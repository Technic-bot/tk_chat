05-06-2019T00:18:52,RimaDraws,Aww cute. Night guys gotta try to sleep
05-06-2019T02:45:32,SpazztasticKiwi,I wonder if it‚Äôs possible to wean yourself off sleep

05-06-2019T06:45:22,RimaDraws,I just woke back up so am dead to the world
05-06-2019T08:14:34,Dadrobit,"Had a really shit night (had to fire another guard, she fell asleep) but I came home to some pretty cool news https://twitter.com/MesaPD/status/1136388494362759168"
05-06-2019T08:16:50,Dadrobit,My brother is a manager at a pet store and he was the one who brought the kitten in to a vet the other day after it had been found beaten to within an inch of its ninth life.
05-06-2019T08:17:23,Dadrobit,The kitten pulled through and is with a family now.
05-06-2019T08:17:52,Dadrobit,"Very cool to see this shit sucking maggot get caught, I hope he gets his in court."

05-06-2019T12:43:22,AspiringNoodle,"Tom, do you think a barn-sized banner would get the message across?"
05-06-2019T12:44:04,iliar,Hi Tom.
05-06-2019T12:47:05,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-nibsbounce:
05-06-2019T12:47:14,Twokinds,No
05-06-2019T13:04:17,AspiringNoodle,"Yeah, I get the feeling that she could tell Eric in explicit and vulgar detail exactly what she wants to do with Eric, and his response would be ""?""."
05-06-2019T13:04:32,AspiringNoodle,"But she'd never do that, because she's too sweet and kind"
05-06-2019T13:05:07,AspiringNoodle,"Also, find Batman, he trained his body to be fully rested on just 2 hours of sleep.  It's the closest you'll get to never needing to sleep again! D:"

05-06-2019T13:08:03,AspiringNoodle,Wouldn't you like to only ever need 2 hours of sleep a night?

05-06-2019T16:33:56,Mippy,Hello my peeps! If all goes according to plan I get three streams this weekend. Also I had to deal with a literal dumpster fire just a half hour ago.
05-06-2019T16:37:45,SpazztasticKiwi,It rained. The track is wet but it‚Äôs also overcast so no sun in the eyes
05-06-2019T16:37:58,SpazztasticKiwi,and I saw a wee squirrel
05-06-2019T16:38:17,AspiringNoodle,Mippy could've used that rain
05-06-2019T16:38:31,AspiringNoodle,"Also, awwwwwww:ptv-excited:"
05-06-2019T16:39:13,Mippy,It is poring rain...and somehow we still had a dumpster fire! :ptv-angry:
05-06-2019T16:39:53,Mippy,That‚Äôs what we get for having coverd dumpster
05-06-2019T16:52:03,tehbear,Kiwi was on a track? Out hiking?
05-06-2019T16:52:43,SpazztasticKiwi,3ish miles in. Break

05-06-2019T17:07:58,tehbear,speaking of animal sightings. i saw a moose this morning. but didnt notice it before i was 20m from it
05-06-2019T17:08:09,Twokinds,That seems bad
05-06-2019T17:08:20,tehbear,it was running away from me
05-06-2019T17:08:43,tehbear,"but i was looking at the mailman beside the road, who was looking at it"
05-06-2019T17:08:56,tehbear,"and then the oncoming car, which was going very slowly to not crash"
05-06-2019T17:10:24,tehbear,it was sunny and right in front of it. so im quite surprised i didnt see it
05-06-2019T17:11:38,tehbear,come to think of it. me and the moose were probably traveling at the same speed. and i was focusing to close or too far ahead
05-06-2019T17:30:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom did you wean from sleep yet
05-06-2019T17:33:44,RimaDraws,@Twokinds I have a question. Do you by chance sell physical copies of the dragon masquerade or have any?
05-06-2019T17:45:04,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
05-06-2019T17:58:55,SpazztasticKiwi,This couple that was on the track with me earlier is now over on the swings. Dudes pushing her and they‚Äôre being all cute and I‚Äôm like

05-06-2019T19:29:26,Twokinds,Yeah I was pretty happy with it
05-06-2019T19:29:53,MuonNeutrino,"so in practice it's, what, two images or a two-sided print or what?"
05-06-2019T19:30:19,MuonNeutrino,or did you get nora to 'improve' it so it actually changes >.>
05-06-2019T19:30:23,Twokinds,Yeah it's two-sided.
05-06-2019T19:31:57,SpazztasticKiwi,So which side will you sign
05-06-2019T19:32:07,Twokinds,Uh...
05-06-2019T19:32:17,Twokinds,I'll ask which form they prefer
05-06-2019T19:32:25,MuonNeutrino,"half of the signature on each side, of course ^^"
05-06-2019T19:37:05,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúWhich side you want me to sign?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes‚Äù
05-06-2019T19:38:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm guessing they‚Äôre for dragoncon or something

05-06-2019T21:31:11,SpazztasticKiwi,who came up with helium beer and why
05-06-2019T21:36:27,RimaDraws,If it was possible how can I obtain two copies of DM if I can‚Äôt attend anthrocon? Also will magical mishaps be available for a pre order after the cons? @Twokinds

05-06-2019T22:26:57,SpazztasticKiwi,"if it‚Äôs been 15 so years. Maybe a print per year, minus maybe the first couple years"
05-06-2019T22:27:16,SpazztasticKiwi,should be
05-06-2019T22:27:40,RimaDraws,I also heard there was that flora tiger in the stars poster?

05-06-2019T22:44:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"And as unrelated as it is, I looked up Starfox after Tom mentioned him - it begs the question why they didn‚Äôt bring him and a number of other characters in"
