15-03-2019T01:03:46,SageSaga,Nyna's butt is a key feature of hers :P
15-03-2019T01:03:51,TheBeckoner,Hmm
15-03-2019T01:03:55,ZRO4825,I am always angry.
15-03-2019T01:03:57,TheBeckoner,Is the panel removable?
15-03-2019T01:03:59,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-ohmy: oh thi panel

15-03-2019T01:04:27,Bgrmystr2,Censorship!
15-03-2019T01:04:35,TheBeckoner,I think the panel is butts actually
15-03-2019T01:05:05,Bgrmystr2,Close enough.
15-03-2019T01:05:33,Bgrmystr2,came back just to angry
15-03-2019T01:05:37,Bgrmystr2,if that's acceptable
15-03-2019T01:13:27,SageSaga,is this best Nyna panel?

15-03-2019T01:25:30,Bgrmystr2,"twice, that damn tail lol"
15-03-2019T01:25:36,Bgrmystr2,"also, dat butt"
15-03-2019T01:29:40,Katfeathers,I see AI is still in spicy mode
15-03-2019T01:30:42,SageSaga,this is pretty much it- they are still mostly naked in the next one but the conversation shifts
15-03-2019T01:31:07,SageSaga,soon after that- the chapter ends :P
15-03-2019T01:31:09,Bgrmystr2,will there be more spicy mode later in the comic? Or is that the end of it
15-03-2019T01:31:24,TheBeckoner,plz more spice
15-03-2019T01:31:35,SageSaga,there will be many herbs and spices but not all of them will be sex...
15-03-2019T01:31:55,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-unimpressed: sage pls no
15-03-2019T01:32:08,Bgrmystr2,also yes :ptv-excited:
15-03-2019T01:32:21,Raventail,Spicy Girls?
15-03-2019T01:32:33,Bgrmystr2,nonono we already had the spice girls
15-03-2019T01:32:37,Bgrmystr2,no need to have them again.
15-03-2019T01:32:57,SageSaga,i show a Werewolf girl in the next chapter for a bit... that should make at least one person happy
15-03-2019T01:33:22,Bgrmystr2,"if I like her, consider it 2 ppl. Unless you mean me, then yeah at least one."
15-03-2019T01:33:28,Bgrmystr2,but probably 2.
15-03-2019T01:33:45,Mihari,She almost dies
15-03-2019T01:33:46,Raventail,"Where'd you get the bouncy mouse gif, SageSaga?"
15-03-2019T01:33:55,Bgrmystr2,it says on the gif lol
15-03-2019T01:33:59,SageSaga,there is no bouncy mouse
15-03-2019T01:34:06,Bgrmystr2,"well, yeah that too"
15-03-2019T01:34:52,Bgrmystr2,y u spoiler mihari
15-03-2019T01:35:05,Mihari,i spoiled nothing XD
15-03-2019T01:35:26,Bgrmystr2,she almost dies isn't a spoiler? lol
15-03-2019T01:35:44,Mihari,"Not really, but you'll understand why when it gets there"
15-03-2019T01:36:12,Bgrmystr2,ehhh~ :ptv-wondering:
15-03-2019T01:36:19,Mihari,It will make sense
15-03-2019T01:36:22,Bgrmystr2,okay then.
15-03-2019T01:36:35,Bgrmystr2,"sounds pretty spoiler to me tho, knowing zero context lol"
15-03-2019T01:36:38,Mihari,But saying what I did akin to saying there are explosions in michael bay movies
15-03-2019T01:36:44,SageSaga,did you read that far into the script?
15-03-2019T01:36:52,Mihari,I suggested it!
15-03-2019T01:37:02,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
15-03-2019T01:37:05,Mihari,I gave you the exact line! XD
15-03-2019T01:41:35,SageSaga,ok - i know why i couldnt remember it- thats when they go there- not when they get confronted in the next chapter
15-03-2019T01:41:52,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
15-03-2019T01:42:32,SageSaga,Mihari had told me she didnt read the entire script and something similar happens in the script- but what shes talking about is way later XD
15-03-2019T01:43:44,Mihari,That's more interesting anyway :P
15-03-2019T01:44:35,Bgrmystr2,is this where we need a 'goddamnit mihari' tag for things like this? :ptv-laugh:
15-03-2019T01:48:00,SageSaga,Mihari is my Editor so she gets access to all the things
15-03-2019T01:48:44,SageSaga,Editor is like one of many titles she has XD
15-03-2019T01:49:50,ZRO4825,Mow
15-03-2019T01:50:28,Bgrmystr2,hey again zro
15-03-2019T01:50:45,SageSaga,this might be a little odd- ive changed the format a bit
15-03-2019T01:51:08,Bgrmystr2,how do you mean
15-03-2019T01:51:24,SageSaga,AI has been in 11x17 format but doesnt have correct margins for printing- so ive been editing all the old pages to fit properly
15-03-2019T01:51:48,SageSaga,this will be the first page i make that shouldnt require any formatting changes
15-03-2019T01:52:14,Bgrmystr2,ahh
15-03-2019T01:54:46,SageSaga,all the previous ones dont have to worry about being upsampled- so they wont have any kinda stretching or artifacting or anything like that
15-03-2019T01:55:11,SageSaga,but this will make it easier with less editing for print
15-03-2019T01:56:11,SageSaga,im thinking future books will also only be 3 chapters and not 6
15-03-2019T01:56:52,SageSaga,smaller books- cheaper to print- i can sell em cheaper
15-03-2019T02:29:47,SageSaga,almost done
15-03-2019T02:30:02,SageSaga,wow we lost a lot of people tonight
15-03-2019T02:33:16,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Some are just too weak willed to make it this far
15-03-2019T02:36:19,Dadrobit,And I'm back
15-03-2019T02:36:31,MarvTheHugPharaoh,WB father
15-03-2019T02:36:36,Dadrobit,Thank you.
15-03-2019T02:38:36,Dadrobit,"Hey, Sage. If worst comes to worst and the kickstarter doesn't make it to 8.5k, would you re-run it with the 3 chapter less expensive run to get the physical media out in at least that form?"
15-03-2019T02:39:19,SageSaga,I dunno- I specifically wrote 0-5 to go together
15-03-2019T02:41:02,SageSaga,my hope is for it to succeed and that i can get some before the convention to sell at Anthrocon
15-03-2019T02:41:25,Dadrobit,"Ah, that makes sense."
15-03-2019T02:43:49,SageSaga,if it fails- i wont really have anything to sell at Anthrocon
15-03-2019T02:46:00,Dadrobit,"Didn't you get into printing dakis? I mean, Ideally you'd have more than just those..."
15-03-2019T02:46:40,SageSaga,i only have 2 left of Kaylin
15-03-2019T02:46:44,SageSaga,and i cant afford to buy more
15-03-2019T02:46:52,Dadrobit,Not profitable?
15-03-2019T02:47:12,SageSaga,they can be but its a big down payment to buy them to begin with
15-03-2019T02:47:48,SageSaga,so yes i made a profit from them - but I then had to spend all that profit fixing a car i dont even own anymore...
15-03-2019T02:48:18,TheBeckoner,"Darn I made it most of the way, but Im goin to bed. Night y'all. thanks for streamin Sage"
15-03-2019T02:48:41,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nighty night becku

15-03-2019T11:25:01,Xexanoth,he confused flora with another tigress :ptv-kippi:
15-03-2019T11:33:24,Twokinds,"I had a crazy number of dreams last night. Felt like I didn't sleep at all, just constant dreams."
15-03-2019T11:33:48,Ordithus,"Tom, I think that's how dreams work.  You're sleeping."
15-03-2019T11:34:23,Twokinds,It didn't feel like sleeping.
15-03-2019T11:34:34,Twokinds,Most of the dreams were about how tired I was.
15-03-2019T11:34:40,Ordithus,Irony
15-03-2019T11:34:43,Twokinds,I had one where I hadn't slept in 3 days.
15-03-2019T11:34:43,Xexanoth,^
15-03-2019T11:35:52,Twokinds,Also the fact that people remember dreams because they're waking up repeatedly.
15-03-2019T11:35:59,Twokinds,It wasn't exactly the best night's sleep.
15-03-2019T11:36:25,Mihari,Sorry to hear.
15-03-2019T11:36:37,Mihari,Think you can manage a nap or something later?
15-03-2019T11:37:09,Twokinds,No I can't stand naps. Makes me feel awful.
15-03-2019T11:37:19,Mihari,"Hehe, fair, I can't nap either. XD"
15-03-2019T11:38:08,Ordithus,"Same.  Coffee helps, but only so much"
15-03-2019T11:40:54,Xexanoth,"eh, just do the usual aka telling yourself that your gonna go to bed early to make up for lost sleep and then don't do that. :P"
15-03-2019T11:44:48,Twokinds,That's what I don't do all the time!
15-03-2019T11:47:08,SpazztasticKiwi,I slept like dead
15-03-2019T11:47:14,SpazztasticKiwi,And now I have coffee
15-03-2019T11:53:05,TheBeckoner,"I slept pretty bad last night, but I think thats because my dog was in my bed."
15-03-2019T12:05:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Who did this https://ifunny.co/picture/after-jason-gets-his-tax-return-s6PqrSYY6
15-03-2019T12:11:28,TheBeckoner,Kiwi plz thats a normie meme

15-03-2019T12:35:45,SpazztasticKiwi,“Why are you a me size people?”
15-03-2019T12:35:56,SpazztasticKiwi,“Calling me short?!”
15-03-2019T13:05:30,Dadrobit,"Not gonna lie, that ""Jason"" link had me very confused. I opened it and for a solid 15 seconds couldn't for the life of me figure out how it related to Infinite."
15-03-2019T13:09:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Honestly it’d be interesting to see either do tax returns
15-03-2019T13:11:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Jason technically still lives with his mother. And by technical definition she’s disabled so he kinda has a dependent
15-03-2019T13:24:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera’s been fed but he’s still just sitting here staring at me

15-03-2019T15:31:17,SpazztasticKiwi,totally
15-03-2019T15:36:20,SageSaga,wholesome conversation- like - does sweat naturally make something look more lewd?
15-03-2019T15:36:38,Bgrmystr2,"not always, but sometimes...?"
15-03-2019T15:37:18,Mippy,I think it depends. 600lbs person sweating because they took two steps....neh!
15-03-2019T15:37:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Depends on the expression
15-03-2019T15:37:46,Bgrmystr2,you don't really need to see the expression though
15-03-2019T15:38:11,Bgrmystr2,but it does help

15-03-2019T15:44:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Meanwhile all you can do is smell it

15-03-2019T16:18:39,SageSaga,the other option would be to cover their bodies with speech bubbles

15-03-2019T16:38:38,Dadrobit,I legit dunno how I managed that one.
15-03-2019T16:39:14,CrimsonQuill,I can't really understand why people would keep pet constrictors.
15-03-2019T16:39:24,CrimsonQuill,"Pythons, boas, it's dangerous."
15-03-2019T16:39:56,Bgrmystr2,that's more Ctrl+C fail
15-03-2019T16:40:01,Bgrmystr2,since it didn't copy the link you wanted
15-03-2019T16:41:39,Dadrobit,"Yeah, dunno wtf went on there."
15-03-2019T16:42:41,CrimsonQuill,I don't really use Ctrl-c.
15-03-2019T16:42:45,CrimsonQuill,I just right click

15-03-2019T16:44:11,Bgrmystr2,you should use it
15-03-2019T16:44:23,Bgrmystr2,faster to do that than right click and finding the copy in the menu
15-03-2019T16:44:32,Dadrobit,And she's a fine snake. Very chill. Only time she ever even came close to aggressive with me was one time when we were moving her to a larger enclosure and she was still stressed adjusting to the new place.
15-03-2019T16:44:42,Dadrobit,Hotkeys are life.
15-03-2019T16:45:30,Dadrobit,Even today when we were wrestling her out from the corner she found she was totally chill with us.

15-03-2019T17:32:51,CrimsonQuill,What flavour Tom?
15-03-2019T17:33:19,Twokinds,"It's a beef soup, with carrots and potatoes. My dad's old recipe."
15-03-2019T17:33:23,Twokinds,It's so good!
15-03-2019T17:33:32,CrimsonQuill,Ooooh
15-03-2019T17:33:39,CrimsonQuill,Sounds delicious.
15-03-2019T17:33:43,Twokinds,"This is probably the best one I've made in a while. Basic, but hearty."
15-03-2019T17:33:53,CrimsonQuill,My mum likes to cook soup.
15-03-2019T17:34:22,CrimsonQuill,"When we have a bird carcass, she boils it for stock, adds veg and other bits, and the end result is delicious."
15-03-2019T17:34:44,CrimsonQuill,Basic but hearty is all we really need from soup.
15-03-2019T17:34:50,CrimsonQuill,:ctwokinds-rainehappy:
15-03-2019T17:37:42,Twokinds,It's even better later. After a few days it basically turns into stew.
15-03-2019T17:37:50,iliar,"Tom, you not answered on email, so I repeat the question:"
15-03-2019T17:38:00,iliar,I am curious. You said the pages of Magical Mishaps not allowed for Nora Cards. But what about single frame?
15-03-2019T17:38:02,CrimsonQuill,I'd love to try it
15-03-2019T17:38:12,iliar,"For example 4-th frame of Magical Mishaps - Story 1 Page 13. I think it's will be looks good as separate art, I mean with face, background, etc."
15-03-2019T17:38:22,Twokinds,The wedding one?
15-03-2019T17:38:38,iliar,Yes
15-03-2019T17:39:38,Azumachan,It's a nice one.
15-03-2019T17:39:41,iliar,"In fact, I prefer the outfit on frame 2. But it seems to me how a separate art wedding dress would look better."
15-03-2019T17:40:13,Azumachan,The lingerie one ?
15-03-2019T17:40:36,Twokinds,Hmmm...
15-03-2019T17:41:07,Twokinds,"I already plan to color all the pages eventually, but I could make a full-effort version of that panel"
15-03-2019T17:41:37,Twokinds,"If it's okay that I can use the full version for that panel in the final comic, then I'd say it's okay."
15-03-2019T17:43:22,Bgrmystr2,I haven't seen the page so I dunno what outfits anyone is on about :c
15-03-2019T17:43:46,iliar,"I am aware of your plans. But I thought that nothing bad would happen if one of the panels was as a separate art. Yes, and color this page will be a little easier."
15-03-2019T17:43:48,CrimsonQuill,I'm going to bed. Goodnight all.

15-03-2019T17:55:21,iliar,"Fine. Although, 2AM in my time zone, so I plan go to sleep."
15-03-2019T17:56:09,Azumachan,It's already late ; Take care then.
15-03-2019T19:08:48,RimaDraws,hi
15-03-2019T19:25:04,CrRAR,top o the evenin' Rima
15-03-2019T19:25:11,CrRAR,:four_leaf_clover:
15-03-2019T19:27:01,RimaDraws,hiii
15-03-2019T19:38:45,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m probably gonna try crossing a tarot idea with March
15-03-2019T19:45:51,RimaDraws,i am stuck on an idea
15-03-2019T19:55:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve also been looking though more Inuyasha
15-03-2019T19:56:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Makes me with Inutoshi was still alive so he could crack those two boys heads together
15-03-2019T20:04:27,CommanderTrace,Hello guys :ptv-greetings:
15-03-2019T20:05:04,CrRAR,heyo commander
15-03-2019T20:05:44,CommanderTrace,:ptv-greetings:
15-03-2019T21:37:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I live
15-03-2019T21:37:33,SpazztasticKiwi,With food
15-03-2019T22:08:18,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-KatDance: I too live.
15-03-2019T22:22:49,SpazztasticKiwi,I need someone to give me a good list of the main characters
15-03-2019T22:23:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I need to find out who all I’ve got down as tarots and who I dont
15-03-2019T22:24:20,Bgrmystr2,"you can probably surmise that any main characters would be in Trace's group. Prolly Trace, Flora, Keith, and Natani at minimum."
15-03-2019T22:24:24,Ordithus,"Define ""main"" in this comic"
15-03-2019T22:24:34,Ordithus,"I'd argue Raine, too"
15-03-2019T22:24:38,Bgrmystr2,Everyone else is likely a supporting character.
15-03-2019T22:24:48,Bgrmystr2,I dunno.
15-03-2019T22:24:51,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s 22 major arcana
15-03-2019T22:25:08,SpazztasticKiwi,For the sake of Toms sanity I’m keeping it there so I need the top 22
15-03-2019T22:25:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Rainer has a card
15-03-2019T22:25:27,Bgrmystr2,Raine doesn't seem like a main character. She's a supporting character but has major plot points surrounding her.
15-03-2019T22:25:27,Ordithus,Everyone in the most recent anniversary picture
15-03-2019T22:25:29,Ordithus,Then
15-03-2019T22:25:34,Bgrmystr2,I don't think that makes her a main though.
15-03-2019T22:25:45,Ordithus,She is definitely the most major character of squad B
15-03-2019T22:25:52,Bgrmystr2,well yeah for sure
15-03-2019T22:25:59,Ordithus,"And I suspect she has a larger role to play, but that's speculation"
15-03-2019T22:26:06,Bgrmystr2,I feel the same
15-03-2019T22:26:43,Ordithus,(watch as Tom shifts the entire comic to follow Evals on his adventures)
15-03-2019T22:26:55,Bgrmystr2,plot twist xD
15-03-2019T22:27:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I even have Adelaide down as one
15-03-2019T22:29:30,Ordithus,Since you said 22...
15-03-2019T22:29:32,Ordithus,"Most recurring characters: Trace, Flora, Natani, Keith, Kathrin, Eric, Zen, Raine, Sythe, Maren, Karen, ""Red"", Adelaide, Madelyn, Euchre, Edmund Sirius, Mike, Evals, Nora, Reni, Roselyn, Saria"
15-03-2019T22:31:02,Ordithus,Wow that is actually 22 somehow
15-03-2019T22:31:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Nora Reni Kat Karen Maren Eric Flora(she’s been done already) Raine Adelaide have one for sure
15-03-2019T22:33:43,Ordithus,"Laura, Brahn, and Clovis should fit in there somewhere..."
15-03-2019T22:44:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Clovis can technically fit two
15-03-2019T22:47:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I wanted to put Kat as the Empress but
15-03-2019T22:48:12,SpazztasticKiwi,The Empress is the card of nurturing femininity and beauty
15-03-2019T22:48:18,SpazztasticKiwi,But also fertility
15-03-2019T22:48:27,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-katwet:
15-03-2019T22:49:36,Ordithus,Cathleen?
15-03-2019T22:50:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I have no one for Empress based on that
15-03-2019T22:51:00,Ordithus,Adira or Adelaide might fit
15-03-2019T22:51:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Adelaide has one
15-03-2019T22:51:30,SpazztasticKiwi,She’s the Emperor
15-03-2019T22:53:22,SpazztasticKiwi,"Strong authority, order, a leading spirit. And getting it in a reading means you need to get your shit together"
15-03-2019T22:53:36,Ordithus,Is that the Emperor?
15-03-2019T22:54:02,SpazztasticKiwi,The breadwinner - people depend on you so keep it together
15-03-2019T22:54:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah
15-03-2019T22:55:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Though maybe more - “you’re the head bacon bringer so keep it up you strong leader you
15-03-2019T22:56:03,Ordithus,mmm bacon
15-03-2019T22:56:53,Ordithus,"Maren I think could also work for Empress.  She is the Ice Queen, after all :ptv-snicker:"
15-03-2019T22:58:20,SpazztasticKiwi,The upright reading that is
15-03-2019T22:58:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Maren fits as the chariot
15-03-2019T22:59:31,Ordithus,Ooh I get that (thank you google)
15-03-2019T23:00:10,SpazztasticKiwi,"Control, willpower, I will do as I have determined my path to be"
15-03-2019T23:00:14,SpazztasticKiwi,In a nutshell
15-03-2019T23:00:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Meanwhile Karen is organized chaos. The Sun
15-03-2019T23:00:51,Ordithus,haha
15-03-2019T23:03:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Now with Clovis there’s the Moon or the Devil
15-03-2019T23:03:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Illusion deceit and ye who beckons uses lies and will strike
15-03-2019T23:03:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Or
15-03-2019T23:04:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"Sexuality, the path of instant gratification, and attachment (to money)"
15-03-2019T23:04:42,SpazztasticKiwi,In a nutshell
15-03-2019T23:04:56,Ordithus,Yeah that be Clovis
15-03-2019T23:07:59,Ordithus,"If there's one for ""sexy beast"" that'd be Sythe :ptv-ohmy:"
15-03-2019T23:12:13,SpazztasticKiwi,The only ones having reference to sexuality is The Lovers and The Devil
15-03-2019T23:16:14,SpazztasticKiwi,But it’s probably enough headache for the day. I’m likely going with Lady Luck for this round
15-03-2019T23:19:12,Ordithus,Who's that?
15-03-2019T23:27:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Wheel of Fortune
