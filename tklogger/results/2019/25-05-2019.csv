25-05-2019T13:58:44,RimaDraws,no both good
25-05-2019T13:59:23,RimaDraws,i give aladdin 8/10 tho because changes and a couple new songs. but its a fair one. i like the attire and music. so i am biased. but detective pikachu is 10/10 indeed
25-05-2019T13:59:43,RimaDraws,omg my mind was blown away with it
25-05-2019T14:00:39,ProsePro7,No Robin Williams no go.  I'm biased
25-05-2019T14:01:01,RimaDraws,i think in aladdin a couple songs were unnecessary and yea robin williams will always be my genie. will smith did an alright job
25-05-2019T14:01:10,RimaDraws,and robin williams is dead and gone so

25-05-2019T14:16:28,Bgrmystr2,There's holographic concerts with singers that aren't even real people.
25-05-2019T14:16:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Also imagine you‚Äôre a part of an anime where characters are animals of the zodiac who poof into their animal form when hugged by the opposite sex
25-05-2019T14:16:44,Bgrmystr2,"so.. you don't even need to be a real person, nevermind once being alive."

25-05-2019T14:17:52,SpazztasticKiwi,The most accurate representation but it makes things awkward when you‚Äôre around when it happens
25-05-2019T14:18:11,SpazztasticKiwi,happy to see you‚Äôre happy when you‚Äôre productive

25-05-2019T16:36:15,FloofyCat,Probably gunna be some hyper-expensive thing that barely works.
25-05-2019T16:36:23,FloofyCat,"Indeed, that is one lovely blep."

25-05-2019T19:10:07,Bgrmystr2,I like how we think of this suggestion as if flora would let him get rid of all the carpet. She'll keep one stashed.. hidden away.
25-05-2019T19:10:19,TeapotOfDoom,Trace using magic to turn into a Keidran and get sweet revenge
25-05-2019T19:10:23,Bgrmystr2,and then this happens lol
25-05-2019T19:10:25,Katfeathers,or magic the rugs into hardwood
25-05-2019T19:10:29,AspiringNoodle,The question is... would Rose LET her keep it?
25-05-2019T19:10:45,Bgrmystr2,I think rose would probably find this more funny than anything else to be honest lol

25-05-2019T21:28:05,AspiringNoodle,Zen 2 is potentially the product that finally dethrones Intel as the performance king.
25-05-2019T21:28:10,TraceLegacyXI,I can‚Äôt see straight
25-05-2019T21:28:19,TraceLegacyXI,Help
25-05-2019T21:28:21,AspiringNoodle,Intel is crazy pricey compared to the Performance per dollar AMD offers
25-05-2019T21:28:28,Bgrmystr2,can't help
25-05-2019T21:28:34,Bgrmystr2,yeah noodle
25-05-2019T21:28:35,TraceLegacyXI,Oh god
25-05-2019T21:28:41,AspiringNoodle,And part of the reason they can get away with it is because their processors still hold higher single-thread performance.
25-05-2019T21:28:48,TraceLegacyXI,I think I broke my arm just now
25-05-2019T21:28:58,TraceLegacyXI,Oops?

25-05-2019T21:29:08,AspiringNoodle,Buuuuut Zen 2 is potentially about to rip that title away from Intel.  Or get so close that you can't really justify buying Intel anymore.
25-05-2019T21:29:12,TraceLegacyXI,Dangit
25-05-2019T21:29:19,TraceLegacyXI,You got me
25-05-2019T21:29:37,AspiringNoodle,"Trace, imagine this"
25-05-2019T21:29:50,AspiringNoodle,$500 gets you an Intel 9900k with 8 cores / 16 threads.
25-05-2019T21:29:55,TraceLegacyXI,Ok I‚Äôm imaginig
25-05-2019T21:30:03,TraceLegacyXI,And it‚Äôs paradice
25-05-2019T21:30:12,TraceLegacyXI,I spelled that wrong didn‚Äôt I?
25-05-2019T21:30:26,AspiringNoodle,"What if for the same $500, you can buy a 12-16 core processor with 24 - 32 threads for $500.  And it's single-core performance is the same, if not higher, than Intel."
25-05-2019T21:30:37,AspiringNoodle,Which would you buy?
25-05-2019T21:30:39,TraceLegacyXI,It‚Äôs heaven
25-05-2019T21:30:45,Bgrmystr2,and the multi-core would be way better.
25-05-2019T21:30:55,TraceLegacyXI,500 for 12-16.
25-05-2019T21:31:01,TraceLegacyXI,Definitely
25-05-2019T21:31:19,AspiringNoodle,And that's why Intel is potentially f***ed
25-05-2019T21:31:28,TraceLegacyXI,Nice
25-05-2019T21:31:35,AspiringNoodle,This presentation will either confirm or dispel the rumors / leaks up until now.
25-05-2019T21:31:45,Bgrmystr2,omfg 62 cores
25-05-2019T21:31:55,TraceLegacyXI,Ok so do either of you play Destiny 2?
25-05-2019T21:32:01,Bgrmystr2,no
25-05-2019T21:32:13,AspiringNoodle,I might in the future.  Backlog + underpowered computer ^^;
25-05-2019T21:32:21,TraceLegacyXI,Random out of the blue question
25-05-2019T21:32:41,TraceLegacyXI,How about Fortnite?
25-05-2019T21:32:43,AspiringNoodle,"Also, I want to take up digital art.  I've been procrastinating for 13 years..."
25-05-2019T21:33:03,AspiringNoodle,"Tried it, couldn't get into it.  The building aspect irritated the shite out of me."
25-05-2019T21:33:08,Bgrmystr2,daaaamn are you seeing this noodle
25-05-2019T21:33:15,TraceLegacyXI,Good luck noodle
25-05-2019T21:33:34,AspiringNoodle,Didn't but I know they're talking scientific simulationr ight now
25-05-2019T21:33:51,TraceLegacyXI,"All my brother wants to do these days is Fortnite, and it‚Äôs kinda ruined the game for me"
25-05-2019T21:34:00,AspiringNoodle,Oof... rip Intel
25-05-2019T21:34:02,Bgrmystr2,the two AMD CPU was twice as fast as two intel's cpus
25-05-2019T21:34:21,TraceLegacyXI,Hey do you guys know where Tom went?
25-05-2019T21:34:28,AspiringNoodle,Sleep? xD
25-05-2019T21:34:31,TraceLegacyXI,By any chance?
25-05-2019T21:34:34,Bgrmystr2,tom always takes a break after the stream
25-05-2019T21:34:37,TraceLegacyXI,Oh lol
25-05-2019T21:34:48,TraceLegacyXI,Whoops.
25-05-2019T21:34:49,AspiringNoodle,"And I get you.  Fortnite is EVERYWHERE, and it's kinda annoying..."
25-05-2019T21:35:17,AspiringNoodle,"Also, people don't realize that the only reason Fortnite is updated so frequently is because they're using the worst tactics for game development possible."
25-05-2019T21:35:21,AspiringNoodle,"Namely, the overuse of crunch."
25-05-2019T21:35:44,AspiringNoodle,I SWEAR TO NORA I WILL MURDER THIS CROUD
25-05-2019T21:35:49,AspiringNoodle,crowd*
25-05-2019T21:35:54,AspiringNoodle,There wouldn't be a difference
25-05-2019T21:36:12,Bgrmystr2,lool
25-05-2019T21:36:26,TraceLegacyXI,"Dude; that‚Äôs some craft stuff, doing a Nora swear"
25-05-2019T21:36:36,TraceLegacyXI,Crazy not craft.
25-05-2019T21:36:42,TraceLegacyXI,STUPID AUTOCORRECT
25-05-2019T21:37:12,AspiringNoodle,I have a LOT of money saved up for this system...
25-05-2019T21:37:17,TraceLegacyXI,I feel like every single god blessed time I come on this thing autocorrect screws something up at least once.
25-05-2019T21:37:28,TraceLegacyXI,I hate it
25-05-2019T21:37:31,TraceLegacyXI,So
25-05-2019T21:37:41,AspiringNoodle,It's taken many years of birthday / Christmas money. And I've saved up more just waiting for this next generation of Zen
25-05-2019T21:37:42,TraceLegacyXI,Very much
25-05-2019T21:38:00,AspiringNoodle,Here's something I neglected to mention earlier
25-05-2019T21:38:08,TraceLegacyXI,Oh. Cool. Zen 2 sounds pretty dope
25-05-2019T21:38:19,AspiringNoodle,AMD kinda handicapped Zen 1 in multiple ways.
25-05-2019T21:38:29,TraceLegacyXI,...oof
25-05-2019T21:38:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom might just be creepin. Waiting to pop in a point of a good conversation. Or he‚Äôs been sucked in by the inking monster
25-05-2019T21:38:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Again
25-05-2019T21:38:55,TraceLegacyXI,I think ima go to bed. I‚Äôm sick :p
25-05-2019T21:39:03,TraceLegacyXI,:(
25-05-2019T21:39:05,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúMust. Work. Things. To do.‚Äù
25-05-2019T21:39:14,AspiringNoodle,"Ryzen generations 1 and 2 can actually support 32 PCIe lanes.  But to cut costs (and guarantee production), the motherboards only give you 20 usable lanes."
25-05-2019T21:39:26,TraceLegacyXI,Gnight everyone
25-05-2019T21:39:31,AspiringNoodle,That's the first way they helped push them out.
25-05-2019T21:39:52,AspiringNoodle,The 2nd thing was using a low-power process that limits clock speeds / power draw.
25-05-2019T21:40:08,AspiringNoodle,Zen 2 will be dropping the 2nd part. :)
25-05-2019T21:40:29,SpazztasticKiwi,I may join him in such an endeavor - return when there‚Äôs something of interest I guess
25-05-2019T21:40:47,SpazztasticKiwi,For now - Fruits Basket
25-05-2019T21:40:51,AspiringNoodle,The danger of working from home:  You want to keep working always all the time everyday.
25-05-2019T21:41:06,SpazztasticKiwi,The reboot is too pretty
25-05-2019T21:41:54,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-natsducky:
25-05-2019T21:43:34,AspiringNoodle,I wish I was gonna put navi in my next computer...
25-05-2019T21:46:54,AspiringNoodle,*sigh*
25-05-2019T21:46:57,Bgrmystr2,AAAA July
25-05-2019T21:47:04,AspiringNoodle,"It's nice, but it's not 2080+ levels of performance :("
25-05-2019T21:47:14,AspiringNoodle,I have a 1440p monitor.  I need a 2080 minimum
25-05-2019T21:47:18,Bgrmystr2,"maybe, but it's not gonna be $1400."
25-05-2019T21:47:24,AspiringNoodle,Alsooo... Gsync xD
25-05-2019T21:47:32,Bgrmystr2,Freesync bro.
25-05-2019T21:47:45,AspiringNoodle,I know.  But Gsync has a lot more besides VRR tech.
25-05-2019T21:47:56,AspiringNoodle,It more or less guarantees panel quality.
25-05-2019T21:48:16,Bgrmystr2,"From what I have seen, there's literally nothing Gsync can do that freesync cannot do"
25-05-2019T21:48:20,AspiringNoodle,I recommend a recent video by LinusTechTips where they visited Nvidia's building where they certify Gsync panels :D
25-05-2019T21:48:31,Bgrmystr2,yes I saw that.
25-05-2019T21:49:03,AspiringNoodle,On the other hand.  If Navi is cheap enough.  I could potentially buy a Freesync monitor with similar specs.
25-05-2019T21:49:08,Bgrmystr2,I think she's about to drop Ryzen 3000
25-05-2019T21:49:20,AspiringNoodle,Plz be july at the latest!  June preferably
25-05-2019T21:49:36,AspiringNoodle,I've been waiting half a year for this...
25-05-2019T21:49:38,Bgrmystr2,"July would be fine for me, it'll be a good birthday present."
25-05-2019T21:49:55,Bgrmystr2,I've been using the same CPU since the end of 2009
25-05-2019T21:50:00,Bgrmystr2,"you can wait a little bit longer, mate. :)"
25-05-2019T21:50:07,AspiringNoodle,What is it?  I'm using a 3570k xD
25-05-2019T21:50:14,Bgrmystr2,a Phenom II 955
25-05-2019T21:50:43,Bgrmystr2,I didn't have $1000 to pay intel for their bullshit price gouging
25-05-2019T21:50:49,Bgrmystr2,so I paid $165.
25-05-2019T21:51:08,AspiringNoodle,I think my processor was ~$220
25-05-2019T21:51:23,AspiringNoodle,"This thing *could* go farther, but I cheaped out on the cooling."
25-05-2019T21:51:24,Bgrmystr2,less than 1/5 the price for about 1/3 to 1/2 the performance.
25-05-2019T21:51:41,Bgrmystr2,there were no cheaper cpus for me.
25-05-2019T21:51:46,Bgrmystr2,"so I noped out, cuz fuck intel"
25-05-2019T21:51:47,AspiringNoodle,"I'm a bit of a power user, and this thing has trouble keeping up ^^;"
25-05-2019T21:52:13,Bgrmystr2,"I'm a power user as well, I've gone out of my way to make sure everything runs smooth"
25-05-2019T21:52:21,Bgrmystr2,"though I'm not just ""a bit"""
25-05-2019T21:53:07,AspiringNoodle,You heavily overclocking it?
25-05-2019T21:53:15,Bgrmystr2,"nope, stock cooler"
25-05-2019T21:53:45,Bgrmystr2,I've gone through two GPUs and three PSUs
25-05-2019T21:53:49,Bgrmystr2,3 sets of ram
25-05-2019T21:54:02,Bgrmystr2,and three.. if not four hard drives.
25-05-2019T21:54:10,Bgrmystr2,CPU still runs like a champ.
25-05-2019T21:54:38,AspiringNoodle,I went through 2 SSDs in 1.5 years.  Didn't know about RMA at the time.
25-05-2019T21:54:47,Ordithus,Think of how many clock cycles it has seen :ctwokinds-maddiessparkles:
25-05-2019T21:54:48,AspiringNoodle,"This one's lasted, though :D"
25-05-2019T21:55:05,Bgrmystr2,My CPU has seen some shit yes :ptv-shock::ptv-ohmy::ptv-excited:
25-05-2019T21:55:18,Bgrmystr2,especially cycling those clocks.
25-05-2019T21:55:26,AspiringNoodle,I want to build a computer that'll last 10 years (hopefully) without feeling the need for an upgrade besides GPU / storage.
25-05-2019T21:55:28,Bgrmystr2,sexy clocks :alarm_clock::timer::clock:
25-05-2019T21:56:09,Bgrmystr2,I find this AMD Microsoft partnership talked a lot but said a whole lotta nothing.
25-05-2019T21:57:04,Bgrmystr2,"Every time I hear Acer, I just.. ew :ptv-uneasy:"
25-05-2019T21:57:18,Bgrmystr2,3rd party company trying to act like they're a 1st party
25-05-2019T21:57:20,Bgrmystr2,it's sad
25-05-2019T21:58:55,AspiringNoodle,"From what I heard, ASUS is top contender for performance"
25-05-2019T21:59:03,Bgrmystr2,yup
25-05-2019T21:59:06,Bgrmystr2,ASUS is good
25-05-2019T21:59:07,AspiringNoodle,But customer service is just horrible:ptv-snicker:
25-05-2019T21:59:12,Bgrmystr2,Acer on the other hand
25-05-2019T21:59:14,Bgrmystr2,is just sad
25-05-2019T21:59:30,Bgrmystr2,bad quality items advertised as top quality with similar pricing
25-05-2019T21:59:43,AspiringNoodle,"ASUS, GIGABYTE, MSI top 3"
25-05-2019T22:00:06,Bgrmystr2,"I wouldn't say Gigabyte as top, they're like mid-tier, but the high-end of mid tier"
25-05-2019T22:00:23,Bgrmystr2,they don't make super high end stuff
25-05-2019T22:00:32,Bgrmystr2,just good solid stuff
25-05-2019T22:00:36,AspiringNoodle,It was either Gigabyte or MSI that made the best GTX 970
25-05-2019T22:00:58,Bgrmystr2,MSI probably
25-05-2019T22:01:07,Bgrmystr2,but Gigabyte makes some nice motherboards.
25-05-2019T22:01:26,AspiringNoodle,I was thinking of making a black / dark grey / orange red build to honor AMD.
25-05-2019T22:01:47,AspiringNoodle,But now I'm considering black/white/silver because Nora :P
25-05-2019T22:02:05,Bgrmystr2,make the color what you want
25-05-2019T22:02:42,AspiringNoodle,Whatever I make is gonna be aesthetically pleasing :ptv-hearts:
25-05-2019T22:04:40,Bgrmystr2,I wonder if you could open laptops with ryzen 2000 series cpus
25-05-2019T22:04:49,Bgrmystr2,and upgrade the motherboard to use 3000 series
25-05-2019T22:05:04,AspiringNoodle,Depends on whether or not they're soldered in place
25-05-2019T22:05:16,AspiringNoodle,And if you can upgrade the BIOS
25-05-2019T22:06:54,AspiringNoodle,*yawn*
25-05-2019T22:07:00,AspiringNoodle,Zen 2 when?

25-05-2019T22:26:59,AspiringNoodle,The 3800x might be able to hit 5Ghz.  Maybe 4.8 - 4.9
25-05-2019T22:27:34,AspiringNoodle,"ey, I actually predicted it :ptv-hearts:"
25-05-2019T22:27:43,Bgrmystr2,DAMN
25-05-2019T22:27:47,Bgrmystr2,AAAAA
25-05-2019T22:27:50,Bgrmystr2,So fuckin hype
25-05-2019T22:28:52,AspiringNoodle,Haha.  That's brilliant.
25-05-2019T22:28:56,Bgrmystr2,I want to see the 16 core >:T
25-05-2019T22:29:00,Bgrmystr2,but YAAAS
25-05-2019T22:29:04,AspiringNoodle,Shoulda saw that coming
25-05-2019T22:29:06,Bgrmystr2,7/7
25-05-2019T22:29:08,Bgrmystr2,xD
25-05-2019T22:29:17,AspiringNoodle,1.5 months
25-05-2019T22:29:55,AspiringNoodle,"Ofc, I might wait a bit longer.  See which processor reaches the highest single-core clocks.  How much RAM affects performance, etc."
25-05-2019T22:30:30,AspiringNoodle,Then again... 12 cores for $500... that seems pretty future proof
25-05-2019T22:32:50,Bgrmystr2,dude
25-05-2019T22:32:51,AspiringNoodle,Found that old chart of product rumors.  Man they overshot by a mile xD
25-05-2019T22:34:28,Bgrmystr2,"$500 12/24 AMD cpu outperforms a $1,200 Intel 12/24 cpu"
25-05-2019T22:34:35,Bgrmystr2,that's fucking incredible
25-05-2019T22:35:03,AspiringNoodle,"I take that with a grain of salt, because I don't remember them disclosing clock speeds.  But I'm gonna assume out the box stock settings ^^"
25-05-2019T22:37:15,Bgrmystr2,well they did literally just show that cpu in a blender benchmark
25-05-2019T22:37:41,Bgrmystr2,and yes they did
25-05-2019T22:37:48,AspiringNoodle,"Ah, what was it?"
25-05-2019T22:37:55,Bgrmystr2,4.6ghz base 4.8ghz boost
25-05-2019T22:38:37,AspiringNoodle,Probably doesn't matter anyways :P
25-05-2019T22:39:06,AspiringNoodle,"After all, with the way stuff increases in performance generation after generation, it was basically guaranteed that these new processors would be on par with Intel's current offerings."
25-05-2019T22:39:39,Bgrmystr2,"Yeah, and based on what they showed, they're smashing intel hard."
25-05-2019T22:39:53,Bgrmystr2,"Now of course we know that AMD is gonna show stuff that really benefits their cpus, but"
25-05-2019T22:40:05,Bgrmystr2,they also have been caught sandbagging so they don't give away their entire hand
25-05-2019T22:40:12,Bgrmystr2,making themselves seem weaker than they really are.
25-05-2019T22:41:32,AspiringNoodle,"Well, unless Nvidia releases a new generation of RTX cards in the next few months, I'll be buying a 2080."
25-05-2019T22:42:14,AspiringNoodle,That is unless AMD's best performance Navi offering is cheap enough to buy a 1440p monitor with similar settings :)
25-05-2019T22:42:43,Bgrmystr2,"Btw, The Adored TV leak says the Ryzen 9 1800X was a 16core 32 thread for 3.9 base and 4.7 boost for $449."
25-05-2019T22:42:50,Bgrmystr2,3800X* fff
25-05-2019T22:42:53,Bgrmystr2,well
25-05-2019T22:43:14,Bgrmystr2,the Ryzen 9 3800X was apparently a 12 core 24 thread for $500
25-05-2019T22:43:20,AspiringNoodle,I'm pretty sure the 3800X will be able to hit 5Ghz when manually OC'd
25-05-2019T22:43:28,Bgrmystr2,yes absolutely
25-05-2019T22:43:41,AspiringNoodle,Otherwise the .1Ghz boost with an additional 40 TDP would be weird
25-05-2019T22:43:50,Bgrmystr2,and the release processor is 3.8 base 4.6 boost
25-05-2019T22:43:53,AspiringNoodle,"The 12 core, on the other hand, may not."
25-05-2019T22:44:04,AspiringNoodle,"After all, 4 extra cores with the same TDP"
25-05-2019T22:44:27,Bgrmystr2,the specs of the 3800X are equivilant to the 3700 on AdoredTV's leak.
25-05-2019T22:44:48,Bgrmystr2,so I'm wondering if AMD's holding back on some of the bigger processors
25-05-2019T22:45:06,Bgrmystr2,"granted these are leaks so they're not always going to be pinpoint, but we know for sure there's 16core cpus from amd"
25-05-2019T22:45:07,AspiringNoodle,"Well, they aren't launching their 16 core yet, so that's one thing"
25-05-2019T22:45:11,Bgrmystr2,yeah..
25-05-2019T22:45:37,Bgrmystr2,"so AdoredTV thought that CPU would release for $300, it released for $500"
25-05-2019T22:45:44,AspiringNoodle,"I'll be having fun in a month, double checking my funds and coming up with a potential list of parts."
25-05-2019T22:46:48,Bgrmystr2,do you think they're waiting to release 16core till later?
25-05-2019T22:47:09,AspiringNoodle,Definitely.  They're probably holding back to see what Intel does in response
25-05-2019T22:47:15,Bgrmystr2,since that i9 9900k is what everyone bought..
25-05-2019T22:47:45,Bgrmystr2,It's $500 on newegg
25-05-2019T22:48:04,Bgrmystr2,"the CPU that ""competes"" with it is $400."
25-05-2019T22:48:15,AspiringNoodle,"Let's not forget that when AMD launched the 1800X, it was $500 and Intel's 8-core offering was $1000 :P"
25-05-2019T22:48:17,Bgrmystr2,I say that in parenthesis because I don't expect the 9900k to win
25-05-2019T22:48:33,Bgrmystr2,yeah AMD's always been cheaper
25-05-2019T22:49:04,Bgrmystr2,the fact that the 9900k is the highest tier consumer grade CPU intel has on the market says a lot
25-05-2019T22:49:25,Bgrmystr2,cuz the 12 core AMD cpu will flatten it straight up.
25-05-2019T22:49:34,AspiringNoodle,Also their prices don't scale well :ptv-laugh:
25-05-2019T22:49:44,AspiringNoodle,9900k: 8c/16t - $500
25-05-2019T22:49:54,AspiringNoodle,9980XE 18c/36t - $2000
25-05-2019T22:50:58,AspiringNoodle,"That said, I'm surprised that the 12c offering from AMD isn't more expensive.  With the 3800x right below it, they could've gone $600 and it would've been reasonable."
25-05-2019T22:51:31,Bgrmystr2,"yeah Intel's 9920x on Newegg is right now $1,200"
25-05-2019T22:51:53,Bgrmystr2,"and AMD is gonna release a similar cpu for performance at minimum, if not outright outdo it for $500, less than half the price"
25-05-2019T22:52:00,AspiringNoodle,"If Intel doesn't put out something new in 6 months, they're boned..."
25-05-2019T22:52:08,Bgrmystr2,I'm just excited cuz AMD is gonna just.. ow.
25-05-2019T22:52:12,AspiringNoodle,Because AMD is keeping to a yearly release
25-05-2019T22:53:12,Bgrmystr2,man..
25-05-2019T22:53:20,Bgrmystr2,OAMD is actually keeping prices cheap
25-05-2019T22:53:35,AspiringNoodle,I have speculations about that.
25-05-2019T22:53:44,Bgrmystr2,..I'll bet* they're doing that cuz the new CPUs they're gonna come out with next year will flatten what they just released
25-05-2019T22:53:55,Bgrmystr2,I went to edit it and apostrophe thought it was the enter button
25-05-2019T22:53:57,AspiringNoodle,"They're going with a modular approach going forward, with a maximum die size."
25-05-2019T22:54:06,Bgrmystr2,so.. it sent instead of editing like a dumbshit.
25-05-2019T22:54:23,Bgrmystr2,Love my keyboard.. said me never.
25-05-2019T22:54:27,AspiringNoodle,Likely this improves yields.  Intel makes one solid die for the ENTIRE processor.  Doesn't matter how many cores it has.
25-05-2019T22:54:59,Bgrmystr2,AMD is gonna be releasing multithreading like we've never seen before. With 3 and 4 threads per core next year for Zen 3.
25-05-2019T22:55:09,Bgrmystr2,perhaps not next year if it delays but
25-05-2019T22:55:16,AspiringNoodle,Now THAT would be crazy
25-05-2019T22:55:17,Bgrmystr2,tis what the leaks suggest
25-05-2019T22:55:30,Bgrmystr2,we already know they DO plan to release 3-4 threads per cpu
25-05-2019T22:55:36,Bgrmystr2,they have patents on it
25-05-2019T22:55:38,Bgrmystr2,so this is legit
25-05-2019T22:56:01,Bgrmystr2,"whether it comes to terms or not  is up for debate, cuz we dunno, but I'm pretty certain it's not impossible."
25-05-2019T22:56:11,Bgrmystr2,and lots of things have already done more than 2 threads per core
25-05-2019T22:56:18,Bgrmystr2,"but it's never been in a consumer pc ever,."
25-05-2019T22:56:38,AspiringNoodle,It'll likely be 3-4 years down the road at the earliest.
25-05-2019T22:56:49,AspiringNoodle,We're talking a major overhaul of conventional processor design.
25-05-2019T22:57:08,Bgrmystr2,I dunno... based on the roadmap we're seeing.. it doesn't actually look like it'll be that hard. Look how far they came from Zen 1 to zen 2.
25-05-2019T22:57:36,AspiringNoodle,"Then again, I'm just a guy who wants to spend a large sum of money on a computer that'll be relevant for 10+ years ;)"
25-05-2019T22:58:50,AspiringNoodle,The funny thing is that I took the money I was spending on lottery tickets and decided to start saving that money instead.
25-05-2019T22:59:16,AspiringNoodle,"With the money I save doing this, I could build a new computer every 5 years.  AND I would have more funds than I do now, to boot :ptv-hearts:"
25-05-2019T22:59:42,AspiringNoodle,"That said, it doesn't account for things like GPU replacement, or any other additions ^^;"
25-05-2019T23:00:12,Bgrmystr2,"well.. yeah that's how you win money. Instead of playing the lotto and winning literally nothing, don't play and win the price of a ticket.. dozens to hundreds of dollars a month."
25-05-2019T23:00:45,Bgrmystr2,"the lottery is not there for you to win, it's there to make money for the people who host it"
25-05-2019T23:00:57,AspiringNoodle,I don't exactly want to share how much I was spending ._.
25-05-2019T23:01:16,AspiringNoodle,"Let's just say, I could build a nice computer at the ""before diminishing returns"" price point"
25-05-2019T23:01:46,Bgrmystr2,"People here spend bullshit amount of money on it and the nwonder why they didn't win, it's dumb. the odds are like a bajillion to zero cuz none of the winners are actually normal people like us, that's not how it ever worked."
25-05-2019T23:02:23,Bgrmystr2,"anycase, brb"
25-05-2019T23:03:15,AspiringNoodle,"I need to make room on this table.  With the new computer, I might need room for a new monitor."
25-05-2019T23:14:29,Bgrmystr2,"man, this is hype"
25-05-2019T23:14:41,Bgrmystr2,Intel has 6 weeks to drop CPU prices
25-05-2019T23:15:01,Bgrmystr2,sell your intel processors now cuz they're gonna drop between now and the 7th of july
25-05-2019T23:15:23,Bgrmystr2,"If intel does nothing, Ryzen is gonna slaughter them"
25-05-2019T23:16:37,AspiringNoodle,"I plan to use my computers for years until building a new system would be a major upgrade, then just strip any non-boot drives, and gift it to any close people who need a new computer :p"
25-05-2019T23:17:07,Bgrmystr2,"Man, I love the fact that AMD released a cpu competing against a server processor.. for the consumer market."
25-05-2019T23:17:13,Bgrmystr2,for less than half the price
25-05-2019T23:17:13,AspiringNoodle,"Unless I need the money, at which point I get into the used PC business, haha"
25-05-2019T23:17:20,Bgrmystr2,that's fuckin BALLSY
25-05-2019T23:17:53,Bgrmystr2,"not to be shown up with just that, it also outperformed that same processor in the announcement shown worldwide"
25-05-2019T23:18:01,AspiringNoodle,"Well, either Intel's processors really do cost that much for them to make a profit, or they still haven't gotten through their heads that they don't hold a monopoly anymore."
25-05-2019T23:18:44,Bgrmystr2,I think both
25-05-2019T23:19:10,Bgrmystr2,I don't think intel went ham on making an efficient structure for making their cpus
25-05-2019T23:19:42,AspiringNoodle,I might just cry after turning on my new computer for the first time
25-05-2019T23:20:01,AspiringNoodle,Going from a 4c/4t to a 8c/16t or 12c/24t might just be too amazing for me to handle
25-05-2019T23:23:01,AspiringNoodle,"Oh yeah, let's not forget that Ryzen supports ECC RAM :P"
25-05-2019T23:23:12,AspiringNoodle,Doesn't force you to buy server hardware to get that
25-05-2019T23:26:30,AspiringNoodle,"I mean, not really relevant for most people, even prosumers, but it's a nice feature to have ^^"
25-05-2019T23:26:46,Bgrmystr2,absolutely
25-05-2019T23:27:06,Bgrmystr2,my CPU is 4 core 4 thread so upgrading to a new ryzen chip would be so fucking mind-blowing
25-05-2019T23:27:29,AspiringNoodle,Don't skimp on the cooling if you want to overclock :D
25-05-2019T23:28:19,AspiringNoodle,One thing that's gonna drive me nuts is that there's relatively slim pickings when it comes to AIOs with RGB fans :/
25-05-2019T23:28:41,AspiringNoodle,"It's typically only the pump that's RGB.  And if the fans are also RGB, they tend to be ugly as sin."
25-05-2019T23:31:18,Bgrmystr2,"I've been running a Phenom II 955 since 2009, you really think I need to overclock? lol, I know how to get so much out of a CPU"
25-05-2019T23:40:16,AspiringNoodle,I should probably get to bed soon.
25-05-2019T23:40:39,AspiringNoodle,The eternal conflict.  A night owl who wants to get up earlier to get stuff done.  But still feels like staying up all night.
25-05-2019T23:40:55,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-sleepy:
25-05-2019T23:44:04,Bgrmystr2,I don't have that conflict
25-05-2019T23:44:07,Bgrmystr2,Fuck early.
25-05-2019T23:44:13,Bgrmystr2,I hate mornings.
25-05-2019T23:44:22,Bgrmystr2,I get up in the afternoon and still hate mornings.
25-05-2019T23:44:39,Ordithus,"You don't even know what morning is, how can you hate it"
25-05-2019T23:44:54,Bgrmystr2,trust me I know what morning is.
25-05-2019T23:45:08,Bgrmystr2,you think I got up early in the morning for school for years
25-05-2019T23:45:25,Bgrmystr2,my dad would come into my room and YELL me awake
25-05-2019T23:45:31,Bgrmystr2,to get me up for school
25-05-2019T23:45:52,Bgrmystr2,"needless to say, I couldn't get ready very well when my damn arms were spazzing due to that"
25-05-2019T23:45:57,Bgrmystr2,for years.
25-05-2019T23:46:15,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-eyeroll: sorry I made a joke sheesh
25-05-2019T23:46:21,Ordithus,Sounds lousy though
25-05-2019T23:46:45,Bgrmystr2,xD I was on time for my high school 10th grade year less than 10 times total
25-05-2019T23:46:48,Bgrmystr2,in the school year.
25-05-2019T23:47:16,Bgrmystr2,"I was late almost every day because I lived 45 mins away, parents had divorce, it was not a fun time"
25-05-2019T23:47:45,Bgrmystr2,then school kicked me out due to that
25-05-2019T23:47:56,Bgrmystr2,mornings can die.
25-05-2019T23:48:12,Bgrmystr2,"All day every day. Just afternoon, night, and sleep."
25-05-2019T23:49:10,Bgrmystr2,but no you right I wouldn't know mornings at all. I've never had a good one. Ever.
25-05-2019T23:49:15,Bgrmystr2,They all sucked.
25-05-2019T23:49:48,Bgrmystr2,I can't even properly function till an hour after I get outta bed. :/
25-05-2019T23:50:32,Bgrmystr2,"By the term ""not a morning person"" has a picture of my dumb face."
25-05-2019T23:50:39,Bgrmystr2,in the dictionary.
25-05-2019T23:50:46,Bgrmystr2,..maybe the thesaurus.
25-05-2019T23:50:54,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-keithdotdotdot: Dude I get it
25-05-2019T23:51:03,Bgrmystr2,No it's moar

25-05-2019T23:54:45,Bgrmystr2,do tell
25-05-2019T23:55:00,Ordithus,But I'm also a sleepy person
25-05-2019T23:55:07,Ordithus,And would rather sleep than rant
25-05-2019T23:55:44,Ordithus,"1 thing though: back in HS I worked at McD's.  I opened, 5 AM.  How did I live"

25-05-2019T23:57:21,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock:

25-05-2019T23:57:40,Bgrmystr2,and wake up to go to the store and close.. then go home
25-05-2019T23:57:52,Bgrmystr2,10/10 best job
25-05-2019T23:58:11,Ordithus,"Well it also paid about minimum wage, so"
25-05-2019T23:58:15,Ordithus,"No, not best job."
25-05-2019T23:59:17,Bgrmystr2,"well, no I mean like.. if one just had to go to the store to open it for other ppl, then go home to sleep.. just to wake up in time to close the store and then go home again"
25-05-2019T23:59:38,Bgrmystr2,that seems like the best job
