29-07-2019T00:07:31,Twokinds,Nah I had birthday cake
29-07-2019T00:07:31,Sclimshady,"Bacon is pig skin, pig skin is football, sports is healthy"

29-07-2019T00:08:39,Dadrobit,Me? At 175. That's the optimal weight for my body type.
29-07-2019T00:08:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôd like to see where you see these pounds besides the scale
29-07-2019T00:09:01,SpazztasticKiwi,then again I‚Äôm not exactly studying
29-07-2019T00:10:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôd try keto if I knew myself better than to forget I was on it
29-07-2019T00:10:51,SpazztasticKiwi,all things considered I want to say I‚Äôm ‚Äúok‚Äù with now - but I‚Äôm still walking

29-07-2019T00:19:04,Dadrobit,"Had a bit of experience before playing on my brother's rig, now I can embarrass myself in the comfort of my own home."
29-07-2019T00:19:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"I will say on my tan, it‚Äôs not terribly complete since there‚Äôs an x on my back from my shirt"
29-07-2019T00:19:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"‚Äúdance like no ones watching....or like you‚Äôve had a few drinks, whichever works‚Äù"
29-07-2019T00:20:58,Dadrobit,It is helping further my dream of one day becoming a kpop idol!
29-07-2019T00:21:02,Sclimshady,No amount of drinks can make me dance except for 2 step
29-07-2019T00:21:09,SpazztasticKiwi,you have to have talent for that
29-07-2019T00:21:42,Sclimshady,I want rice balls with your face on or its not real

29-07-2019T00:23:01,SpazztasticKiwi,never in all my life has it hit me to suddenly dance while doing my stuff at work or even in walmart in general
29-07-2019T00:23:38,SpazztasticKiwi,"I hum, but that‚Äôs to drown out the radio and keep myself semi sane"
29-07-2019T00:24:12,Sclimshady,"Don't get me wrong, i'll go hard in my car. but thats a private place"
29-07-2019T00:24:38,SpazztasticKiwi,there‚Äôs only so many times you can hear the songs on loop before you‚Äôre ready to beat a dj

29-07-2019T00:25:27,Sclimshady,Our employee door was right next to it and I wanted to smash the speakers
29-07-2019T00:25:38,SpazztasticKiwi,They‚Äôll pick like three or five songs and do nothing but play covers of it
29-07-2019T00:25:53,SpazztasticKiwi,"there‚Äôs only so many holy nights, people"
29-07-2019T00:26:13,SpazztasticKiwi,only so long until I‚Äôm ready to deck my own halls

29-07-2019T03:52:34,Bgrmystr2,yknow it's hard.. when someone dies.. that alone is bad enough
29-07-2019T03:52:42,Bgrmystr2,but they were married for 57 years
29-07-2019T03:53:04,Bgrmystr2,and one day she woke up next to him and he's gone.
29-07-2019T03:53:11,Bgrmystr2,I can't fucking imagine.

29-07-2019T10:05:18,SniperJackal,yup
29-07-2019T10:05:32,BadFoMo,Same.
29-07-2019T10:05:56,CrimsonQuill,Hullo BadFoMo.
29-07-2019T10:06:02,SniperJackal,I like how the main human characters look childish compared to the ones in the recent sketch
29-07-2019T10:06:26,BadFoMo,I think I'll take lore over pinups anyday.
29-07-2019T10:06:29,CrimsonQuill,In the picture?
29-07-2019T10:06:33,SniperJackal,yep
29-07-2019T10:06:35,CrimsonQuill,The Exploration one?
29-07-2019T10:06:38,SniperJackal,yes
29-07-2019T10:06:53,CrimsonQuill,"They do seem like curious children...But then again, it's a new world."
29-07-2019T10:06:57,CrimsonQuill,A new land.
29-07-2019T10:07:44,SniperJackal,Sometimes I feel like im the only one wanting too se more human characters in sketches hahah
29-07-2019T10:07:48,SniperJackal,because variety
29-07-2019T10:08:43,CrimsonQuill,"It would be fun to see more human culture, how it contrasts with that of the Keidran and the Basitins."
29-07-2019T10:09:03,CrimsonQuill,"For example, the heirarchies and governments."
29-07-2019T10:09:15,SniperJackal,agreed
29-07-2019T10:09:28,CrimsonQuill,Militaries and Services....Clothing....
29-07-2019T10:09:39,CrimsonQuill,Housing and settlements.
29-07-2019T10:09:42,CrimsonQuill,All these things.
29-07-2019T10:10:23,SniperJackal,yep but its probably better for these things to be in sketches
29-07-2019T10:10:35,SniperJackal,the main story line should stay as it is
29-07-2019T10:11:39,CrimsonQuill,I personally hope that the story still has a lot ahead....
29-07-2019T10:11:51,SniperJackal,same
29-07-2019T10:11:52,CrimsonQuill,"Because I'm only recently in it, and I love it so much."
29-07-2019T10:12:10,SniperJackal,I read the story about a year ago for the first time
29-07-2019T10:12:14,SniperJackal,read it in 2 days
29-07-2019T10:12:21,SniperJackal,I was an emotional wreck
29-07-2019T10:12:33,SniperJackal,never gonna do that again
29-07-2019T10:12:36,CrimsonQuill,I'm reading it again for the third or fourth time this year.
29-07-2019T10:12:59,SniperJackal,gawd
29-07-2019T10:13:08,SniperJackal,I tried rereading it but I just cant
29-07-2019T10:13:13,CrimsonQuill,The first time I ever read it I read a few chapters a day...until Chapter 10. Then I couldn't leave it and read chapters 10-19 in an afternoon.
29-07-2019T10:13:22,SniperJackal,usually I just reread the chapters that I want
29-07-2019T10:13:24,CrimsonQuill,I admit though...the old chapters are a bit to go through.
29-07-2019T10:13:29,SniperJackal,yep
29-07-2019T10:13:30,CrimsonQuill,What with the art evolution.
29-07-2019T10:13:32,SniperJackal,*blarg*
29-07-2019T10:13:36,CrimsonQuill,And the dialogue.
29-07-2019T10:13:39,CrimsonQuill,But it's worth it.
29-07-2019T10:13:58,SniperJackal,when I first read it the Laura death actually legit made me sad
29-07-2019T10:14:17,CrimsonQuill,I think the hardest thing is the voicing in my head...because it can be harder to think of them in the head when the appearences aren't finalized.
29-07-2019T10:14:34,SniperJackal,yeah
29-07-2019T10:14:51,CrimsonQuill,"The moment when Flora tells Trace she's pregnant, and when Red almost killed Raine really got me."
29-07-2019T10:15:05,CrimsonQuill,And Keith's illusion thing...
29-07-2019T10:15:10,SniperJackal,oh yeah
29-07-2019T10:15:18,SniperJackal,when Laura possesed the ghost
29-07-2019T10:15:24,SniperJackal,that hit hard
29-07-2019T10:15:57,CrimsonQuill,Laura never possessed the ghost-it was just the work of the illusion.
29-07-2019T10:16:17,SniperJackal,but at the end you can see its actually her
29-07-2019T10:16:29,CrimsonQuill,Not quite
29-07-2019T10:16:33,SniperJackal,its confusing
29-07-2019T10:16:43,CrimsonQuill,As much as the illusion could feel...she hoped he'd be alright.
29-07-2019T10:16:58,SniperJackal,"anyways so far I ve reread chapter 17,18,19 the most"
29-07-2019T10:16:58,CrimsonQuill,It tugged the heart.
29-07-2019T10:17:30,CrimsonQuill,But especially hard is when Evil Black Smoke Hallucination tries the 'corruption' of the mind...
29-07-2019T10:17:38,CrimsonQuill,And it hits that verbal last straw...
29-07-2019T10:17:44,SniperJackal,oh yeah when he yells at flora
29-07-2019T10:18:07,CrimsonQuill,That moment truly marks the point where he actively fights his darknes...
29-07-2019T10:18:11,CrimsonQuill,darkness
29-07-2019T10:18:36,SniperJackal,the funniest moment has got to be when maddie slept under trace and flora s bed
29-07-2019T10:18:46,SniperJackal,that got a giggle out of me
29-07-2019T10:18:50,CrimsonQuill,But I see a lot of similarities between both Trace and Keith...and a certain Director from Red vs Blue...
29-07-2019T10:19:13,CrimsonQuill,"If you haven't watched RvB I won't elaborate, but the parallels struck me."
29-07-2019T10:19:30,SniperJackal,too many patterns
29-07-2019T10:19:43,SniperJackal,but trace and keith are so different tho
29-07-2019T10:19:46,CrimsonQuill,So...have you watched RvB?
29-07-2019T10:19:51,SniperJackal,uhm
29-07-2019T10:19:58,CrimsonQuill,I'll take that as a no.
29-07-2019T10:20:10,SniperJackal,Look Il do it sometime
29-07-2019T10:20:14,CrimsonQuill,I can't explain the parallels without heavy spoilers...
29-07-2019T10:20:21,CrimsonQuill,But it's worth a watch.
29-07-2019T10:20:32,CrimsonQuill,Seasons 6-10 and 11-13 are the best.
29-07-2019T10:20:41,CrimsonQuill,But Seasons 1-5 are hilarious...
29-07-2019T10:20:48,SniperJackal,the halo 1 days
29-07-2019T10:20:55,SniperJackal,why are we here
29-07-2019T10:21:08,CrimsonQuill,"One of life's great mysteries, isn't it?"
29-07-2019T10:21:21,SniperJackal,I do remember that tho
29-07-2019T10:22:20,CrimsonQuill,Good times...
29-07-2019T10:30:42,SniperJackal,"anyways just like with twokinds, its the same with the halo universe. The main story line is great, and everything extra is just a bonus"
29-07-2019T10:33:17,CrimsonQuill,True that
29-07-2019T10:33:20,CrimsonQuill,Welll....
29-07-2019T10:33:30,CrimsonQuill,'Always'....Halo 5 was not so good.
29-07-2019T10:33:41,CrimsonQuill,I think we can agree that it was a dark chapter
29-07-2019T10:33:47,SniperJackal,100%
29-07-2019T10:33:52,SniperJackal,halo 5 was shallow
29-07-2019T10:35:35,SniperJackal,they shouldnt have brought cortana back
29-07-2019T10:35:48,SniperJackal,it should have been over on halo 4
29-07-2019T10:36:08,SniperJackal,sometimes you gotta let certain things go
29-07-2019T10:44:30,CrimsonQuill,Indeed.
29-07-2019T10:44:40,CrimsonQuill,I'm going to head off for a while.
29-07-2019T10:44:43,CrimsonQuill,I might be back.
29-07-2019T10:44:46,CrimsonQuill,Cheerio.
29-07-2019T10:47:41,AspiringNoodle,"I've watched the first few seasons of RvB, I can confirm that they are indeed hilarious"
29-07-2019T10:48:02,SniperJackal,ok bye
29-07-2019T10:48:11,AspiringNoodle,"That said, as the series progresses, it gets more heavily involved with storytelling and then eventually custom animations"
29-07-2019T10:48:20,AspiringNoodle,Also bye~

29-07-2019T11:32:40,AspiringNoodle,"So this ram I'm waiting for, they said it should be up for sale by the end of the mont"
29-07-2019T11:32:46,AspiringNoodle,And that's from company representatives
29-07-2019T11:33:27,AspiringNoodle,"Would be nice if it went up for sale today, seeing how the RAM market is basically wiped out"
29-07-2019T11:54:23,Orthonox,Is RAM still stupid expensive?
29-07-2019T11:59:38,Orthonox,Checked: It is not anymore.
29-07-2019T12:00:04,AspiringNoodle,The premium stuff is
29-07-2019T12:01:04,Orthonox,Premium is always going to be expensive. How much is the RAM you are trying to get?
29-07-2019T12:01:56,AspiringNoodle,The ram I'm looking at runs $340 - $420 per 32GB total
29-07-2019T12:02:20,AspiringNoodle,And 1/3 - 1/2 the entires are sometimes $300 or more for just 16GB
29-07-2019T12:02:59,Orthonox,What are you going to do that requires expensive RAM?
29-07-2019T12:03:10,AspiringNoodle,Use a Ryzen processor :P
29-07-2019T12:04:01,Orthonox,"I'm not familiar with everything on Ryzen. I'm assuming the RAM you are buying is at a very high speed and probably low CAS latency, right?"
29-07-2019T12:04:08,AspiringNoodle,Yup
29-07-2019T12:04:14,AspiringNoodle,I'm trying to get my hands on 3600 CL16
29-07-2019T12:04:19,Orthonox,How does that benefit Ryzen?
29-07-2019T12:04:50,AspiringNoodle,Ryzen has always benefitted from higher performance ram since the first gen
29-07-2019T12:05:09,AspiringNoodle,The infinity fabric interconnect really likes ram that hauls ass :3
29-07-2019T12:06:07,AspiringNoodle,Bumping up from the most basic of 2133 ram kits to the highest end is the equivalent performance boost of a modest overclock
29-07-2019T12:06:34,AspiringNoodle,I'm gonna pull some numbers out of my ass from a benchmark video I watched a day or two ago
29-07-2019T12:07:01,AspiringNoodle,"A Ryzen 3900x running on the cheapest, entry level 2133 ram, would achieve 98 fps in a given title"
29-07-2019T12:07:05,Orthonox,"Aw cool. I remember before Ryzen came to be, RAM Speed wasn't important unless you have an APU or want to overclock for fun."
29-07-2019T12:07:13,AspiringNoodle,"Bump that up to 3600 CL16, and the FPS jumps up to 117"
29-07-2019T12:07:50,Orthonox,Alright AMD. I see you. First making cores important and now RAM speed.
29-07-2019T12:07:51,AspiringNoodle,"And when it comes to 1% lows, even comparing 3600 CL16 to 3200 CL14, the difference an be as high as 20 fps"
29-07-2019T12:08:20,AspiringNoodle,"Also, if you like playing large open-world games, you'll want better ram"
29-07-2019T12:08:34,AspiringNoodle,"Fallout 4 is a good example, with your ram quality having a noticeable effect on framerate"
29-07-2019T12:09:16,AspiringNoodle,"However, I wouldn't recommend buying 3600 CL16 unless you REALLY want to squeeze out every last drop of performance and don't care about the cost"
29-07-2019T12:09:33,AspiringNoodle,"After 3000 CL16, there seems to be serious diminishing returns"
29-07-2019T12:11:27,Orthonox,I would imagine diminishing returns would exist but thank you for the info. Crazy how computer hardware changes after a few years.
29-07-2019T12:11:57,AspiringNoodle,"I think Intel also sees gains with higher ram performance, but we're talking single digit percentages in improvement"
29-07-2019T12:12:27,AspiringNoodle,"However, if they're forced to go with chiplet design like AMD to improve yields, that might change super quick"
29-07-2019T12:13:35,Orthonox,I'm just happy there is competition now with AMD going from the underdog to the king. Shows that Intel really has not been innovating for the past many years.
29-07-2019T12:14:00,AspiringNoodle,"I looked into that, there are 3 reasons they are struggling atm"
29-07-2019T12:14:40,AspiringNoodle,1) Their monolith chip design is biting them in the ass.  Turns out that the I/O section of processors really doesn't like die shrinkage
29-07-2019T12:14:56,AspiringNoodle,"It's why AMD's processors have a 14 nm I/O die, and the actual processors are 7nm"
29-07-2019T12:15:27,AspiringNoodle,2) In-house fabrication.  They are able to pack more transistors into their processors than any other manufacturer.
29-07-2019T12:16:07,AspiringNoodle,That's part of the reason they perform so well in single-thread workloads at 14nm
29-07-2019T12:16:20,AspiringNoodle,3) Both of the above.
29-07-2019T12:16:54,AspiringNoodle,"Specifically, the monolith design reduces yields, because they design the whole processor and produce it all at once"
29-07-2019T12:17:17,AspiringNoodle,"By breaking the chip up into smaller, separate dies, AMD can easily bin multiple parts to create a single processor"
29-07-2019T12:17:56,AspiringNoodle,And the transistor count is a case of Intel being a victim of their own success
29-07-2019T12:18:24,AspiringNoodle,"They've refined their 14nm processors so much, that it might take 2 generations of 10nm processors to match the performance"
29-07-2019T12:19:35,AspiringNoodle,We don't know when they'll finally release their 10nm processors for desktop.  But at this point Intel needs to put out something that's even more powerful than their 14nm++[+] processors
29-07-2019T12:20:11,AspiringNoodle,"And if [when] Intel is forced to go to a chiplet design, there's no telling how that will affect the performance of their processors."
29-07-2019T12:20:22,AspiringNoodle,"They could be just as powerful, or they could take serious performance hits."
29-07-2019T12:20:27,AspiringNoodle,#EndLesson
29-07-2019T12:24:51,Orthonox,Are you saying is that Intel needs a new CPU architecture to compete with AMD?
29-07-2019T12:25:13,AspiringNoodle,Yes
29-07-2019T12:25:29,AspiringNoodle,They've been working on 10nm for YEARS.  It's why they're still putting out 14nm++++++++++++++++++++++++ processors
29-07-2019T12:26:09,AspiringNoodle,"If they don't bite the bullet and do something, by the time they finally release 10nm desktop processors, AMD could be on Zen 3 or 4"
29-07-2019T12:26:35,AspiringNoodle,"At which point that ""amazing performance"" will become moot :|"
29-07-2019T12:27:07,Orthonox,Okay because that is what AMD did when the Bulldozer-based architecture wasn't working for them.
29-07-2019T12:27:58,AspiringNoodle,"Except when AMD was working on Ryzen, they kinda went silent"
29-07-2019T12:28:07,AspiringNoodle,Intel won't shut the hell up about their 10nm
29-07-2019T12:28:40,AspiringNoodle,"So the moment Intel either stops talking about that, or starts talking about something else, THEN they might finally be innovating :3"
29-07-2019T12:31:43,AspiringNoodle,You looking to build a new computer?
29-07-2019T12:31:46,Orthonox,You still gotta act like you are the top dog when you have the highest market share.
29-07-2019T12:31:50,Orthonox,Not yet.
29-07-2019T12:32:09,Orthonox,My PC is still going strong.
29-07-2019T12:32:28,Orthonox,I'll upgrade when the new consoles come out.
29-07-2019T12:33:07,AspiringNoodle,I wonder if they'll actually be able to compete with higher end PC hardware ;P
29-07-2019T12:33:34,AspiringNoodle,Someone actually posted a graph somewhere showing console power relative to PC power.  There was roughly one one point in time where a console was more powerful
29-07-2019T12:34:20,AspiringNoodle,"Correction, two points"
29-07-2019T12:34:37,AspiringNoodle,Graph of console vs pc compute power: http://i.imgur.com/49wLXFP.jpg
29-07-2019T12:34:51,Orthonox,"Before this generation, it used to be that when a new console comes out, it would perform just as well if not better than high-end PCs at launch."
29-07-2019T12:37:38,Orthonox,There is some problems with this graph you linked. First question: Who made this graph?
29-07-2019T12:38:14,AspiringNoodle,Let me see if I can find it
29-07-2019T12:40:09,AspiringNoodle,There's a better one
29-07-2019T12:40:14,AspiringNoodle,It shows console teraflops over time
29-07-2019T12:42:44,AspiringNoodle,Which console claimed its performance would be better than a 1080?
29-07-2019T12:43:45,Orthonox,That's a much better graph than the previous one.
29-07-2019T12:45:56,AspiringNoodle,"Alright, so the 1080 is at about 8.9 TFLOPs of performance"
29-07-2019T12:47:33,AspiringNoodle,2060 Super: 7.18
29-07-2019T12:47:55,AspiringNoodle,2070 Super: 9.06
29-07-2019T12:48:22,AspiringNoodle,2080 Super: 11.15
29-07-2019T12:48:48,TeapotOfDoom,Tflops is a horrible metric
29-07-2019T12:48:49,AspiringNoodle,I'll be interested to see where the new consoles land :D
29-07-2019T12:49:07,AspiringNoodle,And it's the only way we can compare the power in consoles :/
29-07-2019T12:49:14,TeapotOfDoom,Nobody in their right mind does compute stuff at home
29-07-2019T12:49:40,TeapotOfDoom,Except people who do neuronal networks for fun
29-07-2019T12:49:42,AspiringNoodle,"Again, it's the only way we can realistically measure the horsepower in consoles over time"
29-07-2019T12:49:55,TeapotOfDoom,Who still do not count as in their right mind imo xD
29-07-2019T12:50:26,TeapotOfDoom,I would not call it realistic but i get where you're going
29-07-2019T12:50:53,TeapotOfDoom,Is there really no geekbench or something? I mean there is one for phones
29-07-2019T12:51:10,AspiringNoodle,Just gotta deal with it
29-07-2019T12:51:32,AspiringNoodle,"I've put the numbers out there, now it's a case of wait and see"
29-07-2019T12:51:57,Orthonox,I was going to tell him that. There are many other factors that go into the overall gaming performance. I understand it is relative but not something I would depend on.
29-07-2019T12:52:27,AspiringNoodle,"Well, it's not like you're going to get a fair comparison any other way"
29-07-2019T12:52:28,TeapotOfDoom,Explaination why i said that for anyone who is not is computer science: you can have two systems with the same tflops who do completely different in another task
29-07-2019T12:52:41,AspiringNoodle,PC games have editable graphics settings
29-07-2019T12:53:49,TeapotOfDoom,"Also console versions are mastered with the hardware in mind. So ""maxing out"" means something different than on pcs. Depending on the game you can clearly see a difference"
29-07-2019T12:54:18,TeapotOfDoom,Do consoles have graphic settings?
29-07-2019T12:54:20,AspiringNoodle,"Yup, the comparison is so apples to oranges, that tflops is the only real way we can measure differences"
29-07-2019T12:54:22,AspiringNoodle,HELL no
29-07-2019T12:54:39,AspiringNoodle,"Graphics will depend on platform, and they're preset by the developers"
29-07-2019T12:54:59,TeapotOfDoom,Even then it's like comparing apples to oranges using their color
29-07-2019T12:55:18,AspiringNoodle,Gflops is the ONLY standard measurement we can really get
29-07-2019T12:55:45,AspiringNoodle,Because a playstation game will be optimized differently than an xbox game than a pc game
29-07-2019T12:56:11,AspiringNoodle,Games are optimized to hit a certain FPS range at a given resolution
29-07-2019T12:56:39,TeapotOfDoom,Yep
29-07-2019T12:57:10,TeapotOfDoom,Which would kinda make it more useful again thinking about it
29-07-2019T12:57:20,AspiringNoodle,"So when next gen consoles claim to be ""more powerful than a 1080"", the only real way we can feasibly check that is, ""How many tflops are the new consoles pulling?"""
29-07-2019T12:57:35,Orthonox,I rather compare the performance of a PC and Console by the games tested.
29-07-2019T12:57:37,TeapotOfDoom,More tflops would mean better quality instead of more performance
29-07-2019T12:58:21,TeapotOfDoom,You would be right but just comparing the fps will not yield any useful result
29-07-2019T12:58:22,AspiringNoodle,Long story short: I don't really buy into the marketing hype bs
29-07-2019T12:59:05,TeapotOfDoom,"As noodle said, they are optimised to run a target fps. What suffers is quality"
29-07-2019T12:59:31,AspiringNoodle,And quality is super subjective
29-07-2019T12:59:49,TeapotOfDoom,Would not say that
29-07-2019T13:00:03,TeapotOfDoom,It's mostly graphics quality
29-07-2019T13:00:14,AspiringNoodle,"Unless you can get a console running a pc version or a pc running a console version, you won't get a good comparison of performance"
29-07-2019T13:00:18,TeapotOfDoom,So it's just practically impossible to measure
29-07-2019T13:00:34,AspiringNoodle,"Again, graphics quality is mostly subjective"
29-07-2019T13:01:12,AspiringNoodle,Rainbow Six Siege has a nice comparison of AA / postprocessing combos on a website with slider images
29-07-2019T13:01:48,TeapotOfDoom,"I'm talkin more about a ""just crank everything and see what fps it still reaches scenario"""
29-07-2019T13:01:50,AspiringNoodle,And one could argue that some of the less intensive combinations look as good as the most expensive combo
29-07-2019T13:01:57,Orthonox,"Tangent note: When the PS4/Xbox One came out in 2013, their performance was comparable to that of an underclocked GTX 580, a GPU from 2010."
29-07-2019T13:02:25,AspiringNoodle,"Key word being underclocked, lmao"
29-07-2019T13:02:42,TeapotOfDoom,They use integrated amd solutions. What did you expect at the time
29-07-2019T13:05:09,Orthonox,I wasn't expecting much. Some people who don't understand computer hardware thought differently. Most PS4/Xbox One games were somewhat more prettier versions of old games. The jump between the generations wasn't big whatsoever.
29-07-2019T13:05:53,Orthonox,The point is that the consoles that came were not even close to mid-high range PCs at the time.
29-07-2019T13:07:47,TeapotOfDoom,I  dont think they neccessarily should or will be
29-07-2019T13:08:04,TeapotOfDoom,Compare the price of a console to a mid range pc
29-07-2019T13:10:14,TeapotOfDoom,It's about 300‚Ç¨ so you kinda get what you can expect
29-07-2019T13:12:15,Orthonox,"I remember around that time I saw many ""Kill Your Console"" PC builds that had similar prices to the consoles but performed better."
29-07-2019T13:12:15,Orthonox,"Anyway, I'm about to bounce and do some work."
29-07-2019T13:12:32,AspiringNoodle,Oh boy
29-07-2019T13:12:40,AspiringNoodle,ROG STRIX 2080 supers are available now
29-07-2019T13:12:47,AspiringNoodle,"Will I have the willpower to wait for the aorus, lol"
29-07-2019T13:13:27,TeapotOfDoom,Strix is a well binned card
29-07-2019T13:13:42,AspiringNoodle,ASUS has been a giant douchenozzle recently
29-07-2019T13:13:55,TeapotOfDoom,To wait or not to wait that's the question
29-07-2019T13:14:05,AspiringNoodle,"And I want to pair the GPU with the motherboard for aesthetic reasons, and apparently ASUS might not be doing QC on their mobos :/"
29-07-2019T13:14:06,TeapotOfDoom,Man i love this word so much xD
29-07-2019T13:14:13,TeapotOfDoom,Why so?

29-07-2019T13:14:30,TeapotOfDoom,Really?
29-07-2019T13:14:37,AspiringNoodle,Read the bad reviews
29-07-2019T13:15:30,AspiringNoodle,And compare the number of reviews / rating with this: https://www.newegg.com/p/N82E16813145155?Description=x570&cm_re=x570-_-13-145-155-_-Product
29-07-2019T13:15:56,TeapotOfDoom,Lol wut
29-07-2019T13:17:30,TeapotOfDoom,Asus has been the most reliable mobo choice yet
29-07-2019T13:17:47,AspiringNoodle,I've also heard their RMA is hell :P
29-07-2019T13:17:47,TeapotOfDoom,Weird
29-07-2019T13:18:10,TeapotOfDoom,I only know someone who worked at gigabyte
29-07-2019T13:18:23,TeapotOfDoom,So i can't confirm nor deny
29-07-2019T13:19:11,AspiringNoodle,And I know ASUS is the golden standard for GPUs
29-07-2019T13:19:16,TeapotOfDoom,Also just noticed i signed of about five minutes before the stream began yesterday... damn
29-07-2019T13:19:21,AspiringNoodle,"Best performance, quiet, super cool"
29-07-2019T13:19:29,AspiringNoodle,I know how you feel xD
29-07-2019T13:19:34,TeapotOfDoom,Strix is a ziest of a card
29-07-2019T13:19:35,AspiringNoodle,It started like 15 minutes after I left for the movie
29-07-2019T13:19:38,TeapotOfDoom,*biest

29-07-2019T13:19:55,AspiringNoodle,:P
29-07-2019T13:20:01,TeapotOfDoom,That's some bad timing for both of us lol
29-07-2019T13:20:17,AspiringNoodle,"AT least I got to catch the last 2, and saw the finished Adira / Maeve picture"
29-07-2019T13:20:25,TeapotOfDoom,Oh i used the german spelling fail
29-07-2019T13:20:31,AspiringNoodle,"Wish I was there, though.  I always wanted to see Tom do a forest background"
29-07-2019T13:21:00,AspiringNoodle,"And nvm, looked it up xD"
29-07-2019T13:21:16,TeapotOfDoom,You still saw THE END of the adira one? How much time did he spend on that wow
29-07-2019T13:22:05,TeapotOfDoom,Strix ist ein Biest von einer Karte
29-07-2019T13:22:22,TeapotOfDoom,Translating the rest to german works as well lol
29-07-2019T13:30:40,AspiringNoodle,"Man... if Trident Z Neo was available, this would be perfect..."
29-07-2019T14:00:24,SpazztasticKiwi,isn‚Äôt it a think now that critics don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre doin even though it‚Äôs their job
29-07-2019T14:00:28,SpazztasticKiwi,thing
29-07-2019T14:01:50,SpazztasticKiwi,"I‚Äôve seen many people cover especially with movie critics now, that don‚Äôt end up lining at all with what the real world audience ends up saying"
29-07-2019T14:04:52,AspiringNoodle,There's a huge disparity between audiences and critics
29-07-2019T14:04:59,AspiringNoodle,Audiences more or less care if they were entertained
29-07-2019T14:05:36,AspiringNoodle,"Although, it does seem like critics are starting to do reviews with political ends in mind :\"
29-07-2019T14:11:27,AspiringNoodle,Okay... it seems like I might as well just pick a brand and buy it xD
29-07-2019T14:11:41,AspiringNoodle,"You go online, and you can literally play a game of ""Who had the worst RMA experience with what company."""
29-07-2019T14:35:10,AspiringNoodle,Holy.  Didn't take long for the ASUS card to sell out

29-07-2019T14:46:17,AspiringNoodle,I've learned that the internet makes things meaningless
29-07-2019T14:46:21,CrimsonQuill,How so?
29-07-2019T14:46:39,AspiringNoodle,"So, I've read that ASUS has notoriously horrible customer service"
29-07-2019T14:46:51,CrimsonQuill,ok...
29-07-2019T14:46:53,AspiringNoodle,And then I find threads with just as many horrible stories about other companies
29-07-2019T14:47:08,CrimsonQuill,Oh.
29-07-2019T14:47:09,AspiringNoodle,"And it's like... everything is relative, nothing is meaningful"
29-07-2019T14:47:21,CrimsonQuill,"So, all the same experiences."
29-07-2019T14:47:22,AspiringNoodle,Might as well just pick a company because you're rolling the dice anyways
29-07-2019T14:47:33,CrimsonQuill,Depressing.
29-07-2019T14:47:36,AspiringNoodle,Yup
29-07-2019T14:47:49,AspiringNoodle,"You'll find glowing, speedy RMA stories"

29-07-2019T16:15:57,AspiringNoodle,"As a result, they are more or less multitasking constantly"
29-07-2019T16:16:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Robin & lyxian have the sass only year long editors do
29-07-2019T16:16:07,AspiringNoodle,Makes it much easier to miss what they need to do :/

29-07-2019T16:18:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Lixian likes to poke at Mark with sound effects
29-07-2019T16:18:36,TeapotOfDoom,it was so obvious and stupid yet still funny
29-07-2019T16:18:43,SpazztasticKiwi,like the dial up noise when he‚Äôs thinking
29-07-2019T16:18:47,TeapotOfDoom,lol
29-07-2019T16:19:07,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs even funnier cause it matches right up with his age
29-07-2019T16:19:17,TeapotOfDoom,the BIRDS! video was so incredably stupid fun
29-07-2019T16:20:00,TeapotOfDoom,iiieeeeiiieeieeeezzzzzzztskkrrrrrrrrrr

29-07-2019T16:23:01,TeapotOfDoom,wait it stole the entire bread?
29-07-2019T16:23:13,TeapotOfDoom,or are you reffering to a mark vid?
29-07-2019T16:23:42,SpazztasticKiwi,the park
29-07-2019T16:26:12,SpazztasticKiwi,you remember the pretzel video where Ethan thought Amy was gonna kill mark

29-07-2019T16:29:05,AspiringNoodle,I find him amusing :P

29-07-2019T16:29:35,AspiringNoodle,There's a horror game at teh beginning where the game got revenge for all other games where let's players talk over in-game dialogue
29-07-2019T16:30:01,TeapotOfDoom,i know some mechanical engineers
29-07-2019T16:30:02,AspiringNoodle,It had dialogue that was too loud to talk over :3
29-07-2019T16:31:07,TeapotOfDoom,they torture you with that stuff at uni until you can't think of anything else in real life other then mechanice
29-07-2019T16:34:26,AspiringNoodle,"I found a valid excuse to NOT buy an ASUS motherboard, lol"
29-07-2019T16:34:42,AspiringNoodle,Potentially valid*
29-07-2019T16:35:00,AspiringNoodle,There's a cover for the chipset fan that potentially intrudes upon an m.2 slot
29-07-2019T16:35:18,AspiringNoodle,And I'm not sure if integrated heatspreaders on motherboards are gonna be enough to cool the new gen 4 stuff :c
29-07-2019T16:36:02,AspiringNoodle,https://www.newegg.com/asus-rog-crosshair-viii-hero/p/N82E16813119109?Item=N82E16813119109

29-07-2019T16:36:21,AspiringNoodle,I don't think you'd be able to put a gen 4 drive with a heatsink there
29-07-2019T16:36:28,AspiringNoodle,Engineering fail?

29-07-2019T16:44:56,AspiringNoodle,RIP everyone involved
29-07-2019T16:45:30,SpazztasticKiwi,if you hear ‚Äúduck‚Äù...
29-07-2019T16:45:42,SpazztasticKiwi,become one with the floor
29-07-2019T16:46:58,TeapotOfDoom,lol
29-07-2019T16:47:11,TeapotOfDoom,get down quick in that case
29-07-2019T16:48:34,TeapotOfDoom,right above the top pci slot noodle?
29-07-2019T16:48:41,SpazztasticKiwi,all these two for ones foods and only one me
29-07-2019T16:48:42,AspiringNoodle,Yup
29-07-2019T16:49:19,TeapotOfDoom,i'm pretty sure that headspreader is a) removable and b) used to cool the drive as well
29-07-2019T16:49:43,AspiringNoodle,"In that case: https://www.guru3d.com/articles_pages/corsair_mp600_pcie_4_nvme_ssd_review,6.html"
29-07-2019T16:50:00,AspiringNoodle,Looks like the included heatspreaders on x570 boards might be enough
29-07-2019T16:50:08,AspiringNoodle,The one they tested peaked at 55c
29-07-2019T16:51:24,TeapotOfDoom,i'm still impressed that we reached the point where you have enough data throuput on the controller to cook it
29-07-2019T16:52:08,TeapotOfDoom,you're workday already over spazz?
29-07-2019T16:52:25,AspiringNoodle,Huh... neat.  Looks like the reviewers were using an ASUS board
29-07-2019T16:52:37,AspiringNoodle,Shame they used the bottom (larger) m.2 slot
29-07-2019T16:52:44,AspiringNoodle,I'm curious as to what the temperatures would be in the top slot.
29-07-2019T16:56:03,TeapotOfDoom,well something else to think about: does the top slot infringe on the bandwidth of the pci slot right below it
29-07-2019T16:56:29,AspiringNoodle,I'm more concerned about ASUS's design choices :P
29-07-2019T16:56:52,AspiringNoodle,"For example, it seems like the cover for the top slot requires you to remove the fan cover as well"
29-07-2019T16:56:54,SpazztasticKiwi,you know those double tired trucks with the wide wells
29-07-2019T16:57:05,AspiringNoodle,I hate those.  They look stupid af
29-07-2019T16:57:14,SpazztasticKiwi,dude I been chatting with said it made the trucks look like they got hips
29-07-2019T16:57:24,AspiringNoodle,...:ptv-snicker:
29-07-2019T16:57:35,SpazztasticKiwi,did...did he give a truck a booty
29-07-2019T16:57:51,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-condescending: do I hear jealousy of dem curves? :V
29-07-2019T16:58:03,SpazztasticKiwi,please
29-07-2019T16:58:09,Bgrmystr2,haha
29-07-2019T16:58:12,SpazztasticKiwi,I got better curses than some truck
29-07-2019T16:58:16,SpazztasticKiwi,curves
29-07-2019T16:58:35,TeapotOfDoom,lol
29-07-2019T16:58:48,TeapotOfDoom,truck's got the booty
29-07-2019T16:58:54,SpazztasticKiwi,besides half the things that come out of his mouth makes me wonder if he thinks before he talks
29-07-2019T16:59:05,Bgrmystr2,"in their defense, the extra tire is supposed to lead to extra weight it can hold in the bed"
29-07-2019T16:59:15,TeapotOfDoom,he's basically scarlet
29-07-2019T16:59:16,Bgrmystr2,from what I know
29-07-2019T16:59:41,SpazztasticKiwi,all I know it makes me look fat
29-07-2019T16:59:43,SpazztasticKiwi,em
29-07-2019T17:00:47,AspiringNoodle,"Look at the time, I gotta head out for dinner"
29-07-2019T17:00:56,TeapotOfDoom,i have never seen trucks even remotely that size somewhere else then america
29-07-2019T17:01:13,TeapotOfDoom,look at the time i should be fast asleep
29-07-2019T17:01:21,TeapotOfDoom,yet we both are not ^^
29-07-2019T17:01:52,Bgrmystr2,"America has wide roads and is designed for much larger vehicles. we also have a much larger road structure than other countries, the lanes are wider and vehicles are larger."
29-07-2019T17:02:15,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôll say I‚Äôve gathered he‚Äôs a leg guy if that‚Äôs what he sees in a vehicle
29-07-2019T17:02:53,AspiringNoodle,Be back later :3
29-07-2019T17:03:41,TeapotOfDoom,later noodle!
29-07-2019T17:04:05,TeapotOfDoom,i was over there more then once by now. last time i went there a few years ago a friend of mine (who is not particullary big) was with me and first thing she sees when she gets out of the car is a huge truck
29-07-2019T17:04:24,TeapotOfDoom,the hight of the hood was about her size
29-07-2019T17:04:51,Bgrmystr2,was it a semi or something...?
29-07-2019T17:05:22,TeapotOfDoom,and she's like what the hell is this?? the car dwarfed her lol
29-07-2019T17:05:31,TeapotOfDoom,nope just a really big pickup truck
29-07-2019T17:05:46,TeapotOfDoom,i knew that cars like this existed by then
29-07-2019T17:05:54,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm wanting a coffe
29-07-2019T17:06:09,TeapotOfDoom,i think it was a gmc or ford i dunno. was a few years back
29-07-2019T17:06:29,Bgrmystr2,those definitely do exist. Most the time the really big ones seem big because they have massive tires and the suspension system is designed for rough terrain
29-07-2019T17:06:30,TeapotOfDoom,sounds nice.... i need water atm
29-07-2019T17:06:37,SpazztasticKiwi,you know a semi when you see it
29-07-2019T17:07:06,Bgrmystr2,"if the cab itself is big, usually that's due to more room in the interior or whatnot"
29-07-2019T17:07:21,Bgrmystr2,usually you have big beds in the back as well designed to haul heavy loads
29-07-2019T17:08:04,Bgrmystr2,"good for cross-state stuff, since that's comparably far compared to most other countries."
29-07-2019T17:08:36,TeapotOfDoom,funny thing is your trucks have snoots yet ours have not
29-07-2019T17:08:39,Bgrmystr2,good for pulling weight too if needbe :thinking:
29-07-2019T17:09:55,Bgrmystr2,gonna head out to the store
29-07-2019T17:09:58,Bgrmystr2,be back later :i
29-07-2019T17:10:09,Bgrmystr2,:U* sometimes my fingers can't keyboard
29-07-2019T17:10:11,TeapotOfDoom,bye bgr
29-07-2019T17:10:38,TeapotOfDoom,if i succeeded in my latest experiment i will head to bed too. lets see
29-07-2019T17:15:10,TeapotOfDoom,i did. time for me to head off too. night y'all!
29-07-2019T17:15:25,TeapotOfDoom,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
29-07-2019T17:25:32,SpazztasticKiwi,‚Äúfive cups of green tea a day can help you lose weight‚Äù I‚Äôm sure it can but I can drink 5 packets with only 1-4 cups of water
29-07-2019T17:25:57,SpazztasticKiwi,"so what do you consider a cup, article"
29-07-2019T17:30:07,SpazztasticKiwi,I waved when I left McDonald‚Äôs with my drink and half of em looked confused but they waved back
29-07-2019T17:45:11,FloofyCat,"Kiwi, websites that say ""five cups of green tea a day can help you lose weight"" and stuff are only saying that because it is technically correct only if you drink that and on the side starve yourself"
29-07-2019T17:46:14,FloofyCat,Usually newspapers will do this stuff as clickbait because people think there's some wonder miracle to lose weight without being constantly hungry and nope its just starving
29-07-2019T17:46:49,SpazztasticKiwi,I know tea changes the appetite
29-07-2019T17:46:54,SpazztasticKiwi,it fills you
29-07-2019T17:47:12,FloofyCat,Well technically if you just down a ton of water you'll feel satiated for a while
29-07-2019T17:49:12,SpazztasticKiwi,you know how scatterbrained I am keep that in mind
29-07-2019T17:49:16,SpazztasticKiwi,here‚Äôs a question
29-07-2019T17:49:37,SpazztasticKiwi,how many people you think are working at a food place at one time
29-07-2019T17:49:49,FloofyCat,Like a McDonald's or something?
29-07-2019T17:50:00,SpazztasticKiwi,sure ya
29-07-2019T17:50:56,FloofyCat,Urh well McDonald's has lots of customers so probably 16-20 in peak times and maybe around 8-12 during night shifts?
29-07-2019T17:51:04,FloofyCat,In a normal weekday
29-07-2019T17:51:42,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôd consider getting my local one some doughnuts
29-07-2019T17:52:16,SpazztasticKiwi,angry person came in threatened some of the back people
29-07-2019T17:52:24,FloofyCat,"If its lets say a Pizza Hut/Dominoes etc pizza takeaway then probably under ten, pizza is really easy to make and having 20 different menu items at lets say McDonald's is harder than having like 50 different pizza options because all you do is put passata"
29-07-2019T17:52:44,FloofyCat,"or pur√©e on a piece of flat unbaked bread, chuck on some topping that are in tubs and then cheese and shove it in an oven"
29-07-2019T17:53:15,SpazztasticKiwi,they don‚Äôt carry my green tea anymore
29-07-2019T17:53:21,SpazztasticKiwi,this is an outrage
29-07-2019T17:53:56,FloofyCat,I just drink an unhealthy amount of cola
29-07-2019T17:54:14,FloofyCat,I shouldn't because all the sugar but it tastes nice and its the only thing I got going for me right now
29-07-2019T17:54:59,SpazztasticKiwi,I used to drink an unholy amount of green tea straight just about every day
29-07-2019T17:55:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I didn‚Äôt eat too much it was so much and that became a problem
29-07-2019T17:56:49,SpazztasticKiwi,I still drink now obviously but I keep my 5 packets in one sitting to just that instead of drinking half a box in less than two days
29-07-2019T17:57:17,SpazztasticKiwi,and by box I‚Äôll say it was a box of 48 or something bags
29-07-2019T17:57:50,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm surprised I have taste buds drinking it that strong with nothing in it
29-07-2019T18:00:19,SpazztasticKiwi,ok so next to the tea they‚Äôre selling whole honeycomb
29-07-2019T19:40:15,AspiringNoodle,Wish me luck
