10-07-2019T04:37:51,AspiringNoodle,"I'll be honest, I could get used to this"
10-07-2019T04:38:05,AspiringNoodle,Going to bed around 12:30 and waking up around 5:30 :p
10-07-2019T04:38:27,AspiringNoodle,Especially if I can get over needing those naps in the afternoon.  I hope those aren't out of boredom.
10-07-2019T04:39:14,Bgrmystr2,sleeps only for 5 hours and wonders why he's tired. :v
10-07-2019T04:39:42,AspiringNoodle,It's a hell of a lot better when I was only able to sleep 3 hours at night ;)
10-07-2019T04:40:31,CrimsonQuill,"Hi, guys."
10-07-2019T04:40:37,CrimsonQuill,:ptv-greetings::ctwokinds-kingtea:
10-07-2019T04:40:42,Bgrmystr2,"I sleep a good 9 hrs each night, 7 to 10hrs usually,"
10-07-2019T04:40:53,Bgrmystr2,but mostly 9
10-07-2019T04:41:43,Bgrmystr2,"I never nap, never need to. I can go for prettymuch a 18 to 20 hr day anytime necessary."
10-07-2019T04:41:58,Bgrmystr2,but it never is xD
10-07-2019T04:42:27,AspiringNoodle,It's weird because my usual sleep schedule was 9 - 10 hours a night
10-07-2019T04:42:34,AspiringNoodle,And now I've flipped to the opposite end
10-07-2019T04:42:48,AspiringNoodle,"I'm sure if I stop napping in the afternoon, it'll go back to normal"
10-07-2019T04:46:05,CrimsonQuill,"So how are you two, besides being tired?"
10-07-2019T04:47:09,AspiringNoodle,Hungry!
10-07-2019T04:49:40,CrimsonQuill,Ok.
10-07-2019T04:49:50,CrimsonQuill,"And you, Brgmystr2?"
10-07-2019T04:50:27,Bgrmystr2,lurking and reading stuff.
10-07-2019T04:56:03,AspiringNoodle,"Okay, I'm good now :ptv-hearts:"
10-07-2019T05:00:10,CrimsonQuill,:)
10-07-2019T05:00:20,CrimsonQuill,I'm finally back up to speed with the main comic!
10-07-2019T05:00:54,CrimsonQuill,I meant to read 'Renunions' and then stop...but I wanted to see what I'd missed in 'Stories of the Estate.'
10-07-2019T05:01:18,CrimsonQuill,So Brutus being the wolf captured is a thing. Clovis' second in command...
10-07-2019T05:01:24,CrimsonQuill,Very curious.
10-07-2019T05:09:55,CrimsonQuill,...
10-07-2019T05:14:43,CrimsonQuill,May someone else please say something? It's a bit too quiet here...

10-07-2019T05:28:56,AspiringNoodle,OwO
10-07-2019T05:30:38,CrimsonQuill,XD I don't understand a word of that!
10-07-2019T06:35:22,AspiringNoodle,That moment when G.skill's Trident Z Royal memory is the only affordable 3600CL16 memory on the market :ptv-shock:

10-07-2019T07:02:23,AspiringNoodle,"Okay, at this point my interest in Extra Credits is purely morbid curiosity"
10-07-2019T07:02:50,AspiringNoodle,"Most of the time when there's ""controversy"" for a youtube channel, it blows up in their face, they take a hit for a few days, then things somewhat return to normal"
10-07-2019T07:03:25,AspiringNoodle,We are now on day NINE of them losing more subscribers than they gain.
10-07-2019T07:31:26,AspiringNoodle,"I finally moved my alarms in my phone back an hour, lol"

10-07-2019T08:53:01,CrimsonQuill,Fine thank you.
10-07-2019T08:53:05,CrimsonQuill,And for yourself?
10-07-2019T08:53:41,IronHorseComics,"good, I got this done this morning http://fav.me/ddbfjkq"
10-07-2019T08:58:32,CrimsonQuill,ok...
10-07-2019T08:58:38,AspiringNoodle,Finally though my youtube backlog. Again.
10-07-2019T08:58:39,AspiringNoodle,NO
10-07-2019T08:58:42,AspiringNoodle,MORE
10-07-2019T08:58:45,AspiringNoodle,TECH SPLURGES
10-07-2019T08:58:58,CrimsonQuill,I finally drew my Halo OC with some competance.
10-07-2019T08:59:02,CrimsonQuill,"At least, his head."
10-07-2019T08:59:14,CrimsonQuill,I'm mixing Tom's style with my own for him
10-07-2019T08:59:26,CrimsonQuill,Because he's Halo Raine's fireteam leader.
10-07-2019T08:59:30,AspiringNoodle,"Well, you could always quit while you're ""a""head :ptv-snicker:"
10-07-2019T08:59:40,CrimsonQuill,Ba-doom-CRASH
10-07-2019T09:00:28,AspiringNoodle,I'm probably about to disgust myself today
10-07-2019T09:00:37,AspiringNoodle,Gonna go to KFC to get that Cheetos Sandwich
10-07-2019T09:00:44,CrimsonQuill,"Also, how many videos where in that backlog>"
10-07-2019T09:00:48,AspiringNoodle,"American gluttony at its finest, *yaaaaaaaay~*"
10-07-2019T09:01:23,AspiringNoodle,"Well, I've started queueing up videos in the morning, dictating that to be my youtube watchlist for the day, since it's easier to do that first thing instead of right before bed"
10-07-2019T09:01:34,CrimsonQuill,ok
10-07-2019T09:01:38,AspiringNoodle,But computex and Zen 2 both easily added HOURS of video to go through
10-07-2019T09:01:52,CrimsonQuill,Oh dear.
10-07-2019T09:02:00,AspiringNoodle,"And Zen 2 also added written articles / reviews to go through as well, since it's a bit more technical"
10-07-2019T09:02:13,CrimsonQuill,I keep re-watching videos I like and reading tv tropes.
10-07-2019T09:02:34,AspiringNoodle,"On the bright side, I'm determined in what I'm getting, at the bare minimum"
10-07-2019T09:02:59,AspiringNoodle,"R9 3900x, 32GB 3600CL16 DDR4, RTX 2080 or 2080 Super"
10-07-2019T09:03:14,CrimsonQuill,Niiiice.7
10-07-2019T09:03:26,CrimsonQuill,I'm going to re-draw the art trade I did to do it justice.
10-07-2019T09:03:35,CrimsonQuill,Because I rushed it towards the end.
10-07-2019T09:03:40,AspiringNoodle,"At this point, I'm waiting on Steve's review of the 3700x to see if he gets any noticeable gaming differences"
10-07-2019T09:03:45,CrimsonQuill,And I'm also going to make a reference sheet for my OC.
10-07-2019T09:04:24,AspiringNoodle,I feel like artists should do the redraw challenge when it comes to any childhood drawings they may have lying around :)
10-07-2019T09:04:39,AspiringNoodle,"""TAKE THAT, YOUNGER ME!"""
10-07-2019T09:04:49,AspiringNoodle,"""ababababababa *pbtbtbtbtbtbtbt*"""
10-07-2019T09:04:58,CrimsonQuill,One of my very first colour deviations was a proper drawing of an old sketch.
10-07-2019T09:05:02,IronHorseComics,well I did consider that
10-07-2019T09:05:18,AspiringNoodle,"I'd consider it, but I don't think we have anything lying around ;)"
10-07-2019T09:05:45,CrimsonQuill,I'm just trying to become better....
10-07-2019T09:05:48,CrimsonQuill,Besides.
10-07-2019T09:05:48,IronHorseComics,"well actually I do, technically"
10-07-2019T09:06:09,CrimsonQuill,"For my Halo headcanon, I'm going to need to be good at drawing to do Halo Raine justice."
10-07-2019T09:06:20,CrimsonQuill,:ctwokinds-rainehappy:
10-07-2019T09:06:20,IronHorseComics,"I used to draw race cars as a little kid but I sucked at it, now I draw them for a webcomic and I'm adequate at it"
10-07-2019T09:09:22,AspiringNoodle,Buildzoid ranting about Asus x570 boards for an hour: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqHd_tFqvj0
10-07-2019T09:09:27,AspiringNoodle,You see what I put up with?!?
10-07-2019T09:09:41,AspiringNoodle,Sometimes I wish I didn't care about performance so much ;_;
10-07-2019T09:09:57,CrimsonQuill,Jeepers
10-07-2019T09:12:17,AspiringNoodle,Part of the reason is that Zen 2 is relatively new.  It's based upon Zen but they switched up a bunch of stuff
10-07-2019T09:12:47,AspiringNoodle,And Ryzen is unique in that RAM ACTUALLY makes a difference
10-07-2019T09:13:28,AspiringNoodle,Ponying up the money for premium ram (3200CL14/3600CL16) can net serious gains over cheepo 2133/2400 basic
10-07-2019T09:13:57,AspiringNoodle,"For the 2700X, going with 3200CL14 memory over 2133 resulted in performance games akin to a mild OC."
10-07-2019T09:14:32,AspiringNoodle,"Intel's processors are rather independent from RAM, so there's an extra layer going on."
10-07-2019T09:19:03,AspiringNoodle,"If you got a headache reading my rant, just imagine me, with the info I've been sorting through that I DIDN'T include here"
10-07-2019T09:21:22,IronHorseComics,I can believe it
10-07-2019T09:22:08,AspiringNoodle,"More or less, I""ve been keeping up with Zen for the past 2 years xD"
10-07-2019T09:22:19,CrimsonQuill,has stopped comprehending. Please stand by for diagnostics check.
10-07-2019T09:22:29,AspiringNoodle,"And given how much money I'm gonna pour into this thing, I will accept nothing less than the most performance possible"
10-07-2019T09:23:03,AspiringNoodle,"Ofc, it's frustrating because now I gotta wait for availability to come back xD"
10-07-2019T09:23:26,AspiringNoodle,And even then I might have to deal with the growing pains of BIOS updates for the new mobos :/
10-07-2019T09:23:37,IronHorseComics,"sits here, trying to think of stuff"
10-07-2019T09:25:05,AspiringNoodle,That said... I'll probably end up holding off on attempting to OC my CPU until a few months down the line :ptv-laugh:
10-07-2019T09:25:29,AspiringNoodle,Just use the built in PBO and enjoy that while they sort out the BIOS issues
10-07-2019T09:26:09,IronHorseComics,"I can't help but think when you said ""OC my CPU"" you meant turn her into a waifu..."
10-07-2019T09:26:39,AspiringNoodle,"Pfft, it's more boring"
10-07-2019T09:26:56,AspiringNoodle,"The bright side is, I have an idea of what's the highest overclock you can get on these new chips"
10-07-2019T09:42:16,AspiringNoodle,*sigh*
10-07-2019T09:42:22,AspiringNoodle,"Well, I'll be back later, ready to hate myself"
10-07-2019T09:42:37,AspiringNoodle,*secretely hopes KFC doesn't have new sandwich so can get famous bowl instead*
10-07-2019T09:43:22,IronHorseComics,if KFC would get rid of those potato wedges for real french fries I'd go there more often
10-07-2019T09:43:43,AspiringNoodle,"Hey, I *like* those potato wedges"
10-07-2019T09:43:48,AspiringNoodle,"Are we gonna have a problem, here?"
10-07-2019T09:44:16,IronHorseComics,"no, I just think the wedges suck"
10-07-2019T09:55:52,AspiringNoodle,been thinking
10-07-2019T09:56:21,AspiringNoodle,I think I know what mobo I'm gonna get
10-07-2019T09:56:41,AspiringNoodle,"the MSI Ace, since it's the only mobo that has a heatpipe connecting the chipset and VRM without spending $700 xD"
10-07-2019T10:06:54,CrimsonQuill,I'm tidying my room a bit.
10-07-2019T10:06:58,CrimsonQuill,So much dust...
10-07-2019T10:07:05,CrimsonQuill,And so many blooming spiders!

10-07-2019T16:56:56,CrimsonQuill,"Teapot, Sorry about the spelling error!"
10-07-2019T16:57:26,TeapotOfDoom,turns into a liquid at etches a hole in the ground
10-07-2019T16:57:36,TeapotOfDoom,now ima teapit
10-07-2019T16:58:06,CrimsonQuill,Noooooo
10-07-2019T16:58:11,TeapotOfDoom,Haha
10-07-2019T16:58:25,Bgrmystr2,well don't go to orleans cuz the flood water in the greater city is apparently toxic.
10-07-2019T16:58:27,TeapotOfDoom,Hi Quill ^^
10-07-2019T16:58:38,Bgrmystr2,and you don't wanna be undrinkable tea
10-07-2019T16:58:51,Bgrmystr2,there's no evac for my area yet :C
10-07-2019T16:58:52,TeapotOfDoom,wait W H A T ?
10-07-2019T16:59:20,TeapotOfDoom,you got a hurricane incoming bgr?
10-07-2019T16:59:40,Bgrmystr2,"literally not read a single message I sent today besides my first one, eh?"
10-07-2019T17:00:18,TeapotOfDoom,only what i can read in the chat history now
10-07-2019T17:00:23,IronHorseComics,it's in the gulf as of now headed toward the the area between Florida panhandle and west Louisiana
10-07-2019T17:00:39,TeapotOfDoom,oh sh
10-07-2019T17:00:42,CrimsonQuill,"Seriously though, stay safe Bgr."
10-07-2019T17:00:48,CrimsonQuill,I hope you'll be alright.
10-07-2019T17:00:51,IronHorseComics,don't think it's katrina bad
10-07-2019T17:01:08,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, translation being New Orleans Proper, where it's already poured 6 or so inches of rain and there's flooding now."
10-07-2019T17:01:10,TeapotOfDoom,best of luck stay safe
10-07-2019T17:01:21,Bgrmystr2,and that was before it got into the gulf.
10-07-2019T17:01:29,Bgrmystr2,now it's coming back cuz it wanted to see us again :D
10-07-2019T17:01:35,TeapotOfDoom,but my what was about the toxic water
10-07-2019T17:01:58,TeapotOfDoom,it likes you more
10-07-2019T17:01:59,IronHorseComics,"""Hang on, I forgot there's a bunch of aints fans that need a good thrashing"""

10-07-2019T17:02:38,IronHorseComics,"""Im'a just come back and do that real quick"" -Hurricane"
10-07-2019T17:03:00,Bgrmystr2,Floodwater in the past has killed people due to pretty scary bacteria in the water
10-07-2019T17:03:47,Bgrmystr2,that was during Katrina
10-07-2019T17:03:56,Bgrmystr2,but with the floodwater already standing now
10-07-2019T17:04:03,TeapotOfDoom,wow didn't know that but seems logical
10-07-2019T17:04:06,Bgrmystr2,and the storm coming in the next day or so
10-07-2019T17:04:10,Bgrmystr2,there's going to be more
10-07-2019T17:04:49,Bgrmystr2,I'm mostly worried about the levee breaks since I live within walking distance of one.
10-07-2019T17:05:21,Bgrmystr2,The one around here isn't one of the ones known for failure but.. you never know
10-07-2019T17:05:25,Bgrmystr2,the others weren't either.
10-07-2019T17:05:35,IronHorseComics,"oh man, that sucks"
10-07-2019T17:05:47,TeapotOfDoom,yeah big time
10-07-2019T17:08:27,Bgrmystr2,"Well, if I'm not here for Friday or Sunday, you know why. :ptv-laugh:"
10-07-2019T17:09:07,CrimsonQuill,"Stay safe, bgr. :ctwokinds-maevecute:"
10-07-2019T17:09:56,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: You say that but I'm not gonna do anything particularly unsafe. I just figure I'm not going out anywhere. The unsafe is going to come to me.
10-07-2019T17:10:12,CrimsonQuill,...7
10-07-2019T17:10:21,Bgrmystr2,Maybe it just needs a hug.
10-07-2019T17:10:26,TeapotOfDoom,lol
10-07-2019T17:10:30,Bgrmystr2,Everyone has one of those days
10-07-2019T17:10:53,TeapotOfDoom,don't hug it to hard then
10-07-2019T17:12:14,IronHorseComics,hopefully it won't turn into a sharknado
10-07-2019T17:12:44,TeapotOfDoom,or sharknado 2
10-07-2019T17:14:08,Bgrmystr2,no it'll be more like Snakenado
10-07-2019T17:14:22,Bgrmystr2,or Gatornado / Crocnado
10-07-2019T17:14:32,Bgrmystr2,or a mix of the three.
10-07-2019T17:15:47,IronHorseComics,"I'd be okay with the snakes, none of the American ones are big enough to eat me"
10-07-2019T17:16:05,IronHorseComics,"well, North American native at least"
10-07-2019T17:17:50,CrimsonQuill,I have to head to bed.
10-07-2019T17:18:02,CrimsonQuill,"Bgr, I hope you'll be alright. Take care."
10-07-2019T17:18:07,CrimsonQuill,"Everyone else, sleep well."
10-07-2019T17:18:21,CrimsonQuill,:ptv-greetings::ctwokinds-rainehappy::ctwokinds-RainezZz::ctwokinds-RainezZz::ctwokinds-RainezZz:
10-07-2019T17:18:36,Bgrmystr2,"a lot of the snakes here are venomous. they won't eat you, but they will bite you and it may kill you if not treated"
10-07-2019T17:18:45,Bgrmystr2,so there's that
10-07-2019T17:18:51,Bgrmystr2,gnight Quill
10-07-2019T17:19:32,IronHorseComics,that is also true
10-07-2019T17:20:09,TeapotOfDoom,seems nice...
10-07-2019T17:20:26,TeapotOfDoom,im off to bed too. night y'all!
10-07-2019T17:20:54,Bgrmystr2,gnight teapot
10-07-2019T17:33:32,SpazztasticKiwi,the creek at the park is flodded
10-07-2019T17:35:00,AspiringNoodle,"Okay, I think I need to bite this nap thing in the bud"
10-07-2019T17:35:10,AspiringNoodle,"Try to go in for a small nap, sleep for 2x as long as I wanted"
10-07-2019T17:36:18,IronHorseComics,you'll feel great coming out
10-07-2019T17:36:35,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s normally a foot deep. today it’s nearly flooding over the bridges and conjesting the stormdrains
10-07-2019T17:37:29,SpazztasticKiwi,good thing I decided to try wearing my swimsuit to run
10-07-2019T17:47:47,AspiringNoodle,Don't swim in that :c

10-07-2019T18:10:30,qwe304,just realized i colored eric like santa
10-07-2019T18:12:08,AspiringNoodle,She'll give anyone a white Christmas?
10-07-2019T18:12:13,AspiringNoodle,...I'll leave now xD
10-07-2019T18:15:19,AspiringNoodle,"My gutter mind aside, lookin' good so far"
10-07-2019T18:47:21,IronHorseComics,I concur
10-07-2019T18:53:09,AspiringNoodle,Oh boy...
10-07-2019T18:53:14,AspiringNoodle,Newegg got 3800x in stock
10-07-2019T18:53:31,AspiringNoodle,Now I must look and see if there's anywhere you get performance benefits out of it D:
10-07-2019T18:56:56,IronHorseComics,you find you only get 0.000001 extra MB of ram with ti
10-07-2019T19:02:12,AspiringNoodle,I've been curious about 3800X's overclocking potential
10-07-2019T19:02:38,AspiringNoodle,"Both it and the 3700X are 8c/16t processors, but the 3700X has a base/boost of 3.6/4.4 and the 3800x 3.9/4.5"
10-07-2019T19:02:47,AspiringNoodle,TDPs are also 65W and 105W respectively
10-07-2019T19:02:57,IronHorseComics,yeah you've lost me
10-07-2019T19:03:34,AspiringNoodle,TDP more or less represents how much heat they put out
10-07-2019T19:04:13,IronHorseComics,"ah, okay"
10-07-2019T19:04:15,AspiringNoodle,"I assume that the 3800X is able to OC higher because of the massively increased TDP, but at the same time... all outlets seem to be only able to get 4.3Ghz on all cores, regardless of processor"
10-07-2019T19:04:24,AspiringNoodle,4.4Ghz if they're lucky and/or disable hyperthreading
10-07-2019T19:25:26,AspiringNoodle,"Well, like I thought, nobody seems to have reviewed the 3800x"
10-07-2019T19:25:49,AspiringNoodle,"Seems like they weren't sent out to reviewers, so I wonder if you're paying an extra $70 for the increased base clock"
10-07-2019T19:26:00,AspiringNoodle,"Aka, worthless to manual overclockers"
10-07-2019T19:27:15,IronHorseComics,I thought all overclocking was manual
10-07-2019T19:27:41,Bgrmystr2,"well, someone has to write a program for the chip to overclock, so in a way yes"
10-07-2019T19:27:54,Bgrmystr2,"but as long as there's an automation for it, then no."
10-07-2019T19:28:24,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, they are inanimate objects after all, we have to do everything :P"
10-07-2019T19:29:53,AspiringNoodle,"It depends.  With Ryzen, there's 3 ways to go about it"
10-07-2019T19:30:15,AspiringNoodle,"You can leave everything stock, you can turn on PBO (additional OC on top of default settings), or manual OC"
10-07-2019T19:31:08,AspiringNoodle,"If you use either of the first 2, then the 3800X MAY be worth the extra $70, but the 25% increased price won't equate to 25% more performance (less than 10% increase to base clock, 2% to boost)"
10-07-2019T19:31:47,Bgrmystr2,"a default overclock someone had to write and code, so it's still manual technically. :P"
10-07-2019T19:32:06,Bgrmystr2,just written so we don't have to directly do it every time
10-07-2019T19:32:50,Ordithus,:robot:
10-07-2019T19:33:10,AspiringNoodle,"Manual overclocking, on the other hand, in an uncontrolled experiment that only ends when either the hardware dies, or the experimenter is satisfied with the results >:3"
10-07-2019T19:33:40,Bgrmystr2,"well duh, but you know automatic overclocking would result in the same thing if it was also uncontrolled :P"
10-07-2019T19:34:03,Bgrmystr2,you're talking about it like it's two coins when it's two sides of the same coin
10-07-2019T19:34:38,AspiringNoodle,Not exactly
10-07-2019T19:35:01,AspiringNoodle,The default needs to fit within a stricter range of tolerances that 99% of produced processors need to be able to meet
10-07-2019T19:35:35,AspiringNoodle,"The manual oc, on the other hand, is up to whatever the overclocker decides is tolerable, and will push the chip however far that chip is capable of going."
10-07-2019T19:35:53,Bgrmystr2,yes actually. You're again deciding that two sides of a coin are not the same coin. ;u
10-07-2019T19:36:26,AspiringNoodle,...
10-07-2019T19:36:54,AspiringNoodle,"I'm saying they're the same, but different -_-"
10-07-2019T19:38:02,Bgrmystr2,"from how it reads to me, tis the opposite. But I'll give ya a :knife: / 10"
10-07-2019T19:39:48,AspiringNoodle,"Here's a good question, how the hell could they be that different?"
10-07-2019T19:40:03,AspiringNoodle,The entire point is to define the operational speed of the processor
10-07-2019T19:40:42,Bgrmystr2,"Hey, you're the one stating they're so different. :V"
10-07-2019T19:40:44,AspiringNoodle,"It's just that one has to meet guidelines for things like temperature, voltage, and stability that will apply to (ideally) every processor that passes production"
10-07-2019T19:41:18,AspiringNoodle,"The other seeks to squeeze the most performance out of a given processor, and what the user defines as ""acceptable"" is unique to them and that processor"
10-07-2019T19:41:43,AspiringNoodle,"That doesn't scream ""they are obviously two whole different beasts"""
10-07-2019T19:42:33,Bgrmystr2,"you and I have a very different definition of ""different"" :thinking:"
10-07-2019T19:44:37,AspiringNoodle,"Here's where I think the ""two different coin"" argument would come into play"
10-07-2019T19:44:56,AspiringNoodle,Imagine if CPU manufacturers did manual overclocking for every processor they made xD
10-07-2019T19:45:23,AspiringNoodle,Mainly because of the absurdity of the idea
10-07-2019T19:47:53,Bgrmystr2,"just because they don't doesn't mean it isn't possible. They don't due to probably already having pushed the chip to the point where it's being overclocked and them marketing as a ""base"" clock anyway."
10-07-2019T19:48:39,AspiringNoodle,"When you think about it... the whole idea of ""overclocking"" is ridiculous"
10-07-2019T19:48:44,Bgrmystr2,"what we see as ""overclock"" and ""base clock"" are simply numbers. There's no baseline, it's all 100% arbitrary. Any core can have any baseline, and overclocking is just simply increasing it above."
10-07-2019T19:49:25,AspiringNoodle,"We act like we're squeezing out extra performance (and we are), but it's because manufacturers leave performance on the table xd"
10-07-2019T19:49:39,Bgrmystr2,"The 9900k could easily have a baseline of 5ghz but the core would then be recieved as running very hot all the time and need superior cooling, etc"
10-07-2019T19:50:14,Bgrmystr2,"so they don't, they make it like 4ghz, so people can ""overclock"" it to 5 and see the same results just as if Intel had made 5ghz the base."
10-07-2019T19:50:18,AspiringNoodle,"Well, maybe if intel's coolers weren't complete shite ;)"
10-07-2019T19:50:37,Bgrmystr2,"yes well, their coolers are irrelevant, it's all just theoretical anyway :v"
10-07-2019T19:51:00,Bgrmystr2,this is just presuming they were a company with any shred of dignity in the past 10 years anyway lol
10-07-2019T19:51:02,AspiringNoodle,I like AMD because their cooler is actually good
10-07-2019T19:51:04,Bgrmystr2,if not before
10-07-2019T19:52:04,AspiringNoodle,"Alright Bgr, this is relevant to your experience"
10-07-2019T19:52:19,AspiringNoodle,Have you ever had trouble running multiple kits of memory together in the past?
10-07-2019T19:53:20,AspiringNoodle,"I've done it with my computer, but that's more or less because inexperience"
10-07-2019T19:53:25,Bgrmystr2,"hmm, aside from having sticks that are dead, not really."
10-07-2019T19:54:39,AspiringNoodle,Cause Newegg has some 3600CL16 available for normal pricing
10-07-2019T19:55:03,AspiringNoodle,But only in 2-stick packs
10-07-2019T20:03:42,AspiringNoodle,"Okay, Bgr"
10-07-2019T20:03:58,AspiringNoodle,Corsair's Dominator Platinum or Vengeance Pro? :P
10-07-2019T20:04:15,AspiringNoodle,"Personally, I like the Vegeance Pro's looks a bit more"
10-07-2019T20:07:37,Bgrmystr2,I like the looks of the Vengance and they look like they would cool much easier
10-07-2019T20:07:37,Bgrmystr2,but
10-07-2019T20:07:47,Bgrmystr2,the Dominator just seems like it's superior
10-07-2019T20:07:55,Bgrmystr2,on top of being cheaper
10-07-2019T20:08:05,AspiringNoodle,"Check out the RGB, lol"
10-07-2019T20:08:11,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, do not want."
10-07-2019T20:08:18,Bgrmystr2,the only downside of it lol
10-07-2019T20:08:26,AspiringNoodle,the 3600CL16 kits for both are the same 16-18-18-36 timing
10-07-2019T20:08:37,AspiringNoodle,But the dominator is $20 more per 16GB kit
10-07-2019T20:09:00,Bgrmystr2,uh.. then you're not looking at the same site I am.
10-07-2019T20:09:41,Bgrmystr2,and there's a $45 difference
10-07-2019T20:09:47,Bgrmystr2,with the Domniator being cheaper
10-07-2019T20:10:40,Bgrmystr2,"not only that, but the dominator is 3000Mhz, the Vengance is 2400."
10-07-2019T20:11:00,Bgrmystr2,"for almost $50 more expensive, I wouldn't touch the vengance."
10-07-2019T20:11:16,Bgrmystr2,esp at $200 price point for only 16gb
10-07-2019T20:11:19,Bgrmystr2,get the fuck out lol
10-07-2019T20:12:21,AspiringNoodle,"Newegg, bruh :D"
10-07-2019T20:12:28,Bgrmystr2,not looking at newegg
10-07-2019T20:12:34,IronHorseComics,bruh
10-07-2019T20:12:54,Bgrmystr2,I'm looking at Corsair's official website so I can get a fair comparison instead of watching newegg have a sale on one but not the other
10-07-2019T20:12:58,AspiringNoodle,You're not even looking at the same spec memory..
10-07-2019T20:13:09,Bgrmystr2,tis what came up xD
10-07-2019T20:13:49,AspiringNoodle,Dummeh
10-07-2019T20:14:10,Bgrmystr2,"I take no blame for this, all you said was Vengance and Dominator."
10-07-2019T20:14:14,Bgrmystr2,You did not specify.
10-07-2019T20:14:16,Bgrmystr2,Anything.
10-07-2019T20:14:25,Bgrmystr2,"that's your fault, mister. :P"
10-07-2019T20:14:31,Bgrmystr2,so you are the Dummeh :V
10-07-2019T20:15:32,AspiringNoodle,Well Corsair's site is garbage
10-07-2019T20:15:40,AspiringNoodle,Don't even have listings for 3600CL16 memory :/
10-07-2019T20:15:43,Bgrmystr2,and yeah why the fuck would you buy that 16gb set on newegg for $220 when you can get it on Corsair's website for around $150
10-07-2019T20:16:03,IronHorseComics,usually the 3rd party retailer is cheaper...
10-07-2019T20:16:20,Bgrmystr2,ironic haha
10-07-2019T20:16:33,IronHorseComics,there must be something else to it
10-07-2019T20:16:40,Bgrmystr2,maybe
10-07-2019T20:16:43,AspiringNoodle,"Correction, they do have a listing for 3600CL16"
10-07-2019T20:16:52,AspiringNoodle,But it's a $920 64GB kit of Dominator
10-07-2019T20:17:06,Bgrmystr2,hm brb
10-07-2019T20:19:14,IronHorseComics,"been feel'n like adjusting my cat designs, namely the face, I feel like they're TOO human like, but then again I have gotten used to the two main cats and changing now might be a bad thing..."
10-07-2019T20:19:25,IronHorseComics,plus I don't like a lot of designs I see
10-07-2019T20:20:36,AspiringNoodle,I've been thinking about that
10-07-2019T20:20:50,AspiringNoodle,There's a bit of uncanny valley going on when I look at them
10-07-2019T20:21:00,IronHorseComics,mine or other designs?

10-07-2019T20:21:47,AspiringNoodle,"The face is very human like, but then they have the large, broad nose of a big cat, along with the wide bridge"
10-07-2019T20:22:00,IronHorseComics,"not sure what to do here, whose to look at and borrow from"
10-07-2019T20:22:10,AspiringNoodle,"But at the same time, I'm just an amatuer who keeps procrastinating on practicing, so what do I know? xD"
10-07-2019T20:23:03,AspiringNoodle,"Aside from staying the course and making it a defined style, either the nose can be shrunk down a tad, or the face can go more feral"
10-07-2019T20:23:09,IronHorseComics,I feel like Tom has hit a good middle ground but I don't want to borrow EVERYTHING from his style
10-07-2019T20:24:09,AspiringNoodle,"I'd argue that you could use his anatomical style, but still make other design decisions to differentiate yourself"
10-07-2019T20:24:24,AspiringNoodle,"Such as clothing, hair, color choice"
10-07-2019T20:25:00,IronHorseComics,"it's mainly the face I wanna adjust, maybe move the ears a little bit"
10-07-2019T20:25:09,IronHorseComics,*while I'm at it
10-07-2019T20:25:41,AspiringNoodle,"The other argument is, you could alter your style to match his as a jumping off point"
10-07-2019T20:25:53,AspiringNoodle,"But from there onwards, you develop on your own"
10-07-2019T20:32:01,IronHorseComics,"it's gonna be a massive pain finding that sweet spot, the dogs were easy to figure out, but cats, especially ""big cats"" like Shawa and Zoey (leopard and tiger respectively)"
10-07-2019T20:32:17,IronHorseComics,they are not

10-07-2019T20:55:40,IronHorseComics,"okay, I think I got something, let me adjust to bikini Zoey a bit..."
10-07-2019T21:03:33,Bgrmystr2,"To be honest, I don't see anything disgusting about it. I think that's a viewer's problem."
10-07-2019T21:03:55,Ordithus,Methinks Kiwi is jelly
10-07-2019T21:08:06,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-maddiessparkles: I'm jelly
10-07-2019T21:08:50,IronHorseComics,Jelly? Sweet
10-07-2019T21:09:32,Bgrmystr2,"Ironically, most of that type of jelly is salty xD"

10-07-2019T21:10:55,SpazztasticKiwi,"and at the moment in particular, being single or finding someone is on kinda the same field with me anymore"
10-07-2019T21:11:27,SpazztasticKiwi,"the luck I have, maybe I’ll run into someone or maybe I’ll be with my cats for my life single"
10-07-2019T21:11:58,Bgrmystr2,"and I didn't mean you kiwi, but just that most ppl who get angry about people with very minimal PDA which you'd expect from couples"
10-07-2019T21:12:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh man
10-07-2019T21:12:13,Bgrmystr2,is just ppl being lonely and taking it out on others :u
