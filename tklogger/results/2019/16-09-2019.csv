16-09-2019T01:50:53,DarthRexKing,This is the rare Alice Titan. She comes with shockwave powers.
16-09-2019T01:51:15,AspiringNoodle,The only way this whole segment would be MORE badass is if Alice had enough of the Queen's bs and just went full armored titan on the castle

16-09-2019T01:51:39,DarthRexKing,I suggest pausing the video and watching youtube gameplay on this level.

16-09-2019T01:56:26,DarthRexKing,Perhaps these hearts require a series of stomps before the hearts explode?

16-09-2019T02:04:04,MarvTheHugPharaoh,A good acid trip
16-09-2019T02:04:06,DarthRexKing,Is there an explanation how the red queen created this fleshy castle area which I assume is her?
16-09-2019T02:04:12,DarthRexKing,>W> lol.
16-09-2019T02:04:20,AspiringNoodle,Maybe the creator was inspired by Tim Burton?

16-09-2019T13:46:23,AspiringNoodle,"On the bright side, I might get less hours without needing to ask.  I don't think my manager knew I was part time"
16-09-2019T13:46:38,CrimsonQuill,Nice.
16-09-2019T13:47:15,TerraTheWizard,just been a boring ol' standard day for me
16-09-2019T13:48:17,CrimsonQuill,"Boring is ok...There's an ancient curse from Asia , I think, and the Terry Pratchett book 'The last Continent' ; ""May you live in interesting times!"""
16-09-2019T13:49:04,mingun,"@Twokinds: Tom, I have a question about 7 missing suggestions from past stream. How many votes did they get?"
16-09-2019T13:49:06,TerraTheWizard,and that just reminded me i had a short story i wanted to write around that
16-09-2019T13:49:11,CrimsonQuill,How about you Tom
16-09-2019T13:51:47,TerraTheWizard,"oh, actually i did do a thing today"
16-09-2019T13:52:27,TerraTheWizard,went through the twokinds extras archive turaiel runs to find stuff i've not seen before
16-09-2019T13:52:38,TerraTheWizard,found some character concepts :eyes:

16-09-2019T13:56:16,TerraTheWizard,https://www.turaiel.me/twokinds/images/Willow%20Wisp%20Faces.png
16-09-2019T13:59:07,CrimsonQuill,I love those ones! I remember he brought them up...
16-09-2019T13:59:21,CrimsonQuill,I've been trying my hand at character sheets too...
16-09-2019T14:00:01,CrimsonQuill,I remember he brought the Willow one up because I mentioned my aunt's cat with that name. I think that was the stream that Halfkind girl was drawn...
16-09-2019T14:00:47,CrimsonQuill,That was a nice one.
16-09-2019T14:16:41,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-nibsdance:
16-09-2019T14:34:39,BadFoMo,Yo.
16-09-2019T14:34:49,CrimsonQuill,Hi Fomo
16-09-2019T14:45:05,IronHorseComics,*appears*
16-09-2019T14:46:24,BadFoMo,Yo.
16-09-2019T14:47:12,Twokinds,Man I wish I could have made that project come together.
16-09-2019T14:47:28,BadFoMo,The Stargate one?
16-09-2019T14:47:31,Twokinds,Maybe someday. I just didn't have a complete enough story to go with the characters.
16-09-2019T14:48:06,BadFoMo,Oh! The RiftWall one.
16-09-2019T14:48:17,BadFoMo,*Rift Wall?
16-09-2019T14:48:31,CrimsonQuill,"It's ok Tom, I'm still prevaricating about my Halo fancomic"
16-09-2019T14:48:50,CrimsonQuill,We all have those ideas
16-09-2019T14:48:56,BadFoMo,Yep.
16-09-2019T14:49:56,Twokinds,Concepts are easy. But story is hard.
16-09-2019T14:50:10,IronHorseComics,Rift Wall?
16-09-2019T14:50:12,BadFoMo,is trying to git stories of mutant animals in the Left 4 Dead world off the ground.
16-09-2019T14:50:18,Twokinds,Anyone can write a premise.
16-09-2019T14:50:20,BadFoMo,*get
16-09-2019T14:50:33,CrimsonQuill,@Twokinds That's happened way too many times for me.
16-09-2019T14:50:40,CrimsonQuill,I can make a general idea fine.
16-09-2019T14:50:47,CrimsonQuill,But I suck at characterisation.
16-09-2019T14:51:58,CrimsonQuill,"Part of why I'm talking so much about a fancomic is that while it's not my universe, I actually feel like I have an idea as to story for once."
16-09-2019T14:52:33,CrimsonQuill,When I was 13 I wanted to make a sci fi thing based on Calvin and Hobbes' alter ego Spaceman Spiff
16-09-2019T14:52:52,CrimsonQuill,It then became basically a mashup of whatever scifi I was interested in at the time
16-09-2019T14:52:58,CrimsonQuill,Until I gave it up
16-09-2019T14:53:04,IronHorseComics,"I had many ideas growing up, NONE of them were that good"
16-09-2019T14:57:35,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-nibsbounce:
16-09-2019T15:14:55,BadFoMo,"So, I know it's /way/ too early to think about it, but what does anyone think of this for my November request?"
16-09-2019T15:14:59,BadFoMo,96.	Rose messing with/testing Half-Kinds Red and Raine by simply saying “Awoo.” causing them to reluctantly howl after failing to resist doing so.
16-09-2019T15:15:24,CrimsonQuill,That'd be funny.
16-09-2019T15:15:46,CrimsonQuill,"I like seeing the both of them in halfkind forms, like in that sketch 'Half and Half'"
16-09-2019T15:16:00,WINDOWS98SE,"@Twokinds If you see this, I apologize for some of the things I said in chat and in Patreon comments."
16-09-2019T15:16:06,WINDOWS98SE,"I think I came across a bit too strong and after talking with others in the community, I now realize I was jumping to conclusions about certain things."
16-09-2019T15:16:17,WINDOWS98SE,"On a lighter note, I see Tom's followers is now at 7777."
16-09-2019T15:16:52,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-KeithNeat:
16-09-2019T15:16:57,CrimsonQuill,Woah. That's a lot of people.

16-09-2019T15:35:42,tehbear,Tom was planning a comic based around the rift wall?
16-09-2019T15:41:24,tehbear,"looking back at ch 18, the riftwall is mentioned as a portal to other taverns or places, but they stopped working. spooky."
16-09-2019T16:00:54,SniperJackal,If there s so many people here I guess Il join to
16-09-2019T16:00:57,SniperJackal,too*
16-09-2019T16:43:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom wuddup
16-09-2019T16:51:22,tehbear,Hi Kiwi
16-09-2019T16:56:33,CrimsonQuill,"Hi Sniper, Kiwi, Tehbear"
16-09-2019T16:57:34,tehbear,youre still awake quill
16-09-2019T16:58:04,tehbear,what would you do if you had a rift wall in your house? brick it up? try to get it working?
16-09-2019T17:06:08,CrimsonQuill,"...I'd see where it goes, either with a camera drone or myself."
16-09-2019T17:06:10,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-clovisgirl_shake:
16-09-2019T17:06:16,CrimsonQuill,THEN I might try to make it work.
16-09-2019T17:07:11,TerraTheWizard,well you can't see where it goes if it's not working
16-09-2019T17:14:08,tehbear,"if i wasnt able to get it working, and bricked it up, hearing noises on the otherside later would be terrifying"
16-09-2019T17:14:25,tehbear,"so maybe it would be better to put up some alarm, to detect visitors"
16-09-2019T17:40:18,CrimsonQuill,I'm going to bed now. Goodnight everyone!

16-09-2019T21:00:46,Dadrobit,"Damn, just went over to one of my parents rental properties."
16-09-2019T21:01:04,Dadrobit,The family there abandoned the property and left it absolutely trashed.
16-09-2019T21:02:10,Dadrobit,"Roaches everywhere, holes in the walls, 80% of the lights are missing, animal refuse on the floor, trash everywhere..."
16-09-2019T21:02:35,Dadrobit,Fucking assholes man.
16-09-2019T21:03:20,Dadrobit,"I personally spent weeks renovating that house, replacing walls, tiling the floors and bathroom wall, re-roofed the whole damn thing."
16-09-2019T21:03:51,Dadrobit,Fuckin' sucks seeing all that get ruined by a couple fuckwits.
16-09-2019T21:04:23,Dadrobit,They left so fast their kid even forgot his backpack and student ID.
16-09-2019T21:05:31,CrRAR,wow
16-09-2019T21:05:44,CrRAR,serious disrespect
16-09-2019T21:07:45,CrRAR,I just can fathom being a renter and having the mindset of letting a place go like that knowing you're dumping the mess on someone else.
16-09-2019T21:08:34,CrRAR,"Users and abusers, ;_;"
16-09-2019T21:09:02,CrRAR,"also, *can't"
16-09-2019T21:09:44,BadFoMo,Sounds like my 'friend's' family's last tenents.
16-09-2019T21:10:04,CrRAR,ugh
16-09-2019T21:10:52,BadFoMo,They learned their lessen. No more renting out.
16-09-2019T21:12:47,BadFoMo,"The cherry on top, was that the renters were there to watch the place and make sure the place /didn't/ get trashed."
16-09-2019T21:13:02,CrRAR,xD
16-09-2019T21:13:45,CrRAR,Serious Beavis and Butthead mentality.
16-09-2019T21:13:53,CrRAR,*moves in*
16-09-2019T21:14:00,CrRAR,*sits on couch*
16-09-2019T21:14:08,CrRAR,*tosses food scraps and other garbage around*
16-09-2019T21:14:14,CrRAR,*4 months goes by*
16-09-2019T21:14:20,CrRAR,*Family looks around*
16-09-2019T21:14:27,CrRAR,"""This place SUCKS"""

16-09-2019T21:14:48,CrRAR,(hehhehheh hehheh)
16-09-2019T21:24:35,Dadrobit,"Family was only there just short of 4 months which is roughly when my folks do walkthroughs. They didn't pay this month, and then they bounced a few days ago."
16-09-2019T21:25:16,Dadrobit,Hopefully their deposit covers the cost of repairs.
16-09-2019T21:25:46,Dadrobit,"They might file a claim, but that costs money and 99.9% of the time nothing ever comes of it."
16-09-2019T21:26:23,CrRAR,Not when you have picture evidence of before/afters.
16-09-2019T21:26:28,CrRAR,indeed
16-09-2019T21:27:34,Dadrobit,The worst is that they broke the marble top of the kitchen counter. That shit's expensive...
16-09-2019T21:29:46,CrRAR,Like even... how? That's absurd.
16-09-2019T21:30:38,Dadrobit,"Dunno, snapped the shit out of it."
16-09-2019T21:31:56,CrRAR,"For next tenants: ""You'll get formica and you'll LIKE IT!"""
16-09-2019T21:32:38,Dadrobit,Was halfway considering being the next tenant myself.
16-09-2019T21:32:59,Dadrobit,"More expensive, but it's a really really nice place."
16-09-2019T21:33:18,Dadrobit,Or at least it was.
16-09-2019T21:33:38,CrRAR,yeah
16-09-2019T21:34:02,CrRAR,Another opportunity to customize I guess.
16-09-2019T21:34:33,CrRAR,"doing and redoing does get old though, no need for hassle at all."
16-09-2019T21:34:42,Dadrobit,It's the same 2 bed one bath which is my current place. But this other has a rec room as well and a walk in closet.
16-09-2019T21:35:05,Dadrobit,Extra $100 a month though.
16-09-2019T21:36:08,CrRAR,"Nice, extra creature comforts."
16-09-2019T21:36:37,Dadrobit,Heck yeah
16-09-2019T21:39:14,CrRAR,Master bath?
16-09-2019T21:39:30,Dadrobit,"No, just one bath."
16-09-2019T21:39:51,CrRAR,ah still cool
16-09-2019T21:39:52,Dadrobit,"Community, it's in a hallway."
16-09-2019T21:40:02,CrRAR,gotcha
16-09-2019T22:48:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"if someone had a duel wheeled truck, what would happen to the tires if they parked with only one of two of the back tires on a curb and the others on the ground?"
16-09-2019T23:20:50,Dadrobit,"Nothing, it just sits on one wheel. Unless it's under a tremendous load."
16-09-2019T23:21:33,Dadrobit,Tires are unbelievably strong in terms of vertical pressures.
16-09-2019T23:22:20,Dadrobit,It would have to be waaaay over inflated and be carrying a supremely heavy load to blow a tire
16-09-2019T23:28:43,AspiringNoodle,...the amount of luck I have is insane
16-09-2019T23:28:52,AspiringNoodle,"Or is it?  Time will tell, haha"
16-09-2019T23:29:14,AspiringNoodle,How has everyone's day been? :D
16-09-2019T23:29:21,AspiringNoodle,"And sorry to hear about the rental, Dad :c"
