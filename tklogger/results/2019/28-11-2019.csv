28-11-2019T00:01:55,AspiringNoodle,I feel bad :c
28-11-2019T00:02:11,AspiringNoodle,Worked 5.5 hours today.  Went to a competitor convenience store to grab dinner
28-11-2019T00:02:55,AspiringNoodle,"Saw that the MTO was still open, and I ordered some stuff, even though the store was packed.  Took the 2 employees in the food area 40 minutes to finally get through the queue and finish my order"
28-11-2019T00:03:27,AspiringNoodle,I have contributed to the working of employees on a holiday :ptv-whiny:
28-11-2019T00:28:09,JojoF2415,Finally I get to draw
28-11-2019T00:33:40,AspiringNoodle,I'm hoping to kill my demons this weekend and do the same :3
28-11-2019T00:33:46,AspiringNoodle,What are you gonna draw? :D
28-11-2019T00:37:22,SpazztasticKiwi,so what’d you do for thanksgiving Tom?
28-11-2019T00:37:29,SpazztasticKiwi,and don’t say work
28-11-2019T00:37:31,SpazztasticKiwi,or eat
28-11-2019T00:46:39,AspiringNoodle,He did both.  Calling it now. lol
28-11-2019T00:47:01,AspiringNoodle,Also slept and booped Nora on the nose :P
28-11-2019T01:19:26,JojoF2415,I drew my oc
28-11-2019T03:22:48,Dadrobit,"Oof, new processor aquired"
28-11-2019T03:23:08,Dadrobit,3800X Newegg Black Friday deal.
28-11-2019T03:24:36,Dadrobit,"No deals on the 3700X which was my original choice, but the 3800X got a price drop that made them equal in price. I'll take it I suppose lol"
28-11-2019T03:25:01,Dadrobit,Still a bit painful on the ol' wallet
28-11-2019T03:27:05,Dadrobit,"Also, some of my residents dropped by and gave me some food for the night. Love these guys :D"
28-11-2019T03:42:59,AspiringNoodle,"3800X at its normal price is a ""why does this exist?"" product"
28-11-2019T03:43:11,AspiringNoodle,3800X at 3700X price?  Nice small bump in performance c:
28-11-2019T03:45:51,Dadrobit,Essentially it's just a silicon lottery 3700X
28-11-2019T03:46:41,Dadrobit,"A bit higher power requirement, but I got a psu that'll be more than capable"
28-11-2019T03:47:42,Dadrobit,Only thing really is gonna be my thermals. Be quiet! isn't exactly thermal friendly with their cases lol
28-11-2019T03:48:21,Dadrobit,But more than anything I'm prioritizing zero db output
28-11-2019T03:50:53,Dadrobit,The Gamers Nexus review of the PB 600 where they found it quieter than literally a case with zero fans sold me
28-11-2019T03:53:23,SpazztasticKiwi,night Tom
28-11-2019T03:55:58,AspiringNoodle,My computer is preeeeeetty quiet
28-11-2019T03:56:13,AspiringNoodle,"Wish coil whine wasn't present, but apparently that's an issue with just about every single RTX card with a backplate"
28-11-2019T04:01:31,Dadrobit,That's something I'm concerned about 100%
28-11-2019T04:01:53,Dadrobit,The card is something I have the least control over
28-11-2019T04:02:41,Dadrobit,"Going with a triple fan gigabyte 2070 super. One pointed out coil whine, but the others found it dead silent"
28-11-2019T04:20:18,AspiringNoodle,You getting the gaming oc 2.5 slot card? :D
28-11-2019T04:31:33,Dadrobit,"Yeah, the Windforce one"
28-11-2019T04:31:51,Dadrobit,"$499, so MSRP"
28-11-2019T04:33:22,Dadrobit,"Sorry, not gaming oc, Windforce oc"
28-11-2019T04:34:57,Dadrobit,So a teensy bit slower clock
28-11-2019T04:46:30,Dadrobit,Made the decision a few days ago on an early BF sale. And GN literally an hour ago put out his year end review and specifically targeted that card. So feeling good about it atm.
28-11-2019T04:47:00,Dadrobit,Year end gpu round up review
28-11-2019T06:02:15,Dadrobit,"Huh, tornado warning in my area. First time I've ever seen that warning."
28-11-2019T06:03:53,Dadrobit,"Winds howling, rain is calling sideways, fun stuff."
28-11-2019T06:04:00,Dadrobit,Falling*

28-11-2019T15:00:39,JojoF2415,Hello. I went to Walmart and had forgotten it’s Black Friday
28-11-2019T15:07:19,AspiringNoodle,Was it bad?
28-11-2019T15:18:19,ThingsAreMoving,What's the damage?
28-11-2019T15:20:44,AspiringNoodle,Are we talking viral video of people waiting outside a mall on Black Friday bad
28-11-2019T15:20:50,AspiringNoodle,Or South Park Black Friday parody bad?
28-11-2019T15:21:59,ThingsAreMoving,Imho people working in reatil on black friday should be equipped with electric cattle prods. Just in case
28-11-2019T15:22:40,AspiringNoodle,Haha.  Imagine if the law required paying double-time on Black Friday ;)
28-11-2019T15:23:55,ThingsAreMoving,...it doesn't?
28-11-2019T15:23:58,ThingsAreMoving,wow
28-11-2019T15:26:45,AspiringNoodle,For federal holidays it's mandatory time-and-a-half
28-11-2019T15:26:53,AspiringNoodle,But Black Friday doesn't count as anything as far as I know
28-11-2019T15:27:28,AspiringNoodle,It's more or less a retail-created day of specials meant to help them make a huge chunk of their yearly profits
28-11-2019T16:10:59,JojoF2415,I failed making a knife out of aluminum. My piece of aluminum cracked and split into two.
28-11-2019T16:11:27,JojoF2415,I was making a mini knife but I didn’t heat it up correctly
28-11-2019T16:11:49,JojoF2415,I got two pieces of aluminum now
28-11-2019T16:11:56,ThingsAreMoving,aluminium is a poor material for knife making
28-11-2019T16:12:00,ThingsAreMoving,too soft
28-11-2019T16:22:15,JojoF2415,It’s just for fun
28-11-2019T16:22:52,JojoF2415,For decoration
28-11-2019T16:23:24,ThingsAreMoving,"I mean... it may be good for practice, but if you want to shape a knife out of aluminium you can just use a decent file and a hard knife to shave off some material"
28-11-2019T16:24:11,ThingsAreMoving,But even if you manage to sharpen it it won't hold it's edge for long. Also there's gonna be a lot of oxidation going on
28-11-2019T16:24:18,JojoF2415,I know
28-11-2019T16:26:41,ThingsAreMoving,do you have any pictures?
28-11-2019T16:28:27,JojoF2415,No
28-11-2019T16:29:07,ThingsAreMoving,"Shoot. Well, best of luck next time. It's a fun craft."
28-11-2019T16:30:12,JojoF2415,I doing homework right now. I not serious when I forge. The forge I have is too small and I don’t have a anvil nor a piece of steel
28-11-2019T16:31:19,JojoF2415,The only steel I have good access to is 1045. I don’t have quenching oil either
28-11-2019T16:42:43,JojoF2415,I’m not into forging right now. I just draw anime cartoons or Twokinds
28-11-2019T17:07:07,JojoF2415,It raining and hailing
28-11-2019T17:08:28,ThingsAreMoving,best weather
28-11-2019T17:08:57,JojoF2415,The hail stopped
28-11-2019T17:09:19,JojoF2415,It’s been so long since I’ve seen hail
28-11-2019T17:13:48,ThingsAreMoving,I'm enjoying the sight of heavy fog and frost outside

28-11-2019T19:25:49,AspiringNoodle,Cocaine :upside_down:
28-11-2019T19:42:52,ThingsAreMoving,"Did cocaine and speed. If you treat it as a one time booster and don't overdo it you can extend your free time, but you'll have to sleep those extra hours eventually."
28-11-2019T19:43:20,unsteddyphoenix,Remember kids; only occassionally snort coke
28-11-2019T19:43:27,ThingsAreMoving,Drugs are not inherently bad. It's just the stupidity of people who overuse and misuse them what's bad.
28-11-2019T19:43:42,unsteddyphoenix,not wrong tbh
28-11-2019T19:44:11,ThingsAreMoving,"also, hello unfteddy ^^"

28-11-2019T19:48:21,ThingsAreMoving,can't be bothered to get more
28-11-2019T19:48:41,ThingsAreMoving,even then it was 1 gram used over the course of like 8 months
28-11-2019T19:49:06,unsteddyphoenix,damn. Always gotta keep some for emergencies.
28-11-2019T19:49:38,ThingsAreMoving,If I wanted to take part in every friday stream from start to finish I'd become a junkie
28-11-2019T19:49:49,ThingsAreMoving,no matter how cautious I'd be with it
28-11-2019T19:53:43,unsteddyphoenix,arguably worth it

28-11-2019T21:17:46,HoverdudeXL,Oh
28-11-2019T21:18:40,tehbear,humans are weird. sometimes we like being alone. then we need to be with or flock. even if were not aware of it.
28-11-2019T21:19:05,HoverdudeXL,Yea
28-11-2019T21:19:30,tehbear,"i had issues with depression a lot in the past. and all i needed was to hang out with some close friends or family. then, other times its good to be alone."
28-11-2019T21:20:12,tehbear,"i feel almost like school should have a basic ""how to human"" course :P"
28-11-2019T21:22:00,SageSaga,that's what life is- its just sad so many people fail it
28-11-2019T21:22:08,BadFoMo,"I want to make a joke about Aliens, but I can't think of one."
28-11-2019T21:22:19,HoverdudeXL,Oh well
28-11-2019T21:23:00,SageSaga,thats not a bad idea for one of those little viral comics
28-11-2019T21:23:23,SageSaga,Aliens start a support group class for learning how to be human but humans keep joining
28-11-2019T21:23:41,Sclimshady,XD

28-11-2019T21:23:51,Sclimshady,Need a third comic Sage?
28-11-2019T21:24:06,tehbear,classic humans. keep joining courses they should excel at
28-11-2019T21:24:10,SageSaga,already have a third and 4th
28-11-2019T21:24:29,BadFoMo,"""Hi, fellow Human! ...I eat food!"""
28-11-2019T21:24:55,HoverdudeXL,Lol
28-11-2019T21:25:03,SageSaga,i was thinking about it being more serious
28-11-2019T21:25:11,HoverdudeXL,Oh.
28-11-2019T21:25:29,tehbear,Hi. If Im stuck with you 100% of the time i will go insane. If im alone 100% of the time I will also go insane.
28-11-2019T21:25:31,BadFoMo,Oh... I have little to no ideas then.
28-11-2019T21:25:38,SageSaga,"like - ""I am fellow human that likes to pet the 4 legged animals because it makes me feel warm inside"" Human - ""I am here because i need to learn how to feel again"""
28-11-2019T21:27:32,tehbear,"humans are like wolves. if you become to friendly, they will kill you. if youre hostile, they will also kill you."
28-11-2019T21:28:57,tehbear,gotta find the sweet spot.
28-11-2019T21:29:22,SageSaga,kill them first?
28-11-2019T21:29:39,tehbear,but then you will be alone. and you loose.
28-11-2019T21:29:54,SageSaga,i'd rather be alone than dead
28-11-2019T21:30:44,tehbear,"if youre alone, you will suffer the long and painful death. and go insane like Tom Hansk in Cast Away. Unless a ship finds you."
28-11-2019T21:30:54,SageSaga,im ok with that
28-11-2019T21:31:19,tehbear,Wilson!
28-11-2019T21:32:27,tehbear,I cant believe Castaway is a movie from 2000. Feels like another life when I first saw it
28-11-2019T21:32:48,tehbear,and The Matrix is from 1999
28-11-2019T21:32:49,TeapotOfDoom,Good evening folks!
28-11-2019T21:33:06,tehbear,for some reason Castaway feels older than The Matrix to me
28-11-2019T21:33:08,TeapotOfDoom,I should not be awake yet here i am....

28-11-2019T21:34:32,SageSaga,i strongly disagree with that

28-11-2019T21:35:05,TeapotOfDoom,Dnd session took a bit longer then anticipated
28-11-2019T21:35:08,SageSaga,you break everything down far enough and everything looks the same- but doing that is undermining everything that makes life interesting
28-11-2019T21:35:26,TeapotOfDoom,Well said sage
28-11-2019T21:35:35,tehbear,I actually agree Sage. Its easy to be deconstructivist

28-11-2019T21:37:06,tehbear,true. nothing happens in a vacuum.
28-11-2019T21:37:13,SageSaga,influence does not make something not original

28-11-2019T21:40:09,ZRO4825,"Well, that and there's so much out there these days that you can take damned near anything and compare it to something else at a base enough level for people to be like ""Oh that's been done before."""

28-11-2019T22:09:12,SageSaga,it looked better when i did it the first time
28-11-2019T22:09:26,Titanarisium,G'day everyone
28-11-2019T22:10:20,AnuSekaniArt,"Am alright Rima, just taking a chill tonight"
28-11-2019T22:10:28,AnuSekaniArt,How are you?
28-11-2019T22:10:30,AnuSekaniArt,Hello Titan
28-11-2019T22:11:08,Titanarisium,Hallo Anu
28-11-2019T22:11:17,RimaDraws,i got accused of art theft on amino but i proved them wrong. not going into the gorey details but long story short make sure you post WIPs and credit your final piece or they will accuse
28-11-2019T22:11:28,RimaDraws,but other than that i am great
28-11-2019T22:12:22,SageSaga,im not drawing Leviathan again
28-11-2019T22:13:29,Titanarisium,Who's Leviathan
28-11-2019T22:14:19,SageSaga,an ancient sea dragon mentioned in lots of fiction
28-11-2019T22:14:31,RimaDraws,giant sea dragon
28-11-2019T22:14:39,MoonDance,Big water boy
28-11-2019T22:14:52,Titanarisium,Oh that.
28-11-2019T22:14:59,Sclimshady,Really good creature cards in MTG
28-11-2019T22:15:10,SageSaga,its not that good in MTG
28-11-2019T22:15:23,Sclimshady,"Fine,  kinda good"
28-11-2019T22:15:36,Sclimshady,I dont play my Leviathan deck that much
28-11-2019T22:15:41,AnuSekaniArt,"*checks brother's Christmas wishlist, sees booster boxes of latest MTG sets*'"
28-11-2019T22:15:48,Sclimshady,Mostly in casual games
28-11-2019T22:15:52,AnuSekaniArt,Welp XD
28-11-2019T22:16:21,Sclimshady,My red blue combo deck is much better anyways
28-11-2019T22:17:44,AnuSekaniArt,You keep up with the latest sets Sclim?
28-11-2019T22:18:14,Sclimshady,"Not recently,  Im happy with my deck as is"
28-11-2019T22:18:27,Sclimshady,Can go infinite turn 3 in commander
28-11-2019T22:18:44,AnuSekaniArt,"Yeah same. Haven't done much since Hour of Devestation, and last set I bought was Core 2019"
28-11-2019T22:18:55,AnuSekaniArt,*Devastation
28-11-2019T22:19:06,AnuSekaniArt,Just got too expensive for me
28-11-2019T22:19:47,Sclimshady,"It relies a bit too much on mana rocks were I to go against a competent counter build,  but its enough"
28-11-2019T22:19:49,AspiringNoodle,^ TCG's in a nutshell
28-11-2019T22:20:06,AspiringNoodle,Spend all the money as new cards are released in order to stay relevant
28-11-2019T22:20:15,AnuSekaniArt,I've heard LCGs are much better in that regard
28-11-2019T22:20:31,SageSaga,when in doubt- Panharmonicon
28-11-2019T22:21:25,Sclimshady,I think myForce of will is the most expensive one I have
28-11-2019T22:21:35,IronHorseComics,howdy folks
28-11-2019T22:21:44,Sclimshady,"Kinda want volcanic island, but hey"
28-11-2019T22:22:07,IronHorseComics,got the new Star Wars game
28-11-2019T22:22:12,IronHorseComics,I am loving it so far
28-11-2019T22:23:26,Sclimshady,Hi Iron
28-11-2019T22:23:49,AnuSekaniArt,Hey Iron
28-11-2019T22:23:54,AnuSekaniArt,And oh you play Force of Will too? Nice X3
28-11-2019T22:24:08,Sclimshady,Force is the best turn 0 counter
28-11-2019T22:24:19,Sclimshady,gotta stomp out those combo pieces
28-11-2019T22:24:25,AnuSekaniArt,Dabbled in it but their J-Ruler distribution is kinda turning me off of going in hardcore
28-11-2019T22:24:32,IronHorseComics,eh? I was talking about Fallen Order
28-11-2019T22:24:50,AnuSekaniArt,We're talking about Force of Will. I was replying to Shady earlier XD
28-11-2019T22:24:59,AnuSekaniArt,"But ye, good to hear you're liking Fallen Order so far Iron"
28-11-2019T22:25:10,IronHorseComics,got to drive an AT-AT
28-11-2019T22:25:28,IronHorseComics,which was fun until am imperial ship crashed into me after I shot it down
28-11-2019T22:25:29,SageSaga,spoilers!
28-11-2019T22:25:44,IronHorseComics,"pssh, it's so early in the game the warning's not necessary"
28-11-2019T22:26:19,IronHorseComics,besides there are far more important things to not spoil
28-11-2019T22:26:36,SageSaga,You dont get to decide whats worth spoiling
28-11-2019T22:28:25,RimaDraws,iron behave
28-11-2019T22:28:48,IronHorseComics,"oh fine, wasn't going to go into much else anyway"
28-11-2019T22:30:01,SpazztasticKiwi,thanksgiving leftovers
28-11-2019T22:30:24,AnuSekaniArt,The best :P
28-11-2019T22:30:33,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s like thanksgiving 2: return of the gobbles
28-11-2019T22:31:01,tehbear,the hunger: returns
28-11-2019T22:31:02,RimaDraws,return of heart attack city
28-11-2019T22:32:15,SageSaga,the only things left over from Thanksgiving here are the desserts and i cant eat those
28-11-2019T22:33:05,IronHorseComics,then it really would be return to heart attack city
28-11-2019T22:34:15,tehbear,Thanksgiving 2: The fight for scraps
28-11-2019T22:34:51,tehbear,when youre tired of cooking and whatevers left must last for days
28-11-2019T22:38:26,tehbear,I wish I hadnt thrown away the old 286 i had as a kid
28-11-2019T22:38:39,tehbear,so many old DOS games i cant remember the name of
28-11-2019T22:39:22,tehbear,CGA color palette
28-11-2019T22:41:12,tehbear,... nostalgia is one hell of a drug
28-11-2019T22:42:40,tehbear,I remember Digger. 1983 windmill software
28-11-2019T22:42:52,tehbear,still an excellent game today
28-11-2019T22:43:37,SageSaga,Castle Wolfenstein
28-11-2019T22:43:50,tehbear,the 286 didt have that. but it had 3D pacman
28-11-2019T22:44:01,tehbear,"with simple line drawings of walls, dots and ghosts"
28-11-2019T22:44:49,SageSaga,Castle Wolfenstien was from 1981 on the Commodore 64
28-11-2019T22:46:21,tehbear,aha. I was thinking of Wolf3D. Completed that game during a cabin trip on an old laptop with LCD screen back in late 90s
28-11-2019T22:46:28,tehbear,mein leben!
28-11-2019T22:46:44,tehbear,sound fx are burnt into my psyche
28-11-2019T22:46:56,SageSaga,after Castle Wolfenstien was Beyond Castle Wolfenstein
28-11-2019T22:47:12,SageSaga,i think Wolfenstien 3d was after that?
28-11-2019T22:47:34,SageSaga,though technically there was nothing 3D about that game
28-11-2019T22:47:37,tehbear,yes. wolf3d was released in 1992 or 93
28-11-2019T22:48:22,tehbear,"wolf3d did raycasting, and had perspective, so you could argue it was technically 3d, albeid not 6 degrees of freedom"
28-11-2019T22:49:17,tehbear,"if it makes to call it 2 DOF. xz plane rotation, and z plane translation."
28-11-2019T22:49:29,tehbear,like mode 7 on the SNES
28-11-2019T22:49:35,SageSaga,you cant argue raycasting is technically 3D when technically it isn't at all
28-11-2019T22:49:52,tehbear,point
28-11-2019T22:50:49,tehbear,it was more immersive than commander keen and super mario bros at least.
28-11-2019T22:51:08,tehbear,and far less likely to be approved by parents
28-11-2019T22:51:32,SageSaga,how dare a parent doesnt approve of the slaughter of nazis!
28-11-2019T22:51:55,Ordithus,"Ok, finally back.  Got a fire started :fire: :csagesaga-kaylinheart:"
28-11-2019T22:52:24,AnuSekaniArt,Nice!
28-11-2019T22:52:31,tehbear,what kind of a fire?
28-11-2019T22:52:35,AnuSekaniArt,:csagesaga-c3:
28-11-2019T22:52:39,Sclimshady,The hot kind
28-11-2019T22:52:41,Ordithus,Fireplace fire
28-11-2019T22:52:44,Ordithus,Of the wood
28-11-2019T22:52:52,SageSaga,"A 6 Year old - ""Father, you must let me kill Nazis because society cannot tolerate the intolerant to remain a society"""
28-11-2019T22:53:00,Ordithus,It took soooo much effort to get going
28-11-2019T22:53:16,tehbear,Sage: haha
28-11-2019T22:53:17,Sclimshady,"Wow, kids say the darndest things"
28-11-2019T22:54:07,tehbear,Ordit: use newspaper and a blowing-thingy
28-11-2019T22:54:35,tehbear,the thingy you always see in 1920s cartoones for gags
28-11-2019T22:54:36,SageSaga,there should be a reddit for kids trying to convince their parents to let them do things- so a kid puts his request up and people help come up with reasons to use
28-11-2019T22:55:05,Sclimshady,"There probably is, Reddit has everything"
28-11-2019T22:55:25,tehbear,sounds like the Nintendo switch game: Mom hid my videogame
28-11-2019T22:55:56,SageSaga,"""My father wont allow me to play Baseball with my friends"" ""What's your dad like?"" ""He's an army vet""  ""Explain to him that hand eye coronation is vital for military service"""
28-11-2019T22:56:37,Sclimshady,"If you can throw a ball, you can throw a grenade"
28-11-2019T22:56:49,tehbear,how can you not be allowed to play baseball?
28-11-2019T22:57:03,Sclimshady,"Also, grats on the kingship hand eye"
28-11-2019T22:57:15,Sclimshady,Or queen ship
28-11-2019T22:57:18,SageSaga,"one kid gets his head split open by a thrown ball and all the parents are like ""not my child!"""
28-11-2019T22:57:56,RedDragonSyndicate,heya
28-11-2019T22:58:02,tehbear,this is why you have more than 1 child
28-11-2019T22:58:14,SageSaga,yo Red
28-11-2019T22:58:16,Ordithus,hi red
28-11-2019T22:58:32,FoxxTrotter,"Hiya, Red."
28-11-2019T22:58:40,SageSaga,"""Father? Why was i born?"" ""In case your older brother dies"""
28-11-2019T22:58:58,tehbear,"come to think of it... my parent were always worried, but never said no to anything. i was just afraid to not get their approval"
28-11-2019T22:59:14,tehbear,ive played with gasoline and blowtorches since 10 years old
28-11-2019T22:59:29,tehbear,"... but my parents didnt know, and didnt need to know of that :P"
28-11-2019T23:00:02,SageSaga,im telling
28-11-2019T23:00:10,Ordithus,You wouldn't
28-11-2019T23:00:25,tehbear,plz no !
28-11-2019T23:00:49,IronHorseComics,"too late, you're already dead"
28-11-2019T23:00:55,IronHorseComics,er...grounded
28-11-2019T23:01:50,tehbear,hmmm. i should tell these stories at christmas
28-11-2019T23:02:19,tehbear,sometimes i wonder how im even alive
28-11-2019T23:02:52,tehbear,sorry. tired and getting to edgy
28-11-2019T23:03:00,tehbear,i should go to sleep
28-11-2019T23:07:50,IronHorseComics,I should too...
28-11-2019T23:08:29,tehbear,I started listening to a stream of music and now im too much in the flow
28-11-2019T23:09:45,tehbear,music is too good
28-11-2019T23:12:51,tehbear,"Man... the amount of crazy things i did with motorcycles, BB guns, gasoline, blowtorches, tractors, 220v electric blankets, fireworks, chemistry sets, cars on fields, burning down sheds, sledge hammers, throwing axes, and im ashamed of violent games..."
28-11-2019T23:13:09,tehbear,before i was 16.

28-11-2019T23:13:26,SageSaga,gnight Iron
28-11-2019T23:13:27,tehbear,Good night IronHorse!
28-11-2019T23:16:55,tehbear,Ive come to realize I have not changed as a person since i was a kid
28-11-2019T23:16:57,Ordithus,night Iron
28-11-2019T23:18:28,tehbear,"but if my current self travelled back in time, that 16 year old would be somewhat disappoined... and impressed at the same time."
28-11-2019T23:18:33,Ordithus,Nyna is doubtful of something
28-11-2019T23:19:24,Sclimshady,Ever the skeptic

28-11-2019T23:22:14,Ordithus,I think it best to at least know the name before loving something or someone
28-11-2019T23:22:57,SageSaga,that means demons cant know love without enslavement
28-11-2019T23:24:33,Sclimshady,Hi Mihari o/

28-11-2019T23:44:07,tehbear,fallout is my favourite video game series. started playing FO2
28-11-2019T23:44:27,TheFreindlyDeathclaw,FO3 was my first fallout
28-11-2019T23:44:44,tehbear,didnt get the turnbased mechanics first time and gave it away to a friend who later showed me how good it was
28-11-2019T23:44:45,BadFoMo,@TheFreindlyDeathclaw Same.
28-11-2019T23:44:55,TheFreindlyDeathclaw,Wish I hadn't lost my Platinum coin
28-11-2019T23:46:01,tehbear,the fallouts after 2 didnt have the same humour or immersive role playing where your choices actually have imapct
28-11-2019T23:46:05,tehbear,but still fun game
28-11-2019T23:46:13,TheFreindlyDeathclaw,that came with the New Vegas special edition
28-11-2019T23:46:24,Ordithus,"3 and NV were fun, haven't played the others"
28-11-2019T23:46:40,TheFreindlyDeathclaw,have you played outer worlds?
28-11-2019T23:46:45,Ordithus,The music in both was fantastic
28-11-2019T23:46:49,tehbear,"there was also Fallout Tactics, but that was meh"

28-11-2019T23:47:16,tehbear,Mark  Morgans music is amazing for FO1 and 2
28-11-2019T23:47:44,tehbear,i think Jeremy Soule made music for FO3? at least he did for Bethsedas Elderscrolls 3
28-11-2019T23:47:58,tehbear,and Shiny's Giants: Citizen Kabuto
28-11-2019T23:48:10,BadFoMo,I've played 3 and NV /a lot/; played 1 a little. ...I think I'll leave the 2D games to Oxhorn to play.
28-11-2019T23:48:38,tehbear,no. They were named Planet Moon .. the Shiny team made MDK 1 and 2
28-11-2019T23:48:41,AspiringNoodle,Bethesda gonna need to watch themselves :P
28-11-2019T23:48:51,BadFoMo,*1 and 2 a little.
28-11-2019T23:49:16,tehbear,"Fallout 1 is super easy, with steal skill you can get all the equipment"
28-11-2019T23:49:34,tehbear,FO2 is hard. Like life itself.
28-11-2019T23:49:40,tehbear,And full of bugs.
28-11-2019T23:49:50,AspiringNoodle,Fallout 1 had one of the best secrets / realistic stat systems ever xD
