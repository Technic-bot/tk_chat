14-06-2019T00:00:02,ZRO4825,My only guess would be someone who doesn't understand how it works.
14-06-2019T00:00:08,ZRO4825,"Or a terribly coded bot, lol"
14-06-2019T00:00:38,Dadrobit,"To get access to the locked off content and then bring the ""abnormal charges"" to the attention of their bank so they can get it refunded."
14-06-2019T00:00:49,Bgrmystr2,Probably what dadrobit said
14-06-2019T00:00:54,FoxxTrotter,"I'm off to bed. G'night, everyone. :0)"
14-06-2019T00:01:03,Ordithus,night foxx
14-06-2019T00:01:10,MarvTheHugPharaoh,nighty night foxx
14-06-2019T00:01:14,Bgrmystr2,pretty sure there's bots that do that kind of thing.
14-06-2019T00:01:18,PurpleLemons,nini foxx
14-06-2019T00:01:33,unsteddyphoenix,niight
14-06-2019T00:01:46,SageSaga,well that doesnt work Dadrobit because it doesnt charge each time and there is no locked off content
14-06-2019T00:01:49,Dadrobit,o/ foxx
14-06-2019T00:03:56,Dadrobit,"Could be stolen credit info and the new holder is testing the level of monitoring the old holder and their bank does? See if the card gets declined after abnormal usage and if it stays open, then they go in for the kill."
14-06-2019T00:04:20,SageSaga,but there is no charging of a card
14-06-2019T00:04:49,SageSaga,the card is charged once the first time- all these other times its not
14-06-2019T00:05:55,Dadrobit,Maybe they don't know that?
14-06-2019T00:06:28,SageSaga,"if you do this it tells you ""you've already paid this patreon for the month at that tier so you wont be charged again till next month"""
14-06-2019T00:06:57,Ordithus,maybe they're just really really indecisive
14-06-2019T00:09:15,Dadrobit,Maybe the bank is notified of discontinued/reinstated subscriptions as well that they can use? Or are they not signing up for a subscription model?
14-06-2019T00:09:57,SageSaga,it's patreon so they dont make any charges once a charge is made unless the amount changes- and they never do
14-06-2019T00:10:03,ZRO4825,No reason the bank would be notified. It's not being charged anything o_o;
14-06-2019T00:10:42,Dadrobit,"Eh, I got nothing."
14-06-2019T00:10:56,SageSaga,all it really does is send me an email... every time... saying someone new has joined my patreon- and its the same bloody person every day
14-06-2019T00:11:00,Ordithus,How long until Maddie notices Karen is in her bubble
14-06-2019T00:12:52,CrRAR,When safety is achieved.

14-06-2019T00:21:46,SageSaga,ya know- FF8 was a pretty bad game in terms of story- but it's systems and art were pretty cool... i think im gonna get the remaster
14-06-2019T00:22:13,FloofyCat,In Cyberpunk 2077 I wonder how many final fantasy games there would be
14-06-2019T00:22:13,SageSaga,also i can seem my GF in a higher resolution

14-06-2019T00:23:33,CrRAR,I always like remasters from the standpoint of it's a 2nd chance for the designers to express what they were trying to achieve despite technical limitations.

14-06-2019T00:24:10,Ordithus,The FF7 remake may be really interesting.  The original wasn't quite complete
14-06-2019T00:24:18,CrRAR,mmm
14-06-2019T00:24:23,Masterzooka,anyone played the remastered version of fable? it’s amazing.

14-06-2019T00:50:15,FloofyCat,I hate E3 bit learning that Keanu wasn't just making a token appearance and is actually in the game was awesome
14-06-2019T00:50:33,Dadrobit,"Can confirm, I am not likely a robot."
14-06-2019T00:50:37,FloofyCat,"I didn't know you could see Patreon emails, huh."
14-06-2019T00:50:44,Ordithus,"Eh, you already know where I live"

14-06-2019T00:51:31,unsteddyphoenix,He never sleeps
14-06-2019T00:51:38,FloofyCat,Tom is still up from all the coffee.
14-06-2019T00:51:41,Ordithus,:robot: <-- Tom
14-06-2019T00:52:08,FloofyCat,Tom shares a lot of his genome with the genome of coffee plants.

14-06-2019T00:52:15,mingun,"Verification purposes? I'm wondering, is the Patreon account not enough?"
14-06-2019T00:52:30,Dadrobit,"Wait, is Bane still culturally relevant?"
14-06-2019T00:52:40,unsteddyphoenix,always
14-06-2019T00:52:55,FloofyCat,"I dunno, if you get the link to the suggestions, you could put some other patron's name down?"
14-06-2019T00:52:56,Masterzooka,hey remember when wtf boom was still a relevant meme?

14-06-2019T00:53:06,Masterzooka,oh gtg

14-06-2019T00:56:19,SageSaga,so im thinking about not getting pokemon SnS depending on if they allow all of my favorite pokemon- if they are missing one- im probably gonna pass
14-06-2019T00:56:27,AspiringNoodle,"Not joking, this new Nibbly emote is gonna destroy the world.  I just know it."
14-06-2019T00:56:44,AspiringNoodle,"Also, Wooloo might bring me BACK to pokemon :P"
14-06-2019T00:56:52,AspiringNoodle,Wooloo is too pure for this world.
14-06-2019T00:57:16,LannAF,jojo was in tents
14-06-2019T00:57:21,FloofyCat,The only thing I know about Pokemon is there's a sheep called Wooloo now and its adorable and Mareep is obsolete.
14-06-2019T00:57:26,Dadrobit,"Nope, not getting the new one. Was already on the fence about it, not even having a National Dex is a complete turn off."
14-06-2019T00:57:31,AspiringNoodle,What Floofy said
14-06-2019T00:57:40,AspiringNoodle,"Move over Mareep, we has new best sheep."
14-06-2019T00:57:58,SageSaga,im fine with the no nation dex so long as the pokemon cut are ones I dont like anyways
14-06-2019T00:57:59,AspiringNoodle,"Also, move over Eevee / Pikachu, you've been replaced.  WOOLOO FOR POKEMON MASCOT!!!"

14-06-2019T00:58:03,PurpleLemons,wb Lann
14-06-2019T00:58:07,SageSaga,but in generally it does piss me off
14-06-2019T00:58:08,LannAF,wb
14-06-2019T00:58:10,LannAF,wait
14-06-2019T00:58:11,LannAF,yes hi
14-06-2019T00:58:17,FloofyCat,Wooloo sounds like WOLOLO so I want Age of Empires II conversions to... sheep-dom?
14-06-2019T00:58:19,ZRO4825,"ahhh, pokemon...where I have no room to speak because I haven't played the games since Silver. :joy:"
14-06-2019T00:58:30,AspiringNoodle,"ZRO, I'm kinda the same ^^;"
14-06-2019T00:58:34,FloofyCat,I never watched or played Pokemon :(
14-06-2019T00:58:49,AspiringNoodle,I stopped after Black and White.  And I NEVER got into the reboots.
14-06-2019T00:58:54,FloofyCat,Wish I did
14-06-2019T00:59:02,PurpleLemons,"Lann, what's your favorite stand?"
14-06-2019T00:59:19,AspiringNoodle,"Floofy, you wouldn't want to play the original pokemon :ptv-laugh:"
14-06-2019T00:59:29,AspiringNoodle,I dont' think it was until Gen 3 that they added some major QoL features.
14-06-2019T00:59:39,Dadrobit,Sun and Moon were just not fun for me. And the new beach ball pokeball super size me bull just looks... Bleh...
14-06-2019T00:59:53,AspiringNoodle,"As a child, it was definitely a mind-blowing experience.  But thinking back on it, man was it not a fluid experience ^^;"
14-06-2019T01:00:37,Dadrobit,Only reason I was even mildly interested was for the sword dog so I could name it Did like every other person on the internet.
14-06-2019T01:00:46,Dadrobit,Sif*
14-06-2019T01:01:13,SageSaga,"i think the only main pokemon games i havent played and finished were- Pokemon Ultra Sun and Moon,  and Leaf Green..."
14-06-2019T01:01:13,AspiringNoodle,"I wonder if in the future, they'll release a console-specific Pokemon game called Pokémon Chronicles.  It's schtick being that it contains EVERY SINGLE HANDHELD POKEMON GAME EVER."
14-06-2019T01:01:33,AspiringNoodle,"That would be a ""TAKE ALL MY MONEY"" situation."
14-06-2019T01:01:53,FloofyCat,Future? What future?
14-06-2019T01:02:09,AspiringNoodle,The only future worth living for
14-06-2019T01:02:16,Bgrmystr2,"There's this thing called Pokemon 3D, Noodle."
14-06-2019T01:02:27,LannAF,sorry I went afk
14-06-2019T01:02:35,LannAF,um
14-06-2019T01:02:40,AspiringNoodle,My most recent handheld would be the DS Lite
14-06-2019T01:02:48,LannAF,tossup between crazy diamond and star plat
14-06-2019T01:02:49,AspiringNoodle,And that thing's kinda in storage
14-06-2019T01:02:55,LannAF,"eh, crazy diamond"
14-06-2019T01:03:01,PurpleLemons,:cpurplelemons-pika: yare yare daze
14-06-2019T01:03:17,AspiringNoodle,"Still, just think about it"
14-06-2019T01:03:19,Bgrmystr2,"P3D is basically what you want. It's a 1st person view of how you'd play the game, and they're adding all the pokemon and all the areas over time."
14-06-2019T01:03:40,PurpleLemons,strong contenders Lann :ok_hand:
14-06-2019T01:03:48,Xalrog,Hello purple:lemon:
14-06-2019T01:03:56,PurpleLemons,hi Xal o/
14-06-2019T01:04:19,AspiringNoodle,What about storylines? :)
14-06-2019T01:04:23,SageSaga,my favorite Stand is my Stand
14-06-2019T01:04:50,AspiringNoodle,"Also, since it's an indie / fan title, I worry about it.  It'll likely get struck down later on."
14-06-2019T01:05:06,PurpleLemons,is it a $999 apple stand? :cpurplelemons-eyes-0:
14-06-2019T01:05:12,Dadrobit,"Yeah, C&D inbound"
14-06-2019T01:05:23,AspiringNoodle,That said... it looks so cool ;_;
14-06-2019T01:05:29,AspiringNoodle,"Nintendo, plz hire them."
14-06-2019T01:05:31,Bgrmystr2,"I think it's based on Silver / Gold storyline, but they've been working on going to other areas besides kanto / johto"
14-06-2019T01:06:08,AspiringNoodle,I have fond childhood memories of my parents getting me a pokemon game before a long trip.
14-06-2019T01:06:21,AspiringNoodle,And then the first night I get my starter to level 30 within the first few hours xD
14-06-2019T01:07:01,SageSaga,pokemon Sun and Moon were the first pokemon games besides Gen 1 that i 100%ed
14-06-2019T01:07:45,AspiringNoodle,"I should check on my copy of Black and White, make sure my data hasn't corrupted"
14-06-2019T01:08:02,Dadrobit,I really wasn't a fan of that gen. So much time was spent on dragging the player around.
14-06-2019T01:08:04,AspiringNoodle,Got a Zorou through the event and I love it.
14-06-2019T01:08:09,FloofyCat,"Wait, the apple stand itself actually costs $999?"
14-06-2019T01:08:10,AspiringNoodle,Zorua*
14-06-2019T01:08:14,FloofyCat,I thought it was just a joke?
14-06-2019T01:08:17,AspiringNoodle,"And yes, the STAND costs $1000"
14-06-2019T01:08:23,FloofyCat,Like... the metal stand?
14-06-2019T01:08:27,AspiringNoodle,But $999 for marketing bs
14-06-2019T01:08:34,AspiringNoodle,"Gotta have them 9's, yo"
14-06-2019T01:08:45,SageSaga,it's actually 1099-1100 after tax
14-06-2019T01:08:48,FloofyCat,Whoever buys that deserves to be robbed of all their money
14-06-2019T01:08:50,FloofyCat,Oh come on!
14-06-2019T01:08:56,FloofyCat,And I know people will buy it!
14-06-2019T01:08:59,Dadrobit,And I never found a use for the super move thing that they had going on.
14-06-2019T01:09:10,FloofyCat,Someone will make a superior after-market stand for 5% of the damn price!
14-06-2019T01:09:20,AspiringNoodle,"From what I've read / watched, the monitor itself is actually somewhat worth the price, given its feature set.  But the money they're charging for the stand / vesa mount bring it back to ripoff territory..."
14-06-2019T01:09:34,AspiringNoodle,"And they've already done that, Floofy xD"
14-06-2019T01:09:52,AspiringNoodle,"$200 or something for a damn vesa mount, when you can buy them for $20"
14-06-2019T01:09:57,Dadrobit,"It's somewhat worth A* price, not THE* price."
14-06-2019T01:10:18,FloofyCat,There should be some sort of regulation to protect morons from wasting their money on a thousand dollar mount
14-06-2019T01:10:31,AspiringNoodle,"There is, it's called the free market"
14-06-2019T01:10:48,AspiringNoodle,And part of that market is the sheeple who blindly bend over and get effed in the A and ask for more
14-06-2019T01:10:58,AspiringNoodle,Because they can't bother to actually do research :/
14-06-2019T01:11:18,ZRO4825,"Or can't actually look at something and go ""Wow, this is totally not worth a thousand bucks..."""
14-06-2019T01:11:57,AspiringNoodle,"The Mac Pro *may* be worth it the next iteration, assuming Apple decides to use the obviously superior Ryzen platform :P"
14-06-2019T01:12:00,Dadrobit,"I watched that part of the showcase, even the Apple faithful gasped in horror at the price announcement. The dude on stage started stuttering and literally ran off the stage after his bit."
14-06-2019T01:12:34,SageSaga,for a thousand dollars it better adjust itself exactly how I want it
14-06-2019T01:12:39,AspiringNoodle,Nope
14-06-2019T01:12:53,AspiringNoodle,"It's sleak, slim, aesthetically pleasing, but rather plain."
14-06-2019T01:13:12,AspiringNoodle,And I think there is NO height / tilt adjustment
14-06-2019T01:13:34,SageSaga,uhh
14-06-2019T01:13:39,SageSaga,they show it doing that
14-06-2019T01:13:39,AspiringNoodle,"I lie, there is height adjustment, at least"
14-06-2019T01:13:40,SageSaga,so it does
14-06-2019T01:13:42,Dadrobit,It looks flimsy and has too many moving parts
14-06-2019T01:13:58,AspiringNoodle,"Okay, yeah, it does have everything."
14-06-2019T01:14:26,AspiringNoodle,And it does NOT look solid.  At least where the monitor is attached.
14-06-2019T01:15:24,AspiringNoodle,I feel sorry for humanity.  The apple fan bois and sheeple have let Apple get away with so much crap.  And those practices are slowly leaking out to other players in the market.
14-06-2019T01:15:47,AspiringNoodle,Apple is literally the LAST company they should be looking to emulate...
14-06-2019T01:15:59,FloofyCat,"I mean, with Apple's success..."
14-06-2019T01:16:00,SageSaga,they priced out a system to be as close as possible to it - and i think the entire system clone cost 3k
14-06-2019T01:16:26,AspiringNoodle,"It's ~$3,200 for the CPU, GPU, 32GB RAM, and 256GB SSD (HA!!!)"
14-06-2019T01:16:41,FloofyCat,"256GB SSD. $3,200."
14-06-2019T01:17:08,AspiringNoodle,"The power supply shouldn't be more than $200, the case fans more than $100 for all 3 (assuming premium pricing), and the motherboard... I don't know.  That looks more like a server board but it's completely custom."
14-06-2019T01:17:17,FloofyCat,"For $3,200 I want at least two TB of SSDs in RAID, whichever directly copies another drive"
14-06-2019T01:17:43,SageSaga,im saying the clone of the top of the line version was 3k
14-06-2019T01:17:49,SageSaga,their price was 6k
14-06-2019T01:17:50,FloofyCat,Oh
14-06-2019T01:17:53,FloofyCat,OH COME ON!
14-06-2019T01:17:59,SageSaga,so you are paying a 3k Apple tax
14-06-2019T01:18:29,FloofyCat,Geez! I'm not sure how you could even get to 3k even cloning that.
14-06-2019T01:18:34,AspiringNoodle,"I'm curious as to how they achieved that.  Supposedly the CPU, GPU, RAM and SSD are $3,200 alone, and that's market pricing."
14-06-2019T01:18:46,ZRO4825,O_o
14-06-2019T01:19:13,SageSaga,they used things as close as possible to get the same performance- not the exact same items
14-06-2019T01:19:24,AspiringNoodle,"Okay, that makes more sense."
14-06-2019T01:19:34,AspiringNoodle,"Also, Xeons are officially a ripoff at this point in time."
14-06-2019T01:19:37,FloofyCat,"Top of the line CPU + GPU okay sure that's 1.2k at the most, RAM I can see at 400 if you're going for like 128GB of something overpriced and 100 dollars for a 256GB SSD."
14-06-2019T01:19:53,AspiringNoodle,"If you REALLY need ECC memory support, AMD offers it up and down their entire product stack."
14-06-2019T01:20:33,AspiringNoodle,"And given the fact that they caught up with Intel's ST performance and are focusing on pumping out more cores, they're quickly obsolescing Xeons. Memory excluded."
14-06-2019T01:21:46,Dadrobit,The base model priced at 3k is still a sturdy workstation. 6k is just fucking stupid.
14-06-2019T01:22:14,AspiringNoodle,I saw speculation as to why they're charging 6k.  It's more of a marketing ploy than anything.
14-06-2019T01:22:28,Xalrog,niche product
14-06-2019T01:22:42,Dadrobit,"Yeah, they're marketing for Windows machines."
14-06-2019T01:23:16,AspiringNoodle,"The people who are willing to pay 6k for that are people looking for a status symbol, and have lots of money to blow.  The actual professionals who'd use it will pay for more expensive parts (where the apple tax will likely diminish drastically),"
14-06-2019T01:23:53,AspiringNoodle,"As for the rest of the regular joes, it's more of an enticement.  Dangling just far enough away for them to have hope of getting something like that, while pricing it such that not many people will actually buy the damn thing."
14-06-2019T01:24:44,SageSaga,did yall hear about that Mac book pro in the news recently?
14-06-2019T01:24:57,AspiringNoodle,DO NOT BUY
14-06-2019T01:25:02,Dadrobit,?
14-06-2019T01:25:27,SageSaga,"so they racked up over 10,000 dollars in repairs on this one Macbook pro"
14-06-2019T01:25:37,AspiringNoodle,...HOW
14-06-2019T01:25:53,AspiringNoodle,Seriously. HOW?!?
14-06-2019T01:25:55,SageSaga,the issue was when he turned it on - it seemed to boot but there was nothing on the screen
14-06-2019T01:25:55,Dadrobit,"Ohhh, I saw the headline, didn't find the time to read it though."
14-06-2019T01:26:10,SageSaga,so he took it to the Apple Care Genius bar and they did some testing
14-06-2019T01:26:19,SageSaga,ended up replacing the board inside it
14-06-2019T01:26:31,SageSaga,still didnt fix it- so they used a different board
14-06-2019T01:26:39,SageSaga,they replaced the entire thing several times
14-06-2019T01:26:45,Dadrobit,"Lemme guess, backlight connector was bent and slightly disconnected or something silly."
14-06-2019T01:26:51,AspiringNoodle,^
14-06-2019T01:26:57,SageSaga,silly but not that
14-06-2019T01:27:11,SageSaga,dimmer setting was set all the way down
14-06-2019T01:27:19,Xalrog,i knew it
14-06-2019T01:27:20,AspiringNoodle,Woooooooooooow xD
14-06-2019T01:27:32,Dadrobit,Jesus fuckin Christ
14-06-2019T01:27:39,AspiringNoodle,And that is why you don't let the backlight turn all the way off
14-06-2019T01:28:59,AspiringNoodle,"Still doesn't explain the $10,000 bit, though."
14-06-2019T01:29:41,Bgrmystr2,"because that's the price of apple's ""Repair"""
14-06-2019T01:29:45,Dadrobit,"""Sorry sir, but you didn't buy our protection plan, so you are responsible for the entire service cost"""
14-06-2019T01:29:54,SageSaga,they basically replaced everything in the system multiple times- its a mac book pro
14-06-2019T01:30:45,SageSaga,its already like a 4k product- if you replace it twice thats 8k  there + repair service costs
14-06-2019T01:30:59,AspiringNoodle,"...So let me get this straight, they replaced multiple system components multiple times, probably didn't bother to verify that the parts they used were functional, and charged for EVERYTHING?!?"
14-06-2019T01:31:03,FloofyCat,"Well yeah I agree with the status symbol thing, middle class people can usually afford to blow that kind of money unless they live some giant decadent caviar devouring lifestyle"
14-06-2019T01:31:10,Bgrmystr2,but he shouldn't have to pay for BOTH replacements.. otherwise he'd just buy a god damned new one for 4k.
14-06-2019T01:31:14,Bgrmystr2,that's retarded
14-06-2019T01:31:15,AspiringNoodle,"At this point, I'm an advocate for the government holding these shitty businesses accountable..."
14-06-2019T01:31:26,SageSaga,from what i understand he wasnt charged because it was all under warrenty
14-06-2019T01:31:27,Dadrobit,Did I mention I got to see an Apple store get robbed a few weeks back. Dude snipped off half a tables devices and bolted.
14-06-2019T01:31:42,Dadrobit,"Was some funny shit, no one else even noticed."
14-06-2019T01:31:44,SageSaga,"so Apple basically paid 10,000 dollars for a 0$ problem"
14-06-2019T01:31:47,AspiringNoodle,"That's be like taking your car in because the engine isn't working, they put in a new engine, that doesn't work, so they put in ANOTHER engine, and keep doing it until they figure out the issue, then charging for every single engine..."
14-06-2019T01:32:13,Xalrog,"some geniuses, huh ?"
14-06-2019T01:32:38,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I figured they'd eat the cost. Not doing so would be even more of a PR disaster."
14-06-2019T01:32:46,FloofyCat,Lets just vote for a politician to stop Apple from doing thi- Wait Mr. Politician what is that sack of money from Apple doing in your hand?
14-06-2019T01:32:48,AspiringNoodle,Seriously
14-06-2019T01:33:09,AspiringNoodle,Imagine if Apple just died.
14-06-2019T01:33:32,AspiringNoodle,"All servers and backup servers wiped. Physically destroyed.  All apple devices dead, unrepairable."
14-06-2019T01:33:39,SageSaga,"there is a reason why the first things in computer repair check lists are ""make sure its plugged in. make sure the power supply is turned on, make sure it's turned on"""
14-06-2019T01:33:52,AspiringNoodle,I don't think that's even the issue!
14-06-2019T01:34:16,AspiringNoodle,It's the fact that they'd charge you for the parts that they use in an *ATTEMPT* to fix the computer.  Even when the part doesn't even remain in the system in the end.
14-06-2019T01:34:34,Bgrmystr2,yeah that's stupid
14-06-2019T01:34:40,Bgrmystr2,"if you're paying for it, you better GET that part"
14-06-2019T01:34:56,AspiringNoodle,"On top of that, who the hell would pay for multiple parts that they're never gonna see?  Especially if it didn't fix the problem?"
14-06-2019T01:35:07,Dadrobit,"Not a good time noodle. Even if Apple are a bunch of money gobbling whores, there are a lot of decent folks with more money than sense that do good things on their devices."
14-06-2019T01:35:11,SageSaga,in their defense though- a brand new from the factory mac book pro shouldnt have its dimmer completely off
14-06-2019T01:35:14,Bgrmystr2,"if you're paying for the part to be put in your system cuz the previous one doesn't work, then according to apple's own payment, it belongs to you lolo"
14-06-2019T01:35:33,AspiringNoodle,"""Oh, yeah, so we had to swap out the motherboard multiple times, the battery, the cables, the display, and we eventually figured out the dimmer was set to 0."""
14-06-2019T01:35:51,AspiringNoodle,"""And we're charging you for all the parts we tried, no you can't keep the ones that didn't stay in the sytem."""
14-06-2019T01:36:29,SageSaga,however this did affect the customer- seeing as he was without his device for weeks when the issue was a button was pressed
14-06-2019T01:36:32,Dadrobit,And a lot of the folks I know who use Apple products in the professional world got theirs for cheap on the second hand market.
14-06-2019T01:36:47,SageSaga,his wasnt
14-06-2019T01:37:01,AspiringNoodle,"Long story short, NEVER BUY APPLE"
14-06-2019T01:37:12,Xalrog,all my computers were customer returns needing very minor repairs
14-06-2019T01:37:13,AspiringNoodle,"Their products are shit, their customer service is shit, and their operating system is shit."
14-06-2019T01:37:51,SageSaga,not true
14-06-2019T01:38:00,Dadrobit,"Yeah, not defending this particular instance, just saying a lot of good people make great stuff on apple machines that would be hurt from an apple apocalypse."
14-06-2019T01:38:04,SageSaga,their products are ok to pretty good and the OS is fine
14-06-2019T01:38:09,TheBeckoner,Yeah thats a bit extreme noodle
14-06-2019T01:38:28,AspiringNoodle,I'm in too deep man.
14-06-2019T01:38:34,TheBeckoner,I like the design just not the OS or hardware
14-06-2019T01:38:52,AspiringNoodle,"Oh, don't get me wrong, the aesthetics of their products are amazing"
14-06-2019T01:39:11,AspiringNoodle,But they almost always compromise function as a result.
14-06-2019T01:39:17,SageSaga,i might end up having to get an ipad pro
14-06-2019T01:39:32,SageSaga,they are apparently amazing as a digital portable drawing tablet
14-06-2019T01:39:40,SpazztasticKiwi,night Tom
14-06-2019T01:39:45,SpazztasticKiwi,& Sage
14-06-2019T01:39:46,AspiringNoodle,"....now that I think about it, I don't think I have any issues with their tablets"
14-06-2019T01:39:50,SageSaga,night Kiwi
14-06-2019T01:39:54,Dadrobit,The price is literally the only thing I find distasteful. That and some of the newer designs without adequate cooling.
14-06-2019T01:39:57,AspiringNoodle,"The issues are almost always with their AIO's, laptops, and phones."
14-06-2019T01:39:58,SpazztasticKiwi,& Ron if you’re still here
14-06-2019T01:40:02,SageSaga,its also not that expensive
14-06-2019T01:40:02,SpazztasticKiwi,& chat
14-06-2019T01:40:05,Mihari,G'night Kiwi
14-06-2019T01:40:15,SpazztasticKiwi,& Mihari
14-06-2019T01:40:19,Dadrobit,o/ spazz
14-06-2019T01:40:25,Mihari,"Their tablets, phones, and OS are great, their computer hardware, prices, and service is crap."
14-06-2019T01:40:32,SpazztasticKiwi,have good chat. I’m gonna try that sleep thing
14-06-2019T01:40:38,AspiringNoodle,"I'd argue the OS is becoming crap, too"
14-06-2019T01:40:42,SageSaga,oh and their policies
14-06-2019T01:40:48,AspiringNoodle,They're starting to develop it to limit hardware compatibility.
14-06-2019T01:40:49,Mihari,I can agree with that.
14-06-2019T01:41:05,AspiringNoodle,The latest versions of macOS no longer support Nvidia GPUs
14-06-2019T01:41:08,SageSaga,they have terrible practices when it comes to repair services
14-06-2019T01:41:18,AspiringNoodle,"And that was a deliberate decision, too."
14-06-2019T01:41:27,SageSaga,remember how they updated the iPhones to not work if you had the screen replaced?
14-06-2019T01:41:34,AspiringNoodle,^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
14-06-2019T01:41:37,AspiringNoodle,^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
14-06-2019T01:41:39,Xalrog,.......................
14-06-2019T01:42:00,AspiringNoodle,"If you're curious, they made it so that third-party screens wouldn't work."
14-06-2019T01:42:07,Xalrog,that's not an update
14-06-2019T01:43:01,SageSaga,oh but it is- they claimed inferior replacement parts were the cause and not their update
14-06-2019T01:43:03,Dadrobit,"It was a firmware thing yeah, the hardware was ID tagged and if the ID didn't match on the replacement, it wouldn't work."
14-06-2019T01:43:22,AspiringNoodle,"Apple wants to have complete control over your device, from creation to death."
14-06-2019T01:43:38,AspiringNoodle,"They want to control what apps you use, what hardware you use, and how you repair the device."
14-06-2019T01:43:54,Dadrobit,The home button was the part I heard them fo it with.
14-06-2019T01:43:57,AspiringNoodle,Apple is actually fighting in the courts right now the right to repair.
14-06-2019T01:44:13,RimaDraws,phew
14-06-2019T01:44:15,Bgrmystr2,yeah apple thinks that THEY own your device after you purchase it.
14-06-2019T01:44:21,Xalrog,"""my original screen broke because I replaced it with a 3rd party screen, not because I dropped it on a rock?"" Apple ""yes"""
14-06-2019T01:44:24,Bgrmystr2,"which is completely untrue, but they're really fighting it."
14-06-2019T01:44:26,RimaDraws,ouch i need to stretch
14-06-2019T01:44:38,AspiringNoodle,And folks like Louis Rossman (FUCK APPLE™) is trying to lead the charge.
14-06-2019T01:44:46,Xalrog,"remember to save, stretch, and drink some water"
14-06-2019T01:45:24,AspiringNoodle,"Apple fights dirty, too."
14-06-2019T01:45:35,Dadrobit,Hail hydrate
14-06-2019T01:45:37,AspiringNoodle,"Unless you're Apple-certified, you can't purchase first-party replacement parts"
14-06-2019T01:45:51,AspiringNoodle,"And if you're Apple-certified, you literally can't do board-level repairs anymore."
14-06-2019T01:46:15,AspiringNoodle,You'd be forced to do their crappy replace entire parts and charge an arm and a leg or risk losing your certification bs
14-06-2019T01:46:49,AspiringNoodle,"You can try using third-party parts, but who knows when Apple will issue an update to the OS and brick any third-party stuff."
14-06-2019T01:47:27,AspiringNoodle,"And even if you manage to buy refurbirshed first-party hardware, Apple will use Customs and Immigration Enforcement to take your stuff when you try shipping it into the country."
14-06-2019T01:47:33,Bgrmystr2,yeah that alone is reason enough to never buy apple products. Simply because they're so anti-consumer it's not even funny.
14-06-2019T01:47:58,unsteddyphoenix,That face is kinda...
14-06-2019T01:48:00,AspiringNoodle,Louis Rossman once tried to import refurbished Apple parts for his repair business.
14-06-2019T01:48:04,Bgrmystr2,"and they don't reimburse you for stuff that you paid for either, noodle lol"
14-06-2019T01:48:09,unsteddyphoenix,It's sorta...
14-06-2019T01:48:10,SageSaga,"in the future ""You have been randomly selected to have to get a new phone!"" ""Wow i won a new phone!"" ""You misread our message!"" *Phone starts smoking*"
14-06-2019T01:48:11,Bgrmystr2,"yeah phoenix, it's a thing."
14-06-2019T01:48:14,Bgrmystr2,shh
14-06-2019T01:48:16,Bgrmystr2,let it happen
14-06-2019T01:48:21,unsteddyphoenix,Ok im glad. Its not just me.
14-06-2019T01:48:23,unsteddyphoenix,Carry on.
14-06-2019T01:48:37,AspiringNoodle,"Apple used Customs and Immigration to seize all those batteries, claiming them to be counterfeit."
14-06-2019T01:48:46,Bgrmystr2,"Let the feeling well up inside you, like an explosion waiting to happen~"
14-06-2019T01:48:53,AspiringNoodle,At least I think it was batteries.  AT this point does it even matter?  Also nice O-face
14-06-2019T01:49:03,AspiringNoodle,Huehuehue :ptv-snicker:
14-06-2019T01:49:08,Bgrmystr2,Damnit noodle shuttup ya ruinedi t
14-06-2019T01:49:15,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-pouty:
14-06-2019T01:49:27,SageSaga,tongue not sticking out. Safe
14-06-2019T01:49:38,AspiringNoodle,^
14-06-2019T01:49:47,AspiringNoodle,I accept this explanation
14-06-2019T01:49:52,TheBeckoner,yet
14-06-2019T01:50:06,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-laugh:
14-06-2019T01:50:30,AspiringNoodle,"Anyways, you can literally try shipping in refurbished Apple hardware.  LEGITIMATE hardware.  And Apple will use the government to seize your rightfully purchased property."
14-06-2019T01:50:30,TheBeckoner,How do I do italic stuff?
14-06-2019T01:50:54,AspiringNoodle,"They will claim it's counterfeit, and will NOT reimburse you or hand it back."
14-06-2019T01:51:22,Bgrmystr2,and you can't prove it's not counterfeit because they have it and will refuse to give it back to you.
14-06-2019T01:51:26,AspiringNoodle,"Unless you cover / remove the Apple logos, anyways.  But with some hardware, doing so would render the part inoperable."
14-06-2019T01:51:30,Bgrmystr2,it's literally theft.
14-06-2019T01:51:42,TheBeckoner,*I got it*
14-06-2019T01:52:20,AspiringNoodle,"So it's not bad enough that they cut off third-party repair from first-party hardware, and can issue OS updates that brick third-party parts, but now they even use the government to bully repair shops by seizing legally purchased refurbished parts"
14-06-2019T01:52:35,Bgrmystr2,stuff they do not own or have any right to take
14-06-2019T01:52:36,AspiringNoodle,and claiming them to be counterfeit so the government can step in.
14-06-2019T01:52:46,Bgrmystr2,and they should have to PROVE it's counterfeit
14-06-2019T01:52:51,AspiringNoodle,^
14-06-2019T01:52:59,Bgrmystr2,"just cuz they claim it is doesn't mean it is, but they seem to have no contest.."
14-06-2019T01:53:14,AspiringNoodle,This is part of the problem with the government.
14-06-2019T01:53:29,AspiringNoodle,corporations hold WAY too much power over politicians and legal institutions.
14-06-2019T01:53:37,Dadrobit,"Pffft, you don't think they could easily ""prove"" something to be counterfeit?"
14-06-2019T01:53:48,AspiringNoodle,"Within the next 100 years, there might be some kind of major revolution."
14-06-2019T01:54:03,AspiringNoodle,Something to hopefully put businesses back in their place.
14-06-2019T01:54:32,SageSaga,so any must have games shown at E3 that i may have missed?
14-06-2019T01:54:40,AspiringNoodle,Cyberpunk 2077?
14-06-2019T01:54:56,AspiringNoodle,There's an Avengers game coming out that looks promising.
14-06-2019T01:55:05,Dadrobit,Fallout 76?
14-06-2019T01:55:07,SageSaga,Cyberpunk was already on my list before E3 XD
14-06-2019T01:55:11,TheBeckoner,keanu reeves?
14-06-2019T01:55:18,AspiringNoodle,Spiritfarer
14-06-2019T01:55:19,TheBeckoner,Thats funny Robit
14-06-2019T01:55:22,AspiringNoodle,DEER MOM!
14-06-2019T01:55:33,SageSaga,Fallout 76? What is that? Sounds disappointing
14-06-2019T01:55:46,AspiringNoodle,"I would say get Anthem, but that's worse, lmao"
14-06-2019T01:56:07,Dadrobit,"It's kinda like Elder Scrolls Blades on the Switch, but with more guns and glitches."
14-06-2019T01:56:57,AspiringNoodle,Elden Ring?
14-06-2019T01:57:18,SageSaga,they didnt really show anything of Elden Ring to get me excited
14-06-2019T01:57:31,AspiringNoodle,"Are you fan of the Soulsborne series, though?"
14-06-2019T01:57:53,SageSaga,yeah
14-06-2019T01:58:01,TheBeckoner,Welp streams have been good but I'm goin to bed. Night
14-06-2019T01:58:02,AspiringNoodle,Then nothing to worry about~
14-06-2019T01:58:06,SageSaga,but still- that trailer meant nothing
14-06-2019T01:58:47,Dadrobit,"Avengers looks like nothing tbh. It was just a prerendered cut scene of what they HOPE the game will play like. What they showed means nothing in regards to what the actual game would be like. Also, knock off Avengers are knock off."
14-06-2019T01:58:55,SageSaga,"the only thing that trailer did was make me laugh at my friend for thinking ""Hey! Studio Gibli and George RR Martin are teaming up!"""
14-06-2019T01:59:04,Dadrobit,Anthem vibes through the roof
14-06-2019T01:59:16,AspiringNoodle,"Watch YongYea, he covers news from the industry"
14-06-2019T01:59:40,SageSaga,did no one get why that was funny?
14-06-2019T01:59:55,AspiringNoodle,"I believe he did see actual gameplay, and said it looked promising."
14-06-2019T02:00:02,Dadrobit,I'd watch that. Grave of the Fireflies 2
14-06-2019T02:00:08,AspiringNoodle,^
14-06-2019T02:00:44,SageSaga,"=_= the lead for Darksouls is also named Miyazaki but hes not ""That"" Miyazaki"
14-06-2019T02:00:56,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I got it."
14-06-2019T02:00:59,AspiringNoodle,"Oh yeah, lmao"
14-06-2019T02:01:14,ZRO4825,I have trouble keeping track of names I don't see/hear on a regular basis. :x
14-06-2019T02:01:30,Dadrobit,Wake me up when Bloodborne 2 is announced.
14-06-2019T02:01:32,AspiringNoodle,Studio Ghibli = Hayao Miyazaki
14-06-2019T02:01:40,sunblaze,hi everyone
14-06-2019T02:01:40,AspiringNoodle,From Software = Hidetaka Miyazaki
14-06-2019T02:01:42,DarthRexKing,Goodbye.
14-06-2019T02:01:54,SageSaga,yo Sunblaze!
14-06-2019T02:01:55,Dadrobit,Hi/bye
14-06-2019T02:02:55,AspiringNoodle,"Man, Epic's been on a roll pissing off the gaming community"
14-06-2019T02:03:07,ZRO4825,What'd they do *now*? lol
14-06-2019T02:03:08,PurpleLemons,:cpurplelemons-kumi-dance: this music man
14-06-2019T02:03:11,DarthRexKing,:3
14-06-2019T02:03:14,DarthRexKing,lol. :V
14-06-2019T02:03:14,AspiringNoodle,I wonder if we'll start seeing bait-and-switch class-action lawsuits against developers soon
14-06-2019T02:03:24,AspiringNoodle,There's been another casualty. Shenmue 3
14-06-2019T02:03:39,AspiringNoodle,Almost 70k backers got screwed by the developer who decided to pull the ol bait-and-switch
14-06-2019T02:04:10,AspiringNoodle,"""Oh yeah, this'll be on Steam. *PSYCHE* EPIC EXCLUSIVE BITCHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES. NO REFUNDS *flips off backers and moonwalks away*"""
14-06-2019T02:04:36,sunblaze,yep and they said steam during the kickstarter. now epic pays more money and bam angry backers
14-06-2019T02:04:51,AspiringNoodle,It's only a matter of time before class-action lawsuits are levied
14-06-2019T02:05:02,sunblaze,imho thats not only epics fault.
14-06-2019T02:05:16,sunblaze,the devs that agreed on that and took their money are as well
14-06-2019T02:05:16,AspiringNoodle,"Companies keep using backers to fund development, promise games on other platforms, then swap to epic only at launch"
14-06-2019T02:05:39,AspiringNoodle,Epic's scummy for facilitating this whole situation in the first place.  The devs are even scummier for backstabing their fans.
14-06-2019T02:06:18,AspiringNoodle,"And legitimately, if you developer, market, and crowdfund a game under promises of a steam launch and then swap to epic exclusive, that SHOULD be considered bait-and-switch fraud."
14-06-2019T02:06:24,RimaDraws,i think thats it on drawing for me tonight
14-06-2019T02:06:32,Dadrobit,There's not a judge in the world that'd convict.
14-06-2019T02:07:22,AspiringNoodle,"Tbh, Shenmue 3 may open the door."
14-06-2019T02:07:28,Dadrobit,Brb
14-06-2019T02:07:45,RimaDraws,ugh been up nearly 24 hours
14-06-2019T02:07:53,AspiringNoodle,"They took people's money under promise of a Steam launch, then switched to Epic only (temporarily) after the game was made and getting ready for launch"
14-06-2019T02:08:37,SageSaga,here is their out though- the people can still get it on steam- just after the exclusivity deal is over
14-06-2019T02:08:38,AspiringNoodle,"In particular, because they're refusing refunds to the backers (who effectively purchased the product under certain promises), they *could* be found guilty of bait-and-switch fraudulent advertising."
14-06-2019T02:09:18,AspiringNoodle,And I believe this to be the case because they paid in under the promise of things like Steam codes.
14-06-2019T02:09:36,AspiringNoodle,"Well, if they only get Epic codes when the product finally launches, that is legit bait-and-switch."
14-06-2019T02:10:31,AspiringNoodle,"And thanks to things like lootboxes, the law is finally starting to examine some technological changes."
14-06-2019T02:10:47,AspiringNoodle,"So if this kind of behavior isn't explicitly illegal now, it could be."
14-06-2019T02:13:31,AspiringNoodle,*scrolls up*
14-06-2019T02:13:51,AspiringNoodle,I talk too much :ptv-confused:
14-06-2019T02:13:57,ZRO4825,"Problem with that is, half the people making decisions on laws regarding technological advances don't understand 3/4 of the technological advances they're making decisions on."
14-06-2019T02:14:26,AspiringNoodle,Aaaaaaaaaaand they prefer listening to money.
14-06-2019T02:14:38,AspiringNoodle,:dollar::dollar::dollar:

14-06-2019T02:21:22,AspiringNoodle,Night everyone
14-06-2019T02:21:43,SageSaga,color stream last week was over in like 2 hour s XD
14-06-2019T02:21:50,Bgrmystr2,yeah it was super quick
14-06-2019T02:22:04,AspiringNoodle,Quality > length
14-06-2019T02:22:07,AspiringNoodle,It was peak quality
14-06-2019T02:22:15,AspiringNoodle,PEAK. QUALITY.
14-06-2019T02:32:29,Dadrobit,"Goddamn it, idiot kids playing on the golf course at midnight."
14-06-2019T02:32:49,Dadrobit,Had to be the bad guy tonight.
14-06-2019T02:33:40,Dadrobit,"Had to call momma to come pick up her daughter and her friends and lemme tell ya, momma was PISSED."
14-06-2019T02:34:30,Dadrobit,Kids tried bolting on me before I convinced them to give me their names and parents information.
14-06-2019T02:36:01,Dadrobit,Gave up when they got to their cars and saw I blocked them with the truck. Showed them I already took all their vehicle info and threatened to get police out here for trespassing. That got them compliant real fucking quick.
14-06-2019T02:36:41,Dadrobit,"Lots of crying, but PD didn't get called in the end. Because fuck that paperwork."
14-06-2019T02:36:52,AspiringNoodle,Omega OOF
14-06-2019T02:37:52,AspiringNoodle,"So, let's see"
14-06-2019T02:38:32,AspiringNoodle,"You said you do security, right?"
14-06-2019T02:39:04,Dadrobit,"Among other things, that's currently my main source of income"
14-06-2019T02:39:39,AspiringNoodle,"So if I remember correctly: 2 employees fired, since they couldn't cut it, a temporary power outage, and now kids doing stupid things?"
14-06-2019T02:39:54,Dadrobit,"Apologies if I don't get reply quick for the next few minutes, still writing a report on all this."
14-06-2019T02:40:01,AspiringNoodle,Sounds like a fun week.
14-06-2019T02:41:16,Dadrobit,Only one fire this week.
14-06-2019T02:41:28,Dadrobit,The other was 2 weeks ago.
14-06-2019T02:41:58,AspiringNoodle,"Man, my sense of time is distorted."
14-06-2019T02:42:08,AspiringNoodle,"Guess what they say is true, time goes faster as you get older xD"
14-06-2019T02:42:59,Dadrobit,And the kids are kind of a serious offense. This place is real deal desert and we have a lot of legitimately dangerous animals up to and including mountain lions. Cell phone flashlights aren't going to do jack shit.
14-06-2019T02:43:24,Dadrobit,To say nothing of the actual trespassing.
14-06-2019T02:43:45,AspiringNoodle,"Um, Eaten alive by mountain lions > trespassing xD"
14-06-2019T02:44:01,AspiringNoodle,Definitely the bigger concern
14-06-2019T03:09:46,Dadrobit,Now they're dealing with the worst of the lot. A royally pissed momma who just had to be called at midnight to come escort her daughter home after being told she was trespassing and tried running from security.
14-06-2019T03:10:15,Dadrobit,"And with that nonsense finished, it's time for some dinner methinks."
14-06-2019T03:20:46,AspiringNoodle,You earned it <3
14-06-2019T03:21:55,Dadrobit,"$.88 frozen dinner with a Redbull, dinner of champions."
14-06-2019T03:22:24,Bgrmystr2,can I ask how old they were? how many were there? I'm just curious
14-06-2019T03:22:50,Bgrmystr2,got a friend over and we were just talkin bout it
14-06-2019T03:23:25,Dadrobit,5 kids in two cars aged 15-17. The leader was a girl who lived in the community that was having a sleepover and was supposed to be back before curfew.
14-06-2019T03:23:59,Bgrmystr2,well then
14-06-2019T03:24:50,Dadrobit,"I was semi-familiar with the mother, but the kids were not from here at all."
14-06-2019T03:25:03,Dadrobit,The other kids I should say.
14-06-2019T03:25:28,Dadrobit,Friends from school she was showing off to.
14-06-2019T03:25:33,Bgrmystr2,"I can understand most places not having a curfew, specially for an older teen group, but in the middle of a desert with wild animals roaming"
14-06-2019T03:25:40,Bgrmystr2,that's somethin different
14-06-2019T03:26:12,Dadrobit,"Yeah, especially since this place has no streetlights whatsoever. It's pitch black out here."
14-06-2019T03:26:45,Dadrobit,Even home lights are low light emission
14-06-2019T03:27:02,Bgrmystr2,"It's dangerous round here in Orleans too, granted we don't have wild animals like you guys do probably, but there's some dangerous ass characters in some areas"
14-06-2019T03:27:17,Bgrmystr2,So it's kind of sort of relatable.
14-06-2019T03:30:20,Dadrobit,"Yeah, aside from the odd drunk kid drunk driving their supercar at two in the morning, the people here are rarely dangerous. But we do have bobcats and rattlesnakes out the ass."
14-06-2019T03:30:45,Dadrobit,"And a mountain lion or two, but I very rarely see them roaming."
14-06-2019T03:32:23,Dadrobit,29% battery and 4 hours left. RIP.
14-06-2019T03:35:37,Dadrobit,Minor envy going on atm. Another guard brought in a portable stove and a wok and he's making stir fry in his gate house.
14-06-2019T03:35:52,AspiringNoodle,LMAO
14-06-2019T03:36:11,AspiringNoodle,That makes me think of those photos of people who bring a whole gaming setup to mcdonalds
14-06-2019T03:36:21,AspiringNoodle,"Console, monitor, controller, everything xD"
14-06-2019T03:37:15,Dadrobit,"This guy has worked here forever. Every Friday he makes this meal. ""It's stir Friday baby!"""

14-06-2019T04:42:21,Dadrobit,Looks like the most bottom of the barrel stuff still though...
14-06-2019T04:44:53,Dadrobit,Finally arriving*
14-06-2019T04:56:13,AspiringNoodle,"Tbf, Bethesda's reputation is already rock bottom after Fallout 76, the multiple scandals thereafter, and Todd Howard's comments in interviews."
14-06-2019T04:56:46,AspiringNoodle,"It's possible for them to go even lower than they already are, but they still have a chance to climb back up.  It's just that everything they do for the next few years will be under extreme scrutiny."

14-06-2019T05:00:23,Dadrobit,'Least Zenimax Studios is doing right by the Scrolls IP. ESO is honestly really solid.

14-06-2019T06:09:55,Bgrmystr2,lol rip
14-06-2019T06:10:10,Bgrmystr2,was prolly nice to chat up a bit though
14-06-2019T06:11:03,Dadrobit,"Yeah, he seemed like a nice enough kid. Was his second week on the job."
14-06-2019T06:13:31,Dadrobit,"It was unnerving at first though since he came in with his phone camera on and recording which is what we do when we're doing a ""welfare check"". Aka, trying to catch someone sleeping or misbehaving on some way."
14-06-2019T06:13:48,Dadrobit,In some*
14-06-2019T06:14:30,Dadrobit,"I was like, ""shit, do they mistrust me for something????"""
14-06-2019T06:19:45,Dadrobit,"Also do it for uniform checkups as well. Ironed shirt, clean shaven, shined shoes, no lint or loose clothes strands anywhere and the like."
14-06-2019T10:23:27,SpazztasticKiwi,here they don’t seem to care if you have fuzz face

14-06-2019T14:06:16,SageSaga,"sweet, did it arrive in good condition?"
14-06-2019T14:06:52,RimaDraws,yes it did! perfect ^^
14-06-2019T14:07:09,ZRO4825,"Yes, yes Kaylin is."
14-06-2019T14:07:30,SageSaga,good- ive had a few that were bent pretty badly and a few dented corners T_T
14-06-2019T14:07:30,ZRO4825,"Okay, that's a lie, Toyoko is, not Kaylin, but she's not in that comic, so it goes to Relm instead. =D"
14-06-2019T14:07:52,RimaDraws,i love it tho. thank you so much

14-06-2019T14:16:07,SageSaga,"the only one that might hug a rando is Lilith, and its probably to break their back"

14-06-2019T14:18:38,ZRO4825,That's cuz she's psycho. lol
14-06-2019T14:19:37,SageSaga,exactly- normal people dont just hug strangers
14-06-2019T14:20:34,AspiringNoodle,I imagine a character who hugs randoms and they DON'T freak out would be a total Mary Sue xD
14-06-2019T14:21:18,AspiringNoodle,"At the very least, they would need to be confused / uncomfortable."
14-06-2019T14:22:22,ZRO4825,There are people like that out there who aren't afraid to just hand out hugs. :P
14-06-2019T14:23:20,AspiringNoodle,I think there's a term for people like them ^^

14-06-2019T14:26:19,AspiringNoodle,Does Saitama hug it to death? :P
14-06-2019T14:27:16,SageSaga,no Puri Puri Prisoner does
14-06-2019T14:27:26,AspiringNoodle,...I think that's more terrifying than the monster

14-06-2019T14:30:15,AspiringNoodle,I know ;_;
14-06-2019T14:30:44,AspiringNoodle,"That said, I do actually like the character."
14-06-2019T14:31:24,AspiringNoodle,I particularly like that his fight against the Sea King led to some character development.

14-06-2019T14:39:35,TeapotOfDoom,Damn you got my hopes up
14-06-2019T14:40:11,SageSaga,oh jeez i saw something infuriating last night
14-06-2019T14:40:29,ZRO4825,o.o;
14-06-2019T14:40:32,AspiringNoodle,deeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeets
14-06-2019T14:40:56,SageSaga,"someone wrote an article ""10 People who could beat Saitama"""
14-06-2019T14:41:06,AspiringNoodle,...*NERD RAGE ENGAGED*
14-06-2019T14:41:14,TeapotOfDoom,This truly is infuriating
14-06-2019T14:41:25,TeapotOfDoom,Noone can beat him
14-06-2019T14:41:35,ZRO4825,Sounds like clickbait.
14-06-2019T14:41:41,SageSaga,like- i'll give em like one or two might stand some chance given circumstances
14-06-2019T14:42:02,SageSaga,but some of them were like legit things he deals with in the manga...
14-06-2019T14:42:30,AspiringNoodle,I imagine the only way to beat Saitama would be mentally.  He can't lose in a physical battle.
14-06-2019T14:42:36,SageSaga,like one i agree with is Haruhi - he cant beat her
14-06-2019T14:42:43,Mihari,Anyone that can throw him into space and in direction where he won't have a physical body to ping off of before he runs out of air.
14-06-2019T14:43:34,ZRO4825,Valid point~
14-06-2019T14:44:10,SageSaga,actually its possible that wouldnt stop him - but fighting in zero G where he cant move is probably one of the best answers
14-06-2019T14:44:39,Mihari,"Who said abou fighting him, just throw him and let him go! XD"
14-06-2019T14:45:01,AspiringNoodle,I think we can consider Saitama to be invulnerable to physical damage.
14-06-2019T14:45:31,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-sleepy: mmmmarblegarble
14-06-2019T14:45:32,AspiringNoodle,"So the only ways to beat him would be to attack his mind, his ability to breath, and his ability to eat."
14-06-2019T14:45:48,TeapotOfDoom,I think there is another way
14-06-2019T14:45:53,SageSaga,i think one of the biggest offenders was Saiki
14-06-2019T14:46:20,Bgrmystr2,you guys are always up so early on saturday
14-06-2019T14:46:25,Bgrmystr2,mornin
14-06-2019T14:46:31,Mihari,Early? O_o
14-06-2019T14:46:32,SageSaga,"it was like ""Saiki could take him!"" Saiki is super powerful Telekinetic"
14-06-2019T14:46:52,SageSaga,we have a super powerful TK and she cant do anything to Saitama
14-06-2019T14:47:09,TeapotOfDoom,"Even if you can't beat him, you can keep him from winning. Considering the probability of hitting an object in space even if he's able to hold his breath indefinitely he won't come back"
14-06-2019T14:47:16,Bgrmystr2,Early.
14-06-2019T14:47:54,Bgrmystr2,"and yeah that's the thing abotu space, most areas in space do not have stuff for someone to touch."
14-06-2019T14:48:02,Bgrmystr2,it's majority empty
14-06-2019T14:48:20,AspiringNoodle,"I looked up Saiki, and he does have some powers that could defeat Saitama"
14-06-2019T14:48:22,Mihari,I guess you missed that.
14-06-2019T14:48:29,TeapotOfDoom,Didn't Saitama already beat someone with telikenisis?
14-06-2019T14:48:29,Mihari,We already said that's how you could do it XD
14-06-2019T14:48:41,SageSaga,Psychic powers dont work on Saitama
14-06-2019T14:49:04,TeapotOfDoom,Oh yeah sry then yeah same point xD
14-06-2019T14:49:13,SageSaga,Tornado tried with all her might just to hold him back and he barely noticed
14-06-2019T14:49:15,AspiringNoodle,"I haven't watched season 2 or watched the anime, but don't the psychics in OPM only have telekinetic powers?"
14-06-2019T14:49:53,AspiringNoodle,read the manga*
14-06-2019T14:49:57,AspiringNoodle,"Brain, y u so derp?"
14-06-2019T14:50:36,Mihari,"Has he ever been attacked psychically IE directly effecting the mind, not using your minds powers to effect the outside world?"
14-06-2019T14:50:45,AspiringNoodle,^
14-06-2019T14:50:45,TeapotOfDoom,"Even if you attacked his mind, wasn't his training focused on hardening his mind as well?"
14-06-2019T14:51:03,TeapotOfDoom,Dunno tbh I don't think so
14-06-2019T14:51:04,AspiringNoodle,"I think that was more of a ""I don't have money"" kind of thing :P"
14-06-2019T14:51:36,Mihari,saitama is kinda of a joke character so trying to invent ways to beat him they probably already have an excuse for
14-06-2019T14:52:02,SageSaga,yeah
14-06-2019T14:52:11,Mihari,But what we do know
14-06-2019T14:52:16,Mihari,Is that he couldn't breathe in space
14-06-2019T14:52:20,Mihari,But he did survive in the vacuum of space
14-06-2019T14:52:22,AspiringNoodle,"That, or psychics in OPM don't have the ability to attack the mind, problem solved :)"
14-06-2019T14:52:39,SageSaga,being able to survive in a vacuum is pretty nuts
14-06-2019T14:52:42,Mihari,Yah
14-06-2019T14:53:00,Mihari,But the fact he couldn't breathe means if you fling him into space and he doesn't come into contact with ANYTHING that's virtually a win
14-06-2019T14:53:05,RimaDraws,pfft
14-06-2019T14:53:14,Mihari,However
14-06-2019T14:53:21,AspiringNoodle,"Considering most people would only last about 30 seconds in the vacuum of space, we can indeed say that he is physically indestructible."
14-06-2019T14:53:24,Mihari,It's likely he can just punch so hard he can create his own interia
14-06-2019T14:53:49,Mihari,So even that
14-06-2019T14:53:58,AspiringNoodle,He could always just take off a boot and throw it so hard that he reverses course :P
14-06-2019T14:54:15,AspiringNoodle,"Then again, he isn't the brightest ^^;"
14-06-2019T14:54:17,SageSaga,even though that doesnt make sense- he is shown to be able to put more force into a punch than his body would be able to hold- so yeah he can generate more thrust than required to move his body
14-06-2019T14:54:23,TeapotOfDoom,Well considering that the laws of physics don't really apply to the OPM universe I wouldn't be surprised
14-06-2019T14:54:50,SageSaga,they also put Naruto and Goku on the list
14-06-2019T14:55:09,TeapotOfDoom,Well there is a great video of an astronaut on the ISS trapped in the middle of a habitation module
14-06-2019T14:55:12,Mihari,Naruto can't beat him
14-06-2019T14:55:20,Mihari,Goku might be able to instant transmission him somewhere
14-06-2019T14:55:22,Mihari,But yah
14-06-2019T14:55:28,SageSaga,except Goku never would
14-06-2019T14:55:33,Mihari,Excactly
14-06-2019T14:55:37,SageSaga,Goku would want to fight- take one hit and die
14-06-2019T14:55:44,SageSaga,again
14-06-2019T14:56:16,Mihari,If we are talking about Hokage Naruto he might try to talk his way out of it unlike all the rest. XD
14-06-2019T14:56:28,TeapotOfDoom,"I wonder, wouldn't that mean that much like Borus he would be one of the few that took more then just one punch?"
14-06-2019T14:56:34,AspiringNoodle,In terms of a physical brawl... Superman or Doomsday could stand a change.
14-06-2019T14:56:36,SageSaga,a weird one they mentioned was one i barely remember
14-06-2019T14:56:39,SageSaga,Kami Tenchi
14-06-2019T14:56:48,Bgrmystr2,"the only way to ""win is not to play."
14-06-2019T14:57:20,Mihari,Superman would lose too
14-06-2019T14:57:24,Mihari,depending on which superman
14-06-2019T14:57:28,TeapotOfDoom,Am I wrong or was that an Iroh quote
14-06-2019T14:57:41,AspiringNoodle,I think any superman could potentially win xD
14-06-2019T14:57:41,Mihari,Doomsday would lose just because he's been beaten by Superman
14-06-2019T14:57:58,FoxxTrotter,"WarGames, teapot."
14-06-2019T14:57:59,SageSaga,Darkseid would be interesting
14-06-2019T14:58:04,Mihari,Superman still takes damage and his resistance is only up to a certain point
14-06-2019T14:58:05,AspiringNoodle,"Doomsday is stupidly OP, though"
14-06-2019T14:58:13,AspiringNoodle,His power is literally adapation to the extreme
14-06-2019T14:58:22,AspiringNoodle,Adaptation*
14-06-2019T14:58:22,Mihari,The fact that super powered beings have hit him so hard to inflict pain is proof that he's not invulnerable to everything
14-06-2019T14:58:26,Mihari,Saitama just is XD
14-06-2019T14:58:57,Mihari,Darkseid I would love to see
14-06-2019T14:59:04,SageSaga,Saitama's resistances are so high he's surprised when people hit him because he can barely feel it
14-06-2019T14:59:04,AspiringNoodle,"Not joking Doomsday is so OP that the only way he was officially defeated in the comics was to bring him to the end of time and leave him there.  Because his adaptation powers are so OP, that he became immune to death"
14-06-2019T14:59:04,Mihari,That would be a great fight
14-06-2019T14:59:29,Mihari,The key to adaption tho
14-06-2019T14:59:34,Mihari,Is to survive the first one
14-06-2019T14:59:37,AspiringNoodle,"yeah, you can *kill* Doomsday, but after X amount of time, he would revive and become immune to the method used to kill him."
14-06-2019T14:59:42,Mihari,And that's the rub with saitama
14-06-2019T14:59:57,AspiringNoodle,"The problem is, Doomsday's already been killed via brute force / blunt trauma"
14-06-2019T15:00:02,SageSaga,i do like the idea of Haruhi vs Saitama
14-06-2019T15:00:21,Mihari,Reality powers?
14-06-2019T15:00:30,Mihari,Scarlet Witch might do a decent job?
14-06-2019T15:00:34,SageSaga,so long as Haruhi believes he cant beat her he cant- and if Haruhi just doesnt believe in super powers- Saitama loses his powers
14-06-2019T15:00:58,TeapotOfDoom,Saitama vs Thanos with all Infinity stones. Would the stones be destroyed in an attempt to destroy Saitama?
14-06-2019T15:00:59,SageSaga,Scarlet has too much prep time - she needs to gather her powers and use them
14-06-2019T15:01:21,PurpleLemons,:cpurplelemons-ooo: match of the century?
14-06-2019T15:01:22,Mihari,They would just argue the stones don't work in Saitama's reality... instant loss
14-06-2019T15:01:23,SageSaga,Haruhi just subconciously manipulates reality
14-06-2019T15:01:37,FoxxTrotter,"Hi, Lemons."
14-06-2019T15:01:41,Mihari,Cause the stones can only work in the reality they are from
14-06-2019T15:01:48,AspiringNoodle,^
14-06-2019T15:01:55,PurpleLemons,damn that's good logic actually
14-06-2019T15:02:10,AspiringNoodle,"So Saitama would either need to be teleported to the MCU, or Thanos would need to find the stones in Saitama's universe, assuming they exist."
14-06-2019T15:02:20,Mihari,"Haruhi is probably he best bet, as stupid as that is"
14-06-2019T15:02:29,TeapotOfDoom,Jep. Reality seamingly can't be whatever Thanos wants
14-06-2019T15:02:34,PurpleLemons,hi Foxx o/
14-06-2019T15:02:40,SageSaga,Mihari- what do you remember about Kami Tenchi?
14-06-2019T15:02:46,AspiringNoodle,"To be fair, the only way to guarantee a win against Saitama is just to not play the physical combat game :ptv-laugh:"
14-06-2019T15:03:14,TeapotOfDoom,"Once you're in physical combat, you've lost"
14-06-2019T15:06:14,RedDragonSyndicate,hey man
14-06-2019T15:06:39,SageSaga,yo Red
14-06-2019T15:06:41,Mihari,I did not like that whole arc with the story Sage XD
14-06-2019T15:07:07,Mihari,"Tsunami and Washu are all power godesses, geez."
14-06-2019T15:07:15,Mihari,That was stupid
14-06-2019T15:09:40,AspiringNoodle,"Go figure, I wondered for so long how artists made these really detailed trees / bushes / foliage.  And it's just a brush!!! xD"
14-06-2019T15:09:54,AspiringNoodle,#TechnologyForTheWin
14-06-2019T15:10:10,TeapotOfDoom,Just a tap
14-06-2019T15:10:39,AspiringNoodle,"Mmmm, that tree is THICC"
14-06-2019T15:11:13,TeapotOfDoom,It's a happy little tree
14-06-2019T15:11:17,SageSaga,i might not even use these for this and go with something more paintery
14-06-2019T15:13:08,AspiringNoodle,"Whatever you decide, I respect and support your decision :ptv-hearts:"
14-06-2019T15:16:13,TeapotOfDoom,rip my connection
14-06-2019T15:21:43,AspiringNoodle,So pretty~
14-06-2019T15:22:42,RimaDraws,looking good sage
14-06-2019T15:22:51,SageSaga,ty
14-06-2019T15:26:42,RimaDraws,np
14-06-2019T15:39:50,SageSaga,man - I missed doing Forest backgrounds but i still need more practice with them XD
14-06-2019T15:40:26,MatyMaty,Sage you just need to learn the newest technique
14-06-2019T15:40:45,SageSaga,drawing them before hand and just reusing them?
14-06-2019T15:40:49,MatyMaty,"Just google ""visual novel forest background"" and add a lot of blur :P"
14-06-2019T15:43:03,SageSaga,hue hue hue
14-06-2019T15:43:23,SageSaga,yeah no...
14-06-2019T15:45:23,MatyMaty,:cmatymaty-GOO:
14-06-2019T15:45:27,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-ohmy:
14-06-2019T15:47:05,RimaDraws,lol
14-06-2019T15:47:11,FoxxTrotter,"Hi, Red and Maty."
14-06-2019T15:48:44,MatyMaty,'alloo
14-06-2019T16:01:47,SageSaga,wow- actually a lot of people are watching today
14-06-2019T16:02:32,SageSaga,howdy folks o_o
14-06-2019T16:04:20,SpazztasticKiwi,ahhhhhhhhh
14-06-2019T16:04:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Sup peeps
14-06-2019T16:06:41,MatyMaty,Hello everyone!
14-06-2019T16:07:56,RazorToshiba,Aloha Sage~
14-06-2019T16:08:16,MatyMaty,Lots of folks and without having to do Zro's Toyoko requests :P
14-06-2019T16:08:23,SageSaga,yo Razor
14-06-2019T16:13:05,RedDragonSyndicate,"wow 50 viewers, nice man"
14-06-2019T16:13:05,RazorToshiba,How goes it Sage?
14-06-2019T16:13:37,SageSaga,im doing alright- a bit tired. I havent slept well in a while
14-06-2019T16:13:55,RazorToshiba,I'm tired but for different reasons lol
14-06-2019T16:16:09,MatyMaty,why? :(
14-06-2019T16:16:46,ZRO4825,"That's cuz I requested Lien this month, Maty. 😝"
14-06-2019T16:16:50,SageSaga,ive been having frequent nightmares
14-06-2019T16:17:07,MatyMaty,Lien nightmares?
14-06-2019T16:17:17,RazorToshiba,Yeesh that's no fun
14-06-2019T16:17:17,SageSaga,nah Liens cool in my dreams
14-06-2019T16:17:26,ZRO4825,lol
14-06-2019T16:17:43,SageSaga,i have frequent very vivid dreams
14-06-2019T16:17:50,SageSaga,Nightmares too though
14-06-2019T16:18:04,ZRO4825,:c
14-06-2019T16:18:12,RazorToshiba,I rarely dream tbh
14-06-2019T16:18:18,SageSaga,i was visited by the witches again a few weeks ago- and a few days ago had a demon set me on fire
14-06-2019T16:18:29,MatyMaty,O.O
14-06-2019T16:19:09,ZRO4825,"Dude, wth o.o;"
14-06-2019T16:19:10,RimaDraws,phew one art done
14-06-2019T16:19:36,SageSaga,the witches one is probably the worse
14-06-2019T16:20:03,SpazztasticKiwi,halloween in june
14-06-2019T16:20:19,SpazztasticKiwi,tell your brain wrong season
14-06-2019T16:20:33,SageSaga,"cuz its almost always one of those ""Oh good i woke up"" *Falls back asleep finally"" Witches- ""Ah welcome back - where did we leave off?"""
14-06-2019T16:20:39,SpazztasticKiwi,supposed to be having fathers day nightmares
14-06-2019T16:21:30,RimaDraws,witches?
14-06-2019T16:21:38,RazorToshiba,That's... interesting
14-06-2019T16:22:37,SpazztasticKiwi,think it’s con nerve?
14-06-2019T16:22:45,SageSaga,"the witches nightmare i have - its like i wake up- and theres a witch or two standing over me- once im ""awake"" they start to either gnaw off my toes or cut them off- and then they start slicing up my legs and eating me"
14-06-2019T16:23:19,SpazztasticKiwi,well you do come pre seasoned
14-06-2019T16:23:26,RazorToshiba,g e e z e
14-06-2019T16:23:38,SageSaga,i usually wake up when one grabs me by the ankle and twists it so she can get a better angle to cut with her saw
14-06-2019T16:24:06,SageSaga,"and then when i fall back to sleep they are like ""Ah! hes back!"" and it starts off where they left off"
14-06-2019T16:24:40,SpazztasticKiwi,usually what helps with a return dream is walking around before resleep mode
14-06-2019T16:24:48,SpazztasticKiwi,resets the unconscious
14-06-2019T16:25:02,SpazztasticKiwi,can wake you up too but you gotta pick one
14-06-2019T16:26:12,MatyMaty,too scary :(
14-06-2019T16:29:15,AspiringNoodle,"Yeesh... I've had similar, vivid nightmares."
14-06-2019T16:29:22,AspiringNoodle,Ain't they just a hoot? >_>
14-06-2019T16:30:07,RimaDraws,i dont like having nightmares
14-06-2019T16:30:20,SageSaga,me either
14-06-2019T16:31:07,AspiringNoodle,What's worse is when your nightmares are semi-lucid.  Are at least seem like it
14-06-2019T16:31:11,AspiringNoodle,Or*
14-06-2019T16:31:59,RimaDraws,ive had lucid nightmares before
14-06-2019T16:32:01,RimaDraws,those are no fun
14-06-2019T16:32:15,RimaDraws,mix that with sleep paralysis then its a party
14-06-2019T16:32:18,TeapotOfDoom,I can only imagine
14-06-2019T16:32:41,AspiringNoodle,"Feeling like having a semblance of control, ""Okay, to NOT die, I should do this"", and then the nightmare does EVERYTHING in its power to laugh at your efforts?"
14-06-2019T16:33:09,TeapotOfDoom,I hate the fact that you can't run fast in a dream if you want to
14-06-2019T16:33:46,AspiringNoodle,Mine are more of a checklist of absurdity
14-06-2019T16:35:12,AspiringNoodle,The last lucid nightmare I remember was a World War Z type scenario.
14-06-2019T16:35:27,AspiringNoodle,"Oh boy, was my heart pumping when I snapped awake!"
14-06-2019T16:39:40,AspiringNoodle,"Rima, I'm curious, what's the central source of terror in your lucid nightmares?"
14-06-2019T16:39:56,AspiringNoodle,Mine is a loss of control ^^;
14-06-2019T16:40:03,AspiringNoodle,Murphy's law on steroids.
14-06-2019T16:41:33,SpazztasticKiwi,I might have a problem with my dreams in that if something odd or traditionally scary happens I’m like “ok well I guess that’s normal now”
14-06-2019T16:41:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Not sure if peak nihilism or Buddhism
14-06-2019T16:42:19,AspiringNoodle,"For me, it's the appropriate survival response, but every that can go wrong will go wrong."
14-06-2019T16:42:40,AspiringNoodle,"That, or stuff starts compounding to ridiculous degrees xD"
14-06-2019T16:42:54,RimaDraws,oh i rarely have them anymore
14-06-2019T16:52:56,SageSaga,brb
14-06-2019T16:55:54,RimaDraws,okies sage
14-06-2019T16:57:31,RazorToshiba,Honestly one of my favorite RWBY songs
14-06-2019T16:57:56,SageSaga,back
14-06-2019T16:58:01,RazorToshiba,weba!
14-06-2019T16:58:39,SageSaga,ty
14-06-2019T16:58:49,RimaDraws,i am listening to my music which one is it?
14-06-2019T16:59:23,RimaDraws,i am listening to the 5th volume theme to rwby now
14-06-2019T16:59:23,SageSaga,man i gotta wake up early tomorrow to cook steaks for a bunch of people
14-06-2019T16:59:57,SageSaga,"i think the one playing when Razor said that was ""Home"""
14-06-2019T17:00:44,MatyMaty,gonna be a BBQ chef?
14-06-2019T17:01:18,RimaDraws,ooh oki
14-06-2019T17:01:50,SageSaga,is what i do
14-06-2019T17:02:07,SageSaga,somehow i became grill master of the family
14-06-2019T17:03:03,SageSaga,oh i made my first new computer purchase
14-06-2019T17:03:12,MatyMaty,it has RGB? :O
14-06-2019T17:03:28,SageSaga,yes
14-06-2019T17:03:34,MatyMaty,Yay!
14-06-2019T17:03:55,SageSaga,i bought the Case
14-06-2019T17:04:27,MatyMaty,which one you got?
14-06-2019T17:05:00,SageSaga,https://c1.neweggimages.com/NeweggImage/ProductImage/11-119-349-V13.jpg
14-06-2019T17:05:23,MatyMaty,yumm
14-06-2019T17:05:24,AspiringNoodle,That's the one I'm considering too
14-06-2019T17:05:27,AspiringNoodle,Lots of airflow :D
14-06-2019T17:05:38,SageSaga,the main reasons i wanted it- the 2 giant 200mm fans
14-06-2019T17:05:44,AspiringNoodle,^^^^^^
14-06-2019T17:06:06,AspiringNoodle,"As far as I know, that thing is just shy of being considered a full tower"
14-06-2019T17:06:06,SageSaga,the computers i built for my father and grandmother- both had a single 200mm fan
14-06-2019T17:06:24,SageSaga,and they are sooooooo quiet but push so much air
14-06-2019T17:06:48,SageSaga,i cant even hear if their computers are on standing next to them
14-06-2019T17:06:57,Kolilakus,mhm
14-06-2019T17:07:11,SageSaga,second reason for that case-
14-06-2019T17:07:18,SageSaga,the front panel IO
14-06-2019T17:07:29,SageSaga,4 USB 3 ports and 1 USB-C port!
14-06-2019T17:09:03,SageSaga,its also not on the top- the front panel is slanted
14-06-2019T17:09:14,Bgrmystr2,"I'm not really sold on front IO. But that's simply due to every single tower I've ever owned, the front IO died."
14-06-2019T17:09:36,SageSaga,ive never had a front IO die
14-06-2019T17:09:38,Bgrmystr2,"I want it, but history of burning multiple flash drives"
14-06-2019T17:10:17,Bgrmystr2,"I've got four separate towers with front IO that's dead, three fried flash drives and a dead external HDD"
14-06-2019T17:10:46,SageSaga,sounds like you had bad luck
14-06-2019T17:10:52,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, unfortunately."
14-06-2019T17:11:34,MatyMaty,"oooh, that sounds great sage!"
14-06-2019T17:11:53,SageSaga,i like the slanted IO especially because i use a finger print scanner that plugs in via USB
14-06-2019T17:11:58,Bgrmystr2,but that's the reason why I'm not miffed if a tower doesn't have it. I haven't been able to use front IO to any reasonable measure.. and I just expect it to die again lol
14-06-2019T17:12:07,SageSaga,so having it closer and at an angle that wont be uncomfortable is good
14-06-2019T17:13:02,SageSaga,oh it also has a GPU resting bracket
14-06-2019T17:13:31,SageSaga,to support the GPU to prevent sagging which can damage the PCIe Slot
14-06-2019T17:13:34,SpazztasticKiwi,✌🏻
14-06-2019T17:13:36,SageSaga,or the gpu
14-06-2019T17:13:41,SpazztasticKiwi,till 8
14-06-2019T17:13:56,SpazztasticKiwi,later Sage
14-06-2019T17:14:00,SageSaga,take care!
14-06-2019T17:15:06,RimaDraws,bye kiwi
14-06-2019T17:20:36,TeapotOfDoom,Well I'm awai for the night. Bye!
14-06-2019T17:21:09,SageSaga,take care TeapotofDOOOOOM
14-06-2019T17:21:20,AspiringNoodle,It's really sad when you think about it.  Part of the blame for sag lies with case manufacturers :/
14-06-2019T17:21:41,SageSaga,how so?
14-06-2019T17:22:14,AspiringNoodle,JayzTwoCents had a video covering this.  Those little slots that act as a guard and help slot the card into the case?
14-06-2019T17:22:43,SageSaga,what about em?
14-06-2019T17:23:14,AspiringNoodle,The case can actually act as a support.  Depends on whether or not the slots for them are a tight fit or not.
14-06-2019T17:23:51,AspiringNoodle,"If the slots are really wide, the card will sag.  Tight fit, no lag."
14-06-2019T17:23:57,AspiringNoodle,sag*
14-06-2019T17:24:07,AspiringNoodle,Let me go find it
14-06-2019T17:25:09,SageSaga,i like Jay- i can look it up later
14-06-2019T17:25:48,AspiringNoodle,JayzTwoCents shows why some GPU's sag: https://youtu.be/EOXYE3hx_JY?t=185
14-06-2019T17:26:00,AspiringNoodle,Even linked you to the part that's relevant <3
14-06-2019T17:26:32,SageSaga,couldnt hit pause fast enough
14-06-2019T17:26:36,SageSaga,so GC everyone!
14-06-2019T17:27:29,Bgrmystr2,GC. I'm sold. Take my non-existant :dollar:
14-06-2019T17:28:24,SageSaga,hmm - should i get a GPU riser?
14-06-2019T17:28:38,RazorToshiba,hmm?
14-06-2019T17:29:00,RazorToshiba,is your GPU worth doing that with? :thinking:
14-06-2019T17:29:11,SageSaga,well when i buy it - probably...
14-06-2019T17:29:57,SageSaga,gonna try and get a 2080 or equivalent
14-06-2019T17:30:24,Bgrmystr2,"does the riser lower the ability of the card in any way? Cuz if not, then I don't see why not."
14-06-2019T17:31:08,AspiringNoodle,"LinusTechTips tested risers, lmao"
14-06-2019T17:31:10,SageSaga,they dont- but they can depending on your setup help with air flow
14-06-2019T17:31:54,AspiringNoodle,"I think at one point they linked together over 10 of them, and saw negligible performance loss"
14-06-2019T17:31:55,SageSaga,"the only reason to use them is to put them in a place to display, or to put them in a place you normally couldnt- or to get them out of the way"
14-06-2019T17:32:12,AspiringNoodle,It was actually really funny
14-06-2019T17:32:17,AspiringNoodle,Desktop: Counter
14-06-2019T17:32:21,AspiringNoodle,GPU: OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM.
14-06-2019T17:32:29,RazorToshiba,"yeah, i had to use a riser for my retro style all in one build"
14-06-2019T17:33:46,SageSaga,most non-blower coolers pull air onto the heat sync on the card right?
14-06-2019T17:34:04,SageSaga,i guess technically blowers do that too but they channel it-
