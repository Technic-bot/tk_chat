14-07-2019T00:35:13,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
14-07-2019T00:36:08,BadFoMo,Good night?
14-07-2019T00:40:22,SpazztasticKiwi,sleep like your life depends on it
14-07-2019T01:18:55,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-nataniAAAAshake:
14-07-2019T02:08:04,SpazztasticKiwi,no yelling after curfew
14-07-2019T02:21:42,SpazztasticKiwi,🛌
14-07-2019T02:25:44,TeapotOfDoom,Morning peeps
14-07-2019T02:27:02,TeapotOfDoom,Also i just woke up. I yell all i want :ctwokinds-sleepoverA:
14-07-2019T02:56:04,DarthRexKing,Goodnight. :V
14-07-2019T03:58:08,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-natsducky:
14-07-2019T05:58:40,AspiringNoodle,I haf returned
14-07-2019T06:02:00,Orthonox,"Morning, lads"
14-07-2019T06:21:02,AspiringNoodle,It's so weird waking up this early
14-07-2019T06:21:27,AspiringNoodle,"At this point, I'm used to my college sleep schedule of go to sleep at 1, wake up at 9 - 10"
14-07-2019T07:00:44,AspiringNoodle,I think I'm about done with the idea of putting RGB into my next build
14-07-2019T07:41:19,AspiringNoodle,"Until all these companies pull their heads out of their collective asses and work to make a universal ecosystem, it's just not worth it..."
14-07-2019T07:57:12,CrimsonQuill,Good day
14-07-2019T07:57:19,CrimsonQuill,How many Tom picks were there?
14-07-2019T08:04:27,AspiringNoodle,...I actually don't remember ;_;
14-07-2019T08:06:56,TeapotOfDoom,Hoi noodle and quill
14-07-2019T08:07:35,TeapotOfDoom,"If you wanna use rbg, use the mainboard header and as many things from one vendor as possibel"
14-07-2019T08:08:00,TeapotOfDoom,as far as i know asus aurora is the biggest one as far as i know
14-07-2019T08:08:06,TeapotOfDoom,as far as i know
14-07-2019T08:13:01,AspiringNoodle,I'm just getting one giant headache from thinking about my new computer...
14-07-2019T08:13:13,AspiringNoodle,"Like, the absurd level of complexity RGB adds is completely unacceptable"
14-07-2019T08:14:04,AspiringNoodle,"You shouldn't have to worry about needing multiple pieces of software to control lighting for everything, and compatibility because each vendor likes using its own proprietary connectors -_-"
14-07-2019T08:14:52,AspiringNoodle,Eventually I'm gonna reach my eff it point and build a computer with little concern for how everything looks together because screw the system
14-07-2019T08:17:05,TeapotOfDoom,Again use standard rgb headers
14-07-2019T08:17:16,TeapotOfDoom,Or stay with one vendor
14-07-2019T08:17:34,TeapotOfDoom,But yes why the heck is there no standard?
14-07-2019T08:18:56,AspiringNoodle,"Probably because every single vendors wants to strong-arm you into their ecosystem, because otherwise they'd lose sales"
14-07-2019T08:19:09,AspiringNoodle,Off the top of my head
14-07-2019T08:19:32,AspiringNoodle,"MSI Mystic Light, Gigabyte RGB Fusion, ASUS Aura Sync, Corsair iCUE"
14-07-2019T08:20:31,AspiringNoodle,"And while some parts from different vendors are compatible with a given software, there's no real way to unify your entire system under one standard without severely limiting part choices"
14-07-2019T08:21:08,AspiringNoodle,"Example: ASUS's system works well if you have their mobo, gpu, and use G.skill memory"
14-07-2019T08:21:22,AspiringNoodle,"But once you go to CPU coolers and fans, I'm not sure what parts work"
14-07-2019T08:22:17,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-nibrun::ctwokinds-nibrun:
14-07-2019T08:23:03,AspiringNoodle,"But yeah, it's absolutely ridiculous that there's no way to have your entire build's RGB controlled by ONE software"
14-07-2019T08:25:01,CrimsonQuill,Hiya Teapit
14-07-2019T08:25:10,CrimsonQuill,Teapot
14-07-2019T08:25:18,CrimsonQuill,Didn't see earlier message sorry
14-07-2019T08:25:25,CrimsonQuill,Was trying out SPV3
14-07-2019T08:28:26,AspiringNoodle,"Okay, so apparently there is a way to use one ecosystem"
14-07-2019T08:29:48,AspiringNoodle,"If you use what I described above, and use Cooler Master coolers / fans, then you can have a build all controlled by ASUS Aura.  That said, Cooler Master fans ugly as sin."
14-07-2019T08:34:40,TeapotOfDoom,if the fans use standard four lead wires i'm pretty sure it will work with asus
14-07-2019T08:35:00,AspiringNoodle,"Nope, just checked."
14-07-2019T08:35:06,TeapotOfDoom,really?
14-07-2019T08:35:15,AspiringNoodle,"Corsair's RGB RAMwill work with Asus Aura, but not the fans"
14-07-2019T08:35:28,TeapotOfDoom,i mean there may be no software standard but the hardware behind it is mostly standard
14-07-2019T08:35:43,TeapotOfDoom,but why...
14-07-2019T08:35:51,TeapotOfDoom,:ctwokinds-keifacepalm:
14-07-2019T08:37:34,CrimsonQuill,I don't really know what any of this means...
14-07-2019T08:37:40,AspiringNoodle,https://linustechtips.com/main/topic/927212-ultimate-guide-to-fan-rpm-rgb-ecosystems/
14-07-2019T08:37:43,CrimsonQuill,But I think I'm in love with Halo SPV3
14-07-2019T08:37:52,AspiringNoodle,Check out how different fan manufacturers handle RGB ecosystems
14-07-2019T08:38:52,AspiringNoodle,"Thermaltake seems to have the best setup possible, and I don't actually hate the looks of their fans"
14-07-2019T08:39:56,CrimsonQuill,brb
14-07-2019T08:42:13,AspiringNoodle,"But yeah, aRGB is broken as all hell.  Everyone wants customers to use their ecosystem, and the limited compatibility makes it hard to unify a build"
14-07-2019T08:42:31,AspiringNoodle,"At this point, it seems like it's easier to forsake RGB wherever possible, or to use static lighting"
14-07-2019T08:56:26,SniperJackal,@CrimsonQuill so you played SPV3?
14-07-2019T09:01:03,AspiringNoodle,Just had a thought
14-07-2019T09:01:14,AspiringNoodle,"If Corsair ever started making motherboards / gpus, I'd be set xD"
14-07-2019T09:01:26,CrimsonQuill,@SniperJackal Just got it last night
14-07-2019T09:01:33,SniperJackal,enjoy it
14-07-2019T09:01:35,SniperJackal,I did
14-07-2019T09:01:36,CrimsonQuill,But didn't get a chance to play it till toda
14-07-2019T09:01:38,CrimsonQuill,today
14-07-2019T09:01:48,CrimsonQuill,Becuase I was watching the stream
14-07-2019T09:01:50,SniperJackal,The Lumoria missions have a lot of cool weapons
14-07-2019T09:02:11,CrimsonQuill,"I love the weapons, the music.."
14-07-2019T09:02:17,CrimsonQuill,My aim sucks though
14-07-2019T09:03:11,SniperJackal,so you didnt play SPV3.1 before?
14-07-2019T09:03:34,CrimsonQuill,No
14-07-2019T09:03:36,CrimsonQuill,No
14-07-2019T09:03:43,SniperJackal,"Well it doesnt matter, .2 is much better"
14-07-2019T09:03:53,CrimsonQuill,Didn't even realise that it was a pc mod till Bgrmystr2 told me
14-07-2019T09:03:58,SniperJackal,anyways have fun with it
14-07-2019T09:04:11,CrimsonQuill,Thanks
14-07-2019T09:04:15,SniperJackal,I do recommend starting with normal tho
14-07-2019T09:04:40,SniperJackal,Or If you wanna commit suicide and complete all missions on noble
14-07-2019T09:04:51,CrimsonQuill,I'm on Heroic
14-07-2019T09:04:56,CrimsonQuill,I might try Nobl
14-07-2019T09:04:57,CrimsonQuill,Noble
14-07-2019T09:04:58,SniperJackal,Thats ok too
14-07-2019T09:05:06,CrimsonQuill,I love how there is no 'easy'
14-07-2019T09:05:09,CrimsonQuill,Makes sense
14-07-2019T09:05:14,SniperJackal,"I did the original 10 missions on noble, absolute fuckfest"
14-07-2019T09:05:14,CrimsonQuill,How hard is Noble?
14-07-2019T09:05:29,CrimsonQuill,That hard?
14-07-2019T09:05:31,SniperJackal,"Its extremely hard, but I liked the challenge :P"
14-07-2019T09:05:33,CrimsonQuill,As in Halo 2 hard?
14-07-2019T09:05:39,SniperJackal,Not really
14-07-2019T09:05:43,SniperJackal,I mean
14-07-2019T09:05:52,SniperJackal,It can be unfair
14-07-2019T09:06:00,SniperJackal,But you dont get 1 shotted by snipers
14-07-2019T09:06:03,CrimsonQuill,I fear Halo 2 legendary
14-07-2019T09:06:18,SniperJackal,Grunts are also very deadly on noble
14-07-2019T09:06:27,CrimsonQuill,Never underestimate grunts
14-07-2019T09:06:29,SniperJackal,they spam plasma pistols like crazy
14-07-2019T09:06:32,CrimsonQuill,Do they carry Fuel Rods?
14-07-2019T09:06:45,SniperJackal,I think they dont in this version
14-07-2019T09:06:50,CrimsonQuill,Ok
14-07-2019T09:06:58,SniperJackal,But on Two betrayals they sometimes carry rocket launchers
14-07-2019T09:07:02,SniperJackal,so even worse
14-07-2019T09:07:05,CrimsonQuill,HELPP
14-07-2019T09:07:13,SniperJackal,And brutes aswell
14-07-2019T09:07:20,SniperJackal,sometimes
14-07-2019T09:07:42,SniperJackal,"anyways, I dont wanna ruin too much"
14-07-2019T09:07:53,CrimsonQuill,I saw the Brutes
14-07-2019T09:08:02,CrimsonQuill,Nice to see them as they would have been in the fleet
14-07-2019T09:08:10,SniperJackal,yeah they arent as op as in Halo 2
14-07-2019T09:08:13,CrimsonQuill,But they are bullet sponges
14-07-2019T09:08:29,SniperJackal,dmr or br + headshots
14-07-2019T09:08:32,CrimsonQuill,"And those Grifshots....Umm, I mean Bruteshots!"
14-07-2019T09:08:42,SniperJackal,grifshots :O
14-07-2019T09:08:51,CrimsonQuill,Red vs Blue
14-07-2019T09:09:01,SniperJackal,yeah I know about grifball
14-07-2019T09:09:19,CrimsonQuill,I was really annoyed when i tried it on Reach though
14-07-2019T09:09:28,CrimsonQuill,Hardly any matches have people actually play the game
14-07-2019T09:09:42,CrimsonQuill,"They just grab the bomb, and farm XP rather than bring it to the goal"
14-07-2019T09:09:58,CrimsonQuill,And teamkilling out of spite
14-07-2019T09:10:07,CrimsonQuill,I had one match like that
14-07-2019T09:10:23,SniperJackal,Im gonna try it out when it comes to pc
14-07-2019T09:10:59,SniperJackal,soon™
14-07-2019T09:11:10,CrimsonQuill,:)
14-07-2019T09:44:23,AspiringNoodle,FINALLY starting to watch anime again
14-07-2019T09:44:36,AspiringNoodle,Already freaking out 3 minutes into S2 of One Punch Man
14-07-2019T09:49:57,AspiringNoodle,Aaaaaaaaaand did not see that twist coming.  And somehow I love King even more now.
14-07-2019T09:50:13,CrimsonQuill,:)
14-07-2019T09:52:51,AspiringNoodle,One thing I love about One Punch Man is the total subversion of Saitama's capabilities
14-07-2019T09:53:42,AspiringNoodle,"He's so strong that most people can't accept it, and they have to rationalize it away"
14-07-2019T10:30:05,MisterWho,"@AspiringNoodle: Sooo, you're not reading the manga? Then wait for S3. *GRINS*"
14-07-2019T10:32:33,AspiringNoodle,"Alas, I have no more room for manga :("
14-07-2019T10:32:40,TeapotOfDoom,I still have to catch up on opm s2
14-07-2019T10:32:43,AspiringNoodle,"Which is a shame, because there's some series I have that I'd LOVE to finish"
14-07-2019T10:32:56,TeapotOfDoom,I watched the first three episodes and they are amazing
14-07-2019T10:33:23,AspiringNoodle,I love that other heroes are realizing just how powerful he is
14-07-2019T10:33:30,AspiringNoodle,"It's like, ""YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAS, RECOGNITIOOOOOOOOON!!!"""
14-07-2019T12:18:26,TeapotOfDoom,Now finally on my way home
14-07-2019T12:18:57,TeapotOfDoom,I was so in the zone until now completely forgot the time
14-07-2019T13:10:10,Orthonox,Sweet that you are watching S2 of OPM. I'm thinking about rewatching the show.
14-07-2019T13:10:21,CrimsonQuill,Tea time
14-07-2019T13:10:25,CrimsonQuill,:ctwokinds-kingtea:
14-07-2019T13:10:30,CrimsonQuill,I am so happy
14-07-2019T13:10:43,CrimsonQuill,I finally got the poses in my picture right after ages
14-07-2019T13:10:56,CrimsonQuill,And I am almost able to start inking
14-07-2019T13:21:21,CrimsonQuill,"Now...time to get the trousers scared off of me with Alien Isolation,"

14-07-2019T16:00:59,SpazztasticKiwi,studying vacation points. Cinci is over 500 miles closer than my other option
14-07-2019T16:04:53,AspiringNoodle,"The more logical explanation is that as an assassin, he probably doesn't like it when things aren't in his control :P"
14-07-2019T16:31:51,Orthonox,"Given their assassin career from what we have seen, I cannot think there was ever a moment where the 'Magi Brothers' had anything in their control."
14-07-2019T17:09:41,Twokinds,Okay! All Patreon sketches scheduled for the next week
14-07-2019T17:09:50,Twokinds,So that's taken care of.
