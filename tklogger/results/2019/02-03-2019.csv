02-03-2019T13:57:41,CrimsonQuill,Suddenly it seems very quiet.
02-03-2019T13:57:51,Twokinds,Well I'm waiting for you to elaborate.
02-03-2019T13:58:03,CrimsonQuill,Ah.
02-03-2019T13:58:07,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-keith8D:
02-03-2019T13:58:11,Twokinds,Don't just say that. Don't say you have something to say and then don't say it.
02-03-2019T13:58:14,CrimsonQuill,"Well, you remember Halo Raine a while back...A"
02-03-2019T13:58:42,CrimsonQuill,And then I drew Halo Kessah from Salamanstra...
02-03-2019T13:58:55,CrimsonQuill,I've drawn the next member of their fireteam.
02-03-2019T13:59:20,CrimsonQuill,"You see, I decided to create a whole fireteam out of it."
02-03-2019T13:59:24,CrimsonQuill,Fireteam Luna.
02-03-2019T13:59:38,CrimsonQuill,"And basically, this new person is an original character."
02-03-2019T13:59:47,CrimsonQuill,Who's their team commander.
02-03-2019T13:59:58,RimaDraws,i thought ocs werent allowed?
02-03-2019T14:00:11,CrimsonQuill,It's not a sketch suggestion
02-03-2019T14:00:17,RimaDraws,ah
02-03-2019T14:00:18,CrimsonQuill,It's something I've drawn and coloured
02-03-2019T14:00:28,CrimsonQuill,I'm posting it on my DevArt tonight
02-03-2019T14:00:30,RimaDraws,i apologize
02-03-2019T14:00:49,CrimsonQuill,I just thought that Tom might be interested to know that Spartan Raine now has a commander.
02-03-2019T14:01:38,CrimsonQuill,He's basically the first Spartan-IV on Infinity not to be racist just because Spartans Raine and Kessah have a few Wolf characteristics...
02-03-2019T14:01:42,CrimsonQuill,That sort of thing...
02-03-2019T14:01:46,Twokinds,I see
02-03-2019T14:01:51,Twokinds,That's cool
02-03-2019T14:01:57,CrimsonQuill,Glad you like it.

02-03-2019T14:06:54,CrimsonQuill,Indeed.
02-03-2019T14:07:10,CrimsonQuill,My Dad's also told me firmly that I really need to calm down...
02-03-2019T14:07:27,RimaDraws,take up a few things? such as?
02-03-2019T14:07:31,CrimsonQuill,Leeeeeet's just say that this last fortnight I've been a bit....panicky.
02-03-2019T14:07:47,CrimsonQuill,"Oh-I want to take up writing a bit more, working harder, drawing more...."
02-03-2019T14:07:52,RimaDraws,oh thats good!
02-03-2019T14:07:52,CrimsonQuill,And cooking more Spaghetti
02-03-2019T14:07:57,RimaDraws,i would love to see you draw more

02-03-2019T14:08:09,CrimsonQuill,I'm flattered that you like it.

02-03-2019T14:08:23,CrimsonQuill,Oops
02-03-2019T14:08:31,CrimsonQuill,A second one tried to sneak in
02-03-2019T14:08:34,RimaDraws,im not catholic so i wouldn't be doing lent. but i know that its a time for catholics to fast i think
02-03-2019T14:08:41,CrimsonQuill,Yes.
02-03-2019T14:08:51,RimaDraws,they dont eat anything but fish?
02-03-2019T14:08:54,RimaDraws,i believe
02-03-2019T14:08:59,CrimsonQuill,On certain days.
02-03-2019T14:09:11,RimaDraws,yea because beef is a no no
02-03-2019T14:09:16,CrimsonQuill,Ash Wednesday and Good Friday.
02-03-2019T14:09:27,RimaDraws,no beef on those days?
02-03-2019T14:09:39,CrimsonQuill,"I might try a mostly fish or veg diet throughout the time...also, no, no beef."
02-03-2019T14:09:50,RimaDraws,so i may try that then
02-03-2019T14:10:00,RimaDraws,no pork or beef and just chicken and fish
02-03-2019T14:10:14,CrimsonQuill,No chicken
02-03-2019T14:10:18,RimaDraws,oh well crap
02-03-2019T14:10:18,CrimsonQuill,Chicken counts
02-03-2019T14:10:33,CrimsonQuill,"Mind, salmon tastes marvellous with a bit of lemon."
02-03-2019T14:10:33,RimaDraws,darn it
02-03-2019T14:10:40,RimaDraws,i love salmon <3
02-03-2019T14:10:51,CrimsonQuill,Or trout...
02-03-2019T14:11:01,CrimsonQuill,Cod I wouldn't go for-heavily overfished
02-03-2019T14:11:05,RimaDraws,then again my diet has chicken and i already cooked up my stuff for the week
02-03-2019T14:11:25,CrimsonQuill,I used to cook in bulk and eat the same thing day after day.
02-03-2019T14:11:33,RimaDraws,i forgot lent started this week
02-03-2019T14:11:33,CrimsonQuill,"Now I cook in bulk, but in different batched."
02-03-2019T14:11:43,CrimsonQuill,So I never eat the same thing two days in a row.
02-03-2019T14:11:57,CrimsonQuill,"Also, where did Natani go in the Stream Offline?"
02-03-2019T14:12:10,CrimsonQuill,It has been changing a lot recently.
02-03-2019T14:12:12,RimaDraws,its a new picture lol
02-03-2019T14:12:16,Twokinds,I dunno
02-03-2019T14:12:17,CrimsonQuill,Yeah...
02-03-2019T14:12:22,Twokinds,I am working on the budget for building a new Twokinds machine.
02-03-2019T14:12:23,TerraTheWizard,kat put her in the washer
02-03-2019T14:12:28,RimaDraws,LOL

02-03-2019T14:14:08,Xexanoth,and the one after that is natani coming back seeing him wearing the panties

02-03-2019T14:16:42,RimaDraws,since i didnt do a vote
02-03-2019T14:17:23,tehbear,put an m2 or pcie ssd in your new machine Tom. They are super fast. should help saving/loading art

02-03-2019T14:19:38,CrimsonQuill,ummm
02-03-2019T14:19:51,TerraTheWizard,i should really put the descripton in from the FA post

02-03-2019T14:21:16,CrimsonQuill,Hi Mippy
02-03-2019T14:21:28,Twokinds,https://pcpartpicker.com/list/RFJfzY Here's the current work-in-progress plan for The Nora mk3
02-03-2019T14:21:50,RimaDraws,oh neato
02-03-2019T14:22:09,CrimsonQuill,Woah.
02-03-2019T14:22:28,RimaDraws,i want to build my own but i am unsure of what i want to do
02-03-2019T14:22:44,Twokinds,Honestly I would like 64GB of RAM but I'm trying to keep the build under 2k
02-03-2019T14:23:07,CrimsonQuill,I have a laptop that I got upgraded with an SSD and 12gb ram to run Autodesk
02-03-2019T14:23:13,RimaDraws,so is it cheaper to build than to buy one with that already made?
02-03-2019T14:23:27,Twokinds,"Almost always, yeah."
02-03-2019T14:23:50,RimaDraws,i think sage said it was better to build one
02-03-2019T14:23:53,iliar,"Just in case. When choosing M.2 disk, you should pay attention to the interface. M.2 is a form factor, but this type can be disk with the SATA interface or PCIE. SATA - more cheaper, PCIE - faster."

02-03-2019T14:25:10,RimaDraws,hi illiar
02-03-2019T14:25:43,iliar,650W... I would take more.
02-03-2019T14:26:12,Twokinds,Think so?
02-03-2019T14:26:22,Twokinds,We were considering the 750w
02-03-2019T14:27:56,RimaDraws,see computer talk confuses me. i wish i had that knowledge
02-03-2019T14:30:32,SpazztasticKiwi,I only barely follow along cause of Seán playing that Computer Builder Simulator
02-03-2019T14:30:47,dirkalcstreams,What's this? I didn't know there were chat's here offline :thinking:
02-03-2019T14:31:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Had to rewind most points but I followed
02-03-2019T14:31:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Mostly
02-03-2019T14:32:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Though since I just got back from driving - that’s a gorgeous Carman Rima
02-03-2019T14:32:28,SpazztasticKiwi,And Terra you got some cute stuff
02-03-2019T14:32:30,iliar,"In fact, I also need to buy a new computer for a long time. But when I come to the store, I suddenly feel sorry for spending money on it."

02-03-2019T14:33:19,RimaDraws,aw thanks kiwi
02-03-2019T14:34:13,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve laid off my work but I can see everyone else moving theirs up
02-03-2019T14:35:21,RimaDraws,oh i just work on it lol. you will get there
02-03-2019T14:36:24,Xexanoth,"i still need to fix mine, but i'm always like ""it still works good enough"" and then don't wanna spend the money..."
02-03-2019T14:36:25,Dadrobit,"Looking at your mobo, I do feel a bit sketched out. Their promotional material just has too many ""Graphs"" that provide zero meaningful data."
02-03-2019T14:36:27,Mippy,"Yeah, Kiwi,keep it up,"
02-03-2019T14:36:54,Dadrobit,And the one at the bottom about their onboard audio is actual nonsense.
02-03-2019T14:37:06,Twokinds,What would you recommend
02-03-2019T14:37:23,iliar,"By the way, Tom. I seen you rework ""let sleeping dragon"" sketch. I think Nora's head is turned too far. It does not look like a comfortable posture."
02-03-2019T14:37:57,SpazztasticKiwi,"There’s no much reason to. I don’t make anything off it and as a hobby, it’s not much with the time now"
02-03-2019T14:38:04,Twokinds,Alright
02-03-2019T14:38:29,Dadrobit,"I'm sorry, I don't really have one. I haven't built a computer in years and I'm in the middle of looking for a decent reliable base to build off of myself."

02-03-2019T14:44:35,CrimsonQuill,I want to improve the armour
02-03-2019T14:44:41,CrimsonQuill,I made a few slip ups...

02-03-2019T14:53:16,SpazztasticKiwi,I channeled some cute for this suggestion
02-03-2019T14:53:28,SpazztasticKiwi,with a dash of spring
02-03-2019T14:53:30,RimaDraws,yayy
02-03-2019T14:55:29,Mippy,I went back to Kat this time
02-03-2019T15:00:58,RimaDraws,im doing another rose and raine one. which i think everyone will be sick of once i get alot of them
02-03-2019T15:10:36,Apostrophe,I can't imagine ever getting sick of Rose and Raine
02-03-2019T15:12:39,SpazztasticKiwi,"If you’ve never seen a video of a wild robin warming its wee self under a farmers heat lamp for lambs, it’s precious"
02-03-2019T15:12:53,tehbear,"@Tom, instead of that MSI mobo, I would recommend the ASUS ROG Strix B360-F. It has two M.2 ports, (the MSI has just 1)."
02-03-2019T15:15:23,tehbear,besides that they are pretty much identical AFAICT
02-03-2019T15:19:07,Twokinds,The MSI one has two
02-03-2019T15:20:24,Twokinds,Oh
02-03-2019T15:20:29,Twokinds,I thought it had two
02-03-2019T15:20:38,Mandag,Kek
02-03-2019T15:21:37,Twokinds,I also looked at the strix
02-03-2019T15:23:50,tehbear,"hmm. looked again at the b360 strix, im afraid the chipset wont support an i9 cpu :( sorry"
02-03-2019T15:23:57,Twokinds,Ah
02-03-2019T15:24:02,Twokinds,Yeah that's important
02-03-2019T15:24:03,tehbear,picking pc parts isnt easy
02-03-2019T15:24:09,Bgrmystr2,"I would actually recommend waiting to see what AMD comes out with when they release Ryzen 3000, tom"
02-03-2019T15:24:25,Bgrmystr2,cuz I think those chips are going to completely destroy Intel's lineup at stupidly low prices
02-03-2019T15:24:41,Twokinds,Well when is that happening?
02-03-2019T15:24:54,Bgrmystr2,probably around the middle of the year?
02-03-2019T15:25:13,Twokinds,Hm
02-03-2019T15:25:17,Twokinds,I've always use Intel
02-03-2019T15:25:30,Bgrmystr2,"they showed off a demo of their engineer sample at CES in january, and their lower-mid cpu destroyed intel's 9900k like 10% faster or somesuch"
02-03-2019T15:25:56,Twokinds,"I could wait, but that would mean delaying the whole build."
02-03-2019T15:25:58,Bgrmystr2,"and that was just the 8 core sample, not even finalized"
02-03-2019T15:26:17,Bgrmystr2,"they plan a 12, 16, and 32 core from the looks of it"
02-03-2019T15:27:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Building
02-03-2019T15:27:34,Bgrmystr2,"and yeah I figure if you're having computer issues and need to replace something, then it'd be fine to get something replaced, but I'd wait to see what the AMD parts are going to be."
02-03-2019T15:27:50,tehbear,photoshop shows diminishing returns after more than 4 cores. 6 cores is only 8% faster than 4 cores
02-03-2019T15:27:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Makes me think I got to find some way of starting my move out
02-03-2019T15:28:52,Bgrmystr2,probably because intel's processors don't really give any benefit for the higher core count
02-03-2019T15:29:14,Bgrmystr2,"they've been trying to keep everyone on 4 cores, only reason they stopped is Ryzen"
02-03-2019T15:29:21,qwe304,any particular reason you went with the 9900k?
02-03-2019T15:29:54,qwe304,also i would recomend a better pse
02-03-2019T15:30:01,qwe304,*psu
02-03-2019T15:30:19,Twokinds,I am open for suggestions
02-03-2019T15:31:46,qwe304,well im not sure how well PS is optimized for ryzen so Im hesitant to recomend an amd build
02-03-2019T15:32:37,qwe304,Id recomend a 800w psu for that build
02-03-2019T15:33:27,qwe304,that motherboars does not look like it has the VRM's to handle a 9900k
02-03-2019T15:33:31,Twokinds,Why would it need that much?
02-03-2019T15:34:12,tehbear,it probably wont. but having a beefy psu is good for stability instead of maxing out one that barely just manages
02-03-2019T15:34:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"If it’s for the drawing thing and not your games set up, it may be similar to what Robin uses for his animation and artwork"
02-03-2019T15:35:17,qwe304,"that cpu can reach 200w on its own, without overclocking, iirc"
02-03-2019T15:35:38,tehbear,btw. i found an asus strix mobo that handles the i9: STRIX Z390-F. same chipset as the msi one (z390)
02-03-2019T15:35:43,qwe304,and it just generaly not a great idea to run a psu near its limit
02-03-2019T15:36:09,qwe304,@tehbear how many vrm phases?
02-03-2019T15:38:09,qwe304,psu's are generally the most efficient around 60-70% load
02-03-2019T15:42:49,RandomTonio,Hello
02-03-2019T15:43:19,tehbear,@qwe304 the z390-f has a 4+2 phase design for CPU PWM
02-03-2019T15:43:50,qwe304,that is woefuly underpowered for a 9900k
02-03-2019T15:45:55,Bgrmystr2,At least tom's cpu cooler is gonna be amazing. The noctua fans I hear are bad-fuckin-ass
02-03-2019T15:46:20,MarvTheHugPharaoh,best fans on the market
02-03-2019T15:46:28,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Ello o/
02-03-2019T15:46:35,tehbear,"@qwe304 is it?  kitguru website mentioned the VRM design wasnt the best, but they ran an i9 on it without issues"
02-03-2019T15:46:40,Bgrmystr2,"so I've seen, marv, and heya man"
02-03-2019T15:47:43,tehbear,guess it rules out overclocking tho.
02-03-2019T15:48:53,qwe304,"nevermind, they are doubled vrms,"
02-03-2019T15:49:02,qwe304,not just standard 4+2
02-03-2019T15:49:16,qwe304,than that motherboard should be good for a 9900k
02-03-2019T15:49:17,TorqueEmUp,Yeah more wattage over what you actually need just helps it not work as hard and last longer.
02-03-2019T15:51:25,qwe304,heres a list with a better mobo and psu https://pcpartpicker.com/list/sKfdV6
02-03-2019T15:52:32,TorqueEmUp,"Honestly ""better"" is subjective. MSI boards are good as long as you aren't buying the low end ones. Preferably a Gigabyte board person myself."
02-03-2019T15:52:57,qwe304,i mean better by better vrms
02-03-2019T15:53:08,TorqueEmUp,That's fair
02-03-2019T15:53:32,js199456,he doesnt need an I9 for streaming and drawing
02-03-2019T15:53:45,js199456,i7 7700 is more than enough
02-03-2019T15:53:49,js199456,just saying
02-03-2019T15:53:58,qwe304,and better I/O

02-03-2019T16:04:56,tehbear,yeah. Keith almost killed Zen. so that backfired badly.
02-03-2019T16:05:00,BadFoMo,Due to tec talk.
02-03-2019T16:05:03,Combak,Half hour?

02-03-2019T16:05:28,ThingsAreMoving,Tom just said there's delay

02-03-2019T16:05:38,tehbear,blame it on the nerds
02-03-2019T16:05:43,Mandag,Pretty sure Nat and Zen would've succeeded in their mission had they not run into Trace Fucking Legacy himself.

02-03-2019T16:05:48,NeonMitsumi,At least Keith has his sclera for once.
02-03-2019T16:05:59,CrRAR,Tru
02-03-2019T16:06:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Or maybe he’s using the tech talk excuse as delay cause he’s really just not ready yet
02-03-2019T16:06:17,Mandag,Pretty sure his sclera has been present ever since Natani woke up again #Visualstorytelling
02-03-2019T16:06:40,NeonMitsumi,And once Trace punched him.
02-03-2019T16:06:52,Combak,Wasn't Nat and Zen's mission focused on Trace though?

02-03-2019T16:08:59,BadFoMo,I think so.
02-03-2019T16:09:15,tehbear,and then it changed once they became aware Trace was with her

02-03-2019T16:28:21,Mandag,I love Wasabi and Ben. Best assassin duo.
02-03-2019T16:28:26,tehbear,they could have saved themselves a keystroke and written Mæve

02-03-2019T16:28:32,CrimsonQuill,The armour I designed is called the Bastion

02-03-2019T16:32:22,Mandag,Smaug is a big boy.
02-03-2019T16:32:26,ThingsAreMoving,"Different universes, different powers. Can't quantify their powers"
02-03-2019T16:32:32,Mandag,And he's way smarter in the book than he is in the movies.
02-03-2019T16:32:43,tehbear,Nora would just transform smaug into a keidran lizard
02-03-2019T16:32:46,ThingsAreMoving,impossible to judge the outcome
02-03-2019T16:32:47,Mandag,In the movies he's all ME UNGA SMASH

02-03-2019T16:33:24,tehbear,maybe thats where the lizard in traces house comes from?
02-03-2019T16:33:30,CrimsonQuill,One must admit however that Smaug voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch is a match made in Heaven.
02-03-2019T16:33:38,CrimsonQuill,I doubt that Nora would have it that easily...
02-03-2019T16:33:44,Mandag,You should take Ghostbuster's advice and not cross the streams.
02-03-2019T16:33:48,KitsuneShapeshifter,"if he is immune, i would put my money on smaug"

02-03-2019T16:33:53,tehbear,yeah. Dragons probably have a fair amount of natural magic resist
02-03-2019T16:33:55,CrimsonQuill,The way magic works in Middle Earth is very different.

02-03-2019T16:41:01,Bgrmystr2,"neon is pulling numbers out of nowhere, it's just a guessjoke bro"
02-03-2019T16:41:04,NeonMitsumi,@ThingsAreMoving How could I not remember D­:
02-03-2019T16:41:12,Bgrmystr2,yeah what things said
02-03-2019T16:41:26,NeonMitsumi,"Well, they aren't correct anymore. More have been added."
02-03-2019T16:41:30,ThingsAreMoving,"I'm just happy cause that was my first suggestion, Nyoom"
02-03-2019T16:41:37,Mandag,"But for real, how do you know?"
02-03-2019T16:41:43,NeonMitsumi,I don't. lol
02-03-2019T16:41:48,Mandag,I see.
02-03-2019T16:41:52,Mippy,Neon is MewTwo
02-03-2019T16:42:03,Mandag,Well I suppose we're all in teh same leaking boat then.
02-03-2019T16:42:03,ThingsAreMoving,"Mandag, pick a number from 40~82"
02-03-2019T16:42:06,RandomTonio,So...when do we start?
02-03-2019T16:42:09,Mandag,81
02-03-2019T16:42:13,ThingsAreMoving,we're at 81
02-03-2019T16:42:15,tehbear,40000 / 82
02-03-2019T16:42:17,RandomTonio,When Tom finished loading everything?
02-03-2019T16:42:19,ThingsAreMoving,how did you know? :o
02-03-2019T16:42:28,NeonMitsumi,Kat's acupuncture has woken my chakras.
02-03-2019T16:42:29,Bgrmystr2,"Congratulations, Mandag, you clearly know now just as much as neon does."
02-03-2019T16:42:29,Bgrmystr2,xD
02-03-2019T16:42:33,Mandag,My psychic abilities
02-03-2019T16:42:39,Mippy,When the Tom is finished loading
02-03-2019T16:42:51,Mandag,"""The Tom"""
02-03-2019T16:42:52,ThingsAreMoving,the Tom
02-03-2019T16:42:53,tehbear,this is why he needs an i9
02-03-2019T16:43:00,ThingsAreMoving,or one of his clones
02-03-2019T16:43:15,Mippy,Rumba Tom
02-03-2019T16:43:18,Bgrmystr2,"I don't think the i9 will speed up the process of copy/pasting, bear"
02-03-2019T16:43:25,Mandag,"First we have a bunch of Laura clones, and now there are MULTIPLE TOMS?"
02-03-2019T16:43:26,Bgrmystr2,it's a manual process
02-03-2019T16:43:36,ThingsAreMoving,It's proofreading that takes time methinks
02-03-2019T16:43:43,Bgrmystr2,that too
02-03-2019T16:43:48,Bgrmystr2,which an i9 will not do.
02-03-2019T16:43:58,Mandag,So he just has to make sure there are no lewd ones that are out of character?
02-03-2019T16:43:59,BadFoMo,Two does proofreading?
02-03-2019T16:44:11,ThingsAreMoving,we often give suggestions that balance on lewd/verboten stuff and need to be moderated
02-03-2019T16:44:13,BadFoMo,*Tom
02-03-2019T16:44:18,tehbear,and suggestions that conflict with the future story
02-03-2019T16:44:19,ThingsAreMoving,"yes, FoMo"
02-03-2019T16:44:24,Mandag,Like the one with Raine poledancing?
02-03-2019T16:44:25,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Two does proof read
02-03-2019T16:44:27,Bgrmystr2,"if he never proofread comments, we'd have some completely unreadable suggestions"
02-03-2019T16:45:06,tehbear,"if we had the previously filtered suggestions, we could train a neural network to do the filtering. then an i9 would help"
02-03-2019T16:45:08,ThingsAreMoving,"Two proofreads, One is making burritos and Zero is brewing coffee"
02-03-2019T16:45:13,Mippy,"Like that strange one from awhile ago that was like ""Kairen round the Reni"""
02-03-2019T16:45:18,tehbear,probably need a bigger data set tho.

02-03-2019T18:46:07,CatzArt,Fencing foils have a pointy end thats covered by a ball. Not normally a problem but without it and with enough force it will go into your arm

02-03-2019T19:54:45,BadFoMo,Raine: Oh on! Their's only 4 chips left! I must go get another bag! (after making more cookies she is left with 6 chips.) Raine: AH!
02-03-2019T19:54:49,CountOfDeath,I just got kicked from a server for speaking against the hypocrisies of the NSFW furry community.
02-03-2019T19:54:50,Mippy,I know Catz....I have Pokémon Diamond. It was a joke
02-03-2019T19:54:58,CatzArt,But we can all agree team Rocket is the best
02-03-2019T19:55:01,unsteddyphoenix,Sorry this is a no furry chat
02-03-2019T19:55:04,RimaDraws,TR for the win

02-03-2019T19:55:31,unsteddyphoenix,Nah team skull > rocket
02-03-2019T19:55:37,Mandag,What does it say in the very bottom corner of this stream?
02-03-2019T19:55:38,Mippy,"Yeah, no furries here. Just Pokémon fans arguing over what Team is best"
02-03-2019T19:55:46,CatzArt,"You could say that this is a ""Zen"" chat"
02-03-2019T19:55:50,CountOfDeath,"Yeah, I said go to hell furry fucks!"
02-03-2019T19:55:56,Bgrmystr2,"yes, go ahead and lump all furries together and not at all think that they're different individuals, Count."

02-03-2019T19:59:43,MuonNeutrino,"@Bgrmystr2 i dunno, sounds like she knows *exactly* how to cookies ^^"
02-03-2019T19:59:44,unsteddyphoenix,Just wing it tbh
02-03-2019T19:59:48,Mippy,I usually only save Basitin stuff...for reasons
02-03-2019T19:59:56,Bgrmystr2,"then you're both doin it wrong, Muon"
02-03-2019T19:59:58,Bgrmystr2,cuz it doesn'
02-03-2019T19:59:58,RimaDraws,i made cookies with my nana
02-03-2019T20:00:02,Bgrmystr2,doesn't* gotta be exact
02-03-2019T20:00:05,RimaDraws,and my aunt when i was a kid
02-03-2019T20:00:07,Bgrmystr2,"if it's exact, you have boring cookies."
02-03-2019T20:00:08,ThingsAreMoving,Cookies need freestyling
02-03-2019T20:00:12,MuonNeutrino,"doesn't *gotta*, but it *can* be ^^"

02-03-2019T20:00:26,TheBeckoner,like from scratch
02-03-2019T20:00:28,RimaDraws,i can relate to this a bit and see rose as more an aunt than a cousin to raine.
02-03-2019T20:00:30,MuonNeutrino,and i would submit that raine is certainly being very exact in her cookieing ^^%
02-03-2019T20:00:31,ThingsAreMoving,"that's deep wisdom, bgr"
02-03-2019T20:00:37,CatzArt,Now I just want cookies
02-03-2019T20:00:43,MuonNeutrino,"i never said that's how you *must* do it, but that's the way she *is* doing it"
02-03-2019T20:00:46,MuonNeutrino,very exactly
02-03-2019T20:00:47,unsteddyphoenix,"Shes a second cousin, which is basically an aunt"
02-03-2019T20:00:48,Mippy,I made cookies on my own because mom always burns them

02-03-2019T21:45:14,ProsePro7,Wait what is this?
02-03-2019T21:45:26,FreelancerAgentMaine,Is Tom pick basically just pity on a sketch that didn't win
02-03-2019T21:45:35,ThingsAreMoving,why call it pity?
02-03-2019T21:45:35,unsteddyphoenix,Thats one way to put it sure
02-03-2019T21:45:38,NeonMitsumi,It happens sometimes.
02-03-2019T21:45:43,Bgrmystr2,"technically no, but it's his choice."
02-03-2019T21:45:43,CharaIsNotEvil,it wont load
02-03-2019T21:45:52,RimaDraws,mine was tom picked...
02-03-2019T21:45:57,Bgrmystr2,"Tom picks what he wants to draw. Sometimes it's a pity pick, sometimes it's not."
02-03-2019T21:45:58,Ordithus,Honestly surprised it never won by vote
02-03-2019T21:46:01,ProsePro7,I will be more than happy for pity

02-03-2019T21:46:07,MuonNeutrino,@FreelancerAgentMaine tom pick is whatever tom wants. it has no discernable relationship to anything
02-03-2019T21:46:08,Ordithus,"But, we are more thirsty for ladies than gentelman"
02-03-2019T21:46:12,Mippy,Someone was very determined to get this made and I thank them

02-03-2019T23:29:22,SpazztasticKiwi,That brings more questions than answered anything
02-03-2019T23:29:29,qwe304,I would recomend considering an aio water cooler though
02-03-2019T23:29:40,Bgrmystr2,"it wasn't modeled with wings, kiwi"
02-03-2019T23:29:48,Bgrmystr2,so no big deal there
02-03-2019T23:29:48,qwe304,though they can cost a pretty penny
02-03-2019T23:30:14,CrRAR,"Yeah, plus upkeep sometimes"
02-03-2019T23:30:34,Twokinds,I see
02-03-2019T23:30:42,Bgrmystr2,I'd just go with a Noctua. They have similar temps as liquid cooling from what I've seen
02-03-2019T23:30:48,Bgrmystr2,they're just stupidly beefy coolers
02-03-2019T23:31:12,CrRAR,"Yeah, air cooling is fine because it's set and forget."
02-03-2019T23:31:23,qwe304,"there are legitimate reasons to go with either,"
02-03-2019T23:31:24,Bgrmystr2,and don't gotta worry about messing with the liquid cooling if/when you change the liquid inside
02-03-2019T23:31:30,Bgrmystr2,but yeh either one
02-03-2019T23:31:33,qwe304,just wanted to recomend considering it
02-03-2019T23:31:34,Bgrmystr2,both are great
02-03-2019T23:31:43,TheBeckoner,I like water cooling for a clean look personally
02-03-2019T23:31:45,Ordithus,I've never bothered with liquid cooling myself
02-03-2019T23:31:54,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Noctua may not have the best colors but they work like a dream
02-03-2019T23:32:00,CrRAR,"If you want ultimate quiet, water cool~"

02-03-2019T23:32:22,CrRAR,yeah they have dem ridged blades for reduced turbulence~
02-03-2019T23:32:26,Ordithus,"My PC is decently quiet aircooled.  But I don't overclock, so"
02-03-2019T23:32:28,MarvTheHugPharaoh,you can also get a beefy all in one liquid cooler

02-03-2019T23:32:45,TheBeckoner,you can clean an aio too?
02-03-2019T23:33:00,Bgrmystr2,yeah but metal fins will not fail
02-03-2019T23:33:01,Ordithus,That mixing~
02-03-2019T23:33:05,Bgrmystr2,they won't make you buy more
02-03-2019T23:33:11,Bgrmystr2,you just air them out and they work again
02-03-2019T23:33:11,CrRAR,Is it Ord I just though CFMs mattered

02-03-2019T23:54:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Only reason I didn’t put that and said asking race about the mop is I know Trace wouldn’t do that

02-03-2019T23:54:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Though he’d likely look at Rose for the answer cause he’s likely not to know
