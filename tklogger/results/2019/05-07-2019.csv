05-07-2019T15:46:18,IronHorseComics,good night
05-07-2019T15:46:48,TerraTheWizard,o/
05-07-2019T16:14:33,TeapotOfDoom,Aw just missed quill
05-07-2019T16:14:37,TeapotOfDoom,Hi y'all
05-07-2019T16:14:59,TeapotOfDoom,guess who just messed up a nice pair of white shorts with some blood
05-07-2019T16:16:23,TeapotOfDoom,Also wow deviantart got some new design. Nice
05-07-2019T16:17:40,IronHorseComics,since when?
05-07-2019T16:17:58,TeapotOfDoom,Can't be more then a few days
05-07-2019T16:18:17,IronHorseComics,doesn't look any different to me
05-07-2019T16:18:25,TeapotOfDoom,Really?
05-07-2019T16:18:46,TeapotOfDoom,i just went to deviantart.com/twokinds and it looked completely different
05-07-2019T16:20:13,TerraTheWizard,it's not new
05-07-2019T16:20:18,TerraTheWizard,it's been a thing for about a year
05-07-2019T16:20:20,TerraTheWizard,togglable
05-07-2019T16:20:28,TerraTheWizard,maybe that was just for people with core
05-07-2019T16:21:10,TerraTheWizard,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/527610623870369793/597175206372573313/unknown.png
05-07-2019T16:21:55,TerraTheWizard,"i don't like it, it's not a great layout and it breaks my plugins"
05-07-2019T16:22:21,TerraTheWizard,the only plus feature it has it darkmode
05-07-2019T16:22:32,IronHorseComics,oh lord
05-07-2019T16:22:40,IronHorseComics,I frgot about the darkmode
05-07-2019T16:22:43,IronHorseComics,*forgot
05-07-2019T16:23:00,IronHorseComics,had a buddy who tried it and he hated it
05-07-2019T16:24:44,TerraTheWizard,it's not even a good darkmode
05-07-2019T16:24:46,TeapotOfDoom,I actually use a plugin that scans the page elements and converts the color scheme to dark mode on everypage
05-07-2019T16:24:47,TerraTheWizard,it's too dark
05-07-2019T16:25:33,TeapotOfDoom,It's very confusing to me to work on someone elses machine because everything looks different
05-07-2019T16:26:48,TeapotOfDoom,"""Join the largest community in the world"" Now that's a bold claim to make"
05-07-2019T16:28:02,TerraTheWizard,reminds me of reddit's tagline
05-07-2019T16:28:07,TerraTheWizard,"""the front page of the internet"""
05-07-2019T16:28:11,IronHorseComics,"it doesn't say ""art community"" anymore?"
05-07-2019T16:28:18,TerraTheWizard,put me off joining for years because i found it pretentious
05-07-2019T16:29:57,Bgrmystr2,I don't have any option for deviantart for dark mode
05-07-2019T16:29:59,Bgrmystr2,never have
05-07-2019T16:31:07,IronHorseComics,"it's a recent premium feature, a bad one"
05-07-2019T16:32:29,TeapotOfDoom,"Okay i read over the ""art"" part"
05-07-2019T16:33:03,TeapotOfDoom,Really? i can turn it on without even being signed in
05-07-2019T16:34:13,IronHorseComics,odd
05-07-2019T16:34:32,TerraTheWizard,i had it load into the new layout once in incog
05-07-2019T16:34:41,TerraTheWizard,choses it randomly
05-07-2019T16:34:49,TerraTheWizard,*seeimingly randomly
05-07-2019T16:34:56,TerraTheWizard,feck
05-07-2019T16:34:59,TerraTheWizard,i can't spell today
05-07-2019T16:39:06,TeapotOfDoom,typos get the best of us sometimes
05-07-2019T16:39:07,IronHorseComics,"again, odd"
05-07-2019T16:39:37,TeapotOfDoom,layouting a board is more complicated then i thought
05-07-2019T16:55:19,Bgrmystr2,"It probably keeps the option because it has the history of you being logged in in the browser, Teapot"
05-07-2019T16:55:23,Bgrmystr2,tis how most sites work
05-07-2019T16:56:48,Bgrmystr2,"as long as they have a history of your system being logged in, they can't check your browser history, but your browser will communicate that. Cookies, too."
05-07-2019T16:57:11,Bgrmystr2,some servers watch IPs and times and such
05-07-2019T16:57:18,Bgrmystr2,though I think that's kinda rare
05-07-2019T17:00:21,TeapotOfDoom,Well I can say for sure that that's not the case
05-07-2019T17:01:20,TeapotOfDoom,I guess the fact that i scroll through on mobile normally makes the difference
05-07-2019T17:03:33,Bgrmystr2,"well if it was public for everyone, I'd have it."
05-07-2019T17:03:38,Bgrmystr2,but I do not
05-07-2019T17:20:38,TeapotOfDoom,strange
05-07-2019T17:20:53,Bgrmystr2,not really strange at all. Tis how everything works. xD
05-07-2019T17:44:04,TeapotOfDoom,Well I'm heading to bed soon
05-07-2019T17:45:12,TeapotOfDoom,Does anyone know if there is a high res version of the full character banner tom uses as footer for the comic page and header of the patreon?
05-07-2019T17:46:38,AspiringNoodle,Good afternoon everyone <3
05-07-2019T17:48:27,TeapotOfDoom,hi noodle

05-07-2019T17:57:09,AspiringNoodle,...no :c
05-07-2019T17:57:13,IronHorseComics,phooey
05-07-2019T17:57:21,AspiringNoodle,It's not the same :ptv-whiny:
05-07-2019T17:58:24,Bgrmystr2,:birthday::tada::balloon::ptv-greetings: Ay I kinda sorta forgot but happy bday man

05-07-2019T18:01:38,Bgrmystr2,:v
05-07-2019T18:01:44,Bgrmystr2,'s good though
05-07-2019T18:02:57,IronHorseComics,EYYYYYYYY
05-07-2019T18:03:06,IronHorseComics,now you're as old as me!
05-07-2019T18:03:57,AspiringNoodle,Except I'm *just* starting art :P
05-07-2019T18:04:28,AspiringNoodle,Doesn't help that I spent most of my leaning life thinking I'd be a game developer
05-07-2019T18:04:38,AspiringNoodle,And then learn what a shitshow that industry is -_-
05-07-2019T18:04:48,TerraTheWizard,oof
05-07-2019T18:05:07,TerraTheWizard,it's all glitz and glamour from the outside
05-07-2019T18:05:17,AspiringNoodle,"Also, can we acknowledge how shitty corporations are as a whole?"
05-07-2019T18:05:38,AspiringNoodle,"I've found my fair share of ""junior"" position applications asking for 2 - 3 years experience"
05-07-2019T18:05:43,TerraTheWizard,"done that, realised there's squat you can reasonably do about it"
05-07-2019T18:05:47,AspiringNoodle,"It's like.... ""BOI."""
05-07-2019T18:06:36,AspiringNoodle,"Though I now have the mentality, if they label it a junior position, I apply and get asked about my work experience, I'll just give it straight (even if it means NOT getting the job)"
05-07-2019T18:07:09,IronHorseComics,"which for most part, it does mean you won't get the job"
05-07-2019T18:07:22,AspiringNoodle,"""My understanding is that this is a JUNIOR position, aka entry.  The amount of experience *required* would make this a mid-level position."""
05-07-2019T18:07:36,AspiringNoodle,"""So is this a JUNIOR or a MID-LEVEL position?"""
05-07-2019T18:07:59,TerraTheWizard,they have 2 reasons
05-07-2019T18:08:02,TeapotOfDoom,Classic. Though not as common over here
05-07-2019T18:08:04,TerraTheWizard,they don't want to pay you well
05-07-2019T18:08:08,AspiringNoodle,^
05-07-2019T18:08:08,IronHorseComics,"oh please that's nothing, want to know what I kept seeing for graphic design positions"
05-07-2019T18:08:10,TerraTheWizard,and they don't want to train you
05-07-2019T18:08:16,IronHorseComics,in my local city
05-07-2019T18:08:21,AspiringNoodle,Basically what every article on the 'net says
05-07-2019T18:08:40,AspiringNoodle,"They're lazy and cheap, don't want to bother investing in new employees who might be bothered to stick around longer because of said training"
05-07-2019T18:08:41,IronHorseComics,they want a bachelors degree AND 5 years experience
05-07-2019T18:08:42,TerraTheWizard,10-15 years we'll have a job crisis
05-07-2019T18:08:46,AspiringNoodle,And they don't want to pay people what they're worth
05-07-2019T18:09:02,AspiringNoodle,I know EXACTLY what the dumbasses are thinking
05-07-2019T18:09:20,TeapotOfDoom,I mean how does that even work?
05-07-2019T18:09:23,AspiringNoodle,"They'll put in the year requirement, and there will be some poor desperate sap whose qualified for a mid-level position"
05-07-2019T18:09:42,TerraTheWizard,"the 50y/o's at the top all retire, the companies either make the role they had redundant or they just don't find anyone meeting their requirements"
05-07-2019T18:09:44,AspiringNoodle,"But because they need a job now, they'll take the junior position (and the accompanying lower pay) just to pay the bills"
05-07-2019T18:10:13,TerraTheWizard,also what i've seen from friends:
05-07-2019T18:10:14,TeapotOfDoom,And tha's just expoitation
05-07-2019T18:10:22,TerraTheWizard,they join a low level job in a company
05-07-2019T18:10:24,AspiringNoodle,I'm gonna enjoy laughing at these industries that start collapsing when they can no longer fill entry-level positions
05-07-2019T18:10:29,AspiringNoodle,"Or mid-level, or senior-level"
05-07-2019T18:10:37,TerraTheWizard,and the 60y/o's that work there bully them out
05-07-2019T18:10:39,AspiringNoodle,Because they're not creating new employees :ptv-unimpressed:
05-07-2019T18:10:47,TerraTheWizard,because they're friends with hr
05-07-2019T18:11:04,TeapotOfDoom,Now that's really just stupid
05-07-2019T18:11:09,AspiringNoodle,"Wow, I'm surprised there aren't MORE mass shootings at companies"
05-07-2019T18:11:17,TeapotOfDoom,How's a company like this supposed to survive
05-07-2019T18:11:25,TerraTheWizard,10-15 years
05-07-2019T18:11:26,IronHorseComics,"easy, they underpay the old people too"
05-07-2019T18:11:28,TerraTheWizard,job crisis
05-07-2019T18:11:41,AspiringNoodle,This is why I *kinda* want to work for myself ._.
05-07-2019T18:11:47,AspiringNoodle,Or at least a tight nit company
05-07-2019T18:12:02,AspiringNoodle,The writing's on the wall
05-07-2019T18:12:05,IronHorseComics,I work for a mom and pop print shop
05-07-2019T18:12:11,TeapotOfDoom,Funny thing over here they're like suckin up every drop of talent they can get
05-07-2019T18:12:12,TerraTheWizard,"anyways, i go bed :ctwokinds-RainezZz:"
05-07-2019T18:12:39,AspiringNoodle,America is a great example of how Capitalism is one of the greatest things to happen to the world
05-07-2019T18:12:46,TeapotOfDoom,"Me too. I have to get up ""early"" tomorrow"
05-07-2019T18:12:51,AspiringNoodle,But it's also a great example of how it can go horribly wrong when left unchecked
05-07-2019T18:13:16,IronHorseComics,"Europe is a better example of the latter, monopolies are still legal over there, they're just voernment run"
05-07-2019T18:13:25,IronHorseComics,*government
05-07-2019T18:13:41,AspiringNoodle,"We do *allow* monopolies, but they must be for essential services"
05-07-2019T18:13:47,TeapotOfDoom,Well it's mostly in fields nobody wants to do anyway
05-07-2019T18:14:08,AspiringNoodle,"It's a lot easier to have infrastructure set up and then 1 company for, say, power."
05-07-2019T18:14:47,TeapotOfDoom,Also government monopolies are not as common as you would think
05-07-2019T18:15:00,TeapotOfDoom,Anyway I'm heading to bed too
05-07-2019T18:15:06,TeapotOfDoom,Night guys
05-07-2019T18:15:09,IronHorseComics,well most of Europe's railroads are
05-07-2019T18:15:29,AspiringNoodle,*going through youtube videos*
05-07-2019T18:15:31,TeapotOfDoom,Deutsche Bahn is not (and is late like all the time it seems)
05-07-2019T18:15:38,AspiringNoodle,*sees videos on yesterday's cali earthquake*
05-07-2019T18:15:50,AspiringNoodle,"""Eeeeeeey, I was in Chu's stream when they felt it"""
05-07-2019T18:16:06,IronHorseComics,I felt nothing
05-07-2019T18:16:22,IronHorseComics,I live on the correct side of the US ;)
05-07-2019T18:17:14,AspiringNoodle,"East coast represent, mofos >:3"
05-07-2019T18:17:32,IronHorseComics,precisely
05-07-2019T18:17:52,AspiringNoodle,"When hollywood eventually leaves cali, I'm like, for the love of god, move over here!!!"
05-07-2019T18:18:35,IronHorseComics,"and I'll be like ""For the love of god STAY AWAY from here, we don't want your stupidity here!"""
05-07-2019T18:19:08,AspiringNoodle,"Meh, there's not really any gated communities here ;)"
05-07-2019T18:19:26,AspiringNoodle,They'll have to expose themselves to *gasps in disbelief* OPPOSING OPINIONS!
05-07-2019T18:20:00,IronHorseComics,"No, NOOOO!"
05-07-2019T18:21:16,AspiringNoodle,"It might also be an eye opener for them in this regard: Nobody gives two sh*ts about what they think, politically ;)"
05-07-2019T18:21:52,AspiringNoodle,"We pay them for entertainment, not their pie-in-the-sky, pipe-dream ivory tower grandstanding"
05-07-2019T18:22:00,IronHorseComics,"if anything, they'll go against them just to spite them"
05-07-2019T18:22:04,AspiringNoodle,*phew* that was a mouthful!
05-07-2019T18:23:02,AspiringNoodle,*looks at gift cards*
05-07-2019T18:23:06,AspiringNoodle,*looks at steam prices*
05-07-2019T18:23:10,AspiringNoodle,*sweating intensifies*
05-07-2019T18:24:04,IronHorseComics,"oh yeah, did you guys enjoy the stream last night? it's been a while since I've had a decent audience and even then I was multistreaming with a bigger artist"
05-07-2019T18:24:20,AspiringNoodle,You multistreamed?
05-07-2019T18:24:29,AspiringNoodle,I never refreshed xD
05-07-2019T18:24:33,IronHorseComics,no
05-07-2019T18:24:55,AspiringNoodle,"Best part was the ""kill it with fire"" eyes :P"
05-07-2019T18:24:56,IronHorseComics,the multistreaming was a long while ago
05-07-2019T18:25:31,IronHorseComics,"still hadn't fixed that yet, but that's because I'm working on lineart atm for the regular page"
05-07-2019T18:26:37,AspiringNoodle,"I just want a computer that can use my monitor at its native resolution, and doesn't take forever to wake up / render images xD"
05-07-2019T18:27:15,IronHorseComics,"step one, make sure you have a power source that can handle any significant upgrades"
05-07-2019T18:27:28,AspiringNoodle,I think my power supply is the problem :P
05-07-2019T18:27:35,AspiringNoodle,I'll be able to figure that out once I build the new system
05-07-2019T18:28:30,IronHorseComics,"no seriously, you'll need a power supply with enough wattage to handle everything"
05-07-2019T18:29:26,Bgrmystr2,"Just FYI, power companies having a monopoly is a bad thing"
05-07-2019T18:29:27,Bgrmystr2,not a good thing
05-07-2019T18:29:46,Bgrmystr2,"it's decent that everyone gets power, but they overcharge you out of the ass for it and noone keeps them in check"
05-07-2019T18:29:59,AspiringNoodle,No to sure about that
05-07-2019T18:30:02,Bgrmystr2,"and anytime you want to go off the grid with your own power solution, they attack you or try to make it illegal"
05-07-2019T18:30:12,Bgrmystr2,Ask the florida woman who tried to go off the grid for power
05-07-2019T18:30:28,AspiringNoodle,US rates are anywhere from 7c to 20c per kWh
05-07-2019T18:30:28,Bgrmystr2,and the company tried to say it's illegal for her to do that and that she HAD to pay them money for power.
05-07-2019T18:30:42,Bgrmystr2,our bill is $300 a month lol
05-07-2019T18:31:10,Bgrmystr2,that's almost extortion level of money for the amount of power we get
05-07-2019T18:31:23,AspiringNoodle,The states with large levels of renewable energy tend to be cheapest
05-07-2019T18:31:44,AspiringNoodle,The one state with 7c per kWh is mostly hydroelectric
05-07-2019T18:32:09,AspiringNoodle,"Man, the weather really wants me to have a nice birthday"
05-07-2019T18:32:19,AspiringNoodle,"thunderstorms, heavy rain, lightning occasionally"
05-07-2019T18:32:22,AspiringNoodle,I'm lovin it~

05-07-2019T18:32:52,Bgrmystr2,flash flood warnings all day every day
05-07-2019T18:33:15,AspiringNoodle,Funny you would say that
05-07-2019T18:33:27,AspiringNoodle,Got a flash flood warning on my phone about an hour ago ;)
05-07-2019T18:33:55,AspiringNoodle,"I'll brb, time to get food"
05-07-2019T18:34:08,AspiringNoodle,"I only had fried chicken twice, and I'm already sick of it :ptv-unimpressed:"
05-07-2019T18:34:18,AspiringNoodle,And we still have 5 freaking gallon bags of it left
05-07-2019T18:34:26,Bgrmystr2,when you live in an area that's like.. 1 foot underground is the water table.. and some places with the ground UNDER the water table
05-07-2019T18:34:30,Bgrmystr2,flooding is a major problem here
05-07-2019T18:34:49,Bgrmystr2,"so it may not be a big deal for you, but here it can destroy shit and stay for weeks, months even."
05-07-2019T18:35:08,Bgrmystr2,"because water doesn't go below the water table, it has to be pumped out manually."
05-07-2019T18:35:16,IronHorseComics,floods in my town drain fairly quickly
05-07-2019T18:35:24,AspiringNoodle,"Years ago, a small commercial district was completely flooded"
05-07-2019T18:35:35,Bgrmystr2,"wish it were the case here, Iron"
05-07-2019T18:35:44,AspiringNoodle,"The area was like a bowl, and we got a freak amount of rain"
05-07-2019T18:35:49,Bgrmystr2,but we decided some hundred thousand years back to build a city in a big bowl :U
05-07-2019T18:36:19,AspiringNoodle,"The amount of rain was completely unusual, and that was the first time (in my lifetime) that it had ever flooded"
05-07-2019T18:36:30,AspiringNoodle,Entire area was under like 10 feet of water
05-07-2019T18:36:59,Bgrmystr2,where were you at at the time lol
05-07-2019T18:37:08,AspiringNoodle,Wait... it had to be more
05-07-2019T18:37:16,AspiringNoodle,Most of the restaurants were flooded up to the roofs
05-07-2019T18:37:33,AspiringNoodle,In another area :P
05-07-2019T18:38:02,Bgrmystr2,It honestly sounds like you're talking about the flood of Hurricane Katrina back in 05
05-07-2019T18:38:03,Bgrmystr2,:P
05-07-2019T18:38:54,Bgrmystr2,cuz that's just about what it is here.
05-07-2019T18:39:12,Bgrmystr2,Orleans is not a high terrain height city.
05-07-2019T18:49:07,IronHorseComics,oh hey Noodle

05-07-2019T21:16:18,AspiringNoodle,"Alriiiiiight, let's hope I can get to bed in ~3 hours >:3"
05-07-2019T22:19:11,AspiringNoodle,"Lol, I feel like I'll check Newegg/Amazon at midnight, see if they have any postings for X570 / Zen 2 / Navi, and if I see none, complain to them. xD"
05-07-2019T22:19:32,AspiringNoodle,"""What gives???  This stuff's supposed to be launching today!"""
05-07-2019T23:08:09,AspiringNoodle,...can confirm: Pink Lady > Honeycrisp

05-07-2019T23:09:01,AspiringNoodle,NEIN
05-07-2019T23:09:17,AspiringNoodle,"Sorry, I just prefer the original animated films :P"
05-07-2019T23:09:42,AspiringNoodle,"I saw the new live-action jungle book, and it was good.  But I feel like what Disney's doing is rather creatively bankrupt"
05-07-2019T23:10:03,Sclimshady,"Need new disney movies, not remakes"
05-07-2019T23:10:06,AspiringNoodle,"Don't need that spreading around and 2019 / 2020 / 2021 being known for ""live action remakes of classic animated films"""
05-07-2019T23:10:26,AspiringNoodle,"Oh yeah, also saw Beauty and the Beast, too"
05-07-2019T23:10:49,AspiringNoodle,"Liked it, but again, literally just take the original plot / cinematography / songs, slap some live-action makeovers on top, call it a day :/"
05-07-2019T23:14:03,AspiringNoodle,"Awwww, birthday over"
05-07-2019T23:14:08,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-whiny:

05-07-2019T23:41:12,Sclimshady,Have you never seen alice in wonderland?
05-07-2019T23:41:59,AspiringNoodle,"Yes, but it's been probably over a decade"
