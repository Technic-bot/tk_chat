15-06-2019T01:18:26,SpazztasticKiwi,hopefully you can keep to keto
15-06-2019T01:36:32,Twokinds,I'm thinking of taking a break from keto once it's con time
15-06-2019T01:37:00,Twokinds,I've hit my goal weight. I'll still avoid sugar but I'm not going to be so extreme on the no-bread thing.
15-06-2019T02:02:50,SpazztasticKiwi,actually taking a break and then going back once home or break to stop
15-06-2019T02:03:05,SpazztasticKiwi,& üéâ

15-06-2019T02:21:38,Twokinds,Depends on how much weight I gain back XD

15-06-2019T11:07:00,Orthonox,How is everyone's weekend so far?
15-06-2019T11:11:00,RimaDraws,Been good. Drawing like crazy which I hardly do on the weekends
15-06-2019T11:20:44,Orthonox,That's productive! My saturday was anything but. Hope to remedy that for today.
15-06-2019T11:27:55,RimaDraws,My cbd oil has helped me actually be more productive and sleep better without my anxiety hitting me
15-06-2019T11:47:59,Orthonox,That's good to hear. Bummer that you have anxiety.
15-06-2019T12:29:58,RimaDraws,Yea with anxiety comes depression so it‚Äôs controlled that too

15-06-2019T14:06:04,RimaDraws,hi tom
15-06-2019T14:07:16,metalman20,how's everyone doing today?
15-06-2019T14:09:58,RimaDraws,i am alright. just drawing some today
15-06-2019T14:10:33,IronHorseComics,working on last week's comic update
15-06-2019T14:11:39,TeapotOfDoom,@iliar Has there been a new one?
15-06-2019T14:12:23,TeapotOfDoom,Still have to study for a bit but then I'm free for the night
15-06-2019T14:15:01,iliar,Today I saw a theory: Nibs is Nora.
15-06-2019T14:15:05,metalman20,nice. any fun plans for tonight teapot?
15-06-2019T14:16:58,RimaDraws,ive had a theory that nibs was a dragon for a while
15-06-2019T14:17:43,IronHorseComics,but why would she be afraid of Reni if she were a dragon?
15-06-2019T14:18:01,iliar,I think it was an April Fool's joke.
15-06-2019T14:19:22,RimaDraws,i dont remember it being an april fools joke thats just my own theory
15-06-2019T14:19:50,Orthonox,I'm beting Nibs is just an abnormal squirrel used for comic relief and to mess with the audience on her significance to the plot.
15-06-2019T14:19:52,WereKeidran,well Raine did say that young dragons shapeshift to see the world
15-06-2019T14:20:15,WereKeidran,Nibs might be related to Reni and is out without permission
15-06-2019T14:20:43,RimaDraws,probably
15-06-2019T14:20:48,metalman20,that would make sense
15-06-2019T14:21:00,IronHorseComics,but wouldn't Reni detect her with telepathy?
15-06-2019T14:22:59,Twokinds,Apparently people really like cats recently.
15-06-2019T14:23:30,IronHorseComics,that's nothing new bro
15-06-2019T14:23:37,SpazztasticKiwi,üêà
15-06-2019T14:24:22,iliar,@Twokinds Do you mean voting results?
15-06-2019T14:26:20,TeapotOfDoom,Well stream obviously. Messing with music atm though
15-06-2019T14:26:38,RimaDraws,yea has to do with nora being a feline probably
15-06-2019T14:26:53,metalman20,well nora does make a good feline
15-06-2019T14:27:56,IronHorseComics,so does Maren
15-06-2019T14:28:12,IronHorseComics,I still think her headbutting Scythe would be funny
15-06-2019T14:28:32,metalman20,what kind of music do you like teapot?
15-06-2019T14:28:39,TeapotOfDoom,Bigroom
15-06-2019T14:28:49,TeapotOfDoom,cause it never dies
15-06-2019T14:30:47,metalman20,awesome
15-06-2019T14:31:08,iliar,"I have conflicting feelings about this Nora's form. This form looks good. And as Nora's fan, I like it when it appears on art."
15-06-2019T14:31:10,iliar,But I prefer the human. And it would be interesting for me to look at the anthro form.
15-06-2019T14:31:27,TeapotOfDoom,It's a subgenre of electro house. Party all over
15-06-2019T14:32:42,Twokinds,Smallroom
15-06-2019T14:33:14,TeapotOfDoom,What if you remove the walls completely?
15-06-2019T14:33:32,metalman20,noroom
15-06-2019T14:34:21,IronHorseComics,"we call that ""Crushed by roof"""
15-06-2019T14:34:34,IronHorseComics,"because if you remove the walls, the roof will fall"
15-06-2019T14:35:56,TeapotOfDoom,Then the house part is gone too
15-06-2019T14:36:10,TeapotOfDoom,"If the roof falls hard, is that considered hardstyle?"
15-06-2019T14:38:13,RimaDraws,well someone just got pulled over
15-06-2019T14:40:39,metalman20,"uh oh, that doesn't sound good"
15-06-2019T14:40:46,IronHorseComics,"that guy is currently dealing with ""Copstyle"""
15-06-2019T14:41:06,RimaDraws,yea sitting in my apartment this guy comes out of the parking lot i can hear it and i heard a police siren just now
15-06-2019T14:41:12,RimaDraws,also there could be an accident somewhere
15-06-2019T14:41:34,IronHorseComics,he probably wrecked his car like an idiot and the cop just showed up
15-06-2019T14:42:15,RimaDraws,probably. i live down the road from the police station
15-06-2019T14:42:41,IronHorseComics,"heh, bet that's a pretty good crook repellent"
15-06-2019T14:42:58,TeapotOfDoom,Lvl 1 crook?
15-06-2019T14:43:30,IronHorseComics,"""I LIVE NEXT DOOR TO A BUNCH OF COPS!"" ""Aw s*** she does, NEXT Apartment!"""
15-06-2019T14:44:14,WereKeidran,i did have a cop live next door to me at one point at my old place

15-06-2019T15:18:07,Twokinds,"Nibbly, Cat Nora"
15-06-2019T15:18:11,PalmettoPathfinder1,This reminds me of my suggestion a couple years back where Keith woke up in bed with both Adelaide and Natani.
15-06-2019T15:18:17,Bgrmystr2,"Floofy, you need to have been watching the votes for the past several years xD"

15-06-2019T17:52:34,IronHorseComics,"though for a brief period of time I didn't shower often, but that's because I was an Amazon employee with blisters for days on my feet that wouldn't go away and I didn't want to lose the blister bandaids that I had to cover them with"

15-06-2019T18:20:39,Ordithus,bgr with the logic
15-06-2019T18:20:40,MarvTheHugPharaoh,you want to show some personality in a ref sheet.
15-06-2019T18:20:55,Dadrobit,"I don't mind her being nude, I just think the serving platter should probably be with a full outfit and let the nude part be just that."

15-06-2019T18:21:26,LannAF,Actually ref sheets are very often laden with personality  quips and examples of them in situations where it arises

15-06-2019T18:21:40,MarvTheHugPharaoh,^

15-06-2019T20:31:44,FloofyCat,"Well, we've been joking about how out of control the ref sheets can be for a while now (Ref sheet ref sheet, potato sack and all)"
15-06-2019T20:31:47,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-power:
15-06-2019T20:32:06,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Well, yeah they were starting to get out of hand."
15-06-2019T20:32:27,Dadrobit,"Nah, he's put his foot down before. Hence why we don't have Alaric giving Keith a foot massage in full winter gear."
15-06-2019T20:32:47,FenceEqualizer,That was a thing?
15-06-2019T20:32:56,PalmettoPathfinder1,But at least no fem Keith or man Nat refs.  :P I must have missed that stream where he did that.
15-06-2019T20:32:58,FenceEqualizer,Oh wait nm
15-06-2019T20:32:59,RimaDraws,lol
15-06-2019T20:33:14,IronHorseComics,"wait, was that a thing>"
15-06-2019T20:33:15,RimaDraws,he only did regular keith and natani ref sheets
15-06-2019T20:33:21,Dadrobit,"lol, I tried at least."
15-06-2019T20:33:28,Dadrobit,I got the foot.
15-06-2019T20:33:47,RimaDraws,i want a clovis ref sheet
15-06-2019T20:33:52,FenceEqualizer,I remember that.
15-06-2019T20:34:27,swack24,I think its alrady made
15-06-2019T20:34:37,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Although if someone did suggest a fem Keith ref sheet, you can bet that a lot of people would vote it. Thankfully we won't have that. :D"
15-06-2019T20:34:39,RimaDraws,no its not
15-06-2019T20:34:43,IronHorseComics,I actually would like a regular Trace sheet
15-06-2019T20:34:55,RimaDraws,i would like a trace ref too
15-06-2019T20:34:59,IronHorseComics,mainly to figure out how tall he is
15-06-2019T20:35:00,RimaDraws,we need one to go with flora
15-06-2019T20:35:05,RimaDraws,hes 5'6
15-06-2019T20:35:16,RimaDraws,i think
15-06-2019T20:35:19,IronHorseComics,that's what the tiger Trace one says right?
15-06-2019T20:35:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,we got a trace ref
15-06-2019T20:35:25,FloofyCat,"Same, although I'd like it later, unless Tom prefers the ref sheets to be over and done with ASAP."
15-06-2019T20:35:25,FenceEqualizer,"Same,  going to keep voting for it."
15-06-2019T20:35:36,FenceEqualizer,Tiger trace doesn't count
15-06-2019T20:35:37,Ordithus,"tiger trace is 5'9"""
15-06-2019T20:35:41,RimaDraws,no hes 5'9

15-06-2019T20:35:51,PalmettoPathfinder1,Same here.  I would like to see a ref sheet of Trace.  :) And an Iris and Sythe refs too.  :)
15-06-2019T20:35:57,RimaDraws,trace is actually 5'9''
15-06-2019T20:36:05,Dadrobit,Shot boy is short
15-06-2019T20:36:09,Dadrobit,short*
15-06-2019T20:36:13,Dadrobit,I don't think he
15-06-2019T20:36:15,Dadrobit,is shot
15-06-2019T20:36:19,Dadrobit,unlike my spelling
15-06-2019T20:36:19,IronHorseComics,he's only an inch shorter than I am
15-06-2019T20:36:20,RimaDraws,hes an inch taller than me
15-06-2019T20:36:21,FloofyCat,Why do people like ref sheets anyway?
15-06-2019T20:36:28,FloofyCat,Is it for the actual references or for the stat blocks?
15-06-2019T20:36:33,RimaDraws,i use them for references
15-06-2019T20:36:35,FenceEqualizer,Both
15-06-2019T20:36:37,Dadrobit,"Because Floofy, people have no standards of #Quality"
15-06-2019T20:36:42,IronHorseComics,because if they wanted to do fanart they'd be precise with the scaling
15-06-2019T20:36:49,unsteddyphoenix,I do like stat blocks
15-06-2019T20:37:13,RimaDraws,ive been using the ones we have already to draw the girls

15-06-2019T20:37:15,MarvTheHugPharaoh,One of these days roller coaster will come.  I know it will
15-06-2019T20:37:21,unsteddyphoenix,But some people go for like. extremely minor characters instead of important characters
15-06-2019T20:37:25,FloofyCat,I can see people like Rima and other artists liking it but I'm pretty interested in the stats. I'd be interested in the references more if I could draw.
15-06-2019T20:37:26,unsteddyphoenix,Which is kinda annoying
15-06-2019T20:37:35,RimaDraws,floofy you a bit late
15-06-2019T20:37:43,FloofyCat,"Yeah, same thoughts here Teddy."
15-06-2019T20:37:48,RimaDraws,you should see the arts ive done this weekend because of those
15-06-2019T20:37:48,FloofyCat,"Huh, Rima?"

15-06-2019T20:37:59,IronHorseComics,can I see?
15-06-2019T20:38:04,RimaDraws,"i already did kat, flora, and nat"
15-06-2019T20:38:10,RimaDraws,but ill whisper so not to disturb
15-06-2019T20:38:13,Dadrobit,"Hey, to be fair, Cathleen and Cornelius meeting turned out pretty fantastic."

15-06-2019T20:38:44,Dadrobit,That was literally one of the first.
15-06-2019T20:38:49,PalmettoPathfinder1,I like them for the lore and ref.
15-06-2019T20:38:52,FloofyCat,Updating the text of the characters page could be a workaround for limiting ref sheet suggestions Tom
15-06-2019T20:39:10,IronHorseComics,"give her time, she's got several people she's gotta whisper all of it too"
15-06-2019T20:39:12,PalmettoPathfinder1,Hm...Floofy you might be on to something.
15-06-2019T20:39:19,FenceEqualizer,"Ehh, references will stop in time"

15-06-2019T20:58:03,TheAngelAquila,This holding hands stuff is too lewd for me
15-06-2019T20:58:04,PalmettoPathfinder1,I think this should have been full body in order to make it even more lewd. ;P

15-06-2019T20:58:36,IronHorseComics,we have boob squishing
15-06-2019T20:58:40,Bgrmystr2,We do.
15-06-2019T20:58:42,PalmettoPathfinder1,Full Body = More Lewdness
15-06-2019T20:58:51,PalmettoPathfinder1,It's basic math people!
15-06-2019T20:59:38,PalmettoPathfinder1,And they said you wouldn't use math in the real world.  :P
15-06-2019T20:59:48,FenceEqualizer,Where can one learn the art of double entendres like Robit?
15-06-2019T20:59:50,RimaDraws,wow got slow real quick here
15-06-2019T20:59:51,ZoopBoopLoop,Yaaaaaaay Clovis getting in touch with her Foxy side!
15-06-2019T21:00:07,TheAngelAquila,"Eric: Okay ladies, now hold that pose for about an hour."
15-06-2019T21:00:09,unsteddyphoenix,Boob squish happened
15-06-2019T21:00:25,RimaDraws,an hour later someone starts bewb grabbing
15-06-2019T21:00:43,TheAngelAquila,More like Nora's hand wanders to Clove's rump
15-06-2019T21:00:44,Dadrobit,"Have a supremely fucked up family Fence, that's how."
15-06-2019T21:00:50,FenceEqualizer,#Unkinkthefox
15-06-2019T21:00:54,MarvTheHugPharaoh,50/50 chance nora or clovis starts the grab session
15-06-2019T21:00:56,FenceEqualizer,Well then
15-06-2019T21:00:59,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Hm...Since fem Clovis is canon, would it have to be a separate ref sheet or would fem Clovis be included in male Clovis ref sheet?"
15-06-2019T21:01:05,RimaDraws,i think nora will
15-06-2019T21:01:08,RimaDraws,my bets are on her
15-06-2019T21:01:08,TheAngelAquila,Who knows!
15-06-2019T21:01:36,TheAngelAquila,"I mean, Natani got a sheet right? I don't think there was Young Natani in that sheet."
15-06-2019T21:01:45,RimaDraws,no there wasnt
15-06-2019T21:01:50,TheAngelAquila,So maleClovis would probably be a seperate sheet.
15-06-2019T21:01:59,FenceEqualizer,Are you trying to find loop holes for references?
15-06-2019T21:02:00,PalmettoPathfinder1,Tom we need your ruling?  This would make it easier for people to suggest Clovis ref sheet in the future.
15-06-2019T21:02:02,TheAngelAquila,In theory
15-06-2019T21:02:11,FloofyCat,Male/Female Clovis would be the same.
15-06-2019T21:02:17,PalmettoPathfinder1,No.  Trying to keep my brain from hurting itself.
15-06-2019T21:02:27,FloofyCat,If side comics counted as main story that is.
15-06-2019T21:02:28,RimaDraws,yea it would technically
15-06-2019T21:02:34,RimaDraws,just diff
15-06-2019T21:02:35,CrRAR,Clovis current state with bindings or whatever
15-06-2019T21:02:38,RimaDraws,parts...
15-06-2019T21:02:39,unsteddyphoenix,"Man, dont request Clovis"
15-06-2019T21:02:49,TheAngelAquila,Always request Clovis
15-06-2019T21:02:50,unsteddyphoenix,For a ref sheet
15-06-2019T21:02:56,FloofyCat,Get the main characters for ref sheets first.
15-06-2019T21:02:58,RimaDraws,i will do it steddy
15-06-2019T21:03:04,FloofyCat,Then Tom can update the character page on the website
15-06-2019T21:03:11,FenceEqualizer,"Plot twist, Nora is only holding onto Clovis for support since she can't walk on two legs"
15-06-2019T21:03:21,CrRAR,haha
15-06-2019T21:03:23,FloofyCat,And it won't be everyone with fresh new pics except one or two people.
15-06-2019T21:03:24,unsteddyphoenix,"lol, probably accurate"
15-06-2019T21:03:27,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Okay, unsteddy you caught my curiosity: why no Clovis ref sheet?"
15-06-2019T21:03:29,TheAngelAquila,That's probably partially what's happening
15-06-2019T21:03:31,RimaDraws,shes grabbing her butt to hold up
15-06-2019T21:03:54,unsteddyphoenix,Because he's an extremely minor character...for now.
15-06-2019T21:04:02,unsteddyphoenix,Ref sheets should be about main characters
15-06-2019T21:04:06,TheAngelAquila,"Nora: Two legs takes some getting used to. You don't mind if I use you for support, do you? **squishes against Clovis**"
15-06-2019T21:04:12,RimaDraws,clovis may be about as main as a villain for now
15-06-2019T21:04:26,RimaDraws,he is like .....side boss
15-06-2019T21:04:31,TheAngelAquila,Clovis seems to be a secondary antagonist
15-06-2019T21:04:32,FenceEqualizer,Ehh he hasn't had much story time
15-06-2019T21:04:45,RimaDraws,thats why i said side boss
15-06-2019T21:04:47,TheAngelAquila,And is kinda more of a prominent figure than the other Templars.
15-06-2019T21:04:49,FenceEqualizer,I can see why Unsteddy would want to wait
15-06-2019T21:04:50,RimaDraws,not major boss
15-06-2019T21:04:50,TheAngelAquila,Or at least a hotter figure
15-06-2019T21:05:12,Dadrobit,"Yeah, Adira only has a dozen-ish pages she's on, but even that blows Clovis out of the water."
15-06-2019T21:05:15,TheAngelAquila,Clovis: The face of evil you can get behind.
15-06-2019T21:05:16,unsteddyphoenix,We've seen his sillouette once in the main story
15-06-2019T21:05:22,unsteddyphoenix,~maybe~
15-06-2019T21:05:34,RimaDraws,he is in chapter 18 at the end
15-06-2019T21:05:38,FenceEqualizer,His evillll silhouette
15-06-2019T21:05:43,CrRAR,Clovis: main villian wannabe
15-06-2019T21:05:45,Ordithus,We see his muzzle too
15-06-2019T21:05:47,unsteddyphoenix,It was extremely evil
15-06-2019T21:05:49,ColonelFox,clovis seems confused on how he got into this position
15-06-2019T21:05:50,TraceLegacyXI,Howdy people!

15-06-2019T21:06:14,TheAngelAquila,Also Clovis is much more ripe for situational comedy like this

15-06-2019T21:06:48,FloofyCat,To be honest I've always wondered about a Na'Rella reference sheet but more of a plan but that's probably a lot of work.

15-06-2019T21:57:31,Bgrmystr2,"but dadro, according to kiwi, that'sw eird."

15-06-2019T21:59:32,SpazztasticKiwi,And I mixed in some sprints
15-06-2019T22:00:04,SpazztasticKiwi,we‚Äôll see in the morning if my thighs complain about that though
15-06-2019T22:00:33,Dadrobit,:( Now I'm sad. I miss having a workout girlfriend.
15-06-2019T22:00:53,SpazztasticKiwi,we can all work out with each other in spirit
15-06-2019T22:01:10,Dadrobit,Showering with each other in spirit just isn't the same. Trust me.

15-06-2019T22:03:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I considered swimming but our pool is part of the gym thing at the rec center and indoors
15-06-2019T22:03:20,Dadrobit,Racist pricks.
15-06-2019T22:03:34,SpazztasticKiwi,how charming
15-06-2019T22:03:46,Dadrobit,Indeed
15-06-2019T22:04:03,SpazztasticKiwi,I work with a lady that‚Äôs...selective of her company
15-06-2019T22:04:32,SpazztasticKiwi,the work gossip. There‚Äôs a reason I wear my headphones all the time
15-06-2019T22:04:44,SpazztasticKiwi,it annoys the piss out of her
15-06-2019T22:16:49,RimaDraws,i just keep to my group of four ladies i hang with

15-06-2019T22:27:14,RimaDraws,night ord
15-06-2019T22:28:10,Dadrobit,o/
15-06-2019T22:28:54,AspiringNoodle,"Oh man... watching a video, noticed a game called Ori and the Blind Forest.  Checked it out on steam.  Not only is it 4 years old, but it looks beautiful."
15-06-2019T22:29:10,AspiringNoodle,Aaaaaaaaaaand the trailer managed to inspire me and make me cry at the same time.
15-06-2019T22:30:01,RimaDraws,oooh
15-06-2019T22:30:53,unsteddyphoenix,that game is extremely good so I hear
15-06-2019T22:30:56,unsteddyphoenix,Still need to play it
15-06-2019T22:30:56,AspiringNoodle,"The forest of Nibel is dying. After a powerful storm sets a series of devastating events in motion, an unlikely hero must journey to find his courage and confront a dark nemesis to save his home."
15-06-2019T22:31:08,AspiringNoodle,"‚ÄúOri and the Blind Forest‚Äù tells the tale of a young orphan destined for heroics, through a visually stunning action-platformer crafted by Moon Studios for PC."
15-06-2019T22:31:17,AspiringNoodle,"Featuring hand-painted artwork, meticulously animated character performance, and a fully orchestrated score, ‚ÄúOri and the Blind Forest‚Äù explores a deeply emotional story about love and sacrifice, and the hope that exists in us all."
15-06-2019T22:32:00,AspiringNoodle,This is why I wish I didn't get sucked into WoW for so many years.  Missing little gems like this.
15-06-2019T22:33:36,AspiringNoodle,"Sadly, my computer cannot handle even that game :("
15-06-2019T22:34:52,AspiringNoodle,Watch the trailers if you haven't.  The steam reviews say more than enough.
15-06-2019T22:35:00,RimaDraws,oh yea it does
15-06-2019T22:39:47,AspiringNoodle,"Uuuuuuh, buy it and play it"
15-06-2019T22:39:54,AspiringNoodle,They're releasing a new Ori game next year
15-06-2019T22:42:57,AspiringNoodle,"Man, it's crazy how much iGPUs have improved..."
15-06-2019T22:46:33,AspiringNoodle,"So, the Vega 8 iGPU that comes with the Ryzen 2200g ($84 quad-core) is equivalent to a GTX 550ti"
15-06-2019T22:47:39,AspiringNoodle,And the VEga 11 iGPU that comes with the 2400g ($140 quad-core with SMT) is equivalent to a GTX 750
15-06-2019T22:47:51,AspiringNoodle,Talk about serious improvements
15-06-2019T22:49:25,Dadrobit,"I mean, yeah, they've gotten better over the years, but outside of esports titles and games that are long since considered outdated, they're not pumping out 1440p at 60+ fps."
15-06-2019T22:49:51,AspiringNoodle,But they are getting closer and closer to being 1080p60 capable at max settings
15-06-2019T22:53:39,AspiringNoodle,"Oof, looks like the Vega 11 iGPU you get with the 2400g is basically 2x as power as anything Intel can offer."
15-06-2019T22:54:16,Dadrobit,Try 720. 1080p 60fps is relegated to small indie games and esports. Anything like Assassin's Creed and/or Battlefield and you're looking at dropping those settings way down.
15-06-2019T22:54:52,AspiringNoodle,"So, Vega 11 vs Iris Plus 650 (655 isn't out yet?) vs UDH 630"
15-06-2019T22:55:28,AspiringNoodle,Vega is 74% more powerful
15-06-2019T22:55:41,AspiringNoodle,against the 650*
15-06-2019T22:55:52,AspiringNoodle,Vega is 129% more powerful than the UHD 630
15-06-2019T22:56:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"out of morbid curiosity, how so do you say that ex‚Äôs parents were racist"
15-06-2019T22:56:56,SpazztasticKiwi,cause my co worker is subtle yet not with her ways - many ways to be a üóë
15-06-2019T22:57:30,Dadrobit,"Because they were openly racist? I don't think her mother ever called me by my name? I was at best ""gringo"" but that was usually also said with ""un jodido"""
15-06-2019T22:58:05,Dadrobit,"No English was allowed in their house, and the father was the one who made her break up with me."
15-06-2019T22:58:16,AspiringNoodle,And where was this?
15-06-2019T22:58:23,SpazztasticKiwi,ah the father
15-06-2019T22:58:27,Dadrobit,As in state? Arizona.
15-06-2019T22:58:28,SpazztasticKiwi,sorry to pry
15-06-2019T22:58:35,AspiringNoodle,"Because, the literal eff"
15-06-2019T22:59:07,AspiringNoodle,That screams to me they don't care for America
15-06-2019T22:59:53,SpazztasticKiwi,"my dad, as far as I learned, would‚Äôve been happy with no man for me or my sister"
15-06-2019T23:00:01,Dadrobit,"The girlfriend was an ""anchor baby"". They both came over while the mother was preggo. GF was born and the mother was allowed to stay while the father was deported. Father snuck back in and the first and last time I met him was him with a shotgun."
15-06-2019T23:00:03,AspiringNoodle,It's like... why move somewhere if you're gonna have open disdain for the locals?
15-06-2019T23:00:25,AspiringNoodle,"...yeah, I don't care for *those* immigrants -_-"
15-06-2019T23:00:27,SpazztasticKiwi,"he wanted us to know 3 men only, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit"
15-06-2019T23:00:36,Dadrobit,Told me to fuck off and not come back or else the police wouldn't be able to find all of me.
15-06-2019T23:01:25,Dadrobit,"GF called me later and told me that her parents were making her choose between them and me, and she couldn't leave them. So RIP my relationship."
15-06-2019T23:01:34,SpazztasticKiwi,aw
15-06-2019T23:01:41,AspiringNoodle,Well... she made her decision
15-06-2019T23:01:46,SpazztasticKiwi,sorry dude

15-06-2019T23:02:32,SpazztasticKiwi,and she wasn‚Äôt quiet about it. We were about 4ish years in
15-06-2019T23:04:22,AspiringNoodle,I have a very strong feeling that the reason her parents were so hostile is that they didn't want to risk deportation.
15-06-2019T23:04:59,AspiringNoodle,"And from the sounds of the father... he deserves it, and anything that results."
15-06-2019T23:05:20,Dadrobit,"Ever played Skyrim? Remember ""Skyrim is for the Nords!""? They were like that, except ""Arizona is for Mexico!"""
15-06-2019T23:05:35,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs a bit iffy around here sometimes. You got the speak English only people but it‚Äôs generally nice (though I‚Äôll say I‚Äôm not in any way able to actually judge as I‚Äôm white as paper)

15-06-2019T23:05:53,AspiringNoodle,She's enabling their criminal behavior
15-06-2019T23:05:56,Dadrobit,They were suuuuper patriotic towards Mexico and very firmly believed Arizona belonged to Mexico.
15-06-2019T23:06:02,Bgrmystr2,"exactly, noodle"
15-06-2019T23:06:09,AspiringNoodle,And those are the people who DESERVE deportation

15-06-2019T23:08:42,AspiringNoodle,"Well, your story sounds like the classic tale demonstrating the need for immigration reform."
15-06-2019T23:08:55,Bgrmystr2,"Honestly, no offense to you or her, but if she picked her family over you, I'd say dodged a bullet."

15-06-2019T23:55:28,Bgrmystr2,"if you get both on sale, you can compare each one and find out different setups you may like more"
15-06-2019T23:55:50,Bgrmystr2,I think it's like $25 or so on sale?
15-06-2019T23:56:12,AspiringNoodle,"That's not bad.  That said, Affinity isn't as steep a discount.  It's only $10 off when base price is $50 as well"
15-06-2019T23:56:40,AspiringNoodle,"Maybe a bit of tonight, and tomorrow / tuesday will be hardcore comparison / feel testing"
15-06-2019T23:56:46,Bgrmystr2,yeah CSP has a MASSIVE discount considering the base price is like.. what $70 or 80?
15-06-2019T23:56:54,AspiringNoodle,It is also $50 :D
15-06-2019T23:57:12,Bgrmystr2,ah is it?
15-06-2019T23:57:30,Bgrmystr2,okay then I was thinking of the EX version
15-06-2019T23:57:30,Dadrobit,"Damn, just saw a sad video. Dude OD'd on a bud. Paramedics are called. They bring him back with narcan and he walks off the bus. Cops start questioning him and he pulls a gun and manages to shoot and kill the firefighter that saved him."
15-06-2019T23:57:37,Dadrobit,on a bus*
15-06-2019T23:57:39,Bgrmystr2,which drops to like 70 or 80 dollars on sale
15-06-2019T23:57:50,AspiringNoodle,Woooooow
15-06-2019T23:57:52,Bgrmystr2,"if I recall correctly, yeah"
15-06-2019T23:58:08,AspiringNoodle,"Well, more to Dad's message"
15-06-2019T23:58:17,AspiringNoodle,But I am familiar with EX's pricing xD
15-06-2019T23:58:29,Bgrmystr2,wow dadro
15-06-2019T23:59:01,Bgrmystr2,fuckin hero.. and what does he get? Ded'd.
15-06-2019T23:59:04,Bgrmystr2,that's sad
15-06-2019T23:59:27,AspiringNoodle,"I tend to be very reserved when it comes to gun control issues, but drugs are a serious issue"
15-06-2019T23:59:49,AspiringNoodle,"Like, that dude was clearly out of his mind from the drugs, and he was armed.  Super bad combo :("
