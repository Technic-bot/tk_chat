15-05-2019T01:36:21,Twokinds,nice
15-05-2019T01:36:37,Twokinds,"Hm, what else do I need to put on Nora sheet"
15-05-2019T01:40:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Height and weight checked off?
15-05-2019T01:41:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Actually I do have a bit of a question - can she feel her horns like a limb or are they more like fingernails
15-05-2019T01:48:49,Twokinds,Uh... that's a good question.
15-05-2019T01:49:38,Twokinds,Do animals feel their horns? I don't know.
15-05-2019T01:50:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Well
15-05-2019T01:50:20,Bgrmystr2,"well, you could say it's like a turtle's shell. They can actually feel when you touch the shell, though it's not like their skin. It's different, but I don't think we fully understand how"
15-05-2019T01:50:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Pax man frogs have tiny lil horns above their eyes. It‚Äôs like their skin
15-05-2019T01:51:33,Bgrmystr2,"it comes down to if dragons have nerves in their horns. They don't need pain receptors, but nerves would probably be useful in some way"
15-05-2019T01:51:46,Twokinds,I assume Nora can feel them like I can feel my teeth.
15-05-2019T01:51:55,SpazztasticKiwi,"But as for horns and spines on animals, it depends on the animal. If they‚Äôre like rhino horns - functional and part of the body with blood supply - she likely feels them like that"
15-05-2019T01:52:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Most horns are for dominant displays and fights
15-05-2019T01:52:56,SpazztasticKiwi,The rhino. Rhino beetle. Deer
15-05-2019T01:53:00,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, our teeth are bones, unlike shells, we don't have nerves on the surface so we don't feel through them, but since they're so short, we can feel the base with very little movement"
15-05-2019T01:53:18,SpazztasticKiwi,So Nora has head teeth
15-05-2019T01:53:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Thanks for the nightmares
15-05-2019T01:53:40,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-confused::ptv-sneakysmirk: uh.. yup. Intentional. You're welcome or whatever.
15-05-2019T01:53:55,Bgrmystr2,"Also, nom."
15-05-2019T01:55:14,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúWhat big horns you have‚Äù ‚Äúthe better to eat you up with my dear‚Äù ‚Äúwhat‚Äù
15-05-2019T01:55:35,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-laugh: jeez and I thought Nora was scary before.
15-05-2019T01:56:11,SpazztasticKiwi,"Well with her....desires, I could see it being a thing"
15-05-2019T01:56:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Unfortunately
15-05-2019T01:57:06,SpazztasticKiwi,And to think I was peacefully watching cartoons a second ago
15-05-2019T02:05:18,Bgrmystr2,haha ruined.
15-05-2019T02:12:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Another note‚Äôs I tried a dress on for the first time since sr prom
15-05-2019T02:14:26,SpazztasticKiwi,straps gave me a second of Flow flashbacks
15-05-2019T02:19:59,Twokinds,I haven't worn a dress since prom either.
15-05-2019T02:21:12,SpazztasticKiwi,and another nightmare to add to the pile
15-05-2019T02:21:43,SpazztasticKiwi,And flashbacks to Mark wearing that Elsa dress
15-05-2019T02:21:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Make it stop
15-05-2019T02:22:10,Bgrmystr2,hahahaha
15-05-2019T02:35:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh I never did mention this lady that had a fit over not getting salmon did i
15-05-2019T02:37:43,Twokinds,who cares about salmon that much?
15-05-2019T02:39:34,iliar,salmon??? What are you talking about?
15-05-2019T02:39:55,Twokinds,"Phew, I think I'm done with the Nora sheet."
15-05-2019T02:39:56,SpazztasticKiwi,We close at 8. Fryers at 6:30-7:00. And this lady came in 8:18 - wants us to cook some salmon for her. Hot case was already near cleared out - salmons one of the first things tossed most of the time
15-05-2019T02:40:05,iliar,Nice
15-05-2019T02:40:28,SpazztasticKiwi,She upset cause we tell her we can‚Äôt - we closed
15-05-2019T02:40:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Cue the hallelujah chorus Tom?
15-05-2019T02:41:55,SpazztasticKiwi,And that lady apparently cares about salmon that much. Muttered something about needing it for a party or some such
15-05-2019T02:45:49,Twokinds,I'm always afraid there is not enough info
15-05-2019T02:45:55,Twokinds,But there's a lot of info on here
15-05-2019T02:46:13,Twokinds,Stupid giant Nora's giant tail and wings made it hard to fit the text.
15-05-2019T02:47:41,iliar,Well ... you can always increase the size of the canvas and place as much text as you need.
15-05-2019T02:48:55,iliar,A huge canvas full of text. And tiny Nora in the center.
15-05-2019T02:49:37,Twokinds,I want all the ref sheets to be the same size
15-05-2019T02:51:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Have her hold a sign of info. Tinder profile style
15-05-2019T02:54:23,iliar,I hope there will be at least a few words about her relationship with Trace. You cut this moment out of the comic.
15-05-2019T03:08:17,Twokinds,Gnight
15-05-2019T03:09:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Night Tom
15-05-2019T03:09:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Whys human Keith look like Trace
15-05-2019T03:12:26,iliar,"Good night, Tom"
15-05-2019T03:57:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Guys
15-05-2019T03:58:08,SpazztasticKiwi,This guy I went to high school with is missing

15-05-2019T11:21:29,CrimsonQuill,Hullo Tom
15-05-2019T11:38:06,CrimsonQuill,I've just seen the Nora Reference sheet...wow.
15-05-2019T11:38:29,CrimsonQuill,You really put in an enormous amount of work on this Tom...I hope it didn't take too much out of you?
15-05-2019T11:38:34,CrimsonQuill,It's amazing.
15-05-2019T11:47:09,Twokinds,It took me all night to finish.
15-05-2019T11:47:27,Twokinds,It's a lot of writing.
15-05-2019T11:47:27,CrimsonQuill,"Woah,"
15-05-2019T11:47:32,CrimsonQuill,I see that.
15-05-2019T11:47:44,CrimsonQuill,"It's really interesting about the Mana crystals, though."
15-05-2019T11:57:39,Sclimshady,"Way to go Nora,  fight the mask power."
15-05-2019T12:00:24,CrimsonQuill,It's always good if the masks are screwed over
15-05-2019T12:00:52,CrimsonQuill,They're like the Auditors from Terry Pratchett's Discworld...if not worse...
15-05-2019T12:01:10,CrimsonQuill,"Well, not quite anyhow."
15-05-2019T12:11:26,BadFoMo,"Sorry, but the last 'Other Info'; Shouldn't it be 'Masks' and not 'Mask'?"
15-05-2019T12:30:53,Twokinds,"Yeah, thanks. Fix'd"
15-05-2019T12:41:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Interesting there‚Äôs height weight length and sex but no ‚Äúbust‚Äù
15-05-2019T12:42:00,SpazztasticKiwi,"And the writing‚Äôs any tinier, you could fit much more stuff"
15-05-2019T12:55:29,SpazztasticKiwi,plenty tiny. I‚Äôve been told I write awful small
15-05-2019T13:32:51,Twokinds,lol
15-05-2019T13:32:52,Twokinds,Yeah
15-05-2019T13:32:58,Twokinds,It was a lot of info
15-05-2019T13:56:34,SpazztasticKiwi,They say messy handwriting is a sign of a great mind while neatness is a sign of a crowded mind. I can be either or
15-05-2019T13:56:54,SpazztasticKiwi,no in between
15-05-2019T13:57:13,CrimsonQuill,My handwriting is atrocius.
15-05-2019T13:58:14,CrimsonQuill,Absolutely atrocious.
15-05-2019T13:58:24,CrimsonQuill,And I do not have a great mind...
15-05-2019T13:58:28,CrimsonQuill,sobs
15-05-2019T14:08:42,Xexanoth,ok wow that is a lot of text

15-05-2019T14:15:19,FenceEqualizer,Can Deconfirm have bad handwriting and mind lacks greatness. Also I think this is the largest Ref sheet yet. Just so much info.
15-05-2019T14:20:05,Sclimshady,You need a lot of info when there's a lot of woman.
15-05-2019T14:20:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Someone has a sense of humor https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/524825976597643265/578662882473017385/image0.jpg
15-05-2019T14:30:58,Azumachan,No karen haircut ?
15-05-2019T14:33:17,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs got the hair
15-05-2019T14:36:15,Azumachan,Great work on Nora Tom.
15-05-2019T14:44:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Nora lookin like she could eat you up
15-05-2019T14:59:07,BadFoMo,Nora: Yes... I /could/ eat you; but where's the fun in that?
15-05-2019T15:19:29,FloofyCat,"Hey Tom, just wanna say the idea of mana crystals growing around where dragons hang out and sleep is awesome, adds some real risk to trying to get them and a fair bit of value since it seems like risky business."
15-05-2019T15:43:00,Mippy,:ptv-shock: my sub ran out!
15-05-2019T15:54:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Wasn‚Äôt it gone last night
15-05-2019T15:59:12,CrimsonQuill,Hi Mippy
15-05-2019T15:59:36,Mippy,Was I here last night? :ptv-wondering:

15-05-2019T16:34:34,Bgrmystr2,"@Floofy Dragons don't seem to stay in the same place all the time, so it more makes sense that they could just grab the crystals when the dragon isn't there, or has moved elsewhere."
15-05-2019T16:37:24,CrimsonQuill,Night night everyone

15-05-2019T16:45:06,AspiringNoodle,They... they just do
15-05-2019T17:43:13,SpazztasticKiwi,what can stick something in place firmly without being permanent or leaving stain
15-05-2019T17:57:19,AspiringNoodle,No idea
15-05-2019T18:59:33,Dadrobit,Stainless non-permanent glue I'd imagine?
15-05-2019T19:33:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Amy out here helping Mark get some model shots of some hot new retro socks
15-05-2019T19:33:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Dunno what he did to his knee though
15-05-2019T20:10:08,SpazztasticKiwi,I need to go to the museum with the titanoboa and megalodon statues
