23-02-2019T17:29:34,Bgrmystr2,and don't all like the same thing
23-02-2019T17:29:43,ThingsAreMoving,Because some people didn't like it I'd presume
23-02-2019T17:29:45,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Because brie larson is kind of a dick

23-02-2019T17:30:47,CrimsonQuill,Three conversations going on at once
23-02-2019T17:30:47,Mippy,Because woman? I don’t know. People seem to freak out when a female version of a character is used. Or it could just be a bad movie. Haven’t seen it so I would not know.
23-02-2019T17:30:51,CrRAR,eating the food will quiet the food

23-02-2019T18:02:09,BearFlipsTable,thats why its so japanese
23-02-2019T18:02:22,HobbitGames,I do like reading things before watching the movies
23-02-2019T18:02:23,BearFlipsTable,plus alita sounds japanese
23-02-2019T18:02:37,HobbitGames,(Ready Player Lne im looking at you)

23-02-2019T18:02:54,BearFlipsTable,"i did that with The Hobbit and was disappointed by beorn, just cause he and his house didnt live up to the image in my head"
23-02-2019T18:02:57,MrRetroRealm,ty
23-02-2019T18:03:07,Mippy,"I don’t think Alita sounds particularly Japanese, Bear"

23-02-2019T18:03:16,BearFlipsTable,i think so
23-02-2019T18:03:20,BearFlipsTable,like akita
23-02-2019T18:03:23,BearFlipsTable,alita
23-02-2019T18:03:32,Bgrmystr2,"if it's better in the movie, the manga should probably be read first so you see what the source material is and then see how it was improved."
23-02-2019T18:03:32,MrRetroRealm,Now I is gonna try to stream as well while watching awesome artists draw as well : P
23-02-2019T18:03:41,HobbitGames,"I read the Hobbit when i was younger, and i know I enjoyed it, but most of the imagery had partly left me when ibwatched the movies. Still goood movies imo"

23-02-2019T18:03:58,NeonMitsumi,Alita sounds more Italian
23-02-2019T18:04:02,ThingsAreMoving,live action sucks like most adaptations
23-02-2019T18:04:02,Bgrmystr2,lol.. Zak I would comment on that but spoilers.
23-02-2019T18:04:03,Xexanoth,the problem is that the manga is about 180 chapters and the movie obviously only covers the early ones.
23-02-2019T18:04:05,MrRetroRealm,Oh we talking about Alita: Battle Angel?
23-02-2019T18:04:12,Zakuru,no i mean

23-02-2019T21:03:26,MuonNeutrino,it's really quite impressive how readily you can still tell that's keith despite sharing basically no colors other than the eyes

23-02-2019T21:04:39,RimaDraws,not really...
23-02-2019T21:04:40,CatzArt,SIgh!
23-02-2019T21:04:42,ThingsAreMoving,"FoMo, get a spray bottle, fill it with cold water and spray yourself"
23-02-2019T21:04:44,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Next up is best girl :cmarvthehugpharaoh-ezgifcom-crop6:
23-02-2019T21:04:52,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-rose:
23-02-2019T21:04:55,BadFoMo,Actually I stole this name from 12oz. Mouse.
23-02-2019T21:04:56,MuonNeutrino,"yes, it is. and raine is cute too =P"
23-02-2019T21:04:58,unsteddyphoenix,Fem Zen and Natani
23-02-2019T21:05:02,CatzArt,Thats it Im getting the baguette!
23-02-2019T21:05:12,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Teddy knows what I like
23-02-2019T21:05:17,CrRAR,*chatters skedaddle*
23-02-2019T21:05:19,CatzArt,MARV!
23-02-2019T21:05:29,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"What, Fem Zen is cute"
23-02-2019T21:05:32,MuonNeutrino,"so now the question, is tom going to color rose as old rose or young rose"
23-02-2019T21:05:42,CatzArt,young
23-02-2019T21:05:45,Mippy,Missed a bit. Had my glasses off to brush hair
23-02-2019T21:05:47,Ordithus,Looks like a younger Rose than the current
23-02-2019T21:06:04,BadFoMo,Maybe DM Rose?
23-02-2019T21:06:07,unsteddyphoenix,Though that doesnt quite make sense
23-02-2019T21:06:08,Psychotic1999,I missed the last part of the last sketch. How did the sketch look with color?
23-02-2019T21:06:10,Ordithus,Maybe having the happiness of family has rejuvenated her <3
23-02-2019T21:06:10,MuonNeutrino,"it presumably would be old rose if he wanted to stick with the timeline, but yeah i agree at least in the sketch rose looked younger"
23-02-2019T21:06:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Rose had a spa day, melted the wrinkles away"
23-02-2019T21:06:22,MuonNeutrino,"@BadFoMo problem is that was still 5 years ago, raine would have been 13"
23-02-2019T21:06:47,Katfeathers,"I'll be back, food has arived"
23-02-2019T21:06:52,unsteddyphoenix,Or maybe shes just old version but letting her hair down
23-02-2019T21:06:57,Ordithus,Enjoy your foods Katfeathers
23-02-2019T21:06:59,MuonNeutrino,"that is the other option, yes"
23-02-2019T21:07:03,w0lfmare,Keidran age gracfully
23-02-2019T21:07:15,RimaDraws,everyone says i look 21 but im 31
23-02-2019T21:07:20,Mippy,These are the two ladies playing Wolf Raine and Youn Rose in the Twokinds movie
23-02-2019T21:07:22,unsteddyphoenix,"True, but she'd still show SOME signs probably"
23-02-2019T21:07:26,MuonNeutrino,i wish i was like that heh
23-02-2019T21:07:42,unsteddyphoenix,"Ahhh, the actors have become friends"
23-02-2019T21:07:53,Ordithus,The very bottom of this is relevant: https://www.deviantart.com/twokinds/art/Misc-Sketches-1-773004211
23-02-2019T21:08:22,MuonNeutrino,"yes, but rose is 26 heh"
23-02-2019T21:08:35,MuonNeutrino,"or thereabouts, anyway"
23-02-2019T21:08:40,Mippy,XD yup
23-02-2019T21:08:45,RimaDraws,possibly
23-02-2019T21:09:01,Psychotic1999,"If Rose is 26, she looks good for her Keidran years"
23-02-2019T21:09:04,MuonNeutrino,"well, just from the dating of the initial flashback as 19 years ago, and she had to be at least 7 in it...."
23-02-2019T21:09:06,Bgrmystr2,that fuckin flora face X'D
23-02-2019T21:09:11,Bgrmystr2,gets me every time
23-02-2019T21:09:15,MuonNeutrino,and yeah she looks good for 26
23-02-2019T21:09:49,IronHorseComics,"you know I just remembered something, how would the dragons look when they reach the point where they start looking old?"
23-02-2019T21:09:55,w0lfmare,"The ""tries to feed you all the time"" stage of life"
23-02-2019T21:10:14,Ordithus,"Nora is the oldest known dragon, so like her, Iron?"
23-02-2019T21:10:20,MuonNeutrino,"@IronHorseComics well, nora is over 2000 and she shows no signs of age"
23-02-2019T21:10:25,MuonNeutrino,we dont even know if dragons DO age
23-02-2019T21:10:26,Psychotic1999,They would probably just get gray hair and their wings would sag. That's my guess
23-02-2019T21:10:37,MuonNeutrino,"or, well, obviously they grow, but we don't know if they grow *old*"
23-02-2019T21:10:40,Psychotic1999,"Muon, that's true too"
23-02-2019T21:10:44,w0lfmare,Where are the grandma Flora requests
23-02-2019T21:10:57,Twokinds,Dragons only get stronger with age.
23-02-2019T21:11:00,MuonNeutrino,i personally assume dragons are immortal
23-02-2019T21:11:02,MuonNeutrino,yeah that
23-02-2019T21:11:08,Mippy,Grandma Flora needs a comeback
23-02-2019T21:11:35,ThingsAreMoving,"Alright people. As much as I'd love to stay, I need my sleep. Thanks for the entertainment Tom! See ya all next time!"
23-02-2019T21:11:38,ThingsAreMoving,:ctwokinds-nibsbounce:
23-02-2019T21:11:39,Psychotic1999,"I have never seen Grandma Flora. Please someone request that, I need to be treated"

23-02-2019T21:12:02,w0lfmare,"Will Reni eventually get more graceful, or will the derping only get stronger as well?"
23-02-2019T21:12:12,unsteddyphoenix,"Oh, gnight Thigns <3"
23-02-2019T21:12:15,Ordithus,haha
23-02-2019T21:12:16,Mippy,Bye Things. We won’t forget you
23-02-2019T21:12:19,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I hope she derps stronger
23-02-2019T21:12:28,RimaDraws,gramma flora
23-02-2019T21:12:30,RimaDraws,<3
23-02-2019T21:12:35,MuonNeutrino,she can be the patron saint of derp
23-02-2019T21:12:37,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-reniderp:*[derp life]
23-02-2019T21:12:38,unsteddyphoenix,POWERFUL derps
23-02-2019T21:12:48,unsteddyphoenix,Far more impactful crashes
23-02-2019T21:12:50,MuonNeutrino,the most powerful derp to have ever derped
23-02-2019T21:12:58,w0lfmare,All young dragons being derpy could be fun as well :thinking:
23-02-2019T21:13:12,Justinblazer,Wolfmare do you have money for free on sale 💰
23-02-2019T21:13:13,MuonNeutrino,"@unsteddyphoenix lol good point, imagine the carnage if *nora* crashed the way reni did"
23-02-2019T21:13:17,Bgrmystr2,big derps are best derps
23-02-2019T21:13:18,unsteddyphoenix,They experience an insane amount of growth very quickly
23-02-2019T21:13:22,unsteddyphoenix,So it makes sense
23-02-2019T21:13:22,MuonNeutrino,given she's the size of a jet heh
23-02-2019T21:13:27,w0lfmare,wat
23-02-2019T21:13:31,Psychotic1999,Nora crashing would cause a crater
23-02-2019T21:13:40,unsteddyphoenix,"Like, Renis massive and shes 20"
23-02-2019T21:13:43,IronHorseComics,hmmmm
23-02-2019T21:13:44,Mippy,"Well, kids are just derpy humans."
23-02-2019T21:13:53,Justinblazer,Is there anyone have money for free I need cash this time 💵
23-02-2019T21:13:59,unsteddyphoenix,No time to get used to her limbs before she grows again
23-02-2019T21:14:06,MuonNeutrino,eternal growth spurt
23-02-2019T21:14:10,unsteddyphoenix,Probably has to adjust flying every time her wings grow too
23-02-2019T21:14:13,unsteddyphoenix,Exactly
23-02-2019T21:14:14,MuonNeutrino,"or, at least, longer than for humans"
23-02-2019T21:14:16,IronHorseComics,"after seeing real life fighter jets in museums, Nora and Reni are smaller"
23-02-2019T21:14:24,IronHorseComics,Reni moreso
23-02-2019T21:14:47,Psychotic1999,It's like a small toy jet gradually aging to a full sized jet
23-02-2019T21:14:54,MuonNeutrino,"reni is, nora... some of those shots make her look the size of the ship heh"
23-02-2019T21:15:12,Psychotic1999,I think Nora would be bigger than a jet and Reni just being a bit smaller
23-02-2019T21:15:12,Mippy,For some reason I’m just playing with my hair ball. I need to throw this thing out
23-02-2019T21:15:18,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah I think Tom actually draws her smaller than she actually is a lot of the time
23-02-2019T21:15:22,IronHorseComics,"if she were the size of a jet, she'd never be able to fit inside a restaurant like that one sketch where she's dating that soldier"
23-02-2019T21:15:38,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-keithdotdotdot: mippy wat
23-02-2019T21:15:45,MuonNeutrino,"reni isn't the size of a jet, yes. nora... kinda is"
23-02-2019T21:15:54,Psychotic1999,"I have an afro, Mippy and I like playing with my hair. I'm weird like that"
23-02-2019T21:15:59,ThorburnCreative,...Nora can change size at will. remember the cat?
23-02-2019T21:16:10,Mippy,I have a wad of hair I pulled out of my brush
23-02-2019T21:16:11,MuonNeutrino,"well yeah, talking about her *normal* size"
23-02-2019T21:16:30,Psychotic1999,"Mippy, same. I don't use conditioner just shampoo"
23-02-2019T21:16:46,Ordithus,Oh.  That makes snese
23-02-2019T21:16:48,Ordithus,*sense
23-02-2019T21:17:06,CatzArt,eww mippy toss it
23-02-2019T21:17:20,Psychotic1999,The amount of hair I pull out of my brush every day could give a bald guy hair within a month
23-02-2019T21:17:34,CatzArt,See I dont have this problem
23-02-2019T21:17:47,Mippy,To be fair Catz...it’s my hair. I don’t find it gross
23-02-2019T21:18:12,unsteddyphoenix,You know where its beem
23-02-2019T21:18:12,CatzArt,I know! When it happens to me i find it gross.
23-02-2019T21:18:19,MuonNeutrino,"i mean, look at nora herehttp://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/395/"
23-02-2019T21:18:26,Mippy,Exactly Teddy
23-02-2019T21:18:29,MuonNeutrino,she's like 2/3rds the size of the ship next to her XD
23-02-2019T21:18:41,Ordithus,Puny boat
23-02-2019T21:18:49,CatzArt,ANd i know where its been. When you work with wildlife you gotta shower shower shower shower.

23-02-2019T21:19:02,MuonNeutrino,"it's not a huge boat, no, but nora kinda is big XD"
23-02-2019T21:19:02,unsteddyphoenix,Or here
23-02-2019T21:19:14,MuonNeutrino,"not a jumbo jet, but fighter jet sure"
23-02-2019T21:19:21,Mippy,Basitin to dragon: Get out of the way
23-02-2019T21:19:29,Psychotic1999,"Dang, Nora is huge. Definitely bigger than a jet"
23-02-2019T21:19:33,Mippy,Dragon: :ptv-shock:
23-02-2019T21:19:49,CatzArt,How big is Uh Raine?
23-02-2019T21:19:59,Ordithus,Nobody knows~
23-02-2019T21:20:02,Ordithus,She can't pick a size
23-02-2019T21:20:03,CatzArt,fighter jet maybe?
23-02-2019T21:20:04,IronHorseComics,had no clue that Kei was a tall dude

23-02-2019T21:20:17,Ordithus,Kei is the same height as Zen
23-02-2019T21:20:28,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Zen's cuter tho
23-02-2019T21:20:31,MuonNeutrino,"well my link was obviously to a comic, so that's safe"
23-02-2019T21:20:31,Mippy,KeixReni=OTP
23-02-2019T21:20:38,CatzArt,Didnt we used to have a link rule?
23-02-2019T21:20:43,Ordithus,"And the other link came from steddy, a mod"
23-02-2019T21:20:47,FreelancerAgentMaine,I'm back again
23-02-2019T21:20:48,Ordithus,"So, I hope we could trust him"
23-02-2019T21:20:54,MuonNeutrino,"yes, but links to tom's stuff has always been exempt"

23-02-2019T21:21:14,MuonNeutrino,"at least, if the link is recognizable"
23-02-2019T21:21:21,Ordithus,^ also
23-02-2019T21:21:25,CatzArt,fair enough
23-02-2019T21:21:29,unsteddyphoenix,Unless sage is here
23-02-2019T21:21:35,CatzArt,oh yeah
23-02-2019T21:21:36,unsteddyphoenix,Then...dont tell him I said that
23-02-2019T21:21:45,Mippy,Sage over rules Teddy
23-02-2019T21:21:45,Ordithus,Sage is fine with links to streamers' stuff
23-02-2019T21:21:55,Ordithus,As long as the link is obvious
23-02-2019T21:21:55,SageSaga,correct
23-02-2019T21:22:01,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Sage o/

23-02-2019T21:22:13,Psychotic1999,A wild Sage appears out of nowhere
23-02-2019T21:22:29,IronHorseComics,looking at the scale of an F-22 to a human... yeah the F-22 is much bigger than Reni
23-02-2019T21:22:35,SageSaga,"also im thinking about saying ""So long as you give a description of the link before the link its fine to post"" naturally so long as its SFW and all that"
23-02-2019T21:22:44,CatzArt,Nobody expects the Sage-sage inquisition! Run Pheonix youve been caught!
23-02-2019T21:22:52,CatzArt,sage sage?
23-02-2019T21:22:53,unsteddyphoenix,Note that kei is a llot bigger than an average human too
23-02-2019T21:22:57,MuonNeutrino,yeah reni is more just... two horses or something
23-02-2019T21:23:04,MuonNeutrino,nora is the huge one
23-02-2019T21:23:06,Ordithus,"Eh, some quality control is fine, Sage.  We've had folks wanting to link memes before"
23-02-2019T21:23:16,Mippy,Like....this is a eraser www.like.com/eraser
23-02-2019T21:23:21,SageSaga,i'll still delete links i dont like
23-02-2019T21:23:26,IronHorseComics,"oh, in that case Sage, mind if I post the image link here? just to show how big jets actually are?"
23-02-2019T21:23:26,CatzArt,I never really noticed how tall Kei was
23-02-2019T21:23:28,unsteddyphoenix,That could be fine now Sage
23-02-2019T21:23:30,MuonNeutrino,reni is still big compared to a human but isn't jet sized
23-02-2019T21:23:42,unsteddyphoenix,"Since more mods have been recruited, we can be quicker on deleting bad links"

23-02-2019T22:37:35,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Teddy, wanna die in apex?"
23-02-2019T22:39:08,CrRAR,Funest way to die
23-02-2019T22:39:36,SpazztasticKiwi,"Or stay up longer, play some apex like you said, and not be able to sleep when it is bedtime"
23-02-2019T22:39:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Your choice. But I say night night Tom
23-02-2019T22:40:01,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Who needs sleep when you RE 45ing people like a mad lad

23-02-2019T22:44:28,Twokinds,came close to choking to death just a moment ago
23-02-2019T22:44:43,unsteddyphoenix,:O
23-02-2019T22:44:44,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Don't so that please

23-02-2019T22:45:04,unsteddyphoenix,Ahh. Well done steak. No wonder.
23-02-2019T22:45:06,Ordithus,"Tom, this keeps happening.  SLOW DOWN"
23-02-2019T22:45:07,Twokinds,The stream kept me from eating most of it so I was making up for lost time
23-02-2019T22:45:11,RimaDraws,noooo tom don't do that
23-02-2019T22:45:21,RimaDraws,no choking
23-02-2019T22:45:28,Twokinds,I thought I was a gonner for a sec XD
23-02-2019T22:45:34,unsteddyphoenix,"See, if you cook your steak less"
23-02-2019T22:45:34,RimaDraws,;;
23-02-2019T22:45:41,unsteddyphoenix,You'll find that you can actually chew it!
23-02-2019T22:45:49,unsteddyphoenix,You should try it! :O
23-02-2019T22:46:40,RimaDraws,please be more careful
23-02-2019T22:47:58,Ordithus,Mmm rare steak is da bomb
23-02-2019T22:48:01,Ordithus,So tender

23-02-2019T22:48:12,RimaDraws,medium rare

23-02-2019T22:48:40,CrRAR,"In a cinch a chair can be used to do the heimlich. Still, yeah, don’t let that happen."
23-02-2019T22:48:42,Twokinds,Yeah death by steak is not the way I wanna go
23-02-2019T22:48:48,RimaDraws,LOL

23-02-2019T22:49:19,RimaDraws,like being squished between someones thighs
23-02-2019T22:49:30,Ordithus,At least it'd be quick and tasty

23-02-2019T22:55:05,Bgrmystr2,from when he got steak earlier in the stream but he was busy drawing instead of eating.
23-02-2019T22:55:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Oo. Dinner right before bed
23-02-2019T22:55:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Make sure you’re food tired

23-02-2019T23:02:29,Ordithus,d'aww
23-02-2019T23:02:43,Dadrobit,Howdy y'all!
23-02-2019T23:02:50,Ordithus,I am getting closer to kitty of my own~
23-02-2019T23:02:55,CrRAR,Howdy robit!
23-02-2019T23:02:55,Ordithus,"Hi robit, great timing!"
23-02-2019T23:02:58,SpazztasticKiwi,You missed everything
23-02-2019T23:03:24,CrRAR,Fantastic news ord!
23-02-2019T23:03:27,Dadrobit,As is tradition!
23-02-2019T23:03:37,CrRAR,:D
23-02-2019T23:03:49,Dadrobit,I'm gonna take a wild stab and guess that bookclub didn't make the cut.
23-02-2019T23:03:51,Ordithus,"I just need a little more work on the house, then a cat will not hate me for introducing it to horrible noises"
23-02-2019T23:03:54,Ordithus,"Sadly, no"
23-02-2019T23:04:07,Dadrobit,Too many naked ladies for the nerds to have a chance.
23-02-2019T23:04:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Your wild stab hit the target
23-02-2019T23:04:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi dad
23-02-2019T23:04:30,Twokinds,"If I could have voted, bookclub would have been one of mine."
23-02-2019T23:04:33,Ordithus,"It was human Kat, babysitting Kat, bathing Laura, vixen Keith, and Raine + Rose (the cootest)"
23-02-2019T23:04:46,SpazztasticKiwi,We got convenient covered Kat at the Cafe
23-02-2019T23:04:55,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I voted bookclub. Need more Ember art
23-02-2019T23:05:06,Dadrobit,":D Thanks for the votes, both real and otherwise"
23-02-2019T23:05:11,CrRAR,Haha
23-02-2019T23:05:18,Ordithus,"She hasn't been colored by Tom yet, has she?"
23-02-2019T23:05:29,SpazztasticKiwi,I remember I voted for Kat and the snuggle one
23-02-2019T23:05:35,Ordithus,Or maybe it was something he did before the whole patreon sketch suggestions...
23-02-2019T23:05:38,CrRAR,I seem to recall
23-02-2019T23:05:54,RimaDraws,hi dadro
23-02-2019T23:06:41,Dadrobit,"I think my next suggestion is either going to be Sam and Colin decorating the Christmas tree, or Alaric studying Maddie being impossible aerodynamic in a wind tunnel."
23-02-2019T23:06:51,Dadrobit,impossibly*
23-02-2019T23:07:34,Ordithus,Odd timing for the first one
23-02-2019T23:07:53,unsteddyphoenix,Not if he requests it for 10 more months!
23-02-2019T23:07:55,unsteddyphoenix,Also hi daddy
23-02-2019T23:08:08,Dadrobit,"Nah, by the time folks get behind it, or Tom finally picks it, it'll be right on time."
23-02-2019T23:08:14,Ordithus,lol
23-02-2019T23:08:18,Dadrobit,o/ Rima and unsteddy
23-02-2019T23:08:33,CrRAR,Haha
23-02-2019T23:09:02,Dadrobit,Bookclub is actually now my longest running suggestion. It took longer even than the Keith and Maddie romantic dinner suggestion.
23-02-2019T23:09:12,Ordithus,Wow.
23-02-2019T23:09:21,unsteddyphoenix,How long?
23-02-2019T23:09:34,Ordithus,I don't know if I've run the same exact suggestion more than a month...
23-02-2019T23:09:41,Dadrobit,close to 8 or 9 months IIRC
23-02-2019T23:10:05,Ordithus,Usually when I win a vote or get picked it was the first time I posted it
23-02-2019T23:10:42,Dadrobit,8 months. It was my primary suggestion after Squirrel Rider.
23-02-2019T23:10:50,unsteddyphoenix,Brag about it
23-02-2019T23:11:13,unsteddyphoenix,Its been ages since i've been picked/voted.
23-02-2019T23:11:14,Dadrobit,But I did take one month off for Dust going as Fidget for Halloween.
23-02-2019T23:11:20,unsteddyphoenix,But I constantly switch it up
23-02-2019T23:12:27,Twokinds,But that one won!
23-02-2019T23:12:52,Dadrobit,\o/
23-02-2019T23:13:48,Bgrmystr2,maybe you should switch up more often dadro
23-02-2019T23:13:51,Bgrmystr2,maybe you'd win more
23-02-2019T23:14:12,Dadrobit,"It was a Tom Pick, but the people understood once it'd been sketched of what true #Quality is."
23-02-2019T23:14:31,Dadrobit,"""No one really knows what they want until you give it to them."""
23-02-2019T23:14:56,Ordithus,I think most of my wins were Tom picks... <3
23-02-2019T23:15:21,RimaDraws,and i finished chapter one
23-02-2019T23:15:33,Ordithus,My most recent was just a fun addition to what actually won the vote
23-02-2019T23:15:34,RimaDraws,most of mine were too
23-02-2019T23:15:36,unsteddyphoenix,Think im about half n half
23-02-2019T23:15:40,unsteddyphoenix,Oh yeah lol
23-02-2019T23:15:57,Ordithus,"""Lingerie added for Ordithus"" :ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:"
23-02-2019T23:16:11,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
23-02-2019T23:16:20,RimaDraws,small one but it is done for now.
23-02-2019T23:16:42,unsteddyphoenix,extremely good addition
23-02-2019T23:16:43,Dadrobit,"Ha, I almost forgot about that."
23-02-2019T23:17:18,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Ord sam for me, most were picks"
23-02-2019T23:17:21,MarvTheHugPharaoh,same
23-02-2019T23:18:54,RimaDraws,yea all my roselyn ones are tom picks.
23-02-2019T23:19:02,Ordithus,Mike modeling as a male was practically a bet between us
23-02-2019T23:19:25,unsteddyphoenix,Did you get my message Tom?
23-02-2019T23:19:56,Bgrmystr2,I really was hoping for a human lingerie Saria though
23-02-2019T23:20:05,Bgrmystr2,:C
23-02-2019T23:20:08,Twokinds,so tired
23-02-2019T23:20:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Sleep
23-02-2019T23:20:23,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m about to
23-02-2019T23:20:31,Ordithus,Getting there myself
23-02-2019T23:20:36,unsteddyphoenix,"Hey, fair if you enough"
23-02-2019T23:20:48,SpazztasticKiwi,After I put my lil pet in it’s safe spot so it’s not squished
23-02-2019T23:21:00,Dadrobit,Need advice. I have two options. 1) Go to sleep and get a good night's rest before going into a radio station to talk shop. Or 2) Stay up and play more Caustic on Apex until I get a win with him.
23-02-2019T23:21:01,SpazztasticKiwi,It took 6 hoursish to do
23-02-2019T23:21:19,KiTA,sleep.
23-02-2019T23:21:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe factor in a single hour of game. Maybe
23-02-2019T23:21:33,Ordithus,Sleep is good.  You can game after the thing
23-02-2019T23:21:52,SpazztasticKiwi,But only if you can stick to it. Though if it’s already late for you - it can wait
23-02-2019T23:24:41,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m already snuggled up. Just about ten more minutes and I’ll be finishing Seán’s RE vid and it’s off to bed
23-02-2019T23:25:13,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m actually turning in early! I’m so responsible
23-02-2019T23:27:21,RimaDraws,lol
