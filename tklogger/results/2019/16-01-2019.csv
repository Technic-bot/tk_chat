16-01-2019T00:41:05,SageSaga,i made grilled cheese without the bread
16-01-2019T00:41:19,Ordithus,aka... cheese
16-01-2019T00:41:30,SageSaga,but i grilled the cheese...
16-01-2019T00:41:42,Ordithus,So... grilled cheese
16-01-2019T00:41:44,AshtonFinel,Hi
16-01-2019T00:41:47,Bgrmystr2,which is what sage said.
16-01-2019T00:41:51,Bgrmystr2,also hello again
16-01-2019T00:42:00,SageSaga,hello Ashton

16-01-2019T00:42:27,Ordithus,Sage is blowing my mind :ctwokinds-zenshocked:
16-01-2019T00:42:33,Bgrmystr2,haha
16-01-2019T00:42:54,w0lfmare,How... do you eat just melted cheese?
16-01-2019T00:43:01,Bgrmystr2,"not melted, grilled"
16-01-2019T00:43:05,SageSaga,i made like a tortilla out of cheese- and then i put bacon inside it
16-01-2019T00:43:09,MarvTheHugPharaoh,with caution
16-01-2019T00:43:12,Bgrmystr2,"when it's finished, it's not melted anymore"
16-01-2019T00:43:28,Bgrmystr2,you can eat bacon
16-01-2019T00:43:29,Katibara,Mmm bacon
16-01-2019T00:43:31,Bgrmystr2,but not bread?
16-01-2019T00:43:37,Katibara,Low carb diet?
16-01-2019T00:43:40,SageSaga,yep
16-01-2019T00:43:43,Katibara,Keto lets you eat bacon.
16-01-2019T00:43:44,Bgrmystr2,"no, it's medical Kati"
16-01-2019T00:43:45,Ordithus,Bacon and bread are very different bgr
16-01-2019T00:43:53,Katibara,"Ohh, gluten. That beast."
16-01-2019T00:43:54,Bgrmystr2,yes I know Ord
16-01-2019T00:44:01,AshtonFinel,"Nice. I'm working on a drawing of two maid washing dishes, but one of them accidentally shrank, and is trying not to get crushed by the sponge that the other maid is using."
16-01-2019T00:44:09,SageSaga,carbs and sugars are my enemies
16-01-2019T00:44:17,Katibara,Same :C
16-01-2019T00:44:19,SageSaga,bacon and cheese do not have carbs
16-01-2019T00:44:27,Katibara,^
16-01-2019T00:44:29,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
16-01-2019T00:44:37,Katibara,"I do the keto diet, it's heaven to just... gorge on bacon."
16-01-2019T00:44:38,Bgrmystr2,yeah but you don't eat a bunch of other stuff too
16-01-2019T00:44:45,SageSaga,also you cant eat but so much bacon without getting sick- so its a tasty thing you can eat and often not over eat
16-01-2019T00:44:56,Katibara,You basically can use bacon like chips.
16-01-2019T00:45:02,SageSaga,so its great for portion control
16-01-2019T00:45:10,AshtonFinel,Ever had bacon wrapped shrimp?
16-01-2019T00:45:13,Ordithus,I think I could eat a LOT of bacon
16-01-2019T00:45:17,Katibara,Oh damn that sounds nice.
16-01-2019T00:45:36,SageSaga,"you would be surprised how quickly your body says ""THATS ENOUGH BACON!"""
16-01-2019T00:45:46,Ordithus,Never hit that point yet
16-01-2019T00:45:46,Katibara,It's the salt. x.x
16-01-2019T00:45:50,RimaDraws,night guys and thanks for streaming tom!
16-01-2019T00:45:51,AshtonFinel,I had bacon wrapped shrimp at a sushi place once.
16-01-2019T00:45:53,SageSaga,yeah the salt

16-01-2019T00:46:23,SageSaga,i cant eat more than 5 slices of thick cut bacon
16-01-2019T00:46:33,Katibara,Thick cut?
16-01-2019T00:46:36,MarvTheHugPharaoh,and the sound she made when she hit the wall
16-01-2019T00:46:37,Bgrmystr2,"sage, bacon crunchy or soft?"
16-01-2019T00:46:39,Katibara,That's... too thick. LOL
16-01-2019T00:46:43,Ordithus,I could eat a pound
16-01-2019T00:46:45,MarvTheHugPharaoh,kerthunk
16-01-2019T00:46:49,Katibara,You need to monopolize your eating habits.
16-01-2019T00:46:55,Katibara,Thin sliced bacon = more bacon
16-01-2019T00:46:57,SageSaga,and normal slices i can just barely eat 6
16-01-2019T00:47:09,Ordithus,Marv why
16-01-2019T00:47:11,Katibara,More bacon for your day.
16-01-2019T00:47:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I'm an audio ned
16-01-2019T00:47:25,MarvTheHugPharaoh,nerd
16-01-2019T00:47:43,SageSaga,thick cut isnt that much thicker but it has a lot more fat to cook off it and that adds to the flavor
16-01-2019T00:48:01,SpacePolicePoliceman,beautiful work Kameloh
16-01-2019T00:48:04,SpacePolicePoliceman,Imma go sleep now
16-01-2019T00:48:11,qwe304,You gotta step up you bacon game save
16-01-2019T00:48:11,Ordithus,Good night Space

16-01-2019T00:48:26,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nighty night space
16-01-2019T00:48:33,Katibara,"Ah, the fat is key to some diets (like Keto), but it's where that salt gets you."
16-01-2019T00:48:49,SageSaga,the salt is important on Keto though
16-01-2019T00:48:49,Bgrmystr2,"woah, the wobbly vision"
16-01-2019T00:48:59,Katibara,"I totally appreciate a good bacon though, so I feel you on the thick cut"
16-01-2019T00:49:03,Bgrmystr2,maddie really felt that
16-01-2019T00:49:18,Ordithus,She's not doing so well
16-01-2019T00:49:38,SageSaga,while on Keto you need to eat more salt to make up for the ketons that wipe out your electrolytes
16-01-2019T00:49:42,Ordithus,Karen better have a pickaxe somewhere
16-01-2019T00:49:51,Bgrmystr2,lol that one strand of karen's hair is also doubled.. nope wait tom got it
16-01-2019T00:50:01,Katibara,BOY do you gotta increase that salt intake.
16-01-2019T00:50:11,SageSaga,if this were a bad anime- Karen would turn INTO a pickaxe for her to use
16-01-2019T00:50:17,Katibara,But you can get it safer in other ways than in the meat.
16-01-2019T00:50:31,Katibara,"But if I could: bacon every day, all day."
16-01-2019T00:50:39,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-confused: ..um?
16-01-2019T00:50:41,SageSaga,yeah i dont have bacon every day
16-01-2019T00:50:46,Katibara,I do XD;
16-01-2019T00:50:49,Ordithus,"Hmm, I suppose with less processed foods your salt intake is actually way lower?"
16-01-2019T00:50:50,Twokinds,Shhhh
16-01-2019T00:50:50,Bgrmystr2,"I gert the feeling this is a specific anime you have watched, sage"
16-01-2019T00:50:52,Katibara,.____. but the thin slice.

16-01-2019T00:53:10,SageSaga,i stopped watching when they spent like 10 minutes explaining that its impossible for you to turn into a weapon and be a user as well- and the next episode they introduced 2 well known characters that would use each other seperately
16-01-2019T00:53:31,ChiptuneBrony,I drew a silly Tails fanart today.
16-01-2019T00:53:40,Katibara,Wow. That's one niche.

16-01-2019T00:57:44,Ordithus,He's sparing us
16-01-2019T00:57:46,Bgrmystr2,but it sounds somewhat more familiar as he talks about it..
16-01-2019T00:57:47,SageSaga,i dont even remember what it was- it was trash
16-01-2019T00:57:51,Bgrmystr2,"no, I don't want to be spared."
16-01-2019T00:57:54,SageSaga,i think it was mermaid something

16-01-2019T12:28:48,Kameloh,w0lf was worried that picarto would revert back to their old sub system where they keep 50%

16-01-2019T12:29:04,Twokinds,Did they change something?
16-01-2019T12:29:23,w0lfmare,Picarto subscriptions were a 50/50 cut when they were through Paypal before
16-01-2019T12:29:42,Kameloh,think they added paypal back again?
16-01-2019T12:30:22,Twokinds,I see
16-01-2019T12:30:25,w0lfmare,"When they switched to Stripe they went down to 10/90 which is like Patreon, then this month they switched back to Paypal"
16-01-2019T12:30:49,w0lfmare,"But it seems they're keeping the 10/90, thankfully"
16-01-2019T12:30:52,Kameloh,"yee, so the worry was whether switching back to paypal would go 50/50"
16-01-2019T12:30:55,Twokinds,They never responded to my suggestion of allowing the ability to gift subs.
16-01-2019T12:31:19,iliar,Not surprised
