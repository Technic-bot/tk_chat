23-11-2019T16:00:11,TeapotOfDoom,train company is government run
23-11-2019T16:00:31,ThingsAreMoving,That explains the poor wifi.
23-11-2019T16:00:32,TeapotOfDoom,the wifi is ok normally but just dies when to many people are on it
23-11-2019T16:00:51,TeapotOfDoom,also randomly like now cus the train's not that packed

23-11-2019T16:15:22,BadFoMo,Yo.
23-11-2019T16:15:28,ThingsAreMoving,I'm guessing Adelaide toppling a tower by lifting it.
23-11-2019T16:15:38,Channelfiction,could be
23-11-2019T16:15:45,BadFoMo,That too.

23-11-2019T16:16:16,BadFoMo,"Actually, it's looking more like that now."
23-11-2019T16:16:18,TeapotOfDoom,o/ w0lf!
23-11-2019T16:16:20,PalmettoPathfinder1,"If that is her toppling that tower, then ouch!  That's going to cause some major back problems."
23-11-2019T16:16:34,Channelfiction,Lift with your legs

23-11-2019T16:18:25,TheFreindlyDeathclaw,Hi Plems
23-11-2019T16:18:26,jirka,Hi W0lf
23-11-2019T16:18:38,ElvenHunter84,I'm glad Tom is picking a lot of the sketches that have been in circulation for a while
23-11-2019T16:18:39,ThingsAreMoving,I think Tom self published the comics.
23-11-2019T16:18:46,HiddenWorlds225,he does.
23-11-2019T16:18:53,ElvenHunter84,Kinda makes me regret switching my suggestions now
23-11-2019T16:18:56,Greendyes,petty sure it was always done by keenspot tbh
23-11-2019T16:18:56,Raitera,that's cool
23-11-2019T16:19:04,Glassan,"King Adelaide, you see an enemy tower. It is sealed and you need to breach it. What do you do?"
23-11-2019T16:19:07,HiddenWorlds225,it was always done on keenspot
23-11-2019T16:19:11,Raitera,and i like the delay on the stream
23-11-2019T16:19:13,Glassan,Adelaide: YEET!
23-11-2019T16:19:14,HiddenWorlds225,as far as i remember
23-11-2019T16:19:18,Raitera,hiya stranger drawin! :)
23-11-2019T16:19:49,ProsePro7,Well Adelaide that's what you get for eating too much bran
23-11-2019T16:20:14,HiddenWorlds225,Or she could've just woken up
23-11-2019T16:20:20,TeapotOfDoom,Do a strength check!
23-11-2019T16:20:27,Raitera,roll a nat 1
23-11-2019T16:20:37,BadFoMo,Why is the idea of the King lifting the tower reminding me of the endding of the 'Ed Edd 'n' Eddy' episode '1 + 1 = Ed' where Ed tried to pick up the hole and ended up picking up the whole sewer entrence?
23-11-2019T16:20:38,TeapotOfDoom,[Natural 20]*:ctwokinds-kingtea:
23-11-2019T16:20:47,HiddenWorlds225,obviously
23-11-2019T16:20:48,ThingsAreMoving,In basitin Mekkan strength does Adelaide check.
23-11-2019T16:20:51,Raitera,they did it too well that they failed lol
23-11-2019T16:21:17,ElvenHunter84,Did the tower punch her in the face a few times?
23-11-2019T16:21:24,TeapotOfDoom,lol things
23-11-2019T16:21:27,HiddenWorlds225,Did the tower gain sentience?
23-11-2019T16:21:45,ElvenHunter84,idk if this is the tower sketch anymore
23-11-2019T16:21:47,TheFreindlyDeathclaw,was this a wild dare?
23-11-2019T16:21:48,Greendyes,hm haven't heard this song in a looong time
23-11-2019T16:21:49,ThingsAreMoving,Might not be the tower suggestion. It was just a guess
23-11-2019T16:22:04,TeapotOfDoom,noone knows what adelaide's true strength does to things so maybe
23-11-2019T16:22:13,Raitera,for a sec i thought i heard undertale
23-11-2019T16:22:15,ElvenHunter84,Is this an alternate reality where Cathleen fights off Alabaster?
23-11-2019T16:22:17,Glassan,What else would earn that kind of face from the King?
23-11-2019T16:22:19,HiddenWorlds225,Still be cool to see her lift a tower
23-11-2019T16:22:38,HiddenWorlds225,just yeets it off the mountain
23-11-2019T16:22:39,InTheLionsDen,Perhaps it is the aftermath when Maddie's father was leaving the next morning.
23-11-2019T16:22:40,TeapotOfDoom,Normal person: flips table
23-11-2019T16:22:45,ThingsAreMoving,Things doesn't even want to know what Adelaide's true strength would do to him. :ctwokinds-keith8D:
23-11-2019T16:22:48,TeapotOfDoom,Adelaide: flips tower
23-11-2019T16:23:05,HiddenWorlds225,.-.
23-11-2019T16:23:07,146Time,I hope adult karen comes up today
23-11-2019T16:23:24,HiddenWorlds225,I wish i had $$$ so i can suggest
23-11-2019T16:23:25,CatzArt,ooh its basitain time
23-11-2019T16:23:35,TheFreindlyDeathclaw,Adelaide: picks up a second tower in her right hand and starts juggling the 2 towers
23-11-2019T16:23:46,HiddenWorlds225,add another one
23-11-2019T16:24:17,HiddenWorlds225,how many do you think she can lift at once?
23-11-2019T16:24:30,TeapotOfDoom,over 90000
23-11-2019T16:24:39,HiddenWorlds225,accurate answer
23-11-2019T16:24:44,ThingsAreMoving,Three. Two with her hands and one with her tail
23-11-2019T16:25:01,HiddenWorlds225,but you are forgetting her ability to stack them.
23-11-2019T16:25:11,Greendyes,And her teeth lol
23-11-2019T16:25:14,TheFreindlyDeathclaw,Now I wanna see a request of Adelaide juggling 3 towers
23-11-2019T16:25:17,146Time,"oh, looks like the towers are fighting back"
23-11-2019T16:25:26,SageSaga,yo
23-11-2019T16:25:29,BadFoMo,Yo.
23-11-2019T16:25:29,ThingsAreMoving,o/ Sage
23-11-2019T16:25:33,HiddenWorlds225,eey
23-11-2019T16:25:35,Greendyes,heya sage
23-11-2019T16:25:42,AnuSekaniArt,Allo Sage!
23-11-2019T16:25:44,PalmettoPathfinder1,This was probably a Western vs Eastern Basitin battle.
23-11-2019T16:25:46,TeapotOfDoom,yo sage o/
23-11-2019T16:26:12,146Time,the... western? basitins feel more like blowgun and spear folks
23-11-2019T16:26:45,HiddenWorlds225,You wouldn't really know until you live with them for a while.
23-11-2019T16:27:00,HiddenWorlds225,Probs ask Laura
23-11-2019T16:27:01,Greendyes,watch them be the first specird to pull up a cannon
23-11-2019T16:27:56,BadFoMo,"That arrow reminded me of Scarface. Adelaide: I'll take your ****ing arrows! ...My brain is weird (but that was already known, wasn't it?)."
23-11-2019T16:28:23,Greendyes,atleast it isn't in the knee
23-11-2019T16:28:56,Glassan,The arrows are probably too scared of her knees to ruin her adventuring days.
23-11-2019T16:29:02,ThingsAreMoving,"Btw, not sure if it was intended or not, but human Reni's eye spacing gives her face a reptile'y feel, and that's awesome."
23-11-2019T16:29:50,Twokinds,I did actually try to make Reni's eyes look a little strange
23-11-2019T16:30:00,Twokinds,Just slightly off
23-11-2019T16:30:05,HiddenWorlds225,She looks fine to me.
23-11-2019T16:30:30,BadFoMo,I didn't see that. I'll have to look again after this.
23-11-2019T16:30:36,ProsePro7,I'm sure Flora likes her finally someone flatter than her\
23-11-2019T16:30:38,TeapotOfDoom,brb i'm arriving. gonna go home and come back
23-11-2019T16:30:44,Glassan,All those 'slightly off' touches were excellent. It really fit well.
23-11-2019T16:31:06,ProsePro7,Reni cute in a very thin tomboy way
23-11-2019T16:31:14,BadFoMo,"@ProsePro7 Well, Reni's a gonner."
23-11-2019T16:31:44,HiddenWorlds225,At least we get to see the tower being flipped
23-11-2019T16:31:48,ThingsAreMoving,"Did we get any lore regarding that butterfly, that seems to always be with her, though? :ctwokinds-floraquestion:"
23-11-2019T16:31:52,PalmettoPathfinder1,I know what Eric's Christmas wish is: all of the TK girls giftwrapped for him (with no clothes on of course).  Naughty naughty Eric.  ;)
23-11-2019T16:32:11,Greendyes,ready to paint
23-11-2019T16:32:15,Greendyes,hehe
23-11-2019T16:32:17,ProsePro7,@ThingsAreMoving I think its a Spyro reference
23-11-2019T16:32:21,ElvenHunter84,I think it's just symbolic of her design
23-11-2019T16:32:27,ElvenHunter84,Her design is based on a Monarch Butterfly
23-11-2019T16:32:39,TerraTheWizard,monarch butterfly -> princess reni
23-11-2019T16:32:49,TerraTheWizard,*sparkly crown*

23-11-2019T16:34:13,InTheLionsDen,The ones in the tower probably don't think so.
23-11-2019T16:34:35,ThingsAreMoving,"Adelaide, the ultimate siege unit."
23-11-2019T16:34:40,ElvenHunter84,This feat must have been very critical in her becoming King
23-11-2019T16:34:56,JuniperSkunktaur,"@twokinds Tom, you're amazing... thanks so much for the tutorial stuff I found on your DA recently, it's helping my own art a lot :)"
23-11-2019T16:35:04,InTheLionsDen,They shouldn't have taunted her.
23-11-2019T16:35:04,ElvenHunter84,since Basitins decide their king by the strongest amongst  them
23-11-2019T16:35:13,HiddenWorlds225,"""I wonder what happens if I yeet this tower..."" *Becomes king*"
23-11-2019T16:35:21,ProsePro7,I hate when the stream is glitchy the sound is so annoying!

23-11-2019T16:46:15,CrRAR,They built a tower obstructing her pleasant view of the valley beyond; she obstructed their ability to continue existing.
23-11-2019T16:46:41,ThingsAreMoving,there are two same suggestions with Maren having a nightmare. Just slightly differently worded
23-11-2019T16:46:43,ElvenHunter84,I really like the concept of Brutus protecting Clovis
23-11-2019T16:47:15,ElvenHunter84,but I would love to see some Beastars fanart too
23-11-2019T16:48:13,BadFoMo,@ThingsAreMoving I was about to point that out too.

23-11-2019T18:53:55,Shierna,Depends on who she's outing.
23-11-2019T18:54:07,ThingsAreMoving,I just need to figure out what verbal noun would suit that suggestion
23-11-2019T18:54:27,Twokinds,Honestly I was nervous
23-11-2019T18:54:32,TeapotOfDoom,why?
23-11-2019T18:54:45,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
23-11-2019T18:54:46,Twokinds,Wasn't sure how people would take her human form
23-11-2019T18:54:47,vevans0009,We used to seeing anime dragon girls.
23-11-2019T18:54:58,TeapotOfDoom,i guess people took her quite well

23-11-2019T18:55:06,unsteddyphoenix,I love her design its so good
23-11-2019T18:55:07,IronHorseComics,particularly her lack of...um... male magnets
23-11-2019T18:55:07,BadFoMo,"@Shierna The King flipping a tower, Maren dreaming of her getting hitched to Sythe, and Nora popping out of Tom's tablet."
23-11-2019T18:55:08,TeapotOfDoom,indeed

23-11-2019T18:55:32,TeapotOfDoom,her human form is spot on
23-11-2019T18:55:41,Shierna,HumanReni is the model of shapeshiting perfection.
23-11-2019T18:55:46,RimaDraws,i am in so much pain i could puke

23-11-2019T18:56:49,TeapotOfDoom,put it in cold water and use that
23-11-2019T18:56:50,Shierna,What happened?
23-11-2019T18:56:52,ProsePro7,She looks kind of like an Elfling
23-11-2019T18:56:58,RimaDraws,i pulled my shoulder
23-11-2019T18:56:58,146Time,Girls with dragon limbs are A+
23-11-2019T18:57:00,vevans0009,Adrakist might be upset seeing Reni like that.

23-11-2019T18:57:42,Shierna,"Cold won't do much now, then."
23-11-2019T18:57:46,ShamusTheFox,Now there's an image. The Adrakist being rude to human Reni without realizing who it really is underneath.
23-11-2019T18:57:58,ThingsAreMoving,cold helps numb the area
23-11-2019T18:58:05,ThingsAreMoving,untill the painkillers set in
23-11-2019T18:58:10,vevans0009,I think she is smart enough to tell thats Reni. x3
23-11-2019T18:58:23,Shierna,Ibuprofen for pain and inflamation.
23-11-2019T18:58:26,Ordithus,Sarah would freak out
23-11-2019T18:58:31,iliar,Too big boobs is also bad. I think Nora could conduct experiments to find out what size makes the maximum impression.

23-11-2019T19:00:29,TeapotOfDoom,also tom i would still have loved just a straightup dragon in a bikini like karen thought. that would have been hillarious xD
23-11-2019T19:00:36,Shierna,"Rima, a sling under the elbow to take the strain off may help."
23-11-2019T19:00:38,vevans0009,Also cute

23-11-2019T19:02:50,Twokinds,She's a black dragon
23-11-2019T19:02:52,ThingsAreMoving,"I remember Tom saying she's destined for evil, since she's black."

23-11-2019T19:03:52,iliar,And speaking of big breasts. After reading the page. Reni overhears that Keiren loves big breasts and is trying to increase her. But he is mistaken with the size and cannot stand on two legs.
23-11-2019T19:03:52,TeapotOfDoom,Not possible I say

23-11-2019T20:37:34,ShamusTheFox,"Does Reni have crippling self-esteem issues? I mean, I know she is socially awkward, but is it more than an endearing character trait?"

23-11-2019T22:01:59,AspiringNoodle,"I have the 3700X and 2070 super, and spent waaaaaaaaay more on arguably too much :P"
23-11-2019T22:02:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,me and my 970 under race
23-11-2019T22:02:23,Ordithus,Nice thing is pretty much any decent modern system is gonna be pretty kick ass
23-11-2019T22:02:42,AspiringNoodle,"Yup, now I need to do stuff besides gaming to justify my purchases xD"
23-11-2019T22:02:48,HoverdudeXL,hello
23-11-2019T22:02:56,Ordithus,o/ Hover
23-11-2019T22:03:24,AspiringNoodle,"Also, consumer builds are slowly starting to erase the meaning behind purpose built stuff"
23-11-2019T22:03:37,AspiringNoodle,"Now any decent computer can do gaming, streaming, or professional workloads"
23-11-2019T22:03:44,Ordithus,"Heck, my laptop is almost as powerful as my desktop"
23-11-2019T22:04:03,AspiringNoodle,"And I would like to thank AMD for helping to advance the cause, lol"
23-11-2019T22:04:18,AspiringNoodle,"Thanks to them, mainstream systems are getting more cores and threads than ever"
23-11-2019T22:04:43,AspiringNoodle,And now you can get a powerful CPU for gaming / streaming / professional work for $500 or less
23-11-2019T22:05:11,Dadrobit,I considered a 5700XT but pretty much every variant tends to be loud and draw tons of power and heat. There are some 2070S out there that are much more quiet and I'm looking to make this as silent as possible.
23-11-2019T22:05:26,AspiringNoodle,My recommendation?
23-11-2019T22:05:30,AspiringNoodle,Gigabyte Gaming OC
23-11-2019T22:05:44,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Ord I wish I can say the same about my laptop.  If I have youtube and a stream on.  It has a heart attack and locks up.  :I
23-11-2019T22:05:47,Dadrobit,"Yep, that was one of the ones I was looking at"
23-11-2019T22:05:53,AspiringNoodle,"2.5 slot card, triple fans.  I can never hear the fans with the default profile, and it has not breached 70C once"
23-11-2019T22:07:06,Dadrobit,Looking to put it in a be quiet! Pure Base 600. I love the idea of adjustable airflow/noise. And it's not unreasonably expensive.
23-11-2019T22:07:33,AspiringNoodle,I went with cooler master's H500M
23-11-2019T22:07:43,AspiringNoodle,This thing is so quiet <3
23-11-2019T22:08:49,Dadrobit,"Marv, just noticed your Profile Pic has been holiday-ified. Love it!"
23-11-2019T22:09:53,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:cmarvthehugpharaoh-ezgifcom-crop: Thanks bb
23-11-2019T22:10:35,Ordithus,ack cute
23-11-2019T22:11:51,Sclimshady,Kis is adorable :ptv-scilove:
23-11-2019T22:11:52,AspiringNoodle,"Dad, when you finally build, let me know what your idle temps are"
23-11-2019T22:12:04,MarvTheHugPharaoh,You're adorable
23-11-2019T22:12:14,Sclimshady,Thanks bb
23-11-2019T22:12:22,AspiringNoodle,My 3700X idles ~36 - 38C with spikes to 43C.  I'm using a 360 AIO and it's driving me nuts wondering if I did it wrong
23-11-2019T22:12:25,Ordithus,"Marv, my desktop is half 2011 half 2017, my laptop is brand spanking new and more $$"
23-11-2019T22:12:31,Dadrobit,It's primarily actually going to be a workstation. I do a fair bit of audio editing and I'm moving into video production as well for some side money. My aforementioned combo just seemed to be the right fit for quality of life without
23-11-2019T22:12:35,Dadrobit,breaking the bank
23-11-2019T22:12:53,Ordithus,The laptop gets way more use
23-11-2019T22:13:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,My desk top is half 2014 and 2018
23-11-2019T22:13:30,MarvTheHugPharaoh,my laptop is from target
23-11-2019T22:13:35,AspiringNoodle,My desktop is pure 2019~
23-11-2019T22:13:56,Ordithus,Getting the refurb laptop was a good decision
23-11-2019T22:14:18,AspiringNoodle,"Ord, did you hear about the new laptop Lenovo released?"
23-11-2019T22:14:25,Ordithus,Nope
23-11-2019T22:14:29,Sclimshady,My desktop is 90% 2016 and the graphics is 2018 1060
23-11-2019T22:14:33,Ordithus,I don't follow computer news
23-11-2019T22:14:42,AspiringNoodle,It's an AMD variant of one of their touch screens
23-11-2019T22:14:57,Dadrobit,"Refurbs can be great, Personally I've had to RMA every refurb I've ever gotten, but EVENTUALLY when I don't get set a lemon they're great lol."
23-11-2019T22:15:06,Dadrobit,sent*
23-11-2019T22:15:10,AspiringNoodle,"It's cheaper than the Intel version, has 2GB more usable RAM, AND performs spectacularly :)"
23-11-2019T22:15:20,Ordithus,I do need to fix the headphone jack on this one
23-11-2019T22:15:32,Ordithus,"Not worth the RMA process, a usb dongle works fine"
23-11-2019T22:16:02,MarvTheHugPharaoh,A friend of mine buys a lot of refurbed stuff.  He got a wacom 13in for like 500.
23-11-2019T22:16:03,AspiringNoodle,I RMA'd my monitor earlier this year.  Was worth it :)
23-11-2019T22:17:06,Ordithus,"The headphone jack being left only is the one, single issue.  I can also probably fix it super easy... probably"
23-11-2019T22:18:02,Dadrobit,"Last laptop I got (after it was replaced) has been great. i7 7700, 16 gigs of RAM, and a 1050. Was like $600."
23-11-2019T22:18:43,Dadrobit,Performs better than my desktop in a lot of ways it feels.
23-11-2019T22:18:47,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Thats a awesome deal
23-11-2019T22:18:59,Ordithus,Nice
23-11-2019T22:19:00,AspiringNoodle,Indeed
23-11-2019T22:19:12,AspiringNoodle,"Like, holy.  Them specs"
23-11-2019T22:19:20,Dadrobit,Only bugbear is the screen. Working with 12.5 inches is.... Trying at times.
23-11-2019T22:19:41,Ordithus,"That's what the desktop is for, or at least a second monitor"
23-11-2019T22:20:18,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I've had half a mind to just yank my monitor over to where I keep the laptop and work off the ""second"" screen as my primary."
23-11-2019T22:21:57,Dadrobit,"For anyone looking, the laptop was a Newegg Black Friday/ Cyber Monday deal, so similar options will be available soon."
23-11-2019T22:22:19,Dadrobit,It was oddly kind of buried though. I had to sort through a lot of crap deals before I saw it.
23-11-2019T22:24:54,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Anyone have any experience with surface pros?
23-11-2019T22:25:48,Dadrobit,":( Can't say I have any personal experiences, just watched a few reviews of em."
23-11-2019T22:25:55,Glassan,I do.
23-11-2019T22:26:04,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Any good, glass?"
23-11-2019T22:26:23,Glassan,"They're pretty solid devices, if a bit on the pricey side."
23-11-2019T22:26:33,Ordithus,I have a pro 4
23-11-2019T22:26:42,Glassan,"I've had varients of them since 2012, and currently have the Pro 5"
23-11-2019T22:26:45,Ordithus,The screen went to crap after a bit over 3 years
23-11-2019T22:26:55,Ordithus,Otherwise it was great
23-11-2019T22:27:02,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Cool
23-11-2019T22:27:26,Ordithus,As far as I know it is a problem specific to the pro 4
23-11-2019T22:27:41,Glassan,"Only issues I can site, are, if the screen gets cracked/damaged, the digitizer is at risk of failing, but that was with the Pro 3"
23-11-2019T22:27:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I'm looking at the 6s right now
23-11-2019T22:28:23,Glassan,"And the 5 got some occassional discoloration on the screen, but I tend to take mine into extreme cold and heat, so that is somewhat expected of LCDs"
23-11-2019T22:28:50,Glassan,"The discoloration resolved itself after a while, so it is kind of a non issue."
23-11-2019T22:29:03,Ordithus,The 4 has a screen flicker/shake
23-11-2019T22:29:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Mines just gonna be eithe by my bed or in a backpack.  Nothing extreme .
23-11-2019T22:29:38,Glassan,"Performance-wise, they are pretty strong. And the 5 and 6, if you get the i5 variants, are virtually silent as they are wholly passive cooled."
23-11-2019T22:29:42,Glassan,i.e. no fans.
23-11-2019T22:30:10,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Coolio.
23-11-2019T22:30:15,Ordithus,"I have an XPS 13 now, it's been rad so far"
23-11-2019T22:30:33,Glassan,"Also, the 5 and 6 no longer come with the surface pen, so if you were planning on writing-type stuff, that should also be a planned expense."
23-11-2019T22:31:08,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I saw that.  I already added that to the price
23-11-2019T22:31:24,Glassan,"tl;dr, The Surface Pro is the iPad with a windows desktop OS."
23-11-2019T22:31:40,Glassan,"Which, for me, was a VERY important factor."
23-11-2019T22:31:53,Ordithus,"As a warning, unless it has been changed, the surface pen does NOT have tilt or whatever"
23-11-2019T22:31:59,Ordithus,The angle of the pen does not matter
23-11-2019T22:32:04,Glassan,It also helped that I had some variant of voucher from either my college or the U.S Government for them. :P
23-11-2019T22:32:10,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Tilt was added
23-11-2019T22:32:18,Ordithus,"OK, cool!"
23-11-2019T22:32:25,Glassan,"Tilt was added, but only to the newer pen models"
23-11-2019T22:32:27,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Got to try it in best buy a few days ago
23-11-2019T22:32:36,Glassan,You can tell if it is a tilt model by looking at the tip.
23-11-2019T22:33:11,Glassan,"If the tip looks like a full plastic sleeve, it's the tilt enabled kind. If it is a small plastic ring, it is the older version 3 pen."
23-11-2019T22:34:07,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Welp as for now I'm sold.  Thanks bbs
23-11-2019T22:34:13,Glassan,"Nowadays, you would generally have to actively search for the old versions. Best buy and other general retailers don't carry them anymore since the new ones are backwards compatible."
23-11-2019T22:34:16,AspiringNoodle,I swore to myself that I wouldn't buy a new tablet (wacom / etc.) until I wore through all the nibs
23-11-2019T22:34:18,Glassan,"NP, Marv."
23-11-2019T22:34:27,AspiringNoodle,I want to be sure that I'm serious before I invest that kind of money :)
23-11-2019T22:34:48,Sclimshady,"Aww, Marv is sold?  I was gonna place a bid"
23-11-2019T22:34:51,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Noodle this is a laptop replacement first, portable tablet second"
23-11-2019T22:35:08,AspiringNoodle,I don't have a laptop ;)
23-11-2019T22:35:08,Glassan,It's pretty darn good for that.
23-11-2019T22:35:14,AspiringNoodle,"So it'd be both, lol"
23-11-2019T22:35:15,Sclimshady,Xp pen Deco is like 50 and pretty good to start
23-11-2019T22:35:27,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Yes shady, I got sold and box'd up headed to either Arizona or New Zeland"
23-11-2019T22:35:45,Ordithus,Why not MN?
23-11-2019T22:35:54,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Could be going there
23-11-2019T22:36:01,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I can't see much out the air holes
23-11-2019T22:36:04,Dadrobit,"Man, the automatick displacement of ""older"" tech is ridiculous. I broke my screen protector on my Note 9 the other day. Brought it in for a free replacement at my phone shop. ""Sorry, we don't carry Note 9's or anything related to them anymore after 10""."
23-11-2019T22:36:06,Ordithus,We have snow
23-11-2019T22:36:11,MarvTheHugPharaoh,On my way
23-11-2019T22:36:12,Sclimshady,"Fair,  you wouldnt be happy in CA.  I need to think about your welfare"
23-11-2019T22:36:12,Dadrobit,automatic
23-11-2019T22:36:29,Glassan,"I hear you there, Dadro."
23-11-2019T22:36:29,Ordithus,Last forecast I saw for the coming weekend is a full foot of it
23-11-2019T22:36:39,Sclimshady,Whos foot though?
23-11-2019T22:36:46,Glassan,Foot? of snow?
23-11-2019T22:36:52,Ordithus,"Yeah, snow"
23-11-2019T22:36:55,Glassan,8D
23-11-2019T22:37:01,Glassan,I wish I had that!
23-11-2019T22:37:05,Glassan,I miss snow.
23-11-2019T22:37:16,Dadrobit,We.... We had rain?
23-11-2019T22:37:29,Dadrobit,"For like 3 days actually, it was really really nice."
23-11-2019T22:37:38,Glassan,"Bah, rain is just worse, wet snow. >:|"
23-11-2019T22:37:54,Glassan,runs off to the mountians to hermit
23-11-2019T22:38:30,Glassan,"Whereabouts are you, where you're getting rain, Dadro?"
23-11-2019T22:39:34,Dadrobit,Arizona
23-11-2019T22:39:45,Glassan,"Ah, well, that's fair then."
23-11-2019T22:39:53,Dadrobit,lol
23-11-2019T22:40:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hows it feel to be hydrated dad?
23-11-2019T22:40:24,Ordithus,I love visiting AZ
23-11-2019T22:40:33,Dadrobit,"""Who the Hell likes rain?!?!"" ""Oh him? He's from Az."" ""Ohhhhh, that makes sense then."""
23-11-2019T22:40:55,AspiringNoodle,My state gets lots o' weather
23-11-2019T22:41:00,Glassan,Arizona can't handle snow. :P
23-11-2019T22:41:01,AspiringNoodle,I like the bad kind :ptv-hearts:
23-11-2019T22:41:02,Dadrobit,"It feels pleasantly moist, Marv."
23-11-2019T22:41:16,Ordithus,"AZ gets plenty of snow in the mountains, like Flagstaff"
23-11-2019T22:41:17,AspiringNoodle,I live in a state that can get all 4 seasons in 1 week :)
23-11-2019T22:41:29,Glassan,Colorado?
23-11-2019T22:41:33,AspiringNoodle,"Nope, lol"
23-11-2019T22:41:36,Glassan,Or Minnesota?
23-11-2019T22:41:39,AspiringNoodle,Nope
23-11-2019T22:41:51,Dadrobit,"Yeah, AZ has a ton of high country with a bunch of snow. Just that 97% of our population lives in Phoenix."
23-11-2019T22:42:00,Glassan,xD
23-11-2019T22:42:13,Glassan,High country is the best country though.
23-11-2019T22:42:23,AspiringNoodle,*puts down joint*
23-11-2019T22:42:25,AspiringNoodle,Right on!
23-11-2019T22:42:37,AspiringNoodle,"Oh wait... different kind of high, right?"
23-11-2019T22:42:43,AspiringNoodle,Carry on :ptv-uneasy:
23-11-2019T22:42:44,Glassan,>_o
23-11-2019T22:43:00,Glassan,"I came from Colorado, I get it."
23-11-2019T22:43:32,Dadrobit,We're working on that part too.
23-11-2019T22:43:50,AspiringNoodle,Things I want to see in the future
23-11-2019T22:44:06,Glassan,"For all the fearmongering I had seen, economically it worked out pretty well for CO."
23-11-2019T22:44:11,Dadrobit,It's legal and anyone can get a card for anything. But there's still a huge stigma.
23-11-2019T22:44:12,AspiringNoodle,"UBI, decriminalization of pot across the board, Flora's baby"
23-11-2019T22:44:30,Dadrobit,And then there's Biden.... >.>
23-11-2019T22:44:34,Glassan,They've had state tax surpluses for I think 7 of the last 10 years.
23-11-2019T22:44:56,AspiringNoodle,Problem with our government:  they love spending
23-11-2019T22:45:00,Dadrobit,My job won't even let me use CBD products. It's fukkin ridiculous.
23-11-2019T22:45:06,Glassan,Same with mine.
23-11-2019T22:45:12,AspiringNoodle,"They will increase spending, then do everything in their power to make it as hard as possible to reduce spending"
23-11-2019T22:45:35,Glassan,*shrug
23-11-2019T22:45:53,AspiringNoodle,I would LOVE UBI to be implemented
23-11-2019T22:46:43,Dadrobit,#YangGang
23-11-2019T22:46:55,Dadrobit,Can't wait for Thanksgiving
23-11-2019T22:47:17,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Time to gain about 400 extra pounds
23-11-2019T22:47:18,Glassan,Hooray for lotsa good food.
23-11-2019T22:47:22,Ordithus,foooood
23-11-2019T22:47:27,Glassan,yum
23-11-2019T22:47:40,Ordithus,politics never comes up at my family thanksgiving
23-11-2019T22:47:42,Ordithus,thankfully
23-11-2019T22:47:53,AspiringNoodle,I work on Thanksgiving :D
23-11-2019T22:47:57,AspiringNoodle,#YayRetail
23-11-2019T22:48:03,Glassan,Me too!
23-11-2019T22:48:11,AspiringNoodle,#DEATHTORETAIL
23-11-2019T22:48:12,Sclimshady,Its all my family talks about Ord
23-11-2019T22:48:14,Glassan,"and Noodle, working bros"
23-11-2019T22:48:26,Dadrobit,I work Thanksgiving as well. My family is celebrating on Wednesday for scheduling with other people.
23-11-2019T22:48:37,Dadrobit,I still work Wednesday as well tho
23-11-2019T22:48:56,Glassan,It sounds like a pretty good workaround though.
23-11-2019T22:49:11,AspiringNoodle,I'm tired of working at the gas station
23-11-2019T22:49:18,AspiringNoodle,Too much stuff goes wrong on a regular basis >_>
23-11-2019T22:49:33,Dadrobit,I have good debates with some of my family. My little brother and grandaddy in particular I'll chat and argue with them over politics for hours.
23-11-2019T22:49:37,Glassan,"Hate to say it, but most jobs are secretly like that. -_-"
23-11-2019T22:50:24,Glassan,"And Dadro, as long as everyone can still sit down and not hate each other before the end of the night, that sounds like great fun."
23-11-2019T22:50:27,Ordithus,"My sister and I are the odd ""liberals"" in the family and get teased over that... and yet I never get a response when I ask what's wrong with that"
23-11-2019T22:50:36,Dadrobit,Then there's my step brother's father in law. Dude's fucking dumb as a brick and a hardline party voter who doesn't know the meaning of civil debate.
23-11-2019T22:51:19,AspiringNoodle,I don't mind actual liberals
23-11-2019T22:51:29,AspiringNoodle,"I hate the ""liberals"" who have hijacked the party :/"
23-11-2019T22:51:51,Dadrobit,"Because, Ord. Anyone who claims even a bit that they're liberal, the opposing people automatically go to the extremes of hyper unregulated capitalism and pedophilia."
23-11-2019T22:52:11,AspiringNoodle,"And given how the media has devolved over the past 30 years or so, we REALLY need to investigate some of the protections / immunities they get"
23-11-2019T22:52:12,Sclimshady,"Im libertarian,  which basically makes me liberal to my family"
23-11-2019T22:52:24,AspiringNoodle,Because they get away with so much shit that they should be getting fined into oblivion / jailed for
23-11-2019T22:52:26,SpazztasticKiwi,I got distracted then forgot about the whole stream

23-11-2019T22:55:55,Glassan,Also spiders.
23-11-2019T22:55:55,Sclimshady,"Give a man a fire, he'll be warm for a day.  Light him on fire he'll be warm for the rest of his life"
23-11-2019T22:56:14,Glassan,"I had to force myself NOT to say that, Sclim"

23-11-2019T23:09:54,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Because we need some things that are sacred on this planet
23-11-2019T23:10:08,SpazztasticKiwi,tsk tsk
23-11-2019T23:10:20,SpazztasticKiwi,so naive
23-11-2019T23:10:29,Ordithus,The planet is lewd
23-11-2019T23:10:39,SpazztasticKiwi,the secret is to not say it’s sacred
23-11-2019T23:11:11,Sclimshady,Someone has indeed lewded Earth
23-11-2019T23:11:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Earth chan ;-;
23-11-2019T23:12:12,Sclimshady,"Like, c'mon.  Thats my mother"
23-11-2019T23:13:17,Dadrobit,Ya know what I feel? I feel like making a cherry cobbler.
23-11-2019T23:16:00,Sclimshady,You best be making it in a dutch oven
23-11-2019T23:17:29,Dadrobit,I have a ceramic equivalent
23-11-2019T23:18:33,Dadrobit,"I'd of course prefer a cast iron pot to do over a fire, but alas."
23-11-2019T23:21:26,MarvTheHugPharaoh,That was a very cozy image that put in my head dad
23-11-2019T23:22:19,Sclimshady,"Man,  I should get around to building my firepit for next summer"
23-11-2019T23:23:11,SpazztasticKiwi,kitty being viscous
23-11-2019T23:23:24,SpazztasticKiwi,everyone run for your lives
23-11-2019T23:24:34,Dadrobit,"Back when I was in the Boy Scouts, my troop was RENOWN for our dutch oven deserts that we'd make for the various events we attended."
23-11-2019T23:25:07,Dadrobit,"T'was a long time ago, but it's a find memory seeing absurdly long lines for our food from all the other troops."
23-11-2019T23:25:11,Dadrobit,fond*
23-11-2019T23:25:20,Sclimshady,"Yes,  scout brother"
23-11-2019T23:25:49,Sclimshady,we were known for making full desserts and such in the craziest places
23-11-2019T23:26:04,Sclimshady,Made an actual cake in the middle of the sierras
23-11-2019T23:26:17,Sclimshady,And cheesecake in the colorado river
23-11-2019T23:27:54,Dadrobit,:( I went searching and it looks like my old troop might have disbanded some time after I left...
23-11-2019T23:28:23,Sclimshady,"Aww,  you were the glue holding them together"
23-11-2019T23:28:56,Dadrobit,"Made it to Life, then I broke my back and really couldn't continue after that."
23-11-2019T23:30:30,Sclimshady,"Yeah,  that would do it"
23-11-2019T23:31:01,Dadrobit,It was kinda sorta falling apart when I left compared to when I started. Old scout masters left right before I did and the remainder weren't nearly as commanding. Left a lot of the younger scouts doing nothing on their phones while the older ones tried
23-11-2019T23:31:06,Dadrobit,keeping things organized.
23-11-2019T23:32:41,Dadrobit,"Old scout masters were all military or ex-military. Ran the troop like a proper troop. Newer guys, they tried making it a religious thing, didn't sit well with a lot of us."
23-11-2019T23:34:42,JojoF2415,My first digital art took way too long to make
23-11-2019T23:35:06,Dadrobit,I really wasn't happy about it in particular. I liked the more regimented aspect of it. Was aspiring to join the Air Force out of high school. New guys wanted to turn us into missionaries instead.
23-11-2019T23:36:56,AspiringNoodle,First rule of people not minding your religion: Don't push it onto others
23-11-2019T23:37:14,AspiringNoodle,"That's the best and fastest way to make them not like not only you, but your entire religion ;)"
23-11-2019T23:40:14,Sclimshady,"Our scoutmaster was a deacon, and he never went overboard like that.  He was great"
23-11-2019T23:46:23,AspiringNoodle,"Agnosticism is the cool new religion"" c:"
