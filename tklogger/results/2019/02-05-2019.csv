02-05-2019T20:10:06,LannAF,also
02-05-2019T20:10:07,LannAF,Huh
02-05-2019T20:10:20,LannAF,"I was about to say ""Wouldn't non-lethal be more appropriately termed less than lethal?"""
02-05-2019T20:10:26,LannAF,but..That seems pretty nonlethal
02-05-2019T20:10:42,InTheLionsDen,Not usually lethal.
02-05-2019T20:10:46,Sclimshady,Pointy hooks in the legs is still no fun
02-05-2019T20:10:49,Ordithus,Wait till you find out what happens when it gets in your soup
02-05-2019T20:10:54,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Its a ballistic hug gun
02-05-2019T20:11:11,LannAF,"Well most ""non-lethal"" weapons are termed Less than Lethal"
02-05-2019T20:11:18,LannAF,Because they can still kill fairly easy
02-05-2019T20:11:34,Bgrmystr2,"wraps around your neck, see how quick it's non-lethal lol"
02-05-2019T20:11:39,Sclimshady,lol
02-05-2019T20:11:44,LannAF,It doesn't look like it constricts that badly
02-05-2019T20:11:51,LannAF,At most it's probably..Collapse your windpipe?
02-05-2019T20:11:52,Bgrmystr2,"naw it doesn't, you're right"
02-05-2019T20:12:06,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-KatDance:
02-05-2019T20:12:19,IronHorseComics,"looks more like it would be ineffective, these guys are able to still relatively walk"

02-05-2019T20:12:28,LannAF,Did you keep watching?

02-05-2019T20:12:35,LannAF,"Also, slightly walking is different than running"
02-05-2019T20:12:52,qwe304,whats on the table today?
02-05-2019T20:12:52,LannAF,Walking during a police chase would make it a very short venture
02-05-2019T20:12:56,qwe304,comic page?
02-05-2019T20:12:59,SageSaga,just binding the arms and legs at the same time is a big advantage
02-05-2019T20:13:02,LannAF,^
02-05-2019T20:13:08,LannAF,Arms being bound alone is amazing

02-05-2019T20:13:34,SageSaga,now im not saying its gonna disarm people - clearly you jsut keep your arms up- BUT - imagine this -
02-05-2019T20:13:56,LannAF,"I mean, it still might disorient them enough to reduce accuracy"
02-05-2019T20:13:59,LannAF,I wouldn't take the chance
02-05-2019T20:14:14,Sclimshady,"of coures it wont disarm them, they still have arms"
02-05-2019T20:14:15,Zakuru,yay !
02-05-2019T20:14:15,LannAF,....Horrifying thought is getting shot in the head at the eyeball region
02-05-2019T20:14:18,LannAF,Bye eyes
02-05-2019T20:14:19,IronHorseComics,"I can see the potential, the thread just seems a bit too flexible"

02-05-2019T20:15:02,qwe304,thing with most less-than-lethals is that they are also less-than-reliable

02-05-2019T20:15:37,SageSaga,yeah but i prefer not being dead or not killing people who are innocent to killing them
02-05-2019T20:15:41,qwe304,what is it yall are taklking about than?
02-05-2019T20:15:46,LannAF,Less than lethal weapons!

02-05-2019T20:16:29,FlashThunderBang,why the weird three part scaren
02-05-2019T20:16:44,Ordithus,Because three streams
02-05-2019T20:16:45,Terramaster20209,Ohhh i know this song

02-05-2019T20:17:10,Ordithus,Ron those faces haha
02-05-2019T20:17:16,qwe304,@SageSaga did you notice how all the people in the vid are wearing thick clothing?
02-05-2019T20:17:41,qwe304,"probably to protect them, thin cord going fast can easily cut"
02-05-2019T20:17:45,TheSexyBeast,...thick?
02-05-2019T20:17:57,InTheLionsDen,Those thin binding would chafe on bare skin.
02-05-2019T20:18:00,Sclimshady,It has barbs at the end
02-05-2019T20:18:08,SageSaga,Qwe- yes- its a test
02-05-2019T20:18:36,qwe304,also kinda weird that they never show the actual device
02-05-2019T20:18:40,SageSaga,its probably not going to cut though - it doesnt travel that fast- it could bruise or pinch
02-05-2019T20:19:02,Corinthian,yo
02-05-2019T20:19:08,Ordithus,o/
02-05-2019T20:19:12,qwe304,im not sayin its gonna cut someones leg off but it could definitely still do some real damage
02-05-2019T20:19:33,SageSaga,"and im saying ""look! new technology that might mean less people dying!"""
02-05-2019T20:19:36,qwe304,also it loogs like it needs a chear firing area so that the cord can horizontally disperce properly
02-05-2019T20:19:40,qwe304,*clear
02-05-2019T20:19:58,Ordithus,It would be fun at parties
02-05-2019T20:20:03,qwe304,looks like a more situational tazer imo
02-05-2019T20:20:11,Supahbuzzer,coming up next: silverlock's obligatory training montage. -sigh- i'll get the music.... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMnTbFVVyec

02-05-2019T21:50:41,ContagiousBordem16,Dang raine dem legs though
02-05-2019T21:51:00,TheOtherEric,"Agreed, theres really no winning with stuff like coffee and soda. I've cut out soda and it helps a LOT"

02-05-2019T21:51:13,CrimsonHelsing,I just don't want to wake up one day to find Tom has cancer or something. that'd be a disaster
02-05-2019T21:51:35,ContagiousBordem16,Why would you think that
02-05-2019T21:51:45,AFallingTree,news like that would shatter my soul
02-05-2019T21:51:59,TheOtherEric,"Also, Raine peets!"

02-05-2019T21:52:04,Combak,Why did you bring that evil into this house?
02-05-2019T21:52:08,CrimsonHelsing,Aspartame has been known to cause stuff like that if consumed enough
02-05-2019T21:52:10,TheOtherEric,Tom is eternal
02-05-2019T21:52:36,CrimsonHelsing,that's why I don't believe in diet sodas or fake sugars. xP

02-05-2019T22:06:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Can anyone explain to me what the hell these boys are doing crawling on counters and trash cans in McDonald’s
02-05-2019T22:06:38,Mippy,My dad’s watching Baki the Grappler....
02-05-2019T22:06:39,Sclimshady,What are you going on about?
02-05-2019T22:06:40,Ordithus,"Nope, can't explain that"

02-05-2019T22:07:38,steelabjur,Are they little kids? That might explain it.
02-05-2019T22:07:42,SpazztasticKiwi,No
02-05-2019T22:07:55,SpazztasticKiwi,They’re only a few years behind me
02-05-2019T22:08:01,Sclimshady,Drugs maybe?
02-05-2019T22:08:40,steelabjur,Most likely a visit from Drugs Bunny. :p
02-05-2019T22:08:53,Sclimshady,:rabbit:
02-05-2019T22:10:10,SageSaga,there's a scene where Baki is in bed with his girlfriend- and his Dad shows up to encourage them to have sex
02-05-2019T22:10:16,Nekonny,sorry if I'm working on video instead of drawing
02-05-2019T22:10:20,Combak,The heck?
02-05-2019T22:10:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Alrighty. No google. Got it
02-05-2019T22:10:34,Mippy,Jesus
02-05-2019T22:10:44,Nekonny,I was sort of hoping that Desert fox was going to show up; he had some questions about emofuri
02-05-2019T22:10:48,SpazztasticKiwi,I doubt He’s involved
02-05-2019T22:11:05,SageSaga,"and i dont mean like ""Ok kids- have the sex now"" i mean ""You two better start doing it like animals! Get real rough! Turn my son into a man! Then keep doing it till you cant move anymore! Then do it more MORE MORE!"""
02-05-2019T22:11:22,steelabjur,Nothing like a familiar cheerleading section when you're trying to get busy. :p
02-05-2019T22:11:24,Mippy,:ptv-confused:
02-05-2019T22:11:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Got the picture

02-05-2019T22:13:03,SageSaga,"i mean his dad leaves - but im like ""Was his goal to scare them into never having sex?"""
02-05-2019T22:13:11,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-ohmy:
02-05-2019T22:13:13,Combak,... Did it work?
02-05-2019T22:13:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Works for me
02-05-2019T22:13:33,Sclimshady,Maybe it's like forcing a kid to smoke a whole pack of smokes
02-05-2019T22:14:01,SpazztasticKiwi,If I do much as admitted to my dad I’d met a boy he’d pop out of his grave and yell “you what”
02-05-2019T22:14:03,SageSaga,they do eventually have sex- but not right after that
02-05-2019T22:14:28,SageSaga,it's a pretty graphic sex scene too so- hope your dad is ok with that XD
02-05-2019T22:15:23,steelabjur,"I'd be like ""Whelp, sorry babe, but I'm off to a monastery. The old boy has committed suicide!"""
02-05-2019T22:15:41,Mippy,Eh? I’m pretty sure he’s seen a few hentai and watched Heavy Metal and Fritz the Cat back in the day.
02-05-2019T22:15:49,Bgrmystr2,"are we talkin the tv series or the ova, sage?"
02-05-2019T22:15:58,SageSaga,the new series on Netflix i assume

02-05-2019T22:24:23,Mippy,I'm cathing up with Sheild Hero...fell behind because school
02-05-2019T22:24:26,Zakuru,rose is so god damn tired
02-05-2019T22:24:50,SageSaga,Shield Hero is winding up to its climax
02-05-2019T22:24:54,Sclimshady,"Nice,  5 more days till the next episode"
02-05-2019T22:25:31,Mippy,I'm enjoyig it qute a bit. Might invest in the novels
02-05-2019T22:25:45,SageSaga,im like - how far are they going to go? because the new intro shows stuff that is really far away
02-05-2019T22:26:05,Sclimshady,Ive been thinking about that but there are like 20 of them and theyre not super cheap
02-05-2019T22:26:30,Sclimshady,Theyve got 25 episodes planned
02-05-2019T22:27:10,SageSaga,yeah which is not enough to get to that point
02-05-2019T22:27:40,Mippy,I spend way to much on books and comics on a regular basis. I don't think it'lll bankrupt me.
02-05-2019T22:27:47,Sclimshady,"True, probably gonna be some really condensed episodes soon"
02-05-2019T22:28:02,Mippy,"Well, lets hope for a season two"
02-05-2019T22:28:15,Sclimshady,If were lucky
02-05-2019T22:28:21,SageSaga,i dont think they can do it even if they condense stuff
02-05-2019T22:28:55,SageSaga,they pretty much have to end things with the Church arc and an episode dedicated to the tying up loose ends
02-05-2019T22:29:39,Sclimshady,Of which there are alot

02-05-2019T22:57:51,steelabjur,"Exactly what I was thinking Sclim, sounds like a cult compound in the making."

02-05-2019T22:59:08,Tharkis,having roomates is very hit or miss

02-05-2019T23:00:19,SageSaga,yeah those people suck
02-05-2019T23:00:21,RimaDraws,yea i would rather have my bestie move in with me

02-05-2019T23:02:07,SageSaga,yeah- my second roommate invited a friend over- ended up living on the couch
02-05-2019T23:02:12,RimaDraws,i hate my neighbors when they are loud
02-05-2019T23:02:13,Tharkis,but sharing a single family house with a roomate is a bit more awkward
02-05-2019T23:02:17,SageSaga,they partied a lot- got drunk
02-05-2019T23:02:20,steelabjur,"Shit, sounds like a neighbor we used to have."
02-05-2019T23:02:22,RimaDraws,like my upstairs ones who sound like elephants

02-05-2019T23:03:18,CrimsonHelsing,"yeah, I hate noisy neighbors, though I also kinda hope I'm not one myself. And I live in a house in comparison o.o;"
02-05-2019T23:03:38,SpazztasticKiwi,I have a funny about noisy neighbors but no links
02-05-2019T23:03:46,Tharkis,"if i win the lottery though, i'm totally building a place, and itll have small private dorm rooms with good sound insulation so people can keep their own hours and not bother their neighbors"

02-05-2019T23:27:47,SageSaga,my objective is to slightly beat out Tom's computer
02-05-2019T23:27:48,Bgrmystr2,"lol sage, friendly reminder that a LOT of leaks and other potentially reputable sources say we may be seeing ryzen 3000 by the end of the month"
02-05-2019T23:27:55,SageSaga,i know
02-05-2019T23:27:58,Bgrmystr2,mkay
02-05-2019T23:27:59,SageSaga,im waiting for that
02-05-2019T23:28:22,SageSaga,and i think its announcement at the end of the month- release in June or July
02-05-2019T23:28:24,Snowdayzz,Ryzen user!
02-05-2019T23:28:58,Bgrmystr2,"hm, from what I've been reading and watching, something might be released by the end of the month"

02-05-2019T23:29:00,Bgrmystr2,dunno for sure
02-05-2019T23:29:35,Snowdayzz,Though.. im not sure if the 3000 is am4 supported
02-05-2019T23:29:42,SageSaga,the gold 2700x
02-05-2019T23:29:49,SageSaga,the 3000 is AM4
02-05-2019T23:29:52,Bgrmystr2,"ryzen 3000 chips are am4, bro"
02-05-2019T23:30:19,Bgrmystr2,it's possible that some super low end boards may not support the new chips
02-05-2019T23:30:38,Bgrmystr2,but most boards should from the general consensus
02-05-2019T23:30:44,SageSaga,yep- waiting on hearing that too and seeing what boards come out for PCIe 4
02-05-2019T23:30:52,Bgrmystr2,we'll have to see when it comes out
02-05-2019T23:31:06,Snowdayzz,Hopefully my board will accept the 3000
02-05-2019T23:31:17,Bgrmystr2,which board do you have
02-05-2019T23:32:27,Snowdayzz,Asrock a320m
02-05-2019T23:33:17,Bgrmystr2,hmm
02-05-2019T23:33:20,SageSaga,there's been like- one board confirmed not to support it i think?
02-05-2019T23:33:37,SageSaga,i think it was a low end Asus board though

02-05-2019T23:34:54,RazorToshiba,"Speaking of computers, part of me wants to upgrade my monitor but i'm not sure"
02-05-2019T23:35:17,SageSaga,what kinda graphics card do you have Razor?
02-05-2019T23:35:30,RazorToshiba,Geforce 970
02-05-2019T23:35:48,CrRAR,Ultrawides are the shizz
02-05-2019T23:35:55,RazorToshiba,a little older but still good
02-05-2019T23:35:56,SageSaga,then you should stick with a 1080p probably
02-05-2019T23:36:16,Sclimshady,"I'm off to bed, I have to get up early"
02-05-2019T23:36:25,Bgrmystr2,wouldn't that be able to do 1440p fairly easily?
02-05-2019T23:36:26,Ordithus,Night Sclim
02-05-2019T23:36:26,CrRAR,Yeah if gaming framerates are a beeeg concern
02-05-2019T23:36:27,Bgrmystr2,the 900 series
02-05-2019T23:36:36,SageSaga,no
02-05-2019T23:36:42,Snowdayzz,Thx bgr
02-05-2019T23:36:43,RazorToshiba,i was considering getting a 1080 or something
02-05-2019T23:36:45,SageSaga,it can but its not great
02-05-2019T23:36:48,Bgrmystr2,np snow
02-05-2019T23:36:54,SageSaga,good luck getting a 1080!
02-05-2019T23:37:08,Snowdayzz,Will a gtx960 bottle neck it?
02-05-2019T23:37:10,Bgrmystr2,"make note the links on the page btw snow, it has one that goes to the asrock page for motherboard updates"
02-05-2019T23:37:12,SageSaga,if you mean GTX1080
02-05-2019T23:37:16,SageSaga,and not 1080p
02-05-2019T23:37:17,RazorToshiba,Yes
02-05-2019T23:37:40,RazorToshiba,either a GXT 1080 or a TI if i can find one
02-05-2019T23:37:45,SageSaga,1080's prices have gone up and they dont make them anymore
02-05-2019T23:37:53,qwe304,look on ebay
02-05-2019T23:38:03,qwe304,or craigslist if your area has that
02-05-2019T23:38:06,CrRAR,Yeh 2nd hand swag
02-05-2019T23:38:24,SageSaga,you'll pay retail or higher still unless you get lucky
02-05-2019T23:38:29,SageSaga,and theres a ton of fakes online
02-05-2019T23:38:35,CrRAR,Tru
02-05-2019T23:38:40,andrew202004,What did you guys use to draw ???
02-05-2019T23:38:47,RazorToshiba,mmm
02-05-2019T23:38:57,SageSaga,"I use Clip Studio, Tom uses Photoshop"
02-05-2019T23:39:04,RazorToshiba,CSP for the win
02-05-2019T23:39:11,SageSaga,we both have Cintiq tablets
02-05-2019T23:39:16,RazorToshiba,Love the heck outa clip studio
02-05-2019T23:39:37,ZookeetStudio,"I just came on here, I love the drawing"
02-05-2019T23:39:45,RazorToshiba,Welcome aboard
02-05-2019T23:40:13,ZookeetStudio,Thanks for the welcome Razor
02-05-2019T23:40:34,RazorToshiba,There's a refurb 1080 TI by PNY for 450
02-05-2019T23:41:11,SageSaga,where?
02-05-2019T23:41:40,RazorToshiba,"oof, or i could just get a RTX 2060 for less"
02-05-2019T23:42:12,SageSaga,2060 is pretty good- ok for 1440p but not great
02-05-2019T23:42:31,RazorToshiba,"idk, the PNY one is on some site i've never heard of called KPCSTORE"
02-05-2019T23:42:34,SageSaga,i guess it could do 1080p ultrawide well
02-05-2019T23:43:10,Bgrmystr2,how exactly do you ultrawide 1080p?
02-05-2019T23:43:26,RazorToshiba,1080 but more than 1920 wide
02-05-2019T23:43:30,SageSaga,yep
02-05-2019T23:43:48,Bgrmystr2,ahh so it's not standard 1080p okay
02-05-2019T23:43:49,RazorToshiba,"I drive 3 monitors so, i get even more"
02-05-2019T23:44:12,RazorToshiba,if i turn down some settings i can even game spanning all 3
02-05-2019T23:44:17,SageSaga,its 1080p horizontal but the vertical is longer of course
02-05-2019T23:44:38,RazorToshiba,swap that
02-05-2019T23:44:45,SageSaga,yep
02-05-2019T23:44:53,RazorToshiba,but ye
02-05-2019T23:45:24,SageSaga,"i was typing while thinking ""Hmm this background- do i need to draw a penthouse or a cruise ship?"
02-05-2019T23:45:38,RimaDraws,cruise ship
02-05-2019T23:45:50,Ordithus,Niagara Falls
02-05-2019T23:46:07,SageSaga,that would be too easy
02-05-2019T23:46:27,Ordithus,What?  You mean you're already done?
02-05-2019T23:46:36,SageSaga,XD
02-05-2019T23:46:46,Ordithus,:csagesaga-c1:
02-05-2019T23:47:48,RazorToshiba,lol
02-05-2019T23:48:13,RazorToshiba,You and tom over here drawing on Cintiq's and i'm here with a Surface pro 5
02-05-2019T23:48:30,RazorToshiba,it gets the job done tho
02-05-2019T23:48:32,SageSaga,i havent tried the Pro 5
02-05-2019T23:48:40,Ordithus,I've got the 4
02-05-2019T23:48:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Just watched this lady proposing to her bf at a baseball game. Dude just takes off sprinting
02-05-2019T23:48:44,RimaDraws,i have a xp pen 22E
02-05-2019T23:48:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Think it was a no
02-05-2019T23:48:47,RazorToshiba,It's nice! I have the pen from the 4
02-05-2019T23:48:47,SageSaga,i tried the 4- it was terrible
02-05-2019T23:48:49,Ordithus,Flicker flicker :(
02-05-2019T23:49:18,RazorToshiba,"If you didn't like the 4 you probably wouldn't like the 5, it's just the 4 with less lag and better pressure if you get the new pen which I didn't"
02-05-2019T23:49:30,Ordithus,It's a pretty nice windows ipad when it works
02-05-2019T23:49:35,Snowdayzz,I used to draw on a lenovo flex 2 then i changed to drawing on my pc with a huion
02-05-2019T23:49:49,RazorToshiba,oof
02-05-2019T23:49:58,Corinthian,I'm heading out. Night
02-05-2019T23:50:03,Ordithus,Night Corin
02-05-2019T23:50:09,SageSaga,Once you go cintiq- only your wallet will make you go back to anything else
02-05-2019T23:50:12,Snowdayzz,Night
02-05-2019T23:50:18,RazorToshiba,lol
02-05-2019T23:50:27,RazorToshiba,I do like that i can draw literally anywhere with it tho
02-05-2019T23:50:49,SageSaga,i have a Cintiq Companion so i can draw anywhere
02-05-2019T23:50:56,RazorToshiba,noice
02-05-2019T23:51:06,Snowdayzz,I have a note 8:ptv-laugh:
02-05-2019T23:51:06,RazorToshiba,That was my other choice
02-05-2019T23:51:07,SageSaga,so long as an outlet in nearby every 2 and a half hours
02-05-2019T23:51:20,RazorToshiba,And that's one of the reasons i picked the surface lol
02-05-2019T23:51:37,SageSaga,i hear the iPad Pro is amazing for drawing now
02-05-2019T23:51:47,SageSaga,but Clip Studio is a pay service on it
02-05-2019T23:52:10,RazorToshiba,"it really is, my brother has one, It took me a minute to get used to it, but it works really well, very responsive"
02-05-2019T23:52:47,RazorToshiba,"Ah, see i was using his copy of that one app everyone raves about... i forgot the name"
02-05-2019T23:52:50,ZRO4825,gaaaaaaaah....HATE late shifts
02-05-2019T23:52:57,Ordithus,Hi ZRO
02-05-2019T23:53:03,ZRO4825,Hiyas '.'/
02-05-2019T23:53:30,SageSaga,Zro! Welcome to a new month
02-05-2019T23:53:37,RazorToshiba,Procreate! That's the one
02-05-2019T23:53:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Proposal fails. Why am I watching this
02-05-2019T23:53:51,SageSaga,sounds dirty
02-05-2019T23:53:53,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-MikeLewd:
02-05-2019T23:54:04,RazorToshiba,:eyes: :sweat_drops:
02-05-2019T23:54:10,ZRO4825,"Yes, Sage, I know, and I was already thinking earlier."
02-05-2019T23:54:18,ZRO4825,"I didn't accomplish much, but I *was* thinking."
02-05-2019T23:54:33,RazorToshiba,Yeah they didn't think that name through
02-05-2019T23:54:34,Bgrmystr2,that's dangerous zro
02-05-2019T23:54:40,Ordithus,I tried thinking once.  Woke up on the floor a month later
02-05-2019T23:54:44,ZRO4825,"I know, I was even driving at the same time!"
02-05-2019T23:54:50,RazorToshiba,Thinking is a dangerous thing
02-05-2019T23:54:56,ZRO4825,Thank goodness I can drive on auto-pilot.
02-05-2019T23:55:19,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock:
02-05-2019T23:55:25,Bgrmystr2,did you wrong side of the road?
02-05-2019T23:55:28,RazorToshiba,"ah, so you got one of them fancy cars"
02-05-2019T23:55:38,Bgrmystr2,lol Razro pls
02-05-2019T23:55:38,RazorToshiba,Tesla?
02-05-2019T23:55:40,Bgrmystr2,no
02-05-2019T23:55:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I heard a thought struck you once. You were in the hospital for a week
02-05-2019T23:55:41,ZRO4825,"No, Razor, I'm just that used to driving, lol"
02-05-2019T23:55:44,RazorToshiba,XD
02-05-2019T23:55:59,Ordithus,:fire:
02-05-2019T23:56:00,Bgrmystr2,"Razor, that's not what autopilot means in that context"
02-05-2019T23:56:07,ZRO4825,I wouldn't trust a Tesla to drive for me any further than I can throw it. :rofl:
02-05-2019T23:56:14,RazorToshiba,I know i was doin a joke
02-05-2019T23:56:15,SageSaga,everyone who knows Zro was laughing at the idea of Zro in a tesla
02-05-2019T23:56:24,ZRO4825,"^ Truth, lol"
02-05-2019T23:56:30,Bgrmystr2,"lol to be fair, I'd actually expect it"
02-05-2019T23:56:30,RazorToshiba,XD
02-05-2019T23:56:33,Bgrmystr2,driving? too much work
02-05-2019T23:56:40,Snowdayzz,I havent seen a tesla with my own eyes
02-05-2019T23:56:43,Bgrmystr2,"let the car drive, so he can do other more important shit"
02-05-2019T23:56:47,RazorToshiba,I've seen a few
02-05-2019T23:56:57,SageSaga,Tom has ridden in one
02-05-2019T23:56:59,Snowdayzz,Singapore doesnt sell them
02-05-2019T23:57:02,ZRO4825,"I've seen'em. Can't be bothered. Too expensive, too much hassle, and hell no I'm not trusting it to do the driving, I'd be bored as HELL."
02-05-2019T23:57:05,RazorToshiba,awh
02-05-2019T23:57:11,Ordithus,"I have, too.  Quiet, quick."
02-05-2019T23:57:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Not sure I’d trust auto drive
02-05-2019T23:57:42,Ordithus,I'd use it but I'd definitely pay attention
02-05-2019T23:57:43,Snowdayzz,Hmm
02-05-2019T23:57:44,Bgrmystr2,"they're better drivers across the board than most people, but that's just cuz people here in the US can't drive worth a fuck"
02-05-2019T23:57:45,RazorToshiba,"I thought about going electric, but then i realized ""Hey i can by a Lancer for half the money"" so I did that instead"
02-05-2019T23:57:51,Bgrmystr2,so it doesn't take much
02-05-2019T23:58:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Don’t doubt Tom’s been in one
02-05-2019T23:58:12,Snowdayzz,I got a van but its a manual so its very fun to drive
02-05-2019T23:58:15,Ordithus,Doesn't Mark have one?
02-05-2019T23:58:22,RazorToshiba,Manual is so good
02-05-2019T23:58:22,ZRO4825,"My driving is worth quite a bit more than a fuck. I mean, apparently so, I get to drive all the time, as for the other...."
02-05-2019T23:58:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Yep
02-05-2019T23:58:23,SageSaga,yes
02-05-2019T23:58:43,Bgrmystr2,har har zro
02-05-2019T23:58:52,ZRO4825,=D
02-05-2019T23:59:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Marks got an X last I heard
02-05-2019T23:59:23,Snowdayzz,What evey happened to marks van🤨
02-05-2019T23:59:25,RazorToshiba,Did he?
02-05-2019T23:59:28,Snowdayzz,Ever*
02-05-2019T23:59:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Or something like it. Says he likes it for long trips
02-05-2019T23:59:45,Ordithus,"I'd consider an electric or hybrid, but it's hard to beat a paid-off economical and reliable car"
02-05-2019T23:59:52,RazorToshiba,using that sweet sweet youtube cash
02-05-2019T23:59:58,SpazztasticKiwi,He’s still got the van. He’s said he had to get it fixed at one point. Couldn’t do anything with it till then
