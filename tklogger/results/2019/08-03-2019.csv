08-03-2019T01:30:12,Dadrobit,"Wait, I don't frequent furry sitesso I honestly don't know. But FA isn't strictly a ""this image must have at least some furryness to it"" site?"

08-03-2019T01:30:19,Dadrobit,sites so*

08-03-2019T01:33:11,TrexM,that doesn't have the same ring
08-03-2019T01:33:50,MrRetroRealm,I actually don't really care for either cuz they both have their own brand of weirdness so I just post stuff on either DA or Twitter
08-03-2019T01:34:20,TrexM,I always end up on e621
08-03-2019T01:34:47,TrexM,"(not my art, but just looking at stuff)"

08-03-2019T01:41:43,MrRetroRealm,Oh thanks goodness
08-03-2019T01:41:44,MrEase,"Mark's been dead for 7 years, Tom's just getting over it, all those videos weren't really him"

08-03-2019T02:31:02,ThorburnCreative,wb sage
08-03-2019T02:31:15,ThorburnCreative,chat seems to be hibernating
08-03-2019T02:31:58,Bgrmystr2,"hey sorry, stepped out for a few"
08-03-2019T02:32:48,Bgrmystr2,this lineart is lookin nice
08-03-2019T02:34:15,ThorburnCreative,"Aye, it is. tho beardy dude not looking too happy about somethin"
08-03-2019T02:35:09,SageSaga,you dont know who Beardy dude is?
08-03-2019T02:35:30,ZRO4825,"Well, to be fair, don't believe we've seen him for a good while :3"
08-03-2019T02:36:22,SageSaga,Hey now Zro- im working on going into a plug because I dont know if Thorburn even knows about the comic so if you could not ruin my smooth moves- :P
08-03-2019T02:37:09,sunblaze,smooth moves........:ptv-nope:
08-03-2019T02:37:14,ThorburnCreative,"I recognise him, but I'm terrible at placing people"
08-03-2019T02:37:34,SageSaga,have you read Artificial Incident?
08-03-2019T02:38:21,ThorburnCreative,"Yes, tho I may be a few weeks behind"
08-03-2019T02:38:28,sunblaze,after that time hir beard probably got worse.
08-03-2019T02:38:38,sunblaze,his
08-03-2019T02:38:53,SageSaga,It's Kevin - only scene in Chapter 0 - The Prologue
08-03-2019T02:39:15,ThorburnCreative,"Ah, that figures"
08-03-2019T02:39:17,ZRO4825,"Sorry, Sage, didn't you know I exist to poke holes in people's bubbles? :3"
08-03-2019T02:39:42,SageSaga,that's Murder for bubble boys Zro
08-03-2019T02:39:44,SageSaga,you monster
08-03-2019T02:39:59,ThorburnCreative,been a fair few months since I re-read the whole thing
08-03-2019T02:40:03,Bgrmystr2,life is possible outside the bubble
08-03-2019T02:40:20,Bgrmystr2,Zro just encourages people to realize that :V
08-03-2019T02:40:23,SageSaga,you can reread the whole thing- in the physical copy of the book!
08-03-2019T02:40:26,SageSaga,http://kck.st/2C7YTbC
08-03-2019T02:40:35,SageSaga,still got my smooth moves
08-03-2019T02:40:42,ZRO4825,"Oy now, I only poke holes in bubbles when absolutely safe to do so! I'm not THAT big an asshole! o_o;"
08-03-2019T02:41:00,ThorburnCreative,"heh, knew that was coming. Only been plugging the whole stream XD"
08-03-2019T02:41:13,SageSaga,i have to!
08-03-2019T02:42:01,ThorburnCreative,"currently waving between 'tip jar' contribution, and going the whole hog to make it worth the postage"
08-03-2019T02:42:23,Bgrmystr2,"just cuz you live in your own bubble popping other ppl's bubbles doesn't make you an asshole, zro. Enjoying it does. :V"
08-03-2019T02:42:37,Bgrmystr2,:fire::fire_engine:
08-03-2019T02:43:07,ThorburnCreative,but why pop bubbles if you don't enjoy it? XP
08-03-2019T02:43:23,Bgrmystr2,because it's the right thing to do.
08-03-2019T02:44:20,ZRO4825,Two words.
08-03-2019T02:44:23,ZRO4825,Bubble Wrap.
08-03-2019T02:44:34,Bgrmystr2,"hey, that's just fun."
08-03-2019T02:45:12,SageSaga,so  - well aware this wouldnt SAVE money- but if you put helium in the bubbles of a bubble mailer- would it cost less to ship?
08-03-2019T02:45:25,Bgrmystr2,uh..
08-03-2019T02:45:30,Bgrmystr2,I mean..
08-03-2019T02:45:57,Bgrmystr2,"I think? Cuz helium would make it weigh less.. technically, but not sure by how much.."
08-03-2019T02:46:02,Bgrmystr2,cuz I think they only put air in the bubbles
08-03-2019T02:46:16,Bgrmystr2,though I'm not sure on that.
08-03-2019T02:46:45,SageSaga,so you need to find out the amount of air in a bubble mailer- then replace it with helium to determine the lift
08-03-2019T02:46:52,Bgrmystr2,haha yeah
08-03-2019T02:46:52,ZRO4825,"I mean, technically it is all shipped by weight...so if you were to use helium to offset some of the weight somehow, that *should* lower the cost of shipping..."
08-03-2019T02:47:01,Bgrmystr2,yeh zro
08-03-2019T02:47:32,SageSaga,problem is helium is expensive so you offset your cost in such a way that you spent waaaay more-
08-03-2019T02:47:45,Bgrmystr2,eee..
08-03-2019T02:47:53,SageSaga,but! what if i had the super power to transform air into helium?
08-03-2019T02:48:16,Bgrmystr2,I mean.. it would technically be an investment if you ship back and forth to the same place constantly using the same bubble wrap.
08-03-2019T02:48:27,Bgrmystr2,then I would think it might eventually pay for itself.
08-03-2019T02:48:56,Bgrmystr2,how long it would take though xD
08-03-2019T02:50:27,ThorburnCreative,"by my reconing, you'd save at most a gram on an A4-ish package"
08-03-2019T02:52:09,ThorburnCreative,maybe 1/20 of total mass? just a guesstimate
08-03-2019T02:52:29,SageSaga,the goal would be to reduce the weight by 1 oz
08-03-2019T02:53:09,SageSaga,or 28 grams
08-03-2019T02:54:05,ThorburnCreative,"hm, probably not gonna happen. problem is that air is very light already"
08-03-2019T02:54:31,ThorburnCreative,ah well XD
08-03-2019T02:55:59,sunblaze,ok going back to some sleep
08-03-2019T02:56:00,sunblaze,bye
08-03-2019T02:56:21,ZRO4825,"G'night Sunblaze, take care~"
08-03-2019T02:56:31,ThorburnCreative,G'night blaze!
08-03-2019T02:57:12,Bgrmystr2,gnight
08-03-2019T02:57:26,SageSaga,take care Sunblaze!
08-03-2019T02:57:55,JeremySenpai,:cjeremysenpai-Yo:Sage
08-03-2019T02:58:32,ZRO4825,"I know you're using CSP, Sage, what's Fluff using, if you know?"
08-03-2019T02:58:39,SageSaga,yo Jeremy
08-03-2019T02:59:20,Bgrmystr2,Fluff's using Clip studio as well
08-03-2019T02:59:30,Bgrmystr2,he has a physical copy called Manga Studio that he bought
08-03-2019T02:59:35,ZRO4825,That's what I was thinking myself. But couldn't remember correctly.
08-03-2019T02:59:51,SageSaga,I think he also still has a copy of Photoshop but i dont know how much he uses it now
08-03-2019T02:59:56,Bgrmystr2,but it's basically Clip Studio but from a different company to make it a physical product you can get off a shelf
08-03-2019T03:00:13,SageSaga,It is the same
08-03-2019T03:00:18,Bgrmystr2,"I don't think I ever see him use photoshop on stream, always clip"
08-03-2019T03:00:29,SageSaga,he used to use it
08-03-2019T03:00:56,Bgrmystr2,"hmm, maybe he used it to make the Ayn animation? I remember he used something different from clip to animate it"
08-03-2019T03:01:01,Bgrmystr2,dunno what though
08-03-2019T03:01:20,ZRO4825,You sure? Cuz I seem to recall him commenting about CSP's animation system being weird (cuz it is)
08-03-2019T03:01:36,SageSaga,i think he uses Photoshop for animations
08-03-2019T03:04:21,Bgrmystr2,Yeah I'm 99.9% sure he did an animation outside of Clip
08-03-2019T03:06:52,ZRO4825,I've only ever seen him do that Ayn animattion
08-03-2019T03:06:58,ZRO4825,animation*
08-03-2019T03:09:37,ZRO4825,:thinking: Aynimation?
08-03-2019T03:09:59,Bgrmystr2,Well I did watch him for the past 4 years in July
08-03-2019T03:10:05,ThorburnCreative,Lol. 'twas excellent as well.
08-03-2019T03:10:21,Bgrmystr2,"so it might not have been the Ayn one, might have been a different one"
08-03-2019T03:10:54,SageSaga,i think he did that one in photoshop because Clip was so annoying to animate in
08-03-2019T03:11:27,SageSaga,clip has some great animation features- but the way they work feels so backwards or silly
08-03-2019T03:11:51,ZRO4825,"IT IS! >_< It animates by LAYERS!! First time I tried to use it I was just like ""wtf is this process?!?"""
08-03-2019T03:11:54,SageSaga,yet looks great for frame by frame animation
08-03-2019T03:12:07,ThorburnCreative,"found the tweet: ""My first animation in a long time, and getting used to CSP's animation suite"""
08-03-2019T03:13:12,ThorburnCreative,... no idea how I found it so quick
08-03-2019T03:13:39,SageSaga,i dont think its that hard- he doesnt tweet that much and a key word or two does it- like animation
08-03-2019T03:14:02,ZRO4825,Hmm...time to make myself fatter and gorge on  Girl Scout cookies
08-03-2019T03:14:25,SageSaga,ready for some old school anime music?
08-03-2019T03:14:33,ZRO4825,And by gorge I actually mean like...half a pack of thin mints
08-03-2019T03:14:34,ThorburnCreative,"yeah, but my method was basically mashing 'page down' a few times :)"
08-03-2019T03:15:44,ThorburnCreative,"I wouldn't know 'old school anime' if it bit me, but sure"
08-03-2019T03:16:02,ZRO4825,"I do not recognize this song at *all*, lol"
08-03-2019T03:16:27,SageSaga,its not even that old but i figure with the people here-
08-03-2019T03:16:35,SageSaga,this is from Bleach
08-03-2019T03:16:43,ZRO4825,It is?
08-03-2019T03:16:47,SageSaga,bleach had some good music
08-03-2019T03:16:52,SageSaga,for a while
08-03-2019T03:16:54,ZRO4825,"I don't recognize it, and I loved Bleach :thinking:"
08-03-2019T03:17:08,ZRO4825,Was it one of the endings?
08-03-2019T03:17:47,ZRO4825,"Actually, yeah, had to be, cuz I woulda recognize the intros, but I tended to skip the outro (Wanted to watch the next ep, damnit! lol)"
08-03-2019T03:18:44,SageSaga,this isnt anime btw
08-03-2019T03:18:52,SageSaga,and yeah it was the second Ending from Bleach
08-03-2019T03:19:09,ZRO4825,"Oh good lord, yeah, no wonder I didn't recognize it then :joy:"
08-03-2019T03:19:33,ZRO4825,"I skipped outros super fast at that point in the series, by the time I got into it we were on like...season 3 or 4 I think? lol"
08-03-2019T03:21:31,ZRO4825,"That supposed to be a fist-bump, or just a ""both sides of the mirror"" deal?"
08-03-2019T03:21:59,SageSaga,Mirror- hes in the background and fading away from memory
08-03-2019T03:22:21,ZRO4825,"Was my guess the more I thought on it, but the fists up kept nagging at my curiosity, lol"
08-03-2019T03:22:51,SageSaga,you know this song?
08-03-2019T03:22:55,Bgrmystr2,ooooo I didn't know you had this song
08-03-2019T03:22:58,Bgrmystr2,<3
08-03-2019T03:23:03,ZRO4825,This sounds like GitS
08-03-2019T03:23:11,Bgrmystr2,"I know what it is, one of my favirotes"
08-03-2019T03:23:12,SageSaga,GJ
08-03-2019T03:23:17,Bgrmystr2,favorites* even
08-03-2019T03:23:27,ZRO4825,"Okay, yeah, it definitely is. :joy:"
08-03-2019T03:23:37,Bgrmystr2,"Inner Universe is so badass, there's so damn much feeling in this song"
08-03-2019T03:23:40,ZRO4825,"How the hell did I pick that out that early? lol   I haven't seen ANY of that series in forever, lol"
08-03-2019T03:27:33,SageSaga,you know this one
08-03-2019T03:28:19,Bgrmystr2,"ah, more bleach"
08-03-2019T03:28:22,ZRO4825,"Yup, lol"

08-03-2019T03:34:04,Bgrmystr2,sounds good though

08-03-2019T03:34:52,ZRO4825,Doesn't ring a bell to me either atm :x
08-03-2019T03:34:59,Bgrmystr2,I have a feeling it's on my list of things to watch
08-03-2019T03:35:07,Bgrmystr2,but one of the ones I haven't watched yet
08-03-2019T03:35:52,SageSaga,omg
08-03-2019T03:35:58,ZRO4825,Well I know it's NOT Dog Days :joy
08-03-2019T03:36:02,ZRO4825,:joy:*
08-03-2019T03:36:06,SageSaga,Fate Stay Night
08-03-2019T03:36:15,ZRO4825,"I have watched that series entirely too many times for my own good. Dog Days, that is."
08-03-2019T03:36:23,ZRO4825,I haven't watched ANY of the Fate series yet.
08-03-2019T03:36:40,SageSaga,how about this one?
08-03-2019T03:37:05,Bgrmystr2,yeah didn't watch anything from Fate/Stay
08-03-2019T03:37:10,Bgrmystr2,hmm..
08-03-2019T03:37:27,ZRO4825,"Nope, haven't heard this before either, sounds like Tenacious D though."
08-03-2019T03:37:35,SageSaga,XD
08-03-2019T03:37:43,SageSaga,Wonderboy! Tenacious D
08-03-2019T03:37:58,ZRO4825,"Well at least my guess wasn't wrong, lol"
08-03-2019T03:38:41,Bgrmystr2,"a little hard for me to hear, friend is watchin DBSuper atm"
08-03-2019T03:38:57,ZRO4825,Tell'em to calm it down on the screams and power up the singing. :P
08-03-2019T03:39:15,Bgrmystr2,lol eh
08-03-2019T03:40:46,ZRO4825,"I managed to paper-cut my fingertip on the stupid dipping cups at work earlier today. Paper cut on fuckin plastic containers....not all that deep, but damn did it sting."
08-03-2019T03:42:18,ThorburnCreative,youch - fingertips are the worst places as well
08-03-2019T03:42:34,Bgrmystr2,Oh I know this song! :V
08-03-2019T03:43:03,SageSaga,the beginning of the list
08-03-2019T03:43:11,Bgrmystr2,ikr! xD

08-03-2019T03:45:05,SageSaga,not quite
08-03-2019T03:45:13,SageSaga,i have a bunch set to skip- including this
08-03-2019T03:45:46,SageSaga,i love this music but i like to change up what we start on
08-03-2019T03:46:43,ThorburnCreative,"A question if I may, Sage: how long do you expect AI to run? in chapters, books, etc"
08-03-2019T03:47:38,ZRO4825,Never ask that about Yosh. Yosh is never ending. :eyes:
08-03-2019T03:47:41,SageSaga,thats a good question - let's see- i think 5 books- not sure on that but that's around what i have
08-03-2019T03:47:49,SageSaga,thats 30 chapters
08-03-2019T03:48:13,ThorburnCreative,sounds good. BRB
08-03-2019T03:48:25,SageSaga,Yosh is going into one of its final acts right now...
08-03-2019T03:48:35,ZRO4825,Oh?
08-03-2019T03:49:00,SageSaga,The Battle against Death
08-03-2019T03:49:39,ZRO4825,Ahhh
08-03-2019T03:49:50,ZRO4825,"Wasn't sure if that's actually where we were headed, or another delaying action."
08-03-2019T03:50:30,SageSaga,nope- we hit critical mass and its time to explode
08-03-2019T03:50:53,ZRO4825,Time to let Phil start smacking people with the stick! O_O/

08-03-2019T03:56:38,SageSaga,?
08-03-2019T03:56:48,ZRO4825,Patreon's updated look.
08-03-2019T03:56:57,ZRO4825,Feel like they tried too hard to streamline.
08-03-2019T03:57:24,ThorburnCreative,"Me neither. It has that 'similar, but slightly wrong' feel to it"
08-03-2019T04:00:42,RimaDraws,how in the crap do you find your creators?
08-03-2019T04:03:10,RimaDraws,nvm found it

08-03-2019T04:10:31,RimaDraws,np
08-03-2019T04:10:57,RimaDraws,i also tweeted it on twitter
08-03-2019T04:13:06,RimaDraws,shared you know
08-03-2019T04:13:22,SageSaga,i appreciate it
08-03-2019T04:13:44,RimaDraws,np
08-03-2019T04:15:11,SageSaga,now to figure out why my brain wont work
08-03-2019T04:15:32,ZRO4825,It IS 4:15am :P
08-03-2019T04:15:52,SageSaga,that's never stopped it before!
08-03-2019T04:15:53,RimaDraws,i am a hour behind you lol
08-03-2019T04:16:05,SageSaga,. . . i did get up really early this morning though
08-03-2019T04:17:00,SageSaga,wait- is it possible i can do this with 2 point perspective and not 3 point?
08-03-2019T04:20:02,RimaDraws,i am not sure
08-03-2019T04:24:37,RimaDraws,i have forgotten 2 point and 3 point perspective
08-03-2019T04:25:15,RimaDraws,how do you do that setting in csp?
08-03-2019T04:25:31,SageSaga,there's a perspective ruler
08-03-2019T04:26:00,SageSaga,and you can turn on the grid- thing is though- this isnt working how i think it should- which means im having trouble realizing this in perspective
08-03-2019T04:26:21,RimaDraws,oooh
08-03-2019T04:26:34,SageSaga,this would be great if-
08-03-2019T04:26:37,SageSaga,this were a corner
08-03-2019T04:27:02,RimaDraws,yea might be easier?
08-03-2019T04:27:27,SageSaga,but its not supposed to be a corner
08-03-2019T04:27:31,RimaDraws,nope
08-03-2019T04:27:40,SageSaga,so im thinking about this all wrong
08-03-2019T04:28:06,SageSaga,in perspective - a corner is the center of the meeting of two vanishing points-
08-03-2019T04:28:12,RimaDraws,yes
08-03-2019T04:28:22,SageSaga,so i need to move the corner off screen
08-03-2019T04:29:24,RimaDraws,yea. and?
08-03-2019T04:30:39,SageSaga,i have the corner off screen but the angle isnt right
08-03-2019T04:31:10,RimaDraws,hmmm this is tough
08-03-2019T04:32:18,RimaDraws,ive done 2 point perspective but not 3. maybe this IS a 2 point instead of 3?
08-03-2019T04:32:49,SageSaga,it needs to be 3 to do the looking upward
08-03-2019T04:33:00,RimaDraws,"ah yea, see i never learned that"
08-03-2019T04:34:26,SageSaga,man- hmmm
08-03-2019T04:37:03,RimaDraws,yea i may have to learn it sometime.
08-03-2019T04:41:31,SageSaga,cant - make - cube- rotate- right-way
08-03-2019T04:42:44,SageSaga,darn cube
08-03-2019T04:43:43,SageSaga,can i just free hand this?
08-03-2019T04:46:42,RimaDraws,hard to free hand and get the lines straight lol. it may be easier.
08-03-2019T04:50:18,SageSaga,i need the grid to do this for me-
08-03-2019T04:50:52,SageSaga,if i can get the grid to match this- it might work
08-03-2019T04:51:07,SageSaga,but how do i do that-
08-03-2019T04:53:21,RimaDraws,well you could always use the transform layer tool and just tilt it slightly to match
08-03-2019T04:53:22,RimaDraws,?
08-03-2019T04:53:38,SageSaga,cant do that
08-03-2019T04:54:25,SageSaga,if it was off just by the slightest bit it would be obvious
08-03-2019T04:56:02,RimaDraws,ooh. well i need some sleep and my heartburn is killing me
08-03-2019T04:56:06,RimaDraws,so nighty night sage
08-03-2019T04:56:12,SageSaga,take care good luck!

08-03-2019T15:36:20,SageSaga,i think just having people say what the link is before linking something is a good compromise to no links without permission

08-03-2019T15:37:10,sunblaze,so kinda like a short summary and then the link?

08-03-2019T15:40:32,Ordithus,So much (in)convenient censoring this page
08-03-2019T15:41:12,SageSaga,it's great- i love convenient censoring
08-03-2019T15:41:31,BadFoMo,"I don't know why, but I like this type of censoring."
08-03-2019T15:42:03,SageSaga,i like it because it takes advantage of comic panels which are normally seen as constraints
08-03-2019T15:43:19,Bgrmystr2,and it's still constraining xD
08-03-2019T15:43:58,SageSaga,no - it is enabling!
08-03-2019T15:44:16,Bgrmystr2,uh..
08-03-2019T15:44:27,Bgrmystr2,that's the opposite of convenient censorship but okay xD

08-03-2019T15:52:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Apron and shirt got much of it
08-03-2019T15:52:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Stopped it from getting to boob valley. But my neck got splattered
08-03-2019T15:52:58,BadFoMo,Ouch.
08-03-2019T15:53:47,Ordithus,Yikes! I hope it wasn't too bad
08-03-2019T15:54:23,SpazztasticKiwi,No evidence of blisters at least yet but it stung
08-03-2019T15:54:37,SageSaga,few weeks ago i dropped a burger in a bunch of grease in a pan- like a water gun it all splashed from my hand all the way up to my elbow in a line
08-03-2019T15:54:44,SpazztasticKiwi,I should be fine
08-03-2019T15:55:06,BadFoMo,Ouch again.
08-03-2019T15:55:10,Ordithus,"Ow Sage.  Good to hear Kiwi, hope for a speedy recovery"
08-03-2019T15:55:12,SageSaga,i got it all under water fast enough to prevent a major burn except for a spot on my hand it stayed on a second too long
08-03-2019T15:55:16,sunblaze,sounds painful
08-03-2019T15:55:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Now you got your first tiger stripe
08-03-2019T15:55:40,Ordithus,Somehow working the fryers at McDonalds for a year I avoided any real burns
08-03-2019T15:56:07,TheBeckoner,Hellloo
08-03-2019T15:56:09,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve splattered myself with grease a few times too. Got some lttle droplets on my arm last night
08-03-2019T15:56:19,TheBeckoner,Chem test is over! Tim for spring break...
08-03-2019T15:56:23,TheBeckoner,Time*
08-03-2019T15:56:28,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s like the stuff seals out bare skin
08-03-2019T15:56:32,SpazztasticKiwi,seeks
08-03-2019T15:56:37,SpazztasticKiwi,I give up

08-03-2019T15:56:59,TheBeckoner,The new skin stuff?
08-03-2019T15:57:02,SageSaga,hmm- how do i make sleeping pad look fluffy without making it look too furry-
08-03-2019T15:57:09,SageSaga,or do i just make it furry-

08-03-2019T15:57:45,TheBeckoner,bulges like a comforter would have?
08-03-2019T15:58:00,Ordithus,Bye Kiwi!
08-03-2019T15:58:30,Ordithus,Could be something like a bear skin for a sleeping pad
08-03-2019T15:59:41,BadFoMo,@SageSaga Just copy Flora's fur style?
08-03-2019T15:59:47,SageSaga,i actually have some furry brushes

08-03-2019T18:06:20,Ordithus,Hi Tom
08-03-2019T18:06:33,SageSaga,wb Tom
08-03-2019T18:06:39,SageSaga,Lann give you a code?
08-03-2019T18:06:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Wasn’t he here the whole time?
08-03-2019T18:06:46,SpazztasticKiwi,In spirit
08-03-2019T18:07:05,SageSaga,he was playing a game that cannot be named
08-03-2019T18:07:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Apex
08-03-2019T18:07:20,SageSaga,nope
08-03-2019T18:07:25,SageSaga,a sin upon lord Gaben
08-03-2019T18:07:36,Twokinds,I was signed up for the alpha way back when I first heard about it
08-03-2019T18:07:42,Twokinds,Before the whole Epic thing
08-03-2019T18:08:03,Twokinds,Figured I might as well try it
08-03-2019T18:08:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Some have been finding issue with it cause it’s fortnight back and forth
08-03-2019T18:08:52,SpazztasticKiwi,And so.. how’s it
08-03-2019T18:08:58,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Ello o/
08-03-2019T18:09:36,SageSaga,"im strictly against Epic because of their paying companies to be exclusive on the PC, it's a practice ive been hoping would go away after Origin launched and has had so many issues"
08-03-2019T18:10:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Isn’t epic losing profits?
08-03-2019T18:10:16,SageSaga,we need it to stay that way to get change
08-03-2019T18:10:33,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d seen and heard they were losing monz
08-03-2019T18:11:19,SpazztasticKiwi,But I wonder how much is true numbers and what’s “let’s spread rumors so they seem worse”
08-03-2019T18:12:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also, I’ll say I’m the only person sitting out in their car with anime tunes blaring out the window"
08-03-2019T18:16:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Stream brainfart
08-03-2019T18:18:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Is it considered convenient that my internet is derping right around time for me to go back in?
08-03-2019T18:21:08,Ordithus,That is more inconvenient than the censorship here
08-03-2019T18:22:04,AshtonFinel,Hi
08-03-2019T18:23:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Ya. Shame for you

08-03-2019T18:41:35,Ordithus,"The one in the upper left was made by Maty, I believe"
08-03-2019T18:42:19,SageSaga,Maty made the bouncing Catgirl as a gift to me
08-03-2019T18:42:29,SageSaga,the other one is Rem from *UNKNOWN ARTIST*
08-03-2019T18:42:36,SageSaga,Rem is just best girl so shes here...
08-03-2019T18:43:43,SageSaga,normally i would search for the artist of the Rem gif but unfortunately ive seen the gif put on so many gif sites that it would take some time unless i got lucky to track down the creator
08-03-2019T18:50:04,sunblaze,haha
08-03-2019T18:50:20,sunblaze,from the sketch I figured nyna is nibbling on elven ears

08-03-2019T19:29:56,SageSaga,ty and good job tracking it down
08-03-2019T19:30:28,Bgrmystr2,"wasn't too difficult, just a screencap of the gif so I could reverse search it with IQDB, then reverse search the full gif using the same site"
08-03-2019T19:30:55,Bgrmystr2,"and danbooru gives the source for images most the time, so"
08-03-2019T19:31:09,Bgrmystr2,s'all good. :thumbsup:
08-03-2019T19:44:00,SageSaga,did i forget anything?

08-03-2019T21:06:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Finally finishing my ravioli
08-03-2019T21:27:24,Dadrobit,"Light rail? Central Mesa uses one out here, never had the opportunity to use it though, doesn't quite have enough coverage for me to use it for anything reasonable."
08-03-2019T21:29:11,Dadrobit,"I mean, it goes out into Phoenix which is nice, but it doesn't reach far enough out to my own location."
08-03-2019T23:06:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Why do the new squid sharks in Subnautica look like Sharktopus from Syfy
