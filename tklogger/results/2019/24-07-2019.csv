24-07-2019T02:07:13,CrimsonQuill,Morning
24-07-2019T02:07:16,CrimsonQuill,Anyone here?
24-07-2019T02:07:20,CrimsonQuill,:ctwokinds-sadtrace2:
24-07-2019T02:34:07,Bgrmystr2,I would be here if my computer hadn't decided to randomly restart while installing GPU drivers.
24-07-2019T02:34:20,CrimsonQuill,XD
24-07-2019T02:34:27,Yevni,Oml
24-07-2019T02:34:39,Yevni,my computer is still pending restart with it's updates
24-07-2019T02:34:40,CrimsonQuill,Study again this morning....
24-07-2019T02:34:46,CrimsonQuill,groans
24-07-2019T02:34:51,Yevni,I head to canada in 6 hours
24-07-2019T02:34:55,CrimsonQuill,Oh
24-07-2019T02:34:55,Yevni,excite
24-07-2019T02:35:04,CrimsonQuill,Aeroplane or boat or road?
24-07-2019T02:35:13,Yevni,Motorcyclee
24-07-2019T02:35:19,CrimsonQuill,So road
24-07-2019T02:35:20,CrimsonQuill,Nice
24-07-2019T02:35:20,Bgrmystr2,Oh look at that it wants to restart AGAIN :D!?@
24-07-2019T02:35:27,Bgrmystr2,computer why
24-07-2019T02:35:37,Yevni,computer goes Beeo
24-07-2019T02:35:38,CrimsonQuill,It probably wants to torture you
24-07-2019T02:35:41,Yevni,beep*
24-07-2019T02:35:49,CrimsonQuill,SPV3 Flood are FLIPPING HORRIFYING
24-07-2019T02:35:54,Bgrmystr2,it doesn't need to look for ways to torture me..
24-07-2019T02:36:06,Bgrmystr2,"yeah Ironically, that's what I'm troubleshooting, Quill"
24-07-2019T02:36:08,Bgrmystr2,SPV3.2
24-07-2019T02:36:13,CrimsonQuill,Oh crumbs
24-07-2019T02:36:16,CrimsonQuill,Well
24-07-2019T02:36:24,CrimsonQuill,I'm trying stuff on Heroic
24-07-2019T02:36:26,Bgrmystr2,which isn't going on the monitor I want nor is it centered on the screen
24-07-2019T02:36:36,CrimsonQuill,Not good
24-07-2019T02:36:45,Yevni,I'm debating taking a 28 inch 4k monitor with me
24-07-2019T02:36:51,Bgrmystr2,"I'm on the discord for SPV3 though, so I'll get it set up."
24-07-2019T02:36:52,Yevni,but I'm already packing so muchh
24-07-2019T02:36:58,Bgrmystr2,my GPU drivers might have been corrupt
24-07-2019T02:38:41,CrimsonQuill,Perhaps
24-07-2019T02:38:43,CrimsonQuill,Well
24-07-2019T02:38:47,CrimsonQuill,I need to shower
24-07-2019T02:38:52,CrimsonQuill,And study
24-07-2019T02:38:55,CrimsonQuill,Aaaah
24-07-2019T02:39:00,CrimsonQuill,Cya guys

24-07-2019T04:00:26,SniperJackal,@CrimsonQuill at least the jackal flood dont scream like they did in SPV3.1
24-07-2019T04:00:44,SniperJackal,That shit was annoying
24-07-2019T04:02:28,Bgrmystr2,oh thank fuck really
24-07-2019T04:02:38,Bgrmystr2,was it the lil crawly dudes
24-07-2019T04:02:44,Bgrmystr2,cuz those things screamed super loud
24-07-2019T04:35:48,CrimsonQuill,I have watched my fellow marines being turned into those monstrosities...
24-07-2019T04:35:55,CrimsonQuill,Thousands of infection forms...
24-07-2019T04:36:35,CrimsonQuill,but that was yesterday
24-07-2019T04:36:48,CrimsonQuill,Spatial Analysis and Geodetic Surveying are my lot now
24-07-2019T04:51:19,Bgrmystr2,I found something to help fullscreen Halo to my 2nd monitor
24-07-2019T04:51:25,Bgrmystr2,so I'm extremely happy
24-07-2019T04:59:20,CrimsonQuill,Lovely
24-07-2019T04:59:37,CrimsonQuill,I just poured myself a glass of lemon squash during my study break
24-07-2019T06:19:14,SniperJackal,"@Bgrmystr2 yeah they toned it town, they make noises like the other combat forms do"
24-07-2019T06:19:32,SniperJackal,the purring like noise
24-07-2019T06:19:40,SniperJackal,they dont screech anymore
24-07-2019T06:24:37,Bgrmystr2,"that's actually kinda sad, I actually liked the creepy screech, it was just too damn loud"
24-07-2019T06:24:57,Bgrmystr2,the clicking and screeching made it feel pretty horror
24-07-2019T06:25:10,Bgrmystr2,since most flood also had a screech-like sound
24-07-2019T06:25:14,SniperJackal,I gotta check again
24-07-2019T06:25:37,SniperJackal,they probably do have different sound but screeching isnt there
24-07-2019T10:44:52,AspiringNoodle,"I am back, and I will be gone again soon ;)"
24-07-2019T10:44:56,AspiringNoodle,Must get gas and food

24-07-2019T11:16:34,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s looking at me and I don’t like it https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/524825976597643265/603983786144825373/image0.jpg
24-07-2019T11:18:04,TerraTheWizard,wtf
24-07-2019T11:18:21,TerraTheWizard,also the description on the price sticker raises more questions
24-07-2019T11:19:55,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s a thrift store are you really surprised
24-07-2019T11:22:26,SpazztasticKiwi,also there’s a little boy old enough to use his own legs sitting in a buggy while mom looks for him a toy and he keeps “I don’t wanna toy mommy. I don’t like you mommy. Now get me a toy mommy”
24-07-2019T11:22:58,AspiringNoodle,Pretty kitty lady :ptv-hearts:
24-07-2019T11:23:11,SpazztasticKiwi,this kid was mine we’d be having a come to Jesus meeting

24-07-2019T12:04:11,AspiringNoodle,I think my impatience is finally catching up with me
24-07-2019T12:07:00,CrimsonQuill,Hiya
24-07-2019T12:07:08,CrimsonQuill,:ctwokinds-nibsbounce::ctwokinds-rainehappy:
24-07-2019T12:08:17,Orthonox,Hi Quill
24-07-2019T12:08:49,CrimsonQuill,Hi Orthonox
24-07-2019T12:11:31,Orthonox,How have you been? Have you started your day yet?
24-07-2019T12:11:39,CrimsonQuill,Cooked Dinner
24-07-2019T12:11:42,CrimsonQuill,SPAGHETTI
24-07-2019T12:11:46,CrimsonQuill,NYEH HEH HEH HEH
24-07-2019T12:11:52,CrimsonQuill,Everyone liked it
24-07-2019T12:13:54,AspiringNoodle,That sounds nice :3
24-07-2019T12:14:11,CrimsonQuill,Yep.
24-07-2019T12:14:16,CrimsonQuill,Lots of seasoning
24-07-2019T12:14:26,CrimsonQuill,And Herbes de Provence
24-07-2019T12:16:38,AspiringNoodle,I'm looking at computer hardware again :ptv-hearts:
24-07-2019T12:17:08,AspiringNoodle,"My power supply came yesterday, and I'm tired of waiting for 3 specific video cards to be for sale -_-"
24-07-2019T12:19:35,AspiringNoodle,Right now I'm comparing one specific video card in 2070 and 2080 super formats
24-07-2019T12:20:10,AspiringNoodle,"34.5% price increase for the latter, but performance is anywhere from 6 - 20% higher (so far), mostly around the 8-9% range, though"
24-07-2019T12:24:03,AspiringNoodle,"The, uh, super cards really dragged down the argument for choosing a 2080 over a 2070 ._."
24-07-2019T12:25:04,Orthonox,What are your standards for game performance? 1440p @60fps or higher?
24-07-2019T12:25:30,AspiringNoodle,"Yup, and I plan to hold onto my card for as long as possible :P"
24-07-2019T12:26:00,AspiringNoodle,Meaning I'll probably stick with it while game settings are at least 2 or 3 notches of max settings while maintaining 60fps
24-07-2019T12:26:06,AspiringNoodle,from*
24-07-2019T12:26:45,Orthonox,Cool. Do you typically play the latest games?
24-07-2019T12:27:46,AspiringNoodle,I'm planning to.  I've been wanting to switch to PC gaming for a while now :P
24-07-2019T12:27:59,AspiringNoodle,I do rather enjoy Apex Legends (even if I hated it at first)
24-07-2019T12:28:42,CrimsonQuill,My current ambition is to play Halo Infinite when it comes out.
24-07-2019T12:29:13,AspiringNoodle,I'm looking at WCCFTech's review for the Windforce cards from Gigabyte
24-07-2019T12:29:33,SpazztasticKiwi,raffle at this store had to ask if I’m 18
24-07-2019T12:29:39,SpazztasticKiwi,do I need a sign
24-07-2019T12:29:47,AspiringNoodle,The 2070 super is suuuuuuuper cool at 54C under gaming load and stock settings.  Bumps up to 56 with their OC
24-07-2019T12:29:49,CrimsonQuill,I don't know
24-07-2019T12:30:13,AspiringNoodle,Do you have grey hair yet? xD
24-07-2019T12:31:11,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m near 23 and people take me for 12
24-07-2019T12:31:29,Orthonox,"Oh, this is your first time looking into PC gaming? I thought you already play PC games but needed an upgrade."
24-07-2019T12:31:46,AspiringNoodle,For the most part I've played Blizzard titles
24-07-2019T12:31:51,AspiringNoodle,Those aren't exactly the most demanding
24-07-2019T12:32:51,Orthonox,Gotcha. How long have you been researching and what persuaded you to go PC gaming?
24-07-2019T12:33:18,AspiringNoodle,Convenience probably? lol
24-07-2019T12:33:36,AspiringNoodle,"I already sit on my ass in front of a computer most of the day, might as well game here instead of moving to play from a console ;)"
24-07-2019T12:34:20,AspiringNoodle,"Also, I do like mouse and keyboard for FPS games, and some less than stellar framerates on console games don't help either"
24-07-2019T12:34:32,AspiringNoodle,Ever play the original Dark Souls on console?
24-07-2019T12:34:55,Orthonox,No although I do have the game on my PC just waiting to be played.
24-07-2019T12:35:16,AspiringNoodle,There are sections of the game where it CHUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGS
24-07-2019T12:35:47,AspiringNoodle,Dark Souls was originally capped at 30 fps.  That was changed with the Scholar of the First Sin edition of Dark Souls 2 where they finally upped the cap to 60
24-07-2019T12:35:55,Orthonox,The original PC port of that game wasn't great either but it did had performance mods (DSfix) that fixed the problems.
24-07-2019T12:36:44,Orthonox,I did not know consoles had that problem. I thought that was a Demon Souls problem with the fluctuating frame rate.
24-07-2019T12:37:07,AspiringNoodle,It's one of the inherent dangers of consoles.  Days Gone is another good example
24-07-2019T12:37:18,CrimsonQuill,"No, Microsoft had some problems keeping consistent framerates in Halo 5 and in the MCC."
24-07-2019T12:37:30,AspiringNoodle,"It was designed with the PS4 Pro in mind, and so when it first launched, PS4 owners experienced issues with framerates during huge mob sequences"
24-07-2019T12:38:06,AspiringNoodle,PC is nicer in that you can pick and choose what settings get sacrificed for performance
24-07-2019T12:38:32,AspiringNoodle,"Also, I'll just leave this here: https://wccftech.com/review/gigabyte-geforce-rtx-2080-super-gaming-oc-graphics-card-review/9/"
24-07-2019T12:38:45,AspiringNoodle,ASUS apparently does have a god-tier air cooler
24-07-2019T12:38:48,AspiringNoodle,Them thermals
24-07-2019T12:40:41,Orthonox,I used to play console and have a PC machine now for many reasons. Both gaming and outside of gaming.
24-07-2019T12:42:32,AspiringNoodle,It's worth mentioning that my 1440p monitor is also a 144hz beast ;)
24-07-2019T12:42:39,AspiringNoodle,So it needs...
24-07-2019T12:42:42,AspiringNoodle,THE POWUUUUUUUUUUUUUH
24-07-2019T12:43:52,Orthonox,I need to experience higher than 60fps gameplay. I do not have a >120hz monitor.
24-07-2019T12:44:10,Orthonox,I do not plan on upgrading my PC until the new consoles come out.
24-07-2019T12:44:21,AspiringNoodle,"There is diminishing returns, but the experience will be more fluid"
24-07-2019T12:45:05,AspiringNoodle,"Personally, I can see a difference.  WoW is actually a good playground to test whether or not you can tell a difference between 60 vs 120 vs 240 fps"
24-07-2019T12:45:17,Orthonox,Oh I know. It was not a long time ago where I researched everything I could possibly know about PCs.
24-07-2019T12:45:35,AspiringNoodle,"With the right flying mount and a solid color backdrop, you can focus on the wings to see if you can identify the individual frames of the animation"
24-07-2019T12:46:20,AspiringNoodle,"Btw, the benchmarks worry me a tad"
24-07-2019T12:46:34,AspiringNoodle,The 2070 super from Gigabyte is setting nice and cool in the mid 50's (OC or not)
24-07-2019T12:46:47,AspiringNoodle,"But the 2080 super sits in the mid 60's, and then shoots up to the mid 70's with an OC D:"
24-07-2019T12:47:59,Orthonox,70C on a video card is perfectly okay.
24-07-2019T12:48:27,AspiringNoodle,"I know, it's the fact that lower temperatures also equates to longevity"
24-07-2019T12:49:59,Orthonox,"Yeah but it is not like 70C is going to kill the card in a few years. That's better than my used GTX 780, which hovers around 80C."
24-07-2019T12:50:36,Orthonox,Yet it is still kicking.
24-07-2019T12:50:47,Orthonox,Though I did apply new thermal paste to it.
24-07-2019T12:51:06,CrimsonQuill,Do you guys think Tom'll be here tonight?
24-07-2019T12:51:06,AspiringNoodle,My 970 (at least when my system wanted to use it) would be 80 - 83C under load
24-07-2019T12:51:25,AspiringNoodle,"But then again, it's an EVGA 970, and it turns out that they kinda dropped the ball on that one ^^;"
24-07-2019T12:51:59,Orthonox,"Today is Thursday, @CrimsonQuill. Is there any reason why he will be here tonight on this day?"
24-07-2019T12:52:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I have found a tiny kitchen set
24-07-2019T12:52:51,Orthonox,Are you talking about the coolers for the EVGA 970 or the fact that GTX 970s have 3.5GB of useable GDDR5 RAM?
24-07-2019T12:53:20,AspiringNoodle,EVGA's 970 in particular
24-07-2019T12:53:38,Orthonox,What's wrong with them?
24-07-2019T12:53:40,AspiringNoodle,"They made some mistakes with the cooler, so it's more or less the worst one in terms of cooling"
24-07-2019T12:53:47,Orthonox,Ah.
24-07-2019T12:54:02,CrimsonQuill,He might pop by to say hi
24-07-2019T12:54:04,AspiringNoodle,I'm able to OC my card to 1450Mhz tho :3
24-07-2019T12:54:10,CrimsonQuill,As he's back from SDCC
24-07-2019T12:54:19,Orthonox,"BRB, going to shower."
24-07-2019T12:54:25,AspiringNoodle,"That said, my current computer is a step above worst case, 1 intake, 1 exhaus, so not really the best for an air cooler"
24-07-2019T12:54:34,CrimsonQuill,Okeee Dokeeey Orthonoc
24-07-2019T12:54:39,CrimsonQuill,Orthonox
24-07-2019T13:35:35,Orthonox,I'm back!
24-07-2019T13:35:48,AspiringNoodle,As am I :)
24-07-2019T13:36:10,AspiringNoodle,"Also, missed my chance to get the card <3"
24-07-2019T13:38:10,SomeNiceUser,Maybe next time.
24-07-2019T13:38:28,SomeNiceUser,"Also, hi!"
24-07-2019T13:38:30,Orthonox,"When you do get your PC, do not get stress over if you cannot run the game at max settings. A lot of times, those settings (if optimized well) are made to run GPUs from the future."
24-07-2019T13:38:49,Orthonox,High settings can still look amazing.
24-07-2019T13:40:56,AspiringNoodle,Good things benchmarks use modern titles at max settings :p
24-07-2019T13:41:16,AspiringNoodle,"Right now Metro Exodus is the current ""Crysis"""
24-07-2019T13:44:40,AspiringNoodle,"Also, SERIOUSLY?!? We're on day 3 of 2080 super, and MSI/ASUS/Gigabyte still haven't put up their premium cards for sale :/"
24-07-2019T13:45:14,SomeNiceUser,Metro Exodus is now the current Crysis? How much does it take to run it?
24-07-2019T13:46:14,AspiringNoodle,"For some benchmarks at 1080p, it takes a 2080 or higher than get 60+ fps average"
24-07-2019T13:46:27,Orthonox,Depends on what you are trying to achieve in terms of settings. I doubt Noodle means it like 2007 Crysis where most people could not run the game period.
24-07-2019T13:46:45,AspiringNoodle,I do mean that ;)
24-07-2019T13:46:59,SomeNiceUser,"Yeah, Crysis was famous for that."
24-07-2019T13:47:09,Orthonox,Seriously? I gotta look this up.
24-07-2019T13:47:09,AspiringNoodle,"Because back then, you needed, what, the GT 8800 from Nvidia?  And that was to run max settings at 1600x900.  And you'd only get 45 fps"
24-07-2019T13:47:53,AspiringNoodle,"That said, I think these benchmarks that have the game struggling to run 60 fps at 1080p are probably using the global illumination setting"
24-07-2019T13:48:26,AspiringNoodle,"And if you turn that off, you could easily increase your fps 50%"
24-07-2019T13:49:28,AspiringNoodle,"For reference, there's 3 ways to use real-time raytracing in games"
24-07-2019T13:49:46,AspiringNoodle,"Reflections, Shadows, Global Illumination"
24-07-2019T13:49:52,AspiringNoodle,The last one is the most expensive to run
24-07-2019T13:50:38,CrimsonQuill,Must fry the computer
24-07-2019T13:50:50,SomeNiceUser,"Never knew that, I guess you learn something new everyday."
24-07-2019T13:51:10,AspiringNoodle,"It's just stupidly expensive to run, because it does all the lighting calculations through raytracing"
24-07-2019T13:58:01,SpazztasticKiwi,teen boy across the aisle just dead watching me like 👀
24-07-2019T13:58:16,AspiringNoodle,"It's funny.  When you look at benchmarks, % differences are tiny and are like, oh, that's not much more."
24-07-2019T13:58:20,Orthonox,"Looked up Metro benchmarks. If you turn off Ray Tracing, Nvidia GameWorks effects, and use medium settings on 1080p, most modern GPUs will run the game fairly well."
24-07-2019T13:58:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m in the ladies underthings section btw
24-07-2019T13:58:37,AspiringNoodle,"That's what I thought, they were using global illumination :/"
24-07-2019T13:59:20,Orthonox,"If you had mentioned ray tracing, I would not questioned most gpus not being able to run that because ray-tracing is freaking expensive to render."
24-07-2019T13:59:20,AspiringNoodle,"As for the actual numbers, when that % difference is, say, 15 - 20 more fps, you're like... ""Oh..."""
24-07-2019T13:59:44,AspiringNoodle,I did mention it after you left :p
24-07-2019T14:25:23,AspiringNoodle,...I think I'm gonna get a 3700x and cut my losses
24-07-2019T14:26:10,AspiringNoodle,There's no telling when the 3900x will be back in stock and for how long.  It pops up once every few days... for like 10 minutes.
24-07-2019T14:42:49,SpazztasticKiwi,so now Bindi irwin got engaged
24-07-2019T14:42:55,SpazztasticKiwi,on her birthday of course
24-07-2019T14:53:51,IronHorseComics,"oh yeah, forgot Steve had two kids instead of one"
24-07-2019T15:11:34,Orthonox,@AspiringNoodle Patience is a virtue my friend. Is there a reason why you need the 3900x in particular?
24-07-2019T15:12:04,AspiringNoodle,"Nah.  More or less if I wanted to spend $500 on a processor, I'd rather get the 4c/8t extra"
24-07-2019T15:13:00,AspiringNoodle,"And I want to reiterate, my current computer only has a 256GB ssd (237 usable) and cannot use gpus"
24-07-2019T15:13:23,AspiringNoodle,So it's not like I have a fully capable system in the meanwhile
24-07-2019T15:13:55,AspiringNoodle,Guess I'll sort out the fan / case situation in the meanwhile.  It's driving me nuts
24-07-2019T15:15:47,SpazztasticKiwi,there’s a condom wrapper at the McDonald’s drive thru
24-07-2019T15:16:16,CrimsonQuill,:ctwokinds-floAAA: I think we would all have rather not known that!

24-07-2019T15:18:09,CrimsonQuill,looks skittishly around and lowers voice
24-07-2019T15:18:30,CrimsonQuill,...bow-chicka-bow-wow...
24-07-2019T15:18:39,CrimsonQuill,As Tucker says
24-07-2019T15:20:16,AspiringNoodle,"Okay, I'm an awful person :ptv-laugh:"
24-07-2019T15:20:38,AspiringNoodle,I'm just gonna keep this joke to myself
24-07-2019T15:20:45,CrimsonQuill,:ctwokinds-daydreamingkat:
24-07-2019T15:23:45,SpazztasticKiwi,told the manager lady and she just looked so damn done
24-07-2019T15:25:10,AspiringNoodle,I'm so damn done with rgb ;)
24-07-2019T15:25:46,AspiringNoodle,I've reached the point where I won't bother going the extra mile in effort (and cash) to coordinate things like fans within a build.
24-07-2019T15:26:17,AspiringNoodle,"Mobo, GPU, RAM, cpu cooler, that's fine, just need software"
24-07-2019T15:27:24,AspiringNoodle,"Long story short: If it ends up adding extra hardware / cable management into the build just to get aesthetics and rgb functionality synced, fuck it <3"
24-07-2019T15:30:00,CrimsonQuill,Oh dear
24-07-2019T15:31:27,IronHorseComics,"and I'm done with the Ducktales remaster for a while, whole lotta bullshit in the final boss"
24-07-2019T15:35:14,AspiringNoodle,Here's one reason why I'm fed up with RGB before I've even attempted making a build
24-07-2019T15:36:15,AspiringNoodle,"Why, and I'm being serious here, do they almost always have the front fans for the case be addressable rgb, but then the rear exhaust fan is just a solid black.  And keep in mind these cases also usually have a side window. Acrylic, glass, or otherwise."
24-07-2019T15:41:15,AspiringNoodle,"Correction, it seems to be Corsair / Cooler Master who love doing RGB front plain black back :/"
24-07-2019T15:48:50,Orthonox,You talking about RGB LEDs?
24-07-2019T15:49:21,AspiringNoodle,"cases and the included fans, lol"
24-07-2019T15:50:03,AspiringNoodle,"It makes no sense to me to have RGB fans in the front be on full display, then have a plain-af black / white / grey fan for the exhaust, sitting in plain view of the side window"
24-07-2019T15:50:34,IronHorseComics,*looks at the RGB fans on the front of my case* I like 'em
24-07-2019T15:51:55,AspiringNoodle,Can you see an exhaust fan from the side?
24-07-2019T15:52:22,AspiringNoodle,"Given the components I'm about to buy, my computer is going to have an open side panel so I can see everything :3"
24-07-2019T15:52:31,IronHorseComics,"yes, but they don't have RGB lights on them"
24-07-2019T15:52:39,IronHorseComics,only the ones on the front do
24-07-2019T15:53:20,AspiringNoodle,Doesn't it seem a bit weird to have the back be so plain looking?
24-07-2019T15:53:53,IronHorseComics,"no, the backs facing the wall so there's no point to it"
24-07-2019T15:54:48,AspiringNoodle,"Okay, we're on entirely different levels"
24-07-2019T15:55:23,AspiringNoodle,I'm talking about cases that have see-through side panels so you can see everything inside the case
24-07-2019T16:01:58,AspiringNoodle,Maybe I'm overthinking this
24-07-2019T16:02:00,AspiringNoodle,I tend to do that :/
24-07-2019T16:03:47,IronHorseComics,you are
24-07-2019T16:06:08,SpazztasticKiwi,*have been
24-07-2019T16:33:36,Orthonox,I find RGB LEDs tacky to say the least.
24-07-2019T16:37:56,Bgrmystr2,"RGB can be cool, but it needs to be done properly, not just shine stupidly randomly"
24-07-2019T16:38:35,Bgrmystr2,"Keyboards are a great example of how it's done right. The color flows from one side of the keyboard to the other in a wave, it's not crazy all sorts of colors at the same time."
24-07-2019T16:39:13,Bgrmystr2,"Inside your system case is a completely different story, everything's on a totally different point of the rainbow loop, and it just looks bad."
24-07-2019T16:42:45,Bgrmystr2,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/353368103582826499/604065693885005885/Rainbow_Filter.gif I'm pretty sure this is an example you can slow down and also increase the size of each color in the wave so it's less flashy
24-07-2019T16:42:49,Bgrmystr2,also aaalink
24-07-2019T16:43:34,Bgrmystr2,it's something you can control to make it viable.
24-07-2019T16:44:13,Bgrmystr2,RGB computer internals though... :ptv-RainbowThrowup:
24-07-2019T16:44:34,horoisawolf,"oh god, is that keyboard on LSD?"
24-07-2019T16:44:43,Bgrmystr2,haha maybe.
24-07-2019T16:45:31,BluePhantom90,God today is a great day. My sketch idea got drawn and it looks amazing
24-07-2019T16:47:27,horoisawolf,Keyboard is waay to flashy and agitated to be useds as an input-device. would distract me from the screen...
24-07-2019T16:48:26,Bgrmystr2,yeah that's why I'm sayin slow it down
24-07-2019T16:48:32,Bgrmystr2,and make the waves larger
24-07-2019T16:48:40,Bgrmystr2,so it's more of a nice smooth transition
24-07-2019T16:49:24,Bgrmystr2,..and I need to redownload discord. It crashed and is doing an update loop. Again.
24-07-2019T16:58:05,Orthonox,@BluePhantom90 I'm glad Tom picked your sketch idea and he put a great amount of detail into it. I hope it wins a color vote.
24-07-2019T17:00:12,Orthonox,@Brgmystr2 The RGB on a keyboard looks cool and Corsai does a great job adding customizable options.
24-07-2019T17:00:50,Orthonox,@Bgrmystr2 I just know myself enough to know that I will turn it off at some point and never bother to turn it back on again.
24-07-2019T17:00:58,Bgrmystr2,xD
24-07-2019T17:02:09,SomeNiceUser,That sketch looks really nice.
24-07-2019T17:06:46,SomeNiceUser,hides in the dark corner of the room due to running out of topic to talk about.
24-07-2019T17:12:24,IronHorseComics,indeed
24-07-2019T17:12:29,SomeNiceUser,I really want
24-07-2019T17:12:53,SomeNiceUser,I sent a thing without thinking
24-07-2019T17:13:49,SomeNiceUser,So... How is everyone?
24-07-2019T17:18:22,SomeNiceUser,I should really focus on writing down ideas.
24-07-2019T17:18:24,IronHorseComics,"better than I was today, did not have a good day at work"
24-07-2019T17:19:05,SomeNiceUser,Oh.
24-07-2019T17:20:09,SomeNiceUser,I dropped my phone and it did a cartwheel before it fell of my bed.
24-07-2019T17:20:31,Bgrmystr2,Did it take any damage when falling on the floor?
24-07-2019T17:21:44,SomeNiceUser,"It is minimal, just a small crack."
24-07-2019T17:22:03,SomeNiceUser,"Not to the screen, on the back."

24-07-2019T17:23:39,Bgrmystr2,"xD ""NO CRACKS!"" he says."

24-07-2019T17:25:10,Bgrmystr2,"otherwise, it'd be an 8."
24-07-2019T17:25:34,IronHorseComics,so that this mean the Russian guy's the 6?
24-07-2019T17:25:42,IronHorseComics,*so does
24-07-2019T17:25:50,Bgrmystr2,Probably. Kids in russia could have eaten that phone.
24-07-2019T17:25:56,Bgrmystr2,and here you are dropping it on the ground :v
24-07-2019T17:26:14,IronHorseComics,"""I'm distributing your points comrade"""

24-07-2019T17:31:30,SomeNiceUser,So I’m a regular there.
24-07-2019T17:31:39,SomeNiceUser,Lol
24-07-2019T17:47:44,Orthonox,I'm doing well SomeNiceUser. May I call you SNC for short?

24-07-2019T17:48:55,Orthonox,Darn it. I meant SNU.
24-07-2019T18:04:17,SpazztasticKiwi,anyone see the dick appointment challenge on twitter
24-07-2019T18:08:22,SpazztasticKiwi,when you think they can’t do anything different it happens
24-07-2019T18:10:00,Bgrmystr2,that's par for the course
24-07-2019T18:10:21,Bgrmystr2,who's got it stuck in the fan due to unclear instructions this time?
24-07-2019T18:11:21,SpazztasticKiwi,as entertaining and unsurprising that kind of thing is it was a challenge where ladies were texting their men for a dick appointment and screenshoting the responses
24-07-2019T18:12:03,SpazztasticKiwi,one lady said she hit send and her husband was in the room with her before the door even managed closed behind him

24-07-2019T18:28:38,SpazztasticKiwi,something I saw that made my crotch catch fire: the other day we tried food in the bedroom

24-07-2019T18:32:25,AspiringNoodle,You're SUPPOSED to have some kind of control software to coordinate everything.
24-07-2019T18:32:43,Bgrmystr2,supposed to.
24-07-2019T18:32:49,Bgrmystr2,but since everyone has their own software
24-07-2019T18:32:51,Bgrmystr2,you really can't.

24-07-2019T18:33:53,Bgrmystr2,there's a reason why the whole rainbow filter is popular.
24-07-2019T18:35:18,IronHorseComics,it's pretty?

24-07-2019T19:14:09,CrRAR,I was hoping it was not that tragic.
24-07-2019T19:14:40,CrRAR,He REALLY wanted that one unchopped strawberry swirling about.
24-07-2019T19:14:48,Bgrmystr2,BZZZZZZT prettymuch
24-07-2019T19:15:47,SpazztasticKiwi,actually he was washing the parts and that’s how it got him

24-07-2019T19:18:42,CrRAR,"I smell a lawsuit,"
24-07-2019T19:19:03,IronHorseComics,it's one of those wall vaccumes where you hook a hose to the wall and the head was detachable. Always hated that thing
24-07-2019T19:19:07,CrRAR,Wait did he just squeeze the blade too hard?
24-07-2019T19:19:29,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s probably soapy
24-07-2019T19:19:42,SpazztasticKiwi,slippy + sharp don’t mix
24-07-2019T19:19:45,CrRAR,Like a central vac attachment iron?
24-07-2019T19:19:58,CrRAR,yeah no bueno spazz.
24-07-2019T19:20:32,IronHorseComics,yeah except it was bulky
24-07-2019T19:21:09,IronHorseComics,much more so than the ones of today
24-07-2019T19:24:06,CrRAR,I know some of those are fancy with metal heads
24-07-2019T19:24:21,CrRAR,sucks
24-07-2019T19:24:29,CrRAR,i know
24-07-2019T19:24:34,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-keith8D:
24-07-2019T19:25:15,IronHorseComics,sucks more than a regular vaccume that's for sure
24-07-2019T19:25:50,SpazztasticKiwi,oh and dude from work proposed Netflix and chill
24-07-2019T19:26:10,SpazztasticKiwi,only 10% sure he was joking
24-07-2019T19:26:19,SpazztasticKiwi,still said no
24-07-2019T19:26:45,CrRAR,jeez lol
24-07-2019T19:27:00,SomeNiceUser,comes back with ice cream.
24-07-2019T19:27:25,AspiringNoodle,I had ice cream. Just finished it :D
24-07-2019T19:27:47,CrRAR,amazing
24-07-2019T19:27:53,SomeNiceUser,I gave some to my dog.
24-07-2019T19:28:06,SomeNiceUser,He licked the bowl cl an.
24-07-2019T19:28:27,SomeNiceUser,It seems that the e has been stolen.
24-07-2019T19:28:32,SpazztasticKiwi,dogs aren’t supposed to have dairy
24-07-2019T19:28:51,SomeNiceUser,Only small portions are ok.
24-07-2019T19:29:07,IronHorseComics,"you know, I bet I know what Tom got for his birthday... the ability to give his Mike poster to Danny from Game Grumps"
24-07-2019T19:29:12,SpazztasticKiwi,it builds up just make sure there’s no chocolate
24-07-2019T19:29:14,IronHorseComics,off topic I know
24-07-2019T19:29:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom watches Danny
24-07-2019T19:29:39,SpazztasticKiwi,since when
24-07-2019T19:29:44,CrRAR,lol
24-07-2019T19:29:56,SomeNiceUser,Chocolate is very bad for dogs.
24-07-2019T19:30:08,CrRAR,They're pretty unavoidable if you even game the TINIEST bit.
24-07-2019T19:30:26,CrRAR,I think Tom mentioned he met one of them once.
24-07-2019T19:30:36,IronHorseComics,plus there's a joke that Danny's a furry
24-07-2019T19:30:40,Bgrmystr2,Wish doggos could eat chocolate
24-07-2019T19:30:44,SpazztasticKiwi,and I’d say giving a Mike poster to Danny might be weird but he has called himself Danny Sexbang so
24-07-2019T19:30:47,Bgrmystr2,it's so good
24-07-2019T19:30:51,CrRAR,lol
24-07-2019T19:30:56,SpazztasticKiwi,there’s jokes Seáns a furry
24-07-2019T19:31:15,SomeNiceUser,Furry jokes are furry.
24-07-2019T19:31:26,Bgrmystr2,does it matter if he is..?
24-07-2019T19:31:31,IronHorseComics,eeehhh I never saw that from Jacksepticeye
24-07-2019T19:31:32,CrRAR,I love the wide-eyed excited look dogs get when they get sweet treats.
24-07-2019T19:31:55,SomeNiceUser,I do too!
24-07-2019T19:32:06,SpazztasticKiwi,if you mean met one of the grumps it’d be either Danny or Aron
24-07-2019T19:32:16,SomeNiceUser,It’s heart warming...
24-07-2019T19:32:38,CrRAR,yis
24-07-2019T19:32:56,SpazztasticKiwi,though here’s been a livestream where Mark showed Tom to Bob and Wade
24-07-2019T19:33:08,SpazztasticKiwi,maybe that’s who he meant he met
24-07-2019T19:33:32,AspiringNoodle,If you give sweets to a Samoyed
24-07-2019T19:33:45,AspiringNoodle,Do they turn into a literal marshmallow? :ptv-wondering:
24-07-2019T19:34:00,SomeNiceUser,Question of the century.
24-07-2019T19:35:18,SpazztasticKiwi,if you’ve seen Lucy you’d know they’re already marshmallows
24-07-2019T19:36:25,CrRAR,Marshmallow 2: Marshmalloier
24-07-2019T19:37:45,CrRAR,Someone get Bill Nye on it. He's got plenty of free time.
24-07-2019T19:37:51,Sclimshady,What if you made Rice krispie treats out of lucky charms marshmallows?
24-07-2019T19:38:10,CrRAR,Like mixed in?
24-07-2019T19:38:24,CrRAR,OR ALL lucky charms?
24-07-2019T19:38:44,IronHorseComics,they already have
24-07-2019T19:38:57,Sclimshady,WHAT!?
24-07-2019T19:39:05,Sclimshady,Where do I buy?
24-07-2019T19:39:14,CrRAR,"You wouldn't just TASTE the rainbow, you BECOME the rainbow."
24-07-2019T19:39:18,IronHorseComics,well I thought they officially made one
24-07-2019T19:39:31,IronHorseComics,but there are recipes online for it
24-07-2019T19:40:09,IronHorseComics,"which is odd, I could have sworn I've seen them at Walmart in the past"
24-07-2019T19:40:21,CrRAR,Maybe a special edition
24-07-2019T19:40:47,Sclimshady,I could probably do it if i mixed the melted marsh goo into the lucky charms off the burner so they wouldnt dissolve
24-07-2019T19:41:47,SpazztasticKiwi,“Bagheera don’t do that you’re gonna fall. Bagheera don-“ Bagheera: *falls*
24-07-2019T19:41:54,CrRAR,lol
24-07-2019T19:42:06,CrRAR,It's just his routine
24-07-2019T19:42:10,SpazztasticKiwi,and he’s got the nerve to look at me like it’s my fault
24-07-2019T19:42:26,CrRAR,haha

24-07-2019T19:43:07,SpazztasticKiwi,I was three feet away at the microwave
24-07-2019T19:43:22,CrRAR,haha
24-07-2019T19:43:40,CrRAR,Did he slide off something per the usual?
24-07-2019T19:44:07,SpazztasticKiwi,the chair arm
24-07-2019T19:44:35,CrRAR,Maybe the delicious food smells interfere with his mental abilities.
24-07-2019T19:44:52,SpazztasticKiwi,it was a pasta cup
24-07-2019T19:44:59,SpazztasticKiwi,boiling noodles
24-07-2019T19:45:14,CrRAR,That could smell trippy to a cat
24-07-2019T19:45:23,CrRAR,you never really KNOW
24-07-2019T19:45:27,CrRAR,lol
24-07-2019T19:45:44,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m pretty sure he’s just trippy on his own
24-07-2019T19:45:51,CrRAR,hahaha
24-07-2019T19:46:26,SpazztasticKiwi,for example I clean the bathroom and his litterbox
24-07-2019T19:46:43,SpazztasticKiwi,and now he wants to lay in the litterbox
24-07-2019T19:46:55,SpazztasticKiwi,so I guess I cleaned it too good
24-07-2019T19:47:17,CrRAR,lol
24-07-2019T19:47:29,CrRAR,but also ew
24-07-2019T19:59:37,AspiringNoodle,hmmm

24-07-2019T20:04:37,SpazztasticKiwi,how come dispite how bad it hurts guys will laugh at each other cracking themselves in the crotch
24-07-2019T20:06:06,AspiringNoodle,"Comedy, at its heart, is about laughing at other people's misfortunes :)"
24-07-2019T20:06:31,IronHorseComics,and often we know that pain
24-07-2019T20:06:51,IronHorseComics,or at least a small piece of it
24-07-2019T20:09:09,SpazztasticKiwi,half of me is like can I laugh should I laugh and are you ok
24-07-2019T20:09:17,SpazztasticKiwi,as ridiculous as that question is
24-07-2019T20:09:50,SpazztasticKiwi,cause most of em are laying on the floor in pain like they’ve had their intestines pulled out
24-07-2019T20:10:27,AspiringNoodle,"Oh, believe us, it hurts like hell"
24-07-2019T20:10:31,AspiringNoodle,But it's still funny ;D
24-07-2019T20:10:32,Bgrmystr2,"the one with 3 fans will have more sheer airflow, noodle"
24-07-2019T20:10:44,Bgrmystr2,whether that translates into better cooling is debatable
24-07-2019T20:10:47,CrRAR,It's how bros console each other.
24-07-2019T20:11:00,CrRAR,With cacophonous laughter.
24-07-2019T20:11:04,AspiringNoodle,"Bgr, if that's the case, I might have one that could make it easier to choose"
24-07-2019T20:11:04,SpazztasticKiwi,“you’re in pain allow me to laugh”
24-07-2019T20:11:09,SpazztasticKiwi,solid logic
24-07-2019T20:11:46,CrRAR,Sometimes it even makes the sufferer laugh too!
24-07-2019T20:11:47,IronHorseComics,"""laugh the pain off bro"""
24-07-2019T20:11:52,CrRAR,(and cry)
24-07-2019T20:12:14,CrRAR,(very deep and sobby cries)
24-07-2019T20:12:19,AspiringNoodle,Extra points if their voice goes up a few octaves
24-07-2019T20:12:23,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-laugh:
24-07-2019T20:12:25,CrRAR,lol
24-07-2019T20:13:38,CrRAR,If you happen to pass out from the pain you'll most likely wake up sharpied on.
24-07-2019T20:13:44,CrRAR,So don't do that.
24-07-2019T20:13:56,SpazztasticKiwi,suddenly soprano
24-07-2019T20:13:57,CrRAR,It's like modern-day natural selection.
24-07-2019T20:14:12,AspiringNoodle,Like that guy who went for the world record
24-07-2019T20:14:15,SpazztasticKiwi,how do you honestly hit yourself hard enough to pass out
24-07-2019T20:14:17,AspiringNoodle,"""Most times kicked in the nuts in a row"""
24-07-2019T20:14:29,AspiringNoodle,Don't think they should be allowed to breed
24-07-2019T20:14:38,CrRAR,"""You sir... are NOT a winner"""
24-07-2019T20:14:40,SpazztasticKiwi,oh wasn’t there a guy that paid people to do that for a “prank” video
24-07-2019T20:14:56,Bgrmystr2,"I don't exactly have experience with water cooling, but I do know it's not TOO different when it comes to the radiator itself. The amount of air you can push through the radiator going to help drop the temperature."
24-07-2019T20:15:22,SpazztasticKiwi,well theoretically if he doesn’t lose his breeding ability he’ll be too sore to copulate for awhile
24-07-2019T20:15:22,CrRAR,Yeah the 3 fan layout is niiice
24-07-2019T20:15:36,AspiringNoodle,https://www.newegg.com/satin-black-phanteks-evolv-x-atx-mid-tower/p/N82E16811854078

24-07-2019T20:15:53,Bgrmystr2,and three fans at 1600 is more than two fans at 2000. 4800 > 4000

24-07-2019T20:16:20,AspiringNoodle,And then I could get another ML120 fan for the exhaust :D
24-07-2019T20:16:21,Bgrmystr2,"but if airflow was all it is, you'd just be looking at an air cooler"
24-07-2019T20:16:31,Bgrmystr2,there's a lot more to it to the liquid cooling systems
24-07-2019T20:16:53,AspiringNoodle,Cons of air coolers: They're big.
24-07-2019T20:17:01,Bgrmystr2,"what liquids, the build quality, the connections, etc"
24-07-2019T20:17:17,Bgrmystr2,all the stuff in between the block and the radiator matter too
24-07-2019T20:17:34,SpazztasticKiwi,one of the few moments that she wants to but he’s not in the mood
24-07-2019T20:17:43,SpazztasticKiwi,oh how the tables turn
24-07-2019T20:18:14,CrRAR,curses
24-07-2019T20:19:04,Bgrmystr2,"Kiwi, watching people do dumb things is usually silly and comedy"

24-07-2019T20:19:25,Bgrmystr2,"but watching that, specifically usually just makes you go ""ow, I felt that and it didn't even happen to me"""
24-07-2019T20:19:58,Bgrmystr2,"some people just don't care about the misfortune of others, so they laugh without bothering to care, but that just makes them bad people"
24-07-2019T20:20:01,Bgrmystr2,so we don't speak of them :)
24-07-2019T20:27:47,SpazztasticKiwi,then there’s the oh that had to hurt cringe
24-07-2019T20:28:01,SpazztasticKiwi,like your body’s trying to cave in from the horror
24-07-2019T20:28:46,SpazztasticKiwi,which makes me think of the “brilliant” idea of a video I watched yesterday about first kisses in slow motion
24-07-2019T20:29:08,SpazztasticKiwi,3 couples. Their first kiss. Slow motion. And no they’ve never met before that
24-07-2019T20:38:09,ZahnHolley,Hello did I miss the stream again?
24-07-2019T20:38:23,Bgrmystr2,no
24-07-2019T20:38:27,Bgrmystr2,there was no stream
24-07-2019T20:38:37,Bgrmystr2,people are always here
24-07-2019T20:39:36,ZahnHolley,usually Tom shows up when people are active.
24-07-2019T20:39:43,Bgrmystr2,not really
24-07-2019T20:39:47,Bgrmystr2,he shows up regardless lol
24-07-2019T20:42:36,ZahnHolley,that figures... I’m happy that I didn’t miss out on his stream.
24-07-2019T20:43:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Toms been off for days now
24-07-2019T20:44:08,SpazztasticKiwi,with those conventions back to back he may have taken a rest
24-07-2019T20:44:21,Bgrmystr2,it's not likely for him to have streamed anyway since he just came back from a convention.
24-07-2019T20:44:31,ZahnHolley,He must be very busy this summer.
24-07-2019T20:44:50,Bgrmystr2,"this month, maybe"
24-07-2019T20:47:40,Orthonox,I think the guy deserves some rest. He's done a lot.
24-07-2019T20:47:43,SpazztasticKiwi,he always busy
24-07-2019T20:49:51,ZahnHolley,Did you guys commission him at comic con?
24-07-2019T20:50:28,Bgrmystr2,"I didn't go, who the fuck has enough money for that lol"
24-07-2019T20:51:48,ZahnHolley,Idk know... I was just guessing if he was open for commission?
24-07-2019T20:51:51,IronHorseComics,and why would I want to go to San Diego when Atlanta is just two hours drive south of me?
24-07-2019T20:51:51,Bgrmystr2,"long ass drive, expensive hotel, long stay, expensive convention tickets.. if they aren't already sold out within 4 mins."
24-07-2019T20:52:12,SpazztasticKiwi,oh you know I wonder how it’s gonna go for him since Mark said he’s going with their mom to Korea September
24-07-2019T20:52:20,Bgrmystr2,"Tom doesn't go to to Atlanta so I'm pretty sure that point is moot,  Iron"
24-07-2019T20:52:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Toms gonna have the dogs and work to himself
24-07-2019T20:52:33,Bgrmystr2,the convention he goes to is in San Diego.
24-07-2019T20:52:49,SpazztasticKiwi,I wish he’d go to Atlanta
24-07-2019T20:52:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Or PAX
24-07-2019T20:53:03,Bgrmystr2,it'd be closer to me in Atlanta for sure
24-07-2019T20:53:10,Bgrmystr2,but still quite a drive.
24-07-2019T20:53:15,SpazztasticKiwi,only 3 hours here
24-07-2019T20:53:33,IronHorseComics,"2 hours, same would be if he went to Nashville"
24-07-2019T20:53:40,IronHorseComics,or Knoxville (ew)
24-07-2019T20:53:55,Ordithus,"All these places, it would be faster for me to just crash his house"
24-07-2019T20:53:55,ZahnHolley,That’s a long ass drive.
24-07-2019T20:54:12,Bgrmystr2,"Probably a good 10 or 12 hours from here I think, according to a friend of mine who evacuated there during Katrina"
24-07-2019T20:54:21,Ordithus,But then he'd call the po-po :ctwokinds-keifacepalm:
24-07-2019T20:54:31,SpazztasticKiwi,If he lived
24-07-2019T20:54:33,Bgrmystr2,haha
24-07-2019T20:54:46,SpazztasticKiwi,you know provided you didn’t run him over
24-07-2019T20:55:01,Ordithus,"As in party crash, not literal, car crash"
24-07-2019T20:55:06,Ordithus,Jeez
24-07-2019T20:55:06,IronHorseComics,little known fact is that Tom has a dragon mount
24-07-2019T20:55:28,SpazztasticKiwi,what proces your a fan more than to literally drive through their house
24-07-2019T20:55:32,SpazztasticKiwi,proves
