18-07-2019T08:12:25,AspiringNoodle,"And the intro of this game has some rather prominent voice acting that he CAN'T talk over.  So every time there's a millisecond of a pause, he tries to speak only for the dialogue to continue"
18-07-2019T08:13:19,AspiringNoodle,"Meanwhile, I'm sitting here thinking, ""This game is getting payback for every damned youtube who talks over crucial dialogues or cutscenes every time they play a game ;)"""

18-07-2019T17:06:21,SpazztasticKiwi,couple just showed up with they kids and stay in the car with AC while they play on the swings
18-07-2019T17:12:48,TeapotOfDoom,10/10 would parent again
18-07-2019T17:16:26,AspiringNoodle,It's hell where I live at the moment
18-07-2019T17:16:31,AspiringNoodle,10/10 would force them out of the car :p

18-07-2019T17:26:12,SpazztasticKiwi,funny how you assume they may actually be watching them
18-07-2019T17:26:17,AspiringNoodle,But it feels more like an oven than refreshing :p

18-07-2019T17:28:21,SpazztasticKiwi,‚Äúsos a volcano. do us a favor and take a walk‚Äù
18-07-2019T17:29:17,TeapotOfDoom,Can someone tell me what 97F means in layman terms?
18-07-2019T17:29:33,TeapotOfDoom,Which means in C?
18-07-2019T17:29:42,TeapotOfDoom,(Or c++)
18-07-2019T17:31:54,IronHorseComics,36
18-07-2019T17:32:23,TeapotOfDoom,Aw that's hot. That's hot
18-07-2019T17:32:57,IronHorseComics,"it's an average day in July and August down here, to make it worse it's humid as balls"
18-07-2019T17:34:18,TeapotOfDoom,If you'd know what i was talking aboud i'd say you probably feel like a Rollbraten
18-07-2019T17:34:58,TeapotOfDoom,Oh i know the translation
18-07-2019T17:35:07,TeapotOfDoom,Steamed hams
18-07-2019T17:35:16,IronHorseComics,sounds about right
18-07-2019T17:35:48,TeapotOfDoom,That joke was actually not intentional
18-07-2019T17:35:57,IronHorseComics,lol
18-07-2019T17:37:12,IronHorseComics,"I know a guy who was once talking about meat sweats, he actually was talking about steamed food but we kept making...jokes..."

18-07-2019T17:43:09,SpazztasticKiwi,my faith in humanity just dropped a few 100 pts

18-07-2019T17:43:24,SpazztasticKiwi,boy in McDonald‚Äôs doin sneak vape tricks in his cup

18-07-2019T17:44:41,SpazztasticKiwi,nah everything changed when the hormones attacked
18-07-2019T17:44:54,TeapotOfDoom,Sounds about right
18-07-2019T17:45:46,SpazztasticKiwi,now he‚Äôs bragging about his arms being rock solid
18-07-2019T17:45:58,TeapotOfDoom,Hahaha
18-07-2019T17:46:04,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm sitting here thinkin ‚Äúonly rock on you is in your head‚Äù
18-07-2019T17:46:11,IronHorseComics,"I once had to do a quick sign at the sign company I work at, slimeball asked my boss if he could vape in the office and the moron said ""Sure go ahead"" and the client proceeded to vape directly behind me while hovering over me as I worked on his thing"
18-07-2019T17:46:43,TeapotOfDoom,Nice
18-07-2019T17:47:02,IronHorseComics,it infuriated me so much
18-07-2019T17:47:14,SpazztasticKiwi,if I tell you or if you‚Äôre told no smoking (yes that includes vaping) I will deduce you are on fit and act appropriately
18-07-2019T17:47:44,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúCommere‚ÄùüßØ
18-07-2019T17:47:48,IronHorseComics,I'm more pissed at my boss for telling him it was okay when it clearly wasn't
18-07-2019T17:48:23,IronHorseComics,of course that boss has always been the most idiotic person I've ever met
18-07-2019T17:48:33,SpazztasticKiwi,new laws supposed to make it illegal to smoke within 10-20 feet of any open vessel of a building
18-07-2019T17:48:45,TeapotOfDoom,There seems to be no actual word in English for what I'm trying to say
18-07-2019T17:48:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Walmart just straight up put a no smoking or vape
18-07-2019T17:49:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Utensils in the store
18-07-2019T17:49:14,SpazztasticKiwi,sign
18-07-2019T17:49:35,TeapotOfDoom,In German we have a word for something called R√ºcksichtname
18-07-2019T17:49:46,TeapotOfDoom,Or just R√ºcksicht
18-07-2019T17:49:59,Bgrmystr2,"isn't vaping using illegal drugs anyway, so that's kinda pointless of walmart lol"
18-07-2019T17:50:00,SpazztasticKiwi,does it roughly translate to ‚Äúdipshit‚Äù
18-07-2019T17:50:08,Bgrmystr2,also hi
18-07-2019T17:50:14,SpazztasticKiwi,wasssaaaap
18-07-2019T17:50:15,IronHorseComics,hi there
18-07-2019T17:50:21,Bgrmystr2,and hot damn that kat from the latest image
18-07-2019T17:50:29,TeapotOfDoom,It means considering how ones actions might influence others and if they would be happy
18-07-2019T17:50:43,Bgrmystr2,her hairstyle is gorgeous in the new art design
18-07-2019T17:50:47,SpazztasticKiwi,yeah lots of people were smoking near the doors. Of course there‚Äôs always one every blue moon trying to bring it in
18-07-2019T17:50:47,TeapotOfDoom,Hi bgr
18-07-2019T17:51:06,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-SteelwormHades:
18-07-2019T17:51:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Then you got the ‚Äúit‚Äôs not smoke it‚Äôs water vapor‚Äù tools
18-07-2019T17:51:19,SpazztasticKiwi,So now they say keep it out or get arrested
18-07-2019T17:51:29,TeapotOfDoom,That's just so r√ºcksichtslos
18-07-2019T17:51:52,IronHorseComics,"so basically teapot, considerate or inconsiderate"
18-07-2019T17:52:12,TeapotOfDoom,R√ºcksicht = considerate
18-07-2019T17:52:25,TeapotOfDoom,R√ºcksichtslos = the opposite
18-07-2019T17:52:35,IronHorseComics,which is inconsiderate
18-07-2019T17:52:43,TeapotOfDoom,But i dunno if it has the same weight to it
18-07-2019T17:52:48,TeapotOfDoom,Jep
18-07-2019T17:52:57,SpazztasticKiwi,German: add a smattering of letters at the end to make antonyms
18-07-2019T17:53:03,IronHorseComics,"no, it doesn't. Considerate is too polite"
18-07-2019T17:53:33,TeapotOfDoom,If someone is r√ºcksichtsvoll that's quite the compliment
18-07-2019T17:53:39,SpazztasticKiwi,r√ºcksicht = Canadian
18-07-2019T17:53:49,TeapotOfDoom,My language tends to get a bit complicated
18-07-2019T17:54:01,SpazztasticKiwi,studying bits of it
18-07-2019T17:54:03,TeapotOfDoom,Can confirm spazz
18-07-2019T17:54:21,IronHorseComics,"no no, Kiwi, that's Danish"
18-07-2019T17:54:24,TeapotOfDoom,Nice. How far have you gotten? Hit me!
18-07-2019T17:54:44,IronHorseComics,Danish is the language throwing letters together incomprehensively
18-07-2019T17:54:45,SpazztasticKiwi,*smack*
18-07-2019T17:54:52,SpazztasticKiwi,for the record he asked for it
18-07-2019T17:54:57,IronHorseComics,that he did
18-07-2019T17:55:06,TeapotOfDoom,rolls over
18-07-2019T17:55:18,SpazztasticKiwi,bruh
18-07-2019T17:55:26,TeapotOfDoom,That's not what i meant
18-07-2019T17:55:26,SpazztasticKiwi,This dude just called his mom a hoe
18-07-2019T17:55:44,IronHorseComics,"right, time to punch him in the face"
18-07-2019T17:55:57,TeapotOfDoom,*Bruh sound effect 2*
18-07-2019T17:56:00,SpazztasticKiwi,you‚Äôre welcome to hop over here
18-07-2019T17:56:15,TeapotOfDoom,starts hopping
18-07-2019T17:56:22,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúI‚Äôm about to get a new mommy‚Äù someone send help
18-07-2019T17:56:54,TeapotOfDoom,* Bruh sound effect 2 intensifies*
18-07-2019T17:57:21,SpazztasticKiwi,this reminds me why I wanna try some older dates
18-07-2019T17:58:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"I may have a bit of Nora mentality on this but ‚ÄúI like my men like I like my books, older and leather bound‚Äù"
18-07-2019T17:58:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"side note, she‚Äôs immediately who I thought of when I saw that quote"
18-07-2019T17:59:10,TeapotOfDoom,Just a question out of curiosity: is it true that you're not obligadet to learn a second language in american schools?
18-07-2019T17:59:28,TeapotOfDoom,Depends how you define bound i guess
18-07-2019T17:59:39,SpazztasticKiwi,not really
18-07-2019T17:59:58,SpazztasticKiwi,I took Spanish as part of the honors diploma
18-07-2019T18:00:21,TeapotOfDoom,Any now you tried german?
18-07-2019T18:00:32,SpazztasticKiwi,taking that on my own time
18-07-2019T18:00:39,Bgrmystr2,"@Teapot can confirm, true. You DO take a language course in school, but it's not necessary to pass it to continue to the next grade."
18-07-2019T18:00:53,IronHorseComics,it depends on state
18-07-2019T18:01:00,TeapotOfDoom,Really now?
18-07-2019T18:01:02,Bgrmystr2,Yeah probably depends on state
18-07-2019T18:01:27,TeapotOfDoom,"If you fail anything where i am, you dont continue"
18-07-2019T18:01:30,Bgrmystr2,I lived in Georgia in elementary and middle school so there's that
18-07-2019T18:01:30,IronHorseComics,I have to take a couple language classes (took Spanish as it was my only option...at the time I wanted to learn French)
18-07-2019T18:01:38,TeapotOfDoom,Especially language
18-07-2019T18:02:01,Bgrmystr2,the only thing I know of that absolutely holds you back is failing English 1 2 3 or 4 in high school
18-07-2019T18:02:12,Bgrmystr2,since that's the primary language everyone uses
18-07-2019T18:02:18,SpazztasticKiwi,you had four feckin English
18-07-2019T18:02:22,Bgrmystr2,yes
18-07-2019T18:02:30,SpazztasticKiwi,we had 2 1/2
18-07-2019T18:02:30,Bgrmystr2,"in Louisiana, you have to pass all four."
18-07-2019T18:02:47,SpazztasticKiwi,‚Äúyears of experience don‚Äôt make me an expert?‚Äù
18-07-2019T18:02:48,IronHorseComics,it was mainly for writing grammar (fat load of good it does)
18-07-2019T18:02:50,Bgrmystr2,and they CANNOT be taken in a single year in high school
18-07-2019T18:03:00,Bgrmystr2,meaning you have to stay back a grade if you fail one.
18-07-2019T18:03:06,IronHorseComics,*if memory serves me correctly
18-07-2019T18:03:08,Bgrmystr2,"so 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th"
18-07-2019T18:03:21,TeapotOfDoom,"We have german classes for 12 years which encludes literature, writing stuff and so on"
18-07-2019T18:03:39,TeapotOfDoom,At least if you wanna go to uni
18-07-2019T18:04:36,TeapotOfDoom,Also as one could guess i had to learn english. For 10 years i think
18-07-2019T18:05:14,SpazztasticKiwi,"for my honors I had 2 year English , 2 year foreign language, math class level to precal, 2/3 years history"
18-07-2019T18:05:19,TeapotOfDoom,And last but not least tambien hablo espa√±ol. Pero solo un poco. 3 years
18-07-2019T18:05:23,TeapotOfDoom,So yeah
18-07-2019T18:05:38,SpazztasticKiwi,plus a few elecives
18-07-2019T18:06:13,IronHorseComics,I had PE and drama as electives
18-07-2019T18:06:24,SpazztasticKiwi,last thing that guy said when they left by the way?
18-07-2019T18:06:34,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúI wish I was fucking Mexican‚Äù
18-07-2019T18:06:34,IronHorseComics,oh no
18-07-2019T18:06:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Lord take us now
18-07-2019T18:06:42,IronHorseComics,"""*facepalm*"
18-07-2019T18:06:58,IronHorseComics,"right, let me grab the baseball bat, I'll be right over"
18-07-2019T18:07:20,IronHorseComics,"now, which one though? the two wood ones or the metal one?"
18-07-2019T18:07:37,TeapotOfDoom,Your school system seems to be quite different to ours... we normally have kinda less choice. You select your branch and most things are done
18-07-2019T18:07:53,TeapotOfDoom,Which one hits harder?
18-07-2019T18:08:11,SpazztasticKiwi,depends how hard you swing
18-07-2019T18:08:12,TeapotOfDoom,I think wood would be the better choice. Has more mass
18-07-2019T18:08:14,IronHorseComics,the metal but I only have one
18-07-2019T18:08:38,IronHorseComics,and I won't be able to share the enjoyment otherwise
18-07-2019T18:10:26,TeapotOfDoom,Also why would you wish to be mexican?
18-07-2019T18:10:39,IronHorseComics,so that you can cry racism at everything?
18-07-2019T18:10:50,SpazztasticKiwi,the little toddler size girl was better behaved then those teenagers
18-07-2019T18:10:51,TeapotOfDoom,Do they?
18-07-2019T18:10:59,IronHorseComics,not really
18-07-2019T18:11:07,IronHorseComics,not the ones I knew at least
18-07-2019T18:11:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I believe what he said was it‚Äôs because they are
18-07-2019T18:11:19,SpazztasticKiwi,uh
18-07-2019T18:11:21,TeapotOfDoom,Nothing new spazz...
18-07-2019T18:11:26,SpazztasticKiwi,bigger downstairs
18-07-2019T18:11:32,TeapotOfDoom,Oh
18-07-2019T18:11:39,TeapotOfDoom,:ctwokinds-keifacepalm:
18-07-2019T18:11:44,SpazztasticKiwi,I was trying to zone out by that point
18-07-2019T18:12:02,IronHorseComics,he should have asked to be someone else if that's the case
18-07-2019T18:12:16,IronHorseComics,or better yet not speak at all
18-07-2019T18:12:33,TeapotOfDoom,"If that's the only reason, send help..."
18-07-2019T18:12:35,SpazztasticKiwi,light travels faster than sound
18-07-2019T18:12:49,SpazztasticKiwi,He certainly seemed brighter than he really was before he spoke
18-07-2019T18:13:09,TeapotOfDoom,Ruins it most of the time
18-07-2019T18:15:28,TeapotOfDoom,There are two things that are infinite: The universe and human stupidity. With the universe I'm not sure
18-07-2019T18:16:03,Bgrmystr2,lel that's a good quote
18-07-2019T18:16:13,Bgrmystr2,Dunno who originally said it
18-07-2019T18:16:16,TeapotOfDoom,Einstein as far as i know
18-07-2019T18:16:42,Bgrmystr2,a lot of people quote people like Einstein with quotes that they never actually said
18-07-2019T18:16:48,IronHorseComics,"well, if all else fails, I suggest using Jabba the Stabbah"
18-07-2019T18:16:51,Bgrmystr2,xD
18-07-2019T18:16:52,TeapotOfDoom,Yeah i know
18-07-2019T18:17:00,TeapotOfDoom,Lol
18-07-2019T18:17:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Today said it when he was drunk
18-07-2019T18:17:06,SpazztasticKiwi,yoda
18-07-2019T18:17:21,IronHorseComics,"and use it's finishing move ""Stabbah the Butt"""
18-07-2019T18:17:29,TeapotOfDoom,Einstein zweistein dreistein vierstein
18-07-2019T18:18:43,TeapotOfDoom,That sounds dangerous
18-07-2019T18:18:45,SpazztasticKiwi,it sounds like someone‚Äôs car alarm is going off in the drive thru
18-07-2019T18:19:17,TeapotOfDoom,"The ""mexican"" needed a car"
18-07-2019T18:20:12,SpazztasticKiwi,oh he had one. Or at least one of the lemurs did
18-07-2019T18:20:25,SpazztasticKiwi,a jacked up further than necessary truck of course
18-07-2019T18:20:25,TeapotOfDoom,Lemurs ^^
18-07-2019T18:21:40,IronHorseComics,"and now, one of the oldest jokes in the book *ahem*"
18-07-2019T18:21:47,TeapotOfDoom,Everytime you hit the gas pedal the exhaust expells a humble fuck you to the environment
18-07-2019T18:21:57,IronHorseComics,"""If yer wheels are bigger than yer truck, you might be a redneck"""
18-07-2019T18:22:30,SpazztasticKiwi,The quote I like best about big trucks is ‚Äúsorry bout your dick bro‚Äù
18-07-2019T18:22:50,TeapotOfDoom,Now that's quite the criterion
18-07-2019T18:23:08,TeapotOfDoom,Lol boom roasted
18-07-2019T18:23:27,SpazztasticKiwi,based on the study done on howler monkeys that found those who were the most vocal in their calls were the younger and...smallest
18-07-2019T18:24:14,TeapotOfDoom,You don't need advertisement if the product speaks for itself so to speak
18-07-2019T18:24:42,IronHorseComics,"you didn't need to look at monkeys, just look at dogs, all the little ones don't know when to shut up and the big dogs are like ""yeah, whatever"""
18-07-2019T18:25:22,SpazztasticKiwi,that‚Äôs also thought to be partially due to people believing smaller dogs don‚Äôt need discipline
18-07-2019T18:25:27,TeapotOfDoom,My dog silenced one or two miniature car alarms when they became to annoying
18-07-2019T18:25:29,SpazztasticKiwi,because they‚Äôre small
18-07-2019T18:26:07,TeapotOfDoom,Also that i can support
18-07-2019T18:27:04,TeapotOfDoom,If he decides to get vocal it gets loud
18-07-2019T18:27:13,SpazztasticKiwi,speaking of which my cousin who got bit by two ankle biters the other day has told the owners will have to pay a nice lil fine to get their dogs back from animal control
18-07-2019T18:27:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"and that‚Äôs not including the citation fines, court fines, or court costs"
18-07-2019T18:27:47,TeapotOfDoom,Lol well so much for lil dogs can cause much harm
18-07-2019T18:29:21,Bgrmystr2,the idea that small dogs can't cause harm is dumb
18-07-2019T18:29:49,Bgrmystr2,just because they don't have the strength of a bigger dog does not mean it can't hurt you
18-07-2019T18:30:07,TeapotOfDoom,Chihuahuas are the most aggressive breed as far as i know
18-07-2019T18:30:15,SpazztasticKiwi,I bet Tom‚Äôs sleeping like the dead away from his mothers dogs
18-07-2019T18:30:27,TeapotOfDoom,Why?
18-07-2019T18:30:39,TeapotOfDoom,Chaos impersinated?
18-07-2019T18:30:47,IronHorseComics,no they're both so sweet
18-07-2019T18:30:53,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôll quote Mark: ‚Äúlittle yippy bastards‚Äù
18-07-2019T18:31:26,TeapotOfDoom,Sounds kinda like chaos to me
18-07-2019T18:31:33,TeapotOfDoom,The good kind
18-07-2019T18:31:46,TeapotOfDoom,But still kinda chaotic
18-07-2019T18:31:54,IronHorseComics,isn't one of them a big dog?
18-07-2019T18:32:07,SpazztasticKiwi,well Tom doesn‚Äôt seem to have much fun with it
18-07-2019T18:32:10,IronHorseComics,like a great big white ball of fluff
18-07-2019T18:32:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Lucy‚Äôs the only big dog
18-07-2019T18:32:26,SpazztasticKiwi,far as I know
18-07-2019T18:32:32,SpazztasticKiwi,but she still barks
18-07-2019T18:32:44,TeapotOfDoom,Why that? To much work?
18-07-2019T18:32:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Toms said he‚Äôs got to be careful sometimes at night cause the floors creakican set them off
18-07-2019T18:33:11,TeapotOfDoom,Oh
18-07-2019T18:33:16,TeapotOfDoom,Nooo
18-07-2019T18:33:41,TeapotOfDoom,That's annoying. My aunts dog's like that
18-07-2019T18:33:53,TeapotOfDoom,I know that to well
18-07-2019T18:34:18,SpazztasticKiwi,God bless him he‚Äôs got to have the patience of Job
18-07-2019T18:35:46,CrRAR,"job, like the biblical dude?"
18-07-2019T18:35:57,SpazztasticKiwi,or he‚Äôs constantly simmering on the edge of insanity
18-07-2019T18:36:37,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-keith8D:
18-07-2019T18:36:42,TeapotOfDoom,Can understand that... she's worse than an alarm clock. Cause you can stop an alarm clock
18-07-2019T18:36:50,CrRAR,"With emores like this, who needs sanity?"
18-07-2019T18:37:02,TeapotOfDoom,Noone

18-07-2019T18:37:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I have a friend that lives with a few small children and the family has a few dogs that are rather vocal
18-07-2019T18:37:54,SpazztasticKiwi,There‚Äôs been a few times she‚Äôs been over just to get some damn sleep
18-07-2019T18:38:09,IronHorseComics,"I remember coming home from the night shift at Amazon, the little Pomeranian we had barked in the morning initially but rather quickly became used to me coming in at 6:30 AM"
18-07-2019T18:38:44,IronHorseComics,but he would always come to the top stair and wait for me as I made my way up
18-07-2019T18:38:54,CrRAR,"lil dog, big attitude"
18-07-2019T18:39:01,TeapotOfDoom,"Speaking of sleeping, I'm tired out of my mind"
18-07-2019T18:39:11,IronHorseComics,go to bed Teapot
18-07-2019T18:39:37,TeapotOfDoom,That's exactly what I'm gonna do now

18-07-2019T18:41:26,SpazztasticKiwi,my moms got a chihuahua pomeranian mess
18-07-2019T18:41:34,SpazztasticKiwi,he has a seal bark
18-07-2019T18:41:57,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs like he can‚Äôt get past doggie baritone
18-07-2019T18:43:44,SpazztasticKiwi,other than that our dogs don‚Äôt have much oomph to their yip
18-07-2019T18:44:20,IronHorseComics,"ah, speaking of barking, our current dog is barking her brain out, parents are home"
18-07-2019T18:45:08,SpazztasticKiwi,lord I‚Äôm not a dog person
18-07-2019T18:45:49,SpazztasticKiwi,makes me think of Mark threatening to bite someone

18-07-2019T18:46:52,SpazztasticKiwi,and mark just ‚Äúif you mean you come up and pet Chica that‚Äôs fine she loves pets but if you try to pet me on the head I‚Äôll bite you‚Äù

18-07-2019T20:15:46,Sclimshady,:csagesaga-PhilHuh:

18-07-2019T20:16:00,Ordithus,That emote will get use
18-07-2019T20:16:01,CrRAR,yes yes? YES!?
18-07-2019T20:16:20,Sclimshady,"I still want my ""concerned"" emote"
18-07-2019T20:16:28,SageSaga,The Katbox is shutting down as a hosting site- it will no longer host webcomics
18-07-2019T20:16:40,IronHorseComics,aw that sucks
18-07-2019T20:16:43,Sclimshady,:ctwokinds-zenshocked:
18-07-2019T20:16:50,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:cmarvthehugpharaoh-Farquid:
18-07-2019T20:16:50,Ordithus,"Oh, wow."
18-07-2019T20:16:56,IronHorseComics,what are you going to do then?
18-07-2019T20:17:04,SageSaga,it'll be up for a while but we'll be moving to different hosting services
18-07-2019T20:17:20,Nekonny,The Katbox is moving from hoting comics to just linking to comics
18-07-2019T20:17:27,SageSaga,Yosh and AI will be up on their own sites
18-07-2019T20:17:31,Nekonny,*hosting
18-07-2019T20:17:44,SageSaga,so the Katbox will basically just be a webcomic community thing
18-07-2019T20:17:45,Nekonny,"so will Cblue, PmP"
18-07-2019T20:17:45,Mihari,"The site itself will stop hosting the sites as they are, a smaller site will be used to still link all the pages to their new homes, in some case the shutdown may not even be apparent at all."
18-07-2019T20:17:49,Nekonny,paprika and imew
18-07-2019T20:18:03,IronHorseComics,I would suggest KeenSpot but you have to go through their free thing and by golly is signing up for the free version out of date
18-07-2019T20:18:15,SageSaga,no thanks
18-07-2019T20:18:21,Nekonny,"In my case I'll be moving to a new site, Kemono.cafe"
18-07-2019T20:18:29,CrRAR,cool
18-07-2019T20:18:30,Nekonny,https://kemono.cafe/
18-07-2019T20:18:37,Sclimshady,No surprise there Ron
18-07-2019T20:18:47,IronHorseComics,Comic Fury has been good to me so far
18-07-2019T20:18:53,SageSaga,artificial incident will be moving to - well - artificialincident.com
18-07-2019T20:19:00,Ordithus,Good luck with the transition!
18-07-2019T20:19:04,SageSaga,and yosh will be at yoshsaga.com
18-07-2019T20:19:09,SageSaga,and yoshcomics.com
18-07-2019T20:19:14,SageSaga,and yoshcomic.com
18-07-2019T20:19:24,Ordithus,All the urls
18-07-2019T20:19:25,IronHorseComics,just gotta re-learn HTML5 to really make the style pop
18-07-2019T20:19:33,SageSaga,nope
18-07-2019T20:19:37,Mihari,"Maybe should you just hand out that other domain and make it so it links to both to split off, but people can still go to all those? XD"
18-07-2019T20:19:45,Nekonny,?
18-07-2019T20:19:52,SageSaga,nah that link isnt ready yet
18-07-2019T20:20:00,SageSaga,i'll have a site that links to all my work though
18-07-2019T20:20:01,Mihari,"Ah, true!"
18-07-2019T20:20:32,SageSaga,i'll let yall know when thats up- unless Mihari lets you know when its up- because She still my amazing Webmistress
18-07-2019T20:21:01,SageSaga,so everyone is still figuring things out- but everyone will have a home
18-07-2019T20:21:17,NezumiYuki,Pretty neat Sage!
18-07-2019T20:21:18,SageSaga,so its not a huge deal for readers but some of the artist are taking it hard
18-07-2019T20:21:29,NezumiYuki,hmmmm
18-07-2019T20:21:47,SageSaga,we artist are sensitive creatures that dont like change :PO
18-07-2019T20:21:53,Nekonny,The Kb will stay active as a hosign for a while still
18-07-2019T20:22:01,Nekonny,so nothing changes for the immediate
18-07-2019T20:22:08,SageSaga,and the Katbox discord will still be a thing
18-07-2019T20:22:10,Nekonny,*hosting
18-07-2019T20:22:34,Ordithus,"Seems it will be easy on the readers, at least"
18-07-2019T20:22:42,Nekonny,thats the idea!
18-07-2019T20:22:44,SageSaga,i was going to save this for next week to let people know- but some people have already mentioned it
18-07-2019T20:23:02,IronHorseComics,"gee, thanks Spoilers"
18-07-2019T20:23:05,SageSaga,so I rather y'all hear it from us instead of rumor mill
18-07-2019T20:23:07,Tharkis,"my kemono cafe hat was on the front page of the lewiston/auburn maine newspaper last weekend, unfortunately you couldnt read it"
18-07-2019T20:23:41,IronHorseComics,"you know that would actually make a great group of lame supervillains ""The Spoilers"""
18-07-2019T20:23:56,CrRAR,haha
18-07-2019T20:23:57,Ordithus,"Oh, by the way, Ron the site looks nice!"
18-07-2019T20:24:06,IronHorseComics,where they go around spoiling movies for people
18-07-2019T20:24:42,Nekonny,thanks man!
18-07-2019T20:24:48,Nekonny,i worked really hard on it XD
18-07-2019T20:24:56,SageSaga,Spoiler is a vigilanti super hero
18-07-2019T20:25:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Like Bruce man
18-07-2019T20:25:44,Mihari,"You need to make more tweets tho Ron, that twitter sidebar.... XD"
18-07-2019T20:26:05,Ordithus,What will Mihari do with all her free time?
18-07-2019T20:26:11,Nekonny,I know... I'll try to get that going
18-07-2019T20:26:13,IronHorseComics,"speaking of twitter, they hit us with that new UI thing"
18-07-2019T20:26:22,Mihari,I don't have free time.
18-07-2019T20:26:33,Mihari,I just shift stuff around so I can get things done.
18-07-2019T20:26:44,IronHorseComics,I hate that they took away our custom colors and gave us garbage ones
18-07-2019T20:27:12,Mihari,"Twitter is being lazy, they are replacing all their locations with one look and design so they only have to update one thing."
18-07-2019T20:27:33,Nekonny,the colors on this one are... confusing me
18-07-2019T20:27:34,IronHorseComics,"I prefer my greens being grass green, not the girly avacado green"
18-07-2019T20:27:50,NezumiYuki,avacado?  LOL
18-07-2019T20:27:51,Nekonny,"its a bit of a rainbow, but everyting in a simmilar hue"
18-07-2019T20:28:08,Nekonny,I wish davo was here
18-07-2019T20:28:11,Mihari,Take a sample and just paint it in!
18-07-2019T20:28:22,Nekonny,I duppose so
18-07-2019T20:28:32,IronHorseComics,"they also brought in the insane stupid ""top tweets"" from the mobile version to the PC one"
18-07-2019T20:28:46,Nekonny,brb
18-07-2019T20:28:53,Mihari,Or just paste this emote all over it: :ptv-RainbowThrowup:
18-07-2019T20:28:58,Ordithus,haha
18-07-2019T20:29:13,Sclimshady,"How do you change it back, i like my latest tweets"
18-07-2019T20:29:20,Mihari,You can't.
18-07-2019T20:29:48,Sclimshady,"I figured, now im sad.  im gonna miss out on so much art"
18-07-2019T20:30:03,SageSaga,I might have to send you this file Mihari to make these into gifs- though i wish Picarto would just let us use PNGs
18-07-2019T20:30:13,IronHorseComics,yes you can... it's that bunch of stars at the top
18-07-2019T20:30:21,Mihari,"Umm, okay?"
18-07-2019T20:30:34,Sclimshady,"Thats only on mobile though, right?"
18-07-2019T20:30:37,Mihari,"I'm gonna go install that card real quick tho, might take me a bit longer cause gonna clean out the case."
18-07-2019T20:30:45,IronHorseComics,no it's PC too
18-07-2019T20:30:49,SageSaga,np good luck hun!

18-07-2019T20:31:02,Mihari,I'll load the stream on my tablet tho
18-07-2019T20:31:02,IronHorseComics,"they just brought that over like, yesterday"
18-07-2019T20:31:30,Sclimshady,"Ah, i didnt see that last time"
18-07-2019T20:31:34,w0lfmare,Yeah I just use Twitter's legacy mode

18-07-2019T20:33:18,IronHorseComics,me too
18-07-2019T20:33:26,IronHorseComics,oh that's just not fair
18-07-2019T20:34:06,w0lfmare,Top right profile icon> bottom button? That's where I can toggle to the new Twitter
18-07-2019T20:34:07,SageSaga,but they removed it with the update- which I got on Day One
18-07-2019T20:34:19,Ordithus,Sage you're going to make me sad that my copy of FFT is broken
18-07-2019T20:34:37,SageSaga,you should be sad about that
18-07-2019T20:34:42,SageSaga,that's a tragedy
18-07-2019T20:34:50,Ordithus,I am :ptv-whiny:
18-07-2019T20:35:01,SageSaga,if you werent already sad then theres something wrong with you!

18-07-2019T20:40:46,Flake,heya
18-07-2019T20:40:46,Vatruvius,Thought I would check in since I got the stream notification. Just wanted to let you know Sage that you have been doing a really great job and currently I am waiting for every page release for both comics.
18-07-2019T20:41:09,SageSaga,thanks a lot Vatruvius!
18-07-2019T20:42:56,NezumiYuki,@Nekonny  The dragun gurl is looking cute!
18-07-2019T20:43:06,IronHorseComics,"privacy, maybe?"
18-07-2019T20:43:52,NezumiYuki,Mmmm Nets!
18-07-2019T20:43:54,SageSaga,you can setup OBS to not show anything other than the window you want
18-07-2019T20:43:56,NezumiYuki,I soooo approve of nets!
18-07-2019T20:43:59,NezumiYuki,And slings!
18-07-2019T20:44:12,NezumiYuki,Slings plus nets = <3
18-07-2019T20:44:16,SageSaga,y'all cant see everything i have open- only what i want you to see
18-07-2019T20:44:21,IronHorseComics,"I know, I was just making a guess"
18-07-2019T20:44:39,Sclimshady,Sage is our viewing God
18-07-2019T20:45:51,SageSaga,i dont really like anyone being called a god
18-07-2019T20:46:12,SageSaga,it undermines all the hard work we put into things
18-07-2019T20:46:32,NezumiYuki,Gozer the Gozarian:  Are you a god?
18-07-2019T20:46:36,Sclimshady,I was saying you control what we see
18-07-2019T20:46:38,SemuElo,:ptv-excited:
18-07-2019T20:46:49,Nekonny,Heya Semu!
18-07-2019T20:46:51,ZRO4825,More like a ringmaster than a god.

18-07-2019T20:51:13,Sclimshady,?
18-07-2019T20:51:29,BadFoMo,"Also, why the **** was the alarm for 9:30 PM EST on my fully charged phone turned off?! #CapLock"
18-07-2019T20:51:35,Ordithus,Sage.  The opening is working :ptv-excited:
18-07-2019T20:51:40,SageSaga,"""Hmm my music seems a little quiet- huh- its at max? Well i'll turn it down a little *Gets really loud* but- BUT I TURNED IT DOWN!"""

18-07-2019T20:52:44,SageSaga,congrats- my FFT disc and PS1 were taken from me
18-07-2019T20:53:19,Ordithus,:csagesaga-PhilHuh:
18-07-2019T20:53:31,SageSaga,i gotta delete that till i get it fixed
18-07-2019T20:54:00,Nekonny,what?
18-07-2019T20:54:08,SageSaga,the emote
18-07-2019T20:54:16,NezumiYuki,is confused... she does not understand the context of what was just said about playstation ones...
18-07-2019T20:54:33,Nekonny,whats wrng with it?
18-07-2019T20:54:36,SageSaga,my brother took my PS1 and my games and sold them
18-07-2019T20:54:39,Nekonny,you wanted transparent background?
18-07-2019T20:54:44,Sclimshady,:csagesaga-PhilHuh:
18-07-2019T20:54:50,NezumiYuki,oh shi  Sage!
18-07-2019T20:54:53,SageSaga,yes Ron- the background is transparent but it didnt save
18-07-2019T20:54:58,NezumiYuki,sorry to hear that  =(
18-07-2019T20:55:01,Nekonny,wondt the ?? vanish?
18-07-2019T20:55:09,Nekonny,*woudnt
18-07-2019T20:55:11,SageSaga,naturally i would change them to white
18-07-2019T20:55:25,Ordithus,Nice biker Kaylin
18-07-2019T20:59:51,NezumiYuki,"Ah neat, so she will have various suit types?"
18-07-2019T21:00:38,IronHorseComics,I honestly like this suit more than the stringking Nekonny
18-07-2019T21:00:56,IronHorseComics,leaves a more to the imagination
18-07-2019T21:01:07,NezumiYuki,"I like this one too, but slings do it for me.  xD"
18-07-2019T21:02:19,Ordithus,"Slings are nice and all, but the more ""full"" suit is cuter"
18-07-2019T21:02:29,Nekonny,Just these two
18-07-2019T21:03:58,NezumiYuki,"back again, and okay yes I can agree with you Ord, that the one piece is cute! <3"
18-07-2019T21:04:39,NezumiYuki,@Sagesaga   Looking kinda like Vash the stampeed there!   Neat!
18-07-2019T21:05:12,SageSaga,wat
18-07-2019T21:05:30,NezumiYuki,the buttons on top sorta look like Vash in a way
18-07-2019T21:06:27,NezumiYuki,"Oh geez that color blending, Nekos...."
18-07-2019T21:06:37,SageSaga,i dont see how anything that has a boob window would be compared to Vash the Stampede...
18-07-2019T21:06:51,NezumiYuki,Just the buttons on top  xD
18-07-2019T21:07:04,OneTrick,"Darn, this dragon is gorgeous"
18-07-2019T21:07:11,Nekonny,thanks one ^^
18-07-2019T21:11:00,Nekonny,"Yeah, the color was a challange"
18-07-2019T21:11:07,Nekonny,I was panicking a bit
18-07-2019T21:11:14,Nekonny,then mihari pushed me off the cliff
18-07-2019T21:12:53,IronHorseComics,I'm sure it was just a gentle nudge
18-07-2019T21:15:12,NezumiYuki,"Ya know what we need, Nekos?   Nood version! >:3"
18-07-2019T21:15:21,Tharkis,"dont blame mihari, it's feline nature to push objects off of ledges !"
18-07-2019T21:15:27,Tharkis,:ctharkis-earwiggle:

18-07-2019T22:10:55,NezumiYuki,gimme a sec

18-07-2019T22:11:10,ZRO4825,I just keep popping in during deliveries is all. Hell only knows what time I'll actually be off work. :(
18-07-2019T22:11:15,SageSaga,almost all of Jojos ending themes are Classic Rock songs
18-07-2019T22:11:22,NezumiYuki,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPCLFtxpadE
18-07-2019T22:11:32,SageSaga,and most of it's characters are classic rock bands
18-07-2019T22:11:39,IronHorseComics,wait they used more than one?
18-07-2019T22:11:47,IronHorseComics,*never watched JoJo*
18-07-2019T22:12:16,SageSaga,"Led Zeplin, Dio, they even have Vanilla Ice and Spice Girl"
18-07-2019T22:12:27,SageSaga,Green Day
18-07-2019T22:12:54,Dadrobit,AC/DC
18-07-2019T22:13:09,SageSaga,Tom Petty
18-07-2019T22:13:17,NezumiYuki,TOM PETTY OMG
18-07-2019T22:13:17,SageSaga,REO SPEEDWAGON
18-07-2019T22:13:25,IronHorseComics,*that moment when you learn an anime has more classic rock jokes than any western show*
18-07-2019T22:13:38,SageSaga,Dire and Straizo were based on Dire Straits
18-07-2019T22:14:31,Dadrobit,*Bassline Groove Intensifies*
18-07-2019T22:14:35,ZRO4825,"Did ya need anything, Sage? :o"
18-07-2019T22:14:41,NezumiYuki,I want my MTVvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv!
18-07-2019T22:14:45,SageSaga,nope
18-07-2019T22:14:54,IronHorseComics,any Queen jokes?
18-07-2019T22:15:17,SageSaga,yes
18-07-2019T22:15:50,SageSaga,there was a chapter called Ogre Battle
18-07-2019T22:15:55,SageSaga,which is a Queen song
18-07-2019T22:16:46,IronHorseComics,surprised they didn't go with the more obvious ones
18-07-2019T22:17:21,IronHorseComics,"can you imagine ""Bicycle Race"" playing during a chase scene? that would be hilarious"
18-07-2019T22:18:02,NezumiYuki,I want to ride my bicycle!   Bicycle  Bicycle!!!!
18-07-2019T22:18:55,SageSaga,im pretty sure they have a character or stand based on Bohemian Rhapsody
18-07-2019T22:19:14,IronHorseComics,I'll take that
18-07-2019T22:19:42,SageSaga,yep- found it
18-07-2019T22:19:51,Dadrobit,"Also, Western shows can't really make those kinds of jokes. If something started making big bad guys named after bad guys over here, there'd be a much higher threat of lawsuits regarding brand devaluation."
18-07-2019T22:19:58,SageSaga,next anime series has a stand named Bohemian Rhapsody
18-07-2019T22:20:02,Dadrobit,named after bands*
18-07-2019T22:20:04,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Daddy!! <3
18-07-2019T22:20:11,Dadrobit,Marv!!!

18-07-2019T22:20:46,SageSaga,lol in Dio's diary there is a mention of 4 Rhino Beatles
18-07-2019T22:20:56,SageSaga,The Beatles
18-07-2019T22:20:57,RimaDraws,looks nice
18-07-2019T22:20:58,IronHorseComics,"yeah, they'd to the brand devaluation themselves by filing BS copyright claims"
18-07-2019T22:21:01,Dadrobit,I'm actually super late for work. I'll be back in an hour or so.
18-07-2019T22:21:14,FoxxTrotter,"C-ya, Dadrobit."
18-07-2019T22:21:18,Dadrobit,It's not BS copyright at all tbh.

18-07-2019T22:22:46,Mihari,You finally put me in the cafe outfit?

18-07-2019T22:24:36,Nekonny,but I thought you were still watching tho
18-07-2019T22:24:58,Mihari,"I was kinda, but I can only watch one active stream at a time with the phone."
18-07-2019T22:25:23,NezumiYuki,"ya know what Ron, be kind to the speed neko.  Put her Mihari in the cafe outfit for the next slot!  :D"
18-07-2019T22:26:04,Mihari,"Nah, don't, if he's going to do one for me I want him to take his time and do it right. :P"
18-07-2019T22:26:20,Mihari,"The process he uses for stream stuff is a lot faster sure, but it's just not the same."
18-07-2019T22:26:21,NezumiYuki,Ah okay makes perfect sense.  ^^
18-07-2019T22:26:35,Nekonny,>.>
18-07-2019T22:26:41,NezumiYuki,"Still Ron, consider it some time!  :D"
18-07-2019T22:26:44,Nekonny,I still do ok art in stream
18-07-2019T22:26:50,Mihari,I didn't say you didn't.
18-07-2019T22:26:52,Nekonny,"I thought ^_^"""
18-07-2019T22:27:00,Mihari,But I don't want 'OK'

18-07-2019T22:27:07,RimaDraws,what are you talking about your art is amazing
18-07-2019T22:27:20,NezumiYuki,Mihari... you perfectionist you!  xDD
18-07-2019T22:27:34,Mihari,"I tell that to him all the time, but he fell into this spot where he refined this quick style so he could manage all those projects he's doing XD"
18-07-2019T22:27:42,NezumiYuki,oh sorry that should have sounded more like.... Purrrrrrfection
18-07-2019T22:27:44,Mihari,"It's not pefection, I Just know full well he's capable of."
18-07-2019T22:27:55,NezumiYuki,Ah okay point taken  ^^
18-07-2019T22:27:57,Mihari,And I want him to excercise that style
18-07-2019T22:28:03,NezumiYuki,Ahhh!
18-07-2019T22:28:18,Mihari,Cause eveyone else here is clearly happy with what he does as is :P

18-07-2019T22:30:48,Mihari,But pull it up
18-07-2019T22:30:50,Mihari,and compare it
18-07-2019T22:30:56,Mihari,It's pre-quickie style

18-07-2019T22:32:56,Nekonny,2011
18-07-2019T22:33:16,Mihari,In my opinion that's leaps and bounds better than most of what you do now.
18-07-2019T22:33:19,Tharkis,"mmm, :sushi:"
18-07-2019T22:33:28,Nekonny,"gee, thanks"

18-07-2019T22:34:58,Mihari,You went down another path to refine speed but still trying to push it for quality.
18-07-2019T22:35:24,Mihari,That's not to say these aren't good.

18-07-2019T22:46:55,SageSaga,my medicine is for gastroesophageal reflux disease

18-07-2019T22:47:35,SageSaga,yo Royyalist
18-07-2019T22:47:44,RimaDraws,i will guess it has to do with certain foods you cant have that makes your stomach hurt
18-07-2019T22:47:44,NezumiYuki,Hi hi Royal
18-07-2019T22:48:06,SpazztasticKiwi,the devils heartburn I guess

18-07-2019T22:49:03,SpazztasticKiwi,guess God knocked over everything on the counter while mixing your putty for the mold
18-07-2019T22:49:05,SageSaga,drinking water- should not cause heartburn XD
18-07-2019T22:49:06,Sclimshady,It's overactive acid production that wears at the duodenum
18-07-2019T22:49:16,SpazztasticKiwi,‚Äúah well I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll be fine‚Äù
18-07-2019T22:49:46,SageSaga,"my doctor was like ""ok you see this dosage on the liquid stuff? Ignore it- take as much as you need to feel better"""

18-07-2019T22:51:02,IronHorseComics,every time I go to Steak & Shake my tongue gets scorched when I don't use ketchup
18-07-2019T22:51:03,SageSaga,pretty mild cases when it happens
18-07-2019T22:51:23,SageSaga,and im even down to a half dose of the liquid stuff instead of double

18-07-2019T23:01:10,ZRO4825,But I have Kaylin o.o
18-07-2019T23:01:21,SageSaga,you have her shadow clone
18-07-2019T23:01:25,SageSaga,I kept the real one
18-07-2019T23:01:45,NezumiYuki,"so shadow clones are good, or no?"
18-07-2019T23:01:56,SageSaga,so you better be careful Zro- if you damage her she'll poof
18-07-2019T23:01:58,SpazztasticKiwi,theoretically there‚Äôs a clone of everyone
18-07-2019T23:02:14,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs said there‚Äôs at least 7 people on earth that look like you
18-07-2019T23:02:17,ZRO4825,Well as long as you don't hit them hard enough to dispel them...
18-07-2019T23:02:24,Sclimshady,I feel so bad for them
18-07-2019T23:02:33,ZRO4825,So far the clone is good o.o;;;
18-07-2019T23:02:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I knew someone would say that
18-07-2019T23:03:35,NezumiYuki,"Sadly I must be going, but this was fun hanging out with you guys, Nekos, Sage.    Wish you well, and catch ya again some time soon!  :)"
18-07-2019T23:03:52,Sclimshady,Bye Nezumi! o/

18-07-2019T23:04:09,NezumiYuki,Nighty ^^
18-07-2019T23:04:10,SageSaga,take care Nezumi ty for joining us!
18-07-2019T23:04:31,SpazztasticKiwi,here‚Äôs a weird question but I‚Äôve been told that I do - what would y‚Äôall do if you were told you were a gay magnet
18-07-2019T23:04:47,FoxxTrotter,"G'night, Nezumi."
18-07-2019T23:05:04,SageSaga,am I gay in this theoretical situation Kiwi?
18-07-2019T23:05:11,SpazztasticKiwi,no
18-07-2019T23:05:25,Sclimshady,What if I want to be
18-07-2019T23:05:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm not the gay police
18-07-2019T23:05:41,SpazztasticKiwi,knock yourself out
18-07-2019T23:05:47,Ordithus,I would at first be confused.  Then flattered.  Then I'd watch my back
18-07-2019T23:06:31,SpazztasticKiwi,thing is I found it weird to be called a gay magnet
18-07-2019T23:06:38,Sclimshady,What if i have a lot of gay friends but they say they don't find me attractive
18-07-2019T23:06:42,SpazztasticKiwi,I think that‚Äôs called being likable Karen
18-07-2019T23:07:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I mean I find plenty of men not attractive is it that much different
18-07-2019T23:07:43,SpazztasticKiwi,tf you care if someone finds you physically appealing
18-07-2019T23:08:24,Sclimshady,"Just posing a question, it makes no difference to me"
18-07-2019T23:08:29,RimaDraws,tbh i never had anyone say i was attractive
18-07-2019T23:08:42,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve seen your Twitter
18-07-2019T23:08:49,Sclimshady,Oof
18-07-2019T23:08:53,SpazztasticKiwi,you‚Äôre lovely
18-07-2019T23:08:56,SageSaga,if you are seen as a gay magnet i would assume you have some trait people find desirable and it probably works on both men and women
18-07-2019T23:08:59,RimaDraws,do what
18-07-2019T23:09:18,SageSaga,since there are very few traits that are single sex appreciated
18-07-2019T23:09:33,SpazztasticKiwi,I have been told I attract weirdos at work so you may have a point Sage
18-07-2019T23:09:43,SpazztasticKiwi,all kinds
18-07-2019T23:10:05,RimaDraws,i think the only time when i was 18 and thinner that i had two college girls say i was cute
18-07-2019T23:10:26,SpazztasticKiwi,maybe being a gay magnet meant more that I had a number of such friends
18-07-2019T23:10:44,SageSaga,"i met a few guys at AC and i was like ""Holy crap these guys are really cute"""
18-07-2019T23:10:46,SpazztasticKiwi,ie - maybe they‚Äôre accusing me of being too nice
18-07-2019T23:11:11,RimaDraws,aw cute sage
18-07-2019T23:11:19,SpazztasticKiwi,you ever seen Fruits Basket?

18-07-2019T23:19:02,SpazztasticKiwi,if a breeze or particularly high step happens people will be getting a view
18-07-2019T23:19:29,Mihari,"Ron, I love you, but seriously, in the future consult with women for clothes :P"
18-07-2019T23:19:31,Nekonny,there!
