28-07-2019T00:37:47,SpazztasticKiwi,ze stream is done
28-07-2019T00:37:53,SpazztasticKiwi,twas good
28-07-2019T00:52:54,SpazztasticKiwi,still learning voices but good
28-07-2019T00:53:19,unsteddyphoenix,I cant believe Mark was a furry the whole time...
28-07-2019T00:55:36,SpazztasticKiwi,"that‚Äôs the thing Mark doesn‚Äôt seem to mind too much besides the fact that they sorta, well, furrified sexyified him"
28-07-2019T00:55:44,SpazztasticKiwi,and made him so cringy
28-07-2019T00:56:23,SpazztasticKiwi,basically once he finally unlocks the character he picks at ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not me‚Äù and ‚ÄúOk that‚Äôs me‚Äù
28-07-2019T00:56:49,unsteddyphoenix,"""wrong, wrong, right, right, VERY WRONG, right..."""
28-07-2019T00:56:53,SpazztasticKiwi,and there‚Äôs quite a few lines that really shouldn‚Äôt exist in anyone‚Äôs imagination
28-07-2019T00:56:59,unsteddyphoenix,Lmao
28-07-2019T00:57:03,unsteddyphoenix,Im getting curious...
28-07-2019T00:57:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I can semi quote mark: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ever say those words ever again‚Äù
28-07-2019T00:58:26,SpazztasticKiwi,"what‚Äôs worse is that the game is early access so only the first 6 characters are out & available. Full release will have 12 animal men, full voice lines, spelling fixes, tweaks and bug cleaning"
28-07-2019T00:58:40,SpazztasticKiwi,and a NSFW switch option
28-07-2019T00:59:09,unsteddyphoenix,oooh~
28-07-2019T00:59:29,unsteddyphoenix,Is it like...good?
28-07-2019T00:59:33,unsteddyphoenix,Like the writing?
28-07-2019T00:59:43,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs interesting as a joke more than anything
28-07-2019T00:59:58,unsteddyphoenix,ah I see
28-07-2019T01:00:15,SpazztasticKiwi,but seeing how far they kinda seem to go with Marks character I‚Äôm not sure fully how I am with it
28-07-2019T01:01:06,SpazztasticKiwi,they don‚Äôt blatantly say it‚Äôs him obviously or reference any inspiration (him) for the character and it also seems to be a sort of Septiplier mashup
28-07-2019T01:01:35,SpazztasticKiwi,"green and pink hair, blue eyes, Korean features to the face and Mark‚Äôs build"
28-07-2019T01:02:20,SpazztasticKiwi,other than the looks though it goes pretty full swing on Markiplier nudges
28-07-2019T01:06:18,unsteddyphoenix,lots of references?
28-07-2019T01:06:23,unsteddyphoenix,to  mark?
28-07-2019T01:09:05,BadFoMo,What are we talking about?
28-07-2019T01:20:45,SpazztasticKiwi,yeah many a reference to Mark - YouTube videos and quotes  - the character is named Ichiban - the name of a sushi place Mark worked at years and years ago
28-07-2019T01:22:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Marks video investigating the character they apparently made of him in blush blush game came up in lanns stream cause a separate character ‚Äúlooks like lann‚Äôs ‚Äòsona‚Äù
28-07-2019T01:22:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I will not be explaining this again
28-07-2019T01:23:21,SpazztasticKiwi,trust me you may want to watch his streams
28-07-2019T01:23:33,unsteddyphoenix,lol
28-07-2019T01:28:51,SpazztasticKiwi,something‚Äôs been eating my ankles up

28-07-2019T01:29:55,CrimsonQuill,How was the stream?
28-07-2019T01:46:55,DarthRexKing,Did Tom stream again or he still gone after that?
28-07-2019T01:47:18,CrimsonQuill,I wouldn't know
28-07-2019T01:47:37,CrimsonQuill,I just got up an hour and twenty minutes ago
28-07-2019T01:47:49,CrimsonQuill,I wasn't there for the stream anyhow.
28-07-2019T01:47:52,Bgrmystr2,tom stopped and said he would stream the rest tomorrow
28-07-2019T01:48:08,CrimsonQuill,"Oh hello, bgrmystr"
28-07-2019T01:48:19,CrimsonQuill,So the stream is split into two parts?>
28-07-2019T01:48:21,Bgrmystr2,Hello I've been here just lurking.
28-07-2019T01:48:29,CrimsonQuill,Ok
28-07-2019T01:48:44,CrimsonQuill,I watched Princess Mononoke again last night.
28-07-2019T01:48:46,Bgrmystr2,"That's not exactly how streams work, but I mean.. kinda sorta?"
28-07-2019T01:48:57,CrimsonQuill,Just a film I love
28-07-2019T01:49:12,CrimsonQuill,I probably will miss that half of the stream as well
28-07-2019T01:49:31,CrimsonQuill,Because I'm reading through some comics each night over the next two weeks
28-07-2019T01:49:57,DarthRexKing,"Okay. I fell asleep earlier, so I didn't know if he came back or not."
28-07-2019T01:49:58,CrimsonQuill,"And come to think of it, I'll miss the next week sketch stream...because I'll be at a place with no internet."
28-07-2019T01:50:05,DarthRexKing,I am going back to bed. Goodnight.
28-07-2019T01:50:16,CrimsonQuill,Night Rex
28-07-2019T01:50:20,CrimsonQuill,I need to have a shower

28-07-2019T15:32:40,SpazztasticKiwi,if it‚Äôs got a Nibbly it‚Äôs automatically adorable
28-07-2019T15:32:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Nibbly = adorable. It‚Äôs just math

28-07-2019T16:21:03,SpazztasticKiwi,and of course the zoo reports that one is very brave and wants to get into everything while the other prefers to watch his brothers shenanigans from a safe distance
28-07-2019T16:21:35,NezumiYuki,i find that bit of news highly dubious!

28-07-2019T16:23:05,NezumiYuki,Oh only a month?   They be weee litttle tykes
28-07-2019T16:23:27,SpazztasticKiwi,probably a big reason they don‚Äôt have names yet
28-07-2019T16:23:45,NezumiYuki,Give them a few months... They'll be giving the handlers a run for their money.  xD

28-07-2019T23:48:53,AspiringNoodle,"Record a video, upload to social media"
28-07-2019T23:49:06,AspiringNoodle,People LOVE racist old timers :ptv-snicker:
28-07-2019T23:49:07,Sclimshady,I was waiting to see if you were gonna say that or were being serious
28-07-2019T23:49:23,SpazztasticKiwi,my family is a bit more hands on
28-07-2019T23:49:38,SpazztasticKiwi,particularly with problems

28-07-2019T23:51:27,SpazztasticKiwi,"thing is, grandma used the wrong race word"

28-07-2019T23:55:10,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm over it
28-07-2019T23:55:51,Sclimshady,"Iv'e only been on military bases there, racism is pretty rare on those.  Save for jokes"
28-07-2019T23:56:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh boy then I hope this kid I ran across working at McDonald‚Äôs gets a wake up call
28-07-2019T23:56:43,AspiringNoodle,Jokes are something that should be allowed to be offensive
28-07-2019T23:57:03,SpazztasticKiwi,he saw Mark as my screensaver one day and there about was an impromptu funeral
28-07-2019T23:57:09,AspiringNoodle,"If you get offended, either that's the point, or learn to laugh at yourself"
28-07-2019T23:57:23,Sclimshady,You aint seen offensive till youve joked around with soldiers in private
28-07-2019T23:57:36,SpazztasticKiwi,same boy is now in the Guard
28-07-2019T23:57:46,Sclimshady,The cops were scared to come to our barracks
28-07-2019T23:58:04,Sclimshady,The guard is make believe Army
28-07-2019T23:58:18,SpazztasticKiwi,in theory he got the bs beat out of him
28-07-2019T23:58:31,SpazztasticKiwi,cause based on that day he was full of it
