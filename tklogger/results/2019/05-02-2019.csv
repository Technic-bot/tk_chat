05-02-2019T00:00:10,Bgrmystr2,"personally, I'd want a bedroom, an office, and a guest bedroom."
05-02-2019T00:00:16,Bgrmystr2,Most houses seem to not come with an office
05-02-2019T00:00:17,Ordithus,"""Bedrooms"" are also often a room to use as an office or guest room"
05-02-2019T00:00:20,Bgrmystr2,and call it a bedroom
05-02-2019T00:00:24,Bgrmystr2,yeah exactly ord
05-02-2019T00:00:27,Ordithus,"Yeah, what Bgr said"
05-02-2019T00:00:30,Bgrmystr2,haha
05-02-2019T00:00:38,Ordithus,:cw0lfmare-EmberTooHappy:
05-02-2019T00:00:45,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-laugh:
05-02-2019T00:01:22,Ordithus,"My place is a 2 bedroom.  If it wasn't for the basement, it'd be itty bitty"
05-02-2019T00:01:39,Bgrmystr2,we don't have basements here cuz swamp
05-02-2019T00:01:50,Bgrmystr2,but this new house is.. I think 3 bedroom
05-02-2019T00:01:59,Bgrmystr2,when an open front room
05-02-2019T00:02:17,Bgrmystr2,"I'm using the front room as a bedroom at the moment, but sometime soonish we'll convert it to an actual bedroom"
05-02-2019T00:02:23,Bgrmystr2,so it'll increase the value of the house.
05-02-2019T00:03:22,Ordithus,Eventually I want to add a bedroom to the basement here
05-02-2019T00:03:41,Ordithus,"Same reason, plus nice to have if say, I'm renting out the 2nd bedroom and have guests"
05-02-2019T00:03:54,Bgrmystr2,yeh
05-02-2019T00:04:08,Ordithus,We have basements because we have to dig down at least 6 feet to get below the frost line anyways
05-02-2019T00:04:18,Ordithus,Why fill that in when you can just use that space
05-02-2019T00:04:32,Bgrmystr2,you guys up there are lucky
05-02-2019T00:05:07,Bgrmystr2,"down here it's all swamp, so if you dig less than 10 inches or a few feet into the ground, you get water."
05-02-2019T00:05:11,Bgrmystr2,"depending on where you are, of course"
05-02-2019T00:05:27,Ordithus,"We can get water here, too.  My own house is evidence of that..."
05-02-2019T00:05:28,Bgrmystr2,lotta places below sea level
05-02-2019T00:05:45,Ordithus,Was less of a problem when the basement drainage drained into city storm sewers
05-02-2019T00:05:55,Bgrmystr2,we legit can't even create basements because the water table is right there.
05-02-2019T00:06:05,Bgrmystr2,feels bad :/
05-02-2019T00:06:10,Ordithus,Hmm
05-02-2019T00:06:22,Ordithus,"Like, you would have a pool under your house?"
05-02-2019T00:06:34,Bgrmystr2,most pools are above ground
05-02-2019T00:06:39,Ordithus,"But, you could?"
05-02-2019T00:06:45,Bgrmystr2,I mean..
05-02-2019T00:06:50,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-sleepoverA:
05-02-2019T00:06:54,Bgrmystr2,it'd be not great but..
05-02-2019T00:07:00,Bgrmystr2,technically..? :ptv-wondering:
05-02-2019T00:07:06,Ordithus,It's just ground water
05-02-2019T00:07:16,Bgrmystr2,it would also kind of damage the support of the house
05-02-2019T00:07:28,Bgrmystr2,and ground water here has the habit of keeping snakes and such
05-02-2019T00:07:36,Bgrmystr2,also mosquitos are a major problem
05-02-2019T00:07:38,Ordithus,And mold type problems
05-02-2019T00:07:40,Bgrmystr2,they're EVERYWHERE
05-02-2019T00:07:52,Bgrmystr2,"yah mold too, but that's just on top of everything else heh"
05-02-2019T00:07:57,Ordithus,"But, cold untreated swimming pool"
05-02-2019T00:08:09,Ordithus,The snakes are just bitey pool noodles
05-02-2019T00:08:18,Bgrmystr2,nooo
05-02-2019T00:08:25,Bgrmystr2,those are the most dangerous type of pool noodle
05-02-2019T00:08:31,Bgrmystr2,the ones that can kill you.
05-02-2019T00:08:37,Ordithus,Oh dear
05-02-2019T00:09:13,Ordithus,"Upon further examination, perhaps the under-house pool is not so great"
05-02-2019T00:09:24,Bgrmystr2,haha
05-02-2019T01:00:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Night Tom
05-02-2019T02:33:22,shamdow,this is a silly place to ask but i couldn't think of a better spot. has anyone else had trouble with Keenspot? I order volume 4 with the signed print and it hasnt been delivered yet. when i try to contact them i don't get a reply.
05-02-2019T02:34:01,shamdow,just wondering if anyone else had had to deal with this and how you delt with it
05-02-2019T02:38:40,Bgrmystr2,a lot of people have issues with keenspot not shipping. they seem to have had this issue for a very long time
05-02-2019T02:38:59,Bgrmystr2,sad to see it's still a problem now.
05-02-2019T02:39:57,Bgrmystr2,you can't really do much about it. Keenspot is probably swamped as always. Make sure to check and see if it's even shipped yet.
05-02-2019T02:40:51,Bgrmystr2,"the shipping doesn't seem to take long, but they seem to take quite a while to actually send stuff out."
05-02-2019T02:41:20,shamdow,It has been shipped. the problem is its stuck in the border and neither australia post nor usps claim to have it atm. its really annoying me
05-02-2019T02:42:20,Bgrmystr2,Sounds like that's not something Keenspot can do anything about for the time being.
05-02-2019T02:42:49,shamdow,i cant do anything either. australia post sayd they dont have it and usps says they dont have it anymore.
05-02-2019T02:42:59,shamdow,theres no border contact for postal items either
05-02-2019T02:44:03,Bgrmystr2,USPS wouldn't have it much if they ever had it at all. it would airmail from keenspot's shop directly to a austrailia. USPS is only a united states thing.
05-02-2019T02:44:15,Bgrmystr2,it might be in US customs
05-02-2019T02:44:57,shamdow,eh. have a look
05-02-2019T02:44:59,shamdow,https://keenspotshop.com/10780742/orders/6fe9c94934c78824d54355e5d44cfb53
05-02-2019T02:46:30,Bgrmystr2,daaamn $50 shipping
05-02-2019T02:46:33,Bgrmystr2,that's painful
05-02-2019T02:47:41,shamdow,yeah. in usd too. which is more expencive aswell
05-02-2019T02:48:33,Bgrmystr2,did USPS say it went into CBP?
05-02-2019T02:49:02,iliar,"I do not know how it works in Australia, but in Russia a postal item can be of indefinite status for a long time. When the posting left the United States, but did not arrive in Russia. Just wait."
05-02-2019T02:49:23,Bgrmystr2,"if it's not in US customs, it may be in Austrailia customs, whatever that is called."
05-02-2019T02:49:31,shamdow,https://tools.usps.com/go/TrackConfirmAction.action?tLabels=CJ481784240US
05-02-2019T02:49:33,shamdow,it is yeah
05-02-2019T02:50:35,iliar,"Yes, the shipping cost hurts."
05-02-2019T02:51:03,shamdow,"but yeah. ive been waiting, 4 months so far"
05-02-2019T02:51:54,Bgrmystr2,yeah you need to probably contact whatever the customs department of australia is
05-02-2019T02:52:38,Bgrmystr2,"Here in the US, Customs get packages that are imported, they screen it to make sure it's nothing bad, then give it off to whatever's going to deliver it."
05-02-2019T02:52:55,shamdow,thats how it should work here too
05-02-2019T02:52:58,Bgrmystr2,yeah
05-02-2019T02:53:23,Bgrmystr2,"so if your post office or whatnot hasn't gotten it, it's still in your import office.. somewhere. Someone has it."
05-02-2019T02:53:41,shamdow,yeah. with no way of contacting them about it
05-02-2019T02:53:49,Bgrmystr2,Here they don't actually track packages in their facilities.. which is dumb and irresponsible. :/
05-02-2019T02:53:53,Bgrmystr2,I guess it's the same for you
05-02-2019T02:54:22,shamdow,theres no department for it and they claim no responcibility and shrug it off to australia post (which they havent got it yet)
05-02-2019T02:54:51,Bgrmystr2,Pretty shitty since they are literally directly responsible for it..
05-02-2019T02:55:04,shamdow,yes.
05-02-2019T02:56:40,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, I guess all you can do is wait.. and keep calling. Eventually you'll hopefully get in contact with keenspot about it and tell them what's going on."
05-02-2019T02:57:14,shamdow,"""Australia Post is the carrier of international mail and has sole responsibility for delivery of your postal article. For enquiries regarding the delivery of your parcel, contact Australia Post on 13 13 18."""
05-02-2019T02:57:24,shamdow,its bs.
05-02-2019T02:57:51,shamdow,and yeah. im gonna have to just wait.. again.
05-02-2019T02:58:08,Bgrmystr2,"well, if they legally have responsibility of your package, all you can do is just keep calling up the post and ask them where it is."
05-02-2019T02:58:29,Bgrmystr2,remembering to remind them that your package is their responsibility to know where it is.
05-02-2019T02:59:01,Bgrmystr2,"Dunno, it's all just :fire:"
05-02-2019T02:59:06,shamdow,hahah ive done that. theyve been so kind to lodge (another) lost or missing mail form and still nothing.
05-02-2019T02:59:11,shamdow,that was a few months ago.
05-02-2019T02:59:16,shamdow,yeah.
05-02-2019T02:59:44,Bgrmystr2,Unfortunate. You guys have an equally trash mail system as we do.
05-02-2019T02:59:53,Bgrmystr2,I feel your pain.
05-02-2019T03:00:00,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-sad:

05-02-2019T03:01:02,Bgrmystr2,"if anything, you can always come back and talk to tom about it. I don't know if he'll be able to do anything about it though."
05-02-2019T03:01:13,shamdow,"yeah, probbably not."
05-02-2019T03:01:27,Bgrmystr2,he's talked to keenspot about orders like that before though
05-02-2019T03:01:35,Bgrmystr2,when they weren't responding to user emails
05-02-2019T03:01:38,Bgrmystr2,I've seen it a couple times now
05-02-2019T03:01:57,Bgrmystr2,so I mean.. it's worth a try
05-02-2019T03:02:06,shamdow,mhmm/ yeah but like as you said. not really in thier hands atm
05-02-2019T03:02:40,Bgrmystr2,"well, he's also shipped books himself personally to people that had theirs lost in the mail."
05-02-2019T03:02:58,Bgrmystr2,not all is lost. :v
05-02-2019T03:03:49,shamdow,"fuck it. yeah, worth a try."
05-02-2019T03:04:50,Bgrmystr2,He'll probably be hanging out here in the chat around 8 to 10 hrs from now
05-02-2019T03:04:52,Bgrmystr2,probably
05-02-2019T03:06:52,Bgrmystr2,"gotta go do some things, but I really hope you get everything sorted. :thumbsup:"
05-02-2019T03:07:17,shamdow,cheers. much appreciated.
