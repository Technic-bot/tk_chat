17-03-2019T00:57:41,Bgrmystr2,lol kiwi there's so many animes and you've only tried the mainstream.
17-03-2019T01:00:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Well I donâ€™t generally have the time
17-03-2019T01:01:03,SpazztasticKiwi,And Iâ€™m easily bored
17-03-2019T01:01:23,Bgrmystr2,lolo
17-03-2019T01:01:37,SpazztasticKiwi,If it doesnâ€™t interest me in the first few minutes Iâ€™m out
17-03-2019T01:02:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Meantime I can watch Mark ramble on about literally nothing in particular for a decent span of time
17-03-2019T01:03:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Logic does not always keep company with me
17-03-2019T01:07:34,Bgrmystr2,"yeah that's not how you watch shows. Shows can't give you instant gratification, that's not how any of em work xD"
17-03-2019T01:07:53,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, some do, but they're just catering to kids and don't have a proper plot or anything with depth"
17-03-2019T01:15:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Iâ€™ll watch how I please
17-03-2019T01:15:29,SpazztasticKiwi,But now Iâ€™m to ðŸ›Œ

17-03-2019T14:10:16,CrimsonQuill,That is the biggest PNG file I've seen Tom make.
17-03-2019T14:11:19,Bgrmystr2,gotta lurk more then
17-03-2019T14:11:29,Bgrmystr2,that's the actual resolution he makes the images
17-03-2019T14:11:36,Bgrmystr2,he just uploads them in a smaller size usually
17-03-2019T14:11:44,CrimsonQuill,"Oh,"
17-03-2019T14:11:45,Bgrmystr2,"so that one was just accident, but now it's too late :v"
17-03-2019T14:11:49,CrimsonQuill,I'm glad.
17-03-2019T14:11:56,CrimsonQuill,I like the full size images.
17-03-2019T14:11:59,CrimsonQuill,Every time.
17-03-2019T14:12:04,CrimsonQuill,Maximum quality.

17-03-2019T14:12:15,Bgrmystr2,yup
17-03-2019T14:12:46,CrimsonQuill,"Do you think he might repeat this ""accident"" and/or update previous pics at original sizes?"
17-03-2019T14:12:51,CrimsonQuill,:ctwokinds-maevecute:
17-03-2019T14:13:35,CrimsonQuill,"Because suddenly I'd like to see Tail Nap, Halo Raine, Sniper Kat and suchlike in full size."
17-03-2019T14:13:45,CrimsonQuill,To blazes with the storage space needed.
17-03-2019T14:15:35,Bgrmystr2,No he won't update anything.
17-03-2019T14:15:49,CrimsonQuill,You're right...
17-03-2019T14:15:52,Bgrmystr2,"like I said, it was an accident and it only happens every so often."
17-03-2019T14:16:02,CrimsonQuill,But at least it happened here.
17-03-2019T14:16:13,CrimsonQuill,Because this is a damned good picture.
17-03-2019T14:26:32,Mippy,:ctwokinds-nibsbounce: itâ€™s legit warm out!

17-03-2019T15:54:37,mingun,"@Twokinds May I have question? I noticed that my suggestion about Laura's sister not appears on poll. Has it reached you? I mean, maybe it was inappropriate some way and I should't send it again in the next round. Or it just exceeded some limit?"
17-03-2019T15:54:50,mingun,*On last poll/
17-03-2019T16:16:41,Twokinds,It wasn't in the poll because you had a suggestion fulfilled already last week.
17-03-2019T16:18:24,TerraTheWizard,~cooldown week~

17-03-2019T16:19:16,Twokinds,"Often, I can't say why I can't draw it, simply because... saying why might be a spoiler."
