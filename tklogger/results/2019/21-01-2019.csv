21-01-2019T14:46:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Why don’t I believe you got that close to a squirrel
21-01-2019T14:47:05,Twokinds,Just a cute squirrel picture I came across.
21-01-2019T14:47:43,Twokinds,"Not a pic of mine, that would require going outside."
21-01-2019T15:08:55,TorqueEmUp,Red squirrels are also not native anywhere in the U.S
21-01-2019T15:12:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Duh
21-01-2019T15:12:38,Twokinds,They're so cute though!
21-01-2019T15:12:46,Twokinds,The ears
21-01-2019T15:12:50,CrimsonQuill,"Yeah, I love red squirrels."
21-01-2019T15:12:50,SpazztasticKiwi,They’re apparently mean
21-01-2019T15:12:59,CrimsonQuill,They're a lot nicer than the grey ones.

21-01-2019T15:14:48,TorqueEmUp,I'd honestly have a squirrel as a pet if they were domesticated. lol
21-01-2019T15:14:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Angry chipmunk is something else to behold tho
21-01-2019T15:15:32,TorqueEmUp,"But I have to settle for pet ratties, which are also cute."

21-01-2019T15:18:37,SpazztasticKiwi,My sister had a rat before I was born
21-01-2019T15:18:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Or something like that
21-01-2019T15:18:55,SpazztasticKiwi,He was Oreo colored
21-01-2019T15:19:01,SpazztasticKiwi,guess his name
21-01-2019T15:20:52,TorqueEmUp,heh
21-01-2019T15:21:18,SpazztasticKiwi,They had to get rid of him. He was attracting other rats
21-01-2019T15:21:27,SpazztasticKiwi,I believe some thirsty rat ladies
21-01-2019T15:21:59,CrimsonQuill,"I was cleaning out our garage, and found a decomposed rat under some rubbish..."

21-01-2019T15:22:42,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve had hamsters and gerbils
21-01-2019T15:24:32,TorqueEmUp,"Rats have such a negative social stigma, it's sad."
21-01-2019T15:25:29,SpazztasticKiwi,I wouldn’t mind a rat. My sister likely wouldn’t mind having another one. But Bagheera has a mad hunting instinct
21-01-2019T15:26:09,TorqueEmUp,"yeah, unless a cat has grown up around rats and knows how to be friendly with them, you don't get pet rats."
21-01-2019T15:26:17,TorqueEmUp,If you have a cat
21-01-2019T15:27:12,SpazztasticKiwi,The other cats have never bothered any small pets but Bagheera’s....a touch above “homing missile”
21-01-2019T15:27:50,CrimsonQuill,Rats are a very real problem for us.
21-01-2019T15:28:13,SpazztasticKiwi,"Though my moms old cat who went missing (ancient thing) could catch baby bunnies, baby chipmunks, and even a squirrel or two"
21-01-2019T15:28:16,CrimsonQuill,"They eat out of the duck's feeder at home, and steal stuff on my aunt's farm."
21-01-2019T15:28:34,CrimsonQuill,"Although, on my aunt's farm, there are 5 cats to keep the numbers doewn."
21-01-2019T15:28:46,CrimsonQuill,Two of which have refined their hunting to needle point.
21-01-2019T15:29:00,SpazztasticKiwi,"And she’s drop them on the steps, or get caught with them, still alive"
21-01-2019T15:29:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"“Here’s dinner.” “Cupcake, no”"
21-01-2019T15:29:46,TorqueEmUp,"Ehh just like any creature trying to stay alive, they are going to invade into people's homes."
21-01-2019T15:30:17,CrimsonQuill,"Have you ever read ""The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents""?"
21-01-2019T15:30:55,TorqueEmUp,"Honestly if you have rats getting into your home, you got some serious holes you need patched up."
21-01-2019T15:31:18,CrimsonQuill,Not home
21-01-2019T15:31:40,CrimsonQuill,But outside
21-01-2019T15:31:44,CrimsonQuill,Food storage for animals
21-01-2019T15:33:08,TorqueEmUp,"Rats unfortunately live very short lives, my two boys just recently passed away, only a week apart from each other. only 2 and a half years old."
21-01-2019T15:57:08,SpazztasticKiwi,I have get some small animals that sometimes live much longer than they’re supposed to
21-01-2019T15:57:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Like a gerbil that lived almost 5ish years
21-01-2019T15:59:03,SpazztasticKiwi,She liked mealworms
21-01-2019T16:20:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Didn’t you say you had lil critters Tom
21-01-2019T16:21:03,Twokinds,Holly?
21-01-2019T16:21:21,Twokinds,She's not very little. She's pretty fat.
21-01-2019T16:21:23,CrimsonQuill,Holly? Who or what is Holly?
21-01-2019T16:21:26,CrimsonQuill,A cat?
21-01-2019T16:21:28,CrimsonQuill,A dog?
21-01-2019T16:21:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Hamsters.
21-01-2019T16:21:35,CrimsonQuill,Oh.
21-01-2019T16:21:38,Twokinds,"No, I don't have any other pets."
21-01-2019T16:21:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Holly is lil in her own way
21-01-2019T16:21:49,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t mean now
21-01-2019T16:21:58,Twokinds,"I had hampsters once, back in college."
21-01-2019T16:22:12,SpazztasticKiwi,hampsters. They do their own laundry
21-01-2019T16:25:29,Twokinds,I wish
21-01-2019T16:26:55,SpazztasticKiwi,You’d like a pet hamster if it’d do your laundry
21-01-2019T16:28:19,SpazztasticKiwi,"Though if you stay home all the time, there’s no need for laundry - just stay in a robe"
21-01-2019T16:28:31,Twokinds,Robes need to be washed
21-01-2019T16:28:53,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s less that washing a week of clothes
21-01-2019T16:28:57,SpazztasticKiwi,than

21-01-2019T16:44:02,CrimsonQuill,Nero's a black labrador-collie cross. He loves to invade my bedroom.
21-01-2019T16:45:59,CrimsonQuill,Oh-Be right back
21-01-2019T16:52:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Do I take nap then take out Peekas food to thaw or take it out after and let it thaw asi install my new bathroom shelf
21-01-2019T16:52:30,SpazztasticKiwi,A maid. That’s what your assistants for
21-01-2019T16:55:42,Twokinds,I need an Alexa robot maid

21-01-2019T17:42:35,ThingsAreMoving,possibly both.

21-01-2019T17:49:45,ThingsAreMoving,They seem like a 'happy noodle' animal type

21-01-2019T21:46:45,Twokinds,You're probably right
21-01-2019T21:49:07,RimaDraws,^^
21-01-2019T22:26:14,Dadrobit,Oh I am fucking livid.
21-01-2019T22:26:52,Dadrobit,Got my first check from my courier job from the last two weeks just now and somebody done fucked up.
21-01-2019T22:27:09,Dadrobit,Supposed to be $15 an hour.
21-01-2019T22:27:10,SpazztasticKiwi,That sounds like a rough night
21-01-2019T22:27:17,Dadrobit,They've on;y paid $11.
21-01-2019T22:27:20,Dadrobit,only*
21-01-2019T22:27:30,TorqueEmUp,Ouch
21-01-2019T22:28:17,SpazztasticKiwi,And Holly surely would love to relocate to a new bathroom
21-01-2019T22:28:22,Dadrobit,Missing out on well over a hundred bucks ouch.
21-01-2019T22:28:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Did they put the $15/hr in writing to you?
21-01-2019T22:29:01,Dadrobit,"Yes, it was stipulated on my contract."
21-01-2019T22:29:05,TorqueEmUp,"Reminds me of my first check at my last security job, where I got only paid for one week, because someone entering the payroll fucked up."
21-01-2019T22:29:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Take that to em. You could probably even take em to court
21-01-2019T22:29:42,Bgrmystr2,"with a contract, yes."
21-01-2019T22:29:45,Bgrmystr2,absolutely
21-01-2019T22:30:25,TorqueEmUp,"Yeah good luck, just try to get them to sort it out politely at first."
21-01-2019T22:30:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Though make sure there’s no “discretion by employer may apply” kind of thing in it
21-01-2019T22:30:43,TorqueEmUp,Taking them to court is a sure fire way not to get hired ever again.
21-01-2019T22:31:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Well if they’re shorting people they shouldn’t be hiring at all
21-01-2019T22:31:18,Bgrmystr2,"not always, because the court case will put those who hired in the bad spotlight"
21-01-2019T22:31:19,Dadrobit,"Yeah, not gonna go straight to a lawyer over a couple hundred bucks. Especially not since my sister is under their permanant employ."
21-01-2019T22:31:22,SpazztasticKiwi,And you don’t return to that bull
21-01-2019T22:31:51,Dadrobit,Just gonna go in with the check and my contract and sort it out in person.
21-01-2019T22:31:54,TorqueEmUp,It's probably just a typo
21-01-2019T22:35:07,TorqueEmUp,I need to read Steve Gallacci's stuff sometime
