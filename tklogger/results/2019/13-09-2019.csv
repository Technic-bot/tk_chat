13-09-2019T00:00:08,unsteddyphoenix,9*11 is 99 which doesnt equal 9
13-09-2019T00:00:15,Ordithus,I don't even know anymore
13-09-2019T00:00:20,Mikemkke034,Oh boy...
13-09-2019T00:00:37,SageSaga,and 10x9 is 90 and 9 isnt 90

13-09-2019T00:00:52,SageSaga,all you need is the single digits to know how to multiply into larger numbers
13-09-2019T00:00:59,unsteddyphoenix,9+0=9?

13-09-2019T00:01:32,SageSaga,when you learn your multiplication tables- you dont learn everything past 10
13-09-2019T00:01:41,SageSaga,you dont need to- you only need to know 0-9

13-09-2019T00:02:22,BadFoMo,I only went up to 10.
13-09-2019T00:02:30,SageSaga,why would you learn up to 12? if you were taught math you dont need to know it
13-09-2019T00:03:19,unsteddyphoenix,gotta be 2 better than the americans I guess
13-09-2019T00:03:23,Ordithus,My school also went to 12
13-09-2019T00:03:31,BadFoMo,11 and 12 show the repeating pattern?
13-09-2019T00:03:41,Ordithus,"But i never memorized the table, I just learned how to multiply"
13-09-2019T00:04:05,SageSaga,the point of the tables is to learn the basics- 11 and 12 would be the application

13-09-2019T00:05:38,SageSaga,12.5 would have broken too many students

13-09-2019T01:49:17,Dadrobit,Going back to a 9-5 made my weekends finally matter again. It's kinda nice in a way.
13-09-2019T01:49:26,Dadrobit,"Doing okay, rima, thanks."
13-09-2019T01:49:49,RimaDraws,thats good. like the security job?
13-09-2019T01:50:13,RimaDraws,if i recall that right
13-09-2019T01:50:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Sage I found a beautiful allergies clip I’d love to show you one day if you want
13-09-2019T01:50:21,Dadrobit,"Though, to be fair to myself, I didn't get last weekend off. Had to cover a pair of 12's because a dude quit out of the blue."
13-09-2019T01:50:34,SageSaga,allergies clip? wth?
13-09-2019T01:50:43,Dadrobit,"Yepper, security."
13-09-2019T01:50:50,RimaDraws,i bet thats fun
13-09-2019T01:51:37,SageSaga,how is a security job fun?
13-09-2019T01:51:39,Dadrobit,99% of the time is boring. 1% of the time I get to deal with aggressive assholes and bridesmaids getting leg swept by a fire marshall.
13-09-2019T01:51:46,RimaDraws,lol
13-09-2019T01:52:03,RimaDraws,i would have loved to seen that
13-09-2019T01:52:31,Dadrobit,10/10. Best night since I've been back that was.
13-09-2019T01:52:39,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s basically just a falling tree
13-09-2019T01:52:50,RimaDraws,i bet it was a laughing sight
13-09-2019T01:53:43,Dadrobit,It was pretty great. Then she got swarmed by like a dozen cops and the sheriff. Don't think she actually got arrested though.
13-09-2019T01:53:56,SpazztasticKiwi,maybe I’ll throw it in when you’re done
13-09-2019T01:53:56,AspiringNoodle,I wouldn't be surprised
13-09-2019T01:54:01,AspiringNoodle,"She was drunk and stupid, lol"
13-09-2019T01:54:11,Dadrobit,Yuuuuup
13-09-2019T01:54:15,ZRO4825,"Welp, just found Zinogre o_o;; Had kinda forgotten it was a thing."
13-09-2019T01:54:37,AspiringNoodle,RIP you
13-09-2019T01:54:42,SageSaga,electro dogo
13-09-2019T01:54:49,ZRO4825,Oh I'm sure I'll cart a few times. XD
13-09-2019T01:54:57,Dadrobit,"Because the fireworks setting the grass on fire ""RUINED"" the wedding. Gotta go around fucking with the fire marshal"
13-09-2019T01:54:59,AspiringNoodle,"dad, do you like the fact that your job is 9-5 again, or that your schedule is more consistent?"
13-09-2019T01:55:06,SageSaga,just kill it Zro
13-09-2019T01:55:19,ZRO4825,I will once they let me D:
13-09-2019T01:55:28,AspiringNoodle,KILL IT WITH FIRE
13-09-2019T01:55:30,ZRO4825,They made me find it and then it ran away from the locale.
13-09-2019T01:55:38,AspiringNoodle,Wait... does MH follow avatar rules?
13-09-2019T01:55:44,AspiringNoodle,Does lightning = fire resistance?
13-09-2019T01:55:54,SageSaga,no
13-09-2019T01:55:59,AspiringNoodle,Then again I say
13-09-2019T01:56:02,AspiringNoodle,KILL IT WITH FIRE
13-09-2019T01:56:14,Dadrobit,"It's bittersweet. It's still a graveyard shift, so my day life isn't normal, but getting a regular paycheck is really comforting."
13-09-2019T01:56:27,SageSaga,it's weak to Ice
13-09-2019T01:56:51,Dadrobit,'Specially since they made me a supervisor so my pay is much higher than when I left them before.
13-09-2019T01:56:52,ZRO4825,"Oh, in that case I have a giant frozen fish I can beat on it with."
13-09-2019T01:56:59,AspiringNoodle,"Uuuuuuh, kill it with fire so cold it burns?"
13-09-2019T01:57:29,Dadrobit,"Last weekend sucked working overtime, but he'll, that's like an extra $600 for two days of work."
13-09-2019T01:57:40,AspiringNoodle,O_O
13-09-2019T01:57:42,AspiringNoodle,Moneeeeeeeeeeey
13-09-2019T01:57:58,RimaDraws,lol
13-09-2019T01:58:26,Dadrobit,"Working voice over was fun as hell and I'm still doing as much as I can, but the money just wasn't stable."
13-09-2019T01:58:28,SageSaga,https://www.patreon.com/yosh
13-09-2019T01:58:30,AspiringNoodle,"Meanwhile, the gas station where I work only allows 1 person to work nights, and doesn't pay extra for it :/"
13-09-2019T01:58:34,SageSaga,totally unrelated <_< >_>
13-09-2019T01:58:40,RimaDraws,lol
13-09-2019T01:58:43,Dadrobit,Hahahahahaha
13-09-2019T01:58:44,AspiringNoodle,"Ooooo, what's this link do?"
13-09-2019T01:58:49,RimaDraws,speaking of comics
13-09-2019T01:59:00,RimaDraws,i need to catch up on the last two pages of AI
13-09-2019T01:59:32,Dadrobit,I'll toss some your way sage when I get home. I don't let my finances touch my phone.
13-09-2019T01:59:40,AspiringNoodle,smart man
13-09-2019T01:59:53,RimaDraws,i may try to support as well if i can
13-09-2019T02:00:01,AspiringNoodle,"btw, does your job pay extra for graveyard?"
13-09-2019T02:00:16,SageSaga,my patreon funds have been slipping lately- its very hard to survive on 700 dollars a month
13-09-2019T02:00:34,ZRO4825,:(
13-09-2019T02:00:36,Dadrobit,"No, grave is the same as day."
13-09-2019T02:00:44,AspiringNoodle,Dang
13-09-2019T02:00:54,AspiringNoodle,Was hoping you'd get some sweet night time cash
13-09-2019T02:01:16,Dadrobit,And the guards are all payed exactly the same with no options for raises.
13-09-2019T02:01:22,AspiringNoodle,...
13-09-2019T02:01:42,AspiringNoodle,And this is guard duty for a wealthy neighborhood?
13-09-2019T02:01:50,Dadrobit,Very.
13-09-2019T02:02:00,AspiringNoodle,"Pretty much sums up America, lmao"
13-09-2019T02:02:33,Dadrobit,It pays well for security though at least
13-09-2019T02:02:37,AspiringNoodle,Or would that be capitalism at its free-est? :thinking:
13-09-2019T02:03:04,Dadrobit,"Most gigs are 10 or 11, this is 14.50."
13-09-2019T02:03:23,AspiringNoodle,Very nice
13-09-2019T02:03:26,Dadrobit,Being a supervisor gets me an extra 50%.
13-09-2019T02:03:32,AspiringNoodle,double nice
13-09-2019T02:03:39,AspiringNoodle,Or nice and a half? xD
13-09-2019T02:05:00,SageSaga,double?
13-09-2019T02:05:46,AspiringNoodle,"Well, I'm going to go to bed"
13-09-2019T02:05:46,SageSaga,well you corrected yourself - so you dont have to go back to middle school
13-09-2019T02:05:53,SageSaga,gnight XD
13-09-2019T02:06:06,AspiringNoodle,"To be fair, either of those would work :P"
13-09-2019T02:06:21,Dadrobit,"I mean, I suppose I make a bit more than double the average guard."
13-09-2019T02:06:32,Dadrobit,o/ noodle
13-09-2019T02:07:33,Dadrobit,At least until the robots replace me >.>
13-09-2019T02:08:35,Dadrobit,Another agency I worked for was/is rolling out mobile security robots. They're legit daleks.
13-09-2019T02:09:15,SageSaga,ive seen those before
13-09-2019T02:09:38,SageSaga,"one of them ""Committed suicide"" in DC"
13-09-2019T02:10:01,Dadrobit,"Hahahaha, yeah, waltzed into a fountain. I remember that."
13-09-2019T02:10:19,SageSaga,did you see that it was bullied?
13-09-2019T02:10:34,Dadrobit,No???
13-09-2019T02:10:58,SageSaga,it's video footage showed people would kick it and hit it with objects
13-09-2019T02:11:05,Dadrobit,:(
13-09-2019T02:11:37,SageSaga,"people were like ""No wonder it ended it all, when will people learn robots are people too?"""

13-09-2019T07:44:07,SniperJackal,And that was about a year ago
13-09-2019T07:52:33,CrimsonQuill,Nice to see you Jackal
13-09-2019T07:52:42,CrimsonQuill,I understand the idea
13-09-2019T07:52:53,CrimsonQuill,I must have re-read the comic about 4-5 times this year.
13-09-2019T07:53:11,CrimsonQuill,And i plan on doing it again at Christmas if I reach a personal goal...
13-09-2019T08:21:27,SniperJackal,and what is that :o
13-09-2019T08:21:56,CrimsonQuill,"Well, like I said, it's personal."
13-09-2019T08:22:00,SniperJackal,okay
13-09-2019T08:22:04,SniperJackal,I understand
13-09-2019T08:22:16,CrimsonQuill,"But if I reach it, then during my holidays, I will sit down, chillax, and read it all through."
13-09-2019T08:22:18,CrimsonQuill,Again.
13-09-2019T08:22:28,CrimsonQuill,And then...leave off the constant rereads for a bit.
13-09-2019T08:22:30,SniperJackal,However I am a bit anxious about rereading everything
13-09-2019T08:22:57,SniperJackal,The emotions man
13-09-2019T08:23:05,CrimsonQuill,That's often the reason I do it
13-09-2019T08:23:07,CrimsonQuill,Although...
13-09-2019T08:23:12,SniperJackal,It can be exhausting
13-09-2019T08:23:18,CrimsonQuill,I always find the first few chapters a bit tricky
13-09-2019T08:23:21,SniperJackal,Especially the Laura dying part
13-09-2019T08:24:14,SniperJackal,"Yeah the first chapters are well, obviously not that great"
13-09-2019T08:24:39,SniperJackal,"I dont know what kept me going the first time I read it, to read through the first pages"
13-09-2019T08:24:47,CrimsonQuill,I think Tom's themes really started to shine through in chapter 7 though.
13-09-2019T08:25:11,SniperJackal,There s something special about his comic
13-09-2019T08:25:25,CrimsonQuill,"Well, let's face it, we all start somewhere."
13-09-2019T08:25:29,SniperJackal,I tried reading a few other similar ones and I didnt get inerested in them
13-09-2019T08:25:41,SniperJackal,Well yeah obviously
13-09-2019T08:25:53,CrimsonQuill,And look at what it is now.
13-09-2019T08:26:08,CrimsonQuill,I find some parts of the first 6 chapters quite good.
13-09-2019T08:26:56,SniperJackal,I had to check chapter 6
13-09-2019T08:27:15,CrimsonQuill,Oh BTW
13-09-2019T08:27:29,CrimsonQuill,"Any more progress on RvB, or is it a bit busy?"
13-09-2019T08:27:47,SniperJackal,Idk im not in the mood for it
13-09-2019T08:27:59,SniperJackal,first 2 weeks of school
13-09-2019T08:28:11,CrimsonQuill,Oh ok
13-09-2019T08:28:12,CrimsonQuill,Well
13-09-2019T08:28:12,SniperJackal,and I mostly just play games with friends
13-09-2019T08:28:47,CrimsonQuill,Whenever you feel like it anyhow.
13-09-2019T08:29:04,CrimsonQuill,"Actually, I wonder how Church'd deal with Sniper Jackals! XD"
13-09-2019T08:29:25,SniperJackal,hm
13-09-2019T08:29:30,SniperJackal,I would rather send caboose
13-09-2019T08:29:53,SniperJackal,He deals with impossible situations the best
13-09-2019T08:29:57,CrimsonQuill,That is true.
13-09-2019T08:30:07,CrimsonQuill,Maybe he'd make pancakes with them.
13-09-2019T08:30:15,CrimsonQuill,Or you could tell him that their on his team....
13-09-2019T08:31:24,CrimsonQuill,"Just use the good ol' ""CTRL+F+U on them!"
13-09-2019T08:31:26,SniperJackal,Or he would feed them seeds
13-09-2019T08:31:43,SniperJackal,They kinda look like birds anyways
13-09-2019T08:31:46,CrimsonQuill,...Is that because they kind of look like birds?...
13-09-2019T08:31:50,CrimsonQuill,Called it
13-09-2019T08:31:50,SniperJackal,yes
13-09-2019T08:31:59,SniperJackal,except the halo 4 and 5 jackals
13-09-2019T08:32:26,CrimsonQuill,I like those ones
13-09-2019T08:32:32,CrimsonQuill,They look so much more Feral.
13-09-2019T08:32:51,SniperJackal,they look kinda like dinos
13-09-2019T08:33:17,CrimsonQuill,gtg

13-09-2019T13:09:30,AspiringNoodle,I'm questioning sticking around at the gas station
13-09-2019T13:09:46,AspiringNoodle,I'm giving it 2 more weeks before I request to be given less time
13-09-2019T13:10:05,AspiringNoodle,We have full time employees working less hours than I am
13-09-2019T13:10:13,CrRAR,Remember on your resume you're a Gas Distribution Specialist!
13-09-2019T13:10:32,CrRAR,with a passion for mechanical analysis!

13-09-2019T13:10:42,CrRAR,xD
13-09-2019T13:10:55,Sclimshady,Our gas station just started closing at night cause they have no employees.  It makes working at night annoying
13-09-2019T13:10:56,AspiringNoodle,And the store is getting alcohol later this year
13-09-2019T13:11:11,CrRAR,"Oh great, beware the drunkies."
13-09-2019T13:11:29,AspiringNoodle,I want to complain that $9.50 an hour isn't enough for all the crap they want us to do during a shift
13-09-2019T13:11:43,AspiringNoodle,But considering security gets $10 - $11 an hour makes it seem like we're overpaid
13-09-2019T13:12:02,CrRAR,Make sure they supply you with a flamethrower for bathroom duty.
13-09-2019T13:12:03,Sclimshady,9.50 isnt enough to just sit in the store
13-09-2019T13:12:27,CrRAR,Does your place have a Dunkin Donuts or coffeshop inside?
13-09-2019T13:12:42,AspiringNoodle,"We do have a coffee bar, and the store is relatively nice"
13-09-2019T13:12:54,AspiringNoodle,It's just small compared to places like Sheetz that are within 5 minutes driving distance
13-09-2019T13:13:29,AspiringNoodle,"And seriously, we need more employees!"
13-09-2019T13:13:53,AspiringNoodle,"When your part time and full time staff basically work the same hours (and in case of part-time even more), your hiring situation is SNAFU"
13-09-2019T13:15:02,CrRAR,Yeah usually high availability businesses have a bigger pool of employees to keep things flexible.
13-09-2019T13:15:13,AspiringNoodle,I'm just waiting for the modern economy to burst because corporations focus so heavily on the numbers that all other sectors of the business suffer :/
13-09-2019T13:15:43,CrimsonQuill,"Numbers, numbers...what's it matter in the end?"
13-09-2019T13:15:47,CrRAR,Yeah the focus too much nowadays is: CHEAP! CHEAP! CHEAP!
13-09-2019T13:15:50,AspiringNoodle,"And our biggest issue right now is that they want the gas station to be 24/7, but they only allow a single person to work at night"
13-09-2019T13:16:08,CrRAR,"Cheap is never good, and often just a hassle."
13-09-2019T13:16:16,AspiringNoodle,"There's no extra pay to incentivize that shift, AND it's the only time our store has been robbed"
13-09-2019T13:16:37,AspiringNoodle,"So: Shit hours, no extra pay, increased chance of being held at gun / knifepoint.  What incentive is there for somebody to take that shift?"
13-09-2019T13:16:37,CrRAR,When you shop for something as a consumer the cheapest option is always garbage.
13-09-2019T13:16:45,CrRAR,"yeh, that sucks"
13-09-2019T13:16:59,CrRAR,I wish business decision makers would understand that.

13-09-2019T13:20:03,AspiringNoodle,But then their numbers started dipping because the store was being used for online returns

13-09-2019T13:20:19,AspiringNoodle,"But corporate didn't count online sales in the area towards that store's numbers, only the returns"
13-09-2019T13:20:29,CrimsonQuill,Because people will eventually backlash.
13-09-2019T13:20:36,CrRAR,yup
13-09-2019T13:20:44,CrimsonQuill,ANd the companies would have to change for the better....
13-09-2019T13:20:50,CrimsonQuill,...right?
13-09-2019T13:20:51,AspiringNoodle,"So they saw, ""Oh shit, people are returning a lot of stuff to this store!""  So they considered it underperforming, and cut the number of employees back to 4"

13-09-2019T13:27:25,AspiringNoodle,The level of multitasking is just exhausting
13-09-2019T13:32:03,CrRAR,One thing that disturbs me greatly lately seems to be the lack of managers understanding what their employees fully do.
13-09-2019T13:32:58,CrRAR,I think as that trend increases things get increasingly dangerous.
13-09-2019T13:33:51,CrRAR,If you're self motivated and not lazy and have good instincts it is good. More hands-off.
13-09-2019T13:34:37,CrimsonQuill,Weeellll...I definitely need work on being 'not lazy'.
13-09-2019T13:35:09,CrRAR,"...but it opens the door for more plausible deniability systemically and can create problems where a decision is made that no one person makes, and suddenly the ship is alarmingly off course toward dangerous waters."
13-09-2019T13:35:30,CrRAR,lol crimson
13-09-2019T13:36:28,CrimsonQuill,Weeeell. I do have a 'head in the sand' proble
13-09-2019T13:36:30,CrimsonQuill,problem
13-09-2019T13:36:52,CrimsonQuill,I've never really got out of the habit of hoping a problem just goes away if I don't pay attention to it.
13-09-2019T13:37:12,CrRAR,yup
13-09-2019T13:37:15,AspiringNoodle,"I like my manager, it's just annoying because corporate is cracking down on a lot of things"
13-09-2019T13:37:47,AspiringNoodle,"And combine that with the fact that I have now worked mostly full time weeks as a part time employee since being hired, and consider me annoyed"
13-09-2019T13:38:32,AspiringNoodle,here's my scheduled hours since I've been hired
13-09-2019T13:38:39,CrRAR,"Yeah, we have a corporate, but were a small subsidiary, and the vibes coming from them are scary."
13-09-2019T13:38:50,AspiringNoodle,31 - 28 - 35 - 35 - 35 - 35 (weeks 4 and 5 I didn't work those hours due to illness)
13-09-2019T13:39:27,AspiringNoodle,"I'm giving it 2 more weeks, and if I don't get less hours, I'm asking my manager to cut my hours back.  Easiest way?  Just cut a day off."
13-09-2019T13:39:44,AspiringNoodle,"Might drop me below 30 hours a week, but I still consider that preferable :/"
13-09-2019T13:40:26,AspiringNoodle,"Ofc, I need to review our policy on health insurance to see if I'd be eligible at all if I drop below that magic 30 number"
13-09-2019T13:40:50,AspiringNoodle,"But seriously, I should not be working more hours than some full time employees!!!"
13-09-2019T13:41:27,CrRAR,"Yeah, same boat somewhat here, literally been correcting old mistakes of a past regime for two years straight."
13-09-2019T13:42:31,CrimsonQuill,I literally won't know what I am doing until Tuesday.
13-09-2019T13:43:03,CrimsonQuill,I am hoping against hope that I can get back to my studies.
13-09-2019T13:43:09,CrimsonQuill,I made too many mistakes last year.
13-09-2019T13:43:18,CrimsonQuill,That cannot happen again.
13-09-2019T13:43:31,CrRAR,yeah
13-09-2019T13:44:15,CrRAR,"Most scary, is corporate cares not about how WELL a place runs, just that it runs cheaply."
13-09-2019T13:44:25,CrRAR,Explains most middle managers these days.
13-09-2019T13:45:00,CrRAR,They got promoted because they were oblivious to a piece of their responsibilities that they let wither
13-09-2019T13:45:22,CrRAR,"hence, they save money, while pretending that a problem doesn't exist."
13-09-2019T13:45:35,CrRAR,Upper management celebrates
13-09-2019T13:45:42,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
13-09-2019T13:45:45,CrimsonQuill,Like Mr Kornada from Freefall?
13-09-2019T13:46:35,CrRAR,exactly
13-09-2019T13:46:36,CrRAR,lol
13-09-2019T13:47:21,CrRAR,so when the time comes and all their good staff leave or are scapegoated... this happens...
13-09-2019T13:47:29,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-keith8D:*[Did you guys remember to steer the ship?]
13-09-2019T13:47:32,CrRAR,[Left!]*:ctwokinds-keith8D:[Right?]*:ctwokinds-keith8D::ctwokinds-keith8D:*[I made pancakes!]
13-09-2019T13:47:44,CrimsonQuill,XD
13-09-2019T13:48:09,CrRAR,The pancakes guy gets the raise
13-09-2019T13:53:57,CrimsonQuill,Yep
13-09-2019T13:54:02,CrimsonQuill,Just finished colouring in Raine
13-09-2019T13:54:07,CrimsonQuill,Well
13-09-2019T13:54:16,CrRAR,:D
13-09-2019T13:54:23,CrimsonQuill,"Kinda iffy on how I shaded her hair, but it's a first time."
13-09-2019T13:54:50,CrimsonQuill,"My friend has told me to just go ahead with things, that Tom probably would be okay with that sort of stuff..."
13-09-2019T13:55:16,CrimsonQuill,"But I keep telling myself that I need to ask his permission...that I need, as TV tropes puts it, the 'Approval of God'."
13-09-2019T13:55:49,CrimsonQuill,So I check my inbox every 10 minutes searching for a reply...I must be mad.
13-09-2019T13:55:55,CrimsonQuill,Stark Raving Mad.
13-09-2019T13:56:24,CrRAR,Raine in armor is a sight to see.
13-09-2019T13:56:31,CrRAR,Natural born warrior.
13-09-2019T13:59:41,BadFoMo,Yo.
13-09-2019T13:59:58,SageSaga,yo
13-09-2019T14:00:04,AnuSekaniArt,Helloooooo :)
13-09-2019T14:00:14,FoxxTrotter,:cfoxxtrotter-CatEyes::cfoxxtrotter-SlyCool::cfoxxtrotter-CatEyes:
13-09-2019T14:00:26,CrimsonQuill,"Hey, FoMo. Foxx, Sage, Anu"
13-09-2019T14:00:34,CrRAR,ello ello errybody
13-09-2019T14:00:40,CrimsonQuill,"Technically, I didn't draw her in her armour...."
13-09-2019T14:00:42,TeapotOfDoom,stumbles into stream
13-09-2019T14:00:47,CrimsonQuill,I drew her in a bodysuit.
13-09-2019T14:00:49,TeapotOfDoom,Hi there!
13-09-2019T14:00:51,CrimsonQuill,Hello Teapot!
13-09-2019T14:00:56,CrimsonQuill,A Spartan Undersuit
13-09-2019T14:01:03,CrimsonQuill,The stuff they wear beneath the armour
13-09-2019T14:01:11,CrimsonQuill,Like the people in SPartan Ops
13-09-2019T14:01:13,AnuSekaniArt,Hello all ^^
13-09-2019T14:01:23,AnuSekaniArt,Doing a few things so will mostly be in lurker mode I think
13-09-2019T14:01:30,CrimsonQuill,Is there a Sage stream tonight or somethong?
13-09-2019T14:01:35,TeapotOfDoom,Yas
13-09-2019T14:01:46,CrimsonQuill,Ah ok
13-09-2019T14:01:52,CrimsonQuill,Is the new comic page coming tonight?
13-09-2019T14:02:13,TeapotOfDoom,Forgot that that's on saturdays and stumbled in here by coincidence
13-09-2019T14:02:32,TeapotOfDoom,No regrets tho ^^
13-09-2019T14:02:37,SageSaga,i always stream at this time on Saturday
13-09-2019T14:02:47,CrRAR,tis true
13-09-2019T14:02:50,TeapotOfDoom,I know i still forgot
13-09-2019T14:02:54,CrimsonQuill,I'm just venting my worries at whoever'll listen like an attention seeker.
13-09-2019T14:03:12,CrimsonQuill,Copyright angst and that sorta thing.
13-09-2019T14:03:22,TeapotOfDoom,Cause halo?
13-09-2019T14:03:26,CrimsonQuill,Yah.
13-09-2019T14:03:42,CrimsonQuill,And waiting for 'Approval of God (Tom)'
13-09-2019T14:03:47,CrimsonQuill,Because I'm indecisive
13-09-2019T14:03:58,TeapotOfDoom,I don't think anyone will care as long as you don't monetize
13-09-2019T14:04:11,CrimsonQuill,That is my problem...
13-09-2019T14:04:17,CrimsonQuill,"A part of me says, just go ahead..."
13-09-2019T14:04:28,CrimsonQuill,But a huge part of me says 'ask permission first'.
13-09-2019T14:05:01,CrimsonQuill,So I'm stuck
13-09-2019T14:05:36,CrimsonQuill,"I've already sent the email asking...and now I feel that if I went ahead anyway, I'd basically be going back on things."
13-09-2019T14:05:44,CrimsonQuill,A sort of false front.
13-09-2019T14:05:45,TeapotOfDoom,As you're using one of toms characters it's prolly a good idea to ask. But I'd still use it as practice until you've got permission
13-09-2019T14:05:54,CrimsonQuill,Yeah...
13-09-2019T14:06:05,CrimsonQuill,I am pretty proud as to how the pic turned out.
13-09-2019T14:06:20,CrimsonQuill,I still have trouble drawing the face straight on (the eyes) but I'm getting there.
13-09-2019T14:06:25,CrimsonQuill,And her hair is ok.
13-09-2019T14:06:34,CrimsonQuill,"The more I practice, the better."
13-09-2019T14:06:42,TeapotOfDoom,"I colored Nibbmaren (as you know), he was fine with it"
13-09-2019T14:06:47,CrimsonQuill,Besides...I do think it's fun.
13-09-2019T14:07:03,CrimsonQuill,It's relaxing to just doodle things I like.
13-09-2019T14:07:10,SageSaga,wait what is going on? What do you need to ask Tom about?
13-09-2019T14:07:13,TeapotOfDoom,Yea
13-09-2019T14:07:46,CrimsonQuill,"@SageSaga Oh, I'm just being angsty because I have asked Tom if I can put Raine in a Halo Fancomic and am waiting for a reply."
13-09-2019T14:08:05,CrimsonQuill,It all started with Halo Raine back in December. Now I have Backstories and characters and Plot.
13-09-2019T14:08:35,CrimsonQuill,So I want permission. Even though a part of me says that as long as I give him credit for his characters it'd be ok.
13-09-2019T14:08:46,SpazztasticKiwi,I have seen a slap worthy endgame joke
13-09-2019T14:08:49,CrimsonQuill,So I'm basically being a bit too fanatic with it.
13-09-2019T14:08:52,SageSaga,"as like a main character or like a background character, and is it something being published?"
13-09-2019T14:08:56,CrimsonQuill,A main character
13-09-2019T14:09:06,CrimsonQuill,A personal project on Deviantart
13-09-2019T14:09:17,CrimsonQuill,Just to post up there
13-09-2019T14:09:21,CrimsonQuill,For funsies
13-09-2019T14:09:48,TeapotOfDoom,Tell me spazz
13-09-2019T14:09:52,CrimsonQuill,And since I've already sent an email asking... I'm afraid that going ahead would be impolite.
13-09-2019T14:10:11,CrimsonQuill,So yeah. I'm making a mountain out of a molehill.
13-09-2019T14:10:28,SpazztasticKiwi,“Endgame took one widow and gave us another”
13-09-2019T14:10:32,TeapotOfDoom,This phrase i will remember
13-09-2019T14:10:46,CrimsonQuill,...That hits me hard...
13-09-2019T14:10:47,TeapotOfDoom,This is indeed slapworthy
13-09-2019T14:10:54,CrimsonQuill,Too soon.
13-09-2019T14:10:57,CrimsonQuill,Too soon.
13-09-2019T14:10:59,AnuSekaniArt,I never saw Endgame so :P
13-09-2019T14:11:06,CrimsonQuill,(I just watched it two nights ago)
13-09-2019T14:11:07,SpazztasticKiwi,they need to sit down in the corner whoever it was
13-09-2019T14:11:14,TeapotOfDoom,Ye
13-09-2019T14:11:15,SpazztasticKiwi,think about what they said
13-09-2019T14:11:17,CrimsonQuill,With a Dunce's hat.
13-09-2019T14:12:14,SpazztasticKiwi,right next to the one that pointed out “Peter’s powers meant he was the only one that could hear Tony’s heart as it stopped”
13-09-2019T14:12:24,SpazztasticKiwi,who
13-09-2019T14:12:26,TeapotOfDoom,It was not that good imo (fite me) the plot had holes and overall it was kinda lame. Just vfx heavy
13-09-2019T14:12:29,SpazztasticKiwi,gave you the right
13-09-2019T14:12:36,CrimsonQuill,I loved it so much.
13-09-2019T14:12:45,CrimsonQuill,Except for how Thor was handled.
13-09-2019T14:12:55,CrimsonQuill,No spoilers to those who haven't watched it
13-09-2019T14:13:00,TeapotOfDoom,Fat thor best thor
13-09-2019T14:13:09,TeapotOfDoom,Noobslayer69
13-09-2019T14:13:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"they took his mom, his dad, his warriors, his best friend and then his brother"
13-09-2019T14:13:19,TeapotOfDoom,Or what was it
13-09-2019T14:13:27,SpazztasticKiwi,for the love of Christ have mercy on Thor
13-09-2019T14:13:58,CrimsonQuill,I hope the new page is posted soon
13-09-2019T14:14:10,TeapotOfDoom,Thor was one of the characters that actually had development
13-09-2019T14:14:15,CrimsonQuill,I want to see what Rose has in mind
13-09-2019T14:14:34,TeapotOfDoom,I don't know if i really wanna know
13-09-2019T14:14:41,SpazztasticKiwi,he most definitely was not the only one
13-09-2019T14:14:47,SpazztasticKiwi,hulk
13-09-2019T14:14:55,TeapotOfDoom,Hulk was weird
13-09-2019T14:14:55,CrimsonQuill,Yeah. That was good.
13-09-2019T14:15:07,TeapotOfDoom,Those were confusing times
13-09-2019T14:15:10,CrimsonQuill,Tony's path was rather...heartbeaking.
13-09-2019T14:15:27,TeapotOfDoom,It was kinda obvious tho
13-09-2019T14:15:32,SpazztasticKiwi,he became more comfortable with a half of them he caused himself that he hated so much he wanted suicide at one point
13-09-2019T14:15:40,AnuSekaniArt,Dawwwwww that's a cute panel Sage <3
13-09-2019T14:15:41,SpazztasticKiwi,that’s a bit of a step up
13-09-2019T14:16:10,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s what near 90 and my cat is laying on my foot
13-09-2019T14:16:27,CrimsonQuill,I can't see anything that's happening on Sage's channel so...yeah.
13-09-2019T14:16:30,TeapotOfDoom,Some of the movie was weird. I may have to rewatch it but i dunno if i liked it or not. Still the plot had some holes
13-09-2019T14:16:37,SpazztasticKiwi,in contrast to the whole bed to lay on
13-09-2019T14:16:49,SageSaga,why not Crim?
13-09-2019T14:16:58,SpazztasticKiwi,I didn’t fully like it either
13-09-2019T14:17:03,CrimsonQuill,I don't know...I don't really mind though
13-09-2019T14:17:15,CrimsonQuill,I'm just here for the talking to be honest.
13-09-2019T14:17:25,CrimsonQuill,"""They're just standing there...and talking."""
13-09-2019T14:17:41,SpazztasticKiwi,"“that’s what adults do, dear”"
13-09-2019T14:17:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"“adults are dull, mom”"
13-09-2019T14:17:51,TeapotOfDoom,The later avengers movies just got weirder and more disconnected because the stakes just got higher and higher
13-09-2019T14:17:54,SpazztasticKiwi,“yes. yes we are”
13-09-2019T14:18:03,AnuSekaniArt,You're missing great art though :P
13-09-2019T14:18:07,AnuSekaniArt,You on mobile?
13-09-2019T14:18:23,CrimsonQuill,"""That's what they were doing last week...that's what they were doing five minutes ago...and five minutes from now, when you ask, 'what are they doing', they'll still be standing there, and still be talking."""
13-09-2019T14:18:29,CrimsonQuill,Computer
13-09-2019T14:18:34,TeapotOfDoom,I have to get on my laptop the stream keeps cutting out on mobile
13-09-2019T14:18:40,CrimsonQuill,Had to put in the RvB Reference
13-09-2019T14:19:08,SpazztasticKiwi,I got work
13-09-2019T14:19:25,SpazztasticKiwi,just  about every time there’s a stream anymore
13-09-2019T14:19:37,CrimsonQuill,"Rough, Spazz."
13-09-2019T14:20:05,CrimsonQuill,Be right back
13-09-2019T14:20:09,CrimsonQuill,Got to scan some stuf
13-09-2019T14:20:12,CrimsonQuill,Stuff
13-09-2019T14:20:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I catch ends of some of Tom’s and lann’s start late for my time zone so that’s bout it
13-09-2019T14:21:06,SpazztasticKiwi,in which case I got the wedding to be on top of so lann’s chart thing may have a delay
13-09-2019T14:23:24,TeapotOfDoom,I know that Tom's on the east cost somewhere. So where's lann?
13-09-2019T14:23:56,SpazztasticKiwi,narnia
13-09-2019T14:24:04,TeapotOfDoom,Lol
13-09-2019T14:24:09,TeapotOfDoom,Well
13-09-2019T14:24:56,SpazztasticKiwi,"from last stream, he started live at 5 for him which pinged as 8 for me so wherever that is"
13-09-2019T14:24:58,SageSaga,Vegas
13-09-2019T14:25:02,SageSaga,Lann is in Vegas
13-09-2019T14:25:21,TeapotOfDoom,One of these days i will design a proper wifi for my home
13-09-2019T14:26:55,TeapotOfDoom,Vegas is one of those cities that sound nice but are prolly kind of annoying to actually live in or am i completely off?
13-09-2019T14:26:58,Bigboi182,hey guys!
13-09-2019T14:27:10,TeapotOfDoom,Hi ma Boii
13-09-2019T14:27:37,AnuSekaniArt,Freshman year roommate was from Vegas
13-09-2019T14:27:50,AnuSekaniArt,He's not the biggest fan lol
13-09-2019T14:28:13,SageSaga,it's a big place- there are good parts and bad as with most places
13-09-2019T14:30:17,TeapotOfDoom,And finally on ma laptop
13-09-2019T14:30:35,TeapotOfDoom,the stream cutting out every 5 seconds got annoying
13-09-2019T14:31:13,Bigboi182,What's been going on in the past few months
13-09-2019T14:31:19,TeapotOfDoom,"still it's like in the middle of the dessert, somewhere near a place literally called death valley. sounds inviting"
13-09-2019T14:36:43,CrimsonQuill,Back
13-09-2019T14:36:46,AnuSekaniArt,"I mean, there are still worse places :P"
13-09-2019T14:36:52,AnuSekaniArt,WB ^^
13-09-2019T14:36:57,CrimsonQuill,Just scanned in my pics
13-09-2019T14:39:07,AnuSekaniArt,"So Sage, do you try and stick with a set panel format or just kind of go with whatever feels natural?"
13-09-2019T14:39:19,AnuSekaniArt,I've always been curious about the planning behind that
13-09-2019T14:40:33,TeapotOfDoom,Someone is commiting hate crimes agains Pepsi
13-09-2019T14:41:24,SageSaga,I make the panels custom for every page based on the actions and scenes taking place in the comic
13-09-2019T14:41:38,TeapotOfDoom,Sry just started to read through Yosh and I thought that was pretty funny xD
13-09-2019T14:42:10,TeapotOfDoom,Also over 2k pages Sage holy shit
13-09-2019T14:42:15,SageSaga,so if theres a lot of back and forth- i usually do a small panel for each character when talking back and forth and include one or two with them in one larger panel
13-09-2019T14:42:27,SageSaga,yeah Yosh is 2260 pages long
13-09-2019T14:42:33,SageSaga,and going
13-09-2019T14:42:51,AnuSekaniArt,That one is on my list X3
13-09-2019T14:43:23,AnuSekaniArt,"But I see, thanks Sage ^^"
13-09-2019T14:44:13,TeapotOfDoom,"I have to say starting 2009, already being at 2k pages and maintaining anotther comic at the same time i tip my fedora to you"
13-09-2019T14:44:29,SageSaga,like this is a decent example of that- talk - talk back - action of starting to leave- reply - follow through and the action
13-09-2019T14:44:57,SageSaga,starting 2009? what?
13-09-2019T14:45:39,TeapotOfDoom,okok sry sry
13-09-2019T14:45:48,TeapotOfDoom,i just read copyright 2009
13-09-2019T14:45:53,SageSaga,where?
13-09-2019T14:46:09,TeapotOfDoom,first page
13-09-2019T14:46:12,TeapotOfDoom,on the bottom
13-09-2019T14:46:52,TeapotOfDoom,"ohh now i saw it imtroduction March 21, 2004"
13-09-2019T14:47:15,SageSaga,Comic started in November of 2003 on a Forum
13-09-2019T14:47:23,SageSaga,got the site up in 2004
13-09-2019T14:47:57,SageSaga,and ive been doing 3 comics a week since with occasional fillers for holidays and conventions
13-09-2019T14:48:06,TeapotOfDoom,yeah that makes way more sense seeing that there are over 2k pages
13-09-2019T14:48:17,SageSaga,Tom started a Month before me
13-09-2019T14:48:22,TeapotOfDoom,otherwise that would have been really hardcore
13-09-2019T14:48:31,TeapotOfDoom,did you know tom when you started?
13-09-2019T14:48:42,TeapotOfDoom,or did you get to know him because of the comic?
13-09-2019T14:49:04,TeapotOfDoom,(also sry for keeping you from drawing xD)
13-09-2019T14:49:07,SageSaga,nope- met him- when i was looking for a place to host comics I found Twokinds
13-09-2019T14:49:39,SageSaga,jumped on his chat room- he helped me figure out how the host worked and i got my site started
13-09-2019T14:50:23,AnuSekaniArt,Oh cool!
13-09-2019T14:51:05,AnuSekaniArt,"You know Sage, you and Tom and many other of the Katbox artists have inspired me. One of my goals is to make my own webcomic ^^"
13-09-2019T14:52:24,SageSaga,well if you have a story you want to tell a Webcomic is one way to do it alone
13-09-2019T14:53:09,TeapotOfDoom,is this stuff hosted on katbox or are those your own servers (sry now i'm curious)
13-09-2019T14:53:24,TeapotOfDoom,also i didn't know google did domain registration
13-09-2019T14:53:29,AnuSekaniArt,Katbox is going through a change now. Sage has his own site.
13-09-2019T14:54:13,AnuSekaniArt,And yeah. I'm an OK writer but a Webcomic combines the visual appeal of art with telling a long story and it's just really appealed to me in a way few other media have ^^
13-09-2019T14:55:27,SageSaga,but yeah the sites are hosted by me now (well Mihari but i do pay for it)
13-09-2019T14:56:00,AnuSekaniArt,Ohhhh I gotcha.
13-09-2019T14:57:41,SpazztasticKiwi,2004
13-09-2019T14:57:44,SpazztasticKiwi,I was
13-09-2019T14:57:46,SpazztasticKiwi,5?
13-09-2019T14:57:57,SpazztasticKiwi,no 7
13-09-2019T14:58:00,AnuSekaniArt,Oh wow Kiwi you're young XD
13-09-2019T14:58:07,AnuSekaniArt,I was...8
13-09-2019T14:58:45,SpazztasticKiwi,actually it depends if it was before or after October whether I was 7 or 8
13-09-2019T14:58:54,AnuSekaniArt,It was November
13-09-2019T14:59:22,TeapotOfDoom,yay spazz
13-09-2019T14:59:43,AnuSekaniArt,So I'm only slightly older than you XD
13-09-2019T14:59:49,TeapotOfDoom,"Cue soundbord ""Aw me too man"
13-09-2019T15:00:00,SpazztasticKiwi,all the artists here are older than me
13-09-2019T15:00:03,TeapotOfDoom,You right!
13-09-2019T15:00:07,SpazztasticKiwi,older than me is nothing new
13-09-2019T15:00:11,SageSaga,. . . Kate is older than you?
13-09-2019T15:00:14,TeapotOfDoom,You right!
13-09-2019T15:00:26,SpazztasticKiwi,depends Sage
13-09-2019T15:00:28,SageSaga,I created Kate 25 years ago...
13-09-2019T15:00:33,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m 23 in 2 weeks
13-09-2019T15:00:41,SpazztasticKiwi,well 2ish weeks
13-09-2019T15:00:44,TeapotOfDoom,you right
13-09-2019T15:00:57,SageSaga,October 25th Kate will be 25 years old
13-09-2019T15:00:57,TeapotOfDoom,Lol picarto blocked the last message xD
13-09-2019T15:01:22,TeapotOfDoom,Wait spazz which day
13-09-2019T15:01:45,SpazztasticKiwi,October day
13-09-2019T15:01:55,TeapotOfDoom,wut
13-09-2019T15:02:28,SpazztasticKiwi,I was supposed to be born the same day as my sister
13-09-2019T15:02:37,SpazztasticKiwi,but I had better plans
13-09-2019T15:02:40,TeapotOfDoom,Lol
13-09-2019T15:03:01,SpazztasticKiwi,then again I was also expected to be a boy
13-09-2019T15:03:04,TeapotOfDoom,But like offset by one or more years
13-09-2019T15:03:13,TeapotOfDoom,wait wut
13-09-2019T15:03:33,SpazztasticKiwi,we’re 5 years apart or 4 years and some change cause the days aren’t exact
13-09-2019T15:04:01,SpazztasticKiwi,David was expected to arrive
13-09-2019T15:04:02,TeapotOfDoom,Also I think it's funny how so many people are born in september and early october
13-09-2019T15:04:06,SpazztasticKiwi,David did not
13-09-2019T15:04:11,SpazztasticKiwi,I did
13-09-2019T15:04:23,TeapotOfDoom,I mean I know the reason why but still xD
13-09-2019T15:04:27,TeapotOfDoom,Lol spazz
13-09-2019T15:04:46,TeapotOfDoom,Who needs him anyway xD
13-09-2019T15:05:31,SpazztasticKiwi,both my parents were happy with expecting a boy since they already had a little girl with my sister
13-09-2019T15:06:30,AnuSekaniArt,Was born in June myself :P
13-09-2019T15:06:38,SpazztasticKiwi,though I suppose yes Kate is older than me technically
13-09-2019T15:06:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Flora is close
13-09-2019T15:07:17,TeapotOfDoom,Flora is 11
13-09-2019T15:07:29,CrimsonQuill,Which for a keidran is half their life...
13-09-2019T15:07:40,SpazztasticKiwi,the comic is 15
13-09-2019T15:08:15,TeapotOfDoom,"we've been tricked, we've been backstabbed and we've been, quite possibly, bamboozled"
13-09-2019T15:08:54,TeapotOfDoom,also did mihari delete all of her tweets?
13-09-2019T15:09:01,SpazztasticKiwi,that technically puts Flora about 15+her starting age of 11/12
13-09-2019T15:09:28,SageSaga,i dont mean Kate in character terms is X years old- i mean I created her 25 years ago so shes been a character for 25 years
13-09-2019T15:09:45,SpazztasticKiwi,2 years is the closest age gap
13-09-2019T15:09:50,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ll take it
13-09-2019T15:10:51,SageSaga,I mean if i was going character terms- Kaylin is like 320 years old but if you go by year of birth shes now technically 700 years old?
13-09-2019T15:11:07,SpazztasticKiwi,well shi
13-09-2019T15:13:10,thestooge2222,Now THAT is cool!
13-09-2019T15:13:57,SageSaga,?
13-09-2019T15:14:09,AnuSekaniArt,The perspective tool?
13-09-2019T15:14:16,TeapotOfDoom,what the hell
13-09-2019T15:14:19,TeapotOfDoom,SPACCE
13-09-2019T15:14:55,TeapotOfDoom,is this used for deformation or just as reference
13-09-2019T15:15:42,thestooge2222,Yeah
13-09-2019T15:15:47,SpazztasticKiwi,that view tho
13-09-2019T15:16:58,TeapotOfDoom,(does someone know miharis twitter handle either she deleted everything off her account or i can't seem to find it)
13-09-2019T15:17:21,SpazztasticKiwi,why’d she do that
13-09-2019T15:18:05,TeapotOfDoom,i think i found it
13-09-2019T15:18:30,TeapotOfDoom,i dunno that's why i knew i was on the wrong page
13-09-2019T15:19:08,TeapotOfDoom,but it was the right profile picture (one of the ones from fluff) and some programmin related video likes so i was not sure
13-09-2019T15:19:35,TeapotOfDoom,but now i got the right page. duckduckgo ranked it like way down
13-09-2019T15:20:07,TeapotOfDoom,"people sure like their mihari, well you know how"
13-09-2019T15:20:27,SageSaga,what handle were you using?
13-09-2019T15:21:03,SageSaga,there's a lot of fake Mihari's
13-09-2019T15:21:11,TeapotOfDoom,Mihari_ was the wrong one
13-09-2019T15:21:23,TeapotOfDoom,MihariCheetah looks like the right one ^^
13-09-2019T15:22:16,TeapotOfDoom,Yep and Twitter which is normally pretty strict didn't block anything when i hit the wrong page
13-09-2019T15:28:12,TeapotOfDoom,.... to be continued
13-09-2019T15:28:49,BadFoMo,(Sage flips the table.)?
13-09-2019T15:29:49,SageSaga,wut?
13-09-2019T15:32:32,BadFoMo,A while ago you were telling a story about how this one anime was keeping it's stories in one episode and then when you started watching it did a 'To Be Continued'.
13-09-2019T15:33:53,SageSaga,"ah yeah- Black Clover was doing like really contained episodes- something started and ended in the same episodes- no cliff hangers- so i started watching it again and was like ""Cool-"" and as soon as i caught up- BAM! Big ol' Cliffhanger"
13-09-2019T15:35:53,SageSaga,"it was ""Begin the fight! - Fight happens- fight ends- Winner!"" for like 5 episodes straight- and then ""Fight begins, fight continues, fight ends! BUT WAIT! OMG! HES GOING TO MURDER HIS OWN BROTHER?! What evil force has taken over him?! TO BE CONTINUED!!!!"
13-09-2019T15:40:10,TeapotOfDoom,OH NO
13-09-2019T15:40:44,TeapotOfDoom,Well cliff hangers are a good tool to keep people engaged
13-09-2019T15:42:27,SageSaga,here is the scene - XD https://twitter.com/beast_reacts/status/1171188562026479617
13-09-2019T15:45:06,BadFoMo,"I would say something about posting links, but I'm too lazy."
13-09-2019T15:47:04,Rosscoe,evenings!
13-09-2019T15:47:40,Rosscoe,what's new everybody?
13-09-2019T15:48:11,SageSaga,yo Rosscoe
13-09-2019T15:49:00,AnuSekaniArt,Hello Ross ^^
13-09-2019T15:49:13,AnuSekaniArt,"Not much, just chilling, watching Sage's stream X3"
13-09-2019T15:50:05,Rosscoe,this is probably the first stream of sages I've watched in like a long time let alone anybody else lately
13-09-2019T15:54:23,Mihari,@TeapotOfDoom Why were you looking for my Twitter?
13-09-2019T15:58:56,AnuSekaniArt,Oh hello Mihari! :D
13-09-2019T15:59:17,CrimsonQuill,Hi Mihari
13-09-2019T16:00:04,TeapotOfDoom,Hey Mihari!
13-09-2019T16:00:08,Rosscoe,"Mihari, she's talkig to you when you least expect it"
13-09-2019T16:00:37,Rosscoe,stalking
13-09-2019T16:00:50,TeapotOfDoom,Lol
13-09-2019T16:01:54,TeapotOfDoom,No particular reason but I was confused because it wasn't the first one to pop up
13-09-2019T16:02:08,TeapotOfDoom,Lotta imposters these days...
13-09-2019T16:02:31,SageSaga,the Lyrics on the songs by this singer are so weird
13-09-2019T16:02:35,SageSaga,i love it XD
13-09-2019T16:03:40,TeapotOfDoom,I thought it was Japanese but it's English after all
13-09-2019T16:04:07,SageSaga,im pretty sure she is Japanese but yes- all her songs appear to be in English XD
13-09-2019T16:05:12,SageSaga,i set one of them to play after this- it has some really weird and interesting lyrics XD
13-09-2019T16:05:36,Rosscoe,well I got to bounce catch yeas later
13-09-2019T16:05:45,TeapotOfDoom,Bye!
13-09-2019T16:06:17,TeapotOfDoom,I have to get into learning Chinese again... I got lazy
13-09-2019T16:06:32,AnuSekaniArt,I got a few languages I'd like to learn myself XD
13-09-2019T16:06:58,TeapotOfDoom,Chinese then Japanese and maybe Dutch some day
13-09-2019T16:07:57,SageSaga,here's the song
13-09-2019T16:08:23,TeapotOfDoom,Ima turn up my vlume
13-09-2019T16:08:26,TeapotOfDoom,volume
13-09-2019T16:09:43,SageSaga,"My Lady has spoken ""Ga1ahad, you will shall never collapse"" So I charged up my lasers"
13-09-2019T16:10:10,TeapotOfDoom,What the hell
13-09-2019T16:10:27,AnuSekaniArt,"I'd like to learn Japanese, Latin, then if I could, Nahuatl and Ancient Egyptian XD"
13-09-2019T16:10:50,TeapotOfDoom,Also @Mihari I'm not much of a webdev myself but my work hosted the Mozilla road show a few weeks back. I managed to get a Mozilla tshirt :D you still using Opera?
13-09-2019T16:11:27,TeapotOfDoom,Ancient Egyptian?
13-09-2019T16:11:42,TeapotOfDoom,I know someone who is able to SPEAK latin
13-09-2019T16:12:48,AnuSekaniArt,"Ye, I'm a big Egypt fan lol"
13-09-2019T16:13:03,AnuSekaniArt,Issue with the language is they never wrote down their vowels
13-09-2019T16:13:18,AnuSekaniArt,So we don't know how it was spoken. We can get approximations though based on Coptic
13-09-2019T16:13:42,AnuSekaniArt,Since Coptic is just Ancient Egyptian spoken but written with Greek letters lol
13-09-2019T16:14:11,TeapotOfDoom,That would be so interesting to find out if someone speaking coptic approximation would be understood
13-09-2019T16:15:38,AnuSekaniArt,Coptic is spoken by maybe a few hundred people today
13-09-2019T16:15:53,AnuSekaniArt,Only really exists as the official liturgical language of the Coptic Church in Egypt
13-09-2019T16:16:36,TeapotOfDoom,the more you know
13-09-2019T16:16:44,TeapotOfDoom,i for sure didn't
13-09-2019T16:17:01,AnuSekaniArt,I've done some digging XD
13-09-2019T16:17:07,TeapotOfDoom,i can tell xD

13-09-2019T16:32:45,AnuSekaniArt,Seconded ^^
13-09-2019T16:32:49,CrimsonQuill,I see what she's doing!

13-09-2019T16:33:07,AnuSekaniArt,I see little bits of improvement with each page from both Tom and Sage ^^
13-09-2019T16:33:38,CrimsonQuill,I have a feeling that this is what's going to give Raine the boost she needs to resist the collar....
13-09-2019T16:33:46,RimaDraws,Agreed their art is eye candy
13-09-2019T16:34:10,AnuSekaniArt,Eye candy and super fun to read ^^
13-09-2019T16:34:28,AnuSekaniArt,Constantly kicking myself for the fact that I didn't discover Tom or Sage when I was younger XD
13-09-2019T16:35:22,CrimsonQuill,I really like how you're bringing things along Tom. It's very cleverly written.
13-09-2019T16:35:24,RimaDraws,I wished I had discovered sooner too. I love their art. And it’s helped me improve a lot more
