05-04-2019T00:16:20,Dadrobit,Reminds me of a buddy I lost in high school. Accidentally killed himself with booze and energy drinks. The cocktail stopped his heart. His dog was trapped in his room with him and got hungry... Was not a happy day in school when we all found out...

05-04-2019T01:02:39,SageSaga,peanuts are  Legumes
05-04-2019T01:02:41,neropan,hand gestures
05-04-2019T01:03:26,SageSaga,"""Peanuts, almonds, pistachios, cashews, horse chestnuts and pine nuts are not nuts"""
05-04-2019T01:03:28,neropan,L-L-Legumes ??!! :ptv-shock:
05-04-2019T01:03:33,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Legumes sounds like a really shitty horror movie
05-04-2019T01:03:48,neropan,legoonies

05-04-2019T01:08:04,NibblyBot,New Comic Page: Raine's Fears http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/1061/
05-04-2019T01:09:39,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Thanks nibbly
05-04-2019T01:10:21,SageSaga,wanna hear an interesting story about Japan that is very random?
05-04-2019T01:11:15,MarvTheHugPharaoh,sure
05-04-2019T01:11:49,SageSaga,ok - so there was this park where they charged admission- it was like 200 yen- about 2 dollars to enter per person
05-04-2019T01:12:56,SageSaga,well they had an older man on duty to take the money from people entering - however- this person was scared by all the foreign people that for nearly 10 years he didnt take any money from any foreigners
05-04-2019T01:13:25,Dadrobit,That's some impressive xenophobia.
05-04-2019T01:13:27,SageSaga,they estimated that he lost the park over a hundred thousand dollars a year because of this
05-04-2019T01:13:32,Dadrobit,Not even wanting to take mone
05-04-2019T01:13:35,Dadrobit,ymoney*
05-04-2019T01:13:40,Dadrobit,fuuuuuck it
05-04-2019T01:14:23,SageSaga,they said he experience paralyzing fear of being unable to understand or explain to people who didnt speak Japanese
05-04-2019T01:17:32,MarvTheHugPharaoh,social phobia x10
05-04-2019T01:18:20,SageSaga,yet he kept that job for over 10 years!
05-04-2019T01:18:22,ZRO4825,"So less xenophobia and more just typical social anxiety but cranked up, lol"
05-04-2019T01:18:59,SageSaga,kinda-
05-04-2019T01:19:16,SageSaga,his fear was the communication breakdown
05-04-2019T01:19:46,SageSaga,he wasnt confidant in his ability to speak english much less any other language - even though he did have training in it
05-04-2019T01:21:06,SageSaga,can you imagine doing that for that long?
05-04-2019T01:21:13,ZRO4825,I need to farm more Nargacuga
05-04-2019T01:21:54,SageSaga,i wanna play MHW again but the arch tempered monsters are just bad for the game
05-04-2019T01:22:05,ZRO4825,Oh? You think so?
05-04-2019T01:22:09,Dadrobit,"Yikes. I mean, I kinda get it? I've had to translate French and Spanish before in my workplace and it is kinda super anxiety inducing, but Jeez, that's something else."
05-04-2019T01:23:03,SageSaga,i think They are just HP boosted Tempered with a few tricks that make them either tick damage or chip damage
05-04-2019T01:23:20,ZRO4825,"I refuse to fight AT Lunastra, lol"
05-04-2019T01:23:29,ZRO4825,I HATE that thing even non-tempered :joy:
05-04-2019T01:23:34,SageSaga,already did her- it was dumb
05-04-2019T01:23:37,Mihari,AT Zora made me cry...
05-04-2019T01:23:45,SageSaga,I didnt try Zora T_T
05-04-2019T01:23:52,Mihari,I failed 6 times
05-04-2019T01:23:53,ZRO4825,"AT Zora was just....longer Zora....and that's pretty much it, lol"
05-04-2019T01:23:55,SageSaga,is it still up?
05-04-2019T01:24:04,ZRO4825,"And yeah, it's easy to fail by time-out, it's so aggravating"
05-04-2019T01:24:16,Mihari,I think it's still up.
05-04-2019T01:24:19,Mihari,With two people it's easy.
05-04-2019T01:24:28,ZRO4825,I think every win I have on that has been with like less than 2 minutes left
05-04-2019T01:24:46,Mihari,I found out finally how to get the forth 4 core to make it possible.
05-04-2019T01:25:04,ZRO4825,That one on its head? That one's a bitch to get to.
05-04-2019T01:25:10,Mihari,Ignore nerg
05-04-2019T01:25:20,Mihari,Just focus on the head.
05-04-2019T01:25:28,SageSaga,i thought they said you cant ignore him in the AT version?
05-04-2019T01:25:31,Mihari,I just cluster bombed it XD
05-04-2019T01:25:37,Mihari,I did :P
05-04-2019T01:25:52,ZRO4825,Does he still eventually go away on his own? I was told he wouldn't on AT o_o
05-04-2019T01:26:06,Mihari,"He won't go away, but it gives you free reign to get the core."
05-04-2019T01:26:20,Mihari,Which is more important for doing end damage
05-04-2019T01:26:21,SageSaga,who else was there- wait did i finish Luna? I know  i did her several times and beat her but i dont know if i had one more-
05-04-2019T01:26:37,Mihari,"It's just been luna, Zora, xeno is next"
05-04-2019T01:26:50,SageSaga,I thought Kulve was next
05-04-2019T01:27:01,Mihari,"Xeno was announced, Kulve hasn't been"
05-04-2019T01:27:19,Mihari,the AC even too
05-04-2019T01:27:22,Mihari,event*
05-04-2019T01:27:38,ZRO4825,"But hey, if you got a beast enough rig with at least 8GB of VRAM, you can use the High Res texture pack now. :P"
05-04-2019T01:27:47,SageSaga,April 18th is Kulve
05-04-2019T01:28:37,SageSaga,Zeno is up now
05-04-2019T01:28:43,SageSaga,Xeno*
05-04-2019T01:28:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Ok now I’m off to bed

05-04-2019T01:31:32,SageSaga,ty
05-04-2019T01:31:42,SageSaga,also - i think the 1070 has 8gbs of ram
05-04-2019T01:32:28,ZRO4825,Yup.
05-04-2019T01:32:57,ZRO4825,My poor little 970 ain't quite there. lol
05-04-2019T01:33:58,MarvTheHugPharaoh,the fact that my 970 didn't explode when playing metro exodus surprises me
05-04-2019T01:35:41,ZRO4825,"970 has been a damned good card for me, to be honest. Runs Beat Saber perfectly. =D"
05-04-2019T01:35:54,Twokinds,Yeah my 970 lasted me a looong time
05-04-2019T01:35:58,MarvTheHugPharaoh,its a little beast
05-04-2019T01:35:59,Twokinds,Very faithfully.
05-04-2019T01:36:01,SageSaga,but Metro Exodus doesnt come out till next year
05-04-2019T01:36:15,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Not if you sell your soul to epic sage
05-04-2019T01:36:30,ZRO4825,Only villains do this.
05-04-2019T01:36:32,Twokinds,"Hey you can't blame me for this one, Sage. It came with the card"
05-04-2019T01:37:01,SageSaga,yeah...
05-04-2019T01:38:05,Dadrobit,":( New cards, I wish. Expendable money is but a fond memory."
05-04-2019T01:38:27,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:cry:
05-04-2019T01:38:37,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I miss playing apex with you father
05-04-2019T01:39:00,Dadrobit,Honestly I'm considering getting back into security again part time. Just not making enough money to feel safe ya know.
05-04-2019T01:39:35,SageSaga,you got out of Security?
05-04-2019T01:39:51,SageSaga,i must have missed that
05-04-2019T01:39:59,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I've been a full time voice actor for like two years now."
05-04-2019T01:40:39,ZRO4825,That sucks to hear it's not going as well as you hoped :c
05-04-2019T01:40:49,Dadrobit,"I have a couple stable gigs that keep me afloat, and I take the odd job on the side here and there for good luck."
05-04-2019T01:41:23,Dadrobit,"But I'm back in school now finishing my degree, and I'm feeling the very tight budget."
05-04-2019T01:47:17,SageSaga,y'all like this Song?
05-04-2019T01:47:17,Dadrobit,"Fuck, I dunno. I can live without it, I have a decent safety net. But a couple 20hrs a week just to pay the rent wouldn't kill me."

05-04-2019T01:49:06,Dadrobit,"Sorry, I've got the stream(s) muted. Currently listening to Crazy Town - Butterfly"
05-04-2019T01:49:17,ZRO4825,Oh that's a good song <3
05-04-2019T01:49:29,Bgrmystr2,"I can see why people would like it, sage, but I think it more matters if you like it."
05-04-2019T01:49:40,ZRO4825,"Okay, song sounds better in headphones than TV speakers, I admit"
05-04-2019T01:49:43,Bgrmystr2,I'm kinda indifferent
05-04-2019T01:50:29,SageSaga,im gonna link his youtube- he does a lot of awesome stuff

05-04-2019T01:54:18,SageSaga,"i cant say for sure but i think hes French? And speaks English, French of course, and Japanese"
05-04-2019T01:55:45,SageSaga,i want some of his newest songs but they dont seem to be on google music yet
05-04-2019T01:59:37,ZRO4825,I ended up clicking a top 10 video games battle themes medley by FamilyJules :joy:
05-04-2019T02:18:23,SageSaga,gah- it auto played
05-04-2019T02:18:40,SageSaga,oh well - i like this song- even if we just heard it 10 minutes ago

05-04-2019T02:20:01,ZRO4825,You need to have Nyna just randomly decide to motorboat Kayline at some point. :P

05-04-2019T14:04:43,CrimsonQuill,I'll be in on the stream tomorrow.
05-04-2019T14:04:43,SageSaga,i was playing a VR game with Mihari- we went from picking up like shards of glass for weapons to picking up quad missile launchers
05-04-2019T14:04:46,CrimsonQuill,Sleep well
05-04-2019T14:04:52,CrimsonQuill,:ptv-greetings::ptv-sleepy:
05-04-2019T14:05:44,SageSaga,and at the end of the game it randomly creates a piece of loot you got in the game IRL
05-04-2019T14:06:10,BadFoMo,Cool.
05-04-2019T14:06:39,SageSaga,"Mihari was like ""What am i going to do with this rocket launcher?"" and i was like ""I got a bear fur vest..."""
05-04-2019T14:10:51,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-KeithNeat:
05-04-2019T14:15:17,ZRO4825,lol

05-04-2019T14:16:39,CommanderTrace,hi sage
05-04-2019T14:16:46,CommanderTrace,:ctwokinds-nibsbounce:
05-04-2019T14:17:30,CommanderTrace,what song is this sage?
05-04-2019T14:18:26,SageSaga,i think Wonderworld
05-04-2019T14:18:36,CommanderTrace,ok thx
05-04-2019T14:19:15,SageSaga,i think i found it- Wonderful Wonder World
05-04-2019T14:19:30,CommanderTrace,thank you :ctwokinds-katdryer:
05-04-2019T14:19:31,SageSaga,i think thats a translation
05-04-2019T14:19:35,sunblaze,hi everyone
05-04-2019T14:19:41,CommanderTrace,hu
05-04-2019T14:19:42,CommanderTrace,i
05-04-2019T14:19:45,CommanderTrace,hi
05-04-2019T14:19:47,SageSaga,yo Sunblaze!
05-04-2019T14:19:49,sunblaze,sorry sage that 9 hours left it does not like the original goal :(
05-04-2019T14:19:55,sunblaze,well alternative plans might work
05-04-2019T14:21:17,SageSaga,np - I actually have a person that's willing to help fund the books being printed outside of the kickstarter if it fails
05-04-2019T14:21:49,SageSaga,"which was a shock tbh but he was like ""I want to help make this happen so if you want to do it even if it fails, i'll help"""
05-04-2019T14:22:03,sunblaze,neat
05-04-2019T14:22:10,sunblaze,kodus to the one that offered that!
05-04-2019T14:23:03,sunblaze,btw mardi-gras demoness looke great! thanks for that
05-04-2019T14:23:05,BadFoMo,That sounds... questionable to me.
05-04-2019T14:23:09,Bgrmystr2,kudos you mean..?
05-04-2019T14:23:23,sunblaze,praise to them bgr
05-04-2019T14:23:50,Bgrmystr2,and I'm guessing they can't help financially to push the kickstarter to the goal it needed
05-04-2019T14:24:25,sunblaze,depends maybe they can use it to reduce taxes of they do it an a charitably way.
05-04-2019T14:24:41,sunblaze,it is possible that using kickstarter denies that
05-04-2019T14:24:52,sunblaze,but thats just a wild guess
05-04-2019T14:25:23,sunblaze,does not matter they offered and thats great!
05-04-2019T14:25:55,SageSaga,so - Cant really talk much about that but - if the kickstarter fails - im still doing the books
05-04-2019T14:26:08,SageSaga,i just wont be printing 500 of them
05-04-2019T14:26:33,sunblaze,are still some left to sell in general?
05-04-2019T14:26:56,sunblaze,or just the amount of supporters that supported?
05-04-2019T14:27:06,SageSaga,oh yeah- see heres the main issue- 500 books cost around 11 dollars each to print plus a ton of shipping
05-04-2019T14:27:27,SageSaga,if i got 250 books - its less overall - but its almost 19 dollars per book
05-04-2019T14:27:36,SageSaga,shipping still applies but its less for less books
05-04-2019T14:27:56,sunblaze,depends I had 35$ shipping included :D
05-04-2019T14:28:15,sunblaze,thean again overseas does that but thats fine
05-04-2019T14:29:48,SageSaga,yeah but Sunblaze- Kickstarter is gonna take a part of that from me
05-04-2019T14:30:19,SageSaga,and because of that I take a loss on every single non-US shipment
05-04-2019T14:30:21,sunblaze,oh? interesting
05-04-2019T14:31:28,sunblaze,does kickstarter takes fees from failed campaigns?
05-04-2019T14:31:35,SageSaga,nope
05-04-2019T14:31:43,sunblaze,well at least thats good
05-04-2019T14:31:45,SageSaga,it's all or nothing
05-04-2019T14:33:13,SageSaga,btw Sunblaze- what did ya want for this month?
05-04-2019T14:33:54,sunblaze,someone in a spring outfit. but I have not decided yet who
05-04-2019T14:34:01,sunblaze,any suggestions who is rearely used?
05-04-2019T14:34:43,SageSaga,hmm
05-04-2019T14:35:16,ZRO4825,the entire male cast :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
05-04-2019T14:35:17,SageSaga,pretty much everyone has forgotten Miyo is a character... XD
05-04-2019T14:35:58,sunblaze,hmm male cast is a good idea for next month I'll keep that in mind ZRO (also I did request axel in decenber I think)
05-04-2019T14:36:19,sunblaze,miyo is a good idea! her in a pretty spring-flower dress!
05-04-2019T14:37:34,ZRO4825,"I actually went somewhat different this month. We don't really see much of Serena, lol"
05-04-2019T14:37:46,ZRO4825,I suspect we're about to see more of her though in-comic :o
05-04-2019T14:39:11,SageSaga,she doesnt have a huge part but yeah- almost everyone will be in this
05-04-2019T14:39:22,SageSaga,it's the Infinity War of Yosh
05-04-2019T14:41:36,SageSaga,originally Axel was not going to be participating- but I came up with the perfect person for him to fight against
05-04-2019T14:41:44,ZRO4825,Nice =D
05-04-2019T14:41:44,sunblaze,wohooo :D
05-04-2019T14:42:38,SageSaga,though i think the Lien fight and the Main fight are what im most excited to work on
05-04-2019T14:43:42,SageSaga,ive been looking forward to the Lien fight for like- 8 years o_o
05-04-2019T14:44:13,sunblaze,oh my infinity war indeed :D
05-04-2019T14:48:01,ZRO4825,Is Phil gonna get to introduce people to his stick? :o
05-04-2019T14:48:39,SageSaga,the staff will be used a lot
05-04-2019T14:48:48,ZRO4825,Huzzah!
05-04-2019T14:48:57,sunblaze,staff of hurtful whacking +5 :D

05-04-2019T14:49:17,ZRO4825,First time I've ever had. 10/10 would not recommend again.
05-04-2019T14:49:32,SageSaga,ive had it many many times
05-04-2019T14:49:49,SageSaga,probably 20 times or more
05-04-2019T14:50:00,ZRO4825,Damn dude
05-04-2019T14:50:38,SUP3RST4R,I cry because Friday 9pm is a 3am in europe and 4pm is a 22:00 pm XD
05-04-2019T14:51:53,SageSaga,it's tough having a time everyone can watch something on worldwide
05-04-2019T14:53:34,sunblaze,it happens I am in eurpoe as well. just get more coffein!

05-04-2019T16:18:55,SageSaga,ive already gone through all the stages- I've accepted it
05-04-2019T16:19:00,Nekonny,abour $1500 left
05-04-2019T16:19:16,Mippy,hi nekonny
05-04-2019T16:20:06,Ordithus,"Even though it's not looking like the kickstarter will be funded, there's lots of people who love your work enough to throw money at you"
05-04-2019T16:20:14,Mippy,It's too bad...I was looking forward to that sketch.
05-04-2019T16:20:23,SageSaga,if it fails - i just get more time to work on it and dont have to draw 50 sketches
05-04-2019T16:20:43,Mippy,Still gonna buy a copy though
05-04-2019T16:21:12,SageSaga,I can still offer sketches I guess XD
05-04-2019T16:21:27,Ordithus,:csagesaga-nynasmirk: one for me!
05-04-2019T16:21:39,Mippy,Yes Yes!
05-04-2019T16:22:14,iliar,You talk so much about this Kickstarter campaign that even I thought about taking part in it.
05-04-2019T16:23:31,sunblaze,why don't you?
05-04-2019T16:23:41,sunblaze,the book will (probably) be great!
05-04-2019T16:23:57,Mippy,International shipping?
05-04-2019T16:25:15,iliar,I did not read AI.
05-04-2019T16:26:42,SageSaga,you could though
05-04-2019T16:27:24,Nekonny,ad a book!!
05-04-2019T16:29:26,Mippy,"Yes, iliar, join us"
05-04-2019T16:30:08,Nekonny,*read it as a book
05-04-2019T16:30:13,SageSaga,Do you like Fantasy? Do you like Dark Elves? Do you like Catgirls? Do you like Video Games?
05-04-2019T16:35:59,Ordithus,:csagesaga-c3:
05-04-2019T16:36:02,Flake,Hiya
05-04-2019T16:37:02,Mippy,"Flake, are ypu aware that you shre your name with a chocolate var from the UK?"
05-04-2019T16:37:27,BadFoMo,Var?
05-04-2019T16:37:39,Mippy,bar
05-04-2019T16:37:44,BadFoMo,Ah.
05-04-2019T16:38:02,iliar,Honestly I'm not big fan of Sage's art style. And English is not my native language. Read AI is not easy for me. I thought maybe if I buy book I finally have motivation to start reading it. But I think this is a very stupid reason to buy.
05-04-2019T16:38:40,SageSaga,:ptv-shock:
05-04-2019T16:39:22,Bgrmystr2,:fire::fire::fire::fire_engine:
05-04-2019T16:46:52,Mippy,Every now and then I remind myseld that Kaylin is actually a dude named Kevin
05-04-2019T16:47:08,Mippy,:ctwokinds-sadtrace2:
05-04-2019T16:47:20,SageSaga,but shes not
05-04-2019T16:47:39,BadFoMo,What?
05-04-2019T16:47:44,sunblaze,she was yes but she is kinda a new indivudual now
05-04-2019T16:47:56,Mippy,XD
05-04-2019T16:48:13,BadFoMo,What happened to Kevin then?
05-04-2019T16:48:21,sunblaze,she has the memories of kevin AND her backstory and can not figure out what is real and why this even happened
05-04-2019T16:48:26,sunblaze,unknown
05-04-2019T16:48:35,Mippy,We don't speak of Kevin
05-04-2019T16:48:39,SageSaga,and shes forgotten a lot about Kevin
05-04-2019T16:48:44,sunblaze,kevin is probably comateuse plugged into his computer still
05-04-2019T16:49:02,sunblaze,at least thats the most likely explanation
05-04-2019T16:49:07,SageSaga,what happened to him will be explained later- im not leaving that mystery unsolved
05-04-2019T16:49:19,BadFoMo,"Ah, good."
05-04-2019T16:49:24,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock: he's DED
05-04-2019T16:50:03,ThunderblitzSketch,heya
05-04-2019T16:50:07,Nekonny,Hows this for the dress colors sage?
05-04-2019T16:50:10,Mippy,Good to know
05-04-2019T16:50:30,SageSaga,is correct
05-04-2019T16:50:33,SageSaga,also is not a dress
05-04-2019T16:50:39,SageSaga,is called a Yukata
05-04-2019T16:51:12,Nekonny,>.>
05-04-2019T16:51:21,Mippy,Yeah...no way that counts as a dress. Long shirst
05-04-2019T16:51:31,Mippy,Shirt at the most
05-04-2019T16:51:50,SageSaga,it's a robe
05-04-2019T16:52:03,Mippy,XD
05-04-2019T16:52:04,SageSaga,and both males and females wear them
05-04-2019T16:52:34,Mippy,"I know, 'm just yanking the chain"
05-04-2019T16:52:46,Nekonny,bathrobe?
05-04-2019T16:53:12,SageSaga,if it was a bathrobe it would be much thinner and longer
05-04-2019T16:54:20,Mippy,Bath roabs are thin? THEN WHAT HAVE I BEEN WEARING? :ctwokinds-clovisgirl_shake:
05-04-2019T16:54:49,BadFoMo,"I would through out crackpot ideas about what happened, but I've come to learn that when someone says ""it will be explained later"", that's sometimes code for ""I'm still working on it"". Plus, giving suggestions 'contaminates' the suspect."
05-04-2019T16:54:58,SageSaga,a lot of bath robes are made of towel cloth- which is thin
05-04-2019T16:55:00,BadFoMo,...And late again.
05-04-2019T16:55:25,SageSaga,Ive told Tom whats happened to Kevin - and Mihari too
05-04-2019T16:55:40,Nekonny,I want to know too \o/
05-04-2019T16:55:45,BadFoMo,Oh.

05-04-2019T17:04:30,BadFoMo,...I'm ok with knowing?
05-04-2019T17:05:43,Ordithus,But is Sage ok with you knowing
05-04-2019T17:06:19,BadFoMo,Probably not.
05-04-2019T17:06:50,Ordithus,"My theory is that he really is dead, and that his mind has a new life in the game - like his conciousness was ""uploaded"""
05-04-2019T17:07:10,RimaDraws,you mean he died of natural causes or...
05-04-2019T17:07:21,Nekonny,I know the TRUTH
05-04-2019T17:07:27,Nekonny,the Kevin Truth

05-04-2019T17:09:35,Bgrmystr2,Did he ded?
05-04-2019T17:09:39,Bgrmystr2,I bet he ded.
05-04-2019T17:09:45,Mippy,Well...we wil all thouw eventually
05-04-2019T17:10:12,Bgrmystr2,oh NO XD

05-04-2019T17:10:37,Mippy,Whhhhaaaa!!! XD
05-04-2019T17:10:43,BadFoMo,"Well, I guess I can through my ideas out now. I think Kevin was just booted out of the game and may come back near the end (with a new avatar [on a cracked/moded server?]) and runs into his old avatar."

05-04-2019T17:11:04,RimaDraws,so how is everyone today?
05-04-2019T17:11:30,Ordithus,I'm good.  Tidied up the house quite a bit
05-04-2019T17:11:40,Mippy,Nauseas
05-04-2019T17:11:46,BadFoMo,...That or he's Nyna.
05-04-2019T17:12:11,Nekonny,brb
05-04-2019T17:12:12,RimaDraws,well he cant be
05-04-2019T17:12:20,RimaDraws,because kevin is kaylin right?
05-04-2019T17:12:34,Ordithus,"Kaylin was Kevin's character, yes"
05-04-2019T17:12:40,Mippy,Naw...Nyna is a woman named Bertha. She is from Switzerland.
05-04-2019T17:12:47,RimaDraws,T_T
05-04-2019T17:12:54,SageSaga,people still have trouble understanding that Kaylin is not Kevin
05-04-2019T17:13:15,RimaDraws,that's what i was insinuating that she is his character.
05-04-2019T17:14:13,Mippy,Kaylin is Kaylin.
05-04-2019T17:14:17,SageSaga,here- this is a blurb written for the comic
05-04-2019T17:14:20,SageSaga,"""""Artificial Incident"" is a fantasy/sci-fi adventure where our hero is merged with their character from a VR MMORPG. Unfortunately for the hero, the character's hundreds of years of memories don't leave much room for his own!"""
05-04-2019T17:14:34,RimaDraws,sage i said i get that she is his character.
05-04-2019T17:14:39,Nekonny,Well conventiona l storytelling makes it seem like he just had a bout of animesia
05-04-2019T17:14:52,RimaDraws,^
05-04-2019T17:15:06,Nekonny,THeres this one episode of Ranma where he hets bnonked on the head too hard and starts acking like a girl
05-04-2019T17:15:23,Nekonny,and there's that trope of switched personalities
05-04-2019T17:16:02,SageSaga,http://sage.katbox.net/comics/ai/fallen-star-24/
05-04-2019T17:16:04,Nekonny,brb water break

05-04-2019T17:21:07,SageSaga,"The whole point of the end of Chapter 4 was to setup Mike and the universe spanning, and also explain how Kaylin isn't just Kevin controlling Kaylin"
05-04-2019T17:21:22,Ordithus,Sometimes a review is needed http://sage.katbox.net/comics/ai/prologue-26/

05-04-2019T17:36:58,sunblaze,I still do not get why
05-04-2019T17:37:07,sunblaze,sure the shipping costs are high I get that
05-04-2019T17:37:26,sunblaze,but kickstarter adjsuts your pledge to that.
05-04-2019T17:37:46,SageSaga,yeah and adds that shipping cost into the pledge
05-04-2019T17:38:11,SageSaga,instead of being separate- so they take 10% of that shipping cost for themselves!
05-04-2019T17:38:28,sunblaze,ah ok I did not think of the 10%
05-04-2019T17:38:38,sunblaze,yeah that goes for the shipping as well damn
05-04-2019T17:38:52,Destro35,Hey
05-04-2019T17:39:05,SageSaga,so i should have adjusted international shipping higher but- its already so high!
05-04-2019T17:39:07,sunblaze,I alway wondered why they even offerene dthat now I see why :P

05-04-2019T17:41:39,Nekonny,just have everyone you know do a comission stream to fund the rest
05-04-2019T17:42:05,iliar,"This moment always annoys me. When you buy something in China: Sir, you want buy this $1 thing, of course worldwide delivery will be free. When you buy something in USA: You want buy this 10$ thing? Pay addytional $30 for delivery."
05-04-2019T17:42:39,Twokinds,Yeeeah
05-04-2019T17:42:47,sunblaze,thats because USPS is legal highway robbery
05-04-2019T17:43:07,Twokinds,"Seriously, shipping prices international in the US are crazy."
05-04-2019T17:43:10,Nekonny,not so much for books

05-04-2019T17:43:14,Nekonny,international though...
05-04-2019T17:44:31,Nekonny,I've though about doing a cwebcomic review youtube
05-04-2019T17:44:58,Nekonny,but I don't know if a youtube chanel that focues on the positive things would be popular enough to sustain itself
05-04-2019T17:45:03,RimaDraws,maybe i can share it on my facebook art page sage?
05-04-2019T17:45:06,RimaDraws,it may help

05-04-2019T17:49:46,iliar,"And it even not a book. I mean, it weighs much lighter than a hardcover book."
05-04-2019T17:50:47,Nekonny,Media mail is very inexpensive in the US
05-04-2019T17:51:12,Nekonny,Within the US
05-04-2019T17:52:45,iliar,And my ass in fire when you pay $15-30 for delivery and the package even without tracking.

05-04-2019T18:04:23,iliar,"I wonder why when you wrote my nickname, made L big. I understand why people make the first letter big, although I don’t like it when people do it. But the second..."
05-04-2019T18:04:30,SageSaga,no more Nyna Dakis- I still have 2 Kaylin Dakis
05-04-2019T18:04:35,RimaDraws,oooh

05-04-2019T18:10:57,Nekonny,"Sorry, not sure why I did it"
05-04-2019T18:12:51,Nekonny,I wonder where mihari is... she asked me to be on in the afternoon
05-04-2019T18:15:42,NibblyBot,New Patreon Post: Submit Sketch Suggestions! https://www.patreon.com/posts/submit-sketch-25926527
05-04-2019T18:23:23,Nekonny,I didn't know Picato had bot support
05-04-2019T18:23:57,Bgrmystr2,"..those bots have been around for more than a year though, at least"
05-04-2019T18:24:14,Bgrmystr2,and that was just those
05-04-2019T18:24:16,Rosscoe,Evenings!
05-04-2019T18:24:17,Bgrmystr2,I'm sure there's more
05-04-2019T18:24:37,Bgrmystr2,Iliar made the Nibblybot :u
05-04-2019T18:25:05,Bgrmystr2,"Amenon has the tkpolls bot, it's been around for quite a while"
05-04-2019T18:25:06,Nekonny,wonder how that works
05-04-2019T18:25:20,Bgrmystr2,Picarto has API or somesuch for it.
05-04-2019T18:25:42,Bgrmystr2,it was there when I joined like four years ago
05-04-2019T18:25:44,iliar,https://docs.picarto.tv/api/
05-04-2019T18:26:02,Rosscoe,"Eck, programming"
05-04-2019T18:26:06,Rosscoe,not my strong side @.@
05-04-2019T18:26:34,Bgrmystr2,"I remember reading something about API when I first joined, back in july of 2015, so I know it's been around since then, if not longer"
05-04-2019T18:26:54,iliar,But this documentation is not complete.
05-04-2019T18:27:03,Bgrmystr2,"Dunno what all it was able to do, if much at all back then, but yeah"
05-04-2019T18:28:20,Nekonny,"well, nice job iliar"
05-04-2019T18:29:36,Rosscoe,Anyone get snow?
05-04-2019T18:29:49,Rosscoe,"I had some today, was +-0 so it went away"
05-04-2019T18:30:14,Bgrmystr2,"not here on the gulf coast, nope. much too warm"
05-04-2019T18:30:31,RimaDraws,well anyway i think i will head off for a bit.
05-04-2019T18:30:45,Twokinds,I have my windows open.
05-04-2019T18:30:55,Twokinds,"So no, no snow."
05-04-2019T18:30:56,Rosscoe,Later Rima!
05-04-2019T18:31:04,RimaDraws,sounds like a good idea because i may need to let some fresh air in
05-04-2019T18:31:36,Rosscoe,"I want to go swim in the ocean this year, didnt get too last year"
05-04-2019T18:31:46,RimaDraws,ive never been to the beach
05-04-2019T18:31:57,Rosscoe,I was 6 when I last set foot on one
05-04-2019T18:32:08,Bgrmystr2,"it's about 26C here, or 79ish F"
05-04-2019T18:32:11,Rosscoe,"and I mean the beach by the ocean, not one of those beachs on a lake"
05-04-2019T18:32:26,RimaDraws,its supposedly 80 here bgr
05-04-2019T18:32:27,Bgrmystr2,had a buncha thunderstorms the past few days though
05-04-2019T18:32:42,Rosscoe,right now its +3*C
05-04-2019T18:32:51,Rosscoe,we had a huuuge wind storm the past 2 days
05-04-2019T18:32:55,Rosscoe,then some rain
05-04-2019T18:33:02,Bgrmystr2,ooo that's chilly
05-04-2019T18:33:17,Rosscoe,least it made good to check out a house thats been left alone for 6 years
05-04-2019T18:33:31,Rosscoe,"everythign inside comes with it, the tools, new wood stove, cook stove, tea and table set,"
05-04-2019T18:33:36,Rosscoe,table saw XD
05-04-2019T18:33:52,Rosscoe,"but it needs work, going back this week coming to see how the foundation looks"
05-04-2019T18:34:06,Rosscoe,if foundation is good I'll consider it.
05-04-2019T18:34:26,Rosscoe,if not a sister home just south down the road is also up but comes with 52 -+ acres of land and some barns o.o
05-04-2019T18:34:48,Nekonny,I almost went to the beach today
05-04-2019T18:34:58,Nekonny,"too much trafic though ^_^"""
05-04-2019T18:35:02,Rosscoe,I bet
05-04-2019T18:35:08,Rosscoe,Spring must be breaking out early your way
05-04-2019T18:36:00,iliar,"For example, to work with the chat you have to connect wss://nd2.picarto.tv/socket?token={token} And then you will receive binary messages: The first byte is the message type ID, the second and subsequent message contents."
05-04-2019T18:36:12,iliar,It would seem simple. The documentation has the message format https://docs.picarto.tv/chat/chat.proto But there is one LITTLE problem. The documentation does not have a matching table for message type ID and message format
05-04-2019T18:37:07,Rosscoe,"Whooooa, thats a lovely Nyan"
05-04-2019T18:37:25,Nekonny,thanks %%
05-04-2019T18:37:31,iliar,I had to guess which ID corresponds to which message.
05-04-2019T18:38:27,Rosscoe,Now the sooner I can get out of this rental the better. living conditions are getting worse.
05-04-2019T18:38:40,Rosscoe,"land lady gets loaded, her friends start smoking in the house when shes passed out"
05-04-2019T18:39:17,Rosscoe,"and of course I have no say cause I do not own the place, yet I pay to live here :ptv-laugh:"
05-04-2019T18:40:51,Rosscoe,Well brb
05-04-2019T18:42:20,Nekonny,have to figure out these lip colors
05-04-2019T18:42:33,Nekonny,devianart won't load...

05-04-2019T18:50:55,SageSaga,"Nya like Nyan- then Na like ""Nah"""
05-04-2019T18:51:38,RimaDraws,sounds like the spanish name Nina . just cant do that thing over the n

05-04-2019T18:52:59,Chalodraws,"I like how you drew this one, Neko"
05-04-2019T18:53:05,Chalodraws,very nice style

05-04-2019T18:54:13,Nekonny,what do you think sage
05-04-2019T18:54:19,Nekonny,did I forget anything?
05-04-2019T18:54:23,SageSaga,looks good to me
05-04-2019T18:54:35,RimaDraws,its wonderful
05-04-2019T18:56:09,Nekonny,Thnaks Rima
05-04-2019T18:56:21,Nekonny,now what....
05-04-2019T18:57:11,Rosscoe,Dusk & Dawn boxing it out :3
05-04-2019T18:58:34,Nekonny,she does remind me a bit of dusk now that you mention it
05-04-2019T19:00:55,SageSaga,oh jeez
05-04-2019T19:00:56,SageSaga,wait
05-04-2019T19:01:03,SageSaga,you zoomed out

05-04-2019T19:01:47,Nekonny,what about the arms?
05-04-2019T19:01:50,SageSaga,o_o
05-04-2019T19:02:05,Rosscoe,Shes missing her cat like front arms @.@
05-04-2019T19:02:12,Nekonny,OH
05-04-2019T19:02:17,Nekonny,OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
05-04-2019T19:02:19,RimaDraws,oooh
05-04-2019T19:02:40,Rosscoe,"And since were on that topic, do her lower legs show enough to show off her cat like lower beast legs?"
05-04-2019T19:02:49,Nekonny,why you never mentioned anythign XD
05-04-2019T19:03:11,SageSaga,i hadnt noticed the arms- every time i looked you were close up on the face
05-04-2019T19:03:12,Rosscoe,Well I came in late and didnt see anything from the breast line down
05-04-2019T19:03:22,MarcusJohnson,just change the character canonically to not have fur on her arms :ptv-kippi2:
05-04-2019T19:03:24,SageSaga,and no the legs dont start till under the knees so thats fine
05-04-2019T19:03:25,Rosscoe,Legs look fine
05-04-2019T19:04:05,Rosscoe,VERY fine *smirks*
05-04-2019T19:04:56,Nekonny,Oh well
05-04-2019T19:05:00,SageSaga,the arms are an easy fix though
05-04-2019T19:05:02,Nekonny,I'll fix that later
05-04-2019T19:05:07,SageSaga,if you dont have time for it i can do it
05-04-2019T19:05:14,Nekonny,I have some things I need to do and I was about to quit for the say
05-04-2019T19:05:32,Nekonny,"Well, she had claws and stuff though right?"
05-04-2019T19:05:44,Rosscoe,"The excuse here is ""She used so much fire magic it burnt her lower arm fur off"" :ptv-laugh:"
05-04-2019T19:05:46,Nekonny,I had hoped mihari would have been on by now
05-04-2019T19:05:54,Nekonny,but somethign must have come up
05-04-2019T19:05:57,SageSaga,yeah but the way her hands are you wouldnt see the claws
05-04-2019T19:06:10,Nekonny,would her hands be more feral?
05-04-2019T19:06:15,Nekonny,like felicia?
05-04-2019T19:06:15,Rosscoe,Mihari computing katbox stuff I bet
05-04-2019T19:06:33,Nekonny,or just taking a rest
05-04-2019T19:06:36,SageSaga,no not really- they are a little bigger but her arms in the picture are a little bigger than normal anyways
05-04-2019T19:06:41,Nekonny,isn't toight your game night?

05-04-2019T19:07:43,Nekonny,it is nice
05-04-2019T19:07:44,Nekonny,but
05-04-2019T19:07:48,Nekonny,its a lot of work
05-04-2019T19:07:52,Rosscoe,Its is
