19-09-2019T20:50:09,SomeNiceUser,When you go to a site and your antivirus blocks it: time to do five full scans.
19-09-2019T20:50:41,SomeNiceUser,"Also, hello!"
19-09-2019T20:51:29,HoverdudeXL,Hey snu
19-09-2019T20:51:45,SomeNiceUser,"Hi Hover, how is it going?"
19-09-2019T20:51:53,HoverdudeXL,Good snu
19-09-2019T20:52:11,SomeNiceUser,Thatâ€™s great to hear!
19-09-2019T20:54:14,SomeNiceUser,Iâ€™m thinking about getting a graphics tablet.
19-09-2019T20:54:30,lordfluff,i want one
19-09-2019T20:54:36,SomeNiceUser,Maybe an Xp pen deco 02.
19-09-2019T20:54:43,HoverdudeXL,Nice
19-09-2019T20:55:34,Sclimshady,"I have the deco 2, its a good starter for the price"
19-09-2019T20:56:16,SomeNiceUser,"So, whatâ€™s the strong points with it?"
19-09-2019T20:56:24,HoverdudeXL,Oh
19-09-2019T20:56:54,Sclimshady,"Its cheap, and it does the art"
19-09-2019T20:56:54,SomeNiceUser,"Also, does it have angle support."
19-09-2019T20:57:00,SomeNiceUser,?
19-09-2019T20:57:09,Sclimshady,"No angle support, its like 50 bucks"
19-09-2019T20:58:19,SomeNiceUser,"For me, itâ€™s at the 100$ price point."
19-09-2019T20:59:07,SomeNiceUser,But it gives me a good understanding of what it delivers.
19-09-2019T20:59:45,Sclimshady,"Huh, I got mine new on Ebay.  That might be why"
19-09-2019T21:00:10,SomeNiceUser,Iâ€™m getting it from amazon.
19-09-2019T21:00:26,SomeNiceUser,Free shipping.
19-09-2019T21:01:11,HoverdudeXL,Who plays volleyball
19-09-2019T21:01:25,SomeNiceUser,"Judging from the long amount of time, itâ€™s probably coming from the US."
19-09-2019T21:01:33,AspiringNoodle,"If my tablet ever breaks, I'm probably going to get the cheapest one I can that has a screen"
19-09-2019T21:01:53,AspiringNoodle,"I like my intuos, but the lack of a screen is harder to adapt to than I thought"
19-09-2019T21:02:21,Sclimshady,"Oh,  yeah,  Intl' shipping might be a factor in the price.  Free shipping quoted or not"
19-09-2019T21:02:21,SomeNiceUser,"If the one Iâ€™m getting breaks, Iâ€™m gonna use it as a cutting board."
19-09-2019T21:02:30,SomeNiceUser,lol
19-09-2019T21:04:05,HoverdudeXL,Lol
19-09-2019T21:04:09,SomeNiceUser,The screenless tablets look like cutting boards.
19-09-2019T21:05:03,SomeNiceUser,"But Iâ€™m sure gonna take care of it, since itâ€™s fairly expensive."
19-09-2019T21:07:20,SomeNiceUser,"I got bored, so I did a few things with Blender."
19-09-2019T21:08:05,SomeNiceUser,Itâ€™s a lot of fun to experiment with.
19-09-2019T21:17:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"Mark: hey mom, are we in Korea?"
19-09-2019T21:17:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Momiplier: no weâ€™re in North Korea
19-09-2019T21:20:03,AspiringNoodle,"RIP, lol"

19-09-2019T21:27:51,SomeNiceUser,What site can I use if I want to start a webcomic?
19-09-2019T21:32:37,SomeNiceUser,Because Iâ€™m not sure on what site is best for me.
19-09-2019T23:02:25,AspiringNoodle,I think I'm done with overwatch for a bit :ptv-unimpressed:
