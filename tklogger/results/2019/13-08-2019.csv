13-08-2019T00:01:10,Mikemkke034,How're you today?
13-08-2019T00:01:34,AspiringNoodle,"sore, lol"
13-08-2019T00:01:49,Mikemkke034,Oof.
13-08-2019T00:02:16,AspiringNoodle,"And I'm just thinking, ""I have to work for at least the next 5 days straight"""
13-08-2019T00:02:30,AspiringNoodle,but now there's potentially another job offer on the table?
13-08-2019T00:02:37,AspiringNoodle,And the call might be tomorrow to discuss it further?
13-08-2019T00:02:40,Mikemkke034,Is the other offer better?
13-08-2019T00:02:49,AspiringNoodle,"Up front, yes."
13-08-2019T00:02:56,Mikemkke034,Long term?
13-08-2019T00:02:59,AspiringNoodle,"Current job, starting wage of $9.50 an hour"
13-08-2019T00:03:04,AspiringNoodle,"Other job, $20"
13-08-2019T00:03:09,Mikemkke034,Wow
13-08-2019T00:03:29,AspiringNoodle,"Well, it would likely have me use my degree (though tbh I wouldn't feel comfortable until i did a deep dive back into code)"
13-08-2019T00:04:13,Mikemkke034,So positive or negative for long term?
13-08-2019T00:04:18,AspiringNoodle,Probably positive
13-08-2019T00:04:40,AspiringNoodle,My current job is 32 hours a week max at 4 - 5 days a week
13-08-2019T00:04:50,Mikemkke034,And the new offer
13-08-2019T00:04:56,AspiringNoodle,Don't know yet
13-08-2019T00:05:05,Mikemkke034,Hmm
13-08-2019T00:05:16,Mikemkke034,What exactly is you current job?
13-08-2019T00:05:22,AspiringNoodle,Cashier at a gas station :3
13-08-2019T00:05:37,Mikemkke034,"Oh yeah, forgot 'bout that :thinking:"
13-08-2019T00:05:40,AspiringNoodle,I work anywhere from 3 - 11 (though it may be 2 - 10 soon if the new manager reverts their changes)
13-08-2019T00:06:02,Mikemkke034,But I'm guessing those are decent hours?
13-08-2019T00:06:14,AspiringNoodle,"eh, they're late hours, lol"
13-08-2019T00:06:47,Mikemkke034,I'm with you on the late hours. With school starting tomorrow (this morning) I had to shift to closing shift at work
13-08-2019T00:07:01,Mikemkke034,So now anywhere from 4-10/11
13-08-2019T00:07:06,AspiringNoodle,I plan to go to bed in ~20 minutes
13-08-2019T00:07:16,Mikemkke034,Idk when I plan to
13-08-2019T00:07:28,Mikemkke034,I have mixed feelings about sleep
13-08-2019T00:07:36,AspiringNoodle,"And my thoughts are definitely that of ""It feels better to get work out of the way at the start of the day, than it be one of the last things"""
13-08-2019T00:07:55,Mikemkke034,So you'd rather open
13-08-2019T00:08:06,AspiringNoodle,"Although, that may be the whole I'm working an hour later than I was told :P"
13-08-2019T00:08:21,Mikemkke034,Lol
13-08-2019T00:08:25,AspiringNoodle,I'm a weird one
13-08-2019T00:08:36,Mikemkke034,nods in agreement
13-08-2019T00:08:37,AspiringNoodle,"I prefer to get things done at the start of the day, but I also like to stay up late"
13-08-2019T00:09:02,AspiringNoodle,"And it's not like I'm ""energetic"" at night.  It's just that I like staying up late and will tend to work later."
13-08-2019T00:09:22,Mikemkke034,I'm about the same
13-08-2019T00:09:31,Mikemkke034,Might just be the time of year and all
13-08-2019T00:10:13,AspiringNoodle,I'm torn between wanting to wake up at a reasonable time and staying up late enough to catch late night programming / tom's streams
13-08-2019T00:10:32,AspiringNoodle,"For most of college, i went to bed at 1 because that's when my guild stopped raiding in WoW :P"
13-08-2019T00:10:54,Mikemkke034,Lol
13-08-2019T00:11:15,AspiringNoodle,"So I'm asking myself questions like, ""Do I want to go to bed at 1 or 2?"" ""Or do I want to wake up at 8 or earlier more?"""
13-08-2019T00:11:38,Mikemkke034,"Tbh, as long as you have a day or two that you sleep a reasonable amount per week, you can go to bed late, and wake up early"
13-08-2019T00:11:52,AspiringNoodle,I'm also open to naps :3
13-08-2019T00:11:56,Mikemkke034,That too
13-08-2019T00:12:01,Mikemkke034,Napping is great
13-08-2019T00:12:03,AspiringNoodle,But.... that only really works with predictable work schedules ^^;
13-08-2019T00:12:25,Mikemkke034,"Or when you have your schedule beforehand and plan your ""rest days"""
13-08-2019T00:12:45,Mikemkke034,üòã
13-08-2019T00:12:45,AspiringNoodle,"Tbh, retail can blow me, lol"
13-08-2019T00:12:50,Mikemkke034,Lol
13-08-2019T00:12:55,AspiringNoodle,"The whole ""flexible schedule"" thing doesn't fly with me"
13-08-2019T00:13:10,AspiringNoodle,"I work better with structure, rigidity, and predictability :)"
13-08-2019T00:13:24,Mikemkke034,Fair enough
13-08-2019T00:13:42,Mikemkke034,I have bizzaire hours sometimes
13-08-2019T00:13:42,AspiringNoodle,"That might also be why I've been having anxiety around deciding what to do, lol"
13-08-2019T00:14:08,Mikemkke034,Hmmm :thinking:
13-08-2019T00:15:15,Mikemkke034,You could try asking for a slightly more structured schedule at work
13-08-2019T00:15:47,Mikemkke034,"Maybe not ""~ to ~"" everyday, but something predictable"
13-08-2019T00:16:17,AspiringNoodle,Let's see how this other offer plays out
13-08-2019T00:16:40,Mikemkke034,Yeah. I guess the only thing I can ask is to keep me updated
13-08-2019T00:16:49,Mikemkke034,Lol
13-08-2019T00:17:08,AspiringNoodle,"Man, ever since I found out about the gaming industry's bs, my life has kinda turned upside down :/"
13-08-2019T00:17:28,Mikemkke034,Cause of people like Activision?
13-08-2019T00:17:37,AspiringNoodle,"Well, just the industry in general"
13-08-2019T00:17:55,Mikemkke034,I was giving an example üòã üòÇ
13-08-2019T00:18:13,AspiringNoodle,"Developers like Bungie, Respawn, and CD Projekt Red are exceptions rather than the rule"
13-08-2019T00:18:40,Mikemkke034,Ye
13-08-2019T00:18:48,AspiringNoodle,"They put out decent games, AND they want to prioritize work life balance"
13-08-2019T00:19:17,AspiringNoodle,"Rather than the standard ""Monetize this game to hell, aaaaaaaaand you gotta meet this deadline, so I don't give two shits if you have to work 80 hours a week for the next two months."""
13-08-2019T00:19:20,AspiringNoodle,"""Have fun with that!"""
13-08-2019T00:19:57,AspiringNoodle,Want to learn a dirty little secret about Fortnite's success?
13-08-2019T00:20:04,Mikemkke034,Go for it
13-08-2019T00:20:09,Mikemkke034,My guess before you start
13-08-2019T00:20:41,Mikemkke034,Overworked game Devs and possibly low pay (for the amount of work done)
13-08-2019T00:20:54,AspiringNoodle,"Close, lol"
13-08-2019T00:20:56,AspiringNoodle,The developers have to work so much overtime that their bonuses end up being worth triple their salary :)
13-08-2019T00:22:06,AspiringNoodle,"The compensation is great, but the problem is that working developers that hard WILL burn them out, no matter how much you compensate them"
13-08-2019T00:22:32,Mikemkke034,Ah
13-08-2019T00:22:38,Mikemkke034,So almost correct
13-08-2019T00:22:56,AspiringNoodle,The last stat I saw is that the average career span in game development is STILL 5 years
13-08-2019T00:23:22,Mikemkke034,Damn
13-08-2019T00:23:44,Mikemkke034,Is that what your degree is in?
13-08-2019T00:23:54,AspiringNoodle,"Nope, computer science"
13-08-2019T00:24:00,AspiringNoodle,It's a pretty general purpose programming degree
13-08-2019T00:24:08,Mikemkke034,"Ah, so where I'm wanting to go with my life"
13-08-2019T00:24:19,AspiringNoodle,"Not really specialized in anything, but you know a lot of concepts that let you learn anything"
13-08-2019T00:24:27,Mikemkke034,Yeah
13-08-2019T00:24:39,AspiringNoodle,"Straight up, game developer degrees are WORTHLESS"
13-08-2019T00:24:47,AspiringNoodle,"Yes, they are very specific to the industry, but that's it"
13-08-2019T00:25:02,AspiringNoodle,"If you don't work in game development for the rest of your life, the degree means nothing"
13-08-2019T00:25:10,Mikemkke034,Fair enough
13-08-2019T00:25:25,Mikemkke034,"Whereas the CS degree can be ""morphed"" in a sense"
13-08-2019T00:25:32,AspiringNoodle,Concepts I learned for my degree
13-08-2019T00:26:43,AspiringNoodle,"Standard loops / flags. linked lists, AI, operating systems, computer graphics (my concentration), OOP, algorithmic efficiency / design"
13-08-2019T00:27:00,Mikemkke034,Ah
13-08-2019T00:27:23,AspiringNoodle,Shame I got my degree when I did
13-08-2019T00:27:33,Mikemkke034,Elaborate?
13-08-2019T00:27:35,AspiringNoodle,My university was JUST starting to put in game development courses
13-08-2019T00:27:46,AspiringNoodle,Could've fleshed out my degree with some of those :c
13-08-2019T00:27:51,Mikemkke034,Oh
13-08-2019T00:28:07,Mikemkke034,If only you'd waited a year ü§îüòÅ
13-08-2019T00:28:24,Mikemkke034,"Anyways, I'm off to sleep. Gotta be up early in the morn"

13-08-2019T00:29:37,Mikemkke034,"I think I'm 4-10 tomorrow, then off Thurs"
13-08-2019T00:29:44,Mikemkke034,"So lucky me, right?"
13-08-2019T00:29:50,AspiringNoodle,I don't think I'm off until tuesday
