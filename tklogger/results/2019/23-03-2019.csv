23-03-2019T12:30:53,RimaDraws,how is everyone
23-03-2019T12:33:20,Mippy,good
23-03-2019T12:34:48,BadFoMo,I'm fine. you?
23-03-2019T12:34:53,BadFoMo,*You?
23-03-2019T12:35:32,iliar,Tom. Did you read Sequential Art https://www.collectedcurios.com/sequentialart.php
23-03-2019T12:35:54,iliar,"And your forgot ""What? I’m just being realistic."" in page transcript"
23-03-2019T12:37:50,Twokinds,I know of Sequential Art. I haven't read it.
23-03-2019T12:38:29,RimaDraws,i might give it a read
23-03-2019T12:43:19,iliar,"I wanted to offer ""Nibs meet Scarlet"" or something like this. I think this two squirrels have fun together. https://www.collectedcurios.com/sequentialart.php?s=75"
23-03-2019T12:43:46,iliar,"But if you have not read it, perhaps this is not a good idea."
23-03-2019T12:46:54,Twokinds,I think it's fine
23-03-2019T12:52:10,iliar,"If you think so ... I think next time. Since you have not read it is probably better to add a few comments about the character of Scarlet, so that you understand better who it is. https://www.collectedcurios.com/sequentialart.php?s=47"
23-03-2019T13:00:30,iliar,And about gallery site. I plan add separate section with fanarts. Like on your site http://twokinds.keenspot.com/fanart/
23-03-2019T13:00:38,iliar,And I already started adding art to the database http://twokinds.gallery/fanarts.jsp
23-03-2019T13:00:42,iliar,What you think about this?
23-03-2019T13:01:58,Twokinds,Sure
23-03-2019T13:02:50,Twokinds,As long as it is not nsfw content or links to nsfw content.
23-03-2019T13:04:19,BadFoMo,...Should the FanArt be split into SFW and NSFW pages?
23-03-2019T13:04:41,iliar,I try not to add to the database NSFW content or arts with extreme fetishes.
23-03-2019T13:05:28,iliar,"You know, dirty diapers, extremely pregnant and stuff like this."
23-03-2019T13:06:38,BadFoMo,Oh! What about a section for FanFics?
23-03-2019T13:07:42,BadFoMo,Sorry to (maybe?) give you more work.
23-03-2019T13:08:08,RimaDraws,i wonder
23-03-2019T13:08:25,RimaDraws,wait who can submit fanart
23-03-2019T13:08:26,BadFoMo,About...?
23-03-2019T13:08:38,BadFoMo,Oh.
23-03-2019T13:08:59,RimaDraws,nah nevermind ill keep it on DA
23-03-2019T13:09:41,RimaDraws,i am still thinking about my next TK fanart. might be red and raine
23-03-2019T13:09:47,iliar,But some things are very difficult to catalog. The border between SFW and NSFW is very blurred. So sometimes I can be wrong.
23-03-2019T13:10:19,Ordithus,"If it goes beyond what Tom draws, it's probably NSFW :ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:"
23-03-2019T13:10:31,RimaDraws,^
23-03-2019T13:10:43,Twokinds,Yeah duh
23-03-2019T13:10:47,Twokinds,Jesus
23-03-2019T13:10:54,RimaDraws,i mean really.
23-03-2019T13:11:39,Mippy,loltastic
23-03-2019T13:12:22,CommanderTrace,Hello Tom :ptv-greetings::ctwokinds-nibsbounce:
23-03-2019T13:13:23,iliar,RimaDraws: I plan to add links to other resources to the database. Not only FA. I just decided to start with arts from FA
23-03-2019T13:14:17,CommanderTrace,Hello Sage :ptv-greetings:
23-03-2019T13:14:20,RimaDraws,I mean I wasn’t saying ...
23-03-2019T13:14:56,RimaDraws,I had only wondered because I only had one fanart I deemed worthy to submit
23-03-2019T13:15:24,Mippy,Hmmmm....I should do some fanart for fanart page
23-03-2019T13:15:41,RimaDraws,It’s just whatever I mean.
23-03-2019T13:18:37,iliar,"I just yesterday began to build up this base. Obviously, many more things I did not have time to add."
23-03-2019T13:21:42,RimaDraws,Ah yea
23-03-2019T13:25:04,iliar,"About the border. For example, this art. https://www.furaffinity.net/view/24506476/ No nipples and vaginas. And Tom draw how Raine touched Maren's chest . But I still think it's better to mark this as NSFW. Although I am not sure."
23-03-2019T13:26:02,RimaDraws,mhm
23-03-2019T13:26:51,RimaDraws,i know what the line of sfw and nsfw is.
23-03-2019T13:27:43,Ordithus,It's a very blurry line
23-03-2019T13:27:58,RimaDraws,well i still know the line ord
23-03-2019T13:28:08,Ordithus,Some things are obvious
23-03-2019T13:28:38,RimaDraws,yeaaa
23-03-2019T13:31:59,Twokinds,Oh great there's no way to directly link to AI
23-03-2019T13:32:04,Twokinds,At least as far as I can tell
23-03-2019T13:32:09,Twokinds,And Mihari and Sage are still asleep
23-03-2019T13:32:10,RimaDraws,you mean sage's comic?
23-03-2019T13:32:16,RimaDraws,i got a link to the comic?
23-03-2019T13:32:18,RimaDraws,i think
23-03-2019T13:32:18,BadFoMo,Why?
23-03-2019T13:32:27,Twokinds,Because of the borked website
23-03-2019T13:32:31,Twokinds,I can't believe it still isn't fixed
23-03-2019T13:32:33,BadFoMo,Oh.
23-03-2019T13:32:37,RimaDraws,http://sage.katbox.net/comics/ai/blood-claw-bandits-22/
23-03-2019T13:32:40,RimaDraws,this is what i have
23-03-2019T13:32:56,Ordithus,That works but goest to a specific page.
23-03-2019T13:33:02,RimaDraws,yea i know
23-03-2019T13:33:09,Twokinds,Less than idea
23-03-2019T13:33:11,RimaDraws,thats all i have. sorry for helping
23-03-2019T13:33:15,BadFoMo,...Better than nothing?
23-03-2019T13:33:15,Twokinds,If I tweet that it'll be outdated in a week
23-03-2019T13:33:55,Twokinds,ai.katbox.net forwards to sage.katbox.net which is just the general screen for both comics
23-03-2019T13:33:58,Twokinds,I guess whatever
23-03-2019T13:33:59,Twokinds,It works
23-03-2019T13:34:22,Ordithus,Just add instructions to click on the image with the purple haired girl
23-03-2019T13:34:24,Ordithus,Wait
23-03-2019T13:34:31,RimaDraws,its whatever works for you tom. i am not sure thats all i had
23-03-2019T13:34:56,BadFoMo,"So, why did you want the link?"
23-03-2019T13:37:58,RimaDraws,probably to help out sage?
23-03-2019T13:40:04,Mippy,seems legit
23-03-2019T13:51:41,RimaDraws,welp brb. gotta pick up a bite before i have DnD

23-03-2019T14:30:31,Ordithus,I haven't read that one

23-03-2019T14:42:45,CrimsonQuill,Hullo Q
23-03-2019T14:42:59,Mippy,"Good, writing about Billy Budd"
23-03-2019T14:43:35,Scacaan,question: do you think you have to be a furry to draw furrys?
23-03-2019T14:43:51,CrRAR,nawww
23-03-2019T14:43:55,MarvTheHugPharaoh,nah
23-03-2019T14:44:03,CrimsonQuill,?????
23-03-2019T14:44:07,CrimsonQuill,Don't think so
23-03-2019T14:44:09,Ordithus,Is everyone who worked on Zootopia a furry?
23-03-2019T14:44:12,Ordithus,No?
23-03-2019T14:44:18,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"but it can make you a furry if draw then to much, learned from experience"
23-03-2019T14:44:23,CrimsonQuill,"What is it even supposed to mean, that term?"
23-03-2019T14:44:25,SomeDudeNamedQ,Do we have sketches or colors today?
23-03-2019T14:44:30,CrimsonQuill,"I just use ""Anthropomorphic""."
23-03-2019T14:44:32,MarvTheHugPharaoh,sketches
23-03-2019T14:44:33,CrimsonQuill,Much nicer.
23-03-2019T14:44:53,Bgrmystr2,"I'd say generally no, but if it's somethin you do often, or primarily, you might have to accept the yes."
23-03-2019T14:44:55,SomeDudeNamedQ,Yeet
23-03-2019T14:45:00,Scacaan,"i didnt meant it insulting, i was just curious :D"
23-03-2019T14:45:10,CrimsonQuill,"""Furry"" sounds...odd to me."
23-03-2019T14:45:22,Bgrmystr2,"too many ppl see it as too many different things cuz they don't want negative attachments, Scacaan"
23-03-2019T14:45:37,Bgrmystr2,it's mainly just so they don't have to attach it to themselves.
23-03-2019T14:45:41,Bgrmystr2,half of it is just denial
23-03-2019T14:45:41,Scacaan,i dont see the term furry as negative
23-03-2019T14:45:47,Bgrmystr2,some do.
23-03-2019T14:45:54,Scacaan,but not here?
23-03-2019T14:46:00,Scacaan,or do they?
23-03-2019T14:46:09,MarvTheHugPharaoh,we are too loving here
23-03-2019T14:46:13,Scacaan,great
23-03-2019T14:46:13,CrimsonQuill,Mainly because of the less savoury people in the wider thing...
23-03-2019T14:46:19,Bgrmystr2,some people here do as well yes
23-03-2019T14:46:21,CrimsonQuill,But here I think the term's ok
23-03-2019T14:46:23,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-nataniAAAAshake:*[Furries oh no]
23-03-2019T14:46:30,Bgrmystr2,not everyone but a few select
23-03-2019T14:46:43,Dimensional,Funny
23-03-2019T14:46:43,Scacaan,maybe thats why i always found furrys just sympathic and didnt understand the problem of others
23-03-2019T14:46:45,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"As long as everyone is excellent to each other, then love comes your way"
23-03-2019T14:47:04,CrimsonQuill,"And the trouble is, media pays attention to the few bad of any group as opposed to the majority normal or good.,"
23-03-2019T14:47:16,CrimsonQuill,"""Bad"" press sells more."
23-03-2019T14:47:31,CrimsonQuill,"To be honest, I don;t give a fig,"
23-03-2019T14:47:39,Dimensional,Daniel Radcliffe might be a furry.
23-03-2019T14:47:50,CrimsonQuill,"I have a thin line I keep. I like Twokinds, I like HoSalamanstra etc."
23-03-2019T14:47:54,CrimsonQuill,And I think that's fine.
23-03-2019T14:48:27,MarvTheHugPharaoh,there is a Arizona GOP who is a furry
23-03-2019T14:48:33,Mippy,Dose Daniel Radcliffe be furry? :ctwokinds-maddiessparkles:

23-03-2019T14:48:46,Dimensional,About Radcliffe: https://twitter.com/Caudlewag/status/1109707910538559488
23-03-2019T14:49:09,Dimensional,"As for the Arizona GOP, that was because someone drew her as a cat."
23-03-2019T14:49:09,CrimsonQuill,"All I know is he was absolutely brilliant in ""Woman in Black""...and Harry Potter of course."
23-03-2019T14:49:42,Zakuru,wooow

23-03-2019T15:14:39,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Sammy
23-03-2019T15:14:39,Ordithus,Hi Sam
23-03-2019T15:14:41,FloofyCat,"Mippy, you should look at literally any random US military document"
23-03-2019T15:14:43,FloofyCat,Heya
23-03-2019T15:14:51,CrimsonQuill,Hullo Sammy
23-03-2019T15:14:59,FloofyCat,Every US military document makes acronyms for everything under the sun
23-03-2019T15:15:08,Bgrmystr2,"you expect that from everyone who comes to the stream from all sorts of different countries, floofy? k lol"
23-03-2019T15:15:25,Mippy,Why would I do that Floofy? I'm not American.
23-03-2019T15:15:39,Scacaan,"i didnt expect it, i am not dumb, *teeny sounds*"
23-03-2019T15:15:46,FloofyCat,"Neither am I, what?"
23-03-2019T15:15:53,CrimsonQuill,I'm not American either...
23-03-2019T15:16:01,FloofyCat,Neither am I? Why does it matter? O_o
23-03-2019T15:16:07,Mippy,It has no relevance to me
23-03-2019T15:16:11,Bgrmystr2,then why should people be looking at it to understand chat acronyms?
23-03-2019T15:16:19,FloofyCat,You... don't?
23-03-2019T15:16:25,CrRAR,SNAFU and FUBAR... two most excellent acronyms to come out of military slang.
23-03-2019T15:16:26,Bgrmystr2,you literally just said it xD but okay
23-03-2019T15:16:46,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I'm partial to FUBAR myself
23-03-2019T15:17:00,FloofyCat,"No... just said if you think random acronyms are bad, then you can see the king of random acronyms"
23-03-2019T15:17:09,Mippy,SNAFU...isn't that a light novel?
23-03-2019T15:17:42,MarvTheHugPharaoh,FNG is also a good one
23-03-2019T15:17:50,Scacaan,...
23-03-2019T15:18:10,Bgrmystr2,the military doesn't use random acronyms and does not expect people who have no formal education on them to know what they mean
23-03-2019T15:18:17,Bgrmystr2,they all go through training to learn them
23-03-2019T15:18:24,Bgrmystr2,so that's not even a good comparison anyway
23-03-2019T15:18:28,FloofyCat,Dude stop
23-03-2019T15:18:31,Dimensional,Yeah.
23-03-2019T15:18:33,FloofyCat,Stop taking everything seriously
23-03-2019T15:18:45,Bgrmystr2,then stop posting it seriously? :V
23-03-2019T15:18:53,FloofyCat,I'm definitely not posting it seriously
23-03-2019T15:19:00,Mippy,^Can confirm as a former military kid Bgr is right
23-03-2019T15:19:20,FloofyCat,It was joke. Stop taking it seriously
23-03-2019T15:19:22,CrimsonQuill,@Mippy In the army or military family?

23-03-2019T15:52:22,Mippy,Cans can be much cheaper than frozen or fresh. Cans are the only thing some can factor get from food banks

23-03-2019T15:52:46,MrEase,though the sentence did look like that
23-03-2019T15:52:46,FloofyCat,Cans are much more expensive than chucking stuff in a thin plastic wrapper and freezing it.

23-03-2019T17:00:35,Bgrmystr2,LOL

23-03-2019T17:01:08,MysteryEzekude,The Infinity Gauntlet doesn't change anyone's identity. Thanos is Thanos and Flora is Flora. =)

23-03-2019T17:01:28,FloofyCat,What if Thanos uses the infinity gauntlet to turn into Flora

23-03-2019T17:05:39,unsteddyphoenix,You throw it to drowning tourists
23-03-2019T17:05:45,InTheLionsDen,Buoyancy assistant. When you get close to a drowning person you shove it close so they grab it and not the rescuer.
23-03-2019T17:05:45,MysteryEzekude,Running in locomotion with a first-aid kit...The inspiration keeps coming!
23-03-2019T17:05:46,CrimsonHelsing,I'm stupid :P
23-03-2019T17:05:48,Mippy,Literally thought Baywatch was called “Babewatch” when I was a kid. Because guys watched it to watch all the “babes”

23-03-2019T17:13:43,Ordithus,Build a spaceship

23-03-2019T17:16:07,ProsePro7,There's the other beauty...say I just realized that Maren has never been on a bust chart like the other characters has she?

23-03-2019T17:16:35,Ordithus,She has not

23-03-2019T17:18:04,FloofyCat,By*
23-03-2019T17:18:05,Twokinds,Maren's not a very popular character. I think mostly because she hasn't had a lot of character development until recently.
23-03-2019T17:18:12,Twokinds,And also she doesn't have fur. XD
23-03-2019T17:18:14,ProsePro7,More please
23-03-2019T17:18:26,QuinnMalachite,The fur is a big disadvantage
23-03-2019T17:18:34,ProsePro7,She has some now

23-03-2019T17:18:59,unsteddyphoenix,Thats true too Quinn
23-03-2019T17:19:01,Ordithus,I... think it is known I'm a big fan of Maren

23-03-2019T17:19:12,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Maren is my 4th fav from group b
23-03-2019T17:19:14,FloofyCat,Maybe she just doesn't get suggested a lot because everyone just wants to see someone else a little bit more.
23-03-2019T17:19:17,ProsePro7,Next sketch I'm gonna suggest my WWII pin up idea for her

23-03-2019T17:30:28,RimaDraws,^
23-03-2019T17:30:29,unsteddyphoenix,karman and maddie are busy
23-03-2019T17:30:32,SettaFlamowitz,idly ponders Maddie and Raine skateboarding. 2Grinds.
23-03-2019T17:30:45,ProsePro7,Maren and Natani would be interesting...they would need a translator but
23-03-2019T17:30:47,FloofyCat,"Karen, Maren, Kat"
23-03-2019T17:31:02,unsteddyphoenix,I want Kat and Raine to meet and be overly sweet and nice to each other
23-03-2019T17:31:09,FloofyCat,"Oh yeah, that too \o/"
23-03-2019T17:31:15,Ordithus,"I expect they have met, just not on screen"
23-03-2019T17:31:18,RimaDraws,i would like to see kat and raine
23-03-2019T17:31:19,SniperJackal,Im interested in how Red will be when he meets group A
23-03-2019T17:31:22,Ordithus,Since they've both been caring for Zen
23-03-2019T17:31:26,unsteddyphoenix,Until they eventually start getting competitive over politeness
23-03-2019T17:31:28,SniperJackal,except for trace of course
23-03-2019T17:31:28,tehbear,i think Maren and Karen would just ignore each other
23-03-2019T17:31:34,Ordithus,Red has met group A
23-03-2019T17:31:37,tehbear,eh. Maren and Natani i mean
23-03-2019T17:31:45,ProsePro7,Are Trace and Natani even picking up any multi lingual skills or are they just gonna remain in their bubbles
23-03-2019T17:32:15,unsteddyphoenix,"True, honestly we could see a scene later where Kat and Raine have already become friends and are discussing books in the background or w/e"
23-03-2019T17:32:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"The moment Keith drew his sword at red, is the day Keith become one of my top faves"
23-03-2019T17:32:25,ProsePro7,It seems like everyone is bilingual except them
23-03-2019T17:32:25,MuonNeutrino,"@ProsePro7 i'd think it would be very in character for neither of them to learn a thing, mr oblivious and mr headstrong as they are XD"
23-03-2019T17:32:55,unsteddyphoenix,"Just having some characters interacting in the background could be cool, since there isnt nearly enough time to have them all interact"
23-03-2019T17:32:58,RimaDraws,i kinda honestly want euchre and raine to have an interaction
23-03-2019T17:33:12,FloofyCat,"Yeah, something like that. I really wanna see Maren meeting Kat, because I wonder if Maren would call Kat a fleabag."
23-03-2019T17:33:22,ProsePro7,Euchre and Rose was a good one at the mansion
23-03-2019T17:33:30,Aphala,This image is getting spicy
23-03-2019T17:33:32,unsteddyphoenix,:O! No!
23-03-2019T17:33:34,MuonNeutrino,isn't 'fleabag' more red's insult?
23-03-2019T17:33:47,ProsePro7,Maren is just as bad
23-03-2019T17:33:52,RimaDraws,it was good but i want to see what happens when they all three get together and talk. it would be fairly interesting.
23-03-2019T17:33:55,FloofyCat,Seems like a shared one
23-03-2019T17:33:57,ProsePro7,She just changes easier
23-03-2019T17:33:57,MuonNeutrino,"oh for sure, just don't think i've heard her use that particular word"
23-03-2019T17:34:05,MuonNeutrino,"or if so i've forgotten, which is always possible"
23-03-2019T17:34:10,RimaDraws,ive seen her use fleabag i think
23-03-2019T17:34:14,Ordithus,"They're getting better, at least"
23-03-2019T17:34:16,RimaDraws,toward sythe
23-03-2019T17:34:20,FloofyCat,But yeah Maren and Red with the Keidran prejudices meeting Kat would be cool
23-03-2019T17:34:21,Twokinds,lol
23-03-2019T17:34:27,ProsePro7,Yeah right after the escaped the templar
23-03-2019T17:34:28,FloofyCat,And yeah Rima it was in the mistletoe one
23-03-2019T17:34:35,RimaDraws,yeap
23-03-2019T17:34:37,FloofyCat,Maren finds Sythe under mistletoe
23-03-2019T17:34:38,unsteddyphoenix,N-no it wouldnt leave kat alone :(
23-03-2019T17:34:39,MuonNeutrino,ah yeah i remember htat one now
23-03-2019T17:34:45,Twokinds,Yeah Maren and Red share sort of the general sentiment of the average human
23-03-2019T17:34:51,MarvTheHugPharaoh,red x kat when
23-03-2019T17:34:57,unsteddyphoenix,average country bumpkin*
23-03-2019T17:35:01,Twokinds,But Maren probably wouldn't call someone like Kat a fleabag to her face.
23-03-2019T17:35:02,FloofyCat,"Tom, would they be so heartless to be mean to someone as innocent as Kat?"
23-03-2019T17:35:08,FloofyCat,D'awwhh
23-03-2019T17:35:10,FloofyCat,That's nice
23-03-2019T17:35:19,FloofyCat,Nice and wholesome
23-03-2019T17:35:22,unsteddyphoenix,Note he specified only Maren wouldnt...
23-03-2019T17:35:26,Ordithus,She only calls Sythe a fleabag
23-03-2019T17:35:31,Ordithus,b-baka
23-03-2019T17:35:31,Twokinds,Maren calls Sythe fleabag to his face because she's more comfortable doing so.
23-03-2019T17:35:34,MuonNeutrino,@unsteddyphoenix red totally would XD
23-03-2019T17:35:47,unsteddyphoenix,What if Sythe does have fleas though
23-03-2019T17:35:49,MuonNeutrino,"taking refuge in rudeness, eh? heh"
23-03-2019T17:35:59,Twokinds,Red is the type to call any Keidran a fleabag to their face and not see anything wrong with it
23-03-2019T17:36:00,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"also whats sythe got to call her, Pretty, cutie?"
23-03-2019T17:36:03,FloofyCat,Is Maren warming up to Sythe as a person and is keeping the fleabag insults like banter or does she still somewhat despise him?
23-03-2019T17:36:05,Dimensional,And Scythe is slowly starting to like her calling him that.
23-03-2019T17:36:10,unsteddyphoenix,"""Its just racist banter"""
23-03-2019T17:36:16,Dimensional,There's definitely a thing between them. Some tension that Nibbly sees and hates
23-03-2019T17:36:26,SniperJackal,Tom did you actually ever come up with a proper name for red or did you never bother?
23-03-2019T17:36:29,MuonNeutrino,she has to call him fleabag because she doesn't want to be polite out of fear of things developing >.>
23-03-2019T17:36:33,ProsePro7,"Maren x Sythe ""filthy beast"""
23-03-2019T17:36:52,unsteddyphoenix,Maren the type to get meaner the more comfortable she is with you
23-03-2019T17:36:56,FloofyCat,"Jackal, I always wondered if Red was going to be some devil beast thing like the whole fourth-wall Flowey from Undertale because of [Database Error]"
23-03-2019T17:37:04,SniperJackal,lol
23-03-2019T17:37:14,FloofyCat,I always expected Red to actually be some sort of big bad evil guy.
23-03-2019T17:37:25,Ordithus,He's just a dopey dude
23-03-2019T17:37:32,InTheLionsDen,He might still be.
23-03-2019T17:37:38,FloofyCat,"But still though, I'd love to see Maren and Red meeting Kat and see how they preconceptions hold up against someone so sweet."
23-03-2019T17:37:53,SniperJackal,he s like your average bully
23-03-2019T17:38:01,FloofyCat,"Red seems like just a dopey guy, but damn, I'm oddly suspicious."
23-03-2019T17:38:04,Dimensional,"Soon or later Maren will find herself so comfortable with Scythe she'll sooner or later let him curl up at the foot of her bed, only to wake up the following morning with him cuddling next to her, and Nibbly standing at the foot with eyes of red hot fire."
23-03-2019T17:38:13,Bgrmystr2,"lol.. That is one thing I do like about red. Even though he's a dumb sometimes, he's honest."
23-03-2019T17:38:14,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Red, ""Hi Kat, you are every thing I hate in one body.  Nice"""
23-03-2019T17:38:18,Bgrmystr2,and isn't afraid to tell you to your face.
23-03-2019T17:38:27,Bgrmystr2,it's a good trait.
23-03-2019T17:38:33,unsteddyphoenix,"Red dislikes boobs, then"
23-03-2019T17:38:38,unsteddyphoenix,Red X zen confirmd?
23-03-2019T17:38:45,Ordithus,He seems to have gotten a lot more comfortable around Sythe
23-03-2019T17:39:04,Mippy,Oishsi
23-03-2019T17:39:06,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Red x Sythe is still  option
23-03-2019T17:39:11,FloofyCat,"Yeah, Red seems to definitely like boobs as per last page, if anything he'd probably not know how to feel about Kat."
23-03-2019T17:39:20,MarvTheHugPharaoh,wink wink nudg gay
23-03-2019T17:39:26,Twokinds,Red doesn't think of himself as racist.
23-03-2019T17:39:30,FloofyCat,"""She's just another fleabag... but she has... a-and they're so big..."""
23-03-2019T17:39:37,SniperJackal,Every racist ever
23-03-2019T17:39:37,MuonNeutrino,which is ofc the problem
23-03-2019T17:39:39,Bgrmystr2,well Keidran are just animals to hum so
23-03-2019T17:39:42,Bgrmystr2,him*
23-03-2019T17:39:45,thestooge2222,"""and she's got a nice butt"""
23-03-2019T17:39:49,ProsePro7,Red x Sythe....No!  No!  Please God no!  Nooooooooooooooooooo!
23-03-2019T17:39:54,Twokinds,"I mean he certainly is, but he's the type that doesn't even think about things. He just accepts that things are the way they are and why change things if it works fine."
23-03-2019T17:40:25,ProsePro7,As long as you don't hurt anyone who cares if their racist
23-03-2019T17:40:34,Ordithus,He's just not used to having his views challenged
23-03-2019T17:40:36,Bgrmystr2,yeah not questioning why or how stuff works is not a smart way to live life
23-03-2019T17:40:39,Dimensional,At least it's not a dog whistle around Raine's neck
23-03-2019T17:40:41,FloofyCat,The whole general Human and Keidran relations and that racism aspect got me hooked on the comic
23-03-2019T17:40:41,Bgrmystr2,"exactly, ord"
23-03-2019T17:40:49,MuonNeutrino,it seems like he's slowly starting to realize that things '*aren't* working fine
23-03-2019T17:41:08,MuonNeutrino,"which is cool, character growth yay and all that"
23-03-2019T17:41:10,unsteddyphoenix,yeah hard to blame him for the environment he grew up in
23-03-2019T17:41:10,Ordithus,Until recently he probably didn't spend any time around Keidran
23-03-2019T17:41:17,MuonNeutrino,"almost certainly, yeah"
23-03-2019T17:41:37,Mippy,Pepperoni :ctwokinds-keith8D:
23-03-2019T17:41:39,MuonNeutrino,apart from slaves perhaps
23-03-2019T17:41:57,FloofyCat,"It'd be cool to see Red get to know Flora and Kat then, since if he learns of their experiences as slaves he might start questioning his beliefs a little."
23-03-2019T17:41:58,MuonNeutrino,"which is not exactly the same thing, in terms of actual *interactions("
23-03-2019T17:42:02,SniperJackal,"it was nice in chapter 17 I think, when red started to really change a bit"
23-03-2019T17:42:09,RimaDraws,a bit
23-03-2019T17:42:33,MarvTheHugPharaoh,not enough of a bi
23-03-2019T17:42:35,MarvTheHugPharaoh,bit
23-03-2019T17:42:37,unsteddyphoenix,So does Red think keidran are inferior in any way?
23-03-2019T17:42:37,Ordithus,"Heck, Red even accepted the idea of helping out Zen after the Carver fiasco"
23-03-2019T17:42:44,Ordithus,Though he did need some serious prodding
23-03-2019T17:42:44,Bgrmystr2,yeah red changing is fairly impressive considering his history
23-03-2019T17:42:50,Twokinds,The Red Haired Guy is certainly in for some culture shock now that he's in a house full of them.
23-03-2019T17:42:54,MuonNeutrino,"@MarvTheHugPharaoh that's how it starts tho, it wouldn't be realistic for it to change too fast"
23-03-2019T17:42:58,CrRAR,hehe
23-03-2019T17:42:59,Twokinds,He hasn't realized the extent of it yet.
23-03-2019T17:43:02,RimaDraws,he is about to have his mind blown
23-03-2019T17:43:03,tehbear,yeah. Red is outnumbered now
23-03-2019T17:43:08,unsteddyphoenix,"Like ""those keidran are so unsmart, unlike me an human"""

23-03-2019T17:43:15,FloofyCat,"To be honest I've always been curious on what life was like for Flora, Kat and the other slaves. What it's actually like hasn't been touched upon a lot."
23-03-2019T17:43:19,Bgrmystr2,I'm pretty hype to see how red handles it xD
23-03-2019T17:43:24,Ordithus,"That was Raine saying that, stooge"
23-03-2019T17:43:26,RimaDraws,i want to see it too
23-03-2019T17:43:27,Bgrmystr2,or rather.. does not handle it
23-03-2019T17:43:32,ProsePro7,Red and Natani with no filter would be interesting if they were stuck to work together since they cant communicate
23-03-2019T17:43:32,Bgrmystr2,cuz he has no handle on that.
23-03-2019T17:43:35,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Bgr, He screams and runs for the hills"

23-03-2019T17:44:51,CrRAR,off to do a rescuu
23-03-2019T17:45:07,Twokinds,Oooh yeah Red and Natani would not get along
23-03-2019T17:45:22,unsteddyphoenix,Ooooooo
23-03-2019T17:45:26,Ordithus,Natani has got some pretty racist attitudes herself
23-03-2019T17:45:27,Azumachan,Even for a brawl ?
23-03-2019T17:45:31,MuonNeutrino,they would be like alkali metals and water XD

23-03-2019T17:45:45,MuonNeutrino,make lots of explosions <.<

23-03-2019T17:46:03,SniperJackal,who would win in a fight red or natani hmmm
23-03-2019T17:46:05,FloofyCat,"I'd imagine Red vs Natani would be like Armstrong meeting Curtis in FMA, just a flex-off."
