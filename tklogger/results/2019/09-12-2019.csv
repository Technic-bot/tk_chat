09-12-2019T00:00:15,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"And with more wolf bois coming, its gonna be a extra grand time <3"
09-12-2019T00:00:25,CrimsonHelsing,"yeah things won't stay safe forever, obviously they need to leave, but how long they'll be at the estate is another question"
09-12-2019T00:00:33,AspiringNoodle,Don't let Yuki know about the extra woofers
09-12-2019T00:00:40,CrimsonHelsing,I get the feeling it may be a stay of more than a few days
09-12-2019T00:00:40,AspiringNoodle,Or there will be l00d...
09-12-2019T00:00:44,TheSexyBeast,Maybe a nice summer ale...
09-12-2019T00:01:03,ThingsAreMoving,"Are you threatening me, Crimson?"
09-12-2019T00:01:12,CrimsonHelsing,nyet
09-12-2019T00:01:40,ThingsAreMoving,"I will be safe, so help me the smol red button of doom."
09-12-2019T00:01:49,AspiringNoodle,"Hey Ord, out of curiosity, what did you play when you played WoW?"
09-12-2019T00:01:56,MrEase,"Sythe has his arm around Red, this is not a drill"
09-12-2019T00:02:02,CrimsonHelsing,ol' Palpatine references eh Things? xD
09-12-2019T00:02:14,MrEase,I will take anything I can get for my ship
09-12-2019T00:02:17,CrimsonHelsing,someone actually mockingly nicknamed him palpy once
09-12-2019T00:02:17,ThingsAreMoving,"More like Ghandi, but I like your way of thinking"
09-12-2019T00:02:22,Ordithus,"I only played it for a few months in BC.  Shadow priest mostly, but never reached endgame"
09-12-2019T00:02:24,TheFreindlyDeathclaw,He roleplayed as a prancing pony :ctwokinds-floAAA:
09-12-2019T00:02:27,w0lfmare,"Okay, lineart done!"
09-12-2019T00:02:33,Ordithus,"Nice, w0lf!"

09-12-2019T00:02:51,AspiringNoodle,"S'okay Ord, I played starting at the end of vanilla.  Didn't hit endgame until WotLK :P"

09-12-2019T00:03:50,AspiringNoodle,:P
09-12-2019T00:03:53,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Happy Ember is best Ember
09-12-2019T00:03:58,ViscariaSongbird,So Eber is getting an escourt

09-12-2019T00:04:54,ThingsAreMoving,"Saving that emote just in case, Marv"
09-12-2019T00:05:06,MuonNeutrino,uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
09-12-2019T00:05:19,unsteddyphoenix,but why
09-12-2019T00:05:25,MuonNeutrino,i go away for a bit and suddenly WELL THIS ISN'T OMINOUS AT ALL
09-12-2019T00:05:36,CrimsonHelsing,I think that rose window chamber the Guardian is defending has just undergone a lot of disuses and disrepair
09-12-2019T00:05:37,MuonNeutrino,"NO, EVERYTHING IS COMPLETELY FINE HERE"
09-12-2019T00:05:38,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Because you're our princess and we must never forget

09-12-2019T00:07:12,ThingsAreMoving,"nice find, Ord"
09-12-2019T00:07:13,BeeMill,"Oh wow, good catch"
09-12-2019T00:07:20,MuonNeutrino,"yeah, it's the window behind the statue"
09-12-2019T00:07:21,Ordithus,[wuv]*:ctwokinds-statuerawr:
09-12-2019T00:07:34,MuonNeutrino,the one above the door that ominously slammed open when trace released rose's shackles
09-12-2019T00:07:50,AspiringNoodle,Hmmmmm
09-12-2019T00:07:55,Kameloh,always thought this song was cute :eyes:
09-12-2019T00:08:00,AspiringNoodle,Potentially signifying the stability of the estate?
09-12-2019T00:08:06,MuonNeutrino,and had a ~mysterious shadowy eldritch figure~ inside
09-12-2019T00:08:07,BeeMill,Or lackthereof
09-12-2019T00:08:11,AspiringNoodle,^
09-12-2019T00:08:14,Kameloh,lemon is in it :snail:
09-12-2019T00:08:26,AspiringNoodle,That crack is ominous foreshadowing
09-12-2019T00:08:42,MuonNeutrino,and yeah i'm half expecting now that the next page is all the lights suddenly going out in the beach room and the enchantments all turning off
09-12-2019T00:08:51,AspiringNoodle,I need to hurry up and catch up to the current pages.
09-12-2019T00:09:09,AnthroDragon42,It's a literal Rose window
09-12-2019T00:09:17,Ordithus,At least Karen is having fun for now
09-12-2019T00:09:23,CrimsonHelsing,"or like I said, could be just a symptom of the room having not been maintained in a long time. glass does that when left to rot like that"
09-12-2019T00:09:24,Ordithus,She heckin cute here
09-12-2019T00:09:25,MuonNeutrino,enjoy it WHILE YOU CAN
09-12-2019T00:09:25,TheFreindlyDeathclaw,Plot Twist: Only thing behind the door is the worlds cutest Pony
09-12-2019T00:09:30,AspiringNoodle,"But I suspect what Muon does, that by releasing Rose's shackles, the magic powering the mansion is draining fast"
09-12-2019T00:09:31,unsteddyphoenix,oooh nice ord
09-12-2019T00:09:32,BeeMill,Is karen ever not having fun though?
09-12-2019T00:09:36,unsteddyphoenix,connection made
09-12-2019T00:09:53,MuonNeutrino,"@CrimsonHelsing conservation of narrative detail, tom isn't going to draw attention to  it like this if it's not important"
09-12-2019T00:10:04,CrimsonHelsing,agreed
09-12-2019T00:10:37,AspiringNoodle,I have a feeling that the mansion's defenses are about to fail
09-12-2019T00:10:51,Ordithus,"Don't worry, Zen's got this"
09-12-2019T00:10:52,AspiringNoodle,And Clovis (I WANT TO SHOOT HIS FACE :ptv-angry:) will be able to get inside
09-12-2019T00:11:24,AspiringNoodle,Inb4 the next page or 10 is done and all my predictions are hilarious wrong :ptv-hearts:
09-12-2019T00:11:33,ThingsAreMoving,":ctwokinds-redrose: I'm not trapped here with you, It's you who are trapped here with ME!"
09-12-2019T00:11:48,AspiringNoodle,Addams Family reference? :P
09-12-2019T00:11:57,ThingsAreMoving,possibly :ctwokinds-smug:
09-12-2019T00:12:05,BeeMill,I'd like to believe Tom has sketches for the next few pages done or at least planned out for these kinds of things
09-12-2019T00:12:16,TheFreindlyDeathclaw,Watchmen reference right?
09-12-2019T00:12:25,AspiringNoodle,Last stream he stated that the script for the comic is WAAAAAAAAAY far ahead of where we are
09-12-2019T00:12:34,ThingsAreMoving,also possible Deathclaw :ctwokinds-smug:
09-12-2019T00:12:36,BeeMill,I believe it
09-12-2019T00:12:50,AspiringNoodle,"Tbf, that's the smart thing to do"
09-12-2019T00:13:05,AspiringNoodle,Hash out all the dirty business of writing so it's easier to communicate it visually c:
09-12-2019T00:13:06,ThingsAreMoving,"Noodle, Tom was teasing us about it."
09-12-2019T00:13:09,ThingsAreMoving,...probably
09-12-2019T00:13:26,ThingsAreMoving,If he wasn't then Marv is going to be heartbroken.
09-12-2019T00:13:38,AspiringNoodle,I'm beginning to wonder if he's double-bluffing us
09-12-2019T00:13:45,Twokinds,Yeah the next few pages are already in the works too
09-12-2019T00:14:00,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Things, I'm used to being heartbroken"
09-12-2019T00:14:02,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl: most excellent
09-12-2019T00:14:03,Twokinds,This page might hold the record for number of characters
09-12-2019T00:14:11,AspiringNoodle,"Faking us out by pretending to troll / tease, but in reality was stating blunt fact and using our distrust against us :P"
09-12-2019T00:14:20,Ordithus,"Named characters, anyway"
09-12-2019T00:14:31,CrimsonHelsing,it sure comes close to the banner
09-12-2019T00:14:32,Ordithus,The tiger entourage and Evals's family may have had more
09-12-2019T00:14:56,CrimsonHelsing,and that one page that literally had everyone in the Estate dining room. ... or was that in the atrium?
09-12-2019T00:15:00,BeeMill,iirc they weren't as detailed though
09-12-2019T00:15:25,AspiringNoodle,"I swear, that ""currently playing"" thing is brokeno n tom's stream"
09-12-2019T00:15:26,MuonNeutrino,this page probably holds the record for number of *named* characters
09-12-2019T00:15:34,AspiringNoodle,It's said Lensko - Circles for how long now?
09-12-2019T00:15:40,MuonNeutrino,crowd shots of random background extras don't count
09-12-2019T00:15:55,CrimsonHelsing,"I wouldn't pay it any mind personally, Noodle"
09-12-2019T00:16:10,AspiringNoodle,But... I use it to grab music for my playlist :ptv-uneasy:
09-12-2019T00:16:18,Ordithus,They aren't extras to Evals :ptv-whiny:
09-12-2019T00:16:18,CrimsonHelsing,fair enough
09-12-2019T00:16:55,ThingsAreMoving,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't this the most characters we've seen on one page, technically? https://www.deviantart.com/twokinds/art/Twokinds-13th-Anniversary-641984387"
09-12-2019T00:17:25,CrimsonHelsing,yep
09-12-2019T00:17:33,AspiringNoodle,Nibs is too cute in that one <3
09-12-2019T00:17:35,CrimsonHelsing,isn't that set in the atrium? or the dining room? can't tell
09-12-2019T00:17:50,MarvTheHugPharaoh,The top left on that poster is the best part
09-12-2019T00:18:18,BeeMill,When I saw it I assumed it was a shot from the tavern
09-12-2019T00:18:20,TheFreindlyDeathclaw,Sundays are the best day o the week'
09-12-2019T00:18:33,MuonNeutrino,@ThingsAreMoving that's not a *comic* page tho
09-12-2019T00:18:40,ThingsAreMoving,Holy... I just noticed how Sythe and Maren look at each other in that poster.
09-12-2019T00:19:10,MarvTheHugPharaoh,My two fave ships in one piece
09-12-2019T00:19:23,Ordithus,And how Nibs can drink better than Red here
09-12-2019T00:19:32,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-power:
09-12-2019T00:19:36,CrimsonHelsing,anyone have any guess? I'm starting to lean towards dining room
09-12-2019T00:19:51,BeeMill,Hol up. Karen's swimsuit is pink in one frame and green in another
09-12-2019T00:19:52,Ordithus,"What is the other one, Marv"
09-12-2019T00:19:57,ThingsAreMoving,"THere;s a serious lack of dragons in that poster, other than that it's :ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:"
09-12-2019T00:20:12,MuonNeutrino,"@BeeMill it's green, then pink, and then blue in the last one, kinda seems like it's on purpose"
09-12-2019T00:20:19,Ordithus,"Did you not see Nora, Things?"
09-12-2019T00:20:28,ThingsAreMoving,One durgon
09-12-2019T00:20:31,ThingsAreMoving,Need moar
09-12-2019T00:20:34,BeeMill,Odd
09-12-2019T00:20:46,BeeMill,Karen defies reality I guess
09-12-2019T00:20:54,MuonNeutrino,"maybe it's just enchanted, magic's gotta be useful for cosmetic stuff too v0v"
09-12-2019T00:21:59,AnthroDragon42,There's never enough dragons
09-12-2019T00:22:04,AspiringNoodle,"Karen: ""I reject your reality and substitute my own."" :ptv-hearts:"
09-12-2019T00:22:28,AnthroDragon42,definitely isn't biased in any way regarding dragons
09-12-2019T00:22:44,ThingsAreMoving,Your lack of bias is concerning

09-12-2019T02:00:30,AspiringNoodle,"Because they can only win in this scenario.  People holding onto their old copies because they don't like CC aren't giving them money anymore.  So if they lose access and don't pay for CC, nothing changes"

09-12-2019T02:20:35,ThingsAreMoving,streamy doodling? :eyes:
09-12-2019T02:20:37,Kameloh,then invite teddy to draw :snail:
09-12-2019T02:20:49,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I tired inviting him but he keeps noping out
09-12-2019T02:21:25,SpazztasticKiwi,you’re not strapping him to the chair right then
09-12-2019T02:21:28,ThingsAreMoving,everytime I read 'doodling' I picture a tiny dude
09-12-2019T02:21:36,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
09-12-2019T02:21:45,Kameloh,XD
09-12-2019T02:23:12,AspiringNoodle,"Kame, even though you're using SAI, what are your opinions on CSP / Photoshop?"
09-12-2019T02:23:30,Kameloh,they're great if you can figure them out!
09-12-2019T02:23:44,Kameloh,I haven't figured them out :snail:
09-12-2019T02:24:03,Kameloh,if you're just drawing then program like CSP should be enough
09-12-2019T02:24:23,AspiringNoodle,I'm gonna try to replicate Photoshop's default brush in CSP :P
09-12-2019T02:24:39,Kameloh,I never liked photoshop's default brush XD
09-12-2019T02:24:59,AspiringNoodle,I'm impressed by what Tom can do with it :P
09-12-2019T02:25:17,ThingsAreMoving,"what's so special about Photoshop's default brush? In layman terms, preferably."
09-12-2019T02:25:19,Kameloh,well I'd say it's more of a skill thing at this point with all that practice
09-12-2019T02:25:40,AspiringNoodle,I know.  But it's proven to be fairly versatile
09-12-2019T02:26:33,Kameloh,"mm, if you have CSP you could always google to see if anyone has already imported that brush from photoshop"
09-12-2019T02:27:08,AspiringNoodle,I'd also need to translate the photoshop settings to CSP
09-12-2019T02:27:55,Kameloh,I loved the animation for this song

09-12-2019T17:07:34,tehbear,there has been a surprising amount of car accidents here since the snow started falling
09-12-2019T17:08:15,tehbear,"temp is swinging between -4 and +1 c, so the snow melts, and freezes often making for the most dangerous conditions"
09-12-2019T17:11:15,Xexanoth,"eh, still not as bad as public transport whcih every winter get's completely surprised by the fact that it get's cold and snow...."
09-12-2019T17:14:24,tehbear,we got new busses here with floor heating that short circuits cause the designers didnt account for snow
09-12-2019T17:14:50,tehbear,"guess it works ok with rain, but snow piles up and melts in odd spaces"
09-12-2019T17:16:27,tehbear,"but usually its the transport sector that has issues, trucks from countries with relaxed rules on winter tires or drivers/companies that dont care about using winter tyres"
09-12-2019T17:18:16,SpazztasticKiwi,aaaand now it’s snowing
09-12-2019T17:18:28,tehbear,"ive gone of the road a couple of times my self and into a ditch, but somehow ive always lucked out having a farmer with tractor nearby to lift the car out"
09-12-2019T17:19:13,tehbear,i also had a car i managed to save my self by enabling 4x4 + diff lock and having 2 people stand on the wheels with traction
09-12-2019T17:19:39,tehbear,tried to turn around in a tight space and end up with 1 wheel in the air

09-12-2019T17:25:28,tehbear,i notice its often cars with 4x4 that get into accidents on the news
09-12-2019T17:25:46,tehbear,drivers that become overconfident and dont take the conditions in account
