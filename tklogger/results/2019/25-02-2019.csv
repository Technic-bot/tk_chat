25-02-2019T14:55:07,CrimsonQuill,Talking about Desktop backgrounds
25-02-2019T14:55:10,CrimsonQuill,Let me join in

25-02-2019T14:55:30,Twokinds,"It's funny, I never use them."
25-02-2019T14:55:45,Twokinds,My current desktop background is the default windows 10
25-02-2019T14:55:55,CrimsonQuill,I use 'em all the time. I can never keep my background the same for long.
25-02-2019T14:56:03,CrimsonQuill,I have mine on shuffle rotation.
25-02-2019T14:56:13,CrimsonQuill,"Quite a few of them are yours, Tom."
25-02-2019T14:56:37,CrimsonQuill,"At the moment though, I have five daleks made by a fellow Deviantartist named Librarian_Bot..."
25-02-2019T14:56:49,CrimsonQuill,Because Daleks
25-02-2019T15:01:08,CrimsonQuill,Aaaaand now it's turned to HulkBuster VS Hulk.
25-02-2019T15:01:13,CrimsonQuill,Marvellous/
25-02-2019T15:03:52,SpazztasticKiwi,The chocolate bunnies are calling me
25-02-2019T15:04:06,CrimsonQuill,"Then eat them, Spazz."
25-02-2019T15:04:08,CrimsonQuill,"Also, hi"
25-02-2019T15:04:12,CrimsonQuill,How are you
25-02-2019T15:05:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Looking for food
25-02-2019T15:06:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Found a fatality in the Easter aisle
25-02-2019T15:06:06,CrimsonQuill,I see
25-02-2019T15:06:15,CrimsonQuill,I just ate a big bowl of bolognese
25-02-2019T15:06:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Someone crushed a coco bunny head
25-02-2019T15:06:21,CrimsonQuill,Only one helping left.
25-02-2019T15:06:24,CrimsonQuill,Oooh deat

25-02-2019T15:07:53,iliar,Oops
25-02-2019T15:08:02,CrimsonQuill,"I just use pics like ""Cozy"", ""Aerie and Nora"", and of course, ""Halo Raine""."
25-02-2019T15:08:46,iliar,"I wanted say: Actually, I also don‚Äôt care what desktop wallpaper I have. I see it in just a few seconds after booting. But I use the same image on lock screen."
25-02-2019T15:10:14,CrimsonQuill,"Well, I just choose some I like foe desktop and lockscreen and go with 'em."
25-02-2019T15:14:11,Bgrmystr2,"Wish I could use that as a background wallpaper but the people I live with are mostly prudish. Nudity and other such best kept indoors and to themselves, yknow. Not on display outside or to others."
25-02-2019T15:15:33,Twokinds,Understandable
25-02-2019T15:15:56,Bgrmystr2,I absolutely would though.
25-02-2019T15:16:02,CrimsonQuill,"I generally avoid ""lewd"" stuff if I can..."
25-02-2019T15:16:12,Twokinds,"To be fair, if nudity was just accepted, it would spoil my favorite style of humor XD"
25-02-2019T15:16:22,CrimsonQuill,True that!
25-02-2019T15:16:24,Bgrmystr2,ikr xD
25-02-2019T15:17:00,CrimsonQuill,"And then again, couldn't someone call a classical statue or renaissance painting ""lewd"" by that standard?"
25-02-2019T15:17:05,Bgrmystr2,"but then you'd have some other type of humor that wasn't as accepted as nudity is now, and we'd be in the same place, but with somethin else."
25-02-2019T15:17:16,Bgrmystr2,"yeah quill, but it's ""art"""
25-02-2019T15:17:31,CrimsonQuill,"Ah, but what counts as ""art""?"
25-02-2019T15:17:48,CrimsonQuill,The over-analysing Crimson Quill strikes again.
25-02-2019T15:18:22,Bgrmystr2,"I don't know, honestly.. ask the ppl that have issues with stuff like that tom draws.. but then look at the statues and are totally okay with it for some reason."
25-02-2019T15:18:46,Bgrmystr2,¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
25-02-2019T15:19:17,CrimsonQuill,"Yeah, let's face it, the men who commisioned Venus de Milo were looking for eye-cand."
25-02-2019T15:19:23,CrimsonQuill,candy
25-02-2019T15:19:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Nudity and art are defined kinda like how public breastfeeding is defined: some will see the base value and accept it as something to learn from
25-02-2019T15:19:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Others just see titties
25-02-2019T15:19:51,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-ohmy:
25-02-2019T15:19:54,CrimsonQuill,Nice analogy spazz.
25-02-2019T15:20:43,CrimsonQuill,I find faces to be the most interesting though.
25-02-2019T15:20:55,CrimsonQuill,Such as Eric's face as he spits out his hot chocolate...
25-02-2019T15:26:54,SpazztasticKiwi,So I got myself some doughnuts for breakfast
25-02-2019T15:26:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Know what I forgot?
25-02-2019T15:27:28,CrimsonQuill,Grenades
25-02-2019T15:27:37,CrimsonQuill,Donut always has grenades
25-02-2019T15:27:44,CrimsonQuill,He has a really good arm
25-02-2019T15:27:48,CrimsonQuill,So get some of those
25-02-2019T15:41:08,SpazztasticKiwi,A drink
25-02-2019T15:43:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Doughnut and coke for breakfast
25-02-2019T15:43:41,SpazztasticKiwi,What diet?
25-02-2019T15:44:28,CrimsonQuill,Ummm..
25-02-2019T15:44:39,CrimsonQuill,I've been watching too much Red vs Blue.
25-02-2019T15:44:45,CrimsonQuill,Donut is a character there...
25-02-2019T15:45:25,SpazztasticKiwi,And I‚Äôve found a Mark fan. One of the back room workers. We don‚Äôt say hi. We say ‚ÄúMark‚Äù and ‚ÄúSe√°n‚Äù to each other
25-02-2019T15:48:36,CrimsonQuill,Nice.
25-02-2019T15:49:01,CrimsonQuill,I'd like to see a sketch where Mark and Tom bump into Trace and Flora in Korea sometime...
25-02-2019T15:52:49,SpazztasticKiwi,He‚Äôs said Mark‚Äôs not gonna be on the comic
25-02-2019T15:52:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Besides he wouldn‚Äôt fit
25-02-2019T15:53:03,CrimsonQuill,LOL
25-02-2019T15:53:18,CrimsonQuill,"I do wonder, though, what would happen if they met?"
25-02-2019T15:53:27,CrimsonQuill,Mark'd probably make silly jokes
25-02-2019T15:53:43,CrimsonQuill,And Tom'd try to explain everything.
25-02-2019T15:54:03,SpazztasticKiwi,"Mark‚Äôs said he‚Äôs read the first chapter but other than it‚Äôs ok, he‚Äôs not said much on it other than he‚Äôs a bad brother for not being more involved"
25-02-2019T15:54:22,CrimsonQuill,I remember that.
25-02-2019T15:54:32,CrimsonQuill,I was digging through old vids of his.
25-02-2019T15:54:55,CrimsonQuill,I'm re-reading Twokinds for the sixth time now...
25-02-2019T15:55:08,CrimsonQuill,And I've introduced a friend to it.
25-02-2019T15:55:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Dude at work knew Tom existed but not that he had a comic
25-02-2019T15:56:07,CrimsonQuill,My best friend introduced me to it in 2016
25-02-2019T15:56:18,CrimsonQuill,"I took a quick peek, but at the time wasn't ready"
25-02-2019T15:56:47,CrimsonQuill,"I remember it was the strip where Nat saves Kat from a falling timber in the burning Na'Rella, in chapter 18."
25-02-2019T15:56:55,CrimsonQuill,I thought they were in a mine.4
25-02-2019T15:57:07,CrimsonQuill,I tried it again December 2017. Instantly hooked.

25-02-2019T15:59:15,CrimsonQuill,Twokinds was the very first webcomic I read.
25-02-2019T15:59:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Mark did say on stream he‚Äôs about done with SDCC so that‚Äôs out
25-02-2019T15:59:35,CrimsonQuill,"Calvin and Hobbes and Asterix introduced me to comics in general, and the idea of them as an art form."

25-02-2019T15:59:44,Xexanoth,just take care not to read to many of em......it gets pretty easy
25-02-2019T15:59:50,CrimsonQuill,And Twokinds introduced me to Webcomics.
25-02-2019T16:00:04,CrimsonQuill,@Xexanoth I'm already reading too many...
25-02-2019T16:00:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Then again he‚Äôs said he‚Äôs done with traveling this year
25-02-2019T16:00:13,Xexanoth,"and then at one point you realize you have 150 webcomics you're reading at once, and go on a purge"
25-02-2019T16:00:18,CrimsonQuill,HoSalamanstra and Freefall are among my favourites.
25-02-2019T16:00:22,Xexanoth,and then 2 years later you're back up to 150 again....
25-02-2019T16:00:46,Xexanoth,it's a constant cycle of purges and new discovery....
25-02-2019T16:00:56,CrimsonQuill,Isn't life all about that?
25-02-2019T16:01:15,CrimsonQuill,"Just when you think you've dug to rock bottom, someone hands you a pickaxe."
25-02-2019T16:01:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve only had interest here
25-02-2019T16:01:29,CrimsonQuill,And you find even more gold and diamonds within
25-02-2019T16:01:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt go searching and I‚Äôm more on YouTube too

25-02-2019T17:07:51,Xexanoth,also that's a weird teacher if he goes for that
25-02-2019T17:08:15,Xexanoth,"then again, one of the art teachers in my school ocne painted a painting with his own blood so...."
25-02-2019T17:08:33,ThingsAreMoving,that's a bit disturbing

25-02-2019T17:15:31,Mippy,She has products all over. She was part of a show in Korea a few years back.
25-02-2019T17:17:02,ThingsAreMoving,Must be nice to have such passionate and successful teacher.
25-02-2019T17:17:36,ThingsAreMoving,"Most of mine were burned out husks, that were just following the almighty program"
25-02-2019T17:20:59,Mippy,"Yeah, my teachers are pretty solid. All still producing, selling, and making a living from their work. Tina is awesome. She allows for experimentation and finding our own style."
25-02-2019T17:21:30,Mippy,She complimented my ink work
25-02-2019T17:21:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Ok. Time for it to freeze again

25-02-2019T17:37:40,Xexanoth,maybe go for a weaponized drone instead?
25-02-2019T17:37:50,ThingsAreMoving,So you essentially described a bug trap
25-02-2019T17:38:30,Xexanoth,from what i learned here is that the ideal man is an exterminator.
