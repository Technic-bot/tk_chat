24-03-2019T11:03:47,Xexanoth,And now i'm getting flashbacks to Nightmare King from hollow knight
24-03-2019T11:05:34,Azumachan,Yeah.
24-03-2019T11:08:27,iliar,"Good morning, Tom!"
24-03-2019T11:09:13,iliar,"Tom, I'm curious, is this your art? https://yadi.sk/i/DZulOriBx0Z0og"
24-03-2019T11:10:03,Azumachan,"Neat, will the riftwall be a mini comic like mm ?"
24-03-2019T11:11:26,Twokinds,Yes I've shown that one the stream a few times
24-03-2019T11:11:49,Mippy,^ was going to point that out
24-03-2019T11:11:55,Mippy,Good morning
24-03-2019T11:12:16,iliar,I probably missed it.
24-03-2019T11:15:39,Twokinds,One of my failed projects D :
24-03-2019T11:15:52,Azumachan,Don't say that.
24-03-2019T11:16:03,Twokinds,I did like the character. I wish I could have done something with her. Maybe some day I will.
24-03-2019T11:16:08,Azumachan,I think it could be a neat side comic
24-03-2019T11:52:43,Twokinds,I slept so badly last night and now I'm just exhausted and I haven't even done anything today.
24-03-2019T11:56:26,Azumachan,"Sorry to hear that, try to rest ?"

24-03-2019T13:08:21,CrRAR,Work here today is a wasteland of boredom. It's maddening.
24-03-2019T13:08:30,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-natanispincycle:
24-03-2019T13:09:05,CrRAR,So glad the winter doldrums are almost over.
24-03-2019T13:13:19,CrRAR,It feels like the whole world is spinning slower today. :|
24-03-2019T13:14:06,CrRAR,goes off to check gravitational measurements
24-03-2019T13:26:57,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-katdryer:
24-03-2019T14:00:16,CrimsonQuill,Hi
24-03-2019T14:00:19,CrimsonQuill,Evening all
24-03-2019T14:00:20,TorqueEmUp,I hope you do eventually use Windstraw. She is so friggin' adorable! >w<
24-03-2019T14:00:27,CrimsonQuill,What sketches were made yesterday night?
24-03-2019T14:24:34,CrRAR,"Nightmare rose, maren/Raine do a Baywatch rescue, Sythe/nibs tummy rubbies, Raine ref sheet was started."
24-03-2019T14:24:52,CrRAR,...a wild Eevee appeared!
24-03-2019T14:25:07,CrimsonQuill,Ok
24-03-2019T14:25:21,CrimsonQuill,What sort of character sheet?
24-03-2019T14:25:32,CrRAR,"Oh and Red gets left with ""side effects"" of Keidraification collar"
24-03-2019T14:25:35,CrimsonQuill,"Human, Halfkind, Wolf, all three, or two of the three?"
24-03-2019T14:25:40,CrimsonQuill,Oh. Side effects.
24-03-2019T14:25:44,CrimsonQuill,Oh dear.
24-03-2019T14:26:00,CrimsonQuill,I'll try my romantic scene next sketch poll...
24-03-2019T14:26:02,CrRAR,Human and wolf and hair-view.
24-03-2019T14:26:09,CrimsonQuill,Ooooh nice
24-03-2019T14:26:13,CrimsonQuill,I look forward to it
24-03-2019T14:26:23,CrimsonQuill,In 2 weeks when I finally look at it
24-03-2019T14:26:32,CrRAR,Because Raine's hair is practically its own organism.
24-03-2019T14:27:12,CrimsonQuill,"I abentmindedly started doodling in a copybook a few days ago, and then realised that I had drawn a silhouette that looked rather like Raine."
24-03-2019T14:27:44,CrimsonQuill,"All the better for future fanarts of her and Kessah as Spartans of Fireteam Luna, I suppose..."
24-03-2019T14:27:46,CrRAR,lol
24-03-2019T14:28:42,CrimsonQuill,"But yeah, I won't be looking at any of these sketches for a bit, because whenever I reread the comic, I find it best to switch off it for a two-week period beforehand. Makes the jump back in more magical."
24-03-2019T14:29:37,CrimsonQuill,And I think this weekend I'll start drawing a fantasy map-I've realised I need a setting for my OCs.
24-03-2019T14:29:50,CrimsonQuill,Is Tom ok?
24-03-2019T14:29:54,CrimsonQuill,Is he here?
24-03-2019T14:29:59,CrimsonQuill,Just want to say hi

24-03-2019T17:26:32,Twokinds,"Oh man, I had my pc case open on my bed being worked on, and I turned around and see my cat eyeing it like she wants to jump in."
24-03-2019T17:28:21,iliar,Case looks like a box - best place for cats.
24-03-2019T17:30:11,iliar,"Probably at that moment she was thinking ""Stupid people. This is a great box, why do they put stupid electronic things inside this box?"""
24-03-2019T17:36:19,iliar,Interesting. New computer will affect the speed of work on Nora cards?
24-03-2019T18:00:05,CrRAR,"Well, it is warm in there."
24-03-2019T18:05:26,CrRAR,One of the more subtle jokes in orig portal was that Rattmann used random pcs as hotplates dodging GLaDOS for survival.
24-03-2019T18:05:44,CrRAR,There were just open cases in the office areas with pots in place of the heatsinks. XD
24-03-2019T18:10:57,CrRAR,The Pentium 4 era was deservingly barbaric.
