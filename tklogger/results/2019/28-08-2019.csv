28-08-2019T13:53:29,SomeNiceUser,How is it going Sclim?
28-08-2019T13:54:14,Sclimshady,"Good, I have to go do paperwork because I just got hired on at a drilling company. HBU?"
28-08-2019T13:55:19,SomeNiceUser,"Waiting, just passing time. Maybe gonna draw or write, maybe video games too."
28-08-2019T13:56:41,Sclimshady,Drawing is a good way to pass time and get better
28-08-2019T13:57:22,SomeNiceUser,"I feel like I’m pretty terrible with drawing, but I’m gonna give it my all."
28-08-2019T13:57:59,Sclimshady,"Most people are when they start,  go look at any artists really old stuff."
28-08-2019T13:58:32,Sclimshady,The only reason artists like Tom are as good as they are is that they dedicated so much time to practice
28-08-2019T13:59:17,Sclimshady,"Indirectly, most drawing are actually 10+ years in the making, not the hours it seems like"
28-08-2019T13:59:46,Sclimshady,"GtG,  I need to turn in hiring papers"
28-08-2019T14:00:01,SomeNiceUser,"Alright, see ya Sclim!"
