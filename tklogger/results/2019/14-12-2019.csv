14-12-2019T16:08:59,HoverdudeXL,That is really bad
14-12-2019T16:09:15,Ordithus,Sometimes food makes you feel bad without it being food poisoning
14-12-2019T16:09:18,ThingsAreMoving,Depends on how bad it really is. Let the man decide for himself

14-12-2019T16:10:09,ThingsAreMoving,Why are you hating on anchovies
14-12-2019T16:10:20,AspiringNoodle,I've never had anchovies

14-12-2019T16:11:02,Ordithus,Really I'm pretty meh on them.  I'd rather have pepperoni but they're ok
14-12-2019T16:11:03,FloofyCat,@ThingsAreMoving I don't think you can make any decision with full on food poisoning other than what colour bucket you're going to throw up in
14-12-2019T16:11:24,Ordithus,"If someone thinks they protect their pizza with anchovies, ha!"

14-12-2019T18:09:03,BeeMill,Honestly I like the name Floofycat better
14-12-2019T18:09:06,unsteddyphoenix,tragic
14-12-2019T18:09:10,BeeMill,Just my take
14-12-2019T18:09:12,ShamusTheFox,Unique identities can sometimes be hard to carve out.
14-12-2019T18:09:16,unsteddyphoenix,yeah theres no cat in the other one
14-12-2019T18:09:34,ThingsAreMoving,Only floof remains
14-12-2019T18:09:55,TeapotOfDoom,Well floof is the only thing you really need tbh
14-12-2019T18:10:03,TeapotOfDoom,All the floof

14-12-2019T18:11:06,ShamusTheFox,Furpile of Rose's trimmings
14-12-2019T18:11:13,TeapotOfDoom,Now that's some relativistic floof there
14-12-2019T18:11:20,PalmettoPathfinder1,I tried to suggest a situation where FlufKevlar's character ARA has trouble with tribbles.
14-12-2019T18:11:35,BeeMill,Doesnt that go against his
14-12-2019T18:11:38,BeeMill,no OC's rule
14-12-2019T18:11:55,ProsePro7,I think its the king
14-12-2019T18:11:57,PalmettoPathfinder1,It was for FK's stream.
14-12-2019T18:12:04,BeeMill,"Oh, gotcha"
14-12-2019T18:12:12,PalmettoPathfinder1,Good catch though.
14-12-2019T18:12:12,Ordithus,"No, he'll draw other ""known"" characters, such as from other comics"
14-12-2019T18:12:24,PalmettoPathfinder1,I almost forgot to clarify that.
14-12-2019T18:12:26,IronHorseComics,like Shawa?
14-12-2019T18:12:33,IronHorseComics,no?
14-12-2019T18:12:41,IronHorseComics,it was worth a shot lol

14-12-2019T18:14:38,ShamusTheFox,"If it wasn't for one of the sketches, I wouldn't have found about Betsy and the No Evil saga."
14-12-2019T18:14:46,FloofyCat,She has so much fur it must trap a lot of body heat.
14-12-2019T18:14:47,ThingsAreMoving,"Cause she's made of snep, falangie"
14-12-2019T18:14:57,ProsePro7,@falangie123 that is the power of MILF
14-12-2019T18:15:00,falangie123,snep?

14-12-2019T18:15:32,PalmettoPathfinder1,Yeah both Adelaide and Adira are sexy moms.  :D
14-12-2019T18:15:43,unsteddyphoenix,is there a term for that?
14-12-2019T18:15:56,ThingsAreMoving,you want to keep it PG?
14-12-2019T18:16:01,ProsePro7,@unsteddyphoenix ...am I a joke to you
14-12-2019T18:16:02,FloofyCat,"Yes, Mom I'd Like To Platonically Appreciate And Cuddle."
14-12-2019T18:16:27,unsteddyphoenix,that was a test and you all passed
14-12-2019T18:16:33,TheFreindlyDeathclaw,I believe the term is Mudders

14-12-2019T18:17:47,FloofyCat,Parentally Guided Missile
14-12-2019T18:17:57,ThingsAreMoving,A flip flop
14-12-2019T18:18:17,ShamusTheFox,Adelaide: Ho ho ho and stuff. Am I doing this right?
14-12-2019T18:18:50,NezumiYuki,"No my ""King""... you need to laugh heartily and jiggle your... ummm..."

14-12-2019T18:20:09,NezumiYuki,Hey Heresy!   Uh... pretty smooth for me so far.
14-12-2019T18:20:09,ShamusTheFox,"The funny part is, no matter how scantily clad Adelaide is, it's still more decent to her than being bereft of clothing."
14-12-2019T18:20:41,FloofyCat,@AspiringNoodle Her hugs are like a trash compactor.
14-12-2019T18:20:44,HeresyArtStream,Guess I drew the short straw this week then. :B
14-12-2019T18:20:58,BeeMill,F
14-12-2019T18:21:48,NezumiYuki,Given a choice you guys... Who's Santa lap would you rather?   Adira or Adelaide?
14-12-2019T18:22:05,TheFreindlyDeathclaw,Adira for me
14-12-2019T18:22:07,ShamusTheFox,Adira. Not even a question in my mind.
14-12-2019T18:22:08,WereKeidran,Imma be honest. I believe that Bastian women are the best in Two Kinds universe. With that black furred one from the Carver epilogue being my favorite
14-12-2019T18:22:11,PalmettoPathfinder1,Can I pick both?
14-12-2019T18:22:16,AspiringNoodle,Adira

14-12-2019T18:22:34,TeapotOfDoom,hmmm...
14-12-2019T18:22:37,FloofyCat,Ummm Adira is much less scary and doesn't have guards.
14-12-2019T18:22:52,Ordithus,This outfit has the right amount of coverage
14-12-2019T18:23:14,FloofyCat,The statistically optimal amount of coverage?
14-12-2019T18:23:14,IronHorseComics,"Adira's the hot mom and Adelade is the hot queen, such a tough choice"
