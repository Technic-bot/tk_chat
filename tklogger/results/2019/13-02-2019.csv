13-02-2019T00:02:26,Dadrobit,"Also, no, I'm not gonna call this poor lady up on Valentines Day all like ""Hey, remember that guard you used to have coffee with at his guard post at the club every now and again? I'm lonely and remembered you."""
13-02-2019T00:08:21,NightMeaty22,Vday is the day i'd rather avoid but... its not like i can just hit a skip button and have it be the 15th
13-02-2019T00:08:57,NightMeaty22,Oh well
13-02-2019T00:13:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Not the opener I would’ve suggested
13-02-2019T00:14:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"I close tomorrow. Which means before I’m out, I get first pick on the discount stuff"
13-02-2019T00:14:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Really feeling some rose or red wine
13-02-2019T00:15:11,Bgrmystr2,White Wolf Wine or go home :P
13-02-2019T00:15:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe. I work the next day too & im not sure I’ll like it
13-02-2019T00:15:59,Bgrmystr2,lool
13-02-2019T00:16:58,SpazztasticKiwi,"You gonna stock up on candy, Tom"
13-02-2019T00:20:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Just managed to get a video of Bagheera passed out
13-02-2019T00:36:14,Twokinds,I can't have too much sugar.
13-02-2019T00:37:23,Dadrobit,"White wine is one drink that I absolutely can't see any benefits. They tend to have very tart, if not an outright bitterness to them."
13-02-2019T00:37:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh yea. Diet
13-02-2019T00:38:04,SpazztasticKiwi,You’re actually still on it? How’s it goin?
13-02-2019T00:38:12,Dadrobit,Very citrus-y elements in general.
13-02-2019T00:38:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Some people like the grape juice that burns
13-02-2019T00:39:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I saw one lady get a mega bottle of that barefoot - strawberry or somethin - red wine a few days ago
13-02-2019T00:40:34,Dadrobit,Shoulda just gone with the boxed wine?
13-02-2019T00:41:42,SpazztasticKiwi,I dunno. Didn’t know if it was “moms night without the kids” or “the kids were back from grandmas” situation
13-02-2019T00:42:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Or if she was just single and wanting something for the “holiday”
13-02-2019T00:43:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ll say there’s some pretty flowers though. The mini roses are always my favorite
13-02-2019T00:59:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Night Tom

13-02-2019T05:18:54,TerraTheWizard,can tell the days i was tired and added the nicknames tom gave people in the credits
13-02-2019T05:19:07,TerraTheWizard,rather than adding to their count
13-02-2019T05:48:41,TerraTheWizard,so with the fixed numbers we're back to 197 people

13-02-2019T06:10:57,ThingsAreMoving,It's huge
13-02-2019T06:11:02,TerraTheWizard,yup
13-02-2019T06:11:03,ThingsAreMoving,effort/10
13-02-2019T06:11:36,TerraTheWizard,i found out one of my counts was off because i counted one of tom's nicknames for you
13-02-2019T06:11:45,TerraTheWizard,ThingsAreFlying
13-02-2019T06:12:54,ThingsAreMoving,"It's not tom's nickname for me, lol"
13-02-2019T06:14:00,TerraTheWizard,there are a million different names for unsteddy
13-02-2019T06:15:03,ThingsAreMoving,Only the first two of my suggestions are ThingsAreMoving. All the rest is something more appropriate to the suggestions
13-02-2019T06:15:20,ThingsAreMoving,"like thingsarebalanced, flying, wrestling, etc."
13-02-2019T06:16:06,TerraTheWizard,ja
13-02-2019T06:16:47,ThingsAreMoving,only 13 more suggestions to surpass kiwibro xD
13-02-2019T06:32:43,iliar,Hm.... At least two of my suggestions was Nora Carded. And at least 3 was Color Winner. But in statistic 'Colour vote wins' and 'Nora'd' is empty
13-02-2019T06:33:34,TerraTheWizard,"yeah, i'm still filling it in"
13-02-2019T06:33:49,TerraTheWizard,only done november/december 2016 & january 2017 so far

13-02-2019T06:36:00,ThingsAreMoving,who wears them best?
13-02-2019T06:36:55,iliar,Probably I could add such information to my database. And create statistics automatically. But the biggest problem for me is that some people have a lot of names.
13-02-2019T06:37:26,TerraTheWizard,that's the reason i've decided to do it manually
13-02-2019T06:38:00,TerraTheWizard,typos & unsteppy unsteddddddddy thingsarethings
13-02-2019T06:38:05,ThingsAreMoving,"Yeeeeah, you'd need to put some exceptions. My names will always start with things, so It's manageable"
13-02-2019T06:38:16,ThingsAreMoving,but unsteppyderpyphoenix is a bit harder to do
13-02-2019T06:39:00,TerraTheWizard,xebwar changed to zebwar
13-02-2019T06:39:15,TerraTheWizard,FrSpaceWolf became FrDraw
13-02-2019T06:39:35,TerraTheWizard,Thirdkind is Prosepro7
13-02-2019T06:39:50,iliar,And how do you do it? To compile these statistics completely manually ... it is quite difficult.
13-02-2019T06:43:30,ThingsAreMoving,"Dunno, add a small script that compares strings, and if first seven or eight letters are the same then it's the same nickname?"
13-02-2019T06:43:53,ThingsAreMoving,"it wouldn't work with unfteddy, but that's a whole different case"
13-02-2019T07:00:40,Bgrmystr2,lolol
13-02-2019T07:00:46,Bgrmystr2,sounds like you guys are having fun

13-02-2019T17:24:13,Bgrmystr2,xD I highly doubt it kiwi
13-02-2019T17:24:18,Dadrobit,Usually only takes a few seconds.
13-02-2019T17:24:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Put it in the terms of service. Nobody will bother it there
13-02-2019T17:24:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Hopefully it won’t pop up with an “8 hours remaining” message
13-02-2019T17:25:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Just remember
13-02-2019T17:25:14,SpazztasticKiwi,It can smell fear
13-02-2019T17:26:30,Dadrobit,Ohhh~ a mandatory Windows update. How timely.
13-02-2019T17:26:48,SpazztasticKiwi,It smelled fear

13-02-2019T17:27:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Side note - Bagheera’s making it hard to leave for work. Might have to put down extra munchies to go

13-02-2019T17:54:53,Bgrmystr2,Me? :o
13-02-2019T18:00:44,Bgrmystr2,@TerraTheWizard you have UnstableParticle as one of the names instead of fusing it with phoenix
13-02-2019T18:01:05,Bgrmystr2,guessing that's a manual effort post-process
13-02-2019T18:07:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah you
13-02-2019T18:07:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Who else
13-02-2019T18:07:54,Bgrmystr2,"oh, okay I dunno, someone else went on somethin about jobs before I did"
13-02-2019T18:08:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Things has his interview in 12 hours was all
13-02-2019T18:08:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Though it’s more like 11 hours now
13-02-2019T18:08:41,Bgrmystr2,"there's a tech company that's moving into a new building, and they're looking for hardware IT for said building."
13-02-2019T18:09:22,TerraTheWizard,"i wasn't 100% sure it was unsteddy, so"
13-02-2019T18:09:30,Bgrmystr2,yeah it is
13-02-2019T18:09:56,Bgrmystr2,you can just fuse that name with him lol
13-02-2019T18:09:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Ok but be watching for apocalyptic instances. IT hugs are sometimes the first to go
13-02-2019T18:10:04,SpazztasticKiwi,guys
13-02-2019T18:10:15,SpazztasticKiwi,And the person in red
13-02-2019T18:12:07,TerraTheWizard,"ok, think i merged it without fucking it all up"
13-02-2019T18:12:20,Bgrmystr2,I don't see any other phoenixes
13-02-2019T18:13:00,Bgrmystr2,so you good
13-02-2019T18:13:12,TerraTheWizard,also i just made a shitty graph on the third tab
13-02-2019T18:13:15,Bgrmystr2,I was lookin for a way if there was some kind of chat feature
13-02-2019T18:13:25,Bgrmystr2,yeah I know I was playin with the box selection
13-02-2019T18:13:41,Bgrmystr2,"but it didn't seem like you noticed, or cared, or.. whether it even appeared lol xD"
13-02-2019T18:15:23,Bgrmystr2,"Yknow, at first I wasn't sure why you were making the back of the graph dark and what colors the bars would be, but yeah I can see where you went with it"
13-02-2019T18:17:31,Bgrmystr2,I wonder if it's possible to do a graph with horizontal bars rather than vertical
13-02-2019T18:18:08,Bgrmystr2,so you can see the names easier and it would likely be a bit more phone-friendly if you could just scroll up and down rather than having to drag it across your screen
13-02-2019T18:18:17,Bgrmystr2,I dunno how google docs works on mobile though
13-02-2019T18:18:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah. Depends on the program
13-02-2019T18:18:30,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, it still works fine as-is"

13-02-2019T18:26:21,Bgrmystr2,just the generic sorting from the first page?
13-02-2019T18:28:09,TerraTheWizard,"yeah, it's just going by the names order"

13-02-2019T21:04:39,unsteddyphoenix,Fight the power ord

13-02-2019T21:05:23,Xexanoth,like maddie&maeve :P
13-02-2019T21:05:30,Bgrmystr2,"hey, I'm thankful for valentines really. cuz afterwards, the chocolate is cheap as they try to get rid of all of it"
13-02-2019T21:05:50,Bgrmystr2,"so you can get some decent chocolate for cheap, or good quality chocolate for the price of cheaper brands.."
13-02-2019T21:06:23,Bgrmystr2,"also, some stores put the chocolate on sale right before or whatnot so you can still get it on the cheap when everyone else considers it ""too late"""
13-02-2019T21:07:50,Xexanoth,"i like valentines day, i just don't like all the valentines day spam that is everywhere during it"
13-02-2019T21:08:20,Xexanoth,it's pretty much one of those no internet days for me
13-02-2019T21:08:48,Xexanoth,cause there's only so many of the exact same post about valentines day everyyear that you can see...
13-02-2019T21:11:18,Ordithus,"The idea of the holiday is cute, but it is overdone for sure.  I was thinking of something involving Flora and Trace, or maybe Maren and Sythe.  Or... maybe Maren and Raine."
13-02-2019T21:11:32,unsteddyphoenix,I like that last one~
13-02-2019T21:13:14,Xexanoth,it's been a while since we had some maren&raine
13-02-2019T21:15:14,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-RainezZz: <3
13-02-2019T21:15:27,Ordithus,It's a cute ship

13-02-2019T21:18:25,Xexanoth,"but man, coming up with good ideas is hard, in the 2 years i've only come up with one idea that i actually consider ""good"""
13-02-2019T21:19:06,Xexanoth,got a lot of mid tier and one cuteness overdose but most end up being very simple fanservice :sweat:
13-02-2019T21:19:35,Xexanoth,"and by a lot i mean ""a few"""
13-02-2019T21:20:51,Ordithus,I've had a few good ones.  Some more fan-service-y than others :ctwokinds-daydreamingkat:
13-02-2019T21:21:54,Ordithus,"I think you can blame me for that trend of Therie x Daniels pieces.  There were a handful spread out, then mine, and then the flood."
13-02-2019T21:25:56,Xexanoth,"""blame""? i voted for all of those XD"

13-02-2019T21:49:50,CrRAR,Yeah it was pretty legit the reeses was a last minute epiphany.  Made SO MUCH sense.
13-02-2019T21:50:17,CrRAR,What kind of cupcake rima?
13-02-2019T21:54:53,RimaDraws,just a regular cupcake with pink frosting
13-02-2019T21:55:05,RimaDraws,and a heart decoration stuck in
13-02-2019T21:56:31,RimaDraws,its scary that my graduation day is getting closer

13-02-2019T22:17:52,CrRAR,Shirts ALWAYS inside out. D:
13-02-2019T22:20:09,SpazztasticKiwi,9:20 pm and sure enough there’s a guy in here looking for chocolates with flowers
13-02-2019T22:20:43,RimaDraws,he must be in the doghouse
13-02-2019T22:21:22,SpazztasticKiwi,He doesn’t look too panicked
13-02-2019T22:21:42,RimaDraws,neither did the one guy who came into the dollar store late at night where i used to work lol
13-02-2019T22:22:33,CrRAR,Any such things left?

13-02-2019T22:24:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Toms of chocolate and flower bunches left

13-02-2019T22:25:56,Ordithus,If the flowers are cheap enough... why not?
13-02-2019T22:26:06,Ordithus,Flowers are nice
13-02-2019T22:27:21,CrRAR,"Tulips have been quite pretty, they seem to be around early this year too."
13-02-2019T22:28:02,CrRAR,But rose are obviously most divine~
13-02-2019T22:28:12,CrRAR,*s
13-02-2019T22:28:18,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-rose:
13-02-2019T22:32:21,SpazztasticKiwi,"They got cut roses with vases this year. If they weren’t gonna die or roses didn’t have the oddest temperament of any flower, I’d take one"
13-02-2019T22:33:27,CrRAR,"Yes, very delicate."
13-02-2019T22:34:41,SpazztasticKiwi,I like the mini roses they got. In the ladybug pots
13-02-2019T22:35:36,CrRAR,"Tht sounds cute, potted ones make the most sense... the gift that keeps on giving."
13-02-2019T22:36:13,SpazztasticKiwi,They’re absolutely cute. They’re mini roses - no thorns
13-02-2019T22:36:42,SpazztasticKiwi,"And they’re in light pink, hot pink, red, and  white/purple"
13-02-2019T22:38:44,CrRAR,"Gotta stay traditional with the red, plus it matches the ladybug."
13-02-2019T22:39:10,SpazztasticKiwi,"The ladybugs come in red, pink, white, & purple"
13-02-2019T22:39:46,CrRAR,lol I was just gonna ask if the ladybugs come to match.
13-02-2019T22:40:02,CrRAR,That’s even better.
13-02-2019T22:40:15,SpazztasticKiwi,They don’t match the flower color to the ladybug. They vary
13-02-2019T22:40:29,CrRAR,"Ohhh, interesting."
13-02-2019T22:40:59,CrRAR,"A purple ladybug sounds alright, and pink too."
13-02-2019T22:41:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"At other points, they sell little owls and chicks with the roses too"
13-02-2019T22:41:46,SpazztasticKiwi,For Easter
13-02-2019T22:42:08,CrRAR,Aww
13-02-2019T22:42:11,SpazztasticKiwi,I got a yellow chick pot and white owl pot already
13-02-2019T22:42:39,SpazztasticKiwi,And a pink ladybug from another year. But they’re so hard to keep alive
13-02-2019T22:43:41,SpazztasticKiwi,They get so big they need repotting and you gotta be so careful or they die
13-02-2019T22:44:57,CrRAR,Yeah happy little roots don’t like being messed with.
13-02-2019T22:45:51,CrRAR,They can be very picky about soil type too.
13-02-2019T22:47:20,SpazztasticKiwi,I like my plants. More of a cactus person
13-02-2019T22:47:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Some bloom and you have little chance of killing them
13-02-2019T22:48:33,CrRAR,"Yeah, cactus blooms are rewarding because they’re rarer."
13-02-2019T22:49:06,CrRAR,Some are even edible!
13-02-2019T22:50:48,CrRAR,There were some pink cactus flowers when I was in the caribbean the locals like to point out all the things you can eat that are natural.
13-02-2019T22:51:04,CrRAR,lol
13-02-2019T22:52:05,CrRAR,It’s important to know what you can eat in places like an isolated tropical island.
13-02-2019T22:52:58,SpazztasticKiwi,You ever see Avatar the last air bender and that episode where Sokka drinks the cactus juice
13-02-2019T22:58:56,CrRAR,"No, wrong type of cactus juice?"
13-02-2019T22:59:05,CrRAR,Does it get trippy?
13-02-2019T23:00:34,CrRAR,Oh dear. xD
13-02-2019T23:01:06,CrRAR,Soooo... Quenchy
