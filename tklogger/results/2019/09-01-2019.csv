09-01-2019T00:16:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Looks like I’ll have to be watching Mark’s channel for a bit to make sure they don’t do it to his channel

09-01-2019T00:23:06,RimaDraws,Thank you unsteddy! I wanted to make her look a bit elegant for her design similar to her past life goddess

09-01-2019T14:19:32,Twokinds,"Are squirrels known for or associated with anything else, other than acorns?"
09-01-2019T14:22:46,TerraTheWizard,don't think so
09-01-2019T14:23:03,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
09-01-2019T14:24:26,Twokinds,Okay just curious
09-01-2019T14:24:43,Twokinds,I was hoping I could use more iconography than just an acron to associate with Mrs Nibbly
09-01-2019T14:24:49,Twokinds,But I can't think of anything else.
09-01-2019T14:28:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Hyperactivity. The tail flick. Their unique nest design (& size)
09-01-2019T14:28:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Their iconic inability to understand the best way to cross a road
09-01-2019T14:30:16,SpazztasticKiwi,And have you ever seen a squirrel or chipmunk have a temper tantrum?
09-01-2019T14:30:20,Azumachan,You don't have a character sheet about nibs ?
09-01-2019T14:39:39,Twokinds,She is just a completely normal squirrel.
09-01-2019T14:43:30,Xexanoth,"i guess the other thing squirrels are known for is the whole digging holes for food storage, so maybe you could work with that?"
09-01-2019T14:49:39,CrimsonQuill,They also hoard pinecones. Try those.
09-01-2019T14:51:55,TerraTheWizard,"there is no such thind as a ""squirrel-proof birdfeeder"""
09-01-2019T14:57:06,Twokinds,I bet I could make one.
09-01-2019T14:58:22,Twokinds,A completely sealed container. Birdseed can't come out at all.
09-01-2019T14:58:49,CrimsonQuill,"As always, your humour is brilliant."
09-01-2019T15:00:17,Azumachan,That's not squirrel proof
09-01-2019T15:00:43,Azumachan,Sealed radio antennas are usually fulls of nuts because of them.
09-01-2019T15:01:51,Twokinds,A solid ball of steel. There's no inside at all.
09-01-2019T15:02:00,CrimsonQuill,LOL
09-01-2019T15:02:03,CrimsonQuill,Rust mate
09-01-2019T15:02:10,CrimsonQuill,Unless you Galvanize it.
09-01-2019T15:02:42,Twokinds,A solid sphere of air. There's no birdfeeder at all.
09-01-2019T15:03:06,CrimsonQuill,LOL
09-01-2019T15:06:14,Azumachan,There is no protection then.
09-01-2019T15:06:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Many a video exists with squirrels trying to climb a greased feeder pole
09-01-2019T15:07:03,SpazztasticKiwi,And spinning near infinitely on a squirrel proof feeder
09-01-2019T15:07:44,CrimsonQuill,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
09-01-2019T15:08:58,Twokinds,I just have squirrel feeders that birds steal from.
09-01-2019T15:09:58,SpazztasticKiwi,You can bird proof them with bird spikes
09-01-2019T15:10:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Keeps them from being able to land on or near the feeder
09-01-2019T15:11:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Or try a squirrel proof feeder for the birds to use
09-01-2019T15:13:33,SpazztasticKiwi,We mainly get deer in our yard. Squirrels and birds would be nice - particularly cause some birds eat wasps
09-01-2019T15:14:14,Xexanoth,"we have tons of birds, we're always amazed that they're still using the bird bath at near zero degrees"
09-01-2019T15:56:12,Twokinds,New Years Resolution going strong.
09-01-2019T15:56:18,Twokinds,12 thumbnails.

09-01-2019T19:47:13,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s not completely likely to happen though. We’re not insanely close cause of distance and she just got married and planning a trip’ll take alot to do

09-01-2019T22:51:55,SpazztasticKiwi,For some reason we now own this giant honkin soup pot
09-01-2019T22:52:02,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s three people in this house
09-01-2019T22:52:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Why

09-01-2019T22:52:32,Ordithus,Soup for days and days
09-01-2019T22:52:53,Bgrmystr2,"it's okay, kiwi. People are like that"
09-01-2019T22:53:25,Bgrmystr2,the dude I live with buys $400 of food when it's just the two of them that eat it
09-01-2019T22:53:36,Bgrmystr2,cuz I eat a whole set of different food..
09-01-2019T22:53:54,Bgrmystr2,and then wonders why ppl don't eat it all. >.>
09-01-2019T22:54:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve heard of the legendary Male Appetize™️
09-01-2019T22:54:08,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, no"
09-01-2019T22:54:09,SpazztasticKiwi,That doesn’t surprise me too much
09-01-2019T22:54:17,Bgrmystr2,this guy doesn't eat that much
09-01-2019T22:54:23,Bgrmystr2,he just buys it and then lets it go bad

09-01-2019T22:54:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Can’t fix stupid
09-01-2019T22:54:40,unsteddyphoenix,If you buy in bulk its cheaper!
09-01-2019T22:54:41,Bgrmystr2,"the food, or the guy, ord?"
09-01-2019T22:54:44,SpazztasticKiwi,He got a girlfriend?
09-01-2019T22:54:52,Ordithus,Why not both?
09-01-2019T22:54:54,Bgrmystr2,I live with him and his fiancee lol
09-01-2019T22:55:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe he’s feeding his imaginary girlfriend
09-01-2019T22:55:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh
09-01-2019T22:55:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Well I didn’t mean it as “can I have a number”
09-01-2019T22:55:24,Bgrmystr2,"it's not bad for me, cuz they get tax savings due to providing for me as a 3rd party lol"
09-01-2019T22:55:31,Bgrmystr2,and it basically pays for my being here
09-01-2019T22:55:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Sounds like he’s prepared for a friend cookout
09-01-2019T22:56:01,Bgrmystr2,yeah and then noone comes by

09-01-2019T22:57:13,unsteddyphoenix,"friends are friends, not food"
09-01-2019T22:57:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Well if he’s got a fiancé he can’t be that disagreeable
09-01-2019T22:58:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Surely
09-01-2019T22:58:05,Bgrmystr2,..xD

09-01-2019T22:59:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Or maybe he’s one of those “he’s hot - & that’s all he’s got”
09-01-2019T23:00:07,Bgrmystr2,"..no I think this is just one of those ""love is blind and dumb"" cases"

09-01-2019T23:02:08,Bgrmystr2,¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I don't claim to understand love. I just know that is the stated reason.
09-01-2019T23:02:21,Bgrmystr2,so.. it's probably one of those that most people won't understand.

09-01-2019T23:04:33,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, I can see where they got the idea from, honestly."
09-01-2019T23:05:30,Ordithus,I was unaware of this.  Add it to the watch list
09-01-2019T23:05:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Princess Bride reference
09-01-2019T23:06:26,Bgrmystr2,"yeah. If you don't know what it's a rehash of, then it's a fairly enjoyable movie"
09-01-2019T23:06:46,Ordithus,But if you do?
09-01-2019T23:06:48,Bgrmystr2,"to be fair, I know exactly what it's rehashing and I still enjoyed it."
09-01-2019T23:06:51,Bgrmystr2,so there's that. xD
09-01-2019T23:07:03,SpazztasticKiwi,“Lier! Lierrrrr!” “Get back witch!” “I’m not a witch I’m your wife but after what you just said I’m not even sure I wanna be that anymore!”
09-01-2019T23:07:05,Bgrmystr2,but I'm a sucker for that kind of movie so I'm spoiled or whatever

09-01-2019T23:15:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Or the top response “oh you’ll change your mind”. Didn’t realize you knew my future better than me
09-01-2019T23:15:38,Ordithus,I like my niece and nephew.  Lots of fun.
09-01-2019T23:16:03,Ordithus,But lots of work.  And I don't have to take care of them 95% of the time
09-01-2019T23:16:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Yea. Don’t mind kids. Just don’t really want any
09-01-2019T23:17:14,SpazztasticKiwi,If I was I’d definitely more like a daughter. And likely just one kid
09-01-2019T23:17:33,Ordithus,"Once you have 12, they kind of take care of each other"
09-01-2019T23:17:38,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-keith8D:
09-01-2019T23:18:08,SpazztasticKiwi,And experience pushing 12 melons out of my skiddlyboop?
09-01-2019T23:18:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Pass
09-01-2019T23:18:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Not to mention if there’s any complications with any
09-01-2019T23:18:38,unsteddyphoenix,Put your baby in the forest to be raised by wolves
09-01-2019T23:18:46,unsteddyphoenix,No work + wolf baby
09-01-2019T23:18:47,unsteddyphoenix,Win win
09-01-2019T23:19:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah I’ll just project the pregnancy into a tree. That’ll work
09-01-2019T23:19:28,Ordithus,You could always get a kitty
09-01-2019T23:19:41,SpazztasticKiwi,I got 2
09-01-2019T23:19:49,SpazztasticKiwi,So far it works
09-01-2019T23:19:57,Bgrmystr2,"don't do that, kiwi. Then that tree dude will come into the chat one day asking if trees can get pregonate"
09-01-2019T23:20:13,Bgrmystr2,and I dunno if I have the knowledge to answer that.
09-01-2019T23:20:23,SpazztasticKiwi,No no no. It’s prégante
09-01-2019T23:20:39,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-laugh:
09-01-2019T23:20:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Or pregananat
09-01-2019T23:20:46,Bgrmystr2,spanish tree?
09-01-2019T23:21:04,Bgrmystr2,maybe only spanish trees get pregat
09-01-2019T23:22:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Wouldn’t be the weirdest theory I’ve heard
09-01-2019T23:22:46,SpazztasticKiwi,“Birth control can stop a pregnancy right?” “No” “how do you know?”
09-01-2019T23:23:11,Bgrmystr2,..because people have taken it and still got pretnat? duh
09-01-2019T23:23:22,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno, ppl just don't seem to know these things."
09-01-2019T23:24:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Skipping causes problems. And using baby oil as lube. And not using a condom. And just generally being a can shy of a 12 pack
09-01-2019T23:24:38,Bgrmystr2,lool
09-01-2019T23:25:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Stupid shouldn’t breed but here we are
09-01-2019T23:25:47,Bgrmystr2,wel.. that's usually the reason why they breed
09-01-2019T23:25:54,Bgrmystr2,because they're not smart enough to know how not to.
09-01-2019T23:26:45,Bgrmystr2,"also, I popped some bone or somethin in my leg out of place.. and then it popped back in"
09-01-2019T23:26:49,Bgrmystr2,and holy shit that hurts
09-01-2019T23:27:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Well it’s not supposed to tackle
09-01-2019T23:27:27,SpazztasticKiwi,tickle
09-01-2019T23:27:33,Bgrmystr2,"Well I HOPE it's not supposed to tackle, that'd hurt more"
09-01-2019T23:27:33,Ordithus,Don't dislocate your own hip bgr
09-01-2019T23:27:40,Bgrmystr2,naw it was around my knee
09-01-2019T23:27:51,Bgrmystr2,2nd time within a week though
09-01-2019T23:28:16,Bgrmystr2,I'm just getting up and it bends wrong.. then fixes itself and then I can't stand
09-01-2019T23:28:24,Ordithus,ow
09-01-2019T23:28:50,Bgrmystr2,"yah, it only lasts a few mins or whatever"
09-01-2019T23:28:55,Bgrmystr2,"so it's not that bad, but"
09-01-2019T23:29:05,Bgrmystr2,it's not great if it happens while I'm doin something
09-01-2019T23:29:15,Bgrmystr2,"carrying something heavy, or a drink.. or whatnot"
09-01-2019T23:29:56,Ordithus,Never had it
