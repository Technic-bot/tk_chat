30-11-2019T17:26:01,TheFreindlyDeathclaw,isn't the viking cat just not specified?
30-11-2019T17:26:08,HoverdudeXL,I think

30-11-2019T17:26:18,BadFoMo,All of the suggestions are not Human. ...That's it.

30-11-2019T18:29:10,ShamusTheFox,A tail that constantly gets caught under rocking chairs or in doors is too much.

30-11-2019T18:45:44,ThingsAreMoving,if it's instant ramen you can just make the cookie dough and focus on the ramen while they're baking
30-11-2019T18:46:00,Avolendi,"I've heared of people doing this crazy thing, asynchronous cooking. It seems to involve not dumping everything in a single pan. Most curious"
30-11-2019T18:46:09,ThingsAreMoving,"It takes ~10 minutes to make instant ramen fancy, ant that's roughly the time for cookies to bake"

30-11-2019T18:47:57,Lunarsprint,Wouldn't high resistance be better or just one extreme or the other to avoid fatal electrocution?
30-11-2019T18:48:01,TeapotOfDoom,let's look up some recipies...
30-11-2019T18:48:04,Avolendi,brb
30-11-2019T18:48:05,HoverdudeXL,I know how to cook
30-11-2019T18:48:10,tehbear,i imagine Trace will have to wear a grounding wire from now on. Kat will build it into his clothing.
30-11-2019T18:48:11,HoverdudeXL,The cookies
30-11-2019T18:48:19,Ordithus,High is always better to avoid electric shock
30-11-2019T18:48:21,TeapotOfDoom,high resistance is generally speaking better
30-11-2019T18:48:25,HoverdudeXL,Lol
30-11-2019T18:48:35,Lunarsprint,Put the lime in the koka but?
30-11-2019T18:48:41,vevans0009,Maybe he just like getting tazed?
30-11-2019T18:48:45,Lunarsprint,Nut
30-11-2019T18:48:53,unsteddyphoenix,if you had high resistence you'd just catch fire right?
30-11-2019T18:49:02,HoverdudeXL,I guessssssss
30-11-2019T18:49:05,tehbear,if there is enough amps
30-11-2019T18:49:08,TeapotOfDoom,you wouldn't even do that
30-11-2019T18:49:10,HoverdudeXL,Yea
30-11-2019T18:49:16,tehbear,but static from carpet has milli amps
30-11-2019T18:49:19,Ordithus,Flora is pretty high energy...
30-11-2019T18:49:26,Lunarsprint,Bit super low resistance would keep electric travel to skin surface
30-11-2019T18:49:30,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-FloDance:
30-11-2019T18:49:35,HoverdudeXL,My phone about to dieee
30-11-2019T18:49:37,vevans0009,She enjoy hurting her lover. ;P
30-11-2019T18:49:39,TeapotOfDoom,high resistance to ground is the reason why birds can sit on a powerline
30-11-2019T18:49:49,ThingsAreMoving,"Oheck, it's nearly midnight. Gotta bounce. See ya'll next time!"
30-11-2019T18:49:51,vevans0009,Charge it!
30-11-2019T18:49:57,Ordithus,Night Things!
30-11-2019T18:49:57,ThingsAreMoving,"Thanks for the entertainment, Tom! :ctwokinds-nibsbounce:"

30-11-2019T18:50:10,BadFoMo,Bye/good night?
30-11-2019T18:50:18,PalmettoPathfinder1,"I just realized something: are Dog, Fox, and Wolf Keidran"
30-11-2019T18:50:18,unsteddyphoenix,Have a good sleep
30-11-2019T18:50:20,Lunarsprint,True cause birds have no ground so resistance is essentially infinite
30-11-2019T18:50:26,MarvTheHugPharaoh,See ya Thing bro <3
30-11-2019T18:50:31,PalmettoPathfinder1,Dang hit the Enter key too early.

30-11-2019T18:50:41,Avolendi,Hmm. Guess videocard had a bit of an issue
30-11-2019T18:50:50,AnuSekaniArt,Later Things!
30-11-2019T18:50:58,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Are onions poisonous to Dog, Fox, and Wolf Keidrans?"
30-11-2019T18:51:00,HoverdudeXL,Ive been 4i
30-11-2019T18:51:07,HoverdudeXL,Tired this week
30-11-2019T18:51:25,Ordithus,"I think we've established keidran can eat chocolate, so they can probably eat onions"
30-11-2019T18:51:26,TeapotOfDoom,are they to acual dogs etc?
30-11-2019T18:51:46,HoverdudeXL,No they are not
30-11-2019T18:51:46,tehbear,onions make me cry
30-11-2019T18:51:48,vevans0009,Stop comparing them to lower lifeforms! lol
30-11-2019T18:51:56,HoverdudeXL,Yea
30-11-2019T18:51:56,Lunarsprint,Does Flora react to cat nip?
30-11-2019T18:52:14,MarvTheHugPharaoh,You mean trace? yes
30-11-2019T18:52:15,tehbear,i think there have been 1 or 2 cat nip skethes
30-11-2019T18:52:24,HoverdudeXL,Maybe. Cause she liked traces hair
30-11-2019T18:52:28,NeonMitsumi,https://www.deviantart.com/twokinds/art/Catnip-313263879
30-11-2019T18:52:29,unsteddyphoenix,they react to like. milk.
30-11-2019T18:52:31,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Sorry I've been binge reading Beastars and even though all of the characters are anthros, onions and chocolate are still deadly to Canines and felines."
30-11-2019T18:52:39,Zakuru,hehe
30-11-2019T18:52:44,tehbear,Neon jumps in like a Ninja
30-11-2019T18:52:47,vevans0009,Beastars is the new hotness.
30-11-2019T18:52:48,unsteddyphoenix,Of course the react to catnip they have the tolerence of squirrels
30-11-2019T18:52:53,unsteddyphoenix,Also lmao this song
30-11-2019T18:53:06,HoverdudeXL,This is a funny song
30-11-2019T18:53:15,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-nibsdance:
30-11-2019T18:53:15,ShamusTheFox,Beastars is pretty good. I am pleased by it.
30-11-2019T18:53:28,vevans0009,Great that Japan is doing anthro stuff.
30-11-2019T18:53:29,BadFoMo,I've never heard of Beastars. What's it about?
30-11-2019T18:53:30,TeapotOfDoom,:ctwokinds-nibsdance:
30-11-2019T18:53:32,PalmettoPathfinder1,Indeed it is
30-11-2019T18:53:37,Katfeathers,Fyi the toxicity of chocolate is a body mass thing
30-11-2019T18:53:45,PalmettoPathfinder1,BadFoMo it's like Zootopia but darker.
30-11-2019T18:53:50,vevans0009,WAY
30-11-2019T18:54:13,Lunarsprint,And humans have built a tolerance to it
30-11-2019T18:54:14,BadFoMo,Never seen Zootopia.
30-11-2019T18:54:18,vevans0009,ANd cel-shaded
30-11-2019T18:54:22,vevans0009,8o
30-11-2019T18:54:47,Lunarsprint,So what's next sketch?
30-11-2019T18:54:50,PalmettoPathfinder1,Carnivores and herbivores have to try and coexist with each other while repressing their animal instincts.  Which means Carnivores have to do their hardest to suppress their hunger for meat.
30-11-2019T18:55:02,vevans0009,SOme murder
30-11-2019T18:55:07,PalmettoPathfinder1,That too.
30-11-2019T18:55:08,HoverdudeXL,I forgot lol
30-11-2019T18:55:19,BadFoMo,Just lots of preview stuff and fan stuff.
30-11-2019T18:55:35,vevans0009,Dig the wolf girl
30-11-2019T18:55:44,Ordithus,"Lunar, after this is Raine in lingerie"
30-11-2019T18:55:54,vevans0009,Oh THAT one. 8>
30-11-2019T18:55:59,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-rainehappy::coffee:
30-11-2019T18:56:02,HoverdudeXL,Now me remember
30-11-2019T18:56:04,ShamusTheFox,"Beastars is a manga/anime adaptation. Centers around a scroll with students, mostly revolving around a drama club. There are various predator and prey species attending, and the carnivores have a lot of their instincts suppressed so that they can coexist"
30-11-2019T18:56:04,Lunarsprint,:ctwokinds-power:
30-11-2019T18:56:07,Katfeathers,Noice
30-11-2019T18:56:09,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Not to mention, it has a wolf falling in love with a rabbit.  Oh the wolf is big while the rabbit reaches up to his knees.  SO animals are basically realistically proporiation to their real life animal counterparts."
30-11-2019T18:56:22,vevans0009,;P
30-11-2019T18:56:32,vevans0009,Size difference
30-11-2019T18:56:41,Lunarsprint,Oh God poor bunny getting broke in half
30-11-2019T18:56:44,unsteddyphoenix,oi
30-11-2019T18:56:53,MviluUatusun,"Palmetto, they could do like the anthros in my story.  I have certain species that aren't anthro, bovines, porcines, birds, etc. and those are the ones that carnivores eat."
30-11-2019T18:57:05,unsteddyphoenix,This is a comfy g rated stream
30-11-2019T18:57:12,vevans0009,pffft
30-11-2019T18:57:41,Katfeathers,Except when it's not
30-11-2019T18:57:43,vevans0009,Evolution is quite the gamble
30-11-2019T18:57:45,BadFoMo,This is starting to sound framilair. I /may/ have seen a little bit here and there.
30-11-2019T18:58:02,Lunarsprint,Need slap that label straight to R or M
30-11-2019T18:58:10,vevans0009,NC-17
30-11-2019T18:58:12,MviluUatusun,"Well, gotta get ready to head back to work tomorrow.  After 4 days off, I may not be worth a dime at work tomorrow.  LOL."
30-11-2019T18:58:13,PalmettoPathfinder1,Actually @MviluUatusun in Beastars they can't do that. Everyone is an anthro (except for bugs).
30-11-2019T18:58:18,Ordithus,Bye Mvilu!
30-11-2019T18:58:24,BadFoMo,Bye.
30-11-2019T18:58:25,PalmettoPathfinder1,Even the fish are anthro (to a degree).
30-11-2019T18:58:30,vevans0009,^
30-11-2019T18:58:33,TeapotOfDoom,Bye Mvilu
30-11-2019T18:58:36,MviluUatusun,"That's why I like my story, Palmetto.  LOL."
30-11-2019T18:58:38,Avolendi,Gnite mv
30-11-2019T18:58:51,PalmettoPathfinder1,And there's a backalley market where carnivores can buy meat that comes from other animals.
30-11-2019T18:58:56,TeapotOfDoom,eat the bugs then
30-11-2019T18:59:00,MviluUatusun,I may be back.  It just depends on how long it takes me to get ready.
30-11-2019T18:59:02,PalmettoPathfinder1,They do eat bugs.
30-11-2019T18:59:03,vevans0009,Muahaha
30-11-2019T18:59:21,TeapotOfDoom,i heard they taste like chips
30-11-2019T18:59:30,vevans0009,WHen baked
30-11-2019T18:59:34,HoverdudeXL,Oh
30-11-2019T18:59:36,PalmettoPathfinder1,And you can eat chicken eats and drink cow's milk. Since cows and chickens do sell their eggs and milk.
30-11-2019T18:59:39,MviluUatusun,"Of course, in my story ALL of the anthros are omnivores which make for some interesting situations."
30-11-2019T19:00:00,HoverdudeXL,Ice
30-11-2019T19:00:03,HoverdudeXL,Nice
30-11-2019T19:00:05,vevans0009,You have to be an omnivore to survive ANYWHERE.
30-11-2019T19:00:07,PalmettoPathfinder1,There are some instances of....vore in the story at times.
30-11-2019T19:00:08,TeapotOfDoom,selling eggs sounds kinda weird
30-11-2019T19:00:15,HoverdudeXL,Yea
30-11-2019T19:00:15,Avolendi,Careful not to spoil to much. Probably not everyone has Obsessive Compulsive Desire-to-read-webcomic-archives-in-one-sitting
30-11-2019T19:00:24,HoverdudeXL,Yea
30-11-2019T19:00:34,Avolendi,*too
30-11-2019T19:00:34,MviluUatusun,"Anyway, BBS."
30-11-2019T19:00:43,vevans0009,just google guys.
30-11-2019T19:00:49,HoverdudeXL,Ok
30-11-2019T19:00:52,TeapotOfDoom,i've seen the trailer
30-11-2019T19:01:01,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Oh my!  I forgot about that.  Well, I'm just giving you the background setting. But yeah, that might be too much as well, since even the setting is tied to the story at times."
30-11-2019T19:01:26,SwiftKitten,i dont remeber kathrine having long hair
30-11-2019T19:01:28,HoverdudeXL,Oh
30-11-2019T19:01:31,Avolendi,"In other news, so much pink O.o"
30-11-2019T19:01:32,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Yeah, Beastars is the sort of story where even the background lore can spoil the story!"
30-11-2019T19:01:39,Ordithus,"Neither does she, swift"
30-11-2019T19:01:51,TeapotOfDoom,but now she has!
30-11-2019T19:01:52,HoverdudeXL,I would want it purple better
30-11-2019T19:02:03,SwiftKitten,look really good on her though
30-11-2019T19:02:09,HoverdudeXL,Yea
30-11-2019T19:02:25,unsteddyphoenix,it does~ :ctwokinds-daydreamingkat:
30-11-2019T19:02:27,Avolendi,Nora's next shenanigans target? :P
30-11-2019T19:02:51,vevans0009,Nora is going to meet her match someday
30-11-2019T19:03:06,HoverdudeXL,Truu
30-11-2019T19:03:08,Avolendi,"She may have already done so, but he's not interested in her"
30-11-2019T19:03:19,ShamusTheFox,"Canonically, is Nora still back at the cave recovering from the tower explosion?"
30-11-2019T19:03:22,vevans0009,NOT trace
30-11-2019T19:03:23,vevans0009,x3
30-11-2019T19:03:27,HoverdudeXL,Lol
30-11-2019T19:03:41,PalmettoPathfinder1,Yeah.  Most likely there's a dragon more powerful than her.
30-11-2019T19:03:51,vevans0009,Or AS powerful
30-11-2019T19:03:52,TeapotOfDoom,well you said she'd meet her match
30-11-2019T19:04:00,HoverdudeXL,Ima go take a shower. So brb
30-11-2019T19:04:08,TeapotOfDoom,there's always a bigger fish
30-11-2019T19:04:12,vevans0009,"""someday"""
30-11-2019T19:04:14,HoverdudeXL,Truu
30-11-2019T19:04:16,Twokinds,"For now, yeah"
30-11-2019T19:04:16,unsteddyphoenix,the closest thing she has to a match are the masks
30-11-2019T19:04:16,Avolendi,Later
30-11-2019T19:04:42,PalmettoPathfinder1,Most likely other dragons aren't too big on her interactions with lesser beings.  Heck it's even possible the Masks might even ask another dragon's help to beating Nora.
30-11-2019T19:04:47,ShamusTheFox,"Cool, thanks Tom. :)"
30-11-2019T19:04:54,vevans0009,Reni is dangerously close to the masks grasp.
30-11-2019T19:05:23,Lunarsprint,"Always a bigger fish story of my life, I just wanna eat the first fish but a bigger one keeps coming and eating my lunch"

30-11-2019T19:05:33,BadFoMo,Kathrin: Huh? Why is my hair longer? Did I stumble into 'The 10th Kingdom' or that one part of the first run of 'Fox Fire Cronicels'?
30-11-2019T19:05:46,SirEeveeDapperson,"oh wow, been following the comic for several years, never knew there was a stream"
30-11-2019T19:05:47,vevans0009,Uh....wat?
30-11-2019T19:05:58,TeapotOfDoom,Welcome then!

30-11-2019T19:06:03,vevans0009,x3
30-11-2019T19:06:03,PalmettoPathfinder1,Yeah she is. I mean there's also the chance that whatever was in that chamber with the stone guardian might also cause Nora to turn against Trace. Or the Templars might even brainwash Reni.
30-11-2019T19:06:06,ShamusTheFox,Greetings!
