03-06-2019T00:06:01,AspiringNoodle,I wonder which I will end up having enjoyed more.

03-06-2019T13:04:20,AspiringNoodle,Favorite detail is definitely the fact that her arm snapped the restraint like it was nothing.
03-06-2019T13:04:33,AspiringNoodle,All to wave to Trace!
03-06-2019T13:08:36,TerraTheWizard,stronk
03-06-2019T13:08:39,TerraTheWizard,but soft
03-06-2019T14:03:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Apparently there is a person in the Marvel movies whose sole job was to edit and scrub Loki scenes of Hiddleston’s crotch to keep it family friendly in that fitted costume
03-06-2019T14:04:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t know how to respond to this
03-06-2019T14:04:45,AspiringNoodle,I do

03-06-2019T14:09:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Hiddleston’s said his costume was hard to get into and really warm - especially with the hair added on
03-06-2019T14:09:26,SpazztasticKiwi,But that tight too? Can he breathe?
03-06-2019T14:10:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I do love the hair tho. So floof. And it’s curly at the ends
03-06-2019T14:10:31,AspiringNoodle,"Okay, I'm just imagining Loki after Hulk had his ""puny god"" moment"
03-06-2019T14:10:37,AspiringNoodle,And that's how he breathed :P
03-06-2019T14:11:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Lokiéal - because you’re worth it
03-06-2019T14:12:08,AspiringNoodle,...I watch too much YouTube :(
03-06-2019T14:12:20,AspiringNoodle,Anyone else have this problem?
03-06-2019T15:40:43,1qaz1qaz1qaz,Ruff
03-06-2019T16:18:08,RimaDraws,Same
03-06-2019T16:44:21,Orthonox,I do however I am able to curb this by using programs to block YouTube on certain time intervals so I can put attention to other stuff.
03-06-2019T16:44:37,Orthonox,"Like reading books, playing games, or learning something new."
03-06-2019T16:59:05,tehbear,"the eureka moment when ""getting it"" when learning something new is so great"
03-06-2019T17:00:19,tehbear,"but learning is hard, so ... i often resort to watching youtube/hbo/netflix :/ should just stare at wall until motivated to learn something instead :P"
03-06-2019T17:11:25,Orthonox,"For me, the hardest part is just start. Once you start doing something you are suppose to do, then the task is not as dreadful as you thought."
03-06-2019T17:11:52,Orthonox,You have to remember you are expending more energy anticipating an 'unpleasant task' than actually doing said task.

03-06-2019T18:48:07,AspiringNoodle,"I think procrastination is my biggest problem, haha."
03-06-2019T18:48:19,AspiringNoodle,Even just thinking about chipping away at my games backlog is enough to start it.
03-06-2019T21:04:08,SpazztasticKiwi,I see tiny kitten picture. Cue the high pitch awwwwwww. My cat then comes rushing to investigate her rival

03-06-2019T21:10:50,AspiringNoodle,"If you don't make some kind of high-pitched noise when seeing baby cats and dogs, then you have no soul."
03-06-2019T21:11:25,AspiringNoodle,"Also, have you seen baby bunnies?  I swear I could shatter glass <3"
03-06-2019T21:13:46,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m happy to see baby anything as long as it’s not human
03-06-2019T21:19:53,AspiringNoodle,So I'm not the only one to think newborn babies are ugly? Good to know!
03-06-2019T21:20:52,AspiringNoodle,...now I want to know if keidran / basitin babies are like human babies.  Are they cute from the getgo?  Or does it take a few months?
03-06-2019T22:02:41,RimaDraws,no i think babies are cute. if you're not an aunt or uncle you cant understand how much little humans mean
03-06-2019T22:07:32,AspiringNoodle,"I did say, keyword being, ""newborn"" ;)"
03-06-2019T22:07:58,Bgrmystr2,unfortunate that fathers and mothers will never understand :V
03-06-2019T22:08:14,RimaDraws,yea aka my sister. she is so....urrrr
03-06-2019T22:08:36,RimaDraws,"i appreciate my nieces, little cousins, and nephew so much"
03-06-2019T22:37:27,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve come to realize even I don’t know my type
03-06-2019T22:37:58,SpazztasticKiwi,And children for me are tolerable for small times
03-06-2019T22:38:06,SpazztasticKiwi,sometimes
03-06-2019T22:38:24,RimaDraws,my vacuum died....
03-06-2019T22:38:30,RimaDraws,i was almost done cleaning the floors too...
03-06-2019T22:54:01,AspiringNoodle,"Well, the odds of it dying between uses *is* rather small ^^;"
03-06-2019T22:55:46,RimaDraws,i was like almost done with the apartment and it dies
03-06-2019T22:57:38,AspiringNoodle,"Rima: ""Almost done!"" :ptv-hearts:"
03-06-2019T22:57:46,RimaDraws,nvm it overheated! IT LIVES
03-06-2019T22:57:59,AspiringNoodle,"Vacuum: ""Forgive me Rima-samaaaaaaa, I can't go on"" :ptv-whiny:"
03-06-2019T22:58:09,AspiringNoodle,Damn
03-06-2019T22:58:15,RimaDraws,yea i know lol
03-06-2019T22:58:19,RimaDraws,i was like phew
03-06-2019T22:58:42,AspiringNoodle,No funeral for vacuum-kun
03-06-2019T22:59:40,AspiringNoodle,"Aaaaaaaaaand to traumatize everyone, just imagine what *almost* happened to the vacuum is what happened to Mr. Air Conditioner from The Brave Little Toaster"
03-06-2019T22:59:50,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-hearts:
03-06-2019T23:41:22,SpazztasticKiwi,I forget that entire movie
03-06-2019T23:41:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Still got it though
03-06-2019T23:42:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Also face scrubs don’t taste as good as they smell. And I can’t seem to wash it out
03-06-2019T23:59:24,RimaDraws,i loved brave little toaster
