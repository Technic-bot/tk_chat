22-02-2019T00:00:46,Hitmanhart1,"Nice man, i just got back to my baracks in korea. I was so hyped to see the notification. lol"
22-02-2019T00:00:57,NezumiYuki,I'll take that as a 'yes'
22-02-2019T00:01:18,Hitmanhart1,I have to say I have been loving the recent character developement. It has come along way
22-02-2019T00:01:28,Hitmanhart1,since he started off
22-02-2019T00:01:41,AFallingTree,same could be said about his art
22-02-2019T00:02:06,Hitmanhart1,I know RIght! I love his grass and the nature effects he has
22-02-2019T00:02:24,NezumiYuki,"Everything about TwoKinds has grown over time. The art style, the story, the characters.   Keep it up Tom!"
22-02-2019T00:02:33,LannAF,I make a crash lannding in the strea mONCE AGAIN
22-02-2019T00:02:40,LannAF,how goes it all
22-02-2019T00:02:40,NezumiYuki,Hi Lann
22-02-2019T00:02:44,AFallingTree,hello lann
22-02-2019T00:02:48,LannAF,"hiyo again nezumi, afallingtree"
22-02-2019T00:02:57,Hitmanhart1,Tom is the man!
22-02-2019T00:03:02,LannAF,tom's a robot.
22-02-2019T00:03:05,LannAF,silly
22-02-2019T00:03:09,AFallingTree,lol
22-02-2019T00:03:10,Hitmanhart1,Hi Lann
22-02-2019T00:03:15,AFallingTree,well your not wrong
22-02-2019T00:03:20,LannAF,I've heard his mechanical noises
22-02-2019T00:03:36,PurpleLemons,"painting in the light is something I should do more, hmmm"
22-02-2019T00:04:04,SageSaga,it works best when its mostly dark to begin with
22-02-2019T00:04:11,HeresyArtStream,"If you are doing soft shading, one way you can do it is to have a round gradiant as your starting point."
22-02-2019T00:04:27,HeresyArtStream,That will inform you a bit about where the light is going to fall.
22-02-2019T00:04:56,HeresyArtStream,In the comic I'm currently drawing I had to be really conscious of where the light source is depending on which way the cahracters are facing.
22-02-2019T00:05:07,HeresyArtStream,"The whole thing takes place at night and outside, so the only light source is the moon."
22-02-2019T00:05:29,NezumiYuki,Mmmmm.... The Moon... Mmmm Beautiful...
22-02-2019T00:05:30,Hitmanhart1,that'd make sence. you wouldn't want the light sources to keep changing.
22-02-2019T00:05:37,HeresyArtStream,yep
22-02-2019T00:05:47,Bgrmystr2,I'm back! \o/ My computer decided to crash.

22-02-2019T00:05:52,PurpleLemons,it seems like this process saves a ton of time

22-02-2019T00:17:54,NezumiYuki,One light source = easy enough... Two light sources = hmmm I think I can do this.... Three or more light points = YukisBrain.exe has stopped working...

22-02-2019T00:34:33,w0lfmare,I'd buy your book if I saw you at a convention

22-02-2019T00:35:20,w0lfmare,Not this year D=
22-02-2019T00:35:29,SageSaga,:(
22-02-2019T00:35:44,RimaDraws,i wanna try to go but i dont know if money will allow me to attend two cons this year
22-02-2019T00:35:53,w0lfmare,How is anthrocon anyways? having-a-table-there wise
22-02-2019T00:36:06,SageSaga,never been- this will be my first time
22-02-2019T00:36:14,w0lfmare,Ah
22-02-2019T00:36:23,Apostrophe,I'm going to Anthrocon for the first time this summer as well
22-02-2019T00:36:29,RimaDraws,i am just finally going back to MTAC this year in my state
22-02-2019T00:36:33,w0lfmare,I've only had a table at one furry convention and I did awful
22-02-2019T00:36:40,SageSaga,buy my book then- i'll be right next to Tom
22-02-2019T00:36:48,Apostrophe,I may also do AnthrOhio since it's 10 minutes away
22-02-2019T00:38:36,NezumiYuki,I kinda wouldn't mind seeing what Nora might look like as a pure white dragon after having seen her in her base layer white.  :D
22-02-2019T00:38:47,SageSaga,i'll probably do a kickstarter- i need to sell at least 250 through kickstarter to afford printing all of em
22-02-2019T00:39:06,RimaDraws,i would definitely be one of the first few to buy through there
22-02-2019T00:39:27,SageSaga,ty Rima
22-02-2019T00:39:40,RimaDraws,just tell me a price and ill spend it
22-02-2019T00:40:03,SageSaga,im thinking 30 bucks for the book- it will be like 168-170 pages
22-02-2019T00:40:22,RimaDraws,seems reasonable . big book i suppose too?
22-02-2019T00:40:37,funnyman42,I'd buy it if I knew where to order it
22-02-2019T00:40:40,SageSaga,yeah not doing manga sized- it will be standard trade paperback size
22-02-2019T00:40:58,w0lfmare,"How many books are you printing, if you don't mind me asking?"
22-02-2019T00:41:04,funnyman42,"Can't go to any actual locatios, sadly"
22-02-2019T00:41:09,RimaDraws,ah cool then ill buy one.
22-02-2019T00:41:15,SageSaga,im aiming for 500- and that will cost around 4k
22-02-2019T00:41:32,w0lfmare,Ah cool
22-02-2019T00:41:54,NezumiYuki,Oh god...
22-02-2019T00:41:58,SageSaga,"if i can sell half- the ""profit"" from those buys the other 250 - and sales on those would be pure profit basically"
22-02-2019T00:42:03,NezumiYuki,I've just noticed a pink thing in the lower left
22-02-2019T00:42:17,NezumiYuki,Rather lood looking pink thing
22-02-2019T00:42:24,NezumiYuki,I know it's just an artifact but still..  xDDD
22-02-2019T00:42:47,SageSaga,problem is i gotta also pay for the cost of shipping and gotta pay kickstarter and pay taxes on it all
22-02-2019T00:44:10,Pwatcher67,gn all

22-02-2019T00:49:29,Bgrmystr2,"All the comics I see are fairly different sizes, there doesn't seem to be any size that most people go with."

22-02-2019T01:12:52,NezumiYuki,NO idea... but considering Dragon... I'm thinking the curtains are fire resistant.  xD
22-02-2019T01:13:07,RimaDraws,place sets on fire

22-02-2019T01:20:03,Bgrmystr2,"Honestly, it kind of feels contrary to the point"
22-02-2019T01:20:09,SageSaga,i dont recommend people doing things to people that they wouldnt like

22-02-2019T01:28:04,Bgrmystr2,yeah
22-02-2019T01:28:07,Bgrmystr2,I just checked
22-02-2019T01:28:19,Bgrmystr2,"they're okay, but they don't cook evenly."
22-02-2019T01:28:25,Bgrmystr2,"because the shape, obviously."
22-02-2019T01:28:44,MarvTheHugPharaoh,400 for 25 minutes
22-02-2019T01:28:47,Apostrophe,I had Raisin' Canes chicken tonight. Very satisfied with that decision.
22-02-2019T01:29:04,Bgrmystr2,I tend to throw em in the microwave for 2 1/2 mins.
22-02-2019T01:29:12,MarvTheHugPharaoh,theres your problem
22-02-2019T01:29:16,Bgrmystr2,"if I wanted to cook food for 25 mins, I'd make a pizza or something."
22-02-2019T01:29:20,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Oven these babies
22-02-2019T01:29:20,Bgrmystr2,fuck that noise

22-02-2019T01:29:40,Zakuru,oven is always better
22-02-2019T01:29:43,Bgrmystr2,"for all that, I'd just make homemade mcmuffins"
22-02-2019T01:30:02,MarvTheHugPharaoh,IS the McMuffin dino shaped?
22-02-2019T01:30:03,NezumiYuki,Mmmm McMuffins!
22-02-2019T01:30:13,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, I'd put em in the toaster oven if I wanted em crunchy, but my teeth are not the best"
22-02-2019T01:30:32,Bgrmystr2,so I'm rather avoiding super crunchy stuff
22-02-2019T01:30:44,Bgrmystr2,"and no marv, that's ridiculous"
22-02-2019T01:30:53,Bgrmystr2,"if you wanted to shape it as a dino, you could though."
22-02-2019T01:31:23,Bgrmystr2,"English Muffins are fairly large, you could just cut the thing in whatever shape you wanted"

22-02-2019T01:34:56,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Might as well ask for a deinosuchus at that point
22-02-2019T01:35:18,NezumiYuki,"A what now, Marv?"

22-02-2019T01:37:51,NezumiYuki,Being a scalie - mythical being or not - makes a furry like myself envious.   Wax + scales = no problem
22-02-2019T01:37:52,Dadrobit,That's what the keidran slaves are for. Just grab em by the scruff and scrub the floor clean.
22-02-2019T01:38:13,Bgrmystr2,you can only do that once though
22-02-2019T01:38:19,Bgrmystr2,cuz gl getting that shit out xD

22-02-2019T02:43:03,Bgrmystr2,I love the fact that we have a scale with zro
22-02-2019T02:43:09,BadFoMo,I thought it was.
22-02-2019T02:43:13,Bgrmystr2,and yeah just set to patrons only
22-02-2019T02:43:16,Bgrmystr2,and post it publicly

22-02-2019T02:44:10,Bgrmystr2,lol..
22-02-2019T02:44:11,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Tiny dancers
22-02-2019T02:44:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Your Patreon is mature?
22-02-2019T02:44:15,MatyMaty,I've actually been lurking for like 4 hours :P
22-02-2019T02:44:18,Ordithus,Neato Marv
22-02-2019T02:44:56,SageSaga,lurking and not responding to my messages
22-02-2019T02:45:26,MatyMaty,sorry :P
22-02-2019T02:45:27,Bgrmystr2,"tom posts stuff that he hides behind the patron-only thing all the time, and posts it publicly on his deviantart"
22-02-2019T02:45:35,Bgrmystr2,"so I mean, I don't see any reason why you can't do that as well"
22-02-2019T02:45:47,MatyMaty,Yeah Sage
22-02-2019T02:46:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m goin on to bed
22-02-2019T02:46:09,BadFoMo,Good night.
22-02-2019T02:46:10,SageSaga,Tom is also marked as Mature
22-02-2019T02:46:12,Ordithus,Night Kiwi!
22-02-2019T02:46:13,MatyMaty,yeah
22-02-2019T02:46:19,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nighty night Kiwi
22-02-2019T02:46:22,MatyMaty,is better to be marked as mature
22-02-2019T02:46:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Bye 🐥
22-02-2019T02:46:42,SageSaga,cept you get less traffic from Patreon itself because they hide you in searches
22-02-2019T02:46:56,MatyMaty,Nobody uses the Patreon search :P
22-02-2019T02:46:57,Bgrmystr2,isn't yours as well though? I'm not sure why there's a difference
22-02-2019T02:47:03,Bgrmystr2,are you trying to get un-mature?
22-02-2019T02:47:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Night streamys
22-02-2019T02:47:09,SpazztasticKiwi,And lurkers
22-02-2019T02:47:11,SageSaga,i just said i was
22-02-2019T02:47:12,Bgrmystr2,gnight kiwi
22-02-2019T02:47:12,MatyMaty,"people don't go like ""Lets look for random creators"""
22-02-2019T02:47:25,Bgrmystr2,oh I didn't know that's what you were referring to
22-02-2019T02:47:31,SageSaga,it affects SEO results though Maty
22-02-2019T02:47:54,Ordithus,It would be nice if Patreon had a halfway decent search or tagging system
22-02-2019T02:48:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Have a good night (early morning) Sage
22-02-2019T02:48:26,MatyMaty,"That is also kinda irrelevant for creators, Sage"
22-02-2019T02:48:29,BadFoMo,I call bull **** on being omited from the searches.
22-02-2019T02:48:41,MatyMaty,maybe if you are a law firm or a florist or something like that
22-02-2019T02:48:57,MatyMaty,But you don't get fans through random searches
22-02-2019T02:49:02,SageSaga,SEO affects everyones visibility
22-02-2019T02:49:13,SageSaga,i get fans from searches all the time
22-02-2019T02:49:19,MatyMaty,but not visibility to an important audience
22-02-2019T02:49:28,MatyMaty,How?
22-02-2019T02:49:30,MatyMaty,I mean
22-02-2019T02:49:55,SageSaga,people search for webcomics in the genre of things they like
22-02-2019T02:50:18,SageSaga,and people still use Google to search
22-02-2019T02:50:21,MatyMaty,"But Sage, they must be like"
22-02-2019T02:50:28,MatyMaty,thousands of fantasy webcomics
22-02-2019T02:51:14,SageSaga,yeah and if i fit better in SEO then i would appear higher up in fantasy webcomics
22-02-2019T02:51:26,MatyMaty,"and looking for ""fantasy webcomics"" gives me results that are very mature"
22-02-2019T02:51:27,BadFoMo,SEO?
22-02-2019T02:51:36,MatyMaty,with outright nudity
22-02-2019T02:51:41,SageSaga,Search Engine Optimization
22-02-2019T02:51:46,BadFoMo,Thanks.
22-02-2019T02:52:58,SageSaga,im not saying its not possible to have adult stuff show up first in SEO - im saying that some places suppress mature content and reduces visibility
22-02-2019T02:53:32,SageSaga,i get its not a huge deal- but im terrible as is when it comes to promoting- so every advantage i can get would be a benefit
22-02-2019T02:53:43,ZRO4825,He's not wrong about Patreon hiding Mature marked creators.
22-02-2019T02:54:01,ZRO4825,"I remember I was trying to search up one of the Katbox artists...Godai, I think, and could NOT find him with Patreon's search."
22-02-2019T02:54:57,MatyMaty,But if you google mastergodai
22-02-2019T02:55:03,MatyMaty,it shows up :P
22-02-2019T02:55:07,RimaDraws,maybe thats why no one can find my stuff.
22-02-2019T02:55:10,MatyMaty,"I mean, look at Oglaf"
22-02-2019T02:55:16,RimaDraws,or just not that well known
22-02-2019T02:55:34,MatyMaty,That is literally a porn comic
22-02-2019T02:56:04,MatyMaty,"what I am saying is, I don't think the SEO benefits are big enough to curtail artistic choices"
22-02-2019T02:56:47,SageSaga,my issue is they call my content adult when it isnt
22-02-2019T02:57:38,Ordithus,Dozing off... better sleep
22-02-2019T02:57:45,MatyMaty,I don't think that is really that important.
22-02-2019T02:57:56,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-RainezZz: Good night!  Thanks for the stream Sage.
22-02-2019T02:58:08,SageSaga,"I do, because my family doesnt approve"
22-02-2019T02:58:10,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nighty night Ord :cmarvthehugpharaoh-ezgifcom-crop:
22-02-2019T02:58:13,BadFoMo,Good night.
22-02-2019T02:58:22,MatyMaty,"ah, well that might be an issue"
22-02-2019T02:59:57,Bgrmystr2,"honestly, if you do this and you make money, it works"
22-02-2019T03:00:14,Bgrmystr2,I dunno.. I just don't think it's anyone's business.
22-02-2019T03:00:17,SageSaga,"i get the ""I see your patreon is still marked as Mature, this goes to show I was right all along that what you were drawing was WRONG"""
22-02-2019T03:00:38,Bgrmystr2,"it's your life, your job. You do what you do."
22-02-2019T03:00:38,MatyMaty,"well Sage, personally I think you should just do what you want"
22-02-2019T03:00:45,MatyMaty,and not what others say
22-02-2019T03:00:59,MatyMaty,if someone were to say they not aprove of girl on girl couples
22-02-2019T03:00:59,ZRO4825,"I gotta agree with that much, but I realize with family sometimes it just ain't always that easy."
22-02-2019T03:01:04,SageSaga,well unfortunately i care about those people =_=
22-02-2019T03:01:06,MatyMaty,would you stop that too?
22-02-2019T03:01:51,Bgrmystr2,"Honestly, they should accept you for who you are and what you do. The fact that they don't means they are wrong."
22-02-2019T03:02:34,SageSaga,there are levels of all of this - I dont need to be concerned about my family not approving of gay stuff- because i know they dont
22-02-2019T03:03:14,BadFoMo,Have you tried telling them that Patreon's deffenition of porn is brad enough that it can make False Positevs?
22-02-2019T03:03:24,AshtonFinel,Goodnight. I'm going to bed.
22-02-2019T03:03:31,BadFoMo,Good night.
22-02-2019T03:03:34,SageSaga,ive explained it to them
22-02-2019T03:03:42,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:eyes: those faces are really close together
22-02-2019T03:03:50,RimaDraws,i know my family dont. i cant tell them about me because of that
22-02-2019T03:03:59,SageSaga,they just think then they need to look at my stuff and just remove me from the adult filter
22-02-2019T03:04:09,BadFoMo,... *brod
22-02-2019T03:04:19,MatyMaty,"well Sage in that case why not say like, ""it is adult because there are fight scenes as such"" CoD is marked M and it hasn't a single boob :P"
22-02-2019T03:04:20,ZRO4825,*broad*
22-02-2019T03:04:21,BadFoMo,I suck at typing.
22-02-2019T03:04:33,BadFoMo,Thank you.
22-02-2019T03:04:40,ZRO4825,Boobs might actually make a CoD game worth playing!
22-02-2019T03:04:51,SageSaga,because they look at my work Maty- they are gonna see this comic too :P
22-02-2019T03:05:43,SageSaga,they hate that they cant brag about me anymore
22-02-2019T03:05:51,RimaDraws,say what
22-02-2019T03:06:06,SageSaga,they used to brag about how smart and talented i was as a kid
22-02-2019T03:06:43,ZRO4825,So...you're not as good now because they can't show you off? <_>;
22-02-2019T03:06:45,RimaDraws,i just dont tell my family my business because why should i? i mean my mom brags on me about being talented. but half my family don't know what i draw either.
22-02-2019T03:06:54,SageSaga,"now when people ask my parents how im doing its ""He's... working"" ""Oh where does he work?"" ""On... a computer"" ""Doing what?"" ""Drawing"" ""Oh hes an architect?"" ""No..."""
22-02-2019T03:07:48,RimaDraws,i would love being a comic artist. i think that makes you special enough you got a talent and you can use it. is not a bad thing. if they can't support you then they can suck it. just how i see things.
22-02-2019T03:08:08,BadFoMo,I'm afraid I don't have anything for that. Sorry.
22-02-2019T03:08:13,SageSaga,they do support me still - they are just embarrassed :P
22-02-2019T03:08:26,RimaDraws,why tho? you're so good at what you do
22-02-2019T03:08:42,ZRO4825,Because he's not drawing things they can stuff in people's faces.
22-02-2019T03:08:44,SageSaga,because my parents are old and church goin' folk
22-02-2019T03:09:02,Bgrmystr2,"they can't just say ""he's an artist"" ?"
22-02-2019T03:09:04,BadFoMo,Oh...
22-02-2019T03:09:09,SageSaga,my father is a talented Pianist and my sister is an accomplished Singer
22-02-2019T03:09:22,RimaDraws,same here but i mean
22-02-2019T03:09:28,SageSaga,I DRAW TITS
22-02-2019T03:09:35,RimaDraws,i draw the same thing sage
22-02-2019T03:09:40,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Same
22-02-2019T03:09:50,RimaDraws,and i feel i am not that special but if they saw what i drew they'd flip
22-02-2019T03:09:51,SageSaga,:P
22-02-2019T03:10:11,RimaDraws,but i am almost 32 and by god i will draw what i want
22-02-2019T03:10:12,ZRO4825,"Well, I mean, let's be honest, piano and singing are great for occasions, but titties are every day, good sir."
22-02-2019T03:10:48,MatyMaty,"ah , is late and I must head to bed"
22-02-2019T03:10:50,SageSaga,im just saying- i dont like giving them more things to pester me about
22-02-2019T03:10:55,RimaDraws,night maty
22-02-2019T03:10:55,ZRO4825,Have a g'night Maty!

22-02-2019T03:11:19,RimaDraws,i work at jack daniels part time (full time hours) and just draw on the side. im not past my degree yet.
22-02-2019T03:11:23,BadFoMo,Good night.
22-02-2019T03:11:52,MatyMaty,:ptv-sleepy:
22-02-2019T03:12:10,BadFoMo,I think I may continue my nam.
22-02-2019T03:12:19,BadFoMo,*nap.
22-02-2019T03:12:21,SageSaga,"i have very low self confidence folks, every job ive worked has been abusive"
22-02-2019T03:12:39,ZRO4825,Don't make me find a way to throw more money at you! O_O/
22-02-2019T03:12:40,BadFoMo,How so?
22-02-2019T03:12:52,RimaDraws,i mean i dont know what else to say about parents pestering. my mom would show off my art when i was a kid without telling me and it made me uncomfortable.
22-02-2019T03:13:02,SageSaga,I got moved into an empty office because the boss didnt like that people saw me
22-02-2019T03:13:10,RimaDraws,;;
22-02-2019T03:13:17,ZRO4825,NANIDAFUQ??!?
22-02-2019T03:13:22,BadFoMo,What?
22-02-2019T03:13:26,SageSaga,I was the only male employee
22-02-2019T03:13:26,RimaDraws,yea that is just abuse
22-02-2019T03:13:33,RimaDraws,thats sexism
22-02-2019T03:13:38,RimaDraws,sexist
22-02-2019T03:13:39,BadFoMo,...Where was this?
22-02-2019T03:13:40,RimaDraws,whatever
22-02-2019T03:13:57,SageSaga,Travel Agency and Caribbean property management
22-02-2019T03:14:19,RimaDraws,they were probably jealous you did a good jb
22-02-2019T03:14:34,BadFoMo,And they didn't want Male workers?
22-02-2019T03:14:37,SageSaga,i made it possible for him to take his entire business online
22-02-2019T03:15:20,SageSaga,he paid me as a graphic designer but my actual job was translating tech talk and consulting
22-02-2019T03:15:44,SageSaga,he wanted clients to come in and only see pretty young women
22-02-2019T03:16:15,RimaDraws,yea he was a pervert and weirdo
22-02-2019T03:16:15,SageSaga,he owned the building so he put me in an unused wing all by myself
22-02-2019T03:16:38,Lillyloo,As a woman I will point that this kind of enviroment is toxic for everyone
22-02-2019T03:16:40,ZRO4825,Obviously not a very smart businessman. Completely ignoring that the ladies that would come in would possibly wanna see the opposite sex too.
22-02-2019T03:17:03,Bgrmystr2,yeah zro
22-02-2019T03:17:32,SageSaga,he would call me into his office and berate me about my weight
22-02-2019T03:17:33,Lillyloo,"There are places that choose to hire ""pretty girls staff"" even if the compsny is not about makeup or beauty image"
22-02-2019T03:17:33,BadFoMo,@ZRO4825 That's what I was thinking.
22-02-2019T03:18:05,RimaDraws,yea toxic work environment
22-02-2019T03:18:24,SageSaga,then he cut my hours
22-02-2019T03:18:46,SageSaga,and then he died of a massive heart attack while combing his horses
22-02-2019T03:18:48,ZRO4825,"Yeah, fuck that guy. In the butt. With a bag of rusty corn-cob holders."
22-02-2019T03:18:51,BadFoMo,"@SageSaga I know that my 'friend' hates fat, but even he would call bull **** on that."
22-02-2019T03:19:21,Lillyloo,"they will go with the ""man want to see ladies and wonan feel more confortable arou d ladies""... well if the men in question are this disgusting than yeah"
22-02-2019T03:19:23,ZRO4825,"Aight, are you censoring yourself Fomo, or do I need to find some damned setting on picarto and kick its ass? <_<;"
22-02-2019T03:20:11,SageSaga,Zro- you should have said kicked it's **** in.
22-02-2019T03:20:14,BadFoMo,@ZRO4825 That's just me.
22-02-2019T03:20:47,ZRO4825,"I should've, but I was more annoyed at the idea that Picarto put in a swear filter than anything else. lol"
22-02-2019T03:20:52,SageSaga,so then i got a great job at a Hotel
22-02-2019T03:20:57,ZRO4825,I hate mature language filters. :joy:
22-02-2019T03:21:09,ZRO4825,The hotel with the crazy lady with the fire?
22-02-2019T03:21:15,SageSaga,that's the one
22-02-2019T03:21:54,ZRO4825,"Yeah, I've heard the stories about that place, fuck that place too."
22-02-2019T03:22:01,SageSaga,"it was great for 3 years- then i got in and my manager had been fired for no good reason, and the person i had been training and complaining about how she couldnt do anything right-"
22-02-2019T03:22:08,SageSaga,became my new manager
22-02-2019T03:22:23,BadFoMo,...Why?
22-02-2019T03:22:29,ZRO4825,That....whole process just makes my head hurt.
22-02-2019T03:22:32,SageSaga,friends with the owner
22-02-2019T03:23:04,ZRO4825,"Yeah. see, that's something that should never happen, yet it does FAR more frequently than anyone likes to admit to. -.-"
22-02-2019T03:23:07,w0lfmare,Oh boy
22-02-2019T03:23:34,SageSaga,so once she was in she started throwing people under the bus whenever something went wrong- and replaced them with her family
22-02-2019T03:23:50,Lillyloo,"incompetent people who are in the same level or up in the company is waaay to annoying -____- """" I had my fare share of that too"
22-02-2019T03:24:10,SageSaga,"then we started getting reports like ""Hey my room you sent me to- hasnt been cleaned"""
22-02-2019T03:24:38,BadFoMo,I can see that now. Friend: Sure! I can get you promoted! {Years later} Friend: WTF?! You ran my bussness into the gruond!
22-02-2019T03:25:12,ZRO4825,I wanna start up an arcade myself.
22-02-2019T03:25:28,SageSaga,"""Oh im sorry, the Managers daughter told me she cleaned all the rooms and then left with her boyfriend, i guess she lied. Guess we'll fire someone else on the house keeping staff and blame her"""
22-02-2019T03:25:29,ZRO4825,Unfortunately not sure how viable it really could be in this day and age. :c
22-02-2019T03:27:28,Lillyloo,"nah. they just hire whoever they know/ were told to and then ask why the company goes down. Well, maybe your niece and the son of your best friend are fucking INCOMPETENTS and youre giving them money to fuck things up instead of hiring who can do the job"
22-02-2019T03:28:16,w0lfmare,Working with family is usually a bad idea anyways
22-02-2019T03:28:40,SageSaga,so long story short when they tried to throw me under the bus i explained how it was impossible- and once i make sure they understood - i quit
22-02-2019T03:29:30,SageSaga,and now i take my ability to create stories and characters and try to make a living out of it
22-02-2019T03:29:33,ZRO4825,And good fucking riddance to that shithole! o_o/
22-02-2019T03:29:44,ZRO4825,I just 'bout quit my job today.
22-02-2019T03:29:53,SageSaga,and im not doing a good job of it because im living off of less than 900 dollars a month
22-02-2019T03:29:55,ZRO4825,"11am start of shift, was due out at 9pm. Didn't get out till 1am."
22-02-2019T03:32:05,ZRO4825,"I share your stuff every chance I get, Sage. I'z tries to be a good helpful fan! :c"
22-02-2019T03:32:15,w0lfmare,What did you do before Patreon?
22-02-2019T03:33:03,SageSaga,worked at a hotel...
22-02-2019T03:33:17,w0lfmare,THE Hotel?

22-02-2019T03:35:12,RimaDraws,well im sure ill still be working even if i get a comic going.
22-02-2019T03:35:22,RimaDraws,honestly love my job just some of the people
22-02-2019T03:39:36,w0lfmare,I've been quite fortunate so far
22-02-2019T03:39:41,ZRO4825,"I actually don't mind my job, I'm just fed up with being so busy that I NEVER get out at a scheduled time."
22-02-2019T03:40:21,RimaDraws,so sage do you have any kaylin dakis left?
22-02-2019T03:40:31,BadFoMo,Her lip and toung are perced?
22-02-2019T03:40:48,ZRO4825,mmm...daki...
22-02-2019T03:40:50,SageSaga,i have 3
22-02-2019T03:41:01,w0lfmare,"Mostly I've been working for family, and doing short jobs and college here and there"
22-02-2019T03:41:02,RimaDraws,oh my goodness how do i get one
22-02-2019T03:41:20,SageSaga,uhmm- what country are you in?
22-02-2019T03:41:43,w0lfmare,But frankly my days are numbered
22-02-2019T03:41:45,w0lfmare,Me?
22-02-2019T03:41:59,BadFoMo,Numbered?
22-02-2019T03:42:01,w0lfmare,United States
22-02-2019T03:42:09,SageSaga,not you w0lf
22-02-2019T03:42:09,RimaDraws,US
22-02-2019T03:42:16,RimaDraws,it should be 45$ right
22-02-2019T03:42:24,BadFoMo,Republic of Dave?
22-02-2019T03:42:33,SageSaga,it used to be - but US postage has gone up i think
22-02-2019T03:42:49,SageSaga,i think its just over 5 dollars now
22-02-2019T03:42:54,SageSaga,so 46
22-02-2019T03:43:14,RimaDraws,okay well when i get the money if you have any left then i will buy one. if i cant get one then ill just simply donate to you
22-02-2019T03:43:48,ZRO4825,keeps trying to throw money at the screen for a Toyoko daki.
22-02-2019T03:43:51,SageSaga,just email me whenever you are ready to order one - Sage25@gmail.com
22-02-2019T03:43:58,RimaDraws,i will ^^
22-02-2019T03:44:07,ZRO4825,"Oh, wait, we have a Toyoko Daki already...sorta."
22-02-2019T03:44:12,SageSaga,just need your paypal email and i'll send you an invoice
22-02-2019T03:44:21,ZRO4825,"Well, we have the images at least....Hmmmm... :thinking:"
22-02-2019T03:44:35,SageSaga,making a single Daki is expensive Zro
22-02-2019T03:44:46,ZRO4825,"That does not surprise me, sadly :("
22-02-2019T03:45:05,SageSaga,i got the 40 dakis for a great price- but it was still over 350 dollars
22-02-2019T03:46:07,SageSaga,its how i was able to sell them for 40 dollars each
22-02-2019T03:46:13,ZRO4825,"Hmm...yeah, first site I check is like $70 for a single one."
22-02-2019T03:46:26,ZRO4825,"Well, single custom one, I should say."
22-02-2019T03:46:53,SageSaga,i could probably get a single one for 30+ shipping
22-02-2019T03:47:02,SageSaga,but theres no profit in that
22-02-2019T03:47:21,ZRO4825,"Yar,"
22-02-2019T03:47:28,SageSaga,i would have to sell it at 70+ to make something off of it- and the work i put into the Kaylin and Nyna dakis?
22-02-2019T03:47:33,SageSaga,that was weeks of work T_T
22-02-2019T03:47:41,SageSaga,and i sold it for next to nothing
22-02-2019T03:48:17,ZRO4825,I <3 my Kaylin Daki.
22-02-2019T03:49:00,ZRO4825,"awwww, don't think the images from the Toyoko daki images are up to the size this site wants for standard size. :joy:"
22-02-2019T03:49:26,ZRO4825,It wants them at least 2953x8858 lol
22-02-2019T03:50:18,SageSaga,you know i dont post full res images right?
22-02-2019T03:50:42,SageSaga,what month was Toyoko Daki?
22-02-2019T03:50:47,ZRO4825,:thinking:
22-02-2019T03:50:53,ZRO4825,That...is a good question.
22-02-2019T03:50:58,ZRO4825,Lemme go lookie~
22-02-2019T03:51:08,ZRO4825,Cuz we had one side of it one month and the backside another month~
22-02-2019T03:52:30,ZRO4825,One side of it was May of 2017~
22-02-2019T03:52:55,ZRO4825,"And the other side...ahh, you found the other side, lol"
22-02-2019T03:53:22,SageSaga,2658x7567 - thats within scaling
22-02-2019T03:53:57,SageSaga,you cant zoom like that on the image posted
22-02-2019T03:54:04,MarvTheHugPharaoh,\[T]/
22-02-2019T03:54:06,ZRO4825,"Suddenly Toyoko booty as I tab away and back, lmao"
22-02-2019T03:54:06,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-ohmy: dat zoom tho
22-02-2019T03:54:11,ZRO4825,\[T]/
22-02-2019T03:54:12,Bgrmystr2,ikr zro
22-02-2019T03:54:20,SageSaga,so weird it zoomed right into her butt at first
22-02-2019T03:54:37,SageSaga,her butt really is center of the image
22-02-2019T03:54:45,ZRO4825,It makes a good focus~
22-02-2019T03:54:50,Bgrmystr2,yeh it's just the center
22-02-2019T03:56:25,ZRO4825,"It was amusing to me because I tabbed away for a second to check something, tabbed back over and suddenly booty. :joy:"
22-02-2019T03:56:38,SageSaga,but yeah- there is not enough people begging for a Toyoko daki for me to take the hit to my wallet to buy them
22-02-2019T03:56:57,Bgrmystr2,"yeah when sage zoomed in, I had the sage on fullscreen"
22-02-2019T03:57:16,SageSaga,i can guarantee Toyoko won't even sell as well as Toyoko without Zro buying them all
22-02-2019T03:57:23,Bgrmystr2,so out the corner of my eye I just saw one of my monitors fill with ass and I'm just.. wait what exactly is sage doing .. xD
22-02-2019T03:57:28,SageSaga,sell as well at Kaylin*
22-02-2019T03:57:49,SunnyVictorpage,very nice
22-02-2019T03:58:04,ZRO4825,I know I'd buy a Toyoko. Maybe Marv would too? XD
22-02-2019T03:58:25,SunnyVictorpage,I just start streaming my works today and your profile was the first one I clicked on.
22-02-2019T03:58:29,SageSaga,selling 2 is not worth spending 300 dollars on em
22-02-2019T03:58:39,ZRO4825,"Oh yeah, won't argue that at all, Sage, lol"
22-02-2019T03:58:45,SageSaga,welcome Sunny
22-02-2019T03:58:50,SunnyVictorpage,thank you
22-02-2019T03:59:10,SageSaga,wait- how did you just click here- are we on the front page?
22-02-2019T03:59:33,ZRO4825,Yup
22-02-2019T03:59:35,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Yep
22-02-2019T03:59:41,SageSaga,woot- im number one- because Tom's AFKs are still watching
22-02-2019T03:59:44,ZRO4825,First thing right up in front of it all when I loaded home screen.
22-02-2019T04:00:16,ZRO4825,Take Tom's numbers. Make them your own. Assimilate them!
22-02-2019T04:03:12,ZRO4825,Hmm...artscow.com says $24.99 for a custom daki...but also only asks for one image. :thinking:
22-02-2019T04:03:45,SageSaga,how big?
22-02-2019T04:03:51,SageSaga,maybe they do a wrap around daki
22-02-2019T04:04:34,ZRO4825,"21"" x 60"""
22-02-2019T04:04:57,ZRO4825,I think it just cheaps out and only does one side D:
22-02-2019T04:04:58,SageSaga,the image size?
22-02-2019T04:05:11,ZRO4825,6000x2100
22-02-2019T04:05:39,SageSaga,single side and lower res
22-02-2019T04:05:52,ZRO4825,"Yar, seems to be the case"
22-02-2019T04:06:07,ZRO4825,"Oh god, I just punished myself without meaning to."
22-02-2019T04:07:03,SageSaga,omg the sketch took one and a half hours folks
22-02-2019T04:07:14,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:eyes:
22-02-2019T04:07:18,ZRO4825,"to be fair, you've been pretty sidetracked a good bit during that time~"
22-02-2019T04:07:40,ZRO4825,Like hunting down random Toyoko booty. And chattering 'bout the whole jobs thing.
22-02-2019T04:07:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Thats usually how long it takes me to sketch out the pose of a piece
22-02-2019T04:08:03,SageSaga,Nyna is dom folks
22-02-2019T04:08:11,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Rock on \o/
22-02-2019T04:08:34,ZRO4825,Why do you think I didn't get the Nyna daki? Was afraid I'd wake up in the middle of the night to it taking charge. D:
22-02-2019T04:08:46,SageSaga,next week i gotta draw Nyna stripping Kaylin...
22-02-2019T04:09:03,ZRO4825,I...I need my lewd snep lady sticker right now damnit.
22-02-2019T04:09:06,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:cmarvthehugpharaoh-ezgifcom-crop8: We there dude
22-02-2019T04:10:49,Bgrmystr2,and you're just gonna let the pillow take charge zro?
22-02-2019T04:10:54,Bgrmystr2,it's a pillow.
22-02-2019T04:10:56,Bgrmystr2,ya wuss :P
22-02-2019T04:10:58,ZRO4825,It's Nyna! You don't argue with Nyna!
22-02-2019T04:11:12,ZRO4825,Kaylin you can at least get away with being sassy and she'll find it cute.
22-02-2019T04:11:23,ZRO4825,"Nyna be like ""shut up, you're mine"" o_o/"
22-02-2019T04:11:48,SageSaga,"man next week i gotta draw that tight top being teased, elf ear being nibbled - and something unmentionable"
22-02-2019T04:12:06,ZRO4825,:ptv-excited:
22-02-2019T04:12:41,ZRO4825,"awww shit, next week will also be the 1st o_o"
22-02-2019T04:12:48,SageSaga,and then a fade to black in true RPG fashion
22-02-2019T04:12:49,ZRO4825,Gotta come up with request idea! D:
22-02-2019T04:13:19,ZRO4825,"""the nipple has been freed!"" *screen fades to black* ""NO!! DAMN YOU GAME!!"""
22-02-2019T04:13:36,SageSaga,wouldnt that suck? Trapped in an RPG world- and every time you go to have sex- fade to black- and you just wake up alone...
22-02-2019T04:13:42,SageSaga,too real...
22-02-2019T04:13:53,ZRO4825,"Too real. And also, yes, that would suck terribly. :joy:"
22-02-2019T04:14:48,ZRO4825,"Fun note: Had a guy got pissy on a discord server today. Apparently his best defense against being told to be civil or be gone was to try and attack me. Oh no buddy, ya threw my details of my real life that I've thrown out in public at me. :rofl:"
22-02-2019T04:15:18,ZRO4825,"Was good for a laugh at least, lol"
22-02-2019T04:18:17,SageSaga,i think it would be worse if you were in a fantasy world game- and took off your clothes- and you had like underwear fused to your body
22-02-2019T04:18:43,ZRO4825,"Oh jeez, yeah. Hopefully that auto-underwear keeps itself magically clean, lol"
22-02-2019T04:20:57,SageSaga,that new guy is probably gone right? i should have shilled my work at em T_T
22-02-2019T04:21:15,SageSaga,im so bad at the promoting self stuff
22-02-2019T04:21:18,ZRO4825,lol
22-02-2019T04:21:50,ZRO4825,"Struck me as a non-english main-speaker who wouldn't have stuck around for long anyway, to be honest."
22-02-2019T04:21:55,SageSaga,i mean if he clicked because he liked the style then he might enjoy the work
22-02-2019T04:22:20,ZRO4825,"Possibly true, aye."
22-02-2019T04:22:54,ZRO4825,"Reminds me, I need to get back on my line work practice with people's sketches. Yours and Fluff's sketches are fun to do lines with. ^_^"
22-02-2019T04:22:56,SageSaga,like- as much as i'd like more money i'd also just like people to enjoy what i make
22-02-2019T04:23:09,ZRO4825,Why not both? o.o
22-02-2019T04:23:17,ZRO4825,"Make more money, AND make people enjoy it!"
22-02-2019T04:23:24,ZRO4825,"I mean, that's what I do, at least. :thinking:"
22-02-2019T04:23:27,SageSaga,it's easier to take someones time than money XD
22-02-2019T04:23:40,ZRO4825,but time IS money!
22-02-2019T04:23:48,SageSaga,they arent equal though
22-02-2019T04:24:05,SageSaga,work time is more valuable than free time- even if free time is more rare
22-02-2019T04:24:26,SageSaga,it spits in the face of economics!
22-02-2019T04:25:06,ZRO4825,"I try to value my free time more than my work time. Sadly, my work time still seems to make me end up with more money."
22-02-2019T04:25:34,ZRO4825,"Once I find a way to make my free time bring me in the moneyz too, then I'll have a good balance. =D"
22-02-2019T04:26:53,ZRO4825,I hear doing art in your free time is a good way to make more money. :thinking:
22-02-2019T04:27:04,SageSaga,its not free time then bro
22-02-2019T04:27:21,ZRO4825,And there-in lies the paradox!
22-02-2019T04:31:29,Bgrmystr2,"I'd say if you're not doing it to make money, but simply cuz you enjoy doing it.. and happen to make money doing it.."
22-02-2019T04:31:31,Bgrmystr2,then it's free time
22-02-2019T04:31:42,Bgrmystr2,"but if you do it to make money, even if you enjoy it, then yeh it's a job"
22-02-2019T04:32:40,SageSaga,"so you believe in the ""If you love what you do for a job you'll never work a day in your life""?"
22-02-2019T04:33:07,Bgrmystr2,Partially. Because there's always something that will make it feel like work.
22-02-2019T04:33:16,Bgrmystr2,Even playing games has moments where they're not enjoyable.
22-02-2019T04:33:38,Bgrmystr2,"Everything in moderation, even stuff you do in your free time."
22-02-2019T04:33:50,ZRO4825,Fucking stupid grinding bullshit mechanics and stupid weekly limitation bullshit in MMOs!
22-02-2019T04:33:54,ZRO4825,throws the table.
22-02-2019T04:34:10,Dadrobit,Do something that you tolerate and use it to pay for the things that you love.
22-02-2019T04:34:18,Dadrobit,S'what my pops tried to teach me
22-02-2019T04:34:25,SageSaga,i love drawing- i have a lot of fun doing it- but if anyone say's its not work? Needs to have their own teeth shot into their face by a necromancer
22-02-2019T04:35:21,ZRO4825,"won't argue that, it's definitely work"
22-02-2019T04:35:38,Dadrobit,"And yes, I wholeheartedly fucking agree with that, Sage. Applies to VO as well. ""All you do is talk. I could get the same thing for $5 on Fiverr you know!"""
22-02-2019T04:35:38,Bgrmystr2,yeah it's something you're actively trying to improve and not doing it recreationally
22-02-2019T04:35:52,ZRO4825,"I got people try and tell me ""Oh you get to sit down on the job all the time while you're driving."" If you think I'm just relaxing while driving, you're thinking wrong there! o_o/"
22-02-2019T04:36:31,SageSaga,generally anyone saying that what you do isnt work is trying to call you lazy
22-02-2019T04:37:03,Dadrobit,Or they're a cheapskate that doesn't want to pay real money but wants real work.
22-02-2019T04:37:25,SageSaga,"""oh you draw comics? I do a real job"""
22-02-2019T04:37:32,Dadrobit,"""Think of the ~EXPOSURE~ you'll get!"""
22-02-2019T04:37:42,SageSaga,meanwhile i work twice the hours they do
22-02-2019T04:38:41,ZRO4825,"I've had a couple convos where people are like ""Oh man, this artist puts out like, 5 pages a month, they do so much stuff!"" and I'm like ""So, lemme tell you 'bout this artist I follow..."" lol"
22-02-2019T04:39:25,SageSaga,ive been doing this for 15 years without missing an update
22-02-2019T04:39:36,ZRO4825,"barring spots where like, PC died and such, aye!"
22-02-2019T04:39:47,ZRO4825,And even then you usually had a nice guest filler for a day or two. =D
22-02-2019T04:39:48,SageSaga,even those- i updated with things
22-02-2019T04:39:57,Bgrmystr2,"my mother would always tell me I should charge cheap as fuck prices just cuz I need ""exposure"" when I fix comptuers on the side"
22-02-2019T04:39:58,SageSaga,or i added extra comics later to make up for it
22-02-2019T04:40:03,Bgrmystr2,ANd yeah fuck that
22-02-2019T04:41:23,ZRO4825,"""You get exposure!"" ""I can get that standing in the street, how 'bout money? That pays bills."""
22-02-2019T04:41:52,ZRO4825,Kinda reminds me of a stripper I delivered food to once.
22-02-2019T04:42:00,ZRO4825,"(Yes, that happens, lol)"
22-02-2019T04:42:40,ZRO4825,"Shit you not though, she was like ""So, if I show you my tits would that be a good tip?"" and I just deadpan looked at her and was like ""Ma'am, your tits aren't going to pay my bills."""
22-02-2019T04:43:25,LannAF,YO
22-02-2019T04:43:29,ZRO4825,"Bartender fuckin lost it for a moment, was beating on the bar while he was pointing at her. Took him probably a good minute to stop laughing, lol."
22-02-2019T04:43:32,ZRO4825,Heyyo Lann!
22-02-2019T04:43:33,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Lann
22-02-2019T04:43:38,SageSaga,Yo Lann- im still going
22-02-2019T04:43:41,LannAF,I return for the third time
22-02-2019T04:43:42,LannAF,yeah
22-02-2019T04:43:44,LannAF,I can tell!
22-02-2019T04:44:17,LannAF,how are y'all?
22-02-2019T04:44:25,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"sleepy, hbu?"
22-02-2019T04:44:26,ZRO4825,I should go to bed. I had a damned long work day. Tomorrow might be one too. And I'm tired. But I don't wanna go to bed before Sage is done. :joy:
22-02-2019T04:44:29,LannAF,Sick
22-02-2019T04:44:32,LannAF,Extremely sick.
22-02-2019T04:44:40,ZRO4825,"That's no good, Lann :c"
22-02-2019T04:44:42,MarvTheHugPharaoh,fluids and rest my lad
22-02-2019T04:44:55,SageSaga,get some sleep Zro
22-02-2019T04:45:49,ZRO4825,But Nargacuga....
22-02-2019T04:46:10,ZRO4825,"okay, that's a lie, I haven't picked up MHGU in days because other crap keeps getting in the way. :joy:"
22-02-2019T04:46:29,ZRO4825,But I wanna :ptv-confused:
22-02-2019T04:46:48,Dadrobit,Thinking about bed maybe myself.
22-02-2019T04:46:59,SageSaga,Nargacuga is easy once you learn its moves
22-02-2019T04:47:11,ZRO4825,"Yeah, it didn't seem that bad first time I fought it. Fun too!"
22-02-2019T04:47:37,ZRO4825,"Also, ty for the advice on learning that Adept style, that dodge mechanic makes GS so much fun to just charge back in to mobs, lol"
22-02-2019T04:47:49,SageSaga,yeah he likes to jump behind ya and attack- but if you have the timing right- you can look like a kungfu master and dodge without looking
22-02-2019T04:48:01,ZRO4825,I want that shit in World so I can knock Anjenath on its ass even more. :joy:
22-02-2019T04:48:32,SageSaga,Iceborne says its bringing new weapon moves - IM HOPING THEY MEAN STYLE SKILLS
22-02-2019T04:48:47,ZRO4825,That could be interesting :o
22-02-2019T04:49:07,ZRO4825,"I need to learn to use mine more often. I'm TERRIBLE about remembering to use my arts, lol"
22-02-2019T04:49:35,SageSaga,remember- if they just add new moves to existing combos- it breaks the old combos
22-02-2019T04:49:43,ZRO4825,:thinking:
22-02-2019T04:49:50,ZRO4825,"That's....a good possibility, aye."
22-02-2019T04:49:52,SageSaga,forcing everyone to relearn- they never do that in the same game
22-02-2019T04:50:19,SageSaga,so if they add styles they can have new moves and it be an option- guild style- or learn a new style
22-02-2019T04:50:36,ZRO4825,"I think it would be neat to get the Styles, but that's a pretty big change. But oh if they do that'll make things so interesting. <3"
22-02-2019T04:51:27,SageSaga,i want them but yeah i doubt it
22-02-2019T04:51:36,ZRO4825,"I'm hoping they start teasing us with more info on Iceborne soon. They probably won't since we're still like 6 months out, but I can dream, lol"
22-02-2019T04:52:02,SageSaga,they will do something either at the half way point or 1 month before release
22-02-2019T04:52:14,ZRO4825,That and I'm torn on if I'm gonna go for it on PS4 or PC first.
22-02-2019T04:52:16,SageSaga,they usually wont even say the release DATE until the month before
22-02-2019T04:52:21,SageSaga,PC
22-02-2019T04:52:40,ZRO4825,"Well, yeah, I wanna go PC cuz it just runs so damned much better, but my main friend I play the game with is locked to PS4 ^^;"
22-02-2019T04:52:45,SageSaga,im hoping they release at the same time
22-02-2019T04:53:00,ZRO4825,"I am too, honestly. If it comes down to it I'll just save up and snag it for both I figure."
22-02-2019T04:53:23,ZRO4825,"MHW hooked me that good, I admit, that I picked it up for both systems. Kinda like Nioh did."
22-02-2019T04:53:35,SageSaga,does your friend like big boobs and butts?
22-02-2019T04:54:00,ZRO4825,"Not as much as I do, lol. He actually took the game Azure Nights back because the main character had a huge rack and it aggravated him. :joy:"
22-02-2019T04:54:36,SageSaga,"darn i was gonna say you can taunt him into PC with the ""Thicc Female"" body mods"
22-02-2019T04:55:06,ZRO4825,"I already was playing around with the longer hair style mods, lol. I haven't looked into the body mods yet though. :o"
22-02-2019T04:56:02,SageSaga,I always try to get Kaylin the larger chest when its available - its often costume dependent - but hey- i got her elf ears
22-02-2019T04:57:15,ZRO4825,=D
22-02-2019T04:58:49,SageSaga,"Styles really did quadruple the ""weapons"" basically"
22-02-2019T04:59:24,SageSaga,btw- Arch Tempered Kushula is easy
22-02-2019T05:00:09,SageSaga,i killed him 4 times last night out of 5- the first time i failed was i went to lance sleep bomb him- forgot windproofing
22-02-2019T05:00:32,SageSaga,grabbed my thunder bow and destroyed him
22-02-2019T05:01:07,ZRO4825,Nice ^_^
22-02-2019T05:01:29,ZRO4825,"I'm not a good bow user, so Kushala remains on my ""Fuck that damned thing"" list, lol"
22-02-2019T05:01:43,SageSaga,bowgun?
22-02-2019T05:01:44,ZRO4825,That stupid knockback melee wall aggravates the hell out of me. :rofl:
22-02-2019T05:01:57,SageSaga,get windproof then and go at em
22-02-2019T05:02:21,ZRO4825,"I'm not really good with the ranged weapons in general. I mean, I can heavy bowgun,  but I feel like I gotta be doing something wrong with'em, because it feels like I ain't doing shit, lol"
22-02-2019T05:02:40,SageSaga,you are doing it wrong then
22-02-2019T05:03:03,ZRO4825,"I figure as much, aye, lol"
22-02-2019T05:03:10,SageSaga,"""are you using normal shot?"" if you answer yes- you are doing it wrong"
22-02-2019T05:03:41,ZRO4825,"Wyvernsnipe is fun though, gotta admit that, lol"
22-02-2019T05:04:26,SageSaga,"""What gun should i be using?"" ""Do you want to be a GOD?"" ""uhhh- sure?"" ""Then the Deviljho heavy bowgun- the Dark Devourer"""
22-02-2019T05:05:09,ZRO4825,"I love most of the Deviljho weapon designs, but ye gods I hate that Affinity- on them"
22-02-2019T05:05:13,SageSaga,"""Ok i got the gun but its not doing that much damage-"" ""What ammo are you using? If you say anything other than cluster you are doing it wrong"""
22-02-2019T05:05:32,ZRO4825,"Yeah, there's that too, I'm not really great with Clusters, lol"
22-02-2019T05:06:01,SageSaga,did you see a group beat extreme behemoth in like 5 minutes?
22-02-2019T05:06:28,ZRO4825,"I did not, but I'm not surprised. Some peeps make me look like a freaking newblet who just picked up a controller, I swear, lol"
22-02-2019T05:06:45,SageSaga,oh wait- 2 minutes and 30 seconds
22-02-2019T05:06:47,SageSaga,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyO_QX2qEKQ
22-02-2019T05:07:35,ZRO4825,"okay, Team Darkside. I definitely believe it then, lol."
22-02-2019T05:09:50,ZRO4825,"Oh fuck that. I unload entire inventories worth of sleep ammo into mobs and they won't sleep, wth, lol"
22-02-2019T05:10:33,SageSaga,a sleep 2 ammo shot does like 150 sleep
22-02-2019T05:10:45,Rosscoe,Good mornings @.@

22-02-2019T05:36:00,Dadrobit,Currently looking into a few radio stations I can maybe at least get an internship at.

22-02-2019T05:38:52,unsteddyphoenix,Yesss.
22-02-2019T05:39:04,unsteddyphoenix,Just make your own radio station? :D
22-02-2019T05:39:19,Dadrobit,That's moderately very illegal.
22-02-2019T05:39:33,Dadrobit,Pirate radio is definitely a thing though.
22-02-2019T05:39:35,unsteddyphoenix,So youre saying theres a chance
22-02-2019T05:40:06,Dadrobit,I'm more looking at this as a chance to embed myself in the industry with folks who are more or less on the up and up.
22-02-2019T05:41:04,Dadrobit,"Also, I really don't want to fuck with the radio waves in and around my house with a fire station less than half a mile away. If I were to accidentally fuck with them, that would not end well for anyone involved."

22-02-2019T14:49:08,CrRAR,"Ahhh yes, the limitless distraction that is the internet~"
22-02-2019T14:52:44,SpazztasticKiwi,There is a thing you can buy online that dams your front door in case of floods
22-02-2019T14:53:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Doesn’t help now but if you want to look at it for a possible next time it protects against the first threeish feet of water
22-02-2019T14:54:39,SpazztasticKiwi,"Other than that, there’s a door seal that packs under the front door to seal it from water"
22-02-2019T15:00:12,BadFoMo,Yo.
22-02-2019T15:00:17,SageSaga,yo

22-02-2019T15:05:23,SageSaga,just sent ya the tracking info though- not that the international tracking is very good.
22-02-2019T15:05:58,SageSaga,"its usually like ""Left location"" ""On a plane"" ""In customs for Unknown period of time"" ""At your home"""
22-02-2019T15:07:31,sunblaze,currently in queens :P
22-02-2019T15:07:42,sunblaze,but sure it'l work thanks
22-02-2019T15:08:19,SageSaga,wow it's in queens already? Thats a long ways from here- must be going out from the international airport there
22-02-2019T15:10:08,sunblaze,I jsut hope customs in germany will not annoy me.
22-02-2019T15:10:18,sunblaze,I hate driving to them 25km away
22-02-2019T15:10:19,raenirsalazar,this looks cute :)
22-02-2019T15:10:49,SageSaga,thanks
22-02-2019T15:11:11,SageSaga,have you seen the comic before?
22-02-2019T15:11:51,raenirsalazar,nope
22-02-2019T15:11:53,raenirsalazar,bookmarked it
22-02-2019T15:12:21,raenirsalazar,out of curiosity do you also happen to do commissions?
22-02-2019T15:12:52,SageSaga,I do when I have time
22-02-2019T15:13:30,raenirsalazar,Do you happen to have a list of prices? :)
22-02-2019T15:14:19,SageSaga,"usually 30 dollars for a sketch, 60 for a colored image. +10 for 2 character sketch, +20 for 2 character color"
22-02-2019T15:15:06,raenirsalazar,Thanks!
22-02-2019T15:15:55,SageSaga,"np. I don't have any particular time i ""open"" for commissions- just when people ask for something I figure if i have time to do it and either give an estimate time table or just accept to work on it asap"
22-02-2019T15:16:13,raenirsalazar,Gotcha
22-02-2019T15:16:37,raenirsalazar,I'm working on a game and every two paychecks I go down the list of whose available to comm for concept art for it :)
22-02-2019T15:17:01,raenirsalazar,So basically I've added you to that list :)
22-02-2019T15:17:12,SageSaga,"thanks, good luck with your game"
22-02-2019T15:17:31,BadFoMo,"Dang. ...Also, is there a list of restrictions on what may be commissioned posted anywhere?"
22-02-2019T15:17:50,raenirsalazar,If you need to ask if something is restricted it probably is :D
22-02-2019T15:18:00,BadFoMo,"Uh, the 'dang' was for the prices."
22-02-2019T15:18:31,SageSaga,those prices are pretty low really.
22-02-2019T15:18:49,raenirsalazar,Yeah they're pretty good prices.
22-02-2019T15:19:00,BadFoMo,True.
22-02-2019T15:19:03,Bgrmystr2,I'm curious what kinda game
22-02-2019T15:19:03,sunblaze,they are yes somewhere between low and fair
22-02-2019T15:19:07,sunblaze,certainly not high
22-02-2019T15:19:14,kittyelfie,hi
22-02-2019T15:19:21,SageSaga,howdy Kitty
22-02-2019T15:19:40,raenirsalazar,"Persona 2 x Neverwinter Nights 2 sort of game, the bastard love child of a JRPG and a CRPG."
22-02-2019T15:20:06,sunblaze,huh? interesting combo
22-02-2019T15:20:09,SageSaga,lol - someone named Kitty elfie shows up when i have a Nekomata and an Elf kissing on screen...
22-02-2019T15:20:10,raenirsalazar,If haven't seen high until you commission european artists and pay the exchange rate in Euros or British Pounds (#Worthit)
22-02-2019T15:20:21,BadFoMo,'C' RPG?
22-02-2019T15:20:39,raenirsalazar,Baldur's Gate / Neverwinter / Pillars of Eternity / Divinity Original Sin
22-02-2019T15:20:59,BadFoMo,Uh...
22-02-2019T15:21:04,raenirsalazar,western dungeons and dragons derived computer rpgs
22-02-2019T15:21:07,sunblaze,well none of those IS this combo so its sure something new
22-02-2019T15:21:27,BadFoMo,C = Combo?
22-02-2019T15:21:32,raenirsalazar,C = Computer
22-02-2019T15:21:41,BadFoMo,Ah. Thanks.
22-02-2019T15:21:52,raenirsalazar,"Computer RPG, since you're playing a pen and paper game on the pc"
22-02-2019T15:22:02,raenirsalazar,and probably lewds.
22-02-2019T15:22:12,sunblaze,^:ptv-hearts:
22-02-2019T15:22:20,BadFoMo,Now I get it!
22-02-2019T15:22:42,raenirsalazar,I'm not going to have them unless of course I can make them mechanically interesting and distinct from other examples in the hentai game genre though.
22-02-2019T15:24:06,raenirsalazar,"The general aim for the lewd gameplay is the ability to have an interactive sex scene basically anywhere,"
22-02-2019T15:24:15,BadFoMo,@SageSaga That panel before the lick; I'm reminded of that one .gif with the Cherry.
22-02-2019T15:24:42,raenirsalazar,The lick and kiss in the comic is very nice Sage
22-02-2019T15:24:46,raenirsalazar,gaaah
22-02-2019T15:24:49,SageSaga,i dont see it...
22-02-2019T15:25:18,raenirsalazar,sexually aggressive kity best kity
22-02-2019T15:25:20,BadFoMo,"Hmm, must be just me then."
22-02-2019T15:26:04,raenirsalazar,I'm reminded of this one lewd story about a woman turned into a succubus and this other girl turned into a neko and the neko basically jumps on her for lewds
22-02-2019T15:26:47,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-ohmy:
22-02-2019T15:27:13,Bgrmystr2,Was it Japan?
22-02-2019T15:27:16,Bgrmystr2,sounds like japan.
22-02-2019T15:28:46,raenirsalazar,it was some fantasy transformation story on the transformation story archive site
22-02-2019T15:30:54,Bgrmystr2,lolo
22-02-2019T15:31:10,Bgrmystr2,"wow sage, you filled in the colors on this page real quick"
22-02-2019T15:32:08,SageSaga,i am empowered by the presence of someone here being named Kittyelfie
22-02-2019T15:33:32,Xexanoth,*The power of Kyttyelfie shines within you*
22-02-2019T15:33:46,Xexanoth,and of course i immediately fucked up the name...
22-02-2019T15:33:50,Xexanoth,go me
22-02-2019T15:40:26,Bgrmystr2,haha gg
22-02-2019T15:40:48,SageSaga,i was about to say- why is no one talking to help erase Xexanoth's shame?
22-02-2019T15:41:02,raenirsalazar,gotta let them stew in it for a while
22-02-2019T15:41:25,SageSaga,nah we good folks
22-02-2019T15:41:34,SageSaga,typos happen!
22-02-2019T15:41:36,raenirsalazar,how lewd does your comic get Sage or is it mainly kissing and hand holding?
22-02-2019T15:41:46,SageSaga,XD
22-02-2019T15:42:10,raenirsalazar,to be clear I'm asking for a friend
22-02-2019T15:42:11,SageSaga,I generally dont make things very lewd- the next comic is about as lewd as i go
22-02-2019T15:42:24,raenirsalazar,hrm
22-02-2019T15:42:30,sunblaze,ohhh thats promising :D
22-02-2019T15:42:37,raenirsalazar,We shall see!
22-02-2019T15:42:53,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Someone say....Lewd?:cmarvthehugpharaoh-ezgifcom-crop8:
22-02-2019T15:43:12,raenirsalazar,the audience demands lewds!
22-02-2019T15:43:28,SageSaga,they can demand with their wallet
22-02-2019T15:43:39,raenirsalazar,*tempted*
22-02-2019T15:43:57,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"I demand more wholesome cuteness, but lewd is welcomed here and there"
22-02-2019T15:44:06,raenirsalazar,yeah
22-02-2019T15:44:18,raenirsalazar,lewds is how wholesome cuteness deepens romance
22-02-2019T15:44:23,RimaDraws,hi sage
22-02-2019T15:44:25,SageSaga,"the most ive been offered to do a lewd of a character of mine was 300 dollars, I turned it down"

22-02-2019T15:45:21,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Just recently sage I found out what its like to have a character or characters you don't want lewds of.
22-02-2019T15:45:22,SageSaga,oh right- my Daki's are about as lewd as i go
22-02-2019T15:45:49,sunblaze,300 for kate?

22-02-2019T15:47:51,RimaDraws,i havent read yosh yet
22-02-2019T15:47:56,RimaDraws,yes i did ^^
22-02-2019T15:48:03,SageSaga,glad to hear it
22-02-2019T15:48:10,RimaDraws,i love it :3
22-02-2019T15:48:22,RimaDraws,i only had a few pages to read.
22-02-2019T15:49:29,SageSaga,side note- licking elves grants good luck
22-02-2019T15:49:44,RimaDraws,ooooh ~
22-02-2019T15:49:51,sunblaze,I can believe that
22-02-2019T15:50:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,That explains the relationship between legolas and gimli
22-02-2019T15:50:25,RimaDraws,this is looking great. ill brb gotta mop the floors.
22-02-2019T15:54:04,sunblaze,yo tom
22-02-2019T15:54:27,SageSaga,not sure if hes watching
22-02-2019T16:02:11,RimaDraws,back
22-02-2019T16:02:37,SageSaga,wb
22-02-2019T16:02:41,RimaDraws,ty
22-02-2019T16:07:10,CatzArt,hey all
22-02-2019T16:07:49,SageSaga,y'all know that the gods of Middle Earth are dicks right?
22-02-2019T16:08:03,BadFoMo,Nope.
22-02-2019T16:08:14,CatzArt,no
22-02-2019T16:08:22,RimaDraws,hm?
22-02-2019T16:08:32,sunblaze,not only the gods but pretty much anyone older then
22-02-2019T16:08:37,sunblaze,100 years
22-02-2019T16:09:00,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, I wouldn't expect anything otherwise."
22-02-2019T16:09:23,Bgrmystr2,They've put up with so much shit over a century that I Don't think they give a fuck about anyone.
22-02-2019T16:09:25,SageSaga,so the gods of creation in middle earth were all working on their own creations- and one of them was tasked with the formations of the world- well that god was upset that he had to play with mud and dirt while everyone else got to make creatures
22-02-2019T16:09:34,SageSaga,so he secretly created dwarves
22-02-2019T16:10:01,SageSaga,and as punishment when they found out they made it so dwarves didnt get an afterlife
22-02-2019T16:10:17,Bgrmystr2,yeah punish the dwarves.. not the god.
22-02-2019T16:10:21,Bgrmystr2,smart. xD
22-02-2019T16:10:48,SageSaga,well think about it- thats pretty much a punishment
22-02-2019T16:11:01,SageSaga,"""When your toys break we wont replace them- and they WILL break!"""
22-02-2019T16:11:16,Bgrmystr2,"I did think about it. And it's a punishment for the dwarves. Not the god. If he can make dwarves, then he can make other things."
22-02-2019T16:11:19,SageSaga,"*Elves smash dwarves* ""You guys are dicks!"""
22-02-2019T16:11:25,Bgrmystr2,"He's not incapable, and clearly they didn't stop him."
22-02-2019T16:11:33,Bgrmystr2,so.. not seeing a negative for him at all
22-02-2019T16:12:09,SageSaga,you arent very imaginative then...
22-02-2019T16:12:11,raenirsalazar,iirc the first dwarves were about to be smashed but they were spared since they showed fear and Iru took pity on them
22-02-2019T16:12:21,RimaDraws,thats pretty funny
22-02-2019T16:12:48,SageSaga,yeah i think thats right Raenir
22-02-2019T16:12:51,raenirsalazar,"i'm not sure they dont have an afterlife, I think its the same as all of them, they all go to the halls of mandos"
22-02-2019T16:13:12,Bgrmystr2,Lol sage.. punishing someone for someone else's mistake.. yeah that doesn't require imagination. That's just sad.
22-02-2019T16:13:14,SageSaga,no they dont have an afterlife- only one dwarf has been allowed into an afterlife
22-02-2019T16:13:15,raenirsalazar,considering tolkien's catholic faith itd be really weird if they didnt
22-02-2019T16:13:30,raenirsalazar,going to the Undying Lands isnt the same thing as having an afterlife
22-02-2019T16:13:40,raenirsalazar,the Halls of Mandos *are not* the same as the Undying Lands
22-02-2019T16:13:44,SageSaga,Gimli was allowed to go with Legolas into the Elven afterlife
22-02-2019T16:13:54,raenirsalazar,nooooo thats not what that means
22-02-2019T16:14:28,raenirsalazar,"the Undying Lands i.e where the Two Trees of Valinor are, is just like Mount Olympus but a continent instead of a mountain."
22-02-2019T16:14:36,SageSaga,Bgr- if you punish someones children you are punishing the parent too- it affects them both
22-02-2019T16:14:37,raenirsalazar,or analogous to the gardens of eden
22-02-2019T16:15:00,sunblaze,only if the parent gives a shit about his creations
22-02-2019T16:15:04,raenirsalazar,"the elves left the gardens to pursue war vs Melkor, it would be weird to be able to exit and enter your afterlife at will"
22-02-2019T16:15:38,Bgrmystr2,I disagree. The children here are proof of that.
22-02-2019T16:15:41,raenirsalazar,"originally the Elves were created in Middle Earth and then invited to Valinor, and then returned for the war of the similirils"
22-02-2019T16:16:18,Bgrmystr2,Punishing a child doesn't make any difference to the parent if the parent doesn't care.
22-02-2019T16:16:19,raenirsalazar,So Frodo/Legolas/Sam/Gimli going to the Undying Lands isnt them going to the Afterlife.
22-02-2019T16:16:34,raenirsalazar,its going to where the Gods (the Valar) live.
22-02-2019T16:16:59,raenirsalazar,"but it isnt eternal, eventually they will die there and end up in the Halls."
22-02-2019T16:17:30,Bgrmystr2,Is this Lord of the Rings lore? :o
22-02-2019T16:17:38,SageSaga,yeah but im not sure if its all correct
22-02-2019T16:17:53,sunblaze,thats probably the part I napped of reading the simarillion
22-02-2019T16:17:59,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
22-02-2019T16:18:05,SageSaga,i could be wrong- but i dont have time to check it or call up Eric
22-02-2019T16:18:16,raenirsalazar,gotta read the Simililirion and the other works
22-02-2019T16:18:18,raenirsalazar,https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/111653/in-lotr-is-there-an-afterlife
22-02-2019T16:18:26,Bgrmystr2,I'm sure eric is a but busy trying to find Keidran Singles in his area..
22-02-2019T16:18:32,Bgrmystr2,he might not respond to your messages for a bit
22-02-2019T16:18:48,Bgrmystr2,a bit*
22-02-2019T16:18:48,SageSaga,we have a rule against posting links without permission
22-02-2019T16:19:00,Bgrmystr2,yeh it's under the stream
22-02-2019T16:19:05,raenirsalazar,Okay sorry
22-02-2019T16:19:19,Bgrmystr2,you ask first :u
22-02-2019T16:19:29,raenirsalazar,"Nevertheless, if you google ""is there an afterlife in middle earth"" what was said earlier is wrong."
22-02-2019T16:19:39,SageSaga,Eric is a friend of mine- he's read every book by Tolkien and even has the one ring tattooed around his arm
22-02-2019T16:20:02,RimaDraws,dayum
22-02-2019T16:20:12,SageSaga,yeah i googled it and one of the first things said is that it's believed that the Dwarves return to the earth
22-02-2019T16:20:23,sunblaze,did he tripple/quadrupple check that they got the words correct?
22-02-2019T16:20:25,BadFoMo,...Why his arm and not a finger?
22-02-2019T16:20:50,sunblaze,probably to amplify and better read it
22-02-2019T16:21:16,BadFoMo,That makes sence.
22-02-2019T16:21:32,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno, I think being on the finger makes way more sense"
22-02-2019T16:21:43,Bgrmystr2,it's like a placeholder till he gets the actual ring.
22-02-2019T16:21:54,Bgrmystr2,and he'll know exactly where to put it.
22-02-2019T16:22:05,SageSaga,they also say they think dwarves may be reincarnated - or more specifically the 7 kings?
22-02-2019T16:22:57,raenirsalazar,"I just checked briefly, it may be that the *Elves think* the Dwarves return to stone"
22-02-2019T16:23:20,raenirsalazar,IIRC its Durin that reincarnates
22-02-2019T16:23:35,raenirsalazar,Durin reincarnates again for the last time to retake Moria.
22-02-2019T16:23:39,raenirsalazar,IIRC
22-02-2019T16:24:38,raenirsalazar,"though the Dwarves do have something like the short end of the stick aside from their afterlife, iirc they basically just die off at the end of the 5th age before our ""real"" human history begins"
22-02-2019T16:25:32,raenirsalazar,"Though the blog I just found says some other things, like after the final battle the dwarves get revived to help Aule rebuild the Earth, etc."
22-02-2019T16:26:07,raenirsalazar,Supposedly this is in the Silmilirion
22-02-2019T16:26:13,SageSaga,i just found it- Dwarves believe that they do go to an afterlife- it's just in an area of the halls separate from all the other races that their creator created for them
22-02-2019T16:26:31,raenirsalazar,Sounds right
22-02-2019T16:26:38,SageSaga,"basically ""Nah kid- when we die we go to heaven too- it's just- more of a hole in the wall our god made for us"""
22-02-2019T16:27:15,raenirsalazar,Halls separate doesn't necessasarily mean its worse.
22-02-2019T16:27:59,BadFoMo,[Insert Bender quote about Blackjack and Hookers here.]
22-02-2019T16:28:06,raenirsalazar,"Though one thing to keep in mind Tolkien would complain quite regularly that he wasn't satisfied with a lot of things he wrote, such as his depictions of the orcs as fairly one dimensional monsters and so on."
22-02-2019T16:28:21,SageSaga,from the way it is worded it sounds like a way to make dwarven children not cry about dying and becoming nothing but dirt
22-02-2019T16:28:41,raenirsalazar,"But we don't know that though, elves weren't right about a lot of things."
22-02-2019T16:29:33,raenirsalazar,and any abscence or detail could fall under a category of things Tolkien probably wanted to revisit later to make better align with his faith.
22-02-2019T16:30:44,raenirsalazar,"The elf girl is exceptionally pretty Sage, I like how you draw her breasts; from the spider web pattern I assume she's sorta like a drow?"
22-02-2019T16:31:08,RimaDraws,its a special clothing? iirc
22-02-2019T16:31:24,sunblaze,darkelf yes
22-02-2019T16:31:33,SageSaga,she's a dark elf but not a Drow
22-02-2019T16:31:38,sunblaze,but since she was raised by humans I doubt she behaves like one
22-02-2019T16:31:50,SageSaga,there's a distinction between them in this fantasy story
22-02-2019T16:31:53,raenirsalazar,Aha
22-02-2019T16:31:53,sunblaze,also drows may be copyrighted :D
22-02-2019T16:32:16,SageSaga,Drow are the deep elves and Dark Elves are just that- dark skinned- related to the Moon Elves which are very fair skinned
22-02-2019T16:32:32,raenirsalazar,Aha
22-02-2019T16:32:42,Bgrmystr2,"what kind of description is ""deep"""
22-02-2019T16:32:46,SageSaga,So she's not from the underground
22-02-2019T16:32:48,raenirsalazar,underground caves
22-02-2019T16:32:55,Bgrmystr2,ahh
22-02-2019T16:32:55,raenirsalazar,like Deep Gnomes
22-02-2019T16:32:57,SageSaga,yeah Drow in DnD are from the Underdark
22-02-2019T16:33:06,raenirsalazar,reminds me I should read Drow Tales sometime
22-02-2019T16:33:24,SageSaga,an underground world- and their skin is mostly purples and jet black values
22-02-2019T16:33:32,Bgrmystr2,"I'd understand a deep cave, but deep person.. doesn't really tell me anything cuz they can just go to the surface and then.. are they deep anymore? xD"
22-02-2019T16:33:46,SageSaga,but Dark Elves and Moon elves dance naked under the full moon :P
22-02-2019T16:33:50,sunblaze,I stopped after it got way to colvitung. kern writes good stuff but ALL the spinnoffs kinda made it way to confusing
22-02-2019T16:34:01,raenirsalazar,its terminology thats more familiar if you've read Forgotten Realms books
22-02-2019T16:34:12,raenirsalazar,hell yeah naked dancing ftw
22-02-2019T16:34:16,Bgrmystr2,eh :u
22-02-2019T16:34:26,RimaDraws,forgotten realms? who wrote that?
22-02-2019T16:34:29,raenirsalazar,uh
22-02-2019T16:34:32,raenirsalazar,a bunch of authors
22-02-2019T16:34:36,SageSaga,lots of people XD
22-02-2019T16:34:37,raenirsalazar,its a fantasy setting
22-02-2019T16:34:43,raenirsalazar,like Dragonlance
22-02-2019T16:34:53,raenirsalazar,and also has specific D&D rulebooks for it
22-02-2019T16:35:03,RimaDraws,i have a book about drizzt do'urden a drow elf
22-02-2019T16:35:15,SageSaga,by RA Salvatore
22-02-2019T16:35:18,RimaDraws,it was the first three about him
22-02-2019T16:35:19,RimaDraws,YES
22-02-2019T16:35:20,raenirsalazar,all of the editions of D&D take place in Greyhawk by default but there's Forgotten Realms specific books too
22-02-2019T16:35:27,RimaDraws,i need to finish it
22-02-2019T16:35:27,raenirsalazar,RA Salvatore is alright
22-02-2019T16:35:29,SageSaga,not true
22-02-2019T16:35:34,raenirsalazar,he has a loooot of books though
22-02-2019T16:35:44,SageSaga,The main world of 5th edition is Forgotten Realms
22-02-2019T16:35:49,SageSaga,not Greyhawk
22-02-2019T16:36:17,raenirsalazar,"maybe thats true of 5th edition but up til 3.5 it was greyhawk, Mordekainen isn't from Fearun"
22-02-2019T16:37:06,SageSaga,I think 4th edition may have been Eberon originally
22-02-2019T16:37:24,raenirsalazar,"perhaps more accurately each edition of D&D doesnt assume a particular setting, which is why ""Magic of Faerun"", ""Lords of Waterdeep"" etc, are all their own books to specifically flesh out specific settings."
22-02-2019T16:37:42,raenirsalazar,Magic Trains that run on time
22-02-2019T16:37:54,SageSaga,those were all 3 and 3.5 though
22-02-2019T16:38:51,raenirsalazar,"Right, which was a fairly large proportion of D&D even with 4th edition"
22-02-2019T16:39:05,SageSaga,"why hasnt anyone yelled ""NERDS!"" yet?"
22-02-2019T16:39:12,raenirsalazar,because we're all nerds
22-02-2019T16:39:14,RimaDraws,NERD
22-02-2019T16:39:15,sunblaze,^that
22-02-2019T16:39:16,RimaDraws,lol
22-02-2019T16:39:35,BadFoMo,I didn't think to do it.
22-02-2019T16:39:37,sunblaze,all too fmailliar with the stuff so why call it out? :D
22-02-2019T16:39:38,raenirsalazar,"those breasts by virtue of being more anatomically accurate, look so nice and fuller :)"
22-02-2019T16:39:54,raenirsalazar,omg just noticed the choker
22-02-2019T16:40:05,sunblaze,indeed proper breasts are a good point for anatomy.
22-02-2019T16:40:37,raenirsalazar,"I find I'm too distracted by ""That doesn't look too accurate"" to enjoy a lot of artists with larger sizes"
22-02-2019T16:40:44,SageSaga,her chest piece grants spider climb
22-02-2019T16:40:51,raenirsalazar,:D
22-02-2019T16:41:30,Bgrmystr2,I wouldn't yell it cuz that guy always sounds like an asshole anyway
22-02-2019T16:41:41,sunblaze,ohhhh good place to store all those magical clothes. craft spider climb on my fishnet :P
22-02-2019T16:41:48,raenirsalazar,hehe
22-02-2019T16:42:02,raenirsalazar,btw is this read left to right or right to left
22-02-2019T16:42:17,sunblaze,usally top left to bottom right
22-02-2019T16:42:25,raenirsalazar,gotcha
22-02-2019T16:42:44,SageSaga,yeah im not printing it backwards XD
22-02-2019T16:42:59,SageSaga,(and yes it would be backwards since im printing in the US)
22-02-2019T16:43:04,DutchMaster,Oh hello ^.\
22-02-2019T16:43:22,SageSaga,howdy Dutch
22-02-2019T16:43:25,Bgrmystr2,"Reminder than sage flips the page on the stream to look for imperfections, so go by what's posted on the site when he updates the comic page."
22-02-2019T16:43:36,DutchMaster,Ha ^.^ Howdy partner
22-02-2019T16:43:41,Bgrmystr2,heya dutch
22-02-2019T16:43:46,RimaDraws,the flip tool is a helpful one
22-02-2019T16:43:49,SageSaga,this is the correct way right now
22-02-2019T16:43:59,Bgrmystr2,ah okay
22-02-2019T16:44:15,DutchMaster,"Woah, dats looking cute /.\"
22-02-2019T16:44:17,Bgrmystr2,Yeah I wasn't sure if Kaylin had the sad face before or after the kiss xD
22-02-2019T16:45:31,raenirsalazar,sad that it ended amirite
22-02-2019T16:45:52,SageSaga,?
22-02-2019T16:45:59,sunblaze,kinky nyna seems to get aroused by doing gruesome violence just for fun
22-02-2019T16:46:05,sunblaze,:P
22-02-2019T16:46:23,SageSaga,no- she's frustrated and wants to unwind
22-02-2019T16:46:44,sunblaze,shhhh leave me in my mindbubble :ptv-nope:
22-02-2019T16:46:48,SageSaga,not hot and bothered from all the murder
22-02-2019T16:47:08,raenirsalazar,"I was making a joke that if her face was sad *after* being kissed, its a ""why did you stop!"" sad"
22-02-2019T16:48:15,Bgrmystr2,lol I was more concerned that it had to do with dialogue
22-02-2019T16:49:46,DutchMaster,"Nah, my suggestion is bad /.\ Ill keep it to myself."
22-02-2019T16:52:00,SageSaga,"hmm im gonna need to have a scene where a Deep elf shows up and Relm is like ""Hey Kaylin! We got another elf like you around!"""
22-02-2019T16:52:36,DutchMaster,Idk about anything ^.\ im new here fam :]
22-02-2019T16:53:35,SageSaga,http://sage.katbox.net/?webcomic_url=webcomic2-last

22-02-2019T16:55:33,SageSaga,site's kinda dull right now- used to look like this -  http://ai.katboxad.net/
22-02-2019T16:56:06,SageSaga,but we reset the server to fix some issues- and are slowly refitting all the diddly bits to make it all pretty again XD
22-02-2019T16:56:23,SageSaga,diddly bits sounds so suggestive-
22-02-2019T16:57:01,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-ohmy:

22-02-2019T17:04:36,SageSaga,"he basically greats someone saying ""Hi you fingering hoe Neighbor"""

22-02-2019T17:12:19,SageSaga,i probably cant see it on my own channel because it's my channel XD
22-02-2019T17:12:44,SageSaga,"i was trying to open it up in the app on my phone to find it and im like ""Waaaait a second"""
22-02-2019T17:12:53,Lillyloo,the app is the opposit of intuitive xD
22-02-2019T17:13:33,Lillyloo,"you may think the heart is like instsgram/facebook likes but no, its the follow button"
22-02-2019T17:14:37,SageSaga,well thank you for the help ^_^
22-02-2019T17:20:10,SageSaga,some times i wonder... how many people in the world want me dead?
22-02-2019T17:20:46,RimaDraws,i dont <3
22-02-2019T17:21:11,SageSaga,"well im always bothered by the fact that I cant say ""None"""
22-02-2019T17:21:39,Lillyloo,"meh, evem if some do, just dont make them happy and keep going xD"
22-02-2019T17:23:02,SageSaga,yeah but because of it im worried about going to a convention where they let people cover their faces
22-02-2019T17:23:17,SageSaga,and im going to a furry con this year for the first time- it might be my last...
22-02-2019T17:24:04,RimaDraws,whys that?
22-02-2019T17:24:30,CrRAR,hater's gonna hate~
22-02-2019T17:24:42,SageSaga,because furry cons allow people to wear masks?
22-02-2019T17:25:47,sunblaze,and you fear someone is a killer with a mask just for you?
22-02-2019T17:25:54,SageSaga,you cant see the seething rage from their facial expression as the big dumb dog face of the costume approaches you before she jabs a pen in your neck
22-02-2019T17:26:27,sunblaze,in that case just look at carneval in rio
22-02-2019T17:26:28,RimaDraws,ive never been to a furry con
22-02-2019T17:26:49,sunblaze,noone knows al those around them. most can not even guess who it might be.
22-02-2019T17:26:58,sunblaze,still having fun and no murders hidden
22-02-2019T17:27:08,sunblaze,(despite what movies might tell about that)
22-02-2019T17:27:08,SageSaga,how do you know?
22-02-2019T17:27:22,SageSaga,if they are hidden really well- you shouldnt know right?
22-02-2019T17:28:23,BadFoMo,Wear a mask yourself and have a few others wearing masks too so no one knows which one is you?
22-02-2019T17:28:26,sunblaze,sure there are morons and probably some haters as well. likely at least
22-02-2019T17:28:51,sunblaze,but 99% are fine people and the 1% left is to busy hating the other ones in a costume to see you as a target
22-02-2019T17:28:58,SageSaga,i told yall about my dream where a guy in a fursuit stabbed me and then used my blood to dye his fursuit red right?
22-02-2019T17:29:35,sunblaze,no but I can iamgeine that as the culprilt
22-02-2019T17:29:37,BadFoMo,...I think I may have heard of something like that.
22-02-2019T17:29:53,Bgrmystr2,yes sage
22-02-2019T17:29:54,Bgrmystr2,I was there
22-02-2019T17:30:03,Bgrmystr2,"and probably because you were likely there, Fomo"
22-02-2019T17:30:28,BadFoMo,"Tom and Ron were there and did nothing, right?"
22-02-2019T17:31:03,SageSaga,"""you are wanted for murder"" ""Impossible, there is no proof, that person was stabbed by a White Dog, I am clearly a red dog"" ""Well its true they did say the stabber was white"""
22-02-2019T17:32:46,BadFoMo,"""We're going to have to confescate your suit for DNA testing."""
22-02-2019T17:33:12,Bgrmystr2,because they totally won't be able to tell it's blood or anything..
22-02-2019T17:34:04,SageSaga,no one said dreams had to be logically sound
22-02-2019T17:34:18,sunblaze,and yu have roughly 5 litres of blood in your body.
22-02-2019T17:34:26,sunblaze,way to few to dye a fursuit :D
22-02-2019T17:35:14,SageSaga,XD
22-02-2019T17:35:24,SageSaga,he turns around to leave the cops and his back is totally white
22-02-2019T17:36:01,sunblaze,ha what a giveaway :D
22-02-2019T17:36:21,sunblaze,catch that white dog! *turns around*
22-02-2019T17:36:22,sunblaze,white dog?
22-02-2019T17:37:07,SageSaga,"CSI style they dont notice until later all of them are sitting around the office talking about the case- and one of them is like ""Hey we just got the report on the body- all the blood is gone"""
22-02-2019T17:37:33,SageSaga,"""As you can see- im a red dog, you are looking for a white dog"" *Flash of him turning around with the white back*"
22-02-2019T17:37:50,sunblaze,conclusion: Mr tepes is in the US!

22-02-2019T17:53:24,sunblaze,now I am curious of the HUD kaylin can see. perhaps there is a lust-meter

22-02-2019T18:08:32,SageSaga,?
22-02-2019T18:08:45,SpazztasticKiwi,You were streaming late
22-02-2019T18:09:02,SageSaga,yeah- i finished my work as i said i would before i went to bed- around 7am
22-02-2019T18:09:08,Rosscoe,was after 7am my time in the Atlantic when he was STILL streaming
22-02-2019T18:09:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Nice
22-02-2019T18:09:36,Ordithus,Yikes that was a long and late stream
22-02-2019T18:09:51,SageSaga,9 hours and 45 minutes was where i stopped the stream
22-02-2019T18:10:00,SageSaga,so 6:45
22-02-2019T18:10:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Only nine hour stream I’ve watched was Mark playing RDR2
22-02-2019T18:10:59,SpazztasticKiwi,And I’m still not through it
22-02-2019T18:16:40,Ordithus,I'm getting PTSD from that animation sage used to show all the time when afk... the one with the tongue and the cherries
22-02-2019T18:16:47,Ordithus,shudders
22-02-2019T18:17:30,SageSaga,Nyna's tongue is a lot more sexy
22-02-2019T18:18:05,Ordithus,Far less disturbing at the least :P
22-02-2019T18:18:19,FoxxTrotter,:fox:
22-02-2019T18:21:28,SageSaga,i think it's done?

22-02-2019T18:22:01,Ordithus,Looks nice!
22-02-2019T18:23:37,Bgrmystr2,it looks good :O

22-02-2019T18:23:48,SageSaga,im gonna grab some water- look it over folks- let me know- brb
22-02-2019T18:24:30,Rosscoe,Lets go over the lewd list for tonights page
22-02-2019T18:24:58,Rosscoe,"*Spit, check, embracing, check. Hard eye stare while flushing face red, check"
22-02-2019T18:25:24,BadFoMo,Katana Tail?
22-02-2019T18:26:40,Bgrmystr2,spit is not check btw
22-02-2019T18:26:42,Bgrmystr2,there is no spit
22-02-2019T18:26:52,Rosscoe,I highly doubt anything good will become of that tail cept for something to hold onto
22-02-2019T18:27:05,Rosscoe,"slavia and spit, same thing XD"
22-02-2019T18:27:12,Bgrmystr2,yes and there is none.
22-02-2019T18:27:17,Bgrmystr2,oh there IS
22-02-2019T18:27:33,Bgrmystr2,I mean.. okay but it's not saucy or anything so
22-02-2019T18:27:37,Bgrmystr2,I wouldn't consider it a check lol
22-02-2019T18:28:04,SageSaga,its sexy not sloppy
22-02-2019T18:28:14,Bgrmystr2,Katana tail for sure if Kaylin had one
22-02-2019T18:28:26,Bgrmystr2,and saucy does not equal sloppy
22-02-2019T18:28:47,Bgrmystr2,saucy would more mean sexy
22-02-2019T18:28:52,BadFoMo,Katani Pony Tail then?
22-02-2019T18:29:04,Bgrmystr2,lool
22-02-2019T18:29:12,Bgrmystr2,naw
22-02-2019T18:29:13,BadFoMo,*Katana
22-02-2019T18:29:33,Bgrmystr2,hair isn't like tail so unfortunately
22-02-2019T18:29:43,FoxxTrotter,Nope.
22-02-2019T18:29:59,SageSaga,Kaylin's hair is so long it would be more like a nodachi pony tail
22-02-2019T18:30:14,BadFoMo,Nodachi?
22-02-2019T18:30:28,Ordithus,"A longer sword than a katana, fomo"
22-02-2019T18:31:22,SageSaga,Nodachi
22-02-2019T18:31:33,BadFoMo,I may need to look that one up.
22-02-2019T18:31:43,BadFoMo,...Nevermind.
22-02-2019T18:31:47,Rosscoe,A Great Katana
22-02-2019T18:31:53,Ordithus,beeeg sword
22-02-2019T18:32:12,BadFoMo,How was such a think used?
22-02-2019T18:32:14,Rosscoe,Only those who trained and built up enough muscle would be deemed worthy of wielding one of those
22-02-2019T18:32:17,SageSaga,i think it's main use was against horsemen
22-02-2019T18:32:26,Rosscoe,"much like hte british Long bow men, need GREAT Strenght to draw them bows"
22-02-2019T18:32:30,Ordithus,That looks way bigger than a claymore
22-02-2019T18:32:46,Rosscoe,"Horses, or swaths of intarty"
22-02-2019T18:33:07,Bgrmystr2,damn that's a big sword
22-02-2019T18:33:08,SageSaga,it really wasnt good against infantry
22-02-2019T18:33:30,SageSaga,one soldier just blocks it and the others kill him
22-02-2019T18:34:17,Ordithus,How much does that thing weight?
22-02-2019T18:34:28,SageSaga,surprisingly light actually
22-02-2019T18:34:35,BadFoMo,Really?
22-02-2019T18:35:20,Rosscoe,Japanese Steel
22-02-2019T18:35:31,Rosscoe,swords were crafted to be strignt on edge side
22-02-2019T18:36:21,SageSaga,it has nothing to do with it being japanese steel
22-02-2019T18:36:31,Ordithus,Steel is steel in terms of weight
22-02-2019T18:36:40,SageSaga,japanese steel is actually notoriously poor quality
22-02-2019T18:36:52,BadFoMo,Really?
22-02-2019T18:36:57,Rosscoe,Your on an island
22-02-2019T18:37:02,Rosscoe,Not much space metal around
22-02-2019T18:37:05,unsteddyphoenix,Thats why they gotta fold it 1000 times
22-02-2019T18:37:08,unsteddyphoenix,Also hi
22-02-2019T18:37:10,Ordithus,They had really bad ore
22-02-2019T18:37:11,BadFoMo,Yo.
22-02-2019T18:37:12,Ordithus,Hi steddy
22-02-2019T18:37:13,Rosscoe,*pokes*
22-02-2019T18:37:14,SageSaga,yeah- they had to do a ton of work to get it to a useable level
22-02-2019T18:37:19,SageSaga,thats why they folded it so much
22-02-2019T18:37:27,Ordithus,"In the end, they could make some incredibly fine weapons"
22-02-2019T18:37:42,SageSaga,it was the folding technique that made up for the poor quality
22-02-2019T18:38:00,Rosscoe,They cheap easy though
22-02-2019T18:38:06,Ordithus,"Differential hardening too, the edge  is harder than the spine"
22-02-2019T18:38:07,SageSaga,but all it did was move the impurities around- spread them out so the metal would make up the majority of the blades structure
22-02-2019T18:38:59,SageSaga,what made them light was just the fact that they were drawn out so thin and the distal taper of the blade
22-02-2019T18:39:35,SageSaga,now they were still heavy- but if you ever held a replica sword - they feel heavy- a real sword though is surprisingly light
22-02-2019T18:39:53,Ordithus,"Still, a sword that large would weigh quite a bit.  8-10 lb?"
22-02-2019T18:40:14,Rosscoe,Google surely has the answer
22-02-2019T18:40:21,Ordithus,"I think european greatswords were around that weight, though they had much larger guards than this"
22-02-2019T18:41:02,SageSaga,5-8 lbs i think
22-02-2019T18:41:15,BadFoMo,That much?!
22-02-2019T18:41:32,Rosscoe,Yup
22-02-2019T18:41:37,SageSaga,like swinging around a really long cat
22-02-2019T18:41:41,Ordithus,haha
22-02-2019T18:41:55,SpazztasticKiwi,My cats more 10 pounds
22-02-2019T18:42:02,SpazztasticKiwi,ish
22-02-2019T18:42:16,SageSaga,i meant to say long young cat
22-02-2019T18:42:25,Rosscoe,"Euro swords were built around being strong and hard to break, The Suadi's were abut razor sharpness that cuts silk just by letting it glide over the edge, then japan, trying to be abit of A. and B."
22-02-2019T18:42:29,SageSaga,most cats at maturity weight 10-15lbs
22-02-2019T18:42:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera’s three this July
22-02-2019T18:43:06,Rosscoe,Any house cat is over weight
22-02-2019T18:43:27,Rosscoe,"I found out your suppose too feed them once a day,"
22-02-2019T18:43:32,Rosscoe,"I did it twice a day, OOOPS"
22-02-2019T18:43:44,Ordithus,But the cat will beg and beg and beg for more
22-02-2019T18:43:49,LannAF,YO
22-02-2019T18:43:52,Rosscoe,yup
22-02-2019T18:43:52,BadFoMo,Yo.
22-02-2019T18:43:53,FoxxTrotter,"Hi, Lann."
22-02-2019T18:43:53,Rosscoe,you let it
22-02-2019T18:43:54,SpazztasticKiwi,I feed mine once a day and they’re still a lil heavy
22-02-2019T18:43:58,Rosscoe,Hoi Lann!

22-02-2019T18:44:29,BadFoMo,Add a Cherry.
22-02-2019T18:44:32,Ordithus,nooooo
22-02-2019T18:44:35,unsteddyphoenix,Processing...
22-02-2019T18:44:38,LannAF,It's shaped a little weirdly
22-02-2019T18:44:45,LannAF,for it to be considered sexy imo.
22-02-2019T18:45:01,Rosscoe,Shes not entirely a human being either XD
22-02-2019T18:45:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Just in time for me to go back in from lunch
22-02-2019T18:45:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Bye bye
22-02-2019T18:45:13,LannAF,"mostly just the thickness, I think. If you're extending it (especially as a cat hybrid) it probably wouldn't be shaped like that"
22-02-2019T18:45:17,Ordithus,See ya Spazz
22-02-2019T18:45:37,FoxxTrotter,"C-ya, Kiwi."
22-02-2019T18:45:39,SageSaga,man- do people not know what tongues look like?
22-02-2019T18:45:46,Ordithus,Seems not
22-02-2019T18:45:52,LannAF,Considering my girlfriend does that to me often
22-02-2019T18:45:57,LannAF,and I just asked her too
22-02-2019T18:45:57,BadFoMo,...Does she have a rough Cat tougue?
22-02-2019T18:45:58,LannAF,...yes?
22-02-2019T18:46:04,unsteddyphoenix,Brag about it
22-02-2019T18:46:22,LannAF,I'm just saying I have a good reference for it haha

22-02-2019T18:46:38,LannAF,"at the very least, the transition from thick to thin is a bit too harsh"
22-02-2019T18:46:40,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-reniderp_flip:
22-02-2019T18:46:51,unsteddyphoenix,tfw no rough cat tongue gf :/
22-02-2019T18:46:55,LannAF,It's kinda nitpicking though.
22-02-2019T18:47:07,LannAF,man a cat gf tongue would kinda suck though.
22-02-2019T18:47:16,LannAF,Cheetah tongues can make you bleed
22-02-2019T18:47:18,SageSaga,tongues have this interesting thing about them- they are just a creepy muscle that can flex and change in many ways XD
22-02-2019T18:47:23,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah no thats true
22-02-2019T18:47:42,LannAF,"Yeah, but in an instance where you're trying to lick someone, I'm just saying it's a little different from what I've experienced"
22-02-2019T18:47:44,unsteddyphoenix,Unless it was like...a half human half cat tongue
22-02-2019T18:47:48,LannAF,But some people's tongues are different for sure
22-02-2019T18:47:54,unsteddyphoenix,Thatd be interesting :thinking:
22-02-2019T18:47:55,LannAF,hm
22-02-2019T18:48:02,LannAF,"Yeah it might be, unsteddy"
22-02-2019T18:48:10,LannAF,but honestly I'd be a little nervous
22-02-2019T18:48:20,LannAF,That one is pretty good  sage
22-02-2019T18:48:27,unsteddyphoenix,Elon Musk needs to hurry up and make catgirls so we can answer these questions
22-02-2019T18:48:32,LannAF,It's simplistic but works well
22-02-2019T18:49:13,Ordithus,Kaylin was not expecting this.  Still seems to be processing it quickly
22-02-2019T18:49:44,LannAF,Foxgirls or bust
22-02-2019T18:49:45,LannAF,kthx
22-02-2019T18:49:49,BadFoMo,"Her hair in panel 6 makes her look look like May from Ed, Edd, 'n' Eddy."
22-02-2019T18:50:03,BadFoMo,...Just a little.
22-02-2019T18:50:08,unsteddyphoenix,extremely incorrect
22-02-2019T18:50:13,unsteddyphoenix,catgirlsbestgirls
22-02-2019T18:50:34,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-eyeroll: this again
22-02-2019T18:50:46,BadFoMo,Girls: What about us? what do we get?
22-02-2019T18:50:55,SageSaga,being a catgirl does not make one best nor does being a fox girl make them best
22-02-2019T18:51:21,LannAF,^
22-02-2019T18:51:33,LannAF,but foxgirls are best anyways
22-02-2019T18:51:38,SageSaga,"best girl goes beyond cat, fox, dog, wolf, or even elf and human!"
22-02-2019T18:51:41,LannAF,:D
22-02-2019T18:51:44,unsteddyphoenix,lmao
22-02-2019T18:51:49,SageSaga,And there can be more than one best girl
22-02-2019T18:51:56,Rosscoe,So your saying god is a Woman Sage?
22-02-2019T18:51:56,LannAF,has anyone seen Haru go up in the best girl ratings
22-02-2019T18:52:02,Rosscoe,XD
22-02-2019T18:52:05,unsteddyphoenix,Sage your ideology confuses and scares me
22-02-2019T18:52:07,BadFoMo,Who?
22-02-2019T18:52:12,unsteddyphoenix,And that makes me angry
22-02-2019T18:52:15,LannAF,A stray cat from an anime
22-02-2019T18:52:32,LannAF,she's climbing the ranks
22-02-2019T18:52:39,LannAF,soon she will beat the catgirls
22-02-2019T18:52:45,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
22-02-2019T18:52:49,unsteddyphoenix,A cat is fine too?
22-02-2019T18:52:50,LannAF,(don't know if that's true but that's hilarious to me)

22-02-2019T18:53:05,LannAF,did stream end or did Sage crash?
22-02-2019T18:53:08,SageSaga,The rank of Best Girl is not about being the best- it's about being A Best Girl
22-02-2019T18:53:11,RimaDraws,thanks sage
22-02-2019T18:53:15,LannAF,true sage

22-02-2019T18:54:22,LannAF,"also for an arbitrary title people make, it can work however they believe it to BGR."
22-02-2019T18:54:28,Bgrmystr2,never change fomo XD

22-02-2019T18:56:09,LannAF,Or you don't understand people's use of different words and definitions by social standards
22-02-2019T18:56:33,unsteddyphoenix,someone doesnt understand something
22-02-2019T18:56:51,LannAF,do you understand why kids love the taste of cinnamon toast crunch
