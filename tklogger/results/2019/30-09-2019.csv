30-09-2019T11:04:20,Orthonox,Surprised in the change of eyes for Willow.
30-09-2019T11:13:00,Orthonox,I like it.
30-09-2019T11:16:45,AspiringNoodle,"Those eyes say ""NOPE"""
30-09-2019T11:16:54,AspiringNoodle,"But that face says ""Please don't leave me"""
30-09-2019T11:36:05,AspiringNoodle,"Alright, who else is on board with the ""befriend the pretty ghost kitty even though it'll get you killed"" bandwagon? :3"
30-09-2019T12:22:32,Orthonox,I may consider it if she had no friends.

30-09-2019T17:10:25,SpazztasticKiwi,this little boy just came up and slapped my butt
30-09-2019T17:10:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I almost punted a child
30-09-2019T18:06:03,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
30-09-2019T19:20:33,SpazztasticKiwi,anyone that knows cars on
30-09-2019T20:20:46,CrRAR,Did it seem like he was dared to?
30-09-2019T20:20:53,CrRAR,And... what about cars?

30-09-2019T21:27:12,SpazztasticKiwi,my car stalled
30-09-2019T21:27:45,SpazztasticKiwi,I say mine but it‚Äôs my moms but we‚Äôre both listed on it with her listed as the owner
30-09-2019T21:28:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"it‚Äôs two weeks old so far but as it seems now, I have been the only one watching and noticing the oil gauge lowering"
30-09-2019T21:28:55,SpazztasticKiwi,ergo it stalled mid-road as I was driving home from walking
30-09-2019T21:29:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"someone nearby helped me look at it - filled it with some oil we carry in the car, still not cranking"
30-09-2019T21:29:56,SpazztasticKiwi,mom shows with grandma and her car and deciedes to try jumping it
30-09-2019T21:30:59,SpazztasticKiwi,my grandmas car is a kia though and it‚Äôs semi backwards from a normal (American brand made) car and her battery labels are worn
30-09-2019T21:32:24,SpazztasticKiwi,if you don‚Äôt connect a jump correctly you can made the batteries explode; but we‚Äôve done a jump with her car before and I remembered that her battery‚Äôs positive/negative is backwards from our layout. I took out her car manual as proof and just in case
30-09-2019T21:32:56,SpazztasticKiwi,"lo and behold, I remembered right but nooooooo - my mother wants to call the cops and have them do it now"
30-09-2019T21:33:35,SpazztasticKiwi,"long story short on that they came out after a hot minute of waiting, fiddle with it, it still don‚Äôt start, and then fiddle with the fuses"
30-09-2019T21:34:23,SpazztasticKiwi,they think it‚Äôs a sensor chip gone wrong - I used a friends car and went tf home - not like I was being heard to begin with
30-09-2019T21:34:40,SpazztasticKiwi,if anyone has ideas I‚Äôm all fukin ears
