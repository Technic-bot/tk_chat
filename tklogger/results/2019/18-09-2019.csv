18-09-2019T01:40:08,AspiringNoodle,I'm in a pretty good mood
18-09-2019T01:40:12,AspiringNoodle,Fixed some corrupt OS files
18-09-2019T01:40:16,AspiringNoodle,Got the front mic port working
18-09-2019T01:40:43,AspiringNoodle,"Miss my old tower though, opaque top, could just put my headset on top"
18-09-2019T01:40:51,AspiringNoodle,"Got tempered glass on top this time, don't wanna scratch it :c"
18-09-2019T04:36:41,TeapotOfDoom,U

18-09-2019T04:37:26,TeapotOfDoom,I wanna see you scratching tempered glass by laying a headset ontop of it
18-09-2019T06:41:05,SomeNiceUser,I decided to restore my laptop to factory default.
18-09-2019T06:41:51,SomeNiceUser,It’s not much of a big deal so far.
18-09-2019T06:42:15,SomeNiceUser,Since I did not have much information on it to begin with.
18-09-2019T06:42:49,SomeNiceUser,Except for my steam.
18-09-2019T06:43:19,SomeNiceUser,I should really do a few backups next time.
18-09-2019T06:44:50,SomeNiceUser,"This time, I will not touch anything that I don’t know."

18-09-2019T09:07:17,SomeNiceUser,I made it even worse.
18-09-2019T09:07:41,SomeNiceUser,"I sure do ruin everything I touch, do I..?"
18-09-2019T09:08:24,SomeNiceUser,Time to clean install windows 10...
18-09-2019T09:08:34,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
18-09-2019T09:09:01,SomeNiceUser,At least the hardware lock is gone...
18-09-2019T09:09:24,SomeNiceUser,Now it does not connect wirelessly.
18-09-2019T09:09:53,SomeNiceUser,It’s one problem after another lol
18-09-2019T09:12:34,SomeNiceUser,Today I learned to not fix something that is not broken.
18-09-2019T09:12:50,SomeNiceUser,:ptv-kippi:
18-09-2019T09:32:48,SomeNiceUser,But I got lots of time to fix my laptop.
18-09-2019T09:39:33,SomeNiceUser,"To be honest, I’m not sad or angry. But I can just chuckle because it’s my fault in the first place. But I’m going to get it working again!"
18-09-2019T09:40:38,SomeNiceUser,"Also, how is your day everyone?"
18-09-2019T09:40:57,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-katwet:
18-09-2019T09:42:21,SomeNiceUser,That’s good to hear Terra.
18-09-2019T09:53:11,SomeNiceUser,The entire time I was using the wrong password...
18-09-2019T09:53:23,SomeNiceUser,:ptv-uneasy:
18-09-2019T09:57:35,SomeNiceUser,I was looking way too far.
18-09-2019T09:57:43,SomeNiceUser,Oh we
18-09-2019T09:57:51,SomeNiceUser,Well*
18-09-2019T09:58:14,SomeNiceUser,I should draw about this incident.
18-09-2019T10:00:14,ThingsAreMoving,:ctwokinds-nibsbounce:
18-09-2019T10:00:27,SomeNiceUser,Hi things!
18-09-2019T10:00:33,ThingsAreMoving,yo
18-09-2019T10:00:47,ThingsAreMoving,does anyone know if there's going to be a sunday stream this week?
18-09-2019T10:01:16,ThingsAreMoving,"or is it uncertain, cause of the Expo thingy?"
18-09-2019T10:04:19,TerraTheWizard,i've been assuming no
18-09-2019T10:04:33,SomeNiceUser,"I’m uncertain, but maybe Tom will stream earlier like two months age."
18-09-2019T10:04:47,SomeNiceUser,ago*
18-09-2019T10:07:00,SomeNiceUser,I’m happy about my laptop working again.
18-09-2019T10:11:54,ThingsAreMoving,"welp, gotta wait and see i guess. congrats on getting your laptop to work. Here's a celebrating squirrel for you :ctwokinds-nibsbdaydance:"
18-09-2019T10:12:13,SomeNiceUser,Thank you Things!
18-09-2019T10:27:58,TeapotOfDoom,:ctwokinds-nibsbdaydance:
18-09-2019T11:19:30,Dadrobit,"In my experience, full disk wipes on new laptops are justshort of absolutely neccessary."
18-09-2019T11:19:59,TeapotOfDoom,With the amount of bloatware on them these days i definitely agree
18-09-2019T11:20:49,Dadrobit,"Got a Dell Inspiron a few months ago, very fine laptop by all standards, but Dell puts soooo much damn bloatware that when I totally deleted that partition, it saw some serious gains in general performance. Especially at idle and especially on RAM."
18-09-2019T11:21:34,Dadrobit,And I still got the benefits of the software package by simply redeeming them right before the wipe and backing that information up.
18-09-2019T11:23:52,Dadrobit,Did have to RMA the first one though. Dead pixel in the middle of the screen and it bsod on me several times almost immediately.

18-09-2019T12:08:29,TerraTheWizard,why are there so many people rp'ing as characters in the patreon comments recently
18-09-2019T12:14:02,ThingsAreMoving,Dunno. I find public RP'ing cringy af.
18-09-2019T12:14:36,TerraTheWizard,also just noticed nibs in the picnic basket :stuffed_flatbread::ctwokinds-nibsbounce:
18-09-2019T12:50:36,AspiringNoodle,"Mike totally has a ""I can die happy right now"" expression :ptv-hearts:"
18-09-2019T12:50:40,FloofyCat,I haven't seen anyone RPing
18-09-2019T12:50:50,FloofyCat,Pffft
18-09-2019T12:50:53,FloofyCat,He does indeed.
18-09-2019T12:52:06,FloofyCat,"I bet Keidran sexuality isn't just male/female/both and includes species as well. Because Mike and Evals never were attracted to Kat, I wonder if Evals just wants other dogs and Mike wants other Foxes."
18-09-2019T12:53:03,FloofyCat,"Or they were attracted to Kat but Kat was out of bounds being Eric's favourite and all. I dunno, I think Tom said they weren't interested in Kat but don't quote me on that."
18-09-2019T13:02:03,AspiringNoodle,"I wouldn't be surprised if while slaves there was a whole ""touch Kat and you die"" type deal going on"

18-09-2019T13:22:49,AspiringNoodle,Who could resist Kat?  She's bootyful
18-09-2019T13:22:59,AspiringNoodle,"Though, I guess Flora would have something to say about that :ptv-snicker:"
