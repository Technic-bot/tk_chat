02-09-2019T02:56:16,AspiringNoodle,Good luck!
02-09-2019T02:56:36,AspiringNoodle,It has to be more pleasant than dull pain behind the eyes / dull forehead headache
02-09-2019T05:23:30,TerraTheWizard,and that's done
02-09-2019T05:23:34,TerraTheWizard,think it went ok

02-09-2019T11:07:37,CrimsonQuill,Noodle
02-09-2019T11:07:41,CrimsonQuill,What's wrong?
02-09-2019T11:10:47,AspiringNoodle,This illness is just one giant joke
02-09-2019T11:11:35,AspiringNoodle,Still haven't gotten my voice back.  And earlier I had coughing fits so strong that they caused me to vomit
02-09-2019T11:11:47,AspiringNoodle,And then I vomited so strongly that I got a nose bleed :/
02-09-2019T11:13:26,CrimsonQuill,Oh...that is very unpleasant.
02-09-2019T11:13:40,CrimsonQuill,Does ginger-lemon and honey tea help?
02-09-2019T11:13:43,CrimsonQuill,Or try camomile
02-09-2019T11:13:46,CrimsonQuill,Maybe
02-09-2019T11:54:37,SniperJackal,What kind of illness is that
02-09-2019T11:54:45,SniperJackal,sounds horrible
02-09-2019T12:39:27,Mikemkke034,Hey
02-09-2019T13:27:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"my mom likes the peach sprite & usually gets it at this one burger king; this mcdonalds nearby that we’d already stopped at though, I noticed, had the same machine"
02-09-2019T13:28:00,SpazztasticKiwi,so I ask to make sure what I’m lookin at is the right flavor and offer to get it for her
02-09-2019T13:28:11,SpazztasticKiwi,nah she gotta go in and look and get it herself
02-09-2019T13:28:18,CrimsonQuill,Hullo Spazztastic
02-09-2019T13:28:18,SpazztasticKiwi,like I can’t read
02-09-2019T13:35:56,SomeNiceUser,Hi everyone!
02-09-2019T13:36:05,CrimsonQuill,hullo
02-09-2019T13:36:23,SomeNiceUser,"Hi Quill, how was your day?"
02-09-2019T13:38:06,CrimsonQuill,Fairly uneventful.
02-09-2019T13:38:31,CrimsonQuill,"I took care of some chores, rotted my brain on Youtube and TV Tropes and worked on my Norman Tower House in Minecraft,"
02-09-2019T13:38:48,CrimsonQuill,I also made Spaghetti Bolognese hile listening to 'Bonetrousle' on a loop.
02-09-2019T13:38:55,SomeNiceUser,Nice.
02-09-2019T13:40:32,SomeNiceUser,"Mine was pretty good, I helped my uncle with a godaddy website."
02-09-2019T13:40:54,CrimsonQuill,"Oh, that's good. :) I saw adverts for that ste."
02-09-2019T13:40:56,CrimsonQuill,site.
02-09-2019T13:42:11,SomeNiceUser,Got a 100$ bill in a few hours.
02-09-2019T13:42:33,SomeNiceUser,‘Twas a good pay.
02-09-2019T13:42:42,CrimsonQuill,cool.
02-09-2019T13:51:19,SomeNiceUser,But now chores must be done.
02-09-2019T13:51:28,AspiringNoodle,"Hmmm, I don't feel like absolute shite now"
02-09-2019T13:51:35,AspiringNoodle,I like it :ptv-hearts:
02-09-2019T13:51:39,SomeNiceUser,Oh hai noodle
02-09-2019T13:51:54,CrimsonQuill,Feeling better Noodle/
02-09-2019T13:52:03,AspiringNoodle,"Yup, voice is still pretty gone, though"
02-09-2019T13:52:08,SomeNiceUser,That’s great noodle!
02-09-2019T13:52:31,SomeNiceUser,Now you can do some nice asmr.
02-09-2019T13:52:55,AspiringNoodle,"So the doctor gave a note clearing me for regular activity as of tomorrow, and it's no problem since tomorrow's a day I was scheduled off for"
02-09-2019T13:52:55,SomeNiceUser,Lol
02-09-2019T13:53:12,SomeNiceUser,That’s also good.
02-09-2019T13:53:38,SomeNiceUser,Tomorrow is the day where I get my new laptop.
02-09-2019T13:53:39,AspiringNoodle,"But I question if I'll even be ready for thursday at this rate.  My throat's feeling so much better, but if I can't speak, I can't really do my job :p"
02-09-2019T13:54:15,CrimsonQuill,Oh
02-09-2019T13:54:16,CrimsonQuill,Crumbs
02-09-2019T13:54:19,SomeNiceUser,That sucks.
02-09-2019T13:55:40,AspiringNoodle,"'tis the life of a gas station cashier, ohohoho"
02-09-2019T13:56:04,AspiringNoodle,"Also, the episode earlier today may have been my own damn fault :c"
02-09-2019T13:56:11,AspiringNoodle,antibiotics + milk do not mix
02-09-2019T13:56:25,SomeNiceUser,What happened?
02-09-2019T13:56:29,CrimsonQuill,Bleeeurgh
02-09-2019T13:56:41,SomeNiceUser,Oh.
02-09-2019T13:56:57,SomeNiceUser,Rip milk

02-09-2019T14:01:28,CrimsonQuill,Which one is page 352?
02-09-2019T14:02:27,AspiringNoodle,Naked Natani shenanigans with Keith
02-09-2019T14:03:19,CrimsonQuill,ok
02-09-2019T14:04:23,AspiringNoodle,"I'm a little fuzy on the characteristics, but it should be around the time Natani goes into heat and is trying to hide it, but Keith recognizes that Natani's going through it"
02-09-2019T14:04:38,AspiringNoodle,And he tries to help cover for her
02-09-2019T14:08:56,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-KeithNeat:
02-09-2019T14:09:22,SomeNiceUser,I guess so.
02-09-2019T14:31:43,AspiringNoodle,"Awesome, both the game codes I got for my gpu bundle were good xD"
02-09-2019T14:31:57,AspiringNoodle,"Tbh, I didn't really care if I got the games or not, they would just be icing on the cake"
02-09-2019T14:32:31,SomeNiceUser,Control and wolfeinstein?
02-09-2019T14:32:36,Mikemkke034,I finished watching the MHA movie
02-09-2019T14:32:44,AspiringNoodle,You got it SNU :3
02-09-2019T14:33:00,Mikemkke034,"Hey Noodle, hey SNU"
02-09-2019T14:33:11,SomeNiceUser,"Hey mike,"
02-09-2019T14:33:47,Mikemkke034,How goes it
02-09-2019T14:34:08,CrimsonQuill,yawns slightly
02-09-2019T14:34:10,AspiringNoodle,"Downsides of both codes: Control is only on EGS, Wolfenstein only on Bethesda.net, game itself is bad xD"
02-09-2019T14:34:19,SomeNiceUser,"I’m just waiting for my laptop, which comes in about a day."
02-09-2019T14:34:40,Mikemkke034,Hey Crim
02-09-2019T14:34:54,Mikemkke034,I'm waiting on this hurricane to pass...
02-09-2019T14:35:03,SomeNiceUser,That is just sad. Both games on two different platforms.
02-09-2019T14:35:04,CrimsonQuill,I saw videos on BBC news.
02-09-2019T14:35:17,AspiringNoodle,I saw it coming a long time ago
02-09-2019T14:35:18,CrimsonQuill,Has it hit you badly
02-09-2019T14:35:40,AspiringNoodle,"For example, I have Rainbow Six Siege on Uplay (got it for free when I got my 970 long ago)"
02-09-2019T14:35:40,Mikemkke034,"It has yet to hit me, but it's coming"
02-09-2019T14:35:42,SomeNiceUser,I’m just oblivious to the hurricane.
02-09-2019T14:35:59,SomeNiceUser,So be safe Mike.
02-09-2019T14:36:02,AspiringNoodle,^
02-09-2019T14:36:14,AspiringNoodle,"Be safe, and hopefully in the future there will be an aggregate platform"
02-09-2019T14:36:39,CrimsonQuill,I hope that Tom will pop by sometime this week.
02-09-2019T14:36:43,AspiringNoodle,I think plenty of people would be willing to pay a small fee (monthly) if it meant they had ONE platform that could aggregate everything
02-09-2019T14:36:54,CrimsonQuill,I need to ask him a question of personal importance.
02-09-2019T14:38:27,Mikemkke034,Lol
02-09-2019T14:48:22,CrimsonQuill,BTW
02-09-2019T14:48:34,CrimsonQuill,My friend and I were talking about Undertale and Deltarune
02-09-2019T14:48:59,CrimsonQuill,And he sent me a strip that looked like one of Tom's fanarts
02-09-2019T14:49:10,CrimsonQuill,But I can't find it anywhere-the source
02-09-2019T14:49:19,TerraTheWizard,hm?
02-09-2019T14:49:24,TerraTheWizard,what's in the art?
02-09-2019T14:49:31,CrimsonQuill,I'll whisper it Terra
02-09-2019T14:49:33,CrimsonQuill,But first
02-09-2019T14:49:35,TerraTheWizard,kay
02-09-2019T14:49:51,CrimsonQuill,"Just to make sure, it won't be a spoiler, will it?"
02-09-2019T14:50:01,CrimsonQuill,I want to make sure you already know the context
02-09-2019T14:50:06,Mikemkke034,Send it to me as well crim
02-09-2019T14:50:08,TerraTheWizard,i've played both undertale and deltarune through like 4 times each
02-09-2019T14:50:15,CrimsonQuill,Oh
02-09-2019T14:50:33,CrimsonQuill,"I played Undertale twice-once Pacifist, the next Pacifist golden ending"
02-09-2019T14:50:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom may be blissfully working in the empty house he has to himself rn
02-09-2019T14:50:56,TerraTheWizard,"yeah, i've only done the pacifist/truepacifist runs"
02-09-2019T14:51:03,CrimsonQuill,This little beauty
02-09-2019T14:51:06,TerraTheWizard,404
02-09-2019T14:51:11,Mikemkke034,^
02-09-2019T14:51:16,CrimsonQuill,Oh C'MON!
02-09-2019T14:51:28,Mikemkke034,Lol
02-09-2019T14:51:45,Mikemkke034,I'm just watching m keyboard act as a sound visualiser
02-09-2019T14:51:48,Mikemkke034,my*
02-09-2019T14:52:20,TerraTheWizard,>fbcdn
02-09-2019T14:52:29,CrimsonQuill,Does it still not work?
02-09-2019T14:52:32,TerraTheWizard,is this from a facebook pm?
02-09-2019T14:52:35,CrimsonQuill,Yeah
02-09-2019T14:52:39,TerraTheWizard,because it will never work then
02-09-2019T14:52:41,CrimsonQuill,He sent it on Messenger
02-09-2019T14:52:43,Mikemkke034,Oof
02-09-2019T14:52:46,CrimsonQuill,"Oh, for the love of GOD"
02-09-2019T14:52:56,TerraTheWizard,"it's in an encrypted chat, lol"
02-09-2019T14:52:57,CrimsonQuill,detonates violently
02-09-2019T14:53:10,CrimsonQuill,How the blazes can I share it then?
02-09-2019T14:53:17,TerraTheWizard,upload it to imgur
02-09-2019T14:53:19,CrimsonQuill,Urrgh....
02-09-2019T14:53:19,Mikemkke034,Imgur or Discord image
02-09-2019T14:53:25,CrimsonQuill,I don't have an imgur account
02-09-2019T14:53:30,TerraTheWizard,you don't need one
02-09-2019T14:53:34,CrimsonQuill,Oh
02-09-2019T14:53:44,TerraTheWizard,only need an account if you want to keep it private
02-09-2019T14:54:01,TerraTheWizard,you can upload public images without one
02-09-2019T14:54:08,CrimsonQuill,I see
02-09-2019T14:54:12,CrimsonQuill,I'm uploading now
02-09-2019T14:54:24,Mikemkke034,Awesome

02-09-2019T14:57:36,A1kash,Мне можно по русски писать или лучше по английски?
02-09-2019T14:57:37,Mikemkke034,It does
02-09-2019T14:57:46,CrimsonQuill,Any idea where to find it?
02-09-2019T14:58:00,TerraTheWizard,https://old.reddit.com/r/Undertale/comments/3ry8wa/spoilers_behind_you/
02-09-2019T14:58:09,Mikemkke034,That's amusing
02-09-2019T14:58:32,CrimsonQuill,Awwww
02-09-2019T14:58:38,CrimsonQuill,I wondered where he'd posted it
02-09-2019T14:58:46,CrimsonQuill,"Also, Tom has a Reddit? Never knew."
02-09-2019T14:59:00,TerraTheWizard,he pops into r/twokinds now ad then
02-09-2019T14:59:03,TerraTheWizard,*and

02-09-2019T14:59:27,TerraTheWizard,no problemo
02-09-2019T15:03:32,SomeNiceUser,Nice.
02-09-2019T15:04:06,A1kash,А кто то русских встречал кроме меня?
02-09-2019T15:04:31,Mikemkke034,No
02-09-2019T15:04:39,Mikemkke034,"At least, not that I know of"
02-09-2019T15:04:49,CrimsonQuill,"Just reading through Tom's reddits now...He calculated, two years ago, how long it'd take to redraw the old pages of the comic at 3.25 years with 10 hours per page."
02-09-2019T15:05:03,Mikemkke034,Wow
02-09-2019T15:05:35,Mikemkke034,I'm needing something to watch. Any suggestions?
02-09-2019T15:05:48,AspiringNoodle,"Anime, Netflix, anything specific?"
02-09-2019T15:05:49,CrimsonQuill,Can it be anything anything?
02-09-2019T15:05:52,CrimsonQuill,Youtube?
02-09-2019T15:05:59,Mikemkke034,Hulu Youtube or movies
02-09-2019T15:06:06,Mikemkke034,I don't use Netflix anymore
02-09-2019T15:06:23,CrimsonQuill,Because the first thing I recommend is 'Caboose visits the Halo Reach Campaign' off the top of my head.
02-09-2019T15:06:30,Mikemkke034,But I'm currently listening to a Kawaii EDM music mix
02-09-2019T15:06:44,Mikemkke034,I'll check that out
02-09-2019T15:06:48,CrimsonQuill,Or 'I AM AN EMOTIONAL TIME BOMB' animation

02-09-2019T15:07:21,CrimsonQuill,SovietWomble playing Alien Isolation
02-09-2019T15:07:43,CrimsonQuill,"Take Markiplier's jumpscare reaction...and then imagine someone who is ten times as scared,"
02-09-2019T15:07:44,AspiringNoodle,"Hmmm, I recommend Piemations on Youtube"
02-09-2019T15:07:46,CrimsonQuill,So those three videos
02-09-2019T15:07:51,AspiringNoodle,Dude's hilarious
02-09-2019T15:07:54,AspiringNoodle,Same with ScottFalco
02-09-2019T15:08:14,CrimsonQuill,Be right back
02-09-2019T15:08:20,Mikemkke034,Ok
02-09-2019T15:08:33,Mikemkke034,This is the link to that mix im listening to...
02-09-2019T15:08:34,Mikemkke034,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN04a48Ba9I
02-09-2019T15:08:42,Mikemkke034,It's the Kawaii EDM
02-09-2019T15:09:12,CrimsonQuill,Oh interesting
02-09-2019T15:09:16,Mikemkke034,Yes
02-09-2019T15:09:21,CrimsonQuill,So recap

02-09-2019T15:09:40,Mikemkke034,Already watched Emotional Timebomb
02-09-2019T15:09:44,CrimsonQuill,How was it?
02-09-2019T15:09:47,Mikemkke034,and Next is SovietWomble

02-09-2019T15:10:07,CrimsonQuill,My sister loves Emotional Time Bomb
02-09-2019T15:10:10,Mikemkke034,Lol
02-09-2019T15:10:16,CrimsonQuill,'Jesus Christ'
02-09-2019T15:13:04,Mikemkke034,Now I'm watching Soviet
02-09-2019T15:13:40,CrimsonQuill,I want to give Caboose a hug every time
02-09-2019T15:13:45,Mikemkke034,Yes
02-09-2019T15:13:47,CrimsonQuill,The thing is
02-09-2019T15:14:14,CrimsonQuill,I never knew about RvB until I looked at the 'Conveniently timed guard' page on Tv Tropes
02-09-2019T15:14:24,CrimsonQuill,It had a scene from it as the image and I thought it was Halo
02-09-2019T15:14:29,CrimsonQuill,I was almost right

02-09-2019T15:18:59,CrimsonQuill,I just hide behind the letsplays
02-09-2019T15:19:13,Mikemkke034,I don't play many horror games regardles
02-09-2019T15:32:38,CrimsonQuill,"How was it, if it's finished?"

02-09-2019T17:05:22,CrimsonQuill,'Blush Blush'>
02-09-2019T17:05:34,CrimsonQuill,I'm scared to ask what that entails.

02-09-2019T17:05:34,TeapotOfDoom,Please don't ask

02-09-2019T17:05:49,Mikemkke034,Neither will I
02-09-2019T17:05:51,CrimsonQuill,I had a nice time on Youtube though
02-09-2019T17:06:01,Mikemkke034,I have some modded minecraft tinkering to do

02-09-2019T17:06:30,TeapotOfDoom,But i have do say the video was extremely entertaining xD
02-09-2019T17:06:56,CrimsonQuill,And Mark's been on Podcast with Burnie Burns (Church and Lopez) and Gustavo Surola (Simmons)
02-09-2019T17:07:08,CrimsonQuill,"Ah, the meeting of internet creators!"

02-09-2019T17:08:48,TeapotOfDoom,Also the please dont ask was referring to why i d watch a two hour video of mark playing a furry dating sim
02-09-2019T17:09:29,TeapotOfDoom,He happens to be in the game. And he wanted to find out if that was true
02-09-2019T17:10:07,TeapotOfDoom,It was hillarious tbh
02-09-2019T17:10:34,TeapotOfDoom,And now i will proceed to bed

02-09-2019T17:17:35,CrimsonQuill,"@SomeNiceUser It's Raine and Red having a heartwarming kiss under a waterfall, in their halfkind forms."
02-09-2019T17:17:46,Mikemkke034,Ah
02-09-2019T17:17:51,SomeNiceUser,That’s pretty sweet.
02-09-2019T17:17:54,CrimsonQuill,Kind of like that 'Rainshower' picture with Tiger Trace and Flora
02-09-2019T17:18:03,CrimsonQuill,Something sweet and wholesome like that
02-09-2019T17:18:22,SomeNiceUser,"Yeah, it is."
02-09-2019T17:18:46,CrimsonQuill,:)
02-09-2019T17:19:29,Mikemkke034,I did Natani teaching Kat how to magic
02-09-2019T17:20:04,CrimsonQuill,Oh
02-09-2019T17:20:07,Mikemkke034,Yeah
02-09-2019T17:20:08,CrimsonQuill,That'd be fun to see
02-09-2019T17:20:18,CrimsonQuill,But I think we've seen a sketch like that already
02-09-2019T17:20:25,Mikemkke034,"Last week, I suggested the same thing, and was the 2nd lowest vote"
02-09-2019T17:20:27,CrimsonQuill,Where she tried to get her to do a spell
02-09-2019T17:20:39,CrimsonQuill,And...it backfired. Horribly.

02-09-2019T17:21:27,SomeNiceUser,Hi Tom.
02-09-2019T17:21:29,CrimsonQuill,Nice to see you
02-09-2019T17:21:37,Mikemkke034,I never knew that. So I see why now
02-09-2019T17:21:52,CrimsonQuill,"Also, thanks for linking it-I was afraid that I'd have to trawl through suggestions"
02-09-2019T17:21:58,Twokinds,"To be fair, it's a very early sketch."
02-09-2019T17:22:12,Mikemkke034,Probably why I never saw it
02-09-2019T17:22:46,SomeNiceUser,"I do remember seeing that sketch, and it getting coloured."
02-09-2019T17:23:00,Mikemkke034,It got coloured?
02-09-2019T17:23:02,Mikemkke034,One sec
02-09-2019T17:23:27,SomeNiceUser,"The first part, and the second one."
02-09-2019T17:25:06,Twokinds,A good way to check is to use https://twokinds.gallery
02-09-2019T17:25:16,TerraTheWizard,i struggled to come up with a new sketch idea
02-09-2019T17:25:21,TerraTheWizard,scrapped most of my saved ones
02-09-2019T17:25:32,Twokinds,You can use the plus signs next to character names to crossreference them and see every sketch with those characters
02-09-2019T17:25:51,SomeNiceUser,Need a idea Terra? I got some.
02-09-2019T17:25:54,TerraTheWizard,that site is super useful
02-09-2019T17:25:59,TerraTheWizard,"nah, i got an idea"
02-09-2019T17:26:03,CrimsonQuill,I didn't know you could cross reference them like that.
02-09-2019T17:26:04,TerraTheWizard,"went with ""Hipster Natani."""
02-09-2019T17:26:07,CrimsonQuill,By the way Tom...
02-09-2019T17:26:12,TerraTheWizard,becaue it's a simple silly one
02-09-2019T17:26:33,CrimsonQuill,My friend sent me some of your Undertale Fanart on Messenger while we were talking about video games
02-09-2019T17:26:41,CrimsonQuill,And Terra located your Reddit
02-09-2019T17:26:45,CrimsonQuill,It's adorable
02-09-2019T17:26:46,CrimsonQuill,:)
02-09-2019T17:26:51,SomeNiceUser,I was thinking about a transformation mishap.
02-09-2019T17:26:58,Mikemkke034,Much thanks Tom
02-09-2019T17:28:55,CrimsonQuill,Actually Tom
02-09-2019T17:29:02,CrimsonQuill,That reminds me
02-09-2019T17:29:17,CrimsonQuill,Remember that...Halo thing that had Raine in it I posted a bit ago?
02-09-2019T17:30:00,TerraTheWizard,"(just finish your statement rather than waiting for a response, chats work better that way)"
02-09-2019T17:30:08,CrimsonQuill,Oh
02-09-2019T17:30:11,CrimsonQuill,Just...
02-09-2019T17:30:20,CrimsonQuill,I always feel nervous asking my silly questions
02-09-2019T17:30:56,TerraTheWizard,just doot it
02-09-2019T17:30:59,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-nibsbounce:
02-09-2019T17:31:00,CrimsonQuill,It's just that I like to have a green light before I assault every one with text
02-09-2019T17:31:16,CrimsonQuill,Especially the creator of the whole comic
02-09-2019T17:32:02,CrimsonQuill,...
02-09-2019T17:32:03,CrimsonQuill,Sorry
02-09-2019T17:32:09,CrimsonQuill,Ok
02-09-2019T17:32:10,CrimsonQuill,Tom
02-09-2019T17:32:18,CrimsonQuill,I've probably asked something like this before...
02-09-2019T17:32:30,CrimsonQuill,But recently I've started work on a Halo fancomic
02-09-2019T17:32:51,CrimsonQuill,"I've even made my first reference sheet, I'll link it if I'm allowed"
02-09-2019T17:33:02,CrimsonQuill,And the idea is a three-person fireteam
02-09-2019T17:33:12,CrimsonQuill,In Postwar operations from UNSC Infinity
02-09-2019T17:33:17,CrimsonQuill,"Now I have two OCs,"
02-09-2019T17:33:35,CrimsonQuill,But I also created a backstory for the Halo version of Raine you drew in December
02-09-2019T17:33:40,CrimsonQuill,ANd a possible character arc
02-09-2019T17:33:51,CrimsonQuill,"From ODST to Spartan, and all that"
02-09-2019T17:33:51,SomeNiceUser,Seems interesting.
02-09-2019T17:34:03,CrimsonQuill,"My main worry is, well, Raine Silverlock is your character."
02-09-2019T17:34:20,CrimsonQuill,So...I;m not sure whether I should put her in the story or not.
02-09-2019T17:34:29,CrimsonQuill,"I want to, but I'm afraid I might mess it up."
02-09-2019T17:34:44,CrimsonQuill,And my other characters have a lot of development leaning on teamwork and suchlike
02-09-2019T17:35:10,CrimsonQuill,"Just...anything, anything at all you could say would help."
02-09-2019T17:36:03,CrimsonQuill,Because I really don't feel like I should include her unless it's ok with you. That's pretty much everything.
02-09-2019T17:36:24,CrimsonQuill,"Sorry for so much text, just had to get it out there. I'll shut up for a bit and wait."
02-09-2019T17:39:57,SomeNiceUser,Could be plausible as fanfiction.
02-09-2019T17:40:23,CrimsonQuill,"@SomeNiceUser that's the idea, it's a Halo Fanon with a Twokinds Character"
02-09-2019T17:40:36,SomeNiceUser,Yup.

02-09-2019T17:53:56,CrimsonQuill,I think I might have broken Tom again.
02-09-2019T17:54:17,SomeNiceUser,Night Terra.
02-09-2019T17:56:47,CrimsonQuill,...or just typed too much...
02-09-2019T17:57:49,SomeNiceUser,"You broke Tom, again?"
02-09-2019T17:58:21,CrimsonQuill,I talk too much...
02-09-2019T17:59:43,SomeNiceUser,"It’s fine, the idea you discussed is interesting."
02-09-2019T18:00:03,CrimsonQuill,"But the thing is, I want to know if Tom's ok with it"
02-09-2019T18:00:50,SomeNiceUser,That’s something that we’ll never know.
02-09-2019T18:01:15,CrimsonQuill,Oh. Why will we never know?
02-09-2019T18:03:20,SomeNiceUser,"I dunno, maybe you’ll get a answer, or not."
02-09-2019T18:12:51,CrimsonQuill,Well...I'll wait for one all night if I must
02-09-2019T18:13:41,SomeNiceUser,Now that’s dedication.
02-09-2019T18:18:28,CrimsonQuill,"I just want to know whether it's ok to write Raine into a Halo fancomic or not, that's all."
02-09-2019T18:29:14,CrRAR,Is it like a cameo type appearance or long term? Tom usually is okay with fanart type stuff.
02-09-2019T18:30:17,CrimsonQuill,It'd be long term
02-09-2019T18:30:20,CrimsonQuill,Also
02-09-2019T18:30:24,CrimsonQuill,Hello CrRAR
02-09-2019T18:30:42,CrimsonQuill,My idea is for her to be the third member of the fireteam
02-09-2019T18:31:49,CrRAR,Ah I see
02-09-2019T18:32:05,CrimsonQuill,A very long term thing
02-09-2019T18:32:15,CrimsonQuill,She'd be a tritagonist

02-09-2019T18:42:54,AspiringNoodle,"It will probably be along the lines of: ""As long as you aren't doing this to make money, I'm okay with it."""

02-09-2019T19:20:51,Mikemkke034,"Brb, gotta clean up from dinner"
02-09-2019T19:27:31,IronHorseComics,and there's my sketch suggestion
02-09-2019T19:27:47,SomeNiceUser,What is it Horse?
02-09-2019T19:27:54,SomeNiceUser,I’m curious.
02-09-2019T19:28:34,SomeNiceUser,What are you suggesting this week?
02-09-2019T19:28:45,Mikemkke034,Back
02-09-2019T19:28:57,SomeNiceUser,Hi Mike.
02-09-2019T19:31:03,Mikemkke034,Hey
02-09-2019T19:37:04,SomeNiceUser,"I got so many ideas for suggestions, but so little money, ‘‘tis the life of living within your budget."
02-09-2019T19:37:21,SomeNiceUser,And I’m fine with it.
02-09-2019T19:37:44,CrimsonQuill,I am a fool who has a budget but makes suggestions anyway.
02-09-2019T19:37:51,SomeNiceUser,Lol
02-09-2019T19:38:03,Mikemkke034,Not I
02-09-2019T19:40:26,SomeNiceUser,"The thing I noticed that in all the sketches, there is no female gender swapped yet."
02-09-2019T19:40:59,CrimsonQuill,Weeelll...there is one.
02-09-2019T19:41:08,SomeNiceUser,?
02-09-2019T19:41:18,CrimsonQuill,There's a sketch with male Laura.
02-09-2019T19:41:27,Mikemkke034,Oh yeah
02-09-2019T19:41:31,SomeNiceUser,Ah yeah that one.
02-09-2019T19:41:32,CrimsonQuill,Check the gallery
02-09-2019T19:41:43,CrimsonQuill,Other than that...yeah. Fanservice.
02-09-2019T19:41:43,SomeNiceUser,Surfer Laura.
02-09-2019T19:43:09,SomeNiceUser,I was thinking male Raine with female Red shy with their altered bodies.
02-09-2019T19:43:26,SomeNiceUser,Just a weird idea.
02-09-2019T19:43:29,Mikemkke034,Hmm
02-09-2019T19:43:44,CrimsonQuill,Ummmm
02-09-2019T19:43:48,CrimsonQuill,I'd rather not that one
02-09-2019T19:43:57,CrimsonQuill,Not with Raine
02-09-2019T19:44:44,SomeNiceUser,Of course. It’s just a thought that popped in the back of my head.
02-09-2019T19:45:10,Mikemkke034,Never hurts to say what you're thinking. Unless it is intended to harm someone else
02-09-2019T19:48:12,SomeNiceUser,"Still, the person who does suggest that is a madlad."
02-09-2019T19:48:25,Mikemkke034,Yeah
02-09-2019T19:48:30,Mikemkke034,That's why we are here
02-09-2019T19:48:34,Mikemkke034,On this chat
02-09-2019T19:55:01,SomeNiceUser,I’m probably gonna suggest that later this year.
02-09-2019T19:57:50,Mikemkke034,Okay
02-09-2019T19:58:40,CrimsonQuill,"I'll be brutally honest, that isn't something I'd like to see."
02-09-2019T20:03:01,Mikemkke034,Whelp
02-09-2019T20:03:11,Mikemkke034,Anything you guys want to talk about?
02-09-2019T20:03:28,CrimsonQuill,"Weellll, when do you think Tom'll be back?"
02-09-2019T20:03:32,CrimsonQuill,Or Halo...
02-09-2019T20:03:43,CrimsonQuill,Or Terry Pratchett
02-09-2019T20:03:57,Mikemkke034,I'm sure Tom'll be back later
02-09-2019T20:04:09,CrimsonQuill,Hope so
02-09-2019T20:04:12,Mikemkke034,"I mean, he DOES have a life outside of TK and us"
02-09-2019T20:04:24,CrimsonQuill,Because I'm not sure how long I can stay awake
02-09-2019T20:04:57,Mikemkke034,"Well, if you miss him, you could always ask near a stream or something"
02-09-2019T20:05:09,CrimsonQuill,The thing is
02-09-2019T20:05:18,CrimsonQuill,I asked him just when he was in the chat
02-09-2019T20:05:24,Mikemkke034,I know
02-09-2019T20:05:30,CrimsonQuill,And I think I might have just...overdone it
02-09-2019T20:05:35,CrimsonQuill,Maybe he's thinking it over
02-09-2019T20:05:39,Mikemkke034,Maybe
02-09-2019T20:05:40,CrimsonQuill,I don't know
02-09-2019T20:05:46,Mikemkke034,Just give is some time
02-09-2019T20:05:50,Mikemkke034,Don't stress yourself
02-09-2019T20:05:58,CrimsonQuill,stresses themself
02-09-2019T20:06:27,IronHorseComics,is too tired to be stressed
02-09-2019T20:06:44,Mikemkke034,offers a drink to Crimson and Iron
02-09-2019T20:06:56,IronHorseComics,"nooooo, I gotta go to work in the morning"
02-09-2019T20:07:06,CrimsonQuill,What sort of Drink? Tea or squash?
02-09-2019T20:07:15,Mikemkke034,"Just a ""drink"""
02-09-2019T20:07:20,Mikemkke034,Your choice
02-09-2019T20:07:24,CrimsonQuill,:)
02-09-2019T20:07:31,Mikemkke034,Lol

02-09-2019T20:10:40,CrRAR,"Have HaloRaine be like a routine guest appearance, like stumbling through warpdoors fighting freakish halo creatures, you know for comic relief."
02-09-2019T20:10:58,CrimsonQuill,Ummmm
02-09-2019T20:11:01,CrRAR,xD
02-09-2019T20:11:03,CrimsonQuill,That could be a problem
02-09-2019T20:11:27,CrimsonQuill,Because my idea is that first...the fireteam leader meets her in a past battle
02-09-2019T20:11:34,CrimsonQuill,And then again in Spartan Training
02-09-2019T20:11:43,CrRAR,I see
02-09-2019T20:11:46,CrimsonQuill,"And she's the squad's sniper. Along with AI RED,"
02-09-2019T20:11:49,CrimsonQuill,(Oh shoot)
02-09-2019T20:11:54,CrRAR,lol
02-09-2019T20:12:07,Mikemkke034,Hmm
02-09-2019T20:12:17,Mikemkke034,Entire story arc?
02-09-2019T20:12:19,CrimsonQuill,(I've just realised that's TWO characters I need to ask permisson to use)
02-09-2019T20:12:21,CrimsonQuill,And yes
02-09-2019T20:12:26,CrimsonQuill,Entire story arc
02-09-2019T20:12:30,CrimsonQuill,That's the dilemma
02-09-2019T20:12:44,Mikemkke034,Hmm
02-09-2019T20:12:48,CrimsonQuill,"My main OC, Bailey, will have a leadership arc"
02-09-2019T20:13:05,CrimsonQuill,My OC Adams will have an arc about letting go of grudges and working as a team member
02-09-2019T20:13:31,CrimsonQuill,"And the idea I hope for with Raine is moving past the loss of her ODST squadmate, and dealing with the PTSD."
02-09-2019T20:13:50,Mikemkke034,Ah. I'd love to see this
02-09-2019T20:15:50,CrimsonQuill,"And she'd be in Air assault armour, because Air Assault is an improvement on ODST, so...logic?"
02-09-2019T20:15:56,CrimsonQuill,I think?
02-09-2019T20:16:19,CrimsonQuill,Ummm..permission to link Bailey's reference sheet to give an idea as to what I'm working to?
02-09-2019T20:16:43,Mikemkke034,You can whisper it
02-09-2019T20:17:14,CrimsonQuill,"CrRAR, would you like to see it?"
02-09-2019T20:17:38,Mikemkke034,Nice!
02-09-2019T20:17:42,Mikemkke034,You drew that?
02-09-2019T20:17:45,CrimsonQuill,"Yes,"
02-09-2019T20:17:51,CrimsonQuill,I'm quite proud of it
02-09-2019T20:17:58,Mikemkke034,That is great
02-09-2019T20:18:17,CrimsonQuill,:)
02-09-2019T20:18:22,Mikemkke034,One sec. I've got a b/w sketch that I drew the other day
02-09-2019T20:18:34,CrimsonQuill,Halo?
02-09-2019T20:18:37,Mikemkke034,No
02-09-2019T20:18:59,CrRAR,Yes?
02-09-2019T20:21:36,CrimsonQuill,Well...
02-09-2019T20:21:45,CrimsonQuill,As much as I want to wait for Tom to come back...
02-09-2019T20:21:50,CrimsonQuill,It's 2:21am.
02-09-2019T20:21:57,CrimsonQuill,My eyes are heavy.
02-09-2019T20:21:59,Mikemkke034,You should get some rest
02-09-2019T20:22:04,CrimsonQuill,I...should probably sleep.
02-09-2019T20:22:29,Mikemkke034,Yep
02-09-2019T20:22:30,CrimsonQuill,"Look, if Tom comes back, may you please tell him I had to go to sleep?"
02-09-2019T20:22:39,Mikemkke034,Yeah
02-09-2019T20:22:42,Mikemkke034,I will
02-09-2019T20:22:43,IronHorseComics,nope
02-09-2019T20:22:45,CrimsonQuill,And that I'll probably be back tomorrow.
02-09-2019T20:23:11,CrimsonQuill,"God, I'll pay for this later."
02-09-2019T20:23:24,CrimsonQuill,Sleep well everyone. Goodnight.
02-09-2019T20:23:26,Mikemkke034,Get some rest Crimson. You deserve it

02-09-2019T22:40:36,Ordithus,nice nice
02-09-2019T22:41:13,Twokinds,I ate most of it. Can hardly move now.
02-09-2019T22:41:49,Ordithus,"haha!  Maaan when I was back in Madison last week I wanted some Korean.  Had Vietnamese which was really good, though"
02-09-2019T22:43:30,Ordithus,The only spicy food I've had in a while
02-09-2019T22:47:13,Twokinds,Vietnamese sounds good too XD
02-09-2019T22:47:20,Twokinds,Spicy is great
02-09-2019T22:47:41,Ordithus,I live where potato is considered spicy :ctwokinds-LauraCry:
02-09-2019T22:48:26,Twokinds,That sounds terrible!
02-09-2019T22:50:17,Ordithus,"ok, I do exaggerate.  But not much"
02-09-2019T22:56:41,SpazztasticKiwi,you got two kinds of people here
02-09-2019T22:56:54,SpazztasticKiwi,those who want the hot wings
02-09-2019T22:57:13,SpazztasticKiwi,and those who ask if the hot wings are spicy
02-09-2019T22:57:27,SpazztasticKiwi,I cannot make this stuff up
02-09-2019T22:59:59,Ordithus,Hm?  I think we both want the hot wings.  I may be less practiced
02-09-2019T23:04:15,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t understand how they can ask if the hot wings are hot
02-09-2019T23:04:44,SpazztasticKiwi,"if you look at em in the case, they’re literally orange red with sauce"
02-09-2019T23:05:42,Ordithus,"Just because someone says something is spicy, doesn't mean it is."
02-09-2019T23:06:17,SpazztasticKiwi,and how does that make sense
02-09-2019T23:06:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"there may be degrees, but there’s still a base line between spice and mild"
02-09-2019T23:07:03,Ordithus,"Different standards of spice, marketing"
02-09-2019T23:07:18,Ordithus,I encounter this a lot in the land of the hot dish
02-09-2019T23:10:38,SpazztasticKiwi,in any case I have a low tolerance for it
02-09-2019T23:10:43,SpazztasticKiwi,not a fan at all
02-09-2019T23:11:06,SpazztasticKiwi,"if I wanted flames shooting out of any part of me, I’d become a politician"
