08-07-2019T00:42:58,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-reniderp_flip:
08-07-2019T00:45:20,BadFoMo,Yo.
08-07-2019T00:45:34,BadFoMo,Back already?
08-07-2019T00:54:22,Twokinds,Yup!
08-07-2019T00:54:57,iliar,"@Bgrmystr2, About Bot. I fixed it only yesterday. To connect to the chat you need to generate an access token. But the generation function of this token was broken. I can generate this token by hand, but this must be done every 24 hours."
08-07-2019T00:55:02,iliar,"Therefore, despite the fact that you could see the bot in the chat and before that I can not call it ""I fixed it"""
08-07-2019T00:56:01,Bgrmystr2,Ah I was under the assumption that you fixed it earlier before I had woken up
08-07-2019T00:56:12,Bgrmystr2,"though I guess that might have been ""yesterday"" for you lol"
08-07-2019T00:57:01,Bgrmystr2,since it was about 8 hrs ago I woke up and several hours prior that you had talked about it
08-07-2019T00:59:08,iliar,"Tom, could you please answer at my email with subject ""Merch and some questions"""
08-07-2019T01:01:10,iliar,"In my time zone is 9AM. For me it was yesterday, but maybe for you it is still today."
08-07-2019T01:01:34,SpazztasticKiwi,ay Tom
08-07-2019T01:01:38,SpazztasticKiwi,again
08-07-2019T01:05:44,CrimsonQuill,morning.
08-07-2019T01:07:52,Twokinds,I will
08-07-2019T01:07:57,Twokinds,But I have to sleep right now
08-07-2019T01:08:22,iliar,"Good night, Tom!"
08-07-2019T01:08:38,CrimsonQuill,Sleep Well Tom.
08-07-2019T01:14:51,SpazztasticKiwi,night Tom
08-07-2019T01:15:23,Bgrmystr2,"well it just changed day for me, it's 1:15am now"
08-07-2019T01:20:20,SpazztasticKiwi,🛌
08-07-2019T01:23:17,CrimsonQuill,shower time
08-07-2019T01:23:21,CrimsonQuill,And breakfast

08-07-2019T09:34:33,Orthonox,Mornin'
08-07-2019T09:34:45,CrimsonQuill,Hullo
08-07-2019T09:35:23,Orthonox,"How are you doing, Quill?"
08-07-2019T09:42:30,AspiringNoodle,"Mmmm, apples"
08-07-2019T09:42:48,AspiringNoodle,But I cut to close to center on some slices :ptv-shock:
08-07-2019T09:43:06,CrimsonQuill,Fine thanks Orthonox
08-07-2019T09:43:09,CrimsonQuill,I have tea
08-07-2019T09:43:20,CrimsonQuill,And I realise that Left 4 Dead is utterly terrifying
08-07-2019T09:50:07,AspiringNoodle,i have diet dew
08-07-2019T09:50:21,AspiringNoodle,And you just now realize that?!?
08-07-2019T10:06:00,Orthonox,Never played that game but it never come across as a scary game from the gameplay other than surprise zombie ambushes.
08-07-2019T10:10:42,AspiringNoodle,"You should play Amnesia, the scariest monster is a ball :ptv-snicker:"
08-07-2019T10:15:33,Orthonox,"I'll get around to that game someday. It's on my library. In the meantime, I got Resident Evil 2 REMAKE on my plate."
08-07-2019T10:15:50,CrimsonQuill,I like Zoey
08-07-2019T10:22:44,AspiringNoodle,"I already have all the amnesia stuff in my library, and I just bought a bunch of games yesterday"
08-07-2019T10:22:50,AspiringNoodle,"Sadly, RE2 was not on the list :P"
08-07-2019T10:23:12,AspiringNoodle,"I was going for a larger game library rather than the latest releases, so I bought some older games that are highly acclaimed <3"
08-07-2019T10:23:44,AspiringNoodle,Let me just pull up my receipt
08-07-2019T10:26:02,AspiringNoodle,"Dark Souls 2: SotFS, Dark Souls 3 Deluxe Edition, Spec Ops: The Line, Doom (2016), Yooka-Laylee Deluxe Edition (gotta give my heroes some love), Hollow Knight, Night in the Woods, and Ori and the Blind Forest: Definitive Edition"
08-07-2019T10:26:44,AspiringNoodle,"It seems silly to buy the edition of Yooka-Laylee with the artbook and soundtrack, but these guys made Banjo-Kazooie, and Chu recently had a stream a few weeks ago where she made some fanart"
08-07-2019T10:26:51,AspiringNoodle,And guess what music was playing the entire time? :)
08-07-2019T10:53:26,CrimsonQuill,I just got the complete Valve Collection on Steam Sale for €5:00
08-07-2019T10:56:37,CrimsonQuill,"I have Doom (2016), but can't play it, because my computer is a potato."
08-07-2019T11:07:10,TerraTheWizard,rip
08-07-2019T11:07:11,AspiringNoodle,^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
08-07-2019T11:07:16,AspiringNoodle,"No GPU, lol"
08-07-2019T11:07:25,CrimsonQuill,:ctwokinds-keithdotdotdot:
08-07-2019T11:07:29,AspiringNoodle,"At least I have an igpu, so I can still play Overwatch"
08-07-2019T11:07:34,AspiringNoodle,at lowest settings...
08-07-2019T11:07:36,AspiringNoodle,and 360p...
08-07-2019T11:07:44,CrimsonQuill,I can play Elite dangerous...
08-07-2019T11:07:48,AspiringNoodle,and above 30 fps ;_;
08-07-2019T11:07:58,CrimsonQuill,But it pushes my 12gb ram and ssd to the limits
08-07-2019T11:08:10,AspiringNoodle,"Something went screwy with my system, and it won't recognize my gtx 970 OR my gtx 560"
08-07-2019T11:08:29,AspiringNoodle,"If it was just the 970, I'd say my card died, and that's a bummer, but it can happen"
08-07-2019T11:08:51,AspiringNoodle,"But BOTH???  And the 560's been in storage and worked the last time I plugged it in??? Naw, somethin else is happenin"
08-07-2019T11:09:43,AspiringNoodle,"However, I'm so close to building a new system that I can't bother to get it checked out until the new one's up and running."
08-07-2019T11:10:12,CrimsonQuill,XD
08-07-2019T11:10:27,AspiringNoodle,"Btw, ""close"" probably means end of July, earliest!"
08-07-2019T11:10:38,AspiringNoodle,So much shit is sold out right now
08-07-2019T11:11:42,AspiringNoodle,"All of AMD's new processors are sold out, a good amount of the X570 boards are sold out, lots of RAM is sold out (more expensive 3200 and 3600 sticks, at that), and the new super cards are pretty much sold out."
08-07-2019T11:13:53,AspiringNoodle,"Wow, just checked out that Valve collection"
08-07-2019T11:14:14,CrimsonQuill,Yah
08-07-2019T11:14:17,CrimsonQuill,It has EVERYTHING
08-07-2019T11:14:19,AspiringNoodle,"If I only bought the Half-Life, Portal, and L4D titles at their current discount, I'd spend $9.50 before tax"
08-07-2019T11:14:48,CrimsonQuill,"I am so pumped for Reach on PC right now,"
08-07-2019T11:15:07,CrimsonQuill,I literally have Halo Raine as my desktop background...XD
08-07-2019T11:15:39,AspiringNoodle,I just want a new working computer
08-07-2019T11:16:00,AspiringNoodle,Also people to figure what the hell is going on with Zen 2 and its drivers
08-07-2019T11:16:04,CrimsonQuill,I just want a computer that is not a potato for less than €500
08-07-2019T11:16:14,CrimsonQuill,Something that can run Doom and Halo and Crysis
08-07-2019T11:17:31,AspiringNoodle,"Sorry, maybe in 2030.  You know, when the titles are over a decade old :P"
08-07-2019T11:18:27,CrimsonQuill,I have a year and a half before Infinite to get some money anyhow.
08-07-2019T11:18:29,CrimsonQuill,:)
08-07-2019T11:19:53,AspiringNoodle,I've been saving for years >:3
08-07-2019T11:20:06,AspiringNoodle,Mainly because 1440p gaming requires stupidly powerful hardware ._.
08-07-2019T11:21:30,AspiringNoodle,I'm surprised the RTX 2080 hasn't had a price drop yet.  The Super update comes out in 2 weeks (pending any delays)
08-07-2019T11:21:48,AspiringNoodle,And the 2070 super is rather close to the 2080 in terms of performance
08-07-2019T11:23:39,TeapotOfDoom,They want yo moneyy
08-07-2019T11:23:47,CrimsonQuill,Hello there Teapot!
08-07-2019T11:23:52,TeapotOfDoom,Hi guys
08-07-2019T11:24:17,TeapotOfDoom,Going to work again in screwing with my inner clock
08-07-2019T11:24:23,TeapotOfDoom,Also exhausting
08-07-2019T11:24:29,CrimsonQuill,Are you alright?
08-07-2019T11:24:52,TeapotOfDoom,Jup just much to do ^^
08-07-2019T11:25:16,TeapotOfDoom,Keeps me from living on american time at least ^^
08-07-2019T11:25:16,AspiringNoodle,"For now, work is a necessary ""evil"""
08-07-2019T11:25:32,AspiringNoodle,"Maybe in the future, corporate jobs can be told to suck it, and we'll have actually meaningful jobs xD"
08-07-2019T11:26:15,TeapotOfDoom,Well i like the job i have. I work there every time my uni doesnt keep me from it
08-07-2019T11:27:38,TeapotOfDoom,I get to do some awesome stuff. We're currently working on a pcb for a mini synthesizer for example. We're planning on giving these away at a exhibition we're participating in
08-07-2019T11:28:13,CrimsonQuill,"I'm trying to study for some exams in surveying-maths, GIS and Spatial analysis."
08-07-2019T11:28:19,CrimsonQuill,Emphasis on trying.
08-07-2019T11:28:32,TeapotOfDoom,Haha been there done that
08-07-2019T11:28:44,TeapotOfDoom,When are the exams?
08-07-2019T11:29:03,CrimsonQuill,August
08-07-2019T11:29:30,TeapotOfDoom,Spacial analysis does not sound easy...
08-07-2019T11:29:49,CrimsonQuill,Spatial Analysis and GIS is all computer stuff
08-07-2019T11:29:52,CrimsonQuill,Geodatabases
08-07-2019T11:29:59,CrimsonQuill,Travelling Salesperson Problem
08-07-2019T11:30:03,CrimsonQuill,Raster vs Boolean
08-07-2019T11:30:05,CrimsonQuill,etch
08-07-2019T11:30:14,TeapotOfDoom,Ah ok so the first one's the culprit?
08-07-2019T11:30:52,CrimsonQuill,Yeah
08-07-2019T11:30:56,CrimsonQuill,It;s tricky
08-07-2019T11:31:05,CrimsonQuill,Especially since I never understood the notes
08-07-2019T11:31:13,CrimsonQuill,But this time! I will triumph
08-07-2019T11:31:17,CrimsonQuill,My other problem is....
08-07-2019T11:31:23,TeapotOfDoom,Oh that makes things kinda hard to begin with
08-07-2019T11:31:29,CrimsonQuill,After all of these years I still cannot study properly.
08-07-2019T11:31:57,TeapotOfDoom,Getting distracted?
08-07-2019T11:32:26,CrimsonQuill,Always
08-07-2019T11:33:18,TeapotOfDoom,One thing that tends to help me is listening to quiet music. I use the tk playlist mostly. Eliminates mental background noise
08-07-2019T11:33:50,CrimsonQuill,It's more the fact that most of my notes are on the internet....
08-07-2019T11:34:29,TeapotOfDoom,"Kinda tempting, isn't it?"
08-07-2019T11:34:39,CrimsonQuill,Too tempting.
08-07-2019T11:34:55,CrimsonQuill,Rrrrgh...I have no self control...nor the patience to develop it....
08-07-2019T11:35:03,TeapotOfDoom,Oh i know this problem so well
08-07-2019T11:35:05,CrimsonQuill,Plus I am severely depressed...
08-07-2019T11:35:16,CrimsonQuill,Or at least was until recently
08-07-2019T11:35:59,AspiringNoodle,"I know the feeling, kinda"
08-07-2019T11:36:05,TeapotOfDoom,One other thing that helped me at that was meditation. Trains your mind to focus
08-07-2019T11:36:07,TeapotOfDoom,Brb
08-07-2019T11:36:29,AspiringNoodle,"Having multiple anxiety episodes which could be summed up as mid-life crises, and I'm not even over 30!"
08-07-2019T11:36:36,CrimsonQuill,Meditation? As in just sitting and being quiet?
08-07-2019T11:36:52,CrimsonQuill,I spent 2 weeks minding the house alone
08-07-2019T11:37:01,CrimsonQuill,I don't cope well with isolation
08-07-2019T11:37:09,CrimsonQuill,Even though I was able to ring and chat...
08-07-2019T11:37:20,CrimsonQuill,I just...need someone to be physically there.
08-07-2019T11:37:32,TeapotOfDoom,Back.
08-07-2019T11:37:38,CrimsonQuill,WB
08-07-2019T11:37:39,TeapotOfDoom,Someone called sry
08-07-2019T11:37:48,CrimsonQuill,It's ok
08-07-2019T11:37:49,AspiringNoodle,"Dunno about you, but I love being by myself, but when the need to talk to someone hits, it hits hard"
08-07-2019T11:37:51,TeapotOfDoom,Guided meditation mostly
08-07-2019T11:37:56,CrimsonQuill,Hmm
08-07-2019T11:38:26,TeapotOfDoom,Cause the guy keeps telling you to focus
08-07-2019T11:38:33,CrimsonQuill,It got to the point that the game/Interactive story 'Missed Messages' and Jacksepticeye's speech after playing it probably saved my life...
08-07-2019T11:38:45,CrimsonQuill,I just don't like being alone.
08-07-2019T11:39:00,TeapotOfDoom,Also trying to keep focus in a not preassured way helps you do it with other tasks too
08-07-2019T11:39:16,CrimsonQuill,Hmmm
08-07-2019T11:39:31,CrimsonQuill,I know that one thing I need to do is not spend so much time on my computer...
08-07-2019T11:39:34,CrimsonQuill,But I still do it
08-07-2019T11:39:46,CrimsonQuill,I'm always afraid that I'll miss something
08-07-2019T11:39:57,TeapotOfDoom,You don't
08-07-2019T11:40:11,TeapotOfDoom,That's the beauty of the internet
08-07-2019T11:40:40,CrimsonQuill,...
08-07-2019T11:41:01,CrimsonQuill,"It is nice though, to be reading TK again at the moment."
08-07-2019T11:41:25,CrimsonQuill,"My webcomic routine when I'm reading it is to stop everything else at 9:30, read a chapter and sleep."
08-07-2019T11:41:53,CrimsonQuill,"On Sunday night, I read the 10th anniversary chapter and rewatched the stream where Halo Raine was sketched..."
08-07-2019T11:42:03,CrimsonQuill,I suppose I just need to switch off a bit.
08-07-2019T11:42:14,CrimsonQuill,Chapter 18 tonight-a great one.
08-07-2019T11:42:24,TeapotOfDoom,Lota stress the last few weeks?
08-07-2019T11:42:40,CrimsonQuill,"Yes,"
08-07-2019T11:43:22,CrimsonQuill,"I do wonder whether my frantic net surfing is making me less and less patient, shortening my attention span..."
08-07-2019T11:43:53,TeapotOfDoom,Well it's not really relaxation that's for sure
08-07-2019T11:44:04,AspiringNoodle,"Take it from me, try to not obsess about ultimately meaningless thigs"
08-07-2019T11:44:18,AspiringNoodle,I've been spinning my wheels endlessly since I graduated
08-07-2019T11:44:40,CrimsonQuill,Yeah...
08-07-2019T11:44:59,CrimsonQuill,I'm glad I found Missed Messages. It made me think that I needed to ask for help.
08-07-2019T11:45:05,AspiringNoodle,"I still need to get a job, and hopefully once I do, I'll actually start moving forward.  It'll help if I have something to take me out of my thoughts 4 - 8 hours a day, 5 days a week :)"
08-07-2019T11:45:45,TeapotOfDoom,"Well if you think you need it, it's a good thing you realized"
08-07-2019T11:45:52,AspiringNoodle,I think I'm still in shock over how shitty the game development industry is...
08-07-2019T11:45:59,AspiringNoodle,^
08-07-2019T11:46:05,AspiringNoodle,Don't be afraid to talk to other people
08-07-2019T11:46:17,TeapotOfDoom,^ +1000
08-07-2019T11:46:39,AspiringNoodle,My anxiety episodes only really got resolved once I talked with other people
08-07-2019T11:46:54,CrimsonQuill,"Yeah, I talked to my parents about it."
08-07-2019T11:47:06,TeapotOfDoom,Did it help?
08-07-2019T11:47:15,CrimsonQuill,"Yes, it did..."
08-07-2019T11:47:22,CrimsonQuill,As did the hugs.
08-07-2019T11:47:39,CrimsonQuill,I didn't even realise how badly off I was until I was talking about it.
08-07-2019T11:47:48,TeapotOfDoom,That sounds really good
08-07-2019T11:48:00,CrimsonQuill,Yeah.
08-07-2019T11:48:02,CrimsonQuill,It is.
08-07-2019T11:48:03,CrimsonQuill,:)
08-07-2019T11:48:17,TeapotOfDoom,Props to you
08-07-2019T11:48:18,CrimsonQuill,And there's so much to enjoy...I just need to give it the time it deserves.
08-07-2019T11:48:34,AspiringNoodle,"I hope your problems are more easily resolved than ""my life's direction has been a giant lie, I would've been better off sticking to art when I was younger"""
08-07-2019T11:48:38,CrimsonQuill,I think the biggest obstacle in my mind is the idea that I need to experience everything right away.
08-07-2019T11:48:54,CrimsonQuill,I'm going into surveying because I love maps.
08-07-2019T11:49:16,CrimsonQuill,"Althought the technical side of things is really hard, if I get over it, I'm set for life."
08-07-2019T11:49:18,CrimsonQuill,Besided...
08-07-2019T11:49:18,AspiringNoodle,At least it's not game development!
08-07-2019T11:49:31,CrimsonQuill,Whatever I choose as a career there'll be parts I hate.
08-07-2019T11:49:40,AspiringNoodle,^ the unfortunate truth
08-07-2019T11:49:43,CrimsonQuill,"And even if I chose art, there'd be parts I hate."
08-07-2019T11:49:48,TeapotOfDoom,Noodle i think you're degree in game dev will be more useful in urt then u think
08-07-2019T11:50:00,AspiringNoodle,"I didn't get a game dev degree, though :P"
08-07-2019T11:50:04,CrimsonQuill,I'm sure there are days where Tom just wishes that he could take a break...understandable.
08-07-2019T11:50:12,AspiringNoodle,That'd be kinda useless should I leave the field or not go into it at all!
08-07-2019T11:50:35,TeapotOfDoom,Imagine having ro keep to a stream schedule all year round on sundays
08-07-2019T11:50:40,CrimsonQuill,And Bill Watterson said in the Calvin and Hobbes books that his comic was a full time job for him.
08-07-2019T11:50:40,AspiringNoodle,"I got a run-of-the-mill CS degree with a concentration in CG (probably shittier at that than CS), and a minor in art."
08-07-2019T11:50:47,AspiringNoodle,Definitely preferred the art classes -w-
08-07-2019T11:50:56,CrimsonQuill,I'm keeping art as a hobby for now.
08-07-2019T11:51:06,CrimsonQuill,I am SLOWLY but SURELY improving.
08-07-2019T11:51:23,TeapotOfDoom,You lucky guys
08-07-2019T11:51:29,CrimsonQuill,One day I hope to reach Tom and Watterson's standard.
08-07-2019T11:51:30,TeapotOfDoom,I cant draw shit
08-07-2019T11:51:34,CrimsonQuill,XD
08-07-2019T11:51:41,CrimsonQuill,Permission to whisper something to you guys?
08-07-2019T11:51:47,TeapotOfDoom,I tried drawing a freakin teapot
08-07-2019T11:51:51,CrimsonQuill,Oh
08-07-2019T11:51:54,AspiringNoodle,I recommend looking up the levels of art
08-07-2019T11:51:56,CrimsonQuill,How bad was it?
08-07-2019T11:52:08,TeapotOfDoom,It was not round to say the least
08-07-2019T11:52:14,CrimsonQuill,Oh dear
08-07-2019T11:52:32,AspiringNoodle,"I could always share my urn sketch, lol"
08-07-2019T11:52:39,TeapotOfDoom,"No for real i dont think im that bad, though i would have to practise a lot more"
08-07-2019T11:52:45,AspiringNoodle,"Overall, it was pretty good, but there's a major flaw I can't believe I didn't catch"
08-07-2019T11:52:45,CrimsonQuill,Would it be ok to whisper my Deviantart Gallery to you too?
08-07-2019T11:52:51,TeapotOfDoom,Also permission granted
08-07-2019T11:52:56,CrimsonQuill,Coolk
08-07-2019T11:53:07,CrimsonQuill,"Aspiring, would you like to see?"
08-07-2019T11:53:23,CrimsonQuill,It's not brilliant but it's a start
08-07-2019T11:53:23,TeapotOfDoom,"One question though, for safety"
08-07-2019T11:53:35,CrimsonQuill,@TeapotOfDoom yes?
08-07-2019T11:53:38,TeapotOfDoom,Is it safe to open it on the bus?
08-07-2019T11:53:40,AspiringNoodle,"sure, and I'll share some imgur links to my art stuff :P"
08-07-2019T11:53:46,CrimsonQuill,Absolutely safe
08-07-2019T11:53:57,AspiringNoodle,"That said, it's been like a year since I graduated and I haven't really attempted to finish any new drawings :/"
08-07-2019T11:53:57,TeapotOfDoom,Ok. Just had to ask xD
08-07-2019T11:54:12,CrimsonQuill,It's all lego at the start and drawings at the end
08-07-2019T11:54:14,AspiringNoodle,"That said, when I was testing out CSP and Affinity Photo, I did draw a tom-style eye, and was soooooo happy~"
08-07-2019T11:54:34,CrimsonQuill,I started Deviantart because I loved lego and met a guy named DanteZX online who did cool buildds...
08-07-2019T11:54:38,CrimsonQuill,We now videochat.
08-07-2019T11:54:51,CrimsonQuill,We babble about lego mechs and Smash bros
08-07-2019T11:54:53,AspiringNoodle,I haven't even attempted drawing people yet xD
08-07-2019T11:55:06,CrimsonQuill,I can draw men with some...competence
08-07-2019T11:55:13,CrimsonQuill,Proportions and hands are still a bit iffy
08-07-2019T11:55:22,AspiringNoodle,My turn >:3
08-07-2019T11:55:23,CrimsonQuill,I can't really draw women yet.
08-07-2019T11:55:33,CrimsonQuill,So umm...whadya guys think?
08-07-2019T11:55:44,TeapotOfDoom,I say your proportions are closer then you think
08-07-2019T11:55:48,CrimsonQuill,Oh thanks
08-07-2019T11:55:51,CrimsonQuill,Got to go
08-07-2019T11:55:53,CrimsonQuill,Dinner time
08-07-2019T11:55:56,CrimsonQuill,Whisper me the link
08-07-2019T11:56:00,TeapotOfDoom,Have at it
08-07-2019T11:56:17,TeapotOfDoom,Cya
08-07-2019T11:56:42,TeapotOfDoom,Also the detail in the armor really looks good
08-07-2019T11:57:31,AspiringNoodle,"Teapot, wanna see some horrible drawings? :D"
08-07-2019T11:58:16,CrimsonQuill,@AspiringNoodle got link and you're better than me
08-07-2019T11:58:19,CrimsonQuill,Off to dinner
08-07-2019T11:58:21,CrimsonQuill,Cya
08-07-2019T11:58:22,CrimsonQuill,:)
08-07-2019T11:58:27,CrimsonQuill,:ptv-victory:
08-07-2019T11:58:32,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-ohmy:
08-07-2019T11:59:41,TeapotOfDoom,Gimme
08-07-2019T12:00:20,AspiringNoodle,Basic Drawing >:3
08-07-2019T12:01:53,TeapotOfDoom,The one with the flown ink (for lack of a better name) looks really cool
08-07-2019T12:02:34,TeapotOfDoom,Also did you use coal for the last one?
08-07-2019T12:02:38,AspiringNoodle,I wish they were in chronological order
08-07-2019T12:03:00,AspiringNoodle,Combination of ink and marker
08-07-2019T12:03:05,AspiringNoodle,Because I fucked up the ink so badly
08-07-2019T12:03:34,AspiringNoodle,I got 2 other ones that are unrelated
08-07-2019T12:04:32,AspiringNoodle,First one is a quick 5-10 min sketch with a photo reference I did for another artist during a gameplay livestream
08-07-2019T12:04:41,AspiringNoodle,She was having bad luck with her rats getting sick and / or dying :(
08-07-2019T12:05:24,AspiringNoodle,Second one was for a 2d design project which I admittedly cheesed / cheated on by doing that picture
08-07-2019T12:05:58,TeapotOfDoom,Cause it's not 2d?
08-07-2019T12:06:07,TeapotOfDoom,It looks cool though
08-07-2019T12:06:24,AspiringNoodle,"Nah, the idea was to create an album cover for a song using a defined color palette (in this case all neutrals)"
08-07-2019T12:06:37,AspiringNoodle,But I feel like it was cheating because it was a full render
08-07-2019T12:06:59,TeapotOfDoom,What do you mean?
08-07-2019T12:07:25,AspiringNoodle,Full spectrum as opposed to clearly defined colors
08-07-2019T12:07:54,TeapotOfDoom,You mean you would have had to use monochrome?
08-07-2019T12:08:03,TeapotOfDoom,Also i m home gimme a sek
08-07-2019T12:08:33,AspiringNoodle,"Imagine that image instead with 5 defined colors.  Say pure white, 25/50/75% gray, and black."
08-07-2019T12:10:21,AspiringNoodle,"I wanted to mention, I used a photo reference only to establish the outline"
08-07-2019T12:10:49,AspiringNoodle,"Suffice to say, eff realism xD"
08-07-2019T12:11:07,AspiringNoodle,"Or at least, 100% accurate realism"
08-07-2019T12:16:42,TeapotOfDoom,Well the result's nice
08-07-2019T12:17:17,TeapotOfDoom,Did you have fun with cd yet?
08-07-2019T12:24:02,AspiringNoodle,Does not compute
08-07-2019T12:26:15,TeapotOfDoom,Error 418: I am a teapot
08-07-2019T12:26:39,TeapotOfDoom,It's nice to have your own http error code
08-07-2019T12:26:40,CrimsonQuill,Hello there! I am back.
08-07-2019T12:26:51,TeapotOfDoom,General Kenobi!
08-07-2019T12:27:59,CrimsonQuill,"May the Force be with you, fellow Jedi."
08-07-2019T12:28:14,TeapotOfDoom,Someone just sent Dave Jones from the Eevblog a letter why free energy exists
08-07-2019T12:28:27,TeapotOfDoom,Srsly
08-07-2019T12:28:55,CrimsonQuill,Wait....WHAT?
08-07-2019T12:29:13,TeapotOfDoom,Yeah... best person to send such a letter to
08-07-2019T12:30:08,TeapotOfDoom,It's like telling a cartographer like you the earth is flat
08-07-2019T12:30:45,CrimsonQuill,And Free energy doesn't exist anyway...
08-07-2019T12:30:55,CrimsonQuill,Unless you count the sun
08-07-2019T12:31:07,CrimsonQuill,And that'll run out in 5 billion years.
08-07-2019T12:31:35,TeapotOfDoom,I the concept is even more stupid then flat earth. Cause it really exists. But not in the way they claim
08-07-2019T12:31:48,TeapotOfDoom,Cause yeah the sun
08-07-2019T12:32:00,CrimsonQuill,Yeah
08-07-2019T12:32:03,TeapotOfDoom,Or any kind of electromagnetic radiaton
08-07-2019T12:32:07,CrimsonQuill,That too
08-07-2019T12:32:10,TeapotOfDoom,*radiation
08-07-2019T12:32:31,CrimsonQuill,So ummm...how was my gallery?
08-07-2019T12:32:53,TeapotOfDoom,"And they be like ""why don't we just harvest free energy?"" Get a freakin solar panel mate xD"
08-07-2019T12:33:07,CrimsonQuill,True that-solar panels are very goof.
08-07-2019T12:33:10,CrimsonQuill,good.
08-07-2019T12:33:15,TeapotOfDoom,You did gud
08-07-2019T12:33:19,CrimsonQuill,:)
08-07-2019T12:33:53,TeapotOfDoom,Lost the dm cause mobile picarto tends to lag and reloading gets rid of dms
08-07-2019T12:35:09,CrimsonQuill,I see
08-07-2019T12:35:29,CrimsonQuill,I want to make a reference sheet for my OC
08-07-2019T12:35:51,CrimsonQuill,And once I can draw properly I can add Raine to the Fireteam.
08-07-2019T12:35:54,TeapotOfDoom,But for just a hobby the drawings look really nice. You have a lot of detail in the armor
08-07-2019T12:36:02,CrimsonQuill,"Oh, thanks!"
08-07-2019T12:36:26,CrimsonQuill,I know that Raine'd have Air Assault halo armour because she's ex-ODST and that armour suits the role.
08-07-2019T12:36:46,CrimsonQuill,And Bailey will have either a hybrid MKIV or an armour of my own designt
08-07-2019T12:36:52,TeapotOfDoom,You mean the halo raine image?
08-07-2019T12:38:28,CrimsonQuill,Yeah
08-07-2019T12:38:44,CrimsonQuill,"When I requested it and it won, I was elated"
08-07-2019T12:39:09,CrimsonQuill,Then I decided to try draw Kessah from HoSalamanstra in halo armour-thought it'd be rubbish.
08-07-2019T12:39:12,TeapotOfDoom,I should have figured it was your suggestion ^^
08-07-2019T12:39:28,CrimsonQuill,But it turned out a lot better than I expected and inspired me to draw more and more.
08-07-2019T12:39:39,CrimsonQuill,So now I am working on an OC for Halo
08-07-2019T12:39:55,CrimsonQuill,I think my favourite of the pics I draw is the Portal 2 one
08-07-2019T12:39:57,TeapotOfDoom,So you haven't been drawing that long?
08-07-2019T12:40:01,CrimsonQuill,Well...
08-07-2019T12:40:05,CrimsonQuill,I've doodled for years
08-07-2019T12:40:15,CrimsonQuill,The oldest drawing I uploaded is from 2014
08-07-2019T12:40:36,CrimsonQuill,But this was the first time I really decided to continuously draw-And colour-a series of pictures.
08-07-2019T12:40:49,CrimsonQuill,After my exams i intend to get back into the groove.
08-07-2019T12:40:55,AspiringNoodle,I plan to do a shit ton of sketches at some point :P
08-07-2019T12:40:56,CrimsonQuill,More drawings! More sketches!
08-07-2019T12:41:04,CrimsonQuill,I sketched my dad on the sofa today
08-07-2019T12:41:05,AspiringNoodle,"Like, just load up pictures of many different animals"
08-07-2019T12:41:08,CrimsonQuill,Proportions ok
08-07-2019T12:41:09,AspiringNoodle,Then humans
08-07-2019T12:41:15,CrimsonQuill,Shading needs work
08-07-2019T12:41:17,AspiringNoodle,Then maybe try drawing animal humans :p
08-07-2019T12:41:20,CrimsonQuill,But the face was ok
08-07-2019T12:41:31,CrimsonQuill,Animal humans-ya mean Keidran?
08-07-2019T12:41:43,CrimsonQuill,Oh yeah
08-07-2019T12:41:43,AspiringNoodle,Or furries in general :P
08-07-2019T12:42:04,CrimsonQuill,Did ya see the 'Everything except the kitchen sink'?
08-07-2019T12:42:34,AspiringNoodle,Oh god
08-07-2019T12:42:42,AspiringNoodle,"*turns around, sees sink*"
08-07-2019T12:42:42,CrimsonQuill,Oh God what?
08-07-2019T12:42:46,AspiringNoodle,"""FEK YOU!!!"""
08-07-2019T12:42:46,CrimsonQuill,Yeah
08-07-2019T12:42:53,CrimsonQuill,"That was me. No exaggeration,"
08-07-2019T12:42:58,CrimsonQuill,I packed too much.
08-07-2019T12:43:04,AspiringNoodle,The only reasonable response <3
08-07-2019T12:43:10,CrimsonQuill,And had to walk for 20 minutes with that stuff.
08-07-2019T12:43:22,TeapotOfDoom,I maybe have but on mobile you don't see titles
08-07-2019T12:43:26,CrimsonQuill,And then get on a bus
08-07-2019T12:43:33,CrimsonQuill,And carry it another 5 minutes
08-07-2019T12:43:44,CrimsonQuill,I decided to draw a caricature of myself afterwards.
08-07-2019T12:43:55,CrimsonQuill,"Because seriously, I should not have had that much with me."
08-07-2019T12:44:26,CrimsonQuill,I really love how it turned out.
08-07-2019T12:44:34,TeapotOfDoom,I see everything but the sink right now
08-07-2019T12:44:49,TeapotOfDoom,Because incidently i'm leaning against it
08-07-2019T12:44:57,CrimsonQuill,XD
08-07-2019T12:45:10,TeapotOfDoom,I really am xD
08-07-2019T12:45:28,AspiringNoodle,*checks social blade*

08-07-2019T12:45:56,TeapotOfDoom,Huh?
08-07-2019T12:46:06,CrimsonQuill,I'm considering re-drawing the art trade with Archangel470 though.
08-07-2019T12:46:11,CrimsonQuill,I rushed it towards the end.
08-07-2019T12:46:18,AspiringNoodle,The amount of subscribers they've lost today is pretty low (so far) compared to the past week or so
08-07-2019T12:46:24,CrimsonQuill,Armour is out of proportion and not as well coloured.
08-07-2019T12:46:36,AspiringNoodle,"But then again, their lowest day (~1,800) was followed by a day with double the loss"
08-07-2019T12:46:43,CrimsonQuill,Ooof
08-07-2019T12:46:45,CrimsonQuill,Nasty
08-07-2019T12:46:51,AspiringNoodle,It's been going on for a week
08-07-2019T12:46:53,TeapotOfDoom,Who are those guys?
08-07-2019T12:47:04,AspiringNoodle,They went from being up like 15k subscribers for the month to down 10k
08-07-2019T12:47:16,TeapotOfDoom,What did they do?
08-07-2019T12:47:20,AspiringNoodle,"A channel about game design, but they've become corrupted over time"
08-07-2019T12:47:27,AspiringNoodle,The idealogues infested them

08-07-2019T12:48:40,AspiringNoodle,Supposedly the warning signs have been here for years

08-07-2019T12:49:27,TeapotOfDoom,*shakes head* Um sry what happened?
08-07-2019T12:49:39,CrimsonQuill,I threw in gratuitous Gaelic.

08-07-2019T12:51:44,AspiringNoodle,EC's video is extremely hypocritical
08-07-2019T12:51:48,TeapotOfDoom,Haha title the best
08-07-2019T12:51:55,AspiringNoodle,Does a complete 180 on stances they had in the past
08-07-2019T12:51:55,CrimsonQuill,lol
08-07-2019T12:52:10,AspiringNoodle,As well as being complete garbage in terms of accuracy
08-07-2019T12:53:16,AspiringNoodle,"Not to mention some of their ""suggestions"" completely go against the entire purpose of the channel: elevating game design to higher heights"
08-07-2019T12:53:37,TeapotOfDoom,There's a video of a guy painting a penis on the wall with bullet holes in a shooter multiplayer. And some random nps in the background screas (in german) what are you idiots doing? I need reinforcement
08-07-2019T12:54:00,CrimsonQuill,WHAT. THE. HECK

08-07-2019T12:57:08,AspiringNoodle,It points out just about everything wrong with their script / arguments
08-07-2019T12:57:42,AspiringNoodle,As has been said for many other channels / companies
08-07-2019T12:57:55,AspiringNoodle,The mask has slipped.  The video shows what the people behind the channel really believe
08-07-2019T12:58:10,CrimsonQuill,Be back soon
08-07-2019T12:58:18,AspiringNoodle,"Their thoughts, ideas, and biases are now front and center.  And because they put out a video like this, now all their content moving forward is suspect"
08-07-2019T12:58:27,TeapotOfDoom,Since ill be gone soon too bye quill
08-07-2019T12:58:38,AspiringNoodle,They'll be back ;)
08-07-2019T12:59:34,AspiringNoodle,"Now, to be fair, this isn't the first time they've put out a political video"
08-07-2019T12:59:59,TeapotOfDoom,Wall i can tell you for a fact that playing violent video games weakens your inner repellent for violence. Everything you do has an effect on you
08-07-2019T13:00:00,AspiringNoodle,"But this the first time they put one out that's so horrible, that it's indefensible.  And they've doubled down every chance they've gotten!"
08-07-2019T13:00:33,AspiringNoodle,Research says otherwise
08-07-2019T13:00:41,AspiringNoodle,And I mean a LOT of research
08-07-2019T13:00:42,TeapotOfDoom,Still i don't think that it can make an average guy violent
08-07-2019T13:01:04,TeapotOfDoom,Yes that's what i mean
08-07-2019T13:01:28,AspiringNoodle,Personal views? Maybe.  Inclination towards violent acts?  Hell no.
08-07-2019T13:01:52,TeapotOfDoom,It also is not the cause but the consequence of violent behioure
08-07-2019T13:02:04,TeapotOfDoom,Holy i spelled that wrong
08-07-2019T13:02:15,TeapotOfDoom,Behaviour
08-07-2019T13:02:54,AspiringNoodle,"What's funny is that studies found that any increased inclination towards acting ""violently"" is also found in another commonly accepted activity"
08-07-2019T13:02:58,AspiringNoodle,Aka watching sports ;)
08-07-2019T13:03:15,TeapotOfDoom,There was a study where they tried if people were ready to aim at other people an if there were a difference after being exposed to violent games.
08-07-2019T13:03:21,TeapotOfDoom,Answer: no
08-07-2019T13:04:22,AspiringNoodle,"I found the video to be extremely condescending, tbh"
08-07-2019T13:04:37,AspiringNoodle,Person buys shooter
08-07-2019T13:04:45,AspiringNoodle,Shooter is based around historical events
08-07-2019T13:04:47,TeapotOfDoom,Still it has an effect on personal views and lowers some stuff. But it's like trying to demolish the great wall of china with a garden hose
08-07-2019T13:04:57,AspiringNoodle,"Person plays as Nazi: ""I didn't ask for this."""
08-07-2019T13:05:28,TeapotOfDoom,Well. Now ima nazi. What evs. FÜR DEUTSCHLAND!
08-07-2019T13:05:48,TeapotOfDoom,Lol
08-07-2019T13:07:36,AspiringNoodle,EC's twitter has relatively limited engagement
08-07-2019T13:07:49,AspiringNoodle,"But just about most comments now are ""We're not letting you pretend like that video didn't happen"""
08-07-2019T13:08:18,AspiringNoodle,I'm kinda glad I unsubbed
08-07-2019T13:08:52,TeapotOfDoom,"How about putting out a clarification? Or an apology? Or a ""well that vidoe was kinda off, we just really dislike the way it's implemented""?"
08-07-2019T13:10:03,AspiringNoodle,I don't think that's happening
08-07-2019T13:10:15,AspiringNoodle,They've either doubled down or deflected any wrong doing on their part
08-07-2019T13:10:27,AspiringNoodle,And have since then basically refused to acknowledge it
08-07-2019T13:10:48,AspiringNoodle,I hope you watched both videos I linked ;)
08-07-2019T13:15:39,TeapotOfDoom,Only had the time to watch the first one till noc
08-07-2019T13:15:41,TeapotOfDoom,Now
08-07-2019T13:17:38,AspiringNoodle,"If you watch the 2nd one, you realize how malicious the video is"
08-07-2019T13:17:53,AspiringNoodle,"Because that this point we can't say it was an accident, because they refuse to back down"
08-07-2019T13:18:13,AspiringNoodle,Double down = intentional
08-07-2019T13:27:42,TeapotOfDoom,It seams to be
08-07-2019T13:27:54,TeapotOfDoom,Now that's some high level english
08-07-2019T13:28:13,AspiringNoodle,Finally watch the 2nd one?
08-07-2019T13:28:19,TeapotOfDoom,His argument is legitimate
08-07-2019T13:28:21,TeapotOfDoom,Yes
08-07-2019T13:29:20,TeapotOfDoom,He made the same point as i did earlier. Desensitication is a thing but using that many hypotheticals to come to such a conclusion is just absurd
08-07-2019T13:29:33,AspiringNoodle,It's legitimate slippery slope
08-07-2019T13:30:16,TeapotOfDoom,Also as he said this argument would mean that no real or derived faction would be allowed to exist within a game
08-07-2019T13:30:40,TeapotOfDoom,"Which is must impossible and, in short, stupid"
08-07-2019T13:30:49,TeapotOfDoom,*just
08-07-2019T13:31:15,TeapotOfDoom,Also i'm heading out for a run

08-07-2019T18:27:01,SpazztasticKiwi,have you ever gone shopping with a woman
08-07-2019T18:27:14,SpazztasticKiwi,they don’t do pockets for us
08-07-2019T18:27:23,SpazztasticKiwi,in anything
08-07-2019T18:27:25,CrRAR,On... occasion.
08-07-2019T18:27:46,CrRAR,I know it's a momentous occasion!

08-07-2019T19:14:28,IronHorseComics,*walks in to a conversation about women's pockets* only time I've seen pockets for women's clothing is on blue jeans and maybe khaki pants
08-07-2019T19:14:38,IronHorseComics,at least off the top of my head
08-07-2019T19:15:52,AspiringNoodle,Why do they put pockets on skinny jeans?
08-07-2019T19:15:56,AspiringNoodle,They're useless
08-07-2019T19:17:10,IronHorseComics,"I prefer baggy clothing, not because of fashion sense but because I like a loose fit on my fat self, makes me feel less like I'm being presented as a side show"
08-07-2019T19:17:50,IronHorseComics,plus the pockets are useful
08-07-2019T19:18:29,IronHorseComics,"especially on cargo shorts/pants, I can safe a boat load on candy at the movies by going to walmart first and sticking them in the extra pockets"
08-07-2019T19:27:25,AspiringNoodle,"AMD, plz, restock Ryzen processors ;_;"
08-07-2019T19:28:12,IronHorseComics,AMD: Eeeeehhhhhhh no.
08-07-2019T19:29:51,AspiringNoodle,...might have found a workaround
08-07-2019T19:29:59,AspiringNoodle,Just order the processor from another retailer ;)
08-07-2019T19:29:59,IronHorseComics,blackmarket
08-07-2019T19:30:15,AspiringNoodle,"Newegg, gone, Amazon, they only have the 3700x and one is left (probably sold out now)"
08-07-2019T19:30:28,AspiringNoodle,"But Best Buy and B&H Photo are selling, too"

08-07-2019T19:37:51,FloofyCat,"Nah Noodle, to be a reviewer, you just have to know how to have a seizure on a keyboard with a very sophisticated autocorrect."
08-07-2019T19:38:02,AspiringNoodle,Like... bruh... this is common knowledge... and x8 still doesn't bottleneck...
08-07-2019T19:41:14,Bgrmystr2,you don't need to be a HUMAN to be a reviewer.*
08-07-2019T19:41:18,Bgrmystr2,Fixed that for you.
08-07-2019T19:48:46,IronHorseComics,that's it! these bad reviewers are just brain sucking aliens who struggle with the English language
