16-12-2019T00:01:24,Ordithus,so no
16-12-2019T00:01:33,SpazztasticKiwi,https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/524825976597643265/629088428323110944/image0.jpg

16-12-2019T00:02:24,Ordithus,tis
16-12-2019T00:02:36,SpazztasticKiwi,"thing is I thought of it, giggles"
16-12-2019T00:02:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"then I made that, more giggles"
16-12-2019T00:03:08,SpazztasticKiwi,and now I just think about it and
16-12-2019T00:03:11,SpazztasticKiwi,giggles
16-12-2019T00:03:20,Ordithus,you are quite giggly
16-12-2019T00:03:32,Ordithus,and share in the giggles
16-12-2019T00:03:38,SpazztasticKiwi,its so stupid but manages to be so funny
16-12-2019T00:04:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I blame youtube for most of my sense of humor
16-12-2019T00:04:50,SpazztasticKiwi,example: Se√°n‚Äôs floppy banana but now has me sniggering at bananas
16-12-2019T00:04:55,SpazztasticKiwi,bit
16-12-2019T00:06:13,Ordithus,bananas are the source of much humor
16-12-2019T00:06:56,SpazztasticKiwi,have you seen the video of the little boy who finds and starts waggling around his mom‚Äôs ‚Äúbanana‚Äù
16-12-2019T00:07:04,Ordithus,oh god
16-12-2019T00:07:07,Ordithus,no I have not
16-12-2019T00:07:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"husband is of course the one filming, wheezing laughing"
16-12-2019T00:08:00,Ordithus,that poor sweet innocent child
16-12-2019T00:08:07,SpazztasticKiwi,while she‚Äôs trying to chase/coax the kid to give it back
16-12-2019T00:08:40,Ordithus,that kid will remember one day and :ptv-RainbowThrowup:
16-12-2019T00:08:56,SpazztasticKiwi,meanwhile he‚Äôs just standing there flopping it around like a pool noodle
16-12-2019T00:11:54,SpazztasticKiwi,aaand Bagheera spooked himself again
16-12-2019T00:12:55,Ordithus,"Good talking with you, good night!  I must sleeep. :ctwokinds-RainezZz:"
16-12-2019T00:23:11,AspiringNoodle,"Oh dear lord, those sketches!"

16-12-2019T01:48:50,AspiringNoodle,I feel like I'm spending too much time on this game...
16-12-2019T01:50:29,AspiringNoodle,Whelp.  Next weekend will be fun.  Gonna take a look at how I'm allocating my time :P
16-12-2019T01:57:08,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-nibsdance:
16-12-2019T01:58:53,SpazztasticKiwi,so how close to death are you
16-12-2019T01:59:27,Twokinds,I am immortal
16-12-2019T01:59:51,Sclimshady,That sounds exhausting
16-12-2019T02:00:10,SpazztasticKiwi,"ya know, I‚Äôve heard of people who have literal years logged into that game"
16-12-2019T02:00:25,SpazztasticKiwi,if you‚Äôre immortal how are you aging
16-12-2019T02:02:15,SpazztasticKiwi,"unless that‚Äôs your way of saying ‚Äúif I deny the pain, it doesn‚Äôt exist‚Äù"
16-12-2019T02:02:22,AspiringNoodle,Tom is like a phoenix
16-12-2019T02:02:32,AspiringNoodle,"One day, he'll be really old and suddenly burst into flames"
16-12-2019T02:02:40,AspiringNoodle,And then a baby will crawl from the ashes
16-12-2019T02:02:42,Sclimshady,Tom is Teddy?
16-12-2019T02:03:28,AspiringNoodle,"anyways, yeah Kiwi"
16-12-2019T02:03:39,AspiringNoodle,"I find myself saying that I'll do this or that, and call it quits"
16-12-2019T02:03:51,AspiringNoodle,"And slowly over time, I have to slap myself in the face and reel myself back"
16-12-2019T02:05:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom you ever had a deep fried oreo
16-12-2019T02:05:57,Twokinds,Can't say I have
16-12-2019T02:07:49,SpazztasticKiwi,they‚Äôre pretty ok - for some reason I‚Äôve been wanting a couple
16-12-2019T02:09:01,SpazztasticKiwi,oh and can anyone explain this guy‚Äôs logic that came up to the case today:
16-12-2019T02:09:17,SpazztasticKiwi,"older man, real nice, sorta quiet"
16-12-2019T02:10:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"got some food and while I‚Äôm gathering it up to ring up, he says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry if you find this offensive, and I don‚Äôt mean to be rude but you‚Äôre very pretty‚Äù"
16-12-2019T02:10:59,SpazztasticKiwi,"someone tell me how ‚Äúoffensive‚Äù, ‚Äúrude‚Äù and ‚Äúpretty‚Äù go together"
16-12-2019T02:12:52,SpazztasticKiwi,cause it didn‚Äôt bug me at all
16-12-2019T02:15:31,AspiringNoodle,"If you pay attention to the political bubbles on social media, you'll have idiots REEEEEEEEE'ing that he was objectifying you by pointing out that you are ""pretty"""
16-12-2019T02:17:01,AspiringNoodle,"Also, I'm starting to regret resubbing to WoW"
16-12-2019T02:17:19,AspiringNoodle,Though only time will tell if I actually regret it or if it's just the sleep deprivation and that I didn't have much time today...
16-12-2019T02:18:55,SpazztasticKiwi,nah he was plenty nice about it - maybe he felt odd cause he was older
16-12-2019T02:20:58,SpazztasticKiwi,only other kind of news is the lady who let her crotch goblin banshee screech all through the store
16-12-2019T02:24:57,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-reniderp:
16-12-2019T02:25:39,SpazztasticKiwi,a little louder
16-12-2019T02:49:38,SpazztasticKiwi,"and for anyone who missed it the first time: there was the lady who asked, while holding up said chicken in its plastic container ‚Äúcan you put this in a box?‚Äù"
16-12-2019T02:59:00,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-nataniAAAAshake:
16-12-2019T03:01:00,SpazztasticKiwi,I was plain confused
16-12-2019T03:01:41,SpazztasticKiwi,did she want the original container in another box? transfer the chicken into the box and throw out the original container?
16-12-2019T03:02:45,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
16-12-2019T03:02:53,SpazztasticKiwi,she walked off without my attempt for a reply anyhow so ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
