10-01-2019T21:06:43,Tharkis,and the back is already falling apart after 4 weeks
10-01-2019T21:06:58,Tharkis,mesh back keeps popping out of the holders in the side
10-01-2019T21:07:00,SageSaga,since i work at home and in this chair- im in this chair for the majority of each day every day generally-
10-01-2019T21:07:16,Bgrmystr2,"there we go, deleting all the cookies fixed it"
10-01-2019T21:07:27,SageSaga,and the floof inside the chair seat has all kinda gone flat or gotten displaced

10-01-2019T21:45:47,w0lfmare,What if the one I watch is the best Sage?
10-01-2019T21:45:49,SageSaga,Retsuko wasnt really the best option in any of them
10-01-2019T21:46:08,SageSaga,then you have watched many things this year or you are wrong?
10-01-2019T21:46:09,MarvTheHugPharaoh,she's cute so I vote
10-01-2019T21:46:56,Mippy,I haven’t watched many things this year...fell out of my hobby due to mental health stuff. Trying to catch up
10-01-2019T21:48:03,CrRAR,aww
10-01-2019T21:48:36,Mippy,I’ll have to binge a bunch of stuff.
10-01-2019T21:48:43,CrRAR,"Hobbies are good, they energize the soul~"
10-01-2019T21:49:13,SageSaga,"Best Protag - Rimuru, Best Antag- Ryo, Best Boy - Sakuta (Deku already won Best Boy last year)"
10-01-2019T21:49:35,Mippy,"Yup, any suggestions on what to watch?"
10-01-2019T21:49:36,SageSaga,Best Girl for 2018 would have been hard
10-01-2019T21:49:49,CatzArt,"Hello all, sorry im late!"
10-01-2019T21:49:54,SageSaga,if Rascal Does Not Dream Of Bunny Girl Senpai wasnt on there! Mai wins
10-01-2019T21:49:56,CrRAR,hey Catz
10-01-2019T21:49:59,FoxxTrotter,"Hi, Catz."
10-01-2019T21:50:03,KiTA,Mippy:  Recent anime to watch?
10-01-2019T21:50:03,CrRAR,not by too long
10-01-2019T21:50:12,KiTA,Re: That time I got reincarnated as a Slime is really good
10-01-2019T21:50:18,Mippy,Sure KiTA
10-01-2019T21:50:29,SageSaga,Yeah Slime is still one of the best to watch ATm
10-01-2019T21:50:41,KiTA,Goblin Slayer is supposed to be excellent if you like dark stuff
10-01-2019T21:50:47,KiTA,it's basically a D&D campaign animated
10-01-2019T21:50:49,CatzArt,Oh I'm glad I came. Toms drawing construction lines Ive been waiting to see how he did his.
10-01-2019T21:50:51,Mippy,Silly title... I’ll write it down
10-01-2019T21:51:01,SageSaga,Its ok- the First episode sets the wrong tone for the show
10-01-2019T21:51:18,SageSaga,^ Thats about goblin slayer
10-01-2019T21:51:22,KiTA,The first episode reminds you that Goblins are horrific little always chaotic evil monsters and not to be considered jokes
10-01-2019T21:51:22,CatzArt,Goblin slayer is pretty good. Ive been working my way through the light novels
10-01-2019T21:51:57,SageSaga,I am Currently super excited for Rising of the Shield Hero
10-01-2019T21:52:08,Mippy,"Cool, that’s two x)"
10-01-2019T21:52:30,SageSaga,After i saw the first episode (well first 2 in one)
10-01-2019T21:52:36,CatzArt,Two of what Mippy?
10-01-2019T21:52:40,SageSaga,I read the entire Manga
10-01-2019T21:52:42,Mippy,I have no idea what’s coming up
10-01-2019T21:52:46,KiTA,Rising of the Shield Hero is good
10-01-2019T21:52:52,KiTA,but it's this season's controversial anime
10-01-2019T21:53:00,ShadowSoap,"Good Evening, everyone :D"
10-01-2019T21:53:00,KiTA,and if the season ends where I think it will end
10-01-2019T21:53:04,Hg17Lamont2002,Rocky gonna get them 0^0
10-01-2019T21:53:08,Mippy,Anime Catz
10-01-2019T21:53:12,SageSaga,cept it isnt really controversial
10-01-2019T21:53:14,KiTA,expect every woke hipster blog on the planet to have a freakout about it
10-01-2019T21:53:16,Hg17Lamont2002,Wassup soap
10-01-2019T21:53:27,unsteddyphoenix,Sage

10-01-2019T21:53:35,unsteddyphoenix,Not even close
10-01-2019T21:53:37,unsteddyphoenix,Also hiiii
10-01-2019T21:53:41,KiTA,"Oh, sage, don't you know?  There's no such thing as rape hoaxes, and thus Shield Hero is inherently controversial because of it... or somesuch"
10-01-2019T21:53:56,KiTA,Tumblr was freaking out about it
10-01-2019T21:54:16,Mippy,:ctwokinds-keithdotdotdot:
10-01-2019T21:54:16,CatzArt,Yeah I found a good manga called Drifting Dragons. But that might just be because I have a soft spot for Airships of any kind.
10-01-2019T21:54:20,ZahnHolley,Hello guys
10-01-2019T21:54:23,KiTA,I gave up trying to understand woke hipsters long ago
10-01-2019T21:54:28,SageSaga,Rape Hoax is a perfect example of weaponized rumors
10-01-2019T21:54:28,HeresyArtStream,:cheresyartstream-SOBHeresy:
10-01-2019T21:54:32,CatzArt,Hello Zahn!

10-01-2019T21:55:02,SageSaga,also its very well explained why it worked so well - theres a huge backstory to it
10-01-2019T21:55:16,ZahnHolley,Its been awhile how yall been?
10-01-2019T21:55:22,Mippy,I’m gonna go over there now :point_right:

10-01-2019T21:55:54,ShadowSoap,"Been doin' fine, Zahn. How 'bout you?"
10-01-2019T21:55:54,CatzArt,good first week of classes is done. But I'm tired from my 7:30 am bird lab. How are you Zahn?
10-01-2019T21:55:55,Grishmark,Hello all
10-01-2019T21:55:58,Tharkis,only thing i didnt like about shield hero intro was
10-01-2019T21:55:59,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"mommy, sage don't fight"
10-01-2019T21:56:00,unsteddyphoenix,Both!
10-01-2019T21:56:02,Tharkis,we're told it's a matriarchy
10-01-2019T21:56:05,ShadowSoap,Hello Grish!
10-01-2019T21:56:07,CatzArt,hello Grish!
10-01-2019T21:56:08,Tharkis,"but the king, all his advisors, and everyone in power"
10-01-2019T21:56:09,ZahnHolley,Good so far
10-01-2019T21:56:10,Tharkis,are all men
10-01-2019T21:56:23,Hg17Lamont2002,Lively night tonight
10-01-2019T21:56:29,SageSaga,Rimuru cant be best boy or best girl because Rimiru has no sex!
10-01-2019T21:56:31,Tharkis,other than that i enjoyed it so far
10-01-2019T21:56:38,SageSaga,you are disrespecting Rimu!
10-01-2019T21:56:40,Tharkis,rimuru tempest is best IT ! =D
10-01-2019T21:57:05,Tharkis,"the manga makes a point of rimuru discovering they're neuter , but can make themselves look more female or male"
10-01-2019T21:57:05,unsteddyphoenix,"Best protag is bunyn dude, best boy is tsundere dragon Tempest"
10-01-2019T21:57:08,unsteddyphoenix,Fact.
10-01-2019T21:57:09,CatzArt,Yup Rimiru is best I cant wait to see what happens in episode 14
10-01-2019T21:57:12,KiTA,"Sage:  I'm glad you're taking such a mature stance on Shield Hero... so, SO, SOOOO many people freaking out about it on Tumblr and Twitter heh"
10-01-2019T21:57:24,KiTA,Apparently the dub is delayed
10-01-2019T21:57:38,Nekonny,hows this?
10-01-2019T21:57:40,KiTA,the rumor is one of the voice actresses found out about the plot and the woke hipster reaction and refused to finish her lines
10-01-2019T21:58:09,CatzArt,I havent seen shield hero. what is it about and can i go all medieval enthusiast and say that his shield isnt historically accurate?
10-01-2019T21:58:22,KiTA,"It's an Isekai series, but actually pretty good."
10-01-2019T21:58:22,SageSaga,People get triggered before they  look into things-
10-01-2019T21:58:36,KiTA,"4 guys get pulled into an alternate universe to fend off ""waves"" of monsters every so many weeks or whatever"
10-01-2019T21:58:41,Tharkis,people look for excuses to become offended
10-01-2019T21:58:43,KiTA,Each one gets a special weapon
10-01-2019T21:58:44,SageSaga,which Actress? What character was she playing?
10-01-2019T21:58:45,KiTA,"Sword, Spear, Bow..."
10-01-2019T21:59:08,N45,hello
10-01-2019T21:59:11,KiTA,"Sage:  I don't know, I didn't research it in depth.  The controversy made my head hurt, and I'm so so tired of woke hipsters heh"
10-01-2019T21:59:16,CatzArt,Hello N45
10-01-2019T21:59:20,KiTA,"Anyway, sword, bow, spear... and our hero, who gets a Shield."
10-01-2019T21:59:30,KiTA,"He's SUPPOSED to be the tank of the group, except, well"
10-01-2019T21:59:30,SageSaga,Are you familiar with the entire story?
10-01-2019T21:59:52,Tharkis,y'know what manga needs an anime?  Dungeon Meshi !
10-01-2019T22:00:01,KiTA,"Entire story of shield hero, or the entire story of the dub thing?  The former:  No, I'm a bit behind in the manga.  The latter:  No, just heard the rumor"
10-01-2019T22:00:07,Tharkis,"(or ""delicious in dungeon"")"
10-01-2019T22:00:11,KiTA,"He's supposed to be the tank, but, well..."
10-01-2019T22:00:16,Twokinds,ugh this is why I don't sketch on stream
10-01-2019T22:00:20,Twokinds,the comic*
10-01-2019T22:00:24,KiTA,"The rest of the heroes, alongside the king and princess, are HORRIFIC ASSHOLES"
10-01-2019T22:00:32,KiTA,"Like, the most vile people you can imagine"
10-01-2019T22:00:40,SageSaga,Everyone is a jerk- its like real life!
10-01-2019T22:00:44,KiTA,outside of maybe the sages / other characters in Instant Death
10-01-2019T22:00:51,Bgrmystr2,:( but I believe in you tom
10-01-2019T22:00:58,unsteddyphoenix,You can DO it.
10-01-2019T22:01:01,unsteddyphoenix,Or you cant
10-01-2019T22:01:04,unsteddyphoenix,ONe of those is true
10-01-2019T22:01:06,Bgrmystr2,xD
10-01-2019T22:01:07,Apostrophe,We believe in you
10-01-2019T22:01:08,KiTA,So they basically screw the Shield Hero over in some pretty horrific ways
10-01-2019T22:01:13,Bgrmystr2,He can do it.
10-01-2019T22:01:16,Nekonny,"Well, I'll continue then ^^"""
10-01-2019T22:01:16,KiTA,But he claws his way back up from nothing
10-01-2019T22:01:19,ShadowSoap,"""Do or do not. There is no try."""
10-01-2019T22:01:27,CatzArt,Im enjoying the sketch tom. Its very good and I wanted to see how you did construction lines for a while. so my wish came true this stream
10-01-2019T22:01:31,Bgrmystr2,"but there IS an attempt, soap."
10-01-2019T22:01:44,Hg17Lamont2002,Lol
10-01-2019T22:01:44,ShadowSoap,:I
10-01-2019T22:01:46,ZRO4825,"Upon reading an articl eabout why there's controversy over the show, I find it funny that people are trying to be angry at the show for what is essentially an everyday issue to begin with."
10-01-2019T22:01:50,Hg17Lamont2002,I agree bgr
10-01-2019T22:02:10,KiTA,"ZRO:  The thing is, according to Woke Hipsterdom, it's NOT an everyday issue"
10-01-2019T22:02:14,KiTA,"""it literally never happens"""
10-01-2019T22:02:17,Bgrmystr2,"Shield Hero, Zro? I don't know anything much about it, but the synopsis doesn't even look all that bad"
10-01-2019T22:02:31,SageSaga,The character that makes the false Rape accusation is a sociopath.
10-01-2019T22:02:34,Mippy,Tom! Tom! he’s our man! If he can’t do it...there’ll be a lot of frustrated erasing
10-01-2019T22:03:01,KiTA,"Oh yes she is, very much so"
10-01-2019T22:03:04,KiTA,But if she was in our world
10-01-2019T22:03:15,KiTA,"she'd have pink hair, problem glasses, and a Tumblr blog ranting about the Patriarchy :P"
10-01-2019T22:03:34,Zakuru,YES finally colored!!!
10-01-2019T22:03:35,ZRO4825,"Right, KiTA, and that's what I think is funny, because it *is* a problem, lol. ""Woke"" people be some funny folk."
10-01-2019T22:04:09,SageSaga,She's constantly using others to get her way- shes a terrible person- but there are good people in the show
10-01-2019T22:04:09,Bgrmystr2,"to be fair, they're not even using ""woke"" properly, zro"
10-01-2019T22:04:13,Bgrmystr2,so there's that.
10-01-2019T22:04:31,KiTA,"It's pretty bad.  I was involved in the culture war stuff from a few years back, and I saw the woke types get really REALLY vicious to my trans and POC friends who disagreed with them"
10-01-2019T22:04:51,CatzArt,Mippy I think art could be described as fustrated erasing
10-01-2019T22:05:20,ZRO4825,"That much I fully agree with you on, Bgr."
10-01-2019T22:05:51,SageSaga,I get what people thought- but its a product of current culture- which Japan doesnt share atm
10-01-2019T22:06:10,ZRO4825,"Also, can't seem to find anything about a voice actress having issues with Shield Hero."
10-01-2019T22:06:29,SageSaga,"they thought - ""Oh! A story about a fake rape! Well this is just pushing the male agenda that women are liars"""
10-01-2019T22:06:29,CatzArt,Yeah Kita I avoid the stuff like the plague. The only time ive ever gone off on somebody because he was an anti vaccine person
10-01-2019T22:06:45,Bgrmystr2,women.. can lie? No way..
10-01-2019T22:06:51,Bgrmystr2,it's like they're human or something.
10-01-2019T22:06:59,Bgrmystr2,capable of just as many bad things as men are.
10-01-2019T22:07:01,Bgrmystr2,oh noes.
10-01-2019T22:07:12,KiTA,There's literally a sociological effect where people refuse to believe that
10-01-2019T22:07:19,KiTA,"It's called the ""Women are wonderful"" effect"
10-01-2019T22:07:20,SageSaga,She chose to frame him for that for a reason - it was to ruin his reputation and make no one help him or believe him
10-01-2019T22:07:30,KiTA,Well here's the thing
10-01-2019T22:07:36,KiTA,Without getting too much into spoilers
10-01-2019T22:07:44,KiTA,It's actually racism hidden as false rape
10-01-2019T22:07:52,KiTA,because of what the Shield Hero IS and represents
10-01-2019T22:08:11,KiTA,"And, more specifically, the Demi Humans"
10-01-2019T22:08:15,KiTA,and the Church of the 3 Heroes
10-01-2019T22:08:47,SageSaga,people then are worried its going to continue to be controversial- because it ends with him going to a place to buy a slave :P
10-01-2019T22:09:01,Hg17Lamont2002,Oof
10-01-2019T22:09:03,Tharkis,"all i know is there was a kemonomimi girl in the first 30 seconds of the show, so i'm watching it to the end !"
10-01-2019T22:09:06,Tharkis,:ctharkis-earwiggle:
10-01-2019T22:09:27,Tharkis,easy to hook me into watching a show
10-01-2019T22:09:31,ZRO4825,lol
10-01-2019T22:09:31,CatzArt,ohh what kind of slavery. the generic american kind?
10-01-2019T22:09:32,SageSaga,"and people have a huge issue with this- but im like - ITS A FANTASY GAME WORLD! YOU CANT JUST PRETEND STUFF LIKE THAT DIDNT EXIST!"""
10-01-2019T22:10:00,unsteddyphoenix,Ooh yeah thats the worst sage
10-01-2019T22:10:05,SageSaga,It looks like most if not all Slaves in this kingdom are DemiHumans
10-01-2019T22:10:14,unsteddyphoenix,"""Its supposed to be UNREALISTIC"""
10-01-2019T22:10:21,SageSaga,thats not to say in a DemiHuman country there arent Human slaves
10-01-2019T22:10:43,KiTA,I'm worried that woke hipsters will infest the localization companies
10-01-2019T22:10:57,KiTA,"They already are pretty prevelant at Crunchyroll, whose employees run a blog called ""Anime Feminist"""
10-01-2019T22:11:19,CatzArt,Kita wasnt there some issue with the new cowboy bebop trying to be woke or something?
10-01-2019T22:11:25,SageSaga,the point is- they sometimes literally kicked this guy down to the lowest point ever- hes going to literally DIE because he cant level up without help to fight off the bad guys that are coming
10-01-2019T22:11:46,KiTA,Yeah
10-01-2019T22:11:54,KiTA,About Cowboy bebop
10-01-2019T22:11:57,KiTA,although I don't know specifics
10-01-2019T22:12:08,KiTA,I know there's a rumor they are re-dubbing Evangelion in order to make it woke
10-01-2019T22:12:18,SageSaga,While it seems like it is going to become a Revenge plot anime- it rises above and beyond that- its great
10-01-2019T22:12:34,SageSaga,oh but the controversy is gonna get way worse soon XD
10-01-2019T22:12:57,KiTA,"If the season ends with the Queen, then holy god we'll see Woke Riots at Starbucks"
10-01-2019T22:12:57,CatzArt,I hope they dont Kita or they will face the worst enemy since the nazis. ANIME FANS!
10-01-2019T22:13:09,KiTA,"Catz:  Oh man, ""nazis"""
10-01-2019T22:13:22,KiTA,"Woke hipsters use ""Nazi"" and ""Fascist"" as random words meaning ""bad person"""
10-01-2019T22:13:24,SageSaga,"for a little while- not long though- he developed a ""All women are awful"" mentality"
10-01-2019T22:13:42,ZRO4825,Like just about any man falsely accused and then outcast by society would.
10-01-2019T22:13:43,Glowy3,What anime are you guys talking about?
10-01-2019T22:13:50,SageSaga,Rising of the Shield Hero
10-01-2019T22:13:59,unsteddyphoenix,Honestly this all sounds interesting
10-01-2019T22:14:03,unsteddyphoenix,Prolly gonna watch it
10-01-2019T22:14:13,KiTA,"Well, they're also saying he's an Incel because of it, but really he's more MGTOW than anything else"
10-01-2019T22:14:17,SageSaga,He will then realize - People in general are terrible- but not all of them :P
10-01-2019T22:14:27,KiTA,I like the Not-Chocobo girl
10-01-2019T22:14:32,SageSaga,Also he gets a hot Raccoon Girl
10-01-2019T22:14:34,CrRAR,dat Karen face
10-01-2019T22:14:35,CrRAR,:ptv-whiny:
10-01-2019T22:14:36,Bgrmystr2,"It was already on my list of things to watch before this coversation even happened, so I'm good."
10-01-2019T22:14:45,KiTA,"I got the first ep, just haven't watched it yet"
10-01-2019T22:15:12,ZRO4825,Incel? MGTOW?
10-01-2019T22:15:20,CatzArt,Kita if you want a fun nazi story look up the battle for Castle Itter. AN epic battle of the USA army and whermacht fighting of nazi ss soldiers
10-01-2019T22:15:40,CatzArt,off not of
10-01-2019T22:15:59,KiTA,"Incel is a term meaning ""Involuntary Celebate.""  Covers people who are ugly who can't find a date, disabled army vets whose wives left them when they came home paralyzed, etc etc."
10-01-2019T22:16:11,ZRO4825,ahh
10-01-2019T22:16:42,SageSaga,and it created a super Toxic environment online that is now just women haters
10-01-2019T22:16:57,CrRAR,ohhhh reddit
10-01-2019T22:17:02,CrRAR,lol
10-01-2019T22:17:03,KiTA,"Woke hipsters use it as a catch all insult because ""lol you have autism and have trouble metting people and don't know to give girls things""  because apparetly insinuating someone can't get laid is an A+ 100% insult"
10-01-2019T22:17:04,CatzArt,This is why I avoid social media Sage.
10-01-2019T22:17:11,SageSaga,and thats what people are going to think Shield Hero is- but it isnt
10-01-2019T22:17:28,CatzArt,It will blow over like it always does
10-01-2019T22:17:45,KiTA,MGTOW is another community of men who generally don't like the idea of the only goal in life to be getting married and supporting a family
10-01-2019T22:17:50,KiTA,"""Men Going Their Own Way"""
10-01-2019T22:18:00,CatzArt,Anywho. Anyone else excited that Bungie split from Activision?
10-01-2019T22:18:03,qwe304,twf not going on one night stands is a bad thing in todays society
10-01-2019T22:18:38,KiTA,I'm kinda shocked this discussion hasn't devolved into rage or something... lots of webcomics are pretty freakin' woke haha
10-01-2019T22:18:44,Flake,tbh im pretty sure activition had little to do with destiny 2 besides maybe how they released content and whatnot
10-01-2019T22:18:50,Flake,everything else was pretty much bungie
10-01-2019T22:18:55,KiTA,The typical MGTOW is a rape hoax or divorce survivor
10-01-2019T22:19:01,KiTA,"and yeah, very interesting about Bungie leaving Activision"
10-01-2019T22:19:08,KiTA,from what it sounds
10-01-2019T22:19:12,CatzArt,I have faith that bungie will rise again.
10-01-2019T22:19:16,KiTA,Activision was trying to screw t hem over re Destiny
10-01-2019T22:19:18,CrRAR,Maddie may have snuck her last sneak.
10-01-2019T22:19:19,CrRAR,rip
10-01-2019T22:19:23,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-LauraCry:
10-01-2019T22:19:26,SageSaga,Point is- Rising of the Shield Hero Predates the whole Incel/MGTOW bull crap and they need to realize its not going to end how those people want :P
10-01-2019T22:19:37,CommanderTrace,I like the new picarto app
10-01-2019T22:19:39,w0lfmare,:cw0lfmare-EmberSad:
10-01-2019T22:19:39,Mippy,Eh? I like to watch/read things and make up my mind for myself. I’ll give Shield Hero a go
10-01-2019T22:19:44,KiTA,Wait NEW APP?!
10-01-2019T22:19:46,CrRAR,Unless it's Rocky boi bleeding his own blood
10-01-2019T22:19:50,ShadowSoap,Blood is never a good sign
10-01-2019T22:19:54,Flake,its rare seeing the dev keeping the game. Activition really wanted out of that one
10-01-2019T22:19:56,CatzArt,Hello Wolfmare!
10-01-2019T22:20:16,CommanderTrace,Yeah today updatet

10-01-2019T22:20:55,ZRO4825,That's because Destiny 2 wasn't measuring up to Activision's expectations.
10-01-2019T22:21:02,Hg17Lamont2002,SHES HURT
10-01-2019T22:21:09,CrRAR,"btw, hi unstedd didn't get to say hi yet."

10-01-2019T22:21:21,KiTA,well
10-01-2019T22:21:26,KiTA,from what I understand Destiny is a MMOFPS
10-01-2019T22:21:27,Apostrophe,[Eyes glow red] Stop. Hurting. Maddie.
10-01-2019T22:21:30,Hg17Lamont2002,I think she got thwacked
10-01-2019T22:21:32,CatzArt,"Dont worry if maddie dies. Soap, wolf, pheonix and Kita will go on a quest to recover the dragon balls to resurect her. Monty python Camelot style"
10-01-2019T22:21:32,CrRAR,big owchies
10-01-2019T22:21:41,KiTA,And Acitivion wanted instead a scifi Call of Duty
10-01-2019T22:21:41,ShadowSoap,Who will win? An Infiltration Specialist or One Rocky Boi
10-01-2019T22:21:50,Hg17Lamont2002,Hmm

10-01-2019T22:37:05,SageSaga,Weekend at Bernie's is a dumb movie where two guys end up taking Bernie- a recently dead guy- with them everywhere pretending he is still alive
10-01-2019T22:37:21,Tharkis,"propping him up in a chair with suglasses and a book, waving his arms at people as they pass, etc"
10-01-2019T22:37:23,Twokinds,why?
10-01-2019T22:37:24,FoxxTrotter,Yes...that is a CLASSIC movie. :0)
10-01-2019T22:37:37,CrRAR,wasn't it for an inheritance or something?
10-01-2019T22:37:42,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: I've never heard of it
10-01-2019T22:37:54,Mippy,Haven’t you ever wanted to play with a corpse?
10-01-2019T22:38:27,CatzArt,I dont want to play with a dead corpse Mippy. I already do
10-01-2019T22:38:42,SageSaga,i remember Bernie was like actually trying to have them both killed and framed for Fraud at the business they worked at
10-01-2019T22:38:55,SageSaga,i cant remember what they did but Bernie was their boss and he was stealing
10-01-2019T22:39:06,SageSaga,but somehow Bernie ends up getting killed instead of them
10-01-2019T22:39:27,SageSaga,I cant for the life of my remember why they go on adventures with a dead corpse after that though
10-01-2019T22:39:44,CrRAR,"lololonoooo, Mippy"

10-01-2019T22:41:22,Tharkis,just a 'classic' film of the age
10-01-2019T22:41:28,CatzArt,Or life of brian

10-01-2019T23:41:42,CrRAR,If you stare at a brighter light than is ambient it sometimes helps you sneeze
10-01-2019T23:41:48,TheBeckoner,then i just look like im crying
10-01-2019T23:41:58,TheBeckoner,usually that works

10-01-2019T23:44:40,TheBeckoner,Hello Ord
10-01-2019T23:44:42,CrRAR,Well the idea I guess is that the tickling sensation needs reacting to.
10-01-2019T23:44:56,TheBeckoner,something about the little hairs in the nose or something
10-01-2019T23:45:13,Hg17Lamont2002,Hmm I’ll have to search this up later
