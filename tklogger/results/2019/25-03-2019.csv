25-03-2019T03:16:57,Bgrmystr2,the fuck is tom doin up at 4am
25-03-2019T03:17:03,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
25-03-2019T03:20:13,Twokinds,It took me all day but my build is complete
25-03-2019T03:22:32,iliar,"Wait, you build the computer all day?"
25-03-2019T03:23:05,Twokinds,Yeah.
25-03-2019T03:26:00,iliar,It is too long. Probably you are very worried about cable management.
25-03-2019T03:26:21,Twokinds,Most of it was installing software and settings and backing up files.
25-03-2019T03:26:33,Twokinds,"But yes, I was more careful with cables this time."
25-03-2019T03:26:47,Twokinds,"In my old computer... well, I did not know the meaning of the word cable management."
25-03-2019T03:31:50,iliar,Oh. You took into account the time to install the software. Then it is fast.
25-03-2019T03:35:30,Twokinds,Yeah. I'll probably be working on getting all the settings back to the way I like it for a days still.

25-03-2019T10:17:10,TerraTheWizard,oh no
25-03-2019T10:33:48,CommanderTrace,you have school wifi ?????
25-03-2019T11:13:29,Mippy,Don’t most post secondary institutions?
25-03-2019T11:19:16,CommanderTrace,not inGermany
25-03-2019T11:19:30,CommanderTrace,in Germany
25-03-2019T11:54:52,Mippy,Really? Interesting.
25-03-2019T11:55:20,Mippy,Hope to visit Germany someday when I finish learning my German.
25-03-2019T12:03:33,CommanderTrace,you can speak a little bit german?
25-03-2019T12:03:40,CommanderTrace,nice

25-03-2019T13:53:12,Mippy,I can do very basic German...I’m like a toddler that is just learning to talk. I’m gonna crack down on it this summer when I have time to get back into it.
25-03-2019T14:00:13,Vatruvius,"Hey Tom, quick question. Are you familiar with the Stargate SG-1 series?"
25-03-2019T14:03:41,Xexanoth,Also just a correction yes we do have school WiFi in germany
25-03-2019T14:22:16,Twokinds,"Yeah, I've watched a few episodes. Unfortunately, I haven't seen all of it."
25-03-2019T14:22:25,Twokinds,So I can't say I'm a watcher of the show.
25-03-2019T14:25:13,Vatruvius,"I see, then I suppose I should modify my suggestion just a little bit. I recently got the flu so I had nothing but time to watch the show. Now, I am less then 10 episodes left of the series. A sad day indeed."
25-03-2019T14:29:05,Xexanoth,"uh, stargate suggestion, well you got my vote:ptv-victory:"
25-03-2019T14:30:17,Azumachan,I miss SG.
25-03-2019T14:33:13,Azumachan,"Hello, good afternoon."
25-03-2019T14:33:16,Vatruvius,"I am very late to the party as far as Stargate is concerned, but it came as a pleasant surprise to me that the plot, story, and acting was actually good and not all about CGI, explosions, and nudity. Quality content, hours of it."
25-03-2019T14:37:11,Xexanoth,It didn't last 10 season and multiple spinoffs for nothing
25-03-2019T14:39:03,Vatruvius,Indeed. XD
25-03-2019T15:44:18,Dadrobit,"Ah man, SG-1. Very fond memories there. Not gonna lie, Amanda Tapping, (Sam Carter) was one of my first crushes for real in that series."
25-03-2019T15:55:15,Azumachan,I'm in my field because of this show.
25-03-2019T16:41:50,Mippy,I gotta watch Stargate sometime...I’ve seen the movie at least
25-03-2019T18:06:58,Twokinds,Wanna see my new build? :D

25-03-2019T18:17:33,Twokinds,The rgb is magic
25-03-2019T18:17:40,Bgrmystr2,what CPU did you end up getting
25-03-2019T18:18:07,Twokinds,2700x
25-03-2019T18:18:14,Bgrmystr2,very nice
25-03-2019T18:18:23,Azumachan,no dust filters ?
25-03-2019T18:18:36,Bgrmystr2,"I presume that if the new Ryzen cpu comes out and you want to use one, your motherboard will be capable of running it"
25-03-2019T18:18:43,Bgrmystr2,since they're all the same socket
25-03-2019T18:18:48,Bgrmystr2,only need a motherboard update
25-03-2019T18:18:53,Bgrmystr2,maybe.. if that.
25-03-2019T18:18:55,CrRAR,Most exciting!
25-03-2019T18:18:58,CrRAR,:ccrrar-hyperkeith:
25-03-2019T18:19:11,Twokinds,"Yeah, but I don't see myself needing to upgrade any time soon."
25-03-2019T18:19:18,Bgrmystr2,naw prolly not
25-03-2019T18:19:23,Bgrmystr2,"still, that's amazing, well done"
25-03-2019T18:19:37,Twokinds,Thanks! I am just grateful it booted on the first try.
25-03-2019T18:19:45,QuinnMalachite,"That old case looks very familiar, fractal design core 3000?"
25-03-2019T18:20:07,QuinnMalachite,used one of those for nearly a decade
25-03-2019T18:20:27,Twokinds,"Uh... yeah, I think that's the one."
25-03-2019T18:20:33,Azumachan,"My workstation is similar to the 2.0 ,somehow."
25-03-2019T18:20:57,CrRAR,Yeah I just noticed the pearly case~
25-03-2019T18:20:58,Twokinds,They're both Fractal Design. The new one is the Focus G
25-03-2019T18:21:07,CrRAR,Verrry nicee
25-03-2019T18:21:24,Twokinds,I got it because it was only $50 XD
25-03-2019T18:21:48,QuinnMalachite,You put a $1000 PC in a $50 case D:
25-03-2019T18:22:00,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
25-03-2019T18:22:01,CrRAR,Economically appropriate~
25-03-2019T18:22:03,Twokinds,lol it's a $2000 pc
25-03-2019T18:22:10,Twokinds,I didn't want to spend any more!
25-03-2019T18:22:14,Azumachan,You don't need a 400$ case
25-03-2019T18:22:22,QuinnMalachite,That was me subconciously trying not to be even more jealous
25-03-2019T18:22:29,TerraTheWizard,lol
25-03-2019T18:22:39,CrRAR,Nora enjoys the... simple pleasures anyway
25-03-2019T18:22:44,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-NoraEyebrows:
25-03-2019T18:22:50,QuinnMalachite,"that said, Fractal Design do good stuff, especially if you like sound proofing"
25-03-2019T18:24:11,Bgrmystr2,"man, your new case looks very sleek, nicely cable managed"
25-03-2019T18:24:54,Twokinds,Thanks XD It's my first time really trying with cable management.
25-03-2019T18:25:31,QuinnMalachite,hard drives all neatly tucked away on the back
25-03-2019T18:26:22,Bgrmystr2,Wish I could do that with my case
25-03-2019T18:26:27,Bgrmystr2,it doesn't have that option
25-03-2019T18:26:49,Bgrmystr2,there's not even enough room on the other side to cable manage all the stuff I have
25-03-2019T18:27:02,QuinnMalachite,"It's becoming very popular nowadays, cases are making more room for fans on the front, and hard drives don't need cooling"
25-03-2019T18:27:05,anonlooker,The interior of Nora 3.0 is clean and spacious compare to whatever I'm looking to its left.
25-03-2019T18:27:31,Bgrmystr2,yeah SSDs and stuff don't really get all that hot from what I hear
25-03-2019T18:27:36,Bgrmystr2,I know HDDs still do though
25-03-2019T18:27:41,QuinnMalachite,"Yeah, case manufacturers have discovered that an extra inch in width is worth it"
25-03-2019T18:28:02,QuinnMalachite,"HDD's can get hot, but they rarely need to be placed in front of all the fans"
25-03-2019T18:28:12,anonlooker,"So what have you done with the GTX 970, Tom?"
25-03-2019T18:28:21,Bgrmystr2,"mine get supremely hot, so having a fan helps"
25-03-2019T18:28:21,CrRAR,What’s crazier is if you can get away with a blazing m.2 you don’t even need cables to it anymore.
25-03-2019T18:28:29,Bgrmystr2,ikr Cr
25-03-2019T18:28:32,Twokinds,That's actually what's in here.
25-03-2019T18:28:35,Twokinds,There's only m.3
25-03-2019T18:28:40,Twokinds,m.2*

25-03-2019T18:28:56,Bgrmystr2,you running NVME tom?
25-03-2019T18:29:05,Bgrmystr2,"those are lightning fast, way faster than SSDs"
25-03-2019T18:29:06,Twokinds,Yup!
25-03-2019T18:29:11,Bgrmystr2,daaaaaamn :ptv-excited:
25-03-2019T18:29:24,Bgrmystr2,that is some saucy hardware
25-03-2019T18:29:31,CrRAR,"Yeah, with those hitting 512 - 1TB ya don’t need anything else nowadays."
25-03-2019T18:29:50,QuinnMalachite,m.2 is seriously nice
25-03-2019T18:29:50,CrRAR,Saucy indeed lol
25-03-2019T18:29:54,Bgrmystr2,"well, unless you wanna store like 4+ TB of data, Cr lol"
25-03-2019T18:29:58,Bgrmystr2,then yeah you need a bit of extra
25-03-2019T18:30:13,CrRAR,Get a NAS xD
25-03-2019T18:30:14,Twokinds,Cost a pretty penny but I wanted the fastest drive I could afford.
25-03-2019T18:30:27,QuinnMalachite,"it's more expensive than even SSD, but it bypasses the SATA system entirely"
25-03-2019T18:30:33,QuinnMalachite,it's right on the bus
25-03-2019T18:30:57,Bgrmystr2,yeah they're mindbogglingly fast.
25-03-2019T18:31:17,Twokinds,"Yeah, no more SLOW ssd's pff"
25-03-2019T18:31:27,Bgrmystr2,"I've never had an SSD myself, but I can understand how much faster they are.. NVME I can't actually comprehend."
