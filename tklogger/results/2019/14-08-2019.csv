14-08-2019T15:40:34,AspiringNoodle,Respawn... please don't make me go play Fortnite
14-08-2019T15:40:40,TeapotOfDoom,why?
14-08-2019T15:40:51,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
14-08-2019T15:40:54,AspiringNoodle,They brought back the Kitsune skin with a recolor / minor design alterations
14-08-2019T15:40:57,TeapotOfDoom,Hi Terra!
14-08-2019T15:41:01,AspiringNoodle,And Respawn is going full EA this event
14-08-2019T15:41:05,AspiringNoodle,"Also brb, bathroom"
14-08-2019T15:41:13,TeapotOfDoom,back in a sek too
14-08-2019T15:41:17,Sclimshady,Hi Terra o/
14-08-2019T15:41:21,TerraTheWizard,hihi
14-08-2019T15:46:56,AspiringNoodle,Back
14-08-2019T15:47:08,AspiringNoodle,So Fortnite has been really consistent with their cosmetics / battle pass
14-08-2019T15:47:50,AspiringNoodle,"While stuff may be overpriced given what they are, the game is free to play and they are rather generous with the stuff they give you (especially with a battle pass)"
14-08-2019T15:48:27,AspiringNoodle,"But the Iron Crown event from Apex Legends... talk about ""Set sail for the high seas and grab yer harpoons, matey!"""
14-08-2019T15:52:06,AspiringNoodle,YongYea's take on the Iron Crown Event: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUQ8n9AruVk
14-08-2019T15:52:20,AspiringNoodle,"Rather just leave that than ""WALL OF TEXT!!!"" chat for the millionth time"
14-08-2019T16:04:40,TeapotOfDoom,back as well
14-08-2019T16:05:06,TeapotOfDoom,my schoes went from lookin completely trashed to something i could wear in a business casual setting
14-08-2019T16:05:43,TeapotOfDoom,to be fair they went from lookin semi usable to completely trashed after i cleaned them
14-08-2019T16:05:43,Sclimshady,Nice
14-08-2019T16:06:56,TeapotOfDoom,also sclim it seams i went a bit overboard with how good the fronius stuff is. talked to a friend and he said they would probably not survive the conditions you described
14-08-2019T16:07:50,TeapotOfDoom,yeah well a little (actually a heckin lot) polish seems to go a long wasy
14-08-2019T16:08:18,Sclimshady,Just use an entire tin of polish
14-08-2019T16:08:39,TeapotOfDoom,also ima try vectorising the maren-nib
14-08-2019T16:09:08,Sclimshady,Naren or Mibbs
14-08-2019T16:09:19,TeapotOfDoom,maren in nibbly-form
14-08-2019T16:09:45,Sclimshady,I guess Mibbs would be more appropriate
14-08-2019T16:10:03,Sclimshady,Naren would be Nibbs in Marens body
14-08-2019T16:10:18,TeapotOfDoom,these are confusing times
14-08-2019T16:10:48,TeapotOfDoom,i meant the completely shocked maren in nibblys body seeing nibbs in her body snuggle sythe
14-08-2019T16:11:10,TeapotOfDoom,i wanna have that shocked squirrel out of context on a tshirt lol
14-08-2019T16:11:13,Sclimshady,The only thing we know for sure is that we know nothing for sure
14-08-2019T16:11:21,TeapotOfDoom,true dat
14-08-2019T16:11:48,Sclimshady,I love how obvious it is that it's Maren in Nibbs body
14-08-2019T16:12:08,TeapotOfDoom,lol what the heck... anyone ever listened to stuff from renard before? i've got an album mix running and that stuff can get heckin funky. the track just went from continuous music to straight up saying suck ma balls wtf
14-08-2019T16:12:25,TeapotOfDoom,the hair style seems to follow her
14-08-2019T16:13:49,Sclimshady,"Never heard of them,  a fun band is neckbeard deathcamp"
14-08-2019T16:14:12,Sclimshady,Some real weird stuff in their albums
14-08-2019T16:14:57,TeapotOfDoom,neckbeard deathcamp xD now that's a name for you
14-08-2019T16:15:21,Sclimshady,"Look up the song names, it gets better/worse"
14-08-2019T16:18:36,Sclimshady,"How am I getting calls about my vehicle warranty?  My newest vehicle is 25 years old, I don't have a warranty"
14-08-2019T16:19:41,TeapotOfDoom,i dunno seems kinda like a scam to me
14-08-2019T16:20:02,TeapotOfDoom,i seem to only talk in memes today
14-08-2019T16:20:23,Sclimshady,"It is,  I have never purchased from a dealer and pay cash everytime"
14-08-2019T16:20:48,TeapotOfDoom,also the hell is that music it's just a group of people grinding into their instruments and someone growling with a whackton of reverb
14-08-2019T16:20:54,Sclimshady,Memes are a universal language
14-08-2019T16:21:25,TeapotOfDoom,is that grindcore?
14-08-2019T16:21:35,Sclimshady,"Its Metal,  I dont get the screamy stuff but the names are fun"
14-08-2019T16:22:15,Sclimshady,I like Metal bands like Volbeat and such because of the better vocals
14-08-2019T16:22:15,TeapotOfDoom,XXL ObersturmfÃ¼hrer Leather Duster
14-08-2019T16:22:21,TeapotOfDoom,what the hell
14-08-2019T16:22:40,Sclimshady,"No clue, but it's different"
14-08-2019T16:23:10,TeapotOfDoom,i know volbeat but never been something that appealed to me that much
14-08-2019T16:23:42,TeapotOfDoom,i like kraftklub a lot. more rock then metal also german lyrics but all in all really cool stuff they put out
14-08-2019T16:24:49,Sclimshady,As long as it's good the language doesn't mater too much to me
14-08-2019T16:28:41,TeapotOfDoom,turns out trying to vectorise a painted image doesn't work that well
14-08-2019T16:29:17,TeapotOfDoom,damn i don't have my tablet
14-08-2019T16:29:26,TeapotOfDoom,:ctwokinds-keifacepalm:
14-08-2019T16:30:16,Sclimshady,Makes sense.
14-08-2019T16:31:15,TeapotOfDoom,ok just no. need tablet for this
14-08-2019T16:32:00,Sclimshady,I learned the hard way you can't use a tablet in autocad.  Which is sad
14-08-2019T16:32:38,TeapotOfDoom,tablet in autocad?
14-08-2019T16:33:26,Sclimshady,It just makes the lines wig out
14-08-2019T16:35:03,TeapotOfDoom,i just noticed why my internet was having hickups
14-08-2019T16:35:17,TeapotOfDoom,i plugged into the wrong cable... me stupid
14-08-2019T16:35:35,Sclimshady,Rip
14-08-2019T16:36:26,TeapotOfDoom,works now. who would have thought
14-08-2019T16:36:59,Sclimshady,It's probably magic
14-08-2019T16:53:27,TeapotOfDoom,well it would not be me if i didn't at least try. i think i leveled up with the pen tool
14-08-2019T16:54:26,Sclimshady,Is that why my drawings are bad?  My XP is too low?
14-08-2019T16:55:06,Sclimshady,"That was meant to be a joke, now it just seems like a good analogy"
14-08-2019T16:55:16,TeapotOfDoom,lol
14-08-2019T17:03:53,TeapotOfDoom,just inked her hair
14-08-2019T17:04:09,TeapotOfDoom,it took me till now just for the freaking hair
14-08-2019T17:04:35,Sclimshady,Lol
14-08-2019T17:05:24,Sclimshady,My current drawing has like 20 hours in and its only inked and I forgot the tail so I have to add that
14-08-2019T17:06:27,TeapotOfDoom,well seems we're both doomed
14-08-2019T17:06:51,TeapotOfDoom,once i sense a challenge it's over
14-08-2019T17:07:34,Sclimshady,"I know, I want it done before Purplelemons opens comms so ive only got like two weeks to finish"
14-08-2019T17:07:50,TeapotOfDoom,why the hurry?
14-08-2019T17:08:19,Sclimshady,His comms open in september and I want one
14-08-2019T17:08:50,Sclimshady,I need it as a ref for him

14-08-2019T18:18:30,Sclimshady,"That is really good, especially with a mouse"
14-08-2019T18:18:51,TeapotOfDoom,there's still a lot to go. this stuff is vectorised so not brush based as toms stuff normally is
14-08-2019T18:19:42,TeapotOfDoom,thanks ^^ here you can see why the lines are so precise: https://paste.pics/6e593c0fcdb6d489d7ad25218708f95d
14-08-2019T18:20:04,Sclimshady,Nifty
14-08-2019T18:20:10,TeapotOfDoom,every line is its own path shape
14-08-2019T18:20:45,TeapotOfDoom,so a loooot of work. but i already did worse stuff ^^ vectorised an entire cnc mill as a comic for my company
14-08-2019T18:21:11,Sclimshady,That seems like too much work
14-08-2019T18:21:18,TeapotOfDoom,3 months to be precise
14-08-2019T18:21:35,TeapotOfDoom,but mostly in my freetime once a week for 3 hours
14-08-2019T18:21:41,TeapotOfDoom,so not that bad
14-08-2019T18:22:32,TeapotOfDoom,thing is tho i have to clean up some stuff i can't use the sketch 1:1
14-08-2019T18:22:38,TeapotOfDoom,so that's gonna be fun...
14-08-2019T18:22:44,TeapotOfDoom,anyway ima head to bed

14-08-2019T23:31:46,AspiringNoodle,4 days into retail: industry summed as thus
14-08-2019T23:32:05,AspiringNoodle,regular staff boned. Managers also boned but somewhat well compensated
14-08-2019T23:32:14,AspiringNoodle,Corporate makes all the money?
