20-05-2019T00:09:51,CrRAR,"Damnnit, careful dead cameras are a legit horror movie trope"
20-05-2019T00:10:00,Dadrobit,Downside of being hired as a supervisor I suppose. Have to actually do the work to keep all the cogs greased.
20-05-2019T00:10:48,CrRAR,The digital age has forsaken us.
20-05-2019T00:11:03,CrRAR,Go grese up those cameras!
20-05-2019T00:11:11,Dadrobit,Only scary thing put here is how bad the javelinas smell.
20-05-2019T00:11:24,Dadrobit,Out here*
20-05-2019T00:11:33,CrRAR,Is that a type of pungent flower?
20-05-2019T00:11:57,Dadrobit,Wild pig like creature.
20-05-2019T00:12:13,CrRAR,...
20-05-2019T00:12:31,CrRAR,Just go BOtW on ‚Äòem and harvest they‚Äôre tasty meats!

20-05-2019T00:13:24,Dadrobit,I'd really like to not get my ass kicked by a dozen pissed off wild pigs.
20-05-2019T00:13:42,CrRAR,hahaha
20-05-2019T00:14:03,Bgrmystr2,just grab your trusty rubberband rockshooter or that boomerang or whatever.
20-05-2019T00:14:07,Bgrmystr2,You'll be fine.
20-05-2019T00:14:09,Bgrmystr2,I believe
20-05-2019T00:14:30,CrRAR,Boulder... just roll a boulder their way.
20-05-2019T00:14:50,Bgrmystr2,that will work terrifyingly well.. as long as you're in a round-shaped tunnel.
20-05-2019T00:14:53,Dadrobit,"I have a sharp pen, some keys, and a bodycam for the inevitable Fail Army upload."
20-05-2019T00:15:03,CrRAR,xD
20-05-2019T00:15:04,Bgrmystr2,hmm
20-05-2019T00:15:19,Bgrmystr2,The great Deku tree did not equip you very well..
20-05-2019T00:15:38,Bgrmystr2,I wish you luck.

20-05-2019T00:16:42,CrRAR,Phonecord could certainly be used to choke a few of them out.
20-05-2019T00:16:48,Dadrobit,"""Hey patrol guy, bring the truck over and honk the horn a couple times"
20-05-2019T00:16:57,Bgrmystr2,oo is it one of those curly cords?
20-05-2019T00:16:59,Bgrmystr2,those are the best
20-05-2019T00:17:18,Dadrobit,"Very curly, can confirm"

20-05-2019T00:18:18,CrRAR,Retro-chic.
20-05-2019T00:19:46,Dadrobit,"Okay, made a few phone calls, maintenance guy is on the way to fix the cameras. Phew, my work here is done."
20-05-2019T00:20:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Nothin like a crossover where the two superheroes spend time wailing on each other
20-05-2019T00:20:30,SpazztasticKiwi,ah teens
20-05-2019T00:21:16,Dadrobit,It's time for a DEATH BAAAATTTTTLLLLLLLEEEE

20-05-2019T00:27:19,Dadrobit,Did you have to retire another icon for judgemental Rose?
20-05-2019T00:28:24,SpazztasticKiwi,hey Tom
20-05-2019T00:40:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Dadro did you see the funny earlier. I was reading a guys tell secrets somesuch article
20-05-2019T00:42:42,Dadrobit,"Some of it, it was the conversation that was happening when I left for work. Sounded like it came from an Ask Reddit topic from a while back."
20-05-2019T00:43:55,SpazztasticKiwi,‚Äúour boners don‚Äôt always mean we‚Äôre horny..‚Äù thing
20-05-2019T00:44:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Facebook actually
20-05-2019T00:44:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Lots of that stuf crops up on my feed. And I‚Äôve resigned to the fact I‚Äôm not much bother by such stuff anymore
20-05-2019T00:45:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Adult stuff‚Äôs funny as hell when you can snigger at the opposite sex‚Äôs problems
20-05-2019T01:02:35,AspiringNoodle,"Spazztastic, you ever see that video of a Japenese man getting a boner at the worst time? xD"
20-05-2019T01:02:48,AspiringNoodle,And I do mean the WORST time
20-05-2019T01:18:14,SpazztasticKiwi,No
20-05-2019T01:18:57,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve seen the Japanese guy dance naked in front of a pendulum which is conveniently censoring everything
20-05-2019T01:19:20,SpazztasticKiwi,As I‚Äôve learned though most times are inconvenient for men
20-05-2019T02:37:35,SpazztasticKiwi,and I‚Äôve discovered most ladies don‚Äôt find it an insult since it‚Äôs not easily controlled. Or controlled at all really
20-05-2019T02:37:45,SpazztasticKiwi,but üõå

20-05-2019T06:06:27,FloofyCat,The plot thickens... now a week unless we cut away to some other characters which is all cool too because everything TK is cool.
20-05-2019T06:07:42,FloofyCat,Such a good cliffhanger :p I'm more excited than this than the cliffhanger from infinity war
20-05-2019T06:07:52,FloofyCat,more excited from this*
20-05-2019T06:26:12,CrimsonQuill,"I think the tragedy is that Raine is among the least racist of anyone besides amnesia Trace, but she's incredibly racist...towards herself."
20-05-2019T06:26:43,CrimsonQuill,"She wants humans and Keidran to be able to coexist, and sees them as people rather than animals, as friends..."
20-05-2019T06:27:00,CrimsonQuill,"But she imagines herself being a keidran to be a curse, something to be avoided..."
20-05-2019T06:27:23,CrimsonQuill,"And in her fear, she's inadvertantly insulting Roselyn, who in turn is becoming hurt and resentful..."
20-05-2019T06:27:56,CrimsonQuill,"Plus her partially warped mindset means that her offered solution, even if it has a test behind it, might not be the best one."
20-05-2019T06:28:41,CrimsonQuill,"It's clear that they both need some development-Roselyn needs to be a bit less strict, and Raine needs to realise that she doesn't have a curse, and to accept herself and her ability as is."

20-05-2019T13:08:13,CrimsonQuill,Comic Con?
20-05-2019T13:08:20,CrimsonQuill,As in London Expo?

20-05-2019T13:48:08,TerraTheWizard,"it's not the only one, it's just the biggest"
20-05-2019T13:48:12,TerraTheWizard,mcm london

20-05-2019T13:49:08,TerraTheWizard,"there's also a not-that-small-but-still-kinda-small in cardiff, dunno who hosts that though"
20-05-2019T13:52:06,Kitty95,"there all owned by the same company so i just categorise them as the same comic con.  I know of a few local ones but there attendee never go above 1000 so doesn't quite compare. I would love to go to an American one though, must be insane!"
20-05-2019T13:53:17,TerraTheWizard,iirc the tickets for san diego comicon sell out in like 2 hours
20-05-2019T13:53:28,CrimsonQuill,I can't go to SDCC anyhow.
20-05-2019T13:53:39,CrimsonQuill,Flights'd be far to expensive alone.
20-05-2019T13:53:47,CrimsonQuill,And as for the actual ticket and spending...
20-05-2019T13:54:02,CrimsonQuill,Which sucks because I really want to go.
20-05-2019T13:57:52,TerraTheWizard,i'm planning on going to anthrocon

20-05-2019T14:05:30,CrimsonQuill,I hope so.

20-05-2019T14:35:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm not right on getting s4. It kinda died for me after 2
20-05-2019T14:36:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Watching Mark try it was fun though
20-05-2019T14:36:57,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs just been given too much work to do in it
20-05-2019T14:37:05,TerraTheWizard,"yaeh, they put most of the content into the $400 of dlc"
20-05-2019T14:44:49,SpazztasticKiwi,"Oh yea - Tom, since you stuck it out and did a dr visit, think you‚Äôll brave a dentist check?"
20-05-2019T15:27:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Told Bagheera he had suck balance for a cat and he left
20-05-2019T15:35:20,Twokinds,"I should see my dentist soon, yeah."

20-05-2019T15:39:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Clearly you‚Äôve never had any surgery
20-05-2019T15:40:35,SpazztasticKiwi,And Bagheera paid me back for my comment. I‚Äôm 99% sure he dipped his tail in my cup on purpose to splatter me in the face
20-05-2019T15:57:43,Twokinds,I've had my wisdom teeth pulled
20-05-2019T15:57:50,CrimsonQuill,Ouch.
20-05-2019T15:58:24,CrimsonQuill,Watching your brother getting his removed told me that it hurts a lot.
20-05-2019T15:58:28,CrimsonQuill,You alright?
20-05-2019T16:05:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Pulled. At least they didn‚Äôt have to be cut out
20-05-2019T16:06:16,CrimsonQuill,Ah.
20-05-2019T16:06:26,CrimsonQuill,Not quite as bad then.
20-05-2019T16:06:36,SpazztasticKiwi,They didn‚Äôt even offer to let me keep em. Mark said he tossed his out once he was fully conscious
20-05-2019T16:07:07,CrimsonQuill,Is it expensive for one to have one's wisdom teeth removed?
20-05-2019T16:07:27,SpazztasticKiwi,No clue. Never got a bill but it‚Äôs likely
20-05-2019T16:08:04,SpazztasticKiwi,"Tooth cleaning, exam, & xray is $100 ish here"
20-05-2019T16:08:29,SpazztasticKiwi,A filling can be the sameish depending how big it is
20-05-2019T16:10:20,SpazztasticKiwi,How was it?
20-05-2019T16:14:07,FloofyCat,I moved away from my dentist and haven't seen them or a new one...

20-05-2019T16:24:24,FloofyCat,"If we're going tactical I'd imagine Kat is going to have a major dry spell in the next sketch Sunday because she got so much this one, I'd imagine there will be a Keith/Natani/Laura rebound with some of Team Raine/Red/Maren/Karen/Sythe etc"
20-05-2019T16:24:34,TerraTheWizard,"""Raine and Maren on a daytrip to the Statue of Liberty."""
20-05-2019T16:25:05,CrimsonQuill,Oh.
20-05-2019T16:25:27,FloofyCat,I'm voting for Team A and Team B interactions if they come up though.
20-05-2019T16:25:32,CrimsonQuill,Is it sad that I can point out where most of the fan shippings in the comic began by their pages and panel numbers/
20-05-2019T16:25:33,CrimsonQuill,?
20-05-2019T16:26:21,TerraTheWizard,no
20-05-2019T16:26:26,FloofyCat,"Raine/Maren/Karen/Red meets Kat/Evals/Mike/Eric and stuff, basically people who haven't met in the main comic on-screen yet meeting and such and how they think of each other."
20-05-2019T16:26:40,FloofyCat,no it ain't that's more like a power
20-05-2019T16:27:08,CrimsonQuill,"We haven't really seen that much interaction between the teams as is yet, to be frank...it'll probably happen soon enough."
20-05-2019T16:27:33,CrimsonQuill,I'm wondering is Tom going to stick to the Raine identity crisis story this week or switch to someone else?
20-05-2019T16:27:41,CrimsonQuill,This comic has me so addicted...
20-05-2019T16:27:42,FloofyCat,"No idea what is planned, tbh I'd just love everyone talking to each other for a month but the plot wont progress."
20-05-2019T16:27:56,FloofyCat,"Yeah, same here Quill its a great cliffhanger 13/10 would hang off cliff again."
20-05-2019T16:28:14,FloofyCat,Its the perfect cutaway point to another group.
20-05-2019T16:28:31,CrimsonQuill,"It's very good that Raine herself is having her own flaws pointed out. I love her as a character, but she does need to stop seeing her ability as a curse."
20-05-2019T16:28:37,CrimsonQuill,I blame her mum for that mindset.
20-05-2019T16:29:01,CrimsonQuill,"It's really heartbreaking that she has no racism towards other keidran, but is racist towards herself..."
20-05-2019T16:29:25,FloofyCat,Its sad but its good its in the comic to stop it all being sunshine and rainbows.
20-05-2019T16:29:30,CrimsonQuill,"She's afraid of herself, and tries to rationalise her ability into a seperate thing...Not the best strategy."
20-05-2019T16:29:42,CrimsonQuill,But she'll develop...and grow stronger for it.
20-05-2019T16:29:57,FloofyCat,We'll get some revelations if she tries the collar :p
20-05-2019T16:30:27,CrimsonQuill,Maybe Rose doesn't actually expect her to try it on.
20-05-2019T16:30:35,CrimsonQuill,I've been trawling through the forum posts.
20-05-2019T16:30:45,FloofyCat,Is it particularly active?
20-05-2019T16:30:53,CrimsonQuill,Some people think it's a test to see just how far Raine is willing to go.
20-05-2019T16:31:30,CrimsonQuill,"Meh, I just click on 'forums' 'comic discussion'-a few new posts today. Dadrobit put a word in at some point."
20-05-2019T16:32:20,FloofyCat,I think its an attempt by Rose to forcefully expose her to what it's like to be a Keidran.
20-05-2019T16:32:57,CrimsonQuill,Doesn't make sense considering Raine already spent over a week or two like that before she got to the estate.
20-05-2019T16:33:28,FloofyCat,Well she hasn't really accepted it and like you said is scared
20-05-2019T16:34:30,FloofyCat,"If she ends up understanding what it is like to be a Keidran, or at least what it is like to be a Keidran around humans, she might either become terrified of it or make some sort of peace with it."
20-05-2019T16:34:48,FloofyCat,"Idk I think Rose's plan, whatever it is, has the potential of massively backfiring."
20-05-2019T16:34:52,CrimsonQuill,She already knows what it's like...I think Rose is just trying (in her own overbearing way) to accept that her keidran side is a part of her.
20-05-2019T16:35:21,CrimsonQuill,And Tom said that Rose might not have the best method given that living with Evil Trace may have warped her mindset a bit.
20-05-2019T16:35:47,FloofyCat,^ Either that or to reject the Keidran side as just a tool/illusion.
20-05-2019T16:36:23,FloofyCat,I really need to re-read the entire comic again before speculating because I'm probably missing things out.
20-05-2019T16:36:47,CrimsonQuill,"The core is that Raine needs to stop being afraid of herself, and to accept who she is-all three ways-Keidran, Halfway, Human."
20-05-2019T16:37:01,CrimsonQuill,That she isn't any less or more as any of them.
20-05-2019T16:37:26,FloofyCat,Tbh I'm very curious to see what the slave collar is like.
20-05-2019T16:37:28,CrimsonQuill,"Heck, even Red said that he doesn't care if she has fur and a tail as long as he knows that it's her."
20-05-2019T16:37:43,FloofyCat,And a firsthand description from Raine if it actually works.
20-05-2019T16:37:55,CrimsonQuill,It's all too much suspense!#
20-05-2019T16:38:11,CrimsonQuill,I worry about the third floor however.
20-05-2019T16:38:13,SpazztasticKiwi,no methhead came after me so sense says the stuffs abandoned
20-05-2019T16:38:27,CrimsonQuill,@SpazztasticKiwi ???
20-05-2019T16:38:40,FloofyCat,I'm more excited for next week than I was for Game of Thrones episode 6 and Endgame :(
20-05-2019T16:39:31,SpazztasticKiwi,how hard is that to follow
20-05-2019T16:40:11,CrimsonQuill,"I don't really understand what you're saying, Spazz. Sorry."
20-05-2019T16:41:45,SpazztasticKiwi,i walk on property. old trail. unknown tent. i go back
20-05-2019T16:41:59,CrimsonQuill,Ok.... I seee.
20-05-2019T16:42:11,CrimsonQuill,Thanks.
20-05-2019T16:43:37,Bgrmystr2,lol Quill you were there when she came on earlier about the tent. You were there for context and still didn't get it xD
20-05-2019T16:43:39,Bgrmystr2,10/10
20-05-2019T16:44:15,CrimsonQuill,"Sorry, I didn't realise the context, Also evening Bgr"
20-05-2019T16:44:23,Bgrmystr2,Hello
20-05-2019T16:44:52,Bgrmystr2,The other night you said Karen didn't care about Raine and her issues with keidran vs human and whatever
20-05-2019T16:44:59,Bgrmystr2,and ran off to sleep
20-05-2019T16:45:10,Bgrmystr2,yeah I don't think that's exactly the case.
20-05-2019T16:45:40,Bgrmystr2,"Karen accepts raine, human, keidran, halfway, doesn't matter. Raine is still Raine. She doesn't change who she is."
20-05-2019T16:45:49,Bgrmystr2,"Karen sees that, Raine does not."
20-05-2019T16:46:37,Bgrmystr2,"So it's not that she doesn't care, it's more that she already knows it doesn't matter. It's part of her."
20-05-2019T16:47:37,CrimsonQuill,I see.
20-05-2019T16:48:00,CrimsonQuill,I do like though that even the nicest person in the comic has to overcome her own big mental block.
20-05-2019T16:48:15,Bgrmystr2,Everyone has their vices.
20-05-2019T16:48:22,CrimsonQuill,"Really, I agree 100% with Rose that her parents stunted her growth."
20-05-2019T16:48:53,CrimsonQuill,"Raine's fine with other keidran, but dislikes being one herself, because her mother drove it into her head that it's a bad thing."
20-05-2019T16:49:01,Bgrmystr2,"well, that's cuz it isn't even opinion, it's fact. Her dad left and her mom shut her in a room with no training at all."
20-05-2019T16:49:31,Bgrmystr2,that's just straight up bad parenting 101
20-05-2019T16:51:06,CrimsonQuill,"It's heartwarming however that she still tries to be nice to Rose, to Sythe, even to Zen, who tried to kill them. She doesn't see 'keidran' as much as the others. She sees 'person'."
20-05-2019T16:51:14,CrimsonQuill,She just has to apply that to herself.
20-05-2019T16:51:40,CrimsonQuill,I must have repeated that same sort of general idea in different ways too many times now here...please forgive me.
20-05-2019T16:53:04,FloofyCat,Raine and Kat could have a competition for nicest person in the comic.
20-05-2019T16:53:08,FloofyCat,Like best girl but nicest girl.
20-05-2019T16:53:21,FloofyCat,Where they both probably blush and say the other one can have the award.
20-05-2019T16:53:33,CrimsonQuill,"True, that!"
20-05-2019T16:54:03,FloofyCat,Raine and Kat having a proper meeting and a nice chat would probably be very wholesome.
20-05-2019T16:54:34,FloofyCat,"Combine the two most wholesome characters in the comic and what do you get? I dunno, probably happiness?"
20-05-2019T16:55:09,CrimsonQuill,Hopefully.
20-05-2019T16:55:13,FloofyCat,Enough happiness to wonder if this is real or if we're in the Matrix because nothing should be that wholesome the world is supposed to be dull and miserable.
20-05-2019T16:55:38,FloofyCat,The reptile overlords need to reset the simulation again
20-05-2019T16:55:51,FloofyCat,anyway my dough has risen its pizza making time \o/
20-05-2019T16:56:00,CrimsonQuill,Tell that to someone who has a lifelong toy lion friend waiting at home.
20-05-2019T16:56:02,CrimsonQuill,:)
20-05-2019T16:56:14,CrimsonQuill,Fingajar will be happy to see me again.

20-05-2019T17:33:41,Twokinds,And burritos

20-05-2019T17:34:02,CrimsonQuill,Can you have Spaghetti Tom/
20-05-2019T17:34:03,CrimsonQuill,?
20-05-2019T17:43:52,SpazztasticKiwi,there‚Äôs a keto spaghetti noodle recipe
20-05-2019T17:43:59,SpazztasticKiwi,My cousin has it if you want
20-05-2019T17:44:12,SpazztasticKiwi,how long you staying on it anyway
20-05-2019T17:53:18,SpazztasticKiwi,& there‚Äôs keto rice too
20-05-2019T17:54:59,Twokinds,...I wouldn't trust keto spaghetti or keto rice
20-05-2019T17:55:32,CrimsonQuill,I don't even know what Keto is...
20-05-2019T18:01:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I know she liked it but eh
20-05-2019T18:01:51,CrimsonQuill,I need to go to bed. It's midnight on an exam night...

20-05-2019T18:05:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Have you tried the bacon egg cups thing. It‚Äôs something that‚Äôs done as a cutesy or instagram thing but it‚Äôs keto

20-05-2019T23:01:56,SpazztasticKiwi,"Besides, it was PhillyD. Not tabloids and who got a boob job this time junk"
20-05-2019T23:02:33,AspiringNoodle,"Well, let's see, US presidents must be at least 35 years old, but Keidrans have a life-span that's only a 1/3 of that of humans."
20-05-2019T23:02:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh boy standing made the headache worse
20-05-2019T23:03:05,AspiringNoodle,"So if we wanted to avoid being speciest, we'd need to drop that requirement for them to 11.5 at minimum."
20-05-2019T23:03:48,SpazztasticKiwi,An 11 year old president. Not to point out the obvious but we‚Äôve got that already
20-05-2019T23:04:06,AspiringNoodle,I blame Twitter.
20-05-2019T23:04:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Besides could Kat handle the press conferences
20-05-2019T23:04:29,SpazztasticKiwi,She doesn‚Äôt seem to do well under pressure
20-05-2019T23:04:29,AspiringNoodle,And Kathrin is the only one who could fix Twitter :D
20-05-2019T23:08:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I even tried to ignore the headache hoping it‚Äôd leave with some mindless YT. Nope
20-05-2019T23:08:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Not even the funny runs it off
20-05-2019T23:09:06,AspiringNoodle,"If you ever need drugs, you could always use the most powerful OTC combination out there :p"
20-05-2019T23:10:29,SpazztasticKiwi,My bathroom stays stocked with tylonal & ibuprofen
20-05-2019T23:10:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Among other meds. Meds ain‚Äôt the problem. It‚Äôs just here to stay
20-05-2019T23:12:03,Bgrmystr2,"I find that tylenol doesn't do shit for my headaches, but aleve does."
20-05-2019T23:12:25,SpazztasticKiwi,There‚Äôs no Alec‚Äôs. We don‚Äôt use it

20-05-2019T23:12:51,Bgrmystr2,should get some then
20-05-2019T23:12:58,Bgrmystr2,it's a good alternative.
20-05-2019T23:13:10,Bgrmystr2,not every drug works on everyone
20-05-2019T23:13:21,AspiringNoodle,"If ibuprofen + acetaminophen won't do anything for your headache, you might need stronger stuff"
20-05-2019T23:13:24,Bgrmystr2,"and the more you use a drug, the less effect it will have on you."
20-05-2019T23:14:27,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt use meds for every headache. Normal ones usually aren‚Äôt bed
20-05-2019T23:14:42,SpazztasticKiwi,They pass quick or with a coke
20-05-2019T23:15:23,SpazztasticKiwi,But it‚Äôs like once every blood moon or some shite these pop up like ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù
20-05-2019T23:15:36,AspiringNoodle,"Ah, a person who understands patience <3"
20-05-2019T23:15:59,Bgrmystr2,most people do? lol
20-05-2019T23:16:06,SpazztasticKiwi,It may be how I woke up so much last night. Not good sleep
20-05-2019T23:16:11,AspiringNoodle,Have you seen our culture of instant gratification? haha
20-05-2019T23:16:20,Bgrmystr2,Yes I have.
20-05-2019T23:16:28,Bgrmystr2,everyone has some level of paitence.
20-05-2019T23:17:03,AspiringNoodle,Spending 8 hours finish a drawing levels of patience?
20-05-2019T23:17:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Mine depends on the person I‚Äôm dealing with and the quality of their conversation
20-05-2019T23:17:31,AspiringNoodle,What's your take on logical fallacies?
20-05-2019T23:17:54,AspiringNoodle,Had a lovely conversation in a stream the other day about computer hardware.  Others resorted to ad hominems >_>
20-05-2019T23:18:29,SpazztasticKiwi,"If you‚Äôre trying to tell me something obviously more my field, or just plain wrong, bye bye"

20-05-2019T23:19:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm sure neon could increase the depression
20-05-2019T23:19:46,Bgrmystr2,"lol noodle I was saying that it takes a certain level of paitence, moreso than other people have, to actually see that even those who demand instant gratification have some patience."
20-05-2019T23:20:09,Bgrmystr2,It requires a deeper look. All the depth.
20-05-2019T23:20:12,Ordithus,"Neon is good at turning things up to 11, yeah"
20-05-2019T23:20:41,AspiringNoodle,That's some food for thought.  I think I :ptv-sleepy: now.
20-05-2019T23:20:56,AspiringNoodle,Need to get my sleep schedule back on track... at least until Thursday
