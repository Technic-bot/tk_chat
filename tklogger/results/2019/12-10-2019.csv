12-10-2019T15:37:55,Kynum,oh no.
12-10-2019T15:38:02,Kynum,"a castaway, and an assassin x3"
12-10-2019T15:38:08,ThingsAreMoving,"I know, hence the :ctwokinds-smug:"
12-10-2019T15:38:14,ThingsAreMoving,worth a try though
12-10-2019T15:38:22,BadFoMo,Keith = Clovis?
12-10-2019T15:38:31,Kynum,ooo!
12-10-2019T15:38:34,microbuss,well I didn't hafta mow today yay
12-10-2019T15:38:35,Kynum,clovis! that's it.
12-10-2019T15:38:39,Dimensional,Keith and CLovis body swap? XD
12-10-2019T15:38:53,Dimensional,Or Nora's magic turns him into Clovis' body double?
12-10-2019T15:39:03,PalmettoPathfinder1,I voted for the Power Rangers suggestion too.  Wish cosplay suggestions would have a better chance of winning.
12-10-2019T15:39:11,RimaDraws,yea me too
12-10-2019T15:39:36,Sclimshady,I feel like cosplays rely on people being fans
12-10-2019T15:39:50,IronHorseComics,ya think?
12-10-2019T15:40:04,IronHorseComics,I never watched Stargate wich is why I never voted for that one
12-10-2019T15:40:10,ThingsAreMoving,I thought it depends on how the voting bots are programmed
12-10-2019T15:40:20,Sclimshady,Vots

12-10-2019T15:41:58,ThingsAreMoving,o/ idk
12-10-2019T15:42:05,Sclimshady,Hi IDK
12-10-2019T15:43:24,PalmettoPathfinder1,For some reason I want to see Brutus kissing Clovis.  :P
12-10-2019T15:43:27,AnuSekaniArt,Evening ^^
12-10-2019T15:43:30,Orthonox,I have never seen Stargate yet I would have voted for that as number one because it looked so cool and I like seeing the main cast together.
12-10-2019T15:43:59,PalmettoPathfinder1,I was hoping to see Natani wearing a Jaffa suit in that Stargate suggestion.  :D
12-10-2019T15:44:06,AnuSekaniArt,yeee the Stargate one was awesome
12-10-2019T15:44:11,FloofyCat,I haven't figured out what Natani is dressed as yet pfft
12-10-2019T15:44:17,ZoopBoopLoop,Keith is wondering why he feels so bouncy under his robe
12-10-2019T15:44:20,AnuSekaniArt,We shall see :P
12-10-2019T15:44:31,ZoopBoopLoop,It's probably justa Zombie
12-10-2019T15:44:33,PalmettoPathfinder1,But that Stargate suggestion was awesome.
12-10-2019T15:44:52,BadFoMo,Natani = Keith after losing a fight?
12-10-2019T15:45:50,Ordithus,Keith's worst fear: a ded Natani
12-10-2019T15:45:51,Orthonox,Damn Keith. You went there with that Clovis cosplay.
12-10-2019T15:45:52,IronHorseComics,or maybe a ghost of his dead friend
12-10-2019T15:46:29,PalmettoPathfinder1,But I hope that one day someone Nova Card's Adelaide's ref sheet.
12-10-2019T15:47:08,ThingsAreMoving,"dead Laura, and Tom is going to add socks and gloves right at the end"
12-10-2019T15:48:43,RimaDraws,ill see you guys later. i am going to get homework done.

12-10-2019T15:56:28,Kynum,oh x3
12-10-2019T15:56:45,ZoopBoopLoop,I still think a gag about Keith being bouncy underneath is valid
12-10-2019T15:56:55,Twokinds,Keith's fear is losing people
12-10-2019T15:57:04,TerraTheWizard,lol zoop
12-10-2019T15:57:11,w0lfmare,I thought it was Alaric

12-10-2019T15:57:28,Sclimshady,He should put them somewhere he will remember then
12-10-2019T15:57:34,PalmettoPathfinder1,I kind of want to see Natani wearing Keith's old mummy outfit.
12-10-2019T15:57:35,Ordithus,pfft
12-10-2019T15:57:36,ThingsAreMoving,lol
12-10-2019T15:57:42,Kynum,"I was like ""Natani's dead?! O_O"""
12-10-2019T15:57:50,ProsePro7,Considering Natani's lifespan that fear is kind of inevitable
12-10-2019T15:58:04,BadFoMo,Keith: Let's try something sillier. Natani: ...Trace and Flora?
12-10-2019T15:58:29,Ordithus,"Losing someone to old age is different from seeing them murdered, stabbing your father, killing your best friend, or losing your fiance, twice"
12-10-2019T15:58:51,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Natani: Okay, you still have your old mummy bandages from several years back? I'll wear that and you dress up like Nora.  Keith: Works for me."
12-10-2019T15:59:15,ProsePro7,Losing someone is losing someone the pain doesn't change
12-10-2019T15:59:45,BadFoMo,Yep...
12-10-2019T15:59:47,ThingsAreMoving,"Nah, you can at least prepare for the loss if it's gradual"
12-10-2019T16:00:14,ThingsAreMoving,Like if you know someone's gonna die in the next year you can make peace with that
12-10-2019T16:00:15,Dimensional,Something sillier: Gender Swapping.
12-10-2019T16:00:20,ZoopBoopLoop,^^
12-10-2019T16:00:28,AnuSekaniArt,XD
12-10-2019T16:00:31,PalmettoPathfinder1,Anyone besides me remembers the old mummy outfit that Ketih wore a lot time ago?  It was a Top Webcomics reward.
12-10-2019T16:00:32,ThingsAreMoving,but sudden loss is heartbreaking

12-10-2019T20:00:55,PalmettoPathfinder1,I'm not roleplaying.  I'm just being silly.  :P
12-10-2019T20:01:00,Ordithus,Same
12-10-2019T20:01:12,PalmettoPathfinder1,Hm........................Good point.

12-10-2019T20:01:55,PalmettoPathfinder1,Wonder if there are any horse Keidran.  :P   Neigh.
12-10-2019T20:02:37,Sclimshady,"I never thought foxes would be so good at surfing, I guess its a perk of being a costal fox"
12-10-2019T20:02:46,CrRAR,true
12-10-2019T20:02:48,PalmettoPathfinder1,I thought so too.
12-10-2019T20:03:08,PalmettoPathfinder1,@TwoKinds how hard is it to draw fur when you first started drawing?
12-10-2019T20:03:16,PalmettoPathfinder1,@was it
12-10-2019T20:03:22,HoverdudeXL,Maybe
12-10-2019T20:04:41,BadFoMo,I think Tom said there are only Canine and Feline Keidran races. But maybe there's a Keidrian-like race of Horses?
12-10-2019T20:04:42,steelabjur,"Let's face it, we all would have wiped out too."
12-10-2019T20:04:50,Twokinds,No

12-10-2019T20:08:00,Sclimshady,No pls
12-10-2019T20:08:01,PalmettoPathfinder1,You would think Basitins would know how to surf what with living on an island.
12-10-2019T20:08:14,Ordithus,Basitins don't know what fun is
12-10-2019T20:08:15,PalmettoPathfinder1,@IronHorseComics that would be both freaky and neat.

12-10-2019T21:52:26,RimaDraws,didn't get anything done...not feeling so hot tonight
12-10-2019T21:54:44,SpazztasticKiwi,why so grump
12-10-2019T21:55:06,SpazztasticKiwi,was it the raman
12-10-2019T21:55:12,RimaDraws,do what
12-10-2019T21:55:24,SpazztasticKiwi,take hot bath - hot cancels out the hot
12-10-2019T21:55:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom had raman
12-10-2019T21:55:36,RimaDraws,sounds fun
12-10-2019T21:56:09,CrRAR,it do
12-10-2019T21:56:13,CrRAR,"also, hi rima"
12-10-2019T21:56:18,Ordithus,wb Rima
12-10-2019T21:56:22,FloofyCat,I gotta do three nights shifts in a row
12-10-2019T21:56:24,FloofyCat,Which isn't bad buuut
12-10-2019T21:56:59,FloofyCat,It's like 4 and a half hours commute because I haven't moved yet.
12-10-2019T21:57:19,Ordithus,"each commute, or total?"
12-10-2019T21:57:24,FloofyCat,Total.
12-10-2019T21:57:31,Ordithus,"Less bad, but still bad"
12-10-2019T21:57:43,Ordithus,4 and a half one way would be BRUTAL
12-10-2019T21:57:58,FloofyCat,"So by the time I'm home, I have to sleep instantly and by the time I wake up, I gotta start the commute again."
12-10-2019T21:58:24,FloofyCat,"I'd honestly rather book a hotel, but the thing is, I can't, because I need to sleep during the day instead of the night pfft."
12-10-2019T21:58:46,Ordithus,Also hotels cost $$$
12-10-2019T21:58:56,FloofyCat,They do indeed.
12-10-2019T21:59:01,Ordithus,Work to live live to work
12-10-2019T21:59:05,RimaDraws,hi CrRAR and ord
12-10-2019T21:59:14,FloofyCat,"It'd be everything I earn the day spent there, but at least I wouldn't have to commute."
12-10-2019T21:59:16,Sclimshady,Sleep in your car
12-10-2019T21:59:32,FloofyCat,I don't have one :(
12-10-2019T21:59:47,Sclimshady,Sleep on the street
12-10-2019T22:00:03,Sclimshady,Or in a bush
12-10-2019T22:00:19,FloofyCat,Pfft
12-10-2019T22:00:20,Sclimshady,I have legitimately done that before
12-10-2019T22:00:29,Ordithus,"Animals do it, most of them don't get eaten"
12-10-2019T22:01:21,RimaDraws,most of the time
12-10-2019T22:01:35,Sclimshady,"I slept under a lemon tree yesterday, it was lovely"
12-10-2019T22:01:38,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-nibsbounce::ctwokinds-statuerawr:
12-10-2019T22:02:07,FloofyCat,Why'd ya' do that?
12-10-2019T22:02:38,Sclimshady,It was soft and I was tired
12-10-2019T22:03:45,FloofyCat,"I'd need to find a soft place, plus it'll end up getting a tad cold."
12-10-2019T22:04:00,FloofyCat,And probably rainy too.
12-10-2019T22:04:37,Sclimshady,Live somewhere less cold
12-10-2019T22:05:46,FloofyCat,"I only just started the job and I dunno if asking for tomorrow's night shift to be moved will be bad considering on one hand I'm a trainee so they won't lose much, but on the other hand, it's gunna look bad if I'm already asking for stuff to be moved."
12-10-2019T22:06:18,FloofyCat,It'd mean I could actually go to bed and get a full night's (or day in this case) sleep.
12-10-2019T22:12:55,RimaDraws,i am gonna go to bed now speaking of sleep. my headache is coming back.
12-10-2019T22:12:58,RimaDraws,night guys

12-10-2019T22:23:52,CrRAR,Darn jerk microbes
