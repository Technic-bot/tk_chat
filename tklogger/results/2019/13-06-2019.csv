13-06-2019T00:30:26,AspiringNoodle,AMD about to undercut the fact that their processors are cheaper than Intel with the fact that their motherboards are about to get a WHOLE lot more expensive.
13-06-2019T00:31:35,AspiringNoodle,+$100 to lower-end boards
13-06-2019T00:31:47,AspiringNoodle,"Not sure where the price increases end, tbh."
13-06-2019T00:33:02,Bgrmystr2,doesn't really matter if they offer better performance for half the price on the high end
13-06-2019T00:33:20,AspiringNoodle,That's true...
13-06-2019T00:33:25,Bgrmystr2,you're still saving $500+
13-06-2019T00:33:46,Bgrmystr2,or what was it.. $1000 on the 16 core?
13-06-2019T00:33:48,AspiringNoodle,"I haven't taken a look at the lower end, either.  I'm not sure if there's a point where Intel would be a good value"
13-06-2019T00:34:06,AspiringNoodle,$749 for the 3950x.  And a leaked benchmark from Geekbench has it beating the 9980XE
13-06-2019T00:34:54,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, and that thing's $2000"
13-06-2019T00:35:02,Bgrmystr2,there's a reason I was telling people not to buy computers now.
13-06-2019T00:35:11,Bgrmystr2,"wait till Ryzen, cuz this was coming a mile away"
13-06-2019T00:35:13,Bgrmystr2,anyone could see it
13-06-2019T00:35:30,AspiringNoodle,And there's rumors that we could see these new Nvidia SUPER cards mid-july
13-06-2019T00:40:24,AspiringNoodle,"Honestly, I hope that's true xD"
13-06-2019T00:40:51,AspiringNoodle,Would give me an excuse to wait and see which new processors have the highest clocks and snag a current-gen GPU at launch :P
13-06-2019T00:47:34,Bgrmystr2,I'm not worried about GPUs right now unless AMD unveils a cheaper alternative to Nvidia pulling an intel and price gouging their RTX series.
13-06-2019T00:48:24,Bgrmystr2,"I wouldn't pay more than $1000 for a video card, and it better be high end. Nvidia can shove it with their horseshit prices xD"
13-06-2019T00:49:02,Bgrmystr2,"If it's more than that, it likely isn't meant for people like us anyway"
13-06-2019T00:50:35,AspiringNoodle,"These super cards are speculated to effectively be next-gen in everything but name.  Faster memory, more cores."
13-06-2019T00:50:59,AspiringNoodle,"And they're finally gonna break out the 2070 ti, but not right away"
13-06-2019T00:59:39,Bgrmystr2,they're also gonna have super prices.
13-06-2019T00:59:57,AspiringNoodle,"Huh, I heard that the prices would remain the same :/"
13-06-2019T01:00:36,Bgrmystr2,Think paying $1200 or $1500 was bad? Had to pay $2000? I honestly expect on release to be $3000 probably.
13-06-2019T01:01:07,AspiringNoodle,That would be an EXTREMELY stupid business move.
13-06-2019T01:01:25,AspiringNoodle,The moment performance is tied to price from a static base is the moment even regular consumers will call bs.
13-06-2019T01:03:47,AspiringNoodle,"Every year or so, GPU's are moving closer and closer to the 4k60 goal with a single card.  If Nvidia fosters ill will before that mark is reached, the moment both sides reach it they're screwed."
13-06-2019T01:15:55,Bgrmystr2,They already raised the price from highest end $1000 to highest end $2000. Why do you think it'd be stupid for them to raise it another 50%? They doubled it the first time.
13-06-2019T01:16:06,Bgrmystr2,hardly out of the ballpark.
13-06-2019T01:24:11,AspiringNoodle,"I would say because people weren't happy with the price increase of RTX.  If they do it a second product-line in a row, it'll REALLY start to breed resentment."
13-06-2019T01:24:28,AspiringNoodle,And people WILL start buying AMD out of spite.
13-06-2019T01:25:20,AspiringNoodle,"From what we've seen, AMD's upcoming NAVI stuff will be the equivalent of the RTX 2070 for slightly cheaper.  Next year's cards will claw even higher."
13-06-2019T01:25:47,AspiringNoodle,Not exactly a great time to try and fleece customers even harder.
13-06-2019T01:30:52,Bgrmystr2,seems like prices of GPUs have gone down since last I looked
13-06-2019T01:32:04,AspiringNoodle,You can get RTX 2080's for $700 if you choose the right model
13-06-2019T01:32:16,AspiringNoodle,I think the black/white Gigabyte one I'm looking at is that
13-06-2019T02:30:38,SpazztasticKiwi,PhillyD did a mention on Mark‚Äôs hand in interactive storytelling on yt and even did a check in clip

13-06-2019T18:52:21,Twokinds,I'm sorry!
13-06-2019T18:52:52,RimaDraws,Well I was holding the one I had previously off because I wanted to find another one. But I think I‚Äôve run out of ideas
13-06-2019T18:58:45,SpazztasticKiwi,on a scale of 1 to Tony Stark how fried is your brain
13-06-2019T18:59:42,RimaDraws,What do you mean...
13-06-2019T18:59:59,SpazztasticKiwi,nothing important
13-06-2019T19:00:08,RimaDraws,I‚Äôm totally confused

13-06-2019T19:01:46,RimaDraws,Well you didn‚Äôt forget did you
13-06-2019T19:04:27,tehbear,I think Ive run out of ideas also. None of my Clovis suggestions have done very well. Maybe I should just keep resubmitting them
13-06-2019T19:04:52,RimaDraws,Yea my last two did bad
13-06-2019T19:05:27,tehbear,also its late and my brain is fried
13-06-2019T19:07:59,tehbear,but i dont want to sleep since music sounds so awesome right now. maybe its that im half a sleep. or these headphones are really good compared to what i normally use
13-06-2019T19:09:07,RimaDraws,I want music to listen to right now but I forgot my headphones

13-06-2019T19:36:49,Dadrobit,So far pretty well. Make decent money. The HOA and residents were all super happy to see me back. But there's a fair amount more responsibility.

13-06-2019T19:43:28,Dadrobit,Get a job in graveyard shift security. Watching black and white videos of nothing for 8-12 hours kicks everyone's ass.

13-06-2019T19:47:33,Dadrobit,The only color movement I get to watch besides the local javelinas and the odd bobcat checking out my house are the officer watch cams so I can spy on them picking their noses watching Netflix.

13-06-2019T23:37:02,FloofyCat,The parts of one panel going into parts of other panels is weirdly very cool
13-06-2019T23:37:21,Ordithus,Karen has no respect for panel boundaries
13-06-2019T23:37:25,SpazztasticKiwi,anyone who wants a cat just know: I have a laser pointer and Bagheera wants the pointer
13-06-2019T23:37:28,SpazztasticKiwi,not the dot

13-06-2019T23:38:37,FloofyCat,Tries to eat the floor to get at the dot.
