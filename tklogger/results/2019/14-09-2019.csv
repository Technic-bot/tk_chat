14-09-2019T12:26:04,CrimsonQuill,Good Evening
14-09-2019T12:50:52,RimaDraws,hallo
14-09-2019T12:51:46,CrimsonQuill,At my new Digs
14-09-2019T12:51:55,CrimsonQuill,Turns out that wifi there is broken
14-09-2019T12:52:00,CrimsonQuill,So I'm using phone data
14-09-2019T12:52:23,CrimsonQuill,Which means that I will be generally checking the chat...I probably won't see much of the stream itself.
14-09-2019T12:55:09,winrock,hi!
14-09-2019T12:57:22,CrimsonQuill,Hullo
14-09-2019T13:21:36,TeapotOfDoom,Yoyoyo

14-09-2019T13:26:27,TeapotOfDoom,you sound like ya havin a nice day ^^
14-09-2019T13:26:33,7SAM,what time is in us
14-09-2019T13:27:06,winrock,11:26 am in california
14-09-2019T13:27:09,RimaDraws,1:27 pm CST
14-09-2019T13:27:16,7SAM,thx
14-09-2019T13:27:59,TeapotOfDoom,does that already count for the bingo? xD
14-09-2019T13:28:20,TeapotOfDoom,or is it too early
14-09-2019T13:30:03,7SAM,i don`t know
14-09-2019T13:30:51,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
14-09-2019T13:31:15,TeapotOfDoom,i guess it would be to early
14-09-2019T13:41:12,SpazztasticKiwi,I wonder about all the obsession with putting every character in a bikini
14-09-2019T13:42:42,TeapotOfDoom,bikinis are cool xD
14-09-2019T13:43:32,TeapotOfDoom,also i guess the reason is the most obvious one. people think it's sexy
14-09-2019T13:44:22,TeapotOfDoom,as for maddie i think it's also seeing her embarressed
14-09-2019T13:44:52,Xexanoth,^
14-09-2019T13:45:01,TeapotOfDoom,i checked how to write embrarrassed and still messed it up
14-09-2019T13:45:08,TeapotOfDoom,well then
14-09-2019T13:45:21,Xexanoth,"pretty much that, for the rest we just want the character sheets to see em nekid :ptv-excited:"
14-09-2019T13:46:11,TeapotOfDoom,why was that so obvious i don't know...
14-09-2019T13:47:29,TeapotOfDoom,"as soon as a new character gets introduced, they're either are already female or get genderbent"
14-09-2019T13:47:53,TeapotOfDoom,"once they are female people are just like ""whoop whoop make her go nude!"""
14-09-2019T13:48:08,TeapotOfDoom,cat nora best example
14-09-2019T13:48:46,CrimsonQuill,"I want to see heartwarming scenes that make me go 'awwwww', gorgeous artworks, fun and crossovers."
14-09-2019T13:48:54,CrimsonQuill,And a little bit of awesome badassery too.
14-09-2019T13:50:44,TerraTheWizard,>I wonder about all the obsession with putting every character in a bikini
14-09-2019T13:50:51,TerraTheWizard,was gonna say we need keith in a bikini
14-09-2019T13:50:58,TerraTheWizard,but then i remembered that already happened
14-09-2019T13:51:02,TerraTheWizard,https://www.deviantart.com/twokinds/art/Hangin-With-The-Girls-638599004
14-09-2019T13:51:08,Xexanoth,Nora was nude from the get go though
14-09-2019T13:51:18,Xexanoth,so it wasn't really anything new
14-09-2019T13:54:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom has said the thing is suggesting everything that’s basically corny with a p without outright calling it that to get him to draw it
14-09-2019T14:06:58,TerraTheWizard,i ran out of serious suggestions so i'm back to silly stuff
14-09-2019T14:09:36,Xexanoth,what about cute suggestions?
14-09-2019T14:11:23,tehbear,:ctwokinds-maevecute:
14-09-2019T14:11:59,TeapotOfDoom,:ctwokinds-maevecute:
14-09-2019T14:12:38,CrimsonQuill,A person on patreon just said they don't think that a suggestion that's been in a long time is likely for picking....
14-09-2019T14:12:40,CrimsonQuill,:(
14-09-2019T14:12:40,TeapotOfDoom,also i agree with quill.
14-09-2019T14:13:11,TeapotOfDoom,counterexample: barbarian raine
14-09-2019T14:13:33,CrimsonQuill,"Yeah, but RaineXRed waterfall hasn't done so well lately..."
14-09-2019T14:13:41,CrimsonQuill,I'll get it eventually....
14-09-2019T14:13:43,CrimsonQuill,I hope
14-09-2019T14:13:58,TeapotOfDoom,otherwise you'll get good enough to do it yourself
14-09-2019T14:14:05,tehbear,:ctwokinds-keith8D:
14-09-2019T14:14:50,TeapotOfDoom,i dunno if that came across in the way i intended...
14-09-2019T14:14:56,CrimsonQuill,Weeelll...I'd like to think that Tom'd be the one to draw it
14-09-2019T14:15:10,CrimsonQuill,"Because it'll be a while before I reach his standard,"
14-09-2019T14:15:23,CrimsonQuill,And perhaps some art classes when I can afford them.
14-09-2019T14:15:48,TeapotOfDoom,you'll get it eventually in any case
14-09-2019T14:16:10,TeapotOfDoom,also i wish there would be more wholesome stuff cause i think red x raine is a wholesome ship
14-09-2019T14:16:24,CrimsonQuill,:)
14-09-2019T14:16:38,CrimsonQuill,I won't even be able to 'watch' the stream tonight per se...
14-09-2019T14:17:03,CrimsonQuill,"I mean, I can check the chat, but the stream itself will be a matter of ""unpause to check-pause again"""
14-09-2019T14:17:04,TeapotOfDoom,i mean compare it to raine x maren. it's more like how much can we get raine to blush
14-09-2019T14:17:18,CrimsonQuill,I consider that one to be purely platonic.
14-09-2019T14:17:25,TeapotOfDoom,i will provide commentary xD
14-09-2019T14:17:37,CrimsonQuill,(Wifi broke so I'm using phone data-I only have 6gb)
14-09-2019T14:17:42,CrimsonQuill,So...yeah.
14-09-2019T14:17:52,TeapotOfDoom,in comic: yes; in sketches: nnnoooooooo.....
14-09-2019T14:17:59,CrimsonQuill,Trying to be conservative.
14-09-2019T14:18:01,TeapotOfDoom,what happened?
14-09-2019T14:18:17,CrimsonQuill,At my new digs the landlady said a workman did something to the router cable
14-09-2019T14:18:31,CrimsonQuill,"Now the router is on but there is no DSL signal,"
14-09-2019T14:18:42,TeapotOfDoom,oh that's bad
14-09-2019T14:18:47,CrimsonQuill,So I have to use phone wifi hotspot for now.
14-09-2019T14:18:59,TeapotOfDoom,i guess you already checked the connection
14-09-2019T14:19:05,CrimsonQuill,Yep.
14-09-2019T14:19:29,TeapotOfDoom,is it straight up phone line or coaxial?
14-09-2019T14:19:41,CrimsonQuill,Whadya mean by 'cpaxial'?
14-09-2019T14:19:51,CrimsonQuill,I mean 'coaxial'
14-09-2019T14:20:20,CrRAR,Coaxial = cable line
14-09-2019T14:20:24,TeapotOfDoom,something like this
14-09-2019T14:20:53,TeapotOfDoom,Hi there CrRAR!
14-09-2019T14:21:01,CrRAR,Screw terminal with a single copper pin looking thing
14-09-2019T14:21:06,TeapotOfDoom,I have returned from the hike safely ^^
14-09-2019T14:21:10,CrRAR,Hellllloooo teapot!
14-09-2019T14:21:17,CrRAR,Excellente

14-09-2019T14:21:32,CrRAR,Hellllooo rima!
14-09-2019T14:21:42,CrRAR,Hellllooo crimson too
14-09-2019T14:22:00,TeapotOfDoom,although the friends my parents brought slowed us down to the point we had to take a shortcut xD
14-09-2019T14:22:16,CrRAR,Oh no
14-09-2019T14:22:42,CrRAR,At least you rekindled your connection with nature and survived.
14-09-2019T14:22:47,TeapotOfDoom,so something like this Quill?
14-09-2019T14:22:56,TeapotOfDoom,hahaha yes i have
14-09-2019T14:23:01,TeapotOfDoom,we had a lot of fun xD
14-09-2019T14:23:20,CrimsonQuill,That's the sort Teapot
14-09-2019T14:23:32,CrimsonQuill,"Something about the cable being stretched, bent or crushed."
14-09-2019T14:23:51,TeapotOfDoom,ok then i have no idea how to fix that xD sry... i guess it has to be changed then
14-09-2019T14:24:28,TeapotOfDoom,i guess you don't have access to the inhouse splitter nor a replacement cable
14-09-2019T14:25:04,CrimsonQuill,I don't know
14-09-2019T14:25:15,CrimsonQuill,The landlady hopes for the workman to come back soon
14-09-2019T14:25:23,CrimsonQuill,So that it can be fixe
14-09-2019T14:25:26,CrimsonQuill,fixed
14-09-2019T14:27:27,TeapotOfDoom,that sucks
14-09-2019T14:28:21,TeapotOfDoom,i would love to be able to help you as stuff like that is right up my alley but without being on site it's near to impossible
14-09-2019T14:29:27,TeapotOfDoom,also I started watching noodle's anime recommedation and no evil. the first one is pretty weird the second one seems weird but cool
14-09-2019T14:29:52,CrRAR,What did noodle recommend?
14-09-2019T14:31:39,CrRAR,No evil is intriguing. Those poor grapes.

14-09-2019T14:36:26,CrimsonQuill,I meant to while away my time just watching vids
14-09-2019T14:36:37,CrimsonQuill,But considering my wifi problem
14-09-2019T14:36:46,CrimsonQuill,I'm now making a castle in Minecraft.
14-09-2019T14:36:55,TeapotOfDoom,unconventional idea: read something

14-09-2019T15:26:01,AcePilotIV,Na I prefer Joyner and logic
14-09-2019T15:26:05,AnuSekaniArt,Nice ^^
14-09-2019T15:26:15,LoneWolfZitsue,Tom should create an animated series of this comic
14-09-2019T15:26:23,AcePilotIV,And I bit of  passionate MC
14-09-2019T15:26:27,AnuSekaniArt,Would be awesome but a lot of work XD
14-09-2019T15:26:30,LoneWolfZitsue,Voice actors and everything
14-09-2019T15:26:30,ThingsAreMoving,"Nah, animation takes aaaaaages"
14-09-2019T15:26:32,CrimsonQuill,Plus the voices
14-09-2019T15:26:41,CrimsonQuill,They would be a tricky thing
14-09-2019T15:26:47,ContagiousBordem16,#Tony Cryinight TwoKinds animated series
14-09-2019T15:26:49,CrimsonQuill,Not to mention headcanons would be shattered
14-09-2019T15:26:50,LoneWolfZitsue,Yea but it would be awesome
14-09-2019T15:26:53,AcePilotIV,It would be worth it though
14-09-2019T15:26:54,PalmettoPathfinder1,Careful: Disney might try to buy the rights to TK if Tom tried to do an animated comic.
14-09-2019T15:27:07,AcePilotIV,Yh
14-09-2019T15:27:07,CrimsonQuill,I for one can't imagine Keith or any Basitin without British Accents.
14-09-2019T15:27:14,CrimsonQuill,It just fits for me.
14-09-2019T15:27:16,AcePilotIV,Lol

14-09-2019T15:27:38,ThingsAreMoving,lol I just imagined Keith having a birmingham accent
14-09-2019T15:27:44,LoneWolfZitsue,😂
14-09-2019T15:27:46,ThingsAreMoving,"would suit him, the miserable chap"
14-09-2019T15:27:49,AcePilotIV,Lol
14-09-2019T15:27:59,CrimsonQuill,For me Keith's accent is a modified version of mine...
14-09-2019T15:28:04,TeapotOfDoom,That fits surprisingly well
14-09-2019T15:28:06,AcePilotIV,What bout Indian accent lmao
14-09-2019T15:28:09,PalmettoPathfinder1,I pictured Wolves with a French accent.  And tigers with a Japanese accent and Dogs with a Brooklyn accent.
14-09-2019T15:28:19,ContagiousBordem16,Natani Would have Stephanie Nadolny
14-09-2019T15:28:24,CrimsonQuill,I just fit the accent to the character
14-09-2019T15:28:29,LoneWolfZitsue,I agree with that statement
14-09-2019T15:28:30,CrimsonQuill,Whatever the logic of nationality
14-09-2019T15:28:42,AcePilotIV,Hmmmmm
14-09-2019T15:28:59,PalmettoPathfinder1,Although I can see Flora with a Southern accent.  :D

14-09-2019T15:29:32,TeapotOfDoom,Ye
14-09-2019T15:29:34,LoneWolfZitsue,Whenever I read comics I always come up with voices in my head of what they would sound lile

14-09-2019T15:29:59,AcePilotIV,Bit sad
14-09-2019T15:30:03,ThingsAreMoving,I hope for Brutus standing there with a hose and dousing Clovis with ice cold water
14-09-2019T15:30:05,TeapotOfDoom,She would still fit for the bit that is there

14-09-2019T16:06:09,FloofyCat,"I didn't think Rose was going to order Raine to attack Red (that's a lot of R) until it got pointed out, then I thought yeah that makes sense."
14-09-2019T16:06:18,unsteddyphoenix,why is a little old lady wearin heells
14-09-2019T16:06:24,AcePilotIV,Lol
14-09-2019T16:06:30,FloofyCat,So she can be a old lady
14-09-2019T16:06:31,SpazztasticKiwi,to feel young
14-09-2019T16:06:32,ThingsAreMoving,"Spazz just put up a ""careful, wet floor"" sign and stop caring"
14-09-2019T16:06:33,Xexanoth,i always thought it made more sense to put her into an embarrassing situation
14-09-2019T16:06:34,MatyMaty,"I was sure was going to be like ""kill him"""
14-09-2019T16:06:36,SpazztasticKiwi,because she can
14-09-2019T16:06:39,FloofyCat,instead of little old
14-09-2019T16:06:45,SpazztasticKiwi,because it was all that matched
14-09-2019T16:06:45,Okamiiiiiiiiii,yes
14-09-2019T16:06:49,Xexanoth,embarassment is very powerful
14-09-2019T16:06:51,SpazztasticKiwi,I didn’t exactly ask
14-09-2019T16:06:53,TeapotOfDoom,Because screw you that's why xD
14-09-2019T16:06:55,Xexanoth,anime taught me that
14-09-2019T16:07:02,unsteddyphoenix,askingfor trouble tbh but go off grandma
14-09-2019T16:07:05,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"I would have cheered, maty"
14-09-2019T16:07:07,ThingsAreMoving,Almost as powerful as shouting really loud
14-09-2019T16:07:18,Xexanoth,or spinning
14-09-2019T16:07:22,Okamiiiiiiiiii,What about punching?
14-09-2019T16:07:30,SpazztasticKiwi,there is already a wet floor sign but that’s not gonna stop a fall
14-09-2019T16:07:37,ThingsAreMoving,or having flashbacks to your childhood

14-09-2019T16:08:30,Combak,Reed is a fine character.

14-09-2019T16:08:41,CrimsonQuill,Such as a tendency to 'keep diggin that hole' with words

14-09-2019T17:42:37,AcePilotIV,Byeeee
14-09-2019T17:42:42,CrRAR,godspeed
14-09-2019T17:42:56,Ordithus,I think this is the closest Maddie and Maeve have beein in comic http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/905/
14-09-2019T17:42:59,Sammit,Bye Ace
14-09-2019T17:43:05,Ordithus,Bye ace
14-09-2019T17:43:15,FoxxTrotter,"Bye, Ace."
14-09-2019T17:43:32,Mikemkke034,Fair enough Ord
14-09-2019T17:44:44,Ordithus,:ptv-ohmy: the King!
14-09-2019T17:44:59,InTheLionsDen,It's good to be the king.
14-09-2019T17:44:59,CatzArt,hail!
14-09-2019T17:45:06,MuonNeutrino,"@Ordithus well, they did actually *almost* interact a couple strips earlier http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/903/"
14-09-2019T17:45:21,Ordithus,So close
14-09-2019T17:45:42,MuonNeutrino,"well, maddie asking about her and maeve hiding away, so they did sorta interact even if not directly XD"
14-09-2019T17:47:18,ShamusTheFox,"So, speculation time: Did Maddie have the hots for Keith and just give up on him when she saw Keith and Natani were a thing?"
14-09-2019T17:48:26,MuonNeutrino,"that's the easiest interpretation, anyway"
14-09-2019T17:48:36,MuonNeutrino,her reaction to keith the first time she saw him implies it at least
14-09-2019T17:48:45,MuonNeutrino,"but maddie has serious *layers*, so who knows"
14-09-2019T17:49:35,PalmettoPathfinder1,Would have thought this would be a full body pic. Still this is good.
14-09-2019T17:49:51,MuonNeutrino,"i do think she was at least struck by him at first. they basically didn't really interact in any way, so it can't really be more than that, but having a sort of crush isn't impossible"
14-09-2019T17:50:11,PalmettoPathfinder1,Adelaide is still sexy.
14-09-2019T17:50:17,Ordithus,The letter covered with hearts was certainly a hint
14-09-2019T17:50:59,Ordithus,... I just realized Keith and Maddie are actually only 2 years apart
14-09-2019T17:51:39,ShamusTheFox,"Yeah, the letter definitely conveyed that a bit. She never actively pursued it, other than stowing away, I think..."
14-09-2019T17:52:26,Caesarrow,Is it a third art?
14-09-2019T17:52:42,MuonNeutrino,"and that's the problem with maddie, because she blends her own personality with her infiltration so much"
14-09-2019T17:52:53,Prec1sioN,Idk if you already know this but your stream is on the front page of Picato
14-09-2019T17:52:56,MuonNeutrino,how much of it is her and how much is the role? it's hard to tell at any given time
14-09-2019T17:53:12,MuonNeutrino,"there's always some of both, but what's dominant?"
14-09-2019T17:53:23,Ordithus,The best lies are partially truth
14-09-2019T17:53:32,CrRAR,Love for Keith can't be faked.
14-09-2019T17:53:35,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-natkeith:
14-09-2019T17:53:45,MuonNeutrino,"there's likely some genuine infatuation or crush, but how much of her response is actually her and how much of it is her subsuming that into a persona?"
14-09-2019T17:54:17,MuonNeutrino,it's hard to tell
14-09-2019T17:55:07,ShamusTheFox,She definitely went into a deep cover with her little kid act.
14-09-2019T17:55:12,CrRAR,We'll now once her grand scheme is realized and she give a moving monologue.
14-09-2019T17:55:17,CrRAR,*know
14-09-2019T17:55:40,PalmettoPathfinder1,Is Adelaide leaning up against the side of the pool
14-09-2019T17:55:53,Ordithus,Maddie was the villain all along?
14-09-2019T17:56:29,CrRAR,No it's just the raw strength of those abs
14-09-2019T17:56:42,CrRAR,unlimited stamina
14-09-2019T17:57:06,CrRAR,Adelaide has made chairs obsolete
14-09-2019T17:57:07,PalmettoPathfinder1,That's true. Adelaide's abs are unsty
14-09-2019T17:57:38,AspiringNoodle,You could sharpen blades on dem abs :3
14-09-2019T17:57:41,PalmettoPathfinder1,Unstoppable
14-09-2019T17:58:49,ProsePro7,I love a talk fit woman.  Adelaide is perfect
14-09-2019T17:59:02,ProsePro7,TALL not talk damn keyboard
14-09-2019T17:59:03,Cha11engerD,Those abs are why she's King.
14-09-2019T17:59:45,Cha11engerD,"And, quite frankly, everything else about her as well."
14-09-2019T18:00:07,FoxxTrotter,"I have to head out. Later, everyone. :0)"

14-09-2019T18:00:22,Prec1sioN,Tbh she has more defined abs than some of the male characters
14-09-2019T18:00:31,AspiringNoodle,Byeeeeeee :ptv-greetings:
14-09-2019T18:00:32,Ordithus,She do
14-09-2019T18:00:59,Prec1sioN,I mean as far as I remember the isn't a pic of trace without a t shirt but all of the other ones have mostly less defined abs

14-09-2019T18:02:54,AspiringNoodle,*amgery noodling intensifies*
14-09-2019T18:03:14,MuonNeutrino,natani is very much a battlemage
14-09-2019T18:03:21,Prec1sioN,Natani is more of a Battlemage and or muderer
14-09-2019T18:03:22,CrRAR,[okay okay you can be uncontested leader]*:ctwokinds-sadtrace2:
14-09-2019T18:03:32,MuonNeutrino,trace is much more your stereotypical scrawny wizard type
14-09-2019T18:03:37,AspiringNoodle,*happy noodle noises* :ptv-hearts:
14-09-2019T18:03:37,Unenlagia,I agree with Muon
14-09-2019T18:04:01,Prec1sioN,Btw. isnt Trace really tiny too? (very untall or whatever you want to call it)
14-09-2019T18:04:11,CrRAR,PUNY

14-09-2019T18:04:40,CrRAR,(That's probably one of the masks nicknames for him)
14-09-2019T18:05:24,PalmettoPathfinder1,You know I wonder what will happen to Maddie when she is reunited with her Mom?  Not good I think.
14-09-2019T18:05:46,Ordithus,Adira isn't even in this yet and this sketch is :fire::fire::fire:
14-09-2019T18:06:02,Prec1sioN,I wonder what happens if Trace remembers more and more about his past... could get interesting
14-09-2019T18:06:09,Prec1sioN,I sort of like Evil / Edgy trace
14-09-2019T18:06:35,Xexanoth,@Ord we already got Adelaide so of course...
14-09-2019T18:06:36,CrRAR,His poor innocent mind can't handle it.
14-09-2019T18:06:56,ShamusTheFox,I think the story is building to reveal more uncomfortable truths for Trace
14-09-2019T18:07:08,CrRAR,most likely
14-09-2019T18:08:16,Prec1sioN,I think that could be really interesting... good trace is sometimes a bit too naive
14-09-2019T18:08:36,CrRAR,"Including ""You cook bad, and you always will"""
14-09-2019T18:08:41,Okamiiiiiiiiii,interesting

14-09-2019T18:10:41,ShamusTheFox,"To be perfectly honest, I hope that Trace, Flora, and Adira can live in a polyamorous relationship with Maeve being an adopted daughter and sister to Flora's child."
14-09-2019T18:11:29,RimaDraws,no
14-09-2019T18:11:31,Unenlagia,No
14-09-2019T18:11:33,RimaDraws,just no
14-09-2019T18:11:53,Xexanoth,except that in 2 years maeve is basically a late teenager compared to a 2 year old human/keidran hybrid...
14-09-2019T18:11:54,CrRAR,haha
14-09-2019T18:11:54,RimaDraws,flora and trace only need each other. don't spoil it

14-09-2019T18:22:46,MuonNeutrino,"something i wonder from time to time - for someone as floofy as adira, how do you even get a tight fitting piece of clothing like a bikini top *on* without it getting irreparably tangled up in the floof? XD"
14-09-2019T18:23:05,Ordithus,A little bit of domestic magic?
14-09-2019T18:23:22,AspiringNoodle,Magic.  Just magic.
14-09-2019T18:23:35,MuonNeutrino,sometimes i think keidran culture's nudist tendencies is a product of practicality as much as anything else XD
14-09-2019T18:23:57,AspiringNoodle,Humans wear clothes because we don't have fur all over our bodies
14-09-2019T18:24:17,AspiringNoodle,It's a way to help regulate body temperature / protect against the sun and other sourches of harm

14-09-2019T18:30:26,SageSaga,understandable but your actions will put other people in a bad mood- and its hard to do artwork when you have people pissing ya off

14-09-2019T19:17:36,CatzArt,mike and evals that was it

14-09-2019T21:37:28,SpazztasticKiwi,only reason I got my TK and suck shirts up is he would try laying on them otherwise
14-09-2019T21:37:34,SpazztasticKiwi,such

14-09-2019T21:45:09,Ordithus,The leaves are beginning to turn :fallen_leaf:
14-09-2019T21:47:23,SpazztasticKiwi,expect for his disappearing act last night Bagheera’s been good
14-09-2019T21:47:28,SpazztasticKiwi,except
14-09-2019T21:47:42,SpazztasticKiwi,my phone has dyslexia
14-09-2019T21:47:53,RimaDraws,lol
14-09-2019T21:48:33,SpazztasticKiwi,sometimes wants to call Tom “tome” or “time”
14-09-2019T21:48:43,SpazztasticKiwi,or “top”
14-09-2019T21:49:13,RimaDraws,pffft
14-09-2019T22:01:43,SpazztasticKiwi,"if I hadn’t taught it “lann”, it’s be calling him “land”"

14-09-2019T22:12:27,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-clovisgirl_shake:!!!!!
14-09-2019T22:14:04,Dadrobit,I sneezed. Oreo is very concerned.
14-09-2019T22:14:32,Ordithus,"""Is he gonna asplode?"""
14-09-2019T22:14:42,Dadrobit,Minor explosion.
14-09-2019T22:17:34,SpazztasticKiwi,cats act like you’ve insulted their ancestors when you sneeze
14-09-2019T22:17:42,SpazztasticKiwi,“why you disturb me”
14-09-2019T22:18:11,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve heard dad sneezes are quite explosive so....
14-09-2019T22:18:36,Dadrobit,I have absurdly loud sneezes.
14-09-2019T22:18:38,Okamiiiiiiiiii,wow
14-09-2019T22:18:50,Dadrobit,Hiccups as well.
14-09-2019T22:19:14,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-zenshocked:*[ :boom: ]
14-09-2019T22:22:32,Okamiiiiiiiiii,Same and so does my friend. You can hear her for miles when she sneezes
14-09-2019T22:22:48,SpazztasticKiwi,seen that video with the explosion squeaky toy?
14-09-2019T22:26:30,SpazztasticKiwi,also I came across a possibly horrible twist for D&D
14-09-2019T22:26:48,SpazztasticKiwi,tarot deck instead of dice
14-09-2019T22:28:31,Okamiiiiiiiiii,interesting. How does that work?
14-09-2019T22:32:27,SpazztasticKiwi,the dm reads the cards each player draws instead of rolling the dice and interprets what happens based on the card
14-09-2019T22:33:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"orientation, symbolism, and meaning"
14-09-2019T22:34:02,SpazztasticKiwi,this requires the dm know how to read a tarot deck of course
14-09-2019T22:35:59,Okamiiiiiiiiii,I like it.
14-09-2019T22:37:08,Dadrobit,"Seems more restrictive, while also being too loose. Numbers on a die can easily correlate with the number on a charactersheet, but are still completely open to DM interpretation and administration."
14-09-2019T22:37:53,Dadrobit,Tarot cards have no way to associate to character stats.
14-09-2019T22:38:17,Dadrobit,You'd essentially just be playing the board game Life in a fantasy setting.
14-09-2019T22:38:31,Okamiiiiiiiiii,I honestly thought it was gonna be a character specific gimick tbh. Like only this character is associated with tarot cards and the rest use dice
14-09-2019T22:39:33,Dadrobit,That.... Might be a thing? But I think it'd just be better for the player piloting the character to make that a roleplay facet rather than actual gameplay.
14-09-2019T22:40:08,Dadrobit,Like a bad roll means the character drew a deeply foreboding card.
14-09-2019T22:42:04,Okamiiiiiiiiii,I hope it is.
14-09-2019T22:46:05,SpazztasticKiwi,tarot cards do have numbers assigned to them
14-09-2019T22:46:17,SpazztasticKiwi,the Fool is #0
14-09-2019T22:47:29,SpazztasticKiwi,and each card has a good and bad interpretation depending on if it’s drawn right side up or backwards or “inverted”
14-09-2019T22:48:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"there’s also the past present and future sides of their meanings, if you want to get into that kind of reading"
14-09-2019T22:48:13,Okamiiiiiiiiii,Honestly I like this idea.
14-09-2019T22:49:27,SpazztasticKiwi,it could be fun but it would mean knowing D&D as well as the tarot
14-09-2019T22:51:55,Dadrobit,"Even if you take their number into account, that just means that they have set interpretations. Low number cards would always have to be interpreted as bad, and high cards only have good ones."
14-09-2019T22:53:28,Dadrobit,And then you'd be put into a position of having to shove mythical interpretations of cards into situations where they might just not make sense.
14-09-2019T22:54:54,Ordithus,There are a few abilities that could work really well
14-09-2019T22:55:10,Ordithus,"Some spells essentially consult with the gods, or other beings"
14-09-2019T22:55:49,Ordithus,"But to see whether a character manages to actually climb a nasty rope, nah"
14-09-2019T22:55:57,Dadrobit,"Sure, it'd be fine as an in-character role playing aspect. But as the core functionality of the game? Nah."
14-09-2019T22:56:57,Okamiiiiiiiiii,There's probably a way and I'm really curious about this. This caught my attention
14-09-2019T22:57:23,Ordithus,I do wonder if you could make a class based upon the tarot reading concept
14-09-2019T22:59:04,Okamiiiiiiiiii,There is!!!
14-09-2019T22:59:07,Okamiiiiiiiiii,I think
14-09-2019T22:59:18,Okamiiiiiiiiii,It's called a card caster
14-09-2019T22:59:38,Dadrobit,A bard that uses their charisma to convince people that card predictions are real.
14-09-2019T23:02:13,Dadrobit,"""Nah, nah, nah. See, I rolled a nat 1, usually a critical fail. But see, all things have dual interpretations! Really this interpretation of The Fool is all about new beginnings, not failure."""
14-09-2019T23:02:35,Dadrobit,"""Right, new beginnings. Roll a new character."" -The DM probably"
14-09-2019T23:02:43,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
14-09-2019T23:03:25,Okamiiiiiiiiii,I wanna make a character where after every battle you become a different character.
14-09-2019T23:03:48,Dadrobit,"Easy, find a shitty DM who lies about his dice rolls."
14-09-2019T23:04:10,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-RainezZz: nighty night
14-09-2019T23:04:13,Dadrobit,o/
14-09-2019T23:04:29,Dadrobit,Should probably head out soon-ish myself.
14-09-2019T23:04:31,Okamiiiiiiiiii,night ordithus
14-09-2019T23:04:32,Okamiiiiiiiiii,same
14-09-2019T23:12:34,SpazztasticKiwi,you missed the past present future interpretations
14-09-2019T23:13:15,SpazztasticKiwi,"and the Fool is a yes card; if applicable, the answer “should be” yes if you draw the Fool"
14-09-2019T23:14:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"while I know a good bit of the cards, I know little of D&D so there’s some work to do if integration of any kind for the deck was to happen in a game"
14-09-2019T23:14:55,SpazztasticKiwi,"based on how they and the game work, thered be some electric slide style planning to do"
14-09-2019T23:38:19,Okamiiiiiiiiii,alright goodnight y'all thanks for enlightening with some dnd ideas spazztasticKiwi
