11-06-2019T14:01:47,BadFoMo,Hmm. Guess Chapter 1 was all we had.
11-06-2019T14:02:09,TerraTheWizard,tom's been really busy with stuff
11-06-2019T14:02:28,TerraTheWizard,don't expect any new mm until at least after ac
11-06-2019T14:06:19,BadFoMo,Yeah; he has been saying how busy he has been. Don't know why I thought there was anything else in the tube.
11-06-2019T14:08:01,BadFoMo,...So what do you think the next chapter will be about?
11-06-2019T14:15:22,TerraTheWizard,maybe https://imgur.com/a/BM6jpes
11-06-2019T14:15:37,TerraTheWizard,also there was another thing i thought it could be but i lost the message
11-06-2019T14:15:42,TerraTheWizard,so i don't remember
11-06-2019T14:17:12,AspiringNoodle,Oh my :ptv-laugh:

11-06-2019T14:19:46,BadFoMo,...Better known as 'what if Saria didn't die?'?
11-06-2019T14:20:03,TerraTheWizard,that too
11-06-2019T14:20:07,TerraTheWizard,but there was another one
11-06-2019T14:20:19,TerraTheWizard,"that was mentioned in here by tom, but i lost the cap"
11-06-2019T14:22:21,BadFoMo,When was it said?
11-06-2019T14:24:38,TerraTheWizard,"middle of last year, maybe earlier"
11-06-2019T14:25:18,TerraTheWizard,tom was talking about ideas for a series of side comics
11-06-2019T14:28:52,BadFoMo,All I /think/ I remember is that Sage /might/ be working with him on a side project.
11-06-2019T14:29:57,BadFoMo,...And that it invoved that box of stuff that Evals (and Mike) stole.
11-06-2019T14:36:40,TerraTheWizard,hmmm

11-06-2019T16:17:07,Dadrobit,Reminds me to of back when I used to work at Albertsons. One of the produce managers was a decent Artis and he painted a huge grumpy cat sign advertising the pet food sales during pet appreciation month.

11-06-2019T18:19:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m definitely thinking of moving states if I someday decide to try a family
11-06-2019T18:19:45,RimaDraws,hm
11-06-2019T18:20:02,SpazztasticKiwi,These new laws are just entirely too scary
11-06-2019T18:21:56,RimaDraws,whats going on?
11-06-2019T18:25:37,SpazztasticKiwi,I want to believe it’s false or fake or whatever you want to say but there’s supposedly a woman in Georgia I believe that’s been told she’s not allowed an abortion due to the new law despite her baby not developing a skull
11-06-2019T18:25:55,RimaDraws,ok i wont get on that topic
11-06-2019T18:28:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Don’t blame you. I’m getting off the internet after that too before it gets me
11-06-2019T18:28:48,SpazztasticKiwi,just NOPE™️
11-06-2019T18:29:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ll see y’all later when I’m off at 8
11-06-2019T18:31:19,RimaDraws,okies
11-06-2019T19:12:14,AspiringNoodle,Oof...
11-06-2019T19:12:37,AspiringNoodle,This is why I'm trying to move away from politics... but it seems like no matter what it's gonna drag EVERYBODY in...

11-06-2019T19:38:53,metalman20,ayyyy how's everyone doing tonight?
11-06-2019T19:40:36,RimaDraws,hii ok
11-06-2019T19:41:01,AspiringNoodle,Decent.
11-06-2019T19:41:26,AspiringNoodle,"Watching a stream, gonna finally get through my youtube backlog (I seriously need to reevaluate how many videos I watch >_>)"
11-06-2019T19:42:47,metalman20,that's good.  and what stream are you watching noodle?
11-06-2019T19:42:51,AspiringNoodle,Picarto half-monitor stream > youtube half-monitor stream
11-06-2019T19:42:54,AspiringNoodle,ChaseTheBro :D
11-06-2019T19:43:15,AspiringNoodle,He's really good at Dark Souls and he gets ALL the booty
11-06-2019T19:43:19,AspiringNoodle,(read: backstabs)
11-06-2019T19:44:03,AspiringNoodle,"It's annoying though.  Picarto's small window stream is super intuitive.  Chat off to the side, regular streams on the opposite."
11-06-2019T19:44:31,AspiringNoodle,"Youtube decides the stream should take up the top half, chat teh bottom.  But chat is so large that you have to scroll down and cut-off the stream to engage with chat :/"
11-06-2019T19:44:39,metalman20,"i'm curious how is that annoying, it honestly doesn't seem that annoying to me"
11-06-2019T19:45:13,AspiringNoodle,"It's like... Youtube, is it too much to ask that I can watch the stream AND engage with chat?  Not pick one or the other?"
11-06-2019T19:45:14,metalman20,read the second half of your comment and i would like to retract my statement lol
11-06-2019T19:45:57,metalman20,doing both would be more beneficial
11-06-2019T19:46:09,Bgrmystr2,"erh, youtube doesn't do that for me, Noodle"
11-06-2019T19:46:21,AspiringNoodle,I hope he survives the Adpocalypse (version XX).  He streams mainly dark souls and he has over 160k subs
11-06-2019T19:46:26,Bgrmystr2,"dunno what yours looks like, but mine shows video on the left and chat on the right just like picarto and twitch"
11-06-2019T19:46:45,AspiringNoodle,I'm utilizing the half-monitor stuff from windows :P
11-06-2019T19:47:03,AspiringNoodle,"Have 2 web browsers up, each taking up half the monitor."
11-06-2019T19:47:12,AspiringNoodle,Picarto works really nicely with this.  Youtube is sub-par
11-06-2019T19:47:22,metalman20,okay that makes sense
11-06-2019T19:47:34,Bgrmystr2,"lol, no wonder your youtube did that. Ya did it to yourself, bro./"
11-06-2019T19:48:10,AspiringNoodle,"Alright, I retract my complaint"
11-06-2019T19:48:29,AspiringNoodle,"Apparently a benefit of this mode is that if you resize a window, it adjusts the size of BOTH applications ;D"
11-06-2019T19:48:45,AspiringNoodle,"Gave youtube a bit more screen space, and chat is back in a good position"
11-06-2019T19:49:12,Bgrmystr2,xD
11-06-2019T19:49:24,metalman20,hopefully work went better for you today rima
11-06-2019T19:49:31,AspiringNoodle,Now don't get me started on my effin' GPU
11-06-2019T19:51:43,Ordithus,"my lawn is... interesting.  A game of ""what on earth is that weed"""

11-06-2019T19:54:27,Ordithus,It'd be a lot easier to tell if they were in bloom
11-06-2019T19:57:14,metalman20,well it seems that they all share the same color so does your mystery look anything like it?
11-06-2019T20:01:43,Ordithus,"They're only budding at the moment, but seems a match"
11-06-2019T20:08:54,metalman20,"judging from the pictures, it seems that they look pretty nice"
11-06-2019T20:09:55,Ordithus,Maybe once they bloom!  Right now they're pretty ugly :ctwokinds-zenshocked:
11-06-2019T20:10:49,metalman20,"ouch, well hopefully it doesn't take too long for them to bloom"
11-06-2019T20:12:42,Ordithus,In the meantime I will continue the decapitation
11-06-2019T20:13:50,metalman20,the axe (clippers) shall be brought down with swift justice
11-06-2019T20:16:46,Ordithus,3100 rpm whirling steel blades
11-06-2019T20:16:52,Ordithus,of justice
11-06-2019T20:18:33,metalman20,that's a flower's version of a horror film
11-06-2019T20:20:25,AspiringNoodle,Aw man... there's a horror movie that describes that perfectly...
11-06-2019T20:22:56,metalman20,what would that be?
11-06-2019T20:23:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I wear 32x32 men’s pants
11-06-2019T20:23:25,AspiringNoodle,"Cursory google gave me The Mangler.  Literally killer machines possessed by demons.  Not what I was thinking of, but close enough."

11-06-2019T20:24:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m probably still gonna get something bigger to keep. Just for the concept of giving my butt breathing room
11-06-2019T20:25:35,AspiringNoodle,My butt will get breathing room when it decides to lose some weight
11-06-2019T20:25:44,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl: nice kiwi
11-06-2019T20:31:21,metalman20,great job kiwi. and it's always great to have some butt breathing room.

11-06-2019T20:46:10,SpazztasticKiwi,I stop the car to look at an unknown lump on the road and the bird thanks me by flying up in my face and nearly into the car window
11-06-2019T20:46:16,metalman20,that's freaking incredible ord lololol
11-06-2019T20:49:23,AspiringNoodle,I remember the fusion system.  As well as needing to replay against duelists to get a chance at new cards that then make later fights easier.
11-06-2019T20:49:28,AspiringNoodle,Woops
11-06-2019T22:23:55,AspiringNoodle,Did you watch more ScottFalco NOW? :3
