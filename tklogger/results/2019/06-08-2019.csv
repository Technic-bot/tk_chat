06-08-2019T08:44:18,AspiringNoodle,faux hot wings and hard black cherry lemonade
06-08-2019T08:44:21,AspiringNoodle,The breakfast of kings
06-08-2019T09:08:28,AspiringNoodle,Alcohol + hot sauce
06-08-2019T09:08:32,AspiringNoodle,"BAD DECISION, AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH"
06-08-2019T09:08:52,AspiringNoodle,"I kid, these wings aren't very spicy :ptv-hearts:"
06-08-2019T09:32:33,Mikemkke034,Don't overspice
06-08-2019T09:36:37,AspiringNoodle,"When I was younger, I was all about eating the hottest sauces"
06-08-2019T09:36:55,AspiringNoodle,But eventually they all start tasting the same.  Like a bunch of liquified pepper xD
06-08-2019T09:37:13,AspiringNoodle,So now I try to maintain a certain level of tolerance so i can enjoy certain flavors~
06-08-2019T09:41:35,Mikemkke034,I was that way about a year ago. Now my mouth is just too damn sensitive
06-08-2019T09:42:00,Mikemkke034,Sometimes sour things cause my mouth to react too
06-08-2019T10:12:32,CrimsonQuill,Hullo there

06-08-2019T10:23:37,Mikemkke034,Nevermind....it's server side
06-08-2019T10:23:46,CrimsonQuill,360 or 1?
06-08-2019T10:24:05,Mikemkke034,One
06-08-2019T10:24:13,Mikemkke034,One S if needed
06-08-2019T10:24:25,CrimsonQuill,Ok
06-08-2019T10:24:40,CrimsonQuill,I have my dad's 360
06-08-2019T10:24:42,Mikemkke034,It's on Microsoft's side
06-08-2019T10:24:49,CrimsonQuill,"Well, technically it's the family 360."
06-08-2019T10:24:52,Mikemkke034,Core Services are down (Sign in)
06-08-2019T10:24:59,Mikemkke034,And true
06-08-2019T10:25:12,CrimsonQuill,Doesn't really affect me...I ran out of Live.
06-08-2019T10:25:29,Mikemkke034,I have yearly
06-08-2019T10:25:33,CrimsonQuill,Plus...hardly anyone is on the Halo Reach Servers anyhow....*Siiiigh*
06-08-2019T10:25:47,Mikemkke034,Halo for 360 or One?
06-08-2019T10:25:56,CrimsonQuill,Halo for 3560.
06-08-2019T10:25:58,CrimsonQuill,360
06-08-2019T10:26:01,Mikemkke034,I know that Reach is orginally 360
06-08-2019T10:26:05,CrimsonQuill,"Reach hasn't come to MCC yet anyhow,..."
06-08-2019T10:26:15,Mikemkke034,Ah
06-08-2019T10:26:23,CrimsonQuill,I'm on 360.
06-08-2019T10:26:24,Mikemkke034,Though you CAN play it on ONe
06-08-2019T10:26:35,CrimsonQuill,I don't have a one.
06-08-2019T10:27:02,Mikemkke034,Ah
06-08-2019T10:27:04,CrimsonQuill,And my friend is helping me make a PC that will hopefully run it when it comes out on Steam...
06-08-2019T10:27:31,Mikemkke034,I'm needing to look at building a PC again...mine is trash
06-08-2019T10:27:37,CrimsonQuill,"I want to have silly, stupid fun playing crazy games like smashing warthogs with gravity hammers, or mongoose racing."
06-08-2019T10:27:40,Mikemkke034,(Pre-built)
06-08-2019T10:27:52,Mikemkke034,That would be fun
06-08-2019T10:27:53,CrimsonQuill,Like the videos I saw on yutube.
06-08-2019T10:28:15,CrimsonQuill,Been re-arranging my room as is.
06-08-2019T10:28:26,CrimsonQuill,Raine has moved off the bedside table and onto the bookshelf.
06-08-2019T10:28:34,Mikemkke034,Raine?
06-08-2019T10:28:49,CrimsonQuill,My signed Raine Print. I keep it by my bed.
06-08-2019T10:29:01,Mikemkke034,Oh. Nice!
06-08-2019T10:29:03,CrimsonQuill,I got it when I ordered Volume 4 last year.
06-08-2019T10:29:24,CrimsonQuill,"I was almost broke but I thought, I'll never be able to get it again, and said screw it."
06-08-2019T10:29:34,Mikemkke034,Lol
06-08-2019T10:29:54,Mikemkke034,I'm probably gonna get the books with my next paycheck (If I can)
06-08-2019T10:30:11,CrimsonQuill,I can't wait for Volume 5.
06-08-2019T10:30:19,Mikemkke034,Same!
06-08-2019T10:31:40,Mikemkke034,I love playing Black Ops with rock blasting through my headphones :joy:
06-08-2019T10:31:54,CrimsonQuill,I don't really play COD that much now.
06-08-2019T10:32:23,Mikemkke034,I've been playing it with a friend of mine recently. But I'm playing BO3 campaign again
06-08-2019T10:32:51,CrimsonQuill,"I've played MW1 and 3, and Advanced Warfare."
06-08-2019T10:33:01,AspiringNoodle,Son of a xD
06-08-2019T10:33:05,Mikemkke034,What
06-08-2019T10:33:13,AspiringNoodle,I'm buying computer parts now
06-08-2019T10:33:20,Mikemkke034,Oh boy
06-08-2019T10:33:22,AspiringNoodle,And ofc now is when the processor sells out
06-08-2019T10:33:28,Mikemkke034,Lmao
06-08-2019T10:33:37,Mikemkke034,Should've bought them yesterday man
06-08-2019T10:33:37,AspiringNoodle,"""I don't know who you are. But I will find you. And I will kill you."""
06-08-2019T10:33:44,CrimsonQuill,I cannot look at anyone saying 'Son of a x' Without thinking about Red vs Blue.
06-08-2019T10:33:49,CrimsonQuill,Ooh Taken Reference
06-08-2019T10:33:57,AspiringNoodle,:3
06-08-2019T10:34:00,CrimsonQuill,Never watched it but my aunt loves that film.
06-08-2019T10:34:06,Mikemkke034,Lol
06-08-2019T10:34:15,CrimsonQuill,She really likes Liam Neesons's films.
06-08-2019T10:34:17,AspiringNoodle,"Meh, it's probably available elsewhere"
06-08-2019T10:34:31,Mikemkke034,Still should've gotten it yesterday
06-08-2019T10:35:32,AspiringNoodle,Or this morning when I woke up :P
06-08-2019T10:35:37,Mikemkke034,That too

06-08-2019T10:37:34,AspiringNoodle,There's a good chance it might come back in stock later today or tomorrow
06-08-2019T10:37:53,AspiringNoodle,It's in stock way longer than it is out of stock these days
06-08-2019T10:38:05,Mikemkke034,That's good
06-08-2019T10:39:25,AspiringNoodle,"Yeah, this latest batch of processors was in stock for ~5 days"

06-08-2019T11:16:37,Mikemkke034,I suggested something about hangliders
06-08-2019T11:16:45,Mikemkke034,Not sure how well it'll do
06-08-2019T11:17:03,Mikemkke034,But I'm in on the Baby Squirrel

06-08-2019T13:41:15,Yevni,decides 1050Ti is good enough for VR
06-08-2019T14:55:33,SpazztasticKiwi,I have 4 hours at work but I have a feeling it’ll be packaging today’s bread and layout plus the regular closing
06-08-2019T14:55:57,SpazztasticKiwi,the usual
06-08-2019T14:56:27,SpazztasticKiwi,which means maybe staying over and doing a bunch in a small time
06-08-2019T15:06:40,Mikemkke034,I have from now until after 22:00
06-08-2019T15:19:46,CrimsonQuill,Two chapters tonight to read
06-08-2019T15:19:54,CrimsonQuill,Some of my favourites
06-08-2019T15:20:18,Mikemkke034,On what?
06-08-2019T15:20:31,CrimsonQuill,Twokinds of course!
06-08-2019T15:20:40,Mikemkke034,Lol
06-08-2019T15:20:43,CrimsonQuill,I...re-read it very often.
06-08-2019T15:20:47,Mikemkke034,I should've figured
06-08-2019T15:20:52,CrimsonQuill,This is probably the fourth time this year.
06-08-2019T15:21:03,CrimsonQuill,And I'll read it again when Volume 5 comes out!
06-08-2019T15:21:03,Mikemkke034,Wow
06-08-2019T15:23:48,AspiringNoodle,Called it
06-08-2019T15:23:53,AspiringNoodle,3700x back in stock 4 hours later
06-08-2019T15:23:57,CrimsonQuill,Nice
06-08-2019T15:24:18,AspiringNoodle,The 3900 also came back in stock 4 times today
06-08-2019T15:24:23,AspiringNoodle,"For about 8 minutes a piece, lmao"
06-08-2019T15:25:16,AspiringNoodle,"2:16 - 2:23, 2:55 - 3:03, 3:27 - 3:35, and 3:43 - 3:50"
06-08-2019T15:25:57,Mikemkke034,Wow...
06-08-2019T15:26:25,AspiringNoodle,And the new 3600 CL16 memory came in stuck
06-08-2019T15:26:28,AspiringNoodle,"Huh, neat"
06-08-2019T15:26:52,AspiringNoodle,Gonna do a quick double check than choose between that or an older kit of 3200 CL14 (old look)
06-08-2019T15:27:17,Bgrmystr2,did you even get one of em? You should have.
06-08-2019T15:27:19,Bgrmystr2,also hello\
06-08-2019T15:27:20,AspiringNoodle,"LTT's tests had situations where the 3600 kit had higher averages, but worse 5% and 1% lows"
06-08-2019T15:27:29,Mikemkke034,Hey
06-08-2019T15:30:01,CrimsonQuill,Hello Bgr
06-08-2019T15:30:03,CrimsonQuill,You ok?
06-08-2019T15:30:10,Bgrmystr2,No I'm ded
06-08-2019T15:30:19,AspiringNoodle,And I'm about to be fed <3
06-08-2019T15:30:22,CrimsonQuill,Tired
06-08-2019T15:30:22,Bgrmystr2,"but it's okay, I wouldn't die even if you killed me"
06-08-2019T15:30:30,CrimsonQuill,You are unkillable
06-08-2019T15:30:38,CrimsonQuill,And thank goodness for that
06-08-2019T15:30:43,Bgrmystr2,I found anti-kill
06-08-2019T15:30:46,CrimsonQuill,:D
06-08-2019T15:31:17,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock: I just often wonder.. what if anti-kill was kill?
06-08-2019T15:31:44,Bgrmystr2,I probably then would finding super dead.
06-08-2019T15:32:05,CrimsonQuill,It's like having an Antichrist for the Antichrist.
06-08-2019T15:32:10,CrimsonQuill,The Antichrist's Antichrist.
06-08-2019T15:32:18,Bgrmystr2,Antiantichrist
06-08-2019T15:32:18,CrimsonQuill,The two would cancel off.
06-08-2019T15:32:20,CrimsonQuill,out
06-08-2019T15:32:23,CrimsonQuill,LOL
06-08-2019T15:32:34,Bgrmystr2,that's what you'd call it
06-08-2019T15:32:51,CrimsonQuill,The irony is
06-08-2019T15:33:01,CrimsonQuill,Literally just as the chat is warming up....
06-08-2019T15:33:07,CrimsonQuill,I'm getting ready for bed
06-08-2019T15:33:16,CrimsonQuill,XD
06-08-2019T15:33:22,Bgrmystr2,at 3:33pm

06-08-2019T15:33:41,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, I am too, but at least I'm close."
06-08-2019T15:33:41,CrimsonQuill,"Well, it's 9:33 pm here,"
06-08-2019T15:33:47,Bgrmystr2,"what, you quitter"

06-08-2019T15:34:05,CrimsonQuill,Nah
06-08-2019T15:34:16,CrimsonQuill,I have two chapters of Twokinds to read
06-08-2019T15:34:22,CrimsonQuill,And study starts at 9am
06-08-2019T15:34:31,CrimsonQuill,Animals let out before that at 6:30am
06-08-2019T15:34:43,Bgrmystr2,"man, need to set your priorities straight"
06-08-2019T15:34:45,Bgrmystr2,:P
06-08-2019T15:35:06,CrimsonQuill,Maybe I should become an artist for a living.
06-08-2019T15:35:18,CrimsonQuill,Or a professional procrastinator.
06-08-2019T15:35:46,Bgrmystr2,"we call the latter game youtubers, or game streamers :v"
06-08-2019T15:36:24,CrimsonQuill,"Dammit, I knew the job was taken!"
06-08-2019T15:36:32,CrimsonQuill,Anyway...

06-08-2019T15:55:03,SpazztasticKiwi,patreon afraid of the booty

06-08-2019T15:56:14,SpazztasticKiwi,and from the looks of Keith he is too

06-08-2019T16:04:59,Sclimshady,"Tom: butts, LOL"

06-08-2019T16:20:58,Bgrmystr2,growing up means butts :v
06-08-2019T16:24:50,SpazztasticKiwi,butts are like boobs but everyone got a butt

06-08-2019T18:49:51,IronHorseComics,I ride in to find someone $2000 in debt
06-08-2019T19:09:14,SomeNiceUser,"I seem very interested in the Acer nitro 5, but should I go for the Acer nitro 7?"
06-08-2019T19:10:24,SomeNiceUser,"I have given up on Ryzen powered laptops, they don’t sell those anymore..."
06-08-2019T19:15:28,SomeNiceUser,"And the ones that do, are expensive."
06-08-2019T19:17:41,Bgrmystr2,I don't think I'd trust Acer with much anything honestly
06-08-2019T19:17:59,Bgrmystr2,Everything I've gotten from them has failed spectacularly out of the box
06-08-2019T19:18:40,SomeNiceUser,What about MSI?
06-08-2019T19:19:51,SomeNiceUser,I heard from a friend it is pretty good.
06-08-2019T19:20:20,Bgrmystr2,"Yeah I've gotten several GPUs from MSI for myself and others, and bar my 760, they're all quality hardware manufactured"
06-08-2019T19:21:00,Bgrmystr2,"If I had to buy a laptop, I'd probably go with ASUS, MSI, Lenovo if I recall correctly..?"
06-08-2019T19:21:16,Bgrmystr2,I honestly wouldn't touch Acer or Dell/Alienware
06-08-2019T19:21:35,Bgrmystr2,"Alienware has never been good since Dell bought it out, and they cut corners hard"
06-08-2019T19:21:58,SomeNiceUser,"Alienware is certainly off the list, Acer is just cheep."
06-08-2019T19:22:57,Bgrmystr2,"you can probably trust gigabyte, they've got some solid tech and have apparently improved over the years since I last knew."
06-08-2019T19:23:12,SomeNiceUser,What MSi series do you prefer?
06-08-2019T19:23:15,Bgrmystr2,I'd always say check a site like newegg for the model you're buying and look at the review split
06-08-2019T19:23:52,Bgrmystr2,"well I don't use a laptop cuz they're overpriced for what little you get compared to a standard desktop, and the mobility means nothing to me, honestly"
06-08-2019T19:24:07,Bgrmystr2,so atm I don't really have an answer
06-08-2019T19:24:49,SomeNiceUser,"For me, the portability is what I need."
06-08-2019T19:25:10,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, I do have a laptop, but it's only if I need to transfer files or scan external hardware, test something on the network, or whatever. It's not something I'd rely on"
06-08-2019T19:25:28,Bgrmystr2,and it was some old hand-me-down laptop that a school was going to throw away anyway
06-08-2019T19:26:36,Bgrmystr2,"I figure just look into the range you would expect to purchase on a desktop, then tack on probably about 20 to 30%"
06-08-2019T19:26:43,Bgrmystr2,for the cost of mobility
06-08-2019T19:28:14,Bgrmystr2,there's some ASUS laptops that have ryzen 7s for around $900
06-08-2019T19:29:32,SomeNiceUser,"I’m in Canada, so it kinda limits my selections."
06-08-2019T19:31:21,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno if this is anything like what you'd want, but it's not bad"
06-08-2019T19:31:22,Bgrmystr2,https://www.newegg.com/icicle-gold-asus-vivobook-f505za-dh51-mainstream/p/N82E16834235097
06-08-2019T19:32:31,Bgrmystr2,its' upgradable to 16gb of ram and you can throw in an SSD
06-08-2019T19:32:59,Bgrmystr2,"for me, the price is $480 but I dunno what you'd pay for it up there"
06-08-2019T19:33:49,Bgrmystr2,it's on sale too with the original price at $650
06-08-2019T19:34:05,Bgrmystr2,that's probably the kind of thing you should be looking at
06-08-2019T19:34:13,AspiringNoodle,I'm late to the party
06-08-2019T19:34:21,AspiringNoodle,ASUS / ACER are legendary for their horrible customer service
06-08-2019T19:34:36,Bgrmystr2,I've never had any issues with ASUS
06-08-2019T19:34:39,AspiringNoodle,I would not recommend buying their products unless you do it through a retailer / website that will fight them over anything
06-08-2019T19:34:43,Bgrmystr2,Acer sure though
06-08-2019T19:35:02,AspiringNoodle,"ASUS is high quality, sure enough, but recently their QC has been slipping up"
06-08-2019T19:35:05,Bgrmystr2,"Thankfully, when you buy from newegg, they have their own customer service"
06-08-2019T19:35:09,AspiringNoodle,And god help you if youneed to get anything done
06-08-2019T19:35:33,AspiringNoodle,"I can make good GPU recommendations, though :D"
06-08-2019T19:36:18,AspiringNoodle,"Barring ASUS, EVGA/MSI/Gigabyte are good brands for Nvidia"
06-08-2019T19:36:26,Bgrmystr2,not that it matters cuz you can't change a GPU in a laptop
06-08-2019T19:36:33,AspiringNoodle,Sapphire/PowerColor/MSI/Gigabyte for amd
06-08-2019T19:37:01,AspiringNoodle,"As long as it's not ASUS, ACER, or Apple, you good :3"
06-08-2019T19:37:39,Bgrmystr2,I would discount ASUS cuz I don't really know of any problems with them personally
06-08-2019T19:38:02,AspiringNoodle,I'm glad for you <3
06-08-2019T19:38:21,AspiringNoodle,"But seriously, they have their own subreddit, lol"
06-08-2019T19:38:23,Bgrmystr2,Should be as such for everyone. Unfortunately.. were it so easy :thinking:
06-08-2019T19:38:28,AspiringNoodle,r/Asused
06-08-2019T19:38:34,SomeNiceUser,"Got 2000$ on my budget. For you guys, it’s about 1500$."
06-08-2019T19:38:45,Bgrmystr2,oh that's not bad then
06-08-2019T19:38:51,AspiringNoodle,My budget was soooooo much higher because of gift cards xD
06-08-2019T19:39:02,SomeNiceUser,Lucky lol
06-08-2019T19:39:03,AspiringNoodle,"But I still personally contributed $2000, so it stings"
06-08-2019T19:39:20,AspiringNoodle,I have a savings account I made exclusively for pc parts
06-08-2019T19:39:51,AspiringNoodle,It is now sitting at ~$300.  I'm contemplating moving some money from my checking account to savings because I wasn't able to use my visa giftcard on the purchase
06-08-2019T19:40:53,AspiringNoodle,"...But let's be honest, I'm gonna wait for a steam sale, lol"
06-08-2019T19:41:06,Bgrmystr2,"Well for laptops if you want Ryzen, you get a choice between ASUS, Acer, and HP. ASUS is the least of the 3 evils."
06-08-2019T19:41:23,AspiringNoodle,I would have to agree
06-08-2019T19:41:41,AspiringNoodle,"Also, performance.  ASUS loves their performance"
06-08-2019T19:41:52,Bgrmystr2,yes for sure
06-08-2019T19:42:38,AspiringNoodle,"That's what kills me, tbh"
06-08-2019T19:42:49,AspiringNoodle,ASUS is legendary for both being good and bad at the same time
06-08-2019T19:43:00,Bgrmystr2,"ASUS apparently has a TUF series of laptops, they look solid, hardware wise"
06-08-2019T19:43:03,AspiringNoodle,"Best performance possible products, but horrible CS"
06-08-2019T19:43:19,AspiringNoodle,Although it seems to vary from country to country
06-08-2019T19:43:36,AspiringNoodle,"And for the countries with aggressive consumer protection laws, ASUS can't weasle out of repairs / replacements"
06-08-2019T19:43:50,Bgrmystr2,https://www.newegg.com/black-asus-tuf-gaming-fx505dv-pb74-gaming-entertainment/p/N82E16834235202 Like this one looks good
06-08-2019T19:44:49,Bgrmystr2,"and it's $1400, just under the price point"
06-08-2019T19:45:13,AspiringNoodle,Me gusta
06-08-2019T19:45:15,Bgrmystr2,"unfortunately, it doesn't have any reviews"
06-08-2019T19:45:24,AspiringNoodle,That looks like a solid gaming laptop for on-the-go
06-08-2019T19:46:00,Bgrmystr2,yeah @SomeNiceUser that one I just linked could be worth your monies.
06-08-2019T19:46:05,Bgrmystr2,or he could be gone.
06-08-2019T19:47:11,SomeNiceUser,"Nah, I’m still here."
06-08-2019T19:47:22,Bgrmystr2,"Wb, you had left the chat actually."
06-08-2019T19:47:26,Bgrmystr2,Were not in the user list.
06-08-2019T19:47:32,Bgrmystr2,tis why the @ failed
06-08-2019T19:47:51,SomeNiceUser,You are also right about that.
06-08-2019T19:48:00,AspiringNoodle,Anyone curious as to my final build?
06-08-2019T19:48:22,SomeNiceUser,I left since I have no actual working pc
06-08-2019T19:48:39,SomeNiceUser,So I had to improvise.
06-08-2019T19:49:04,SomeNiceUser,Sucks having this sorry
06-08-2019T19:49:21,SomeNiceUser,little thing know as a ipad
06-08-2019T19:49:48,SomeNiceUser,iPad mini 2 if you’re wondering.
06-08-2019T19:50:04,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-shock:*[APPLE!]
06-08-2019T19:50:26,Sclimshady,:apple: is gross
06-08-2019T19:51:11,SomeNiceUser,"It’s also a gift from one of the towns club, so I’m grateful for this."
06-08-2019T19:51:17,AspiringNoodle,Not gross piece of electronics: https://pcpartpicker.com/list/xGtDpG
06-08-2019T19:51:24,AspiringNoodle,"Quick, avert your eyes"
06-08-2019T19:51:29,AspiringNoodle,Apple will steal your soul
06-08-2019T19:51:32,AspiringNoodle,And your wallet
06-08-2019T19:51:36,AspiringNoodle,Not necessarily in that order!
06-08-2019T19:52:31,Bgrmystr2,lol includes windows 10 in the price
06-08-2019T19:52:44,SomeNiceUser,lol
06-08-2019T19:53:04,Bgrmystr2,so effectively $2500
06-08-2019T19:53:28,Bgrmystr2,not bad I think
06-08-2019T19:53:50,Bgrmystr2,"a bit expensive to me, but I think that's more the hardware pricing problem"
06-08-2019T19:54:21,AspiringNoodle,The motherboard and GPU are likely $100 too high each
06-08-2019T19:56:47,Bgrmystr2,"If the motherboard was $200, and GPU was $500, you could probably get a $100 case and cut 300 bucks off the price. $2200 seems reasonable for that level of performance, but I think several things are a bit too pricey"
06-08-2019T19:57:26,Bgrmystr2,I'll leave the NVMe alone since it's 2tb
06-08-2019T19:57:33,SomeNiceUser,Budget time.
06-08-2019T19:57:47,Bgrmystr2,a budget computer would be different parts and cost less
06-08-2019T19:57:48,Bgrmystr2,xD
06-08-2019T19:57:54,AspiringNoodle,"Tbf, the case has an insane amount of airflow / building space / storage options"
06-08-2019T19:58:05,Bgrmystr2,yeah but it's way too expensive imo
06-08-2019T19:58:22,AspiringNoodle,It's effectively a full tower :|
06-08-2019T19:59:19,AspiringNoodle,"That aside, I do hope that motherboard prices drop as PCIe gen 4 becomes standard"
06-08-2019T19:59:35,AspiringNoodle,And that Nvidia has their ass handed to them by AMD so they're forced to bring down prices.
06-08-2019T19:59:59,Bgrmystr2,"for all that money, you can just get an open air case, or even just mount it on a testbench. You'd get the same cooling performance plus it'd look badass mounted on your wall."
06-08-2019T20:01:36,AspiringNoodle,There's a reason the case has so much mesh ;)
06-08-2019T20:01:41,AspiringNoodle,I want to keep dust out
06-08-2019T20:02:05,Bgrmystr2,"being open-air entirely allows the whole room to control the temperature rather than the temperature inside the case being the deciding factor. Airflow is fine, but the fact that you have to make a case with so much mesh and huge fans.."
06-08-2019T20:02:14,Bgrmystr2,"it just means the less existance of a case you have, the better your temps are."
06-08-2019T20:02:43,AspiringNoodle,Now you're arguing apples to oranges
06-08-2019T20:02:50,AspiringNoodle,Part of the benefit of a case is protection
06-08-2019T20:03:07,Bgrmystr2,Not really. Temps are temps. They're the same thing
06-08-2019T20:03:13,AspiringNoodle,Temps are temps
06-08-2019T20:03:15,AspiringNoodle,Dust is dust
06-08-2019T20:03:24,AspiringNoodle,Protection is protection
06-08-2019T20:03:33,Bgrmystr2,dust gets everywhere. Even inside cases. Irrelevant airflow.
06-08-2019T20:03:53,SomeNiceUser,Dust is pcs worst enemy.
06-08-2019T20:03:55,AspiringNoodle,"Yes, but at that point you're arguing ""Dust is inevitable, therefore prevention is pointless"""
06-08-2019T20:04:47,Bgrmystr2,"No, I'm saying being open-air is still beneficial, as dust is a factor of life, but you are what creates the dust. Let things you already own do the work."
06-08-2019T20:04:59,AspiringNoodle,Would love to see you argue with sage over the case ;)
06-08-2019T20:05:33,Bgrmystr2,"naw, Sage thinks I'm completely useless in IT despite my being taught this shit since I was 6."
06-08-2019T20:05:47,Bgrmystr2,so that doesn't matter to me.
06-08-2019T20:06:44,Bgrmystr2,"Even legit concerns and statements I'm thrown under the table, so it makes no difference :)"
06-08-2019T20:06:48,AspiringNoodle,I wonder if they'll ever make a 400mm AIO xD
06-08-2019T20:07:52,Bgrmystr2,I'd say just outfit your room and actually clean the damn dust filters for your AC.
06-08-2019T20:08:11,Bgrmystr2,get a decent ceiling fan that works instead of the decrepit thing that came with the house
06-08-2019T20:08:13,SomeNiceUser,"The Asus tuf looks great. Thank you for showing it, took some time to find it again."
06-08-2019T20:08:36,Bgrmystr2,"if that doesn't work for you, I at least hope it helps point you in the right direction :thumbsup:"
06-08-2019T20:10:52,Bgrmystr2,"letting dust sit in the room is the reason the computer sucks the shit up in the first place. If your room ain't dusty to begin with, you really don't need an expensive case."
06-08-2019T20:11:36,Bgrmystr2,"also, with a proper room fan, dust wont settle anywhere anyway, so it already mitigates the need for said case"
06-08-2019T20:11:50,Bgrmystr2,but I'm sure it will vary from room to room.
06-08-2019T20:12:12,AspiringNoodle,You're making a LOT of assumptions
06-08-2019T20:12:17,AspiringNoodle,Like that my room actually has a room fan
06-08-2019T20:13:24,Bgrmystr2,there's not really any assumptions. I'm just giving you general statements which are a given.
06-08-2019T20:13:43,AspiringNoodle,But it is very dismissive
06-08-2019T20:13:49,Bgrmystr2,"If they don't apply to you, they don't apply to you. But that's really the ideal environment"
06-08-2019T20:13:58,AspiringNoodle,"""Ideal"" being the key word"
06-08-2019T20:14:29,AspiringNoodle,"Now you make me want to get that outdoors case out of spite, lmao"
06-08-2019T20:15:07,Bgrmystr2,it doesn't seem too difficult not expensive to take proper care to change an AC air filter or get a decent ceiling fan xD
06-08-2019T20:15:19,AspiringNoodle,1) Can't do a ceiling fan
06-08-2019T20:15:26,AspiringNoodle,2) Our filters are changed regularly
06-08-2019T20:15:36,AspiringNoodle,"3) Real world scenario, bitcheeeeeeeeeeeeees"
06-08-2019T20:15:55,Bgrmystr2,My room is an example of why what I'm saying works.
06-08-2019T20:16:07,Bgrmystr2,and my previous room was a good example as well.
06-08-2019T20:16:37,AspiringNoodle,"However, you're dismissive of my case choice, saying ""You should have / do X/Y/Z and put it in an ideal situation that makes the case pointless"""
06-08-2019T20:16:57,AspiringNoodle,When a large majority of people won't be putting their computers in those situations
06-08-2019T20:17:14,Bgrmystr2,Isn't that the problem of the user though?
06-08-2019T20:17:24,AspiringNoodle,You're missing the point...
06-08-2019T20:17:39,Bgrmystr2,I guess so then :x
06-08-2019T20:17:51,AspiringNoodle,My chat must be fucked up

06-08-2019T20:18:22,Bgrmystr2,but they refused to add the x
06-08-2019T20:18:31,AspiringNoodle,That is super creepy :ptv-shock::ptv-shock::ptv-shock:
06-08-2019T20:18:37,Bgrmystr2,so it's some dumb face and I forgot. Yeah I agree

06-08-2019T20:19:02,Bgrmystr2,"you were going to say a thing. Go, say the thing. :)"
06-08-2019T20:19:26,AspiringNoodle,"My point is, most people are not going to be in your ideal, nearly dust free situation"
06-08-2019T20:20:04,AspiringNoodle,"I do have a ""fan"" but it's for background noise / blowing on my face when I sleep"
06-08-2019T20:20:30,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: I dunno about most. But it's fair to say it won't apply to everyone.
06-08-2019T20:20:30,AspiringNoodle,"We replace the dust filter for the AC regularly, but dust is still noticeably present"
06-08-2019T20:20:51,Bgrmystr2,do you live somewhere in or near the desert like dadro does?
06-08-2019T20:20:59,AspiringNoodle,"Nope, I live in PA :D"
06-08-2019T20:21:10,Bgrmystr2,then wtf xD
06-08-2019T20:21:34,AspiringNoodle,"Odds are, because the house almost looks like an episode of hoarders, there's probably lots of dust settled in areas where it shouldn't be"
06-08-2019T20:21:40,Bgrmystr2,are your doors and/or windows open all the time and letting dust into the house?
06-08-2019T20:21:51,AspiringNoodle,"And until my parents (my father in particular) stop slacking off and clean this shit up, it will always be a problem"
06-08-2019T20:22:15,Bgrmystr2,"Ahh yeah, but that wouldn't be there if it were just you, EVEN if it were the same house."
06-08-2019T20:22:21,Bgrmystr2,and there'd be less dust!
06-08-2019T20:22:48,AspiringNoodle,I cleaned up my room :3
06-08-2019T20:23:00,AspiringNoodle,"And I do dust occassionaly, but there's a film back within a week or two"
06-08-2019T20:23:11,Bgrmystr2,is your room too small to have a fan or something?
06-08-2019T20:23:11,AspiringNoodle,"hold on, I grammar'd"
06-08-2019T20:23:20,AspiringNoodle,occasionally*
06-08-2019T20:23:33,AspiringNoodle,The AC vent is literally in the middle of the ceiling
06-08-2019T20:23:50,AspiringNoodle,And I don't have anywhere but the floor for that tiny little fan
06-08-2019T20:23:55,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
06-08-2019T20:24:54,Bgrmystr2,You can't move the airvent elsewhere in the ceiling eh?
06-08-2019T20:25:16,Bgrmystr2,"seems a little silly for it to be smack dab in the middle, that means it has to come from one of the sides, and can be shortened"
06-08-2019T20:25:46,AspiringNoodle,This is an old house
06-08-2019T20:25:49,AspiringNoodle,30 years old
06-08-2019T20:26:10,CrRAR,You could put a shroud on it to point it elsewhere.
06-08-2019T20:26:12,AspiringNoodle,"Actually, I guess it's closer to 40?"
06-08-2019T20:26:15,Bgrmystr2,"That's somethin being thrown around here where I live too, since the AC doesn't reach my room very well."
06-08-2019T20:26:30,Bgrmystr2,so we need to refangle the AC ducts in the attic
06-08-2019T20:26:50,AspiringNoodle,We did have the AC unit replaced a year or two ago
06-08-2019T20:26:58,AspiringNoodle,And some work was done to improve airflow
06-08-2019T20:27:12,AspiringNoodle,But I'm in the hottest room of the house
06-08-2019T20:27:34,CrRAR,dang
06-08-2019T20:27:36,AspiringNoodle,"And combine that with having to keep the door closed to maintain privacy / noise levels, it all compounds"
06-08-2019T20:28:00,AspiringNoodle,So I am in a far from ideal situation
06-08-2019T20:28:06,AspiringNoodle,And the last thing I want is an open-air case
06-08-2019T20:29:26,Bgrmystr2,"Lol I was gonna link this site that makes mounted wall fans as an alternative to ceiling fans, but god damn the prices"
06-08-2019T20:30:00,Bgrmystr2,"Nvm they don't make em, it's just a seller site"

06-08-2019T20:31:02,AspiringNoodle,"On the bright side, I can confirm that the anti-dust coating on GPUs is no joke"
06-08-2019T20:31:16,AspiringNoodle,This 970 man... Everywhere else in the case had a nice coating of dust when I last cleaned it out
06-08-2019T20:31:25,CrRAR,ionically ADVANCED coatingzzz
06-08-2019T20:31:26,AspiringNoodle,But the heatsink?  Not a fucking spec

06-08-2019T20:39:04,AspiringNoodle,I'd end up spending more on this fan than I would save if I switched to an open-air case with the fan ;D
06-08-2019T20:39:19,AspiringNoodle,Savings? $100.  Fan? $400
06-08-2019T20:39:21,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s a store sign
06-08-2019T20:39:35,AspiringNoodle,"So the $200 case looks better by comparison, lmao"
06-08-2019T20:39:45,CrRAR,I see
06-08-2019T20:40:07,Bgrmystr2,"yeah for a room without a fan for sure it's not a great tradeoff, and the case would be a superior choice"
06-08-2019T20:40:07,SpazztasticKiwi,they get put right inside the doors sure but somebody put one right outside the awning
06-08-2019T20:40:25,Bgrmystr2,"for a room that already has a fan, it's not as much of a problem"

06-08-2019T21:26:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I considered pizza but there was only frozen unless I wanted to go all the way to lil caesars
06-08-2019T21:26:52,Mikemkke034,Now's there's just us
06-08-2019T21:26:57,CrRAR,Sounds like you chose the righteous path
06-08-2019T21:27:05,Mikemkke034,And LC is not bad. That's where I work :D
06-08-2019T21:27:08,SpazztasticKiwi,I chose laziness
06-08-2019T21:27:12,CrRAR,haha
06-08-2019T21:27:23,CrRAR,I've seen so many commercials for LC lately!

06-08-2019T21:27:45,CrRAR,I've NEVER seen commercials for them before really.
06-08-2019T21:27:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I had work didn’t get a lunch and there’s no one at home to be making anything out of the sweetness of their heart
06-08-2019T21:27:57,CrRAR,We did have one up the street for a LONG time though
06-08-2019T21:28:04,Mikemkke034,It's just all of our new pizzas and such...so tiring to make

06-08-2019T21:28:42,SpazztasticKiwi,I might get pizza tomorrow though
06-08-2019T21:28:42,Mikemkke034,That would be crazy though!
06-08-2019T21:30:36,CrRAR,Was the ravioli multi-cheese?
06-08-2019T21:30:41,SpazztasticKiwi,..alright if anyone needs me I’ll be knee deep in youtube

06-08-2019T21:31:07,Mikemkke034,Okay
06-08-2019T21:31:47,CrRAR,did you sprinkle cheese ON them?
06-08-2019T21:32:44,Mikemkke034,Mmmm
06-08-2019T21:32:46,Mikemkke034,Chz
06-08-2019T21:33:03,CrRAR,damn youtube stealing away people's attention.

06-08-2019T21:34:58,CrRAR,x'D
06-08-2019T21:35:48,Mikemkke034,I'll let you know
06-08-2019T21:35:59,SpazztasticKiwi,no there wasn’t chez
06-08-2019T21:36:31,SpazztasticKiwi,beef ravioli with chez isn’t right unless you prepare it with the cheese
06-08-2019T21:37:07,CrRAR,yes lack of cheese is disturbing
06-08-2019T21:37:16,Mikemkke034,Very much so
06-08-2019T21:37:17,SpazztasticKiwi,you can’t just throw chez in - it must merge with the beef sauce so harmony is reached
06-08-2019T21:38:00,SpazztasticKiwi,would you stuff your hamburger meant with cheese only after taking it off the grill?
06-08-2019T21:38:23,Mikemkke034,Yes
06-08-2019T21:38:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"no, you stuff the meat with the chez before you grill"
06-08-2019T21:38:36,CrRAR,tru
06-08-2019T21:38:57,SpazztasticKiwi,that’s how you get it melted all through the meat
06-08-2019T21:38:58,Mikemkke034,Yeah. Didn't quite decipher what you meant
06-08-2019T21:39:04,CrRAR,you could melt it all on afterward using a toaster over
06-08-2019T21:39:09,Mikemkke034,That too!
06-08-2019T21:39:13,SpazztasticKiwi,that’s cheap
06-08-2019T21:39:18,SpazztasticKiwi,and cheating
06-08-2019T21:39:22,Mikemkke034,But effective
06-08-2019T21:39:22,CrRAR,Through on some provolone or mozzarella
06-08-2019T21:39:31,Mikemkke034,Yum
06-08-2019T21:39:32,CrRAR,*Throw
06-08-2019T21:39:38,Mikemkke034,Burgers with Mozz
06-08-2019T21:40:00,SpazztasticKiwi,I wonder how mad someone would be if there was a celebratory cheese bucket thrown on then
06-08-2019T21:40:08,CrRAR,But I agree with rolling cheese into a hamburger
06-08-2019T21:40:15,Mikemkke034,I would be happy
06-08-2019T21:40:15,CrRAR,or meatball
06-08-2019T21:40:19,CrRAR,or meatloaf
06-08-2019T21:40:22,SpazztasticKiwi,why not put all the cheeses on the burger
06-08-2019T21:40:36,CrRAR,on and IN the burger.
06-08-2019T21:40:39,SpazztasticKiwi,5 chez bgrs with bacon bits
06-08-2019T21:40:54,CrRAR,yis bacon
06-08-2019T21:40:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d eat that
06-08-2019T21:41:19,Mikemkke034,That's delicious sounding. Though it needs to be real bacon. Not bacon bits
06-08-2019T21:41:29,SpazztasticKiwi,you know there’s a restaurant that sells a bgr legitimately covered in melted cheese
06-08-2019T21:41:36,Mikemkke034,Name?

06-08-2019T22:00:22,AspiringNoodle,"""It's over 9000."""
06-08-2019T22:00:36,Mikemkke034,You mean 9000.1
06-08-2019T22:00:48,SpazztasticKiwi,though I do wonder why exactly he’s red
06-08-2019T22:00:55,CrRAR,haha
06-08-2019T22:01:13,Mikemkke034,Because its a hot chick next to him in a one-piece?
06-08-2019T22:01:16,Mikemkke034,Why else?
06-08-2019T22:01:21,SpazztasticKiwi,"if it’s the hot water, maybe she’s never been in there with him before, if it’s because she’s in a bathing suit"
06-08-2019T22:01:22,CrRAR,It was his private bath time.
06-08-2019T22:01:33,SpazztasticKiwi,tell me something
06-08-2019T22:01:42,CrRAR,yis
06-08-2019T22:01:55,SpazztasticKiwi,if you got a girlfriend and she comes in looking for YOU while you’re in the bath
06-08-2019T22:02:03,SpazztasticKiwi,how fast you getting out?
06-08-2019T22:02:06,Mikemkke034,I like the bathing suit theory
06-08-2019T22:02:15,CrRAR,That is a tiny bath
06-08-2019T22:02:34,Mikemkke034,Depends on if she's join me or not
06-08-2019T22:02:42,CrRAR,"fast enough to safely get out, we don't need no slipping injuries"
06-08-2019T22:03:21,Mikemkke034,But that's too slow
06-08-2019T22:04:17,SpazztasticKiwi,alright how up to sexy times you think you’d be with a broken neck?
06-08-2019T22:04:36,SpazztasticKiwi,"cause you get out too fast, that’s what you get"
06-08-2019T22:04:56,Sclimshady,Necks are for virgins lol

06-08-2019T22:06:02,SpazztasticKiwi,"you saying only virgins have necks, I can understand why yours is so long"
06-08-2019T22:06:09,SpazztasticKiwi,otherwise that makes no sense
06-08-2019T22:06:16,Sclimshady,I was getting to that Kiwi
06-08-2019T22:06:22,Mikemkke034,Not this again

06-08-2019T22:07:40,SpazztasticKiwi,technically so is suicide
06-08-2019T22:08:20,Sclimshady,That's only illegal so law enforcement can force entry to stop ya
06-08-2019T22:08:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"did you know there are places that actually state with signs that if you touch the exposed cables, you will not only be electrocuted to death, but also fined $500"
06-08-2019T22:08:56,Mikemkke034,Hmm

06-08-2019T22:39:05,Mikemkke034,Baby bunny or normal size
06-08-2019T22:39:14,Bgrmystr2,I never cared for the mods. They change too much. I feel like I'm playing some other game at that point
06-08-2019T22:39:19,Bgrmystr2,and that's not why I played it in the first place.
06-08-2019T22:39:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I want to guess baby since it was smol
06-08-2019T22:39:40,SpazztasticKiwi,but maybe it was an adult and they get tinier

06-08-2019T23:56:06,SpazztasticKiwi,it is a good idea to make sure you know what kind she likes or if she’s allergic
06-08-2019T23:56:12,Mikemkke034,True
06-08-2019T23:56:33,Sclimshady,"If she has nut allergies, give her almond buds"
06-08-2019T23:56:37,SpazztasticKiwi,otherwise now she’s mad and sick
06-08-2019T23:57:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"which, spoiler alert, ain’t gonna warm her to you"

06-08-2019T23:58:00,SpazztasticKiwi,there’s plenty of ways to do that don’t involve her wanting to beat you to death
