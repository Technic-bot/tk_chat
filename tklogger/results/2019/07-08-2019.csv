07-08-2019T00:03:24,SpazztasticKiwi,"if you knew that would happen, if you expected it and you still had them - adapt"
07-08-2019T00:03:44,SpazztasticKiwi,I already know I want my husband to myself and no kids
07-08-2019T00:06:36,SpazztasticKiwi,"also I come across a guy who wants to show me his hs pictures and say ‚ÄúI was actually in shape back then, don‚Äôt you think?‚Äù"

07-08-2019T05:38:12,Bgrmystr2,"I saw that, sage"
07-08-2019T05:38:17,SageSaga,you saw nothing
07-08-2019T05:38:28,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, okay I didn't get to see the stream or anything"
07-08-2019T05:38:32,Bgrmystr2,so you're technically correct
07-08-2019T05:38:39,SageSaga,the best kind of correct
07-08-2019T05:38:41,Bgrmystr2,but my notifications yelled at me.
07-08-2019T05:38:48,Bgrmystr2,and they're never wrong
07-08-2019T05:39:07,Bgrmystr2,So I guess.. I know of that.
07-08-2019T05:39:22,SageSaga,my new PC is setup
07-08-2019T05:39:51,Bgrmystr2,"ya just testing it out, I'm guessin"
07-08-2019T05:40:00,SageSaga,and i need to get OBS running right - and OBS Studio has an option that will auto stream some random video to get an idea of what it can do
07-08-2019T05:41:30,Bgrmystr2,"well, at least you know it's set up properly to stream here"
07-08-2019T05:41:46,SageSaga,kinda- i still need to finish setting up the sources
07-08-2019T05:41:52,Bgrmystr2,well yeah all that stuff
07-08-2019T05:41:58,Bgrmystr2,but the going live works for sure
07-08-2019T05:42:47,SageSaga,I will try to get on Early Friday night to test the audio with people here
07-08-2019T05:43:00,SageSaga,i cant find my Gifs though...

07-08-2019T07:03:56,Mikemkke034,Morning
07-08-2019T09:32:43,AspiringNoodle,Morning! :ptv-greetings:
07-08-2019T09:33:03,AspiringNoodle,"I saw a Futurama reference, and I will be joining Sage in the new pc club very soon <3"
07-08-2019T09:59:18,SomeNiceUser,Hello! I haven‚Äôt slept!
07-08-2019T10:16:56,AspiringNoodle,"Voodoo curse and hex, get your ass some rest!"
07-08-2019T10:17:16,AspiringNoodle,"Also yay~ CPU, GPU, and case are already shipped out"
07-08-2019T10:17:39,AspiringNoodle,"Now to wait for mobo, ram, cpu cooler, OS, and ssd~"
07-08-2019T10:19:01,AspiringNoodle,I'm also curious as to what will happen first.  Will all of my parts arrive?  Or will an Aorus 2070 Super become available on Newegg again? :P
07-08-2019T10:48:28,Mikemkke034,Lol
07-08-2019T10:56:54,AspiringNoodle,Just watched a Hardware Unboxed video
07-08-2019T10:57:30,AspiringNoodle,"Looks like ASUS might be pulling a Volkswagen with their ""We have the best VRM cooling solution"" claims :ptv-snicker:"
07-08-2019T10:58:13,AspiringNoodle,HWInfo was reporting VRM temps that were up to 10C lower than temps measured on the backside of the PCB
07-08-2019T10:58:29,AspiringNoodle,"HWInfo: ""Your VRMs are a chill 50C :D"""
07-08-2019T10:58:47,AspiringNoodle,"PCB Backside: ""Pffffft, plz.  It's 60C back here"""
07-08-2019T11:00:00,AspiringNoodle,"And for reference, in his testing, the temps measured via HWInfo, MOSFET, and PCB Backside were all generally within 1 - 5C of each other"
07-08-2019T11:00:05,AspiringNoodle,Except for ASUS
07-08-2019T11:26:57,CrRAR,Oh yeah some of those temp sensors on the motherboard get scary hot near the CPU.
07-08-2019T11:27:50,CrRAR,"HWInfo I've never heard of, HWMonitor is really cool and extensive, including voltages and fan speeds."
07-08-2019T11:28:09,CrRAR,Made by the same folks as CPU-Z.
07-08-2019T11:36:12,AspiringNoodle,"So, apparently the critical temperature for VRMs is 125C"
07-08-2019T11:36:20,AspiringNoodle,"Sooooo, even 70C is chilly xD"
07-08-2019T11:36:53,AspiringNoodle,WOO!
07-08-2019T11:37:00,AspiringNoodle,EVERYTHING IS ON THE WAY!
07-08-2019T11:50:03,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-clovisgirl_shake:
07-08-2019T12:00:58,Mikemkke034,Hey again Terra
07-08-2019T12:01:07,Mikemkke034,And awesome Noodle!
07-08-2019T12:16:04,SomeNiceUser,It‚Äôs fun having a bad migraine.
07-08-2019T12:16:13,SomeNiceUser,:ptv-pouty:
07-08-2019T12:17:06,AspiringNoodle,I've had bad turtle headaches in the past
07-08-2019T12:17:08,AspiringNoodle,So fun~
07-08-2019T12:17:25,AspiringNoodle,And now I'm enjoying freshly trimmed finger nails <3
07-08-2019T12:41:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Sage my notifications saw you
07-08-2019T12:50:11,Mikemkke034,Lol
07-08-2019T13:39:45,SpazztasticKiwi,looking at lipstains like ‚Äúam I ‚Äòhenna to heaven‚Äô or ‚Äòperpetual apricot‚Äô?‚Äù
07-08-2019T13:40:47,Mikemkke034,The first sounds decent
07-08-2019T13:40:56,Mikemkke034,"The latter , meh"
07-08-2019T13:41:18,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs bronze and pink
07-08-2019T13:41:27,SpazztasticKiwi,in a nutshell
07-08-2019T13:41:49,SpazztasticKiwi,thing is I like the first better but it looks like it‚Äôs been messed with
07-08-2019T13:42:43,Mikemkke034,Hmm
07-08-2019T14:15:35,SpazztasticKiwi,the only reason I was just staring at this couple is they look like twins
07-08-2019T14:18:43,Mikemkke034,Oh
07-08-2019T14:24:58,SpazztasticKiwi,and according to tumblr everyone is extremely concerned that Mark bought a tactical shovel with a harpoon inside
07-08-2019T14:30:21,SomeNiceUser,‚ÄúTactical shovel with harpoon inside.‚Äù I wonder what he‚Äôs going to do with it?
07-08-2019T14:32:28,SpazztasticKiwi,nothing good
07-08-2019T14:32:30,SpazztasticKiwi,or safe
07-08-2019T14:34:15,SpazztasticKiwi,he lost in a fight against a pickle
07-08-2019T14:34:30,SomeNiceUser,:ptv-confused:
07-08-2019T14:34:50,SpazztasticKiwi,let‚Äôs just say I‚Äôm grateful Amy‚Äôs there
07-08-2019T14:41:25,Mikemkke034,Same
07-08-2019T14:44:49,SpazztasticKiwi,so cold in this taco bell the drive thu guy has a coat on
07-08-2019T14:45:00,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs 80 degrees
07-08-2019T14:53:59,AspiringNoodle,"Oh boy, things just keep getting better"
07-08-2019T14:54:07,AspiringNoodle,"Ordered my computer, most of my shit will be here tomorrow"
07-08-2019T14:54:22,AspiringNoodle,I do my monthly gig tomorrow and get paid for that
07-08-2019T14:54:50,AspiringNoodle,Then saturday I meet with the manager at the gas station to do paper work and go over company policy~
07-08-2019T15:04:31,SomeNiceUser,Sounds pretty fun.
07-08-2019T15:09:30,Mikemkke034,Pay raise or just extra money for the Company Policy?
07-08-2019T15:46:43,AspiringNoodle,I'm getting a job at a gas station
07-08-2019T15:47:02,AspiringNoodle,"It's not bad, considering I'm using this as a temp job to earn money while I figure out what I'm doing"
07-08-2019T15:47:25,AspiringNoodle,"32 hours a week, and their starting pay is $9.50 an hour.  Plus I might get a pay bump because of past food service experience"
07-08-2019T15:52:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I asked Bagheera if he was cute and he shook his head so I guess he‚Äôs not cute today
07-08-2019T15:52:52,tehbear,my dog sometimes does that when i talk to him when hes begging for foo
07-08-2019T15:52:54,tehbear,food
07-08-2019T15:53:22,SpazztasticKiwi,well I do have pizza but I haven‚Äôt taken it out yet
07-08-2019T15:58:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I love how right after Mark calls himself professional the camera that‚Äôs been auto moving to track hims while filming moves to look at the floor in disappointment
07-08-2019T16:11:38,AspiringNoodle,LMAO
07-08-2019T16:11:58,AspiringNoodle,"""Why do I exist?  Just to suffer?"""
07-08-2019T16:30:15,AspiringNoodle,Anyone here who hates the new twitter desktop ui?
07-08-2019T16:33:49,TerraTheWizard,yes
07-08-2019T16:34:04,TerraTheWizard,i did useragent trickery to force mine back to the old one
07-08-2019T16:35:59,AspiringNoodle,You can download the GoodTwitter addon :P
07-08-2019T16:36:12,AspiringNoodle,Forces the client back to the old layout
07-08-2019T16:36:44,AspiringNoodle,"I honestly hate it when companies completely redesign the layout of their product for no other reason than, ""Because we can"" -_-"
07-08-2019T16:36:54,AspiringNoodle,Especially when the new layout is objectively worse
07-08-2019T16:41:47,Bgrmystr2,people still use twitter? Pff
07-08-2019T16:43:05,SpazztasticKiwi,y‚Äôall this lady on my facebook named her cat Yardstick
07-08-2019T16:43:14,SpazztasticKiwi,he only has 3 feet
07-08-2019T16:43:22,SpazztasticKiwi,I found a new friend
07-08-2019T16:48:21,TeapotOfDoom,You pass butter
07-08-2019T16:48:35,TeapotOfDoom,Also new twitter skin?
07-08-2019T16:49:00,SpazztasticKiwi,didn‚Äôt know twitter had a skin period - now they got a new one?
07-08-2019T16:49:05,SpazztasticKiwi,whose is it
07-08-2019T16:49:36,TeapotOfDoom,Well my wifi speed is so slow it breaks stuff
07-08-2019T16:49:40,SpazztasticKiwi,also mobile twitter ain‚Äôt changed so I don‚Äôt see or have a problem
07-08-2019T16:50:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm not sure I could work desktop twitter or fb at this point
07-08-2019T16:51:06,TeapotOfDoom,Twitter is mostly mobile for me too
07-08-2019T16:51:32,TeapotOfDoom,I kinda left facebook so dunno bout that
07-08-2019T16:51:49,SpazztasticKiwi,twitter twitch youtube facebook tumblr
07-08-2019T16:51:58,TeapotOfDoom,But the new twitter thing is loading in currently and I'm not sure if i like what i see
07-08-2019T16:52:18,SpazztasticKiwi,picarto pinterest instagram
07-08-2019T16:52:22,SpazztasticKiwi,all mobile
07-08-2019T16:52:22,TeapotOfDoom,twitch used to eat my battery for breakfast
07-08-2019T16:52:28,TeapotOfDoom,picarto is even worse
07-08-2019T16:52:41,TeapotOfDoom,also picarto on android is like the absolute worst
07-08-2019T16:52:47,SpazztasticKiwi,my new phones a monster
07-08-2019T16:52:55,SpazztasticKiwi,30 minutes to 50%
07-08-2019T16:52:56,TeapotOfDoom,android or iphone
07-08-2019T16:53:06,SpazztasticKiwi,iphone xr
07-08-2019T16:53:22,SpazztasticKiwi,wireless charging too
07-08-2019T16:53:30,AspiringNoodle,I have very mixed feelings about apple :upside_down:
07-08-2019T16:53:47,AspiringNoodle,Hate the fanboys / marketing / sleezy business practices
07-08-2019T16:54:00,AspiringNoodle,But apparently they are very vehement about protecting their users' data
07-08-2019T16:54:05,TeapotOfDoom,Tried that on my samsung. completely unreliable imo... woke up to my phone being dead
07-08-2019T16:54:11,SpazztasticKiwi,I hate hearing people whine on how ‚Äúbad‚Äù apple is
07-08-2019T16:54:13,TeapotOfDoom,more then once
07-08-2019T16:54:25,TeapotOfDoom,hahaha
07-08-2019T16:54:36,TeapotOfDoom,they just had a scandal concerning a data leak
07-08-2019T16:54:40,TeapotOfDoom,just the other day
07-08-2019T16:54:44,AspiringNoodle,"Kiwi, watch Louis Rossman"
07-08-2019T16:54:59,AspiringNoodle,He has a youtube channel / business dedicated to fixing the products that Apple refuses to
07-08-2019T16:55:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve heard maybe one apple user brag but the amount of android users I‚Äôve heard go on and on makes me happy to stay with apple and never use android
07-08-2019T16:55:23,TeapotOfDoom,Oh no please don't
07-08-2019T16:55:25,SpazztasticKiwi,besides the androids I did have never lasted long
07-08-2019T16:55:40,TeapotOfDoom,Which was the last version you used?
07-08-2019T16:55:43,TeapotOfDoom,It got better
07-08-2019T16:55:51,SpazztasticKiwi,i don‚Äôt remember it‚Äôs been years
07-08-2019T16:56:05,TeapotOfDoom,also imo the engineering is done right for the type of user they aim for
07-08-2019T16:56:30,TeapotOfDoom,they don't produce items for heavy duty use
07-08-2019T16:56:50,SpazztasticKiwi,as far as I‚Äôm concerned it‚Äôs perfectly fine to like and prefer what you like and prefer but putting down others or just so much as raising yourself up based on just your experience or opinion is not attractive
07-08-2019T16:56:53,SpazztasticKiwi,or mature
07-08-2019T16:57:05,AspiringNoodle,"I'd be willing to give MacOS a chance (*MAYBE*), but they only let you use their premades"
07-08-2019T16:57:05,TeapotOfDoom,the do computers used to browse fb in a coffee shop or make some music on but that's about it
07-08-2019T16:57:12,SpazztasticKiwi,let people enjoy things
07-08-2019T16:57:32,SpazztasticKiwi,especially if it‚Äôs their own money and energy and time
07-08-2019T16:57:34,AspiringNoodle,"Kiwi, you are free to use and enjoy Apple products"
07-08-2019T16:57:42,AspiringNoodle,But I highly recommend watching Louis Rossman
07-08-2019T16:57:54,AspiringNoodle,At least be informed about potential ways Apple could try to screw you over
07-08-2019T16:58:01,TeapotOfDoom,but most people are fine with it so don't let me take the fun out
07-08-2019T16:58:26,AspiringNoodle,"In particular, if you ever take a product to Apple and they claim water damage, demand they show you the insides"
07-08-2019T16:58:27,SpazztasticKiwi,that made me think of Louis V of the fashion stuff
07-08-2019T16:58:34,Dadrobit,"""Is trying yo screw you over""* Fixed for ya mate"
07-08-2019T16:58:59,SpazztasticKiwi,"which by the way you know that Louis V company has colored pencils for $1,000"
07-08-2019T16:59:17,TeapotOfDoom,but i agree with noodle on this. apple tends to employ some really shady business tactics which are worth knowing about especially on a brand that locks down repair for their devices like apple does
07-08-2019T16:59:19,AspiringNoodle,"Because odds are, they're claiming water damage due to the detectors in the premade going off, but those can be triggered by humidity"
07-08-2019T16:59:46,AspiringNoodle,"And when they can say ""we won't repair this because water damage"" they better f*cking prove there's actually water damage"
07-08-2019T16:59:56,AspiringNoodle,Hold on...
07-08-2019T17:00:00,Dadrobit,"Or because their techs are completely untrained, they don't actually know what the probem is, and they default to water damage where there is none."
07-08-2019T17:00:01,TeapotOfDoom,also HOLY SHIT THAT'S EVEN WORSE THEN APPLE
07-08-2019T17:00:10,SpazztasticKiwi,yep
07-08-2019T17:00:11,Bgrmystr2,not to mention apple actually breaking hardware inside people's laptops that wasn't broken before.. then charging the user to fix it instead of being honest about breaking it themselves? xD
07-08-2019T17:00:20,SpazztasticKiwi,they‚Äôre really pretty and fancy looking
07-08-2019T17:00:34,TeapotOfDoom,PEOPLE CALM DOWN
07-08-2019T17:00:34,SpazztasticKiwi,all boxed up with a bag and ribbon packing
07-08-2019T17:00:42,SpazztasticKiwi,but they‚Äôre colored pencils
07-08-2019T17:00:45,TeapotOfDoom,WE GOT THE POINT
07-08-2019T17:00:54,Bgrmystr2,"did we though, did we really?"
07-08-2019T17:01:00,AspiringNoodle,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi9en4I-tjA
07-08-2019T17:01:09,AspiringNoodle,Recent video of a dead mobo from a 3 month old laptop from Apple
07-08-2019T17:01:23,AspiringNoodle,"They claim water damage, and it's unfixable because of a chip Apple added"
07-08-2019T17:01:26,Dadrobit,"Yeah, saw that. Absolutely infuriating."
07-08-2019T17:01:31,TeapotOfDoom,i know that this won't stop kiwi from buying more apple stuff. it works for her so why bother
07-08-2019T17:01:49,SpazztasticKiwi,I couldn‚Äôt buy an apple computer
07-08-2019T17:01:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt like how they look
07-08-2019T17:01:58,SpazztasticKiwi,too thin
07-08-2019T17:02:02,TeapotOfDoom,really now?
07-08-2019T17:02:03,Bgrmystr2,Because education is how you solve evil.
07-08-2019T17:02:06,AspiringNoodle,"Tbh, the iPhone is arguably a really good product"
07-08-2019T17:02:09,SpazztasticKiwi,I like me some thicc hardware
07-08-2019T17:02:13,Bgrmystr2,Never stop trying.
07-08-2019T17:02:21,AspiringNoodle,"They've had their flaws, but they're infinitely better than Apple's laptops and AIOs"
07-08-2019T17:02:43,TeapotOfDoom,I think the mb pro design is kinda a benchmark for good laptop design (from the outside please don't get started on this)
07-08-2019T17:03:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I just dunno - apple don‚Äôt seem to know how to make nice looking laptops
07-08-2019T17:03:21,AspiringNoodle,"They don't, lol"
07-08-2019T17:03:27,AspiringNoodle,They also don't know how to cool laptops
07-08-2019T17:03:27,SpazztasticKiwi,"graceful and pretty, elegant, yes"
07-08-2019T17:03:33,SpazztasticKiwi,but eh
07-08-2019T17:03:36,TeapotOfDoom,beauty is in the eye of the beholder
07-08-2019T17:03:51,TeapotOfDoom,that's what i was mostly focusing on
07-08-2019T17:03:58,SpazztasticKiwi,sleek and fancy but I want some meat on those wires
07-08-2019T17:04:03,AspiringNoodle,"I'm not joking.  The cooler design on their laptops is so awful, they have to use software tomfoolery to keep their processors running at / above rated base clocks"
07-08-2019T17:04:21,TeapotOfDoom,cooling and engineering is garbage in some cases but the design on it's own i quite like
07-08-2019T17:04:27,AspiringNoodle,"You'll likely never see *sustained* boost clocks, and your processor will be sitting in the mid 90's under load"
07-08-2019T17:04:48,TeapotOfDoom,i know noodle don't get me started
07-08-2019T17:04:54,AspiringNoodle,Keep in mind that processors generally have a Tj Max of 100 - 105C
07-08-2019T17:05:10,AspiringNoodle,So I strongly advise against EVER getting an Apple laptop
07-08-2019T17:05:18,TeapotOfDoom,I ranted for about 15 minutes a few weeks ago about their bad engineering
07-08-2019T17:05:29,TeapotOfDoom,doesn't help tho
07-08-2019T17:05:36,TeapotOfDoom,they know how to sell a product
07-08-2019T17:05:41,SpazztasticKiwi,the design does offer a lighter package which is nice but you could bend it just too far and something will snap
07-08-2019T17:05:53,TeapotOfDoom,you mean the screen?
07-08-2019T17:06:04,SpazztasticKiwi,or even the keyboard half
07-08-2019T17:06:18,AspiringNoodle,Good news on the keyboard front
07-08-2019T17:06:23,SpazztasticKiwi,the whole things like two knife blades
07-08-2019T17:06:27,AspiringNoodle,They're FINALLY ditching the god awful butterfly design :D
07-08-2019T17:06:34,TeapotOfDoom,which model do you mean?
07-08-2019T17:06:40,TeapotOfDoom,the mb or mb pro
07-08-2019T17:06:47,SpazztasticKiwi,there was literally someone who got a mac and tried slicing bread with it
07-08-2019T17:06:53,TeapotOfDoom,lol
07-08-2019T17:06:58,TeapotOfDoom,i think i even saw that
07-08-2019T17:07:10,SpazztasticKiwi,"as cumbersome as it is, it technically works"
07-08-2019T17:07:11,TeapotOfDoom,someone tried to grate cheese with the new cheese grater
07-08-2019T17:07:32,TeapotOfDoom,we're currently trying to recreate the pattern with our cnc
07-08-2019T17:07:39,AspiringNoodle,Here's where I give Apple thumbs up
07-08-2019T17:07:47,AspiringNoodle,"Data privacy, software"
07-08-2019T17:07:57,TeapotOfDoom,they make good kitchen appliances lol
07-08-2019T17:08:10,TeapotOfDoom,"first a bread knife, now a cheese grater"
07-08-2019T17:08:13,SpazztasticKiwi,with my nosey ass mother apple is how I keep my shit mine
07-08-2019T17:08:22,AspiringNoodle,Here's what's really funny
07-08-2019T17:08:49,AspiringNoodle,"I think the reason Apple keeps their OS locked to their proprietary products is because of this old mindset that they don't want to be known as ""gaming computers"""
07-08-2019T17:08:58,Bgrmystr2,"I mean.. all phones nowadays have a lock screen and a bunch have thumbprint identification, or face recognition"
07-08-2019T17:09:17,AspiringNoodle,"Because back in the day, Apple had the most powerful consumer pcs on the market, so they were the best for games"
07-08-2019T17:09:18,TeapotOfDoom,dunno bout that
07-08-2019T17:09:36,TeapotOfDoom,i think it's more of a support scenario
07-08-2019T17:09:53,SpazztasticKiwi,I can‚Äôt even reset my keyboard without my password
07-08-2019T17:10:04,AspiringNoodle,It's sad because Apple is missing out on so much money by locking their OS to their products
07-08-2019T17:10:05,TeapotOfDoom,they don't want to be associated with incompabilites. it would taint their perfeect image
07-08-2019T17:10:24,AspiringNoodle,"Windows is awesome in that way, same with Linux"
07-08-2019T17:10:29,AspiringNoodle,Doesn't really matter what you have :P
07-08-2019T17:10:45,TeapotOfDoom,i love linux but compatibility still is trash
07-08-2019T17:10:47,Bgrmystr2,"ya can't see your imperfections if you don't look at them, is it?"
07-08-2019T17:10:58,Bgrmystr2,they don't exist if you ignore em
07-08-2019T17:11:16,Bgrmystr2,obviously..
07-08-2019T17:11:23,TeapotOfDoom,"no more like as long as i keep the situation in tight controll, there will be less problems"
07-08-2019T17:11:29,TeapotOfDoom,*under
07-08-2019T17:11:39,AspiringNoodle,I'm not a huge fan of that mindset from Apple
07-08-2019T17:11:45,TeapotOfDoom,which could cause bad press
07-08-2019T17:11:47,AspiringNoodle,They really restrict what parts you can get
07-08-2019T17:12:00,SpazztasticKiwi,because yes apple is the only company with skeletons
07-08-2019T17:12:02,TeapotOfDoom,as i said they know how to sell a product
07-08-2019T17:12:12,TeapotOfDoom,skeletons?
07-08-2019T17:12:17,SpazztasticKiwi,flaws
07-08-2019T17:12:18,AspiringNoodle,"It's only a matter of time before the ""sheeple"" wake up ;D"
07-08-2019T17:12:23,TeapotOfDoom,spooky scary skeletons
07-08-2019T17:12:32,TeapotOfDoom,they won't
07-08-2019T17:12:46,AspiringNoodle,"It will, it's only a matter of time"
07-08-2019T17:12:58,AspiringNoodle,Word of mouth is a powerful thing
07-08-2019T17:13:00,Bgrmystr2,"Apple is far from the only company with flaws, but many companies can't just ignore their flaws, they're open and public and people easily speak of it"
07-08-2019T17:13:01,TeapotOfDoom,maybe apple has to change some things but they will continue doing what they're doing
07-08-2019T17:13:01,SpazztasticKiwi,they‚Äôre stupid overboard with privacy and VIPing parts and so but if that‚Äôs what it takes for me to keep my stuff to me so be it
07-08-2019T17:13:15,Bgrmystr2,"apple is not above banning, muting, and silencing critics of them"
07-08-2019T17:13:38,TeapotOfDoom,apple is not magical in that sense kiwi
07-08-2019T17:13:43,Bgrmystr2,which is why they get the brunt of it.
07-08-2019T17:13:49,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve dealt with people thinking it‚Äôs ok to poke in my stuff just because I was under 18 or now just because they‚Äôre related to me and I‚Äôve been over it for years
07-08-2019T17:14:02,TeapotOfDoom,there are simply less users on macos so there is less reason to attack it
07-08-2019T17:14:06,AspiringNoodle,^
07-08-2019T17:14:31,AspiringNoodle,I think every non-apple phone is using some form of Android
07-08-2019T17:14:42,Bgrmystr2,lol no xD
07-08-2019T17:14:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I had some kindles but I don‚Äôt use either now
07-08-2019T17:15:02,Bgrmystr2,"android is an OS, windows phones don't use android"
07-08-2019T17:15:12,SpazztasticKiwi,my phone covers everything I‚Äôve needed so far
07-08-2019T17:15:13,Bgrmystr2,nor do phones that use Linux or whatever as an OS
07-08-2019T17:15:14,TeapotOfDoom,i'm glad my people don't poke
07-08-2019T17:15:28,AspiringNoodle,My phone is fingerprint / password locked
07-08-2019T17:15:31,AspiringNoodle,;)
07-08-2019T17:15:40,AspiringNoodle,"Same with my computer, lol"
07-08-2019T17:15:41,TeapotOfDoom,there is no such thing as windows phone
07-08-2019T17:15:49,SpazztasticKiwi,yeah if I get murdered it‚Äôs gonna be a problem
07-08-2019T17:15:52,Bgrmystr2,don't be silly teapot lol
07-08-2019T17:16:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm the only one that knows any of my passwords
07-08-2019T17:16:22,TeapotOfDoom,could be a problem in my case too lol
07-08-2019T17:16:30,SpazztasticKiwi,"email, social medias, laptop, phone"
07-08-2019T17:16:33,TeapotOfDoom,well my secrets will go down with me
07-08-2019T17:16:36,SpazztasticKiwi,not another soul knows
07-08-2019T17:16:49,SpazztasticKiwi,and I don‚Äôt write that shit down
07-08-2019T17:16:55,TeapotOfDoom,password manager
07-08-2019T17:17:02,SpazztasticKiwi,nope
07-08-2019T17:17:04,TeapotOfDoom,keeps you from a lot of hassle
07-08-2019T17:17:11,SpazztasticKiwi,I never save a password
07-08-2019T17:17:18,Bgrmystr2,I'm not surrounded by untrustable people that are all into my business in aspect of my phone
07-08-2019T17:17:22,SpazztasticKiwi,I am
07-08-2019T17:17:33,Bgrmystr2,"I don't have to worry about it, thankfully."
07-08-2019T17:17:36,TeapotOfDoom,in browser no. i have lastpass
07-08-2019T17:17:38,Bgrmystr2,I still use a lock screen though
07-08-2019T17:17:42,SpazztasticKiwi,and people wonder why I‚Äôm so touchy
07-08-2019T17:18:16,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt I look of you don‚Äôt have nothing to hide‚Äù ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt have anything to hide I can look‚Äù
07-08-2019T17:18:19,SpazztasticKiwi,uh no
07-08-2019T17:18:30,SpazztasticKiwi,how about that‚Äôs my property and back off
07-08-2019T17:18:44,Bgrmystr2,Because privacy is a thing.
07-08-2019T17:18:51,TeapotOfDoom,i dont have a problem with friends looking through my music
07-08-2019T17:19:07,TeapotOfDoom,i have a problem with people randomly using my phone
07-08-2019T17:19:38,SpazztasticKiwi,I had an ADULT who borrowed my laptop once
07-08-2019T17:19:40,SpazztasticKiwi,ONCE
07-08-2019T17:19:43,TeapotOfDoom,"ask first, maybe. don't ask and you will never see that device unlocked again"
07-08-2019T17:19:53,SpazztasticKiwi,to download something for her church kids group thing
07-08-2019T17:20:08,TeapotOfDoom,what happened?
07-08-2019T17:20:09,SpazztasticKiwi,"and after doing so, she decided to look through my videos"
07-08-2019T17:20:12,SpazztasticKiwi,my pictures
07-08-2019T17:20:15,TeapotOfDoom,why
07-08-2019T17:20:17,SpazztasticKiwi,all my media
07-08-2019T17:20:19,TeapotOfDoom,W H Y
07-08-2019T17:20:32,SpazztasticKiwi,because I gave her access to it for 5 minutes
07-08-2019T17:20:33,TeapotOfDoom,that's just stupid
07-08-2019T17:20:52,AspiringNoodle,Lmao
07-08-2019T17:20:54,TeapotOfDoom,that's just simply disrespectfull
07-08-2019T17:21:02,SpazztasticKiwi,and it seems people nowadays thing they can snoop if you open your device to them for something
07-08-2019T17:21:07,AspiringNoodle,Now I want to just have porn folders all over the desktop with various names xD
07-08-2019T17:21:10,SpazztasticKiwi,think
07-08-2019T17:21:17,SpazztasticKiwi,uh no
07-08-2019T17:21:18,AspiringNoodle,"And just put the nastiest, freakiest porn in all of them"
07-08-2019T17:21:31,TeapotOfDoom,a friend of mine did that once. (he still is my best friend) but i told him what i thought about that
07-08-2019T17:21:32,AspiringNoodle,It will serve as punishment for anyone who is too nosy :P
07-08-2019T17:21:32,Bgrmystr2,"lol noodle, I've already beaten you to that and one-upped it."
07-08-2019T17:21:38,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt connect to the internet with my laptop
07-08-2019T17:21:47,SpazztasticKiwi,that place has viruses
07-08-2019T17:21:48,AspiringNoodle,How did it go? TELL ME!
07-08-2019T17:22:14,Bgrmystr2,My friends who saw it are comrades for life :ptv-ohmy::ptv-snicker:
07-08-2019T17:22:20,AspiringNoodle,ha
07-08-2019T17:22:30,AspiringNoodle,But yeah
07-08-2019T17:22:31,TeapotOfDoom,you don't use networking on you laptop
07-08-2019T17:22:34,TeapotOfDoom,what?
07-08-2019T17:22:38,SpazztasticKiwi,I e learned how to lock flash drives and folders and documents and even make documents invisible because people don‚Äôt seem to understand personal property
07-08-2019T17:22:41,SpazztasticKiwi,and space
07-08-2019T17:23:02,TeapotOfDoom,windows key + L
07-08-2019T17:23:06,TeapotOfDoom,solves problems
07-08-2019T17:23:26,Bgrmystr2,"lol kiwi, is there not a guest account on it that doesn't have access to administrator files and folders?"
07-08-2019T17:23:30,Bgrmystr2,they can do stuff on there
07-08-2019T17:23:35,Bgrmystr2,that's the point of guest accounts
07-08-2019T17:23:40,TeapotOfDoom,+1
07-08-2019T17:23:53,SpazztasticKiwi,"Oh I have cut people completely off from my stuff. If you need it, I‚Äôll do it"
07-08-2019T17:23:54,TeapotOfDoom,i never had to use it but good point
07-08-2019T17:24:03,SpazztasticKiwi,certain people that is
07-08-2019T17:24:10,SpazztasticKiwi,it takes one time for me
07-08-2019T17:24:25,SpazztasticKiwi,"after that, you don‚Äôt get another chance to be nosey"
07-08-2019T17:24:35,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
07-08-2019T17:24:49,AspiringNoodle,I guess I'm a rare breed
07-08-2019T17:24:57,AspiringNoodle,I've had to borrow my mother's laptop before to do stuff
07-08-2019T17:25:01,TeapotOfDoom,just send one the love zap
07-08-2019T17:25:02,AspiringNoodle,And I did exactly what I set out to do
07-08-2019T17:25:04,AspiringNoodle,NOTHING ELSE
07-08-2019T17:25:11,TeapotOfDoom,"""consider this a fuckin warning"""
07-08-2019T17:25:32,TeapotOfDoom,me too
07-08-2019T17:25:37,SpazztasticKiwi,oh that‚Äôd be great
07-08-2019T17:25:41,TeapotOfDoom,it was locked down as hell
07-08-2019T17:25:42,SpazztasticKiwi,a shock trigger
07-08-2019T17:25:52,TeapotOfDoom,but i tricked her and got admin rights lol
07-08-2019T17:26:13,SpazztasticKiwi,zap the piss out of thieves and snoopers alike
07-08-2019T17:26:15,TeapotOfDoom,now i admin her machine... so much for that
07-08-2019T17:26:39,TeapotOfDoom,lol
07-08-2019T17:26:42,SpazztasticKiwi,which reminds me of my first job
07-08-2019T17:26:52,TeapotOfDoom,automatic taser integrated into the keyboard
07-08-2019T17:26:53,SpazztasticKiwi,a girl there hated me for no reason
07-08-2019T17:27:14,SpazztasticKiwi,especially since it was immediate that she did and I never talked to her unnecessarily
07-08-2019T17:27:18,TeapotOfDoom,also i did that today
07-08-2019T17:27:26,TeapotOfDoom,lol
07-08-2019T17:27:46,SpazztasticKiwi,I guess she saw the $100 in my wallet that I was spending on a bill later that day at lunch when I paid
07-08-2019T17:27:57,SpazztasticKiwi,cause the next day she was oh so extra sweet
07-08-2019T17:28:04,TeapotOfDoom,don't you love it when people hate you for no reason at all? and they refer from telling you why?
07-08-2019T17:28:16,SpazztasticKiwi,and they caught her on the staff room camera wrists deep in my wallet
07-08-2019T17:28:23,TeapotOfDoom,lol what
07-08-2019T17:28:28,TeapotOfDoom,srsly?
07-08-2019T17:28:41,SpazztasticKiwi,she was fired
07-08-2019T17:28:48,TeapotOfDoom,i hope she was
07-08-2019T17:29:00,TeapotOfDoom,that's just messed up
07-08-2019T17:29:19,SpazztasticKiwi,and I knew she was gonna try something as soon as she was so immediately so suspiciously sweet after clearly not liking me all that time
07-08-2019T17:29:21,TeapotOfDoom,why are people like this
07-08-2019T17:29:42,Bgrmystr2,Because selfish
07-08-2019T17:29:43,SpazztasticKiwi,I wasn‚Äôt the only wallet she raided but I was the only one she didn‚Äôt get anything from
07-08-2019T17:30:07,SpazztasticKiwi,due to others getting in my stuff already I invested in a wallet with a hidden pocket
07-08-2019T17:30:32,TeapotOfDoom,u kiddin me?
07-08-2019T17:30:39,SpazztasticKiwi,"Though the $100 was gone, used on the bill the day before, I still had money, albeit hidden in that pocket"
07-08-2019T17:30:43,TeapotOfDoom,did you just say others
07-08-2019T17:30:46,SpazztasticKiwi,yep
07-08-2019T17:30:57,TeapotOfDoom,...
07-08-2019T17:31:06,SpazztasticKiwi,what part of people like to touch my shit didn‚Äôt you get
07-08-2019T17:31:26,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm not paranoid I‚Äôm just not stupid
07-08-2019T17:31:40,SpazztasticKiwi,mamma didn‚Äôt raise no fool
07-08-2019T17:31:44,TeapotOfDoom,the trust noone motto from gravity falls seems to be more and more appealing
07-08-2019T17:31:52,SpazztasticKiwi,a damn psycho maybe but no fool
07-08-2019T17:31:59,TeapotOfDoom,lol nice one
07-08-2019T17:34:16,TeapotOfDoom,people nosy enough to dig in my wallet would be people i would never deal with again
07-08-2019T17:34:31,TeapotOfDoom,also they'd never even see the damn thing
07-08-2019T17:35:06,SpazztasticKiwi,oh that‚Äôs one of the two things that don‚Äôt leave my side
07-08-2019T17:35:18,TeapotOfDoom,phone and keys
07-08-2019T17:35:20,SpazztasticKiwi,password or not my phone is within sight

07-08-2019T19:12:32,Mikemkke034,Whichever is closet. Mainly because I don't change my Background too often

07-08-2019T19:13:39,Mikemkke034,Only reason why: No other pictures I like. And it's all the same artist
07-08-2019T19:13:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Floras picture is also lined up so my profile picture - which pops up with the password prompt - covers Flora‚Äôs face
07-08-2019T19:13:58,SpazztasticKiwi,my picture is a picture of my cat

07-08-2019T21:09:57,CrRAR,Does it involve hotels and horrors within?
07-08-2019T21:10:04,CrRAR,*clicks*
07-08-2019T21:11:53,CrRAR,Oh yeah I've hard that that the metrics don't reset.
07-08-2019T21:12:36,CrRAR,"Like freaking ink in a printer, make the consumers only go to the source."
07-08-2019T21:13:00,AspiringNoodle,I'll be so happy when legislation is passed against this type of shit
07-08-2019T21:14:35,CrRAR,"See more sophisticated technology is just worse for consumers, they just build in proprietary ways to make things suck. In the old days the hacker community would find a way to reset the metric."
07-08-2019T21:14:52,CrRAR,...or it would just be some secret key routine or something.
07-08-2019T21:15:16,AspiringNoodle,I can't wait for the old farts to get out of office
07-08-2019T21:15:26,CrRAR,haha
07-08-2019T21:15:26,AspiringNoodle,Get some politicians in who actually understand motherfudgin' tech
07-08-2019T21:15:51,CrRAR,Yes bring back common decency to consumer goods.
07-08-2019T21:16:00,CrRAR,Shareholders be damned.
07-08-2019T21:16:02,AspiringNoodle,Here's something funny
07-08-2019T21:16:17,AspiringNoodle,Apparently somewhere in the world legislation was passed requiring lootbox odds to be disclosed
07-08-2019T21:16:28,AspiringNoodle,"And I'm just, like, ""Omegalul, Overwatch has had the odds disclosed for years"""
07-08-2019T21:16:34,CrRAR,Oh yeah I heard that
07-08-2019T21:16:53,AspiringNoodle,I've gotten heat for defending Overwatch's loot boxes
07-08-2019T21:17:05,AspiringNoodle,"While I hate them in general, Overwatch has the best implementation to date"
07-08-2019T21:17:10,Bgrmystr2,Not surprising. it's still gambling.
07-08-2019T21:17:12,CrRAR,It's mostly because it's viewed as a form of gambling.
07-08-2019T21:17:17,CrRAR,yeah bgr
07-08-2019T21:17:37,AspiringNoodle,"We actually got a pretty decent changed made to the loot boxes, too"
07-08-2019T21:17:42,Bgrmystr2,it's paying for a random thing you're not guaranteed. That's gambling by definition.
07-08-2019T21:18:13,AspiringNoodle,"After listening to community feedback, they were changed so they no longer drop duplicates until you've exhausted the entire pool of a given rarity"
07-08-2019T21:18:40,CrRAR,That sweet sweet dose of loot box dopamine
07-08-2019T21:18:44,AspiringNoodle,"While I still think it's bs that duplicates only drop 20% of the cost of the item, and chests only give you 50%, it's still pretty good"
07-08-2019T21:19:12,AspiringNoodle,If only we could convince blizzard to up them to 50% and 100% respectively ;)
07-08-2019T21:19:28,Bgrmystr2,"honestly, any kind of gambling in that respect is bad imo"
07-08-2019T21:19:58,AspiringNoodle,My biggest complaint is actually the time limit on holiday skins
07-08-2019T21:20:16,AspiringNoodle,You can only earn them during the 3 weeks the event is live
07-08-2019T21:21:07,AspiringNoodle,I'd prefer it if they got added to the regular loot table at some point
07-08-2019T21:21:39,CrRAR,yeah I don't like the trend of temporary exclusives in technology.
07-08-2019T21:22:13,AspiringNoodle,So here's the breakdown on Overwatch exclusives
07-08-2019T21:22:29,AspiringNoodle,"Common - Epic, nobody gives a shit.  Legendaries have a drop rate of about 1 in every 12 boxes"
07-08-2019T21:22:46,AspiringNoodle,I already gave out the coin drops for dupes / chests
07-08-2019T21:23:16,AspiringNoodle,Holiday skins added to the loot table for that holiday cost 3x the normal price
07-08-2019T21:23:35,AspiringNoodle,"You get a second chance in a given year at them during the anniversary event, when all holiday skins are unlockable"
07-08-2019T21:23:48,AspiringNoodle,"After a year has passed, holiday skins cost normal price"
07-08-2019T21:24:18,AspiringNoodle,"Players earn 1 box per level, and can earn an addition 3 boxes per week from winning 9 arcade games, and in the event of new arcade modes, 1 box for the first match"
07-08-2019T21:25:12,AspiringNoodle,"Still lootboxes, but Blizzard has done what they can to make them pretty consumer friendly"
07-08-2019T21:25:43,AspiringNoodle,"On that note, inb4 Activision tomfuckery"
07-08-2019T21:33:50,AspiringNoodle,"I just learned the most useless fact from Dark Souls 3, and I love it"
07-08-2019T21:47:49,AspiringNoodle,*refreshes order tracking for 50th time today*

07-08-2019T22:03:52,AspiringNoodle,It should not take until monday to get them to their final destination xD
07-08-2019T22:05:28,RimaDraws,lol they have a weird thing like that
