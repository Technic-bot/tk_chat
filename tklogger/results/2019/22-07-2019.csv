22-07-2019T11:00:13,AspiringNoodle,Normal use can be described as a 2 or a 3
22-07-2019T11:00:16,AspiringNoodle,Gaming is 11
22-07-2019T11:01:00,AspiringNoodle,"My iGPU can do 1080p60 as a max supported resolution, but to play Overwatch I need to set all the settings to low and the resolution to 360p"
22-07-2019T11:01:39,Yevni,:upsidedownsmile:
22-07-2019T11:16:44,CrimsonQuill,Ouch
22-07-2019T11:19:58,AspiringNoodle,"Yeah... This GPU isn't too powerful, lol"
22-07-2019T11:20:13,AspiringNoodle,It's from a 2012 intel processor.
22-07-2019T11:20:38,CrimsonQuill,Intel seems to be the bottom line for processors and cards
22-07-2019T11:20:48,AspiringNoodle,"Even if I had a modern intel processor with integrated graphics, it still wouldn't be as powerful as what AMD offers"
22-07-2019T11:21:17,AspiringNoodle,"But on the flipside, AMD only includes integrated graphics with their lowest-end processors"
22-07-2019T11:21:22,AspiringNoodle,"Sooooo, mixed bag"
22-07-2019T11:21:35,CrimsonQuill,Oooook
22-07-2019T11:22:16,AspiringNoodle,Ryzen 3 2200g (4c/4t) comes with a Vega 8 APU
22-07-2019T11:22:26,AspiringNoodle,2400g (4c/8t) comes with a Vega 11
22-07-2019T11:22:40,CrimsonQuill,How much are those?
22-07-2019T11:22:45,AspiringNoodle,"If you buy a 9900k, it comes with I believe a UHD 630"
22-07-2019T11:23:01,AspiringNoodle,Somewhere around the $120 mark for the 400g
22-07-2019T11:23:16,CrimsonQuill,Very expensive...
22-07-2019T11:23:28,AspiringNoodle,"lol, ""expensive"""
22-07-2019T11:23:47,AspiringNoodle,"In the CPU market, ~$100 is considered budget"
22-07-2019T11:24:24,CrimsonQuill,My friend and I are going to build a decent pc with a budget of 250-350
22-07-2019T11:24:31,CrimsonQuill,Over a period of time
22-07-2019T11:24:35,AspiringNoodle,That's gonna be a lot of used part / outdated part shopping
22-07-2019T11:24:41,CrimsonQuill,Yeah
22-07-2019T11:24:53,AspiringNoodle,It's hard to build a decent new computer with even a budget of $600
22-07-2019T11:25:00,CrimsonQuill,It just needs to do the job
22-07-2019T11:25:25,AspiringNoodle,Don't ask how much I saved... lol
22-07-2019T11:25:46,AspiringNoodle,Because I'm having a hard time bringing myself to spend all of that
22-07-2019T11:25:47,Yevni,imagine how well $300 rig in 10 years would be though. probably 4k easy
22-07-2019T11:26:20,AspiringNoodle,It wouldn't surprise me.  We're hitting a point where the top-end GPU's can run 4k60 at max settings on a single card
22-07-2019T11:26:30,CrimsonQuill,gtg
22-07-2019T11:26:31,CrimsonQuill,dinner
22-07-2019T11:26:42,Yevni,i want dinner
22-07-2019T11:26:44,Yevni,and breakfast
22-07-2019T11:26:49,Yevni,food in general
22-07-2019T11:26:51,AspiringNoodle,I'm eating lunch <3
22-07-2019T11:27:16,AspiringNoodle,"That said, 4k60 is not an absolute atm.  There are some titles at max that push 1440p near 60 fps"
22-07-2019T11:28:09,AspiringNoodle,I'm going for a 2080 super because there's major diminishing returns after that point xD
22-07-2019T11:28:27,AspiringNoodle,The 2080 ti will be 15 - 20% more performance for 50% more
22-07-2019T11:29:02,AspiringNoodle,"I guess the true can be said of every tier, though.  2070 -> 2080 is about a 40% price increase for the typical 15%+ improvement"
22-07-2019T11:29:16,AspiringNoodle,...I forget how to english for a moment
22-07-2019T12:16:49,Mippy,:ctwokinds-nibrun:
22-07-2019T12:17:13,CrimsonQuill,Hi Mippy
22-07-2019T12:17:22,CrimsonQuill,:ctwokinds-rainehappy:
22-07-2019T12:18:06,BadFoMo,Yo.
22-07-2019T12:18:12,CrimsonQuill,Hi BadFoMo
22-07-2019T12:18:20,Mippy,So...I went to watch the street performers on Sunday. There is a tinge of regret. I got sun fucked
22-07-2019T12:18:39,CrimsonQuill,Ouch
22-07-2019T12:18:43,CrimsonQuill,Skin burns?
22-07-2019T12:19:06,Mippy,Yupper. Pretty bad. I‚Äôm like a vampire
22-07-2019T12:19:37,CrimsonQuill,That must hurt
22-07-2019T12:19:44,BadFoMo,My 'friend' is like that too.
22-07-2019T12:20:00,Mippy,I‚Äôve been bathing in aloe gel
22-07-2019T12:20:07,CrimsonQuill,Any good?
22-07-2019T12:20:26,AspiringNoodle,"Haha, basement dwellers unite!"
22-07-2019T12:20:32,AspiringNoodle,For the sun is our mutual enemy :D
22-07-2019T12:21:00,CrimsonQuill,"To quote UpIsNotJump, ""Damn you sun!"""
22-07-2019T12:21:25,Mippy,Really soothing when you put it in the fridge. Keeps the burn moisturizer so you don‚Äôt get the tight pulling and breaking
22-07-2019T12:21:40,CrimsonQuill,Nice.
22-07-2019T12:22:26,CrimsonQuill,I am literally in a basement
22-07-2019T12:22:29,CrimsonQuill,It's my room
22-07-2019T12:22:31,CrimsonQuill,Nice and cool
22-07-2019T12:22:42,Mippy,I‚Äôm at the staff table at work
22-07-2019T12:23:24,Mippy,We don‚Äôt actually have a staff room. It‚Äôs just a table in the hall
22-07-2019T12:24:00,CrimsonQuill,Oh dear
22-07-2019T12:24:11,CrimsonQuill,I'm about to fly a spaceship in Elite Dangeorus
22-07-2019T12:24:14,CrimsonQuill,Fun
22-07-2019T12:24:47,Mippy,I have to punch in. üëã
22-07-2019T12:28:46,CrimsonQuill,Cya soon Mippy
22-07-2019T16:38:10,SniperJackal,Oh that reminds me
22-07-2019T16:38:16,SniperJackal,I also gotta build a new pc
22-07-2019T16:38:16,CrimsonQuill,"Well, they have a spare case and hardrive that they're tossing in"
22-07-2019T16:38:24,CrimsonQuill,And I have a monitor
22-07-2019T16:38:26,CrimsonQuill,And a mouse
22-07-2019T16:38:27,SpazztasticKiwi,so you‚Äôre saying saxophoners have great tongue game
22-07-2019T16:38:46,Yevni,that's like saying a bassist got good finger game
22-07-2019T16:38:48,Bgrmystr2,I severely hope you guys use CrystalDiskInfo to confirm the drive isn't failing.
22-07-2019T16:38:49,SniperJackal,Need to build one at least until the end of 2020
22-07-2019T16:39:01,Bgrmystr2,"Kinda sorta, Kiwi xD"
22-07-2019T16:39:10,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve always heard woodwinds are good at blowing
22-07-2019T16:39:17,Yevni,tbh prob true
22-07-2019T16:39:20,SpazztasticKiwi,and drummers sure can bang
22-07-2019T16:39:36,Bgrmystr2,You need a hella good set of lungs to be a professional for woodwinds
22-07-2019T16:39:57,Bgrmystr2,and your tongue muscle will probably strengthen due to that as well
22-07-2019T16:40:05,TeapotOfDoom,:ctwokinds-MikeLewd:
22-07-2019T16:40:18,SpazztasticKiwi,whatever do you mean ‚Äúlewd‚Äù
22-07-2019T16:40:19,Bgrmystr2,ability is debatable. :ptv-ohmy:
22-07-2019T16:40:35,TeapotOfDoom,I said nothing.
22-07-2019T16:40:37,SpazztasticKiwi,we‚Äôre just discussing the innocent strengths of musicians
22-07-2019T16:40:51,TeapotOfDoom,Did you hear anything from my side?
22-07-2019T16:41:17,Bgrmystr2,sure saw somethin.
22-07-2019T16:42:17,TeapotOfDoom,Also quill i believe i think you can build something for 350‚Ç¨. Won't be amazing but i think it will at least run
22-07-2019T16:42:26,CrimsonQuill,That's the idea
22-07-2019T16:42:34,TeapotOfDoom,I didn't
22-07-2019T16:42:35,CrimsonQuill,I can wait a bit before it's godlike
22-07-2019T16:42:45,TeapotOfDoom,You sure you did?
22-07-2019T16:42:45,CrimsonQuill,I just want to be able to play a few games better
22-07-2019T16:42:50,Dadrobit,"Though I'm gonna have to disagree on ""you wouldn't even get a good car for 5 grand,"" yeah, ‚Ç¨350 is just not enough. You're choking yourself out so hard at that price that you likely wouldn't even have an upgrade path that doesn't amount to an entirely new"
22-07-2019T16:43:00,CrimsonQuill,And run Autocad and the photogrammetric software
22-07-2019T16:43:01,Dadrobit,new build
22-07-2019T16:43:22,CrimsonQuill,"Also, sales"
22-07-2019T16:43:26,CrimsonQuill,Sales are happening
22-07-2019T16:43:31,TeapotOfDoom,Depends on your requirements
22-07-2019T16:43:32,Bgrmystr2,"that includes sales, quill, I've said that."
22-07-2019T16:43:33,CrimsonQuill,I'm trusting my friend on this
22-07-2019T16:43:54,Bgrmystr2,"I've never seen cars that didn't need extensive work for 5 grand or less, dadro lol"
22-07-2019T16:43:59,CrimsonQuill,They're very good with computers
22-07-2019T16:44:05,TeapotOfDoom,You will not have an upgrade path. At all. You will not have resell value. That one's for sure
22-07-2019T16:44:17,Bgrmystr2,^ both of that.
22-07-2019T16:45:15,TeapotOfDoom,I've seen some low end hardware run some stuff i think 700gen nvidia and 4th gen intel stuff could work
22-07-2019T16:45:17,CrimsonQuill,So you're saying that there's no way to build a decent desktop with ‚Ç¨350
22-07-2019T16:45:37,CrimsonQuill,It's acting as a base off which I can upgrade over time
22-07-2019T16:45:49,Bgrmystr2,"the direct translation right now for that would be $390, and no very unlikely."
22-07-2019T16:45:50,TeapotOfDoom,Decent depends on the tasks you use it for
22-07-2019T16:46:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"since he‚Äôs shown up, is it too out of place to throw in a ‚Äúlisten to your father‚Äù?"
22-07-2019T16:46:19,CrimsonQuill,Well the most I want to be able to do is run Doom 2016 on low-medium settings
22-07-2019T16:46:27,Bgrmystr2,"My dad's not here, so that doesn't apply to me thx, kiwi :u"
22-07-2019T16:46:30,CrimsonQuill,"It does run on this laptop, but with a lot of laf"
22-07-2019T16:46:31,CrimsonQuill,lag
22-07-2019T16:46:35,CrimsonQuill,And heat
22-07-2019T16:47:07,Bgrmystr2,"see if you have a goal, you can look for requirements and instead of going for pricing, look for specific parts as a base"
22-07-2019T16:47:13,TeapotOfDoom,I still use the exact setup i talked about and it's still quite decent
22-07-2019T16:47:14,Bgrmystr2,and then try to find the lowest price you get them
22-07-2019T16:47:24,CrimsonQuill,"And this is a potato with 12gb ram, an SSD and a godawful default graphics chip intel wossname"
22-07-2019T16:47:27,TeapotOfDoom,It will however not be upgradable
22-07-2019T16:47:29,SpazztasticKiwi,wasn‚Äôt referring it to you
22-07-2019T16:48:00,SniperJackal,potato with 12gb ram? I have 6gb
22-07-2019T16:48:27,SniperJackal,12gb isnt exactly potato
22-07-2019T16:48:28,TeapotOfDoom,If you don't want potatoe quality you'll probably have to use last gen...
22-07-2019T16:48:40,TeapotOfDoom,Which kills upgradability
22-07-2019T16:49:09,CrimsonQuill,It is when the card is the default in the laptop
22-07-2019T16:49:22,CrimsonQuill,"Also, 'last gen'/"
22-07-2019T16:49:50,TeapotOfDoom,Hold on a sek i have to practice my chinese or duolingo will kill me. Then i'll scout for parts. I have an idea that might just work. No promises tho
22-07-2019T16:51:15,SpazztasticKiwi,ü¶â ‚Äúfear the learning‚Äù
22-07-2019T16:51:16,CrimsonQuill,"My friend's on it, it's ok"
22-07-2019T16:52:19,Bgrmystr2,"Honestly I think you have a fundamental misunderstanding of both pricing and for what is ""decent"" and ""upgradable"""
22-07-2019T16:53:03,CrimsonQuill,"Perhaps, Perhaps not."
22-07-2019T16:53:12,CrimsonQuill,All I know is that I need to head to bed

22-07-2019T16:57:45,Dadrobit,https://pcpartpicker.com/list/y4P9sZ There. Bare ass requirements for Doom 2016 assuming you have a compatible case and a hard drive.
22-07-2019T16:58:40,Dadrobit,"Still $100 over what you've got to spend, and it is unfortunately not upgradable in any reasonable manner."
22-07-2019T16:59:09,Bgrmystr2,doesn't come with a monitor or mouse or keyboard
22-07-2019T16:59:15,CrimsonQuill,Oh! Just saw this as I was about to log off
22-07-2019T16:59:18,CrimsonQuill,Thanks Robit
22-07-2019T16:59:21,Bgrmystr2,"since he's using a laptop, there's no guarantee he has any of that"
22-07-2019T16:59:23,CrimsonQuill,I'll take notes
22-07-2019T16:59:30,CrimsonQuill,"Again, night"
22-07-2019T16:59:34,CrimsonQuill,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
22-07-2019T16:59:40,Dadrobit,"MAYBE you can get it down $100 with sales, but still, it's not upgradable so you're upgrade path after this = completely new computer."
22-07-2019T16:59:47,Bgrmystr2,but yeah $500 is much more reasonable
22-07-2019T17:00:09,Dadrobit,"He said he had a case, mouse, monitor, and hard drive earlier that I'm assuming has an OS."
22-07-2019T17:00:42,Bgrmystr2,not that I saw

22-07-2019T17:02:00,SpazztasticKiwi,so this man just posted he got a single mom at the gym he visits fired as the personal trainer she was and now thinks he was an ass for doing so
22-07-2019T17:02:06,Bgrmystr2,for 2ndhand stuff
22-07-2019T17:02:13,Bgrmystr2,meaning included in the price
22-07-2019T17:02:19,SpazztasticKiwi,what he did was report her posts making fun of overweight gym goers
22-07-2019T17:03:34,SpazztasticKiwi,the logic hurts
22-07-2019T17:06:43,TeapotOfDoom,He got her fired because she made fun of overweight people?

22-07-2019T17:15:04,SpazztasticKiwi,you know sometimes I wonder if autocorrect knows grammar itself
22-07-2019T17:18:31,TeapotOfDoom,I don't think so...
22-07-2019T17:19:23,TeapotOfDoom,Basic versions of it at least but the predictive stuff has become quite impressive tbh
22-07-2019T17:19:43,TeapotOfDoom,Still i don't use it. Doesn't play well with dialect
22-07-2019T17:21:35,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs bad when you have autocorrect to help with strange words but you have to fix its help
22-07-2019T17:22:09,SpazztasticKiwi,like how it loves changing its to it‚Äôs
22-07-2019T17:22:41,SpazztasticKiwi,like an over enthusiastic charades player

22-07-2019T17:32:07,TeapotOfDoom,They're arguing?
22-07-2019T17:32:32,SpazztasticKiwi,no the kids are just playing around and are apparently being allowed to be as loud as they please
22-07-2019T17:34:43,TeapotOfDoom,Well that depends on the situation
22-07-2019T17:35:34,TeapotOfDoom,But i guess it's not really appropriate in this instance?

22-07-2019T17:36:16,SpazztasticKiwi,I tolerated it at first but I have a limit and I‚Äôm trying to type
22-07-2019T17:37:12,SpazztasticKiwi,admittedly they‚Äôre cute and kids but I just can‚Äôt
22-07-2019T17:37:32,TeapotOfDoom,Understandable.
22-07-2019T17:38:08,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs possible I have a sensory sensitivity but who knows
22-07-2019T17:38:25,TeapotOfDoom,Also why are they being chaotic in a restaurant?
22-07-2019T17:38:37,SpazztasticKiwi,I guess they‚Äôre just little
22-07-2019T17:38:59,SpazztasticKiwi,well the girl was. Just walking kind of age. The boys were older
22-07-2019T17:39:10,SpazztasticKiwi,they were tossing the toys back n forth
22-07-2019T17:39:25,TeapotOfDoom,Pure and utter chaos ^^
22-07-2019T17:40:33,TeapotOfDoom,Well yeah hard to blame them but not that great if one wants to work
22-07-2019T17:40:47,SpazztasticKiwi,did you mean: ‚Äúyoung children in a nutshell‚Äù
22-07-2019T17:40:58,TeapotOfDoom,Yes
22-07-2019T17:41:05,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs why I‚Äôve told people I don‚Äôt want kids
22-07-2019T17:41:17,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs literally because I swear I‚Äôd be a bad mom
22-07-2019T17:41:28,TeapotOfDoom,Haha who knows
22-07-2019T17:41:52,TeapotOfDoom,I would not dare to assume either way about me
22-07-2019T17:42:11,TeapotOfDoom,I'll see. Maybe one day
22-07-2019T17:43:19,SpazztasticKiwi,‚Äúoh but what if your husbands ready to start a family‚Äù
22-07-2019T17:43:41,TeapotOfDoom,That's a hard question
22-07-2019T17:43:45,SpazztasticKiwi,well he‚Äôs welcome to have his own kids until I‚Äôm ready - I‚Äôll be there when they‚Äôre born
22-07-2019T17:45:05,TeapotOfDoom,"Anyway, I'm hitting the hay. G'night :ctwokinds-RainezZz:"
22-07-2019T17:45:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Mmmk
22-07-2019T17:45:43,TeapotOfDoom,Work again tomorrow...
22-07-2019T17:46:01,SpazztasticKiwi,otherwise he can cool his heels. Men can sire well into their 80s and 90s by last report. women are good till about their late 30s
22-07-2019T17:46:19,SpazztasticKiwi,My eggs may have a sell by date but it‚Äôs not anytime soon
22-07-2019T17:46:45,SpazztasticKiwi,oh they got me for early tomorrow
22-07-2019T17:47:08,SpazztasticKiwi,but it‚Äôs either that or swap and close with ‚Äútakes his time‚Äù
22-07-2019T17:47:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm picking my demon
22-07-2019T17:47:22,TeapotOfDoom,Good thing i reminded you ^^
22-07-2019T17:48:41,TeapotOfDoom,Also the kids question is one not to be worried about to soon imo. Everything has a right time to be worried about
22-07-2019T17:48:59,SpazztasticKiwi,you know I‚Äôve seen people take two parking spots and I‚Äôve seen people take two spots cause they‚Äôre just ~that~ much over the line
22-07-2019T17:49:13,TeapotOfDoom,Edgy
22-07-2019T17:49:44,SpazztasticKiwi,but this lady may be the first I‚Äôve seen take two spots by just being purely diagonal with her parking
22-07-2019T17:50:01,TeapotOfDoom,Wait. What?
22-07-2019T17:50:11,SpazztasticKiwi,back end is in one spot front end is in the other
22-07-2019T17:50:12,TeapotOfDoom,You got me interested
22-07-2019T17:50:22,TeapotOfDoom,So much for going to bed
22-07-2019T17:50:32,SpazztasticKiwi,she‚Äôs in her car though about to leave so I can‚Äôt do pictures
22-07-2019T17:50:41,TeapotOfDoom,Damn
22-07-2019T17:50:50,TeapotOfDoom,But why?
22-07-2019T17:51:06,SpazztasticKiwi,laziness if I had to guess
22-07-2019T17:51:07,TeapotOfDoom,Why would one consider doing this
22-07-2019T17:51:43,SpazztasticKiwi,can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve seen a car half still in the drive lane between parking rows because they didn‚Äôt pull in all the way
22-07-2019T17:51:54,TeapotOfDoom,I mean if the entire lot is empty and i yust have to jump out for 10sek yeah
22-07-2019T17:52:01,TeapotOfDoom,But any other time
22-07-2019T17:52:40,SpazztasticKiwi,bad joke but some people‚Äôs pull out game is so strong they can‚Äôt park right
22-07-2019T17:52:48,TeapotOfDoom,Lol
22-07-2019T17:53:15,TeapotOfDoom,That one i will archive for later use
22-07-2019T17:53:55,SpazztasticKiwi,distantly I find myself thinking ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry for your partner‚Äù when I see it
22-07-2019T17:54:38,SpazztasticKiwi,"though I‚Äôd hate to outright say it‚Äôs all men‚Äôs cars, I‚Äôll also admit is generally the big fancy trucks and sports cars"
22-07-2019T17:54:57,TeapotOfDoom,Is the prejudice that women can't park right international?
22-07-2019T17:55:23,IronHorseComics,I've seen plenty of men who can't park worth a crap
22-07-2019T17:55:24,SpazztasticKiwi,some people bring it up when they see a bad driver that ends up being a woman
22-07-2019T17:55:39,IronHorseComics,though it's funny you mention that
22-07-2019T17:55:48,Sclimshady,"Gonna be honest, my truck is too big for parking spaces"
22-07-2019T17:56:01,TeapotOfDoom,Honk honk
22-07-2019T17:56:35,TeapotOfDoom,I parked an ambulance for nine months. After that you know how to park any car
22-07-2019T17:56:35,SpazztasticKiwi,around here you‚Äôll get asked if you got your license out a cereal box regardless what sex you are if you so much as forget a turn signal
22-07-2019T17:56:48,IronHorseComics,"when my mom and I went to go see Hotel Transylvania (or How to Train your Dragon), we went in the Jeep I had and we needed to go to a market place for some reason..."
22-07-2019T17:56:56,Bgrmystr2,"I think the stigma in the US at least comes from the fact that noone's willing to actually teach women how to drive / park because ""they can't"" and thus leading to less women having the chance to learn to begin with"
22-07-2019T17:57:02,Sclimshady,We always left our ambulance on the curb
22-07-2019T17:57:33,Bgrmystr2,"and I don't mean from a driving school, I mean from people who enjoy cars as a passion."
22-07-2019T17:57:54,Bgrmystr2,it's always been a boy's club type deal
22-07-2019T17:58:09,SpazztasticKiwi,only reason I learned stick was YouTube
22-07-2019T17:58:27,IronHorseComics,"when we came back out, some woman had parked her car so close to mine, it was like six inches away and badly angled. To this day I have no clue how she didn't scrape the whole side of my car, but we had to go back inside and..."
22-07-2019T17:58:30,Bgrmystr2,"push all the girls out of it and then wonder why none of em are good with it? No shit, dug their own hole there."
22-07-2019T17:58:37,SpazztasticKiwi,had a boyfriend offer to teach me at one point but I said nah at the time
22-07-2019T17:59:14,SpazztasticKiwi,highly doubt I‚Äôd be good at it but I know the bells and whistles at least
22-07-2019T17:59:17,IronHorseComics,ask one of the ladies to call out to have this person move her car and fortunately she came rather quickly and moved her car
22-07-2019T17:59:23,Sclimshady,"My clutch is way too expensive for anyone to learn on, take that stuff to the 500 dollar honda"
22-07-2019T17:59:53,IronHorseComics,"it was a nice car too, I think it was a newer (at the time) either BMW or cadillac"
22-07-2019T18:00:07,SpazztasticKiwi,not entirely sure if he was so happy to try teaching me because it‚Äôs a skill or if he wanted me in his lap
22-07-2019T18:00:19,Sclimshady,:ctwokinds-MikeLewd:
22-07-2019T18:00:29,SpazztasticKiwi,regardless i didn‚Äôt want to put it in a ditch
22-07-2019T18:00:55,IronHorseComics,"no no, learn on a Volkswagen the transmissions on those thing are so forgiving"
22-07-2019T18:00:56,Bgrmystr2,":ptv-laugh: into the ditch it went though, as expected. xD"
22-07-2019T18:01:29,Sclimshady,I taught a guy once and he almost put us into a minefield so that was shortlived
22-07-2019T18:01:42,TeapotOfDoom,Volkswagen. Das Auto.
22-07-2019T18:01:59,SpazztasticKiwi,‚Äúok so not you just gently ease into the brake‚Äù
22-07-2019T18:02:10,SpazztasticKiwi,*floors gas petel*
22-07-2019T18:02:15,TeapotOfDoom,Wow than escalated quickly sclim
22-07-2019T18:02:30,SpazztasticKiwi,‚Äúwe are never doing that again‚Äù
22-07-2019T18:03:14,TeapotOfDoom,Our ambulance car was a modified volkswagen transporter t5 or t6
22-07-2019T18:03:17,SpazztasticKiwi,dude from work says he wants a motorcycle
22-07-2019T18:03:24,Sclimshady,"If you have ever driven a Tata you will know that no one could ever learn on that ""clutch"""
22-07-2019T18:03:35,TeapotOfDoom,Druves just like a regular car but twice the size
22-07-2019T18:03:44,Bgrmystr2,my feet are twitchy so braking is something I'm not good with
22-07-2019T18:03:45,SpazztasticKiwi,that‚Äôs all his mess but all I could say was ‚Äúnothing like a 70mph bath‚Äù
22-07-2019T18:03:48,Bgrmystr2,I'm fine with everything else though
22-07-2019T18:04:48,SpazztasticKiwi,in general it‚Äôs not you that‚Äôs the problem on the road
22-07-2019T18:05:00,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs the fact you gotta watch everyone else
22-07-2019T18:05:15,Sclimshady,Our department had a really cool 4x4 ambulance that was really hard to get assigned to but it was the coolest thing ever
22-07-2019T18:05:51,SpazztasticKiwi,ah yes. Mudding in a wee woo wagon
22-07-2019T18:06:45,SpazztasticKiwi,and I‚Äôll also have you know I never put that bfs truck in a ditch
22-07-2019T18:06:46,TeapotOfDoom,Driving these things is fun. The reason you do mostly isn't but still you gotta take what you get
22-07-2019T18:06:47,Sclimshady,"We cover the Oceano dunes so it was pretty important, but I do that stuff for fun so yeah i'll get paid for it"
22-07-2019T18:06:51,SpazztasticKiwi,I never tried driving it
22-07-2019T18:07:00,SpazztasticKiwi,can‚Äôt wreak it if you don‚Äôt drive it
22-07-2019T18:07:15,SpazztasticKiwi,in other news I can‚Äôt spell a damn thing
22-07-2019T18:07:24,Sclimshady,But if you don't break something was it even worth it?
22-07-2019T18:07:44,TeapotOfDoom,Break the law lol
22-07-2019T18:08:01,SpazztasticKiwi,it was paid for I‚Äôm not entirely sure he‚Äôd have been happy about losing it
22-07-2019T18:08:03,TeapotOfDoom,I think eveyone of us knows that feeling spazz
22-07-2019T18:08:59,TeapotOfDoom,So you did you learn how to drive stick in the end spazz?
22-07-2019T18:09:07,SpazztasticKiwi,not with him
22-07-2019T18:09:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I leaned myself later
22-07-2019T18:09:29,SpazztasticKiwi,l e a r n e d
22-07-2019T18:09:37,TeapotOfDoom,^^
22-07-2019T18:09:56,SpazztasticKiwi,my keyboard is not feeling it today
22-07-2019T18:10:11,SpazztasticKiwi,and by it I mean my fingers
22-07-2019T18:10:17,TeapotOfDoom,After killing the engine for the first couple of times it's not that bad
22-07-2019T18:10:36,SpazztasticKiwi,now while I‚Äôll say I‚Äôve learned it I‚Äôve yet to try it
22-07-2019T18:10:38,Sclimshady,"Honestly, the Forester has a really easy transmission.  It took me 5 minutes to learn on it"
22-07-2019T18:10:43,SpazztasticKiwi,so
22-07-2019T18:11:21,TeapotOfDoom,"If you ever visit europe, you'll prob need that skill"
22-07-2019T18:11:38,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt aim to drive if I visit Europe
22-07-2019T18:11:49,SpazztasticKiwi,uber
22-07-2019T18:12:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôd also aim to be with someone if I go
22-07-2019T18:12:22,TeapotOfDoom,Depends on where you're going
22-07-2019T18:13:01,TeapotOfDoom,It only exists in the bigger cities
22-07-2019T18:13:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve got a bit of morbid curiosity for the red light district but that would be a ‚ÄúI‚Äôll glance around the corner and I‚Äôm done‚Äù thing
22-07-2019T18:14:02,SpazztasticKiwi,other than that it‚Äôs try the food and visit shops
22-07-2019T18:14:20,TeapotOfDoom,My then fiance didn't want to go in
22-07-2019T18:15:03,SpazztasticKiwi,"from what I‚Äôve heard when you go and if you‚Äôre male, they flock to you"
22-07-2019T18:15:09,TeapotOfDoom,If you're talking about amsterdam visit the foodhallen if you ever go. It's an amazing place
22-07-2019T18:15:14,SpazztasticKiwi,some will wonder to the ladies but
22-07-2019T18:16:00,SpazztasticKiwi,most women in a couple don‚Äôt want to visit because they don‚Äôt want their partner mobbed
22-07-2019T18:16:10,TeapotOfDoom,Lol
22-07-2019T18:17:19,SpazztasticKiwi,and because there‚Äôs also stories that suggest ‚ÄúI‚Äôm with him‚Äù doesn‚Äôt dissuade some of the workers from saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm game‚Äù
22-07-2019T18:17:54,TeapotOfDoom,All is fair in love and war
22-07-2019T18:18:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm ok with others doing I don‚Äôt care to learn with whoever as long as it‚Äôs legal age and everyone‚Äôs good with it
22-07-2019T18:18:11,TeapotOfDoom,Still i think doing that is kinda to much
22-07-2019T18:18:12,SpazztasticKiwi,but I don‚Äôt share
22-07-2019T18:18:40,TeapotOfDoom,Fair enough ^^
22-07-2019T18:19:01,TeapotOfDoom,I wouldn't either
22-07-2019T18:20:29,TeapotOfDoom,I should really go to bed now...
22-07-2019T18:20:39,TeapotOfDoom,Night! :ctwokinds-RainezZz:
22-07-2019T18:25:50,AspiringNoodle,Good god
22-07-2019T18:25:56,AspiringNoodle,I come back to the biggest wall of text evuh
22-07-2019T18:30:28,SpazztasticKiwi,just think how behind Tom‚Äôs gonna be on the conversation
22-07-2019T18:35:42,IronHorseComics,assuming he decides to visit today
22-07-2019T18:35:51,IronHorseComics,he's gotta be dog tired
22-07-2019T18:36:00,AspiringNoodle,"I came home after Teapot went offline, and ofc he picked up on my gpu talk :c"
22-07-2019T18:37:04,SpazztasticKiwi,who knows maybe he‚Äôs sticking around in San D
22-07-2019T18:37:25,SpazztasticKiwi,"‚ÄúIf I stay here, my workload can‚Äôt find me‚Äù"
22-07-2019T18:42:30,IronHorseComics,"and then the work mysteriously finds him ""You can never escape me!"""
22-07-2019T18:43:11,AspiringNoodle,Cat Nora finds him :P
22-07-2019T18:43:39,AspiringNoodle,"""You haven't been drawing very much.  I can't have my fun if you don't draw."" :ptv-snicker:"
22-07-2019T19:00:01,AspiringNoodle,"Okay, this question likely won't get answere, but I want to know"
22-07-2019T19:00:11,AspiringNoodle,Anybody here use ASUS hardwarein their computers?
22-07-2019T19:00:25,AspiringNoodle,"If so, have you had any issues with them, and what was your customer service experience like?"
22-07-2019T19:00:37,IronHorseComics,I have an ASUS LCD monitor
22-07-2019T19:00:49,IronHorseComics,never had any real issues with it
22-07-2019T19:00:51,Bgrmystr2,My motherboard is ASUS
22-07-2019T19:01:06,Bgrmystr2,and I've been running it since 2009
22-07-2019T19:01:52,Bgrmystr2,"nothing problematic till recently, power delivery errors, but not sure if it's from CPU or ram, or the board itself. It's very rare though so I feel like it may be due to something I don't know of happening in the background"
22-07-2019T19:04:21,AspiringNoodle,Well that's good to know
22-07-2019T19:04:44,AspiringNoodle,"I'm more curious about recent ASUS products.  Supposedly they've been riding the high since 2013, and quality / CS has slipped"
22-07-2019T19:05:02,AspiringNoodle,"That said... I've never used them, and I'm willing to give them a chance!"
22-07-2019T19:06:08,AspiringNoodle,Not to mention the biggest tech channels still use ASUS products almost religiously
22-07-2019T19:17:55,Xexanoth,"the only bad experience i ever had with asus was their software, back when windows 7 came out it took em like a year to update their graphics card driver to be compatible"
22-07-2019T19:18:43,Xexanoth,and even then it crashed regularly.
22-07-2019T19:22:19,AspiringNoodle,Oof
22-07-2019T19:22:33,AspiringNoodle,*checks stock listing*
22-07-2019T19:22:55,AspiringNoodle,"Man, the launch day is almost over and Gigabyte, MSI, and ASUS's premium cards STILL aren't for sale!"
22-07-2019T19:24:03,AspiringNoodle,It's worth pointing out that apparently ASUS's x470 boards had some MAJOR quality issues
22-07-2019T19:24:31,AspiringNoodle,I'm hoping to pair a STRIX GPU with a ROG Crosshair motherboard.  I'm hoping that they fixed the issues for x570 ^^;
22-07-2019T19:35:28,Bgrmystr2,..that seems dumb. Why would you expect there to be a sale on newly released stuff anywhere within 3 or 4 months of launch day?
22-07-2019T19:35:39,Bgrmystr2,you're waiting for something that's obviously not going to happen
22-07-2019T19:36:59,AspiringNoodle,"I said ""for"" sale, not ""on"" sale ;)"
22-07-2019T19:37:24,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: difference being..?
22-07-2019T19:38:15,AspiringNoodle,"First means being available for purchase, the second meaning a discounted price"
22-07-2019T19:38:21,AspiringNoodle,"Don't blame me, blame Engrish"
22-07-2019T19:38:28,Bgrmystr2,"eh, I think you just had bad wording"
22-07-2019T19:38:45,Bgrmystr2,cuz it can be interpreted as discounted both ways
22-07-2019T19:38:47,AspiringNoodle,"Also, context"
22-07-2019T19:38:56,Bgrmystr2,That's including context.
22-07-2019T19:39:02,SpazztasticKiwi,apparently king has decided to discontinue paradise bay
22-07-2019T19:39:11,AspiringNoodle,"""Man, the launch day is almost over and Gigabyte, MSI, and ASUS's premium cards STILL aren't for sale!"""

22-07-2019T19:39:44,AspiringNoodle,"Like... the entire sentence screams ""I WANT TO BUY THESE CARDS, WHY CAN'T I PURCHASE THEM YET?!?"""
22-07-2019T19:40:20,AspiringNoodle,I've been told I overthink things a lot
22-07-2019T19:40:32,AspiringNoodle,And I can honestly say you're overthinking the meaning behind what I said

22-07-2019T19:41:03,AspiringNoodle,Any other person should easily discern the intent behind my exclamation!
22-07-2019T19:41:14,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-SteelwormHades: We can agree to Engrish.

22-07-2019T19:41:46,AspiringNoodle,"Then again, it's like the only manufacturer that had its entire stack available for launch"

22-07-2019T19:41:58,Bgrmystr2,Likely far and few between

22-07-2019T19:43:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera was just snoozin under the blankies
22-07-2019T19:43:35,AspiringNoodle,"While if someone talks about buying something while it's ""on sale"" implies a discount"
22-07-2019T19:43:58,Bgrmystr2,Sorry I'm not a commoner? :V :ptv-confused:
22-07-2019T19:44:08,AspiringNoodle,It's also how various acronyms can mean different things depending on what you're talking about

22-07-2019T19:50:23,SpazztasticKiwi,you know they got a full easter island head but they cut the statue of liberty in half for her emoji
22-07-2019T19:50:26,Bgrmystr2,Or apple could stop hiding behind a wall of superiority complex
22-07-2019T19:50:34,Bgrmystr2,yknow.. one or the other
22-07-2019T19:51:51,SpazztasticKiwi,so far the only ones I‚Äôve heard bragging about any kind of superiority is android users
22-07-2019T19:52:09,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve yet to come across but one apple bragger
22-07-2019T19:52:56,Bgrmystr2,"Did you see where apple tried to make people pay what, a thousand dollars for a stand?"
22-07-2019T19:53:01,Bgrmystr2,yeah..
22-07-2019T19:53:14,AspiringNoodle,"I'm sorry, but there is not $1000 worth of engineering in that stand"
22-07-2019T19:53:46,AspiringNoodle,"$5000 for the monitor... debatable.  It's overpriced, but it still has impressive specs."
22-07-2019T19:53:50,Bgrmystr2,the Apple Tax is the superiority complex. Not the users.
22-07-2019T19:54:10,AspiringNoodle,The users are just the sheeple willing to pay the tax for a sense of superiority ;)
22-07-2019T19:54:11,Bgrmystr2,There's nothing apple is selling in that system that isn't mind-bogglingly overpriced
22-07-2019T19:55:22,SpazztasticKiwi,well that‚Äôs apple
22-07-2019T19:55:40,SpazztasticKiwi,if you‚Äôre dumb enough to buy or have the money that‚Äôs their business
22-07-2019T19:56:04,Bgrmystr2,"perhaps, but that's the very reason apple keeps getting away with ripping people off and making the populous think this is acceptable"
22-07-2019T19:56:37,Bgrmystr2,everyone just buys into it and accepts it. it's not a good thing for the consumers nor the market.
22-07-2019T19:56:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I can‚Äôt see why guys around here pay thousands of dollars for a lift kit and an absolutely stunning paint job just to got mudding every weekend
22-07-2019T19:57:02,Bgrmystr2,the mud isn't gonna ruin the paint job though xD
22-07-2019T19:57:06,SpazztasticKiwi,but if they‚Äôre buying it...
22-07-2019T19:57:18,Bgrmystr2,"nor does it destroy the lift kit either, it's just a bunch of cleaning"
22-07-2019T19:57:26,SpazztasticKiwi,but why get it if you‚Äôre gonna keep it covered in mud
22-07-2019T19:57:37,AspiringNoodle,I think the point Kiwi is making is that they spend all this extra money to make the vehicle look cooler
22-07-2019T19:57:46,Bgrmystr2,they probably don't keep it covered in mud XD
22-07-2019T19:57:49,AspiringNoodle,"And then they just BURY all of it under a thick caking of mud, so you never really see it anyway"
22-07-2019T19:58:12,AspiringNoodle,And you'd be surprised.
22-07-2019T19:58:36,Bgrmystr2,Anyone who actually knows what they're doing isn't going to keep it covered in mud. The stupids do.
22-07-2019T19:58:37,SpazztasticKiwi,I saw a comedian make a good point about those balls trailer hitch ornaments
22-07-2019T19:58:47,Bgrmystr2,"but they, too, are the same as those who buy useless things and never use them."
22-07-2019T19:59:03,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you guys ever see a truck with those things hit a curb and just cringe a little?‚Äù
22-07-2019T19:59:07,Bgrmystr2,"well someone's gotta have the balls, kiwi"
22-07-2019T19:59:16,Bgrmystr2,it may as well be the truck.
22-07-2019T19:59:29,SpazztasticKiwi,it got a laugh out of me
22-07-2019T19:59:40,Bgrmystr2,cuz the owner prolly missed day
22-07-2019T19:59:43,SpazztasticKiwi,cause I‚Äôve been behind a truck with a pair of blue ones
22-07-2019T19:59:47,Bgrmystr2,that day*
22-07-2019T19:59:51,SpazztasticKiwi,and not only did I note the color
22-07-2019T20:00:35,SpazztasticKiwi,but they were waving all over the place with the trucks movement and I was watching thinking ‚Äúthat can‚Äôt be comfortable‚Äù
22-07-2019T20:00:46,SpazztasticKiwi,"till you‚Äôre like, well they‚Äôre not real"
22-07-2019T20:01:39,AspiringNoodle,There was an employee at the one movie theater I used to frequent
22-07-2019T20:01:43,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm waiting for someone to make boob ornament decals for headlights. See how that works out
22-07-2019T20:01:53,AspiringNoodle,They had a little cartman doll attached to the rear of their car so it dragged him around
22-07-2019T20:01:55,Bgrmystr2,bwom
22-07-2019T20:02:25,AspiringNoodle,"Also, ""Not sure if lewd"" :ptv-wondering:"
22-07-2019T20:03:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Almost said ‚Äúit‚Äôs just boobs. Everyone‚Äôs got em‚Äù but then I remember the penis people
22-07-2019T20:03:45,SpazztasticKiwi,though I guess technically everyone does technically have boobs some are just bigger than others
22-07-2019T20:04:18,SpazztasticKiwi,and as for this chat you should know that lewd scrolls across occasionally
22-07-2019T20:05:28,Bgrmystr2,"""Then I remember the penis people "" -Kiwi 2019 :ptv-laugh:"
22-07-2019T20:06:13,SpazztasticKiwi,"oh and you know I saw where someone snapped a picture of a very large stick family decal with a note saying ‚Äúdear God man, stay off her!‚Äù"
22-07-2019T20:07:21,SpazztasticKiwi,"if you haven‚Äôt gotten that I‚Äôm horribly blunt now, you‚Äôre in for a ride"

22-07-2019T20:29:40,AspiringNoodle,Let it be known that BGR wins the GPU price argument
22-07-2019T20:30:05,AspiringNoodle,Looking at reviews for the super series cards (the 2070 super is SOOOOOO close to the 2080 for $200+ less)
22-07-2019T20:30:22,Bgrmystr2,xD
22-07-2019T20:30:28,AspiringNoodle,"And there are some titles where at the highest settings, a 2070 super will just barely guarantee 60 fps at 1080p"
22-07-2019T20:30:38,Bgrmystr2,I ain't been in IT and knowing what's worth purchase for nothin
22-07-2019T20:30:55,AspiringNoodle,"Metro Exodus, highest settings, with a 2070 super, will net you ~72 fps on average"
22-07-2019T20:31:38,AspiringNoodle,"Like, jesus.  There's gonna come a point where game developers are gonna be nuking performance when the graphical improvement doesn't really justify it"

22-07-2019T20:33:41,AspiringNoodle,1070 -> 1080: 31% more cost for 25% more improvement
22-07-2019T20:34:00,AspiringNoodle,2070 -> 2080: 40% more cost for 25% more improvement

22-07-2019T20:34:54,AspiringNoodle,"Soooo, yeah.  Got some food for thought."
22-07-2019T20:42:41,CrRAR,If time has taught me anything it's never buy top tier anything.
22-07-2019T20:42:51,CrRAR,It's all obsolete eventually.
22-07-2019T20:43:56,CrRAR,Plus usually it ends up being the hottest/least efficient just because they're pushing the generation of tech to its limits.
22-07-2019T20:49:03,AspiringNoodle,I'm in a bit of a bind now :/
22-07-2019T20:49:14,CrRAR,whassthat?
22-07-2019T20:49:22,AspiringNoodle,the 2070 super version of the ASUS card is out of stock
22-07-2019T20:49:43,AspiringNoodle,"Well, most of them are, anyways xD"
22-07-2019T20:49:58,AspiringNoodle,It's like... uuuuuuuuuugh.  Don't build a computer when you need one when it's around a hardware launch -_-
22-07-2019T20:50:45,AspiringNoodle,"When it comes to the ROG STRIX card, here's what I can buy at what price points, keeping in mind that the 2070 super is not currently available"
22-07-2019T20:50:52,AspiringNoodle,2070 super: $585
22-07-2019T20:51:07,AspiringNoodle,2080: $720 (after mail-in rebate)
22-07-2019T20:51:13,AspiringNoodle,2080 Super: $790
22-07-2019T20:52:08,CrRAR,Do you really need a brand new card?
22-07-2019T20:52:09,CrRAR,You could always go 2nd hand market save a bunch and pick up one of last gen's sweet performers.
22-07-2019T20:53:08,AspiringNoodle,I plan to hold onto my hardware for a good few years
22-07-2019T20:53:19,CrRAR,Makes sense.
22-07-2019T20:53:51,AspiringNoodle,"Prime example, built my computer in 2013, bought a new gpu / monitor in 2016"
22-07-2019T20:54:03,AspiringNoodle,And I went from a 560 to a 970
22-07-2019T20:56:21,AspiringNoodle,More food for thought.  Apparently the ASUS 2080 was $870 when it first launched.  And now the price has dropped so much.
22-07-2019T20:56:39,CrRAR,"Ooo, Amazon's doing installment payments w/ no interest in those asus rog cards"
22-07-2019T20:56:48,AspiringNoodle,I hate Amazon
22-07-2019T20:56:54,AspiringNoodle,Their search results make no fucking sense
22-07-2019T20:57:24,AspiringNoodle,Is it for the 2080 or 2080 super?  I don't think they have the super up yet
22-07-2019T20:57:39,CrRAR,I can't believe how many dang card editions there are nowadays xD
22-07-2019T20:58:54,CrRAR,"Well, I guess I was always familiar with plain, OC'd, Classified, then the Ti releases."
22-07-2019T20:59:09,CrRAR,Maybe actually there were always a lot of options.
22-07-2019T21:00:47,CrRAR,Have you researched benchmarks? What's the FPS differences between them?
22-07-2019T21:01:14,CrRAR,I always remembered the OC'd ones being tiny differences.
22-07-2019T21:02:01,CrRAR,"It depends too on what resolution you're running, gains scale differently at different rezes. Pay attention to the benchmarks where that varies."
22-07-2019T21:03:15,AspiringNoodle,"At 1440p, it's typically a handful of fps difference between the 2070 super and 2080"
22-07-2019T21:03:27,AspiringNoodle,And the 2080 super is 4 - 9% faster than the og 2080 depending on what you're doing
22-07-2019T21:03:47,AspiringNoodle,"That said, the 2080 super from ASUS I'm looking at is, ironically 8.8% more expensive :P"
22-07-2019T21:06:33,AspiringNoodle,"So at least from an ASUS perspective, once you go up from the 2070 super to the 2080 / 2080 super, you're getting roughly the same cost per fps at the very least :ptv-scratch:"
22-07-2019T21:07:03,AspiringNoodle,"Brain, please stop repeating the same phrase within a sentence.  Thank you and good day :ptv-unimpressed:"
22-07-2019T21:10:53,CrRAR,"You probably already have a killer PSU picked out, but does power requirements jump with the OC'd variants?"
22-07-2019T21:12:49,AspiringNoodle,"Meh, probably not much.  I plan to OC the card further, anyways"
22-07-2019T21:13:45,AspiringNoodle,"Also, I checked stock availability for the 2070 super cards.  I should really reconsider planning to buy one xD"
22-07-2019T21:14:00,AspiringNoodle,As much as I would love to and save like $200.  Apparently that shit sells faster than hotcakes
22-07-2019T21:14:12,AspiringNoodle,First day: Sold out within 3 hours
22-07-2019T21:14:27,AspiringNoodle,"And every day since then it's gone back in stock on Newegg, sold out again with 30 minutes"
22-07-2019T21:19:20,CrRAR,"Yeah, just getting in at that level give a good return on investment as far as performance goes. It buys you a ticket to current gen, which is a huge improvement over what most people have."
22-07-2019T21:20:49,AspiringNoodle,"If the 2080 drops to, say, $650 - 660, then holy shit I'd buy that SOOOOOO fast"
22-07-2019T21:21:02,CrRAR,lol
22-07-2019T21:21:27,AspiringNoodle,But it probably won't happen
22-07-2019T21:21:51,AspiringNoodle,Not unless the stock isn't moving and they want to finally get rid of them
22-07-2019T21:39:23,Bgrmystr2,isn't the new AMD card going toe to toe with the 2080?
22-07-2019T21:41:56,Bgrmystr2,"https://gpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Nvidia-RTX-2080-vs-AMD-RX-5700-XT/4026vs4045 Yeah it is, for $400."
22-07-2019T21:42:10,Bgrmystr2,Should probably be watching that.
22-07-2019T21:42:33,AspiringNoodle,The comparison there doesn't include gaming at all
22-07-2019T21:43:19,CrRAR,Do the new AMD cards have ray tracing tech?
22-07-2019T21:43:38,AspiringNoodle,"They're getting support for it, yes."
22-07-2019T21:43:42,Bgrmystr2,"they don't have dedicated cores to Raytracing like Nvidia's do, but they have support for it"
22-07-2019T21:44:09,AspiringNoodle,AMD tends to offer the better perf/$ metric.  But Nvidia does come with a bunch of extra goodies
22-07-2019T21:44:31,CrRAR,yeah
22-07-2019T21:44:42,AspiringNoodle,"Like the mentioned RT cores, Tensor cores for AI, NVENC for streaming, and then ridiculous driver support from Nvidia"
22-07-2019T21:45:12,AspiringNoodle,I'm also a smidge locked into Nvidia atm because of my g-sync monitor
22-07-2019T21:45:57,AspiringNoodle,"I do plan to alleviate this in the next few years by finally buying a second monitor, but buying a g-sync compatible one :)"
22-07-2019T21:47:26,Bgrmystr2,"back, had to afk due to food and other stuff"
22-07-2019T21:48:09,Bgrmystr2,and your monitor should support freesync if it already supports gsync
22-07-2019T21:48:58,AspiringNoodle,That's... not how it works?
22-07-2019T21:49:05,Dadrobit,"Honestly, I'm looking at the 2070 Super myself for the next jump. It looks to be the prime spot for my budget of excellent power without breaking the bank TOO much."
22-07-2019T21:50:03,Bgrmystr2,the 5700XT is barely behind the 2080 / 2070 Super in gaming
22-07-2019T21:50:15,Bgrmystr2,for a fraction of the price
22-07-2019T21:51:13,Dadrobit,"""A fraction"" Yeah, it's 4/5ths the price."
22-07-2019T21:51:45,Dadrobit,It's $400 and is objectively lacking in next-gen harware components.
22-07-2019T21:52:06,Dadrobit,"It's still a good card, but the 2070 Super looks way more future proofed."
22-07-2019T21:52:30,Bgrmystr2,$400 vs $700 is 4/5?
22-07-2019T21:52:38,Bgrmystr2,not sure how you came to that conclusion
22-07-2019T21:52:52,AspiringNoodle,I think he meant vs the 2070 super
22-07-2019T21:53:19,Dadrobit,Where are you getting $700?
22-07-2019T21:53:22,AspiringNoodle,"Although, if we're comparing MSRP / reference design, then that goes out the window the moment third-party coolers are involved, lol"
22-07-2019T21:53:26,AspiringNoodle,2080/2080super
22-07-2019T21:53:28,Bgrmystr2,for the 2080 sitting on amazon
22-07-2019T21:53:48,Dadrobit,"Yeah, that's why I specifically said the 2070 Super lol."
22-07-2019T21:53:51,AspiringNoodle,I'm doing a doublecheck of NVENC video quality atm
22-07-2019T21:53:51,Bgrmystr2,"it's all $700 average for most cards I see, rest are all more than that"
22-07-2019T21:54:29,Bgrmystr2,Every 2070 Super I see is $650
22-07-2019T21:54:31,AspiringNoodle,"If it's as good as I think it is, I'll just downgrade my CPU choice to the 3700x, buy a 2080 / 2080 super, and then get this build rolling"
22-07-2019T21:54:51,AspiringNoodle,Check newegg.  They're much cheaper.  I think the ROG STRIX is the most expensive at $585
22-07-2019T21:56:37,Bgrmystr2,"Okay, that's fair, but what exactly does the Nvidia card have that the AMD one doesn't, ignoring raytracing that cuts your frames in half lel"
22-07-2019T21:56:40,Bgrmystr2,or PhysiX
22-07-2019T21:56:52,Bgrmystr2,or stuff to make AI which.. gamers don't do..? so.. useless.
22-07-2019T21:57:18,Bgrmystr2,"in terms of actual raw gaming performance, I'm not seeing many benefits"
22-07-2019T21:57:28,Dadrobit,"Yeah, and I'm not purchasing right now. Wait a bit, see if anything good comes out of the Black Friday/Cyber Monday week or so of sales. Failing that, the second hand market is a good bet for deals."
22-07-2019T21:57:46,SpazztasticKiwi,so according to this article green is lucky in Korea
22-07-2019T21:57:59,SpazztasticKiwi,as left field as that is
22-07-2019T21:58:37,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, I say all of that and I'm still using a GTX 760 due to it having PhysX. That's about all I got it for since my CPU is absolutely incapable of running it and the game."
22-07-2019T21:59:18,Bgrmystr2,it was still a cheap buy honestly
22-07-2019T21:59:38,SpazztasticKiwi,why don‚Äôt y‚Äôall just make a chart
22-07-2019T22:00:03,Dadrobit,:( And now I head into work so that I might earn the fat stacks of my dreams.
22-07-2019T22:00:14,Bgrmystr2,"the internet already did that, but charts aren't capable of identifying every specific use-case"
22-07-2019T22:00:23,Bgrmystr2,which is usually the problem
22-07-2019T22:00:29,SpazztasticKiwi,that‚Äôs why I say y‚Äôall make the chart
22-07-2019T22:00:35,AspiringNoodle,"Well, once I finish checking out how much NVENC has improved, I can say whether or not Nvidia's GPU's can effectively bump up a streaming rig"
22-07-2019T22:00:50,Bgrmystr2,well at that point there's no need for the chart cuz it's all capable of being done in our head lol
22-07-2019T22:00:53,SpazztasticKiwi,fill it with your own and there‚Äôs your trading card
22-07-2019T22:02:02,Bgrmystr2,There's plenty of other GPU encoders aren't there?
22-07-2019T22:02:09,SpazztasticKiwi,oh and Atlanta has a comicon
22-07-2019T22:02:14,Bgrmystr2,Why is that one the only one that matters?
22-07-2019T22:02:16,SpazztasticKiwi,As I learned from my cousin
22-07-2019T22:02:25,Bgrmystr2,well yeah kiwi
22-07-2019T22:02:34,AspiringNoodle,It matters because only Nvidia offers hardware on the GPU specifically for video encoding
22-07-2019T22:02:51,SpazztasticKiwi,and south carolina
22-07-2019T22:02:52,AspiringNoodle,"Compared to x264 encoding, the performance impact is minimal"
22-07-2019T22:03:48,AspiringNoodle,"That said, I'm checking the performance right now because the original NVENC encoders were even worse than the x264 very fast preset.  But they improve every generation"
22-07-2019T22:04:14,Bgrmystr2,"For editing video, it doesn't really matter what you use honestly"
22-07-2019T22:04:28,AspiringNoodle,NVENC is aimed more at streaming
22-07-2019T22:04:55,AspiringNoodle,It can potentially reduce the need for a stupidly expensive processor or a separate computer altogether
22-07-2019T22:08:17,Bgrmystr2,"AMD has VCE though, which is an alternative to NVENC"
22-07-2019T22:13:42,Bgrmystr2,"Honestly, it depends on a lot of things. https://venturebeat.com/2018/10/15/nvenc-vs-x264-does-cpu-or-rtx-gpu-encoding-work-best-for-twitch/"
22-07-2019T22:14:23,SpazztasticKiwi,I know I‚Äôve wondered this before but what the hell is wrong with Mark
22-07-2019T22:14:48,SpazztasticKiwi,he wants to make an airline with standing seats that does loop de loops
22-07-2019T22:15:19,AspiringNoodle,I wouldn't trust AMD's encoding
22-07-2019T22:15:52,AspiringNoodle,"Was just watching a video where the guy used a Vega 64, and unless he capped the framerate so GPU utilization was around 60%, he was dropping 99% of frames"
22-07-2019T22:16:27,Bgrmystr2,Sounds like he fucked something else
22-07-2019T22:16:29,AspiringNoodle,"That said, Nvidia isn't much better.  While it won't drop frames, at all, the video quality is still horrible."
22-07-2019T22:16:59,Bgrmystr2,I bet you anything he dropped 99% of his frames due to a shitty setting somewhere that he missed
22-07-2019T22:17:02,AspiringNoodle,"I know you want AMD to be a good buy, but video encoding for streaming isn't their forte"
22-07-2019T22:17:17,Bgrmystr2,rather than AMD's encoder
22-07-2019T22:17:21,AspiringNoodle,"It's not Nvidia's either, no matter how much they want it to be :ptv-snicker:"
22-07-2019T22:17:25,Bgrmystr2,"I don't actually care, bro"
22-07-2019T22:17:43,Bgrmystr2,I'm just sayin something like that is obviously not something that can be taken at face value
22-07-2019T22:18:20,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, I use NVENC on an Nvidia card, and I know it works"
22-07-2019T22:18:31,AspiringNoodle,The point I'm making is that AMD doesn't tend to have specialized processing cores
22-07-2019T22:18:31,SpazztasticKiwi,you‚Äôre not saying you‚Äôre suspicious are you
22-07-2019T22:18:40,SpazztasticKiwi,don‚Äôt you know it‚Äôs a no no to lie
22-07-2019T22:18:50,SpazztasticKiwi,surely they wouldn‚Äôt lie
22-07-2019T22:19:06,AspiringNoodle,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pLXrvNOXG4
22-07-2019T22:19:50,AspiringNoodle,Hardware Unboxed was using an 8700k @ 4.9Ghz.  NVENC / x264 very fast didn't drop frames.  Fast dropped ~8% of frames and it only got worse from there.
22-07-2019T22:19:56,Bgrmystr2,"Surely I'm not suspicious. If I was suspicious, I'd be telling people to blindly believe something without bothering to ask questions about it."
22-07-2019T22:20:17,AspiringNoodle,Vega 64 required the fps cap to limit utilization to prevent frame drops
22-07-2019T22:20:18,Bgrmystr2,The moment you're not allowed to ask questions is the moment the corruption has already started.
22-07-2019T22:21:38,SpazztasticKiwi,the most dangerous phase in this language we‚Äôve always done it this way
22-07-2019T22:22:09,SpazztasticKiwi,PhillyD has a little something where he likes to hammer ‚Äúresearch for yourself‚Äù
22-07-2019T22:22:50,SpazztasticKiwi,also tradition is peer pressure from dead people
22-07-2019T22:23:23,SpazztasticKiwi,as little any of that relates to this - back to my own knit
22-07-2019T22:30:09,AspiringNoodle,"So NVENC is an option, but it's limited in use"
22-07-2019T22:32:48,AspiringNoodle,"So, that aside, the only thing really going for Nvidia are the RT and tensor cores"
22-07-2019T22:33:05,AspiringNoodle,AMD is going to have anti-lag and image sharpening features on their end.
22-07-2019T22:33:46,AspiringNoodle,"Anti-lag will be a bit of a mixed bag, because it will give a performance increase in some situation, and potentially worse in others, but I've only seen good things about image sharpening."
22-07-2019T22:34:15,AspiringNoodle,"But before you write off raytracing entirely, Nvidia implemented DLSS to offset the cost of turning on raytracing."
22-07-2019T22:36:41,SpazztasticKiwi,üõå
22-07-2019T22:38:47,AspiringNoodle,"I'm right there with you, lol"
22-07-2019T22:38:58,AspiringNoodle,I went to bed late waiting to see when the super cards would launch
22-07-2019T22:39:07,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-sleepy:
