29-01-2019T00:01:05,Bgrmystr2,So I'd like to do quick things first before having to hard reset it.
29-01-2019T00:01:56,Ordithus,That sounds fun :ptv-nope:

29-01-2019T00:03:20,Bgrmystr2,Welp. I'm out for a bit
29-01-2019T00:03:25,Bgrmystr2,cuz clearly this isn't working
29-01-2019T00:03:36,Ordithus,Ciao
29-01-2019T00:03:39,Bgrmystr2,be back whenever it stops being a crap.

29-01-2019T00:14:23,SpazztasticKiwi,I wonder if I‚Äôll get the 7 or XR with the upgrade
29-01-2019T00:14:45,SpazztasticKiwi,They both seem to be slight overkill but I‚Äôd love the new camera
29-01-2019T00:15:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Not about the can‚Äôt charge and use headphones at the same time thing
29-01-2019T00:16:21,RimaDraws,i love the XR. its no more home button thank god
29-01-2019T00:17:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Does it not come in rose gold
29-01-2019T00:18:32,RimaDraws,it comes in yellow red blue black silver and coral
29-01-2019T00:18:43,RimaDraws,i got red since they didnt have blue
29-01-2019T00:21:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Not a fan if there‚Äôs no rose gold
29-01-2019T00:21:55,SpazztasticKiwi,May end up with a 7 though anyway - it‚Äôs technically the upgrade
29-01-2019T00:27:15,SpazztasticKiwi,My hairs so mega puff it‚Äôs stupid

29-01-2019T12:34:19,TerraTheWizard,"you been to the tank museum, quill?"
29-01-2019T12:34:26,CrimsonQuill,A few.
29-01-2019T12:34:34,CrimsonQuill,Musee de Blindes in France...
29-01-2019T12:34:47,TerraTheWizard,gone on the track carrier thing around the battle course?
29-01-2019T12:34:53,CrimsonQuill,No.
29-01-2019T12:35:11,TerraTheWizard,"oh, the tank museum in england somewhere has a battle course thing"
29-01-2019T12:35:13,CrimsonQuill,But my eldest sister stood in front of the barrel of the 88mm cannon on a King Tiger.
29-01-2019T12:35:21,Azumachan,Nope.
29-01-2019T12:35:26,TerraTheWizard,they do a mock battle then you can ride the personnel carrier
29-01-2019T12:35:31,CrimsonQuill,I have been to the museum in Yeoivil for the fleet Air Arm.
29-01-2019T12:35:44,CrimsonQuill,"I wish I could go to that tank museum though, but I can't"
29-01-2019T12:35:49,CrimsonQuill,Too much to do...

29-01-2019T12:35:53,CrimsonQuill,*sigh*
29-01-2019T12:36:03,TerraTheWizard,also the raf museum in duxford

29-01-2019T12:36:35,TerraTheWizard,speaking of airshows
29-01-2019T12:36:39,CrimsonQuill,Yes?
29-01-2019T12:36:54,TerraTheWizard,i got to see the vulcan twice

29-01-2019T12:37:06,CrimsonQuill,I WOULD LOVE TO SEE ONE.
29-01-2019T12:37:11,TerraTheWizard,in swansea & bournmouth
29-01-2019T12:37:12,CrimsonQuill,A VULCAN.
29-01-2019T12:37:23,TerraTheWizard,sadly it's not doing shows any more
29-01-2019T12:37:48,CrimsonQuill,"I think the aeroplane I want to see most, though, while flying, is the Hawker Siddely Sea Harrier."
29-01-2019T12:37:55,CrimsonQuill,Better known as the Jump Jet.
29-01-2019T12:38:10,TerraTheWizard,"the fun thing was, they said ""they won't be doing any crazy manouvers this time"""
29-01-2019T12:38:18,CrimsonQuill,Like VIFF?
29-01-2019T12:38:19,TerraTheWizard,then they did a roll
29-01-2019T12:38:27,CrimsonQuill,"Hah, to be expectedd!"
29-01-2019T12:38:33,CrimsonQuill,Crazy is relative.
29-01-2019T12:38:58,TerraTheWizard,"well, they told us it would only be level flight because it's not really meant to do anything like that"
29-01-2019T12:39:16,TerraTheWizard,"then they just went ""lol, this is a bomber built like a fighter ROLL TIME"""
29-01-2019T12:39:17,CrimsonQuill,Which aircraft was doing a roll again?
29-01-2019T12:39:25,TerraTheWizard,vulcan
29-01-2019T12:39:34,CrimsonQuill,A VULCAN DOING A BARREL ROLL IS SONETHING I MUST SEE.
29-01-2019T12:39:42,CrimsonQuill,And perhaps the famed Red Arrows...
29-01-2019T12:39:47,TerraTheWizard,i had a video of it but i think it was on my old phone

29-01-2019T13:23:00,Twokinds,One of the sinks in my house broke.
29-01-2019T13:23:06,Twokinds,"Well, the sink handle broke off."
29-01-2019T13:23:24,Twokinds,So... I don't know how to fix this.
29-01-2019T13:23:46,TerraTheWizard,oh dear
29-01-2019T13:25:30,BadFoMo,Duck Tape.
29-01-2019T13:25:53,Twokinds,I'd like to think I'm fairly handy but it's just broken. It turns all the way around and the water doesn't come out.
29-01-2019T13:26:13,Twokinds,I don't know enough about sinks to know how to fix it.
29-01-2019T13:26:22,BadFoMo,Maybe the pipe is frozen.
29-01-2019T13:26:38,Twokinds,"No, it's definitely broken."
29-01-2019T13:27:29,BadFoMo,"Sorry, that's all I had."
29-01-2019T13:27:46,iliar,"Maybe I don't quite understand what exactly happened. But, just buy new! Replace sink handle is not to hard."
29-01-2019T13:30:11,Twokinds,"Unfortunately, the sink is old, and I don't think it'll be possible to find a matching replacement."
29-01-2019T13:30:21,Twokinds,It's one of those two-sink setups.
29-01-2019T13:30:35,Twokinds,So having two different sinks next to each other might not... look very good.
29-01-2019T13:31:27,Twokinds,"I guess we could hire someone to install two new ones. But jeez, I wish I didn't have to."
29-01-2019T13:40:50,Twokinds,It's amazing how things just break down in a house. I feel like a Sim.
29-01-2019T13:41:22,TerraTheWizard,lol
29-01-2019T13:43:12,TerraTheWizard,we had our toilet flush break a few months back
29-01-2019T13:43:44,TerraTheWizard,they only sell the part that broke online now because hardly any toilets have a handle flush these days
29-01-2019T13:43:51,Twokinds,Ah that sucks. I've had to fix that before.
29-01-2019T13:44:04,Twokinds,It's actually not too difficult usually.
29-01-2019T13:44:30,TerraTheWizard,"found the same part, the company had changed names"
29-01-2019T13:44:40,TerraTheWizard,"tried to fit it, was 2mm too big"
29-01-2019T13:44:52,TerraTheWizard,and the joint was too narrow
29-01-2019T13:45:23,TerraTheWizard,but luckily it was a modular part so we just took the new bits & put them on the old one
29-01-2019T13:45:34,TerraTheWizard,works as good as new
29-01-2019T13:45:47,TerraTheWizard,"hopefully for another 30 years, lol"

29-01-2019T17:07:37,ThingsAreMoving,"Also tap handles are usually universal, go to a hardware sore, buy two, replace both, and enjoy your fresh looking sink"
29-01-2019T18:08:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Just make sure to turn off the water before opening the pipe to replace the thing
29-01-2019T18:09:37,TerraTheWizard,lol
29-01-2019T18:10:40,ThingsAreMoving,Yup. Close the main water valve and drain the pipes by running the remaining water out before you attempt to repair those handles
