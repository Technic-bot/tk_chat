16-07-2019T11:04:31,Orthonox,Our lioncloth wearing boy is looking sharp as a tact.

16-07-2019T11:10:22,AspiringNoodle,dapper wolf is dapper
16-07-2019T11:12:33,Orthonox,Indeed. I wonder if he will ever see a change in clothes in the comic.
16-07-2019T12:00:37,AspiringNoodle,Applied for job last night a few hours before bed
16-07-2019T12:00:42,AspiringNoodle,Got a call this morning about the application
16-07-2019T12:00:50,AspiringNoodle,Damn they work fast D:
16-07-2019T12:01:23,AspiringNoodle,That said... oof.  The only real openings they had were for evening / third shift (10p.m. - 6a.m.)
16-07-2019T12:01:49,AspiringNoodle,At least the nice lady on the phone said she'd forward my application to other nearby turkey hills and see if they have openings :D
16-07-2019T12:11:10,TeapotOfDoom,Hoi
16-07-2019T12:11:29,TeapotOfDoom,Always third shift is big oof
16-07-2019T12:12:49,AspiringNoodle,"She told me, and I quote, ""I can't guarantee first or second shift"""
16-07-2019T12:13:07,AspiringNoodle,"Which is a shame, because the application only mentioned needing to be available for occassional holidays / weekends"
16-07-2019T12:13:46,AspiringNoodle,"There was a 2nd application that mentioned evening shifts, but I didn't apply for that :/"
16-07-2019T12:14:04,AspiringNoodle,*me 2 weeks later*
16-07-2019T12:14:15,AspiringNoodle,"I'LL TAKE THE SHIFT, PLZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ. I NEED MONEH ;_;"
16-07-2019T13:09:34,AspiringNoodle,Corsair specifically uses the Phison PS5016-E16
16-07-2019T13:09:45,AspiringNoodle,"Aw man, and I was doing so good the past week"
16-07-2019T13:11:49,TeapotOfDoom,Haha
16-07-2019T13:11:56,TeapotOfDoom,Well who cares
16-07-2019T13:12:15,TeapotOfDoom,Yes i just wanted to mentioned that. Both do as far as i know
16-07-2019T13:12:28,TeapotOfDoom,Seems to be a reference design
16-07-2019T13:13:12,TeapotOfDoom,"Phison markets it as an ssd, not as a single controller"
16-07-2019T13:14:04,AspiringNoodle,"ooooo, apparently the 3900x is back in stock on newegg"
16-07-2019T13:14:08,AspiringNoodle,Let's see how long that lasts xD
16-07-2019T13:15:30,TeapotOfDoom,Ho Le Fuk the controller has 8 channels
16-07-2019T13:15:44,Orthonox,"Do you plan on buying it anytime soon, @AspiringNoodle?"
16-07-2019T13:16:54,AspiringNoodle,I want to build the system ASAP
16-07-2019T13:17:16,AspiringNoodle,I want to test whether or not my GPU is working or not.  And what better way than using a new system? :P
16-07-2019T13:17:50,TeapotOfDoom,And there was i wondering why the best i could get with dual channel was 120MB seq. Still at the same level the controller would have ten times the performance
16-07-2019T13:18:27,TeapotOfDoom,Why are these things so hard to get your hands on...
16-07-2019T13:21:36,AspiringNoodle,"Haha, I was right, the 3900x was a fluke xD"
16-07-2019T13:21:43,AspiringNoodle,Just checked my cart and it was goneso
16-07-2019T13:22:04,TeapotOfDoom,You have to be faster
16-07-2019T13:22:21,TeapotOfDoom,That stuff's selling like hot cakes
16-07-2019T13:29:21,Orthonox,"If you have the money to buy the CPU, then what are you waiting for?"
16-07-2019T13:29:25,AspiringNoodle,"Maybe in the future AMD will produce double on launch, lol"
16-07-2019T13:29:32,AspiringNoodle,I plan to order everything at once
16-07-2019T13:36:54,Orthonox,What is the purpose of the new system? Gaming? Rendering? Video editing? Simulating the Matrix?
16-07-2019T13:38:11,TeapotOfDoom,Definitely matrix
16-07-2019T13:39:09,TeapotOfDoom,You've never done high perf comp until you did the matrix benchmark
16-07-2019T13:42:23,Orthonox,A Benchmark to surpass Cinebench and FurMark.
16-07-2019T13:45:47,Orthonox,I would not mind upgrading my PC but I do not play enough new games nor have gotten deep into 3D modeling to warrant that decision.
16-07-2019T13:50:00,AspiringNoodle,"My system refuses to recognize any gpus (that I own, at least), and my current gpu can't even handle Apex Legends at 1440p ;)"
16-07-2019T13:50:05,AspiringNoodle,So I don't have much of a choice
16-07-2019T13:50:42,Orthonox,What GPUs do you own and use?
16-07-2019T13:51:02,AspiringNoodle,I have a gtx 560 and a gtx 970
16-07-2019T13:51:16,AspiringNoodle,"The 560 worked the last time I plugged it in, but didn't work this time"
16-07-2019T13:51:25,TeapotOfDoom,Mmm chicken wings
16-07-2019T13:51:40,TeapotOfDoom,I still say bad slot
16-07-2019T13:51:50,AspiringNoodle,"I can confirm at the very least HDMI on my monitor works, since I plugged in an HDMI cable from my xbox 360 to my motherboard's slot :P"
16-07-2019T13:51:58,AspiringNoodle,But HDMI didn't get shit from my 970
16-07-2019T13:52:28,Orthonox,The PC you are using can only recognize the GTX 970?
16-07-2019T13:52:31,AspiringNoodle,And the 560 had to hook up to a monitor that used an entirely different connection
16-07-2019T13:53:03,AspiringNoodle,I more or less ran every different combination possible and couldn't get either of my gpus to output an image to a monitor
16-07-2019T13:54:05,AspiringNoodle,"While I get an image from iGPU, I don't think the GPUs are inherently at fault.  It'd be pretty weird for a card that's been sitting in a box for a few years to suddenly stop working"
16-07-2019T13:54:24,AspiringNoodle,So the problem is either the motherboard or the power supply
16-07-2019T13:54:36,Orthonox,So you are using the iGPU to output an image?
16-07-2019T13:54:45,AspiringNoodle,Yup.
16-07-2019T13:54:54,AspiringNoodle,"Glorious 1080p on a 1440p monitor, lol"
16-07-2019T13:56:55,Orthonox,"For an iGPU, that's not bad but you were used to 1440p so this is clearly a visible downgrade."
16-07-2019T13:57:30,AspiringNoodle,It's pretty bad because that's the maximum supported resolution
16-07-2019T13:57:47,AspiringNoodle,We're talking about an igpu on a $220 processor from late 2012
16-07-2019T13:59:04,AspiringNoodle,"In order to play Overwatch (honestly surprised it can!) I have to set all graphical settings to lowest, set resolution to 720p, and then set resolution scale to 50%"
16-07-2019T13:59:15,AspiringNoodle,So I'm the exclusive member of the 360p60 club :D
16-07-2019T14:00:14,AspiringNoodle,1 pixel in Overwatch is now made up of 16 1440p pixels <3
16-07-2019T14:14:21,TeapotOfDoom,Now that's a high quality pixel
16-07-2019T14:14:46,AspiringNoodle,Only the best for this computer
16-07-2019T14:14:53,TeapotOfDoom,I just learned that cloudflare uses lava lamps as their randomness generators
16-07-2019T14:15:09,TeapotOfDoom,Wtf cloudflare xD
16-07-2019T14:15:09,AspiringNoodle,Never has such a resolution revolution been seen since the days of Quake
16-07-2019T14:15:17,TeapotOfDoom,Lol
16-07-2019T14:15:28,AspiringNoodle,"Tbf, trying to randomly generate numbers on a computer is a friggin' nightmare"
16-07-2019T14:15:30,TeapotOfDoom,Ray traced quake?
16-07-2019T14:15:37,AspiringNoodle,Original Quake :D
16-07-2019T14:15:48,TeapotOfDoom,But rtx is off
16-07-2019T14:16:04,TeapotOfDoom,You need da rtx
16-07-2019T14:16:09,AspiringNoodle,"The problem with RNG on computers is that the ""random"" numbers always start with a seed value"
16-07-2019T14:16:28,TeapotOfDoom,Yes. Everything is sudo random
16-07-2019T14:16:31,AspiringNoodle,"And once you give the system a seed, it will generate the exact same string of ""random"" numbers. Every. Single. Time."
16-07-2019T14:16:50,AspiringNoodle,That's why companies are turning to external input to generate numbers
16-07-2019T14:17:02,AspiringNoodle,Some use atmospheric noise
16-07-2019T14:17:07,TeapotOfDoom,Still i think using lava lamps for all things can only be the work of cloudflare
16-07-2019T14:17:32,TeapotOfDoom,These guys are really weird. In a good way
16-07-2019T14:18:12,TeapotOfDoom,They're the only internet giant who managed to not get bad press in the last few years
16-07-2019T14:28:08,AspiringNoodle,I'd argue Steam fits the bill :P
16-07-2019T14:28:27,AspiringNoodle,Steam is playing 4D chess against EGS... by doing nothing. lmao
16-07-2019T14:37:51,TeapotOfDoom,Kinda
16-07-2019T14:38:15,TeapotOfDoom,Also they caught some shade for their high quodes on game sales
16-07-2019T14:38:40,TeapotOfDoom,But yeah considering they're pushing linux support hard
16-07-2019T14:39:07,AspiringNoodle,"Every time my will falters and I consider buying a 9900k, I remember"
16-07-2019T14:39:12,AspiringNoodle,SECURITY BREACH
16-07-2019T14:39:15,AspiringNoodle,SECURITY BREACH
16-07-2019T14:39:20,AspiringNoodle,*ALARMS SOUNDED*
16-07-2019T14:39:33,AspiringNoodle,The list. Is. LOOOOOOOOOOOONG.
16-07-2019T14:41:17,AspiringNoodle,AMD was only affected by two discovered breaches
16-07-2019T14:41:39,AspiringNoodle,"Specter and Specter v4.  And even though those got patched out, iirc you need physical access to the machine to utilize them, anyways"
16-07-2019T14:46:23,SpazztasticKiwi,one of these days Mark’s gonna summon some bloodhounds with that mental breakdown call he’s got
16-07-2019T14:50:57,AspiringNoodle,I love watching Mark play rage games
16-07-2019T14:51:11,AspiringNoodle,"He's either a really good actor, or is legitimately suffering"
16-07-2019T14:51:20,AspiringNoodle,"Either way, I am entertained :ptv-snicker:"
16-07-2019T14:53:00,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve got a good feeling he’s not acting. and it’s not he’s necessarily mad - he’s aggravated
16-07-2019T14:53:35,SpazztasticKiwi,something that exists to not work or agitate shouldn’t exist
16-07-2019T14:54:24,SpazztasticKiwi,"rage games are just that and while I don’t play them cause I know how stupid it is, he plays them knowing the same and it raises his blood pressure"
16-07-2019T14:56:10,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s theorized playing games like that or just in general hyping your aggression level raises testosterone
16-07-2019T14:56:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m pretty sure what they mean is “adrenaline”
16-07-2019T15:10:15,AspiringNoodle,"I find it funny, because I wonder how long it takes him to get to the point"
16-07-2019T15:10:30,AspiringNoodle,"For me, it's taken upwards of 5 - 6 hours to reach the tipping point"
16-07-2019T15:12:39,TeapotOfDoom,Why did my picarto just change to german
16-07-2019T15:12:45,TeapotOfDoom,i'm concerned
16-07-2019T15:13:24,TeapotOfDoom,"also yay rage games. I would not play them for the life of me, i would just get bored after the third or fith try"
16-07-2019T15:13:38,TeapotOfDoom,but watching a ragegame vid is funny
16-07-2019T15:13:49,AspiringNoodle,I have Getting Over It on my steam account <3
16-07-2019T15:14:00,TeapotOfDoom,ever tried it?
16-07-2019T15:14:09,TeapotOfDoom,or god forbid beat it?
16-07-2019T15:14:29,AspiringNoodle,"Not yet.  Even before my computer threw a tantrum, I have storage issues"
16-07-2019T15:14:39,AspiringNoodle,I was a dummy and only ever built this computer with an SSD :P
16-07-2019T15:15:07,AspiringNoodle,"Nowadays, it's not too bad, with 2TB SSDs being available for $367 - $450"
16-07-2019T15:15:23,AspiringNoodle,But we're talking back in the days where it was $1 per GB.  And I only got a 256
16-07-2019T15:24:53,TeapotOfDoom,wowowow you tellin me the only storage your system has is a 256GB ssd?
16-07-2019T15:55:35,Orthonox,I cannot understand the rationale behind that.
16-07-2019T16:02:30,TeapotOfDoom,i find it respectable especially if you also use it for games
16-07-2019T16:02:43,TeapotOfDoom,i tend to fill up my drives pretty quitck
16-07-2019T16:07:56,Bgrmystr2,"SSD is way faster than HDD and some people don't store lots of data, Orthonox"
16-07-2019T16:08:14,Bgrmystr2,tis the primary reason
16-07-2019T16:27:49,SpazztasticKiwi,saw a dude at Walmart today with those fancy patterned shorts on. I found myself nearly staring cause I legit thought he was just wearing boxers in public
16-07-2019T16:28:50,IronHorseComics,plot twist! he was
16-07-2019T16:29:25,SpazztasticKiwi,the new sag trend
16-07-2019T16:29:33,SpazztasticKiwi,just leave the pants at home
16-07-2019T16:30:40,IronHorseComics,I would but I don't think women would appreciate my fat thighs
16-07-2019T16:31:30,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
16-07-2019T16:34:26,TeapotOfDoom,:ctwokinds-keith8D:
16-07-2019T16:34:56,TeapotOfDoom,who says i ever wore pants?
16-07-2019T16:43:14,AspiringNoodle,Yes. Yes I am
16-07-2019T16:43:25,AspiringNoodle,*processing...*
16-07-2019T16:43:28,AspiringNoodle,*processing...*
16-07-2019T16:43:32,AspiringNoodle,Wut
16-07-2019T16:44:15,AspiringNoodle,Picarto only updated after I sent my message
16-07-2019T16:44:26,AspiringNoodle,"But yes Teapot, I only have the 1 ssd :P"
16-07-2019T16:44:35,AspiringNoodle,And it worked for a long while!
16-07-2019T16:45:25,AspiringNoodle,"I spent most of my PC gaming career playing WoW.  I dabbled in Rainbow Six Siege, World of Tanks, Hearthstone, Heroes of the Storm, and Overwatch.  But I rarely had more than 2 of those installed at the same time."
16-07-2019T16:45:44,AspiringNoodle,"But now that I'm moving over to PC gaming, it's filling up quickly."
16-07-2019T16:48:34,AspiringNoodle,"I'm thinking of getting a 2TB SSD, but I think even a 1TB might be a bit more than I need."
16-07-2019T16:58:09,TeapotOfDoom,i got a 2tb nvme a while ago
16-07-2019T16:58:53,TeapotOfDoom,they are really cheap now tbh. i found an intel one that was just 230€. i mean for an 950 equivalent with 2tb
16-07-2019T17:00:13,TeapotOfDoom,i dont know how people survive with capacities so low. i mean you can ask the same question how i manage to fill mine up so quick
16-07-2019T17:00:42,AspiringNoodle,"Tbf, the intel one's garbage ;)"
16-07-2019T17:00:56,AspiringNoodle,It uses QLC and suffers durability as a result
16-07-2019T17:00:57,TeapotOfDoom,i use it just for mass storage
16-07-2019T17:01:08,TeapotOfDoom,you mean tlc
16-07-2019T17:01:33,TeapotOfDoom,still mass storage. i dont access it that often for it to matter
16-07-2019T17:02:05,TeapotOfDoom,and i would prefer a cheapo ssd as mass storage compared to a magnetic mass storage
16-07-2019T17:08:27,AspiringNoodle,"Teapot, check and make sure"
16-07-2019T17:08:32,AspiringNoodle,Was it something like intel 600p?
16-07-2019T17:08:43,AspiringNoodle,660p*
16-07-2019T17:17:57,TeapotOfDoom,yes why
16-07-2019T17:18:29,AspiringNoodle,That's QLC
16-07-2019T17:18:38,TeapotOfDoom,really now?
16-07-2019T17:18:43,AspiringNoodle,https://www.newegg.com/intel-660p-series-2tb/p/N82E16820167461
16-07-2019T17:18:49,TeapotOfDoom,now that would be even better
16-07-2019T17:18:50,AspiringNoodle,That's gonna suffer major write durability
16-07-2019T17:19:03,TeapotOfDoom,oh
16-07-2019T17:19:10,TeapotOfDoom,i mixed it up with mlc
16-07-2019T17:19:23,AspiringNoodle,"As long as you aren't gonna keep writing and overwriting, you'll be fine"
16-07-2019T17:19:38,TeapotOfDoom,yeah i'm pretty sure
16-07-2019T17:20:13,TeapotOfDoom,i mostly use it for bigger vm images also one half of the thing is on standby as i didn't see the need to format it yet
16-07-2019T17:20:27,TeapotOfDoom,so i'll be fine
16-07-2019T17:20:52,TeapotOfDoom,i spent the last two hours mixing hardstyle. i'm tired
16-07-2019T17:21:15,AspiringNoodle,Here's why I don't recommend QLC for a main drive
16-07-2019T17:21:44,AspiringNoodle,660p 1/2TB TBW durability: 200TB / 400TB
16-07-2019T17:21:47,TeapotOfDoom,i hate the stretch algorithms of fl. they mess up everything so bad you cannot repitch anything except a break maybe
16-07-2019T17:22:02,TeapotOfDoom,only 400?
16-07-2019T17:22:11,AspiringNoodle,970 Evo PLUS 1/2TB: 600TB / 1200TB
16-07-2019T17:22:42,TeapotOfDoom,"well if the drive breaks, ill notice ^^ i hope there's enough spare on there"
16-07-2019T17:22:51,AspiringNoodle,I need to double check
16-07-2019T17:23:00,TeapotOfDoom,I'll make sure there's backups of the important stuff
16-07-2019T17:23:09,AspiringNoodle,There are outlets that tested write durability for ssds
16-07-2019T17:23:21,AspiringNoodle,And one manufacturer's SSD killed itself the moment any storage became unusable
16-07-2019T17:23:24,TeapotOfDoom,but 200 write cycles seems a bit low
16-07-2019T17:23:30,AspiringNoodle,That's not cycles
16-07-2019T17:23:33,AspiringNoodle,That's 200 terabytes
16-07-2019T17:23:50,AspiringNoodle,"And if you have the 2TB, that goes up to 400"
16-07-2019T17:23:58,AspiringNoodle,But that's 1/3 the durability of TLC memory
16-07-2019T17:24:14,TeapotOfDoom,that's just garbage tbh
16-07-2019T17:24:26,TeapotOfDoom,what do i even have this drive for then
16-07-2019T17:24:48,TeapotOfDoom,"well now i got it, ill make backups good to know"
16-07-2019T17:24:50,AspiringNoodle,It's cheap and useful for mass storage where you don't delete stuff often :p
16-07-2019T17:25:03,AspiringNoodle,"Also, because it's a PCIe drive, you can pull things up stupid quick"
16-07-2019T17:25:25,AspiringNoodle,"But yeah, it's definitely not for power users or professionals who might be moving data all over the place"
16-07-2019T17:25:35,TeapotOfDoom,*deletes 80gig vm images regularly* :ctwokinds-keithdotdotdot:
16-07-2019T17:25:52,AspiringNoodle,It's more for casual users / normies who'll enjoy the improved performance and tends to hoard everything they add
16-07-2019T17:26:32,AspiringNoodle,"Also, who won't get near full capacity often ^^;"
16-07-2019T17:26:41,TeapotOfDoom,well if the drive decides to fail i'll get a better one

16-07-2019T20:34:37,AspiringNoodle,"Don't get me started on Intel naming, but it's the version withou the iGPU, which is supposed to help with overclocking"
