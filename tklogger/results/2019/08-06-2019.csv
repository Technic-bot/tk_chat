08-06-2019T00:27:59,SpazztasticKiwi,my mind wasn’t anywhere near money
08-06-2019T00:42:19,AspiringNoodle,Love reading about justice <3
08-06-2019T00:43:14,AspiringNoodle,"That said, no justice for Kat.  Ever :("
08-06-2019T02:07:30,SpazztasticKiwi,maybe we’ll see something nice for her later. Like another hopeless dreamer with a slightly unhealthy friendship with the 1920s
08-06-2019T02:07:57,SpazztasticKiwi,A Gatsby guy - it’s time to dress sexy again
08-06-2019T02:29:56,SpazztasticKiwi,🛌
08-06-2019T02:52:29,FloofyCat,Some of these suggestions are so good that I hope mine doesn't win so I can see those sketched
08-06-2019T02:53:38,FloofyCat,And some I've seen suggested for so long I'm gunna vote for them so the poor soul can finally get a turn
08-06-2019T02:55:39,FloofyCat,And some are pretty darned wholesome which fudge yes.

08-06-2019T04:00:08,iliar,Whoops. Something went wrong.
08-06-2019T04:00:37,SpazztasticKiwi,or “today” it seems. I want a nap after running but i try to aim for bed so I’m not messing anything up
08-06-2019T04:01:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Yet I’m still managing to stay up at night - I figure it’s can’t get comfortable thing. And I’m easily distracted
08-06-2019T04:02:47,iliar,Now everything works.
08-06-2019T04:03:00,Twokinds,My bad
08-06-2019T04:03:08,Twokinds,Forgot to upload the actual comic page

08-06-2019T04:03:53,Bgrmystr2,I was wondering when you were gonna upload it lol
08-06-2019T04:04:01,Twokinds,Yeah sorry
08-06-2019T04:04:13,Twokinds,"Man, I struggled hard with the text."
08-06-2019T04:04:20,Twokinds,Things will go smoother.
08-06-2019T04:05:04,iliar,It seems to me at Tom have challenge: put as much text on page as possible.
08-06-2019T04:07:11,Twokinds,Yeah I know it's too much
08-06-2019T04:07:30,SpazztasticKiwi,justcramit
08-06-2019T04:07:40,SpazztasticKiwi,what could possibly go wrong
08-06-2019T04:08:14,iliar,I do not want to say that it is bad. It is just noticeable that recently there has been more text.
08-06-2019T04:09:12,Twokinds,I need to stop overexplaining things XD
08-06-2019T04:11:18,SpazztasticKiwi,“I have no idea what I’m doing and you can’t stop me”
08-06-2019T04:16:06,SpazztasticKiwi,my contacts are out so I’m gonna hang up the solo dance party

08-06-2019T04:35:27,TerraTheWizard,some... interesting ones
08-06-2019T09:23:36,FloofyCat,"Tbh Tom you could just doodle someone in five seconds in the last frame, then put a speech bubble and put an A4 sheet worth of text in there and I'll still be happy."
08-06-2019T09:25:10,FloofyCat,Just an A4 sheet of two characters having a normal conversation

08-06-2019T11:51:35,AspiringNoodle,"And even then, you may still need one for some reason."
08-06-2019T11:52:45,AspiringNoodle,"Just so long as your comic doesn't turn into a novel, s'all good :ptv-laugh:"
08-06-2019T11:59:27,RimaDraws,whats wrong with that
08-06-2019T12:00:03,AspiringNoodle,"Just imagine it:  Soon, text starts taking up more and more of the page."
08-06-2019T12:00:23,AspiringNoodle,Then the characters start shrinking to fit the larger text boxes
08-06-2019T12:00:26,RimaDraws,so what. novels are good. if i couldnt have my comic i would have made it one
08-06-2019T12:02:08,AspiringNoodle,I have literally no response

08-06-2019T12:13:02,RimaDraws,okay
08-06-2019T12:13:24,AspiringNoodle,"Dang, thought people would get that joke"

08-06-2019T12:28:17,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
08-06-2019T12:28:30,RimaDraws,LOL
08-06-2019T12:29:29,RimaDraws,I need suggestions for my PicartoTV offline picture
08-06-2019T12:29:37,Orthonox,Now we need a sketch of Kat as more feline than dog.
08-06-2019T12:31:38,Orthonox,You could try having a picture of a desk with a sheet of paper and pen/tablet on the tablet waiting to be picked up.
08-06-2019T12:33:36,RimaDraws,Maybe yes
08-06-2019T12:34:14,Orthonox,That was the first idea I thought of when looking at your page. It might be generic.
08-06-2019T12:37:24,RimaDraws,Maybe
08-06-2019T12:37:53,Orthonox,"What are things that you like besides drawing humans, furries, and anime?"
08-06-2019T12:38:07,RimaDraws,Just that
08-06-2019T12:38:51,AspiringNoodle,Rima has star now :ptv-excited:
08-06-2019T12:39:12,Orthonox,Describe your bedroom. It can say a lot about a person.
08-06-2019T12:39:27,RimaDraws,Ugh I don’t draw in my bedroom
08-06-2019T12:39:56,Orthonox,Okay. Your favorite room or ideal room that inspires your creativity.
08-06-2019T12:40:09,Orthonox,Something that speaks to you.
08-06-2019T12:41:08,AspiringNoodle,"Also, I should point out that Kat as a Fox would mean she's now a completely different species.  So she *could* have kids, if it fixed her genes."
08-06-2019T12:41:50,RimaDraws,Well my ideal room to work in would be a desk sitting near the window and my graphics tablet sitting on it with all the wiring for it. My computer desktop next to it. Shelves with art supplies in one corner and another shelf with my books
08-06-2019T12:42:50,Orthonox,Cool that you mentioned window. Do you like to see daylight or nighttime out in the window?
08-06-2019T12:43:03,RimaDraws,Nighttime possibly
08-06-2019T12:43:55,AspiringNoodle,"Corner desk, or really big standard desk?"
08-06-2019T12:44:12,RimaDraws,Something simple
08-06-2019T12:47:19,Orthonox,I say that should be an idea for your offline picture. A cool detail you should add is if the desk is organized or messy as a sign of your personality.
08-06-2019T12:48:15,Orthonox,"Maybe you have a bunch of random supplies lay haphazardly around and tangled wires, or eveything is nice and neat. Something to reflect who you are."
08-06-2019T13:04:39,AspiringNoodle,I can sympathize with messy environments
08-06-2019T13:04:55,AspiringNoodle,Logical me:  It's so much easier when everything is neat and organized
08-06-2019T13:05:06,AspiringNoodle,Primitive me: But it's so much woooooooork
08-06-2019T13:07:17,Dadrobit,Almost forgot to vote. Just got mine in.

08-06-2019T15:15:34,Mippy,Definetly adds to the suspence
08-06-2019T15:15:35,unsteddyphoenix,so you  did them all individually
08-06-2019T15:15:36,Orthonox,I thought this was a program that Amenom made.
08-06-2019T15:15:40,GamerCent,What is that
08-06-2019T15:15:44,SamuelLeumas,All photoshop? I would have thought it was some HTML5 or CSS magic
08-06-2019T15:15:44,FenceEqualizer,There has to be an easier way to animate that :ptv-confused:
08-06-2019T15:15:48,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Teddy, Toms miles ahead of us"
08-06-2019T15:15:49,unsteddyphoenix,youre a lunatic

08-06-2019T16:30:24,EricE549,@hoolibas i read somewhere that the reason why all the florida man stories keep popping up is because florida's police reports are easipy accessible compared to other states
08-06-2019T16:30:26,FoxxTrotter,Only province I've been to in Canada is Ontario.
08-06-2019T16:30:28,IronHorseComics,"I would say Rima, I think the gulf coat is better than the Atlantic coast. Of course I've only been on the Atlantic once..."
08-06-2019T16:30:29,metalman20,so i'm curious how did you all discover twokinds?

08-06-2019T18:29:13,unsteddyphoenix,Not sure we can confidently say that yet
08-06-2019T18:29:15,TraceLegacyXI,"Judging by the triangle. I mean cmon, who else has a triangle on their face?"
08-06-2019T18:29:19,metalman20,wait so i'm confused are we still on sketch number 4 or did i get back right when he was starting on 5

08-06-2019T18:29:32,unsteddyphoenix,Maybe Tom forgot to draw the other triangle
08-06-2019T18:29:41,unsteddyphoenix,thats probably it
08-06-2019T18:29:45,InTheLionsDen,As per the bottom of the screen we are on sketch #4

08-06-2019T18:30:43,Sclimshady,Pocket sand
08-06-2019T18:30:58,Dimensional,Wow. Trace looks good.
08-06-2019T18:31:05,PalmettoPathfinder1,You know I'm a bit curious as to how Natani would look like if she was drawn by Jeso or Kameloh.
08-06-2019T18:31:06,TraceLegacyXI,HA! I KNEW IT!
08-06-2019T18:31:16,NateDogg1232,I never knew Trace had boobs XD
08-06-2019T18:31:28,TraceLegacyXI,... wow
08-06-2019T18:31:29,unsteddyphoenix,"Ah damn, I guess you were right"
08-06-2019T18:31:30,McClaw,"Now I'm wondering if humanized Nora will end up wearing that, too."
08-06-2019T18:31:33,Avolendi,Cursed items abound? Plus Nora
08-06-2019T18:31:40,TraceLegacyXI,You’ve never seen the side art?
08-06-2019T18:31:41,unsteddyphoenix,Its crazy that trace was a girl the whole time
08-06-2019T18:31:52,TraceLegacyXI,Got that right
08-06-2019T18:31:52,unsteddyphoenix,I thought he was a boy

08-06-2019T18:32:15,TraceLegacyXI,Illuminati Confirmed
08-06-2019T18:32:18,unsteddyphoenix,I wondered why he didnt have boobs
08-06-2019T18:32:20,Sclimshady,"No guys, but life.. finds a way"
08-06-2019T18:32:21,unsteddyphoenix,this explains it
08-06-2019T18:32:22,NateDogg1232,All the cast is female with some just having more prominent male characteristics.
08-06-2019T18:32:36,TraceLegacyXI,Flora
08-06-2019T18:32:45,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Flora the cutest boob'd man

08-06-2019T18:33:06,TraceLegacyXI,Even better
08-06-2019T18:33:49,TraceLegacyXI,Now I really wanna see how this turns out.
08-06-2019T18:34:31,NateDogg1232,I'm super curious about how all of these will turn out. I always love wathing these streams
08-06-2019T18:34:37,TraceLegacyXI,Why is the chat so silent all of the sudden?
08-06-2019T18:34:48,TraceLegacyXI,Same natedogg.

08-06-2019T18:35:05,Sclimshady,:violin:
08-06-2019T18:35:06,metalman20,i'm not really sure what to talk about
08-06-2019T18:35:17,TraceLegacyXI,🎶 🎶
08-06-2019T18:35:29,Mippy,The lack of lewd Basitins latly?
08-06-2019T18:35:40,InTheLionsDen,:ctwokinds-nibsdance:
08-06-2019T18:35:40,TraceLegacyXI,🎶
08-06-2019T18:35:44,NateDogg1232,When will it be revealed where Trace's triangle came from?
08-06-2019T18:35:54,Sclimshady,LEWD BASITINS!?:ctwokinds-maddiessparkles:
08-06-2019T18:36:00,InTheLionsDen,What triangle?
08-06-2019T18:36:04,TraceLegacyXI,... I really don’t know
08-06-2019T18:36:08,Maztitos,xD
08-06-2019T18:36:32,Avolendi,Is it really a triangle? Or secretly a diamon shape thats obscured?
08-06-2019T18:36:33,Strongpaw,Trace fell asleep during math class };>
08-06-2019T18:36:44,TraceLegacyXI,Lul

08-06-2019T18:36:53,tony1695,Now we need to see Trace shaved bald
08-06-2019T18:36:53,NateDogg1232,That trig was killing him.
08-06-2019T18:37:00,Sclimshady,It's obviously a star
08-06-2019T18:37:01,TraceLegacyXI,Yepp
08-06-2019T18:37:11,NateDogg1232,Oh man that's weird... Thinking of how he looks bald.
08-06-2019T18:37:16,AspiringNoodle,I wonder how badly Basitins would freak if you shaved one.
08-06-2019T18:37:21,TraceLegacyXI,No it’s a swastica
08-06-2019T18:37:27,SpinoSpiritNinja,Oh

08-06-2019T18:37:47,TraceLegacyXI,Sorry
08-06-2019T18:37:51,TraceLegacyXI,😐
08-06-2019T18:38:01,NateDogg1232,Shaving a basitin is the worst offense of them all. A new level of nudity.
08-06-2019T18:38:02,Avolendi,"Besides being wrong, it's also just horribly inaccurate >.>"
08-06-2019T18:38:04,TraceLegacyXI,It won’t happen again
08-06-2019T18:38:13,TraceLegacyXI,SORRY EVERYONE!
08-06-2019T18:38:24,Avolendi,Was trying to derail the derailement there
08-06-2019T18:38:25,Sclimshady,:ctwokinds-redrose:*[make sure of it]

08-06-2019T18:39:28,TraceLegacyXI,No offense
08-06-2019T18:39:34,TraceLegacyXI,XD

08-06-2019T18:39:47,Avolendi,I've been at it all evening. Just having been getting the biggest responces. So then just keep making worse ones :P
08-06-2019T18:39:55,Avolendi,*haven't
08-06-2019T18:39:56,TraceLegacyXI,Nice
08-06-2019T18:40:04,TraceLegacyXI,That’s something I can be proud of
08-06-2019T18:40:07,Sclimshady,Do those dresses work like overalls? does the front flap up?
08-06-2019T18:40:21,TraceLegacyXI,Idk shady. Idk
08-06-2019T18:40:23,Avolendi,Though I'd also do that if I did get good responces. Actually once I'm on a roll I just make increasingly worse ones
08-06-2019T18:40:24,Mippy,Got some Linguinis
08-06-2019T18:40:33,Sclimshady,Some luigis?

08-06-2019T18:40:46,TraceLegacyXI,Noose?
08-06-2019T18:41:00,Avolendi,No moose on the loose?
08-06-2019T18:41:05,Sclimshady,I haven't worn many dresses in my time so I dont really know these things
08-06-2019T18:41:09,TraceLegacyXI,WHAT AM I SAYING??

08-06-2019T18:41:21,Orthonox,Is this Tracy in Tigress attire?
08-06-2019T18:41:30,TraceLegacyXI,Hm...
08-06-2019T18:41:38,Mippy,It's over cooked
08-06-2019T18:41:43,TraceLegacyXI,Good question orthodox
08-06-2019T18:41:54,TraceLegacyXI,But I don’t think so
08-06-2019T18:41:56,Sclimshady,"No!, poor Luigi"
08-06-2019T18:42:08,Avolendi,Don't think they have the dress element? More on mobility I think?
08-06-2019T18:42:23,NateDogg1232,That's a very disinterested face...
08-06-2019T18:42:33,tony1695,"I'm guessing there's gonna be a third, but who?"
08-06-2019T18:42:36,unsteddyphoenix,*keith
08-06-2019T18:42:38,Orthonox,I did not read the bottom of the stream
08-06-2019T18:42:42,unsteddyphoenix,Its a very keith  face
08-06-2019T18:42:49,TraceLegacyXI,It is
08-06-2019T18:42:53,Avolendi,Think so as well
08-06-2019T18:42:57,TraceLegacyXI,Because it IS Keith face
08-06-2019T18:43:07,Orthonox,No other person owns that face more than Keith.
08-06-2019T18:43:10,TraceLegacyXI,I think
08-06-2019T18:43:13,NateDogg1232,fem keith?

08-06-2019T18:43:40,Avolendi,Hmm. But would femkeith look so bored?
08-06-2019T18:43:42,TraceLegacyXI,Or maybe Kat
08-06-2019T18:43:44,Sclimshady,thats what the suggestion says
08-06-2019T18:43:45,NateDogg1232,The droopy ears makes me think it's keith
08-06-2019T18:44:03,TraceLegacyXI,It doesn’t have ears yet

08-06-2019T18:44:32,unsteddyphoenix,a basitin is a basitin?
08-06-2019T18:44:38,TraceLegacyXI,Yes
08-06-2019T18:44:45,Avolendi,Well since some of the silly sketches had keith and femkeith and she has a different personality in those. Kinda flexible in the sketches?
08-06-2019T18:45:01,TraceLegacyXI,Yea
08-06-2019T18:45:07,TraceLegacyXI,*yes
08-06-2019T18:45:08,Avolendi,"But yeah, eye shadow was added, so femkeith"

08-06-2019T18:46:00,Avolendi,Dark part at the side of the eye.
08-06-2019T18:46:00,TraceLegacyXI,Huh?

08-06-2019T18:48:03,TraceLegacyXI,The name of the stream is “kathrin puts on a fashion show for more outfits.”
08-06-2019T18:48:22,PalmettoPathfinder1,I like the idea of fem Keith wearing Ancient Egyptian clothing.  Although I wonder if it's the outfit that leaves the breasts bare?
08-06-2019T18:48:25,TraceLegacyXI,So this is Kats doing somehowomehow
08-06-2019T18:48:42,Runescail,probably~ :P
08-06-2019T18:48:51,Avolendi,Woot. Egyptian style it is xD
08-06-2019T18:48:59,TraceLegacyXI,Boy that was some typo thereo there

08-06-2019T18:49:52,RandomTonio,What’s happening?
08-06-2019T18:49:55,TraceLegacyXI,Yes it is
08-06-2019T18:50:18,PalmettoPathfinder1,Fem Keith is probably wearing the Ancient Egyptian outift that has two straps that cross between the breasts.
08-06-2019T18:50:19,CrRAR,[Keith]*:ctwokinds-maddiessparkles:*[such an inspiration!]

08-06-2019T18:56:32,tony1695,It is most definitely not just you
08-06-2019T18:56:35,unsteddyphoenix,I SHOULD abuse my powers?
08-06-2019T18:56:45,FloofyCat,"Yeah Teddy, abuse them on Nora."

08-06-2019T18:58:02,Avolendi,"Hehe. Wonder if Keith's text will be ' eh, I've had worse'"
08-06-2019T18:58:14,Tharkis,embrace the madness !
08-06-2019T18:58:21,Tharkis,the new slogan for Tom's sketch streams
08-06-2019T18:58:26,CrRAR,Not often you get to be a pretty Egyptian princess~
08-06-2019T18:58:28,NateDogg1232,Tharkis lol
08-06-2019T18:58:36,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Wonder if the lower part of Fem Keith's outfit will be see through.  Since well, a lot of Ancient Egyptian women's clothes were see through (well for the upper class mind you). But it depended on the outfit of course."
08-06-2019T18:58:39,IronHorseComics,"""You'll be turned into a turkey... on Thanksgiving"""
08-06-2019T18:59:11,CrRAR,dangerous

08-06-2019T18:59:26,RandomTonio,Laura wanted new friends
08-06-2019T18:59:32,RandomTonio,No one says no to Laura
08-06-2019T18:59:35,CrRAR,so... she died?
08-06-2019T18:59:40,NateDogg1232,I wonder if Tom ever gets tired of the chat lol.
08-06-2019T18:59:45,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Teddys rejection of 37 lag spiked my entire houses internet
08-06-2019T18:59:59,IronHorseComics,"nope, we're just too bonkers and unpredictable"
08-06-2019T19:00:02,Avolendi,I imagine he's ignoring most. Since otherwise it'd be rather distracting?
08-06-2019T19:00:03,unsteddyphoenix,...my powers have grown...
08-06-2019T19:00:15,CrRAR,Alaric was.... my one. truuue. friend. *hrrrkblegh*
08-06-2019T19:00:16,NateDogg1232,That's true. It probably is extremely distracting.
08-06-2019T19:00:32,NateDogg1232,"To be fair, it's distracting me too, lol. I should be working, but I'm def not."
08-06-2019T19:00:38,CrRAR,droop tail is droop
08-06-2019T19:00:42,metalman20,wait steddy's powers are growing.......*slowly starts trying to hide*
08-06-2019T19:00:48,FenceEqualizer,Just assume Tom ignores the insanity until keyywords pop up :ptv-laugh:
08-06-2019T19:01:34,KiTA,A turkey on thanksgiving
08-06-2019T19:01:35,NateDogg1232,That's probably a fair assumption
08-06-2019T19:01:36,Ordithus,takeout pork chop is yum <3
08-06-2019T19:01:39,KiTA,now I'm picturing a Turkey Keidrian
08-06-2019T19:01:48,Avolendi,"I think if you get used to it and are intent on ignoring it, it wouldn't be much of an issue"
08-06-2019T19:01:48,NateDogg1232,Oh my that'd be something else.
08-06-2019T19:01:50,Twokinds,Don't talk about food.
08-06-2019T19:01:50,KiTA,or or or
08-06-2019T19:01:57,CrRAR,Flora was a turkey once.
08-06-2019T19:01:58,KiTA,Peacock Keidrian
08-06-2019T19:01:58,FenceEqualizer,See
08-06-2019T19:02:06,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Tom eat something, we'll wait"
08-06-2019T19:02:07,Ordithus,Rocks.  Rocks aren't food.
08-06-2019T19:02:13,AspiringNoodle,...Now I'm hungry.
08-06-2019T19:02:15,NateDogg1232,Gotta agree with Marv.
08-06-2019T19:02:16,Avolendi,xD
08-06-2019T19:02:18,KiTA,remembering that Peacocks are male and Peahens are female...  but Peacocks are the only ones with fancy feathers
08-06-2019T19:02:33,KiTA,So Peacock Keidrians would be flamboyantly camp as hell
08-06-2019T19:02:33,CrRAR,yeh
08-06-2019T19:02:39,Avolendi,Neither is paper. But now i
08-06-2019T19:02:42,Xexanoth,...we need this colored...for reasons....
08-06-2019T19:02:43,Avolendi,'m winning
08-06-2019T19:02:44,steelabjur,That outfit is going to have Natani all over you again Keith!
08-06-2019T19:02:46,AspiringNoodle,"So, the larger and prettier the feathers, the more they're... compensating for something? :ptv-laugh:"
08-06-2019T19:02:58,KiTA,and Peahens would be drab stoic girls who are totally done with peacock's shit
08-06-2019T19:03:10,RandomTonio,"If Tom did raffles, what would happen?"
08-06-2019T19:03:12,CrRAR,the more chicks ya can pick up
08-06-2019T19:03:15,CrRAR,-L Tucker
08-06-2019T19:03:30,Mippy,Nothing Tonio.
08-06-2019T19:03:35,NateDogg1232,"If Tom did raffles, whatever website he does it with would die, Tonio"
08-06-2019T19:03:36,unsteddyphoenix,someone would win a raffle
08-06-2019T19:03:46,SpinoSpiritNinja,I'm currently tryin some fanart
08-06-2019T19:04:08,Mippy,"We'd celebrate then go  on to the next ""win nothing"" raffel"
08-06-2019T19:04:11,Avolendi,I'm currently watching a stream. Since I'm horrible at multitasking or anything like it
08-06-2019T19:04:29,NateDogg1232,"Avolendi, I'd kill for the ability to concentrate"
08-06-2019T19:04:37,unsteddyphoenix,"and then 599 people would come in later like ""was there a raffle?"""
08-06-2019T19:04:46,Mippy,XD
08-06-2019T19:04:50,metalman20,not being able to multitask is one of my bigger flaws.  i feel the pain
08-06-2019T19:04:53,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I would be one of them
08-06-2019T19:05:17,Avolendi,"I kinda know both sides of that. Generally very easily distracted, but can have hyper focus once I'm in the zone"
08-06-2019T19:05:41,Sclimshady,I would be the other 598
08-06-2019T19:05:44,FenceEqualizer,The richer side of toms fans may make multiple accounts
08-06-2019T19:05:47,NateDogg1232,"Avolendi, that's pretty close to me. Right now, I'm easily distracted."
08-06-2019T19:05:50,hoolibas,Wa:ctwokinds-RaineEep:it.. where's the raffle at?!
08-06-2019T19:06:16,thestooge2222,Raffle?
08-06-2019T19:06:20,hoolibas,"(See, this is how things get started)"
08-06-2019T19:06:21,Avolendi,"Although most of the time it's a deceptive concept. Deep focus work will very likely be crappy if you multitask, even if you can do it. Superficial stuff doesn't matter too much, like talking and eating icecream :P"
08-06-2019T19:06:25,Sclimshady,ruffles have ridges
08-06-2019T19:06:35,metalman20,and have many different flavors
08-06-2019T19:06:36,Mippy,lol
08-06-2019T19:06:51,hoolibas,hashtag all dressed

08-06-2019T19:07:48,NateDogg1232,Looks like Eric won by a landslide.
08-06-2019T19:07:52,AspiringNoodle,"Mike is getting his own poster, Eric deserves some love"
08-06-2019T19:08:07,steelabjur,we don't get to see Eric be fabulous nearly enough.
08-06-2019T19:08:08,CrRAR,ah

08-06-2019T19:08:18,InTheLionsDen,The suggestion was Mike and/or Evals

08-06-2019T19:08:29,Twokinds,Femeric or vixeneric

08-06-2019T21:55:07,RimaDraws,pretty good
08-06-2019T21:55:23,FenceEqualizer,You missed Smug Nibbly
08-06-2019T21:55:31,Dadrobit,Did a #QualitySuggestion get through?
08-06-2019T21:55:42,InTheLionsDen,"Fun and adorable sketches, as usual."
08-06-2019T21:56:56,unsteddyphoenix,what was yours?

08-06-2019T21:57:28,FenceEqualizer,No roller coaster I am afraid
08-06-2019T21:57:30,unsteddyphoenix,but smmug though
08-06-2019T21:57:45,Dadrobit,"Alas, it'll happen eventually."
08-06-2019T21:58:44,Dadrobit,"And on that day, Marv will be happy."
08-06-2019T21:58:58,unsteddyphoenix,Doin it for marv

08-06-2019T22:01:19,Dadrobit,"I really need to start writing down my suggestions. I get really good ones, but I can't remember them all when I come back down, and then I have to convince myself that they weren't really that good in the first place..."
08-06-2019T22:01:48,unsteddyphoenix,yeah I write down all of mine
08-06-2019T22:01:56,unsteddyphoenix,"And, to be fair, most fo them arent that good so"
08-06-2019T22:02:07,Dadrobit,Ouch...

08-06-2019T22:02:37,Ordithus,Mine are not great
08-06-2019T22:02:41,unsteddyphoenix,Most of mine that I write down arent that good
08-06-2019T22:02:46,Dadrobit,"Lmao, sick burnz yo"
08-06-2019T22:03:03,unsteddyphoenix,That was self banter I swear
08-06-2019T22:03:33,FenceEqualizer,Cooold bloooooded
08-06-2019T22:05:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera’s feeling viscous. Everyone hide
08-06-2019T22:05:41,Ordithus,poke the kitty
08-06-2019T22:06:18,SpazztasticKiwi,arm is under siege. No reinforcements expected
08-06-2019T22:06:25,unsteddyphoenix,just boop
08-06-2019T22:07:01,SpazztasticKiwi,headscratch accepted
08-06-2019T22:07:10,unsteddyphoenix,well executed
08-06-2019T22:07:17,RimaDraws,mow?
08-06-2019T22:07:49,SpazztasticKiwi,He’s not biting hard or anything. Just having a special moment. Just a purring
08-06-2019T22:13:04,RimaDraws,awwwwww
08-06-2019T22:13:20,SpazztasticKiwi,I remember I have a back massager. Hold on I’m gonna see what his reaction is
08-06-2019T22:14:06,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-floAAA:
08-06-2019T22:14:17,RimaDraws,o.o
08-06-2019T22:15:48,SpazztasticKiwi,he is so very confused
08-06-2019T22:16:06,SpazztasticKiwi,“oh. Toy. I nap”
08-06-2019T22:16:13,SpazztasticKiwi,bap
08-06-2019T22:16:54,Dadrobit,"Watching the Bethesda E3 showcase right now. No joke, I think they mic'd up a few dozen people to cheer and are piping it directly into the audio feed."
08-06-2019T22:17:22,SpazztasticKiwi,“cheer on cue into this mic”
08-06-2019T22:17:25,SpazztasticKiwi,“Why?”
08-06-2019T22:17:34,SpazztasticKiwi,“We have money”
08-06-2019T22:17:44,Dadrobit,"The crowd looks at best only mildly interested, maybe one out a dozen folks are clapping. But the audio sounds like it's a rapturous crowd."
08-06-2019T22:17:47,SpazztasticKiwi,“Who am I rooting for again?”
08-06-2019T22:17:51,Dadrobit,out of a*
08-06-2019T22:18:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera is throughly befuzzled by buzzing moving pillow
08-06-2019T22:19:03,FenceEqualizer,I'd believe it can't risk having your presentation looking dull
08-06-2019T22:20:35,SpazztasticKiwi,"which reminds me - how’s your shoulders sitting at that same spot for so long, Tom"
08-06-2019T22:24:32,ZahnHolley,Good night Tom Thankyou
08-06-2019T22:24:46,Twokinds,I'm used to it
08-06-2019T22:25:05,ZahnHolley,I’m going to bed
08-06-2019T22:26:32,RimaDraws,;;
08-06-2019T22:26:53,Dadrobit,"Holy shit. This is actually terrible. Bethesda isn't even trying to hide it. Two rows deep, center stage are the paid crowd members, (maybe employees?). Every time they announce something it's ONLY those people that are reacting and cheering and giving"
08-06-2019T22:26:56,Dadrobit,standing ovations.
08-06-2019T22:27:41,FenceEqualizer,That's freaking hilarious.
08-06-2019T22:27:42,Dadrobit,"It's honestly super sad. I fucking love the Elder Scroll series, and this is how they have to present themselves now?"
08-06-2019T22:27:45,RimaDraws,ouch
08-06-2019T22:29:51,FenceEqualizer,Well they're taking forever to get there flag ship title out. Fallout was a huge bust from the sound of things and there elder scroll phone app sounds like a hard money grab without the bells and whistle to jeep you entertain
08-06-2019T22:30:18,SpazztasticKiwi,they’ll do what they have to
08-06-2019T22:30:20,Dadrobit,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DN0Co-wrElU&t=27m16s Look at the front row. Everyone else is just kinda golf clapping
08-06-2019T22:30:28,SpazztasticKiwi,or “have” to
08-06-2019T22:30:47,FenceEqualizer,That like ratio is already a bad sign
08-06-2019T22:31:27,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t remember why I put this pillow up
08-06-2019T22:31:37,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s my shoulders buddy now
08-06-2019T22:32:29,FenceEqualizer,Uuhhh this is pretty bad they made it so obvious.
08-06-2019T22:33:18,FenceEqualizer,Like I can't tell if that one guy cheering is just being a dick or not
08-06-2019T22:33:35,Twokinds,Jeeez the cheering is fake XD
08-06-2019T22:33:53,RimaDraws,lol
08-06-2019T22:33:55,FenceEqualizer,Right!?
08-06-2019T22:33:55,SpazztasticKiwi,"canned praise, at your service"
08-06-2019T22:34:13,SpazztasticKiwi,no fresh stuff allowed
08-06-2019T22:34:19,Twokinds,Gotta all their audience cheerleaders mic'd up
08-06-2019T22:35:07,unsteddyphoenix,I just found my ideal career path
08-06-2019T22:35:14,SpazztasticKiwi,How much were the screamers paid?
08-06-2019T22:35:23,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m loud and have a bank account
08-06-2019T22:35:23,unsteddyphoenix,I wanna be a professional clapper
08-06-2019T22:35:27,unsteddyphoenix,Exactly
08-06-2019T22:35:33,Twokinds,paid in enhanced editions of Skyrim
08-06-2019T22:35:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Eh
08-06-2019T22:35:49,unsteddyphoenix,Haha
08-06-2019T22:35:58,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ll take mint compiles of Shakespeare
08-06-2019T22:36:14,Dadrobit,"I will admit though, the new Elsweyr cinematic got me with the Khajiit face to face with a dragon returning a roar with a hiss."
08-06-2019T22:36:17,AspiringNoodle,Tbh... Randy Pitchford doesn't inspire confidence...
08-06-2019T22:37:08,Dadrobit,Randy Pitchford is Gearbox and Borderlands 3. No relation to Bethesda.
08-06-2019T22:37:10,FenceEqualizer,Why are you standing you fools?
08-06-2019T22:37:19,AspiringNoodle,Oh bleh.
08-06-2019T22:37:44,RimaDraws,these people are such tools
08-06-2019T22:37:52,AspiringNoodle,Meant Todd Howard >_>
08-06-2019T22:37:56,AspiringNoodle,I suck at names I guess.
08-06-2019T22:38:21,SpazztasticKiwi,oh they made a movie of Coriolanus
08-06-2019T22:38:24,SpazztasticKiwi,nice
08-06-2019T22:38:27,FenceEqualizer,They just made it way to obvious.
08-06-2019T22:38:45,AspiringNoodle,"Anyways, his philosophy is ""It does not matter if a game is utter shit at launch, as long as it becomes something good later"""
08-06-2019T22:38:51,SpazztasticKiwi,“How can we be obnoxious with how fake we are?”
08-06-2019T22:39:01,AspiringNoodle,"My paraphrase, not an actual quote"
08-06-2019T22:39:05,Dadrobit,Did the speaker get three words in a row? Time to cheer!!!
08-06-2019T22:39:06,SpazztasticKiwi,“Standing screaming ovation of paid actors and employees”
08-06-2019T22:39:11,SpazztasticKiwi,“Brilliant Jim”
08-06-2019T22:39:47,AspiringNoodle,Doesn't another studio develop ESO?
08-06-2019T22:40:02,SpazztasticKiwi,“Scream like the love of your life announced your first baby”
08-06-2019T22:40:27,FenceEqualizer,"Commaaander Keeeen omg! ""Faints in the crowd"""
08-06-2019T22:40:41,AspiringNoodle,"I watched 5 seconds then noped out, haha"
08-06-2019T22:40:59,Dadrobit,"ZeniMax, but they're under the Bethesda umbrella"
08-06-2019T22:42:07,AspiringNoodle,It's a shame... I considered applying to Bethesda.  Live close enough that moving wouldn't be too big a hassle.  But I no longer trust the AAA industry.  At all :/
08-06-2019T22:42:14,FenceEqualizer,Being a little dramatic maybe but the crowd is making it hard to watch.
08-06-2019T22:42:32,FenceEqualizer,Take it from someone who works at a major game company
08-06-2019T22:42:42,FenceEqualizer,It's fracking thankless as hell
08-06-2019T22:42:56,AspiringNoodle,"Overworked, underpaid, 0 appreciation?"
08-06-2019T22:42:56,Dadrobit,"Actually, sorry, I have that backwards, ZeniMax Media owns Bethesda"
08-06-2019T22:43:11,FenceEqualizer,"Yep, what I signed up for"
08-06-2019T22:43:18,AspiringNoodle,Thaaaaaaaaaat's what I thought...
08-06-2019T22:43:30,FenceEqualizer,Honestly coworkers and just a love for gaming in general keeps me working there
08-06-2019T22:43:53,AspiringNoodle,Probably doesn't help that greedy publishers are pushing for live service models that make the industry's use of crunch nearly epidemic.
08-06-2019T22:44:02,Dadrobit,And ZeniMax Online Studios is a subsidiary of ZeniMax Media that develops ESO.
08-06-2019T22:44:05,FenceEqualizer,Honestly.....
08-06-2019T22:44:16,FenceEqualizer,Games as a service is kinda job security
08-06-2019T22:44:52,FenceEqualizer,More dlc means more testing means more work.
08-06-2019T22:44:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Y’all FAKE
08-06-2019T22:45:01,AspiringNoodle,So you're QA?
08-06-2019T22:45:11,FenceEqualizer,Yeeeeep
08-06-2019T22:45:26,FenceEqualizer,Kiwi my heart 💔
08-06-2019T22:45:38,AspiringNoodle,"Oof.  From what I understand, you're just below developers in terms of respect.  But get worked just as hard and provide one of the most pivotal roles :/"
08-06-2019T22:46:08,SpazztasticKiwi,The video Fence
08-06-2019T22:46:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Focus
08-06-2019T22:46:13,SpazztasticKiwi,I nope out harder if you try pushing or convincing me of something rather than showing me and letting me think
08-06-2019T22:46:18,FenceEqualizer,"And the high turnover rate, and now getting close to doing programmer work but getting paid little"
08-06-2019T22:46:28,FenceEqualizer,Hah!
08-06-2019T22:47:10,FenceEqualizer,Though bot trying to bite the hand that feeds me so don't want to say too much
08-06-2019T22:47:17,FenceEqualizer,Not*
08-06-2019T22:47:25,Dadrobit,":/ Kinda almost glad I never finished my degree in game design. Had a level design job waiting for me at Rainbow Studios, but between me never finishing my degree, and THQ going under, that career never panned out."
08-06-2019T22:47:42,AspiringNoodle,It does break my heart that the people who actually make the games get paid so little and no respect for all the work they do MAKING the product that makes the publishers filthy rich.
08-06-2019T22:48:32,Twokinds,Yeah.
08-06-2019T22:48:40,Twokinds,That's most industries.
08-06-2019T22:48:50,FenceEqualizer,Yeah it's kinda shitty. Why you have to really love what you do
08-06-2019T22:49:55,FenceEqualizer,Makes me wish I had a suave voice. Would love to work as a voice actor and continue knowing I have a hand and whatever game I work on
08-06-2019T22:50:25,AspiringNoodle,I lack all the confidence! :ptv-greetings:
08-06-2019T22:51:04,Dadrobit,Voice actors get fucked plenty in the game business as well.
08-06-2019T22:51:46,FenceEqualizer,Blargh
08-06-2019T22:51:52,Dadrobit,"Royalties just aren't a thing, so even if the game you voice goes on to make unreasonable amounts of money, you still only get the hourly wage that was agreed upon up front."
08-06-2019T22:52:32,Dadrobit,"And generally you aren't told what you're working on before you get there so you can't negotiate for more money. They just give you a ""working title""."
08-06-2019T22:52:50,AspiringNoodle,"""Girl with pet cat"" xD"
08-06-2019T22:53:37,Dadrobit,Even happened to Borderlands 3
08-06-2019T22:54:24,Dadrobit,"Claptrap VA was harassed, assaulted, and then not paid for their work. Then they threw him under the bus for BL3."
08-06-2019T22:54:43,AspiringNoodle,That's probably why I confused names.  Randy is also a douchebag :D
08-06-2019T22:54:58,FenceEqualizer,What...what!? Why was he harassed? Thought people liked that character?
08-06-2019T22:55:04,AspiringNoodle,Randy's a dick
08-06-2019T22:55:09,Dadrobit,By Randy Pitchford
08-06-2019T22:55:24,FenceEqualizer,Huh
08-06-2019T22:55:29,AspiringNoodle,That dude has narcissistic and sociopathic tendencies...
08-06-2019T22:56:04,Dadrobit,"Gearbox ""announced"" that David Eddings didn't want to come back to voice Claptrap in 3."
08-06-2019T22:56:40,Dadrobit,"That's when the allegations came out. Eddings even said that he WANTED to voice Claptrap, on the condition that he was paid what he was due."
08-06-2019T22:56:48,AspiringNoodle,^
08-06-2019T22:56:53,FenceEqualizer,That's kinda messed up.
08-06-2019T22:56:58,Dadrobit,"So Geabox made that ""announcement"""
08-06-2019T22:57:00,AspiringNoodle,They wanted him to do the voice acting for free
08-06-2019T22:57:04,Dadrobit,Gearbox*
08-06-2019T22:57:09,AspiringNoodle,Because that's what he did for the first 2 games
08-06-2019T22:57:37,AspiringNoodle,"But he was in a high paying position at Gearbox when he did that voice acting, so it could be considered part of his ""duties"" within the company."
08-06-2019T22:57:54,AspiringNoodle,"Now that he doesn't work there anymore, it's completely within reason that he ask to be paid"
08-06-2019T22:58:08,AspiringNoodle,"But nope, they're a bunch of greedy bastards"
08-06-2019T22:58:45,AspiringNoodle,"It's like, every time I turn around, it becomes easier and easier to keep track of the list of games and publishers that DON'T piss me off"
08-06-2019T22:58:46,FenceEqualizer,They sound like scumbags. The gaming industry is a mess I swear
08-06-2019T22:59:20,AspiringNoodle,I'm a bit behind on some modern titles.  But one of my favorite series has always been Battlefield.  I LOVE the multiplayer in that game.
08-06-2019T22:59:26,Dadrobit,Treatment of VA talent in the video game industry is and has been so bad that SAG-AFTRA went on strike for the whole industry for a while.
08-06-2019T22:59:31,AspiringNoodle,But the politics surrounding Battlefield 5 turned me off so hard...
08-06-2019T23:00:26,AspiringNoodle,I think I'll take advice from a youtuber I watched recently
08-06-2019T23:00:50,Dadrobit,Lasted 11 months
08-06-2019T23:00:58,AspiringNoodle,"Take my computer science degree, get a programming job in a non-game development industry.  Enjoy my higher pay with less work, and use that extra time to pursue my ""passion"" as a ""hobby"""
08-06-2019T23:01:31,AspiringNoodle,"And with enough effort / luck, that'll start making money :ptv-hearts:"
08-06-2019T23:02:34,FenceEqualizer,"Sounds like a good plan honestly, better pay actual benefits and chances are you'll have continuous work."
08-06-2019T23:03:11,RimaDraws,well guys i must get off here. nice to talk to you all again this weekend and have fun. <3 night all! night Tom! o/
08-06-2019T23:03:16,AspiringNoodle,It's actually another reason I didn't apply to Bethesda :ptv-confused:
08-06-2019T23:03:20,Dadrobit,o/
08-06-2019T23:03:25,FenceEqualizer,Have a good night Rima!
08-06-2019T23:03:26,Ordithus,night rima o/
08-06-2019T23:03:31,AspiringNoodle,Night! :ptv-greetings:
08-06-2019T23:03:36,FenceEqualizer,You both made the right choice!
08-06-2019T23:03:59,AspiringNoodle,If crunch is as bad as all the horror stories say... I'd more or less be living at the office every so often.
08-06-2019T23:04:14,FenceEqualizer,15 hours baby
08-06-2019T23:04:30,AspiringNoodle,It's like... forgetting about doing art on the side.
08-06-2019T23:04:41,AspiringNoodle,I'll be lucky to even see a movie once in a blue moon.
08-06-2019T23:05:04,FenceEqualizer,You live for the weekend.
08-06-2019T23:05:10,Ordithus,15 hours dafuq peple can't work like that.  they don't work like that
08-06-2019T23:05:22,AspiringNoodle,Freetime in general.  I could adapt to w/e
08-06-2019T23:05:49,FenceEqualizer,Well 13.5 but we don't don't get paid lunch/dinner
08-06-2019T23:06:03,AspiringNoodle,The joys of salary?
08-06-2019T23:06:21,FenceEqualizer,"And you can, though they try to keep it as a choice"
08-06-2019T23:06:40,AspiringNoodle,"Tbh, labor laws probably need updating.  As it stands, ""creative professionals"" get the shaft."
08-06-2019T23:06:43,FenceEqualizer,Most understand people can't work like that for too long
08-06-2019T23:07:20,FenceEqualizer,Though i'll tell you one thing it's fun to see people lose there minds
08-06-2019T23:07:31,AspiringNoodle,"Imagine how much these industries would change if the law said, ""Employees can not work longer than X hours per week."""
08-06-2019T23:07:48,Ordithus,Yeah that's what happens.  The overworking kills the worker
08-06-2019T23:08:07,FenceEqualizer,Had a coworker get dragged from his chair cause he wouldn't stop playing uganda knuckle remix on the music site we used lol
08-06-2019T23:08:11,AspiringNoodle,"The law allows it, and there's an endless supply of ""useful idiots"" looking to break into the industry who will gladly take it"
08-06-2019T23:08:44,AspiringNoodle,"Until the supply pool dries up, or there's a union / law change, things are gonna be like this for a while..."
08-06-2019T23:08:48,Ordithus,We had 50-60 hour weeks for over a year (not games industry)
08-06-2019T23:08:58,Ordithus,"I didn't, and didn't get fired, so great"
08-06-2019T23:09:00,FenceEqualizer,The supply pool will never dry up
08-06-2019T23:09:11,Ordithus,But I caught sooooo many mistakes my coworkers were maing
08-06-2019T23:09:14,Ordithus,making
08-06-2019T23:09:18,AspiringNoodle,And that's why a union WILL happen eventually ^^;
08-06-2019T23:09:25,FenceEqualizer,Because it's games. So many people just don't know better
08-06-2019T23:09:30,AspiringNoodle,Unless laws change to stop this kind of blatant worker exploitation
08-06-2019T23:09:54,FenceEqualizer,"They'll always be able to resupply workers cause it's like a ""dream job"""
08-06-2019T23:09:58,SpazztasticKiwi,🍿
08-06-2019T23:10:09,AspiringNoodle,"Tbh, I find it ludicrous that the law doesn't realize that putting no upper limit on certain jobs will foster abuse."
08-06-2019T23:10:19,Ordithus,":ctwokinds-rose: ooh share, kiwi?"
08-06-2019T23:11:34,AspiringNoodle,"Ultimately, money talks in business.  If the current system works and brings in all the money, there's no incentive to change :/"
08-06-2019T23:11:55,FenceEqualizer,"Yep, just wish they throw some of that my way"
08-06-2019T23:12:03,SpazztasticKiwi,you can have it. I’m admiring my shiny nails
08-06-2019T23:12:08,AspiringNoodle,Don't get me started on that little nugget of shining bs
08-06-2019T23:12:21,SpazztasticKiwi,All filed clean and glossy
08-06-2019T23:12:29,Ordithus,fancy~ can you fit popcorn through the internet
08-06-2019T23:12:38,SpazztasticKiwi,we can try
08-06-2019T23:12:53,AspiringNoodle,"I love how every single mother nibblin' publisher talks about, ""Oh, we need microtransactions!  Games are just SOOOOOOO expensive to make these days"" :ptv-whiny:"
08-06-2019T23:12:55,FenceEqualizer,Would you download a bag of popcorn?
08-06-2019T23:12:57,Ordithus,:popcorn::ctwokinds-reniderp_flip:
08-06-2019T23:13:14,SpazztasticKiwi,nice and fancy indeed. All the better to scratch people with
08-06-2019T23:13:22,AspiringNoodle,Then where does all that fat microtransaction cash go?  Into the pockets of millionare executives who already make more money than God knows what to do with...
08-06-2019T23:13:36,FenceEqualizer,So violent. :ptv-shock:
08-06-2019T23:13:48,AspiringNoodle,SCRATCH THE CEOS OF AAA PUBLISHERS
08-06-2019T23:13:50,AspiringNoodle,DO EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEET
08-06-2019T23:13:51,Ordithus,did you get the fancy scratchy thingamajig
08-06-2019T23:14:05,SpazztasticKiwi,..a nail file?
08-06-2019T23:14:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Ya
08-06-2019T23:14:20,SpazztasticKiwi,I have a full nail kit. Manicures are ridiculous
08-06-2019T23:14:33,Ordithus,"No, that self defense thing"
08-06-2019T23:14:39,Ordithus,Looks like a wicked hangnail
08-06-2019T23:14:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Nah. Never found where it’s sold
08-06-2019T23:14:54,Ordithus,ah
08-06-2019T23:14:59,SpazztasticKiwi,But my nails have grown rather long
08-06-2019T23:15:25,SpazztasticKiwi,and if all else fails I’ll tase them wherever I manage to reach
08-06-2019T23:15:42,Ordithus,that'll do
08-06-2019T23:18:29,SpazztasticKiwi,also did you know that if you stab a finger into the base of the throat hard enough you can cause an immediate choke response
08-06-2019T23:18:47,FenceEqualizer,Could always get those razor nails from amazon
08-06-2019T23:19:09,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m not too worried about it. I only run at the park
08-06-2019T23:19:24,Ordithus,I did not know
08-06-2019T23:19:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Cameras. Often times at least one other person there. And houses nearby
08-06-2019T23:20:04,SpazztasticKiwi,besides someone wants to kidnap me would bring me back
08-06-2019T23:20:13,Bgrmystr2,Just gonna come and say you bet your fuckin ass I'd download popcorn.
08-06-2019T23:20:16,Bgrmystr2,Fuck yes man
08-06-2019T23:20:19,Bgrmystr2,give me that.
08-06-2019T23:20:31,AspiringNoodle,I need to go grocery shopping tomorrow.  And guess what I'm not buying?
08-06-2019T23:20:31,FenceEqualizer,Heathen!
08-06-2019T23:20:38,Bgrmystr2,"fuck you, it's free popcorn. XD"
08-06-2019T23:20:52,Ordithus,"""Tastes like... plastic, glass, and bits of metal"""
08-06-2019T23:21:01,Bgrmystr2,I can copy/paste it all day every day and the original will NEVER DISAPPEAR
08-06-2019T23:21:01,SpazztasticKiwi,when we can download food the world will implode
08-06-2019T23:21:03,Bgrmystr2,it's amazing
08-06-2019T23:21:47,SpazztasticKiwi,I only wonder why they don’t plant fruit trees in cities where they have decorative street trees
08-06-2019T23:21:54,Bgrmystr2,"I'd download my food, a car, clothes, anything."
08-06-2019T23:21:58,Bgrmystr2,Gemme gemme.
08-06-2019T23:22:04,Bgrmystr2,Yes I would.
08-06-2019T23:22:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Besides the ones that wouldn’t get grabbed and animals
08-06-2019T23:22:45,FenceEqualizer,Did the movie warnings teach you anything!?
08-06-2019T23:22:54,Ordithus,fruit trees make messes
08-06-2019T23:22:56,FenceEqualizer,You're not suppose to download a car
08-06-2019T23:23:30,Ordithus,I'd love to 3d print a car
08-06-2019T23:23:37,Ordithus,A real car
08-06-2019T23:23:40,Ordithus,vroom
08-06-2019T23:23:52,unsteddyphoenix,I'll 3D print a gun then 3D rob your 3D car >:)
08-06-2019T23:24:08,Bgrmystr2,There has NEVER been a single movie warning that told me not to download a car. Ever. Not once.
08-06-2019T23:24:22,Bgrmystr2,So I can safely say no. There's been no warning cuz that's ridiculous. xD
08-06-2019T23:24:37,Bgrmystr2,Can't learn from something that's never existed~
08-06-2019T23:24:43,FenceEqualizer,Man am I showing my age?
08-06-2019T23:25:01,Bgrmystr2,"Naw prolly not, I just don't watch movies."
08-06-2019T23:25:02,Ordithus,:cw0lfmare-PaperemberClose: why would you do this to me teddy
08-06-2019T23:25:09,SpazztasticKiwi,I can easily download transportation. It’s called a jog app
08-06-2019T23:25:19,FenceEqualizer,I swear they use to always have those silly advertisements before the movie starts
08-06-2019T23:25:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Get to places. Gas free
08-06-2019T23:25:42,Bgrmystr2,that's not downloading antyhing lol
08-06-2019T23:25:51,Ordithus,range is limited
08-06-2019T23:26:32,SpazztasticKiwi,the app would just help keep you on track
08-06-2019T23:26:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Health app shows me how much I walk every day
08-06-2019T23:27:16,FenceEqualizer,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmZm8vNHBSU ""You wouldn't download a car would you?"""
08-06-2019T23:27:22,Ordithus,Well tomorrow I'm going to walk a couple miles
08-06-2019T23:27:26,SpazztasticKiwi,I did 4.7 miles today
08-06-2019T23:27:26,Ordithus,without leaving my yard
08-06-2019T23:27:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Awhoo
08-06-2019T23:27:51,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-awoo:
08-06-2019T23:28:10,unsteddyphoenix,man I love that ad
08-06-2019T23:28:14,unsteddyphoenix,STEALING
08-06-2019T23:28:15,unsteddyphoenix,IS AGAINST
08-06-2019T23:28:17,unsteddyphoenix,THE LAW
08-06-2019T23:28:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Although I wonder why that include that it equals 12 floors of stairs climes because I can promise you if I’d walked that many flights I’d be dead
08-06-2019T23:28:42,Bgrmystr2,but.. that's wrong.
08-06-2019T23:28:49,AspiringNoodle,I love anti-piracy ads.
08-06-2019T23:28:52,Bgrmystr2,it's not stealing.
08-06-2019T23:28:54,Bgrmystr2,It's copying.
08-06-2019T23:28:58,Bgrmystr2,There's a difference.
08-06-2019T23:29:04,AspiringNoodle,"The logic is a bit messed up, tbh."
08-06-2019T23:29:06,Dadrobit,Those were out around the time of the Quizos ads
08-06-2019T23:29:07,Bgrmystr2,the original source is completely untouched.
08-06-2019T23:29:09,Dadrobit,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZrks-BPeLQ
08-06-2019T23:29:20,AspiringNoodle,"First off, digital media is reproducible infinitely, especially now with everything going digital."
08-06-2019T23:29:39,AspiringNoodle,"Second, the people who pirated the stuff likely were never going to obtain the movie legitimately anyways."
08-06-2019T23:29:55,FenceEqualizer,Omg that quizno ad!
08-06-2019T23:30:03,FenceEqualizer,That's such a blast from the past
08-06-2019T23:30:06,Dadrobit,You're stealing the limited use license that is distributed with the individual sales of the movie.
08-06-2019T23:30:52,AspiringNoodle,There's actually a fascinating debate about this somewhere.
08-06-2019T23:31:29,Dadrobit,THEY GOT A PEPPER BAR
08-06-2019T23:31:31,AspiringNoodle,Some studios arguing that piracy of their product is free advertising or something along those lines.
08-06-2019T23:32:46,FenceEqualizer,I'm turning that into my text tone.
08-06-2019T23:32:55,Dadrobit,LOL
08-06-2019T23:32:58,FenceEqualizer,THEY GOT A PEPPER BAR
08-06-2019T23:33:02,Dadrobit,I'm tempted to do the same tbh.
08-06-2019T23:33:19,Dadrobit,"Got a new phone, still haven't done much to customize it yet."
08-06-2019T23:34:06,AspiringNoodle,I would love to buy a theme for my phone that is nature oriented
08-06-2019T23:35:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I want to make my ringtone screams
08-06-2019T23:35:42,SpazztasticKiwi,But not just anyone screaming
08-06-2019T23:35:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Seán
08-06-2019T23:36:03,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-nataniAAAAshake:
08-06-2019T23:36:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Just so I can have my pocket randomly yell when I get a call
08-06-2019T23:36:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Any of you heard the mom ringtone?
08-06-2019T23:37:03,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-RainezZz: good night all~ see you next time
08-06-2019T23:37:03,FenceEqualizer,"No, what's that?"
08-06-2019T23:37:07,Dadrobit,o/ Ord
08-06-2019T23:37:10,FenceEqualizer,Later Ord!
08-06-2019T23:37:26,SpazztasticKiwi,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z32DKW5Uctg hopefully the link works
08-06-2019T23:39:14,Bgrmystr2,I know someone who had that.
08-06-2019T23:39:18,Bgrmystr2,wayyyy back
08-06-2019T23:39:30,FenceEqualizer,"lol kiwi, I think one of my older friends had that."
08-06-2019T23:43:01,SpazztasticKiwi,cept for the dad part it’s basically my mother
08-06-2019T23:43:15,SpazztasticKiwi,She could talk the paint off a fence
08-06-2019T23:44:51,FenceEqualizer,Would be the perfect ringtone for when your mom calls then
08-06-2019T23:46:37,FenceEqualizer,"Alright all, going to head out. Had fun shooting the breeze with you all but need sleep."
08-06-2019T23:47:04,FenceEqualizer,Have a good night everyone and see you again! :ptv-greetings:
08-06-2019T23:48:15,Dadrobit,Have a good one all y'all.
08-06-2019T23:48:29,AspiringNoodle,I have YT videos to watch
