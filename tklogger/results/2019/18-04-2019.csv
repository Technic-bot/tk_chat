18-04-2019T06:49:22,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-natsducky:
18-04-2019T09:43:46,TheOtherEric,Question I've wondered for a while:  Is Keidran pronounced KEE-drin or KY-drin?
18-04-2019T09:48:36,BadFoMo,"KY-drin, if I remember right."
18-04-2019T10:43:08,Mippy,Always the KY never the KEE. I know there is a joke in there somewhere
18-04-2019T11:14:05,Combak,And here I always said in KEE.
18-04-2019T11:31:29,Taremong,So have I been alone in saying Kay-eh-dran?
18-04-2019T11:55:10,Xexanoth,"i just pronounce it ""Keidran"" :ptv-SteelwormHades:"

18-04-2019T12:22:31,TerraTheWizard,but /shrug
18-04-2019T12:28:03,tehbear,Keydran anyone?
18-04-2019T12:29:30,TerraTheWizard,"key = kee , no?"
18-04-2019T12:29:57,tehbear,Yes. Its the same then
18-04-2019T12:32:12,tehbear,I wonder if the keidran call themselves that or if it was the humans that came up with it
18-04-2019T12:33:39,TerraTheWizard,i'm sure they have a word in their language that sounds similar
18-04-2019T12:33:56,TerraTheWizard,and the humans just did their best to figure out how to write it

18-04-2019T14:36:35,iliar,Are there bad ghosts in TK?  Laura is good.  Saria is good.  Who else?
18-04-2019T14:36:54,CrimsonQuill,I meant in relation to Ghostbusters.
18-04-2019T14:37:01,CrimsonQuill,Of course TK ghosts are nice.
18-04-2019T14:37:10,CrimsonQuill,They're nice people.
18-04-2019T14:39:10,SpazztasticKiwi,bad choice of wordplay there Xexan
18-04-2019T14:40:11,SpazztasticKiwi,good butt drawer because they’re all the same butts just multiplied by near 15 years. He should be good by then

18-04-2019T16:10:58,iliar,But at least the result of the diet is?
18-04-2019T16:12:48,Azumachan,A diet should be played like a marathon. The goal is in the long run.
18-04-2019T16:14:26,Twokinds,"I've been on it for about a week or less, and lost 3 lbs so far, or 1.36kg"
18-04-2019T16:15:07,Azumachan,"That's great, but the first week is usually water loss."
18-04-2019T16:15:44,Twokinds,"That's excersizing, isn't it?"
18-04-2019T16:15:52,iliar,A week? Have you taken a break? It seemed to me that you have long been on a diet.
18-04-2019T16:16:09,Twokinds,I haven't changed how much I'm exerting myself. If anything I'm drinking more water.
18-04-2019T16:16:22,Azumachan,Part of it yes.
18-04-2019T16:16:23,Twokinds,And salt.
18-04-2019T16:16:41,Twokinds,It's just no carbs.
18-04-2019T16:17:26,Twokinds,"And no, iliar, I only started cutting carbs the last week"
18-04-2019T16:18:03,Azumachan,Cutting calories intakes by a 1/3 a day amount around 1h of exercise and a net 0.2 pounds of fat loss
18-04-2019T16:18:45,iliar,Hm It seemed to me that you have been doing this for a long time. A couple of months ago you talked about dieting and I also decided that I needed to lose weight.
18-04-2019T16:19:01,Twokinds,Yeah that was just general cutting back.
18-04-2019T16:19:07,Twokinds,I didn't give up sugar until now.
18-04-2019T16:22:14,iliar,"I gave up sweetwater. But almost did not change the rest of the ration. Yes, this is probably a stupid diet when you eat pure pig fat. But I lost 6 kg, and then progress stopped."
18-04-2019T16:22:16,Azumachan,9 teaspoons  is the recommended intake of sugar
18-04-2019T16:22:57,Azumachan,"Rations and meal preps helps, plus it saves time ."
18-04-2019T16:24:06,Twokinds,13.5lbs is good though
18-04-2019T16:24:31,Twokinds,My goal is -9kg
18-04-2019T16:25:02,iliar,Not for me. My goal is much further.
18-04-2019T16:25:08,Azumachan,6 months
18-04-2019T16:29:23,iliar,A little offtopic. Himawari 8 is a Japanese weather satellite. This satellite takes a photo of our Еarth every 10 minutes. I downloaded data from this satellite. 70 gigabytes of data. Several hours of processing.

18-04-2019T16:30:23,iliar,I like how it looks in 4K
18-04-2019T16:30:46,Azumachan,cool you have the satlink ?
18-04-2019T16:31:55,iliar,Not. Data is available for download (although I had to write a program that downloads so many files)
18-04-2019T16:54:58,Dadrobit,Thtat's awesome stuff man!
18-04-2019T16:59:27,Azumachan,I love the sentinel service

18-04-2019T17:44:16,Twokinds,Why is wound spelled the same as wound.
18-04-2019T17:44:21,Twokinds,And wind is spelled the same as wind.
18-04-2019T17:44:29,Bgrmystr2,xD
18-04-2019T17:46:14,Twokinds,The winding wind wound around the wound.

18-04-2019T17:48:35,TerraTheWizard,english is the worst
18-04-2019T17:48:47,iliar,You can not even imagine how many problems this creates when translating.

18-04-2019T17:51:06,Azumachan,Polish ? Chinese ?
18-04-2019T17:51:13,TerraTheWizard,english has its good and bad points
18-04-2019T17:51:18,TerraTheWizard,mostly good
18-04-2019T17:51:22,TerraTheWizard,but the bad ones are bad
18-04-2019T17:51:34,Bgrmystr2,"english is not necessarily bad, simply complex."
18-04-2019T17:51:37,TheOtherEric,Im an idiot and didnt see the messages. I missed if anyone answered on the pronunciation of Keidran
18-04-2019T17:52:00,TerraTheWizard,i can't remember what the official answer is
18-04-2019T17:52:01,TerraTheWizard,lol
18-04-2019T17:52:01,Bgrmystr2,"lol a bunch of people did, but it's pronounced k-eye-dran"
18-04-2019T17:52:05,Azumachan,That's on the wiki.
18-04-2019T17:52:14,Bgrmystr2,most people who replied to you were wrong anyway haha
18-04-2019T17:52:20,TheOtherEric,Qell then ive been pronouncing ut whong the whole time
18-04-2019T17:52:27,TheOtherEric,Wow i cant type
18-04-2019T17:52:29,TerraTheWizard,i knew *i* was wrong
18-04-2019T17:52:30,TerraTheWizard,lol
18-04-2019T17:52:30,Bgrmystr2,"in fact, I don't think any of them had it right xD"
18-04-2019T17:52:34,TheOtherEric,*it *wrong
18-04-2019T17:52:41,Twokinds,It's pronounced Queadrown
18-04-2019T17:52:50,TerraTheWizard,Que?
18-04-2019T17:52:53,Bgrmystr2,tom no xD
18-04-2019T17:52:56,TheOtherEric,Tom hath spoken
18-04-2019T17:53:05,Bgrmystr2,tom's a trollface
18-04-2019T17:53:23,TerraTheWizard,"i never trust tom saying how things are pronounced after that time he ""told"" me how to say euchre"
18-04-2019T17:53:56,TerraTheWizard,still stumble on that in my internal monologue
18-04-2019T17:54:08,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-flomad:
18-04-2019T17:54:14,Mihari,I never trust anything Tom says unless I can hear him say it and know if he doesn't have a short giggle after it.
18-04-2019T17:54:26,TerraTheWizard,lol
18-04-2019T17:54:45,TheOtherEric,"Ive been saying KEE-drin this whole time, cuz thats what my brain defaulted to"
18-04-2019T17:55:27,Azumachan,"It's pronounced  ""keidran"", <keidran> or keidran"
18-04-2019T17:55:37,TheOtherEric,Ah yes
18-04-2019T17:55:56,TerraTheWizard,i think it depends on what your 'local' not-english language is
18-04-2019T17:56:02,TerraTheWizard,what you default to
18-04-2019T17:56:10,TheOtherEric,English lol
18-04-2019T17:56:20,TheOtherEric,I know no other language
18-04-2019T17:56:27,TheOtherEric,Im not special
18-04-2019T17:56:36,TerraTheWizard,well what would be the closest country with a not-english language be?
18-04-2019T17:57:16,TheOtherEric,...idk central america area probably
18-04-2019T17:57:31,TerraTheWizard,so either spanish or portuguese
18-04-2019T17:57:55,TheOtherEric,I fail to see how thaat applies to pronouncing Keidran
18-04-2019T17:58:00,TerraTheWizard,well that flops my theory
18-04-2019T17:58:53,TheOtherEric,Lol so ultimatum? Anyone?
18-04-2019T17:59:16,TheOtherEric,"Its KY-drin, right?"
18-04-2019T18:00:34,Bgrmystr2,KY has a lot of different pronunciations
18-04-2019T18:00:40,Bgrmystr2,so that's not a legit question
18-04-2019T18:01:13,TheOtherEric,"Ky that rhymes with try, cry, and goodbye"
18-04-2019T18:01:15,Bgrmystr2,and I already said what it was. Tom told us a while back
18-04-2019T18:01:42,TheOtherEric,I missed the messages i said
18-04-2019T18:01:56,Bgrmystr2,then you must have ignored my reply to you stating that :P
18-04-2019T18:02:27,TheOtherEric,No but im on mobile and the message history is gone from that far

18-04-2019T18:04:03,Bgrmystr2,"so yeah, it would rhyme with cry or bye or try"
18-04-2019T18:04:12,TerraTheWizard,or pie

18-04-2019T20:35:36,Nekonny,No trip this year mihari
18-04-2019T20:35:42,Nekonny,thats not how it works though
18-04-2019T20:35:52,FloofyCat,(same question to anyone else too)
18-04-2019T20:36:00,LuckyMan,I'll make the first comment in Spanish
18-04-2019T20:36:12,Nekonny,"Ive been investing too much time in some projects, so commision income is 0"
18-04-2019T20:36:25,SageSaga,Tablet with screen feels more natural but you learn either way
18-04-2019T20:36:35,swack24,I'm still exhouasted from Moving across country from Georgia to Washington
18-04-2019T20:36:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,state?

18-04-2019T20:37:00,Nekonny,it's like learning to draw with your left hand
18-04-2019T20:37:02,Mihari,"It's fundamentally the same, you do whatever you do to build money to achieve whatever you aim to do, wether it's a 2K trip to Japan or a 2K tablet."

18-04-2019T20:41:37,Mippy,I’d rather rain and mud.
18-04-2019T20:41:44,Sclimshady,^
18-04-2019T20:41:46,FloofyCat,We have consistently mediocre weather and no extremes nor natural disasters like hurricanes?
18-04-2019T20:41:57,SpazztasticKiwi,In fact it just rained today and it’s a good thing too - my mud was gettin dehydrated
18-04-2019T20:42:14,MarvTheHugPharaoh,its raining right now

18-04-2019T20:42:44,Bgrmystr2,do not want
18-04-2019T20:42:47,FloofyCat,Until the one heatwave comes in the UK and almost every building is designed to trap in heat and AC doesn't exist outside of stores then it gets crappy.
18-04-2019T20:43:02,FloofyCat,But then again it's not like it's Houston so I can't complain
18-04-2019T20:43:14,Sclimshady,i have an irresistible urge to make rangoons so ill be back

18-04-2019T20:43:44,Mippy,"Well, Floofy, at least your winters are mild"
18-04-2019T20:43:45,FloofyCat,It hasn't for many many years.
18-04-2019T20:43:52,FloofyCat,It never even snows.
18-04-2019T20:44:19,Bgrmystr2,lol
18-04-2019T20:44:25,FloofyCat,"It only snows once a year in early February if you're lucky, even then it's like a few inches which shuts down half of all public transport somehow."

18-04-2019T20:49:43,Alphawolf333,48? that's kind of chilly... or maybe warm... or super cold. Depending on what scale we're on
18-04-2019T20:49:55,FloofyCat,8.9c = 48f
18-04-2019T20:49:59,Mippy,Not when you get literal Arctic Winters....10*C is damed nice
18-04-2019T20:50:02,Bgrmystr2,I was close

18-04-2019T20:50:16,Combak,45 F = 7 C
18-04-2019T20:50:45,FloofyCat,^ Dunno how you're getting that
18-04-2019T20:51:06,FloofyCat,But worst that happens in my area is usually -7c so that's good.
18-04-2019T20:51:17,Nekonny,I wonder if I could get the amount needed by selling that iMew book?
18-04-2019T20:51:17,Combak,Google
18-04-2019T20:51:22,unsteddyphoenix,t h i c c
18-04-2019T20:51:31,Nekonny,I didn't want to start anything untill Sage was done
18-04-2019T20:51:39,FloofyCat,Me too...
18-04-2019T20:51:57,Mippy,Mevby?
18-04-2019T20:52:13,SageSaga,im ordering the books in a week or so
18-04-2019T20:52:21,Mippy,:ctwokinds-karenOOO:
18-04-2019T20:53:18,RimaDraws,yay
18-04-2019T20:53:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Side question but does anyone else mix mustard and mayo for chicken nuggs
18-04-2019T20:53:28,RimaDraws,hopefully ill have the money
18-04-2019T20:53:36,McClaw,I just thought of a horrible pun for Flora to be pictured doing.
18-04-2019T20:53:50,Nekonny,So  when would be a good time sage?
18-04-2019T20:54:18,Bgrmystr2,"I don't like mustard, so no Kiwi"
18-04-2019T20:54:21,BadFoMo,@McClaw Care to share?
18-04-2019T20:54:29,SageSaga,it will take about a month for my books to come in- i'll start taking orders probably the weekend before they arrive
18-04-2019T20:54:41,RimaDraws,that will give me time to save up then
18-04-2019T20:54:47,Nekonny,I have about 40 copies on hand now
18-04-2019T20:54:49,Mippy,cool
18-04-2019T20:54:53,RimaDraws,how much?
18-04-2019T20:54:57,McClaw,"Draw Flora standing in the hatch of a Sherman or Abrams, proper gear optional. (There's an old gas station ad that goes, ""Put a tiger in your tank."")"
18-04-2019T20:55:35,SageSaga,the book will still be 30USD + Shipping
18-04-2019T20:56:02,SageSaga,it will cost more to print but i can still keep it at the same price- just wont make ask much money
18-04-2019T20:56:20,RimaDraws,ill have $40 ready then
18-04-2019T20:56:47,Mippy,Is crying because of international shipping and convertion rates....will still buy one
18-04-2019T20:57:01,McClaw,"Was that enough of a sinker, @BadFoMo?"
18-04-2019T20:57:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Here what may be a stupid question - would it be cheaper internationally if someone stateside ordered it then sent it to someone international
18-04-2019T20:58:02,Combak,No.
18-04-2019T20:58:07,SpazztasticKiwi,was that even understandable
18-04-2019T20:58:17,Combak,You're still sending it internationally.
18-04-2019T20:58:46,SageSaga,yeah that would just cost more
18-04-2019T20:59:01,BadFoMo,@McClaw I don't know? I've never really heard that phase before.
18-04-2019T20:59:05,SageSaga,for every international order i was losing money on the shipping i was charging
18-04-2019T20:59:06,Combak,"At the very least, it SHOULD."
18-04-2019T20:59:13,BadFoMo,*phrase
18-04-2019T20:59:19,BadFoMo,Sorry.
18-04-2019T20:59:22,Nekonny,That worked for me Kiwi
18-04-2019T20:59:25,SpazztasticKiwi,why mail is still so expensive is odd. We need teleportation already
18-04-2019T20:59:30,Nekonny,but only because of the amount of books I sent
18-04-2019T21:00:04,SpazztasticKiwi,What books you got?
18-04-2019T21:00:12,unsteddyphoenix,That steak is probably gonna be very rare
18-04-2019T21:00:16,SageSaga,Ron- you are giving a false equivalence
18-04-2019T21:00:46,SpazztasticKiwi,The rarest of steaks. It still has a “moo” left in it
18-04-2019T21:00:46,unsteddyphoenix,Cooked status: was next to an off grill for 30 seconds
18-04-2019T21:01:06,Nekonny,"sorry, let me clarify"
18-04-2019T21:01:20,Nekonny,When I did my Book KS
18-04-2019T21:01:34,Nekonny,I had about 25-30 european books
18-04-2019T21:01:42,Rooth,*peeks in*  HellO!
18-04-2019T21:01:50,Mippy,Yum! I love Moo!
18-04-2019T21:01:53,Nekonny,what I did was mail them all in a box to a friend of mine in germany
18-04-2019T21:01:58,Nekonny,and he resent them from there
18-04-2019T21:02:09,SpazztasticKiwi,You think Flora would try brautwursts
18-04-2019T21:02:11,McClaw,"@BadFoMo, it was a '60s ad campaign for Esso."
18-04-2019T21:02:12,Nekonny,saved about 2/3 of the cost of direct mail from the US
18-04-2019T21:02:19,SpazztasticKiwi,yes I know that misspelled
18-04-2019T21:02:31,BadFoMo,Flora: Hmm. ...Needs more ketchup.
18-04-2019T21:02:52,SpazztasticKiwi,“ketchup”
18-04-2019T21:03:11,McClaw,Katsup. :P
18-04-2019T21:03:15,BadFoMo,...What did I spell?
18-04-2019T21:03:16,Rooth,"@Twokinds -- I read  your entire comic last Saturday & Sunday, and bought your artbook.   It was so awesome to see the evolution of both story and art.   <3"
18-04-2019T21:03:18,McClaw,Catsup?
18-04-2019T21:03:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Katsup is Kay’s special brand of homemade steak sauce
18-04-2019T21:03:53,SpazztasticKiwi,kat’s
18-04-2019T21:04:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Judging by that face someone mentioned the 🥞
18-04-2019T21:04:48,Mippy,I thought Katsup was just a joke on the Simpsons
18-04-2019T21:05:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I guess it is

18-04-2019T21:54:34,Tharkis,"Thanos can snap his fingers and do anything, but he does the most booring thing ever and just kills people"
18-04-2019T21:54:48,unsteddyphoenix,Thats just what a posioner would say!
18-04-2019T21:54:50,Tharkis,"i mean, he could nsap his fingers and turn a whole planet into catgirl maids to cater to his every whim"
18-04-2019T21:55:00,Bralios,But I ate it too!
18-04-2019T21:55:22,ViciousBordem16,Is flora considered people because they reference keidran throughout the story
18-04-2019T21:55:26,SageSaga,Tharkis that would be terrifying
18-04-2019T21:55:34,Tharkis,"but the movies dont even go into /why/ he wants to kill half of everyone , the comic books at least gave him a reason, he was trying to woo death to be his bride.  Movies were... meh on the whole plot thing"
18-04-2019T21:55:59,Tharkis,"terrifying, but purrfect !"
18-04-2019T21:56:02,SageSaga,a planet made up of catgirls that you had to walk over everywhere you go- trillions of them dying being crushed by the others

18-04-2019T21:56:29,Tharkis,"that's not what i meant ! i meant allthe people on the planet, not hte planet itself !"
18-04-2019T21:56:32,Rooth,The movies framed his motives as an attempt to counter overpopulation causing self-destruction
18-04-2019T21:56:33,Tharkis,sobs
18-04-2019T21:56:35,FloofyCat,Reminds me of the planet of Imperial Guardsmen

18-04-2019T22:08:59,FloofyCat,"Watching Endgame from footage captured illegally by a video camera in a theatre feels like spoiling it and not watching it, best to see it in the big screen or blu ray"

18-04-2019T22:10:59,FloofyCat,Tbh the blu ray versions usually don't cost much more than dvd now.

18-04-2019T22:22:18,Mippy,"Ooops...that did not come out when I wanted it too. Sorry, Rima. Did not mean to implie you do not have a life"
18-04-2019T22:22:28,SageSaga,Far Cry 4 ends with you and your Step Dad going to save the region - thats cool
18-04-2019T22:22:38,RimaDraws,i mean i played it just don't have time to complete games with school and work

18-04-2019T22:22:58,Zakuru,"its like beauty and the beast, but in necklace form"
18-04-2019T22:23:06,ViciousBordem16,I thought I was a skull snake
18-04-2019T22:23:06,CrimsonHelsing,possibly a piece of a subtle flower
18-04-2019T22:23:39,Zakuru,idr if the necklace is actually magic. When trace gave it to flora there was a ... reaction?
18-04-2019T22:23:47,Mippy,"wow...:ctwokinds-zenshocked: Flora=beauty, Trace=beast"
18-04-2019T22:23:49,RimaDraws,mhmm

18-04-2019T22:25:44,SageSaga,The queen is Gaston
18-04-2019T22:25:46,thestooge2222,I think Nora would be Morsie

18-04-2019T22:26:58,RimaDraws,lol
18-04-2019T22:27:18,ViciousBordem16,My favorite is Anastasia which is now a Disney movie
18-04-2019T22:27:25,Sclimshady,or the black cauldron
18-04-2019T22:27:39,ViciousBordem16,Once upon a December
18-04-2019T22:27:46,RimaDraws,noo ana was never a disney princess to start
18-04-2019T22:27:51,RimaDraws,idc if disney owns fox
18-04-2019T22:27:55,ViciousBordem16,That’s what I said
18-04-2019T22:27:58,Mippy,Unpopular opinion....Anastasia was not that good
18-04-2019T22:28:12,Zakuru,in what way?
18-04-2019T22:28:15,RimaDraws,it could have been better
18-04-2019T22:28:25,Sclimshady,*gasps in Russian*
18-04-2019T22:28:32,ViciousBordem16,I liked it though even if Christopher Lloyd never fit the bill
18-04-2019T22:28:41,Zakuru,i've only seen it when i was small so i don't remember it well
18-04-2019T22:29:17,ViciousBordem16,Fantastic mr fox is a classic though
18-04-2019T22:29:18,SageSaga,"""Anastasia tried to add Magic to the story for no reason!"" ""Like Pocahontas did"""
18-04-2019T22:29:29,Zakuru,;w;
18-04-2019T22:29:33,Mippy,It wasn't a bad movie...it just wasn't great either.  It was kind of a mess .
18-04-2019T22:29:34,Zakuru,changing a grim tale
18-04-2019T22:29:35,thestooge2222,I liked anastasia
18-04-2019T22:29:46,ViciousBordem16,Anastasia was darker irl
18-04-2019T22:29:57,Zakuru,of course
18-04-2019T22:29:57,Sclimshady,so were all fairy tales
18-04-2019T22:30:04,ViciousBordem16,They found her body in 2007
18-04-2019T22:30:14,Zakuru,what is one fairy tale that was actually whimsical? :thinking:
18-04-2019T22:30:18,Combak,Who's body?
18-04-2019T22:30:29,ViciousBordem16,Anastasia
18-04-2019T22:30:30,thestooge2222,Anastasia's
18-04-2019T22:30:31,SageSaga,Pocahontas is based on Smut written about Native Americans
18-04-2019T22:30:43,RimaDraws,yea but anastasia was actually more farfetched than the actual story
18-04-2019T22:30:45,ViciousBordem16,Mulan is dark too though
18-04-2019T22:30:59,Zakuru,mulan was a beast irl
18-04-2019T22:31:02,unsteddyphoenix,mustve been good smut
18-04-2019T22:31:08,Mippy,"Yeah, but I'm judging the film on it's own merits. Not on the history it's loosly based on"
18-04-2019T22:31:25,SageSaga,Pocahontas is about a 40 year old lusting after a 12 year old native
18-04-2019T22:31:28,ViciousBordem16,They umm molested her until she committed suicide in the original story
18-04-2019T22:31:28,RimaDraws,yea but her story is dark. her father actually died before she could get home.
18-04-2019T22:31:36,thestooge2222,I think Adam Conover just made the smut thing up
18-04-2019T22:31:49,Zakuru,no she died on her way to england
18-04-2019T22:31:53,Zakuru,or something
18-04-2019T22:32:06,RimaDraws,pocahontas was actually 12. sad to say
18-04-2019T22:32:12,Zakuru,but you know them ye olde europeans :upside_down:
18-04-2019T22:32:20,RimaDraws,yea she died of disease
18-04-2019T22:32:22,Sclimshady,someone call the cops
18-04-2019T22:32:29,ViciousBordem16,Wreck it wraph 2 screwed up though
18-04-2019T22:32:37,RimaDraws,not really
18-04-2019T22:32:44,Mippy,Haven't seen it
18-04-2019T22:32:45,RimaDraws,i just rewatched it
18-04-2019T22:33:09,ViciousBordem16,Ok nvm
18-04-2019T22:33:30,Mippy,The first one was not my favourite. I was just really annoyed by Vanillapie
18-04-2019T22:33:31,SageSaga,"i live near Jamestown- where the story of Pocahontas takes place, our historians were very upset about the movie being made the way it was"
18-04-2019T22:33:48,thestooge2222,I'd assume so!
18-04-2019T22:33:58,RimaDraws,dont blame them sage. every disney princess is farfetched
18-04-2019T22:34:01,ViciousBordem16,But still  Anastasia is still the darkest fox/Disney movie to this day
18-04-2019T22:34:14,unsteddyphoenix,Um
18-04-2019T22:34:22,Mippy,Ummm....I'd argue not
18-04-2019T22:34:24,unsteddyphoenix,Im not sure she's 1.9m
18-04-2019T22:34:26,SageSaga,Rima- most arent based on real world people
18-04-2019T22:34:36,RimaDraws,i know that sage
18-04-2019T22:34:39,ViciousBordem16,Only 2 are

18-04-2019T22:34:56,SageSaga,So i can blame them
18-04-2019T22:35:03,RimaDraws,that was good vicious
18-04-2019T22:35:06,ViciousBordem16,Maybe depends idk
18-04-2019T22:35:13,Zakuru,"dang sage, you're actually pretty close"
18-04-2019T22:35:14,RimaDraws,i meant cant blame them for being mad sage....

18-04-2019T22:52:03,Sclimshady,i paid 1200 for my 77 and all ihad to do was tune the carbourator
18-04-2019T22:52:54,Snowdayzz,we can only keep our cars for 7 years
18-04-2019T22:53:06,Sclimshady,what? why?

18-04-2019T22:54:22,Zakuru,but why
18-04-2019T22:54:33,Combak,Compare the size and population density of Singapore and the US and it all makes sense.
18-04-2019T22:54:41,Snowdayzz,yeap
18-04-2019T22:54:43,Tharkis,"problem is, th way the laws were written they wre written by rich people, so the only people it makes it a hardship on are the poor and middle classes"

18-04-2019T23:56:37,Twokinds,She got mad at Natani because Natani was being rude and she felt unappreciated.
18-04-2019T23:56:52,Twokinds,She was sort of projecting the feelings she was getting from Eric onto Natani
18-04-2019T23:56:58,unsteddyphoenix,She WAS being rude!
