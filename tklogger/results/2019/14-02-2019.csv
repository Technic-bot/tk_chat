14-02-2019T11:35:12,Twokinds,Huh? I don't remember saying that.

14-02-2019T11:39:12,iliar,Have you solved this problem?
14-02-2019T11:39:22,Mippy,Good morning....going to turn in my painting projects for the first half of the year.
14-02-2019T11:40:03,Twokinds,"yes, I did managed to solve it."
14-02-2019T11:40:30,Twokinds,By giving up.
14-02-2019T11:40:35,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
14-02-2019T11:40:49,TerraTheWizard,i guess that works
14-02-2019T11:41:24,Mippy,Valid way to solve something
14-02-2019T11:44:54,iliar,Okay. I have a similar problem. And I decided to try Power-line adapter. I do not like to give advice if I have not tried it myself. So I decided to buy a kit and try it in work.
14-02-2019T11:50:28,Twokinds,Did it work?
14-02-2019T11:51:05,Azumachan,It usually works great
14-02-2019T11:51:08,iliar,I do not know yet. The courier will bring them only on Monday.
14-02-2019T11:51:28,Azumachan,unless your lines are old and messed up
14-02-2019T11:53:20,iliar,I feel there must be problems with them. Their characteristics are too good to be true. 1 Gbps through an ordinary electrical wire is too much. I think in reality the speed will be less.
14-02-2019T11:53:47,Azumachan,500 mg
14-02-2019T11:54:21,iliar,"But if the real speed is at least 100 Mbps, it will be an excellent result."
14-02-2019T11:54:28,Azumachan,350-500 depending on the outlet
14-02-2019T11:54:38,Twokinds,My house lines are old.
14-02-2019T11:54:42,Twokinds,They do not even have a ground.
14-02-2019T11:54:52,Azumachan,Ows
14-02-2019T11:55:01,Azumachan,That's bad
14-02-2019T11:58:00,iliar,"I want to try using this device to connect two houses. If this option will also work, then I think you will be have no problems too."
14-02-2019T12:02:19,iliar,About yesterday's sketch. I wonder who will win in the battle between Adelaide and Saitama.
14-02-2019T12:02:46,Twokinds,pff
14-02-2019T12:03:01,Twokinds,That's a bit of a leap XD
14-02-2019T12:03:41,Twokinds,"Adelaide is incredibly strong, but only compared to a normal person."

14-02-2019T16:49:07,Dadrobit,Back from the doctor for blood test results. My blood pressure is back to normal and I'm not a diabetic! \o/
14-02-2019T16:49:24,Dadrobit,"Though my Vitamin D is in the shitter, so that needs fixing."
14-02-2019T16:51:01,Twokinds,Congrats!
14-02-2019T16:51:26,Dadrobit,Thanks!
14-02-2019T16:52:32,Dadrobit,Wasn't too too worried since I'm in decent shape/have an okay diet. But it was worth checking out with a family history like mine.
14-02-2019T16:55:51,Bgrmystr2,"I have an appt monday for.. not the blood test, but for everything else."
14-02-2019T16:56:38,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I had to get the blood test done because of my ""everything else"" appointment scaring the doctor."
14-02-2019T16:56:52,Twokinds,I should really see a doctor for a check up
14-02-2019T16:56:54,Dadrobit,Blood pressure was something insane like 133/90.
14-02-2019T16:57:08,Dadrobit,Today was 122/63
14-02-2019T16:57:21,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno mine, haven't gone in a while."

14-02-2019T17:48:38,Azumachan,Mmmm Ginger tea
14-02-2019T17:48:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Tetanus and booster vaccines are even more important with the ‚Äúvaccines bad‚Äù movement that‚Äôs causing so many outbreaks
14-02-2019T17:51:07,Xexanoth,and with all the licks Kat and Natani are giving...who even knows what's getting spread there :P
14-02-2019T17:52:33,SpazztasticKiwi,But yea for not being sugar intolerant

14-02-2019T18:12:49,Dadrobit,"Ha, not by a mile. On PS4. It's plenty populated and there are a few really solid players I've come across, but there are so many people that are just bad at fps on a dualshock."

14-02-2019T18:15:20,Dadrobit,"Also, I'm currently one-tricking Caustic. And he's absolute dogshit in terms of unique abilities."
14-02-2019T18:15:54,Dadrobit,100% either you outplay with gungame or you're boned. Nothing in his kit really does anything effective.
14-02-2019T18:17:05,Dadrobit,"And xex, I'm way better in controller than KBM."

14-02-2019T21:44:48,Bgrmystr2,I would say decent product
14-02-2019T21:44:54,Bgrmystr2,their hardware isn't state of the art
14-02-2019T21:45:08,ShadowSoap,"It works for me, and I enjoy it."
14-02-2019T21:45:13,ShadowSoap,I just get older models.
14-02-2019T21:45:14,AFallingTree,"actually yeah scratch what i said before, apple products are amazing but apple as a company sucks"

14-02-2019T21:45:26,ShadowSoap,As new ones are WAY over priced
14-02-2019T21:45:30,SageSaga,Apple is only slightly better than Supreme in terms of what they provide
14-02-2019T21:45:31,AFallingTree,indeed

14-02-2019T21:46:47,AFallingTree,"true, as someone who repairs computers i find macs really frustrating"
14-02-2019T21:46:52,Ordithus,Not that some of my other devices are very repairable...

14-02-2019T21:47:32,LannAF,but 120$ is too much.

14-02-2019T21:48:55,SageSaga,I like my Pixel2 XL
14-02-2019T21:48:59,LannAF,but screen repair is expensive
14-02-2019T21:49:06,LannAF,It still works perfectly fine minus a giant crack
14-02-2019T21:49:07,ZephyrTWolffox,f*#@ data packages
14-02-2019T21:49:15,CrRAR,"I got that too sage, much good about it."

14-02-2019T21:59:52,Chalodraws,I spend in anime figures. and games I never play.
14-02-2019T21:59:59,Combak,At least it was always a discounted bundle though. XD

14-02-2019T23:12:27,DarthRexKing,Sounds like something from final fantasy. :V
14-02-2019T23:12:37,Ordithus,"It's from Bravely Default, so pretty close"
14-02-2019T23:12:51,Bgrmystr2,serpent attacks the ground or something
14-02-2019T23:12:53,DarthRexKing,Okay. Thanks. :V

14-02-2019T23:13:09,DarthRexKing,"Man, Bosses always have the best themes. :V"
14-02-2019T23:13:21,Ordithus,I would hope they would
14-02-2019T23:13:28,Bgrmystr2,"well yeah, they're bosses"
14-02-2019T23:13:29,DarthRexKing,. . . . . . . .So what would the boss theme be when Joy fights the final villain?
14-02-2019T23:13:38,CrRAR,they DEMAND it
14-02-2019T23:13:42,DarthRexKing,>W>
14-02-2019T23:13:49,Bgrmystr2,Serpent Eating the Ground
14-02-2019T23:14:01,Bgrmystr2,it's the theme for the final boss from Bravely Default
14-02-2019T23:14:04,RimaDraws,Feels good to sit after a long week
14-02-2019T23:14:04,DarthRexKing,.w. That had be some pretty damn good dirt.
14-02-2019T23:14:08,Bgrmystr2,yeah
14-02-2019T23:14:39,DarthRexKing,"Thanks. Sounds like for this boss, we need to bring BGR guns. . . . . . ."
14-02-2019T23:14:51,Bgrmystr2,"I am not a gun, sorry xD"
14-02-2019T23:14:56,DarthRexKing,>W>
14-02-2019T23:15:08,Bgrmystr2,"though if I was, I'd likely be too heavy to carry anyway."
14-02-2019T23:15:20,DarthRexKing,This part sounds like something from Naruto. XD
14-02-2019T23:15:31,CrRAR,or sim city lol

14-02-2019T23:22:13,Twokinds,This is one of my fav tracks
14-02-2019T23:22:27,DarthRexKing,"Hmm. This begs the question though. I cannot remember names, but the one being hugged, she is not as tall nor as physically strong as her mother. Who's side of the family did she take her genetics mostly from? <W<"
14-02-2019T23:22:34,CrRAR,it's like.... orchestral Tetris
14-02-2019T23:22:46,DarthRexKing,Let's play some Tetris mother fucker. :V
14-02-2019T23:22:54,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-nataniAAAAshake:
14-02-2019T23:22:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Hey lookie there. A good 5 rows of type type and you didn‚Äôt mess up
14-02-2019T23:23:12,DarthRexKing,Who did not mess up what? :V

14-02-2019T23:23:51,DarthRexKing,". . . . . .*Imagines Joy looking at the evil lady and thinks of her saying ""Let's play some Tetris mother fucker"", and proceeds to beat up bad guy with Tetris music playing.*"
14-02-2019T23:23:52,SpazztasticKiwi,And the moments gone
14-02-2019T23:24:02,CrRAR,:_:
14-02-2019T23:24:03,DarthRexKing,Cr messes up their sentences a lot?
14-02-2019T23:24:11,CrRAR,sometimes
14-02-2019T23:24:23,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúSometimes‚Äù
14-02-2019T23:24:30,CrRAR,no but it was all grouped together
14-02-2019T23:24:41,CrRAR,like a happy lil sonnet
14-02-2019T23:25:59,CrRAR,"the words, sometimes I can't control em"
14-02-2019T23:26:01,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-reniderp:

14-02-2019T23:29:41,Ordithus,From Kaylin? :ptv-ohmy:
14-02-2019T23:29:48,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I gave him my curse for the day
14-02-2019T23:29:48,Bgrmystr2,but then my computer decided to use all the ram it had and everything broke
14-02-2019T23:30:02,CrRAR,damn
14-02-2019T23:30:05,Sammit,"I have to go to sleep now, thanks for the streams Tom, Sage, Chalo and Ron, Bye everybody"

14-02-2019T23:33:29,CrRAR,aruuuu
14-02-2019T23:33:40,Ordithus,Or Lizard Golem makes a shortcut through the wall
14-02-2019T23:33:43,CrRAR,theer is some moonlight present
14-02-2019T23:33:53,CrRAR,tru
14-02-2019T23:34:13,CrRAR,well I guess that's daylight.
14-02-2019T23:34:53,CrRAR,Lizard Golem hopefully stays put in his little hallway
14-02-2019T23:34:58,CrRAR,like a good boy

14-02-2019T23:37:12,Ordithus,haha
14-02-2019T23:37:16,CrRAR,oh... dear
14-02-2019T23:37:23,Combak,takes a closer look at the dialogue on Sage's image
14-02-2019T23:37:26,Combak,lol
14-02-2019T23:37:34,CrRAR,DESTROYS? Or ENHANCES!?
14-02-2019T23:37:40,CrRAR,:thinking:
14-02-2019T23:37:58,ZRO4825,lmao
14-02-2019T23:38:02,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-wondering:
14-02-2019T23:38:20,BadFoMo,Roselyn: I guess I should let you out now; but I fell like I show the two of you what happens to naughty girls who wander into places they shouldn't go...
14-02-2019T23:38:29,BadFoMo,*feel
14-02-2019T23:39:45,Bgrmystr2,I feel like this isn't a punishment.. :ptv-wondering:
14-02-2019T23:40:34,Ordithus,"It will be, when Rose dons her Luchador mask"
14-02-2019T23:41:00,SageSaga,so i think i figured out what i love about most of the Far Cry games
14-02-2019T23:41:12,CrRAR,The distant locales!?
14-02-2019T23:41:15,SageSaga,and what i hate most about them
14-02-2019T23:41:21,BadFoMo,Or has full axess to the mansion.
14-02-2019T23:41:28,Bgrmystr2,lol Ord.. I wouldn't be worried if it was Rose.
14-02-2019T23:41:29,CrRAR,The generic narritive!?
14-02-2019T23:41:30,SageSaga,lots of people joke about how its Skyrim with guns
14-02-2019T23:41:32,Bgrmystr2,The King on the other hand..
14-02-2019T23:41:39,SageSaga,but it's really a lot more polished for one thing
14-02-2019T23:42:16,CrRAR,mmm
14-02-2019T23:42:58,SageSaga,the game play is very solid even when its repetitive - and the story overall is probably more interesting than most of the Elder Scroll games
14-02-2019T23:43:26,SageSaga,what i absolutely hate about it though is how they give you SO MUCH CONTROL- only to rip it from you in the worse ways possible
14-02-2019T23:44:00,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
14-02-2019T23:44:01,CrRAR,Bethesda was always just good at broad strokes and themes. Never really detail.
14-02-2019T23:44:14,BadFoMo,How so? I've never erall played Far Cry.
14-02-2019T23:44:30,Combak,How so Sage?
14-02-2019T23:44:32,BadFoMo,*really
14-02-2019T23:44:33,SageSaga,in Far Cry 5 i think it might be the worse at doing this
14-02-2019T23:44:45,SageSaga,but 3 and 4 did  it too
14-02-2019T23:45:12,SageSaga,"but for example- in 5 you eventually get ""hunted"" and one version it seems like you might have a chance to fight them off- but you dont"
14-02-2019T23:45:37,SageSaga,"its like ""You are being hunted!"" and a cutscene forces you to be captured- this happens MANY TIMES"
14-02-2019T23:45:51,SageSaga,it railroads you HARD
14-02-2019T23:45:52,BadFoMo,I hate that.
14-02-2019T23:46:10,SageSaga,its normal when its like a linear story line
14-02-2019T23:46:16,BadFoMo,The same thing happens in Fallout 3: The Pitt.
14-02-2019T23:46:43,SageSaga,but you are so free in everything you usually do in Far Cry- and then BAM! like a train falling from the sky you are railroaded into the ground
14-02-2019T23:46:47,BadFoMo,"...If you kill the guards right outside the gate, that is."
14-02-2019T23:47:28,CrRAR,emphasizes your vulnerability~
14-02-2019T23:47:39,CrRAR,supposed to make you feel merely human~
14-02-2019T23:47:43,Combak,"Oh yeah, I've heard complaints about that before."
14-02-2019T23:48:07,SageSaga,then the boss fights-
14-02-2019T23:49:03,SageSaga,"""In order to make it not just a fight of killing the bad guy- lets like make you super high on drugs! Then we can have the boss shoot fire balls and fly for no reason!"""
14-02-2019T23:49:18,BadFoMo,UniKitty: ...WTF did I just see?
14-02-2019T23:49:32,CrRAR,:pill::pill:
14-02-2019T23:49:46,Combak,Yeah...
14-02-2019T23:50:13,SageSaga,i'd rather fight waves and waves of bad guys and then have the boss come out in like a tank or some power armor stuff or something
14-02-2019T23:50:14,Combak,"To be fair, having a reasonable boss fight in realistic scenarios is pretty hard."
14-02-2019T23:50:31,Combak,There's only so many options.
14-02-2019T23:50:43,LannAF,Tom
14-02-2019T23:51:00,SageSaga,"im fine with them just making it so the ""bosses"" are never found until a cetain point and you need to hunt them down and kill em like any other character in the game"
14-02-2019T23:51:22,LannAF,vaelor said you need to be our 3rd for Apex
14-02-2019T23:51:43,LannAF,And that you can totally just say you're drawing the game REALLY fast.
14-02-2019T23:52:23,BadFoMo,@Nekonny I like this animation.
14-02-2019T23:52:30,SageSaga,heck- have em come after you with an army of bear cavalry or something
14-02-2019T23:52:34,LannAF,"also, I miss back when the Far Cry games were more...Well, normal."
14-02-2019T23:53:09,LannAF,The healing animations were cathartic
14-02-2019T23:54:08,CharismaStreaming,@Nekonny Can you do an animation of https://www.deviantart.com/suicidesquadarchives/art/Atori-Wanderer-Of-The-Galaxy-now-in-full-color-768528068 pole-dancing his butt around?
14-02-2019T23:54:28,Nekonny,this looks ok?
14-02-2019T23:54:46,CharismaStreaming,"yeah, it does"
