08-05-2019T01:10:44,Bgrmystr2,"I hope so by now, but he should be sleeping by now xD"
08-05-2019T01:10:55,Bgrmystr2,"or, would be, I presume.. since it's past 2am"
08-05-2019T01:28:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I wonder if he has a limit where he actually goes to sleep anymore. Seen him up at odd hours before
08-05-2019T01:29:01,Bgrmystr2,yeah same

08-05-2019T16:34:59,TerraTheWizard,"no need, i know the reference"
08-05-2019T16:35:12,CrimsonQuill,Someone made a Hetalia version
08-05-2019T16:35:34,CrimsonQuill,It was the first version I saw.
08-05-2019T16:35:41,CrimsonQuill,I laughed my arse off.

08-05-2019T16:47:09,SpazztasticKiwi,I realize he got that title from my suggestion itself
08-05-2019T16:47:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Which fits. I find ‚Äúthe spark never dies‚Äù funnier
08-05-2019T16:48:23,SpazztasticKiwi,but ah. I was still working when he swung in for ideas
08-05-2019T16:49:05,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, unfortunate"

08-05-2019T16:50:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Scare the water off him
08-05-2019T16:50:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Like the Tom and jerry cartoons when Tom would loose his fur after his tail got slammed in the door
08-05-2019T16:51:37,Bgrmystr2,haha
08-05-2019T16:51:40,Bgrmystr2,maybe
08-05-2019T16:52:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Trace puffs out a lil smoke ring at the end
08-05-2019T16:57:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh you know at the carnival those days ago I saw two guys get in the scrambler and then spend the whole ride trying not to touch
08-05-2019T16:57:34,SpazztasticKiwi,How close are you two? You‚Äôre about to be closer
08-05-2019T16:59:53,Bgrmystr2,"lol, trying so hard not to be gay"
08-05-2019T17:00:03,Bgrmystr2,when touching doesn't equal gay xD
08-05-2019T17:01:18,CrimsonQuill,"Wait, what's a scrambler?"
08-05-2019T17:01:43,CrimsonQuill,Is it some sort of Ferris wheel?
08-05-2019T17:01:49,CrimsonQuill,Or a roundabout?
08-05-2019T17:04:24,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:

08-05-2019T17:13:17,CrimsonQuill,"Oh, my Mum's been on one of those."
08-05-2019T17:13:28,CrimsonQuill,I heard screaming. :ptv-laugh:
08-05-2019T17:13:53,Bgrmystr2,it's mostly cuz the arms spin and the set of seats that are on each arm all spin too]
08-05-2019T17:14:02,CrimsonQuill,I see
08-05-2019T17:14:04,Bgrmystr2,cuz they're on the same structure
08-05-2019T17:14:38,Bgrmystr2,it's kind of like how the moon rotates on it's axis while spinning around the earth
08-05-2019T17:15:01,Bgrmystr2,only there's a bunch of seats instead of standing on the moon lol
08-05-2019T17:15:17,Bgrmystr2,it's not that bad
08-05-2019T17:15:41,CrimsonQuill,My mum doesn't like spinny rides and rollercoadsters.
08-05-2019T17:15:43,Bgrmystr2,"the crazy ones can actually lift the main structure vertical off the ground, or partially off"
08-05-2019T17:16:07,Bgrmystr2,"and the seats end up being open rotation, so they can spin upsidedown and stuff"
08-05-2019T17:16:15,Bgrmystr2,"I've seen it like.. once, nope.jpg"
08-05-2019T17:16:37,CrimsonQuill,That was the one my mum was on.
08-05-2019T17:16:41,CrimsonQuill,In Parc Asterix
08-05-2019T17:16:44,Bgrmystr2,your mom probably has motion sickness of some type
08-05-2019T17:16:58,CrimsonQuill,"No, she just is terrified of them."
08-05-2019T17:17:00,CrimsonQuill,That's all.
08-05-2019T17:17:28,Bgrmystr2,yeah that's kind of what causes being terrified of them :P
08-05-2019T17:17:58,CrimsonQuill,I've never been on one of them or a rollercoaster...
08-05-2019T17:18:18,CrimsonQuill,But I have been 75 m underground to see the 3rd biggest stalactite in the world.
08-05-2019T17:18:29,CrimsonQuill,And 350m underground to see a mining survey in action.
08-05-2019T17:19:13,Bgrmystr2,"I've gone on a couple of coasters before, my favorite was still the Mega Zeph that used to be in the Six Flags park near Orleans"
08-05-2019T17:19:30,Bgrmystr2,it was a wooden coaster but with metal supports
08-05-2019T17:19:56,CrimsonQuill,Have you ever seen a 3d laser scanner in action/
08-05-2019T17:19:58,CrimsonQuill,?
08-05-2019T17:20:09,CrimsonQuill,"As in a surveying one, not the printer."
08-05-2019T17:20:21,Bgrmystr2,I wouldn't know?
08-05-2019T17:21:06,CrimsonQuill,I saw one in action...
08-05-2019T17:21:19,CrimsonQuill,The stuff that can be extracted is really cool.
08-05-2019T17:21:44,CrimsonQuill,"On the other hand, actually sorting through the point cloud data is a pain in the arse."
08-05-2019T17:22:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I only get on rides that stay on the ground
08-05-2019T17:22:07,CrimsonQuill,"Oh, and I only have tomorrow to finish that project thing...which I am barely at the start at."
08-05-2019T17:22:18,SpazztasticKiwi,No farris wheels
08-05-2019T17:22:47,Bgrmystr2,"those are cool, Kiwi, but only if the view is actually worth going up to see"
08-05-2019T17:22:53,SpazztasticKiwi,And I missed everything 16:57-17:01
08-05-2019T17:22:59,CrimsonQuill,"The Spinnaker tower in Portsmout has a glass floor on it's lowest ""deck"", aboyt 80-100 m above."
08-05-2019T17:23:43,Bgrmystr2,"oh, lol kiwi I said ppl trying not to touch, and touching doesn't equal gay"
08-05-2019T17:24:02,SpazztasticKiwi,pharaohs fury is ok. But I don‚Äôt much like that one anymore
08-05-2019T17:24:27,SpazztasticKiwi,I know. It was like theyd never rode before and didn‚Äôt know they‚Äôd potentially crush each other
08-05-2019T17:24:38,Bgrmystr2,haha
08-05-2019T17:24:41,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs what I‚Äôve noticed a few people don‚Äôt get warned about
08-05-2019T17:24:51,Bgrmystr2,that's the fun of rides tho
08-05-2019T17:24:59,Bgrmystr2,tis the whole point
08-05-2019T17:25:58,SpazztasticKiwi,"They order you smallest on the outside, biggest on the inside so the momentum won‚Äôt put boyfriend where he‚Äôs smothering the girlfriend but when just a group of friends gets on.."
08-05-2019T17:26:32,SpazztasticKiwi,They don‚Äôt necessarily know they‚Äôre going to be pressed against the outer side of the pod
08-05-2019T17:26:56,Bgrmystr2,yeah lol
08-05-2019T17:27:16,Bgrmystr2,but that's also part of the experience.
08-05-2019T17:27:21,Bgrmystr2,actually WATCHING the damn ride
08-05-2019T17:27:24,Bgrmystr2,to see what it does
08-05-2019T17:27:26,SpazztasticKiwi,I like riding the thing alone. Mainly because that and I don‚Äôt have someone to go with half the time cause schedules
08-05-2019T17:28:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Getting in is easier than getting out cause it‚Äôs ~just~ high enough that my feet don‚Äôt touch the ground when climbing out
08-05-2019T17:28:34,Bgrmystr2,"I'd go, but I have some kind of severe allergic reaction to theme parks since 80% (not exaggerating) of the time I've ended up in the hospital"
08-05-2019T17:28:54,SpazztasticKiwi,prejudice towards short people
08-05-2019T17:28:57,Bgrmystr2,"like, legit 8/10 odds"

08-05-2019T17:29:31,Bgrmystr2,haha
08-05-2019T17:29:43,Bgrmystr2,that would actually be nice
08-05-2019T17:29:50,CrimsonQuill,"It's like a Temmie getting ""HOIVS!"""
08-05-2019T17:30:14,Bgrmystr2,my problem is my body doesn't make enough electrolites naturally to keep up with being in a theme park or convention or whatnot
08-05-2019T17:30:42,CrimsonQuill,My problem is I keep staying up till after midnight when I should be sleeping.
08-05-2019T17:30:47,CrimsonQuill,It's 11:20pm...
08-05-2019T17:30:51,CrimsonQuill,Dammit I am stupid.
08-05-2019T17:30:53,Bgrmystr2,so I've had so many moments in the hospital with severe dehydration because drinking water isn't actually enough
08-05-2019T17:30:55,SpazztasticKiwi,what‚Äôs generally the difference between theme parks carnivals and fairs besides the ‚Äúcan‚Äôt be picked up and moved‚Äù thing
08-05-2019T17:31:19,SpazztasticKiwi,ever heard of gateraide
08-05-2019T17:31:27,Bgrmystr2,"yes, I know of that"
08-05-2019T17:32:04,Bgrmystr2,"that's what the hospitals recommended to me, any kind of gaterade, powerade, etc, anything that gives you more electrolites than normal water would, but is otherwise unchanged"
08-05-2019T17:32:50,Bgrmystr2,"I knew of it before they did, but yknow"
08-05-2019T17:32:56,SpazztasticKiwi,try it. And you‚Äôre not supposed to guzzle it. Sip. And often times they recommend watering it down for more liquid
08-05-2019T17:33:15,Bgrmystr2,you say that as if I don't drink it regularly when going to conventions and parks and stuff lol :P
08-05-2019T17:33:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I notice I get points where my potassium and iron starts telling me ‚Äúlow fuel‚Äù
08-05-2019T17:33:57,SpazztasticKiwi,body cramps when there‚Äôs no logical reason are bull
08-05-2019T17:34:24,SpazztasticKiwi,gateraide and I‚Äôm ok a bit later
08-05-2019T17:35:11,Bgrmystr2,"I don't, usually. Which is the problem. I get tired like everyone else, but it just ends up getting worse and worse, I don't feel better as the day goes on"
08-05-2019T17:35:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Though I‚Äôm more for poweraide
08-05-2019T17:35:22,Bgrmystr2,"while everyone else gets enough energy from resting, I get none."
08-05-2019T17:35:46,Bgrmystr2,"by the time I notice something is wrong, it's already too late."
08-05-2019T17:39:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"On a completely unrelated note, I‚Äôve been thinking about the house more. How it comes with all the furniture, and that includes the family pictures from the family it was foreclosed on"
08-05-2019T17:41:20,Bgrmystr2,can sell it all and make some dosh
08-05-2019T17:41:58,Bgrmystr2,foreclosed houses are good
08-05-2019T17:42:12,Bgrmystr2,"they can be, aren't always"
08-05-2019T17:42:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Who‚Äôs gonna want the pictures of a family no one knows
08-05-2019T17:42:52,SpazztasticKiwi,The frames maybe
08-05-2019T17:43:00,Bgrmystr2,yeah that's not what I'm talkin about
08-05-2019T17:43:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Yes I know the point
08-05-2019T17:43:48,SpazztasticKiwi,We aim to sell junk anyway. Especially the ceramic cake centerpiece for the dining table

08-05-2019T21:53:07,CrRAR,Grand canyooooonnnneroooo?
08-05-2019T21:53:16,Ordithus,Londoooooon Bridge
08-05-2019T21:53:24,Ordithus,Havasu City
08-05-2019T21:53:33,CrRAR,"Careful, might fall down"
08-05-2019T21:54:25,CrRAR,This is quite an ambitious itinerary.
08-05-2019T21:55:04,Ordithus,They moved the bridge
08-05-2019T21:55:13,CrRAR,oh... good
08-05-2019T21:55:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt know what bit me but apparently I‚Äôm delicious
08-05-2019T21:55:46,CrRAR,careful it might come back for seconds. :eyes:
08-05-2019T21:55:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Dots on my arm ankle and shoulder
08-05-2019T21:56:02,Ordithus,:csagesaga-nynasmirk::fork_and_knife:
08-05-2019T21:56:25,CrRAR,maybe just a very nervous mosquito.
08-05-2019T21:56:44,Dadrobit,Lake Havasu City. Can't say I've been.
08-05-2019T21:57:17,CrRAR,"""G-gonna get squashed. *bzrrrt* Gonna GET squashed... *bzzz* Gonna get SQUASHED!"""
08-05-2019T21:57:38,CrRAR,*gets squashed*
08-05-2019T21:59:44,CrRAR,That is quite a pretty bridge.
08-05-2019T21:59:50,SpazztasticKiwi,I feel Bagheera‚Äôs gettin fat
08-05-2019T22:00:02,CrRAR,I can't believe they moved it to Arizona. xD
08-05-2019T22:00:23,CrRAR,tubby... tiger?
08-05-2019T22:00:25,Ordithus,Yeah!  It's crazy.  I'm looking forward to seeing it
08-05-2019T22:00:31,Dadrobit,"Yeah, because AZ is s known for its bodies of water."
08-05-2019T22:01:11,SpazztasticKiwi,As water bound as Japan
08-05-2019T22:01:40,Dadrobit,"For real though, it does kinda put an asterisk on the old ""I have a bridge to sell you"" gag."
08-05-2019T22:03:16,CrRAR,^

08-05-2019T22:04:39,CrRAR,One guy with a dream set out... to prove THEM wrong.
08-05-2019T22:05:05,Dadrobit,"Also, I've starterd working again... Not TECHNICALLY a security officer, right now I'm an ""acting security supervisor""."
08-05-2019T22:05:21,Ordithus,Congrats?
08-05-2019T22:05:25,CrRAR,employment \o/
08-05-2019T22:05:43,Dadrobit,"Since DPS hasn't yet gotten me my liscense, but my old post wanted me back asap."
08-05-2019T22:06:06,Dadrobit,"So I look like a duck, I quack like a duck, but I'm actually a supervisor."
08-05-2019T22:06:22,Ordithus,"Duck, duck, fully operational battle station"
08-05-2019T22:07:31,Dadrobit,Working in a different gate house right now just next to my old one. S'pretty nice. Has super tall cielings and a chandelier in the foyer.
08-05-2019T22:07:46,Dadrobit,ceilings
08-05-2019T22:08:09,Dadrobit,These folks got money to burn for sure.
08-05-2019T22:10:22,Dadrobit,"Alas, T Mobile sucks balls and I get next to zero service up there. Ten bucks says even the ""Emergency Calls Only"" service I get doesn't even work either."
08-05-2019T22:23:44,CrRAR,"Yeah I have Google's Fi service which mixes a few carriers, including TMobile. Data strength is pretty good in general but call quality is spotty. They did just put up a tower right next to my work so it's been great there since. xD"
08-05-2019T22:25:27,Dadrobit,I'm thinking some of my earliest paychecks are going to be invested into getting back into Verizon.
08-05-2019T22:26:01,Dadrobit,I'm paying for unlimited everything with T Mobile and I feel lucky when I get even two bars at home. That's just not okay
08-05-2019T22:27:22,CrRAR,Yeah I'm surprised at how far the smaller carriers have come that they still pale in compassion to the big ones.
08-05-2019T22:28:23,CrRAR,Kinda shows it does take a TON of investment and time to build a reliable/quality network.
08-05-2019T22:29:01,CrRAR,...all to send receive our precious emoji pictures.

08-05-2019T22:30:21,Dadrobit,"Had Verizon. Brother is military and T Mobile promised ""The exact same experience for half the price!"" with a family military discount plan."
08-05-2019T22:30:50,Dadrobit,More like 75% the price and 10% of the exeperience.
08-05-2019T22:30:58,Dadrobit,experience
08-05-2019T22:31:31,Dadrobit,"Ah well, time for me to get quacking."
08-05-2019T22:31:47,CrRAR,Alrighty
08-05-2019T22:31:52,Dadrobit,I'll just bring my 3DS for some funsies while I'm there instead.
08-05-2019T22:32:01,Dadrobit,Have a good one y'all.
08-05-2019T22:32:04,CrRAR,Solid plan
08-05-2019T22:32:09,SpazztasticKiwi,So you‚Äôre literally a goose. Look like duck. Quack like duck. Act like goose
08-05-2019T22:32:17,CrRAR,Have a good one~
08-05-2019T22:32:18,Ordithus,bye robit
08-05-2019T22:33:08,Dadrobit,"I can confirm that occasionally I've gotten goosed by a few folks while I'm there, but that's all I'll say on that matter."
08-05-2019T22:33:09,Dadrobit,o7
08-05-2019T22:33:26,SpazztasticKiwi,How is security work
08-05-2019T22:33:45,SpazztasticKiwi,There‚Äôs an option for me around here for prison security
08-05-2019T22:33:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Watching cameras pointing in another room
08-05-2019T22:34:05,Dadrobit,"For me, easy as shit."
08-05-2019T22:34:07,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm slightly tempted
08-05-2019T22:34:49,SpazztasticKiwi,But. There‚Äôs the thing of maybe eventually going nuts just doing basically nothing
08-05-2019T22:35:03,Dadrobit,I wouldn't touch a prison though myself. Aunt had a bad experience working at Rikers where she got her jaw broken by an inmate like 15 years ago and she's still fighting legal for compensation.
08-05-2019T22:35:42,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm to be in a separate room. Locked behind a gate with a panic button for the actual muscle if need be
08-05-2019T22:35:52,SpazztasticKiwi,From what I got from it anyway
08-05-2019T22:35:56,Dadrobit,"Anywho, this is me leaving for real now."
08-05-2019T22:36:08,SpazztasticKiwi,K. Knock yourself out
08-05-2019T22:36:12,Dadrobit,Be back in 10-ish
08-05-2019T22:47:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Have fun at school
08-05-2019T23:51:22,SpazztasticKiwi,I shouldn‚Äôt be laughing at a gymnastics fail compilation but the commentary has me in pain
