19-02-2019T01:22:11,PotatoRights,Why do you think i support potato rights?
19-02-2019T01:22:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Because their existence could’ve prevented the famine?

19-02-2019T16:38:08,Twokinds,Huh I never noticed I misspelled clothes on that previous sketch
19-02-2019T16:38:14,Twokinds,Someone pointed it out just today
19-02-2019T16:43:18,Bgrmystr2,the one with Kat streaking? It's spelled right on the screencaps I have.
19-02-2019T16:45:40,ThingsAreMoving,It was spelled right when the text was over Eric's head. You must've lost a letter while rearranging the text bubbles.

19-02-2019T16:49:49,TerraTheWizard,by chance i ended up running into that christmas page again today
19-02-2019T16:50:05,TerraTheWizard,http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/20141221/
19-02-2019T16:50:29,TerraTheWizard,we were talking about that time zen called keith cute by accident
19-02-2019T16:50:43,TerraTheWizard,"and i went to find the page, this is what you get when you hit previous"
19-02-2019T16:52:02,Twokinds,oh yeah there are fillers in the archive that don't show up in the archive page
19-02-2019T16:53:03,TerraTheWizard,"oh, for some reason page 1051 has a smaller preview in the archive than the other pages"
19-02-2019T16:54:55,TerraTheWizard,38x50 instead of 50x65
19-02-2019T16:58:59,ThingsAreMoving,smoler preview for the faint of heart
19-02-2019T17:17:32,TerraTheWizard,"ok, gonna ask my silly question here :ctwokinds-NoraEyebrows:"
19-02-2019T17:18:37,TerraTheWizard,"You've been cursed and you're becoming a character from the comic, but you can chose who you become"
19-02-2019T17:18:39,TerraTheWizard,"excluding Nora & the masks, who do you chose?"
19-02-2019T17:19:17,TerraTheWizard,chose? choose?
19-02-2019T17:21:55,TerraTheWizard,"i couldn't decide between mike & sealeen so had to flip a coin, so i'm sealeen now i guess"
19-02-2019T17:25:02,TerraTheWizard,i guess tom could just pick himself :ctwokinds-floraquestion:
19-02-2019T17:25:25,ThingsAreMoving,I'd say either Eric or Trace. Basically the more bling the better.
19-02-2019T17:26:48,ThingsAreMoving,"wait, do we go into the comic world, or just transform into some character from the comic but still live in our universe?"
19-02-2019T17:27:06,TerraTheWizard,this is what i forgot to specify when i originally asked it
19-02-2019T17:27:17,TerraTheWizard,people assumed the former
19-02-2019T17:27:26,Bgrmystr2,"choose, terra"
19-02-2019T17:27:29,Bgrmystr2,chose is past tense
19-02-2019T17:27:31,TerraTheWizard,i was thinking the latter
19-02-2019T17:27:34,Bgrmystr2,"and honestly, I dunno"
19-02-2019T17:28:42,Bgrmystr2,"I think I'd go with Karen or Maren honestly. If I had to BE one of them, honestly they seem like the best bet. Everyone else seems to get into dangerous situations and being the character, you don't know if you're gonna get out alive or what the story"
19-02-2019T17:29:37,Bgrmystr2,"they have fairly boring, but safe lives being in the tavern"
19-02-2019T17:29:48,ThingsAreMoving,"If we go into the comic world after we transform then again, Eric or Trace. Kei is an option too, but only because it would make courting a certain dragoness easier."
19-02-2019T17:30:13,Bgrmystr2,Eric would be a good choice too.
19-02-2019T17:30:21,TerraTheWizard,lol things
19-02-2019T17:30:23,ThingsAreMoving,If we'd transform and stay in this world then most likely Trace.
19-02-2019T17:30:30,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno bout trace, he's got that whole evil past thing"
19-02-2019T17:30:41,Bgrmystr2,plus the whole everyone wants to capture you or kill you.. or both
19-02-2019T17:30:47,ThingsAreMoving,"Idc, it wouldn't be him anymore"
19-02-2019T17:30:54,ThingsAreMoving,It'd be me transformed into him
19-02-2019T17:30:57,Bgrmystr2,yeah it would cuz you'd become him. xD
19-02-2019T17:31:08,Bgrmystr2,"so for all intents and purposes, to anyone else, you would be trace"
19-02-2019T17:31:25,Bgrmystr2,"just cuz you're different on the inside, noone else could see that cept maybe nora."
19-02-2019T17:31:28,Bgrmystr2,or Reni
19-02-2019T17:31:55,ThingsAreMoving,there's a lot of assumptions here
19-02-2019T17:33:39,Bgrmystr2,"Not really. That's a given for ""becoming a character"""
19-02-2019T17:33:45,Bgrmystr2,you're not taking their place
19-02-2019T17:33:50,Bgrmystr2,or replacing them.
19-02-2019T17:33:57,Bgrmystr2,you are becoming them. They are not becoming you. xD
19-02-2019T17:34:20,ThingsAreMoving,doesn't mean I loose my memories
19-02-2019T17:34:49,Bgrmystr2,"of course, but noone else would know that"
19-02-2019T17:35:07,Bgrmystr2,what you are privy to does not change the actions of others
19-02-2019T17:36:08,ThingsAreMoving,"Well, on the other hand If I became a comic character , my actions and the actions of those around me are determined by someone else."
19-02-2019T17:40:40,Bgrmystr2,"It's kind of the same setup trace has in the story. To him, he was himself in someone else's body. People are still after him, trying to kill him or capture him"
19-02-2019T17:41:11,Bgrmystr2,"he's not the old trace, but that doesn't stop everyone else from acting on what the old trace did."
19-02-2019T17:42:14,Bgrmystr2,I feel picking a relatively safe character would be the best route.
19-02-2019T17:43:45,ThingsAreMoving,"Trace as a main character has some plot armor. Might not shield him from everything, but considering the stuff he went through I'd say he's a safe bet."
19-02-2019T17:44:23,ThingsAreMoving,"Also, lots of money, magic and knowledge."
19-02-2019T17:45:40,Bgrmystr2,"I think plot armor is pretty bs, so I wouldn't rely on it. His money, magic, and knowledge are all absolutely things you could use to your advantage though."
19-02-2019T17:47:07,ThingsAreMoving,As long as he's one of the main characters he's safe. Unless Tom sells the rights to G. R.R. Martin
19-02-2019T17:47:29,ThingsAreMoving,then no character would be safe. ever
19-02-2019T17:47:59,Bgrmystr2,"You seem to be under the assumption that main characters are immune to death, and that's just not the case."
19-02-2019T17:49:17,ThingsAreMoving,That seems to be the case in most stories though.
19-02-2019T17:50:18,Bgrmystr2,"Rely on that on your own peril. I've seen too damn many stoires where the main character is like ""I'm the main character, I can't die!"" and then they get ded'd."
19-02-2019T17:50:50,Bgrmystr2,"it's so common, I wouldn't touch it."
19-02-2019T17:52:25,Bgrmystr2,"The worst case of ""Do you know who I am?!"""
19-02-2019T17:52:38,ThingsAreMoving,"It happens, but not as often as you picture it. If some stories involve killing off a main character in a way that adds to the story or allows some other characters to grow then I'm all for it."
19-02-2019T17:53:25,Bgrmystr2,"if you are that character, you wouldn't be all for it, now would you? :P"
19-02-2019T17:53:40,ThingsAreMoving,"Well, no."
19-02-2019T17:53:45,Bgrmystr2,and there ya go
19-02-2019T17:54:01,ThingsAreMoving,"But still, being the main character is safer than being one from the sidelines"
19-02-2019T17:54:09,ThingsAreMoving,imho
19-02-2019T17:54:43,Bgrmystr2,"From everything I've seen, I'd highly disagree. The only time you're guaranteed not safe on the sidelines is if you're wearing a red shirt."
19-02-2019T17:55:03,ThingsAreMoving,Or no shirt at all like musclehead general.
19-02-2019T17:55:08,Bgrmystr2,"Maren, Karen, Eric, they're not main characters, but they're not redshirts."
19-02-2019T17:55:22,Bgrmystr2,they're 2ndary characters that have importance to the story
19-02-2019T17:55:29,ThingsAreMoving,"or wearing full body armor with a helmet, but you dare to talk back to alabaster"
19-02-2019T17:55:47,Bgrmystr2,lol yeah they were pretty redshirt
19-02-2019T17:55:54,Bgrmystr2,".. even though, yknow.."
19-02-2019T17:57:21,ThingsAreMoving,"oh, redshirt character is a phrase."
19-02-2019T17:57:36,Bgrmystr2,..yes
19-02-2019T17:57:38,ThingsAreMoving,knowledge acquired
19-02-2019T17:57:43,Bgrmystr2,did you not know that?
19-02-2019T17:57:52,ThingsAreMoving,nope
19-02-2019T17:57:57,Bgrmystr2,well that explains a lot xD
19-02-2019T17:58:22,ThingsAreMoving,you seem to forget that english isn't my native language
19-02-2019T17:58:38,Bgrmystr2,yeah I'm sayin I wouldn't want to be main character in the heaps of danger unless the pros completely outweigh the cons.. and trace is not there yet imo
19-02-2019T17:58:48,ThingsAreMoving,I still remember the confusion when I told ya guys I didn't know the meaning of the word 'elope'
19-02-2019T17:58:51,Bgrmystr2,but I wouldn't be a redshirt side character either
19-02-2019T17:59:09,Bgrmystr2,"lol THings, I legit sometimes don't even remember you don't speak english primarily"
19-02-2019T17:59:19,ThingsAreMoving,So... Eric would be our best bet?
19-02-2019T17:59:28,Bgrmystr2,but honestly it's better than some ppl I speak to and they live here in the US and don't speak any other language
19-02-2019T17:59:58,Bgrmystr2,yeah I think eric would be pretty solid.
19-02-2019T18:00:35,Bgrmystr2,"Since Maren and Karen did the tavern for a bit and had very little in the way of interaction with dramatic scenes or whatnot, the story doesn't focus on them enough to kill them off."
19-02-2019T18:00:48,Bgrmystr2,but focuses on them JUST enough to make them not work keeping alive..
19-02-2019T18:00:51,ThingsAreMoving,Thank you for the praise. I'm only mentioning it cause there are things I'm still unaware of. 'Redshirt character' was one of those.
19-02-2019T18:00:52,Bgrmystr2,not worth*
19-02-2019T18:01:42,ThingsAreMoving,Well Karen is getting some valuable screen time
19-02-2019T18:02:02,Bgrmystr2,"it's a goldilocks zone I feel. If you're too important, then bad shit will happen to you constantly."
19-02-2019T18:02:07,ThingsAreMoving,I hope Maren will be involved in some shenanigans too
19-02-2019T18:02:13,Bgrmystr2,"If you're not important, you can be killed off and noone will miss you."
19-02-2019T18:02:58,Bgrmystr2,"so find the middleground where you're somewhat important, people will miss you if you're gone, but you're not important enough to the story that bad people consider you a threat, or even a target of opportunity"
19-02-2019T18:03:24,Bgrmystr2,"I think Eric, Maren, and Karen all fit that bill perfectly."
19-02-2019T18:03:24,ThingsAreMoving,That reminds me of a sci fi book I read as a teen. Basically there was a dude and his wife and for some strange reason every other characters in the book started dieing off.
19-02-2019T18:04:02,Bgrmystr2,lool sounds pretty scary for the characters xD
19-02-2019T18:04:30,ThingsAreMoving,"It had started off slowly, but the closer you got tho the ending the more people died off. The book had an open ending, where the main character's wife lied on her deathbed and the main character begs you not to read the next page"
19-02-2019T18:04:35,ThingsAreMoving,It was pretty brutal.
19-02-2019T18:05:03,Bgrmystr2,well then
19-02-2019T18:05:04,ThingsAreMoving,I didn't flip that page and she's still alive.
19-02-2019T18:05:10,ThingsAreMoving,ish
19-02-2019T18:05:16,Bgrmystr2,"haha ""ish"""
19-02-2019T18:05:28,Bgrmystr2,yeah that kind of stuff is pretty uncommon.
19-02-2019T18:05:55,Bgrmystr2,Everything I see kills the unimportant side characters who mean nothing to the story.. or the main characters because they ARE important to the story.
19-02-2019T18:06:23,Bgrmystr2,I'll just.. yknow.. watch from the bleachers. :)
19-02-2019T18:06:25,ThingsAreMoving,"the book is called Nest of worlds, by M. Huberath."
19-02-2019T18:06:34,ThingsAreMoving,In case you ever want to read it.
19-02-2019T18:06:46,Bgrmystr2,big pass xD
19-02-2019T18:08:10,unsteddyphoenix,That sounds pretty cool tbh
19-02-2019T18:08:32,unsteddyphoenix,I can't believe you managed to resist turning that page

19-02-2019T18:29:35,ThingsAreMoving,I want to give some reference to that whole 'reading is radical' thing.

19-02-2019T18:32:08,TerraTheWizard,*able
19-02-2019T18:33:28,TerraTheWizard,which character do you choose
19-02-2019T18:34:24,Dadrobit,Trace I guess? Humans are OP as heck and the dude's got power and influence out the wazoo.

19-02-2019T18:36:27,Dadrobit,"Secondary to that would be Raine maybe? Potentially more power? Though that comes at the risk of being a dude trapped in a girls body, and we've got plenty of that already thank you very much."

19-02-2019T18:45:28,TerraTheWizard,usually deleting it from your watch history on youtube fixes it

19-02-2019T18:59:17,Dadrobit,And probably end up just playing with her dogs.
19-02-2019T18:59:48,ThingsAreMoving,Happy b-day for your sister. Enjoy the cake.

19-02-2019T19:03:28,unsteddyphoenix,I like the idea that being exposed to humans turned her into a massive awkward dork

19-02-2019T19:04:16,Dadrobit,Gotta go hit up a crafts store and get her a gift card first though.
19-02-2019T19:04:25,Dadrobit,Because I'm a terrible brother.
19-02-2019T19:05:13,unsteddyphoenix,Just make her one in crayon
19-02-2019T19:05:21,unsteddyphoenix,Like a good younger brother
19-02-2019T19:06:15,Dadrobit,"She did that for me once. Gave me an ""IOU One Video Game"" crayon gift card."
19-02-2019T19:06:38,Dadrobit,I think it was colored pencil though.
19-02-2019T19:06:53,Dadrobit,Redeemed it for Red Dead Redemption.

19-02-2019T19:07:55,ThingsAreMoving,all the time
19-02-2019T19:08:02,Twokinds,One of Reni's biggest fears is that she's going to end up conceited like other dragons when she gets older.
19-02-2019T19:08:16,SpazztasticKiwi,I just had lunch and I could go for strawberries
19-02-2019T19:08:21,unsteddyphoenix,Fear or goal?
19-02-2019T19:09:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Ah but there’s a difference between conceited and self confident
19-02-2019T19:09:34,unsteddyphoenix,I'm sure that's every humans fear too
19-02-2019T19:09:45,ThingsAreMoving,You know what would help keep her ego in place? A human boyfriend!
19-02-2019T19:10:19,SpazztasticKiwi,You know that Oliver and company movie with “perfect isn’t easy”?
19-02-2019T19:11:16,unsteddyphoenix,Depends on the human
19-02-2019T19:11:29,unsteddyphoenix,Are you volunteering?
19-02-2019T19:11:47,unsteddyphoenix,Is that the one with olivertwist
19-02-2019T19:12:16,ThingsAreMoving,I would. But I think we have someone who can facepalm at her when she starts to think she's better than everyone else.
19-02-2019T19:12:22,ThingsAreMoving,:ctwokinds-keifacepalm: <- him
19-02-2019T19:12:52,Twokinds,She's a black-scaled dragon which pretty much means she's destined for evil.
19-02-2019T19:13:17,ThingsAreMoving,...are you hinting something?
19-02-2019T19:13:33,ThingsAreMoving,I still remember the pissed off Reni from the first concept of this chapter's page
19-02-2019T19:13:40,ThingsAreMoving,title page*
19-02-2019T19:14:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah but making the dark colors evil is sooooo overdone
19-02-2019T19:14:27,unsteddyphoenix,That's so racist Tom
19-02-2019T19:14:35,SpazztasticKiwi,You wouldn’t do that would you
19-02-2019T19:14:57,unsteddyphoenix,Plus everyone knows that it's those dirty red dragons that are actually evil
19-02-2019T19:14:58,ThingsAreMoving,"xD I didn't even consider that in terms of race, Teddy."
19-02-2019T19:17:03,unsteddyphoenix,You must not see colour
19-02-2019T19:17:16,unsteddyphoenix,That's why your name is white
19-02-2019T19:19:07,ThingsAreMoving,White is pure
19-02-2019T19:19:18,ThingsAreMoving,but black is relaxing
19-02-2019T19:19:46,Xexanoth,nah Keiren is gonna keep Reni pure(not literally but....)
19-02-2019T19:20:59,SpazztasticKiwi,What about the ancient legend of the white and black bull
19-02-2019T19:22:15,SpazztasticKiwi,One is evil the other good. You can summon only one at a time. But only by learning of them will you keep from making the mistake of summoning the wrong one
19-02-2019T19:22:49,unsteddyphoenix,Can't I be friends with both
19-02-2019T19:22:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Because the one you do will either help you or help itself
19-02-2019T19:23:40,Twokinds,Mrs Nibbly's tail is annoying

19-02-2019T19:24:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Sounds like a problem you made for yourself
19-02-2019T19:25:36,ThingsAreMoving,Nibbs = Nibbs + tail -> Nibbs - Nibbs = tail -> tail = 0
19-02-2019T19:25:39,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s an idea for a sketch - Nibbly gets in a fight with Trace’s electric razor
19-02-2019T19:25:40,ThingsAreMoving,it's not so big
19-02-2019T19:26:08,Bgrmystr2,that's not how math works.
19-02-2019T19:26:09,ThingsAreMoving,advanced tail maff don't lie
19-02-2019T19:26:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I got a 98 average in pre cal and that doesn’t compute with me

19-02-2019T19:29:16,SpazztasticKiwi,I just let out an unhuman laugh in the break room
19-02-2019T19:29:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Thanks
19-02-2019T19:30:03,ThingsAreMoving,I bet your coworkers start to fear you.
19-02-2019T19:30:12,Xexanoth,"so what you're saying is, the tail isn't big enough!"
19-02-2019T19:31:47,ThingsAreMoving,"Do squirrels get winter coat, or do they hibernate?"
19-02-2019T19:31:54,ThingsAreMoving,Can't remember.
19-02-2019T19:31:54,unsteddyphoenix,I'm on board with tail panels
19-02-2019T19:32:03,Xexanoth,hibernate
19-02-2019T19:32:06,SpazztasticKiwi,They hibernate
19-02-2019T19:32:07,Xexanoth,with breaks
19-02-2019T19:32:17,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s why there’s always nuts everywhere
19-02-2019T19:32:20,SpazztasticKiwi,They forget
19-02-2019T19:32:42,SpazztasticKiwi,"Speaking of, do you guys know what an corn is?"
19-02-2019T19:32:46,ThingsAreMoving,"Welp, there goes my "" winter coat super floofy Mrs. Nibbly"" idea"
19-02-2019T19:32:49,SpazztasticKiwi,an acorn
19-02-2019T19:33:20,ThingsAreMoving,"an acorn is an oak tree seen, yes?"
19-02-2019T19:33:22,SpazztasticKiwi,An oak tree in a nutshell
19-02-2019T19:33:25,ThingsAreMoving,seed
19-02-2019T19:33:27,unsteddyphoenix,Kat doesn't get a winter coat
19-02-2019T19:33:30,ThingsAreMoving,wow
19-02-2019T19:33:31,SpazztasticKiwi,🥁
19-02-2019T19:33:45,unsteddyphoenix,Don't let peaky reality stop you from fliofynibbly
19-02-2019T19:33:54,ThingsAreMoving,"I chuckled. Well done, Kiwi"
19-02-2019T19:35:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I heard that pun and like others I wasn’t sure if I wanted to laugh more than throw something
19-02-2019T19:38:32,ThingsAreMoving,"Tom, are you familiar with origami?"
19-02-2019T19:39:20,Twokinds,Yeah
19-02-2019T19:40:27,ThingsAreMoving,Cool. Cause that's going to be in my next suggestion.
19-02-2019T19:41:20,Xexanoth,"Things, most animals that hibernate still get wintercoat"
19-02-2019T19:41:50,Xexanoth,wanna keep warm after all
19-02-2019T19:42:05,Xexanoth,since you lack the warmth from movement
19-02-2019T19:42:14,ThingsAreMoving,"Good to know. Wasn't sure about squirrels, cause they tend to weave nests to keep them warm"
19-02-2019T19:43:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Now I’m picturing a crocheting squirrel
19-02-2019T19:43:38,unsteddyphoenix,Origami...
19-02-2019T19:43:47,SpazztasticKiwi,And a better question may be Tom do you have the slightest clue how to draw origami
19-02-2019T19:44:01,ThingsAreMoving,:ctwokinds-nibsbounce: add 8-10 pixels and you'll have chrocheting Nibbly
19-02-2019T19:44:22,Xexanoth,squirrels also leave their nest on ocation in winter to refuel during hibernation
19-02-2019T19:44:47,Xexanoth,*occasion
19-02-2019T19:44:47,Twokinds,I'm pretty good at drawing food so I think I could draw origami.
19-02-2019T19:45:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Ok someone turn down the National Geographic channel
19-02-2019T19:45:40,SpazztasticKiwi,You think. Well good luck 🍀
19-02-2019T19:46:04,ThingsAreMoving,"Xex, I think Kiwi doesn't enjoy squirrel facts. Move on to snow leopard facts."
19-02-2019T19:46:47,ThingsAreMoving,"Also there's lots of reference pictures of various origami figurines online, so there's that."
19-02-2019T19:46:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Nah. I’m kidding
19-02-2019T19:47:09,SpazztasticKiwi,You can..gopher more facts
19-02-2019T19:47:15,SpazztasticKiwi,🥁
19-02-2019T19:47:18,ThingsAreMoving,:ctwokinds-keifacepalm:
19-02-2019T19:49:30,ThingsAreMoving,"Alright. I'm gonna hit the hay a bit early tonight. Good talking to you, people, as always. Cya :ctwokinds-soon:"
19-02-2019T19:49:33,ThingsAreMoving,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
19-02-2019T19:52:25,unsteddyphoenix,Night my boy
19-02-2019T19:53:11,unsteddyphoenix,Origami is good food
19-02-2019T19:54:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Lunch over
19-02-2019T19:54:14,SpazztasticKiwi,2 hours to go
19-02-2019T19:54:55,SpazztasticKiwi,✌🏻
19-02-2019T19:56:47,Ordithus,:snowman2:
19-02-2019T20:17:44,RimaDraws,Hi
19-02-2019T20:46:40,Ordithus,Hi Rima
19-02-2019T22:01:49,SpazztasticKiwi,I live
19-02-2019T22:02:14,Ordithus,o/
19-02-2019T22:03:47,SpazztasticKiwi,And I may know where my sealer is
19-02-2019T22:04:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Though it might be busted
19-02-2019T23:00:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Well the test is underway for the sealer on pained and nonpainted clay
19-02-2019T23:00:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Now I wait
19-02-2019T23:09:58,SpazztasticKiwi,How’s the Nibbly work
19-02-2019T23:10:12,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-power:
19-02-2019T23:22:53,RimaDraws,hey again. dozed off
19-02-2019T23:43:31,SpazztasticKiwi,So the sealer has dried
19-02-2019T23:43:52,SpazztasticKiwi,"It looks like with paint, it seals the clay and hardens it"
19-02-2019T23:44:59,Ordithus,Success?
19-02-2019T23:45:03,SpazztasticKiwi,But not completely. Layers might though. And the non painted test seems about the same
19-02-2019T23:45:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I guess this means I’m painting my figure and setting it tonight
19-02-2019T23:52:14,Dadrobit,"Back, went and saw Cold Pursuit."
19-02-2019T23:52:39,Dadrobit,"It was a very strange combination of seriously brutal, and very very funny."
19-02-2019T23:52:58,Dadrobit,"Oh, and, unsteddy, my sister says hi."
