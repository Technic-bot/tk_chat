22-11-2019T00:05:04,SageSaga,now- send me money so i can save up for a new tablet (that i think gets announced Wednesday in Japan)
22-11-2019T00:05:11,AnuSekaniArt,:csagesaga-c3:
22-11-2019T00:05:17,steelabjur,Happy birthday Sage (I'll say it now because I probably won't be around Sunday ;))!
22-11-2019T00:05:31,NezumiYuki,"What new tablet is this, Sage?"
22-11-2019T00:05:56,SageSaga,rumor is Wacom will have new Tablet PCs next week
22-11-2019T00:06:01,Nekonny,ah
22-11-2019T00:06:11,NezumiYuki,Oh tablet PC!
22-11-2019T00:06:15,NezumiYuki,geez
22-11-2019T00:06:17,Sclimshady,That cannot be cheap
22-11-2019T00:06:20,IronHorseComics,just in time for Christmas
22-11-2019T00:06:23,RimaDraws,wacom is a bit overpriced
22-11-2019T00:06:35,IronHorseComics,it's just a pity I'm spending me money on model trains most likely
22-11-2019T00:06:37,SageSaga,the 16 inch full spec one is 3500
22-11-2019T00:06:45,IronHorseComics,OOF!
22-11-2019T00:06:52,RimaDraws,iron my dad loved his model trains
22-11-2019T00:06:52,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Thats more then my car
22-11-2019T00:06:54,Sclimshady,A small price to pay
22-11-2019T00:07:12,Sclimshady,Thats more than all my trucks
22-11-2019T00:07:15,IronHorseComics,it's definitely a hobby you gotta love
22-11-2019T00:07:30,Ordithus,It's Sage's job
22-11-2019T00:07:33,IronHorseComics,"because let me tell you, it is not a CHEAP hobby"
22-11-2019T00:07:35,NezumiYuki,"Well maybe... but you can't say their products aren't worth the coins... My ArtZ2 lasted for ages, and so is my Bamboo.   If I could, I'd get me a Cintuq!"
22-11-2019T00:07:50,ZRO4825,Here I am just happy to likely be getting an XP-Pen Artist 12 Pro for Xmas. :joy:
22-11-2019T00:07:58,NezumiYuki,Cintiq*
22-11-2019T00:08:47,Nekonny,thats a lot of coin sage
22-11-2019T00:09:03,IronHorseComics,"Sage that cintique is more than half of what I paid for my Rav 4, I think it may not be worth it"
22-11-2019T00:09:13,SageSaga,which is why i want to know more about the 13 inch ones than the 16
22-11-2019T00:09:18,ZRO4825,lol
22-11-2019T00:09:26,IronHorseComics,how high are those?
22-11-2019T00:09:38,SageSaga,they havent been priced yet but probably 2k
22-11-2019T00:09:59,IronHorseComics,"I still say ""ouch"" to that"
22-11-2019T00:10:00,Sclimshady,Di..did Reni just blink????  I may be going crazy
22-11-2019T00:10:11,NezumiYuki,That's not unreasonable for a Studio Grade product
22-11-2019T00:10:45,IronHorseComics,"my god, she's alive in the comic! QUICK! HIDE UNDER THE DESK BEFORE HER DRAGON MAGIC ACCIDENTALLY SUCKS YOU INTO THE COMIC!"
22-11-2019T00:11:14,SageSaga,think of it this way- it's a laptop- with a built in studio grade tablet
22-11-2019T00:11:25,SageSaga,the one im currently using cost me 1k
22-11-2019T00:11:29,Ordithus,That makes a lot more sense
22-11-2019T00:11:45,Ordithus,Downright affordable compared to the surface line
22-11-2019T00:12:03,SageSaga,i did not like drawing on the surface
22-11-2019T00:12:06,SageSaga,it didnt feel right
22-11-2019T00:12:09,NezumiYuki,I wouldn't mind that!  I can only hope that my own magic is compatible with Keidran and Dark Basitin Majiks!  You know what Raven said... Mixing magic is dangerous...
22-11-2019T00:12:35,NezumiYuki,I wouldn't mind visiting the Twokinds universe!
22-11-2019T00:13:14,iliar,"Tom, I want to clarify. For a long time you refused to draw human Reni. Now we see her in comic so now this allowed for suggestions."
22-11-2019T00:13:20,iliar,Bot what about Keiren x Reni. As I expected it's still forbidden. Right?
22-11-2019T00:13:54,MuonNeutrino,"he's done several sketches with kei and reni in them, including one that was a 'date' of sorts, they've all just involved reni in other forms than human"
22-11-2019T00:14:40,Twokinds,Yeah I've already done suggestions with the two of them
22-11-2019T00:14:49,Twokinds,Reni kissed Kei under the mistletoe
22-11-2019T00:15:32,iliar,Right. I forgot about it.
22-11-2019T00:15:46,CrRAR,haha
22-11-2019T00:15:47,iliar,And a date at the restaurant
22-11-2019T00:15:52,NezumiYuki,LOL Dragon noms!
22-11-2019T00:16:00,CrRAR,...and hid nearby in a bush...

22-11-2019T00:16:41,IronHorseComics,I don't remember the kiss

22-11-2019T00:31:41,IronHorseComics,yeah
22-11-2019T00:31:52,SageSaga,that's probably good then
22-11-2019T00:31:54,IronHorseComics,"well, the animated one of the late 90s"
22-11-2019T00:31:59,Combak,Hi Schlim!

22-11-2019T00:32:38,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Hecking Cute, Ron"
22-11-2019T00:33:00,IronHorseComics,yeah Spielberg's animation studio was going to do one in the late 90's but the project died in 1997 when the studio closed down
22-11-2019T00:33:03,Sclimshady,"Yeah, shes lookin absolutely adorable"
22-11-2019T00:33:11,IronHorseComics,you should see the concept art for it
22-11-2019T00:33:46,AnuSekaniArt,Ron that's adorable <3
22-11-2019T00:33:47,SageSaga,you got my hopes up and then dashed them thoroughly
22-11-2019T00:34:11,IronHorseComics,"I did say Spielberg, is he doing this new one?"
22-11-2019T00:34:15,NezumiYuki,"Again, Ron kitty does teh CUTE! <3"

22-11-2019T00:37:17,Sclimshady,How????
22-11-2019T00:37:34,AnuSekaniArt,Lotta CGI :P
22-11-2019T00:37:39,IronHorseComics,"as a producer, the director, and screen writer"
22-11-2019T00:37:51,Sclimshady,I miss the old days without CGI
22-11-2019T00:37:55,CrRAR,Getting all those high profile actors to dress up in mocap suits I bet too xD
22-11-2019T00:37:56,AnuSekaniArt,Warner Bros spent $25 million alone digitally removing Henry Cavill's mustache :P

22-11-2019T00:38:32,Sclimshady,Id shave my head for less that 25 mil easy
22-11-2019T00:38:36,IronHorseComics,getting the rights for it had to be pricey
22-11-2019T00:38:37,Sclimshady,Than*
22-11-2019T00:38:39,AnuSekaniArt,Nah Cavill was under contract to keep it from Paramount for MI Fallout
22-11-2019T00:38:39,NezumiYuki,Most welcome Ron!
22-11-2019T00:39:05,AnuSekaniArt,"Even though WB offered to pay the cost to CG his mustache back on, which would have cost less and turned out better than what we got XD"
22-11-2019T00:39:28,IronHorseComics,they should have just asked furry artists for help
22-11-2019T00:39:36,CrRAR,haha
22-11-2019T00:39:43,Sclimshady,It would have saved the movie
22-11-2019T00:39:56,SageSaga,no one wants to ask furry artists for help
22-11-2019T00:40:01,SageSaga,that just makes more furries

22-11-2019T00:40:49,Sclimshady,Zootopia was a superbug in that regard i'd think
22-11-2019T00:40:57,SageSaga,if your only goal is to propagate then you are no better than a virus

22-11-2019T00:41:57,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Propagation is its own profit
22-11-2019T00:42:00,IronHorseComics,what? who wouldn't want to make money for the work they do?
22-11-2019T00:42:39,SageSaga,you do it too well and someone else will start doing it better and cheaper
22-11-2019T00:43:01,IronHorseComics,"and then they start doing it too well, the cycle never ends"

22-11-2019T01:22:56,Sclimshady,Supine with your knees bent is the best way
22-11-2019T01:23:04,Sclimshady,Relieves all the pressure
22-11-2019T01:23:13,AnuSekaniArt,Well here's hoping next week is better for the both of us Lann :ctwokinds-rainehappy:
22-11-2019T01:23:49,LannAF,yeah

22-11-2019T01:24:37,LannAF,it'd be nice iif I could stop coughing honestly.
22-11-2019T01:25:26,SageSaga,I should draw Lann as a background character sometime
22-11-2019T01:25:46,MarvTheHugPharaoh,yes
22-11-2019T01:25:49,LannAF,just some random character
22-11-2019T01:25:51,AnuSekaniArt,Do it XD
22-11-2019T01:25:53,LannAF,coughing up a fuckin storm
22-11-2019T01:25:58,Ordithus,Getting mugged in the back
22-11-2019T01:26:05,LannAF,as the scene progresses seeing it get more and more violent
22-11-2019T01:26:17,LannAF,ending by getting carried off by a group of concerned individuals
22-11-2019T01:26:23,LannAF,im dying
22-11-2019T01:26:24,Sclimshady,XD
22-11-2019T01:26:25,AnuSekaniArt,Have him be a cabbage vendor in a market :P
22-11-2019T01:26:33,Ordithus,"""HE's got the plague, RUN!"""
22-11-2019T01:26:36,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Stop dying, thats not allowed"
22-11-2019T01:26:43,LannAF,if you hear my voice rn
22-11-2019T01:26:49,LannAF,it sounds like you coated gravel in sandpaper
22-11-2019T01:26:56,Sclimshady,Dying was banned in 1956
22-11-2019T01:27:00,LannAF,sandpaper grit
22-11-2019T01:27:37,SageSaga,im gonna be pissed if i wake up tomorrow with Laryngitis
22-11-2019T01:27:55,iliar,"Tom, I have a question about human Reni. In Nora’s ref sheet you say ""Nora specifically avoids taking human due to those species' connection to the masks"""
22-11-2019T01:28:05,iliar,But Reni did it. This is because she is not yet experienced and does not know what problems this can create. Or is it because Nora has a special relationship with masks and for other dragons to take a human form is not so dangerous.
22-11-2019T01:29:24,LannAF,sage our illnesses are linked
22-11-2019T01:29:36,LannAF,one of us must live
22-11-2019T01:29:40,LannAF,the other will die
22-11-2019T01:29:54,AspiringNoodle,My money's on Sage winning
22-11-2019T01:29:57,AspiringNoodle,:upside_down:
22-11-2019T01:29:58,LannAF,I'll take the better option
22-11-2019T01:30:05,LannAF,catch you guys in an isekai or something
22-11-2019T01:30:13,AspiringNoodle,I change my mind?
22-11-2019T01:30:17,AspiringNoodle,._.
22-11-2019T01:30:24,SageSaga,heck no im gonna be isekai'd first
22-11-2019T01:30:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I get anywhere around you two I’m wearing a hazmat suit

22-11-2019T01:30:33,SpazztasticKiwi,y’all just crawling with germs
22-11-2019T01:30:41,LannAF,hold up let me have another coughing fit
22-11-2019T01:31:04,SpazztasticKiwi,it is cold and flu season - you so much as hiccup near me and I’ll mace you with lysol
22-11-2019T01:31:38,Ordithus,Hi Kiwi!
22-11-2019T01:31:57,SpazztasticKiwi,yo
22-11-2019T01:31:59,LannAF,you underestimate my power
22-11-2019T01:31:59,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Kiwi!
22-11-2019T01:32:06,LannAF,of blindly flailing and charging ahead.
22-11-2019T01:32:10,Sclimshady,Hi Kiwi o/
22-11-2019T01:32:11,SpazztasticKiwi,MARV!!
22-11-2019T01:32:22,SpazztasticKiwi,sclim!
22-11-2019T01:32:25,RimaDraws,LANN
22-11-2019T01:32:28,SageSaga,Lysol kills 99.8% of germs- unfortunately the .2% are the really bad ones
22-11-2019T01:32:28,LannAF,RIMA
22-11-2019T01:32:35,LannAF,I -am- the .2%
22-11-2019T01:32:36,Sclimshady,DONKEY!
22-11-2019T01:32:44,LannAF,SAGE!
22-11-2019T01:32:52,LannAF,also hi for reals Rima
22-11-2019T01:32:53,LannAF,:D
22-11-2019T01:32:55,SpazztasticKiwi,are you insinuating you two are the .2% of germs?
22-11-2019T01:33:02,LannAF,I am a germ yes
22-11-2019T01:33:04,RimaDraws,hi
22-11-2019T01:33:04,LannAF,and I am really bad
22-11-2019T01:33:05,SpazztasticKiwi,cause I can believe it
22-11-2019T01:33:07,LannAF,"At like, everything."
22-11-2019T01:33:14,LannAF,so yeah there's that one.
22-11-2019T01:35:23,SageSaga,cakeless birthday tomorrow
22-11-2019T01:36:07,SpazztasticKiwi,🎂
22-11-2019T01:36:29,SageSaga,see- if i lived on the internet i would never go hungry
22-11-2019T01:36:39,JojoF2415,Hello
22-11-2019T01:36:46,LannAF,you would also get unlimited anime waifus
22-11-2019T01:36:52,LannAF,hello JOJOOOOO
22-11-2019T01:37:06,SageSaga,i think you mean i would find the limit of anime waifus
22-11-2019T01:37:17,LannAF,fair enough
22-11-2019T01:37:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ll bake a cake for you sage
22-11-2019T01:37:21,JojoF2415,I was unfortunate in capture the flag today
22-11-2019T01:37:30,LannAF,I'd find the limits to how ridiculous an adventure I could have
22-11-2019T01:37:40,LannAF,oh? how so jojo?
22-11-2019T01:38:11,Ordithus,"Imma get some sleep, good night everyone!  Thanks for streaming as always, Sage"
22-11-2019T01:38:21,Sclimshady,Night Ord o/
22-11-2019T01:38:24,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
22-11-2019T01:38:28,MarvTheHugPharaoh,nighty night ord
22-11-2019T01:38:29,JojoF2415,Let’s just say I grabbed something that wasn’t the persons flag they had on
22-11-2019T01:38:30,SageSaga,"*Sage returns with full beard and many scars to his little home- Rem greets him holding back tears* ""Welcome home!"" ""I'm Home..."""
22-11-2019T01:39:03,SageSaga,that's a long silly way to say Rem is still best girl
22-11-2019T01:39:20,JojoF2415,I used to watch re zero
22-11-2019T01:39:48,JojoF2415,Is season 2 out?
22-11-2019T01:40:04,LannAF,oof
22-11-2019T01:40:06,LannAF,goodnight Ord!
22-11-2019T01:40:10,ZRO4825,I still need to finish that...one of these years.
22-11-2019T01:40:36,Sclimshady,"Rem was willing to up and leave her life, she's ride or"
22-11-2019T01:40:37,AnuSekaniArt,It's on my list
22-11-2019T01:40:44,JojoF2415,Why do people hate sao?
22-11-2019T01:40:59,AnuSekaniArt,Old roommate told me that Rem is best girl and not to let anyone tell me otherwise :P
22-11-2019T01:42:08,SageSaga,people hate SAO because it had so much potential but its falls apart and turns into trash at many points from bad writing
22-11-2019T01:42:15,AnuSekaniArt,SAO started off with a really interesting premise but quickly devolved into some of the worst examples of anime harem tropes
22-11-2019T01:42:29,SageSaga,so SAO is great- but is ruined- and that makes it THE WORSE  XD
22-11-2019T01:42:45,AnuSekaniArt,Oh yeah XD
22-11-2019T01:42:50,AnuSekaniArt,It gets WAY too much hate iirc
22-11-2019T01:42:55,AspiringNoodle,Season 1 Part 1: AMAZING :ptv-excited:
22-11-2019T01:42:57,JojoF2415,I like the half of season 1 and all of 3
22-11-2019T01:42:57,SageSaga,because if you have something that is bad- its just bad- but if you have something great and make it bad- then it's terrible
22-11-2019T01:43:03,AspiringNoodle,Season 2 Part 2: Had potential but ruined
22-11-2019T01:43:10,AspiringNoodle,Season 1 Part 2*
22-11-2019T01:43:12,AnuSekaniArt,It's not great but it's not nearly as terrible as some people say it is
22-11-2019T01:43:21,AnuSekaniArt,I've heard Alicization is pretty decent though
22-11-2019T01:43:26,AspiringNoodle,^
22-11-2019T01:43:39,Sclimshady,"I dont like the harem trope at all,  but it was easily watchable for me"
22-11-2019T01:43:40,JojoF2415,It is but the fight in the end is inappropriate
22-11-2019T01:43:42,SageSaga,people will always over react to something they love turning into something they hate
22-11-2019T01:44:02,LannAF,cough
22-11-2019T01:44:05,LannAF,game of thrones
22-11-2019T01:44:08,LannAF,or should I say
22-11-2019T01:44:10,LannAF,game of throws
22-11-2019T01:44:13,SageSaga,Star Wars
22-11-2019T01:44:17,LannAF,cuz they threw it out the window
22-11-2019T01:44:18,Sclimshady,Never read or watched
22-11-2019T01:44:18,LannAF,that too
22-11-2019T01:44:18,JojoF2415,I don’t like anime anymore
22-11-2019T01:44:33,LannAF,I watched an anime recently by myself that I actually quite enjoyed
22-11-2019T01:44:36,LannAF,which is weird
22-11-2019T01:44:43,JojoF2415,I like to draw it but rarely watch it
22-11-2019T01:44:45,LannAF,"I don't tend to just go out and watch anime by myself, only with sticky"
22-11-2019T01:44:46,Sclimshady,Which one
22-11-2019T01:44:56,AnuSekaniArt,I've been meaning to watch more anime lol
22-11-2019T01:44:59,JojoF2415,I play video games
22-11-2019T01:45:06,LannAF,I don't want to say for fear of judgement.
22-11-2019T01:45:09,LannAF,:eyes:
22-11-2019T01:45:17,SageSaga,spill it
22-11-2019T01:45:21,LannAF,:eyeshake:
22-11-2019T01:45:22,Sclimshady,"This is a judge free zone,  except maybe Sage"
22-11-2019T01:45:27,LannAF,^^^^
22-11-2019T01:45:34,LannAF,SAGE HAS THE EVIL EYE UPON ME
22-11-2019T01:45:37,JojoF2415,Next year I have the biggest build of my life. Don’t know if I’m able to accomplish it
22-11-2019T01:45:37,SageSaga,SAY IT
22-11-2019T01:45:39,LannAF,I FLEE
22-11-2019T01:45:43,SageSaga,SAY IT!!!
22-11-2019T01:45:48,LannAF,AAAAAAAAAA
22-11-2019T01:45:56,LannAF,I actually can't remember the name
22-11-2019T01:46:00,LannAF,workshop witches or something
22-11-2019T01:46:00,SageSaga,. . .
22-11-2019T01:46:14,SageSaga,workshop witches? huh?
22-11-2019T01:46:21,LannAF,I'll find it for you
22-11-2019T01:46:26,LannAF,it's not really that good
22-11-2019T01:46:30,Sclimshady,Intrigued by the name
22-11-2019T01:46:41,LannAF,I've just been needing simple semi trashy stuff to relax to
22-11-2019T01:46:45,SageSaga,Witchcraft Works?
22-11-2019T01:46:54,LannAF,yes that
22-11-2019T01:46:58,SageSaga,i watched that
22-11-2019T01:47:01,SageSaga,it was fine
22-11-2019T01:47:03,SageSaga,XD
22-11-2019T01:47:09,LannAF,yeah that's about right
22-11-2019T01:47:14,LannAF,where I feel about it
22-11-2019T01:47:23,LannAF,It wasn't anywhere close to dr stone or mob psycho but it was simple
22-11-2019T01:47:30,LannAF,I want more adventure
22-11-2019T01:47:55,SageSaga,you still havent seen Bookworm though
22-11-2019T01:47:58,JojoF2415,Someone recommended me to watch dr stone but nah.
22-11-2019T01:48:05,LannAF,dude I'm loving dr stone
22-11-2019T01:48:10,LannAF,and yeah haven't gotten to it sage
22-11-2019T01:48:13,LannAF,gonna watch it with sticky
22-11-2019T01:48:21,SageSaga,Dr Stone is great- im up to date on the manga
22-11-2019T01:48:23,LannAF,"but we haven't even caught up to fire force, mha, or even shokugeki"
22-11-2019T01:48:28,SageSaga,i dont think it updates this week though-
22-11-2019T01:48:32,LannAF,I plan on reading the manga once the season ends
22-11-2019T01:48:33,LannAF,WHAT.
22-11-2019T01:48:41,SageSaga,the manga
22-11-2019T01:48:44,LannAF,nope it did update
22-11-2019T01:48:46,LannAF,oh
22-11-2019T01:48:52,LannAF,phew.
22-11-2019T01:48:56,JojoF2415,I’m waiting for aot season 4
22-11-2019T01:48:58,LannAF,can't wait to cuddle up in bed with sticky
22-11-2019T01:49:03,LannAF,and watch all our new anime
22-11-2019T01:49:09,LannAF,cold weather is the best.
22-11-2019T01:49:15,SageSaga,bookworm is almost over
22-11-2019T01:49:28,SageSaga,its only 14 episodes- it is moving at breakneck speed
22-11-2019T01:49:32,JojoF2415,Rainy weather is my favorite.
22-11-2019T01:51:21,JojoF2415,Do you all know about the mess that is happening on YouTube
22-11-2019T01:51:46,SageSaga,yep we know
22-11-2019T01:52:46,JojoF2415,I deleted my YouTube channel cause of that
22-11-2019T01:53:31,SageSaga,that's uhh- a weird reaction
22-11-2019T01:54:28,JojoF2415,"I don’t want to get fined $42,000"
22-11-2019T01:54:44,SageSaga,i think you read something wrong
22-11-2019T01:56:03,AnuSekaniArt,Wait what? :O
22-11-2019T01:56:07,JojoF2415,"It’s up to 42,000 the fine. If content is for kids or not. I Would record myself drawing anime in time lapse"
22-11-2019T01:56:36,SageSaga,yeah sounds like you read it wrong
22-11-2019T01:56:58,JojoF2415,I watch multiple videos about Coppa
22-11-2019T01:57:12,SageSaga,probably by idiots who dont know what they are talking about
22-11-2019T01:57:25,SageSaga,are you making videos targeting children?
22-11-2019T01:57:33,JojoF2415,No
22-11-2019T01:57:52,JojoF2415,Yet coppa thinks anything animated is for kids
22-11-2019T01:57:56,SageSaga,then you'll be fine- if you want - just make sure you dont have any child tags on your stuff
22-11-2019T01:58:32,SpazztasticKiwi,should’ve heard PhillyD when he did his news bit of coppa
22-11-2019T01:58:34,SageSaga,put a disclaimer at the beginning if you are worried saying - Not intended for Children
22-11-2019T01:58:52,JojoF2415,like if Coppa cares
22-11-2019T01:59:08,SpazztasticKiwi,string of cuss words
22-11-2019T01:59:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"boom, no longer kid content"
22-11-2019T01:59:30,SpazztasticKiwi,he makes the news fun
22-11-2019T01:59:41,JojoF2415,I’m not risking it and thank goodness I’m out of that situation
22-11-2019T02:01:36,SageSaga,you are very uneducated on the system and understanding it
22-11-2019T02:03:06,JojoF2415,I’m not an adult so how am I supposed to understand
22-11-2019T02:03:30,SageSaga,by taking time to learn
22-11-2019T02:03:34,AnuSekaniArt,Have someone who does understand it help you out.
22-11-2019T02:04:22,RimaDraws,from what ive seen you just have to tag your stuff properly
22-11-2019T02:05:08,SageSaga,and even then- a max fine of that much- you will practically always be hit with a warning first- and i highly doubt you meet the minimum requirements for them to care
22-11-2019T02:05:51,AnuSekaniArt,Yeah the COPPA stuff seems pretty overblown
22-11-2019T02:06:03,AnuSekaniArt,":east from what I've seen, but I admit I'm rather uneducated about it"
22-11-2019T02:06:06,AnuSekaniArt,*least
22-11-2019T02:16:40,sunblaze,good morning
22-11-2019T02:16:43,AnuSekaniArt,"So Sage, how was your week?"
22-11-2019T02:16:46,AnuSekaniArt,Morning Sun!
22-11-2019T02:17:49,SageSaga,howdy Sunblaze!
22-11-2019T02:17:53,SageSaga,and my week was- uuhhh
22-11-2019T02:18:02,SageSaga,well it started great and then i got sick
22-11-2019T02:18:39,SpazztasticKiwi,do you like tea
22-11-2019T02:19:00,LannAF,hi sunblaze!
22-11-2019T02:19:04,LannAF,I need tea
22-11-2019T02:19:22,LannAF,if you hear me in voice rn it's just coughing and GROAN
22-11-2019T02:19:41,SpazztasticKiwi,i don’t go in voice chat
22-11-2019T02:19:48,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve figured it’s all locked
22-11-2019T02:20:01,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Its like hearing a war crime. ;-;
22-11-2019T02:20:09,LannAF,only 7 days to die is locked.
22-11-2019T02:20:20,LannAF,but if you join us now you'll be greeted by thebois
22-11-2019T02:20:29,LannAF,a fate worse than death
22-11-2019T02:20:35,SpazztasticKiwi,"but anyhoo, my walmart’s been selling an unsweet black tea"
22-11-2019T02:20:51,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m not even sure it’d work - I’m on my phone
22-11-2019T02:21:06,LannAF,._.
22-11-2019T02:21:25,SpazztasticKiwi,"so far I’ve only bought 2, cause I’ve only seen one bottle at a time on the shelf - and on different shelves"
22-11-2019T02:22:02,SpazztasticKiwi,like a find it game; and the app says “unavailable” in regards to my store
22-11-2019T02:22:35,SpazztasticKiwi,"but while it’s unsweetened, I find it good plain but if it may help if you get some and add some honey"
22-11-2019T02:25:43,SageSaga,all done
22-11-2019T02:26:06,RimaDraws,nice job
22-11-2019T02:26:14,SpazztasticKiwi,wahooo

22-11-2019T02:27:51,LannAF,that's

22-11-2019T02:32:42,Twokinds,Take care!
22-11-2019T02:32:48,LannAF,Goodnight!
22-11-2019T02:33:41,RimaDraws,night lann and tom
22-11-2019T02:34:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"I don’t know why or where they go, but my chats disappear at the end when you guys merge like this"
22-11-2019T02:37:49,SpazztasticKiwi,"Tom, I wonder if I explain my suggestion, it’ll get lengthy but otherwise, it may not make sense"
22-11-2019T02:38:53,SpazztasticKiwi,wat do
22-11-2019T02:39:25,Twokinds,Most people add an explaination after what they want to go into the poll when they have too much information
22-11-2019T02:39:35,Twokinds,Like in a new paragraph.
22-11-2019T02:39:56,Twokinds,I usually don't like this as I means more work for me editing it XD But sometimes it's necessary when people have to link to references and such.
22-11-2019T02:40:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I mean I’d guess my idea is recognizable enough
22-11-2019T02:40:29,SpazztasticKiwi,everyone knows the hump day commercial right?
22-11-2019T02:40:39,iliar,"Tom, I have a question about human Reni. In Nora’s ref sheet you say ""Nora specifically avoids taking human due to those species' connection to the masks"""
22-11-2019T02:40:42,iliar,But Reni did it. This is because she is not yet experienced and does not know what problems this can create. Or is it because Nora has a special relationship with masks and for other dragons to take a human form is not so dangerous.
22-11-2019T02:42:08,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ll try laying  it out - shouldn’t be too long but also I dunno if anyone will even like it
22-11-2019T02:43:25,Twokinds,She doesn't know

22-11-2019T03:02:19,SpazztasticKiwi,only Karen has the mindset of checking the bounce back of someone’s boobage

22-11-2019T03:02:59,AspiringNoodle,That is so cute.
22-11-2019T03:06:05,JojoF2415,Just read it
22-11-2019T03:16:18,SpazztasticKiwi,...I did..?
22-11-2019T03:22:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Maren in the bg like a parent when their kid asks an inappropriate question in public
22-11-2019T03:29:36,Twokinds,It's her fulltime job since her tavern burned down
22-11-2019T03:32:45,SpazztasticKiwi,“(Karen) what do you have?”
22-11-2019T03:32:51,SpazztasticKiwi,“a knife!”
22-11-2019T03:32:57,SpazztasticKiwi,“NO!”
22-11-2019T03:47:16,Twokinds,Exactly

22-11-2019T15:12:27,BadFoMo,Haha.

22-11-2019T15:15:37,JojoF2415,Hi sage
22-11-2019T15:23:27,SpazztasticKiwi,how about the method of teaching your kids you hate vacuuming so they’ll vacuum when they’re mad at you
22-11-2019T15:24:21,SageSaga,not familiar with that method
22-11-2019T15:24:40,sunblaze,hiya

22-11-2019T15:26:15,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve seen someone who supposedly did it when their kids were young (and still gullible)
22-11-2019T15:29:18,FoxxTrotter,"Hi, Sunblaze and Kiwi."
22-11-2019T15:30:11,SpazztasticKiwi,I beat my alarm today

22-11-2019T15:45:53,TeapotOfDoom,Including myself. This seems to make no halt over digital connections as well
22-11-2019T15:45:56,SageSaga,it's either a cold or strep

22-11-2019T16:09:20,BadFoMo,That rope looks too realistic. you're going to have to redraw /every/ brade by hand. Inb4 Sage: **** YOU!
22-11-2019T16:10:20,TeapotOfDoom,a rope brush... next up: draw the entire hot air baloon with this new brush

22-11-2019T16:12:17,SpazztasticKiwi,they also put some candy in here
22-11-2019T16:14:02,SpazztasticKiwi,trying to make us fat so we can’t run away
22-11-2019T16:14:09,RimaDraws,exactly
22-11-2019T16:14:16,RimaDraws,or make it easy to kidnap you
22-11-2019T16:14:30,SpazztasticKiwi,they’d bring me back
22-11-2019T16:14:50,RimaDraws,im saying to prevent you from being kidnapped
22-11-2019T16:15:06,SpazztasticKiwi,be safe - eat cake
22-11-2019T16:15:12,RimaDraws,yess
22-11-2019T16:15:13,TeapotOfDoom,*don't
22-11-2019T16:15:17,SpazztasticKiwi,ohai Tom
22-11-2019T16:15:22,TeapotOfDoom,The cake is a lie!
22-11-2019T16:15:32,SpazztasticKiwi,then have the pie
22-11-2019T16:15:48,TeapotOfDoom,mmm ok. but i want some too
22-11-2019T16:15:58,TeapotOfDoom,apple pie mmmmmmm
22-11-2019T16:18:08,SpazztasticKiwi,turtle cookies with cream cheese frosting
22-11-2019T16:18:10,SpazztasticKiwi,and milk
22-11-2019T16:19:46,TeapotOfDoom,those look awesome (and painful to make)
22-11-2019T16:21:37,TeapotOfDoom,i made eggnogg balls today and they taste increadible
22-11-2019T16:24:28,SageSaga,brb
22-11-2019T16:32:06,TeapotOfDoom,rabble
22-11-2019T16:32:37,TeapotOfDoom,lol that word is just as hillarious as the german translation
22-11-2019T16:32:56,TeapotOfDoom,google translate did not disappoint me xD
22-11-2019T16:39:37,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m scheduled to work thanksgiving
22-11-2019T16:43:04,TeapotOfDoom,the instant i step out of the stairwell my connection dies
22-11-2019T16:43:19,SageSaga,back
22-11-2019T16:43:21,TeapotOfDoom,also that sucks
22-11-2019T16:43:23,SageSaga,sorry about that
22-11-2019T16:45:26,FoxxTrotter,Yeah...my brother has to work on Thanksgiving. We're having our holiday dinner next Sunday.
22-11-2019T16:46:57,SageSaga,when i worked at the hotel- we all worked on Thanksgiving - everyone just had a shorter shift except the night guy
22-11-2019T16:50:17,TeapotOfDoom,that seems kinda fair?
22-11-2019T16:50:44,SageSaga,it was - until some of them would call in sick
22-11-2019T16:51:03,TeapotOfDoom,oh.. well that's just a dick move
22-11-2019T16:51:49,SageSaga,"especially for me because my work days at the hotel were Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays (and on and off Mondays)"
22-11-2019T16:51:59,SageSaga,so i normally never worked on Thursdays
22-11-2019T16:52:37,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m not supposed to work Thursdays
22-11-2019T16:52:38,TeapotOfDoom,where i live you have to do military service but can choose to opt out and instead to social service. i chose to opt out and was an ambulance driver. also christmas eve is bigger then the 25th here. i was scheduled on the 24th. luckily not the night shift
22-11-2019T16:52:50,SpazztasticKiwi,"but on holidays, they ignore your availability"
22-11-2019T16:53:36,TeapotOfDoom,it makes kinda sense cause otherwise that would just screw with the people who are normally supposed to work on these days
22-11-2019T16:53:44,SageSaga,=_= brb again
22-11-2019T16:54:07,TeapotOfDoom,no stress wifi's not good enough for the stream atm anyway -_-
22-11-2019T16:55:13,SpazztasticKiwi,I go in 5 minutes
22-11-2019T16:55:23,TeapotOfDoom,break over?
22-11-2019T16:55:35,SpazztasticKiwi,no break
22-11-2019T16:55:38,SpazztasticKiwi,going in
22-11-2019T16:55:45,TeapotOfDoom,oh k
22-11-2019T16:55:51,TeapotOfDoom,tango 6 I'm going in
22-11-2019T16:56:12,SpazztasticKiwi,for a whole 4 hours
22-11-2019T16:56:21,TeapotOfDoom,without a break?
22-11-2019T16:56:43,SpazztasticKiwi,I might get one might not
22-11-2019T16:56:46,SpazztasticKiwi,supposed to
22-11-2019T16:56:52,TeapotOfDoom,geez

22-11-2019T17:25:55,AnuSekaniArt,Anywho
22-11-2019T17:25:57,AnuSekaniArt,How are we all?
22-11-2019T17:26:26,TeapotOfDoom,cold. the heating's turned of for some reason
22-11-2019T17:27:27,TeapotOfDoom,and you? appart from tired
22-11-2019T17:28:01,AnuSekaniArt,"I'm doing alright, glad I took care of a few things this past week productivity wise"
22-11-2019T17:28:12,AnuSekaniArt,Starting to think I'm overextending myself though
22-11-2019T17:28:50,AnuSekaniArt,"And wondering if I should reevaluate how I do a few things, like my hours billed at work"
22-11-2019T17:29:53,AnuSekaniArt,"Cause currently I only bill what I'd consider ""good hours"", so even though I could be at the office for 10 hours a day and not really have a lunch break, I'll only bill 8 cause I feel like two of those hours were wasted on bad work, bathroom breaks, etc"
22-11-2019T17:30:13,AnuSekaniArt,At least that's what I try to do
22-11-2019T17:31:16,AnuSekaniArt,So maybe I just drop that and try not to spend so much extra time at work doing breaks and stuff lol
22-11-2019T17:31:33,AnuSekaniArt,Also should get into work earlier so I have more time in the PM to do things
22-11-2019T17:31:36,TeapotOfDoom,would make sense. also that's just asking for overtim
22-11-2019T17:34:06,AnuSekaniArt,I don't bill overtime usually unless it's a super busy week.
22-11-2019T17:34:28,TeapotOfDoom,yo sage the front most part of the path still looks kinda off tbh. like a mini dirt wall
22-11-2019T17:35:02,TeapotOfDoom,yeah but i mean staying way longer at work then needed ( i mean i'm the worst exp
22-11-2019T17:35:08,TeapotOfDoom,whoops
22-11-2019T17:36:12,TeapotOfDoom,(i mean I'm the worst example tbh cause i sometimes do 10 or 12 hour days just cause i feel like it and just don't wanna stop. so yeah...)
22-11-2019T17:36:36,AnuSekaniArt,For me it's project workload dependant
22-11-2019T17:37:34,TeapotOfDoom,best part for server maintanance or engineering is in the evening. nobody bothering me so i can really get into the zone without being interupted
22-11-2019T17:37:42,TeapotOfDoom,*time
22-11-2019T17:38:00,TeapotOfDoom,I seem to be tired as well
22-11-2019T17:38:15,AnuSekaniArt,Yeah I feel that
22-11-2019T17:38:35,AnuSekaniArt,So many people were on vacation at my place that it was just me and another guy in our entire cubicle section this past week
22-11-2019T17:38:37,AnuSekaniArt,Was wonderful lol
22-11-2019T17:39:44,TeapotOfDoom,i love working with other people but some tasks require concentration
22-11-2019T17:39:56,TeapotOfDoom,and i am easily distracted
22-11-2019T17:40:08,AnuSekaniArt,Yeee
22-11-2019T17:40:11,AnuSekaniArt,I know how that goes
22-11-2019T17:42:29,TeapotOfDoom,i mean checking a bill of materials for a pcb part for part for consistency with the part distributer against the bom from my engineering drawings? no problem. but don't expect me to even notice any inquiry or whatsoever directed at me for the next two ho
22-11-2019T17:42:33,TeapotOfDoom,hours
22-11-2019T17:42:51,AnuSekaniArt,Lol
22-11-2019T17:44:03,TeapotOfDoom,cause when people do that and i get distracted I'm usually unsure where i was and what's already checked so I HAVE TO START AGAIN
22-11-2019T17:44:22,TeapotOfDoom,which is annoying...
22-11-2019T17:44:35,TeapotOfDoom,i mean i do that multiple times anyway but still sucks
22-11-2019T17:46:27,AnuSekaniArt,Yeah in my case it's cause my cubicle gets loud lol
22-11-2019T17:46:53,TeapotOfDoom,i have sounds dampening headphoes
22-11-2019T17:46:56,TeapotOfDoom,which is nice
22-11-2019T17:47:15,AnuSekaniArt,I need a pair lol
22-11-2019T17:48:00,SageSaga,the best headphones dont have noise cancelling!
22-11-2019T17:48:26,SageSaga,(but they are also for people in places that are quiet)
22-11-2019T17:48:46,TeapotOfDoom,well my bose are sick
22-11-2019T17:49:01,TeapotOfDoom,i love em soo much
22-11-2019T17:49:31,SageSaga,sennheiser 650
22-11-2019T17:50:24,AnuSekaniArt,I'm probs gonna go for some Sony WH1000s
22-11-2019T17:51:08,TeapotOfDoom,sage openbacks right?
22-11-2019T17:51:12,SageSaga,yep
22-11-2019T17:51:32,TeapotOfDoom,they look really hifi. studio monitors?
22-11-2019T17:52:10,TeapotOfDoom,siiick
22-11-2019T17:52:14,SageSaga,they can be used for that but they are mostly just top of the line headphones
22-11-2019T17:52:35,SageSaga,without getting into having vacuum tubes and such in your setup XD
22-11-2019T17:59:56,SageSaga,freakn backgrounds-
22-11-2019T18:00:18,kittyelfie,"I bought a set of Sennheiser.  When I checked the reviews, the reason people didn't like them was that they use RCA plugs instead of the tiny phone ones"
22-11-2019T18:01:14,kittyelfie,"They also downvoted them because they are in tan, rather than being black"
22-11-2019T18:01:15,SageSaga,Sennheiser sells both and they have adapters
22-11-2019T18:01:41,SageSaga,in most cases their large plugs are screw off revealing the standard headphone jack
22-11-2019T18:02:44,SageSaga,o_O most of them are black or blue too
22-11-2019T18:03:08,TeapotOfDoom,i have sennheiser hd25 and those screw adapters are really nice
22-11-2019T18:03:59,TeapotOfDoom,but tbh i like the bose more the sennheiser sound is kinda heavy on highs wich gives clarity but takes energy imo
22-11-2019T18:07:45,SageSaga,im already over 70 layers-
22-11-2019T18:08:55,AnuSekaniArt,Cripes Sage XD
