03-05-2019T00:00:01,Snowdayzz,Did he get it just for those short skits or..
03-05-2019T00:00:08,Snowdayzz,Oh
03-05-2019T00:00:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Far as I know it’s fixed but I dunno what he’s got planned if anything. Might still be recovering from those antibiotics
03-05-2019T00:00:49,RazorToshiba,Mark's a fun dude
03-05-2019T00:00:56,RazorToshiba,|D
03-05-2019T00:01:12,Snowdayzz,"Best thing about vans, CARGO SPACE TO SLEEP"
03-05-2019T00:01:15,AFallingTree,mark is the only youtuber that should be able to flex
03-05-2019T00:01:19,SpazztasticKiwi,He did mention last stream he’s in Texas for a month for some thing
03-05-2019T00:01:27,RimaDraws,pax south
03-05-2019T00:01:29,RazorToshiba,tho tbh the last thing i watched was his SubNautica stuff
03-05-2019T00:01:30,RimaDraws,i think
03-05-2019T00:01:42,SageSaga,nope
03-05-2019T00:01:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Nah. “project”
03-05-2019T00:02:01,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-maddiessparkles:
03-05-2019T00:02:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Sage you follow too?
03-05-2019T00:02:22,ZRO4825,I can sleep in my vehicle if I wanted to. Not a van. Hatchbacks are great cars. :3
03-05-2019T00:02:32,RazorToshiba,Ayyy hatchback club
03-05-2019T00:02:34,Ordithus,Hatchbacks are <3 I want one
03-05-2019T00:02:35,SageSaga,occasionally to inform Tom of what his brother is up to
03-05-2019T00:02:36,RimaDraws,i follow him but i dont know where his every move is
03-05-2019T00:03:00,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m about the same. I remember last vlog he said he was tierd and worn out
03-05-2019T00:03:01,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Ord, like an AE86 or a older camaro?"
03-05-2019T00:03:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Think it was the meds
03-05-2019T00:03:10,ZRO4825,VW Golf ftw
03-05-2019T00:03:27,RazorToshiba,I have the ugly duckling Lancer Sportback
03-05-2019T00:03:31,RazorToshiba,I love it
03-05-2019T00:03:34,Ordithus,"Well since we're talking a daily driver, a Golf or something like it"
03-05-2019T00:03:36,Snowdayzz,Im currently looking for an ae86 levin
03-05-2019T00:03:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Other than that I know just little bits
03-05-2019T00:03:44,Ordithus,The Regal Sportbacks look intriguing...
03-05-2019T00:03:51,SageSaga,Tom- I need your secret powers
03-05-2019T00:03:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Just hope he’s got to feeling better
03-05-2019T00:04:03,Snowdayzz,"Though.. singapore being singapore, theyre probably scrapped"
03-05-2019T00:04:07,SpazztasticKiwi,"Anyhoosies, back to my creepin"
03-05-2019T00:04:19,Snowdayzz,Have been thinking about moving to canada though
03-05-2019T00:04:39,RazorToshiba,"I was gonna say ""AE86 wouldn't you have to import that?"" but i guess that's much easier in Singapore"
03-05-2019T00:05:01,Snowdayzz,No
03-05-2019T00:05:05,SageSaga,"Just for a bit Tom, I promise to give them back"
03-05-2019T00:05:08,MarvTheHugPharaoh,There are 86s that were shipped to the U.S
03-05-2019T00:05:12,Ordithus,I've seen at least 2 here in my little corner of 'murica
03-05-2019T00:05:24,RazorToshiba,yeah as long as it's over 25 years old it's free game to import
03-05-2019T00:06:00,Snowdayzz,"""Mom pack the bags, were going to 'murica to get my 86"""
03-05-2019T00:06:09,RazorToshiba,So really i could get that R32 skyline I wanted
03-05-2019T00:06:18,Ordithus,$$$
03-05-2019T00:06:35,ZRO4825,We've got an R32 running around my area. Don't spot it very often though.
03-05-2019T00:06:39,RazorToshiba,"The AE86 is a japan only model tho, the 85 is the US model, which isn't the same"
03-05-2019T00:06:59,RazorToshiba,"Problem is, i'd want one that hasn't been smoked in..."
03-05-2019T00:07:04,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Same Zro, also got a R34 street racer around here"
03-05-2019T00:07:09,ZRO4825,"Actually, the model referred to as the 86 was here in the US. I believe it's the Corolla GT-S in US specs."
03-05-2019T00:07:25,RazorToshiba,Corrolla GT-S is AE85 on the VIN
03-05-2019T00:07:42,ZRO4825,"Is it? How odd, pretty sure they've got the right body style and everything. :thinking:"
03-05-2019T00:07:53,RazorToshiba,Toyota considers it a different model number since it's left hand drive
03-05-2019T00:07:56,Snowdayzz,"No, the us has longer bumpers"
03-05-2019T00:08:04,RazorToshiba,and that
03-05-2019T00:08:20,RazorToshiba,USA has stricter crash test regulations than Japan
03-05-2019T00:08:21,Bgrmystr2,There's a LOT of confusion but there's actually people who have gone and proven some of the AE85s in the us were actually true 86s
03-05-2019T00:08:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,The U.S got every version of the 86 when it was out
03-05-2019T00:08:28,Snowdayzz,"Now i wonder about tolls, if you import a rhd car"
03-05-2019T00:09:10,MarvTheHugPharaoh,depends on the state snow
03-05-2019T00:09:12,Ordithus,Live in a state without tolls :P
03-05-2019T00:09:24,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-FloDance:
03-05-2019T00:09:26,Snowdayzz,Oh i see

03-05-2019T00:09:36,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-nibsdance:
03-05-2019T00:10:41,RazorToshiba,So drive thru
03-05-2019T00:10:45,RazorToshiba,just go in reverse
03-05-2019T00:10:47,Ordithus,A coworker of mine has a JDM Supra MkIV.  Pretty sure it's only legal because he's canadian
03-05-2019T00:11:03,ZRO4825,:o
03-05-2019T00:11:23,RazorToshiba,Probably because the supra was also released in the US?
03-05-2019T00:11:23,ZRO4825,"Even as an RX-7 owner, I have to say, Supras are some damned sexy beasts <3"
03-05-2019T00:11:40,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:cinfinitedge-LovelyAegis: They are
03-05-2019T00:11:50,MarvTheHugPharaoh,even If the starter is a fucking bitch to get too
03-05-2019T00:11:52,ZRO4825,Fix yours! :O
03-05-2019T00:11:53,Snowdayzz,The new one is just a Z4 though
03-05-2019T00:11:55,RazorToshiba,"Zro, opinion on Lancer Sportback? :eyes:"
03-05-2019T00:12:03,SageSaga,speaking of car stuff- wasnt there a guy who was putting together Teslas?
03-05-2019T00:12:10,Ordithus,"Supras, Rx-7s, all nice"
03-05-2019T00:12:12,RazorToshiba,Yes! i saw hat
03-05-2019T00:12:18,ZRO4825,Lancer Sportback? The model with the weird like station wagon ass-end?
03-05-2019T00:12:19,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Zro, started is seized, gotta pull it out and spin it.  but it will fire up"
03-05-2019T00:12:22,RazorToshiba,yup
03-05-2019T00:12:40,ZRO4825,"I think they're weird, but definitely better than a PT Cruiser."
03-05-2019T00:12:46,SageSaga,i think he bought some that were to be scrapped after wrecks- and he basically got one that was wrecked from behind and another from the front and just-
03-05-2019T00:12:47,ZRO4825,"And nice, Marv~"
03-05-2019T00:12:48,RazorToshiba,that's the one i got because nobody wanted it and the dealer offered it to me for 5K under MSRP
03-05-2019T00:12:48,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
03-05-2019T00:12:50,SageSaga,put em together
03-05-2019T00:13:01,Snowdayzz,Anyone else saw the 4door r34?
03-05-2019T00:13:07,ZRO4825,"lol, Sage, that sounds about right"
03-05-2019T00:13:13,Snowdayzz,There used to be one in my childhood days
03-05-2019T00:13:25,RazorToshiba,4door skylines are weird m'dude
03-05-2019T00:13:28,ZRO4825,"No, and if I did, I would kick it, Snow. That big beast is not meant to be 4-door >:("
03-05-2019T00:13:29,Snowdayzz,I dont know if its scrapped by now
03-05-2019T00:13:53,ZRO4825,It's like Chargers. Chargers are not meant to be 4-doors.
03-05-2019T00:13:56,RazorToshiba,4 door skylines just look like an impala to me
03-05-2019T00:14:44,Snowdayzz,Does anyone here have instagram?
03-05-2019T00:15:17,MarvTheHugPharaoh,yo
03-05-2019T00:15:17,SageSaga,instagram is for people who take selfies!
03-05-2019T00:15:39,Bgrmystr2,lol all the cars look similar to me.
03-05-2019T00:15:49,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:ptv-uneasy: but I do take pis of my self
03-05-2019T00:15:50,Bgrmystr2,don't like any of em
03-05-2019T00:15:53,MarvTheHugPharaoh,don't*
03-05-2019T00:16:35,Snowdayzz,Memes are most of what i uses instagram for
03-05-2019T00:16:45,Snowdayzz,Other than reddit
03-05-2019T00:17:02,MarvTheHugPharaoh,cars and motorcycles are most of my instagram
03-05-2019T00:17:10,SageSaga,did y'all hear Verizon is selling Tumblr?
03-05-2019T00:17:19,Ordithus,haha really?
03-05-2019T00:17:38,Ordithus,Buyer's remorse much?
03-05-2019T00:17:40,SageSaga,Pornhub offered to buy it and return it to the people
03-05-2019T00:17:46,RazorToshiba,lol
03-05-2019T00:17:56,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"XD, kinda hope they do"
03-05-2019T00:18:33,SageSaga,"kinda want to even if its just to hear on the news ""Verizon has struck a deal with Pornhub"""
03-05-2019T00:19:25,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
03-05-2019T00:22:28,Snowdayzz,"Welp, im going mountain biking, hopefully ill catch the x20 video on youtube"

03-05-2019T00:23:15,SageSaga,take care good luck
03-05-2019T00:23:52,Bgrmystr2,I'm hoping they buy it
03-05-2019T00:23:55,Bgrmystr2,that would be absolute justice
03-05-2019T00:25:25,ZRO4825,"Pornhub: ""Yeah, we don't know why Verizon had trouble getting this to make money. We turned the NSFW content back on and now we may as well print the stuff."""
03-05-2019T00:27:41,Bgrmystr2,ikr?
03-05-2019T00:27:44,Bgrmystr2,can't wait
03-05-2019T00:30:35,SageSaga,"a lot of my stuff never got tagged as NSFW - but like 10 posts did- i went through em and said ""This isnt- this isnt- this isnt- this-... hmmmmmm they can have that one- this isnt- this isnt-"""
03-05-2019T00:30:57,Bgrmystr2,that hmmm one I bet was from Zro
03-05-2019T00:31:06,ZRO4825,Why would you think this? D:
03-05-2019T00:31:10,SageSaga,and after review all the ones i sent back were let through
03-05-2019T00:31:32,ZRO4825,I'm sure I am not the only one who likes getting Sage to push the lines of decency!

03-05-2019T00:32:41,ZRO4825,"Just need me and Maty to team up, aye."
03-05-2019T00:33:20,ZRO4825,"What if I win the lottery and throw like, enough money at you to buy like 4 new top of the line computers, Sage? :P"
03-05-2019T00:34:27,SageSaga,then you could afford to send me enough money to get one computer and a mobile studio- and help me live a better life rather than give me 4 pcs?
03-05-2019T00:34:42,ZRO4825,I'd throw you the money! Not the computers!
03-05-2019T00:34:46,ZRO4825,I said enough money FOR that! =D
03-05-2019T00:34:53,Ordithus,Computers are hard to catch
03-05-2019T00:35:01,Ordithus,"Bulky, kinda heavy"
03-05-2019T00:35:03,ZRO4825,throws Ord.
03-05-2019T00:35:17,SageSaga,ah- Top of the line according to me or according to basic standards?
03-05-2019T00:35:19,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-power: oi
03-05-2019T00:35:30,ZRO4825,According to your own specs :3
03-05-2019T00:35:42,SageSaga,and what would i need to do for that?
03-05-2019T00:35:49,ZRO4825,"Well, first I need to win the lottery."
03-05-2019T00:35:57,ZRO4825,"And....honestly, that'd probably be about it XD"
03-05-2019T00:36:24,ZRO4825,"Already made up my mind on that ages ago, if I can win the lottery, throwin money at my favorite artists and my friends. :3"
03-05-2019T00:36:30,SageSaga,yeah but what do you want in return? For me to continue making my comics and stuff?
03-05-2019T00:36:38,ZRO4825,Yus.
03-05-2019T00:36:42,SageSaga,im all for it
03-05-2019T00:36:45,ZRO4825,And possibly fix health issues.
03-05-2019T00:36:53,SageSaga,if only money could do that
03-05-2019T00:37:07,Ordithus,"""What's the catch?"""

03-05-2019T00:39:14,SageSaga,well surgery could be done for the chronic heartburn issue
03-05-2019T00:39:52,SageSaga,the hand thing- well the money would let me take the time off to have that fixed and take time off from work to heal

03-05-2019T00:54:07,Twokinds,My diet has been going very well lately.
03-05-2019T00:54:30,SageSaga,good
03-05-2019T00:55:02,Twokinds,Although I think a large part of it has to do with my being too lazy to cook.
03-05-2019T00:55:07,Twokinds,Leading me to have nothing to eat.
03-05-2019T00:55:17,SageSaga,that's part of it...
03-05-2019T00:56:03,SageSaga,how's this look?
03-05-2019T00:56:12,MarvTheHugPharaoh,looks pretty
03-05-2019T00:56:32,Twokinds,Looks really great! :D

03-05-2019T00:57:02,ZRO4825,"Hmmm....makin me think, perhaps it's time to put Sage ladies in qipaos."
03-05-2019T01:01:37,SageSaga,well- until people get back to me ive completed the list already
03-05-2019T01:02:06,ZRO4825,"lol, you're down to A.I. time for the night anyway, I think?"
03-05-2019T01:02:23,SageSaga,yep time to work on AI
03-05-2019T01:02:37,SageSaga,it's just there are 5 Fridays in this month
03-05-2019T01:02:37,Bgrmystr2,"lol I was gonna say, people like zro"
03-05-2019T01:03:11,SageSaga,so as is there are 5 people who will probably get back to me- one or two will ask for 2 character things- so
03-05-2019T01:03:20,ZRO4825,Hey! I've been really good lately about giving Sage my ideas!
03-05-2019T01:03:26,SageSaga,i might have 3-4 pictures rest for the 4 weeks left
03-05-2019T01:04:03,ZRO4825,"Besides, since he's down to working on A.I. for the rest of the night, I've got another week to think. :P"
03-05-2019T01:04:04,SageSaga,which is nice because i ran myself into the ground last month
03-05-2019T01:04:10,ZRO4825,:(
03-05-2019T01:04:40,SageSaga,someone messaged me with their request when the posts went up for the month
03-05-2019T01:04:51,SageSaga,so i drew it and added it to the post
03-05-2019T01:05:18,ZRO4825,@.@
03-05-2019T01:14:25,SageSaga,it was a 2 character thing so if i didnt do it then technically i would be forcing them to lose a donation reward
03-05-2019T01:16:24,SageSaga,i also totally missed that Mippy joined the sketch tier last month- though Mippy said it was near the end of the month anyways-
03-05-2019T01:16:46,SageSaga,so i did a 2 character for Mippy this month

03-05-2019T02:42:31,scissorchan,jeremyyy
03-05-2019T02:42:40,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Scissor
03-05-2019T02:42:56,scissorchan,holo everyone
03-05-2019T02:44:42,Bgrmystr2,ohey
03-05-2019T02:44:48,SageSaga,yo Scissor
03-05-2019T02:44:48,ZRO4825,I like Holo.
03-05-2019T02:45:06,SageSaga,how? I thought you were a big boob guy
03-05-2019T02:46:13,ZRO4825,"I am. But Holo's frickin adorable. Also, ears and tail. <3"
03-05-2019T02:46:43,ZRO4825,"Given a preference, yes, I like mah big boobers. But I don't discriminate. Except for absolute flats. Cuz that's how you end up with jailbait, and no one wants that."
03-05-2019T02:47:49,SageSaga,it's only jailbait if they are under age
03-05-2019T02:48:13,SageSaga,and usually jail bait is underage with large breasts
03-05-2019T02:48:14,sunblaze,^unless you are an australian
03-05-2019T02:49:45,SageSaga,i dont get it
03-05-2019T02:50:08,sunblaze,australia has a law that defines jailbait to the looks.
03-05-2019T02:50:30,SageSaga,but Jailbait isnt a legal term...
03-05-2019T02:50:36,sunblaze,basically actual age does not matter you can be 23 but look 17 and its illegal to prostitute for that
03-05-2019T02:50:55,sunblaze,no but underage is
03-05-2019T02:51:13,JeremySenpai,:cjeremysenpai-ezgifcom-gif-m-0:Scisssssssssssssssssssssss

03-05-2019T03:06:34,SageSaga,Vector is points and shapes via math
03-05-2019T03:07:38,SageSaga,i might be drawing lines- but the computer is interpreting my movements into mathematical curves with starting and end points and also the values of the pen such as pressure and oppacity

03-05-2019T10:31:17,Ordithus,Raine continues to be adorable
03-05-2019T11:25:57,Sclimshady,How is that news?
03-05-2019T11:27:22,Orthonox,"New comic page looks sweet, Tom."
03-05-2019T11:33:46,CrimsonQuill,Hullo
03-05-2019T11:33:57,CrimsonQuill,"Ooooh, just seen the new comic page!"
03-05-2019T11:34:05,CrimsonQuill,I love where this is going.
03-05-2019T11:47:20,Orthonox,"Ah, you caught up now, Quill. Nice."
03-05-2019T11:49:25,CrimsonQuill,"Yes, I finally caught up before the end of last week. Seeing my favourite character finally about to learn how to use her abilities is heartwarming."
03-05-2019T11:51:34,Orthonox,It is indeed. Love that Rose shows more care to Raine in one page than her parents have ever shown throughout the story.
03-05-2019T11:52:11,CrimsonQuill,"I like the fact that ""the bastards"" is in an offside, muttered font."
03-05-2019T11:52:20,Orthonox,I hereby relinquish your banishment!
03-05-2019T11:52:27,CrimsonQuill,She really is a bit like Minerva McGonnagal.
03-05-2019T11:52:52,CrimsonQuill,"Also, what's the new profile pic, orthonox?"
03-05-2019T11:53:17,Orthonox,It is a jumping spider. The Portia species in particular.
03-05-2019T11:53:23,CrimsonQuill,Oh.
03-05-2019T11:53:45,CrimsonQuill,I do have a...fear towards spiders. But they are amazing creatures.
03-05-2019T11:54:00,CrimsonQuill,I read that jumping spiders have great eyesight.
03-05-2019T11:54:09,Ordithus,"Not a fan of most spiders, but jumping spiders are cool"
03-05-2019T11:54:13,Orthonox,I used to hate spiders but that was because I was ignorant about them.

03-05-2019T11:56:21,CrimsonQuill,I still find them amazing.
03-05-2019T11:56:27,CrimsonQuill,But I still fear them.
03-05-2019T11:56:37,CrimsonQuill,I used to squash them if I was really startled.
03-05-2019T11:56:47,Orthonox,They are truly fascinating creatures.
03-05-2019T11:56:51,CrimsonQuill,Now I toss them outside in a container and release them.
03-05-2019T11:57:07,CrimsonQuill,I can't squish them anymore...not after Muffet and the SPider Bake Sale.
03-05-2019T11:57:13,CrimsonQuill,Flies...on the other hand...
03-05-2019T11:57:26,Orthonox,I will not say I am not afraid of them anymore but I'm very less hesitant to kill them.
03-05-2019T11:57:39,CrimsonQuill,They are intensely useful.
03-05-2019T11:57:56,CrimsonQuill,But I think I'll always be afraid of them.
03-05-2019T11:58:09,CrimsonQuill,Got to go-dinner
03-05-2019T11:58:42,Orthonox,"One day I want to hold a spider, particular a tarantula. That would probably eliminate any remaining fears I have about them."
03-05-2019T11:58:50,Orthonox,"Enjoy dinner, Quill."
03-05-2019T12:00:33,Sclimshady,"I held one at an animal conservation place once, they said to close my eyes and I expected a snake, boy was I surprised"
03-05-2019T12:01:17,Orthonox,In a good or bad way? What made you want to hold a tarantula?
03-05-2019T12:02:04,Sclimshady,"I wanted to hold a snake, they bamboozled me.  It wasnt too bad, tarantulas are actually pretty nice"
03-05-2019T12:03:41,Sclimshady,Every year california has a tarantula migration and thousands of them cover the streets but they wont bother anyone

03-05-2019T14:25:20,ZRO4825,Speed stat leveled up~
03-05-2019T14:26:44,SageSaga,i didnt want points there-
03-05-2019T14:27:29,BadFoMo,Why not?

03-05-2019T14:34:11,ZRO4825,Skyrim's system is fine! You can pick the perk levels at least. RL has a shitty system where you may or may not gain points in any particular skill at any moment in time. And it might not even make sense!
03-05-2019T14:34:24,ZRO4825,"I keep gaining points in laziness, I don't need that, I had that stat high enough already. D:"
