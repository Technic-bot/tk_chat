25-10-2019T00:00:17,SageSaga,i had to stop playing MTG - too expensive
25-10-2019T00:00:30,AnuSekaniArt,Oh I largely have too Sage XD
25-10-2019T00:00:47,AnuSekaniArt,That's why I'm interested in L5R. It's a Living card game so it shouldn't be nearly as expensive
25-10-2019T00:01:07,DesertFox,"Yeah, I just play the video games :P"
25-10-2019T00:01:20,DesertFox,Havent bought any physical cards in years
25-10-2019T00:01:26,OtakuTom,"That's fine, Moon. I've done MTG and stopped multiple times, I tried YGO a couple times, but couldn't find others to play it with."
25-10-2019T00:01:42,SageSaga,900 USD is just too much money to spend on one deck
25-10-2019T00:01:57,DarkMageDragon,Same here Des same here

25-10-2019T00:04:43,AnuSekaniArt,I'll admit to playing some Fate/Grand Order or MTG Puzzle Quest now and then
25-10-2019T00:04:49,DarkMageDragon,Oh damn thats nice!

25-10-2019T00:19:01,MoonlitCaitlyn,"oof, I have a brutal trap card from this bundle too"
25-10-2019T00:19:26,DarkMageDragon,What did you get?
25-10-2019T00:19:27,MoonlitCaitlyn,"Different Dimension Ground, basically any monsters sent to the GY get immediately banished"
25-10-2019T00:19:37,MoonlitCaitlyn,for that turn
25-10-2019T00:19:38,DarkMageDragon,Oh I hate those cards
25-10-2019T00:19:41,Combak,"Well, I'm tired. Night all!"

25-10-2019T00:20:53,DarkMageDragon,"We'rent usable, but they looked like the cards in the anime"
25-10-2019T00:21:05,MoonlitCaitlyn,"whether I wanted it or not, I pretty much have every known Kuriboh card in the series XD"
25-10-2019T00:21:06,Combak,"Thanks Dark Mage, DesertFox."

25-10-2019T00:23:34,DarkMageDragon,Hey Cait? About what you said about one of the archfiends?
25-10-2019T00:23:40,MoonlitCaitlyn,"okay, done with this bundle, I'll need to show Des these cards later XD"
25-10-2019T00:23:41,MoonlitCaitlyn,yeah?
25-10-2019T00:23:48,MysticAxe,I still think mtg is better... though yugioh does have some nice artwork
25-10-2019T00:23:49,DarkMageDragon,Non of them are currently banned
25-10-2019T00:23:57,MoonlitCaitlyn,I love MTG as well
25-10-2019T00:24:15,MoonlitCaitlyn,but I only play with one group here in Colorado and they all suck XD
25-10-2019T00:24:29,MoonlitCaitlyn,it's not fun when your black/blue deck keeps crushing them XDDD
25-10-2019T00:25:06,DarkMageDragon,Cait desires a challenge
25-10-2019T00:25:14,MoonlitCaitlyn,I do
25-10-2019T00:25:16,SageSaga,"""So how does this deck work?"" ""It works by making sure your opponent cant play their deck"" ""That... sounds terrible"""
25-10-2019T00:25:29,MoonlitCaitlyn,lol
25-10-2019T00:25:32,MysticAxe,"I would love to play you on untap which is a free online card game site, play DVD, mtg, yugioh"
25-10-2019T00:25:34,DarkMageDragon,You know there's an online version of MTG coming soon?
25-10-2019T00:25:39,MoonlitCaitlyn,yep
25-10-2019T00:25:43,MoonlitCaitlyn,looking forward to it
25-10-2019T00:25:47,SageSaga,coming soon? wth?
25-10-2019T00:26:01,DesertFox,Yeh
25-10-2019T00:26:03,SageSaga,MTG Online has been out for years
25-10-2019T00:26:24,DesertFox,Oh. Really? Theyve been blasting Youtube with ads recently
25-10-2019T00:26:32,DarkMageDragon,They have
25-10-2019T00:26:40,SageSaga,MTGO has been out since 2002
25-10-2019T00:26:55,SageSaga,MTG Arena has been out for a while too
25-10-2019T00:27:02,MoonlitCaitlyn,there's new game coming out for MTG that will tease the new color deck from what I heard
25-10-2019T00:27:04,MysticAxe,Me and my friends use untap for deck testing... also friend made a deck to play any deck
25-10-2019T00:27:27,MysticAxe,But there’s only 5 colora
25-10-2019T00:27:43,MoonlitCaitlyn,there's...a new color coming out
25-10-2019T00:27:46,MoonlitCaitlyn,didn't you hear?
25-10-2019T00:28:30,MysticAxe,Nope...
25-10-2019T00:28:58,SageSaga,you mean that mix up where a graphics department used Google search and found a fan made magic backing adding purple and they used it in a stream?
25-10-2019T00:29:01,DesertFox,"Oh, I'd thought you'd heard that the bird is the word"
25-10-2019T00:29:16,DesertFox,ewe
25-10-2019T00:29:23,MoonlitCaitlyn,I don't think that was it
25-10-2019T00:30:16,SageSaga,"ok- because there is no ""new color"""
25-10-2019T00:31:00,MoonlitCaitlyn,honestly I kind of hope the new color thing is fake too
25-10-2019T00:31:20,SageSaga,"the only ""new"" MTG video game is Arena and its been out for a while now"
25-10-2019T00:31:41,SageSaga,its been out since last year
25-10-2019T00:34:24,MoonlitCaitlyn,do you still play MTG online Sage?
25-10-2019T00:34:53,SageSaga,i still have my MTGO account- i probably have a few hundred dollars worth in cards on it- but i dont play anymore. I like building decks- and that means I spend a lot more money than most people
25-10-2019T00:35:09,MoonlitCaitlyn,okay
25-10-2019T00:35:20,DesertFox,streeeeeeeeetch
25-10-2019T00:35:21,MoonlitCaitlyn,was just wondering
25-10-2019T00:35:24,DesertFox,Aaaaaaaaaall done
25-10-2019T00:35:36,SageSaga,(generally MTGO card prices are are 1/10th the price they are in paper)
25-10-2019T00:35:59,AnuSekaniArt,Nice Des!
25-10-2019T00:36:03,AnuSekaniArt,And yeah Sage
25-10-2019T00:36:22,AnuSekaniArt,MTG Arena is good for those who want an MTG fix but don't wanna spend muns
25-10-2019T00:36:24,AnuSekaniArt,Buuuuut
25-10-2019T00:36:24,MoonlitCaitlyn,"also really looking forward to the next AI page Sage, I am seriously hooked on your new series"
25-10-2019T00:36:34,AnuSekaniArt,It's PVP only
25-10-2019T00:36:38,SageSaga,well thats what im drawing right now o_o
25-10-2019T00:36:38,AnuSekaniArt,"And ye, AI is great :D'"
25-10-2019T00:36:43,MoonlitCaitlyn,I know XD
25-10-2019T00:36:47,AnuSekaniArt,Need to catch up on Yosh! myself
25-10-2019T00:36:49,MoonlitCaitlyn,that's why I'm mentioning it
25-10-2019T00:37:27,MoonlitCaitlyn,"believe it or not, Yosh! was the whole reason I joined the KB XD"
25-10-2019T00:37:35,SageSaga,i work on AI on the stream every Friday and Saturday
25-10-2019T00:37:41,MoonlitCaitlyn,I was following Sage's comic before he even joined the KB
25-10-2019T00:37:52,DarkMageDragon,Wonder if they'll make ANOTHER new summoning mechanic in the next yugioh series
25-10-2019T00:38:12,MoonlitCaitlyn,please no
25-10-2019T00:38:36,MoonlitCaitlyn,pendulum was convuluted enough. Link summoning was really what got me back into the game
25-10-2019T00:39:09,DarkMageDragon,Yeah they really cant make ANOTHER new one at this point
25-10-2019T00:39:43,SageSaga,one of my favorite decks i made for MTGO i could never play with because the combo would take so long that you would time out
25-10-2019T00:39:44,DesertFox,Cheeeeeeeebs :3
25-10-2019T00:39:50,DesertFox,"Alright, Im gonna sign off o/"

25-10-2019T00:43:59,SageSaga,Prodz Video of how I play card games - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBIsZlV1jHk
25-10-2019T00:44:16,SageSaga,Prozd* typoed
25-10-2019T00:50:02,JojoF2415,Wait I can comment now
25-10-2019T00:50:26,SageSaga,?
25-10-2019T00:51:18,SageSaga,I guess you are banned on Des' channel?
25-10-2019T00:53:21,JojoF2415,I don’t even know how I got banned
25-10-2019T00:55:15,SageSaga,my guess is you said or did something and that got you banned - because it is very rare to be banned for no reason...
25-10-2019T00:56:05,JojoF2415,I was at risk of getting a heart attack. I commented lol. Next second I couldn’t chat. The lol was on someone’s joke on the stream
25-10-2019T00:56:19,Ordithus,:hammer::csagesaga-nynasmirk:
25-10-2019T00:57:12,SageSaga,well you werent banned while i was here- i get a message when people are banned
25-10-2019T00:57:22,JojoF2415,I couldn’t chat for the whole week. I can see streams but never saw my name in user
25-10-2019T00:57:31,SageSaga,when did it start?
25-10-2019T00:57:36,JojoF2415,Sunday
25-10-2019T00:57:48,SageSaga,so you were banned on Tom's stream probably
25-10-2019T00:58:08,JojoF2415,I don’t even know how I got banned in his stream
25-10-2019T00:58:27,SageSaga,its very common for people who get banned to suddenly forget why they were banned
25-10-2019T00:58:38,Ordithus,I don't remember even doing any mod things that day
25-10-2019T00:58:46,Ordithus,"Or anyone, for that matter"
25-10-2019T00:58:48,JojoF2415,No I clearly remembered what happened in that day
25-10-2019T00:59:06,SageSaga,if you did you would know why you were banned

25-10-2019T01:11:34,SageSaga,glad ya enjoyed it
25-10-2019T01:12:00,JojoF2415,I was into anime but I just like to draw it right now.
25-10-2019T01:14:42,SageSaga,i finished 2 of the books i picked up recently
25-10-2019T01:14:48,JojoF2415,I was playing this game. The same reason why I got 172 bpm. Wednesday I had my hand on top of my heart.
25-10-2019T01:14:59,JojoF2415,I felt something there
25-10-2019T01:15:33,Ordithus,Which books were these?
25-10-2019T01:15:33,SageSaga,have ya been to the doctor?
25-10-2019T01:15:46,SageSaga,i got Ascendance of a Bookworm which was great
25-10-2019T01:15:57,SageSaga,the other book i finished was I shall Survive Using Potions-
25-10-2019T01:16:01,SageSaga,and that was...
25-10-2019T01:16:11,SageSaga,ok but had some major writing flaws
25-10-2019T01:16:21,JojoF2415,No but I feel fine. There was a dude who went to the emergency room playing the game I’m playing.
25-10-2019T01:16:39,SageSaga,what game?
25-10-2019T01:16:50,JojoF2415,Geometry Dash
25-10-2019T01:17:25,JojoF2415,I’m taking a break from it
25-10-2019T01:18:11,SageSaga,I wonder if my review on Amazon is visible
25-10-2019T01:18:16,JojoF2415,I should be sleeping right now
25-10-2019T01:19:56,SageSaga,https://smile.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2U8FTIPWSOG3S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07MHW9QY4
25-10-2019T01:20:01,SageSaga,does that link work?
25-10-2019T01:20:09,Ordithus,yes
25-10-2019T01:20:10,JojoF2415,ill Check
25-10-2019T01:20:52,JojoF2415,Yeah
25-10-2019T01:21:04,SageSaga,that should explain the issues i had with the book
25-10-2019T01:21:43,JojoF2415,I got a shelf full of mangas
25-10-2019T01:22:33,Ordithus,"Bookworm looked pretty cute from the trailer, maaybe I'll actually give it a try"
25-10-2019T01:23:57,SageSaga,https://smile.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2JUAM2L3T47HE?ref=pf_ov_at_pdctrvw_srp
25-10-2019T01:24:03,SageSaga,my review on Bookworm
25-10-2019T01:25:41,SageSaga,the crazy part is - that book - it says on Amazon it is 33 pages long
25-10-2019T01:25:46,SageSaga,it isnt
25-10-2019T01:25:54,SageSaga,it is actually 450 pages long
25-10-2019T01:27:03,SageSaga,and thats book 1 part 3- so book 1 all together is about 1000+ pages
25-10-2019T01:27:09,JojoF2415,My body is sore
25-10-2019T01:27:26,Ordithus,that's a big book
25-10-2019T01:27:40,JojoF2415,Man that’s huge
25-10-2019T01:27:57,SageSaga,Book 2 part 1 comes out next month- already preordered it
25-10-2019T01:28:31,JojoF2415,I have to enjoy the weekend because I have exams next week
25-10-2019T01:28:50,JojoF2415,Oh wait I have to study so never mind
25-10-2019T01:28:55,SageSaga,i cant enjoy weekends because i work all weekend
25-10-2019T01:29:15,SageSaga,i get one bit of fun though on Saturday nights but even that is work
25-10-2019T01:29:27,JojoF2415,I work with my dad in the weekends. Then I have school
25-10-2019T01:29:49,JojoF2415,I really don’t care about art class
25-10-2019T01:30:02,JojoF2415,I’m failing government
25-10-2019T01:30:45,SageSaga,you should not do that
25-10-2019T01:31:00,JojoF2415,I have a b in government
25-10-2019T01:31:12,JojoF2415,I’m used to As
25-10-2019T01:31:12,Ordithus,A B isn't failing
25-10-2019T01:31:14,SageSaga,sounds like you just lied then
25-10-2019T01:31:25,JojoF2415,I don’t like bs
25-10-2019T01:31:31,SageSaga,no wonder you got banned
25-10-2019T01:31:48,JojoF2415,B as in the letter grade
25-10-2019T01:31:56,SageSaga,i know
25-10-2019T01:32:30,JojoF2415,I wasn’t talking about grades though. I said what do you prefer tacos or pizza
25-10-2019T01:32:55,SageSaga,so you do remember why you were banned
25-10-2019T01:33:26,JojoF2415,it was only once
25-10-2019T01:33:40,Ordithus,Taco pizza... the one pizza I don't like
25-10-2019T01:33:49,SageSaga,you lied twice now o_o
25-10-2019T01:34:24,Ordithus,I remember this now.  I don't remember a ban though
25-10-2019T01:35:31,JojoF2415,nothing adds up to me why I got banned
25-10-2019T01:37:39,SageSaga,my guess is your random comments make it seem like you are fishing for conversation rather than joining the conversation
25-10-2019T01:37:50,SageSaga,people find that really annoying sometimes and can be a form of spam
25-10-2019T01:38:05,JojoF2415,Ahh ok
25-10-2019T01:38:39,SageSaga,"like lets say yall are talking about the latest comic page and i hop on and i say ""hey"" ""What shoe size is everyone?"""
25-10-2019T01:38:56,JojoF2415,I get it now
25-10-2019T01:39:58,JojoF2415,I kinda know why the reason I got banned
25-10-2019T01:41:26,Ordithus,"Speaking of comics, is teleportation common?"
25-10-2019T01:42:27,SageSaga,it used to be but the network is broken without the mages guild network
25-10-2019T01:42:41,Ordithus,how inconvenient
25-10-2019T01:43:03,SageSaga,any decent mage can cast a teleport spell from a scroll though
25-10-2019T01:43:22,SageSaga,and those scrolls used to be very common so they are still around- just not many who can use them
25-10-2019T01:45:26,JojoF2415,I got lost in the part where I think his name is Kevin. Where he went VR. I got lost there
25-10-2019T01:45:26,SageSaga,there's also a big difference between cities and kingdoms- some are just getting by like Rosestone and then there are some that are thriving
25-10-2019T01:45:53,SageSaga,what made you get lost?
25-10-2019T01:46:45,Ordithus,"Teleportation is great for players of a game, so that makes sense"
25-10-2019T01:47:03,JojoF2415,I have to re read it again
25-10-2019T01:47:13,SageSaga,Rosestone was right next to a monster infested forest... so they didnt have much luck
25-10-2019T01:48:02,SageSaga,im looking forward to the mountain city- that will be fun
25-10-2019T01:48:21,Ordithus,Mountains! :ptv-excited:
25-10-2019T01:48:49,Sclimshady,Like built into the mountain?
25-10-2019T01:49:26,SageSaga,into and ontop of
25-10-2019T01:49:46,JojoF2415,Is this about your web comic sage?
25-10-2019T01:49:52,Sclimshady,Neat :eyes:
25-10-2019T01:49:53,SageSaga,but thats much later- this one they are going to is in the sprawling plains
25-10-2019T01:49:57,SageSaga,yes Jojo
25-10-2019T01:50:27,JojoF2415,Sorry I have to re read it just to understand the whole concept.
25-10-2019T01:51:23,SageSaga,its no problem
25-10-2019T01:52:22,JojoF2415,I just get confused in what everyone is talking about. Everything is new to me
25-10-2019T01:52:54,SageSaga,just talking about the future of the comic
25-10-2019T01:53:13,JojoF2415,Yeah it happens with twokinds as well
25-10-2019T01:53:25,Sclimshady,Nyna has the best faces
25-10-2019T01:53:40,SageSaga,this new chapter has a new Character that kinda joins the group

25-10-2019T02:05:22,SageSaga,*song
25-10-2019T02:05:44,KDDT,That would be nice.
25-10-2019T02:07:21,SageSaga,"i would say ""So far every Isekai they have done a song for has been good!"" but that was not true last season XD"

25-10-2019T14:15:43,BadXAsh,Those hooks aren't sterilized either so... I'm probably giving them tetanus as well.
25-10-2019T14:16:29,SageSaga,im sure the local hospitals are used to it by now and treat for it if they escape
25-10-2019T14:18:46,SageSaga,hmm at some point i need Kaylin to go to a village with dark elves so she can join them in the Dance of the Full Moon
25-10-2019T14:20:59,BadXAsh,There's always reasons to go to a village.
25-10-2019T14:21:01,BadXAsh,Beer
25-10-2019T14:21:17,SageSaga,Elven villages arent known for their beer
25-10-2019T14:22:01,BadXAsh,OH! Elven...
25-10-2019T14:22:05,BadXAsh,Wine
25-10-2019T14:22:16,BadXAsh,Wine and Song
25-10-2019T14:22:27,SageSaga,Kaylin loves her wine -
25-10-2019T14:24:08,SageSaga,Kaylin though will probably just want to go to the Dance to show off her naked dancing skills
25-10-2019T14:25:02,SageSaga,"Kaylin - ""I need to go pray!"" Nyna - ""riiiiight"""
25-10-2019T14:38:03,SageSaga,pretty good progress for 38 minutes
25-10-2019T14:41:22,ZoieFalcona,"Well, plenty of cute girls over there"
25-10-2019T14:41:40,SageSaga,yo Zoie!
25-10-2019T14:41:47,ZoieFalcona,Heyoo :3
25-10-2019T14:42:06,Sclimshady,Hello o/
25-10-2019T14:42:20,SageSaga,y oSclim
25-10-2019T14:42:27,SageSaga,<_< Yo*
25-10-2019T14:42:33,Sclimshady,Yo-Yo
25-10-2019T14:48:31,SageSaga,o_o am i going to finish this comic in under 2 hours?
25-10-2019T14:49:00,ZoieFalcona,"for some reason my mind jumped to Lupin the 3rd with the music, but it isn't..... and ya just might."
25-10-2019T14:49:27,SageSaga,this music is from Cop Craft
25-10-2019T14:49:34,SageSaga,highly recommended
25-10-2019T14:51:13,SageSaga,"is this music ""Big band"" style?"
25-10-2019T14:53:12,SageSaga,not the current song btw-
25-10-2019T14:53:17,SageSaga,not sure if anyone caught it
25-10-2019T14:54:18,Sclimshady,I have audio off
25-10-2019T14:54:21,Sclimshady,so no
25-10-2019T14:54:28,ZoieFalcona,I wouldn't call it big band... more what I expect from 70s cop shows
25-10-2019T14:55:46,ZoieFalcona,though this one is more of a waltz
25-10-2019T14:56:02,SageSaga,well that's kinda accurate then seeing as it is basically a cop show + elves
25-10-2019T14:56:41,ZoieFalcona,"Okay, now that is a bit of a twist."
25-10-2019T14:57:12,Sclimshady,I want to watch a fantasy cop show :eyes:
25-10-2019T14:57:23,SageSaga,Here is the opening for Cop Craft - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImE5s4QIglc
25-10-2019T14:59:39,Sclimshady,Whack
25-10-2019T15:05:12,ZoieFalcona,"*stretches* slowly getting the girls ready for the town's ""trunk or treat"" so Grey can do something with em this year"
25-10-2019T15:06:30,SageSaga,trunk or treat sounds dangerous
25-10-2019T15:07:09,Sclimshady,"Its a gamble,  Candy...or kidnapping?"
25-10-2019T15:07:25,SageSaga,see?
25-10-2019T15:07:42,ZoieFalcona,-.-  No...
25-10-2019T15:08:44,ZoieFalcona,"it's at the community center where everyone parks their car in the parking lot there, make it all halloweeny lookin and do trick or treat that way."
25-10-2019T15:09:03,SageSaga,ah
25-10-2019T15:09:26,SageSaga,we dont have that around here
25-10-2019T15:09:54,ZoieFalcona,basically to make those parents who are too scared to take their kids out at night in their neighborhood to somewhere safe and controled
25-10-2019T15:10:22,SageSaga,but the scary houses are the ones that give out full sized candy bars...
25-10-2019T15:11:00,Sclimshady,We do that because the houses are too far apart and you get kinda shot if you walk up to houses without an invite
25-10-2019T15:11:05,ZoieFalcona,"Grey calls it ""halloween for hypercontrolled mommies"""
25-10-2019T15:12:00,ZoieFalcona,Grey is huge into halloween but I have to stop him because the churches around here are quite... passionate of their hatred of it and give their own autumn festival stuff to counteract it.
25-10-2019T15:12:24,SageSaga,my old neighborhood had a few homes that had really long driveways that took you into the forest- and the people would setup spooky decorations all in the forest along the path in
25-10-2019T15:12:49,SageSaga,and they always had big candy bars
25-10-2019T15:13:16,ZoieFalcona,Grey says there is one neighborhood in town that gone all out and one yard has a full haunted house feel as if ya went to busch gardens scare zones
25-10-2019T15:13:39,SageSaga,you mean Hallowscream
25-10-2019T15:14:12,ZoieFalcona,Howl-o-scream?  yes.  I was talking about the particular zones where they had the walk throughs where people would scare ya
25-10-2019T15:14:13,SageSaga,?*
25-10-2019T15:14:20,Sclimshady,KC has some real good haunted houses in the abandoned factory district.  One has a real alligator
25-10-2019T15:14:29,SageSaga,i thought they just called those haunted houses
25-10-2019T15:14:38,SageSaga,its been a while since ive been able to go
25-10-2019T15:15:02,SageSaga,it sucks living really close to such a theme park and just never having the time or money to go T_T
25-10-2019T15:15:23,ZoieFalcona,"Welll,, they changed it as to not be limited by themes.  The last time Grey and I went they had a warzone meltdown, the nurses/dr freaknstien with a clinic gone wrong, and more"
25-10-2019T15:15:52,SageSaga,I forget where you live-
25-10-2019T15:16:08,ZoieFalcona,"N. Carolina, about 3 hours away from ya"
25-10-2019T15:16:59,SageSaga,ah
25-10-2019T15:17:03,ZoieFalcona,the last time we went was before Lilly was born when Hurricane Matthew struck.
25-10-2019T15:17:59,SageSaga,is it weird that at some point we may have walked by eachother and not known it?
25-10-2019T15:18:01,ZoieFalcona,a normal 3 hour trip home turned into 14 as we couldn't go across the bridges due to damage and had to go up the peninsula with many of the low roads flooded
25-10-2019T15:18:34,ZoieFalcona,Maybe.  We did stay at one of the hotels there. Really nice restarant next to it too.
25-10-2019T15:22:17,SageSaga,jeez im almost done-
25-10-2019T15:22:18,FoxxTrotter,:cfoxxtrotter-FoxEye:

25-10-2019T23:47:43,AspiringNoodle,I spent 4.5 - 5 hours today just checking expiration dates (and not even finishing) on products
25-10-2019T23:48:00,AspiringNoodle,I found stuff that had expired as far back as January...
25-10-2019T23:48:13,AspiringNoodle,"Our store is ""properly staffed"" though... my ass it is -_-"
25-10-2019T23:52:44,AspiringNoodle,I wish for all retail employees who want to to escape and get better jobs
25-10-2019T23:52:55,AspiringNoodle,Because we all know corporate doesn't deserve its success :p
