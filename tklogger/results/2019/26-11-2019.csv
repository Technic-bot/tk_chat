26-11-2019T11:37:10,ThingsAreMoving,"Not a good day at work, but it had it's highlights I guess. Most equipment wasn't working, and we were running the machinery at very slow pace. Then one of the managers comes over and happily asks me how's it going. I was like, ""fucking terrible, man""."
26-11-2019T11:37:22,ThingsAreMoving,"He snickered and said that normally people tell him ""fine"" even if it's raining fire, and that he appreciated my honesty. tl;dr unintentionally got brownie points at work."
