06-09-2019T00:35:19,Mihari,I missing kiting glavs as a cat :(
06-09-2019T00:35:20,ZRO4825,"Nah. I made the mistake of going Long Sword instead of my Charge Blade, lol"
06-09-2019T00:35:20,SageSaga,"poke poke block poke poke block counter block, poke poke poke"
06-09-2019T00:36:24,SageSaga,hellblade Glav was hard- those i needed Mihari cating it to death
06-09-2019T00:37:36,Mihari,I was a god tier cat :(
06-09-2019T00:38:13,SageSaga,i know they added a ton of hunter animations to the Cats in the update- so im hoping modders can use that and add Prowlers in
06-09-2019T00:40:18,ZRO4825,"I'll be better once I've learned his attacks. Fresh as fresh can be on fighting him right now, lol."
06-09-2019T00:40:59,SageSaga,i watched a couple of Narga hunts- looks pretty easy
06-09-2019T00:41:10,SageSaga,very similar to how he was in Gen
06-09-2019T00:42:34,ZRO4825,"Honestly, yeah, Narga is I think."
06-09-2019T00:42:49,ZRO4825,Barioth's a bit harder imo
06-09-2019T00:43:43,SageSaga,Barioth is just slightly more advanced not as good looking Ice Narga
06-09-2019T00:45:54,ZRO4825,"Breath attack hits a pretty wide range when he uses it, had trouble getting out of it if I wasn't running before it launched. I don't have those i-frame instincts you guys have, lol"
06-09-2019T00:47:39,SageSaga,not looking forward to Savage Jho
06-09-2019T00:48:51,SageSaga,Dragon beam is fine- it's that giant cloud that im worried about
06-09-2019T00:54:40,ZRO4825,"Main trouble I have is seeing the tells. I need a farther out camera, lmao."
06-09-2019T00:55:42,SageSaga,it was easier on 3Ds because they put so many tells in the legs of the really big monsters
06-09-2019T00:55:53,SageSaga,3DS
06-09-2019T00:57:25,SageSaga,"""Jho takes a step back and then plants his feet"" ""Breath attack!"" ""Jho lifts leg"" ""Stomp tremor!"" ""Jho stands still"" ""hes hungry!"""

06-09-2019T00:58:28,ZRO4825,G'night Anu
06-09-2019T00:58:44,ZRO4825,And I feel like they made a lot of the monsters bigger in World than they were in other games from what I've seen.
06-09-2019T01:00:20,SageSaga,i thought smaller-
06-09-2019T01:01:36,ZRO4825,"I remember seeing vids of a Rathian from GU and going ""Wow, it's so tiny..."" lol"
06-09-2019T01:04:25,SageSaga,could be a gold crown small Rathian
06-09-2019T01:04:54,SageSaga,Comic i like with Brachydios http://i.imgur.com/cNe6K9u.jpg
06-09-2019T01:11:26,ZRO4825,lol
06-09-2019T01:13:50,ZRO4825,"Yeah. Just lost my first fight with Glav after 45 minutes, lol."
06-09-2019T01:14:16,ZRO4825,Might just be a defense issue for now. I've been kinda resisting moving up to MR gear.
06-09-2019T01:14:42,SageSaga,that's a mistake
06-09-2019T01:15:18,SageSaga,isnt most MR low end gear like 200 Def points above the highest HR gear?
06-09-2019T01:15:29,ZRO4825,"Nah, only about 40-50 per piece"
06-09-2019T01:15:40,ZRO4825,"Well, yes/no, depending on if you mean per set or per piece, lol"
06-09-2019T01:15:48,SageSaga,per set obviously
06-09-2019T01:16:18,ZRO4825,"I don't think in sets, lol. No set has ever had a bonus that felt like it was worth building towards so I've been using mixed sets forever XD"
06-09-2019T01:18:00,SageSaga,a mixed set is still a whole set
06-09-2019T01:19:27,ZRO4825,Also I hate losing my earplugs setups. :joy:
06-09-2019T01:19:54,ZRO4825,"Gotten more used to running without them lately, but the new monsters I'm not used to them enough to know when to at least make attempts to roll the roars, lol"
06-09-2019T01:20:28,SageSaga,i havent looked into the new gems yet so i hope the old gems are still good XD
06-09-2019T01:21:22,SageSaga,i also hope its not big on research points because im low on them - but i have like 20 billion zenny
06-09-2019T01:21:25,ZRO4825,"The new gems are....odd. They're either 2 ranks of the old gems, or, they're a combo gem of like, Mushroomancer and Attack, or something of that sort. Giving 1 rank of each."
06-09-2019T01:22:26,SageSaga,is it random?
06-09-2019T01:22:40,ZRO4825,Not completely sure yet.
06-09-2019T01:23:00,SageSaga,=_=; did decorations turn into old Talismen? XD
06-09-2019T01:23:06,ZRO4825,Perhaps? o_o
06-09-2019T01:23:08,ZRO4825,idk!

06-09-2019T01:24:30,ZRO4825,"I noticed that in GU, was lookin through some stuff and was like ""Wait, this has NEGATIVES?!?"" lmao"
06-09-2019T01:26:36,SageSaga,if they are random - i hope they have a melder combiner option
06-09-2019T01:26:48,SageSaga,so i can take all my attack gems and crit gems and combine them O_O
06-09-2019T01:27:49,ZRO4825,"lol, well, I haven't seen that option yet."
06-09-2019T01:28:04,ZRO4825,And what attack gems? The only attack gems that exist are the freebies that get handed out. XD
06-09-2019T01:28:36,SageSaga,i have like 10 now
06-09-2019T01:29:08,ZRO4825,"Must be nice, lol"
06-09-2019T01:29:30,SageSaga,just farm giant Lava boy when he's in the events
06-09-2019T01:30:04,ZRO4825,"Would rather fight Fat Jagras. I detest Lavasioth, lol"
06-09-2019T01:30:29,SageSaga,someone posted a way to farm him and kill him super fast-
06-09-2019T01:43:47,SageSaga,oh-
06-09-2019T01:44:24,SageSaga,i forgot to mention- someone commented on the last AI comic that made me kinda scratch my head a bit and laugh
06-09-2019T01:45:51,SageSaga,not sure if anyone that is still around cares to hear about it though XD
06-09-2019T01:47:24,ZRO4825,Palicoes are glitchin out a bit. They'll start to pull out a Vigorwasp to fly to you...and suddenly it just disappears.
06-09-2019T01:57:31,RimaDraws,i care
06-09-2019T01:58:41,SageSaga,this guy commented saying Kaylin was being a bit of a dick towards the high elf
06-09-2019T01:59:26,ZRO4825,lol
06-09-2019T01:59:30,SageSaga,and im like- yeah i totally agree- she's being rude towards someone who has been extremely rude-
06-09-2019T01:59:59,RimaDraws,^
06-09-2019T02:00:03,SageSaga,"but he goes on to say Kaylin is being ""holier than thou"" towards her"
06-09-2019T02:00:40,SageSaga,"im just like ""Bro- she was just explaining everything wrong with every other race - except for hers- she even was like ""I am a high elf after all!"""
06-09-2019T02:01:41,SageSaga,"thats like me saying ""I should have shotgun when we get in the car- because im white"""
06-09-2019T02:02:42,SageSaga,however- what really confused me was
06-09-2019T02:03:01,SageSaga,"he kept calling Kaylin ""Kayla"""
06-09-2019T02:03:18,SageSaga,"and then called her ""he"""
06-09-2019T02:05:02,SageSaga,"so i was trying to understand this whole thing - and one of the things i came up with is- he didnt realize she was being super racist - he didnt see anything wrong with what the high elf was saying- he just sees a ""dark elf"" being angry at a ""high elf"" XD"
06-09-2019T02:08:11,SageSaga,o_o do y'all see why i think that's funny or is it just me?
06-09-2019T02:08:36,ZRO4825,Glav concentration @.@

06-09-2019T02:35:36,ZRO4825,":thinking: Moon elves? Figured that'd just be another name for Dark Elves, but it's a different race of them?"
06-09-2019T02:35:55,SageSaga,High elves are also called Sun Elves
06-09-2019T02:36:17,SageSaga,Moon Elves are fair skinned with silver-blue hair
06-09-2019T02:36:52,SageSaga,while Sun elves are fair skinned with blond-white-yellow and even some Red hair- and can have a bit tanner skin too
06-09-2019T02:37:18,SageSaga,but wood elves are often more tan skinned and have a variety of hair colors - usually all colors plants can be
06-09-2019T02:38:07,BadFoMo,I thought High Elves were called such because they came from Pot-Land.
06-09-2019T02:38:13,SageSaga,Dark elves are very simlar to moon elves in terms of culture on the surface but have white-black-and more exotic bluish colored hairs
06-09-2019T02:38:46,SageSaga,and Drow are subterranean Dark elves that i dont know if i can use in my comic or not XD

06-09-2019T02:59:33,SageSaga,"The question is, are subterranean dark elves a trademark owned by Wizards Of the Coast"
06-09-2019T03:01:09,SageSaga,"From what i can see the term Drow is not trademarked, but the concept of dark elves living underground might be copyright"

06-09-2019T16:03:36,Sclimshady,"I bought my engine there, it worked out pretty well"
06-09-2019T16:03:52,SageSaga,i bought 4 copies of windows there for like 15 bucks
06-09-2019T16:04:35,Sclimshady,"Dang, mine was bundled with my SSD for like 20"
06-09-2019T16:04:46,AnuSekaniArt,"I bought a couple of like new, rare games there for like $20"
06-09-2019T16:04:57,AnuSekaniArt,BRB
06-09-2019T16:05:16,RimaDraws,somehow i got two SSDs instead of just one
06-09-2019T16:05:24,SageSaga,size?
06-09-2019T16:05:24,RimaDraws,should i use the second one for an extra
06-09-2019T16:05:30,RimaDraws,240 GB each
06-09-2019T16:05:45,SageSaga,if they didnt charge you for it- heck yeah use it- if they did- depends on how much it cost
06-09-2019T16:05:51,RimaDraws,they didnt charge
06-09-2019T16:05:57,Sclimshady,You could run your most used programs and games on the extra
06-09-2019T16:06:01,RimaDraws,idk why they sent the extra with a book on family recovery
06-09-2019T16:06:02,RimaDraws,lol
06-09-2019T16:06:08,RimaDraws,like hey free shit
06-09-2019T16:06:13,SageSaga,what kinda SSD?
06-09-2019T16:06:47,RimaDraws,ugh you ask me that and now i gotta look it up
06-09-2019T16:06:54,ZRO4825,lol
06-09-2019T16:07:24,SageSaga,"ive got 2 HDDs, 2 SSDs, and 1 M.2 SSD"
06-09-2019T16:08:01,SageSaga,the m.2 is a Samsung which makes the best M.2 drives so far
06-09-2019T16:08:10,SageSaga,WD has good ones too
06-09-2019T16:08:17,RimaDraws,ADATA SU635 240GB  3D-NAND QLC SATA 2.5 inch internal SSD (ASU635SS-240GQ-R)
06-09-2019T16:08:25,RimaDraws,i have two of those mind you
06-09-2019T16:08:28,Sclimshady,"I didnt realize my computer downloaded stuff to the SSD even with my HDD as primary until it was full, so be careful about that"
06-09-2019T16:08:41,RimaDraws,one was only $29 and i got two
06-09-2019T16:09:07,SageSaga,that's cheep - i would be worried about their specs
06-09-2019T16:09:11,RimaDraws,and a 480 GB went for $48 on amazon
06-09-2019T16:09:13,SageSaga,cheap*
06-09-2019T16:09:22,ZRO4825,WD Black 500GB M.2 I'm running. Love that thing. <3
06-09-2019T16:09:25,RimaDraws,so i got two for 29$
06-09-2019T16:09:40,ZRO4825,Now I just need to actually get a good video card and my computer will be back to running tip-top shape.
06-09-2019T16:09:43,RimaDraws,i am keeping it plus my HDD is 1 TB
06-09-2019T16:09:44,Sclimshady,I think I paid 150 or so for my 120 gb
06-09-2019T16:10:03,SageSaga,i paid 200 for my 1TB M.2
06-09-2019T16:10:04,Sclimshady,this was a while ago though
06-09-2019T16:10:27,RimaDraws,my 1 TB was $32.50
06-09-2019T16:10:34,AnuSekaniArt,I have 2 HDDs and 1 M.2 Samsung
06-09-2019T16:10:48,AnuSekaniArt,The M.2 is 500 gigs and cost me about $90
06-09-2019T16:11:16,AnuSekaniArt,"Yeah I know the feel ZRO, I put my PC together a couple of weeks ago finally"
06-09-2019T16:11:19,AnuSekaniArt,It's a beast XD
06-09-2019T16:11:30,RimaDraws,i was kinda stoked i got two SSD
06-09-2019T16:11:37,AnuSekaniArt,Ryzen 7 3700X and an aftermarket cooled Radeon RX 5700 XT
06-09-2019T16:11:47,SageSaga,"Rima- my 1TB is a M.2 drive, for hard drives I have a WD Black 4TB and a WD Black 3TB"
06-09-2019T16:11:48,AnuSekaniArt,I need to get a SATA SSD I think
06-09-2019T16:11:56,RimaDraws,well sorry
06-09-2019T16:12:06,Sclimshady,Thas a lot of storage
06-09-2019T16:12:10,RimaDraws,i may switch it out later for a 2 or 3
06-09-2019T16:12:15,AnuSekaniArt,Oh wow Sage XD
06-09-2019T16:12:16,SageSaga,and 2 Sata SSDs
06-09-2019T16:12:26,RimaDraws,i dont heavy game
06-09-2019T16:12:29,SageSaga,these comics take up a lot of space
06-09-2019T16:12:36,AnuSekaniArt,I can imagine Sage
06-09-2019T16:12:37,Sclimshady,I bet
06-09-2019T16:12:48,ZRO4825,"Was gonna say, image editing can eat the hell out of hard drive space, lol."
06-09-2019T16:12:48,RimaDraws,well i will switch later. maybe just get a 4 TB
06-09-2019T16:13:10,ZRO4825,I'm plotting a WD Black 6TB for my Steam drive to be moved to here hopefully soon.
06-09-2019T16:13:13,SageSaga,my Comic folder is 180GBs
06-09-2019T16:13:50,RimaDraws,because you have so many
06-09-2019T16:14:05,RimaDraws,for now i am just wanting to start my pc. and i am actually excited
06-09-2019T16:14:08,ZRO4825,He's only got like 2500 pages in Yosh :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
06-09-2019T16:14:09,SageSaga,web versions and full res PSD/Clip files
06-09-2019T16:14:14,AnuSekaniArt,It's a great feeling Rima ^^
06-09-2019T16:15:50,RimaDraws,"yea i just want my pc. now i gotta figure how much else i gotta save for my keyboard, mouse, and headphones"
06-09-2019T16:16:41,AnuSekaniArt,Don't do what I did and go overboard on the keyboard XD
06-09-2019T16:17:13,RimaDraws,why not
06-09-2019T16:17:25,AnuSekaniArt,I spent $200 on my keyboard
06-09-2019T16:17:29,SageSaga,depends on if ya want a good set of headphones- you can get some really cheap- but i suggest going for something around 60-100
06-09-2019T16:17:43,AnuSekaniArt,Granted it's a stupidly nice keyboard but you don't need to spend $200 XD
06-09-2019T16:17:54,SageSaga,I think the head set i would recommend most people get is the HyperX Cloud2
06-09-2019T16:18:00,RimaDraws,i am only gonna spend $70 max
06-09-2019T16:18:01,AnuSekaniArt,"And yeah, that price range is pretty good for headphones. That's the set I have actually XD"
06-09-2019T16:18:05,RimaDraws,i already found one
06-09-2019T16:18:24,RimaDraws,i am going with corsair all the way
06-09-2019T16:18:36,AnuSekaniArt,Yeee Corsair's peripherals are nice
06-09-2019T16:18:51,AnuSekaniArt,I have a Sabre RGB mouse and a K95 Platinum keyboard
06-09-2019T16:18:55,Sclimshady,"Yeah, thats what I did and I love my stuff"
06-09-2019T16:19:01,AnuSekaniArt,Also have some of their Vengeance RAM
06-09-2019T16:19:43,Sclimshady,"Ngl, I spilled coffee on my keyboard. took it apart and cleaned it and it works like new"
06-09-2019T16:19:52,AnuSekaniArt,That would freak me out XD
06-09-2019T16:20:05,Sclimshady,It got really in there too
06-09-2019T16:21:32,RimaDraws,@Sagesaga what buyer did you get yours from? your OS
06-09-2019T16:21:35,Sclimshady,She has the surprised Pikachu face going on
06-09-2019T16:23:42,SageSaga,doesnt really matter all that much Rima - the majority of them have bought codes from overstocked companies or even companies that have gone out of business but had like tons of Windows 7/8 codes that they got upgrade codes for but never used
06-09-2019T16:24:36,SageSaga,worse case scenario on ebay when buying one - you get a code that doesnt work- you tell them it doesnt work- they send you a new one- if that doesnt work- you get a refund
06-09-2019T16:25:22,SageSaga,your computer will still work without a code for a while too
06-09-2019T16:25:41,AnuSekaniArt,"You'll just have an ""Activate Windows"" watermark in the lower right, right?"
06-09-2019T16:25:43,SageSaga,just make sure you have or you make a Windows 10 Flash drive
06-09-2019T16:25:46,RimaDraws,oh yea. i saw one for $28.50 and thats windows 10 pro
06-09-2019T16:25:47,SageSaga,yeah
06-09-2019T16:25:59,SageSaga,you should be able to find one much cheaper
06-09-2019T16:26:09,RimaDraws,what size flash drive would i need
06-09-2019T16:26:45,Nekonny,o/
06-09-2019T16:27:05,Sclimshady,Hi Ron o/
06-09-2019T16:27:15,Nekonny,heya sage everyone
06-09-2019T16:27:24,Nekonny,*and everyone
06-09-2019T16:27:26,AnuSekaniArt,Heeey Ron :D
06-09-2019T16:27:35,BadFoMo,Yo.
06-09-2019T16:27:53,FoxxTrotter,"Hi, Ron."
06-09-2019T16:27:55,SageSaga,yo Ron
06-09-2019T16:28:03,SageSaga,im almost done
06-09-2019T16:28:03,RimaDraws,hi ron
06-09-2019T16:28:23,Nekonny,"Ah ,ok"
06-09-2019T16:28:33,Nekonny,I'll keep everyone entertained XD
06-09-2019T16:28:33,AnuSekaniArt,Looking great as always Sage :)
06-09-2019T16:28:55,RimaDraws,sage i found another with just the key license for $5
06-09-2019T16:29:09,Nekonny,windows 10?
06-09-2019T16:29:11,RimaDraws,yea
06-09-2019T16:29:12,RimaDraws,pro
06-09-2019T16:29:15,Nekonny,nice
06-09-2019T16:29:19,RimaDraws,64 bit on ebay
06-09-2019T16:29:27,SageSaga,Rima- i think 8GBs
06-09-2019T16:29:31,Nekonny,I'll probably need to get one or two of those in the future myself
06-09-2019T16:29:39,RimaDraws,i think thats a snag. also i will get an 8GB
06-09-2019T16:29:43,AnuSekaniArt,Just be prepared to download an assload of updates XD
06-09-2019T16:30:06,AnuSekaniArt,"Got my PC built and it had a lot of issues, all stemming from the fact I was missing crucial Windows updates lol"
06-09-2019T16:30:11,RimaDraws,alot of good reviews on the product too
06-09-2019T16:30:21,SageSaga,it says 8GB minimum so i would get a bigger one - they are pretty cheap anyways
06-09-2019T16:30:30,RimaDraws,i will get a 16GB then
06-09-2019T16:30:35,RimaDraws,make sure i got enough soace
06-09-2019T16:30:36,RimaDraws,space
06-09-2019T16:30:37,RimaDraws,omg
06-09-2019T16:31:04,RimaDraws,why spend $120 on a pro key on amazon or walmart when you get it on ebay cheaper
06-09-2019T16:31:27,Nekonny,is it legit tho?
06-09-2019T16:31:47,RimaDraws,um do you want me to link
06-09-2019T16:32:54,SageSaga,"they are legit codes Ron, because of the free update a ton of businesses and such got thousands of free codes and didnt upgrade- so people bought them up in bulk and resell them now"
06-09-2019T16:33:18,RimaDraws,i am snagging this because that is a deal
06-09-2019T16:33:26,Nekonny,ah I see
06-09-2019T16:33:55,SageSaga,"also at 3 dollars for a code it's worth the near non-existent ""risk"""
06-09-2019T16:34:30,RimaDraws,so sage just saved me a ton of money. thanks sage
06-09-2019T16:34:49,SageSaga,np
06-09-2019T16:34:52,RimaDraws,^^
06-09-2019T16:34:52,AnuSekaniArt,I probs should have done that
06-09-2019T16:35:03,ZRO4825,"Hmmm...need to go get dinner, eat dinner, and then get back to trying to kick Tigrex's ass."
06-09-2019T16:35:07,AnuSekaniArt,Instead I spent $140 at Best Buy for a Windows 10 Home license XD
06-09-2019T16:35:44,SageSaga,did it come with a USB?
06-09-2019T16:35:55,AnuSekaniArt,Yeah
06-09-2019T16:35:56,RimaDraws,i didnt buy yet let me see
06-09-2019T16:36:02,RimaDraws,oh
06-09-2019T16:36:03,AnuSekaniArt,Came on a Windows 10 USB
06-09-2019T16:36:13,SageSaga,so you had less work to do
06-09-2019T16:36:16,SageSaga,:P
06-09-2019T16:36:20,Nekonny,bonus usb
06-09-2019T16:36:34,AnuSekaniArt,Fair but is that worth an extra $100+? XD
06-09-2019T16:36:37,SageSaga,not sure its worth 140 dollars to avoid like 20 minutes of work
06-09-2019T16:36:44,Sclimshady,One expensive usb
06-09-2019T16:37:12,AnuSekaniArt,Yeah it wasn't lol
06-09-2019T16:38:03,SageSaga,Rima- there are instructions on Windows website on how to make a windows 10 USB- it will have ya download a program that will do most of the work
06-09-2019T16:38:23,SageSaga,it's worth taking the time to read over it and make sure you do it all right though
06-09-2019T16:38:47,SageSaga,it's not hard- it's just not something you should try to blast through clicking yes :P
06-09-2019T16:38:49,Mihari,"bear in mind that it's also windows home, which I wouldn't recommend over pro to anyone XD"
06-09-2019T16:39:03,ZRO4825,"Always go Pro when it comes to Windows, lol"
06-09-2019T16:39:19,Nekonny,eh... jumping back and forth between windows is too distracting T_T
06-09-2019T16:39:31,SageSaga,cept Windows 8
06-09-2019T16:39:41,Mihari,We don't talk about that.
06-09-2019T16:39:44,AnuSekaniArt,I got Win 10 Home ;_;
06-09-2019T16:39:45,ZRO4825,I thought the general basis was to just avoid 8 in general?
06-09-2019T16:40:15,RimaDraws,so wow amazon has a 10 pack of 16gb usbs for $30
06-09-2019T16:40:17,RimaDraws,nice
06-09-2019T16:40:42,SageSaga,Anu - Upgrade to pro for like 3 bucks? XD
06-09-2019T16:40:46,ZRO4825,Why would you need 10 of them though? o.o;
06-09-2019T16:40:48,RimaDraws,32gb 10 pack is 2 dollars more
06-09-2019T16:40:50,RimaDraws,idk
06-09-2019T16:40:58,BadFoMo,I'm sticking with Windows 7 for as long as I can.
06-09-2019T16:41:00,ZRO4825,"Like, pay a few bucks more and just get a 64gb one or something. XD"
06-09-2019T16:41:01,RimaDraws,i need one to have for my windows pro
06-09-2019T16:41:07,Sclimshady,To download the world
06-09-2019T16:41:09,AnuSekaniArt,I'll look into it Sage XD
06-09-2019T16:42:22,RimaDraws,i might just get those so i can use them for school or saving comic pages. cause i mean. they take alot of space
06-09-2019T16:43:04,SageSaga,im done!
06-09-2019T16:43:09,RimaDraws,nice sage
06-09-2019T16:43:12,RimaDraws,great work
06-09-2019T16:43:14,Sclimshady,Nice Sage!
06-09-2019T16:43:17,FoxxTrotter,Kewlness. :0)
06-09-2019T16:43:28,AnuSekaniArt,Excellent work as always Sage :D
06-09-2019T16:43:29,SageSaga,im not done!
06-09-2019T16:43:37,Sclimshady,Wat?
06-09-2019T16:43:38,RimaDraws,wait what
06-09-2019T16:43:45,SageSaga,XD
06-09-2019T16:43:53,SageSaga,i realized i can do something quick that will help
06-09-2019T16:44:10,AnuSekaniArt,XD
06-09-2019T16:44:40,RimaDraws,oh shadows
06-09-2019T16:46:01,SageSaga,there we go
06-09-2019T16:46:13,AnuSekaniArt,Excellent work Sage <3
06-09-2019T16:46:34,SageSaga,now they look more like they are in the scene and not on a separate layer over a background
06-09-2019T16:46:38,AnuSekaniArt,"Love the lighting on this one, it really shows on Kaylin's muscles especially ^^"
06-09-2019T16:46:50,Sclimshady,She stronk :csagesaga-kaylinheart:
06-09-2019T16:46:51,SageSaga,Kaylin is ripped
06-09-2019T16:47:13,SageSaga,she can bench press Nyna... but thats not really difficult- i could probably do that
06-09-2019T16:48:01,AnuSekaniArt,XD
06-09-2019T16:48:22,Sclimshady,Makes the home life more intertesting
06-09-2019T16:48:42,SageSaga,her strength score isnt super high but its very high compared to most humans and elves she's met so far
06-09-2019T16:49:05,SageSaga,Her Dex and Charisma scores though-
06-09-2019T16:49:21,AnuSekaniArt,Through the roof I bet XD
06-09-2019T16:49:32,Sclimshady,Those are the ones that matter though
06-09-2019T16:49:33,SageSaga,there's a reason the lie she tells about Nyna being a Demihuman is just always excepted without question
06-09-2019T16:50:01,AnuSekaniArt,Proficiency in deception as well as Charisma? :P
06-09-2019T16:50:22,SageSaga,Effectively yes- but this doesnt use D&D Rules exactly XD

06-09-2019T16:51:07,SageSaga,she does have the Silver tongue feature
06-09-2019T16:51:55,SageSaga,its always been her strongest point- being able to talk people into and talk her way out of stuff
06-09-2019T16:52:15,AnuSekaniArt,Very useful ^^
06-09-2019T16:52:32,SageSaga,though that's even more reason she was upset she couldnt talk her way into Relm's skirt (Because Relm doesnt often wear pants)
06-09-2019T16:52:48,AnuSekaniArt,Can't win them all XD

06-09-2019T16:54:30,FoxxTrotter,"C-ya, Sage. Thanks for the stream."
06-09-2019T16:56:24,BadFoMo,GAA! Sage posted a link without telling what it was first! He broke the rules! He betrayed the LAW!
06-09-2019T16:56:34,Nekonny,laaaawwwwww
06-09-2019T20:11:27,SomeNiceUser,I somehow read an entire webcomic in 4 hours.
06-09-2019T20:16:18,SomeNiceUser,Ima go read another webcomic.
06-09-2019T20:27:07,SpazztasticKiwi,God bless this little newish guy at work
06-09-2019T20:27:23,SpazztasticKiwi,heâ€™s so hyper and excited he reminds me of a golden retriever
06-09-2019T20:27:55,SpazztasticKiwi,"I could adopt him but at the same time, I want to know where that energy comes from"
06-09-2019T20:51:31,FloofyCat,They've either hit very few hurdles in life which gives them the energy or they're coming from a shitty situation and this is a massive deal for them and is uplifting them a great deal so they have all the energy in the world to try and make this work.
06-09-2019T21:09:29,AspiringNoodle,"Omg, this is priceless"
06-09-2019T21:09:58,AspiringNoodle,EA landed itself in the Guinness Book of World Records for its worst reddit post ever :ptv-laugh:
06-09-2019T21:34:24,SomeNiceUser,Priceless indeed Noodle.
06-09-2019T21:46:15,AspiringNoodle,This is how sad it is
06-09-2019T21:46:29,AspiringNoodle,The 2nd most downvoted post on reddit only has ~89k downvotes
06-09-2019T21:46:37,AspiringNoodle,EA's post still has a solid 600k downvote lead
06-09-2019T21:46:44,AspiringNoodle,It might be DECADES before this is broken
06-09-2019T22:09:35,Sclimshady,"Man, you gotta know you messed up after that"
06-09-2019T22:28:07,AspiringNoodle,"Nope, it's EA"
06-09-2019T22:28:15,AspiringNoodle,They'll just keep going on like nothing happened
06-09-2019T22:28:30,AspiringNoodle,"And anytime they have bad publicity, they will never blame any single person, make no major changes"
06-09-2019T22:28:41,AspiringNoodle,They'll just keep going until they're forced to change or die :ptv-hearts:
06-09-2019T22:31:42,AspiringNoodle,Goodnight everybody
06-09-2019T22:31:55,AspiringNoodle,Time to enjoy the fact that I can sleep for more than an hour at a time again
06-09-2019T22:32:00,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-sleepy:
