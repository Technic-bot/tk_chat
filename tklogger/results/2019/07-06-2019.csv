07-06-2019T00:17:22,ArkanaCat,Intersting size difference
07-06-2019T00:18:01,SpinoSpiritNinja,^
07-06-2019T00:18:02,AFallingTree,i legit wish i could draw. not because i can't but because i dont have the time to practice
07-06-2019T00:18:25,SpinoSpiritNinja,"I cant,i dont have good supplies"
07-06-2019T00:18:29,RimaDraws,I’ve been trying to find time between work to practice
07-06-2019T00:18:51,AFallingTree,you can pick up a cheap graphic tab for like $30
07-06-2019T00:19:03,SpinoSpiritNinja,Woah really
07-06-2019T00:19:12,AFallingTree,yeah i work 3 jobs and am trying to get a major
07-06-2019T00:19:15,Mippy,"Spino, all you need is a pencil and a pice of paper. You don’t need expensive stuff to art"
07-06-2019T00:19:18,SpinoSpiritNinja,I thought they all costed in the hundreds
07-06-2019T00:19:27,AFallingTree,"yep, theres plenty of good ones on amazon"
07-06-2019T00:19:42,SpazztasticKiwi,So I might have a problem
07-06-2019T00:19:47,BadFoMo,I can't due to lack of fath in myself/I'm in a different art department.
07-06-2019T00:19:48,steelabjur,"I twitch like a cold chihuahua at the best of time, so visual art is a bit beyond me."
07-06-2019T00:19:50,AFallingTree,i cant link them to you  but they are there
07-06-2019T00:19:59,SpinoSpiritNinja,"Well technically i have paper and pencil, but its not as good to work with"
07-06-2019T00:20:16,SpazztasticKiwi,I wanted to grab my white paint. So I shuffle everything to get to my paint box. Noticed a mess
07-06-2019T00:20:40,Ordithus,uh oh
07-06-2019T00:20:40,Mippy,:ptv-unimpressed: As an art student your comment annoys me

07-06-2019T00:21:16,RimaDraws,Oh no
07-06-2019T00:21:25,BadFoMo,What?

07-06-2019T00:21:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"Finally the vacuum clean, I clear the mess. Replace the vacuum to its spot and sit down"
07-06-2019T00:21:43,Mippy,A pencil and paper is a perfectly good thing to work with
07-06-2019T00:21:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Whole journey and I forgot the paint
07-06-2019T00:21:46,RimaDraws,I just brought my paints in to do a painting for the cultural arts festival

07-06-2019T00:22:14,RimaDraws,Yea
07-06-2019T00:22:30,AFallingTree,tbf mippy i find a graphic tab to be much easier to learn on cause of that quick undo feture
07-06-2019T00:22:36,AFallingTree,*feature
07-06-2019T00:22:36,Bgrmystr2,do / do not paint the cat? :thinking:

07-06-2019T00:23:05,Bgrmystr2,Perhaps the cat is in need of a good repainting and buffing.
07-06-2019T00:23:07,steelabjur,I just stepped out onto the porch to see what was making noise and saw two kittens out there playing!
07-06-2019T00:23:08,SpazztasticKiwi,"I swear my brain cells are the equivalent of the windows screen bouncy thing and the times it actually hits a corner, I experience an actual thought"

07-06-2019T00:23:38,SpazztasticKiwi,I was aiming to paint a figurine I have that’s faded

07-06-2019T00:39:52,sunblaze,interesting
07-06-2019T00:40:12,SageSaga,it's why his human form is so messed up :P
07-06-2019T00:40:30,Ordithus,:penguin:*[give me your sugary beverages or else]
07-06-2019T00:41:00,MarvTheHugPharaoh,never in my life have I ever felt threatened by a penguin before

07-06-2019T00:46:59,swack24,shame nobody picked the Girl kitty trace for color
07-06-2019T00:47:27,CrimsonHelsing,"One of my favorite versions of Trace, for sure!"
07-06-2019T00:47:28,RimaDraws,which one was that?
07-06-2019T00:48:42,swack24,the very first one where he have to pose for Eric thanks to the deal
07-06-2019T00:48:59,EricE549,"just listened to some of the chapter 2 audiobook, it's not my cup of tea"
07-06-2019T00:49:06,EricE549,@swack24 wth
07-06-2019T00:49:27,EricE549,what did you guys plan for me while i was gone???
07-06-2019T00:49:55,thestooge2222,Oh cool! demon tiger trace!
07-06-2019T00:50:02,thestooge2222,what else did I miss?
07-06-2019T00:50:08,TheSexyBeast,Trace almost looks wolf-like without his stripes (to me).
07-06-2019T00:50:26,EricE549,@thestooge2222 a lot more than i did apparently
07-06-2019T00:50:40,EricE549,these guys seem to have planned something that seems s u s p i c i o u s
07-06-2019T00:51:32,EricE549,guys please tell me what this deal is
07-06-2019T00:51:44,EricE549,i don't want to almost get cancelled again
07-06-2019T00:55:32,EricE549,"i'm legit scared cuz this ""deal"" @swack24 mentioned doesn't seem good"
07-06-2019T00:55:40,EricE549,pls halp
07-06-2019T00:55:50,RimaDraws,@SageSaga is there only a paypal option to pay with?
07-06-2019T00:56:12,Ordithus,Eric is a character in Twokinds.  Not you.
07-06-2019T00:56:18,EricE549,ohhh
07-06-2019T00:56:21,EricE549,ok
07-06-2019T00:56:34,EricE549,thx for the reassurance ord
07-06-2019T00:56:42,SageSaga,Paypal allows for credit cards and such
07-06-2019T00:56:58,RimaDraws,oh well i will need to transfer money
07-06-2019T00:57:21,EricE549,i've always wondered if you could pay for commisions with just a bank account
07-06-2019T00:58:20,SageSaga,like i said - Paypal allows you to use credit cards and such
07-06-2019T00:59:09,EricE549,"no but i mean without paypal, unless credit card usage is separate from paypal"
07-06-2019T00:59:14,RazorToshiba,"You can link a bank account to paypal or you can link a credit or debit card to paypal, or if you've been sent money to your paypal you can use that too"
07-06-2019T00:59:32,swack24,yay more Kitty trace
07-06-2019T00:59:55,EricE549,wow that's some cute art
07-06-2019T01:00:18,EricE549,so i guess trace gets converted to keidran or something
07-06-2019T01:00:38,AspiringNoodle,"If it's not in the comic, it's more or less some interestings non-canon scenario."
07-06-2019T01:00:44,EricE549,oh ok
07-06-2019T01:00:46,EricE549,cool
07-06-2019T01:01:15,EricE549,so yeah i probably won't continue the comic but i'll be here for the goooood vibes
07-06-2019T01:01:23,AFallingTree,right what have i missed?
07-06-2019T01:01:29,EricE549,i'll just learn from you guys

07-06-2019T01:06:11,EricE549,all these people stealing others melodies got me wondering just how big sampling is
07-06-2019T01:06:47,AspiringNoodle,"Had a good conversation yesterday.  ""Good artists copy, great artists steal."""
07-06-2019T01:06:57,AspiringNoodle,Memorize that quote :)
07-06-2019T01:07:20,SageSaga,dont
07-06-2019T01:07:36,AFallingTree,yeah thats low
07-06-2019T01:07:44,SageSaga,people are dumb and dont get the reason behind that
07-06-2019T01:08:21,SageSaga,it's not inherently wrong- but people don't get what it really means
07-06-2019T01:08:28,RazorToshiba,^
07-06-2019T01:08:30,RazorToshiba,tru
07-06-2019T01:09:07,AspiringNoodle,"People taking the quote LITERALLY aside.  The idea is that you can take something from a work you like, but you NEED to put your own spin on it.  Maybe mash it up with other things that inspire you."
07-06-2019T01:09:52,AspiringNoodle,"It's not bad if people recognize where it came from, but if it's different enough where people can't say that it's a copy, or even derivative, then you did it right."
07-06-2019T01:10:20,Mihari,"This reminds me of a reddit post, a guy shared a commission of his hero he got drawn up from city of heroes, turns out the artist just traced a superman image and did his outfit over it XD"
07-06-2019T01:10:31,AspiringNoodle,^
07-06-2019T01:10:35,AspiringNoodle,Example of BAD
07-06-2019T01:10:44,Mihari,Reddit ate it alive
07-06-2019T01:11:11,Mihari,I better go find it since sage will likely ask for the link
07-06-2019T01:11:36,Dadrobit,Back for a bit.
07-06-2019T01:12:18,MarvTheHugPharaoh,wb father
07-06-2019T01:12:18,Twokinds,I think this is good for now
07-06-2019T01:12:23,Twokinds,I'll add a background later
07-06-2019T01:12:27,AFallingTree,fair

07-06-2019T01:15:02,AspiringNoodle,Or is she putting it back together?
07-06-2019T01:15:05,AspiringNoodle,These are the questions.
07-06-2019T01:15:20,PurpleLemons,Nice work today Tom :clap:
07-06-2019T01:15:20,AFallingTree,lol

07-06-2019T01:15:38,steelabjur,Sleepy dragon
07-06-2019T01:15:56,AspiringNoodle,"The inconvenience of being so powerful that an immortal, nigh unkillable dragon, has become attracted to you."
07-06-2019T01:16:05,AspiringNoodle,What do you get?  Dragon cuddles that you have no say in xD
07-06-2019T01:17:16,steelabjur,"And late to work, because noone is moving her."
07-06-2019T01:17:46,Twokinds,Does come with the perk of being the only person in the world who can boss Nora around and get away with it.
07-06-2019T01:17:50,Twokinds,When she's awake.
07-06-2019T01:18:23,Bgrmystr2,xD
07-06-2019T01:18:26,AFallingTree,lmao
07-06-2019T01:19:11,AspiringNoodle,Shiny boy print~
07-06-2019T01:19:20,steelabjur,"Well, Trace can boss her around, if she'll actually do what he's bossing her to do is debatable."
07-06-2019T01:19:32,RimaDraws,are these and MM gonna be available online?
07-06-2019T01:19:41,Twokinds,"Yeah, after the cons"

07-06-2019T01:20:57,AspiringNoodle,They gave a squirrel... a steak... I don't see how that can't possibly go wrong later on :P
07-06-2019T01:21:53,AspiringNoodle,Something soothing about the dual-sided image and the shine
07-06-2019T01:21:53,steelabjur,"Well, they are omnivores."

07-06-2019T01:31:07,AspiringNoodle,My sleep is typically so poor in quality that I can sleep obscene amounts of time and still feel like crap.
07-06-2019T01:31:23,AspiringNoodle,And then there were the days where I slept for like 4 hours and was fine all day.
07-06-2019T01:33:24,AspiringNoodle,Maybe I should try Tom's diet.  If I lose a lot of weight it might help

07-06-2019T14:07:26,SpazztasticKiwi,"autocorrect, why’d you back out of fixing that before it posted"
07-06-2019T14:08:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I was in my doodle thing. I’d like the multi app thing but then I’d really never get anything done

07-06-2019T14:16:46,AspiringNoodle,I like that top panel xD
07-06-2019T14:16:56,AspiringNoodle,PHENOMENAL COSMIC SPACE
07-06-2019T14:17:06,AspiringNoodle,ity bity characters
07-06-2019T14:33:27,AspiringNoodle,"Woooooo, background!"
07-06-2019T14:41:56,AspiringNoodle,"Okay, that top panel is REALLY pretty :ptv-hearts:"
07-06-2019T14:52:00,AspiringNoodle,"Um... do we have alive audience, or nothing but ghosts? ^^;"
07-06-2019T14:54:25,SageSaga,mostly ghosts
07-06-2019T14:54:45,AspiringNoodle,"Oh my.  Such a shame, there's a lovely blue sky and green fields on this page."
07-06-2019T14:54:49,SageSaga,i trapped them here with a binding circle so they cant leave
07-06-2019T14:55:10,AspiringNoodle,Oh noes
07-06-2019T14:55:56,SageSaga,plot twist- im evil O_O
07-06-2019T14:56:05,SageSaga,:csagesaga-nynasmirk:
07-06-2019T14:56:26,Mihari,I've known that for years.
07-06-2019T14:56:27,AspiringNoodle,"I REALLY like the look of your cat girl, but those claws and that grin worry me xD"

07-06-2019T15:00:01,AspiringNoodle,:P
07-06-2019T15:00:05,RimaDraws,hiiiii

07-06-2019T15:01:36,FoxxTrotter,"Hi, Rima."
07-06-2019T15:01:55,SageSaga,yo Rima
07-06-2019T15:01:57,RimaDraws,i told myself i wouldnt miss this and i missed half
07-06-2019T15:02:43,SageSaga,im moving pretty fast
07-06-2019T15:02:51,AspiringNoodle,You missed the top panel when it was just a white space with tiny characters :P
07-06-2019T15:03:06,AspiringNoodle,"Granted, it's STILL a large space with tiny characters, but it has such a pretty background"
07-06-2019T15:03:35,BadFoMo,Inb4 it's covered in a wall of text?
07-06-2019T15:04:05,AspiringNoodle,You just gave me a flashback to an episode of Archer.
07-06-2019T15:04:16,BadFoMo,I did?
07-06-2019T15:04:30,AspiringNoodle,The show featured a very beautiful painting
07-06-2019T15:04:52,AspiringNoodle,But the artist covered that painting with layer upon layer of white paint.  So thick to the point that there's no way you'll ever see the original work :)
07-06-2019T15:05:16,AspiringNoodle,"Beautiful background, hidden under a wall of text xD"
07-06-2019T15:14:17,AspiringNoodle,Anyone else curious about the future of super hero films?
07-06-2019T15:14:35,RimaDraws,i know i am seeing spiderman far from home
07-06-2019T15:15:06,AspiringNoodle,"I'm not too worried about that or Guardians part 3.  I AM worried about any other films, though."
07-06-2019T15:15:14,RimaDraws,hm?
07-06-2019T15:15:25,RimaDraws,i missed alot oh no he is on shading ;;
07-06-2019T15:15:48,AspiringNoodle,But doesn't it look pretty? :D
07-06-2019T15:17:02,SageSaga,i hope they make a Spectre movie
07-06-2019T15:17:28,AspiringNoodle,Anyways
07-06-2019T15:17:50,AspiringNoodle,"DC has always been kind've a mess, though I do enjoy it.  Can't pick between bro-dude Aquaman and Wonder Woman xD"
07-06-2019T15:18:18,AspiringNoodle,Dark Phoenix is looking to be a bit of a let-down for a 20-year cap.
07-06-2019T15:18:27,AspiringNoodle,And the MCU lost so many of its big players :(
07-06-2019T15:18:54,AspiringNoodle,Still too soon for spoilers?
07-06-2019T15:19:27,AspiringNoodle,Sorry ^^;
07-06-2019T15:19:28,SageSaga,dont talk about it
07-06-2019T15:19:29,SageSaga,:P
07-06-2019T15:21:34,SageSaga,Spectre would make a great Dark Super hero movie
07-06-2019T15:21:38,w0lfmare,Aquaman movie really bothered me
07-06-2019T15:21:44,AspiringNoodle,Oh?
07-06-2019T15:22:21,SageSaga,i really liked Aquaman - it's a bit of a run around but the action and visuals were awesome and well done
07-06-2019T15:22:33,sunblaze,^that
07-06-2019T15:22:36,AspiringNoodle,*grabs :popcorn:*
07-06-2019T15:22:45,w0lfmare,"Yeah the visuals were nice, but I didn't like the writing for it"
07-06-2019T15:23:05,sunblaze,the fact that they merged 3 movies into one?
07-06-2019T15:23:33,SageSaga,the dialogue was kinda goofy but it also felt very comicbookish!
07-06-2019T15:24:04,SageSaga,but i forget all about it when the storm over the trench scene- that was amazing
07-06-2019T15:24:34,AspiringNoodle,I loved the atlantian who had to choose between suffocating and sticking their head in a toilet  :ptv-laugh:
07-06-2019T15:24:35,SageSaga,"that was one of those times where i can point at the screen and say ""ART!"""
07-06-2019T15:24:52,SageSaga,not that part
07-06-2019T15:25:02,SageSaga,i was referring to the trench
07-06-2019T15:25:17,SageSaga,that part - was silly but kinda bleh- i hate toilet humor
07-06-2019T15:25:35,AspiringNoodle,LITERAL toilet humor?  Or just in general? :ptv-snicker:
07-06-2019T15:25:48,SageSaga,both
07-06-2019T15:26:08,w0lfmare,I loved the kraken part
07-06-2019T15:26:34,SageSaga,yeah i liked that too
07-06-2019T15:27:03,SageSaga,there were a lot of scenes i liked- as a whole i felt it was enjoyable
07-06-2019T15:27:11,SageSaga,but i do see a lot of faults in it
07-06-2019T15:27:41,AspiringNoodle,Ever watch CinemaSins?
07-06-2019T15:28:18,RimaDraws,also sage just waitin for my money transfer from my bank to paypal and i will be buying the book. i cant wait ><
07-06-2019T15:28:19,SageSaga,occasionally- its good to remember that its comedy and not a tear down
07-06-2019T15:28:51,w0lfmare,"Overall I didn't like the character interactions. The characters didn't come alive for me, and they bent too much for the sake of the story"
07-06-2019T15:29:16,SageSaga,I agree
07-06-2019T15:30:05,AspiringNoodle,"I'm just amazed at how quickly tech as evolved, tbh."
07-06-2019T15:30:26,w0lfmare,"I think one of the things marvel does better is keeping the characters in character, while also finding ways to make them tell the story they want to tell"
07-06-2019T15:30:54,AspiringNoodle,That I can agree with
07-06-2019T15:31:11,AspiringNoodle,Batman v Superman is the epitome of DC's character writing issues.
07-06-2019T15:31:45,SageSaga,DC has some of the worse super hero movies- but they have some of the best super heroes
07-06-2019T15:31:51,AspiringNoodle,^
07-06-2019T15:32:00,AspiringNoodle,Wonder Woman though <3
07-06-2019T15:32:13,SageSaga,its why i want a Spectre movie and a Booster Gold Movie- a movie of 52 would be awesome
07-06-2019T15:33:21,AspiringNoodle,"Thanks Google, I knew that name sounded familiar"
07-06-2019T15:33:25,AspiringNoodle,Ghostly justice >:D
07-06-2019T15:34:55,RimaDraws,booster gold lol omg that guy
07-06-2019T15:34:57,RimaDraws,he is funny
07-06-2019T15:35:16,RimaDraws,i remember him from DCUO
07-06-2019T15:35:59,AspiringNoodle,"Oh my, I just looked up Booster"
07-06-2019T15:36:21,AspiringNoodle,"And my question is, WHY WOULD A MUSEUM HAVE POWERFUL PIECES OF STILL *FUNCTIONAL* TECH OUT ON DISPLAY WITH MINIMAL SECURITY???"
07-06-2019T15:36:25,AspiringNoodle,Dear God!!!
07-06-2019T15:36:26,SageSaga,he's amazing - he goes from being a Security guard at a museum to the savior of the universe- but no one gets to know
07-06-2019T15:36:46,SageSaga,actually they answer that
07-06-2019T15:36:52,AspiringNoodle,Oh dear xD
07-06-2019T15:36:57,SageSaga,and he was the security XD
07-06-2019T15:38:00,SageSaga,but also his son is a time traveler and put the pieces in place to make sure his father became the hero he needed to be
07-06-2019T15:38:11,AspiringNoodle,*facepalm*
07-06-2019T15:38:19,AspiringNoodle,"Closed time loop, should've guessed :/"
07-06-2019T15:38:46,SageSaga,did you see Shazam?
07-06-2019T15:38:56,AspiringNoodle,Yes :ptv-hearts:
07-06-2019T15:39:13,SageSaga,did you see the after credits scene?
07-06-2019T15:39:48,AspiringNoodle,Oh yeah
07-06-2019T15:39:54,AspiringNoodle,BRANIAC LIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIVES
07-06-2019T15:39:59,SageSaga,. . . no
07-06-2019T15:40:05,AspiringNoodle,Awww :(
07-06-2019T15:40:20,SageSaga,that was Mr Mind- the Caterpillar
07-06-2019T15:41:16,AspiringNoodle,I have above entry-level knowledge ^^;
07-06-2019T15:41:22,SageSaga,when he cocoons himself- he emerges and legit starts to eat the entire multiverse
07-06-2019T15:41:29,AspiringNoodle,D:
07-06-2019T15:41:53,AspiringNoodle,"Now I am curious, when are they going to introduce Braniac into the DCU?"
07-06-2019T15:41:56,SageSaga,and who saves us from the end of all? FREAKN BOOSTER GOLD
07-06-2019T15:42:29,AspiringNoodle,"He's gonna be super smug and shameless while doing it too, right?"
07-06-2019T15:42:51,SageSaga,no - he's serious and works his butt off
07-06-2019T15:43:07,SageSaga,but no one knows what he did and no one believes him
07-06-2019T15:43:25,SageSaga,well - except Batman
07-06-2019T15:43:30,AspiringNoodle,Wouldn't be the first time I've seen stuff like that happen.
07-06-2019T15:43:46,SageSaga,Batman is human lie detector
07-06-2019T15:43:55,AspiringNoodle,He's the God damn Batman
07-06-2019T15:44:01,SageSaga,no!
07-06-2019T15:44:07,SageSaga,that is a different batman
07-06-2019T15:44:12,SageSaga,a fake batman
07-06-2019T15:44:20,AspiringNoodle,All Batman are the GD Batman :P
07-06-2019T15:44:36,AspiringNoodle,"Okay, okay, I'll stop now xD"
07-06-2019T15:44:42,AspiringNoodle,You're the actual comic fan here :P
07-06-2019T15:47:20,SageSaga,Booster Gold uses his Pompous personality as his secret identity - while he is actually protecting the time line
07-06-2019T15:47:39,w0lfmare,I still need to see shazam
07-06-2019T15:47:51,w0lfmare,Waiting to see it on DVD
07-06-2019T15:47:53,SageSaga,he saved batman by going back in time and drinking with Jonah Hex
07-06-2019T15:48:13,AspiringNoodle,There is so much character development in that film.  Also several scenes at the end you NEED to see.
07-06-2019T15:48:37,AspiringNoodle,"Multiple post-credits, at that"
07-06-2019T15:48:46,SageSaga,for a while the thing was - Booster Gold would go back in time and fight- and fail- but with time travel he could try over and over- and usually the answer was to just talk
07-06-2019T15:49:06,AspiringNoodle,Fighting isn't always the solution??? Who knew!
07-06-2019T15:49:28,AspiringNoodle,"*whispers under breath ""Batman knew... he always knows...""*"
07-06-2019T15:50:07,SageSaga,oh there was a great comic where Hal Jordan was going to vanish from the time line
07-06-2019T15:51:40,SageSaga,something manipulated the time line to have Sinestro go to earth- and to talk him into leaving- Booster Gold lied and said his power ring (The Legion Flight ring) was from the Sinestro Corps
07-06-2019T15:52:56,AspiringNoodle,Comic books man
07-06-2019T15:53:00,AspiringNoodle,Always with the time travel
07-06-2019T15:54:59,SageSaga,"well- y'all take care, im done!"

07-06-2019T19:26:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d do it myself but you can’t massage yourself
07-06-2019T19:28:36,AspiringNoodle,...I think Kat already proved otherwise :ptv-laugh:
07-06-2019T21:11:35,AspiringNoodle,"Okay, I know they say that adjusting to a new sleep schedule is supposed to leave you tired, but this is ridiculous!"

07-06-2019T21:36:21,RimaDraws,hi

07-06-2019T22:00:40,AspiringNoodle,Anyone else feel grateful to grow up in a time with internet?
07-06-2019T22:00:46,AspiringNoodle,I know I am :ptv-hearts:
07-06-2019T22:05:00,NibblyBot,New Patreon Post: Sketch Suggestions Poll! https://www.patreon.com/posts/sketch-poll-27495516
07-06-2019T22:10:16,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve been sitting here playing which font for over 30 minutes and it’s starting to make me wonder if it’s worth it
07-06-2019T22:18:33,SpazztasticKiwi,with that poll dump mine has a near negative possibly
07-06-2019T22:19:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Nibbly with wee babbies. Mini Nibblies - the ankle nippers
07-06-2019T22:19:53,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-nibsdance::ctwokinds-nibsdance::ctwokinds-nibsdance::ctwokinds-nibsdance::ctwokinds-nibsbounce:
07-06-2019T22:20:37,AspiringNoodle,The reason why that wouldn't win is simple.
07-06-2019T22:21:01,AspiringNoodle,It would start a chain reaction.  Soon the world would be swarming with mini Nibblies.
07-06-2019T22:21:19,AspiringNoodle,"It would be apocalypse.  Cute, fuzzy apocalypse, but apocalypse nonetheless."
07-06-2019T22:21:23,AspiringNoodle,DO YOU WANT THAT TO HAPPEN???
07-06-2019T22:25:10,RimaDraws,little ankle nibblets
07-06-2019T22:29:46,AspiringNoodle,I imagine it'd be like the grey goo theory.
07-06-2019T22:29:48,AspiringNoodle,Except brown
07-06-2019T22:29:55,AspiringNoodle,And suuuuuper fuzzy.
07-06-2019T22:47:29,AspiringNoodle,"Hmmm, I hope it's not adrenaline that kicked in.  Was super tired like 2 - 3 hours ago, now I feel fine."
07-06-2019T23:03:30,SpazztasticKiwi,that wasn’t my suggestion
07-06-2019T23:11:27,AspiringNoodle,But that's the only logical conclusion to what would happen if your suggestion won.
07-06-2019T23:11:38,AspiringNoodle,And therefore it cannot be allowed :P
07-06-2019T23:20:15,SpazztasticKiwi,just now bothered to google Hiddlestons age. He is not 30ish like I’d guessed
07-06-2019T23:28:09,AspiringNoodle,You'd be surprised
07-06-2019T23:28:27,AspiringNoodle,Some major actors don't become A-list household names until they're in their 50's / 60's
07-06-2019T23:28:51,AspiringNoodle,All it takes is one movie <3
07-06-2019T23:35:29,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve pretty much decided an older mans my aim. It’s like they ripen with age
07-06-2019T23:44:26,SpazztasticKiwi,he’s just so aggressively British
