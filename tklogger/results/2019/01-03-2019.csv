01-03-2019T00:03:08,Ordithus,Basitins are quite prudish

01-03-2019T00:06:16,NezumiYuki,I've found that aspect of Basitin Doctors to be fascinating. Tactile surgery skills must be godly good!
01-03-2019T00:06:37,Mippy,"I mean if we take Keith's ""kink"" as a normal thing for Basitins (males at least)....tourtcher might not be the best way to punish someone"
01-03-2019T00:06:41,Combak,Or they just have a high mortality rate.

01-03-2019T01:39:13,Twokinds,Yes good idea
01-03-2019T01:39:23,Twokinds,Have Kaylin be topless on the cover. That'll have the books flying off the shelves.
01-03-2019T01:39:43,Twokinds,Mostly by the sellers and con officials.
01-03-2019T01:39:45,unsteddyphoenix,Works for Tom! :D
01-03-2019T01:39:53,SageSaga,it would also make them unavailable on shelves
01-03-2019T01:40:12,unsteddyphoenix,Are you saying tom couldnt put what hes drawing right now on shelves?

01-03-2019T01:40:49,Bgrmystr2,but you don't draw those right sage

01-03-2019T06:46:57,Bgrmystr2,it was right after sage finished streaming that he updated to this one
01-03-2019T06:47:00,Dadrobit,I just woke up and read the chat from last night. Refreshed when I was done and Natani is poofed.
01-03-2019T06:47:32,Xexanoth,so the next stream offline pic is gonna be Keith waring those pink panties right?
01-03-2019T06:47:40,unsteddyphoenix,lmao

01-03-2019T06:49:30,RimaDraws,i freaked out earlier over it
01-03-2019T06:50:43,Xexanoth,"hehe, he could do it like one of those children books: ""Where has Natani gone"" and it's just keith looking at different places to look for Natani :)"
01-03-2019T06:51:15,BadFoMo,"This reminds me; when Tom wakes up, I should thank him for letting me see/grab this pic."
01-03-2019T07:00:56,RimaDraws,idk how i am still up and doing a stream

01-03-2019T09:36:02,denmander,where?
01-03-2019T09:36:47,Nekonny,cabeca
01-03-2019T09:37:01,denmander,"não isso, onde na cabeça?"
01-03-2019T09:37:12,denmander,"frente, cima ou atrás?"

01-03-2019T09:37:33,RimaDraws,how is you?
01-03-2019T09:38:08,Nekonny,bit of a headache
01-03-2019T09:38:17,RimaDraws,naw ;; that sucks
01-03-2019T09:38:26,Nekonny,usually happens if I sleep too much or too little
01-03-2019T09:38:34,RimaDraws,same here dude
01-03-2019T09:38:55,Nekonny,"only slight, prob go away soon"
01-03-2019T09:42:42,Nekonny,you giuys doing ok?
01-03-2019T09:43:12,denmander,trying to be
01-03-2019T09:45:46,Pimsan,"Good, watching Shatori's stream right now."
01-03-2019T09:46:07,Pimsan,Right now she's waiting for someone to get an burst commission.
01-03-2019T09:48:52,Nekonny,I'm probably going to start looking into live 2d again
01-03-2019T09:49:16,Nekonny,"Ive only ever done one animation on it, and it's been a long long time"
01-03-2019T09:49:31,Nekonny,but I think it may be time to give it another chance
01-03-2019T09:49:47,Nekonny,although I'm weary of how much more involved it is
01-03-2019T09:50:05,Nekonny,"in other words, it's going to tke me a heck of a lot longer to set up a single animation"
01-03-2019T09:53:44,hrdc,hi
01-03-2019T09:53:54,Nekonny,yo
01-03-2019T09:54:41,hrdc,a fire axe :eyes:
01-03-2019T09:55:06,Nekonny,XD
01-03-2019T09:55:28,Nekonny,something strikes me as odd though
01-03-2019T09:55:49,Nekonny,I need to figure out how the program treats objects like these
01-03-2019T09:56:43,hrdc,oh! This is one of them puppet tweeninf softwares... however they're called
01-03-2019T09:59:15,hrdc,looks complex :eyes::sweat_drops:
01-03-2019T10:06:23,Nekonny,It can be very simple
01-03-2019T10:06:44,Nekonny,or you can be like me and spend time trying to figure out how to do an effect
01-03-2019T10:06:58,Nekonny,"in this case, I would like to know how to totate an object"
01-03-2019T10:07:15,Nekonny,"seems simple, but I can't seem to find it"
01-03-2019T10:08:19,Nekonny,"there seems to be a solution, but it looks like its only for the more complex template?"
01-03-2019T10:08:27,Nekonny,doesnt qquite make sense to me...
01-03-2019T10:11:27,hrdc,"well, you're trying to make a 3dimensional animation out of a 2d picture. That won't be easy"
01-03-2019T10:11:41,Nekonny,I should be able to rote an object without it causing any deformation
01-03-2019T10:13:11,hrdc,you mean like flipping it?
01-03-2019T10:13:19,hrdc,or half flipping it :thinking:
01-03-2019T10:15:55,Nekonny,rotating it
01-03-2019T10:16:01,Nekonny,while it doesnt deform
01-03-2019T10:17:02,denmander,in code that should be much easier to perform than deforming it
01-03-2019T10:18:37,Nekonny,if I had access to the code
01-03-2019T10:18:51,Nekonny,I would have manually translated this program myears ago XD
01-03-2019T10:19:10,hrdc,is this live2d?
01-03-2019T10:19:45,denmander,it's emofuri
01-03-2019T10:20:54,Nekonny,"kinda like live 2d, but its supposed to be a lot less complicated"
01-03-2019T10:21:01,Nekonny,"also, a lot less versitile"
01-03-2019T10:21:05,Nekonny,its a tradeoff
01-03-2019T10:21:19,denmander,and only in japanese :p
01-03-2019T10:21:39,hrdc,sounds like it's not worth the effort :ptv-uneasy:
01-03-2019T10:21:39,Nekonny,"Solution; cut out a peice of paper in the size of the object in it's original location, and use it as a guide when rotating"
01-03-2019T10:22:33,Nekonny,"Result: not perfect, but its not bad either"
01-03-2019T10:24:18,UltraBondageFairy,yo!
01-03-2019T10:25:16,Nekonny,yo!
01-03-2019T10:25:28,Nekonny,I think this works well enough as a proof aof concept XD
01-03-2019T10:27:52,hrdc,"one one side, having an actual animation made this way sounds exciting but"
01-03-2019T10:28:07,hrdc,looks like a lot of work :eyes::sweat_drops:
01-03-2019T10:29:15,Nekonny,Ive made one of these befor in... 3 hours
01-03-2019T10:29:31,Nekonny,Ive also spent weeks working on one
01-03-2019T10:29:40,Nekonny,all depends on how far you want to go with it
01-03-2019T10:34:03,Krakdskul,I was in the user list and noticed someone had the Android phone symbol next to their name
01-03-2019T10:34:35,SteelDragonFist,Yo

01-03-2019T10:51:54,Nekonny,you see the other two animations playing on my stream?
01-03-2019T10:52:01,Nekonny,they were made with the same program
01-03-2019T10:53:02,hrdc,I thought they were manually animated :thinking:
01-03-2019T10:53:02,Nekonny,"ok , so ive imported them, now I need to figure out how to deform them the same way"
01-03-2019T10:53:08,Nekonny,nope
01-03-2019T10:55:46,SteelDragonFist,I'll be back next time.

01-03-2019T15:15:40,SageSaga,well in that case Sunblaze- any ideas for your request this month?
01-03-2019T15:15:55,sunblaze,granted I am still unsure if nyna just does not do all this to one day kill her. maybe a long time plan :P
01-03-2019T15:16:22,sunblaze,I do and it involves a party and amrdi gras. still needs a few days to flesh it out what char would be the best for
01-03-2019T15:16:40,sunblaze,mardi gràs
01-03-2019T15:20:05,CatzArt,My choice in music is not matching the tone of this stream. Where is my Kenny G CD? The red army choir doesnt work for this.

01-03-2019T15:22:28,BadFoMo,"@CatzArt A little unrelated, but does Cyberworld by Hatford(?) work? That's what was just playing."
01-03-2019T15:22:48,BadFoMo,"Uh, what /I/ was just playing."
01-03-2019T15:22:55,CatzArt,Let me check FoMo and Mippy none of us are mature here.
01-03-2019T15:23:10,Bgrmystr2,speak for yourself Catz
01-03-2019T15:23:21,Mippy,It was joke :ptv-SteelwormHades:
01-03-2019T15:23:37,CatzArt,Oh i know.
01-03-2019T15:24:51,Mippy,Boob squeezes
01-03-2019T15:25:04,Mippy,Very fun
01-03-2019T15:25:06,CatzArt,"This song is pretty good FoMo. However, I still believe that the sweet sounds of Kenny G on the saxaphone is more appropriate"
01-03-2019T15:26:23,CatzArt,"I do believe the Kieth ""neat"" image would be appropriate here. But I would rather not appear crass."
01-03-2019T15:26:30,kittyelfie,hui
01-03-2019T15:26:32,kittyelfie,hi
01-03-2019T15:26:35,BadFoMo,Yo.
01-03-2019T15:26:37,CatzArt,Hiya
01-03-2019T15:26:46,Mippy,Bounce those titties
01-03-2019T15:27:16,Mippy,Ill be crass
01-03-2019T15:28:26,BadFoMo,So they're hidden in the shadows to hide the lewdness?
01-03-2019T15:28:28,CatzArt,I would expect nothing less from you Mippy. Take it away.
01-03-2019T15:28:48,CatzArt,Yess lets go with that FoMo
01-03-2019T15:29:28,CatzArt,Yes the kenny g is much more appropriate for this
01-03-2019T15:30:08,BadFoMo,...Shot to be colored in the book?
01-03-2019T15:30:59,SageSaga,i cant blatantly be showing two girls scissoring in my comic...
01-03-2019T15:33:16,denmander,:o
01-03-2019T15:33:43,CatzArt,Well thats all dependent on the pg rating you want Sage. :ptv-condescending:
01-03-2019T15:34:28,CatzArt,and now that the Kenny G song is over its back to the red army choir. Fine ill make this work.
01-03-2019T15:36:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Well that’s an interesting first message to read on break
01-03-2019T15:36:20,SageSaga,?
01-03-2019T15:40:55,denmander,at least this explains the mature content tag
01-03-2019T15:41:38,CatzArt,Hiya Kiwi
01-03-2019T15:42:14,Bgrmystr2,heya kiwi
01-03-2019T15:42:15,sunblaze,this comic will have an adult warning: only click this if you want the REAL lewd! then the comic appears
01-03-2019T15:42:24,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-ohmy:
01-03-2019T15:42:30,sunblaze,of course Everyone will click that. but just for security :D
01-03-2019T15:43:25,CatzArt,:ptv-victory:
01-03-2019T15:45:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Sage. You’re last comment was the first I saw coming in from break
01-03-2019T15:45:43,SageSaga,ah- brb
01-03-2019T15:46:32,BadFoMo,"This reminds me; (although unlikly to happen here) in this game, is it possable for PCs/NPCs to get pregnant?"
01-03-2019T15:47:02,SpazztasticKiwi,preganet
01-03-2019T15:47:04,CatzArt,Not from this no.
01-03-2019T15:47:14,CatzArt,greganenant
01-03-2019T15:47:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Pregananant
01-03-2019T15:47:26,sunblaze,oh god nooooo that meme :D sooo god :D
01-03-2019T15:47:30,CatzArt,thank youKiwi
01-03-2019T15:47:56,Bgrmystr2,gregnant?! Where? :ptv-shock:
01-03-2019T15:49:04,CatzArt,Right there Bgr. No not there. Over there. Yes right there.
01-03-2019T15:49:20,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-confused: that's a scary.
01-03-2019T15:49:27,Bgrmystr2,one single scary.
01-03-2019T15:49:50,SageSaga,if NPCs didnt have sex and have children- how would there still be NPCs?
01-03-2019T15:49:58,CatzArt,Coding
01-03-2019T15:49:59,sunblaze,^magic!
01-03-2019T15:50:28,Bgrmystr2,npcs never age in most games so I wouldn't expect them to in that one either..?
01-03-2019T15:50:52,sunblaze,"hmmm you are not wrong catz. if a ""friend-list"" still exists coding could be a viable way."
01-03-2019T15:50:57,SageSaga,life spans are a thing and its been over 300 years
01-03-2019T15:50:59,CatzArt,I woder how taking it would be on a game engine to have NPCs
01-03-2019T15:51:00,sunblaze,maybe they just loose their memories?
01-03-2019T15:51:26,denmander,"the npcs just ""happen"""
01-03-2019T15:51:46,BadFoMo,They would just spawn into exestence in areas that the player cannot acsess?
01-03-2019T15:51:51,CatzArt,the game dev gods just blink them into existance
01-03-2019T15:52:17,BadFoMo,.../behind the player's back?
01-03-2019T15:52:37,CatzArt,Unless you want the horrible Fable games baby making system.
01-03-2019T15:52:54,SageSaga,There is sex and pregnancy in AI's game
01-03-2019T15:54:15,CatzArt,I didnt even know that this comic was set in a game till this stream. I havent made it through Yosh yet. Why must you make so many pages for me to read Sage?:ptv-dealwithit:
01-03-2019T15:54:34,Bgrmystr2,this is a completely different comic though
01-03-2019T15:54:41,CatzArt,I know
01-03-2019T15:54:44,Bgrmystr2,and doesn't require you to finish yosh before you read it..
01-03-2019T15:54:58,SageSaga,you should Read AI so you can finish it- because you can never finish Yosh...
01-03-2019T15:55:10,sunblaze,AI is also not that long. start reading it and you might finish in 2 hours
01-03-2019T15:55:21,Bgrmystr2,yeah exactly ^
01-03-2019T15:55:39,CatzArt,Very well. Hold my beer. Wait i dont drink. HOLD MAH TEA!
01-03-2019T15:56:19,ColeRusz,sage what are you working on
01-03-2019T15:56:41,CatzArt,Everything Cole.
01-03-2019T15:56:57,BadFoMo,"I could see it now. A Player is in an ally by themself, another player kills a shopkeeper to rob the place, the game makes a new NPC to have an NPC that runs said shop. ...right behind the first player's back. NPC: Hi :)! Player: AHH!"
01-03-2019T15:57:10,ColeRusz,what's everything
01-03-2019T15:57:18,SageSaga,im working on my comics

01-03-2019T15:58:46,BadFoMo,That. What Sage pasted.
01-03-2019T15:58:56,BadFoMo,*posted.
01-03-2019T15:59:00,SageSaga,pardon the subpar layout- Mihari is working on a brand new layout
01-03-2019T15:59:22,CatzArt,you mean the website or the page Sage?
01-03-2019T15:59:30,SageSaga,the website
01-03-2019T15:59:37,SageSaga,and the page?
01-03-2019T16:00:02,Dakina,Ello all.

01-03-2019T16:00:09,CatzArt,Sup Dakina
01-03-2019T16:00:50,Dakina,Not much CatzArt.
01-03-2019T16:01:19,CatzArt,So whats up Dakina? Other than the ceiling of course.
01-03-2019T16:02:00,BadFoMo,...The sky?
01-03-2019T16:02:36,CatzArt,Just enjoy the bad dad joke FoMo
01-03-2019T16:02:49,Bgrmystr2,he can't.
01-03-2019T16:03:46,Bgrmystr2,is.. sage is she pushing her butt against the 4th wall? xD
01-03-2019T16:03:59,CatzArt,"why is fun not included with FoMo? the batteries are, so i guess it evens out"
01-03-2019T16:04:25,CatzArt,Oh soft cell shading. nice sage
01-03-2019T16:04:32,Bgrmystr2,ah there we go
01-03-2019T16:04:34,sunblaze,omg bgr yes it looks that way

01-03-2019T16:04:40,Bgrmystr2,it did for a sec haha
01-03-2019T16:06:58,CatzArt,I wanna watch this stream still but I also gotta read this paper on Patterns in Beaver Herbivory in south-central Kansas riparian woodlands. Grumble:ptv-unimpressed:
01-03-2019T16:07:19,CatzArt,guess Ill be back when Im done
01-03-2019T16:09:56,CatzArt,having to read the beaver paper and not watch this stream is such a dam shame
01-03-2019T16:15:17,RimaDraws,Hii
01-03-2019T16:15:24,FoxxTrotter,"E'lo, Rima."
01-03-2019T16:15:26,BadFoMo,Yo.
01-03-2019T16:15:49,SageSaga,yo
01-03-2019T16:16:02,RimaDraws,Hi sage
01-03-2019T16:16:52,RimaDraws,I woke up a hour ago after working on stream 7 hours ago. Head hurts
01-03-2019T16:16:58,Twokinds,:ptv-greetings:
01-03-2019T16:17:05,RimaDraws,Hi tom!
01-03-2019T16:17:29,RimaDraws,I updated my OBS and I can finally stream without it pausing!
01-03-2019T16:17:45,Bgrmystr2,"hey Rima, Tom"
01-03-2019T16:17:52,RimaDraws,Hey bgr
01-03-2019T16:18:19,CatzArt,welcome rima
01-03-2019T16:18:21,RimaDraws,Might try to stream more if I can. I gotta work on another patron post or two
01-03-2019T16:18:27,RimaDraws,Hi catz
01-03-2019T16:19:19,RimaDraws,Finished a screenshot redraw for a past patron post and it turned out well so I’m happy with it
01-03-2019T16:19:26,BadFoMo,"@Twokinds While you're here and before I forget, thanks for letting me see/grab that new Offline picture!"
01-03-2019T16:20:20,FoxxTrotter,"Hi, Tom."
01-03-2019T16:22:13,RimaDraws,This is looking good sage
01-03-2019T16:22:56,SageSaga,ty
01-03-2019T16:31:16,Twokinds,No prob BadFoMo
01-03-2019T16:35:59,CatzArt,"So I read a few pages of the Artificial Incident comic, instead of doing school work like I should and I thought of this question ""what drives people to pick the opposite gender in RP games?"" ROle playing, prefrence, orientation, appeal? Could do a study."
01-03-2019T16:36:32,sunblaze,easy: watching a guys ass all game is boring
01-03-2019T16:36:52,sunblaze,granted does only work in third person games
01-03-2019T16:37:41,CatzArt,Like in Skyrim?
01-03-2019T16:37:54,sunblaze,ESPECIALLY in skyrim :D
01-03-2019T16:38:18,Bgrmystr2,RPGs are literally Role Playing Games so..
01-03-2019T16:38:32,Bgrmystr2,"RP kind of has a lot to do with, yknow, 100% of the game."
01-03-2019T16:39:00,sunblaze,thats the intend yes. But I disagree that everyone sees it that way
01-03-2019T16:39:29,Bgrmystr2,people don't need to see it that way though
01-03-2019T16:39:30,CatzArt,Yes I know that Bgr. Its the reasons behind that thats got me interested.
01-03-2019T16:39:43,Bgrmystr2,"as soon as you play it, you're participating"
01-03-2019T16:40:39,Bgrmystr2,"honestly, there's too many factors to really say for sure. Some people just want a representation of themselves. Some people want something different."
01-03-2019T16:41:08,Bgrmystr2,"Some people want their own fantasy, some just want to use it to exploit others"
01-03-2019T16:41:14,CatzArt,"For instance I always play as a male in skyrim cuz I am a male and want to RP in that world as if I was there. However for some like sun, would play as a female to have an ass to look at. This would be a great study to do"
01-03-2019T16:41:33,CatzArt,shame im not a psychology major
01-03-2019T16:41:41,Bgrmystr2,fairly sure there's already been studies
01-03-2019T16:42:07,CatzArt,Most likely. I should find some. It would be an interesting read
01-03-2019T16:42:16,kittyelfie,"In MMO games, Pretty much all that I see of my character is the back of the head."
01-03-2019T16:42:19,sunblaze,the ass is not the only reason. but surely a major one for me yes
01-03-2019T16:42:41,Bgrmystr2,"I've not played any RPG games where it's 3rd person, I'm not a fan of that kinda game"
01-03-2019T16:42:54,Bgrmystr2,so I don't have the thing sunblaze has
01-03-2019T16:43:04,CatzArt,But skyrim gives you the Option of third person
01-03-2019T16:43:54,sunblaze,well I dislike first person unless its a pure shooter. so yeah :ptv-nope:
01-03-2019T16:44:10,CatzArt,I tend to play in the third person
01-03-2019T16:44:35,CatzArt,and talk in third person if this one is a Khajiit.
01-03-2019T16:45:48,RedDragonSyndicate,Hey Sage
01-03-2019T16:45:55,CatzArt,Hiya Red
01-03-2019T16:45:56,FoxxTrotter,"Hiya, Red."
01-03-2019T16:46:11,SageSaga,yo Red
01-03-2019T16:46:13,SageSaga,whats up?
01-03-2019T16:46:19,CatzArt,the sky
01-03-2019T16:46:31,RedDragonSyndicate,Not much. Lazy Saturday
01-03-2019T16:46:50,RedDragonSyndicate,"and this looks lewd, ha ha"
01-03-2019T16:46:55,RedDragonSyndicate,Wholesome lewd
01-03-2019T16:47:10,Bgrmystr2,"back with food, and yeah I don't play skyrim Catz"
01-03-2019T16:47:14,SteelDragonFist,Yo.
01-03-2019T16:47:15,SageSaga,it should look a bit lewd considering is foreplay for the sex
01-03-2019T16:47:16,Bgrmystr2,"yeh it's good, Red"
01-03-2019T16:47:29,SteelDragonFist,How's it going?
01-03-2019T16:47:53,CatzArt,Hiya Steel
01-03-2019T16:48:14,Bgrmystr2,"Hey steel, weren't you here already before? :ptv-wondering:"
01-03-2019T16:48:46,SteelDragonFist,Yeah I was when I was seeing Nekonny stream.
01-03-2019T16:48:55,FoxxTrotter,"Hi, SDF."
01-03-2019T16:49:12,Bgrmystr2,ah yeah okay
01-03-2019T16:49:59,SteelDragonFist,I wanted to multi-stream with Nekonny but I had to check with Sage first.
01-03-2019T16:50:16,SteelDragonFist,Sadly I'm at work.
01-03-2019T16:50:53,SteelDragonFist,I won't be off until 10:00pm.
01-03-2019T16:50:54,SageSaga,why would you need my permission to stream with Nekonny?
01-03-2019T16:51:12,Bgrmystr2,"well you are the host, he can't invite ppl xD"
01-03-2019T16:51:20,SageSaga,he can leave any time he wants
01-03-2019T16:51:34,Bgrmystr2,true.
01-03-2019T16:51:34,SageSaga,i just forgot to kick him
01-03-2019T16:56:36,SteelDragonFist,Okay
01-03-2019T16:57:29,Taremong,"Hm. There is a new Stream Offline picture. Also, hi Sage!"
01-03-2019T16:57:46,SageSaga,howdy
01-03-2019T16:57:50,Dakina,That page looks great SageSaga.
01-03-2019T16:57:57,SageSaga,thanks
01-03-2019T16:57:58,SteelDragonFist,"Anyway, I'm just going to enjoy this sexy comic page."
01-03-2019T16:58:39,CatzArt,Hiya Taremong welcome
01-03-2019T16:58:47,SteelDragonFist,While I hide from my working duties of course.
01-03-2019T16:59:00,CatzArt,:ptv-dealwithit:good luck dragon
01-03-2019T16:59:40,SteelDragonFist,Trust me. I'm to slick.
01-03-2019T17:00:15,SteelDragonFist,I been working at my grocery job for about 15 years.
01-03-2019T17:01:43,CatzArt,Then you dont need luck but i wish you good luck anyway
01-03-2019T17:03:15,SteelDragonFist,Thanks Catz.
01-03-2019T17:03:36,SteelDragonFist,;)
01-03-2019T17:03:50,CatzArt,:ptv-victory:
01-03-2019T17:05:27,Dakina,"Sooo, killing turns a Nekomata on..."
01-03-2019T17:05:48,SageSaga,nope
01-03-2019T17:06:51,Dakina,Hmm. Guess I need to reread the latest chapter.
01-03-2019T17:07:40,sunblaze,kailyn turns a nekomata on I guess :D
01-03-2019T17:08:06,SageSaga,She's very frustrated and wants to take back some control
01-03-2019T17:08:34,sunblaze,^thats just a side effect :D
01-03-2019T17:08:36,SageSaga,also she sees Kaylin more as an equal
01-03-2019T17:09:08,SageSaga,and wants to reward her pet for a job well done :P
01-03-2019T17:10:13,SageSaga,Nekomata's have this trait where they like to play with their prey- but sometimes the get too attached to the prey the switch to a more protective nature and treat their former prey as a pet
01-03-2019T17:10:19,sunblaze,well noone complains about the turn of events
01-03-2019T17:10:57,sunblaze,and thats probably a good thing for the health of both
01-03-2019T17:12:04,Dakina,Thanks for the answer SageSaga.
01-03-2019T17:12:11,SageSaga,np
01-03-2019T17:14:06,SageSaga,oh that Said- Nyna does enjoy fighting- its not the killing that she likes but she sees it as a necessity because in her world- if you dont kill your enemy they come after you later and better prepared
01-03-2019T17:15:55,SageSaga,i think the page is done
01-03-2019T17:16:17,FoxxTrotter,Looks great. :0)
01-03-2019T17:16:41,CatzArt,Good work
01-03-2019T17:17:24,SageSaga,brb gotta grab something to eat- then im gonna work on the book cover
01-03-2019T17:17:31,Bgrmystr2,that last panel could probably be a little brighter. But otherwise page is a proper :ptv-ohmy: / 10
01-03-2019T17:18:44,FoxxTrotter,Okies.
01-03-2019T17:19:23,BadFoMo,Inb4 Villager: Ah! There's their camp! Now I can thank them properly and- Oh...
01-03-2019T17:26:41,sunblaze,ha I can see that :D
01-03-2019T17:29:27,SageSaga,the NPCs are in a house- they are posted up in a tent near the front of the house since it was a little too small for everyone
01-03-2019T17:30:32,CrRAR,lol @ Tom's stream offline image.
01-03-2019T17:30:40,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-keithdotdotdot:
01-03-2019T17:30:43,RimaDraws,oooh nice
01-03-2019T17:30:47,CrRAR,"♫ Oh where, oh where has my big wolfo gone, oh where oh where can he be? ♫"
01-03-2019T17:30:55,RimaDraws,<3
01-03-2019T17:31:08,CatzArt,Oh haha!
01-03-2019T17:31:10,RimaDraws,hi CrRAR
01-03-2019T17:31:34,CrRAR,Hi Rima! ^^
01-03-2019T17:32:39,RimaDraws,^^
01-03-2019T17:33:07,SageSaga,my lunch today- fried cheese and pepperonis
01-03-2019T17:33:15,RimaDraws,yummy
01-03-2019T17:33:19,CatzArt,Ohh foood
01-03-2019T17:35:44,RimaDraws,lol
01-03-2019T17:36:22,CrRAR,Sounds like 75% of a pizza sage.
01-03-2019T17:36:44,SageSaga,50%
01-03-2019T17:36:55,SageSaga,cant have bread and cant have tomatoes
01-03-2019T17:37:19,CrRAR,"Ah, yeah missing out on the carbs in the dough is smart."
01-03-2019T17:37:26,RimaDraws,diabetic?
01-03-2019T17:37:34,CrRAR,Skip tomatos because of the acidity?
01-03-2019T17:37:36,SageSaga,nah im not diabetic thankfully
01-03-2019T17:38:14,SageSaga,yeah i have acid reflux issues- pretty severe - ive got 3 medications i take for it - but they cant stop Tomatoes
01-03-2019T17:38:27,RimaDraws,oh wow sage ;;
01-03-2019T17:39:33,SageSaga,im also dieting to get my weight under control- ive lost over a hundred pounds so far
01-03-2019T17:39:49,RimaDraws,good job sage!
01-03-2019T17:39:59,RimaDraws,ive lost close to 15-18 pounds so far
01-03-2019T17:40:17,CrRAR,great progress the both of ya!
01-03-2019T17:40:48,RimaDraws,thanks
01-03-2019T17:43:22,CrRAR,also the cover(s)' coming out niiice sage!
01-03-2019T17:43:25,RimaDraws,you use clip sage?
01-03-2019T17:43:37,CrRAR,Very nice layout/composition.
01-03-2019T17:43:47,RimaDraws,it is nice. he does great work.
01-03-2019T17:44:04,SageSaga,yep i use Clip
01-03-2019T17:44:14,RimaDraws,i have it for certain things and love it
01-03-2019T17:44:30,RimaDraws,@CrRAR i did half of carmen in clip
01-03-2019T17:45:19,CrRAR,"nice, very good wind physics~"
01-03-2019T17:45:23,SageSaga,i find Photoshop to be too intensive for most illustration work. It's way better than it was though that's for sure- but Clip offers a simple and inexpensive solution
01-03-2019T17:45:45,SageSaga,it even has some fantastic features Photoshop doesnt have
01-03-2019T17:45:56,RimaDraws,i tried using photoshop but its expensive monthly and hard to use so i use Sai 2 and clip
01-03-2019T17:46:07,CrRAR,Yeah some PS tools can feel too... vague.
01-03-2019T17:46:35,CrRAR,"Like not fine tuned enough, but it give more control if you have the patience."
01-03-2019T17:46:43,CrRAR,*gives
01-03-2019T17:46:50,RimaDraws,yea i dont have patience for it lol
01-03-2019T18:02:39,Twokinds,I :heart: Photoshop
01-03-2019T18:03:33,SageSaga,i know- did they add a stabilizer to the brush tools?
01-03-2019T18:03:42,CrRAR,"Photo ""One Stop"" Shop"
01-03-2019T18:05:01,CrRAR,Like a realtime refiner like how Illustrator does?
01-03-2019T18:05:47,SageSaga,its not a big deal for Wacom tablets- they are so good at their job that its like drawing on paper
01-03-2019T18:06:07,SageSaga,but other tablets arent as good and a non-hand caused jitter can be created from the tablets
01-03-2019T18:06:22,SageSaga,so some form of line smoothing just straight up fixes that problem
01-03-2019T18:06:56,CrRAR,"interesting, makes sense."
01-03-2019T18:07:49,SageSaga,it's one of the reasons why once you go Wacom its hard to use anything else
01-03-2019T18:09:06,RimaDraws,i dont use wacom anymore
01-03-2019T18:09:15,Twokinds,They did add smoother options for brushes
01-03-2019T18:09:30,RimaDraws,i use an XP Pen 22E. i really wanted a cintiq so bad
01-03-2019T18:09:45,Twokinds,"Like pullstring, catch up, etc"
01-03-2019T18:09:50,SageSaga,they recently released a much cheaper Cintiq
01-03-2019T18:09:55,Twokinds,I never use them since it's not really necessary with a Cintiq
01-03-2019T18:10:08,Twokinds,All it does it add pen lag
01-03-2019T18:10:13,Twokinds,For me
01-03-2019T18:10:25,Twokinds,For someone with a cheaper tablet it'd be handy I imagine.
01-03-2019T18:10:44,RimaDraws,i just bought the xp pen last year so i cant afford to spend anything else lol
01-03-2019T18:11:54,RimaDraws,my graphics tablet was like something i needed to upgrade to because my poor wacom bamboo was going out
01-03-2019T18:12:49,CrRAR,"Yeah you can only push those Bamboos so hard, ahaha."
01-03-2019T18:13:35,Nekonny,o/
01-03-2019T18:13:39,CrRAR,\o
01-03-2019T18:13:53,SageSaga,yo Ron
01-03-2019T18:14:02,RimaDraws,hi nekonny!
01-03-2019T18:14:09,RimaDraws,i had my bamboo for.....
01-03-2019T18:14:20,RimaDraws,6-7 years i think
01-03-2019T18:14:23,Nekonny,You mean the 16' cintiq?
01-03-2019T18:14:29,Nekonny,I might actually go for that one
01-03-2019T18:14:31,SageSaga,yeah
01-03-2019T18:14:52,Nekonny,I'll miss the touchstrip and shortcut buttons of my current one though
01-03-2019T18:14:56,SageSaga,i still want a Mobile Studio Pro - 13 or 16 - i find 13 to be fine to work on
01-03-2019T18:15:26,SageSaga,also - driving a 4k screen seems expensive
01-03-2019T18:16:03,Nekonny,13 is a bit cramped. but it's been enough for me
01-03-2019T18:16:34,SageSaga,main reason i would be fine with the 13
01-03-2019T18:16:50,SageSaga,the 16 i would want is 3k while the 13 i want would be 2.1k
01-03-2019T18:17:00,SageSaga,so 900 dollars more is not worth it to me :P
01-03-2019T18:17:10,MatyMaty,"You gonna change your tablet, Neko?"
01-03-2019T18:17:43,Snapshothero,Hey nekonny ^^
01-03-2019T18:17:45,MatyMaty,I got an Ipad pro because supposedly was great for art. But I've barely used it x_x
01-03-2019T18:17:52,RimaDraws,aw this is cute nekonny! i didn't get to see it earlier since i went to sleep
01-03-2019T18:17:56,MatyMaty,I'm too used to my intuos
01-03-2019T18:18:00,Nekonny,I was thinking about it maty
01-03-2019T18:18:26,Nekonny,i thought the 16 was $600
01-03-2019T18:18:28,SageSaga,if clip studio wasnt a service on the ipad i would consider that
01-03-2019T18:18:38,Nekonny,"oh, you meant resolution"
01-03-2019T18:18:44,MatyMaty,It has a program called Procreate
01-03-2019T18:18:48,Tharkis,:ctharkis-earwiggle:
01-03-2019T18:18:51,MatyMaty,it is pretty good too
01-03-2019T18:18:52,SageSaga,no Ron i didnt
01-03-2019T18:19:01,SteelDragonFist,Hey there Nekonny.
01-03-2019T18:19:09,Nekonny,price?
01-03-2019T18:19:17,Nekonny,yo
01-03-2019T18:19:18,SageSaga,i was talking about the price of the MOBILE STUDIO PRO
01-03-2019T18:19:29,Nekonny,gotcha
01-03-2019T18:19:39,CrRAR,"lol Rima, I like the XP-Pen tablet's website, when you mouse of the XPPen logo it spins and the Shopping Cart looks overly caffeinated."
01-03-2019T18:19:43,MatyMaty,I saw an artist I follow saying the Mobile Studio Pro wasn't very good
01-03-2019T18:19:48,CrRAR,:ccrrar-coffee_flip:
01-03-2019T18:19:49,SageSaga,3000 USD for the i7 512GB 16 inch 4k screen
01-03-2019T18:19:50,CrRAR,They've got some rambunctious webdesigners.
01-03-2019T18:20:26,Nekonny,yeah thats out of my budget
01-03-2019T18:20:35,SteelDragonFist,That's a lot of moolah.
01-03-2019T18:20:35,SageSaga,I dont trust that Maty considering its a huge upgrade from the companion and the companion has been great
01-03-2019T18:21:34,CrRAR,I just wouldn't trust a computer the size of a laptop battery to be powerful enough for srs work.
01-03-2019T18:21:52,MatyMaty,I linked you the post in PM
01-03-2019T18:22:42,Nekonny,I need to come up with another arm position
01-03-2019T18:22:46,SageSaga,yeah that person didnt give any proper review and gave bad information
01-03-2019T18:23:17,SageSaga,"pretty much the only thing i would agree with is ""Poor battery life"""
01-03-2019T18:24:21,MatyMaty,oh
01-03-2019T18:25:05,Tharkis,"oooh ooh, maybe the Mr Atlas power flex"
01-03-2019T18:25:09,Tharkis,like ahnold
01-03-2019T18:25:14,MatyMaty,"I still want a cintiq, but I can't help but feel is overindulgent when I have that ipad pro I don't even use XO"
01-03-2019T18:25:37,sunblaze,zzzzzzz
01-03-2019T18:25:42,sunblaze,needs sleep
01-03-2019T18:25:49,sunblaze,I better go bye!
01-03-2019T18:25:51,CrRAR,:muscle:
01-03-2019T18:25:52,Nekonny,flex might be a bit much
01-03-2019T18:25:56,FoxxTrotter,"G'night, Sunblaze."
01-03-2019T18:25:57,CrRAR,bye sunblaze
01-03-2019T18:26:07,Nekonny,I was thinking more along the lines of a pose that could be used in conversation
01-03-2019T18:26:25,MatyMaty,"who's this lumberjack squirrel, Neko?"
01-03-2019T18:26:56,Nekonny,Jill
01-03-2019T18:27:01,SageSaga,gnight Sunblaze
01-03-2019T18:27:03,MatyMaty,HUH
01-03-2019T18:27:06,Nekonny,cya sun
01-03-2019T18:27:10,MatyMaty,she grew up :v
01-03-2019T18:27:25,Dakina,Hey Nekonny.
01-03-2019T18:27:35,Tharkis,"the 'i'm not saying aliens, but ... aliens' pose? =D"
01-03-2019T18:27:38,CrRAR,:sapling:
01-03-2019T18:27:44,CrRAR,:seedling:
01-03-2019T18:27:48,CrRAR,:evergreen_tree:
01-03-2019T18:27:49,Tharkis,(or 'and the fish as this big!' pose)
01-03-2019T18:27:51,Nekonny,I came up with her a few years ago
01-03-2019T18:28:00,SageSaga,also for one thing he missed- the Resolution on the Mobile studio is 1440p on the 13 and 4k on the 16
01-03-2019T18:28:15,SageSaga,and the battery lasts for 4 hours not 2
01-03-2019T18:29:17,SageSaga,"he spent around 2000 dollars to make the cintiq he had ""portable"" too"
01-03-2019T18:29:30,Tharkis,4 hours is only if you turn the brightness way down though hehe
01-03-2019T18:29:43,MatyMaty,"well ""portable"" sounds kinda optimistic"
01-03-2019T18:29:50,Tharkis,"spent last weekend with TGwonder at a con and he's got the mobile studio, it's nice, and it is portable"
01-03-2019T18:29:55,MatyMaty,he has to carry around a laptop and two power banks
01-03-2019T18:29:59,Tharkis,but the battery life isnt so hot
01-03-2019T18:30:13,SageSaga,yeah the only down side to the mobile studio is the battery life
01-03-2019T18:30:27,SageSaga,but you dont need to lie about the battery life being twice as bad as it already is XD
01-03-2019T18:30:30,MatyMaty,I've also read it heats up a LOT
01-03-2019T18:30:30,Tharkis,enough to go from place to place and find another outlet but not so long use for say drawing in a plane or something
01-03-2019T18:30:37,MatyMaty,but I dunno if that's important
01-03-2019T18:30:57,SageSaga,"i heard people say that but then everyone I hear who actually tests it says ""uhh- no - its warm- but not hot"""
01-03-2019T18:31:24,Tharkis,heat probably depends on how yo use it
01-03-2019T18:31:30,SageSaga,"one guy said ""I can't see people finding it uncomfortable, but i live in the far north so I love it"" XD"
01-03-2019T18:31:49,Tharkis,"if you sit it on your lap, i can see it getting hot"
01-03-2019T18:32:16,Tharkis,wonder and Jen use the mobile studio in easel mode with the built in stand
01-03-2019T18:32:19,Tharkis,and sit it on a table
01-03-2019T18:32:34,Dadrobit,Howdy y'all.
01-03-2019T18:32:39,FoxxTrotter,"Hi, Dadrobit."
01-03-2019T18:32:49,SageSaga,oh and he can just use that battery brick on the Mobile studio
01-03-2019T18:33:27,RimaDraws,hi dadro
01-03-2019T18:34:18,CrRAR,howdy robit
01-03-2019T18:34:35,CrRAR,how's the day?
01-03-2019T18:34:44,Dadrobit,"Saw that Cintiq released a more ""affordable"" screen tablet. I wonder how much all the off brand stuff and their own cheaper tablets forced this?"
01-03-2019T18:35:04,Dadrobit,And pretty solid so far CrRar
01-03-2019T18:35:10,CrRAR,probably a lot lol
01-03-2019T18:35:22,Dadrobit,"HP Pen, Huion, etc."
01-03-2019T18:35:27,MatyMaty,I was thinking that panel where you can see Nyna's butt would be super NSFW if it werent for the tail placement :P
01-03-2019T18:35:30,Dadrobit,XP PEn*
01-03-2019T18:35:37,RimaDraws,yea XP Pen
01-03-2019T18:35:38,Dadrobit,close enough
01-03-2019T18:35:48,MatyMaty,the cheap cintiq is literally a Huion
01-03-2019T18:35:53,MatyMaty,at a higher price
01-03-2019T18:35:59,MatyMaty,at least that is what I've read
01-03-2019T18:36:14,Nekonny,I need a ref for this arm ^_^'
01-03-2019T18:36:17,Dadrobit,Literally as in Cintiq outsourced production to the same company?
01-03-2019T18:36:19,SageSaga,not what i read
01-03-2019T18:36:27,SteelDragonFist,I need me a new art tablet myself.
01-03-2019T18:36:29,Dadrobit,Or literally as in the same general specs?
01-03-2019T18:37:13,SageSaga,it uses the same Wacom Pen which is a huge bonus immediately
01-03-2019T18:37:41,SageSaga,it doesnt use an etched glass screen though- so thats a small quality drop
01-03-2019T18:37:44,MatyMaty,I don't think the pen is worth the extra price over a XP Pen or Huion :P
01-03-2019T18:38:25,MatyMaty,it also has very low res compared to other tables of the same price
01-03-2019T18:38:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Lunch time what’s crackin
01-03-2019T18:38:45,SageSaga,what?
01-03-2019T18:38:48,SteelDragonFist,There's so many expensive art tablets nowadays.
01-03-2019T18:39:03,SageSaga,it's got the same res at the tablet im using right now
01-03-2019T18:39:15,MatyMaty,well yes Sage
01-03-2019T18:39:26,MatyMaty,but you got your table a while ago
01-03-2019T18:39:31,MatyMaty,tablet*
01-03-2019T18:39:43,SageSaga,it wasnt that long ago and its still the standard
01-03-2019T18:40:11,Dadrobit,Question for Cintiq users that may be in the chat. How is their support system? Forums? Immediate chat options?
01-03-2019T18:40:24,SageSaga,the Huion 19 inch tablet is the same res too
01-03-2019T18:40:31,MatyMaty,well one thing I know is that Wacom is WAY better at that
01-03-2019T18:40:42,MatyMaty,since it isn't a chinese company
01-03-2019T18:41:02,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I've heard horror stories from Huion."
01-03-2019T18:41:03,MatyMaty,also Huion and other chines brands can be a nightmare driver wise
01-03-2019T18:41:11,MatyMaty,chinese*
01-03-2019T18:41:26,SageSaga,the XP Pen Artist 22 pro is 1080 too
01-03-2019T18:41:27,CrRAR,lol as if Wacom hasn't been bad enough in the driver department
01-03-2019T18:41:43,MatyMaty,I've never had wacom driver issues :o
01-03-2019T18:41:44,CrRAR,"but WORSE... oh, oh dear xD"
01-03-2019T18:42:00,Dakina,"My Cintiq suffers a ""tablet driver not found"" error one out of five times."
01-03-2019T18:42:09,CrRAR,yeah I just heard stories too
01-03-2019T18:42:28,CrRAR,Dakina: case in point haha
01-03-2019T18:43:28,CrRAR,"lol Nekonny, are those Anchor-brand Anchor Arms?"
01-03-2019T18:43:41,SageSaga,what drawing tablets have a standard tablet that is higher than 1080p besides Wacom?
01-03-2019T18:43:42,Nekonny,howcome? XD
01-03-2019T18:43:46,RimaDraws,stronk squirrely
01-03-2019T18:43:56,MatyMaty,"I think none, Sage. I was wrong :P"
01-03-2019T18:44:01,AshnardSQRL,Those muscles <3
01-03-2019T18:44:07,RimaDraws,or is she a chipmunk?
01-03-2019T18:44:18,MatyMaty,I was just told that back whren the Cintiq 16 was announced since I wanted to get it
01-03-2019T18:44:22,AshnardSQRL,Excellent proportions in the arm muscles.
01-03-2019T18:44:48,CrRAR,indeed
01-03-2019T18:44:51,SageSaga,the Cintiq 16 does have a resolution drop from the Cintiq 16 Pro
01-03-2019T18:45:04,SageSaga,but thats not a bad thing- honestly 4k on a 16 is kinda dumb
01-03-2019T18:45:17,CrRAR,gosh arms look so STRANGE all by themselves. >:
01-03-2019T18:45:38,RimaDraws,nah
01-03-2019T18:45:42,RimaDraws,they look good
01-03-2019T18:45:54,CrRAR,"""Please keep your arms and legs attached at all times. Thank you!"""
01-03-2019T18:46:12,SageSaga,i think they should save some money and only do 1440p on anything under 22 inches
01-03-2019T18:46:37,CrRAR,"""...and seats and tray tables in the upright and locked positions *krssht*"""
01-03-2019T18:46:44,Nekonny,turns sages audio
01-03-2019T18:46:53,BadFoMo,@CrRAR Haha.
01-03-2019T18:48:30,Kullax,:ckullax-fortes: hey hey hey
01-03-2019T18:48:34,CrRAR,ello
01-03-2019T18:48:41,SpazztasticKiwi,The bushiest of tails
01-03-2019T18:48:54,CrRAR,Jill gets a boop to the face.
01-03-2019T18:48:55,MatyMaty,"Mmmmm Sage if it were you, what would you do? Buy a Huion/XP pen, a small cintiq or keep saving for like a Pro 24"
01-03-2019T18:48:58,MatyMaty,?
01-03-2019T18:49:08,Kullax,Sage: yes
01-03-2019T18:49:22,Nekonny,"dang, I need to reorder my layers..."
01-03-2019T18:49:24,SageSaga,i personally wouldnt bother with a 24 inch cintiq
01-03-2019T18:49:35,MatyMaty,Ooh okay
01-03-2019T18:49:36,SageSaga,that said!
01-03-2019T18:49:56,Nekonny,which can be a problem with this program....
01-03-2019T18:50:00,SageSaga,If you are a person that likes to work on a larger surface and use your arm more- i think  a bigger tablet is better
01-03-2019T18:50:03,CrRAR,oh dear
01-03-2019T18:50:04,MatyMaty,erases it from Sage's b-day present options
01-03-2019T18:50:06,SageSaga,certainly better for your wrist
01-03-2019T18:50:16,Nekonny,o_O
01-03-2019T18:50:23,CrRAR,"beeg screen, B R O A D strokes"
01-03-2019T18:50:29,Nekonny,reminda maty that his bday is  on the 5th
01-03-2019T18:50:39,SageSaga,the biggest I would go is a 16 inch for myself- but thats just personal preference
01-03-2019T18:50:39,MatyMaty,well I use an Intuos Pro L :o I'm kinda used to moving all my arm
01-03-2019T18:50:45,Nekonny,gimmegimme
01-03-2019T18:50:46,CrRAR,"diff'rnt strokes, diff'rent folks~"
01-03-2019T18:50:55,MatyMaty,"I'll get you a book on drawing H stuff, Neko"
01-03-2019T18:51:02,Tharkis,nekonny will be old in 3 days ! /panic /scream
01-03-2019T18:51:03,Nekonny,>.>
01-03-2019T18:51:11,Tharkis,:ctharkis-ewok:
01-03-2019T18:51:12,SageSaga,whats the active area of the Pro L?
01-03-2019T18:51:55,MatyMaty,12 x 84
01-03-2019T18:52:01,MatyMaty,"8,4"
01-03-2019T18:52:03,MatyMaty,geez
01-03-2019T18:52:33,SageSaga,8.4?
01-03-2019T18:52:39,MatyMaty,yus
01-03-2019T18:53:09,SageSaga,so its a little bigger than a standard sheet of paper
01-03-2019T18:53:20,SageSaga,if you are fine with that- a 16 should be good right?
01-03-2019T18:53:38,MatyMaty,I think so! also it would be better to fit on my desk :P
01-03-2019T18:53:47,SageSaga,a 13 inch is a tiny bit smaller than a sheet of paper
01-03-2019T18:53:58,SageSaga,so a 16 should be good
01-03-2019T18:54:14,MatyMaty,Okay!
01-03-2019T18:54:40,SageSaga,there is one issue i have with the cintiq 16 though
01-03-2019T18:54:52,SageSaga,no touch
01-03-2019T18:55:14,SageSaga,palm rejection on the cintiqs seems pretty good thanks to the pen
01-03-2019T18:55:16,Nekonny,"yeah, that sucks"
01-03-2019T18:55:19,MatyMaty,I don't really use the touch option on the intuos
01-03-2019T18:55:25,SageSaga,but i use touch allllll the time
01-03-2019T18:55:27,Nekonny,"oh, not that"
01-03-2019T18:55:36,MatyMaty,I like to use a keypad instead
01-03-2019T18:55:43,Nekonny,I wish they had put some touchstrips behind the monitor
01-03-2019T18:55:49,MatyMaty,it feels more intuitive for me
01-03-2019T18:56:04,MatyMaty,Get a keypad Neko
01-03-2019T18:56:26,SageSaga,this is why i love touch
01-03-2019T18:57:34,SageSaga,being able to pinch zoom and rotate by just moving my fingers on the screen- its like flipping around a piece of paper
01-03-2019T18:58:02,MatyMaty,with a keypad you just have to push two keys with your left hand :P
01-03-2019T18:58:20,MatyMaty,and you can move through tools and change the brush size too
01-03-2019T18:58:29,AshnardSQRL,I see that she has evolved into Spiral from the X-Men.
01-03-2019T18:58:36,MatyMaty,without having to move the stylus to the toolbars
01-03-2019T18:58:52,Nekonny,touch would be cool yeah...
01-03-2019T18:58:55,Nekonny,seeing it that way
01-03-2019T18:59:02,SageSaga,i can do most of that with my express keys or with pressure
01-03-2019T18:59:09,Nekonny,but I had issues using touch on the bamboo
01-03-2019T18:59:15,Nekonny,I guess it takes some getting used to
01-03-2019T19:05:15,CrRAR,ooo love Nyna's eyes.
01-03-2019T19:05:23,CrRAR,:ptv-excited:
01-03-2019T19:05:29,CrRAR,Both their eyes~
01-03-2019T19:07:30,ArtofZod,:cartofzod-c1:
01-03-2019T19:07:52,Nekonny,I can't translate this T_T
01-03-2019T19:08:20,RimaDraws,oh my
01-03-2019T19:08:31,BadFoMo,Lean your head to the right?
01-03-2019T19:09:03,Azumachan,:ctwokinds-floraquestion::tea:
01-03-2019T19:09:17,Shaze,Left and right type bahts Priority range: Both sides Left and right type bahts Priority range: Left side Right / left type Baht Priority range: Right side
01-03-2019T19:09:28,BadFoMo,//NotTrolling try Google Translate?
01-03-2019T19:09:59,Nekonny,that doesnt make any sense T_T
01-03-2019T19:10:17,Nekonny,what is a baht?
01-03-2019T19:10:49,BadFoMo,To the Internet!
01-03-2019T19:11:39,MatyMaty,Thailand's currency?
01-03-2019T19:12:53,Nekonny,XD
01-03-2019T19:13:07,Nekonny,in context maty :P
01-03-2019T19:13:45,SageSaga,a mistranslation?
01-03-2019T19:15:24,SageSaga,how's this?
01-03-2019T19:15:35,Dakina,"Got to go, have a good stream SageSaga and Nekonny."
01-03-2019T19:15:38,Nekonny,most likely
01-03-2019T19:15:44,Nekonny,cya dak!
01-03-2019T19:15:47,SageSaga,take care Dakina
01-03-2019T19:16:26,FoxxTrotter,"C-ya, Dakina."
01-03-2019T19:16:43,FoxxTrotter,"Hi, Spud God."
01-03-2019T19:16:48,SageSaga,her arms are like my arms
01-03-2019T19:16:55,MrRetroRealm,Greetings :3
01-03-2019T19:17:03,FoxxTrotter,"Hi, Retro."
01-03-2019T19:17:25,FoxxTrotter,"BRB, food time. :0)"
01-03-2019T19:17:26,MrRetroRealm,How is everyone?
01-03-2019T19:17:44,RimaDraws,good.
01-03-2019T19:18:02,Twokinds,Cover looks nice
01-03-2019T19:18:14,RimaDraws,it does!
01-03-2019T19:18:18,SageSaga,ty
01-03-2019T19:18:18,MrRetroRealm,Nekonny is pretty good at animating.
01-03-2019T19:18:35,Nekonny,"its not really animating, but thanks"
01-03-2019T19:18:48,SageSaga,Nekonny said it so i dont have to
01-03-2019T19:18:53,Nekonny,If I could capture the rotation without having to deal with the distortion...
01-03-2019T19:19:02,SageSaga,I would call it Puppeteering
01-03-2019T19:19:23,MrRetroRealm,"May I ask you a question, Nekonny?"
01-03-2019T19:19:59,SageSaga,if the answer was no he couldnt say no
01-03-2019T19:20:14,MrRetroRealm,Ah
01-03-2019T19:20:25,Nekonny,sure
01-03-2019T19:20:32,MrRetroRealm,Well I was wondering if he does commission of these animations
01-03-2019T19:20:39,Nekonny,and sage is about right
01-03-2019T19:20:56,Nekonny,Although the movement phase I guess could be called animating?
01-03-2019T19:21:22,MatyMaty,I can sketch the rotating motion later if you want Neko
01-03-2019T19:21:27,Tharkis,"hrm, i think the technical term is 'rigging' but ... its been too long since i had any classes mentioning it"
01-03-2019T19:21:28,SageSaga,"you create puppets and ""animate"" them but its not the same as ""animation"""
01-03-2019T19:21:29,MatyMaty,"dunno if it would help, though"
01-03-2019T19:21:36,Nekonny,no
01-03-2019T19:21:46,Nekonny,theres a few ways to do this
01-03-2019T19:21:53,Nekonny,manually yeilds the best results
01-03-2019T19:21:58,Nekonny,but also takes the longest
01-03-2019T19:23:10,SageSaga,"Maty, when Nyna butt?"
01-03-2019T19:23:53,MatyMaty,"oh yes, Nyna butt!"
01-03-2019T19:24:23,MatyMaty,so you can finally remove Rem XD
01-03-2019T19:24:23,MrRetroRealm,Back
01-03-2019T19:24:48,SageSaga,ending stream when song ends
01-03-2019T19:25:01,FoxxTrotter,"OK, Sage. Thanks for the stream."
01-03-2019T19:25:07,Tharkis,"okies, thanks forthe stream sage!"
01-03-2019T19:25:19,FoxxTrotter,Just in time for Wondork to start.
01-03-2019T19:25:46,MrRetroRealm,"Now, Neko, do you do commissions of these as well? If you don't mind me asking, of course."
01-03-2019T19:26:04,SageSaga,"was hoping for Nyna butt for birthday, then was hoping for Nyna butt for Christmas, now hope for Nyna butt for Birthday again :P"
01-03-2019T19:26:20,MatyMaty,sorreeeeh ;w;

01-03-2019T19:30:00,MrRetroRealm,Is there by any chance you're interested in doing another commission of this variety? Again if you don't mind me asking.
01-03-2019T19:34:00,Shaze,Was it that Bowsette for me?
01-03-2019T19:34:23,AshnardSQRL,Heading off now.  The rig is looking great so far.  Thanks for the stream!

01-03-2019T23:34:41,MrRetroRealm,"Wow you had quite a few loops already set for front, huh O.o"
01-03-2019T23:35:26,Ordithus,He's been making these animations for a while now.  This software looks pretty reusable
01-03-2019T23:35:31,Nekonny,"I have a few default ones, and a ton ive made myself"
01-03-2019T23:35:38,MrRetroRealm,Too bad is not in english
