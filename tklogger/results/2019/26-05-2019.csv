26-05-2019T00:00:31,Ordithus,Me too
26-05-2019T00:00:48,Bgrmystr2,I had a job at a tech shop nearby where I lived not long ago
26-05-2019T00:00:58,Bgrmystr2,since moved recently
26-05-2019T00:01:22,Bgrmystr2,but the shop went under due to the primary advertiser stealing money from the store
26-05-2019T00:02:23,Bgrmystr2,was a sad day
26-05-2019T00:05:15,Bgrmystr2,"was kinda difficult sometimes, being the only person in the shop a lot of times"
26-05-2019T00:05:20,Ordithus,mowing took a lot out of me today
26-05-2019T00:05:26,Ordithus,must sleep

26-05-2019T02:02:22,DarthRexKing,goodnight!
26-05-2019T02:22:45,SamuelLeumas,It is wrong that I'm tempted to suggest a (keidran) nibbly character sheet next week?

26-05-2019T11:12:33,AspiringNoodle,They're about to be more ded than Red in the follow-up xD
26-05-2019T11:16:16,CrimsonQuill,Hi

26-05-2019T11:39:00,TeapotOfDoom,Hello there people!
26-05-2019T11:39:12,TeapotOfDoom,I heard Intel has the big ded
26-05-2019T11:40:34,AspiringNoodle,Very much ded
26-05-2019T11:40:36,AspiringNoodle,So ded
26-05-2019T11:40:38,AspiringNoodle,All the ded
26-05-2019T11:41:20,TerraTheWizard,[x[ doubt
26-05-2019T11:41:23,TerraTheWizard,ah heck
26-05-2019T11:41:28,TerraTheWizard,i messed up that bracket
26-05-2019T11:41:33,AspiringNoodle,I want to build a computer that will last 10 years while being relevant
26-05-2019T11:41:38,TeapotOfDoom,I have not seen any demos yet but i heard something about 12% IPC improvement
26-05-2019T11:41:58,TerraTheWizard,nothing lasts 10 years these days
26-05-2019T11:41:58,AspiringNoodle,"Now I'm worried that AMD is going to kick so much booty, that in 5 years processors will be drastically difference"
26-05-2019T11:42:03,TerraTheWizard,at the speed stuff improves
26-05-2019T11:42:08,TeapotOfDoom,Good luck with that. I would use the biggest Threadripper money can buy
26-05-2019T11:42:08,AspiringNoodle,15% :D
26-05-2019T11:42:25,TeapotOfDoom,15???
26-05-2019T11:42:27,AspiringNoodle,With double the cache and double the floating point performance (only relevant to professional workloads)
26-05-2019T11:42:35,TeapotOfDoom,*breath in*
26-05-2019T11:42:41,TeapotOfDoom,BOI
26-05-2019T11:42:55,TerraTheWizard,people: amd is good
26-05-2019T11:43:03,AspiringNoodle,Aaaaaaaand they're offering a 12 core processor for $500 :ptv-hearts:
26-05-2019T11:43:08,TerraTheWizard,me: *every amd i've ever owned was mr bsod*
26-05-2019T11:43:09,TeapotOfDoom,Well cache can be good or bad depending on the workload but mostly good
26-05-2019T11:43:44,TeapotOfDoom,I have built 3 Amd systems so far and exept for one they all were good
26-05-2019T11:44:02,TeapotOfDoom,On the third one the motherboard had issues
26-05-2019T11:44:15,AspiringNoodle,They're officially on-par with Intel's single-thread performance now.  Pending overclockability
26-05-2019T11:44:21,TeapotOfDoom,Mr BSoD
26-05-2019T11:44:29,TeapotOfDoom,Cool but horrifying name for a PC
26-05-2019T11:44:57,TeapotOfDoom,They switched from Samsung low power to TSMC high performance process
26-05-2019T11:45:12,TerraTheWizard,two intel ones loved to bsod
26-05-2019T11:45:18,TerraTheWizard,and all 3 amd ones
26-05-2019T11:45:22,AspiringNoodle,I wonder how hard it would be to build an orange/brown/yellow build.
26-05-2019T11:45:29,TeapotOfDoom,So overclockability will be through the roof compared to last gen
26-05-2019T11:45:36,AspiringNoodle,"In honor of Love Zap, hahahaha"
26-05-2019T11:45:44,TeapotOfDoom,Hahaha
26-05-2019T11:45:48,TeapotOfDoom,Good point
26-05-2019T11:45:58,TeapotOfDoom,Maybe I will post a part list
26-05-2019T11:46:39,AspiringNoodle,At least we know when Zen2 is launching now.
26-05-2019T11:46:42,TeapotOfDoom,Do you build systems for other people as well Terra?
26-05-2019T11:46:59,TeapotOfDoom,Waited since christmas for that
26-05-2019T11:47:52,AspiringNoodle,"Going forward, I have a budgeted saving plan.  But the past few years have been a scramble to build up funds for a PC"
26-05-2019T11:47:59,AspiringNoodle,I'm glad it's taken this long
26-05-2019T11:48:51,TeapotOfDoom,You've already got our configuration?
26-05-2019T11:49:01,TeapotOfDoom,Or still saving?
26-05-2019T11:49:29,AspiringNoodle,"I had a fair bit of money since Christmas, but I knew that the next-gen launch was coming up, so I waited."
26-05-2019T11:50:07,AspiringNoodle,"As much as I would've loved to be an early adopter and get a first-gen Ryzen CPU, I couldn't be more excited to start with 3rd gen :ptv-hearts:"
26-05-2019T11:50:44,TeapotOfDoom,Yep also stalled a project for Zen2
26-05-2019T11:51:00,TeapotOfDoom,Will be white/black/copper
26-05-2019T11:51:31,AspiringNoodle,I'm fluctuating on what color scheme I want.
26-05-2019T11:51:52,TeapotOfDoom,"I'm so looking forward. We will probably construct custom waterblocks for CPU, VRM, GPU and Chipset since the X570 chip needs active cooling"
26-05-2019T11:52:01,AspiringNoodle,"Was originally going to be a black/dark grey/orange red for AMD.  Then I considered black/white, maybe with violet RGB?"
26-05-2019T11:52:28,AspiringNoodle,Now I'm thinking the impossible due to color stream night xD
26-05-2019T11:52:51,TeapotOfDoom,Orange/yellow is possible imo
26-05-2019T11:53:13,TeapotOfDoom,I would go for white base and orange accents. then go for yellow leds
26-05-2019T11:53:58,AspiringNoodle,"I would say brown lighting from the fans, but that would probably look ugly!"
26-05-2019T11:55:11,TeapotOfDoom,nah
26-05-2019T11:55:39,TeapotOfDoom,wait till you see i've got an idea
26-05-2019T11:56:13,TeapotOfDoom,what's your price range?
26-05-2019T12:14:49,TeapotOfDoom,ok good to know. So if you're using the system for work (and i guess you don't have a seperate nas) i would at least go for raid
26-05-2019T12:14:55,TeapotOfDoom,whoops
26-05-2019T12:22:15,AspiringNoodle,What'll be annoying is keeping both a system image and a copy of the files up to date :p
26-05-2019T12:22:28,AspiringNoodle,"Dangit, now I'm doing it too.  I blame Reni."
26-05-2019T12:34:15,AspiringNoodle,...I went down the WoW hole for 13 years ._.
26-05-2019T12:34:21,AspiringNoodle,"Dangit, again?"
26-05-2019T12:34:32,TeapotOfDoom,Reni why u do dis?
26-05-2019T12:39:50,TeapotOfDoom,will maybe require some illustrator work
26-05-2019T12:39:55,TeapotOfDoom,damnit
26-05-2019T12:40:00,TeapotOfDoom,R E N I
26-05-2019T12:40:04,AspiringNoodle,Reni's curse is real
26-05-2019T12:43:20,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
26-05-2019T12:44:06,TeapotOfDoom,Don't ask
26-05-2019T13:00:02,TeapotOfDoom,Well I'm off now. Dinner will be ready in a few minutes. Bye everyone!
26-05-2019T13:00:37,AspiringNoodle,Here's hoping I don't die waiting for Zen 2's launch :P
26-05-2019T13:00:51,AspiringNoodle,"Also, don't choke ;D"
26-05-2019T13:01:06,TeapotOfDoom,I'll try my best ^^

26-05-2019T16:03:27,CrimsonQuill,Oooch
26-05-2019T16:12:27,TeapotOfDoom,What cake did you order?
26-05-2019T16:54:07,Twokinds,:cake:
26-05-2019T16:54:22,Twokinds,"Kiwi, can I get an ice cream cake?"
26-05-2019T17:00:29,TeapotOfDoom,I recently bought ice cream which seems to not melt. I don't trust it
26-05-2019T17:00:50,CrimsonQuill,It's one of Willy Wonka's unmeltable ice creams.
26-05-2019T17:00:55,CrimsonQuill,:D
26-05-2019T17:01:57,TeapotOfDoom,I tastes like you're eating pure whipped cream thickened up with a chemical feeling vanilla taste
26-05-2019T17:02:29,TeapotOfDoom,Really not great
26-05-2019T17:02:46,TeapotOfDoom,And the not melting part just made it worse
26-05-2019T17:02:55,CrimsonQuill,Then it must be one of Mr Blortle's frauds instead.
26-05-2019T17:03:01,TeapotOfDoom,Probably
26-05-2019T17:03:02,CrimsonQuill,Or was it Slugworth?
26-05-2019T17:03:05,CrimsonQuill,Can't remember
26-05-2019T17:03:25,TeapotOfDoom,Anyway it will get kicked out of the freezer
26-05-2019T17:03:26,Bgrmystr2,slugworth I think
26-05-2019T17:03:34,Bgrmystr2,dunno who the fuck blortle is
26-05-2019T17:03:57,CrimsonQuill,"Probably gibberish trying to turn into false memory, Bgr. Hello"

26-05-2019T17:05:09,TeapotOfDoom,Seems like quite the party in here
26-05-2019T17:05:53,TeapotOfDoom,Good distraction from reading an 80 page data sheet
26-05-2019T17:06:12,CrimsonQuill,What sort of Data sheet?
26-05-2019T17:06:41,TeapotOfDoom,Keyboard matrix encoder
26-05-2019T17:06:49,CrimsonQuill,Aaaagh
26-05-2019T17:07:03,CrimsonQuill,I can't handle matrices
26-05-2019T17:07:09,CrimsonQuill,Especially in Least Squares
26-05-2019T17:07:27,TeapotOfDoom,Well after your last exam spree I can definitely relate
26-05-2019T17:07:37,CrimsonQuill,:D
26-05-2019T17:07:43,TeapotOfDoom,This one's different though
26-05-2019T17:07:55,CrimsonQuill,Gaussian theory matrices?
26-05-2019T17:08:21,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
26-05-2019T17:08:33,TeapotOfDoom,You put your keyboard switches in a grid and test if anyone of them is pressed. Then you translate that into the human interface protocol of USB and send it to the computer
26-05-2019T17:08:43,CrimsonQuill,"Oh, I see."
26-05-2019T17:08:48,TeapotOfDoom,Yeah...
26-05-2019T17:08:50,CrimsonQuill,I think...
26-05-2019T17:08:51,TeapotOfDoom,fun stuff
26-05-2019T17:08:54,CrimsonQuill,I don't really...
26-05-2019T17:09:01,TeapotOfDoom,No problem
26-05-2019T17:09:02,CrimsonQuill,It does sound tricky thought.
26-05-2019T17:09:04,CrimsonQuill,though.
26-05-2019T17:09:35,TeapotOfDoom,I think saying that the data sheet is 80 pages long says enough about the thing
26-05-2019T17:10:22,TeapotOfDoom,In other words: I'm trying to build a keyboard
26-05-2019T17:10:41,CrimsonQuill,shudders at the thought
26-05-2019T17:11:12,Bgrmystr2,lol teapot you could have jusdt opened with that.
26-05-2019T17:11:31,TeapotOfDoom,Sry started ranting
26-05-2019T17:13:53,AspiringNoodle,I remember a few weeks ago ranting about food being annoying and how I wish there we just tiny little food cubes that could meet nutritional requirements AND keep me full for a while.
26-05-2019T17:14:04,AspiringNoodle,"And wouldn't you know it, new product.  Ahahahaha"
26-05-2019T17:14:37,CrimsonQuill,Woah.
26-05-2019T17:14:49,TeapotOfDoom,But does it exist?
26-05-2019T17:14:57,AspiringNoodle,Kinda.  And it has the best name!
26-05-2019T17:15:02,AspiringNoodle,Soylent Squared :D
26-05-2019T17:15:12,TerraTheWizard,so is it made from people?
26-05-2019T17:15:21,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-keith8D:
26-05-2019T17:15:22,AspiringNoodle,"Sadly, no.  Plants."
26-05-2019T17:15:49,AspiringNoodle,"Their website says 1 - 2 for a snack, 3 - 4 for a meal."
26-05-2019T17:16:02,Bgrmystr2,it's cute people still think it's made from people when that's always been obviously bogus XD
26-05-2019T17:16:07,AspiringNoodle,"I think I'll eat enough where if I stacked them on top of each other, it'd be a cube :3"
26-05-2019T17:16:18,Bgrmystr2,I've been tempted to try it honestly
26-05-2019T17:16:23,Bgrmystr2,"at it's core, it works"
26-05-2019T17:16:29,Bgrmystr2,it's just different for everynoe
26-05-2019T17:16:36,Bgrmystr2,cuz of body types and stuff
26-05-2019T17:16:57,AspiringNoodle,"Oh my, looks like I only need to eat 3 bars to get my food cube"
26-05-2019T17:18:05,AspiringNoodle,"""Your time is at a premium and that sometimes means skipping meals or settling for unhealthy food choices. Soylent Squared offers convenient and perfectly portioned nutrition on-the-go allowing you to design the meal you need when you need it."""
26-05-2019T17:18:12,AspiringNoodle,They get me ;w;
26-05-2019T17:18:25,Bgrmystr2,yeah but that's average for people
26-05-2019T17:18:39,Bgrmystr2,that does not take into account if someone has high sugars or something already in their body
26-05-2019T17:18:58,Bgrmystr2,which could be extremely fatal for someone not bothering to know exactly the contents they need from it.
26-05-2019T17:19:08,Bgrmystr2,"it's really, really damn important"
26-05-2019T17:20:50,TeapotOfDoom,It's straightup lembas
26-05-2019T17:22:51,AspiringNoodle,"At a $1 per square, that's not bad xD"
26-05-2019T17:22:58,Bgrmystr2,yeah honestly
26-05-2019T17:23:09,Bgrmystr2,it's only made of the core materials you need for your body to survive each day
26-05-2019T17:23:14,TeapotOfDoom,That means 3$ for a complete meal
26-05-2019T17:23:15,TeapotOfDoom,Nice
26-05-2019T17:23:26,AspiringNoodle,And looking at the nutrients that are in it... seems like a bit of an upgrade from my current diet ^^;
26-05-2019T17:24:01,TeapotOfDoom,But wasn't there something about that not being completely healthy because of possible digestive problems?
26-05-2019T17:24:26,TeapotOfDoom,I mean I could be mistaken
26-05-2019T17:25:27,AspiringNoodle,Not sure.  The bars have probiotics and a fair bit of fiber in them.
26-05-2019T17:26:14,Bgrmystr2,"there's a lot of debates on it, teapot"
26-05-2019T17:26:51,Bgrmystr2,"but what people call ""healthy"" and what they claim as ""healthy"" against something that's using science as a backing is always questionable from the get-go"

26-05-2019T17:30:06,Bgrmystr2,nope

26-05-2019T17:31:32,TeapotOfDoom,@AspiringNoodle how bad is it?
26-05-2019T17:32:14,AspiringNoodle,The movie itself was mediocre by Marvel standards.  Like they went back in time to the Iron Man / Thor 1 days
26-05-2019T17:32:26,AspiringNoodle,"But overall, entertaining."
26-05-2019T17:32:46,AspiringNoodle,There's a scene early on that's midly amusing.  But there's an extended version of the scene...
26-05-2019T17:32:54,AspiringNoodle,"If they had shown that in theaters, you might've had people walking out."
26-05-2019T17:33:10,TeapotOfDoom,Why that?
26-05-2019T17:33:25,AspiringNoodle,"First off, it's one of those cringey ""feminist"" moments."
26-05-2019T17:34:17,AspiringNoodle,"Marvel is trying to figure out where she needs to head next while at a strip mall.  Guy on a bike pulling in asks her if she could smile for him.  She gets a bit indignant, but not much comes of it."
26-05-2019T17:35:00,AspiringNoodle,"then they jump cut to her in new clothes, a now naked mannequin, and her riding away on the guy's bike. (And yes, the guy did come off as a douche, so this is mildly funny)"
26-05-2019T17:35:39,AspiringNoodle,"Extended version: She TORTURES the guy, threatens to remove his hand, and that if he wants to keep it he needs to give her the keys to his bike"
26-05-2019T17:35:44,AspiringNoodle,And she's SMILING while doing this!
26-05-2019T17:36:03,TeapotOfDoom,WUT
26-05-2019T17:36:03,AspiringNoodle,"THAT'S STRAIGHT UP VILLAIN BEHAVIOR.  WHAT THE HELL MARVEL, YOU EXPECT THAT TO BE A ROLE MODEL???"
26-05-2019T17:36:30,TeapotOfDoom,"Yeah, fuck men. What did they do for us anyway?"
26-05-2019T17:36:42,AspiringNoodle,And they seriously want HER to be the new face of the MCU...
26-05-2019T17:36:59,TeapotOfDoom,Good thing they cut that
26-05-2019T17:37:11,AspiringNoodle,"Well, it's out there now.  Her character is tainted."
26-05-2019T17:37:29,TeapotOfDoom,Srsly wtf?
26-05-2019T17:37:47,AspiringNoodle,"Also, given Ms. Larson's *ahem* political leanings... she probably approves of that scene..."
26-05-2019T17:37:48,TeapotOfDoom,Marvel why?
26-05-2019T17:38:00,TeapotOfDoom,Oh boi
26-05-2019T17:38:26,AspiringNoodle,You should see the interviews she did with other Avengers members.
26-05-2019T17:38:33,AspiringNoodle,The tension is palpable.
26-05-2019T17:39:21,TeapotOfDoom,I would do something like a fat burn on that guy. Would be more appropriate
26-05-2019T17:39:34,TeapotOfDoom,And a better role model
26-05-2019T17:40:28,TeapotOfDoom,"And even then, that guy may came across as a douche but i would bet there are women out there taking compliments as insults in any scenario"
26-05-2019T17:40:50,AspiringNoodle,Don't take the redpill xD
26-05-2019T17:40:51,TeapotOfDoom,And we definitely don't need more of those

26-05-2019T20:44:14,Twokinds,Well you just need excuse not to eat.
26-05-2019T20:44:30,Twokinds,For me it was cutting out all carbs. Pretty much didn't allow me to eat pretty much anything.

26-05-2019T20:47:01,Bgrmystr2,which is why most people fail diets cuz they do em wrong.
26-05-2019T20:48:09,AspiringNoodle,I do one thing right though.  I prefer grilled meats over fried (though it is nice on occasion).  And I prefer white meat and seafood over red ^^
26-05-2019T20:49:38,AspiringNoodle,I wonder how much weight I could lose if I eat nothing but Soylent Squared...

26-05-2019T20:50:23,Bgrmystr2,well soylent is literally just the name they marketed as all the nutrients your body needs for survival
26-05-2019T20:51:08,Bgrmystr2,so you'd probably lose weight slowly.
26-05-2019T20:51:16,Bgrmystr2,It's no different from eating a completely balanced diet.
26-05-2019T20:51:36,Bgrmystr2,you need an imbalanced diet that doesn slow carbs

26-05-2019T21:01:31,Bgrmystr2,sugar alone doesn't make you fat.
26-05-2019T21:01:40,Bgrmystr2,there's a whole lot more to it than that.

26-05-2019T21:02:31,Bgrmystr2,"that ignores all the other things that do the same, breads for example lol xD"
26-05-2019T21:03:11,AspiringNoodle,"Doesn't change the fact that we have statistics showing that as sugar consumption has skyrocketed, so have other medical conditions."
26-05-2019T21:03:39,AspiringNoodle,Unless they lied to me and there are other things in our diet that have also gone up

26-05-2019T21:20:49,Bgrmystr2,I don't touch that xD
26-05-2019T21:21:15,AspiringNoodle,"Carbs, Overwatch, or salt?"
26-05-2019T21:21:32,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-wondering:
26-05-2019T21:21:36,Bgrmystr2,yes.
26-05-2019T21:21:40,Bgrmystr2,"Technically no, but yes."
26-05-2019T21:23:29,Bgrmystr2,"it was to overwatch, but I don't really eat much salty foods, and I don't know the carbs in my diet, don't really keep track."
26-05-2019T21:25:41,AspiringNoodle,I gotta stop giving in to takeout night[s]
26-05-2019T21:25:49,AspiringNoodle,All that food gonna sabotage my efforts
26-05-2019T21:28:41,AspiringNoodle,"Well, at least I can enjoy my ramen while watching a video about Japan.  And part of the video takes place in a national chain restaurant known for its ramen"
26-05-2019T21:28:42,SpazztasticKiwi,I doubt any of you follow Thomas on ig but the poor baby royally flubbered his coffee this morning
26-05-2019T21:39:01,SpazztasticKiwi,think carbs don’t count if you eat em fast enough?
26-05-2019T21:39:21,Bgrmystr2,uh :ptv-laugh:
26-05-2019T21:39:41,Bgrmystr2,if that's what you wanna go with
26-05-2019T21:42:21,AspiringNoodle,"From what I've heard, as long as it's not your food, it doesn't count."
26-05-2019T21:43:24,AspiringNoodle,"Man, that ramen was delicious.  But Japan's right about it though.  Ramen is definitely a once in a while food ^^;"
26-05-2019T21:47:50,SpazztasticKiwi,desperate firefly’s back
26-05-2019T21:48:05,AspiringNoodle,"Idk what's sadder.  That by increasing the playback speed of this video to 1.25 I'm chopping off maybe 10 minutes, or that it's more entertaining this way."

26-05-2019T21:48:40,AspiringNoodle,Anyone here watch the promotional videos for WTF 101?
26-05-2019T21:49:36,AspiringNoodle,"If not, they have a video covering reproduction in the animal kingdom, and they cover one of the HORNIEST species on the planet."
26-05-2019T21:49:56,AspiringNoodle,"The males have such a high libido, they will try to do it with anything.  Even the ground."
26-05-2019T21:50:26,AspiringNoodle,"As you can imagine, the scientific community was in disbelief at that discovery ^^;"
