21-02-2019T21:48:50,SageSaga,we did try to argue over who gets to draw AI and who had to take care of Yosh

21-02-2019T21:58:52,CrRAR,buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo?
21-02-2019T21:58:55,Bgrmystr2,Eh. When you had a college level comprehension in elementary
21-02-2019T21:59:00,Bgrmystr2,it's not.
21-02-2019T21:59:11,ShadowSoap,o.O
21-02-2019T21:59:26,MarvTheHugPharaoh,RENI \o/
21-02-2019T21:59:26,ThingsAreMoving,whut's a college level comprehension in elementary
21-02-2019T21:59:38,CrRAR,"oh heyy, indeed"
21-02-2019T21:59:56,PurpleLemons,"so thats where she went off to, huh"
21-02-2019T22:00:01,Bgrmystr2,Comprehension is something you get tested on in school. It's rated by grade levels.
21-02-2019T22:00:11,Bgrmystr2,"There's a lot of different stuff, but that's one of em"
21-02-2019T22:00:21,ZahnHolley,"come to think of it? when look at toms work i feel motivated its just that when i look at colors it feels like its circulating through my body, never realise i felt that before. i tellya drawing keeps me motivated i can feel it."
21-02-2019T22:00:21,SageSaga,it means you were able to understand higher grade concepts earlier is all
21-02-2019T22:00:23,ThingsAreMoving,So... like an intellingence test?
21-02-2019T22:00:40,SageSaga,it doesnt actually mean anything though as comprehension is based on many different factors
21-02-2019T22:00:50,Bgrmystr2,"kinda sorta. They do those tests in elementary, middle, and high school"
21-02-2019T22:00:56,CrRAR,so many LEVELS
21-02-2019T22:00:58,SageSaga,a person can comprehend math very well yet miss basic history
21-02-2019T22:01:00,CrRAR,of comprehension
21-02-2019T22:02:03,ThingsAreMoving,"Yup, Sage. There's lots of different intelligence distributions. Some people can read other's emotions, but suck at basic math."
21-02-2019T22:02:10,Bgrmystr2,Comprehension was basically rating how well you understood the intention of what you've read.
21-02-2019T22:02:24,Nekonny,so whats all new? ^^
21-02-2019T22:02:33,HeresyArtStream,Reni <3
21-02-2019T22:02:35,SageSaga,yeah but simply being interested in what you are reading can improve your comprehension
21-02-2019T22:02:42,ThingsAreMoving,I'd like to take that kind of test. Is there some online testing like this?
21-02-2019T22:02:44,SageSaga,oh hey Ron- you streaming?
21-02-2019T22:02:49,ThingsAreMoving,o/ Ron!~

21-02-2019T22:03:08,Bgrmystr2,"yeah that's also true, sage. Because you put more effort into trying to figure it out. It's active."
21-02-2019T22:03:26,Bgrmystr2,"Not sure, things"
21-02-2019T22:03:48,ThingsAreMoving,Wow! That Reni's dress must've taken a lot of material to make.

21-02-2019T22:20:54,CrRAR,By action of turning one into a Basitin you create a universe crushing paradox

21-02-2019T22:31:19,SageSaga,yes
21-02-2019T22:31:31,w0lfmare,One of the things I like most about taking commissions as a webcomic artist is the people who pay to have me draw my own characters

21-02-2019T22:32:28,Nekonny,I'm wondering about if I should start having these animations on a patreon or something
21-02-2019T22:32:39,CrRAR,that'd be cool
21-02-2019T22:33:28,ThingsAreMoving,I'm wondering if drawing other's artists characters count as sort of a 'cover version'.
21-02-2019T22:33:32,zanAspera,I'm so jealous of Princess Reni's dress.
21-02-2019T22:33:39,Bgrmystr2,"A lot of the time, Music covers are covered by creative freedom"
21-02-2019T22:34:06,Bgrmystr2,it's kinda complicated though
21-02-2019T22:34:24,Bgrmystr2,and technically yeah things
21-02-2019T22:34:25,SageSaga,I am of the opinion that if someone is paying for you to draw another persons characters- you should ask the owner of the characters if its ok first unless they have it stated somewhere they are ok with it
21-02-2019T22:34:44,SageSaga,and even then- i think you should ask
21-02-2019T22:34:46,ThingsAreMoving,Ethical. I concur.
21-02-2019T22:34:51,NezumiYuki,Agreed
21-02-2019T22:35:00,zanAspera,I'd say zat's a must.... yes..

21-02-2019T22:35:19,Bgrmystr2,"I don't know if I agree with that, but I also think it's not something that you should have to ask."
21-02-2019T22:35:46,SageSaga,people have asked me to draw Kate and Blue having sex together
21-02-2019T22:36:08,SageSaga,i refused because i do not do adult art and dont want adult art of my characters made
21-02-2019T22:36:09,ThingsAreMoving,"Seems like Sage follows the most obscure and most important rule of being a human. ""Try not to be a dick to other people"""
21-02-2019T22:36:16,SageSaga,so that person went to someone else and had them draw it
21-02-2019T22:36:35,zanAspera,"If it's not your characters, and you are making money drawing zem..... You are open to copywrite lawsuit."

21-02-2019T22:36:57,Nekonny,I wasn't so sure about other cases
21-02-2019T22:37:08,Nekonny,I guess it doesnt hurt to ask
21-02-2019T22:37:24,ThingsAreMoving,"Smells like an easy lawsuit on your side, Sage."
21-02-2019T22:37:25,zanAspera,You don't have Pardy or academic fair use arguments...

21-02-2019T22:38:02,HeresyArtStream,No-one's gonna get sued because Disney knows about the Streissand effect.
21-02-2019T22:38:04,MrEase,Hello everyone!
21-02-2019T22:38:06,SageSaga,Fanart doesnt fall under parody
21-02-2019T22:38:13,Bgrmystr2,u wot sage
21-02-2019T22:38:24,SageSaga,fanart is by definition illegal- it's just not worth taking people to court over
21-02-2019T22:38:24,HeresyArtStream,The companies don't want to get in front of a jury and show them a bunch of porn of their characters. :V
21-02-2019T22:38:25,MrEase,fanart falls under fair use does it not?
21-02-2019T22:38:32,SageSaga,no
21-02-2019T22:38:35,ThingsAreMoving,"Parody needs to have some humorous elements, no?"
21-02-2019T22:38:35,Bgrmystr2,It's fair use yes it is
21-02-2019T22:38:38,SageSaga,bull crap
21-02-2019T22:38:40,zanAspera,"In a commision you are making money, and no, not all fan art is of a parodic nature."
21-02-2019T22:38:48,HeresyArtStream,"If it's not, the companies have long since given up on enforcing copyright."
21-02-2019T22:38:51,Nekonny,"Ok, heres a case"
21-02-2019T22:38:57,Bgrmystr2,Nope. Not bull. And there's court rulings in favor of fair of it.
21-02-2019T22:39:09,SageSaga,"its not parody, its not for education- now if you only made it for yourself and no one else- then its fair use"
21-02-2019T22:39:29,Nekonny,if I were to say... offer a voting system on patreon where people could sugest and vte for tharacters they wanted animated
21-02-2019T22:39:33,Bgrmystr2,that's not even remotely how fair use is written lol
21-02-2019T22:39:37,Nekonny,and someone picked kate
21-02-2019T22:39:49,HeresyArtStream,Didn't Nintendo try to shut down a Pokemon porn site and got denied?
21-02-2019T22:39:55,Nekonny,thats the sort of thing I was wondering about
21-02-2019T22:40:10,ThingsAreMoving,"It would be up to you to moderate what's in the polls, Ron."
21-02-2019T22:40:12,ThingsAreMoving,imho
21-02-2019T22:40:14,SageSaga,Bgr- seriously- i know what im talking about when it comes to copyright - i went to school for this bull crap
21-02-2019T22:40:17,zanAspera,"You may or may not get sued, but you are open to it... And fair use is a defence you can argue to ze judge, but historically porn does not do well in such circumstances."
21-02-2019T22:41:01,ThingsAreMoving,"I keep wondering, just how many tailors does Reni have?"
21-02-2019T22:41:15,NezumiYuki,ignores the chats for just a second to say to Tom:  Wooooo Reni's gown is becoming more and more details isn't it?  That necklace is a nice touch!
21-02-2019T22:41:16,SageSaga,"parody, educational use, review, and private use"
21-02-2019T22:41:24,MuonNeutrino,does it make a difference if it was done commercially? i.e. just fan art some person drew and put it on the internet vs somethign that they were *commissioned* for?
21-02-2019T22:41:26,zanAspera,"Garbage Pail Kids if anywone remembers zem, were clearly of Pardy intent, but ze judge ruled against zem anyway because personal judgement he didn't feel it wverfy of protecting zem"
21-02-2019T22:41:45,SageSaga,and Parody rarely works in court without being from a known parody source
21-02-2019T22:42:02,HeresyArtStream,"In all practicality I don't think IP holders have any interest in trying to shut down fan art, or they'd be doing it pretty often. I don't think there's been any recent examples of a fan artist being legally threatened though."
21-02-2019T22:42:09,HeresyArtStream,Selling prints might be where it gets a bit iffy
21-02-2019T22:42:17,Nekonny,What about Warhol's Campbell‚Äôs Soup?
21-02-2019T22:42:29,HeresyArtStream,That was actually done with permission from Cambell's Soup.
21-02-2019T22:43:07,HeresyArtStream,"But in any case, Warhol probably would have won a lawsuit if he didn't have it, but having written permission is definitely preferable."
21-02-2019T22:43:10,zanAspera,"Parody is actually very strictly interpreted, it you really are  a parody and you are transformative and you aren't using too mush source material zat isn't too close to ze core of ze original ...  ...  So menny variables"
21-02-2019T22:43:27,CatzArt,Oi!
21-02-2019T22:43:41,NezumiYuki,hiya Catz
21-02-2019T22:43:54,ThingsAreMoving,oi? are you a punk?
21-02-2019T22:44:19,zanAspera,"It is expensive for zem to file suit, but also consider how much more expensive it would be for you to defend such a lawsuit"
21-02-2019T22:44:36,HeresyArtStream,The things I was warned about is copying or tracing photos as part of your artwork unless you have permission from the rights holder.
21-02-2019T22:44:38,CatzArt,No just imagine that I said that with a bad american version of a scottish accent and your good Things
21-02-2019T22:45:06,SageSaga,if theres one thing i got out of my degree it's understanding copyright and trademarking
21-02-2019T22:45:22,ThingsAreMoving,ay
21-02-2019T22:45:29,SageSaga,Fanart is pretty much protected by it just not being profitable to go after your FANS
21-02-2019T22:45:44,zanAspera,"Aye, zot it be"
21-02-2019T22:45:48,HeresyArtStream,Yep
21-02-2019T22:46:00,HeresyArtStream,Attacking your fans is not a profitable venture.
21-02-2019T22:46:14,HeresyArtStream,"Sometimes the corporations have to be reminded of this, but eventually they remember."
21-02-2019T22:46:14,NezumiYuki,In sort... Best not bite the hand that feeds your corporation.  LeL
21-02-2019T22:46:45,CatzArt,Too late I already attacked my ceiling fan.
21-02-2019T22:46:52,ThingsAreMoving,But if fans lewd your characters wneh you explicitly stated you don't want that... isn't that a good reason not to call them your fans and go after them?
21-02-2019T22:47:04,SageSaga,yeah
21-02-2019T22:47:05,zanAspera,"Genderally not, but zere comes a point zat it is...  Star Trek owners have cracked down on fans several times..."
21-02-2019T22:47:10,SageSaga,but even then- its expensive
21-02-2019T22:47:16,Nekonny,anyone can try to go afeter anyone for anything... its'all a matter if it sticks and if they want to bother with it in the first place
21-02-2019T22:47:24,HeresyArtStream,Star Trek isn't doing too good right now. -o-
21-02-2019T22:47:39,Nekonny,I imagine a lot of cases only everr go as far as the cease and desist letter.
21-02-2019T22:47:48,SageSaga,Star Trek is a different matter folks
21-02-2019T22:48:01,HeresyArtStream,"It sounds like Star Trek 14 has been canceled, and Discovery probably isn't getting a third season."
21-02-2019T22:48:02,zanAspera,It's also best not to bite ze corporation zat gives you such vunderful original verks zat you vanna copy
21-02-2019T22:48:05,SageSaga,Star Trek is a collection of TRADEMARKS - those are VERY different
21-02-2019T22:48:06,MuonNeutrino,@SageSaga do you have an easier case if they're doing it for profit i.e. commissions?
21-02-2019T22:48:19,ThingsAreMoving,"Welp, I guess artists need some thick skin."
21-02-2019T22:48:35,SageSaga,yes its easier but its usually more costly than you will get out of it unless you can prove they have made thousands on it
21-02-2019T22:49:03,zanAspera,"Yes, but zey are far from ze only vuns to have...  And it isn't Star Trek, it's ze rights holders... CBS, Paramount, Viacom, etc..."
21-02-2019T22:49:09,SageSaga,Have  you heard anyone say you have to protect your copyright or else you will lose it?
21-02-2019T22:49:24,HeresyArtStream,yep
21-02-2019T22:49:34,SageSaga,That's a false statement people say- its because they mixed up Copyright and Trademarks
21-02-2019T22:49:41,HeresyArtStream,"Although, there are good and bad ways to approach it."
21-02-2019T22:49:45,SageSaga,if you dont protect your TRADEMARK you can lose it
21-02-2019T22:49:52,ThingsAreMoving,"Aaaaaand it's 4am. Thanks for the discussion, the art, entertainment and enlightenment. o/ Tom, Sage, Ron!"
21-02-2019T22:49:59,CrRAR,bye things
21-02-2019T22:50:07,NezumiYuki,Nite nite Things
21-02-2019T22:50:15,Bgrmystr2,Seeya things
21-02-2019T22:50:24,SageSaga,so if people make Star Trek into a common thing anyone can use- it can no longer be trademarked and becomes public
21-02-2019T22:50:24,zanAspera,"Yes, Trademarks you must protect, but Copywrite is never abandoned, can always be enforced retroactively"
21-02-2019T22:50:31,HeresyArtStream,"Like, Lucasfilm was historically very supportive of fan film projects. Crowd funding fan ventures has not worked out well though."
21-02-2019T22:50:36,SageSaga,like Bandaids!
21-02-2019T22:50:49,zanAspera,yinghugs zings
21-02-2019T22:51:09,SageSaga,"Bandaid is not the name of the product- its a trademark they keep almost losing because people call all ""adhesive bandages"" bandaids"
21-02-2019T22:51:24,HeresyArtStream,"With crowd funding I guess it's fair enough to say that it's difficult to tell where it stops being a non-profit venture, which is why most IP holders will categorically say ""no"" to any fan projects that use Kickstarter or Indiegogo."
21-02-2019T22:51:39,MviluUatusun,Like calling all corn chips Fritos.
21-02-2019T22:51:45,NezumiYuki,"Seriously Tom, you and Val should sell Keidran Collars, and Zhose Rock Zhings!"
21-02-2019T22:52:11,HeresyArtStream,"Although, in some instances it's a really, really bad look to shut down fan projects, even if they're within their rights to do so."
21-02-2019T22:52:11,zanAspera,Zat zings... Matriarch Sesra has zat zings to sell.
21-02-2019T22:52:24,NezumiYuki,"Oh yes Zan, indeed she does"
21-02-2019T22:52:29,HeresyArtStream,"Like, Lucasfilm and EA shutting down that Knights of the Old Republic remake."
21-02-2019T22:52:42,zanAspera,It's not like TV copanies are not good at making really bad decisions!
21-02-2019T22:52:45,AskNeonFlash,Hello
21-02-2019T22:52:49,CrRAR,hi
21-02-2019T22:52:51,HeresyArtStream,"They have been burning bridges with the fans enough as it is, and that was probably not a smart choice."
21-02-2019T22:52:53,zanAspera,*cough*  Fox and Firefly*
21-02-2019T22:53:26,SageSaga,the safest way to allow fan made content is to make it part of your work- like Mods in games
21-02-2019T22:53:26,zanAspera,But it is zeir choice to make...
21-02-2019T22:53:36,zanAspera,Zey are fully in zeir rights to do so
21-02-2019T22:53:38,HeresyArtStream,They could have offered to work with the developer and distribute it as an official product.
21-02-2019T22:53:42,Clippy,Fox had the opportunity to own Star Wars when the first movie was looking for a production company
21-02-2019T22:53:46,SageSaga,by making mods with their tools you agree to certain conditions
21-02-2019T22:53:51,HeresyArtStream,yep
21-02-2019T22:54:01,Clippy,back in the 70s
21-02-2019T22:54:24,HeresyArtStream,"For as much shit as Bethesda gets over Fallout 76, historically they have been very willing to work with community creators."
21-02-2019T22:54:26,Clippy,(also really enjoying the date concept here)
21-02-2019T22:54:39,HeresyArtStream,"Maybe a little too much at times, like outsourcing patches to the community. x3"
21-02-2019T22:55:03,SageSaga,yeah XD
21-02-2019T22:55:08,zanAspera,I reallllly like Reni.
21-02-2019T22:55:14,NezumiYuki,Somebody refresh my memory?  What was the name of that Fan-Project which Paramount killed off because they didn't come up with the idea first?
21-02-2019T22:55:18,MviluUatusun,"Well, I'm falling asleep here so, I'm going to head off to bed.  I'll see y'all later."
21-02-2019T22:55:27,HeresyArtStream,"Even though what Nintendo did to AM2R and Pokemon Uranium was kind of shitty, at least you can easily find and download those."
21-02-2019T22:55:32,NezumiYuki,Ah Nite nite Mvil
21-02-2019T22:55:34,zanAspera,"Nezumi,,, All of zem?"
21-02-2019T22:55:43,HeresyArtStream,We'll never get to play that KOTOR remake because EA and Disney killed it in the womb.
21-02-2019T22:55:50,zanAspera,yinghugs mvilu
21-02-2019T22:56:13,SageSaga,online video reviewers are still being hit by copyright claim after copyright claim
21-02-2019T22:56:21,MrEase,"Hell the AM2R one, kinda made sense because they were already working on the remake"
21-02-2019T22:56:27,SageSaga,even though review is legit part of copyright fair use
21-02-2019T22:56:33,HeresyArtStream,"EA's only released two very mediocre Star Wars games since Disney bougth the IP, and with that in mind, shutting down a promising fan project is a really, really bad look."
21-02-2019T22:56:54,HeresyArtStream,"""We know you don't like our products, so we have to protect them by shutting down this free alternative that looks a lot better."""
21-02-2019T22:56:58,CrRAR,"Ooo, horn adornments~"
21-02-2019T22:57:24,zanAspera,It's zeir right...  If zey don't like munnies. :p
21-02-2019T22:57:30,HeresyArtStream,Yep :P
21-02-2019T22:57:35,zanAspera,Horniments!
21-02-2019T22:57:39,HeresyArtStream,Star Wars isn't doing too good in terms of money though.
21-02-2019T22:57:40,CrRAR,accouterments of the swanky variety
21-02-2019T22:57:50,NezumiYuki,"LOL so Tom, are those like... Horn Stockings for Reni... and that butterfly horn band is more like a Garter?  :D  I like it!"
21-02-2019T22:57:54,zanAspera,Ze monarch is so perfect for her
21-02-2019T22:57:57,HeresyArtStream,Disney still hasn't recouped their original investment and the money it's bringing in has slowed down by a significant margin.
21-02-2019T22:58:06,CrRAR,lil horn doilie FTW
21-02-2019T22:58:11,SageSaga,i dont know what is going on with video game companies lately- its like they forgot how to make games
21-02-2019T22:58:21,HeresyArtStream,It sounds like Disney is more interested in making Star Wars TV shows than more movies and games right now.
21-02-2019T22:58:51,NezumiYuki,Would it be Tacky for Reni to wear back seamed horn stockings?
21-02-2019T22:58:55,CrRAR,forget pipi longstockings... it's Reni hornstocking naow.
21-02-2019T22:59:05,HeresyArtStream,"Yeah, the AAA gaming industry is heading for disaster if they don't get their shit together."
21-02-2019T22:59:28,HeresyArtStream,"And as they say, a high tide raises all ships, so I don't think anyone should be eagerly anticipating that."
21-02-2019T22:59:37,zanAspera,"Well, right now AAA games are so expensive to produce zat people making zem are very over cautious, so zey don't dare take a risk on enyzing outside ze box..."
21-02-2019T22:59:50,SageSaga,i saved so much money on games lately because they have been so bad- that i was able to afford a commission
21-02-2019T23:00:00,HeresyArtStream,The cost of making AAA games keeps getting higher and the quality keeps getting lower.
21-02-2019T23:00:01,CrRAR,haha too true
21-02-2019T23:00:08,HeresyArtStream,The budgets are mostly going into the graphics and marketing.
21-02-2019T23:00:17,zanAspera,"And Indy games are too ... Indy, for big publishers to invest any money in..."
21-02-2019T23:00:40,CrRAR,can't force creativity.... the big companies will NEVER learn that.
21-02-2019T23:00:48,zanAspera,"As a techie, let me tell you programmers are not cheep eizzer!"
21-02-2019T23:00:59,NezumiYuki,The age of the AAA publishers might be neigh...  Take a look at Subnautica as a prime example of Indie gone and done GOOD and the public loves the product!
21-02-2019T23:01:05,CrRAR,They just belt out cookie cutter mass-appeal titles and hope for a BIG SCORE!
21-02-2019T23:01:27,HeresyArtStream,"Part of why I think the 6th generation of game consoles was one of the best is because the idea of a AAA game didn't really exist yet. There were a lot of ""AA"" games."
21-02-2019T23:01:49,HeresyArtStream,"Like, stuff like GTA and Halo would probably fit the ""AAA"" bill back then"
21-02-2019T23:01:55,zanAspera,"Oh, no, zat is ze zing, zey are forcing ze opposite of creativity... zey are restricting and prohibitiing creativity, 'cuz zey don't understand it and are afraid of it"
21-02-2019T23:02:12,CrRAR,"yeah, they DILUTE it"
21-02-2019T23:02:18,CrRAR,adulterate it
21-02-2019T23:02:21,HeresyArtStream,Most games in the early 2000s were medium budget and only had to sell a few 100k copies to be profitable.
21-02-2019T23:02:30,HeresyArtStream,"Well, for big games I mean."
21-02-2019T23:02:59,SageSaga,any of you see Alita Battle Angel?
21-02-2019T23:03:06,HeresyArtStream,I will be seeing it!
21-02-2019T23:03:15,CrRAR,yeah nowadays if BIG GAME 3 has bad sales they nix the whole deve team for not aking it MORE generic than it's already become xD
21-02-2019T23:03:23,NezumiYuki,What's up with those Anime-ish freakishly large eyes?  O.o
21-02-2019T23:03:26,CrRAR,*making

21-02-2019T23:03:49,HeresyArtStream,"Anyway, it's gotten so ridiculous that a game has to sell 10 million copies and have microtransactions and in-game real money gambling out the ass just to break even."
21-02-2019T23:03:51,AskNeonFlash,Hi neko
21-02-2019T23:03:56,AskNeonFlash,Hello

21-02-2019T23:04:14,NezumiYuki,"Silly is good, Zan"
21-02-2019T23:04:21,Apostrophe,We have an independent theater here that sort of operates like one
21-02-2019T23:04:24,SageSaga,Movie was good though
21-02-2019T23:04:44,HeresyArtStream,"I think if I was going to go to an alamo drafthouse, the one movie on the horizon I'd be willing to sit in the car for that long for would be Godzilla: King of Monsters."
21-02-2019T23:04:47,SageSaga,not like the greatest thing ever but it was an actually GOOD hollywood movie based on a Manga/anime!!!
21-02-2019T23:04:53,SageSaga,thats like- unheard of
