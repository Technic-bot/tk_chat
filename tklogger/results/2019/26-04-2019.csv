26-04-2019T11:05:52,MuonNeutrino,... my brain is now picturing a scene from when keith goes back to the fox lands to return laura's ashes
26-04-2019T11:06:02,MuonNeutrino,he is of course accompanied by natani
26-04-2019T11:07:08,MuonNeutrino,"who, thanks to the totally-not-canon contacts he's had with laura's ghost in various patreon posts, is fully aware of what those two did to laura (and by extension keith)"
26-04-2019T11:09:13,MuonNeutrino,"and so somewhere along the way, natani gets fed up with the totally-insincere expressions of grief/sympathy from laura's sisters and pulls them aside for a little bit of ... wolven persuasion"
26-04-2019T11:09:15,anonlooker,Now we need a sketch of Laura's sisters and the two mean Tigresses meeting up.
26-04-2019T11:09:47,MuonNeutrino,"(i.e. 'i know what you did to keith. if you ever even *think* about doing anything like that again, I will feed you your own tails. now fuck off' >.>)"
26-04-2019T11:09:49,TerraTheWizard,mean girls vs mean girls
26-04-2019T11:10:26,MuonNeutrino,i find the mental image of natani terrifying the crap out of laura's sisters highly amusing ^^
26-04-2019T11:10:57,anonlooker,It will be the greatest conflict or greatest coalition on the face of Mekkan.
26-04-2019T11:30:56,CrimsonQuill,I'm waiting for the next comic page.

26-04-2019T11:34:47,MuonNeutrino,i've been wondering about this for two years
26-04-2019T11:34:58,MuonNeutrino,so i'm very interested to see how it goes
26-04-2019T11:35:22,CrimsonQuill,I just look forward to seeing how Rose'll help Raine with her probem.

26-04-2019T14:04:38,CrimsonQuill,Tom
26-04-2019T14:04:44,CrimsonQuill,I have a question to ask
26-04-2019T14:04:47,CrimsonQuill,About the comic
26-04-2019T14:04:50,CrimsonQuill,In general
26-04-2019T14:05:28,tehbear,go on
26-04-2019T14:06:05,CrimsonQuill,I'm waiting for Tom to respond
26-04-2019T14:07:24,sunblaze,good evening everyone
26-04-2019T14:08:04,CrimsonQuill,hullo
26-04-2019T14:08:08,SageSaga,yo Sunblaze
26-04-2019T14:09:50,Twokinds,I'm waiting for question
26-04-2019T14:10:30,CrimsonQuill,"Right, sorry"
26-04-2019T14:10:33,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-sleepy: The waiting that never ends. Good morning
26-04-2019T14:10:55,CrimsonQuill,"So, why is Raine the only one who, as a Keidran, has pads on her hands?"
26-04-2019T14:11:00,iliar,Waiting for question??? Sounds like challenge.
26-04-2019T14:11:08,Twokinds,Because she does.
26-04-2019T14:11:15,CrimsonQuill,I'll take that.
26-04-2019T14:11:22,CrimsonQuill,:ptv-scratch:
26-04-2019T14:11:23,MuonNeutrino,didn't you say once that it was to make her look more distinctive?
26-04-2019T14:11:30,Bgrmystr2,"lol, it's to make her more unique, yeah"
26-04-2019T14:11:35,Bgrmystr2,we knew that
26-04-2019T14:11:36,Twokinds,It's part of her character design.
26-04-2019T14:12:28,Twokinds,"They all technically do, because obviously if their palms were covered in fur it'd be awful hard to grip things, but she's the only main character I actually draw it for, to make her Keidran form stand out even more from her human form."
26-04-2019T14:12:45,MuonNeutrino,LORE! \o/
26-04-2019T14:12:51,CrimsonQuill,I see.
26-04-2019T14:13:01,Bgrmystr2,"lol Muon, we knew that already too though"
26-04-2019T14:13:02,Bgrmystr2,XD
26-04-2019T14:13:11,CrimsonQuill,"I was just wondering about it, now I know."
26-04-2019T14:13:12,MuonNeutrino,yeah i know i'm just being silly ^^
26-04-2019T14:16:19,Dakina,Ello.
26-04-2019T14:16:37,MuonNeutrino,yo
26-04-2019T14:18:46,SageSaga,yo
26-04-2019T14:19:21,anonlooker,Well I did not know. I learned something today.
26-04-2019T14:19:29,Dakina,What's up?
26-04-2019T14:19:32,SageSaga,XD
26-04-2019T14:19:46,SageSaga,wrong color

26-04-2019T14:29:29,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: cheater
26-04-2019T14:29:39,Bgrmystr2,what mistake?
26-04-2019T14:33:39,SageSaga,the classic wrong arm
26-04-2019T14:34:14,SageSaga,brb need watah

26-04-2019T14:35:29,Bgrmystr2,"well, you either fixed it or I'm not seeing it"
26-04-2019T14:35:33,Bgrmystr2,cuz they all look correct
26-04-2019T14:36:08,tehbear,"it was a left arm, now its a right arm"
26-04-2019T14:36:15,tehbear,2nd panel
26-04-2019T14:36:30,Bgrmystr2,ahh the gauntlet lookin thing?

26-04-2019T14:36:42,Bgrmystr2,you could see the thumb?
26-04-2019T14:37:08,SageSaga,you- werent looking at all XD
26-04-2019T14:37:32,tehbear,maybe it was harmless
26-04-2019T14:37:33,Bgrmystr2,"I was not, I'm a bit preoccupied with a few things sorry lol"
26-04-2019T14:37:56,Bgrmystr2,I didn't notice you doing anything when you were wondering if you could fix it
26-04-2019T14:38:19,Bgrmystr2,oh that dude's hand? xD
26-04-2019T14:38:38,SageSaga,i flipped his arm
26-04-2019T14:38:42,tehbear,"oh, right. the character has a gauntlet on right hand, but not left."
26-04-2019T14:39:05,Bgrmystr2,"welp, his arm looks correct now"
26-04-2019T14:39:08,Bgrmystr2,so that's good
26-04-2019T14:39:39,SageSaga,he's wearing the gauntlet from the previous chapter- Kaylin gave it to him
26-04-2019T14:54:54,RimaDraws,i am home from watching endgame.

26-04-2019T15:50:07,LannAF,I'm interested in it and ttrying to see if anyone else would nab it in the future
26-04-2019T15:50:57,SageSaga,just looked it up - not familiar with it
26-04-2019T15:51:12,SageSaga,is made by russians
26-04-2019T15:51:30,SageSaga,should have guessed- what with the name and all
26-04-2019T15:52:10,LannAF,hahaha
26-04-2019T15:52:19,LannAF,it's apparently an FPS/RPG with MMO features.
26-04-2019T15:52:22,LannAF,PvE and PvP

26-04-2019T16:25:24,Bgrmystr2,Missin a questionmark in one of the lower panels on Raine's last speech bubble.
26-04-2019T16:25:28,MuonNeutrino,that is why i am idling here
26-04-2019T16:25:32,Bgrmystr2,"it's been around for months, Lann xD"

26-04-2019T16:26:26,Bgrmystr2,gotta lurk more :P

26-04-2019T16:27:32,iliar,Tom saved my money. I thought about Nora Card human Roselyn from https://www.patreon.com/posts/misc-sketches-1-22773443
26-04-2019T16:27:59,MuonNeutrino,heh
26-04-2019T16:28:26,MuonNeutrino,"he first showed that snippet of sketch in the stream for comic 960 back when rose was first introduced, i've been waiting for this to happen ever since"
26-04-2019T16:28:33,MuonNeutrino,*reintroduced
26-04-2019T16:29:39,Bgrmystr2,Boooooop :ptv-excited:
26-04-2019T16:30:30,anonlooker,"Did anyone thought of the word ""NERD!"" when Raine was talking about magic to Rose?"
26-04-2019T16:30:59,MuonNeutrino,"i suppose i should have, but no"
26-04-2019T16:31:21,MuonNeutrino,probably because that's how my brain already works so it seems normal to me XD
26-04-2019T16:31:51,Bgrmystr2,"I didn't, cuz that's usually spoken by assholes, Anon lol"
26-04-2019T16:32:28,LannAF,or by friends dicking around with each other
26-04-2019T16:32:37,LannAF,*stares at sage*
26-04-2019T16:32:56,anonlooker,I just think of Dragon Ball Z Abridged when I say it. It is only out of jest rather than malice.
26-04-2019T16:33:06,MuonNeutrino,it *is* somewhat of a meme
26-04-2019T16:33:25,Ordithus,:csagesaga-c3: hello!
26-04-2019T16:33:29,Bgrmystr2,maybe. I can't see it any way other than derogatory so I don't really participate with it.

26-04-2019T17:01:06,Ordithus,"""Hey, can I order some sliced bread?"""

26-04-2019T18:47:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Guys I’m mad
26-04-2019T18:50:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I had my theories on Endgame but I just saw spoiler tho it looked a lil fake out of focus
26-04-2019T18:50:21,Bgrmystr2,I don't wanna know :u
26-04-2019T18:50:53,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-flomad: nu spoilerz
26-04-2019T18:50:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Like I said I want to say it was fake or a shot out of context
26-04-2019T18:51:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Though spoilers don’t bother me too much. I’m almost caught up to be ready to see it Tuesday by the way!
26-04-2019T18:52:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Gonna pop in Ragnorok when I get home
26-04-2019T18:52:34,Ordithus,Nice!  I still have a few movies to watch in the series
26-04-2019T18:52:38,Ordithus,Way out of order though
26-04-2019T18:53:29,Ordithus,"Captain America 2, Thor 2, Avengers 2... I'm noticing a pattern"
26-04-2019T19:03:35,SpazztasticKiwi,You don’t care about the sequels
26-04-2019T19:04:04,SpazztasticKiwi,When’s everyone seeing endgame
26-04-2019T19:05:12,RimaDraws,i already saw it today
26-04-2019T19:05:15,Ordithus,But I have seen the third of all of those (counting Civil War as Captain America)
26-04-2019T19:16:37,Ordithus,Tweet tweet mofo https://imgur.com/a/FFsRoVF
26-04-2019T19:18:15,Orthonox,I'm probably going to see it in 2 or so weeks when it will probably not be packed.
26-04-2019T19:23:57,Bgrmystr2,I don't expect to see it for probably months till itcomes out on netflix or something.. and then one of my friends decides to randomly come by.. and the movie happens to randomly pop up in conversation.
26-04-2019T19:24:08,Bgrmystr2,so basically.. unless all the stars align.
26-04-2019T19:24:13,Bgrmystr2,I likely won't see it
26-04-2019T19:29:12,Ordithus,"I don't have any plans yet, though I will try to see it while it's still in theaters"
26-04-2019T19:32:05,RimaDraws,i finally did some more fanart. just a simple headshot of raine

26-04-2019T19:50:20,Bgrmystr2,nice :ok_hand:
26-04-2019T19:51:16,Ordithus,That imgur link I posted a bit ago is of some robins hanging out in a tree in my front yard
26-04-2019T19:51:35,RimaDraws,thanks ^^
26-04-2019T19:51:38,RimaDraws,aw robins
26-04-2019T19:51:43,RimaDraws,little fat birds
26-04-2019T19:59:37,Ordithus,Anyways... I did not expect Rose would share the family gift
26-04-2019T20:00:00,RimaDraws,well i had a hunch
26-04-2019T20:00:09,RimaDraws,for quite a while now
26-04-2019T20:00:22,Ordithus,What gave you the hunch?
26-04-2019T20:00:31,RimaDraws,well
26-04-2019T20:01:03,Bgrmystr2,"I'm curious if she really does share it, or if it's just a magical transformation, just visual"
26-04-2019T20:01:10,Bgrmystr2,"like natani does, but obviously way better"
26-04-2019T20:01:23,Ordithus,Or what Nora did to Mike
26-04-2019T20:01:47,Bgrmystr2,"yeah all of those are entirely visual, but feel real"
26-04-2019T20:02:03,RimaDraws,honestly cant remember but i figured after she was lifted of her restrictions somehow she would actually have that in her lineage because euchre has been able to do it successfully. i mean why not roselyn? i have a couple theories on her.
26-04-2019T20:02:32,Ordithus,Like that moment revealed that she's really quite powerful?
26-04-2019T20:02:35,RimaDraws,both of them can do it without mana crystals and it runs in the family
26-04-2019T20:02:54,RimaDraws,oh yea that and possibly earlier when raine was tellin the story of her father and cousin rose
26-04-2019T20:02:55,Bgrmystr2,"well, tom always said that Euchre was unique in his ability.. that it's not necessarily magic, but an ability"
26-04-2019T20:03:10,Bgrmystr2,the fact that Raine inhereted it means he could have done so as well..
26-04-2019T20:03:11,Ordithus,Unless he turns Basitin
26-04-2019T20:03:13,Ordithus,STUCK
26-04-2019T20:03:16,Bgrmystr2,..yeah stuck XD
26-04-2019T20:03:23,Bgrmystr2,but he can't tho
26-04-2019T20:03:25,RimaDraws,my theory is that euchre and roselyn able to do magic without mana crystals are descendants of the original hybrids.
26-04-2019T20:03:36,Ordithus,hmm
26-04-2019T20:03:50,RimaDraws,it is just a theory now
26-04-2019T20:04:28,Ordithus,I haven't thought about that possiblity... they have been alluded to before.
26-04-2019T20:04:46,RimaDraws,not officially a thing but its what i feel and so does my bf. i also believe that roselyn had studied magic when trace lost saria and tried to help him but he saw her as a threat and maybe thats why she had those restrictions put on her
26-04-2019T20:04:50,Bgrmystr2,"well, that's kind of debunked already though, cuz tom said it was not possible for humans and keidran to have kids together prior to Neutral lifting the limitation."
26-04-2019T20:05:25,Ordithus,iirc Neutral stated it had been a long time... to the archives!
26-04-2019T20:05:28,RimaDraws,like i said theories before he brought it up
26-04-2019T20:05:42,RimaDraws,but this was a for fun thing i had thought of for a fan story.
26-04-2019T20:07:13,RimaDraws,i have my own theories and thats that .
26-04-2019T20:07:50,RimaDraws,and it is just for fun.
26-04-2019T20:08:02,Ordithus,"""But there is another race... one that I have not allowed for many, many years"" http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/206/"
26-04-2019T20:08:29,Bgrmystr2,"Yeah, I'm also questioning Whether a hybrid of human and keidran would even have a power to transform fully from one to the other."
26-04-2019T20:08:54,Bgrmystr2,being a hybrid doesn't automatically mean unique abilities
26-04-2019T20:09:10,RimaDraws,idk....
26-04-2019T20:09:12,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, it's possible"
26-04-2019T20:09:19,RimaDraws,i was just putting my thoughts out there
26-04-2019T20:09:26,Ordithus,"Yeah, just saying there is SOME evidence in the support column"
26-04-2019T20:09:28,Bgrmystr2,but I don't think being decendants from hybrids would be the cause of the abilities
26-04-2019T20:09:37,Bgrmystr2,but both are possible honestly
26-04-2019T20:09:43,RimaDraws,i never said that
26-04-2019T20:09:47,Bgrmystr2,it would have to be over many many years
26-04-2019T20:09:48,RimaDraws,i said possible descendants
26-04-2019T20:09:54,RimaDraws,not that their abilities came from that
26-04-2019T20:10:00,RimaDraws,good lord...
26-04-2019T20:11:01,Ordithus,"True or not, Raine and Rose are both cute, wolf or human"
26-04-2019T20:11:04,Ordithus,How do they do it
26-04-2019T20:11:07,RimaDraws,idk...
26-04-2019T20:11:10,Bgrmystr2,"magic, obviously xD"
26-04-2019T20:11:27,RimaDraws,idk. beauty isnt magic
26-04-2019T20:11:44,Bgrmystr2,any sufficiently advanced technology etc etc
26-04-2019T20:11:56,RimaDraws,if it was then i would be prettier by now
26-04-2019T20:12:04,Ordithus,"That really doesn't work for this, bgr"
26-04-2019T20:12:18,Bgrmystr2,sure it does.
26-04-2019T20:12:39,Ordithus,Any sufficiently advanced beauty is indistinguishable from magic?
26-04-2019T20:13:00,Bgrmystr2,it all stems from tom's stylus to the tablet.
26-04-2019T20:13:11,Bgrmystr2,it cannot be comprehended.
26-04-2019T20:13:13,Ordithus,Well now you're just being real
26-04-2019T20:13:14,Bgrmystr2,Beauty is magic.
26-04-2019T20:13:17,Bgrmystr2,LV
26-04-2019T20:13:25,Ordithus,"""because he draws them pretty, duh"""
26-04-2019T20:13:25,RimaDraws,i wish i had magic maybe i could be a better artist and beautiful
26-04-2019T20:13:27,Bgrmystr2,:V * but level is okay too.
26-04-2019T20:15:47,RimaDraws,but then again magic would be more fun
26-04-2019T20:17:01,Ordithus,"To magic!  The cause of, and solution to, all of life's problems!"
26-04-2019T20:17:08,RimaDraws,i wish

26-04-2019T20:46:09,Ordithus,How many cars did you look at?
26-04-2019T20:51:48,CrRAR,"okay maybe not a ton, like 7, though at different dealerships though/"
26-04-2019T20:52:30,CrRAR,"Thought I had a good one two weeks ago, was out on a test drive came back and the salesdude/management sold it out from under me before I got back."

26-04-2019T20:54:02,Bgrmystr2,I don't see how they can sell it while you're test driving it?
26-04-2019T20:54:37,Ordithus,"Multiple people looking at one car, can't decide right away, call back when someone else is checking it out"
26-04-2019T20:55:10,Bgrmystr2,"yeah but test driving a car that you're looking at and someone else buys it while you're gone, what purpose do you have to drive it out to begin with"
26-04-2019T20:55:11,CrRAR,"I know! I asked them when I came back, like is there a deposit and why no ""Sold/Hold"" sign the told me the deciding story."
26-04-2019T20:55:31,Bgrmystr2,yeah exactly. that's their responsibility to do that shit
26-04-2019T20:55:51,CrRAR,"The also told me it was to ""a friend"", so they were giving more leniency to them. bah"
26-04-2019T20:56:00,Ordithus,"I'm sure the dealer hates it, too.  Wastes your time and theirs"
26-04-2019T20:56:01,Bgrmystr2,playing favorites is illegal.
26-04-2019T20:56:12,Bgrmystr2,that's discriminitory
26-04-2019T20:56:25,CrRAR,I know I know was pissed.
26-04-2019T20:56:40,CrRAR,My brother was with me to and both our hearts dropped.

26-04-2019T20:57:09,Bgrmystr2,did that car you got come from them or some other place?
26-04-2019T20:57:17,Bgrmystr2,cuz they don't deserve your money bro
26-04-2019T20:57:22,Bgrmystr2,or anyones
26-04-2019T20:57:25,CrRAR,Oh OTHER place for sure xD

26-04-2019T20:57:27,Bgrmystr2,good
26-04-2019T20:58:02,CrRAR,I got to finding some all-wheel drive models
26-04-2019T20:58:47,Bgrmystr2,"I have my eye on a few cars from back in the 1970s and such, love the design of em. Actually look good compared to the rounded bubbly garbage of today"
26-04-2019T20:58:57,CrRAR,Oh totally
26-04-2019T20:58:58,Bgrmystr2,but.. basically none of the nice stuff like carfax existed back then
26-04-2019T20:59:13,Bgrmystr2,so it's prettymuch impossibru to know for SURE what happen with them..
26-04-2019T20:59:24,Ordithus,Just got to take a very close look
26-04-2019T20:59:36,CrRAR,"Yeah, I like the new challengers, classic 70s style, expensive though and mostly only RWD."
26-04-2019T20:59:39,Ordithus,And work with people who are trustworthy
26-04-2019T20:59:49,Ordithus,And expect surprises
26-04-2019T21:00:16,Ordithus,Winter tires!
26-04-2019T21:00:20,CrRAR,"Oh yeah you just have to evaluate, evaluate, evaluate, don't listen to the dealer... listen to the car."
26-04-2019T21:00:26,CrRAR,Oh yeah lol Ord
26-04-2019T21:00:45,Bgrmystr2,"unfortunately for me, I don't know shit about cars like I know computers."
26-04-2019T21:00:50,CrRAR,I really don't think RWD is SO bad in winter... just different.
26-04-2019T21:00:52,Ordithus,"I drive a lil front drive car year round, it handles 6+ inches of snow just fine"

26-04-2019T21:01:17,CrRAR,Yeah
26-04-2019T21:01:20,Bgrmystr2,I've had what.. more than 20 years of my life to adapt to computers bruh. I don't have another 20 for cars XD

26-04-2019T21:03:02,Ordithus,That car was a full 1000 lb heavier than my Focus
26-04-2019T21:03:21,CrRAR,"I was always surprised... my old car was a Civic.... light cars like to ""float"" on snow."
26-04-2019T21:03:21,Ordithus,Yet was smaller inside...
26-04-2019T21:03:27,CrRAR,haha
26-04-2019T21:03:34,CrRAR,More room for ENGINE

26-04-2019T21:06:38,CrRAR,one of the most important things I learned is that dealerships go in cycles.... they're either hardline or play it more fast and loose.
