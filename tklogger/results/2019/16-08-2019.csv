16-08-2019T01:29:57,SageSaga,i dont even see an undo in the gesture options
16-08-2019T01:30:26,SageSaga,which makes me worried its grabbing info from like Windows default gestures even though thats turned of on the wacom properties
16-08-2019T01:33:02,SageSaga,"there's an option that says ""Use Wacom Gestures"" or ""Use Windows Gestures"" - but you have to pick one or the other!"

16-08-2019T01:54:35,unsteddyphoenix,....how
16-08-2019T01:55:11,CrimsonHelsing,"Keiren, I swear... He's starting to become the more immediate threat, trying to play hero"
16-08-2019T01:55:12,FenceEqualizer,By believing.
16-08-2019T01:55:45,FenceEqualizer,"If you put your mind to it you can do anything, right?"
16-08-2019T01:56:12,BadFoMo,He's just concered for an old friend.
16-08-2019T01:56:18,CrimsonHelsing,If he does anything to interfere with those two... ooh I swear...
16-08-2019T01:56:43,Dadrobit,"Ah yes, I see you ascribe to the, ""if at first you don't succeed, give up immediately"" ideology, helsing."
16-08-2019T01:57:22,Ordithus,I'd be hesitant to trust my childhood friend to a murderous megalomaniac
16-08-2019T01:57:26,Dadrobit,Because goodness forbid he try to do what he believes is right for the people he cares about and is supposed to protect
16-08-2019T01:57:27,unsteddyphoenix,i guess you can if you put your mind to putting your mind to it
16-08-2019T01:57:34,CrimsonHelsing,I'm sorry what?
16-08-2019T01:58:03,CrimsonHelsing,"I know he's trying to protect Flora but Jesus Christ, he's distrusting one wrong man too many"
16-08-2019T01:58:29,ZRO4825,You're only paranoid if they're not out to get you o_o
16-08-2019T01:58:42,CrimsonHelsing,At least he's no friend of the Templar
16-08-2019T01:58:46,Sclimshady,Good point ZRO
16-08-2019T01:58:55,BadFoMo,"I think, as far as he knows, Trace is still Old Trace."
16-08-2019T01:58:57,Masterzooka,how the hell do you draw the grass so realistically
16-08-2019T01:59:16,CrimsonHelsing,"If he does, Badfo, then he's a damn idiot"
16-08-2019T01:59:17,Dadrobit,"I mean, he's distrustful of literally Hitler. Can't really blame him for not believing ""I don't remember killing all those innocents""."
16-08-2019T01:59:38,CrimsonHelsing,It's painfully obvious he's not the same guy
16-08-2019T01:59:49,ZRO4825,"Also, gotta keep in mind, Keiran has NO clue what's actually going on. All he knows is Templar were being friendly, then ""Templar"" attacked, and in the midst of it, suddenly the missing Grand Templar shows up...but he's not acting like the Grand Templar."
16-08-2019T02:00:18,Sclimshady,From Kei's veiw he hasn't seen the story and only remembers a manipulative murderer
16-08-2019T02:00:18,ZRO4825,"So, at this point, he doesn't know who is actually telling the truth, who's lying, and who's acting to gain an advantage."
16-08-2019T02:00:23,Dadrobit,Stop one fireball and suddenly you're absolved of killing untold thousands of people.
16-08-2019T02:00:35,Ordithus,He's doing his job by asking questions
16-08-2019T02:00:36,FenceEqualizer,Thousands of wife murderers you mean
16-08-2019T02:00:37,BadFoMo,Was Keiren ever informed about Trace more or less becoming a new person?
16-08-2019T02:00:42,Dadrobit,Lol
16-08-2019T02:01:07,ZRO4825,"To my recollection, Fomo, no."
16-08-2019T02:01:17,ArchimediesMD,i'd be distrustful if the guy that was leading the people that hated keidrans sudden;y was friends with one...or something along those lines
16-08-2019T02:01:28,CrimsonHelsing,Hugh... right... yeah can't really blame him.
16-08-2019T02:01:43,Dadrobit,Keiren at least knows he's still dangerous. Remember that Flora was begging Trace not to hurt him.
16-08-2019T02:01:50,Sclimshady,Something along those lines :ctwokinds-NoraEyebrows:
16-08-2019T02:02:01,FenceEqualizer,To be fair Kei was attacking Trace first.
16-08-2019T02:02:05,Sclimshady,:ctwokinds-traceflohug:
16-08-2019T02:02:06,CrimsonHelsing,But I'm gonna be so mad if he ends up ducking everyone over and inadvertently helping the enemy in the process.
16-08-2019T02:02:08,FenceEqualizer,Which....is kinda ballsy when you think about it
16-08-2019T02:02:17,FenceEqualizer,The hell is wrong with Kei!?
16-08-2019T02:02:26,CrimsonHelsing,*dicking everyone over
16-08-2019T02:02:27,Ordithus,He's captain of the guard!
16-08-2019T02:02:33,Dadrobit,"Detaining him, not attacking."
16-08-2019T02:02:54,Masterzooka,karen’s tongue looks like a loveheart. coincidence? i think not.
16-08-2019T02:02:56,unsteddyphoenix,his ego > his sense of self presevation
16-08-2019T02:02:59,Dadrobit,And it was to make sure that Flora could get safely away from him.
16-08-2019T02:03:09,ZRO4825,"Also, at first he thought Trace was a slaver, and had no clue he was the former Grand Templar."
16-08-2019T02:03:46,Sclimshady,Or his care for the community and the Keidrens is greater Teddy
16-08-2019T02:04:09,FenceEqualizer,Feel like it was more then detaining.
16-08-2019T02:04:11,Masterzooka,shouldn’t it be “strangers already try to pet me”?
16-08-2019T02:04:27,FenceEqualizer,Also you guys realize it was two years sense that event happen? Feel old yet?
16-08-2019T02:04:37,Dadrobit,"Yeah, he's been Johnny On The Spot about trying to protect his people. Just unfortunately plot keeps getting in the way."
16-08-2019T02:04:40,FenceEqualizer,*since
16-08-2019T02:05:00,unsteddyphoenix,if that were the case he woulda waited and formed a plan or whatever
16-08-2019T02:05:12,Sclimshady,Why you gotta bring that up fence?
16-08-2019T02:05:25,unsteddyphoenix,but he assaulted trace cause he was with his waifu
16-08-2019T02:05:30,Dadrobit,Keiren is a man of Action!
16-08-2019T02:05:31,Masterzooka,i was 27 days old when this comic started. jesus...
16-08-2019T02:05:32,Sclimshady,No one said he was the brightest
16-08-2019T02:05:47,Sclimshady,He did grow up in a backwater town
16-08-2019T02:06:04,Dadrobit,"Pfft, you'd do the same if you saw Kat with me unsteddy, be honest now. :D"
16-08-2019T02:06:11,Sclimshady,XD
16-08-2019T02:06:12,Ordithus,":ctwokinds-keifacepalm:*[I've only been captain for a week, come on]"
16-08-2019T02:06:13,unsteddyphoenix,he tried to alpha male trace
16-08-2019T02:06:24,FenceEqualizer,Just saying. He only had two guards to hold trace back. Not sure why he thought that would be enough
16-08-2019T02:06:38,FenceEqualizer,Feel like Trace of old would have went dynasty warriors on them.
16-08-2019T02:06:39,Ordithus,He didn't know Trace was Trace at the time
16-08-2019T02:06:39,BadFoMo,How about this for old? Remember AOL?
16-08-2019T02:06:40,Dadrobit,Probably would be enough for the average man
16-08-2019T02:06:51,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-flomad: you get away dad!!!
16-08-2019T02:07:05,Masterzooka,ｄａｄｄｙ
16-08-2019T02:07:26,Dadrobit,Afraid she'd call me dad too unsteddy?
16-08-2019T02:07:27,FenceEqualizer,Trace just has to hit them with the square square square triangle.
16-08-2019T02:07:42,CrimsonHelsing,"All I can hope and pray for is that Reni, in her youthful naivety, does not become the unlikable, sniveling weasel of this part of the story."

16-08-2019T02:54:34,Dadrobit,"Have a good one l, sage!"
16-08-2019T02:55:29,SpazztasticKiwi,I found a picture today that made me think of Holly
16-08-2019T02:56:05,Sclimshady,Ominous message Kiwi
16-08-2019T02:56:20,Sclimshady,Why are we fearing shadows?
16-08-2019T02:56:36,SpazztasticKiwi,don’t worry about it
16-08-2019T02:56:37,sunblaze,bye
16-08-2019T02:56:47,SpazztasticKiwi,just don’t let em eat you
16-08-2019T02:58:59,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve sent for picarto to see about the issue but till then things will be spotty
16-08-2019T02:59:21,MarvTheHugPharaoh,picarto is not the best for getting back to people
16-08-2019T02:59:35,SpazztasticKiwi,that means more time to waste time elsewhere
16-08-2019T02:59:42,Sclimshady,"I'm gonna head to bed, night everyone o/"
16-08-2019T02:59:50,MarvTheHugPharaoh,nighty night shady
16-08-2019T03:00:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve been considering downloading minecraft just to mess around like Seán’s been
16-08-2019T03:00:32,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Minecraft is a lot of fun
16-08-2019T03:00:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,if you do prepare to have hours fly by
16-08-2019T03:01:14,SpazztasticKiwi,a whole day of “what does this do” and immediately dying
16-08-2019T03:02:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"lol, pretty much"
16-08-2019T03:02:43,SpazztasticKiwi,I mean I’ve been watching Seán so I have some sort of guide
16-08-2019T03:03:03,SpazztasticKiwi,the colorblind leading the blind but it’s better than nothing
16-08-2019T03:04:15,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I had to learn from watching Team Epiphany back in MC's bata days so you're better off
16-08-2019T03:04:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Seán knew not to dig straight down cause that’s one of the first things he’d heard of
16-08-2019T03:05:06,SpazztasticKiwi,and what’s he eventually try?
16-08-2019T03:05:33,SpazztasticKiwi,curiosity killed the Irishman
16-08-2019T03:06:09,MarvTheHugPharaoh,curiosity killed many in that game
16-08-2019T03:07:58,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m waiting for him to try taking a sea turtle home
16-08-2019T03:08:09,SpazztasticKiwi,he’s tried herding all the other animals
16-08-2019T03:08:32,Dadrobit,"Holy crap, this dude is incredible. He's got sidechicks for his sidechicks. I didn't think guys like him actually existed. It's like chatting with a unicorn."
16-08-2019T03:08:47,Dadrobit,A horny unicorn.
16-08-2019T03:08:53,SpazztasticKiwi,I wouldn’t call that incredible
16-08-2019T03:09:23,Dadrobit,Fascinating is probably the word.
16-08-2019T03:09:57,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Does he look like Robbie Rotten, Dad?"
16-08-2019T03:10:07,Dadrobit,He finally headed out to go back to patrolling.
16-08-2019T03:10:23,Dadrobit,Not really.
16-08-2019T03:10:33,MarvTheHugPharaoh,damn ;-;
16-08-2019T03:10:39,Dadrobit,"Kinda the same hairstyle, but shorter and brown."
16-08-2019T03:10:56,SpazztasticKiwi,like a Petri dish waiting for a sample
16-08-2019T03:11:39,Dadrobit,"I take that back, he's kinda like a short Robbie Rotten, but with brown hair and a more angular chin."
16-08-2019T03:11:58,SpazztasticKiwi,if these ladies don’t know who they’re dealing with it’s gonna be a tragedy eventually
16-08-2019T03:12:03,MarvTheHugPharaoh,<3
16-08-2019T03:12:42,Dadrobit,Most of them are out of state. He's got some of them sending him money for him to save up to eventually move out to them.
16-08-2019T03:12:48,SpazztasticKiwi,I hope he carries condoms everywhere
16-08-2019T03:13:06,SpazztasticKiwi,and that’s just deplorable
16-08-2019T03:13:12,Dadrobit,The dude is actually low key evil.
16-08-2019T03:14:12,SpazztasticKiwi,he’s gonna catch something - either a fight or virus or something
16-08-2019T03:14:31,SpazztasticKiwi,do what you want but be careful people
16-08-2019T03:16:32,Dadrobit,"On a lighter note, this turkey and provalone sandwich is delicious."
16-08-2019T03:16:37,SpazztasticKiwi,oh no - if there’s some out of state how’s he sure they’re legal
16-08-2019T03:17:00,SpazztasticKiwi,yeah just ew
16-08-2019T03:17:05,SpazztasticKiwi,nm
16-08-2019T03:17:11,Dadrobit,And Bang's Pina Colada energy drink is actually super tasty.
16-08-2019T03:17:16,SpazztasticKiwi,I had pizza earlier
16-08-2019T03:17:34,MarvTheHugPharaoh,dad have you try'ed the black cherry and vanilla bang?
16-08-2019T03:17:37,SpazztasticKiwi,so is it pina colada or energy drink
16-08-2019T03:17:44,Dadrobit,"Zero chemical taste, it straight up Pina colada."
16-08-2019T03:17:46,MarvTheHugPharaoh,energy dronk
16-08-2019T03:18:00,SpazztasticKiwi,so what makes it an energy drink
16-08-2019T03:18:10,Dadrobit,"Nah, haven't done the black cherry, not a fan of black cherry."
16-08-2019T03:18:28,SpazztasticKiwi,black cherry is a good or bad
16-08-2019T03:18:29,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Big sad, It takes like the cherry icee form 7/11"
16-08-2019T03:18:44,SpazztasticKiwi,depends how the maker does it
16-08-2019T03:18:54,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Kiwi, Bang is just a solar flair in a can.  No idea how it works"
16-08-2019T03:18:54,Dadrobit,Had the cotton candy one. That one was way too fucking chemically sweet and I ended up throwing it up.
16-08-2019T03:19:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,eek
16-08-2019T03:19:33,Dadrobit,"Yeah, only energy drink I've ever had that did that."
16-08-2019T03:19:42,SpazztasticKiwi,they blend in fairy dust  - that’s gonna be it
16-08-2019T03:20:01,SpazztasticKiwi,only thing I’ve tried is a monster
16-08-2019T03:20:05,SpazztasticKiwi,they nasty
16-08-2019T03:20:11,Dadrobit,This one is actually amazing though. Might be a new favorite. Still love Monster Zero though.
16-08-2019T03:20:18,SpazztasticKiwi,energy drinks be nasty
16-08-2019T03:20:51,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"I used to drink Venom energy but only because they sponsored some of out airsoft games, they did not last long as a company"
16-08-2019T03:20:52,SpazztasticKiwi,and really anyone under 40 don’t need energy drinks
16-08-2019T03:20:57,Dadrobit,"A lot of energy drinks are nasty, most of Monster is. But the white cans, the Zero one, that tastes good. Like Sprite."
16-08-2019T03:21:05,SpazztasticKiwi,they should sell that to the retirement homes
16-08-2019T03:21:11,SpazztasticKiwi,pick up bingo Saturday
16-08-2019T03:21:45,Dadrobit,"Bing, but they use a cattle auctioneer as the caller."
16-08-2019T03:21:51,Dadrobit,Bingo*
16-08-2019T03:22:05,SpazztasticKiwi,bingo but in fast forward
16-08-2019T03:23:21,Dadrobit,"Oh, and since streams are dead, here https://imgur.com/a/WrKh3rO"

16-08-2019T03:23:38,SpazztasticKiwi,my grandma took me to her bingo once
16-08-2019T03:23:53,SpazztasticKiwi,they call as fast as they can to challenge themselves
16-08-2019T03:24:06,MarvTheHugPharaoh,He's so cute!
16-08-2019T03:24:18,SpazztasticKiwi,https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/524825976597643265/612191839658967061/image0.jpg this made me think of Holly
16-08-2019T03:24:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom likes to say she’s always fat
16-08-2019T03:24:53,Dadrobit,Oreo is best fine boi
16-08-2019T03:25:01,SpazztasticKiwi,dog looks like he’s shocked you took his picture
16-08-2019T03:25:09,SpazztasticKiwi,“I wasn’t ready”
16-08-2019T03:25:12,MarvTheHugPharaoh,My cat used to be at 40% but after the cone of shame he's a fine boy
16-08-2019T03:25:20,Dadrobit,Lol
16-08-2019T03:25:34,SpazztasticKiwi,“Oh lawd he’s comin”
16-08-2019T03:25:48,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"More like ""Oh lawd he bitchin:"
16-08-2019T03:26:06,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Every word out of him is a complaint
16-08-2019T03:26:12,Dadrobit,A hungry cat is a loud cat
16-08-2019T03:26:19,MarvTheHugPharaoh,^
16-08-2019T03:26:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Kiwi lost some weight
16-08-2019T03:27:01,SpazztasticKiwi,she’s a little less round and a bit more ovalish
16-08-2019T03:27:01,Dadrobit,Same for Oreo tbh. I have learned that he has to have company to eat his food. He refused to eat unless I'm with him. He gets too lonely otherwise
16-08-2019T03:27:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,";-;, Thats so sad but so cute"
16-08-2019T03:27:29,Dadrobit,Follows me around and whines unless I go sit with him while he eats.
16-08-2019T03:27:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera likes to eat whenever I go into the room
16-08-2019T03:28:03,SpazztasticKiwi,I suspect it’s so I may give him a treat
16-08-2019T03:28:25,SpazztasticKiwi,“see I ate my food so give me the good stuff”
16-08-2019T03:30:06,SpazztasticKiwi,if I eat a half a pound cake over three days will I still gain half a pound
16-08-2019T03:30:49,Dadrobit,My history with dieting would lead me to believe that you would gain at least 3
16-08-2019T03:30:53,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"cake giveth, and keeps giving"
16-08-2019T03:33:53,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nighty night ya'll <3
16-08-2019T03:37:04,Dadrobit,"Have a good night, Marv!"

16-08-2019T08:58:56,Dadrobit,"Oh man, got home and it was tragic."
16-08-2019T08:59:34,Dadrobit,I played with the puppy for a few minutes to get him to calm down and then started looking for the inevitable puppy piddles.
16-08-2019T09:00:00,Dadrobit,"I get to the end of my search and lo and behold, he managed to keep everything clean while I was at work."
16-08-2019T09:00:19,Dadrobit,I turn around ready to give him a buncha praise and a hug....
16-08-2019T09:00:41,Dadrobit,"And boom, he pops a squat and pees right in front of me..."
16-08-2019T09:00:44,Dadrobit,So close....
16-08-2019T09:01:04,TerraTheWizard,haha oh dear
16-08-2019T09:09:36,IronHorseComics,poor thing

16-08-2019T14:30:42,SpazztasticKiwi,my power went out at 4 last night
16-08-2019T14:30:56,AnuSekaniArt,XD
16-08-2019T14:30:56,SageSaga,who assigns a keybind to something 95% of people dont have access to?
16-08-2019T14:30:58,Kullax,F24? what kind of keyboard you got Sage?
16-08-2019T14:31:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"even at 7-8 am, it is hot here"
16-08-2019T14:32:02,SageSaga,i have a G910 - it has macro keys that i can assign to anything- so i used F24 for my push to talk because nothing should use it XD
16-08-2019T14:32:04,SpazztasticKiwi,and my fan was out until sometime around 8
16-08-2019T14:32:15,LannAF,...
16-08-2019T14:32:16,LannAF,f24
16-08-2019T14:32:18,LannAF,the heck
16-08-2019T14:32:21,LannAF,Mine is Y
16-08-2019T14:32:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Y talk
16-08-2019T14:32:41,AnuSekaniArt,XD
16-08-2019T14:33:09,ZRO4825,Forward side button on the mouse for me~
16-08-2019T14:33:20,ZRO4825,Cuz the back button is always melee in FPS :3
16-08-2019T14:33:25,ZRO4825,"Well, it is for me."
16-08-2019T14:33:35,AnuSekaniArt,When I get my computer up and running I'll find a good button lol
16-08-2019T14:33:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I have no idea what my laptop key is
16-08-2019T14:34:28,SageSaga,thats my keyboard - colors and all
16-08-2019T14:34:33,SpazztasticKiwi,my phones got a “push to talk” though I’ve never used it
16-08-2019T14:34:40,Kullax,I've used Mouse Button 3 for PTT for a few years now. It's hard to change that habbit.
16-08-2019T14:34:42,ZRO4825,"I wouldn't be able to reach that button mid-game, lol"
16-08-2019T14:35:09,SageSaga,is right there- and its hard to miss
16-08-2019T14:35:40,SpazztasticKiwi,“how did you miss he was three feet in front of you”
16-08-2019T14:35:41,SageSaga,its also great while working
16-08-2019T14:35:43,ZRO4825,"Small hands. I wouldn't be able to reach that while WSAD'ing around in a game, lol"
16-08-2019T14:36:07,SpazztasticKiwi,special hands
16-08-2019T14:36:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"use your feet, duh"
16-08-2019T14:36:44,ZRO4825,What kinda monkey you think I am? :P
16-08-2019T14:37:03,SpazztasticKiwi,do you really want me to answer that question
16-08-2019T14:37:12,SageSaga,just adapt
16-08-2019T14:37:24,SpazztasticKiwi,evolve
16-08-2019T14:37:34,SpazztasticKiwi,become the monkey person
16-08-2019T14:37:52,ZRO4825,Would rather become a cat person~
16-08-2019T14:38:03,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m already there
16-08-2019T14:38:22,SpazztasticKiwi,already have two - not much longer before I become cat lady
16-08-2019T14:38:28,SageSaga,wait- anyone remember how many times immortal son wu kong was?
16-08-2019T14:38:52,ZRO4825,"Never heard about him being immortal, but I also haven't looked into his mythos much."
16-08-2019T14:39:37,SageSaga,he did at least 3 different things that granted immortality - but immortality in Chinese stuff is weird because immortals can die-
16-08-2019T14:39:59,SageSaga,under specific circumstances- so the more times you were immortal it was like extra lives
16-08-2019T14:40:08,SpazztasticKiwi,“ok so you’re unkillable but don’t be stupid with it”?
16-08-2019T14:40:29,SageSaga,like i think one was if you sacrificed yourself
16-08-2019T14:41:02,SageSaga,"then there were immortal killing weapons - but they usually could only kill a ""once immortal"" so twice immortals were immune to them"
16-08-2019T14:42:00,SageSaga,i think Son Wu Kong was 3 or 5 times immortal
16-08-2019T14:42:22,SpazztasticKiwi,terms and conditions immortality and reincarnation
16-08-2019T14:42:35,SpazztasticKiwi,where’s the rulebook
16-08-2019T14:43:27,AnuSekaniArt,Chinese mythology is outside my wheelhouse. More familiar with Egyptian and Japanese lol
16-08-2019T14:43:32,SageSaga,it's like ancient Chinese fiction was Fanfic land
16-08-2019T14:43:55,SageSaga,"""Oh yeah? Well my character is 5 times immortal so your Sun killer sword cant hurt him!"""
16-08-2019T14:44:20,AnuSekaniArt,XD
16-08-2019T14:44:56,SageSaga,"""Well my Hero will just reforge the Sun Sword in the light of the moon to boost its power to kill Immortal x5!"""
16-08-2019T14:45:52,SageSaga,"""Uhm - actually the moon is just reflecting sunlight-"" ""Shut up science man!"""
16-08-2019T14:46:17,SageSaga,"""Fine! I'll just go make gunpowder then!"""
16-08-2019T14:46:37,ZRO4825,lol
16-08-2019T14:47:18,SageSaga,this has been a reenactment of ancient China?
16-08-2019T14:47:22,SpazztasticKiwi,so basically it’s a wobbly D&D game
16-08-2019T14:47:55,ZRO4825,Hmmm...I need to go get some lunch.
16-08-2019T14:48:05,ZRO4825,That means I gotta get dressed though. -.-
16-08-2019T14:48:10,RimaDraws,same
16-08-2019T14:48:11,SpazztasticKiwi,and picarto is still 💥
16-08-2019T14:48:12,RimaDraws,lol
16-08-2019T14:48:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I still got pizza
16-08-2019T14:48:34,ZRO4825,Subway or Hardee's? :thinking:
16-08-2019T14:48:44,AnuSekaniArt,I warmed up some leftover pizza myself X3
16-08-2019T14:48:45,RimaDraws,hardee's
16-08-2019T14:48:53,SpazztasticKiwi,hardees still exists?
16-08-2019T14:48:56,RimaDraws,zro you wanna help me decide?
16-08-2019T14:48:56,AnuSekaniArt,"Hardee's for taste, Subway for marginally more health XD"
16-08-2019T14:48:58,IronHorseComics,of course
16-08-2019T14:49:03,ZRO4825,"Uh, yes, very much so, Kiwi o_o;"
16-08-2019T14:49:08,SpazztasticKiwi,flip a coin
16-08-2019T14:49:11,RimaDraws,i am debating on chik fil a or pizza
16-08-2019T14:49:16,ZRO4825,We've got at least 3 within 10-15 mins for my area alone~
16-08-2019T14:49:18,SpazztasticKiwi,pizza
16-08-2019T14:49:20,ZRO4825,Chik-fil-a
16-08-2019T14:49:20,IronHorseComics,"chick fil a, it's good for your soul"
16-08-2019T14:49:29,ZRO4825,"To hell with your soul, just eat more chikin. ^_^"
16-08-2019T14:49:35,RimaDraws,i am getting chik fil a today. i love their food
16-08-2019T14:49:37,SageSaga,Hardees is one of the best fast food chains
16-08-2019T14:49:43,ZRO4825,Yus!
16-08-2019T14:49:49,RimaDraws,if i get a pizza ill eat on that a week and i dont need it
16-08-2019T14:49:56,AnuSekaniArt,BRB
16-08-2019T14:50:05,ZRO4825,Plus the crew at our local Hardee's is super friendly with me cuz I'm there WAY more often than I should be. :joy:
16-08-2019T14:50:08,SpazztasticKiwi,hardees is egh
16-08-2019T14:50:19,RimaDraws,i love hardees
16-08-2019T14:50:27,SpazztasticKiwi,chic fil a is just ew
16-08-2019T14:50:29,ZRO4825,"Better than Wendy's now days. Now Wendy's is kinda meh quality and just as expensive as Hardee's, like, yeesh."
16-08-2019T14:50:32,SageSaga,Chick-fil-a is good bro
16-08-2019T14:50:32,IronHorseComics,hadees has the best burgers and biscuits
16-08-2019T14:50:36,RimaDraws,you are ew'
16-08-2019T14:50:41,ZRO4825,lol
16-08-2019T14:50:55,SpazztasticKiwi,their business practices are ew
16-08-2019T14:51:00,SpazztasticKiwi,though the one time I tried it
16-08-2019T14:51:09,SpazztasticKiwi,I didn’t like the batter
16-08-2019T14:51:19,SageSaga,their owner is a dick
16-08-2019T14:51:27,RimaDraws,eh
16-08-2019T14:51:29,ZRO4825,^ doesn't change that the food is good stuff though.
16-08-2019T14:51:29,SpazztasticKiwi,"it’s like, too peppery or something"
16-08-2019T14:51:32,RimaDraws,to each their own
16-08-2019T14:51:35,SageSaga,but their store practices are actually pretty good
16-08-2019T14:52:07,RimaDraws,they do have good customer service there
16-08-2019T14:52:08,ZRO4825,"It's like, I hate what Epic's trying to do to the game industry, but I love their graphics engine and how it's opened up gaming in general."
16-08-2019T14:52:15,SageSaga,they have a pretty good program where they help their workers pay for college
16-08-2019T14:52:23,SpazztasticKiwi,still not a fan - and I’m not about to sit in a line like that for how expensive it is
16-08-2019T14:52:27,RimaDraws,really sage
16-08-2019T14:52:28,ZRO4825,"Same deal with Chik-fil-A, don't like what their owner is about, but the stores themselves are awesome."
16-08-2019T14:52:47,SpazztasticKiwi,to go to a store is to support the owner
16-08-2019T14:53:00,SpazztasticKiwi,and I know someone who worked at one
16-08-2019T14:53:03,RimaDraws,you dont have to like the owner to eat there
16-08-2019T14:53:05,SageSaga,do you watch anime?
16-08-2019T14:53:11,SpazztasticKiwi,they’re not always nice to employees
16-08-2019T14:53:13,SageSaga,Kiwi
16-08-2019T14:53:32,SpazztasticKiwi,whati
16-08-2019T14:53:40,SageSaga,do you watch anime?
16-08-2019T14:53:42,ZRO4825,Not being nice to employees is sadly something that can vary greatly on a store-to-store basis because that's all in the crew. =(
16-08-2019T14:53:48,SpazztasticKiwi,what kind of anime
16-08-2019T14:53:52,RimaDraws,ours has a nice crew
16-08-2019T14:54:03,SageSaga,have you seen Rurouni Kenshin?
16-08-2019T14:54:08,SpazztasticKiwi,nope
16-08-2019T14:54:11,ZRO4825,shame
16-08-2019T14:54:17,ZRO4825,Good stuff is Kenshin
16-08-2019T14:54:21,RimaDraws,it is
16-08-2019T14:54:24,RimaDraws,on netflix
16-08-2019T14:54:26,ZRO4825,The Samurai X OVAs are frickin awesome.
16-08-2019T14:54:40,SageSaga,yeah- it's just too bad the creator is a Pedo
16-08-2019T14:54:46,SpazztasticKiwi,I have watched a good amount but it’s sorta kinda a tiny bit all in the same circle
16-08-2019T14:55:23,ZRO4825,"if you have to qualify it as ""sorta kinda a tiny bit"" that sounds like you're having to use a REALLY large brush to cover enough area to hit that tiny speck. :P"
16-08-2019T14:55:36,SpazztasticKiwi,most have some sort of Chinese or Japanese myth in the story - either as part of the characters or just told as fun stuff
16-08-2019T14:56:19,SpazztasticKiwi,like Fruits Basket has the zodiac myth - the characters are reincarnations of the animals
16-08-2019T14:56:42,SpazztasticKiwi,other than that it’s demons and “he’s evil but he’s hot” things
16-08-2019T14:56:44,ZRO4825,"Aight, hunger calls, gonna go bug the Hardee's crew again. Back shortly."
16-08-2019T14:56:53,RimaDraws,point being you dont have to like something or someone to like a show or food place
16-08-2019T14:56:56,RimaDraws,thats the point
16-08-2019T14:57:33,SageSaga,nah my point is- you shouldnt punish yourself and the workers because their boss sucks
16-08-2019T14:57:40,SpazztasticKiwi,we don’t even have a cf
16-08-2019T14:57:53,SpazztasticKiwi,closest one is an nourishme
16-08-2019T14:58:13,SpazztasticKiwi,hourish away
16-08-2019T14:58:27,RimaDraws,hm
16-08-2019T14:58:42,AnuSekaniArt,Back
16-08-2019T14:58:42,SpazztasticKiwi,and again - just do not like their practices
16-08-2019T14:58:47,SpazztasticKiwi,those lines tho
16-08-2019T14:58:57,AnuSekaniArt,Yeeee excellent work so far Sage!
16-08-2019T14:59:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Im not even a big fan of going to sonic unless it’s a drink or slushie
16-08-2019T14:59:54,SpazztasticKiwi,or smoothie or shake
16-08-2019T15:00:00,SageSaga,because of their stance on drug use?
16-08-2019T15:00:05,SpazztasticKiwi,their food doesn’t thrill me much
16-08-2019T15:00:18,SpazztasticKiwi,and I’ve gotten sort of sick before
16-08-2019T15:00:50,SpazztasticKiwi,I know one time I had a whopper and it really did make me sick
16-08-2019T15:01:00,SpazztasticKiwi,for like two days
16-08-2019T15:02:39,SpazztasticKiwi,and of course I wanna watch what I’m eating because calories
16-08-2019T15:02:55,SageSaga,my most disliked fast food place is... probably Mc Donalds
16-08-2019T15:03:15,SpazztasticKiwi,I like to grab a drink there
16-08-2019T15:03:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"but as someone who worked at one, good call"
16-08-2019T15:03:40,SageSaga,I only drink water so i dont have a particular place to get drinks XD
16-08-2019T15:03:47,AnuSekaniArt,McD's has a habit of making me feel rough after I eat it
16-08-2019T15:04:02,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s called grease
16-08-2019T15:04:08,AnuSekaniArt,Yeah lol
16-08-2019T15:04:15,ZRO4825,I haven't eaten at McD's in like....9 or 10 years now I think.
16-08-2019T15:04:39,ZRO4825,"I'd rather just spend the money elsewhere and get better food, lol"
16-08-2019T15:04:42,SpazztasticKiwi,if you’re one to get a drink at mcdonalds
16-08-2019T15:04:46,SpazztasticKiwi,don’t get ice
16-08-2019T15:04:49,SpazztasticKiwi,just dont
16-08-2019T15:04:50,SageSaga,Wendys and Hardees/Carl's Jr are 2 of my favorites- i also like Rallys/Checkers
16-08-2019T15:05:21,SageSaga,though havent been to one of those in years
16-08-2019T15:05:27,ZRO4825,"I like Wendy's still, it's just...every time I go there I come away kinda going ""Holy fuck that was HOW MUCH?"""
16-08-2019T15:05:38,SpazztasticKiwi,oh you know my mcdonalds got a new ice cream machine
16-08-2019T15:05:40,ZRO4825,omg Rally's was the bomb <3
16-08-2019T15:05:47,SageSaga,my wendys isnt expensive at all o_o
16-08-2019T15:05:58,SageSaga,is it broken Kiwi? XD
16-08-2019T15:06:00,ZRO4825,I think it's because I always get the Spicy Chicken.
16-08-2019T15:06:13,ZRO4825,I love the hell out of a Wendy's Spicy Chicken. <3
16-08-2019T15:06:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"now instead of it breaking, they’re running out of ice cream"
16-08-2019T15:06:23,AnuSekaniArt,Carl's Jr is great Sage XD
16-08-2019T15:07:02,SpazztasticKiwi,as in the trucks apparently can’t ship enough ice cream that they can end up selling
16-08-2019T15:07:10,ZRO4825,lawlz
16-08-2019T15:07:22,SpazztasticKiwi,which is odd since a cone is $1.19
16-08-2019T15:07:25,SageSaga,i remember like years ago i went to order a hot fudge sunday from a mc donalds- they told me it was broken as i watched an employee fix himself a cone
16-08-2019T15:07:35,ZRO4825,"Damnit, Sage...now I'm itching to go to Wendy's instead of Hardee's. :joy:"
16-08-2019T15:08:00,AnuSekaniArt,XD
16-08-2019T15:08:09,SpazztasticKiwi,yeah they do that when the ice cream stops freezing correctly
16-08-2019T15:08:13,AnuSekaniArt,There's a Wendy's literally within walking distance of my apartment
16-08-2019T15:08:26,SageSaga,hardees chicken biscuits are bomb
16-08-2019T15:08:27,AnuSekaniArt,"Walk there, get Wendy's, walk back. Get good food and burn some calories :P"
16-08-2019T15:08:53,SpazztasticKiwi,employees can’t sell it if it’s not the right frozenness
16-08-2019T15:08:59,SageSaga,how bout Dairy Queen?
16-08-2019T15:09:09,IronHorseComics,I get them occasionally
16-08-2019T15:09:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I can’t even remember the last time I saw a DQ
16-08-2019T15:09:26,IronHorseComics,it's more location that's the problem
16-08-2019T15:09:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I doubt we have one in 2 hours here
16-08-2019T15:10:08,SpazztasticKiwi,they just built that sonic a year or something ago
16-08-2019T15:10:13,SageSaga,Dipped cones are awesome
16-08-2019T15:10:29,SpazztasticKiwi,and hamiton only just now got a Jacks
16-08-2019T15:10:49,SageSaga,"""Here is your delicious ice cream - preserved in a shell of chocolate"""
16-08-2019T15:10:54,SpazztasticKiwi,though they have a burger king and we dont
16-08-2019T15:11:14,SageSaga,burger king is trash now T_T what happened?
16-08-2019T15:11:18,SpazztasticKiwi,only dipped cones I may have had were when mcdonalds had them
16-08-2019T15:11:36,SpazztasticKiwi,like I said a whopper made me sick once
16-08-2019T15:11:38,SpazztasticKiwi,once
16-08-2019T15:12:00,SageSaga,whoppers used to be great- but now its all trash at Burger King
16-08-2019T15:12:15,SpazztasticKiwi,the mighty must fall for a new generation
16-08-2019T15:12:18,AnuSekaniArt,You gotta find the right one I think
16-08-2019T15:12:29,SageSaga,well i only have one
16-08-2019T15:12:31,SageSaga,XD
16-08-2019T15:12:34,SpazztasticKiwi,hamilton has a good taco bell
16-08-2019T15:12:48,SageSaga,Taco Bell is actually really good
16-08-2019T15:12:55,SpazztasticKiwi,they keep the inside colder than the south pole
16-08-2019T15:13:07,SageSaga,XD it was rated as one of the healthiest fast food chains XD
16-08-2019T15:13:18,AnuSekaniArt,Taco Bell's a weird thing for me
16-08-2019T15:13:20,SpazztasticKiwi,we went by once and the drive thu guy had a freezer jacket on
16-08-2019T15:13:30,AnuSekaniArt,I like it but only every now and then
16-08-2019T15:13:41,SpazztasticKiwi,I like the freezies
16-08-2019T15:14:24,SpazztasticKiwi,not good for your weight but I don’t think of them often enough to have them to where they have an impact
16-08-2019T15:14:29,SageSaga,i heard that some fast food places that get a lot of traffic turn the AC reallly low so the people in the kitchen are comfortable- and it pushes people to not stay long
16-08-2019T15:14:42,SpazztasticKiwi,that’s the logic yea
16-08-2019T15:15:05,SpazztasticKiwi,but if you’re a drive thu person you’re not moving around for body heat
16-08-2019T15:15:19,SpazztasticKiwi,so you become a person sickle
16-08-2019T15:15:32,Mippy,Hello
16-08-2019T15:15:41,FreedomCrusader,Hello
16-08-2019T15:15:42,Mippy,Break time
16-08-2019T15:15:59,SpazztasticKiwi,what’s your favorite Sage
16-08-2019T15:16:17,IronHorseComics,I always wondered why it feels so cold in resturants
16-08-2019T15:16:27,AnuSekaniArt,Heeey Mippy ^^
16-08-2019T15:16:56,SageSaga,favorite what?
16-08-2019T15:16:58,SpazztasticKiwi,“we want your money but not your company”
16-08-2019T15:17:01,SpazztasticKiwi,food
16-08-2019T15:17:11,SageSaga,thats a tough one- but probably- Ribs
16-08-2019T15:17:44,SpazztasticKiwi,isn’t there a place that sells ribs
16-08-2019T15:17:55,SageSaga,there are many
16-08-2019T15:18:03,SpazztasticKiwi,mcdonalds had the mcribs but
16-08-2019T15:18:09,SageSaga,thats not ribs
16-08-2019T15:18:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m not sure that was real meat
16-08-2019T15:18:38,SageSaga,you need to go to a BBQ or Smokehouse for real ribs
16-08-2019T15:18:49,SpazztasticKiwi,"when I worked at mine, I worked with someone who was there and knew about when they sold the ribs"
16-08-2019T15:18:51,FoxxTrotter,Yeah...like Texas Roadhouse.
16-08-2019T15:18:58,SageSaga,some other restaurants serve em but smoked ribs are the best
16-08-2019T15:19:05,FoxxTrotter,(Though most go just for the rolls. :0P)
16-08-2019T15:19:11,SageSaga,Texas Roadhouse has alright ribs
16-08-2019T15:19:26,SpazztasticKiwi,never been
16-08-2019T15:19:41,IronHorseComics,they're okay
16-08-2019T15:19:44,IronHorseComics,good steaks
16-08-2019T15:19:57,SageSaga,usually local places in the south and lower east coast have great BBQ/Smokehouse places
16-08-2019T15:19:58,FoxxTrotter,Good steaks...The Peddler.
16-08-2019T15:20:20,SageSaga,we have a place called the County Grill
16-08-2019T15:20:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I was looking at ac’s location and it was either there or my search of New Orleans that I saw a Texas Roadhouse
16-08-2019T15:20:24,Mippy,I usually don’t order ribs out...I’m more than a little messy
16-08-2019T15:20:58,RimaDraws,god that shower felt good
16-08-2019T15:21:08,SpazztasticKiwi,we have a local steak and anything else you can think of restaurant called Yampertown
16-08-2019T15:21:50,SpazztasticKiwi,something you may not see around here is shrimp and stuff
16-08-2019T15:21:58,SpazztasticKiwi,that’s further down
16-08-2019T15:22:11,SageSaga,im on the coast so we have tons of fish places
16-08-2019T15:22:15,SageSaga,fish and crabs
16-08-2019T15:22:24,AnuSekaniArt,Same Sage
16-08-2019T15:22:24,Mippy,I miss those almost anything places. You don’t get those out west
16-08-2019T15:22:24,RimaDraws,yum
16-08-2019T15:22:42,SpazztasticKiwi,last time I went to captain d’s I had crab
16-08-2019T15:22:47,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t like crab
16-08-2019T15:22:49,FoxxTrotter,"There are a few seafood places around here, but most are on the coast."
16-08-2019T15:23:16,Mippy,I miss the coast.
16-08-2019T15:23:35,SpazztasticKiwi,my grandpa lives on the coast
16-08-2019T15:23:46,SpazztasticKiwi,he says he’d leave if he could
16-08-2019T15:23:50,SageSaga,"""Come on down to Dirty Dicks and get crabs!"""
16-08-2019T15:23:53,FoxxTrotter,"Captain D's, Red Lobster and Long John Silvers are chain places, but there are also a couple Mayflower restaurants in the area."
16-08-2019T15:24:04,Mippy,It was such a chill lifestyle.
16-08-2019T15:24:06,IronHorseComics,it's been years since I've been to Red Lobster
16-08-2019T15:24:20,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve yet to go to a red lobster

16-08-2019T15:24:45,Mippy,Hey Ord
16-08-2019T15:25:05,FoxxTrotter,"Sanitary Fish Market & Restaurant is pretty good here in NC, but it's down on the coast."
16-08-2019T15:25:24,MatyMaty,There is no Red Lobster in my country VwV
16-08-2019T15:25:34,FoxxTrotter,BBQ places are big where I'm at around here.

16-08-2019T15:33:22,SageSaga,maybe because it's hungry
16-08-2019T15:34:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m not entirely sure he’s a cat
16-08-2019T15:34:06,FreedomCrusader,Lurker mode is what I ahve been doing the past hour
16-08-2019T15:34:19,Mippy,Cat food dose not taste as good as dog food
16-08-2019T15:34:40,SageSaga,My cat attacked a toddler - and i warned the kids mother- was the cat listening in when i told her? No- the cat does what it does O_O
16-08-2019T15:35:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera will eat most anything

16-08-2019T16:11:59,ZRO4825,It used to be big on the radio here. I stopped listening to the radio too because they kept replaying the same stuff ad infinitum. :joy:
16-08-2019T16:12:36,TeapotOfDoom,to be continued...
16-08-2019T16:13:05,TeapotOfDoom,that came unexpected lol

16-08-2019T16:25:50,SageSaga,when you asked about playing Far Cry 5- you said play it earlier- is that so you didnt have to stream it with me?
16-08-2019T16:26:12,LannAF,no because otherwise I wouldn't be able to play for long
16-08-2019T16:26:17,LannAF,And that was for saturday

16-08-2019T16:29:10,LannAF,didn't you say you'd have to do sunday earlier for some reason?
16-08-2019T16:29:15,LannAF,or was that only for lunch
16-08-2019T16:29:42,SageSaga,"you said early on Sunday and i said ""I can play after i fix lunch for the family at the earliest"""
16-08-2019T16:30:13,LannAF,huh
16-08-2019T16:30:16,LannAF,Yeah you're right
16-08-2019T16:30:22,LannAF,Why did I need it to be -that- early...
16-08-2019T16:30:41,SageSaga,because you stream later
16-08-2019T16:30:49,LannAF,no streaming far cry is fine
16-08-2019T16:30:59,SageSaga,and im not funny enough to be on your stream!
16-08-2019T16:30:59,LannAF,there was either something else or I got confused
16-08-2019T16:31:04,LannAF,boi
16-08-2019T16:31:31,LannAF,everyone is funny with me around :sunglasses:
16-08-2019T16:31:39,LannAF,(it was a joke please don't stab me)
16-08-2019T16:31:54,TeapotOfDoom,puts back the knife
16-08-2019T16:31:56,TeapotOfDoom,awww
16-08-2019T16:32:29,LannAF,it's more like I'm not funny unless I have other people around as catalysts
16-08-2019T16:32:57,SageSaga,i had so many troll plans for Minecraft that were also not harmful...
16-08-2019T16:33:03,LannAF,pffffft
16-08-2019T16:33:09,LannAF,like this?
16-08-2019T16:33:17,LannAF,wait
16-08-2019T16:33:19,LannAF,I'll link in pms
16-08-2019T16:33:59,SageSaga,No - good ones
16-08-2019T16:34:12,LannAF,wow rude
16-08-2019T16:36:16,SageSaga,was looking at mods on the server for Fake TNT or if i could make a thing that prevents explosive damage
16-08-2019T16:36:47,SageSaga,and i would add a trap door in your base to drop you in a room with TNT  going off all around you
16-08-2019T16:36:49,TeapotOfDoom,You can make a plugin out of this
16-08-2019T16:38:12,SageSaga,i even planned to put a dimensional anchor down so you couldnt teleport out of the trap
16-08-2019T16:39:59,SageSaga,i was also planning on bulding a giant Fox under your house since you use teleport to go through your walls- eventually you would teleport into it
16-08-2019T16:40:50,SageSaga,and no i wasnt going to then explode it
16-08-2019T16:41:47,LannAF,d'awwww
16-08-2019T16:41:55,LannAF,I was given a fox gift
16-08-2019T16:42:54,LannAF,I require
16-08-2019T16:42:55,LannAF,MORE
16-08-2019T16:42:58,SageSaga,I was also hoping to be able to build while y'all were away and make a castle with cool loots and puzzles to solve
16-08-2019T16:43:04,Sclimshady,:cw0lfmare-Sylvblep:
16-08-2019T16:43:08,LannAF,that actually sounds fricking awesome
16-08-2019T16:43:21,SageSaga,but y'all said no
16-08-2019T16:43:43,AnuSekaniArt,Back
16-08-2019T16:43:43,LannAF,"I advocated, but the others a bit iffy on it purely because of, well, a few reasons"
16-08-2019T16:43:46,LannAF,Not specific to you.
16-08-2019T16:43:50,LannAF,it's just in general
16-08-2019T16:43:52,AnuSekaniArt,PC has been assembled slightly more XD
16-08-2019T16:43:58,LannAF,we weren't even planning on doing MC
16-08-2019T16:44:11,LannAF,and we have tons of other games that we're supposed to be doing instead
16-08-2019T16:44:22,LannAF,we might just end up dropping it pretty soon
16-08-2019T16:44:31,SageSaga,no I get it- Kameloh doesnt like me
16-08-2019T16:44:37,FreedomCrusader,For how long has this pc been slowly assembled?
16-08-2019T16:44:39,LannAF,wat
16-08-2019T16:44:53,LannAF,kameloh's not the leader and he does like you xD
16-08-2019T16:45:06,LannAF,"nobody's a leader, I guess"
16-08-2019T16:45:10,SageSaga,it's Kamelohs server
16-08-2019T16:45:14,ZRO4825,I was a leader once.
16-08-2019T16:45:18,ZRO4825,Ye gods was that a mistake.
16-08-2019T16:45:22,LannAF,it's a group decision tho
16-08-2019T16:46:17,AnuSekaniArt,"@FreedomCrusader I started last night, went super late, and did a little bit just now."
16-08-2019T16:46:19,SageSaga,the council of Dragonsquad decided they dont want Sage - even though 2 members are close friends
16-08-2019T16:47:23,LannAF,>_>
16-08-2019T16:47:42,Yevni,sagesagesagesagesagesagesagesagesagesagesagesage
16-08-2019T16:47:44,Yevni,ahoy
16-08-2019T16:47:50,Yevni,hope you are having a good day
16-08-2019T16:48:02,SageSaga,i can do math! That means if the group decided- then either everyone but you two said no- or - gasp! You and Tom dont want me playing!
16-08-2019T16:48:11,SageSaga,yo Yevni ^^
16-08-2019T16:48:18,Yevni,Yoyo's are cool
16-08-2019T16:49:32,AnuSekaniArt,Allo Yevni ^^
16-08-2019T16:49:42,TeapotOfDoom,That's quite the statement to make
16-08-2019T16:49:45,LannAF,except it's dependant on factors that don't necessarily have to do with you :P
16-08-2019T16:50:20,TeapotOfDoom,Do you have evidence to back up your statement Yenvi?
16-08-2019T16:50:21,SageSaga,right - of course - there's a hard cap on the number of people that can play on a Minecraft server-
16-08-2019T16:50:25,TeapotOfDoom,Also hi lol
16-08-2019T16:50:53,Yevni,Uhhhhhhhhh yes
16-08-2019T16:50:56,Yevni,I heard yo like yos with yo yos so we got yo yos for yo yo so yo can yo while yo yo
16-08-2019T16:52:18,TeapotOfDoom,Yo
16-08-2019T16:53:24,Yevni,Yo yo yo with yo yo yo yo?
16-08-2019T16:55:38,TeapotOfDoom,Finished inking the head and neck
16-08-2019T16:55:41,TeapotOfDoom,nice
16-08-2019T16:55:54,TeapotOfDoom,onto the arms
16-08-2019T16:59:10,Yevni,Kaylin's : O and Nyna's D:
16-08-2019T17:02:13,ZRO4825,:csagesaga-kaylinheart:

16-08-2019T17:04:31,AnuSekaniArt,:csagesaga-kaylinheart:Loving this <3
16-08-2019T17:05:10,ZRO4825,"I can't remember, was that scaled down from another spot, or did you draw that specifically for the emotes, Sage?"
16-08-2019T17:06:43,SageSaga,specifically for an emote
16-08-2019T17:07:14,ZRO4825,Righto.
16-08-2019T17:07:58,Ordithus,:csagesaga-philhuh: they are great emotes
16-08-2019T17:08:31,Nekonny,o/p

16-08-2019T17:09:39,IronHorseComics,Hi Ron
16-08-2019T17:10:18,TeapotOfDoom,Hi Ron!
16-08-2019T17:10:26,IronHorseComics,"so, you used a REAL steam engine for that Komeno Cafe, what class?"
16-08-2019T17:10:33,Nekonny,XD
16-08-2019T17:10:48,Nekonny,in world it's steam yeah
16-08-2019T17:10:57,Nekonny,at the con it was a battery operated one XD
16-08-2019T17:10:59,AnuSekaniArt,Hello Nekonny!
16-08-2019T17:11:04,IronHorseComics,...
16-08-2019T17:11:24,Nekonny,Heya Anu!
16-08-2019T17:11:35,Nekonny,"Sorry Iron, I missd the joke ^^"""
16-08-2019T17:11:42,IronHorseComics,I wasn't joking
16-08-2019T17:11:50,Nekonny,"also, hi ord, foxx and tea"
16-08-2019T17:12:16,Nekonny,you mean in comic then?
16-08-2019T17:12:33,IronHorseComics,at least from the artwork on the site
16-08-2019T17:12:42,Nekonny,"yes, it's a steam engine"
16-08-2019T17:12:52,IronHorseComics,"clearly, a German one at that"
16-08-2019T17:13:24,IronHorseComics,you have no clue how irritating it is to me to see people draw steam engines so poorly
16-08-2019T17:13:31,Nekonny,"Well, at first yes, but I switched to a japanesse one of simmilar build"
16-08-2019T17:13:33,TeapotOfDoom,lol
16-08-2019T17:14:20,IronHorseComics,well that would explain the lack of buffers
16-08-2019T17:14:38,AnuSekaniArt,"Welp, I gotta head off to D&D."
16-08-2019T17:14:45,AnuSekaniArt,"Thanks for streaming Sage, keep up the great work!"

16-08-2019T18:34:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera is starting to concern me
16-08-2019T18:35:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"looking me right in the eye, tapping the pillow with his foot"
16-08-2019T18:37:23,SomeNiceUser,:ptv-uneasy:
16-08-2019T18:41:35,SomeNiceUser,So how is everyone.

16-08-2019T18:41:42,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s like he’s high but tryin to act normal
16-08-2019T18:42:20,SomeNiceUser,I’m concerned.
16-08-2019T18:42:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I came back from walking so I am sweaty
16-08-2019T18:43:23,SpazztasticKiwi,and Tom you can have your curse back
16-08-2019T18:52:42,IronHorseComics,what curse?
16-08-2019T18:53:01,Twokinds,Thanks
16-08-2019T18:55:19,SpazztasticKiwi,power went out 4 am for no good reason
16-08-2019T18:56:09,SpazztasticKiwi,"considering it gets warm about 7-8 and it didn’t return till around 8, was not a fan"
16-08-2019T18:56:23,SpazztasticKiwi,so he can have that mess back
16-08-2019T19:53:02,Mikemkke034,Heyo
16-08-2019T20:31:52,SpazztasticKiwi,not much going today
16-08-2019T20:32:09,SpazztasticKiwi,everyone’s been popping in then back out
16-08-2019T20:43:00,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-karenOOO:
16-08-2019T20:44:18,IronHorseComics,ohhh I've been busy
16-08-2019T20:45:27,IronHorseComics,I managed to finish my Kat thrill ride as well as the comic lineart
16-08-2019T21:00:34,ZahnHolley,I’m bored
16-08-2019T21:12:04,SpazztasticKiwi,hi board go meet my friends hammer 🔨 and nail 🔩 and build a house 🏠
16-08-2019T21:39:20,SpazztasticKiwi,might be asleep on lann’s stream
16-08-2019T21:39:32,SpazztasticKiwi,just a feeling
16-08-2019T21:41:06,Mikemkke034,I've been trying to get work/school done :yum:
16-08-2019T21:45:30,Mikemkke034,"Also, is anyone planning on going to Anthrocon next year?"
16-08-2019T21:50:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m thinking on it
16-08-2019T21:50:39,SpazztasticKiwi,there’s no telling since it’d just be me and the only thing to base it on is when I went to PAX
16-08-2019T21:50:53,SpazztasticKiwi,and I was with a friend then
16-08-2019T21:53:03,Mikemkke034,"You're talking about the one in Pittsburgh, right?"
16-08-2019T21:55:37,SpazztasticKiwi,yup
16-08-2019T21:56:08,SpazztasticKiwi,dunno what tickets are like - gotta look at hotels - gotta look at flight
16-08-2019T21:56:47,Mikemkke034,"Same, and I was looking at registration fees. The tickets I would want are $150+"
16-08-2019T21:56:58,SpazztasticKiwi,look at maps for directions and food places - get a good idea of what where and where what sort of thing
16-08-2019T21:57:10,Mikemkke034,"That's w/o flight/driving, hotels, and/or food"
16-08-2019T21:57:20,SpazztasticKiwi,exactly
16-08-2019T21:57:45,SpazztasticKiwi,going alone it may do me better to stick with visiting New Orleans
16-08-2019T21:57:46,Mikemkke034,"Funny thing is, I have me and a friend wanting to go (We live in the same town)"
16-08-2019T21:58:14,Mikemkke034,Plus a friend from colorado wanting to meet me in Pittsburgh suring the convention
16-08-2019T21:58:18,Mikemkke034,during*
16-08-2019T22:20:54,Sclimshady,"Im looking to go. I could swing the whole trip for 800 if  I go air bnb,  less if I get some people to room with"
16-08-2019T22:31:46,AspiringNoodle,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
16-08-2019T22:31:50,AspiringNoodle,Hello everybody
16-08-2019T22:31:52,AspiringNoodle,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
16-08-2019T22:33:57,SpazztasticKiwi,air bnb don’t appeal to me well
16-08-2019T22:35:47,SpazztasticKiwi,with friends from home yeah sure but as unfortunate as it is I’d rather pay for me than room with others for just a little cheaper
16-08-2019T22:37:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t know anything about Pittsburgh but I’ve been investigating New Orleans for a week now so it’d be like going to square one
16-08-2019T22:38:10,AspiringNoodle,My feet hurt ;_;
16-08-2019T22:38:14,Mikemkke034,Noodle!
16-08-2019T22:38:28,AspiringNoodle,"And all you need to know is that the rest of PA hates Pittsburgh alongside Philadelphia, lol"
16-08-2019T22:40:17,Mikemkke034,Lol
16-08-2019T22:53:12,Sclimshady,Just like California hates LA and SF
16-08-2019T22:53:53,AspiringNoodle,"Good rule of thumb.  If the majority of a state is Red, but the vote is controlled by a few blue dots"
16-08-2019T22:54:01,AspiringNoodle,Those dots are public enemy #1 XD
16-08-2019T22:54:15,Sclimshady,"Also, it's like 1200 for a hotel but 200 for bnb or I wouldn't even consider it"
16-08-2019T23:06:27,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m not booking a bnb
16-08-2019T23:06:46,SpazztasticKiwi,it’ll end up being strangers unless I find people I know are going too
16-08-2019T23:08:05,Sclimshady,"Its an entire apartment for 40 a night,  no one else will be there"
16-08-2019T23:16:31,AspiringNoodle,*learns he works full time next week*
16-08-2019T23:16:40,AspiringNoodle,"""Save me, boss-sama!!!"" :ptv-whiny:"
16-08-2019T23:18:26,AspiringNoodle,My feet can barely make it 1 8-hour shift
16-08-2019T23:18:34,AspiringNoodle,And this week is basically a double set of 2
16-08-2019T23:18:47,AspiringNoodle,My body is not ready :ptv-shock:
16-08-2019T23:28:40,Sclimshady,Lann is live btw
16-08-2019T23:34:21,SpazztasticKiwi,with a whole 3 watching
16-08-2019T23:34:47,SpazztasticKiwi,and I don’t see myself using an apartment for four days alone
16-08-2019T23:36:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m probably jumping back to yt
