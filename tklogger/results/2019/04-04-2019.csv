04-04-2019T20:38:01,SageSaga,dont you love it when people try to make it seem like your pain doesnt matter because there are worse pains?
04-04-2019T20:38:03,ZephyrTWolffox,foodies
04-04-2019T20:38:11,CatzArt,nope
04-04-2019T20:38:14,EdTheFolf,"All the pain is bad, Sage"
04-04-2019T20:38:26,Nekonny,I think they are jest trying to say they can relate
04-04-2019T20:38:29,ZRO4825,"Yeah, sucks when people gotta be like that, Sage. >:("
04-04-2019T20:38:29,BadFoMo,Sorry.
04-04-2019T20:38:31,Nekonny,*just
04-04-2019T20:39:42,Tharkis,i thought this song was repetative
04-04-2019T20:39:51,SageSaga,"""Ouch! I stubbed my toe!"" ""Could be worse, you could have toe cancer"" ""Thanks?"""
04-04-2019T20:39:51,Tharkis,apperantly my youtue random playlist has landed on a 1 hour mix
04-04-2019T20:39:57,BadFoMo,"...Also, ""Pain is your friend."" -Jamie Hydamen (Name may be butchered.)"
04-04-2019T20:40:12,EdTheFolf,Is that the guy from MythBusters?
04-04-2019T20:40:21,BadFoMo,One of them.
04-04-2019T20:40:55,BadFoMo,"...From the orignal run, anyway."
04-04-2019T20:41:01,FloofyCat,"Sage, you're dying of toe cancer? You could be dying of cancer in both toes!"
04-04-2019T20:41:06,EdTheFolf,"It really wasn't my friend, more like a literal pain in the butt."
04-04-2019T20:41:30,neropan,could be worse if you stubb all your toes at the saem time
04-04-2019T20:41:36,neropan,heya everyone
04-04-2019T20:41:38,FloofyCat,Therefore all your pain is invalidated because someone somewhere is feeling more pain
04-04-2019T20:41:39,MarvTheHugPharaoh,NERO!!!! <3
04-04-2019T20:41:53,ZephyrTWolffox,Hai!

04-04-2019T20:42:53,ZephyrTWolffox,okey can we stop talking about things that hurt so much they make you wish you were dead?
04-04-2019T20:42:58,neropan,testicular distortion
04-04-2019T20:43:02,neropan,sounds epic
04-04-2019T20:43:09,unsteddyphoenix,D: D: D:
04-04-2019T20:43:17,Tharkis,"what's that? you want to talk about kidney stones, zephyrtwolffox? =D"
04-04-2019T20:43:19,Tharkis,ducks
04-04-2019T20:43:25,ZephyrTWolffox,NNNGGGGGGGGG
04-04-2019T20:43:27,Tharkis,"sounds like a band name, Neropan"
04-04-2019T20:43:34,FloofyCat,Lego socks.
04-04-2019T20:43:35,MarvTheHugPharaoh,testicular conniption
04-04-2019T20:43:35,neropan,now that just sounds like a lovecraftian creature
04-04-2019T20:43:37,Mippy,XD torsion
04-04-2019T20:43:42,FloofyCat,Every step is on a lego.
04-04-2019T20:43:49,EdTheFolf,better than that weird band with a long and gory name
04-04-2019T20:43:56,EdTheFolf,whatever it was called
04-04-2019T20:43:58,Tharkis,"lol, i'm re-reading the complete works of H.P. Lovecraft right now"
04-04-2019T20:44:02,BadFoMo,@FloofyCat I think so.

04-04-2019T20:45:41,LannAF,Hello Mip with a Py xD
04-04-2019T20:45:41,Tharkis,unless you count cthulhu's face
04-04-2019T20:45:54,SageSaga,Arent they finally making a Mountains of Madness Movie?
04-04-2019T20:46:00,EdTheFolf,is cthulhu an instrument?
04-04-2019T20:46:01,Aimbotexe,"Red: Hand over mouth, Raine: Panicking, Me: Desiring to know more"
04-04-2019T20:46:02,neropan,i was reading randolf carter tales
04-04-2019T20:46:02,LannAF,Hiya Unsteddy. Did you watch the clip we made yesterday?
04-04-2019T20:46:03,RaptorARTStudios,:craptorartstudios-afk:  bio
04-04-2019T20:46:05,neropan,good stuf
04-04-2019T20:46:05,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:eyes:
04-04-2019T20:46:06,BadFoMo,"...So, what /is/ @RaptorARTStudios doing right now?"
04-04-2019T20:46:08,Nekonny,Nero!
04-04-2019T20:46:09,LannAF,Hi Sage!
04-04-2019T20:46:14,Nekonny,"Man, long time no see!"
04-04-2019T20:46:16,FoxxTrotter,"Hi, Lann."
04-04-2019T20:46:17,Tharkis,"i heard they were discussing it, yet again. but i dont know that it's actually being made"
04-04-2019T20:46:27,LannAF,Heya Foxx :D
04-04-2019T20:46:29,BadFoMo,BIO?
04-04-2019T20:46:29,Tharkis,there are so many movies that were derivative of mountains of madness
04-04-2019T20:46:33,neropan,hoi hoi ron long time indeed
04-04-2019T20:46:36,Tharkis,that studios are reluctant to do the original
04-04-2019T20:46:43,FoxxTrotter,"E'lo, Nero."
04-04-2019T20:47:00,neropan,was having some stuff to figure out here recently but back like a good boi
04-04-2019T20:47:01,Tharkis,"carpenter's the thing was heavily influenced by it, as was Mouth of Madness"
04-04-2019T20:47:06,Mippy,Wouldn’t know....haven’t read Lovecraft.
04-04-2019T20:47:22,Tharkis,lovecraft is good and easy reading
04-04-2019T20:47:32,Tharkis,very approachable
04-04-2019T20:47:43,SageSaga,unless you are black
04-04-2019T20:47:56,Tharkis,a.nd a lot of what lovecraftian horror is would these days be considered sci-fi not horror
04-04-2019T20:47:59,SageSaga,you do not want to approach Lovecraft if you are black
04-04-2019T20:48:01,neropan,h peep lovecraft
04-04-2019T20:48:08,Mippy,I have a small volume of his work. It’s just sitting on my shelf.
04-04-2019T20:48:10,ZephyrTWolffox,:?
04-04-2019T20:48:12,SageSaga,he was very racist
04-04-2019T20:48:27,LannAF,Was he? O_o
04-04-2019T20:48:27,Mippy,^Thats what I hear
04-04-2019T20:48:29,Tharkis,no doubt about that
04-04-2019T20:48:32,Tharkis,but
04-04-2019T20:48:42,SageSaga,yeah -he often used black people in stories as monsters themselves
04-04-2019T20:49:03,unsteddyphoenix,lmao
04-04-2019T20:49:10,SageSaga,its a great example of someone giving us this amazing thing for stories- but he was not himself a good person at alllll
04-04-2019T20:49:10,unsteddyphoenix,Idk a black dude could find that funny
04-04-2019T20:49:33,Tharkis,i think a lot of it was the product of his times unfortunately
04-04-2019T20:49:34,SageSaga,possibly
04-04-2019T20:49:41,Tharkis,the USA as a whole was very racist then
04-04-2019T20:49:46,Tharkis,the whole era of jim crow laws and whatnot
04-04-2019T20:50:13,SageSaga,uhh
04-04-2019T20:50:14,SageSaga,no
04-04-2019T20:50:28,SageSaga,Jim Crow was waaaay after Lovecraft
04-04-2019T20:50:41,SageSaga,he was from the late 1800s to WW2
04-04-2019T20:50:47,Tharkis,jim crow is what arose from lovecraft's time
04-04-2019T20:50:49,LannAF,"Didn't know that sage, whoah"
04-04-2019T20:51:00,SageSaga,Jim Crow was from the 60s right?
04-04-2019T20:51:10,SageSaga,oh right
04-04-2019T20:51:11,Tharkis,jim crow laws
04-04-2019T20:51:14,Dimensional,I know what Red needs to help Raine out. Magicked into half-n-half like Raine. Make her feel less self-concious.
04-04-2019T20:51:14,SageSaga,ended in the 60s
04-04-2019T20:51:16,Tharkis,were from 1890s through 60s
04-04-2019T20:51:18,Tharkis,they ended in 64
04-04-2019T20:51:19,Mippy,Who the frack is Jim Crow?
04-04-2019T20:51:22,Tharkis,with the civil right's act
04-04-2019T20:51:29,SageSaga,yeah i got confused with my dates
04-04-2019T20:51:38,FoxxTrotter,Jim Crow is a slang term for a black man.
04-04-2019T20:51:43,FoxxTrotter,It's not a person.
04-04-2019T20:52:04,neropan,jimmy neutron
04-04-2019T20:52:09,Tharkis,usually the 'jim crow' era is 1877 - 1964
04-04-2019T20:52:13,Tharkis,the end of reconstruction
04-04-2019T20:52:17,ChrisSketch,Gu
04-04-2019T20:52:18,SageSaga,remember the crows from Jungle Book?
04-04-2019T20:52:19,ChrisSketch,hi
04-04-2019T20:52:20,Tharkis,till the signing of the civil right's act
04-04-2019T20:52:22,BadFoMo,@Dimensional I can get behind that.
04-04-2019T20:52:50,Mippy,@SageSaga yes
04-04-2019T20:52:51,Chalodraws,Jungle Book or Dumbp?
04-04-2019T20:53:01,kittyelfie,Dumbo
04-04-2019T20:53:30,kittyelfie,I think the most racist moment in any Disney movie was the Indians in Peter Pan.
04-04-2019T20:53:38,SageSaga,right Dumbo
04-04-2019T20:53:46,Tharkis,unfortunately US history classes teach very little about actual US history from a cultural and social perspective
04-04-2019T20:53:48,SageSaga,Junglebook had different racism XD
04-04-2019T20:53:58,BadFoMo,I think the Crows were in Dumbo; it was the ape in The Jungle Book.
04-04-2019T20:54:04,Mippy,King Louie
04-04-2019T20:54:13,BadFoMo,Thanks you!
04-04-2019T20:54:19,ZRO4825,"I kinda dislike labeling everything as ""racist."" There's a difference between racism and stereotyping imo."
04-04-2019T20:54:20,SageSaga,yep - im backwards again on my stuff tonight
04-04-2019T20:54:21,BadFoMo,*Thank
04-04-2019T20:54:22,Tharkis,br'er rabbit was pretty @#@#% racist too
04-04-2019T20:54:29,kittyelfie,I think of the crows as smack talking zoot suits
04-04-2019T20:54:31,Tharkis,disney was full of racism
04-04-2019T20:54:42,SageSaga,mostly for the Jews
04-04-2019T20:54:45,Dimensional,How old is Raine? And is that in Keidran years or human years?
04-04-2019T20:54:51,Aimbotexe,18 human
04-04-2019T20:54:54,Mippy,18
04-04-2019T20:55:20,Aimbotexe,I guessing that translates to 9 in keidran
04-04-2019T20:55:39,Dimensional,I thought Keidran's age after.
04-04-2019T20:55:48,kittyelfie,"To be honest, modern stuff has plenty of racism against Jews, too.  Star Trek's Ferengi.  Harry Potter's gnome bankers.  Star Wars' guy who owned Anakin."
04-04-2019T20:55:59,SageSaga,XD
04-04-2019T20:56:18,Chalodraws,goblin bankers.
04-04-2019T20:56:26,SageSaga,"the Goblins in HP i dont think were ""jews"""
04-04-2019T20:56:35,Chalodraws,no need for the gnome racism. XD
04-04-2019T20:56:38,kittyelfie,They matched the 1930's propaganda
04-04-2019T20:56:42,neropan,gnomed
