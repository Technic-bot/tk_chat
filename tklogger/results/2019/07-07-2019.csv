07-07-2019T00:45:46,SpazztasticKiwi,"until I find out what kind of unholy leftovers from God‚Äôs dinosaur crack bucket landed on me, imma lose a few shades of shit"
07-07-2019T00:47:13,SpazztasticKiwi,bitch looks like he came from God‚Äôs deviantart phase. Just dropping new dlcs without warning
07-07-2019T01:03:53,SpazztasticKiwi,I wonder if I just have days where swearing is my complete vocabulary

07-07-2019T03:51:37,AspiringNoodle,Hey terra ^^;
07-07-2019T03:51:59,AspiringNoodle,My head is spinning from all this research around the new ryzen stuff
07-07-2019T03:55:52,TerraTheWizard,was trying to make a pun there
07-07-2019T03:55:56,TerraTheWizard,but i got nothing
07-07-2019T04:04:45,AspiringNoodle,"I'm still relatively new to the community, so I don't know all the jokes :ptv-hearts:"
07-07-2019T04:05:32,AspiringNoodle,I'm absolutely fascinated by Zen 2.  AMD really does have their product straddling the razor's edge.
07-07-2019T04:05:45,TerraTheWizard,"thought i could make a pun on ryzen, turns out it's too early for me to tHink of good puns"
07-07-2019T04:05:52,AspiringNoodle,:P
07-07-2019T04:05:58,AspiringNoodle,Tell me if this is fascinating
07-07-2019T04:06:12,AspiringNoodle,"For once, overclocking a CPU may *NOT* be the way to get the best performance"
07-07-2019T04:07:36,AspiringNoodle,"Also, Ryzen is a pun in and of itself, so making a pun of a pun is probably exponentially more difficult :ptv-laugh:"
07-07-2019T04:21:15,AspiringNoodle,"Terra, you looking to build a new computer? xD"
07-07-2019T04:24:42,TerraTheWizard,not any time soon :P
07-07-2019T04:25:12,AspiringNoodle,"I'm gonna drive myself mad at this rate, so good on ya xD"
07-07-2019T04:33:56,AspiringNoodle,There's a lot of conflicting reviews out there.
07-07-2019T04:35:33,AspiringNoodle,"Biggest thing that might be driving it is that some studios are using 3200CL14 (last gen sweetspot) and others 3600CL16 (current gen sweetspot) memory.  Because Zen 2 does benefit massively from better memory, still."
07-07-2019T04:58:13,AspiringNoodle,Pardon me while I watch youtube for the next 3 hours to let my brain stop cooking

07-07-2019T12:37:07,Xexanoth,yay NibblyBot is back
07-07-2019T12:38:18,Twokinds,"I have returned from the con. I am tired, but alive."
07-07-2019T12:38:49,iliar,Yay. Tom is back.
07-07-2019T12:38:58,Twokinds,I drove the entire way back nonstop starting at midnight and getting home at 4am. Phew. That was tough.
07-07-2019T12:39:13,iliar,In the photos I saw a lot of new interesting merch.
07-07-2019T12:39:38,iliar,How much is it in kilometers / miles?
07-07-2019T12:40:41,Twokinds,"It's not a terribly long drive, but it felt long, being so late at night."
07-07-2019T12:41:08,Twokinds,"According to google, it's 463.8 km"
07-07-2019T12:42:25,iliar,"Hmm, that's not very much. And honestly, I like to ride at night. But you worked all day, so yes, it was probably exhausting."
07-07-2019T12:42:36,Twokinds,I slept well
07-07-2019T12:42:50,Twokinds,"It was a lot of fun, though."

07-07-2019T12:45:06,Twokinds,I was SO busy the entire convention. I had to take several sketches home to finish.
07-07-2019T12:45:17,TerraTheWizard,wow
07-07-2019T12:46:20,iliar,Tom can you explain what is it? https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/359539122496339968/596721676096372747/IMG_20190705_111008.jpg

07-07-2019T12:49:12,Twokinds,Oh!
07-07-2019T12:49:22,Twokinds,I bought a new set of grey markers and wanted to try them out
07-07-2019T12:49:46,iliar,lol
07-07-2019T12:49:56,Twokinds,"I made that. I planned to do others, but didn't have time, so that ended up being the only one."
07-07-2019T12:50:26,Twokinds,I'm honestly no good with physical media

07-07-2019T12:56:45,CrimsonQuill,"So how are yo, Tom?"
07-07-2019T12:56:47,Twokinds,Sage was afraid a furry would stab him.
07-07-2019T12:56:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Why was stabbed your first reaction should we be concerned
07-07-2019T12:56:59,Xexanoth,....why?
07-07-2019T12:57:34,Twokinds,I dunno sage put the idea in my head
07-07-2019T12:57:36,SpazztasticKiwi,if you‚Äôve ever seen one of those suits you know you can hide some fancy stuff in em
07-07-2019T12:57:48,SpazztasticKiwi,no one tell him that tho

07-07-2019T12:59:10,CrimsonQuill,And has a habit of plonking his arse in our bedrooms when he isn't wished for.
07-07-2019T12:59:18,SpazztasticKiwi,there‚Äôs a dog called coconut rice bear that‚Äôs been popping up on my fb feed lately
07-07-2019T12:59:31,CrimsonQuill,But we cuddle him anyway because he wants love and hugs.

07-07-2019T13:07:28,CrimsonQuill,I found out about it from Jacksepticeye...
07-07-2019T13:07:41,CrimsonQuill,I saw him play a bit of it and played it myself.
07-07-2019T13:07:52,CrimsonQuill,It's from the same person who made 'You left me'.
07-07-2019T13:08:08,CrimsonQuill,It deals with depression and suicide...and is incredibly deep for me.
07-07-2019T13:08:25,CrimsonQuill,I recommend you play it.

07-07-2019T16:10:08,AspiringNoodle,"A blow-for-blow comparison between the 3700x/3900x and the 9900k, with both sides giving their all"
07-07-2019T16:10:31,AspiringNoodle,"That means all 8 cores running at 5Ghz for the 9900k, and the AMD side running at 4.3Ghz all cores, using 3600CL16 memory :D"
