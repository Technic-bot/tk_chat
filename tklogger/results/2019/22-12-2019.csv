22-12-2019T12:03:00,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t particularly want to work today but its also my last day before Christmas break
22-12-2019T12:04:24,ThingsAreMoving,"Final stretch, Kiwi. :ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:"
22-12-2019T12:07:18,SpazztasticKiwi,but the only stretching I wanna do is in my blankiesw
22-12-2019T12:09:11,ThingsAreMoving,I get ya. How long is your shift anyway?
22-12-2019T12:12:36,SpazztasticKiwi,full
22-12-2019T12:17:53,ThingsAreMoving,"Eight hours, then?"
22-12-2019T12:19:12,ThingsAreMoving,or nine with an hour unpaid lunch time
22-12-2019T12:26:17,SpazztasticKiwi,7ish hours with unpaid lunch
22-12-2019T12:27:09,ThingsAreMoving,Well I wish you only non-retarded customers today. Best of luck!
22-12-2019T12:29:12,SpazztasticKiwi,but provided it’s the holidays and how it’s most often only one or two people for two departments upkeep & work you don’t get done right at time
22-12-2019T12:29:34,SpazztasticKiwi,and most any work is dependent on if everyone lights the fire of motivation under their asses
22-12-2019T13:40:09,AspiringNoodle,I've stopped trying to get everything done while I'm at work ;)
22-12-2019T13:40:34,AspiringNoodle,I get as much done as I can because corporated can't be assed to give the store enough hours to get things done
22-12-2019T13:41:30,AspiringNoodle,"Case-in-point, next two days I work for 6 hours, and the other person on shift will be alone for 2 - 3 hours.  So anything that's done will be while I'm there"
