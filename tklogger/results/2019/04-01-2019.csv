04-01-2019T00:26:40,Mippy,Robbing a bank
04-01-2019T00:26:52,unsteddyphoenix,I guess the IDEA is simple...

04-01-2019T00:48:30,Mippy,There aren’t even light posts...just nothing
04-01-2019T00:48:58,CrRAR,lameee... sidewalks or no?
04-01-2019T00:49:23,unsteddyphoenix,Weird.
04-01-2019T00:49:27,Mippy,Most of the way...it’s more of a paved bike trail
04-01-2019T00:49:30,unsteddyphoenix,Live out in the country or somethin'?
04-01-2019T00:49:45,unsteddyphoenix,Sounds dangerous for bikers if theres no lights :thinking:
04-01-2019T00:50:12,Mippy,Nope...just outside of the city. The trail wraps around a storm retention pond
04-01-2019T00:50:39,Mippy,It’s jist bad design
04-01-2019T00:50:47,CrRAR,yeah
04-01-2019T00:54:14,Mippy,You can imagine the anxiety I felt walking that. Especially since everyone is aware that girls go missing here pretty frequently.
04-01-2019T00:55:37,CrRAR,"Yeah, sad reality but travel in groups if ya can."
04-01-2019T00:56:05,CrRAR,Is it a really long distance?
04-01-2019T00:56:46,Mippy,Probably 15 minutes if the weather is good. Still enough time to go missing though
04-01-2019T00:58:26,Mippy,Not something I do on a regular basis though. I mostly travel in the day.
04-01-2019T00:59:13,CrRAR,yeah this time of year is just short on daylight.
04-01-2019T00:59:26,unsteddyphoenix,Scary
04-01-2019T00:59:32,unsteddyphoenix,Be safe kids
04-01-2019T00:59:32,CrRAR,so it's probably tougher to avoid
04-01-2019T00:59:51,Mippy,"Exactly, sun sets around 4PM"
04-01-2019T01:00:20,Twokinds,Done
04-01-2019T01:00:23,Mippy,Don’t come up till prid near 10Am

04-01-2019T01:01:04,Bgrmystr2,that lizard does not fuck around
04-01-2019T01:01:11,CrRAR,It's a little safer if it's more often travelled
04-01-2019T01:01:15,unsteddyphoenix,Nice work
04-01-2019T01:01:25,unsteddyphoenix,Its breaking A wall
04-01-2019T01:01:30,Mippy,People mostly drive. You may see one person walking a dog
04-01-2019T01:01:36,CrRAR,biiig lizard ruins the wall
04-01-2019T01:01:38,CrRAR,the door
04-01-2019T01:01:39,unsteddyphoenix,You'd think the security lizard wouldnt break the area it's supposed to be securing

04-01-2019T01:03:55,Twokinds,"Anyway, I can't draw anymore, cause Alexa says it's time for bed and the colors of my monitor have all shifted."

04-01-2019T11:53:11,Twokinds,A macro is a set of preprogrammed actions.
04-01-2019T11:53:35,Twokinds,"Like in Photoshop, I can record myself doing several things, and then later, I can just push a button and it does all those things automatically, so I never have to do it again."

04-01-2019T14:31:06,CrRAR,Yeah some of the stuff you may not ever see again depending on what you branch into.

04-01-2019T20:11:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I was at work
04-01-2019T20:12:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Which reminds me: a lady came by and asked if we had Cajun roast beef. We don’t and haven’t for awhile as they’ve taken off our products list
04-01-2019T20:13:14,SpazztasticKiwi,She was informed of this and stormed off like we’d insulted her first born
04-01-2019T20:16:57,SpazztasticKiwi,"On the bright side, one of the stock ladies told me I got pretty eyes"

04-01-2019T20:22:49,ThingsAreMoving,I've been told many times I have eyes that girls will be / are envious about.
04-01-2019T20:23:07,ThingsAreMoving,I think it's the long eyelashes or something.
04-01-2019T20:23:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Yes
04-01-2019T20:23:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Guys often have thicker lashes
04-01-2019T20:23:28,SpazztasticKiwi,For some unfair reason
04-01-2019T20:24:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Mine are decently long and ok thick. But I still wear mascara - all it does is add a darker color
04-01-2019T20:26:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Not a fan of falsies or anything that’s gonna over coat - that’s how you can end up causing or encouraging lash loss. But the reason most people seem to like my eyes is they’re green
04-01-2019T20:27:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Especially since I don’t wear makeup often. Another reason they’re not damaged
04-01-2019T20:28:14,ThingsAreMoving,I mean I don't know a whole lot about eyelashes or brows tbh
04-01-2019T20:28:41,ThingsAreMoving,I know that I pull some off involuntary every now and again.
04-01-2019T20:28:51,ThingsAreMoving,involuntarily* ?
04-01-2019T20:29:45,ThingsAreMoving,Wanna compare eyes? :ctwokinds-kingtea:
04-01-2019T20:29:50,SpazztasticKiwi,"I don’t mess with it too much. Gotten to where I don’t care to anymore. If people only notice me when I have makeup on, that’s just depressing"
04-01-2019T20:30:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Sure I’ll go get me collection display
04-01-2019T20:30:23,SpazztasticKiwi,my
04-01-2019T20:31:14,SpazztasticKiwi,But I don’t really share pictures at random online. Particularly of myself
04-01-2019T20:32:06,ThingsAreMoving,Same here. Don't divulge info that can be used to track you down.
04-01-2019T20:32:33,SpazztasticKiwi,I get enough creep without people knowing what I look like
04-01-2019T20:33:29,ThingsAreMoving,Working with people is the best way to get to that point.
04-01-2019T20:33:38,ThingsAreMoving,"Been there, done that."
04-01-2019T20:35:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Entirely too many “maybe I can sweet talk her into giving me something free” at work
04-01-2019T20:35:29,SpazztasticKiwi,"Or the stupidly common “smile, sweetheart”"
04-01-2019T20:35:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Say something funny and I might. Otherwise you’re just being disturbing
04-01-2019T20:36:08,ThingsAreMoving,"Hah. It's more of ""maybe he can do my work on top of his duties if I ask him really nice"" sort of thing."
04-01-2019T20:37:37,SpazztasticKiwi,We swap around tasks. But as for doing someone else’s work - I’ve taught at least one guy I wasn’t going to do that
04-01-2019T20:37:40,SpazztasticKiwi,He quit
04-01-2019T20:38:13,ThingsAreMoving,"I've been told that I should smile more, cause it makes me look better. In my previous workplace I had some beef with other employees and when I was leaving the manager told me thia I should consider what others think of me, cause that improves"
04-01-2019T20:38:31,ThingsAreMoving,the relationships within the workplace and by extension improces the workplace.
04-01-2019T20:39:58,ThingsAreMoving,"load of bs imho. especially that if you're successful, it tends to make other people envious."
04-01-2019T20:40:11,SpazztasticKiwi,I hear “smile” more than I care to and nothing makes me want to smile less
04-01-2019T20:40:57,SpazztasticKiwi,I will succeed by my skill - not by what others think of me
04-01-2019T20:40:59,ThingsAreMoving,"Was it you, who said she has a ""resting bitch face"" as default, or was ir Mippy, or Rima?"
04-01-2019T20:41:05,ThingsAreMoving,it*
04-01-2019T20:41:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I might have a small case of it. I’ve never seen my regular face
04-01-2019T20:42:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Mip or Rima though. I have been told I’m scary sometimes
04-01-2019T20:43:21,ThingsAreMoving,I've worked with girls that were considered the scary type. Turned out they were just tired of correcting other imbeciles that messed the easiest tasks.
04-01-2019T20:45:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I have patience. They’re just not infinite
04-01-2019T20:45:48,ThingsAreMoving,Every person I've worked with started with sort of 'trust credit'
04-01-2019T20:46:12,ThingsAreMoving,I I found out someone's an idiot I treated them as such
04-01-2019T20:46:18,ThingsAreMoving,if*
04-01-2019T20:46:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I did have one of our recent hires tell me she appreciated how patient and helpful I was with her
04-01-2019T20:47:10,SpazztasticKiwi,I can understand ignorance but I can’t stand someone who acts stupid
04-01-2019T20:47:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Like the dude I said quit? He started ok
04-01-2019T20:47:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Yes and no ma’am this and that
04-01-2019T20:47:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Asking questions and helping
04-01-2019T20:48:34,SpazztasticKiwi,But dude. He could not shut up. And he also didn’t know how to talk and work at the same time
04-01-2019T20:49:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Pretty soon we started having issues with him. When he’s just stand around or piddle
04-01-2019T20:49:14,SpazztasticKiwi,he’d
04-01-2019T20:49:35,ThingsAreMoving,"I have one of my countrymen at my workplace, he started alright, worked in a decent pace and all that. After some time he started taking more breaks than a 80yo granny. It's hard, cause we're supposed to help each other out in a foreign country"
04-01-2019T20:49:45,ThingsAreMoving,but his... attitude just pisses me off
04-01-2019T20:50:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m pretty convinced he had a truth problem too cause he claimed to have been struck by lightning 3 times
04-01-2019T20:50:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Have a masters in business
04-01-2019T20:50:33,ThingsAreMoving,Wut
04-01-2019T20:50:45,ThingsAreMoving,He should invest in some lottery tickets
04-01-2019T20:51:15,SpazztasticKiwi,"And we have at least three ages for him: 21, 22, & 23 that he told separate people"
04-01-2019T20:51:23,ThingsAreMoving,Masters degree.. is that a college degree or is it higher education?
04-01-2019T20:51:54,SpazztasticKiwi,I believe he was claiming it as the highest accomplishment
04-01-2019T20:52:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Which requires a few years in school to get so he was either able to graduate early or he was older than he claimed
04-01-2019T20:52:58,ThingsAreMoving,I'd say it was bs
04-01-2019T20:53:14,SpazztasticKiwi,The kicker was when he said he didn’t like to be in the freezers cause it was cold
04-01-2019T20:53:27,SpazztasticKiwi,So he wasn’t going to go in them
04-01-2019T20:53:47,SpazztasticKiwi,The job literally requires you to visit the freezer for food to cook
04-01-2019T20:53:58,ThingsAreMoving,I'd google some common problem from business class to know at least a little bit and ask him for the input on said problem
04-01-2019T20:54:11,SpazztasticKiwi,He he’s quit
04-01-2019T20:54:14,SpazztasticKiwi,oh
04-01-2019T20:54:39,SpazztasticKiwi,"The last night, he was set to close - 1-10pm shift"
04-01-2019T20:54:57,SpazztasticKiwi,I was only on the schedule with him till about 7/8
04-01-2019T20:56:15,SpazztasticKiwi,"The fryers get half shut down at 6:30. When I got back from lunch at 7 (when they’re supposed to be completely shut down/cleaned), he hadn’t touch em"
04-01-2019T20:56:45,SpazztasticKiwi,He told me “oh I thought you’d get em when you came back”
04-01-2019T20:57:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Uh. No. I’m not on to close - you are. I’m on the list to do the bread work
04-01-2019T20:57:53,SpazztasticKiwi,So I did bread work - basically forcing him to do the fryer alone. Late.
04-01-2019T20:58:27,ThingsAreMoving,"Well, speaking from experience it should be the manager's work to ensure that his work is done, not yours."
04-01-2019T20:58:45,ThingsAreMoving,So I'd just leave the fryers filthy and focus on my tasks.
04-01-2019T20:58:54,SpazztasticKiwi,"He knew better. And in the end, I left late, plenty was done for him before I was gone"
04-01-2019T20:59:35,SpazztasticKiwi,"Wrote him a list of what was done and not, descriptions with the tasks, and off I went"
04-01-2019T21:01:00,ThingsAreMoving,Were you paid extra for staying late and doing stuff that wasn't on your to-do list?
04-01-2019T21:01:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"I also sent said list to the manager. They talked to him in the morning how ridiculous it was that I stayed, did so much, and how he did just the rotisserie oven inside, fryers, and hot case while leaving the short simple list I left him unfinished"
04-01-2019T21:01:35,CrRAR,"yeah some managers pass the buck, let their shortcomings fall onto their employees lap AND take any subordinate's free time as a opportunity to shovel more responsibilities onto 'em."
04-01-2019T21:01:45,CrRAR,sucks
04-01-2019T21:01:55,SpazztasticKiwi,*not “in the morning”- the next time he came in
04-01-2019T21:01:59,ThingsAreMoving,Crarararara :ctwokinds-reniderp_flip:
04-01-2019T21:02:22,SpazztasticKiwi,He wasn’t a manager. He was the newest hire
04-01-2019T21:02:23,CrRAR,Then some even have the gall to drop blame/unforeseen stuff onto their employees
04-01-2019T21:02:27,CrRAR,ohh
04-01-2019T21:02:38,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-reniderp:
04-01-2019T21:02:47,CrRAR,elo things
04-01-2019T21:03:10,ThingsAreMoving,See when I was working on a petrol station waaaay back I was supposed to have 30 minutes brake when I was working my 12hr shifts
04-01-2019T21:03:24,ThingsAreMoving,guess how many times I've actually used the break time
04-01-2019T21:03:53,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s been times I had to take my break after my lunch and then not get my second
04-01-2019T21:03:57,SpazztasticKiwi,We get busy
04-01-2019T21:04:28,CrRAR,It sucks most when things feel thankless... and endless.
04-01-2019T21:05:13,SpazztasticKiwi,The people I work with are fine. It’s often the work and customers that’re the problem
04-01-2019T21:05:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Make you wanna year your hair out
04-01-2019T21:05:32,SpazztasticKiwi,tear
04-01-2019T21:06:06,ThingsAreMoving,"Yeeeeeeah... the ""I'm paying for it so I'm right"" attitude"
04-01-2019T21:06:25,SpazztasticKiwi,“I’d like a dozen hot wings - five legs and five drums”
04-01-2019T21:06:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Madam. Do you know how much a dozen is?
04-01-2019T21:06:48,ThingsAreMoving,"If someone's paying 1k+$ then yeah, but not if they're leaving like ~10$ for the stuff they buy"
04-01-2019T21:07:35,RimaDraws,I’m struggling with a sketch suggestion
04-01-2019T21:07:35,ThingsAreMoving,Should've ask the lady what to do with the remaining two
04-01-2019T21:07:48,ThingsAreMoving,that would confuse the eff sout of her
04-01-2019T21:07:52,ThingsAreMoving,out*
04-01-2019T21:07:57,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m gonna go 🛀
04-01-2019T21:08:04,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ll be bach
04-01-2019T21:08:17,ThingsAreMoving,Enjoy your music
04-01-2019T21:08:18,RimaDraws,Okay
04-01-2019T21:09:30,ThingsAreMoving,"What are you struggling with, Rima?"
04-01-2019T21:10:39,ThingsAreMoving,"Tricky pose, unfamiliar body shape, or maybe the background?"
04-01-2019T21:10:41,RimaDraws,Sketch suggestion idea
04-01-2019T21:11:19,RimaDraws,For tomorrow’s stream
04-01-2019T21:12:56,ThingsAreMoving,Hmm... what's so problematic with this particular suggestion?
04-01-2019T21:13:26,RimaDraws,I feel it’s boring just idk. I don’t normally struggle with stream ideas
04-01-2019T21:16:03,ThingsAreMoving,"If it feels boring just add some spikes, unicorns, weird non-euclidean shapes and such."
04-01-2019T21:17:19,RimaDraws,well..
04-01-2019T21:19:38,ThingsAreMoving,"I'm not an art expert, so I'm sorry if my answer isn't the most... helpful, but might give it a try and see what happens."
04-01-2019T21:20:46,SpazztasticKiwi,I can imagine Tom sitting there “a unicorn....”
04-01-2019T21:21:08,RimaDraws,i just dont want to run out of ideas...
04-01-2019T21:22:39,CrRAR,a unicorn... could fit in a Basitin Spice followup.
04-01-2019T21:22:43,CrRAR,shrugs
04-01-2019T21:22:47,ThingsAreMoving,"Well, sometimes ideas flood you and sometimes you need to look for inspiration in every place you canc think of."
04-01-2019T21:22:51,ThingsAreMoving,can*
04-01-2019T21:23:32,ThingsAreMoving,Never know when the spark of brilliance will strike you.
04-01-2019T21:24:50,ThingsAreMoving,"Btw I have a suggestion of Trace using the basitin Spice which turns him into an extra hot basitin. Might add a unicorn to the idea, now that I think about it."
04-01-2019T21:25:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Flora as fire and Trace as air
04-01-2019T21:25:34,ThingsAreMoving,Fire consumes air to thrive.
04-01-2019T21:25:44,ThingsAreMoving,"Not a happy ending, Kiwi."
04-01-2019T21:25:52,SpazztasticKiwi,She seems to like the taste of him
04-01-2019T21:25:59,RimaDraws,well thanks to my bf i got an idea
04-01-2019T21:26:11,ThingsAreMoving,Do tell
04-01-2019T21:26:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Air breathes life for fire. Fire moves air into motion
04-01-2019T21:26:19,RimaDraws,welll....
04-01-2019T21:26:30,ThingsAreMoving,Whisp if necessary
04-01-2019T21:26:46,RimaDraws,its got raine and rose in it so thats a start. i know what it will be.
04-01-2019T21:27:00,ThingsAreMoving,Sounds wholesome
04-01-2019T21:27:14,RimaDraws,something like bonding time or an outing
04-01-2019T21:27:44,RimaDraws,and sent in
04-01-2019T21:28:27,ThingsAreMoving,"That's somewhat abstract, Kiwi."
04-01-2019T21:28:42,ThingsAreMoving,At least for my sleep deprived mind.
04-01-2019T21:30:38,ThingsAreMoving,"I'm picturing Flora as a Djini made of fire, and Airy Trace fanning her with a palm leaf fan."
04-01-2019T21:30:41,RimaDraws,thanks for trying to help me things
04-01-2019T21:31:00,ThingsAreMoving,you're welcome

04-01-2019T22:24:46,SpazztasticKiwi,How do people write stories
04-01-2019T22:25:12,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve got about three or four scenes and no connection for one idea
04-01-2019T22:58:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom here?
04-01-2019T23:51:23,RimaDraws,i write
