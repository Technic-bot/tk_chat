10-04-2019T16:22:02,Azumachan,yeah
10-04-2019T16:27:31,Twokinds,"I wanted to put up the sketch poll early, so I had more time to go through them."
10-04-2019T16:27:59,Twokinds,"Oh hey Azuma, what do you think about the background of Trust me right now? It's still a WIP. It's been bugging me."
10-04-2019T16:29:13,Azumachan,"It's fine Tom, do what you feel is the best. I know you're busy so no need to overdo it."
10-04-2019T16:29:40,Azumachan,So far it's great ! Thank you.
10-04-2019T16:30:03,Twokinds,"Okay, thanks, I will continue along with it. As well as the other ones."
10-04-2019T16:30:11,iliar,"You talk about: Flora, Trust Me?"
10-04-2019T16:30:13,Twokinds,"Hopefully, I'll have everything caught up shortly."
10-04-2019T16:30:47,Azumachan,Don't overwork.
10-04-2019T16:30:57,Azumachan,Yep Iliar.
10-04-2019T16:31:08,iliar,I was wondering who Nora Carded it.
10-04-2019T16:31:38,Azumachan,I'm afraid I'm the one.
10-04-2019T16:36:38,Azumachan,How's going ?
10-04-2019T16:43:38,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:

10-04-2019T17:18:00,Bgrmystr2,I don't even know what image you guys are talkin about :u
10-04-2019T17:23:32,TerraTheWizard,i'm not entirely sure myself
10-04-2019T17:23:45,TerraTheWizard,and i can't look it up because patreon is down :V
10-04-2019T17:26:10,Xexanoth,just look it up on another site?
10-04-2019T17:26:28,Bgrmystr2,I did a search on amenon's site and deviantart but nothing came up
10-04-2019T17:26:29,Bgrmystr2,so.

10-04-2019T17:27:24,TerraTheWizard,was the one i was thinking of
10-04-2019T17:27:55,Bgrmystr2,"hm, why did DA not give that as a result"
10-04-2019T17:28:01,TerraTheWizard,no idea

10-04-2019T19:36:29,SpazztasticKiwi,I tried some swimsuits on today
10-04-2019T19:37:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I swear nothing has butt coverage anymore
10-04-2019T19:44:53,CrRAR,Flora is highly upset with butt coverage too.

10-04-2019T19:45:15,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-laugh:
10-04-2019T20:10:05,SpazztasticKiwi,At least she has fur
10-04-2019T20:10:22,SpazztasticKiwi,technically covered
10-04-2019T20:21:20,Bgrmystr2,"For flora, I bet a butt is a butt. Not that she cares, Keidran and all."
10-04-2019T20:21:41,Bgrmystr2,Who needs clothes anyway?
10-04-2019T21:56:12,SpazztasticKiwi,anyone aim to be at Momo coming up
10-04-2019T21:56:54,Bgrmystr2,"I know it's not here, so nope"
10-04-2019T22:01:04,SpazztasticKiwi,you know I wonder sometimes if I should wait posting anything here before thinking for at least 30 minutes. I googled conventions in Alabama and found one in gadston I may like
10-04-2019T22:01:54,SpazztasticKiwi,"cause that‚Äôs the thing - at this point I‚Äôm not as gung ho to go to Momo, I just want a convention vacation out of the house"
10-04-2019T22:02:50,Bgrmystr2,lolo
10-04-2019T22:03:40,Bgrmystr2,"well, if you want to go to a con, then the contents of the con matter. But if you're not meeting anyone in particular at a convention, then it shouldn't matter tooooo much which one you go to, besides the obvious indicators, content, size, distance, cost"
10-04-2019T22:03:40,Bgrmystr2,etc
10-04-2019T22:06:04,SpazztasticKiwi,I wasn‚Äôt shooting for anyone at Momo either. It‚Äôs got anime and comics and that general stuff
10-04-2019T23:27:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"Thinking on MM, it is really that hard spending a night with a gal friend"
