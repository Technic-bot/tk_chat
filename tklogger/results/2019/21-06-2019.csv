21-06-2019T01:38:02,BadFoMo,How so?
21-06-2019T01:39:04,BadFoMo,...Also; #ILLEGALAs****!
21-06-2019T01:39:07,Dadrobit,They did not in fact have a fire Marshall present for the show. That's not exactly legal. They convinced the club that it was fine because one of the technicians was an ex firefighter and that was a fine substitute.
21-06-2019T01:39:08,AspiringNoodle,"For example, what if everyone started buying RTX 2060's and NOTHING but 2060's until the price started inflating"

21-06-2019T01:41:04,AspiringNoodle,I like to think I do what Reni did in the comic :P
21-06-2019T01:41:08,AspiringNoodle,My innie became an outie xD
21-06-2019T01:41:17,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-ohmy:

21-06-2019T01:44:19,AspiringNoodle,Nvm
21-06-2019T01:44:52,Dadrobit,"Also, sage, I think I missed a reference? AZ police on a little girl and her mother?"
21-06-2019T01:46:01,SageSaga,O_O you didnt see that?
21-06-2019T01:46:24,Dadrobit,???
21-06-2019T01:46:49,SageSaga,uhhh- google it - Arizona Police 4 year old barbie doll
21-06-2019T01:47:05,SageSaga,and and be prepared to be angry
21-06-2019T01:47:20,Dadrobit,:/ I don't want to be angry tho. I like the police...
21-06-2019T01:47:25,Dadrobit,Brb
21-06-2019T01:47:32,SageSaga,then i shall sum up
21-06-2019T01:48:23,SageSaga,"they pulled their guns on a 4 year old and her mother over the little girl taking one of the dolls from the dollar store and the cops yelled stuff like ""IM GOING TO PUT A CAP IN YOUR HEAD!"""
21-06-2019T01:48:40,Bgrmystr2,excluding explicitives ^
21-06-2019T01:48:44,SageSaga,:P
21-06-2019T01:48:45,Dadrobit,Fucking goddamn it
21-06-2019T01:48:46,Bgrmystr2,because explicitives.
21-06-2019T01:48:48,SageSaga,yes- they cursed a lot
21-06-2019T01:48:51,sunblaze,jep read that even in germany.
21-06-2019T01:49:02,SageSaga,yo Sunblaze
21-06-2019T01:49:06,Dadrobit,Recent thing then huh?
21-06-2019T01:49:08,sunblaze,must have been a very dangeous 4 year old thief :ptv-unimpressed:
21-06-2019T01:49:15,Bgrmystr2,sec lemmy get the link for you dadro
21-06-2019T01:50:38,SageSaga,"ive got a cousin that is a police officer- nice guy, doesnt do that kinda stuff"
21-06-2019T01:51:28,SageSaga,considering the number of cops in that situation- i think there might be something wrong with a large number of their people
21-06-2019T01:52:32,Bgrmystr2,yeah it was really questionable sage
21-06-2019T01:52:56,RimaDraws,so i just now noticed qrow has a spot on his head where he is bleeding. i think he hit his head or scratched too hard
21-06-2019T01:56:58,SageSaga,ok- who is Qrow?
21-06-2019T01:57:17,SageSaga,I only know one Qrow...
21-06-2019T01:57:25,RimaDraws,my cat
21-06-2019T01:57:47,Bgrmystr2,"the dood from RWBY, obviously. Rima's cat was in the credits, didn't you see sage?"
21-06-2019T01:57:47,Bgrmystr2,:v
21-06-2019T01:57:48,SageSaga,now i know TWO QROWS
21-06-2019T01:57:54,RimaDraws,he has done something to make this one spot on his head bleed but its not bad.
21-06-2019T02:00:16,Dadrobit,Well fuck
21-06-2019T02:00:40,Dadrobit,That's a bummer way to ruin a night.
21-06-2019T02:00:47,RimaDraws,hm?
21-06-2019T02:00:54,Bgrmystr2,Sorry to down you Dadro :(
21-06-2019T02:00:59,RimaDraws,sorry
21-06-2019T02:01:00,Bgrmystr2,but yeah was a thing.
21-06-2019T02:01:11,Dadrobit,Was looking up stuff on this PHX PD issue.
21-06-2019T02:03:43,Dadrobit,Wish I could see what lead up to it though.
21-06-2019T02:04:33,SageSaga,im sure that 4 year old did something really offensive
21-06-2019T02:04:41,Dadrobit,"Obviously there was a hella bad overreaction,"
21-06-2019T02:05:40,SageSaga,She was probably wearing that Frog and Toad Shirt
21-06-2019T02:05:47,Dadrobit,But I'm curious about what lead them to even consider going that far?
21-06-2019T02:05:48,RimaDraws,lol
21-06-2019T02:06:36,SageSaga,NSFW language on the shirt-  also in the URL

21-06-2019T02:06:55,SageSaga,no time
21-06-2019T02:06:59,SageSaga,gotta work
21-06-2019T02:07:00,Bgrmystr2,lolo
21-06-2019T02:07:05,RimaDraws,oh my lord lol
21-06-2019T02:07:15,AspiringNoodle,"So random, love it~"
21-06-2019T02:08:13,SageSaga,the story behind it
21-06-2019T02:08:26,RimaDraws,nice shirt
21-06-2019T02:08:33,SageSaga,a woman bought that for her daughter but it didnt have that text on it on the picture from the store she bought it from online
21-06-2019T02:08:49,SageSaga,so it showed up and - tadah!
21-06-2019T02:09:29,SageSaga,here it is - https://amp.insider.com/images/5cf17bbb594ea515ed5c88f3-750-546.jpg
21-06-2019T02:11:08,RimaDraws,oh wow
21-06-2019T02:12:59,Dadrobit,That's some funny shit.
21-06-2019T02:13:39,Mihari,I wouldn't call it funny.
21-06-2019T02:13:51,Mihari,But I guess that's the parent in me.
21-06-2019T02:13:58,RimaDraws,its very provocative?
21-06-2019T02:14:15,RimaDraws,or ......vulgar
21-06-2019T02:14:21,SageSaga,it's not funny that she bought something with basically false advertising
21-06-2019T02:14:28,RimaDraws,no its not
21-06-2019T02:15:05,Dadrobit,"Okay, so evidently there is a tiny bit more to the story, the father had also stolen some underwear that he didtched out of the window when he saw the cops behind him. Also, he was driving on a suspended license. They were also with another woman who had"
21-06-2019T02:15:41,Dadrobit,Outstanding warrants and had previously evaded police by giving them false info.
21-06-2019T02:16:30,SageSaga,yeah none of that excuses what happened though
21-06-2019T02:17:45,Dadrobit,"They let the woman with the warrants out of the vehicle before the incident at the apartment complex so she could escape, but she was eventually tracked down and arrested as well."
21-06-2019T02:18:16,Dadrobit,"Yeah, still a super bad handling of the situation."
21-06-2019T02:22:15,SageSaga,"now if they had said ""The little girl was actually a little person wanted for murder"" i'd be a bit more forgiving..."
21-06-2019T02:25:02,Dadrobit,The little girl is for sure in a rough situation. She's gonna have a rough life if she isn't moved to a better situation after this or the parents start living more upstanding lives....
21-06-2019T02:26:12,SageSaga,well if the law suit goes through they will have a good life
21-06-2019T02:27:56,Dadrobit,"Maybe, maybe not. Could very well end up like most lotto winners where they're worse off after they run through their money. 10mil isn't a ton when you rack it all up on credit cards and then have to pay the interest."
21-06-2019T02:27:58,RimaDraws,i am all caught up again on AI
21-06-2019T02:28:12,SageSaga,congrats!
21-06-2019T02:28:39,RimaDraws,yeap uptodate
21-06-2019T02:28:51,Dadrobit,"Most is the wrong word, ""a large portion."""
21-06-2019T02:29:57,Dadrobit,"Wait, no, it is most. ""70% file for bankruptcy within 5 years."""
21-06-2019T02:30:16,AspiringNoodle,"I don't play the lottery anymore, lol"
21-06-2019T02:30:33,AspiringNoodle,"Instead, I take the money I *WOULD* spend on tickets and put it into a savings account specifically for computers :D"
21-06-2019T02:34:26,AspiringNoodle,"That said... if I did win the lottery, after paying off all the taxes, maybe I'd donate some amount to charity?  I'd then take some as pocket change, and invest the rest."
21-06-2019T02:34:52,AspiringNoodle,Then live off some portion of the ROI :P
21-06-2019T02:37:55,AspiringNoodle,"Man, this must be one difficult page."
21-06-2019T02:38:34,SageSaga,?

21-06-2019T14:14:13,Sclimshady,Vexento is all free on amazon prime if you have it
21-06-2019T14:15:46,Bgrmystr2,That requires paying Amazon though
21-06-2019T14:16:17,Bgrmystr2,And not getting an item.
21-06-2019T14:16:58,Sclimshady,"Yeah, but I ended up with 3000 dollars of music downloaded for 100 dollars a month, plus I buy a lot from them"
21-06-2019T14:17:38,Sclimshady,Year*
21-06-2019T14:17:47,Sclimshady,Whoops

21-06-2019T14:18:17,Bgrmystr2,Still wouldn't pay for it
21-06-2019T14:18:48,Bgrmystr2,"Is nice tho, friend has it."

21-06-2019T15:43:06,AspiringNoodle,Gives a few weeks time after the Zen 2  launches to see what boards / processors are best.
21-06-2019T15:43:52,AspiringNoodle,I only have 1 concern about the super cards
21-06-2019T15:44:08,AspiringNoodle,Can they play Space Invaders?!?:ptv-ohmy:
21-06-2019T15:49:55,AspiringNoodle,I wonder if people are going to switch to upgrading GPUs every 2 generations now.
21-06-2019T15:50:16,AspiringNoodle,At least until AMD offers cheaper alternatives
21-06-2019T15:51:16,Ordithus,how many generations old is an RX 480?
21-06-2019T15:52:07,AspiringNoodle,I think it's 3 at this point?
21-06-2019T15:53:39,Ordithus,Though I would need to upgrade a lot at the same time to make it worthwhile
21-06-2019T15:53:43,Ordithus,And that costs money
21-06-2019T16:00:00,RimaDraws,I’m back
21-06-2019T16:00:06,Ordithus,wb
21-06-2019T16:00:25,RimaDraws,Ty also looking good sage!

21-06-2019T16:13:27,AspiringNoodle,I can't stop staring at Oogie Boogie over there
21-06-2019T16:18:19,sunblaze,for some reason every time I look at that black/white haired catgirl I have to think of tharkis.
21-06-2019T16:18:43,sunblaze,woe me :ptv-condescending:
21-06-2019T16:18:52,Ordithus,She's a wolf girl though
21-06-2019T16:19:40,SageSaga,she is indeed a werewolf
21-06-2019T16:28:00,sunblaze,fair enough still to many headpats I guess
21-06-2019T16:41:04,SageSaga,had to make him pop out of the background more
21-06-2019T16:41:23,Ordithus,He's pretty sneaky
21-06-2019T16:41:57,SageSaga,alright folks! Im done!
21-06-2019T16:42:06,Ordithus,Nice!
21-06-2019T16:42:08,AspiringNoodle,"Awww, all good things must come to an end"
21-06-2019T16:42:24,SageSaga,hmm

21-06-2019T16:47:58,AspiringNoodle,"And too fucking bad, there's a reason it's called GPU Boost 3(THREE).0"
21-06-2019T16:48:10,AspiringNoodle,"Dammit, this always happens eventually! xD"
21-06-2019T17:12:27,AspiringNoodle,"""I can go into bigger big dick mode than you, though."""

21-06-2019T17:13:08,AspiringNoodle,It's more hilarious when you have no context
21-06-2019T17:37:47,Nekonny,o/

21-06-2019T17:46:49,AspiringNoodle,*imagines story that is nothing but cliffhangers*
21-06-2019T17:47:00,Tharkis,depends on my progress for my anthrocon project
21-06-2019T17:47:15,Sclimshady,You peak our interest then wait to say what we should be knowing about
21-06-2019T17:47:16,Nekonny,project?
21-06-2019T17:48:23,Tharkis,i havent been making many knives lately but i used to use the scrap wood from my knives to make nice pens and pencils.  I went out and got the components i need to make a batch of nice hand turned mechanical pencils and twist pens to exchange with artists
21-06-2019T17:48:27,Tharkis,for doodles in my sketchbook
21-06-2019T17:49:19,AspiringNoodle,I swear to whatever deity there is
21-06-2019T17:49:34,AspiringNoodle,"I will get the power to fight anything I desire, so I may slay the dreaded buffering wheel"
21-06-2019T17:49:37,AspiringNoodle,NO BUFFERING
21-06-2019T17:49:37,AspiringNoodle,EVER
21-06-2019T17:50:06,Tharkis,"about $15 to $20 in material per pen/pencil.  I forget how much they cost to make when i'm making one or two at a time, but this morning i picked up the internals and wood to make 20 of them + a new hand press for assembly , bam, $400 bill at the register"
21-06-2019T17:50:37,Nekonny,ohhhhhhhhhhh
21-06-2019T17:51:43,AspiringNoodle,My wallet... it hurts ;_;
21-06-2019T17:52:22,Nekonny,now that is quite a prize though!
21-06-2019T17:53:10,Tharkis,trying to decide if people would like the fiddle-toy pens that i make or if they'd get annoying to people who actually use them a lot for drawing =P
21-06-2019T17:53:18,Tharkis,they're fun to make though with captured hoops on them
21-06-2019T17:53:31,Tharkis,http://www.tharkis.com/images/temp/ringpens.jpg
21-06-2019T17:53:33,Nekonny,you have a pic?

21-06-2019T17:53:54,Tharkis,"can only do that with pens though, not pencils"

21-06-2019T19:00:25,AspiringNoodle,"Tharkis, does the castle have blackjack and hookers?"
21-06-2019T19:01:12,Tharkis,"a society of catgirls doesnt need those, too much work"

21-06-2019T19:09:44,AspiringNoodle,all you're doing is convincing me that the catgirl strippers should wear nothing but fur and leather :P
21-06-2019T19:10:29,AspiringNoodle,Anything else would look unnatural in such an untouched paradise~\
21-06-2019T19:11:05,AspiringNoodle,"Sclim, who's bringing the catgirls?"
21-06-2019T19:11:34,Sclimshady,I can wrastle up a few

21-06-2019T19:16:55,Tharkis,make sure you dont spend too much time on background stuff where text is going to sit lol
21-06-2019T19:18:21,Tharkis,hopefully lots of badass cut and paste makes the assets reusable like that =D
21-06-2019T19:18:52,AspiringNoodle,Is it weird if you offer yourself to potentially become a catgirl if it means getting more catgirls? xD
21-06-2019T19:19:07,AspiringNoodle,Or are the catgirls worth it? :ptv-hearts:
21-06-2019T19:19:25,Tharkis,this is a whole comic about tharkis turning into a catgirl :ctharkis-uneasy:

21-06-2019T19:59:37,Tharkis,my computer is almost 10 years old and it handles like 8 streams at once
21-06-2019T19:59:47,Tharkis,something's eating all your memory if it cant =D

21-06-2019T20:03:43,AspiringNoodle,"Okay, now audio's going through, but the screen is static?"
21-06-2019T20:04:52,Tharkis,it's not your computer it's nekonny's broadcast that's causing buffer with OBS
21-06-2019T20:05:42,AspiringNoodle,"I should mention that my computer is HORRIBLY mismatched, lmao"
21-06-2019T20:07:00,Nekonny,again?
