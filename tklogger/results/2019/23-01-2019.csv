23-01-2019T16:30:55,Bgrmystr2,I should. To keep my schedule. But technically no I have nothing planned

23-01-2019T16:41:18,Bgrmystr2,I'm gonna just sit here. :u
23-01-2019T16:42:06,ThingsAreMoving,get on youtube and watch something you enjoy. I find it's one of the best ways to jumpstart my brain in the mornings.
23-01-2019T16:42:14,Bgrmystr2,thaaat's what I'm doin
23-01-2019T16:42:54,ThingsAreMoving,Good man. I've just finished work and am currently waiting until my dumplings are boiled through.
23-01-2019T16:43:16,ThingsAreMoving,Need some noms.

23-01-2019T16:52:47,ThingsAreMoving,I have the yum yums.
23-01-2019T16:54:54,Mippy,My lunch was a cookie and a small tea. :ctwokinds-sadtrace2: Good thing I work today and can grab a free burger
23-01-2019T16:55:42,ThingsAreMoving,:hamburger:
23-01-2019T16:55:56,ThingsAreMoving,what kind of burger are you getting?
23-01-2019T17:00:18,Mippy,I’ll know why I have to choose. Probably a couple of the limited time sliders we have and some onion rings or something
23-01-2019T17:00:29,Mippy,*when
23-01-2019T17:04:04,ThingsAreMoving,Enjoy your free burger once you get it then. I'd go for a nice cheeseburger with bacon and whiskey-bbq sauce mix
23-01-2019T17:04:59,Mippy,Yeah....except we are fast food and don’t have whisky BBQ :ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
23-01-2019T17:05:25,Mippy,You can haz cheese burger though
23-01-2019T17:06:06,ThingsAreMoving,but... what about some bacon at least?
23-01-2019T17:06:24,Mippy,"Yes, you can haz bacon"
23-01-2019T17:06:32,Mippy,:ctwokinds-rainehappy:
23-01-2019T17:06:53,ThingsAreMoving,If I can haz cheezburger with bacon then I'm content.

23-01-2019T17:07:34,ThingsAreMoving,"Is that fast food shop some kind of KFC, wendy's or other mcdonald's kind of thing?"
23-01-2019T17:07:45,ThingsAreMoving,Or is it something local?
23-01-2019T17:07:53,Mippy,"Gotta go get the bus. If Tom shows up, tell homeboy I said “hello”"
23-01-2019T17:08:10,ThingsAreMoving,"will do, take care"
23-01-2019T17:08:29,Mippy,It’s and A&W so it’s country wide. I do hear you have them in the States but the menu is different

23-01-2019T18:03:08,Bgrmystr2,do you recall where the or whateverᵀᴹ began?
23-01-2019T18:03:28,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: I'm not even sure if Things was around back then
23-01-2019T18:03:31,Bgrmystr2,I think Ord was
23-01-2019T18:03:44,Bgrmystr2,but he's not here atm
23-01-2019T18:07:07,TerraTheWizard,"i think so, gimme 5 mins"

23-01-2019T18:11:15,TerraTheWizard,pretty sure it was this
23-01-2019T18:11:38,TerraTheWizard,like 70% sure
23-01-2019T18:11:56,Bgrmystr2,xD
23-01-2019T18:13:09,TerraTheWizard,"this is before the patreon started, which is where i think all the other ""_ or whatever"" things came from"
23-01-2019T18:13:47,TerraTheWizard,"unless i missed one, which does happen because this is memory vs me scrolling dA"
23-01-2019T18:13:48,TerraTheWizard,lol
23-01-2019T18:16:22,ThingsAreMoving,I forgot that piece even existed.
23-01-2019T18:16:37,ThingsAreMoving,And it's way before I got here.
23-01-2019T18:16:38,Bgrmystr2,yeah that was when he was streaming but I don't think he started the patreon page yet..
23-01-2019T18:16:41,Bgrmystr2,that was such a long time ago
23-01-2019T18:16:42,Bgrmystr2,haha
23-01-2019T18:16:45,Bgrmystr2,I thought so
23-01-2019T18:17:16,ThingsAreMoving,I came here after the... noodle shenanigans.
23-01-2019T18:17:24,ThingsAreMoving,You know what I'm talking about.
23-01-2019T18:18:25,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-ohmy:
23-01-2019T18:18:27,Bgrmystr2,yes I do
23-01-2019T18:18:36,Bgrmystr2,"dangerous, that one."
23-01-2019T18:18:56,ThingsAreMoving,"Do you still have that story? I think I'd like to read it again, lol."
23-01-2019T18:19:03,Bgrmystr2,A both figerative and literal noodle incident.
23-01-2019T18:19:29,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
23-01-2019T18:19:55,TerraTheWizard,the what now?
23-01-2019T18:20:57,Bgrmystr2,The story of Shenanigans.. A long LONG time ago in a chat not too far away from here.. https://pastebin.com/Yxx2zS6A
23-01-2019T18:22:52,TerraTheWizard,well that's a thing
23-01-2019T18:22:53,TerraTheWizard,lol
23-01-2019T18:23:12,ThingsAreMoving,I'd love to be there when it happened.
23-01-2019T18:23:23,TerraTheWizard,that was from the between times for me
23-01-2019T18:23:48,TerraTheWizard,"i didn't know tom streamed on picarto or had a patreon for aaages, like mid 2017"
23-01-2019T18:23:56,ThingsAreMoving,It was a whole year before I've subscribed.
23-01-2019T18:24:07,ThingsAreMoving,september 2017 for me
23-01-2019T18:24:11,TerraTheWizard,i watched his streams back on livestream/ustream back in like 2013
23-01-2019T18:24:42,TerraTheWizard,they suddenly stopped one day & i thought he'd just given up streaming
23-01-2019T18:24:51,TerraTheWizard,because the forum still links the ustream account...
23-01-2019T18:25:04,Bgrmystr2,It had happened about a week prior to my posting it
23-01-2019T18:25:31,Bgrmystr2,"cuz I have a chat on discord created from it on Sept 25th, that sunday"
23-01-2019T18:25:49,TerraTheWizard,"then while i was depressed in uni browsing reddit, i stumbled upon the tk subreddit"
23-01-2019T18:25:54,TerraTheWizard,found the discord link
23-01-2019T18:26:01,Bgrmystr2,so it likely happened on the 23rd of that sept on the friday stream
23-01-2019T18:26:02,TerraTheWizard,then about 3 weeks later found out about the streams
23-01-2019T18:26:06,TerraTheWizard,& the patreon
23-01-2019T18:26:37,Bgrmystr2,I believe fluff was actually multi-streaming that day
23-01-2019T18:26:54,Bgrmystr2,with sage and tom that friday
23-01-2019T18:27:28,Bgrmystr2,I'm not 100% sure though
23-01-2019T18:28:12,ThingsAreMoving,I wonder if Illiar has that stream archived on his youtube.
23-01-2019T18:28:16,Bgrmystr2,"but several of the people who were actually there are, or at least were a part of fluff's chat denizens"
23-01-2019T18:28:18,Bgrmystr2,naw
23-01-2019T18:28:24,Bgrmystr2,that was before Iliar was recording streams
23-01-2019T18:28:30,ThingsAreMoving,aw
23-01-2019T18:28:37,Bgrmystr2,Fomo probably has it though.. I know he records the streams
23-01-2019T18:28:42,Bgrmystr2,but I don't know if he has the chat recorded
23-01-2019T18:29:05,Bgrmystr2,and I don't know if tom had the chat shown in the stream back then.
23-01-2019T18:29:15,Bgrmystr2,2016 was a long time ago xD
23-01-2019T18:29:32,Bgrmystr2,Some of the people there are still here..
23-01-2019T18:29:53,ThingsAreMoving,The veterans
23-01-2019T18:29:57,Bgrmystr2,indeed
23-01-2019T18:30:12,Bgrmystr2,"neon, phoenix, combak of note"
23-01-2019T18:30:18,Bgrmystr2,CrRAR as well
23-01-2019T18:30:52,Bgrmystr2,a few others I can't recall
23-01-2019T18:31:05,ThingsAreMoving,"FoMo, I'd assume"
23-01-2019T18:31:16,Bgrmystr2,probably
23-01-2019T18:32:22,ThingsAreMoving,"Days far gone, when Tom had less than 1000 followers here."
23-01-2019T18:32:33,ThingsAreMoving,"And lookit now, almost 7k"
23-01-2019T18:32:41,Bgrmystr2,yeah quite a while ago now..
23-01-2019T18:32:53,Bgrmystr2,so much changed since then. 99% I'd say for the better.
23-01-2019T18:34:26,ThingsAreMoving,is that 1% unfteddy getting a mod? :ctwokinds-keith8D:
23-01-2019T18:34:39,ThingsAreMoving,lol
23-01-2019T18:34:47,Bgrmystr2,"oh, no"
23-01-2019T18:34:49,Bgrmystr2,haha
23-01-2019T18:34:58,Bgrmystr2,I was just thinking that not everything is perfect since then.
23-01-2019T18:35:10,Bgrmystr2,it's just a small catch-all for stuff that went badly
23-01-2019T18:35:14,ThingsAreMoving,"perfect is boring, tbh"
23-01-2019T18:35:19,Bgrmystr2,of course it is
23-01-2019T18:35:23,ThingsAreMoving,gotta have some drama every now and again
23-01-2019T18:35:31,Bgrmystr2,but things like patreon being a prude
23-01-2019T18:35:32,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-clovisgirl_shake:
23-01-2019T18:35:52,Bgrmystr2,Patreon's knee-jerk was unnecessary
23-01-2019T18:36:14,Bgrmystr2,stuff like that is the 1%
23-01-2019T18:36:25,ThingsAreMoving,"It was, but I think it was aimed at more serious matters than lewd-ish drawings"
23-01-2019T18:36:42,ThingsAreMoving,and it sorta extended to them
23-01-2019T18:36:52,Bgrmystr2,yeah but they used that to abuse that power against artists instead of drawing a line
23-01-2019T18:37:25,ThingsAreMoving,"yup, in the end it's their platform and they make the rules."
23-01-2019T18:37:38,ThingsAreMoving,no matter if they're fair or not
23-01-2019T18:38:06,Bgrmystr2,"unfortunately, they shouldn't have the power to tell people how to run their businesses, they're just a middleman."
23-01-2019T18:38:19,Bgrmystr2,"also, I don't consider phoenix getting mod as 1%"
23-01-2019T18:38:28,Bgrmystr2,because that was definitely necessary at the time
23-01-2019T18:38:44,Bgrmystr2,and so far has come in handy several times
23-01-2019T18:39:21,Bgrmystr2,Ord and Phoenix were absolutely the heros that day
23-01-2019T18:39:39,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
23-01-2019T18:39:43,ThingsAreMoving,they were
23-01-2019T18:40:17,Bgrmystr2,"a well-known troublemaker came in spamming garabage in the chat, terra"
23-01-2019T18:40:21,Bgrmystr2,and they shut it down
23-01-2019T18:40:21,TerraTheWizard,ah
23-01-2019T18:40:31,Bgrmystr2,"removed the messages, banned the guy's multiple accounts"
23-01-2019T18:40:48,ThingsAreMoving,and banned Neon
23-01-2019T18:40:50,ThingsAreMoving,xD
23-01-2019T18:41:03,Bgrmystr2,"cuz it was happening every min or two, he'd go and get a new acct.. and tom had to stop everything he was doing for the stream to fix it.."
23-01-2019T18:41:16,Bgrmystr2,but yeah NOONE that was banned did not deserve to get banned.
23-01-2019T18:41:17,Bgrmystr2,Noone.
23-01-2019T18:41:22,Bgrmystr2,And I will stand by that.
23-01-2019T18:41:31,ThingsAreMoving,"Well we did post that pasta, so I guess"
23-01-2019T18:41:52,ThingsAreMoving,And it was more like a time-out for him
23-01-2019T18:41:55,Bgrmystr2,"Neon reposted the pasta, and got smacked by the hammer. He knew better."
23-01-2019T18:41:59,Bgrmystr2,it wasn't perma.
23-01-2019T18:42:08,Bgrmystr2,but he absolutely deserved it.
23-01-2019T18:42:09,ThingsAreMoving,but it still was hilarious
23-01-2019T18:42:27,Bgrmystr2,"yes, and it was funny to boot."
23-01-2019T18:42:45,Bgrmystr2,"Ord unbanned him, unfortunately."
23-01-2019T18:43:03,Bgrmystr2,:v
23-01-2019T18:43:29,ThingsAreMoving,I thought it was phoenix who lifted the ban after some time
23-01-2019T18:43:32,ThingsAreMoving,huh
23-01-2019T18:43:34,Bgrmystr2,naw
23-01-2019T18:43:41,Bgrmystr2,it was Ord.
23-01-2019T18:43:53,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah ord was the one that made that mistake
23-01-2019T18:43:57,ThingsAreMoving,lol
23-01-2019T18:43:59,unsteddyphoenix,But I forgave him :)
23-01-2019T18:44:01,ThingsAreMoving,hi kiwibro
23-01-2019T18:44:06,Bgrmystr2,ay phoenix

23-01-2019T18:49:35,Bgrmystr2,and the source of it that terra sent is not really that great

23-01-2019T20:25:16,RimaDraws,where!?
23-01-2019T20:32:16,SpazztasticKiwi,I split my nail
23-01-2019T20:44:52,Bgrmystr2,D;
23-01-2019T20:44:55,Bgrmystr2,that's horrible
23-01-2019T20:45:04,Bgrmystr2,I hate doing that
23-01-2019T20:45:09,Bgrmystr2,hurts like a fuck
23-01-2019T21:08:53,RimaDraws,ouch....
23-01-2019T21:34:37,Dadrobit,So I'm looking to get in with an official studio as an engineer and am getting in contact with some of my old professors to see if they won't endorse me.
23-01-2019T21:35:01,Dadrobit,One of them is being very supportive lol

23-01-2019T21:35:44,Bgrmystr2,"to be fair, those donuts are fuckin amazing :ptv-hearts:"
23-01-2019T21:48:20,SpazztasticKiwi,I wonder if it’s gonna grow back ok
23-01-2019T21:49:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Looks sorta like your thumb did
23-01-2019T21:50:29,Bgrmystr2,it should be fine
23-01-2019T21:50:39,Bgrmystr2,just depends on how badly it's split
23-01-2019T21:50:51,Bgrmystr2,"I've split my nails before, but they grow back like normal"
23-01-2019T21:51:10,Bgrmystr2,"unless it was serious damage, then y'know, ya can't win em all. :/"
23-01-2019T21:52:08,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s a crack from a little off the middle to the side. But it’s all on the nail bed
23-01-2019T21:53:10,SpazztasticKiwi,None of it’s detached or cracking off. It’s just like a fault line fissure
23-01-2019T21:53:49,SpazztasticKiwi,I sent a shot on discord
23-01-2019T22:32:17,Bgrmystr2,"back, and eeee... that's ow"
23-01-2019T22:32:29,Bgrmystr2,does it hurt?
23-01-2019T22:33:18,Bgrmystr2,"also, that should probably grow out eventually"
23-01-2019T22:33:52,Bgrmystr2,the nail will just keep growin outwards and that split will just eventually reach the end of your nail and you can cut it off :u
23-01-2019T22:36:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Doesn’t hurt too much. If I hadn’t seen blood I wouldn’t felt it as much as I do
23-01-2019T22:40:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"Tender, really. My fingers don’t have a ton of sensitivity. A small bit chipped off the top. But it’s holding in - no wiggles or anything"
23-01-2019T22:40:34,Bgrmystr2,alright
23-01-2019T22:40:57,Bgrmystr2,well just don't poke it or anything cuz it can get more sensitive if you mess with it
23-01-2019T22:41:14,Bgrmystr2,looong history of problems with nails and toes xD
23-01-2019T22:42:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I had an ingrown toenail for the longest time till I sorted it out
23-01-2019T22:42:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Part of the nail bed seems to have died but whatcanyado
23-01-2019T22:42:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Also scraped my pinky the other day. No idea how I did it. Just noticed the blood after and I still not sure how I did it
23-01-2019T22:42:57,Bgrmystr2,I had to get both sides of both my big toe nail beds burned so they wouldn't give me ingrown nails. :u
23-01-2019T22:43:53,Bgrmystr2,"my big toenails are just thin now compared to before. was fuckin horrible, tell you what. :/"
23-01-2019T22:45:48,SpazztasticKiwi,I had a teacher who had a toenail removed
23-01-2019T22:46:22,SpazztasticKiwi,She went to the salon to have a fake put on
23-01-2019T22:50:36,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-kingtea:
23-01-2019T22:54:14,Bgrmystr2,Hey Ord :D
23-01-2019T22:57:48,Ordithus,Hi Bgr!
23-01-2019T23:07:14,Bgrmystr2,how you doin
23-01-2019T23:09:44,Ordithus,"Doing good.  Replaced my thermostat, feeling good about that."
23-01-2019T23:09:45,Ordithus,You?
23-01-2019T23:10:04,Bgrmystr2,found out the guy I live with has a bad hard drive.. the power connection is failing on it. :/
23-01-2019T23:10:45,Bgrmystr2,and still trying to diagnose friend's issue with bluescreens on brand new hardware
23-01-2019T23:13:29,Ordithus,Somehow I've never had issues with new hardware
23-01-2019T23:13:33,Ordithus,Works right away
23-01-2019T23:13:49,Ordithus,"I know that's the risky stage, though"
23-01-2019T23:14:10,Bgrmystr2,I have many times
23-01-2019T23:14:27,Bgrmystr2,Wouldn't recommend.
23-01-2019T23:15:56,Ordithus,"Hardware failures on old equipment, though"
23-01-2019T23:15:59,Ordithus,That I've had
23-01-2019T23:16:55,Bgrmystr2,yeah know that feel.. literally his drive right now
23-01-2019T23:17:01,Bgrmystr2,it's one of the ones from the school
23-01-2019T23:17:20,Bgrmystr2,so instead of having read/write or spindle movement errors..
23-01-2019T23:17:25,Bgrmystr2,it has power errors.
23-01-2019T23:17:51,Bgrmystr2,because all they did is just turn it on and off like 170 fucking thousand times over the course of a few years.
23-01-2019T23:18:30,Ordithus,What why?
23-01-2019T23:18:47,Bgrmystr2,because it's a school computer for an elementary school.
23-01-2019T23:19:28,Bgrmystr2,"all they do is turn it on, it boots, they do something with it for like 30 mins, then turn it right back off.. and it sits there for 3 hours and then they turn it back on"
23-01-2019T23:19:30,Bgrmystr2,ad infinium
23-01-2019T23:19:33,Bgrmystr2,till the end of the day.
23-01-2019T23:19:46,TorqueEmUp,"My father has an old computer from 2003ish, with a 120GB Samsung HDD in it, that computer still functions to this day, and I guarantee the power on of that computer has to have a uptime measured in years."
23-01-2019T23:20:27,TorqueEmUp,And butchered that
23-01-2019T23:20:47,Bgrmystr2,right now.. I have my vista from 2010
23-01-2019T23:20:48,TorqueEmUp,"What I MEANT to say was, that computer uptime has to me measure in years, not hours. lol"
23-01-2019T23:21:01,Bgrmystr2,"or so.. and it has 95,000 power-on hours."
23-01-2019T23:21:06,TorqueEmUp,fucking hell I can't type on Picarto
23-01-2019T23:21:07,Bgrmystr2,but it already restarted from zero
23-01-2019T23:21:51,TorqueEmUp,Yeah I would doubt that's probably how my father's HP desktop is in that ballpark.
23-01-2019T23:22:01,TorqueEmUp,wouldn't*
23-01-2019T23:22:24,TorqueEmUp,"Ughh, I cannot brain tonight it seems."
23-01-2019T23:22:27,Bgrmystr2,"my vista, as it currently reads, has seen 3,958 days, or 10.8 years. Actually, that's pretty accurate. Huh. Maybe this isn't the one that reset. :thinking:"
23-01-2019T23:23:17,Bgrmystr2,"it had to have been 2010, so how did it get 10.8 years of power on hours I don't know"
23-01-2019T23:23:31,Bgrmystr2,it's not been 10 years since I got it yet. xD
23-01-2019T23:23:53,Bgrmystr2,only turned it on 504 times haha
23-01-2019T23:24:00,TorqueEmUp,who knows
23-01-2019T23:24:03,TorqueEmUp,lol
23-01-2019T23:24:29,TorqueEmUp,"Yeah, pretty much all original components too in my father's HP."
23-01-2019T23:25:06,Bgrmystr2,for a drive that's only been turned on 500 times and reports 11 years of use within the almost 10 years I've had it.. it only has 27 reallocated sectors.
23-01-2019T23:25:11,Bgrmystr2,That thing's a fuckin trooper man
23-01-2019T23:25:13,TorqueEmUp,I think I replaced a fan inside the powersupply (Yes I took it apart and soldered a new one in) and of course thermal paste on the CPU.
23-01-2019T23:25:37,TorqueEmUp,"Well I don't think I know, but I might have also replaced a CPU fan."
23-01-2019T23:25:46,Bgrmystr2,lol replaced the PSU fan eh
23-01-2019T23:25:59,TorqueEmUp,"Yep, that was like 10 years ago though"
23-01-2019T23:26:02,Bgrmystr2,"I'd just replace the PSU myself, I don't like to mess with those on the inside."
23-01-2019T23:26:04,TorqueEmUp,because it was noisy AF
23-01-2019T23:26:22,Bgrmystr2,also I don't have knowledge of soldering
23-01-2019T23:26:33,TorqueEmUp,"actually like 11 years ago, I was still in high school."
23-01-2019T23:27:34,TorqueEmUp,"I just replaced the fan, because my I found a similar sized fan that I salvaged from something else."
23-01-2019T23:27:53,TorqueEmUp,and I was big into soldering and stuff at the time.
23-01-2019T23:29:12,TorqueEmUp,"But yeah, that HP was high quality stuff to last that long, and still is kicking to this day, even though I built my father an i7 rig a couple years ago."
23-01-2019T23:29:48,TorqueEmUp,"He still insists on using the HP for some stuff, because the software he likes to use doesn't work with Windows 10."
23-01-2019T23:30:34,TorqueEmUp,"And you know how father's get when they get old. They want to keep using what they know, and not figure out new fangled stuff."
23-01-2019T23:30:36,Bgrmystr2,I miss when hardware was made to last.. nowadays they make them purposely to fail within a few years just so ppl are forced to buy a new one.. lookin at you apple. :ptv-pouty:
23-01-2019T23:31:17,TorqueEmUp,"fathers* dunno why I put a "" ' "" in there"
23-01-2019T23:31:28,Bgrmystr2,"honestly, the reluctance to switch to windows 10 is understandable"
23-01-2019T23:31:38,Bgrmystr2,Your dad is very different from mine honestly
23-01-2019T23:31:49,Bgrmystr2,he's the one I go to if I just cannot figure out what to do with a computer issue xD
23-01-2019T23:31:53,TorqueEmUp,"Well he literally jumped from XP to Windows 10, so a HUGE jump. XD"
23-01-2019T23:32:06,Bgrmystr2,ew no
23-01-2019T23:32:09,Bgrmystr2,xD
23-01-2019T23:32:23,Bgrmystr2,I'd rather just switch to 7
23-01-2019T23:32:58,Bgrmystr2,"in fact, my friend's new system, we've got him running windows 10 to confirm his hardware isn't bad, and we're gonna install windows 7 on a virtual machine so he can run all his original shit on there without worrying about the system failing."
23-01-2019T23:33:00,TorqueEmUp,"My dad was a police officer, didn't buy his first computer until like 1996ish"
23-01-2019T23:33:39,TorqueEmUp,So not the most tech savvy person.
23-01-2019T23:33:45,Ordithus,Most folks didn't really have much use for one until around then
23-01-2019T23:33:47,Bgrmystr2,:/
23-01-2019T23:34:28,TorqueEmUp,"He's only had 4 computers total, including the new one I built for him."
23-01-2019T23:34:35,Ordithus,"We got our first computer a few years before then, but that was so my dad could take his accounting work home"
23-01-2019T23:34:48,Ordithus,Us kids played games on that ol MSDOS machine
23-01-2019T23:35:49,TorqueEmUp,"First one was a Pentium MMX Packard Bell, After that was a Pentium 3 Dell Dimension (When Dell still used beige plastic cases) and then the Pentium 4 with Hyperthreading HP."
23-01-2019T23:39:03,TorqueEmUp,"I remember though back before we got a broadband connection, we had a second phone line installed just for Dial-up."
23-01-2019T23:41:47,Ordithus,Same
23-01-2019T23:42:56,Ordithus,I first experienced real broadband when I went to college back in 06
23-01-2019T23:43:12,Ordithus,"I suppose the high school had decent internet, though :thinking:"
23-01-2019T23:44:25,TorqueEmUp,I high school from in the late 00s still had computer in classrooms with Windows 98 SE on them.
23-01-2019T23:45:19,TorqueEmUp,Yep still can't brain tonight
