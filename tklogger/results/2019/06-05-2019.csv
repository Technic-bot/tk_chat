06-05-2019T00:05:38,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m settling for bed I guess  got a trip

06-05-2019T01:09:58,SpazztasticKiwi,You go find her. Have that adventure
06-05-2019T01:10:08,SpazztasticKiwi,🛌

06-05-2019T07:59:42,SpazztasticKiwi,5 more and I’m done with ancient bride
06-05-2019T08:34:07,TerraTheWizard,power was off from 9am to 2pm (it's 2:33 now)
06-05-2019T08:34:19,TerraTheWizard,was only supposed to be off an hour or two
06-05-2019T08:41:58,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-flomad:
06-05-2019T08:43:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Don’t you know “we’ll get it back in no time” means “ get used to the dark ages”?
06-05-2019T08:45:56,TerraTheWizard,well it was the plumber fitting the new shower
06-05-2019T08:46:09,TerraTheWizard,but as is usual with this house everything is in old building standards
06-05-2019T08:46:16,TerraTheWizard,so none of the new stuff fits properly
06-05-2019T08:57:50,TeapotOfDoom,Best thing were the really old cables which houses were retrofit with once the electrification started. They were straight up nailed to the wall.
06-05-2019T08:58:04,TeapotOfDoom,"If the electrition missed by a few millimeters, you were either dead if you touched the nail or had a burning house on your hands."
06-05-2019T08:58:17,TeapotOfDoom,Best invention ever
06-05-2019T08:58:29,TeapotOfDoom,Btw Hi there!
06-05-2019T09:01:08,TerraTheWizard,o/
06-05-2019T09:37:47,SpazztasticKiwi,I sometimes wonder if I ever really learned how to sit normally. I never seem to
06-05-2019T10:40:22,TeapotOfDoom,I don't think you're the only one

06-05-2019T11:10:56,iliar,I do not know how to react to this sketch. It is very emotional. But this is not what I want to look at.
06-05-2019T11:11:40,iliar,"And yes, I would like to see this Saria's portrait separately."
06-05-2019T11:13:10,CuTeWoLf,hi iliar
06-05-2019T11:13:18,iliar,Hi
06-05-2019T11:18:27,Azumachan,:ctwokinds-florajiggle:
06-05-2019T11:19:58,iliar,I was thinking about how to use this empty space in the color version (if I decide Nora Card this sketch). I think solid color is not good.
06-05-2019T11:20:06,iliar,It seems to me a big hall would reinforce the impression.
06-05-2019T11:26:50,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-LauraCry:
06-05-2019T11:36:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Lord. Did they lock her in a white rubber room for an eternal time out
06-05-2019T11:41:27,CrimsonQuill,Good evening all
06-05-2019T11:44:47,CrimsonQuill,I have seen the upload.
06-05-2019T11:45:06,CrimsonQuill,The emotions hit hard on this one.
06-05-2019T13:22:07,CrimsonQuill,Anyone here?
06-05-2019T13:45:29,TerraTheWizard,nope
06-05-2019T13:45:38,CrimsonQuill,Bother.
06-05-2019T14:23:48,Orthonox,A wave of melancholy hit me when seeing that sketch. Did anyone look at the portrait Rose was holding up close?
06-05-2019T14:24:03,CrimsonQuill,Yes.
06-05-2019T14:24:10,CrimsonQuill,And what was written on it.
06-05-2019T14:24:18,CrimsonQuill,Imagine the pain she must be going through...
06-05-2019T14:29:44,Orthonox,I do not know if Rose has any friends outside of Saria to support her in her darkest moments.
06-05-2019T14:30:43,CrimsonQuill,Perhaps not....
06-05-2019T14:31:10,CrimsonQuill,"Which would have made her ""master""'s return all the more terrifying"
06-05-2019T14:36:51,Orthonox,I am just thinking of how she probably has to stay in that mansion for a good portion of her life. Getting old while having no friends to talk to. I do not know how she copes other than the possibility of reading about magic.
06-05-2019T14:37:49,CrimsonQuill,"Not to mention the shock of seeing Trace go from mildly racist but overall noble Templar to Xenophobic, Genocidal and completely insane shell of his former self."
06-05-2019T14:41:15,TeapotOfDoom,Good evening y'all!
06-05-2019T14:41:26,Orthonox,"Good afternoon, Teapot."
06-05-2019T14:41:30,CrimsonQuill,Good Evening Teapot!
06-05-2019T14:41:34,CrimsonQuill,:ptv-greetings:
06-05-2019T14:41:50,TeapotOfDoom,Hi guys
06-05-2019T14:42:05,TeapotOfDoom,:ptv-greetings:
06-05-2019T14:42:24,Orthonox,@CrimsonQuill Now I am curious what her life was before getting captured by Templars in search of Euchre.
06-05-2019T14:43:10,TeapotOfDoom,about the solid color i think the emptyness fitts this picture perfectly. I even think that the colorfree version conveys the mood better then color could
06-05-2019T14:43:23,CrimsonQuill,Who knows? It's up to our imagination.
06-05-2019T14:43:38,CrimsonQuill,@TeapotOfDoom Loneliness is crippling.
06-05-2019T14:43:54,CrimsonQuill,"And indeed, this emptiness is served in it's lack of colours..."
06-05-2019T14:44:28,TerraTheWizard,could do a coloured version
06-05-2019T14:44:29,TeapotOfDoom,Definitely. But I wonder what Tom would do. Maybe he would have an even better idea who knows
06-05-2019T14:44:32,TerraTheWizard,but monochrome
06-05-2019T14:45:09,TeapotOfDoom,You mean convert it from Blue and white to black and white?
06-05-2019T14:46:52,TerraTheWizard,something like that
06-05-2019T14:47:27,TeapotOfDoom,I'd honestly stick to blue. Colder color
06-05-2019T16:16:16,Twokinds,orange!
06-05-2019T16:17:38,iliar,Tom. Can you go to IRC?
06-05-2019T16:19:54,TerraTheWizard,:P
06-05-2019T16:20:07,TerraTheWizard,gonna ask my silly question here
06-05-2019T16:20:08,TerraTheWizard,"excluding dragons and characters in the manor, who would you be?"
06-05-2019T16:20:29,CrimsonQuill,Is this to Tom or anyone in the chat?
06-05-2019T16:21:27,TerraTheWizard,anyone
06-05-2019T16:21:34,TerraTheWizard,it's fun:tm:
06-05-2019T16:21:34,CrimsonQuill,"Also, excluding characters in the manor...there goes my first choice."
06-05-2019T16:21:43,TerraTheWizard,"yeah, that's wjy i excluded them"
06-05-2019T16:21:52,TerraTheWizard,i don';t want 4 people answering trace again
06-05-2019T16:22:09,CrimsonQuill,I suppose I'd be Sirius.
06-05-2019T16:22:24,CrimsonQuill,"I rather like him, despite some...questionable acts under his belt."
06-05-2019T16:22:42,CrimsonQuill,"Such as LITERALLY BLOWING UP THE BASITIN ARMS GENERAL. Other than that, he's fine."
06-05-2019T16:23:14,CrimsonQuill,"I have the perfect accent for him too. (Then again, any time I give a character a British accent usually works out well for me)."
06-05-2019T16:23:40,CrimsonQuill,"I could move things behind the scenes, and kick Brahn in the arse with schemes."
06-05-2019T16:23:54,CrimsonQuill,And as long as I get to screw over the gods I'm happy.
06-05-2019T16:24:14,CrimsonQuill,I like it when gods in fiction and mythology don't get what they wanted.
06-05-2019T16:24:27,Bgrmystr2,"By ""questionable acts"" do you mean ""Obvious evil dude actions"" ?"
06-05-2019T16:24:52,CrimsonQuill,"No, I mean homicide."
06-05-2019T16:25:01,CrimsonQuill,"Because let's face it, that's what it was."
06-05-2019T16:25:05,CrimsonQuill,He's not evil.
06-05-2019T16:25:09,Bgrmystr2,so.. exactly what I said.
06-05-2019T16:25:12,CrimsonQuill,But he's not entirely good either.
06-05-2019T16:25:17,Bgrmystr2,Cuz that's literally the definition of evil lol
06-05-2019T16:25:22,Xexanoth,I'd be a random person in the background.....
06-05-2019T16:25:23,CrimsonQuill,Not quite...
06-05-2019T16:25:32,Bgrmystr2,"then brush up on evil, yo"
06-05-2019T16:25:35,TerraTheWizard,the thing with sirius is
06-05-2019T16:25:45,TerraTheWizard,i know someone who refers to him by his first name
06-05-2019T16:25:46,Xexanoth,"Cold Blooded murder is in the ""Obviously Evil Dude"" category...."
06-05-2019T16:25:53,TerraTheWizard,and then all i can think of is blackadder
06-05-2019T16:26:35,CrimsonQuill,"In his defence he was doing it so that Flora and Natani could help Trace, and was trying to make sure that the Basitins were not going to be lobotomized."
06-05-2019T16:26:39,Xexanoth,"""Blackadder, Blackader"":notes:"
06-05-2019T16:26:52,CrimsonQuill,"Sadly, he seems to have a loose definition of ""minimum force""..."
06-05-2019T16:27:05,CrimsonQuill,Blackadder though...he'd do a few things even worse.
06-05-2019T16:27:15,CrimsonQuill,And with far less efficiency.
06-05-2019T16:31:54,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-clovischuckle:
06-05-2019T16:32:30,Twokinds,I wonder if I should include Adelaide's first name on her ref sheet
06-05-2019T16:32:42,Twokinds,It's never mentioned anywhere.
06-05-2019T16:32:45,CrimsonQuill,"Maybe you could, maybe not..."
06-05-2019T16:32:46,TerraTheWizard,her first name is King right?
06-05-2019T16:32:58,CrimsonQuill,We could always just leave it to our imagination.
06-05-2019T16:33:02,CrimsonQuill,Like the Noodle Incident.
06-05-2019T16:33:11,Bgrmystr2,I mean.. it'd be a great lore since we don't actually know.
06-05-2019T16:33:22,Bgrmystr2,that's what reference sheets are for.
06-05-2019T16:33:25,TerraTheWizard,>the noodle incident
06-05-2019T16:33:26,TerraTheWizard,wat?
06-05-2019T16:33:33,CrimsonQuill,"Calvin and Hobbes, Terra."
06-05-2019T16:33:36,TerraTheWizard,ah
06-05-2019T16:33:37,Bgrmystr2,"it's a trope, Terra."
06-05-2019T16:33:45,iliar,Of course you should! More information is better.
06-05-2019T16:33:50,Bgrmystr2,"Not that a literal one didn't already happen, but we don't speak of that."
06-05-2019T16:33:58,CrimsonQuill,Calvin and Hobbes is the trope namer for the trope.
06-05-2019T16:34:01,TerraTheWizard,"i know the trope, i didn't know the specific one that the noodle incident was from"
06-05-2019T16:34:19,CrimsonQuill,Just don't ask Calvin about the noodle incident.
06-05-2019T16:34:27,TerraTheWizard,it's the pinapple & yoyo thing in prequel
06-05-2019T16:34:33,Bgrmystr2,The one I speak of and the trope aren't really conntected lol
06-05-2019T16:34:40,Bgrmystr2,xD Terra
06-05-2019T16:34:41,Bgrmystr2,yes
06-05-2019T16:34:50,CrimsonQuill,"Even Bill Watterson, the creator of the strip, couldn't really figure out what it was."
06-05-2019T16:35:07,Bgrmystr2,"that's cuz he never bothered to think about it, probably."
06-05-2019T16:35:11,Bgrmystr2,It's not supposed to be defined.
06-05-2019T16:35:14,Bgrmystr2,that's the idea.
06-05-2019T16:35:26,CrimsonQuill,Exactly.
06-05-2019T16:35:32,CrimsonQuill,It's better in our imaginations.

06-05-2019T17:36:17,CrimsonQuill,"Edward Templar Sirius VIII, to be precise."
06-05-2019T17:36:20,CrimsonQuill,Or was it VII?
06-05-2019T17:51:16,TeapotOfDoom,Right the fist time Quill
06-05-2019T17:51:30,CrimsonQuill,Oh thank goodness.
06-05-2019T17:51:46,TeapotOfDoom,But still Edmund
06-05-2019T17:51:50,TeapotOfDoom,^^
06-05-2019T17:52:46,CrimsonQuill,"Edmund, not Edward"
06-05-2019T17:52:55,CrimsonQuill,I do become confused by that
06-05-2019T17:53:51,TeapotOfDoom,The name sounds much cooler when spoken in English. As someone who speaks German Edmund sounds kinda funny
06-05-2019T17:54:22,CrimsonQuill,I would nail it then.
06-05-2019T17:55:59,TeapotOfDoom,So Quill how are your exams going?

06-05-2019T20:46:24,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-sleepoverA:
06-05-2019T20:46:32,SpazztasticKiwi,EXACTLY
06-05-2019T20:47:11,Ordithus,So
06-05-2019T20:47:23,Ordithus,How was your first house tour
06-05-2019T20:47:31,SpazztasticKiwi,It needs work
06-05-2019T20:47:37,Ordithus,Most houses do
06-05-2019T20:47:44,Ordithus,"Like, a lot of work?"
06-05-2019T20:47:59,SpazztasticKiwi,But it’s a group of us planning to move in
06-05-2019T20:48:06,Ordithus,sorry brb
06-05-2019T20:48:20,Bgrmystr2,"when we looked for houses a year ago, the ones we looked at didn't really need work at all"
06-05-2019T20:49:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Pool needs to be relined and cleaned. Some minor damage here and there. Old house so what can you do
06-05-2019T20:50:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Main thing is the guest bathroom walls need a new design. Whoever thought red panels with brown on top looked good should be hit with a brick
06-05-2019T20:50:55,SpazztasticKiwi,And I mean it looks like mud smeared on that wall. All chunky and 3d
06-05-2019T20:53:55,SpazztasticKiwi,But there’s a 4 door garage that’s getting turned into rental apartments for extra funds. Two cars and all furniture comes with the house
06-05-2019T20:53:58,Bgrmystr2,"naw screw all that, just some nice color and non-painted natural finished wood in the kitchen"
06-05-2019T20:54:13,Bgrmystr2,somethin simple
06-05-2019T20:54:52,SpazztasticKiwi,The kitchen cabinets gave me color shock. White with blood red tops. REPAINT™️
06-05-2019T20:55:14,Bgrmystr2,least it's not like ours
06-05-2019T20:55:25,Bgrmystr2,that would look better than what's here in this house
06-05-2019T20:55:39,Bgrmystr2,"can't afford to repanit it or whatever, so we're stuck with ugly everything."
06-05-2019T20:56:12,SpazztasticKiwi,The room I’m wanting had plain yellow walls. I’m good with that
06-05-2019T20:56:21,Bgrmystr2,some kinda stupid tanish brown kinda.. yuck
06-05-2019T20:56:41,SpazztasticKiwi,The “man den” is likely gonna be gutted and turned into another bathroom
06-05-2019T20:56:45,Bgrmystr2,instead of the very nice natural wooden finish they had prior when we looked at the house before
06-05-2019T20:57:05,Bgrmystr2,"you mean a ""man cave"" lol"
06-05-2019T20:57:11,Bgrmystr2,and usually those rooms are massive
06-05-2019T20:57:19,Bgrmystr2,and already come with bathrooms on the side
06-05-2019T20:57:42,Bgrmystr2,"besides, they work great for offices and entertainment rooms."
06-05-2019T20:57:45,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s this room off the living room that’s COVERED in sports stuff
06-05-2019T20:58:15,Bgrmystr2,"those rooms are not male-only, make it a room full of stuff you enjoy."
06-05-2019T20:58:23,SpazztasticKiwi,I mean jeez. Obsession. But the paraphernalia can be sold for monz
06-05-2019T20:58:34,Bgrmystr2,I've seen some woman caves too xD
06-05-2019T20:59:16,SpazztasticKiwi,My room is my woman cave. And I’m the banshee that comes out screaming if you flash a light inside
06-05-2019T21:00:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh and there’s landscaping that shows there was once way too many plants around the property
06-05-2019T21:00:46,Bgrmystr2,"For me, I'd probably have a ""man cave"" where I can host friends and do lan parties and other stuff whn they come by. Something I can enjoy with people I know, rather than hole up in.."
06-05-2019T21:02:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Anyone want to guess how deep the pool is
06-05-2019T21:03:43,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-reniderp: back
06-05-2019T21:03:58,Bgrmystr2,wb
06-05-2019T21:04:07,Bgrmystr2,"3foot, enough for a midget. :v"
06-05-2019T21:04:31,Bgrmystr2,"or 30 foot, enough to sink a monster truck."
06-05-2019T21:04:40,Bgrmystr2,"Pick one, cuz a normal pool is out of the question."
06-05-2019T21:05:12,Ordithus,"3 inches, just enough to drown in"
06-05-2019T21:05:50,Bgrmystr2,so.. it's a cup?
06-05-2019T21:06:31,Ordithus,With a very wide rim
06-05-2019T21:06:38,Bgrmystr2,haha
06-05-2019T21:07:02,Ordithus,At some point I'll figure out how I want to redo my kitchen and bathroom.  And finish the basement
06-05-2019T21:07:14,Ordithus,But this year is still windows and exterior doors
06-05-2019T21:07:18,Ordithus,So much $$$$
06-05-2019T21:08:22,SpazztasticKiwi,12 unnecessary feet
06-05-2019T21:08:32,SpazztasticKiwi,And it goes to that from 7
06-05-2019T21:08:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Just straight slope down
06-05-2019T21:09:06,Ordithus,"That's pretty deep, but not extremely deep"
06-05-2019T21:10:04,Bgrmystr2,seems fairly normal for a in-ground pool.
06-05-2019T21:10:41,Bgrmystr2,I haven't seen one in a while though.. since my school field trips probably.
06-05-2019T21:10:42,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s also a hot tub
06-05-2019T21:11:04,Bgrmystr2,since the field trip brought us to disney which.. their pools are.. considered pools yes? Not really home pools though
06-05-2019T21:11:39,Bgrmystr2,prolly pre-2000 since I've seen an actual pool for a house lol
06-05-2019T21:11:52,SpazztasticKiwi,If we get to see it again I might get pictures of the cars. They’re old models and I know one is a GT but we don’t know the extent of the repair
06-05-2019T21:12:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Yet
06-05-2019T21:12:14,Bgrmystr2,Ford GTs are cool
06-05-2019T21:12:42,SpazztasticKiwi,I might take it if it doesn’t cost an inheritance to fix
06-05-2019T21:14:50,Ordithus,Opel GT?
06-05-2019T21:17:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Mustang
06-05-2019T21:17:24,Ordithus,"Ah, neato"
06-05-2019T21:17:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Don’t ask me the year I was told and it flew in one ear and out the other
06-05-2019T21:17:45,Bgrmystr2,Eh.
06-05-2019T21:17:48,Twokinds,hm...
06-05-2019T21:18:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve been writing down nitpicks and points for the past few hours and my bed has somehow managed to eat my pencil
06-05-2019T21:19:16,BadFoMo,Hmm?
06-05-2019T21:19:33,Ordithus,"bad bed, naughty bed"
06-05-2019T21:19:35,SpazztasticKiwi,What’s up Tom
06-05-2019T21:19:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh and the kicker I found is the fact this place comes with its furniture. Including beds. And I just got me a new bed
06-05-2019T21:20:06,Ordithus,Beds on beds?
06-05-2019T21:20:44,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s all the beds for each bedroom plus I saw what looked to be an extra frame in one of the rooms that already had a bed
06-05-2019T21:20:53,SpazztasticKiwi,So yes. Beds on beds
06-05-2019T21:20:59,Twokinds,Thinking about this character page and what to include
06-05-2019T21:21:07,BadFoMo,More beds = Epic Sleep Over.
06-05-2019T21:21:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Who
06-05-2019T21:21:16,Ordithus,Adelaide
06-05-2019T21:21:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Adelaide

06-05-2019T21:22:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Found the pencil
06-05-2019T21:22:53,Ordithus,hoo ray
06-05-2019T21:23:01,Twokinds,Just making sure I never said her first name anywhere else

06-05-2019T21:25:14,BadFoMo,Burtha Adelaide?
06-05-2019T21:26:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"König Rey King Adelaide, all hail"
06-05-2019T21:28:51,Bgrmystr2,She's like Torgue.. his first name is Mister. xD
06-05-2019T21:29:51,BadFoMo,Or 'Prince' from 'Inherit the Earth'.
06-05-2019T21:30:46,SpazztasticKiwi,"It’s a bit of a joke. König and Rey both mean king, as does king obviously, and Adelaide means noble one"
06-05-2019T21:31:13,SpazztasticKiwi,So I just called her King King King Noble One
06-05-2019T21:31:22,SpazztasticKiwi,All the crowns
06-05-2019T21:32:04,Twokinds,What if her name is Queen.
06-05-2019T21:32:10,Twokinds,Just to confuse people more.
06-05-2019T21:32:27,unsteddyphoenix,Oh no
06-05-2019T21:32:41,Twokinds,King Queen Princess Adelaide

06-05-2019T21:33:53,unsteddyphoenix,"""Whats momma Adelaides name again?"" ""Yes."""
06-05-2019T21:34:11,Bgrmystr2,"If 'Princess' is her middle name, that's fucking brilliant"

06-05-2019T21:34:57,SpazztasticKiwi,This conversation in a nutshell
06-05-2019T21:35:07,Bgrmystr2,can confirm.
06-05-2019T21:35:16,Twokinds,Her name is actually Jade.

06-05-2019T21:37:44,unsteddyphoenix,It does sound vaguely delicious
06-05-2019T21:37:49,unsteddyphoenix,Next billboard confirmed
06-05-2019T21:39:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Ah yes. The king proudly being shown knocking back a full pint in seconds while the entire right side of the ad is covered in disclaimers and warnings that so much as smelling the stuff would kill you and your grandchildren

06-05-2019T21:42:18,SpazztasticKiwi,anyone got a word for the things you put your plants on in windows and outside? Planters? Or am I imagining the possibility of a nonexistent word
06-05-2019T21:42:47,SpazztasticKiwi,I swear to all that’s holy if someone says “table”
06-05-2019T21:43:28,unsteddyphoenix,pots
06-05-2019T21:44:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Not in. On. I got pots
06-05-2019T21:44:32,unsteddyphoenix,In pot on a pot
06-05-2019T21:44:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Since I’ll have a high window and patio doors I figure I’ll have non feline accessible areas for plants
06-05-2019T21:45:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"well, *possibly that is"
06-05-2019T21:45:32,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m still very much running over everything

06-05-2019T21:49:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I might have been looking for shelf
06-05-2019T21:50:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m very much a cactus and such person but I’m an absolute sucker for the mini roses
06-05-2019T21:53:18,Mippy,I just leaned they are opening a Cat Caffé in my city. I want to drink tea 🍵 and cuddle cats. WHY DO I HAVE TO BE ALLERGIC?! :ctwokinds-LauraCry:

06-05-2019T21:57:19,unsteddyphoenix,Would be extremely handy to have a pocket-rose for when you need to give someone a disapproving look
06-05-2019T21:57:49,Twokinds,Well that's what Nibbly is for
06-05-2019T21:58:10,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-power: indeed

06-05-2019T22:08:07,unsteddyphoenix,Depends how cool the bookshelf is
06-05-2019T22:08:39,Mippy,Lol
06-05-2019T22:09:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Why does a bookshelf need a checklist on whether it needs batteries
06-05-2019T22:09:36,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s not a kindle
06-05-2019T22:09:56,Ordithus,"Yeah, it can't hold nearly as many books"
06-05-2019T22:10:53,Mippy,I had a bookshelf incident...my top shelf collapsed under the weight of books.
06-05-2019T22:10:57,Bgrmystr2,how else do you expect to recharge the batteries of the bookshelf so it can have the strength to hold up all those books..
06-05-2019T22:13:23,SpazztasticKiwi,I just want a lil more room than 24x32 with 2 shelves
06-05-2019T22:13:41,SpazztasticKiwi,My books are calling for air

06-05-2019T23:08:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Neither likes strangers. Kiwi hates men particularly - she’s yet to warm up to one and is scared of any four legged visitors. Bagheera is generally just jealous most likely and is terrified of big dogs
