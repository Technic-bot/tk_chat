15-04-2019T00:15:29,SpazztasticKiwi,peanut butter jelly time
15-04-2019T00:16:42,Bgrmystr2,:evergreen_tree::evergreen_tree::christmas_tree::banana::tent::ptv-sleepy:
15-04-2019T00:17:07,Bgrmystr2,..how the fuck does it keep deleting icons. Fucking picarto
15-04-2019T00:17:21,Bgrmystr2,:fire::fire::evergreen_tree::fire::fire::fire::fire::ptv-pouty:
15-04-2019T00:17:56,Bgrmystr2,"everything burns down, start again next time."
15-04-2019T00:21:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh there‚Äôs a joke but it‚Äôs terrible
15-04-2019T00:27:16,Bgrmystr2,"Yes, we know france tried it first. It's not working for them. :/"
15-04-2019T00:27:32,Bgrmystr2,Saw that comin.
15-04-2019T00:28:39,Bgrmystr2,maybe next time I camp next to a campfire.. picarto won't admin-delete the fire.
15-04-2019T00:29:25,SpazztasticKiwi,That wasn‚Äôt it but that makes more sense
15-04-2019T00:29:39,Bgrmystr2,"Well, worth a shot."
15-04-2019T00:29:47,SpazztasticKiwi,I did hear a joke from this comedians stand up that I‚Äôve been thinking of for awhile
15-04-2019T00:30:00,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs terrible but in a more insulting way
15-04-2019T00:30:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Dude was making fun of his son
15-04-2019T00:59:22,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
15-04-2019T01:14:50,SpazztasticKiwi,And I believe seeing a documentary on a ‚Äúpurity ball‚Äù is one of the most officially horrifying things I‚Äôve seen
15-04-2019T01:15:18,Bgrmystr2,do.. I even want to know
15-04-2019T01:17:19,Bgrmystr2,okay that was not exactly as bad as I expected it to be
15-04-2019T01:21:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Daughters dress in white to go to a ball with their fathers to pledge they will wait until marriage before kissing and sex
15-04-2019T01:22:50,SpazztasticKiwi,the father is given a key to give to the future husband on the wedding day and a purity band to give the daughter later as a token of the promise to be worn on the wedding finger
15-04-2019T01:23:08,SpazztasticKiwi,And the girl is given a white rose and tiara
15-04-2019T01:23:09,Bgrmystr2,yeah...
15-04-2019T01:23:17,Bgrmystr2,very strange
15-04-2019T01:23:25,SpazztasticKiwi,my minds screaming cult
15-04-2019T01:23:27,Bgrmystr2,and seemingly extremely old-fashioned
15-04-2019T01:23:52,Bgrmystr2,"The whole thing screams like it's back before women had the right to do anything, and the men chose for them."
15-04-2019T01:23:56,SpazztasticKiwi,It is and I get it but there‚Äôs a line where you get to the extreme and they‚Äôre tap dancing on it
15-04-2019T01:23:56,Bgrmystr2,"which is dumb, but yknow"
15-04-2019T01:24:16,SpazztasticKiwi,I got a question that‚Äôll stump em tho
15-04-2019T01:24:44,SpazztasticKiwi,How do you do this mess with a girl who‚Äôs not got her dad anymore
15-04-2019T01:24:51,SpazztasticKiwi,checkmate
15-04-2019T01:25:21,SpazztasticKiwi,"Or better yet, this promise is something that belongs to the girl, not the father or anyone else"
15-04-2019T01:25:27,Bgrmystr2,"I don't know if japan has that kind of thing specifically, but there is something similar where guys have to be able to impress the girl's dad or whatnot or he won't allow them to marry his daughter.. like he really has any choice over someone else's life"
15-04-2019T01:25:49,SpazztasticKiwi,That‚Äôs something for a lot of places isn‚Äôt it
15-04-2019T01:26:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Gotta be successful or rich or whatnot
15-04-2019T01:26:16,Bgrmystr2,"but it's such an ingrained thing in their society, they even have parents that decide on who their kids marry for political or monitary gain"
15-04-2019T01:26:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Or offer a dowry thing
15-04-2019T01:26:22,Bgrmystr2,rather than whether the kid will be happy or not
15-04-2019T01:26:40,Bgrmystr2,"they don't care about the happiness, they just want a better public standing"
15-04-2019T01:26:52,Bgrmystr2,the whole damn thing is cruel and selfish :/
15-04-2019T01:27:05,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúThis will bring peace to our land and future‚Äù
15-04-2019T01:27:16,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúHe‚Äôs over ten years older than me‚Äù
15-04-2019T01:27:18,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúShh‚Äù
15-04-2019T02:05:23,SpazztasticKiwi,A whole bed and cat decides that I‚Äôm the bed
15-04-2019T02:11:42,PotatoRights,Is the nibbly saxiphone solo ever gonna be released?
15-04-2019T02:12:09,PotatoRights,The one from the stream on april 8th 20
15-04-2019T02:12:20,PotatoRights,*2018
15-04-2019T02:12:49,PotatoRights,About 5 hours 50 minutes into the stream
15-04-2019T02:14:57,Bgrmystr2,uh? Didn't he already release it somewhere lol
15-04-2019T02:18:38,Bgrmystr2,https://www.patreon.com/posts/twokinds-jazz-20319845 I know he already did this image
15-04-2019T02:19:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Isn‚Äôt that the fun
15-04-2019T02:20:08,Bgrmystr2,'the fun' :thinking:
15-04-2019T02:20:12,SpazztasticKiwi,so much in the queue you never know what he‚Äôll finish next
15-04-2019T02:20:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Always a surprise
15-04-2019T02:21:12,SpazztasticKiwi,How I see it most of the time. I‚Äôm not hard to entertain
15-04-2019T02:21:27,SpazztasticKiwi,I watch Markiplier
15-04-2019T02:22:51,Bgrmystr2,"Lol I'm not quite sure what you're getting at, he just wanted to know if the nibbly sax was posted somewhere since tom doodled it, and I'm not sure. Maybe, but I don't know of any guaranteed sources besides the screenshots people took."
15-04-2019T02:23:46,SpazztasticKiwi,I know
15-04-2019T02:24:11,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm just edging on that line where everything is hilarious
15-04-2019T02:24:24,SpazztasticKiwi,"Ergo, it‚Äôs bedtime"
15-04-2019T02:24:41,Bgrmystr2,"I think you should go to bed, young lady. xD"
15-04-2019T02:33:59,PotatoRights,Its not the same one
15-04-2019T02:34:16,PotatoRights,I think it should be brought to tom‚Äôs attention
15-04-2019T02:35:22,Bgrmystr2,"no it's not the same one, but it was obviously inspired by that"
15-04-2019T02:43:15,PotatoRights,"Anyways, goodnight"
15-04-2019T02:44:17,PotatoRights,"And wait, I‚Äôm not the only one who remembers that piece?"
15-04-2019T02:45:18,Bgrmystr2,"the sax nibbly? Or the jazz one, cuz the sax nibbly has been a thing in the chat since he drew that. every time a song with a sax comes on, people post nibblys and saxophones in the chat"
15-04-2019T02:45:24,Bgrmystr2,it's been a thing forever now.
15-04-2019T02:45:45,Bgrmystr2,neon has his own custom emote he made from the nibbly image you were asking about too

15-04-2019T16:10:15,SpazztasticKiwi,"‚ÄúBad part about being the guy in the relationship is if there‚Äôs a noise at 3 am, you‚Äôre the one that has to go check it out‚Äù"

15-04-2019T16:11:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Nice to see you‚Äôre alive
15-04-2019T16:18:22,Twokinds,I am
15-04-2019T16:18:32,Twokinds,Glad to be alive
15-04-2019T16:21:48,SpazztasticKiwi,üåà
15-04-2019T16:24:35,Azumachan,Nice Work Tom.
15-04-2019T16:30:32,iliar,"Hi Tom. I have a question about Nora Cards. Did you remember, I asked about the publication PSD files?"
15-04-2019T16:30:34,iliar,You said you didn't want to do this. But what about post files in original resolution?
15-04-2019T16:37:52,Twokinds,"You mean, like posting PNGs in high resolution?"
15-04-2019T16:38:01,iliar,Yes
15-04-2019T16:38:10,Twokinds,I'm okay with that.
15-04-2019T16:38:12,SpazztasticKiwi,oh I saw a baby squirrel today
15-04-2019T16:38:16,Twokinds,Aw!
15-04-2019T16:39:11,SpazztasticKiwi,precious lil thing but I scared the fire out of it and it just panicked for a second deciding which way to run
15-04-2019T16:39:12,Azumachan,"Hey, Tom are you going to draw the info windows too on the reff ? It's coming along nicely so far."
15-04-2019T16:40:20,iliar,I think people will be glad if at least some things you publish in the original resolution.
15-04-2019T16:41:43,Twokinds,Yeah of course
15-04-2019T16:47:27,iliar,Glad to hear it. Although I need to prepare for this. I think my bot may have problems with files more than 8 megabytes.
15-04-2019T16:48:12,Azumachan,Nibs need more energy to deal with the files ?
15-04-2019T16:51:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera found a snake
15-04-2019T16:58:39,Mippy,[SNAKE!]*:ctwokinds-nataniAAAAshake:
15-04-2019T17:09:36,iliar,Funny fact. When Tom said that Nora Cards can be used for remake old scenes in a comic. First Kiss Keith and Natani was first thing about I was thinking. Although I prefer a kiss on the ship. But I thought that this scene was already well drawn.
15-04-2019T17:10:20,iliar,Discord has a limit of 8 megabytes for attachments.
15-04-2019T17:10:51,iliar,And I do not know how to increase it for the bot.
15-04-2019T17:24:15,TerraTheWizard,"hmm, yeah, that's a point"
15-04-2019T17:24:24,TerraTheWizard,i have no idea if you can give bots nitro
15-04-2019T17:25:01,TerraTheWizard,never seen one with it
15-04-2019T17:50:47,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
15-04-2019T17:57:05,Xerenowicz,There's probably no way to give bot a nitro subscription. Of course without breaking discord TOS and creating an user-bot
15-04-2019T17:59:47,Bgrmystr2,I don't see how it would break the TOS at all
15-04-2019T19:47:24,Twokinds,I'm trrying to find a way to describe Flora on her character sheet as being a little dumb without being mean about it XD
15-04-2019T19:47:49,Bgrmystr2,she's an airhead?
15-04-2019T19:47:52,Twokinds,"I mean she's not stupid, but she also isn't always the sharpest tool in the shed lol"
15-04-2019T19:49:36,unsteddyphoenix,Just put that exact line lol
15-04-2019T19:49:40,Twokinds,"She's just, you know, a simple farm girl. Not book smart like Raine. Nothing wrong with that."
15-04-2019T19:50:10,unsteddyphoenix,Just a small town girl~
15-04-2019T19:50:51,unsteddyphoenix,Hmm
15-04-2019T19:50:59,unsteddyphoenix,everything im thinking of is mean too
15-04-2019T19:51:21,Twokinds,Yeah same
15-04-2019T19:51:38,Twokinds,I Simpleton or ditz is just... it's not right. They're too negative.
15-04-2019T19:51:40,Azumachan,True to herself ?
15-04-2019T19:51:52,Bgrmystr2,I don't think ditz is negative
15-04-2019T19:52:01,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah ditz isnt THAT bad
15-04-2019T19:52:16,Twokinds,Yeah but she's not really ditzy
15-04-2019T19:52:22,unsteddyphoenix,Aflorable
15-04-2019T19:52:23,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
15-04-2019T19:52:28,Twokinds,Ditzy I think of someone who's a clutz.
15-04-2019T19:52:37,Bgrmystr2,yeah true
15-04-2019T19:52:38,Azumachan,^
15-04-2019T19:53:00,Bgrmystr2,"but I think ditz is more mental, clutz is more like.. physical"
15-04-2019T19:53:01,unsteddyphoenix,"Idk, I think of someone with low attention spans"
15-04-2019T19:53:16,unsteddyphoenix,Like someone who would suddenly chase a butterfly outta nowhere
15-04-2019T19:53:19,Azumachan,Dorky maybe ?
15-04-2019T19:53:30,Bgrmystr2,that's more of Reni
15-04-2019T19:53:33,unsteddyphoenix,Shes the opposite of dorky
15-04-2019T19:53:37,Twokinds,"yeah, nah, Dorky isn't right"
15-04-2019T19:53:48,Twokinds,Easily destracted
15-04-2019T19:54:14,unsteddyphoenix,scatterbrain?
15-04-2019T19:54:31,Bgrmystr2,"nah I think Ditz kinda fits. She's not really a clutz, she doesn't really accidentally and fall down and trip over herself"
15-04-2019T19:54:32,Azumachan,A lout then ?
15-04-2019T19:54:54,Twokinds,No one uses lout
15-04-2019T19:54:58,Bgrmystr2,xD
15-04-2019T19:55:02,unsteddyphoenix,Also lout is too mean
15-04-2019T19:55:12,unsteddyphoenix,Childish?
15-04-2019T19:56:07,Twokinds,yeah that might be better
15-04-2019T19:56:11,Twokinds,Childlike
15-04-2019T19:56:46,unsteddyphoenix,"That or featherbrained, scatterbrained, along those lines."
15-04-2019T19:58:10,Twokinds,Down to earth
15-04-2019T19:58:31,Bgrmystr2,"hmm, that doesn't really mean the same thing"
15-04-2019T19:58:39,unsteddyphoenix,thats a compliment though
15-04-2019T19:58:49,Azumachan,juvenile ?
15-04-2019T19:58:49,Twokinds,Yeah but it describes Flora doesn't it?
15-04-2019T19:59:24,Bgrmystr2,"hmm, I wouldn't think so"
15-04-2019T19:59:34,Twokinds,No?
15-04-2019T19:59:42,Bgrmystr2,"You say that, I think of more Adria"
15-04-2019T20:00:36,Twokinds,"How about ""head in the clouds""?"
15-04-2019T20:00:53,unsteddyphoenix,Oh I kinda like that
15-04-2019T20:01:05,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah I wouldnt describe her as down to earth either, personally."
15-04-2019T20:01:56,Azumachan,ingenuous
15-04-2019T20:02:13,unsteddyphoenix,"You have a theasaurus open, dont you"
15-04-2019T20:02:38,Azumachan,Yep
15-04-2019T20:02:52,Twokinds,I've never heard that
15-04-2019T20:03:03,Twokinds,I misread it as ingenius at ifrst
15-04-2019T20:03:09,Azumachan,It helps with synonyms
15-04-2019T20:03:26,Azumachan,https://www.thesaurus.com/browse/ingenuous
15-04-2019T20:03:44,unsteddyphoenix,"Youve probably heard ""disingenuous"" though"
15-04-2019T20:03:57,Twokinds,How about earnest.
15-04-2019T20:04:07,Twokinds,"And yeah, of course, disingenuous"
15-04-2019T20:04:14,Twokinds,But I don't think anyone would really use ingenuous
15-04-2019T20:04:19,unsteddyphoenix,Earnest is very right
15-04-2019T20:04:25,unsteddyphoenix,And yeah its rarely used
15-04-2019T20:04:32,Bgrmystr2,"I like how the longer this goes on, the more things that describe flora mean the same as ditz.. and then tom just goes off thattaway"
15-04-2019T20:05:07,Bgrmystr2,yeah I'd say flora's earnest
15-04-2019T20:05:08,Twokinds,Well I'm thinking of any way to describe Flora's mental characterstics or personality.
15-04-2019T20:05:57,Bgrmystr2,lol... Earnest. Low interest loans!
15-04-2019T20:06:00,Bgrmystr2,thanks internet.
15-04-2019T20:06:14,unsteddyphoenix,???
15-04-2019T20:07:15,Bgrmystr2,it's apparently the name of a company
15-04-2019T20:07:24,unsteddyphoenix,Shes pretty energetic. Is there a better why to say that
15-04-2019T20:07:26,Bgrmystr2,so just searching it won't give you definitions as the first result
15-04-2019T20:07:29,unsteddyphoenix,Bouncy!
15-04-2019T20:07:38,unsteddyphoenix,Thats cute
15-04-2019T20:07:41,Bgrmystr2,"lol, she is very bouncy, she just doesn't bounce."
15-04-2019T20:07:47,Bgrmystr2,..much.
15-04-2019T20:07:50,unsteddyphoenix,The irony is palpable
15-04-2019T20:07:51,Twokinds,she pounces
15-04-2019T20:08:03,unsteddyphoenix,Character trait: pouncy
15-04-2019T20:08:03,Bgrmystr2,it makes up for it
15-04-2019T20:08:07,Bgrmystr2,haha
15-04-2019T20:08:20,unsteddyphoenix,Bubbly?
15-04-2019T20:08:50,unsteddyphoenix,Emotional?
15-04-2019T20:08:51,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: I.. don't know on that
15-04-2019T20:08:54,Twokinds,"Eh, she isn't really ""bubbly"""
15-04-2019T20:09:12,Twokinds,And her emotional moments are due to pregnancy mostly
15-04-2019T20:09:13,Bgrmystr2,"she has her bubbly moments, but it's not a trait"
15-04-2019T20:09:15,Twokinds,She is romantic
15-04-2019T20:09:25,Twokinds,She has a wanderlust
15-04-2019T20:09:41,unsteddyphoenix,You think so? She seemed to be having feelings all over the place to me

15-04-2019T20:57:39,Twokinds,Flora eventually decided she had to leave the life behind and ran.
15-04-2019T20:58:32,CrRAR,Euchre was on the farm doing farm-stuff to fund his education right?

15-04-2019T21:02:33,Twokinds,"It's complicated. Some keidran are freer than others in human society, but it's always a tenuous relationship."
15-04-2019T21:02:45,Twokinds,Keidran have to always be careful to 'know their place' among humans.

15-04-2019T21:09:00,Twokinds,Same goes for the other way around.

15-04-2019T21:41:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Just for the sake of sparing him surprise acupuncture

15-04-2019T21:43:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I like all of my cats but I‚Äôm not a fan of being stabbed when they want to march on my chest
15-04-2019T21:43:14,unsteddyphoenix,dont declaw your cats/wife
15-04-2019T21:43:32,CrRAR,"Also, I question the sanity of any man to approach a sharp-clawed creature... with teensy clippers."
15-04-2019T21:43:36,Bgrmystr2,"think of it this way. If you make the claws not as sharp, then the parts that are shaved off are not part of them anymore"
15-04-2019T21:43:43,Bgrmystr2,they just happen to be stuff on the ground.
15-04-2019T21:43:46,Bgrmystr2,so..

15-04-2019T21:45:41,SpazztasticKiwi,I sometimes debate whether I should sharpen my nails when they grow out
15-04-2019T21:45:47,Twokinds,I added a steak
15-04-2019T21:45:56,Bgrmystr2,so now there's two steaks?

15-04-2019T21:46:48,CrRAR,I read that as if TOM was surprised to find a steak in the drawing.
15-04-2019T21:46:52,CrRAR,xD

15-04-2019T21:59:22,Bgrmystr2,that's a tough one
15-04-2019T22:00:39,Bgrmystr2,"preggart is not as long for Flora as for us hoomans.. but I don't know how long it'll take for zen's leg to heal, even with healing magic, there's still infection"

15-04-2019T22:02:21,Bgrmystr2,I'm more inclined to believe that Zen's leg would probably be healed enough for him to be using crutches or somesuch before flora has her baby
15-04-2019T22:02:29,Bgrmystr2,but I doubt it'll be fully healed before then.
15-04-2019T22:02:55,Bgrmystr2,"though I don't think they would have crutches in Mekkan at all. But y'know, just if they did."
15-04-2019T22:04:24,CrRAR,The concept exists... youngtani referenced a ‚Äúcrutch‚Äù.
15-04-2019T22:04:54,Bgrmystr2,"hm, does it?"
15-04-2019T22:04:55,CrRAR,"Figuratively, though as far as Zen was involved in the psyche though."

15-04-2019T22:48:11,unsteddyphoenix,The technical term is 'tasty' correct
15-04-2019T22:48:16,Dadrobit,"I literally told our server ""chef's choice, surprise me!"""
15-04-2019T22:48:27,Dadrobit,So I actually have no clue.

15-04-2019T22:49:31,Dadrobit,I am normally super good about watching my food intake and not over eating. I actually couldn't help but eat too much. It was that good.

15-04-2019T22:50:27,unsteddyphoenix,Sometimes it really be that way
15-04-2019T22:50:51,Dadrobit,"Also, ""chef's choice"" is just really helpful when you're too indecisive/ when the menu is too expansive."
15-04-2019T22:51:58,Dadrobit,"The place was called ""Sal's"". One of those places where you know that whatever you get, it's gonna be a good time."
15-04-2019T22:52:31,Dadrobit,So no choice was the easy choice.

15-04-2019T23:48:59,Bgrmystr2,you didn't look at it on MAL before watching it.. why?
15-04-2019T23:50:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Generally I will google an anime before trying it
15-04-2019T23:51:14,SpazztasticKiwi,But I just jumped in on this one since I‚Äôve seen snippets of it and knew the gist of the vampires n such
15-04-2019T23:51:21,SpazztasticKiwi,But oh boy
15-04-2019T23:52:03,SpazztasticKiwi,throw it in the Mariana trench
