15-07-2019T04:04:44,SpazztasticKiwi,guy is trying to be celibate before a dr visit for cell freezing for donation and his wife is trying her best to seduce him. He ended up going to sleep on his neighbors couch
15-07-2019T04:05:09,SpazztasticKiwi,for more context this neighbor is across the hall and I’m talking about a show
15-07-2019T04:17:54,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
15-07-2019T04:30:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I got a bit of a kick
15-07-2019T04:31:46,SpazztasticKiwi,ridiculousness gets me
15-07-2019T04:36:46,SpazztasticKiwi,sleeps a really good idea for me right now I can feel it
15-07-2019T08:21:59,SniperJackal,@CrimsonQuill are you enjoying SPV3?
15-07-2019T08:35:50,AspiringNoodle,"Man, this is so nice <3"
15-07-2019T08:36:16,AspiringNoodle,"Even if I slept a bit longer today than the past 2 days, it's so much fun being able to sleep the whole night without getting up 2, 3, 4 times for w/e reason"
15-07-2019T09:00:04,AspiringNoodle,Just pulled out all the giftcards I've gotten over the past 2 - 3 three years building up to this new build
15-07-2019T09:00:25,AspiringNoodle,Got slapped in the face with how much I was sitting on
15-07-2019T10:45:37,AspiringNoodle,"And like that, done with OPM season 2 :ptv-hearts:"

15-07-2019T11:12:10,AspiringNoodle,So pretty~
15-07-2019T11:12:20,AspiringNoodle,Unlike Twitter's new design :ptv-unimpressed:
15-07-2019T11:37:50,TerraTheWizard,"they keep asking me to ""check it out"""
15-07-2019T11:37:53,TerraTheWizard,so i close it
15-07-2019T11:38:36,TerraTheWizard,it's not forced me onto it yet
15-07-2019T11:38:53,TerraTheWizard,apparently you can use the old layout if you turn something on in the settings
15-07-2019T12:31:40,CrimsonQuill,Good evening
15-07-2019T12:43:03,BadFoMo,Yo.

15-07-2019T13:12:33,CrimsonQuill,:ctwokinds-nibsdance:
15-07-2019T13:12:58,CrimsonQuill,I wonder if Tom'll drop by
15-07-2019T13:13:03,CrimsonQuill,I need to ask him something
15-07-2019T13:15:12,SniperJackal,"Oh hey quill, enjoying SPV3?"
15-07-2019T13:15:22,TerraTheWizard,you can always email him if it's important
15-07-2019T13:15:27,CrimsonQuill,@SniperJackal By God I am!
15-07-2019T13:15:32,TerraTheWizard,he's probably busy with comicon prep
15-07-2019T13:15:43,SniperJackal,good to hear that
15-07-2019T13:15:51,SniperJackal,I am replaying it today
15-07-2019T13:16:20,CrimsonQuill,"@TerraTheWizard I just want to ask if I can have Raine in a Halo fanart picture, because I wanted to stick her in in her armour."
15-07-2019T13:16:54,CrimsonQuill,"@SniperJackal My aim is poor, but I'm getting better. The combat is so cool-very run-and-gun, very bouncy, very open."
15-07-2019T13:17:07,SniperJackal,yup
15-07-2019T13:17:07,CrimsonQuill,And the marines are awesome-Chips Dubbo is my constant companion
15-07-2019T13:17:22,SniperJackal,marines also have some extra dialogue I think
15-07-2019T13:17:29,CrimsonQuill,I just love it.
15-07-2019T13:17:44,SniperJackal,I love how you can make absolute chaos with gravity grenades
15-07-2019T13:17:52,SniperJackal,and chain reactions
15-07-2019T13:17:58,CrimsonQuill,"And Foehammer-I watched the cutscenes on Youtube for CE Anniversary, but playing the game and seeing her is wonderful."
15-07-2019T13:18:12,SniperJackal,rip foehammer
15-07-2019T13:18:16,CrimsonQuill,She is by far one of the most underrated characters in the franchise.
15-07-2019T13:18:21,SniperJackal,true
15-07-2019T13:18:34,SniperJackal,It would be cool to escape with her at the last mission
15-07-2019T13:18:50,CrimsonQuill,"Alas, war is Hell, and the Banshees took her out..."
15-07-2019T13:18:53,CrimsonQuill,"By the way,"
15-07-2019T13:19:08,CrimsonQuill,Just how tough are enemy shields in Noble difficulty?
15-07-2019T13:19:15,SniperJackal,uhm quite
15-07-2019T13:19:17,CrimsonQuill,And are they significantly smarter?
15-07-2019T13:19:23,SniperJackal,they shoot faster
15-07-2019T13:19:28,SniperJackal,and move more I think
15-07-2019T13:19:29,CrimsonQuill,Uh oh
15-07-2019T13:19:39,CrimsonQuill,I died quite a few times first level
15-07-2019T13:19:42,SniperJackal,"I mean I dont think they shoot faster, but they do spam more"
15-07-2019T13:19:49,CrimsonQuill,It's like starting Halo as a complete noob
15-07-2019T13:19:58,CrimsonQuill,And I still am a relative noob
15-07-2019T13:20:03,CrimsonQuill,But it's awesome.
15-07-2019T13:20:12,SniperJackal,when you are a noob you enjoy the game more
15-07-2019T13:20:23,CrimsonQuill,Really? How so?
15-07-2019T13:20:33,SniperJackal,you experience everything for the first time
15-07-2019T13:20:39,CrimsonQuill,True
15-07-2019T13:20:39,TerraTheWizard,what do you mean have her in a fanart picture?you mean one you're drawing?
15-07-2019T13:21:01,TerraTheWizard,because you can use tom's characters as long as you credit them to him
15-07-2019T13:21:05,CrimsonQuill,"@TerraTheWizard Yes, it has two of my OCs in it and a deviant's OC with Whom I am making an art trade."
15-07-2019T13:21:23,CrimsonQuill,I want to have Spartan Raine (as she's part of the fireteam) peeking through the doorway
15-07-2019T13:21:36,CrimsonQuill,It's actually a redraw
15-07-2019T13:21:40,CrimsonQuill,Permisson to link?
15-07-2019T13:22:59,SniperJackal,"I think you can post links when tom isnt streaming, but im not sure"
15-07-2019T13:23:12,SniperJackal,dont quote me on that
15-07-2019T13:23:47,CrimsonQuill,I'll whisper it anyway to be safe
15-07-2019T13:24:14,CrimsonQuill,I basically want to replace the generic person at the door with Raine and my second OC
15-07-2019T13:24:28,CrimsonQuill,The bearded guy is her fireteam captain-my OC
15-07-2019T13:24:36,CrimsonQuill,Spartan Thomas Bailey
15-07-2019T13:24:51,CrimsonQuill,I just need to know whether I'm allowed
15-07-2019T13:25:23,SniperJackal,looks good
15-07-2019T13:26:05,CrimsonQuill,"Trust me, the redraw is going to be better"
15-07-2019T13:26:08,CrimsonQuill,I rushed this one
15-07-2019T13:26:12,SniperJackal,"when I tried to draw a person/character, uhm well it took me hours and it wasnt even good plus it was stressful"
15-07-2019T13:26:25,CrimsonQuill,I find it relaxing
15-07-2019T13:26:27,SniperJackal,I reall wanna draw but I just get stressed out
15-07-2019T13:26:45,CrimsonQuill,I changed the chest piece for Bailey to Fred's from 5
15-07-2019T13:26:56,CrimsonQuill,It was a nightmare to get right thoug
15-07-2019T13:26:59,CrimsonQuill,though
15-07-2019T13:27:10,CrimsonQuill,But so satisfying when it did click.
15-07-2019T13:27:23,CrimsonQuill,I'm in the process of inking in the lines
15-07-2019T13:27:35,CrimsonQuill,"Then I'll colour, scan and upload it."
15-07-2019T13:27:50,SniperJackal,"I cant really say much about art, but I can say that It definately looks like a spartan"
15-07-2019T13:28:08,CrimsonQuill,:)
15-07-2019T13:28:21,CrimsonQuill,Weeellll....some of the proportions are off
15-07-2019T13:28:30,CrimsonQuill,So I was fixing those
15-07-2019T13:28:40,CrimsonQuill,And giving him Emile's right shoulder
15-07-2019T13:28:45,SniperJackal,yeah thats quite hard to do
15-07-2019T13:28:48,CrimsonQuill,And MK VI Forearms
15-07-2019T13:28:56,CrimsonQuill,His armour is a custom build
15-07-2019T13:29:01,CrimsonQuill,He and a friend made it
15-07-2019T13:29:06,CrimsonQuill,Against regulations
15-07-2019T13:29:13,CrimsonQuill,Because they knew ONI wouldn't like it
15-07-2019T13:29:21,CrimsonQuill,And they wanted to piss off ONI
15-07-2019T13:30:12,SniperJackal,tho the spartans I think are maybe too bulky
15-07-2019T13:30:21,SniperJackal,but thats probably just me
15-07-2019T13:32:34,CrimsonQuill,I'm working on it
15-07-2019T13:32:45,CrimsonQuill,The more I do the better I'll become
15-07-2019T13:32:53,CrimsonQuill,In time I hope to reach Tom's skill
15-07-2019T13:33:06,CrimsonQuill,Where he barely needs guidlines for sketches etc
15-07-2019T13:36:26,CrimsonQuill,I might be back in a bit
15-07-2019T13:36:33,CrimsonQuill,A few things to do
15-07-2019T13:36:35,CrimsonQuill,Cheerio

15-07-2019T14:38:53,AspiringNoodle,Can't wait for applicant tracking systems to just blow up in corporate America's face
15-07-2019T14:56:47,TerraTheWizard,it's not just america
15-07-2019T15:03:25,AspiringNoodle,Good to know the whole world is creating useless bureaucracy for the sake of more red tape!
15-07-2019T15:04:06,AspiringNoodle,"So, a gas station near where I live is hiring, and they're using a third-party website if you want to apply online.  I started up the application, and immediately got annoyed"
15-07-2019T15:04:45,AspiringNoodle,I think I'll do an in-store application if possible
15-07-2019T15:08:06,AspiringNoodle,"...lol, love it when companies don't even try to hide the fact that they want you to push stuff anymore"
15-07-2019T15:08:20,AspiringNoodle,Up selling/Suggestive selling
15-07-2019T15:08:32,AspiringNoodle,Literally a job responsibility on a posting I'm looking over

15-07-2019T17:31:02,TerraTheWizard,have a bad photo from my phone https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/165725395348357120/600808553086844938/image0.jpg
15-07-2019T17:32:10,IronHorseComics,"oh that's normal, even high end cameras have trouble with that"
15-07-2019T17:32:34,Bgrmystr2,smol city pretty lights
15-07-2019T17:32:53,IronHorseComics,wanna know the secret I learned in the digital photography class I took in college?
15-07-2019T17:33:55,IronHorseComics,"you take two photos, one with high exposure and one with low exposure, then you combine them. IF I'm remembering that correctly"
15-07-2019T17:40:32,TerraTheWizard,hdr
15-07-2019T17:40:38,TerraTheWizard,ios has a setting for that
15-07-2019T17:40:46,TerraTheWizard,"can't hold my phone still enough though, lol"
15-07-2019T17:59:09,iliar,About the night photo.  I was impressed by how well modern phones cope with this task.
15-07-2019T18:03:43,iliar,I remember before getting a normal result at night was absolutely impossible.
15-07-2019T18:05:02,SpazztasticKiwi,someone help me
15-07-2019T18:05:16,SpazztasticKiwi,These squirrels at the park are walking right up to my car door
15-07-2019T18:05:33,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t have food for em what do they want
15-07-2019T18:07:06,IronHorseComics,are you in the car right now?
15-07-2019T18:08:40,SpazztasticKiwi,why would I say they’re walking up to my car door if I wasn’t in the car
15-07-2019T18:10:26,IronHorseComics,"you could be in a house watching them come up to your parked car, you could be living next to the park for all we know."
15-07-2019T18:10:28,IronHorseComics,now then
15-07-2019T18:11:08,IronHorseComics,"a good way to be rid of them is to step out of the car, very quickly, shouting as you do so"
15-07-2019T18:11:53,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock: the squirrels did nothing wrong!
15-07-2019T18:14:52,Xexanoth,pet them

15-07-2019T18:27:59,RimaDraws,o/
15-07-2019T18:35:47,IronHorseComics,"got myself an official cover image for the webcomic, gonna be great using it"
15-07-2019T18:40:56,SpazztasticKiwi,y’all I paid for a sprite and a coke zero tumbled out with it
15-07-2019T18:41:28,RimaDraws,oh thats great iron. wow kiwi. extra drink
15-07-2019T18:41:52,IronHorseComics,now that's a score Kiwi
15-07-2019T18:43:31,SpazztasticKiwi,and something I’ve noticed of my turn signals. My left will go click. click. click. click. But the right goes clickclickclickclick
15-07-2019T18:45:52,IronHorseComics,"well that could mean a few things, most likely, either the front right or right rear bulb is burning out. Less likely would be a case of wiring going bad or damaged"
15-07-2019T18:46:16,SpazztasticKiwi,“I believe I will be turning left” vs “MOVEIMTURNINGRIGHTUPHERE”
15-07-2019T18:46:19,Dadrobit,Turn on your signals and get out of the vehicle to check that both are blinking. A fast blinking one could indicate one is burnt or burning out.
15-07-2019T18:47:08,SpazztasticKiwi,nah they’re all blinky
15-07-2019T18:47:14,RimaDraws,lol clickclickclick my old buick did that
15-07-2019T18:47:41,IronHorseComics,has your car been impacted near those lights?
15-07-2019T18:48:08,SpazztasticKiwi,not unless the squirrels are salty I don’t bring em food
15-07-2019T18:49:23,IronHorseComics,"okay so damage is out the window. I would try to have the bulbs replaced, they're cheap but you gotta make sure they're the right ones or else they won't work right"
15-07-2019T18:49:25,SpazztasticKiwi,"other news, the rain is playing red light green light"

15-07-2019T19:28:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheeras generally never minded having things put on him
15-07-2019T19:29:01,AspiringNoodle,*gasp*
15-07-2019T19:29:01,SpazztasticKiwi,He’s already harness trained

15-07-2019T19:29:21,SpazztasticKiwi,and it’s not a full body tux he’d get too hot
15-07-2019T19:29:30,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s just gonna be a collar thing
15-07-2019T19:29:58,SpazztasticKiwi,and maybe a hat if he’ll sit still. Might be glared at but maybe he’ll tolerate it
15-07-2019T19:33:32,IronHorseComics,"just get him a bow tie and a little top hat, he'll be fine"
15-07-2019T19:37:24,RimaDraws,hi tom

15-07-2019T19:44:07,CrRAR,"Sometimes, art is a science!"
15-07-2019T19:46:05,IronHorseComics,"hmmm yes doctor, the subject is responding well to the green paint stimuli, shall we follow it up with a hint of white for the glowing effect?"
15-07-2019T19:46:08,SpazztasticKiwi,ya know maybe a black tie for a black cat might not work out
15-07-2019T19:46:19,IronHorseComics,can't find a red one?
15-07-2019T19:47:04,CrRAR,"That could work, dress him up in Men In Black attire."
15-07-2019T19:47:12,CrRAR,Could be newest recruit.
15-07-2019T19:47:30,CrRAR,Would fit in purrfect at ComicCon.
15-07-2019T19:48:26,CrRAR,It worked for Frank the pug.
15-07-2019T19:49:48,SpazztasticKiwi,ah yes Bagheera at a comicon
15-07-2019T19:50:36,SpazztasticKiwi,doesn’t like small children or other humans taking my attention what could go wrong

15-07-2019T19:56:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d be trying to have a conversation and the poor persons getting the stink eye from the cat on my shoulder
15-07-2019T19:59:00,IronHorseComics,"""Back off bucko, this is MY slave!"""
15-07-2019T19:59:38,RimaDraws,pfft
15-07-2019T19:59:58,IronHorseComics,don't act like it ain't true
15-07-2019T20:01:30,RimaDraws,it is
15-07-2019T20:01:57,SpazztasticKiwi,I have found out he’ll sit in the hood of my You’re Welcome your hoodie
15-07-2019T20:02:02,SpazztasticKiwi,tour
15-07-2019T20:02:51,IronHorseComics,it's gotta be like a little hammock for him
15-07-2019T20:03:06,SpazztasticKiwi,he likes high observance
15-07-2019T20:03:15,SpazztasticKiwi,away from the peasants
15-07-2019T20:06:15,CrRAR,At that height he can stare his adversaries in the face and strike terror into the hearts of his foes~
15-07-2019T20:06:44,CrRAR,:cat:*[mow]
15-07-2019T20:06:57,SpazztasticKiwi,maybe he just hates dirt
15-07-2019T20:07:24,SpazztasticKiwi,he grooms the equivalent of a high school boy with a pocket comb
15-07-2019T20:08:02,SpazztasticKiwi,“How can you get it any more brushed there’s like two inches of it!”
15-07-2019T20:08:30,AspiringNoodle,"Serious question:  how bad is my OCD if I'm worried about, say, $50 of fans lying around from my new computer build.  And that's just a few % of the total cost?"
15-07-2019T20:11:17,CrRAR,Can you send them back because you don't need them?
15-07-2019T20:13:54,AspiringNoodle,Probably not.  The fans I'm talking about will those included either with the case or the CPU cooler
15-07-2019T20:14:05,AspiringNoodle,OCD me wants all fans in the case to be the same :P
15-07-2019T20:14:46,CrRAR,It's a common medical condition this... f-anxiety.
15-07-2019T20:14:50,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-smug:
15-07-2019T20:14:59,AspiringNoodle,"The cooler part isn't *too* bad, because I could just buy one of a few corsair coolers, and it'd come with some fans that I'd like"
15-07-2019T20:15:07,AspiringNoodle,But it's the damn cases man. FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF-
15-07-2019T20:15:32,AspiringNoodle,"Apparently there's no good looking cases that don't come with at least ONE fan.  And most come with 2 - 3, minimum."
15-07-2019T20:15:37,AspiringNoodle,"1 - 2 intake, 1 exhaust."
15-07-2019T20:16:24,CrRAR,"yeah, I always found the fans to be the finishing touch to a computer build, the last obsession to satisfy."
15-07-2019T20:16:59,AspiringNoodle,"I've been thinking about this build for YEARS (yup, obsession problem xD)"
15-07-2019T20:17:34,AspiringNoodle,And it's come to my attention that RGB is a royal mess.
15-07-2019T20:17:58,AspiringNoodle,"It is possible to have 1 RGB software controlling everything, but it severely limits choice"
15-07-2019T20:19:24,AspiringNoodle,"Soooooo, I'm considering foregoing it wherever possible :/"
15-07-2019T20:20:08,CrRAR,Yeah fan control was always a touch/go business I guess the manufacturers just can't collaborate enough to work out a standard.
15-07-2019T20:20:58,AspiringNoodle,"It's even worse than you think, lol"
15-07-2019T20:21:15,AspiringNoodle,Every damn motherboard / gpu manufacturer wants you using THEIR RGB ecosystem
15-07-2019T20:21:40,AspiringNoodle,And they're not compatible with each other unless you starting doing some non-entry level user shenanigans
15-07-2019T20:21:45,CrRAR,I forget what they called it but at one point there was a push to get realtime data from the PSu via a USB jumper or something to the MB.... not sure if that ever came to fruition.
15-07-2019T20:21:59,AspiringNoodle,"Probably not, since I've just now heard about it"
15-07-2019T20:22:14,AspiringNoodle,"So, RGB is absolutely ridiculous"
15-07-2019T20:22:38,CrRAR,"I forget what company it was, I'll have to look it up. Yeah, too many competing ideologies."
15-07-2019T20:23:17,AspiringNoodle,"ASUS Aura Sync, MSI Mystic Light, Gigabyte RGB Fusion, Corsair iCUE (they used to have 2 separate softwares that got merged), AsRock, Thermaltake, etc."
15-07-2019T20:23:51,AspiringNoodle,Corsair is the odd fan manufacturer out.  Other fan makers with aRGB will support at least ONE of the standards (generally Aura Sync)
15-07-2019T20:24:16,AspiringNoodle,"But think about this.  Buy a high-end GPU / MOBO, and it's basically guaranteed to have RGB"
15-07-2019T20:24:30,AspiringNoodle,"But if you want the limit how much RGB software you're running, you better match manufacturers"
15-07-2019T20:24:53,AspiringNoodle,"If you have an MSI / ASUS mobo, and an ASUS / MSI GPU, you're gonna need the software from BOTH companies"
15-07-2019T20:25:44,AspiringNoodle,Suffice to say... I'm kinda pissed off xD
15-07-2019T20:26:16,CrRAR,Yeah if they force brand loyalty their entire product line flourishes.
15-07-2019T20:27:06,CrRAR,"Yeah for us purists, two different apps for the same thing is BLASPHENY!"
15-07-2019T20:27:14,CrRAR,*M
15-07-2019T20:27:24,SpazztasticKiwi,sometimes I wonder why I’ve died in activation here
15-07-2019T20:27:29,SpazztasticKiwi,then I’m reminded
15-07-2019T20:27:55,AspiringNoodle,"TBH, I wouldn't mind going full ASUS.  But two problems"
15-07-2019T20:28:13,AspiringNoodle,1) There are only 2 x570 motherboards with a heatpipe connecting the VRMs and chipset
15-07-2019T20:28:28,AspiringNoodle,"2) ASUS's customer service has apparently been going down hill, with them slowly descending into RMA hell"
15-07-2019T20:29:02,CrRAR,Yeah I was just seeing some bad press about ASUS today.
15-07-2019T20:29:08,AspiringNoodle,Link plz
15-07-2019T20:29:13,AspiringNoodle,"I'm gonna regret asking, lol"
15-07-2019T20:29:17,CrRAR,BIOS/UEFI stuff
15-07-2019T20:29:26,AspiringNoodle,"Oh, pffft, nvm"
15-07-2019T20:29:41,CrRAR,"I saw it on reddit I think, I do not know if I will ever find it again xD"
15-07-2019T20:30:01,CrRAR,It was BIOS quality complaints or something.
15-07-2019T20:30:29,CrRAR,Which I'm not surprised at these days with how foe Intel has thrown manufacturers into a tizzy with security patches.
15-07-2019T20:30:37,CrRAR,*far
15-07-2019T20:31:03,AspiringNoodle,"I'll be honest, I was straight ready to go full Gigabyte this time, lol"
15-07-2019T20:31:24,AspiringNoodle,I LOVE the look of their Aorus GPU (especially with the alternate fan setup)
15-07-2019T20:31:38,CrRAR,I personally have never known ANY MB manufacturer to have good customer service.
15-07-2019T20:31:59,AspiringNoodle,And Steve from Gamers Nexus apparently tested X570 with a gigabyte board and was pleased with Gigabyte / glad he chose them this time around
15-07-2019T20:32:06,CrRAR,A coherent website is the least you can hope for.
15-07-2019T20:32:18,AspiringNoodle,ASUS tends to have a reputation for giving you the run-around
15-07-2019T20:32:34,CrRAR,mmm
15-07-2019T20:32:48,AspiringNoodle,"And before I forget, about those 2 heatpipe mobos"
15-07-2019T20:33:03,AspiringNoodle,1 is the $360 MSI Ace (what I was gonna choose before learning about RGB shenanigans)
15-07-2019T20:33:41,AspiringNoodle,The other is Gigabyte's $700 extreme overclocking board.  Which is the only one that cools the new chipset entirely passively
15-07-2019T20:34:40,CrRAR,"Most motherboards are good, as long as the brand is a recognizable one, I've found over the years that you just get more polish and overclocking focus on the top end ones."
15-07-2019T20:35:05,CrRAR,Yeah if overclocking is a concern it might be worth something more pricey.
15-07-2019T20:35:54,CrRAR,"The modern chipsets should mostly be passive, I'm surprised they're not. Is this Intel or AMD?"
15-07-2019T20:36:27,CrRAR,"I know on the Intel side, more and more has been moved OUT of the northbridge chipset over the years."
15-07-2019T20:36:42,CrRAR,"Hell, the memory controller isn't even in it anymore."
15-07-2019T20:37:11,AspiringNoodle,AMD's moving up to PCIe gen 4.  The chipset is putting out a whopping 15W this time
15-07-2019T20:37:25,AspiringNoodle,"As for overclocking, ironically it's not actually needed, lol"
15-07-2019T20:37:33,CrRAR,nice
15-07-2019T20:37:42,AspiringNoodle,Buildzoid did a rundown on how overkill VRMs are this time around
15-07-2019T20:38:07,CrRAR,voltage regulator modules?
15-07-2019T20:38:09,AspiringNoodle,"Even with LN2 overclocking, you're not gonna nearly push 14+2 phase to its limits"
15-07-2019T20:39:17,CrRAR,"Yeah, CPU voltage/wattage has only become more efficient. You'd think eventually the circuity would diminish."
15-07-2019T20:39:30,AspiringNoodle,He actually joked about it
15-07-2019T20:39:30,CrRAR,Though there's ALWAYS room for

15-07-2019T20:40:02,AspiringNoodle,That said... the ASUS $700 is apparently garbage
15-07-2019T20:40:15,AspiringNoodle,They're asking like an extra $300 - $350 for 3 new things.

15-07-2019T20:40:40,AspiringNoodle,1 of those things being a custom EK waterblock for cooling the VRMs (WHICH WON'T NEED IT BTW)
15-07-2019T20:40:40,SpazztasticKiwi,legit observation. Why do I see so many young men with their pants on their hips but their boxers pulled near to their belly button

15-07-2019T20:43:04,SpazztasticKiwi,at this point I’m not staring because I’m checking them out I’m staring because I’m trying to determine if you got dressed in the dark or somethin
15-07-2019T20:43:35,CrRAR,are they... PLAID!?
15-07-2019T20:43:38,Bgrmystr2,Anyone who properly learned how to dress can dress in the dark.
15-07-2019T20:44:42,SpazztasticKiwi,and don’t get me started on the ones that sag so low they’re advertising they have no boxers on
15-07-2019T20:45:17,SpazztasticKiwi,chafing isn’t fun in my situation I imagine it’s no different for guys
