21-03-2019T01:29:46,DarthRexKing,Bye!
21-03-2019T02:52:57,NibblyBot,New Comic Page: Relaxation Attire http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/1059/
21-03-2019T03:10:48,Bgrmystr2,nice :ok_hand:
21-03-2019T04:46:08,mingun,"@Twokinds Hey, Tom! There's no speechless page :("
21-03-2019T04:52:22,Bgrmystr2,"yes there is, but it broke"
21-03-2019T04:52:28,Bgrmystr2,the speechless page is on 1 now
21-03-2019T04:52:32,Bgrmystr2,instead of the last page
21-03-2019T04:52:44,Bgrmystr2,http://twokindscomic.com/speechless/?p=1
21-03-2019T04:53:17,Bgrmystr2,"Also, the speechless page STILL only contains 536 pages out of the 1059."
21-03-2019T05:02:25,mingun,Last current page (1057) should have number 537? so link should be http://twokindscomic.com/speechless/?p=537? but it doesn’t exists.
21-03-2019T05:03:36,iliar,"No, because not all pages have speechless versions."
21-03-2019T05:04:13,mingun,"Hm, it seems the last page for some reason, just under the number one."
21-03-2019T05:04:56,iliar,This site sorts pages by file name.
21-03-2019T05:05:35,iliar,Last page have filename 1059c.png
21-03-2019T05:06:09,iliar,Other pages have file names YYYYMMDD.ex
21-03-2019T05:06:20,iliar,like 20031022.jpg
21-03-2019T05:06:43,iliar,1059c.png < 20031022.jpg
21-03-2019T05:10:44,Bgrmystr2,well I do hope you know that the speechless versions are not all there because of the fact that it keeps replacing the highest number with the new page instead of actually adding a number for every new page
21-03-2019T05:10:57,Bgrmystr2,so some of the speechless pages are not there anymore
21-03-2019T08:49:46,CommanderTrace,Hello :ctwokinds-nibsdance:

21-03-2019T11:08:37,Twokinds,morning
21-03-2019T11:09:08,iliar,"Good morning, Tom! Thank you for renaming the file."
21-03-2019T11:10:26,iliar,Although I'm interested. Why was the original name 20180105. What is special about this date?
21-03-2019T11:25:18,iliar,"Tom, you are now choosing a new configuration for your computer. Right? Can you give me the configuration you want to buy?"
21-03-2019T11:28:17,iliar,I have long thought that I need a new computer. But choosing a new computer hardware is very boring. Probably buy something like yours will be easier.
21-03-2019T11:48:52,Twokinds,20180105 is a bug in my automated Save Twokinds macro
21-03-2019T11:49:28,Twokinds,It's not supposed to change the filename but I still need to fix it.
21-03-2019T11:55:03,Twokinds,"As for my pc build, here was my goal: https://pcpartpicker.com/list/Ymy6tg"
21-03-2019T11:55:22,Twokinds,Although I was also considering an AMD build: https://pcpartpicker.com/list/3k3rbX

21-03-2019T12:23:58,Twokinds,"Yes, expensive. More than I'd like it to be, but graphic card prices are insane."
21-03-2019T12:25:14,Twokinds,"I already have the case and RAM, both bought on sale."
21-03-2019T12:25:30,Twokinds,Just getting them piece by piece as I find good deals. It'll be built eventually.
21-03-2019T12:25:34,Mippy,:ctwokinds-nibsbounce:
21-03-2019T12:29:32,Azumachan,That's a lot of Ram
21-03-2019T12:31:57,iliar,"I plan spend 1k on PC. But I no needed power supply, video card, so mutch RAM and probable case. To your config will be good for me."
21-03-2019T12:32:02,iliar,Thanks
21-03-2019T12:39:14,Twokinds,No prob!
21-03-2019T12:39:27,Twokinds,I've been doing a lot of computer part research lately for this build.
21-03-2019T12:41:15,Twokinds,"The last time I really got into pc building was 10 years ago, when I built my first one."
21-03-2019T12:47:45,iliar,My previous computer was built in 2006 or something like that. Then I used laptops and was not very interested by PC hardware.
21-03-2019T12:48:04,Azumachan,2013 I think

21-03-2019T20:26:14,FoxxTrotter,"Hi, Zempaii."
21-03-2019T20:26:19,Mihari,mating does mean procreating last I checked
21-03-2019T20:26:33,NezumiYuki,"This brings up an interesting question.  Mi chan, what sorts of canine traits would you find desirable for your speed kitty self?"
21-03-2019T20:27:09,Combak,Only one of those definitely implies kids Mihari.

21-03-2019T20:27:52,Mihari,mating is act of procreating
21-03-2019T20:28:00,Mihari,wether it takes or not is irrelevant
21-03-2019T20:28:59,NezumiYuki,"IDK about you guys, but I prefer the more vulgar term [yiff]   To me it just sounds cuter! :D xD"
21-03-2019T20:29:17,SageSaga,i dont think there is such thing as a inumata? I think its just Nekomata- i know there is an Inugami

21-03-2019T21:02:16,Bgrmystr2,well you can actually turn up and down the bounciness in MMD
21-03-2019T21:02:20,Mihari,I otherwise think it's pretty cool. Able to take 2d images and tween them together rather efficently
21-03-2019T21:02:22,Bgrmystr2,you have control of the whole body lol

21-03-2019T21:20:29,Bgrmystr2,there's not enough movement

21-03-2019T21:21:26,Bgrmystr2,yeah that's a thing as well
21-03-2019T21:21:28,Nekonny,so duming it down may have adverse effects on other animations

21-03-2019T22:45:51,LannAF,"Sticky has been watching Paymoneywubby, when I brought food to her and ate while watching with her, he got over 300 subs in the span of 20 minutes"
21-03-2019T22:46:07,LannAF,Literally every single person in the almost 3k viewer chat have subs now.
21-03-2019T22:46:16,LannAF,I don't even watch him and I have a sub
21-03-2019T22:46:51,LannAF,I'm curious as to how having that many people watching you/hype feels
21-03-2019T22:47:05,MarvTheHugPharaoh,That would freak me out
21-03-2019T22:47:09,LannAF,it's literally just hype building upon itself
21-03-2019T22:47:15,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"""Oh God, PEOPLE!"""
21-03-2019T22:47:19,unsteddyphoenix,"I dont understand most of that but, neat"
21-03-2019T22:47:31,LannAF,You can gift subscriptions to a channel on twitch
21-03-2019T22:47:41,Mippy,:ctwokinds-natanispincycle:
21-03-2019T22:47:45,LannAF,"As in, somebody buys subscriptions, and they are randomely given to viewers"

21-03-2019T22:48:28,LannAF,"Gifting subs? Yeah, I'm not sure it's big enough for that sort of thing to really be a hit"
21-03-2019T22:48:35,Nekonny,Maty!
21-03-2019T22:48:36,Bgrmystr2,"I'm not askin for free emotes, Ord"
21-03-2019T22:48:42,unsteddyphoenix,So someone bought him a buncha subs?
21-03-2019T22:48:51,MrRetroRealm,"Whatcha drawin, Maty?"
21-03-2019T22:48:54,Bgrmystr2,But gifting emotes is something picarto can do and gain even more money
21-03-2019T22:48:56,LannAF,"Well, it started with someone buying 20 subs."
21-03-2019T22:48:58,Mippy,Yum Subs
21-03-2019T22:49:01,LannAF,Then somebody donated 100
21-03-2019T22:49:05,Bgrmystr2,"so I don't see it being a problem of ""how big"""
21-03-2019T22:49:08,ATung231,Hi everyone
21-03-2019T22:49:09,LannAF,Then people started donating a ton

21-03-2019T22:49:25,unsteddyphoenix,Nah thats rose
21-03-2019T22:49:26,True,"Hello, everyone.  Hello and welcome. :v"
21-03-2019T22:49:29,LannAF,I think it was the equivalent of 1.5k dollars in the span of 30 minutes
21-03-2019T22:49:31,Bgrmystr2,"It's nora, clearly"
21-03-2019T22:49:32,LannAF,Heya True

21-03-2019T22:49:36,unsteddyphoenix,"From my extremely bried experience with twitch, that is how it seems to go"
21-03-2019T22:49:38,NezumiYuki,Yep Grim that'd be Raine.  :D   Halfling Raine atm.
21-03-2019T22:49:47,SageSaga,Lann - in a span of 30 minutes i saw a not super popular twitch streamer get over 2000USD and over 100 subscriptions
21-03-2019T22:49:50,unsteddyphoenix,Donation snowball effects seem to be a thing
21-03-2019T22:49:55,LannAF,"Oh yeah, people get crazy on twitch"
21-03-2019T22:50:10,FloofyCat,Twitch is weird. Some 25-30 year old kid from America who screams into a microphone will earn a million monthly consistently.
21-03-2019T22:50:11,LannAF,A lot of the time it's just hype building on itself
21-03-2019T22:50:19,MatyMaty,"for those of you who are coming from my side, remember this stream is strictly SFW! also don't post any links!"
21-03-2019T22:50:19,LannAF,why can't that be me Floofy
21-03-2019T22:50:27,SageSaga,"one person donated 500 dollars twice and another guy said ""No this is how you do it"" 1000USD donation"
21-03-2019T22:50:31,LannAF,LOL
21-03-2019T22:50:32,FloofyCat,People will pay $50+ just to tell some dumbass how to do an extremely simple thing on a game
21-03-2019T22:50:36,LannAF,Shows you
21-03-2019T22:50:50,LannAF,People literally donate just to meme
21-03-2019T22:50:53,LannAF,And Ima be real
21-03-2019T22:50:54,LannAF,It's great.
21-03-2019T22:50:58,unsteddyphoenix,yeah seriously
21-03-2019T22:51:06,LannAF,Because some of the stuff is hilarious
21-03-2019T22:51:15,FloofyCat,"Yeah, I don't really like it because the streamers often act like spoiled brats and they turn it to be, since they go from working 2-3 years to being a millionaire that doesn't know how to boil water."
21-03-2019T22:51:17,LannAF,Meme donations cause more donations
21-03-2019T22:51:22,unsteddyphoenix,"This one dude donated $250 to this one streamer and then said ""ok, im done"""
21-03-2019T22:51:32,LannAF,That's because entertainment Floofy
21-03-2019T22:51:35,unsteddyphoenix,"And I said ""cmon, you might as well make it $300"" in chat"
21-03-2019T22:51:42,FloofyCat,He literally didn't know how to boil water...
21-03-2019T22:51:55,LannAF,That sounds like shite entertainment
21-03-2019T22:51:56,GrimReaperArcher,Fluffy?
21-03-2019T22:51:57,unsteddyphoenix,"And then a few minutes later a donation popped up from him: ""$50, this ones for you unsteddy"""
21-03-2019T22:52:00,swack24,Oh she back being Wulf Girl again!

21-03-2019T22:52:28,Ordithus,"Sage, how many more comic pages can you make it without drawing clothing?"
21-03-2019T22:52:30,LannAF,because he got donated hundreds of dollars
21-03-2019T22:52:32,LannAF,That's funny
21-03-2019T22:52:40,FloofyCat,In before Raine is only acting innocent and has fake wolf ears just to mess with everyone.

21-03-2019T22:53:01,LannAF,What's the hardest type of clothing to draw anyways?
21-03-2019T22:53:02,Ordithus,"Well, that answers my question."
21-03-2019T22:53:03,Ordithus,Haha

21-03-2019T22:53:35,FloofyCat,I'd imagine drawing armour consistently must be a pain
21-03-2019T22:53:39,Bgrmystr2,anything stupidly frilly.
21-03-2019T22:53:44,LannAF,uh

21-03-2019T23:02:32,ScorpDK,"Sekiro shall download on the side, I have time."
21-03-2019T23:03:01,MrRetroRealm,I zoned lol
21-03-2019T23:03:03,unsteddyphoenix,I had never heard of that game before today
21-03-2019T23:03:12,unsteddyphoenix,But now ive heard it mentioned from like 4 different sources
21-03-2019T23:03:14,MrRetroRealm,"Whatcha lining there, Maty?"
21-03-2019T23:03:15,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Its from the people who made dark souls
21-03-2019T23:03:21,BadFoMo,Raine's right leg is Human while her Left leg is Keidran?
21-03-2019T23:03:24,ScorpDK,"It could have been called Tenchu, but they strayed too far, on purppose :P"
21-03-2019T23:03:32,ATung231,Yep.
21-03-2019T23:03:36,MatyMaty,It is more Tenchu than Souls
21-03-2019T23:03:42,NezumiYuki,Wait whut FoMo?
21-03-2019T23:03:48,NezumiYuki,Looks at Raine again*
21-03-2019T23:03:49,Mazinja,Mattey
21-03-2019T23:03:54,unsteddyphoenix,My interest is piqued
21-03-2019T23:03:57,Ordithus,That has got to be weird
21-03-2019T23:03:59,Aimbotexe,When the half'n'half transformation goes wrong
21-03-2019T23:04:03,unsteddyphoenix,I missed the dark souls train but im interested
21-03-2019T23:04:09,Mazinja,It's plenty of Souls x_x
21-03-2019T23:04:11,SageSaga,i loved Tenchu
21-03-2019T23:04:18,MatyMaty,really Maz? :O
21-03-2019T23:04:27,Mazinja,"As in ""it will kick your goddamn ass"""
21-03-2019T23:04:29,MatyMaty,I thought it was more stealth focused
21-03-2019T23:04:38,SageSaga,i also really enjoyed DS
21-03-2019T23:04:39,ATung231,It's tough like Souls and Team Ninja's Nioh.
21-03-2019T23:04:39,Mazinja,"Yes, but you can't stealth everything"
21-03-2019T23:04:49,True,They feared that Tenchu was too niche and with everything they added. They opted for a new IP
21-03-2019T23:04:54,ScorpDK,"I had Tenchu 1 and 2 on the PS1, and 4 and 5 on the PSP. I shall not talk about the Wii game's existence, tho XD"
21-03-2019T23:04:56,LannAF,"Sage, you played the third?"
21-03-2019T23:04:58,ATung231,Especially the boss enemies.
21-03-2019T23:05:03,MatyMaty,"Souls ""stealth"" pretty much comes to ""run very fast"""
21-03-2019T23:05:11,NezumiYuki,"Must fight the urge to reach through her monitor and give the girl Maty is drawing, a gentle squeeze!"
21-03-2019T23:05:18,SageSaga,"DS? I played 1, 2 and 3"
21-03-2019T23:05:22,LannAF,darn
21-03-2019T23:05:24,unsteddyphoenix,gentle? hmm~
21-03-2019T23:05:26,LannAF,I haven't played 3 yet
21-03-2019T23:05:28,Mazinja,"The combat in Sekiro is ""parrying is easy, get good at it or die horribly"""
21-03-2019T23:05:29,LannAF,"Well, barely."
21-03-2019T23:05:30,True,Also with hidden body and cameleon spells
21-03-2019T23:05:31,True,:v
21-03-2019T23:05:32,MarvTheHugPharaoh,3's pretty good
21-03-2019T23:05:39,SageSaga,yeah - i tried to get you to play it with me but you refused
21-03-2019T23:05:48,LannAF,for a time I really didn't feel like it
21-03-2019T23:05:53,ScorpDK,Tenchu is one of the few games where you can skip a bossfight entirely by assassinating them before the cutscene can start.
21-03-2019T23:06:00,unsteddyphoenix,Ok
21-03-2019T23:06:03,unsteddyphoenix,that sounds cool lol
21-03-2019T23:06:17,LannAF,I could never get really into them as much as I did the first one
21-03-2019T23:06:19,LannAF,not sure why.
21-03-2019T23:06:22,Mazinja,"I liked how Tenchu also had an enphasis on ""you don't need to kill anybody but the boss"""
21-03-2019T23:06:24,ATung231,"Or ""No Hit"" like Twitch user ""the_happy_hob"" did. Just 2-3 days ago, he completed Demon Souls, DS 1-3 and Bloodborne back to back without getting hit once."
21-03-2019T23:06:25,ScorpDK,"Tho that came in later games, 1 and 2 still had forced fights."
21-03-2019T23:07:00,ScorpDK,"And yeah. Just bypass most of the grunts, head to where the boss is, finish them. Sneaky!"
21-03-2019T23:07:07,Mazinja,"Anyway, yeah, you can Stealth good in Sekiro and it's pretty fun. Fights are brutal as hell"
21-03-2019T23:07:22,ScorpDK,Nioh+ Difficulty.
21-03-2019T23:07:31,ScorpDK,"Not forgiving at all, but fair."
21-03-2019T23:07:34,True,Nioh was already tough.
21-03-2019T23:07:54,Mazinja,"I had to stop playing after aminiboss dude kicked my ass repeatedly, and when I finally got to him I missed the Deathblow timing :V"
21-03-2019T23:08:00,True,I'm excited for Nioh2 tho
21-03-2019T23:08:02,ScorpDK,Nioh was one of the first games I just...put aside after the 3rd boss battle. XD
21-03-2019T23:08:11,ATung231,Team Ninja did create Ninja Gaiden for Tecmo.
21-03-2019T23:08:23,True,Awwww. It's a fun and good game. XD
21-03-2019T23:08:33,True,I had a blast with it
21-03-2019T23:08:39,ScorpDK,I'll try to get back to it eventually.
21-03-2019T23:08:51,ScorpDK,Just...taking mytime. Like with Dark Souls back in the day.
21-03-2019T23:09:00,ScorpDK,"And God forbid, Demons' Souls :P"
21-03-2019T23:09:04,True,No worries. I believe in youuuuuu!
21-03-2019T23:09:35,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:ctwokinds-nibsbounce:
21-03-2019T23:09:37,unsteddyphoenix,I did the exact same thing with Furi Scorp
21-03-2019T23:09:40,ScorpDK,"""Nice tower. ROLLING BOULDER?! HERE?! WHAT---*dead* ...Okay, let's try this again. Murder skeletons, avoid boulder...this is looking goo---DRAGON!!"""
21-03-2019T23:09:41,unsteddyphoenix,Despite having lots of fun
21-03-2019T23:09:43,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-nibsbounce:
21-03-2019T23:09:56,unsteddyphoenix,The third boss fight just...exhausted me lol
21-03-2019T23:10:18,True,Demon's Souls is not likely to happen
21-03-2019T23:10:20,True,:p
21-03-2019T23:10:22,Herald,Aaaaaah! Maty!
21-03-2019T23:10:27,Aimbotexe,Poofy tail

21-03-2019T23:10:48,ZRO4825,I love the fuck out of Nioh. Sekiro is different.
21-03-2019T23:10:52,Herald,Hope to make the next stream ya do.
21-03-2019T23:11:01,Mazinja,"yeah, Sekiro plays very different from Nioh"
21-03-2019T23:11:03,Ordithus,"Ah, Kaylin is clothed again :ptv-sad:"
21-03-2019T23:11:10,Herald,You also make such beautiful and wonderful work.
21-03-2019T23:11:11,unsteddyphoenix,Sad days ahead Ord
21-03-2019T23:11:13,ATung231,"Cya, Herald."
21-03-2019T23:11:21,ScorpDK,You CAN love Sekiro. But you need to learn one thing: It's unrequited love. Sekiro is not tsundere. Sekiro doesn't care at all.
21-03-2019T23:11:25,Mazinja,the animations in teh game are gorgeous
21-03-2019T23:11:27,Herald,Night!
21-03-2019T23:11:44,True,Sekiro is Kuudere
21-03-2019T23:11:45,True,:v
21-03-2019T23:11:46,ZRO4825,"Yeah. Sekiro just don't give a fuck, lol"

21-03-2019T23:17:24,ScorpDK,"No, just glances at the most recent artworks posted."
21-03-2019T23:17:25,SteelDragonFist,I just got done watching some Bitplex on youtube.
21-03-2019T23:17:33,MatyMaty,Buy 1000 books and Nyna loses the yukata for good :D
21-03-2019T23:17:43,SteelDragonFist,Funny and amazing.
21-03-2019T23:17:47,ScorpDK,"So the current trend seems to be Fat Gay Furries with humongous dicks, dicking each other."
21-03-2019T23:17:47,unsteddyphoenix,Wait for real though?
21-03-2019T23:17:49,unsteddyphoenix,'cause...

21-03-2019T23:18:03,unsteddyphoenix,Oh dislike every aspect of that kink lol
21-03-2019T23:18:06,ScorpDK,[closes FA] Saw enough for a week.
21-03-2019T23:18:16,ATung231,FA can get that way sometimes.
21-03-2019T23:18:19,Mazinja,I suspect furries are gonna be happy with FF14
21-03-2019T23:18:33,Mazinja,since they just announced the Ronzo as a playable race :V
21-03-2019T23:18:50,FloofyCat,"I tried playing FF14, never got into it, music was ace though."
21-03-2019T23:19:01,SteelDragonFist,I haven't sumbited any new art on FA and DA in awhile.
21-03-2019T23:19:06,MarvTheHugPharaoh,She pretty Maty
21-03-2019T23:19:16,Mazinja,"(only male tho, cuz Viera are gonna be only female)"
21-03-2019T23:19:25,unsteddyphoenix,wait what?
21-03-2019T23:19:27,ATung231,"That she is., Marv."
21-03-2019T23:19:30,unsteddyphoenix,Is it set in X universe?
21-03-2019T23:19:34,unsteddyphoenix,Or is there other games with Ronzo
21-03-2019T23:19:35,ScorpDK,Give the new male-only race some strong hallucinogenic drugs. I want to see some high Hrothgars shouting from a mountain and telling me they hear whispers of a voice.
21-03-2019T23:19:35,FloofyCat,*Goes onto FA newest* *Pregnant edits and morbidly obese characters all over* *Closes tab*
21-03-2019T23:19:44,SamuelLeumas,Bahaha!
21-03-2019T23:20:14,ATung231,"I usually attune those out of my vision and mind, Floofy."
21-03-2019T23:20:21,ScorpDK,"What race be that lady, Maty?"
21-03-2019T23:20:28,SamuelLeumas,"Then don't go to dA's 24 hour popular section, that's just as bad"
21-03-2019T23:20:30,Bgrmystr2,let's attune them out of the stream chat too. :)
21-03-2019T23:20:48,MatyMaty,oh she's a lynx :D

21-03-2019T23:21:48,unsteddyphoenix,Love me some ear tufts
21-03-2019T23:22:08,Mazinja,unsteddy: FF14 is it's own thing but they have callbacks to prtety much all games
21-03-2019T23:22:09,ScorpDK,Long Fluffy ears that can flap in the wind when excited.
21-03-2019T23:22:20,True,"It's Anwyn, right?"
21-03-2019T23:22:22,Mazinja,so they just introduced teh Viera (XII) and the Ronzo (X)
21-03-2019T23:22:23,unsteddyphoenix,<3 so cuute~
21-03-2019T23:22:50,BadFoMo,Back.

21-03-2019T23:22:58,unsteddyphoenix,can the ronso steal abilities?
21-03-2019T23:23:05,MatyMaty,"Yup, True!"
21-03-2019T23:23:08,unsteddyphoenix,Lmao Ron
21-03-2019T23:23:09,Mazinja,They are a race not a class :V
21-03-2019T23:23:18,Mazinja,"But Blue Mage is in the game, so..."
21-03-2019T23:23:32,unsteddyphoenix,And Ronsos are blue too...
21-03-2019T23:23:36,unsteddyphoenix,It all adds up
21-03-2019T23:23:45,ScorpDK,Not all of 'em.
21-03-2019T23:23:47,Mazinja,They can be whatever color they want
21-03-2019T23:23:53,unsteddyphoenix,At this point I just wanna finish a drawing marv
21-03-2019T23:23:58,ScorpDK,Just those with a perchant for pushing.
21-03-2019T23:24:03,Mazinja,"they showed off, like, cheetah print and everything"
21-03-2019T23:24:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Teddy how about a deal for sunday.
21-03-2019T23:24:26,Bgrmystr2,lol Tom you can make three panels on the left side and make Raine on the right panel
21-03-2019T23:24:29,ScorpDK,Overly buff cheetah would look really weird.
21-03-2019T23:24:32,Bgrmystr2,instead of having two panels side by side in the middle

21-03-2019T23:51:35,RimaDraws,lol
21-03-2019T23:51:52,Bgrmystr2,"it's probably just.. nothing, starman. Most people don't get the benefit of an initial push"
21-03-2019T23:51:57,Masterzooka,...why is raine wearing the same stuff?
21-03-2019T23:52:02,Doebuns,just drawin cute furries! <3
21-03-2019T23:52:03,Bgrmystr2,it's just a matter of slowly growing the populous
21-03-2019T23:52:15,BadFoMo,That's all she has.
21-03-2019T23:52:16,Bgrmystr2,"word of mouth, basically"
21-03-2019T23:52:21,Masterzooka,shouldnt she be wearing new stuff from the manor or something?

21-03-2019T23:52:43,Ordithus,Raine is too innocent to think of stealing from her hosts it would seem
21-03-2019T23:52:48,ScorpDK,"The initial push, or as some man would have told you in recent years...""JUST...DO IT!"""
21-03-2019T23:52:54,unsteddyphoenix,^
