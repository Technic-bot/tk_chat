13-05-2019T00:01:12,ElvenHunter84,Isn't Keith's name based on some guy you knew in school?
13-05-2019T00:02:57,ElvenHunter84,That could be one of the fun facts
13-05-2019T00:14:59,SpazztasticKiwi,I found my new theme song
13-05-2019T00:44:00,SpazztasticKiwi,So Tom you feelin better or was the doc for just new vaccines

13-05-2019T08:00:19,CrimsonQuill,breathes a sigh of relief.
13-05-2019T08:00:33,CrimsonQuill,"Now, only four other nightmares to overcome."

13-05-2019T12:51:47,CrimsonQuill,I always think about Keith having a British Accent. (Just seen sheet)
13-05-2019T16:34:32,CrimsonQuill,:ptv-victory:
13-05-2019T17:13:43,Bgrmystr2,I don't think anyone in the comic will have any kind of british accent.
13-05-2019T17:14:50,CrimsonQuill,It just works for me.
13-05-2019T17:15:10,CrimsonQuill,I can list all the main characters who have British accents (and some of the minor ones).
13-05-2019T17:15:18,CrimsonQuill,"Also, hullo Bgrmystr"
13-05-2019T17:15:23,CrimsonQuill,:ptv-victory:
13-05-2019T17:16:20,Bgrmystr2,"xD you could say that about anyone just cuz that's all you hear every day. I promise you the world is much, much bigger than that. :P"
13-05-2019T17:17:03,CrimsonQuill,"Roselyn, Euchre, Sirius, Nora, Reni, Alice Reed, all of the Basitins (no exceptions), Saria."
13-05-2019T17:17:19,CrimsonQuill,"I think everyone else has american accents, or some type similar to it."
13-05-2019T17:17:38,CrimsonQuill,"Some accents keep eluding me-always so close, but so out of reach at the same time."
13-05-2019T17:18:01,Bgrmystr2,"need to expand your horizons, mate."
13-05-2019T17:18:18,CrimsonQuill,I just like them the way they are.
13-05-2019T17:18:28,Bgrmystr2,and that's the problem.
13-05-2019T17:18:35,CrimsonQuill,Eric for me started out British but then became American
13-05-2019T17:18:44,CrimsonQuill,A kind of 343 Guilty Spark American
13-05-2019T17:19:15,CrimsonQuill,"Keith was British from the get-go, which REALLY let's me pack the emotion in his voice. I could almost scream out his fears and worries myself."
13-05-2019T17:19:40,CrimsonQuill,And Trace's is kind of a cross between One Punch Man dub Saitama and Nathan Drake.
13-05-2019T17:19:43,Bgrmystr2,that's not how emotions work lol.
13-05-2019T17:19:51,CrimsonQuill,They work for me
13-05-2019T17:20:05,Bgrmystr2,"no no, that's just how you view them, not the same as how it works."
13-05-2019T17:20:26,CrimsonQuill,That's what I meant-they work for me IN MY HEAD.
13-05-2019T17:20:35,CrimsonQuill,If your's are different that's fine.
13-05-2019T17:20:44,CrimsonQuill,I just find it easier to read them that way.
13-05-2019T17:20:53,Bgrmystr2,"Not quite different, but expanded :V"
13-05-2019T17:21:00,CrimsonQuill,Raine's voice is THE hardest to pin down for me.
13-05-2019T17:21:11,CrimsonQuill,I keep trying to find a voice for her personality.
13-05-2019T17:21:29,CrimsonQuill,"It is finally shaping up, but I don't know if it'll ever settle."
13-05-2019T17:21:42,Bgrmystr2,prolly not if you only use two countries as a source
13-05-2019T17:21:48,Bgrmystr2,when there's hundreds
13-05-2019T17:21:59,Bgrmystr2,and 100% of them are irrelevant because Mekkan is not the same.
13-05-2019T17:22:24,CrimsonQuill,"It has elements of Halo's Cortana, Detroit-Become-Human's Kara, Uncharted's Elena, and a host of others."
13-05-2019T17:22:30,CrimsonQuill,All meshing and melding.
13-05-2019T17:23:22,CrimsonQuill,"But when a character's voice comes together-sometimes permanently (Red sounds kinda like a cross between Brendan Fraser and Rocky the Rhode island Red from Chicken Run), sometimes in tiny slivers."
13-05-2019T17:23:28,CrimsonQuill,It's glorious.
13-05-2019T17:23:36,CrimsonQuill,It happens in everything I read.
13-05-2019T17:23:44,CrimsonQuill,Just imagine
13-05-2019T17:24:07,CrimsonQuill,"I know I don't use that many accents, but I haven't really heard that many. I work with what I know.."
13-05-2019T17:24:25,Bgrmystr2,I await the day you find that one single person in a russian or german accent or whatnot and you decide to apply that to 60% of the characters with no basis at all.
13-05-2019T17:24:39,CrimsonQuill,I doubt that'll occur.
13-05-2019T17:24:53,Bgrmystr2,"I don't, considering you're doing it right now already with british accent"
13-05-2019T17:24:53,Bgrmystr2,xD
13-05-2019T17:24:54,CrimsonQuill,I've met hundreds of people with Irish accents and have never once made one sitick.
13-05-2019T17:25:34,CrimsonQuill,I had an Irish accent until I was 8 from my mum...or something along those lines.
13-05-2019T17:25:42,CrimsonQuill,Then I decided to copy my dad.
13-05-2019T17:25:48,CrimsonQuill,And I lost it forever.
13-05-2019T17:25:52,CrimsonQuill,I don't mind.
13-05-2019T17:25:55,Bgrmystr2,likely because it's not different enough to you. so it doesn't matter.
13-05-2019T17:26:00,CrimsonQuill,I like my accent.
13-05-2019T17:26:08,Bgrmystr2,that's fine.
13-05-2019T17:26:18,CrimsonQuill,"To be honest, I just take something and go with it for a bit."
13-05-2019T17:26:39,CrimsonQuill,"Although tomorrow's gonna be study, study, study."
13-05-2019T17:26:56,CrimsonQuill,"I had maths today, which means I have Geospatial on Thursday."
13-05-2019T17:27:01,CrimsonQuill,One Hell down.
13-05-2019T17:27:05,CrimsonQuill,Four to go.
13-05-2019T17:35:28,TerraTheWizard,suddenly talking

13-05-2019T17:43:23,Bgrmystr2,how'd it go?

13-05-2019T17:47:28,Twokinds,XD
13-05-2019T17:47:37,Twokinds,Wanna know when the last time I saw my doctor was?
13-05-2019T17:47:52,CrimsonQuill,I think you said two years ago....?
13-05-2019T17:47:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Early 20s?
13-05-2019T17:48:02,Twokinds,2010.
13-05-2019T17:48:11,SpazztasticKiwi,I was close
13-05-2019T17:48:11,CrimsonQuill,Oh.
13-05-2019T17:48:16,CrimsonQuill,"Make that 9 years,"
13-05-2019T17:48:31,Twokinds,Yeah I had no idea it was that long ago.
13-05-2019T17:48:51,SpazztasticKiwi,I haven’t been for a checkup since graduation
13-05-2019T17:49:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Barely 4 years
13-05-2019T17:49:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also, Tom I got a bone to pick"
13-05-2019T17:49:39,Twokinds,"But my health is the same as always. Blood pressure's the same, weight is the same. So basically I'm great."
13-05-2019T17:49:53,CrimsonQuill,Nice.
13-05-2019T17:49:59,CrimsonQuill,Hale and Hearty!
13-05-2019T17:49:59,SpazztasticKiwi,You say Keith is German. Yet he’s got a British accent
13-05-2019T17:50:08,CrimsonQuill,He has for me.
13-05-2019T17:50:12,Twokinds,He does?
13-05-2019T17:50:13,CrimsonQuill,"Also, Keith is German?"
13-05-2019T17:50:15,CrimsonQuill,Wut?
13-05-2019T17:50:19,CrimsonQuill,Who said that?
13-05-2019T17:50:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Was that not the discussion earlier today. You hadn’t shown yet. Supposedly it’s on the ref sheet
13-05-2019T17:51:34,SpazztasticKiwi,But on the weight thing - this must mean you’ve accomplished the weight you were 9 years ago - that’s bice
13-05-2019T17:51:38,CrimsonQuill,"When I started the comic, I gav Keith a British accent."
13-05-2019T17:51:48,CrimsonQuill,That's why I'm confused.
13-05-2019T17:52:08,CrimsonQuill,"But wow, Tom. You are really in good nick."
13-05-2019T17:52:10,CrimsonQuill,:D
13-05-2019T17:52:34,Bgrmystr2,your accents do not apply to canonical characters XD
13-05-2019T17:52:54,Mippy,Better than me I’d say. Also Keith has a Basitin accent
13-05-2019T17:53:06,Bgrmystr2,"Honestly, I don't see the reference sheet say anything about german lol"
13-05-2019T17:53:11,SpazztasticKiwi,"also, that was best+nice. I know it makes little sense"
13-05-2019T17:53:34,Bgrmystr2,it's not there yeah
13-05-2019T17:53:40,Bgrmystr2,and yeah mippy
13-05-2019T17:53:41,CrimsonQuill,Accents Smaccents.
13-05-2019T17:53:55,Bgrmystr2,it's not something that exists here
13-05-2019T17:53:57,CrimsonQuill,"I have an idea for an accent, someone else has a different idea,"
13-05-2019T17:54:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom joke on the German thing I was pulling on that
13-05-2019T17:54:03,CrimsonQuill,That's ik
13-05-2019T17:54:12,CrimsonQuill,Oh I see Spazz
13-05-2019T17:54:23,CrimsonQuill,I wonder what accents my sister gives the characters?
13-05-2019T17:54:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Twas a funny
13-05-2019T17:54:39,Mippy,You made a funny haha
13-05-2019T17:54:51,CrimsonQuill,Imagine a TK Character with an Scottish or Irish accent.
13-05-2019T17:54:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Just imagine a deadpan hehehehe
13-05-2019T17:54:57,CrimsonQuill,Let the nightmares commence
13-05-2019T17:55:03,Bgrmystr2,"I was there for it, but I don't remember it the same way, but I also don't remember a lot."
13-05-2019T17:55:25,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s bad. Memory loss is for the much older
13-05-2019T17:55:27,Mippy,Scottish or Irish...somehow I’m thinking Daniels
13-05-2019T17:55:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe you need a doc visit
13-05-2019T17:55:51,CrimsonQuill,A
13-05-2019T17:55:59,Mippy,Probably the red hair
13-05-2019T17:56:00,Bgrmystr2,"I literally won't see much any difference, in those three"
13-05-2019T17:56:06,CrimsonQuill,"Oh, God, now all I can think about is two Scots in a lift."
13-05-2019T17:56:09,Bgrmystr2,"very similar, the lot of em"
13-05-2019T17:56:25,CrimsonQuill,And Red haired guy for me sounds American (as you do)
13-05-2019T17:56:42,CrimsonQuill,"I find American accents tricky in my head, but some do suit"
13-05-2019T17:57:09,Bgrmystr2,"lol Kiwi, I tend to not remember conversation statements, more intentions, emotions, images, that kind of thing"
13-05-2019T17:57:46,CrimsonQuill,"@Bgrmystr2 I can barely remember what I was having for breakfast yesterday,"
13-05-2019T17:57:47,Bgrmystr2,"if someone says something, I won't remember what they said a lot of times, but I'll remember basically what they wanted to infer with it"
13-05-2019T17:57:58,Bgrmystr2,"I had waffles yesterday, I got you beat. :)"
13-05-2019T17:58:05,Mippy,I can do a horribly stereotype southern American accent but I don’t understand the rest of what you said Quill
13-05-2019T17:58:07,Bgrmystr2,I have all the waffle.
13-05-2019T17:58:10,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
13-05-2019T17:58:35,CrimsonQuill,"@Mippy I don't think the american accents I think of are all truly ""American""."
13-05-2019T17:59:10,CrimsonQuill,"For example, I can't think of them saying ""cookies"" even when it's printed. "" Biscuits"" just sounds so much better."
13-05-2019T17:59:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh dear Bgr. The amount of teasing I can draw from that
13-05-2019T17:59:28,SpazztasticKiwi,You’re gonna be in trouble if you date
13-05-2019T17:59:46,Mippy,"That is not an accent...that is dialect, Quill."
13-05-2019T18:00:28,CrimsonQuill,"Tom once said Rose has a ""southern"" type accent."
13-05-2019T18:00:40,CrimsonQuill,"My immediete thought was Sussex,"
13-05-2019T18:00:42,SpazztasticKiwi,I can hear a soft southern for her
13-05-2019T18:00:44,CrimsonQuill,West Sussex.
13-05-2019T18:00:47,TerraTheWizard,lmao

13-05-2019T18:01:35,CrimsonQuill,Lots of lovely ducks.
13-05-2019T18:01:43,Bgrmystr2,"lol, kiwi"
13-05-2019T18:01:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Like the older southern lady at church who’s seen and delt with so much bull she no longer raises her voice
13-05-2019T18:01:55,Bgrmystr2,"you say that, but Honestly, the one who is in trouble is them."
13-05-2019T18:02:00,Bgrmystr2,because I take no bullshit.
13-05-2019T18:02:12,Bgrmystr2,"I take shenanigans, it's very different xD"
13-05-2019T18:02:15,Mippy,"Well, when an American says southen I th  ink some swampy hicks in the Deep South. Since “sou"
13-05-2019T18:02:28,Bgrmystr2,"can confirm, mippy"
13-05-2019T18:02:37,Mippy,Since “southern accent” is not really a thing in Canada
13-05-2019T18:02:48,CrimsonQuill,"I wouldn't know what a ""southern accent"" in the US would be like."
13-05-2019T18:03:07,Mippy,Think Cletus from the Simpsons
13-05-2019T18:03:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Similar to what’s his face on the walking dead with the baseball bat
13-05-2019T18:03:09,Bgrmystr2,I thought you were happy with your horizons? :P
13-05-2019T18:03:14,CrimsonQuill,But I could tell you about an Offaly accent.
13-05-2019T18:03:27,CrimsonQuill,Or a Tipperary one.
13-05-2019T18:03:34,SpazztasticKiwi,That accent is real around here. Some are softer
13-05-2019T18:03:38,CrimsonQuill,"Or a Yorkshire or Somerset,"
13-05-2019T18:03:47,SpazztasticKiwi,And some hype up if they get mad
13-05-2019T18:03:56,TerraTheWizard,>somerset

13-05-2019T18:04:24,Bgrmystr2,It's been a while since I heard a solid southern accent honestly
13-05-2019T18:04:27,CrimsonQuill,I've been through the town itself. Nenagh's much nicer though.
13-05-2019T18:04:31,TerraTheWizard,"oh heck, now i'm remembering the accents in dragon quest 11"
13-05-2019T18:04:32,Bgrmystr2,from someone who legit speaks it
13-05-2019T18:04:36,CrimsonQuill,It has a nice second hand bookshop.
13-05-2019T18:04:38,Mippy,Especially if you have to take a ✈️
13-05-2019T18:04:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Go to convention. You’ll hear all the accents
13-05-2019T18:04:45,CrimsonQuill,And an old Norman Tower keep.
13-05-2019T18:04:47,Bgrmystr2,I have
13-05-2019T18:04:55,Bgrmystr2,but it's not really useful
13-05-2019T18:05:05,SpazztasticKiwi,And some different languages. At PAX there’s volunteers that act as translators
13-05-2019T18:05:12,Mippy,"Well, gotta go back to work"

13-05-2019T18:05:42,TerraTheWizard,o/
13-05-2019T18:05:44,Bgrmystr2,"most people here have the orleans ""accent"", they say a few words differently, but the rest is soft and not easy to see"
13-05-2019T18:05:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Anyway it’s great you’re good Tom
13-05-2019T18:06:26,SpazztasticKiwi,"Take a trip through Alabama. If you live, you’ll hear all ranges of south"
13-05-2019T18:07:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Hold on tight to your iq tho. It can feel like it’s slipping if you run into certain people
13-05-2019T18:07:41,Bgrmystr2,"You do know I've lived in the southeastern corner of Georgia before, I've heard it before a bunch of times."
13-05-2019T18:07:42,SpazztasticKiwi,“How much is the 5 for $5 deal?”
13-05-2019T18:07:43,Bgrmystr2,xD
13-05-2019T18:07:59,Bgrmystr2,that's something we get here too
13-05-2019T18:08:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Say that again but slowly. You may figure it out yourself
13-05-2019T18:15:10,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
13-05-2019T18:24:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh and I bought one of those mini roses. It’s either that each or yellow and I won’t know till it blooms
13-05-2019T18:26:02,SpazztasticKiwi,peach or pale orange. Depending on who you ask
13-05-2019T18:31:37,FloofyCat,Wait 5 for $5? I thought America never priced anything including tax
13-05-2019T18:32:09,FloofyCat,Never been so I don't know for sure but I heard nothing costs what it says on the labels because the price doesn't include tax.
13-05-2019T18:34:41,Twokinds,Yeah.
13-05-2019T18:34:59,Twokinds,5 for 5 would actually mean 5+tax usually
13-05-2019T18:35:13,Bgrmystr2,yeah we don't list taxes
13-05-2019T18:35:21,Twokinds,"The only exception is food, and only if you don't eat there."
13-05-2019T18:35:22,Bgrmystr2,"don't ask why, I don't know."
13-05-2019T18:36:12,Twokinds,"Or wait, do they? I don't remember now."
13-05-2019T18:36:18,Twokinds,"But yeah, it's annoying"
13-05-2019T18:36:24,Twokinds,I wish prices were just what was listed.
13-05-2019T18:36:29,Twokinds,Would make using money way easier.
13-05-2019T18:37:11,AspiringNoodle,Some places do use the listed price as the price you pay (tax already included).  I wish it was standard
13-05-2019T18:37:13,FloofyCat,"That's one thing that confused me, if you only wanted to get a few things and wanted to get the exact amount of change its mental maths time."
13-05-2019T18:37:31,AspiringNoodle,"And on top of that, can we scrap the penny already? >_<"
13-05-2019T18:37:49,Twokinds,It was so easy in Korea
13-05-2019T18:38:02,FloofyCat,I don't mind pennies. Use the automatic checkouts and you can dump excess pennies.
13-05-2019T18:38:23,Twokinds,"If something said 1000 won, it was 1000 won. You just give one bill or coin and go on your way."
13-05-2019T18:38:31,Twokinds,So much better.
13-05-2019T18:38:37,Twokinds,"And yes, pennies need to be abolished."
13-05-2019T18:38:40,AspiringNoodle,I hate pennies on a fundamental level.  When it costs 3 cents worth of material to make a 1 cent unit of currency... you've got issues.
13-05-2019T18:38:47,AspiringNoodle,"Quite literally, it has outlasted its spending power."
13-05-2019T18:38:58,Twokinds,"In fact, get rid of nickles too."
13-05-2019T18:39:18,FloofyCat,"I don't even know what a nickle is, is that just 2p?"
13-05-2019T18:39:18,AspiringNoodle,"Yeah, get rid of them both at the same time."
13-05-2019T18:39:23,AspiringNoodle,5 cents
13-05-2019T18:39:32,FloofyCat,Oh.
13-05-2019T18:39:35,AspiringNoodle,"But before long, it might be in the same pool as the penny, costing more to make than it is worth."
13-05-2019T18:39:37,FloofyCat,What do you have anyway?
13-05-2019T18:40:05,FloofyCat,"We got 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1, £2 then notes for £5, £10, £20 and very rarely you never really see them but £50"
13-05-2019T18:40:21,AspiringNoodle,American currency is: 1/5/10/25/50 cent and $1 coins.
13-05-2019T18:40:40,AspiringNoodle,$1/$5/$10/$20/$50/$100 bills
13-05-2019T18:40:47,FloofyCat,"I didn't know you had dollar coins, huh. I thought it was just notes."
13-05-2019T18:40:56,AspiringNoodle,"$2 bills aren't in production, but they're still floating around and still count as valid currency"
13-05-2019T18:41:16,FloofyCat,We've had lots of coins and notes being replaced.
13-05-2019T18:41:31,AspiringNoodle,"There are also larger bills, like $1000, but they're also not in production anymore, which is ironic since inflation would dictate them being necessary later on."
13-05-2019T18:42:27,AspiringNoodle,Some stores are also doing their part to eliminate pennies.  Implementing cash systems that round up / down as necessary so nickels are the smallest increment.
13-05-2019T18:42:35,FloofyCat,Tom where have you been in the world anyway? Just Korea and around the US?
13-05-2019T18:42:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I turned around for two seconds
13-05-2019T18:42:41,AspiringNoodle,"Because seriously, eff pennies."
13-05-2019T18:43:20,FloofyCat,5p seems reasonable to keep though.
13-05-2019T18:44:03,FloofyCat,"Seen plenty chain bakeries that sell stuff for like 85p / 95p, I'd rather managed 5p coins than have it get rounded up and stuff."
13-05-2019T18:44:48,Twokinds,"Outside of the US, I've been to Korea and Germany."
13-05-2019T18:45:20,SpazztasticKiwi,The way I shop I found up while collecting. Usually overshoots the total but I know I’ve got enough
13-05-2019T18:45:23,AspiringNoodle,"This is a long ongoing debate, tbh.  Some people argue we need to keep the penny since Lincoln is the face.  But that's silly because he's also on the $5 bill.  And historically, currency is ALWAYS retired once its spending power is useless."
13-05-2019T18:45:25,SpazztasticKiwi,round
13-05-2019T18:45:32,FloofyCat,"Derp, the only places I've gone that aren't in England is Wales a few times and up into Edinburgh for like half a day. Never left great britain which sucks."
13-05-2019T18:46:47,FloofyCat,"There's a lot of stuff for 99p here, honestly, I don't mind. Whenever I get to the checkout I'll always have something like £12.63 or something and I can just pay £10, two £1 coins, 50p and then dump 13p worth of pennies. It's ten seconds out of my day."
13-05-2019T18:47:15,FloofyCat,I wouldn't mind abolishing it but its not really a priority or anything.
13-05-2019T18:47:30,FloofyCat,Maybe if everyone gives me there pennies I could afford to finally leave the UK lul
13-05-2019T18:48:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Does Paris have $?
13-05-2019T18:49:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Nm. I got google
13-05-2019T18:49:29,AspiringNoodle,I just want the penny dead :p
13-05-2019T18:50:44,Xexanoth,why would a EU country have dollars?
13-05-2019T18:51:16,AspiringNoodle,"I'm trying to get out of politics, but I've heard it's pretty bad in the UK"
13-05-2019T18:51:27,FloofyCat,In what way..?
13-05-2019T18:51:27,SpazztasticKiwi,I ask because I’m throwing recommendations around with someone there and he tossed a dollar amount at me when I was expecting euros
13-05-2019T18:52:00,AspiringNoodle,"Well, to be fair, I should say it's bad in the sense of ""As an American looking at other countries with different cultures"" kind of bad."
13-05-2019T18:52:16,Xexanoth,"oh, i see. If it's for international stuff most people use dollars"
13-05-2019T18:52:28,Xexanoth,"kinda the ""global currency"""
13-05-2019T18:52:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Americans. Think they own everything
13-05-2019T18:52:57,Combak,"Ooh, the Nore ref won? Nice."
13-05-2019T18:53:00,FloofyCat,The EU decided to transition to a single currency shared between countries with completely different economies and it never did too well. It's essentially worth 110% - 115% of a dollar
13-05-2019T18:53:02,AspiringNoodle,"Maybe the richest Americans, haha"
13-05-2019T18:53:02,Xexanoth,not as strong a claim as it used to be but still going strong
13-05-2019T18:54:05,AspiringNoodle,"The global ""standard"" has changed in the past, will change again."
13-05-2019T18:54:08,FloofyCat,"It ain't really too bad here, it's just Brexit, because it got turned into a partisan issue where the left wing was supposed to vote remain and the right ring were supposed to vote leave despite no one actually knowing anything about the EU."
13-05-2019T18:54:28,FloofyCat,They just voted for what their favourite politician said to vote for.
13-05-2019T18:54:32,AspiringNoodle,"I'm more concerned about your liberties, as opposed to Brexit."
13-05-2019T18:54:41,FloofyCat,Or voted the opposite of what their most hated politician votes for.
13-05-2019T18:54:46,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve been following Phil covering that and I’m still lost
13-05-2019T18:54:49,AspiringNoodle,What happened with Count Dankula disturbed me...
13-05-2019T18:55:11,FloofyCat,Oh yeah the Conservatives/Tories are trying their hardest to make you tell the government you want to watch porn.
13-05-2019T18:55:19,Xexanoth,at least political humor got their mileage out of brexit
13-05-2019T18:55:24,Xexanoth,so that's a win i guess
13-05-2019T18:55:28,AspiringNoodle,"Oh God, what have I started"
13-05-2019T18:55:34,AspiringNoodle,Here comes r/Politics xD
13-05-2019T18:55:36,FloofyCat,The pug thing is a Scotland thing
13-05-2019T18:56:00,FloofyCat,"Oh yeah, Brexit the Cat."
13-05-2019T18:56:58,FloofyCat,France's EU minister named her cat 'Brexit' because she meows at the door wanting to go out but then just sits there once the door is opened.
13-05-2019T18:57:18,AspiringNoodle,You're lucky I finished drinking
13-05-2019T18:57:21,AspiringNoodle,Because THAT'S hilarious
13-05-2019T18:58:43,Xexanoth,"i prefered the definition of ""Someones pulling a Brexit"" when someone announces the he's gonna leave the party but then keeps on being there"
13-05-2019T18:58:59,FloofyCat,"So now as a country, everyone in government kinda doesn't want to leave, the people who wanted to leave said they want another vote if they don't win, but now are complaining that people also want another vote, but ignoring that our Prime Minister got"
13-05-2019T18:59:00,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s a southern goodbye
13-05-2019T18:59:09,FloofyCat,got three votes on her Brexit deal?
13-05-2019T18:59:47,FloofyCat,"Who knows we might just delay Brexit another year, then another. Then another..."
13-05-2019T19:00:00,FloofyCat,"Then cancel it, then vote again for it ten years."
13-05-2019T19:00:18,AspiringNoodle,There might be civil conflict before that happens...
13-05-2019T19:00:29,FloofyCat,There will never be civil conflict or anything like that.
13-05-2019T19:00:33,AspiringNoodle,This is the kinda thing that polarizes a populace and can exacerbate tensions.
13-05-2019T19:00:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Have fun. I’ll just sit here sorting the marbles for my plant
13-05-2019T19:00:50,FloofyCat,Marbles for a plant?
13-05-2019T19:01:02,SpazztasticKiwi,For drainage
13-05-2019T19:01:20,FloofyCat,And nah Noodle the only people it will polarise is Gary the 65 year old Kipper who was polarised twenty years ago.
13-05-2019T19:04:06,FloofyCat,"I keep thinking we have it bad in the UK, but then my American friends just remind me that people don't want to throw us in the UK into jail for having abortions."
13-05-2019T19:05:21,AspiringNoodle,"At the same time, we in the US don't want to throw people in jail for making an edgy joke."
13-05-2019T19:05:27,FloofyCat,"Brexit is just going to breeze by, its either going to happen or not happen and the only people who will be polarised are the people who are already so radicalised that they'll be polarised by anything."
13-05-2019T19:05:42,FloofyCat,Jail? It was an £800 fine.
13-05-2019T19:05:52,AspiringNoodle,Give it time
13-05-2019T19:06:19,FloofyCat,Nah it's not going to happen.
13-05-2019T19:06:56,AspiringNoodle,"And if it does, I'll probably never know.  Like I said, I'm trying to drag myself away from this stuff."
13-05-2019T19:08:37,FloofyCat,"Besides, don't feel sorry for Dankula. He raised thousands of pounds and lost eight hundred. He's made more money than he has lost. We definitely got much bigger problems here than someone being fined for training and filming a dog to sieg heil"
13-05-2019T19:09:08,SpazztasticKiwi,The world has made me happier I don’t want children and more convinced in that fact
13-05-2019T19:09:52,FloofyCat,To each their own :p
13-05-2019T19:09:54,AspiringNoodle,I have to agree / disagree.
13-05-2019T19:10:03,AspiringNoodle,You definitely have bigger issues to worry about.
13-05-2019T19:10:27,AspiringNoodle,"But don't be so quick to dismiss things perceived as ""minor"".  They can be a clue to a bigger issue popping up in the future."
13-05-2019T19:12:09,Xexanoth,"then again, nazi stuff in europe is about as edgy as the whole ""black people"" issue in america"
13-05-2019T19:12:36,Xexanoth,if someone had trained their dog to put on a KKK hat and throw a cross into fire the media would have had a field day....
13-05-2019T19:13:01,AspiringNoodle,Don't get me started on US media and statistical manipulation.
13-05-2019T19:13:04,AspiringNoodle,We'll be here all day.
13-05-2019T19:13:19,FloofyCat,Don't get me started on the Conservative government and statistical manipulation...
13-05-2019T19:13:42,AspiringNoodle,"One good thing about college, Statistics I."
13-05-2019T19:14:03,FloofyCat,"Just remember: If you can't succeed, just manipulate statistics so they say you succeed and hope to holy Nora that no one cares enough to look into the statistics."
13-05-2019T19:14:18,AspiringNoodle,I wish Nora was real.  She sounds fun :p
13-05-2019T19:14:25,FloofyCat,Like that moment where the Tories redefined poverty to say they've uplifted more people from poverty.
13-05-2019T19:14:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Where’s Sage when you need him
13-05-2019T19:14:34,Xexanoth,Never trust a statistic you haven't faked yourself
13-05-2019T19:14:43,FloofyCat,Pfffffft ^ That's amazing :p
13-05-2019T19:15:12,FloofyCat,"If Nora existed then every issue relating to gender dysphoria and trans issues in society can be solved and a lot of people could become very happy, if she decided to help."
13-05-2019T19:15:26,AspiringNoodle,I'm amazed more people don't realize how hyperbolic / sensationalized the media is these days.
13-05-2019T19:15:34,AspiringNoodle,That is true <3
13-05-2019T19:15:42,FloofyCat,Who needs HRT and all the complications when your neighbourhood ancient dragon can just magic you to a different sex?
13-05-2019T19:16:09,AspiringNoodle,"And in some cases, to another species"
13-05-2019T19:16:13,AspiringNoodle,*shifty eyes shifty eyes*
13-05-2019T19:16:57,FloofyCat,We don't have any other species but I'm sure making catgirls/Keidran real would end up happening.
13-05-2019T19:17:17,FloofyCat,But as we're humans:
13-05-2019T19:17:27,FloofyCat,Racism 2.0: Electric Boogaloo.
13-05-2019T19:18:02,Bgrmystr2,"I, too, wish Nora were real. In which case, people would realize how wrong they are about mental versus physical traits xD"
13-05-2019T19:18:05,AspiringNoodle,That's pretty much a given subject when it comes to fantasy / sci-fi stories that deal with different races interracting.
13-05-2019T19:18:29,AspiringNoodle,There's always gotta be that ONE race (*cough cough* humans *cough cough*) who see themselves as superior.
13-05-2019T19:18:36,FloofyCat,"Humanity hasn't got past that whole skin colour thing yet, sadly we ain't ready for floofs."
13-05-2019T19:19:08,AspiringNoodle,"If anything, the way the furry community is treated sometimes exemplifies that."
13-05-2019T19:19:35,Bgrmystr2,"yeah well, most of the people that judge based on color are old and will disappear soon. The amount of people they have mislead with their disinformation is far fewer nowadays."
13-05-2019T19:19:57,FloofyCat,"I hope so Bgr, but sadly, those people have raised children to be like them."
13-05-2019T19:19:58,AspiringNoodle,That's not *entirely* true.
13-05-2019T19:20:17,AspiringNoodle,"There's a new breed popping up.  They're racist, just not in the way you expect."
13-05-2019T19:20:24,Bgrmystr2,"yes but that's FAR fewer than such a majority of their generation, Floofy"
13-05-2019T19:20:42,Xexanoth,"eh, most peopel don't really care for furries on way or the other, there's just a loud minority...and a lot of jokes about ourselfs that everyone else on the internet picked up"
13-05-2019T19:20:43,FloofyCat,Yeah true
13-05-2019T19:20:45,AspiringNoodle,"Also dear God, this really has become r/Politics, lol"
13-05-2019T19:21:32,Xexanoth,"we haven't banned people for having a different opinion than a liberal circlejerk, so it's not quite r/politics"
13-05-2019T19:21:45,FloofyCat,"Xexanoth tbh lots of people seem to care online, but they're the edgy people who still call black people the N word, still call people gay as an insult and still call people Jewish as a slur."
13-05-2019T19:22:28,AspiringNoodle,"Soooooo, Eric Cartman?"
13-05-2019T19:22:45,Bgrmystr2,"that dude needs to be the one killed, not kenny"
13-05-2019T19:22:47,FloofyCat,I'd say they're just edgy schoolkids buuuut unfortunately most of them are in their twenties :/
13-05-2019T19:22:58,Xexanoth,"the thing is the ""lots of people"" isn't really that many people, but since the other 99% just says nothing it simply appears to be more"
13-05-2019T19:23:03,Bgrmystr2,he was the worst kid in that show bar none
13-05-2019T19:23:12,FloofyCat,"Well, imagine millions of Eric Cartmans that act the same even into their late twenties."
13-05-2019T19:23:20,AspiringNoodle,Yeah. And I've thought on that quite a bit.
13-05-2019T19:23:21,Xexanoth,aka Incels/Neckbears
13-05-2019T19:23:24,Xexanoth,beards
13-05-2019T19:23:31,AspiringNoodle,But Cartman literally drives the plot like 75% of the time.
13-05-2019T19:23:49,AspiringNoodle,He is *the* catalyst for the majority of the show's conflict.
13-05-2019T19:23:51,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s the name calling and then there’s the go back to your country people. Both exist around here
13-05-2019T19:24:11,SpazztasticKiwi,And they’re not dying in my experience
13-05-2019T19:24:29,Bgrmystr2,"I still don't know the significance of ""neckbeard"" as an insult. sometimes my beard grows on my neck, it doesn't change my intelligence. I think the insult was never good to begin with."
13-05-2019T19:24:38,FloofyCat,"I mean incels as the culture, if you look into it, its urhm... yeah a sight to behold."
13-05-2019T19:24:38,Bgrmystr2,It makes no sense.
13-05-2019T19:25:02,AspiringNoodle,I kinda have a neckbeard.  Kinda because it's nowhere near thick enough to count as a beard.
13-05-2019T19:25:30,Xexanoth,"neckbeards refers to a certain ""culture"" of the internet not an actual physical part(but yeah it started because a lot of these people keep their neckbeards)"
13-05-2019T19:25:34,FloofyCat,"It's more of a stereotype, the focus isn't really the facial hair."
13-05-2019T19:25:38,SpazztasticKiwi,I have no beard. Mwahaha
13-05-2019T19:25:43,FloofyCat,"And what Xexanoth said, it's not just facial hair."
13-05-2019T19:26:31,FloofyCat,I can't explain the stereotype without sounding like a massive douche...
13-05-2019T19:27:02,AspiringNoodle,"As a mid-20-something myself, I wish more people had a live-and-let-live mentality."
13-05-2019T19:27:15,FloofyCat,^ Oh boy would that be nice.
13-05-2019T19:27:34,FloofyCat,Maybe then I can play Rainbow 6 Siege without people teamkilling people because they're women.
13-05-2019T19:28:12,FloofyCat,Anyone who hasn't played that game won't believe how damn prevalent that is either.
13-05-2019T19:28:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Voice change mic. Wonderful things for women
13-05-2019T19:28:30,FloofyCat,I just don't use a microphone
13-05-2019T19:28:31,AspiringNoodle,You know what would be amazing?
13-05-2019T19:28:41,FloofyCat,I never want to and might never use it.
13-05-2019T19:28:48,AspiringNoodle,If friendly fire before enemy contact is made would REFLECT damage.
13-05-2019T19:29:02,FloofyCat,It does now after teamkilling once.
13-05-2019T19:29:17,AspiringNoodle,Sweet.  I haven't played in forever.
13-05-2019T19:29:29,FloofyCat,Unfortuantely you can't remove teamkilling.
13-05-2019T19:29:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m gonna munch while y’all yak
13-05-2019T19:29:40,FloofyCat,What ya' munching?
13-05-2019T19:29:55,SpazztasticKiwi,🌯
13-05-2019T19:30:08,AspiringNoodle,"I'm curious, what kind of computer does everyone have?"
13-05-2019T19:30:11,FloofyCat,... woah I didn't expect an actual picture
13-05-2019T19:30:31,FloofyCat,Urhm... I don't know Noodle :(
13-05-2019T19:30:36,AspiringNoodle,"I plan to build a new one this summer, and I'm hoping it'll be good enough to last 5 - 10 years with minimal part swapping."
13-05-2019T19:30:41,FloofyCat,Different brands
13-05-2019T19:30:55,FloofyCat,Rip your wallet then.
13-05-2019T19:31:13,FloofyCat,Especially with the global shortage of DDR4 RAM.
13-05-2019T19:31:15,AspiringNoodle,"Oh, I know.  I've been saving money for probably 2 years, haha."
13-05-2019T19:31:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Praise be - I’m off tomorrow
13-05-2019T19:32:17,AspiringNoodle,"I'm glad I have been, too.  In terms of CPU, this summer looks to be the best time in a long time."
13-05-2019T19:32:57,AspiringNoodle,"That said, my hardware purchases are probably gonna change ^^;"
13-05-2019T19:33:02,FloofyCat,"Kiwi I just finished uni, I have until the end of this month until I really need to start with job interviews."
13-05-2019T19:33:19,SpazztasticKiwi,What you aiming at
13-05-2019T19:33:28,FloofyCat,"This is the last time in my life until retirement I'm going to have time off with nothing to worry about, and what do I do? Spend that time worrying about stuff :p"
13-05-2019T19:33:54,AspiringNoodle,Spending free time anxious over stuff?  Sounds about right.
13-05-2019T19:33:58,FloofyCat,"I'm not really aiming high, I'm just aiming to get by for a year whilst I plan what to, working in some crummy fast food place or supermarket, whatever I can find."
13-05-2019T19:34:04,FloofyCat,Was hoping to become a teacher though.
13-05-2019T19:34:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I mean what kind of job you aiming at
13-05-2019T19:34:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Ok
13-05-2019T19:34:13,Bgrmystr2,"I've got an older system I built back at the end of 09, still chuggin"
13-05-2019T19:34:15,SpazztasticKiwi,What grade
13-05-2019T19:34:28,Bgrmystr2,:steam_locomotive::railway_car::railway_car:
13-05-2019T19:34:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Choo choo
13-05-2019T19:34:37,FloofyCat,"Urhm well I'm British so secondary school most likely, which is urh... hold on."
13-05-2019T19:34:46,SpazztasticKiwi,We bored Tom to death
13-05-2019T19:34:59,AspiringNoodle,"I went to uni, planned to get into game development.  Started learning about all these horror stories WAAAAAAY too far into my degree..."
13-05-2019T19:35:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Secondary is I think middle schoolish to high
13-05-2019T19:35:15,FloofyCat,Link: Website with a conversion for US to UK school systems hi Ord pls spare me your wrath: http://www.free-for-kids.com/uk-us-education-systems.shtml
13-05-2019T19:35:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah. 9-12. High school
13-05-2019T19:35:46,FloofyCat,So 11 year olds to 18 year olds
13-05-2019T19:35:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Teens and mini adults. Have fun with that
13-05-2019T19:36:05,FloofyCat,Which is all of middle and high school for you
13-05-2019T19:36:15,FloofyCat,Kinda assuming you're American
13-05-2019T19:36:17,AspiringNoodle,"That said, I did / am considering 3d animation.  But given my rediscovery of my favorite webcomics and such, I don't know anymore."
13-05-2019T19:36:23,SpazztasticKiwi,You think?
13-05-2019T19:36:47,AspiringNoodle,"Also, bgr, build mine at the start of 2013.  What kind of build is yours?  Would you consider low-end, mid-range, or high-end?"
13-05-2019T19:36:53,SpazztasticKiwi,If you like animation great. Be prepared for long hours for 2 minutes of movement
13-05-2019T19:37:18,FloofyCat,Have you seen HTTYD? The animation standards are getting higher.
13-05-2019T19:37:36,FloofyCat,Probably an entire 8 hour work day for 5 seconds :p
13-05-2019T19:37:47,AspiringNoodle,"It's worse than that, haha"
13-05-2019T19:37:59,AspiringNoodle,You'll spend an entire week making 4 - 5 seconds of animation
13-05-2019T19:38:13,Bgrmystr2,"Mine was a budget build, I wasn't gonna pay $1000 for some overpriced intel garbage when I can spend $165 for amd and spend $1200 for my whole tower"
13-05-2019T19:38:20,FloofyCat,I guess it depends on who you're working for really
13-05-2019T19:38:27,AspiringNoodle,^ in a nutshell
13-05-2019T19:38:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I considered animation. Might actually decide on it as a minor or try again but I’ve found I’m more for draw
13-05-2019T19:38:57,AspiringNoodle,"Film-grade animation will be a few seconds a week.  If it's lower-quality or meant for DTV, then it could be above 15."
13-05-2019T19:39:05,FloofyCat,I considered animation and wanted to take that for University but I couldn't draw and my A levels (last two years of high school) weren't in the appropriate subjects for animation.
13-05-2019T19:39:05,SpazztasticKiwi,though it’s not realism I go for. It’s calligraphy line art and stylization
13-05-2019T19:39:12,Bgrmystr2,"I've got a Phenom II 955, 10gb of ram right now, but originally had 4gb from Ripjaws, I had a 285, MSI's superpipe OC, now running the 760 Twin Frozr"
13-05-2019T19:39:22,SpazztasticKiwi,I have found I can mimic some fonts by looking at it
13-05-2019T19:39:27,FloofyCat,I also don't like expressing myself creatively so animation would probably have made me drop out.
13-05-2019T19:40:00,Bgrmystr2,"I've had a few upgrades over the years, my cpu is the only thing that I'd have to replace honestly"
13-05-2019T19:40:13,SpazztasticKiwi,I had a stint earlier with clay. Made some stuff. Really it’s just a make stuff thing I have
13-05-2019T19:40:14,FloofyCat,"i7 7700K, 3200MHz 2x8GB RAM, GTX 970, ASUS ROG Z170-F."
13-05-2019T19:40:29,AspiringNoodle,I'm 25 and considering picking up digital art seriously.  Still feel SUPER awkward about it.
13-05-2019T19:40:50,FloofyCat,Noodle just don't expect to be as good as Tom
13-05-2019T19:41:07,FloofyCat,At least until 16 years have passed :p
13-05-2019T19:41:11,Bgrmystr2,"I didn't have money to throw at a bullshit overpriced processor, honestly."
13-05-2019T19:41:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Digital. Eee
13-05-2019T19:41:23,FloofyCat,7700K I got discounted.
13-05-2019T19:41:32,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m convinced photoshop hates me
13-05-2019T19:41:38,FloofyCat,I can't watch 4k blu rays with AMD and really wanted to watch 4k Blu Rays.
13-05-2019T19:41:42,AspiringNoodle,I plan to go double-time if possible.  I want to make up for lost time.  Lost 12 years to WoW and other games.
13-05-2019T19:41:51,Bgrmystr2,it was $165 for the best processor from AMD or $970 for the CHEAPEST intel processor with no cooler attached.
13-05-2019T19:41:58,FloofyCat,I also didn't want AMD because I wanted good single-core performance.
13-05-2019T19:41:58,Bgrmystr2,so.. yeah you can take a guess why I went with AMD
13-05-2019T19:42:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Lost 12 years. You’re still in your 20s
13-05-2019T19:42:12,SpazztasticKiwi,you’re not dying
13-05-2019T19:42:19,FloofyCat,I play a game a lot that only works with one core so AMD wouldn't have been an upgrade for me.
13-05-2019T19:42:22,AspiringNoodle,"i5-3570k, 1600 DDR3 32GB (lots of birthday / christmas gifts xD), gtx 970."
13-05-2019T19:42:33,FloofyCat,I had a 3570k Noodle! That's in my old tower!
13-05-2019T19:42:48,FloofyCat,3570K represent! \o/
13-05-2019T19:42:48,Bgrmystr2,I have lots of games that still run fine on this AMD processor I have
13-05-2019T19:42:57,Bgrmystr2,so I mean.. I don't really know?
13-05-2019T19:43:14,FloofyCat,"Kiwi, similar here."
13-05-2019T19:43:20,FloofyCat,Photoshop is a weird mistress.
13-05-2019T19:43:31,AspiringNoodle,"I'm pushing my 3570k as far as it can go with what I have.  My next build will be MUCH more expensive than this one, but at the same time I won't be making the same mistakes."
13-05-2019T19:43:59,FloofyCat,Once it decided that my tablet should only draw in zigzags because I had the grid overlay which took 4 hours to figure out rolling back through Wacom drivers.
13-05-2019T19:44:12,AspiringNoodle,Ouch xD
13-05-2019T19:44:29,FloofyCat,Then for some reason my default colour profile turned everything dark as hell - like someone put a bad HDR filter over it.
13-05-2019T19:44:50,FloofyCat,"Now I have to convert the colour profile of all my old photoshop files. I don't understand what, why or how any of this is doing what it is doing."
13-05-2019T19:44:57,Bgrmystr2,"I'm gonna wait till Ryzen 3000 comes out before I upgrade, honestly."
13-05-2019T19:45:00,AspiringNoodle,^
13-05-2019T19:45:01,SpazztasticKiwi,My laptop once got swapped to external mic mode
13-05-2019T19:45:10,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t have an external mic
13-05-2019T19:45:13,FloofyCat,Oh gosh
13-05-2019T19:45:19,AspiringNoodle,That's the big reason I'm happy it's taken so long to get the funds together.  Zen 2 looks to be THE upgrade of the decade.
13-05-2019T19:45:30,FloofyCat,My sound card has a mic which isn't a mic but is my audio output as a mic.
13-05-2019T19:45:34,Bgrmystr2,"I already know AMD is gonna mop the floor with Intel, just wanna see how much they do, and what CPU is the best value"
13-05-2019T19:45:39,FloofyCat,... Sometimes it decides to turn itself on.
13-05-2019T19:45:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Took a few days to figure out what the hell it was doing and swap it
13-05-2019T19:46:05,AspiringNoodle,I'm hoping that the 8-core processor is cheap :)
13-05-2019T19:46:28,AspiringNoodle,"If I want to go 2d digital as opposed to 3d animation, I'm gonna need a lot more storage."
13-05-2019T19:46:33,FloofyCat,"Bgr AMD are mopping the floor in certain ways, Intel mops the floor in certain other ways."
13-05-2019T19:46:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Now I no longer have the can you hear me now problem with my laptop
13-05-2019T19:46:40,Bgrmystr2,"only right now, Floofy"
13-05-2019T19:46:45,AspiringNoodle,^
13-05-2019T19:46:55,AspiringNoodle,Zen 2 will potentially remove Intel's claim to fame.
13-05-2019T19:47:03,AspiringNoodle,Aka: Best single thread performance / highest clock rates.
13-05-2019T19:47:06,Bgrmystr2,"The 8core engineering sample went toe-to-toe with intel's 9900k, I can't wait for the final release."
13-05-2019T19:47:18,FloofyCat,"Sure, it might but its not going to last forever."
13-05-2019T19:47:19,AspiringNoodle,AND it will be cheaper AND offer more cores.
13-05-2019T19:47:19,Bgrmystr2,and intel has NOTHING better than that for consumers right now
13-05-2019T19:47:23,Bgrmystr2,literally nothing
13-05-2019T19:47:24,FloofyCat,They've been battling forever.
13-05-2019T19:47:38,AspiringNoodle,Intel has supply issues.  And they're having trouble getting 10nm up and running.
13-05-2019T19:47:53,FloofyCat,"Besides, Intel still owns the license to x86."
13-05-2019T19:48:30,FloofyCat,Its lease to AMD could always change terms.
13-05-2019T19:48:57,AspiringNoodle,Couldn't that potentially run afowl of legislation?
13-05-2019T19:49:00,Bgrmystr2,"the 9900k is their cream of the crop for consumers, they have nothing bigger than that besides server cores. AMD on the other hand has the 8core that can compete with the 9900k, a 12core, and a 16core. Not to mention the rumored 32 and 64 core server proc"
13-05-2019T19:49:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I hope there’s no test after this
13-05-2019T19:49:19,AspiringNoodle,"""We don't like the competition, therefore we make it impossible for them to sell their products, even though they abide by universal standards"""
13-05-2019T19:49:42,FloofyCat,Bgr most of the people who buy this stuff buy it for gaming?
13-05-2019T19:49:54,FloofyCat,Games don't use 12 or 16 cores.
13-05-2019T19:50:00,AspiringNoodle,Yet ;)
13-05-2019T19:50:01,FloofyCat,They usually never use over 4.
13-05-2019T19:50:10,AspiringNoodle,That's also changing
13-05-2019T19:50:15,FloofyCat,And I doubt they'll use over 4 for a good 30+ years
13-05-2019T19:50:25,Bgrmystr2,"AMD is going to flatten intel with the 3000 series release. Unless intel comes out with something better than the 9900k, they're not going to beat amd. and you'd actually be wrong"
13-05-2019T19:50:43,AspiringNoodle,"Programmers typically follow the hardware, not the other way around."
13-05-2019T19:51:01,AspiringNoodle,"If the hardware standard is 4c/8t, then they'll program to leverage that at most."
13-05-2019T19:51:08,Bgrmystr2,"most games now can take into account multiple cores and multiple threads way better than they did before, and to top that off, AMD is looking to actually beat intel on the single core score as well with the 3000 series."
13-05-2019T19:51:15,SpazztasticKiwi,yt is calling knock yourselves out
13-05-2019T19:51:21,AspiringNoodle,Have fun!
13-05-2019T19:51:43,Bgrmystr2,Intel is the one trying to keep everyone at 4 cores and 8 threads. that's how they get money. Keeping the status quo instead of improving technology
13-05-2019T19:51:48,AspiringNoodle,^
13-05-2019T19:51:55,FloofyCat,Oh apparently some games have started to move beyond 4
13-05-2019T19:52:11,AspiringNoodle,They held a market monopoly for 10 years.  They took their sweet-@$$ time releasing improvements because that's the most profitable route.
13-05-2019T19:52:27,Bgrmystr2,AMD is pushing boundaries. They're likely going to beat intel on both single core performance and raw multi core performance too.
13-05-2019T19:52:29,AspiringNoodle,"And now that Zen's out, AMD's rolling in money, and they're not slowing down on innovation, Intel got caught with their pants down."
13-05-2019T19:52:41,Bgrmystr2,"That's the whole idea behind Ryzen 3000, that's why it's so big."
13-05-2019T19:52:53,AspiringNoodle,Ashes of the Singularity is general considered THE benchmark for multicore
13-05-2019T19:52:59,AspiringNoodle,Can take advantage of 8 cores
13-05-2019T19:53:32,AspiringNoodle,"Funny enough, this whole clash between Intel and AMD goes back to their fundamental beliefs."
13-05-2019T19:53:45,AspiringNoodle,"Intel always believed single-core performance was the way to go, AMD with multi-core."
13-05-2019T19:54:04,AspiringNoodle,"At one point in the past, somebody from Intel believed we'd have 10Ghz processors by either 2012 or 2013."
13-05-2019T19:54:33,Bgrmystr2,"even though some games don't take advantage of multi cores, they still CAN use multiple cores to improve performance. And to that aspect, AMD is correct. Multiple cores and multiple threads is the future. Don't put all your eggs in one basket as they say."
13-05-2019T19:54:41,AspiringNoodle,^
13-05-2019T19:54:44,Bgrmystr2,"Intel did just that, and look where they are now. Falling behind."
13-05-2019T19:54:54,FloofyCat,Also consider you aren't going to get full utilisation ofr 8+cores until everyone starts having 8+ cores.
13-05-2019T19:55:08,Bgrmystr2,We are that transition right now Floofy
13-05-2019T19:55:11,AspiringNoodle,"Early adopter's fee, as they say :)"
13-05-2019T19:55:23,Bgrmystr2,"with the advent of AMD's Ryzen processors, that's exactly what AMD is changing."
13-05-2019T19:55:24,FloofyCat,"Not really, Intel is still big."
13-05-2019T19:55:26,FloofyCat,Give it ten years.
13-05-2019T19:55:34,AspiringNoodle,Intel's already behind
13-05-2019T19:55:38,AspiringNoodle,Zen outsells them 2:1
13-05-2019T19:55:44,Bgrmystr2,"You say that, but have you bothered to look at the sales numbers bro?"
13-05-2019T19:55:55,AspiringNoodle,AMD is starting to snag OEM contracts
13-05-2019T19:56:01,FloofyCat,"Urhm... Bgr, people don't buy new CPUs every year."
13-05-2019T19:56:15,Bgrmystr2,AMD is mopping the floor with Intel for sales.
13-05-2019T19:56:23,FloofyCat,In about 5 or 6 years what everyone has will start to become obsolete.
13-05-2019T19:56:32,Bgrmystr2,And yeah look at the sales dude. You obviously haven't seen them. xD
13-05-2019T19:56:35,FloofyCat,"At that point if AMD is still leagues ahead, people will start upgrad..."
13-05-2019T19:56:42,FloofyCat,Bgr are you even reading what I'm saying..?
13-05-2019T19:57:16,AspiringNoodle,"The tides are shifting, like right now."
13-05-2019T19:57:27,Bgrmystr2,"https://www.extremetech.com/computing/281741-new-retail-data-shows-amd-outselling-intel-21 People don't buy new CPUs every year, no, but there's a FUCKTON of people who buy CPUs every few years. And they allllllllllllll overlap."
13-05-2019T19:57:47,Bgrmystr2,"AMD is destroying, and it will only get worse for intel."
13-05-2019T19:57:54,AspiringNoodle,*That moment when you throw out a statistic and someone else links an article verifying it*
13-05-2019T19:57:55,FloofyCat,"Yeah, so give it 5-10 years Bgr and Noodle. Then everyone will be using AMD if they stay ahead."
13-05-2019T19:58:13,FloofyCat,Noodle read lol
13-05-2019T19:58:29,Bgrmystr2,5-10 years? Please. I give it two probably.
13-05-2019T19:58:35,FloofyCat,Eeehhhh
13-05-2019T19:58:49,FloofyCat,Games don't depend on CPUs that much.
13-05-2019T19:58:54,AspiringNoodle,"The problem is right here and now.  Intel is way more expensive than AMD, something like 70% more for 10 - 20% more performance.  And on top of that they're having trouble keeping inventory."
13-05-2019T19:58:56,FloofyCat,I'd say give it two years if you're on about GPUs.
13-05-2019T19:59:15,Bgrmystr2,"The thing is gaming is a very VERY small portion of processor sales, Floofy. That's fact."
13-05-2019T19:59:21,FloofyCat,Maybe for the simulator market of games that rely heavily on CPUs?
13-05-2019T19:59:31,FloofyCat,Urhm...
13-05-2019T19:59:45,FloofyCat,Most processor sales aren't for generic office PCs?
13-05-2019T19:59:54,FloofyCat,I meant are for generic office PCs*
13-05-2019T20:00:00,AspiringNoodle,AMD's changing that :)
13-05-2019T20:00:06,AspiringNoodle,"Snag the OEMs, you snag the offices."
13-05-2019T20:00:10,FloofyCat,Urh... no people are still buying generic office PCs
13-05-2019T20:00:22,FloofyCat,They won't have Ryzens or Threadrippers?
13-05-2019T20:00:29,Bgrmystr2,"Gaming is big, but the HUGE majority of sales are for commercial office space and industrial use."
13-05-2019T20:00:48,Bgrmystr2,gaming is so small in comparison
13-05-2019T20:00:52,FloofyCat,Idk why you're bringing up generic office computers when arguing about top-of-the-line CPUs?
13-05-2019T20:01:09,AspiringNoodle,"I did say earlier that AMD is snagging OEM contracts, didn't I?"
13-05-2019T20:01:24,AspiringNoodle,"Seriously, I can't remember if I mentioned that."
13-05-2019T20:01:24,FloofyCat,Suuuuureee but that has little relevance to gaming?
13-05-2019T20:01:43,FloofyCat,Idk dude. I'm not throwing my CPU out after two years.
13-05-2019T20:01:56,FloofyCat,It's going to last a good 5 before it becomes obsolete.
13-05-2019T20:02:10,AspiringNoodle,I may be using the wrong term.  What I meant to say was that AMD is snagging contracts with prebuilts
13-05-2019T20:02:21,Bgrmystr2,"It's going to probably be obsolete later this year when AMD releases ryzen 3000, I'm just sayin."
13-05-2019T20:02:28,FloofyCat,... No its not Bgr?
13-05-2019T20:02:35,FloofyCat,What year is this
13-05-2019T20:02:37,AspiringNoodle,"Ryzen 3000 is going to make Ryzen 2000 obsolete, lol"
13-05-2019T20:02:41,FloofyCat,Is Battlefield 9 coming out?
13-05-2019T20:02:46,FloofyCat,With 1000 AI in a single map?
13-05-2019T20:02:58,FloofyCat,Obsolete doesn't mean it has a single successor Noodle?
13-05-2019T20:03:10,FloofyCat,Obsolete means its useless.
13-05-2019T20:03:20,AspiringNoodle,Zen 2 (aka Ryzen 3000) is gonna be a HUGE jump ahead of Zen 2.
13-05-2019T20:03:20,Bgrmystr2,"we're 2019, and this is the year the new line of AMD processors come out, mate. If you're not watching, you're gonna fall behind."
13-05-2019T20:03:33,Bgrmystr2,"Zen+ you mean, noodle lol"
13-05-2019T20:03:45,AspiringNoodle,^ *facepalm*
13-05-2019T20:03:55,FloofyCat,Do you two believe that the CPUs everyone have atm will become 100% useless for gaming within two years..?
13-05-2019T20:03:57,Bgrmystr2,Zen+ is what the 2000 series is
13-05-2019T20:03:58,FloofyCat,like what
13-05-2019T20:04:16,AspiringNoodle,We're talking more about a shift in term of what's actually worth your money.
13-05-2019T20:04:28,FloofyCat,I'm not?
13-05-2019T20:04:37,Bgrmystr2,"no, Floofy, we just do not believe that intel will have anything worth of value by the end of this year, or perhaps next year."
13-05-2019T20:04:46,FloofyCat,"If you're on about the best value for performance sure, AMD probably have taken over half a year ago already?"
13-05-2019T20:04:50,AspiringNoodle,Zen atm is still more of a value per $ winner.  While Intel still holds the mantle of performance king.
13-05-2019T20:04:52,Bgrmystr2,There won't be anything worth buying on the intel side of the CPU market
13-05-2019T20:05:04,Bgrmystr2,on any end.
13-05-2019T20:05:13,Bgrmystr2,"low end, mid, high, server, doesn't matter"
13-05-2019T20:05:15,FloofyCat,Yeah Bgr but the effects of this aren't going to be seen for a while.
13-05-2019T20:05:29,FloofyCat,Because people who currently have Intel and AMD high end aren't going to upgrade for a while.
13-05-2019T20:05:32,FloofyCat,Because there's no need to.
13-05-2019T20:05:32,Bgrmystr2,It doesn't take as long as you think it does.
13-05-2019T20:05:55,FloofyCat,What we have atm will still work for games for a long time.
13-05-2019T20:06:00,AspiringNoodle,Think of it this way.  Every year a lot of people buy new computers or build them.
13-05-2019T20:06:12,AspiringNoodle,The smart ones do the research or ask their tech savvy friends.
13-05-2019T20:06:18,FloofyCat,Yeah but not the the entire population of gamers? o_O
13-05-2019T20:06:28,Bgrmystr2,You're only thinking it takes a long time because that's how it's been for intel. The whole idea was to just keep people buying expensive miniscule upgrades every few years.
13-05-2019T20:06:30,AspiringNoodle,"Those are the fanboys, and they're stupid :p"
13-05-2019T20:06:51,FloofyCat,Guys you aren't going to see everyone buying a Threadripper or Ryzen next year
13-05-2019T20:07:06,AspiringNoodle,Of course not.  Just a single year's worth of people.
13-05-2019T20:07:07,FloofyCat,People don't have that much money to waste when they have CPUs that are already more than good enough
13-05-2019T20:07:18,AspiringNoodle,"Who will then tell their friends, peers, loved ones that AMD is a better deal."
13-05-2019T20:07:23,FloofyCat,"If they still have a 3570K like I had, sure, I might buy a new AMD one."
13-05-2019T20:07:30,AspiringNoodle,Who will then buy AMD when they build or buy their next system.
13-05-2019T20:07:33,AspiringNoodle,And so on and so forth
13-05-2019T20:08:22,FloofyCat,"Yeah Noodle, by the time everyone has rebuilt there PCs, its going to be a good 5 years."
13-05-2019T20:08:37,AspiringNoodle,And given how Intel's responded to AMD... I'll stick to my guns.
13-05-2019T20:08:54,AspiringNoodle,Intel's fallen flat on their face every step of the way ever since Ryzen first launched back in 2017
13-05-2019T20:09:05,FloofyCat,I feel like you're arguing against something I'm not even talking about.
13-05-2019T20:09:18,FloofyCat,Noodle you're just telling me things I'm not even denying
13-05-2019T20:09:35,AspiringNoodle,Our arguments are more or less how fast the market is going to shift.
13-05-2019T20:10:02,FloofyCat,"I'm literally saying that 8+ cores being utilised in games is not going to happen until the majority of gamers have transitioned to CPUs with 8+ cores, which will take longer than two years."
13-05-2019T20:10:04,Bgrmystr2,"the market is a river, it flows depending on what happens. It has no rhyme or reason, nor any natural time."
13-05-2019T20:10:29,AspiringNoodle,"To be fair, that argument ignores the latest generation of intel."
13-05-2019T20:10:37,FloofyCat,Bgr people don't buy new CPUs when their current one is good enough.
13-05-2019T20:10:41,Bgrmystr2,"Floofy, you may need to pay attention to the market more then."
13-05-2019T20:10:45,FloofyCat,Again
13-05-2019T20:10:46,FloofyCat,Bgr
13-05-2019T20:10:54,FloofyCat,People don't replace their CPUs until their current CPU isn't good enough.
13-05-2019T20:11:02,FloofyCat,Not unless they're really damn rich.
13-05-2019T20:11:16,AspiringNoodle,"From what I've read, average CPU replacement is 3 - 5 years."
13-05-2019T20:11:28,AspiringNoodle,GPU is 1.5 - 3.
13-05-2019T20:11:28,FloofyCat,"And even then, very few people actually buy the hyper-expensive state of the art stuff."
13-05-2019T20:11:38,Bgrmystr2,"You say that like it has any relevance. Also, just because you say it doesn't mean it's true. People DO replace their CPUs to newer and more powerful processors even if what they have is good enough."
13-05-2019T20:11:43,FloofyCat,Yeah so what are you saying two years then if iti s 3-5 years?
13-05-2019T20:12:21,AspiringNoodle,"Because back in 2017, AMD was offering 8 core processors for $300 - $400 when Intel was asking $1000 :)"
13-05-2019T20:13:10,FloofyCat,Urhm... people not everyone upgraded in 2017 Noodle?
13-05-2019T20:13:15,Bgrmystr2,"Think of this, Floofy. If you sell your 9900k for like $900 and then buy a 12 core AMD processor that outstrips it for $400, you have a better processor and extra money."
13-05-2019T20:13:24,Bgrmystr2,That's a very common practice.
13-05-2019T20:13:32,AspiringNoodle,"The ""everyone"" part of your argument is not exactly helping."
13-05-2019T20:13:34,FloofyCat,Someone has to buy it for $900.
13-05-2019T20:13:41,Bgrmystr2,of course someone will buy it.
13-05-2019T20:14:05,AspiringNoodle,We're 2 years into AMD retaking large sections of the market.  And their innovation is continuing full steam ahead.
13-05-2019T20:14:07,Bgrmystr2,The people who buy it are those who won't leave intel no matter what AMD is doing because they've already dug their head in the sand
13-05-2019T20:14:15,FloofyCat,"I don't know if you realise that if you optimise a game to run on 8 cores, when someone with 4 cores comes along, you start to have problems."
13-05-2019T20:14:23,AspiringNoodle,Meanwhile Intel is falling flat on their face and floundering trying to come up with a response.
13-05-2019T20:14:49,FloofyCat,You'll maybe get widespread optimisation for 8 core CPUs within a few years from Triple A games at the most.
13-05-2019T20:15:20,FloofyCat,Even then it's going to be limited for a while
13-05-2019T20:15:24,Bgrmystr2,"You don't optimize a game to run on 8 cores, you optimize it to run on simultanious threads versus a single thread. the amount of cores is not really relevant in that aspect."
13-05-2019T20:15:35,AspiringNoodle,^
13-05-2019T20:15:49,Bgrmystr2,"8 cores is just an arbitrary number, not something set in stone."
13-05-2019T20:16:24,Bgrmystr2,"Just because 8 cores is the highest that Intel has on the market doesn't mean that's the highest core count a game can utilize, nor is it what it was coded for in the first place."
13-05-2019T20:16:43,AspiringNoodle,Think of multi-core as performance left on the table finally being taken.
13-05-2019T20:17:15,AspiringNoodle,"If a game can utilize 8 cores / threads, but you have 4 cores / threads, you may not be running at peak efficiency, but your performance will still be VERY acceptable."
13-05-2019T20:17:29,TheGamePlayer,Good afternoo!
13-05-2019T20:17:35,TheGamePlayer,*noon
13-05-2019T20:17:47,AspiringNoodle,If your game runs at half the performance as the 8 core... then the developers have some serious optimizations to do.
13-05-2019T20:18:07,Bgrmystr2,"Also, if a game can utilize 8 cores, it can just as easily utilize 12 or 16 cores. It just uses more threads to get the job done."
13-05-2019T20:18:16,Bgrmystr2,Heya gameplayer.
13-05-2019T20:18:33,TheGamePlayer,I passed my road test this morning and I feel great!
13-05-2019T20:18:36,AspiringNoodle,"More often than not, the number of cores / threads a game utilizes squeezes out major diminishing returns."
13-05-2019T20:19:20,Bgrmystr2,"Supreme Commander is a great example of a game that relies majority on single thread performance rather than multi-thread performance, and it, too, improves gameplay when you have more cores and threads per processor."
13-05-2019T20:19:41,Bgrmystr2,"It's not efficient at it, of course, but that's exactly why it's a great example."
13-05-2019T20:21:12,AspiringNoodle,Long story short: Intel in trouble.
13-05-2019T20:21:22,Bgrmystr2,Games have been going towards multi-threaded usage since the early 2010s
13-05-2019T20:21:30,Bgrmystr2,we're 9 years later.
13-05-2019T20:21:35,AspiringNoodle,"Everyone in the tech community know it, and that information disseminates from them to friends / family"
13-05-2019T20:21:46,AspiringNoodle,I think Watchdogs 2 is a game that benefits up to 8 cores.
13-05-2019T20:21:47,FloofyCat,Bgr and Noodle: https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/Steam-Hardware-Software-Survey-Welcome-to-Steam
13-05-2019T20:22:24,FloofyCat,"April 2019, 2.47% have 8 cores."
13-05-2019T20:23:01,FloofyCat,That's 2% higher from 0.47% from June 2017.
13-05-2019T20:23:47,AspiringNoodle,And so it's begun >:3
13-05-2019T20:23:52,Bgrmystr2,">Participation in the survey is optional, and anonymous. Most people worth their computer usage aren't going to use something like that."
13-05-2019T20:24:06,FloofyCat,The giant transition to hyper-expensive CPUs that cost a month of rent isn't going so fast.
13-05-2019T20:24:15,AspiringNoodle,That's where it gets interesting.
13-05-2019T20:24:43,FloofyCat,"Yeah Bgr I know, millions click the ""yes"" button and do it."
13-05-2019T20:24:49,AspiringNoodle,Speculation has it that Zen 2 will feature 16 core processors in its lineup.  Rumor puts the 16-core at $500 (take that with a Dead Sea of salt)
13-05-2019T20:24:56,FloofyCat,This isn't a ten person sample lol.
13-05-2019T20:25:35,FloofyCat,"Yeah I still don't think the majority of gamers going to have this for a while, solely because it's incredibly expensive."
13-05-2019T20:25:45,Bgrmystr2,"you'd be surprised. Steam may not be small, but it's hardly a drop in the bucket compared to larger sales numbers that AMD is going to dominate in the coming years."
13-05-2019T20:25:45,AspiringNoodle,But here's something worth pointing out:  6-core cpus up 4.4% from december to 13.4%
13-05-2019T20:26:15,AspiringNoodle,Intel's 8700k is a 6-core.  And AMD's 6-core processors are in the low-mid $200 range.
13-05-2019T20:26:39,FloofyCat,That is something worth pointing out yeah
13-05-2019T20:27:16,FloofyCat,"But yeah again, I don't think you're going to see market domination by core counts of 8 and above for a while because the new 12, 14, 16+ core CPUs aren't going to be commonplace for a while."
13-05-2019T20:27:37,AspiringNoodle,That's assuming pricepoints remain the same.
13-05-2019T20:27:40,FloofyCat,"These CPUs are coming out now, at high prices."
13-05-2019T20:27:48,FloofyCat,Yeah Noodle the prices will go down.
13-05-2019T20:28:01,FloofyCat,Slowly but usually after the release of a successor CPU.
13-05-2019T20:28:03,AspiringNoodle,What happens if AMD pushes 8-core processors into the $250 range?
13-05-2019T20:28:22,Bgrmystr2,It's possible we might see 6 core processor in the $100 range.
13-05-2019T20:28:26,AspiringNoodle,That is greatly going to accelerate adoption.
13-05-2019T20:28:33,FloofyCat,Then it'll get taken up more Noodle but you aren't going to see it dominating the market within two years.
13-05-2019T20:28:50,FloofyCat,I'm not denying that but its not going to be commonplace within two years.
13-05-2019T20:28:53,AspiringNoodle,I can use statistics to my advantage here ;)
13-05-2019T20:29:02,TheGamePlayer,will Wacom tablets ever go down? I feel there gotten more exspensive
13-05-2019T20:29:15,AspiringNoodle,"If we define ""domination"" as sales, then AMD is already there.  If we go by % of the market using their product, then maybe not xD"
13-05-2019T20:29:47,Bgrmystr2,"xD Floofy you seem to be under the assumption that ""The market"" is steam users, or gaming, and neither of which are remotely part of the market on a broad scale."
13-05-2019T20:29:57,FloofyCat,Urrrhh...
13-05-2019T20:29:59,Bgrmystr2,the big picture is much bigger than that.
13-05-2019T20:30:02,FloofyCat,Bgr
13-05-2019T20:30:09,FloofyCat,We aren't talking about office computers or animators
13-05-2019T20:30:17,FloofyCat,We're talking about gamers
13-05-2019T20:30:23,TheGamePlayer,GAMERS
13-05-2019T20:30:25,Bgrmystr2,"Maybe you aren't, but that's the problem XD"
13-05-2019T20:30:45,FloofyCat,Urhm...
13-05-2019T20:30:52,FloofyCat,The problem is I'm saying gamers aren't going to adopt this
13-05-2019T20:30:55,FloofyCat,Within two years.
13-05-2019T20:31:06,FloofyCat,And you're not saying anything related to that at all
13-05-2019T20:31:09,Bgrmystr2,"Funny enough, both the new playstation and xbox are going to be Ryzen-based."
13-05-2019T20:31:10,FloofyCat,You're just saying 'the market'
13-05-2019T20:31:28,FloofyCat,Urhm... those are consoles.
13-05-2019T20:31:37,Bgrmystr2,so consoles aren't gaming? Good to know.
13-05-2019T20:31:37,FloofyCat,Games for those are developed and optimised specifically to console specifications.
13-05-2019T20:31:39,AspiringNoodle,I'm trying to look at older steam hardware surveys.  I want to see what the market was like back when first generation Ryzen launched.
13-05-2019T20:31:45,FloofyCat,Bgr seriously don't play that game.
13-05-2019T20:32:03,Bgrmystr2,"Floofy, you've been playing that game this entire time, I play it once and you get all twisted up? Hahaha"
13-05-2019T20:32:16,FloofyCat,Urhm no I haven't.
13-05-2019T20:32:20,Bgrmystr2,Yes ya have
13-05-2019T20:32:36,FloofyCat,I've been saying you won't get game devs tailoring games for 8+ CPU threads/cores for a good 3-5 years
13-05-2019T20:32:38,FloofyCat,That's all
13-05-2019T20:32:50,FloofyCat,All you keep going off about sales figures for the newest top of the line AMD processors
13-05-2019T20:33:06,FloofyCat,Like that means every game will suddenly buy a AMD processor in a few years.
13-05-2019T20:33:09,Bgrmystr2,And I'm saying they've been pushing those lines since it began in the early 2010s
13-05-2019T20:33:10,TheGamePlayer,"Bgr remember when Id always say my internet shit cause I, moved? welp Norvado a local Telecommunications company will most likely expand with fiber internet!  I can finally watch the streams LMAO"
13-05-2019T20:33:16,FloofyCat,Considering that means an entire new motherboard.
13-05-2019T20:33:22,Bgrmystr2,"Nice, Game."
13-05-2019T20:33:49,FloofyCat,I've said one thing and this entire time you've just been talking about something else
13-05-2019T20:33:52,TheGamePlayer,"haha ya, that also means streaming for me, Im only getting %mb down and .4mb up"
13-05-2019T20:33:57,TheGamePlayer,*5
13-05-2019T20:34:08,FloofyCat,Rip I remember life before fibre optic internet.
13-05-2019T20:34:18,FloofyCat,Jesus that was horrible.
13-05-2019T20:34:49,FloofyCat,If you wanted to watch a YT video then no one else in the house could play a game.
13-05-2019T20:35:15,TheGamePlayer,The provider now says were getting 10 down and 1 up but iv done multiple different sites including theres and it all comes to 5 and 0.4
13-05-2019T20:35:24,AspiringNoodle,"My family used to pay for 50 Mb/s internet.  Turns out our router was shite, could only deliver 20 Mb/s"
13-05-2019T20:35:29,Bgrmystr2,"I could have, but yknow, games don't have to require internet connection."
13-05-2019T20:35:35,FloofyCat,Yeah similar here Noodle.
13-05-2019T20:35:36,AspiringNoodle,"When we upgraded to 75 Mb/s, we got a router that could do that and it was amazing"
13-05-2019T20:35:48,AspiringNoodle,RIP
13-05-2019T20:36:04,FloofyCat,Although in the UK we've always had advertised 100mb/s and stuff and it only turns out to be 20mb/s because no one gets what they pay for.
13-05-2019T20:36:15,TheGamePlayer,sorry for asking but how much are you paying for that 75MB?
13-05-2019T20:36:16,FloofyCat,"And if no ISP actually gives you what you pay for, what the heck are you going to do?"
13-05-2019T20:36:22,AspiringNoodle,$50 a month
13-05-2019T20:36:24,FloofyCat,Switch to another ISP? Lul.
13-05-2019T20:36:26,TheGamePlayer,WHAT
13-05-2019T20:36:37,TheGamePlayer,.......$125
13-05-2019T20:36:44,AspiringNoodle,What country are you in?
13-05-2019T20:36:47,TheGamePlayer,US
13-05-2019T20:37:02,AspiringNoodle,Is there any particular rules about swearing?
13-05-2019T20:37:05,AspiringNoodle,I feel like swearing...
13-05-2019T20:37:09,Bgrmystr2,no rules on that no
13-05-2019T20:37:26,AspiringNoodle,Avert your eyes.  For I am about to make like a sailor
13-05-2019T20:37:35,Bgrmystr2,"Oh no, he's gonna say the fuck word."
13-05-2019T20:37:41,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
13-05-2019T20:37:49,Bgrmystr2,"nothing will change, I promise."
13-05-2019T20:37:52,TheGamePlayer,their one of the only fiber providers here and they think they can get away with charging so much for SO F****** LITTLE
13-05-2019T20:38:03,AspiringNoodle,"I can't swear now, you made me laugh xD"
13-05-2019T20:38:08,Bgrmystr2,You're welcome.
13-05-2019T20:38:21,AspiringNoodle,"Anyways, I fucking hate ISPs..."
13-05-2019T20:38:25,AspiringNoodle,I'm on to their little games.
13-05-2019T20:38:33,TheGamePlayer,See ya centrylink Norvado's in town
13-05-2019T20:38:42,Bgrmystr2,Yah they dumb. We're paying like $90 or so for 100mbit down and 10mbit up.
13-05-2019T20:38:47,Bgrmystr2,it's not fiber.
13-05-2019T20:38:53,TheGamePlayer,...
13-05-2019T20:38:57,TheGamePlayer,C or N?
13-05-2019T20:39:08,AspiringNoodle,"Honestly, the government should be suing the hell out of ISPs."
13-05-2019T20:39:18,Bgrmystr2,"It's cable, dunno what you mean by C or N"
13-05-2019T20:39:53,AspiringNoodle,ISPs are essentially given money by the government to lay down cable and upgrade infrastructure.
13-05-2019T20:39:56,TheGamePlayer,centurylink or norvado? or something else?
13-05-2019T20:40:07,Bgrmystr2,We have neither of those here.
13-05-2019T20:40:11,TheGamePlayer,ah
13-05-2019T20:40:18,AspiringNoodle,"And then they sit on their asses, complain about how difficult / expensive it is to set up / upgrade said infrastructure."
13-05-2019T20:40:22,Bgrmystr2,Cox Cable and AT&T have a duopoly here.
13-05-2019T20:40:33,Bgrmystr2,and they both overchange for trash service.
13-05-2019T20:40:41,AspiringNoodle,"Then they get in bed with politicians to write laws saying they don't have to let competitors use their infrastructure, and that cities / towns can't build their own infrastructure."
13-05-2019T20:40:44,TheGamePlayer,id rather pay $100/month for 100 down and 30 up then 5 down and .4 up
13-05-2019T20:41:14,TheGamePlayer,hell id be paying LESS
13-05-2019T20:41:14,AspiringNoodle,"They've literally rigged the market and government so they can do as little work as possible, charge as much as they want, and there's nothing you can do about it."
13-05-2019T20:41:30,AspiringNoodle,You can't switch to a competitor.  You can't build your own infrastructure.
13-05-2019T20:41:42,AspiringNoodle,You HAVE to use their shit service.  Complain to their shit customer support.
13-05-2019T20:42:02,Bgrmystr2,"you can, technically, build your own, but they'll shut you down in every bully way possible so you can't make money."
13-05-2019T20:42:14,TheGamePlayer,and this company is charging more do to expansions and not just greed and over time when it is down expanding theyll lower the prices
13-05-2019T20:42:17,AspiringNoodle,The swamp really does need drained.
13-05-2019T20:42:36,AspiringNoodle,"In this case, we need to get the corporate douchebags out of office and people in there who actually care."
13-05-2019T20:42:44,AspiringNoodle,"Give ISPs the middle finger, and force them to compete."
13-05-2019T20:42:54,AspiringNoodle,Here's an example of bullshit law.
13-05-2019T20:43:21,TheGamePlayer,"ya, give them the internet iv got see whos laughing then!"
13-05-2019T20:43:35,Bgrmystr2,"Besides, ISPs here wouldn't be doin that if we had Net Neutality, but hella lot of opponents.. AT&T, Verizon, the FCC's chairman, the president.."
13-05-2019T20:43:38,AspiringNoodle,"If there's another ISP within a half mile of your provider's infrastructure, that's considered ""competitive"""
13-05-2019T20:43:44,TheGamePlayer,it literally takes 5 days to down load a 20GB game
13-05-2019T20:44:13,AspiringNoodle,What the US needs to do is sign a law saying that ISP's have to allow competitors to use their infrastructure.
13-05-2019T20:44:19,Bgrmystr2,"yeah irrelevant if you can use their service or not, noodle."
13-05-2019T20:44:25,AspiringNoodle,^
13-05-2019T20:44:27,Bgrmystr2,"if they happen to BE there, then it's ""competitive"""
13-05-2019T20:44:37,AspiringNoodle,But can you use it?  Not relevant.
13-05-2019T20:44:48,Bgrmystr2,"nothing to do with being able to actually compete.. cuz that's not actually relevant to the very definition of the word, nop"
13-05-2019T20:44:51,Bgrmystr2,not at all
13-05-2019T20:45:23,TheGamePlayer,Norvado would win in my area they know that theres gamers and streamers up here unlike Centurylink
13-05-2019T20:45:27,AspiringNoodle,"Once net neutrality is fully reinstated, I'm hoping that this will spur people to start pushing back against those fucks at Comcast, Verizon, and whoever else bends their consumers over to be as lazy as possible."
13-05-2019T20:45:39,TheGamePlayer,and they dont charge an arm and a leg
13-05-2019T20:45:47,Bgrmystr2,"same, noodle"
13-05-2019T20:45:49,Bgrmystr2,needs to happen
13-05-2019T20:46:03,TheGamePlayer,ya
13-05-2019T20:46:09,AspiringNoodle,The biggest thing we could do is force them to allow competitors to use their infrastructure.
13-05-2019T20:46:26,AspiringNoodle,"No more multiple networks overlapping, just one system that can be bolstered."
13-05-2019T20:46:42,AspiringNoodle,And whoever did the work gets royalties.
13-05-2019T20:48:24,TheGamePlayer,"looks like the Norvado site is going through maintenance work, every thing is weird looking and none of the links to their ""bundle builder"" are working"
13-05-2019T20:48:58,AspiringNoodle,anyone else remembers those old comcast commercials?
13-05-2019T20:49:03,AspiringNoodle,The one making fun of fios?
13-05-2019T20:49:12,AspiringNoodle,And it turns out Fios is the better tech...
13-05-2019T20:49:13,TheGamePlayer,$199.99 for 300MB Dl 50MB Ul
13-05-2019T20:49:42,TheGamePlayer,that sounds good to me
13-05-2019T20:49:51,AspiringNoodle,The upload speed is a bit crappy.  But the price / download speed is essentially the same value I'm paying.
13-05-2019T20:50:28,TheGamePlayer,hey ill go for 50 Ul thats good enough for me.
13-05-2019T20:50:40,AspiringNoodle,"Tbf, upload doesn't apply to many people ;D"
13-05-2019T20:50:57,AspiringNoodle,How many people are going to be uploading videos or files that are gigabytes in size?
13-05-2019T20:51:01,TheGamePlayer,then a gig is a bit over priced but thats just because of expansion payments
13-05-2019T20:51:38,TheGamePlayer,"streaming, uploading you tube vids, hosting servers that type of stuff"
13-05-2019T20:52:34,AspiringNoodle,"Btw, I do know your pain.  Even though before I was getting 20Mbps internet (even though I was paying for 50)"
13-05-2019T20:53:04,AspiringNoodle,I have a huge backlog of games to go through.  And my 360's internal wifi was borked.  Downloaded at 1 - 2 Mbps.
13-05-2019T20:53:07,AspiringNoodle,The pain ;_;
13-05-2019T20:53:13,TheGamePlayer,ya thats awful
13-05-2019T20:53:23,AspiringNoodle,I went to my local gamestop and got an adapter ^^
13-05-2019T20:53:33,TheGamePlayer,I download a 300-800Kb/s
13-05-2019T20:53:40,TheGamePlayer,*At
13-05-2019T20:53:47,AspiringNoodle,Now it downloads at 20 - 25.  AND it doesn't slow down everyone else.  It will be life-changing
13-05-2019T20:54:10,AspiringNoodle,My apologies that you are the victim of bullshit ISP legislation and sloth.
13-05-2019T20:55:00,TheGamePlayer,"yes, OOO they updated their site, so they now ""serve"" the towns below me, AND theyll be expanding Through my area."
13-05-2019T20:56:11,AspiringNoodle,*Mr. Burns fingers* Excellent
13-05-2019T20:56:18,TheGamePlayer,lol
13-05-2019T20:56:43,AspiringNoodle,...I'm gonna miss gamestop when it's gone
13-05-2019T20:57:00,TheGamePlayer,Dr. Evil: *finger to mouth* one biiillion dollars!
13-05-2019T20:57:05,AspiringNoodle,"Where else could I go to a store in 2019, and buy a random accessory for a last-gen console?"
13-05-2019T20:57:11,TheGamePlayer,*terabytes
13-05-2019T20:57:25,TheGamePlayer,idk
13-05-2019T20:57:32,TheGamePlayer,newegg?
13-05-2019T20:58:05,Bgrmystr2,"I'm not gonna miss gamestop myself, but I'm not a fan of their anti-consumer practices anyway."
13-05-2019T20:58:14,AspiringNoodle,I was able to examine the product before I purchased it ;)
13-05-2019T20:58:19,Bgrmystr2,someone else better will rise in their place.
13-05-2019T20:58:33,AspiringNoodle,These past few decades have been a hoot.
13-05-2019T20:58:39,TheGamePlayer,I loved block buster
13-05-2019T20:58:52,AspiringNoodle,"new business models rise up to fill a need of the market, only to be outpaced by tech and die just as quickly as they were born."
13-05-2019T20:59:07,AspiringNoodle,"Even Redbox is in trouble, lmao"
13-05-2019T20:59:22,Bgrmystr2,"yeh block buster wasn't too bad, it's just not suited to survive nowadays"
13-05-2019T20:59:22,TheGamePlayer,everything is in trouble
13-05-2019T21:01:51,AspiringNoodle,So tired...
13-05-2019T21:02:11,TheGamePlayer,"same, taking my driving test stressed the fuck out of me"
13-05-2019T21:02:25,AspiringNoodle,Life decisions for me ;)
13-05-2019T21:02:43,TheGamePlayer,im just staying up
13-05-2019T21:02:56,TheGamePlayer,still celebrating
13-05-2019T21:03:03,AspiringNoodle,Long story short... no longer interested in game dev.  Found out some big studios were near me.  Started tailoring a resume for entry-level positions.  Then more horror stories came out.
13-05-2019T21:03:26,TheGamePlayer,ooof
13-05-2019T21:03:51,AspiringNoodle,I was well aware of the kind of stuff that goes on in game development for years.  considered a different path as I was finishing up my degree.
13-05-2019T21:04:07,TheGamePlayer,art?
13-05-2019T21:04:11,TheGamePlayer,idk XD
13-05-2019T21:04:17,AspiringNoodle,Art :)
13-05-2019T21:04:41,AspiringNoodle,"Something that disappeared from my life as WoW came in, I wonder if the two are connected (you know they are stop lying to yourself)"
13-05-2019T21:05:09,TheGamePlayer,lol what?
13-05-2019T21:05:34,AspiringNoodle,"Um, I liked art a lot when I was younger.  Then WoW happened xD"
13-05-2019T21:05:45,TheGamePlayer,lol
13-05-2019T21:06:12,AspiringNoodle,"12 years later, I quit.  And now I'm trying to put myself back together."
13-05-2019T21:06:19,TheGamePlayer,im currently painting my dog who passed a few months back and I love how its turning out
13-05-2019T21:06:49,AspiringNoodle,"I did get a minor in art while I was in college, so I know I'm not hopeless."
13-05-2019T21:07:29,AspiringNoodle,"Now it's just a case of ""What do you want to do specifically?"""
13-05-2019T21:07:49,TheGamePlayer,im getting into that
13-05-2019T21:08:04,Bgrmystr2,"I never played wow, but that's cuz I don't appreciate being told I can't play a game I legally purchased cuz I have to pay them MORE to have the privilage of touching that thing I already bought."
13-05-2019T21:08:11,Bgrmystr2,getouttahere with that garbage
13-05-2019T21:08:21,TheGamePlayer,idk what Id like to do butmusic and art are definitely are things I love
13-05-2019T21:08:59,TheGamePlayer,holy cow im tired look at that
13-05-2019T21:09:17,AspiringNoodle,I'm definitely in the realm of wanting to tell stories.
13-05-2019T21:09:27,TheGamePlayer,cool!
13-05-2019T21:09:34,TheGamePlayer,tell me a story lol
13-05-2019T21:10:05,AspiringNoodle,"Ironically, programming a game doesn't do much for actually telling a story."
13-05-2019T21:10:18,AspiringNoodle,Maybe I just wanted to be a part of the effort? xD
13-05-2019T21:10:29,AspiringNoodle,But it's definitely the story that's told that does it for me.
13-05-2019T21:10:30,TheGamePlayer,lol
13-05-2019T21:11:12,AspiringNoodle,There once was an anxious man.
13-05-2019T21:11:22,AspiringNoodle,This man was so anxious about what he wanted to do in life.
13-05-2019T21:11:30,AspiringNoodle,He got soooooo anxious that he died.
13-05-2019T21:11:31,AspiringNoodle,The end.
13-05-2019T21:11:34,TheGamePlayer,XD
13-05-2019T21:11:43,TheGamePlayer,thats awful
13-05-2019T21:12:01,TheGamePlayer,dont be that anxious
13-05-2019T21:12:19,AspiringNoodle,I need to get me some digital art software.
13-05-2019T21:12:34,TheGamePlayer,same + a tablet
13-05-2019T21:12:49,AspiringNoodle,I asked for a tablet for a birthday a few years back.
13-05-2019T21:13:01,AspiringNoodle,Some books on animation too :D
13-05-2019T21:13:15,TheGamePlayer,nice
13-05-2019T21:13:24,AspiringNoodle,"Suffice to say, the art minor definitely had me enjoying the 2d aspect"
13-05-2019T21:13:49,TheGamePlayer,haha
13-05-2019T21:15:31,AspiringNoodle,"Also, let's be honest.  We all want them sweet cintiqs with the display :)"
13-05-2019T21:15:47,AspiringNoodle,But have neither the money nor the skill to justify buying them!
13-05-2019T21:15:59,TheGamePlayer,yes
13-05-2019T21:16:07,TheGamePlayer,well id kinda have the skill
13-05-2019T21:16:11,TheGamePlayer,but not the money
13-05-2019T21:16:42,AspiringNoodle,"Even if I had the money, I probably wouldn't buy one of the big cintiqs until my art was approaching a point of ""can I live on this?"""
13-05-2019T21:17:06,TheGamePlayer,"id love to get someones attention with one of my paintings. someone at my school was offered $5000 for an eagle painting a few years back, they kindly refused though"
13-05-2019T21:17:08,AspiringNoodle,"And thats' where the smaller 13 - 16"" ones come in."
13-05-2019T21:17:23,TheGamePlayer,ye
13-05-2019T21:18:12,AspiringNoodle,"That reminds me.  I need to reconsider how much money I'm going to spend on my next computer and where, haha."
13-05-2019T21:18:24,AspiringNoodle,Maybe allocate more money towards storage.
13-05-2019T21:18:45,TheGamePlayer,haha Im about finished building mine its at $5200 atm
13-05-2019T21:18:55,AspiringNoodle,Jesus O_O
13-05-2019T21:19:09,TheGamePlayer,its a school project as well so I get credits for it
13-05-2019T21:19:59,AspiringNoodle,"I've been saving for money for 2 years to build a system that will last me 5 years at least, and hopefully for more than 10 before a new build is needed."
13-05-2019T21:20:07,TheGamePlayer,its a huge pc too not just size but power.
13-05-2019T21:20:07,AspiringNoodle,And I was hoping to do it for $3000 and under.
13-05-2019T21:20:44,TheGamePlayer,"ohh ya, I went for looks, you could totally do one good or even better then mine for $3000 or under"
13-05-2019T21:21:11,AspiringNoodle,"I did check newegg, and at worst it'll be $3500, depending on what parts I opt for."
13-05-2019T21:21:29,TheGamePlayer,iv got the Corsair Obsidian 1000D case so that adds 13 fans $100 for packs of 3 soo that really killed me
13-05-2019T21:21:34,AspiringNoodle,"And tbh, if I plan to practice my digital art seriously, I'm going to need a lot more storage..."
13-05-2019T21:22:37,TheGamePlayer,I need more as well
13-05-2019T21:22:46,TheGamePlayer,game vids arnt making that easy
13-05-2019T21:24:53,AspiringNoodle,"At worst, my case is going to have 7 fans.  And the big question is RGB or no RGB ;)"
13-05-2019T21:30:03,TheGamePlayer,ah
13-05-2019T21:30:28,AspiringNoodle,Good lord that case is a beast.
13-05-2019T21:30:35,TheGamePlayer,ye XD
13-05-2019T21:30:55,TheGamePlayer,got an RTX 2080 and a GTX 1060 in it
13-05-2019T21:33:38,AspiringNoodle,"I did consider more than one card, but it's a bad investment for gaming.  And doesn't do much for 3d animation unless you do everything."
13-05-2019T21:34:03,AspiringNoodle,"I would buy a cheaper card, but I went a bit nuts upgrading my monitor ^^;"
13-05-2019T21:34:23,TheGamePlayer,lol
13-05-2019T21:34:33,AspiringNoodle,I used a 1280x1024 monitor for 10 years.
13-05-2019T21:34:38,AspiringNoodle,I went 1440p
13-05-2019T21:35:33,AspiringNoodle,"I wish I could buy cheaper, but the 2080 is the cheapest card that can reliably hit 60FPS in even the most demanding games."
13-05-2019T21:35:48,TheGamePlayer,hell ye
13-05-2019T21:36:17,AspiringNoodle,"I *might* be able to get away with a 2070, depending on how far it can overclock.  But the 2080 will definitely have more longevity."
13-05-2019T21:36:34,TheGamePlayer,ya
13-05-2019T21:37:17,AspiringNoodle,"That said, will I even game?  I want to get through my console backlog before I get into my pc games.  And I don't know if I'll ever get through that."
13-05-2019T21:37:51,AspiringNoodle,It's been like a month since I've played a console game ._.
13-05-2019T21:40:13,TheGamePlayer,I havent play console for a bit too
13-05-2019T21:41:25,AspiringNoodle,There's one thing I don't get
13-05-2019T21:41:46,AspiringNoodle,"The industry seems obsessed with replacing 1080p with 4k, when 1440p is a far more reasonable step."
13-05-2019T21:42:49,AspiringNoodle,"And when it comes to games, even with how powerful cards are today, it's damn near impossible to reliably hit 60 fps with a single card at max settings"
13-05-2019T21:46:04,TheGamePlayer,ya
13-05-2019T21:47:07,TheGamePlayer,"My 2080 kills it though I used to have a GT 730 and holy cow was it powerful, It ran fallout 4 at 60fps but it had to be at the smallest window and lowest settings but still It ran games well"
13-05-2019T21:52:39,AspiringNoodle,"I think the big thing is that I realized after building my first computer that it's much easier to just spend a lot of money up front, upgrade a part or two down the line, then build a whole new system, as opposed to slowly upgrade over time."
13-05-2019T22:00:26,AspiringNoodle,"Wow, would you look at the time?"
13-05-2019T22:00:34,AspiringNoodle,Really got sucked into those conversations
13-05-2019T22:51:59,TheGamePlayer,gtg night Noodle
13-05-2019T23:34:12,SpazztasticKiwi,🥔
13-05-2019T23:34:35,TheGamePlayer,potato?
13-05-2019T23:40:49,AspiringNoodle,"That seems like a metaphor for how my computer feels, haha"
13-05-2019T23:42:37,AspiringNoodle,"Not that the 3570k is super outdated or anything.  I just remember playing Rainbow Six Siege within the first year of its release, and my processor being at 80% util."
13-05-2019T23:43:09,AspiringNoodle,"Maybe that was just the 100% cpu usage bug, though.  I did lower my settings later..."
13-05-2019T23:44:41,AspiringNoodle,...I want :fries: now.  Thanks for that Kiwi xD
13-05-2019T23:49:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Sometimes the carbs summon Tom
13-05-2019T23:50:02,SpazztasticKiwi,But it’s more a bit that I’m still lurkin
13-05-2019T23:56:02,AspiringNoodle,"Now that I think about it, I shouldn't get any fries.  I need to lose weight"
13-05-2019T23:56:10,AspiringNoodle,"The temptation is strong, though."
