11-02-2019T00:02:16,Mippy,"I had food, is now laying in bed watching Bob, Wade, Mark, and Ethan play Bloody Trapland 2"
11-02-2019T00:06:01,Twokinds,Today has been good.
11-02-2019T00:09:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Ethan joined?!
11-02-2019T00:09:51,SpazztasticKiwi,I haven‚Äôt seen that video yet. But t I guess that means I got a to do to do
11-02-2019T00:10:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Also that‚Äôs good Tom. Prrrrrroductivity‚Ñ¢Ô∏è keeps the blood flowin
11-02-2019T00:11:30,Mippy,"Yup, for every good day there is a....good day"
11-02-2019T00:12:03,Mippy,Ethan is in the videos on Bob‚Äôs channel
11-02-2019T00:14:32,SpazztasticKiwi,I like how marks members videos went from #11 to #13
11-02-2019T00:14:56,SpazztasticKiwi,No #12. And I can pretty safely say he doesn‚Äôt realize it
11-02-2019T00:15:31,Mippy,I haven‚Äôt seen the members videos since I‚Äôm not a member but that is pretty funny
11-02-2019T00:16:55,SpazztasticKiwi,This man lives alone in la. Gives me a ray of hope that I‚Äôll be ok when I move out if he‚Äôs managed to stay alive
11-02-2019T00:17:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Him and Ethan and Se√°n
11-02-2019T00:19:39,Mippy,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
11-02-2019T00:22:31,SpazztasticKiwi,I still replay that zoom Amy did when he was adding salt instead of sugar in that cooking video
11-02-2019T00:22:42,SpazztasticKiwi,in my head. It‚Äôs the little things
11-02-2019T00:26:28,Mippy,Was that the resent one? ....yeah it was. Mark is a man that owns five ovens
11-02-2019T00:28:26,SpazztasticKiwi,And he seemed so astounded by the fact. I really hope his fire alarms work
11-02-2019T00:29:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Granted most of those ovens were specialty ovens for other things and then he had a normal oven and microwave oven
11-02-2019T00:29:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Which isn‚Äôt technically an oven
11-02-2019T00:29:31,SpazztasticKiwi,But ok Mark
11-02-2019T00:31:05,SpazztasticKiwi,And you remember in that same video Ethan almost set Mark on fire with the hairspray and lighter
11-02-2019T00:31:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Grown adults. They need supervision and all things sharp and fire related taken away
11-02-2019T00:32:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Though if you‚Äôll remember Mark also kicked Ethan in the face while on tour so maybe that was a hair or revenge
11-02-2019T00:34:02,Mippy,"Oh, yeah, that happened. Poor Ethan."
11-02-2019T00:35:05,SpazztasticKiwi,The entire next week of Marks Twitter was just ‚ÄúIt WaS aN aCcIdEnT‚Äù
11-02-2019T00:36:25,Mippy,Hehehe Can you crack an egg without cracking it?
11-02-2019T00:36:54,SpazztasticKiwi,They English just about as well as I do
11-02-2019T00:37:12,Mippy,Ethan is a presious blue boi
11-02-2019T00:37:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Precious blueberry boi
11-02-2019T00:38:07,Mippy,And Tyler forgets they have separate ovens
11-02-2019T00:38:07,SpazztasticKiwi,He‚Äôs literally only a few days younger than me and it‚Äôs like he‚Äôs years younger
11-02-2019T00:38:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Tyler ‚ÄúI better not put that hot pan on your glass shelves and crack the glass‚Äù
11-02-2019T00:38:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Mark ‚ÄúYeah don‚Äôt break my shelves‚Äù
11-02-2019T00:39:46,SpazztasticKiwi,One of my favorite moments about mark was when he was recording with his mom at home
11-02-2019T00:40:13,SpazztasticKiwi,He made a mistake and goes ‚ÄúGod..d-..God bless America‚Äù
11-02-2019T00:40:46,Mippy,I love the Momiplier videos. She‚Äôs such a hoot.
11-02-2019T00:40:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Just the best comedic timing and fade out save I cant
11-02-2019T00:41:19,SpazztasticKiwi,The cooking livestream was nice
11-02-2019T00:41:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I believe they came up with something like 70 something steps
11-02-2019T00:41:56,SpazztasticKiwi,And wash hands was what number 7 or something
11-02-2019T00:42:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Chaos
11-02-2019T00:42:17,Mippy,Made me want bulgogi...but that recipe was quite complicated
11-02-2019T00:43:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Watching food videos is a bad habit. I should know. Mike Chen does alot of Korean and Japanese food touring
11-02-2019T00:43:58,RimaDraws,back a bit
11-02-2019T00:44:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I can‚Äôt pronounce half of what he shows but it sure makes me want to hit up a Korean restaurant
11-02-2019T00:44:31,Mippy,Yeah...it‚Äôs like my Food Network addiction
11-02-2019T00:44:43,SpazztasticKiwi,If only we had one within like
11-02-2019T00:44:48,SpazztasticKiwi,1000 miles
11-02-2019T00:45:30,Mippy,"Yeah...we have Tai, Japanese, and Chinese...no Korean"
11-02-2019T00:46:01,Mippy,Closest thing I can get is at Wok Box :ctwokinds-sadtrace2:
11-02-2019T00:46:08,SpazztasticKiwi,"With as off kilter Mark and them get though, they‚Äôre definitely put together people"
11-02-2019T00:46:22,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs just sometimes....I worry
11-02-2019T00:47:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Ay Rima we‚Äôre talking Markiplier and gang
11-02-2019T00:47:17,RimaDraws,ah ok?
11-02-2019T00:47:24,RimaDraws,i dont watch much of his stuff
11-02-2019T00:47:33,Mippy,:ptv-shock:
11-02-2019T00:47:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Honestly I don‚Äôt much either. I veer more to Se√°n
11-02-2019T00:47:59,RimaDraws,i used to watch him alot. but i just like some of his videos here and there
11-02-2019T00:48:13,SpazztasticKiwi,But for some reason the watchtime on Marks channel is higher. Probably because he‚Äôs often got longer videos
11-02-2019T00:48:41,RimaDraws,maybe idk
11-02-2019T00:49:05,Mippy,I haven‚Äôt watched Sean in a while...I‚Äôve been neglecting him.
11-02-2019T00:49:13,SpazztasticKiwi,I believe this is the first year Se√°n didn‚Äôt do a happy birthday video
11-02-2019T00:49:21,SpazztasticKiwi,He streamed but that was it
11-02-2019T00:49:27,RimaDraws,i havent watched him either for the longest time due to work school or other things
11-02-2019T00:49:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Green bean is 29 now
11-02-2019T00:50:04,RimaDraws,i am gonna be 32 this year
11-02-2019T00:50:07,SpazztasticKiwi,And he‚Äôs finally learned to take a breath between sentences
11-02-2019T00:50:20,Mippy,29...I‚Äôll be there soon enough. :ctwokinds-rainehappy:
11-02-2019T00:50:29,RimaDraws,little ones lol
11-02-2019T00:50:32,RimaDraws,jk
11-02-2019T00:50:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Mark‚Äôs been mentioned his big 3.0 birthday
11-02-2019T00:50:52,RimaDraws,trust me turning 30 is nothing special. its just another year. i am two months younger than tom
11-02-2019T00:51:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah I dunno what he‚Äôs gonna do but he‚Äôs mentioned he‚Äôs ready for it
11-02-2019T00:51:36,Mippy,"Honestly, it been ‚Äújust another year‚Äù since I turned 16."
11-02-2019T00:52:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Se√°ns been the one hyper about it. Can‚Äôt believe he‚Äôs 29 already
11-02-2019T00:52:34,RimaDraws,i think this week i am gonna just treat myself to dinner i make for myself at home.
11-02-2019T00:52:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Like. I can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre 29 dude
11-02-2019T00:52:47,RimaDraws,for vday since i cant officially spend it with my partner
11-02-2019T00:52:53,SpazztasticKiwi,I remember when you were still early 20s
11-02-2019T00:53:39,RimaDraws,god i am so glad my 20s are gone
11-02-2019T00:53:40,Mippy,I‚Äôm gonna spend vday the same way I spend every vday.
11-02-2019T00:54:02,SpazztasticKiwi,At work
11-02-2019T00:54:06,Mippy,Doing whatever it is I do on a nightly basis
11-02-2019T00:54:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Aide that‚Äôs gonna be mine
11-02-2019T00:54:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Cause
11-02-2019T00:54:15,RimaDraws,yea ill be at work earlier that day and then just at home talking to crimson
11-02-2019T00:55:15,Mippy,"Yup, I‚Äôll be at work. Not that I really care. Vday is just an excuse for companies to sell chocolate at inflated prices"
11-02-2019T00:55:21,RimaDraws,probably doing homework or art commissions
11-02-2019T00:55:30,RimaDraws,i agree
11-02-2019T00:55:41,RimaDraws,why even have a partner if you dont love them everyday
11-02-2019T00:56:19,Mippy,Exactly! I love my fictional man all the time
11-02-2019T00:56:40,RimaDraws,well crimson isnt fictional. i talk to him everyday
11-02-2019T00:57:51,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúLove is in the air‚Äù Me: *grabs lysol*
11-02-2019T00:57:54,Mippy,:ptv-hearts: Rima and Crimson sitting in a tree üå≤
11-02-2019T00:58:39,RimaDraws,not quill. crimsonhelsing. he watches toms streams
11-02-2019T00:59:11,Mippy,I kind of figured...either that or you were talking about a cat
11-02-2019T01:00:07,RimaDraws,oh no my cats are named qrow and winter
11-02-2019T01:02:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm starting to believe I need a bib when eating
11-02-2019T01:02:24,Mippy,Feeding the boobies?
11-02-2019T01:02:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Unfortunately
11-02-2019T01:02:45,Mippy,Maybe they will grow
11-02-2019T01:02:47,RimaDraws,lol
11-02-2019T01:02:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I wish so hard
11-02-2019T01:03:17,SpazztasticKiwi,God knows they eat more than I do sometimes
11-02-2019T01:03:36,RimaDraws,i had a friend who said that if your food falls out of your mouth while eating you have a hole in your chin
11-02-2019T01:04:13,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve completely missed my mouth before
11-02-2019T01:04:15,Mippy,I dropped Indian food on mine earlier...it‚Äôs kind of hard to miss them
11-02-2019T01:04:40,SpazztasticKiwi,You‚Äôd think with such a small target mine are food would miss
11-02-2019T01:04:51,SpazztasticKiwi,But no. Female curse lives with me too
11-02-2019T01:05:50,RimaDraws,welp bedtime! night all!
11-02-2019T01:06:01,SpazztasticKiwi,üëãüèª
11-02-2019T01:06:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I need to hunt my floss
11-02-2019T01:06:40,Mippy,"Yeah, I‚Äôm gonna be going as well. Got school in the morning. Night Rima, Kiwi, Tom."
11-02-2019T01:06:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Ok bye bye you two
11-02-2019T01:07:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I might go to bed early but I also doubt it. Se√°ns got lots of RE to watch
11-02-2019T01:07:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Night Tom
11-02-2019T01:12:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Didn‚Äôt mean to flood the chat
11-02-2019T01:13:53,Dadrobit,"Welp, Apex has officially fucked my sleep scheduly."
11-02-2019T01:14:01,Dadrobit,schedule*
11-02-2019T01:14:12,Dadrobit,My spelling has always been shit
11-02-2019T01:15:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Ah. Some things never change
11-02-2019T01:17:09,SpazztasticKiwi,I hope it bought your schedule dinner first
11-02-2019T01:18:26,Dadrobit,Literally the opposite. Shirking work to play games means less dosh for food.
11-02-2019T01:28:42,Twokinds,G'night!
11-02-2019T01:29:56,Bgrmystr2,gnight tom
11-02-2019T01:34:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I almost said night night at 11 before I realized that‚Äôs not my time that he goes to bed
11-02-2019T01:35:01,SpazztasticKiwi,So I ended up piping it in 7 minutes after. But better lil late than never. To another work day ü•Ç

11-02-2019T12:13:53,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-MikeLewd:
11-02-2019T13:58:08,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs 58 and I‚Äôm sweating. How
11-02-2019T14:11:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Also I heard a thump in the night and sent a 10 pound cat to investigate
11-02-2019T14:29:48,Twokinds,"58, huh? Well, temperature tolerances can change at that age. Could explain the sweating."
11-02-2019T14:30:44,Dadrobit,Hahahahahahahahahahaha
11-02-2019T14:33:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Ok smartass
11-02-2019T14:34:03,SpazztasticKiwi,"And I‚Äôll pony out I said ‚Äúit‚Äôs‚Äù 58, not ‚ÄúI‚Äôm‚Äù 58 so üëÖ"

11-02-2019T14:35:38,Dadrobit,"Huh, looked at iliar's gallery layout. Haven't seen that sketch for Jared, was that ever made public anywhere?"
11-02-2019T14:35:48,SpazztasticKiwi,You know eyesight loss is an indication of age too
11-02-2019T14:36:00,Twokinds,I posted that on my twitter!
11-02-2019T14:36:07,Dadrobit,Ohhhhh

11-02-2019T14:40:41,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm not a battle royal person
11-02-2019T14:41:08,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôll watch but I‚Äôm likely not any good
11-02-2019T14:41:14,iliar,Dadrobit: All arts in the gallery have links to original posts.
11-02-2019T14:41:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Iliar fancy with the professionalism
11-02-2019T14:41:43,Dadrobit,I'm absolute crap on PC. Best game I've had was only three kills...
11-02-2019T14:42:27,Dadrobit,"Ahhh, you mentioned one of them redirected to Patreaon. I assumed then that the gallery was specifically just for Patreon posts."
11-02-2019T14:42:59,Dadrobit,Patreon*
11-02-2019T14:45:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Here is a very odd and completely off the wall question but have any of you had cream cheese doughnuts
11-02-2019T14:47:10,Dadrobit,"I'm sure this would add no small amount of work to the gallery, (great work already btw) but are there any plans to add a text search feature? One that could include sketch titles? Or suggester/Nora Card patron?"
11-02-2019T14:47:39,Dadrobit,Though the name part would likely be even harder as sometimes names get jumbled even in the description text.
11-02-2019T14:48:28,Dadrobit,And yes I have Spazz. They are the penultimate form of the sin of temptation.
11-02-2019T14:49:58,Dadrobit,Up there with cream cheese stuffed French Toast slathered in berries and syrup.
11-02-2019T14:50:12,iliar,This is not a priority task.
11-02-2019T14:52:44,Dadrobit,"For sure, the tag indexing is already pretty satisfactory for inquiries."
11-02-2019T14:54:36,Dadrobit,"One suggestion perhaps? A ""Clear selected tags"" button at the top of the list so that after a search the user doesn't have to manually scroll and reset the page unchecking every tag they've made?"
11-02-2019T15:01:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Also how often do you guys change a pets water bowl
11-02-2019T15:02:12,Dadrobit,Twice a day.
11-02-2019T15:02:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve found some are astonished to know I clean Bagheera‚Äôs out every day before I go to work
11-02-2019T15:02:54,SpazztasticKiwi,He won‚Äôt really drink out of it otherwise
11-02-2019T15:02:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Spolied
11-02-2019T15:03:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Has to see me rinse and refill it. Don‚Äôt notice him use it if he doesn‚Äôt
11-02-2019T15:05:37,Dadrobit,"It's hot and dry out here, water just disappears. Fresh water in the morning, and then again in the mid-afternoon."
11-02-2019T15:06:18,Dadrobit,"Plus animals tend to get their water dirty pretty quick with their own hair, so it's just a good thing to do."
11-02-2019T15:06:57,Dadrobit,"My ideology was basically, if I wouldn't drink it, I'm not going to force my pet to drink it."
11-02-2019T15:07:56,SpazztasticKiwi,That‚Äôs how I see for the outdoor dogs. But the cats inside I just watch the water for stuff
11-02-2019T15:08:23,SpazztasticKiwi,And I usually just tend to my cats water
11-02-2019T15:08:56,Dadrobit,"I do not have a high regard for people who force their dogs to be ""outside"" pets in Arizona. Especially when they're a breed like a Husky."
11-02-2019T15:09:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Ours are pit and lab pit and a small Pomeranian mix
11-02-2019T15:09:46,SpazztasticKiwi,The pit and mix have mega energy
11-02-2019T15:10:13,Dadrobit,"It boggles the mind that folks can just be okay with their pet outside in 115+ weather just because, ""Oh, they have water, they'll be fine."""
11-02-2019T15:10:26,SpazztasticKiwi,So outside they run and sun themselves. The lab pit just likes to be out to explore anymore
11-02-2019T15:11:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah we had a person with a husky. They kept him outside. Now we font get hell level hot but we get hot
11-02-2019T15:11:29,SpazztasticKiwi,he was old. He‚Äôs got to have passed cause he‚Äôs not been out in months
11-02-2019T15:11:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Had a suped up doghouse tho
11-02-2019T15:12:37,Dadrobit,Used to have a black lab and a Idontevenknow mutt. They hated going outside even to use to go do their business. They used to bolt back inside when they were done so they could just lie on the cold tile and pant for a bit. Outside not even for 5 minutes..
11-02-2019T15:14:42,Dadrobit,I think he was a husky/lab mix?
11-02-2019T15:15:12,Dadrobit,He was 100% an inside dog.
11-02-2019T15:19:13,Bgrmystr2,"@Iliar Not sure if you care, but I think the first version is superior, as the 2nd version is not friendly to non-patrons. Stuff like the Vixen Keith 2 is patreon only due to prudeness."
11-02-2019T15:22:04,iliar,I know. This is the reason why I made a separate page with links. But Tom wants option 2
11-02-2019T15:23:39,Bgrmystr2,welp. That gallery won't be any useful for anyone who can't access the patreon page. Maybe you can forward it to deviantart.
11-02-2019T15:25:37,iliar,I have one idea how to solve this problem. But I'm not sure yet.
11-02-2019T15:27:42,Bgrmystr2,"If it were me, I'd probably forward all the accessable posts to patreon except the ones that are patron only (besides stuff like MM which is intentionally patreon-only for a week)"
11-02-2019T15:29:15,Twokinds,I don't want a seperate gallery.
11-02-2019T15:29:47,Twokinds,"All I want is a way to see all the posts in a nice, convenient thumbnail view."
11-02-2019T15:30:02,Twokinds,Which Patreon and twitter does not have.
11-02-2019T15:30:47,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, I get that. We don't really have a good place to easily access all the artwork though. :thinking:"
11-02-2019T15:42:22,Bgrmystr2,"either way, 37 pages.. would be nice to have at least four rows something. On my display it's all sorts of letterboxed."
11-02-2019T15:46:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Is this Patreon we‚Äôre talking about
11-02-2019T15:46:47,Bgrmystr2,"no, iliar created an alternate page that gives a gallery view of the arts tom posts"
11-02-2019T15:47:05,Bgrmystr2,and one hosts the art while the other redirects to patreon instead
11-02-2019T15:49:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Dude here at the store with a friend looking at the valentines stuff thought they were together but no the girl is there as damage control
11-02-2019T15:49:30,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúYou think she‚Äôd like this?‚Äù
11-02-2019T15:50:48,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, the only reason you'd ask that question is if they know her."
11-02-2019T15:50:54,Bgrmystr2,"otherwise, there's no point."
11-02-2019T15:52:47,SpazztasticKiwi,I like how they already got swim suits out
11-02-2019T15:59:35,Dadrobit,Do those go away where you're at?
11-02-2019T15:59:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah. For like 2 months

11-02-2019T16:19:55,Twokinds,There's a bird in my yard that's either really dumb or a daredevil.
11-02-2019T16:20:15,Twokinds,"It keeps landing in the yard, getting chased by one of the dogs, only to land back in the yard again."

11-02-2019T16:20:56,Bgrmystr2,bird don't care. it can get away from dog
11-02-2019T16:21:08,Bgrmystr2,"the website takes a bit to update the avatar, trooper"
11-02-2019T16:21:18,trooper655,ok thx
11-02-2019T16:22:09,Bgrmystr2,"it also may not have worked. If you full refresh the page with a cache clear, it would probably load on your end, but it may not have uploaded properly"
11-02-2019T16:22:09,Xexanoth,bird is bored
11-02-2019T16:22:26,Xexanoth,so it plays with dog
11-02-2019T16:22:27,trooper655,also ive been trying to ask can tom make a natani plush
11-02-2019T16:23:05,Bgrmystr2,lol tom doesn't really have the time to make stuff like that
11-02-2019T16:23:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Gotta find someone who could
11-02-2019T16:23:42,Bgrmystr2,yeah ^
11-02-2019T16:23:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Not like Tom knows how to sew
11-02-2019T16:24:06,Bgrmystr2,"and if I recall correctly, he was planning to have a nibbly made first?"
11-02-2019T16:24:16,Bgrmystr2,if he did have someone make plushies
11-02-2019T16:24:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Nibbly is priority
11-02-2019T16:24:19,trooper655,i ment like him make it avalible
11-02-2019T16:24:32,Bgrmystr2,what you're asking is the same thing.
11-02-2019T16:24:45,Bgrmystr2,you can't have something available without having someone to make the product itself.
11-02-2019T16:24:57,trooper655,ok thx
11-02-2019T16:25:41,trooper655,so if im correct he will have to have someone make it first
11-02-2019T16:26:51,Bgrmystr2,"well yeah, someone has to make the thing for it to exist for someone else to buy that thing."
11-02-2019T16:27:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôd be happy with a Nibbly keychain
11-02-2019T16:27:28,Dadrobit,"Much less sewing and mass producing various plushes, I just wanna know if he can grill a good steak?"
11-02-2019T16:27:32,trooper655,ok thx
11-02-2019T16:27:46,Twokinds,Of course I can!
11-02-2019T16:27:49,trooper655,may i ask whats a nibbly
11-02-2019T16:27:51,Dadrobit,"Inb4 ""Well done and slathered in ketchup"""
11-02-2019T16:28:02,Twokinds,If by grill you mean in a pan.

11-02-2019T16:28:35,Dadrobit,Goddammit
11-02-2019T16:28:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Not ketchup
11-02-2019T16:28:47,SpazztasticKiwi,You heathen
11-02-2019T16:28:56,Dadrobit,Cooking with butter is a viable thing.
11-02-2019T16:29:02,Dadrobit,In a pan even
11-02-2019T16:29:09,trooper655,so no natani plushy yet awn
11-02-2019T16:29:14,Mippy,(Also really wants plushies but knows it‚Äôs a pipe dream) I like my steak still bleeding a bit
11-02-2019T16:29:27,Bgrmystr2,lol.. I like how equally viable options for cooking are for some reason unacceptable.

11-02-2019T16:30:08,Dadrobit,And it is the part of the steak that makes it actually taste good without.... Condiments...
11-02-2019T16:30:12,Azumachan,keep it to sauce it
11-02-2019T16:30:20,Xexanoth,my ancestor didn't tame fire to leave meat uncooked
11-02-2019T16:30:30,Bgrmystr2,xD xex
11-02-2019T16:30:53,Dadrobit,133F is perfectly cooked.

11-02-2019T16:31:08,Xexanoth,i just really can't stand the texture(?) of meat that's not cooked properly
11-02-2019T16:31:14,Mippy,I mean I won‚Äôt complain about well done steak ü•© but pink is how I prefer it
11-02-2019T16:32:03,Dadrobit,"Well done means you have to chew it. If it's not melting in the mouth, something has gone horribly wrong :D"
11-02-2019T16:32:18,SpazztasticKiwi,You‚Äôre supposed to chew all your food regardless
11-02-2019T16:32:25,Bgrmystr2,ITT ivory tower vs ivory tower.

11-02-2019T16:33:48,Bgrmystr2,haha
11-02-2019T16:34:13,Mippy,"Growing up it‚Äôs not like I could afford to be picky. Mom over cooked steak, you eat Moms over cooked steak and be thankful that you actually got steak that night instead of whatever Dad hit with the car"
11-02-2019T16:34:30,Dadrobit,I've only done a few less than child friendly jobs to be honest. But I will admit I have the most fun doing them.
11-02-2019T16:34:41,Mippy,We could use some lewd voice over
11-02-2019T16:35:35,Mippy,I can imagine those actors cracking up in the recording studio
11-02-2019T16:35:51,Dadrobit,My last gig of that nature was a bromance novel about two childhood friends who met up again later in life after going their separate ways.
11-02-2019T16:36:15,Dadrobit,It was actually surprisingly well written.
11-02-2019T16:36:44,Dadrobit,"And yes, can confirm. When working live with an engineer/other actors, giggle fit breaks are a thing."

11-02-2019T17:19:16,ThingsAreMoving,Seduction with awkwardness? Now that's something new.
11-02-2019T17:20:25,Dadrobit,Seduction and awkwardness. Reminds me of a microphone test I watched not so long ago where the guy took his microphone in the shower with him to demonstrate how sturdy it was in functioning even under terrible conditions.
11-02-2019T17:20:53,Dadrobit,He then stuffed it in a rolled up sock and threw it in his tumble dryer to dry it off.
11-02-2019T17:21:05,Dadrobit,It still works and I definitely want two.
11-02-2019T17:21:54,ThingsAreMoving,That's nokia level of indestructibility
11-02-2019T17:24:32,Mippy,Agrees
11-02-2019T17:25:04,Dadrobit,"It's a shotgun mic, one of those long skinny ones used to pick up specific sounds at a distance, or in an acoustically busy area. He did a bunch of distance tests as well and it really performed well. About $350 a mic IIRC."
11-02-2019T17:26:13,Dadrobit,Found it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEADaqIiun4&t=10m56s
11-02-2019T17:26:17,Mippy,That‚Äôs....more than I can afford in CAD.
11-02-2019T17:26:38,Mippy,I think I‚Äôm getting sick.
11-02-2019T17:28:50,Dadrobit,If I had the money...
11-02-2019T17:29:00,ThingsAreMoving,When he took that wind protection... damn
11-02-2019T17:29:12,ThingsAreMoving,A mic built to last
11-02-2019T17:29:23,Dadrobit,Headphone users beware btw lol
11-02-2019T17:29:37,ThingsAreMoving,Also sorry to hear that Mippy. Do get better soon.
11-02-2019T17:30:03,Dadrobit,The sound of it knocking in the dryer actually physically hurts me to hear.
11-02-2019T17:30:04,ThingsAreMoving,I'm on my headphones. Fortunately I have the volume turned pretty low
11-02-2019T17:30:22,Dadrobit,"Aye, hopefully itt's just a passing feeling Mippy."
11-02-2019T17:30:26,ThingsAreMoving,gonna skip the dryer part. the shower is more than enough
11-02-2019T17:30:37,Mippy,With me it‚Äôs usually a walking sickness so I‚Äôll probably be fine.
11-02-2019T17:30:47,ThingsAreMoving,I don't remember the last time I had a cold or the flu.
11-02-2019T17:31:04,ThingsAreMoving,I had pneumonia for 3 days on my last vacation.
11-02-2019T17:31:16,Mippy,Except that cold I got last year...had me out for three days.
11-02-2019T17:31:18,ThingsAreMoving,but that was last summer
11-02-2019T17:31:33,Dadrobit,He goes on to use it in the booth again and recording a park area with a studio pair. It sounds absolutely untouched.
11-02-2019T17:31:42,Mippy,That one got into my lungs
11-02-2019T17:32:34,ThingsAreMoving,lungs and upper airways are the worst to get infected
11-02-2019T17:32:45,ThingsAreMoving,"I don't mind the elevated temperature, or my hair aching"
11-02-2019T17:33:00,ThingsAreMoving,but miss me with being unable to breathe properly
11-02-2019T17:34:00,Mippy,I have breathing trouble anyway so I was basically bedridden.
11-02-2019T17:37:02,ThingsAreMoving,Asthma?
11-02-2019T17:38:23,Mippy,Side effects of a black mold infection I had as a child
11-02-2019T17:43:39,ThingsAreMoving,"ouch, black mold is no joke"
11-02-2019T17:47:47,Mippy,"Yeah, the 4-plex we lived in was full of it. We were too poor to afford anything else at the time. My favourite thing about it was barfing blood and having bits removed in surgery."
11-02-2019T17:48:38,Mippy,"Also, I got to drink a lot of banana flavoured penicillin"
11-02-2019T17:49:56,ThingsAreMoving,"Dang, hopefully no more of that mold business in your current dwelling?"
11-02-2019T17:51:16,Mippy,Not that I know of. The house was brand new when we got it.
11-02-2019T17:52:12,ThingsAreMoving,That's good. MAybe with time those side effects will subside too.
11-02-2019T17:52:45,ThingsAreMoving,"I mean, human body can basically regenerate almost everything, given time."
11-02-2019T17:53:58,Mippy,Maybe...I‚Äôll tell you if anything changes in the next 20 years.
11-02-2019T17:53:58,SpazztasticKiwi,This all that‚Äôs happened since my comment
11-02-2019T17:54:19,Mippy,Yup.
11-02-2019T17:54:22,ThingsAreMoving,"chaos, I tell ya."
11-02-2019T17:54:39,Mippy,"Also, I think I‚Äôm definitely sick"

11-02-2019T17:55:15,ThingsAreMoving,"...or whet the topic will change into, after several minutes, lol"
11-02-2019T17:56:13,ThingsAreMoving,"well then, as an adult you should know how to most efficiently unsick yourself Mippy. Do what ya need to get better."
11-02-2019T17:56:29,Mippy,Someone just left half a cucumber on the staff table at work.It‚Äôs strange because...why is it cut lengthwise?
11-02-2019T17:57:10,ThingsAreMoving,maybe someone wanted a cucumber without the seeds
11-02-2019T17:57:17,ThingsAreMoving,and took them out from the other half

11-02-2019T18:16:24,ThingsAreMoving,and awesome
11-02-2019T18:17:03,Bgrmystr2,"it has less damage per rocket to make up for it, but yeah it's more powerful than the Nukem if all 6 hit."
11-02-2019T18:17:16,SpazztasticKiwi,üìù
11-02-2019T18:17:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Uh huh. Go on
11-02-2019T18:18:21,SpazztasticKiwi,How much more bang do the 6 do than the one if they all hit
11-02-2019T18:18:25,Bgrmystr2,yeah.. 20% chance to spawn.. killed it 15 or so times now and nothin.
11-02-2019T18:18:28,Bgrmystr2,"not sure, actually"
11-02-2019T18:18:34,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, the wiki has all the numbers"
11-02-2019T18:18:40,ThingsAreMoving,they do six times more bang
11-02-2019T18:18:42,ThingsAreMoving,duh
11-02-2019T18:18:45,Bgrmystr2,lel no
11-02-2019T18:19:01,ThingsAreMoving,"yes, cause there's six of them. bang =! damage"
11-02-2019T18:19:17,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-wondering:
11-02-2019T18:19:25,Bgrmystr2,but the bang is smaller.
11-02-2019T18:19:40,SpazztasticKiwi,*whipers* pop
11-02-2019T18:19:43,ThingsAreMoving,"it's not the size of the bang, It's how much damage you deal with it"
11-02-2019T18:20:03,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs the train discussion all over again
11-02-2019T18:20:08,ThingsAreMoving,xD
11-02-2019T18:20:36,ThingsAreMoving,I'm not the one who wants to trade one big bang for six smaller ones
11-02-2019T18:21:34,Bgrmystr2,so like.. Nukem is a good 400k at lv 50 vs the badaboom 95k times 6
11-02-2019T18:21:42,Bgrmystr2,"I'm gonna use both anyway, but yeah"
11-02-2019T18:22:14,ThingsAreMoving,Demolition man
11-02-2019T18:22:36,Bgrmystr2,so it's like.. 1.475x approx
11-02-2019T18:22:47,Bgrmystr2,on the ones that have damage as the highest tier.
11-02-2019T18:22:58,Bgrmystr2,"or rather, as the ones that are exampled on the wiki"
11-02-2019T18:23:01,Bgrmystr2,but it'll be about that.
11-02-2019T18:24:47,ThingsAreMoving,I'm thinking what to suggest next.
11-02-2019T18:24:59,ThingsAreMoving,"fortunately I have 4 weeks to figure that out, lol"
11-02-2019T18:27:36,Bgrmystr2,got one after bout an hr
11-02-2019T18:28:05,Bgrmystr2,it's an acceptable one. It's prolly the 2nd best suited
11-02-2019T18:29:20,ThingsAreMoving,"I do have a list, about six suggestions on it. But can't decide which one to pick."
11-02-2019T18:29:50,ThingsAreMoving,"I might go with ""Origami Nibbly / Reni / Nora"" or a variation of it."
11-02-2019T18:37:56,CrRAR,Does it involve Clovis magicking Nibbly/Reni/Nora into an origami creature in a evil plot to neutralize their helpfulness in battle?

11-02-2019T18:57:12,CrRAR,are they still?
11-02-2019T18:57:13,Bgrmystr2,uh.. sorta kinda?
11-02-2019T18:57:45,Dadrobit,That surround sound needs to be handled in-game before hitting the headset or done in third party software if nothing else?
11-02-2019T18:58:03,Dadrobit,LTT just did a pretty solid video on explaining how all that works.
11-02-2019T18:58:10,Dadrobit,"And yes, they are bullshit."

11-02-2019T18:59:13,CrRAR,"yeah, I feel like it's just too many speakers too close together to actually simulate anything authentic enough to call itself ""surround"" sound."
11-02-2019T18:59:56,Dadrobit,"There's more to it than that, but yes, that is a part of it."
11-02-2019T19:00:30,CrRAR,mmm
11-02-2019T19:07:05,Dadrobit,"TLDW: No such thing as good ""gaming headsets"". Only good headsets that use good software simulation technology to bolster the experience."
11-02-2019T19:08:43,CrRAR,Yeah I could imagine the only impressive moments being when a explosion happens behind you. Like at the extremes. Everything else would probably just muddle together.
11-02-2019T19:09:48,Dadrobit,Quieter sounds like footsteps in your area and distant gunshots to pinpoint enemy locations before they're on top of you is important as well.
11-02-2019T19:11:02,CrRAR,"true, distinctly different sounds that you can track."
11-02-2019T19:11:24,Dadrobit,But many AAA games like Battlefield nowadays have that kind of software built in already anyways.

11-02-2019T21:49:17,RimaDraws,no
11-02-2019T21:52:22,Dadrobit,"With how much I kvetch about other folks not being creative? Yeah, I'm one of the baddies."
11-02-2019T21:52:36,Dadrobit,"Also, it pleases me that ""kvetch"" is an acceptable word."
11-02-2019T21:52:46,Ordithus,Got a link to the original book club?
11-02-2019T21:52:49,Ordithus,For maximum shame
11-02-2019T21:52:51,RimaDraws,i dont see you being nitpicky about others ideas

11-02-2019T21:53:29,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôll be bach.  Don‚Äôt have a ol much fun without me
11-02-2019T21:53:37,SpazztasticKiwi,too
11-02-2019T21:53:41,Dadrobit,shaaaaaaame
11-02-2019T21:53:44,Ordithus,"Ah, yes"
11-02-2019T21:54:27,Ordithus,"The new one has Sam, and is much less embarassing for Raine"
11-02-2019T21:54:37,Ordithus,"Really, yours is a prequel"
11-02-2019T21:55:18,Dadrobit,98% of the time my bullshittery about other folks' suggestions is tongue in cheek and fairly well meaning. Though there is the odd one or two that legitimately make me wonder.
11-02-2019T21:55:53,RimaDraws,hmm
11-02-2019T21:56:05,Dadrobit,"But that's the thing, Ord. Nobody liked the prequels!"
11-02-2019T21:56:22,RimaDraws,i do
11-02-2019T21:56:58,Ordithus,"Eh, the third one was pretty decent.  The first one is quite enjoyable if you take it as its own movie."
11-02-2019T21:57:05,Ordithus,And ignore Jar-Jar's survival
11-02-2019T21:57:38,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I didn't mind them either myself tbh. They came out when I was a youngin' and didn't know much else in the way of Star Wars."
11-02-2019T21:58:50,Ordithus,I should watch Solo and form my own opinion
11-02-2019T22:00:35,Dadrobit,"But don't get me wrong, I do enjoy what Tom did with my book club brunch meeting."
11-02-2019T22:03:47,Ordithus,It's cute
11-02-2019T22:09:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Well he‚Äôs been doin it for long enough he should have some sort of nik for it
11-02-2019T22:10:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Though he‚Äôs admitted to not knowing how to draw in the past so *squints*
11-02-2019T23:16:14,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
11-02-2019T23:25:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Nite
11-02-2019T23:26:20,SpazztasticKiwi,And so the numbers begin to fall üìâ
11-02-2019T23:28:26,SpazztasticKiwi,"Tom, curses for making me hungry now I got pizza rolls"
11-02-2019T23:51:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera just rolled over being cute and got his head stuck in the bedrame
11-02-2019T23:51:23,SpazztasticKiwi,bed frame
