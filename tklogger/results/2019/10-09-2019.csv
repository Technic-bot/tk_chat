10-09-2019T11:17:05,TerraTheWizard,i (poorly) drew a similar gag back in january https://www.deviantart.com/terrathewizard/art/Sythe-vs-Nibs-782686760
10-09-2019T11:31:56,SomeNiceUser,"Poorly drawn, yet still good Terra."
10-09-2019T11:51:06,SomeNiceUser,The laptop has finally arrived.

10-09-2019T12:05:56,SomeNiceUser,Cortana is very weird to have.
10-09-2019T12:06:33,TerraTheWizard,i turned her off
10-09-2019T12:18:30,CrimsonQuill,I try to use her
10-09-2019T12:18:39,CrimsonQuill,(that came out wrong)
10-09-2019T12:18:46,CrimsonQuill,I try to use the application
10-09-2019T12:18:53,CrimsonQuill,But there are problems
10-09-2019T12:19:00,CrimsonQuill,Such as not accepting commands.
10-09-2019T12:19:21,CrimsonQuill,"Which is really a shame, because I always think of Windows Cortana as an aspect of her Halo Namesake."
10-09-2019T12:20:02,SomeNiceUser,Yeah.
10-09-2019T12:20:17,SomeNiceUser,Ima go install steam.

10-09-2019T13:20:27,AspiringNoodle,"Just looked at my last 3 paychecks, not bad"
10-09-2019T13:20:46,AspiringNoodle,32 hours: $247.08
10-09-2019T13:20:55,AspiringNoodle,28 hours: $217.90
10-09-2019T13:21:01,AspiringNoodle,39 hours: $290.55
10-09-2019T13:21:44,AspiringNoodle,"So if I cap my hours at 30, I could expect a weekly paycheck around $230 :D"
10-09-2019T13:27:52,TerraTheWizard,think of all the lottery tickets you could buy :ctwokinds-keith8D:
10-09-2019T13:31:29,AspiringNoodle,"Meh, I had my binge of lottery / casino when I was younger, I got over it"
10-09-2019T13:32:02,AspiringNoodle,"Maybe I'll pick up scratch offs again because they're quite soothing, but I don't think I'll buy the big ones.  Maybe just the $2 - $5 range"
10-09-2019T14:31:20,CrimsonQuill,I'm off for the night
10-09-2019T14:31:23,CrimsonQuill,Sleep well

10-09-2019T15:08:13,tehbear,breif moment of silence
10-09-2019T15:08:20,tehbear,then rain again
10-09-2019T15:37:21,SomeNiceUser,I’m having a wonderful time with my new laptop.
10-09-2019T15:40:50,tehbear,what do you use it for?
10-09-2019T15:42:18,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-NoraEyebrows:
10-09-2019T15:44:51,SomeNiceUser,Gaming.

10-09-2019T17:25:53,SpazztasticKiwi,alone since 3 I leave at 9 and no closer
10-09-2019T17:35:27,AspiringNoodle,I'll need to talk to my manager about my hours :ptv-unimpressed:
10-09-2019T17:36:17,AspiringNoodle,"While I may not have worked 35 hours this / last week due to illness.  Counting next week, the last 4 / 6 weeks since I've been hired I'll have been scheduled for 35 hours a week"
10-09-2019T17:36:23,AspiringNoodle,"So much for being ""part-time"", huh?"
10-09-2019T17:51:36,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
10-09-2019T17:55:32,AspiringNoodle,"Sleep tight, yah glorious bastard :3"
10-09-2019T19:59:06,RimaDraws,Hey
10-09-2019T19:59:28,AspiringNoodle,Hiiiiiii :ptv-hearts:
10-09-2019T19:59:45,AspiringNoodle,"Rima, tell me, am I wrong for wanting less hours?"
10-09-2019T20:00:01,AspiringNoodle,Part of me says more hours = more money.  I'm getting more than I could ever want.
10-09-2019T20:00:30,AspiringNoodle,"But the other part of me says this is a retail job, and that I could use my time to get skills for a better job :/"
10-09-2019T20:27:56,RimaDraws,I don’t know. I left retail for factory work.
10-09-2019T20:30:30,AspiringNoodle,"I have a decent figure to go off of, at least"
10-09-2019T20:30:39,AspiringNoodle,30 hours at my current wage is $230 or so a week
10-09-2019T20:33:43,AspiringNoodle,"Or ~$12,000 a year"
10-09-2019T20:38:44,AspiringNoodle,"Or ""retail sucks balls"" :ptv-snicker:"
10-09-2019T21:19:15,RimaDraws,I can’t survive on $230 a week
10-09-2019T21:22:33,AspiringNoodle,"If I wasn't in my current situation, it'd probably be the same story"
10-09-2019T21:23:31,AspiringNoodle,"I want to get a better job asap.  Don't want to be around when retail finally implodes, lol"
10-09-2019T21:59:54,SpazztasticKiwi,uh
10-09-2019T22:00:21,SpazztasticKiwi,how bad do you need to take a pregnancy test that you take it straight in the walmart bathroom
10-09-2019T22:02:11,AspiringNoodle,I can not think of any situation outside of something outlandish for a movie / show
10-09-2019T22:03:03,AspiringNoodle,"Mmmm, so much thunder outside"
10-09-2019T22:03:07,AspiringNoodle,Ima sleep good tonight <3
