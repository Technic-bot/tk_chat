04-10-2019T00:06:49,ZRO4825,"Can't help it, Lann, some games just play better with a controller...unless you're a Bowgun, or potentially Bow user...then I could see using kb/mouse"
04-10-2019T00:06:50,LannAF,I have no idea who it is either.
04-10-2019T00:06:52,Kynum,@LordKefik

04-10-2019T00:07:17,ZRO4825,"But for any of the melee weapons? Keyboard controls are just bleh for that game, lol"
04-10-2019T00:07:23,AspiringNoodle,smoke bombs into the night
04-10-2019T00:07:24,Kynum,thanks :3
04-10-2019T00:07:26,LannAF,I'll learn most default control schemes and never switch off keyboard.

04-10-2019T00:07:46,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Lann I dare you to beat dark souls with a keyboard and mouse
04-10-2019T00:07:49,LannAF,dark souls 1 took me 2 days to get out of the starter area purely from learning
04-10-2019T00:07:50,ZRO4825,"Hey, if it works for you, cool. I tried the keyboard and just couldn't with that game. Their control scheme is so frackin weird, lol"
04-10-2019T00:07:52,LannAF,bahahahaha marv
04-10-2019T00:07:55,JeremySenpai,Bai Noodle

04-10-2019T00:08:02,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Have you fought Midir yet?
04-10-2019T00:08:18,LannAF,"2 days to learn the controls, 2 days in the first area nonstop"
04-10-2019T00:08:24,ZRO4825,"....damnit, this talk is making me wanna play more MHW :joy:"

04-10-2019T00:08:32,LannAF,I've only done dark souls 1 and 2
04-10-2019T00:08:35,ZRO4825,I'd sat it down for about a week now due to burnout from grinding. XD
04-10-2019T00:08:36,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Midir the abyss dragon
04-10-2019T00:08:38,MarvTheHugPharaoh,ds3

04-10-2019T00:08:51,LannAF,I..Don't know why
04-10-2019T00:08:59,LannAF,The souls games lost my interest as they went on kinda.
04-10-2019T00:09:04,LannAF,DS1 was my favorite
04-10-2019T00:09:05,SageSaga,i kept asking you to play DS3 with me but you never did
04-10-2019T00:09:07,ZRO4825,"Nioh > Dark Souls for me. Something about the way Dark Souls handles just irks me, lol"
04-10-2019T00:09:11,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hidetaka Miyazaki siad Midir was his fuck you to anyone saying dark souls 3 was easy
04-10-2019T00:09:12,LannAF,"like I said, I lost interest."
04-10-2019T00:09:20,SageSaga,so i ended up going to NG+6 all by myself
04-10-2019T00:09:24,ZRO4825,"Speaking of which, I want more info on Nioh 2 damnit."

04-10-2019T00:10:39,LannAF,man I get gifted a lot of games come to think of it.

04-10-2019T00:13:42,LannAF,sage
04-10-2019T00:13:48,SpazztasticKiwi,lann playing alien I imagine is a huddled mass in some corner of the room making constant prayer noises

04-10-2019T00:32:56,LannAF,is that why???
04-10-2019T00:32:58,SpazztasticKiwi,especially since it’s interrupting the stream in a way with something not pertaining to it

04-10-2019T00:33:19,Dadrobit,Spazz the type of driver to have the right of way and still wait for the other driver to wave them
04-10-2019T00:33:29,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Oh god
04-10-2019T00:33:30,SageSaga,So i said - screw it- describe it - post it- if you lie- you get banned
04-10-2019T00:33:32,ZRO4825,"Also, Bagheera looks just like my old kitty Shadow, and I love that. <3"
04-10-2019T00:33:36,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I hate that people do that dad
04-10-2019T00:34:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera’s also alot more chill with being dressed up
04-10-2019T00:34:14,MarvTheHugPharaoh,hecking aww
04-10-2019T00:34:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve once balanced a pair of nail clippers on his head and he Did Not Care
04-10-2019T00:34:29,Ordithus,"black cats are better for allergies, right?"
04-10-2019T00:34:39,Dadrobit,The worst are the ones that slow almost to a stop on the on ramp to the freeway before trying to merge. Legit fuck those people.
04-10-2019T00:34:40,SpazztasticKiwi,far as I know I’m not allergic
04-10-2019T00:34:56,LannAF,I'm allergic to cats
04-10-2019T00:34:58,SageSaga,black cats live longer naturally because the absorb so much sunlight
04-10-2019T00:35:01,LannAF,used to be deathly allergic
04-10-2019T00:35:04,LannAF,now it's just itchiness
04-10-2019T00:35:07,LannAF,doesn't stop me.
04-10-2019T00:35:18,Ordithus,cats were why my childhood was not breathing
04-10-2019T00:35:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I only have Bagheera because he was found abandoned in a mcdonalds parking lot and the shelter we tried to take him to didn’t want a black cat
04-10-2019T00:35:35,Ordithus,whaaaat
04-10-2019T00:35:37,SageSaga,my joke was ruined because i typed the instead of they

04-10-2019T00:36:05,LannAF,aw Kiwwi :C
04-10-2019T00:36:24,SpazztasticKiwi,that look he’s giving in the picture is because he didn’t particularly want to sit still for the picture
04-10-2019T00:36:27,JeremySenpai,God I wanna draw this Sour out fit that is in this Miku vid
04-10-2019T00:36:30,SpazztasticKiwi,he wanted to eat the flowers

04-10-2019T00:37:57,Dadrobit,Fake it til you make it. S'what I do.
04-10-2019T00:38:09,SageSaga,they are just frills - they cant hurt you
04-10-2019T00:38:09,LannAF,Ash asked to play dead by daylight rn

04-10-2019T00:41:49,SageSaga,he stood us both up - but i was the hopeful one- i was the one saying he'd be there soon! HE PROMISED
04-10-2019T00:42:05,Dadrobit,"Oh, speaking of, almost forgot to ask a question real quick. What was the mic you used to model w/ Oreo?"
04-10-2019T00:42:09,SageSaga,Even when he was an hour late...
04-10-2019T00:42:10,SpazztasticKiwi,...I also have a then and now picture of Bagheera from when he was found to his last birthday
04-10-2019T00:42:26,Dadrobit,Just out of curiosity.
04-10-2019T00:42:28,MarvTheHugPharaoh,tonor bm700
04-10-2019T00:42:39,MarvTheHugPharaoh,the one I use that I got for 30 bucks
04-10-2019T00:42:56,MarvTheHugPharaoh,wait
04-10-2019T00:43:01,Dadrobit,With a neewar?
04-10-2019T00:43:05,MarvTheHugPharaoh,no I was wrong
04-10-2019T00:43:32,SageSaga,nuts
04-10-2019T00:43:34,MarvTheHugPharaoh,sennheiser mke 600
04-10-2019T00:43:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,The tonor was the sketch
04-10-2019T00:43:50,Dadrobit,"Was gonna say, looked like a shotgun. Tonor 700 looks like a regulars cadioid."
04-10-2019T00:43:59,MarvTheHugPharaoh,it is
04-10-2019T00:44:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,half way through I was like...... This mic is to cheep so I looked up shotgun mics
04-10-2019T00:44:42,Dadrobit,There is a tragic lack of Senheiser gear in my collection alas.
04-10-2019T00:45:35,Dadrobit,"Almost entirely Shure. With a smattering of CAD, Focusrite, and Røde"
04-10-2019T00:45:57,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I have the tonor and thats it. :)
04-10-2019T00:46:07,BluePhantom90,hey Kynum
04-10-2019T00:46:22,Dadrobit,I... Spend too much on gear tbh.
04-10-2019T00:46:29,Kynum,"sup, Blue"
04-10-2019T00:47:21,Dadrobit,Just got a new set of IEMs. Shure Se215. So good. Almost completely unnecessary.
04-10-2019T00:47:39,Dadrobit,Almost.
04-10-2019T00:49:18,BluePhantom90,NM how about you man?
04-10-2019T00:49:32,Kynum,I'm doin' ok
04-10-2019T00:49:41,BluePhantom90,good good
04-10-2019T00:50:49,Kynum,"sorry, guys. Tryin' to decide on a background."
04-10-2019T00:50:52,Kynum,well...
04-10-2019T00:50:55,Kynum,in the mean time...
04-10-2019T00:50:59,Dadrobit,Turns out it was actually a pretty decent investment. Had some cheap Sony buds that over represented the lows. Then I had AKG buds that completely lacked the lows and highs. The 215s are my Goldilocks now.
04-10-2019T00:52:05,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I got some up there in price sony's that I'v been running for years now.
04-10-2019T00:52:39,Ordithus,how does Amazon know my roommate broke my coffee press
04-10-2019T00:52:54,Ordithus,"I mean, I know they know everything, but wow"
04-10-2019T00:53:12,JeremySenpai,O.o Thanks for the follow Katliea. :ptv-excited:
04-10-2019T00:53:13,LordKefik,Alexa is a blabbermouth
04-10-2019T00:53:22,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I honestly still use my Sony buds from time to time for some music."
04-10-2019T00:53:35,Ordithus,I don't have Alexa :ptv-uneasy:
04-10-2019T00:54:16,Dadrobit,They were like $30 at Walmart years ago. Solid investment.
04-10-2019T00:54:50,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"mine were also 30 bucks, off amazon"
04-10-2019T00:55:33,Dadrobit,"And by our powers combined, we are... Consumers!"
04-10-2019T00:55:39,MarvTheHugPharaoh,\o/

04-10-2019T01:05:12,SeLaRZ,:ptv-wondering:
04-10-2019T01:05:44,SageSaga,hmmm
04-10-2019T01:05:48,SageSaga,this boy pretty enough?
04-10-2019T01:05:55,Kynum,x3
04-10-2019T01:06:05,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I'd cuddle
04-10-2019T01:06:05,Ordithus,"Haha, I was with Nyna at first"
04-10-2019T01:06:44,JeremySenpai,Oh you didn't poof. How are you Sela?
04-10-2019T01:07:14,JeremySenpai,Dats a boi Sage?
04-10-2019T01:07:33,SageSaga,Elf Boy
04-10-2019T01:07:33,Dadrobit,Guy
04-10-2019T01:07:35,SeLaRZ,tried
04-10-2019T01:07:40,SeLaRZ,and cant draw
04-10-2019T01:07:47,Ordithus,"He's like, several hundred years old"
04-10-2019T01:07:48,SeLaRZ,so usual i guess
04-10-2019T01:07:59,JeremySenpai,I guess Elf Boi has cuteness
04-10-2019T01:08:00,Ordithus,The wonders of moisturizer
04-10-2019T01:08:19,JeremySenpai,Yeah I feel Sela. I have my usual headache
04-10-2019T01:08:24,SageSaga,320 years old
04-10-2019T01:08:38,JeremySenpai,So just a youngin then
04-10-2019T01:08:44,SageSaga,yep
04-10-2019T01:10:07,Dadrobit,"Pubery must suck. Like, just untold years of pube beards and ""It's not a phase!"""
04-10-2019T01:10:21,Dadrobit,Puberty*
04-10-2019T01:10:52,SageSaga,Elves dont get bubes
04-10-2019T01:10:55,Ordithus,decades of voice cracks
04-10-2019T01:10:56,SageSaga,pubes*
04-10-2019T01:11:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,This dude ain't got no bubes
04-10-2019T01:11:27,Dadrobit,How.... How do we know this???
04-10-2019T01:11:46,MarvTheHugPharaoh,We must investigate
04-10-2019T01:11:52,JeremySenpai,then how do the elder Elves have beards
04-10-2019T01:11:54,Ordithus,for science
04-10-2019T01:12:01,SageSaga,they dont
04-10-2019T01:12:12,MarvTheHugPharaoh,prove it
04-10-2019T01:12:35,Dadrobit,They stole them from humans. The superior facial hair race
04-10-2019T01:12:37,JeremySenpai,:thinking:
04-10-2019T01:13:22,Dadrobit,There's a Harry's brand sponsorship somewhere in this conversation
04-10-2019T01:13:42,SageSaga,almost all the 900+ elves are dead- but at least in this- Elves dont have facial hair- and we all know pubic  hair is just facial hair for your privates
04-10-2019T01:14:12,Ordithus,or is it the other way round
04-10-2019T01:14:15,SageSaga,also Nyna knows
04-10-2019T01:14:28,Dadrobit,I feel like there are some women that would have something to say here.
04-10-2019T01:14:58,Dadrobit,Facial hair isn't exactly a prerequisite
04-10-2019T01:14:59,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I still need more evidence
04-10-2019T01:15:03,SageSaga,some women get facial hair too
04-10-2019T01:16:21,JeremySenpai,^usually after child birth
04-10-2019T01:17:34,Mihari,"I'm not sure on factors and what not, but I am jusy happy I have none... yet. It's almost a sure thing for most as you get older and older."
04-10-2019T01:17:56,SageSaga,it has to do with androgen i think
04-10-2019T01:18:41,SageSaga,its been many years since ive looked into it tbh- point is - Elves dont have pubes or facial hair!
04-10-2019T01:18:58,MarvTheHugPharaoh,they must be really cold
04-10-2019T01:19:36,SageSaga,they are naturally resilient to temperatures more so than humans
04-10-2019T01:19:51,Dadrobit,Do.... Do furries get pubes? I know I've seen some with beards...
04-10-2019T01:20:17,Dadrobit,"Just fyi, even I don't like this conversation. But, ya know. Science."
04-10-2019T01:20:19,MarvTheHugPharaoh,furries with pubes seems redundant
04-10-2019T01:20:55,JeremySenpai,:fearful::scream::thinking:
04-10-2019T01:21:16,Dadrobit,I have not done research into this area and I don't plan on it. But I know some of these people are... Different...
04-10-2019T01:21:27,Ordithus,Tom draws em with plenty o chest floof
04-10-2019T01:22:41,JeremySenpai,Welp I have lost (another) discussion with my wife about who is going to the shops.
04-10-2019T01:22:43,Dadrobit,R/furrieswithpubes sounds like it could be real.
04-10-2019T01:23:04,JeremySenpai,So I will BRB 10-20 mins
04-10-2019T01:23:05,Ordithus,Mike is a bit fluffy... down there... http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/454/
04-10-2019T01:23:47,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I like how you took the time to look at furry crotch for us
04-10-2019T01:24:03,Ordithus,haha you're welcome
04-10-2019T01:24:15,Dadrobit,Such bravery
04-10-2019T01:25:27,AnuSekaniArt,XD
04-10-2019T01:31:19,Dadrobit,"Shit, my night might be ruined."
04-10-2019T01:31:30,MarvTheHugPharaoh,0_0
04-10-2019T01:31:54,Dadrobit,"Just realized that instead of picking up Chicken Alfredo, I accidentally bought Salisbury steak..."
04-10-2019T01:32:12,Ordithus,how
04-10-2019T01:32:12,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Big oof
04-10-2019T01:32:27,SageSaga,that's nothing
04-10-2019T01:32:42,SageSaga,get this- a couple weeks ago- we were going to get Chinese!
04-10-2019T01:32:57,SageSaga,I normally cant get Chinese- but this one place has something that just barely fits in my diet
04-10-2019T01:33:02,SageSaga,i never get to go there though
04-10-2019T01:33:14,SageSaga,so we go- we get there- it's closed
04-10-2019T01:33:29,Dadrobit,RIP
04-10-2019T01:33:31,SageSaga,So what do we do? We end up at a freakn Pizzaria!
04-10-2019T01:33:42,SageSaga,There is NOTHING i can eat at a PIZZARIA!
04-10-2019T01:33:43,Dadrobit,Thats hella bad for gerd
04-10-2019T01:34:05,SageSaga,i drank water- and watched the rest of my family devour 2 large pizzas
04-10-2019T01:35:15,Kynum,that sucks
04-10-2019T01:35:49,SageSaga,"Nephew 1 - ""Why isn't uncle phil eating?"" ""Because if he eats pizza he'll die"" Nephew 2 - ""Have some Pizza uncle Phil!"""
04-10-2019T01:36:00,Ordithus,oh dear
04-10-2019T01:36:18,SageSaga,EVEN IF I DIE YOU CANT HAVE MY NINTENDO SWITCH YA LITTLE BRAT!
04-10-2019T01:36:19,Dadrobit,"Welp, I join you in spirit. One bit of this. Literally unfit for human consumption."
04-10-2019T01:36:20,DarthRexKing,Family full of idiots?
04-10-2019T01:36:28,Dadrobit,Lol sage.
04-10-2019T01:36:36,Dadrobit,Bite*
04-10-2019T01:36:47,Dadrobit,Into the trash.
04-10-2019T01:36:54,Ordithus,"that is sad, robit"
04-10-2019T01:37:19,Dadrobit,"No worries, I'll just skip on tea for the night."
04-10-2019T01:37:21,MarvTheHugPharaoh,That
04-10-2019T01:37:26,Dadrobit,Sip*
04-10-2019T01:37:29,MarvTheHugPharaoh,right that is my new fave nyna face
04-10-2019T01:37:50,Ordithus,:csagesaga-nynastare:
04-10-2019T01:38:02,Ordithus,She's good at the expressions cats are good at
04-10-2019T01:40:20,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Thats the face of someones who had a Draw 4 played on them and they are like ""Where, the fuck are you hiding these?"""
04-10-2019T01:41:27,Dadrobit,No joke. Does anyone actually like Salisbury steak? My whole damn house smells like shitty ground beef and onion now...
04-10-2019T01:41:42,Ordithus,it is food
04-10-2019T01:42:22,Dadrobit,"""food"". Cyanide can be food at least once in a lifetime."
04-10-2019T01:42:41,SageSaga,no it cant
04-10-2019T01:43:03,SageSaga,you have to be able to absorb it for nutritional value to count as food
04-10-2019T01:43:35,DarthRexKing,"Goodnight all, at least my meals today went better. Same will go for you, Sage. :V"
04-10-2019T01:43:43,Kynum,"later, Rex"
04-10-2019T01:43:44,Dadrobit,Is there a good version of Salisbury? Honest question. Is it just because I bought cheap?
04-10-2019T01:43:54,Dadrobit,o/ Darth
04-10-2019T01:43:59,SageSaga,yes Dadrobit
04-10-2019T01:44:02,DarthRexKing,:>
04-10-2019T01:44:13,SageSaga,most foods have a good version
04-10-2019T01:45:07,Dadrobit,"Like, I've had more expensive versions (read $3) and it still tastes crap. But I didn't/don't know if this stuff exists outside of frozen meals."
04-10-2019T01:45:24,SageSaga,in general- i would probably just cook it so it taste like a burger XD
04-10-2019T01:45:28,Ordithus,"it does, you can make it fresh if you want"
04-10-2019T01:45:45,Ordithus,burger with gravy on it is about as good as salisbury steak would get I expect
04-10-2019T01:46:39,SageSaga,yeah you can also use all sorts of different gravy too- even flavored with like steak sauce or a bbq sauce and it should still count
04-10-2019T01:46:52,Dadrobit,"If you're working with a good burger meat in the first place, then why gravy???"
04-10-2019T01:47:35,JeremySenpai,Slides back in
04-10-2019T01:47:36,Dadrobit,And is it Salisbury steak if you're using BBQ sauce?
04-10-2019T01:47:43,Ordithus,wb jeremy
04-10-2019T01:47:44,SageSaga,yes
04-10-2019T01:48:32,JeremySenpai,Tom hanks Ord
04-10-2019T01:49:02,Dadrobit,o/ sen
04-10-2019T01:49:10,SageSaga,the only thing that really sets the Salisbury steak apart is the inclusion of onions and green peppers in the meat
04-10-2019T01:49:29,SageSaga,otherwise its a hamburger steak served with gravy
04-10-2019T01:49:41,SageSaga,and the gravy can be mixed with other stuff
04-10-2019T01:50:53,SageSaga,do you like meat loaf?
04-10-2019T01:51:25,SageSaga,i kinda miss meatloaf...
04-10-2019T01:51:36,SageSaga,im not a big fan of it- but i liked it occassionally
04-10-2019T01:51:37,JeremySenpai,:ptv-grossedout:
04-10-2019T01:51:43,JeremySenpai,my waifu made it once
04-10-2019T01:51:45,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"♪The sirens are screaming, and the fires are howling Way down in the valley tonight♪"
04-10-2019T01:51:54,JeremySenpai,like eating saw dust
04-10-2019T01:51:58,SageSaga,generally if you have had it and didnt like it- you didnt have good meatloaf
04-10-2019T01:52:00,Dadrobit,Not my first choice certainly. But I'll eat it if someone plates it for me.
04-10-2019T01:52:09,SageSaga,yeaaaah thats all kindas wrong Jeremy
04-10-2019T01:52:35,JeremySenpai,Oh thank god
04-10-2019T01:52:42,JeremySenpai,i thought my taste was off
04-10-2019T01:52:56,JeremySenpai,turns out she is just a bad cook :ptv-nope:
04-10-2019T01:52:57,Dadrobit,"I've had good meatloaf before, but even good meatloaf is meh to me compared to other foods"
04-10-2019T01:53:23,Dadrobit,Just personal preference I think.
04-10-2019T01:53:44,JeremySenpai,deletes that incase she walks past
04-10-2019T01:53:52,SageSaga,we would make meatloaf and then after cook it- slice it and grill it with a honey bbq sauce
04-10-2019T01:54:17,SageSaga,and somehow- not get diabetius
04-10-2019T01:55:20,Dadrobit,"Yeah, we have a similar version. My sister makes a bitchin homemade ketchup. Simmer that for a bit mixing in some local honey, then spread it on the meatloaf."
04-10-2019T01:55:25,Mihari,"Darn you all, made me hungry."

04-10-2019T02:19:14,MarvTheHugPharaoh,what a pro strat
04-10-2019T02:19:25,Dadrobit,Enhance the effect with some NyQuil and Chase it with a shot of bourbon for maximum effect!
04-10-2019T02:19:53,BadFoMo,That doesn't sound like a good idea.
04-10-2019T02:20:25,Dadrobit,Never said it was a good idea. Just that it works.

04-10-2019T03:04:03,JeremySenpai,:cjeremysenpai-coffee: Change My mind
04-10-2019T03:04:20,SageSaga,Mark Hamill
04-10-2019T03:04:25,MarvTheHugPharaoh,^
04-10-2019T03:04:30,Dadrobit,Was gonna say
04-10-2019T03:04:46,JeremySenpai,Is overrated!

04-10-2019T03:04:54,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Heath Ledger was great, joaquin phoenix I hear is amazing.  Mark Hamill is the OG"
04-10-2019T03:05:30,Mihari,And just like that Jeremy lost all future invites! :o
04-10-2019T03:05:32,EunhaGrey,thanks for having me <3
04-10-2019T03:05:57,JeremySenpai,Ok look as the only cartoon joker Mark is unsurpassed.
04-10-2019T03:06:12,Dadrobit,Also video game
04-10-2019T03:06:20,SpazztasticKiwi,"whichever one it is that they want to rave is the sexiest and best boyfriend, I heard pass"
04-10-2019T03:06:24,SpazztasticKiwi,hard
04-10-2019T03:06:25,JeremySenpai,but the depth of crazy Heath took the audience is hard to get passed
04-10-2019T03:06:26,Mihari,It's more aptly said Mark is the best Joker VOICE.
04-10-2019T03:06:37,JeremySenpai,^
04-10-2019T03:07:00,JeremySenpai,Welcome Eunha

04-10-2019T03:07:09,Mihari,Slime girl!
04-10-2019T03:07:19,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Fun Fact, Troy Baker was the joker for one of the Arkham games because Mark was busy,  Almost no one noticed."
04-10-2019T03:07:22,SageSaga,We'll never know if Heath was actually a good Joker or just lucky
04-10-2019T03:07:22,JeremySenpai,What cute Gril is gonna get slimed?
04-10-2019T03:07:39,EunhaGrey,not sure but I want monster girls today uAu
04-10-2019T03:08:07,BadFoMo,Hmm; for once I'm not the odd one out. Mark is my Joker too.
04-10-2019T03:08:08,JeremySenpai,are you suggesting that he is given more credit because he died before more could be made?
04-10-2019T03:09:39,SageSaga,im suggesting that its possible for someone to give a great performance and be unable to replicate it- and now we'll never know- but Mark has been doing it over and over for years and nails it every time
04-10-2019T03:09:48,Dadrobit,I think it's more that it's hard to sell something when it's impossible to tell if he was a one bit wonder if not.
04-10-2019T03:10:16,SageSaga,which is why i easily give it to Mark
04-10-2019T03:11:17,JeremySenpai,Fair Point. I still Prefer Heath for twisted motives over Marks Insanity
04-10-2019T03:11:40,SageSaga,he wasnt insane- he was hypersane

04-10-2019T03:13:00,SageSaga,he was aware that he was a comic book character and that he was a villain - and his personality was to entertain and creep out- so he played it up as best as he could

04-10-2019T04:03:00,SageSaga,nah- they want Rieko dressed up as him- which to me is weird- like - . . . why?
04-10-2019T04:04:17,SageSaga,his costume isnt exactly interesting
04-10-2019T04:04:37,Kagiyama89,"looking wonderful, eun :ptv-hearts:"
04-10-2019T04:04:41,Mihari,That's like asking why people want Fox genderbent and put in Samus's zero suit.
04-10-2019T04:05:13,JeremySenpai,:cjeremysenpai-unzip: never know what turns someones key
04-10-2019T04:05:28,SpazztasticKiwi,cold

04-10-2019T04:06:10,ZRO4825,Those suck.
04-10-2019T04:06:58,SageSaga,i dunno- they can be pretty good when its crazy hot out
04-10-2019T04:07:05,sunblaze,ok my request the brown hiared elf from AI:elven issues 19 is my target for this years halloween shinigans. put her in a costome of your choice
04-10-2019T04:07:44,SageSaga,Mihari?
04-10-2019T04:08:32,Mihari,Uhhh...
04-10-2019T04:08:43,Mihari,You mean red haired?
04-10-2019T04:08:57,sunblaze,yes its a bit red
04-10-2019T04:09:02,sunblaze,and thats your cameo?
04-10-2019T04:09:12,sunblaze,I was unaware of that
04-10-2019T04:09:20,SageSaga,it's one of her D&D characters XD
04-10-2019T04:09:38,sunblaze,are you OK with that request then Mihari?
04-10-2019T04:09:41,SageSaga,i needed a woodelf for the background and i didnt have a design
04-10-2019T04:10:04,SageSaga,it's a sketch btw Mihari
04-10-2019T04:10:16,Mihari,"Yah I know, I'm thinking of an outfit."
04-10-2019T04:10:23,sunblaze,;P
04-10-2019T04:10:26,Mihari,I'm fine with it.
04-10-2019T04:10:50,sunblaze,cool I love bringing minor chars back into view
04-10-2019T04:11:12,SageSaga,wth...
04-10-2019T04:11:16,Mihari,XD
04-10-2019T04:11:27,SageSaga,that was odd
04-10-2019T04:13:24,Kagiyama89,mya mya! <3
04-10-2019T04:13:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Nighty night y'all, thanks for the streamys you guys"
04-10-2019T04:13:44,SageSaga,oh yeah- My mother asked a while back if she could buy one of my books
04-10-2019T04:13:49,SageSaga,gnight Marv
04-10-2019T04:13:50,EunhaGrey,nini Marv~
04-10-2019T04:14:07,sunblaze,advertise her all of them :D
04-10-2019T04:14:18,sunblaze,ciao marv
04-10-2019T04:14:27,SageSaga,"I told her- she didnt want to buy one of my books. She said ""Yes i do"" and then i tried the mind trick again- ""You dont want to buy one of my books"""
04-10-2019T04:14:40,SageSaga,she hasnt come for a book yet- so i think it worked
04-10-2019T04:15:53,sunblaze,I don't think she would mind. she is aware of your extensive imagination. (which is a good thing)
04-10-2019T04:15:57,sunblaze,so imho thats fine
04-10-2019T04:16:33,SageSaga,"my mother is not anti-gay, but she is certainly not pro-gay XD"
04-10-2019T04:17:34,EunhaGrey,www
04-10-2019T04:17:41,EunhaGrey,traditional mom?
04-10-2019T04:18:38,SpazztasticKiwi,what’s she gonna do
04-10-2019T04:18:42,SpazztasticKiwi,ground you?
04-10-2019T04:19:02,SageSaga,no i just dont want to hand my mother a book with two girls having sex
04-10-2019T04:19:15,EunhaGrey,LOL fair
04-10-2019T04:19:25,JeremySenpai,pfffft
04-10-2019T04:19:28,SpazztasticKiwi,and all from her baby boys brain
04-10-2019T04:19:32,SpazztasticKiwi,so proud
04-10-2019T04:20:03,SageSaga,if she asks again im going to inform her the comic is science fiction- that should scare her away from asking
04-10-2019T04:20:12,sunblaze,just give her the regular comic then. all it has is mages with plenty of giant boobs
04-10-2019T04:20:16,sunblaze,among other things :D
04-10-2019T04:20:28,SpazztasticKiwi,an even worse scenario - she has notes for your writing
04-10-2019T04:20:34,JeremySenpai,be up front. Mom it's got gay in it.
04-10-2019T04:20:35,SageSaga,XD i guess i could tear out a few pages?
04-10-2019T04:20:46,JeremySenpai,are you sure you want to see it?
04-10-2019T04:21:37,SageSaga,"""Mom- it has lesbians"" ""Well yeah-"" ""You knew?"" ""Ive seen your drawings"" ""Well this is a lot more-"" ""OMG you drew PORN didnt you?!"" ""NO!"""
04-10-2019T04:21:37,SpazztasticKiwi,“son I read your comic an- where’d he go”
04-10-2019T04:21:55,sunblaze,^I can see that
04-10-2019T04:24:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"“based on the beginning of that sentence, he’s somewhere between Jupiter and Neptune"
04-10-2019T04:25:01,Kagiyama89,:ptv-laugh:
04-10-2019T04:25:18,JeremySenpai,went all harry potter and is hiding in the corner under a cloak
04-10-2019T04:25:24,SageSaga,"""Mom! Im a grown man! and i can do what I want and you-"" ""Can judge you for it"" ""W-what?"""
04-10-2019T04:25:27,SpazztasticKiwi,or he simply burned up from embarrassment
04-10-2019T04:26:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I could seriously see myself getting a sit down with any son I had doing a comic like that and being like “I have some pointers...”
04-10-2019T04:27:12,SageSaga,"""This comic is very unrealistic- if i were there i'd walk right up to her and tear those fake ears off her!"" ""Mom- shes an elf- those are her real ears-"" ""I'd still do it"" ""Dark"""
04-10-2019T04:27:24,JeremySenpai,O.o Chottoe Mattee
04-10-2019T04:27:42,JeremySenpai,Spaz is a gril?
04-10-2019T04:28:12,SpazztasticKiwi,when will this not be a revelation
04-10-2019T04:28:16,SpazztasticKiwi,yes
04-10-2019T04:28:29,SpazztasticKiwi,I am a female of the species
04-10-2019T04:28:54,JeremySenpai,Blushes and hides
04-10-2019T04:29:22,AnimationNexus,kinda figured
04-10-2019T04:29:31,SpazztasticKiwi,"“if I scratch her ears, is it casual or does she get h-“ “MOM NO!”"
04-10-2019T04:29:56,JeremySenpai,Jk to make it eaiser i just picture everyone a anime loli grill until I am otherwise informed.
04-10-2019T04:30:28,SpazztasticKiwi,so... you imagine a doll?
04-10-2019T04:31:05,EunhaGrey,can I be a muscular loli
04-10-2019T04:31:09,ThingsAreMoving,o/ what's goin' on over here
04-10-2019T04:31:12,sunblaze,so she would pick on Kailyns ears but non on Nynas cat ears?
04-10-2019T04:31:38,SpazztasticKiwi,because she’s scary?
04-10-2019T04:31:48,SageSaga,she would see that as abusing an animal probably
04-10-2019T04:32:06,SageSaga,she hated Spock
04-10-2019T04:32:09,JeremySenpai,https://i.imgur.com/klgg2LZ.mp4 More like this SFW
04-10-2019T04:32:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m tired but this got interesting
04-10-2019T04:32:23,sunblaze,but spock loves spot!
04-10-2019T04:32:33,sunblaze,despite fact spot was caged onto a starship
04-10-2019T04:33:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I mean I’m a brunette but there’s not much more likeness
04-10-2019T04:33:28,sunblaze,thats great Jeremy. I could be that as well :D
04-10-2019T04:35:03,SpazztasticKiwi,pear lady?
04-10-2019T04:35:17,JeremySenpai,loodly lick his second icy pole for the day
04-10-2019T04:35:30,SpazztasticKiwi,🗞
04-10-2019T04:37:47,Kagiyama89,:newspaper2:
04-10-2019T04:37:47,JeremySenpai,"wait, there is gonna be another avengers movie?"
04-10-2019T04:38:24,SageSaga,probably
04-10-2019T04:39:28,AnimationNexus,wtf
04-10-2019T04:39:54,SageSaga,with so many people that are considered Avengers you might as well just consider any big team up movie to be an Avengers Movie
04-10-2019T04:40:18,SageSaga,*In the marvel movies
04-10-2019T04:41:11,SpazztasticKiwi,give me my Loki back
04-10-2019T04:41:23,SageSaga,hes coming back
04-10-2019T04:41:33,SageSaga,hes got his own series
04-10-2019T04:41:47,JeremySenpai,Oh it's a VR thing
04-10-2019T04:41:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I will be a puddle of tears if he finally does
04-10-2019T04:42:08,SpazztasticKiwi,the series is based on a different dimension
04-10-2019T04:42:21,SpazztasticKiwi,he’s still killed off in the real dimension
04-10-2019T04:42:28,SpazztasticKiwi,unacceptable
04-10-2019T04:42:37,JeremySenpai,Loki re stole the Tesseract in endgame
04-10-2019T04:42:55,SageSaga,yeah but remember nothing changes if you mess with the past
04-10-2019T04:43:27,JeremySenpai,Oh they wen't with that time rule
04-10-2019T04:43:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I wonder if they realize they still have some holes with that time travel thing even if they fixed stuff
04-10-2019T04:43:56,SageSaga,they covered just about everything important
04-10-2019T04:44:15,SpazztasticKiwi,like with the main point - Loki taking the tessaract
04-10-2019T04:44:32,SpazztasticKiwi,how is he now arrested and taken home
04-10-2019T04:44:45,SpazztasticKiwi,cause they used that to teleport him and Thor home
04-10-2019T04:44:47,SageSaga,that happened in an alternate time line
04-10-2019T04:45:05,SageSaga,it affects nothing in the current timeline
04-10-2019T04:45:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Loki back
04-10-2019T04:45:26,SpazztasticKiwi,And alive
04-10-2019T04:45:32,SpazztasticKiwi,all I care about so far
04-10-2019T04:45:58,SageSaga,not in the main time line - but being a god he can probably re-enter the main time line somehow
04-10-2019T04:46:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I wish they’d pursued his myth a little more
04-10-2019T04:46:18,ZRO4825,Puny god. :3
04-10-2019T04:46:52,SpazztasticKiwi,introduce the goddess of fidelity
04-10-2019T04:46:55,SpazztasticKiwi,his wife
04-10-2019T04:47:01,SageSaga,i dunno - it would be weird to show him having sex with a horse and having a horse baby
04-10-2019T04:47:13,Kagiyama89,<3 beautiful..
04-10-2019T04:47:39,SpazztasticKiwi,"obviously they’d tweak that like the did his supposed wolf son, Fernir"
04-10-2019T04:47:52,sunblaze,having sex with a stallion but yes
04-10-2019T04:48:08,SageSaga,I didnt say he had sex with a mare...
04-10-2019T04:48:09,sunblaze,loki is not exactly known for being chosy with his partners
04-10-2019T04:48:26,SpazztasticKiwi,he’s also not known for being a he all the time
04-10-2019T04:48:29,SpazztasticKiwi,or human
04-10-2019T04:48:50,sunblaze,true
04-10-2019T04:48:53,SageSaga,i still love that story Thor told
04-10-2019T04:49:18,SageSaga,"""This one time my brother turned into a snake- and i picked him up because I love snakes- and then he turned back and stabbed me"""
04-10-2019T04:49:26,SpazztasticKiwi,they cut a scene where Loki tricks someone with a wine cup full of snakes
04-10-2019T04:49:40,yujinho,I have to go now...
04-10-2019T04:49:46,sunblaze,^ciao
04-10-2019T04:49:47,yujinho,Thank you guys for streaming~ <3
04-10-2019T04:49:54,EunhaGrey,nini yuyu
04-10-2019T04:49:56,SageSaga,take care
04-10-2019T04:49:57,yujinho,:ptv-hearts: Always nice to see you~
04-10-2019T04:50:16,SpazztasticKiwi,everyone that hears that story is just “wat da feck”
04-10-2019T04:50:49,SpazztasticKiwi,“and he’s your brother? you’re b r o t h e r s? And you still hang around him???”
04-10-2019T04:51:09,JeremySenpai,Later Jwi----- Yujin
04-10-2019T04:51:13,SpazztasticKiwi,the smug lil shite tho
04-10-2019T04:51:17,sunblaze,its Loki he means well
04-10-2019T04:51:19,SpazztasticKiwi,love him
04-10-2019T04:51:19,sunblaze,somehow...
04-10-2019T04:51:50,SpazztasticKiwi,"with his upbringing, can you blame him for being a little socially off"
04-10-2019T04:52:28,SpazztasticKiwi,I need a chance at SDCC
04-10-2019T04:52:32,sunblaze,no but we can blame him for keeing that way after he learns alternatives
04-10-2019T04:52:45,SpazztasticKiwi,see Tom Hiddleston
04-10-2019T04:53:57,SpazztasticKiwi,he keeps up the act cause it’s the only ways he’s been taught he gets the time of day from anyone
04-10-2019T04:54:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"and judging by his lifespan, he’s about 1,500 years and some change"
04-10-2019T04:54:48,Kagiyama89,god... eunha pls stab me <3
04-10-2019T04:54:59,SpazztasticKiwi,"based on the fact his full span is 5,000 give or take years, Loki is a teenager"
04-10-2019T04:55:20,SpazztasticKiwi,ish
04-10-2019T04:56:03,SpazztasticKiwi,I wish they’d explored more of Thor and Loki’s growing up
04-10-2019T04:56:09,SageSaga,Sunblaze- what kinda outfit did ya want for Mihari's elf? Halloween or just a normal outfit?
04-10-2019T04:56:24,EunhaGrey,eh? why happen kagi
04-10-2019T04:57:33,sunblaze,halloween one. but it seems she might give you some ideas about it :D
04-10-2019T04:57:54,SpazztasticKiwi,"at least have mercy on Thor and give him his brother back - dude lost his mom, dad, war buddies, best friend, hammer, home, then Loki"
04-10-2019T04:58:02,Kagiyama89,"no she's just the perfect 'I'd stab you but I'm too tired' girl, eun lol"
04-10-2019T04:58:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"“too far away, say - could you do me a favor and run into my blade for me?”"
04-10-2019T04:59:41,Kyorukun,pushes in a crateful of chicken nuggies and stops next to Eun's desk

04-10-2019T05:00:44,Kyorukun,of a masive ass pool
04-10-2019T05:00:50,Kagiyama89,hehe
04-10-2019T05:00:56,Kyorukun,"It's Picarto logic, Kiwi"

04-10-2019T07:31:08,TeapotOfDoom,whatcha countin 98? days since last laura?
04-10-2019T07:33:03,WINDOWS98SE,Yeah.
04-10-2019T07:33:23,TeapotOfDoom,140? that's what i call dedication ^^
04-10-2019T07:35:08,WINDOWS98SE,Only started counting around 120 though.  That's when she broke the record for longest time between posts.
04-10-2019T08:12:11,TeapotOfDoom,we have to stop this
04-10-2019T08:12:20,TeapotOfDoom,jk i dunno tbh
04-10-2019T08:13:02,TeapotOfDoom,since her character is oficially absent from the comic now it makes sense that people are requesting her less
04-10-2019T08:27:28,WINDOWS98SE,"I get that she's drawn less than some other characters, but since the new vote, she's suffered the most out of the top 24 characters (from Natani to Karen)."

04-10-2019T11:04:59,AspiringNoodle,How is everyone so far today?
04-10-2019T11:07:34,Ordithus,"Relaxed.  Had breakfast, have coffee, and it is raining"
04-10-2019T11:07:48,Ordithus,Might do some work on the car later
04-10-2019T11:08:16,CrRAR,"Yeah, I gotta do an oil change before the crappy weather starts."
04-10-2019T11:08:52,CrRAR,"Maybe coolant, but that’s not too urgent."
04-10-2019T11:09:00,AspiringNoodle,I'm due for an oil change in ~600 miles
04-10-2019T11:09:10,AspiringNoodle,"As well as the 100,000 mile maintenance :D"
04-10-2019T11:09:27,Ordithus,"I should check how my coolant is doing, I think it has been a while..."
04-10-2019T11:10:18,CrRAR,I go a little maintenance crazy by the book it’s every 40 or 50000 miles.
04-10-2019T11:10:48,CrRAR,Some ppl never touch it though.
04-10-2019T11:10:53,Ordithus,And get the snowblower ready for winter
04-10-2019T11:11:59,Ordithus,:cw0lfmare-Saltyember: I hate salt

04-10-2019T11:14:13,AspiringNoodle,"Note to self: when have enough money, sub to w0lf"
04-10-2019T11:14:20,AspiringNoodle,w0lf has best emotes xD
04-10-2019T11:14:28,CrRAR,Rust is just an automobile’s 5 o’clock shadow.
04-10-2019T11:14:51,AspiringNoodle,My dad finally got his 2001 F150 checked out in depth
04-10-2019T11:15:14,AspiringNoodle,"The rails holding the bed to the frame were almost nonexistant.  It's a good thing he hasn't hauled anything in years, probably would've ripped the bed off"
04-10-2019T11:15:24,CrRAR,Wow
04-10-2019T11:15:34,AspiringNoodle,Eeyup

04-10-2019T11:15:54,CrRAR,Yeah I heard folks with 2005’s having to replace their frames by now.
04-10-2019T11:16:04,Ordithus,My 11 Focus is starting to rust the rocker panels.  Like every single other Focus I see
04-10-2019T11:16:15,AspiringNoodle,I have a '14 Focus :D
04-10-2019T11:16:17,CrRAR,The Leif springs tend to start giving out.
04-10-2019T11:16:29,AspiringNoodle,I'm hoping to have enough money to get it detailed while it's still warm enough out for waxing
04-10-2019T11:16:38,CrRAR,Nice
04-10-2019T11:17:04,Ordithus,Hopefully Ford figured something out for yours
04-10-2019T11:17:04,AspiringNoodle,I had to rebuild my savings after letting loans eat it for a bit ._.

04-10-2019T11:20:28,AspiringNoodle,"At which point, I just need to make sure I have the money for my next loan payment, as well as insurance payments for the first 4 months c:"
04-10-2019T11:21:28,AspiringNoodle,"After that, it's money for the oil change / maintenance, detailing, and maaaaaaaaaybe new tires"
04-10-2019T11:21:36,AspiringNoodle,...my wallet :ptv-whiny:
04-10-2019T11:21:47,Ordithus,life is expensive
04-10-2019T11:22:09,AspiringNoodle,"Correction, life is cheap, QUALITY is expensive xD"
04-10-2019T11:28:07,CrRAR,>Buy van
04-10-2019T11:28:13,CrRAR,>Live down by river
04-10-2019T11:28:43,Ordithus,>Give advice to teenagers
04-10-2019T11:29:03,Ordithus,So they don't have to live in a VAN down by the RIVER
04-10-2019T11:29:20,CrRAR,"You know even the van dweller lifestyle is expensive, I checked. xD"
04-10-2019T11:29:29,Sclimshady,Van by the river is best
04-10-2019T11:29:41,CrRAR,One of those nice travel/camper vans is like 50-$60000
04-10-2019T11:29:56,CrRAR,Can’t even BE a bum these days.
04-10-2019T11:30:35,CrRAR,Maybe I’ll just lace up the old picnic sack and hitch a ride on the nearest boxcar.
04-10-2019T11:30:36,Sclimshady,The one I would want is 250000
04-10-2019T11:30:45,CrRAR,Hahaha
04-10-2019T11:30:51,Ordithus,That's a lot more than my house
04-10-2019T11:31:39,Sclimshady,"Im in cali,  a cheap house is 500000"
04-10-2019T11:31:46,CrRAR,"One guy arond the corner from here has one of those full bus-style RV’s... it disappears one week out of the year, the rest of the time it’s in his driveway."
04-10-2019T11:32:51,Ordithus,"He should rent that instead, or rent it out"
04-10-2019T11:33:12,CrRAR,>rent house

04-10-2019T11:37:13,CrRAR,I like the strategery
04-10-2019T11:39:21,AspiringNoodle,"Jesus, I go to start making a sandwich, and I come back to a thread on RV ownership, lol"
04-10-2019T11:41:05,CrRAR,That sandwich would be better in an RV with a view of the Grand Canyon.
04-10-2019T11:41:22,Sclimshady,"If you never even live in your house, they are a good investment"
04-10-2019T11:41:22,CrRAR,THINK about it
04-10-2019T11:42:06,Sclimshady,My job would give me almost 100 dollars more a day if I had one.  As I am now I have to use their hotels
04-10-2019T11:42:46,CrRAR,That’s a cool benefit. If you so happen to have mobile accommodations.
04-10-2019T11:43:18,CrRAR,*Schilm buys 2004 PT Cruiser*
04-10-2019T11:43:33,CrRAR,“...It’s TECHNICALLY a van”

04-10-2019T11:44:24,CrRAR,"Haha, that at least has classiq style."
04-10-2019T11:44:33,Sclimshady,My old boss had one with 4wd and it was awesome.  He was super racist though
04-10-2019T11:44:48,CrRAR,Wow
04-10-2019T11:45:23,CrRAR,Did he have a confedarte flag emblazoned on the side?
04-10-2019T11:45:41,CrRAR,That’s what I’m imagining xD
04-10-2019T11:46:19,Sclimshady,"Nah,  a bunch of anti immigration stickers and he kept saying messed up stuff about our mexican coworkers"
04-10-2019T11:46:43,CrRAR,awww
04-10-2019T11:47:41,Ordithus,... sounds like a pleasant human being (not)
04-10-2019T11:48:36,Sclimshady,Yeah...I like my new bosses way more.  plus I make 4 times more when Im not in school
04-10-2019T11:49:46,CrRAR,"Yeah, I understand the need to build skills in school, but it is such a huge distraction."
04-10-2019T11:50:42,Sclimshady,I only have one more semester then ill be pipe certified and I can go weld gas and oil lines. so its well worth it
04-10-2019T11:51:26,CrRAR,Yeah if you can get real world certs along with it it’s super valuable.
04-10-2019T11:51:32,Ordithus,Remember to remove the flammable things before welding
04-10-2019T11:52:03,Sclimshady,"No,  imma weld on a sealed acetylene tank, you cant stop me"
04-10-2019T11:52:05,AspiringNoodle,Someone mentioned bosses c:
04-10-2019T11:52:16,Sclimshady,like a boss
04-10-2019T11:52:39,AspiringNoodle,"Who do you think will last longer?  My manager, or me? xD"

04-10-2019T11:53:08,CrRAR,Uhh
04-10-2019T11:53:12,Sclimshady,"Depends,  who will your ujpper management believe?"
04-10-2019T11:53:22,AspiringNoodle,"The customers, lmao"
04-10-2019T11:53:33,CrRAR,"My boss quit on his own, so there’s hope yet noodle!"
04-10-2019T11:53:47,AspiringNoodle,One problem we're having at the station is stock
04-10-2019T11:53:58,Sclimshady,You ran out of cows?
04-10-2019T11:54:01,AspiringNoodle,"Too much of shit that doesn't sell (too much inventory in general, tbh)"
04-10-2019T11:54:14,AspiringNoodle,And not enough of the stuff that DOES sell (mainly cigarettes)
04-10-2019T11:54:48,AspiringNoodle,"On top of that, I've been hearing very concerning things about his behavior in the morning"
04-10-2019T11:55:07,CrRAR,Sounds like it’s time to rejigger the current business model!
04-10-2019T11:55:08,Sclimshady,"Oof,  In blue collar towns, smokes are restocked like 3 times a day"
04-10-2019T11:55:30,CrRAR,"To the boardroom, batman!"
04-10-2019T11:55:32,AspiringNoodle,"The worst I've personally received is negative feedback / constructive criticism that's a bit heavy on the ""needs work"" part"
04-10-2019T11:55:40,AspiringNoodle,But what I'm hearing concerns me
04-10-2019T11:56:44,CrRAR,"Yeah, when the suggestions you get have no basis in reality it gets tough.."
04-10-2019T11:57:06,AspiringNoodle,"I get really irritated when I go to restock the cigarettes, and we've been out of stuff / low on stuff for days"
04-10-2019T11:57:26,AspiringNoodle,"And then when we get one of two weekly shipments, and that stuff doesn't get restocked, I literally go ""what the fuck?"""
04-10-2019T11:58:33,AspiringNoodle,"*sigh*, maybe my 2nd job will give me more hours and I won't have to deal with this stuff anymore ;_;"
04-10-2019T11:59:56,AspiringNoodle,Anyone got management / boss horror stories to share? :3
04-10-2019T12:00:01,CrRAR,"Often managers lose sight of what it actually takes to run things because they forget what it actually takes to do your job well, so when they make stupid suggestions it’s best to just adjust accoringly the best way you know to resolve the issue."
04-10-2019T12:00:31,CrRAR,Even if it isn’t exactly what they’re asking for.
04-10-2019T12:00:37,Sclimshady,My old old boss tried to call my local PD and tell them I was a troublemaker and to keep an eye on me
04-10-2019T12:00:45,AspiringNoodle,....wut
04-10-2019T12:00:54,CrRAR,You got to stand up for what you believe.
04-10-2019T12:01:08,Sclimshady,"He didnt know My grandpa worked for them for 40 years, I knew most of them, and they all like me"
04-10-2019T12:01:15,AspiringNoodle,xD
04-10-2019T12:01:19,CrRAR,"If they don’t see sense, then time to ship off."
04-10-2019T12:01:35,AspiringNoodle,We'll see if we actually get new employees
04-10-2019T12:01:37,CrRAR,Wow schilm lol
04-10-2019T12:01:44,Sclimshady,"Also, I only pissed him off by trying to do my job"
04-10-2019T12:02:03,AspiringNoodle,"He's been manager for going on 3 months now, and we're still short staffed.  And what were you doing that pissed him off?"
04-10-2019T12:02:16,AspiringNoodle,"Because, holy-"
04-10-2019T12:02:34,Sclimshady,"I was the senior medic and he was explosion fodder,  I told him to piss off when I was treating a patient"
04-10-2019T12:03:08,CrRAR,:ok_hand:
04-10-2019T12:03:22,Sclimshady,It kinda snowballed from there
04-10-2019T12:03:36,Sclimshady,I am very petty when I get pissed off
04-10-2019T12:03:58,Sclimshady,Which is luckily pretty rare
04-10-2019T12:04:10,CrRAR,Sometimes managers get threatened by subordinates who actually know how to do their jobs right. xD
04-10-2019T12:04:14,AspiringNoodle,"Wait wait wait, so you were treating a patient"
04-10-2019T12:04:21,AspiringNoodle,And he was being a dumbass?
04-10-2019T12:04:35,AspiringNoodle,"Like, cause a literal explosion dumbass?"
04-10-2019T12:05:00,Sclimshady,"He tried to send him back out the day after he was blown up,  I told him to shove it somewhere not nice"
04-10-2019T12:05:57,Sclimshady,The dude had a messed up knee and could barely stay conscious cause of his concussion
04-10-2019T12:06:14,AspiringNoodle,You were indeed in the right to tell him to piss off
04-10-2019T12:06:26,AspiringNoodle,How long did he last? xD
04-10-2019T12:06:44,Sclimshady,"He's still there, I left after my contract"
04-10-2019T12:07:09,AspiringNoodle,Why am I not surprised
04-10-2019T12:07:21,AspiringNoodle,Dumbass who's so bad at his job he could get someone killed
04-10-2019T12:07:28,AspiringNoodle,Yet still maintains a position of authority :/
04-10-2019T12:07:42,CrRAR,"Honestly the folks I’ve respected most were folks that didn’t care if they walked out, “aka, well if that’s the way it is, I’ll quit” tbh that’s really the best way to communicate to upper management, sadly."
04-10-2019T12:08:20,AspiringNoodle,Probably explains why a seasoned employee quit a month ago
04-10-2019T12:08:30,Sclimshady,"He was so smug that I would be living on the street, jokes on him,  im doing way better than before"
04-10-2019T12:08:30,AspiringNoodle,"19 yo, very bright, been there a whole year"
04-10-2019T12:08:48,CrRAR,"Eventually they’ll solve the problem, but cost-cutters who don’t really care about quality end up getting the glory."
04-10-2019T12:08:56,AspiringNoodle,"Oh yeah, no"
04-10-2019T12:09:05,AspiringNoodle,Finance / marketing only care about their precious numbers
04-10-2019T12:09:18,Sclimshady,My precioussssss
04-10-2019T12:09:18,AspiringNoodle,"They can't at all comprehend ephemeral things like ""quality"""

04-10-2019T12:09:32,AspiringNoodle,"And ""customer satisfaction"" :)"
04-10-2019T12:09:39,Sclimshady,"Which is why they lose customers ""unexpectedly"""

04-10-2019T12:10:17,CrRAR,"Like, we’re here to run a quality department, how are we doing our jobs right if everything sucks?"
04-10-2019T12:10:23,Sclimshady,I would watch that show
04-10-2019T12:10:30,HoverdudeXL,hey CrRAR
04-10-2019T12:10:38,AspiringNoodle,"Gordon Ramsey is halfway there, lol"

04-10-2019T12:10:52,CrRAR,Hello hover!
04-10-2019T12:11:06,AspiringNoodle,"Hi hover, hope you'd had a ""weh"" day today :3"
04-10-2019T12:11:08,Sclimshady,"Ever seen angrycops?  hes a drill sgt who rants about stuff in the yell,  its gold"
04-10-2019T12:11:15,HoverdudeXL,nop
04-10-2019T12:11:55,AspiringNoodle,Can't wait for next week
04-10-2019T12:12:13,Sclimshady,Whats next week
04-10-2019T12:12:16,AspiringNoodle,"Once I finally have some damned days off, gonna look for health insurance and compare it against the company's offerings :3"
04-10-2019T12:12:38,AspiringNoodle,I do NOT feel like being tied to a company for health insurance if I can't help it
04-10-2019T12:13:23,AspiringNoodle,"I have 2 jobs, one is part time for an app that's a businessman's personal project, and the other is at a gas station"
04-10-2019T12:14:01,AspiringNoodle,"Both pay roughly $10 an hour, but guess which one let's me sit on my ass at home and listen to music the entire time, with more narrowed tasks"
04-10-2019T12:14:16,AspiringNoodle,"And the other has me standing for 7 - 8 hours straight, deal with customers, and try to do all the things xD"
04-10-2019T12:14:33,Sclimshady,Sitting sounds better that customer service
04-10-2019T12:14:46,AspiringNoodle,"Oh, believe it or not, I like the customer service aspect :3"
04-10-2019T12:14:51,AspiringNoodle,I'm absolutely BEAMING
04-10-2019T12:15:08,Sclimshady,Wierd
04-10-2019T12:15:10,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-power:
04-10-2019T12:15:13,AspiringNoodle,It's just trying to do everything else while having to serve customers within 30 seconds of them approaching the checkout line
04-10-2019T12:15:41,AspiringNoodle,"But in reality, it's more like 10 seconds, because if they're standing there, and you're trying to do a task real quick that you started before they got there"
04-10-2019T12:15:51,CrRAR,Solution: roller blades
04-10-2019T12:15:57,AspiringNoodle,"A coworker / person above you will be like, ""hey, why aren't they being served?"""
04-10-2019T12:16:00,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
04-10-2019T12:16:28,AspiringNoodle,"So, I have 2 options: stand behind the counter most of the time while customers are in the store"
04-10-2019T12:16:33,Sclimshady,Roller blades and a tight skirt
04-10-2019T12:16:41,CrRAR,“Because I’m over HERE right now”
04-10-2019T12:16:46,AspiringNoodle,"Or try to go out and get stuff done, but only get like 10 seconds of progress before serving customers for 10+ minutes"
04-10-2019T12:16:55,CrRAR,“Physicaly impossible
04-10-2019T12:17:01,AspiringNoodle,"And either way, you won't get praise, only criticism"
04-10-2019T12:17:22,CrRAR,...and no good deed goes unpunished.
04-10-2019T12:18:25,AspiringNoodle,I tend to stay behind the counter more than I should
04-10-2019T12:18:43,AspiringNoodle,"Mostly because it feels like when I DO try to leave, the customer who is walking up to the store goes straight for the counter"
04-10-2019T12:18:54,AspiringNoodle,Or the customer whose been in the store for a few minutes FINALLY heads to the front
04-10-2019T12:19:13,AspiringNoodle,Customer programming:
04-10-2019T12:19:42,AspiringNoodle,"If clerkAtCounter == 'true"" approach counter"
04-10-2019T12:20:37,Sclimshady,I try to be really understanding about that.  I also go to the same station every morning so I've seen the same lady for the last 6 months
04-10-2019T12:20:54,AspiringNoodle,I messed up my joke :c
04-10-2019T12:21:07,Sclimshady,Program error

04-10-2019T12:22:17,AspiringNoodle,else approach counter
04-10-2019T12:23:01,AspiringNoodle,"To give you an idea of how busy it can be when I'm one of two people on shift, and the other person is completing tasks around the store"
04-10-2019T12:23:45,AspiringNoodle,"Last night, there was a 2 - 3 hour stretch where customers were streaming in constantly, and the most I could get done was fetch a carton of cigs from the back and maybe stock 2 boxes before a customer comes up"
04-10-2019T12:24:12,AspiringNoodle,"But enough of my ranting, you guys rant"
04-10-2019T12:24:17,AspiringNoodle,I don't want to hog the chat ._.
04-10-2019T12:24:50,Sclimshady,"You good, Im distracted by Purps stream"
04-10-2019T12:26:42,CrRAR,Haha
04-10-2019T12:27:22,AspiringNoodle,"Btw, can't wait for the remodel (if I even stick around that long), our coffee setup is moronic"
04-10-2019T12:30:16,AspiringNoodle,"rar, do heelys count?"
04-10-2019T12:30:23,AspiringNoodle,"For roller blades, I mean"
04-10-2019T12:30:55,Sclimshady,Heelys count double
04-10-2019T12:31:03,Sclimshady,way sexier
04-10-2019T13:00:28,CrRAR,Lol yes they do
04-10-2019T13:01:18,CrRAR,"Also accetable: Segways, hoverboards, and onewheelers"
04-10-2019T13:01:42,CrRAR,*acceptable
04-10-2019T13:03:52,CrRAR,They should work out those refuelers like tesla is where the “hose” finds the car.
04-10-2019T13:04:56,Sclimshady,"Nope,  not playing with electrical snake tech"
04-10-2019T13:05:21,CrRAR,xD

04-10-2019T15:12:45,SageSaga,i should probably use this time to go to the store and get some food

04-10-2019T22:47:26,Ordithus,I don't think cats can taste sweet
04-10-2019T22:47:36,Ordithus,"Also cake isn't meat, or grass"

04-10-2019T23:15:41,SpazztasticKiwi,like the demon murderer is gonna be like “oh ok then I’ll leave”
04-10-2019T23:16:07,Sclimshady,If they were raised with manners they will
04-10-2019T23:20:09,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s weird cause sometimes Mark says “no thank you I don’t want any”
04-10-2019T23:20:46,SpazztasticKiwi,"dude knows that you’re not obligated to be polite to the creature trying to chew your knees off, right?"
