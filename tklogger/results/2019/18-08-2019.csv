18-08-2019T14:03:00,TerraTheWizard,it's apprentice hr something
18-08-2019T14:03:15,FreedomCrusader,that sounds like something I was tolda  couple days ago
18-08-2019T14:03:17,TeapotOfDoom,apprentice hr assistant manager assistant
18-08-2019T14:03:24,Sclimshady,"Oh boy,  that will probably be a rough interview."
18-08-2019T14:03:45,AspiringNoodle,I was planning to test my mobo first
18-08-2019T14:03:55,AspiringNoodle,"But I'd basically have to assemble most of the things first, lol"
18-08-2019T14:04:14,TeapotOfDoom,maybe test build it outside the case?
18-08-2019T14:04:21,TerraTheWizard,interviews for apprenticeships seem to be the least rough most not-serious ones i've had to do
18-08-2019T14:04:30,TerraTheWizard,it's like a chat but i need to wear a suit
18-08-2019T14:04:31,TerraTheWizard,lol
18-08-2019T14:04:42,AspiringNoodle,"So, it's like I thought"
18-08-2019T14:04:52,AspiringNoodle,"To test that most things work, I'd basically have to assemble everything"
18-08-2019T14:04:55,Sclimshady,I just guessed Interviewing to be an interviewer would be kinda hard
18-08-2019T14:05:01,TeapotOfDoom,yes noodle
18-08-2019T14:05:25,AspiringNoodle,"Ofc, I'm just being super extra cautious at this point :P"
18-08-2019T14:05:42,TeapotOfDoom,you are interviewed about interviewing and reviewing reviews
18-08-2019T14:05:55,TeapotOfDoom,sry can't be serious tonight
18-08-2019T14:06:07,Sclimshady,Rub your feet on carpet and touch your Mobo without a ground
18-08-2019T14:06:10,TeapotOfDoom,ordering pizza

18-08-2019T14:06:48,TeapotOfDoom,tastes like chips
18-08-2019T14:06:55,AspiringNoodle,RAM + CPU should be installed before mounting a MOBO anyways
18-08-2019T14:06:55,TeapotOfDoom,like dram chips
18-08-2019T14:07:09,CrimsonQuill,I showed my sister the Twokinds Bingo page

18-08-2019T14:08:19,CrimsonQuill,And I have a few squares marked
18-08-2019T14:08:43,Sclimshady,You should also be able to add new squares or make a new bingo card on that site
18-08-2019T14:09:07,Sclimshady,You can even add custom square markers

18-08-2019T14:14:20,FreedomCrusader,that was apparently a long stream
18-08-2019T14:14:30,CrimsonQuill,"Well, that's another square marked on the Bingo chart."

18-08-2019T14:15:22,FreedomCrusader,Cause I was about to go to bed anyway
18-08-2019T14:16:47,CrimsonQuill,I left after the second Poll.
18-08-2019T14:17:59,CrimsonQuill,Tired plus early start in morning.
18-08-2019T14:23:41,TeapotOfDoom,is there an option to create more different cards?
18-08-2019T14:23:53,TeapotOfDoom,otherwise it will always be the same one for everybody
18-08-2019T14:24:18,CrimsonQuill,I think it says 'edit'
18-08-2019T14:27:03,Sclimshady,You create squares and it will randomize them

18-08-2019T14:40:35,Sclimshady,What is that?
18-08-2019T14:40:42,TeapotOfDoom,It has pretty much everything you could imagine on it
18-08-2019T14:40:50,TeapotOfDoom,Bauer = peasant
18-08-2019T14:40:54,TeapotOfDoom,or farmer
18-08-2019T14:41:00,TeapotOfDoom,more like farmer
18-08-2019T14:41:00,Sclimshady,There better not be pineapple
18-08-2019T14:41:11,TeapotOfDoom,Why tho? I like pineapple
18-08-2019T14:41:16,TeapotOfDoom,but there is not
18-08-2019T14:41:28,Sclimshady,It does.'t belong on pizza
18-08-2019T14:41:45,TeapotOfDoom,oh heck yeah it does
18-08-2019T14:41:50,TeapotOfDoom,fite me
18-08-2019T14:42:00,Sclimshady,That is heresy
18-08-2019T14:42:31,Mikemkke034,"Pineapple is good on pizza, but only with ham or banana peppers :yum:"
18-08-2019T14:43:27,Sclimshady,This is only getting worse
18-08-2019T14:45:06,Mikemkke034,Lol
18-08-2019T14:45:43,Mikemkke034,I'm neutral about pizza. I work in the business of it
18-08-2019T14:49:03,TeapotOfDoom,What the heck?

18-08-2019T14:53:19,TeapotOfDoom,i agree with the ham part
18-08-2019T14:53:47,Sclimshady,Banana peppers are actually really good on pizza
18-08-2019T14:53:50,AspiringNoodle,"Mmmm, computer so sexy right now"
18-08-2019T14:54:11,Sclimshady,Really mild spice and a savory flavor
18-08-2019T14:54:12,AspiringNoodle,"Still putting things into the mobo, but now the CPU / RAM are installed.  I give props to AMD, I like their pin system better <3"

18-08-2019T15:43:32,SpazztasticKiwi,old lady comes to the case
18-08-2019T15:43:46,SpazztasticKiwi,she’s thinking so I tell her I’ll help her when she’s ready
18-08-2019T15:44:15,SpazztasticKiwi,my manager then walks by and sees her - goes up to help as I’m turning back to her
18-08-2019T15:44:44,SpazztasticKiwi,but the old lady points at me and says - “oh no she was gonna get me”
18-08-2019T15:44:57,SpazztasticKiwi,the only difference between me and my manager is I am white
18-08-2019T15:45:03,SpazztasticKiwi,sooooooo

18-08-2019T15:46:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I want to believe maybe she didn’t mean it that way and it was just that I’d said I’d get her when she was ready but oh boy
18-08-2019T15:47:58,CrimsonQuill,Hiya Spazztastic
18-08-2019T15:48:08,SpazztasticKiwi,"a second later I’m over at the other counter where the other manager is, and she’s heard the first manager tell her what happened"
18-08-2019T15:49:00,SpazztasticKiwi,all I could hear from her as she made the garlic bread was a muttered “stupid redneck inbred old fashioned morons...”

18-08-2019T17:16:08,AspiringNoodle,No idea if the trace is bad now
18-08-2019T17:16:35,IronHorseComics,well just give it a Flora and it'll be good again

18-08-2019T18:12:41,SpazztasticKiwi,how concerning is it that I’ve taken a knack to making up horror creatures
18-08-2019T18:17:13,IronHorseComics,on a scale of 1 to 10? ... 6
18-08-2019T18:34:53,CrRAR,Do you imagine these horror creatures attacking unsuspecting bystanders?
18-08-2019T18:57:03,IronHorseComics,the silence is rather concerning
18-08-2019T18:57:45,Sclimshady,The monsters have gotten everyone.  None remain
18-08-2019T19:00:59,CrRAR,They continue on to create their own wholesome society.
18-08-2019T19:01:05,CrRAR,Then one day new horrors come for them.

18-08-2019T19:12:27,RimaDraws,i got my school books today
18-08-2019T19:13:32,Sclimshady,I am just not gonna buy mine.  I dont want to spend 600 dollars on books ill use for a few months.  Plus our homework is through the school website
18-08-2019T19:13:52,RimaDraws,mine are included in my tuition
18-08-2019T19:14:17,RimaDraws,like all i gotta pay back when i get done in a couple years is $3351 out of 16$k
18-08-2019T19:14:26,RimaDraws,i got it made with my scholarships
18-08-2019T19:15:07,Sclimshady,"My scholarship gives me money for books,  but I dont actually need them so I'"
18-08-2019T19:15:16,Sclimshady,I'm gonna keep it
18-08-2019T19:15:57,RimaDraws,this university i am going to they ship my books to me because i am taking the program at motlow where i graduated . i got really lucky
18-08-2019T19:17:22,RimaDraws,and these are small regular reading books then again my classes only last like 6 weeks each
18-08-2019T19:17:39,Sclimshady,"Thats pretty nice,  I have to leave work to get to the store before it closes so I don't even have an Id yet"
18-08-2019T19:20:52,RimaDraws,i am nervous about this next step in my life
18-08-2019T19:23:34,Sclimshady,Being nervous means you care about the outcome and helps you work harder.
18-08-2019T19:24:26,RimaDraws,i know but this is huge for me. being an adult working and going back to school is something i never thought id achieve
18-08-2019T19:24:44,RimaDraws,but i am glad to have good friends to support me ^^
18-08-2019T19:27:31,Sclimshady,"It does fell really weird to be an ""adult"".   I still have no clue what i'm doing.  Kinda just hoping for the best"
18-08-2019T19:28:05,RimaDraws,believe me took a while to know what i wanted
18-08-2019T19:30:19,Sclimshady,I know that feel.  I have gone through 3 Majors and 2 careers already
18-08-2019T19:30:30,RimaDraws,damn
18-08-2019T19:30:43,RimaDraws,i went through.....three majors before i decided what i wanted
18-08-2019T19:32:00,Sclimshady,I still don't know if I want to do oilfield work or custom fabrication and move into owning a company
18-08-2019T19:35:51,RimaDraws,well i would do research then decide from there. owning a company is alot and you might want to look into the pros and cons on it
18-08-2019T19:40:02,Sclimshady,"I'll need to get experience doing fab before I can get into the oilfield so I'll be able to weigh it as I go,  and even just working fab for someone else pays really well."
18-08-2019T19:40:24,CrRAR,Yeah that's good money.
18-08-2019T19:41:13,CrRAR,"But yeah, as long as you keep working toward something you have a decent talent at you'll do well. You always hear the stories of folks that ""I don't LOVE my job... but I'm good at it."" even better if you can love it and be good at it."
18-08-2019T19:41:33,RimaDraws,i didnt choose art because i already do it in my spare time
18-08-2019T19:41:35,RimaDraws,and make money on it
18-08-2019T19:42:22,CrRAR,yeah!
18-08-2019T19:42:35,CrRAR,Conversely there the folks that try to force being good at something just because they're convinced they like it.
18-08-2019T19:42:46,CrRAR,Let your talents guide you~

18-08-2019T19:45:20,Sclimshady,I would have to be working towards nursing or something if I did that
18-08-2019T19:45:58,IronHorseComics,seriously?
18-08-2019T19:46:17,Sclimshady,"Yeah, 12 dollars an hour"
18-08-2019T19:46:29,IronHorseComics,you'd think you'd get paid more
18-08-2019T19:47:25,Sclimshady,"Paramedics can make 70,000 salaries but school is not cheap and this is one of the best paid services in the US"
18-08-2019T19:48:03,Sclimshady,Most Paramedics make 15-18 hr
18-08-2019T19:48:27,RimaDraws,oooooh

18-08-2019T19:48:41,CrRAR,(in the ambulance)
18-08-2019T19:49:34,CrRAR,Yeah there's so many occupations that should make more money.
18-08-2019T19:49:44,Sclimshady,"Lol,  If my military certs translated I would be above paramedics but I only hold an EMT basic cert as a civiian"
18-08-2019T19:50:23,CrRAR,interesting
18-08-2019T19:51:17,Sclimshady,"Yeah, I've literally performed minor surgery, but bureaucracy"
18-08-2019T19:52:29,CrRAR,yeah
18-08-2019T19:53:26,Sclimshady,"I actually got to ""assist"" in a brain surgery once.  Although I mainly kept account of the instruments."
18-08-2019T19:55:11,CrRAR,Just because of how fast-paced the surgery was or...?
18-08-2019T19:55:37,IronHorseComics,"""I'm just here to slice someone's brain, nothing to see here"
18-08-2019T19:56:09,Sclimshady,"No, it was way above my skill but I knew the surgeons and they had me makes sure nothing was left inside afterwards"
18-08-2019T19:56:33,CrRAR,yeah they use lots of clips and things right?

18-08-2019T19:56:58,IronHorseComics,"no no no, they used a stapler until they ran out of staples and chose to use a glue stick"

18-08-2019T19:57:24,SpazztasticKiwi,that’s a level of preparation you wanna see in surgery
18-08-2019T19:58:06,CrRAR,I'm just laughing at the notion that it was an Elmers brand glue stick.
18-08-2019T19:58:18,CrRAR,Such a happy cow mascot. ;_;

18-08-2019T22:17:05,CrRAR,So coverage does matter to a degree.
18-08-2019T22:22:15,AspiringNoodle,I wish I had more room to build
18-08-2019T22:22:24,AspiringNoodle,Part of the reason it takes me so long is that I don't have a lot of room
18-08-2019T22:22:39,AspiringNoodle,So stuff gets piled on top of each other / i have to be careful moving stuff around
18-08-2019T22:22:48,AspiringNoodle,Complete death by a 1000 cuts

18-08-2019T22:29:18,AspiringNoodle,Or they get too close to an exhaust fan for my liking if I try to keep it in the cpu area

18-08-2019T23:41:23,AspiringNoodle,at least my computer's in the home stretch
18-08-2019T23:41:35,AspiringNoodle,Everything that can be has been inserted / screwed into place (where applicable)
18-08-2019T23:41:47,AspiringNoodle,Now it's literally all just cable management (FUCKING. JOY.)
