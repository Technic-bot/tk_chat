11-04-2019T21:42:59,Twokinds,Usually left but sometimes I alternate

11-04-2019T21:44:13,w0lfmare,Made it to :cw0lfmare-EmberTooHappy: on easy
11-04-2019T21:44:26,Nekonny,eveybody seems to be playing thta now
11-04-2019T21:44:31,Ordithus,I'm not
11-04-2019T21:44:39,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah I know lots of people on it
11-04-2019T21:45:38,Gundurr,it runs really well on linux
11-04-2019T21:45:42,146Time,I'm glad it blew up. I didn't realize so many people even knew it existed
11-04-2019T21:45:53,146Time,I thought RoR 1 was kind of a niche hit
11-04-2019T21:46:07,SageSaga,first time i ever played RoR2 i beat it
11-04-2019T21:46:31,Nekonny,"I know  ""of"" it"
11-04-2019T21:46:39,Nekonny,but I have no idea what it's about
11-04-2019T21:46:48,146Time,It's the BEST ROGUELIKE EVER
11-04-2019T21:47:04,Gundurr,"ok, you dont need to exxaggerate"
11-04-2019T21:47:13,Gundurr,im pretty sure its dwarf fortress
11-04-2019T21:47:14,146Time,"Well, *to me* anyway"
11-04-2019T21:47:22,146Time,okay DF is pretty great
11-04-2019T21:47:27,146Time,damn you invincible sponge riders
11-04-2019T21:47:58,Twokinds,I dunno if I'd even count dwarf fortress as a roguelike
11-04-2019T21:48:12,Twokinds,It's pretty much a mutant entity unto its own
11-04-2019T21:48:35,Mihari,Well the share item mod was a success and worked really well.
11-04-2019T21:48:53,SageSaga,So i can be a loot goblin again?
11-04-2019T21:49:07,Mihari,Yes
11-04-2019T21:49:11,SageSaga,yay!
11-04-2019T21:49:15,Nekonny,I should try out more games
11-04-2019T21:49:29,146Time,try out risk of rain 2 then
11-04-2019T21:49:32,CrRAR,The speciallist loot goblin that ever lived
11-04-2019T21:49:34,146Time,good deal for the content
11-04-2019T21:49:35,Twokinds,I really enjoyed Togue Legacy. I think that's one of my favorites.
11-04-2019T21:49:41,Twokinds,Rogue Legacy*
11-04-2019T21:49:53,146Time,"I didn't care for rogue legacy, the mechanic felt more annoying than rewarding"
11-04-2019T21:49:57,CrRAR,lol
11-04-2019T21:49:57,Nekonny,"Gonna grab a snack, leaving Kimi to take care of the stream in the meantime"
11-04-2019T21:50:02,Twokinds,I liked the sense of progression.
11-04-2019T21:50:05,146Time,RoR and Gungeon are much more my street
11-04-2019T21:50:09,Twokinds,I beat it.
11-04-2019T21:50:27,146Time,"I did too, but again, not my cup of tea"
11-04-2019T21:50:31,Ordithus,Have a good snack Ron
11-04-2019T21:50:41,unsteddyphoenix,man I need to play gungeon
11-04-2019T21:50:44,unsteddyphoenix,It looks so goood
11-04-2019T21:50:54,146Time,"now's the time, they did the last updatee"
11-04-2019T21:50:55,Twokinds,FTL
11-04-2019T21:51:00,unsteddyphoenix,Oooh
11-04-2019T21:51:01,Twokinds,Probably one of the best.
11-04-2019T21:51:08,Gundurr,Caves of Qud is pretty good
11-04-2019T21:51:10,146Time,"Oh, FTL is a good one, though Into the Breach ruins it for me XD"
11-04-2019T21:51:16,unsteddyphoenix,My smol brain couldnt handle it
11-04-2019T21:51:21,unsteddyphoenix,Into the Breach I like a lot
11-04-2019T21:51:30,146Time,It's so much more fair than FTL was
11-04-2019T21:51:35,Twokinds,I'm not sure if I liked Into the Breach
11-04-2019T21:52:07,146Time,"I really enjoyed the feeling of mastery it gave me, going from barely able to muddle through an island, to crushing a 4 island run with the stock team"
11-04-2019T21:52:21,Twokinds,"I played through one game, beat it, and then didn't really feel like going through again. Which is weird, I like puzzle-y games, but it felt too easy."
11-04-2019T21:52:35,Alphawolf333,FTL's is probably one of my top 3 rougelikes. loved the music
11-04-2019T21:52:43,unsteddyphoenix,Tfw IQ too high to enjoy game
11-04-2019T21:52:43,146Time,You gotta go for the challenges on Breach
11-04-2019T21:52:54,146Time,unlocking the teams and shooting for the gimmick builds
11-04-2019T21:52:56,CrRAR,lol
11-04-2019T21:53:03,146Time,I 100%d that game
11-04-2019T21:53:07,146Time,I loved it so much
11-04-2019T21:53:10,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah, learning how every team works is fun"
11-04-2019T21:53:15,unsteddyphoenix,Im still getting through it
11-04-2019T21:53:22,Gundurr,Dead cells is a good rogue like
11-04-2019T21:53:26,146Time,I adored the smokescreen team
11-04-2019T21:53:31,146Time,those guys were just busted
11-04-2019T21:53:34,unsteddyphoenix,Oh yeah
11-04-2019T21:53:40,unsteddyphoenix,Lightning smoke SO strong
11-04-2019T21:53:44,Twokinds,Dead Cells was good.
11-04-2019T21:54:02,146Time,"When I had to do ""use all 3 of the same mech"" I just loaded up on rocket artillery"
11-04-2019T21:54:03,Dadrobit,"Damn, came back from getting a snack to watch the stream, but I guess I gotta go play FTL again now..."
11-04-2019T21:54:08,Twokinds,"I played that for a good while. Only beat it once, stopped before going any further."
11-04-2019T21:54:24,146Time,I still need to beat dead cells and hollow knight
11-04-2019T21:54:30,Nekonny,"It's hard for me to get into games,"
11-04-2019T21:54:39,Nekonny,and when I do I overdo it
11-04-2019T21:54:47,Dadrobit,Big Same
11-04-2019T21:54:51,Ordithus,Saaaame
11-04-2019T21:54:58,Ordithus,Zelda BOTW did it for me
11-04-2019T21:55:00,Twokinds,HOLLOW KNIGHT!
11-04-2019T21:55:03,Twokinds,So good
11-04-2019T21:55:13,146Time,Need to beat it before silksong comes out
11-04-2019T21:55:17,146Time,otherwise RIP
11-04-2019T21:55:28,Twokinds,My favorite game of that year... if Zelda hadn't come out. But VERY close.
11-04-2019T21:55:37,Combak,I can't wait for Silksong!
11-04-2019T21:55:39,146Time,Also darkwood
11-04-2019T21:55:45,146Time,Need to finish darkwood badly
11-04-2019T21:55:50,Twokinds,Yeah can't wait.
11-04-2019T21:56:02,Nekonny,wonders when people have times for games
11-04-2019T21:56:04,Twokinds,I both loved and hated the final challanges.
11-04-2019T21:56:07,146Time,"As far as the *ethics* of gaming goes, Darkwood will live forever in my mind"
11-04-2019T21:56:22,Gundurr,people hsve time for gsmes when they arent drawing
11-04-2019T21:56:24,Twokinds,Darkwood... haven't played that one.
11-04-2019T21:56:43,146Time,It's an awesome top down survival horror with a heavy slavic mythology bent
11-04-2019T21:57:03,146Time,wonderful use of sound and limited perspective
11-04-2019T21:57:46,Gundurr,"couldnt get into it, 2spoopy2me"
11-04-2019T21:57:50,Twokinds,Yeah I've heard of it. I do want to give it a try.
11-04-2019T21:58:02,146Time,plus the devs are the coolest people on the planet
11-04-2019T21:58:19,Twokinds,Even though I'm not really into dark or grimey themes in games. Not really my bag.
11-04-2019T21:58:30,Twokinds,"Which is weird, since I love Hollow Knight XD"
11-04-2019T21:58:37,146Time,"They were so sad upon seeing messages from people who loved the game but had to refund it for money reasons, they *pirated their own game* so people who couldn't afford it could play it"
11-04-2019T21:58:57,Twokinds,But I guess there are always exceptions.
11-04-2019T21:59:39,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah if somethings good enough it overrides your own preferences
11-04-2019T21:59:39,SageSaga,one of the most interesting things you can learn from Norse Mythology is that Loki is a mother
11-04-2019T21:59:46,unsteddyphoenix,Or thats what ive always found
11-04-2019T22:00:07,MarvTheHugPharaoh,and the 6 legged horse was the father
11-04-2019T22:00:19,MarvTheHugPharaoh,and Loki gave birth to a snake
11-04-2019T22:00:20,SageSaga,no that was the child
11-04-2019T22:00:42,MarvTheHugPharaoh,you sure
11-04-2019T22:00:48,SageSaga,Loki's child was the horse- and his father Rides his grand child around
11-04-2019T22:01:11,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"welp, back to school for me"
11-04-2019T22:01:11,Gundurr,Loki gave birth to Jormungundr
11-04-2019T22:01:18,Gundurr,the world serpant
11-04-2019T22:01:38,Gundurr,also six legged horses
11-04-2019T22:01:51,Gundurr,Loki is wack
11-04-2019T22:02:26,SageSaga,Loki was the MOTHER to the Horse
11-04-2019T22:02:33,Ordithus,That moment when you realize Tom's stream has been paused for... a while.  Curse you picarto!!! :ctwokinds-floAAA:
11-04-2019T22:02:35,SageSaga,the others he was the father
11-04-2019T22:02:42,Gundurr,yeah
11-04-2019T22:03:02,Twokinds,Well I haven't made too much progress
11-04-2019T22:03:04,Twokinds,Too much game talk
11-04-2019T22:03:16,Gundurr,looks pretty good so far
11-04-2019T22:03:58,Twokinds,Anything look weird
11-04-2019T22:04:03,Ordithus,Red leveled up - he's actually being useful :D
11-04-2019T22:04:11,Bgrmystr2,"I see a lack of blarg, but otherwise, it looks good"
11-04-2019T22:04:36,Gundurr,"the perfect face is a little eary, but good so far"
11-04-2019T22:04:55,unsteddyphoenix,You mean apart from Raine?
11-04-2019T22:04:59,unsteddyphoenix,:fire::fire::fire:
11-04-2019T22:05:03,Gundurr,lol

11-04-2019T22:05:36,unsteddyphoenix,Impressed you did it from scratch so quickly
11-04-2019T22:05:48,Ordithus,Raine looks weird.  A cute weirdo <3
11-04-2019T22:05:56,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Best weirdo <3

11-04-2019T22:29:41,Watsup,you should not do that :V
11-04-2019T22:29:47,Nekonny,yeah
11-04-2019T22:30:12,Nekonny,"well, sometimes you need to see if isomethign isn't working out"
11-04-2019T22:30:23,Nekonny,"you can either carry on, give up or restart"
11-04-2019T22:30:33,Nekonny,abort retry fail
11-04-2019T22:30:37,Watsup,"never give up, never surrender"
11-04-2019T22:30:45,Nekonny,so I restartes
11-04-2019T22:31:12,Kullax,turns wat off and on again
11-04-2019T22:31:21,Nekonny,It's auch a big project I fear it's not gonna have a significant impact
11-04-2019T22:31:21,Gundurr,lul
11-04-2019T22:31:30,Nekonny,*yet i fear
11-04-2019T22:31:32,neropan,i'm in a state of almost sleep sheep while watching a guy play through fire and flames on a flute
11-04-2019T22:31:32,Nekonny,so
11-04-2019T22:31:36,Gundurr,"just put effort into, be confident"
11-04-2019T22:31:49,Nekonny,I build sandcastles... their fate is to the ocean
11-04-2019T22:31:50,neropan,i feel nothin
11-04-2019T22:33:17,Watsup,i feel happy
11-04-2019T22:33:28,RimaDraws,im ok
11-04-2019T22:33:33,Gundurr,I also feel happy
11-04-2019T22:33:37,Nekonny,"as it is said, all is vanity"
11-04-2019T22:33:46,Nekonny,"well, I feel happy too"
11-04-2019T22:33:54,Nekonny,thats good I imagine
11-04-2019T22:33:59,Gundurr,its good that we mostly feel happy
11-04-2019T22:34:19,SageSaga,what if everyone who didnt say how they feel feel terrible?
11-04-2019T22:34:31,Ordithus,I feel sleepy
11-04-2019T22:34:33,Gundurr,well they havent said anything
11-04-2019T22:34:38,RimaDraws,i am actually glad i can art again. remember how some people asked if my profile pic was kairi well i am actually working on a kairi picture now
11-04-2019T22:34:38,Ordithus,Which is neither happy nor terrible
11-04-2019T22:34:52,SageSaga,maybe they cant say anything because they just feel so bad
11-04-2019T22:35:00,Gundurr,good point
11-04-2019T22:35:18,Kullax,what's this? Social media? Why are we sharing how we feel?
11-04-2019T22:35:21,Gundurr,however they are watching this to probably feel better
11-04-2019T22:35:34,Watsup,"I wasn't sharing how I feel, I was quoting monty python"
11-04-2019T22:35:37,RimaDraws,i think its allowed to express how we feel
11-04-2019T22:35:45,Watsup,I'm not dead yet!
11-04-2019T22:35:48,Nekonny,Oh right ^^
11-04-2019T22:35:57,neropan,you're already ded
11-04-2019T22:35:59,Nekonny,Always look on the bright side of lift
11-04-2019T22:36:04,Kullax,"Silly Wat, it's only a flesh wound"
11-04-2019T22:36:06,Nekonny,whistles
11-04-2019T22:36:09,Watsup,"see, quoting monty python :V"

11-04-2019T22:36:34,FoxxTrotter,"Hi, Kullax."
11-04-2019T22:36:40,Kullax,Hey Foxxx
11-04-2019T22:38:34,Nekonny,I wonder how Tharkis is doing?
11-04-2019T22:38:45,RimaDraws,hm
11-04-2019T22:38:57,Nekonny,I could be suffering from travel withdraw DX
11-04-2019T22:39:05,SageSaga,...
11-04-2019T22:39:42,Nekonny,It's the one thinkg I look forward to sage
11-04-2019T22:40:11,Nekonny,and I havent gone anywhere in almost 6 months
11-04-2019T22:40:13,SageSaga,i like traveling too
11-04-2019T22:40:18,Nekonny,its driving me crazy
11-04-2019T22:40:19,RimaDraws,i wish i could

11-04-2019T22:40:43,Twokinds,I hate traveling.
11-04-2019T22:40:51,MuonNeutrino,god how can raine keep getting more and more adorable looking
11-04-2019T22:40:58,Watsup,"are you going to anthrocon, neko?"
11-04-2019T22:41:05,RimaDraws,"i want to go to the beach, be near the ocean, and feel the sand on my feet"
11-04-2019T22:41:13,SageSaga,we all are
11-04-2019T22:41:14,Ordithus,"It is Raine's superpower, Muon"

11-04-2019T22:41:22,SageSaga,im going to anthro- Rons going- Toms going
11-04-2019T22:41:23,Watsup,"neat, I'll see you there V:"
11-04-2019T22:41:36,MarvTheHugPharaoh,stay safe you three
11-04-2019T22:41:36,Nekonny,"and that will be good, although it's more for work"
11-04-2019T22:41:44,Gundurr,I want to live up in a secluded town in the woods
11-04-2019T22:41:55,RimaDraws,i had planned to go but plans got ruined
11-04-2019T22:41:57,Nekonny,the most fun part of it is seeing everyone there
11-04-2019T22:42:03,MuonNeutrino,i'd love to travel but my preferred destinations are a bit out of reach >.>
11-04-2019T22:42:13,Watsup,We'll get our traditionally 10 minutes of hanging out with Ron and then never see him again
11-04-2019T22:42:18,Nekonny,but Ive been putting a lot of pressure on myself to get an interesting table display
11-04-2019T22:42:35,Nekonny,but I'm so focused on one aspect of it I fear it may end up a failure
11-04-2019T22:42:45,Nekonny,or that I'll burn myself out and give up
11-04-2019T22:42:53,Kullax,10 min is better than no min :P
11-04-2019T22:43:03,Nekonny,If I manage t o find them that is
11-04-2019T22:43:09,Twokinds,"I like being places, just not getting there."
11-04-2019T22:43:09,Watsup,lol
11-04-2019T22:43:18,RimaDraws,driving sucks.
11-04-2019T22:43:19,Aimbotexe,Based Tom
11-04-2019T22:43:34,Nekonny,its better if you are traveling with people
11-04-2019T22:43:35,Ordithus,commercial air travel is pretty ick
11-04-2019T22:43:50,Gundurr,driving terrifies me

11-04-2019T22:44:02,RimaDraws,i dont have people to go with nekonny
11-04-2019T22:44:14,FoxxTrotter,I don't mind driving. Plenty of scenic places to visit. :0)
11-04-2019T22:45:09,Gundurr,I cant satnd it
11-04-2019T22:47:58,RimaDraws,i cant stand driving

11-04-2019T22:48:55,unsteddyphoenix,I deserved it

11-04-2019T22:59:14,Twokinds,Yeah Sam and Colin

11-04-2019T22:59:31,Twokinds,And the Trains are because of that credit card part. Long distance is expensive.

11-04-2019T23:04:29,iliar,Hm If you have short distance teleportation technology you can create long distance teleportation lines.
11-04-2019T23:04:35,iliar,"For example, if the maximum teleportation distance is 30km, you can build transfer points every 20km. You will need to exit one teleport and immediately enter the next one. It will still be much faster than trains."
11-04-2019T23:04:42,MuonNeutrino,yeah but it coudl get too expensive

11-04-2019T23:05:19,RimaDraws,i loved the rotary phones

11-04-2019T23:05:26,MuonNeutrino,"if going a couple miles if 5 bucks that's ok, but then going 100 miles is suddenly 500$ and you're like 'nah i'll take a train'"
11-04-2019T23:05:57,Ordithus,But if the instant travel is only for short distances which wouldn't take that long anywyas
11-04-2019T23:07:33,Twokinds,I imagine cities themselves would be layed out completely differently.
11-04-2019T23:07:40,Bgrmystr2,"but it's instant, Ord"
11-04-2019T23:07:52,Bgrmystr2,it would probably take quite a long time to get there otherwise.. probably
11-04-2019T23:08:06,MuonNeutrino,"it also would be point-to-point, i.e. takes you direct to your door, there's no train to your front door"
11-04-2019T23:08:11,Ordithus,Yeah because there aren't any stairs anymore
11-04-2019T23:08:19,Ordithus,Faster than climbing the outside of a building :P
11-04-2019T23:08:24,Nekonny,I may have missed somethign
11-04-2019T23:08:25,Twokinds,"Probably very sprawling, with no public inner city traffic. Just goods and bulk freight delivery."
11-04-2019T23:08:30,Nekonny,twokinds has trains
11-04-2019T23:08:54,MuonNeutrino,i suppose it depends on how much the teleporters cost
11-04-2019T23:08:55,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I like trains
11-04-2019T23:08:55,Nekonny,?

11-04-2019T23:08:59,BadFoMo,In the future?
11-04-2019T23:09:05,Nekonny,oh
11-04-2019T23:09:06,Bgrmystr2,I don't think twokinds has trains. It's a different story. Clearly it will be called Threekinds.
11-04-2019T23:09:11,MuonNeutrino,if one doesn't feel like blowing 10$ to teleport downtown one might walk

11-04-2019T23:12:57,Twokinds,It takes people from one place and drops them off at another.
11-04-2019T23:13:06,RimaDraws,oh cool. i love that
11-04-2019T23:13:16,BadFoMo,What's the 'T' building then?
