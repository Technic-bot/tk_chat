12-09-2019T03:59:42,CrimsonQuill,Got to the latest comic page last night
12-09-2019T03:59:46,CrimsonQuill,Poor Raine XD
12-09-2019T03:59:59,CrimsonQuill,I wonder what Rose has in mind for Red.

12-09-2019T04:21:07,CrimsonQuill,I hope that she's able to reverse that if it happens...
12-09-2019T04:21:13,CrimsonQuill,"C'mon, Raine, you can do it!"
12-09-2019T04:21:23,CrimsonQuill,She has determination-she just needs a nudge.
12-09-2019T04:22:21,CrimsonQuill,Also...Tom was right about Rose not being the best tutor...I was actually rather surprised at how annoyed Raine's face was too-sort of like some of the others. Looks a bit odd to see her so...sulky.
12-09-2019T04:22:33,CrimsonQuill,"Then again, I suppose I would if it happened to me..."

12-09-2019T07:56:06,WINDOWS98SE,Nope.
12-09-2019T07:56:14,WINDOWS98SE,And no Windows Laura either...
12-09-2019T07:56:24,WINDOWS98SE,But at least we've got Laurafox.

12-09-2019T14:42:00,CrimsonQuill,Welll
12-09-2019T14:42:03,CrimsonQuill,I'm just doodling
12-09-2019T14:42:32,CrimsonQuill,Since I haven't heard back from Tom about copyright and stuff I've just bee drawing my second OC's ref. sheet.
12-09-2019T14:42:34,CrimsonQuill,That's done.
12-09-2019T14:42:49,CrimsonQuill,So now I'm doodling the fireteam as I hope they'll end up...
12-09-2019T14:43:09,CrimsonQuill,"That, and watching RvB and Halo infinity war parody trailers."
12-09-2019T15:25:32,SpazztasticKiwi,so
12-09-2019T15:25:48,SpazztasticKiwi,one of the cart collectors left his phone in the bathroom
12-09-2019T15:25:54,CrimsonQuill,Oh dear
12-09-2019T15:25:55,SpazztasticKiwi,someone picked it up
12-09-2019T15:26:13,CrimsonQuill,Is 'someone' a person who can return it?
12-09-2019T15:26:15,SpazztasticKiwi,he didn’t know about findmyiphone tracker
12-09-2019T15:26:43,SpazztasticKiwi,so he logged onto mine and we pinged his phone right as the guy was wondering around garden center
12-09-2019T15:26:58,CrimsonQuill,Oh
12-09-2019T15:27:02,CrimsonQuill,So...
12-09-2019T15:27:02,SpazztasticKiwi,“I was gonna turn it in”
12-09-2019T15:27:13,CrimsonQuill,"Ha, yeah, right."
12-09-2019T17:19:44,CrimsonQuill,Goodnight all.
12-09-2019T17:20:08,CrimsonQuill,"When Tom appears, please tell him I said hi."

12-09-2019T20:26:00,tehbear,stress?
12-09-2019T20:26:06,LannAF,"I've managed to (possibly) track it down to maybe a pinched nerve or something, massaging a very specific part deep in my neck makes me ""feel"" the entire area it's hurting"
12-09-2019T20:26:11,LannAF,It's only for my left arm.
12-09-2019T20:26:19,AnuSekaniArt,I have that happen with my left shoulder blade

12-09-2019T20:26:40,LannAF,I've tried
12-09-2019T20:26:44,AnuSekaniArt,Try getting a massage and tell them to focus on that area
12-09-2019T20:26:47,LannAF,"I've tried stretches, asked sticky to massage me"

12-09-2019T20:27:41,AnuSekaniArt,Maybe have a doctor take a look at it?
12-09-2019T20:27:48,LannAF,Because it's so weird how it makes me feel it all the way when I press
12-09-2019T20:28:02,LannAF,it's a a strange sensation but it feels like I'm releasing the pressure when I do it
12-09-2019T20:28:05,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s all those video games
12-09-2019T20:28:08,LannAF,I don't know if I should be doing it though

12-09-2019T20:29:04,SpazztasticKiwi,too much solar power
12-09-2019T20:29:22,LannAF,I felt like I was about to pull a mary poppins and fly off to spread the good name of solar to the winds
12-09-2019T20:29:30,MoonDance,try some intense yoga for a few days
12-09-2019T20:29:48,tehbear,you got the power Lann
12-09-2019T20:30:06,LannAF,I don't even know -what- yoga to do
12-09-2019T20:30:08,SageSaga,dont do intense anything if you have muscle pain or physical injury
12-09-2019T20:30:17,LannAF,That's good advice
12-09-2019T20:30:19,LannAF,but I have a job

12-09-2019T20:30:43,MoonDance,slightly less intense yoga then
12-09-2019T20:30:46,SageSaga,its also called a coma
12-09-2019T20:30:48,LannAF,and it hurts way more when I lay on it
12-09-2019T20:30:52,LannAF,can I have that
12-09-2019T20:30:59,LannAF,so I have an excuse to dream and not go to work

12-09-2019T20:40:14,Mikemkke034,Hey tehbear
12-09-2019T20:40:15,SageSaga,Episode 100 is INSANE

12-09-2019T20:40:24,Zakuru,lol
12-09-2019T20:40:31,FloofyCat,Perfectly balanced
12-09-2019T20:40:35,FloofyCat,Like all things should be
12-09-2019T20:40:43,SageSaga,if it came out a different year it might be seen as one of the best animated sequences of the year
12-09-2019T20:40:46,HoverdudeXL,Oh hi floofycat
12-09-2019T20:40:54,SageSaga,but it had to happen with Demon Slayer going XD
12-09-2019T20:40:59,ContagiousBordem16,It’s better animated than Boruto
12-09-2019T20:41:27,SageSaga,i dunno
12-09-2019T20:41:38,SageSaga,Boruto's quality control seems to exist-
12-09-2019T20:41:47,SpazztasticKiwi,that’s white haired boy in boruto has something wrong with his eyes
12-09-2019T20:42:07,SageSaga,"Black Clover had a scene where a guy removed his sunglasses, wiped tears from his eyes- and his glasses were back on- and then he put them back on"
12-09-2019T20:42:08,tehbear,refuses to watch anything with fewer fps than Steamboat Willie
12-09-2019T20:42:11,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s like they made him without eyelids
12-09-2019T20:42:55,SpazztasticKiwi,they tried Sage; they tried

12-09-2019T20:54:30,LannAF,pffft
12-09-2019T20:54:36,FloofyCat,Tbh it's normal when you don't want your hands greasy

12-09-2019T20:54:40,LannAF,Soup

12-09-2019T20:55:05,LannAF,think of anything other than seafood and I would probably drink milk with it
12-09-2019T20:55:10,tehbear,phones rust?
12-09-2019T20:55:13,MoonDance,two different milks cannot be combined

12-09-2019T20:55:36,SpazztasticKiwi,"speaking of which, not all y’all probably caught it but a cart collector guy left his phone in the bathroom"
12-09-2019T20:55:42,LannAF,It's one of the only livestream chats I can stand
12-09-2019T20:55:44,MoonDance,So i have to stipple the bones of a foot and my hands hurt

12-09-2019T20:57:05,SpazztasticKiwi,it was an iphone
12-09-2019T20:57:08,MuonNeutrino,oof. rose is bringing out the heavy artillery this strip
12-09-2019T20:57:18,TraceLegacyXI,Yep lol
12-09-2019T20:57:26,MuonNeutrino,'attack him'
12-09-2019T20:57:27,AcePilotIV,i feel like i fell off a cliif and got hit by  a train

12-09-2019T20:57:31,MuonNeutrino,"or that's my interpretation, anyway"
12-09-2019T20:57:32,InTheLionsDen,"Yup, ordering Raine to shred Red"
12-09-2019T20:57:42,TraceLegacyXI,Y tho??
12-09-2019T20:57:46,FloofyCat,Oh gosh Muon that actually makes sense
12-09-2019T20:57:48,MuonNeutrino,to get her to resist the collar
12-09-2019T20:57:53,SpazztasticKiwi,when he found the guy who had it it was “oh I was gonna turn it in..”
12-09-2019T20:57:55,FloofyCat,Oh crap that makes sense
12-09-2019T20:58:00,MuonNeutrino,the 'looking at the shredded curtains' thing is a dead giveaway
12-09-2019T20:58:05,LannAF,uh huh
12-09-2019T20:58:08,LannAF,dude
12-09-2019T20:58:12,LannAF,At my workplace

12-09-2019T20:58:16,TraceLegacyXI,What is suddenly making sense to you all?
12-09-2019T20:58:22,SpazztasticKiwi,don’t put your phone down in the bathroom
12-09-2019T20:58:26,LannAF,I didn't realize that all the jokes about people acting shitty to construction workers was true

12-09-2019T20:58:34,LannAF,yeah seriously
12-09-2019T20:58:35,TraceLegacyXI,Yes
12-09-2019T20:58:38,TraceLegacyXI,That’s common sense
12-09-2019T20:58:41,FloofyCat,@TraceLegacyXI Rose might be telling Raine to attack Red to make Raine resist the collar.
12-09-2019T20:58:43,Sclimshady,Im lucky my job sites are remote
12-09-2019T20:58:47,Sclimshady,No hasslers

12-09-2019T20:59:13,LannAF,went outside and began yelling at construction workers to move all their shit
12-09-2019T20:59:16,LannAF,how they couldn't be there
12-09-2019T20:59:18,LannAF,blah blah blah

12-09-2019T20:59:31,TraceLegacyXI,@FloofyCat yeah you’re probably right
12-09-2019T20:59:40,LannAF,"I'm an electrician apprentice, for now I do solar at this company yup"

12-09-2019T21:00:10,SpazztasticKiwi,"what I found the most aggravating was after we collected it, and he was relieved and happy the work gossip came up to us and told him “oh you better watch out now; she’ll try to marry you”"

12-09-2019T21:00:53,SpazztasticKiwi,I am older
12-09-2019T21:00:54,LannAF,I've been parking in a spot I -know- nobody parks at under a shaded area
12-09-2019T21:01:14,LannAF,"I had an old lady tell me ""you can't park there. it's for residents only"""

12-09-2019T21:02:34,FloofyCat,white noise blocks out the power tools and hammering so I could actually sleep.
12-09-2019T21:02:39,SageSaga,i would put the cone in my car and as i was leaving put it back - so i can keep using the spot...
12-09-2019T21:02:42,SpazztasticKiwi,I would be a horror if I lived near someone like that
12-09-2019T21:02:45,LannAF,Then another lady gives me a story about her mother needing the parking space since she's coming back from dialysis
12-09-2019T21:02:58,LannAF,"she was nice and kind so I said ""okay! I'll move"" since she said it was only for that day"

12-09-2019T21:56:37,LannAF,If I were you I'd give my own opinion after a short vid on it

12-09-2019T21:57:02,Sclimshady,My install went pretty smooth
12-09-2019T21:57:21,unsteddyphoenix,I have to convert MBR to GPT and a bunch of other jargon I am strugglin to decipher
12-09-2019T21:57:23,tehbear,i dont understand why they keep changing it. win2k was perfect :P
12-09-2019T21:57:24,AcePilotIV,my laptop keeps lagging so much when i run warthunder
12-09-2019T21:57:32,AcePilotIV,keeps freezing
12-09-2019T21:57:46,AcePilotIV,i remember when i used to play on 3 fps
12-09-2019T21:57:53,CrRAR,I think a full reformat is required for the conversion unstedd
12-09-2019T21:57:58,AcePilotIV,damn it was painful
12-09-2019T21:58:03,LannAF,that reminds me of when I first started playing Wildstar at like 10-13 fps
12-09-2019T21:58:10,MarvTheHugPharaoh,CrRAR pretty sure you're right.
12-09-2019T21:58:10,NezumiYuki,DEM FRAMES Ace!!!   Holy cow that's a lotta frames!
12-09-2019T21:58:13,AcePilotIV,and ultra low quality
12-09-2019T21:58:24,unsteddyphoenix,I only have to format the USBthough right? Not the drive im installin it onto?
12-09-2019T21:58:36,CrRAR,Are you clean installing?
12-09-2019T21:58:40,LannAF,oof.
12-09-2019T21:58:50,tehbear,as long as its not seconds per frame
12-09-2019T21:59:05,LannAF,even to me that's unplayable bear.
12-09-2019T21:59:15,CrRAR,GPT is important if you have UEFI or if your main disk is larger than 2TB
12-09-2019T21:59:19,LannAF,I still played and didn't do too horrible with 10-20 fps early on in my gaming life.
12-09-2019T21:59:29,LannAF,I got used to it
12-09-2019T21:59:33,AcePilotIV,same
12-09-2019T21:59:38,LannAF,"When I upgraded and learned more about WS though, oh man"
12-09-2019T21:59:40,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"If the drive is new or reformatted before install, should be pretty speedy"
12-09-2019T21:59:44,ZRO4825,I remember playing CS1.6 at 6-15 FPS.
12-09-2019T21:59:48,LannAF,I became one of the top players for my class in the server
12-09-2019T21:59:48,AcePilotIV,but my laptop started breaking down
12-09-2019T21:59:52,LannAF,I miss that game.
12-09-2019T22:00:01,AspiringNoodle,I remember playing WoW at 3 - 4 fps <3

12-09-2019T22:00:48,unsteddyphoenix,Id rather play minesweeper
12-09-2019T22:00:48,Sclimshady,Thats like 26 less that bad FPS
12-09-2019T22:00:51,LannAF,I miss old Garrysmod before youtuber invasion

12-09-2019T22:20:20,LannAF,she turned around and gave me a sketch of the llama potion from emperor's new groove
12-09-2019T22:20:20,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve seen and told a few guys “you know she was flirting with you right” a few times don’t worry
12-09-2019T22:20:22,LannAF,and made a bad pun.

12-09-2019T22:29:47,AcePilotIV,and a bit of bfv
12-09-2019T22:29:54,AcePilotIV,but nothing else

12-09-2019T22:31:28,SageSaga,i was really hoping they would add Prowler when they announced the guy in charge of Iceborne was the guy who dirrected MHGEN

12-09-2019T23:52:51,SageSaga,there's more than one way to learn something...
12-09-2019T23:53:06,BadFoMo,Very true.

12-09-2019T23:54:29,Ordithus,... no but I did just figure it out as soon as you said that
12-09-2019T23:54:38,Ordithus,:csagesaga-philhuh:
12-09-2019T23:55:34,unsteddyphoenix,The sum of the answers equals 9?
12-09-2019T23:55:36,SageSaga,9x1=9 9x2=18 (1 + 8 totals 9) 9x3=27 (2+7 = 9)
12-09-2019T23:55:42,SageSaga,yep
12-09-2019T23:55:50,unsteddyphoenix,Except for 9*1
12-09-2019T23:55:53,unsteddyphoenix,11*
12-09-2019T23:56:03,unsteddyphoenix,Which breaks it

12-09-2019T23:57:15,SageSaga,when does 9 ever multiply out to be 91?
12-09-2019T23:57:26,Mikemkke034,It doesn't
12-09-2019T23:57:34,Ordithus,9*11=99 9+9=18 so not 9
12-09-2019T23:57:35,Mikemkke034,It would be 9x9+10
12-09-2019T23:57:55,SageSaga,Unsteddy needs to go back to SCHOOL
