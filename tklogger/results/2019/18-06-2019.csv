18-06-2019T00:13:39,AspiringNoodle,Getting back into drawing is fun.
18-06-2019T00:13:59,AspiringNoodle,And also makes me realize how awkward graphics tablets are when you don't look at what you're drawing :ptv-laugh:

18-06-2019T15:07:53,AspiringNoodle,Day [I stopped counting]: Still no signs of a sale for Clip Studio Paint.  My willpower is waning.  I fear it will not be long before I make a terrible mistake.
18-06-2019T15:27:27,TerraTheWizard,it's almost summer
18-06-2019T15:27:30,TerraTheWizard,that might be a sale
18-06-2019T16:04:36,Dadrobit,Bruh. Patience. It's a Wednesday in the middle of June. There is no reason for them to do a sale for at least a few weeks. Check back on the week of July 4th or so. And sub to their Twitter.
18-06-2019T16:52:22,AspiringNoodle,"To be fair, they've had sales in June before.  I checked xD"
18-06-2019T17:01:59,Bgrmystr2,"in their defense, they probably didn't do june sales RIGHT after they already had a sale."
18-06-2019T17:02:03,Bgrmystr2,"also, gmornin"

18-06-2019T17:04:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I swear my phones so dry I’m paying $65 for an alarm clock
18-06-2019T17:05:13,SpazztasticKiwi,They called me to come in early today and I was confused on what the hell that ringing noise was
18-06-2019T17:10:57,AspiringNoodle,xD
18-06-2019T17:20:13,TeapotOfDoom,Well seems like your day is going nice
18-06-2019T17:20:32,TeapotOfDoom,Somebody just stole some of my laundry
18-06-2019T17:20:35,TeapotOfDoom,Again
18-06-2019T17:21:31,AspiringNoodle,...why
18-06-2019T17:21:32,AspiringNoodle,Just why
18-06-2019T18:06:04,TeapotOfDoom,Dunno
18-06-2019T18:20:05,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
18-06-2019T18:24:57,AspiringNoodle,"Ich... going from Honey Crisp to Fuji, the Fuji seems a bit like a letdown :/"
18-06-2019T18:47:26,CrRAR,"Fuji more tart, right?"
18-06-2019T18:47:58,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-rose::apple:
18-06-2019T18:49:40,AspiringNoodle,It seems less juicy / less bold in its flavor.
18-06-2019T18:50:11,AspiringNoodle,"It's like you got to a nice restaurant and have a great burger, but it's super expensive, so you look for cheaper options"
18-06-2019T18:50:39,AspiringNoodle,"Then you find other restaurants supposedly making the same thing, same listed ingredient, but when you eat it it just seems like a lesser version."
18-06-2019T18:51:03,AspiringNoodle,Fuji feels like a knockoff in comparison xD
18-06-2019T18:52:12,AspiringNoodle,I wonder what Macintosh apples are like.
18-06-2019T18:54:58,CrRAR,"Yeah Honey Crisps are a ""premium"" apple it seems."
18-06-2019T18:55:34,AspiringNoodle,"Make apples great again, nothing but honey crisps"
18-06-2019T18:55:36,Ordithus,"by premium, you mean the best <3"
18-06-2019T18:55:46,CrRAR,I forget which ones either Cortland or McIntosh. have more of a grainy texture.
18-06-2019T18:56:03,CrRAR,Not as snappy like Reds or HoneyCrisp.
18-06-2019T18:56:19,AspiringNoodle,Probably Cortland
18-06-2019T18:56:34,CrRAR,indeed Ord haha
18-06-2019T18:56:53,AspiringNoodle,"I agree with Ord, so far Honey Crisps are the best~"
18-06-2019T18:57:08,CrRAR,I'm sad Rainier cherry season is over ;_;
18-06-2019T18:57:12,AspiringNoodle,"That said, I need to find a suitable, cheaper, alternative so I don't bankrupt myself on apples ;_;"
18-06-2019T18:57:41,Ordithus,I have strawberries... I should eat some tonight
18-06-2019T18:57:46,AspiringNoodle,"Where I live, Fuji/Gala are $2/lb, and Honey Crisps are $3/lbs"
18-06-2019T18:58:00,AspiringNoodle,"If I remember correctly, Macintoshes are $1.70/lb"
18-06-2019T18:58:14,CrRAR,Yeah you can get a bag for like nothing.
18-06-2019T18:59:02,CrRAR,"I liked red delicious for the longest time, then discovered Honey Crisps."
18-06-2019T18:59:17,AspiringNoodle,"Meh, Red's USED to be good :/"
18-06-2019T18:59:26,CrRAR,I kno
18-06-2019T19:03:39,AspiringNoodle,...Idea for sketch
18-06-2019T19:03:55,AspiringNoodle,"Apple place on the middle of a bed, a cat keidran flipping out"
18-06-2019T19:04:19,AspiringNoodle,Maybe Maeve for extra cute points?

18-06-2019T22:47:14,SpazztasticKiwi,it was sweet. But now my mouth is like “why did you do that?”
18-06-2019T23:47:41,SpazztasticKiwi,I might go to bed early
