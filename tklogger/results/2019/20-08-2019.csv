20-08-2019T15:36:02,TeapotOfDoom,especially if you challenge yourself to test new software
20-08-2019T15:36:24,Mikemkke034,:joy:
20-08-2019T15:36:29,TeapotOfDoom,I'm to tired for this shit... But well the installation ran like a breeze

20-08-2019T15:40:01,Mikemkke034,I'm sure you could do it too
20-08-2019T15:40:55,TeapotOfDoom,well i dunno. uni's quite demanding. in a strang you do spend almost no time actually doing stuff but afterwards you're still done for the day way
20-08-2019T15:41:39,Mikemkke034,I'm still in Highschool :yum:
20-08-2019T15:42:02,TeapotOfDoom,you're working in high school? then hats off even more

20-08-2019T15:43:28,TeapotOfDoom,I'm still not sure how the american and european system compare (at least the system where I'm from) but i guess you would be between 15 and 18 right?

20-08-2019T15:47:08,Mikemkke034,But my potato pc can't handle most modpacks
20-08-2019T15:47:09,TeapotOfDoom,also tingles my engineering senses
20-08-2019T15:47:23,Mikemkke034,Lol
20-08-2019T15:47:29,TeapotOfDoom,yeah fbt is just a club to the processor
20-08-2019T15:47:44,Mikemkke034,I'm running an i3
20-08-2019T15:48:03,Mikemkke034,It's a Lenovo Ideacentre
20-08-2019T15:49:33,TeapotOfDoom,ok i get why it can't take it
20-08-2019T15:49:43,Mikemkke034,Did you look the pc up?

20-08-2019T15:50:46,TeapotOfDoom,lemme guess
20-08-2019T15:51:35,TeapotOfDoom,how old is the machine
20-08-2019T15:51:50,Mikemkke034,2016-17 I think
20-08-2019T15:51:54,Mikemkke034,I've had it for awhile
20-08-2019T15:52:00,TeapotOfDoom,"no dedicated graphic, 34wh battery, about 5 hours of battery life. 256gb of sata ssd"
20-08-2019T15:52:16,Mikemkke034,34wh battery?

20-08-2019T15:53:14,TeapotOfDoom,that was just my guess i would be curious how close i was
20-08-2019T15:54:10,Mikemkke034,Lenovo Ideacentre 300s - OIHH
20-08-2019T15:58:17,TeapotOfDoom,OIHH?
20-08-2019T15:58:28,Mikemkke034,Yeah. Or 0IHH

20-08-2019T16:04:50,Mikemkke034,I don't have a GPU
20-08-2019T16:04:55,Mikemkke034,Aside from onboard

20-08-2019T16:10:15,TeapotOfDoom,i just messed up the permissions on the save file so bad i had to remove them with sudo
20-08-2019T16:10:17,RimaDraws,sorry i went away....had to call my boss...
20-08-2019T16:10:21,TeapotOfDoom,how did i do that
20-08-2019T16:10:25,Mikemkke034,It's okay Rima
20-08-2019T16:10:40,Mikemkke034,I've been checking in on Discord. Are you okay?
20-08-2019T16:11:11,RimaDraws,no im not...
20-08-2019T16:11:20,Mikemkke034,Anything I could do?
20-08-2019T16:11:36,RimaDraws,not till i find out who is spreading these rumors no. but thanks for trying
20-08-2019T16:12:13,Mikemkke034,I hope everything goes well for you
20-08-2019T16:13:30,Sclimshady,Thats not a very nice thing to do
20-08-2019T16:13:50,TeapotOfDoom,yo what happened?
20-08-2019T16:16:47,RimaDraws,someone is spreading a rumor that i got fired and for throwing my purse and telling my boss adam that i was tired of this shit.
20-08-2019T16:18:14,Sclimshady,"That is extremely childish,  did this persons parents not love them enough?"
20-08-2019T16:18:51,RimaDraws,well i dont know who it is but i think it was someone who is jealous of me
20-08-2019T16:19:37,Mikemkke034,I'm headed back to drawing. Have a buzz of inspiration
20-08-2019T16:20:21,Sclimshady,Gotta be real jealous to stoop that low
20-08-2019T16:20:36,Sclimshady,Good luck with the inspiration Mike\
20-08-2019T16:20:39,TeapotOfDoom,jealousy seems to bring out the worst in peope jeez
20-08-2019T16:20:46,TeapotOfDoom,bye mike
20-08-2019T16:21:28,TeapotOfDoom,how did your boss take it? he knows he didn't fire you so that should at least make it a bit easier
20-08-2019T16:22:26,RimaDraws,he said he is going to look into it and said to not pay any mind till he does
20-08-2019T16:23:24,TeapotOfDoom,sounds like you got him on your side
20-08-2019T16:23:39,TeapotOfDoom,which i would take as assuring tbh
20-08-2019T16:25:13,TeapotOfDoom,the one thing i'll never get is why people think you'll be the one who's getting punished
20-08-2019T16:25:48,TeapotOfDoom,once it's out who the real culprit is they're more often then not the one who's in a really bad plaec
20-08-2019T16:26:03,RimaDraws,well i know the truth
20-08-2019T16:26:09,RimaDraws,i never said any of that so i know
20-08-2019T16:26:41,TeapotOfDoom,and from what i got your boss seems to think you're saying the truth
20-08-2019T16:26:49,TeapotOfDoom,right?
20-08-2019T16:27:08,RimaDraws,he said he hadnt heard of me being terminated because he is over my other boss
20-08-2019T16:27:38,TeapotOfDoom,which would give you creadability
20-08-2019T16:30:24,RimaDraws,yea exactly
20-08-2019T16:32:19,TeapotOfDoom,so to me that sounds like he would believe you and not the rumors. which means if they find out who talked smack (and they most likely will) this person is pretty much screwed
20-08-2019T16:33:26,RimaDraws,they try to not believe the rumors till they get things straight
20-08-2019T16:34:44,TeapotOfDoom,so even though the whole situation is kinda bs right now you're in a quite good position
20-08-2019T16:37:38,TeapotOfDoom,the best thing that you could do now is stay in close contact with them in case the alleded rumor spreader decides to spread a new rumor
20-08-2019T16:38:25,RimaDraws,well i am not trusting anyone
20-08-2019T16:38:52,TeapotOfDoom,you think your boss could be the one at fault as well?
20-08-2019T16:39:11,TeapotOfDoom,that would not be logical to me
20-08-2019T16:39:38,TeapotOfDoom,there are way worse things a boss could do then spreading rumors
20-08-2019T16:40:46,RimaDraws,no i donr
20-08-2019T16:40:48,RimaDraws,dont
20-08-2019T16:41:09,TeapotOfDoom,ok good
20-08-2019T16:41:16,TeapotOfDoom,one less person to worry about
20-08-2019T16:41:58,TeapotOfDoom,as long as you've got your boss on your side i'm sure you'll get through this
20-08-2019T16:42:42,TeapotOfDoom,also you were talking about discord? are y'all on neons server?
20-08-2019T16:43:46,RimaDraws,nope
20-08-2019T16:43:50,CrRAR,"I didn't totally have my boss on my side all the time, but then he quit so..."
20-08-2019T16:43:56,Sclimshady,I am not
20-08-2019T16:43:57,CrRAR,\o/
20-08-2019T16:44:11,CrRAR,I guess I won? lol
20-08-2019T16:44:22,SpazztasticKiwi,I have my own server for me
20-08-2019T16:44:33,SpazztasticKiwi,other than that it’s direct
20-08-2019T16:44:55,Sclimshady,I have a server so I can make emotes and thats all I use it for
20-08-2019T16:45:03,SpazztasticKiwi,and TK & Markiplier Manor
20-08-2019T16:47:43,TeapotOfDoom,lol sclim efficient use
20-08-2019T16:49:00,TeapotOfDoom,i could get the role as tech wizard ~(*o*)~
20-08-2019T16:49:10,TeapotOfDoom,just because it sounds funy
20-08-2019T16:53:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera did a bad
20-08-2019T16:53:41,SpazztasticKiwi,and he’s cut his face
20-08-2019T16:54:19,Sclimshady,I thought cats were supposed to be graceful
20-08-2019T16:54:38,TeapotOfDoom,how did he manage to cut his freakin face?
20-08-2019T16:57:35,SpazztasticKiwi,he got in the garbage and got a food can
20-08-2019T16:57:51,SpazztasticKiwi,cut his lip
20-08-2019T16:58:10,SpazztasticKiwi,"and I’m not sure Bagheera’s a cat, he’s sure not graceful"
20-08-2019T17:01:35,TeapotOfDoom,well done
20-08-2019T17:01:57,TeapotOfDoom,seems like greed and not curiosity killed the kat
20-08-2019T17:01:59,TeapotOfDoom,cat
20-08-2019T17:02:21,TeapotOfDoom,kat's the opposite fo greedy
20-08-2019T17:03:54,SpazztasticKiwi,she’s spent the better half of 15 years after the same man
20-08-2019T17:11:04,Sclimshady,"She knows what she wants, ok"
20-08-2019T17:28:40,SpazztasticKiwi,a man that’s emotionally unavailable to her?
20-08-2019T17:29:57,TeapotOfDoom,how did this just turn into a discussion about kats love life
20-08-2019T17:31:04,TeapotOfDoom,anyway i'm hittin the hay
20-08-2019T17:31:19,TeapotOfDoom,night guys! :ctwokinds-RainezZz:
