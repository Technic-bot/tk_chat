26-10-2019T15:28:52,LordSnax,Get something with a dedicated graphics card or chip. Don't go with anything that uses intigrated graphics.
26-10-2019T15:29:04,AspiringNoodle,Integrated graphics suuuuuuuuuuuucks ;_;
26-10-2019T15:29:16,AspiringNoodle,"Unless AMD, then gud -w-"
26-10-2019T15:29:18,HoverdudeXL,Lol
26-10-2019T15:29:21,vevans0009,I only played Diabla 3 on ps4.  Cute game.
26-10-2019T15:29:27,ThingsAreMoving,KiTA DM with source about the first person looter shooter pls
26-10-2019T15:29:47,JojoF2415,Happy 16 years Tom. I apologize that I’m late. I had things to do.
26-10-2019T15:29:49,TeapotOfDoom,even then noodle i tried recording video on a laptop with obs it just does not work without graphics
26-10-2019T15:29:57,AspiringNoodle,dang
26-10-2019T15:30:02,LordSnax,I agree! AMD does have very good integrated graphics
26-10-2019T15:30:10,TeapotOfDoom,was intel graphics tho
26-10-2019T15:30:12,vevans0009,"And more to comr, baby!"
26-10-2019T15:30:17,AspiringNoodle,There's yer problem!
26-10-2019T15:30:20,Robablo,Who's shorts are those!
26-10-2019T15:30:26,TeapotOfDoom,also the stuff amd does can not really be called integrated
26-10-2019T15:30:28,AnuSekaniArt,"Oof, Intel Iris XD"
26-10-2019T15:30:28,vevans0009,Keiths
26-10-2019T15:30:33,AnuSekaniArt,That's rough lol
26-10-2019T15:30:33,Mippy,Keef
26-10-2019T15:30:37,AspiringNoodle,AMD's integrated graphics on their 3rd gen stuff is effectively a low end discrete gpu
26-10-2019T15:30:48,tehbear,as long as it works
26-10-2019T15:30:48,LordSnax,Keith's shorts
26-10-2019T15:30:51,TeapotOfDoom,if you look at the specifics it is

26-10-2019T15:31:33,TeapotOfDoom,they use the same interconnect as they do for their dedicated stuff (i think) they once talked about using infinity fabric for the big guns as well
26-10-2019T15:31:36,HoverdudeXL,Yea

26-10-2019T21:51:00,Ordithus,All work and no play makes Kiwi something something
26-10-2019T21:51:07,RimaDraws,a dull girl
26-10-2019T21:51:53,SpazztasticKiwi,made me hungry
26-10-2019T21:52:10,SpazztasticKiwi,which added to the hissing at people idea
26-10-2019T21:52:22,SpazztasticKiwi,I got a pizza and went home
26-10-2019T21:52:31,Ordithus,pizza solves hangry

26-10-2019T21:53:17,SpazztasticKiwi,even though he knows he can’t be having cheese

26-10-2019T21:57:40,SpazztasticKiwi,and I’ve found some of the best comedy I’ve heard
26-10-2019T21:57:53,SpazztasticKiwi,3 minute clips and this guy is 👌🏻
26-10-2019T21:58:55,SpazztasticKiwi,you ever seen a video of a guy doing pelvic thrusts with a weight on him?
26-10-2019T21:59:26,Ordithus,"uh no, I have not"
26-10-2019T21:59:37,RimaDraws,lol wut
26-10-2019T22:00:08,SpazztasticKiwi,"it’s the comedians video, so a react video and of course I don’t promise you’ll like it but"
26-10-2019T22:00:12,SpazztasticKiwi,https://youtu.be/9k3RJgo_JxE
26-10-2019T22:02:03,SpazztasticKiwi,guy in the background with the red shirt  in tears
26-10-2019T22:02:53,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-keithdotdotdot:
26-10-2019T22:04:54,SpazztasticKiwi,somebody needs to go get their friend
26-10-2019T22:16:36,SpazztasticKiwi,anyone else see Wade Mark and Bob play that hunting the goatman game
26-10-2019T22:20:13,Ordithus,no not yet
26-10-2019T22:26:42,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s basically hunting bigfoot with a different monster
26-10-2019T22:26:54,SpazztasticKiwi,"in all, it’s pretty ok"
26-10-2019T22:27:48,SpazztasticKiwi,but goatman’s tracking is a little wonky and his roar sounds like someone pulled a bull’s tail
26-10-2019T22:28:07,SpazztasticKiwi,and Mark blew up a bear with a landmine
26-10-2019T22:28:33,Ordithus,Poor bear
26-10-2019T22:29:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"to his credit, it did work"
26-10-2019T22:30:50,SpazztasticKiwi,I liked the game - it’s a good simple like multiplayer you’d likely use more to mess with each other rather than kill the target but
26-10-2019T22:31:16,SpazztasticKiwi,far as I’ve seen that’s any multiplayer if you’re with friends
26-10-2019T22:32:36,Ordithus,Yeah.  Played Worms 3 player with my friends today.  Friend's wife was busy with the kid so we played for her.
26-10-2019T22:32:50,Ordithus,I destroyed myself :ptv-shock:
26-10-2019T22:34:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I remember when Seán played that with his editor once
26-10-2019T22:34:08,SpazztasticKiwi,blew himself up
26-10-2019T22:39:24,Ordithus,As happens
26-10-2019T22:40:34,Ordithus,Playing my own worms I'd miss everything.  Play hers and 100% devastation
26-10-2019T22:53:40,SpazztasticKiwi,half the time they play who can win the most rounds
26-10-2019T22:53:55,SpazztasticKiwi,the other half is “what does this thing do”
26-10-2019T22:55:30,AspiringNoodle,"Dang, chat is super active"
26-10-2019T22:55:35,RimaDraws,mhm
