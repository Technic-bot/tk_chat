24-09-2019T11:25:09,AspiringNoodle,That emote must get so much mileage
24-09-2019T11:37:36,ThingsAreMoving,Two things dragons are looking for: entertainment and power. Checks out.
24-09-2019T11:38:10,ThingsAreMoving,"The fact that Trace seems to be filthy rich doesn't hurt too, I assume."
24-09-2019T11:47:14,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-karenOOO:
24-09-2019T11:53:30,Twokinds,Money doesn't matter at all to a dragon
24-09-2019T11:53:34,TerraTheWizard,"enjoy the con, tom?"
24-09-2019T11:55:22,Twokinds,ye
24-09-2019T11:56:17,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
24-09-2019T11:58:49,ThingsAreMoving,"So, dragons in Twokinds don't hoard valuable stuffs?"
24-09-2019T12:05:13,iliar,I think this just doesn’t make sense. When you are a powerful dragon you can get things without money.
24-09-2019T12:05:47,Azumachan,:ctwokinds-florajiggle:
24-09-2019T12:06:28,iliar,You reminded me of one of my ideas. I wanted to suggest the idea of ​​human stereotypes about dragons. Something like that:
24-09-2019T12:06:33,iliar,"Nora found a new place for her cave.But after a while, she was disturbed by the villagers who brought the virgin as a sacrifice to the bloodthirsty dragon."
24-09-2019T12:06:39,iliar,Nora: Seriously? Virgin?! What will I do with her? Maybe at least gold or a cow?
24-09-2019T12:06:43,iliar,Shaman: No! Elder books say that exactly virgins must be sacrificed to dragons.
24-09-2019T12:06:45,iliar,Nora: Hey! I am dragon! I know better what will be better for me.
24-09-2019T12:10:48,Azumachan,What about shiny things ?
24-09-2019T12:11:31,ThingsAreMoving,"I guess, if there are spells and magics that allow item creation, then Dragons have no need for valuables."
24-09-2019T12:13:54,TerraTheWizard,turns out the real hoard was the dragons we befriended on the way
24-09-2019T12:13:56,TerraTheWizard,or something
24-09-2019T12:13:56,iliar,I think they can collect them ... as a hobby. https://cs11.pikabu.ru/post_img/big/2018/12/29/8/1546091995150821751.png
24-09-2019T12:14:10,iliar,"For example, Reni collects magical things."
24-09-2019T12:14:56,Azumachan,Nora's hobbies.
24-09-2019T12:19:32,ThingsAreMoving,I just imagined Nora having a cave full of replicas of interesting beings she has met during her lifetime.
24-09-2019T12:19:59,ThingsAreMoving,"Cave... that's a bit stereotypical. Lair, maybe."
24-09-2019T12:34:56,AspiringNoodle,"Narrator: ""Nora was able to acquire many things during her life.  However, there was one thing she wanted above all else, but could never have..."""
24-09-2019T12:35:19,AspiringNoodle,"Narrator: ""Trace Legacy's pants."""
24-09-2019T12:41:03,AspiringNoodle,...Is there a translation for that comic?
24-09-2019T12:57:39,ThingsAreMoving,Ask Illiar for a translation. Or try inputting that stuff manually into google translate
24-09-2019T13:00:16,Azumachan,It seem the speechless version is missing.
24-09-2019T13:06:31,Azumachan,Thank you :)
24-09-2019T13:13:25,AspiringNoodle,"Yay, successful google translate of first bubble"
24-09-2019T13:13:46,AspiringNoodle,"""Wow... I didn’t think you could have such a ...interesting... ...hobby ..."""
24-09-2019T13:22:58,iliar,Courier: Oh. I did not think that you have such... an interesting... hobby.
24-09-2019T13:23:03,iliar,Dragon: Don't blame me!
24-09-2019T13:23:09,iliar,Dragon: This is instinct. It is impossible to resist your nature.
24-09-2019T13:23:15,iliar,Dragon: And now put this limited edition figurine and don’t touch anything.
24-09-2019T13:23:31,AspiringNoodle,I was just about to post something similar :P
