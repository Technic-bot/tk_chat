18-01-2019T00:00:15,DesertFox,I dont mind it. I like getting peoples opinions.
18-01-2019T00:00:21,SageSaga,personally asking a single person or a couple is one thing- but - yeeeeah
18-01-2019T00:00:24,Bgrmystr2,"to be fair, that's pretty amazing, Muon. Something you'd never see normally."
18-01-2019T00:00:33,Nekonny,"Well, 12:00"
18-01-2019T00:00:42,Nekonny,time for me t o turn into a pumpkin
18-01-2019T00:00:49,SageSaga,its also how you end up with Boaty Mc Boatface
18-01-2019T00:00:50,unsteddyphoenix,"I mean, there's not much difference there sage"
18-01-2019T00:00:59,unsteddyphoenix,"Either you name it personally, or you ask people."

18-01-2019T00:01:15,unsteddyphoenix,"Nothing wrong with either method, imo"
18-01-2019T00:01:17,Mihari,"There is a difference between asking people, and random people."
18-01-2019T00:01:22,FoxxTrotter,"G'night, Ron. Thanks for the stream."
18-01-2019T00:01:38,Mihari,But I digress.

18-01-2019T00:01:43,SageSaga,i just personally believe thought and effort should be put into naming your characters
18-01-2019T00:01:44,unsteddyphoenix,I guess? I wouldnt call it much of a difference. Either way youre defering to others

18-01-2019T01:25:33,RimaDraws,idk we just have to find out
18-01-2019T01:25:42,MrEase,nah he became a eunich after his encounter with the king to stop people from finding out
18-01-2019T01:25:46,RimaDraws,i know ive read it but i hope he is
18-01-2019T01:25:46,Bgrmystr2,Tom's already said that it wasn't.
18-01-2019T01:25:48,Bgrmystr2,so I mean
18-01-2019T01:25:51,RimaDraws,well
18-01-2019T01:25:52,Bgrmystr2,it's fairly clear-cut
18-01-2019T01:25:55,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
18-01-2019T01:25:57,RimaDraws,can dream if i want to
18-01-2019T01:25:58,MrEase,"""whaaaat, thats not my kid, I can't have kids"" whistle"
18-01-2019T01:25:59,RimaDraws,so yea
18-01-2019T01:26:14,unsteddyphoenix,The country-wide bamboozle
18-01-2019T01:26:19,Bgrmystr2,"that's not how chances work, but okay"
18-01-2019T01:26:30,MrEase,Or it just stopped working after the king was done with him
18-01-2019T01:26:30,RimaDraws,its whateve
18-01-2019T01:26:38,MrEase,she snu-snu'd him too hard
18-01-2019T01:26:40,unsteddyphoenix,"The reality is Adelaide wanted a baby, so she made one through sheer force of will"
18-01-2019T01:26:42,RimaDraws,i am just stating my opinion
18-01-2019T01:27:35,RimaDraws,then again maybe this is a hallucination of shock and maybe one of the others will save them but who?
18-01-2019T01:27:38,Howlfeiwolf,"Hello yall,"
18-01-2019T01:27:53,unsteddyphoenix,Twist Euchre will save them
18-01-2019T01:27:59,RimaDraws,lol
18-01-2019T01:28:02,RimaDraws,fat chance
18-01-2019T01:28:08,CrimsonHelsing,Is anyone else getting a freeze frame on mobile instead of a live feed?
18-01-2019T01:29:19,RimaDraws,but i do love how this page is coming out especially with adelaide punching through that golem
18-01-2019T01:29:54,unsteddyphoenix,:punch::white_circle:
18-01-2019T01:29:56,RimaDraws,that is freaking bad ass
18-01-2019T01:30:18,unsteddyphoenix,Adelaides real punch would actually just blow it up
18-01-2019T01:30:29,RimaDraws,like a super saiyan yea lol
18-01-2019T01:30:31,RimaDraws,of course
18-01-2019T01:32:14,CrimsonHelsing,"Maddie, wipe your tears, and get up. You have an opening, take it. (Opening for what, though, idk)"
18-01-2019T01:32:26,RimaDraws,at least karen did something right for once
18-01-2019T01:32:29,RimaDraws,or tried to
18-01-2019T01:32:33,CrimsonHelsing,^
18-01-2019T01:32:43,CrimsonHelsing,Let's just hope it wasn't in vain
18-01-2019T01:32:45,unsteddyphoenix,She manged to dodge...somehow
18-01-2019T01:32:55,RimaDraws,well it was a lucky shot
18-01-2019T01:32:56,unsteddyphoenix,Maybe she accidentally fell over and got lucky
18-01-2019T01:33:01,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, I don't think karen's ever tried to do something wrong."
18-01-2019T01:33:07,CrimsonHelsing,She distracted the golem for another
18-01-2019T01:33:13,RimaDraws,no but she never was the smartest till now
18-01-2019T01:33:14,unsteddyphoenix,That does seem to be her fighting style: hit something and then fall down
18-01-2019T01:33:23,RimaDraws,i mean she told maddie to not open the door
18-01-2019T01:33:25,RimaDraws,what did she do
18-01-2019T01:35:24,RimaDraws,and part of me actually wants to believe her mom is there. but its a huge chance of her not being there
18-01-2019T01:36:37,MrEase,"Adelaide getting mixed in with the core cast would be fun, but remember the door curse"
18-01-2019T01:36:45,RimaDraws,yeaaaaa
18-01-2019T01:36:46,MrEase,she can't actually be here unless she's invited
18-01-2019T01:37:09,unsteddyphoenix,Basitins resist magic though
18-01-2019T01:37:12,RimaDraws,like i said we can dream lol
18-01-2019T01:37:19,unsteddyphoenix,And Adelaides like. The ultamite basitin
18-01-2019T01:37:25,MrEase,oh true
18-01-2019T01:37:35,RimaDraws,she a bad ass mama
18-01-2019T01:37:47,MrEase,but I dunno about Nora spells since Nora is almost god level
18-01-2019T01:38:27,Bgrmystr2,"yeah I'm sure nora's magic is strong enough to affect Adelaide, at least to some degree"
18-01-2019T01:38:32,unsteddyphoenix,True. Maybe dragon magic is different from basic bitch MORTAL magic
18-01-2019T01:38:45,Bgrmystr2,ya
18-01-2019T01:40:34,autoenigma,Basitin resist magic not unaffected by it
18-01-2019T01:41:09,Bgrmystr2,We're talking about Adelaide here lol
18-01-2019T01:41:14,Bgrmystr2,not just a normal basitin :P
18-01-2019T01:41:29,Twokinds,Basitin magic res increases with STR
18-01-2019T01:41:51,RimaDraws,id feel dumb for asking but what is STR?
18-01-2019T01:42:01,InTheLionsDen,Strength
18-01-2019T01:42:36,RimaDraws,ah thank you
18-01-2019T01:42:47,BluePhantom90,pulling a DBZ with Sayins almost near death get a power boost Tom?
18-01-2019T01:43:11,RimaDraws,adelaide = super mama
18-01-2019T01:43:25,Bgrmystr2,She is basically the hulk of all the basitins
18-01-2019T01:43:33,RimaDraws,she is the woman of all women
18-01-2019T01:43:45,RimaDraws,she wears her lady bits proudly
18-01-2019T01:44:18,BluePhantom90,OR a Amazon bastin from a unkown Island....
18-01-2019T01:45:14,RimaDraws,she is like the diana of the amazonians
18-01-2019T01:46:17,BluePhantom90,I have posted a sketch idea of her being from a Amazon Basitn's. r-r have the perfect set up too
18-01-2019T01:46:42,RimaDraws,maybe it will get it
18-01-2019T01:47:07,CrimsonHelsing,note to self: vote that idea if I see it
18-01-2019T01:47:08,RimaDraws,thats freaking cool tom
18-01-2019T01:48:07,unsteddyphoenix,Is it a flat number increase or a percentile increase?
18-01-2019T01:48:21,unsteddyphoenix,Could Adelaide reach 100% magic resist?
18-01-2019T01:48:21,RimaDraws,?
18-01-2019T01:48:28,RimaDraws,oh
18-01-2019T01:48:47,CrimsonHelsing,"who knows, yo"
18-01-2019T01:49:01,Twokinds,Adelaide can resist almost all magic.
18-01-2019T01:49:08,CrimsonHelsing,almost
18-01-2019T01:49:17,unsteddyphoenix,So like. 99%
18-01-2019T01:49:27,RimaDraws,that 1%
18-01-2019T01:49:35,Twokinds,It doesn't stop a nonmagic rock from being thrown by magic.
18-01-2019T01:50:49,Twokinds,"And it doesn't stop the effects of direct magic usage, like the damage happens to all Basitins that try to use magic."
18-01-2019T01:50:49,CrimsonHelsing,"well it's still a golem, really"
18-01-2019T01:51:15,Twokinds,"Anyway, done!"
18-01-2019T01:51:18,unsteddyphoenix,But being turned into a chicken
18-01-2019T01:51:24,unsteddyphoenix,Would be resisted I assume
18-01-2019T01:51:32,unsteddyphoenix,Like how Keith resisted being pranked
18-01-2019T01:51:38,CrimsonHelsing,"whoa man, can't wait to read this"
18-01-2019T01:51:39,RimaDraws,so glad i got to catch the  end of this instead of dozing off this time
18-01-2019T01:51:41,unsteddyphoenix,"Also, nice job!"
18-01-2019T01:51:42,Twokinds,"Yeah, Adelaide probably doesn't have to worry about being turned into a chicken."
18-01-2019T01:51:45,Bgrmystr2,"Nicely done, Tom"
18-01-2019T01:51:59,MrEase,thats good
18-01-2019T01:52:00,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Very well done Tom

18-01-2019T01:54:44,Twokinds,I wasn't listening to it

18-01-2019T01:56:54,unsteddyphoenix,Huh.
18-01-2019T01:57:00,unsteddyphoenix,Did you listen to it at 2x speed?
18-01-2019T01:57:00,RimaDraws,oh nice
18-01-2019T01:57:05,RimaDraws,that sounds interesting
18-01-2019T01:57:06,Twokinds,lol
18-01-2019T01:57:09,unsteddyphoenix,That should be a requirement
18-01-2019T01:57:16,Bgrmystr2,xD
18-01-2019T01:57:32,unsteddyphoenix,What type of tips did it give? :thinking:
18-01-2019T01:57:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Learn by experience
18-01-2019T01:58:02,Twokinds,Most of it was pretty basic stuff.
18-01-2019T01:58:14,SpazztasticKiwi,The faster you play this audio book and still follow along the better
18-01-2019T01:58:21,Twokinds,"Setting up a place to work uninterrupted, writing things quickly without editing."
18-01-2019T01:58:31,Twokinds,I haven't finished it yet.
18-01-2019T01:59:15,RimaDraws,i have watched marie kondo on organizing your home and finding joy in it.
18-01-2019T01:59:29,unsteddyphoenix,Hmm I see
18-01-2019T01:59:45,RimaDraws,whats the book called?
18-01-2019T01:59:45,unsteddyphoenix,Sounds kinda interesting. I wanna get back into writing...
18-01-2019T02:01:36,unsteddyphoenix,I wonder if it has the big tips near the end
18-01-2019T02:02:38,Twokinds,I don't want to recommend anything as I haven't finished any of them
18-01-2019T02:03:13,RimaDraws,well when you do let us know
18-01-2019T02:03:39,Twokinds,"But one is ""2k to 10k"" and the other is ""5000 words per hour""."
18-01-2019T02:04:15,Twokinds,There's another one I think W0lf would like.
18-01-2019T02:04:37,unsteddyphoenix,Is it one with no nudity?

18-01-2019T10:59:15,CrimsonQuill,:ctwokinds-lynnsmile::ptv-greetings:
18-01-2019T10:59:49,CrRAR,Good mooorrning~
18-01-2019T11:00:03,CrimsonQuill,Good Afternoon
18-01-2019T11:00:13,CrimsonQuill,:ctwokinds-wink:
18-01-2019T11:00:27,CrRAR,"Good EVERYTHING, everyone!"
18-01-2019T11:00:44,CrimsonQuill,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
18-01-2019T11:00:57,CrimsonQuill,I feel accomplished.
18-01-2019T11:01:04,CrRAR,\o/
18-01-2019T11:01:12,Xexanoth,Good Daycycle!
18-01-2019T11:01:23,CrimsonQuill,I'm FINALLY drawing in and colouring that Subnautica fanart I've been nattering about.
18-01-2019T11:01:27,CrimsonQuill,o/ Xexanoth
18-01-2019T11:35:52,Twokinds,I always imagine Flora as a Mesmer
18-01-2019T11:36:50,CrimsonQuill,A Mesmer?
18-01-2019T11:37:11,CrimsonQuill,"""It is your primary objective to swim closer to that BEAUTIFUL CREATURE...."""
18-01-2019T11:37:42,CrimsonQuill,"Why a mesmer, Tom?"
18-01-2019T11:38:32,Twokinds,Cause it'd be Trace swiming
18-01-2019T11:38:43,CrimsonQuill,Oh crumbs.
18-01-2019T11:38:53,CrimsonQuill,"Well, she's a lot nicer than a mesmer anyhow..."
18-01-2019T11:39:00,CrimsonQuill,OH! Have to ask this...
18-01-2019T11:39:11,CrimsonQuill,What colour would your Seamoth be?
18-01-2019T11:39:24,CrimsonQuill,Because I have to colour it in.
18-01-2019T11:39:41,CrimsonQuill,I know Mark's PRAWN suit is yellow and Sean's Sally the Seamoth is green...
18-01-2019T11:39:51,CrimsonQuill,I just don't have a colour for your Seamoth.
18-01-2019T11:39:51,Twokinds,I made mine orange-yellow. Just cause that's the easiest color to see from a distance.
18-01-2019T11:40:02,CrimsonQuill,Ok. orange-yellow it is.
18-01-2019T11:40:03,CrimsonQuill,Thanks.
18-01-2019T11:40:21,Twokinds,"Plus, you know, the song"
18-01-2019T11:40:53,CrimsonQuill,Makes sense.
18-01-2019T11:41:00,CrimsonQuill,:ctwokinds-rainehappy:
18-01-2019T11:41:27,CrimsonQuill,"I'm just glad that the exams are over. I've been going about this for two months, it's about time I actually drew it."
18-01-2019T11:43:28,CrimsonQuill,"Also, reading your recent strip on the site, I'm rather worried about Maddy and Karen."
18-01-2019T11:44:44,CrimsonQuill,"Given that that lizard statue caught her in the stomach with a flying sideways kick and smashed her into the wall hard enough for blood from the mouth, things look frighteningly deadly."
18-01-2019T11:45:03,CrimsonQuill,The suspense is killing me...
18-01-2019T11:45:38,CrimsonQuill,I'm trying to anticipate what'll happen next...
18-01-2019T11:46:00,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-natsducky:
18-01-2019T11:46:11,CrimsonQuill,:ctwokinds-rainehappy:
18-01-2019T11:46:20,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-rose:
18-01-2019T11:55:22,CrimsonQuill,I love these emotes.
18-01-2019T11:56:17,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-keith8D:
18-01-2019T11:56:19,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-florajiggle:
18-01-2019T12:00:11,NibblyBot,New Patreon Post: Booby McFoxFace https://www.patreon.com/posts/booby-mcfoxface-24000610
18-01-2019T12:00:53,TerraTheWizard,"lol, that title"
18-01-2019T12:01:00,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-clovisgirl_shake:
18-01-2019T12:01:20,Twokinds,Oh right I forgot that was going up today
18-01-2019T12:01:21,Twokinds,lol
18-01-2019T12:01:41,iliar,"To be honest, I don’t understand why this suggestion was chosen."
18-01-2019T12:03:11,iliar,I mean it already was in TDM. I would prefer something new.
18-01-2019T12:04:21,Twokinds,People sometimes want to see things remade in more detail.
18-01-2019T12:05:03,CrimsonQuill,"You hit the nail dead centre with the hammer, Tom."
18-01-2019T12:05:12,CrimsonQuill,That being said...
18-01-2019T12:05:28,Azumachan,Howdy
18-01-2019T12:05:41,CrimsonQuill,Hullo Azuma. :ctwokinds-wink::ptv-greetings::ctwokinds-rainehappy:
18-01-2019T12:05:57,Xexanoth,wasn't this one of the tom picks anyways?
18-01-2019T12:06:00,Xexanoth,so...
18-01-2019T12:06:01,Azumachan,:ctwokinds-florajiggle:
18-01-2019T12:06:04,Xexanoth,no blaming the audience
18-01-2019T12:06:26,CrimsonQuill,To be honest what I am most concerned about is a cup of tea.
18-01-2019T12:06:27,Xexanoth,then again last sunday was pretty fanservice heavy
18-01-2019T12:06:40,CrimsonQuill,:ctwokinds-kingtea:
18-01-2019T12:06:50,CrimsonQuill,I'm going to have some Earl Greay.
18-01-2019T12:06:50,Twokinds,oh no what a nightmare
18-01-2019T12:06:52,TerraTheWizard,"thought that was a new suggestors name, turns out they'd had one before"
18-01-2019T12:07:02,CrimsonQuill,I'll be back soon.
18-01-2019T12:07:05,TerraTheWizard,so still 1 person until 200 patrons credited for suggestions
18-01-2019T12:07:20,Twokinds,lol really?
18-01-2019T12:07:22,Twokinds,200
18-01-2019T12:07:41,Twokinds,In that case it won't be this week
18-01-2019T12:07:56,Twokinds,I believe the next two are from people who have already had suggestions in the past too
18-01-2019T12:08:18,TerraTheWizard,"though technically we're at like 203 ish, because people changed their usernames"
18-01-2019T12:10:05,iliar,"I understand when people ask for a rework on the comic page. For example, the kiss of Trace and Flora looks good, because there is a big difference between the old version and the new one."
18-01-2019T12:10:10,iliar,"But in this case, I do not see much difference."
18-01-2019T12:10:34,Azumachan,^
18-01-2019T12:10:46,TerraTheWizard,"boobs go bwom, butts go bwob :ctwokinds-clovisgirl_shake:"
18-01-2019T12:11:38,Xexanoth,"eh,i prefer cute/funny or jsut cool stuff ofer blatant fanservice..."
18-01-2019T12:12:09,TerraTheWizard,the thing about fanservice is that fans want it
18-01-2019T12:12:12,TerraTheWizard,lol
18-01-2019T12:12:49,TerraTheWizard,the game is to word a fun suggestion in such a way to trick the silent majority that it's fanservice :ctwokinds-wink:
18-01-2019T12:12:58,iliar,"And about suggestion. Tom, can you make more time to voting? Now that there are more suggestion, it is sometimes difficult to even read all. Maybe start a vote while you're still drawing."
18-01-2019T12:13:14,Azumachan,That's true.
18-01-2019T12:13:44,Twokinds,I'll consider it
18-01-2019T12:18:58,iliar,"And yes, the last time I sent a proposal, I did not specially not specify what form I was talking about. I expected that when people read ""Nora posing for Eric's portrait"" they will imagine she in human form."
18-01-2019T12:19:14,iliar,The trap failed.
18-01-2019T12:19:18,Twokinds,Oh
18-01-2019T12:19:30,CrRAR,lol
18-01-2019T12:19:32,Twokinds,I clarified because I didn't want it to be ambiguous
18-01-2019T12:19:48,iliar,I understood.
18-01-2019T12:19:58,iliar,And it is right.
18-01-2019T12:20:06,Twokinds,"I've had people try to write their suggestions one way, then try to secretly get me to draw something else instead."
18-01-2019T12:21:28,iliar,"Well ... technically the dragon form is the main form. Therefore, when there is no clarification, it is logical to expect exactly this form."
18-01-2019T12:21:36,Twokinds,lol
18-01-2019T12:21:40,Twokinds,Sure
18-01-2019T12:23:36,iliar,And agree reference was good.  https://yadi.sk/i/XLi2xiPXNCWw8w
18-01-2019T12:23:52,Twokinds,Yes I like the art a lot
18-01-2019T12:23:59,Twokinds,I like dragons doing normal things.
18-01-2019T12:25:46,Azumachan,Nora Ceo of Tom's pizza.
18-01-2019T12:26:33,iliar,"I like it better when there is a combination of animal instincts and human traits in art. Like this ""Dragon collects princesses"" https://pikabu.ru/story/quotkhobbiquot_6389831"
18-01-2019T12:27:19,Twokinds,Heh
18-01-2019T12:27:29,Twokinds,Sure
18-01-2019T12:27:32,iliar,The author of this comic book is Russian. And I'm not sure what it translates. But I think even without translation it is obvious what is happening here.
18-01-2019T12:28:09,CrimsonQuill,@Iliar I know what you mean by suggestion confusion.
18-01-2019T12:29:38,CrimsonQuill,"@Twokinds, sorry"
18-01-2019T12:30:03,CrimsonQuill,So people say one thing in the suggestion and then ask for something else...
18-01-2019T12:30:28,CrimsonQuill,Interesting.
18-01-2019T12:30:30,Twokinds,Just a few people try to work around the system
18-01-2019T12:30:50,Twokinds,"Put suggestion worded carefully in quotes, then below it clarify they want something else"
18-01-2019T12:30:58,Twokinds,I don't accept them.
18-01-2019T12:31:40,CrimsonQuill,"I remember when you were drawing Halo Raine, my suggestion said ""Human""...but as you were drawing her at all, I remember I didn't mind whether she was human, Keidran or both..."
18-01-2019T12:31:45,CrimsonQuill,I hope that doesn't count though.
18-01-2019T12:32:17,CrimsonQuill,"I can understand why you wouldn't accept them, anyhow."
18-01-2019T12:32:25,CrimsonQuill,"Very counterintuituve, and rather sly."
18-01-2019T12:32:47,CrimsonQuill,"Sorry, I mucked up the spelling again, that should be 'counter-intuitive'."
18-01-2019T12:40:02,iliar,"I agree with you. When people vote, they want to see what they voted for."
18-01-2019T12:40:11,RimaDraws,hii
18-01-2019T12:40:12,iliar,"The only reason why I didn't clarify about ""dragon form"" is ""dragon is main form""."
18-01-2019T12:40:14,CrimsonQuill,Hullo Rima
18-01-2019T12:40:31,RimaDraws,i just woke back up
18-01-2019T12:41:12,CrimsonQuill,I try to jam as much into as few words as possible.
18-01-2019T12:41:48,CrimsonQuill,"For example, my current suggestion reads, 'Trace being chased by a Reaper Leviathan in a Seamoth' for my Subnautica thing."
18-01-2019T12:42:11,CrimsonQuill,I think this'll be the last time I try it for a while.
18-01-2019T12:42:29,CrimsonQuill,"I need to vary my suggestions, as opposed to hoping that one will win for months,,,"
18-01-2019T12:42:43,CrimsonQuill,:ctwokinds-soon:
18-01-2019T12:44:11,RimaDraws,lol
18-01-2019T12:45:30,RimaDraws,i still have my same suggestion. i wanna keep trying.
18-01-2019T12:46:18,RimaDraws,i know what ill do for my next tk fanart: maddie and maeve. something cute with them
18-01-2019T12:47:27,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-florajiggle:
18-01-2019T12:48:19,RimaDraws,maybe maeve getting a piggy back ride or them playing a game the other likes
18-01-2019T12:48:34,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-maddiessparkles:
18-01-2019T12:49:20,RimaDraws,and if its the one of her getting a piggy back ride with maddie she might have her tail in her mouth
18-01-2019T12:49:25,CrimsonQuill,"I don't really draw TK fanart, or look at it..."
18-01-2019T12:49:46,CrimsonQuill,"Number one, I'm afraid that I might ruin the characters with my lousy skills."
18-01-2019T12:49:53,RimaDraws,nah
18-01-2019T12:49:56,CrimsonQuill,"Number two, I stick to Tom's stuff"
18-01-2019T12:50:21,RimaDraws,no one ruins anything with your own skills. you make your own art special with practice.
18-01-2019T12:50:27,CrimsonQuill,"Besides, I've already got a few of my own things coming from my sleeve."
18-01-2019T12:50:46,CrimsonQuill,I should be on my sister's levels in about 2-3 years...
18-01-2019T12:50:50,RimaDraws,i do these for practice or i do them for fun
18-01-2019T12:51:22,CrimsonQuill,"I've set up a Deviantart Schedule where I'm going to put up one new colour drawing a week, starting tomorrow."
18-01-2019T12:51:28,RimaDraws,this is just my way to show appreciation and my love for the fandom
18-01-2019T12:51:31,CrimsonQuill,I consider Sunday to be the start of the week.
18-01-2019T12:51:42,CrimsonQuill,I hope that I'll improve as I go.
18-01-2019T12:51:48,RimaDraws,you should
18-01-2019T12:51:56,RimaDraws,i know you can
18-01-2019T12:52:01,TerraTheWizard,"don't worry about lousy skills, i mean, look what i drew yesterday https://www.deviantart.com/terrathewizard/art/Raine-finds-a-Lightsaber-781642322"
18-01-2019T12:52:06,RimaDraws,everyone improves at their own pace quill.
18-01-2019T12:52:13,RimaDraws,even i am not quite there yet
18-01-2019T12:52:40,TerraTheWizard,"the ""not quite there yet"" feeling never gos away"
18-01-2019T12:52:44,TerraTheWizard,*goes
18-01-2019T12:52:49,TerraTheWizard,or so i'm told
18-01-2019T12:52:51,CrimsonQuill,@TerratheWizard just a very quick peek
18-01-2019T12:53:01,RimaDraws,i faved terra
18-01-2019T12:53:04,RimaDraws,and watched
18-01-2019T12:53:07,CrimsonQuill,I don't look at fanart really
18-01-2019T12:53:09,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
18-01-2019T12:53:14,CrimsonQuill,But I see what you mean.
18-01-2019T12:53:40,CrimsonQuill,"Well, i have got fanart of HoSalmanstra's Kessah as a Spartan 4..."
18-01-2019T12:53:46,CrimsonQuill,But that's Kessah.
18-01-2019T12:53:57,CrimsonQuill,I think it's the best drawing I've done yet.
18-01-2019T12:54:05,CrimsonQuill,And I'll improve.
18-01-2019T12:54:13,CrimsonQuill,I'm putting it on my DA tomorrow.
18-01-2019T12:54:59,TerraTheWizard,nice
18-01-2019T12:55:29,TerraTheWizard,i've had an oddly productive week creative-wise
18-01-2019T12:55:33,RimaDraws,link me yours ?
18-01-2019T12:55:39,CrimsonQuill,Maybe...
18-01-2019T12:55:47,CrimsonQuill,"I'm afraid to, because it has my actual name"
18-01-2019T12:56:00,CrimsonQuill,And I'm very paranoid about net secutiry
18-01-2019T12:56:02,CrimsonQuill,security
18-01-2019T12:56:16,RimaDraws,okay whatever floats your boat. im not gonna steal your name. just wanna see the art. but ok wont ask again
18-01-2019T12:56:41,TerraTheWizard,wrote 6 episodes of a story i'm adding to
18-01-2019T12:56:45,CrimsonQuill,I'll link it after a few bits here and there
18-01-2019T12:56:48,TerraTheWizard,and re-started on my art learning
18-01-2019T12:57:50,RimaDraws,i need to start some studies

18-01-2019T13:05:49,CrimsonQuill,I am going to ask one question...
18-01-2019T13:05:52,CrimsonQuill,And that is....
18-01-2019T13:06:02,CrimsonQuill,What do you think of the ducks and cat?
18-01-2019T13:06:20,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-maddiessparkles:
18-01-2019T13:06:40,CrimsonQuill,I'll take that as a positive answer.
18-01-2019T13:07:03,RimaDraws,i like the cat and ducks
18-01-2019T13:07:09,RimaDraws,also like some of the traditional art
18-01-2019T13:07:11,CrimsonQuill,@RimaDraws Oh. You've added me to the watch list?
18-01-2019T13:07:33,CrimsonQuill,:ptv-scratch::ctwokinds-keithdotdotdot::ctwokinds-rainehappy: Thanks!
18-01-2019T13:10:20,RimaDraws,why?
18-01-2019T13:10:34,RimaDraws,i dont care about names i just like art
18-01-2019T13:10:54,CrimsonQuill,Just thanks.
18-01-2019T13:10:58,RimaDraws,ok
18-01-2019T13:11:07,CrimsonQuill,I can at least promise that there will be something tomorrow...
18-01-2019T13:11:11,CrimsonQuill,"two things, in fact."
18-01-2019T13:11:13,RimaDraws,by the way neat model for the picture
18-01-2019T13:11:29,CrimsonQuill,Thanks.
18-01-2019T13:11:37,CrimsonQuill,I built it for a deviant friend.
18-01-2019T13:11:53,CrimsonQuill,They were one of the very first deviants I commented on.
18-01-2019T13:12:12,CrimsonQuill,Now we talk about lego on videochats.
18-01-2019T13:12:17,CrimsonQuill,And it only took 6 years...
18-01-2019T13:13:57,RimaDraws,oh cool
18-01-2019T13:14:48,CrimsonQuill,Just watching a Markiplier Subnautica vid and I realise I've got the colours on his PRAWN suit wrong....

18-01-2019T13:16:16,RimaDraws,it happens

18-01-2019T16:28:44,SageSaga,that's what that noise they make though is -
18-01-2019T16:28:49,Bgrmystr2,it goes 'jiiii~'
18-01-2019T16:28:52,SageSaga,yep
18-01-2019T16:29:15,CrimsonQuill,It's really cool.
18-01-2019T16:29:25,Bgrmystr2,"staring itself doesn't make ANY sounds, obviously, but it's japan, so they have a sound effect for everything"
18-01-2019T16:29:46,CrimsonQuill,I saw on the news though that Japan has restarted Commercial Whaling.
18-01-2019T16:29:48,CrimsonQuill,Not so good.
18-01-2019T16:30:01,AshtonFinel,Hi
18-01-2019T16:30:12,CrimsonQuill,hullo
18-01-2019T16:30:56,SageSaga,No one said Japan was perfect
18-01-2019T16:31:12,CrimsonQuill,No country's perfect.
18-01-2019T16:31:14,SageSaga,in fact they are probably one of the most racist and fastest dying countries in the world
18-01-2019T16:31:30,CrimsonQuill,Oh. Kay.
18-01-2019T16:31:35,CrimsonQuill,Umm...
18-01-2019T16:31:41,Bgrmystr2,"yknow sage, you can always go with the 'creeak' and 'slide' or somethin. Door sounds are easy, but I don't know the sound effects for dead bodies, like crumple sure.. but that's not really sliding across the floor"
18-01-2019T16:31:54,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
18-01-2019T16:32:46,CrimsonQuill,I came up with a word for someone being gored and smashed at the same time.
18-01-2019T16:32:57,CrimsonQuill,*SPLAMTCH*
18-01-2019T16:33:07,CrimsonQuill,I think it suits the situation pretty well.
18-01-2019T16:33:31,SageSaga,"little off topic- but have ya ever played DnD where the rogue is like ""I bought oil to put on the hinges so I wanna do that before opening the door, also i want to use my mirror under the door to check for anything first"" and thought-"
18-01-2019T16:33:38,SageSaga,"""This person has robbed a real home"""
18-01-2019T16:34:05,CrimsonQuill,"Sadly, I have not had the pleasure of playing D and D... *sob*"
18-01-2019T16:34:10,Bgrmystr2,xD sage
18-01-2019T16:34:19,Bgrmystr2,"not really, but I can understand"
18-01-2019T16:34:32,sunblaze,well no sage usally they just lockpick and slaughter unawared
18-01-2019T16:34:38,sunblaze,but yeah sounds about legit :D
18-01-2019T16:34:42,AshtonFinel,I've never played D&D.
18-01-2019T16:35:44,CrimsonQuill,"Given Kaylin's level, those bandits have even less chance than with Nyna."
18-01-2019T16:36:00,CrimsonQuill,"That face says simply, ""OMAE WA MOU SHINDERU""."
18-01-2019T16:36:01,sunblaze,the mobs yeah
18-01-2019T16:36:07,ghostXotaku7,yoyo:ptv-victory:
18-01-2019T16:36:12,CrimsonQuill,'ullo
18-01-2019T16:36:18,sunblaze,maybe the boss will prove to be somehow able
18-01-2019T16:36:34,CrimsonQuill,Define 'somehow'.
18-01-2019T16:36:52,sunblaze,I mean the game has challenging enemies for level 100 PC's so somewhere some should exist
18-01-2019T16:37:03,sunblaze,but yeah probably not in a bandits stronghold
18-01-2019T16:37:39,CrimsonQuill,"That being said, bandits can be tough..."
18-01-2019T16:37:51,sunblaze,somehow = dodge the first strike and life til the second
18-01-2019T16:37:56,CrimsonQuill,"If you're still levelling, and you have a habit of charging headfirst into battle."
18-01-2019T16:37:59,CrimsonQuill,Like me.
18-01-2019T16:38:02,CrimsonQuill,"No strategy,"
18-01-2019T16:38:08,CrimsonQuill,It's my Achilles heel.
18-01-2019T16:38:22,sunblaze,she is a rogue
18-01-2019T16:38:22,CrimsonQuill,I never really come up with a strategy to beat them.
18-01-2019T16:38:37,sunblaze,she has to ahve a strategy for everything. otherwise she'd be looong dead
18-01-2019T16:38:38,CrimsonQuill,It's woefully inefficient.
18-01-2019T16:39:14,CrimsonQuill,How many times in Skyrim have I died due to my own incompetance? Too many
18-01-2019T16:39:38,CrimsonQuill,"Well, looks like I need to head for the nigh."
18-01-2019T16:39:41,CrimsonQuill,night.
18-01-2019T16:39:46,sunblaze,missing that one arrow and getting donked by undead in a burrow where you forgot to switch to melee :D
18-01-2019T16:39:49,sunblaze,yeah I know that
18-01-2019T16:39:53,CrimsonQuill,Yah
