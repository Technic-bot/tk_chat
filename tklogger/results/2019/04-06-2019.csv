04-06-2019T00:02:25,AspiringNoodle,"Thinking back, there were so many shows as a kid that should've been straight nightmare fuel, but ran for multiple seasons.  Anyone else feel the same?"
04-06-2019T00:02:41,RimaDraws,ren and stimpy
04-06-2019T00:03:02,AspiringNoodle,Catdog had a few episodes
04-06-2019T00:03:13,RimaDraws,oh yea
04-06-2019T00:03:15,AspiringNoodle,Courage the Cowardly Dog is THE show that should've been straight nightmare fuel but wasn't
04-06-2019T00:04:49,AspiringNoodle,"I mean... seriously, where do I begin with that one?"
04-06-2019T00:05:01,RimaDraws,too many to choose
04-06-2019T00:05:11,AspiringNoodle,Several off the top of my head
04-06-2019T00:06:01,AspiringNoodle,King Ramses.  The curse where they had to grow SOMETHING on the farm.
04-06-2019T00:06:59,AspiringNoodle,"Oh jeeze, the rest blur together into a haze ranging from slightly disturbing to nightmare made real."
04-06-2019T00:07:23,AspiringNoodle,I think there was the one where the computer became mobile...
04-06-2019T00:10:36,SpazztasticKiwi,if you want nightmare fuel watch Thing in the Apartment
04-06-2019T00:11:16,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s only a few short minutes
04-06-2019T00:11:49,AspiringNoodle,You ever watch the short film that lead to Lights Out?
04-06-2019T00:11:59,AspiringNoodle,THAT'S some next-level horror
04-06-2019T00:12:19,AspiringNoodle,"Also, golden rule of horror: Big budget = shitty film <3"
04-06-2019T00:19:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom was here but he left
04-06-2019T00:20:03,AspiringNoodle,"Oh no, did we give him flashbacks?"
04-06-2019T00:20:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Like he woke up and oops - bedtime again
04-06-2019T00:23:55,AspiringNoodle,"Speaking of nightmares and sleep, looks like The Thing is about to start on Syfy"
04-06-2019T00:24:34,AspiringNoodle,"Hmmmm, no nightmares and sleep, or nightmares and no sleep.... I choose the latter <3"
04-06-2019T00:26:51,Dadrobit,\o/  Residents brought a gift basket o' goodies to my gate! I guess I'm having a cheat day...
04-06-2019T00:34:02,AspiringNoodle,AWWWWWWWWWWWWW
04-06-2019T00:34:16,AspiringNoodle,It's the somewhat crappy prequel and not the 1980's original :(
04-06-2019T00:37:49,SpazztasticKiwi,the conversation was on ghosts and creepy and you happily pop in some “residents” brought food
04-06-2019T00:38:08,SpazztasticKiwi,as long as they weren’t see through it’s safe
04-06-2019T00:39:14,AspiringNoodle,xD
04-06-2019T00:39:36,AspiringNoodle,"Well, found The Thing in the Apartment, they even made a new video a year later that's 2-for-1!"
04-06-2019T00:39:47,AspiringNoodle,Watch now or later... tough call...
04-06-2019T00:41:24,AspiringNoodle,"Oh geeze, checking youtube for one last time tonight, and now I'm getting all these horror shorts recommendations.  WIN."
04-06-2019T00:46:41,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-sleepy:
04-06-2019T00:49:07,Dadrobit,"Naw, these residents are legit. Just brought a big torso sized gift basket of cookies and baked treats."
04-06-2019T00:52:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Jesus
04-06-2019T00:52:39,SpazztasticKiwi,They ARE trying to kill you
04-06-2019T00:57:39,Dadrobit,"They didn't actually bring me a torso, just a basket big enough to held a toddler or so."
04-06-2019T00:57:54,Dadrobit,Hold*
04-06-2019T00:58:17,SpazztasticKiwi,fattening you up for dinner
04-06-2019T00:59:25,Dadrobit,"Eh, I have only had one cookie, gonna save the rest and role them out to the other guards working this area tonight."
04-06-2019T00:59:43,Dadrobit,dole*
04-06-2019T01:03:26,Dadrobit,Got a new phone and it seems like it's helping with my previously terrible internet connection.
04-06-2019T01:04:33,Dadrobit,"Not fantastic by any means, still only 2-3 bars of 4G, but it's not cutting out or dropping quality every 2 minutes, so that's cool."
04-06-2019T01:18:20,SpazztasticKiwi,🛌
04-06-2019T01:19:50,Dadrobit,Night
04-06-2019T01:25:35,SpazztasticKiwi,before bed video. Just watched a guy try parkour and he got a tree up his chimney
04-06-2019T01:27:30,Dadrobit,"At first I thought you were being literal. Like, parkour is cool and all, but this dude straight up turned into the Grinch Midway and started kidnapping trees through chimneys."
04-06-2019T01:27:40,SpazztasticKiwi,a moment of silence for him but I sorta hope it rendered him infertile
04-06-2019T01:28:40,SpazztasticKiwi,You know it hurt when they curl into a ball of silence like a scared hedgehog
04-06-2019T01:38:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Ok bed now
04-06-2019T01:42:17,Dadrobit,Have a good night

04-06-2019T14:05:53,TerraTheWizard,story wrap up
04-06-2019T14:07:45,Orthonox,What a fun ride this story was. Now we can reread it again.

04-06-2019T14:08:20,BadFoMo,"So, what's the next one going to be about?"
04-06-2019T14:09:34,TerraTheWizard,now that's the million dollar question
04-06-2019T14:10:43,TerraTheWizard,there were these 2 pages from way back in 2012 that might be a clue
04-06-2019T14:10:51,TerraTheWizard,if that story had anything written of it

04-06-2019T20:39:13,AspiringNoodle,That's awful D:
04-06-2019T20:39:38,AspiringNoodle,"Awful joke aside, how as your day?"
04-06-2019T20:43:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Hiddleston was originally trying for Thor. Thank chaos he became Loki
04-06-2019T20:43:09,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-clovischuckle:
04-06-2019T20:43:24,AspiringNoodle,Uh... yeah...
04-06-2019T20:43:40,AspiringNoodle,We needed a literal god to play Thor.  Thank Odin it was Chris Hemsworth <3
04-06-2019T20:50:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Hiddleston’s god enough
04-06-2019T20:50:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Prettier than Hemsworth
04-06-2019T20:58:42,SpazztasticKiwi,And I learned he’s like 6”2
04-06-2019T20:58:58,SpazztasticKiwi,frost giant
04-06-2019T21:02:18,AspiringNoodle,I can't stop thinking about that movie.
04-06-2019T21:02:30,AspiringNoodle,"It's a shameless tearjerker, but oh man is it effective ;_;"
04-06-2019T21:02:57,AspiringNoodle,Not even the idea of a bulge editor (as hilarious as it is) can prymy thoughts away.
04-06-2019T21:11:20,SpazztasticKiwi,lé junk wrangler
04-06-2019T21:12:48,SpazztasticKiwi,I like the trivia - like Tom said he and Chris would go see showings of the movies together and they’d get little kids tugging on their parents like “dad...Loki and Thor are here”
04-06-2019T21:18:56,AspiringNoodle,"In Soviet Russia, soup eat spoon."
04-06-2019T21:19:17,AspiringNoodle,"Also, that sounds awesome"
04-06-2019T21:19:28,AspiringNoodle,"And yes, my soup did eat my spoon."
04-06-2019T21:35:10,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d try a female Loki look. Got the eyes. Just not the costume
04-06-2019T21:48:20,AspiringNoodle,"Hey, you ever watch CinemaSins?"

04-06-2019T22:11:05,Dadrobit,"Right-o, heading on in for work."
