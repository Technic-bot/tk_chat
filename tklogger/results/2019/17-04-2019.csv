17-04-2019T07:50:43,FloofyCat,"I know there's still a day till the next stream, but does anyone know which chapters Tom still considers canon and stuff?"
17-04-2019T07:56:27,FloofyCat,"And are all the sketches considered non-canon? I know the stuff like Laura and Keith, meeting characters like Magpie, Clovis meeting everyone, the vixen club etc are non-canon, but is some of the stuff like Kat x Natani sparring considered canon?"
17-04-2019T07:58:33,FloofyCat,Or are all the sketches kinda just automatically considered non-canon? Sorry if this question has been asked a thousand times already.
17-04-2019T09:42:57,BadFoMo,"I think all the chapters are canon? As for the sketches, They're mostly non-canon but I think there are a few that are canon."
17-04-2019T09:44:55,BadFoMo,...Or at least 'B-Canon' (canon until something in the comic says otherwise).
17-04-2019T09:45:42,TerraTheWizard,^^
17-04-2019T10:56:55,Dadrobit,"Yeah, everything in-comic is still canon. Rarely (though it does happen) if Tom decides to change things canonically, he goes back and just changes it."

17-04-2019T12:06:08,iliar,I wonder if it really in the US  does turn off the electricity when it rains?
17-04-2019T12:12:24,Azumachan,If you have exposed lines it's a good idea.
17-04-2019T12:31:05,Twokinds,lol not usually no
17-04-2019T12:31:32,Twokinds,"Though where I live, it feels like we get a power outtage way more than everyone else."
17-04-2019T12:31:40,SpazztasticKiwi,We don‚Äôt have to turn off the power when the rain does it for us
17-04-2019T12:31:52,Twokinds,I think I lost power 6 times last year.
17-04-2019T12:31:59,SpazztasticKiwi,‚Äúhehehehe. Lights off!‚Äù
17-04-2019T12:32:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Normally what happens for us is a tree hits a line or pole
17-04-2019T12:33:35,SpazztasticKiwi,One time during some regular calm rain the tv wouldn‚Äôt act right and my sister was trying to watch a show
17-04-2019T12:34:14,SpazztasticKiwi,our mom went out and looked at the dish and a tiny little lizard was sitting on the antenna. blocking the signal
17-04-2019T12:34:53,iliar,"Hm In my childhood, we also turned off the electricity during a thunderstorm (not just rain). But I thought this problem has been solved."
17-04-2019T12:35:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Power went off at work once when lightning struck the building power box outside. It exploded apparently
17-04-2019T12:37:31,Twokinds,"I have a old house, before standards."
17-04-2019T12:37:42,Twokinds,It doesn't have ground wires in most outlets.
17-04-2019T12:37:49,Twokinds,So it's a little dangerous.
17-04-2019T12:38:01,iliar,"In our country house the last time electricity was turned off a few years ago, when the wires broke during while Ice pellets."
17-04-2019T12:38:17,SpazztasticKiwi,home alone pre-rigged light switches. Great
17-04-2019T12:42:48,iliar,About lightning. I used to enjoy trying to make a photo of a lightning. Like this https://pp.userapi.com/c626521/v626521913/19a2b/zl3doO7_Bf0.jpg

17-04-2019T12:58:48,SpazztasticKiwi,thesaurus.com May help better at times
17-04-2019T13:12:10,TorqueEmUp,"Yeah, the house I grew up in didn't have grounds on most of the outlets either. House was built in the 50s"
17-04-2019T13:19:30,Twokinds,Yeah it means honest and sincere.
17-04-2019T13:21:27,iliar,And what about wistful
17-04-2019T13:23:40,Azumachan,"synonyms: regretful, nostalgic, yearning, longing"

17-04-2019T13:24:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Or daydreamy

17-04-2019T16:29:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I grabbed some sprigs of the azalea bush from our old house plot
17-04-2019T16:30:17,SpazztasticKiwi,she planted em there after she got married and the bush is too big and over grown to replant now
17-04-2019T16:30:36,SpazztasticKiwi,But the bits I got hopefully will re root to new bushes

17-04-2019T17:59:57,SpazztasticKiwi,I know just bits and pieces on computers but anyone wanna tell me why my keyboard is trying to up and escape https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/524825976597643265/568571230337105930/image0.jpg
17-04-2019T18:00:43,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
17-04-2019T18:01:03,Bgrmystr2,does it.. not push back in?
17-04-2019T18:02:00,SpazztasticKiwi,My luck I‚Äôd try it and break it
17-04-2019T18:02:07,SpazztasticKiwi,But I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs all it needs
17-04-2019T18:02:22,SpazztasticKiwi,I mean it still works and all
17-04-2019T18:03:26,Bgrmystr2,"I wouldn't say water damage, though that's usually how a lot of things warp"
17-04-2019T18:03:37,Bgrmystr2,"but that's probably heat of some type, if I had to guess"
17-04-2019T18:03:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Nothings spilled on it recently
17-04-2019T18:04:03,SpazztasticKiwi,It stays in its sleeve unless I‚Äôm on it
17-04-2019T18:04:10,BadFoMo,Maybe heat warpped it?
17-04-2019T18:04:12,Bgrmystr2,"it may have been dropped, but if so, it may have had issues with the hard drive if it's disk drive"
17-04-2019T18:04:44,Bgrmystr2,but yeah it's most likely heat
17-04-2019T18:05:07,SpazztasticKiwi,My only guess is yesterday it was bumped moving stuff around
17-04-2019T18:05:17,Bgrmystr2,do you know what kind of drive is inside? :o
17-04-2019T18:05:21,SpazztasticKiwi,and just needs to be popped back in
17-04-2019T18:05:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Uh
17-04-2019T18:05:44,SpazztasticKiwi,stats I can see says 500 gb hard drive
17-04-2019T18:06:00,Bgrmystr2,yeah but is it a disk drive or solid state? :o
17-04-2019T18:06:15,SpazztasticKiwi,No earthly clue
17-04-2019T18:06:45,Bgrmystr2,"SSDs are usually noted on it, and don't have moving parts, so they won't be damaged so easily by movement or drops"
17-04-2019T18:06:54,Bgrmystr2,or any kind of physical trauma
17-04-2019T18:07:22,Bgrmystr2,hm

17-04-2019T18:07:39,Bgrmystr2,oh nope XD
17-04-2019T18:07:44,Bgrmystr2,I have nothing like that
17-04-2019T18:08:55,SpazztasticKiwi,"if this makes any sense, this is what my phone scanned http://scn.by/9t9ab0htw8k6xw"
17-04-2019T18:10:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve used that reader maybe twice
17-04-2019T18:10:22,Bgrmystr2,it says 5400rpm
17-04-2019T18:10:27,Bgrmystr2,which means it's a hard disk drive
17-04-2019T18:10:44,Bgrmystr2,so it's highly unlikely that the keyboard was damaged from hitting something
17-04-2019T18:10:53,Bgrmystr2,"cuz that would have affected the hard drive too, most likely"
17-04-2019T18:10:58,SpazztasticKiwi,nothing else is wrong. The keyboards just trying to up and run
17-04-2019T18:11:15,SpazztasticKiwi,"far as I‚Äôve found, it‚Äôs booting and running fine"

17-04-2019T18:25:45,SpazztasticKiwi,and I never showed this car if you can call it that
17-04-2019T18:26:07,SpazztasticKiwi,I saw it in the parking lot at work awiiile ago https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/524825976597643265/568577808876437524/image0.jpg

17-04-2019T18:27:50,Bgrmystr2,This is what you're looking at by the way https://slingshot.polaris.com/en-us/
17-04-2019T18:28:19,Bgrmystr2,it's a 3-wheeled vehicle kinda like a cross between a bike and a car
17-04-2019T18:28:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Ah yes
17-04-2019T18:28:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Because that‚Äôs practical around here
17-04-2019T18:29:00,Bgrmystr2,haha
17-04-2019T18:29:12,SpazztasticKiwi,I remember looking at it and brain trying to find out what exactly I was seeing
17-04-2019T18:29:25,Bgrmystr2,well now you know
17-04-2019T18:29:43,Bgrmystr2,it's just a 3 wheeled roadster
17-04-2019T18:29:54,SpazztasticKiwi,only question I had was where‚Äôs the other wheel
17-04-2019T18:29:54,Bgrmystr2,"it's a bit exotic in design, but other than that"
17-04-2019T18:30:02,Bgrmystr2,"two front, one in the back haha"
17-04-2019T18:30:13,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve also seen a limo at work so
17-04-2019T18:30:31,SpazztasticKiwi,even the parking lot is a trip
17-04-2019T18:30:43,Bgrmystr2,that is pretty awesome though
17-04-2019T18:31:26,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve got other pictures of that slingshot

17-04-2019T18:53:19,RimaDraws,thats  a little high on a car
17-04-2019T19:16:57,SpazztasticKiwi,That‚Äôs what I was on about. Lady got a brand spankin new 2018/19 or something car and dumped her old one at her mothers
17-04-2019T19:17:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"this old one still runs well but it‚Äôs got those miles, a dead battery from being still so long, and tired that may could use replacement"
17-04-2019T19:17:53,SpazztasticKiwi,and a bath inside and out
17-04-2019T19:18:55,SpazztasticKiwi,"there‚Äôs a dealer selling a Jeep I like but it‚Äôs got 212,221 on it"

17-04-2019T21:20:32,CrRAR,Oh oh that's milage xD
17-04-2019T21:21:00,CrRAR,I though you were saying a pricing typo. Holy crap that's a lot of miles.
17-04-2019T21:29:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Exactly
17-04-2019T21:30:02,SpazztasticKiwi,And they‚Äôre asking 8000

17-04-2019T21:41:02,Dadrobit,They're out of their mind. $8k for 200k+ miles on a 16+ year old vehicle?
17-04-2019T21:41:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Yep
17-04-2019T21:42:11,SpazztasticKiwi,That‚Äôs what it says
17-04-2019T21:42:12,Dadrobit,"Wrangler, Liberty, or Cherokee?"

17-04-2019T21:49:56,Dadrobit,"Yeah, KBB'd it just now. Even if it was in ""Excellent"" condition (which it isn't) it still wouldn't even be worth more than $7200."
17-04-2019T21:50:08,CrRAR,That... I feel like still should be like a few thousand cheaper than it is.
17-04-2019T21:50:16,Dadrobit,"Sorry, Excellent condition, and with half the milage."
17-04-2019T21:50:26,CrRAR,lol
17-04-2019T21:51:03,CrRAR,Maybe... 5000 even wouldn't be bad.
17-04-2019T21:51:18,SpazztasticKiwi,How bad is an older model chevy malibu with 17500ish
17-04-2019T21:52:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Cause this lady wanted to know if I‚Äôd take it since her daughter got a new car and abandoned the old
17-04-2019T21:52:28,CrRAR,175000mi?
17-04-2019T21:52:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I didn‚Äôt like it a whole lot
17-04-2019T21:52:39,SpazztasticKiwi,About that they said
17-04-2019T21:52:52,SpazztasticKiwi,‚Äú125000 or 175000‚Äù
17-04-2019T21:53:08,SpazztasticKiwi,But the battery‚Äôs dead from sitting so long so
17-04-2019T21:53:16,CrRAR,I know some old Taureses ran to 300000 miles they were troopers.
17-04-2019T21:53:29,CrRAR,Sitting a long time is bad too.
17-04-2019T21:53:30,SpazztasticKiwi,The tires looked like they needed changed
17-04-2019T21:53:43,CrRAR,Yeah tires will dry rot
17-04-2019T21:53:48,Bgrmystr2,my question would be.. how do you search for a vehicle on KBB if it's older than their search options
17-04-2019T21:53:50,CrRAR,Things rust
17-04-2019T21:54:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Not dry rot but thin
17-04-2019T21:54:09,CrRAR,I.... Didn't know that was possible robit.
17-04-2019T21:54:38,SpazztasticKiwi,"the tread‚Äôs thin, that is"
17-04-2019T21:54:40,CrRAR,Just gotta worry about if it'll pass inspection for emissions and whatever.
17-04-2019T21:54:55,Dadrobit,"""Robit""?"
17-04-2019T21:55:07,CrRAR,Lots of high mileage cars have CELs and whatnot
17-04-2019T21:55:14,CrRAR,Daddy?

17-04-2019T21:56:18,SpazztasticKiwi,The meet I did have at that dealership was interesting
17-04-2019T21:56:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Took me three or four times saying no to that car they offered before he took it as an answer
17-04-2019T21:57:24,Bgrmystr2,"Well, I didn't say whether anything was possible or not, I simply asked a question, so I'm not sure how it'd apply to what I asked xD"
17-04-2019T21:57:36,CrRAR,Salesfolk be like that.
17-04-2019T21:57:38,Dadrobit,"Mid-Town is fleecing people, checked out the Eddie Bauer. KBB lists them at half their price."
17-04-2019T21:57:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Looking more on that jeep though I‚Äôm gonna maybe try another car
17-04-2019T21:58:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Color and size it what caught me driving by
17-04-2019T21:58:24,Dadrobit,"I'd be willing to bet they ""allow"" themselves to be ""talked down"" a few grand on their vehicles to let hte buyers feel like they get a deal."
17-04-2019T21:58:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"Dude did tell me he‚Äôd got from 5,500 to just 5,000"

17-04-2019T21:59:01,SpazztasticKiwi,How dumb do I look?
17-04-2019T21:59:02,CrRAR,"Yeah, never trust the staff, do research, drive a car, if anything feels off and the price is redic, RUN!"
17-04-2019T22:00:00,SpazztasticKiwi,"Each car does come with a lifetime mechanical thing. If it breaks, they‚Äôll fix whatever it is"
17-04-2019T22:00:17,CrRAR,That's why the prices are elevated.
17-04-2019T22:00:27,CrRAR,I've heard of those.
17-04-2019T22:00:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"But thing is when they fix up a car to actually sell they change tires, oil, parts, whatever all new"
17-04-2019T22:00:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Even detail some
17-04-2019T22:01:27,CrRAR,"Yeah, just comes to their discretion to do what needs doing."
17-04-2019T22:01:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"But that guy was trying to get me on an suv, when I said first thing that I was looking for something small, or truck"
17-04-2019T22:01:55,SpazztasticKiwi,‚Äúsimple‚Äù truck at that
17-04-2019T22:02:24,Bgrmystr2,yeah they don't listen to you
17-04-2019T22:02:26,CrRAR,"Yeah, they'll try steering you all different ways."
17-04-2019T22:02:37,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-natanispincycle:
17-04-2019T22:02:57,SpazztasticKiwi,"I mean I drove the thing, the suv, but I heard something that sounded between rattle-y and thunk-y"
17-04-2019T22:03:12,Bgrmystr2,"they don't talk to you, they talk at you, that's how they sell things. Push what they want to sell to you and completely ignore anything the buyer wants.. makes you feel like you don't have any options."
17-04-2019T22:03:19,SpazztasticKiwi,And I didn‚Äôt want the thing to begin with
17-04-2019T22:03:42,CrRAR,Some thanks - after hitting bumps - can be the sway bar linkages.
17-04-2019T22:04:01,CrRAR,*thunks
17-04-2019T22:04:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I didn‚Äôt find it normal
17-04-2019T22:04:22,SpazztasticKiwi,So pass
17-04-2019T22:04:38,Bgrmystr2,thunks and rattles are not normal.
17-04-2019T22:05:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Dude watched me look at the malibu they had and you should‚Äôve seen his face when I mentioned the tinting in the windows
17-04-2019T22:05:19,CrRAR,Yeah it sounds scary. Swaybar links wear out normally... It's not a mechanical threat. But if that's not what was thinking it could be something worse.
17-04-2019T22:05:32,CrRAR,*thunking
17-04-2019T22:05:51,CrRAR,Stupid autocorrect.
17-04-2019T22:06:11,Bgrmystr2,turn it off so it can stop trying to think for you :V
17-04-2019T22:06:16,CrRAR,xD
17-04-2019T22:06:20,SpazztasticKiwi,I liked it but wasn‚Äôt too fond of the heavy tint and I mentioned I knew there was a limit on the tint
17-04-2019T22:06:32,CrRAR,Mmm
17-04-2019T22:06:54,SpazztasticKiwi,he gave me a ‚Äúyes there very true‚Äù like it was some off the charts fact
17-04-2019T22:07:09,SpazztasticKiwi,"It‚Äôs a legal thing. To be a driver, you should know"
17-04-2019T22:07:47,CrRAR,Yeah past a certain point it's a legal issue. We're the front two windows tinted dark?
17-04-2019T22:07:59,CrRAR,*Were
17-04-2019T22:08:01,SpazztasticKiwi,All four were
17-04-2019T22:08:13,SpazztasticKiwi,But the front was less than the back
17-04-2019T22:08:20,Bgrmystr2,"the only window that can't be tinted at all is the front windshield. Even the front side windows can be tinted, but not as much as the back can."
17-04-2019T22:08:29,CrRAR,"Yeah front two here in my state past 35 are ""illegal"""
17-04-2019T22:08:47,CrRAR,Though if it's factory smoked glass might be okay.
17-04-2019T22:09:02,Bgrmystr2,"As far as I know, the amount of tint differs from state to state"
17-04-2019T22:09:26,CrRAR,"Anything ""factory"" regardless is legal, but usually never aftermarket or front at all."
17-04-2019T22:09:36,CrRAR,Oh yeah
17-04-2019T22:09:59,CrRAR,Florida and Hawaii are the lowest obvs lol
17-04-2019T22:10:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve been told it‚Äôs a good idea to take a mechanic friend when car looking
17-04-2019T22:10:07,CrRAR,Indeed
17-04-2019T22:10:33,SpazztasticKiwi,If I could drag one along I would but only when I find a definite one I want to further check out
17-04-2019T22:11:00,CrRAR,"Test drive... Listen for noises, check steering wheel for straightness (alignment issue)."
17-04-2019T22:11:12,CrRAR,Check tire wear before
17-04-2019T22:11:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve also been told it can benefit me if I just bring a guy
17-04-2019T22:11:32,CrRAR,If tires worn uneven that is also alignment
17-04-2019T22:11:45,CrRAR,...and possibly connective joints
17-04-2019T22:11:59,CrRAR,Tie rods/control arm issues.
17-04-2019T22:12:06,CrRAR,Yeah lol
17-04-2019T22:12:41,CrRAR,Braking too if there's vibration when stopping or weird noise that's trouble
17-04-2019T22:13:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"My main thing is watching the lights all come on when you crank it. If the check engine doesn‚Äôt at least flash, they‚Äôve disabled the warning lights"
17-04-2019T22:14:04,SpazztasticKiwi,As I‚Äôve been told anyway
17-04-2019T22:14:08,CrRAR,Exactly! Just typing that lol Also any weird lights on dash.
17-04-2019T22:14:23,CrRAR,"If it looks like a Christmas tree, run!"
17-04-2019T22:15:15,CrRAR,"Yeah, shopping for a car especially in that range is tough."
17-04-2019T22:15:22,SpazztasticKiwi,No smoke is best smoke
17-04-2019T22:15:31,CrRAR,lol
17-04-2019T22:16:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Which reminds me I believe Mark said he got ‚Äúthe barrel‚Äù fixed
17-04-2019T22:17:06,CrRAR,"Ooo, ominous~"
17-04-2019T22:18:38,SpazztasticKiwi,The barrel is what he calls his GMC van
17-04-2019T23:05:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera keeps falling off the bed now there‚Äôs no side rail
