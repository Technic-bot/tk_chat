16-05-2019T05:51:37,CrimsonQuill,"Job done, walk away!"
16-05-2019T05:51:47,CrimsonQuill,Just two more Hells to go through...
16-05-2019T07:13:28,TerraTheWizard,mmmmm
16-05-2019T07:13:35,TerraTheWizard,went out for 2.5 hours
16-05-2019T07:13:43,TerraTheWizard,set a thing to download while i was out
16-05-2019T07:13:58,TerraTheWizard,and my internet went off about 30 mins after i left
16-05-2019T07:19:21,CrimsonQuill,That burns.
16-05-2019T07:33:43,TerraTheWizard,well it's going again
16-05-2019T07:33:54,TerraTheWizard,fingers crossed it doesn't get timed out like usual

16-05-2019T07:34:28,TerraTheWizard,>gets timedout anyway

16-05-2019T09:33:34,Mippy,My province is trying to make people go back to church by bombing our YouTube videos with ‚ÄúWhy go to church?‚Äù Commercials. I guess that‚Äôs what I get for living in Canada‚Äôs Bible Belt
16-05-2019T09:35:07,CrimsonQuill,Hi Mippy
16-05-2019T09:35:15,CrimsonQuill,"Also, weird"
16-05-2019T09:35:24,CrimsonQuill,I just go to Mass because I like going to Mass
16-05-2019T09:35:49,CrimsonQuill,"I never thought that a religion needed to say, why go to mass on youtube."
16-05-2019T09:37:34,Mippy,"Well, I suppose it‚Äôs because they need new members to keep going. The religious population is ageing and more and more young people are non religious."
16-05-2019T09:38:15,CrimsonQuill,I can see that.
16-05-2019T09:53:12,AspiringNoodle,"Well, non-religious or choosing a new religion ;)"
16-05-2019T09:53:29,AspiringNoodle,Buddhism seems fun.
16-05-2019T09:55:36,TerraTheWizard,or that one type of satanism
16-05-2019T09:55:44,TerraTheWizard,that's just christianity but without god
16-05-2019T09:55:46,CrimsonQuill,Hullo Terra

16-05-2019T09:56:11,TerraTheWizard,because there's the one where they actually worship satan
16-05-2019T09:57:20,TerraTheWizard,myup
16-05-2019T09:57:31,CrimsonQuill,RIP Grumpy Cat.
16-05-2019T10:00:01,TerraTheWizard,the problem with this downloader is it doesn't have a date parameter that's useful for a set range
16-05-2019T10:00:10,TerraTheWizard,so i have to wait for it to scan back to where it left off
16-05-2019T10:00:17,TerraTheWizard,it's back there now
16-05-2019T10:00:23,TerraTheWizard,but that took like 2 hours
16-05-2019T10:00:33,CrimsonQuill,Woah.
16-05-2019T10:01:19,TerraTheWizard,it's on file 950k of like 1.8M

16-05-2019T15:33:47,CrimsonQuill,@SpazztasticKiwi do ou know the horror of a chronic Skyrim addiction during Exam time?
16-05-2019T15:34:02,SpazztasticKiwi,"Ah yes. Because when the fries all the hairs off you, it means she loves you. Who needs waxing"
16-05-2019T15:34:17,CrimsonQuill,Or a chronic Skyrim Addiction full stop?
16-05-2019T15:34:28,CrimsonQuill,Please Help Me. I can't stop playing it.
16-05-2019T15:35:06,TerraTheWizard,i almost failed my gcse's because of minecraft addiction
16-05-2019T15:35:17,TerraTheWizard,or was that a levels
16-05-2019T15:35:22,TerraTheWizard,i can't remember school
16-05-2019T15:35:38,TerraTheWizard,time is too fast and history is compressing
16-05-2019T15:35:46,CrimsonQuill,GCSE's are before A and O levels.
16-05-2019T15:35:48,CrimsonQuill,I know that.
16-05-2019T15:36:00,TerraTheWizard,o levels haven't existed since like the 90s
16-05-2019T15:36:18,Mippy,It‚Äôs all Greek to me
16-05-2019T15:36:34,CrimsonQuill,XD Mippy
16-05-2019T15:36:34,tehbear,is it o as in 0 level? the first level?
16-05-2019T15:36:46,TerraTheWizard,no
16-05-2019T15:36:48,CrimsonQuill,"""There is now...a level zero."""
16-05-2019T15:36:53,TerraTheWizard,i have no idea what it stands for
16-05-2019T15:37:01,TerraTheWizard,or a levels for that fact
16-05-2019T15:37:10,TerraTheWizard,because they have a different official name
16-05-2019T15:37:14,Mippy,Zero level...isn‚Äôt that Kindergarten?
16-05-2019T15:37:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Nah headstart
16-05-2019T15:37:46,TerraTheWizard,though technicaly they all have different name levels
16-05-2019T15:37:54,TerraTheWizard,why is the whole system so complicated
16-05-2019T15:37:57,CrimsonQuill,"It's where Po the Panda starts out before he becomes badass and where Church, Grif and Simmons were swarmed by Covenant in RvB"
16-05-2019T15:38:18,Mippy,Head start? Makes me think of those Jumpstart games...
16-05-2019T15:38:43,TerraTheWizard,gcse (general certificate of secondary education(high school)) is L2
16-05-2019T15:39:22,TerraTheWizard,A-levels (sometimes GCE) is L3
16-05-2019T15:39:40,Mippy,"Oh, level 2 is high school. So level Zero is elementary?"
16-05-2019T15:39:41,TerraTheWizard,L4 is college stuff like HND/HNC
16-05-2019T15:39:51,TerraTheWizard,L% is degree
16-05-2019T15:39:54,TerraTheWizard,*L5
16-05-2019T15:39:55,TerraTheWizard,lol

16-05-2019T15:42:23,Mippy,Why don‚Äôt you Britastic people just go with the undifficult North American system?
16-05-2019T15:42:39,Mippy,Art @tehbear
16-05-2019T15:43:09,CrimsonQuill,Because we're not American.
16-05-2019T15:43:26,CrimsonQuill,And we don't live there.
16-05-2019T15:43:34,Mippy,I said Noth American...not American
16-05-2019T15:43:40,Mippy,Also...joke
16-05-2019T15:43:47,SpazztasticKiwi,headstart was basically babysitting
16-05-2019T15:44:06,SpazztasticKiwi,it was school but it was learning activities without grades
16-05-2019T15:44:19,CrimsonQuill,"American can mean North and South American, Mippy"
16-05-2019T15:44:25,Mippy,Oh...so like cram school
16-05-2019T15:44:27,TerraTheWizard,ehhh
16-05-2019T15:44:31,SpazztasticKiwi,"How you learned the abcs & 123s, colors and shapes"
16-05-2019T15:45:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Since I have an older sister I was picking stuff up from her grade so I started headstart with a good understanding of what I was doing
16-05-2019T15:45:37,SpazztasticKiwi,I got a head start on headstart

16-05-2019T15:45:52,tehbear,A student at level 0
16-05-2019T15:46:01,Mippy,"Yes Quill, but unless you specify, most people think of  USA when you say America. Calling two whole continents American/America just is confusing"
16-05-2019T15:47:19,Mippy,"Please specify, it‚Äôs kind of like calling Irish people British"
16-05-2019T15:47:51,tehbear,"dont people usually say Americas, emphasis on the s"
16-05-2019T15:48:00,tehbear,if they want to include n and s
16-05-2019T15:48:04,CrimsonQuill,I see.
16-05-2019T15:48:10,CrimsonQuill,Confusing.
16-05-2019T15:48:21,tehbear,*the americas
16-05-2019T15:48:28,CrimsonQuill,"Then again, if you called me Irish or British, neither'd be truly wrong."
16-05-2019T15:48:36,CrimsonQuill,I'm half and half anyhow!
16-05-2019T15:48:37,CrimsonQuill,:)
16-05-2019T15:48:44,CrimsonQuill,But I understand the point.

16-05-2019T15:57:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh and out of pure morbid curiosity I checked out the gender flip filter. I look like Tyler
16-05-2019T15:57:17,CrimsonQuill,Whut
16-05-2019T15:57:26,CrimsonQuill,"A ""Gender flip filter""?"
16-05-2019T15:57:48,tehbear,probably instagram ?
16-05-2019T16:00:08,TerraTheWizard,snapchat
16-05-2019T16:00:34,TerraTheWizard,they have the genderswap filter from faceapp
16-05-2019T16:00:38,TerraTheWizard,but it works in realtime
16-05-2019T16:01:17,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs been made into a bigger thing than it should be
16-05-2019T16:01:26,SpazztasticKiwi,But it‚Äôs work time. Out at 9
16-05-2019T16:01:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Hopefully
16-05-2019T16:01:34,tehbear,does it use the 3d scan functionality of the iphone x?

16-05-2019T16:04:17,TerraTheWizard,the limiting factor in a lot of our portable tech now is batteries
16-05-2019T16:04:28,TerraTheWizard,soon as we sort that out we're set for a tech boom
16-05-2019T16:05:07,TerraTheWizard,90% of a phone by mass is dedicated to the battery
16-05-2019T16:05:38,TerraTheWizard,and like 60%+ of the volume
16-05-2019T16:08:28,AspiringNoodle,"What we really need is to move away from Lithium ion batteries.  They are a god send, but holy do they use rare materials."

16-05-2019T16:24:10,TerraTheWizard,don't think so
16-05-2019T16:24:44,tehbear,i think its limited to Flora forgetting to retract her claws when pouncing Trace
16-05-2019T16:25:08,CrimsonQuill,"To be honest, I think it's best we gloss over those things."

16-05-2019T19:26:08,Dadrobit,That was a test to see what the general masses would have voted for vs what the Patrons would vote for.
16-05-2019T19:26:28,Dadrobit,General masses picked 6/7 ref sheets.
16-05-2019T19:26:37,Dadrobit,"Or something like that, maybe 5/7"
16-05-2019T19:26:43,Bgrmystr2,it was 5/7
16-05-2019T19:26:57,Bgrmystr2,And it was pick 7 because there's 7 images per stream
16-05-2019T19:27:04,Bgrmystr2,so no you're not gonna get more than that.

16-05-2019T19:53:14,AspiringNoodle,"And ofc the processed, unhealthy foods are so much cheaper than the healthier alternatives :("
16-05-2019T19:57:46,SpazztasticKiwi,I almost bought tickets and was going to try scheduling a vacay at that GotoPivip thing. But figured nah

16-05-2019T20:16:15,Nekonny,"I hate it when I'm looking for a file, and I can't remember where it is"
16-05-2019T20:16:20,AspiringNoodle,Man... I cannot start re-reading webcomics fast enough.
16-05-2019T20:16:26,Nekonny,it  seems to be happening more and more often with me
16-05-2019T20:16:30,AspiringNoodle,I remember when Mora was a lot less busty xD
16-05-2019T20:16:37,Chalodraws,BRB!
16-05-2019T20:16:41,Pltnm06Ghost,I've been dead all day in bed since my body could hardly move from working out the other day.
16-05-2019T20:16:55,Chalodraws,"Yeah, i remember too. when I was still learning to draw"
16-05-2019T20:16:55,Nekonny,"doesnt help that I'm split between 3 computers, several portable storage devices and dropbox"
16-05-2019T20:17:15,Pltnm06Ghost,I'm starting to wake up later and later thanks to the all nighter streams I've been pulling XD
16-05-2019T20:17:47,AspiringNoodle,I think that's the charm of long-running webcomics.  You can watch the artist evolve from their early endeavors to their practiced craft.
16-05-2019T20:19:40,Nekonny,Ok then!
16-05-2019T20:19:58,Nekonny,I'm going to kick off tonights first raffle drawing

16-05-2019T20:20:17,Pltnm06Ghost,It's like reading a manga that's been going on since the 80's. Art style changes over time.
16-05-2019T20:20:28,Nekonny,this is for an oc sketch using the maid uniform shown on my stream
16-05-2019T20:20:55,Strawbetch,There's three...?

16-05-2019T20:40:46,Mihari,"The only thing in the negative was if you win, no it can't be a bikini, it will be a predetermined out which that was specified at the start."
16-05-2019T20:40:53,Strawbetch,I have enough problems with medical bills as is.

16-05-2019T21:05:06,RandomTonio,MS Paint > Photoshop
16-05-2019T21:05:26,Strawbetch,"Seems to be the truth nowadays, yikes."

16-05-2019T21:06:51,AspiringNoodle,"I more or less want a program with a devoted drawing area.  Tried Sketchbook Pro, didn't like the free-floating UI"
16-05-2019T21:07:03,Mippy,Hmmm...Looks like Tom is not in this episode and tonights guest star is Chalo
16-05-2019T21:07:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi mippy

16-05-2019T21:08:08,Twokinds,I dont know he said hes only here for tomorrow. I dont think so unless i have to take him back to the airport.
16-05-2019T21:08:41,SageSaga,Surely he can get an Uber or have one of his friend take him :P
16-05-2019T21:09:11,Plaga,how is it going lmao

16-05-2019T21:09:25,SageSaga,XD I dont want to miss 2 weeks of the game in a row since next week Silver and Fluff arent able ot make it

16-05-2019T21:09:51,Plaga,"hope everything is going good on your end , mihari !"
16-05-2019T21:09:58,SageSaga,it was just a joke Plaga that we had been talking about earlier :P

16-05-2019T21:10:42,Mihari,"No no offense, as for going good, not for the past 2 years XD"
16-05-2019T21:10:59,SageSaga,i think we all agree that you cant be mad if someone misgenders you when they cant know your gender- and anyone who misgenders someone on purpose is just a dick anyways
16-05-2019T21:11:21,happyguyone,I'm surprised that mora didn't think of the hard cider idea sooner.
16-05-2019T21:11:28,Mippy,OMG! Mihari! You were great in Hunters of Kilamanjaro!

16-05-2019T21:17:33,Nekonny,"does a john Henry, pulling out second pen to attack this drawing"
16-05-2019T21:17:46,SageSaga,how does one get Chalo's attention
16-05-2019T21:17:52,Nekonny,"wait, doesnt he die at the end?"
16-05-2019T21:17:55,Chalodraws,:cchalodraws-MoraPicarto_Lewd:
16-05-2019T21:17:56,Mihari,Yes
16-05-2019T21:18:05,Tharkis,I almost picked that up at PAX East
16-05-2019T21:18:15,SageSaga,Chalo- are those rings on those for support or just for looks?
16-05-2019T21:18:21,Tharkis,but my friends i'd play it with had already played through it
16-05-2019T21:18:23,Tharkis,=(
16-05-2019T21:18:24,Chalodraws,Ill say both.
16-05-2019T21:18:34,happyguyone,John Henry ?
16-05-2019T21:18:37,SageSaga,ok then you want a bit of random knowledge?
16-05-2019T21:18:40,Nekonny,SO what will it be Mihari? ^^
16-05-2019T21:18:43,Chalodraws,Sure
16-05-2019T21:18:45,Strawbetch,"Betrayal House on the Hill, huh?"
16-05-2019T21:18:46,Mihari,Ummm...
16-05-2019T21:18:48,Strawbetch,What's that like?
16-05-2019T21:19:05,SageSaga,Rings added to support things that hold lots of fluid do not evenly space the rings- they add more the lower because of the higher presures
16-05-2019T21:19:37,Chalodraws,My reply to that would be...
16-05-2019T21:19:38,MarvTheHugPharaoh,going sailing Ron?
16-05-2019T21:19:40,Chalodraws,Space Dragons
16-05-2019T21:20:14,SageSaga,. . .
16-05-2019T21:20:21,Tharkis,"so i still havent played betrayal house on the hill, since we ended up getting a new game none of them had played before instead >_<"
16-05-2019T21:20:33,RandomTonio,What if Mihari doesn‚Äôt want it?
16-05-2019T21:20:34,Chalodraws,Just my excuse when I dont know what Im doing. lol
16-05-2019T21:20:39,Twokinds,Id enjoy playing more tabletop games.
16-05-2019T21:20:42,Strawbetch,Is it like an actual game on Steam or sometihng?
16-05-2019T21:20:42,Tharkis,"(Azul , was pretty ok)"
16-05-2019T21:20:51,Nekonny,me tooo
16-05-2019T21:20:58,Tharkis,betrayal at house on the hill is a very famous recent avalon hill game
16-05-2019T21:21:13,Tharkis,like 15 years old
16-05-2019T21:21:32,Tharkis,"there's a D&D version, and a sequal that just came out, and 2 expansions?"
16-05-2019T21:21:36,Tharkis,sequel
16-05-2019T21:21:36,SageSaga,it's just about adding an extra bit of detail
16-05-2019T21:21:55,Strawbetch,"Ohhh, tabletop."
16-05-2019T21:21:56,SageSaga,its also super easy to do
16-05-2019T21:22:02,Strawbetch,Never really got into those.
16-05-2019T21:22:11,Strawbetch,I guess they sound kinda neat tho.
16-05-2019T21:22:12,SageSaga,Betrayal is not recent XD
16-05-2019T21:22:31,Strawbetch,"Yeah, 15 years seems pretty old, m8/"
16-05-2019T21:22:39,Tharkis,15 years old is recent in terms of avalon hill games !
16-05-2019T21:23:04,Tharkis,"games like diplomacy, axis and allies, panzerblitz and whatnot are all from the 70s!"
16-05-2019T21:23:44,Mippy,Cool...Might read the wikipedea to find out more.
16-05-2019T21:25:15,Mippy,Might just get into reading game mauals....it's hard to play when  your friends all live in a different provinvnce
16-05-2019T21:26:22,DonotaroAfterDark,@Nekonny Just joined.
16-05-2019T21:27:07,SageSaga,"its like - 15 years ago and I still make the joke with my local friends - ""No, i want ALL the turns!"" which is a betrayal reference i hope some of you get :P"

16-05-2019T21:35:54,SageSaga,oh crap - i gotta figure out how to sell them online. .. . Mi-MIHARI!
16-05-2019T21:36:35,LunarSpy,"Okay, I have to ask, what program are you to using for your characters there?"
16-05-2019T21:36:40,LunarSpy,I want one for my Panda!
16-05-2019T21:37:10,Nekonny,Gumroad sage
16-05-2019T21:37:39,SageSaga,how does that work Ron?
16-05-2019T21:37:46,Mippy,I look forward to it Sage
16-05-2019T21:37:56,Nekonny,it's an online store system
16-05-2019T21:38:07,Mihari,Well the thing about Gumroad is they take percent don't they?
16-05-2019T21:38:12,Nekonny,you can offer up several things for sale there
16-05-2019T21:38:31,Nekonny,or you could see if mihari can set you up with a direct to paypal payment system
16-05-2019T21:38:45,Nekonny,doesnt everyone though?
16-05-2019T21:38:57,Mihari,Not if you do it yourself?
16-05-2019T21:39:35,Mihari,Not like I take any kickbacks XZD
16-05-2019T21:41:12,AspiringNoodle,Question for all artists:  How overrated is photoshop?
16-05-2019T21:41:18,BadFoMo,Back.
16-05-2019T21:41:23,AspiringNoodle,Welcome back :)
16-05-2019T21:41:46,SageSaga,"Photoshop is not overrated, it's just more than what most illustrators need"
16-05-2019T21:42:10,Nekonny,(kinda like clip)
16-05-2019T21:42:17,Strawbetch,Personally? Super overrated.
16-05-2019T21:42:20,AspiringNoodle,Lolwut
16-05-2019T21:42:33,Mihari,It's pricepoint is overratted
16-05-2019T21:42:56,Strawbetch,I work just fine with GIMP and I don't even main GIMP.
16-05-2019T21:43:12,happyguyone,@AspiringNoodle very overrated and I'm not an artist
16-05-2019T21:43:13,SageSaga,i tihnk it's price is fair if you are using everything it can do all the time :P
16-05-2019T21:43:17,Tharkis,"just have copies in pitsburg in 6 weeks or whatever, and ill throw money at you @SageSaga"
16-05-2019T21:43:20,Tharkis,:ctharkis-takemymoney:
16-05-2019T21:43:24,Strawbetch,"It can do most of what Photoshop can do and it's free, my dude."
16-05-2019T21:43:47,Nekonny,wasnt CS3 free or something for a while?
16-05-2019T21:43:55,SageSaga,CS2
16-05-2019T21:44:11,Tharkis,CS2
16-05-2019T21:44:21,Strawbetch,I think there was a time where they let people use their older software for free for a while.
16-05-2019T21:44:25,Tharkis,which ironically is the version i bought as i graduated college while i still had student discount
16-05-2019T21:44:28,SageSaga,and it wasnt free - it was just impossible to keep from being pirated
16-05-2019T21:44:42,Mihari,I'd be okay with Photoshop if it still sold the buy it and own it thing
16-05-2019T21:44:43,Tharkis,and which my registration details got lost =/
16-05-2019T21:44:56,SageSaga,and* the legit way of using it was impossible to register
16-05-2019T21:45:08,SageSaga,so they had to make it open or else people who bought it couldnt use it XD
16-05-2019T21:45:14,Tharkis,so i'm using CS2 without registration now lol
16-05-2019T21:45:26,Tharkis,but i paid for it ! =/
16-05-2019T21:45:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I return with loaded tater
16-05-2019T21:45:41,Tharkis,i've got a copy of autocad that i cant use either that i paid waaayyy to mch for
16-05-2019T21:45:55,Nekonny,I'm usinf Cs6
16-05-2019T21:47:00,AspiringNoodle,I think Adobe switched to the subscription model because it's harder to innovate these days.
16-05-2019T21:47:07,SageSaga,the only thing i really lost by moving to Clip over Photoshop- was Spell Check XD
16-05-2019T21:47:33,AspiringNoodle,So you give Clip a seal of approval?
16-05-2019T21:47:57,SageSaga,if you get it on sale 100% if you dont 99%
16-05-2019T21:48:04,AspiringNoodle,Haha.
16-05-2019T21:48:05,Tharkis,i've got a copy of clip and i just cant get used to it >_<
16-05-2019T21:48:13,Tharkis,"i'm too used to photoshop, been using photoshop since 1993"
16-05-2019T21:48:31,AspiringNoodle,"Tbh, $50 for a one-time purchase sounds so much nicer than Adobe's cheapest $10 a month (but really $120 for a year)"
16-05-2019T21:48:43,Strawbetch,Is Macromedia Flash 5 an Adobe thing?
16-05-2019T21:48:48,Tharkis,"if you use it to make money though, 10$ a month is cheap"
16-05-2019T21:48:51,Tharkis,cheaper than picarto
16-05-2019T21:49:00,Strawbetch,"I know Adobe has something to do with Flash, I think."
16-05-2019T21:49:10,SageSaga,Picarto is stupid expensive tbh
16-05-2019T21:49:46,AspiringNoodle,I did some research.  The $10 a month more or less matches the people who upgraded their Photoshop versions ever other time.
16-05-2019T21:49:53,Tharkis,picarto needs to allow people to buy subscriptions as gifts for others
16-05-2019T21:50:06,Tharkis,"lots of artists i know who couold use premium, but dont want to shell out for it, i'd just buy it for them >_<"
16-05-2019T21:50:21,AspiringNoodle,What does premium membership with Picarto offer?
16-05-2019T21:50:21,Nekonny,\o/
16-05-2019T21:50:24,Strawbetch,"Hey so, can only the muns hold Picarto streams?"
16-05-2019T21:50:37,Nekonny,multis anywat
16-05-2019T21:50:40,Nekonny,y
16-05-2019T21:50:49,Tharkis,"multi streams, 50 emojis"
16-05-2019T21:51:00,RandomTonio,All that stuff
16-05-2019T21:51:23,RandomTonio,Just don‚Äôt get banned while on a multi stream
16-05-2019T21:51:25,Tharkis,ability to have people subscribe to your stream to access your emojis
16-05-2019T21:51:43,AspiringNoodle,"Ah, classic ""spend money to make money"" deal, eh?"
16-05-2019T21:52:07,Tharkis,:ctwokinds-NoraEyebrows:
16-05-2019T21:52:24,Bgrmystr2,"you can stream if you have a normal account, and you can join someone who has a multi as well, but only someone who pays for a higher tier account can start a multi @Strawbetch"
16-05-2019T21:52:48,Chalodraws,"I tried to set up subs for mine, but I coldnt."
16-05-2019T21:53:17,Chalodraws,because of country and whatevs
16-05-2019T21:53:26,AspiringNoodle,:(
16-05-2019T21:55:52,Strawbetch,"good to know, though I meant more like can only Chalo, Sage, Nekkony and I guess whoever else is a mod for the Discord do streaming stuff?"
16-05-2019T21:56:32,RandomTonio,Where are some good discord servers to join?
16-05-2019T21:56:33,SageSaga,Discord has nothing to do with this
16-05-2019T21:56:59,RandomTonio,Worth a shot
16-05-2019T21:57:47,Strawbetch,No?
16-05-2019T21:57:55,Strawbetch,Alrighty then.
16-05-2019T22:02:55,Bgrmystr2,picarto and discord are two separate entities broman
16-05-2019T22:03:38,ZRO4825,flops into the chat.
16-05-2019T22:04:56,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock: Zroooooo

16-05-2019T22:06:26,Chalodraws,Hey Jinti
16-05-2019T22:06:46,Strawbetch,"I meant like, can only the mods of the Katbox Chatbox host streams."

16-05-2019T22:20:24,AspiringNoodle,I built my computer in 2013.  It uses mid-range components from them.  I'm rather worried about the CPU more than anything.
16-05-2019T22:20:34,AspiringNoodle,It's been abused quite a bit ^^;
16-05-2019T22:22:15,AspiringNoodle,It just needs to last for another 2 months.

16-05-2019T23:03:11,Mippy,Ooops...thats wrestling
16-05-2019T23:03:22,SageSaga,nice save
16-05-2019T23:03:28,DNMZ,Haha
16-05-2019T23:03:37,Chalodraws,Mud wrestling
16-05-2019T23:03:46,SageSaga,dangit Chalo
16-05-2019T23:04:06,Mippy,Sounds like a good time
16-05-2019T23:04:48,DNMZ,Now wait I'm sure mud wrestling can be very sfw. Just need to put the girls in sumo suits lol
16-05-2019T23:05:26,Mihari,^_^;
16-05-2019T23:07:46,SpazztasticKiwi,"do si do and promenade, when they‚Äôre on the floor, pull out the grenade"
16-05-2019T23:08:36,ZRO4825,lol
16-05-2019T23:09:17,SpazztasticKiwi,"now don‚Äôt be shy, pull that pin ladies it‚Äôs your floor again"
16-05-2019T23:10:42,DNMZ,Is that how square dancing goes ? Glad I have tried it. It sounds dangerous lol
16-05-2019T23:10:48,SpazztasticKiwi,I can also line dance but that‚Äôs not necessarily for partners
16-05-2019T23:11:43,SpazztasticKiwi,In reality square dancing usually has music going but there‚Äôs a person at the mic giving what move you do next. Unless you‚Äôve got a square dance song on
16-05-2019T23:12:27,SpazztasticKiwi,As long as you know what moves they‚Äôre talking about you‚Äôre ok. Like southern cupid shuffle
16-05-2019T23:13:00,DNMZ,No idea what that is
16-05-2019T23:13:19,Mippy,So..like the Cha Cha Slide...but even lamer. XD
16-05-2019T23:13:19,SpazztasticKiwi,cupid shuffle‚Äôs on YT
16-05-2019T23:13:50,SpazztasticKiwi,it can get complicated depending on how fast the instructor goes
16-05-2019T23:14:12,DNMZ,Mmm ok
16-05-2019T23:14:24,Mippy,"No, but really...if it's something you enjoy and it keeps you active...go for it"
16-05-2019T23:15:03,SpazztasticKiwi,"line dancing, you just go with what‚Äôs next in the sequence. If it‚Äôs time to tap it out, turn, or whatever"
16-05-2019T23:17:10,SageSaga,oh boy- thunderstorm
16-05-2019T23:17:17,MarvTheHugPharaoh,lucky
16-05-2019T23:17:22,AspiringNoodle,Love me a good thunderstorm
16-05-2019T23:17:30,Mippy,ooooo...
16-05-2019T23:17:36,Chalodraws,just started raining here
16-05-2019T23:17:54,AspiringNoodle,I'm just a fan of bad weather in general <3
16-05-2019T23:18:02,DNMZ,I like the rain
16-05-2019T23:18:09,Mippy,Let me have some! I just have cloudy
16-05-2019T23:18:14,AspiringNoodle,"Thunderstorms, thundershowers, heavy downpours, gimme."
16-05-2019T23:18:15,SpazztasticKiwi,boom boom might make stream go boom boom though
16-05-2019T23:18:27,AspiringNoodle,^ Only downside of bad weather ^^;
16-05-2019T23:18:36,AspiringNoodle,"It's all fun and games until the power goes out, haha"
16-05-2019T23:18:52,scythemouse,I'll take thunder only if it comes with a lot of rain. We're in forest fire territory up here.
16-05-2019T23:19:25,Strawbetch,"As long as said thunderstorm doesn't bring its spinny party friend who likes to pick up cars and houses, I'm chill."
16-05-2019T23:20:01,DNMZ,When it gets cloudy and starts to rain my grandma would always make pancakes and hot chocolate. Good times
16-05-2019T23:20:12,AspiringNoodle,"Gotta love nature.  It's like no matter where you live, something will try to kill you eventually."
16-05-2019T23:20:14,Mippy,Tch! You know Tornados only hit trailer parks....
16-05-2019T23:21:10,AspiringNoodle,"Take your pick: Earthquake, hurricane / tsunami, tornado, blizzard, or flood."
16-05-2019T23:21:16,FoxxTrotter,"No thunderstorms here. I was pretty nice today. It's gonna be hot this weekend, though."
16-05-2019T23:21:20,Bgrmystr2,"do not want, noodle"
16-05-2019T23:21:31,AspiringNoodle,"Too bad, no matter where you live you're gonna get one or more, lmao"
16-05-2019T23:21:34,DNMZ,I'd go with blizzard
16-05-2019T23:22:18,Mippy,"Blizzards, Hurricanes, and flooding are normal where I grew up. They are nothing"
16-05-2019T23:22:21,FoxxTrotter,I could go with a Dairy Queen blizzard. :0)
16-05-2019T23:22:31,AspiringNoodle,"Delicious, but not an option :p"
16-05-2019T23:22:46,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Where I'm at its only rain, we don't get storms like that"
16-05-2019T23:23:29,AspiringNoodle,"Where I live, we get lots of tornado warnings / watches, but I can't recall one forming in my lifetime."
16-05-2019T23:23:30,DNMZ,Actually I'd like a blizzard. Have never seen snow in my live
16-05-2019T23:23:58,AspiringNoodle,"More often than not, the worst we have to deal with is lots of rain.  And that's typically fallout from hurricanes / tropical storms."
16-05-2019T23:24:04,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"snow is a lot of fun, and can make some of the coziest atmosphere"
16-05-2019T23:24:25,Mippy,We once cooked paasta over candles because a storm knocked out the power for weeks
16-05-2019T23:24:27,AspiringNoodle,"Snow is the only reason I tolerate the cold in the winter.  No snow, winter can flip off."
16-05-2019T23:24:52,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"I love cold weather, I'm already wanting summer to be over"
16-05-2019T23:25:17,SageSaga,only thing i want from summer is the pool to be open
16-05-2019T23:25:32,Strawbetch,I prefer winter myself.
16-05-2019T23:25:35,Strawbetch,No bugs then.
16-05-2019T23:25:43,Strawbetch,Or at least not as much.
16-05-2019T23:26:00,AspiringNoodle,Spring / early summer for me.
16-05-2019T23:26:04,Mippy,The river thawing out is a greaat summer thing
16-05-2019T23:26:59,SageSaga,if we didnt have summer- how could we appreciate winter?
16-05-2019T23:27:20,Mippy,Sage's wisdom
16-05-2019T23:28:00,Strawbetch,"True, but it's been getting longer -and *hotter*- on my end."
16-05-2019T23:28:15,Strawbetch,...
16-05-2019T23:28:28,AspiringNoodle,I guess I like summer where I live because of the amount of thunderstorms we get
16-05-2019T23:28:35,SageSaga,welcome to climate change
16-05-2019T23:28:45,AspiringNoodle,"For some reason, I don't care for really nice days."
16-05-2019T23:28:54,AspiringNoodle,I just like the worst weather imaginable.
16-05-2019T23:29:16,AspiringNoodle,"Then again, maybe it's because it's a huge contrast to the safety and modern comforts of the home?"
16-05-2019T23:29:41,SageSaga,i lose power in relatively small storms- so im not a fan
16-05-2019T23:30:03,AspiringNoodle,That *used* to be my experience.
16-05-2019T23:30:24,AspiringNoodle,Then the power company came and trimmed all the trees near the power lines because the homeowners are lazy xD
16-05-2019T23:30:34,Mippy,Quick Sage! cmd+s just in case!
16-05-2019T23:30:37,AspiringNoodle,"And they did a fantastically ugly job, too!"
16-05-2019T23:30:52,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Thats when you make the excuse ""Oh nothing to do, time to nap.""  its what I do"
16-05-2019T23:31:00,SageSaga,home owners arent allowed to cut trees near power lines
16-05-2019T23:31:04,SageSaga,in most states
16-05-2019T23:31:25,SageSaga,they risk harming a public utility - its a big no no
16-05-2019T23:31:50,AspiringNoodle,"Well, when the branches are super close to touching the lines / overbearing, yeah."
16-05-2019T23:31:58,AspiringNoodle,Anything about them doing it before it gets to that point?
16-05-2019T23:32:07,SageSaga,yes
16-05-2019T23:32:19,FoxxTrotter,"Naw...the utility companies have Asplundh do that here. The ""half"" trees are a damn eyesore, but it does keep the branches away from the power lines."
16-05-2019T23:32:27,SageSaga,no work can be done around public utilities without permission
16-05-2019T23:32:46,AspiringNoodle,"Well, can't argue with that."
16-05-2019T23:34:13,SageSaga,besides- and we've had this happen in our area- a man tried to do just that- cut the top of a tree off before it got to the point it would hit the power lines
16-05-2019T23:34:56,SageSaga,the ladder he used must have been steel or something because it bridged the power from the line into the ground and through him
16-05-2019T23:35:19,AspiringNoodle,"Jesus, how close was he???"
16-05-2019T23:35:28,FoxxTrotter,"Too close, apparently."
16-05-2019T23:35:52,SageSaga,the power lines arent that high around some areas around here- but the report was his ladder was like a 15 foot ladder?
16-05-2019T23:36:52,Bgrmystr2,"it must have touched a transformer or something, because power lines are supposed to be shielded. You can touch them with your bare hands and nothing happens. It's when they're cut or if you touch the ends where the electricity is ran is when it's dangero"
16-05-2019T23:36:54,SageSaga,we also had a kid get fried driving a go-kart under the super high voltage power lines
16-05-2019T23:36:57,Bgrmystr2,dangerous*
16-05-2019T23:38:19,SageSaga,uhmm- i dont think thats entirely true BGR
16-05-2019T23:38:37,FoxxTrotter,It's not.
16-05-2019T23:39:12,SageSaga,birds dont fry when they touch them because they arent grounded- but if you are grounded and you touch one -
16-05-2019T23:39:18,Bgrmystr2,"far as I'm aware, power lines are supposed to have enough shielding to prevent you from getting shocked if you touch them. If they don't, they're probably old."
16-05-2019T23:39:30,DNMZ,I once saw a kid climb up on a stationary train. Was playing around up there and then walked face first into one of the cables. Really sad
16-05-2019T23:40:48,SageSaga,yeah Bgr i just double checked- most arent insulated to a point that they are safe to touch
16-05-2019T23:41:31,SageSaga,i think bucket trucks are designed to not have a ground
16-05-2019T23:42:01,Bgrmystr2,"That's kinda sad. I thought there were regulations and standards. Though I guess those mean nothing even if they were in effect, they can't see everything."
16-05-2019T23:42:40,SageSaga,"there are standards and regulations- and thats ""you must be a trained individual to mess with this stuff!"""
16-05-2019T23:43:06,SageSaga,besides- to insulate them fully they would become too heavy for most connections
16-05-2019T23:43:16,Bgrmystr2,not that. Specifically for having enough insulation so someone can touch the wires
16-05-2019T23:43:44,SageSaga,as i said- that is impractical
16-05-2019T23:44:52,Bgrmystr2,maybe if the standing safety hazard electrical poles aren't properly set up to hold them up lol
16-05-2019T23:45:26,SageSaga,you would have to double the number of poles or make them out of stronger materials
16-05-2019T23:56:36,FoxxTrotter,"I have to get up early, so I'm off to bed. G'night, everyone. :0)"
16-05-2019T23:56:50,SageSaga,take care Foxx!@
16-05-2019T23:57:41,MarvTheHugPharaoh,nighty night foxx
16-05-2019T23:57:52,NazaPaLaRaza,Howdy
16-05-2019T23:58:07,SageSaga,hello
16-05-2019T23:58:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Naza
16-05-2019T23:58:31,NazaPaLaRaza,How life is going ?
16-05-2019T23:58:39,Kynum,suuup
16-05-2019T23:59:05,SageSaga,yo
16-05-2019T23:59:42,AspiringNoodle,Life is... complicated? xD
16-05-2019T23:59:51,AspiringNoodle,I feel like I had my mid-life crisis a decade or two too soon :p
