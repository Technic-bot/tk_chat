06-01-2019T13:00:11,Xexanoth,@Iliar it might be because NibblyBot isn't subscribed anymore? at least the symbol is missing next to the name
06-01-2019T13:01:37,iliar,The fact is that: Nibs is subscriber.

06-01-2019T16:02:18,Mippy,:ctwokinds-sadtrace2: Poor Quill
06-01-2019T16:02:32,Twokinds,Why'd you do that?
06-01-2019T16:03:10,CrimsonQuill,Maths exam. Every blasted formula I learned disappeared the moment I started the paper.
06-01-2019T16:03:15,CrimsonQuill,And it was CALCULUS.
06-01-2019T16:03:20,Mippy,Ouch
06-01-2019T16:03:36,CrimsonQuill,INTEGRATION. DIFFERENTIATION. PARTIAL DERIVATIVES.
06-01-2019T16:04:03,CrimsonQuill,"I had them all off before I began, but once I opened the paper, I couldn't remember the processes."
06-01-2019T16:04:19,Mippy,Isen't that how it goes
06-01-2019T16:05:49,Mippy,I put canvas on my frame today...aand stapled myself...
06-01-2019T16:06:41,Mippy,Teacher told me to stop bleeding and get back to work
06-01-2019T16:08:23,CrimsonQuill,"But it's done. My dad called, said chillax, have a good night's kip, and tomorrow, study for the next one."
06-01-2019T16:08:31,CrimsonQuill,And I'm drawing Subnautica
06-01-2019T16:08:46,CrimsonQuill,Because why not? :ctwokinds-rose:
06-01-2019T16:13:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Ay Tom
06-01-2019T16:14:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Too bad breaks over
06-01-2019T16:26:01,Twokinds,I can't remember anything about Math
06-01-2019T16:26:49,CrimsonQuill,I have to.
06-01-2019T16:27:07,CrimsonQuill,Though I'm baffled as to how integrals in calculus relate to surveying.
06-01-2019T16:35:01,Mippy,"Tom, I just got to the part in yesterdays stream where yiu said Carver and Clovis are half bros. Which one is olde?"
06-01-2019T16:35:09,Mippy,*r
06-01-2019T16:45:55,CrimsonQuill,"Well, bedtime. Goodnight! :ptv-greetings::ptv-sleepy::ctwokinds-RainezZz:"
06-01-2019T16:53:30,Twokinds,lol
06-01-2019T16:53:42,Twokinds,I was kind of joking.
06-01-2019T16:54:10,Mippy,:ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
06-01-2019T16:58:43,Twokinds,Though it is an interesting thought
06-01-2019T16:59:02,Twokinds,Could make for an intriging angle.
06-01-2019T16:59:15,Twokinds,"Clovis hates foxes, but has a half brother who is full fox."
06-01-2019T16:59:28,Mippy,Much agree
06-01-2019T16:59:53,Twokinds,"I'd say if they were, Carver would be younger"
06-01-2019T17:00:23,Mippy,Alright
06-01-2019T17:00:57,Twokinds,Maybe his mother leaving to have another son with a different father also fueled Clovis' misogyny.
06-01-2019T17:02:01,Mippy,I belive it's probubly happend. I think I saw that sort of thing in a couple of murder documentries.
06-01-2019T17:07:34,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
06-01-2019T17:09:06,Mippy,"Hey, I just won three games of Solitaire in a row. :ctwokinds-lynnsmile:"
06-01-2019T17:10:18,TerraTheWizard,noice
06-01-2019T17:36:19,Mandag,"I always assumed Clovis kept Carver around because he apparently has an infalliable human accent, and is a skilled but overconfident mage. Useful for undercover work among the humans."
06-01-2019T18:07:56,Mippy,"Oh...Kat is so confused. XD Love it. I thought eric's middle name was Adrian....:ctwokinds-floraquestion: Eh, probubly anouther jokke I'm not picking up on."
06-01-2019T18:28:50,SpazztasticKiwi,I had food
06-01-2019T18:40:14,Twokinds,"Oh right, it is, isn't it?"
06-01-2019T18:40:25,Twokinds,I couldn't remember if I'd ever mentioned it before
06-01-2019T18:40:33,Twokinds,And I didn't want to try looking it up on stream
06-01-2019T18:42:27,Mippy,"Yeah, It's was in Alabaster and Eric's trivia battle. XD It's ok."
06-01-2019T18:42:46,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
06-01-2019T18:44:38,Dadrobit,Oof. Just got home. Agreed to be a courier for my sister's company for some extra money on the side for the next two weeks. Decent money. But my back is killing me.
06-01-2019T18:45:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Kill it back
06-01-2019T18:45:21,Mippy,^
06-01-2019T18:45:36,Dadrobit,"Nah, I already tried that a few times."
06-01-2019T18:45:56,Mippy,Give it the durgs?
06-01-2019T18:46:15,unsteddyphoenix,tell it to back off
06-01-2019T18:46:21,Dadrobit,Can't. I don't do drugs when I have to be functional within 24 hours.
06-01-2019T18:46:39,SpazztasticKiwi,She may just mean ibuprofen
06-01-2019T18:46:54,Dadrobit,"Oh. Yeah, that's already wel on board."
06-01-2019T18:46:57,Dadrobit,well*
06-01-2019T18:47:07,Mippy,....I ment like...Tylonal...but that's good to know XD
06-01-2019T18:47:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Ibuprofen. Tylonal. Whichever

06-01-2019T18:48:40,Mippy,I got to go back to class in an hour
06-01-2019T18:49:19,Dadrobit,I might be going out with grandaddy and the little bro in an hour. Don't actually know if I'm gonna be up for it honestly.
06-01-2019T18:50:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Didn‚Äôt you say your brother was older
06-01-2019T18:50:28,Dadrobit,I have many brothers.
06-01-2019T18:50:43,unsteddyphoenix,A man of many brothers
06-01-2019T18:50:43,SpazztasticKiwi,God rest your soul
06-01-2019T18:50:47,Dadrobit,Only one little brother.
06-01-2019T18:50:57,SpazztasticKiwi,I hear it‚Äôs fun to have a brother
06-01-2019T18:50:59,Dadrobit,3 brothers and 3 sisters I think.
06-01-2019T18:51:09,Dadrobit,"Yeah, 3 of each."
06-01-2019T18:51:32,Dadrobit,None are full blood though. And 3 are step siblings.
06-01-2019T18:51:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Heaven help me if I end up somehow having 7 kids
06-01-2019T18:52:17,SpazztasticKiwi,You just got a bit of a mixed fruit basket there huh
06-01-2019T18:52:45,Dadrobit,"By the way, did you mean ""Comme ci, comme √ßa"" before? That's supposed to be French, it means ""so-so""."
06-01-2019T18:53:25,Dadrobit,"Yeah, two half siblings from my father, one half sibling from my egg donor, and three step siblings from my current step mother."
06-01-2019T18:53:38,Mippy,I know what it means....:ctwokinds-smug:
06-01-2019T18:53:41,unsteddyphoenix,c'est la vie
06-01-2019T18:53:51,SpazztasticKiwi,I hope there‚Äôs no quiz after this
06-01-2019T18:54:08,unsteddyphoenix,It does sound like the setup to a maths question
06-01-2019T18:54:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh yeah Tom that reminds me -did you get that iconic meet up with the Markiplier you were looking forward to?
06-01-2019T18:54:19,Dadrobit,"My father hates ""c'est la vi"" and sayings like that."
06-01-2019T18:54:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I got 5 minutes before lunch is done

06-01-2019T18:59:12,ThingsAreMoving,Next time get a tennis racquet before you say those words
06-01-2019T18:59:16,Dadrobit,The only way I'd fail his test I think is if I manage to end up dying without accomplishing anything worthwhile  in my life.
06-01-2019T18:59:22,ThingsAreMoving,if he throws something at you just bounce it back
06-01-2019T18:59:36,unsteddyphoenix,Things are thinking out here

06-01-2019T19:05:41,ThingsAreMoving,:ctwokinds-florajiggle:
06-01-2019T19:06:48,Mippy,Ugh! They got the back door open. It's heacking cold.
06-01-2019T19:07:15,ThingsAreMoving,Give them hell for not closing the doors.
06-01-2019T19:08:13,Mippy,They are burning boxes in the back yard.
06-01-2019T19:08:52,ThingsAreMoving,btw I've spotted some job offers with basically the same stuff that I do now that are paying 3-5k ¬£ more per year.
06-01-2019T19:09:08,ThingsAreMoving,Really thinking about changing workplace this year
06-01-2019T19:09:26,unsteddyphoenix,"You could talk to your boss about a raise, and cite those places? :thinking:"
06-01-2019T19:09:27,Mippy,Always take more
06-01-2019T19:10:42,ThingsAreMoving,"I'm planning on doing that. Gonna print them out when I'll be asking for a raise, but there's a very slim chance I'll get it."
06-01-2019T19:11:09,ThingsAreMoving,there are people in this company that have been working here for 25+ years and they are on minimum wage
06-01-2019T19:11:44,ThingsAreMoving,"they're not skilled nor have any interest to learn stuff, but still"
06-01-2019T19:11:53,ThingsAreMoving,a bit sad
06-01-2019T19:12:05,unsteddyphoenix,"bluh, thats unpleasant"
06-01-2019T19:12:21,Mippy,Dang...That sucks
06-01-2019T19:12:25,ThingsAreMoving,"Also, changing workplace would involve moving to a different city, many miles away."
06-01-2019T19:12:53,unsteddyphoenix,tactically leave that part out
06-01-2019T19:13:23,ThingsAreMoving,"Yeah, just before christmas I was chatting with a lady that is working for this company for 27 years and she was shocked when she'd learned that I make more than 300¬£ per week"
06-01-2019T19:13:54,Twokinds,:O
06-01-2019T19:13:54,unsteddyphoenix,bizzare people could be so apathetic to their finances
06-01-2019T19:14:00,Twokinds,Yeah I know.
06-01-2019T19:14:18,ThingsAreMoving,I didn't tell her that it's closer to 350. She was already crushed
06-01-2019T19:16:10,Mippy,How much is that in CAD? $594...I probubly normally make about that.
06-01-2019T19:17:20,ThingsAreMoving,Well I've checked how much would a worker with my skill set and knowledge earn in canada. Turns out it's around 25CAD per hour.
06-01-2019T19:18:03,Mippy,"Yeah, my dad get's about that."
06-01-2019T19:18:14,ThingsAreMoving,"Dunno if it's a decent wage over there cuz I don't know anything about the costs of living, though."
06-01-2019T19:18:42,Mippy,It's pretty good.
06-01-2019T19:18:52,ThingsAreMoving,But I'm exploring the possibility that I'll move over there if stuff gets really weird with that brexit thingy.
06-01-2019T19:19:03,Dadrobit,350¬£ is around 447$ USD. Used to make a fair bit more just in security. Sometimes I miss that gig.
06-01-2019T19:20:08,ThingsAreMoving,"Yeah, Dad but compare the costs of living, though. I live with two other guys in a rented house with a small garden, and monthly rent+bills is ~1240¬£"
06-01-2019T19:20:30,ThingsAreMoving,so around 430-440 per month per person
06-01-2019T19:20:58,ThingsAreMoving,"200 for food and alcohol, all the rest is going into savings"
06-01-2019T19:23:14,ThingsAreMoving,And yet... still not enough savings to get a mortgage even for a single bedroom flat.
06-01-2019T19:23:17,Dadrobit,Bills + food is $950-$1k depending on the month. Used to make about $550 a week after taxes + the inevitable 8-16 hours of overtime.
06-01-2019T19:23:30,Mippy,"Well, got to start the commute back to class. See ya :ptv-greetings:"
06-01-2019T19:23:36,ThingsAreMoving,o/ Mipps
06-01-2019T19:23:40,Dadrobit,o/ Mippy
06-01-2019T19:23:43,ThingsAreMoving,get educated
06-01-2019T19:23:53,ThingsAreMoving,I hear knowledge is good
06-01-2019T19:24:55,Dadrobit,So your cost of living is slightly better than my own. But my old pay more than made up the difference.
06-01-2019T19:25:39,ThingsAreMoving,seems like it
06-01-2019T19:26:30,Dadrobit,Alack and alas. Here I am doing courier work on the side still to make up for last month.
06-01-2019T19:27:33,ThingsAreMoving,Funny how some people complain they can't find a job and you just pick one to make up for a worse month
06-01-2019T19:27:43,Dadrobit,"Trying to get in as an engineer in a local studio, but damn near no one is hiring. Most aren't even offering internships."
06-01-2019T19:28:03,Dadrobit,It's who ya know.
06-01-2019T19:28:21,Dadrobit,I know my sister. And she knew her company needed a courier.
06-01-2019T19:28:22,ThingsAreMoving,"That's the thing, if you'd have savings you could try get an unpaid internship just for the sake of experience"
06-01-2019T19:29:05,ThingsAreMoving,It's the same like getting a mortgage. Paying it off is easier than actually getting it.
06-01-2019T19:29:29,ThingsAreMoving,"once you're in, you can show you can handle stuff"
06-01-2019T19:29:37,Dadrobit,"Nah, unpaid internships are kinda bullshit out here. We have several schools in the area that specifically only pump out audio engineers every six months. So studios just pick them up and toss them out for the next batch."
06-01-2019T19:29:52,ThingsAreMoving,Oooof
06-01-2019T19:30:01,Dadrobit,Fresh free labor every six months.
06-01-2019T19:30:39,ThingsAreMoving,"welp, just keep trying"
06-01-2019T19:31:00,Dadrobit,"Yeah, pretty much."
06-01-2019T19:31:25,Dadrobit,"And when I need the extra dosh on the side, I just install shower doors for a buddy of mine on the side lol."
06-01-2019T19:31:41,ThingsAreMoving,Truly a land of opportunities
06-01-2019T19:31:50,Dadrobit,"Specifically, my old junior high workshop teacher."
06-01-2019T19:32:10,Dadrobit,It pays to keep in touch with people.
06-01-2019T19:33:49,ThingsAreMoving,A good skill set is helpful too I'd wager.
06-01-2019T19:34:39,Dadrobit,"It's all just hand tools for the most part. A tablesaw in the bed of the truck, and glass handles."
06-01-2019T19:35:19,Dadrobit,"I feel a little guilty that it's under the table, but then I remember I like eating."
06-01-2019T19:35:40,ThingsAreMoving,Just don't let the taxman find out
06-01-2019T19:36:01,Dadrobit,"Paid in cash, immediately goes into paying for foodstuffs."
06-01-2019T19:36:09,Dadrobit,"Poof, never existed."
06-01-2019T19:36:41,ThingsAreMoving,the only evidence are your moobs

06-01-2019T20:18:15,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also, not to sound creepy but round here, young men are well liked"
06-01-2019T20:18:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Lots of unable bodied people looking for someone still capable of lifting past their knees...or more than 100 pounds
06-01-2019T20:37:10,Twokinds,I can't lift 100 pounds.
06-01-2019T20:37:26,Twokinds,Mostly because I don't want to.
06-01-2019T20:37:51,SpazztasticKiwi,You lift yourself don‚Äôt you?
06-01-2019T20:41:13,SpazztasticKiwi,I can lift 100. Just if I have a good grip. And if it‚Äôs mainly carried on my left - my right arm doesn‚Äôt work as well since I broke it
06-01-2019T21:02:13,THETOXICATOR,I can take 100 too
06-01-2019T21:24:31,Mippy,I need a Mac compatible 16GB thumb drive and or external hard drive. Yay...tech stuff. I guess...:ctwokinds-floraquestion:

06-01-2019T22:35:52,SpazztasticKiwi,The monster is Lilysha
06-01-2019T22:36:04,SpazztasticKiwi,That screenshot is one of my Lilysha
06-01-2019T22:36:45,SpazztasticKiwi,She‚Äôs not a terribly good fighter but she can possess enemies so they attack their own team

06-01-2019T22:37:38,unsteddyphoenix,FIERCE
06-01-2019T22:38:47,SpazztasticKiwi,There‚Äôs also other female monsters whose got some...interesting outfits but I only have Lilysha and Cyan Nathura
06-01-2019T22:40:24,SpazztasticKiwi,And Demise and General Nishant‚Äôs bodyguard and Bright
06-01-2019T22:41:36,SpazztasticKiwi,"And if you think her outfits fierce, you should see her default animation"
06-01-2019T22:58:26,SpazztasticKiwi,"Think you‚Äôll use it , Tom?"
06-01-2019T23:02:31,Twokinds,That outfit is very.. spikey
06-01-2019T23:02:38,Twokinds,I feel like it would be uncomfortable
06-01-2019T23:03:28,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
06-01-2019T23:03:53,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, it could be worse."
06-01-2019T23:05:04,SpazztasticKiwi,She‚Äôs a dragon
06-01-2019T23:05:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Would spikes really hurt her that much
06-01-2019T23:05:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"Though if you want to point out what‚Äôs uncomfortable about it, it‚Äôs the nightmare that is the lack of chest support"
06-01-2019T23:06:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"And some of those spikes are because Lilysha is a demonic type monster - ie, spikes abound"
06-01-2019T23:06:49,Bgrmystr2,"pff, at least she has support. When you started talkin about outfits for nora, I immediately thought of Andariel from Diablo 2."
06-01-2019T23:08:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Now that top is just bull
06-01-2019T23:08:13,Bgrmystr2,hahahaha ikr
06-01-2019T23:08:15,SpazztasticKiwi,That‚Äôs like

06-01-2019T23:08:32,Bgrmystr2,but yeah it could be that.
06-01-2019T23:08:47,Bgrmystr2,so at least your lil demon girl's got some kind of support.
06-01-2019T23:09:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Do you want to see the abomination that is her animation?
06-01-2019T23:09:14,Bgrmystr2,sure
06-01-2019T23:11:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôll try to get discord to cooperate
06-01-2019T23:15:43,SpazztasticKiwi,It took its time but it‚Äôs there
06-01-2019T23:16:28,Bgrmystr2,wow there's like zero physics with that animation
06-01-2019T23:16:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Whoever animated her boobs should be shot
06-01-2019T23:16:42,Bgrmystr2,the whole body is just bad in general
06-01-2019T23:16:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Makes my chest hurt just watching
06-01-2019T23:17:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Anyone else want to share this pain?
06-01-2019T23:17:23,Bgrmystr2,it's not that bouncy though
06-01-2019T23:17:57,Bgrmystr2,"least, doesn't seem like it to me"
06-01-2019T23:18:17,SpazztasticKiwi,That‚Äôs her default animation - as in that‚Äôs how she stands while not in use in battle and in her habitat
06-01-2019T23:18:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Thats all she does. On a loop. Her attack animations are different though
06-01-2019T23:19:42,SpazztasticKiwi,"Just seeing the outfit though, has made me imagine Nora"
06-01-2019T23:25:43,SpazztasticKiwi,"On an unrelated note, Bagheera‚Äôs giving me acupuncture"

06-01-2019T23:54:02,Ordithus,It can be fun to see how it plays out

06-01-2019T23:57:51,SpazztasticKiwi,And why a random pull for monopoly
