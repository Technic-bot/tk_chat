13-10-2019T10:18:16,SpazztasticKiwi,you can’t prove it
13-10-2019T10:32:37,SpazztasticKiwi,exactly what a mass of aliens would say
13-10-2019T10:37:02,ThingsAreMoving,"Of course I can prove it, I can take a selfie and post it here"
13-10-2019T10:39:06,ThingsAreMoving,not gonna do it though :ctwokinds-smug:
13-10-2019T10:56:26,TeapotOfDoom,Resistance is futile

13-10-2019T11:23:36,TeapotOfDoom,I'm happy this is back :ctwokinds-katdryer: the name alone is gold
13-10-2019T11:55:21,AspiringNoodle,Uh oh... Kat was super soaked
13-10-2019T11:55:33,AspiringNoodle,"Quick, she needs the fast cycle D:"
13-10-2019T11:56:16,AspiringNoodle,"This isn't just wetness, it's advanced wetness!"
13-10-2019T12:06:20,TeapotOfDoom,I would love to have the neon version of the emote right now
13-10-2019T12:11:34,AspiringNoodle,RGB has gone too far
13-10-2019T12:12:11,AspiringNoodle,And I still have yet to install the control software xD
13-10-2019T12:54:31,TeapotOfDoom,Rainbow barf?
13-10-2019T13:37:37,AspiringNoodle,Pretty effects rainbow barf :D
13-10-2019T13:38:13,AspiringNoodle,"GPU / CPU cooler just cycle through colors, fans do a rainbow wheel (but it's not a continuous stream, so it bugs me), and the ram has this pretty waterfall effect that I don't mind too much"

13-10-2019T16:12:53,TeapotOfDoom,oh noes
13-10-2019T16:13:13,TeapotOfDoom,well that just sounds like a way to get punched for suer
13-10-2019T17:12:22,SpazztasticKiwi,there’s this house they’re selling
13-10-2019T17:12:30,SpazztasticKiwi,2 bed 2 bath
13-10-2019T17:12:44,SpazztasticKiwi,but the main bath has a shower AND a tub
13-10-2019T17:12:50,SpazztasticKiwi,separate
13-10-2019T17:12:59,AspiringNoodle,BLISSSSS
13-10-2019T17:13:07,AspiringNoodle,I would love a tub that's big enough for me to lie in :/
13-10-2019T17:18:09,TeapotOfDoom,you're thinking about getting it spazz?
13-10-2019T17:24:55,SpazztasticKiwi,heh

13-10-2019T17:26:31,SpazztasticKiwi,there’s a third bed it seems
13-10-2019T17:26:53,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t even need 2 unless I find friends that want to rent
13-10-2019T17:32:35,TeapotOfDoom,give it to bagheera
13-10-2019T17:42:36,TeapotOfDoom,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
13-10-2019T18:25:54,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
13-10-2019T18:40:28,SpazztasticKiwi,in theory one room would go to the cats
13-10-2019T18:41:27,SpazztasticKiwi,but a more bedroom house means more money and Bagheera just about only sleeps in my room
13-10-2019T19:56:53,SpazztasticKiwi,guess who found their spare contact solution bottle after buying a second twin pack
13-10-2019T20:06:43,Ordithus,"Bagheera?  ""Oh, you were looking for this?  I mean meow"""
13-10-2019T20:08:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera’s being a grumpy wumpus cause I did his nails
13-10-2019T20:12:51,Ordithus,Are they pretty
13-10-2019T20:13:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I clipped them you know that right
13-10-2019T20:13:14,Ordithus,Yes yes
13-10-2019T20:13:33,Ordithus,"Though it would be funny, I don't think it would work with retractable claws"
13-10-2019T20:13:35,SpazztasticKiwi,dork got one hung in some fabric batting
13-10-2019T20:13:36,Ordithus,To paint them
13-10-2019T20:14:13,SpazztasticKiwi,he’s a boy
13-10-2019T20:14:15,Ordithus,Does he have a scratching thingamajig?
13-10-2019T20:14:22,SpazztasticKiwi,yes
13-10-2019T20:14:25,SpazztasticKiwi,yes he does
13-10-2019T20:14:40,Ordithus,Does he use it
13-10-2019T20:14:42,SpazztasticKiwi,hence the need to do his nails
13-10-2019T20:15:45,Ordithus,grump cat
13-10-2019T20:16:00,SpazztasticKiwi,“I must sharpen my talons for the hunt!”
13-10-2019T20:16:16,SpazztasticKiwi,also Bagheera: “mom hold me the dogs are inside”
13-10-2019T20:52:31,AspiringNoodle,Me: *wants to go see movie*
