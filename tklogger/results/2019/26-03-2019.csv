26-03-2019T01:56:14,iliar,"For some reason, I thought you didn't like Nora."
26-03-2019T01:56:59,Bgrmystr2,"Not sure why you would think that, but he has mentioned he called his PC nora and the tablets Reni"
26-03-2019T02:06:29,iliar,"I live in a different time zone. Therefore, I skip most chat conversations."
26-03-2019T02:07:43,Bgrmystr2,unfortunate. I am able to read just about most all chat even when I'm unavailable or sleeping. :)
26-03-2019T02:23:52,Twokinds,I like Nora!
26-03-2019T02:23:57,Twokinds,Why wouldn't I?

26-03-2019T03:36:06,iliar,Just wondering. What were you looking for?
26-03-2019T03:38:08,Twokinds,Someone asked me what my most complicated sktech suggestion was.

26-03-2019T03:39:47,Bgrmystr2,..now I wanna know what it was xD
26-03-2019T03:40:41,Dadrobit,I'm guessing if it's in terms of visual complexity that it might have been Maddie using the table of summoning?
26-03-2019T03:41:03,Bgrmystr2,"maybe. That one was a lot of work, I remember."
26-03-2019T03:41:14,iliar,Maybe something with dragons or many characters
26-03-2019T03:42:04,Dadrobit,"And some random ones are just super detailed for a ""sketch"""
26-03-2019T03:42:48,iliar,"Oh, right ""Maddie using the table of summoning"" looks hard"
