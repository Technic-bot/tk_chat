07-02-2019T21:43:25,Bgrmystr2,"I don't have any of the old pages, I literally went to the katbox page and went to the links from there"
07-02-2019T21:43:27,SageSaga,and Mihari is working on the design stuff next week

07-02-2019T21:44:04,Rosscoe,evenings@
07-02-2019T21:44:09,SageSaga,thats like the opposite of what everyone else seems to do Bgr
07-02-2019T21:44:10,ShadowSoap,"Evening, Ross"
07-02-2019T21:44:16,Ordithus,"Sage, cool if I link to the filler you made for uberquest?"
07-02-2019T21:44:16,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi ross
07-02-2019T21:44:36,SageSaga,the Katbox main page barely ever gets constant hits- while the comic pages themselves are mostly direct
07-02-2019T21:44:37,Rosscoe,"I got a few moments, lets see what Nekonny and Sage are onto today"
07-02-2019T21:44:44,Bgrmystr2,Dunno why anyone needs more than one link. I just open the katbox primary page because I read more than half of them.
07-02-2019T21:44:52,neropan,eya naaaans
07-02-2019T21:44:54,Rosscoe,And Nero is doing something something I dunno what yet
07-02-2019T21:45:00,SageSaga,man this looks like im drawing Kaylin
07-02-2019T21:45:18,Rosscoe,Sharing hair styles?
07-02-2019T21:45:24,Bgrmystr2,I just end up opening the main page and open the other.. what. 10 comics or so? in new tabs in one go.
07-02-2019T21:45:31,SageSaga,their hair styles are similar
07-02-2019T21:45:34,ShineyFighter,"hey Tom, random question but you ever planing on any conventions in the UK? :o"
07-02-2019T21:45:49,ShineyFighter,thought id ask :3
07-02-2019T21:46:02,Nekonny,I'm having trouble finding the UQ filler?
07-02-2019T21:46:02,Mihari,"Probably not unless it was fully paid by someone else, even then..."
07-02-2019T21:46:14,Bgrmystr2,"I bet most people don't actually read much more than 1 or 2 comics, that's why they only bookmark the one they read lol"
07-02-2019T21:46:16,Mihari,Then you're not looking hard enough Nekonny.
07-02-2019T21:46:27,Tharkis,"cons are expensive, adding international travel makes them a money losing proposition unfortunately"
07-02-2019T21:46:29,ThingsAreMoving,Uk conventions would include a lot of investment in accomodation
07-02-2019T21:46:57,Tharkis,going to a con as an attendee for fun and traveling is one thing
07-02-2019T21:47:04,SageSaga,Ron
07-02-2019T21:47:05,SageSaga,wth
07-02-2019T21:47:07,Tharkis,but tryign to do it as a vendor is totally diff
07-02-2019T21:47:08,Bgrmystr2,so..
07-02-2019T21:47:09,MrEase,"also sorry about the comment on patreon, I didn't expect that to blow up that much"
07-02-2019T21:47:15,Bgrmystr2,the link ord sent me crashed my browser.
07-02-2019T21:47:16,Bgrmystr2,so that's cool
07-02-2019T21:47:18,SageSaga,Trying going to the actual site Ron
07-02-2019T21:47:24,ThingsAreMoving,I guess the only realistic option would be a vacation in europe with attending some cons
07-02-2019T21:47:40,Ordithus,"Sorry bgr, get a better browser?"
07-02-2019T21:48:07,Bgrmystr2,I have two. It's not like this hasn't happened in others as well

07-02-2019T21:51:16,Ordithus,I didn't know it was possible for her to be even more adorable

07-02-2019T21:51:20,qwe304,"what technical issue are you having, bgr?"
07-02-2019T21:51:21,Bgrmystr2,he's already got.. I think a 970
07-02-2019T21:51:37,HeresyArtStream,My brother has a 970. It's still a pretty capable card.
07-02-2019T21:51:44,CrRAR,yerp
07-02-2019T21:51:56,Bgrmystr2,"Oh, I went to a link ord sent me on the katbox site and it gave me a blank white page, so I tried to close the tab and it crashed the browser."

07-02-2019T21:52:16,Ordithus,It was to the new uberquest page

07-02-2019T21:52:22,Bgrmystr2,"wb to you and your pizzer, things"

07-02-2019T21:52:37,ThingsAreMoving,I've bought a 1070 GTX from MSI bout 2 years ago
07-02-2019T21:52:38,HeresyArtStream,The new PSU would be almost entirely a vanity thing since my current PSU is already pretty good.
07-02-2019T21:52:39,Bgrmystr2,haha sure did
07-02-2019T21:52:45,qwe304,rx480 can be found for dirt cheap used and can play pretty much anything @1080p
07-02-2019T21:52:51,ThingsAreMoving,best investment in quite a while

07-02-2019T21:55:09,CrRAR,"Being a West Basitin, they only judge you by how many fishies you can catch a day."
07-02-2019T21:55:12,qwe304,@dadrobit you can get 10-15% more performance from it by undervolting it and setting a more agressive fan curve
07-02-2019T21:55:36,MarvTheHugPharaoh,It's snowing
07-02-2019T21:55:41,Dadrobit,FX 8350 here. They're down to like $60 bucks now.

07-02-2019T22:47:50,CrRAR,ow my heart
07-02-2019T22:47:54,CrRAR,That Maddie face
07-02-2019T22:47:57,Ordithus,Sleep isn't an acceptable sacrifice
07-02-2019T22:48:17,Bgrmystr2,"if you have to sacrifice sleep, you lifing wrong."
07-02-2019T22:48:26,Bgrmystr2,probably.
07-02-2019T22:48:37,Ordithus,"So, we agree"
07-02-2019T22:49:35,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-LauraCry: Maddie...
07-02-2019T22:49:39,Bgrmystr2,Well yeah on one sacrifice.

07-02-2019T22:49:44,Corinthian,"Aww, Maddie's crying! :("
07-02-2019T22:49:47,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm popping in and out. And it‚Äôs not like my involvement has been as it used to anyway - I 90% lurk anymore
07-02-2019T22:50:29,Mippy,Poor middy
07-02-2019T22:53:08,Samoo2001,The speed at which twokinds draws litterally blows my mind
07-02-2019T22:53:48,LOGANWOLF,This is getting deep :ptv-confused:
07-02-2019T22:53:52,Bgrmystr2,"when you focus on speed rather than quality, your quality still improves and your speed also increases. :)"
07-02-2019T22:54:27,Ordithus,I do expect his pace has increased thanks to the sunday streams
07-02-2019T22:54:51,Samoo2001,Its just insane how well his workflow is
07-02-2019T22:54:59,Bgrmystr2,and he's still behind
07-02-2019T22:55:07,Bgrmystr2,maybe not now but
07-02-2019T22:55:12,Bgrmystr2,has been within recent months.
07-02-2019T22:55:21,Bgrmystr2,takes on so much lol
07-02-2019T22:55:26,Samoo2001,What do you mean behind?
07-02-2019T22:55:44,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-floAAA: so many things work work work
07-02-2019T22:55:55,Bgrmystr2,a couple months back he had like 5 or 6 nora cards he hadn't finished yet
07-02-2019T22:55:58,Bgrmystr2,or somesuch
07-02-2019T22:56:23,qwe304,... why does @ordithus have two of the mod icons on his name? lol
07-02-2019T22:56:24,Bgrmystr2,and he wasn't able to keep up the wednesday stream for the comic page each week either
07-02-2019T22:56:30,Bgrmystr2,duh
07-02-2019T22:56:30,Bgrmystr2,cuz he's a supermod
07-02-2019T22:56:37,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-power:
07-02-2019T22:56:59,qwe304,in the user list he has two XD
07-02-2019T22:57:07,Bgrmystr2,yeah that's not new
07-02-2019T22:57:10,Ordithus,(actually it's just a glitch... one of those shields should be a $)
07-02-2019T22:57:17,Bgrmystr2,yeah it doesn't show the $
07-02-2019T22:57:21,Bgrmystr2,it's been that way for months now
07-02-2019T22:57:26,Ordithus,Picarto can't handle it when someone is a subscriber and something else
07-02-2019T22:57:28,Bgrmystr2,probably more than a year I'd say
07-02-2019T22:58:03,Garrettb1425,i see both
07-02-2019T22:58:27,Bgrmystr2,"well of course, Ord can't be supermod everywhere all the time"
07-02-2019T22:58:30,Bgrmystr2,it's exausting
07-02-2019T22:59:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Picarto can‚Äôt multitask. How do you expect it to process when someone else is?
07-02-2019T22:59:21,SageSaga,there we go
07-02-2019T22:59:33,Ordithus,"Fantastic work, Sage!  Looks incredible"
07-02-2019T23:01:02,Bgrmystr2,yeh it looked great
07-02-2019T23:01:32,Nekonny,"I missed the end result, bt it was lookin gnice"

07-02-2019T23:09:16,Nekonny,"Oh, I havent really announced it yet"
07-02-2019T23:09:26,Nekonny,but I finally updated the store with new books:
07-02-2019T23:09:29,Nekonny,https://nekonny.com/store.html

07-02-2019T23:12:13,Combak,Hey all!
07-02-2019T23:12:43,Ordithus,Hi Combak
07-02-2019T23:12:56,CrRAR,evenin combak
07-02-2019T23:13:21,qwe304,do you have any different benchmarks?
07-02-2019T23:14:21,Combak,"Hi Ord, CrRAR."
07-02-2019T23:15:44,ElvenHunter84,"Hey, Tom. Would you be willing to draw like a 6 frame gif during the Sunday Sketch stream if I split it up over several weeks of suggestions? Like 2 frames every couple weeks?"
07-02-2019T23:16:07,Combak,"Elven, the better question would be if people would vote for it."
07-02-2019T23:16:12,qwe304,@ElvenHunter84 I doubt that you could manage to get it picked multiple weeks
07-02-2019T23:16:19,Bgrmystr2,people would need to vote for it yeah
07-02-2019T23:16:35,w0lfmare,Yeah what everyone said
07-02-2019T23:16:36,ElvenHunter84,That does seem to be a flaw in my plan
07-02-2019T23:16:41,Bgrmystr2,and people are not fans of stuff that was already suggested.
07-02-2019T23:16:41,InTheLionsDen,He may be hoping for multiple Tom's picks.
07-02-2019T23:16:45,Bgrmystr2,so that's another problem
07-02-2019T23:17:18,Bgrmystr2,what kind of gif would it even be
07-02-2019T23:17:27,Bgrmystr2,because people make gifs of tom's stuff all the time
07-02-2019T23:17:33,Bgrmystr2,"rudimentary, but gifs nonetheless."
07-02-2019T23:17:37,Combak,That's already won Bgr. Important distinction.
07-02-2019T23:17:48,ElvenHunter84,True. Maybe then it would have to be a longer gif
07-02-2019T23:17:58,Bgrmystr2,..yeah true combak
07-02-2019T23:18:47,Mippy,@Nekonny Dose the shop ship to Canada?
07-02-2019T23:19:09,ElvenHunter84,"I was just wondering more if Tom would be willing to do something like that. He could probably easily knock something like that out in like 2 hours, so he could even draw it all offstream as a tom pick one week"
07-02-2019T23:19:12,Ordithus,":ptv-angry: Picarto, stop freezing Nero stream!"
07-02-2019T23:19:17,Ordithus,So rude
