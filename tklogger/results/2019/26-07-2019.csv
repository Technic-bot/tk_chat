26-07-2019T00:04:07,SpazztasticKiwi,combine
26-07-2019T00:04:07,Dadrobit,I think maybe the problem is I think too much?

26-07-2019T00:14:16,MarvTheHugPharaoh,bread is serious business
26-07-2019T00:14:16,Ordithus,Brutus the Baker (of towns)
26-07-2019T00:14:44,Sclimshady,Bred brings the rise and fall of civilizations
26-07-2019T00:15:27,FloofyCat,I dun get it
26-07-2019T00:15:54,Ordithus,Though who was it that tried making fried snep?  Will we ever know?!
26-07-2019T00:16:17,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Brutus would not approve
26-07-2019T00:16:19,Sclimshady,Fried snep!!!? unacceptable!!!!
26-07-2019T00:16:23,Dadrobit,Clovis almost certainly.
26-07-2019T00:16:25,Bgrmystr2,didn't all of them try?
26-07-2019T00:16:30,Bgrmystr2,at the same time
26-07-2019T00:17:02,Ordithus,Only one made the shot

26-07-2019T00:17:07,Bgrmystr2,hm okay
26-07-2019T00:17:16,Sclimshady,We can just agree that Brutus wasn't involved
26-07-2019T00:17:16,Dadrobit,Tbh*
26-07-2019T00:17:26,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Trace was a master fry cook

26-07-2019T02:03:37,BadFoMo,"The music that's playing now, are they Midi tracks?"

26-07-2019T02:04:33,BadFoMo,"Well, the last one sounded like it."

26-07-2019T02:04:45,BadFoMo,Good night.
26-07-2019T02:04:49,Cizi,Do you have a link to Maty's work on the top left Sage?
26-07-2019T02:04:52,SageSaga,uhhh- they are probably Midi's
26-07-2019T02:05:06,BadFoMo,Cool.
26-07-2019T02:05:27,BadFoMo,What are they from?
26-07-2019T02:05:31,SageSaga,Maty doesnt have a place where she posts often anymore-  she does stream on rare occasions -
26-07-2019T02:05:54,SageSaga,current one is from Chrono Trigger
26-07-2019T02:06:08,BadFoMo,Thanks.
26-07-2019T02:06:22,SageSaga,np- previous ones were from Legend of Mana
26-07-2019T02:06:32,BadFoMo,Thanks again.
26-07-2019T02:06:43,Sclimshady,Night Risque
26-07-2019T02:08:10,Yevni,"Heya doods, how goes it tonight?"
26-07-2019T02:08:18,SageSaga,yo
26-07-2019T02:08:20,Cizi,"Aww shame, the bouncing girl looks great."
26-07-2019T02:08:28,BadFoMo,I'm fine. You.
26-07-2019T02:08:40,SageSaga,Cizi - i think she goes by matypup on some places
26-07-2019T02:08:45,BadFoMo,*?
26-07-2019T02:08:46,Sclimshady,"Nm,  tired but i like art"
26-07-2019T02:09:07,SageSaga,you might be able to find some of her work online on like deviant art or newgrounds
26-07-2019T02:09:15,Yevni,Yoyos are cool. Made it to Canada in 2 days on motorcycle. 1000 miles and my body still aches after being off since noon rip.
26-07-2019T02:10:17,Yevni,LTX19 Tomorrow thoughhhh
26-07-2019T02:10:33,SageSaga,i wish i could go to that
26-07-2019T02:10:40,BadFoMo,I remember Newgrounds. That was one of my top sites to visit back in the day.
26-07-2019T02:10:47,BadFoMo,LTX19?
26-07-2019T02:10:56,Yevni,Anything in particular you wanted to see there?
26-07-2019T02:10:56,SageSaga,Linus Tech Expo
26-07-2019T02:11:02,Yevni,LTX /\
26-07-2019T02:11:05,BadFoMo,Thanks.
26-07-2019T02:11:15,SageSaga,i wanted to use my secret technique to throw a case and win a graphics card
26-07-2019T02:11:26,Yevni,Oh do tell. I gotta win
26-07-2019T02:11:27,BadFoMo,...Wat?
26-07-2019T02:11:44,Yevni,I'll make it worth your while in the commission haha
26-07-2019T02:11:51,Yevni,*if I win
26-07-2019T02:12:14,SageSaga,its all about finding the center of gravity to keep control of the case- and using either the kamakazi throw or a more safe heft with my incredible strength
26-07-2019T02:12:27,Yevni,@badfomo there's a computer case throwing competition
26-07-2019T02:12:51,Yevni,SageSwol confirmed
26-07-2019T02:13:08,BadFoMo,"...Why? I mean, why a computer case?"
26-07-2019T02:13:34,Bgrmystr2,Because it's a tech expo and is all about computers and hardware?
26-07-2019T02:13:41,SageSaga,a kamakazi throw with a case would be like a german suplex  so you throw your whole weight into it in an arcing direction and transfer as much of that into the case- and hope you dont break yourself
26-07-2019T02:14:17,Yevni,I already broke myself from the bike ride haha
26-07-2019T02:14:46,SageSaga,you also look mentally deranged doing it- but theres a lot of energy in it
26-07-2019T02:15:17,SageSaga,an insensitive person might even call it retard strength- but we would never do that
26-07-2019T02:15:46,BadFoMo,We wouldn't?
26-07-2019T02:15:57,Yevni,"Lmao, if it works, look who wins the card"
26-07-2019T02:15:58,SageSaga,nope- we are better than that
26-07-2019T02:16:23,SageSaga,"""Ha! You all said it was a retarded idea! Well who has the RTX 2080TI?!"""
26-07-2019T02:16:32,Yevni,HAHA
26-07-2019T02:16:33,SageSaga,"""Ok - take me to the hospital now"""
26-07-2019T02:16:35,BadFoMo,So we'd call it 'Ed Strangth'?
26-07-2019T02:16:37,Mihari,Me?
26-07-2019T02:16:43,SageSaga,"""He'll never walk again"""
26-07-2019T02:16:48,Yevni,I'd just drink it off since I can here lmao
26-07-2019T02:17:45,Yevni,Best part is a decent bar is in the same building as my hostel
26-07-2019T02:18:25,Yevni,And my green backs are worth more here mwahahaha
26-07-2019T02:18:43,SageSaga,:P
26-07-2019T02:19:40,Yevni,OH
26-07-2019T02:19:57,Yevni,I also brought Kaylin over the border with
26-07-2019T02:20:16,SageSaga,There are a few over the boarder already :P
26-07-2019T02:20:21,Yevni,"good clean clothes bag, lmao"
26-07-2019T02:20:41,Yevni,YEAH but did any of them ride a motorcycle for 1000 miles? Noooo
26-07-2019T02:20:49,SageSaga,no that is true
26-07-2019T02:20:56,SageSaga,she is the most well traveled
26-07-2019T02:21:10,Yevni,not even passport
26-07-2019T02:21:26,Yevni,She is the passport
26-07-2019T02:21:35,SageSaga,well to be fair- i dont think any country recognizes Elves as citizens
26-07-2019T02:22:02,Yevni,What about the Elvish? :thonk:
26-07-2019T02:23:30,SageSaga,"""haha!  You dont have any rights here elf!"" ""Does that mean i dont have to obey your human laws?"" ""O_O"""
26-07-2019T02:24:34,Yevni,"Lmao. Anyway I'm gonna call it for the night. That glove sketch from last week or a few weeks weeks ago (idk), is dope. Now I can't wait for the peakerrrrs"
26-07-2019T02:24:57,BadFoMo,Bye/Goodnight?
26-07-2019T02:25:06,Sclimshady,Night Yevni
26-07-2019T02:25:07,Yevni,"Yes, nini lmao"
26-07-2019T02:25:09,BadFoMo,*Good night
26-07-2019T02:25:25,SageSaga,XD
26-07-2019T02:25:28,SageSaga,take care sleep well
26-07-2019T02:25:58,Yevni,The maple syrup beds make it a breeze
26-07-2019T02:26:29,Sclimshady,That sounds sticky
26-07-2019T02:34:06,SageSaga,and im done!
26-07-2019T02:34:32,Sclimshady,Looks Great Sage! :heart:
26-07-2019T02:34:37,SageSaga,ty
26-07-2019T02:34:40,BadFoMo,Cool.
26-07-2019T02:34:54,SageSaga,y'all take care! I'll be back in 11 hours and 25 minutes to color it
26-07-2019T02:35:01,BadFoMo,Bye.
26-07-2019T02:35:04,Sclimshady,Ill be counting
26-07-2019T02:35:13,Sclimshady,Night Sage o/
26-07-2019T02:35:30,sunblaze,bye
26-07-2019T02:35:59,SageSaga,take care Sunblaze!
26-07-2019T02:36:03,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Awesome work sage, thanks for the streamu"
26-07-2019T02:36:18,sunblaze,quite a challenge in this weather. but I'll try :D
26-07-2019T02:36:33,SageSaga,stay safe? o_o
26-07-2019T02:37:03,sunblaze,stay hydrated is good advise
26-07-2019T02:37:06,sunblaze,for everyone!
26-07-2019T02:37:20,SageSaga,oh right-
26-07-2019T02:37:26,SageSaga,you have the heat wave?
26-07-2019T02:37:41,SageSaga,highest temps ever all over europe
26-07-2019T02:37:51,sunblaze,"it ""should"" be less then the last 2 days which were 39-40 °C"
26-07-2019T02:38:03,SageSaga,yikes
26-07-2019T02:38:07,sunblaze,only 33 predicted today
26-07-2019T02:38:31,sunblaze,I know why I love snow and frost and ice
26-07-2019T02:38:33,SageSaga,thats still hot for anyone who doesnt have AC
26-07-2019T02:38:38,sunblaze,summer is just mehhhh
26-07-2019T02:38:47,sunblaze,thats right
26-07-2019T02:39:23,SageSaga,in the summer it is often around 32-34c here
26-07-2019T02:39:40,SageSaga,but everyone has AC units- heck i have my own stand alone unit to keep it even cooler in my room
26-07-2019T02:39:48,SageSaga,(also great for my PC XD)
26-07-2019T02:40:04,sunblaze,I dislike them
26-07-2019T02:40:14,sunblaze,I get AC'd all day at work
26-07-2019T02:40:29,sunblaze,getting one at home would just make me more sick :(
26-07-2019T02:40:45,SageSaga,i like keeping my work space at 23.3c
26-07-2019T02:41:00,sunblaze,luckily ther are only like 10 days a year that get this disturbing
26-07-2019T02:41:06,sunblaze,sadly some are right now :P
26-07-2019T02:41:33,Sclimshady,Tats oddly specific Sage
26-07-2019T02:42:00,SageSaga,only because im from the US and we use Fahrenheit
26-07-2019T02:42:14,SageSaga,so 74f is 23.3333333c
26-07-2019T02:43:18,Sclimshady,"""If my room is .1 degree off i will flip"""
26-07-2019T02:43:35,SageSaga,the difference in 1c is significant - but i can usually tell the difference of 2 degrees F
26-07-2019T02:44:27,SageSaga,which is like a .5c difference
26-07-2019T02:44:44,SageSaga,depending on where you are at on the scale
26-07-2019T02:44:48,Sclimshady,I am not that capable
26-07-2019T02:45:36,SageSaga,anything over 75 and i feel a bit warm - anything lower than 72 and it's a tad chilly but im ok with that
26-07-2019T02:45:49,sunblaze,I measure tmperature as -10°C and less = :ptv-excited:
26-07-2019T02:46:03,sunblaze,+ 28 and above = :ptv-whiny:
26-07-2019T02:46:14,sunblaze,everything between = :ptv-unimpressed:
26-07-2019T02:46:20,SageSaga,once ya hit bellow 45f im kinda too cold and gotta wear a jacket
26-07-2019T02:46:26,Sclimshady,Temps that low are only nice if it's snowing
26-07-2019T02:46:51,Sclimshady,Going for a drive in a snowstorm is super zen
26-07-2019T02:46:54,SageSaga,45f is a little over 7c
26-07-2019T02:47:08,SageSaga,and super dangerous
26-07-2019T02:47:13,SageSaga,snow sucks
26-07-2019T02:47:22,sunblaze,thats what good tires are for
26-07-2019T02:47:28,SageSaga,give me a nice cool breezy cloud covered day
26-07-2019T02:47:30,Sclimshady,"Yeah, i drive in 4wd and super slow"
26-07-2019T02:48:15,SageSaga,snow around here often means power outages
26-07-2019T02:48:44,sunblaze,yeah I have seen the us powergrid
26-07-2019T02:48:48,sunblaze,*shudders*
26-07-2019T02:49:05,SageSaga,it's held together by oposums
26-07-2019T02:49:05,sunblaze,here its just slippery road and lots of dented cars.
26-07-2019T02:49:19,Sclimshady,I havent had that problem.  It usually takes several hours to see the plows but that means more solo time for me
26-07-2019T02:49:41,sunblaze,was in frisco in 2013. I swear the powergrid looked JSUT the same as india in 2008
26-07-2019T02:49:42,SageSaga,"""Oh no! Thunder! It'll scare the opossums and we'll lose power!"""
26-07-2019T02:50:00,sunblaze,I fail to comprehend how the US managed that
26-07-2019T02:50:09,SageSaga,oh it was easy
26-07-2019T02:50:24,Sclimshady,Bad management and people wanting easy money
26-07-2019T02:50:41,SageSaga,the government gave a bunch of money to companies to run lines- and they did it as cheap as they could to keep as much money
26-07-2019T02:50:51,SageSaga,and since then its just been patch after patch after patch-
26-07-2019T02:50:58,SageSaga,instead of a full replacement
26-07-2019T02:51:02,sunblaze,yah for exploiting capitalism!
26-07-2019T02:51:11,Sclimshady,Amputation? have a bandaid!
26-07-2019T02:52:21,SageSaga,"""This man needs surgery!"" ""Whoa now- surgery is expensive! Try a bandaid first, if that doesnt do it THEN he can have surgery!"" *Hours later* ""So how-"" ""He's dead"""
26-07-2019T02:52:44,sunblaze,sadly thats not even made up :(
26-07-2019T02:53:17,Sclimshady,"""He's only mostly dead!"" ""Doctor, he has no blood"""
26-07-2019T02:54:09,SageSaga,I think the best example of being screwed by capitalism also shows that they screwed up because if they had done the right thing- they would now be super rich-
26-07-2019T02:54:28,SageSaga,The government gave out a ton of money to people to lay fiber optic cables for internet
26-07-2019T02:54:51,sunblaze,OTHER companies I guess?
26-07-2019T02:54:55,SageSaga,and they instead laid more copper cables instead and kept the extra money
26-07-2019T02:55:34,Sclimshady,"That should honestly be illigal and probably is, but nothing will happen"
26-07-2019T02:55:38,sunblaze,and be aware we have the same preoblem. concerning the interwebs germany is third world as well.
26-07-2019T02:55:40,SageSaga,NOW they wish they had created the fiber optic infrastructure because its what everyone wants now and is super easy to maintain
26-07-2019T02:55:40,sunblaze,it sucks
26-07-2019T02:55:55,sunblaze,yeah I can see that
26-07-2019T02:56:45,SageSaga,i think an economist did a study on it and found that if they hadnt pocketed the money and instead did it they would have now made 10x the profit of what they pocketed every year and more
26-07-2019T02:57:14,sunblaze,yes but short therm wins buff your shares more
26-07-2019T02:57:27,sunblaze,long time investmant is not popular in stock amrkets
26-07-2019T02:57:45,SageSaga,"""Remember how we took that 100 dollars?"" ""Yeah?"" ""Well if we had bought that thing- we would be making a thousand dollars a day more"" ""Wait- what?"""
26-07-2019T03:09:20,sunblaze,anyway I'll be gone as well
26-07-2019T03:09:22,sunblaze,take care
26-07-2019T03:21:48,BadFoMo,Bye.
26-07-2019T03:28:22,DarthRexKing,Goodnight!
26-07-2019T03:58:02,Dadrobit,Goddamnit. Fuckin kids TP'd a resident's house.... Again.... And this is the first I'm hearing of this so now it's all on me...
26-07-2019T03:58:37,Bgrmystr2,how exactly is it on you if you didn't know about it till now? You supposed to read people's minds or some bullshit?
26-07-2019T03:59:55,Dadrobit,"The kids have always done it on the weekends before, so it was always taken on by the weekend dude. Kids threw a curve ball and did it on a Friday, so now I need to deal with it this time."
26-07-2019T04:00:13,Bgrmystr2,ah okay
26-07-2019T04:00:19,Bgrmystr2,godspeed
26-07-2019T04:01:13,Dadrobit,"Just makes the whole security firm look bad when a resident calls and tells his story for the umpteenth time, and the responding supervisor says, ""what now? You've been TP'd before?"""
26-07-2019T04:01:42,Dadrobit,Looks like the left hand doesn't know what the right is doing... Which it doesn't...
26-07-2019T04:02:58,Dadrobit,"Also, it's literally not even in my jurisdiction. Should have gone to the supervisor in charge of that site, but the resident called me because he liked me more..."
26-07-2019T04:04:36,Dadrobit,So the last hour+ was spent driving around looking for kids that scampered off home probably before I could even get in my truck to head over.

26-07-2019T09:49:30,AspiringNoodle,Was reading Sage's rant about ISPs
26-07-2019T09:49:39,AspiringNoodle,It made me happy :ptv-hearts:
26-07-2019T09:50:27,AspiringNoodle,"What would make me even happier is if the government required ISPs to lay fiber optic cable, but they have to pay for it out of pocket, and if they increase costs for consumers, they'd be in legal trouble :P"

26-07-2019T10:22:43,IronHorseComics,"he could just move to my town and pick a house that has connection to EPB's fiber optics, it's owned by the city"
26-07-2019T10:31:45,AspiringNoodle,The dream...
26-07-2019T10:32:38,IronHorseComics,Iit's also cheaper to live in Tennessee than

26-07-2019T11:10:36,CrimsonQuill,At least we'll have an abundance of firewood.
26-07-2019T11:10:37,AspiringNoodle,Lewd is love
26-07-2019T11:10:39,AspiringNoodle,Lewd is life
26-07-2019T11:10:48,CrimsonQuill,I do not go for lewd.
26-07-2019T11:10:49,AspiringNoodle,"In some cases, literally :ptv-snicker:"
26-07-2019T11:11:04,CrimsonQuill,I have been poisoned by lewd.
26-07-2019T11:11:22,AspiringNoodle,One must be careful of fictional lewd
26-07-2019T11:11:22,CrimsonQuill,*glares at internet thumbnails*
26-07-2019T11:11:56,AspiringNoodle,For it may become more tantalizing and titillating than real lewd.
26-07-2019T11:12:34,TerraTheWizard,bot dead?

26-07-2019T11:41:24,AspiringNoodle,Yeah
26-07-2019T11:41:29,AspiringNoodle,I'm thinking more along the lines of:
26-07-2019T11:41:40,AspiringNoodle,"Pre-Amnesia Trace: ""KILL ALL KEIDRAN."""
26-07-2019T11:41:59,AspiringNoodle,"Post-Amnesia Trace: ""What name should I give my half-human, half-keidran unborn child..."""

26-07-2019T11:48:17,IronHorseComics,artillery's still faster than magic
26-07-2019T11:48:31,AspiringNoodle,You need to think more like FMA did :P
26-07-2019T11:48:40,IronHorseComics,I'm thinking like Gate
26-07-2019T11:48:44,IronHorseComics,more realistic
26-07-2019T11:49:01,IronHorseComics,even if it's overselling the abilities of the JSDF
26-07-2019T11:49:06,AspiringNoodle,"I'm in the camp where if a world has both tech and magic, magic will likely take precedence"
26-07-2019T11:49:22,AspiringNoodle,And tech will excel in areas where magic cannot really do anything
26-07-2019T11:49:31,IronHorseComics,"like being really, really fast"
26-07-2019T12:21:16,AspiringNoodle,Lost My Sanity killed Nokia 3310 in Dark Souls 3

26-07-2019T12:33:11,AspiringNoodle,I lost it :joy:
26-07-2019T13:07:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Sage actually still here
26-07-2019T13:20:42,SpazztasticKiwi,that’s a no then
26-07-2019T13:27:12,SpazztasticKiwi,I see in the birthday remake Trace is shorter than Tom - there’s some fun sized guys in this comic
26-07-2019T13:56:26,BadFoMo,Yo.
26-07-2019T13:58:46,BadFoMo,Sage has begun the purge! Run!
26-07-2019T14:00:45,BadFoMo,Yo. ...Again.
26-07-2019T14:00:54,SageSaga,yo
26-07-2019T14:03:20,CatzArt,hiya everyone
26-07-2019T14:04:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Sage yea
26-07-2019T14:04:00,SageSaga,howdy Catz
26-07-2019T14:04:03,SageSaga,yo Kiwi
26-07-2019T14:04:13,SpazztasticKiwi,I gots a question for you
26-07-2019T14:04:18,SageSaga,?
26-07-2019T14:04:27,SpazztasticKiwi,what would you give a friend who’s getting married
26-07-2019T14:04:49,SageSaga,something free
26-07-2019T14:05:08,SpazztasticKiwi,if I roll my eyes any harder I’ll see the back of my spine
26-07-2019T14:05:18,SageSaga,ok i can do one better
26-07-2019T14:05:22,SageSaga,My time
26-07-2019T14:05:57,SpazztasticKiwi,well lookin there - those vertebrae sure are in wonderous shape
26-07-2019T14:06:03,SpazztasticKiwi,I was considering along the lines of a gift basket
26-07-2019T14:06:29,SageSaga,do they have a gift registry?
26-07-2019T14:06:50,SpazztasticKiwi,that’s be helpful yeah but I haven’t seen one
26-07-2019T14:07:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"some flowers on the side, bath bombs, a restaurant gift card.."
26-07-2019T14:07:20,SageSaga,bathbombs are only good if they have a bath
26-07-2019T14:07:41,SpazztasticKiwi,well it’d be for the bride - she’s the one I’m friends with
26-07-2019T14:08:00,SpazztasticKiwi,well I’m close to the groom to it’s just I’ve known her longer
26-07-2019T14:08:08,SageSaga,do you know if they have a bath though? Lot of people around here only have showers
26-07-2019T14:08:16,SpazztasticKiwi,yea
26-07-2019T14:08:53,SpazztasticKiwi,in the house they’re in now but I don’t know if they’ve hammered down where they’re moving out to
26-07-2019T14:09:11,SpazztasticKiwi,if I had to guess though she’s gonna want an actual full bath
26-07-2019T14:09:34,SageSaga,see- most people set up a gift registry somewhere so people can buy them things they need for a new home and no one can buy the same thing twice
26-07-2019T14:10:41,SpazztasticKiwi,I work with her uncle and I’ll likely be seeing any one of them involved in the hullabaloo sometime before the big shabang
26-07-2019T14:11:06,SpazztasticKiwi,something will hit me maybe - and if not - basket
26-07-2019T14:11:19,SageSaga,well try to see if they have a registry- i know most of the weddings ive been to people prefer to get useful things
26-07-2019T14:11:42,Mippy,SAGE!
26-07-2019T14:11:51,SageSaga,as nice as some basket gifts can be- they are almost all temporary stuff
26-07-2019T14:11:53,SageSaga,yo Mippy
26-07-2019T14:11:56,SpazztasticKiwi,the groom worked on our car at one point and he mentioned he’d buy it from us if we’d sell it
26-07-2019T14:12:07,SpazztasticKiwi,(we’re getting a new car)
26-07-2019T14:12:24,SpazztasticKiwi,"but it’s a 2000 and, well, old"
26-07-2019T14:12:32,SageSaga,you cant just give a person a car- what are you? Mr Miyagi from Karate Kid?
26-07-2019T14:12:46,SpazztasticKiwi,he offered to buy it from us chill
26-07-2019T14:13:23,SpazztasticKiwi,but what he’s saying for it - I have microscopic car experience - doesn’t line up with what I’d take it for
26-07-2019T14:13:37,SageSaga,you brought it up while talking about what gift to give em- I can only assume you meant to imply that it might make a good gift
26-07-2019T14:14:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I mean I’m sure he’d like it but I don’t know if they’ve got a car lined up since they mentioned buying ours or not
26-07-2019T14:15:08,SpazztasticKiwi,"also, that’s be just for him really - it’d just be transportation for her"
26-07-2019T14:17:43,SpazztasticKiwi,oh God what am I gonna wear
26-07-2019T14:18:05,SageSaga,Slacks and a nice shirt with tie
26-07-2019T14:18:26,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m not sure if she has me down as a bridesmaid

26-07-2019T14:18:59,SageSaga,if you are a bridesmaid they usually have a set dress code for ya
26-07-2019T14:19:01,SpazztasticKiwi,and as smashing as I’d be in a tie I can’t do that if I’m a maid
26-07-2019T14:19:13,SageSaga,ive seen em do it before
26-07-2019T14:19:29,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t own a tie for obvious reasons
26-07-2019T14:19:43,SpazztasticKiwi,I got slacks tho
26-07-2019T14:19:44,SageSaga,though- ive also seen all the groomsmen in dresses and all the bridesmaids in suits
26-07-2019T14:19:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve seen those too
26-07-2019T14:20:13,SpazztasticKiwi,also saw one where they swapped “girl” and “guy” poses
26-07-2019T14:20:32,SageSaga,traditionally though- bridesmaids all either have a set dress to buy- or a set color of a dress and preferred type of dress
26-07-2019T14:20:59,SpazztasticKiwi,all the groomsmen had the smoochy faces and the bridesmaids were “cool story bro”
26-07-2019T14:21:14,AspiringNoodle,"Feh, weddings >_>"
26-07-2019T14:21:33,ZRO4825,"lol, I find the wedding talk amusing, cuz I *almost* asked you for Toyoko in a wedding dress for my request this month, Sage"

26-07-2019T14:31:14,SageSaga,they make it naughty
26-07-2019T14:31:20,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m talking just cleavage - not nips
26-07-2019T14:31:22,AspiringNoodle,"""No, not mine, you pervs, cute little birds."""
26-07-2019T14:31:26,SpazztasticKiwi,nips are further down
26-07-2019T14:31:29,SageSaga,thats why anime men have NO NIPPLES
26-07-2019T14:31:48,ZRO4825,"I mean, really, the male form shouldn't. They don't serve us any good! :P"
26-07-2019T14:31:49,SpazztasticKiwi,gotta censor the moobs
26-07-2019T14:32:12,AspiringNoodle,"For men, once you get so fat, they are no longer moobs"
26-07-2019T14:32:22,AspiringNoodle,"They are boobs, and should be subject to the same scrutiny as ladies xD"
26-07-2019T14:32:31,SageSaga,https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/920/570/58f.jpg Meme about anime men and nipples
26-07-2019T14:32:49,AspiringNoodle,LMAO
26-07-2019T14:32:53,SpazztasticKiwi,heh
26-07-2019T14:33:26,AspiringNoodle,"In the future, we shall genetically modify men so they have no nipples"
26-07-2019T14:33:41,SpazztasticKiwi,*Edna voice* “no nips!”
26-07-2019T14:33:51,AspiringNoodle,And the ripped dudes will suddenly become 10x hotter!
26-07-2019T14:34:32,SpazztasticKiwi,ripped dudes most often look like deformed croissants
26-07-2019T14:34:42,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-sleepy: blargleharble
26-07-2019T14:34:57,ZRO4825,"Mownin, Bgr!"
26-07-2019T14:34:59,AspiringNoodle,"Welcome to the world of the waking, yah dingus"
26-07-2019T14:35:02,Bgrmystr2,mornin
26-07-2019T14:35:17,AspiringNoodle,You missed a funny impromptu comedy session about censorship ;D
26-07-2019T14:35:21,Bgrmystr2,what did I do now
26-07-2019T14:35:25,Bgrmystr2,I read it
26-07-2019T14:35:26,AspiringNoodle,And Sage's subsequent cold-blooded murder of it ._.
26-07-2019T14:35:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’m a chest person but when it feels like rubbing your hands up a dull cheesegrater, it’s time to turn down the steroids"
26-07-2019T14:35:47,ZRO4825,"I highly approved of Sage's methods, as they gave us a name for the Wolfgirl."
26-07-2019T14:36:46,Bgrmystr2,Is this Sage's version of Katana tail?
26-07-2019T14:37:13,SpazztasticKiwi,"though as that stands, it’s a hobby and a job for some so 🤷🏻‍♀️"
26-07-2019T14:37:31,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s static tail
26-07-2019T14:37:36,SpazztasticKiwi,the lady boner
26-07-2019T14:37:37,FoxxTrotter,:cfoxxtrotter-SlyCool:
26-07-2019T14:37:41,SageSaga,She has floofy tail- its too floof to cut
26-07-2019T14:38:00,Bgrmystr2,"so if it wasn't AS floof as it was, it'd be katana tail. Got it."
26-07-2019T14:38:16,SpazztasticKiwi,she goes for a swim and comes out 10 pounds slimmer
26-07-2019T14:38:37,SpazztasticKiwi,or looking like a drowned rat
26-07-2019T14:38:48,Bgrmystr2,"she looks slimmer, not that she'd weigh less"
26-07-2019T14:38:58,Bgrmystr2,if anything she'd weigh more due to taking on water in the fur
26-07-2019T14:39:18,Bgrmystr2,water is heavy.
26-07-2019T14:39:35,SpazztasticKiwi,everything has weight
26-07-2019T14:39:53,SpazztasticKiwi,I got work in 10
26-07-2019T14:39:58,Bgrmystr2,cept space :P
26-07-2019T14:40:12,SpazztasticKiwi,space has cosmic weight
26-07-2019T14:40:17,SpazztasticKiwi,🥁
26-07-2019T14:40:23,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s out of this world
26-07-2019T14:40:31,BadFoMo,Boo.
26-07-2019T14:40:35,Bgrmystr2,":ptv-confused: As marty would say, That's heavy, Doc."
26-07-2019T14:41:06,ZRO4825,Must brush fluffy tail.
26-07-2019T14:41:11,SageSaga,everything is heavier in the future
26-07-2019T14:41:14,ZRO4825,"Also, why DOES she have tan lines, Sage? lol"
26-07-2019T14:41:24,SpazztasticKiwi,oh that’d probably bring out frizz
26-07-2019T14:41:51,SageSaga,because her other outfit his those straps and she likes hanging out in the sunny areas of town
26-07-2019T14:41:59,SpazztasticKiwi,better question why are the tan lines nearly mid boob
26-07-2019T14:42:11,SpazztasticKiwi,that’s an uncomfortable sunbathe suit
26-07-2019T14:42:27,ZRO4825,"Well, to be fair, she's a monstergirl. Her comfort level probably dwarfs our own, lol"
26-07-2019T14:42:57,BadFoMo,"I was thinking thoes were tan lines, or tattoos."
26-07-2019T14:43:32,SpazztasticKiwi,what kind of tattoo would that be? “X marks the spot”?
26-07-2019T14:44:49,SpazztasticKiwi,I must away now
26-07-2019T14:45:04,BadFoMo,Bye.

26-07-2019T14:52:50,AspiringNoodle,Their eyes... they're soulless
26-07-2019T14:52:58,AspiringNoodle,And now they're white! :ptv-shock:
26-07-2019T14:56:43,AspiringNoodle,She has such pretty blue eyes <3

26-07-2019T15:02:42,BadFoMo,Importing?
26-07-2019T15:02:58,SageSaga,setting up the new website
26-07-2019T15:03:03,BadFoMo,Cool!
26-07-2019T15:05:13,AspiringNoodle,"Lol, Fomo"
26-07-2019T15:08:47,Mihari,Is this the comic you used the line Sage or is that later? XD
26-07-2019T15:09:25,SageSaga,oof- which line?
26-07-2019T15:10:22,SageSaga,ive told ya a lot of future plans and ive got the script stuck in my head so you'll need to remind me which one
26-07-2019T15:11:35,SageSaga,ah no that's soon but not in this XD
26-07-2019T15:11:41,SageSaga,shes not around to hear that
26-07-2019T15:13:15,Mihari,Shame
26-07-2019T15:17:35,NextGenAnubisKid,Hello all!
26-07-2019T15:17:48,SageSaga,yo
26-07-2019T15:18:00,NextGenAnubisKid,Hey Sage ^^
26-07-2019T15:18:19,NextGenAnubisKid,How are y'all doing today?
26-07-2019T15:19:58,SageSaga,alright
26-07-2019T15:21:43,NextGenAnubisKid,That's good to hear ^^ The page is coming along rather lovely Sage ^^
26-07-2019T15:23:05,AspiringNoodle,Tali too cute >w<
26-07-2019T15:24:11,NextGenAnubisKid,Indeed ^^ I'm kicking myself in the pants for not having discovered Yosh! or AI sooner lol
26-07-2019T15:25:54,SageSaga,are ya a Twokinds reader?
26-07-2019T15:26:49,NextGenAnubisKid,Yeah I discovered you through Tom's streams. I myself only read TwoKinds a month ago XD
26-07-2019T15:26:53,NextGenAnubisKid,Binged it in two weeks.
26-07-2019T15:27:09,Bgrmystr2,"there is a 'recommended comics' on the front page of the Twokinds website, so there is that."
26-07-2019T15:27:10,NextGenAnubisKid,And am rather glad you multistream with Tom so I could discover your work as well ^^
26-07-2019T15:27:24,SageSaga,ok because i was gonna joke that if you have been reading twokinds you've had plenty of chances to learn about my comics XD
26-07-2019T15:27:37,NextGenAnubisKid,Yeah so there's no excuses for me :P
26-07-2019T15:27:44,NextGenAnubisKid,AI's gonna be my next comic binge
26-07-2019T15:27:51,NextGenAnubisKid,Or Yosh!
26-07-2019T15:28:01,NextGenAnubisKid,Though I think you mentioned last night that you recommend AI?
26-07-2019T15:28:02,SageSaga,i recommend AI over Yosh!
26-07-2019T15:28:22,NextGenAnubisKid,Gotcha
26-07-2019T15:28:32,SageSaga,its easier to get into- but if you want a long slog with fun characters and silly stuff- you can try Yosh
26-07-2019T15:28:39,MatyMaty,o/
26-07-2019T15:28:43,MatyMaty,Sage!
26-07-2019T15:28:43,BadFoMo,Yo.
26-07-2019T15:28:45,SageSaga,yo Maty!
26-07-2019T15:28:46,NextGenAnubisKid,Hallo Maty!
26-07-2019T15:28:46,MatyMaty,I got my book!
26-07-2019T15:28:51,BadFoMo,"...Also, back."
26-07-2019T15:28:51,SageSaga,Yay!
26-07-2019T15:28:55,NextGenAnubisKid,"Think I'm gonna read AI first, then move onto Yosh!"
26-07-2019T15:29:13,MatyMaty,"also, heya everyone!"
26-07-2019T15:29:26,NextGenAnubisKid,"And with me having bought all the necessary TTRPG manuals, I'm gonna need something else to throw my money at. Will likely be buying y'all's books next XD"
26-07-2019T15:30:55,SageSaga,my AI book is a bit more expensive than Tom's hard covers- but its because its got more pages and isnt printed en mass
26-07-2019T15:31:11,MatyMaty,It is amazing!
26-07-2019T15:31:19,NextGenAnubisKid,Makes sense. Will still likely buy after I read the comic online
26-07-2019T15:31:22,MatyMaty,it looks super professional
26-07-2019T15:31:30,NextGenAnubisKid,Or when I have disposable income again. One of the two :P
26-07-2019T15:32:00,SageSaga,looks like Tom doesnt have his hard covers for sale online o_O
26-07-2019T15:32:18,NextGenAnubisKid,"Welp, time to meet him at a con then :P"

26-07-2019T15:34:42,SageSaga,video card comes in Monday
26-07-2019T15:34:50,Bgrmystr2,the oversized hardcovers are on his shop page for $40
26-07-2019T15:35:04,AspiringNoodle,"As of right friggin' now, I'm looking at a 3700x with 2070 s."
26-07-2019T15:35:20,NextGenAnubisKid,Very nice ^^
26-07-2019T15:35:29,NextGenAnubisKid,I'm gonna be building my own rig come September I think
26-07-2019T15:35:32,SageSaga,im at the keenspot store-

26-07-2019T15:36:01,SageSaga,SUPER
26-07-2019T15:36:02,AspiringNoodle,SUUUUUUUUUUUUUPEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEER!
26-07-2019T15:36:06,SageSaga,beat ya
26-07-2019T15:36:07,NextGenAnubisKid,It's available for me
26-07-2019T15:36:08,NextGenAnubisKid,Huh
26-07-2019T15:36:10,Bgrmystr2,"when you go to the book page, there's a down arrow to select the format."
26-07-2019T15:36:11,Mihari,Ah.
26-07-2019T15:36:18,AspiringNoodle,I also used like 6x the letters :P
26-07-2019T15:36:29,Bgrmystr2,"every book has a down arrow for the manga, hardback, or digital"
26-07-2019T15:36:37,Mihari,Still can just say 2070 since they are replaced that sku
26-07-2019T15:36:42,Bgrmystr2,though book 1 manga edition is out of stock :thinking:
26-07-2019T15:36:44,SageSaga,ah
26-07-2019T15:36:50,SageSaga,wow - those are expensive
26-07-2019T15:36:51,AspiringNoodle,"Well, 2070's are still available for sale online"
26-07-2019T15:36:58,SageSaga,he sells em for 25 at the cons
26-07-2019T15:36:58,AspiringNoodle,So the distinction is still useful
26-07-2019T15:37:14,SageSaga,guess Keenspot takes a chunk
26-07-2019T15:37:30,Bgrmystr2,that's a pretty big chunk lol
26-07-2019T15:37:38,AspiringNoodle,"I was thinking of getting a 3900x, but unless I start streaming seriously, I can't really justify making that purchase right now :/"
26-07-2019T15:37:42,NextGenAnubisKid,I
26-07-2019T15:37:51,NextGenAnubisKid,Yeesh that's a big chunk alright
26-07-2019T15:37:59,Mihari,"I can give several justifications, it was an easy sale to Sage XD"
26-07-2019T15:38:00,SageSaga,my book is 30
26-07-2019T15:38:15,SageSaga,yeah i was thinking about the 3800x
26-07-2019T15:38:19,SageSaga,turns out that is a waste of money
26-07-2019T15:38:24,AspiringNoodle,Was about to say
26-07-2019T15:38:43,AspiringNoodle,"Tbh, if you planned on buying a 9900k, you might as well buy a 3900x :p"
26-07-2019T15:38:44,SageSaga,but instead of going to the 3700x... I WENT UP
26-07-2019T15:39:03,NextGenAnubisKid,I'm probs gonna go for the 3600x or 3700x and a Radeon 5700
26-07-2019T15:39:09,AspiringNoodle,You actually got your hands on a 3900x???
26-07-2019T15:39:09,SageSaga,but the 3900x is backordered almost everywhere
26-07-2019T15:39:17,AspiringNoodle,"Ah, nvm :3"
26-07-2019T15:39:20,SageSaga,yeeeeah
26-07-2019T15:39:29,NextGenAnubisKid,Oh wow XD
26-07-2019T15:39:29,SageSaga,im gonna have all my parts EXCEPT THE CPU
26-07-2019T15:39:40,AspiringNoodle,What gpu?
26-07-2019T15:39:48,SageSaga,2080 Super
26-07-2019T15:39:59,AspiringNoodle,*hides from bgr's incoming rant*
26-07-2019T15:40:06,SageSaga,i'll ban em
26-07-2019T15:40:13,NextGenAnubisKid,XD
26-07-2019T15:40:26,AspiringNoodle,I'm gonna order the rest of my parts by the end of sunday
26-07-2019T15:40:28,CrimsonQuill,Hiya
26-07-2019T15:40:30,AspiringNoodle,Get that 3-day shipping :3
26-07-2019T15:40:31,SageSaga,there is no point in getting a 2080 when the Super is the same price
26-07-2019T15:40:46,AspiringNoodle,The 2080 super is a mixed bag
26-07-2019T15:40:52,SageSaga,the 2080 Super still beats the 2070 and its better for what i do
26-07-2019T15:41:03,SageSaga,its really not- its only just a slightly better 2080
26-07-2019T15:41:15,SageSaga,which is still better than a 2070 super- just not by much
26-07-2019T15:41:20,AspiringNoodle,"It is, but not by the same margins as the 2070 super"
26-07-2019T15:41:26,NextGenAnubisKid,I've had bad enough luck with my current nvidia card as is lol
26-07-2019T15:41:28,SageSaga,and the 2080 Super has even greater headroom for OCs
26-07-2019T15:41:54,AspiringNoodle,The problem is that Nvidia made the 2070 super too good
26-07-2019T15:42:04,SageSaga,also i like the faster memory and the memory is underclocked on the super- its set to 15.5 when the chips are rated at 16
26-07-2019T15:42:15,AspiringNoodle,"When you compare the uplift between the two supers, the 2080 super becomes an even worse deal than normal :c"
26-07-2019T15:42:38,SageSaga,that's people being bad at math
26-07-2019T15:42:56,AspiringNoodle,I'm speaking as a compilation of the tech youtuber community xD
26-07-2019T15:43:32,SageSaga,"i know ive seen em and a lot of them are dumb- the good ones are like ""Yeah... it's fine, it's nothing amazing- its just a slightly better 2080"""
26-07-2019T15:43:43,SageSaga,and i wanted a 2080- so why not get a 2080Super?
26-07-2019T15:44:00,AspiringNoodle,I've been infected by Bgr :p
26-07-2019T15:44:10,SageSaga,then we have to put you down
26-07-2019T15:44:21,AspiringNoodle,"No, we must kill Bgr"
26-07-2019T15:44:27,AspiringNoodle,And then I'll be free of his curse
26-07-2019T15:45:06,AspiringNoodle,"Btw, which brand?"
26-07-2019T15:45:11,AspiringNoodle,I'm looking at Gigabyte
26-07-2019T15:45:50,SageSaga,EVGA
26-07-2019T15:46:12,AspiringNoodle,Not bad.  Double slot or triple slot.  And double fan or triple fan?
26-07-2019T15:46:21,AspiringNoodle,"I was considering EVGA, but I don't like the translucent plastic :/"
26-07-2019T15:46:26,SageSaga,DOUBLE TRIPLES
26-07-2019T15:46:54,SageSaga,2080 Super FTW3 Ultra
26-07-2019T15:47:24,Bgrmystr2,why tf would I rant about the 2080 super? I'm not even in this conversation
26-07-2019T15:47:41,AspiringNoodle,"Too much money, likely"
26-07-2019T15:47:44,Bgrmystr2,"Btw if I've infected you, it's too late. My death only makes the infection grow stronger. :P"
26-07-2019T15:48:12,AspiringNoodle,"Sage, I hope you got some nice speedy ram for your build <3"
26-07-2019T15:48:17,SageSaga,yep
26-07-2019T15:48:42,AspiringNoodle,I'm only gonna be able to snag 3200 CL14 atm
26-07-2019T15:48:50,NextGenAnubisKid,Which RAM brand?
26-07-2019T15:49:07,AspiringNoodle,"Evrything else is either overpriced, not sold by Newegg, or I don't like the look"
26-07-2019T15:49:08,SageSaga,Corsair
26-07-2019T15:49:22,AspiringNoodle,I'm going G.skill
26-07-2019T15:49:34,NextGenAnubisKid,"Gotcha, that's one that's been recommended to me a lot (Corsair that is)"
26-07-2019T15:49:43,AspiringNoodle,"Corsair is a tad overpriced in comparison atm.  And if you get 3600 CL16 memory from them, the timings are 16-18-18 and not 16-16-16"
26-07-2019T15:49:52,AspiringNoodle,But weirdly enough Corsair's 3200 is 14-14-14
26-07-2019T15:49:56,Mihari,gskill ftw! :D
26-07-2019T15:50:15,SageSaga,they didnt have gskill at the speed i wanted
26-07-2019T15:50:23,SageSaga,at a decent price*
26-07-2019T15:50:30,Mihari,I Was gonna say XD
26-07-2019T15:50:34,SageSaga,corsair was on sale
26-07-2019T15:50:42,Mihari,I remember XD
26-07-2019T15:50:46,AspiringNoodle,There's a 32GB set of Gskill 3200 CL14 for $328 atm
26-07-2019T15:50:51,SageSaga,and had RGB :D
26-07-2019T15:50:51,AspiringNoodle,4 x 8GB
26-07-2019T15:50:55,NextGenAnubisKid,Plus there was a global RAM shortage for a little while if memory serves lol
26-07-2019T15:50:58,Mihari,stabs.
26-07-2019T15:51:04,SageSaga,2x16GB sticks
26-07-2019T15:51:25,SageSaga,gotta have my 32GBs of memory that i can upgrade to 64
26-07-2019T15:51:44,AspiringNoodle,I'm more or less future proofing myself now for general use
26-07-2019T15:51:47,NextGenAnubisKid,"If I wanted 32 gigs, would you recommend 2x16 or 4x8?"
26-07-2019T15:51:58,AspiringNoodle,"For absolute performance, 2x16"
26-07-2019T15:52:08,AspiringNoodle,"For looks with a chance of slightly less performance, 4x8"
26-07-2019T15:52:21,NextGenAnubisKid,I'll take the performance XD
26-07-2019T15:53:00,AspiringNoodle,I'm going 32GB for a few reasons
26-07-2019T15:53:01,Bgrmystr2,wouldn't they perform exactly the same if they were the same specs?
26-07-2019T15:53:26,SageSaga,nope
26-07-2019T15:53:30,Bgrmystr2,just that one set leaves room for more ram later
26-07-2019T15:53:38,AspiringNoodle,There's a good chance in the next few years games will finally break the 16GB barrier in ram usage (a few in the past few years already get systems up to 12.5)
26-07-2019T15:54:14,SageSaga,depends on the slots- they have different designs- some work better with 2 slots being used than 4 if they are daisy chained
26-07-2019T15:54:23,AspiringNoodle,"There are a lot of professional applications that see performance gains up to 64GB, but most hit the limit at 32 or lower"
26-07-2019T15:54:44,SageSaga,if they arent run on the board as daisy chains then they will perform better but those boards usually cost more
26-07-2019T15:55:00,AspiringNoodle,"Sage, you get an X570 board? :D"
26-07-2019T15:55:04,SageSaga,yep
26-07-2019T15:55:12,AspiringNoodle,Which brand
26-07-2019T15:55:19,SageSaga,Gigabyte
26-07-2019T15:55:22,AspiringNoodle,YAS
26-07-2019T15:55:29,SageSaga,I was going with MSI but they were out of stock
26-07-2019T15:55:36,AspiringNoodle,Aorus Master? :3
26-07-2019T15:55:46,Mihari,Hehe not quite
26-07-2019T15:55:53,SageSaga,too expensive for me
26-07-2019T15:56:01,AspiringNoodle,Awwww :c
26-07-2019T15:56:12,AspiringNoodle,Here's my *tentative* build: https://pcpartpicker.com/list/pNMNfH
26-07-2019T15:56:34,AspiringNoodle,Ram might change to 3600 CL16 if it becomes available
26-07-2019T15:56:56,AspiringNoodle,"And I still can't decide between 3700x vs 3900x, and 2070s vs 2080s.  I'll most likely decide based on availability <3"
26-07-2019T15:57:44,NextGenAnubisKid,Think I'll work on getting atentative build together myself
26-07-2019T15:57:44,Mihari,Here is mine so far: https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Mihari/saved/xQvgwP
26-07-2019T15:58:36,AspiringNoodle,I can't bring myself to buy a 2080 ti after the price hike
26-07-2019T15:58:41,AspiringNoodle,Even though I'd really like one ;_;
26-07-2019T15:58:44,SageSaga,the AIO seems like overkill and is pricey Noodle
26-07-2019T15:59:03,Mihari,I still have decided on my AIO
26-07-2019T15:59:03,AspiringNoodle,My build is all about airflow <3
26-07-2019T15:59:15,Mihari,haven't*
26-07-2019T15:59:22,AspiringNoodle,"My case has 2 200mm intakes, and a 140 exhaust"
26-07-2019T15:59:29,Mihari,"Still thinking about going water for this, but..."
26-07-2019T15:59:38,AspiringNoodle,"Even with the 360 aio, there's still likely gonna be a huge imbalance towards positive pressure"
26-07-2019T15:59:58,SageSaga,I have that case Noodle
26-07-2019T16:00:58,SageSaga,it's sitting behind me waiting for a CPU to arrive
26-07-2019T16:01:32,AspiringNoodle,I might also potentially upgrade the cpu in a few years
26-07-2019T16:01:50,SageSaga,im using a Noctua cooler though
26-07-2019T16:01:51,AspiringNoodle,"Depends on how quickly the AM4 platform disappears, and how good the CPUs on offer are :3"
26-07-2019T16:02:58,AspiringNoodle,The 150 probably is overkill for the 3700x.  But not for a 3900x.
26-07-2019T16:03:46,SageSaga,you need to do some math Bgr
26-07-2019T16:03:53,RoyyalistStudios,hihi peoples! :ptv-greetings:
26-07-2019T16:04:09,SageSaga,yo Royyalist
26-07-2019T16:04:10,NextGenAnubisKid,Allo Royal
26-07-2019T16:04:45,BadFoMo,Yo.
26-07-2019T16:06:26,RoyyalistStudios,How're people doing?
26-07-2019T16:06:37,FoxxTrotter,"Hi, Royallist."
26-07-2019T16:08:11,Mihari,I should probably say my list is more for my personal reference as half of my parts had no cost cause I already had them.
26-07-2019T16:08:45,AspiringNoodle,I'm trying to explain to Bgr that your rig is NOT going to cost $1600 dollars
26-07-2019T16:08:48,Mihari,"Video Card, PSU, Case, NVME's, my whole build is easily over $3000"
26-07-2019T16:08:49,AspiringNoodle,But more like $3600
26-07-2019T16:08:53,SageSaga,which is obvious because the first 2 things equal 1000USD and the build total is under 2k - and theres a 2080Ti on the list
26-07-2019T16:09:42,Bgrmystr2,Does the website not take into account purchased items being 0 because they're already purchased?
26-07-2019T16:09:44,NextGenAnubisKid,What RAM speed?
26-07-2019T16:09:51,Mihari,It's also not including the cooling for the CPU at all.
26-07-2019T16:09:56,NextGenAnubisKid,3200 or 3600? Which one is recommended?
26-07-2019T16:10:03,Mihari,"My Ram is ""4000"""
26-07-2019T16:10:54,SageSaga,only if you put them in Bgr Mihari set them to 0 because she already owned them
26-07-2019T16:11:06,SageSaga,its for personal reference of what she needs to get
26-07-2019T16:11:10,SageSaga,and the cost
26-07-2019T16:11:32,SageSaga,"but you should have looked at the CPU, the GPU and looked at the total and said ""Nope"""
26-07-2019T16:12:15,Bgrmystr2,"oh, what I didn't notice was the motherboard and ram having a price"
26-07-2019T16:12:27,Mihari,Yah the video card alone is $1499.99
26-07-2019T16:12:35,Bgrmystr2,fffffffffffff I can't eyes :ptv-uneasy:
26-07-2019T16:12:48,Bgrmystr2,I thought EVERYTHING purchased was $0
26-07-2019T16:12:52,SageSaga,XD
26-07-2019T16:13:02,Bgrmystr2,so I figured the website already put together the prices
26-07-2019T16:13:25,SageSaga,no it gives you a total- a whats left and whats purchased
26-07-2019T16:13:39,Bgrmystr2,"I figured the GPU you got on a crazy sale or something, maybe on cyber monday or whatever"
26-07-2019T16:14:10,SageSaga,not possible
26-07-2019T16:14:19,AspiringNoodle,"Bgr, here's a more accurate representation of Mihari's build: https://pcpartpicker.com/list/s9sGWD"
26-07-2019T16:14:22,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
26-07-2019T16:14:27,SageSaga,it's never gone on sale like that
26-07-2019T16:15:20,Bgrmystr2,Well I don't know? XD Lots of stuff goes on sale I can't keep track of all of it.
26-07-2019T16:15:33,Mihari,LOL
26-07-2019T16:15:34,SageSaga,if Mihari had gotten a 2080Ti FTW3 Ultra on sale for like under 700 bucks i would have asked for one too
26-07-2019T16:15:41,Mihari,I wish I paid that price for my 960's XD
26-07-2019T16:16:17,SageSaga,she got the 960s when they were new
26-07-2019T16:16:32,Bgrmystr2,lool maybe Mihari just.. has secret ways of finding cheap hardware. :thinking:
26-07-2019T16:16:46,Mihari,"I do, but there just somethings you can't get cheap."
26-07-2019T16:16:48,Bgrmystr2,totally ninja arts or somethin
26-07-2019T16:16:48,AspiringNoodle,It's the little details
26-07-2019T16:17:02,AspiringNoodle,I picked up on the price discrepancy on Mihari's list immediately ;)
26-07-2019T16:17:23,SageSaga,"""This EVGA card fell off the back of a truck-"" ""Then its probably broken"" ""No man- jeez- i mean-"""
26-07-2019T16:17:29,Bgrmystr2,I don't use the site really at all so that doesn't surprise me
26-07-2019T16:19:06,AspiringNoodle,"Idk about you guys, but I'm not a big fan of Corsair's Dominator Platinum RGB ram"
26-07-2019T16:19:15,AspiringNoodle,I much prefer the vengeance pro or g.skill's trident z :p
26-07-2019T16:22:50,AspiringNoodle,"Ugh, gotta go for now.  Haven't mowed the lawn in like 2 weeks"
26-07-2019T16:22:58,AspiringNoodle,It's so tall.  Gonna take me forever to finish ;_;
26-07-2019T16:23:01,SageSaga,have fun
26-07-2019T16:23:08,NextGenAnubisKid,Take care Noodle!
26-07-2019T16:23:14,AspiringNoodle,I didn't mow last week because the felt temperature was near 110
26-07-2019T16:23:23,NextGenAnubisKid,I feel that
26-07-2019T16:23:25,AspiringNoodle,At least it's cooler this week ;w;
26-07-2019T16:23:37,NextGenAnubisKid,I need to do cleaning myself. Just building a little test PC build
26-07-2019T16:23:48,NextGenAnubisKid,"By the way, what panel type for monitors do you guys recommend?"
26-07-2019T16:24:07,AspiringNoodle,IPS
26-07-2019T16:24:11,AspiringNoodle,or VA
26-07-2019T16:24:16,AspiringNoodle,They're realistically the same thing
26-07-2019T16:26:29,NextGenAnubisKid,Gotcha
26-07-2019T16:26:39,Bgrmystr2,What was the monitor that Linus was looking at that used two LCD panels to be potentially better than OLED?
26-07-2019T16:26:42,NextGenAnubisKid,https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Anu_Sekani/saved/#view=qrZGcf Done with first pass.
26-07-2019T16:26:57,NextGenAnubisKid,"Not sure, but I will have to look into that now XD"
26-07-2019T16:27:00,Bgrmystr2,"I remember him seeing a booth at one of the tech shows, but can't recall it"
26-07-2019T16:27:13,Bgrmystr2,it was the one where he said he always passed it by
26-07-2019T16:27:21,Bgrmystr2,fuck if I can remember :/
26-07-2019T16:27:21,SageSaga,bad link Anubiskid
26-07-2019T16:27:39,NextGenAnubisKid,...probs cause I have it set to private
26-07-2019T16:27:43,NextGenAnubisKid,Whoops XD
26-07-2019T16:27:45,NextGenAnubisKid,One sec
26-07-2019T16:28:04,SageSaga,i set mine to private but theres usually a public link you can copy and paste
26-07-2019T16:28:39,NextGenAnubisKid,Gotcha
26-07-2019T16:30:01,NextGenAnubisKid,https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Anu_Sekani/saved/qrZGcf
26-07-2019T16:30:18,Mihari,Private
26-07-2019T16:30:35,NextGenAnubisKid,Huh
26-07-2019T16:30:58,MatyMaty,back
26-07-2019T16:31:11,SageSaga,wb
26-07-2019T16:31:14,Mihari,foward
26-07-2019T16:31:22,MatyMaty,:P

26-07-2019T16:31:32,MatyMaty,o/
26-07-2019T16:31:41,NextGenAnubisKid,WB Maty ^^
26-07-2019T16:31:57,MatyMaty,"oh, PC parts? I will need help once I get my new computer in a few months XD"
26-07-2019T16:32:22,NextGenAnubisKid,Yeah trying to share the build I'm thinking of
26-07-2019T16:32:27,NextGenAnubisKid,But having issues with linking it lol
26-07-2019T16:32:29,SageSaga,why would you need help if you already have a new computer?
26-07-2019T16:33:15,MatyMaty,my computer is 2 years old :P
26-07-2019T16:33:25,MatyMaty,and I am technically getting it for free
26-07-2019T16:33:32,SageSaga,I think maybe you said something wrong then
26-07-2019T16:33:42,MatyMaty,so I plan to get a cintiq and a new comp
26-07-2019T16:34:11,SageSaga,"it seems you said ""I will need some help buying PC parts after I get a new computer in a few months"""
26-07-2019T16:34:30,MatyMaty,sorry ;_; non english native speaker
26-07-2019T16:34:43,SageSaga,I know- just pointing out I dont understand how ya meant it
26-07-2019T16:34:58,MatyMaty,oh I mean I will get a new computer in a couple months
26-07-2019T16:35:03,SageSaga,you want help picking out PC parts for a computer you plan to build in a few months
26-07-2019T16:35:05,SageSaga,?
26-07-2019T16:35:06,MatyMaty,or rather have the bedget fot one
26-07-2019T16:35:10,MatyMaty,yes :P
26-07-2019T16:35:39,SageSaga,got it- we can do that- dont listen to anything Bgr says unless we say something that matches
26-07-2019T16:35:57,MatyMaty,XD
26-07-2019T16:36:21,Bgrmystr2,I found it :D?!
26-07-2019T16:36:53,Bgrmystr2,Hisense with the ULED
26-07-2019T16:37:34,MatyMaty,Isn't Hisense a kind of crap brand?
26-07-2019T16:37:51,SageSaga,yes
26-07-2019T16:37:53,SageSaga,usually
26-07-2019T16:38:05,SageSaga,hes talking about some tech they managed to come up with though
26-07-2019T16:38:21,Bgrmystr2,They made a dual-LCD panel display that they displayed at CES 2019 which has basically the same black levels of OLED
26-07-2019T16:38:22,SomeNiceUser,When I see someone draw a line: :ptv-excited:
26-07-2019T16:38:22,SageSaga,pretty neat but who knows if they actually perfected it -
26-07-2019T16:38:38,NextGenAnubisKid,Or how long it will last
26-07-2019T16:38:42,Bgrmystr2,uses two LCDs inside one display lol
26-07-2019T16:38:52,NextGenAnubisKid,"https://pcpartpicker.com/list/RcQJsZ Kay, I think the link should work now"
26-07-2019T16:39:45,Bgrmystr2,"..the CPU comes with a cooler though, why is it listed as a separate item?"
26-07-2019T16:40:05,SomeNiceUser,"I love how this comic page is going Sage, c"
26-07-2019T16:40:09,NextGenAnubisKid,"Good point, that's me putting this thing together in a hurry XD"
26-07-2019T16:40:15,NextGenAnubisKid,"And yee, it's coming along very nicely Sage!"
26-07-2019T16:40:16,SomeNiceUser,Keep up the great work!
26-07-2019T16:40:54,SageSaga,internet in the red
26-07-2019T16:41:02,SomeNiceUser,woofgrils best grils
26-07-2019T16:41:27,SomeNiceUser,Change my mind.
26-07-2019T16:41:57,MatyMaty,Sage would argue that felines > canines :P
26-07-2019T16:42:00,Bgrmystr2,"Also sage, I saw that. roood :U"
26-07-2019T16:42:20,SageSaga,no - I argue its incorrect to argue any are better than others
26-07-2019T16:42:27,SageSaga,other than for personal taste
26-07-2019T16:42:41,MatyMaty,I like them all :D
26-07-2019T16:42:48,MatyMaty,Except horses
26-07-2019T16:42:53,MatyMaty,horses are a pain to draw
26-07-2019T16:43:08,SageSaga,I dont think ive drawn a horse since uhh
26-07-2019T16:43:16,SomeNiceUser,"I like cat girls, but I prefer wolfs."
26-07-2019T16:43:33,SageSaga,o_o have i ever drawn a horse that wasnt in an art class?
26-07-2019T16:44:02,MatyMaty,Time to make a centaur for A.I
26-07-2019T16:44:07,NextGenAnubisKid,I love catgirls and wolfgirls :P
26-07-2019T16:44:09,SomeNiceUser,Horses are hard to draw.
26-07-2019T16:44:48,SageSaga,i think i could draw a horse alright
26-07-2019T16:44:56,SageSaga,practice would make em better
26-07-2019T16:45:20,MatyMaty,draw all the horse girls
26-07-2019T16:45:39,SageSaga,no
26-07-2019T16:45:42,MatyMaty,"actually, isn't there a manga about racing horses, but they are kemonomimi girls?"
26-07-2019T16:45:48,SageSaga,yes
26-07-2019T16:45:50,SomeNiceUser,Yes
26-07-2019T16:46:10,BadFoMo,What-Girls?
26-07-2019T16:46:21,TeapotOfDoom,Yo.
26-07-2019T16:46:34,SomeNiceUser,Hey guys!
26-07-2019T16:46:35,MatyMaty,Kemonomimi. Like girls/boys with aniaml ears and tails
26-07-2019T16:46:47,MatyMaty,but don't get in monstergirl level like Nyna
26-07-2019T16:47:08,TeapotOfDoom,I heard someone talk about pc parts. I was summoned by the power of Pcpartpicker
26-07-2019T16:48:04,TeapotOfDoom,Also catgirls are best. Fite me
26-07-2019T16:48:13,NextGenAnubisKid,XD
26-07-2019T16:48:23,NextGenAnubisKid,"Hello Teapot, and ye we were talking about that earlier"
26-07-2019T16:48:24,FoxxTrotter,I'm gonna head home. I'll be back on here shortly.
26-07-2019T16:48:41,NextGenAnubisKid,And I posted my rough ballpark first build lol
26-07-2019T16:48:52,NextGenAnubisKid,Ok safe travels Foxx!
26-07-2019T16:49:02,MatyMaty,"That was done previously, Teapot. It didn't caused any fights :P"
26-07-2019T16:49:07,TeapotOfDoom,Byea foxx
26-07-2019T16:49:45,MatyMaty,"Only time I've seen that work was in another artist stream. Someone was like ""elves are the best monstergirl, fite me"""
26-07-2019T16:50:10,MatyMaty,and there was actually a huge argument on whenever elves are monstergirls or not
26-07-2019T16:50:31,ZRO4825,"I'm okay with catgirls, wolfgirls, elves, and full furry characters. Life is about variety after all. :3"
26-07-2019T16:50:48,Bgrmystr2,":thinking: What was the conclusion, Maty"
26-07-2019T16:51:09,MatyMaty,"that Kenkou Cross says elves are monstergirls, hence they are"
26-07-2019T16:51:17,TeapotOfDoom,Elves best monstergirls then
26-07-2019T16:51:28,BadFoMo,"I always thought that Elves were, ...wel, Elves."
26-07-2019T16:51:32,BadFoMo,*well
26-07-2019T16:51:38,TeapotOfDoom,Prolly
26-07-2019T16:51:42,TeapotOfDoom,Who knows
26-07-2019T16:51:46,TeapotOfDoom,I don't
26-07-2019T16:52:10,MatyMaty,"oooh, tanlines"
26-07-2019T16:52:24,TeapotOfDoom,Also anubis use a 3600 ram kit with tighter timings.the huge latency hurts ryzen
26-07-2019T16:52:31,NextGenAnubisKid,"Indeed, I love variety as well ^^ Though I do have my preferences :P"
26-07-2019T16:52:38,Bgrmystr2,"they would include catgirls and other such as monstergirls, yeah?"
26-07-2019T16:52:42,NextGenAnubisKid,"Kay, 3600 RAM kit"
26-07-2019T16:52:42,MatyMaty,Yeah
26-07-2019T16:52:52,Bgrmystr2,Yeah yeah that makes sense for them to include elves.
26-07-2019T16:53:53,TeapotOfDoom,Seams to be kinda the sweetspot for ryzen. The important thing is not the bandwidth but the timings. Your kit has cas 19. Try to get something with cas16 or better yet 14
26-07-2019T16:54:24,MatyMaty,*has no idea about anything involving PC parts*
26-07-2019T16:54:49,TeapotOfDoom,I try to provide assistance ^^
26-07-2019T16:55:44,NextGenAnubisKid,"Thing is I'm trying to go for 32 gigs, 2x16"
26-07-2019T16:55:51,BadFoMo,"@MatyMaty Same. All I know is it works, or it doesn't work."
26-07-2019T16:56:04,NextGenAnubisKid,"And there are no sets of RAM that do that with those CAS latencies, at least not on PC Part Picker"
26-07-2019T16:56:10,TeapotOfDoom,"The frequency determines your bandwidth and cas tells you about the time it takes the cpu to get a response to a request. Best case, both are high. But one mostly kills the other"
26-07-2019T16:56:45,TeapotOfDoom,Hm good question. Not even something with cas 16?
26-07-2019T16:57:02,NextGenAnubisKid,Nope
26-07-2019T16:57:09,TeapotOfDoom,Damn...
26-07-2019T16:57:50,NextGenAnubisKid,If latency is more important than bandwidth I can go for a 4x8 setup?
26-07-2019T16:58:03,TeapotOfDoom,I would have to look up the graphs from ltt on which timings they used
26-07-2019T16:58:39,NextGenAnubisKid,Kay
26-07-2019T16:58:45,Xexanoth,"If you're a ""normal"" user the only thing that matters for RAM are how much you have"
26-07-2019T16:58:50,Xexanoth,*is
26-07-2019T16:59:17,TeapotOfDoom,"Maybe i have answers tomorrow, today's to late. Also i can't promise since i'm going on vacation tomorrow. We'll see if i manage to be here for da stream"
26-07-2019T17:00:13,TeapotOfDoom,You're mostly right
26-07-2019T17:00:19,NextGenAnubisKid,OK
26-07-2019T17:00:39,TeapotOfDoom,"Still if i can optimise the result for the same or less money, i will"
26-07-2019T17:00:40,NextGenAnubisKid,"I plan to do some gaming, may get into some relatively high end gaming but I'm also getting into art"
26-07-2019T17:01:12,TeapotOfDoom,Were you the one who thought about getting csp?
26-07-2019T17:01:18,Xexanoth,in that case you don't really need to put to much though into stuff like bandwith/latency
26-07-2019T17:02:09,NextGenAnubisKid,Yeah I was considering it. Not immediately of course
26-07-2019T17:02:20,NextGenAnubisKid,I wanna do hand sketching and shading before going digital.
26-07-2019T17:03:11,TeapotOfDoom,Well ryzen performance is dependent on memory spec. So you can have a decent impact depending on the mem you choose
26-07-2019T17:04:04,TeapotOfDoom,So yeah i would not overlook it even if it's a bit more complicated then cpu and graphics imo
26-07-2019T17:04:45,NextGenAnubisKid,So with that info I'm thinking about a 4x8 setup then
26-07-2019T17:05:00,NextGenAnubisKid,So I can go for a CAS 16 or 14
26-07-2019T17:05:03,TeapotOfDoom,I really don't know
26-07-2019T17:05:06,NextGenAnubisKid,*setup of RAM
26-07-2019T17:05:17,NextGenAnubisKid,It's all good!
26-07-2019T17:05:22,TeapotOfDoom,I will look at the graphs before recomending anything
26-07-2019T17:05:52,TeapotOfDoom,Cause ryzen boards are also optimised for two stick operation -_-
26-07-2019T17:06:04,NextGenAnubisKid,"Hmmm, kay"
26-07-2019T17:06:12,TeapotOfDoom,Yeaaaah....
26-07-2019T17:06:20,TeapotOfDoom,It's complicated....
26-07-2019T17:06:26,TeapotOfDoom,Sadly
26-07-2019T17:07:23,NextGenAnubisKid,All good ^^ I just appreciate the advice XD
26-07-2019T17:07:47,TeapotOfDoom,No problemo. I love designing systems tbh
26-07-2019T17:09:16,NextGenAnubisKid,Nice ^^
26-07-2019T17:09:31,TeapotOfDoom,Also correcting an error i made earlier. You wat freq to be high and cas to be low. Not both high
26-07-2019T17:09:45,SpazztasticKiwi,should I be drinking caffeine at this hour?
26-07-2019T17:09:48,NextGenAnubisKid,So 4000 and CAS 14
26-07-2019T17:09:51,SpazztasticKiwi,am I doing it anyway?
26-07-2019T17:09:57,NextGenAnubisKid,I do that at work all the time Spazz XD
26-07-2019T17:10:21,TeapotOfDoom,Feel da energy
26-07-2019T17:10:39,TeapotOfDoom,That would be the perfect world anubis
26-07-2019T17:11:10,TeapotOfDoom,"Ryzen can (barely) do 4000, but it seams to be stable"
26-07-2019T17:12:32,NextGenAnubisKid,I should focus on 3600 then?
26-07-2019T17:12:52,TeapotOfDoom,I imangine spazz drinking caffeine being charged like flora from love zap
26-07-2019T17:13:17,TeapotOfDoom,If you can get a kit with better timing yes definitely
26-07-2019T17:13:28,NextGenAnubisKid,I straight up used that picture to explain to a fellow D&D player what Shocking Grasp was XD
26-07-2019T17:13:35,NextGenAnubisKid,Gotcha ^^
26-07-2019T17:14:34,SomeNiceUser,What software are you using Sage?
26-07-2019T17:14:40,TeapotOfDoom,Noodle thought about building a love zap inspired system. Would would so love that. There is ram with plasma tubes on top and stuff like that
26-07-2019T17:14:47,SageSaga,Clip Studio Paint EX
26-07-2019T17:15:12,NextGenAnubisKid,Oh my yes XD
26-07-2019T17:15:37,TeapotOfDoom,Also custom paint job would have been epic
26-07-2019T17:15:46,SomeNiceUser,"Thanks, I’ll look into that later. Watching people draw is very interesting."
26-07-2019T17:16:46,SomeNiceUser,And surprisingly very entertaining.
26-07-2019T17:17:04,TeapotOfDoom,Flora determined focus eyes painted on front and plasma tubes and illuminated watercooling in orange and black with light blue accents
26-07-2019T17:17:20,NextGenAnubisKid,It's inspiring for me to continue my own sketches ^^
26-07-2019T17:17:23,NextGenAnubisKid,And oh my yes XD
26-07-2019T17:17:48,TeapotOfDoom,I would so love to build that system
26-07-2019T17:19:04,SpazztasticKiwi,me on caffeine can end up with me with all the get up and go manageable but with nothing to go to
26-07-2019T17:19:06,NextGenAnubisKid,As would I XD
26-07-2019T17:19:26,SpazztasticKiwi,or me sitting channeling my inner vibrating Flora
26-07-2019T17:19:42,TeapotOfDoom,Lol
26-07-2019T17:19:43,SpazztasticKiwi,though caffeine doesn’t get me near as bad as sugar
26-07-2019T17:19:43,NextGenAnubisKid,"Alright I gotta head off to D&D now. Thanks for all the PC building advice guys! Keep up the great work Sage, the page is coming along nicely!"
26-07-2019T17:19:50,NextGenAnubisKid,Take care!
26-07-2019T17:20:03,TeapotOfDoom,Bye!
26-07-2019T17:20:19,TeapotOfDoom,Sugar rush is bad
26-07-2019T17:20:36,SomeNiceUser,See ya Gen!
26-07-2019T17:21:12,SomeNiceUser,I have some fun with D&D with a few friends.
26-07-2019T17:21:54,SomeNiceUser,Had a good highlight during my first game.
26-07-2019T17:21:54,SageSaga,brb i need a break - gotta move around
26-07-2019T17:22:04,SomeNiceUser,Np sage

26-07-2019T17:23:14,SpazztasticKiwi,stock on snacks - bathroom break beforehand - marathon draw
26-07-2019T17:23:41,SpazztasticKiwi,only the weak get up for breaks
26-07-2019T17:26:31,SpazztasticKiwi,yo I know that’s not anything fancy but that’s a cool little font
26-07-2019T17:27:13,TeapotOfDoom,You mean the brb?
26-07-2019T17:27:27,SomeNiceUser,I have to agree with you Kiwi.
26-07-2019T17:27:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah
26-07-2019T17:27:57,TeapotOfDoom,You can make a font out of this.
26-07-2019T17:28:11,SpazztasticKiwi,you can make a religion out of this
26-07-2019T17:28:18,TeapotOfDoom,Nice
26-07-2019T17:28:27,SpazztasticKiwi,bewbs I mean
26-07-2019T17:28:36,SomeNiceUser,Yes. Yes kiwi
26-07-2019T17:28:37,SpazztasticKiwi,but the font and comic too I guess
26-07-2019T17:28:40,SpazztasticKiwi,why not

26-07-2019T20:39:20,SpazztasticKiwi,my manger came over and intervened she was being so contradictory
26-07-2019T20:42:13,AspiringNoodle,"""Lady, for the love of all that is decent and holy, PICK ONE."""
26-07-2019T20:44:36,AspiringNoodle,i'm amazed
26-07-2019T20:44:50,AspiringNoodle,The Aorus 2070 super has been up for sale for over a day now and hasn't sold out
26-07-2019T20:44:58,AspiringNoodle,*inb4 it sells out because I said something*
26-07-2019T21:01:42,funnyman42,<3
26-07-2019T21:03:31,SpazztasticKiwi,just saw a recent post of my ex
26-07-2019T21:03:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I shook
26-07-2019T21:03:50,SpazztasticKiwi,and slightly dunno what to do with myself
26-07-2019T21:08:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Ad: I don’t know what this is but I bought it for $42 - selling for $20
26-07-2019T21:08:22,SpazztasticKiwi,it looks like half a tire iron
26-07-2019T21:12:47,Sclimshady,"""no lowballs, I know what its worth"""
26-07-2019T21:13:44,AspiringNoodle,I no longer regret not applying to Bethesda
26-07-2019T21:13:47,AspiringNoodle,Fuck them
26-07-2019T21:13:58,SpazztasticKiwi,you might get a virus
26-07-2019T21:14:37,CrRAR,from a tire iron?
26-07-2019T21:15:00,Sclimshady,Tetanus
26-07-2019T21:15:06,SpazztasticKiwi,well that might give ya a flat
26-07-2019T21:15:15,SpazztasticKiwi,or tetanus
26-07-2019T21:15:22,CrRAR,owie
26-07-2019T21:15:28,SpazztasticKiwi,or just a bad infection
26-07-2019T21:18:47,AspiringNoodle,"So, to give my outrage meaning"
26-07-2019T21:18:59,AspiringNoodle,Bethesda added DRM to Doom
26-07-2019T21:19:02,AspiringNoodle,FROM THE FUCKING 90'S
26-07-2019T21:19:30,AspiringNoodle,Now you can't play vintage doom games without a bethesda account
26-07-2019T21:19:43,AspiringNoodle,"Like, what the literal fuck"
26-07-2019T21:21:46,SpazztasticKiwi,dunno
26-07-2019T21:21:51,SpazztasticKiwi,don’t particularly care
26-07-2019T21:21:57,SpazztasticKiwi,#notmyjob
26-07-2019T21:22:24,AspiringNoodle,#OnlyInGaming
26-07-2019T21:23:36,SpazztasticKiwi,so I bought a strawberry n cream shampoo and were the smell at
26-07-2019T21:23:53,SpazztasticKiwi,basically the only reason I got it was to smell like a snac
26-07-2019T21:24:39,AspiringNoodle,SpazztasticKiwi:
26-07-2019T21:24:41,AspiringNoodle,She snacc
26-07-2019T21:24:45,AspiringNoodle,She smacc
26-07-2019T21:24:51,AspiringNoodle,But most importantly
26-07-2019T21:24:55,AspiringNoodle,She talk bacc ;D
26-07-2019T21:25:30,AspiringNoodle,"Or he.  What am I, a f*cking psychic?"
26-07-2019T21:25:35,AspiringNoodle,._.
26-07-2019T21:27:43,CrRAR,hehehe
26-07-2019T22:02:10,AspiringNoodle,ScottFalco doing a Twilight Princess RunHP
26-07-2019T22:02:26,AspiringNoodle,Newest quote added while riding a warthog to get to the desert dungeon
26-07-2019T22:03:00,AspiringNoodle,"""I can't believe I just ride Ganon's mom. *bleurgh*"""
26-07-2019T22:03:23,AspiringNoodle,Ganon gonna need treatment for dem third-degree burns xD
26-07-2019T23:21:04,AspiringNoodle,"Haha, that didn't take long"
26-07-2019T23:21:36,AspiringNoodle,"A combination of backlash / absolutely deserved ridicule from everyone, and Bethesda is now removing the mandatary account login to play vintage Doom titles"
26-07-2019T23:22:04,Bgrmystr2,well wasn't doom on the pc anyway?
26-07-2019T23:22:17,AspiringNoodle,"However, it speaks volumes about what the company thinks of their players when they thought it was okay to do in the first place"
26-07-2019T23:22:28,Bgrmystr2,how would they force people to have something that never had any requirement for any type of server to begin with
26-07-2019T23:22:35,AspiringNoodle,"Yes, but they retroactively added a DRM scheme to a game from the f*cking 90's"
26-07-2019T23:22:42,Bgrmystr2,it's not like they can retroactively change every game that exists
26-07-2019T23:22:52,Bgrmystr2,and there isn't any DRM on the original game that I know of
26-07-2019T23:23:08,Bgrmystr2,people would just spread the original game and not the new one with their DRM
26-07-2019T23:23:11,Bgrmystr2,big deal lol
26-07-2019T23:24:00,AspiringNoodle,You're missing the bigger picture
26-07-2019T23:24:26,AspiringNoodle,The fact that they even thought adding this to old titles was acceptable or even reasonable spells out how the company thinks / what they think of gamers in general
26-07-2019T23:24:57,AspiringNoodle,We're slowly approaching a point where it's easier to remember which companies AREN'T trying to actively screw over their customers
26-07-2019T23:24:59,Bgrmystr2,I didn't miss that part. What I'm saying is that it never was going to work in the first place
26-07-2019T23:25:06,Bgrmystr2,irrelevant whether it was a good idea or not
26-07-2019T23:25:13,Bgrmystr2,"obviously it was not, and everyone knows that"
26-07-2019T23:25:33,Bgrmystr2,but it would never have worked to begin with..
26-07-2019T23:26:12,AspiringNoodle,"Again, I'm saying that this ridiculous faux pas aside, it shows how the company's thinking"
26-07-2019T23:26:29,AspiringNoodle,And this type of thinking is infecting almost every major AAA publisher
26-07-2019T23:26:53,AspiringNoodle,Now we must question every single move they make moving forward
26-07-2019T23:26:58,Bgrmystr2,they had to make the decision to DRM a game that they know damn well everyone already has.. so that was already a red flag before even making the decision..
26-07-2019T23:26:58,AspiringNoodle,Will there be ridiculous DRM?
26-07-2019T23:27:07,Bgrmystr2,actually trying to do it is a second red flag
26-07-2019T23:27:09,AspiringNoodle,"Will they require an account with their company, regardless of platform?"
26-07-2019T23:27:26,AspiringNoodle,How scummy will their microtransactions become?
26-07-2019T23:27:38,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, lotta game companies think that's fine"
26-07-2019T23:27:46,Bgrmystr2,which is a lot of red flags for a lot of companies
26-07-2019T23:27:49,Bgrmystr2,who should all know better.
26-07-2019T23:28:00,Bgrmystr2,"and probably do, but want money and expect people to do nothing."
26-07-2019T23:28:03,AspiringNoodle,Apex Legends has me utterly conflicted
26-07-2019T23:28:09,Bgrmystr2,and then wonder why people take offense.
26-07-2019T23:28:15,AspiringNoodle,It's a property under the EA umbrella
26-07-2019T23:28:23,AspiringNoodle,"But... it's made by Respawn, the creators of Titanfall"
26-07-2019T23:28:26,Bgrmystr2,hm brb
26-07-2019T23:28:32,AspiringNoodle,"Shitty publisher, one of the better developers..."
26-07-2019T23:28:47,AspiringNoodle,"""I THROW MY MONEY AT YOU RESPAWN! *very cautiously*"""
26-07-2019T23:29:25,AspiringNoodle,It should also be pointed out that Bethesda has seen controversy after controversy recently
26-07-2019T23:29:34,AspiringNoodle,It's like they can't go 3 weeks without doing something to piss people off
26-07-2019T23:30:19,SpazztasticKiwi,like you can’t go a day without bringing this up
26-07-2019T23:30:43,AspiringNoodle,"Huh, I thought I didn't bring up Bethesda yet :ptv-wondering:"
26-07-2019T23:31:30,AspiringNoodle,"Kiwi, you play games?"
26-07-2019T23:32:17,Bgrmystr2,"lol, I'd question if humans breath oxygen.. or if the sky looks blue.. or if water is wet :v"
26-07-2019T23:32:28,Bgrmystr2,probably the same answer.
26-07-2019T23:32:34,Bgrmystr2,MAYYYBEEEE?
26-07-2019T23:32:38,AspiringNoodle,"Well, gaming is a big industry / hobby, but not everybody does it"
26-07-2019T23:33:45,AspiringNoodle,"I'm sorry Kiwi, I'll try to tone down the outrage :c"
26-07-2019T23:50:06,SpazztasticKiwi,mobile
26-07-2019T23:50:14,SpazztasticKiwi,don’t own anything else but Fate
26-07-2019T23:50:37,SpazztasticKiwi,I know how to crash team race
26-07-2019T23:50:53,SpazztasticKiwi,heckin reboot
26-07-2019T23:51:00,SpazztasticKiwi,much pretty
26-07-2019T23:51:05,SpazztasticKiwi,very wow
26-07-2019T23:55:44,AspiringNoodle,"I never played the original, but I want to play the remake :D"
26-07-2019T23:55:54,AspiringNoodle,It reminds me so much of Diddy Kong Racing xD
26-07-2019T23:56:16,AspiringNoodle,...Diddy Kong Racing remake plz
