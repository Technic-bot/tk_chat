31-01-2019T14:06:31,Twokinds,I wonder how people pronounce Eric's last name

31-01-2019T14:08:11,CrimsonQuill,I pronounce it either 'Vown' (as in gown) or 'Vawn' (as in lawn)
31-01-2019T14:08:48,Xexanoth,i honestly never thought about the pronounciation
31-01-2019T14:08:56,Xexanoth,he's just eric XD

31-01-2019T17:03:50,Bgrmystr2,but they are not a thing.
31-01-2019T17:04:15,ThingsAreMoving,I thought you wanted to summon captain planetfox
31-01-2019T17:04:37,Bgrmystr2,"Lol I was gonna say yeah, CaptainFox is not a thing either."

31-01-2019T17:08:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Yes they can - if things aren’t done
31-01-2019T17:08:15,Bgrmystr2,which was the message after Terra's :| as I had just arrived.
31-01-2019T17:08:37,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, if they bitch at you, then you show them their own rules and say talk to the guy who made em, cuz you're just following rules."
31-01-2019T17:08:42,RimaDraws,hi
31-01-2019T17:09:23,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-rose:
31-01-2019T17:09:27,Bgrmystr2,Ya gotta shove rules in people's faces sometimes.. those that yell at you to follow rules then break them willy nilly and get mad if you even remotely fuckup
31-01-2019T17:09:47,CrimsonQuill,Hi Rima
31-01-2019T17:09:53,Bgrmystr2,Hey Rima
31-01-2019T17:10:34,ThingsAreMoving,o/ Rima
31-01-2019T17:11:11,ThingsAreMoving,"also logic doesn't work with middle management, as far as my experience goes"
31-01-2019T17:11:37,SpazztasticKiwi,His is head management. Three of us are tempted to quit if next week isn’t fixed
31-01-2019T17:11:51,SpazztasticKiwi,They’ve basically thrown out and ignored availability
31-01-2019T17:12:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Some thing they required us to fill out so they could do schedules
31-01-2019T17:12:15,Bgrmystr2,"Usually that's when you have to get in their faces about it. and if they do nothing about it, you go over their head."
31-01-2019T17:12:19,SpazztasticKiwi,And yet now it doesn’t matter to them
31-01-2019T17:12:40,SpazztasticKiwi,BUT no one is here who can change anything
31-01-2019T17:12:42,RimaDraws,o/
31-01-2019T17:12:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Ones on vacation
31-01-2019T17:12:59,SpazztasticKiwi,The other just left after a quick meeting for a doctors appointment
31-01-2019T17:13:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Which Tuesday is my appointment. I scheduled it two weeks ago
31-01-2019T17:13:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Yet they have me working
31-01-2019T17:13:50,SpazztasticKiwi,"ALSO also, this is a day - Tuesday - that I’ve made very clear I’m unavailable"
31-01-2019T17:14:06,SpazztasticKiwi,At any hour. At all. Can’t work that day no exceptions
31-01-2019T17:14:21,ThingsAreMoving,Just tell them you're not coming in that day
31-01-2019T17:14:30,SpazztasticKiwi,"If I call in, I get a point against me. Even with an excuse"
31-01-2019T17:14:38,SpazztasticKiwi,5 points and you’re fired
31-01-2019T17:14:49,ThingsAreMoving,depends on how expendable you are tbh
31-01-2019T17:15:13,ThingsAreMoving,I used to work in a workplace with point system for absences too
31-01-2019T17:15:19,SpazztasticKiwi,And the rest of the week is just about the same. They have me working on days basically opposite of what I’ve specifically said I can work
31-01-2019T17:16:10,ThingsAreMoving,I had a score of 2500+ where normally 200 should cause a disciplinary action. 500+ instant dismissal
31-01-2019T17:16:44,Bgrmystr2,"Just.. don't go in. It's on your sheet, you're not available. They don't get to dock you because they knew about it. Also, if they do, you can go in every single day and bitch at them about it."
31-01-2019T17:17:00,Bgrmystr2,Sometimes the easiest way to do it is to be a more stubbern hardhead than they are willing to be.
31-01-2019T17:17:10,ThingsAreMoving,"If they need ya, they're gonna have to swallow their pride when you don't come in. If you're expendable you should look for something else, cause it's only gonna get worse if they start abusing you like that"
31-01-2019T17:17:12,RimaDraws,i do it all the time
31-01-2019T17:17:17,SpazztasticKiwi,And then they’ll do a write up for not listening to management
31-01-2019T17:17:45,ThingsAreMoving,"Well you're good with words, write a letter to a regional manager stating your case if you'll get those points"
31-01-2019T17:17:46,Bgrmystr2,And that's another thing you can go in and bitch at them for.
31-01-2019T17:17:49,RimaDraws,we cant call in sick or go home sick
31-01-2019T17:17:56,Bgrmystr2,"For me, I'd be the employee from hell."
31-01-2019T17:17:58,RimaDraws,or we get an occurrence
31-01-2019T17:18:03,SpazztasticKiwi,"I know they like me here. Hell, it’s been made well known we can’t expend anyone else"
31-01-2019T17:18:32,ThingsAreMoving,"Then you have them by the balls, you just have to squeeze"
31-01-2019T17:18:39,SpazztasticKiwi,They’ve asked twice for me to be a manager and I’ve said no because I know any position here is bs
31-01-2019T17:18:41,Bgrmystr2,"They can't just say ""Kiwi didn't listen to management"" when management obviously didn't fucking listen to management. xD"

31-01-2019T17:21:46,CrimsonQuill,Students can be tough to teach.

31-01-2019T18:32:34,Dadrobit,"Super late to the conversation, but writing to the district manager ain't gonna do shit but get Spazz fired. D. Manager is gonna complain to Store manager about getting letters. Store manager will fix the problem by finding someone who isn't as uppity."
31-01-2019T18:36:54,Bgrmystr2,Cuz it's not like there's laws against business practices like that.
31-01-2019T18:37:32,Dadrobit,They'll find a way. It's Wal-Mart. Not some vulnerable mom n pop store.
31-01-2019T18:37:53,Dadrobit,"Could be as simple as ""sorry, we're doing layoffs."""
31-01-2019T18:39:58,ThingsAreMoving,That's why if you're expendable and the management tries to make your life a living hell you should start looking for something else.
31-01-2019T18:40:15,ThingsAreMoving,Before you go on a killing spree or end up with severe depression
31-01-2019T18:40:50,ThingsAreMoving,o/ Dad btw
31-01-2019T18:40:54,Bgrmystr2,fairly easy to tell the district manager that the store manager fired you just to shut you up. It gets messy real quick
31-01-2019T18:41:07,JDH,"i worked there for a month and quit them dbags, they do not have there employees backs. they fired a manager i know because someone accused him of saying that they were stealling when he wasn't even working that day"
31-01-2019T18:42:10,Dadrobit,"First of all, prove it. They can just lay off half a dozen others at the same time and it's totally legit."
31-01-2019T18:42:25,JDH,"plus i have a messed up knee and they purposly put me doing stuff I told them I could not do, idk maybe mine is just a dbag store"
31-01-2019T18:42:54,Dadrobit,"And even if litigation happens, they really don't give a shit there either. It's motherfucking Wal-Mart. They have pockets for days."
31-01-2019T18:43:00,JDH,they let someone go cause the manager didnt like him
31-01-2019T18:43:05,Dadrobit,Lawyers all the way down.
31-01-2019T18:43:16,Dadrobit,And hey Things o/
31-01-2019T18:43:39,JDH,"to be fair, the guy was kinda a dick but he didnt do anything wrong"
31-01-2019T18:43:52,Bgrmystr2,it's not that difficult when you have all the documentation showing they're clearly not doing their job and the walkthrough to get to where you are now.
31-01-2019T18:44:36,JDH,everyone I talk to says in my town to avoid working at that store if at all possible lol
31-01-2019T18:45:09,Dadrobit,"And it also depends on state law for her. I know Arizona you can be fired for anything. It's a right to work state. I got fired for ""stealing"" a 5 hr energy because I drank it before paying, even though I had express permission to do so from multiple man"
31-01-2019T18:45:27,JDH,they were not joking but what happened ? the coments only go up so far
31-01-2019T18:45:31,Dadrobit,managers*
31-01-2019T18:45:53,ThingsAreMoving,"Dad, you criminal scum"

31-01-2019T18:46:05,JDH,what a rebel lol
31-01-2019T18:46:28,Dadrobit,Spazz's managers are making scheduling conflicts that are impossible to complete without receiving marks against the employees.
31-01-2019T18:46:38,JDH,oh
31-01-2019T18:46:45,JDH,report em to corporate
31-01-2019T18:46:54,Bgrmystr2,literally my thoughts ^
31-01-2019T18:46:58,JDH,only thing spazz can do
31-01-2019T18:47:17,Dadrobit,"Someone suggested that, I say fuck that. Only because it's Wal-Mart."
31-01-2019T18:47:36,Bgrmystr2,I'd still do it. Because I don't give a shit who they are.
31-01-2019T18:47:45,ThingsAreMoving,srsly I worked in retail for 3 whole years. Even the worst factory environment was a lot better than that
31-01-2019T18:48:04,Dadrobit,And they don't give a shit who their employees are at her level. She's a goner if she did it.
31-01-2019T18:48:12,Bgrmystr2,I don't buy that
31-01-2019T18:48:14,JDH,"even if it gets spazz fired, then he can sue for false whateverthewordisthaticantremember"
31-01-2019T18:48:14,Bgrmystr2,honestly.
31-01-2019T18:48:20,ThingsAreMoving,she*
31-01-2019T18:48:49,Bgrmystr2,"Walmart is a fairly tough opponent though, JDH"
31-01-2019T18:48:54,JDH,*she (didnt know lol)
31-01-2019T18:48:57,Bgrmystr2,considering they're fairly large
31-01-2019T18:48:59,Dadrobit,"Especially since she's turned down offers to move up the ladder already, they can bring forth proof that she was ""unmotivated""."
31-01-2019T18:49:19,Dadrobit,Wal-Mart lawyers don;'t fuck around.
31-01-2019T18:49:23,Dadrobit,don't*
31-01-2019T18:49:24,JDH,standard is what yah can prove
31-01-2019T18:49:38,Bgrmystr2,they also clearly do not know the definition of motivated
31-01-2019T18:49:45,JDH,its easy
31-01-2019T18:49:50,JDH,she gets fired
31-01-2019T18:49:52,Bgrmystr2,since moving up =|= motivation
31-01-2019T18:49:54,JDH,or whatever
31-01-2019T18:50:09,Dadrobit,The only definition they need to prove is what they want to prove in front of a judge.
31-01-2019T18:50:20,JDH,go back in as a customer and claim the manager or whomever is accusing me of stealing
31-01-2019T18:50:30,JDH,its the small things
31-01-2019T18:50:38,Bgrmystr2,"unfortunately, our judges are some fucktarded dudes, I've seen some idiots up there"
31-01-2019T18:51:11,JDH,dang
31-01-2019T18:52:30,JDH,i would still take up with corporate
31-01-2019T18:52:32,Dadrobit,"Far as I'd say. Buckle down. Do the shift you're scheduled to. If they complain, hash it out with them in person. And in the mean time, start filling out applications and/or go back to school."
31-01-2019T18:52:33,ThingsAreMoving,throw some monies at the judical system and you can get away with murdering babies while sieg heiling
31-01-2019T18:52:55,ThingsAreMoving,"also, what Dad-o said"
31-01-2019T18:53:00,Dadrobit,What about murdering babies with a sieg heil?
31-01-2019T18:53:18,Dadrobit,Get 'em with a sideways tennis serve.
31-01-2019T18:53:29,JDH,i mean its frowned uppon but do you boo lol
31-01-2019T18:53:32,ThingsAreMoving,it's a big no no in my part of the world

31-01-2019T18:54:15,Bgrmystr2,then I'm not going in

31-01-2019T18:54:48,Bgrmystr2,and I'm not going to kowtow to some pushover shithead because his ego is too big for his britches.

31-01-2019T18:55:19,Bgrmystr2,which is where you get to challenge them on that.
31-01-2019T18:55:29,ThingsAreMoving,unless you're down with being a hermit or a hobo
31-01-2019T18:55:31,Dadrobit,"My Security gig didn't give a shit about time off forms. They just called it ""mandatory overtime"""

31-01-2019T18:56:52,ThingsAreMoving,It's not what they deserve. It's what they pay.

31-01-2019T18:57:02,Bgrmystr2,irrelevant I guess

31-01-2019T18:59:15,Dadrobit,Albertson's was paying me $9.30 after 3 years there before I got canned. Those guys were fuckers of the worst magnitude.
31-01-2019T18:59:26,JDH,"i was making 12 at lowes starting off as a part time, only reason i quit was I moved and the closest one to me is a 45 min drive"
31-01-2019T18:59:42,Dadrobit,Raises were so slow and low that I just constantly existed at minimum wage.
31-01-2019T18:59:52,JDH,dam
31-01-2019T19:00:25,ThingsAreMoving,"I'm earning around 13$ph, If I land that new job It'll go up to ~16$. After another two, three years I'm looking at 25$-28$ ph"
31-01-2019T19:00:30,Dadrobit,And a few months into my employment they stopped doing sales bonuses because I was the only one winning and everyone else stopped trying. So the decided to cut the program entirely.
31-01-2019T19:00:36,Dadrobit,Fucking made me furious that did.
31-01-2019T19:00:46,Dadrobit,they*
31-01-2019T19:01:06,JDH,wow
31-01-2019T19:01:10,JDH,thats messed up
31-01-2019T19:01:20,ThingsAreMoving,So instead of getting better they dragged down everyone including you
31-01-2019T19:01:37,ThingsAreMoving,cause I doubt you had the incentive to work hard after that spit in the face
31-01-2019T19:02:19,Dadrobit,"Yeah, fuck that."
31-01-2019T19:02:29,Dadrobit,Then they bitched at me for not selling as much.
31-01-2019T19:02:52,Bgrmystr2,"""Sounds like you should have kept the sales bonuses huh?"""
31-01-2019T19:02:59,Bgrmystr2,-me in your shoes probably
31-01-2019T19:03:02,Dadrobit,Exactly what I told them.
31-01-2019T19:03:07,Bgrmystr2,good
31-01-2019T19:03:33,Dadrobit,They just shrugged it off. I still sold more than anyone else even without really trying.
31-01-2019T19:04:07,Bgrmystr2,cuz they're not willing to face their own fuckups lol
31-01-2019T19:04:10,Bgrmystr2,so they just avoid it
31-01-2019T19:04:32,ThingsAreMoving,"in my current employment everyone's getting a 150£ gift card just before christmas, managing directors get 258k£"
31-01-2019T19:05:09,ThingsAreMoving,I'm not saying I deserve their money. I'm saying investing in your workforce should be something logical.
31-01-2019T19:05:49,Bgrmystr2,258 thousand euro.. while everyone else gets 150
31-01-2019T19:05:57,Bgrmystr2,that's a LITTLE fucking lopsided
31-01-2019T19:06:05,Bgrmystr2,just a tad.
31-01-2019T19:06:06,Dadrobit,Security was better in that regard. Working on holidays and events was 2x pay. And the clients liked to give out free food and tips on top. So it was't bad.
31-01-2019T19:06:14,ThingsAreMoving,"pounds, not euro"
31-01-2019T19:06:21,ThingsAreMoving,"but yeah, you get the picture"
31-01-2019T19:06:27,Bgrmystr2,Is that not the euro?
31-01-2019T19:06:31,ThingsAreMoving,noep
31-01-2019T19:06:38,Bgrmystr2,what's the euro
31-01-2019T19:06:44,ThingsAreMoving,€
31-01-2019T19:06:54,Bgrmystr2,ahh
31-01-2019T19:07:12,ThingsAreMoving,looks a bit like cylon ship from battlestar: galactica
31-01-2019T19:07:14,Bgrmystr2,"okay, cuz literally every website I see selling shit for euros uses the pounds symbol."
31-01-2019T19:07:20,Bgrmystr2,which is.. dumb but
31-01-2019T19:07:20,Bgrmystr2,yeah
31-01-2019T19:07:32,Dadrobit,"Not that we were ""allowed"" to take tips, but we all took them anyways. Could make a good couple hundred working Christmas and Valentines."
31-01-2019T19:07:58,ThingsAreMoving,Not like taking tips is harmful in any way
31-01-2019T19:08:12,ThingsAreMoving,If someone is willing to give you extra money than why not
31-01-2019T19:08:23,Bgrmystr2,"it's none of their business though, your tips are your personal thanks from those you help. It's not part of the business income, it's a personal thing."
31-01-2019T19:08:26,ThingsAreMoving,then* ?
31-01-2019T19:08:35,Dadrobit,Made close to a grand in tips on my final day from folks giving me send-offs.
31-01-2019T19:09:39,Dadrobit,"In security, that's dangerously close to taking a bribe."
31-01-2019T19:09:41,unsteddyphoenix,America even gives security guards tips?
31-01-2019T19:09:44,unsteddyphoenix,Wild
31-01-2019T19:09:46,unsteddyphoenix,Also hi
31-01-2019T19:09:51,Dadrobit,o/ unsteddy
31-01-2019T19:09:52,ThingsAreMoving,o/ kiwibroseph
31-01-2019T19:09:55,Bgrmystr2,there's a lot of people that can give tips
31-01-2019T19:09:57,JDH,"i remember in highschool, this old lady would always give us tips at winndixie, our store was strick about not taking tips. yeah she didnt care, didnt matter who it was, $50 got shoved in our hand or pocket and was told to take it and shush"
31-01-2019T19:10:11,Bgrmystr2,"honestly, as long as you're working directly with customers, you can get tips."
31-01-2019T19:10:21,Bgrmystr2,it's just not as common for some jobs as others
31-01-2019T19:10:50,ThingsAreMoving,Direct someone to a correct aisle in wal-mart = get tipped
31-01-2019T19:10:52,ThingsAreMoving,murica
31-01-2019T19:10:54,Dadrobit,"It was more my station than security in general. Because I was access control for all these folks, I interacted with them and served them in person daily."
31-01-2019T19:11:06,Bgrmystr2,lol things
31-01-2019T19:11:09,ThingsAreMoving,xD
31-01-2019T19:11:46,JDH,i loved the people who would bring us hot cocoa or coffee on cold days at entry points dadrobit
31-01-2019T19:11:52,Dadrobit,"Made them coffee/tea, had a chat, updated their guest lists for them, did whatever."
31-01-2019T19:12:21,Dadrobit,"Yeah, ice cream during the summer was a godsend from the clients."
31-01-2019T19:12:40,JDH,you got icecream...lucky lol
31-01-2019T19:13:16,Dadrobit,"Though it turned into a hassle a year into my tenure. One of the guards got ""drugged"" by a weed cookie from one of the residents. So after that we had to get signatures and cma checks on everything we took."
31-01-2019T19:13:33,JDH,lol
31-01-2019T19:14:23,JDH,"i was on a military base so i didnt have to worry about that to much, it was mostly soldiers coming in"
31-01-2019T19:14:59,JDH,it was a everyone knew everyone kinda thing
31-01-2019T19:15:24,ThingsAreMoving,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
31-01-2019T19:15:47,ThingsAreMoving,:ctwokinds-RaineEep: No! Stream today!
31-01-2019T19:16:21,Dadrobit,"It was similar at my post. Talking with these folks every day as they came in, if you made it past their hazing process, they turned into pretty decent folks and liked making our jobs easier."
31-01-2019T19:16:38,ThingsAreMoving,Imma lurk and play some rimworld. Cya later.
31-01-2019T19:17:06,JDH,"yeah, same lol and later things"
31-01-2019T19:17:40,Dadrobit,"I was on very good terms with probably 85% of all of our clients. The rest were all very ""business first"" kinda folks. And only one family actively hated me."
31-01-2019T19:18:41,JDH,"i had about the same turnaround, still one of my more favorite jobs lol"
31-01-2019T19:18:58,JDH,but went back to school and moved and all that jazz
31-01-2019T19:20:21,Dadrobit,Favorite story from that place: https://www.twokinds.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=833507#p833507
31-01-2019T19:20:43,Dadrobit,And same. Went back to school for a degree in Audio Production Technologies.
31-01-2019T19:21:19,Dadrobit,Looking to go forward with a bachelors and maybe get a gig as an engineer somewhere.
31-01-2019T19:22:48,SpazztasticKiwi,🥗
31-01-2019T19:23:06,JDH,"nice, im doing drafting and design"
31-01-2019T19:23:15,JDH,but only going for a AS
31-01-2019T19:25:24,Dadrobit,I only did the Certificate version of the program. That was enough for me to really get into voice acting for myself. Now I'm going back for the missing Math/English classes for the AS as well.
31-01-2019T19:26:06,Dadrobit,Then I'm thinking getting a BA in business. Just to have the option of vertical movement in a company if I do end up getting a job as an engineer.
31-01-2019T19:26:07,JDH,awe that story was so heartwarming
31-01-2019T19:26:18,JDH,the cake was a pokemon thing
31-01-2019T19:26:43,JDH,"oh wow, very nice"
31-01-2019T19:27:17,JDH,"best of luck, i did about half a film degree, that stuff can be a hard buisness to get into"
31-01-2019T19:27:21,Dadrobit,"Yeah, the cake had a bucha different pokemon on it, and he saved that piece just for me. Something definitely got in my eye after that I tell ya hwat."
31-01-2019T19:27:28,Dadrobit,buncha*
31-01-2019T19:27:45,Bgrmystr2,must have been raining onions or something
31-01-2019T19:27:54,Bgrmystr2,"not that it'd have any affect on you, of course"
31-01-2019T19:28:10,Dadrobit,Definitely not.
31-01-2019T19:28:20,Bgrmystr2,thought as much.
31-01-2019T19:28:35,JDH,"only real men shed one tear, one, not two"
31-01-2019T19:28:51,Dadrobit,Liquid pride you mean?
31-01-2019T19:29:58,JDH,yes
31-01-2019T19:30:39,Bgrmystr2,real men cry tears of manliness.
31-01-2019T19:30:40,Dadrobit,"As for the audio engineering side of things, I friggin love this stuff. I'd routinely stay after class in the studio for hours just working on projects only leaving until the janitor came in."
31-01-2019T19:30:55,Dadrobit,Still do my own sound design shenanigans at home.
31-01-2019T19:31:40,ThingsAreMoving,That's passion. Never experienced it myself tbh.
31-01-2019T19:32:59,JDH,"im enjoying the drafting over the film thing, but I did have to take an audio class and I have to say, was in my top 3 of favorite classes"
31-01-2019T19:33:05,JDH,even with the drafting
31-01-2019T19:33:09,Dadrobit,"It's like working on a puzzle with an infinite number of pieces, that you have to make yourself, in a fixed amount of room. It's a creative science challenge."
31-01-2019T19:33:10,JDH,for now
31-01-2019T19:33:32,Dadrobit,Studio recording?
31-01-2019T19:34:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Back
31-01-2019T19:34:44,JDH,"i think it was just a basic audio class, it was about 2-3 years ago"
31-01-2019T19:34:47,Dadrobit,wb
31-01-2019T19:34:54,JDH,intro to audio
31-01-2019T19:35:15,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m cutting stuff out early so I better got out at 8 like I should
31-01-2019T19:35:31,Dadrobit,Just learning about stuff like diffusion from deflection and that kinda stuff?
31-01-2019T19:35:39,Dadrobit,2x the stuff
31-01-2019T19:35:44,JDH,"fun fact, because i got halfway through the film degree, I have a cert that says I can work at an actual theater"
31-01-2019T19:36:44,JDH,"dont get me wrong, the film stuff was great, just I would rather do as a hobby than proffression (spelling?)"
31-01-2019T19:37:21,Dadrobit,profession
31-01-2019T19:39:33,JDH,"ah, thought so lol im also mildly buzzed so..."

31-01-2019T19:59:39,ThingsAreMoving,especially if you can get some that aren't mass produced pisswasser that's supposed to have no taste
31-01-2019T20:00:56,ThingsAreMoving,I guess being a beer enthusiast in America is pretty hard.
31-01-2019T20:02:55,JDH,"not hard, but I am not a big beer person, I live in a dry county and dont like driving for other things"

31-01-2019T21:28:44,Dadrobit,Chubbyemu is the doctor's pseudonym. His channel is actually fantastic.
31-01-2019T21:28:48,SageSaga,and the light novel has only had a couple volumes released years ago but nothing new in a few years

31-01-2019T23:19:04,MrEase,"that being said, I don't think I would given my FA isn't really for cute SFW pics, and I feel like w0lf wouldn't appreciate that"
31-01-2019T23:19:21,Combak,"Well, we just missed asking him about it. XD"

31-01-2019T23:27:47,SageSaga,I have fixed it up a lot- and colored 80% or so of it already
31-01-2019T23:27:49,MrEase,"to be honest, its more about finding the free time to draw the characters I want to draw, due to spending a lot of time at work, and the rest of it doing commissions"
31-01-2019T23:28:04,SkiddArt,I have not seen it yet. :O
31-01-2019T23:28:41,SageSaga,hmm- should i show it on stream or wanna keep it hidden? I can throw up a block and show ya
31-01-2019T23:29:00,unsteddyphoenix,Show it to mods only :D
31-01-2019T23:29:01,MrEase,"so at some point I'll get back to drawing things for fun unsteddy, but at the moment I got kinks to draw lol"
31-01-2019T23:29:21,unsteddyphoenix,"Hey Ease, extremely understandable. Mans gotta eat."
31-01-2019T23:29:40,unsteddyphoenix,You go on and get that bread :)
31-01-2019T23:30:07,ZRO4825,@Mihari  Excellent choice on armor sets from MHW. Kulve set is so nice looking. <3
31-01-2019T23:30:25,ZRO4825,"Seriously, why don't we have a layered set for that yet? <_>;"
31-01-2019T23:30:41,Mihari,I do.
31-01-2019T23:30:50,ZRO4825,You do? :thinking:
31-01-2019T23:30:51,Combak,"Wait, I've got to ask: If Sage could set it to ""Mods only,"" could mods for Tom's channel only see it?"
31-01-2019T23:30:53,Mihari,Altho Sage wasn't supposed to take me seriously.
31-01-2019T23:30:56,ZRO4825,Wait...mods?
31-01-2019T23:31:02,Mihari,Transmog
31-01-2019T23:31:23,SageSaga,i wrote it down at the start when ya told me you were actually going to do it- and then later you said it was a joke
31-01-2019T23:31:27,ZRO4825,"Like, legit in-game layered set? Huh...I don't remember seeing anything about it being put in....when did they sneak that in?"
31-01-2019T23:31:34,Mihari,So if you looked up my guild card it would look like I'm wearing it.
31-01-2019T23:31:44,SageSaga,Transmog is a mod Zro
31-01-2019T23:31:46,Mihari,No their is a transmog 'mod'
31-01-2019T23:31:50,ZRO4825,OH! Okay
31-01-2019T23:32:04,Mihari,But it might as well be official given how well it works.
31-01-2019T23:32:10,ZRO4825,"I'm too used to people just swapping glamour/transmog/layered around instead of calling them by their proper names that I just assumed that's what ya did, lol"
31-01-2019T23:32:27,SkiddArt,Ya know what. Show me privately Sage. People need to WAIT to see awesomeness.
31-01-2019T23:32:43,unsteddyphoenix,D: D: noooo
