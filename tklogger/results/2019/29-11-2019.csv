29-11-2019T05:23:27,Dadrobit,Breathing ASMR is definitely a thing
29-11-2019T05:23:50,Dadrobit,I feel like I was there for that snore stream.
29-11-2019T05:23:57,maku450,asmr is pretty relaxing for sleep tbh
29-11-2019T05:24:22,maku450,who else will poke melons with a 1300s era plague mask :V
29-11-2019T05:24:47,maku450,it's an important market for asmr enthusiasts
29-11-2019T05:25:29,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Winter trees are easy w0lfy.
29-11-2019T05:25:30,maku450,crawling in my eeeears
29-11-2019T05:25:36,Dadrobit,I've only ever had one ASMR experience that worked and it was from a big balding dude crumpling up aluminum foil nearby the ear microphones.
29-11-2019T05:25:42,MarvTheHugPharaoh,A crap tone of branch then dump snow on em
29-11-2019T05:25:51,unsteddyphoenix,I read that as crumping
29-11-2019T05:25:56,unsteddyphoenix,krumping
29-11-2019T05:25:58,w0lfmare,:cw0lfmare-EmberSad:
29-11-2019T05:26:25,Dadrobit,Dunno what krumping is
29-11-2019T05:26:26,maku450,asmr rp is pretty weird imo :v
29-11-2019T05:26:37,maku450,I just like comfy satisfying sounds
29-11-2019T05:27:02,unsteddyphoenix,yoo young i guess
29-11-2019T05:27:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I prefer Oney over Amsr when I sleep
29-11-2019T05:27:46,Dadrobit,I have those bad ASMR with a passion.
29-11-2019T05:27:51,Dadrobit,Hate*

29-11-2019T05:28:10,maku450,fireplaces and rain is comf
29-11-2019T05:28:27,maku450,that'd be a great idea
29-11-2019T05:28:39,MarvTheHugPharaoh,The only amsr I enjoyed was katkams motorcycle one where she just pulled levers and the shifter over and over
29-11-2019T05:29:18,Dadrobit,I should make a parody ASMR. Feel like it's be an easy hit.
29-11-2019T05:29:41,MarvTheHugPharaoh,When you do hit me up dad
29-11-2019T05:29:54,Dadrobit,I used to play fireplace and rain sounds with jazz music when I used to stream reading books.
29-11-2019T05:30:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,rainymood is great for BG noise
29-11-2019T05:30:14,Dadrobit,It was always a good time
29-11-2019T05:30:14,maku450,that sound does sound terrible :V

29-11-2019T05:32:44,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Alien is 70s but ok
29-11-2019T05:32:56,Dadrobit,Alien is a banger
29-11-2019T05:33:04,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Best horror movie there is
29-11-2019T05:33:07,unsteddyphoenix,80's and earlier
29-11-2019T05:33:13,swack24,It was fun at the time
29-11-2019T05:33:18,Dadrobit,Local theatre shows it every once in a while.
29-11-2019T05:33:28,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Teddy I have a 2 minute stream lag

29-11-2019T05:33:42,unsteddyphoenix,Lol unlucky
29-11-2019T05:34:39,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Alien never really scared me.  E.T on the other hand, that shit to this day gives me the jiggies"
29-11-2019T05:35:14,Dadrobit,"""Monster In The Closet"" fucked me up for a long time."
29-11-2019T05:35:28,MarvTheHugPharaoh,W0lfy the Xenos are pretty smart if they have a queen thats old enough
29-11-2019T05:35:39,Dadrobit,"Xemomorphs aren't ""smart"" but they're clever"
29-11-2019T05:36:17,MarvTheHugPharaoh,They run on a hive mind.  If the queen is old enough to hold the info the drones can pretty much have unlimited knowledge
29-11-2019T05:36:18,swack24,"You know while other think of aliens they think of the Roswell Greys, Me when i think of aliens I think of Xenomorphs, never seen an alien Grey before Xenomorphs"

29-11-2019T05:37:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,If you want a scary alien move watch Communion with Christopher walken
29-11-2019T05:38:09,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Fire in the sky is also a blast
29-11-2019T05:38:38,HeresyArtStream,Thomas the Tank Engine with legs is scary.
29-11-2019T05:38:53,swack24,the face alone is scary enough
29-11-2019T05:39:10,HeresyArtStream,It looks like the NPC face.
29-11-2019T05:39:12,swack24,Never like Thomas
29-11-2019T05:39:26,swack24,thoese souless eyes...
29-11-2019T05:39:53,MarvTheHugPharaoh,The RE movies are whack
29-11-2019T05:40:05,HeresyArtStream,I think the only movie that scared me as a kid was Willie Wonka because my parents didn't let me watch anything intense until I was like 12. :p
29-11-2019T05:40:49,swack24,I though that was fun
29-11-2019T05:41:02,HeresyArtStream,"I mean, there were movie scenes that scared me but I just straight up wouldn't watch Willie Wonka."
29-11-2019T05:41:13,Dadrobit,"""Not Like This"" -Switch"
29-11-2019T05:41:16,swack24,Dumbo is what scares me
29-11-2019T05:41:39,HeresyArtStream,"Pinnochio actually scared the shit out of me, now that I think about it."
29-11-2019T05:41:41,swack24,some say john Wick is the Prequel to the Matrix
29-11-2019T05:41:44,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Signs and E.T are the ones that made me fear looking out my window at night for a while
29-11-2019T05:42:13,Dadrobit,Steak guys name was Cypher iirc
29-11-2019T05:42:58,HeresyArtStream,They get one of their batteries back.
29-11-2019T05:44:14,HeresyArtStream,"It's like someone getting banned from Roblox, but they get let back in if they snitch on another cheater. :V"
29-11-2019T05:44:50,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Or Bethesda ""500 words on why you were a very naughty boy."""
29-11-2019T05:44:53,Dadrobit,It's like someone who regretted refunding No Man's Sky and wanted back in after trying Star Citizen.
29-11-2019T05:45:16,unsteddyphoenix,^^^^^^^^^^^^
29-11-2019T05:45:30,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Is star citizen out of alpha/beta?
29-11-2019T05:45:37,HeresyArtStream,no
29-11-2019T05:45:47,TerraTheWizard,ohi heresy :ctwokinds-rainehappy:
29-11-2019T05:45:58,HeresyArtStream,I have Star Citizen. I boot it up every once in a while when new updates come out.
29-11-2019T05:46:22,HeresyArtStream,The next quarterly update is supposed to have economy generated missions which is one of the major milestones.
29-11-2019T05:46:52,Dadrobit,I simply cannot get any amount of hype for SC
29-11-2019T05:47:19,HeresyArtStream,I would say don't spend money on it until it's out of alpha.
29-11-2019T05:47:28,Dadrobit,"Like, the amount of Development Hell they've gone through..."
29-11-2019T05:47:32,MarvTheHugPharaoh,tbh I only seen Robaz play SC and he only did it just to be a meme
29-11-2019T05:47:42,SpazztasticKiwi,k I’m out
29-11-2019T05:47:47,MarvTheHugPharaoh,nighty night kiwi
29-11-2019T05:47:50,HeresyArtStream,If you want a fun space game right now Elite Dangerous fits the bill just fine.
29-11-2019T05:47:54,Dadrobit,o/ Spazz
29-11-2019T05:48:04,HeresyArtStream,Although you have to really love flying because in Elite that's what you will be doing mostly. :V
29-11-2019T05:48:22,Dadrobit,Tried Elite Dangerous. Went back to NMS.
29-11-2019T05:48:33,TerraTheWizard,space truck simulator
29-11-2019T05:48:42,MarvTheHugPharaoh,space station 13 is where its at
29-11-2019T05:48:50,Dadrobit,It's so relaxing for me.
29-11-2019T05:49:18,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"How are you enjoying Death stranding dad, still fun?"
29-11-2019T05:49:20,Dadrobit,Just a nice zen gameplay loop flying around in my freighter
29-11-2019T05:49:32,Dadrobit,I actually haven't games in like 2 weeks
29-11-2019T05:49:39,Dadrobit,Gamed*
29-11-2019T05:49:46,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Big sad
29-11-2019T05:50:03,Dadrobit,I'm excited to get some free time to get back in.
29-11-2019T05:50:29,Dadrobit,Had some vox projects the last couple weekends.

29-11-2019T05:51:48,Dadrobit,Online brood war was for custom maps
29-11-2019T05:51:48,HeresyArtStream,I know even less about Starcraft than I know about Warcraft. Command and Conquer and Red Alert were my jam.
29-11-2019T05:52:20,HeresyArtStream,C&C died chasing the Esport meme because it worked for Starcraft. :(
29-11-2019T05:52:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,The only thing starcraft I'v seen was a exploit by the spiffing brit
29-11-2019T05:52:52,Dadrobit,StarCraft was absolutely my jam. Loved it back in the day.
29-11-2019T05:53:09,Dadrobit,Halfway wish I could get back into competitive.
29-11-2019T05:54:30,Dadrobit,Espots dillution happened
29-11-2019T05:54:35,Dadrobit,Reports*
29-11-2019T05:54:46,maku450,"I think people are probably intimidated by starcraft, and the expertise of competitive players :V"

29-11-2019T05:54:57,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Also blizzard being blizzard didn't help starcraft
29-11-2019T05:55:01,maku450,^
29-11-2019T05:55:29,Dadrobit,"Also yeah, blizzard balancing kinda what the bed."
29-11-2019T05:55:33,HeresyArtStream,"I will never be good enough to be an internet athlete, so the move away from single player is what killed RTS games for me."
29-11-2019T05:55:35,Dadrobit,Shit the bed
29-11-2019T05:56:09,Dadrobit,They literally over balanced the game
29-11-2019T05:56:20,HeresyArtStream,I do like Total Warhammer though. It has 4X and RTS gameplay so I can play however I want depending on how sluggish my reflexes are on a particular day.
29-11-2019T05:56:27,swack24,I like Red alert series
29-11-2019T05:56:35,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Warhammer 2 is legit great
29-11-2019T05:56:50,HeresyArtStream,I should buy it while it's on sale
29-11-2019T05:57:36,Dadrobit,"SC2 matches became decided within the first few minutes, you could just TELL what was gonna happen."
29-11-2019T05:58:00,HeresyArtStream,Total Warhammer is so popular that they're making a tabletop version called Warhammer: The Old World. :V
29-11-2019T05:58:29,MarvTheHugPharaoh,W0lfy those are fix'd now
29-11-2019T05:58:54,Dadrobit,"Also, SC2 was huge for a few years before DotA/Lol/CS;GO/Overwatch dilluted eSports scenes."
29-11-2019T05:59:50,MarvTheHugPharaoh,CS:GO is fun when not taken seriously
29-11-2019T05:59:58,Dadrobit,I play LoL.
29-11-2019T06:00:09,Dadrobit,Support checking in
29-11-2019T06:00:22,maku450,I really like cs :>
29-11-2019T06:00:37,maku450,but yeah it gets stressful if taken too seriously
29-11-2019T06:00:59,Dadrobit,"Shyvanna/""Powerful"" pick one."
29-11-2019T06:01:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I usually play with a friend maku.  Its just something to do when we chat and goof off
29-11-2019T06:01:18,HeresyArtStream,Only multiplayer game I have been playing a lot lately is Destiny 2. Once in a while Seff gets me to play Space Engineers.
29-11-2019T06:01:24,maku450,mmm
29-11-2019T06:01:47,maku450,"I wish there was more co-op content in cs, would be fun to mess around and not worry :V"
29-11-2019T06:01:53,HeresyArtStream,"Although, my opinion of Space Engineers is that it can be a bit of a slog, and this comes from someone who plays Elite Dangerous and Star Citizen. :V"
29-11-2019T06:02:33,HeresyArtStream,Creative mode is on paper a lot of fun but for me it feels like work.
29-11-2019T06:02:52,Dadrobit,"Ohhhh, I remember Space Engineers. It was fun for an hour or so at a time. But it's definitely not for everyone."

29-11-2019T06:25:35,Dadrobit,I could try. Did a year of choir in college. I can belt out Sinatra pretty well if all else fails.
29-11-2019T06:25:46,TeapotOfDoom,Nice
29-11-2019T06:26:05,MarvTheHugPharaoh,The next time we VC I gotta hear that dad
29-11-2019T06:26:24,Dadrobit,Wanted to learn better voice control. Choir was actually pretty excellent for that.
29-11-2019T06:27:50,Dadrobit,I'll just record something and turn my channel into a Sinatra cover channel.
29-11-2019T06:27:59,TeapotOfDoom,Do it

29-11-2019T06:30:00,TeapotOfDoom,Singing is a lot of fun
29-11-2019T06:30:21,TeapotOfDoom,But i would need to practice way more for it to sound decent
29-11-2019T06:31:11,Dadrobit,"And thus, melodyne was invented."
29-11-2019T06:31:19,TeapotOfDoom,Jup
29-11-2019T06:32:26,TeapotOfDoom,But i will experiment with heavily processed vocals in the near future anyway
29-11-2019T06:32:40,TeapotOfDoom,We'll see how that pans out
29-11-2019T06:33:53,Dadrobit,Good luck
29-11-2019T06:34:31,Dadrobit,Only ever used it myself for guitars actually.

29-11-2019T15:50:27,Ordithus,Sucks
29-11-2019T15:50:35,Sclimshady,"Or wait,  got time zones backwards"
29-11-2019T15:50:50,Titanarisium,I keep forgetting how time zones work
29-11-2019T15:50:56,Titanarisium,Confusing
29-11-2019T15:51:31,SageSaga,time zones do not matter in that math
29-11-2019T15:51:54,Sclimshady,I meant between 730 and stream start
29-11-2019T15:52:26,Titanarisium,oh
29-11-2019T15:52:29,SageSaga,still got 6 hours of sleep- woke up at 2pm
29-11-2019T15:52:47,Sclimshady,6 hours is respectable
29-11-2019T15:53:00,SageSaga,better than most of my days

29-11-2019T15:53:53,Sclimshady,Sounds like you wont take  responsibility w0lf
29-11-2019T15:54:45,SageSaga,i was working on a commission while they streamed- but i cant stream those commissions
29-11-2019T15:54:58,Titanarisium,Not allowed to?

29-11-2019T16:00:43,AnuSekaniArt,Only ever had a GBA game
29-11-2019T16:01:37,SageSaga,i also bought a 55 inch 4k TV- and an arm to mount it onto
29-11-2019T16:01:57,SageSaga,im gonna clean up my room and let them have a movie night sometime when they stay over next time

29-11-2019T16:17:05,SageSaga,I release one update a week for AI and 2 for Yosh!
29-11-2019T16:18:46,Titanarisium,Yosh is another story your working on?

29-11-2019T16:19:35,Titanarisium,My goodness!

29-11-2019T16:20:47,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Heyo o/
29-11-2019T16:20:47,SageSaga,it's also 2283 pages long atm
29-11-2019T16:20:55,Titanarisium,Woah!
29-11-2019T16:21:13,Ordithus,MARV :ctwokinds-statuerawr:
29-11-2019T16:21:18,Titanarisium,Imagine it as a physical book

29-11-2019T16:21:32,Sclimshady,LOTR x 2
29-11-2019T16:21:33,SageSaga,AI is a physical book
29-11-2019T16:21:44,Titanarisium,NANI?!
29-11-2019T16:21:58,SageSaga,Chapters 0-5 is a 170ish page book
29-11-2019T16:22:19,AnuSekaniArt,Remind me to pick one up if I see you at a con ^^
29-11-2019T16:22:48,SageSaga,I'll be at Anthrocon next year with Tom
29-11-2019T16:22:49,Sclimshady,"Sage,  I noticed my copy of AI isnt updating.  Do you do repairs?"
29-11-2019T16:22:58,Titanarisium,Twokinds??
29-11-2019T16:23:04,AnuSekaniArt,Indeed
29-11-2019T16:23:10,SageSaga,Tom of Twokinds- yes
29-11-2019T16:23:23,SageSaga,Sclim- the last page says to go to the website for updates
29-11-2019T16:23:59,SageSaga,the next book will be smaller though so it should cost less but will have 3 chapters instead of 6
29-11-2019T16:24:04,Sclimshady,Do I just plug the book in?
29-11-2019T16:24:15,Titanarisium,plug the book in?
29-11-2019T16:24:24,SageSaga,hes trying to be funny
29-11-2019T16:24:42,Titanarisium,Good art
29-11-2019T16:24:48,Titanarisium,love it
29-11-2019T16:25:05,AnuSekaniArt,So I imagine CH. 6-10 will go into another volume?
29-11-2019T16:25:48,SageSaga,no - 6-8
29-11-2019T16:26:09,SageSaga,6 chapters in a book is really expensive
29-11-2019T16:26:18,SageSaga,and forces the book price up a lot
29-11-2019T16:26:21,AnuSekaniArt,Gotcha
29-11-2019T16:26:44,SageSaga,i should probably be selling my first book for 35-40USD but instead i have it at 30
29-11-2019T16:27:08,SageSaga,im hoping the next book will be sold at 20USD
29-11-2019T16:27:25,SageSaga,a lot more manageable for people to spend 20 dollars on a book than 30-40
29-11-2019T16:27:30,AnuSekaniArt,Indeed
29-11-2019T16:28:31,Titanarisium,Selling books are confusing and i got a feeling its hard

29-11-2019T16:29:13,ThingsAreMoving,<3 people :ctwokinds-nibsbounce:
29-11-2019T16:29:28,Titanarisium,Oh Things
29-11-2019T16:29:30,Sclimshady,:cw0lfmare-HeadEmber:
29-11-2019T16:29:31,AnuSekaniArt,All Things!
29-11-2019T16:29:35,Sclimshady,Happy Ember
29-11-2019T16:29:35,AnuSekaniArt,*Allo
29-11-2019T16:29:46,SageSaga,books are expensive if you dont think you can sell thousands
29-11-2019T16:29:59,SageSaga,if you can sell thousands you can make a ton of money with a huge down payment
29-11-2019T16:30:37,SageSaga,basically- to buy 100 books you are paying over 50% of the price you are probably going to sell them at
29-11-2019T16:30:47,Titanarisium,Spending money to make more money
29-11-2019T16:31:02,Titanarisium,very difficile
29-11-2019T16:31:15,ThingsAreMoving,You have to have a nicely developed franchise and fanbase if you want to sell that amount of books
29-11-2019T16:31:21,SageSaga,but if you buy 5000 books- its going to cost you like 5%
29-11-2019T16:31:53,SageSaga,but you have to buy that many so if you cant sell 5% you are not only losing money- but you have thousands of books in your house XD
29-11-2019T16:32:17,Sclimshady,Make a book fort
29-11-2019T16:32:19,AnuSekaniArt,XD
29-11-2019T16:32:29,ThingsAreMoving,that's a lot of reading
29-11-2019T16:32:37,ThingsAreMoving,:ctwokinds-smug:
29-11-2019T16:33:01,SageSaga,"so i bought 200, i still have plenty left over- which i hope to sell more of at Anthrocon and online"
29-11-2019T16:33:04,Sclimshady,[BOOKS!]*:cw0lfmare-HeadEmber:
29-11-2019T16:33:10,SageSaga,but i expect to sell more when i get book 2
29-11-2019T16:33:24,SageSaga,because people often buy  Book 1 with a Book 2 when its released
29-11-2019T16:34:08,Ordithus,:csagesaga-c4: I'm liking this musac
29-11-2019T16:34:39,Titanarisium,Business
29-11-2019T16:34:46,SageSaga,all my music is good- but that last one was from Chrono Cross
29-11-2019T16:35:15,SageSaga,this one is from Chrono Trigger
29-11-2019T16:35:54,ThingsAreMoving,Chrono Trigger... a jRPG where you eat sticks of butter while travelling in time
29-11-2019T16:36:54,ThingsAreMoving,Still not sure if I prefer Chrono Trigger or Golden Sun
29-11-2019T16:41:56,Titanarisium,For some reason i cant stop staring at that wood
29-11-2019T16:42:05,AnuSekaniArt,I've learned the hard way that hands are hard to draw lol]
29-11-2019T16:42:23,Titanarisium,Hands are very hard
29-11-2019T16:46:11,AnuSekaniArt,Hands and feet
29-11-2019T16:46:53,Kameloh,panels are looking good sage :ckameloh-naokithinky:
29-11-2019T16:47:03,AnuSekaniArt,THey are ^^
29-11-2019T16:47:15,SageSaga,ty ty
29-11-2019T16:47:42,Ordithus,Kaylin is looking cute as ever
29-11-2019T16:47:51,Titanarisium,I dont get panels
29-11-2019T16:48:10,AnuSekaniArt,:csagesaga-kaylinheart:
29-11-2019T16:48:24,Titanarisium,I know most artists would use a max of 6 panels a page
29-11-2019T16:48:57,ThingsAreMoving,There's only so much stuff you can fit on one page
29-11-2019T16:49:12,SageSaga,you have to be careful about the balance of your panels
29-11-2019T16:49:31,SageSaga,the main point is to keep the story flowing while giving impact to the scenes
29-11-2019T16:49:54,SageSaga,so talking scenes like this you can do 6-8 panels no problem
29-11-2019T16:50:30,SageSaga,but action scenes sometimes need a mix of lots of panels or just a few very large panels
29-11-2019T16:51:11,Ordithus,Or a mix of many small panels with one HUGE one
29-11-2019T16:52:17,SageSaga,and then you gotta worry about the flow of panels
29-11-2019T16:52:35,SageSaga,like this 6 panel is easy- left to right - down - left to right- down-
29-11-2019T16:52:57,AnuSekaniArt,Ever have pages that are just one panel?
29-11-2019T16:53:21,SageSaga,but if you have people trapped in a whirlpool- you might have one big panel in thhe center showing a whirlpool- and reaction shots in smaller panels slowly encircling the pool
29-11-2019T16:53:35,SageSaga,only Covers for AI Anu :P

29-11-2019T17:00:42,Titanarisium,rarely snows where i am
29-11-2019T17:00:47,SageSaga,i bought them from another artist. I could make my own but its a lot of work and if someone else already did it- i'd rather just pay them for it XD
29-11-2019T17:01:02,AnuSekaniArt,Yeah I've heard making your own brushes is painful XD
29-11-2019T17:01:07,TeapotOfDoom,sounds like the better option
29-11-2019T17:01:31,Titanarisium,i wonder how one can make their own beush
29-11-2019T17:01:34,Ordithus,Probably easier to make physical brushes than digital
29-11-2019T17:01:42,SageSaga,it's actually pretty easy to make your own brushes
29-11-2019T17:01:46,Ordithus,welp
29-11-2019T17:01:48,SageSaga,ive made several but nothing major
29-11-2019T17:02:39,SageSaga,when i used Photoshop i used to make all my own brushes
29-11-2019T17:02:45,AspiringNoodle,I'm just imagining how creepy junji ito inspired brushes would be
29-11-2019T17:03:32,Titanarisium,Hang on make brushes like tweaking the settings of original brushes or making from scratch?
29-11-2019T17:03:36,TeapotOfDoom,a nyna or kaylin brush would be fun
29-11-2019T17:03:53,SageSaga,both Titan
29-11-2019T17:03:54,AnuSekaniArt,OK just did a little line sketch of my hand. Was nice to get back into the swing of things
29-11-2019T17:04:03,TeapotOfDoom,just pastes an image of one of them
29-11-2019T17:04:34,TeapotOfDoom,would make no sense at all but just for kicks
29-11-2019T17:04:54,Titanarisium,I cant paste and image becuse last time i tried the image itself was the brush
29-11-2019T17:05:12,TeapotOfDoom,wut
29-11-2019T17:05:28,Titanarisium,like i took a pic of a cloud

29-11-2019T17:05:47,TeapotOfDoom,also people join the christmas squad! just shop a cap on your profile pic xD
29-11-2019T17:05:53,Titanarisium,and i pasted it but the whole picture was the brush
29-11-2019T17:05:55,TeapotOfDoom,hiya noodle
29-11-2019T17:05:56,AspiringNoodle,*throws tea bag into Teapot*
29-11-2019T17:05:57,Sclimshady,"Thats how it works,  another artist uses a persons picture as a brush"
29-11-2019T17:06:17,AspiringNoodle,*bag secretly filled with coffee grounds*
29-11-2019T17:06:29,AspiringNoodle,*noodle gets cofveve* :ptv-hearts:

29-11-2019T17:07:49,Titanarisium,Im going to have to Google how to do that
29-11-2019T17:08:02,Titanarisium,You pasted?
29-11-2019T17:08:04,AspiringNoodle,All hail the mighty tree brushes!
29-11-2019T17:08:07,Ordithus,Some of these had to be a ton of work to make
29-11-2019T17:08:29,TeapotOfDoom,now we're talking
29-11-2019T17:08:37,TeapotOfDoom,holy shit what even are these
29-11-2019T17:09:05,AspiringNoodle,"They're pretty, that's what they are!"
29-11-2019T17:09:22,AnuSekaniArt,BRB!
29-11-2019T17:09:31,TeapotOfDoom,the ghost go one is lit
29-11-2019T17:11:12,AspiringNoodle,Bottom left one looks perfect for carnage OwO
29-11-2019T17:11:36,AspiringNoodle,*the bloodlust begins to boil within Noodle*
29-11-2019T17:11:42,TeapotOfDoom,the first thought i had were inksplotches
29-11-2019T17:11:57,TeapotOfDoom,instant laeves
29-11-2019T17:12:00,TeapotOfDoom,leaves
29-11-2019T17:12:19,AspiringNoodle,My mind is blown
29-11-2019T17:12:42,TeapotOfDoom,trees for days
29-11-2019T17:12:47,TeapotOfDoom,happy little trees
29-11-2019T17:13:31,AspiringNoodle,So much wood and foliage :ptv-RainbowThrowup:
29-11-2019T17:13:34,SageSaga,here comes one of my favs
29-11-2019T17:14:06,TeapotOfDoom,holy shit
29-11-2019T17:14:08,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-shock:
29-11-2019T17:14:16,AspiringNoodle,WITCHCRAFT!!!
29-11-2019T17:14:41,Ordithus,Look for the hidden spider
29-11-2019T17:14:50,TeapotOfDoom,find waldo
29-11-2019T17:14:51,MarvTheHugPharaoh,And just like that we have the fields anakin was playing in attack of the clones
29-11-2019T17:14:59,AspiringNoodle,Right now I'm just imagining that's a field a catnip
29-11-2019T17:15:08,AspiringNoodle,And Nyna is trippin' ballz somewhere in there
29-11-2019T17:15:15,SageSaga,is pretty sexy
29-11-2019T17:15:18,TeapotOfDoom,that would be to much
29-11-2019T17:15:26,TeapotOfDoom,sexy brushes
29-11-2019T17:15:55,AspiringNoodle,"[TAKE THAT, TRADITIONAL ART!]*:ptv-angry:"
29-11-2019T17:16:21,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-condescending:*[You've got nothing on this.]
29-11-2019T17:16:36,Ordithus,"Well, you CAN dip a leaf in paint and use it"
29-11-2019T17:16:50,AspiringNoodle,*boom*
29-11-2019T17:16:52,AspiringNoodle,Instant trees
29-11-2019T17:17:07,SageSaga,traditional art did this kinda stuff too
29-11-2019T17:17:34,SageSaga,lots of painters used stencils to fill out backgrounds
29-11-2019T17:17:42,TeapotOfDoom,how would you paste an entire tree in one brush stroke with traditional methods
29-11-2019T17:17:47,AspiringNoodle,^
29-11-2019T17:17:53,SageSaga,Stencils
29-11-2019T17:17:55,TeapotOfDoom,genuinly curious
29-11-2019T17:17:58,TeapotOfDoom,oohhh
29-11-2019T17:18:02,TeapotOfDoom,yeah makes sense
29-11-2019T17:18:05,Ordithus,1. Find Bob Ross painting 2. Steal 3. Stick in background
29-11-2019T17:18:10,TeapotOfDoom,lol
29-11-2019T17:18:14,AspiringNoodle,Wouldn't it still take multiple passes to finish?
29-11-2019T17:18:19,TeapotOfDoom,happy little background
29-11-2019T17:18:37,SageSaga,not always- often you start to lose detail as you go into the background
29-11-2019T17:18:57,SageSaga,so you have a faded color of just green on a tree- even the trunk of the tree- and most people wont notice
29-11-2019T17:19:10,TeapotOfDoom,also color shift
29-11-2019T17:19:34,TeapotOfDoom,*insert any bob ross video with trees*
29-11-2019T17:19:58,AspiringNoodle,Bob Ross was a choice in a Cyanide and Happiness series :P
29-11-2019T17:20:14,TeapotOfDoom,Bob Ross is boss
29-11-2019T17:20:24,AspiringNoodle,"Bob Ross could've been run over by a trolley, lmao"
29-11-2019T17:20:34,AspiringNoodle,Thank goodness the viewers spared him!
29-11-2019T17:20:40,TeapotOfDoom,If I ever get enough money i will 100% buy a bob ross painting
29-11-2019T17:21:08,SageSaga,kinda like that- detailed stuff in front- and just silhouettes in the back
29-11-2019T17:21:13,ThingsAreMoving,Pretty sure he'd prefer you paint one for yourself using his techniques
29-11-2019T17:21:25,AspiringNoodle,Art 101 kinda stuff
29-11-2019T17:21:26,TeapotOfDoom,that's on my bucket list
29-11-2019T17:21:37,AspiringNoodle,Less detail has you go from fore to mid to background
29-11-2019T17:21:46,Sclimshady,Getting an original Bob Ross is hard.  Most cant be verified
29-11-2019T17:21:49,TeapotOfDoom,still wanna have bob painting lol
29-11-2019T17:21:51,AspiringNoodle,Switch to cooler colors to account for atmospheric haze :D
29-11-2019T17:22:12,TeapotOfDoom,@sclim I mean most older paintings have this problme
29-11-2019T17:22:41,AspiringNoodle,"mmmm, sexy trees"
29-11-2019T17:22:45,Sclimshady,"Especially his though, due to all the fan paintings that were really good"
29-11-2019T17:22:49,AspiringNoodle,*imagines rule 34 trees*
29-11-2019T17:22:51,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-shock:
29-11-2019T17:23:04,AspiringNoodle,My mind needs to be punished...
29-11-2019T17:23:04,TeapotOfDoom,I am 100% sure there is r34 of trees
29-11-2019T17:23:14,AspiringNoodle,*grabs flamethrower*
29-11-2019T17:23:18,AspiringNoodle,Time to kill it with fire...
29-11-2019T17:23:20,SageSaga,even with the brushes you still have to know how and when to use them
29-11-2019T17:23:23,TeapotOfDoom,And I am also 100% sure that I don't want to see that
29-11-2019T17:23:47,SageSaga,like i cant use this tree brush for every forest- it's too small and the same thing over and over
29-11-2019T17:23:51,TeapotOfDoom,This quickly turned into Sage doing demo art and i like it
29-11-2019T17:24:00,AspiringNoodle,"Oh yeah, no.  Variety is key"
29-11-2019T17:24:21,AspiringNoodle,Very few areas in the world have homogenous forests.
29-11-2019T17:24:25,SageSaga,"it's ok to use references, it's ok to use brushes to speed up your work"
29-11-2019T17:24:52,SageSaga,brushes wont just make you a better artist- they will just save you some time
29-11-2019T17:25:12,AspiringNoodle,Just another tool in the tool box
29-11-2019T17:25:19,AspiringNoodle,You guys ever watch Jazza?
29-11-2019T17:25:35,sunblaze,going to bed now
29-11-2019T17:25:37,sunblaze,take care

29-11-2019T17:26:02,Sclimshady,Night Sun
29-11-2019T17:27:04,TeapotOfDoom,night sun!
29-11-2019T17:29:11,AspiringNoodle,I remember watching a video last year from Jazza
29-11-2019T17:29:26,AspiringNoodle,He was demonstrating that you don't need the fanciest toys to do digital art
29-11-2019T17:29:46,AspiringNoodle,"He got a cheap $30 tablet (a bamboo if I remember correctly), and did a lovely little nature picture"
29-11-2019T17:31:42,SageSaga,ive seen a few of his videos- the first video he did with Fivver was cool- the second one was sad
29-11-2019T17:32:08,AspiringNoodle,I should see if I can find that video
29-11-2019T17:32:22,AspiringNoodle,He channeled his inner Bob Ross for that picture.
29-11-2019T17:32:28,TeapotOfDoom,post here when found?
29-11-2019T17:32:32,TeapotOfDoom,cus wanna see
29-11-2019T17:32:56,AspiringNoodle,"Sure.  If I remember correctly, the point he was trying to make was that even screenless tablets can make good art."
29-11-2019T17:33:16,TeapotOfDoom,i mean i have a bamboo even if i rarely ever use it
29-11-2019T17:34:07,AspiringNoodle,Found it
29-11-2019T17:34:20,SageSaga,yeah i could totally do the same stuff im doing now with a non-screen tablet
29-11-2019T17:34:32,AspiringNoodle,JAZZA CHANNELING HIS INNER BOB ROSS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osCKMNJB6Sk
29-11-2019T17:34:54,AspiringNoodle,The thumbnail for the video even has his caricature self with Bob Ross styled hair xD
29-11-2019T17:35:28,TeapotOfDoom,one knows bob ross when one sees him
29-11-2019T17:35:42,AnuSekaniArt,Am back :3
29-11-2019T17:35:59,TeapotOfDoom,for the launch of twitch creative they streamed joy of painting for like a week non stop
29-11-2019T17:36:08,AspiringNoodle,"Anu, beware"
29-11-2019T17:36:13,AspiringNoodle,We've gone full Bob Ross
29-11-2019T17:36:18,AspiringNoodle,You missed the best demo evuh
29-11-2019T17:36:32,AspiringNoodle,I think... I'm multitasking hard over here ._.
29-11-2019T17:36:32,TeapotOfDoom,a friend of mine and I put in on during school breaks in class and my english teacher walked in
29-11-2019T17:36:44,AnuSekaniArt,XD
29-11-2019T17:36:58,TeapotOfDoom,she asked what we were watching and we told her bob ross
29-11-2019T17:37:18,AspiringNoodle,What was her reaction?!?
29-11-2019T17:37:21,TeapotOfDoom,first she was mockingly like ha bob ross prolly some modern kids bs then it clicked for her
29-11-2019T17:37:29,AspiringNoodle,lmao
29-11-2019T17:37:59,SageSaga,"""Bob Ross? The  War Veteran?"""
29-11-2019T17:38:19,TeapotOfDoom,she told us that she was in an art focused school and even tried to make an oil painting herself all beit not with his technique
29-11-2019T17:38:36,TeapotOfDoom,you could see her getting 20 years younger it was precious
29-11-2019T17:38:58,TeapotOfDoom,we watched bob ross for the first half of the class
29-11-2019T17:39:35,TeapotOfDoom,Bust 'em up Bobby
29-11-2019T17:39:48,Titanarisium,Bob Ross was a war veteran?
29-11-2019T17:40:02,TeapotOfDoom,jup
29-11-2019T17:40:02,SageSaga,yes
29-11-2019T17:40:16,TeapotOfDoom,he was infamous for being a terribly harsh instructor
29-11-2019T17:40:23,Titanarisium,Oh man.. I did not know that
29-11-2019T17:40:45,TeapotOfDoom,his nickname was Bust 'em up Bobby because he had a tendency for screaming with people
29-11-2019T17:40:46,AspiringNoodle,*tabs back into stream*
29-11-2019T17:40:48,AspiringNoodle,OPPAI!

29-11-2019T17:41:01,AnuSekaniArt,XD
29-11-2019T17:41:21,AspiringNoodle,It feels like I've just been subjected to the animu curse
29-11-2019T17:41:22,SageSaga,i think he said he used Art to calm his mind when he would remember lots of the terrible things he saw
29-11-2019T17:41:27,TeapotOfDoom,but yeah our precious bob once used to be quite the opposite of the person we grew to love him as
29-11-2019T17:41:58,TeapotOfDoom,> be noodle
29-11-2019T17:41:59,SageSaga,i dont know if he actually suffered PTSD but art is used to help people with PTSD
29-11-2019T17:42:06,TeapotOfDoom,> suddenly tiddies
29-11-2019T17:42:20,TeapotOfDoom,i would guess so
29-11-2019T17:42:26,TeapotOfDoom,i mean war is a bitch
29-11-2019T17:42:37,ThingsAreMoving,Art looks calming
29-11-2019T17:42:48,TeapotOfDoom,it fucks the people who don't get killed even more
29-11-2019T17:42:51,ThingsAreMoving,unless you try to get that ONE line perfectly for 1h
29-11-2019T17:43:22,SageSaga,painting is different though- you mess up- you cover it up with a happy little bush or cloud :P
29-11-2019T17:43:58,ThingsAreMoving,true. your biggest concern is to beat the devil out of your brushes
29-11-2019T17:44:09,AnuSekaniArt,I used to joke that one of my roommate's professors was the Bob Ross of computer coding.
29-11-2019T17:44:29,AnuSekaniArt,"""Just a little mistake, that's alright. We'll just make some happy little 'for' loop."""

29-11-2019T17:53:15,TeapotOfDoom,let's see how much i can trash my link
29-11-2019T17:53:26,SageSaga,i thought floatplane was gonna try and do 4k but they didnt think they could do 8k
29-11-2019T17:53:48,TeapotOfDoom,luke said they want to try it specifically for this one
29-11-2019T17:54:00,AspiringNoodle,I hope floatplane succeeds
29-11-2019T17:54:02,TeapotOfDoom,also they want to go upto insane bitrates so we'll see
29-11-2019T17:54:08,AspiringNoodle,"Heck, I hope ANY youtube competitor succeeds"
29-11-2019T17:54:14,TeapotOfDoom,^
29-11-2019T17:54:16,AspiringNoodle,Those dicks need the swift kick in the pants
29-11-2019T17:54:21,SageSaga,yeah but they said on the WAN show last week that they were going to aim for 4k first
29-11-2019T17:54:53,TeapotOfDoom,i don't think that they're implicitly evil but they clearly need competition
29-11-2019T17:55:04,AspiringNoodle,"Oh, no, believe me, they're evil ;)"
29-11-2019T17:55:18,TeapotOfDoom,hmm i saw that one i thought they were working on 8k
29-11-2019T17:55:19,AspiringNoodle,"Blacklists, targeted enforcement, etc"
29-11-2019T17:55:28,TeapotOfDoom,also eyy sage watches wan show sweet
29-11-2019T17:55:43,AspiringNoodle,...all this talk of WAN has me craving jerky for some reason
29-11-2019T17:55:50,AspiringNoodle,Curious...
29-11-2019T17:56:01,SageSaga,im not just an art nerd- im also a tech nerd
29-11-2019T17:56:09,AspiringNoodle,*brofist*
29-11-2019T17:56:10,TeapotOfDoom,mmm no just way to many accs vs to littly staff and bad communication
29-11-2019T17:56:21,TeapotOfDoom,nice
29-11-2019T17:56:31,TeapotOfDoom,Savage jerky?
29-11-2019T17:56:34,SageSaga,my pc is running an RTX 2080 Super and a Ryzen 3900x
29-11-2019T17:56:47,TeapotOfDoom,ooohhhhh
29-11-2019T17:56:50,TeapotOfDoom,siiiiick
29-11-2019T17:56:59,Titanarisium,Dang
29-11-2019T17:57:13,AspiringNoodle,3700x and 2070 supah :D
29-11-2019T17:57:20,Titanarisium,You buly it? or Brought it?
29-11-2019T17:57:26,Titanarisium,Built*
29-11-2019T17:57:33,SageSaga,built it
29-11-2019T17:57:34,TeapotOfDoom,.........4770k and gtx760...
29-11-2019T17:57:37,Titanarisium,Nice
29-11-2019T17:57:45,Titanarisium,I want to build my own too
29-11-2019T17:57:51,AspiringNoodle,Sage gets it
29-11-2019T17:57:55,AspiringNoodle,Best computer is self-built computer
29-11-2019T17:58:00,SageSaga,its funny looking at the stream CPU usage and seeing it at . . . o.2% XD
29-11-2019T17:58:12,SageSaga,0.2%*
29-11-2019T17:58:30,Titanarisium,usage is 0.2?
29-11-2019T17:58:41,SageSaga,for the stream
29-11-2019T17:58:45,TeapotOfDoom,you use nvenc tho otherwise it could not be this low
29-11-2019T17:58:55,Titanarisium,Doesn't sound like much
29-11-2019T17:59:35,SageSaga,i of course use Nvenc but- on my old system it still used 5-8% CPU
29-11-2019T17:59:50,SageSaga,and that CPU was a 7700k
29-11-2019T18:00:42,SageSaga,funny thing- using the GPU to stream- and the fans dont even bother to spin
29-11-2019T18:01:16,TeapotOfDoom,the fans can't be bothered
29-11-2019T18:01:33,TeapotOfDoom,you much did you pay for the entire system?
29-11-2019T18:01:48,SageSaga,2200
29-11-2019T18:02:35,TeapotOfDoom,that's quite the number
29-11-2019T18:02:53,TeapotOfDoom,yet you did not get the 3950X
29-11-2019T18:03:02,SageSaga,it wasnt out
29-11-2019T18:03:09,TeapotOfDoom,you need to upgrade then
29-11-2019T18:03:10,SageSaga,its also 200 dollars more
29-11-2019T18:03:28,TeapotOfDoom,but it's sixteen sweet delicious cores
29-11-2019T18:03:42,AspiringNoodle,I spent a bit more on my computer ._.
29-11-2019T18:03:45,SageSaga,i dont even need the 12 cores im using now XD
29-11-2019T18:03:50,TeapotOfDoom,you know you want it
29-11-2019T18:03:52,TeapotOfDoom,lol
29-11-2019T18:04:04,AspiringNoodle,"teapot, I'm with Sage :P"
29-11-2019T18:04:18,TeapotOfDoom,i know it's pointless
29-11-2019T18:04:19,AspiringNoodle,"Until there is a need for more cores, 12 is more likely than not overkill"
29-11-2019T18:04:21,SageSaga,i do want it though :P
29-11-2019T18:04:26,TeapotOfDoom,damn
29-11-2019T18:04:41,AspiringNoodle,I want to get the last processor generation that will be available for gen 4
29-11-2019T18:04:42,SageSaga,but im happy with what i have
29-11-2019T18:04:43,TeapotOfDoom,12 is so much overkill for normal workloads
29-11-2019T18:05:12,AspiringNoodle,I got the 3700x because I couldn't justify 12 for now
29-11-2019T18:05:35,AspiringNoodle,"8 cores is the most you'll get games to utilize, and even then that's not all modern AAA titles"
29-11-2019T18:06:03,SageSaga,<_< >_> I watch movies sometimes while playing games
29-11-2019T18:06:21,TeapotOfDoom,how does that even work
29-11-2019T18:06:28,TeapotOfDoom,i mean it would depend on the game
29-11-2019T18:06:57,SageSaga,ive got 2 monitors- 3 if you count the tablet
29-11-2019T18:07:02,TeapotOfDoom,just a thought: we could use this chat as a private chat for watching wan lol
29-11-2019T18:07:07,AspiringNoodle,*wants 2nd monitor so bad* :ptv-whiny:
29-11-2019T18:07:13,TeapotOfDoom,if it wasn't at 3am for me -_-
29-11-2019T18:09:17,Titanarisium,You know how much it all cost total?
29-11-2019T18:09:39,SageSaga,???
29-11-2019T18:10:36,Titanarisium,The pc build
29-11-2019T18:10:49,SageSaga,mine? I already said
29-11-2019T18:11:05,Titanarisium,say wha
29-11-2019T18:11:20,Titanarisium,I was probably looking away. I'll scroll up
29-11-2019T18:11:24,SageSaga,2200
29-11-2019T18:11:40,Titanarisium,Oh dang
29-11-2019T18:11:45,Titanarisium,Pricey
29-11-2019T18:11:47,SageSaga,not including monitors tablet keyboard and mouse- because im using those from the old one
29-11-2019T18:12:13,SageSaga,"monitors were 200 each, though the price on my main one is going up- i think its over 300 now"
29-11-2019T18:12:50,SageSaga,Nvidia said mine is confirmed Gsync compatible and the cost of it jumped way up
29-11-2019T18:13:04,SageSaga,then my tablet cost 1000
29-11-2019T18:13:46,TeapotOfDoom,lol well nvidia being nvidia i guess
29-11-2019T18:13:56,SageSaga,btw- i am very poor too- but i just save my money for years and spend it on things i need for my work
29-11-2019T18:14:24,AspiringNoodle,"Sage, I did the same thing for this build"
29-11-2019T18:14:28,SageSaga,its only recently with the book sales ive been able to break through a bit more- still poor though XD
29-11-2019T18:14:53,TeapotOfDoom,i gotta by a book then
29-11-2019T18:14:57,TeapotOfDoom,buy
29-11-2019T18:15:01,TeapotOfDoom,man my spelling today
29-11-2019T18:15:45,SageSaga,https://www.otherworldcomics.net/product/artificial-incident-book-one/
29-11-2019T18:17:55,SageSaga,annnd im done!
29-11-2019T18:18:02,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Very well done Sage
29-11-2019T18:18:10,Ordithus,Nice work!
29-11-2019T18:18:11,TeapotOfDoom,nice
29-11-2019T18:18:21,Sclimshady,Looks great Sage!
29-11-2019T18:18:21,TeapotOfDoom,many wood much wow
29-11-2019T18:18:31,AspiringNoodle,"wood / wood, wood wood again"
29-11-2019T18:18:32,AspiringNoodle,:P
29-11-2019T18:18:32,Ordithus,:csagesaga-c3::beers::csagesaga-kaylinheart:
29-11-2019T18:18:38,Titanarisium,Im buffering
29-11-2019T18:18:38,TeapotOfDoom,no more tech rant me sad...
29-11-2019T18:18:56,Titanarisium,Oh that is pretty nice
29-11-2019T18:19:35,TeapotOfDoom,also I'm building an amd system for a client rn. not sure if it's gonna be a 3700x or a 3900x yet tho
29-11-2019T18:19:58,Titanarisium,You people are going places
29-11-2019T18:20:16,TeapotOfDoom,I'm home rn so going nowhere atm
29-11-2019T18:20:26,Titanarisium,In the future
29-11-2019T18:20:28,SageSaga,wouldnt the 3600x be nearly as good as the 3700x?
29-11-2019T18:20:40,TeapotOfDoom,yeah going back to my flat tomorrow
29-11-2019T18:20:42,SageSaga,from what i saw the difference between the two was marginal considering the price
29-11-2019T18:21:01,TeapotOfDoom,the 3700x is pretty pointless
29-11-2019T18:21:16,TeapotOfDoom,it has a higher base clock but the same boost
29-11-2019T18:21:42,SageSaga,and arent most people able to overclock the 3600x to the 3700x levels?
29-11-2019T18:21:50,TeapotOfDoom,so considering amds very good boosting system they will be very similar in performance tests
29-11-2019T18:21:53,PurpleLemons,:cpurplelemons-winkers:/
29-11-2019T18:21:58,SageSaga,yo Purple!
29-11-2019T18:22:01,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Purp
29-11-2019T18:22:05,Sclimshady,Hi Purp o/
29-11-2019T18:22:11,TeapotOfDoom,well amd drives their cpus on redline
29-11-2019T18:22:17,TeapotOfDoom,so mayyyyybee
29-11-2019T18:22:19,AspiringNoodle,I think you guys are confusing the 3700x for the 3800x
29-11-2019T18:22:20,TeapotOfDoom,hi purp
29-11-2019T18:22:30,SageSaga,i dont think so Noodle
29-11-2019T18:22:31,TeapotOfDoom,oh yeah sorry
29-11-2019T18:22:35,AspiringNoodle,3600X = cherry picked 3600 (6c/12t)
29-11-2019T18:22:37,TeapotOfDoom,no he's right
29-11-2019T18:22:38,Ordithus,yo purp
29-11-2019T18:22:47,TeapotOfDoom,3600x = 6c
29-11-2019T18:22:52,TeapotOfDoom,3700X = 8c
29-11-2019T18:22:56,SageSaga,Gamers Nexus was saying the 3600x was better than the 3700x by price
29-11-2019T18:22:58,TeapotOfDoom,3800X = 8c
29-11-2019T18:23:07,TeapotOfDoom,yeah the value is better
29-11-2019T18:23:18,TeapotOfDoom,but the 3700X still has 2 more cores
29-11-2019T18:23:19,AspiringNoodle,I would hope he was saying the 3600
29-11-2019T18:23:37,TeapotOfDoom,the 3800X is the pointless one
29-11-2019T18:23:38,SageSaga,i might just be adding X to the end of things
29-11-2019T18:23:40,AspiringNoodle,"The 3600 is $200, the 3600 is $250"
29-11-2019T18:23:46,AspiringNoodle,3600X is $250*
29-11-2019T18:23:50,TeapotOfDoom,wait lemme pull up spec sheets
29-11-2019T18:23:59,AspiringNoodle,"The 3600x is the ""why does this exist"" processor, much like the 3800X"
29-11-2019T18:24:11,PurpleLemons,X-treme
29-11-2019T18:24:14,SageSaga,anywho i gotta go cook some Bruner
