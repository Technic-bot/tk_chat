11-03-2019T13:17:37,TerraTheWizard,art can be lewd :ctwokinds-NoraEyebrows:
11-03-2019T15:09:20,SpazztasticKiwi,CM done
11-03-2019T15:10:13,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve not see infinity war black panther or even Thor ragnorok
11-03-2019T15:11:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Endgames coming up though. Anyone else aiming to see
11-03-2019T15:18:47,Twokinds,:ptv-greetings:
11-03-2019T15:22:50,SpazztasticKiwi,We’re likely to try seeing it on some Tuesday over here in tupelo
11-03-2019T15:22:55,SpazztasticKiwi,$5 each
11-03-2019T16:12:26,Twokinds,"Why does everyone youtube video start with ""what's up guys"""
11-03-2019T16:13:30,iliar,Not all.
11-03-2019T16:13:55,Bgrmystr2,"lol, I dunno, there's a bunch of ppl who do that, but it's not everyone"
11-03-2019T16:13:58,Bgrmystr2,sure feels like it sometimes
11-03-2019T16:14:04,tehbear,in the beginning of youtube all videos started with a blue background and white text scrolling upwards made with windows movie maker
11-03-2019T16:14:10,Bgrmystr2,it's just the youtube algorithm really
11-03-2019T16:14:23,Bgrmystr2,bear pls xD
11-03-2019T16:14:50,iliar,And I once recorded a video for YouTube. It is very difficult to start a thought without greeting.
11-03-2019T16:16:11,Azumachan,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
11-03-2019T16:16:26,tehbear,this makes me think of all the ways Deckard Cain in Diablo would greet the player
11-03-2019T16:35:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Not everyone
11-03-2019T16:35:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Ever tried Seán’s intro
11-03-2019T16:47:10,RimaDraws,hi
11-03-2019T17:07:26,SpazztasticKiwi,I imagine Bagheera’s at the other end of the house now
11-03-2019T17:08:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Vacuum was on. He came to sniff when I turned it off. I reach down to pat and he flips
11-03-2019T17:15:57,Bgrmystr2,"""Help!"" Is about the first instance I remember talking to him, Bear."
11-03-2019T17:43:46,RimaDraws,lol
11-03-2019T17:48:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom have you seen Captain Marvel yet
11-03-2019T18:50:19,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
11-03-2019T19:11:35,Mippy,Why am I so excited about Sage’s Kickstarter? :ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
11-03-2019T19:12:04,Ordithus,:csagesaga-c3: why would you not be?
11-03-2019T19:12:34,Mippy,I’m watching it like a hawk!
11-03-2019T19:22:07,unsteddyphoenix,hows it goin lesse...
11-03-2019T19:22:21,unsteddyphoenix,Hmm this kickstarter is NOT SEO OPTIMISED tsk tsk
11-03-2019T19:22:55,unsteddyphoenix,"Huh his highest tier is sold out, how rare."
11-03-2019T19:32:46,Ordithus,"His highest tier is a sketch, so nothing too ambitious"
11-03-2019T19:33:42,Dadrobit,link to the page?
11-03-2019T19:34:00,unsteddyphoenix,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1696155462/artificial-incident-book-one
11-03-2019T19:34:04,Dadrobit,gracias
11-03-2019T19:34:59,Dadrobit,"Yeah, and $55 isn't a hugely unreasonable amount of money or anything."
11-03-2019T19:35:39,unsteddyphoenix,just rare to see the most expensive ones in a kickstarter sold out first
11-03-2019T19:36:04,unsteddyphoenix,I guess Sages fans are pretty diehard
11-03-2019T19:36:20,Ordithus,"In this case, yeah, I would say just that :ctwokinds-wink:"
11-03-2019T19:41:02,Dadrobit,"It's kinda weird pricing he's gone for honestly. $40 for a signature, $15 more and you get a whole sketch thrown in as well. That's a super low jump compared to a project like Tom's where it was an extra $90 over the hard cover. And Sage only offered 20."
11-03-2019T19:41:09,Dadrobit,In the first round and only 10 in the second.
11-03-2019T19:42:18,unsteddyphoenix,Thats a good point. Maybe its the mcdonalds tactic of making your order an expensive product and then making the supersize option really cheap to entice you!
11-03-2019T19:43:42,unsteddyphoenix,"I feel like this ""round 2"" he shouldve made more expensive"
11-03-2019T19:43:52,Dadrobit,"McDonalds in that it's also really inexpensive. He dropped the ball on supply though. It's cool that he's offering it for next to nothing, but my man needs to step up production numbers to take advantage if he's not gonna charge more."
11-03-2019T19:43:53,unsteddyphoenix,"Like, adjust your prices for demand, y'know?"
11-03-2019T19:44:25,unsteddyphoenix,I feel that
11-03-2019T19:44:51,unsteddyphoenix,Lowering prices is a lot easier than raising prices
11-03-2019T19:47:18,Dadrobit,"Yeah, it might entice some folks with the mentality of ""buy while it's low since it's obviously only gonna go up."" But it also runs the risk of ""scummy dude jacking up the prices because he can."""
11-03-2019T19:47:48,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah its a lot harder for fans to ""forgive"" raised prices"
11-03-2019T19:50:01,Dadrobit,I could also see fans who get in on it late seeing the inflated price and trying to go to him through email or something to get the original price. Stressful any way that situation would be handled.
11-03-2019T19:50:29,SpazztasticKiwi,How longs Sage been working
11-03-2019T19:50:57,Dadrobit,Today or all time? All time he's been at it about as long as Tom.
11-03-2019T19:52:14,Dadrobit,"Also, I went back to the old TK Kickstarter and holy crap I forgot how many payment variations Tom offered. Dude ""EA premium bundled"" like a madman."
11-03-2019T19:55:42,RimaDraws,who is diehard?
11-03-2019T19:55:50,unsteddyphoenix,Bruce WIllise
11-03-2019T19:57:21,Dadrobit,"John McClane you mean. Also, it's pretty much the greatest Christmas movie of all time."
11-03-2019T19:58:05,RimaDraws,i saw something about sage's fans are diehard
11-03-2019T19:58:19,RimaDraws,also no not to me it isnt
11-03-2019T19:58:22,RimaDraws,never seen it
11-03-2019T19:58:29,Dadrobit,"Oh, that was about how quickly Sage's highest tier of his Kickstarter sold out."
11-03-2019T19:59:14,RimaDraws,i bought one
11-03-2019T19:59:24,Ordithus,"Not too surprising, really.  His most dedicated fans are the ones who would back quickly"
11-03-2019T19:59:31,Ordithus,:csagesaga-c4:
11-03-2019T19:59:43,RimaDraws,ya i got one of the highest tiers
11-03-2019T20:02:05,Ordithus,Saaame! I just hope it keeps going.  The current average plege is about $50.
11-03-2019T20:02:14,Ordithus,I expect it will slow down...
11-03-2019T20:02:21,Dadrobit,:( no extra monies here. Even been considering dropping Tom's sketch support as well. Trying to save up to build a new computer.
11-03-2019T20:02:26,RimaDraws,well you talk as if die hard fans are bad
11-03-2019T20:03:11,Ordithus,puter for work or for play?
11-03-2019T20:03:38,Dadrobit,Play mostly. A little bit of media editing on the side.
11-03-2019T20:04:18,Dadrobit,Need a new phone as well. My baby is just slowly dying on me.
11-03-2019T20:04:21,RimaDraws,i want to build one soon
11-03-2019T20:04:22,unsteddyphoenix,Thats an extremely worthy goal dad
11-03-2019T20:04:25,unsteddyphoenix,Approve
11-03-2019T20:06:44,Dadrobit,"I want to keep it fairly reasonable, considering something like the Threadripper 2990WX."
11-03-2019T20:07:14,Ordithus,I am behind the times.  I don't even know where that fits in
11-03-2019T20:07:28,Ordithus,I remember when Ryzen came out.  That's the last time I paid attention
11-03-2019T20:09:26,Dadrobit,It was a joke mostly. That thing has like 32 cores and costs around 1700 bucks.
11-03-2019T20:09:45,Ordithus,Daaaaaamn

11-03-2019T20:10:34,RimaDraws,my dream comp cost $1400
11-03-2019T20:11:54,SpazztasticKiwi,I got a baconator
11-03-2019T20:12:25,Dadrobit,"If I ever make a true workstation, (several years out) I'd like to try making a Threadripper build. Entry level TR CPUs are around $650 right now."

11-03-2019T20:14:33,Dadrobit,ALL THE PRODUCTIVITY
11-03-2019T20:17:16,Dadrobit,A few more years and this shit might even be almost affordable to individuals.

11-03-2019T20:20:20,RimaDraws,so much
11-03-2019T20:21:59,Dadrobit,The Ryzen 7 1800X has dropped $250 which is half priced from the original launch only two years ago.
11-03-2019T20:22:45,Dadrobit,"The CPU I'm running now, an FX8350 was $200 at launch and you can pick it up for $65 now https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819113284"
11-03-2019T20:24:43,Dadrobit,Patience is a virtue where CPUs are concerned. But fuck these GPU and RAM prices. Actually disgusting.
11-03-2019T20:25:17,Ordithus,I've got the FX8370 in my desktop! :D
11-03-2019T20:25:46,Ordithus,"Which I can't use, because of 1959 electrical :("

11-03-2019T20:41:09,Ordithus,Basement is supposed to be waterproofed.  This week will be a good test of that... also started demo in the basement

11-03-2019T21:03:27,SpazztasticKiwi,And I found a tiny leather jacket. As in hamster sized - it looks maybe it was a keychain
