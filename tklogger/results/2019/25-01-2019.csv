25-01-2019T00:19:59,ThingsAreMoving,I feel like this page could be split into two separate ones without loosing quality or consistency
25-01-2019T00:20:14,Ordithus,"Granted, he won't finish tongith either..."
25-01-2019T00:20:21,Ordithus,So what am I saying
25-01-2019T00:21:32,Twokinds,I tried making two pages out of this
25-01-2019T00:21:46,CrRAR,mm
25-01-2019T00:21:51,BadFoMo,How did it go?
25-01-2019T00:21:54,Twokinds,But then the pacing was off because the scene had to be stretched over a lot more
25-01-2019T00:22:26,Bgrmystr2,that's why there's a divider in the middle huh
25-01-2019T00:22:32,CrRAR,Seems to work well
25-01-2019T00:22:37,InTheLionsDen,Needed to express this as all happening very quickly.

25-01-2019T00:23:47,ThingsAreMoving,Well it  could've stopped at Rose doing whatever she's doing and continued on panel five

25-01-2019T01:16:25,BadFoMo,...I kind of missed out.
25-01-2019T01:16:31,Bgrmystr2,"Maybe you should read the comic, Fomo"

25-01-2019T01:16:48,SageSaga,but heres the thing- the day BEFORE i posted it-
25-01-2019T01:16:59,SageSaga,i saw a bunch of long posts on Twitter
25-01-2019T01:17:45,SageSaga,"saying we have to stop using the ""Female Dog"" word because its a really hateful word"
25-01-2019T01:18:14,RimaDraws,i agree thank you
25-01-2019T01:18:15,Ordithus,oops

25-01-2019T01:19:12,SageSaga,i dont curse- ive never said it before or even put it in a comic before XD
25-01-2019T01:19:22,RimaDraws,i need to lessen mine
25-01-2019T01:19:27,Ordithus,"I think the farthest Sage has gone in a comic before is ""shit"" if it was even complete"

25-01-2019T01:22:25,RimaDraws,oh well ...

25-01-2019T15:29:45,SageSaga,and i got a bunch of blank stares
25-01-2019T15:29:49,Aphala,Hello fellow meat bags!

25-01-2019T15:30:02,TheWiseMankey,Did any of them mistake it for The Great Mouse Detective? XD
25-01-2019T15:30:05,PaperLungs,Tom is literally artsy Skynet confirmed
25-01-2019T15:30:18,SageSaga,one person thought i meant that - they kept saying it was a movie
25-01-2019T15:30:22,ShadowSoap,Hello Aphala
25-01-2019T15:30:27,Aphala,Hello Shadow
25-01-2019T15:30:44,SageSaga,"i was like ""No it was a show"" and i looked it up and was like ""Yeah here it is!"""
25-01-2019T15:30:54,SageSaga,and i looked into it and was like- it was never shown in the US
25-01-2019T15:31:22,Bgrmystr2,so how did she get it with satellite?
25-01-2019T15:31:30,TheWiseMankey,"Yeah, funny how long it took for a LOT of things to hit American soil."
25-01-2019T15:31:31,Twokinds,I would totally assume you meant The Great Mouse Detective
25-01-2019T15:31:43,ZRO4825,I loved that movie <3
25-01-2019T15:31:51,RimaDraws,is it good?
25-01-2019T15:31:52,TheWiseMankey,I remember early 90s when anime was only on the Sci-Fi Channel.
25-01-2019T15:31:55,ZRO4825,"""Mah foot, mah foot, mah ONLY foot!!!"""
25-01-2019T15:31:59,TheWiseMankey,"Or ""SyFy"" if you wanna be technical."

25-01-2019T15:32:15,Bgrmystr2,"it wasn't that garbage spelling at the time, Mankey"
25-01-2019T15:32:17,PaperLungs,rediscovered my favorite quote while rereading
25-01-2019T15:32:29,PaperLungs,"""In the name of meaningless battle"""
25-01-2019T15:32:48,TheWiseMankey,"Yeah I know, but wanted to clarify what channel it USED to be."
25-01-2019T15:32:49,SageSaga,so i think technically Sherlock Hound was my first anime- but it wasnt really made for japan- it was made for Europe
25-01-2019T15:32:57,Zakuru,lizard ab plate is good
25-01-2019T15:33:03,RimaDraws,^
25-01-2019T15:33:37,TheWiseMankey,"My gateway anime was Pokémon, but discounting that, it was Tenchi Muyo."
25-01-2019T15:33:38,Bgrmystr2,I recall back in.. hmm 2003 or so. I would watch Anime Unleashed on TechTV
25-01-2019T15:33:41,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Lizard bro is :cinfinitedge-LovelyAegis:
25-01-2019T15:33:43,SageSaga,so i still say Project A-Ko was the first anime i ever saw
25-01-2019T15:33:58,Aphala,My first anime was Boy Cow Boop Beep
25-01-2019T15:34:19,Aphala,Dragon Ball  / Z stuck with me though
25-01-2019T15:34:23,ThingsAreMoving,be viewing you cosmos bovine boy

25-01-2019T15:35:01,Aphala,^ You leave that arc out of this!
25-01-2019T15:35:08,Bgrmystr2,I legit have no idea what my first anime was..
25-01-2019T15:35:08,TheWiseMankey,Which one? =P
25-01-2019T15:35:14,Aphala,All of them!
25-01-2019T15:35:16,Aphala,haha
25-01-2019T15:35:44,Bgrmystr2,but I was much more into Anime Unleashed than whatever they had on Cartoon Network.
25-01-2019T15:35:45,Aphala,But the new movie was pretty good. No spoilers.
25-01-2019T15:35:57,Aphala,Toonami ?
25-01-2019T15:36:16,TheWiseMankey,The glory days...
25-01-2019T15:36:16,Bgrmystr2,that wasn't an anime lol :P
25-01-2019T15:36:21,Aphala,ooft
25-01-2019T15:36:23,Aphala,played myself
25-01-2019T15:36:31,TheWiseMankey,Toonami was just the name of the block of time they played anime.
25-01-2019T15:36:39,Bgrmystr2,yeah ^
25-01-2019T15:36:47,Aphala,It was from 4pm until 6/7 in the UK
25-01-2019T15:36:56,Aphala,So back from school just tuned in on it
25-01-2019T15:36:59,Bgrmystr2,"I don't recall what shows they had at the time, Dragonball / dbz for sure"
25-01-2019T15:37:01,Bgrmystr2,but dunno what else
25-01-2019T15:37:12,ZRO4825,"First anime for me was either Ronin Warriors or Sailor Moon. I think Sailor Moon, cuz that's back when they were showing it on the Cartoon Express of a morning before school on the USA channel."
25-01-2019T15:37:16,TheWiseMankey,Googles that one
25-01-2019T15:37:26,TheWiseMankey,Apparently a lot of anime that I'm not familiar with.
25-01-2019T15:37:28,Aphala,There was an anime channel on Sky (UK) that played a lot of the 80s / 90s classic
25-01-2019T15:37:35,Aphala,Then they killed that
25-01-2019T15:37:47,TheWiseMankey,Also is ANYONE else hearing that beeping?
25-01-2019T15:37:58,Twokinds,Back with food

25-01-2019T17:38:45,SageSaga,i just noticed my car is gone
25-01-2019T17:38:53,BadFoMo,GTA?
25-01-2019T17:39:10,SageSaga,i dont play GTA anymore
25-01-2019T17:39:16,SageSaga,hohoho
25-01-2019T17:39:16,CatzArt,Nope someone has stolen sages car
25-01-2019T17:39:17,ZRO4825,"I'm hoping that means someone in your family has it, Sage..."
25-01-2019T17:39:39,BadFoMo,I mean 'Someone stole it?'.
25-01-2019T17:39:42,SageSaga,"i just forgot i dont have a car anymore- looked outside and was like ""Oh no! My car- oh right"""
25-01-2019T17:39:49,BadFoMo,Oh.
25-01-2019T17:39:50,ZRO4825,You don't? o.O
25-01-2019T17:39:52,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
25-01-2019T17:40:02,CatzArt,ha! O.o
25-01-2019T17:40:14,ZRO4825,"I musta missed that, assuming you actually said anything about it previously."
25-01-2019T17:40:15,SageSaga,yeah my parents gave it away to someone who needed it more :D
25-01-2019T17:40:16,Aphala,Sage you should play GTA
25-01-2019T17:40:17,Aphala,:)
25-01-2019T17:40:22,Aphala,So I can gub you
25-01-2019T17:40:26,ZRO4825,"Ahh, that's...nice, I guess? o.O"
25-01-2019T17:40:33,Tharkis,"i'd like it if i could get away without a car, they're a big expense, but i cant lo, not with my commute and my hobbies"
25-01-2019T17:40:33,Aphala,:sunglasses:
25-01-2019T17:40:36,BadFoMo,Does it look like Rose is confessing her love to Trace?
25-01-2019T17:40:53,Bgrmystr2,not.. really
25-01-2019T17:41:02,ZRO4825,"Yeah, not to me either. :x"
25-01-2019T17:41:03,SageSaga,the deal is I basically get to use my mothers car or my grand parents car or my fathers car whenever i need to go anywhere
25-01-2019T17:41:07,CatzArt,I thought it looked like Rose was having a heart attack
25-01-2019T17:41:16,ZRO4825,"Oh...well, I guess that works out well then."
25-01-2019T17:41:35,ZRO4825,"Also, Sage, have you done the Event quest The Greatest Jagras, on MHW?"
25-01-2019T17:41:48,SageSaga,yeah its awesome
25-01-2019T17:41:53,SageSaga,and easy too
25-01-2019T17:42:01,ThingsAreMoving,insect glaive op
25-01-2019T17:42:06,ZRO4825,"Wasn't for me, but with that thing's size, being solo made it kinda rough for me, lol"
25-01-2019T17:42:17,CatzArt,I play MHW sporadically but that game is hard when your on your own
25-01-2019T17:42:31,ZRO4825,"It's so damned huge, with normal Great Jagras speed, kinda hard to get out of range of some of the attacks with CB~"
25-01-2019T17:42:31,SageSaga,i think it's easier solo by a lot
25-01-2019T17:42:43,ZRO4825,"Also, I'm just flat-out not as good as you, so there's that. :P"
25-01-2019T17:43:02,CatzArt,Insect glaive? I just use the longsword
25-01-2019T17:43:20,SageSaga,Mihari and I are basically doing the game hard mode by doing duos
25-01-2019T17:43:37,ZRO4825,I always found the game easier when paired up with someone.
25-01-2019T17:43:58,SageSaga,monsters HP goes up by like 2.6x and resistances go up by like 5x as soon as you go multiplayer
25-01-2019T17:44:08,ZRO4825,"That way the damned monster actually has 3 other targets to focus on so occasionally I can actually get in Super Amped Discharges without having to eat attacks for it, lol"
25-01-2019T17:44:10,SageSaga,so going duos makes it straight up harder than solo
25-01-2019T17:44:53,SageSaga,Zro
25-01-2019T17:45:01,SageSaga,Mihari soloed Extreme behemoth
25-01-2019T17:45:27,TheWiseMankey,Sounds fun.
25-01-2019T17:45:28,ZRO4825,"I guess. I have no problem laying out the damage, so when I have someone else the monster can focus on, I have a way easier time. Survival's my problem. And yep, ya mentioned that before, Mihari's a beast. ^^"
25-01-2019T17:45:52,BadFoMo,"That or; Rose: I have a confession to make, Trace. Saira didn't die that day. Trace: She didn't? Rose: No. Don't you think it's odd that a Keidran could live as lonk as I have? Trace: What does that have to do wiih- Rose: Trace! It's me! Saria!"
25-01-2019T17:46:00,CatzArt,I'll have to muscle my friend to get it on xbox and play it with me then. I still struggle against the T-rex in the great forest
25-01-2019T17:46:00,SageSaga,Mihari is generally better than me - at least when it comes to being aggressive
25-01-2019T17:46:01,RimaDraws,oof ok my comp is being a dummy
25-01-2019T17:46:12,BadFoMo,A little late again; what else is new.
25-01-2019T17:46:50,SageSaga,i'll play safe most of the time
25-01-2019T17:47:10,ZRO4825,"I'm great at aggression. Not so great at surviving my aggression all the time, lmao."
25-01-2019T17:48:17,CatzArt,I wanna get better at using the bow in that game as my giant katana thing only works so well
25-01-2019T17:48:26,ZRO4825,"Was trying to finish off a Kulve Taroth last night solo cuz friends helped start it, and wanted to get it finished. For some reason just could NOT get her down, it was ridiculous."
25-01-2019T17:48:27,SageSaga,my main is the Bow in World
25-01-2019T17:48:47,SageSaga,ive managed to kill Teo in under 3 minutes
25-01-2019T17:48:56,SageSaga,thats probably my best time
25-01-2019T17:49:04,ZRO4825,I can't speed kill. Just doesn't work.
25-01-2019T17:49:10,SageSaga,for elders- i think ive killed Azure in 2 minutes
25-01-2019T17:49:23,ZRO4825,"Unless it's Great Jagras, or on occasion Rathian."
25-01-2019T17:49:42,ZRO4825,"Sometimes I get on a roll and Rathian just doesn't get to get back up, lol"
25-01-2019T17:49:45,SageSaga,Jagras i think i have at like 40 seconds
25-01-2019T17:49:46,CatzArt,I only just got out of the great forest into the desert area so I cant say much
25-01-2019T17:49:58,ZRO4825,"Yeah, you got a LOT of the game left to cover, Catz :)"
25-01-2019T17:50:45,w0lfmare,"Oh dear, still can't catch up on AI"
25-01-2019T17:50:53,CatzArt,I know but I grinded for hours to get a full suit of armor made from that T-rex bloke in the great forest.
25-01-2019T17:50:54,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-nibsdance:
25-01-2019T17:50:58,ZRO4825,I need to quit being lazy and go after Behemoth. I still don't have my Drachen pieces yet on PC and I should get on that.

25-01-2019T17:51:03,Ordithus,Looks like I've made it for the ending
25-01-2019T17:51:10,BadFoMo,Yo.
25-01-2019T17:51:24,ZRO4825,"I tried the lance for the first time the other day and I just do NOT like that weapon, lol"

25-01-2019T17:53:51,Bgrmystr2,besides triangle faces are not bad anyway
25-01-2019T17:53:54,Ordithus,It's a mirror of the old site
25-01-2019T17:54:00,ZRO4825,Hammer is fun sometimes.
25-01-2019T17:54:03,Bgrmystr2,yeah I like the setup of the old site
25-01-2019T17:54:06,SageSaga,did my internet go bleh
25-01-2019T17:54:09,Ordithus,It dif
25-01-2019T17:54:11,Ordithus,did
25-01-2019T17:54:16,BadFoMo,I think so.
25-01-2019T17:54:20,ZRO4825,"Well, your stream stopped for a moment, but it's going again."
25-01-2019T17:54:25,SageSaga,wth was that
25-01-2019T17:54:39,SageSaga,LOL
25-01-2019T17:54:40,CatzArt,Yeah I like a weapon in MHW that has a balance of attack power and mobility and no gimmik so longsword for me
25-01-2019T17:54:42,FoxxTrotter,"Yeah, your stream is still going."
25-01-2019T17:54:45,Bgrmystr2,the new one is all blank white and looks kinda bad
25-01-2019T17:54:55,Bgrmystr2,I'm expecting that's a future fix tho
25-01-2019T17:55:03,SageSaga,my OBS suddenly went in the red and 0/kbs
25-01-2019T17:55:11,BadFoMo,@ZRO4825 Hammer World Editor?
25-01-2019T17:55:15,Ordithus,"Well, seems to be back now"
25-01-2019T17:55:17,Aphala,So...Oblivion is the best elder scrolls game.

25-01-2019T17:55:43,ZRO4825,"No clue what that is BadFoMo, I'm talking MHW, so guessing not."
25-01-2019T17:55:50,CrRAR,lol
25-01-2019T17:55:56,CatzArt,I agree with Alpha. Oblivion is great
25-01-2019T17:55:57,BadFoMo,Oh.
25-01-2019T17:55:59,Bgrmystr2,"was probably catching up, sage"

25-01-2019T18:01:16,unsteddyphoenix,heylo

25-01-2019T18:02:35,CrRAR,sooo satisfying
25-01-2019T18:02:51,CatzArt,I could never get into the lance its to cumbersome I just cant move around well with it
25-01-2019T18:03:07,SageSaga,you arent moving right then

25-01-2019T18:19:17,CatzArt,Markiplier did a few more vids on that game but its not the same without Jack. Hiya Mift
25-01-2019T18:19:21,Ordithus,Hi Miftox!
25-01-2019T18:19:48,SpazztasticKiwi,They get into enough trouble without Seán
25-01-2019T18:20:08,unsteddyphoenix,since basitins are resistant to magic wouldnt maddie resist getting teleported :thinking:
25-01-2019T18:20:16,CrRAR,lol
25-01-2019T18:20:21,CrRAR,Tom mentioned that earlier
25-01-2019T18:20:33,CrRAR,She's weaker and beat up so it's okay
25-01-2019T18:20:38,CrRAR,:ok_hand:
25-01-2019T18:20:53,unsteddyphoenix,"oh interesting, so beating them up makes it easier to spell 'em"
25-01-2019T18:20:59,InTheLionsDen,Their resistance to magic is based on their strength.
25-01-2019T18:21:01,unsteddyphoenix,I see I see~
25-01-2019T18:21:01,Ordithus,she'll just go a bit softer in the head
25-01-2019T18:21:09,CrRAR,Great
25-01-2019T18:21:11,SpazztasticKiwi,She looks in a mirror later and finds her ears have been teleported
25-01-2019T18:21:15,TerraTheWizard,stronker the basitin = more magic resist
25-01-2019T18:21:24,CrRAR,and she has plenty to babble about now after seeing THAT
25-01-2019T18:21:31,Ordithus,But the arms general asploded :thinking:
25-01-2019T18:21:34,w0lfmare,They flex and magic just bounces off
25-01-2019T18:21:40,Miftox01,well I mean there are certain aspects of magic that probably cant be resisted
25-01-2019T18:21:48,CatzArt,all that was left of the arms general was his arms
25-01-2019T18:21:55,TerraTheWizard,oof
25-01-2019T18:21:57,unsteddyphoenix,you assume that was magic ord~

25-01-2019T18:22:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Arms general is dedicated
25-01-2019T18:22:17,SpazztasticKiwi,He’s only arms
25-01-2019T18:22:18,Ordithus,That sounds like a terrible idea Zak
25-01-2019T18:22:23,Zakuru,i need to wake u
25-01-2019T18:22:25,CrRAR,be sure it's the kind with the real GINGER Zak
25-01-2019T18:22:26,Zakuru,up
25-01-2019T18:22:34,Miftox01,like when you magically shoot a rock at someone it is still going to hurt them even if they have a magical resistance
25-01-2019T18:22:36,CrRAR,that'll wake ya gud

25-01-2019T18:32:53,RimaDraws,ouchies for the cyst
25-01-2019T18:33:06,SageSaga,its got a cool name if you split it up - its a ganglion cyst- so if you break it up- its a Gang Lion cyst- which sounds awesome
25-01-2019T18:33:18,Ordithus,ha
25-01-2019T18:33:24,RimaDraws,i hope it gets removed

25-01-2019T18:33:50,SageSaga,im not sure if i want them to remove it or drain it and stunt it

25-01-2019T18:33:57,RimaDraws,bai kiwi
25-01-2019T18:34:05,RimaDraws,i rather it be removed
25-01-2019T18:34:14,SageSaga,if they remove it- it is minor surgery
25-01-2019T18:34:15,RimaDraws,than risk it coming back
25-01-2019T18:34:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom doin the creep
25-01-2019T18:34:31,SageSaga,which has a risk of nerve damage if its in a really bad spot
25-01-2019T18:34:32,SpazztasticKiwi,As normal
25-01-2019T18:34:44,SageSaga,which would kill my career as an artist
25-01-2019T18:34:47,RimaDraws,ew ouch
25-01-2019T18:34:56,SpazztasticKiwi,But bye bye. I doubt I’ll see you later Sage since I don’t get out till 7 so 👋🏻

25-01-2019T18:35:39,SageSaga,its also possible it is nowhere near a nerve but still recovery might take a few days
25-01-2019T18:35:49,SageSaga,*weeks
25-01-2019T18:36:03,RimaDraws,yea that is a problem
25-01-2019T18:36:29,SageSaga,im hoping its easy enough to remove and i will just have to skip a few days- but if not- yikes- i cant miss that much work
25-01-2019T18:36:51,SageSaga,so i would go with drain and shoot steroids into the cyst to stop it from growing
25-01-2019T18:36:55,w0lfmare,Fan comics or draw some filler art beforehand?

25-01-2019T18:38:42,w0lfmare,Draw more while you are in pain?!
25-01-2019T18:39:09,SageSaga,thus - hoping for a short term solution first then maybe setup surgery later
25-01-2019T18:41:15,Bgrmystr2,Honestly I hope it all goes alright for you sage
25-01-2019T18:41:17,CommanderTrace,Hello guys:ptv-greetings: Hello Sage
25-01-2019T18:41:23,SageSaga,yo
25-01-2019T18:41:50,SageSaga,its better than it would have been Bgr regardless- because before - i had no chance of getting any help
25-01-2019T18:41:56,BadFoMo,"I hope you get well so too, Sage."
25-01-2019T18:41:58,SageSaga,i have no health insurance
25-01-2019T18:42:42,SageSaga,the free clinic kicked me out because i should be covered by Medicaid now- but Medicaid is 30 days late accepting me
25-01-2019T18:43:01,SageSaga,they said it would take a month
25-01-2019T18:43:07,SageSaga,that was November 21st
25-01-2019T18:43:20,Ordithus,:ptv-unimpressed:
25-01-2019T18:43:55,SageSaga,so i went to the free clinic basically begging for a refill on my meds that ran out
25-01-2019T18:44:24,Ordithus,How long have you had this cyst?
25-01-2019T18:44:32,SageSaga,6 months
25-01-2019T18:44:41,BadFoMo,Dang!
25-01-2019T18:44:45,RimaDraws,oh no
25-01-2019T18:44:58,SageSaga,"its only gotten bigger and more painful over time- the first month or two it was like ""oh- what a cute little bump!"""

25-01-2019T18:46:15,unsteddyphoenix,Im afraid for the stage after that...
25-01-2019T18:47:06,SageSaga,the cyst can only grow so much- it cant be strong enough to separate my bones!... right?
25-01-2019T18:47:16,Ordithus,:ptv-uneasy:
25-01-2019T18:47:21,unsteddyphoenix,[1 week later~]
25-01-2019T18:47:42,ThingsAreMoving,Better don't smash it with a book to find out
25-01-2019T18:47:46,Ordithus,"The cyst takes over, and the Sage we knew and loved is replaced my a hungry, marauding bundle of cells"
25-01-2019T18:47:48,sunblaze,hiya
25-01-2019T18:47:53,SageSaga,most likely its grown to the point where its pushing something into a nerve
25-01-2019T18:47:54,Ordithus,Hi sun
25-01-2019T18:48:07,BadFoMo,Yo.
25-01-2019T18:48:19,Ordithus,"So, you have a doctor visit set up, or this is still waiting on Medicaid?"
25-01-2019T18:48:22,ThingsAreMoving,"So, what's the cost of removing that cyst?"
25-01-2019T18:48:46,SageSaga,when i stop drawing i move my hand to a rested state that doesnt feel pain
25-01-2019T18:49:17,SageSaga,the Free Clinic took me back temporarily
25-01-2019T18:49:49,Ordithus,"Ah, good?"
25-01-2019T18:50:53,unsteddyphoenix,Nice! :D
25-01-2019T18:51:13,SageSaga,"well in the UK it would cost around 2,000 USD"
25-01-2019T18:51:20,SageSaga,so in the US probably 4k
25-01-2019T18:52:04,ThingsAreMoving,That's quite a lot of bling
25-01-2019T18:52:40,SageSaga,they still estimate recovery time at 2-6 weeks- yikes
25-01-2019T18:53:01,ZRO4825,Yowch.
25-01-2019T18:53:08,ThingsAreMoving,That usually depends on the severity
25-01-2019T18:53:11,ZRO4825,"Enforced break from the comic for once, then? :x"
25-01-2019T18:53:28,SageSaga,T_T i dont wanna
25-01-2019T18:53:40,ThingsAreMoving,in your case could be a matter of removing the pressure and your wrist should heal quickly
25-01-2019T18:53:50,ZRO4825,"I can understand that, you've always been big on keeping your update schedule."
25-01-2019T18:53:53,sunblaze,neither do we but you should set your helth first!
25-01-2019T18:53:58,Ordithus,Glad that at least you have an option
25-01-2019T18:54:01,unsteddyphoenix,medically enforced break lol
25-01-2019T18:54:13,unsteddyphoenix,A break like that could lose him readers though :/
25-01-2019T18:54:26,ZRO4825,How to get Sage to take a vacation: Break his wrist.
25-01-2019T18:55:04,ZRO4825,"Get Fluff to draw your comic in the meantime, Sage! He keeps commenting about needing to work on his speed! :P"
25-01-2019T18:55:11,Ordithus,Haha
25-01-2019T18:55:12,ThingsAreMoving,"Go set a gofundme page to get resources for quick surgery, you have quite a big community over here."
25-01-2019T18:55:25,SageSaga,i would have to discuss it with my patrons
25-01-2019T18:55:36,ZRO4825,You already are o_o
25-01-2019T18:55:41,sunblaze,indeed
25-01-2019T18:55:44,SageSaga,all of them
25-01-2019T18:56:15,SageSaga,if i lose a few key people over a month vanishing- well i wouldnt be able to live anymore off of what i make
25-01-2019T18:56:32,ZRO4825,;_;
25-01-2019T18:56:40,SageSaga,im legit on the edge - if i lose around 150 dollars a month - im done
25-01-2019T18:56:56,sunblaze,graby sage. don't wanna let go!
25-01-2019T18:56:58,SageSaga,i cant support myself and would have to get another job- and that would kill updates
25-01-2019T18:57:09,Ordithus,"Speaking for myself, I'll stick it out"
25-01-2019T18:57:20,sunblaze,seconded
25-01-2019T18:57:25,ZRO4825,"I'm a stubborn ass, so I'm still here. o_o/"
25-01-2019T18:57:44,ZRO4825,"I signed up to support one of my fave artists, not just to get updates."
25-01-2019T18:58:44,SageSaga,i could still type my stories while down a few weeks - i can type with my left hand with little issue
25-01-2019T18:59:03,sunblaze,ohhh thats cool then
25-01-2019T18:59:16,Ordithus,How well can you draw lefty?
25-01-2019T18:59:19,SageSaga,learning to draw with my left would take years
25-01-2019T18:59:30,Ordithus,I suppose
25-01-2019T18:59:44,SageSaga,i can draw a little left handed- i have very good control with my left hand- but it doesnt have the finer movement ive learned with my right
25-01-2019T19:00:20,SageSaga,im sorta ambidextrous - but a lot of drawing is muscle memory like stuff that isnt in my left because i didnt train it
25-01-2019T19:01:02,Ordithus,"It would be super frustrating, but I bet you could learn to draw lefty more quickly than years"
25-01-2019T19:02:27,CatzArt,what song is this Sage?
25-01-2019T19:02:45,ZRO4825,"To get it up to the same level as his right would take years though. He's been drawing righty now for...what, 20+ years, Sage?"
25-01-2019T19:03:09,Bgrmystr2,lol Catz
25-01-2019T19:03:16,Bgrmystr2,This is the theme to Restraunt to Another World
25-01-2019T19:03:28,Bgrmystr2,the OP if I recall correctly
25-01-2019T19:04:07,CatzArt,Oh I've been meaning to watch that anime but goblin slayer and that time I got reincarnated as a slime got in the way
25-01-2019T19:04:21,Bgrmystr2,"It's not bad, honestly."
25-01-2019T19:04:36,SageSaga,its cute and fun and short
25-01-2019T19:04:38,unsteddyphoenix,Draw with your mouth?
25-01-2019T19:04:54,Bgrmystr2,"I don't really get the whole food angle myself, it's just food, but yeah I enjoyed it even so."
25-01-2019T19:05:05,SageSaga,and ive been drawing since i remember
25-01-2019T19:05:29,SageSaga,i know my mother could only keep me quite and still in church on sundays if i had a sketchbook
25-01-2019T19:05:47,SageSaga,problem was i would fill a 100 page sketch book in about a week or 2
25-01-2019T19:05:56,Ordithus,"Na, unsteddy, wired direct to the brain.  Draw with the MIND"
25-01-2019T19:06:15,ZRO4825,If we could do that I might actually be able to draw :joy:
25-01-2019T19:06:24,unsteddyphoenix,just print our thoughts?
25-01-2019T19:06:30,CatzArt,Hah I wish I got that early of a start with art sage. My mother just gave me a gameboy to keep me still in church
25-01-2019T19:06:34,unsteddyphoenix,~Cyberpunk 2077~
25-01-2019T19:06:53,ZRO4825,"I just got told to sit still and be good, lol"
25-01-2019T19:06:54,CatzArt,agh Dishonored!
25-01-2019T19:07:59,CatzArt,Still I'm glad that I started doing art again after so many years of quiting.
25-01-2019T19:08:27,SageSaga,there was a few years where i wasnt drawing as much
25-01-2019T19:08:46,SageSaga,thats when the migraines and hallucinations started
25-01-2019T19:08:59,Ordithus,Oh what fun
25-01-2019T19:09:18,CatzArt,still being able to fill up a sketch book in 2 weeks is impressive. SO sage went through artist withdraw without doing art?
25-01-2019T19:09:37,unsteddyphoenix,hallucinations...
25-01-2019T19:09:48,CatzArt,still takes me a year or more to fill a sketch book. Normally with just half finished doodles
25-01-2019T19:09:53,SageSaga,"freaked my mom out when i started yelling ""HELP HELP! MY HANDS WONT STOP GROWING! IM GOING TO BE STUCK IN MY ROOM! THEY WILL BE TOO BIG TO FIT OUT THE DOOR!"""
25-01-2019T19:09:57,Ordithus,I think i remember you talking about the migraines and hallucinations before
25-01-2019T19:10:18,CatzArt,Oh thats crazy Sage
25-01-2019T19:10:33,ThingsAreMoving,You foretold your own cyst?
