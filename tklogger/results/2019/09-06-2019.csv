09-06-2019T00:13:54,SpazztasticKiwi,I just had a funny thought
09-06-2019T00:14:11,SpazztasticKiwi,How come they always terrorize New York or LA
09-06-2019T00:14:52,SpazztasticKiwi,If Loki had shown up and screamed for everyone to kneel in Texas or somethin I bet it wouldn‚Äôt take half a minute till someone shot at him
09-06-2019T00:19:11,SpazztasticKiwi,anyway back to paint
09-06-2019T00:24:38,AspiringNoodle,I just had my mind blown...
09-06-2019T00:24:50,AspiringNoodle,The hype train for Cyberpunk 2077 just went off the rails

09-06-2019T00:42:34,AspiringNoodle,There's a new game coming out for xbox / PC
09-06-2019T00:43:06,AspiringNoodle,"It's called Spiritfarer, and it has a pretty anthropomorphic deer."
09-06-2019T00:43:39,AspiringNoodle,Trailer suggest prepare your tears.
09-06-2019T00:45:34,SpazztasticKiwi,eh I watched bambi
09-06-2019T00:53:28,Dadrobit,Just looked it up. Learn how to say goodbye. How about no. No more feels for me thank you.
09-06-2019T00:54:27,Dadrobit,"Also, can confirm, there's already porn of it. Internet never changes."
09-06-2019T00:54:43,AspiringNoodle,...OH DEAR GOD
09-06-2019T00:54:47,AspiringNoodle,"WOOLOO, NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO"
09-06-2019T00:54:52,Dadrobit,DEER GOD*

09-06-2019T00:55:09,AspiringNoodle,Also :ptv-unimpressed:
09-06-2019T00:56:00,AspiringNoodle,"Also, can I just complain how I'm tired of politics creeping into literally EVERYTHING these days?!?"
09-06-2019T00:56:28,AspiringNoodle,"Apparently you can't say or type ""Naga[s]"" on Twitch anymore..."
09-06-2019T00:57:23,AspiringNoodle,"If I wanna talk about evil snek people from World of Warcraft, I'm gonna talk about evil snek people from World of Warcraft :ptv-unimpressed:"
09-06-2019T00:59:49,Dadrobit,"League streamer got banned a few weeks back for saying ""Fuckin' Yikers"" because he mumbled a bit and it kinda almost sounded racist."
09-06-2019T01:00:34,AspiringNoodle,...Ever have one of those years where you kinda want to watch the world burn?
09-06-2019T01:00:56,AspiringNoodle,I'll bring the :popcorn:
09-06-2019T01:01:54,AspiringNoodle,"On the bright side, if gamers end up being pulled into this BS, you KNOW which way things are going to swing, and it won't be in the company's favor, I'll tell you that much."
09-06-2019T01:08:27,AspiringNoodle,Look at a picture of Kat.  I'm much happier now :ptv-hearts:
09-06-2019T01:25:52,SpazztasticKiwi,why are blue eyes considered so pretty
09-06-2019T01:28:33,DarthRexKing,Bye!
09-06-2019T01:29:59,AspiringNoodle,"If I recall correctly, blue is the most popular color across the entire planet.  And it's likely tied to the color of the sky."
09-06-2019T01:43:27,SpazztasticKiwi,but green is the rarest and there‚Äôs more shades of brown
09-06-2019T01:44:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Se√°n‚Äôs blue should be illegal. I don‚Äôt see how they‚Äôre that blue

09-06-2019T11:01:21,TerraTheWizard,lol
09-06-2019T11:02:28,AspiringNoodle,She doesn't look too terribly disappointed~
09-06-2019T11:03:27,Orthonox,Gotta make the best out of your sexiness.
09-06-2019T11:21:58,SpazztasticKiwi,maybe she just doesn‚Äôt like blondes
09-06-2019T11:22:33,AspiringNoodle,"I imagine her thoughts are more along the lines of: ""Oh boy, I got purchased by NOT-TRACE -_-"""
09-06-2019T11:22:56,AspiringNoodle,But then she sees all the jewelry and the couch and the paintings
09-06-2019T11:23:46,AspiringNoodle,"Btw, if anyone is interested in discount software, Affinity Photo is currently on sale for $40 instead of $50 (WOO, $10!!!).  The sale ends on the 19th, and you can get a 10-day trial."

09-06-2019T13:23:21,AspiringNoodle,It's a photoshop competitor
09-06-2019T15:34:38,AspiringNoodle,Well eff me I guess.
09-06-2019T15:35:16,AspiringNoodle,For some reason my system does NOT want to play video through my gpu.  So right now I'm hooked up using my xbox's hdmi cable using my cpu's on-board graphics xD
09-06-2019T16:00:43,Bgrmystr2,your gpu might be ded
09-06-2019T16:01:40,AspiringNoodle,"I don't think it's that.  I've tried using both my 970 AND my 560, and both have their fans start up, but still get no signal output."
09-06-2019T16:03:43,Bgrmystr2,fans are irrelevant dude
09-06-2019T16:04:01,Bgrmystr2,just cuz the fan turns on doesn't mean the data is sending for video
09-06-2019T16:04:11,SpazztasticKiwi,nah focus on the fans. Forget the heaters
09-06-2019T16:04:24,SpazztasticKiwi,ü•Å
09-06-2019T16:04:39,Bgrmystr2,"forget the part that actually, you know.. makes the GPU be a GPU, too."
09-06-2019T16:05:35,AspiringNoodle,"Point is, I KNOW the 560 is good.  That thing is in storage as a backup.  And the fact that I'm having the exact same issue tells me there's something else going on."

09-06-2019T20:55:42,AspiringNoodle,"Still not fixed!!! I got a workaround, but it's crappy!  And if my next few things can't fix it, I'm forced to bring my only PC to the friggin' shop!"

09-06-2019T21:39:25,Dadrobit,Got the remaster of it a while back. It's so good~
09-06-2019T21:39:52,Ordithus,I've thought about starting it up again after finishing BOTW...
09-06-2019T21:40:11,Dadrobit,"Oh, and FFVIII is getting a remaster finally as well."

09-06-2019T21:41:27,Dadrobit,Tactics is my absolute favorite. Bar none the best FF game for me.

09-06-2019T21:44:44,Dadrobit,"IIRC it was just a drive failure, so  a couple bucks and a couple minutes of formatting and I could get it back, but I just haven't found time."
09-06-2019T21:45:35,Ordithus,I wonder if my brother's ps1 is still at the parents' house :ctwokinds-floraquestion:
09-06-2019T21:45:43,RimaDraws,i have my ps2 still
09-06-2019T21:45:48,AspiringNoodle,RIP me.
09-06-2019T21:46:10,AspiringNoodle,Can't even install Nvidia drivers in safe mode.  My system legitimately cannot see that slot.
09-06-2019T21:46:45,AspiringNoodle,"I'm not entirely sure this is a GPU issue, but it definitely is manifesting as such."
09-06-2019T21:46:58,Ordithus,tried reseating it?
09-06-2019T21:47:15,AspiringNoodle,"Between 2 different GPUs, monitors, 3 different cables, and 3 different power cable arrangements, my system will NOT recognize any video card I have."
09-06-2019T21:47:23,Ordithus,ah
09-06-2019T21:47:59,AspiringNoodle,"Tried slapping in my GTX 560, nothing.  970, nothing.  Other 2 DisplayPort slots?  HDMI? Nothing."
09-06-2019T21:48:50,AspiringNoodle,"Part of me wants to say eff it, as long as I can browse the internet and use these art programs, I have nothing to lose from not having a GPU."
09-06-2019T21:49:11,Ordithus,didn't you say you were building a new system?
09-06-2019T21:49:20,AspiringNoodle,"Another part of me says that I REALLY want to know exactly what the problem is, so I can potentially scrap some parts and sell others."
09-06-2019T21:49:30,AspiringNoodle,"Yeah, Zen 2 goes on sale 7/7 with Navi."
09-06-2019T21:49:50,AspiringNoodle,This is supposed to be a handmedown / giveaway pc.
09-06-2019T21:50:23,AspiringNoodle,"What's really annoying is that while my system's like this, I'll be limited to 1080p on a 27"" 1440p monitor."
09-06-2019T21:52:03,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-unimpressed: oh no poor you
09-06-2019T21:53:16,AspiringNoodle,That's the minor complaint :P
09-06-2019T21:54:18,Bgrmystr2,"1080p.. very unquality, much low resolution. many wow. :v"
09-06-2019T21:54:32,AspiringNoodle,"At 27"" it's noticeable."
09-06-2019T21:54:51,AspiringNoodle,"But like I said, the bigger issue is that I'm limited to Intel's HD Graphics from end of 2012 :/"
09-06-2019T21:55:10,Ordithus,eh it works
09-06-2019T21:55:23,Bgrmystr2,"Dude I'm running a 19, a 27, a 37, and a 40."
09-06-2019T21:55:23,Ordithus,at least your screen isn't jittering all over the place
09-06-2019T21:55:27,Bgrmystr2,all on 1080p
09-06-2019T21:55:31,Bgrmystr2,No it's not noticable.
09-06-2019T21:55:36,AspiringNoodle,Distances for each?
09-06-2019T21:55:57,Bgrmystr2,no more than 3foot for the 40. If that.
09-06-2019T21:55:59,Bgrmystr2,maybe 2 1/2
09-06-2019T21:56:07,AspiringNoodle,And believe me when I say you WILL notice a difference if you suddenly go from 1440p to 1080p with no distance or screen-size change.
09-06-2019T21:56:10,Bgrmystr2,I'd need to be less than 1 foot away to see the pixels.
09-06-2019T21:56:15,Ordithus,but we already know you're blind
09-06-2019T21:56:16,Ordithus,so
09-06-2019T21:56:22,Bgrmystr2,No I won't because I've seen 1440p monitors.
09-06-2019T21:56:31,AspiringNoodle,"Well, you won't but I do."
09-06-2019T21:56:38,Bgrmystr2,I think it's in your head xD
09-06-2019T21:57:07,AspiringNoodle,"No it's not... when I hooked up the CPU's graphics, everything got blurrier."
09-06-2019T21:57:22,AspiringNoodle,I've even noticed aliasing in images
09-06-2019T21:57:49,Bgrmystr2,then it's not actually 1080p or something else is making it fuzzy.
09-06-2019T21:58:07,AspiringNoodle,It's 1080p on a 1440p monitor.
09-06-2019T21:58:17,AspiringNoodle,It's not a perfect scaling.
09-06-2019T21:58:19,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-rainehappy: fuzzy isn't all bad
09-06-2019T21:58:23,Bgrmystr2,Ord pls xD
09-06-2019T21:58:26,AspiringNoodle,Raine is best fuzzy
09-06-2019T21:58:44,Bgrmystr2,"Meh, keep yer Raine :P"
09-06-2019T21:59:07,Ordithus,Sadly she only sees the fuzzy side as a bad thing
09-06-2019T21:59:15,Ordithus,Not as insulation for winter
09-06-2019T21:59:22,AspiringNoodle,"But yeah... I think I'm done freaking out now.  As long as I can watch my videos, streams, and play around in art programs, the computer will work for now."
09-06-2019T21:59:48,AspiringNoodle,I don't really plan on playing PC games until this backlog has had serious progress made.
09-06-2019T22:00:21,AspiringNoodle,That said... it's bugging me.  I want to know EXACTLY what's wrong with this computer...
09-06-2019T22:03:10,AspiringNoodle,"Bgr, any other hunches as to what the problem could be?"
09-06-2019T22:03:38,AspiringNoodle,I wonder if the traces could've gone bad.
09-06-2019T22:07:27,Bgrmystr2,did you try replacing and then reinserting the blue triangle?
09-06-2019T22:07:46,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
09-06-2019T22:08:10,AspiringNoodle,"""What triangle?"""
09-06-2019T22:08:32,Bgrmystr2,found the problem.
09-06-2019T22:09:35,Ordithus,"psu, psu cable, cpu, mobo"
09-06-2019T22:09:46,Ordithus,or windows just hates you
09-06-2019T22:09:58,AspiringNoodle,"Well, at least you have a similar list xD"
09-06-2019T22:11:04,AspiringNoodle,"I would say GPU, but like I said, this problem started with the GTX 970, and when I plugged in the GTX 560 (which had been sitting in a box since the last time I pulled it out and verified it worked), I was getting the exact same issue."
09-06-2019T22:15:16,SpazztasticKiwi,üõå
09-06-2019T22:15:38,SpazztasticKiwi,night Tom
09-06-2019T22:33:12,AspiringNoodle,I've now moved and/or copied everything from my desktop that is worth saving for the new computer.
09-06-2019T22:33:21,AspiringNoodle,I am now prepared for my computer to completely die :P
09-06-2019T22:33:49,AspiringNoodle,*inb4 cpu not detected*
09-06-2019T22:34:55,Ordithus,oooh that one is familiar
09-06-2019T22:35:30,AspiringNoodle,It's crazy how much society revolves around computers these days.
09-06-2019T22:38:00,AspiringNoodle,"Let's see... in 6.5 years, this computer has seen 2 dead SSDs, and 2 black screen instances.  1 resolved, 1 not :P"
09-06-2019T22:38:33,AspiringNoodle,It seems to love its hardware issues.
09-06-2019T22:42:15,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
09-06-2019T22:43:12,AspiringNoodle,Sweet dreams~
09-06-2019T22:43:25,RimaDraws,ni ord
09-06-2019T22:43:26,AspiringNoodle,May we suffer no more hardware failures in the near future :ptv-hearts:
09-06-2019T22:49:22,RimaDraws,night all!
09-06-2019T22:49:28,AspiringNoodle,Night!
09-06-2019T23:30:55,Bgrmystr2,it's not likely 0.4% of 1.1%
09-06-2019T23:31:01,Bgrmystr2,..thanks picarto.
09-06-2019T23:31:20,AspiringNoodle,The Reni curse
09-06-2019T23:31:23,AspiringNoodle,It lives.
09-06-2019T23:31:25,Bgrmystr2,lol no.
09-06-2019T23:42:22,Dadrobit,Wtf. Just got to work and I noticed a little blister on my index finger that was a little painful.
09-06-2019T23:43:00,Dadrobit,I gave it a squeeze and *pop* out squirts a half inch long splinter.
09-06-2019T23:43:24,AspiringNoodle,Yikes
09-06-2019T23:43:35,Dadrobit,I have no idea how it got there or how long it's been in there.
09-06-2019T23:43:46,AspiringNoodle,Blisters: Nature's splinter removal.
09-06-2019T23:44:19,Dadrobit,It was super skinny and uncomfortably long.
09-06-2019T23:57:59,metalman20,is anyone here?
09-06-2019T23:58:36,AspiringNoodle,"Always, all the time.  You missed the fun earlier.  All the talk about hardware failures :ptv-greetings:"
09-06-2019T23:59:07,metalman20,"aw man, well i was at work for the last 8 plus hours so it's just good to be home"
