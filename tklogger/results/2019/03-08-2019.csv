03-08-2019T13:14:26,IronHorseComics,"if keidrans wanted to wear shoes, how would they make shoes that fit their feet?"
03-08-2019T13:17:34,IronHorseComics,"by make, I mean design"
03-08-2019T13:18:59,Mikemkke034,How is everyone today?
03-08-2019T13:19:07,TerraTheWizard,somethung like this https://twitter.com/fluffkevlar/status/1143285011958894595
03-08-2019T13:19:11,TerraTheWizard,*something
03-08-2019T13:19:39,Sclimshady,"Dang, That was on point"
03-08-2019T13:19:51,Mikemkke034,It would work
03-08-2019T13:20:02,IronHorseComics,"okay, now how would that translate into, say, sneakers?"
03-08-2019T13:20:15,Mikemkke034,Just that but lowcut?
03-08-2019T13:20:29,IronHorseComics,probably
03-08-2019T13:20:54,Mikemkke034,Makes much more sense
03-08-2019T13:22:21,TerraTheWizard,"if you want easy references for ditigrade shoes you can get the digitigrade feet mod for skyrim then play ""fashionsouls"" but skyrim"
03-08-2019T13:24:25,Mikemkke034,Lol
03-08-2019T13:24:46,TerraTheWizard,"also if you know what sites to look on, check out the tag ""furgonomics"""
03-08-2019T13:25:09,TerraTheWizard,basically a tag for images that have clothes designed with anthro characters in mind
03-08-2019T13:25:56,Fjellrev,Hello chat. Hi Tom! I have a strange problem: not one video of Tom`s does not load (three random streamers too). It's some kind of fault on Picarto or this problem just me?
03-08-2019T13:26:34,TerraTheWizard,picarto issue
03-08-2019T13:28:54,Mikemkke034,I hate it. Been trying to rewatch Fridays stream
03-08-2019T13:32:26,AspiringNoodle,Picarto is gar-
03-08-2019T13:32:32,AspiringNoodle,suddenly disappears from existence.

03-08-2019T13:32:45,Yevni,shurgs
03-08-2019T13:33:45,TerraTheWizard,if you want to watch the streams and the picarto vods have borked you can use the youtube archive
03-08-2019T13:33:46,TerraTheWizard,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqz85zfWtK5NzXmSV-WSSBg
03-08-2019T13:38:25,WereKeidran,peeks in to see the early arrivals

03-08-2019T13:40:46,WereKeidran,hello
03-08-2019T13:41:24,Mikemkke034,Heyo
03-08-2019T13:53:33,AspiringNoodle,I wish I had a second monitor just so I could watch streams while doing other things xD
03-08-2019T13:54:15,Mikemkke034,"I use my phone, so I have to prioritize what I want. Lmao"
03-08-2019T14:00:56,BadFoMo,I was a little peved at Picarto messing up the videos too.
03-08-2019T14:01:56,Mikemkke034,Yeah. Sucks
03-08-2019T14:03:08,BadFoMo,"I mean, there have been two (2) times I wanted to watch/record one of Sage's videos and /both/ times when I finally have time to do it, Picarto borks them!"
03-08-2019T14:03:31,AspiringNoodle,I missed tom doing wood flooring last stream
03-08-2019T14:03:39,AspiringNoodle,That's something I really wanted to see him do
03-08-2019T14:04:38,BadFoMo,"Picarto, you are making me thing that everyone is wrong and that YouTube streaming /might/ be better."
03-08-2019T14:05:21,AspiringNoodle,"Twitch is shite, Youtube is shite"
03-08-2019T14:05:32,AspiringNoodle,"Mixer might be good, we'll see how they handle politics"
03-08-2019T14:05:37,Mikemkke034,Yeah
03-08-2019T14:05:44,Mikemkke034,I use Picarto mainly
03-08-2019T14:06:03,AspiringNoodle,"Seriously, when politics is a major concern on streaming platforms that are mainly for gaming, they're just done"
03-08-2019T14:06:04,BadFoMo,Mixer?
03-08-2019T14:06:14,AspiringNoodle,Microsoft's foray into streaming
03-08-2019T14:06:21,BadFoMo,Thanks.
03-08-2019T14:06:24,AspiringNoodle,"They signed Ninja as an exclusive streamer, this is stupidly big news!"
03-08-2019T14:06:40,BadFoMo,Who?
03-08-2019T14:06:44,AspiringNoodle,Ninja
03-08-2019T14:06:49,BadFoMo,Who?
03-08-2019T14:06:49,AspiringNoodle,THE biggest Fortnite streamer?
03-08-2019T14:07:11,AspiringNoodle,A guy who has 10's of thousands of viewers any given stream?
03-08-2019T14:07:11,BadFoMo,Not into Fortnite.
03-08-2019T14:07:14,Mikemkke034,I don't watch Fortnite. Nor do play it
03-08-2019T14:07:15,AspiringNoodle,If not hundreds
03-08-2019T14:07:20,Mikemkke034,Same Fomo
03-08-2019T14:07:28,AspiringNoodle,"I tried it, didn't care too much for it"
03-08-2019T14:07:35,AspiringNoodle,And even I know who he is xD
03-08-2019T14:07:55,IronHorseComics,"I want Fortnight to crash and burn, Minecraft taking back the #1 spot is a step in the right direction"
03-08-2019T14:07:55,BadFoMo,I'm not a PvP persion.
03-08-2019T14:08:02,AspiringNoodle,I want Apex to thrive
03-08-2019T14:08:06,AspiringNoodle,That game is fuuuuuun
03-08-2019T14:08:14,AspiringNoodle,Can't play it atm tho
03-08-2019T14:08:18,AspiringNoodle,Stupid computer :c
03-08-2019T14:08:23,Mikemkke034,I'm with Iron. And BO4 Blackout is the battle royale for me
03-08-2019T14:10:45,TerraTheWizard,problem with apex is it already had it's time
03-08-2019T14:10:57,TerraTheWizard,the first couple of months it was out it was super popular
03-08-2019T14:11:04,TerraTheWizard,now no one talks about it
03-08-2019T14:13:11,TerraTheWizard,">Twitch is shite, Youtube is shite"
03-08-2019T14:13:41,TerraTheWizard,twitch varies wildly from community to community
03-08-2019T14:13:57,TerraTheWizard,and i've never been to a youtube stream that had a moderated chat
03-08-2019T14:15:52,IronHorseComics,youtube chat moves so dang fast
03-08-2019T14:17:09,Yevni,Guys
03-08-2019T14:17:09,Mikemkke034,Yes it does
03-08-2019T14:17:15,Yevni,Tonkatsu don or Udon
03-08-2019T14:18:56,Mikemkke034,Udon
03-08-2019T14:19:01,Mikemkke034,Tastes better
03-08-2019T14:21:04,Yevni,"I think my sniffles will agree. Udon it is. I donnu how the local place does there broth, but I do miss a good udon"
03-08-2019T14:24:05,Mikemkke034,We've got a place around where I live that has wonderful Udon
03-08-2019T14:27:04,Yevni,My hometown had this little family place that had the best broth with theirs. That's one of my favorite memories of the town honestly
03-08-2019T14:27:46,AspiringNoodle,Back from my video
03-08-2019T14:28:00,AspiringNoodle,"Part of the reason Apex ""had it's time"" is that it isn't putting out content at the same pace as Fortnite"
03-08-2019T14:28:13,AspiringNoodle,They made it very clear that they want to develop the game in such a way that is fair to the developers
03-08-2019T14:28:41,Mikemkke034,Oof
03-08-2019T14:28:48,AspiringNoodle,"Fortnite is putting out new content every 2 weeks or so, but people don't know or care about the human cost.  The overtime, the contractors."
03-08-2019T14:29:16,AspiringNoodle,"Let this sink in.  Fortnite developers are working so long and so hard, that they can end up taking home bonuses worth 2 - 3 times their normal pay."
03-08-2019T14:30:04,AspiringNoodle,"While it's fair to say that they're being well compensated, that level of sustained workload will burn people out in a matter of years, and then they're gone from the industry.  And that will just exacerbate the industry's inability to retain talent."
03-08-2019T14:30:36,Mikemkke034,Preach
03-08-2019T14:31:20,AspiringNoodle,"So, long story short, the AAA industry is heading for a bad time.  When the average career span for an industry is 5 (read that, FIVE) years, you're f*cked the moment mid - senior level staff are gone"
03-08-2019T14:34:23,AspiringNoodle,*checks email*
03-08-2019T14:34:27,AspiringNoodle,*sees fortnite email*
03-08-2019T14:34:31,AspiringNoodle,*opens fortnite email*

03-08-2019T14:35:34,AspiringNoodle,I'll be damned if Fortnite doesn't know how to push my buttons...
03-08-2019T14:35:51,AspiringNoodle,I still kinda regret not getting that first kitsune skin back in season 5 I think it was
03-08-2019T14:36:07,AspiringNoodle,"But my computer can barely run modern games at 1440p, so I didn't spend the money xD"

03-08-2019T14:43:35,Mikemkke034,"I myself would prefer tea, but to each their own"
03-08-2019T14:43:51,CrRAR,I have a very high regard for tea as well
03-08-2019T14:43:51,TeapotOfDoom,shivers

03-08-2019T14:45:28,CrRAR,"That reminds me, I've seen that coffee flavored syrup stuff at the supermarket so many times never really though to get it and put it on ice cream."
03-08-2019T14:45:36,Mikemkke034,Hmmm
03-08-2019T14:45:39,CrRAR,Coffee ice cream is probably better anyway tho.
03-08-2019T14:45:40,Mikemkke034,Maybe you should try it
03-08-2019T14:45:57,CrRAR,Get it and put it ON coffee ice cream
03-08-2019T14:46:03,CrRAR,:thinking:
03-08-2019T14:46:07,Mikemkke034,Yes!
03-08-2019T14:46:29,TeapotOfDoom,there is something called mancha ice cream
03-08-2019T14:46:44,Sclimshady,Mancha?
03-08-2019T14:46:54,TeapotOfDoom,it's some kind of tea i think
03-08-2019T14:47:03,Sclimshady,Matcha?
03-08-2019T14:47:05,TeapotOfDoom,it's amazing
03-08-2019T14:47:07,CrRAR,Green tea looks like
03-08-2019T14:47:16,TeapotOfDoom,yeah that could be it
03-08-2019T14:47:22,CrRAR,Sound like it'd be a very mellow flavor
03-08-2019T14:47:30,TeapotOfDoom,it is not

03-08-2019T17:04:18,Tharkis,now i can doodle stickfigures with a 120$ pencil  :ctharkis-uneasy:
03-08-2019T17:04:51,Tharkis,"i didnt get it for drawing though, but i bought the pencil anyways heh"
03-08-2019T17:04:53,TeapotOfDoom,is it good for doodling tho?
03-08-2019T17:05:07,MatyMaty,It is great for drawing in general
03-08-2019T17:05:08,Tharkis,"a lot of artists use it as their primary drawing surface now, Teapot"
03-08-2019T17:05:12,MatyMaty,yeah
03-08-2019T17:05:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"legit, stick figures are great for skeletoning Tharkis"
03-08-2019T17:05:33,TeapotOfDoom,how does it compare to a wacom?
03-08-2019T17:05:38,Tharkis,ipad pro + procreate = just as good as photoshop or CSP or SAI in hands that know the product
03-08-2019T17:05:48,TeapotOfDoom,tried a wacom a few weeks ago and it was mindblowing
03-08-2019T17:05:52,Tharkis,"honestly, just from my epxerience, it's got even less pencil lag than wacom"
03-08-2019T17:05:56,Tharkis,the one place it lacks
03-08-2019T17:05:58,Twokinds,Found another tablet pen
03-08-2019T17:06:00,Twokinds,This one seems to be working
03-08-2019T17:06:04,Tharkis,is the smooth shiny glass on the ipad
03-08-2019T17:06:08,TeapotOfDoom,all the pens
03-08-2019T17:06:09,CustomInk,Another pen
03-08-2019T17:06:14,Tharkis,makes drawing feel 'slick' and hard to hold a line
03-08-2019T17:06:23,CustomInk,Do you just have a pencil case full of Wacom Pens
03-08-2019T17:06:25,Zdziwionykot,and another one
03-08-2019T17:06:28,FloofyCat,I wonder how the pens even work.
03-08-2019T17:06:31,Tharkis,but there are people who sell matt / slightly textured stick on covers for the ipad to make it feel more like drawing on paper
03-08-2019T17:06:42,Twokinds,I have many wacom pens
03-08-2019T17:06:42,McClaw,"imagines these two ladies keeping a guy under the water ""to help""."

03-08-2019T17:07:00,Tharkis,"i had two wacom pens for my intuos, but one of them wandered off and i havent found it in 6 months =/"
03-08-2019T17:07:12,Tharkis,i only used the intuos for photo editing though never drawing

03-08-2019T17:07:48,CustomInk,I just fool around with IbisPaint X on my Samsung Galaxy Tab A and its default stylus
03-08-2019T17:07:51,Tharkis,it's in beta atm for iOS

03-08-2019T17:10:56,Twokinds,I think my drivers are messed up

03-08-2019T17:47:45,CrRAR,I rest my case
03-08-2019T17:47:46,InTheLionsDen,He was intoxicated with Natani's beautiful strength
03-08-2019T17:48:21,TeapotOfDoom,So resistance to deadly poison: yes
03-08-2019T17:48:36,TeapotOfDoom,Resistance to alcohol: No
03-08-2019T17:48:51,TeapotOfDoom,priorities
03-08-2019T17:49:10,FironMapleZ,resistance to something is always strange thing
03-08-2019T17:49:43,FironMapleZ,i mean there will always be a loophole
03-08-2019T17:53:09,AnuSekaniArt,Indeed
03-08-2019T17:53:32,FironMapleZ,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
03-08-2019T17:53:41,RimaDraws,is this the same sketch?
03-08-2019T17:53:45,CrRAR,yup
03-08-2019T17:53:46,FironMapleZ,ye
03-08-2019T17:53:54,RimaDraws,okie didnt know if i missed something
03-08-2019T17:53:57,CrRAR,Focusing on Kat rn
03-08-2019T17:54:05,CrRAR,The rest of layers are hidden
03-08-2019T17:54:14,CrRAR,very pretty tho
03-08-2019T17:54:40,AnuSekaniArt,Indeed ^^
03-08-2019T17:54:55,TeapotOfDoom,Am i mistaken or does tom take more time for each thing he does since he came back?
03-08-2019T17:55:12,FloofyCat,What do ya' mean?
03-08-2019T17:55:32,ProsePro7,He can take as much time as he wants on perfecting those thighs
03-08-2019T17:55:32,TeapotOfDoom,the color artwork from last week was next level. he really went all in on that one
03-08-2019T17:55:53,TeapotOfDoom,also the stream was 10 hous total i think
03-08-2019T17:56:05,TeapotOfDoom,which is longer then usual
03-08-2019T17:56:16,ProsePro7,Double usual
03-08-2019T17:56:26,FironMapleZ,oof
03-08-2019T17:57:19,TeapotOfDoom,i'm not complaining in the slightest ^^
03-08-2019T17:57:21,FloofyCat,Huh. I guess Tom is evolving and this is all Pokémon or something.
03-08-2019T17:57:35,FloofyCat,It's pretty great
03-08-2019T17:57:38,TeapotOfDoom,What is this? Tom is evolving?
03-08-2019T17:57:48,FloofyCat,Those backgrounds though
03-08-2019T17:57:57,TeapotOfDoom,They were amazing
03-08-2019T17:58:03,FironMapleZ,yo god damn right
03-08-2019T17:58:07,TeapotOfDoom,People on patreon noticed as well
03-08-2019T17:59:41,CrRAR,haha
03-08-2019T18:00:15,FloofyCat,Eventually we're gunna get some sort of suggestion for a landscape shot and Tom is going to go wild on it.
03-08-2019T18:00:28,TeapotOfDoom,that would be amazing
03-08-2019T18:00:37,TeapotOfDoom,by the power of all nora cards combined
03-08-2019T18:00:38,CrRAR,clipping
03-08-2019T18:00:42,AnuSekaniArt,"Indeed, Tom's gone above and beyond on the latest colored pics."
03-08-2019T18:00:43,FloofyCat,Although I feel like it'd be mean since it'd probably take like three hours to ink and colour.
03-08-2019T18:01:23,TeapotOfDoom,maybe if it's one big piece instead of a flood of smaller ones
03-08-2019T18:02:06,FloofyCat,Like some sort of double suggestion?
03-08-2019T18:02:36,TeapotOfDoom,like instead of a month color stream one huge panorama shot of the legacy estate with all the characters in super mega high res and huge
03-08-2019T18:03:32,TeapotOfDoom,somethig large enough to print on an entire wall. but then no color stuff for the month as compensation
03-08-2019T18:03:33,FironMapleZ,"core, hell yes"
03-08-2019T18:03:44,CrRAR,"Darn Kat, so indecisive today"
03-08-2019T18:04:14,FloofyCat,I dunno if it'd take up all five coloured slots
03-08-2019T18:04:37,TeapotOfDoom,depends on the size. the thing i'm imagining would
03-08-2019T18:05:15,Twokinds,aaah
03-08-2019T18:05:18,CrRAR,"Good thing Adira hasn't paid no mind, more jittery than a child... In the spa, outta the spa. WHAT IS IT?"
03-08-2019T18:05:19,LannAF,tom
03-08-2019T18:05:23,LannAF,check dragon chat
03-08-2019T18:05:24,TeapotOfDoom,a shot where you can see the entire estate but zoom in and have the characters with the level of detail
03-08-2019T18:05:27,FloofyCat,Poor Tom
03-08-2019T18:05:31,ProsePro7,Tom you got a case of artist block move on come back later
03-08-2019T18:05:43,IronHorseComics,you could have kat facing the other way
03-08-2019T18:05:46,BadFoMo,Dragon Chat?
03-08-2019T18:05:52,FloofyCat,^

03-08-2019T18:34:29,MviluUatusun,I guess Tom's through for the night.  Was he still having problems with his stylus?
03-08-2019T18:34:35,Bgrmystr2,Picarto didn't record Friday either. It's been broken.
03-08-2019T18:35:06,TerraTheWizard,"it did record friday, i watched it yesterday"
03-08-2019T18:35:48,TeapotOfDoom,i can't play it. seems pretty broken to me
03-08-2019T18:35:56,TerraTheWizard,"yeah, it's broken now"

03-08-2019T18:39:13,FenceEqualizer,Picarto breaking again?
03-08-2019T18:41:01,BadFoMo,Looks like it.
03-08-2019T18:41:02,SomeNiceUser,I’m here!
03-08-2019T18:41:12,SomeNiceUser,"Oh, I missed it."
03-08-2019T18:41:14,Dadrobit,"Hm, so my little brother is gonna have a kid. Just went over to our parents and gave them ""I'm going to be a Brandmother/father"" shirts."
03-08-2019T18:41:28,Dadrobit,Grandmother/father*
03-08-2019T18:41:42,FenceEqualizer,Was going to ask what a brandmother was
03-08-2019T18:41:48,SomeNiceUser,Same.
03-08-2019T18:41:53,thestooge2222,That's adorable!
03-08-2019T18:42:26,FenceEqualizer,But give your brother a random internet man's well wishes and congrats.
03-08-2019T18:42:54,SomeNiceUser,So what were the sketches for Tom’s stream?
03-08-2019T18:43:15,Dadrobit,I can sure as shit tell you what it's not lol.
03-08-2019T18:44:22,Combak,"Aww, did I miss the end of the stream?"
03-08-2019T18:44:34,Mazzis,It ended early
03-08-2019T18:44:42,Combak,"Oh, I see."
03-08-2019T18:44:54,Mazzis,Tom didn't feel well
03-08-2019T18:45:20,Dadrobit,"Tom's not feelin' it right now, plus his equipment was on the fritz."
03-08-2019T18:45:32,Combak,I see.
03-08-2019T18:47:13,SomeNiceUser,Ima just wait for the YouTube recordings.
03-08-2019T18:55:44,SomeNiceUser,"I’m looking at Wacom stuff right now, currently observing the One by Wacom."
03-08-2019T18:55:58,SomeNiceUser,Looks nice and affordable.
03-08-2019T18:58:13,SomeNiceUser,"60USD? Pretty good price, but is it up for the task?"
03-08-2019T19:01:30,Dadrobit,6inch by 3.7 inch active area. That's like drawing on an index card. Be prepared for your hands cramping up on that.
03-08-2019T19:04:33,FloofyCat,A lot of cheap tablets have a very small active tablet.
03-08-2019T19:04:48,FloofyCat,The Wacom Intous ones are usually big enough considering they sell for cheap on eBay
03-08-2019T19:06:51,Dadrobit,For $60 you could get a Huion or XP Pen with literally three times the active surface area.
03-08-2019T19:07:24,Dadrobit,https://www.amazon.com/10x6-25-Graphics-Battery-Free-Shortcut-Pressure/dp/B077P6BQP7/ref=sr_1_73?keywords=drawing+tablet&qid=1564963493&s=gateway&sr=8-73
03-08-2019T19:08:27,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"As much as I love my Huion, XP-pen is killing it right now."
03-08-2019T19:09:16,Dadrobit,":( Now that I have an hourly job again, I haven't had any time to draw anything."
03-08-2019T19:09:27,MarvTheHugPharaoh,;-;
03-08-2019T19:09:47,Dadrobit,Was looking into one of the new XP Pens though myself before I got my security gig back.
03-08-2019T19:11:22,SomeNiceUser,"I was thinking about a small tablet, but that tablet, damn that’s nice."
03-08-2019T19:12:05,SomeNiceUser,"I was gonna get a laptop, since I don’t have much space in my room."
03-08-2019T19:16:14,SomeNiceUser,"I got a solid shopping list now. Got the software, got the tablet and can’t forget the PC."
03-08-2019T19:16:40,SomeNiceUser,Now I have to wait for a sale on the PC.
03-08-2019T19:20:25,SomeNiceUser,Thank you for pointing out that tablet Robit.
03-08-2019T19:21:41,Dadrobit,No prob. Good luck.
03-08-2019T19:22:23,Dadrobit,Brad Colbow on YouTube has really solid reviews on a bunch of different tablets.
03-08-2019T19:22:51,MarvTheHugPharaoh,It was through his videos is how I picked out my tablet
03-08-2019T19:23:02,Dadrobit,Good source imo. He doesn't seem to overhype everything and isn't shy from pointing out flaws.
03-08-2019T19:23:25,SomeNiceUser,Noted. :ptv-victory:
03-08-2019T19:26:48,Dadrobit,"The XP Pen 15.6 Pro was what I was looking at. But without the time to invest on actually arting, I can't in good conscious spend money on anything, much less $400."
03-08-2019T19:28:52,Dadrobit,And my last sketchbook is almost totally full.
03-08-2019T19:29:33,SomeNiceUser,"Um, wow. That’s very impressive."
03-08-2019T19:30:46,Dadrobit,Was getting really into art when I could just work from home and had all the time in the world to throw down some lines.
03-08-2019T19:34:13,SomeNiceUser,"Art is lots of fun, if you put your heart to it!"
03-08-2019T19:37:07,SomeNiceUser,"For me, it’s a way to unwind and put my emotions onto paper.  But I want to try it out digitally."
03-08-2019T19:40:04,KiTA,"huh, stream over already?"
03-08-2019T19:40:18,InTheLionsDen,Tom wasn't feeling well.
03-08-2019T19:40:55,InTheLionsDen,Ended it early.
03-08-2019T19:40:55,KiTA,ah
03-08-2019T19:40:58,KiTA,XP Pen tablet huh.  Hm
03-08-2019T19:41:01,KiTA,I have a Monoprice
03-08-2019T19:43:18,SomeNiceUser,It sucks that all of the tablets so far are all right handed ones.
03-08-2019T19:48:51,Dadrobit,"A lot of them have a ""lefty"" software mode you can engage so that you can turn the tablet the other way around and it will recognize it."
03-08-2019T19:50:34,SomeNiceUser,That great!
03-08-2019T20:18:41,KiTA,Mine does yup
03-08-2019T20:18:51,KiTA,none of the buttons are labeled so it's easy enough tod o
03-08-2019T20:19:35,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-kingtea: hiya
03-08-2019T20:20:19,SomeNiceUser,Hello Ord! We were talking about tablet!
03-08-2019T20:22:07,Ordithus,Like slate tablet?  Commandment tablet?
03-08-2019T20:22:54,SomeNiceUser,:ptv-condescending: stone tablet...
03-08-2019T20:23:21,Ordithus,Nice.  Always wanted a nice chunk of granite.
03-08-2019T20:31:55,Mikemkke034,Hey mates
03-08-2019T20:32:08,SomeNiceUser,Hey Mike!
03-08-2019T20:32:18,Mikemkke034,How goes it?
03-08-2019T20:33:02,SomeNiceUser,"Pretty good, just playing with a 3DS since I was bored."
03-08-2019T20:33:11,Mikemkke034,Nice nice
03-08-2019T20:33:16,Mikemkke034,Xbox for me. Lmao
03-08-2019T20:34:42,SomeNiceUser,"I’ve got a Xbox as well, but I lent it to my parents because of some unknown issues with the 360"
03-08-2019T20:34:52,Mikemkke034,Ah
03-08-2019T20:35:14,Mikemkke034,"Caring, I see. Matches your name 😁"
03-08-2019T20:37:14,SomeNiceUser,"Yeah, thinking about changing it if I make a comic or something."
03-08-2019T20:37:32,SomeNiceUser,So it’s temporary.
03-08-2019T20:38:06,Mikemkke034,Nothing wrong with that. Any ideas on what you're wanting to do for a comic? Given that you do make one. Lol
03-08-2019T20:38:15,Mikemkke034,Do decide to*
03-08-2019T20:40:28,SomeNiceUser,"Something about a alternate world, maybe make something cute at first, but later drop a pretty heavy on the floor."
03-08-2019T20:41:19,Mikemkke034,Sounds quite intriguing
03-08-2019T20:42:17,SomeNiceUser,Kinda like a hidden side to a innocent being.
03-08-2019T20:42:36,Mikemkke034,Ah
03-08-2019T20:47:39,SomeNiceUser,"If I were to make it, I would love to make a joke version."
03-08-2019T20:51:49,SomeNiceUser,The idea started with a joke between me and a friend. “Let’s make a seemingly cute and harmless story! But let’s make it dark later.
03-08-2019T20:52:24,SomeNiceUser,And we just poured some ideas into it.
03-08-2019T20:52:32,Mikemkke034,"Well, I personally believe that joke would make a great storyline"
03-08-2019T20:54:03,TheOtherEric,Old streams just straight up wont load now 😭😭
03-08-2019T20:54:30,Mikemkke034,"Yeah, kinda sucks"
03-08-2019T20:54:50,SomeNiceUser,"You are right about that Mike, because just talking about the idea just sparked up a flame of inspiration."
03-08-2019T20:55:26,Mikemkke034,That's awesome to hear.
03-08-2019T20:56:27,Mikemkke034,"If you decide to work on it, I'd be glad to give feedback on progress"
03-08-2019T20:56:41,SomeNiceUser,But what to name the main character...
03-08-2019T20:57:01,Mikemkke034,Any idea what they look like?
03-08-2019T20:57:26,Mikemkke034,"That might help, as well as what the universe is going to consist of"
03-08-2019T20:58:54,SomeNiceUser,"It’s a fantasy world, but there was some technology that the world just discovered."
03-08-2019T20:59:21,Mikemkke034,And the main character was born into the fantasy?
03-08-2019T21:01:05,SomeNiceUser,"Well no, but actually, yes."
03-08-2019T21:01:43,Mikemkke034,"Male, Female, other, or undecided yet?"
03-08-2019T21:03:07,SomeNiceUser,Undecided.
03-08-2019T21:03:11,Mikemkke034,Okay
03-08-2019T21:04:04,SomeNiceUser,"But I can recycle my previous ideas too, there is a few names there."
03-08-2019T21:04:47,Mikemkke034,Alright. It's good to use any ideas that you have. New or not
03-08-2019T21:05:38,SomeNiceUser,"Aria, Elijah, Krine and Kalani."
03-08-2019T21:06:03,Mikemkke034,Kalani and Aria stand out to me
03-08-2019T21:06:28,Mikemkke034,And Kalani can be used for any character. Regardless of gender
03-08-2019T21:08:47,SomeNiceUser,Krine was my first choice in the scraped story. But Kalani does stand out.
03-08-2019T21:09:22,Mikemkke034,"Technically speaking, all of those names could be used as main/secondary characters"
03-08-2019T21:09:40,Mikemkke034,You don't necessarily need a singular main character
03-08-2019T21:10:21,SomeNiceUser,You are right about that.
03-08-2019T21:10:53,Mikemkke034,Just reminding you of that. Lol
03-08-2019T21:17:54,SomeNiceUser,"I can say that the main character has amnesia at the start, maybe overwritten memories."
03-08-2019T21:19:30,Mikemkke034,Maybe
03-08-2019T21:23:31,SomeNiceUser,"Made to serve as a servant for trivial tasks I guess... “Ya see, I need you to do the dishes because if I don’t, my wife will be chipping away at me.”"
03-08-2019T21:24:29,Mikemkke034,Lol
03-08-2019T21:35:21,SpazztasticKiwi,boo 👻
