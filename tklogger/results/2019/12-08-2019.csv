12-08-2019T00:00:22,Mikemkke034,Yeah. Working on loading the install onto my flash
12-08-2019T00:01:08,Mikemkke034,Is it bad that I currently have 2 laptops and my desktop all running and open on my desk at the same time?
12-08-2019T00:01:23,Mikemkke034,"And I'm ""somewhat"" using them all"
12-08-2019T00:09:18,AspiringNoodle,I wouldn't know
12-08-2019T00:09:29,AspiringNoodle,Is it bad that the thought of going in to work tomorrow for some reason gives me anxiety? xD
12-08-2019T00:10:58,Mikemkke034,I'm not too sure if it's bad or not
12-08-2019T00:21:19,Mikemkke034,"Well, I'm off to bed"
12-08-2019T00:21:21,Mikemkke034,Cheers mate
12-08-2019T00:21:31,AspiringNoodle,night
12-08-2019T00:26:34,AspiringNoodle,Anyone else have thoughts on my situation?
12-08-2019T01:09:35,AspiringNoodle,"Night, everyone :D"
12-08-2019T02:27:36,SpazztasticKiwi,ðŸ›Œ
12-08-2019T07:07:09,TeapotOfDoom,Good afternoon
12-08-2019T07:07:39,TeapotOfDoom,Or good morning usa
12-08-2019T07:08:08,TeapotOfDoom,I've got the feeling that it's gonna be a wonderful day
12-08-2019T07:31:19,Mikemkke034,It's 0831
12-08-2019T07:33:41,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-natsducky:
12-08-2019T07:36:46,Mikemkke034,aye Terra
12-08-2019T10:38:15,TeapotOfDoom,Quite a bit later in europe
12-08-2019T10:46:45,FreedomCrusader,was it a wonderful day?
12-08-2019T11:16:45,TeapotOfDoom,Went to prague so wasn't that bad.
12-08-2019T11:17:02,TeapotOfDoom,Now omw home after two weeks of vacation
12-08-2019T11:53:36,AspiringNoodle,When does Tom's color streams typically end?
12-08-2019T11:53:48,AspiringNoodle,...I cannot grammar today
12-08-2019T12:02:11,TerraTheWizard,they're usually 4.5-5 hours long
12-08-2019T12:02:27,TerraTheWizard,so maths for your timezone
12-08-2019T12:02:47,AspiringNoodle,"Okay, so east coast would be 1:30 - 2 at night"
12-08-2019T12:03:52,AspiringNoodle,I wish society wasn't so obsessed with early starts to the work day :/
12-08-2019T12:04:06,Sclimshady,Just do night shift
12-08-2019T12:05:22,AspiringNoodle,"I kinda am, lol"
12-08-2019T12:05:37,AspiringNoodle,But for some reason the new manager has decided to change the standard shift schedule and push everyone back 1 hour
12-08-2019T12:06:08,AspiringNoodle,I'm still salty that my shifts now end at 11 when I was told by the manager who did the interview that my shift is supposed to end at 10
12-08-2019T12:06:42,AspiringNoodle,I'm also the kind of person who likes getting things done shortly after waking up.
12-08-2019T12:09:24,AspiringNoodle,"So, everyone having a wonderful week so far? :D"
12-08-2019T12:12:12,Sclimshady,I haven't seen enough of it yet but it
12-08-2019T12:12:21,Sclimshady,It's alright
12-08-2019T12:12:45,Sclimshady,Apostrophe is too close to enter
12-08-2019T12:14:47,AspiringNoodle,*sigh* I hope my shift goes back to its 10 hour end time...
12-08-2019T12:14:58,AspiringNoodle,"it's what I was told, and 11 does feel too late, even with my sleep schedule"
12-08-2019T12:15:06,AspiringNoodle,10 o' clock*
12-08-2019T12:17:42,TeapotOfDoom,O/ sclim and noodle
12-08-2019T12:17:52,TeapotOfDoom,How was work / school?
12-08-2019T12:18:48,AspiringNoodle,Not bad
12-08-2019T12:18:57,AspiringNoodle,I'm just salty that the new guy comes in and changes everything up
12-08-2019T12:18:59,AspiringNoodle,lmao
12-08-2019T12:19:17,AspiringNoodle,"Interviewed by old manager, officially hired by new manager"
12-08-2019T12:19:24,AspiringNoodle,And now I have to deal with his new hours
12-08-2019T12:19:37,TeapotOfDoom,Ah explains the shift
12-08-2019T12:19:46,Sclimshady,"We just went over the syllabus and went home,  quite a drive for a piece of paper"
12-08-2019T12:20:05,TeapotOfDoom,Didn't even get to the welding
12-08-2019T12:20:08,TeapotOfDoom,?
12-08-2019T12:20:12,Sclimshady,Nope
12-08-2019T12:20:29,TeapotOfDoom,Uncool
12-08-2019T12:21:20,TeapotOfDoom,I teach people how to weld in like 15 min flat. I mean if you try to really master it there is some theory to be learned as well
12-08-2019T12:21:38,Sclimshady,Well everyone but me just got out of school a couple weeks ago so they were ok with it
12-08-2019T12:21:46,TeapotOfDoom,Well ok
12-08-2019T12:22:24,Sclimshady,We did intros and they all just graduated high school
12-08-2019T12:22:27,TeapotOfDoom,Still it's more fun and also demonstrative to just show it
12-08-2019T12:22:43,TeapotOfDoom,How long is the course?
12-08-2019T12:22:49,Sclimshady,18 weeks
12-08-2019T12:22:55,TeapotOfDoom,Wow
12-08-2019T12:23:15,TeapotOfDoom,You're really gonna go over pretty much anything there is
12-08-2019T12:23:52,Sclimshady,"Yeah, there are also 5 different courses involved in the certificate that are all 18 weeks"
12-08-2019T12:24:22,Sclimshady,But that includes pipe certification which is super involved
12-08-2019T12:24:22,TeapotOfDoom,That's prolly even wayyyy more advanced then i am...
12-08-2019T12:24:42,TeapotOfDoom,Ohh pipes are hard
12-08-2019T12:24:55,TeapotOfDoom,That came out wrong...
12-08-2019T12:25:36,Sclimshady,"This place is one of the best welding schools in the US.  one of our instructors ran the diablo canyon welding department,  also lol"
12-08-2019T12:26:22,TeapotOfDoom,Anything involving thin sheet metal is pretty mindblowing
12-08-2019T12:26:26,TeapotOfDoom,Wow nice
12-08-2019T12:26:45,TeapotOfDoom,Lemme guess. You're using Lincoln electric
12-08-2019T12:27:17,Sclimshady,The school has both but im a Lincoln fan
12-08-2019T12:27:33,TeapotOfDoom,What's the other brand?
12-08-2019T12:27:38,Sclimshady,Miller
12-08-2019T12:27:51,TeapotOfDoom,Ever tried a fronius?
12-08-2019T12:28:10,Sclimshady,That is something i have never heard of
12-08-2019T12:28:29,TeapotOfDoom,Hahaha i thought so
12-08-2019T12:29:00,Sclimshady,"Over here it's Lincoln, Miller, and Hobart for the budget friendly"
12-08-2019T12:29:04,TeapotOfDoom,Most advanced welding equipment you can get
12-08-2019T12:29:22,TeapotOfDoom,Licoln can't hold a candle to that stuff
12-08-2019T12:29:49,TeapotOfDoom,European company. Quite unusual to see in murica but some shops use it
12-08-2019T12:30:24,TeapotOfDoom,It tends to be expensive. In turn you can use it for generations to come
12-08-2019T12:30:49,Sclimshady,Im on their website. It looks pretty nifty
12-08-2019T12:31:01,TeapotOfDoom,Our workshop uses that stuff and i love it to bits
12-08-2019T12:31:36,TeapotOfDoom,Take a look at their magic wave wig/mig/electro combi
12-08-2019T12:31:53,Sclimshady,The big thing here is engine drive units because of all the rural jobsites
12-08-2019T12:32:53,TeapotOfDoom,Engine drive units? You mean the big block of metal in the engine core?
12-08-2019T12:33:49,Sclimshady,Its a giant welder with its own built in generator that can do every process except oxy welding
12-08-2019T12:34:15,Sclimshady,Fits in the bed of a truck so you can drive it anywhere
12-08-2019T12:34:20,TeapotOfDoom,Ohh wow
12-08-2019T12:35:00,TeapotOfDoom,Yeah logical step to make it self powered for that
12-08-2019T12:35:42,TeapotOfDoom,But never thought of that since europ is not that rural. Even the rural areas are not the american kind of rural
12-08-2019T12:36:18,Sclimshady,"They can run up to 40,000 for 100% duty cycle 27,000W diesel units"
12-08-2019T12:36:29,Sclimshady,so not cheap
12-08-2019T12:36:56,Sclimshady,"but some are only $5,000"
12-08-2019T12:37:21,TeapotOfDoom,I can imagine... i mean fronius has a battery powered welder... but that thing prolly has way less power
12-08-2019T12:38:03,TeapotOfDoom,We have it but i haven't had the need to use it yat
12-08-2019T12:38:07,TeapotOfDoom,*yet
12-08-2019T12:39:01,Sclimshady,The engine ones are designed for pipelines and railroads and such that wont leave the field for months at a time
12-08-2019T12:39:48,TeapotOfDoom,I mean i play around with welding equip but i'm not that profecional with that stuff. I'm still an it guy
12-08-2019T12:40:17,TeapotOfDoom,Welding rails? Wow that thing has to have punch
12-08-2019T12:41:13,Sclimshady,"If you can kinda weld you are pretty much set for life, yeah thats prrobably why its $40,000"
12-08-2019T12:43:14,TeapotOfDoom,Ya know titans of cnc? Friend of mine is a big fan
12-08-2019T12:44:09,Sclimshady,"I don't,  but machining would be something I would love to learn"
12-08-2019T12:45:04,AspiringNoodle,"You guys make it sound like I should learn to weld, then worry about art stuff, lol"
12-08-2019T12:45:07,TeapotOfDoom,Also 40k? What the hell??? I mean i dunno what is considered kinda cause i can kinda put metal together and depending on the difficulty of the part i manage to make it look nice but i'm far from pro
12-08-2019T12:45:47,TeapotOfDoom,I can feed you resources if you want sclim
12-08-2019T12:45:50,Sclimshady,"Those expensive ones will last 100 years, but they can do anything"
12-08-2019T12:47:41,Sclimshady,Some even have turbocharged engines
12-08-2019T12:51:19,TeapotOfDoom,"Haha noodle if you get the chance to learn it, try it. It's a great skill to have in any case. But i would not choose it over art"
12-08-2019T12:51:46,AspiringNoodle,"Well, I need to do SOMETHING to earn a living / make monehs while practicing ;_;"
12-08-2019T12:51:58,NibblyBot,New Patreon Post: Weapon Training https://www.patreon.com/posts/weapon-training-29138853
12-08-2019T12:52:26,TeapotOfDoom,I mean i know artists who have specialised in welding sculptures but those are kinda hard to share online
12-08-2019T12:52:28,AspiringNoodle,"""Stabby stabby. DIE. DIE. DIE."""
12-08-2019T12:52:58,TeapotOfDoom,screams for help and hops away
12-08-2019T12:53:04,Sclimshady,You need to make journeyman before you start making real money so unless it's what you want to do its not a good temp job
12-08-2019T12:53:24,AspiringNoodle,At least I got the gas station :D
12-08-2019T12:53:30,TeapotOfDoom,What is journeyman?
12-08-2019T12:53:43,TeapotOfDoom,Good starting off point
12-08-2019T12:53:51,AspiringNoodle,"Seriously though, once I've settled in, I should look into brushing up my coding skills and see about getting a programming job..."
12-08-2019T12:54:07,Sclimshady,It means you can take a job without being supervised by a senior welder
12-08-2019T12:54:25,AspiringNoodle,"Earn way more money, have a normal ""9 - 5"", and not really have to worry while practicing"
12-08-2019T12:54:28,TeapotOfDoom,Ah get it. Certificate kinda thing right?
12-08-2019T12:54:47,Sclimshady,Its more a union term
12-08-2019T12:55:14,TeapotOfDoom,Ah yes you guys over there are less regulated in a nation kinda way
12-08-2019T12:55:16,Sclimshady,Certificate lets you work easier
12-08-2019T12:56:13,Sclimshady,A master could technically certify you from job expirience

12-08-2019T12:57:07,TeapotOfDoom,Yes we have something here that's kinda that but it's a state given certificate
12-08-2019T12:57:15,TeapotOfDoom,If dou can call it that
12-08-2019T12:57:32,TeapotOfDoom,Also my turn to drive so be back in about an hour
12-08-2019T12:57:37,TeapotOfDoom,Bye
12-08-2019T12:57:46,Sclimshady,Yay for driving
12-08-2019T12:58:03,TeapotOfDoom,Woohoo
12-08-2019T12:59:09,FreedomCrusader,bye teapot
12-08-2019T13:04:21,AspiringNoodle,Have a nice drive
12-08-2019T13:04:35,AspiringNoodle,"Man, my weight is all over the place, lol"
12-08-2019T13:04:43,AspiringNoodle,I hope this time it'll stay down and keep going down
12-08-2019T13:09:13,AspiringNoodle,291 -> 297 -> 289 :D
12-08-2019T13:10:24,FreedomCrusader,I assume that is pounds and not kilograms
12-08-2019T13:11:09,AspiringNoodle,Yes
12-08-2019T13:11:18,AspiringNoodle,"jesus, if that was kg..."
12-08-2019T13:11:33,FreedomCrusader,"well, there are people that does have that in kg"
12-08-2019T13:15:03,AspiringNoodle,"But yeah, no, lbs"
12-08-2019T13:15:24,AspiringNoodle,I'm hoping that this job at Turkey Hill will help curb my weight and eventually influence my eating habits
12-08-2019T13:15:58,AspiringNoodle,"While we don't get meal breaks (even on an 8 hour shift), I was working so much that I only got hungry ~2 - 3 hours in because I was constantly smelling food"
12-08-2019T13:16:12,AspiringNoodle,"But after that, nothing xD"
12-08-2019T13:16:27,FreedomCrusader,You work 8 hours without any breaks?
12-08-2019T13:16:34,FreedomCrusader,or jsut no long enough breaks for food?
12-08-2019T13:17:32,Sclimshady,Is that legal?
12-08-2019T13:18:06,FreedomCrusader,sounds harsh to work for 8 hours like that
12-08-2019T13:18:32,CrimsonQuill,Evening all
12-08-2019T13:18:37,CrimsonQuill,:ptv-greetings::ptv-greetings::ptv-greetings:
12-08-2019T13:18:45,Sclimshady,Hi Quill o/
12-08-2019T13:18:46,AspiringNoodle,"You can get a meal break, but they have to be individually approved by a manager"
12-08-2019T13:19:01,AspiringNoodle,the only legit breaks that are available are smoke breaks for smokers xD
12-08-2019T13:19:10,AspiringNoodle,Also hi Quill :D
12-08-2019T13:19:29,FreedomCrusader,Evening quill
12-08-2019T13:19:42,AspiringNoodle,I won't know how I feel about the no breaks thing until I work for a bit
12-08-2019T13:20:12,AspiringNoodle,And today promises to be busier than Sunday
12-08-2019T13:20:17,CrimsonQuill,Finally published my first OC Reference sheet
12-08-2019T13:20:24,CrimsonQuill,And I'm really proud of it.
12-08-2019T13:20:41,CrimsonQuill,Busy at work Noodle?
12-08-2019T13:22:17,AspiringNoodle,Not for another 35 minutes
12-08-2019T13:22:51,AspiringNoodle,"I've said it before, I'll say it again.  I hope that eventually the new manager moves everything back to where it was.  Because he decided to shift all shifts back an hour"
12-08-2019T13:23:21,FreedomCrusader,any particular reason or did he just announce it without an explanation?
12-08-2019T13:23:32,CrimsonQuill,Sounds rought...
12-08-2019T13:23:33,AspiringNoodle,He literally just took over for the old manager last week
12-08-2019T13:23:56,AspiringNoodle,"And for who knows why decided that the 6 - 2, 2 - 10, 10 - 6 shift blocks don't make sense"
12-08-2019T13:24:14,AspiringNoodle,"So now they need to be 7 - 3, 3 - 11, 11 - 7"
12-08-2019T13:24:30,AspiringNoodle,"If that isn't a reason to quit, I don't know what is"
12-08-2019T13:24:54,FreedomCrusader,I work from 7-3
12-08-2019T13:25:07,AspiringNoodle,What kind of job?
12-08-2019T13:25:13,FreedomCrusader,Electrician
12-08-2019T13:25:22,CrimsonQuill,Nice.
12-08-2019T13:25:44,FreedomCrusader,Currently doing installations on a new sewage treatment plant
12-08-2019T13:26:02,FreedomCrusader,"brand new luckily so there's no ""water"" there yet"
12-08-2019T13:26:06,AspiringNoodle,I hope at some point in the future be able to snag a job where I can work 9 - 5 or 10 - 6 xD
12-08-2019T13:27:29,FreedomCrusader,"I wouldn't mind that schedule, it's harsh being up at 6am when all my most active friends are online from 9-12pm"
12-08-2019T13:28:06,AspiringNoodle,"In 20 years or so, things might finally change"
12-08-2019T13:28:21,AspiringNoodle,We're still stuck in stupidly archaic / obselete work models
12-08-2019T13:33:54,CrimsonQuill,"Schedules are all over the place in places of work, it seems."
12-08-2019T13:34:41,Sclimshady,I work 6-1430
12-08-2019T13:35:39,AspiringNoodle,Part of it is unavoidable
12-08-2019T13:35:58,AspiringNoodle,Things like critical infrastructure and public servants need to be available 24/7
12-08-2019T13:36:38,AspiringNoodle,"And ideally, people who prefer being awake at night as opposed to daytime would take up those positions"
12-08-2019T13:37:42,AspiringNoodle,and it really sucks when the super majority of society is awake at some time between 6 - 12
12-08-2019T13:38:05,FreedomCrusader,"I prefer being awake at night, to be on my computer"
12-08-2019T13:38:06,AspiringNoodle,"As for the rest... the morning people are douches, lol"
12-08-2019T13:38:20,AspiringNoodle,"""I wake up early, therefore everyone needs to go to work at the same time as me"""
12-08-2019T13:39:01,AspiringNoodle,"Before I forget, there are also some industries where it's beneficial to wake up early.  Like construction.  Early enough to see, but not so late as to bake in the sun"
12-08-2019T13:39:26,FreedomCrusader,we don't really have the bake in the sun problem in Norway
12-08-2019T13:39:32,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-nibrun:
12-08-2019T13:39:44,FreedomCrusader,and it's generally light most of the time aswell
12-08-2019T13:39:45,CrimsonQuill,:ptv-greetings::ptv-greetings::ptv-greetings: Hi there Terra
12-08-2019T13:39:48,FreedomCrusader,hi terra
12-08-2019T13:39:49,TerraTheWizard,hey
12-08-2019T13:39:50,Sclimshady,Its 105 here so we very much have that problem
12-08-2019T13:39:55,AspiringNoodle,"But for other businesses, like bakeries, coffee shops, etc, they wake up early so they can be ready for morning commuters who wake up and start commuting before 7 :/"
12-08-2019T13:39:57,Sclimshady,Hi Terra
12-08-2019T13:40:05,AspiringNoodle,Hello Terra and endless Nibbly's

12-08-2019T13:40:11,TerraTheWizard,"so i've got a job interview tomorrow, went to look at their website as research"
12-08-2019T13:40:22,FreedomCrusader,for what job?
12-08-2019T13:40:23,AspiringNoodle,Mistakes were made?
12-08-2019T13:40:24,TerraTheWizard,and the site looks like it was designed in 2000
12-08-2019T13:40:30,AspiringNoodle,Mistakes were made. lol
12-08-2019T13:40:38,FreedomCrusader,there's alot of that around
12-08-2019T13:40:42,TerraTheWizard,apprentice payroll clerk
12-08-2019T13:40:46,FreedomCrusader,and it's always frustrating to come across
12-08-2019T13:50:33,AspiringNoodle,"Yay, time for work :ptv-unimpressed:"

12-08-2019T16:12:51,TeapotOfDoom,Finally home
12-08-2019T16:12:58,TeapotOfDoom,Everythings in place
12-08-2019T16:13:07,Sclimshady,Welcome home
12-08-2019T16:13:14,TeapotOfDoom,Thanks ^^
12-08-2019T16:14:28,Sclimshady,"Somehow my english class turned into a political argument, why?"
12-08-2019T16:16:06,TeapotOfDoom,Lol
12-08-2019T16:16:44,TeapotOfDoom,Typical red v blue?
12-08-2019T16:17:46,TeapotOfDoom,In the audio book we listened to on the way home there's a guy calleb Bihari. Close enough...
12-08-2019T16:18:19,Sclimshady,There is no need for our first assignment to be our opinions on some pretty radical political cartoons.  One section is literally wether we agree with the anti liberal or anti conservative comic more
12-08-2019T16:21:11,CrimsonQuill,Oh dear.
12-08-2019T16:21:21,CrimsonQuill,That's bound to raise a few hackles.
12-08-2019T16:23:13,TeapotOfDoom,Agreed
12-08-2019T16:23:45,TeapotOfDoom,Especially in a charged political atmosphere like the one now
12-08-2019T16:24:02,TeapotOfDoom,Also o/ Quill
12-08-2019T16:27:01,CrimsonQuill,'Ullo Teapot

12-08-2019T16:29:46,Mikemkke034,Hey all :p
12-08-2019T16:30:02,CrimsonQuill,Hullo
12-08-2019T16:30:10,Mikemkke034,How're you?
12-08-2019T16:30:11,Sclimshady,Hi Mike o/
12-08-2019T16:30:19,CrimsonQuill,Fine thanks
12-08-2019T16:30:25,Mikemkke034,Sclim o/ !
12-08-2019T16:30:37,Mikemkke034,And no problem :yum:
12-08-2019T16:31:09,Mikemkke034,I finally got my desktop up and running
12-08-2019T16:31:36,Sclimshady,Yay \o/ mobile is cancer
12-08-2019T16:31:49,Mikemkke034,"Yeah. I have been using my laptop, but that sucks too"
12-08-2019T16:39:42,TeapotOfDoom,Did you have to reinstall the system?
12-08-2019T16:40:03,TeapotOfDoom,Haha nice quill ^^
12-08-2019T16:43:51,Mikemkke034,Yeah Teapot
12-08-2019T16:43:57,Mikemkke034,I did :(
12-08-2019T16:59:29,CrimsonQuill,Goodnight all
12-08-2019T17:04:49,TerraTheWizard,o/

12-08-2019T17:09:47,TeapotOfDoom,I'm gonna call it too. Night y'all!
12-08-2019T17:11:23,Sclimshady,Night Teapot
12-08-2019T17:39:06,Mikemkke034,Night mate
12-08-2019T17:50:11,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
12-08-2019T17:54:36,Dadrobit,"Ah, seems I missed a conversation about welding. But to add my $0.02, yes, learning to weld proficiently is unbelievably lucrative. Pops used to teach welding at the high school level and made sure he got as many of his students as many certificates as"
12-08-2019T17:55:25,Dadrobit,possible before they graduated. Kids left high school after taking his courses and went on to immediately get $40+ an hour jobs.
12-08-2019T17:56:37,Dadrobit,Now he teaches welding at the college level and he's working on coursework to teach students how to use automated welding machines so they can go out and get the jobs that robots replaced as well.
12-08-2019T17:57:04,Sclimshady,"It's a pretty high demand field.  Since I haven't seen you since, congrats on your rollarcoaster pic"
12-08-2019T17:57:13,Dadrobit,\o/ Thanks
12-08-2019T17:57:26,Sclimshady,:roller_coaster:
12-08-2019T17:59:55,Dadrobit,"Yeah, he used to organize and participate in inter-state welding competitions for his students. They always got high marks in the end and a lot of his kids got jobs from being talent spotted at the events. If those kids followed through, they were set."
12-08-2019T18:01:39,Sclimshady,Plus if you do pipe or marine welding you can see 6 figures starting out
12-08-2019T18:03:27,Dadrobit,"Yeah, last event he got an underwater welding company to come out with a giant tank and give demos on what goes on in the field."
12-08-2019T18:04:47,Sclimshady,Thats really cool
12-08-2019T18:04:53,Dadrobit,And the kids have a blast because every event is themed. Last one he did was Mad Max themed and the kids had two days to fabricate a working Mad Max go kart pretty much from scratch in their parking lot.
12-08-2019T18:05:20,Dadrobit,Example A: https://i.imgur.com/WpdNIpw.jpg
12-08-2019T18:07:04,Sclimshady,Thats awesome!  we mostly do trailers at our school seeing as its a structural certificate course
12-08-2019T18:10:14,Dadrobit,"Hehehe, part of the competition judging was on structural soundness I suppose. The karts had to go through obstacle courses and survive rough terrain. Some were pretty good at installing proper suspension and making sure everything was tight."
12-08-2019T18:10:24,Dadrobit,Others however.... https://i.imgur.com/HxjY8IY.jpg
12-08-2019T18:11:54,Dadrobit,And of course we had some serious professionals show up as well https://i.imgur.com/CnbRGyN.jpg
12-08-2019T18:14:55,Sclimshady,That looks pretty fun.
12-08-2019T18:16:28,Dadrobit,"Alas, he retired from high school. But he's trying to get the event to be a permanent fixture of his college so they have a central location every year instead of having it shift all around the states with varying levels of quality."
12-08-2019T18:17:24,Dadrobit,The ones that he doesn't host are very hit or miss. The one prior to this almost killed the program entirely because the school hosting it put zero fucking effort into it.
12-08-2019T18:18:17,Sclimshady,Events like that are great when you do them on site.  Our welding contest attracts businesses looking to hire right out of the course
12-08-2019T18:20:08,Mikemkke034,Hmm
12-08-2019T18:24:21,Dadrobit,"Be back in a bit, heading to the store."
12-08-2019T18:28:59,Mikemkke034,Alright

12-08-2019T18:38:29,Mikemkke034,Aye o/
12-08-2019T18:39:02,IronHorseComics,eeeeeeeeeyyyyyyyyyyyyy
12-08-2019T18:40:28,Sclimshady,Someone told the electrician he could shut off the power while I was doing school work and I lost it all
12-08-2019T18:40:55,IronHorseComics,ouch
12-08-2019T18:41:05,Mikemkke034,Damn...

12-08-2019T18:44:34,CrRAR,"Ello schlim, also condolences.:pray:"
12-08-2019T18:45:04,CrRAR,No chance of autorecover? Was it in Office?
12-08-2019T18:45:27,Mikemkke034,Hey Cr
12-08-2019T18:45:43,Sclimshady,Its in a program on the website with no manual save options either
12-08-2019T18:45:56,Sclimshady,on the school website
12-08-2019T18:46:09,IronHorseComics,sounds like the old story writing things Deviantart used to have
12-08-2019T18:46:20,Mikemkke034,Yeah
12-08-2019T18:47:09,IronHorseComics,you couldn't save it and if you happen to click the wrong button well too bad. Plus you had to manually code in italics or bolds or the like and losing this really long story really stings
12-08-2019T18:48:37,Sclimshady,Luckily it was like 2 paragraphs
12-08-2019T18:48:52,IronHorseComics,you're fortunate
12-08-2019T18:48:57,IronHorseComics,still that really sucks
12-08-2019T18:49:04,Mikemkke034,That is lucky
12-08-2019T18:58:15,IronHorseComics,"hmmm, after a very hot day, the storm rolls in, meaning tomorrow is going to be absolutely dreadful"
12-08-2019T19:10:24,Mikemkke034,Humid as hell mate
12-08-2019T19:10:35,Mikemkke034,That's for sure
12-08-2019T19:10:45,IronHorseComics,makes me glad I work indoors
12-08-2019T19:10:52,IronHorseComics,with air conditioning
12-08-2019T19:10:56,Mikemkke034,Lol
12-08-2019T19:11:06,Mikemkke034,I work in and outdoors
12-08-2019T19:11:17,Mikemkke034,Though I'm also in school (With AC)
12-08-2019T19:16:11,SpazztasticKiwi,"legend says if you close a door when your cat is in another area of the house, he will know and come find you to open it"
12-08-2019T19:17:06,SpazztasticKiwi,and then watch
12-08-2019T19:19:03,IronHorseComics,and then laugh as his pointless task was accomplished
12-08-2019T19:26:04,Mikemkke034,Lmfao
12-08-2019T19:26:15,Mikemkke034,Quite amusing to come back to hose messages
12-08-2019T21:03:59,SpazztasticKiwi,no wonder cats repel creepers - theyâ€™ll race through the whole house just to stare at you from an open doorway
12-08-2019T21:24:57,RimaDraws,hey
12-08-2019T21:41:34,Mikemkke034,Aye
12-08-2019T22:17:46,AspiringNoodle,I am back from work

12-08-2019T22:21:26,AspiringNoodle,And then he let me know that call I got a few days ago was him talking with someone from ANOTHER business and potentially getting me a trial
12-08-2019T22:22:30,AspiringNoodle,Small brain: more hours if fulltime?
12-08-2019T22:23:01,AspiringNoodle,"Big brain: Consistent mon - fri, starting in the morning end in the afternoon, weekends free, more conducive to artings?"
12-08-2019T22:59:08,AspiringNoodle,...I kinda like working at turkey hill
