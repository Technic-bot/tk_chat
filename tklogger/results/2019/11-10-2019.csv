11-10-2019T00:04:39,DarthRexKing,You must have been pissed.
11-10-2019T00:04:42,Ordithus,"Sage, that pic was nice!"
11-10-2019T00:04:42,RimaDraws,that would scare me
11-10-2019T00:05:06,RimaDraws,if someone removes my teeth i need them to knock me out. or i wont do it
11-10-2019T00:05:12,DarthRexKing,Yeah.
11-10-2019T00:05:13,Ordithus,"Had that once when I had a filling - with the drill.  Double dose on one side, none on the side they were drilling"
11-10-2019T00:05:15,Ordithus,Tickled
11-10-2019T00:05:29,DarthRexKing,Tis but a scratch!
11-10-2019T00:05:32,RimaDraws,ive gone through with no numbing meds before on a filling
11-10-2019T00:05:40,RimaDraws,was the best thing ever! (sarcasm)
11-10-2019T00:05:52,Ordithus,also when I had surgery to remove my appendix is when I learned morphine does nothing
11-10-2019T00:05:56,RimaDraws,no but seriously it was no fun

11-10-2019T00:07:49,Ordithus,I remember less burning in the original of this
11-10-2019T00:07:59,RimaDraws,it was sarcasm darth
11-10-2019T00:07:59,SageSaga,"""Congrats! You dont have cancer!"""
11-10-2019T00:08:05,RimaDraws,read the parentheses
11-10-2019T00:08:41,DarthRexKing,"I missed it, and that must have sucked, Ord."
11-10-2019T00:09:09,Ordithus,It wasn't actually all that bad.  The pain after surgery was nothing compared to before
11-10-2019T00:09:19,DarthRexKing,"Who doesn't have cancer, Sage?"
11-10-2019T00:09:29,DarthRexKing,"Good to know, Ord."
11-10-2019T00:09:36,RimaDraws,i never had bad pain after my wisdom teeth were removed
11-10-2019T00:09:45,SageSaga,was saying thats a good Medical situation
11-10-2019T00:10:24,DarthRexKing,Ah. Reminds me when I had my in grown toenails removed. Had cold to numb them and watched my toes cut open to remove them. It was interesting. :)
11-10-2019T00:10:36,RimaDraws,yea i remember having that done darth
11-10-2019T00:10:46,RimaDraws,lot of pressure but it was interesting
11-10-2019T00:11:15,RimaDraws,felt better afterward
11-10-2019T00:11:34,DarthRexKing,Obviously? Ingrown toenails don't feel good.
11-10-2019T00:11:48,RimaDraws,they gave me a shot in my foot for the numbing
11-10-2019T00:11:55,BadFoMo,"@Ordithus Tom decided, for the 25th anavercery, to go back an CGI in all the things he wanted in the comic but couldn't do/aford and fix some things."

11-10-2019T00:27:04,DarthRexKing,With me where?
11-10-2019T00:27:17,AspiringNoodle,I'm guessing you aren't staying up to watch strem? :P
11-10-2019T00:27:32,SageSaga,yeah but there's no set value of Sleep- so for anyone with a lower value of sleep it comes across as rude to say the stream isnt worth any time
11-10-2019T00:27:49,DarthRexKing,Wait what?
11-10-2019T00:28:16,AspiringNoodle,My brain can't even today right now
11-10-2019T00:28:34,SageSaga,"you said ""Not wasting sleep on this stream"" which means ""Im not wasting time on this stream"""
11-10-2019T00:29:17,DarthRexKing,"Yeah, because I am going to bed. I'll catch you all later."
11-10-2019T00:29:27,DarthRexKing,Night and thanks for stream. :)
11-10-2019T00:30:00,DarthRexKing,"Also what did you mean you were with me, Noodle?"
11-10-2019T00:30:25,SageSaga,Noodle was also saying our stream wasnt good enough to give up some sleep for!
11-10-2019T00:30:43,CrimsonHelsing,wha- how dare they! xD
11-10-2019T00:31:11,SageSaga,its not what that meant it's how they say it XD
11-10-2019T00:31:34,DarthRexKing,??? I am lost now.
11-10-2019T00:31:50,SageSaga,"its like - ""Goodnight my friends!"" vs ""Goodnight losers!"""
11-10-2019T00:32:29,DarthRexKing,I think there was a misunderstanding here. .w. But you all take care.

11-10-2019T00:37:14,ZRO4825,"Not Kaylin's type as you'll recall, boys don't do it for her~"
11-10-2019T00:37:19,BadFoMo,They weren't?

11-10-2019T02:33:49,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Can they get in contact with local police?
11-10-2019T02:34:33,MarvTheHugPharaoh,or any one who works for the prefecture
11-10-2019T02:35:04,SageSaga,they contacted the Foreigner help line but the person didnt speak enough english to help
11-10-2019T02:38:09,sunblaze,damn that sounds serious then.
11-10-2019T02:39:37,SageSaga,i retweeted it - hope they get help
11-10-2019T02:54:57,SageSaga,sorry im a bit distracted trying to make sure they are ok

11-10-2019T02:57:23,MatyMaty,oh no :(
11-10-2019T03:00:22,SageSaga,one of them has a rare illness too so she can get in bad shape really fast
11-10-2019T03:02:06,MatyMaty,I hope they will be okay :(
11-10-2019T03:03:43,SageSaga,I contacted a Monster Hunter youtuber who lives in Japan- he's posting mirror sites for evacuation instructions for people now
11-10-2019T03:04:03,SageSaga,because the normal sites are crashing from traffic
11-10-2019T03:04:17,MatyMaty,geez
11-10-2019T03:08:04,SageSaga,soooo
11-10-2019T03:08:08,SageSaga,how are you?
11-10-2019T03:08:41,MatyMaty,"eeeh, good but not really? Or bad, but I guess good? XP"
11-10-2019T03:08:58,SageSaga,what's wrong?
11-10-2019T03:09:38,MatyMaty,"ah well, a close relative had a really bad health scare and was in the hospital for a while, but they are out of danger now."
11-10-2019T03:10:06,SageSaga,glad to hear they are out of danger
11-10-2019T03:10:20,MatyMaty,and I had to take care for that for the most part. Which led to another thing
11-10-2019T03:11:11,MatyMaty,"Remember I was gonna get a new comp and tablet from my relatives who own the restaurant, for all the help I've given (and I guess to get me to not quit)?"
11-10-2019T03:11:36,SageSaga,ah- well this means thats not going to happen now right?
11-10-2019T03:11:57,MatyMaty,"My plan was to get the best PC I could afford and the cheapest cintiq, a 13 HD or that new 16"
11-10-2019T03:12:33,MatyMaty,"well, they thought that since I was under so much stress they would buy me the stuff by surprise."
11-10-2019T03:12:51,MatyMaty,"But they don't know anything about comps, and more so they went to BestBuy..."
11-10-2019T03:13:07,SageSaga,oof
11-10-2019T03:13:14,MatyMaty,yeaaah
11-10-2019T03:13:40,SageSaga,best buy return policy?
11-10-2019T03:14:04,MatyMaty,"so instead of the PC I was gonna build myself, they got a Lenovo gaming laptop"
11-10-2019T03:14:32,MatyMaty,"and instead of the cheap cintiq, they got the 16 inch mobile studio pro"
11-10-2019T03:14:43,SageSaga,o_O
11-10-2019T03:14:49,MatyMaty,I know!
11-10-2019T03:15:33,SageSaga,that's a chunk of money-
11-10-2019T03:15:56,SageSaga,im curious what kinda Lenovo they got
11-10-2019T03:15:58,MatyMaty,I know. The laptop is the 17 inch Y730
11-10-2019T03:17:07,MatyMaty,"which I've read is like, just okay?"
11-10-2019T03:17:37,SageSaga,if these specs are right- its a bit behind current but by no means bad-
11-10-2019T03:17:42,MatyMaty,yeah
11-10-2019T03:17:42,Mihari,Depends on the graphics card
11-10-2019T03:17:49,SageSaga,1050ti
11-10-2019T03:18:03,MatyMaty,but is not the2070 super I wanted ;_;
11-10-2019T03:18:28,SageSaga,yeah but if you returned those both you could get that PC still and get a tablet-
11-10-2019T03:18:49,MatyMaty,I am wondering if I should XO I don't want to hurt their feelings
11-10-2019T03:18:56,MatyMaty,or have them change their mind
11-10-2019T03:19:27,MatyMaty,is funny that the Mobile Studio pro is an i7 computer on its own
11-10-2019T03:19:29,sunblaze,just tell that them thanks for the effort but what I needed were a few specifi things that those don't have so its better that you choose yourself
11-10-2019T03:19:34,MatyMaty,it comes with windows 10 and all
11-10-2019T03:19:41,MatyMaty,and Candy Crush for some reason
11-10-2019T03:19:49,SageSaga,thats just a windows 10 thing
11-10-2019T03:20:12,sunblaze,indeed CC was one of the first things I deinstalled on win 10 :D
11-10-2019T03:20:35,SageSaga,they did surprisingly well for what they tried to do though
11-10-2019T03:20:56,MatyMaty,"I mean, the mobile studio is all kinds of insane"
11-10-2019T03:20:59,SageSaga,the Mobile studio 16 is no slouch- its a 4k screen for one thing
11-10-2019T03:21:14,MatyMaty,is like the top of the line wacom thing alongside the 32 inch cintiq
11-10-2019T03:21:22,sunblaze,"perhaps but they renamed a lot of sub-menues its a hazard to find something you are ""used to know"" where it was"
11-10-2019T03:21:23,SageSaga,its terrible for games-
11-10-2019T03:21:50,MatyMaty,is the 1050 Ti any good?
11-10-2019T03:21:53,SageSaga,man that gaming laptop even has thunderbolt XD
11-10-2019T03:22:04,Mihari,If it has Thunderbolt...
11-10-2019T03:22:12,MatyMaty,is that good?
11-10-2019T03:22:15,Mihari,You could get a graphics card expansion enclosure.
11-10-2019T03:22:24,SageSaga,what i looked up said it had thunderbolt- but Maty will need to confirm
11-10-2019T03:22:34,MatyMaty,lesseee
11-10-2019T03:22:48,MatyMaty,Thunderbolt 3
11-10-2019T03:23:15,SageSaga,thunderbolt is super fast - so much that its able to be used to connect a graphics card up to it via thunderbolt and give massive boosts
11-10-2019T03:23:22,MatyMaty,mmmmh!
11-10-2019T03:23:33,MatyMaty,then might be worth keeping it?
11-10-2019T03:23:58,SageSaga,i dunno because you would still need to buy a graphics card and thunderbolt enclosure
11-10-2019T03:24:10,SageSaga,for top tier gaming
11-10-2019T03:24:38,SageSaga,but i still think a desktop would be better
11-10-2019T03:24:52,MatyMaty,I was mostly thinking for 3D rendering/modeling XD I'm a scrub when it comes to gaming
11-10-2019T03:25:33,SageSaga,yeah i dont think the laptop will cut it for that- its pretty thin and thin laptops thermal throttle
11-10-2019T03:26:03,sunblaze,^that rendering over time takes a lot of juice so it heats up
11-10-2019T03:26:06,MatyMaty,the laptop was like...
11-10-2019T03:26:30,MatyMaty,$1500 usd
11-10-2019T03:26:58,MatyMaty,I wonder if I should keep the wacom and just return the laptop
11-10-2019T03:27:11,MatyMaty,and try to get a $1500 desktop
11-10-2019T03:27:18,SageSaga,do you remember the cost of the desktop you built?
11-10-2019T03:27:28,MatyMaty,yeah it was like
11-10-2019T03:27:43,SageSaga,i think it wasnt quite 2k
11-10-2019T03:27:43,MatyMaty,$2000-$2200 ish
11-10-2019T03:27:57,MatyMaty,if I got an RTX 2070 Super
11-10-2019T03:28:45,SageSaga,you can probably manage it at 1500- if you have some money of your own to throw at it you should be fine
11-10-2019T03:28:54,MatyMaty,I will see if it can be done
11-10-2019T03:29:05,SageSaga,also the Mobile studio can also attach as a normal Cintiq too
11-10-2019T03:29:12,MatyMaty,it can?
11-10-2019T03:29:17,SageSaga,yep
11-10-2019T03:29:24,MatyMaty,How?
11-10-2019T03:29:45,MatyMaty,*googles it*
11-10-2019T03:29:48,SageSaga,it can be used as a portable tablet or you can connect it up and run it as a display
11-10-2019T03:30:19,MatyMaty,so with a wacom link. Or with thunderbolt 3 :P
11-10-2019T03:30:35,SageSaga,is it thunderbolt only?
11-10-2019T03:30:53,MatyMaty,it says it needs a converter called wacom link
11-10-2019T03:31:00,MatyMaty,if you don't have thunderbolt
11-10-2019T03:31:11,MatyMaty,but you lose the 4K with the wacom link
11-10-2019T03:32:53,ZRO4825,"I've been reading good things 'bout the XP-pen tablets lately, but their top of the line doesn't seem to quite compete with Wacom's top of the line stuffs yet :x lol"
11-10-2019T03:33:18,MatyMaty,For what I've read the main issue is the parallax
11-10-2019T03:34:18,MatyMaty,But this is my first screen tablet ever
11-10-2019T03:34:18,ZRO4825,"Hmmm...not sure what that means in reference to a tablet, but I'm also a newb to screen tablets."
11-10-2019T03:34:21,MatyMaty,so I dunno
11-10-2019T03:34:40,MatyMaty,well it means there is a separation between the stylus tip
11-10-2019T03:34:42,ZRO4825,Just started looking into them deeper here recently.
11-10-2019T03:34:42,MatyMaty,and the screen
11-10-2019T03:34:45,ZRO4825,Oh
11-10-2019T03:34:46,SageSaga,the Mobile studio pro is basically as good as it gets
11-10-2019T03:34:57,MatyMaty,XP Pen and Huion have that
11-10-2019T03:35:11,MatyMaty,Wacom and Ipad Pro are the only ones that don't have it
11-10-2019T03:35:19,MatyMaty,since their screens are laminated
11-10-2019T03:35:37,MatyMaty,well the cheap 16 wacom has parallax like a Huion or XP Pen
11-10-2019T03:35:51,ZRO4825,"I wonder how bad of an effect that'd have on someone like me who's used to not even being able to look at the tablet itself, lol"
11-10-2019T03:36:57,MatyMaty,"well yeah Sage, it is a $3000 drwing tablet"
11-10-2019T03:37:15,MatyMaty,that alone makes me queasy about using it :astonished:
11-10-2019T03:37:50,SageSaga,i know- my old companion was 2k
11-10-2019T03:38:04,SageSaga,i get nervous moving more than 30 feet from it
11-10-2019T03:38:09,ZRO4825,":joy: Meanwhile I'm over here going ""what can I get for 200?"" XD"
11-10-2019T03:38:12,MatyMaty,Yeah XP
11-10-2019T03:38:22,MatyMaty,"lol, Zro"
11-10-2019T03:38:31,MatyMaty,I would have *never* bought this on my own
11-10-2019T03:38:33,ZRO4825,Makes sense for you guys though. ^_^
11-10-2019T03:38:58,ZRO4825,One day I might maybe kinda sorta possibly but not really if I don't quit being lazy make it up to almost as good as you guys. :P
11-10-2019T03:39:15,MatyMaty,just practice a lot!
11-10-2019T03:39:28,Mihari,Can't :-\
11-10-2019T03:39:31,ZRO4825,I'm getting better about that!
11-10-2019T03:39:34,MatyMaty,aww :(
11-10-2019T03:39:56,ZRO4825,:(
11-10-2019T03:40:17,MatyMaty,"Like, Scorp. He uses the smallest wacom intuos"
11-10-2019T03:40:26,MatyMaty,and has for years
11-10-2019T03:41:07,Mihari,"If I had a job, and no permanent nerve damage in my hands, I'd probably go with an ipad pro"
11-10-2019T03:41:16,MatyMaty,Yeah that too
11-10-2019T03:41:21,MatyMaty,everyone says its great
11-10-2019T03:41:33,ZRO4825,Really? Scorp's using an intuos like mine? That makes his stuff even more impressive o_o
11-10-2019T03:41:58,SageSaga,i tried the ipad pro for drawing- not a fan of the pencil but it was impressive
11-10-2019T03:42:03,MatyMaty,"well, Scorp's is also like"
11-10-2019T03:42:09,MatyMaty,from 2012
11-10-2019T03:42:15,ZRO4825,oof
11-10-2019T03:42:58,MatyMaty,"Yeah, drawing on Ipad is really nice"
11-10-2019T03:43:06,MatyMaty,if you are willing to use Procreate
11-10-2019T03:43:17,Mihari,clip studio is also an option
11-10-2019T03:43:17,MatyMaty,or pay a subscription for CSP
11-10-2019T03:43:20,Mihari,Yah
11-10-2019T03:43:41,SageSaga,thats honestly the only reason i havent bought one probably
11-10-2019T03:44:05,SageSaga,ive been close a few times to blowing another 2k on a Mobile studio
11-10-2019T03:44:15,MatyMaty,"also if you gonna invest in one for drawing, don't go for the cheaper models"
11-10-2019T03:44:43,MatyMaty,"I got one as a b-day present last year, but has so little ram I can only do like 8 layers in a 3000 x 3000 canvas"
11-10-2019T03:44:56,MatyMaty,since I got the 4 GB ram one
11-10-2019T03:45:40,ZRO4825,New Artist Meme: The 8-layer Challenge.
11-10-2019T03:45:41,MatyMaty,"4 or 6, I don't remember"
11-10-2019T03:45:51,MatyMaty,"lol, Zro"
11-10-2019T03:45:55,MatyMaty,Jinti uses
11-10-2019T03:45:57,MatyMaty,2 layers
11-10-2019T03:46:11,MatyMaty,one for sketch and one for finished drawing
11-10-2019T03:46:17,ZRO4825,"Jinti is a nut. In a good way, lol."
11-10-2019T03:46:32,ZRO4825,That fantasy bullshit comm I got from him is still one of my favorites. :joy:
11-10-2019T03:48:13,SageSaga,they dont even list Ram on the site-
11-10-2019T03:48:34,MatyMaty,yeh
11-10-2019T03:48:50,MatyMaty,I only figured out mine because I had that small layer limit
11-10-2019T03:49:19,MatyMaty,so nowadays I mostly use it to watch videos and streams
11-10-2019T03:50:20,SageSaga,. . . they all only have 2 or 4GBs of ram
11-10-2019T03:52:00,MatyMaty,"well, just don't use huge cavases, Zro :P"
11-10-2019T03:52:17,SageSaga,wut
11-10-2019T03:52:20,MatyMaty,That explains why Slugbox draws on a 4000 x 2000 canvas most time
11-10-2019T03:52:51,SageSaga,well that takes the iPad completely off the table
11-10-2019T03:53:12,ZRO4825,I need to learn to use bigger canvas as is. I have a bad habit of trying to do stuff down in triple digit ranges only. :rofl:
11-10-2019T03:53:43,MatyMaty,XO
11-10-2019T03:53:54,ZRO4825,"Then again not like I'm making groundbreaking masterpieces or anything atm anyway, so kinda not *too* terrible of me. :thinking:"
11-10-2019T03:57:11,MatyMaty,well it depends Zro. Slugbox likes to draw in small canvases. Like 2000-3000 ish. Then resizes to 1200. Jinti just doesn'r resize at all. He draws at like 1600 pixels :P
11-10-2019T03:57:28,MatyMaty,Sage and I do like 6000 pixels and up
11-10-2019T03:58:27,MatyMaty,so you gotta find out what is more comfortable for you
11-10-2019T04:00:16,ZRO4825,"I just need to try to get through more pieces fully. As of right now my shading is god awful, my colorings not much better, and my sketching is still bad. But I have fun doing lines off other people's sketches, so I'm getting better there at least, lol."
11-10-2019T04:00:59,MatyMaty,aww. You just gotta keep trying
11-10-2019T04:01:03,ZRO4825,Yar
11-10-2019T04:01:06,MatyMaty,and practicing}
11-10-2019T04:01:39,ZRO4825,"Just like that one video I found says, ""Finished. Not perfect."""
11-10-2019T04:02:17,MatyMaty,eek but is 4 am over here
11-10-2019T04:02:23,MatyMaty,better hit the bed

11-10-2019T04:02:35,ZRO4825,"5 for me, but I'm a night owl, so meh, lmao"

11-10-2019T04:11:39,ZRO4825,"On that note, I gotta call it a night as well. Stupid morning shifts are making it so I can't keep risking staying up late at random, lol. Ya'll have a good night. ^^/"

11-10-2019T14:09:14,SageSaga,we also needed to go into a room where so far everyone else never came back from - turned out there was a psychotic murderer in there

11-10-2019T14:58:01,ZRO4825,"I think I just shocked myself. Using the whole ""heads tall"" way of measuring a character, I actually sketched this out to just between 7.5 to 8 heads tall without measuring. I'm taking that for the small victory it is."
11-10-2019T15:12:15,RimaDraws,hi sage

11-10-2019T16:39:10,SageSaga,"well when i flat colored the area i went to select it and i was like ""oh- missing line-"" so i filled the whole thing and then erased the extra so i would see it when i did my check again"

11-10-2019T16:43:18,MatyMaty,Yeah
11-10-2019T16:43:23,MatyMaty,4 comics a week are a lot
11-10-2019T16:43:26,SageSaga,just Bad forgetting the rules
11-10-2019T16:43:55,SageSaga,"someone messaged me saying ""3 down from 4 is still 3 times as many as most"" XD"
11-10-2019T16:44:05,Ordithus,:fire:
11-10-2019T16:44:05,MatyMaty,yup :P
11-10-2019T16:44:13,BadFoMo,The not being annoying one or the links one?
11-10-2019T16:44:32,MatyMaty,I know of a couple webcomics that update like once a month
11-10-2019T16:44:35,MatyMaty,:P
11-10-2019T16:44:41,SageSaga,"""Streamers in multi-streams can promote themselves and their works and things they want"""
11-10-2019T16:44:53,BadFoMo,Oh...
11-10-2019T16:44:55,SageSaga,i can link whatever i want
11-10-2019T16:45:08,Ordithus,Not like I'm gonna stop you
11-10-2019T16:45:14,BadFoMo,You can like p0rnz!?
11-10-2019T16:45:20,BadFoMo,*link
11-10-2019T16:45:29,Ordithus,haha good typo
11-10-2019T16:45:48,SageSaga,the stream is still SFW only
11-10-2019T16:45:54,BadFoMo,Oh.
11-10-2019T16:46:00,BadFoMo,Dang.
11-10-2019T16:47:59,MatyMaty,I think Sage
11-10-2019T16:48:07,MatyMaty,that if you ever do a 4th comic
11-10-2019T16:48:14,MatyMaty,or a 4th page
11-10-2019T16:48:16,MatyMaty,rather
11-10-2019T16:48:30,MatyMaty,it must be a new NSFW comic :D
11-10-2019T16:48:47,SageSaga,i was thinking i would work on one of my other projects
11-10-2019T16:49:04,MatyMaty,B-but NSFW
11-10-2019T16:49:38,SageSaga,"like ""I Turned into My Own Waifu!"" or ""One of my Twin Sisters is a Changeling!"""
11-10-2019T16:50:25,MatyMaty,"""I turned into my own waifu"" sounds fun XD"
11-10-2019T16:51:15,Ordithus,least I'd be cute
11-10-2019T16:52:15,SageSaga,"the story about how a guy went to sleep with his new Dakimakura- and when he awoke the pillow was blank but- oh no! He now looks just like her! And- he's not a he anymore!"""
11-10-2019T16:54:25,SageSaga,"One of My Twin Sisters Is a Changeling - the story of a young man with two cute twin sisters, but hes haunted by the memory of when his parents though his only sister vanished from her crib- but wait- he has two sisters now?"
11-10-2019T16:55:02,SageSaga,am i making these sound cheesy enough?
11-10-2019T16:55:14,MatyMaty,"They sound great, Imo XD"
11-10-2019T16:55:16,Ordithus,:cheese:
11-10-2019T16:55:24,BadFoMo,I donno.
11-10-2019T16:55:48,Ordithus,I don't watch much anime.  Both these sound very anime
11-10-2019T16:56:03,SageSaga,they are meant to make fun of the silly light novel titles and ideas while also putting a twist on them
11-10-2019T16:56:47,SageSaga,so like- I turned Into My Own Waifu- turns into a more serious dealing with and understanding the differences in society from being male to being female
11-10-2019T16:57:35,SageSaga,and the Twin Sister deals with the creepy little sister trope Japan keeps using
11-10-2019T17:04:34,SageSaga,im almost done
11-10-2019T17:05:05,BadFoMo,Cool.
11-10-2019T17:06:11,AnuSekaniArt,Looking great Sage :D

11-10-2019T20:58:31,SpazztasticKiwi,chicken fell out of its container and I got a face full of chicken grease
