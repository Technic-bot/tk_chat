15-01-2019T11:49:36,qwe304,"@twokinds Have you considered releasing TDM for non-patreons? It provides a good amount of information about what is presumeably one of the comic's upcoming antagonists, and its rather dissapointing when Im talking to people about the comic,"
15-01-2019T11:50:04,qwe304,and when I bring up events from TDM many people dont know what Im talking about since they havent read it
15-01-2019T12:35:48,NibblyBot,New Patreon Post: Kathrin Practicing the Stern Look https://www.patreon.com/posts/kathrin-stern-24000298
15-01-2019T12:38:19,Twokinds,Wow that's weird.
15-01-2019T12:38:27,Twokinds,Why did it only post just now?
15-01-2019T12:39:29,Twokinds,"Also, yeah, you're right. I've been thinking about it."
15-01-2019T12:39:57,Twokinds,"It's been long enough, I think TDM could be made public at this point."
15-01-2019T12:40:35,Twokinds,Especially since people on Patreon keep requesting pictures of Clovis that are technically big spoilers.
15-01-2019T12:40:37,iliar,What about PPP
15-01-2019T12:40:45,Twokinds,That too.
15-01-2019T12:41:18,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-karenOOO:
15-01-2019T12:42:11,iliar,"Just in case, I will clarify. I can post these comics in my community? Right?"
15-01-2019T12:42:34,Twokinds,Yeah.
15-01-2019T12:43:12,iliar,Good. I'm glad you changed your mind.
15-01-2019T12:43:16,Twokinds,"That makes things easier, right?"
15-01-2019T12:44:05,qwe304,"yeqh, If people can post em they will spread pretty quick"
15-01-2019T12:48:49,Twokinds,"Now that Magical Mishaps is up and running, I will soon have new side comics going on regularly, I hope."
15-01-2019T12:49:00,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-KeithNeat:
15-01-2019T12:49:20,Twokinds,So I'll still have something to sell later at cons anyway XD

15-01-2019T13:13:25,ScarderXD,hej tom if your still here is there a offical tk discord
15-01-2019T13:13:45,Twokinds,Uh... I don't think so
15-01-2019T13:13:58,Twokinds,There's an onofficial one I believe
15-01-2019T13:14:16,ScarderXD,i'm in one
15-01-2019T13:15:12,ScarderXD,so
15-01-2019T13:15:29,qwe304,There’s two
15-01-2019T13:15:33,iliar,Nibs is currently running on 6 Discord servers.
15-01-2019T13:15:38,qwe304,Both have their issues
15-01-2019T13:15:49,qwe304,"Well, two large ones"
15-01-2019T13:16:26,Twokinds,There's six?!
15-01-2019T13:16:26,qwe304,I don’t think it would be good if there were an official one
15-01-2019T13:16:56,ScarderXD,why
15-01-2019T13:17:38,qwe304,"Unless tom has a team of mods that ruled with an iron fist, it would be like hell"
15-01-2019T13:17:59,ScarderXD,oh ok
15-01-2019T13:18:19,Twokinds,Yeah I don't want to maintain a Discord.
15-01-2019T13:18:21,iliar,Some non TK servers are interested about TwoKinds notifications too.
15-01-2019T13:19:31,qwe304,Do you even have a discord account tom?
15-01-2019T13:20:01,Twokinds,"I do, for takling with Sage and other artists"
15-01-2019T13:20:07,Twokinds,And for D&D
15-01-2019T13:20:28,ScarderXD,you play D&D
15-01-2019T13:20:37,Twokinds,Yup.
15-01-2019T13:20:39,qwe304,Yeah if you were in a public discord you’d be pinged and pestered nonstop
15-01-2019T13:20:50,qwe304,He’s mentioned it before
15-01-2019T13:20:55,Twokinds,Probably.
15-01-2019T13:22:11,qwe304,"I just can’t help but think if there were an official one, that it would be the collection of all the worst parts of the unofficial servers combined"
15-01-2019T13:23:00,iliar,I have long wanted to ask. How do you think the D&D rules is hard?
15-01-2019T13:23:09,iliar,"I once tried to start playing, but when the owner of the game gave me several volumes of rules, I suddenly realized that I did not want to play it."
15-01-2019T13:24:02,qwe304,It is very complicated
15-01-2019T13:24:03,CrimsonQuill,I want to give it a go. All the references and examples in the media I read make me want to play it.
15-01-2019T13:24:26,qwe304,I’ve been in one dns game but the GM was horrid
15-01-2019T13:24:37,qwe304,*D&D
15-01-2019T13:25:12,qwe304,How long is the magical mishaps comic going to be?
15-01-2019T13:25:54,ScarderXD,it's fun if you play with the right people
15-01-2019T13:26:27,qwe304,Definitely
15-01-2019T13:26:38,Twokinds,"Right now, it's at 20 pages"
15-01-2019T13:26:43,Twokinds,I suspect it'll be 24 pages
15-01-2019T13:26:50,Twokinds,Same size as PPP and TDM
15-01-2019T13:26:59,CrimsonQuill,Nice.
15-01-2019T13:27:10,CrimsonQuill,I'm looking forward to tonight's page.
15-01-2019T13:27:16,Twokinds,I also have smaller ones planned.
15-01-2019T13:27:22,CrimsonQuill,:ctwokinds-rainehappy:
15-01-2019T13:27:24,Twokinds,Just a few pages.
15-01-2019T13:27:33,CrimsonQuill,That's good
15-01-2019T13:27:42,qwe304,I look forward to them
15-01-2019T13:27:45,Twokinds,I'll probably put those together into a print collection.
15-01-2019T13:28:05,CrimsonQuill,Print collection?
15-01-2019T13:28:12,CrimsonQuill,:ptv-wondering:

15-01-2019T13:28:59,Twokinds,A collection of small comics made into a comic book. An anthology.
15-01-2019T13:29:04,Twokinds,Or... Anthrology.
15-01-2019T13:29:08,CrimsonQuill,"Oh, I see."
15-01-2019T13:29:13,CrimsonQuill,"Good Evening, Azuma."
15-01-2019T13:29:18,Twokinds,Anthro Anthology.
15-01-2019T13:29:24,CrimsonQuill,LOL
15-01-2019T13:29:44,CrimsonQuill,"I finally ""finished"" freefall, yesterday."
15-01-2019T13:29:56,CrimsonQuill,"And by ""Finished"", I mean i got to the latest strip."
15-01-2019T13:30:03,Twokinds,Nice
15-01-2019T13:30:11,CrimsonQuill,"You were right, Tom-it is really well written!"
15-01-2019T13:30:11,Twokinds,That's a long journey
15-01-2019T13:30:16,CrimsonQuill,I binged it
15-01-2019T13:30:26,CrimsonQuill,I read over 350 strips yesterday.
15-01-2019T13:30:32,CrimsonQuill,But I just had to.
15-01-2019T13:30:36,CrimsonQuill,i couldn't stop!
15-01-2019T13:30:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Anthro Anthology Analysis?
15-01-2019T13:30:55,CrimsonQuill,"It's like the first time I read Twokinds all over again, reading more and more each day."
15-01-2019T13:31:07,Twokinds,Some of the ideas I have don't feature any TK characters at all. Though I'm not sure how well they'll be received.
15-01-2019T13:31:12,CrimsonQuill,"Good evening, Spazztastic. :ctwokinds-lynnsmile:"
15-01-2019T13:31:15,Twokinds,I'm not sure if people are expecting them to all by TK related.
15-01-2019T13:31:22,CrimsonQuill,I'm not.
15-01-2019T13:31:30,CrimsonQuill,"You said ""side comics""."
15-01-2019T13:31:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Most may. But they’ll figure it out
15-01-2019T13:31:40,CrimsonQuill,You can put in whatever characters you want.
15-01-2019T13:32:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Surlely they’re grown enough to deal

15-01-2019T13:34:16,CrimsonQuill,Me.
15-01-2019T13:34:20,CrimsonQuill,And my Dad.
15-01-2019T13:34:23,Twokinds,A comic about a guy and his tiger? Ridiculous.
15-01-2019T13:34:30,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-keith8D:
15-01-2019T13:34:41,Azumachan,Sound familiar.

15-01-2019T13:34:52,CrimsonQuill,"D'you think you'll ever reference it, Tom?"
15-01-2019T13:35:00,CrimsonQuill,Because it does have a Deja Vu.
15-01-2019T13:35:01,Twokinds,I dunno
15-01-2019T13:35:16,CrimsonQuill,"That being said, Bill Watterson is VERY adamant about copyright"
15-01-2019T13:35:26,Twokinds,I think there was a sketch suggestion once for a calvin and hobbes sledding panel but instead featuring Flora and Trace
15-01-2019T13:35:30,Twokinds,But it wasn't picked
15-01-2019T13:35:38,CrimsonQuill,I'd've voted for that.
15-01-2019T13:35:46,TerraTheWizard,i vaguely remember that suggestion
15-01-2019T13:35:57,CrimsonQuill,"Calvin: ""I've never seen a sled catch fire before."""
15-01-2019T13:36:01,TerraTheWizard,probably voted for it too
15-01-2019T13:36:02,TerraTheWizard,lol
15-01-2019T13:36:13,CrimsonQuill,"Hobbes: ""We were lucky the pond hadn't frozen over""."
15-01-2019T13:36:23,CrimsonQuill,That strip introduced me to the world of comics.
15-01-2019T13:36:34,CrimsonQuill,Just as Twokinds introduced me to Webcomics.
15-01-2019T13:37:06,Xexanoth,i'd prefer a comic with a short girl and a large anthro dog
15-01-2019T13:37:07,CrimsonQuill,"I have to say (in a rather biased way) that I consider them (And Peanuts, and Fred Basset) to be among the best comics ever."
15-01-2019T13:37:20,Twokinds,C&H is definitely great.
15-01-2019T13:37:21,Xexanoth,noot sure where i picked that up from though :ptv-snicker:
15-01-2019T13:37:26,TerraTheWizard,:P
15-01-2019T13:37:34,TerraTheWizard,noot
15-01-2019T13:37:36,Twokinds,lol
15-01-2019T13:37:40,CrimsonQuill,I haven't read too much Peanuts though... *sob*
15-01-2019T13:37:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Sounds like inuyasha
15-01-2019T13:37:53,CrimsonQuill,"When did you read C&H, Tom?"
15-01-2019T13:37:53,Twokinds,Sam&Colin is coming soon.
15-01-2019T13:37:57,Xexanoth,yay
15-01-2019T13:37:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Well. His parents anyway

15-01-2019T13:38:09,Twokinds,Uh... I had the collection way back when I was a kid.

15-01-2019T13:38:23,CrimsonQuill,"Heh, like I said, I stole my dad's books."
15-01-2019T13:38:24,Twokinds,It's my next year project.
15-01-2019T13:38:28,Twokinds,2020
15-01-2019T13:38:28,TerraTheWizard,neat
15-01-2019T13:38:40,CrimsonQuill,I made it up later by buying a replacement for one of the ones I trashed.
15-01-2019T13:38:41,Twokinds,New Decade new comic
15-01-2019T13:38:45,TerraTheWizard,"oh rigjt, next year is the first year of the future"
15-01-2019T13:38:48,Twokinds,"This year, I'm a bit too swamped with current projects."
15-01-2019T13:39:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Well get out of the swamp
15-01-2019T13:39:09,Twokinds,That's what I'm doing
15-01-2019T13:39:15,CrimsonQuill,I've got one more exam to worry about.
15-01-2019T13:39:17,Xexanoth,"yeah, rather have 1 thing finished then 5 different ones that only move very slowly"
15-01-2019T13:39:22,CrimsonQuill,Then I have a week of free time.
15-01-2019T13:39:28,TerraTheWizard,put enough floofies in the swamp & it'll soack up all the water
15-01-2019T13:39:32,TerraTheWizard,*soak

15-01-2019T13:39:58,CrimsonQuill,On Deviantart!
15-01-2019T13:40:04,CrimsonQuill,On Mondays!
15-01-2019T13:40:35,TerraTheWizard,me: want's to get back into drawin
15-01-2019T13:40:35,CrimsonQuill,"It's like Sam Vimes reading his son ""Where's My Cow"" at six o'clock every evening, in THUD!."
15-01-2019T13:40:43,CrimsonQuill,It's something I have to do.
15-01-2019T13:40:46,TerraTheWizard,also me: starts writing to avoid drawing
15-01-2019T13:40:56,Xexanoth,smart move
15-01-2019T13:41:04,CrimsonQuill,Why not do both?
15-01-2019T13:41:05,Xexanoth,or was it outstanding move?
15-01-2019T13:41:07,Twokinds,I do actually have a plot for Sam&Colin now
15-01-2019T13:41:14,Twokinds,Which took a looong time.
15-01-2019T13:41:16,Xexanoth,i can't keep up with memes anymore
15-01-2019T13:41:17,CrimsonQuill,Cool! :ctwokinds-lynnsmile:

15-01-2019T13:42:41,CrimsonQuill,I want to treat drawing as more than just a hobby.

15-01-2019T13:42:51,CrimsonQuill,Because I never really got into making it one.
15-01-2019T13:43:30,CrimsonQuill,"If I make a decent drawing (and perhaps a dozen poor sketches) every week, I should approach my younger and older sister's levels within a year or two."

15-01-2019T13:43:37,CrimsonQuill,I did not.
15-01-2019T13:43:45,CrimsonQuill,I did Technical Graphics.
15-01-2019T13:44:00,CrimsonQuill,I wish I could've done art AND technical Graphics.
15-01-2019T13:44:08,CrimsonQuill,Or just art...
15-01-2019T13:44:14,CrimsonQuill,*siiiiigh*
15-01-2019T13:44:24,TerraTheWizard,i was part of the last year that got a gcse from graphic design
15-01-2019T13:44:27,TerraTheWizard,it's a btec now
15-01-2019T13:45:05,CrimsonQuill,GCSE...That's definitely in the UK.
15-01-2019T13:45:12,TerraTheWizard,the best/worst part about it is i still use the vector graphics software that we used in school
15-01-2019T13:45:24,TerraTheWizard,best being is i know how it works really well
15-01-2019T13:45:28,TerraTheWizard,bad is it's from 2003
15-01-2019T13:45:33,CrimsonQuill,I'm using this program called ARCGIS to make special maps on different datasets.
15-01-2019T13:45:59,CrimsonQuill,"Theoretically, if you gave me data concerning a coastal town, I could come up with a decent flood risk area map."

15-01-2019T13:46:16,CrimsonQuill,I'm still rather bad at it.
15-01-2019T13:46:25,TerraTheWizard,then they canned fireworks after cs6
15-01-2019T13:46:25,CrimsonQuill,"Macromedia, huh?"
15-01-2019T13:46:32,CrimsonQuill,Never heard of that...
15-01-2019T13:46:37,TerraTheWizard,& i can't afford photoshop
15-01-2019T13:46:47,CrimsonQuill,How much does Photoshop cost?
15-01-2019T13:46:55,TerraTheWizard,too much
15-01-2019T13:47:00,TerraTheWizard,because it's subscription
15-01-2019T13:47:05,CrimsonQuill,Dammit
15-01-2019T13:47:25,CrimsonQuill,"Well, it's lucky that I don't intend to get it till I'm good at drawing..."

15-01-2019T13:48:58,Xexanoth,bye terra
15-01-2019T13:49:11,CrimsonQuill,Just saw the price.
15-01-2019T13:49:34,CrimsonQuill,€37:00 subscription per month.
15-01-2019T13:49:37,CrimsonQuill,Whew.
15-01-2019T13:51:40,Xexanoth,it's a tool for professionals
15-01-2019T13:51:54,CrimsonQuill,And I am no professional.
15-01-2019T13:56:59,CrimsonQuill,I'll be back soon-going to check something
15-01-2019T13:57:15,CrimsonQuill,:ptv-greetings::ctwokinds-rainehappy:
15-01-2019T13:57:56,Xexanoth,have fun
15-01-2019T14:02:27,Mippy,Ugh! Critique took all class
15-01-2019T14:03:18,Mippy,Gonna go home and...I don’t know...watch anime or something
15-01-2019T14:08:54,Dadrobit,"I mean, Photoshop CS2 is technically free."
15-01-2019T14:09:17,Mippy,Is it?
15-01-2019T14:09:36,Mippy,I’m becoming kind of decent in illustrator
15-01-2019T14:10:39,Dadrobit,"Yeah, you can download it totally free. It's anti-piracy software is built to try and access the adobe servers, but those particular servers were shut down in like 2013."
15-01-2019T14:10:46,Dadrobit,Its*
15-01-2019T14:11:18,Dadrobit,So it isn't able to contact them and the program just shrugs it off and lets the user have at it.
15-01-2019T14:12:55,Dadrobit,"Also, the option to buy a perpetual license of CS6. For around a thousand dollars off of Ebay."
15-01-2019T14:13:46,Twokinds,"I have CS5.1. Unfortunately, older versions of Photoshop have bugs that make them not work well with new models of Cintiq."
15-01-2019T14:13:55,Mippy,:ctwokinds-karenOOO: piracy loophole
15-01-2019T14:14:29,Twokinds,The drivers are incompatable and they don't bother fixing stuff that doesn't work in old PS versions.
15-01-2019T14:15:12,Mippy,I need to save up for a better tablet eventually...something with a screen :ctwokinds-floraquestion:
15-01-2019T14:16:15,Dadrobit,Pro Tools has the exact opposite problem. Every update seems to screw up ~something~ that was previously working just fine. I know dozen engineers that refuse to get versions of the software that aren't at least two years old.
15-01-2019T14:16:23,Dadrobit,a dozen*
15-01-2019T14:16:54,Xexanoth,"""never fix a running system"""
15-01-2019T14:19:47,Dadrobit,They do generally fix their problems... Eventually....
15-01-2019T14:20:58,Mippy,So they are kind of at the “why bother?” Point with older version?
15-01-2019T14:23:20,Dadrobit,Photoshop or Pro Tools? Either way. Yes.
15-01-2019T14:25:51,Dadrobit,"PT has also transitioned to subscription models at $25+ per month, though you can still get a perpetual license for $600 with perpetual updates at $100 every following year."
15-01-2019T14:27:55,Dadrobit,"PT Ultimate is only available as a subscription at $1,000 a year, but that version is really only intended for big movie production studios."

15-01-2019T15:18:15,CrimsonQuill,"Well, I'm no one to ask"
15-01-2019T15:18:25,CrimsonQuill,Maybe some of the others are.

15-01-2019T18:24:30,Twokinds,Index funds are a type of investment.
15-01-2019T18:24:51,Twokinds,He was well known in the money world as someone who transformed investing.

15-01-2019T18:28:32,ThingsAreMoving,I'd invest some monies if I didn't have a mentality of a hamster.
15-01-2019T18:28:53,Bgrmystr2,wait so he like.. invented what is now the stock market?

15-01-2019T19:25:39,phil199,hi corin
15-01-2019T19:26:15,InTheLionsDen,The truck should have hit the piggy bank and the truck breaks into a bunch of little pieces.

15-01-2019T19:27:28,Bgrmystr2,to get the money inside
15-01-2019T19:27:35,Bgrmystr2,and then bought a new one later
15-01-2019T19:27:49,Mippy,That’s why there is a hole in the bottom Bgr
15-01-2019T19:28:05,Bgrmystr2,you think people wanted to wait to get the money from the lil hole? :P
15-01-2019T19:28:26,ThingsAreMoving,the hole is just for readjusting the coins to fit more

15-01-2019T19:36:11,Dimensional,"I expect the Golem to go ""My Precious!!"""
15-01-2019T19:36:12,Twokinds,But what if the golem is excited?
15-01-2019T19:36:13,Tharkis,so 'rawr' is mostly just in my head
15-01-2019T19:36:24,Twokinds,How is the golem supposed to express itself if it can't make a sound
15-01-2019T19:36:27,Bgrmystr2,"""Finally something to do!"""

15-01-2019T19:36:58,Dadrobit,"As long as it doesn't piddle on the ground when it gets excited, I'd take most other expressions."
15-01-2019T19:36:59,Tharkis,excitedly hops from foot too foot and grinst toothily

15-01-2019T19:37:58,totallynotTrace,wark wark sounds like mispronouncing work or walk because of a accent
15-01-2019T19:38:00,ThingsAreMoving,is that what you're implying?
15-01-2019T19:38:02,Bgrmystr2,"the elites, phoenix."

15-01-2019T19:38:58,phil199,I mean that's good to hear
15-01-2019T19:39:28,ThingsAreMoving,Wile E Coyote can't exist without a roadrunner

15-01-2019T19:40:56,ThingsAreMoving,guess if Maddie WAS as strong like her mother she'd have no problem dealing with this lizardgolem

15-01-2019T19:44:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Ok everyone. I don’t have headphones in rn so you’re on low volume in the break room. Try to behave
15-01-2019T19:45:00,Bgrmystr2,"he wouldn't be in the streamer slot if he wasn't gonna join, Fomo"
15-01-2019T19:45:08,happyguyone,well I killed the shit out of a whole bandit camp in srkrim so good I guess

15-01-2019T19:45:50,Bgrmystr2,probably setting up account options
15-01-2019T19:45:56,BadFoMo,Oh...
15-01-2019T19:45:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Thankfully chat text doesn’t make noise
15-01-2019T19:46:00,Bgrmystr2,which you can change after you make account.

15-01-2019T20:31:39,CatzArt,But yeah i got cetified since the fires are only getting worse. although the US forest service is buckling under the strain. we need more fire fighters
15-01-2019T20:32:00,CatzArt,and money
15-01-2019T20:32:45,CatzArt,So whats with the Purge on the Twokinds discord server?
15-01-2019T20:32:48,Apostrophe,I lived in Missoula MT for a few years. One of the biggest if not the biggest smoke jumper bases was there
15-01-2019T20:33:10,Tempystral,Specifically which twokinds discord server?
15-01-2019T20:33:12,Tempystral,There are like 4

15-01-2019T20:34:18,Hg17Lamont2002,and that’s what I thought Things
15-01-2019T20:34:36,ThingsAreMoving,the great schism of twokinds discord
15-01-2019T20:34:45,Tempystral,Lots of community drama and a bunch of newcomers split up one skype community into three and from there we got a ton of related discord servers
15-01-2019T20:34:46,Hg17Lamont2002,Lol
15-01-2019T20:34:50,CatzArt,I am a member of the Basidan Island Federation on whatever server on
15-01-2019T20:35:05,CatzArt,im aon
15-01-2019T20:35:12,CatzArt,gah on
15-01-2019T20:35:18,CatzArt,I cant spell
15-01-2019T20:35:26,Hg17Lamont2002,Heh
15-01-2019T20:35:29,ThingsAreMoving,is it even worth being in a TK discord server?
15-01-2019T20:35:39,CatzArt,Yeah I enjoy it
15-01-2019T20:35:42,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"meh, can be fun here and there"
15-01-2019T20:35:44,unsteddyphoenix,Not really
15-01-2019T20:35:55,Hg17Lamont2002,What exactly happens in the servers?
15-01-2019T20:36:01,MarvTheHugPharaoh,from what I learned smaller servers are better
15-01-2019T20:36:09,Tempystral,I haven't really been active in any since I stopped visiting the forums regularly
15-01-2019T20:36:16,Keilani5747,"it's not worth imo, but that's me"
15-01-2019T20:36:19,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah smaller private servers are a lot nicer
15-01-2019T20:36:25,Keilani5747,Your results may vary
15-01-2019T20:36:36,Tempystral,I'm in a few huge servers and they're only good when the majority of people are lurkers
15-01-2019T20:36:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,will say Iliars bots are on point like hot damn
15-01-2019T20:36:44,ThingsAreMoving,"Eh, I'll just stick to picarto chat and occasionally the forums."
15-01-2019T20:36:49,Tempystral,I've been the admin of a 5k+ person server and those are awful
15-01-2019T20:37:05,Hg17Lamont2002,Sounds like a hassle
15-01-2019T20:37:18,Tempystral,It was
15-01-2019T20:37:27,Tempystral,Imagine being a retail manager but not getting paid
15-01-2019T20:37:28,Keilani5747,Servers that have no need for rules are the best ones in my experience
15-01-2019T20:37:38,Hg17Lamont2002,Highest I’ve been in a 300 person discord server
15-01-2019T20:37:48,Hg17Lamont2002,Can’t imagine 5k
15-01-2019T20:38:01,Tempystral,It was not well managed and we were ill-equipped to deal with troublemakers
15-01-2019T20:38:16,Tempystral,And the entire server was predicated on shitposting so that was a bad sign
15-01-2019T20:38:20,Keilani5747,Buuut large servers are cool for finding people that you mesh well with
15-01-2019T20:38:27,ThingsAreMoving,That golem pose is ideal for a shaky emote
15-01-2019T20:38:33,ThingsAreMoving,*angry golem noises*
15-01-2019T20:38:37,Hg17Lamont2002,Lol
15-01-2019T20:38:38,happyguyone,a 5k server that's just damn it all
15-01-2019T20:38:43,Bgrmystr2,@Tempystral @ThingsAreMoving actually there's at least 6 according to how many have the Nibbly bot.
15-01-2019T20:38:44,unsteddyphoenix,*golem attac intensifies*
15-01-2019T20:38:49,Hg17Lamont2002,New emote coming here soon
15-01-2019T20:39:02,ThingsAreMoving,"Thanks for the info, bgr"
15-01-2019T20:39:22,ThingsAreMoving,how many are as fun as sunday stream chat?
15-01-2019T20:39:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Golem boi, smashing into your DM's"
15-01-2019T20:39:30,happyguyone,be a mod on one that is
15-01-2019T20:39:35,Hg17Lamont2002,XD
15-01-2019T20:39:56,Tempystral,Damn that is a lot

15-01-2019T20:40:37,happyguyone,XD
15-01-2019T20:40:42,Bgrmystr2,the discords will never replicate it.
15-01-2019T20:40:58,ThingsAreMoving,I was asking about the levels of fun
15-01-2019T20:41:03,ThingsAreMoving,and entertainment
15-01-2019T20:41:15,Bgrmystr2,yeah and they will never replicate this chat for the amount of fun and entertainment
15-01-2019T20:41:26,ThingsAreMoving,in other words they're a waste of time
15-01-2019T20:41:29,Bgrmystr2,because this is where everyone gets together and enjoys the comic without the drama and garbage of life.
15-01-2019T20:41:29,ThingsAreMoving,QED
15-01-2019T20:41:32,Tempystral,I mean literally any group chat lives and dies by its community
15-01-2019T20:41:38,Bgrmystr2,I dunno about that :u
15-01-2019T20:41:39,CatzArt,But Keilani rules are important on discord servers. Authority is order. Information must be controlled. Power must never be in the hands of rouge elements. Any who oppose you must be destroyed with extreme predjudice. for your safet.y
15-01-2019T20:41:55,Keilani5747,Uhh
15-01-2019T20:42:01,Bgrmystr2,"lol that last part is not how you run a server, Catz"
15-01-2019T20:42:19,CatzArt,Heh its a quote from the dreamkeepers webcomic
15-01-2019T20:42:19,Keilani5747,I can tell you that's how you get people to hate you p easily
15-01-2019T20:42:22,Hg17Lamont2002,Destroyed is a strong word
15-01-2019T20:42:48,CatzArt,Do any of you read the Dreamkeepers webcomic?
15-01-2019T20:42:59,ThingsAreMoving,I stopped at vol. 3
15-01-2019T20:43:05,Bgrmystr2,"it's on my to-do list, but I haven't read it yet"
15-01-2019T20:43:09,RheyareZeta,theres other webcomics other than bloodline and twokinds?????
15-01-2019T20:43:14,Hg17Lamont2002,Never heard of it :0

15-01-2019T20:43:25,Bgrmystr2,"No Rhey, the internet does not exist."

15-01-2019T20:43:58,RheyareZeta,i know what dreamkeepers is catz XD
15-01-2019T20:44:00,Bgrmystr2,outside of this is the end of the internet.

15-01-2019T20:53:47,Hg17Lamont2002,So since Tom is doing a comic stream today...does that mean there will be one on Friday still?

15-01-2019T21:43:54,CatzArt,Why Bgr? I have a race I designed for a comic I got in the works. the races has a culture with inspirations from imperial japan and the german empire. so their helmets are a mix of the picklehaub and a samurai helmet. hope that answers your question.
15-01-2019T21:44:10,TheRagingRedfox,"Hmm, when Trace calls Flora „duchess“ in their bedroom and trace brushes Floras tail, she seems clearly bigger... my opinion..."
15-01-2019T21:44:14,Bgrmystr2,"Catz, none of that matters when you're drawing when you should be watching the stream."
15-01-2019T21:44:19,Bgrmystr2,focus is elsewhere.
15-01-2019T21:44:25,Bgrmystr2,and that's just unacceptable.
15-01-2019T21:44:25,Hg17Lamont2002,Dragon Nat vs Rocky who would win
