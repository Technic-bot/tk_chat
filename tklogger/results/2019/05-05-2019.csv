05-05-2019T00:01:24,Bgrmystr2,"what, he's really a thing"
05-05-2019T00:01:25,Twokinds,"I picked him as a joke because of his name, and also because he's been called one of the top 5 worst Avengers."
05-05-2019T00:02:57,SpazztasticKiwi,I figured he existed. I just didn’t bother googling
05-05-2019T00:03:02,Bgrmystr2,I thought he wasn't real and we were just talking about.. Star Fox.. yknow from StarFox
05-05-2019T00:03:11,Bgrmystr2,xD
05-05-2019T00:03:18,Bgrmystr2,I'm not into the whole marvel thing so ehhh
05-05-2019T00:05:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Where tf was this guy when his brother was wanting to kill half the universe
05-05-2019T00:05:33,Bgrmystr2,"btw tom I wanted to ask, do you plan to keep the votes to only patrons or are you interested in adding other accounts on patreon that you know from the stream that aren't going to be rigging stuff?"
05-05-2019T00:05:50,Bgrmystr2,cuz I noticed the poll numbers dropped to 1/3 of what they were
05-05-2019T00:05:59,SpazztasticKiwi,And how come this guy looks rather attractive while Thanos looks like a crusty ass raisin
05-05-2019T00:06:13,Bgrmystr2,was just curious as to if you had a plan or whatever.
05-05-2019T00:06:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Like the half demon thing in Inuyasha: for every pretty half demon born there’s an odd looking one born too
05-05-2019T00:07:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Ramble done. Bout to go 🛌
05-05-2019T00:07:56,Bgrmystr2,gnite
05-05-2019T00:08:27,SpazztasticKiwi,They have me as the morning cook. 4 hour morning shift. On Monday
05-05-2019T00:10:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Don’t wanna
05-05-2019T00:24:40,Twokinds,I don't know how the vote is going to work.
05-05-2019T00:24:45,Twokinds,It's too late for me to think about it.
05-05-2019T00:25:01,Bgrmystr2,it's okay
05-05-2019T00:26:00,Bgrmystr2,It's food for thought I guess
05-05-2019T00:27:28,iliar,I think the best choice will be to wait a couple of months and see how the new system will work.
05-05-2019T00:30:12,SpazztasticKiwi,I got tied into spending time with peoples. So I wasn’t present for most
05-05-2019T00:32:47,iliar,The only thing I dream about. Someday you will make a preliminary vote. To be able to vote before the stream.
05-05-2019T00:32:58,iliar,You know. The problem with time zones. This is not cool when voting starts at 4:30 AM.
05-05-2019T00:33:50,Bgrmystr2,"well, if it was impossible to rig the vote, that'd be fine, but tom allows people to submit things all the way up to right before the stream."
05-05-2019T00:34:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Then he gets to organize them all. Yea
05-05-2019T00:34:27,Bgrmystr2,which kind of prevents people from voting if the suggestions aren't all in till the stream happens anyway
05-05-2019T00:40:50,SpazztasticKiwi,"Alles klar, I’m out"
05-05-2019T00:49:54,Twokinds,I have considered preliminary votes.
05-05-2019T00:50:05,Twokinds,For example: doing something like I do for the color vote.
05-05-2019T00:50:22,Twokinds,Give people 1 day to vote on their favorites from all the options.
05-05-2019T00:50:26,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
05-05-2019T00:55:18,unsteddyphoenix,Eh. Occams razor.
05-05-2019T00:55:24,unsteddyphoenix,lets just see how this goes for a bit
05-05-2019T00:55:47,iliar,"And yes. Making a choice from all the suggestions is a good idea. The division into rounds is random. Sometimes a few great ideas fall into one round. And sometimes: meh, meh, meh, hm that's better then others but still meh, meh, meh."
05-05-2019T00:56:05,RimaDraws,hm
05-05-2019T00:56:44,Bgrmystr2,but that's how it goes for anyone. Not all suggestions will fit everyone's interests. They're all equal
05-05-2019T01:05:19,unsteddyphoenix,My interests are the correct interests though
05-05-2019T01:05:30,Bgrmystr2,"for you, yes. xD"
05-05-2019T01:09:35,unsteddyphoenix,objectilvey
05-05-2019T01:12:06,Bgrmystr2,"cute, but I'll keep my own correct interests, thanks :)"
05-05-2019T01:12:24,Bgrmystr2,"a few of them line up with yours, the rest you just have to deal with."
05-05-2019T01:12:35,RimaDraws,correct interests?
05-05-2019T01:14:41,Bgrmystr2,haha yes absolutely
05-05-2019T01:14:53,Bgrmystr2,correctness intensifies
05-05-2019T01:17:49,RimaDraws,sorry i dozed off. ive had a busy day
05-05-2019T01:57:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I can’t sleep

05-05-2019T12:02:02,CrimsonQuill,Good evening everyone
05-05-2019T12:07:39,TerraTheWizard,6pm isn't really evening is it?

05-05-2019T14:13:26,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s 80 and I got a coat on I’m still so cold
05-05-2019T14:13:38,SpazztasticKiwi,My internal thermostat is broken
05-05-2019T14:13:46,CrimsonQuill,80 farenheit?
05-05-2019T14:13:50,CrimsonQuill,What's that in Celsius?
05-05-2019T14:19:41,TerraTheWizard,25 ish
05-05-2019T14:57:36,CrimsonQuill,I see
05-05-2019T14:58:06,CrimsonQuill,"By the way, how come there is no recording of last night's stream?"
05-05-2019T15:12:43,TerraTheWizard,no idea
05-05-2019T15:12:51,CrimsonQuill,hmmm
05-05-2019T15:13:14,TerraTheWizard,if you really need to see it there's always the youtube stream archive https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tqTXPeSGlY
05-05-2019T15:20:29,CrimsonQuill,Thanks
05-05-2019T15:20:38,CrimsonQuill,I wanted to go over the Rose sketch again
05-05-2019T15:25:18,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-rose:
05-05-2019T16:14:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Trying to tell myself I don’t need it https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/524825976597643265/575067786573905930/image0.jpg
05-05-2019T16:15:42,CrimsonQuill,What sort of flowers are they? I don't recognise them.
05-05-2019T16:17:53,TerraTheWizard,is that one of them cactuses people like these days
05-05-2019T16:20:31,SpazztasticKiwi,It says it’s a calandiva
05-05-2019T16:27:57,Bgrmystr2,mornin guys
05-05-2019T16:28:05,CrimsonQuill,hibgr
05-05-2019T16:28:09,CrimsonQuill,Oh I see SPazz
05-05-2019T16:30:27,Bgrmystr2,"1.5gb for 6 1/2 hrs of 1080p? Ouch, the compression is real"
05-05-2019T16:33:53,Bgrmystr2,6 1/2 video format from picarto for a similar stream length is bout 7.4gb
05-05-2019T16:34:11,Bgrmystr2,least it's there for people to watch.
05-05-2019T16:34:30,CrimsonQuill,Imagine if it were uncompressed...
05-05-2019T16:34:40,CrimsonQuill,I'm guessing 7 gb
05-05-2019T16:34:44,Bgrmystr2,7.4gb is uncompressed yeah
05-05-2019T16:34:51,CrimsonQuill,Youcha
05-05-2019T16:34:59,Bgrmystr2,or compressed very lightly
05-05-2019T16:35:10,CrimsonQuill,I am glad someone made that channel.
05-05-2019T16:35:33,Bgrmystr2,"actual raw video is obscenely large, but tom's only running 1080p so 7gb for 6 hrs sounds about right"
05-05-2019T16:35:58,Bgrmystr2,"yeah Iliar is pretty hero for that, not gonna lie"
05-05-2019T16:36:04,CrimsonQuill,"When I had finally caught up with the comic, I gave myself a treat by re-watching the Halo Raine sketching after finishing Halo 4 on Legendary again."
05-05-2019T16:36:11,CrimsonQuill,"Wait, that's Iliar's channel?"
05-05-2019T16:36:15,CrimsonQuill,Nice!
05-05-2019T16:36:34,Bgrmystr2,"you can find that in the ""about"" page on the channel lol.."
05-05-2019T16:36:35,Bgrmystr2,xD
05-05-2019T16:36:43,CrimsonQuill,"Just how much has Iliar done for this fandom? Nibblybot, stream channel..."
05-05-2019T16:36:47,CrimsonQuill,:)
05-05-2019T16:37:08,CrimsonQuill,I am wondering if Tom is ever going to update the character page on the site.
05-05-2019T16:37:37,Bgrmystr2,"well, he wasn't the first to make bots. Amenon already had the TKpolls bot"
05-05-2019T16:37:38,CrimsonQuill,"Change the pictures of the characters to those in his current art style, that sort of thing."
05-05-2019T16:37:44,CrimsonQuill,Oh I see
05-05-2019T16:37:45,Bgrmystr2,iliar made an alternative one
05-05-2019T16:37:55,CrimsonQuill,I couldn't make a bit
05-05-2019T16:37:57,CrimsonQuill,bot
05-05-2019T16:38:02,CrimsonQuill,I can't code
05-05-2019T16:39:02,Bgrmystr2,most can't.
05-05-2019T16:39:51,CrimsonQuill,It's a problem because the GIS I am meant to use requires some code...
05-05-2019T16:40:09,CrimsonQuill,I only hope that I can find a niche where most of the work is practical.
05-05-2019T16:40:26,CrimsonQuill,But the bots are awesome here.
05-05-2019T16:42:35,iliar,"You're right. A typical stream size is 6-8 GB, depending on the length."
05-05-2019T16:42:54,CrimsonQuill,Evening Iliar. :ptv-victory::ptv-greetings:
05-05-2019T16:43:06,CrimsonQuill,Kudos to you for doing all of that stuff.
05-05-2019T16:44:13,iliar,https://twokinds.gallery/ This can also be added to the list of my things.
05-05-2019T16:44:47,CrimsonQuill,CRUMBS.
05-05-2019T16:45:02,CrimsonQuill,This is like the sorting system Tom has on Patreon...
05-05-2019T16:46:24,CrimsonQuill,Wow.
05-05-2019T16:46:33,CrimsonQuill,How long did it take you to make this>
05-05-2019T16:46:34,CrimsonQuill,?
05-05-2019T16:47:42,CrimsonQuill,"Welp, this is going in my bookmarks."
05-05-2019T16:48:38,iliar,I suddenly noticed that Patreon tags are case sensitive. https://yadi.sk/i/aK4H8zgKdz5NPQ
05-05-2019T16:50:13,CrimsonQuill,wut
05-05-2019T16:51:27,iliar,"I also want to do a similar thing with fan art, but this is not ready yet. https://twokinds.gallery/fanarts.jsp"
05-05-2019T16:51:29,Bgrmystr2,haha Maren and maren are obviously not the same person according to patreon
05-05-2019T16:53:35,TerraTheWizard,"yeah, case sensitivity of tags is hell"
05-05-2019T16:54:06,TerraTheWizard,i followed someone who had 500 tags because they can't stick to their case rules
05-05-2019T16:55:19,CrimsonQuill,"When my best friend told me about the comic, he told me to not look at the fanart, because while there is doubtless some good stuff there, it would be obscured by the...brain-bleach-required stuff."
05-05-2019T16:56:19,CrimsonQuill,Though I have seen a few...
05-05-2019T16:56:31,iliar,I understand you. I try to filter fan art with extreme fetishes.
05-05-2019T16:56:37,CrimsonQuill,RimaDraws had a lovely picture of Madelyn.
05-05-2019T16:57:40,SpazztasticKiwi,The deeper you go in a fandom the more monsters want to love you
05-05-2019T16:58:02,iliar,I don't understand why people order fan art from a dead Reni or similar things.
05-05-2019T16:58:13,Bgrmystr2,"""Love"" is a strong word, kiwi, but ..yes I would say that is prettymuch true"
05-05-2019T16:59:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Well I was gonna day “f you” but I thought I’d be clean about it
05-05-2019T17:00:00,SpazztasticKiwi,and use love
05-05-2019T17:00:08,Bgrmystr2,":ptv-ohmy: oooh, yes in that context that is absolutely true."
05-05-2019T17:00:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Which reminds me of https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/524825976597643265/575078913936588840/image0.jpg
05-05-2019T17:00:27,Bgrmystr2,haha
05-05-2019T17:00:49,Bgrmystr2,"hey, if the monster is not an enemy anymore.. that means it's potentially an ally, yes?"
05-05-2019T17:00:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Made me laugh more than it should. Don’t know any dnd really but I got it
05-05-2019T17:01:07,Bgrmystr2,legitimate strategy
05-05-2019T17:01:14,CrimsonQuill,Not really going to look
05-05-2019T17:01:27,CrimsonQuill,"Also, hey RvB reference bgr"
05-05-2019T17:01:31,Bgrmystr2,"you can look at that one, it's fine"
05-05-2019T17:01:39,Bgrmystr2,"and no, not an RvB reference"
05-05-2019T17:01:44,Bgrmystr2,just fact of life :)
05-05-2019T17:02:11,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t post nsfw. Tom might not be streaming but he still doesn’t allow it
05-05-2019T17:02:43,Bgrmystr2,I wouldn't call it a hammer though. Mace of Probability would be much more accurate.
05-05-2019T17:03:21,CrimsonQuill,"Well, I'm going to say goodnight."
05-05-2019T17:03:29,CrimsonQuill,It's 11pm

05-05-2019T17:14:40,SpazztasticKiwi,small question
05-05-2019T17:15:17,SpazztasticKiwi,is it a good idea to put a case of water on the toolbox of your truck and expect it to stay
05-05-2019T17:15:32,Bgrmystr2,"yes, small question, one day you will grow into a larger question.. it's one of those mysteries of life."
05-05-2019T17:16:13,Bgrmystr2,"also, I don't know what that referrs to, so :v"
05-05-2019T17:16:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Someone just unload groceries in truck and drive off with water on the toolbox
05-05-2019T17:18:35,Bgrmystr2,well the only toolbox I know of is something that goes in the garage or whatever.. and holds tools.. and is kind of several foot tall and made of metal.
05-05-2019T17:19:53,Bgrmystr2,not something you'd want on your car lol
05-05-2019T17:21:35,SpazztasticKiwi,The big metal box thing some people put in the back of trucks

05-05-2019T17:26:04,Bgrmystr2,yeah you put anything on that it'll just slide off.
05-05-2019T17:29:07,SpazztasticKiwi,what I was imagining. One yee haw around a corner and phlap
05-05-2019T17:30:00,Bgrmystr2,haha yeah
05-05-2019T17:32:00,SonOfGoku,I remember my boss once placed a can of soda on the bumper of his truck then drove 50 miles and when he got out he noticed it was still there
05-05-2019T17:37:04,Bgrmystr2,yeah some things like that work because the wind won't knock it off and driving doesn't always guarantee shaking a vehicle around to knock stuff over
05-05-2019T17:42:09,SonOfGoku,Most of the trip was on the freeway but he drove up a gravel driveway to the job site

05-05-2019T21:33:18,FloofyCat,sdfsdgfdsa I pressed enter accidently
05-05-2019T21:33:38,FloofyCat,Do our Patreon names have to be same as Picarto or something?
05-05-2019T21:37:30,Bgrmystr2,tom does the sketch streams every sunday as stated in the bubble at the top of the chat
05-05-2019T21:37:36,Bgrmystr2,he usually does the suggestion thing... thurs?
05-05-2019T21:37:38,Bgrmystr2,friday?
05-05-2019T21:37:39,Bgrmystr2,ish..
05-05-2019T21:38:04,Bgrmystr2,"you usually have sat and sun morning to put them in, or so before the stream starts"
05-05-2019T21:38:25,Bgrmystr2,and your name doesn't have to be the same as your picarto name
05-05-2019T21:38:45,Bgrmystr2,he will use the name on patreon for the request though
05-05-2019T21:38:51,Bgrmystr2,rather than the name on picarto
05-05-2019T22:13:29,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
05-05-2019T22:22:51,SpazztasticKiwi,waiting on Floras electrical assault to be posted
05-05-2019T22:23:48,SpazztasticKiwi,I didn’t figure it’d get voted first time
05-05-2019T22:25:07,Bgrmystr2,"that was yours, wasn't it?"
05-05-2019T22:25:31,Bgrmystr2,"Yeah, you're a fucking hero, kiwi"
05-05-2019T22:29:50,SpazztasticKiwi,"I was thinking more along the lines of she casually walks across a wool rug to Trace and shocks the fire out of him due to her naively of static, her fur, and such and so"
05-05-2019T22:30:22,SpazztasticKiwi,But Tom went for blood
05-05-2019T22:30:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"Like a real couple would, I’ve decided"
05-05-2019T22:30:56,Bgrmystr2,that's exactly how flora would have done it
05-05-2019T22:31:02,Bgrmystr2,she's that kind of person
05-05-2019T22:31:34,SpazztasticKiwi,You get in a relationship some interactions where you try your best to drive them into a straight jacket
05-05-2019T22:31:47,SpazztasticKiwi,that was English
05-05-2019T22:32:01,Bgrmystr2,"those are the only relationship interactions worth having, honestly."
05-05-2019T22:32:05,Bgrmystr2,rest are boring.
05-05-2019T22:32:24,Bgrmystr2,"if it's not shenanigans in some way, ain't worth."
05-05-2019T22:32:45,SpazztasticKiwi,The evil. It’s like she waits for after his shower - payback for the cola ad
05-05-2019T22:33:10,Bgrmystr2,I highly doubt trace had anything to do with the cola ad though xD
05-05-2019T22:34:00,SpazztasticKiwi,The running idea that she asks him if he notices anything different and he’s just like 🦗 “no..”
05-05-2019T22:34:25,Bgrmystr2,wait.. what is that supposed to be
05-05-2019T22:34:39,SpazztasticKiwi,If I had the conductive ability she had I’d do the same thing
05-05-2019T22:34:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Right on the side of the neck. Or ear
05-05-2019T22:35:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Did the emoji box up again
05-05-2019T22:35:16,Bgrmystr2,no I see it
05-05-2019T22:35:19,Bgrmystr2,but I can't tell what it is
05-05-2019T22:35:23,SpazztasticKiwi,It a cricket
05-05-2019T22:35:26,Bgrmystr2,just looks like some kind of brown triangle lol
05-05-2019T22:35:53,SpazztasticKiwi,emojis are tiny for some reason on some sites
05-05-2019T22:35:55,Bgrmystr2,xD
05-05-2019T22:36:09,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s like they’re trying to encourage actual conversation with words
05-05-2019T22:36:19,SpazztasticKiwi,And not modern Pictionary
05-05-2019T22:39:12,SpazztasticKiwi,That unfortunately reminds me of the other day. Dude I don’t know sends me a set of rapid fire messages
05-05-2019T22:40:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Why’s messenger allow non friends to message you
05-05-2019T22:40:24,Bgrmystr2,dunno
05-05-2019T22:40:46,Bgrmystr2,how would you talk to anyone in the first place to become friends if you can't message people you're not friends with?
05-05-2019T22:42:19,SpazztasticKiwi,For the sake of my sanity I don’t try chats without some sort of anonymity or recognition of the person
05-05-2019T22:42:52,Bgrmystr2,don't join mmos then XD
05-05-2019T22:43:19,Bgrmystr2,or talk in public chats like this one... where ANYONE could join.. at any time.
05-05-2019T22:48:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh off subject but rather important - you know they’re suggesting anyone born before (and including) 1989 get a measles booster because of how bad the outbreaks are
05-05-2019T22:53:09,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-wondering: eh.
05-05-2019T22:55:49,SpazztasticKiwi,anti vaxers are causing outbreaks and opportunities for virus mutations. So much they’re recommending boosters for some who may have the vaccine but an older version
05-05-2019T22:56:15,SpazztasticKiwi,people stupid
05-05-2019T22:57:56,Bgrmystr2,"you know people that are vaccinated can just as easily be carriers. Also, the shots contain the virus itself, which can by itself spread before the person's body completely removes it from the system."
05-05-2019T22:58:48,Bgrmystr2,"so blaming it on one set of people is really just fear mongering generally. It's probably true to some extent, but not the exaggerated widespread outbreak they're trying to make it out to be"
05-05-2019T22:59:41,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s clearly not zombie outbreak bad I know but it’s still stupid
05-05-2019T23:00:24,Bgrmystr2,"viruses like that spread and adapt, so of course the shots are a repeat thing. Which only proves that it doesn't get rid of the virus itself"
05-05-2019T23:00:53,SpazztasticKiwi,It was just about declared dead until now. I was wondering if that potato placebo thing was ever going to cause any interest
05-05-2019T23:01:07,Bgrmystr2,"which is the sad part. You could vaccinate everyone on the planet and the virus would eventually just adapt and become something new, irrelevant of how close you were. That's how they work."
05-05-2019T23:01:14,SpazztasticKiwi,likely a joke though so eh
05-05-2019T23:02:06,SpazztasticKiwi,don’t go outside and never socialize - easiest virus immunity
05-05-2019T23:03:10,Bgrmystr2,"If anything, all the anti vaxxer bandwagon raises nothing but red flags to me. We've had modern medicine for years now, and magically all the sudden diseases are popping up like the 1600s? I'm honestly not buying it."
05-05-2019T23:03:27,Bgrmystr2,"I don't care either way, but fuck needles."
05-05-2019T23:04:01,Bgrmystr2,I just stay home and meet with noone
05-05-2019T23:04:08,Bgrmystr2,and then no problems :)
