28-12-2019T16:10:15,Greendyes,"damn this month is a god one, thats a verry nice chistmas present indeed"

28-12-2019T16:11:01,BowlOfSomething,Or that one that tom did art of her before
28-12-2019T16:11:03,Xexanoth,It's a random Tiger Chief that the human explorers encounter

28-12-2019T16:25:57,MviluUatusun,Boodly shoelaces always knotting at the most inopportune times.

28-12-2019T16:26:56,BadFoMo,Sketch request: Emo Tiget Boy Ref Sheet. Yes or No?

28-12-2019T16:27:00,Sclimshady,"Wait, wut"
28-12-2019T16:27:02,ThingsAreMoving,It's like with printers. Don't even think that you need something printed urgently
28-12-2019T16:27:13,BadFoMo,Ah! *Tiger
28-12-2019T16:27:19,MviluUatusun,"Oh, don't I know that one, Things."

28-12-2019T16:29:10,RimaDraws,alot of us had flu or bronchitis
28-12-2019T16:29:12,BadFoMo,@ThingsAreMoving Oh! I vote for one of my kinks!
28-12-2019T16:29:23,ThingsAreMoving,"Same here, Rima. With the sickness."
28-12-2019T16:29:29,Werewing,New fad to replace char sheets? How about Character Dioramas?
28-12-2019T16:29:51,MviluUatusun,Owch!  You got my sympathies where bronchitis is concerned.  That used to be an annual affair for me.
28-12-2019T16:30:33,RimaDraws,i got lucky with sinuses
28-12-2019T16:30:52,RimaDraws,ive been sick 4 times in the last two months
28-12-2019T16:31:06,BadFoMo,My Christmas was meh. We sort of forgot it was Christmas most of the day.
28-12-2019T16:32:01,MviluUatusun,"I spent most of Christmas on my computer writing.  While writing, I decided to see about part 3 of my story and saw that about 5 chapters I'd written were missing from my portable harddrive."
28-12-2019T16:32:02,ThingsAreMoving,Four times? Yikes!
28-12-2019T16:33:01,BadFoMo,"Also, I remember how my 'friend' had bronchitis shortly before Halloween. dude could barly breath at times."
28-12-2019T16:33:14,MviluUatusun,I'm going to see if I can find a way to recover those files.  I surely hope so.  They were very well written.
28-12-2019T16:33:28,RimaDraws,"mhm i had IBS hit me, then upper respiratory, stomach virus, then sinuses"
28-12-2019T16:33:31,Shierna,Spent most of my Christmas break chasing a stupid kitten off the furniture...
28-12-2019T16:33:35,Werewing,Wow. That's a fancy magic cape.
28-12-2019T16:33:49,Werewing,My D&D bard would be jealous.
28-12-2019T16:34:01,MviluUatusun,@Shierna LOL.
28-12-2019T16:34:23,Shierna,"Got the shit scratched outta my hand, too..."
28-12-2019T16:34:29,Greendyes,fancy tigress in fancy clothing lol

28-12-2019T16:36:30,AnuSekaniArt,Ey Rima!
28-12-2019T16:36:32,MviluUatusun,"The podiatrist says it's nothing to worry about, other than it's on the bottom of my foot."
28-12-2019T16:36:40,ThingsAreMoving,"Oh, the one that is removed by freezing"
28-12-2019T16:36:57,ThingsAreMoving,Had one on my hand when I was younger.
28-12-2019T16:36:59,MviluUatusun,"No, this is rather large.  It has to be dug out."
28-12-2019T16:37:12,ThingsAreMoving,Oof.
28-12-2019T16:37:14,RimaDraws,oof
28-12-2019T16:37:25,BadFoMo,Again; dang!
28-12-2019T16:37:41,ThingsAreMoving,"Well, you better plan out those two weeks or you'll get bored out of your senses"
28-12-2019T16:38:24,ThingsAreMoving,This is my 7th day off work and I just want to be back and get busy
28-12-2019T16:38:48,BadFoMo,"...Also, see if you can record the removal; that can be YouTube gold."
28-12-2019T16:38:58,ThingsAreMoving,ew
28-12-2019T16:39:46,Werewing,"And if anyone questions your mobility, you have visual proof."
28-12-2019T16:40:39,ThingsAreMoving,"I would expect the surgery will give him a slip, or health certificate or however it's called"
28-12-2019T16:41:12,MviluUatusun,I can't remember what the growth is but it's a fibroma of some kind.
28-12-2019T16:41:39,TheFreindlyDeathclaw,lovin the music

28-12-2019T16:42:31,MviluUatusun,"I wouldn't want to watch the video, FoMo.  I've got a weak stomach.  LOL."
28-12-2019T16:43:28,MviluUatusun,"I'm going to spend most of my time, writing.  I really want to finish my current story and post it.  I'm going to start posting it a week from Sunday."
28-12-2019T16:44:05,MviluUatusun,Oops.  I mean next Sunday.  (I forgot todays is Sunday.)
28-12-2019T16:45:19,MviluUatusun,I finally found out what it's called.  It's dermatofibroma.
28-12-2019T16:47:10,MviluUatusun,It's benign but can be painful on the bottom of the toes and/or foot.  Mine is on my left big toe and the ball of the foot behind it.
28-12-2019T16:48:10,ThingsAreMoving,It looks like it wouldn't even need to be extracted it the location wasn't so unfortunate
28-12-2019T16:48:17,ThingsAreMoving,if*
28-12-2019T16:48:48,MviluUatusun,"That's exactly what my doctor said, Things."
28-12-2019T16:48:49,ThingsAreMoving,Anyways good luck on your surgery and recovery
28-12-2019T16:49:44,MviluUatusun,"Thanks.  I'm more worried about potential pain since it has to be dug out rather than cut out.  But, with very little extra skin on the bottom of the toes and foot, that's what they have to do."
28-12-2019T16:50:11,TheFreindlyDeathclaw,such a lovely tigress
28-12-2019T16:50:22,MviluUatusun,"Ain't she, Deathclaw?"
28-12-2019T16:50:51,TheFreindlyDeathclaw,the lovliest
28-12-2019T16:51:18,ThingsAreMoving,Would gift her a huge cardboard box
28-12-2019T16:51:28,BowlOfSomething,Flora is betterer
28-12-2019T16:51:43,MviluUatusun,"Aw.  You're such a flirt, Bowl.  LOL."
28-12-2019T16:51:52,TheFreindlyDeathclaw,Flora is <3
28-12-2019T16:51:55,MviluUatusun,Oops.  I meant things.
28-12-2019T16:52:03,BowlOfSomething,She's just cuter okay
28-12-2019T16:52:07,MviluUatusun,BBS.  Gotta fold clothes.
28-12-2019T16:52:16,ThingsAreMoving,Kitties love cardboard boxes
28-12-2019T16:52:20,AcePilotIV,hi
28-12-2019T16:52:23,ThingsAreMoving,o/
28-12-2019T16:52:41,AcePilotIV,hows everyone?
28-12-2019T16:52:59,TheFreindlyDeathclaw,Hi Ace
28-12-2019T16:53:08,TheFreindlyDeathclaw,im playing jedi fallen order
28-12-2019T16:53:22,AcePilotIV,nice
28-12-2019T16:53:29,ThingsAreMoving,"I am fine. Had to clean up a kimchi fermentation accident before I could attend the stream, but It's ok now"
28-12-2019T16:53:43,BluePhantom90,I have wanted to try and suggest other idea's like the Lewis and Clark guys traveling in the tiger territory to see a tribe of actors and do a show for them.
28-12-2019T16:53:49,TheOtherEric,"Who doesnt love boxes, Things?"
28-12-2019T16:54:24,ThingsAreMoving,Hmmm
28-12-2019T16:54:40,BluePhantom90,"Or see a Tiger tribe treat a new born white tiger cub, or golden tiger cub."
28-12-2019T16:54:42,ThingsAreMoving,The people collecting them for recycling?
28-12-2019T16:54:52,ThingsAreMoving,idk
28-12-2019T16:55:22,TheFreindlyDeathclaw,or an Albino tiger cub
28-12-2019T16:55:35,BluePhantom90,Albina is a white tiger
28-12-2019T16:55:43,BluePhantom90,*albino
28-12-2019T16:55:49,TheFreindlyDeathclaw,i feel stupid now
28-12-2019T16:56:40,ThingsAreMoving,albino would be completely white
28-12-2019T16:56:41,BluePhantom90,There are many different tiger pigments with different fur patterns. Some tigers that almost look like they have no stripes and lighter fur
28-12-2019T16:56:42,SpazztasticKiwi,this is like visiting Korea and finding out the baths are public
28-12-2019T16:56:48,ThingsAreMoving,white tigers stil lhave black stripes
28-12-2019T16:56:52,ThingsAreMoving,still*
28-12-2019T16:57:05,Elosan,I like the tiger on the right.  Wonder what is going through her head haha
28-12-2019T16:57:16,SpazztasticKiwi,kitty is kitty no matter what color
28-12-2019T16:58:35,TheFreindlyDeathclaw,you mean emo tiger?
28-12-2019T16:58:38,BluePhantom90,Not really all kitties either will kill you or cuddle you. It all has to do with them being able to purr. Cougars could be pets.
28-12-2019T16:58:58,ThingsAreMoving,I bet there are people with coguars as pets
28-12-2019T16:59:09,BluePhantom90,but still have that wild beast inside them
28-12-2019T16:59:15,ShockStuff,As long as you keep a good supply of raw meat the kitties won't hurt you
28-12-2019T16:59:18,ThingsAreMoving,Like all animals *shrug*
28-12-2019T16:59:24,BluePhantom90,There is a couple that has a Cougar as a pet
28-12-2019T17:01:13,BluePhantom90,"You could have a Lynx, or Bobcat but it all requires licences and training to get them. But Bobcats and Lynxes are as close as you could get to making a wild cat a house pet. Cheetah's can be tamed like dogs though"
28-12-2019T17:01:44,BluePhantom90,Plus they wont kill you with your back is turned to them
28-12-2019T17:02:23,ThingsAreMoving,Just tattoo a pair of eyes on the back of your neck
28-12-2019T17:02:56,MviluUatusun,Okay.  I'm back for a few minutes.
28-12-2019T17:03:19,BluePhantom90,lol that was the joke with Tigers having a white spots on the back of their ears. The white spots are fake eyes for those hunting them.
28-12-2019T17:03:50,BluePhantom90,"The real question is, What hunt tigers besides humans."
28-12-2019T17:04:04,Werewing,Aliens.
28-12-2019T17:04:09,ThingsAreMoving,I thought these white spots were there for the cubs to follow
28-12-2019T17:04:10,MviluUatusun,"Tiger cubs are hunted by bears, Blue."
28-12-2019T17:04:23,Elosan,Yeah the emo tigers Spazz
28-12-2019T17:04:34,Elosan,*tiger
28-12-2019T17:04:44,TheFreindlyDeathclaw,Emo Tigger?
28-12-2019T17:04:47,Greendyes,''cheatcodes unlocked'' gotta love it
28-12-2019T17:04:48,BluePhantom90,The cubs I doubt grown tigers
28-12-2019T17:05:01,Shierna,Behaviorists have shown that the earspots on tigers and other wildcats are actually to make social signals more visible.
28-12-2019T17:05:21,KeefMcDerpface,Hello everyone.
28-12-2019T17:05:25,BluePhantom90,hey there.
28-12-2019T17:05:26,MviluUatusun,Also smaller tigers will be attacked by larger ones.
28-12-2019T17:05:31,MviluUatusun,Howdy Keef.
28-12-2019T17:05:33,KeefMcDerpface,General Blue.

28-12-2019T17:10:42,ThingsAreMoving,I think I'm more interested in whether this is a tent or a building
28-12-2019T17:10:55,ThingsAreMoving,That looks like wooden flooring
28-12-2019T17:11:13,KeefMcDerpface,There's wood flooring so I'll say a building.
28-12-2019T17:11:16,MviluUatusun,"Looks that way to me, too, Things."
28-12-2019T17:11:36,ThingsAreMoving,"Which could mean Tigers aren't nomadic and live in buildings, so at least huts."
28-12-2019T17:12:12,KeefMcDerpface,Maybe some tribes are more civilize than others.

28-12-2019T17:13:16,BluePhantom90,they could be like Native American like
