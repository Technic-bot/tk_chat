12-04-2019T03:17:15,unsteddyphoenix,Their expressions can convey things instead of words ideally

12-04-2019T03:23:55,unsteddyphoenix,Or important character development

12-04-2019T14:01:15,BadFoMo,Yo.
12-04-2019T14:01:18,SageSaga,yo
12-04-2019T14:43:27,SageSaga,oh jeez
12-04-2019T14:44:07,SageSaga,"i just realized all the lights in my room are still off- i stretched and looked around my room and i was like ""Wow it's so dark for afternoon-"""
12-04-2019T15:14:06,Twokinds,I have Alexa turn my lights on automatically so I don't have to walk across the room and flip a switch.
12-04-2019T15:14:40,SageSaga,i dont have smart bulbs in all my lights to do that with Google Home
12-04-2019T15:14:59,Twokinds,"Oh, smart bulbs are so needlessly expensive"
12-04-2019T15:15:10,Twokinds,I use smart plugs
12-04-2019T15:15:25,SageSaga,you only have lamps then?
12-04-2019T15:15:28,Twokinds,More versitile and don't need to throw them away when the bulb dies
12-04-2019T15:15:52,Twokinds,"Yeah, just have the lamp plugged into the wifi plug."
12-04-2019T15:16:59,SageSaga,i have a ceiling light/fan
12-04-2019T15:17:18,Twokinds,Yeah I don't use my ceiling light as a result.
12-04-2019T15:18:08,SageSaga,i have one lamp but it cant light the entire room
12-04-2019T15:18:30,Twokinds,"But because the smart plug is attached to a power strip, I can have multiple things plugged in at once and set to a routine. My dream is to get electronic blinds and then have them open up in the morning, so I can pretend I'm Adam Jensen."
12-04-2019T15:19:03,SageSaga,XD
12-04-2019T15:19:24,SageSaga,life goals
12-04-2019T15:19:27,zolstarym,most electronic blinds cost like 400+
12-04-2019T15:19:40,CrimsonQuill,"Then you have me, scrunched over my table/bed with a pencil and paper, trying to get my light/lamp on the page."
12-04-2019T15:19:41,zolstarym,but I hear ikea are making cheaper ones
12-04-2019T15:20:23,iliar,It's funny. I think I love automation. I often write programs that do something useful for me. But I never made friends with smart lamps/plugs/switches.
12-04-2019T15:20:26,iliar,"It not looks useful on my opinion. Therefore, it seems to me strange that someone uses this."
12-04-2019T15:22:07,zolstarym,"The thing I like about my smart lights is that I can have them simulate a sunrise, so they gradually fade in and change to the appropriate color"
12-04-2019T15:22:21,zolstarym,makes it less jaring and easier to wake up in the morning
12-04-2019T15:23:17,SageSaga,my room is blacked out so nearly no light gets in from the outside
12-04-2019T15:23:31,zolstarym,"and I can have them red shift at night, because the brain's natural clock is sensitive to blue light, it can help get me to sleep faster"
12-04-2019T15:23:58,CrimsonQuill,"Oops, have to go to bed again. Almost 9:30 and TK reading time."
12-04-2019T15:24:00,CrimsonQuill,Night

12-04-2019T15:29:51,iliar,Simulate a sunrise is very cool function. Especially in winter when you need wake up early.
12-04-2019T15:31:30,iliar,But only smart lamps can do this. Not plugs and switches
12-04-2019T15:36:59,sunblaze,good evening fellas
12-04-2019T15:37:12,SageSaga,yo Sunblaze

12-04-2019T16:40:15,Mippy,Back to my non-dairy Ben & Jerry’s and the quest for pants
12-04-2019T16:43:15,Mippy,Lacto kids are so lucky these days...I wish I had so many options for non-dairy ice cream when I was a youngster
12-04-2019T16:45:06,Bgrmystr2,..or you could just not be lactose intolerant and still have the capability to enjoy all the same ones they do.
12-04-2019T16:45:27,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
12-04-2019T16:45:53,Mippy,Easier said than done. :ptv-confused:
12-04-2019T16:46:09,Bgrmystr2,"go back to the store, demand a refund"
12-04-2019T16:46:24,Bgrmystr2,your milk recievers are not functioning properly
12-04-2019T16:46:39,SageSaga,does the bone marrow trick work with lactose-intolerance?
12-04-2019T16:47:00,Mippy,:ptv-wondering:
12-04-2019T16:47:05,SageSaga,if it does i might need one
