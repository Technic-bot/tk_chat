14-03-2019T20:13:25,CrRAR,"lol, I literally just guessed my Kickstarter password from like 9 years ago."
14-03-2019T20:13:44,SageSaga,for those that read Yosh! how are y'all liking the current storyline?
14-03-2019T20:13:50,CrRAR,Pledgies comin your way soon!
14-03-2019T20:14:23,Rosscoe,For me sage its taking quite the turn in events.
14-03-2019T20:14:33,Mihari,"It's poopy, I want more pathfinder VR!"
14-03-2019T20:14:53,SageSaga,T_T
14-03-2019T20:15:00,Mihari,XD
14-03-2019T20:15:36,Rosscoe,uuuuuh
14-03-2019T20:15:42,Mihari,I'm the worst person to ask XD
14-03-2019T20:15:45,Nekonny,Its a large tail yeah
14-03-2019T20:15:57,Mihari,It's massive
14-03-2019T20:16:15,Mihari,Almost as big as her body
14-03-2019T20:16:39,CrRAR,big tail is directly proportional to CUTE
14-03-2019T20:16:45,Mihari,"No, it's not."
14-03-2019T20:16:48,CrRAR,:chart_with_upwards_trend:
14-03-2019T20:16:54,CrRAR,;_;
14-03-2019T20:16:57,MarvTheHugPharaoh,It just means there is more to hugs
14-03-2019T20:17:07,CrRAR,:D
14-03-2019T20:17:07,Nekonny,Hum
14-03-2019T20:17:17,Nekonny,it looked ok in the full size drawing
14-03-2019T20:17:22,Mihari,Cause then huge aracnid backsides would mean super cute
14-03-2019T20:17:27,Nekonny,I dod admit it looks a bit large here...
14-03-2019T20:17:34,MarvTheHugPharaoh,it could be
14-03-2019T20:17:43,CrRAR,lol
14-03-2019T20:17:45,Mihari,So by that logic I have to disagree to that direct relation.
14-03-2019T20:17:46,Rosscoe,it looks large cause her legs are missing
14-03-2019T20:17:55,Mihari,No it looks large because it is large.
14-03-2019T20:18:13,CrRAR,bu- but that is a thorax
14-03-2019T20:18:15,Mihari,Tails should very rarely be larger than a thigh XD
14-03-2019T20:18:36,Mihari,Connected to tail bone proportionally! XD
14-03-2019T20:18:45,SageSaga,that ones larger than her shoulders without the pads
14-03-2019T20:18:45,Bgrmystr2,Bah. Big floofy tails are the best
14-03-2019T20:18:48,Rosscoe,Course shes a fox person with fluffy tail and the floof really is the size of her main body
14-03-2019T20:19:17,Mihari,She better pray that never gets wet or she's gonna be immoble
14-03-2019T20:19:53,Rosscoe,Its gota be hair spray
14-03-2019T20:20:07,Mihari,That's... not how hair spray works.
14-03-2019T20:21:09,Rosscoe,"Your right,"
14-03-2019T20:21:31,Rosscoe,Its gota be conditiioner.
14-03-2019T20:21:35,Rosscoe,to add volume
14-03-2019T20:21:55,Mihari,¬_¬

14-03-2019T20:31:40,AFallingTree,you can snap 3 things just no side by side
14-03-2019T20:31:48,SageSaga,Tom- Mihari and I use a program for that
14-03-2019T20:31:56,Twokinds,As far as I can tell you can do 2 or 4 in a grid
14-03-2019T20:32:08,Twokinds,But I could really use just 1-1-1
14-03-2019T20:32:10,qwe304,whys the timer going?
14-03-2019T20:32:10,CrRAR,"Yeah, that seems true"

14-03-2019T20:32:22,Bgrmystr2,"There's a whole lot of backstory to Mardi Gras, but most people just participate in the celebration rather than worry about why it's a thing."
14-03-2019T20:32:28,BadFoMo,Timer?
14-03-2019T20:32:32,Twokinds,Oh that's just left over.

14-03-2019T22:03:51,Bgrmystr2,and stuff before that was also pretty good

14-03-2019T22:08:42,Ordithus,I see
14-03-2019T22:08:55,Bgrmystr2,but the SNES was coming soon and they decided to port it over if I recall correctly
14-03-2019T22:09:11,MrRetroRealm,I believe that's how it went
14-03-2019T22:09:27,Ordithus,"I was pretty oblivious to the actual consoles then, the neighbors had that"

14-03-2019T22:41:33,Rosscoe,I know I m just being silly
14-03-2019T22:41:38,Rosscoe,hmmm
14-03-2019T22:41:53,Rosscoe,"oh wait, what about that robot girl from Mischeif makers?"

14-03-2019T22:42:03,Rosscoe,Maria that was her name
14-03-2019T22:42:26,Mihari,I have no idea what you just asked.
14-03-2019T22:42:40,SageSaga,he means the katboxad URL
14-03-2019T22:42:45,Lukewci25,Yup
14-03-2019T22:42:55,Mihari,"They aren't, it's a mirror."

14-03-2019T22:43:32,Bgrmystr2,aren't all the comics working for their normal URLs?
14-03-2019T22:43:34,Bgrmystr2,or most anyway?

14-03-2019T22:43:50,Rosscoe,The site is still abit of a mess
14-03-2019T22:43:54,Mihari,The real question is why haven't all the artists gotten their stuff together to get their sites up on the real domains since all the imports were done.
14-03-2019T22:43:57,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-NoraEyebrows:
14-03-2019T22:44:02,Bgrmystr2,you can just remove the ad from the url and get the new page
14-03-2019T22:44:12,Bgrmystr2,I know Ron only has one of his comics there lol.
14-03-2019T22:44:15,Nekonny,\o/
14-03-2019T22:44:22,Nekonny,You know my reason
14-03-2019T22:44:31,Mihari,All of Ron's comics are there
14-03-2019T22:44:40,Nekonny,but they are hidden
14-03-2019T22:44:43,SageSaga,all of mine are on the new site too

14-03-2019T23:01:04,DracoItkovitz,Hi kiwiThunder
14-03-2019T23:01:11,MrRetroRealm,I've been trying to make a comic since middle school XD I still haven't even got past the concept phase
14-03-2019T23:01:14,FloofyCat,"To be fair, Tom has had 16 years to get this good"
14-03-2019T23:01:20,NezumiYuki,"If not for photoshop brushes, forget making trees... like NOPE!"
14-03-2019T23:01:54,MrRetroRealm,Whenever I try to draw a background I wanna cry at times. I don't even know how anyone can be this patient
14-03-2019T23:02:09,DracoItkovitz,Umm retro

14-03-2019T23:03:41,MrRetroRealm,???
14-03-2019T23:03:49,DracoItkovitz,Oh btw hi Tom
14-03-2019T23:03:54,Ordithus,"In stream A, we have a cute robot girl.  In stream B, we have a hot fuzzy boy.  What a time to be alive"
14-03-2019T23:04:00,NezumiYuki,Sythe attempts to draw the others in SAI....   Hilarity ensues?
14-03-2019T23:04:02,CrRAR,Haha
14-03-2019T23:04:28,DracoItkovitz,Wolfstar vibe for me though 😘
14-03-2019T23:04:49,MrRetroRealm,"Ugh, I still need to read more of Twokinds"
14-03-2019T23:04:58,MrRetroRealm,I went through the first chapter
14-03-2019T23:05:06,DracoItkovitz,Feels like kabier though with his lower half
14-03-2019T23:05:09,CrRAR,Gogogo
14-03-2019T23:05:20,Twokinds,I'm trying not to make his muscles too defined. I've always thought that looks weird when combined with fur.
14-03-2019T23:05:29,CrRAR,Tru
14-03-2019T23:05:33,DracoItkovitz,It’s fine
14-03-2019T23:05:40,MrRetroRealm,"Ah, you have a good thought process"
14-03-2019T23:05:50,NezumiYuki,"Looks like a nicely built boi, Tom!"
14-03-2019T23:05:52,DracoItkovitz,He’s poofy
14-03-2019T23:06:03,MrRetroRealm,I drew a guy who is RIPPED lol
14-03-2019T23:06:11,DracoItkovitz,Like manny always says
14-03-2019T23:06:13,SageSaga,Tom - want to see some muscular animals?
14-03-2019T23:06:14,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-maddiessparkles:
14-03-2019T23:06:24,CrRAR,Lol
14-03-2019T23:06:26,Twokinds,...Not really
14-03-2019T23:06:34,CrRAR,Lolo
14-03-2019T23:06:45,FloofyCat,I got a pic of a buff cat.
14-03-2019T23:06:45,MarvTheHugPharaoh,lol
14-03-2019T23:06:48,SageSaga,China genetically engineered some Beagle dogs to be very muscular
14-03-2019T23:07:03,Ordithus,:ptv-confused:
14-03-2019T23:07:04,FloofyCat,Wallabies can get quite ripped
14-03-2019T23:07:06,CrRAR,A muscular elephant would be something to see
14-03-2019T23:07:08,MrRetroRealm,Maybe after I read more of Twokinds I might sketch some of his anthros meeting some of mine to see what differences they have
14-03-2019T23:07:10,DracoItkovitz,Last time someone asked if they wanted to see muscular animals I called the cops lol
14-03-2019T23:07:12,NezumiYuki,"Why of all things, a buffed beagle?"
14-03-2019T23:07:41,FloofyCat,Yeah I also wonder why a buff beagle
14-03-2019T23:07:42,SageSaga,because they were genetically very close to another dog known for large muscles of course
14-03-2019T23:07:46,Twokinds,I'm not saying it can't be done well
14-03-2019T23:07:57,DracoItkovitz,It’s fine Tom
14-03-2019T23:08:12,Twokinds,"I'm just saying it's something you have to be careful about. If you start giving hard lines to too many abs, it starts looking like it's painted on."

14-03-2019T23:08:42,NezumiYuki,LOL fake abbs!  xD

14-03-2019T23:12:37,DracoItkovitz,Tom I notice he has a curve to his lower right of his stumach
14-03-2019T23:12:52,NezumiYuki,Oh dang... Armstrong THICC keidrans?  :D

14-03-2019T23:24:27,SpazztasticKiwi,People fresh out of high school and into their 90s alike go to college
14-03-2019T23:24:34,DracoItkovitz,With glasses shirt tucked into jeans and one shoulder strap backpack
14-03-2019T23:24:37,Dadrobit,Depends on what year they're in. Freshmen are usually quite bright eyed and bushy tailed.
14-03-2019T23:24:50,Ordithus,"Kat is both of these, yes"
14-03-2019T23:24:52,Twokinds,I went to college but I never interacted with anyone
14-03-2019T23:24:53,CrRAR,Well Kat is a prime candidate then
14-03-2019T23:24:58,Dadrobit,"Also, didn't you go to college, Tom? Like at least for a day?"
14-03-2019T23:25:02,CrRAR,\o/
14-03-2019T23:25:02,Dadrobit,"Ah, there it is."
14-03-2019T23:25:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Why am I not shocked at that Tom
14-03-2019T23:25:05,FloofyCat,"I dunno about American universities but mine in the UK is just very generic clothing, backpacks etc."
14-03-2019T23:25:17,CrRAR,That is a familiar experience
14-03-2019T23:25:18,DracoItkovitz,Santa Clara college has the stereotypical college kids
14-03-2019T23:25:28,Twokinds,I just went to my 2 classes each week and then went home.
14-03-2019T23:25:44,Ordithus,"Ah, you were a commuting student"

14-03-2019T23:26:02,Twokinds,I always had 2 3-hour classes each week.
14-03-2019T23:26:04,DracoItkovitz,Same lol
14-03-2019T23:26:17,Ordithus,I specifically went to a college just far enough away that wasn't an option
14-03-2019T23:26:22,DracoItkovitz,I took 3-5 hours
14-03-2019T23:26:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Think you’ll go back?
14-03-2019T23:26:25,Twokinds,And that's all I did. XD Most of them were at night too so the place was mostly empty.
14-03-2019T23:26:34,Dadrobit,Night classes are baller.
14-03-2019T23:26:36,Ordithus,Night classes were fun

14-03-2019T23:27:16,DracoItkovitz,Anyone have any Saturday parties
14-03-2019T23:27:21,BluePhantom90,did they get forced out or something

14-03-2019T23:28:40,DracoItkovitz,I took animation 3 then work
14-03-2019T23:28:48,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s why I started at ICC

14-03-2019T23:29:34,SpazztasticKiwi,But as for anything else I can see Cincin if I ever could

14-03-2019T23:29:54,Ordithus,So many late nights working on our racecar while doing homework...

14-03-2019T23:31:51,Ordithus,"Kat is double fisting the coffee, must be exams"

14-03-2019T23:32:05,CrRAR,2nd one might be phone
14-03-2019T23:32:08,Bgrmystr2,a few restraunt visits won't cost that much

14-03-2019T23:34:23,Bgrmystr2,Cr with the stream-relevant emoji
14-03-2019T23:34:24,Ordithus,I wonder what Kat would major in

14-03-2019T23:38:37,CrRAR,lol
14-03-2019T23:38:40,Mihari,Okay almost any outfit...
14-03-2019T23:38:44,KiTA,But that page of Magical Mishaps has me wondering if there's some reason Kat likes to go Furclad
14-03-2019T23:38:56,Ordithus,Tom drew ya wearing a bit more than a bikini
14-03-2019T23:38:57,NezumiYuki,"But Speed Kitty dear, you look great in tribal bikinis!"
14-03-2019T23:39:10,DracoItkovitz,Hey tom you know about the bird scooters right
14-03-2019T23:39:11,KiTA,Like was she punished if she didn't and got a complex?  Or is that part of her breeding?
14-03-2019T23:39:12,Mihari,Tom is the exceptions.
14-03-2019T23:39:16,Ordithus,haha
14-03-2019T23:39:19,KiTA,My drama senses went off when I saw that pregnant pause
14-03-2019T23:39:25,KiTA,But I'm probably wrong haha
14-03-2019T23:39:35,DracoItkovitz,No wrong
14-03-2019T23:39:45,DracoItkovitz,That’s a laptop case
14-03-2019T23:39:50,FloofyCat,"Probably no clothes for slaves, I guess that's why Flora is the same. I dunno though, lots of cool backstory I'm hoping Tom taps into more"
14-03-2019T23:40:17,Mihari,The no clothes probably stems to the fact they are uncomfortable and unnessicary cause... fur.
14-03-2019T23:40:19,DracoItkovitz,You know about bird scooters right tom?
14-03-2019T23:40:26,KiTA,"Well, she's worn clothes before in comic, but she went back to furclad.  Someone mentioned she started dressing when Keenspace started cracking down on furry nudity and stopped when they stopped"
14-03-2019T23:40:26,Ordithus,"Keidran in general often go in just fur, the cast being exceptions since most of them are around humans so much"
14-03-2019T23:40:32,NezumiYuki,^ Agreement with Mihari

14-03-2019T23:41:08,FloofyCat,"True, I guess that's a reasonable explanation"
14-03-2019T23:41:09,Mihari,Felines and Canines especially would probably get very hot given their limited places to sweat XD
14-03-2019T23:41:28,NezumiYuki,^ all the unfortunate panting
14-03-2019T23:41:39,Ordithus,"Natani wears clothing for obvious reasons, and Zen because he seems to imagine he's sytlish"
14-03-2019T23:42:03,KiTA,"Yeah, it's the others that dress, along with that pregnant pause during the bonus comic that got me"
14-03-2019T23:42:06,FloofyCat,"Well, technically they can't sweat, but that'd mean they'd lose that Human-Keidran war from heat strokes pretty fast. So I'd imagine Keidran can sweat, I think nearly all if not all furred animals can't sweat, I dunno"
14-03-2019T23:42:14,KiTA,"Just screamed ""foreshadowing"""

14-03-2019T23:46:28,FloofyCat,I mean ones for all the characters.
14-03-2019T23:46:33,Ordithus,That was more of a side story
14-03-2019T23:46:36,DracoItkovitz,No
14-03-2019T23:46:49,KiTA,"Basically, a Werewolf becomming her daughter's imaginary friend.  XD"
14-03-2019T23:46:56,DracoItkovitz,Wtf
14-03-2019T23:47:13,FloofyCat,"Awwhh, I hope we get some for Kat, Sythe, Maren, Raine etc"

14-03-2019T23:47:57,CrRAR,Tdm spun out of a kickstarter reward to provide a few character backstories.  The effort got combined into what became TDM.

14-03-2019T23:50:00,FloofyCat,I'd probably donate to a kickstarter or something else if we could get something like TDM for other characters
