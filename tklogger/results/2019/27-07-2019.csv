27-07-2019T00:10:02,SpazztasticKiwi,practicing this calligraphy mess and I just spent ten minutes debating how to spell Toms last name
27-07-2019T00:10:22,Bgrmystr2,fhschbffrk.
27-07-2019T00:10:28,SpazztasticKiwi,exactly
27-07-2019T00:10:30,Bgrmystr2,nailed it. :ptv-SteelwormHades:
27-07-2019T00:10:45,SpazztasticKiwi,my brain was just like ‚Äúis it even real‚Äù
27-07-2019T00:11:01,AspiringNoodle,Haha
27-07-2019T00:11:08,AspiringNoodle,"Also, my outrage was apparently misplaced"
27-07-2019T00:11:26,SpazztasticKiwi,I hate doin s‚Äôs and he‚Äôs got three of the things
27-07-2019T00:11:36,SpazztasticKiwi,just
27-07-2019T00:12:01,SpazztasticKiwi,the concentration on each letter as you do it so the lines are right
27-07-2019T00:12:17,AspiringNoodle,I didn't know people did calligraphy with western languages
27-07-2019T00:12:22,SpazztasticKiwi,not a fan of how the Fs are done but oh well
27-07-2019T00:12:36,AspiringNoodle,Sounds about as much fun as doing it the traditional way :D
27-07-2019T00:12:49,SpazztasticKiwi,well it‚Äôs called ‚Äúfeathiligraphy‚Äù
27-07-2019T00:12:55,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs a feathery form
27-07-2019T00:13:05,AspiringNoodle,feathiligraphy
27-07-2019T00:13:07,AspiringNoodle,feathery
27-07-2019T00:13:08,AspiringNoodle,feather
27-07-2019T00:13:14,AspiringNoodle,BIRB KEIDRAN CONFIRMED
27-07-2019T00:13:23,Bgrmystr2,fllffhgghfurffly.
27-07-2019T00:13:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve done other names but not Fischsbasch
27-07-2019T00:13:26,Bgrmystr2,did I get it right?
27-07-2019T00:13:55,SpazztasticKiwi,if you think spelling it‚Äôs hard try saying it right on the first try without tripping over yourself
27-07-2019T00:14:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I do have an example of it from Sander‚Äôs practice sheet
27-07-2019T00:14:35,SpazztasticKiwi,He‚Äôs got an F in his name
27-07-2019T00:14:42,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno, I can pronounce it fine lol"

27-07-2019T00:15:14,SpazztasticKiwi,obviously not done
27-07-2019T00:15:55,SpazztasticKiwi,"along with that I have Ethan, Se√°n, Malcolm, Mandy & Amy"
27-07-2019T00:16:08,SpazztasticKiwi,all in states of doneness
27-07-2019T00:16:58,SpazztasticKiwi,I figured today why not drive myself to pure insanity and try Fischbahumbug‚Äôs last name
27-07-2019T00:17:25,AspiringNoodle,"Ah yes, you know the frustration of trying to do the impossible"
27-07-2019T00:29:53,SpazztasticKiwi,the more you look at it the less sense it makes
27-07-2019T00:30:04,SpazztasticKiwi,no name should have that many extra letters
27-07-2019T00:31:33,AspiringNoodle,As someone whose first and last name has a combined 14 letters.  Eff long names
27-07-2019T00:31:41,AspiringNoodle,And that's not even counting my middle name
27-07-2019T00:32:00,Sclimshady,"If it makes you feel better, half the letters in my name aren't pronounced the way they seem.  I have to live like this.  My pasport was even spelled incorrectly"
27-07-2019T00:32:25,AspiringNoodle,"Also, my name is so effing common it took me forever to make a ""professional"" email for job applications"
27-07-2019T00:33:15,Sclimshady,Literally no one im not related to has my name
27-07-2019T00:33:29,AspiringNoodle,I share the same first/last name combo with 534 other people
27-07-2019T00:34:08,AspiringNoodle,What makes it even more awkward is that one of those people is an artist xD
27-07-2019T00:34:52,AspiringNoodle,"Well, I'm gonna call it a night.  I wonder how much it would cost to change my name..."
27-07-2019T00:35:03,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-sleepy:
27-07-2019T00:35:16,Sclimshady,Night noodle
27-07-2019T00:37:58,SpazztasticKiwi,my first name is mega common
27-07-2019T00:38:38,SpazztasticKiwi,not as dear God where did they all come from as it used to but there‚Äôs 3 ways to do it
27-07-2019T00:39:11,SpazztasticKiwi,I went to school with a girl the same spelling and even her last name started the same
27-07-2019T00:39:28,SpazztasticKiwi,and there was a third girl whose first name was my last
27-07-2019T00:40:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I now work with a guy who goes by his middle name which is my last name
27-07-2019T00:40:04,SpazztasticKiwi,fun
27-07-2019T00:40:16,Sclimshady,"This sounds very complicated, even when mispronounced i can tell if its my name or not"
27-07-2019T00:41:22,SpazztasticKiwi,as difficult as it is to pronounce my first or last name it happened
27-07-2019T00:41:57,SpazztasticKiwi,if I had a dollar for everytime they saw n‚Äôs for the r‚Äôs
27-07-2019T00:44:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I imagine every time Tom heard a teacher say ‚ÄúJason Fffff....‚Äù
27-07-2019T00:44:27,SpazztasticKiwi,he just said ‚Äúhere‚Äù
27-07-2019T00:51:44,Bgrmystr2,kiwi's name is bob confirmt
27-07-2019T01:03:19,SpazztasticKiwi,NO ITS BOBERT FOR THE LOVE OF GOD
27-07-2019T01:16:04,Bgrmystr2,"OH, sorry, I was close."
27-07-2019T01:42:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Marks having a fit how this game put him in as a character and he never knew. Though I wonder if he‚Äôs more irritated at that or the fact they made him a pink tiger in a weeabo dating game
27-07-2019T01:45:01,SpazztasticKiwi,the only thing I really want to know is if they happened to make him the tiger at the end or planned it in any way cause of Flora - as a reference to Tom
27-07-2019T01:46:32,SpazztasticKiwi,not to mention his is the only character that refrences NSFW fanart with animal characteristics (ears)

27-07-2019T13:04:16,IronHorseComics,reminds me of when I used colored pencil
27-07-2019T13:04:38,CrimsonQuill,@IronHorseComics This was actually a revision of the piece
27-07-2019T13:04:44,CrimsonQuill,The first one was rushed
27-07-2019T13:04:54,CrimsonQuill,So I spent the next week redrawing it
27-07-2019T13:05:19,CrimsonQuill,"And decided to put Raine in because, Halo, and I thought it'd be nice for Tom when he came back from SDCC"

27-07-2019T14:36:27,SpazztasticKiwi,how spicy is kimchi
27-07-2019T14:42:39,Twokinds,Depends on what you mean by spicy. Kimchi is like... all spice. It's covered in red pepper and stuff. But is it hot? I've never considered it hot.
27-07-2019T14:42:57,RimaDraws,according to google on one source its a bit spicy with the peppers
27-07-2019T14:43:18,Bgrmystr2,Mornin all

27-07-2019T14:44:28,iliar,My mom calls any food that have any tastes as ‚Äúspicy‚Äù
27-07-2019T14:44:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I was wondering cause they got new shipment of it

27-07-2019T14:45:05,SpazztasticKiwi,but now it‚Äôs labeled ‚Äúspicy‚Äù
27-07-2019T14:45:38,SpazztasticKiwi,I saw a video where a lady cooked some homemade with her grandson and it didn‚Äôt seem they put too much spice in it
27-07-2019T14:45:44,RimaDraws,i want to try that now
27-07-2019T14:45:56,iliar,"Olives are ""spicy"". Basil is ""spicy"". Sesame oil is ""spicy""."
27-07-2019T14:45:57,Twokinds,I don't consider it spicy. But it is very flavorful.
27-07-2019T14:46:49,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôd might consider getting some if it wasn‚Äôt a big jar
27-07-2019T14:46:55,SpazztasticKiwi,and I had something to go with
27-07-2019T14:47:58,RimaDraws,ive been meanin to try korean dishes

27-07-2019T14:50:42,iliar,Speaking of food. I heard that Americans really like spicy food. Do you think this is true? Or is it just a stereo?
27-07-2019T14:50:44,NextGenAnubisKid,Nice
27-07-2019T14:50:57,NextGenAnubisKid,"Hmmmm, I'd say it varies from person to person"
27-07-2019T14:50:58,SpazztasticKiwi,some Americans do
27-07-2019T14:51:22,NextGenAnubisKid,I know plenty of folks adore spicy food. I have a ridiculously low spice tolerance so I'm not the biggest fan myself XD
27-07-2019T14:51:32,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt personally like the nausea that it brings
27-07-2019T14:51:36,NextGenAnubisKid,But I am working on building it up so I can expand my palette.
27-07-2019T14:51:43,NextGenAnubisKid,Well I don't like spice for the sake of spice.
27-07-2019T14:52:10,NextGenAnubisKid,"I like spice when it adds flavor and a little kick, if that makes sense."

27-07-2019T16:03:56,FloofyCat,I wonder if Keidran are naturally stronger than humans too. Humans having much more type 1 muscle fibres compared to most other animals having type 2a and 2b and all.
27-07-2019T16:04:12,kts,hello everyone ^^
27-07-2019T16:04:19,NextGenAnubisKid,I see the cape has a little pouch on it. Stylish and useful ^^

27-07-2019T16:05:43,PalmettoPathfinder1,Tigress: The reason we don't go to Raven's Home is because the Ravens are a bunch of stuck up jerks.

27-07-2019T16:36:22,NextGenAnubisKid,"@Nerooooh IIRC there haven't been any avian Keidran in the comic proper, but Tom did sketch one out one time."
27-07-2019T16:36:26,Nerooooh,for bob ross to like it
27-07-2019T16:36:59,McClaw,"Nero -- wat about the pines on the left, or the trunk in front of them?"

27-07-2019T16:37:10,Mippy,Oh yeah....that ‚Äúbirb‚Äù suggestion. That turned out awesome

27-07-2019T16:38:47,Ordithus,Hi Lann!
27-07-2019T16:38:49,LannAF,This picture makes me think of all the dumb construction poses the photographers make us do xD

27-07-2019T16:40:27,Mippy,Hi Purp
27-07-2019T16:40:41,McClaw,"Lann, that sounds like a photographer who doesn't actually understand the subject."
27-07-2019T16:40:56,Nerooooh,probably hehe
27-07-2019T16:41:34,Orthonox,@Nerooooh No canonical Avian Keidran. Keidran are stuck to canines and felines.
27-07-2019T16:41:51,Nerooooh,ahh okay
27-07-2019T16:41:55,McClaw,"With foxes standing in for ""both"". :P"
27-07-2019T16:42:32,Nerooooh,there are the bushes

27-07-2019T16:44:17,McClaw,"Tigress: ""And these are the snu-snu bushes. Don't expect to keep your pants there."" :P"
27-07-2019T16:44:24,LannAF,"hi purple! Hi Sclim, Anubis!"
27-07-2019T16:44:39,LannAF,"no, it is McClaw"
27-07-2019T16:44:43,PurpleLemons,ay Lann o/
27-07-2019T16:44:54,LannAF,actual construction is usually just a lot less glamorous
27-07-2019T16:45:03,LannAF,and nobody wants to see that lol
27-07-2019T16:45:56,w0lfmare,Hey Lann
27-07-2019T16:46:03,Sclimshady,Someone yelling because their lumbar got ranover with a forklift would be a better construction pic

27-07-2019T16:51:20,Nerooooh,pillows*
27-07-2019T16:51:38,McClaw,"Nero, the common term is ""body pillow""."
27-07-2019T16:51:44,BowlOfSomething,Not replacing my Flora background
27-07-2019T16:51:51,Mippy,Not that I know of Claw
27-07-2019T16:52:07,Nerooooh,i want one of those body pollows***
27-07-2019T16:52:13,Nerooooh,thx mcclaw
27-07-2019T16:52:26,LannAF,w00lf
27-07-2019T16:52:27,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"legit, body pillows look comfy"
27-07-2019T16:52:31,BadFoMo,Yo.
27-07-2019T16:52:36,RimaDraws,oooh lookin good
27-07-2019T16:52:36,Bgrmystr2,"their name is dakimakura, or daki for short. :)"
27-07-2019T16:52:43,Ordithus,"He's drawn 3, not sold them though.  Flora, Kat, Adira."
27-07-2019T16:52:45,Nerooooh,something to hug would be nice
27-07-2019T16:52:54,Ordithus,Kat's would need some weird triangle pillow
27-07-2019T16:53:10,Nerooooh,thx @bgrmystr2
27-07-2019T16:53:16,Bgrmystr2,"If it's blue, it'd be trace."
27-07-2019T16:53:19,Bgrmystr2,He'd never see it though.
27-07-2019T16:53:26,Ordithus,pfft
27-07-2019T16:53:27,Bgrmystr2,Trace's*
27-07-2019T16:53:38,McClaw,Body pillows aren't usually very decorative. Dakis usually are (mostly with pictures).
27-07-2019T16:53:57,Nerooooh,ohhhh
27-07-2019T16:53:59,Bgrmystr2,yeah dakimakura describes the body pillow with images on it
27-07-2019T16:54:12,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"I don't need a picture on one, I just want some comfort"
27-07-2019T16:54:13,Bgrmystr2,"technically, the covering, but yknow."
27-07-2019T16:54:18,Mippy,Dakis are pillowcases for body pillows or something
27-07-2019T16:54:20,McClaw,"There are places that will make a custom daki (just the cover) for you, if you can privide the image(s) in proper size and format."
27-07-2019T16:54:21,Bgrmystr2,otherwise it's just an ordinary pillow
27-07-2019T16:54:38,Bgrmystr2,"yeah lots of places do that, McClaw"
27-07-2019T16:54:50,McClaw,You can also use a daki by stuffing it with two or more regular pillows.
27-07-2019T16:55:19,Bgrmystr2,you need two pillows half the size though
27-07-2019T16:55:28,Bgrmystr2,not just any size works
27-07-2019T16:55:41,Nerooooh,macgyver that sjit haha
27-07-2019T16:55:50,LoneWolfZitsue,Has Tom done a fury self of himself yet??
27-07-2019T16:55:55,Nerooooh,of it works it works
27-07-2019T16:56:22,Mippy,Tom is usually human...except when he‚Äôs a roomba
27-07-2019T16:56:23,McClaw,"I don't think Tom's posted ""daki art"" pics are large enough to make a custom daki, though."
27-07-2019T16:56:30,BadFoMo,@LoneWolfZitsue I think he did years ago.
27-07-2019T16:56:45,Nerooooh,we should put that up for a fote
27-07-2019T16:56:47,LoneWolfZitsue,We should get him to do oneüòÇ
27-07-2019T16:56:50,Nerooooh,vote*
27-07-2019T16:56:53,LoneWolfZitsue,Yea!!
27-07-2019T16:57:05,Nerooooh,tom?
27-07-2019T16:57:07,Ordithus,I expect the resolution of printing a pillowcase is pretty low.  They'd probably be fine
27-07-2019T16:57:14,Nerooooh,i so hope he reads this haha
27-07-2019T16:57:28,Bgrmystr2,"not really, ord"
27-07-2019T16:57:40,Ordithus,I guess I wouldn't really know
27-07-2019T16:57:42,Nerooooh,*feels ashamed for his fans haha*
27-07-2019T16:57:48,Bgrmystr2,usually you print them at like 6k or 8k in one direction
27-07-2019T16:57:50,Bgrmystr2,due to the length
27-07-2019T16:58:00,Bgrmystr2,to have a clear picture
27-07-2019T16:58:04,Bgrmystr2,otherwise it's pixelated
27-07-2019T16:58:13,Ordithus,"""Adira, what lovely pixels you have my dear <3 """
27-07-2019T16:58:29,Mippy,How do you know Ord is not into pixels?
27-07-2019T16:58:35,RimaDraws,pfft
27-07-2019T16:58:39,McClaw,"The ratio for one side is 1:3, but between measurements and dpi it's going to be pretty big."
27-07-2019T16:58:39,Ordithus,:ptv-uneasy:
27-07-2019T16:58:57,Bgrmystr2,"If he was into pixels, he wouldn't be worried about getting sonething that's not made of pixels :P"
27-07-2019T16:59:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Tom, how do you do landscapes so well!"
27-07-2019T16:59:38,McClaw,"A quick search gives this: ""6000x2100 or Higher"""

27-07-2019T17:00:41,McClaw,"Oooh, shafts of sunlight. That's a *very* nice valley."

27-07-2019T17:03:50,RedDragonSyndicate,how's everyone doing?
27-07-2019T17:03:51,PalmettoPathfinder1,"You know I had a vision of Flora being told by Bender from Futurama to bite his shiny metal butt and she replies, ""I wouldn't bite that poor excuse of a butt of yours even if my fangs could rip apart steel."" This causes Bender to cry."
27-07-2019T17:04:00,PalmettoPathfinder1,Doing good.  Just binge watching Futurama.
27-07-2019T17:04:10,PalmettoPathfinder1,And watching Tom draw and color.
27-07-2019T17:04:13,FoxxTrotter,"Things are fine here. The 90-degree weather has returned, though. XP"
27-07-2019T17:04:20,PalmettoPathfinder1,NO!
27-07-2019T17:04:26,NextGenAnubisKid,Am doing well! Just got some laundry going and finished up my first sketch in two weeks XD
27-07-2019T17:04:29,PalmettoPathfinder1,Not the 90 degree weather!
27-07-2019T17:04:44,NextGenAnubisKid,Just a simple glass of water. Gotta start somewhere lol.
27-07-2019T17:04:48,Nerooooh,im so happy it cooled down here
27-07-2019T17:04:56,FoxxTrotter,"Yeah, it was in the 80's all of last week. Back to summertime again."
27-07-2019T17:05:04,Nerooooh,41C was to much for me
27-07-2019T17:05:07,RedDragonSyndicate,Yeah it's around 108 here
27-07-2019T17:05:11,RedDragonSyndicate,our cat is melting
27-07-2019T17:05:16,NextGenAnubisKid,"Cripes, stay cool Red!"
27-07-2019T17:05:24,Mippy,I‚Äôve got a comfortable 22
27-07-2019T17:05:28,AspiringNoodle,"For me, 90F and lower is comfortable"
27-07-2019T17:05:30,PalmettoPathfinder1,We hardly had a winter and spring.  Seems that the weather just jumped from Autumn straight to Summer.
27-07-2019T17:05:39,AspiringNoodle,Maybe 95F.  But above that I give heat the finger
27-07-2019T17:05:54,Ordithus,71 F and rainy :ctwokinds-daydreamingkat:
27-07-2019T17:06:01,Nerooooh,it also depends on the climate
27-07-2019T17:06:04,AspiringNoodle,"Ord, don't make me hurt you -3-"
27-07-2019T17:06:11,PalmettoPathfinder1,Glares at Ordithus.  Send that rain to us please!
27-07-2019T17:06:11,Corinthian,I wish it was 75 F with a gentle breeze.
27-07-2019T17:06:12,FoxxTrotter,No rain here in the past week.
27-07-2019T17:06:15,Sclimshady,That sounds nice ord :weary:
27-07-2019T17:06:17,NextGenAnubisKid,Ord you lucky son of a gun XD
27-07-2019T17:06:33,Xexanoth,"well i have some bad news guys, the adira daki is not in a high enough resolution for an actual body pillow...."
27-07-2019T17:06:35,KaiElanzo,This one keeps reminding me of a painting of Louis & Clark with Sacagawea  https://fineartamerica.com/featured/lewis-and-clark-1805-granger.html
27-07-2019T17:06:57,Twok,"Well midle Europe has 33C,not bad (i prefer around 25C)"
27-07-2019T17:07:01,Ordithus,Makes the lack of spring worth it
27-07-2019T17:07:09,NextGenAnubisKid,81 Fahrenheit (27 C) and sunny where I'm at
27-07-2019T17:07:12,Xexanoth,we've had low 20C and rain the last to days
27-07-2019T17:07:16,Xexanoth,which was really nice
27-07-2019T17:07:27,Xexanoth,because it's been 30-40C and no rain the last two weeks
27-07-2019T17:07:27,NextGenAnubisKid,That does sound nice Xex ^^
27-07-2019T17:07:30,Nerooooh,its 60F here right now (12 at night haha)
27-07-2019T17:07:38,McClaw,"Hmm, do the tigers have hot springs? :P"
27-07-2019T17:07:43,NextGenAnubisKid,Lucky Nero XD
27-07-2019T17:07:51,Nerooooh,xexa we had that to
27-07-2019T17:08:08,Nerooooh,broke our heat record last week

27-07-2019T17:08:49,Nerooooh,that works too
27-07-2019T17:09:11,Mippy,Has been laying on new pillow. Pretty good for a dollar store pillow. I only payed $4 each
27-07-2019T17:09:18,Nerooooh,you live in western europe?

27-07-2019T17:11:04,Nerooooh,shadow*
27-07-2019T17:11:21,McClaw,"Or maybe if this is actually a hot climate, they have ""cool springs"" (probably in underground grottos)?"
27-07-2019T17:11:32,Mippy,Think I need a quick snack
27-07-2019T17:11:42,CrRAR,gogogo
27-07-2019T17:12:53,Nerooooh,food is also good
27-07-2019T17:13:16,Mippy,"Grabbed some of the banana, nut, and chocolate loaf I made last night"

27-07-2019T17:14:49,Nerooooh,that sounds like a weird combo

27-07-2019T17:32:48,BadFoMo,@AspiringNoodle In what way?
27-07-2019T17:32:56,McClaw,Interesting. The blue glowing stones can actually illuminate things.
27-07-2019T17:33:12,AspiringNoodle,First guess: Give them an impromptu cold shower :ptv-snicker:
27-07-2019T17:33:46,Nerooooh,or burn their perverted thoughts out with fire

27-07-2019T17:34:56,TeapotOfDoom,Is chat laggy or has the stream way less lag then normal for me

27-07-2019T17:36:12,Nerooooh,same for me
27-07-2019T17:36:42,TeapotOfDoom,"I conclude: stream delay normal, chat is laggy. Although better then before with the crapy cell reception"
27-07-2019T17:37:14,TeapotOfDoom,Probably because of the less then optimal wifi
27-07-2019T17:37:15,Naberthot,I know this is random but I just realized August 9th is a Friday... I need to catch that stream for my Birthday ^w^

27-07-2019T17:50:09,NezumiYuki,"Secondly, Sage, Tom, if I may, I'd like to link a gift image from dA?  :D"
27-07-2019T17:50:18,HeresyArtStream,Happy birthday Tom! :birthday:
27-07-2019T17:50:34,TeapotOfDoom,Yeah i know. Spent ~12 hours in the car today as well. It's so exkausting

27-07-2019T17:50:57,Glassan,"hallo, Heresy"
27-07-2019T17:51:01,BadFoMo,Yo.
27-07-2019T17:51:28,TeapotOfDoom,I'm basically alergic to air by now

27-07-2019T17:58:19,NezumiYuki,"Kathrin of blue water, I see.  xD"

27-07-2019T18:01:33,Dadrobit,"Back again, finally made it to the second one huh?"
27-07-2019T18:01:41,MarvTheHugPharaoh,wb father <3
27-07-2019T18:01:41,NezumiYuki,wb Dad
27-07-2019T18:01:52,NextGenAnubisKid,WB Dadrobit ^^
27-07-2019T18:01:57,Dadrobit,Can imagine he first one musta' gotten a fair bit of love.
27-07-2019T18:02:16,Glassan,Certainly did.
27-07-2019T18:02:35,NextGenAnubisKid,Oh it did for sure ^^
27-07-2019T18:03:44,Dadrobit,I have decided that 110 degrees is a disagreeable event. Cold beverages are a fine fix for it though.
27-07-2019T18:03:47,TeapotOfDoom,Hi daddy!
27-07-2019T18:04:36,Dadrobit,"Alas with this glass, I am in dire need of a trip to the store."
27-07-2019T18:04:59,NextGenAnubisKid,Errands to run in hot weather? Yeah that's no fun haha
27-07-2019T18:05:04,TeapotOfDoom,Thy shall go and get what has to be gotten
27-07-2019T18:05:05,NextGenAnubisKid,Hope you stay cool and hydrated though!
27-07-2019T18:05:43,NezumiYuki,Geez Dadrobit..... That's almost 45c... How the bloody hell are you not half baked?  o.O
27-07-2019T18:06:04,Dadrobit,Traditionally I solve not being half baked by being fully baked.
27-07-2019T18:06:10,Bgrmystr2,being used to the temps by living there.
27-07-2019T18:06:14,NezumiYuki,LOL!
27-07-2019T18:06:17,Bgrmystr2,probably tends to help
27-07-2019T18:06:34,TeapotOfDoom,45??? Holy cow
27-07-2019T18:06:47,Dadrobit,And going to the store is no longer an option for me. It can wait.
27-07-2019T18:06:49,TeapotOfDoom,Also nice solution
27-07-2019T18:07:24,NezumiYuki,Yes teapot... 110F or close to 45ish Celsius.....
27-07-2019T18:07:29,Bgrmystr2,110 isn't fun
27-07-2019T18:07:36,Dadrobit,:/ Can't do that anymore. My job has regular and random drug tests all the time.
27-07-2019T18:07:54,Glassan,Sounds inconvenient.
27-07-2019T18:07:54,Dadrobit,Even though it's totally legal and I got my card ages ago.
27-07-2019T18:08:10,NezumiYuki,Ahhh NeoBurning Town!   Gotta love Shantae!
27-07-2019T18:08:54,Dadrobit,Bing tells me 110F = 43.333rC
27-07-2019T18:09:12,MarvTheHugPharaoh,110f!   Thats hell
27-07-2019T18:09:42,TeapotOfDoom,Freedomheit is still a mystery to me. I know 110 is a lot but i have no reference
27-07-2019T18:09:57,NextGenAnubisKid,Fahrenheit is just a weird system XD
27-07-2019T18:10:09,NextGenAnubisKid,The scientific equivalent is even weirder XD
27-07-2019T18:10:18,TeapotOfDoom,Rankine?
27-07-2019T18:10:23,NextGenAnubisKid,Yep :P
27-07-2019T18:10:28,Avolendi,45 degrees? That's a very steep temperature. That's just not right. It's half right though.
27-07-2019T18:10:31,Dadrobit,0 = the freezing point for salt water. 100 is close to normal temperatures of the human body.
27-07-2019T18:10:37,TeapotOfDoom,I don't even know why it even exists
27-07-2019T18:11:10,NextGenAnubisKid,IT's so science labs that use the Imperial measuring system have a degree system that scales to absolute zero
27-07-2019T18:11:11,Dadrobit,"At the time it was created, those were decided to be the useful extremes at the time."
27-07-2019T18:11:42,Glassan,The rest is just not wanting to change all the systems around.
27-07-2019T18:11:51,ProsePro7,Appropriate music for the sketch
27-07-2019T18:12:20,TeapotOfDoom,I read a document about designing rocket engines that used imperial exclusively. It was the first time i saw rankine. It was very hard to read
27-07-2019T18:12:58,NextGenAnubisKid,It's just such an unusual system
27-07-2019T18:13:08,TeapotOfDoom,I think we had the exact same debate a few streams ago
27-07-2019T18:13:20,NextGenAnubisKid,"I learned the metric system in school, and use the Imperial system at work all the time (chemical engineer)"
27-07-2019T18:13:27,NextGenAnubisKid,But I've never in my life used Rankine XD
27-07-2019T18:14:04,TeapotOfDoom,Metric all the things imo
27-07-2019T18:14:18,NextGenAnubisKid,Metric would make unit conversions so much easier XD
27-07-2019T18:14:27,TeapotOfDoom,So many conversion errors
27-07-2019T18:14:46,NextGenAnubisKid,That's how NASA crashed a rover and lost tens of millions; a metric to imperial conversion error :P
27-07-2019T18:14:53,NezumiYuki,"<<<< Has grown up with the Americanized Imperial system, and is slowly coming to terms with Metric and I can't get why our schooling systems never converted over to metric SOONER.   Metric is so much quicker to convert between units."
27-07-2019T18:14:58,TeapotOfDoom,I know
27-07-2019T18:15:08,NezumiYuki,I liter of filtered water is a Kilogram
27-07-2019T18:15:16,Glassan,President Carter tried.
27-07-2019T18:15:20,Glassan,And failed miserably.
27-07-2019T18:15:20,NezumiYuki,that's very convenient
27-07-2019T18:15:32,Avolendi,Gets worse when you consider where the imperial system is used in the world
27-07-2019T18:15:43,TeapotOfDoom,100cm is one m. 12 inches is one foot? Why???
27-07-2019T18:16:05,NezumiYuki,25mm is an imperial inch... like whut?
27-07-2019T18:16:10,NextGenAnubisKid,TIs a good question :P
27-07-2019T18:16:19,Dadrobit,"To be fair, 12 is a really great base system."
27-07-2019T18:16:30,NezumiYuki,Hmm true
27-07-2019T18:16:34,Dadrobit,It divides very nicely.
27-07-2019T18:16:52,YamiDragoon,"that rat is everywhere, EVERYWHERE :O"
27-07-2019T18:16:54,FluffKevlar,:cfluffkevlar-c6:
27-07-2019T18:16:55,TeapotOfDoom,It's a different system. That's the least problematic

27-07-2019T18:22:58,NezumiYuki,"I kinda told Nora that Tom might like one of those ""Girls in a cake"" deals, so she laughed, and promptly dove into the cake I wizarded up right in front of her, and well here's the result.  https://www.deviantart.com/nezumiyuki/art/Nora-Noms-807285273"
27-07-2019T18:22:59,Dadrobit,o/ combak

27-07-2019T18:23:49,TeapotOfDoom,Nice nezumi
27-07-2019T18:23:57,TeapotOfDoom,I like the title lol
27-07-2019T18:24:20,NezumiYuki,"Also Nora asked if humans still like that old silly tradition of Birthday licks, and I said yes, but you could always mix it up a bit."
27-07-2019T18:24:28,NezumiYuki,So nora chose a riding crop instead
27-07-2019T18:24:46,NezumiYuki,"better to love tap than punch the living daylights out of tom's shoulder, right?"
27-07-2019T18:25:07,BadFoMo,Riding Crop?
27-07-2019T18:25:21,NezumiYuki,"Yes BadFo, a riding crop.  xD"
27-07-2019T18:25:21,TeapotOfDoom,Also the nat looks really cool fluff!
27-07-2019T18:25:34,BadFoMo,What is that?
27-07-2019T18:25:36,Avolendi,"The stuff that if you try to plant it in a field, it runs away"
27-07-2019T18:26:26,NezumiYuki,"hmmm looking up a good quick link, BadFo... Gimme a sec.  Prolly simply direct you to wikipedia or something."
27-07-2019T18:26:51,Dadrobit,"Riding crop, that's the thing you see horse riders use to whip their horse to go faster. Also popular among those into BDSM."
27-07-2019T18:26:54,TeapotOfDoom,I think you're mistakin it with a rock
27-07-2019T18:27:00,NezumiYuki,Meh never mind here's a quick Goog result of Riding crop https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=riding+crop
27-07-2019T18:27:20,FluffKevlar,i dont think google search results are stuff that needs to be linked
27-07-2019T18:27:31,BadFoMo,@Dadrobit That's what I was thinking. ...I think.
27-07-2019T18:27:32,Avolendi,"What ever happened to ""Let me google that for you""? :P"
27-07-2019T18:27:38,NezumiYuki,just copy pastaed for convenience.  xD
27-07-2019T18:27:53,TeapotOfDoom,That's the thing you ride on. Not a crop
27-07-2019T18:28:07,unsteddyphoenix,technically you shouldve asked permission again
27-07-2019T18:28:12,FluffKevlar,@teapotofdoom thanks!
27-07-2019T18:28:21,TeapotOfDoom,Lol i still wait for the day to try that page on someone ^^
27-07-2019T18:28:29,Avolendi,Hahaha
27-07-2019T18:29:18,NezumiYuki,"Awesome lighting as usual, Tom! :D"

27-07-2019T18:29:45,TeapotOfDoom,It's really coming out nice
27-07-2019T18:29:55,Avolendi,Really nice effect with the water/moon reflection yeah
27-07-2019T18:30:25,Avolendi,"Also, congratulations, since I hadn't mentioned that yet >.<"
27-07-2019T18:30:40,TeapotOfDoom,I'll have to watch the rec though... i have to get up in less then 5 hours to catch our ferry...
27-07-2019T18:30:51,NezumiYuki,Okay afk for just a sec

27-07-2019T18:44:35,Mippy,I think so ü§î
27-07-2019T18:45:02,Katfeathers,"Heh, 3D before the polerized glasses"

27-07-2019T18:45:44,BadFoMo,@NezumiYuki Rose: I don't 'Awoo' anymore. It reminds me too much of when Saria and I did that...
27-07-2019T18:45:45,Bgrmystr2,to be honest I've never used any 3d glasses other than those
27-07-2019T18:45:52,Bgrmystr2,so I dunno wtf kinda glasses they have now xD
27-07-2019T18:46:21,Darkewulf,Does anybody else remember Inficolor 3D?
27-07-2019T18:46:27,Darkewulf,it tried so hard to be the next big thing
27-07-2019T18:46:29,Katfeathers,They look like regular sun glasses
27-07-2019T18:46:43,NezumiYuki,I think modern 3D cinema glasses are those funky liquid crystal rapid shutter type.
27-07-2019T18:47:12,Bgrmystr2,did they ever solve the problem of 3d glasses for people who already wear glasses?
27-07-2019T18:47:15,NezumiYuki,At least those were the ones I remember from iMax stuff
27-07-2019T18:47:16,InTheLionsDen,Cinema glasses are inexpensive polarized lenses
27-07-2019T18:47:27,NezumiYuki,Ahhh polarized
27-07-2019T18:47:55,Mippy,No Bgr. I can confirm. 3D glasses with prescription glasses are so uncomfortable
27-07-2019T18:48:18,IronHorseComics,they're uncomfortable regardless
27-07-2019T18:48:21,Bgrmystr2,"RIP, never solved the one glaring issue with them"
27-07-2019T18:48:24,IronHorseComics,I get headaches with 3D
27-07-2019T18:48:32,Katfeathers,"Nah, those are for at home 3D, in the theatres each lens is just polerized in a different direction."
27-07-2019T18:48:36,MarvTheHugPharaoh,to true mippy
27-07-2019T18:48:49,Bgrmystr2,"they'll always be unconfortable though, that's part of the whole mass production with the cheapest materials"
27-07-2019T18:48:56,Bgrmystr2,it comes with the territory
27-07-2019T18:49:13,NezumiYuki,Ah okay so left side polarized lens might be vertical orientated and the right side horizontal... Gotcha!
