29-03-2019T00:49:31,NezumiYuki,"Oh yep, I know that one, Sage!   Good call!"
29-03-2019T00:52:32,SageSaga,for the D&D game I play on Thursdays I play a know it all wizard

29-03-2019T00:53:46,SageSaga,I explained why he was factually wrong about his right to conscript us into his war
29-03-2019T00:53:49,unsteddyphoenix,"""YOU should be reporting to ME"""

29-03-2019T01:00:19,NezumiYuki,"Yeah true, bgr.  I've seen a few witch's hats having belt buckles on them, but for myself, I've never bothered.  My hat is pretty simple, no buckles."
29-03-2019T01:00:53,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: so plain then
29-03-2019T01:00:59,Bgrmystr2,those are nice too

29-03-2019T01:21:46,Bgrmystr2,when keith was blonde
29-03-2019T01:21:47,Bgrmystr2,:O

29-03-2019T01:23:11,Bgrmystr2,cuz he had to restart mid-stream due to photoshop freezing
29-03-2019T01:23:23,Dadrobit,"Oh, was aboutto comment on how Tom started the stream with base colors already done."
29-03-2019T01:23:28,Dadrobit,about to*

29-03-2019T01:26:14,Bgrmystr2,lesse if I can find
29-03-2019T01:28:13,Bgrmystr2,"Tom showed the Raine ref sheet, then his computers, Nora 1 2 and 3, and then old stuff after that I believe"
29-03-2019T01:28:29,Bgrmystr2,"oh right, his color pallette too"
29-03-2019T01:29:00,Bgrmystr2,I think the old stuff is gonna be after 15 mins
29-03-2019T01:29:03,Bgrmystr2,still lookin lol
29-03-2019T01:30:43,Bgrmystr2,@Dadrobit about 19:30 is when he started with the old images
29-03-2019T01:31:24,Bgrmystr2,might have missed one in between but he shows everything between then and the comic
29-03-2019T01:32:52,Bgrmystr2,"13 old stuffs, and the Red gif + Raine's ref"
29-03-2019T01:36:50,Dadrobit,Just scrubbed through the whole beginning. He was showing off old stuffs for like the first 40 minutes.
29-03-2019T01:37:10,Dadrobit,Holy time capsule batman
29-03-2019T01:38:15,Dadrobit,Very inspiring.

29-03-2019T03:33:13,unsteddyphoenix,Extremely problematic Raine
29-03-2019T03:34:45,Dadrobit,"Natnai has YoungNat, Trace has the dark shadow, and now Raine is dealing with WolfRaine."
29-03-2019T03:57:19,Xexanoth,"welll, this is a nice thing to wake up too"
29-03-2019T04:08:20,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-natsducky:
29-03-2019T06:35:47,GamerCent,Why he streaming on PicartoTV?
29-03-2019T06:37:52,Bgrmystr2,"because he streams art, and picarto focuses on art"
29-03-2019T06:38:27,GamerCent,Thx
29-03-2019T06:38:31,Bgrmystr2,while twitch tends to focus people on gaming and has a much larger crowd of people with normal chat less common than chat spam of emoji
29-03-2019T06:38:41,Bgrmystr2,so that probably played some part of it
29-03-2019T06:39:29,GamerCent,Are there any rules for chat?
29-03-2019T06:40:08,Bgrmystr2,"mmmm.. depends on what day, cuz on Friday Sage hosts the multistream and so his rules apply then"
29-03-2019T06:41:21,Bgrmystr2,"but for tom's solo streams, usually just no NSFW stuff, don't be a dick, and be wary of posting links, generally ask first but yeah, tom's pages and stuff are okay"
29-03-2019T06:41:29,Bgrmystr2,"like the patreon, DA, or the comic pages"
29-03-2019T06:42:29,Bgrmystr2,Sage's rules for the friday multistreams can be found below his stream https://picarto.tv/sagesaga
29-03-2019T06:43:11,Bgrmystr2,"and no self-promoting, etc, the usual stuff."
29-03-2019T06:44:00,Bgrmystr2,":ptv-sleepy: and with that, off to ded"
29-03-2019T06:44:40,GamerCent,Can I speak non-English?
29-03-2019T06:45:11,Bgrmystr2,"hmm, I wouldn't recommend."
29-03-2019T06:46:17,GamerCent,"Ok, thanks"
29-03-2019T06:46:19,Bgrmystr2,"Everyone who comes speaks at least some English, so it's the common language. You can whisper someone if you find them able to speak your own."

29-03-2019T14:04:22,Bgrmystr2,hey sage
29-03-2019T14:05:14,SageSaga,yo
29-03-2019T14:06:15,sunblaze,hi everyone
29-03-2019T14:11:33,SageSaga,ok so its a german thing-
29-03-2019T14:11:48,SageSaga,mt :P
29-03-2019T14:11:51,sunblaze,yep and its mandatory to everything you buy/oder/sell
29-03-2019T14:12:07,SageSaga,They should like- tell people that
29-03-2019T14:12:27,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: do what
29-03-2019T14:12:49,SageSaga,Sunblaze got charged an extra 19% for an item I sent
29-03-2019T14:12:51,sunblaze,19% tax in germany from everything you order
29-03-2019T14:13:04,Bgrmystr2,jesus
29-03-2019T14:13:09,sunblaze,its called merhwertsteuer. added value tax or something
29-03-2019T14:13:20,SageSaga,but if i had just added a piece of paper saying what it cost you wouldnt for some reason
29-03-2019T14:13:30,sunblaze,you either pay it full if you order something from outside germany or present a reciept and pay the difference
29-03-2019T14:13:58,Bgrmystr2,yeah that just sounds like theft to me :x
29-03-2019T14:14:23,sunblaze,they also do not open ALL the packges. I ordered 2 custom made trousers once. one I had to pay they ignored the other
29-03-2019T14:14:34,sunblaze,on't try to understand that
29-03-2019T14:14:50,sunblaze,byocracy is evil for a reason
29-03-2019T14:15:03,Bgrmystr2,"that makes it even worse for me, the tax is one thing, but opening a private person's package is just fucked"
29-03-2019T14:15:04,Bgrmystr2,:x
29-03-2019T14:15:23,SageSaga,uh
29-03-2019T14:15:25,sunblaze,"well everyone writes ""gift"""
29-03-2019T14:15:27,SageSaga,they do that everywhere
29-03-2019T14:15:38,sunblaze,and even customs know only mercandise is sent in gifts :D
29-03-2019T14:15:43,Bgrmystr2,not here? I don't get open packages from anywhere.
29-03-2019T14:15:47,sunblaze,so they open it msotly
29-03-2019T14:16:01,SageSaga,anytime something passes through customs
29-03-2019T14:16:10,sunblaze,well they repackage them. it just looks ugly again :P
29-03-2019T14:16:19,Bgrmystr2,My mother gets packages from my friend's parents in sweden and they've never opened it once. Ever.
29-03-2019T14:16:30,Bgrmystr2,I've bought stuff import from japan and also never opened not once.
29-03-2019T14:16:42,sunblaze,consider yourself lucky.
29-03-2019T14:16:55,SageSaga,so great of you to continue using anecdotal evidence to denounce a known thing
29-03-2019T14:17:03,Bgrmystr2,it's illegal to open someone else's mail.
29-03-2019T14:17:08,SageSaga,no it isnt
29-03-2019T14:17:12,Bgrmystr2,yes it is
29-03-2019T14:17:24,Bgrmystr2,"You say it happens to all packages, but my experience is that it is not."
29-03-2019T14:17:24,sunblaze,nope just to remove stuff that is illegal yes. not opening
29-03-2019T14:17:36,SageSaga,its a federal offense to open up another persons mail within the US
29-03-2019T14:17:46,SageSaga,we are talking about Customs checking mail
29-03-2019T14:17:52,sunblaze,within yes. but from outside?
29-03-2019T14:18:01,SageSaga,they do it all the time
29-03-2019T14:18:08,SageSaga,and its not against the law
29-03-2019T14:18:32,SageSaga,how do you know someone hasnt opened it?
29-03-2019T14:18:40,Bgrmystr2,"it does not specify inside the US, so nope. I just found it"
29-03-2019T14:18:52,sunblaze,well I kinda expected it and sage gave me a good price. so I am not unhappy about it
29-03-2019T14:19:45,Bgrmystr2,because the packaging tape is the same as when it was sent
29-03-2019T14:19:54,SageSaga,im not saying that every package gets opened- im saying they open packages all the time
29-03-2019T14:20:22,SageSaga,and how do you know? Do you use special tape that no one else has?
29-03-2019T14:21:11,Bgrmystr2,because I've seen images of the package before it was actually sent. xD
29-03-2019T14:21:18,Bgrmystr2,several times
29-03-2019T14:21:58,Bgrmystr2,"like, seen it after recieving, but yeah taken before it was sent"
29-03-2019T14:22:02,Bgrmystr2,and it's exactly the same
29-03-2019T14:22:07,SageSaga,and im telling you they are allowed to open up any package and check the contents
29-03-2019T14:22:38,SageSaga,just because its never happened to you- doesnt mean it cant happen or doesnt happen
29-03-2019T14:27:15,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
29-03-2019T14:29:29,SageSaga,besides- they usually scan the contents without even opening the box
29-03-2019T14:32:23,LannAF,I FORGOT I'M SORRY
29-03-2019T14:32:32,Bgrmystr2,LannNnNNnNnn
29-03-2019T14:32:35,LannAF,What encoder did you recommend I use Sage?
29-03-2019T14:32:39,LannAF,hey bgr
29-03-2019T14:32:57,Bgrmystr2,I saw some of that Satisfactory stream you did a couple days back
29-03-2019T14:33:09,Bgrmystr2,"if you guys are gonna do that more, I'll watch, looks fun"
29-03-2019T14:33:11,LannAF,We hit 53 followers!
29-03-2019T14:33:16,SageSaga,dude
29-03-2019T14:33:22,Bgrmystr2,I'll make it 54 :V
29-03-2019T14:33:24,SageSaga,i told ya all that in text
29-03-2019T14:33:30,LannAF,oh. Right.
29-03-2019T14:33:33,LannAF,Search function
29-03-2019T14:33:39,LannAF,Sorry I'm a little frazzled right now haha
29-03-2019T14:34:05,LannAF,"Yeah bgr, the schedule is in there, but I'd rather not talk about my stuff too much in sage's stream"
29-03-2019T14:34:10,LannAF,that'd be ruuuuuude
29-03-2019T14:34:31,Bgrmystr2,np np :)
29-03-2019T14:34:47,SageSaga,x264 is used by most because its CPU only- but if you dont have a great CPU  QSV uses both Video card and CPU
29-03-2019T14:35:36,LannAF,"huh, there's only the option of NVENC and NVENC new alongside x264"
29-03-2019T14:35:43,LannAF,and I'm already using NVENC
29-03-2019T14:36:09,SageSaga,Nvenc is all GPU which is usually not good if you are using a lot of your GPU
29-03-2019T14:38:57,SageSaga,i did it again
29-03-2019T14:39:02,SageSaga,wth- i blame Lann
29-03-2019T14:39:09,LannAF,?!?!?!
29-03-2019T14:39:14,LannAF,what I do
29-03-2019T14:39:34,SageSaga,distracted me and i put stuff on the wrong layer
29-03-2019T14:39:46,LannAF,I'm the master of disruption
29-03-2019T14:39:56,LannAF,"so much so, I disrupt even myself."
29-03-2019T14:40:40,LannAF,Should I try x264 then Sage since I'm already using NVENC?
29-03-2019T14:40:47,LannAF,Or try the new version of NVENC
29-03-2019T14:41:30,SageSaga,find out whats new about the new one
29-03-2019T14:41:47,Bgrmystr2,I use NVENC because my CPU is fairly weak and it works very well
29-03-2019T14:42:09,Bgrmystr2,but I expect your cpu to be much better
29-03-2019T14:46:50,LannAF,"People say the new version of nvenc fixes a lot of issues the old one had, such as not being as good as x264 at rapid changes"
29-03-2019T14:47:22,SageSaga,nvenc stands for Nvidia video encoder or something right?
29-03-2019T14:47:53,SageSaga,the new one probably has that added improvement to OBS streaming from the 20 series
29-03-2019T14:47:58,LannAF,ooo
29-03-2019T14:48:46,LannAF,I'll try the new one then
29-03-2019T15:01:15,Tharkis,:ctharkis-earwiggle:
29-03-2019T15:01:21,BadFoMo,Yo.
29-03-2019T15:02:46,SageSaga,hey Tharkis
29-03-2019T15:04:41,Tharkis,"trying like mad to get all the errands done today, my last day off work before i fly to japan >_<  but after trimming all the hedges i need some stream time to relax =D"
29-03-2019T15:05:01,BadFoMo,Cool.
29-03-2019T15:05:04,Tharkis,"i guess i'm off tomorrow too, but i have ticket for PAX East sunday so i'll be in boston lol"
29-03-2019T15:05:49,SageSaga,so you are going to PAX and then to Japan?
29-03-2019T15:06:54,Tharkis,"pax, then work for 5 days like mad trying to get everything done, then i fly out at 2am friday night"
29-03-2019T15:07:05,SpazztasticKiwi,PAX is the best
29-03-2019T15:07:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Have the good fun
29-03-2019T15:07:39,Tharkis,"and since i expect work to be like last week, where i was working till 1-3am in the morning everynight to get stuff done, i dont expect to have time in the evenings to get naything done , so i'm packing everythign today"
29-03-2019T15:07:49,Tharkis,"doing laundry, yardwork, etc >_<"
29-03-2019T15:08:17,Tharkis,"I'm trying to convince myself that I need to buy one of those really nice fancy solid metal dice sets while i'm at PAX, spazztastic lol"
29-03-2019T15:08:50,Bgrmystr2,"damn thark, living the life"
29-03-2019T15:08:52,Tharkis,"but... who /really/ needs a 150$ set of dice?  no one... but i kinda want one, even though my D&D group is remote so i have to use a digital die roller anyways=/"
29-03-2019T15:09:43,LannAF,That sucks :c
29-03-2019T15:10:41,Tharkis,Level Up Dice has a huge booth in the tabletop gaming area this year
29-03-2019T15:10:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Robin posted a picture just yesterday after buying the vinal for Slime Rancher
29-03-2019T15:11:24,SpazztasticKiwi,They usually have a giant table up
29-03-2019T15:12:25,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s apparently reserved specially for selling dice
29-03-2019T15:12:58,SpazztasticKiwi,One part anyway. All shapes and colors
29-03-2019T15:13:19,SpazztasticKiwi,"Anyway, I just spent a few minutes shooting a snake off the road"
29-03-2019T15:13:28,Bgrmystr2,yeah my friends were trying to tell me why having all the different kinda dice is cool and I just..
29-03-2019T15:13:30,Tharkis,"they've got semi-precious stone dice too, but cool as it'd be to get a set of obsidian dice or amythest dice"
29-03-2019T15:13:30,Bgrmystr2,it's just dice
29-03-2019T15:13:32,SpazztasticKiwi,shooing
29-03-2019T15:13:38,Tharkis,they're chippy if they hit eachother
29-03-2019T15:14:12,Bgrmystr2,I guess I just don't get it.
29-03-2019T15:14:15,Tharkis,so a set of solid copper or stainless teel machined dice would be indestructible =)
29-03-2019T15:14:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Isn’t there a company that sells a die that has another new die inside for when the outside gets chippy
29-03-2019T15:15:14,SpazztasticKiwi,The appeal I saw for the die was when I went and I saw what looked like a 12 sided iridescent die with some funny symbols
29-03-2019T15:15:31,Tharkis,7 days left on AI kickstarter. I might have to pledge for a 2nd book before i go to japan to see if i can give it a boost
29-03-2019T15:15:40,Tharkis,:ctharkis-takemymoney:
29-03-2019T15:16:28,sunblaze,hmm thats not a bad idea :ptv-scratch:
29-03-2019T15:17:40,SageSaga,btw- if it does end up failing i have a backup-  its more expensive per book- but i can buy less - and shipping is less
29-03-2019T15:18:08,SageSaga,only issue is i gotta pay it all out of pocket- and by that i mean credit because my pockets arent deep
29-03-2019T15:20:50,SpazztasticKiwi,💳
29-03-2019T15:20:54,Tharkis,"however it happens, you can certainly count me in for at least one copy >_<"
29-03-2019T15:21:28,sunblaze,^seconded
29-03-2019T15:21:58,Tharkis,i also plan on buying whatever merch you happen to have at AC too =P
29-03-2019T15:22:17,SageSaga,i need to sell 55 copies to deal with the costs :\
29-03-2019T15:22:40,LannAF,I'll spot you a bit sage!
29-03-2019T15:22:43,SageSaga,the book is the merch i have planned - i dont have time for more XD
29-03-2019T15:22:44,LannAF,You've got my support :D
29-03-2019T15:22:56,LannAF,it's not a lot but
29-03-2019T15:23:01,SageSaga,i'll sell sketches too though while im there
29-03-2019T15:23:14,SageSaga,i'll try and have some prints or something
29-03-2019T15:24:14,Tharkis,"yas, must get sketch from Sage ! :ctharkis-takemymoney:"
29-03-2019T15:24:29,kittyelfie,hi
29-03-2019T15:24:50,Mippy,:ctwokinds-zenshocked: *[Please take my monwy]
29-03-2019T15:24:58,Mippy,Also Hello
29-03-2019T15:25:08,SageSaga,yo Mippy
29-03-2019T15:25:15,FoxxTrotter,"Hi, Mippy."
29-03-2019T15:25:36,Mippy,Won’t be here for long.  At work.
29-03-2019T15:26:24,SageSaga,thanks for joining anyways
29-03-2019T15:27:03,Mippy,No probs...
29-03-2019T15:27:23,SageSaga,would this make for a good print?
29-03-2019T15:27:47,sunblaze,too be honest no not really
29-03-2019T15:28:13,SageSaga,can i hear why?
29-03-2019T15:28:14,sunblaze,while pretty action. you see not enough of the chars themselves. the jumping/running hides way to many bodyparts
29-03-2019T15:28:50,SageSaga,so gotta do more pinups
29-03-2019T15:29:01,sunblaze,sadly yes :P
29-03-2019T15:29:03,Tharkis,waiting for stream to catch up
29-03-2019T15:29:10,Tharkis,i dont see the pic you asked if it'd make a good pritn still =D
29-03-2019T15:29:17,Tharkis,i'm like 2 minutes behind it hink lol
29-03-2019T15:29:21,Tharkis,i think
29-03-2019T15:29:27,SageSaga,its the unfinished picture
29-03-2019T15:29:35,sunblaze,or do an actionshot from each. but both at the same setting and can be set beside to see the full picture
29-03-2019T15:29:36,Tharkis,ah it just showed up
29-03-2019T15:29:37,SageSaga,of Kaylin and Nyna
29-03-2019T15:30:28,Tharkis,"i think it's cool, my only cretique of it is as composed you dont actually see much of what makes nyna unique beyond her ears, but it still would make a cool small format print with the AI logo splashed across the top or whatnot =D"
29-03-2019T15:30:37,Tharkis,"also, i cant spell"
29-03-2019T15:31:38,SageSaga,it's the cover for the next chapter
29-03-2019T15:31:44,sunblaze,yeah kaylin hides to much of nyna I agree
29-03-2019T15:31:53,Bgrmystr2,"hmm, yeah I think Nyna is kind of hidden behind Kaylin"
29-03-2019T15:32:03,Mippy,No opinion! Work wifi is not doing what wifi is supposed to do...so I have not seen the image in question
29-03-2019T15:32:09,Twokinds,Y:ctwokinds-karenOOO:
29-03-2019T15:32:14,Bgrmystr2,tommMmMm
29-03-2019T15:32:16,sunblaze,hi tom!
29-03-2019T15:32:16,Mippy,Yoi
29-03-2019T15:32:46,SageSaga,yo Tom
29-03-2019T15:33:03,Tharkis,"I think it works perfectly as a chapter head image.  As a print, you want to catch the attention of peopel who may not necessarily know the characters already, hence my Nyna being covered/obscured comment =)"
29-03-2019T15:33:08,Tharkis,good evening Tom
29-03-2019T15:34:01,Tharkis,"When i'm at a con being inundated with prints and art everywhere, it's the unique characters that jump out and catch my attention, whether i know them or not before hand."
29-03-2019T15:34:26,SageSaga,Tom will help me pick out a cool pose to draw Kaylin and Nyna in for a print- wont ya Tom?
29-03-2019T15:36:35,Mippy,"Well, time to get back to work. See ya all tomorrow"
29-03-2019T15:36:45,sunblaze,take care mippy
29-03-2019T15:36:46,SageSaga,take care Mippy
29-03-2019T15:37:00,BadFoMo,Bye.
29-03-2019T15:37:32,Tharkis,yeah i should get back to errands myself.  Trying to be all packed for 9 days in japan by the end of today
29-03-2019T15:37:47,Tharkis,"(well, 7 days, 2 days are travel days so dont get to do much)"
29-03-2019T15:38:25,SageSaga,bye Tharkis thanks for dropping by
29-03-2019T15:38:40,BadFoMo,Bye?
29-03-2019T15:38:43,Bgrmystr2,"seeya thark, have fun man"
29-03-2019T15:38:50,sunblaze,enjoy it tharkis!
29-03-2019T15:39:37,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d like to try PAX again
29-03-2019T15:40:00,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d also like to try Momo in Atlanta but need car
29-03-2019T15:40:04,SpazztasticKiwi,And time off
29-03-2019T15:46:54,CommanderTrace,Hello guys:ptv-greetings:

29-03-2019T15:53:00,LannAF,it was pretty great
29-03-2019T15:55:12,SageSaga,everything is better with Tom and I
29-03-2019T15:58:18,SageSaga,stream ending soooon
29-03-2019T15:59:16,SageSaga,Done!
29-03-2019T15:59:35,BadFoMo,Cool.
29-03-2019T15:59:37,BadFoMo,*!
29-03-2019T15:59:54,SageSaga,normally i would work on something else for another hour or so
29-03-2019T16:00:00,SageSaga,buuuut - my wrist hurts-
29-03-2019T16:00:04,Bgrmystr2,ooo page lookin nice
29-03-2019T16:00:08,Bgrmystr2,damn you finished this one quick sage
29-03-2019T16:00:11,BadFoMo,Works for me.
29-03-2019T16:00:26,SageSaga,i had to work faster - the longer i work the more it hurts
29-03-2019T16:00:33,sunblaze,sore take a rest and feel healthy (I hope)
29-03-2019T16:00:40,SageSaga,peace folks! thanks for joining- im gonna wrap this hand
29-03-2019T16:01:02,BadFoMo,...Are you right or left handed?
29-03-2019T16:01:06,Bgrmystr2,Thanks for streamin then
29-03-2019T16:01:08,SageSaga,right
29-03-2019T16:01:17,FoxxTrotter,"C-ya, Sage. Thanks for the stream."
29-03-2019T16:01:30,BadFoMo,"Ah, Cool. Also, bye."
29-03-2019T16:01:46,SageSaga,im ambidextrous but i only learned to write and draw with my right
29-03-2019T16:02:36,SageSaga,it pissed off my little league coach because he had never heard of anyone who was ambidextrous
29-03-2019T16:03:21,SageSaga,"and I couldnt tell him if i was right or left handed- ""Which hand do you write with?"" ""You're right handed-"" ""Stop throwing with your left arm!"" ""What? You're left handed? This makes no sense!"""
29-03-2019T16:04:25,Bgrmystr2,lool
29-03-2019T16:05:42,BadFoMo,"Cool. I askeddue to my 'friend's' mother had a sprainded left wrist (which needed [I think?] bandageing) and my over active imagination said ""Is this going to be a running thing?""."
29-03-2019T16:05:56,BadFoMo,*asked due
29-03-2019T16:06:10,BadFoMo,"...Also, a little late."
29-03-2019T16:19:36,CrimsonQuill,Evening all
29-03-2019T16:19:39,CrimsonQuill,Hi
29-03-2019T16:19:50,CrimsonQuill,What have I missed this past week?
29-03-2019T16:28:01,CrimsonQuill,Anyone here?
29-03-2019T16:30:10,anonlooker,Hello.
29-03-2019T16:30:32,CrimsonQuill,Good evening
29-03-2019T16:30:57,anonlooker,"Tom has a new computer, new comic page is out, and there was a Friday stream."
29-03-2019T16:31:26,CrimsonQuill,Ooooh.
29-03-2019T16:31:27,CrimsonQuill,I see.
29-03-2019T16:31:43,CrimsonQuill,"I've been gone often from here, so I've missed a bunch."
29-03-2019T16:31:58,CrimsonQuill,I will not consider myself worthy of Twokinds until next weekend.
29-03-2019T16:35:25,CrimsonQuill,I'm permitting myself on the chat however...
29-03-2019T16:36:16,CrimsonQuill,For a few days.

29-03-2019T20:54:17,CrRAR,oh good
29-03-2019T20:54:43,SpazztasticKiwi,"Which after said three days and upon going back to normal walking, my foot was like “what are you doing?”"
29-03-2019T20:54:59,CrRAR,lol

29-03-2019T20:55:42,SpazztasticKiwi,My ankles are double jointed which means while they randomly give me gravity checks I can walk on the sides of my feet
29-03-2019T20:56:03,CrRAR,So you were practicing basically the Raine (as she is now) walk.
29-03-2019T20:56:13,CrRAR,Highly appropriate timing!
29-03-2019T20:56:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Unfortunately no callouses and the fact that’s not normal walking
29-03-2019T20:56:32,CrRAR,that takes skill
29-03-2019T20:56:38,CrRAR,good work
29-03-2019T20:57:09,CrRAR,Not even an extra shoe orthotic or anything. Kudos. lol
