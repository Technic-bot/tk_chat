01-12-2019T00:09:42,JojoF2415,I was working on a drawing of my original character
01-12-2019T00:10:18,BadFoMo,"Wait, how did that happen?"

01-12-2019T00:14:22,JojoF2415,i had a bit of trouble sleeping yesterday. I shouldn’t have listened to that tape
01-12-2019T00:15:14,SpazztasticKiwi,pac man stckfight?
01-12-2019T00:16:28,AspiringNoodle,Tomorrow... I draw...
01-12-2019T00:16:47,AspiringNoodle,"Tonight, I watch this madness, lol"
01-12-2019T00:17:19,AspiringNoodle,"Jojo, how'd the drawing go?"
01-12-2019T00:20:53,BadFoMo,...Wat?
01-12-2019T00:22:12,SpazztasticKiwi,I have a feeling he just doesn’t want to get up and get something else
01-12-2019T00:25:44,JojoF2415,I think my drawing will take as long as the month of December
01-12-2019T00:28:01,JojoF2415,The kathrine in a martini glass from Tom took me 25 days to recreate. I was drawing it in secret
01-12-2019T00:28:30,JojoF2415,And time was not on my side as well
01-12-2019T00:30:00,AspiringNoodle,OH dear lord
01-12-2019T00:30:11,BadFoMo,Tom: No.
01-12-2019T00:30:26,AspiringNoodle,Took long enough!
01-12-2019T00:31:19,JojoF2415,I also tried draw a panned from the comic but my paper was too smaller I had to draw tiny so I gave up
01-12-2019T00:32:09,AspiringNoodle,LMAO
01-12-2019T00:32:20,AspiringNoodle,"""My planet needs me!"""
01-12-2019T00:34:55,JojoF2415,My profile pic is a drawing of kat drawn by me. I did use a reference

01-12-2019T00:35:41,AspiringNoodle,WHAT?!?
01-12-2019T00:35:50,AspiringNoodle,THIS GAME HAS GHOSTS
01-12-2019T00:36:02,Sclimshady,Are you objectifying my culture Teddy?
01-12-2019T00:37:20,AspiringNoodle,"Oh no, the big suck"
01-12-2019T00:37:28,AspiringNoodle,HE USED IT!
01-12-2019T00:38:28,AspiringNoodle,This game is so messed up and I love it
01-12-2019T00:40:23,JojoF2415,The day I was curious to search up toms name shocked me
01-12-2019T00:40:36,BadFoMo,Mark?
01-12-2019T00:41:08,JojoF2415,I knew who markiplier was but I didn’t watch his content. I even forgot about mark
01-12-2019T00:41:52,BadFoMo,The passwords is 12345?
01-12-2019T00:42:25,JojoF2415,Twokinds is my first web comic I have ever read
01-12-2019T00:42:38,AspiringNoodle,"I *think* it was mine, I can't remember"
01-12-2019T00:43:05,AspiringNoodle,"All I know is that I have regrets about the past 10 years or so, and my anxiety is picking up again, lol"
01-12-2019T00:43:25,AspiringNoodle,"Welp, time to cull more stuff from Youtube to free up more time in the future :P"
01-12-2019T00:43:56,JojoF2415,"I started to read Twokinds in this year in august 11,2019 at 2:09 am"
01-12-2019T00:44:17,AspiringNoodle,I started back in high school
01-12-2019T00:44:26,AspiringNoodle,But I eventually got super sucked into video games and nearly forgot about it
01-12-2019T00:45:17,JojoF2415,The day I joined the stream is the same day I got a permanent scar
01-12-2019T00:45:35,AspiringNoodle,What happened?
01-12-2019T00:45:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom have you ever tried a fried pickle
01-12-2019T00:46:13,JojoF2415,I wasn’t paying attention during PE and crashed into a bench

01-12-2019T00:50:19,JojoF2415,I had a deep cut and it even didn’t hurt. I kept on doing activities until a student told the teacher about my cut and I was sent to the office
01-12-2019T00:52:08,JojoF2415,Gn
01-12-2019T00:52:27,BadFoMo,Good night.
01-12-2019T00:52:35,JojoF2415,I’m not supposed to be awake
01-12-2019T00:54:14,BadFoMo,I hate invisable walls.
01-12-2019T00:54:40,JojoF2415,I hate avocados

01-12-2019T00:57:58,AspiringNoodle,"Jojo, you ever get so used to something and then have a hard time figuring out how to cut back or remove entirely?"
01-12-2019T00:59:22,JojoF2415,No
01-12-2019T00:59:52,SpazztasticKiwi,you can putt it
01-12-2019T01:00:21,AspiringNoodle,I'm trying to unclutter my youtube subs atm
01-12-2019T01:01:00,JojoF2415,I had a YouTube channel but I deleted it
01-12-2019T01:01:15,BadFoMo,Why?
01-12-2019T01:01:56,JojoF2415,Time and school
01-12-2019T01:04:03,BadFoMo,I would have just abandoned it for the time.
01-12-2019T01:04:07,JojoF2415,I would upload timelapse videos of me drawing anime
01-12-2019T01:05:45,JojoF2415,I don’t know what to draw now because I kind of don’t like anime anymore. I still like dragon ball and Pokémon
01-12-2019T01:06:06,BadFoMo,Draw them then?
01-12-2019T01:06:41,AspiringNoodle,I'm trying to get my entertainment under control ._.
01-12-2019T01:07:10,AspiringNoodle,"Like, I've had a hulu sub I haven't used in months because I've got a ridiculous Youtube backlog.  My consumption is out of hand"
01-12-2019T01:07:28,JojoF2415,I draw Twokinds now and my original characters
01-12-2019T01:08:34,BadFoMo,Cool.

01-12-2019T01:09:59,JojoF2415,That would be hilarious
01-12-2019T01:10:18,BadFoMo,Udemy?
01-12-2019T01:10:34,AspiringNoodle,"Like Skillshare, but you buy individual courses and own them forever"
01-12-2019T01:10:47,BadFoMo,Ok.

01-12-2019T01:12:53,AspiringNoodle,Have fun crushing them zerg/terran/iforgethe3rdrace?
01-12-2019T01:13:09,Dadrobit,It would appear that I have forgotten 92% of all my hotkeys.
01-12-2019T01:13:25,Dadrobit,It's like riding a bike though.
01-12-2019T01:13:27,JojoF2415,I find digital art a bit more difficult than traditional art
01-12-2019T01:13:38,AspiringNoodle,"Jojo, you aren't wrong, lol"
01-12-2019T01:13:41,Dadrobit,"""Oh yeah, now I remember that hotkey that I totally forgot"""
01-12-2019T01:13:53,JojoF2415,I spent way too long on my first digital art
01-12-2019T01:14:03,AspiringNoodle,"Unless you start off with a screen tablet, you are gonna have a major disconnect"
01-12-2019T01:14:21,JojoF2415,I used my phone and my hands
01-12-2019T01:14:24,Dadrobit,"Also, ""Protoss"" that's the one you forgot"
01-12-2019T01:14:40,AspiringNoodle,"Thank you, that was gonna drive me nuts!"
01-12-2019T01:15:06,Dadrobit,"Also, there are way too many new units"
01-12-2019T01:15:33,AspiringNoodle,I'm watching strem while waiting for a WoW LFR queue to pop while also trying to clean up my youtube subs :P
01-12-2019T01:16:50,JojoF2415,I burned myself today because the piece of steel I was hold overheated on the bench grinder
01-12-2019T01:17:04,AspiringNoodle,Not the stupidest way to burn yourself
01-12-2019T01:17:20,JojoF2415,I have multiple burns
01-12-2019T01:17:31,AspiringNoodle,"Like I said, not the stupidest way! lol"
01-12-2019T01:17:52,AspiringNoodle,I once attempted to pick up a piece of metal off the ground after it had been there for a few minutes
01-12-2019T01:17:54,JojoF2415,1 permanent scar and there might be another one
01-12-2019T01:18:02,AspiringNoodle,It was a piece of scrap from using the plasma cutter
01-12-2019T01:18:36,JojoF2415,I grabbed a hot aluminum ingot.
01-12-2019T01:19:00,JojoF2415,The tips of my fingers were burned
01-12-2019T01:20:58,BadFoMo,"Ellis: I ever tell you about the time my buddy, Keith, tried to deep fry a turkey? 3rd digry burns in 95% of his body! People from out of town were calling to complane about the smell of burning flesh."
01-12-2019T01:21:08,JojoF2415,I learned my lesson not to wear sandals while melting metal. A piece of charcoal landed between my toes
01-12-2019T01:21:21,BadFoMo,Ouch.
01-12-2019T01:22:21,JojoF2415,Yea that did hurt. Burning myself isn’t even a big deal for me now
01-12-2019T01:23:10,JojoF2415,It hurts but meh
01-12-2019T01:24:57,BadFoMo,Reminds my of how one of my 'friend's' grandfather (I think?) was able to tuch molten lead to see if it was hot enough.
01-12-2019T01:25:34,BadFoMo,*touch
01-12-2019T01:26:07,JojoF2415,I want to start blacksmithing but I’ll wait till I’m older
01-12-2019T01:27:33,JojoF2415,Now that I think about it. I’ll probably just forge a sword and that will be it
01-12-2019T01:30:51,JojoF2415,I’m off to bed this time
01-12-2019T01:31:09,AspiringNoodle,"Night Jojo, good luck in your endeavors :D"
01-12-2019T01:31:23,JojoF2415,?
01-12-2019T01:31:25,BadFoMo,This is reminding me of that Robin Wilims golf skit.
