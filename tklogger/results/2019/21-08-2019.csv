21-08-2019T02:17:40,Viizl,"Around February i would presume, just curious maybe its none of my business"

21-08-2019T19:07:33,IronHorseComics,you saaaay that
21-08-2019T19:07:56,SpazztasticKiwi,size matters when you consider where it‚Äôs going and how you‚Äôll use it
21-08-2019T19:10:34,IronHorseComics,I wish the size of my stomach would relocate into muscle for my arms... and shoulders... and chest... most especially the back
21-08-2019T19:10:54,IronHorseComics,but no I would actually have to kill myself at the gym for that to happen
21-08-2019T19:11:52,SpazztasticKiwi,that would be fat you‚Äôd be moving
21-08-2019T19:11:54,Sclimshady,"I just wish I could gain weight,  my groceries  budget is killing me"
21-08-2019T19:12:04,SpazztasticKiwi,unless you want ab muscles in your arma
21-08-2019T19:12:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"arms, which in turn would destroy most of your mobility"

21-08-2019T19:13:17,AspiringNoodle,"On the bright side, new shoes, which don't rely on your weight to determine size :D"
21-08-2019T19:13:19,IronHorseComics,I wish the fat would turn to muscle
21-08-2019T19:18:16,CrRAR,I wish I had 90 more pounds of anything. My metabolism be crazy.
21-08-2019T19:19:14,Sclimshady,"mood,  it took me like a year of special dieting to gain 15 lbs"
21-08-2019T19:21:29,IronHorseComics,"then you're lucky, being heavy sucks, big time. finding pants/shorts that fit is a pain and just about every shirt unless you specifically go to a big and tall section was made to show off a guy's abs and pecks"
21-08-2019T19:27:09,SpazztasticKiwi,tight shirts on a man is off putting for me
21-08-2019T19:27:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm always sitting there wondering how they‚Äôre breathing
21-08-2019T19:27:54,AspiringNoodle,"Well, better tight shirts than tight shoes, ahahaha"
21-08-2019T19:28:07,IronHorseComics,I can attest to that
21-08-2019T19:28:11,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm not staring - I‚Äôm trying to make sure you‚Äôre still inhaling
21-08-2019T19:28:16,IronHorseComics,and better than tight pants by a country mile
21-08-2019T19:28:19,AspiringNoodle,"My feet have probably been killing me after every shift because even though my shoes are years old and hella broken in, they're probably a size too small"
21-08-2019T19:28:46,SpazztasticKiwi,you know your feet swell up to a half size every day
21-08-2019T19:28:53,SpazztasticKiwi,from walking
21-08-2019T19:28:53,AspiringNoodle,"Got to the store, some size 15 (4E wide), and it was snug"
21-08-2019T19:28:55,SpazztasticKiwi,and heat
21-08-2019T19:29:08,AspiringNoodle,"Bumped up to 16 (4E), and my feet had breathing room c:"
21-08-2019T19:29:35,SpazztasticKiwi,tight pants on guys is another thing
21-08-2019T19:29:48,AspiringNoodle,"Kiwi, you better not be staring at bulges, lol"
21-08-2019T19:30:00,SpazztasticKiwi,oh please
21-08-2019T19:30:00,AspiringNoodle,"...eeyup, I went there"
21-08-2019T19:30:10,SpazztasticKiwi,I have better things to occupy my time
21-08-2019T19:30:23,IronHorseComics,like staring at a guy's glittering eyes
21-08-2019T19:30:33,AspiringNoodle,That reminds me
21-08-2019T19:30:49,AspiringNoodle,Watch Science Studio's new video about adding an exhaust fan to a computer that has none
21-08-2019T19:30:55,AspiringNoodle,His cat Pepsi steals so much of the show :D
21-08-2019T19:31:29,SpazztasticKiwi,"in hs we had a school ‚Äúdiscussion‚Äù one time about dress code and while they‚Äôre not illegal according to the rulebook, the principal did say he ‚Äúhad never seen so many boys ‚Äòpoured‚Äô into skinny jeans‚Äù as he had that year"
21-08-2019T19:32:25,SpazztasticKiwi,"and besides jeans aren‚Äôt what you look for any kind of bulge in, that‚Äôs sweatpants"
21-08-2019T19:32:45,AspiringNoodle,"Boys + skinny jeans = ""I NEED A TACTICAL STRIKE ON MY POSITION, NOW!!!"""
21-08-2019T19:33:11,AspiringNoodle,"""Do I need to repeat myself? DANGER CLOSE, MOTHER&#*@ER"""
21-08-2019T19:34:19,SpazztasticKiwi,"and on the other hand, you see one, you‚Äôve seen them all"
21-08-2019T19:34:36,SpazztasticKiwi,thankfully the boys on tumblr have cut down
21-08-2019T19:34:41,SpazztasticKiwi,bots
21-08-2019T19:35:16,IronHorseComics,and I just wear cargo shorts because they are cozy
21-08-2019T19:35:49,IronHorseComics,"and plus if I ever wanted to go into a movie theater, I can sneak snacks in instead of overpaying for them"
21-08-2019T19:36:26,SpazztasticKiwi,yea cause all those lumps in your pants aren‚Äôt gonna tip anyone off
21-08-2019T19:38:11,IronHorseComics,"it's worked so far, nobody looks down"
21-08-2019T19:38:56,IronHorseComics,"it's the same thing as the technique ninjas use to quickly hide and ambush, they counted on that fact that most people don't typically look up"
21-08-2019T19:41:28,AspiringNoodle,"Sadly, those overpriced concessions are how movie theaters stay afloat"
21-08-2019T19:41:45,AspiringNoodle,The studio butt-fug the theaters with how sales are split
21-08-2019T19:42:49,AspiringNoodle,I did my part today (mainly because I was hungry / thirsty and didn't have time xD)
21-08-2019T19:43:01,AspiringNoodle,Got some cheetos popcorn and an icee when I saw Hobbs and Shaw :3
21-08-2019T19:43:21,IronHorseComics,"but here's the thing, is theaters didn't overprice their snacks and drinks, there wouldn't be incentive for people to sneak in outside candy.  For women it's easier as they often carry purses"
21-08-2019T19:43:40,AspiringNoodle,But like I said
21-08-2019T19:43:45,AspiringNoodle,That's literally how they stay alive
21-08-2019T19:44:18,AspiringNoodle,"The split of ticket sales is 80% (studio / distributor) 20% theater for the first 2 weeks or so, after which the theater starts to slowly get a bigger cut"
21-08-2019T19:44:42,AspiringNoodle,"But since the first 2 weeks drive the majority of sales, by the time the theater gets a good cut, nobody's seeing the movie at the same rate"
21-08-2019T19:45:36,AspiringNoodle,"If the studio's didn't take such a large portion of ticket sales, the price of concessions would likely come down by a noticeable amount, and this may happen in the near future, because those prices are driving people away"
21-08-2019T19:45:52,AspiringNoodle,"And if nobody goes to the theater to see the movie, the studios will keep getting less money until BOTH industries fail"
21-08-2019T19:46:32,AspiringNoodle,"The age old mantra of capitalism, ""Adapt or die"" :3"
21-08-2019T20:07:54,CrRAR,Procrastination: the solution to adapting or dying.

21-08-2019T20:15:44,Mikemkke034,What was?
21-08-2019T20:15:47,AspiringNoodle,"Turns out I wasn't imagining things, and Gigabyte updated their newer mobos to use the same connector as the other manufacturers :/"
21-08-2019T20:16:01,AspiringNoodle,Gigabyte used to use a 3-pin connector for RGB/ARGB

21-08-2019T20:16:15,Mikemkke034,Hmm :thinking:

21-08-2019T20:20:37,AspiringNoodle,"BUT, I have 2 separate devices that need sata power that aren't actually storage"
21-08-2019T20:20:56,Mikemkke034,Hmm
21-08-2019T20:20:57,AspiringNoodle,There are 3 locations in my case where you can put a pair of storage devices
21-08-2019T20:21:30,AspiringNoodle,And only 1 of these devices seems to be close enough to one of the aforementioned spots
21-08-2019T20:22:03,AspiringNoodle,I can take photos if you want :D

21-08-2019T21:36:21,CrRAR,an your cables be lookin cool~
21-08-2019T21:36:38,CrRAR,Wait like the snake braid type cable?
21-08-2019T21:36:48,AspiringNoodle,Yeah
21-08-2019T21:37:01,AspiringNoodle,Not like the nice onces where each individual wire for the cable is braided
21-08-2019T21:37:09,AspiringNoodle,And then has some nice combs as a bonus~
21-08-2019T21:37:14,CrRAR,"Those used to be nice, yeah not no more do they not bend good anymore?"
21-08-2019T21:37:35,AspiringNoodle,"They do, but they also bunch up everywhere so they can end up wider at bends"
21-08-2019T21:37:42,CrRAR,oh
21-08-2019T21:38:46,CrRAR,When 40pin parallel connectors were a thing those were the best because the ribbons were so stupid.
21-08-2019T21:38:57,AspiringNoodle,This cable management job is gonna be half garbage half good
21-08-2019T21:38:59,CrRAR,That's ancient history now though. xD
21-08-2019T21:39:04,CrRAR,haha
21-08-2019T21:39:06,AspiringNoodle,"Because the case manufacturer did a shiiiiiiiiiit job, lmao"
21-08-2019T21:39:13,AspiringNoodle,And I don't feel like untangling their mess
21-08-2019T21:39:13,CrRAR,That explains EVERY cable management job.
21-08-2019T21:39:20,CrRAR,yeah
21-08-2019T21:40:38,CrRAR,I remeber reading like professional accounts of doing top-tier cable jobs... lots of times they order/have access to lots of cables of varying lengths for all sorts of different setups.
21-08-2019T21:40:53,CrRAR,Lots of case modification happening too I think.
21-08-2019T22:13:00,AspiringNoodle,Ugggggggggh
21-08-2019T22:37:43,AspiringNoodle,This is really starting to piss me off now
21-08-2019T22:38:10,AspiringNoodle,Like it would kill the case manufacturers to give you another quarter or half inch of space for cable management -_-
21-08-2019T22:59:58,AspiringNoodle,any pc builders in the room? xD
