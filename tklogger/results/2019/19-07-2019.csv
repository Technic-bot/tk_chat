19-07-2019T14:24:05,SageSaga,it was like 600 dollars a night last year?

19-07-2019T14:24:59,SageSaga,sure
19-07-2019T14:25:00,BluePhantom90,"Wow, yeah I got some family in Cali... kinda glad I don't live there."
19-07-2019T14:25:20,BluePhantom90,Though Tom has his younger brother
19-07-2019T14:25:32,SageSaga,Cali is a fine place- but their housing market is trash
19-07-2019T14:25:43,Sclimshady,Tell me about it
19-07-2019T14:25:55,SageSaga,his lil' brother doesnt live close enough to the venue to stay with him

19-07-2019T14:26:00,Sclimshady,Theres an apartment near me for 3500 a month
19-07-2019T14:26:08,BluePhantom90,depends on which parts in Cali you also mean. You might find a place full of crap and needles
19-07-2019T14:26:17,Oci,Cali just is not a place to live
19-07-2019T14:26:27,Oci,unless you are unreasonably well off
19-07-2019T14:27:10,Sclimshady,"Im definitely not, but my scholarship pays rent"
19-07-2019T14:27:32,RimaDraws,aww cute sketch!
19-07-2019T14:27:54,BluePhantom90,No its a place if you have unlimited Funds. Taxes are a pain and I remember last time I got a $10 meal in Ohio cost me $20 in California
19-07-2019T14:28:41,BluePhantom90,"they don't have the ""Dollar Menu"" at fast food place I hear."
19-07-2019T14:29:00,Sclimshady,"We do, its just 30 or so cents more"
19-07-2019T14:29:28,SageSaga,well you could end up in a no-name town in Virginia with a prescription for Opioids without even knowing
19-07-2019T14:29:48,Sclimshady,What
19-07-2019T14:30:16,Tharkis,"if you hear banjo music, turn around and flee"
19-07-2019T14:30:30,BluePhantom90,Wasn't there a guy that crashed his car in California and let go because he was a Illegal immigrant
19-07-2019T14:30:34,Tharkis,'yuve got a purrdy mouth'
19-07-2019T14:30:44,SageSaga,there's a town in Virginia up in the mountains that has more prescriptions than people for some really strong drugs
19-07-2019T14:30:59,Sclimshady,"I need to watch more stuff, my friend referenced that all the time and I never understand it"
19-07-2019T14:31:18,SageSaga,Blue- im pretty sure you are missing part of the story there
19-07-2019T14:31:35,SageSaga,that sounds like the headline used for like a Britebart article
19-07-2019T14:33:03,BluePhantom90,heh well what about the Illegal that shot a young woman and got charged for a lesser crime. Not even charged for murder/ owning a illegal hand gun.
19-07-2019T14:33:56,SageSaga,probably missing context there too
19-07-2019T14:34:02,w0lfmare,Sage o/

19-07-2019T14:34:22,Sclimshady,Our court website is so messed up I cant even see my jury report time :ctwokinds-flomad:
19-07-2019T14:34:30,w0lfmare,Hello hello
19-07-2019T14:34:34,Sclimshady,Hi w0lf!
19-07-2019T14:34:41,SageSaga,Ive seen stories where people chose not to prosecute illegals because it will get them deported- but they work out costs outside of court
19-07-2019T14:34:51,Oci,hey w0lf
19-07-2019T14:35:45,SageSaga,in some cases that's better for the person who was hit because if they get deported- good luck getting your money- they were uninsured and lots of people get insurance that helps with that
19-07-2019T14:36:02,OmniOtter,hello
19-07-2019T14:36:11,SageSaga,dont get insurance to help with uninsured motorists*
19-07-2019T14:36:16,Sclimshady,Hi Omni
19-07-2019T14:36:44,BluePhantom90,there was a Judge that snuck out a Illegal when I.C.E. was going to deport him
19-07-2019T14:37:00,SageSaga,thats good
19-07-2019T14:37:15,OmniOtter,"wait, wut"
19-07-2019T14:37:22,BluePhantom90,he had a criminal record
19-07-2019T14:37:26,SageSaga,it's not a good practice to use court appearances to catch illegals
19-07-2019T14:37:26,Ordithus,"If I recall correctly, that was at a state court"
19-07-2019T14:37:30,OmniOtter,"""that's good""?"
19-07-2019T14:37:41,OmniOtter,i disagree saga
19-07-2019T14:38:08,Sclimshady,Less likely to appear if theres that threat
19-07-2019T14:38:12,SageSaga,you think its a good thing to remove people from their home for a small infraction?
19-07-2019T14:38:12,Ordithus,^
19-07-2019T14:38:27,OmniOtter,when they're here illegally yes
19-07-2019T14:38:50,Ordithus,Illegal immigration is primarily a civil offense - not criminal.  Illegal entry is a misdemeanor
19-07-2019T14:38:51,SageSaga,you do know a large part of our economy is helped by illegals and supported by them right?
19-07-2019T14:38:57,Ordithus,Same category as jaywalking
19-07-2019T14:39:13,OmniOtter,and criminal activity
19-07-2019T14:39:29,OmniOtter,man i'm hearing a bunch of crap here
19-07-2019T14:39:30,OmniOtter,"i come in at political talk, i'm gonna leave before this gets messy"
19-07-2019T14:39:38,SageSaga,every economist worth listening to agrees that there is a net benefit to immigrants even illegals
19-07-2019T14:40:34,Ordithus,"Kiit0s, who is this you are drawing?"
19-07-2019T14:40:35,OmniOtter,"legal immigrants yes, illegals no"
19-07-2019T14:40:44,OmniOtter,with that said bye

19-07-2019T14:41:08,Sclimshady,4 Armed bewb squish girl
19-07-2019T14:41:12,BluePhantom90,"Um for those that come Legally yes. Illegals a little, if they are workers and no crime record sure they could be given passage if they fallow guidelines"
19-07-2019T14:41:35,Kiit0s,Ord its the raffle winner's character
19-07-2019T14:41:40,Oci,Most are in the midst of applying for asylum anyway
19-07-2019T14:41:49,SageSaga,illegals pay into things like social security with no way to get it back
19-07-2019T14:42:03,SageSaga,they feed into the system in a way that it helps a lot of people
19-07-2019T14:42:06,Tharkis,"you people do realize that 'being an illegal alien' is the SAME level of 'crime' as jay walking , right?"
19-07-2019T14:42:23,Tharkis,have you crossed the street not at a crosswalk or when the walk light wasnt the right color?
19-07-2019T14:42:30,Tharkis,"congrats, you're just as illegal as an immigrant"
19-07-2019T14:42:38,BluePhantom90,No they don't
19-07-2019T14:43:01,Tharkis,"immigration court doesnt even allow you the right to al awyer because it's NOT criminal court, and it's not a criminal proceeding."
19-07-2019T14:43:05,SageSaga,yes they do - a huge majority of them pay taxes and use fake social security that they pay into that they cant get back
19-07-2019T14:43:26,Ordithus,"Um, yes they do.  Unless their employer wants to be in even deeper trouble.  Payroll taxes always apply, legal, illegal, whatever."
19-07-2019T14:43:32,RheyareZeta,kame what flavor is that cake
19-07-2019T14:43:39,Kameloh,strawberry :cat:

19-07-2019T14:44:12,Ordithus,Cake in general sounds yum
19-07-2019T14:44:14,Oci,Strawberry chocolate cheesecake??
19-07-2019T14:44:21,Kameloh,maybeeee
19-07-2019T14:44:26,RheyareZeta,im having egg sandwhiches right now
19-07-2019T14:44:30,SageSaga,a lot of people think illegals are a drain on society but honestly all the reports and studies say its either slightly a net gain or equal in the end
19-07-2019T14:44:31,Kameloh,:cake::ckameloh-bongocat_50:
19-07-2019T14:44:38,Sclimshady,Egg cake
19-07-2019T14:44:48,SageSaga,so we get more labor at lower costs- at no actual loss
19-07-2019T14:44:56,w0lfmare,Better be vanilla :cw0lfmare-Naokifire:

19-07-2019T14:45:05,SageSaga,i wont defend actual criminals or drug trade though
19-07-2019T14:45:10,Ordithus,w0lf just wants to see the world burn
19-07-2019T14:45:10,MarvTheHugPharaoh,fried egg cake
19-07-2019T14:45:10,Tharkis,"heh, every economist worth thier salt agrees that they're a net economic boon"
19-07-2019T14:45:24,RheyareZeta,i want cheesecake
19-07-2019T14:45:26,Tharkis,want to know how to get rid of the drug trade and solve the prison population problem at the same time?
19-07-2019T14:45:31,Tharkis,do what portugal did
19-07-2019T14:45:34,MarvTheHugPharaoh,ice cream cake is where its at
19-07-2019T14:45:39,Sclimshady,I have cheese cake :cw0lfmare-Embersafe:
19-07-2019T14:45:41,RheyareZeta,only time i ever get it is when i go to the cheesecake factory
19-07-2019T14:45:43,Tharkis,"legalize all drugs, treat addiction as a health issue not a 'moral' isue"
19-07-2019T14:45:56,Tharkis,portugal crime rate dropped in half after they legalized everything
19-07-2019T14:45:57,Sclimshady,"Its so easy to make, just give it a try"
19-07-2019T14:46:10,RheyareZeta,and i always get the cheesecake with the most chocolate
19-07-2019T14:46:12,BluePhantom90,You do know Sage a lot of Money is sent to Mexico and other counties when Illegals make money here. I am more surpised we haven't put a heavy tax on any transfer of money unless outside the states unless your buying Items
19-07-2019T14:46:12,Tharkis,and their drug addiction rate has dropped by 1/3rd since they started treating addicts instead of imprisoning them
19-07-2019T14:46:15,Ordithus,Alcohol prohibition was a huge boon to organized crime back in the day
19-07-2019T14:46:24,SageSaga,it's easier to paint people as evil and threaten them
19-07-2019T14:46:26,Tharkis,exactly ordithus
19-07-2019T14:46:33,Tharkis,prohibition is a perfect example
19-07-2019T14:46:45,Tharkis,"when it was repealed, organized crime collapsed"
19-07-2019T14:46:52,Sclimshady,"Hey, my family was moonshiners, and still are but legally now"
19-07-2019T14:46:53,Tharkis,crime rates went down significantly
19-07-2019T14:46:54,Tharkis,etc
19-07-2019T14:47:09,Ordithus,Plus fewer people got sick from bad booze
19-07-2019T14:47:51,Oci,"We can't ""legalize everything"" right now, though, since it's the exact same (if not worse) air of tension with mexico as when Marijuana was illegalized"
19-07-2019T14:47:59,ZRO4825,Khezu is a butthead monster D:<
19-07-2019T14:48:42,Oci,"Khezu is an arse, no matter how you cut it :u"
19-07-2019T14:48:43,SageSaga,that Omni guy clearly doesnt care to be informed or else he would have joined the conversation instead of being a dick
19-07-2019T14:49:26,SageSaga,i'll always prefer to discuss something and look at data than cast everything aside for something i dont know about
19-07-2019T14:50:34,Kameloh,:ckameloh-naokithinky:
19-07-2019T14:50:34,BluePhantom90,I am sorry Sage but here is my problem. We have laws that need to be fallowed. Some Law makers want to Pick and choose which law to fallow. We can't do that
19-07-2019T14:50:45,SageSaga,we have to do that
19-07-2019T14:50:51,SageSaga,if we dont you still have Slavery
19-07-2019T14:51:10,SageSaga,blindly following the law allows people to get away with not growing
19-07-2019T14:51:14,Verdauga,where the hell are the party rings kame

19-07-2019T14:52:49,BluePhantom90,Um what? Isn't a Employer hiring a illegal paying him less then Minimum a different form of slavery?

19-07-2019T14:52:55,sunblaze,also you use sirens and lights. usal drivers can not do that :D

19-07-2019T14:55:20,SageSaga,im for Illegals becoming legal- but our system to make that happen is messed up and takes forever

19-07-2019T14:55:39,sunblaze,thats a quite neat job.
19-07-2019T14:55:45,BluePhantom90,Well 1. its illegal to hired illegals and have to pay a fine. 2. A illegal don't really have citizen rights since they are not from this country. 3. So its technically 2 people being the criminal here.
19-07-2019T14:55:51,Verdauga,i can feel them blocking my arteries from here
19-07-2019T14:56:01,Kameloh,XD

19-07-2019T14:56:04,SageSaga,they have human rights though
19-07-2019T14:56:06,Oci,"Yea, it takes multiple years, sometimes a decade to get processed."
19-07-2019T14:56:18,SageSaga,which is something we as MURICA believe strongly in
19-07-2019T14:56:25,BluePhantom90,Human rights yes! Citizen rights no
19-07-2019T14:56:44,Ordithus,"Heck, most constitutional rights still apply. Like search and seizure, fair trial, etc"
19-07-2019T14:56:47,SageSaga,yeah and its a violation of their human rights to send them to a place we know they are likely to die in
19-07-2019T14:58:26,BluePhantom90,"I am sorry but they were willing to risk their lives paying Coyotes to get them across, almost selling themselves into slaver to them to pay a bill they can never pay back"

19-07-2019T15:01:33,SageSaga,you should look into a less bias place- fox is pretty toxic with their opinions instead of news
19-07-2019T15:01:38,TheArtOfDHT,did anyone see the horror known as Cats the movie
19-07-2019T15:01:43,Sclimshady,Hi DHT o/

19-07-2019T15:02:11,Sclimshady,Not watched but saw some articles
19-07-2019T15:02:22,TheArtOfDHT,what were they thinking
19-07-2019T15:02:29,TheArtOfDHT,should have been animated or people in costumes
19-07-2019T15:02:39,MarvTheHugPharaoh,they wanted to do furry but bitched out half way through
19-07-2019T15:02:45,RimaDraws,back

19-07-2019T15:02:55,BluePhantom90,"What like CNN or MSNBC those people kept reporting ""Trump Russia Collusion"" being real for 2 years until Muller blew their news up"
19-07-2019T15:03:03,Sclimshady,"Everyone is saying it was a furry designed movie, but hell no"
19-07-2019T15:03:24,SageSaga,see- you might want to look more into the whole Muller thing then
19-07-2019T15:03:40,Oci,"It's not, it's designed for theatre folks"
19-07-2019T15:03:57,SageSaga,"you'll see there was no ""collusion"" but there was not a lack of trying XD"
19-07-2019T15:03:59,BluePhantom90,I did and Muller said Russia tried to infiltrate the Trump admin and failed.
19-07-2019T15:04:10,SageSaga,did you see why?
19-07-2019T15:04:10,Sclimshady,And we get the blame :weary:
19-07-2019T15:04:42,Oci,"I mean, I like theatre, but I was thinking Cats was just going to stay a stage-only thing"
19-07-2019T15:04:43,BluePhantom90,Because they tried to contact officals that were not really connected to Trumo

19-07-2019T15:05:25,SageSaga,they got to his son and several of his higher ups- but it was stopped mostly by them being too inept

19-07-2019T15:11:17,SageSaga,this was Trump Jr being offered information on Clinton and him trying to setup a way to get the information

19-07-2019T15:12:04,Tharkis,"lets just put it this way, according to surveys and research, people who only watch Fox News, know LESS of the actual news and what's going on in the world than people who dont watch the news at all >_<"
19-07-2019T15:12:18,Kameloh,no worries kiit!
19-07-2019T15:12:21,SageSaga,so Blue- what are your thoughts on kids in cages?
19-07-2019T15:12:25,Tharkis,"blue phantom90, you're mixing up like 30 different things here and coming off as really really ignorant right now"
19-07-2019T15:12:31,MarvTheHugPharaoh,They could have gone full Disney and just have cgi cats dancing around.  No half furry half people things
19-07-2019T15:12:41,sunblaze,^yeah
19-07-2019T15:12:44,BluePhantom90,Oh back in 2014?
19-07-2019T15:12:46,Tharkis,like your'e spouting 'keywords' without knowing which are even realated

19-07-2019T15:12:58,MarvTheHugPharaoh,^
19-07-2019T15:12:59,SageSaga,no Blue- right now
19-07-2019T15:13:03,Sclimshady,I love old disney animation
19-07-2019T15:13:18,Tharkis,"with cats, the #1 thing that bothers me is, the broadway costumes had the iconic ""big puffy hair"""
19-07-2019T15:13:19,SageSaga,because we still have kids who dont know where their parents are
19-07-2019T15:13:30,SageSaga,that whole thing never went away
19-07-2019T15:13:33,RimaDraws,where trump has all these kids locked up in cages cause their families are illegals
19-07-2019T15:13:36,sunblaze,it seems like a half-asses atempt to promote furries but actually it just makes them roll their eyes on how artificial it looks
19-07-2019T15:13:37,Tharkis,"and instead of keeping the big puffy hair, they made them all bald, just keeping human hair would have been better"
19-07-2019T15:14:08,happyguyone,@RimaDraws and that makes it okay ?
19-07-2019T15:14:22,BluePhantom90,"Yes because some are brought over by people who are not their Parents and about 45% of the so called ""Parents"" are not their Biological parents?"
19-07-2019T15:14:25,RimaDraws,no i dont think it makes it okay. i was giving blaze a clue
19-07-2019T15:14:37,SageSaga,where's your proof of that?
19-07-2019T15:14:50,RimaDraws,but i am not getting into politics because it makes friends enemies
19-07-2019T15:14:54,SageSaga,where do you get that kinda data?
19-07-2019T15:15:08,Tharkis,"he has no proof, it's a lie that has been spouted by fox news without any proof"
19-07-2019T15:15:14,Tharkis,but which is patently false
19-07-2019T15:15:33,Sclimshady,"I feel that Rima, I have so many political opposite friends because we dont talk about that stuff"
19-07-2019T15:15:38,BluePhantom90,I will look it up. It was Hooman that started using DNA kits to check these so called Parents

19-07-2019T15:28:06,BluePhantom90,I am sorry Dose the UN run the U.S.?
19-07-2019T15:28:08,Tharkis,"1948, passed us congress in 1951, along with the Convention relating to the status of refugees, and re0passed again in 1967"
19-07-2019T15:28:16,SageSaga,that article also doesnt discuss the numbers right either- 30% of tests came back negative
19-07-2019T15:28:16,Tharkis,with the protocol relating to the status of refugges
19-07-2019T15:28:44,SageSaga,so its not a good estimate of how many people do this

19-07-2019T15:31:11,SageSaga,illegal immigrants are a problem- that's true- how we deal with them i think is more important

19-07-2019T15:33:44,SageSaga,i think we can all agree that separating families is a bit too much right? I mean the circumstances of everyone should be accounted for right? If a person flees to the US because their family is in danger- we should help right?
19-07-2019T15:33:47,MarvTheHugPharaoh,97!!

19-07-2019T15:39:36,SageSaga,CrRAR - how does that work?
19-07-2019T15:39:39,BluePhantom90,"If they cross terrain hazardous to children, or malnourished"
19-07-2019T15:39:46,CrRAR,I'm just imagining that as a lamp with a happy face on it
19-07-2019T15:39:55,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I want that lamp now
19-07-2019T15:40:03,CrRAR,lol
19-07-2019T15:40:09,Oci,Could probably get one like that
19-07-2019T15:40:16,SageSaga,Blue- arent they doing that because its safer that where they come from?
19-07-2019T15:40:22,CrRAR,dunno ask Marv he's the pioneer
19-07-2019T15:40:41,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Just a happy little lamp that has ""You can do it, I'll show you."" on it"
19-07-2019T15:40:42,SageSaga,its safer to risk their families lives than stay in a town that is overrun by warring gangs?
19-07-2019T15:40:51,BluePhantom90,"They could come to a port of entry or embassy, not crossing a border in the desert"
19-07-2019T15:41:17,SageSaga,except Trump has said if he catches anyone hes taking their kids away from them-
19-07-2019T15:41:24,SageSaga,so it scares people away from the ports of entry
19-07-2019T15:41:44,SageSaga,right?
19-07-2019T15:42:59,BluePhantom90,Yet shouldn't a parent care for the well being of their child and not crossing terrain that could kill the child?
19-07-2019T15:43:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,My room feels like it can be a level in Katamari Damacy.  :ptv-kippi2:
19-07-2019T15:43:20,Kameloh,marv XD
19-07-2019T15:43:37,SageSaga,they die either way- at least with the desert there's a chance
19-07-2019T15:43:39,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I should probably do something about that today.
19-07-2019T15:43:41,CrRAR,It's saddest because refugees are often caused by our own foreign policy decisions.
19-07-2019T15:44:29,CrRAR,El presidente wants to have his cake and eat it too.
19-07-2019T15:44:46,BluePhantom90,"If they are separated they will care for. Not crossing a Desert. Wouldn't a citizen of the U.S. lose their child with ""child endangerment"""
19-07-2019T15:45:14,SageSaga,you need to think of context
19-07-2019T15:45:28,CrRAR,"Like that time he was ""forced"" to accept the refugees passed from Australia.... because it's humane to accept them due to global ""business""."
19-07-2019T15:45:44,SageSaga,is it child endangerment if you take your child out of a dangerous environment and do your best to get them to a safe one?

19-07-2019T15:49:50,SageSaga,I dont think its stupid to do everything you can to protect your kids
19-07-2019T15:50:27,BluePhantom90,If you go to a embassy you can apply as well. Every Illegal given citizenship has cut infront of people trying to come here Legally for their families?
19-07-2019T15:50:44,BluePhantom90,Is that fair?
19-07-2019T15:51:08,sunblaze,is it fair to be forced to chooce between certain death and death most likely?
19-07-2019T15:51:27,SageSaga,the process needs to change and people doing this has made it a topic for discussion
19-07-2019T15:52:46,SageSaga,this is how we fix laws- we determine if the law is still valid- if it's required- and what we can do to fix it
19-07-2019T15:52:57,CrRAR,I think we all know the ultimate solution.
19-07-2019T15:52:58,BluePhantom90,"Yes if you leave the country that you fear your in danger from, and cros into another country you can apply for refugee status there."
19-07-2019T15:53:00,SageSaga,clearly there is a problem- we can fix it and make it better for everyone

19-07-2019T15:53:50,CrRAR,I mean America started because people thought it stupid where they originally were.

19-07-2019T15:56:39,BluePhantom90,There are other ways then just crossing a border.
19-07-2019T15:56:55,SageSaga,they arent effective enough

19-07-2019T16:01:40,BluePhantom90,yeah if they all are willing.
19-07-2019T16:01:46,sunblaze,but it would be wishful thinking
19-07-2019T16:02:00,CrRAR,indubitably
19-07-2019T16:02:01,SageSaga,ok Blue - how do they fix it?
19-07-2019T16:02:26,sunblaze,no you can not blue. there are times that laws have to be present and ready to read them. you vote on them AFTER those times
19-07-2019T16:02:37,sunblaze,even if they would do a 100% vote it applies
19-07-2019T16:03:04,RheyareZeta,"Rhey, kiit :cat:"
19-07-2019T16:03:27,sunblaze,but you CAN reduce it to a few weeks yes. still needs everyones agreement

19-07-2019T16:07:31,Kameloh,okay doodle break
19-07-2019T16:07:34,SageSaga,jokes aside- what about when these people cross the boarder because their government is corrupt and waiting for them to try and go to the embassy?
19-07-2019T16:07:51,sunblaze,I was last year and we had HEAVY luggage and it was fine. Just needs more preps :D
19-07-2019T16:08:57,BluePhantom90,the Embassy is a safe zone. If you go to the U.S. Embassy you shouldn't have a problem. And tell me what government isn't corrupt
19-07-2019T16:09:11,SageSaga,there are levels of corruption
19-07-2019T16:09:14,sunblaze,not to mention embassies have no rooms to stay. after applying they have to go back for a while. and are an easy target since thats in their original country they want to escape from
19-07-2019T16:09:24,SageSaga,getting to and into the embassy is a problem
19-07-2019T16:10:21,Oci,"The inside of an embassy is safe, but that does not stop stakeouts, which has been a problem"
19-07-2019T16:10:54,SageSaga,also i wouldnt say Embassys are safe - after all- a reporter was murdered in an embassy not too long ago
19-07-2019T16:11:01,BluePhantom90,what do you think Assuage was hiding at for years
19-07-2019T16:11:22,sunblaze,he was hiding in an office.

19-07-2019T16:12:01,SageSaga,also - why do you think he was stuck inside there? soon as he left it was over
19-07-2019T16:12:10,BluePhantom90,in a embassy by Syria yeah I know. And tell me how un-corrupt that government is?
19-07-2019T16:12:41,Tharkis,...

19-07-2019T16:13:42,BluePhantom90,No the Country that embassy allowed British officials to take him out
19-07-2019T16:13:59,sunblaze,hashoggi went to a saudi arab embassy
19-07-2019T16:14:12,SageSaga,who lived in the US
19-07-2019T16:14:31,BluePhantom90,but wasn't a citizen I believe. His kids were

19-07-2019T16:15:36,Tharkis,"Khashoggi was a permenant US resident, his family is US citizens, he himself was still a saudi arabian citizen."
19-07-2019T16:15:37,sunblaze,which is why turkey is pissed

19-07-2019T16:17:30,sunblaze,jsut not in the US it seems
19-07-2019T16:17:46,CrRAR,yeah the selectiveness of the media is misleading and puzzling

19-07-2019T16:18:29,SageSaga,how does that story make it a hit job on Trump?
19-07-2019T16:19:01,Tharkis,"Journalists being killed in the line of action is one thing, a journalist being assassinated by the head of state of a government is another thing"
19-07-2019T16:19:06,CrRAR,lol just because it happened
19-07-2019T16:19:07,Tharkis,they are not equal
19-07-2019T16:19:08,BluePhantom90,To destory relationship with the U.S. and Saudi Arabia.
19-07-2019T16:19:28,sunblaze,so murder is allowed if relations are kept?
19-07-2019T16:19:33,SageSaga,so Saudi killed a man in another country- so that Trump would look bad?
19-07-2019T16:19:46,SageSaga,Devious
19-07-2019T16:20:22,BluePhantom90,Has the U.S. Relations with Saudi Arabia went down hill?
19-07-2019T16:20:52,sunblaze,it seemed at first yes
19-07-2019T16:20:56,CrRAR,"No, we're on good terms I guess with the munitions deal"
19-07-2019T16:21:03,sunblaze,then Trump decided money is better and waved it
19-07-2019T16:21:11,BluePhantom90,yet they stoped the deal
19-07-2019T16:21:15,SageSaga,ok - provide proof of your conspiracy theory- im fine with political chat but this is some messed up stuff
19-07-2019T16:21:33,sunblaze,they stopped a deal with turkey!

19-07-2019T16:22:44,SageSaga,Trump brings all that on himself by saying stupid things all the time
19-07-2019T16:22:52,SageSaga,he has no one to blame but himself
19-07-2019T16:22:55,CrRAR,"Yeah, literally probably to get ratings."
19-07-2019T16:23:01,CrRAR,It's probably all a ploy
19-07-2019T16:23:18,CrRAR,Trump give them material... they put it on TV

19-07-2019T16:28:39,SageSaga,of course its been mostly negative- hes been mostly negative
19-07-2019T16:28:47,Kameloh,:ckameloh-emberblush50:
19-07-2019T16:28:56,CrRAR,haha
19-07-2019T16:29:04,BluePhantom90,um not like all other Presidents
19-07-2019T16:29:22,sunblaze,yes they did
19-07-2019T16:29:36,sunblaze,you should have seen the shit bush jr got from germany
19-07-2019T16:30:02,BluePhantom90,May I link the Pew study! It shows quite a lot
19-07-2019T16:30:06,SageSaga,"GW Bush is lucky Trump came along- now hes not ""the worse"" XD"
19-07-2019T16:30:13,CrRAR,hahaha
19-07-2019T16:30:21,phil199,"Trump too tho. He isn't ""peoples fav"" over here."
19-07-2019T16:30:39,SageSaga,sure go ahead and link a study
19-07-2019T16:30:46,BluePhantom90,https://www.npr.org/2017/10/02/555092743/study-news-coverage-of-trump-more-negative-than-for-other-presidents
19-07-2019T16:30:52,CrRAR,I just find it funny how similar the playbook is it's like they have a script for decision making for each.
19-07-2019T16:31:18,Kiit0s,this is gonna take a minute to save so brb
19-07-2019T16:31:40,SageSaga,man - its almost like hes not doing well or something to get all that negative press
19-07-2019T16:31:44,Kameloh,gonna mute for a bit! have to get on voice :cat:
19-07-2019T16:32:35,SageSaga,perhaps he shouldnt tell people that our army in the revolutionary war won the war by taking the airports...
19-07-2019T16:32:53,phil199,It's a matter of perspective. Almost like there would some kind of dividing force.
19-07-2019T16:32:57,Oci,The statement in there literally says this is not a good indicator of media bias
19-07-2019T16:34:07,BluePhantom90,anyways I gtg. Get my Dnd game on
19-07-2019T16:34:37,SageSaga,have fun man
19-07-2019T16:34:41,SageSaga,thanks for the discussion
19-07-2019T16:34:47,CrRAR,bye blue
19-07-2019T16:34:50,sunblaze,take care bye
19-07-2019T16:35:15,Oci,Laterr
19-07-2019T16:35:44,phil199,cya blue
19-07-2019T16:37:04,CrRAR,The thing about media is that ultimately it doesn't matter anyway. it's all just noise.
19-07-2019T16:37:14,SageSaga,so- having extra arms is an interesting solution to huge breasts
19-07-2019T16:37:41,sunblaze,^wornds of wisdom
19-07-2019T16:37:45,sunblaze,words
19-07-2019T16:37:50,CrRAR,"I just look at the world and think, ""Well, everyone's just more agitated"""
19-07-2019T16:37:51,Sclimshady,Never buy Bras Again!
19-07-2019T16:37:52,CrRAR,"""Great"""
19-07-2019T16:38:09,CrRAR,lol slim
19-07-2019T16:38:12,CrRAR,indeed
19-07-2019T16:38:26,phil199,Agitated and a tad mad.
19-07-2019T16:38:57,Tharkis,always have one pair of arms crossed holding up your huge breasts so your back doesnt hurt? =D
19-07-2019T16:38:58,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Who needs dumbles when you can lift bob
19-07-2019T16:39:19,Tharkis,"though the thick tail would offset that some, you'd think =)"
19-07-2019T16:39:23,sunblaze,40 push ups right and 40 left
19-07-2019T16:39:24,Kiit0s,XD
19-07-2019T16:39:25,sunblaze,each day :P
19-07-2019T16:39:32,CrRAR,"yes, counterweight~"
19-07-2019T16:39:32,Kiit0s,well the arms are anchored onto her back
19-07-2019T16:39:34,CrRAR,:3
19-07-2019T16:39:35,Sclimshady,Thicc tail
19-07-2019T16:39:44,Kiit0s,so we aren't exactly redistributing the weight anywhere
19-07-2019T16:39:48,Kiit0s,just smushing it around alittle
19-07-2019T16:40:03,RimaDraws,i had to take a break from drawing. hands were cramping
19-07-2019T16:40:05,Oci,Switch arms when tired
19-07-2019T16:40:18,RimaDraws,i cant draw with my left hand
19-07-2019T16:41:31,Sclimshady,"I can't do anything with my left hand, its kinda dumb"
19-07-2019T16:41:34,SageSaga,the arms need to come more from the hips
19-07-2019T16:41:34,Oci,"Hmmm, should practice that some.  Though I was talking about the boobsquish"
19-07-2019T16:41:37,Tharkis,i strained a muscle in my forearm a few weeks back and it's only just now getting better
19-07-2019T16:41:55,RimaDraws,i cant write with my left only my right
19-07-2019T16:41:56,Tharkis,so take care not to hurt yourself drawing! >_<
19-07-2019T16:42:09,Oci,"I can swing bats ambidextrously, that's about it"
19-07-2019T16:42:11,RimaDraws,ive been streaming since 730am
19-07-2019T16:42:56,SageSaga,i can bat and throw ambidextrous and im decent compared to most drawing left - but ive trained my right to draw sooo - yeah
19-07-2019T16:43:52,Tharkis,"i'm ambidextrous as well, but i dont practice witing with my left"
19-07-2019T16:44:12,Tharkis,"i'm a switch hitter for baseball, rowed both sides of the boat in crew, throw with either hand for ultimate frisbie,"
19-07-2019T16:44:16,Tharkis,i only shoot left handed though
19-07-2019T16:44:20,Tharkis,bow/gun/whatever
19-07-2019T16:44:20,PurpleLemons,hello hello o/
19-07-2019T16:44:26,TeapotOfDoom,Good evening
19-07-2019T16:44:30,SageSaga,in art class we had to do left handed drawings (right if you were left)
19-07-2019T16:44:36,Sclimshady,Hi Purp!!
19-07-2019T16:44:45,SageSaga,and I was better than most with the offhand drawing
19-07-2019T16:44:49,TeapotOfDoom,Hi Purp
19-07-2019T16:45:06,TeapotOfDoom,Hi sage
19-07-2019T16:45:06,PurpleLemons,I had to do upsidown drawings .-.
19-07-2019T16:45:31,MarvTheHugPharaoh,PURP! <3
19-07-2019T16:45:34,Oci,Hihi purple
19-07-2019T16:45:54,PurpleLemons,o/ yo
19-07-2019T16:46:34,SageSaga,upside down drawing isnt hard though?
19-07-2019T16:46:53,Kameloh,hey purple how goes
19-07-2019T16:46:55,Kameloh,:D
19-07-2019T16:47:48,RimaDraws,this is looking great sage
19-07-2019T16:48:06,SageSaga,ty
19-07-2019T16:48:21,SageSaga,im going a bit slow because i got a little side tracked with chat XD
19-07-2019T16:48:28,RimaDraws,its ok
19-07-2019T16:48:38,Tharkis,Thanks Obama !
19-07-2019T16:48:39,Tharkis,er wiat
19-07-2019T16:48:42,Tharkis,that meme's too old
19-07-2019T16:48:48,Tharkis,:ctharkis-uneasy:
19-07-2019T16:48:50,Kiit0s,its nice you're interacting with chat though!
19-07-2019T16:49:03,Kiit0s,you're entertaining them for me  :ptv-sneakysmirk:
19-07-2019T16:49:15,PurpleLemons,:cpurplelemons-Eats: got a burrito Kame
19-07-2019T16:49:17,Sclimshady,Kiit's master plan revealed
19-07-2019T16:49:29,SageSaga,it's more entertaining when it isnt politics XD
19-07-2019T16:49:30,Kiit0s,hey purple :wave: :eyes:
19-07-2019T16:49:39,Kameloh,nice!
19-07-2019T16:49:56,SageSaga,like when i talk about a dream i had
19-07-2019T16:50:00,MarvTheHugPharaoh,politics is the best way to kill all fun in the room
19-07-2019T16:50:10,SageSaga,like the iguana wearing stockings
19-07-2019T16:50:27,SageSaga,or being sawed up and eaten by witche
19-07-2019T16:50:28,SageSaga,s
19-07-2019T16:50:57,SageSaga,arent those more fun?
19-07-2019T16:51:01,TeapotOfDoom,At least you can claim to be a delicatesse
19-07-2019T16:51:23,Tharkis,eaten by witches?! but... i like witches! :ctharkis-ewok:
19-07-2019T16:51:28,TeapotOfDoom,3/4 witches recommed
19-07-2019T16:51:30,phil199,Depends how cynical you can get Marv.
19-07-2019T16:51:39,SageSaga,well i would describe these witches as Hags Tharkis
19-07-2019T16:53:47,Tharkis,ah ok
19-07-2019T16:59:32,Kiit0s,hey @Beyxer you don't have any issues with it so far right XD
19-07-2019T17:00:04,SageSaga,my video card comes out in a few days O_O
19-07-2019T17:00:20,Sclimshady,Exiting times
19-07-2019T17:00:21,phil199,Which card are you getting?
19-07-2019T17:00:27,SageSaga,2080 Super
19-07-2019T17:00:43,phil199,"Neat, just ordered my 2070 Super today"
19-07-2019T17:01:32,SageSaga,nice
19-07-2019T17:01:40,SageSaga,Mihari got her card yesterday...
19-07-2019T17:01:50,SageSaga,freakn 2080TI
19-07-2019T17:01:54,Beyxer,"Nope, she looks perfect."
19-07-2019T17:02:29,phil199,"Oh boi, 2080TI is still going strong"
19-07-2019T17:03:00,SageSaga,it's a beast- but it cost waaaay too much for me XD
19-07-2019T17:03:54,phil199,A grand iirc. I paid 570 for mine already and it's too much XD
19-07-2019T17:04:34,SageSaga,the 2080TI is a thousand if you get the most basic one and find it at that price
19-07-2019T17:04:47,SageSaga,but she got the FTW3 Ultra which i think is 1400
19-07-2019T17:05:22,phil199,The best of the best then
19-07-2019T17:06:33,phil199,that's some power package
19-07-2019T17:07:19,SageSaga,and the first game she played after getting it installed. . . City of Heroes
19-07-2019T17:08:52,SageSaga,(if y'all dont get why that is funny- City of Heroes is a really old game that doesnt take much to play it at max- its like getting a Spaceship to drive to the end of your driveway)
19-07-2019T17:09:03,w0lfmare,Purple \o/
19-07-2019T17:10:09,phil199,Some people buy the highest tier rig for some simulators that really don't need much.
19-07-2019T17:10:23,phil199,But as long as you're happy with the rig why not ^^
19-07-2019T17:10:41,SageSaga,she plays other games of course that require a lot more- but shes just been having fun playing CoH again XD
19-07-2019T17:10:51,Oci,"CoH is also offline now, innit?"
19-07-2019T17:11:07,Oci,"Not official servers, anyway"
19-07-2019T17:11:14,SageSaga,yep- no official servers
19-07-2019T17:11:36,PurpleLemons,W0lf \o/
19-07-2019T17:11:50,SageSaga,we play on the Homecoming server
19-07-2019T17:11:57,phil199,I mean it's a way to use it. Sometimes it's just funny tho.
19-07-2019T17:12:08,SageSaga,I made Kaylin and Mihari made Nyna
19-07-2019T17:12:30,SageSaga,also made Lilith and Lien
19-07-2019T17:12:36,Tharkis,i liked COH
19-07-2019T17:12:47,Tharkis,i played DCUO for a while too when COH was gone
19-07-2019T17:13:05,SageSaga,i also made a retarded balor...
19-07-2019T17:13:08,Tharkis,"i could still play DCUO, i've got a lifetime sub, but all my friends who played stopped playing =("
19-07-2019T17:13:23,SageSaga,he's stupid strong. . . no pun intended
19-07-2019T17:14:19,SageSaga,he's based on a D&D campaign
19-07-2019T17:14:31,SageSaga,at the end of the campaign he was like the final boss battle
19-07-2019T17:14:57,SageSaga,but Mihari managed to hit him with a feeblemind spell- and Tom banished him back to Abyss
19-07-2019T17:15:18,SageSaga,so they ended the final battle in less than 1 full round...
19-07-2019T17:16:06,phil199,Sounds impressive?
19-07-2019T17:16:14,Tharkis,hah nice
19-07-2019T17:16:29,Oci,efficient murder-hobos
19-07-2019T17:16:36,Tharkis,and so he got banished to COH and now they're a feebleminded musclehead hero!
19-07-2019T17:16:50,SageSaga,so imagine this- you get to the final boss - he laughs wickedly and prepared to destroy you all- when one of you casts a spell that makes him incredibly dumb- and then another uses a low level spell to send him back to where he came- and its a save that
19-07-2019T17:16:55,SageSaga,just got set to a stat of 1
19-07-2019T17:17:39,SageSaga,and now he wanders hell not knowing who he is or what basic math is...
19-07-2019T17:18:13,phil199,So basically harmless
19-07-2019T17:18:29,Oci,"I did something similar in a different tabletop.  This boss which created a crater the size of a city-block tried to throw me off of my low-flying transport unit, so I cleaved them in two between the entry-rail and the crater's edge"
19-07-2019T17:18:32,SageSaga,he's still incredibly strong XD
19-07-2019T17:19:00,phil199,What use has strength if you dont know how to throw a punch
19-07-2019T17:19:54,SageSaga,punching him sets you on fire sooo
19-07-2019T17:20:28,phil199,That might make it a bit troublesome
19-07-2019T17:20:29,SageSaga,so i turned him into a super hero that basically doesnt know any better- he just runs off to anyone yelling for help
19-07-2019T17:20:50,SageSaga,and people keep attacking him and dying...
19-07-2019T17:21:29,phil199,Help them to help themselves? Good thing with making him a good guy. Especially since the baddies are all killing themselves on that dude.
19-07-2019T17:22:51,SageSaga,"the feeble mind spell leaves people with pretty much an animals intelligence- so they can tell if someone is in trouble and decide to run or ""fight' hes just not good at fighting because he doesnt really know how- so he can like bite people or flail at"
19-07-2019T17:22:52,SageSaga,them
19-07-2019T17:23:53,phil199,With super strength? I can see the people flying from the flailing
19-07-2019T17:26:52,SageSaga,basically- think of a dog with the strength to throw elephants- that sets things on fire and is practically immune to magic and most weapons
19-07-2019T17:27:32,TeapotOfDoom,Does the dog like pets though?
19-07-2019T17:27:33,phil199,What a cool dog. Coudn't you get that thing as some kind of pet if it's as dense as a brick?
19-07-2019T17:27:55,RimaDraws,hmmm
19-07-2019T17:28:37,Kameloh,:ckameloh-naokithinky:
19-07-2019T17:28:56,TeapotOfDoom,Sry I'm to tired to be serious
19-07-2019T17:29:43,SageSaga,Balor like pets but pet too hard and you might spontaneously combust
19-07-2019T17:30:05,RimaDraws,lol
19-07-2019T17:30:18,Kameloh,I'm getting too lazy to paint
19-07-2019T17:30:26,TeapotOfDoom,Man i still haven't managed to try D&D. I keep trying to convince my friends but no luck so far
19-07-2019T17:30:31,SageSaga,come on Kameloh!
19-07-2019T17:30:39,RheyareZeta,take a pizza break kame
19-07-2019T17:30:40,Kameloh,XD
19-07-2019T17:30:40,SageSaga,Dig down deep! Find the strength!
19-07-2019T17:30:44,SageSaga,AND GO!
19-07-2019T17:30:55,RimaDraws,i might get back up and go to streaming again
19-07-2019T17:30:58,RimaDraws,but idk if i want to
19-07-2019T17:30:58,Kameloh,I found this [:ckameloh-frenchbread:]*:ckameloh-naokithinky:

19-07-2019T21:28:24,AspiringNoodle,Oh nuuuuu
19-07-2019T21:28:29,BadFoMo,I call bull crap on that.
19-07-2019T21:28:42,AspiringNoodle,That's a rip run
19-07-2019T21:29:06,RisqueRaptor,Ooo so close
19-07-2019T21:29:31,AspiringNoodle,"Imagine if sonic showed up and was like, ""You're too slooooooow~"""
19-07-2019T21:29:42,AspiringNoodle,And then failed because he was too fast :P
19-07-2019T21:30:00,AspiringNoodle,OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH
19-07-2019T21:30:18,AspiringNoodle,Let me search through my history
19-07-2019T21:30:31,AspiringNoodle,I think the level was either help or save the mushroom
19-07-2019T21:31:12,AspiringNoodle,Vid he was featured in: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ajlmUGVVLo&feature=youtu.be&t=94
19-07-2019T21:31:42,AspiringNoodle,"And can confirm, it's called Rescue the Mushroom :D"
19-07-2019T21:32:23,AspiringNoodle,RIP
19-07-2019T21:32:52,RheyareZeta,this level looks fun
19-07-2019T21:33:10,AspiringNoodle,"I know the name of the game in mario is generally ""run or die"""
19-07-2019T21:33:16,AspiringNoodle,"But this really is ""RUN OR DIE"""
19-07-2019T21:33:57,AspiringNoodle,Nice
19-07-2019T21:34:07,AspiringNoodle,Wanna Rescue the Mushroom? :P
19-07-2019T21:35:32,AspiringNoodle,"I like this level, just the right amount of difficulty"
19-07-2019T21:36:34,AspiringNoodle,*squee*
19-07-2019T21:41:03,RheyareZeta,siiiick
19-07-2019T21:41:16,AspiringNoodle,I'm glad I could share his level <3
19-07-2019T21:41:30,AspiringNoodle,He would NOT stop talking about this game for like the month or two leading up to launch xD
19-07-2019T21:41:35,BadFoMo,I found that amusing.
19-07-2019T21:42:36,AspiringNoodle,I'm amazed ~1/4 of people didn't want to help the mushroom :P
19-07-2019T21:43:18,AspiringNoodle,Thwomps are just imazingly creative :P
19-07-2019T21:43:41,AspiringNoodle,Oh nooooooo
19-07-2019T21:44:03,AspiringNoodle,"Oh yeah, someone recreated a Zelda dungeon in SMM"
19-07-2019T21:44:09,AspiringNoodle,I wonder if its on the same video...
19-07-2019T21:45:39,AspiringNoodle,Spoopy
19-07-2019T21:46:04,AspiringNoodle,That thing was spikey drilley death
19-07-2019T21:46:51,AspiringNoodle,Wait... sooo.... if you reactivate the block while it's falling through them...
19-07-2019T21:47:17,AspiringNoodle,Does that mean a block size chunk of flesh was ripped out of existence from the poor thing and replaced with the block?
19-07-2019T21:49:40,AspiringNoodle,That music is so cute and disarming
19-07-2019T21:49:54,AspiringNoodle,And conflicts with the horrifying nature of the level :D
19-07-2019T21:50:11,AspiringNoodle,"A flesh bag wearing the skeleton of a dead turtle to survive poison, saws, and thwomps"
19-07-2019T21:50:30,BadFoMo,What was with the creepy music?
19-07-2019T21:51:02,AspiringNoodle,"Man, these 20 seconds run right and press a simulators sure are popular"
19-07-2019T21:51:08,AspiringNoodle,RIP

19-07-2019T21:56:07,AspiringNoodle,THE DEKU TREE!
19-07-2019T21:57:06,AspiringNoodle,Hmmmm... is it possible to make a level that would crash all other Switches because the user made aftermarket changes that let it handle the work?
19-07-2019T21:57:14,Combak,No
19-07-2019T21:57:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ll return when I’ve got home

19-07-2019T21:59:24,AspiringNoodle,Awwwwww
19-07-2019T21:59:41,AspiringNoodle,But the shell bouncing around was working with the music so well in that section :(
19-07-2019T21:59:50,Combak,Timer battle. Stand on the spots between red and blue blocks.
