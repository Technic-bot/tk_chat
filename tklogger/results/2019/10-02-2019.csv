10-02-2019T00:32:41,Ordithus,... really? Going to call voters idiots?
10-02-2019T00:32:52,unsteddyphoenix,Always room for more Kat~
10-02-2019T00:32:59,Ordithus,"Kinda rude, y'know"
10-02-2019T00:33:04,RimaDraws,also gotta take off watermarks on my DA tk arts because i got people complaining about them
10-02-2019T00:33:10,TorqueEmUp,Truth is usually pretty rude
10-02-2019T00:33:12,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah I dislike watermarks too
10-02-2019T00:33:25,RimaDraws,well i do it because people edit out signatures
10-02-2019T00:33:37,Bgrmystr2,"if people really wanted to steal your art, they could do it with the deviantart watermark too."
10-02-2019T00:33:43,Bgrmystr2,it's not that difficult
10-02-2019T00:33:44,unsteddyphoenix,yeah but sometimes you just gotta deal with it unfortunetly
10-02-2019T00:33:48,RimaDraws,but im just gonna take it off and not care
10-02-2019T00:33:53,RimaDraws,im just tired of them complaining
10-02-2019T00:34:10,Bgrmystr2,a good idea is to actually put your signature in the background of the picture somewhere in the scenery or somesuch
10-02-2019T00:34:14,Bgrmystr2,where noone would notice.
10-02-2019T00:34:29,RimaDraws,i wish i could....but i have always put mine in the corner...
10-02-2019T00:34:33,Bgrmystr2,implement it as part of the picture lol
10-02-2019T00:35:24,RimaDraws,ill find a way....
10-02-2019T00:35:31,Bgrmystr2,"honestly, I'm sure tom will figure out what he can put on a reference that isn't on the generic pictures that he's drawn of kat"
10-02-2019T00:35:33,RimaDraws,for now art block has me in its dark clutches
10-02-2019T00:36:01,TorqueEmUp,"True, but then it still needs to be colored."

10-02-2019T02:44:51,unsteddyphoenix,Me suck
10-02-2019T02:46:47,Dadrobit,"I had one good game on gebraltar, and it's been a shitstorm ever since."

10-02-2019T02:55:21,Dadrobit,"Investment as in ""time spent trying to figure out how to play on KBM"
10-02-2019T02:55:24,Dadrobit,""""
10-02-2019T02:55:43,Bgrmystr2,it won't take long to adjust honestly
10-02-2019T02:56:21,Bgrmystr2,memorizing what key is what is generally the hardest thing for me
10-02-2019T02:56:59,Bgrmystr2,"but I hear a lot of ppl having issue with the mouse movement, ya just adjust it to a movement speed that's comfortable, then increase it as it begins to feel sluggish"
10-02-2019T02:58:01,Dadrobit,"Hell, I still glance down at the keyboard for general typing, much less twitch reaction inputs."
10-02-2019T03:09:35,unsteddyphoenix,Honestly its easier to play a video game than touch type
10-02-2019T03:09:39,unsteddyphoenix,Switch to pc
10-02-2019T03:09:54,unsteddyphoenix,be a superior master race gamer
10-02-2019T03:11:28,Dadrobit,"Eh, I'm not that far behind KBM on DS4. Used to play a number of fps games that supported KBM on Playstation and still kicked their asses quite handily."
10-02-2019T03:11:41,Bgrmystr2,yeah for FPS on keyboard it's not nearly as reliant on twitch button presses cuz there's very little
10-02-2019T03:11:47,unsteddyphoenix,Youre very far behind trust me
10-02-2019T03:11:53,Dadrobit,"Granted, that was years ago, and I played way too many games"
10-02-2019T03:11:58,unsteddyphoenix,Gotta go to KBM

10-02-2019T03:14:10,Dadrobit,"But again, that was damn near a decade ago."
10-02-2019T03:14:11,unsteddyphoenix,On KBM :OOO
10-02-2019T03:14:18,unsteddyphoenix,The choice is clear

10-02-2019T12:55:10,Twokinds,It was pretty exhausting. But I think it turned out some good sketches.
10-02-2019T12:56:21,iliar,About sketches... looks like Laura tail not connected to body.
10-02-2019T12:56:22,Azumachan,:ctwokinds-kingtea:

10-02-2019T12:57:14,Twokinds,"Okay, I'll look into it."
10-02-2019T12:57:48,Xexanoth,first sketch was the best one...totally not my biased opinion XD
10-02-2019T13:00:47,iliar,"The water looks clear. We can see the buth, but we can't see the tail. https://yadi.sk/i/QCkrsLE7iZ2ChA"

10-02-2019T13:01:09,Twokinds,I just didn't shade it in
10-02-2019T13:02:24,Xexanoth,"i figured she had it around her right leg, because sitting on your tail is probably not comfortable :ptv-wondering:"
10-02-2019T13:03:22,Xexanoth,but given the way she's kinda laying that doesn't actually make too much sense
10-02-2019T13:05:48,iliar,"To be honest, I do not see it. But never mind. This sketch looks good."
10-02-2019T13:17:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Unless I’m looking real hard at it or it’s pointed out I don’t see most of this mess
10-02-2019T13:17:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Kinda looks like it could be deeper in where the water hides it
10-02-2019T13:22:26,SpazztasticKiwi,So Tom you gonna get stuff done today?!?
10-02-2019T13:22:50,Twokinds,I'm going to get all the sketches prepped for the week

10-02-2019T14:09:20,georgiwolf2232,i binge read the comic in three days last sunday the story really dragged me in
10-02-2019T14:10:38,Mippy,XD I’ve been reading it nearly as long as Tom’s been drawing it. It’s a great record of Tom’s progress as both a artist and story teller.
10-02-2019T14:10:56,georgiwolf2232,yeah he upgraded a lot
10-02-2019T14:12:31,Mippy,I mean...his art was not “bad” in the beginning. It’s was just ...he was young and unpolished. It’s shows that a person can improve if they want to And really work at it.
10-02-2019T14:13:17,georgiwolf2232,yea
10-02-2019T14:13:38,Mippy,"Oh, I got to get ready to catch my bus. Later."

10-02-2019T16:05:27,Twokinds,Hi
10-02-2019T16:06:17,TerraTheWizard,Hi
10-02-2019T16:08:53,FennexTheFox,"I missed most of the sketch stream so I'm really surprised at the patron sketch, I love it so much"
10-02-2019T16:09:24,FennexTheFox,The censored ankles are quality
10-02-2019T16:12:11,Twokinds,:D
10-02-2019T16:14:22,Ordithus,This is what happens when your daughters date Keidran!  <3
10-02-2019T16:15:09,Twokinds,lol sounds like a psa
10-02-2019T16:15:12,Twokinds,DON'T. DATE. KEIDRAN!
10-02-2019T16:15:52,ColeRusz,good to know
10-02-2019T16:16:03,Xexanoth,or alternatively it's a positive PSA about breaking changing things for the better...
10-02-2019T16:16:36,Xexanoth,"""This message is brought to you by the ""Keidran are Mates, not Slaves Society"""
10-02-2019T16:16:43,iliar,"Tom, did you have name for Flora's mom?"

10-02-2019T16:17:54,FennexTheFox,"I could totally see there being racist propaganda against dating keidran in the world of twokinds, like how in the real world there were whackjobs against ""race-mixing"""

10-02-2019T16:18:41,Xexanoth,"well, at least they couldn't argue about race-mixing until the Masks lifted the ban"

10-02-2019T16:19:16,Xexanoth,so that's a whole new thing the Templars are going to have to fight
10-02-2019T16:20:05,FennexTheFox,Trace don't care
10-02-2019T16:20:09,FennexTheFox,He got tiger booty
10-02-2019T16:20:22,Twokinds,The situation is kind of complicated and weird.
10-02-2019T16:20:32,Ordithus,The ultimate booty
10-02-2019T16:20:43,Twokinds,in the Twokinds world it's sort of an unwritten understanding that relations happen all the time.
10-02-2019T16:20:51,Twokinds,But you're not supposed to say it.
10-02-2019T16:21:11,FennexTheFox,"Hmm, that makes sense"
10-02-2019T16:21:19,Twokinds,"And it's not really seen as true romance or anything. No one considers it love, and if they did, that'd be considered immoral."
10-02-2019T16:21:22,Ordithus,[It is improper in polite society]*:ctwokinds-kingtea:
10-02-2019T16:21:33,Xexanoth,"""The situation is kind of complicated and weird."" That's the subtitle for TwoKinds right?"

10-02-2019T16:22:07,Ordithus,Hence Rose's reaction to learning that Trace was serious about Flora

10-02-2019T16:42:31,Twokinds,I have to wait until it grows out more.
10-02-2019T16:42:35,Twokinds,It's annoying.
10-02-2019T16:42:47,TerraTheWizard,oh no
10-02-2019T16:42:48,FennexTheFox,That sounds painful
10-02-2019T16:43:16,Twokinds,"Not painful, but it keeps catching on stuff because one side is cracked."
10-02-2019T16:43:31,Twokinds,But I can't clip it off because it's too deep.
10-02-2019T16:44:23,BadFoMo,Trim ALL nails down to the bace?
10-02-2019T16:44:35,BadFoMo,...Never mind.

10-02-2019T17:14:46,Ordithus,The strata of the incredible amount of snow is interesting
10-02-2019T17:24:06,RimaDraws,Hmm
10-02-2019T17:30:11,Ordithus,Especially towards the road.  The layers of grungy snow between the clean snow
10-02-2019T17:30:27,Ordithus,Like sedimentary rock
10-02-2019T17:30:59,CommanderTrace,Hello :ptv-greetings:

10-02-2019T22:28:46,TorqueEmUp,"Apex Legends, new free to play Battle Royale game."
10-02-2019T22:29:06,TorqueEmUp,"Basically a middle ground between PUBG, and Fortnite."
10-02-2019T22:29:38,RimaDraws,oooh ok
10-02-2019T22:30:12,TorqueEmUp,"I am only interested because it takes place in the Titanfall Universe, and I played a crap ton of Titanfall 2 for a while."
10-02-2019T22:30:53,TorqueEmUp,So Battle Royale Titanfall without Titans is how I understand it.
10-02-2019T22:31:14,TorqueEmUp,But I have REALLY looked into it much.
10-02-2019T22:33:13,TorqueEmUp,Haven't*
10-02-2019T22:42:17,RimaDraws,hm sounds interesting but i am not interested in anything fortnite related.
10-02-2019T22:54:00,RimaDraws,i tried fortnite and it was a bust
10-02-2019T23:02:41,TorqueEmUp,The Building mechanic really turned me off of Fortnite.
