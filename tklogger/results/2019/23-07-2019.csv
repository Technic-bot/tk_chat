23-07-2019T13:10:44,CrRAR,"How noble of them, lol"
23-07-2019T13:11:09,AspiringNoodle,"I'm telling you, a day of reckoning is coming"
23-07-2019T13:11:27,AspiringNoodle,"These companies WILL pay for how predatory their microtransactions are getting, if you can even call them that anymore >_."
23-07-2019T13:11:50,AspiringNoodle,"If you have an in-game purchase worth more than the base game itself, YOU NO LONGER HAVE THE RIGHT TO CALL IT ""MICRO"" ANYTHING"
23-07-2019T13:18:12,AspiringNoodle,"Oh boy, the 3900X shortage is now being written about in articles"
23-07-2019T13:18:22,AspiringNoodle,"That ain't good for me, great for AMD, though"
23-07-2019T13:32:30,CrRAR,"Yeahhh, microtransactions. When they've vacuumed up all the money, us peasants can just resort to trading bottle caps, right?"
23-07-2019T13:40:42,AspiringNoodle,Let's not forgot that developers don't see a god damned cent of that money
23-07-2019T13:40:52,AspiringNoodle,It all goes into the publisher's coffers and the executives pockets
23-07-2019T13:47:56,CrRAR,"Yeah, the devs literally probably have to trade what little creative freedom they have for a direct conduit into the pockets of their fans. ;_;"
23-07-2019T13:51:27,CrRAR,"""Oh you want to make a wholesome, innovative game that your fans will love? It better make us more money than MundaneWarfare 2019 ever did."""
23-07-2019T13:53:11,AspiringNoodle,"More or less, ALWAYS be wary of games coming from a studio backed by a publisher"
23-07-2019T13:53:42,AspiringNoodle,It seems to be inevitable that the publisher will ultimately become a greedy powerhouse trying to please investors.
23-07-2019T14:22:38,TeapotOfDoom,Well color me surprised if there will ever be enough backlash to solve this problem. Call me pessimistic but Apple never saw the consequences of their actions either
23-07-2019T14:23:34,TeapotOfDoom,These companies have a history of not caring about either the consumer or the dev. They don't need to. People buy it anyway
23-07-2019T14:25:27,TeapotOfDoom,In this case i hope that the governments of the different countries will be the ones to act on it. Cause it involves obvious gambling
23-07-2019T14:29:12,AspiringNoodle,"There's a reason hardcore enthusiasts hate ""normies"""
23-07-2019T14:29:21,AspiringNoodle,They will eat any shit thrown their way without a second thought
23-07-2019T14:29:58,AspiringNoodle,"For the true gamers who actually give a damn, there's a joke floating around"
23-07-2019T14:30:47,AspiringNoodle,It goes something like this
23-07-2019T14:31:12,AspiringNoodle,"When it came to buying games, it used to be ""Wait for the reviews."""
23-07-2019T14:31:22,AspiringNoodle,"Then it became, ""Wait for launch"""
23-07-2019T14:31:28,AspiringNoodle,"Then ""Wait a few weeks"""
23-07-2019T14:31:35,AspiringNoodle,"Now it's becoming ""Wait a few months"""
23-07-2019T14:31:44,AspiringNoodle,"Soon, it'll be ""Wait forever"" ;)"
23-07-2019T14:37:01,CrRAR,Haha
23-07-2019T14:39:27,AspiringNoodle,It's a sad reality of the gaming industry
23-07-2019T14:39:50,AspiringNoodle,"It used to be you could trust the word of reviewers from gaming outlets, but then they became more interested in their agendas than actual reviews"
23-07-2019T14:40:02,AspiringNoodle,"Also, they can't play for shit :ptv-laugh:"
23-07-2019T14:40:33,AspiringNoodle,"So next, they advised waiting for launch, see what actual players who paid for the game said about it"
23-07-2019T14:41:23,AspiringNoodle,Then games started taking advantage of online connections to push out broken games and fix them later
23-07-2019T14:41:53,AspiringNoodle,"And now, if that wasn't bad enough, thanks to publishers like Activision, we have to wait MONTHS to know how badly a game's gonna screw over it's customers"
23-07-2019T14:42:10,AspiringNoodle,"It took 6 months, but they added super predatory microtransactions to Black Ops 4."
23-07-2019T14:42:47,AspiringNoodle,"Not only did they incorporate loot boxes into the game, they also added P2W elements.  Recently, a 2nd gun exclusive to loot boxes was released with the same problem as the other one"
23-07-2019T14:43:02,AspiringNoodle,The guns are so overpowered that they're effectively 1-shot kills.  And you can only get them through paid means
23-07-2019T14:44:17,AspiringNoodle,"These kinds of overpowered guns will get nerfed eventually, but essentially you can just keep pulling the lever until you get a gun that hands you a serious advantage."
23-07-2019T14:44:58,AspiringNoodle,"So yeah... not publishers are likely going to start waiting months until they drop all the predatory crap into their games.  Get the good will and good reviews cemented, then pull the wool."
23-07-2019T14:53:15,AspiringNoodle,"Ugh, I swear, I'm just sick of predatory business practices going unpunished :ptv-unimpressed:"
23-07-2019T17:41:20,AspiringNoodle,"well, my sanity is nearing shreds at this point"
23-07-2019T17:41:37,AspiringNoodle,Anybody got some good news or funny stories to help preserve my mental health? :ptv-hearts:
23-07-2019T17:57:39,CrRAR,"Well, the largest jumping spider I've ever seen spun a nest in my mailbox and is living there now with about 1000 of its babies."
23-07-2019T17:58:19,CrRAR,I've never seen so many fidgety little dots!

23-07-2019T17:58:52,AspiringNoodle,"Awwww, spider babies! :ptv-excited:"

23-07-2019T18:00:13,CrRAR,It quickly abandoned them when I opened the box up.
23-07-2019T18:00:33,AspiringNoodle,"If one day you come out to your ""mailbox"" and all you find is your mail on a pile of ashes.  You know somebody did you a favor and killed it with fire."

23-07-2019T19:02:59,Bgrmystr2,so.... technically..? :ptv-wondering:
23-07-2019T19:03:04,Bgrmystr2,I think.
23-07-2019T19:03:12,Sclimshady,How much is rent?
23-07-2019T19:03:16,IronHorseComics,"hey I'm just try'n to be real, I work on my own webcomic"
23-07-2019T19:03:24,Bgrmystr2,"There is no rent, surprisingly."
23-07-2019T19:03:33,Bgrmystr2,We have to fix everything ourselves though.
23-07-2019T19:03:49,Sclimshady,Avery affordable fixer upper
23-07-2019T19:03:52,IronHorseComics,and there's an annoying cat that keeps eating the snacks
23-07-2019T19:03:56,Sclimshady,A very*
23-07-2019T19:04:11,Bgrmystr2,yeah and that dude that leaves a hole in the ceiling to join the chat..
23-07-2019T19:04:16,Bgrmystr2,and the front door is ALWAYS broken.
23-07-2019T19:04:25,Bgrmystr2,Always.
23-07-2019T19:05:14,Bgrmystr2,We also have a jar of nickles every time someone suggests an image is going to be a shoe-in for getting colored
23-07-2019T19:05:17,SomeNiceUser,"I kinda have a good grasp on what I want, but on paper... It’s very, very vague."
23-07-2019T19:07:24,IronHorseComics,"keep working on it and don't be afraid to bounce ideas around with other people that you know, that can be very helpful"
23-07-2019T19:07:36,SomeNiceUser,I made brownies.
23-07-2019T19:09:19,SomeNiceUser,"Horse, that’s a great idea."
23-07-2019T19:11:17,IronHorseComics,"trust me, I know from personal experience. One of the best things they can do is rein you in if a story concept is a bit too far or too absurd. Got a guy who pulled me back from a couple of very, very dark ideas that would have been too traumatizing"
23-07-2019T19:11:21,IronHorseComics,to the characters
23-07-2019T19:12:58,SomeNiceUser,"I remember something about a friend and I jokingly said:“let's make a comic that’s looks innocent but gets darker the further it goes.” Kinda of a far fetched idea though, but considering it."
23-07-2019T19:13:23,SomeNiceUser,That idea just stuck to me.
23-07-2019T19:14:17,SomeNiceUser,Kinda like REzero
23-07-2019T19:15:12,TeapotOfDoom,Evening peeps :ctwokinds-kingtea:
23-07-2019T19:15:37,TeapotOfDoom,busts through the broken front door
23-07-2019T19:15:50,SomeNiceUser,"Hello teapot, I’m just a new resident of this chat."
23-07-2019T19:16:48,Bgrmystr2,"Remember, to be a resident, you have to live here. And most people do not live here. They come here often to hang out, but they are not residents."
23-07-2019T19:17:05,TeapotOfDoom,Hi there! Read your intentions of a webcomic. Nice idea. But i can support the others be prepared for a lot of work
23-07-2019T19:17:56,TeapotOfDoom,I don't know if qualifying for resident would be good or bad
23-07-2019T19:18:22,SomeNiceUser,There is benefits.
23-07-2019T19:18:42,SomeNiceUser,Yet... there is consequences.
23-07-2019T19:18:51,TeapotOfDoom,Do i get a discount for stuff?
23-07-2019T19:18:51,SomeNiceUser,Yes?
23-07-2019T19:19:19,TeapotOfDoom,As a resident
23-07-2019T19:20:32,SomeNiceUser,:ptv-uneasy: I-I don’t know...
23-07-2019T19:20:45,Bgrmystr2,"There are some requirements to be qualified as a resident, but there are only two types. Permanant and temporary."
23-07-2019T19:21:10,Bgrmystr2,"Those like myself, Permanant residents, have the chat open in a window which allows us to both lurk and read all messages all the time that happen even when we are away."
23-07-2019T19:21:34,Bgrmystr2,We know everything. We see.. everything. :eyes:
23-07-2019T19:22:07,Bgrmystr2,"Others, like the temporary residents, are not always here but usually come here during their free time after work or school, or when they are not sleeping."
23-07-2019T19:22:33,Bgrmystr2,"Most people only come by for the streams, so they can't be called residents."
23-07-2019T19:23:18,SomeNiceUser,I think the term for them is called regular visitors.
23-07-2019T19:23:21,Bgrmystr2,"You are free to be whatever you wish, there is no pressure what so ever. :)"
23-07-2019T19:24:28,Bgrmystr2,":ptv-SteelwormHades: Just know that some of us live here. The ears have eyes, or something or other."
23-07-2019T19:24:29,SomeNiceUser,I guess I apply to temporary residents.
23-07-2019T19:25:01,Bgrmystr2,Welcome to the fold then. :ptv-greetings:
23-07-2019T19:26:35,SomeNiceUser,I made brownies recently.
23-07-2019T19:26:47,TeapotOfDoom,Brownies are love
23-07-2019T19:26:50,TeapotOfDoom,Also
23-07-2019T19:27:10,TeapotOfDoom,"If someone follows spacex, starhopper webcast just went live"
23-07-2019T19:28:04,SomeNiceUser,Interesting.
23-07-2019T19:28:53,AspiringNoodle,Nice to meet SNU :ptv-hearts:
23-07-2019T19:29:11,AspiringNoodle,I am a fellow [new] permanent resident.
23-07-2019T19:29:15,AspiringNoodle,(I have no life)
23-07-2019T19:29:27,AspiringNoodle,I like talking with other fans of the comic.
23-07-2019T19:29:27,SomeNiceUser,Hello Noodle!:ptv-greetings:
23-07-2019T19:29:30,IronHorseComics,"wonder what would happen if an anthro character went to a furry convention, would they pretend to be in a fur suit to troll everone or flat out admit they're real"
23-07-2019T19:29:32,AspiringNoodle,(I have no irl friends)
23-07-2019T19:30:29,SomeNiceUser,Depending if they want to attract attention.
23-07-2019T19:30:33,AspiringNoodle,I'm just sitting around waiting for certain computer parts to become available :3
23-07-2019T19:30:42,AspiringNoodle,(I'm procrastinating drawing practice)
23-07-2019T19:31:22,SomeNiceUser,"I would love to get a pc for drawing, but it’s very expensive."
23-07-2019T19:31:25,AspiringNoodle,And that's my impersonation of an anime character faking it vs their inner voice telling the truth :P
23-07-2019T19:31:27,IronHorseComics,"I can imagine a person in a fur suit going up to them saying ""I love your costume, it looks so real"""

23-07-2019T19:33:23,Bgrmystr2,or an entirely different chat.

23-07-2019T19:37:50,Bgrmystr2,wasn't that a movie
23-07-2019T19:37:57,IronHorseComics,no it was a TV show
23-07-2019T19:38:12,IronHorseComics,the best one they had until the Ducktales Reboot came
23-07-2019T19:38:27,SomeNiceUser,"What pc would be great for me, I would like it to be fast, but cheap."
23-07-2019T19:38:29,Bgrmystr2,oh the movie was just Gravity

23-07-2019T19:38:57,AspiringNoodle,Straight up will recomment the R5 3600 from Ryzen.  Best $200 cpu on the market

23-07-2019T19:39:52,Bgrmystr2,oh it's that thing
23-07-2019T19:39:54,Bgrmystr2,also aaaaalink
23-07-2019T19:40:02,AspiringNoodle,...I approve this link :ptv-excited:
23-07-2019T19:40:44,IronHorseComics,I'm so glad the executive's plan to sabotage the show failed and it ran to its completion
23-07-2019T19:41:19,IronHorseComics,"apparantly the execs hated it so they would put it in awful showing times, worked so well with Symbionic Titan"
23-07-2019T19:42:03,IronHorseComics,but Gravity Falls was too good and too funny for the plans to work
23-07-2019T19:42:31,AspiringNoodle,"Awww, I liked that show"
23-07-2019T19:42:36,SomeNiceUser,It was a masterpiece.
23-07-2019T19:43:06,IronHorseComics,"I did too, and it was cancelled on a stupid cliffhanger AAAARRRG!"
23-07-2019T19:44:07,AspiringNoodle,Let's not forget
23-07-2019T19:44:14,AspiringNoodle,The twerking scene :ptv-sneakysmirk:
23-07-2019T19:45:24,IronHorseComics,and the street race
23-07-2019T19:45:54,IronHorseComics,would have been better with eurobeats but oh well

23-07-2019T19:50:34,IronHorseComics,and yet it was understandable
23-07-2019T19:51:47,IronHorseComics,"growing up without his parents, being bullied in military training by other cadets, being framed for a crimes he was trying to stop"
23-07-2019T19:51:58,IronHorseComics,kinda hard for the guy to be upbeat
23-07-2019T19:54:57,TeapotOfDoom,Gravity falls was bullied out of existance?
23-07-2019T19:55:18,IronHorseComics,"no, it completed it's main story"
23-07-2019T19:55:22,TeapotOfDoom,I didn't even know... it was such a brilliant show
23-07-2019T19:55:39,SomeNiceUser,At least the story reached its
23-07-2019T19:55:45,TeapotOfDoom,Yes but i didn't know that they tried
23-07-2019T19:55:46,Sclimshady,I think Gravity falls came to a logical conclusion.  They didn't want it to lose quality
23-07-2019T19:55:48,SomeNiceUser,Conclusion
23-07-2019T19:55:56,AspiringNoodle,Mabel is a horrible person. Fite me
23-07-2019T19:56:19,IronHorseComics,"of course she is, she's a pre-teen"

23-07-2019T19:58:01,SomeNiceUser,I found my old 3DS.
23-07-2019T19:58:07,IronHorseComics,[terrified quack]
23-07-2019T19:58:25,Sclimshady,I had a gameboy color :cw0lfmare-PaperemberClose:
23-07-2019T19:58:35,TeapotOfDoom,Still got ma dsi
23-07-2019T19:58:44,TeapotOfDoom,Good times
23-07-2019T19:59:00,Sclimshady,And that was after my og gameboy
23-07-2019T19:59:34,SomeNiceUser,"My younger brother had a broken 3DS, he wanted to sell it for 5$."
23-07-2019T19:59:53,SomeNiceUser,So I bought it.
23-07-2019T20:00:01,TeapotOfDoom,Did you fix it?
23-07-2019T20:00:36,SomeNiceUser,Turns out that the battery was defective.
23-07-2019T20:01:07,SomeNiceUser,So now I have two 3DS!
23-07-2019T20:01:14,AspiringNoodle,"Oh yeah, did you guys hear about Big O?"
23-07-2019T20:01:41,TeapotOfDoom,Big o?
23-07-2019T20:01:49,IronHorseComics,nope
23-07-2019T20:01:54,SomeNiceUser,What’s that?
23-07-2019T20:02:19,Sclimshady,Ovorce?
23-07-2019T20:02:52,TeapotOfDoom,Overpriced?
23-07-2019T20:03:00,AspiringNoodle,"Ofc, I'm not referring to the classic animated series, The Big O."
23-07-2019T20:03:15,AspiringNoodle,"I'm referring, instead, to Origin PC's new custom monster, Big O."
23-07-2019T20:03:24,AspiringNoodle,An all-in-one system in every sense
23-07-2019T20:03:24,TeapotOfDoom,O
23-07-2019T20:03:30,AspiringNoodle,"One computer, EVERY gaming platform."
23-07-2019T20:03:37,AspiringNoodle,"PC, Switch, Xbox One, PS4."
23-07-2019T20:03:48,TeapotOfDoom,In one system?
23-07-2019T20:03:53,AspiringNoodle,In
23-07-2019T20:03:54,AspiringNoodle,One
23-07-2019T20:03:56,AspiringNoodle,System
23-07-2019T20:03:59,TeapotOfDoom,Why
23-07-2019T20:04:06,Bgrmystr2,why not?
23-07-2019T20:04:19,Sclimshady,Why not just release all titles on PC?
23-07-2019T20:04:25,TeapotOfDoom,Switch is a nvidia tegra = arm based
23-07-2019T20:04:27,AspiringNoodle,"""Fuck you, because we can!"""
23-07-2019T20:04:29,Bgrmystr2,because consoles are shit and won't always release on PC?
23-07-2019T20:04:39,AspiringNoodle,I imagine that's their reasoning xD
23-07-2019T20:04:41,Bgrmystr2,There isn't always a PC release.
23-07-2019T20:04:53,Bgrmystr2,which is sad cuz that only guarantees the console's survival.
23-07-2019T20:05:00,AspiringNoodle,Microsoft is starting to push towards PC inclusivity
23-07-2019T20:05:05,TeapotOfDoom,Everything else is x86 as far as i know
23-07-2019T20:05:36,Bgrmystr2,"anycase, the new tower for all the systems is damn good, water cooled, meaning you can probably get overclocking potentially on the consoles"
23-07-2019T20:05:44,Bgrmystr2,"so it'd be better than any individual console is, period."
23-07-2019T20:06:16,TeapotOfDoom,Fun fact you can buy tegra dev kits which is essentially a switch
23-07-2019T20:06:19,Bgrmystr2,"granted overclocking is just a possibility, not guaranteed."
23-07-2019T20:06:42,TeapotOfDoom,I wonder if anyone made that happen
23-07-2019T20:07:11,SomeNiceUser,They’ll find a way.
23-07-2019T20:09:03,TeapotOfDoom,Doesn't look like anyone pulled that one of... i had faith in the hacking community
23-07-2019T20:11:21,SomeNiceUser,My 3DS still works like a charm.
23-07-2019T20:11:58,TeapotOfDoom,Yo bgr ar  you really always on?
23-07-2019T20:12:34,SomeNiceUser,"And I still have my DS games. Heartgold, good times."
23-07-2019T20:12:46,AspiringNoodle,"Idk about him, but I always keep chat open because since quitting WoW I lost my chatting community ._."
23-07-2019T20:13:08,AspiringNoodle,"And I'm slow to adopt new tech, so Discord is still rather foreign to me"
23-07-2019T20:14:53,SomeNiceUser,"When it comes to adapting to new things, I’m pretty fast at it. Mastering it, it takes far longer for me to rise up the curb."
23-07-2019T20:15:44,SomeNiceUser,Like new video games!
23-07-2019T20:16:30,AspiringNoodle,I should use discord more :3
23-07-2019T20:16:45,AspiringNoodle,Find a nice community with a general chat
23-07-2019T20:16:58,SomeNiceUser,I use discord pretty often.
23-07-2019T20:18:44,TeapotOfDoom,Tk community seems to use the stream chat pretty heavily. I have to admit i'd much rather use this then dc
23-07-2019T20:19:13,SomeNiceUser,"I bought a wolf link amiibo from a Walmart a few months ago, lucky find"
23-07-2019T20:19:28,TeapotOfDoom,I'm here when i'm off work but i'd never keep it open all the time ^^
23-07-2019T20:20:10,TeapotOfDoom,Super mario odyssey just started pushing amiibos in my face
23-07-2019T20:21:11,SomeNiceUser,That’s just sad.
23-07-2019T20:21:21,TeapotOfDoom,Anyway it's unbelievably late. I'm heading to bed. Night peeps :ctwokinds-RainezZz:

23-07-2019T20:34:16,SomeNiceUser,I’m still trying to figure out why is Raine’s eyes are glowing.
23-07-2019T20:37:41,SomeNiceUser,Maybe something lit up in her.
23-07-2019T20:40:45,SomeNiceUser,I think I’m just gonna read some fanfics.

23-07-2019T21:12:17,Bgrmystr2,still dunno why Raine is any more special than anyone else.
23-07-2019T21:12:41,SomeNiceUser,Rains must be special in a way.
23-07-2019T21:12:47,Sclimshady,Because Raine is best girl. :ctwokinds-rainehappy:
23-07-2019T21:13:03,SomeNiceUser,Yes shady.
23-07-2019T21:13:29,Bgrmystr2,"One opinion does not a fact make, and nonetheless, that doesn't give any reason at all."
23-07-2019T21:14:16,Sclimshady,Oh im well aware its only an opinion.  But as a flawed human being i believe mine to be the most right
23-07-2019T21:14:48,Bgrmystr2,huhu
23-07-2019T21:15:21,Sclimshady,"Also she's just so kind and trusting after constantly being tossed away, so she must be protected"
23-07-2019T21:15:30,Bgrmystr2,Eh.
23-07-2019T21:15:41,Bgrmystr2,All are equal.
23-07-2019T21:17:00,Sclimshady,But some are more equal than others. :ctwokinds-keith8D:
23-07-2019T21:17:24,Bgrmystr2,"that's not how equal works, and in fact only distorts it so there is no equality."
23-07-2019T21:17:31,Bgrmystr2,which is the very problem to begin with.
23-07-2019T21:18:04,Sclimshady,Thats the point of the statement.  It's entirely nonsensical

23-07-2019T21:30:30,SomeNiceUser,"Raine might have unstable magic after being magically suppressed for years. Which is why she has trouble shifting, and has trouble with her emotions."
23-07-2019T21:32:01,SomeNiceUser,Which means spontaneous floof.
23-07-2019T21:32:16,SpazztasticKiwi,🛌

23-07-2019T21:33:28,Sclimshady,Spontaneous floof is the best floof
23-07-2019T21:34:29,SomeNiceUser,I cherish every moment of spontaneous floof.
23-07-2019T21:34:48,Bgrmystr2,Her magic is unlikely to be unstable due to it being supressed
23-07-2019T21:34:54,Bgrmystr2,"that's not how it works, far as I understand"
23-07-2019T21:35:06,Sclimshady,It is lack of training
23-07-2019T21:35:17,Bgrmystr2,"She, herself, has unstable control over it due to lack of education"
23-07-2019T21:35:26,Sclimshady,^ aye
23-07-2019T21:35:41,Ordithus,Or she's just bad at magic
23-07-2019T21:35:44,SomeNiceUser,Which means she need to learn the art of magic.
23-07-2019T21:35:49,Bgrmystr2,Which is what I said ord XD

23-07-2019T21:36:29,Bgrmystr2,I'd fix it.
23-07-2019T21:36:38,Sclimshady,:ctwokinds-LauraCry: (imagine this is Raine)
23-07-2019T21:36:59,Bgrmystr2,Everyone has to learn magic from some point
23-07-2019T21:37:08,Bgrmystr2,Just because She's at the starting point does not mean it's a bad thing.
23-07-2019T21:37:41,Ordithus,Maybe she's been practicing for years.  And has no talent!
23-07-2019T21:37:53,Bgrmystr2,"With that amulet, and then the shackle?"
23-07-2019T21:37:56,Bgrmystr2,yeah not buyin it
23-07-2019T21:37:58,Sclimshady,She's the Ember of TK?
23-07-2019T21:38:00,Ordithus,Excuses
23-07-2019T21:38:08,SomeNiceUser,"She is very interested in magic though, make me wonder why Raine did not learn any real magic."
23-07-2019T21:38:21,Bgrmystr2,that was explained in the story
23-07-2019T21:38:22,Sclimshady,She wasn't allowed
23-07-2019T21:38:39,Bgrmystr2,her mom hid her and prevented it by using supression magic
23-07-2019T21:38:44,Bgrmystr2,never told her about it
23-07-2019T21:39:28,SomeNiceUser,You are right about that.
23-07-2019T21:40:05,Bgrmystr2,Her introduction and subsequent travels with Team B are what allowed her to experience and experiment
23-07-2019T21:40:19,Bgrmystr2,"for the first time, probably"
23-07-2019T21:40:48,Sclimshady,She ran into them literally right after she was freed as a slave
23-07-2019T21:40:55,Bgrmystr2,yeah
23-07-2019T21:41:49,Sclimshady,"Honestly that freed then meet timeline had me confused for a bit, I originally thought it was a few months after."
23-07-2019T21:41:55,SomeNiceUser,Although she got released at a young age with her mother.
23-07-2019T21:42:11,Sclimshady,At 18
23-07-2019T21:44:26,SomeNiceUser,Then how did she get to Lynknoll?
23-07-2019T21:45:26,Sclimshady,"Before she was sold into slavery, oh wait, thats on me for misreading that"
23-07-2019T21:45:55,Bgrmystr2,"Her mother was originally Grand Templar, but I don't recall if she said she's been there or know it exists."
23-07-2019T21:46:44,Ordithus,Raine hasn't always told the whole story in one go... she mentioned Lyn'knoll well after the story of her slavery http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/602/
23-07-2019T21:46:45,Sclimshady,"I believe her and Mary lived there for a bit, I don't know why they left though"
23-07-2019T21:47:19,Bgrmystr2,Ah there it is then
23-07-2019T21:47:26,Bgrmystr2,yeah probably during Trace's reign
23-07-2019T21:47:55,Ordithus,She relayed her escape from slavery after she was first woofified in front of the others
23-07-2019T21:48:06,SomeNiceUser,She has probably left for personal reasons I suppose.
23-07-2019T21:48:40,Sclimshady,Her mom still never liked Keidren even after being one for a bit so that might be why
23-07-2019T21:49:01,SomeNiceUser,She left for revenge?
23-07-2019T21:49:17,Ordithus,My theory is that's when Neutral approached her
23-07-2019T21:50:06,Bgrmystr2,possibly
23-07-2019T21:50:13,Bgrmystr2,that would make sense

23-07-2019T21:50:37,SomeNiceUser,Like this
23-07-2019T21:51:57,SomeNiceUser,"Although these sketches are small, they provide insights in the comic itself."
23-07-2019T21:51:57,Bgrmystr2,Yeah like that.
23-07-2019T21:52:14,Ordithus,At least in the sketches Raine was quite a bit younger when Euchre rescued her and Mary https://www.deviantart.com/twokinds/art/The-Breakout-790161779
23-07-2019T21:52:51,Bgrmystr2,"Ignoring the ""Nothing / Everything is canon"" running joke, the requests that are specifically about events that happened in the past of the comic you can probably take as canon."
23-07-2019T21:52:56,SomeNiceUser,I’d give it 6-8 years before meeting group b
23-07-2019T21:53:35,Bgrmystr2,suddenly deviantart is pitch black instead of it's nice cool forest green
23-07-2019T21:53:37,Bgrmystr2,well then.
23-07-2019T21:53:38,Ordithus,It does fit with the comic http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/729/
23-07-2019T21:53:56,SomeNiceUser,"Yes, it does."

23-07-2019T21:57:46,Bgrmystr2,Windows 7
23-07-2019T21:58:00,Ordithus,Might be a glitch. Could be that ancient FireFox you are running
23-07-2019T21:58:24,SomeNiceUser,That is certainly a good reason.
23-07-2019T21:58:26,Ordithus,Is that pre v3?
23-07-2019T21:58:27,Bgrmystr2,52.9.0 ESR
23-07-2019T21:58:39,Bgrmystr2,before they removed the ability for people to make actual good addons
23-07-2019T21:58:42,Bgrmystr2,so I said fuckem
23-07-2019T21:58:46,Bgrmystr2,and stopped updating
23-07-2019T21:58:52,Ordithus,That'd explain the look
23-07-2019T21:59:04,Ordithus,Not nearly as old as I thought tho
23-07-2019T21:59:12,Bgrmystr2,I use Waterfox now because they actually value the users unlike Firefox who is now just trying to be Chromefox.
23-07-2019T21:59:27,Bgrmystr2,Both browsers have uses though
23-07-2019T21:59:28,Ordithus,Shiney vulpine
