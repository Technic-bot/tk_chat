31-07-2019T04:26:03,AspiringNoodle,Love newegg reviews where people give a product a 1-egg review
31-07-2019T04:26:21,AspiringNoodle,And it's because their stupid ass didn't bother to check the dimensions of the product before buying it!
31-07-2019T04:26:40,AspiringNoodle,"""I bought this super big video card but it doesn't fit in my case!"""

31-07-2019T14:00:04,TeapotOfDoom,Hey Quill!
31-07-2019T14:00:26,TeapotOfDoom,Hows everyone doing?
31-07-2019T14:00:58,CrimsonQuill,Ok
31-07-2019T14:01:08,CrimsonQuill,Although I am going to miss the stream this weekend.
31-07-2019T14:01:28,CrimsonQuill,I will be going up to my aunt's tomorrow-where there is no internet.
31-07-2019T14:01:36,CrimsonQuill,So that's happening.
31-07-2019T14:01:43,CrimsonQuill,So how are you Teapot?
31-07-2019T14:09:14,TeapotOfDoom,Fine fighting with the hotel wifi
31-07-2019T14:09:32,CrimsonQuill,XD
31-07-2019T14:09:58,TeapotOfDoom,Bought some one punch man manga i found in a store because why not
31-07-2019T14:10:35,TeapotOfDoom,Tomorrow we're driving into the middle of nowhere which i'll use for star photography
31-07-2019T14:11:02,CrimsonQuill,"Oh god, stargazing!"
31-07-2019T14:11:13,TeapotOfDoom,Yes me is excited
31-07-2019T14:11:22,CrimsonQuill,It's been ages since I did proper stargazing and thought Spacey thoughts...
31-07-2019T14:11:38,CrimsonQuill,Hahaha...go to space...wanna be in space...Space!
31-07-2019T14:11:41,CrimsonQuill,SPAAACE1
31-07-2019T14:11:55,TeapotOfDoom,Long time since i've been at a place where you can see the milky way
31-07-2019T14:12:01,TeapotOfDoom,S P A C E
31-07-2019T14:12:51,TeapotOfDoom,Also i need anime recommendations. A few good one that aren't uber weird or extremly long
31-07-2019T14:14:31,TeapotOfDoom,Are you far away enough from civilization to go stargazing when you're at your aunts?
31-07-2019T14:14:51,CrimsonQuill,I suppose so
31-07-2019T14:15:03,CrimsonQuill,"I mean, it's quite rural"
31-07-2019T14:15:14,CrimsonQuill,Just a few houses here and there
31-07-2019T14:15:20,CrimsonQuill,It's farm country
31-07-2019T14:15:39,CrimsonQuill,"If the skies are clear...ohohohoho, I could see forever!"
31-07-2019T14:16:07,CrimsonQuill,The only problem is making sure I have a place to read Twokinds in the evenings before bed without anyone coming to disturb me.
31-07-2019T14:16:26,CrimsonQuill,I'll be bringing my Volumes 3 and 4 with me.
31-07-2019T14:16:30,CrimsonQuill,Also...DRAWING
31-07-2019T14:16:37,CrimsonQuill,SO MUCH DRAWING I hope
31-07-2019T14:16:54,CrimsonQuill,My mum's ordered me to take a break off study while we're up there too.
31-07-2019T14:21:25,TeapotOfDoom,Seems like a good idea if you ask me. I still have to finish an order for work (which i might do tonigh) but anything else on hold for me until i come back
31-07-2019T14:22:12,TeapotOfDoom,I checked the light pollution map for the place we're at and it seems decent. I hope the weather plays along
31-07-2019T14:22:23,CrimsonQuill,Me too.
31-07-2019T14:22:33,TeapotOfDoom,Oh you got the print edition?
31-07-2019T14:22:39,CrimsonQuill,Yep
31-07-2019T14:22:43,CrimsonQuill,A year ago
31-07-2019T14:22:43,TeapotOfDoom,Nice
31-07-2019T14:22:45,CrimsonQuill,Hardback
31-07-2019T14:22:49,CrimsonQuill,Volumes 1-4
31-07-2019T14:22:54,TeapotOfDoom,Ohh premium
31-07-2019T14:23:00,CrimsonQuill,I got a signed Raine print
31-07-2019T14:23:19,TeapotOfDoom,Cool
31-07-2019T14:23:22,CrimsonQuill,She watches from my bedside table-full view of my Portal 2 poster as well.
31-07-2019T14:23:39,CrimsonQuill,I think she'd be friends with Chell personally...
31-07-2019T14:23:58,TeapotOfDoom,Who's raine not friends with
31-07-2019T14:24:11,TeapotOfDoom,She's to wholesome for this world
31-07-2019T14:24:20,CrimsonQuill,:)
31-07-2019T14:24:36,CrimsonQuill,I want to make her Halo reference sheet
31-07-2019T14:24:45,CrimsonQuill,"Air assault armour, or at least helmet."
31-07-2019T14:24:49,TeapotOfDoom,The store i bought the opm manga had pictures of glados as a warning for the cctv
31-07-2019T14:24:55,CrimsonQuill,Niiice
31-07-2019T14:25:07,CrimsonQuill,I have paperback OPM Vols 1-3.
31-07-2019T14:25:15,CrimsonQuill,But I need more...
31-07-2019T14:25:36,TeapotOfDoom,Got 10 and 11 today but i might some more before we leave tomorrow
31-07-2019T14:25:59,TeapotOfDoom,Everything else i already knew from the anime
31-07-2019T14:26:51,TeapotOfDoom,Have you been able to draw something in the meantime?
31-07-2019T14:27:30,TeapotOfDoom,Also there's a monster called cenisenpai wtf lol
31-07-2019T14:27:38,TeapotOfDoom,Centisenpai
31-07-2019T14:32:05,CrimsonQuill,Not really
31-07-2019T14:32:14,CrimsonQuill,I have drafts for Bailey's reference sheet
31-07-2019T14:32:29,CrimsonQuill,And an idea as to how he became a Spartan
31-07-2019T14:32:34,CrimsonQuill,But it's very sketchy.
31-07-2019T14:35:02,SniperJackal,You can always pull a spartan II and make them be kidnapped children
31-07-2019T14:35:14,SniperJackal,but thats a bit dark
31-07-2019T14:35:58,TeapotOfDoom,I guess spartan in a halo sence? As you know i really don't know much about halo
31-07-2019T14:48:33,CrimsonQuill,"No, they're definitely Spartan IVs. And it's ok, Teapot, confusion is understandable."
31-07-2019T14:49:27,CrimsonQuill,"Spartan Bailey (OC) is ex-Marine Lieutenant, Spartan Adams (OC) is ex-Marine Private first class and Spartan Raine would be ex ODST."
31-07-2019T14:49:44,CrimsonQuill,AI Red would be a combat AI to help her in sniping and the like.
31-07-2019T14:50:03,CrimsonQuill,As well as the team's electronic assistance.
31-07-2019T14:58:04,SniperJackal,oh you actually used the idea on tom s sketch
31-07-2019T14:58:07,SniperJackal,nice
31-07-2019T14:59:01,TeapotOfDoom,I already burned through the first manga
31-07-2019T14:59:11,TeapotOfDoom,Looks like i have to get moar
31-07-2019T14:59:11,SniperJackal,"oh sorry, I just realised you requested it"
31-07-2019T14:59:19,CrimsonQuill,@SniperJackal it's ok
31-07-2019T14:59:22,TeapotOfDoom,M O A R
31-07-2019T15:00:25,SniperJackal,thinking of playing some more spv3
31-07-2019T15:00:32,CrimsonQuill,"I just wanted to create a backstory and then thought, 'She needs a fireteam to be a part of',"
31-07-2019T15:00:39,TeapotOfDoom,Quite some time sice we've seen some Raine hasn't it...
31-07-2019T15:00:45,CrimsonQuill,Yep
31-07-2019T15:01:02,TeapotOfDoom,Cat nora took over
31-07-2019T15:01:06,CrimsonQuill,"Well, my suggestion (as usual) is Raine and Red having a heartwarming kiss under a waterfall."
31-07-2019T15:01:10,SniperJackal,yeah thats one thing I hate
31-07-2019T15:01:15,CrimsonQuill,Emphasis on the heartwarming part.
31-07-2019T15:01:29,SniperJackal,the absolute spam with cat nore or similar
31-07-2019T15:01:33,SniperJackal,nora*
31-07-2019T15:01:43,TeapotOfDoom,Ah so that one's yours. I should have figured that out...
31-07-2019T15:01:45,CrimsonQuill,I'd like it to be an 'awwwww' sketch.
31-07-2019T15:01:54,SniperJackal,I would like to se that quill
31-07-2019T15:02:02,SniperJackal,big fan of red x raine relationship

31-07-2019T15:02:24,CrimsonQuill,@TeapotOfDoom @SniperJackal What can I say? If she were a real life person I'd want to be her friend.

31-07-2019T15:03:24,SniperJackal,too many flood on one screen
31-07-2019T15:03:39,CrimsonQuill,"It might have 12gb ram but it has a 'piss poor' graphics card, to quote Kelly from TFoR."
31-07-2019T15:03:51,SniperJackal,yeah thats why its a cute and interesting relationship
31-07-2019T15:03:58,Sclimshady,:ptv-shipit:
31-07-2019T15:04:03,CrimsonQuill,@TeapotOfDoom I prefer not to use the term 'dork'.
31-07-2019T15:04:07,TeapotOfDoom,Yay sclim
31-07-2019T15:04:20,CrimsonQuill,It just sounds....a bit unpleasent.

31-07-2019T15:05:14,TeapotOfDoom,Red intellectual?
31-07-2019T15:05:16,CrimsonQuill,"Yes, it might"
31-07-2019T15:05:22,TeapotOfDoom,Really?
31-07-2019T15:05:35,CrimsonQuill,"Hey, Red might be a bit of a numpty, but he worked in theater."
31-07-2019T15:05:39,SniperJackal,Raine s more of an intellectual
31-07-2019T15:05:50,CrimsonQuill,Raine is the smarter one knowledge wise though.
31-07-2019T15:05:50,TeapotOfDoom,Right i forgot that
31-07-2019T15:05:59,SniperJackal,red is just well

31-07-2019T15:06:09,Sclimshady,Raine is the big nerd :ctwokinds-rainehappy:
31-07-2019T15:06:12,TeapotOfDoom,That's so extremly off character for him
31-07-2019T15:06:21,SniperJackal,a few months ago I reread a chapter idk which one
31-07-2019T15:06:36,TeapotOfDoom,:ctwokinds-rainehappy: *[I'm the one who nerds]
31-07-2019T15:06:41,CrimsonQuill,"I think as far as Red is concerned, it's in character."
31-07-2019T15:06:44,SniperJackal,and I found when red was talking about why he isnt into maren
31-07-2019T15:06:55,CrimsonQuill,@TeapotOfDoom How did you do that speech bubble thing?
31-07-2019T15:07:26,TeapotOfDoom,You have to do * /[ around your text /]
31-07-2019T15:07:27,SniperJackal,actually im just gonna try to find the page
31-07-2019T15:07:30,Sclimshady,*[this thing?]
31-07-2019T15:07:34,CrimsonQuill,@SniperJackal is that the one where Raine says she considered Maren kind of cute (and inadvertadely began the MarenXRaine shipping?
31-07-2019T15:07:36,TeapotOfDoom,Without the salshes
31-07-2019T15:07:47,CrimsonQuill,"@TeapotOfDoom Oh, thanks."
31-07-2019T15:07:52,CrimsonQuill,I'll paste and save it.
31-07-2019T15:08:01,TeapotOfDoom,The star is where the bubble is pointing
31-07-2019T15:08:03,TerraTheWizard,putting the asterisk on the other side changes where the bubble point is
31-07-2019T15:08:17,TeapotOfDoom,Works both directions. No spaces
31-07-2019T15:08:24,CrimsonQuill,Thanks for the tip Terraa

31-07-2019T15:15:53,SniperJackal,wait isnt twokinds sor of a manga
31-07-2019T15:16:36,Sclimshady,"Manga influenced, but it's still read from left to right"
31-07-2019T15:16:44,SniperJackal,yeah
31-07-2019T15:16:48,SniperJackal,that
31-07-2019T15:17:22,Sclimshady,I'm ashamed of how often I read comics from right to left
31-07-2019T15:17:48,TeapotOfDoom,Lol
31-07-2019T15:18:18,TeapotOfDoom,Two observations:
31-07-2019T15:19:18,TeapotOfDoom,I don't see Raine being into Maren at all. This was just a plain opinion. (Still i think the shipping is funny but mostly because of Raine being flustered)
31-07-2019T15:19:54,TeapotOfDoom,Second Red says it WAS a small village. That sounds kinda suspicious to me
31-07-2019T15:21:46,Sclimshady,"It could be because they left, or it was completely obliterated"
31-07-2019T15:24:45,SniperJackal,the village was destroyed
31-07-2019T15:24:47,SniperJackal,but
31-07-2019T15:24:55,SniperJackal,im more interested into the since Tan-er...
31-07-2019T15:25:15,SniperJackal,maybe she had a bad relationship with another guy
31-07-2019T15:25:34,SniperJackal,I never said about raine being in to maren
31-07-2019T15:25:39,SniperJackal,lol
31-07-2019T15:28:32,SniperJackal,since the first letter is a capital
31-07-2019T15:28:34,SniperJackal,probably a name
31-07-2019T15:36:49,TeapotOfDoom,I also wanted to know if the shipping had any real foundation in canon
31-07-2019T15:37:03,TeapotOfDoom,Name of someone or something
31-07-2019T16:58:46,SpazztasticKiwi,ahhhhhh

31-07-2019T17:05:35,SpazztasticKiwi,"just if you have kids, don’t smother them"
31-07-2019T17:06:04,SpazztasticKiwi,they will grow to rather despise being around you
31-07-2019T17:08:58,TeapotOfDoom,there's a rather fitting word in german for that
31-07-2019T17:09:07,TeapotOfDoom,translates to helicopter parents

31-07-2019T17:39:42,SpazztasticKiwi,that’s progress right
31-07-2019T17:40:31,SpazztasticKiwi,for a second though I’ll admit I thought I was gonna need a hospital cause the spicy in it did a funny thing to my throat till I got used to it
31-07-2019T17:40:42,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t normally eat peppery stuff
31-07-2019T17:42:26,SpazztasticKiwi,oh hai Tom

31-07-2019T17:46:36,TeapotOfDoom,we've got a thai street food thing in front of my workplace and i love it to bits. still if they say it's hot don't even try touching it. it will desintegrate your mouth
31-07-2019T17:47:45,TeapotOfDoom,anyway i should head to bed. night y'all!

31-07-2019T17:52:57,SpazztasticKiwi,I put in a new one - probably won’t get too much attention but it’s cute
31-07-2019T17:53:05,SpazztasticKiwi,cute get votes
31-07-2019T17:54:39,Sclimshady,The only one I've got picked was a random idea that isn't on my suggestions list
31-07-2019T17:57:21,SpazztasticKiwi,mine had Flora in em
31-07-2019T17:57:51,SpazztasticKiwi,maybe I should try another Flora
31-07-2019T17:59:20,SpazztasticKiwi,I wonder if Trace and Flora have a anniversary date or if it’s just “well it feels like it’s been a year”

31-07-2019T18:51:14,AspiringNoodle,So much so that I can't spend that money when it's meant to purchase something specific ._.
31-07-2019T18:51:30,AspiringNoodle,Lots of nature this week!
31-07-2019T18:51:32,AspiringNoodle,And a birb :D
31-07-2019T18:52:15,AspiringNoodle,"...Do you think 20 years from now the word ""bird"" will be replaced with ""birb""?  And we'll all be like, ""It was a JOKE. It was meant to be cute ;_;"""
31-07-2019T18:52:54,Orthonox,Maybe as slang but not a replacement. Memes come and go.
31-07-2019T19:01:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom went by by
