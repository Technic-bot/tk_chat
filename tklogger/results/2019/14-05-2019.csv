14-05-2019T12:55:39,CrimsonQuill,It's bound to succeed soon enough.
14-05-2019T12:56:24,Twokinds,It takes me literally all day to fill out these ref sheets. Two in a row is too much.

14-05-2019T14:05:32,FloofyCat,Or is Nibbly gunna be just one story of many magical mishaps?
14-05-2019T14:06:33,Twokinds,There's 3 pages left

14-05-2019T14:32:37,CrimsonQuill,Sythe's expression in the last panel just says it all.
14-05-2019T14:33:02,CrimsonQuill,"And the ""excited Raine talking about magic sounds"" really clinches it!"
14-05-2019T14:33:37,TerraTheWizard,raine is a cute dork when she gets to nerd out
14-05-2019T14:33:50,FloofyCat,I'm loving Raine's dorkiness though
14-05-2019T14:34:05,FloofyCat,She's giving us all that sweet sweet juicy lore for free.
14-05-2019T14:34:09,CrimsonQuill,"It's not ""Dorkiness"", it's Bookishness!"

14-05-2019T14:38:02,CrimsonQuill,All of our candles are in deep jars
14-05-2019T14:38:08,CrimsonQuill,And we only use them in Winter.
14-05-2019T14:38:15,CrimsonQuill,Or if my mum wants to.
14-05-2019T14:38:30,FloofyCat,She'll rotate something flammable 5 degrees so it falls off something.
14-05-2019T14:38:56,CrimsonQuill,She'll have a job finding it.
14-05-2019T14:39:07,CrimsonQuill,:ptv-victory:
14-05-2019T14:41:18,iliar,"Yes, I thought about it. If it's hard just translate, then how difficult is it to create it all.  Although you should not forget that I have a regular job."
14-05-2019T14:52:48,Twokinds,Yeah true
14-05-2019T14:53:06,CrimsonQuill,Do you translate it into a lot of languages Iliar?
14-05-2019T14:53:09,CrimsonQuill,Or just one?
14-05-2019T14:53:15,CrimsonQuill,I'm a bit confused
14-05-2019T14:53:25,iliar,Russian
14-05-2019T14:54:28,CrimsonQuill,I see.
14-05-2019T14:57:29,iliar,"Funny fact. When you translate the most problems with ""how to say it in Russian."""
14-05-2019T14:57:52,CrimsonQuill,Oooof
14-05-2019T14:58:56,Twokinds,Heheh
14-05-2019T14:59:11,Twokinds,"Half the time when I try to write dialogue, I think to myself ""how do I say my ideas in English"""
14-05-2019T14:59:50,Twokinds,It's sometimes tricky to translate a concept that seems simple into a story with words that flow well.
14-05-2019T15:00:09,CrimsonQuill,At least you have a story and characters.
14-05-2019T15:00:21,iliar,"For example on last page ""I'm changing"". In English it's mean ""I'm change clothes"" and ""I'm change form"". But in Russian it is different words."
14-05-2019T15:00:30,CrimsonQuill,"Every time I try to make a story, setting, or characters, they're a bit too flat..."
14-05-2019T15:00:38,Twokinds,"Yeah, double meanings must be hard."
14-05-2019T15:00:38,CrimsonQuill,Interesting iliar
14-05-2019T15:00:59,CrimsonQuill,I read that many people struggle to learn English because of all the double meanings.
14-05-2019T15:01:43,iliar,"In Russian, too many words with double meaning"
14-05-2019T15:03:58,tehbear,"unlike a book, a comic translation can rely more on the art perhaps?"
14-05-2019T15:04:40,tehbear,"a lot can be said with few words, when given context"
14-05-2019T15:05:23,CrimsonQuill,Be back in a bit
14-05-2019T15:05:45,tehbear,otoh. the characters need to say things that make sense from their perspective...
14-05-2019T15:06:00,iliar,"It really gets in the way when you want to say something in English.  For example, you want to say ""I forgot my keys at home.""  You do not know how to translate the word key.  Open the dictionary and see"
14-05-2019T15:06:01,tehbear,writing is hard
14-05-2019T15:06:43,tehbear,i forgot my lock unlockers at home :P
14-05-2019T15:07:30,iliar,"feeder, key, id, legend, passport"
14-05-2019T15:08:20,tehbear,aha. i see. the ambiguity of looking up words
14-05-2019T15:12:52,iliar,You write: I forgot my spring at house. And other people can't understand you.
14-05-2019T15:13:27,tehbear,house - home
14-05-2019T15:13:31,tehbear,but spring?
14-05-2019T15:15:06,iliar,"The word ""ключ"" can be translated as a key and as spring."
14-05-2019T15:16:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Keys only exist because people can’t keep their hands to themselves
14-05-2019T15:16:52,SpazztasticKiwi,🥁
14-05-2019T15:18:49,tehbear,"i did some translation my self for wikipedia, and often entirely different phrases / sentences must be used, since its unnatural or incomprehensible to use a direct translation"
14-05-2019T15:19:05,tehbear,depending on the language & culture ofc
14-05-2019T15:20:59,tehbear,i suppose getting it to fit with speach bubbles is a puzzle
14-05-2019T15:21:06,tehbear,*speech

14-05-2019T15:48:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I knew the undead were proud of their numbers but damn. Rub it in everyone’s faces
14-05-2019T15:56:39,Twokinds,?
14-05-2019T15:56:56,Twokinds,XD It's just nice to make progress.
14-05-2019T15:57:04,Twokinds,Or at least see it.
14-05-2019T15:57:24,iliar,179???
14-05-2019T15:58:04,iliar,Are you talking about weight?
14-05-2019T15:58:07,Twokinds,81.2kg
14-05-2019T15:59:13,iliar,I need to buy a scale. It is very stupid to try to lose weight without seeing progress.
14-05-2019T16:05:43,Twokinds,Having a scale certainly helps.
14-05-2019T16:05:53,Twokinds,I also have a body fat monitor.
14-05-2019T16:06:25,iliar,Do you believe this device?
14-05-2019T16:07:00,Twokinds,"Eh, it's not very accurate. But it gives at least an impression."
14-05-2019T16:09:34,Xexanoth,"i measured progress in ""fit properly in my pants again"""
14-05-2019T16:09:47,Xexanoth,also: stomach doesn't look like ball anymore XD
14-05-2019T16:11:53,Twokinds,Haha yeah
14-05-2019T16:12:00,iliar,"After the collapse of the USSR, many strange devices began to appear in Russia. Such as aura meters, water structuring devices etc. The body fat monitor came along with these devices."
14-05-2019T16:12:05,iliar,"Perhaps this is not correct, but I can not take it seriously. I think this is the same fake device."
14-05-2019T16:12:43,Twokinds,"Yeah, I can see that. It's hard to tell if such devices actually do what they claim."
14-05-2019T16:13:28,Twokinds,Probably the best way to test body fat is the pinch test. But I don't know how to do it. Nor do I have the calipers.
14-05-2019T16:13:47,Twokinds,"I'm just happy I can wear my belt without it being uncomfortable now, once again."
14-05-2019T16:14:37,SpazztasticKiwi,It was a poke at age  that’s all
14-05-2019T16:14:52,SpazztasticKiwi,But it’s good you’re still seeing progress
14-05-2019T16:15:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Ever hear about the bellybutton challenge that went around for awhile. More women tried it than men but you know
14-05-2019T16:22:57,Twokinds,No
14-05-2019T16:23:09,CrimsonQuill,Back
14-05-2019T16:23:19,CrimsonQuill,Talking about languages and scales?
14-05-2019T16:25:26,SpazztasticKiwi,"It (a ridiculous trend) where you’d take your index finger from one arm, say the right, and try to stretch your stomach from the bellybutton to the left with that finger with that arm behind your back"

14-05-2019T16:31:49,CrimsonQuill,No....
14-05-2019T16:32:43,iliar,About Nora Ref Sheet. After this sketch https://www.deviantart.com/twokinds/art/Nora-s-Fantasy-Sketch-109751040 I was thinking than Nora have submissive fetish.
14-05-2019T16:32:52,iliar,But today I looked at other art with it and did not find other evidence of this theory. It made me wonder if I was thinking about her correctly.
14-05-2019T16:54:16,Bgrmystr2,@SpazztasticKiwi you can probably do that if you're double-jointed.
14-05-2019T16:55:13,Bgrmystr2,"my dad could take his left arm, bend it behind his back, past his right shoulder, and tap my mom on HER right shoulder.. just to make her look the other way and think someone was there."
14-05-2019T16:56:16,Bgrmystr2,"my left arm can't bend as far, but it is also double jointed and can bend pretty nicely. I can reach both of my shoulder blades on my back with my left arm."
14-05-2019T16:56:18,CrimsonQuill,ooof
14-05-2019T16:57:07,Bgrmystr2,"It's not exactly useful for anything important, but I can at least scratch my back where most people couldn't cuz they can't reach."
14-05-2019T16:59:03,SpazztasticKiwi,I can do higher flexibility more than lower. I can’t do that mess but I’m also obviously not that small
14-05-2019T16:59:51,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s mainly about flexibility. Of course the cheerleaders and such could do it
14-05-2019T17:02:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"As for Nora, why not both? Plenty of women can be happy with being either or dependent on the mood or day"
14-05-2019T17:04:53,Xexanoth,not just woman...
14-05-2019T17:05:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Let’s just open all the worms then huh
14-05-2019T17:07:15,Bgrmystr2,"Nora's basically the most powerful being on Mekkan bar the masks, and even then she can do silly fun things and they won't like.. delete her or whatever"
14-05-2019T17:07:53,Bgrmystr2,"so it makes sense for her to have an inner passion for being dominated by someone more powerful, that's actually a super common thing for people in positions of power."
14-05-2019T17:08:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"“Should we get rid of her boss?” “Kinkyness is not a lethal offense, Paul”"
14-05-2019T17:08:58,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-laugh: right
14-05-2019T17:09:59,SpazztasticKiwi,This is not the weirdest conversation I’ve come across today believe it or not

14-05-2019T17:18:44,Bgrmystr2,Don't play it. Dunno :u
14-05-2019T17:20:16,SpazztasticKiwi,found it
14-05-2019T17:22:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve noticed something. This game called Monster Legends has a monster called Thindereagle. Looks an awful lot like Zapdos
14-05-2019T17:23:56,Bgrmystr2,yeah it's prettymuch a blatant copy
14-05-2019T17:24:08,Bgrmystr2,"it probably falls under ""Parody under japanese law though"
14-05-2019T17:24:31,Bgrmystr2,"which is fine I guess, but some of the comments on the wiki page say that monster legend is claiming they came before pokemon"
14-05-2019T17:24:39,Bgrmystr2,"which CAN be used against them, far as I know."
14-05-2019T17:27:17,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s a few “monsters” that are obviously pokemon inspired at the very least
14-05-2019T17:27:46,SpazztasticKiwi,I wonder if that’s why I think I have one when I don’t. I’ve just seen the design somewhere else
14-05-2019T17:28:34,Bgrmystr2,yeah
14-05-2019T17:28:50,Bgrmystr2,Japan has a huge market for parody
14-05-2019T17:28:59,Bgrmystr2,super massive
14-05-2019T17:29:22,Bgrmystr2,where most of it would be taken to court here in the US over being infringing.
14-05-2019T17:30:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Yet I’d love to go. Seán did a bit ago for the Detective Pikachu and Godzilla things
14-05-2019T17:30:27,Bgrmystr2,"We do have free speech, whatever that helps nowadays with every company and it's parent breaking the amendment to silence people making art and stuff."
14-05-2019T17:30:28,SpazztasticKiwi,so much shiny and colorful

14-05-2019T18:22:37,SpazztasticKiwi,I saw two baby squirrels
14-05-2019T18:24:42,SpazztasticKiwi,One was nothing but a handful of fuzz
14-05-2019T21:28:06,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-maddiessparkles:
14-05-2019T21:37:07,AspiringNoodle,I once saw two baby bunnies
14-05-2019T21:37:17,AspiringNoodle,My heart 'sploded from the cuteness.
14-05-2019T21:41:44,Mippy,Was just reminded of that horrible time when if you did not like a “pretentious bull shit” type of anime...it meant you “just did not get it” :ptv-grossedout:
14-05-2019T21:48:46,Bgrmystr2,":thinking: some are good, some are bad, some are meh. Not everyone will like the same thing."
14-05-2019T22:01:41,AspiringNoodle,I like SAO.  Helps that I turn my brain off xD
14-05-2019T22:02:11,AspiringNoodle,"But I think in general I'm more in love with the idea of full-dive, and how that's a technical possibility potentially decades from now."
14-05-2019T22:02:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Some should be downright illegal
14-05-2019T22:03:31,Mippy,Click here to confirm: YouTube recommending a video about Serial Experiments Lain brought back the memories
14-05-2019T22:05:44,SpazztasticKiwi,"Speaking of YT, Tyler Mark & Ethan tried blindfolded tie dye. You see?"
14-05-2019T22:06:23,Mippy,Yes! I...actually kind of liked Ethan’s shirt
14-05-2019T22:06:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Yes! It was like a watercolor
14-05-2019T22:06:53,SpazztasticKiwi,“Muted seafoam”
14-05-2019T22:08:16,SpazztasticKiwi,It was interesting to see Mark does some challenges better blindfolded. And I want to say Tyler’s would’ve come up better if the colors hadn’t blended so much
14-05-2019T22:11:14,Mippy,Tyler’s got rubbed too much. Mark’s was pretty decent. Gosh! I haven’t tie dyed since I was a kid.
14-05-2019T22:16:53,AspiringNoodle,^
14-05-2019T22:18:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Mark’s was pretty for blindfolded work. Last I the dyed was sometime early high school
14-05-2019T22:19:13,SpazztasticKiwi,I wonder how they’d do with archery. Good bet they haven’t tried that
14-05-2019T22:19:33,SpazztasticKiwi,But someone restrain them from doing it blindfolded
14-05-2019T22:43:07,Sclimshady,"I dont think doing blindfolded archery is a good idea, but it would make good entertainment"
14-05-2019T23:00:00,AspiringNoodle,Blindfolded archer is more or less one step below shooting a gun blindfolded.
14-05-2019T23:00:30,AspiringNoodle,"Not nearly as dangerous, but still potentially deadly, and just as likely to ruin someone's day should you screw up."
14-05-2019T23:00:59,AspiringNoodle,"Aka, don't do it unless you take every precaution.  And even then, please don't!"
14-05-2019T23:07:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Tried some goal clothes on. They fit better
