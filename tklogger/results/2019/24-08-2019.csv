24-08-2019T15:10:50,FloofyCat,Not mine but I was hoping that'd win or get... Tominated?
24-08-2019T15:10:54,CrimsonQuill,@CrimsonHelsing same  here...rather low

24-08-2019T15:13:29,CrimsonHelsing,@CrimsonQuill thanks
24-08-2019T15:13:38,PalmettoPathfinder1,"I like One Punch Man.  Awesome action scenes, but Goblin Slayer is a bit dark for my tastes, but it has an interesting story, which I like @Orthonox."
24-08-2019T15:13:39,HoverdudeXL,What he gonna draw today
24-08-2019T15:13:40,CrimsonQuill,@CrimsonHelsing No problem

24-08-2019T15:14:12,CrimsonQuill,I'm hoping my RaineXRed Waterfall'll be Tominated some time
24-08-2019T15:14:45,unsteddyphoenix,HELLO NERDS :ctwokinds-floAAA:
24-08-2019T15:14:46,Orthonox,I definitely liked both of them. I seen season 2 of OPM and Goblin Slayer recently so they are still fresh on my mind.
24-08-2019T15:14:50,AnuSekaniArt,Eyyy Teddy ^^
24-08-2019T15:14:52,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Teddy!

24-08-2019T15:14:54,Sclimshady,HI TEDDY O/
24-08-2019T15:14:57,CrimsonQuill,Hey there Unsteddy!
24-08-2019T15:15:04,PalmettoPathfinder1,"@Orthonox although I find it weird and funny that the gods of the Goblin Slayer universe treat the world like a tabletop RPG, but I find it interesting that Goblin Slayer doesn't let anyone roll the dice for him.  :D"
24-08-2019T15:15:05,Vatruvius,Hello unsteddy
24-08-2019T15:15:21,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Teddy, I got a new Chalie picture, you want?"
24-08-2019T15:15:30,FloofyCat,"Teddy, the top 4 are all Kat!"
24-08-2019T15:15:46,unsteddyphoenix,:OO !
24-08-2019T15:15:49,FloofyCat,... Kat dressing up as other characters with 100% realism!
24-08-2019T15:15:58,RansuDoragon,what's being drawn here?
24-08-2019T15:15:59,Almighty404,The opposite of a Kat-astrophe ?
24-08-2019T15:16:05,unsteddyphoenix,...waaait a minute...
24-08-2019T15:16:10,Sclimshady,How dare you play with his poor little heart like that Floofy
24-08-2019T15:16:16,AnuSekaniArt,Floofy XD
24-08-2019T15:16:28,Corinthian,Yo
24-08-2019T15:16:35,FloofyCat,Hi Corinthian
24-08-2019T15:16:37,Sclimshady,Hi Corinthian o/
24-08-2019T15:16:46,CrimsonQuill,Hullo Corinthian.
24-08-2019T15:16:51,FloofyCat,now playing in Teddy's heart: Gary Jules - Mad World
24-08-2019T15:16:54,Orthonox,@PalmettoPathfinder1 The funny thing about Goblin Slayer for me is that the main character is so compelling because everything else besides the goblins is generic and boring. I get the setting is suppose to be a standard fantasy but it still bored me.
24-08-2019T15:16:55,unsteddyphoenix,youve played me like a fiddle
24-08-2019T15:17:28,Nirnan,The question is
24-08-2019T15:17:33,unsteddyphoenix,this has been a katless month so far :ctwokinds-katwet:
24-08-2019T15:17:37,Nirnan,Why picarto an not ytb '^'
24-08-2019T15:17:51,FloofyCat,There's still a chance for Tom picks.
24-08-2019T15:18:40,Sclimshady,Nora is quite the fox
24-08-2019T15:18:50,CrimsonQuill,Sionnach Glic
24-08-2019T15:19:05,CrimsonQuill,(That's Gaeilge for 'Crafty Fox')
24-08-2019T15:19:07,Sclimshady,I can't speak Garlic
24-08-2019T15:19:07,Vatruvius,Picarto allows music to be played that Tom may not have the rights to play if I am correct.
24-08-2019T15:19:09,PalmettoPathfinder1,"@Orthonox, Actually I found Goblin Slayer to be interesting that it looks like a standard fantasy but when you see those greenhorns get brutally taken down by goblins you realized it's not your run of the mill fantasy world."
24-08-2019T15:19:17,Vatruvius,@Nirnan
24-08-2019T15:19:25,CrimsonQuill,Couldn't resist it Sclim
24-08-2019T15:19:28,Orthonox,"@unsteddyphoenix Yes, with only three Kat art pieces submitted this month."
24-08-2019T15:19:30,Sclimshady,All royalty free here
24-08-2019T15:20:09,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Not to mention I played D&D back in the day, so I knew right off the bat that if goblins are stealing crops, livestock, and kidnapping people, then they are both large and have powerful leaders and or guards!"
24-08-2019T15:20:30,Vatruvius,That sounds about right.
24-08-2019T15:20:58,unsteddyphoenix,thats BASICALLY  0

24-08-2019T15:22:03,Orthonox,"@PalmettoPathfinder1, That is what I mean. The Goblins and Goblin Slayers keeps the show interesting. I like the lore behind the Goblins and the character motivations behind Goblin Slayer. It is just that I can find a reason to care about anything else."
24-08-2019T15:22:09,Sclimshady,Hi Teapot o/

24-08-2019T15:22:37,WereKeidran,"okay, anyone know of an artist i could commission to do  a color sketch of me as an anthro-fox dude? I'd save money for that!"

24-08-2019T15:23:02,Orthonox,@unsteddyphoenix I love me some Kat but I can take a break for other less represented characters to shine.
24-08-2019T15:23:04,PalmettoPathfinder1,@Orthonox Goblin Slayer does remind me of Doomguy.
24-08-2019T15:23:07,Almighty404,@TeapotOfDoom Fluff. You're looking at lovely fluff.
24-08-2019T15:23:10,MatyMaty,"ooh, she looks fluffy"
24-08-2019T15:23:12,Zakuru,@werekeidran
24-08-2019T15:23:22,TeapotOfDoom,Lovely fluff indeed lol
24-08-2019T15:23:32,TeapotOfDoom,so we went through the feline phase
24-08-2019T15:23:40,TeapotOfDoom,Now we're in the canine phase?
24-08-2019T15:23:50,AnuSekaniArt,Heeey Teapot :)
24-08-2019T15:23:51,Vatruvius,I have to say Flora has be rather absent in sketches. I thought Tom's work on the latest page was amazing and would mind seeing more.
24-08-2019T15:23:52,TeapotOfDoom,Also I have to pull up ma bingo sheet
24-08-2019T15:23:55,Almighty404,Let's hope we skip the surrealist phase.
24-08-2019T15:23:55,MatyMaty,"Depends a lot on your budget and what kind of style you like, werekeidran :O"

24-08-2019T15:24:51,CrimsonQuill,I've been playing Minecraft for years

24-08-2019T15:25:51,WereKeidran,"my budget could be flexible if i go without video games. As for style, i like Tom's, Desert Fox's and Master Godai's styles particularly but can be flexible a bit there too"
24-08-2019T15:26:03,Tharkis,oh man
24-08-2019T15:26:14,Tharkis,i totally thought of a sketch idea
24-08-2019T15:26:28,Tharkis,"that if i manage to see Tom at a convention next year, i gotta see if he'd doodle"
24-08-2019T15:26:33,Tharkis,>_<
24-08-2019T15:26:38,iliar,I think people have found a legal way to create new characters. Tom don't allow OC? Okay. It's not OC. It's cat/dog/fox/bird Nora.
24-08-2019T15:26:50,CrRAR,lol
24-08-2019T15:26:50,unsteddyphoenix,lmao
24-08-2019T15:26:53,AnuSekaniArt,I've gotta save up and go to a convention one day XD
24-08-2019T15:26:57,unsteddyphoenix,but wheres the lie though
24-08-2019T15:27:07,Tharkis,"you gotta admit, cat-nora is @%@# awesome, and 4 legged catnora is even canon =D"
24-08-2019T15:27:40,unsteddyphoenix,catnora is pretty great...
24-08-2019T15:27:44,CrRAR,yis
24-08-2019T15:27:47,TeapotOfDoom,Brb had to use my second monitor to fix ma server gotta get it from the basement
24-08-2019T15:27:47,AnuSekaniArt,Catnora is fun ^^
24-08-2019T15:28:30,Almighty404,"Can she turn her wings into arms or legs ? 'Cause Tharkis' mention of ""4-legged cat Nora"" made me consider ""6-legged cat Nora"""
24-08-2019T15:28:48,Sclimshady,Thas a lot of legs
24-08-2019T15:28:51,Vatruvius,Oh boy...
24-08-2019T15:29:06,CrRAR,Wasn't there a Flora as a tigertaur or something with an extra pair of arms?
24-08-2019T15:29:10,RazorToshiba,3 many legs 5 me
24-08-2019T15:29:19,CrRAR,She also had a horse body once
24-08-2019T15:29:26,Almighty404,"Maybe for one of her first attempt at shapeshifting, and she shapeshifted more than she should."
24-08-2019T15:29:29,swack24,does anybody have the link to the polls yet?
24-08-2019T15:29:30,BadFoMo,Back. What was this one again?
24-08-2019T15:29:31,Vatruvius,"2 legged, 4 armed cat nora trying to undress and not amused Trace"
24-08-2019T15:29:34,CrimsonQuill,Be right back
24-08-2019T15:29:35,Vatruvius,Saving that idea.
24-08-2019T15:29:36,Orthonox,"@PalmettoPathfinder1 I have not played DOOM 2016 outside of a demo but I always got the impression that despite being silent, Doomguy is able to convey a lot of character. Goblin Slayer would have the makeup of a boring character but he is not one."
24-08-2019T15:29:39,CrRAR,Flora got some creative additions over the years. xD
24-08-2019T15:29:43,WereKeidran,"you know, i have an idea for a suggestion but i have to wait for my current to be done first"
24-08-2019T15:30:05,ShamusTheFox,Cute!
24-08-2019T15:30:16,FloofyCat,I played Doom on an old PC ages ago and all the Doom reboot stuff looked kinda meh to me.

24-08-2019T15:35:10,ShamusTheFox,I have a feeling Nora would try every variety until she finds one that works for Trace.
24-08-2019T15:35:25,CrRAR,lol

24-08-2019T15:36:02,TeapotOfDoom,Aw that just sounds quite desperate
24-08-2019T15:36:04,FloofyCat,"@BadFoMo Yeah, that way Tom can draw Nora's 1248851th form, a completely blank shadowless white screen on top of everything else :p"

24-08-2019T15:36:15,Sclimshady,She just needs to change into Flora and dispose of the original
24-08-2019T15:36:19,Vatruvius,I would answer yes but I am not Trace so...I don't know what is wrong with his head. Oh wait...
24-08-2019T15:36:24,Sclimshady,Hi Moon o/

24-08-2019T15:38:02,TeapotOfDoom,Maybe the horns gave it away
24-08-2019T15:38:04,CrimsonQuill,I have trouble understanding what the trend is with vixens here.

24-08-2019T16:29:28,IronHorseComics,I am so glad it's most likely I'll never have to do all that again

24-08-2019T16:46:23,AnuSekaniArt,It does Nezumi xD
24-08-2019T16:46:51,ShamusTheFox,"Speaking of Reni, I wonder what form she will take for the pool. I'm guessing keidran wolf or small dog."
24-08-2019T16:47:39,MatyMaty,oh this is so cute
24-08-2019T16:47:41,ShamusTheFox,Oh...maybe not wolf. I forgot about the war.
24-08-2019T16:47:46,Sclimshady,I am the real one
24-08-2019T16:47:48,WereKeidran,checks in
24-08-2019T16:47:48,FenceEqualizer,"If it's Kei, just accept the petting, Reni."
24-08-2019T16:47:56,NezumiYuki,If Reni becomes smol doggo.... The heck with you guys... I'm pushin ya out of the way to git me some cute doggo dragon to hug!  xDD

24-08-2019T16:48:02,CrimsonQuill,Ok
24-08-2019T16:48:18,CrimsonQuill,To quote Every Robot in 'Freefall'....
24-08-2019T16:48:22,ThingsAreMoving,"I am hoping for humanized Reni, since we know that's spoiler central and at some point we can hope to see ie"
24-08-2019T16:48:23,CrimsonQuill,'DOGGY!'
24-08-2019T16:48:25,ThingsAreMoving,it*
24-08-2019T16:48:27,TeapotOfDoom,the hell happened here
24-08-2019T16:48:33,CrimsonQuill,throws their hands up into the air
24-08-2019T16:48:41,kts,that face... it's absolutely adorable XD
24-08-2019T16:48:55,ShamusTheFox,"Hee, Freefall is fun."
24-08-2019T16:49:12,NezumiYuki,Pupper needs sum belly rubs  Pronto! <3
24-08-2019T16:51:12,CrimsonQuill,I remember the archive Panic I had seeing how many strips there were to read.
24-08-2019T16:51:35,CrimsonQuill,And the chuckles whenever someone is traumatized by Sam outside of his environment suit.
24-08-2019T16:51:56,ShamusTheFox,I am fully up to date on Freefall. But I don't think i could read the whole thing again.
24-08-2019T16:52:24,CrimsonQuill,The 'DOGGY'! Running gag is so fun...
24-08-2019T16:52:42,CrimsonQuill,It even got a reference in Twokinds itself...I have Tom's word of it.
24-08-2019T16:53:30,ShamusTheFox,I believe it!
24-08-2019T16:54:32,CrimsonQuill,It's the strip just after Raine's woken Maren and Karen up from Zen's poison...and gets Glomped.
24-08-2019T16:55:01,ShamusTheFox,Blarg!
24-08-2019T16:55:49,ShamusTheFox,"By the way, I love the recurring use of the word Blarg in Twokinds. It is one of my favorite nonsensical words."
24-08-2019T16:55:55,CrimsonQuill,Karen can never resist a floofy tail....
24-08-2019T16:56:01,CrimsonQuill,@ShamusTheFox True that.
24-08-2019T16:56:14,Sclimshady,My internet died...in the middle of a timed test FML
24-08-2019T16:56:23,CrimsonQuill,Oh dear...
24-08-2019T16:56:31,CrimsonQuill,You ok Sclim?
24-08-2019T16:56:42,ShamusTheFox,Three-legged doggo!
24-08-2019T16:57:04,Sclimshady,"Yee, it saved my progress thankfully"
24-08-2019T16:57:07,IronHorseComics,I had that happen to me
24-08-2019T16:57:08,TeapotOfDoom,That doggo looks kinda uneasy
24-08-2019T16:57:09,CrimsonQuill,:)
24-08-2019T16:57:13,ShamusTheFox,"Oh, there it is! ;)"
24-08-2019T16:57:14,IronHorseComics,well it IS Reni
24-08-2019T16:57:22,Sclimshady,The doggo is dergo
24-08-2019T16:57:29,TeapotOfDoom,Ah k that explains it
24-08-2019T16:57:30,CrimsonQuill,I've started my second Halo Fanon Reference sheet
24-08-2019T16:57:30,IronHorseComics,and she's getting pet by Captain Whatshisname
24-08-2019T16:57:51,TeapotOfDoom,I was kinda in an out working on an animation just because but got bored
24-08-2019T16:57:52,CrimsonQuill,I'm almost out of sketchpad paper
24-08-2019T16:58:10,ShamusTheFox,Reni fails at cool and composed.
24-08-2019T16:58:14,Almighty404,"So I guess dragons also can be cat persons or dog persons, but in a different way than others."
24-08-2019T16:58:25,TeapotOfDoom,Gets belly rubs instead
24-08-2019T16:58:31,Sclimshady,Kei :ctwokinds-keifacepalm:
24-08-2019T16:58:33,Xexanoth,more literall instead
24-08-2019T16:58:35,ShamusTheFox,Muffet!

24-08-2019T16:59:57,CrimsonQuill,Love this song so much
24-08-2019T16:59:57,Dominik1999,moin
24-08-2019T17:00:20,ShamusTheFox,Just had an image of the captain as Moffet and I laughed my ass off. No wonder Reni is alarmed!
24-08-2019T17:00:22,CrimsonQuill,I stopped squashing spiders because it upsets Muffet....
24-08-2019T17:00:43,CrimsonQuill,Now I just catch them in tins and toss 'em outside
24-08-2019T17:00:49,CrimsonQuill,Still terrified of them though
24-08-2019T17:01:01,ShamusTheFox,And buy their baked goods.
24-08-2019T17:01:03,TeapotOfDoom,Servus
24-08-2019T17:01:33,TeapotOfDoom,Mmmm i just had baked good
24-08-2019T17:01:34,TeapotOfDoom,s
24-08-2019T17:01:44,TeapotOfDoom,but now I'm out
24-08-2019T17:02:27,NezumiYuki,Teapot... Shhhh pls?   Let us not speak of baked goods because I want some scout cookies...  pffffffff
24-08-2019T17:02:34,FenceEqualizer,Kei: Who's a cute doggo? :ptv-laugh: You're a cute Do....wait a minute. :ptv-confused:
24-08-2019T17:02:42,CrimsonQuill,Hold on
24-08-2019T17:02:50,TeapotOfDoom,Wait a hot second
24-08-2019T17:02:53,CrimsonQuill,Imagine if it were Connor from Detroit petting her
24-08-2019T17:03:01,CrimsonQuill,Thinking she were a new Dog for Hank
24-08-2019T17:03:03,TeapotOfDoom,I'm Connor
24-08-2019T17:03:12,CrimsonQuill,The android sent by Cyberlife
24-08-2019T17:03:15,TeapotOfDoom,Nice
24-08-2019T17:03:17,CrimsonQuill,Seriously though
24-08-2019T17:03:18,AnuSekaniArt,"My name is Connor, I'm the andr-dammit beat me to it XD"
24-08-2019T17:03:42,CrimsonQuill,"Any time Connor and Sumo come up, myself and my sister are all... 'D'awwwww!;"
24-08-2019T17:03:49,CrimsonQuill,It's just so sweet.
24-08-2019T17:03:56,AnuSekaniArt,It is ^^
24-08-2019T17:05:38,CrimsonQuill,Keiren...you might want to check the collar of this doggy.
24-08-2019T17:06:29,CrimsonQuill,I like this one.
24-08-2019T17:06:55,HoverdudeXL,So cute
24-08-2019T17:07:07,AnuSekaniArt,"Indeed, this is extra cute :D"
24-08-2019T17:08:52,FloofyCat,Detroit Become Human was a giant derp
24-08-2019T17:09:05,FloofyCat,One guy is poor because he spent a ton of money on an android
24-08-2019T17:09:25,CrimsonQuill,I think the Hank-Connor part of the game is the best part.
24-08-2019T17:09:25,FloofyCat,But there's a fucking huge sea of deactivated androids just sat in a landfill.
24-08-2019T17:09:34,FloofyCat,There's thousands if not hundreds of thousands
24-08-2019T17:09:54,AcePilotIX,ooof
24-08-2019T17:10:02,FloofyCat,"If they're so cheap it's not even worth recycling them (somehow), then how could you become poor from buying one?"
24-08-2019T17:10:13,FloofyCat,There's literally thousands of free androids in a landfill
24-08-2019T17:10:17,FenceEqualizer,He was poor to begin with and made bad money choices?
24-08-2019T17:10:19,TeapotOfDoom,Stonks
24-08-2019T17:10:36,FloofyCat,Yeah but it was specifically saying how he spent all his money on an android
24-08-2019T17:10:47,AcePilotIX,i drink gravy
24-08-2019T17:10:52,TeapotOfDoom,Maybe they're like iPhones
24-08-2019T17:10:54,AnuSekaniArt,It's probably a future where androids are cheaper to make than a lot of over stuff?
24-08-2019T17:10:56,falangie123,dab
24-08-2019T17:11:03,AcePilotIX,no
24-08-2019T17:11:13,AcePilotIX,never
24-08-2019T17:11:31,FloofyCat,"Well you have some sort of pseudo-consciousness, but it's so cheap to make that people don't recycle perfectly functional parts."
24-08-2019T17:11:32,Sclimshady,Only ember dabs allowed in this chat tyvm
24-08-2019T17:11:39,TeapotOfDoom,People think they need to spend more money on them then they actually have and it's more a kind of status symbol then an actual tool
24-08-2019T17:11:48,FloofyCat,I mean judging by that one landfill alone how the f*ck do people have jobs
24-08-2019T17:12:23,TeapotOfDoom,They prolly just don't
24-08-2019T17:12:23,FenceEqualizer,I'm sure that was part of the reason for others hating the androids.
24-08-2019T17:12:35,FloofyCat,Yeah but how does anyone have a job
24-08-2019T17:12:44,SpazztasticKiwi,I went to the park to just sit today since it’s rainy. got in the pavilion with my salad with cookies and tea
24-08-2019T17:12:50,SpazztasticKiwi,downpour
24-08-2019T17:12:58,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m stuck now
24-08-2019T17:13:01,TeapotOfDoom,Sounds quite poetic
24-08-2019T17:13:01,AnuSekaniArt,Awwwww sorry to hear Kiwi
24-08-2019T17:13:02,FloofyCat,"It's either welfare, get equivalent to a postgraduate today, or just die."
24-08-2019T17:13:09,TeapotOfDoom,also Spazz o/
24-08-2019T17:13:26,Sclimshady,"Hi Kiwi, sorry you are stuck"
24-08-2019T17:13:28,Almighty404,"Post-scarcity doesn't work well in cyberpunk setting, especially if it's only work post-scarcity"
24-08-2019T17:13:42,FloofyCat,Because why pay humans if you can just pull an android out of the garbage and now you have free slave labour.
24-08-2019T17:13:44,falangie123,wow how did he colour that so quickly?
24-08-2019T17:13:55,TeapotOfDoom,selection
24-08-2019T17:13:58,InTheLionsDen,Magic
24-08-2019T17:14:02,ShamusTheFox,"""What kind of breed are you, I wonder?"" ""..."""
24-08-2019T17:14:13,FenceEqualizer,You're making it seem like they're in working order from the landfill.

24-08-2019T17:14:17,FloofyCat,Nah tbh the creator of Detroit:BH didn't think of this because the guy is actually a giant creep.
24-08-2019T17:14:18,TeapotOfDoom,selected reni and just went to town with the brush
24-08-2019T17:14:27,ShamusTheFox,"Ah, I love this song!"
24-08-2019T17:14:27,FenceEqualizer,Markus was literally ripping out parts to get himself working again at one point
24-08-2019T17:15:02,FloofyCat,"@FenceEqualizer, most of them had functioning parts. It's like throwing away a PC when one capacitor on the motherboard is bent, but you throw away two RTX 2080s with it."
24-08-2019T17:15:08,CrimsonQuill,Toby Fox music is always good.
24-08-2019T17:15:13,SpazztasticKiwi,ah the little spinny wheel of loading
24-08-2019T17:15:16,ShamusTheFox,"Snowden is a cold place, but it's cozy."
24-08-2019T17:15:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I didn’t miss you

24-08-2019T17:16:17,NezumiYuki,Oh go on and give the pupper some belly rubs already... Kei....
24-08-2019T17:16:19,FenceEqualizer,"They have functioning parts from different robots. Before the massive layoffs on them the androids in the landfills couldn't even really move. They only had enough function to say ""Don't rip my core I want to live"" Others where twitching broken messes"
24-08-2019T17:16:49,TeapotOfDoom,Terra o/
24-08-2019T17:16:51,FenceEqualizer,No way an adverage person is going to a landfill and making them work again unless they had knowledge in whatever robot building profession they had at the time.
24-08-2019T17:16:53,ShamusTheFox,"Well, I'm a twitching broken mess...metaphorically."
24-08-2019T17:16:56,ProsePro7,"All I can think of when I see this is the meme of ""touch me...touch me harder"""

24-08-2019T17:17:28,TeapotOfDoom,I need some chocolate
24-08-2019T17:17:29,TeapotOfDoom,brb
24-08-2019T17:17:38,FloofyCat,The real reason it is like that is because it was a lazy-ass plot device that isn't consistent with any reality.

24-08-2019T17:19:23,TeapotOfDoom,also back with sweets
24-08-2019T17:19:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera has a thing for tummy rubs

24-08-2019T17:21:43,FloofyCat,"But he'll figure it out, somehow!"
24-08-2019T17:21:43,CrimsonQuill,Reni is adorable.
24-08-2019T17:21:45,SpazztasticKiwi,“get away from me”
24-08-2019T17:21:45,ShamusTheFox,Mother Nature and I are on a trial separation.
24-08-2019T17:21:47,Sclimshady,Kiinky

24-08-2019T17:22:32,Sclimshady,Caught double red handed
24-08-2019T17:22:32,CrimsonQuill,It's like Gaspode the Wonder Dog from Discworld.
24-08-2019T17:22:33,Sammit,Hi Kita
24-08-2019T17:22:34,KiTA,So what did I miss? :)  And what all won?

24-08-2019T17:22:37,CrimsonQuill,'Woof Bloody Woof.'
24-08-2019T17:22:41,ShadowedHand,You know something’s up when the dog barks telepathically.
24-08-2019T17:22:50,SpazztasticKiwi,ok I like this but how did the Colin/Potts species swap do?
24-08-2019T17:22:57,Miftox01,"welp, didn´t say much again today, but was nice seeing you guys are all doing good. Gonna go now. Good night everyone :)"

24-08-2019T17:23:28,AnuSekaniArt,"Very cute, like, actually one of your cutest ones yet XD"
24-08-2019T17:23:29,CrimsonQuill,Reni is adorkable
24-08-2019T17:23:34,FenceEqualizer,Dang it Reni you're suppose to actually bork not mentally project it.
24-08-2019T17:23:43,CrimsonQuill,Absolutely Adorkable
24-08-2019T17:23:45,SpazztasticKiwi,I can see this getting colored
24-08-2019T17:23:46,CrimsonQuill,:)
24-08-2019T17:23:56,TeapotOfDoom,And there's the next tick
24-08-2019T17:23:57,Sammit,Very good
24-08-2019T17:23:57,FloofyCat,I genuinely wonder how long Reni would let it go on if Kei was oblivious
24-08-2019T17:24:18,TeapotOfDoom,I'm gonna get a bingo soon at this rate
24-08-2019T17:24:29,FloofyCat,"Awh, I missed the bingo being linked."
24-08-2019T17:24:33,AnuSekaniArt,What bingo card is this I keep hearing about? XD

24-08-2019T17:25:07,FenceEqualizer,My bingo card looking barren right now am missing the right posts
24-08-2019T17:25:20,Sclimshady,"Whoops, that one is partly filled.  Just select a new one"
24-08-2019T17:25:22,CrimsonQuill,anticipates next Tom Pic
24-08-2019T17:25:27,w0lfmare,"Her first mistake was having ""Reni"" written on her collar"

24-08-2019T17:25:44,Sclimshady,I need a mod to delete something
24-08-2019T17:25:45,w0lfmare,Hello!
24-08-2019T17:25:48,Twokinds,I imagine Reni was running surveillance in Edinmire when Kei spotted the dog and ran over to pet.
24-08-2019T17:25:53,Sclimshady,Ho w0lf!! o/
24-08-2019T17:25:55,Twokinds,And then it was too awkward to say anything.
24-08-2019T17:25:59,w0lfmare,XD
24-08-2019T17:26:00,FenceEqualizer,Hey W0lf
24-08-2019T17:26:00,CrimsonQuill,Oh...Oh dear Tom.

24-08-2019T17:26:08,AnuSekaniArt,Brilliant Tom XD
24-08-2019T17:26:09,CrimsonQuill,What sort of Surveillence?
24-08-2019T17:26:16,IronHorseComics,too awkward and totally crushing
24-08-2019T17:26:29,FenceEqualizer,Poor Reni.
24-08-2019T17:26:29,Xexanoth,"""too awkward""?, Reni planned the whole thing :P"

24-08-2019T17:26:44,TeapotOfDoom,Lol spazz you already meantioned him so already got that ticked
24-08-2019T17:26:49,Sclimshady,Yee
24-08-2019T17:26:53,w0lfmare,And she can't tell him she's a dog to spy
24-08-2019T17:26:58,Sclimshady,I didn't make the card
24-08-2019T17:27:07,SpazztasticKiwi,nah I’m saying is he really that much of a staple here
24-08-2019T17:27:08,TeapotOfDoom,me neither
24-08-2019T17:27:16,TeapotOfDoom,yes he definitely is
24-08-2019T17:27:21,FenceEqualizer,Yeeeeeeep
24-08-2019T17:27:22,Sclimshady,But if anyone wants to add it is editable
24-08-2019T17:27:24,SpazztasticKiwi,"“hey Bagheera you’re famous, dear”"
24-08-2019T17:27:27,CrimsonQuill,Here's to hoping that Waterfall kiss is Tominated
24-08-2019T17:27:32,TeapotOfDoom,*meaw*
24-08-2019T17:27:39,Sclimshady,:cat:
24-08-2019T17:27:45,FloofyCat,"I wonder if ""tominated"" is gunna be the new word for it."
24-08-2019T17:27:50,SpazztasticKiwi,heh
24-08-2019T17:27:52,CrimsonQuill,"If not, maybe next pick or next week"
24-08-2019T17:27:55,SpazztasticKiwi,now it is
24-08-2019T17:27:55,CrimsonQuill,I mean month
24-08-2019T17:28:01,CrimsonQuill,We'll see
24-08-2019T17:28:03,Xexanoth,Reni's Plan: Step 1: Turn into Dog Step 2: Get Kei to pet me Step 3: Kei finds out and things are awkward
24-08-2019T17:28:17,CrimsonQuill,I'm going to have to sleep after this one anyhow
24-08-2019T17:28:23,TeapotOfDoom,Step 4: ?
24-08-2019T17:28:28,CrimsonQuill,So I'll just see what it is
24-08-2019T17:28:29,AnuSekaniArt,Profit :P
24-08-2019T17:28:31,TeapotOfDoom,Step 5: Profit
24-08-2019T17:28:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom the dragons can’t just flat out turn invisible can they
24-08-2019T17:28:38,ShamusTheFox,Is there ever a moment where things between Kei and Reni aren't awkward?
24-08-2019T17:28:40,CrimsonQuill,Let the art commence!
24-08-2019T17:28:50,FloofyCat,"If you're a big dragon and humans treat you like royalty, then one comes up and starts patting you, poor nervous Reni would probably be too embarrassed to reveal herself and would let it go on."
24-08-2019T17:28:52,CrimsonQuill,Basitins? Keidran? Humans? Doggos?
24-08-2019T17:28:54,CrimsonQuill,XD
24-08-2019T17:28:54,falangie123,guys how do i come out to my friends as a furry? i need your advice
24-08-2019T17:29:05,CrimsonQuill,I'm going to go fullscreen for a bit
24-08-2019T17:29:12,FenceEqualizer,Reni fate was sealed when she said Kei was cute. There is no escape
24-08-2019T17:29:24,Sclimshady,Do or don't thats about it dude
24-08-2019T17:29:25,FloofyCat,IT'S THAT ONE CHARACTER FROM PAGE... 50?
24-08-2019T17:29:31,FenceEqualizer,falangie123 uhh...don't
24-08-2019T17:29:39,CrimsonQuill,Actually
24-08-2019T17:29:46,falangie123,so i should keep it a secret??
24-08-2019T17:29:51,CrimsonQuill,Dragon Doggos might end up being a series
24-08-2019T17:29:57,CrimsonQuill,That'd be interesting
24-08-2019T17:30:04,TeapotOfDoom,That's a thing only you can decide
24-08-2019T17:30:10,FloofyCat,Depends on the friend
24-08-2019T17:30:11,FenceEqualizer,Like you being a furry has no impact on anyones life. If you don't feel comfortable talking about it then don't.
24-08-2019T17:30:17,TeapotOfDoom,Agree with Floofy
24-08-2019T17:30:22,falangie123,i hate deciding
24-08-2019T17:30:29,Sclimshady,Time to give my kitty drugs
24-08-2019T17:30:33,ShamusTheFox,"I waited for my friends to say something vaguely insulting about furries, and then I pulled the, ""Oh by the way"" card."
24-08-2019T17:30:40,PalmettoPathfinder1,@falangie123 you could just say that you like anthropomorphic characters and say you find them interesting.
24-08-2019T17:30:42,FloofyCat,"I haven't ever told any real life people, but a few kinda figured it out."
24-08-2019T17:30:51,TeapotOfDoom,Lol shamus good plan
24-08-2019T17:30:54,AnuSekaniArt,Same Floofy
24-08-2019T17:31:02,FloofyCat,I never mention it and they don't so its all good.
24-08-2019T17:31:07,AnuSekaniArt,Same
24-08-2019T17:31:13,CrimsonQuill,I see a Raine
24-08-2019T17:31:25,Sclimshady,It kinda happened when my buddy came out as trans and we all started sharing to make her feel more comfortable
24-08-2019T17:31:26,CrimsonQuill,I am absolutely terrified of making my Halo Raine Reference sheet
24-08-2019T17:31:38,CrimsonQuill,Because...well...she's quite tricky to draw.

24-08-2019T17:31:56,ShamusTheFox,"TeapotOfDoom, I look at it as a life lesson. And that lesson is, you never know."
24-08-2019T17:32:07,CrimsonQuill,A Raine or a Mary
24-08-2019T17:32:08,falangie123,the awkward thing is i make fun of my friend for liking anime
24-08-2019T17:32:10,CrimsonQuill,Either Or
24-08-2019T17:32:16,Zakuru,nope..
24-08-2019T17:32:18,falangie123,but here i am reading twokinds for the last 3 years
24-08-2019T17:32:21,TeapotOfDoom,Ooooh
24-08-2019T17:32:26,TeapotOfDoom,you would not beleive
24-08-2019T17:32:28,TeapotOfDoom,lol
24-08-2019T17:32:40,falangie123,so basically I'm a hypocrite
24-08-2019T17:32:54,TeapotOfDoom,I have a friend who i make fun of being a weeb and he teases me for being a furry
24-08-2019T17:32:59,iliar,Human Nora?!

24-08-2019T17:33:02,iliar,Nice!
24-08-2019T17:33:02,CrimsonQuill,It's Nora

24-08-2019T17:33:07,falangie123,woo nora
24-08-2019T17:33:09,CrimsonQuill,Dammit
24-08-2019T17:33:21,CrimsonQuill,It kinda looked like Raine or Mary at first
24-08-2019T17:33:28,CrimsonHelsing,"Huh, had me excited for a minute there ;P"
24-08-2019T17:33:36,falangie123,@teapot i need to establish that kind of rapport with my friend i think
24-08-2019T17:33:40,CrimsonQuill,I thought it might be an AU thing or something

24-08-2019T17:33:40,SpazztasticKiwi,who tf is Mary
24-08-2019T17:33:46,CrimsonQuill,Mary Silverlock
24-08-2019T17:33:49,CrimsonQuill,Raine's mum
24-08-2019T17:33:52,TeapotOfDoom,"again, depends on the friend"
24-08-2019T17:33:55,SpazztasticKiwi,when did Tom start drawing Catholic fan art
24-08-2019T17:34:01,NezumiYuki,"Soooooooo... now that I'm sure this is Lady Nora, I gotta know... What is she upto?  xD"

24-08-2019T17:34:20,SpazztasticKiwi,that’s a wizard name
24-08-2019T17:34:29,iliar,Not. She was not like Raine or Mary. She has different ears.
24-08-2019T17:34:29,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m using that for Sims when I get it
24-08-2019T17:34:41,TeapotOfDoom,i'm not even 100% sure he got that I'm not joking about the fur part lol
24-08-2019T17:34:46,CrimsonQuill,I'm absolutely terrified of drawing Raine
24-08-2019T17:34:48,falangie123,ah well he watches bleach so there's no way he can look down on me lol
24-08-2019T17:35:09,ShamusTheFox,"Bleach has a furry in it, so yeah."
24-08-2019T17:35:17,CrimsonQuill,What the heck is Bleach?

24-08-2019T17:37:20,Sclimshady,He has FIV so the shelter was ecstatic when I adopted him
24-08-2019T17:37:25,CrimsonQuill,"All three of them are adorable, but none of them are very comfortable around people."
24-08-2019T17:37:41,Sclimshady,Black and FIV+? he wasn't getting out easily
24-08-2019T17:37:41,CrimsonQuill,Pangur Bán tried to explore the chimney once.
24-08-2019T17:37:51,TeapotOfDoom,Oh just realized those are names quill lol

24-08-2019T17:38:25,CrimsonQuill,It means 'White Panther' in Irish
24-08-2019T17:38:40,CrimsonQuill,It was the name of a monk's cat in the poem of the same name
24-08-2019T17:38:56,CrimsonQuill,And this cat is white all over
24-08-2019T17:39:09,SpazztasticKiwi,other cat names include Captain Cuddlebottom and Sir Furbritches

24-08-2019T18:37:15,FloofyCat,But if you get tailored clothes from Kat
24-08-2019T18:37:26,FloofyCat,You have to then realise you will never find anyone in life that is as wholesome or adorable.
