30-03-2019T13:47:32,RimaDraws,i am not sure. @Twokinds has that one been uploaded yet?
30-03-2019T14:02:14,Twokinds,That was in the artbook
30-03-2019T14:02:22,RimaDraws,yes it was
30-03-2019T14:03:31,ninja7warrior,Oh ok
30-03-2019T14:16:45,ninja7warrior,Does that mean you wont upload any of the art that was in the artbook?
30-03-2019T14:16:57,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-ohmy: butt
30-03-2019T14:17:01,Bgrmystr2,also gmornin
30-03-2019T14:17:17,Bgrmystr2,"you have to pay for the artbook ninja, so obviously not"
30-03-2019T14:18:58,Twokinds,Yeah the artbook is one of the few things I keep as purely physical
30-03-2019T14:19:18,RimaDraws,i love the artbook.
30-03-2019T14:19:52,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: Digital artbook one of these days..? I can hope.
30-03-2019T14:19:53,ninja7warrior,Oh ok
30-03-2019T14:20:52,Twokinds,I'm hoping to do Artbook v2
30-03-2019T14:21:14,Twokinds,But drawing enough new art for 120 pages takes a long time
30-03-2019T14:21:34,iliar,Although I think it is not convenient. I rarely home and would like to have a copy of all the content in digital form.
30-03-2019T14:22:08,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, ya can't wallpaper a book"
30-03-2019T14:22:13,Bgrmystr2,"or poster, even"
30-03-2019T14:22:28,Bgrmystr2,or anything like that.
30-03-2019T14:23:51,RimaDraws,oooh artbook two will be good.
30-03-2019T14:27:05,RimaDraws,i am a sucker for physical copies
30-03-2019T14:28:42,Twokinds,The color poll was interesting
30-03-2019T14:29:12,Twokinds,"All were very close, nothing was a huge runaway winner"
30-03-2019T14:29:17,SomeOtherTom,There were a lot of great choices this time round.
30-03-2019T14:30:05,RimaDraws,yea there were. alot of good ones.

30-03-2019T14:30:59,BadFoMo,I don't think it was a sketch request.
30-03-2019T14:31:14,Bgrmystr2,it wasn't
30-03-2019T14:31:22,Bgrmystr2,Probably why it wasn't there
30-03-2019T14:31:31,RimaDraws,^
30-03-2019T14:31:36,RimaDraws,it still looked good either way

30-03-2019T14:31:52,RimaDraws,its fine.

30-03-2019T14:31:57,Twokinds,"Yeah not a regular sunday sketch... though it was posted on a sunday, so technically... lol"
30-03-2019T14:32:38,Bgrmystr2,it wasn't a requested sunday sketch. It's not like we haven't seen tigerbutt before :u

30-03-2019T15:02:01,Bgrmystr2,The guys that go to urinals have come to terms with doing so in a semi-public place.
30-03-2019T15:02:08,Bgrmystr2,so that's not surprising at all.
30-03-2019T15:02:40,Mippy,a
30-03-2019T15:02:51,SpazztasticKiwi,what about self respect

30-03-2019T15:03:29,Bgrmystr2,I don't think self-respect comes into the picture? Iunno
30-03-2019T15:03:59,InTheLionsDen,When the bladder screams self respect takes the back seat.
30-03-2019T15:04:00,Bgrmystr2,"being okay with that doesn't equate to lack of self-respect, it simply equates to more openness about public places"
30-03-2019T15:05:10,BadFoMo,Why do we bother with Urinals anyway? You cant... shouldn't crap in them like a Toilet.
30-03-2019T15:05:23,RimaDraws,lol
30-03-2019T15:05:24,RimaDraws,wut
30-03-2019T15:05:44,CrRAR,Yeah it seems weird to have that one appliace for the singular purpose.
30-03-2019T15:06:00,Mippy,Who wants to poo in a urinal
30-03-2019T15:06:09,InTheLionsDen,They use less water and take up less space than a toilet.

30-03-2019T15:06:45,BadFoMo,@RimaDraws I remember seeing a pic of what looked like that.
30-03-2019T15:06:48,Mippy,Honestly...we should work on getting more stalls in women's washrooms. Or female urinals or something

30-03-2019T16:33:04,Bgrmystr2,one*
30-03-2019T16:33:06,MuonNeutrino,the actual odd thing is that the tail is missing on the facing away shot

30-03-2019T16:34:15,NathanINS,Lmao
30-03-2019T16:34:53,Dimensional,But the tails are there for balance on those digitgrade legs. XD
30-03-2019T16:35:05,NathanINS,Seeing as last comic WAS abt her wolf form trying to assert dominance
30-03-2019T16:35:16,GamerCent,XD
30-03-2019T16:35:19,Mippy,She falls forward a moment later
30-03-2019T16:36:00,GamerCent,where is her tail?
30-03-2019T16:36:19,MuonNeutrino,perhaps tom left it out so you can see her legs? is kinda the point of a ref sheet after all
30-03-2019T16:36:36,Mippy,^ that
30-03-2019T16:37:11,BadFoMo,Raine's tail in the third pic? She 'gave' it to Red for a bit.

30-03-2019T20:05:28,MarvTheHugPharaoh,it does that every day for me
30-03-2019T20:06:12,Dadrobit,Initially I was thinking something along the lines of them having their picture shot at the apex of a roller coaster or something. Where Zen is the one freaking and Raine is chuckling trying to comfort him.
30-03-2019T20:06:33,MarvTheHugPharaoh,that sounds adorable
30-03-2019T20:06:42,unsteddyphoenix,"I feel like theyd both be freaking out, really"
30-03-2019T20:07:05,Dadrobit,"Yeah, that'd probably be canonically accurate. But that's really not my style."

30-03-2019T20:07:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,saw that where someone put the windows boot and turn off sounds over it
30-03-2019T20:07:45,Dadrobit,"I mean, I'm the dude that get's Sythe riding giant Nibbs and Maddie in a wind tunnel."
30-03-2019T20:07:53,Dadrobit,gets*
30-03-2019T20:07:56,unsteddyphoenix,I love that video spazz lol
30-03-2019T20:09:22,Dadrobit,"Oh, and the musclehead general in an elf costume. Though I like to think there was some amount of canonical accuracy to that."
30-03-2019T20:09:39,Ordithus,Aside from being an AU already
30-03-2019T20:09:47,Dadrobit,Even though it was Zen/Natani as kids being raised in the AU by the King.
30-03-2019T20:10:06,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"King, best wolf mom"
30-03-2019T20:10:13,Dadrobit,S'what they all did for Kiddo Maddie! :D

30-03-2019T20:12:10,SpazztasticKiwi,You seen the not to be racist vine?
30-03-2019T20:12:23,SpazztasticKiwi,That one gets me
30-03-2019T20:12:35,MarvTheHugPharaoh,the girl with the kaiju roar at the end?
30-03-2019T20:12:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Just because I can’t understand the sound she makes
30-03-2019T20:12:52,SpazztasticKiwi,My brain just can’t compute
30-03-2019T20:12:56,Dadrobit,"OH fuck Marv, that's great"
30-03-2019T20:13:02,SpazztasticKiwi,But I know it’s not human
30-03-2019T20:13:30,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s nice Mark had a similar reaction
30-03-2019T20:13:44,MarvTheHugPharaoh,She's definitely not of this earth
30-03-2019T20:16:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Remember the high as the us space station guy
30-03-2019T20:16:29,SpazztasticKiwi,“...............am I talking to me?”

30-03-2019T20:17:53,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I love that one
30-03-2019T20:18:01,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Just the ""Ahhh"" at the very end kills me"
30-03-2019T20:18:25,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s so well timed I feel God was like “you wanna play?”
30-03-2019T20:18:46,Dadrobit,I'm trying to see if I can rip that and find a good kaiju roar to put it over.
30-03-2019T20:19:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Plz do
30-03-2019T20:19:08,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I know of a few Kaijus you can borrow from
30-03-2019T20:19:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Add fire
30-03-2019T20:19:36,SpazztasticKiwi,What I don’t get are the two guys that play “run at each other and combine crotches mid air”
30-03-2019T20:20:01,SpazztasticKiwi,“flying nut high five” think it is
30-03-2019T20:20:49,Dadrobit,It's a guy thing.
30-03-2019T20:21:04,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Dad, Gigan 2004"
30-03-2019T20:22:58,Dadrobit,I was looking for a good scene as well. Was thinking of this. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3Oo5sbgyQE&t=6m0s
30-03-2019T20:25:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Mmmmmmm
30-03-2019T20:25:30,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Thats a good one, be sure to check this one out too https://youtu.be/xbB9GBykZAA?t=19"
30-03-2019T20:25:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe something more Godzilla
30-03-2019T20:26:10,Dadrobit,Holy hell that's a long roar.
30-03-2019T20:26:20,SpazztasticKiwi,If we can mix those two and up the pitch
30-03-2019T20:26:22,Dadrobit,"Also, RIP Pro Tools is updating."
30-03-2019T20:26:32,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"I saw in theaters, made my clothes moves with the bass"
30-03-2019T20:26:41,SpazztasticKiwi,And of course you gotta add fire
30-03-2019T20:27:14,Dadrobit,"Nah, I'm gonna try and get Kaiju-speak solely from this girl's roar."
30-03-2019T20:27:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I might try that godzilla movie comin out
30-03-2019T20:27:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Still need to get a copy of the meg
30-03-2019T20:27:54,Dadrobit,The Meg was great
30-03-2019T20:27:58,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Dude, the new Godzilla looks so hype"
30-03-2019T20:28:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Big monsters
30-03-2019T20:28:31,Dadrobit,I think a lotta folks went too hard on The Meg. Viewing it as a big budget B Movie makes it so much better.
30-03-2019T20:28:58,Dadrobit,"Also yes, Saw a trailer for the new Godzilla, looks very lit."
30-03-2019T20:29:24,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s another shark movie about megaladon. Doesn’t mean it’s bad just for being so
30-03-2019T20:29:49,SpazztasticKiwi,"Speaking of sharks, they found Rosie a new home"

30-03-2019T21:41:50,CrRAR,"Ooo, mystery man~ lol"
30-03-2019T21:42:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Which brings up the question why some people see sharp tooth tall and long fingered demons chasing them
30-03-2019T21:42:46,CrRAR,"Well, I suppose it's a mind's assemblage of demon-y traits?"
30-03-2019T21:43:18,CrRAR,I mean the brain keeps a fun little library of things that terrify it. Secretly.
