23-12-2019T13:19:46,RimaDraws,merry christmas eve
23-12-2019T13:23:48,AspiringNoodle,Anyone else have a fun weekend?
23-12-2019T13:24:42,RimaDraws,well i am sick but i am ok
23-12-2019T13:27:26,AspiringNoodle,"Awwww, get better soon!"
23-12-2019T13:27:38,AspiringNoodle,I... uh... I think I finally quit Apex Legends for the last time :ptv-uneasy:
23-12-2019T13:28:19,RimaDraws,aw why
23-12-2019T13:29:06,AspiringNoodle,"I have my minor complaints overall about the game, but it's been out for how long and is still super unstable?"
23-12-2019T13:29:50,AspiringNoodle,"Yesterday, the game crashed under 3 different errors.  1 was a texture failed to load, 1 was DEVICE_HUNG (aka lost the video card), and the infamous CODE:LEAF"
23-12-2019T13:30:27,AspiringNoodle,"Like... I knew CODE:LEAF affected console players (seriously, even the console version isn't completely stable), but it affects PC as well??"
23-12-2019T13:30:37,RimaDraws,oh
23-12-2019T13:31:08,AspiringNoodle,I'm only interested in the game at all anymore because of ranked and any fun seasonal events
23-12-2019T13:31:51,AspiringNoodle,"But it's impossible to climb higher right now due to how crash prone it is.  And they don't have a reconnect feature so if you disconnect for ANY reason, that match is done and if you didn't earn back your RP, well, tough shite"
23-12-2019T13:35:56,AspiringNoodle,"Btw, sunk 125 hours into the game, I'm pretty sure my complaints are valid at this point xD"
23-12-2019T13:36:18,AspiringNoodle,"Oh, the wasted time ;_;"
23-12-2019T14:34:05,JojoF2415,Merry early Christmas
23-12-2019T14:35:19,ThingsAreMoving,"It's not wasted time, if you had fun while playing, Noodle."
23-12-2019T14:36:44,ThingsAreMoving,"Also, I think the rumors about humans having a second stomach dedicated solely for dessert may be true. So much cake..."
