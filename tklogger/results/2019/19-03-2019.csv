19-03-2019T10:43:06,Twokinds,I keep getting mental characteristics and personality mixed up
19-03-2019T10:43:31,Twokinds,"Obviously one is what someone knows and what skills they have, while the other is how they act. But sometimes there is overlap."
19-03-2019T10:47:42,Twokinds,"Is kindness a mental characteristic or a personality trait? A person can act kind, but they can also be naturally inclinded to be kind."
19-03-2019T10:49:34,Azumachan,I'd say mindset.
19-03-2019T10:49:53,Azumachan,So Mental characteristic.
19-03-2019T10:53:07,unsteddyphoenix,"Theres ""being kind""andthen theres ""being peceived as kind"""
19-03-2019T10:53:26,unsteddyphoenix,The right oneis more of a skill than the left

19-03-2019T11:12:37,Xexanoth,"eh, i'd put kindness as personality trait, because you usually only perceive people as kind when they actually do/say kind stuff"
19-03-2019T11:21:07,Dadrobit,"Could be a sociopath though. Someone who literally ""acts"" kind in order to been seen as such and gain their trust."
19-03-2019T11:25:17,Xexanoth,"well, then you'd put something like ""his kindness is just an act"" or something as personality."
19-03-2019T11:27:07,Xexanoth,"imo i would put anything that is about how a person beahves/acts towards other as personality, whereas ""characteristics"" would be more passive stuff"
19-03-2019T11:27:52,Xexanoth,"someone having a good memory or being good at math would be a mental characteristic, while being brash/violent/kind would be personality."

19-03-2019T12:43:20,Twokinds,Though I might use ghost laura in a magical mishap side comic one day.
19-03-2019T12:43:27,Twokinds,That's the side comic canon though.

19-03-2019T13:37:38,CrimsonQuill,The visit took the group I was with 350m underground.

19-03-2019T13:48:18,Mippy,Best way to beat art block: just draw.
19-03-2019T13:48:31,CrimsonQuill,"Well, I've drawn a house."
19-03-2019T13:48:44,CrimsonQuill,Now I actually want to figure out what sort of person Julia Custodes is.
19-03-2019T13:48:53,CrimsonQuill,Then i can make her a character sheet.
19-03-2019T13:50:27,Mippy,"See, now keep going with that"
19-03-2019T13:51:32,CrimsonQuill,I always keep a 2 drawing backlog anyhow for a fortnight..

19-03-2019T19:30:22,Bgrmystr2,"once I learn a name, it's prettymuch there forever.. mostly."
19-03-2019T19:31:29,Bgrmystr2,I can remember IGNs from my friends back 14-15 years ago..
19-03-2019T19:31:34,Dadrobit,"I don't even always remember the names of all my nieces and nephews. I just call them all ""kiddo"" when I forget. They think it's endearing. Turns out I'm a shit uncle."
19-03-2019T19:31:43,Bgrmystr2,haha
19-03-2019T19:31:51,Bgrmystr2,can't win em all
19-03-2019T19:31:53,RimaDraws,hi bgr
19-03-2019T19:33:06,Twokinds,Yah Kei's long name is confusing
19-03-2019T19:33:36,Twokinds,It's mostly because of Kei & Keidran.
19-03-2019T19:33:49,Dadrobit,"That's why I just call him by his proper title of ""Best Character""."
19-03-2019T19:34:11,Twokinds,Kei means beast in old human.
19-03-2019T19:34:22,Dadrobit,"Oh, and then there's Keith. So when you type out Kei, people think you're just shit at spelling Keith."
19-03-2019T19:34:52,unsteddyphoenix,beast human then
19-03-2019T19:34:55,Twokinds,Keidran means beast people. Keiren means hunter.
19-03-2019T19:35:10,unsteddyphoenix,Beast...hunter? Uh oh
19-03-2019T19:35:15,Twokinds,"So, Kei's name is Hunter."
19-03-2019T19:35:44,unsteddyphoenix,"Coming soon: Hunter character named ""Guard"""
19-03-2019T19:35:47,Dadrobit,"HA, and Hunter is befriending a Dragon."
19-03-2019T19:35:57,Bigboi182,Wouldn't be suprised
19-03-2019T19:36:44,Dadrobit,"Flora is suspiciously close to Elora. Now the question becomes, ""Who's Sparx?"""
19-03-2019T19:37:38,unsteddyphoenix,From Spyro?
19-03-2019T19:37:54,Dadrobit,Thank God someone gets me...
19-03-2019T19:38:07,unsteddyphoenix,nailed it :ptv-dealwithit:
19-03-2019T19:38:15,Bgrmystr2,"sorry, never owned it xD"
19-03-2019T19:38:22,Bgrmystr2,or played it
19-03-2019T19:39:29,Dadrobit,Childhood classic trilogy. And the recent remaster was spectacularly done.
19-03-2019T19:40:29,Dadrobit,Except for one bug one one part of one level in the third game.
19-03-2019T19:41:03,Dadrobit,Some kind of memory leak made the framerates tank if you played the mini-game for too long.
19-03-2019T19:41:59,iliar,"About names. Tom, did you have names for human explorer and chief's son."

19-03-2019T19:43:06,Dadrobit,I feel that on a deeper level
19-03-2019T19:43:49,unsteddyphoenix,"""Tom what is the 37th tiger in line called?"""
19-03-2019T19:43:51,Bgrmystr2,haha yes phoenix

19-03-2019T20:03:05,unsteddyphoenix,So pretty and dramatic~
19-03-2019T20:03:10,Twokinds,Uh no no name for the explorer people
19-03-2019T20:04:30,Dadrobit,"""No, no. I refuse to give the suggesters any more fuel!"""
19-03-2019T20:05:29,RimaDraws,i love that one too
19-03-2019T20:05:40,Dadrobit,It was cute though.
19-03-2019T20:05:49,Twokinds,"I just looked at how many is left, and it's almost done."
19-03-2019T20:05:57,Twokinds,6 more hours.
19-03-2019T20:06:08,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-excited:
19-03-2019T20:06:15,Bgrmystr2,is it the bot doing it?
19-03-2019T20:06:28,Bgrmystr2,or is there like an auto-update feature for DA
19-03-2019T20:06:58,Dadrobit,Grats on the spring cleaning!
19-03-2019T20:07:23,Twokinds,dA has an autoposting feature
19-03-2019T20:07:28,Bgrmystr2,ah neat
19-03-2019T20:08:09,RimaDraws,^^ sounds good tom
19-03-2019T20:08:09,Dadrobit,"Huh, is the ""one per hour"" a feature to prevent spam I'm guessing?"
19-03-2019T20:08:47,Twokinds,Yeah
19-03-2019T20:09:06,Twokinds,"I mean I'm not sure if it's better or not, but I figure one per hour is probably better than 1 per minute"
19-03-2019T20:09:12,Twokinds,For the people watching my dA XD
19-03-2019T20:09:17,Twokinds,I dunno
19-03-2019T20:09:36,Twokinds,I could do one per day but then it'd take forever.
19-03-2019T20:09:38,RimaDraws,well i went to bed came back today after class o.o
19-03-2019T20:09:41,Twokinds,And I want these all done.
19-03-2019T20:09:51,RimaDraws,they look great!
19-03-2019T20:10:51,unsteddyphoenix,So is it just like. Selecting all the ones from a folder and uploading them
19-03-2019T20:11:08,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I definitely get that wanting it all done. I imagine you get a lot of flak (read: critique) comments asking about ""When/where's this picture on DA? Haven't you done it yet???"""
19-03-2019T20:12:28,unsteddyphoenix,Hell we see that in here sometimes
19-03-2019T20:13:00,RimaDraws,also tom i figured out a style id want for my comic and it came to me last night when i drew this https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/486633926408929281/557775386302480385/image0.jpg
19-03-2019T20:13:11,Dadrobit,cute!

19-03-2019T20:13:48,unsteddyphoenix,Well styled
19-03-2019T20:14:39,Dadrobit,"And yeah, it leaks in here for sure from time to time."
19-03-2019T20:14:40,RimaDraws,thank you. i wanted something reasonable but very.....shoujo ish
19-03-2019T20:18:44,unsteddyphoenix,Shoujou is girl manga right?
19-03-2019T20:19:01,unsteddyphoenix,"It looks like it'd be quick to draw too, which is good"
19-03-2019T20:19:10,RimaDraws,yea i am used to drawing that style
19-03-2019T20:19:32,RimaDraws,i cant wait to see how i draw and evolve the characters soon

19-03-2019T22:10:41,SpazztasticKiwi,How deep a cut you think it needs to be before you need stitches
19-03-2019T22:16:05,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock:
19-03-2019T22:18:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I stepped on a chunk of glass
19-03-2019T22:19:06,Dadrobit,Generally anything longer than 3/4 an inch I'd say. Also anything that is close to a major joint that is in constant motion like on the knee or elbow may want stitches. You may also take into consideration the depth. Those cuts that reveal internal
19-03-2019T22:19:22,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s one of my toes
19-03-2019T22:19:28,Dadrobit,structures like muscle or fat because the entire dermal layer is compromised may need stitches.
19-03-2019T22:19:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Sorta at the end joint
19-03-2019T22:20:14,Bgrmystr2,You should absolutely get it looked at
19-03-2019T22:20:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Wanna try telling my mother than
19-03-2019T22:20:39,Dadrobit,"That's something that I'd go by depth. Was it an inch long shard that impaled your toe, or was it just a sharp chunk that scratched it."
19-03-2019T22:20:54,Bgrmystr2,yeah what he said ^
19-03-2019T22:20:57,SpazztasticKiwi,It went between the toes
19-03-2019T22:21:10,SpazztasticKiwi,I got a gash on the side of the tow
19-03-2019T22:21:10,Bgrmystr2,"ow, I bet that hurt"
19-03-2019T22:21:28,SpazztasticKiwi,The other toe has a tiny lil nick
19-03-2019T22:21:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Can’t see anything concerning. But it’s steady flowin
19-03-2019T22:22:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Well it was before I pressed it
19-03-2019T22:22:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Now it’s wrapped to see if it’ll stop
19-03-2019T22:22:36,Dadrobit,"Honestly, stuff some gauze between the toes and tape them together with some decent pressure. Wait a couple 10 minutes or so and then open it back up. If it's still bleeding profusely, go see a doctor."
19-03-2019T22:22:53,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s what my mothers wanting me to do
19-03-2019T22:23:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Which no insurance means it’s what I have to go with
19-03-2019T22:23:59,Bgrmystr2,yeah that's a safe bet. Any cut like that you should still go see a doctor regardless. In case it cut something rather important
19-03-2019T22:24:26,Bgrmystr2,how do you not have medical? Does walmart not give medical to workers?
19-03-2019T22:24:49,SpazztasticKiwi,You have to file for it at a certain time of the year
19-03-2019T22:24:55,SpazztasticKiwi,And meet the requirements
19-03-2019T22:25:18,Bgrmystr2,what in fuck kinda horseshit is that lol
19-03-2019T22:25:20,Bgrmystr2,xD
19-03-2019T22:25:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Corporate logic
19-03-2019T22:25:31,SpazztasticKiwi,That kind
19-03-2019T22:25:51,Bgrmystr2,it's supposed to give you medical when you join.
19-03-2019T22:26:11,Bgrmystr2,"like, as soon as they hire you, you do paperwork for that shit"
19-03-2019T22:27:32,Dadrobit,"As a man with no medical at the moment, I know that feel. Accidentally stabbed myself a few months back in the wrist with a knife while I was doing dishes and it bled like a mofo, split skin, visible muscle, the whole nine yards."
19-03-2019T22:28:18,Dadrobit,Ended up just washing it out and putting pressure on it for a good while until it stopped oozing enough to steri-strip the skin together.
19-03-2019T22:28:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Yes well this stepping on shit thing is so common for me I’m debating wearing shoes nonstop
19-03-2019T22:28:42,Dadrobit,"Was not fun, probably shoulda gotten a stitch or two. But money yo...."
19-03-2019T22:29:58,Dadrobit,https://i.imgur.com/wUlWWf8.jpg It shrunk down and healed up nicely though!
19-03-2019T22:30:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Hold your breath. It may have stopped
19-03-2019T22:30:41,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-confused:
19-03-2019T22:30:48,Bgrmystr2,I can hope.

19-03-2019T22:31:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I still have a picture from when that aquarium busted under my hands
19-03-2019T22:31:21,SpazztasticKiwi,hand
19-03-2019T22:33:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Ok good news is I can see the actual gash now
19-03-2019T22:34:59,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s not terribly long but I’m not sure how deep
19-03-2019T22:35:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Though i also can’t see anything concerning
19-03-2019T22:36:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I will say I gracefully dribbled blood all over my bathroom floor
19-03-2019T22:38:08,Bgrmystr2,"In b4 ""I am now gracefully bleeding to death"" after finding out it cut somethin important"
19-03-2019T22:40:17,SpazztasticKiwi,My name means graceful you know
19-03-2019T22:40:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Look how that works out
19-03-2019T22:40:46,Bgrmystr2,> Spazztastic :ptv-wondering:
19-03-2019T22:40:55,Bgrmystr2,yes. Graceful.
19-03-2019T22:52:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m just gonna go back to my streaming now that mess is done

19-03-2019T23:07:19,Bgrmystr2,I do not recommend them.
19-03-2019T23:07:21,Bgrmystr2,At all
19-03-2019T23:07:54,Bgrmystr2,I was recommended them when I had surgery on both of my toes
