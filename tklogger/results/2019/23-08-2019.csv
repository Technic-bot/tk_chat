23-08-2019T01:54:35,Sclimshady,Real dangerous school
23-08-2019T01:55:01,Sclimshady,The nice shooting muffs?
23-08-2019T01:55:22,Dadrobit,"Marv, go to Dicks Sporting and get yourself a small tent. Very similar feeling."
23-08-2019T01:55:28,Sclimshady,The good ones do work like that
23-08-2019T01:55:43,Sclimshady,Just expensive
23-08-2019T01:55:46,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Legit, been wanting a single person tent for a while now."
23-08-2019T01:56:04,MarvTheHugPharaoh,just to have in case I need to bug out
23-08-2019T01:56:06,Sclimshady,I have 3 hammocks and a one person tent
23-08-2019T01:56:23,Sclimshady,The hammocks were on sale
23-08-2019T01:56:33,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"I have a 4 person ""Insta"" tent, but I want something smaller for the cozies"
23-08-2019T01:57:22,Sclimshady,My hammocks are 2 person :ctwokinds-NoraEyebrows:
23-08-2019T01:57:35,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:eyes::sweat_drops:
23-08-2019T01:57:52,Dadrobit,"Mmmm, when I was in the boy scouts, I had a tiny one person tent. It was just a 24"" tall, 6' long triangle. Very cozy for sure."
23-08-2019T01:58:32,Dadrobit,And super lightweight so backpacking with it was super easy.
23-08-2019T01:59:10,Dadrobit,'Least compared to the kids that brought their house sized ones with them.
23-08-2019T01:59:25,Sclimshady,Just got a text that cows are blocking the freeway near me
23-08-2019T01:59:28,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Something small like that would be great.  Just to tie it to the back of my endure and ride off into the woods
23-08-2019T02:02:37,Dadrobit,"Dang, now I just want to pack my little Focus up and head on into the Mogollon Rim for a weekend with the puppy..."
23-08-2019T02:02:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Yo, signs was a scary movie I don't blame you Lann"

23-08-2019T02:06:14,Sclimshady,"Your toes, shoot them over!"
23-08-2019T02:06:56,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Something is popping off outside, there was like 6 different sirens rolling down the road behind my house"

23-08-2019T02:13:21,Sclimshady,It did look real good there
23-08-2019T02:14:01,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"It sucked to do tbh, took a very long time to paint it on."
23-08-2019T02:15:19,Sclimshady,Worth it though
23-08-2019T02:15:34,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"yee, wish you luck on the shading my dude."

23-08-2019T02:23:10,BadFoMo,"I'm the same way in Minecraft. ""My greed is going to be the death of me.""."
23-08-2019T02:23:28,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Dark souls greed kills all
23-08-2019T02:23:49,Sclimshady,The old hand in a pickle jar problem
23-08-2019T02:25:16,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Lann you missed because you were shooting at where he's at, not where he was going."
23-08-2019T02:25:39,Sclimshady,Excuses
23-08-2019T02:25:57,MarvTheHugPharaoh,The lights also told your location.

23-08-2019T02:30:29,Sclimshady,Put all the letters backwards
23-08-2019T02:30:34,Sclimshady,Tarkov
23-08-2019T02:31:20,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Is it not on steam?
23-08-2019T02:31:42,Sclimshady,On the webs only
23-08-2019T02:31:49,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Ah
23-08-2019T02:32:19,Sclimshady,Wb
23-08-2019T02:32:51,MarvTheHugPharaoh,WB sage
23-08-2019T02:34:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nighty night Lann.

23-08-2019T02:34:30,BadFoMo,Good night.
23-08-2019T02:34:32,Sclimshady,"Night Lann, thanks for the stream o/"
23-08-2019T02:34:50,MarvTheHugPharaoh,And then there was Sage.
23-08-2019T02:37:12,SageSaga,as usual right?
23-08-2019T02:37:36,Sclimshady,The marathon runner
23-08-2019T02:37:51,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"yep, but I like the later part of the Friday streams.  Nice and chill"
23-08-2019T02:38:15,Sclimshady,You can buy Tarkov with cash
23-08-2019T02:38:21,Sclimshady,????
23-08-2019T02:38:38,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Like with carrier pigeon?
23-08-2019T02:38:54,Sclimshady,"I sure hope so, now I wanna do it"
23-08-2019T02:39:30,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"A raven knocks on the window. ""I'm from Tarkov, give me the cash."""
23-08-2019T02:39:38,BadFoMo,But all I have are Pre-War Bullets!
23-08-2019T02:39:58,Sclimshady,"Hmm,  you could use caps"
23-08-2019T02:40:51,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"""If you don't have cash, then first born son."""
23-08-2019T02:42:09,Sclimshady,"Deal, I don't want him"
23-08-2019T02:42:56,SageSaga,oof
23-08-2019T02:44:53,Sclimshady,He knows what he is gonna do
23-08-2019T02:45:52,SageSaga,you are screwed if you get in a Dororo situation
23-08-2019T02:47:22,Sclimshady,I'm screwed in a lot of ways
23-08-2019T02:47:47,Dadrobit,Except the fun way.
23-08-2019T02:48:07,Sclimshady,Exactly ;-;
23-08-2019T02:48:51,SageSaga,it would be just your luck though to give your first born to a demon only for the demon to fail at taking every part of him- and the boy grows up to slay demons
23-08-2019T02:49:14,SageSaga,finds out daddy didnt love him and is responsible for his misery-
23-08-2019T02:49:32,Sclimshady,"Is this the anime Hercules, except for the last part"
23-08-2019T02:50:33,Dadrobit,"""Anime Hercules"""
23-08-2019T02:50:51,Sclimshady,I said what I said
23-08-2019T02:51:02,SageSaga,"this man made a deal with a bunch of demons - and the demons took the childs skin, eyes, ears, tongue, legs and arms- so just the skinless head and torso remained- and yet the boys spirit clung to life"
23-08-2019T02:51:19,Sclimshady,Eww
23-08-2019T02:51:38,Dadrobit,It's just a fleshwound - that baby probably
23-08-2019T02:51:40,SageSaga,"he ended up in the hands of a prosthetic builder who built him a body- and the boys soul allowed him to ""see"" other souls"
23-08-2019T02:52:20,Sclimshady,Kool
23-08-2019T02:52:24,SageSaga,monsters were drawn to him and he learned to murder them- and eventually killed one that took part of him- and he got it back
23-08-2019T02:52:26,Dadrobit,That's kinda the premise for a show on Netflix.
23-08-2019T02:52:42,SageSaga,so hes murdering the filthy beasts that took his body and is taking it back
23-08-2019T02:53:06,Dadrobit,Love. Death. Robots I think it was called.
23-08-2019T02:53:29,SageSaga,nope- Love Death and Robots is a collection of short stories
23-08-2019T02:53:44,Sclimshady,Watchin episode one now
23-08-2019T02:53:57,SageSaga,of?
23-08-2019T02:54:10,Sclimshady,Dororo
23-08-2019T02:54:57,SageSaga,it's pretty good- classic anime type story- not a sad or happy ending really- just an ending XD
23-08-2019T02:54:58,Dadrobit,"Yeah, there was one about a shapes hitting fox lady who had her family killed by demon hunters. She befriends a prosthetics expert who helps rebuild her after another dude cut her to bite and rebuilt her as an Android"
23-08-2019T02:55:08,Dadrobit,Shapeshifting*
23-08-2019T02:55:20,Dadrobit,Bits*
23-08-2019T02:55:24,SageSaga,yeah i remember that one
23-08-2019T02:56:08,Dadrobit,"Wasn't my favorite episode, but it was good."
23-08-2019T02:56:34,SageSaga,Dororo is a story originally made in 1967
23-08-2019T02:56:56,Sclimshady,Is the anime only the season this year?
23-08-2019T02:57:36,SageSaga,the new anime covers pretty much everything
23-08-2019T02:57:53,SageSaga,and it is only one season
23-08-2019T02:57:59,Sclimshady,gotcha
23-08-2019T02:58:51,SageSaga,"""Remember that manga from over 50 years ago?"" ""No"" ""Let's make a new anime out of it"" ""What are you talking about?"""
23-08-2019T02:59:52,Sclimshady,"Old stories are so good, and the new animation does them justice"
23-08-2019T03:02:13,Dadrobit,Food brb

23-08-2019T03:28:59,Sclimshady,Nice Sage!
23-08-2019T03:29:31,SageSaga,she doesnt like how shes talking - like i said- some casual high elf racism XD

23-08-2019T03:35:34,Dadrobit,Back
23-08-2019T03:35:47,Sclimshady,Back too late ;-;
23-08-2019T03:35:55,Dadrobit,Just in time!
23-08-2019T03:36:03,Sclimshady,Or that
23-08-2019T03:36:29,Dadrobit,Was just chilling having lunch with my patrol officer.
23-08-2019T03:36:41,Dadrobit,Talking about video game stuffs.
23-08-2019T03:36:50,Sclimshady,"Nice,  late night lunch is always fun"
23-08-2019T03:37:26,Dadrobit,The life of a graveyard shift worker.
23-08-2019T03:38:08,Sclimshady,"Thats my favorite shift,  I do not like the day."
23-08-2019T03:39:07,Dadrobit,Right now I kinda just want to go home and play some No Man's Sky. Super hyped for the latest update.
23-08-2019T03:39:57,Sclimshady,"I know, I was super disappointed at launch but they really came through"
23-08-2019T03:40:46,Dadrobit,"My patrol dude was one of the ones who hasn't touched it since launch either. I never really hated it myself, but now? It's legitimately just so good."
23-08-2019T03:41:07,Dadrobit,VR takes it a whole nother level.
23-08-2019T03:41:52,Dadrobit,Plus the latest update overhauled a buncha stuff and added even more base building avenues.
23-08-2019T03:41:57,Sclimshady,"Sadly, I had it for ps4 then sold the console.  I'll probably buy it once the last like 3 months of pay finally comes in"
23-08-2019T03:42:24,Dadrobit,And alien milking was added. Can't forget the alien milking.
23-08-2019T03:42:37,Sclimshady,:ctwokinds-reniembarrassed:
23-08-2019T03:42:47,Dadrobit,Eat your heart out Star Citizen
23-08-2019T03:43:24,Sclimshady,Apparently Cyberpunk 2077 might have anthros and i am pretty hype
23-08-2019T03:43:53,Dadrobit,:o
23-08-2019T03:44:01,Dadrobit,"Weird flex, but okay"
23-08-2019T03:44:03,Sclimshady,Just rumor mill stuff atm
23-08-2019T03:44:39,Sclimshady,It is cannon in cyberpunk tho
23-08-2019T03:46:13,Dadrobit,"I mean, I could see it being a thing for sure, but I don't recall seeing it anywhere in any released media so far. Haven't really looked for it either tho."
23-08-2019T03:47:37,Sclimshady,"They are called exotics,  modified people who find animals fashionable or somthin'"
23-08-2019T03:50:18,Dadrobit,Sell anthro mods and a voice pack that turns the player characters' voices into uwu-speak as dlc and they'd make a killing off of the furries..
23-08-2019T03:50:28,Sclimshady,"lol, there is a poll on the website, 57% of people say ""sure, make me an animal"""
23-08-2019T03:51:02,Sclimshady,"Yeah, have you seen Kame play stardew with the anthro NPC mod?"
23-08-2019T03:52:03,Dadrobit,"Nah, can't say I watch anyone here on streams outside of Picarto art. And even then just Tom and a bit Sage with some w0lf to taste."
23-08-2019T03:53:17,Sclimshady,"He does it on Picarto,  some super nice art too."
23-08-2019T03:54:43,Dadrobit,"I've caught Kame a few times arting, (I think I'm subscribed?) but I just don't have the time to watch streams. Barely even catch Tom and he's the one that got me into this."
23-08-2019T03:55:33,Sclimshady,"Fair, I do a lot of PC work so I can watch at the same time"
23-08-2019T03:57:15,Dadrobit,"Alas, between work, school, voice over, and hobbies, art streams are super low on my priority list nowadays..."
23-08-2019T04:00:30,Sclimshady,"Personal stuff is definitely more important,  I also hate social interaction so my free time is spent at home as well.  I haven't done much except errands and school away from home"
23-08-2019T04:02:28,Sclimshady,"I need to go to sleep, see ya later o/"
23-08-2019T04:02:50,Dadrobit,"o/ have good sleeps, schlim."

23-08-2019T15:18:06,Kameloh,I'm still pretty stubborn about using layers though when it comes to paintings
23-08-2019T15:19:08,AnuSekaniArt,Ah I gotcha
23-08-2019T15:19:54,Phandril,it makes sense for rendering
23-08-2019T15:20:12,Sclimshady,My layers always look like they were put through a blender.  Stuff everywhere because I always forget to change
23-08-2019T15:21:03,PurpleLemons,Use the layers :cpurplelemons-Nut: it is a tool
23-08-2019T15:21:04,Phandril,and woe if you are on the wrong one and realize it too late!
23-08-2019T15:21:11,Kameloh,XD
23-08-2019T15:21:17,AnuSekaniArt,XD

23-08-2019T15:22:35,AnuSekaniArt,"I've been told to focus on traditional art for a while until I ""git gud"" and then go digital"
23-08-2019T15:22:53,Phandril,both traditional and digital have their charms!
23-08-2019T15:22:56,AnuSekaniArt,Was that bad advice? Lol
23-08-2019T15:23:05,Sclimshady,I try Purp :weary: I have just used traditional for like 10 years and always forget
23-08-2019T15:23:08,Kameloh,I think you can still get good with digital
23-08-2019T15:23:14,Kameloh,you'll build up dexterity with a tablet
23-08-2019T15:23:22,PurpleLemons,"Focus on fundamentals, how you do it is up to you"
23-08-2019T15:23:25,Kameloh,but traditional can be fun :snail:
23-08-2019T15:23:43,AnuSekaniArt,"So no matter what I do, focus on the small stuff first then?"
23-08-2019T15:23:56,PurpleLemons,Just draw a book full of perfect circles :cpurplelemons-tired:
23-08-2019T15:23:58,Kameloh,"yee, just draw a looooooot"
23-08-2019T15:24:18,Phandril,I think it depends on the person...you can get gud either way....but traditional is chaeper to start with...
23-08-2019T15:24:21,AnuSekaniArt,Now that my roommate moved out I plan to
23-08-2019T15:24:31,SageSaga,the main reason i recommend traditional first is to find out if you really want to be serious about making art as a hobby or Job
23-08-2019T15:24:40,Sclimshady,^
23-08-2019T15:25:03,Phandril,yee you don't want to waste money if you are not serious^^
23-08-2019T15:25:16,SageSaga,as much as i believe almost anyone is capable of drawing- the learning curve is different for everyone
23-08-2019T15:25:24,Sclimshady,"You can draw traditional with like 3 bucks of stuff,  digital is way more even for the cheap stuff"

23-08-2019T15:35:11,Sclimshady,Describe the link first
23-08-2019T15:35:11,SpazztasticKiwi,that gives me an idea for a sage emote - bongo cat smacking a rule book
23-08-2019T15:35:13,AnuSekaniArt,AS long as it's SFW and you describe what it is before linking it.
23-08-2019T15:35:34,IronHorseComics,"i just did but ok, it's just my first attempt at a face, all the way back nearly ten years ago"
23-08-2019T15:35:58,SageSaga,again you didnt read

23-08-2019T15:38:25,AnuSekaniArt,"No like, describe what the picture is and then link it."

23-08-2019T15:38:46,SageSaga,you asked if you could post it and said what it was
23-08-2019T15:38:57,SageSaga,then later you linked it with a description of where it was from!
23-08-2019T15:39:02,SageSaga,Thats not the same thing!
23-08-2019T15:39:16,Sclimshady,Look st my example
23-08-2019T15:39:18,SageSaga,The idea is to link the to together!

23-08-2019T15:40:21,SageSaga,(Description of thing) (Link to thing) - that way when i see a link pop up while im busy working- i dont just delete it because i can SEE What it is supposed to be

23-08-2019T15:41:09,SageSaga,if your description is (Something I found on Google) (Link) i should just ban you.
23-08-2019T15:41:15,SpazztasticKiwi,with that kind of face yeah don’t doubt it
23-08-2019T15:41:42,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ll point out that ^ is for sclim
23-08-2019T15:42:09,IronHorseComics,"now see Sage, I actually can't see the rules, I'm on Tom's page"
23-08-2019T15:42:28,SpazztasticKiwi,I got a little over 15 before work
23-08-2019T15:42:45,SpazztasticKiwi,so if I just drop off the earth that’s why

23-08-2019T15:49:01,Ordithus,"Yeah, Sage's work grew on me over time, too"
23-08-2019T15:49:02,PurpleLemons,Sage's comic is good :eyes:
23-08-2019T15:49:16,Ordithus,Honestly at first I wasn't really into Sage's style.  Dunno why.  But now <3
23-08-2019T15:49:17,AnuSekaniArt,It is ^^
23-08-2019T15:49:26,AnuSekaniArt,"Same Ord, same <3"

23-08-2019T15:49:39,Sclimshady,Yosh! *
23-08-2019T15:50:23,SageSaga,i recently increased the comic page size for Yosh! - it might have been a mistake- so much more work T_T
23-08-2019T15:50:40,SageSaga,3 of them a week now is tough
23-08-2019T15:51:20,PurpleLemons,Thats a lot
23-08-2019T15:51:39,Sclimshady,"I replaced the old Yosh tab and somehow that moved me back to Toms stream, weird"
23-08-2019T15:52:17,SageSaga,ive been doing 3 Yosh! comics and 1 AI comic every week for the past 3 years
23-08-2019T15:52:35,SageSaga,and before that it was 3 comics a week for the past 15 years
23-08-2019T15:53:34,Sclimshady,"Thats a lot of work, but man did your art improve fast"
23-08-2019T15:53:49,Ordithus,"Tom, if you"
23-08-2019T15:53:54,Ordithus,"'re there, nice comic!"
23-08-2019T15:54:42,Twokinds,Thanks
23-08-2019T15:54:52,SageSaga,Nibbly is clearly evil
23-08-2019T15:55:02,AnuSekaniArt,Hello Tom ^^
23-08-2019T15:55:45,vevans0009,Tom is here!
23-08-2019T15:56:00,Ordithus,She has merged with Sythe's ponytail.  The characters really pop in today's page
23-08-2019T15:56:06,FoxxTrotter,"E'lo, Tom."
23-08-2019T15:56:21,iliar,The smoke in the reflection of Nibs looks really suspicious.
23-08-2019T15:56:30,Sclimshady,"Oh gosh, I didn't even notice her"
23-08-2019T15:56:51,iliar,Although I do not think that Tom will make Nibs evil.
23-08-2019T15:56:58,Kameloh,:ckameloh-naokithinky:
23-08-2019T15:57:03,Sclimshady,Or will he...
23-08-2019T15:57:12,SageSaga,i wonder how many racist things i can have this elf girl say
23-08-2019T15:57:21,AnuSekaniArt,"Oh wow, didn't see that at first :O"
23-08-2019T15:57:28,Sclimshady,"lol,  a bunch probably"
23-08-2019T15:57:41,Ordithus,"""Do you get to the Elven district often?  Oh, what am I saying, of course you don't"""

23-08-2019T16:01:29,Phandril,bye Kiwi!
23-08-2019T16:01:43,AnuSekaniArt,Guess I'll share that pic now
23-08-2019T16:02:22,AnuSekaniArt,Here's a pic of my sona's head in anime style. Only my second time drawing stuff digitally. https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/393857693200154632/614714275717709857/AnuAnimeHeadSketch.png
23-08-2019T16:02:49,Kameloh,looks cool!
23-08-2019T16:03:01,Sclimshady,Nice!
23-08-2019T16:03:23,Phandril,:eyes: :ok_hand:
23-08-2019T16:04:09,AnuSekaniArt,Thanks ^^ Next time I'll try layers XD
23-08-2019T16:04:22,Sclimshady,They really do help
23-08-2019T16:05:50,SageSaga,"I dunno what to say about it because i know you are new to drawing ""Do i say it's nice for a start or do I point out where they need work? Usually new artists cant take criticism but saying its nice is misleading!"""
23-08-2019T16:06:15,Kameloh,encouragement to keep drawing :cat:
23-08-2019T16:06:15,AnuSekaniArt,XD
23-08-2019T16:06:20,AnuSekaniArt,I can take criticism
23-08-2019T16:06:35,AnuSekaniArt,"I know I'm new to drawing, I'll take any critique ^^"
23-08-2019T16:06:39,SageSaga,I dunno - They used to call me the Dream Crusher
23-08-2019T16:06:45,SageSaga,im joking
23-08-2019T16:06:47,Sclimshady,Metal
23-08-2019T16:06:48,Kameloh,XD
23-08-2019T16:06:50,SageSaga,<_<; mostly
23-08-2019T16:06:52,AnuSekaniArt,XD
23-08-2019T16:07:21,Kameloh,"for me, if they're new at art I just encourage them. when they get better and need a critique then I'll give them a critique"
23-08-2019T16:08:13,Sclimshady,"On the other hand, early criticism can avoid forming bad habits"
23-08-2019T16:08:18,SageSaga,yeah but im worried about people seeing their work and not really SEEING it- and when they show people who say it looks nice it affirms in their head that it's fine XD
23-08-2019T16:08:30,AnuSekaniArt,Yeah I understand that Sage XD
23-08-2019T16:08:43,AnuSekaniArt,"But like, I know my art's not good on a pure objective basis XD"
23-08-2019T16:09:12,Kameloh,yee! for me it's like... you have to learn the controls of the plane before you can teach them tricks XD
23-08-2019T16:09:30,Kameloh,"erm, they have to learn*"
23-08-2019T16:09:57,SageSaga,"i do recommend just drawing stuff for fun but if your goal is to be a good or great artist- if your focus is characters its all about proportions, anatomy, and action"
23-08-2019T16:10:02,Sclimshady,Firs one was accurate too
23-08-2019T16:10:40,Sclimshady,Action lines are a good thing to practice if you want good poses
23-08-2019T16:11:04,SageSaga,Gestural drawings are great for doing quick designs for poses
23-08-2019T16:11:20,SageSaga,and good for action- you use line of action to start a gestural
23-08-2019T16:11:43,Sclimshady,"I think that is what I meant, bad phrasing on my part"
23-08-2019T16:13:20,AnuSekaniArt,I gotcha ^^ Thanks guys ^^
23-08-2019T16:13:44,SageSaga,what program is that in?
23-08-2019T16:13:45,AnuSekaniArt,I do want to be a good or great artist but I know I'm a long way off XD So right now I'm just taking it one sketch at a time.
23-08-2019T16:13:51,AnuSekaniArt,Autodesk Sketchbook
23-08-2019T16:14:31,SageSaga,i used to use that for sketching practice
23-08-2019T16:14:52,SageSaga,it was really good for sketching- colors i think were ok but i liked the pencil look and feel
23-08-2019T16:15:41,SageSaga,i would stay away from coloring like you did there
23-08-2019T16:15:59,AnuSekaniArt,Yeah I figured as much XD
23-08-2019T16:16:10,SageSaga,focus on building up with Values (Black>White) and incorporate colors later
23-08-2019T16:16:34,AnuSekaniArt,Ah yeah that makes sense.
23-08-2019T16:16:43,AnuSekaniArt,Guess I jumped the gun a little lol
23-08-2019T16:17:17,Ordithus,"Keep practicing and experimenting, you'll find what works for you"
23-08-2019T16:17:39,Kameloh,:ckameloh-naokithinky:
23-08-2019T16:18:27,AnuSekaniArt,Thanks Ord ^^ Yeah that's my plan
23-08-2019T16:18:47,AnuSekaniArt,"I think what I""m going to do for now is focus on the basics: drawing objects as I see them in RL."
23-08-2019T16:21:36,Kynum,sup
23-08-2019T16:21:44,SageSaga,yo Kynum

23-08-2019T16:23:58,SageSaga,"im better with ""faces"" than Names- i used to have some friends on steam- but they changed their avatars on steam so often i stopped talking to them because i didnt know who they were anymore XD"
23-08-2019T16:24:12,Sclimshady,XD
23-08-2019T16:24:12,Ordithus,haha
23-08-2019T16:25:03,Kynum,"Yeah, I'm the same way when it comes to discord. People change their avatars and I'm like...""who're you?"""
23-08-2019T16:25:13,Kynum,luckily it's easy to check them out on discord.
23-08-2019T16:25:16,SageSaga,"occasionally i get a message from one or two of them ""Hey man how have ya been?"" And I either just ignore them or say ""Who are you and how did you get on my friends list?"""
23-08-2019T16:25:38,SageSaga,"or when i remember to- ""How dare you speak to me"""
23-08-2019T16:25:39,Kameloh,huh that's interesting!
23-08-2019T16:25:49,Kameloh,is that good for me 'cause I haven't changed my avatar in years
23-08-2019T16:25:53,Kameloh,other than the discord afro version
23-08-2019T16:26:03,AnuSekaniArt,I am the same way Sage XD
23-08-2019T16:26:20,Sclimshady,"lol, I am alright with game names because I need to for raids"
23-08-2019T16:26:35,SageSaga,one guy messaged me and i checked his name history to see if any rang a bell
23-08-2019T16:27:12,SageSaga,"his previous aliases were like ""1, 2, 3, 4, BUTTS, TITS, Jabookie"""
23-08-2019T16:27:21,Phandril,I'm going to get some :bread: Thanks for streaming!

23-08-2019T16:28:35,AnuSekaniArt,Oh my word Sage those are some...interesting names XD
23-08-2019T16:28:51,Ordithus,:csagesaga-nynastare: spinny thingy go away
23-08-2019T16:29:14,Sclimshady,But it loooves you
23-08-2019T16:31:32,SageSaga,so what kinda person names themselves a bunch of numbers but doesnt go far enough to erase the history of being once called Butts and or Tits?

23-08-2019T17:00:19,IronHorseComics,that actually reminds me of an animated short I kinda want to do
23-08-2019T17:01:02,IronHorseComics,"where a clown saves a kid from a scary clown using joy, humor, and cartoon slapstick"
23-08-2019T17:01:39,SageSaga,and then the clown eats the kid
23-08-2019T17:02:08,RheyareZeta,that build up
23-08-2019T17:02:28,IronHorseComics,"noooo, that would ruin the message: Stop demonizing clowns, please, all they want to do is make people laugh"
23-08-2019T17:02:53,Sclimshady,But they only give me nightmares
23-08-2019T17:03:21,SageSaga,if you wanna make people laugh- become a comedian

23-08-2019T19:59:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ll give Mark and Seán some credit - they’d likely not die too quick in a horror movie
23-08-2019T20:00:09,IronHorseComics,no but their girly screams would make great distractions
23-08-2019T20:00:16,SpazztasticKiwi,both of em upon the “better investigate that screaming”
23-08-2019T20:00:27,SpazztasticKiwi,“or we could call the police”
23-08-2019T20:02:09,SpazztasticKiwi,I can’t say I’ve managed to scream how they can
23-08-2019T20:02:52,IronHorseComics,"I used to, it was fake as all get out but I did manage the high pitch gravely scream for a little while"
23-08-2019T20:03:11,IronHorseComics,"but since I don't scream for a living, I forgot how to do it"
23-08-2019T20:04:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I can’t see Mark or Seán being so jumpy in life so I’d say you’d have to get them by surprise to get one
23-08-2019T20:16:28,SpazztasticKiwi,safe to say they’re both a bit cracked; too much youtube
23-08-2019T20:23:20,SpazztasticKiwi,back to werk I go ⛏

23-08-2019T22:28:50,AspiringNoodle,I accomplished 3 things today
23-08-2019T22:28:55,AspiringNoodle,1) I managed not to die
23-08-2019T22:29:03,AspiringNoodle,2) Updated the BIOS on my CPU to the latest version
23-08-2019T22:29:26,AspiringNoodle,3) Fixed a stupid setting that was enabled by default that made boot times 30+ seconds longer

23-08-2019T23:04:41,SpazztasticKiwi,the new saw is due 2020
23-08-2019T23:05:18,SpazztasticKiwi,and they’ve got Samuel Jackson & the Rock as involved
23-08-2019T23:05:45,SpazztasticKiwi,I want to know what made them drag those two into this
23-08-2019T23:06:56,SpazztasticKiwi,and why they’re referring to Chris Rock as “Rock”
23-08-2019T23:07:20,CrRAR,wut indeed
23-08-2019T23:07:36,CrRAR,There is only one true Rock
23-08-2019T23:08:10,CrRAR,and we perpetually wonder just exactly what he's cooking.
23-08-2019T23:08:12,SpazztasticKiwi,I love saw
23-08-2019T23:08:22,SpazztasticKiwi,but at what point do they let it die
23-08-2019T23:08:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"Jigsaw died in what, 4?"
23-08-2019T23:08:51,CrRAR,lol something like that
23-08-2019T23:09:09,CrRAR,But it's his LEGACY.
23-08-2019T23:09:31,SpazztasticKiwi,"same for Halloween, Krueger, and Voorheese"

23-08-2019T23:09:50,CrRAR,True
23-08-2019T23:10:33,CrRAR,It is quite a cast though.
23-08-2019T23:10:49,SpazztasticKiwi,"unless they’re gonna do a movie where they admit what rug they swept Jason’s dad under, I say chill with the reboots"
23-08-2019T23:11:15,SpazztasticKiwi,or they do one on his fight with Leatherface in the comics
23-08-2019T23:11:29,CrRAR,It's like they cancelled a filming of another Fast & Furious movie and just walked them on to a Saw film set.

23-08-2019T23:26:00,SpazztasticKiwi,considering Jason’s been drowned electrified and burned I don’t see him so much as giving a big long sigh over getting eaten alive
23-08-2019T23:26:04,SpazztasticKiwi,“alive”
23-08-2019T23:26:28,CrRAR,"Ehhh, more or less."

23-08-2019T23:27:18,SpazztasticKiwi,like in Freddy vs Jason someone has to give Jason CPR when he starts drowning in the dream Freddy puts him in
23-08-2019T23:27:39,SpazztasticKiwi,“why give him CPR he’s already dead” is a valid question
23-08-2019T23:30:01,CrRAR,He could probably just wake up of his own will anyway.
23-08-2019T23:30:26,CrRAR,...maybe... maybe he just wanted to know SOMEBODY cared enough.
23-08-2019T23:30:35,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-LauraCry:
23-08-2019T23:31:29,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s a pretty well shown concept that he doesn’t start swinging till swung at
23-08-2019T23:32:11,SpazztasticKiwi,lesson being: don’t attack the near 6 foot wall of an undead man with a machete and you’ll be fine
23-08-2019T23:33:17,CrRAR,tru
23-08-2019T23:33:33,SpazztasticKiwi,and you know part of his story is because he was born deformed he was constantly pushed around - whole reason his dad Elias isn’t in the picture is cause he was abusing him
23-08-2019T23:34:21,CrRAR,Yeah!
23-08-2019T23:34:26,SpazztasticKiwi,his mom caught Elias doing this and cut him up to protect him
23-08-2019T23:34:46,SpazztasticKiwi,comic wise anyway
23-08-2019T23:35:05,SpazztasticKiwi,in the movies he’s simply considered as whereabouts unknown
23-08-2019T23:35:13,CrRAR,"Was that established only in the Halloween in 2007, or was that part of the older lore?"
23-08-2019T23:35:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Jason is Friday the 13th not Halloween

23-08-2019T23:37:50,CrRAR,"Interesting though then, because that's similar to Halloween they portrayed him similarly."
23-08-2019T23:38:05,CrRAR,With the troubled childhood.
23-08-2019T23:38:25,CrRAR,Copycats I guess.
23-08-2019T23:38:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Leatherface isn’t much different
23-08-2019T23:39:30,SpazztasticKiwi,whole reason Jason and him become friends before their fight in the comics is because of abusive family
23-08-2019T23:39:56,SpazztasticKiwi,and again Jason doesn’t fight back until attacked directly
23-08-2019T23:43:46,CrRAR,Gotta be able to plead self defense in those court appearances. xD

23-08-2019T23:48:26,SpazztasticKiwi,granted his mental development was stunted and even without that he wasn’t given much encouragement when anyone other than his mom heard him
