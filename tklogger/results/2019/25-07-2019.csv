25-07-2019T00:00:08,AspiringNoodle,"Nope, but I did see a video mention him being in a game :P"
25-07-2019T00:00:37,Sclimshady,He posted 1.5 hours of him trying to unlock his character
25-07-2019T00:04:24,AspiringNoodle,Haha
25-07-2019T00:04:26,AspiringNoodle,He said it
25-07-2019T00:07:40,Sclimshady,Said what? I lost the flow of conversation
25-07-2019T00:09:23,AspiringNoodle,"""I'm not gonna eat ass-"" *proceeds to flip out to what he said*"
25-07-2019T00:11:59,Sclimshady,Ah
25-07-2019T00:12:07,SomeNiceUser,That was something.
25-07-2019T00:12:11,AspiringNoodle,Me: *lights dynamite to blow up raft*
25-07-2019T00:12:15,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-snicker:
25-07-2019T00:12:42,SomeNiceUser,The rest of the ship: :ptv-kippi3:
25-07-2019T00:12:52,Sclimshady,I wouldn't put thaT past lann
25-07-2019T00:13:53,AspiringNoodle,"""YOU get eaten by a shark. YOU get eaten by a shark! I get eaten by a shark! WE ALL GET EATEN BY A SHARK!"" :ptv-hearts:"
25-07-2019T00:16:31,AspiringNoodle,"At this point I'm sticking around until a shark shows up, lol"
25-07-2019T00:17:00,Sclimshady,It WILL kill them all
25-07-2019T00:18:29,SomeNiceUser,A shark will appear when you least expect it...
25-07-2019T00:18:29,AspiringNoodle,How do you know? :P
25-07-2019T00:18:53,AspiringNoodle,Love the floating turtle shells
25-07-2019T00:19:36,AspiringNoodle,"Anyone ever see that b-list horror film with a literal ""You die in the game you die in real life"" plot?"
25-07-2019T00:19:52,SomeNiceUser,Nah.
25-07-2019T00:20:44,AspiringNoodle,"It was pretty cool, in concept"
25-07-2019T00:20:57,AspiringNoodle,"It had the stereotypical cheesy ""game footage"" segments"
25-07-2019T00:21:36,AspiringNoodle,"You know, the ones where they animate gameplay for the sake of a movie, and you KNOW it's not a real game :P"
25-07-2019T00:23:08,AspiringNoodle,The idea was the game was based around an old mansion in the area it showed up in
25-07-2019T00:23:39,AspiringNoodle,"You played the game, trying to solve the mystery of what happened there, and if your avatar died in the game, some time later a spirit would find and kill you in a gruesome manner"
25-07-2019T00:23:51,AspiringNoodle,"And you couldn't just stop playing the game, because eventually it would keep playing without you."
25-07-2019T00:24:47,AspiringNoodle,And the most interesting part is that you could have a person in the real world affect the game world and vice-versa
25-07-2019T00:24:50,SomeNiceUser,That is a interesting concept.
25-07-2019T00:25:51,AspiringNoodle,"A good example would be when one of the people got trapped in an attic room by 3 spirits, and one of the other people played the game and had their avatar find their friend"
25-07-2019T00:26:11,AspiringNoodle,They used a rose from their inventory and momentarily repel the ghosts to let their friend escape
25-07-2019T00:26:59,AspiringNoodle,"Quality wise, it's your typical syfy channel original movie schlock, but the concept was so interesting"
25-07-2019T00:27:38,AspiringNoodle,I feel like I missed something
25-07-2019T00:29:44,SomeNiceUser,"The day where VR takes THE step of full immersion, that would the day where new places of interest would be built."
25-07-2019T00:32:02,AspiringNoodle,"Well, I saw a shark. I saw them kill a shark.  I'm satisfied :)"
25-07-2019T00:36:22,SomeNiceUser,"Since they killed a shark, now I must recharge."
25-07-2019T00:36:47,AspiringNoodle,I'm happy that I finally settled on what I'm gonna do with my computer build
25-07-2019T00:36:53,AspiringNoodle,Biggest headache over <3
25-07-2019T00:37:25,SomeNiceUser,That’s great! At least you got yourself a PC coming!
25-07-2019T00:37:59,AspiringNoodle,"Yeah, unless you're willing to spend a lot of extra money and deal with some headaches, trying to coordinate fans is gonna be a nightmare >_>"
25-07-2019T00:39:24,SomeNiceUser,"I should get myself a portable, I kinda am a person who doesn’t have a desk anymore."
25-07-2019T00:39:47,AspiringNoodle,"I might do that someday, should I find myself travelling enough.  Even then, might get back into handhelds ;)"
25-07-2019T00:39:48,SomeNiceUser,As in I don’t have the space for that.
25-07-2019T00:40:42,AspiringNoodle,The reason I chose the case that I did is twofold
25-07-2019T00:40:42,SomeNiceUser,A good 2k$ should get me somewhere.
25-07-2019T00:40:48,AspiringNoodle,"Oh, definitely"
25-07-2019T00:41:07,SomeNiceUser,Any suggestions?
25-07-2019T00:41:31,AspiringNoodle,For starters: https://www.newegg.com/iron-grey-cooler-master-mastercase-h500m-atx-mid-tower/p/N82E16811119349?Item=N82E16811119349
25-07-2019T00:41:38,AspiringNoodle,"Holy f*cking air flow, Batman!"
25-07-2019T00:42:00,AspiringNoodle,"And if you're talking about laptops, I believe Acer has some good gaming ones"
25-07-2019T00:44:16,SomeNiceUser,"A AMD rysen core is very cost friendly compared to intel, and better."
25-07-2019T00:44:51,AspiringNoodle,"If you plan to get a gaming laptop, get something like this: https://www.newegg.com/p/1TS-000X-00R00?Description=acer&cm_re=acer-_-1TS-000X-00R00-_-Product"
25-07-2019T00:45:10,AspiringNoodle,The bulkier laptops will have the more robust cooling solutions
25-07-2019T00:45:34,SpazztasticKiwi,well that was a special ball of organized chaos
25-07-2019T00:45:37,AspiringNoodle,"If it looks like an apple laptop, yeet that shit straight into the sun"
25-07-2019T00:46:09,SpazztasticKiwi,sclim was anyone else in that mob live
25-07-2019T00:47:24,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
25-07-2019T00:48:58,SomeNiceUser,"That’s a good recommendation Noodle. Now I must allow my fragile body rest, I cannot make such decisions in this state."
25-07-2019T00:49:05,SomeNiceUser,:ptv-sleepy:
25-07-2019T00:51:27,AspiringNoodle,I think I shall join them

25-07-2019T02:05:35,Bgrmystr2,so the feeling's mutual.
25-07-2019T02:05:39,Bgrmystr2,don't mind it. :)

25-07-2019T16:25:42,IronHorseComics,for a night of pure madness
25-07-2019T16:25:45,SpazztasticKiwi,I saw a truck with a spare horseshoe hanging off it
25-07-2019T16:26:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I guess it was in case a tire popped he’d break out the horse
25-07-2019T16:26:12,Bgrmystr2,"""Decided to join us"" you remember that I live here xD"
25-07-2019T16:26:14,Bgrmystr2,I'm always here.
25-07-2019T16:31:02,SpazztasticKiwi,The bathrooms at the park have assistants now do you want to see him

25-07-2019T16:34:21,SpazztasticKiwi,and hi Tom
25-07-2019T16:34:26,Bgrmystr2,but I guess my opinion is both late and irrelevant
25-07-2019T16:34:40,SpazztasticKiwi,too late responding just don’t look
25-07-2019T16:34:43,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock: THAT IS NOT AN ASSISTANT
25-07-2019T16:34:54,IronHorseComics,"sure he is, he's keeping the roaches out"
25-07-2019T16:35:00,IronHorseComics,he's your security
25-07-2019T16:35:05,Bgrmystr2,Keeps half of the humans out too
25-07-2019T16:35:08,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s a she actually if it’s that big
25-07-2019T16:35:19,SpazztasticKiwi,the males usually don’t get big at all
25-07-2019T16:35:35,SpazztasticKiwi,at least she was in the ladies room
25-07-2019T16:35:58,Bgrmystr2,":ptv-wondering: A spider with manners, who'da thunk it."
25-07-2019T16:36:35,SpazztasticKiwi,just think of the panic of a man went to his designated restroom and found a lady like that
25-07-2019T16:36:41,SpazztasticKiwi,he’d be shooketh
25-07-2019T16:37:30,SpazztasticKiwi,she was pretty chill - didn’t want to get off the paper when o was trying to toss her in the tree line
25-07-2019T16:38:11,IronHorseComics,*looks at the current...climate* yeah... shooketh
25-07-2019T16:40:28,SpazztasticKiwi,“I don’t need to go that bad”
25-07-2019T16:41:24,IronHorseComics,"well, she's just there to eat the roaches and other pests, don't bug her and she won't bother you"
25-07-2019T16:41:59,SpazztasticKiwi,this is true but some people very much will see a spider and decide it’s time to move
25-07-2019T16:42:09,SpazztasticKiwi,others are the same with snakes
25-07-2019T16:42:44,SpazztasticKiwi,I know Mark said a snake came on set during their filming in Austin and while he noped out everyone else was like “oo snek”
25-07-2019T16:43:10,IronHorseComics,I remember one day opening up my shower curtain one day and found a skink of all things in my shower
25-07-2019T16:43:30,IronHorseComics,I got him outside but it was not something I was expecting
25-07-2019T16:44:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera’s caught a lizard as it’s wondered inside when the door was cracked
25-07-2019T16:45:07,SpazztasticKiwi,you can imagine that poor things thoughts
25-07-2019T16:45:37,IronHorseComics,"""Oh noes, this cat's gonna eat me!"""
25-07-2019T16:46:07,SpazztasticKiwi,my sister got it away from him and threw him back out the door

25-07-2019T18:37:59,AspiringNoodle,"Dangit, did it again"
25-07-2019T18:38:29,SpazztasticKiwi,his family was visiting the zoo from America when she was giving tours and they happened to meet gazes
25-07-2019T18:39:15,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s cute but at the same time I’m sitting here like
25-07-2019T18:39:32,SpazztasticKiwi,“ok if it’s that common why am I still waiting”
25-07-2019T18:40:38,CrRAR,gotta gaze the right gaze I guess.

25-07-2019T19:01:20,AspiringNoodle,Here's a good question
25-07-2019T19:01:29,SpazztasticKiwi,that same guy is currently crafting a Saron

25-07-2019T19:01:52,AspiringNoodle,World's worst paper cut?
25-07-2019T19:01:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Sauron

25-07-2019T19:10:43,IronHorseComics,or maybe he's just borrowing the car

25-07-2019T19:32:07,TeapotOfDoom,You ever saw james veitch's video aboat floating ducks
25-07-2019T19:32:15,TeapotOfDoom,It's hillarious
25-07-2019T19:32:17,SpazztasticKiwi,frogs are basically just mouths with enough leg to project said mouth to food
25-07-2019T19:32:34,CrRAR,A mobile mouth
25-07-2019T19:32:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I know my frog gives some nightmares
25-07-2019T19:32:36,Bgrmystr2,the goddamn ducks
25-07-2019T19:32:40,Bgrmystr2,are the best
25-07-2019T19:32:48,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ll admit frogs don’t need teeth but here we are
25-07-2019T19:32:53,TeapotOfDoom,I guess that was the project desciption when they were created
25-07-2019T19:33:22,SpazztasticKiwi,when you see an animal with too many accessories: is that necessary
25-07-2019T19:33:28,TeapotOfDoom,Pretty acurate
25-07-2019T19:33:57,CrRAR,Does a platapus fall into that category?
25-07-2019T19:34:24,SpazztasticKiwi,provided they’re poisonous
25-07-2019T19:34:26,SpazztasticKiwi,? Yes

25-07-2019T19:37:20,SpazztasticKiwi,I swear one of the few times I’ve laughed hard enough to wheeze was when Mark showed that video
25-07-2019T19:37:46,SpazztasticKiwi,now he references it now and then in a blue moon and I
25-07-2019T19:37:59,SomeNiceUser,The video is pretty funny after all.
25-07-2019T19:38:00,Bgrmystr2,Now if only people could properly remember the terms :V
25-07-2019T19:38:26,SpazztasticKiwi,the whole point is the insanity of how you stream how the word

25-07-2019T20:04:37,TeapotOfDoom,:ctwokinds-FloDance:
25-07-2019T20:05:03,SpazztasticKiwi,that was a very nice blank canvas Sage
25-07-2019T20:05:11,TeapotOfDoom,Well i sure didn't see a thing. Did you?
25-07-2019T20:05:38,FloofyCat,"That's a very good reference sheet for Sage's new character, A4 sheet of paper."
25-07-2019T20:05:50,TeapotOfDoom,Damn picarto app. Keeps dying
25-07-2019T20:06:01,SageSaga,this is not A4 size
25-07-2019T20:06:08,NextGenAnubisKid,I have to use my browser. Picarto on Android straight up just doesn't work XD
25-07-2019T20:06:27,FloofyCat,Well I'd imagine it's much bigger but its roughly A4 shaped
25-07-2019T20:06:32,TeapotOfDoom,Can confirm. If the chat becomas to long the app stalls
25-07-2019T20:06:48,SageSaga,nah its actually much smaller
25-07-2019T20:07:05,SageSaga,this is 72DPI
25-07-2019T20:07:43,Ordithus,Your colored work is way higher res though
25-07-2019T20:07:50,IronHorseComics,*screams*
25-07-2019T20:08:08,SageSaga,yeah after i sketch at 72dpi i scale up to 300 to ink and color
25-07-2019T20:08:38,Ordithus,Why do you sketch at such a low resolution?
25-07-2019T20:08:44,Tharkis,:ctharkis-earwiggle:
25-07-2019T20:08:49,Ordithus,ello Tharkis!
25-07-2019T20:08:52,SageSaga,because 72DPI is the standard Web Resolution
25-07-2019T20:08:56,BadFoMo,Yo.
25-07-2019T20:09:02,SageSaga,and these images are never going to be printed
25-07-2019T20:09:21,NextGenAnubisKid,Oh interesting ^^
25-07-2019T20:09:47,Ordithus,"So, ""good enough"" for the job"
25-07-2019T20:09:56,PurpleLemons,heya o/
25-07-2019T20:10:02,Ordithus,Hi Purp
25-07-2019T20:10:05,NextGenAnubisKid,Will keep that in mind. Getting into y'all's comics has given me motivation to try art again ^^
25-07-2019T20:10:07,SageSaga,yeah- i got used to doing it this way from working on lower end hardware
25-07-2019T20:10:09,TeapotOfDoom,Hoi purp
25-07-2019T20:10:09,NextGenAnubisKid,Hello Purple!
25-07-2019T20:10:11,IronHorseComics,"I can't stand low res images believe it or not, I never draw below 150 dpi. But then again, that's because I work at a print shop and see them so often and they ALWAYS look terrible that I've grown to despise them"
25-07-2019T20:10:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Sage you know if Toms got a thing for being tweeted
25-07-2019T20:10:33,SageSaga,my current system could easily do 600DPI+ for anything- but its not necessary
25-07-2019T20:10:38,FloofyCat,"I always set it to 300dpi, easier to scale down and such and not lose too much quality."
25-07-2019T20:10:46,FloofyCat,Waifu2x exists anyway
25-07-2019T20:10:53,IronHorseComics,300 is the minimum for printing
25-07-2019T20:11:07,SageSaga,yep which is why all my printed stuff is 300
25-07-2019T20:11:20,SageSaga,more than 300 for most printing is also a waste
25-07-2019T20:11:36,Zakuru,evening dudes
25-07-2019T20:11:38,SageSaga,Kiwi - not sure what you are asking
25-07-2019T20:11:46,IronHorseComics,to be fair it's great for tiny details going super obnoxiously high
25-07-2019T20:11:54,SpazztasticKiwi,he doesn’t like @ here
25-07-2019T20:11:55,FloofyCat,3000 dpi if your RAM is a masochist
25-07-2019T20:11:58,Ordithus,Hi Zak
25-07-2019T20:12:00,SpazztasticKiwi,what bout twitter
25-07-2019T20:12:07,TeapotOfDoom,I still wonder who came up with that name
25-07-2019T20:12:09,Zakuru,hi ordithus :3
25-07-2019T20:12:36,FloofyCat,6000 dpi and Photoshop will start to rival Google Chrome on RAM usage lul
25-07-2019T20:12:45,IronHorseComics,I have to trace so many logos because people rip them from the internet it's not funny
25-07-2019T20:12:47,SageSaga,i dont know his opinion on being @ed on twitter- i just do it if it concerns him or is for him- i know he has whispers off here
25-07-2019T20:13:24,FloofyCat,Why is it too warm everywhere? :(
25-07-2019T20:13:52,IronHorseComics,"it's late July, it's always super hot this time of year on the northern side of the equator"
25-07-2019T20:13:57,Ordithus,"Not too hot here.  Pretty nice, really"
25-07-2019T20:14:16,IronHorseComics,"it actually has been uncharacteristically cool this week, last week was awful"
25-07-2019T20:14:24,FloofyCat,There was just the heat wave but it kinda won't cool down.
25-07-2019T20:14:33,CrRAR,"cool nights, warm days~"
25-07-2019T20:14:47,FloofyCat,over 100 degrees in the UK isn't really good
25-07-2019T20:14:50,SageSaga,if the logo res isnt that bad you could just use a new AI upscale program- those are pretty good
25-07-2019T20:14:55,CrRAR,don't sound good
25-07-2019T20:15:04,kittyelfie,hi
25-07-2019T20:15:07,CrRAR,hi
25-07-2019T20:15:20,IronHorseComics,"not really, I've done them a bunch and very rarely do they look decent"
25-07-2019T20:15:32,FloofyCat,Waifu2x is good for upscaling if your logo doesn't have some sort of real life image in it and such
25-07-2019T20:15:47,IronHorseComics,"wait no, I'm thinking of the auto-trace"
25-07-2019T20:15:49,SageSaga,i would demonstrate the new Clipstudio one- but i havent updated yet XD
25-07-2019T20:15:49,IronHorseComics,my bad
25-07-2019T20:16:32,SageSaga,ah you were thinking like Illustrater's auto inking?
25-07-2019T20:16:37,IronHorseComics,yep
25-07-2019T20:16:37,TeapotOfDoom,Waifu2x is insane
25-07-2019T20:16:42,IronHorseComics,the corel one too
25-07-2019T20:16:56,IronHorseComics,my OTHER job uses Corel Draw X5 (Kill me)
25-07-2019T20:18:11,FloofyCat,Waifu2x is downright amazing. You can give a .jpg lossy PTSD and Waifu2x will make it look decent again.
25-07-2019T20:18:34,TeapotOfDoom,Just out of curiosity: has anybody here heard about krita? It's a painting program and is open source. I had to install it on a bunch of systems today for a workshop
25-07-2019T20:18:45,IronHorseComics,I just resort to manually tracing logos
25-07-2019T20:19:01,IronHorseComics,made me learn a lot about Illustrator
25-07-2019T20:19:21,SageSaga,you should give something like Waifu2x a shot then and see if it saves ya a bunch of time :P
25-07-2019T20:19:59,IronHorseComics,"eh, maybe on my own time. I actually don't mind manually tracing logos"
25-07-2019T20:20:00,SageSaga,takes less than a minute- might as well try it before spending 10 minutes to 2 hours redrawing someones logo
25-07-2019T20:20:24,FloofyCat,"Just upload a file, wait 30 seconds, there's multiple versions available online."
25-07-2019T20:20:30,IronHorseComics,beats having to retype forms and invoices
25-07-2019T20:21:30,IronHorseComics,"word of advise, when using microsoft word, MAKE SURE YOU EXPORT TO PDF BEFORE TAKING IT TO A PRINT SHOP"
25-07-2019T20:21:34,AspiringNoodle,Most people will notice the difference between 30 and 60
25-07-2019T20:21:41,AspiringNoodle,Less between 60 and 120
25-07-2019T20:21:47,AspiringNoodle,Even less between 120 and 240
25-07-2019T20:22:04,AspiringNoodle,"That said, I've experienced gameplay at 30 fps, I've experienced it at 144.  144 is so silky smooth ;_;"
25-07-2019T20:22:21,AspiringNoodle,"Bleh, that's 2 missed whispers"
25-07-2019T20:22:22,AspiringNoodle,RIP
25-07-2019T20:22:23,IronHorseComics,"because the moment you bring a word document into the mac version, it will not export correctly, it works differently for mac than PC"

25-07-2019T20:22:28,Bgrmystr2,rip
25-07-2019T20:22:44,SageSaga,why are you suddenly talking about FPS?
25-07-2019T20:22:58,AspiringNoodle,Me and BGR having a nice conversation about refresh rate atm :P
25-07-2019T20:23:07,SageSaga,dont you lie to me
25-07-2019T20:23:09,Bgrmystr2,"""Missed whisper"" Kinda clues that in?"
25-07-2019T20:23:14,SageSaga,no one has a nice conversation with BGR
25-07-2019T20:23:19,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-karenOOO:
25-07-2019T20:23:30,Bgrmystr2,Yeah I know. It's like people hate me for some reason.
25-07-2019T20:23:45,AspiringNoodle,Maybe because you're super dismissive? xD
25-07-2019T20:23:46,SageSaga,you know why you cur
25-07-2019T20:23:52,CrRAR,lol
25-07-2019T20:24:11,IronHorseComics,oh and learn the difference between margins and bleeds *rant mode*
25-07-2019T20:24:26,AspiringNoodle,"Oh damn, it's turning into a warzone out here"
25-07-2019T20:24:27,SageSaga,i dunno why cur was the first not really serious insult that came to mind but there ya have it
25-07-2019T20:24:41,Bgrmystr2,"It's at least new, I'll give ya that."
25-07-2019T20:25:06,CrRAR,It's an insult straight from the HEART
25-07-2019T20:25:10,CrRAR,:two_hearts:
25-07-2019T20:25:29,Bgrmystr2,xD
25-07-2019T20:26:45,SageSaga,i hadnt read the part about the missed whisper because i was catching up on chat- we streamers gotta do that sometimes
25-07-2019T20:27:37,Bgrmystr2,Well now you know.. and knowing is half the battle.. gocobrawhatever
25-07-2019T20:28:22,SageSaga,this is how you know Bgr is evil- he just said Cobra instead of the GI JOES- hes a villain
25-07-2019T20:28:52,Bgrmystr2,You die a hero.. or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.
25-07-2019T20:29:23,SageSaga,are you saying you've lived too long?
25-07-2019T20:29:41,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: hmm no. Just thinking to myself
25-07-2019T20:30:18,SageSaga,you are bad at that :csagesaga-nynastare:
25-07-2019T20:30:23,IronHorseComics,we're all villains... 'cept for me of course
25-07-2019T20:30:31,Ordithus,"Bgr, I can read your thoughts"
25-07-2019T20:30:38,Bgrmystr2,"THanks, Sage. I try reallly hard."
25-07-2019T20:31:01,CrRAR,Are they delicious ord?
25-07-2019T20:31:13,SomeNiceUser,":ptv-condescending: we are all villains, under the mighty Maeve."
25-07-2019T20:31:28,Bgrmystr2,Btw sage do you have the theme for Cop Craft in your playlist? It's really Cowboy Bebob-esque
25-07-2019T20:31:48,Bgrmystr2,"I enjoyed it, figured it might fit in."
25-07-2019T20:31:52,CrRAR,very cute and sexy and :ptv-ohmy: so far sage
25-07-2019T20:32:04,SageSaga,I havent watched Cop Craft yet- its in my to watch list though- i think its on Hulu?
25-07-2019T20:32:45,Bgrmystr2,"I've been watching it, it's like Bebob but instead of gun detective + Sci fi.. it's gun detective + fantasy"
25-07-2019T20:32:50,Bgrmystr2,it's super interesting
25-07-2019T20:33:37,Bgrmystr2,though I guess it's kinda sci fi a little..? It's a good mixture
25-07-2019T20:34:22,NextGenAnubisKid,"Yeeee Sage, this is coming along nicely :D"
25-07-2019T20:34:56,SomeNiceUser,Sci-fi plus fantasy is an interesting combination for a story.
25-07-2019T20:35:24,NextGenAnubisKid,Yeah Science Fantasy is a really neat and underdone genre
25-07-2019T20:35:33,NextGenAnubisKid,Tis actually why I got into Shadowrun
25-07-2019T20:36:01,NextGenAnubisKid,Since that's just Cyberpunk Science Fantasy lol
25-07-2019T20:36:08,SomeNiceUser,I think I’m going to make one as a webcomic. Probably.
25-07-2019T20:37:08,NextGenAnubisKid,Would be neat ^^
25-07-2019T20:37:13,CrRAR,got me some mini wheats
25-07-2019T20:37:25,SageSaga,<_< Yosh! is Scifi/Fantasy
25-07-2019T20:37:37,SomeNiceUser,"Yes, the whole wheat mini wheats..."
25-07-2019T20:37:47,IronHorseComics,for a moment I thought you said Yoshi is Scifi/Fantasy
25-07-2019T20:38:15,SageSaga,that's scary- for a moment you couldnt read!
25-07-2019T20:38:46,IronHorseComics,"no that's normal, I suck at proofreading"
25-07-2019T20:38:50,SageSaga,:P sorry i hear that way too often
25-07-2019T20:39:23,SomeNiceUser,I hear Kazoo yoshi playing in the back of my mind
25-07-2019T20:39:23,SageSaga,"""This is Sage and he does the comic Yoshi!"""
25-07-2019T20:39:42,TeapotOfDoom,Yoshi!
25-07-2019T20:39:54,SageSaga,*Neck creaks towards introducer* Excuse me?
25-07-2019T20:40:57,SpazztasticKiwi,puns misspellings and mispronunciations
25-07-2019T20:41:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Sage is an English teacher
25-07-2019T20:41:15,SageSaga,uh
25-07-2019T20:41:16,SageSaga,no
25-07-2019T20:41:29,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-power:
25-07-2019T20:41:40,SageSaga,if i were I wouldnt keep on mixing up my their/there/the're 's
25-07-2019T20:41:42,SomeNiceUser,May I post a YouTube link?
25-07-2019T20:41:50,SpazztasticKiwi,isn’t there a food named yoshi
25-07-2019T20:42:16,SageSaga,you may only post links that are SFW and you must say what the link is to/about before the link
25-07-2019T20:42:51,SageSaga,if you lie - then you get banned
25-07-2019T20:43:13,TeapotOfDoom,:hammer: :ctwokinds-sleepoverB:
25-07-2019T20:43:17,SageSaga,"for example ""This is my personal website that i made all by myself! google.com"" you are banned"
25-07-2019T20:43:31,SpazztasticKiwi,i was close - yoshi is a restaurant
25-07-2019T20:43:41,Tharkis,but
25-07-2019T20:43:45,Tharkis,what if the person is Larry Page?
25-07-2019T20:43:54,Tharkis,:ctharkis-uneasy:
25-07-2019T20:43:54,TeapotOfDoom,Prove it
25-07-2019T20:43:56,Ordithus,Banned anyways
25-07-2019T20:43:57,IronHorseComics,"hmmm, what classify's as SFW though? I'm sure the usual nudes, blood and gore, and other gross things falls under NSFW..."
25-07-2019T20:44:00,SpazztasticKiwi,*sad trombone*
25-07-2019T20:44:04,IronHorseComics,but what of bikinis?
25-07-2019T20:44:09,SomeNiceUser,It’s a vid about a kazoo cover of flower garden from Super mario bros 2
25-07-2019T20:44:17,ZRO4825,Toyoko looks great in bikinis.
25-07-2019T20:44:21,ZRO4825,OwO
25-07-2019T20:44:21,BadFoMo,@Tharkis That's what I was about to ask.
25-07-2019T20:44:35,SpazztasticKiwi,if it’s a “bikini” you can’t go out in public in keep it at home
25-07-2019T20:44:40,SageSaga,the example was me saying that
25-07-2019T20:44:54,SageSaga,clearly I am not Larry
25-07-2019T20:45:05,ZRO4825,"Also, sup folks! ^^/"
25-07-2019T20:45:07,SomeNiceUser,I meant super Mario world 2
25-07-2019T20:45:15,Ordithus,Hi ZRO
25-07-2019T20:45:30,SomeNiceUser,Can I send you the link sage.
25-07-2019T20:45:38,SomeNiceUser,?
25-07-2019T20:45:43,ZRO4825,"Also, awww, cheetah girl. We don't see much of her."
25-07-2019T20:45:45,BadFoMo,@SageSaga  You would ban yourself if you said that?
25-07-2019T20:45:50,ZRO4825,I think she's cheetah based...
25-07-2019T20:45:56,ZRO4825,I've never thought about it much before...
25-07-2019T20:46:40,SageSaga,I cant watch youtube videos while streaming
25-07-2019T20:46:49,SageSaga,the audio would go over my stream
25-07-2019T20:46:54,SomeNiceUser,Oh. Lol
25-07-2019T20:47:09,SageSaga,also Zro
25-07-2019T20:47:12,SageSaga,not a cheetah
25-07-2019T20:47:18,ZRO4825,Ocelot?
25-07-2019T20:47:23,SageSaga,yes
25-07-2019T20:47:33,TeapotOfDoom,I'm gonna call it a day folks. Night y'all
25-07-2019T20:47:36,ZRO4825,"Bah. Went with first instinct, should've second guessed myself for once, lmao"
25-07-2019T20:47:37,SomeNiceUser,I’m not sure to post this even if it’s sfw...
25-07-2019T20:47:39,Ordithus,"Been a while since I've seen her, I couldn't really remember her!"
25-07-2019T20:47:41,TeapotOfDoom,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
25-07-2019T20:47:43,ZRO4825,Have a g'night Teapot~
25-07-2019T20:47:43,Ordithus,Night Tea
25-07-2019T20:47:45,SageSaga,or more Lynx
25-07-2019T20:48:00,ZRO4825,"Eh, Lynxes typically aren't really spotty."
25-07-2019T20:48:01,SomeNiceUser,night tea!
25-07-2019T20:48:06,SageSaga,sure they are
25-07-2019T20:48:23,IronHorseComics,clearly she's a leopard
25-07-2019T20:48:30,SageSaga,shes not a leopard
25-07-2019T20:48:36,ZRO4825,"Nope. Definitely not leopard. Those are spots, not rosettes."
25-07-2019T20:49:04,SageSaga,there are totally spotted Lynxes though
25-07-2019T20:49:23,ZRO4825,"Oh I'm not arguing that, for sure. There's a damned lot of cats out there, after all, lol."
25-07-2019T20:49:40,ZRO4825,"I'm just saying typicaly when you say Lynx, one does not envision spots. ^_^"
25-07-2019T20:49:45,ZRO4825,typically*
25-07-2019T20:50:16,SageSaga,I do
25-07-2019T20:50:21,SomeNiceUser,I really should check out your comic sometime Sage.
25-07-2019T20:50:22,Ordithus,Kitty! :ptv-excited:
25-07-2019T20:50:28,SageSaga,screw your personal vision of Lynxes
25-07-2019T20:50:40,ZRO4825,"Well you're weird, Sage. :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:"
25-07-2019T20:50:59,ZRO4825,Just like everyone else born on your birthday!
25-07-2019T20:51:01,SageSaga,maybe you are the weird one
25-07-2019T20:51:06,SageSaga,http://artificialincident.com
25-07-2019T20:51:06,Ordithus,@SomeNiceUser Sage has two comics!  Yosh! and Artificial Incident.  AI is newer and shorter at this point.
25-07-2019T20:51:22,SageSaga,AI is the one i recommend to read
25-07-2019T20:51:35,Ordithus,:csagesaga-nynasmirk: Nyna is from AI
25-07-2019T20:51:37,ZRO4825,It has elves and catgirls and wolfgirls.
25-07-2019T20:51:40,SageSaga,Yosh! is if you for some reason want to put yourself through over 2000 comics
25-07-2019T20:51:44,ZRO4825,And some humans too.
25-07-2019T20:51:52,ZRO4825,I think we're over 2250 now...or at least close
25-07-2019T20:51:59,SageSaga,2239
25-07-2019T20:52:10,ZRO4825,"Yup, damnit. So close."
25-07-2019T20:52:10,NextGenAnubisKid,Yikes that's a lotta webcomic XD
25-07-2019T20:52:19,Ordithus,"The start of Yosh is a struggle, gotta admit.  But it picks up and is a fun ride"
25-07-2019T20:52:28,ZRO4825,"To be fair you can avoid the first like...500, and still be pretty on top of things, iirc."
25-07-2019T20:52:45,SageSaga,yep - Yosh started as a forum webcomic - where i just drew silly things for friends on a forum
25-07-2019T20:52:56,IronHorseComics,and then it exploded
25-07-2019T20:52:59,SageSaga,and was me getting used to drawing in a comic format more
25-07-2019T20:53:03,Ordithus,I did not know that
25-07-2019T20:53:15,SageSaga,and then i got a cowriter to help me organize things
25-07-2019T20:53:31,PurpleLemons,she's a qt :eyes:
25-07-2019T20:53:32,NextGenAnubisKid,"I'd like to start a webcomic of my own, but I am literally starting from scratch when it comes to artistic skills XD"
25-07-2019T20:53:33,ZRO4825,"I didn't know for sure, but I had my suspicions with how the start of it was. It kinda read at first like a gag-a-day type of thing, but gets so much better <3"
25-07-2019T20:53:33,SageSaga,and then it exploded into plots and gags
25-07-2019T20:53:44,SomeNiceUser,"I already like it so far, saved just in time before my device dies."
25-07-2019T20:53:48,ZRO4825,"And no, that's not just me sucking up to the author."
25-07-2019T20:54:03,SomeNiceUser,2%
25-07-2019T20:54:25,Ordithus,"Plots, gags, and cute girls"
25-07-2019T20:54:34,ZRO4825,And hot androids!

25-07-2019T20:54:45,SomeNiceUser,:ptv-ohmy:
25-07-2019T20:54:53,Ordithus,And the occasional Phil in a maid outfit
25-07-2019T20:55:04,ZRO4825,"Yup, there's some of that too...poor Phil."
25-07-2019T20:55:19,SomeNiceUser,Gotta have that guy who’s cross dressing.
25-07-2019T20:55:28,Ordithus,He did it for love~
25-07-2019T20:55:34,ZRO4825,Iz truth.
25-07-2019T20:56:03,SageSaga,ok - i gotta share that- it has one of my favorite lines in the comic

25-07-2019T21:00:05,SomeNiceUser,I now looked up your stream and now I can’t look away from the top left...
25-07-2019T21:00:43,SageSaga,She's normally a man but some people prefer to draw him that way...

25-07-2019T21:39:07,Tharkis,"iv'e b een able to make this computer last me more than 7 years so far, nearing 8"
25-07-2019T21:39:15,Tharkis,but that means i need to build something new soon myself =(
25-07-2019T21:39:18,FloofyCat,Nah this is an old page
25-07-2019T21:39:34,Tharkis,2011 chipset motherboard is unfortunate
25-07-2019T21:39:34,ContagiousBordem16,Wat?
25-07-2019T21:39:35,Bgrmystr2,page from 1746
25-07-2019T21:39:36,Ordithus,This PC's original build is 8 years old.  Upgraded a few things along the way
25-07-2019T21:39:42,Tharkis,even though it's a nice asus sabertooth mobo
25-07-2019T21:39:43,ContagiousBordem16,?
25-07-2019T21:39:49,Tharkis,there's no real way for me to upgrade it
25-07-2019T21:39:51,ContagiousBordem16,:ptv-confused:
25-07-2019T21:40:07,Tharkis,because they only made 4 processors for 2011 chipset / socket before changing
25-07-2019T21:40:09,NextGenAnubisKid,My laptop is only 3 summers old but it acts like it's 7
25-07-2019T21:40:33,NextGenAnubisKid,Should have gone for an SSD
25-07-2019T21:40:46,AspiringNoodle,My PC is 6.5 years old :3
25-07-2019T21:40:46,SageSaga,just install one
25-07-2019T21:40:57,AspiringNoodle,It's on its last legs... but I'm building a new one! :D
25-07-2019T21:41:05,AspiringNoodle,The next one will probably get upgrades along the way.
25-07-2019T21:41:07,FloofyCat,"SSDs, the only option if you want to not reinstall windows every two years because bad sectors"
25-07-2019T21:41:09,NextGenAnubisKid,My laptop isn't easily customizable
25-07-2019T21:41:29,Bgrmystr2,"lol wtf kinda broken HDD did you get, Floofy"
25-07-2019T21:41:50,NextGenAnubisKid,"Like, I can't replace the SSD without taking the entire underside off"
25-07-2019T21:41:58,Ordithus,Worth
25-07-2019T21:42:06,FloofyCat,WD Blues because cheap. Tbf they last longer but I really get screwed by the hard drive lottery
25-07-2019T21:42:22,SageSaga,that's fine AnubisKid- do it XD
25-07-2019T21:42:32,FloofyCat,Every single bad sector I've had has been in the windows folder and made it so I can't boot.
25-07-2019T21:42:38,Bgrmystr2,I don't think I've ever gotten bad sectors :thinking:
25-07-2019T21:42:50,SageSaga,you probably just never noticed
25-07-2019T21:42:53,NextGenAnubisKid,I guess I'll add it to my list of things to do this weekend then XD
25-07-2019T21:42:55,FloofyCat,But its cool because I just have to reinstall windows and move all the stuff
25-07-2019T21:42:59,Bgrmystr2,"no, I have tools to tell me"
25-07-2019T21:43:11,Bgrmystr2,and I have all my old drives from when I was a kid.
25-07-2019T21:43:18,FloofyCat,Lucky
25-07-2019T21:43:20,SageSaga,so its a year old?
25-07-2019T21:43:26,FloofyCat,Pfffft
25-07-2019T21:43:33,Bgrmystr2,hur hur
25-07-2019T21:43:41,FloofyCat,"Also, rip the TF2 economy."
25-07-2019T21:43:43,SageSaga,got em
25-07-2019T21:43:50,Tharkis,the problem with building a 'latest bleeding edge' computer is sometimes the latest and greatest new thing... is found to be not so good and the industry moves on >_<
25-07-2019T21:44:00,Tharkis,"LGA-2011 was great, allowed more than 4 cores!"
25-07-2019T21:44:02,Bgrmystr2,try more than 20+ year old drives. :P
25-07-2019T21:44:12,Bgrmystr2,I think one's 25+
25-07-2019T21:44:19,Tharkis,but it had problems =/  so they went to new spec almost immediately
25-07-2019T21:44:37,SageSaga,why the heck are you using a 200GB HDD?
25-07-2019T21:44:51,SageSaga,or is that a 60GB?
25-07-2019T21:44:55,FloofyCat,20+ year old is probably not even that
25-07-2019T21:44:57,SageSaga,wait- older-
25-07-2019T21:45:02,SageSaga,1GB
25-07-2019T21:45:20,Ordithus,You'll never fill that
25-07-2019T21:45:28,Ordithus,That's like 1000 floppies!
25-07-2019T21:45:30,FloofyCat,We're talking under 500MB
25-07-2019T21:45:35,HeresyArtStream,I probably have some 20+ year old hard drives somewhere. :cheresyartstream-ponderingfox:
25-07-2019T21:45:35,Bgrmystr2,"the oldest drives I used as primary were 60gb, but I have a 10gb from a family pc that I used way back"
25-07-2019T21:45:44,SageSaga,i need my 6TBs
25-07-2019T21:45:48,CrRAR,Windows 10 is silly how HDD/SSD intensive it is. It just does lots of stuff in parallel.
25-07-2019T21:45:48,HeresyArtStream,My C64's floppy drive is probably older than me. :B
25-07-2019T21:45:56,BluePhantom90,BTW Tom did that Neuro help with getting some sleep that I gave you at the Anthrocon?
25-07-2019T21:46:14,FloofyCat,If its legit 20 years old we're talking at maximum 340MB or something
25-07-2019T21:46:15,CrRAR,"Also, late-stage Windows 7 has some stupid amounts of I/O especially around updates time."
25-07-2019T21:46:36,Twokinds,lol
25-07-2019T21:46:39,Bgrmystr2,"1999 is 20 years ago, Floofy, so.."
25-07-2019T21:46:40,Twokinds,Well I've never had trouble sleeping
25-07-2019T21:46:41,ZRO4825,I need to acquire at least a 4TB drive. I filled up this 2TB for Steam already. <_<;;

25-07-2019T21:47:28,SageSaga,and my alarm didnt even wake him up
25-07-2019T21:47:29,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Tell me your secret Tom, what is this power of sleep?"
25-07-2019T21:47:33,CrRAR,"So much activity, then practically probably collapses."
25-07-2019T21:47:37,BluePhantom90,Lol well I mean it would have helped when you Traveled to Comic con and adjust to the time lag
25-07-2019T21:47:51,CrRAR,*hurk blergh*
25-07-2019T21:48:02,Bgrmystr2,"I sleep fairly well at conventions too, being worn out"
25-07-2019T21:48:07,SpazztasticKiwi,when you’re used to walking on eggshells so chaos don’t erupt around you in the form of barkbarkbarkbarkbark
25-07-2019T21:48:09,Twokinds,"XD I dunno, I just hit the pillow and lights out."
25-07-2019T21:48:14,Twokinds,Conventions are exhausting for me.
25-07-2019T21:48:24,FloofyCat,I slept longer in 100 degree heat than I slept this morning in like 90 degree heat... somehow.
25-07-2019T21:48:26,Tharkis,yeah i mean holy crap was your table busy at AC
25-07-2019T21:48:37,Tharkis,i bet SDCC felt like a vacation after th at
25-07-2019T21:48:38,SpazztasticKiwi,you tend to go out like a gas leak goes off when such concepts are removed
25-07-2019T21:48:39,SageSaga,i pretend to sleep so Tom doesnt worry
25-07-2019T21:48:42,CrRAR,lol
25-07-2019T21:48:48,Ordithus,ha

25-07-2019T21:49:11,Mihari,I pretend to be OK so Sage doesn't worry.
25-07-2019T21:49:13,CrRAR,"Tom to Sage: ""You will go to sleep... or I will put you TO SLEEP"""
25-07-2019T21:49:14,BluePhantom90,Yeah it was kinda my fault to hold up a line when I bought like $200 worth of stuff from Tom for 3 friends and myself
25-07-2019T21:49:20,SageSaga,Mihari does do that
25-07-2019T21:49:22,FloofyCat,Well Sage's dreams never came true
25-07-2019T21:49:28,Tharkis,"everyone i was at AC with stayed up till 4am drawing and stuff in the zoo every night, but i was trying to get up when things started in the mornings"
25-07-2019T21:49:36,SageSaga,only because Lann promised he would take a knife for me
25-07-2019T21:49:38,Tharkis,so i could do things like get doodles from Sage and Tom
25-07-2019T21:49:44,CrRAR,nice

25-07-2019T21:49:50,Twokinds,I swear the person in the hotel next to me at SDCC was dying.
25-07-2019T21:49:52,Tharkis,somehow managed to get Fluff Kevlar to draw in my sketchbook after like 6 years =D
25-07-2019T21:50:00,NextGenAnubisKid,*Con

25-07-2019T21:50:31,Twokinds,"But the thing is, it was so intermittant. Like, he'd stop breathing for 15 - 20 seconds at a time."
25-07-2019T21:50:31,Ordithus,Maybe he was cutting some wood
25-07-2019T21:50:45,SageSaga,his brother doesnt live close enough to the con
25-07-2019T21:50:45,Tharkis,"severe sleep apnea, wonder if they even know they have it"
25-07-2019T21:50:49,SpazztasticKiwi,isn’t that a medical condition
25-07-2019T21:50:50,CrRAR,For a sec there I was gonna say maybe REALLY commited zombie cosplayer
25-07-2019T21:50:55,MarvTheHugPharaoh,He's getting that pro level mediation going
25-07-2019T21:50:57,Tharkis,"half the time people who have it dont even know they have it, and just feel tired all the time"
25-07-2019T21:51:00,Mihari,I can never see Fluff at a con even if I did go XD
25-07-2019T21:51:16,CrRAR,That sounds like sleep apnea
25-07-2019T21:51:17,Nandred,Neeero!
25-07-2019T21:51:20,SageSaga,you would be attacked by a goblin
25-07-2019T21:51:21,CrRAR,The no breathing part
25-07-2019T21:51:26,Nandred,this is the latest i've ever see you on boi!
25-07-2019T21:51:32,Twokinds,"I worry for that guy, mystery snoring guy next door"
25-07-2019T21:51:37,Mihari,That's putting it nicely.
25-07-2019T21:51:38,Ordithus,Tom should've knocked on his door in the middle of the night
25-07-2019T21:51:42,MikeHollard,RPD
25-07-2019T21:51:42,Twokinds,"But even then, I had no trouble falling asleep."
25-07-2019T21:51:44,Tharkis,i had a secret weapon at AC
25-07-2019T21:51:45,Ordithus,"""Hey, you have sleep apnea"""
25-07-2019T21:51:53,CrRAR,Well he made it to a con so he's got that going for him
25-07-2019T21:51:58,BluePhantom90,Fluff was at the Con and I had him sign a Sketch he said wasn't good enough to print
25-07-2019T21:51:59,CrRAR,which is nice
25-07-2019T21:52:00,Tharkis,while other artists were all trading sketch books to art-trade with eachother
25-07-2019T21:52:07,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d rather have a guy practicing intermediate dry snorkeling next door than an overexcited couple
25-07-2019T21:52:07,Tharkis,my 'art' for trade was pre-made >_<
25-07-2019T21:52:09,FloofyCat,How many of you all went to AC?

25-07-2019T21:53:20,Tharkis,so even artists who got 0.5mm pencils last time will have a reason to want to doodle in my sketchbook again =D
25-07-2019T21:53:39,Tharkis,I had to go to AC to check out Nekonny's table setup =P
25-07-2019T21:53:49,Tharkis,i hauled back the train stuff from tokyo for him

25-07-2019T23:20:02,AspiringNoodle,It took me forever to get the hand looking right
25-07-2019T23:20:02,SageSaga,the trick to hands is to break em down
25-07-2019T23:20:06,HenpaiDesu,or do non-humans
25-07-2019T23:20:20,HenpaiDesu,but have to learn to draw animal structures

25-07-2019T23:20:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Got it

25-07-2019T23:20:51,HenpaiDesu,or get a hand figure
25-07-2019T23:20:55,HenpaiDesu,i know you can buy them
25-07-2019T23:20:56,SpazztasticKiwi,marv is maka joke there but it’s a bit much
25-07-2019T23:20:57,AspiringNoodle,There's a fun meme where you find a piece of art
25-07-2019T23:21:03,AspiringNoodle,Then someone recreates the image in 3d space
25-07-2019T23:21:11,AspiringNoodle,"Holy distorted proportions, Batman"
25-07-2019T23:21:15,HenpaiDesu,or get something stupid like putting a lot of clay in a plastic glove
25-07-2019T23:21:28,HenpaiDesu,form it however you like
25-07-2019T23:21:29,HenpaiDesu,ez

25-07-2019T23:22:01,SpazztasticKiwi,make characters non humanoid and you can make their hands look however you plet
25-07-2019T23:22:08,Ordithus,She needs a day off
25-07-2019T23:22:16,SpazztasticKiwi,please
