05-10-2019T15:35:56,TeapotOfDoom,now it seems to be working kinda
05-10-2019T15:36:00,FloofyCat,It must be cold with the covers down
05-10-2019T15:36:10,FloofyCat,How can you have a good night's sleep whilst only half-covered?!

05-10-2019T15:41:20,TeapotOfDoom,never seen that movie tbh
05-10-2019T15:41:52,FloofyCat,I wonder what species Tom's second choice would've been for Flora.
05-10-2019T15:42:00,CrRAR,Then who was iceberg?
05-10-2019T15:42:21,CommanderTrace,Hello guys ;D
05-10-2019T15:42:21,IronHorseComics,"the iceberg was Clovis, obviously"
05-10-2019T15:42:32,BadFoMo,Never really seen it too. Saw the Futurama version though.
05-10-2019T15:42:35,PalmettoPathfinder1,I'm watching a lot of old 80s shows.
05-10-2019T15:42:45,PalmettoPathfinder1,Like Buck Rogers in the 25th Century.
05-10-2019T15:42:48,ContagiousBordem16,Titanic was Eric’s ship

05-10-2019T15:43:15,ContagiousBordem16,Which is why roses drawings and Eric’s make sense
05-10-2019T15:43:28,PalmettoPathfinder1,Boy they got away with some stuff back then.  Violence wasn't one of them.  Topless women (as long as you didn't see anything) were okay.
05-10-2019T15:44:06,ContagiousBordem16,bruh titanic was R rated Bruh
05-10-2019T15:44:49,BadFoMo,@PalmettoPathfinder1 I thought that second one was still true today?
05-10-2019T15:45:02,ContagiousBordem16,Didn’t Tom draw saria Drawing rose (TK) like they did in titanic
05-10-2019T15:45:07,BadFoMo,Did the music just skip?
05-10-2019T15:45:27,PalmettoPathfinder1,@BadFoMo....Actually that is true.
05-10-2019T15:45:35,BadFoMo,@ContagiousBordem16 I think he did.
05-10-2019T15:45:57,ContagiousBordem16,Oh they’re making a second titanic
05-10-2019T15:46:02,FloofyCat,There's the meme thing but I think that was Trace doing the drawing.
05-10-2019T15:46:12,ContagiousBordem16,I almost forgot about that
05-10-2019T15:47:01,ShamusTheFox,Seeing this pic makes me want to sleep in a sunbeam.

05-10-2019T19:01:50,Vatruvius,If it is causing this much of a set back you could return the power supply and order another one with same day or next day shipping if it isn't ludicrously expensive.
05-10-2019T19:01:55,TeapotOfDoom,then at least the rnd process should be straight forward right?

05-10-2019T21:42:44,AspiringNoodle,#DeathToRetail :3
05-10-2019T21:44:55,Dadrobit,"Retail is definitely dying, but then you're just going to be shit outta luck unless you train for a new job."
05-10-2019T21:46:27,Dadrobit,"Within the next two decades, damn near everything will be self-serve automated and the shift manager is going to be the lone human front end resource."
05-10-2019T21:46:44,AcePilotIV,yh probaly
05-10-2019T21:48:21,Dadrobit,"Even Dominoes is doing it with their Pizza Portal. Order online, go in, and take the pizza away from the Portal without ever having to speak with anyone"
05-10-2019T21:52:06,AcePilotIV,Not that ive ever had dominos
05-10-2019T21:52:49,AspiringNoodle,"Tbh, we're getting closer and closer to a future where Universal Basic Income (UBI) will be a serious discussion."
05-10-2019T21:53:16,AspiringNoodle,You can't just keep taking jobs away without replacing them and expect people to NOT be pissed
05-10-2019T21:53:43,Dadrobit,#YangGang
05-10-2019T21:54:16,AspiringNoodle,All the #FightFor15 is doing is serving to accelerate automation
05-10-2019T21:54:28,AcePilotIV,Well the world is beyond fucked at the moment
05-10-2019T21:54:37,AspiringNoodle,"Low skills jobs are easily replaceable with machines, it's just a matter of whether or not it's cost efficient :/"
05-10-2019T21:55:08,Dadrobit,"Yup, $15 an hour just pushes out small businesses, and either forces big business to automate the job or outsource it."
05-10-2019T21:55:25,AspiringNoodle,Here's some super irony
05-10-2019T21:55:38,AspiringNoodle,The decently famous restaurant / bar where AOC worked had to close
05-10-2019T21:55:43,AspiringNoodle,"Because of the $15 min. wage, lol"
05-10-2019T21:56:08,AcePilotIV,Lol
05-10-2019T21:56:43,AspiringNoodle,But yeah.  retail is a garbage industry :P
05-10-2019T21:56:45,Dadrobit,"I don't keep up with her outside of hearing the random blurb here and there, she's a proponent of $15?"
05-10-2019T21:57:02,AspiringNoodle,She just proposed a bill that would give FULL welfare to illegal immigrants
05-10-2019T21:57:04,AspiringNoodle,What do you think?
05-10-2019T21:57:34,Dadrobit,I'm gonna hedge my bets and say probably.
05-10-2019T21:58:35,AspiringNoodle,"On the bright side, we're probably heading towards an entertainment age :D"
05-10-2019T22:00:29,AcePilotIV,still oof
05-10-2019T22:00:48,Dadrobit,The plutocrats are heading into an age of entertainment. WE are headed for a giant fucking ecenomic depression.

05-10-2019T22:21:16,Sclimshady,I would get too distracted working at home
05-10-2019T22:21:23,AcePilotIV,same
05-10-2019T22:21:31,AspiringNoodle,"Sclim, y ou have not mastered procrastination like I have, lol"
05-10-2019T22:21:38,RimaDraws,i like being away from people too much
05-10-2019T22:21:38,AcePilotIV,lol
05-10-2019T22:22:03,AcePilotIV,why?
05-10-2019T22:22:04,Sclimshady,"I work with one other person,  and we work on seperate platforms"
05-10-2019T22:22:12,Sclimshady,So I get plenty
05-10-2019T22:22:19,RimaDraws,one im an introvert and two i get social anxiety

05-10-2019T22:23:53,AcePilotIV,though these since i hit puberty i lock myself in my room
05-10-2019T22:23:54,Sclimshady,But I got swarmed by a surprise sorority meeting at school ant that freaked me out
05-10-2019T22:24:01,AcePilotIV,oof
05-10-2019T22:24:18,Sclimshady,I dont do crowds well

05-10-2019T22:27:02,AspiringNoodle,I think i got too blinded by the pay
05-10-2019T22:27:05,AspiringNoodle,$9.50 an hour to start
05-10-2019T22:27:27,AspiringNoodle,But sooooo much anxiety when someone walks up for tobacco and they straddle that line between card and no card
05-10-2019T22:28:32,Sclimshady,9.50 is not worth it for any job with even the slightest danger or anxiety
05-10-2019T22:30:14,AspiringNoodle,What makes it worse is that BARS is on the prowl
05-10-2019T22:30:32,AspiringNoodle,"And they can not only fine you for failing to card them, but anyone in front of them that they deem to be young enough for carding :?"
05-10-2019T22:30:36,AspiringNoodle,:/
05-10-2019T22:32:20,AspiringNoodle,"But before I quit, I must look at health insurance plans on the marketplace, and see if there are any within throwing distance of my current job's offerings"
05-10-2019T23:01:41,AcePilotIV,im going byeeeeeee
