17-09-2019T11:09:49,Dadrobit,Just got home from doing a walkthrough with my folks in the abandoned house this morning. Such senseless fucking damage....

17-09-2019T13:15:53,SomeNiceUser,"I decided to reset my laptop, just to remove the pre installed stuff and make it work faster."
17-09-2019T13:28:25,TerraTheWizard,"hey tom, one of the unofficial discords is running an art competition and listing a prize as a sketch from you"
17-09-2019T13:29:01,TerraTheWizard,just wondering how official this is because it feels like exploitation for getting people to join their discord
17-09-2019T13:29:26,TeapotOfDoom,I smell bs
17-09-2019T13:29:37,TerraTheWizard,and the ad is on the stream archive iliar runs
17-09-2019T13:29:43,SomeNiceUser,"If it’s not official, then it’s a recipe for trouble."
17-09-2019T13:29:55,TeapotOfDoom,I smell some hard bs
17-09-2019T13:30:26,TeapotOfDoom,Also evening everybody!
17-09-2019T13:30:45,SomeNiceUser,Evening TeapotOfDoom!

17-09-2019T13:31:31,TeapotOfDoom,Just T xD
17-09-2019T13:31:37,SomeNiceUser,XD
17-09-2019T13:32:14,TeapotOfDoom,I don't see any other kitchen accessory around here so teapot is fine xD
17-09-2019T13:32:30,TeapotOfDoom,I mean we had a bowl of something
17-09-2019T13:32:34,CrimsonQuill,Hiya NiceUser! Hiya Teapot!
17-09-2019T13:32:45,SomeNiceUser,Hi Quill!
17-09-2019T13:32:47,TeapotOfDoom,Yo Quill!
17-09-2019T13:32:59,TeapotOfDoom,I just checked the stream recording
17-09-2019T13:33:03,CrimsonQuill,I have a dilemma.
17-09-2019T13:33:14,TeapotOfDoom,I knew he was going to stream right after I went
17-09-2019T13:33:19,TeapotOfDoom,Tell me
17-09-2019T13:33:36,CrimsonQuill,Either I draw Fireteam Luna Raine's Air Assault Halo armour...
17-09-2019T13:33:47,CrimsonQuill,Or I rot my brain on Skyrim.
17-09-2019T13:34:05,TeapotOfDoom,Sounds like a hard dilemma
17-09-2019T13:34:09,SomeNiceUser,Dragonborn Raine.
17-09-2019T13:34:15,SomeNiceUser,Easy.
17-09-2019T13:34:23,TeapotOfDoom,Ima need some creativity to get my brain away from work
17-09-2019T13:34:31,TeapotOfDoom,So I vote for drawing as well
17-09-2019T13:34:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Hi Kame!
17-09-2019T13:34:44,CrimsonQuill,@TeapotOfDoom she's already booked for Halo
17-09-2019T13:34:45,TeapotOfDoom,Ima work on a track
17-09-2019T13:34:50,CrimsonQuill,Hi Spazz
17-09-2019T13:34:56,TeapotOfDoom,Heyo Spazz
17-09-2019T13:35:34,TeapotOfDoom,I'm all in for cheap club music
17-09-2019T13:35:38,CrimsonQuill,"@SomeniceUser I have a Dragonborn...I could draw my Dragonborn back-to-back with Natani, that'd be cool...Back-to-back archers..."
17-09-2019T13:35:38,TeapotOfDoom,lol
17-09-2019T13:35:42,SomeNiceUser,Greeting Spazz.
17-09-2019T13:36:11,TeapotOfDoom,Dragonborn Nat maybe?
17-09-2019T13:36:16,SomeNiceUser,Would be a cool piece Quill.
17-09-2019T13:37:02,CrimsonQuill,"But at present, I'm sorting out proportions"
17-09-2019T13:37:14,CrimsonQuill,I've finally decided to stop bugging Tom with emails.
17-09-2019T13:37:41,CrimsonQuill,"I'm going to draw the comic, and put it on my Deviantart, because I love Halo and Twokinds and want to mash 'em up a bit."
17-09-2019T13:38:00,CrimsonQuill,Heh...it'll be fun figuring out the story as it happens...
17-09-2019T13:38:13,CrimsonQuill,I know there'll be explosions.
17-09-2019T13:38:20,CrimsonQuill,And some stew maybe.
17-09-2019T13:39:13,SomeNiceUser,"Yes, stew. The stew’s the best part."
17-09-2019T13:40:16,TeapotOfDoom,You mean soup?
17-09-2019T13:40:22,CrimsonQuill,"No, I mean Stew."
17-09-2019T13:40:49,CrimsonQuill,"Y'know, throw meat and veg in a pan, simmer, season, then stick in the oven for a day. Serve."
17-09-2019T13:41:09,SomeNiceUser,It’s pretty good.
17-09-2019T13:43:45,TeapotOfDoom,Da heck
17-09-2019T13:43:51,TeapotOfDoom,For a DAY?
17-09-2019T13:44:18,TeapotOfDoom,I mean there would be more exotic stuff that tastes good so prolly
17-09-2019T13:44:51,CrimsonQuill,"Well, it's nice to just have something you can stick in the oven while you're working, and when you come home, it's all done and tasty."
17-09-2019T13:45:05,CrimsonQuill,One can add flour to thicken the sauce.
17-09-2019T13:49:51,TeapotOfDoom,You ever had real schweinsbraten
17-09-2019T13:59:34,CrimsonQuill,Nope
17-09-2019T14:02:16,iliar,"@TerraTheWizard Yes, this is not an official server. But it seems to me a sketch from Tom is a very motivating prize."
17-09-2019T14:03:13,TerraTheWizard,but how can you get a sketch from tom though?
17-09-2019T14:03:19,TerraTheWizard,he doesn't just hand those out
17-09-2019T14:05:26,iliar,"I prefer not to say ""how"". I’ll just say that the winner will get it. Moreover, international delivery is included in the prize."
17-09-2019T14:05:37,TeapotOfDoom,I just heard my dog bark through two windows and trough my iems while producing an edm track because he could not get up. talk about conditioning
17-09-2019T14:06:12,TeapotOfDoom,Wow iliar
17-09-2019T14:11:57,SomeNiceUser,I’m curious about this Tom discord sketch thing.
17-09-2019T14:12:37,CrimsonQuill,Finally! Proportion guides are tricky to find
17-09-2019T14:13:35,SomeNiceUser,Proportions are also hard to do.
17-09-2019T14:14:01,RimaDraws,Honestly illiar I don’t think this is fair. And I think it should be run by Tom to decide if this is official or not
17-09-2019T14:15:00,TeapotOfDoom,Not taking sides here but why should it be unfair Rima?
17-09-2019T14:15:08,CrimsonQuill,Hi Rima
17-09-2019T14:15:16,TeapotOfDoom,Also o/
17-09-2019T14:15:17,SomeNiceUser,Hi Rima.
17-09-2019T14:48:17,SomeNiceUser,I may have made a big mistake.
17-09-2019T14:48:32,CrimsonQuill,Divulge please
17-09-2019T14:51:04,SomeNiceUser,"I did a fresh start on my laptop, which I did some stuff with Dragon center (it’s a MSI laptop), and now I think it’s locked on certain settings."
17-09-2019T14:51:35,CrimsonQuill,Uh-oh
17-09-2019T14:51:59,SomeNiceUser,And dragon center is nowhere to be seen.
17-09-2019T14:52:04,TerraTheWizard,time to redownload dragon center
17-09-2019T14:53:03,SomeNiceUser,"I am trying to, but I’m having a problem trying to get it too."

17-09-2019T19:34:08,AspiringNoodle,"I buy 5 $2 tickets over 3 days. 2 pairs and a single.  Both pairs had 1 winner each worth $4 (yay, cost of admission!), and the single NOTHING."
17-09-2019T19:35:28,Dadrobit,Uhhh that math sounds off. Sounds like you lost $2
17-09-2019T19:37:49,AspiringNoodle,"And what I'm saying is that it's because I didn't buy that 6th (4th, if we're keeping sequence) ticket :ptv-snicker:"
17-09-2019T19:38:18,CrRAR,Yeah it makes you feel like there's more of a chance.
17-09-2019T19:39:14,CrRAR,"Game psychologists exist and they craft reward systems like that, so you get little drips of excitement."
17-09-2019T19:39:18,AspiringNoodle,"I don't think this ticket pays out $2 prizes, either"
17-09-2019T19:40:34,AspiringNoodle,Just checked 4 of my tickets. $4 and $5 are the lowest prizes on them
17-09-2019T19:40:50,Dadrobit,5 tickets times $2 = $10 spent. 2 times $4 winners = $8. Total loss = $2. Unless I'm misunderstanding?
17-09-2019T19:41:40,AspiringNoodle,"I wasn't quipping about whether I was in the red, black, or grey.  I was making a joke about how lotto players become superstitious"
17-09-2019T19:41:55,Dadrobit,lotto players become broke. That's it
17-09-2019T19:41:58,AspiringNoodle,I buy a lotto ticket 3 times
17-09-2019T19:42:05,CrRAR,"Oh yeah, it's all totally a mind game."

17-09-2019T19:42:10,CrRAR,lol
17-09-2019T19:42:11,AspiringNoodle,I only win on the pairs
17-09-2019T19:42:14,AspiringNoodle,"Therefore, only buy pairs"

17-09-2019T19:43:09,AspiringNoodle,Generally in the 25 - 40 range

17-09-2019T19:46:57,CrRAR,But yeah the lottery up lotto draws here they rejiggered the odds so that jackpots go higher... which sell more tickets when it hits the news... but there's actually fewer winners that way overall.
17-09-2019T19:47:01,Dadrobit,"But before that, I'm gonna head on over to Home Depot and pick up some supplies for my parents so we can get to work renovationg their rental."

17-09-2019T20:46:06,AspiringNoodle,"Then I could plug my headset into the back, and keep the front cleaner"
17-09-2019T20:46:56,CrRAR,Do the speakers have a control pod with ports?
17-09-2019T20:48:05,AspiringNoodle,Nope.  I just have a small pair of vaio speakers.  Two cables.  Power and audio.
