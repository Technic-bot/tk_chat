17-05-2019T00:02:58,SageSaga,"how do you know if its too soon, what if your life is not that long?"
17-05-2019T00:03:07,AspiringNoodle,"LMAO, you're awful!"
17-05-2019T00:03:17,SageSaga,you asked for it!

17-05-2019T00:05:17,SageSaga,i dont even know who you are
17-05-2019T00:05:45,AspiringNoodle,"I'm trying to be a reformed night owl, but these streams are making me slink back to my old ways :p"
17-05-2019T00:07:02,SageSaga,be who you were meant to be
17-05-2019T00:11:06,AspiringNoodle,I wonder when CSP will go on sale again...
17-05-2019T00:11:26,SageSaga,soon
17-05-2019T00:11:34,AspiringNoodle,They do it like every 3 months or something?
17-05-2019T00:11:36,SageSaga,it always goes on sale every few months
17-05-2019T00:11:41,AspiringNoodle,Sweet! :D
17-05-2019T00:12:03,AspiringNoodle,"I feel like art is my mid-life crisis.  If I don't take it up, I'll regret it."
17-05-2019T00:18:40,AspiringNoodle,How many people are in here?
17-05-2019T00:18:40,DNMZ,"Ok time for me to go, take care all.  And great work tonight @Chalodraws and @SageSaga"
17-05-2019T00:18:47,Chalodraws,bye bye
17-05-2019T00:18:48,SageSaga,take care
17-05-2019T00:19:14,AspiringNoodle,Good night
17-05-2019T00:19:18,SageSaga,"Noodle - I had a friend who felt that way- so he went to art school- ended up in graphic design, then ended up in glass blowing, then he ended up working with 3D then 3d printing and guess what he does now?"
17-05-2019T00:19:59,AspiringNoodle,What?
17-05-2019T00:20:07,KarametraChat,sup
17-05-2019T00:20:22,SageSaga,Carpentry - as a hobby- he's a manager at a restaurant
17-05-2019T00:20:29,AspiringNoodle,Interesting.
17-05-2019T00:21:24,JeremyCanine,yo
17-05-2019T00:21:42,Strawbetch,Time for me OBE into the void.
17-05-2019T00:21:51,SageSaga,"plus side though- he was able to design the menus and logo for the store, meeting someone who makes nice glasses from the glass blowing classes, and with his carpentry he was able to build the bar"
17-05-2019T00:22:39,SageSaga,XD Jack of all trades
17-05-2019T00:22:59,Strawbetch,"bye, ye expanded dongs"
17-05-2019T00:23:09,SpazztasticKiwi,uh what
17-05-2019T00:23:20,AspiringNoodle,"Plus side, already kinda got some formal art education.  Got a minor in art since my major already completed about 40% of the credits."
17-05-2019T00:24:09,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d consider being a nurse if it wasn’t for working with people
17-05-2019T00:24:37,SageSaga,i'd like a job as a specter of death
17-05-2019T00:24:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Isn’t “grim reaper” too old for you
17-05-2019T00:25:12,SpazztasticKiwi,You’re gonna need a few more centuries on your belt
17-05-2019T00:25:23,SageSaga,i dont want to kill people- i just want to float around making people uncomfortable
17-05-2019T00:25:30,AspiringNoodle,Ha
17-05-2019T00:25:39,SpazztasticKiwi,You can technically do that now
17-05-2019T00:25:51,SageSaga,yeah but i wanna be paid to do it
17-05-2019T00:25:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Not calling you creepy or anything but anyone can do it
17-05-2019T00:26:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Ever thought of being a debt collector
17-05-2019T00:26:15,SageSaga,Robots took that job
17-05-2019T00:26:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Politician?
17-05-2019T00:26:51,SageSaga,im not stupid enough
17-05-2019T00:27:05,AspiringNoodle,"I wonder how many people wish life were more like fantasy anime.  Yeah, lots of death and conflict, but you could become an adventurer and wear armor or cast spells :p"
17-05-2019T00:27:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I hear you’re doodles are pretty good. Maybe try artist
17-05-2019T00:27:28,AspiringNoodle,^
17-05-2019T00:27:28,SpazztasticKiwi,y o u r
17-05-2019T00:27:34,SageSaga,i dont know why wearing armor is a thing you think of as something people want to do
17-05-2019T00:27:47,AspiringNoodle,;)
17-05-2019T00:28:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d rather not walk around in fantasy armor. too many boob hugging tops
17-05-2019T00:28:23,Mihari,"Likely they are thinking about game and anime rules for armor, less is more on females."
17-05-2019T00:28:25,SageSaga,"""Man! if you lived in a fantasy world- you could wear armor!"""
17-05-2019T00:28:44,AspiringNoodle,"Regular armor is boring, enchanted armor is fun!"
17-05-2019T00:28:52,AspiringNoodle,Assuming it's the non-gropey type
17-05-2019T00:29:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I want to meet the guy who can create breastplates more conformed than any bra fitter at Victoria’s Secret
17-05-2019T00:29:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"“Tis I Smitty, the titty smithy”"
17-05-2019T00:30:11,AspiringNoodle,I just remembered this one-page comic.  Lady wearing game-logic armor:  all arrows hit the breastplate and groin covering.
17-05-2019T00:30:27,AspiringNoodle,Guy wearing full body armor: arrow goes through the eye-slit and takes out his eye
17-05-2019T00:30:41,AspiringNoodle,100% legit
17-05-2019T00:31:27,Bgrmystr2,hahahaha kiwi I think there's an anime about that
17-05-2019T00:31:30,SageSaga,"point is- that should probably be ""Being in a fantasy world with- "" -Catgirls, Magic, Elves, amazing food- all of those are things i can be like ""Sure!"" but ""Armor!"""
17-05-2019T00:32:06,AspiringNoodle,"Tbf, I was thinking more along the lines of RPG armor.  You know, the stuff that's imbued with magic and enhances attributes xD"
17-05-2019T00:32:43,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ll take one chest enhancement plate plz
17-05-2019T00:33:22,SpazztasticKiwi,One that’s not vacuum sealed. Boob sweat means rust
17-05-2019T00:33:56,SageSaga,"""What's special about this full plate?"" ""Well it's climate controlled"" ""I'll take it!"""
17-05-2019T00:34:31,AspiringNoodle,"And for the *ahem* endowed ladies, spatial manipulation."
17-05-2019T00:34:34,SpazztasticKiwi,“Why’s this hat 6 different colors and 4 different patterns?”
17-05-2019T00:34:36,Bgrmystr2,"or just get an inner metal that doesn't rust, Kiwi"
17-05-2019T00:34:37,Bgrmystr2,easy
17-05-2019T00:34:56,SpazztasticKiwi,“It regulates body temperature”
17-05-2019T00:35:01,SpazztasticKiwi,“Sold”
17-05-2019T00:35:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"Later, you’re seen walking down the street that would make even a blind man nauseous"
17-05-2019T00:35:57,AspiringNoodle,"Man, if you were an enchanter who could enchant armor / clothing to be comfortable in any weather... you'd make a killing."
17-05-2019T00:36:12,SpazztasticKiwi,~with a hat~
17-05-2019T00:36:25,Strawbetch,"nothin', just an old meme i know"
17-05-2019T00:36:30,SageSaga,"""Arent you hot in that thing?"" *Cold mist pours from the opened visor* ""Nope"" *Closes visor*"
17-05-2019T00:36:35,AspiringNoodle,"Oh man... any time I hear that music, I want to rewatch Ghost in the Shell..."
17-05-2019T00:36:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Sweat windshield wiper hat
17-05-2019T00:36:55,Strawbetch,that one donkey kong one
17-05-2019T00:37:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Imagine talking to someone and their hat starts wiping their face
17-05-2019T00:37:35,Chalodraws,Okaaay. I think I will continue this page tomorrow
17-05-2019T00:37:37,AspiringNoodle,"Oh man, there's an idea.  Warrior in full platemail walking through a snowbank.  Huge billows of steam rising up."
17-05-2019T00:37:49,Mihari,"If I was an enchanter I'd forget the armor buisness, I'd make a bra that auto sizes and fully supports any size / woman. That would make me a fortune."
17-05-2019T00:37:58,Chalodraws,Thanks for having me. See ya all laters!
17-05-2019T00:38:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Tru
17-05-2019T00:38:03,AspiringNoodle,See ya!
17-05-2019T00:38:14,SageSaga,take care Chalo rest well!
17-05-2019T00:38:24,Bgrmystr2,ahh seeya chalo
17-05-2019T00:38:32,Mihari,Take care Chalo
17-05-2019T00:38:47,SageSaga,and yes Mihari- in a fantasy world with fantasy boobs that would be epic
17-05-2019T00:38:49,SpazztasticKiwi,How about a magic bra that helps reduce/grow boobage so the woman is comfortable
17-05-2019T00:39:06,Mihari,I think if you just had support it wouldn't matter.
17-05-2019T00:39:06,AspiringNoodle,That would also get you stupidly rich
17-05-2019T00:39:24,AspiringNoodle,magical plastic surgeons...
17-05-2019T00:39:27,Mihari,"But I guess that would be good too, lord knows I wish mine were smaller."
17-05-2019T00:39:29,AspiringNoodle,Could make you look any way you want...
17-05-2019T00:39:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I got support. There’s just not alot to support
17-05-2019T00:41:14,AspiringNoodle,The animu is strong tonight
17-05-2019T00:43:42,AspiringNoodle,Everyone see Detective Pikachu yet? :p
17-05-2019T00:44:40,Mihari,No.
17-05-2019T00:44:51,AspiringNoodle,Do it.  It's sooooooooo good <3
17-05-2019T00:44:54,Bgrmystr2,"you make the assumption that some of us can pay for that? And if we even had the money, that we would go see it?"
17-05-2019T00:45:08,AspiringNoodle,That's a fair point.
17-05-2019T00:45:24,SageSaga,it is a good movie though
17-05-2019T00:45:40,SpazztasticKiwi,eh. I’ll get to it eventually
17-05-2019T00:46:56,SonGojin,I hope to go see it with my little bro.
17-05-2019T00:47:14,AspiringNoodle,I still remember when they were tossing out potential celebrities to voice DP.
17-05-2019T00:47:21,AspiringNoodle,I'm glad they got the voice of DP to voice DP :p
17-05-2019T00:48:50,SageSaga,"XD when i mentioned that i was going to see it- my mother was like ""Oh are you going to take your little nephews to go see it?"" i said ""Heck no, they'd ruin it for me!"""
17-05-2019T00:48:51,SonGojin,I feel like Danny Devito would have had me laughing my ass of though. Course that might just be the little boy that watched disney's Hercules over and over again.
17-05-2019T00:49:16,SonGojin,inside me
17-05-2019T00:49:48,AspiringNoodle,"Personally, I think the cognitive dissonance of Ryan Reynolds makes it better"
17-05-2019T00:50:37,SonGojin,oh I know. I'm just saying because Danny has experience playing short not human characters.
17-05-2019T00:51:05,SageSaga,ok please change the subject
17-05-2019T00:51:29,SonGojin,oh sorry.
17-05-2019T00:51:39,SageSaga,i can just see someone joining and seeing the conversation and spoiling something
17-05-2019T00:51:43,AspiringNoodle,^
17-05-2019T00:51:46,AspiringNoodle,That's what I figured
17-05-2019T00:52:09,LannAF,*hops in*
17-05-2019T00:52:11,LannAF,HEY
17-05-2019T00:52:18,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Lann
17-05-2019T00:52:21,LannAF,I got something to talk about
17-05-2019T00:52:24,AspiringNoodle,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but is this Jack Black singing?"
17-05-2019T00:52:25,LannAF,and it involves
17-05-2019T00:52:26,SonGojin,NO
17-05-2019T00:52:31,LannAF,how tired I am
17-05-2019T00:52:36,SonGojin,oh....
17-05-2019T00:52:36,LannAF,hi Marv :D
17-05-2019T00:52:37,AspiringNoodle,How tired are you?
17-05-2019T00:52:40,Mihari,"Somehow I even heard Lann saying that ""Heeeeyyy"" and being overly loud in my headphones."
17-05-2019T00:52:44,SageSaga,this is Jack Black's Wonder Boy
17-05-2019T00:52:47,LannAF,"on a scale of 1-10, an 8"
17-05-2019T00:53:05,AspiringNoodle,I'm floating between 6 and 9.
17-05-2019T00:53:10,LannAF,I'm at one of those points where I feel like I accomplished nothing
17-05-2019T00:53:15,LannAF,so I don't want to sleep
17-05-2019T00:53:29,LannAF,yet I'm sitting here talking to other people who feel and are doing the same
17-05-2019T00:53:34,LannAF,instead of sleeping
17-05-2019T00:53:37,LannAF,I love that feeling
17-05-2019T00:53:44,AspiringNoodle,I've been doing research recently
17-05-2019T00:54:08,AspiringNoodle,My brain is more or less tired from assimilating all this [partially useless] knowledge
17-05-2019T00:54:42,SageSaga,im accomplishing a lot
17-05-2019T00:55:07,LannAF,and that is why I am not talking to you
17-05-2019T00:55:12,SageSaga,ouch
17-05-2019T00:55:13,AspiringNoodle,haha
17-05-2019T00:55:14,LannAF,That was a joke
17-05-2019T00:55:18,LannAF,If anyone didn't catch that.
17-05-2019T00:55:24,LannAF,hahaha
17-05-2019T00:55:32,AspiringNoodle,"Well, at least you're not stressed to the point of being inable to sleep."
17-05-2019T00:55:34,LannAF,sorry sage
17-05-2019T00:55:35,SageSaga,go bed lann- you're tired
17-05-2019T00:55:43,LannAF,yeah you know I'm tired when I say rude stuff
17-05-2019T00:56:00,LannAF,"Aspiring, only certain types of stress do that to me"
17-05-2019T00:56:12,LannAF,"You have a good point sage, and I think it's a grand idea that I should follow"
17-05-2019T00:56:24,LannAF,I will follow up on it soon:tm:
17-05-2019T00:56:36,LannAF,Otherwise I sleep almost instantly all the time
17-05-2019T00:56:39,AspiringNoodle,What kinds of stress keep you up at night?
17-05-2019T00:56:52,LannAF,"Stress of not knowing if someone is okay, mostly."
17-05-2019T00:56:59,SageSaga,you're starting to look like the super drunk guy that just walked into the wrong place
17-05-2019T00:57:11,LannAF,I'm not at that point
17-05-2019T00:57:18,AspiringNoodle,Most stresses make me tired.
17-05-2019T00:57:25,AspiringNoodle,Life decision stresses keep me up :p
17-05-2019T00:57:49,LannAF,"Stresses exhaust me but I can usually sleep a lot of them off, unless I have work"
17-05-2019T00:57:56,LannAF,in which case I wake up stressed.
17-05-2019T00:58:33,LannAF,I'm honestly extremely thankful for my ability to sleep. I chalk it up to highschool and my shitty sleep habits but it's never left me.
17-05-2019T00:59:06,LannAF,Most of my family has insomnia so it's...Good luck I guess
17-05-2019T00:59:25,SageSaga,well ya better sleep well and have fun at D&D tomorrow
17-05-2019T00:59:31,AspiringNoodle,"I'm sure I'll experience more types of stress later in life.  But for now it's either been the ""make me tired"" or ""I'm having a panic attack"" kind."
17-05-2019T00:59:47,AspiringNoodle,The latter I am not a fan of.
17-05-2019T01:00:15,LannAF,man I am SO looking forward to it
17-05-2019T01:00:29,LannAF,"oof, panic attack stress is definitely the shittiest"
17-05-2019T01:00:46,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"oooh more ERP, Lann?"
17-05-2019T01:00:55,LannAF,Thankfully DnD is at night so I have plenty of rest and relaxation time
17-05-2019T01:01:02,LannAF,Marv there was and WILL BE NO ERP
17-05-2019T01:01:09,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
17-05-2019T01:01:54,LannAF,"oh shoot, I forgot to save the VOD and upload it"
17-05-2019T01:02:04,LannAF,thanks for reminding me of something I'll do tomorrow probably
17-05-2019T01:02:14,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:thumbsup::cmarvthehugpharaoh-ezgifcom-crop:
17-05-2019T01:04:12,LannAF,Well I'm going to take Sage's advice and head to bed
17-05-2019T01:04:23,LannAF,I hope you all have a fantastic night
17-05-2019T01:04:25,MarvTheHugPharaoh,nighty night Lann
17-05-2019T01:04:27,SageSaga,sleep well man
17-05-2019T01:04:34,LannAF,thanks buddies
17-05-2019T01:04:36,AspiringNoodle,Sleep well :D
17-05-2019T01:04:42,LannAF,oh I will
17-05-2019T01:04:52,LannAF,I'm close to falling asleep in my chair
17-05-2019T01:04:52,AspiringNoodle,Don't stress on us >:3
17-05-2019T01:09:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Anxiety: “worry” me: “why? The days free - everything’s caught up”
17-05-2019T01:10:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Anxiety “because fuck you that’s why”
17-05-2019T01:10:12,AspiringNoodle,Pretty much!
17-05-2019T01:10:50,SpazztasticKiwi,That good ol feeling of constantly feeling buzzy. If only it burned calories
17-05-2019T01:11:23,AspiringNoodle,"If metabolism scaled with anxiety, I'd be a healthy weight, haha"
17-05-2019T01:11:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d actually look like a super model
17-05-2019T01:12:07,SageSaga,alright looks like im done for tonight- i'll be streaming again in 12 hours and 48 minutes
17-05-2019T01:12:08,AspiringNoodle,Pre or post-Photoshop? xD

17-05-2019T01:15:17,SpazztasticKiwi,"pre photoshop duh. That much weight loss, I’d have to eat huge meals not to look like a stick"
17-05-2019T01:17:08,AspiringNoodle,I wonder how long before Photoshop loses its top spot.
17-05-2019T01:17:37,SageSaga,unlikely to happen any time soon because of industry use
17-05-2019T01:18:23,AspiringNoodle,It's not that I hate the software.  It's just Adobe is a less than likable company.
17-05-2019T01:19:22,AspiringNoodle,"Ah well, time will tell.  Good night!"
17-05-2019T01:23:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Kitty is being cute
17-05-2019T01:23:38,SpazztasticKiwi,I suspect he wants treats
17-05-2019T02:16:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Anyone want to see a funny guy version of all about that bass

17-05-2019T13:18:31,CrimsonQuill,This probably means there won't be a poll on the day...
17-05-2019T13:27:22,Orthonox,Suggestions poll? Okay. I do not have a problem with voting only going to $5+ patrons if it has good turnout.

17-05-2019T14:20:46,SageSaga,how is it a surprise?

17-05-2019T14:21:59,SageSaga,ah- well i always stream at this time on this day :P
17-05-2019T14:22:13,AspiringNoodle,Oh really?  *adds note to calender*

17-05-2019T14:25:36,SageSaga,yeah i just re-added it- i saw it was off and went to turn it on - and it was on
17-05-2019T14:26:05,SageSaga,or right- i cleaned up some files and moved stuff around- i must have moved the wrong copy of it
17-05-2019T14:26:51,CrimsonQuill,I'm multitasking here
17-05-2019T14:27:04,CrimsonQuill,I'm watching the stream while playing Undertale
17-05-2019T14:27:20,AspiringNoodle,dual monitors?
17-05-2019T14:27:24,AspiringNoodle,Or windowed Undertale? :P

17-05-2019T14:32:02,FloofyCat,I need whatever caffeine Keith is having
17-05-2019T14:32:13,CrimsonQuill,"That's not Keith, Floofy"
17-05-2019T14:32:19,CrimsonQuill,It's King Adelaide.
17-05-2019T14:32:20,FloofyCat,Wait
17-05-2019T14:32:28,FloofyCat,No it isn't I definitely need the caffeine
17-05-2019T14:32:30,CrimsonQuill,That's who is drinking the tea.
17-05-2019T14:32:56,FloofyCat,Quill I think it just speaks more to the need for caffeine
17-05-2019T14:33:14,FloofyCat,aaahhhhhhh
17-05-2019T14:34:19,CrimsonQuill,"That's a bit like Doc from ""The Whiteboard"" when he doesn't have coffee or mountian dew...."
17-05-2019T14:34:35,AspiringNoodle,Mountain Dew sounds so good right now
17-05-2019T14:37:06,CrimsonQuill,I never touch the stuff.
17-05-2019T14:37:24,CrimsonQuill,I prefer apple-blackcurrant squash or tea or water or orange juice.
17-05-2019T14:37:41,AspiringNoodle,Ever try 5HE?
17-05-2019T14:38:48,CrimsonQuill,No
17-05-2019T14:38:51,CrimsonQuill,What is it?
17-05-2019T14:39:00,AspiringNoodle,5 hour energy :p
17-05-2019T14:39:27,CrimsonQuill,Thanks but no thanks. I'll stick to Porridge.
17-05-2019T14:40:57,FloofyCat,That sounds like 5 kilograms of sugar
17-05-2019T14:42:15,AspiringNoodle,"I think it has sugar.  It also has a bit of caffeine, but no worse than a cup of coffee.  They more or less load the thing with vitamins that make you feel alert."
17-05-2019T14:43:22,Twokinds,Mother made curry this morning. Took a lot of willpower not to have any. ;-;
17-05-2019T14:43:38,Twokinds,Curry is my favorite food.
17-05-2019T14:43:51,CrimsonQuill,"Oh, I love curry"
17-05-2019T14:44:02,SageSaga,Tom is now cliche asian
17-05-2019T14:44:13,CrimsonQuill,And I heard your mum's cooking is really good according to your brothers videos and twitter feeds
17-05-2019T14:44:20,CrimsonQuill,I'd have curry
17-05-2019T14:44:30,CrimsonQuill,"Especially spicy curry,."

17-05-2019T14:47:36,Twokinds,Eeeegh
17-05-2019T14:47:43,Twokinds,How can you have curry without rice?
17-05-2019T14:47:47,Twokinds,It makes no sense.
17-05-2019T14:47:51,CrimsonQuill,Ever tried Schezuan beef Tom?
17-05-2019T14:47:55,CrimsonQuill,It's really nice.
17-05-2019T14:48:02,Twokinds,I don't know.
17-05-2019T14:48:04,CrimsonQuill,I think it's a curry...maybe a stir fry thing?
17-05-2019T14:48:09,CrimsonQuill,It's a Vietnamese dish.
17-05-2019T14:48:20,CrimsonQuill,I'll link a picture if I am allowed.
17-05-2019T14:48:37,SageSaga,i do really miss Rice
17-05-2019T14:48:54,CrimsonQuill,My dad cooks it all the time because it's tasty but doesn't put n too much weight carbwise.
17-05-2019T14:49:00,SageSaga,you can link it - just say what it is before your link
17-05-2019T14:49:33,CrimsonQuill,It's a beef dish served with rice
17-05-2019T14:49:45,CrimsonQuill,https://www.thechunkychef.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/30-Minute-Spicy-Ginger-Szechuan-Beef-2.jpg
17-05-2019T14:49:53,CrimsonQuill,Very tasty
17-05-2019T14:50:05,CrimsonQuill,You can put peppers and ginger in it.#
17-05-2019T14:50:28,FloofyCat,I got leftover curry I need to eat before the rice goes bad.
17-05-2019T14:51:55,FloofyCat,"I only started eating it a few days ago now I kinda like it. I'm lazy though I just buy premade curry sauce, I had something labelled 'hot' and it was mild do I got 'extra extra hot' and it was like... in between medium to hot."
17-05-2019T14:52:37,CrimsonQuill,I generally make mine from scratch. So does my dad.
17-05-2019T14:52:40,FloofyCat,Who labels something 'hot' when its very mild?!
17-05-2019T14:52:52,SageSaga,hot is subjective
17-05-2019T14:52:53,FloofyCat,I would but honestly once the premade stuff goes on sale its kinda cheap.
17-05-2019T14:52:54,CrimsonQuill,"Green curry paste, coconut milk, meat, veg, sultanas, etch."
17-05-2019T14:53:10,FloofyCat,"Yeah to be fair it is subjective, but its not that subjective."
17-05-2019T14:53:45,SageSaga,"it is- some people can barely stand anything hot, some people can eat really hot stuff like its nothing"
17-05-2019T14:53:51,SageSaga,it's extremely subjective
17-05-2019T14:54:37,SageSaga,i know ive told this story here before but im gonna say it again
17-05-2019T14:54:43,FloofyCat,"Most people label habanero and scotch bonnet as 'extra hot'. At least here, in every supermarket they're all labelled that. So its kind of 'extra hot' for a certain scoville range of peppers."
17-05-2019T14:55:10,FloofyCat,I know my mother can't stand anything with the tiniest heat.
17-05-2019T14:55:20,SageSaga,"I was at a wings place, got regular bbq wings- sweet not hot. But some of their hot sauce got on em when they prepped em-"
17-05-2019T14:56:05,sunblaze,#toohottohandle?
17-05-2019T14:56:06,SageSaga,"first time there so i thought it was just normal for them and i looked at my sister and said ""Quick- whats a step down in heat from the regular BBQ?"" and he looked at it and looked back at me and said ""Ranch"""
17-05-2019T14:56:28,SageSaga,she* looked at it- typed too fast
17-05-2019T14:57:09,SageSaga,ive had them there again and they were great- cant have em now because of all the sugar in the sauce- but still
17-05-2019T14:57:26,SageSaga,they put cinnamon in their sauce
17-05-2019T14:59:01,FloofyCat,I dunno if you can measure heat in scovilles for a sauce but if you could it'd be cool if people started using some sort of uniform scale.
17-05-2019T14:59:17,AspiringNoodle,scoville is actually a standard!
17-05-2019T14:59:26,SageSaga,they also have an asian sesame that was great- chili pepper flakes make em a bit tough for me - im terrible with spicy foods
17-05-2019T14:59:36,AspiringNoodle,More or less represents how much capsaicin is present.
17-05-2019T14:59:46,CrimsonQuill,I'm off for the night. Sleep well everyone.

17-05-2019T15:00:46,AspiringNoodle,"I'm tempted to join him, and it's 4 pm for me"
17-05-2019T15:01:07,SageSaga,uhm - if i remember correctly the scoville thing was a taste based system so its flawed
17-05-2019T15:01:31,AspiringNoodle,"If that's true, then it's stupid."
17-05-2019T15:01:41,AspiringNoodle,"If it measured capsaicin concentration, then it's perfect :D"
17-05-2019T15:02:17,MatyMaty,The scoville scale is super flawed :v
17-05-2019T15:02:26,SageSaga,hey Maty!
17-05-2019T15:02:37,MatyMaty,peppers of the same type vary a lot in hotness
17-05-2019T15:02:48,MatyMaty,Sage surely knows why
17-05-2019T15:02:54,MatyMaty,and heyaaa <3
17-05-2019T15:03:34,SageSaga,i assume it's because the way plants work in general but if theres a special reason i'd like to know
17-05-2019T15:03:52,MatyMaty,XD
17-05-2019T15:04:53,AspiringNoodle,"Fun fact, there's a cactus or some other plant out there that contains a chemical that makes capsaicin look like a friggin' wimp."
17-05-2019T15:04:59,MatyMaty,"It is because of the ground where they grow, Sage. The chemicals in the soil change a lot how hot the peppers become"
17-05-2019T15:05:12,SageSaga,"i know they are hot specifically to get animals to not eat them- and all plants vary bit by bit, if they cant get the nutrients they need to produce the capsaicin - yep"
17-05-2019T15:05:36,AspiringNoodle,"If you're a fan of spicy foods, becoming a bird would be the worst thing possible."
17-05-2019T15:05:49,MatyMaty,that's why most time chile pepper plants grown in pots barely have any hotness
17-05-2019T15:06:02,MatyMaty,even if it is peppers that are supposed to be really spicy
17-05-2019T15:06:16,MatyMaty,and that's why the hottest peppers are grown in Asia.
17-05-2019T15:06:20,MatyMaty,at least naturally
17-05-2019T15:06:31,AspiringNoodle,"Pffft, nature is weak"
17-05-2019T15:06:34,MatyMaty,you can fertilize the ground to make the peppers spicy
17-05-2019T15:07:24,MatyMaty,"also Sage, bikini armor for Kaylin when? :v"
17-05-2019T15:07:55,SageSaga,hmm- i drew her in her other set of armor already
17-05-2019T15:09:58,SageSaga,it's pretty nice right?

17-05-2019T15:22:24,MviluUatusun,I've recently finished my weekly grocery shopping so I'm relaxing right now before dinner is cooked.
17-05-2019T15:22:32,FloofyCat,"^ Always a pleasant surprise when Tom streams :p I mean, its not surprising usually but its pleasant."
17-05-2019T15:22:36,AkaihanaTheFox,Didn't know Tom streamed. Just been a passive observer of content for years

17-05-2019T15:27:15,FloofyCat,"But yeah until a month or two ago I didn't know this was a regular thing I just saw the ""Tom is live"" on Patreon and saw it was posted not long ago. I'm not sure how I never noticed the large banner specifically saying ""Friday Art 9PM Sunday Sketch 4PM""?"
17-05-2019T15:28:05,FloofyCat,But then I started watching and made an account on Picarto to comment and the streams are just pleasant.
17-05-2019T15:28:11,Bgrmystr2,"Every time people ask about tom's streaming, I point out the schedule at the top of the stream chat lol"

17-05-2019T15:55:06,FloofyCat,I kinda expect it to be like Hajime no Ippo in one of the many scenes when someone gets oddly serious and they're drawn with all their muscles out of nowhere.

17-05-2019T18:36:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Like how it’s been proposed a few YouTubers try each other after the dumb and dumber fight
