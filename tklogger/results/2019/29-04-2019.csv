29-04-2019T15:21:16,Mippy,Dang Tom! I honestly can‚Äôt wait to see you do a angsty urban fantasy in the future. Your rainy city scapes are alway amazing

29-04-2019T15:56:25,CrimsonQuill,Infinity war was excellent...and now the Endgame is here.
29-04-2019T16:06:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôll tell you this - someone burped and they were shhhed

29-04-2019T20:58:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Listening to Mark describe his infection
29-04-2019T20:59:04,SpazztasticKiwi,...charming
29-04-2019T21:04:45,Ordithus,"He's sick again?!  Poor guy can't catch a break, yikes"
29-04-2019T21:13:16,SpazztasticKiwi,It was a week ago. Seems he‚Äôs over it now but he was describing what the whole thing was
29-04-2019T21:14:35,SpazztasticKiwi,And yes. Mark announcing he‚Äôs sick is a ‚Äúagain?‚Äù thing
29-04-2019T21:14:45,SpazztasticKiwi,As is his nightmare ls
29-04-2019T21:14:56,SpazztasticKiwi,nightmares
29-04-2019T21:37:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Another story: one time in freshman college he drank 6 monsters and 2 five hour energies
29-04-2019T21:37:27,Ordithus,Did he die?
29-04-2019T21:37:28,SpazztasticKiwi,How the hell is this man still alive
29-04-2019T21:37:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Pure spite?
29-04-2019T21:38:23,SpazztasticKiwi,He says all that happened is he woke up a few hours later with his intestines on fire that lasted 30ish minutes
29-04-2019T21:47:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Uh oh. Mark says cooking a steak well done is punishable by death. Wonder if he knows that‚Äôs Tom‚Äôs preference
29-04-2019T21:51:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I might go drown myself in anime for a bit now
