17-01-2019T01:55:28,Bgrmystr2,how is a hospital not open? They think people don't get hurt when they're closed?
17-01-2019T01:58:58,SpazztasticKiwi,So I had cereal. And some got in my bed
17-01-2019T01:59:12,SpazztasticKiwi,A piece just touched my side. Thought it was a bug

17-01-2019T12:25:40,Twokinds,It'd probably need to be longer than 100ft and I don't want a cable running the length of my house.
17-01-2019T12:25:55,swedishkitsune,do you have a main utility hub in the house that have access hatches in the basement?

17-01-2019T16:53:34,Cjero,I want to draw cute animal girls too
17-01-2019T16:53:39,Kameloh,oh what are you trying to learn? drawing or painting?
17-01-2019T16:53:44,Cjero,Both!

17-01-2019T16:54:26,Kameloh,thanks :D
17-01-2019T16:54:45,Kameloh,I always recommend people to draw more than paint
17-01-2019T16:54:50,Kameloh,'cause if you can draw then you can paint
17-01-2019T16:54:55,Kameloh,for the most part :eyes:
17-01-2019T16:54:55,Cjero,"I barely paint, I need to do it more ^^;"
17-01-2019T16:54:57,Cjero,Yeah
17-01-2019T16:55:13,Cjero,I'm also scouring for a teacher both irl or online!
17-01-2019T16:55:38,Kameloh,just draw your favorite things over and over :clap:
17-01-2019T16:55:51,Cjero,"Mmm, I'll start with drawing some of your girls, then, and try my best!"
17-01-2019T16:57:14,PurpleLemons,painting is just thicker drawing
17-01-2019T16:57:25,LargeCreature,^ somewhat agreeing
17-01-2019T16:57:41,Kameloh,XD
17-01-2019T16:58:12,Wertgard,:ptv-laugh:

17-01-2019T16:58:36,Kameloh,"oh I don't do commissions, sorry :D"
17-01-2019T16:58:58,LargeCreature,did you just excuse yourself for doing your own thing x)
17-01-2019T16:59:06,Kameloh,:ckameloh-naokipaper:

17-01-2019T17:00:53,LargeCreature,Comissions are a double edged sword anyway. you gotta make cuts on your art for the sake of selling it. that... is painful
17-01-2019T17:01:05,Wertgard,I know people who want to draw for themselves but can not. And they are sad
17-01-2019T17:01:18,LargeCreature,^

17-01-2019T19:06:52,ThingsAreMoving,yup
17-01-2019T19:07:30,ThingsAreMoving,"the machines that I currently work on have to be loaded by an operator, so there's heavy lifting involved"
17-01-2019T19:07:43,ThingsAreMoving,the job that I apply for has a fully automated system
17-01-2019T19:07:54,ThingsAreMoving,and it's a lot faster
17-01-2019T19:08:09,ThingsAreMoving,"also more complicated to set up, but I'm a smort guy so I should handle it"

17-01-2019T19:25:28,CommanderTrace,should i stream on youtube now?
17-01-2019T19:25:30,CommanderTrace,xD
17-01-2019T19:25:38,Bgrmystr2,nah youtube streaming is pretty bad
17-01-2019T19:25:51,CommanderTrace,its a fortnite stream
17-01-2019T19:26:11,CommanderTrace,:joy:
17-01-2019T19:26:52,ThingsAreMoving,then youtube is the perfect place for you
17-01-2019T19:27:12,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, you'll end up having people watch either way, but I would rather say twitch is the perfect place. That's where people go to stream games and watch streams of games"
17-01-2019T19:27:24,Bgrmystr2,youtube's streaming system is not very well built
17-01-2019T19:27:49,CommanderTrace,yeah youre right but i can multistream
17-01-2019T19:27:52,Bgrmystr2,"and it doesn't save videos or anything, and the comment history is just chucked in the comment section"
17-01-2019T19:28:18,Bgrmystr2,Pretty sure you can multistream on twitch too
17-01-2019T19:29:02,ThingsAreMoving,btw is fortnite the new minecraft? I saw a lot of hate towards this game for some weird reason
17-01-2019T19:29:18,ThingsAreMoving,or is it just the fact that it's free and lots of younglings play it?
17-01-2019T19:31:26,CommanderTrace,no idea but i have been playing fortnite for much longer than most people for more than a year now
17-01-2019T19:32:52,unsteddyphoenix,"It has some minor contriversy, but yeah its mostly the fact that kids play it and kids are annoying"
17-01-2019T19:33:13,Bgrmystr2,"Fortenite is basically a clone of PubG with minecraft-esque mechanics of crafting and building, but without the blocks."
17-01-2019T19:33:45,Bgrmystr2,"so it's not just not original, but it's not trying to be something by itself, it's just trying to be other things and then caters to kids"
17-01-2019T19:33:52,Bgrmystr2,and that's kind of why there's all the hate
17-01-2019T19:34:10,ThingsAreMoving,huh
17-01-2019T19:34:21,ThingsAreMoving,"gaming market 2019, get as many kids as possible"
17-01-2019T19:34:30,Bgrmystr2,naw that's nothing new
17-01-2019T19:34:40,Bgrmystr2,The game industry has been doing that forever
17-01-2019T19:34:43,CommanderTrace,yeah but its not the only game i play  im playing Wot War Thunder  Stormworks and subnautica
17-01-2019T19:34:46,Bgrmystr2,literally nintendo.
17-01-2019T19:35:13,ThingsAreMoving,last nintendo stuff I've owned was a NES
17-01-2019T19:35:38,ThingsAreMoving,"and it wasn't even original, but some russian licensed shit called pegasus system"
17-01-2019T19:36:45,ThingsAreMoving,"I'm waiting for a decent RPG, and hoping that RTS will make some kind of comeback"
17-01-2019T19:37:08,CommanderTrace,how old are you guys?
17-01-2019T19:37:09,ThingsAreMoving,my heart bled when I saw what they did to Command & conquer
17-01-2019T19:37:22,ThingsAreMoving,"I'm 30, 31 in july this year"
17-01-2019T19:37:26,Bgrmystr2,"C&C was never really strategy though, it was more tactical"
17-01-2019T19:37:35,Bgrmystr2,"same as things, 31 in july :O"
17-01-2019T19:37:45,Bgrmystr2,SECRET BROTHERS?!
17-01-2019T19:37:49,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock:
17-01-2019T19:37:51,ThingsAreMoving,"lol, bgr is my lost brother, confirmed"
17-01-2019T19:38:05,CommanderTrace,how old do you think I am?
17-01-2019T19:38:06,ThingsAreMoving,20th of july
17-01-2019T19:38:10,Destro35,Hey
17-01-2019T19:38:12,ThingsAreMoving,"you, bgr?"
17-01-2019T19:38:12,Bgrmystr2,aww
17-01-2019T19:38:15,Bgrmystr2,2nd
17-01-2019T19:38:17,Bgrmystr2,not twins.
17-01-2019T19:38:19,ThingsAreMoving,ayy olderbro
17-01-2019T19:38:24,Bgrmystr2,:D!
17-01-2019T19:38:40,ThingsAreMoving,"commander if I had to guess, you're around 15yo"
17-01-2019T19:39:07,Bgrmystr2,"if you're looking for grand strategy, I'd still recommend Supreme Commander Forged Alliance"
17-01-2019T19:39:22,Destro35,Hey guys
17-01-2019T19:39:24,Bgrmystr2,there's a whole community still playing it even after the servers went down
17-01-2019T19:39:27,CommanderTrace,not bad im 16 and I'll be 17 in september
17-01-2019T19:39:42,Bgrmystr2,"it was made by the same guys who made Total Annihilation, bar none the godfather of RTS games"
17-01-2019T19:40:03,SpazztasticKiwi,I live
17-01-2019T19:40:04,ThingsAreMoving,man I remember that one
17-01-2019T19:40:08,ThingsAreMoving,o/ kiwi
17-01-2019T19:40:09,Bgrmystr2,kiwiiii
17-01-2019T19:40:30,Bgrmystr2,You can also look up Zero-K on steam
17-01-2019T19:40:32,ThingsAreMoving,"Is your shift over now, kiwi?"
17-01-2019T19:40:49,ThingsAreMoving,or is it just lunch time
17-01-2019T19:40:53,Bgrmystr2,which was based off a true 3d engine total annihilation which forked over into it's own game
17-01-2019T19:41:18,ThingsAreMoving,I honestly had high hopes for RUSE a while back
17-01-2019T19:41:31,ThingsAreMoving,but it turned out to be meh^2
17-01-2019T19:42:13,Bgrmystr2,Zero-K and SupCom are both the best in grand RTS far as I've seen. Planetary Annihilation gets 3rd place as they had the right idea but a lot of the things that made TA great they just whiffed right past.
17-01-2019T19:43:02,Bgrmystr2,I dunno of RUSE
17-01-2019T19:46:04,ThingsAreMoving,I'm a bit scared of that Zero-K
17-01-2019T19:46:31,ThingsAreMoving,"""Zero-K is a Real Time Strategy game set near the end of the universe. Manipulate the terrain, *[set things on fire], fight epic battles over land, air and sea. """

17-01-2019T19:47:47,Bgrmystr2,there's all sorts of crazy stuff on it
17-01-2019T19:47:50,ThingsAreMoving,"that was a joke over thar, you know"

17-01-2019T19:48:26,Bgrmystr2,nonsense
17-01-2019T19:48:32,ThingsAreMoving,gonna check it out when I have some time
17-01-2019T19:48:39,Bgrmystr2,":ptv-confused: don't be silly, why would I miss jokes."
17-01-2019T19:49:01,ThingsAreMoving,"dunno, you tell me, mr. missing jokes man"
17-01-2019T19:49:23,ThingsAreMoving,are you ok?
17-01-2019T19:50:32,Bgrmystr2,I've got a bit derp don't mind me

17-01-2019T19:51:36,Bgrmystr2,I'm on BL2 playing an anarchy build on the mechromancer w/ all fire weapons and one rocket... the nukem.
17-01-2019T19:52:01,Bgrmystr2,and I just.. shoot till I have 100+ stacks then nuke anything big and scary
17-01-2019T19:52:03,Bgrmystr2,because bomb
17-01-2019T19:52:17,Bgrmystr2,only get 3 bombs and then ya die and start all over.
17-01-2019T19:52:19,ThingsAreMoving,BL2 was fun
17-01-2019T19:52:36,ThingsAreMoving,"they've announced BL3 recently, didn't they?"
17-01-2019T19:52:56,Bgrmystr2,the dude that wrote BL1 and BL2 isn't part of the company anymore so...
17-01-2019T19:53:04,Bgrmystr2,I'm uh..
17-01-2019T19:53:10,Bgrmystr2,expecting a lackluster game.
17-01-2019T19:53:14,Bgrmystr2,not 100% hype for it
17-01-2019T19:53:41,ThingsAreMoving,well they'd have a hard time to make a villain better (worse) than Jack
17-01-2019T19:54:36,ThingsAreMoving,"and besides, no need for investment in graphics engine, It's all there"
17-01-2019T19:54:45,ThingsAreMoving,all they need is a good story and gameplay mechanics
17-01-2019T19:55:42,Bgrmystr2,"Honestly, Jack started as a good villain at the beginning of the game, but by the end of the game he was just some shit run-of-the-mill ""I'm the bad guy because.. reasons"""
17-01-2019T19:56:10,Bgrmystr2,"and it wasn't just the increased frustration at the player either, cuz that doesn't change the kind of person you are"
17-01-2019T19:56:18,Bgrmystr2,he changed as a person..
17-01-2019T19:56:28,Bgrmystr2,Really didn't like him.
17-01-2019T19:58:25,ThingsAreMoving,I related to him a bit. He was a total asshole just because he could.

17-01-2019T20:05:42,ThingsAreMoving,83F is the norm over here in the summer

17-01-2019T20:09:51,Bgrmystr2,you'd enjoy our winters sorta kinda I guess
17-01-2019T20:10:09,ThingsAreMoving,"I told you about winters in my country, yeah?"
17-01-2019T20:10:13,Bgrmystr2,I dunno?
17-01-2019T20:10:19,Bgrmystr2,"if you did, I don't recall"
17-01-2019T20:10:20,Bgrmystr2,tell me more
17-01-2019T20:10:35,ThingsAreMoving,I once went out for a short walk with my dog with nothing but a matrix style cotton coat and shoes
17-01-2019T20:10:41,ThingsAreMoving,-30C
17-01-2019T20:10:45,ThingsAreMoving,4am no people
17-01-2019T20:11:25,ThingsAreMoving,well... short walk means around 20 minutes
17-01-2019T20:11:49,ThingsAreMoving,that's how much I like cold weather
17-01-2019T20:12:11,CrRAR,Was your door for or against the fridgid walkies?
17-01-2019T20:12:17,CrRAR,*dog
17-01-2019T20:12:43,ThingsAreMoving,"he had to pee and poo, also he was a breed that handled cold pretty well"
17-01-2019T20:13:02,CrRAR,nice
17-01-2019T20:13:17,Bgrmystr2,cold is nice if you're in the heat all the time
17-01-2019T20:13:33,Bgrmystr2,but here there's so much heat that your level of cold is just too damn much discrepancy
17-01-2019T20:13:58,ThingsAreMoving,"well yeah, I'd be scared of this kind of temperature difference"
17-01-2019T20:14:13,ThingsAreMoving,that works both ways
17-01-2019T20:14:35,Bgrmystr2,"I'll say this, my friend alex visited us from sweden.."
17-01-2019T20:15:01,Bgrmystr2,and it just happened to be a really fucking hot summer that year.. was 110F+ with 100% humidity
17-01-2019T20:15:09,Bgrmystr2,but mostly 100+
17-01-2019T20:15:24,ThingsAreMoving,holy :fire:
17-01-2019T20:15:24,Bgrmystr2,was like 109-112 or something?
17-01-2019T20:15:29,Bgrmystr2,yeah he melted
17-01-2019T20:15:31,Bgrmystr2,poor guy
17-01-2019T20:15:46,Bgrmystr2,but we had a lot of fun
17-01-2019T20:16:03,ThingsAreMoving,I think I would just drop in the floor and cry for sweet release from this hellish torment
17-01-2019T20:16:09,ThingsAreMoving,on*
17-01-2019T20:16:33,Bgrmystr2,"best scenario should you visit anywhere with similar heat, make sure you have drinks.. cuz you will sweat it everywhere very quickly"
17-01-2019T20:16:37,Bgrmystr2,and you'll dry out
17-01-2019T20:16:39,ThingsAreMoving,or I'd drink plenty of water and sweat like my life depended on it
17-01-2019T20:16:58,ThingsAreMoving,"ayyy, thinking the same way"
17-01-2019T20:17:59,Bgrmystr2,"my body doesn't replenish electrolites faster than it loses them, so I know very well the problems of dehydration"
17-01-2019T20:18:05,ThingsAreMoving,"during the summer I have over 105F at my workplace, and no airflow cause old building design and no fans to move it around"
17-01-2019T20:18:28,ThingsAreMoving,"I kid you not, I drink on average over 3 liters of water and don't even go to the toilet even once"
17-01-2019T20:18:50,Bgrmystr2,"Of like.. the 5 or 6 times I went to Disney World in Florida, I went to the hospital due to dehydration."
17-01-2019T20:19:04,ThingsAreMoving,oof
17-01-2019T20:19:54,ThingsAreMoving,I don't think I've ever had problems with dehydration
17-01-2019T20:19:57,Bgrmystr2,"I went to a convention in greater New Orleans and ended up going to the hospital then too, missed the whole first day and half the second."
17-01-2019T20:20:21,Bgrmystr2,"hot day, no drink, sit in the back seat of a car with all the blankets."
17-01-2019T20:20:36,ThingsAreMoving,"I mean, maybe the symptoms were there but I tend to 'suck it up' and disregard stuff"
17-01-2019T20:20:39,Bgrmystr2,yeah.. my friends clearly didn't get the memo
17-01-2019T20:20:41,Bgrmystr2,till then
17-01-2019T20:21:30,Bgrmystr2,"it's not fun, tell you what. Keep your liquids up and your drinks on hand"
17-01-2019T20:21:54,ThingsAreMoving,"huh, couldn't you guys just stop for some water at a patrol station or whateveryoucallitatthefreedomcountry"
17-01-2019T20:22:11,ThingsAreMoving,petrol*
17-01-2019T20:22:26,ThingsAreMoving,fuel station?
17-01-2019T20:22:29,ThingsAreMoving,gas station?
17-01-2019T20:23:03,Bgrmystr2,"gas station, and naw cuz it was just a straight shot from the house to the hotel because we were running late"
17-01-2019T20:23:07,Bgrmystr2,and trying to get there in time
17-01-2019T20:23:17,ThingsAreMoving,sacrifices were made
17-01-2019T20:23:20,Bgrmystr2,and it was all on the elevated expressway
17-01-2019T20:23:21,ThingsAreMoving,literally
17-01-2019T20:23:22,ThingsAreMoving,lol
17-01-2019T20:23:23,Bgrmystr2,yeah me.
17-01-2019T20:23:26,Bgrmystr2,I was the sacrifice.
17-01-2019T20:24:16,ThingsAreMoving,I guess dehydration is a thing that hits you without any warnings.
17-01-2019T20:24:37,ThingsAreMoving,"I had anemia once, never noticed it until I had a random blood test."
17-01-2019T20:25:45,Bgrmystr2,"it does come with warnings actually. I mean, it's usually due to just running around and being tired.. and then not actually drinking enough and your throat is try and your body is tired and you're kinda dizzy and you feel nauseated"
17-01-2019T20:25:52,ThingsAreMoving,Weird how sometimes your body can't tell you that something is wrong in a way that's easy to understand
17-01-2019T20:26:15,Bgrmystr2,but not everyone gets those warnings
17-01-2019T20:26:23,Bgrmystr2,I get all of em so I can tell
17-01-2019T20:26:34,Bgrmystr2,but I geuss noone seems to listen till it's too late
17-01-2019T20:26:37,Bgrmystr2,:U
17-01-2019T20:26:58,ThingsAreMoving,well like I said. I tend to have a 'suck it up' attitude
17-01-2019T20:27:15,ThingsAreMoving,also pretty stubborn and strong willpower do their thing too
17-01-2019T20:28:20,Xexanoth,dehydration doesn't give a fuck about your willpower or stubborness
17-01-2019T20:28:32,Combak,"... Huh, Sage isn't in the multi?"

17-01-2019T20:32:01,Xexanoth,well ultimately it is: do you have enough water in your body to keep functioning or do you not and your body collapses

17-01-2019T21:58:56,CodeNameHg17,Bolton Board
17-01-2019T21:59:01,FoxxTrotter,Either a Rolodex or an index card box.
17-01-2019T21:59:03,Twokinds,I've been doing one a day since New Years
17-01-2019T21:59:18,Twokinds,Uh... probably about as common as someone with face tattoos
17-01-2019T21:59:20,unsteddyphoenix,"Oh really, thats how you do it?"
17-01-2019T21:59:28,Ordithus,I expect there are plastic sleeves you can get for a binder
17-01-2019T21:59:30,unsteddyphoenix,Interesting

17-01-2019T21:59:59,MuonNeutrino,what do you mean by 'thumbnailing'?
17-01-2019T22:00:06,Nekonny,"so it's not something that is that crazy, but people dont pay it too much mind?"
17-01-2019T22:00:15,unsteddyphoenix,later things
17-01-2019T22:00:19,Ordithus,Ron!  Is this the same piece you were working on before the cons and such?
17-01-2019T22:00:20,Twokinds,Uh... people would find it odd
17-01-2019T22:00:25,Ordithus,I feel I remember this piece
17-01-2019T22:00:39,Twokinds,"Not like... ""police, help!' odd, but like... well, someone covered in face tattoos odd."

17-01-2019T22:00:47,CatzArt,Thumbnails are little tiny sketches used for planing out your art more or less

17-01-2019T22:01:18,Nekonny,thats an interesting real world analogy
17-01-2019T22:01:31,Twokinds,I draw them on one side and write the script out on the lined front size

17-01-2019T22:02:48,CatzArt,I try to do thumbnails but I always get to detailed with em.
17-01-2019T22:02:49,Bgrmystr2,I think that's the first time you've explained what you did there.
17-01-2019T22:02:50,CrRAR,hey Zahn and cmmdr
17-01-2019T22:02:52,Twokinds,Of course

17-01-2019T22:03:35,Nekonny,to keep it fast?
17-01-2019T22:03:38,unsteddyphoenix,Because you normally cant help yourself in adding detail?
17-01-2019T22:03:39,Twokinds,"That way, if I change my mind about a page, I can just throw it away and I've only wasted 5 minutes"
17-01-2019T22:03:40,unsteddyphoenix,I get that

17-01-2019T22:53:05,Shierna,Kite shields are ridi ulous and unwieldy. They're only meant for phalanx battle.
17-01-2019T22:53:07,CatzArt,yes a snack seems like a good idea Brb
17-01-2019T22:53:28,IceMagic,"Cat, are you gonna get into the dog food?"

17-01-2019T23:12:14,IceMagic,Why would a 100lb stone do more damage than a 200lb human?
17-01-2019T23:12:30,Shierna,Because splat.
17-01-2019T23:12:34,CatzArt,the rock unless the human had the plauge
17-01-2019T23:12:35,CodeNameHg17,This some type of Riddle lol
17-01-2019T23:12:38,draxis556,because hardness

17-01-2019T23:13:00,Ordithus,The hooman refuses to be catapulted

17-01-2019T23:14:21,CatzArt,Now then a question for the medieval inclined. Would you rather have a metal breastplate or a brigandine?
17-01-2019T23:14:33,Ordithus,boobplate
17-01-2019T23:14:44,draxis556,breastplate
17-01-2019T23:14:54,unsteddyphoenix,Breastplate because it gives more AC
17-01-2019T23:15:11,Twokinds,none cause I'm a monk
17-01-2019T23:15:16,Shierna,AgInst what weapons?
17-01-2019T23:15:17,CatzArt,I prefer the brigandine to be honest or a coat of plate works too.

17-01-2019T23:58:46,SageSaga,I will always give the same advice when people ask a public group what to name someone
17-01-2019T23:58:53,Ordithus,Bob
17-01-2019T23:59:00,Mihari,Then you can call her Vivi for short Vicky Vixen XD
17-01-2019T23:59:06,SageSaga,never ask a public group for advice naming something
17-01-2019T23:59:13,BadFoMo,Steve?
17-01-2019T23:59:15,DesertFox,Why not?
17-01-2019T23:59:22,Meeloh,foxes up the place
17-01-2019T23:59:27,Mihari,Cause BadFoMo summed it up
17-01-2019T23:59:43,SageSaga,because you get these people naming a character that should belong to you XD
17-01-2019T23:59:46,MuonNeutrino,asking the public to name something is how you get the internet rickrolling entire baseball stadiums >.>
