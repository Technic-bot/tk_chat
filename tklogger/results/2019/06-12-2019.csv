06-12-2019T00:26:52,Dadrobit,War of the Lions re-re-master for modern consoles. If buy three copies.
06-12-2019T00:27:11,Kynum,TOTALLY
06-12-2019T00:27:25,Kynum,"with, like,...characters that have noses would be nice."
06-12-2019T00:28:25,Ordithus,Did that one still follow Ramza and Delita?

06-12-2019T00:30:00,BadXAsh,I forgot how hard FFT was...
06-12-2019T00:30:06,BadXAsh,It is unforgiving

06-12-2019T00:30:52,BadXAsh,Yeah but that's back in the day when games were harder
06-12-2019T00:30:57,Kynum,I...I guess :ptv-uneasy:
06-12-2019T00:31:00,Ordithus,Learned way too far in to keep multiple saves
06-12-2019T00:31:02,Dadrobit,"And yeah, same characters, a bit more content. Way better language localization."

06-12-2019T00:35:25,Dadrobit,Tactics story is generally pretty brutal. S'why it's my absolute favorite.
06-12-2019T00:35:34,AspiringNoodle,Revitalize old titles via re-releasing on mobile
06-12-2019T00:35:47,Ordithus,It is really pretty fitting with how chapter 4 goes down
06-12-2019T00:36:16,Ordithus,"""Hey, now we're fighting satan.  Wonderful"""

06-12-2019T03:25:49,SageSaga,=_= it's the anime/light novel ive been talking about for the past couple months

06-12-2019T03:33:53,MarvTheHugPharaoh,wb father
06-12-2019T03:34:29,Dadrobit,Just a bit of minor unrulyness at a wedding.
06-12-2019T03:34:52,Dadrobit,It was a bit too loud for how late at night it was
06-12-2019T03:35:17,Dadrobit,They were moderately reasonable about turning it back a bit.
06-12-2019T03:35:48,Dadrobit,Definitely not the worst wedding I've been to back here lol
06-12-2019T03:38:10,SageSaga,Guys- i just found out that not only is a Dub being made for Ascendance of a bookworm- episode 1 dub is already out-
06-12-2019T03:38:31,SageSaga,"which is crazy because 3 days ago i searched to see if it was even getting a dub and the answer i got was ""NO"""
06-12-2019T03:38:57,Dadrobit,Merry Christmas!
06-12-2019T03:40:16,BadFoMo,Herry Christmas!

06-12-2019T03:40:30,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Merry Christmas  :snowman2:
06-12-2019T03:45:21,Xalrog,hello Sage
06-12-2019T03:46:09,SageSaga,yo Xalrog
06-12-2019T03:46:31,Xalrog,sounds like I have a new anime to watch for
06-12-2019T03:48:41,SageSaga,"it's not a super exciting show- but it is a lot of fun- cute, and has a ton of world building that keeps it interesting"
06-12-2019T03:49:09,SageSaga,i was so interested by the first episode that i ended up buying all the current books and read them in a few days
06-12-2019T03:49:23,Xalrog,:open_mouth:
06-12-2019T03:49:40,Dadrobit,"Iirc, that's the one where the girl goes to another world and ends up in medieval times with almost no books and she happens to be a bookeorr?"
06-12-2019T03:49:55,Dadrobit,Bookworm*
06-12-2019T03:50:15,SageSaga,that's mostly right
06-12-2019T03:50:41,SageSaga,the girl dies from an earthquake and gets crushed by book at a library she just started working at
06-12-2019T03:51:01,Dadrobit,"That's ""issekai"" right?"
06-12-2019T03:51:05,SageSaga,and she was reincarnated into the body of a 5 year old
06-12-2019T03:51:09,SageSaga,yeah Isekai
06-12-2019T03:51:42,Dadrobit,I think the closest I've ever come to watching one of those is Escaflowne like 15 years ago....
06-12-2019T03:51:58,Dadrobit,And reading Inuyasha
06-12-2019T03:52:01,SageSaga,the body shes reincarnated into or transferred to is also terminally ill
06-12-2019T03:52:25,Dadrobit,"Ughhhh, that's a hardcore nope for me then."
06-12-2019T03:52:34,SageSaga,nah its great
06-12-2019T03:52:55,Dadrobit,"I'm a pretty desensitized dude, but sick and dying children gets me something fierce."
06-12-2019T03:53:22,SageSaga,her illness is magic that builds up in her system and kills her since she doesnt have magical items to help her release the mana from her body
06-12-2019T03:53:28,SageSaga,so it just builds up till- pop
06-12-2019T03:53:42,Dadrobit,There was an ad campaign a few years back that was brutal with that stuff. From an airline of all places.
06-12-2019T03:54:11,SageSaga,"so she has a terminal illness that has a ""Cure"""
06-12-2019T03:54:32,SageSaga,i highly recommend giving it a shot
06-12-2019T03:55:26,Dadrobit,Where they were partnering with a children's hospital and Google or something to put these terminal kids inside projector cubes that were hooked up to a 360° camera out in the field doing their dream job so that the kids could come close to having that
06-12-2019T03:55:31,Dadrobit,Experience*
06-12-2019T03:56:08,Dadrobit,Fucking made me bawl damn near uncontrollably at work the first time I saw that.
06-12-2019T03:56:20,SageSaga,this is a very feel good anime
06-12-2019T03:57:19,Dadrobit,"Oof. I mean, still a maybe my dude. Gotta finish Breaking Bad first."
06-12-2019T03:57:38,Dadrobit,But I'll try to find the time to give it a watch.
06-12-2019T03:58:13,Dadrobit,Feel good animes are kinda iffy with me as well. Like that dragon pilot anime in Netflix.
06-12-2019T03:59:12,SageSaga,I thought watching 1080p anime on my new 4k tv (that i got cheap because- if i didnt i would be able to get one) would be a bad experience but- it's actually looking great
06-12-2019T03:59:28,SageSaga,the up-scaling tech has gotten waaaay better
06-12-2019T03:59:33,Dadrobit,"Got a ton of recommendations as ""such a great feel good anime"" and I couldn't get past like the fourth episode it was so... Empty."
06-12-2019T04:00:11,Xalrog,sometimes there is quite a border
06-12-2019T04:00:20,Xalrog,on the screen
06-12-2019T04:00:36,Dadrobit,"Like, it was cute and colorful, but. There was so little engagement for me."
06-12-2019T04:01:52,SageSaga,Dragon pilot was-- uhm- not a feel good anime imo
06-12-2019T04:02:19,Dadrobit,"Sorry, that's just what is was positioned as to me."
06-12-2019T04:02:46,Dadrobit,"Like, an overcoming your fears and going the distance kinda thing."
06-12-2019T04:04:22,SageSaga,until you find out it's just a weird vore thing with something saying lesbians arent real
06-12-2019T04:04:50,Dadrobit,"Yeah, the vore was very wtf off-putting."
06-12-2019T04:05:04,SageSaga,im done folks!

06-12-2019T10:19:51,tehbear,"Dragon Pilot, I remember that. First episode or two were interesting, then I lost interest"
06-12-2019T10:32:57,tehbear,for some reason Kaiji: The Ultimate Survivor comes to mind as the last complete and good anime I can recall watching.
06-12-2019T10:34:44,tehbear,"I dont really watch much anime, as most of them seem very derivative. Like someone already invented Generational Neural Nets 20 years ago and started churning out anime thats just a remix of other anime"
06-12-2019T10:35:01,tehbear,ai generated anime
06-12-2019T10:35:19,tehbear,but i think we still get 1 or 2 really good and watchable animes a year
06-12-2019T11:40:41,TeapotOfDoom,Skynet is real
06-12-2019T11:40:47,TeapotOfDoom,get to da choppa
06-12-2019T13:45:01,AspiringNoodle,"To be fair, if anything feels derivative its because art inspires art"
06-12-2019T13:45:32,AspiringNoodle,Look at classical paintings.  Some artists literally ripped off other artists.
06-12-2019T13:46:17,AspiringNoodle,I'm trying to remember the two paintings in question.  The one took the pose of a background character and copied it as one of the main subjects in the foreground of their work
06-12-2019T13:47:00,AspiringNoodle,Also all hail hat nation!

06-12-2019T17:21:57,SpazztasticKiwi,we’d all have to hang it on our fridges of course

06-12-2019T17:29:16,SageSaga,your chances of being banned with a default are much higher than if your have an avatar

06-12-2019T17:29:58,tehbear,a hat will save your chat
06-12-2019T17:29:59,AspiringNoodle,Is it because defaults are too easy to be considered bots?

06-12-2019T17:43:20,tehbear,:ctwokinds-zenshocked: no?
06-12-2019T17:43:36,SageSaga,no?
06-12-2019T17:43:38,SageSaga,oh
06-12-2019T17:43:40,SageSaga,wait yeah
06-12-2019T17:43:47,SageSaga,amd zen 3
06-12-2019T17:43:51,SageSaga,the 4k series
06-12-2019T17:43:53,TeapotOfDoom,yep that
06-12-2019T17:43:59,SageSaga,yeah i heard
06-12-2019T17:44:02,SageSaga,also - brb
06-12-2019T17:45:01,TeapotOfDoom,if rumors are to believed amd's gonna have 4 threads per core. which is amazing. i mean it's not unheard of (ibm's power cpus can do this) but unheard in the consumer space
06-12-2019T17:45:31,TeapotOfDoom,oh i forgot about our fluffy boi :ctwokinds-zenshocked:
06-12-2019T17:45:45,tehbear,when did HT become a thing? with the P4?
06-12-2019T17:45:46,TeapotOfDoom,yeah :ctwokinds-zenshocked: 3
06-12-2019T17:46:20,TeapotOfDoom,HP = hyperthreading?
06-12-2019T17:46:27,tehbear,yep
06-12-2019T17:46:53,TeapotOfDoom,i dunno much about the power cpus. a friend told me
06-12-2019T17:47:33,tehbear,so what will they call it? quadthreading?
06-12-2019T17:48:44,SageSaga,back- my mother is home- her thumb is bandaged up massively
06-12-2019T17:49:26,TeapotOfDoom,i mean the general term is Simultaneous multi threading or SMT. hyperthreading is an intel specific term for the same thing
06-12-2019T17:49:41,TeapotOfDoom,oh what happened?
06-12-2019T17:49:55,TeapotOfDoom,also smt was introduced on power 5
06-12-2019T17:50:58,tehbear,i remember when apple used those cpus
06-12-2019T17:50:58,SageSaga,shes making ham rolls for a party- so like 600 of them- and while cutting the rolls open- slit her thumb from top to bottom
06-12-2019T17:51:07,tehbear,ouch!
06-12-2019T17:51:38,TeapotOfDoom,uhhhhh
06-12-2019T17:51:53,TeapotOfDoom,i could still feel that on the other side of the globe
06-12-2019T17:52:04,tehbear,thankfully fingers are quite resilient
06-12-2019T17:52:40,SageSaga,one of her medications makes it so she keeps bleeding though
06-12-2019T17:53:02,TeapotOfDoom,oh i know that all to well
06-12-2019T17:53:04,TeapotOfDoom,that sucks
06-12-2019T17:53:37,TeapotOfDoom,as long as it's treated as fast as possible it's normally ok
