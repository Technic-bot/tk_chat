31-03-2019T00:02:33,Ordithus,vs http://cdn.twokinds.keenspot.com/comics/20190330.png

31-03-2019T00:03:11,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Raine goes from cute to cuter
31-03-2019T00:04:47,ThorburnCreative,true true. Never realised she lost the ear-tufts tho
31-03-2019T00:04:51,SpazztasticKiwi,"You know on ‚Äúcontact me‚Äù, your email has Twokinds but other places it says twokinds"
31-03-2019T00:05:08,SpazztasticKiwi,capitals matter
31-03-2019T00:05:22,DuskyTheHuskie,Ear Tufts are always cute no matter what has them.
31-03-2019T00:05:43,Ordithus,All the fluffy characters used to have em
31-03-2019T00:05:49,SpazztasticKiwi,And I don‚Äôt know what this is when I look at this new layout but my brain says egh
31-03-2019T00:05:55,DuskyTheHuskie,Fuzzy peeps gotta have the cute.
31-03-2019T00:06:41,ThorburnCreative,Just one of those little things you never notice seeing everything in sequence
31-03-2019T00:06:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Here‚Äôs an april fools idea: I got an assistant. Be on the lookout for stuff
31-03-2019T00:08:59,SpazztasticKiwi,that aside. I lend my positivite hyperactivity ‚ú® . Productivity go forth and prosper
31-03-2019T00:09:05,SpazztasticKiwi,All that jazz
31-03-2019T00:10:06,Dadrobit,"Ah man, this update has me nostalgic something fierce."
31-03-2019T00:10:28,MarvTheHugPharaoh,makes you feel old don't it
31-03-2019T00:11:35,DuskyTheHuskie,"I'm an old bish now, what do?"
31-03-2019T00:11:50,DuskyTheHuskie,Please don't tell me I gotta drink tea and read magazines all day now.
31-03-2019T00:13:22,Dadrobit,Dunno what it makes me feel. Just very fondly recall reading the crap outta this in high school. Just general good times back then.
31-03-2019T00:14:25,DuskyTheHuskie,"TK helped during highschool, gave me something to read a few hundred times before graduation. But even then, all I did after that was meet this butt. @MarvTheHugPharaoh"
31-03-2019T00:14:27,Dadrobit,Literally in high school. In the library. Alongside when I read Death Note.
31-03-2019T00:16:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Here‚Äôs a question from left field
31-03-2019T00:16:26,SpazztasticKiwi,What‚Äôs the lil red and white swirl thing on raman
31-03-2019T00:16:30,SpazztasticKiwi,ramen
31-03-2019T00:17:01,MarvTheHugPharaoh,fish cake
31-03-2019T00:17:13,DuskyTheHuskie,Fish cake?
31-03-2019T00:17:29,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Narutomaki
31-03-2019T00:17:32,DuskyTheHuskie,That just sounds like sushi but with extra steps.
31-03-2019T00:17:36,Dadrobit,"Yeah, it's basically fish puree. Think spam, but made of fish."
31-03-2019T00:18:07,Dadrobit,"They make strips of it, roll it up, and cut it into thin slices."
31-03-2019T00:21:11,DuskyTheHuskie,That just doesn't sound appealing.
31-03-2019T00:23:04,Dadrobit,"Ohhhhhh! Steve Blum just teamed up with one of the YT channels I watch to do an expose on making his newest VO demo. 28 minutes of content, be back in a half hour."
31-03-2019T00:23:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,have fun dad
31-03-2019T00:23:27,SpazztasticKiwi,I know what I wouldn‚Äôt be eating should I try real ramen
31-03-2019T00:23:27,Dadrobit,\o/
31-03-2019T00:24:19,Dadrobit,Mothafuckin Spike Spigal
31-03-2019T00:24:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I wonder if Tyler Ethan and Mark would do a cooking but based on cooking mama instructions
31-03-2019T00:24:31,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"What ever happens, happens"
31-03-2019T00:24:32,SpazztasticKiwi,They never measure stuff anyway

31-03-2019T18:57:12,Mippy,I actually haven‚Äôt run into too many jokes today. I was kind of waiting for Mark to start selling the official Markiplier jar of dirt...or something

31-03-2019T18:58:54,Bgrmystr2,but alas I survive.
