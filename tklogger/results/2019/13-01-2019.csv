13-01-2019T00:39:35,Ordithus,"Good idea, cut them into little bits.  More, smaller treats"
13-01-2019T00:42:34,unsteddyphoenix,new healthy snack for you pets: half a regular snack
13-01-2019T00:43:46,SpazztasticKiwi,He doesn‚Äôt chew anyway so there‚Äôs that
13-01-2019T00:43:59,SpazztasticKiwi,And apparently pizza bites call louder than noodles

13-01-2019T11:44:13,Mippy,Good morning Quill. :ctwokinds-katwet:
13-01-2019T11:44:21,Twokinds,I think I remember Bob Ross doing Palette knife paintings.
13-01-2019T11:45:04,Mippy,Yeah...he used his quite a bit :ctwokinds-floraquestion:
13-01-2019T11:45:21,CrimsonQuill,I think I saw a few of his programmes.
13-01-2019T11:45:28,Mippy,Mines no Bob Ross though XD
13-01-2019T11:45:47,CrimsonQuill,I've yet to see how my Subnautica fanart'll turn out when I colour it...
13-01-2019T11:45:58,CrimsonQuill,Then again I don't have paints.
13-01-2019T11:46:07,CrimsonQuill,I have colouring pencils.
13-01-2019T11:46:12,Mippy,Especially since the block of wood I have to use is the size of a postcard
13-01-2019T11:46:38,CrimsonQuill,What exactly is a pallete knife used for? :ctwokinds-floraquestion:
13-01-2019T11:46:59,Twokinds,Palleting
13-01-2019T11:47:11,Mippy,^ True
13-01-2019T11:47:14,CrimsonQuill,I'm afraid I didn't study art.
13-01-2019T11:47:20,CrimsonQuill,I studied Technical graphics.
13-01-2019T11:47:24,CrimsonQuill,The shame...
13-01-2019T11:47:30,Mippy,But also mixing and applying paint
13-01-2019T11:47:50,TerraTheWizard,https://www.twitch.tv/bobross
13-01-2019T11:48:17,CrimsonQuill,"Yes, I have definitely seen him paint."
13-01-2019T11:48:21,TerraTheWizard,"can't watch too much bob, he makes me sleepy"
13-01-2019T11:48:21,CrimsonQuill,He's cool.
13-01-2019T11:48:34,CrimsonQuill,He certainly has a very relaxing voice.
13-01-2019T11:48:47,CrimsonQuill,kind of like James May reading from an instruction book.
13-01-2019T11:49:00,Mippy,A man who dose not know Bob has never truly Zend :ctwokinds-zenshocked:
13-01-2019T11:49:41,Twokinds,I have no idea how he mixes colors
13-01-2019T11:49:52,Twokinds,Digital art has completely ruined me for physical media
13-01-2019T11:50:07,Twokinds,I'm so spoiled being able to just pick what color I want
13-01-2019T11:50:10,CrimsonQuill,"Hey, don't say that Tom! Your pencil sketches are awesome."
13-01-2019T11:50:23,CrimsonQuill,"And yes, they're not colour, but still."
13-01-2019T11:50:28,CrimsonQuill,My aim is to mix 'em up.
13-01-2019T11:50:38,CrimsonQuill,"I'll learn pencil first, then digital"
13-01-2019T11:50:56,iliar,For paper sketches not need to mix colors.
13-01-2019T11:52:15,Mippy,Here‚Äôs iliar with the deep stuff
13-01-2019T11:52:56,TerraTheWizard,my advice for pencil & paper is find a good eraser
13-01-2019T11:53:13,Ordithus,No pink erasers
13-01-2019T11:53:17,TerraTheWizard,a proper good one is a ctrl+z
13-01-2019T11:53:33,Ordithus,"I have a pretty nice eraser for hand drafting, because I'm old fashioned like that"
13-01-2019T11:53:45,TerraTheWizard,don't want one of those blocks of rubber that smudge everything
13-01-2019T11:53:48,Ordithus,"Cleans the pencil away, no smudges"
13-01-2019T11:54:21,CrimsonQuill,"I lost my good eraser, so I'm using an old football eraser for my outlines till I get another one."
13-01-2019T11:54:26,TerraTheWizard,i ruined my good eraser in school by writing notes on it using a fineliner
13-01-2019T11:54:27,TerraTheWizard,lol
13-01-2019T11:54:35,CrimsonQuill,Didn't we all
13-01-2019T11:54:55,CrimsonQuill,I had a really lovely Jumbo eraser from a visit to Portsmouth once...then I lost it.
13-01-2019T11:54:59,Ordithus,Teach doesn't check the eraser for notes :ptv-dealwithit:
13-01-2019T11:54:59,Mippy,I need to invest in an eraser...I used mine up last year
13-01-2019T11:55:30,TerraTheWizard,i got some of those friction erase pens
13-01-2019T11:55:43,TerraTheWizard,so i doodle with those instead of taking the notes i'm supposed to

13-01-2019T12:14:50,Ordithus,Melon has been pretty diverse lately

13-01-2019T12:16:12,CrimsonQuill,I think that some people can have favourite characters decuced form one sketch...
13-01-2019T12:16:48,iliar,Did you do all this by hand?
13-01-2019T12:17:00,Mippy,You‚Äôd probably have me for ‚Äúmost Basitins‚Äù if I had Nora Card
13-01-2019T12:17:30,TerraTheWizard,"thx for pointing that out, yeah, it's by hand so yeah"
13-01-2019T12:17:33,TerraTheWizard,i derp sometimes

13-01-2019T12:18:25,Mippy,Is attempting to fix painting
13-01-2019T12:18:31,TerraTheWizard,fully manual

13-01-2019T12:19:03,Ordithus,I'd love to have a searchable version of the Patreon page.
13-01-2019T12:19:09,iliar,I'm too lazy to do such things manually.
13-01-2019T12:19:21,Ordithus,What exists... silly Patreon and its horrid gallery format
13-01-2019T12:20:17,Ordithus,"I'm not sure how you'd get the names out of the sketches without doing that manually, iliar"
13-01-2019T12:20:23,Ordithus,At least manual scrubbing
13-01-2019T12:20:55,iliar,Many things can be automated.
13-01-2019T12:21:26,CrimsonQuill,I'm going to go-I'm talking to a friend from across the world on hangouts.
13-01-2019T12:21:29,CrimsonQuill,Cheerio

13-01-2019T12:22:48,Ordithus,"I suppose you could try to pull names between ""suggested by"" and a ""."" or ""!"""
13-01-2019T12:23:23,Ordithus,But then you get silly things like unsteddyphotographer or other nonsense :P
13-01-2019T12:24:28,Mippy,Don‚Äôt hire unsteddyphotographer...he may fall during a shoot
13-01-2019T12:24:59,iliar,"Technically yes. You can create a regular expression that will do this. But sometimes Tom forgets to add ""suggested by"" in to the description."
13-01-2019T12:25:55,Twokinds,I don't think I've forgotten
13-01-2019T12:26:07,Twokinds,"If I have, it's very rare."
13-01-2019T12:28:25,iliar,"On color art, you sometimes forget to add  ""suggested by"""
13-01-2019T12:28:37,Twokinds,That's true.
13-01-2019T12:29:06,Twokinds,Usually when it's a Nora Card and I forget to also include the original suggester.
13-01-2019T12:29:26,Twokinds,"But for sketches, I don't think I've ever forgotten."

13-01-2019T12:44:04,TerraTheWizard,"the colour credits drazgon & iliar, but the sketch only credits iliar"
13-01-2019T12:44:49,iliar,It's a long story how it happened.
13-01-2019T12:45:09,Mippy,*dusting ink on my big painting*
13-01-2019T12:47:45,Twokinds,That's because iliar asked me to add a second name only when I was coloring it.
13-01-2019T12:47:57,Twokinds,I didn't have the other name when I was sketching it.
13-01-2019T12:47:57,Azumachan,Howdy
13-01-2019T12:48:10,TerraTheWizard,ah
13-01-2019T12:48:13,Mippy,Not that long a story

13-01-2019T12:48:38,Azumachan,Hi Hi.
13-01-2019T12:48:45,Mippy,Gotta wash of some ink
13-01-2019T12:48:45,TerraTheWizard,i think that was the only sketch with a crediting discrepency
13-01-2019T12:49:27,TerraTheWizard,"but yeah, that was a pretty unique situation"

13-01-2019T13:01:23,CrimsonQuill,"Oh-kay, that just happende."
13-01-2019T13:01:49,CrimsonQuill,I make too many spelling mistakes.
13-01-2019T13:01:58,Twokinds,Man maybe I'm not as recovered as I thought
13-01-2019T13:02:31,CrimsonQuill,"What's happening, Tom?"
13-01-2019T13:02:38,Twokinds,"I was grocery shopping online and saw the ice cream and thought ""hey, don't leave the ice cream out like that, it'll melt."""
13-01-2019T13:03:01,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
13-01-2019T13:03:05,CrimsonQuill,That's true though. Ice cream shouldn't be left out.
13-01-2019T13:03:07,Twokinds,It's just a picture of an ice cream tub.
13-01-2019T13:03:12,CrimsonQuill,"Oh,"
13-01-2019T13:05:13,Mippy,:csagesaga-c1: Oh Tom
13-01-2019T13:05:53,Mippy,Reminds me of the time I put the milk back in the bathroom instead of the fridge
13-01-2019T13:11:17,Mippy,Decided I‚Äôm going to start watching Sheild Hero in between classes today. Ease myself back into my anime hobby
13-01-2019T13:11:31,CrimsonQuill,Cowboy Bebop is on my list.
13-01-2019T13:11:40,CrimsonQuill,"After that, Mobile Suit Gundam."
13-01-2019T13:11:46,CrimsonQuill,i just have to watch them.
13-01-2019T13:12:36,Mippy,"Well, I wanted something reasent and Sage seems to vouch for it. So I‚Äôll give it a go"
13-01-2019T13:13:48,Mippy,Can‚Äôt get any resenter than one episode
13-01-2019T13:24:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Poor Tom
13-01-2019T13:24:10,iliar,"Tom was right. A checked all patreon posts. For sketches he always add credits. But it's not always ""suggested by"". Sometimes it was ""Laruf asked for...""."
13-01-2019T13:24:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Well like Ord I gotta go do the work job thing
13-01-2019T13:25:04,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôll join a different conversation later ‚úåüèª
13-01-2019T14:24:44,Dadrobit,Taking a half day of work. Stopped by the college for a giggle.
13-01-2019T14:25:59,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-keith8D:
13-01-2019T14:25:59,Dadrobit,Turns out I might just be heading back to school. Discovered that I'm only two classes from getting an associates.
13-01-2019T14:26:02,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-florajiggle:
13-01-2019T14:26:14,TerraTheWizard,neat
13-01-2019T14:26:23,Dadrobit,So I htink I'm gonna take some stuffs in the fall semester.
13-01-2019T14:26:40,Dadrobit,And I really kinda want to go back to university to get a bachelors.
13-01-2019T14:27:28,Dadrobit,"I don't really have a use for it, but it does honestly bother me that I dropped out when I was 19 and never went back."
13-01-2019T14:29:07,Twokinds,That's cool
13-01-2019T14:29:23,Twokinds,Always nice to have the chance to finish what you started.
13-01-2019T14:31:07,Dadrobit,"Yeah. The associates should be easy. Only missing an oral communications credit, and a natural sciences credit."
13-01-2019T14:31:44,Dadrobit,"Oral communications is literally my living, so that should be nothing. Dunno what I'm gonna do for the sciences."
13-01-2019T14:32:59,Dadrobit,Official program degree will swap from certificate of competion in sound design and audio engineering to Associates in Audio Production Technologies
13-01-2019T14:37:42,Dadrobit,"""Introduction to Stars, Galaxies, and Cosmology"" sounds fun. We have our own planetarium on campus, and the classes will be partially held there."
13-01-2019T14:43:09,Dadrobit,"The bachelors will still take some serious time. ASU wants real live money for their programs, and I still need to be working while I'd be doing that..."
13-01-2019T14:45:28,Twokinds,I only have an associates
13-01-2019T14:45:52,Twokinds,That was enough for me.
13-01-2019T14:47:18,Dadrobit,"Yeah, honestly the certificate of course completion was enough for me to get into my field with some confidence."
13-01-2019T14:47:51,Dadrobit,"Getting a ""real"" degree is just kind of a ""I did it"" kinda thing ya know?"
13-01-2019T14:50:11,Twokinds,lol yeah
13-01-2019T14:56:19,Azumachan,Bachelors are grueling
13-01-2019T15:11:04,Dadrobit,I don't think it should be terrible. Gonna meet with an ASU advisor tomorrow afternoon to talk about possibilities going forward.
13-01-2019T15:11:59,Dadrobit,Already have maths up to Calculus which should cover most BA programs. Plus a fair number of other general studies classes from the community college.
13-01-2019T15:12:48,Dadrobit,"And I'm really only planning on one to two classes per semester. So yeah, it'll take a while, but workload should never be an issue."
13-01-2019T15:17:24,CrimsonQuill,"Well, the thing about Surveying is first you get the degree, THEN you have to do two years supervised work, and only THEN are you handed your badge as a chartered surveyor."
13-01-2019T15:25:09,SonOfGoku,"Its similar to going into Architectural Engineering. First get the bachelor's degree and take the FE exam, then after four years of supervised work take the PE exam in order to become certified."
13-01-2019T15:38:19,Dadrobit,"Only thing kinda like that in VO is getting into SAG AFTRA. To apply for a position in SAG, you have to take part in several SAG productions. To take part in a SAG production, you have to be a member of SAG. It's literally the most catch-22 thing ever."
13-01-2019T15:38:50,Dadrobit,The only way in essentially is to know somebody who knows somebody who can get your name on a list.
13-01-2019T16:33:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Just 30 minutes
13-01-2019T16:36:42,SpazztasticKiwi,And I liked online better myself. Don‚Äôt gotta wear pants
13-01-2019T16:47:30,CrimsonQuill,"Well, goodnight all."
