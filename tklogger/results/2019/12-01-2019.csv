12-01-2019T00:01:00,Bgrmystr2,"he doesn't always stay inside, and he does see people semi-often."
12-01-2019T00:01:08,Bgrmystr2,plus he's allergic to cats.
12-01-2019T00:01:11,Bgrmystr2,..and has a cat.
12-01-2019T00:05:56,TheBeckoner,like this comment if you are also sick
12-01-2019T00:06:01,TheBeckoner,wait...
12-01-2019T00:08:32,Bgrmystr2,I basically never get sick so.. :thinking:
12-01-2019T00:08:44,Bgrmystr2,:thumbsdown: ?
12-01-2019T00:09:03,Bgrmystr2,not sure if doing it right.
12-01-2019T00:17:11,SpazztasticKiwi,That family party really got him don with the sickness
12-01-2019T00:17:18,SpazztasticKiwi,down
12-01-2019T00:24:37,RimaDraws,lol
12-01-2019T00:31:50,TheBeckoner,I get sick periodically maybe every yearish

12-01-2019T10:56:26,TerraTheWizard,so a bunch of my friends were talking about how similar keith & trace look in tom's earlier art style
12-01-2019T10:56:30,TerraTheWizard,so i did a thing https://imgur.com/V3q5gF6

12-01-2019T11:01:05,TerraTheWizard,so that was supposed to be uploaded to my imgur account
12-01-2019T11:01:18,TerraTheWizard,but for some reason the login token dropped in the upload page
12-01-2019T11:01:26,TerraTheWizard,so i think that link went public
12-01-2019T11:01:30,TerraTheWizard,heck
12-01-2019T11:01:41,Xexanoth,"well, that's a thing"
12-01-2019T11:01:52,Xexanoth,good job with the swap though

12-01-2019T11:26:41,CrimsonQuill,Borderline addiction.
12-01-2019T11:27:12,TerraTheWizard,ehhhh
12-01-2019T11:27:37,CrimsonQuill,I'll take that as no one.
12-01-2019T11:27:44,CrimsonQuill,No one except me.
12-01-2019T11:27:47,CrimsonQuill,Ok.
12-01-2019T11:27:56,Ordithus,There's only like 3 of us here
12-01-2019T11:28:13,Ordithus,"So, I'm sure that's a fairly common thing"
12-01-2019T11:28:20,CrimsonQuill,Hmmm...
12-01-2019T11:28:25,Ordithus,Acquire responsibility :ctwokinds-keith8D:
12-01-2019T11:28:38,Ordithus,"Buy a house, you won't have as much time for internet"
12-01-2019T11:28:41,CrimsonQuill,I think that's my problem.
12-01-2019T11:28:58,CrimsonQuill,I'm still too reliant on having a person oversee me...
12-01-2019T11:29:05,CrimsonQuill,Tell me what to do...
12-01-2019T11:29:21,CrimsonQuill,Let's just say I have very poor initiative in anything work or study related.
12-01-2019T11:29:32,CrimsonQuill,And a tendency to faff around.
12-01-2019T11:29:52,Ordithus,Kinda the same if left to myself too much
12-01-2019T11:30:13,CrimsonQuill,Oh yeah-I don't really have anyone else with me.
12-01-2019T11:30:33,CrimsonQuill,I visit my family once a fortnight.
12-01-2019T11:30:37,CrimsonQuill,Other than that...
12-01-2019T11:30:42,CrimsonQuill,I'm very lonely.
12-01-2019T11:31:09,CrimsonQuill,"I feel no motivatio, no drive to do anything.."
12-01-2019T11:31:33,CrimsonQuill,I'm not even reading any of those books I brought up...or watching DVDs...
12-01-2019T11:31:34,Ordithus,"Hmm, hobbies?"
12-01-2019T11:31:45,CrimsonQuill,All consumed by the computer screen.
12-01-2019T11:31:52,CrimsonQuill,Except Video gaming
12-01-2019T11:32:06,CrimsonQuill,And even that is rapidly becoming just procrastination.
12-01-2019T11:32:13,CrimsonQuill,Putting off certain things...
12-01-2019T11:32:26,Ordithus,Like study?
12-01-2019T11:32:41,CrimsonQuill,Yeah.
12-01-2019T11:32:48,Ordithus,College?
12-01-2019T11:33:04,CrimsonQuill,More like work review.
12-01-2019T11:33:13,Ordithus,Sure
12-01-2019T11:33:13,CrimsonQuill,Engineering Surveying work
12-01-2019T11:33:24,CrimsonQuill,I just have a problem...
12-01-2019T11:33:35,Ordithus,"Oh yeah, you seemed pretty excited about that a while ago"
12-01-2019T11:33:39,CrimsonQuill,And I'm too afraid and too lazy to deal with it.
12-01-2019T11:34:00,CrimsonQuill,I feel like I need someone to tell me what to do.
12-01-2019T11:34:17,CrimsonQuill,"I know that the world can't work that way, but I still feel like it."
12-01-2019T11:35:20,CrimsonQuill,"I also have an obsession with the symbolism of a 'clean slate start', as in, waiting till a certain time before starting over completely, rather than fixing problems as they crop up on the fly."
12-01-2019T11:35:25,CrimsonQuill,Like my bad habits....
12-01-2019T11:35:33,Ordithus,"Yeah, self-motivation isn't easy and doesn't just come to everyone in spades."
12-01-2019T11:36:10,Ordithus,I don't think there's anything unique about what you're feeling.
12-01-2019T11:36:12,CrimsonQuill,"I'm terrified of myself. But I don't want to change either, because I'm terrified that it'd be too much effort, and that I'd make the wrong decisions."
12-01-2019T11:36:25,CrimsonQuill,"Plus, I keep beating myself up over every tiny thing."
12-01-2019T11:36:28,CrimsonQuill,And the big ones.
12-01-2019T11:36:42,CrimsonQuill,This entire conversation is just a case in point.
12-01-2019T11:36:54,CrimsonQuill,There will be a reckoning....
12-01-2019T11:37:20,Ordithus,Hmm... I understand what you're getting at.
12-01-2019T11:37:27,Ordithus,Help is whole other thing
12-01-2019T11:37:55,CrimsonQuill,"Well, my parents and I have agreed I'm going to see a therapist."
12-01-2019T11:38:04,Ordithus,That could be a start
12-01-2019T11:38:54,CrimsonQuill,I keep looking at the week ahead with dread...
12-01-2019T11:38:58,CrimsonQuill,Three exams.
12-01-2019T11:39:13,CrimsonQuill,"Exams, all my life, have been a major Achilles Heel for me."
12-01-2019T11:39:27,CrimsonQuill,And then a week off.
12-01-2019T11:39:34,Ordithus,Ooh
12-01-2019T11:39:58,CrimsonQuill,I suppose all I'm doing now is looking for more distractions from reality till the stream comes...
12-01-2019T11:41:11,Ordithus,"Any advice I try to give you isn't some magic, I don't really know any better or anything"
12-01-2019T11:41:17,CrimsonQuill,I know.
12-01-2019T11:41:22,Ordithus,"But, for me, family, friends, exercise..."
12-01-2019T11:41:25,Ordithus,Those can help
12-01-2019T11:41:47,Ordithus,"Finding something productive to do, even if it's not much"
12-01-2019T11:42:11,CrimsonQuill,I just need to motivate myself...
12-01-2019T11:42:14,Ordithus,"Like patching some holes in a wall, and finding out the paint doesn't match"
12-01-2019T11:42:44,CrimsonQuill,Was that what you said you'd burn the house down over? :ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
12-01-2019T11:42:53,CrimsonQuill,"But yeah, I see the point."
12-01-2019T11:43:05,CrimsonQuill,"Believe me, I've actually looked it up before."
12-01-2019T11:43:14,CrimsonQuill,And my Dad's said similar things...
12-01-2019T11:43:34,CrimsonQuill,I've found the root of my problem.
12-01-2019T11:43:41,Ordithus,"Might not get better today, doesn't have to.  Wanting to make things better is at least something, I feel"
12-01-2019T11:43:59,CrimsonQuill,Wanting to make things better is something...
12-01-2019T11:44:13,CrimsonQuill,But I've also identified the root of my problem.
12-01-2019T11:44:20,Ordithus,Yeah?
12-01-2019T11:44:31,CrimsonQuill,And that problem is what every procrastinator ever says some time or other.
12-01-2019T11:44:37,CrimsonQuill,"""I'll do it later"""
12-01-2019T11:44:41,Ordithus,Haha
12-01-2019T11:44:44,CrimsonQuill,That's my main problem.
12-01-2019T11:45:18,CrimsonQuill,"So what I'm going to do, RIGHT NOW-and that is upon my word, which I take seriously-is open up some notes, and study them."
12-01-2019T11:45:37,Ordithus,Go for it!  And good luck on your exams
12-01-2019T11:45:38,CrimsonQuill,"I'll take a peek on this chat every little bit, but expect some gaps in the stuff."
12-01-2019T11:45:45,CrimsonQuill,Thanks mate :ctwokinds-rainehappy:
12-01-2019T11:46:01,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-katdryer:
12-01-2019T11:46:21,CrimsonQuill,"BTW, who's your favourite Discworld Character?"
12-01-2019T11:46:39,Ordithus,A favorite?  I've never considered that
12-01-2019T11:47:05,Ordithus,"Um, Susan, probably?"
12-01-2019T11:47:48,Ordithus,Vimes too
12-01-2019T11:50:29,CrimsonQuill,Tug-of-war for top spot between a dozen characters
12-01-2019T11:52:49,CrimsonQuill,"Vimes, Carrot, Granny Weatherwax and Death are big contenders"
12-01-2019T11:53:12,Ordithus,All good.
12-01-2019T11:56:18,CrimsonQuill,Finished THUD! a week ago
12-01-2019T11:56:32,CrimsonQuill,Cyclic error cyclic error cyclic error...
12-01-2019T11:56:42,CrimsonQuill,EDM...Gallium Arsendide Diode...
12-01-2019T11:57:04,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-zenshocked:
12-01-2019T11:58:04,CrimsonQuill,"Sorry, just typing them to remember"
12-01-2019T11:58:11,CrimsonQuill,Reading up EDM reading errors
12-01-2019T11:58:16,CrimsonQuill,Like constant error
12-01-2019T11:58:33,CrimsonQuill,Occurs where constant point is misaligned with tripod centre point
12-01-2019T11:58:54,CrimsonQuill,"I'd forgotten that for ages, now I know it again."
12-01-2019T11:58:56,Ordithus,What is EDM?
12-01-2019T11:59:16,CrimsonQuill,Electronic Distance Measurement
12-01-2019T11:59:21,CrimsonQuill,Used in Surveying
12-01-2019T11:59:22,Ordithus,I thought you meant Electronic Dance Music lol
12-01-2019T11:59:34,Ordithus,Now it makes some sense
12-01-2019T11:59:35,CrimsonQuill,"Electronic levels, Electronic total stations etc."
12-01-2019T12:00:08,CrimsonQuill,They use a variable wavelength laser beam from a Gallium Arsenide Diode to measure distance.
12-01-2019T12:00:15,CrimsonQuill,Which is tricky...
12-01-2019T12:00:28,CrimsonQuill,one source of error is that clocks have to be synced exactly.
12-01-2019T12:00:35,Ordithus,How those instruments work is literal lasers and math
12-01-2019T12:00:41,CrimsonQuill,Yep
12-01-2019T12:00:43,Ordithus,Basically black magic

12-01-2019T12:01:10,CrimsonQuill,Not when you're carrying £5'000 worth of equipment in a box
12-01-2019T12:01:16,CrimsonQuill,"Ooh, hullo Reni"
12-01-2019T12:01:30,CrimsonQuill,"Anyhow, there are three main error sources to worry about"
12-01-2019T12:01:37,CrimsonQuill,Constant Error I already said
12-01-2019T12:01:56,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-reniderp:
12-01-2019T12:01:58,CrimsonQuill,"Cyclic error is an error repeated through the wavelength, not distance dependent"
12-01-2019T12:02:32,CrimsonQuill,Scale error is distance dependent-arises from an incorrect modulation
12-01-2019T12:02:36,CrimsonQuill,Which is basically:
12-01-2019T12:03:18,CrimsonQuill,You measure 1654m but only use a 10m amplitude modulation
12-01-2019T12:03:26,CrimsonQuill,You only see the last 4m
12-01-2019T12:03:42,CrimsonQuill,You have to use a 10'000m Amplitude Modulation to get the full thing
12-01-2019T12:03:47,Ordithus,Huh.
12-01-2019T12:03:52,CrimsonQuill,Sorry about the walls of text.
12-01-2019T12:04:16,CrimsonQuill,But that's actually a major section of the exam studied for.
12-01-2019T12:04:37,CrimsonQuill,I'll probably be asked to explain those sorts of errors and suchlike.
12-01-2019T12:04:48,Ordithus,That's pretty specific info.
12-01-2019T12:05:29,CrimsonQuill,"Oh yeah-surveying instruments can also be affected by electromagnetic radiation, refraction, atmospheric factors (such as humidity) and suchlike."
12-01-2019T12:06:02,Ordithus,Also user error
12-01-2019T12:06:05,Ordithus,Always user error
12-01-2019T12:06:27,CrimsonQuill,Errors are everywhere.
12-01-2019T12:06:47,CrimsonQuill,There is no such thing as 100% accuracy here.
12-01-2019T12:06:57,CrimsonQuill,There are bound to be tiny erros that slip through.
12-01-2019T12:07:08,CrimsonQuill,The job is to make sure that they are as tiny as possible.
12-01-2019T12:07:29,Ordithus,"My mentor when I started engineering loved to say ""Good enough"""
12-01-2019T12:07:32,CrimsonQuill,Because a 5mm error in the plans for building a bridge can be an absolute catastrophe.
12-01-2019T12:07:43,CrimsonQuill,There is no 'good enough'.
12-01-2019T12:07:54,CrimsonQuill,Our mantra is 'Redundancy'.
12-01-2019T12:08:03,CrimsonQuill,And that's something I need to hit myself on the head with.
12-01-2019T12:10:02,Ordithus,"Maybe a difference between measurement and design.  Measurements always should be as good as reasonable (certainly small enough error to do the job).  Design can always be better, but if it meets the requirements, eventually, it's good enough."
12-01-2019T12:10:35,CrimsonQuill,"Heh, that is true."
12-01-2019T12:10:47,Ordithus,"You have requirements in surveying, which you have to meet."
12-01-2019T12:11:07,CrimsonQuill,"My mentors say that on a bridge building site, a pillar might constantly be warping either direction by a fraction."
12-01-2019T12:11:24,CrimsonQuill,"As a result, they are always watching with the total station."
12-01-2019T12:11:30,CrimsonQuill,Checking for errors...
12-01-2019T12:11:38,Ordithus,Oh they will be.  The design better account for that imperfection
12-01-2019T12:11:49,CrimsonQuill,And instructing the workers to make adjustments as they go.
12-01-2019T12:12:25,CrimsonQuill,There are also 3 laser EDMs which use three lasers of varying wavelengths to cancel out errors in each particular length.
12-01-2019T12:13:06,CrimsonQuill,Also...Ordithus...opinion question.
12-01-2019T12:13:15,CrimsonQuill,Which did you prefer as my avatar...
12-01-2019T12:13:22,CrimsonQuill,The quill i have now...
12-01-2019T12:13:28,CrimsonQuill,Or the oicture of the cat?
12-01-2019T12:13:40,CrimsonQuill,Because I'm considering going back to the cat...
12-01-2019T12:13:56,Ordithus,"I don't remember the cat, but KITTY :ctwokinds-maddiessparkles:"
12-01-2019T12:14:02,CrimsonQuill,Yah
12-01-2019T12:14:09,CrimsonQuill,She's my aunt's cat
12-01-2019T12:14:11,CrimsonQuill,One of them.
12-01-2019T12:14:15,CrimsonQuill,Her name is Willow.
12-01-2019T12:14:28,CrimsonQuill,And she just LOVES to come for a cuddle...
12-01-2019T12:14:44,CrimsonQuill,"She know's which people are likely to let her in, and waits till it happens."
12-01-2019T12:14:48,CrimsonQuill,And she's a good mouser.
12-01-2019T12:14:58,CrimsonQuill,They all are...
12-01-2019T12:18:38,Ordithus,I will get a cat. Eventually.

12-01-2019T16:39:51,MviluUatusun,I kind of figured.  I can't imagine Raine as a mechanic.

12-01-2019T16:40:01,CrimsonQuill,"@CatzArt ""Thanks for the Tank. HE never gets me anything."""
12-01-2019T16:40:15,CrRAR,Hehehe
12-01-2019T16:40:16,Ordithus,Raine's more of a drill sergeant

12-01-2019T16:41:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Flora could be a pin up army nurse
12-01-2019T16:41:23,CrimsonQuill,@MviluUatusun which one?
12-01-2019T16:41:24,unsteddyphoenix,"So, Clovis I gues"

12-01-2019T16:43:44,Rrolf,from the general size and turret shape...
12-01-2019T16:43:47,CatzArt,yes fo mo lets go with that. Nibbly can be the bird
12-01-2019T16:43:48,CrimsonQuill,I have no idea what it is
12-01-2019T16:44:02,BluePhantom90,looks like a Sherman
12-01-2019T16:44:02,CatzArt,that tank looks like a t-44
12-01-2019T16:44:03,ThingsAreMoving,We all know that the true warriors of WW2 were disabled women.
12-01-2019T16:44:03,ProfessionalLurker,might be an M24
12-01-2019T16:44:13,Rrolf,Sherman was much taller

12-01-2019T16:44:25,Rrolf,the Soviet MBTs are tiny in genera;
12-01-2019T16:44:26,CatzArt,Russians were fond of tanks with a turret in the back
12-01-2019T16:44:42,CrimsonQuill,It could be a Churchill
12-01-2019T16:44:48,CrimsonQuill,But that had a flatter turret

12-01-2019T19:26:20,CrRAR,Lol foamy is one way to describe it.
12-01-2019T19:26:24,CrimsonQuill,I'm not sure RAM matters if you have a poor WIFI signal.
12-01-2019T19:26:28,unsteddyphoenix,holy

12-01-2019T19:26:59,BadFoMo,I think I may have called it!

12-01-2019T19:28:05,Ordithus,"Neon, your Nibs tempo is off"

12-01-2019T19:28:40,CrimsonQuill,This sketch looks interesting.
12-01-2019T19:28:42,NeonMitsumi,Heck
12-01-2019T19:28:52,NeonMitsumi,@Ordithus How does one fix
12-01-2019T19:28:59,WereKeidran,"definetly Natani, but who's that?"
12-01-2019T19:29:02,ThingsAreMoving,apply sedative
12-01-2019T19:29:17,ThingsAreMoving,"Were, that's obviously Carver"
12-01-2019T19:29:17,CrimsonQuill,"@WereKeidran not Natani, Raine,"
12-01-2019T19:29:20,Dadrobit,And tabs in Firefox are nice. They stay large enough to read no matter how many you have open. Where Chrome squishes them into nothing.
12-01-2019T19:29:25,MuonNeutrino,raine and... a female wolf with cheekfloof that also points upwards
12-01-2019T19:29:34,TerraTheWizard,"oh, is it the frankenkeidren one"
12-01-2019T19:29:34,MuonNeutrino,"rose would fit, but raine's expression is a bit off"

12-01-2019T19:29:48,CatzArt,its her parents maybe ?
12-01-2019T19:30:01,CrimsonQuill,I think Dadrobit's book club might just be realied.

12-01-2019T19:30:09,MuonNeutrino,yeah raine's expression is a bit odd if this were raine and rose

12-01-2019T20:22:44,NeonMitsumi,Can confirm.
12-01-2019T20:22:51,CatzArt,One of my favorite things about sneps is that their mating habits are weird as when the female calls for a male. they hang out togther for a few hours before doing anything. Its cute

12-01-2019T20:52:51,Bgrmystr2,rather than more animal-like
12-01-2019T20:52:57,Bgrmystr2,so I'd say 2 legs and 2 arms
12-01-2019T20:53:05,SpazztasticKiwi,If we wannabe technical. She can use her hands like legs better than humans
12-01-2019T20:53:07,Bgrmystr2,"as an adult, anyway"
12-01-2019T20:53:16,MrEase,yeah thats the point of what unsteddy is saying
12-01-2019T20:53:23,Ordithus,And as long as no one sticks the collar on her
12-01-2019T20:53:37,Bgrmystr2,"but when they're young, definitely four legs"
12-01-2019T20:53:55,SpazztasticKiwi,"In any case, what’s y’all think of Maddie and Mauve selling cookies for a fundraiser for the tavern kind of idea"
12-01-2019T20:54:11,SpazztasticKiwi,I tried it this round
12-01-2019T20:54:19,Ordithus,Sounds cute
12-01-2019T20:54:30,RimaDraws,four legs what
12-01-2019T20:54:36,unsteddyphoenix,To summarise: https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/177/587/0ef.jpg
12-01-2019T20:54:44,TorqueEmUp,Well kinda disappointed my suggestion didn't appear for voting this week. Guess it was a forbidden suggestion. :P
12-01-2019T20:54:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Very cute. Mauve gives the big eyes while Maddie sneaks around and grabs stuff
12-01-2019T20:55:02,Ordithus,Did you win something last week?
12-01-2019T20:55:03,unsteddyphoenix,It sounds cute
12-01-2019T20:55:10,RimaDraws,no neither he nor i did
12-01-2019T20:55:30,TorqueEmUp,"Nope, I've been running the Krystal suggestion for a while, got tired of it being nearly dead last, so I went with a Keidran Nibbly one this week."
12-01-2019T20:55:39,Bgrmystr2,lol Rima did you ever see tom draw keidran when they're young? They're just like animals are here for us
12-01-2019T20:55:40,unsteddyphoenix,"""What do I do maddie?"" ""Nothing just...think about sad things, and the money will come rolling in"""
12-01-2019T20:55:41,Ordithus,Male Keidran Nibbly?
12-01-2019T20:55:44,TorqueEmUp,Nope
12-01-2019T20:55:47,Ordithus,Ah
12-01-2019T20:55:54,Ordithus,"Don't remember seeing it, so dunno"
12-01-2019T20:56:09,RimaDraws,no probably didnt....
12-01-2019T20:56:14,RimaDraws,i probably wasnt around then
12-01-2019T20:56:15,TorqueEmUp,"Nah I searched the results pages to make sure I didn't miss it by mistake, didn't see it."
12-01-2019T20:56:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe veto?
12-01-2019T20:56:45,unsteddyphoenix,"was it spoilers or lewd, you think"
12-01-2019T20:56:56,Bgrmystr2,"yeah tom's drawn young keidran before, and they're just like young animals with 4 legs, similar body structure"
12-01-2019T20:57:04,Bgrmystr2,and as they get older they turn into what you see
12-01-2019T20:57:10,unsteddyphoenix,He did last week lol
12-01-2019T20:57:12,Bgrmystr2,there's a whole maeve chart
12-01-2019T20:57:21,Bgrmystr2,I dunno where it'd be though
12-01-2019T20:57:22,RimaDraws,well ive seen some stuff but wasnt here when it was originaly drawn
12-01-2019T20:57:23,RimaDraws,wasnt a fan then
12-01-2019T20:57:33,TorqueEmUp,"Guessing, possibly either spoiler for Magical Mishaps, or maybe too out of character? But honestly Nibbly has got up in Sythe's business before in pics Tom has done."
12-01-2019T20:57:37,Bgrmystr2,ah hold up here we go https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/316051421105618944/354705483572969502/Maeve_Age.png
12-01-2019T20:58:35,Bgrmystr2,"I'd say by age 3, it'd change from four legs to two legs and two arms. There's a transition period we just don't have cuz nothing IRL does that. That I know of anyway"
12-01-2019T20:59:07,TorqueEmUp,That's got to be a weird transition period where your limbs start to move from quadruped to bipedal.
12-01-2019T20:59:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Puberty
12-01-2019T20:59:21,unsteddyphoenix,"true, have to relearn to walk"
12-01-2019T20:59:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Sucks for all
12-01-2019T20:59:26,Xexanoth,wasn't there a mnibbly keidran suggestion in one of the first polls?
12-01-2019T20:59:32,Ordithus,"Humans kinda do it, sort of.  Just way less aware"
12-01-2019T20:59:33,Bgrmystr2,keidran nibbly has already been done before
12-01-2019T20:59:33,unsteddyphoenix,yeah there waws
12-01-2019T20:59:42,Xexanoth,tom might have combined them
12-01-2019T20:59:50,TorqueEmUp,Nope
12-01-2019T21:00:09,RimaDraws,nooo
12-01-2019T21:00:11,Bgrmystr2,"It had sythe going ""I don't know how to feel about this"""
12-01-2019T21:00:12,TorqueEmUp,And Honestly that's a poor excuse bgr. :P
12-01-2019T21:00:23,Bgrmystr2,what's an excuse? lol
12-01-2019T21:00:28,SpazztasticKiwi,May have to tweak it a bit and retry or ask Tom bout it
12-01-2019T21:00:34,TorqueEmUp,That she has already been done before
12-01-2019T21:00:37,Bgrmystr2,"you said it wasn't done before, I'm saying it was. :thinking:"
12-01-2019T21:00:45,Bgrmystr2,I'm not excusing anything. Just making a note.
12-01-2019T21:00:46,unsteddyphoenix,there was def a male nibbly in there
12-01-2019T21:01:02,TorqueEmUp,That wasn't mine though
12-01-2019T21:01:08,Bgrmystr2,but it existed.
12-01-2019T21:01:11,unsteddyphoenix,"hey, unlucky"
12-01-2019T21:01:52,TorqueEmUp,"Yeah, yet we got unnamed researcher chick, multiple times now."
12-01-2019T21:02:03,TorqueEmUp,:P
12-01-2019T21:02:08,Xexanoth,we also had anthro nibbly mutliple times already
12-01-2019T21:02:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Seems sketches go through phases
12-01-2019T21:02:20,Xexanoth,"so the ""it was done before"" is not really an argument"
12-01-2019T21:02:22,TorqueEmUp,"Indeed, so where is this argument going?"
12-01-2019T21:02:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Neverland
12-01-2019T21:02:29,Twokinds,Uh... oh right
12-01-2019T21:02:38,TorqueEmUp,lol
12-01-2019T21:02:42,Twokinds,"Yours was cut because... uh... well, you'll find out this week."
12-01-2019T21:02:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Ay again Tom

12-01-2019T21:03:05,Ordithus,Telling us it's a spoiler is a spoiler
12-01-2019T21:03:10,TorqueEmUp,"Also I won't mention it hear, as to not spoil it."
12-01-2019T21:03:11,SpazztasticKiwi,So it was veto

12-01-2019T21:17:02,unsteddyphoenix,Really? Surely there must be some sort of no items node
12-01-2019T21:17:50,FenceEqualizer,"Because Nintendo is awesome, they choose between my ruleset or the other players ruleset. Some people like to cause absolute misery and do 3 stock 7 min matches with special flag as sonic"

12-01-2019T21:18:23,unsteddyphoenix,Thats so rude
12-01-2019T21:18:25,FenceEqualizer,I didn't stand a chance with inceneroar slow behind XD
12-01-2019T21:19:56,FenceEqualizer,Incineroar rather
12-01-2019T21:20:11,unsteddyphoenix,If he had FOUR legs he'd be faster
12-01-2019T21:20:12,unsteddyphoenix,But nooooo~
12-01-2019T21:20:48,FenceEqualizer,But then how could he deliver sweet suplexs to his enemies!?
12-01-2019T21:21:10,unsteddyphoenix,Thats what bowser's for~
12-01-2019T21:22:24,FenceEqualizer,Bowser doesn't suplex he just sits/lays on people's.
12-01-2019T21:22:45,Twokinds,Bowser is one of my favorites
12-01-2019T21:22:51,Twokinds,Of my random roster
12-01-2019T21:23:06,SpazztasticKiwi,So you DO have a main
12-01-2019T21:23:44,SpazztasticKiwi,I got a feelin I’d either be really bad at smash or meh
12-01-2019T21:23:54,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
12-01-2019T21:23:56,FenceEqualizer,Tom mains the random button
12-01-2019T21:24:02,unsteddyphoenix,Sometimes he jumps and lays down on people!
12-01-2019T21:24:33,SpazztasticKiwi,You’re thinking of snorlax
12-01-2019T21:25:04,FenceEqualizer,Nah full on bowser in smash who is somehow faster then incineroar!
12-01-2019T21:25:05,Xexanoth,you can be bad at smash and still have a main
12-01-2019T21:25:07,Xexanoth,like me
12-01-2019T21:25:50,unsteddyphoenix,Bruh bowser can zoom
12-01-2019T21:25:56,unsteddyphoenix,Noone expects it

12-01-2019T21:30:23,unsteddyphoenix,That is a quirky main
12-01-2019T21:30:24,MrEase,I fell in love with the way he plays in smash 4 and he got so much better
12-01-2019T21:30:42,MrEase,because they turned the side-b into an actual functioning move
12-01-2019T21:31:00,MrEase,thank you ultimate
12-01-2019T21:31:19,Xexanoth,meanwhile as palutena they took my projhectile reflecting wall away
12-01-2019T21:31:28,unsteddyphoenix,"Same kinda. Mained lil' mac, and then new smash made him so much better"
12-01-2019T21:31:34,FenceEqualizer,It's still there Xex
12-01-2019T21:31:37,FenceEqualizer,As a counter
12-01-2019T21:31:53,Ordithus,"Never mained anyone in smash, but I don't play it much.  Want to play more"
12-01-2019T21:31:56,unsteddyphoenix,'cause he doesnt instakill himself with one of his moves
12-01-2019T21:31:56,Xexanoth,"yeah, but it has a much smaller time window and you can't block/push people with it"
12-01-2019T21:32:12,FenceEqualizer,That is true
12-01-2019T21:32:34,Xexanoth,there was just something very satisfying about killing someone with their own projectile when there was this nice wall there
12-01-2019T21:33:28,MrEase,yeah but considering how good palutena got its a fair trade
12-01-2019T21:33:35,Xexanoth,yeah
12-01-2019T21:33:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Robo friend

12-01-2019T21:34:03,MrEase,"then again I've been complaining about how they changed Zelda's down tilt and other moves, when they fixed all the things that made her bad, its a fair trade but one that I can't adapt to"
12-01-2019T21:34:09,MrEase,I had to drop her :(
12-01-2019T21:34:23,Xexanoth,"then again, i only play it when i'm at a friends place against people who play it a ton, so it's not like having a ""good"" character really matters to me"
12-01-2019T21:34:41,Ordithus,Same
12-01-2019T21:34:44,MrEase,"plus the game is a little over a month old, theres no defined best character"
12-01-2019T21:34:46,Xexanoth,"my goal is always ""don't die first"""

12-01-2019T21:37:12,FenceEqualizer,Like competitive games with friends and co workers
12-01-2019T21:37:16,MrEase,"inb4 ""smash isn't a fighting game"" comments"

12-01-2019T21:37:35,unsteddyphoenix,"What is it, an action adventure?"
12-01-2019T21:37:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t play many games at all. No way to
12-01-2019T21:37:43,Bgrmystr2,it's a 3rd person 3d fighting game.
12-01-2019T21:37:46,Bgrmystr2,wtf else is it?

12-01-2019T21:37:57,Xexanoth,"i like competetive games, the problem is that i don't use controllers or play smash outside of being at a frineds place, so i can'T keep up with anyone"

12-01-2019T21:38:01,MrEase,it was a running gag back when the FGC was trying to keep smash out of fighting game events
12-01-2019T21:38:03,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s what it is
12-01-2019T21:38:06,FenceEqualizer,A platformer game or a party game
12-01-2019T21:38:08,Xexanoth,or any fighting games really
12-01-2019T21:38:20,MrEase,"""its a party game, it doesn't belong with the REAL fighting games"""
12-01-2019T21:38:27,FenceEqualizer,Most say it as a joke though some really don't like acknowledging smash as a fighter
12-01-2019T21:38:28,MrEase,that didn't last long lol
12-01-2019T21:39:03,unsteddyphoenix,platformer lol
12-01-2019T21:39:04,Bgrmystr2,"Lol, it's not like it's an incorrect statement. It is a party game. It's not made to be competitive like other fighters"
12-01-2019T21:39:07,unsteddyphoenix,I like that one
12-01-2019T21:39:28,Bgrmystr2,but it's a party fighter
12-01-2019T21:39:31,unsteddyphoenix,It...is though? There are totally smash tournaments and serious balancing n shit
12-01-2019T21:39:34,FenceEqualizer,It's getting more and more catered to competitive
12-01-2019T21:39:41,MrEase,"yeah, its the community that made it competitive, though to be fair, this one had testers from the competitive smash community"
12-01-2019T21:39:47,FenceEqualizer,Though best believe Sakurai fought against it
12-01-2019T21:39:49,MrEase,so they are listening
12-01-2019T21:40:04,Bgrmystr2,the game itself is not made to be balanced. people have to go in and disable so much of the game to make it so
12-01-2019T21:40:19,unsteddyphoenix,"Lol, well thats not untrue"
12-01-2019T21:40:22,Bgrmystr2,"remove a bunch of characters, items, stages, etc"
12-01-2019T21:40:47,FenceEqualizer,Characters weren't removed much. Not from a lack of trying
12-01-2019T21:40:47,Bgrmystr2,"it can BE competitive, absolutely, but it wasn't made for it, was never it's purpose"
12-01-2019T21:40:50,MrEase,"well, I mean items are inherently unbalanced, and stages give huge advantages to faster characters unless they're simple and small"
12-01-2019T21:41:12,MrEase,"No characters were removed, with the exception of meta knight and that was only for like a month and he was unbanned"
12-01-2019T21:41:45,FenceEqualizer,Metaknight was the only character that was legit banned in singles
12-01-2019T21:41:55,MrEase,and that was very shortly lived
12-01-2019T21:42:10,Xexanoth,"same happened to bayonetta, when she cam out she was banned from tournaments for a 2 months or so"
12-01-2019T21:42:12,FenceEqualizer,Cloud was banned from doubles
12-01-2019T21:42:26,MrEase,no she wasn't
12-01-2019T21:42:35,MrEase,only in Spain
12-01-2019T21:42:48,Xexanoth,and spain doesn't count?
12-01-2019T21:42:59,MrEase,"I mean thats fair, but it wasn't agreed on by the community"
12-01-2019T21:43:22,MrEase,if it was a community wide accepted ruleset then yeah it would count
12-01-2019T21:43:31,MrEase,like stage lists/time ect
12-01-2019T21:44:11,unsteddyphoenix,spains not a real country psh
12-01-2019T21:46:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Then neither is New Zealand
12-01-2019T21:46:39,Xexanoth,afaik spain was the only community having tournaments during that time period. thewhole reason for the ban was that people didn't have enough time to train against her moveset anyways
12-01-2019T21:46:50,Xexanoth,since she had just come out
12-01-2019T21:47:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I just pulled my covers up and a disgruntled mew came out of them
12-01-2019T21:47:09,unsteddyphoenix,oi
12-01-2019T21:47:14,MrEase,oh no thats not what I was referring to
12-01-2019T21:47:14,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-floAAA:
12-01-2019T21:47:16,SpazztasticKiwi,I covered Bagheera. He did not approve
12-01-2019T21:47:25,unsteddyphoenix,Then where do hobbits come from checkmate
12-01-2019T21:47:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Better places
12-01-2019T21:48:04,unsteddyphoenix,Harsh but fair
12-01-2019T21:48:55,SpazztasticKiwi,But don’t worry. You can be a hobbit. Follow your dreams
12-01-2019T21:54:57,Bgrmystr2,but there's already a hobbit in the chat
12-01-2019T21:55:30,Bgrmystr2,"he isn't here atm, but yknow, he was here earlier"
12-01-2019T21:55:36,Xexanoth,don't hobbits always come in two?
12-01-2019T21:55:57,Xexanoth,"sam and frodo, mary and pippin, smeagul and the guy he killed for the ring...."
12-01-2019T21:56:14,Ordithus,Bilbo was a lonely hobbit
12-01-2019T21:56:27,Bgrmystr2,uhh.. there's prolly just individual hobbits that like to pair up?
12-01-2019T21:56:36,Bgrmystr2,I doubt they come naturally in pairs.
12-01-2019T21:56:38,Bgrmystr2,that'd be weird.
12-01-2019T21:57:26,Ordithus,"Always two, there are, master and apprentice"
12-01-2019T21:57:30,Ordithus,"Oh wait, that's Sith"
12-01-2019T22:04:44,Bgrmystr2,xD
