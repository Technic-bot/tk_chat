18-10-2019T01:55:28,Dadrobit,I am suuuuuper tired man. Had a company meeting at HQ today. Had to stay even longer for leadership seminar.
18-10-2019T01:55:45,SageSaga,im pretty tired too- didnt get much sleep
18-10-2019T01:56:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Everyone seems to be lacking sleep this week
18-10-2019T01:56:22,Dadrobit,Worked out to a 14 hour shift essentially. Now I'm back at work and dying.
18-10-2019T01:56:22,Ordithus,Must be something in the water
18-10-2019T01:56:45,SageSaga,i had a doctors appointment over my internal pain ive been having for the past 4 months
18-10-2019T01:57:13,Xalrog,make sure it is :potable_water: before drinking
18-10-2019T01:57:17,SageSaga,here's hoping it's not cancer! . . . Doc wasnt reassuring on that note though <_<
18-10-2019T01:57:18,Ordithus,more pain?! :ptv-confused: Sage stop with the hurting
18-10-2019T01:57:21,Dadrobit,And didn't get sleep the previous day because of a pair of tests for my classes that I couldn't skip on.
18-10-2019T01:57:38,Xalrog,get well soon Sage
18-10-2019T01:57:50,Dadrobit,Good luck on the not cancer my dude
18-10-2019T01:57:56,SageSaga,you know when you explain something to the doctor and they go really quiet and say they want you to see a specialist asap?
18-10-2019T01:58:14,Ordithus,"Yeah, hope it isn't something bad"
18-10-2019T01:58:14,SageSaga,that was my doctor this morning!
18-10-2019T01:58:14,Dadrobit,Yes
18-10-2019T01:58:28,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah ideally dont get the cancer
18-10-2019T01:59:00,Dadrobit,Cancer would be sub-optimal
18-10-2019T02:00:52,SageSaga,"""So- how long do i have doc?"" ""As long as it takes for you to finish Artificial Incident"" "". . . then i just wont finish it!"" *and Sage lived forever*"

18-10-2019T02:03:24,unsteddyphoenix,Patrician taste
18-10-2019T02:03:36,SageSaga,its the story about a guy who turns into an exact copy of his favorite waifu
18-10-2019T02:04:05,Dadrobit,"Or is it like... Silence Of The Lambs style ""I became my own waifu""?"
18-10-2019T02:04:05,unsteddyphoenix,Oh so its not about a man seducing a girl version of himself?
18-10-2019T02:04:22,SageSaga,and being stuck like that- so it's all fun and masturbation until the novelty wears off and now he has to deal with being a cute girl in a modern society
18-10-2019T02:04:43,Dadrobit,Become a bitch lesbian.
18-10-2019T02:04:49,Dadrobit,Butch*

18-10-2019T02:05:52,Dadrobit,One of my best fucking friends in HS was a super Butch lesbo until her dad moved her away.
18-10-2019T02:06:02,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Take a journey to Antarctica.
18-10-2019T02:06:04,unsteddyphoenix,Was she jacked?

18-10-2019T02:07:02,Dadrobit,"Yeah, she was fit as heck. It was awesome. Played euphonium in the marching band with me."

18-10-2019T02:08:45,Dadrobit,She helped me land my first real long term girlfriend. Best wingman ever.
18-10-2019T02:08:46,SageSaga,"ive got one friend who is gender fluid - and it was like ""What do I call you since i dont know what you are at a time?"" and they were like ""Well my name is a unisex name already"" and i was like-- but not if i type it!"""
18-10-2019T02:08:57,unsteddyphoenix,No im normal
18-10-2019T02:09:18,unsteddyphoenix,What was the name? :thinking:
18-10-2019T02:09:28,SageSaga,Jeri
18-10-2019T02:09:36,SageSaga,or Jerry
18-10-2019T02:09:49,Dadrobit,Was gonna guess Alex
18-10-2019T02:09:51,unsteddyphoenix,Is Jeri a real name
18-10-2019T02:09:56,SageSaga,yes
18-10-2019T02:10:00,unsteddyphoenix,Hmmm
18-10-2019T02:10:08,Ordithus,"I don't know, never met a Jeri"
18-10-2019T02:10:10,unsteddyphoenix,Im pretty sure Jerry is just masculine
18-10-2019T02:10:13,Dadrobit,Short for Jericho
18-10-2019T02:10:34,SageSaga,ive met several women who went by Jeri
18-10-2019T02:10:44,unsteddyphoenix,What was their full name?
18-10-2019T02:10:48,SageSaga,one was Jerika
18-10-2019T02:10:50,Ordithus,Might be a regional thing?
18-10-2019T02:10:55,unsteddyphoenix,lmao
18-10-2019T02:11:25,SageSaga,i only knew the other by Jeri so i never asked
18-10-2019T02:12:15,SageSaga,Jerry is masculine but Jeri is feminine- but they are both said the same way
18-10-2019T02:12:20,SageSaga,like Jesse and Jessie
18-10-2019T02:12:34,Dadrobit,"Jericho and similar names would suck through middle school. Too easy to manipulate into something like ""Jerk-o"" and the like."
18-10-2019T02:12:39,unsteddyphoenix,Jesse and....
18-10-2019T02:12:41,unsteddyphoenix,America is weird
18-10-2019T02:12:56,SageSaga,Sage is just straight up a unisex name XD
18-10-2019T02:13:03,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Jesse, we have to make an not necessary movie"
18-10-2019T02:13:05,unsteddyphoenix,Sage is not a name!
18-10-2019T02:13:09,MarvTheHugPharaoh,non*
18-10-2019T02:13:12,SageSaga,it totally is a name
18-10-2019T02:13:14,Dadrobit,"Can confirm. Have a sister named Jessie, and a buddy named Jesse."
18-10-2019T02:13:53,Dadrobit,America confirmed weird.

18-10-2019T02:16:04,JojoF2415,My aunt and god father call me jojo
18-10-2019T02:16:34,SageSaga,and Jojo was strictly a girls name - not short for anything in the english origin
18-10-2019T02:16:41,JojoF2415,I was watching sad events that happened in America
18-10-2019T02:17:01,Dadrobit,Which ones?

18-10-2019T02:17:22,Dadrobit,"Gotta be specific my dude, they blend"

18-10-2019T02:25:54,unsteddyphoenix,Until she becomes a jacked up tsundere punching all the boys into crators
18-10-2019T02:25:54,SageSaga,"at least you werent that poor girl named ""Ash-shoal"" that was not how it was spelled"
18-10-2019T02:26:45,JojoF2415,Attack on titan

18-10-2019T02:27:06,SageSaga,we randomly naming anime now?
18-10-2019T02:27:21,Dadrobit,Or that one dude who was named a long string of numbers by his hippy anti-establishment parents.

18-10-2019T02:30:46,Dadrobit,:( can't find the video on YT. The number guy eventually became a singing stand up comedian who wrote a song about his name.
18-10-2019T02:31:03,Dadrobit,Looking him up only gets me numberphile videos.
18-10-2019T02:31:14,Ordithus,he has that many fans
18-10-2019T02:31:19,JojoF2415,I have a YouTube channel

18-10-2019T02:31:31,JojoF2415,I started it 3 weeks ago
18-10-2019T02:31:35,Dadrobit,Not that I upload too often
18-10-2019T02:31:37,SageSaga,maaan- i just was thinking about this anime ive been watching- things are gonna get dark if the family finds out their little daughter died and has been body snatched by a 20 year old librarian...
18-10-2019T02:31:55,Dadrobit,Is.... Is that the title???
18-10-2019T02:32:07,Ordithus,"Sounds like it is already dark, they just don't know it yet"
18-10-2019T02:32:12,JojoF2415,I record myself in time lapse drawing
18-10-2019T02:32:13,SageSaga,nah- its called Ascendance of a Bookworm
18-10-2019T02:32:27,JojoF2415,Tell a tell heart
18-10-2019T02:32:36,Dadrobit,Have you gotten to the hot springs episode yet?
18-10-2019T02:32:46,steelabjur,"Sage, no, I was ""Fhiontáin"" until my parents could get a notary to change it. Always fun seeing teachers try to pronounce it though!"
18-10-2019T02:33:06,unsteddyphoenix,Man
18-10-2019T02:33:08,Dadrobit,"That's a kick-ass name, not gonna lie"
18-10-2019T02:33:09,SageSaga,Ascendance of a Bookworm so far is totally wholesome! sorta
18-10-2019T02:33:20,SageSaga,they did open it weird-
18-10-2019T02:33:25,unsteddyphoenix,I mean. I guess nazi little girl anime had a similar premise and I enjoyed that
18-10-2019T02:34:04,Dadrobit,Something something Nazi pun
18-10-2019T02:34:45,SageSaga,trailer for the anime im talking about - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TljLLncMxk
18-10-2019T02:36:44,unsteddyphoenix,Wow all those awards
18-10-2019T02:37:06,SageSaga,i saw 2 episodes of the show
18-10-2019T02:37:13,SageSaga,and then i read all of the manga
18-10-2019T02:37:20,JojoF2415,I rarely watch anime
18-10-2019T02:37:21,SageSaga,then i bought the book XD
18-10-2019T02:37:28,Dadrobit,"I'm.... Not exactly sold. It's kinda cute, but I can't say it's something that I would seek out ya know?"
18-10-2019T02:37:50,SageSaga,it's not for everyone sure
18-10-2019T02:37:51,unsteddyphoenix,Most of the time I just watch it if sage talks about it
18-10-2019T02:37:52,Ordithus,"Huh, not what I expected"
18-10-2019T02:38:01,SageSaga,but its surprisingly fun and interesting
18-10-2019T02:38:03,JojoF2415,All I do is play video games and draw
18-10-2019T02:38:06,unsteddyphoenix,Easy way to get anime
18-10-2019T02:38:10,Dadrobit,"It looks very feel good, which I get. Just not sold on the premise."
18-10-2019T02:38:22,JojoF2415,Mr stark I don’t feel so good
18-10-2019T02:38:54,SageSaga,it's a lot like if a modern person was thrown back in time with all their memories-
18-10-2019T02:39:10,SageSaga,with the added difficulty of being in a weak and terminally ill childs body XD
18-10-2019T02:39:26,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Like reverse Dr Stone
18-10-2019T02:39:30,SageSaga,yep
18-10-2019T02:39:35,SageSaga,which i also love Dr Stone btw
18-10-2019T02:39:44,MarvTheHugPharaoh,It's super fun
18-10-2019T02:39:58,JojoF2415,I feel like you all are adults
18-10-2019T02:40:01,SageSaga,Dr Stone is a lot more fun and educational for sure
18-10-2019T02:40:04,Dadrobit,"Someone thrown into the future with no memories, but a kick-ass sturdy body?"
18-10-2019T02:40:18,SageSaga,I am an adult of course- ive been doing my comic for almost 16 years now-
18-10-2019T02:40:42,JojoF2415,Dam it’s older than me
18-10-2019T02:40:43,steelabjur,"At 40 years old, I AM an adult (sorta). ;p"
18-10-2019T02:40:59,Dadrobit,< Adult as heck here. I'm currently yeeting myself towards 30.
18-10-2019T02:41:01,Ordithus,"31, does that count?"
18-10-2019T02:41:04,SageSaga,lol No Dr Stone is a world where all humans have been turned into stone - and nearly 3800 years later he breaks free
18-10-2019T02:41:15,JojoF2415,What is dr stone

18-10-2019T02:41:51,JojoF2415,My friend tells me about it. I just ignore it
18-10-2019T02:41:59,SageSaga,"Soap is called the Dr Stone because its a ""Stone"" that keeps you from getting sick"
18-10-2019T02:42:16,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I'm the baby gotta love me

18-10-2019T02:44:58,steelabjur,"lol what do you mean, friend unsteddyphonix? We are all organic beings here ."

18-10-2019T02:45:25,unsteddyphoenix,I was too lazy~ would be hard to find his timeline now
18-10-2019T02:45:26,JojoF2415,I’m leaving so I can watch memes
18-10-2019T02:45:33,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Think so
18-10-2019T02:45:35,unsteddyphoenix,God that guy was great
18-10-2019T02:45:39,Dadrobit,o/
18-10-2019T02:45:48,Dadrobit,James was a treat
18-10-2019T02:45:58,SageSaga,Let us all drink water and consume animals as we humans do!
18-10-2019T02:46:34,steelabjur,"indeed, fellow organic sage!"
18-10-2019T02:47:26,SageSaga,quick question- does the sounds of your own internal organs bother you as the squish and slosh inside you? Just curious
18-10-2019T02:47:46,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Your organs are internal?
18-10-2019T02:48:22,Dadrobit,"Physically bother, or psychologically?"
18-10-2019T02:48:25,unsteddyphoenix,Organs~ lots of slippery organs~
18-10-2019T02:48:27,SageSaga,the internal ones are! You cannot fool me into giving away my secret
18-10-2019T02:49:13,Dadrobit,I just bust out a microphone when I notice audible sounds happening. Makes it easy to collect great sounds for my library.
18-10-2019T02:49:33,RedDragonSyndicate,yo
18-10-2019T02:49:39,SageSaga,yo Red!

18-10-2019T02:52:58,SageSaga,"I also started watching ""High School Prodigies have it easy even in another world"""
18-10-2019T02:53:48,SageSaga,"some titles are really great these days- you dont even need a description of the story anymore! you just read the title and go ""That sounds weird but maybe interesting!"""
18-10-2019T02:54:17,Ordithus,You can judge a book by its cover!
18-10-2019T02:54:47,Dadrobit,"Ohhh, speaking of book, does anyone here read Erfworld?"
18-10-2019T02:54:58,unsteddyphoenix,We're getting closer to the futurama future
18-10-2019T02:55:00,unsteddyphoenix,And im all about it
18-10-2019T02:55:17,unsteddyphoenix,mmmm I read some. When the comic bit sorta ended I fell off
18-10-2019T02:55:20,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I want a shiny metal ass
18-10-2019T02:55:26,Dadrobit,"If you do/did and haven't checked in in a while, I'd suggest going now and saving a personal copy."
18-10-2019T02:55:29,unsteddyphoenix,Because the internet killed my ability to read
18-10-2019T02:55:35,unsteddyphoenix,Oh??
18-10-2019T02:55:49,Dadrobit,The text updates were temporary btw.
18-10-2019T02:55:58,SageSaga,eh?
18-10-2019T02:56:02,Dadrobit,"Yeah, the author went full nuclear option."
18-10-2019T02:56:22,SageSaga,please explain
18-10-2019T02:56:39,unsteddyphoenix,He's deleting it?
18-10-2019T02:56:43,unsteddyphoenix,Its so interesting though
18-10-2019T02:56:47,Dadrobit,"Completely wiped the whole place. Deleted the forums, wiki, took all the amazing fan work down as well."
18-10-2019T02:56:49,JojoF2415,Hello
18-10-2019T02:57:03,unsteddyphoenix,But...why though
18-10-2019T02:57:30,BadFoMo,What are we talking about?
18-10-2019T02:57:46,Dadrobit,"Literally just redirects to a sparse explanation of ""bad shit happened"" and a link to barebones archives that will only last for who knows how long."
18-10-2019T02:58:14,unsteddyphoenix,Man what. Thats annoying.
18-10-2019T02:58:37,Dadrobit,Some information was given out via an audio file to select people who donated money and we're trustworthy.
18-10-2019T02:58:45,RedDragonSyndicate,this is a great expression
18-10-2019T02:58:52,Ordithus,it is
18-10-2019T02:59:01,unsteddyphoenix,Big $$ does not equal trustworthy when will they LEARN
18-10-2019T02:59:12,Dadrobit,"I didn't get access to the file, but I did some sleuthing myself and figured out what went down."
18-10-2019T02:59:16,unsteddyphoenix,Well shit. Erfworld had so many good ideas
18-10-2019T03:00:01,SageSaga,ty Red
18-10-2019T03:00:06,Dadrobit,"No joke, some seriously fucked shit happened that I found in news articles regarding the ""big bad thing"""
18-10-2019T03:00:12,SageSaga,and ive never heard of Erfworld till now
18-10-2019T03:00:18,Dadrobit,That I won't even type here.
18-10-2019T03:00:54,unsteddyphoenix,What I read was really good
18-10-2019T03:00:57,Dadrobit,"And I will say that while I don't agree with the decision or implementation, I do understand in this one case."
18-10-2019T03:01:14,Ordithus,"Hmm sleepy. Thanks for the stream, Sage, and good night! :ctwokinds-RainezZz:"
18-10-2019T03:01:19,unsteddyphoenix,gnight!

18-10-2019T03:01:35,Dadrobit,"Yeah, Erfworld was great up through book two and arguably three was great."
18-10-2019T03:01:35,BadFoMo,Good night.
18-10-2019T03:01:43,SageSaga,sleep well Ord
18-10-2019T03:01:45,unsteddyphoenix,Upsetting. Trust noone not even your top donators I guess
18-10-2019T03:01:48,Dadrobit,Night ord
18-10-2019T03:02:29,BadFoMo,What books are are we talking about?
18-10-2019T03:02:33,Dadrobit,"No, no one actually leaked anything so far as I can tell, I just started looking through news articles in the area of the author and his name."
18-10-2019T03:02:50,Dadrobit,"Erfworld, fantastic web comic/book"
18-10-2019T03:03:08,BadFoMo,Thanks.
18-10-2019T03:03:42,Dadrobit,The last two chapters were dealing with some serious power creep that kinda ruined a lot of the 6D chess of the earlier chapters.
18-10-2019T03:04:43,Dadrobit,"Either way, very sad. Erfworld was one of my very first webcomics that I got into."
18-10-2019T03:05:13,Dadrobit,"Been with them since, hell 2006-7?"
18-10-2019T03:05:29,BadFoMo,Sorry.
18-10-2019T03:07:24,SageSaga,I shall... outlast
18-10-2019T03:07:55,Dadrobit,It was essentially: fat loser dude whose a great D&D GM gets issekai'd into a parody D&D and must serve a king whose a tool.
18-10-2019T03:07:59,SageSaga,just need Penny arcade to stop being a webcomic-
18-10-2019T03:08:04,Dadrobit,Who's*
18-10-2019T03:08:48,SageSaga,sounds like a story i would like
18-10-2019T03:09:34,JojoF2415,Geometry dash zodiac
18-10-2019T03:09:35,SageSaga,of course i would learn about it - when its being deleted
18-10-2019T03:10:27,Dadrobit,"I... I dunno if you'd like it. It relies on visual puns. Like, everything in the world is wordplay."
18-10-2019T03:10:34,unsteddyphoenix,Lmao oh yeah
18-10-2019T03:10:36,unsteddyphoenix,All the math puns
18-10-2019T03:11:05,Dadrobit,The moneymancer named Benny who literally just looks like a gangsta' Ben Franklin.
18-10-2019T03:11:44,SageSaga,i have no problem with well done puns- just most arent
18-10-2019T03:11:57,Dadrobit,"But the characters and world are incredibly well developed. Like, I honestly cannot name a story with better character Dynamics and evolutions."
18-10-2019T03:14:59,SageSaga,"""Man i really like this book but it's a pretty difficult to read"" ""What is it called?"" ""Well i forgot the title- but each story follows from the children of the first story"" ""Ah - is it Jojo's Bizarre Adventure?"" ""Nah it doesnt have anyone named Jojo"""
18-10-2019T03:15:37,Dadrobit,I think the Freehold series is kinda like that? Kinda?
18-10-2019T03:15:43,SageSaga,"""Well- how does it start?"" ""Oh dude it starts like this- In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth"" ""Dude that's the bible"" ""If you already know it dont spoil it!"":"
18-10-2019T03:15:47,Dadrobit,Kind of a shit series though

18-10-2019T03:17:34,Dadrobit,Suuuuuper far into fantasy liberal territory well beyond the edge of suspending disbelief
18-10-2019T03:17:58,SageSaga,"""duuuude! i can't believe this guy betrayed Jesus!"" ""You mean Judas? The most famous betrayer -"""
18-10-2019T03:18:26,Dadrobit,"Like, the author read of bunch of Heinlein novels and wanted to write ""like that"" but he's shit at writing."

18-10-2019T03:21:39,SageSaga,My webcomic is about a person trapped in a virtual fantasy RPG as his character- but his characters backstory as an elf is hundreds of years old so most of his mind gets wiped out in the process
18-10-2019T03:22:26,JojoF2415,Cool
18-10-2019T03:22:27,SageSaga,"trying to unravel the mystery of what happened, why the fantasy world has changed so much, and what happened to her former self"

18-10-2019T14:05:51,RimaDraws,maybe i would
18-10-2019T14:05:58,RimaDraws,but depends on their anatomy
18-10-2019T14:06:37,sunblaze,hiya
18-10-2019T14:06:39,SageSaga,i dont think Tom even reads/watches One Piece - seems too long for him :P
18-10-2019T14:06:43,SageSaga,yo Sunblaze!
18-10-2019T14:07:04,RimaDraws,i dont even see the point in me streaming today lol
18-10-2019T14:07:09,RimaDraws,but yea one piece is too long
18-10-2019T14:07:14,RimaDraws,like 28 seasons?
18-10-2019T14:08:01,TeapotOfDoom,I made the mistake of starting to read the first manga
18-10-2019T14:08:38,TeapotOfDoom,I kept it away from me ever since for my own good. I can't imagine what would happen if I got my hands on that stuff.
18-10-2019T14:11:08,AnuSekaniArt,Eyyy Sage!

18-10-2019T14:18:13,RimaDraws,was streaming but i cut it short since its pointless
18-10-2019T14:18:14,SageSaga,did y'all noticed that last night I posted all the rules into chat for new people- and after posting said rules someone broke one of the rules we havent had to enforce in a loooooong time?
18-10-2019T14:18:20,RimaDraws,?
18-10-2019T14:18:23,RimaDraws,no i fell asleep
18-10-2019T14:18:46,TeapotOfDoom,what happened?
18-10-2019T14:18:49,sunblaze,^that
18-10-2019T14:18:52,SageSaga,it was a rule no one was breaking- until the rule was told XD
18-10-2019T14:19:03,RimaDraws,oh someone advertised
18-10-2019T14:19:05,TeapotOfDoom,classic i'd say
18-10-2019T14:19:05,SageSaga,"it was the ""no self promotion"" rule"
18-10-2019T14:19:08,RimaDraws,and they already been told no
18-10-2019T14:19:18,AnuSekaniArt,Oh wow

18-10-2019T14:19:29,AnuSekaniArt,"Well, hopefully they learned their lesson lol"
18-10-2019T14:19:40,TeapotOfDoom,:hammer: :ctwokinds-nataniAAAAshake:
18-10-2019T14:19:45,RimaDraws,they probably got banned

18-10-2019T14:20:00,Kynum,sup
18-10-2019T14:20:00,SageSaga,i think it was an honest mistake
18-10-2019T14:20:02,TeapotOfDoom,awww
18-10-2019T14:20:07,TeapotOfDoom,yo kynum o/
18-10-2019T14:20:39,SageSaga,i just found it funny that after so long someone did that right after we did a refresh on the rules XD

18-10-2019T14:27:41,ZRO4825,Any time. <3
18-10-2019T14:27:44,TeapotOfDoom,lol
18-10-2019T14:28:05,TeapotOfDoom,i love the expression of complete and utter confusion
18-10-2019T14:28:48,ZRO4825,"I find it amusing we have that exchange, and then Sage swaps to a panel of Nyna going ""Seriously?"" :rofl:"
18-10-2019T14:28:57,SageSaga,so while i was once again unable to sleep most of the night- i went ahead and read more of that book I got...
18-10-2019T14:29:52,RimaDraws,i have been up since 5 and havent been able to go back to sleep
18-10-2019T14:30:34,Sclimshady,"Hey same,  I was in my car on the way to work before I remembered it was saturday"
18-10-2019T14:30:43,SageSaga,i went to bed at 5:30 and fell asleep around 8
18-10-2019T14:31:17,ZRO4825,"there's a feeling I understand all too well, oof."
18-10-2019T14:31:19,SageSaga,Sclim- did you recover by getting some breakfast somewhere and going home?
18-10-2019T14:31:40,TeapotOfDoom,lol sclim now that's at least a pleasant surprise i would say?
18-10-2019T14:31:41,Sclimshady,"Yeah,  mcdonalds"
18-10-2019T14:31:56,SageSaga,McD's has some good breakfast junk
18-10-2019T14:32:16,SageSaga,too bad after that they turn into bleh the fast food joint
18-10-2019T14:32:18,AnuSekaniArt,Oh wow Sclim XD
18-10-2019T14:32:23,TeapotOfDoom,i went to bed at about 4am and got up around 12ish
18-10-2019T14:32:25,Sclimshady,"Its just so expensive now, I typically go to in-n-out because its cheaper"
18-10-2019T14:32:30,Sclimshady,Somehow
18-10-2019T14:32:35,TeapotOfDoom,being a student is hard yo
18-10-2019T14:32:42,SageSaga,ive never had In-n-out
18-10-2019T14:32:50,RimaDraws,im a student and i work yea its hard
18-10-2019T14:32:50,RimaDraws,lol
18-10-2019T14:33:07,Sclimshady,You need some genuine California In-n-out :csagesaga-lannut:
18-10-2019T14:33:14,TeapotOfDoom,i know it all to well rima ^^
18-10-2019T14:33:22,RimaDraws,i also live on my own lol
18-10-2019T14:33:22,SageSaga,well im on the other side of the country
18-10-2019T14:34:12,TeapotOfDoom,now there's your problem
18-10-2019T14:34:37,RimaDraws,uh im 32 i dont want to live with my parents
18-10-2019T14:35:16,ZRO4825,"I'm 36, and live with mine again ever since a job loss years ago. And now shit's just too damned expensive not to."
18-10-2019T14:35:27,AnuSekaniArt,"Am 23 and have my own apartment. Can confirm though, stuff is pricey"
18-10-2019T14:35:39,AnuSekaniArt,And all this before I have to pay for my own health insurance
18-10-2019T14:35:49,RimaDraws,you got a reason zro
18-10-2019T14:37:29,RimaDraws,i moved out of my grandparents house last year because i needed my privacy and i felt i was ready to be on my own again
18-10-2019T14:37:36,RimaDraws,took me a while to adjust to it after 5 years
18-10-2019T14:38:13,SageSaga,moving out just isnt an option for me- unless i want to live in the woods
18-10-2019T14:38:37,TeapotOfDoom,tbh being european seems to be way cheaper
18-10-2019T14:38:56,RimaDraws,well i was also full of sass and dont take crap from no one so i was tired of it
18-10-2019T14:39:01,SageSaga,i would have to move to a location where I could afford the living expenses- but the price to move to such a place is too expensive-
18-10-2019T14:39:30,Sclimshady,The woods sounds nice
18-10-2019T14:39:43,SageSaga,i'll just wait for Tom to buy his new house and move in with him and be his personal chef
18-10-2019T14:39:54,FoxxTrotter,Heh. ^_^
18-10-2019T14:39:57,sunblaze,@ Sclimshady no interwebs in the wilderness
18-10-2019T14:40:03,Sclimshady,Gordon Ramsage
18-10-2019T14:40:07,AnuSekaniArt,Gonna get an apron too Sage? :P
18-10-2019T14:40:23,TeapotOfDoom,lol
18-10-2019T14:40:28,SageSaga,"my apron will say ""Please dont kick me out, I'll cook you food"""
18-10-2019T14:40:32,AnuSekaniArt,XD
18-10-2019T14:40:35,Sclimshady,With a heart at the end
18-10-2019T14:40:42,TeapotOfDoom,at least then tom will eat something other then canned spaghetti
18-10-2019T14:40:48,TeapotOfDoom,lol
18-10-2019T14:40:56,AnuSekaniArt,With Flora and Kaylin on it as well :P
18-10-2019T14:40:59,RimaDraws,i wish you would cook for me sage. i wouldnt make you pay rent
18-10-2019T14:41:02,RimaDraws,just half of the other bills
18-10-2019T14:42:28,AnuSekaniArt,"I mean, I can afford all my bills with my job"
18-10-2019T14:42:35,AnuSekaniArt,I just can't save up too much at the moment
18-10-2019T14:43:24,TeapotOfDoom,i am serously confused
18-10-2019T14:43:50,TeapotOfDoom,in the introduction slides it says that the deadline is tomorrow
18-10-2019T14:44:01,TeapotOfDoom,on the website however it says next week
18-10-2019T14:44:09,TeapotOfDoom,i don't trust this
18-10-2019T14:44:13,TeapotOfDoom,i shall do it now
18-10-2019T14:45:22,Sclimshady,"Just dont do it,  thats my philosophy and I havent failed yet"
