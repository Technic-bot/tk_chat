11-07-2019T15:35:49,AspiringNoodle,I hate job postings -_-
11-07-2019T15:36:09,AspiringNoodle,They add so much damn fluff in the descriptions
11-07-2019T15:36:24,AspiringNoodle,Honestly makes me want to slap the people making the job postings. GET. DOWN. TO. ESSENTIALS.
11-07-2019T15:37:02,CrimsonQuill,I don't know if the beureacracy of the world would allow that...
11-07-2019T15:46:04,AspiringNoodle,Looking at a target job posting
11-07-2019T15:46:13,AspiringNoodle,It's for cashier / front of store attendant
11-07-2019T15:46:24,AspiringNoodle,Excuse me while I count out the number of bullet points on this page
11-07-2019T15:46:47,AspiringNoodle,34
11-07-2019T15:47:09,CrimsonQuill,Oh crumbs.
11-07-2019T15:49:30,AspiringNoodle,Now I remember why I procrastinate on this front
11-07-2019T15:49:44,AspiringNoodle,The pure levels of BS that are just thrown onto these pages...
11-07-2019T15:50:04,CrimsonQuill,I'm redrawing my art trade
11-07-2019T15:50:14,CrimsonQuill,I was dissatisfied because I rushed it.

11-07-2019T15:50:33,CrimsonQuill,And maybe even include a cameo of Halo Raine and my other OC....

11-07-2019T15:58:17,Bgrmystr2,Storm's gonna start hitting us hard around 8pm.. probably.
11-07-2019T15:58:22,Bgrmystr2,8 or 9pm
11-07-2019T15:58:30,Bgrmystr2,and 8pm is when the streams start for me.
11-07-2019T16:00:17,SpazztasticKiwi,‚Äúpeekaboo mf‚Äù üåß ‚õàüåß
11-07-2019T16:00:35,CrimsonQuill,Are you going to be ok Bgr?
11-07-2019T16:00:42,CrimsonQuill,"Also, evenign Spazztastic!"
11-07-2019T16:02:05,Bgrmystr2,lol no worries we'll prolly lose power and I'll miss the streams on Fri and maybe sunday. But that's just to be expected.
11-07-2019T16:02:20,Bgrmystr2,"There may be tornados so I dunno about those, unpredictable bastards, them."
11-07-2019T16:02:34,CrimsonQuill,I hope you'll be able to make Sunday...
11-07-2019T16:02:46,CrimsonQuill,"Also, Tornadoes? Uh oh."
11-07-2019T16:02:54,CrimsonQuill,Those are nasty buggers.
11-07-2019T16:03:06,CrimsonQuill,I've seen countless videos.
11-07-2019T16:03:09,Bgrmystr2,The rain making the levees fail is probably the only thing I'm worried about :ocean: :house_with_garden:
11-07-2019T16:05:27,CrimsonQuill,Are you likely to be flooded?
11-07-2019T16:06:41,Bgrmystr2,"We do not live in a flood zone, but just with the very little it dropped we had about 1 1/2 foot of water in our street"
11-07-2019T16:07:00,Bgrmystr2,it only dropped bout 6ish inches? or so before going into the gulf
11-07-2019T16:08:04,Bgrmystr2,"flooding may or may not be an issue, more likely to not be the case, but since I live within walking distance of a levee, if it fails, there's more than enough water to wash the whole neighborhood away."
11-07-2019T16:08:34,Bgrmystr2,so it's just a matter of whether it will or not.
11-07-2019T16:09:25,CrimsonQuill,...That sounds very bad.
11-07-2019T16:09:43,Bgrmystr2,yeh well.. wasn't my choice to live in this house.
11-07-2019T16:09:48,CrimsonQuill,I'm surprised that you're not panicking...I would.
11-07-2019T16:10:04,CrimsonQuill,"Then again, I don't have a very level head on my shoulders..."
11-07-2019T16:10:07,Bgrmystr2,"it's unsettling, but I ain't 13."
11-07-2019T16:10:18,Bgrmystr2,I've gone through this several times prior
11-07-2019T16:10:53,Bgrmystr2,"panicing doesn't help anything, only makes it worse"
11-07-2019T16:12:28,CrimsonQuill,True.
11-07-2019T16:12:42,CrimsonQuill,"Well, I really hope that you'll make it through alright."
11-07-2019T16:12:49,CrimsonQuill,And that the levees hold for everyone.
11-07-2019T16:13:03,CrimsonQuill,I hope no one gets flooded.
11-07-2019T16:13:58,Bgrmystr2,"yeah same, but its only a matter of time."
11-07-2019T16:14:10,Bgrmystr2,they were never made to handle that level of water
11-07-2019T16:14:44,CrimsonQuill,How long will those storms continue for?
11-07-2019T16:15:14,Bgrmystr2,"this one's slow, so it's been extending the length of time it'll likely stay over the area"
11-07-2019T16:15:33,CrimsonQuill,So more flood risk as it passes over.
11-07-2019T16:16:01,Bgrmystr2,We already had flood risk when it passed over the first time and the flooding is still there in some places far as I'm aware
11-07-2019T16:16:13,Bgrmystr2,and that's just going to stack on top of what's already there
11-07-2019T16:16:16,CrimsonQuill,Oof.
11-07-2019T16:16:46,Bgrmystr2,apparently as much as 20 inches according to one article on Vox as of this time yesterday
11-07-2019T16:17:14,Bgrmystr2,"the river's expected to rise bout 19 or 20 foot by the weekend, which is the height of the city's levees."
11-07-2019T16:17:27,CrimsonQuill,"Not good,"
11-07-2019T16:17:31,CrimsonQuill,So...
11-07-2019T16:17:43,CrimsonQuill,Are there evacuation plans should the worst happen?
11-07-2019T16:18:15,Bgrmystr2,"nope, they told us to stay home and take shelter here"
11-07-2019T16:18:18,Bgrmystr2,:U
11-07-2019T16:18:43,CrimsonQuill,"...It doesn't appear to be the best option, if you ask me."
11-07-2019T16:18:51,Bgrmystr2,no kidding
11-07-2019T16:19:13,Bgrmystr2,"but they've said noone should be driving past 8pm. not sure if curfew due to storm / flooding or what, but"
11-07-2019T16:19:17,Bgrmystr2,just what I was told
11-07-2019T16:19:45,Bgrmystr2,This is the forcast so far. https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/storm_graphics/AT02/refresh/AL022019_key_messages+png/204123_key_messages_sm.png
11-07-2019T16:20:17,Bgrmystr2,"It's basically going to be right on top when the streams start so that's cool. and it'll be here all friday night, and probably all saturday morning.."
11-07-2019T16:20:39,Bgrmystr2,just dumping rain.
11-07-2019T16:20:54,CrimsonQuill,...How much of your stuff can you make sure is dry if it floods?
11-07-2019T16:21:31,Bgrmystr2,ehh well.. I kind of don't have many places other than putting stuff on top my bed or desk
11-07-2019T16:21:50,CrimsonQuill,:ctwokinds-keithdotdotdot:
11-07-2019T16:22:01,Bgrmystr2,a lot of my stuff is electronics in boxes on shelves
11-07-2019T16:22:17,Bgrmystr2,"so if the house floods, there's not much I can do."
11-07-2019T16:22:45,CrimsonQuill,...I just don't know what to say...
11-07-2019T16:23:28,Bgrmystr2,¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø hope it doesn't flood and save what can't be replaced with insurance money.
11-07-2019T16:23:43,Bgrmystr2,prolly about what I'd say.
11-07-2019T16:23:58,CrimsonQuill,Yeah...please God.
11-07-2019T16:24:06,Bgrmystr2,it'll likely be fine
11-07-2019T16:24:20,Bgrmystr2,but I ain't no crystal ball.
11-07-2019T16:24:21,CrimsonQuill,"Jeepers, I'm worried about a flood thousands of miles over the Atlantic ocean..."
11-07-2019T16:24:25,Bgrmystr2,haha
11-07-2019T16:24:33,CrimsonQuill,When I have exams in 5 weeks....
11-07-2019T16:24:45,CrimsonQuill,And it's 10:25pm. XD
11-07-2019T16:25:12,SpazztasticKiwi,invest in the sealing powers of Irish doors
11-07-2019T16:25:21,SpazztasticKiwi,they don‚Äôt fuk about
11-07-2019T16:25:30,CrimsonQuill,"Heh, not all of them are sealed, trust me."
11-07-2019T16:25:33,CrimsonQuill,Same in the UK.
11-07-2019T16:25:57,CrimsonQuill,"Actually, Spazz, why 'Irish' doors? Because of the rain?"
11-07-2019T16:26:11,CrimsonQuill,Just curious.
11-07-2019T16:26:25,Bgrmystr2,lol do irish windows exist
11-07-2019T16:26:26,Bgrmystr2,and walls?
11-07-2019T16:26:28,Bgrmystr2,:V
11-07-2019T16:26:31,Bgrmystr2,cuz that'd be great too

11-07-2019T16:27:59,CrimsonQuill,"True-Cork is hit by nasty floods, sometimes, and houses are destroyed...or you get those doors."
11-07-2019T16:28:10,CrimsonQuill,Proven to handle the flooding of the river Lee.
11-07-2019T16:28:14,CrimsonQuill,Now coming to Wisconsin
11-07-2019T16:28:50,Bgrmystr2,lol well then
11-07-2019T16:29:33,Bgrmystr2,"to be fair, Ireland doesn't get wind gusts that can quite literally crack your door in half because fuck breaking the hinges."
11-07-2019T16:29:58,Bgrmystr2,"happened to my dad's front door after Katrina, and that was a bigass hardwood door."
11-07-2019T16:30:01,CrimsonQuill,"Weeelll...on the West coast, I have heard of the odd nasty storm doing just that..."
11-07-2019T16:30:10,CrimsonQuill,And Storm Ophelia was really nasty.
11-07-2019T16:32:03,SpazztasticKiwi,mother nature sees you use her dead children and replies with backhand

11-07-2019T17:17:15,IronHorseComics,"yes, yes it does"
11-07-2019T17:20:11,AspiringNoodle,"I've been thinking, how long before we have a full-blown job crisis?"
11-07-2019T17:20:25,TerraTheWizard,10 years
11-07-2019T17:20:28,AspiringNoodle,Companies are becoming less and less willing to train new hires
11-07-2019T17:20:47,TerraTheWizard,i've been stuck looking for a job for 2 years
11-07-2019T17:20:51,AspiringNoodle,Job descriptions are getting fucking ridiculous (note my earlier complaint about a fucking TARGET application with 34 bullet points total)
11-07-2019T17:21:42,TerraTheWizard,"""just get a job in retail, that's how everyone starts"""
11-07-2019T17:21:50,TerraTheWizard,can't get past pre-screening
11-07-2019T17:21:55,IronHorseComics,"no, everyone starts in a warehouse job"
11-07-2019T17:22:18,IronHorseComics,"well not me, my first job was for an auto body shop"
11-07-2019T17:22:29,AspiringNoodle,"I have a degree in computer science, and I look at fucking retail jobs and am like... ""Do you want a damned manager or something?"""
11-07-2019T17:22:49,TerraTheWizard,i failed a degree in software engineering
11-07-2019T17:22:59,AspiringNoodle,"It's like, every job posting I look at wants you to have literally every possible skill that could ever just *maybe* show up at some point"
11-07-2019T17:23:23,TerraTheWizard,"""we don't want to train you, but we also don't want to pay you either"""
11-07-2019T17:23:45,AspiringNoodle,There's that long runningj oke about the number of years required to get a job going up
11-07-2019T17:23:49,AspiringNoodle,But it is going up
11-07-2019T17:23:58,AspiringNoodle,"And it's on over half of all ""entry-level"" positions"
11-07-2019T17:24:07,TerraTheWizard,also the fact jobs will take 16-18y/o's because they can pay them half minimum wage
11-07-2019T17:24:16,IronHorseComics,these companies want old people who are close to retiring so that they don't have to pay them decent money
11-07-2019T17:24:43,TerraTheWizard,i'm trying to get on an apprenticeship
11-07-2019T17:24:56,TerraTheWizard,but i've cornered myself in a way that i always end up doing
11-07-2019T17:25:00,AspiringNoodle,I'm glad I'm able to live with my parents
11-07-2019T17:25:16,TerraTheWizard,"i'm too qualified for the ones i want to do, but underqualified for the end job"
11-07-2019T17:25:16,AspiringNoodle,"They've mentioned that they expected this to probably happen, given the economy"
11-07-2019T17:25:44,AspiringNoodle,And I've been beating myself up because I consider it a failure on my end to mature into a responsible adult
11-07-2019T17:26:00,AspiringNoodle,"But jfc, these job postings"
11-07-2019T17:26:21,TerraTheWizard,so i was looking for certain jobs near me
11-07-2019T17:26:31,TerraTheWizard,nearest position was over 50 miles away
11-07-2019T17:26:33,AspiringNoodle,"""entry-level"" apparently doesn't exist anymore.  And the only people who can get them straight out of college are the prodigies who were doing shit like that in their spare time / for fun"
11-07-2019T17:27:37,TerraTheWizard,"it's starting to feel like it's ""figure out a way to become self-employed, or perish"""
11-07-2019T17:27:56,IronHorseComics,"when I was graduating college three years ago, I was encouraged to pursue local print shops"

11-07-2019T17:28:41,TerraTheWizard,"also from friends, those old people bully the new people out of the jobs"
11-07-2019T17:29:06,TerraTheWizard,"make the conditions hell, then use your friends in hr to fire you"
11-07-2019T17:29:13,AspiringNoodle,"There was a time in America where out of high school you'd get a job, you'd make your way up, you'd make a middle-class wage and be able to support a family on ONE working spouse"

11-07-2019T17:29:28,AspiringNoodle,"And on top of all that, you'd work 40 hours a week, tops"
11-07-2019T17:29:42,IronHorseComics,that was when people couldn't afford to go to college
11-07-2019T17:29:42,AspiringNoodle,"Now, both spouses need to work"
11-07-2019T17:29:53,AspiringNoodle,It's likely they'll work 50 hours minimum
11-07-2019T17:29:58,Bgrmystr2,"yeah noodle, pity even when both work, it's still not enough for the cheapest apartments :/"
11-07-2019T17:30:04,AspiringNoodle,Overtime / crunch is likely
11-07-2019T17:30:24,AspiringNoodle,AND they need to pursue learning in their spare time to develop the skills that will get them hired in the first place

11-07-2019T17:31:12,IronHorseComics,"oh that's nothing, when I was job searching all the decent graphic design positions wanted 5 years AND a bachelors"
11-07-2019T17:31:18,Bgrmystr2,10/10 no wonder everyone doesn't have jobs
11-07-2019T17:31:21,AspiringNoodle,I look at Robert Kotick (Activision-Blizzard CEO) as one of the best examples of everything wrong
11-07-2019T17:31:46,AspiringNoodle,That fatass makes 30M a year in salary and bonuses / stock options

11-07-2019T17:35:05,TerraTheWizard,now looking at code gives me an anxiety attack
11-07-2019T17:35:42,AspiringNoodle,"Also, don't get me started on all the different kinds of code that exists..."

11-07-2019T17:37:03,AspiringNoodle,Forgot about python

11-07-2019T17:37:42,AspiringNoodle,I love looking at job postings where they want you to know like 5 different languages
11-07-2019T17:37:58,AspiringNoodle,"Like... the fuck.  If your company is using 5+ programming languages, how the hell do you get anything done?!?"

11-07-2019T17:38:04,Combak,"Won't be able to make the stream, so say hi to everyone for me. XD"
11-07-2019T17:38:34,TerraTheWizard,if i could get paid for spelling/grammar checking job listings that'd be great

11-07-2019T17:38:49,TerraTheWizard,i've seen enough of them
11-07-2019T17:39:12,AspiringNoodle,Some people suggest I do stuff related to tech xD
11-07-2019T17:39:21,AspiringNoodle,I've done enough research into computer hardware
11-07-2019T17:39:22,IronHorseComics,"actually Terra, there is"

11-07-2019T17:41:18,IronHorseComics,"ah, thanks for pointing that out"
11-07-2019T17:44:46,AspiringNoodle,"Suddenly, my obsession with art / animation makes sense"
11-07-2019T17:45:02,AspiringNoodle,It's nearly impossible to make a convoluted job posting
11-07-2019T17:45:32,AspiringNoodle,"Well, unless you think Adobe Illustrator is actually for illustrators :ptv-snicker:"
11-07-2019T17:48:19,IronHorseComics,the strange thing is that I keep seeing people who DO use illustrator for illustrations
11-07-2019T17:48:25,IronHorseComics,it boggles my mind
11-07-2019T17:49:02,AspiringNoodle,"You *can*, but it's really not suited for illustration as a whole"
11-07-2019T17:49:13,Bgrmystr2,"seems silly that you wouldn't illustrate with a program called ""Illustrator"""
11-07-2019T17:49:26,Bgrmystr2,"so yes I would expect people to do so, but"
11-07-2019T17:49:30,Bgrmystr2,I know nothing of it so :V
11-07-2019T17:49:38,Bgrmystr2,I kinda don't really know nor care either way lol
11-07-2019T17:49:46,AspiringNoodle,"Well, just like you hate ""young people"" coming up with new terminology, illustrators hate Adobe for naming that program Illustrator"
11-07-2019T17:50:02,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
11-07-2019T17:50:09,IronHorseComics,"yeah, it's meant specifically for graphic design"
11-07-2019T17:50:14,AspiringNoodle,That program is meant for graphic design because it uses vectors
11-07-2019T17:50:28,TerraTheWizard,i knew someone who drew whole comics in illustrator
11-07-2019T17:50:36,AspiringNoodle,Absolute mad lad
11-07-2019T17:50:57,TerraTheWizard,think they use clip studio these days
11-07-2019T17:51:20,IronHorseComics,a lot of comic artists use it because of the vector line art
11-07-2019T17:51:41,IronHorseComics,if I figured out what they were doing to make it look good I'd do the same
11-07-2019T17:51:50,IronHorseComics,*a lot of professional
11-07-2019T17:53:32,AspiringNoodle,I think I'll stick with the more traditional raster approach :p
11-07-2019T17:53:38,AspiringNoodle,Just make massive 300 dpi files <3
11-07-2019T17:54:35,IronHorseComics,"I've been using clip studio for panel setup and lineart, works alright to me"
11-07-2019T17:54:57,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
11-07-2019T17:55:12,IronHorseComics,but everything else I do in photoshop (is booed and has shoes thrown at) because I can do quite a lot more with it
11-07-2019T18:17:20,IronHorseComics,"well now I've done it... found a very good traditional painter on youtube, now I feel inadequate, so par for the course"
11-07-2019T19:03:31,AspiringNoodle,"Don't look up sakimichan then, lol"
11-07-2019T19:03:50,IronHorseComics,wrong painter

11-07-2019T20:58:22,Bgrmystr2,Gladly. I don't want 20 inches of water on an already flooded river.
11-07-2019T20:58:25,IronHorseComics,"not sure mine would be uplifting advise but it's not a ""give up"" kind of thing"

11-07-2019T20:58:48,NextGenAnubisKid,I'd say just advertise on all the relevant sites?
11-07-2019T20:58:50,RimaDraws,lol
11-07-2019T20:58:58,SpazztasticKiwi,mother got me at Walmart looking for Stye. google says it‚Äôs an eye condition
11-07-2019T20:59:10,SpazztasticKiwi,I know You can get anything at Walmart but this is ridiculous
11-07-2019T20:59:13,Bgrmystr2,is there like a dance to stop the rain? Or should I do like.. the opposite of dancing?
11-07-2019T20:59:21,Bgrmystr2,is there an opposite?
11-07-2019T20:59:26,RimaDraws,sun dance
11-07-2019T20:59:44,Bgrmystr2,oo.... ehh.. I dunno if I like the sound of that.
11-07-2019T20:59:58,BadFoMo,"@IronHorseComics Ok, lets hear it."
11-07-2019T21:00:02,IronHorseComics,just don't flip off the storm clouds... you make yourself a lightning rod that way
11-07-2019T21:00:08,SpazztasticKiwi,just go tell the rain to feck off
11-07-2019T21:00:33,Bgrmystr2,it'll blow rain in my face.
11-07-2019T21:00:35,Nekonny,rain waters the planes ^^'

11-07-2019T21:00:59,Nekonny,If I may
11-07-2019T21:01:05,Bgrmystr2,I don't think planes need water. They drink fuel. :thinking:

11-07-2019T21:01:44,BadFoMo,I like animations.
11-07-2019T21:01:54,IronHorseComics,"okay, you asked for it my advise from personal experience is: expect no one to show up, it'll be a lot less disappointing to see no one but more uplifting if people DO show up"
11-07-2019T21:02:13,Bgrmystr2,would agree w/ iron on that
11-07-2019T21:02:24,Nekonny,you'll need audio though XD

11-07-2019T21:18:48,LannAF,gah I wanna play dnd so badly.
11-07-2019T21:19:03,LannAF,I was fiddling around with the character creator in barotrauma since kame wanted to make anthro characters
11-07-2019T21:19:05,NextGenAnubisKid,I know that feel. I play tomorrow with my normal group. XD
11-07-2019T21:19:10,LannAF,It...Actually seems fairly feasible.
11-07-2019T21:19:20,LannAF,like much easier than I thought it'd be
11-07-2019T21:19:28,NextGenAnubisKid,Oh yeah definitely. I've done that before.
11-07-2019T21:19:34,MarvTheHugPharaoh,You gotta teach me how to do that.
11-07-2019T21:19:41,NextGenAnubisKid,Plenty of material out there for that.
11-07-2019T21:19:56,LannAF,You can't actually create them fully atm unless the devs unlock the humanoid setting.
11-07-2019T21:20:16,NextGenAnubisKid,...oh are you talking the specific character creator you use?
11-07-2019T21:20:22,LannAF,Yes. We're talking about Barotrauma.
11-07-2019T21:20:29,NextGenAnubisKid,I thought you were talking D&D in general. XD
11-07-2019T21:20:30,NextGenAnubisKid,My bad
11-07-2019T21:20:37,LannAF,"No worries, I kinda segwayed that."

11-07-2019T21:21:00,LannAF,I'm terrified at the prospect Kame wants to make giant monster girl creatures though.

11-07-2019T21:21:22,Sclimshady,"Im terrified, but turned on as well"

11-07-2019T21:21:36,ZahnHolley,Kinky...
11-07-2019T21:21:37,LannAF,"Because Tom suggested giving them huge ""ballasts"" and I think I'm we're all going to regret that idea."

11-07-2019T21:22:00,LannAF,There's already a monster that does 0 damage statistically
11-07-2019T21:22:08,LannAF,The damage is purely from transferring kinetic energy
11-07-2019T21:22:18,LannAF,".....Which makes it WAY more dangerous than even the most dangerous enemy, surprisingly."
11-07-2019T21:22:29,RyanReaper,I feel like Maddie would be flustered at the naked dude in front of her.
11-07-2019T21:22:40,NextGenAnubisKid,How does that work Lann?

11-07-2019T21:23:30,CrRAR,*Wolfo used wolfish charm*
11-07-2019T21:23:38,CrRAR,*It's not very effective*
11-07-2019T21:23:42,MuonNeutrino,"also in that panel given that his head is at a lower height than hers even though he's gotta be taller than her, he's presumably not stood up yet"
11-07-2019T21:24:00,MuonNeutrino,"if she's going to get flustered, it'd probably be *after* he stands up >.>"
11-07-2019T21:24:22,BadFoMo,He's a Keidran; nudity is the norm for their kind.
11-07-2019T21:24:38,MuonNeutrino,"well, obviously *he* doesn't care"
11-07-2019T21:24:43,MuonNeutrino,maddie might be a bit perturbed tho
11-07-2019T21:24:46,RyanReaper,"Yeah to the left in the ‚Äúab‚Äù shot, she‚Äôs just lettin it free XD"

11-07-2019T21:25:52,RyanReaper,"Bastins aren‚Äôt used to the nudity X) she got all flustered at Nibs when she went Keidran, but maybe that‚Äôs just cuz she looked like a bastin (at least that‚Äôs what she said)"
11-07-2019T21:25:55,LannAF,Kinetic force destroys walls and jostles everybody in the submarine. They get stunned and hurt even if the monster isn't hitting their side.
11-07-2019T21:26:06,CrRAR,lol
11-07-2019T21:26:07,NextGenAnubisKid,"Ah yeah I gotcha, that makes sense"

11-07-2019T22:10:20,SageSaga,many people go their entire lives without having a single ear infection
11-07-2019T22:10:21,Nekonny,Link to your comic Iorn?
11-07-2019T22:10:30,IronHorseComics,I bet sound to her is like sound to us when we're underwater
11-07-2019T22:10:49,SageSaga,that doesnt make sense
11-07-2019T22:11:40,SageSaga,what makes things sound weird underwater has nothing to do with the number of ears but just the medium sound is traveling through
11-07-2019T22:11:43,somewolfgirl,i get double ear infections like every year
11-07-2019T22:11:55,w0lfmare,I'll bet she hears things in 4 dimensions
11-07-2019T22:12:17,Sclimshady,"""I can hear time"""
11-07-2019T22:12:25,MuonNeutrino,"i'm sure it *was* weird at first for her given that i'm sure things sound much different through keidran ears than human ones, but she's gotta be used to it by now"
11-07-2019T22:12:38,IronHorseComics,"no Sage, I mean like how sound is amplified underwater"
11-07-2019T22:12:55,IronHorseComics,remember sound travels much faster in water than air
11-07-2019T22:13:12,Nekonny,it does?
11-07-2019T22:13:18,MuonNeutrino,yep
11-07-2019T22:13:27,Bgrmystr2,"If anything, it would probably sound exactly the same as normal, but I bet she might have better hearing out of the keidran ears"
11-07-2019T22:13:30,MuonNeutrino,"water is denser than air, so vibrations travel through it more quickly"
11-07-2019T22:13:30,SageSaga,true but it also muffles low tones which is why only high tones are heard from things like dophins and whales
11-07-2019T22:13:31,Bgrmystr2,due to the size
11-07-2019T22:14:03,SageSaga,and still- that doesnt change how you hear in air
11-07-2019T22:14:07,BadFoMo,She has the status efect you get when you mix RedBull with Morning Coffee. She can /see/ sound.
11-07-2019T22:14:16,MuonNeutrino,"well the large pinnae will of course collect more sound, but the actual sensing organs themselves are going to register sound differently as well"
11-07-2019T22:14:38,IronHorseComics,"her cat ears would logically be more sensitive to sound, she can probably hear a lot better than we can"
11-07-2019T22:14:53,MuonNeutrino,the way vibrations move through the ears depends sensitively on the exact geometry of the ear bones/etc
11-07-2019T22:15:05,SageSaga,only if her inner ears were catlike
11-07-2019T22:15:19,Bgrmystr2,"I don't recall if tom said anything about Keidran having better hearing than humans, or if it was the same"
11-07-2019T22:15:23,MuonNeutrino,"well, if those ears are functional at all she's gotta have the inner ears to go with them"
11-07-2019T22:15:32,MuonNeutrino,they're in the wrong place on her head for them to connect to her normal inner ears
11-07-2019T22:15:38,SageSaga,as far as you know she still has only her human ear drums so the only benefit she would get is like cupping you ear
11-07-2019T22:15:52,IronHorseComics,we don't know for sure
11-07-2019T22:15:59,MuonNeutrino,"tom's said both sets are functional, so the keidran ears have to have ear drums to go with them"
11-07-2019T22:16:10,SageSaga,that is not what that means
11-07-2019T22:16:11,Twokinds,I'm back!
11-07-2019T22:16:15,Bgrmystr2,Wb
11-07-2019T22:16:16,MarvTheHugPharaoh,wb tom
11-07-2019T22:16:22,Nekonny,"Ok, just ask tom then XD"
11-07-2019T22:16:25,MuonNeutrino,why *wouldn't* it be what it means? ears need ear drums to work
11-07-2019T22:16:28,NextGenAnubisKid,WB Tom ^^
11-07-2019T22:16:37,SageSaga,ears are just holes in your head!
11-07-2019T22:16:44,MuonNeutrino,with ear drums inside
11-07-2019T22:16:45,SageSaga,they can both lead to the same inner ear
11-07-2019T22:16:48,Nekonny,you don't hear though your nose
11-07-2019T22:16:53,MuonNeutrino,they're not in the right place on her head for that
11-07-2019T22:16:57,Bgrmystr2,I heard it with my own eyes! :V
11-07-2019T22:16:57,MuonNeutrino,they're too high up
11-07-2019T22:17:24,IronHorseComics,"in case you're wondering, Tom, we're trying to figure out just how good karen's hearing is to that of a normal person due to the cat ears"
11-07-2019T22:17:32,MuonNeutrino,your ear canal is slightly below the level of your eye
11-07-2019T22:17:54,somewolfgirl,she has spare ears! in case of a unfortunate  ear swabbing accident
11-07-2019T22:17:55,SageSaga,im well aware of human anatomy
11-07-2019T22:17:58,MuonNeutrino,"the keidran ears are way up high on the curve of her head, they can't connect to that"
11-07-2019T22:18:45,SageSaga,they are closer than you think- it would be easy to work out the logistics on it
11-07-2019T22:19:14,RyanReaper,And~ I‚Äôm back. And I New she‚Äôd get flustered!
11-07-2019T22:19:31,Tharkis,:ctharkis-earwiggle:
11-07-2019T22:19:40,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Tharkis
11-07-2019T22:19:47,SageSaga,and again- more ears would not make something sound underwater regardless
11-07-2019T22:19:52,MuonNeutrino,"it'd be a rather long connection, and either have to run just under the skin or through part of where her brain would normally be"
11-07-2019T22:20:03,Sclimshady,"Hi Tharkis, Love that pic fluff did for you"
11-07-2019T22:20:24,SageSaga,yo Tharkis
11-07-2019T22:20:26,Tharkis,Thanks!  Still shocked I got FK to doodle something
11-07-2019T22:20:39,BadFoMo,Yo.
11-07-2019T22:20:39,Tharkis,"Hey sage , hope you‚Äôre feeling better!"
11-07-2019T22:20:44,ZRO4825,"Oy, mates. '.'/"
11-07-2019T22:20:45,IronHorseComics,"or maybe there's magic portals in her hear that sends sound to her ear canals, we'll never know at this point"
11-07-2019T22:20:47,BadFoMo,Yo.
11-07-2019T22:20:58,ZRO4825,:czro4825-ViknAHH:

11-07-2019T22:22:15,ZRO4825,"Did you get any ice cream cake, Sage?"
11-07-2019T22:22:21,MuonNeutrino,meanwhile karen is as unflustered as always XD
11-07-2019T22:22:28,SageSaga,no Lann didnt give me money for any
11-07-2019T22:22:35,ZRO4825,"wth, Lann."

11-07-2019T22:25:07,ZRO4825,"I know, I was trying to think of it earlier cuz I was gonna be all awesome and send it to ya before stream, but then work happened D:"
11-07-2019T22:25:18,ZRO4825,"Have a good one, Tharkis!"

11-07-2019T22:25:51,BadFoMo,"Wait, if Karen's ears (on the same side) go to the same eardrum, does that mean that one could get a piece of string to go in one ear and come out the other?"
11-07-2019T22:26:03,ZRO4825,"I can agree with Sage on that. Haven't met him in person, but every interaction I've had with him has been a good one. ^_^"
11-07-2019T22:26:16,Tharkis,:ctharkis-aww:
11-07-2019T22:26:18,SageSaga,Bad- not before i crushed your skull
11-07-2019T22:26:22,FoxxTrotter,"G'night, Tharkis."

11-07-2019T22:26:41,ZRO4825,XD
11-07-2019T22:26:43,BadFoMo,What did I do?
11-07-2019T22:27:05,Sclimshady,Threatened the sweetie
11-07-2019T22:27:17,SageSaga,lets see how many rocks we can fit in BadFoMo's ears for our entertainment
11-07-2019T22:27:30,Sclimshady,:csagesaga-nynasmirk:
11-07-2019T22:27:36,BadFoMo,No! Don't do that!
11-07-2019T22:27:52,Mippy,Hello peeps
11-07-2019T22:27:55,BadFoMo,Yo.
11-07-2019T22:27:56,CrRAR,hey mippy
11-07-2019T22:27:59,MarvTheHugPharaoh,MIPPY!
11-07-2019T22:27:59,Bgrmystr2,because rocks equate to string.
11-07-2019T22:28:05,Sclimshady,Hiya Mippy
11-07-2019T22:28:06,SageSaga,so dont talk about trying to feed string into my Karen's ears
11-07-2019T22:28:27,BadFoMo,Sorry.
11-07-2019T22:28:27,IronHorseComics,this whole stream has gone mad
11-07-2019T22:28:39,Bgrmystr2,"no, everyone here who seems mad was already mad."
11-07-2019T22:28:45,Bgrmystr2,you're just now noticing it.
11-07-2019T22:28:56,ZRO4825,I am not mad! You are!
11-07-2019T22:28:58,Mippy,:ctwokinds-nibspartyhard:
11-07-2019T22:29:02,FoxxTrotter,Welcome to Wonderland. :0P
11-07-2019T22:29:03,Sclimshady,:ctwokinds-power:
11-07-2019T22:29:03,MarvTheHugPharaoh,This world's gone normal
11-07-2019T22:29:06,NextGenAnubisKid,So is this what the streams are  normally like then? XD
11-07-2019T22:29:06,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:ctwokinds-nibsdance:
11-07-2019T22:29:12,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-statuerawr:*[Someone mention ROCKS!?]

11-07-2019T22:29:22,FoxxTrotter,(Expect TGWonder isn't here. :0P)
11-07-2019T22:29:23,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock: n-no
11-07-2019T22:29:24,InTheLionsDen,:ctwokinds-nibsdance:
11-07-2019T22:29:29,FoxxTrotter,except*
11-07-2019T22:29:38,Bgrmystr2,"@Foxx he's not mad, he's fancy"
11-07-2019T22:29:46,FoxxTrotter,"Yes, I know."
11-07-2019T22:29:48,Bgrmystr2,the FANCIEST
11-07-2019T22:29:53,FoxxTrotter,A fancy DORK.
11-07-2019T22:30:09,Bgrmystr2,"perhaps, but that's not the important part."
11-07-2019T22:30:23,Mippy,Dorkus malorcus
11-07-2019T22:30:23,BadFoMo,...But I didn't mean for it to hurt her. It would be like how some people can get a string to go into their mouth and come out their nose.
11-07-2019T22:30:38,NextGenAnubisKid,"Yeeesh, I thought the 4th had passed. Someone's either shooting off fireworks or someone needs to get their engine serviced"
11-07-2019T22:30:55,IronHorseComics,don't want to waste perfectly good fireworks
11-07-2019T22:30:56,Bgrmystr2,"you'd have to go through the eardrum, Fomo"
11-07-2019T22:31:03,Bgrmystr2,which takes up the entire ear canal.
11-07-2019T22:31:07,Sclimshady,Everyday is freedom day!
11-07-2019T22:31:07,Nekonny,did someone mention TGwodner? XD
11-07-2019T22:31:10,NextGenAnubisKid,Least I hope it was fireworks
11-07-2019T22:31:24,NextGenAnubisKid,Got a notice on my apartment door today that crime was increasing in the area.
11-07-2019T22:31:38,BadFoMo,@Nekonny I've heard of them.
11-07-2019T22:31:49,FoxxTrotter,Wonder is a cool dude.
11-07-2019T22:31:56,Watsup,wonder is a dork :V
11-07-2019T22:32:03,ZRO4825,XD
11-07-2019T22:32:04,thestooge2222,*looks over at Nekonny's stream* GASP! more Paprika!?!? !!!JOY!!!
11-07-2019T22:32:07,FoxxTrotter,Yes...mentioned that. ;0P
11-07-2019T22:32:21,Sclimshady,Haven't watched many streams  but they seem cool
11-07-2019T22:32:33,SageSaga,Ron- why didnt anyone introduce me to the other people?
11-07-2019T22:32:47,Watsup,We were the other people :V
11-07-2019T22:32:53,Nekonny,HUm
11-07-2019T22:32:56,Nekonny,Um
11-07-2019T22:33:00,BadFoMo,@Bgrmystr2 I thought someone said that the Human ears and the Cat ears (on the same side could go to the same eardrum.)
11-07-2019T22:33:05,Nekonny,I'm really sorry T_T
11-07-2019T22:33:21,Nekonny,I would have don't it at the tables; but you were so far away from me
11-07-2019T22:33:28,SageSaga,people were sitting next to me at dinner and i had no idea who they were
11-07-2019T22:33:30,Watsup,Nekonny was trying to get bird advice and forgot :V
11-07-2019T22:33:32,Bgrmystr2,"it's a theory Fomo, but we don't know lol"
11-07-2019T22:33:34,Nekonny,but after the con at the zoo...
11-07-2019T22:33:41,RimaDraws,i would introduce people to you sage
11-07-2019T22:33:45,Nekonny,I'm not sure
11-07-2019T22:33:53,Nekonny,you were playing a game once
11-07-2019T22:33:57,Watsup,Was Sage at the zoo with us?
11-07-2019T22:33:58,Nekonny,and the other time
11-07-2019T22:33:58,SageSaga,there are now Katbox people who were at the con with me- and i never met them
11-07-2019T22:34:04,IronHorseComics,"oh lord, there's a scary thought, a furry con at a zoo"
11-07-2019T22:34:05,SageSaga,i was there
11-07-2019T22:34:06,Nekonny,was early on..
11-07-2019T22:34:15,Nekonny,"still though, I should have done that"
11-07-2019T22:34:18,Nekonny,I'm really sorry
11-07-2019T22:34:22,Watsup,There was a whole table of dorks Neko didn't introduce you to
11-07-2019T22:34:29,Watsup,the CT dev team and dork artists
11-07-2019T22:34:37,SageSaga,Id sat right next to me with these 3 other people and he never introduced me
11-07-2019T22:34:52,Watsup,He came to get advice on drawing proper cute bird anthros
11-07-2019T22:34:57,Nekonny,"yeah ^^"""
11-07-2019T22:35:05,Nekonny,I'm sorry sage

11-07-2019T22:36:24,Watsup,Jeso kept dropping all of his stuff while he was introducing himself and trying to shake hands
11-07-2019T22:36:26,Watsup,lol
11-07-2019T22:36:26,SageSaga,what we had was special!

11-07-2019T22:37:41,BadFoMo,"Sage: ""WHO WAS I SITTING NEXT TO?!"" ...I have been reminded of the song ""Who Was In My Room Last Night"" by ""The Butthole Surffers""."
11-07-2019T22:37:43,ZRO4825,Eat the potatoes Mippy. Don't be like Rieko.

11-07-2019T22:45:52,Mihari,Toyoko daki would be daki inception because she would have a Shiden Daki in her daki pose.

11-07-2019T22:58:48,IronHorseComics,no thanks
11-07-2019T22:58:58,ZRO4825,"What kinda hybrid, Sage? If you remember~  I've been looking around the hybrid market lately."
11-07-2019T22:59:08,Nekonny,I'm confused... Hybrid meant somethign else in brazil...
11-07-2019T22:59:12,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"we herd a BANG, and most of us were like ""What was that."" but my dad went 'HA"" and kept driving."
11-07-2019T22:59:13,SageSaga,not including the times were were all electric- its a 2012 prius
11-07-2019T22:59:20,CrRAR,lol
11-07-2019T22:59:26,Nekonny,there it was a car that could run on both gas and alcohol
11-07-2019T22:59:30,ZRO4825,"ahhh, damn, that's better MPG than I'd heard of those getting."
11-07-2019T22:59:31,SpazztasticKiwi,we‚Äôre all technically hybrids
11-07-2019T22:59:36,CrRAR,"If ya can keep driving, it's porbably not srs enough"
11-07-2019T22:59:45,MarvTheHugPharaoh,so now my sisters jeep doesn't have a hitch anymore
11-07-2019T22:59:49,PurpleLemons,that's a whole new meaning to drunk driving Neko
11-07-2019T22:59:50,Nekonny,so whats the hybrid mean in the states?
11-07-2019T22:59:55,Sclimshady,Hybrid just means two power sources Ron
11-07-2019T23:00:02,CrRAR,lol expected casualty
11-07-2019T23:00:02,Nekonny,so whats the other?
11-07-2019T23:00:04,SageSaga,Zro - taking easy roads up into the mountains and then going down hill saves a ton on Electric
11-07-2019T23:00:09,Sclimshady,Typically Gas/electric in the states
11-07-2019T23:00:22,Nekonny,so you charges your car sage?
11-07-2019T23:00:28,IronHorseComics,Hybrid: A car driven by super pretentious people who would rather save one tree than a hundred human lives
11-07-2019T23:00:37,IronHorseComics,"well, to me at least"
11-07-2019T23:00:41,Sclimshady,It charges itself Ron
11-07-2019T23:00:51,SageSaga,yeah while going down hill for long stretches we can throw it into Battery and it just charges as ya go
11-07-2019T23:01:04,CrRAR,"Yeah, not all hybrids require plugging-in"
11-07-2019T23:01:13,Nekonny,ah
11-07-2019T23:01:16,IronHorseComics,but that's just me as a guy who hates seeing its infestation into motorsports
11-07-2019T23:01:21,ZRO4825,"Yeah, I've been looking into the new Honda Insight, and it's a damned nice car. The idea of swapping to an automatic irks me though. :joy:"
11-07-2019T23:01:25,SpazztasticKiwi,"2019: where you can‚Äôt charge your phone when it dies cause your friend is charging his cigarette, your sisters charger is juicing her book, and the other outlets charging your damn car"
11-07-2019T23:01:25,Nekonny,not much use in Flat as F florida
11-07-2019T23:01:29,MarvTheHugPharaoh,If the hamster is still running then the car has power.
11-07-2019T23:01:30,Mippy,Jesus! I just googled it. I‚Äôd be paying over $1000CAD for a round trip to Pittsburgh. Goodbye dreams
11-07-2019T23:01:32,MatyMaty,"IronHorse, that's insane :P"
11-07-2019T23:01:35,Sclimshady,Manual till I die
11-07-2019T23:01:45,SageSaga,Electric Vehicles own gas
11-07-2019T23:01:49,MatyMaty,I live in a country were pollution due to cars is just out of control
11-07-2019T23:02:05,MatyMaty,you don't want to have to deal with that
11-07-2019T23:02:08,ZRO4825,"I agree Sclim, except I work a delivery job and that electric motor in-town is just TOO damned nice on gas prices."
11-07-2019T23:02:09,Sclimshady,The engine will also charge it Ron
11-07-2019T23:02:11,Twokinds,I can't wait until driving is a thing of the past.

11-07-2019T23:03:08,SageSaga,Ron- thats why you use folded space
11-07-2019T23:03:12,IronHorseComics,I'd be down for teleporting
11-07-2019T23:03:16,Mihari,I'd prefer full dive and showing up to virtual stuff myself *nods*
11-07-2019T23:03:21,AshnardSQRL,Howdy
11-07-2019T23:03:22,MatyMaty,"if teleporting exist, how long would it be for RL telefragging to exist? :P"
11-07-2019T23:03:25,Sclimshady,"Lol, nice"
11-07-2019T23:03:36,ZRO4825,"2 days, Maty, Tops."
11-07-2019T23:03:37,SageSaga,immediately Maty
11-07-2019T23:03:43,Nekonny,that teleporters are actually just fancy replicators/suicide booths
11-07-2019T23:03:45,SpazztasticKiwi,why teleport when you can be there with your imagination
11-07-2019T23:03:49,AshnardSQRL,"Oh snap, RWBY music :ptv-excited:"
11-07-2019T23:03:51,SageSaga,and im for Full Dive VR with Mihari
11-07-2019T23:04:02,PurpleLemons,Reminds me of the movie The Prestige Ron
11-07-2019T23:04:02,ZRO4825,omg yes please to full dive VR <3
11-07-2019T23:04:03,Mihari,Tom would never leave his house again!
11-07-2019T23:04:04,CrRAR,stupid quantum entanglement
11-07-2019T23:04:08,Nekonny,Full Dive VR?
11-07-2019T23:04:10,RimaDraws,i  just started to listen to rwby music
11-07-2019T23:04:11,MatyMaty,"that's really dark, Neko"
11-07-2019T23:04:11,SageSaga,like normal Tom!
11-07-2019T23:04:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom doesn‚Äôt leave his house now what are you talking about
11-07-2019T23:04:16,Sclimshady,I would full dive even if I knew i would be trapped
11-07-2019T23:04:25,Mihari,"I said again, he left for the con didn't he? :P"
11-07-2019T23:04:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe who knows that may have been a clone
11-07-2019T23:04:47,Mippy,^
11-07-2019T23:04:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Or a cardboard cut out
11-07-2019T23:04:48,SageSaga,Maty- it's true though- you tear something apart and put it back together- is it really you?
11-07-2019T23:04:50,IronHorseComics,you'd just be in that movie that was super ahead of it's time starring Silvestor Stallone
11-07-2019T23:05:00,SageSaga,thats why if you wanna teleport- Fold Space
11-07-2019T23:05:00,IronHorseComics,can't remember the name of it
11-07-2019T23:05:01,AshnardSQRL,Can I have full dive VR where ai can be my son's but everything looks 2D and stylized rather than like real life
11-07-2019T23:05:13,AshnardSQRL,My sona*
11-07-2019T23:05:21,SageSaga,of course

11-07-2019T23:05:28,MatyMaty,"Well I guess that can be applied to other stuff. If you transfer all of a brain's info into computer data, it is still the same?}"
11-07-2019T23:05:32,AshnardSQRL,Autocorrect on my tablet is irritating
11-07-2019T23:05:48,SageSaga,nah we cant be sure its not missing something
11-07-2019T23:06:04,Nekonny,theres a bunch a scientists that think thats what it basicly is
11-07-2019T23:06:05,Mippy,Ahü§î The Autocucumber
11-07-2019T23:06:07,BadFoMo,"I remember hearing about replicators/suicide booth teleportation while watching ""Oh Canada""."

11-07-2019T23:06:49,CrRAR,xD
11-07-2019T23:06:58,SageSaga,Full Dive though- i dont see why you wouldnt just have everything look however you want
11-07-2019T23:07:12,SageSaga,you can talk to people that see everyone as furries while they see anime characters
11-07-2019T23:07:20,Bgrmystr2,"Those commercials were dumb, Sclim. You're damn right we'd download a that."
11-07-2019T23:07:25,Bgrmystr2,whatever that was.
11-07-2019T23:07:49,Mippy,Replicator/suicide booth thing...yeah I know of that. It was brought up in a conversation I was having with my Dad about Star Trek
11-07-2019T23:07:55,Sclimshady,When cd movies came out
11-07-2019T23:08:21,IronHorseComics,aaaaaaaaaaaaaanyway
11-07-2019T23:08:26,ZRO4825,"That'd be hard to coordinate though, Sage. Like, how do you transfer someone's fursona intoa  proper anime character? What features transfer and what don't?"
11-07-2019T23:08:30,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-KatDance:

11-07-2019T23:08:54,w0lfmare,"Sage wants the full dive VR, but draws a comic about it going horribly wrong"
11-07-2019T23:08:57,SageSaga,you would assign people how you want them to look
11-07-2019T23:09:05,w0lfmare,Seems like tempting fate XD
11-07-2019T23:09:11,SageSaga,so i could make everyone i didnt care about look like Ron
11-07-2019T23:09:11,Sclimshady,lol

11-07-2019T23:10:41,AshnardSQRL,"I mean like, if any FullDive VR just had a ""2D Stylized"" filter option for all furry and anime and other characters, that'd be great"
11-07-2019T23:10:41,MatyMaty,Steve?

11-07-2019T23:15:55,Nekonny,it wasn't deep
11-07-2019T23:16:00,Mihari,^_^:
11-07-2019T23:16:16,Mihari,You don't know how shores and beaches work for someone lives in Florida.
11-07-2019T23:16:54,RisqueRaptor,Well it's gotta depend if said thing can swim and how far they are yeeted.
11-07-2019T23:17:00,Nekonny,cats can swim
11-07-2019T23:17:07,Sclimshady,Riptides

11-07-2019T23:17:17,MatyMaty,Can I link a thing?
11-07-2019T23:17:28,Mihari,I give up
11-07-2019T23:17:33,RisqueRaptor,Being swept by the tide is usually a death sentence .
11-07-2019T23:17:44,Mihari,Someone gets it atleast.
11-07-2019T23:17:45,RisqueRaptor,Like miles from the shores.
11-07-2019T23:17:58,MatyMaty,Yeah
11-07-2019T23:17:59,RisqueRaptor,The waves will pull you back like a force of a thousand waves.

11-07-2019T23:18:36,SteelDragonFist,I see the party is still rockin'
11-07-2019T23:18:39,Mihari,That's cause you didn't have the forsight to know that a dock that accepts cruiseliners should extend farther out XD
11-07-2019T23:18:39,RisqueRaptor,"Basically, don't take your chances straying too far from shore unless you're an athletic swimmer."
11-07-2019T23:18:54,Sclimshady,We have a beach with a 300 ft drop with crazy currents 50 ft from shore
11-07-2019T23:19:09,Mihari,and cats =/= human
11-07-2019T23:19:19,CrRAR,beach difficulty: expert
11-07-2019T23:19:19,Mihari,A lot easier for something we would shrug to seriously hurt them
11-07-2019T23:19:32,Sclimshady,It's called mortuary cove

11-07-2019T23:21:12,SageSaga,yeah you can link a think so long as you say what it is before the link and its sfw
11-07-2019T23:21:38,MatyMaty,"well Neko, you should have made a last panel with that Steve being led in cuffs into a police car"
11-07-2019T23:21:56,Nekonny,I can add that in
11-07-2019T23:22:00,ZoieFalcona,*dives in after them!*
11-07-2019T23:22:05,Nekonny,granted it's...5 years or so late
11-07-2019T23:22:11,MatyMaty,and it is just an Isekai cover Sage.

11-07-2019T23:23:07,SageSaga,that new Isekai with the guys Mother-
11-07-2019T23:23:09,SageSaga,is bad
11-07-2019T23:23:13,Mihari,"There were other reasons that followed for me to hate them, but I don't really remember anymore, the biggun was already done and damage done, so who cares."
11-07-2019T23:23:13,MatyMaty,I have to wonder though. Why it is always male human and elf bride? why never the other way around? :P
11-07-2019T23:23:29,Mihari,Cause elf female better?
11-07-2019T23:23:29,Bgrmystr2,"I was reading the manga, sage"
11-07-2019T23:23:39,Bgrmystr2,Haven't seen the anime
11-07-2019T23:23:40,Nekonny,what was I doing again?
11-07-2019T23:23:46,PurpleLemons,because male dominant market
11-07-2019T23:23:47,MatyMaty,male elves can be hot...
11-07-2019T23:23:56,Mihari,But not as hot as a female one can be :P
11-07-2019T23:23:57,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Like Legolas
11-07-2019T23:23:57,Nekonny,I saw LOTR
11-07-2019T23:23:59,PurpleLemons,and that way we can get more trash waifus
11-07-2019T23:24:04,Mihari,By large an far
