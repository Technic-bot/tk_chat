11-07-2019T14:52:19,CrimsonQuill,XD
11-07-2019T15:35:49,AspiringNoodle,I hate job postings -_-
11-07-2019T15:36:09,AspiringNoodle,They add so much damn fluff in the descriptions
11-07-2019T15:36:24,AspiringNoodle,Honestly makes me want to slap the people making the job postings. GET. DOWN. TO. ESSENTIALS.
11-07-2019T15:37:02,CrimsonQuill,I don't know if the beureacracy of the world would allow that...
11-07-2019T15:46:04,AspiringNoodle,Looking at a target job posting
11-07-2019T15:46:13,AspiringNoodle,It's for cashier / front of store attendant
11-07-2019T15:46:24,AspiringNoodle,Excuse me while I count out the number of bullet points on this page
11-07-2019T15:46:47,AspiringNoodle,34
11-07-2019T15:47:09,CrimsonQuill,Oh crumbs.
11-07-2019T15:49:30,AspiringNoodle,Now I remember why I procrastinate on this front
11-07-2019T15:49:44,AspiringNoodle,The pure levels of BS that are just thrown onto these pages...
11-07-2019T15:50:04,CrimsonQuill,I'm redrawing my art trade
11-07-2019T15:50:14,CrimsonQuill,I was dissatisfied because I rushed it.
11-07-2019T15:50:20,CrimsonQuill,I can draw better...and will.
11-07-2019T15:50:33,CrimsonQuill,And maybe even include a cameo of Halo Raine and my other OC....

11-07-2019T15:57:25,CrimsonQuill,Evening
11-07-2019T15:57:31,CrimsonQuill,:ptv-greetings::ctwokinds-nibrun:
11-07-2019T15:58:17,Bgrmystr2,Storm's gonna start hitting us hard around 8pm.. probably.
11-07-2019T15:58:22,Bgrmystr2,8 or 9pm
11-07-2019T15:58:30,Bgrmystr2,and 8pm is when the streams start for me.
11-07-2019T16:00:17,SpazztasticKiwi,“peekaboo mf” 🌧 ⛈🌧
11-07-2019T16:00:35,CrimsonQuill,Are you going to be ok Bgr?
11-07-2019T16:00:42,CrimsonQuill,"Also, evenign Spazztastic!"
11-07-2019T16:02:05,Bgrmystr2,lol no worries we'll prolly lose power and I'll miss the streams on Fri and maybe sunday. But that's just to be expected.
11-07-2019T16:02:20,Bgrmystr2,"There may be tornados so I dunno about those, unpredictable bastards, them."
11-07-2019T16:02:34,CrimsonQuill,I hope you'll be able to make Sunday...
11-07-2019T16:02:46,CrimsonQuill,"Also, Tornadoes? Uh oh."
11-07-2019T16:02:54,CrimsonQuill,Those are nasty buggers.
11-07-2019T16:03:06,CrimsonQuill,I've seen countless videos.
11-07-2019T16:03:09,Bgrmystr2,The rain making the levees fail is probably the only thing I'm worried about :ocean: :house_with_garden:
11-07-2019T16:05:27,CrimsonQuill,Are you likely to be flooded?
11-07-2019T16:06:41,Bgrmystr2,"We do not live in a flood zone, but just with the very little it dropped we had about 1 1/2 foot of water in our street"
11-07-2019T16:07:00,Bgrmystr2,it only dropped bout 6ish inches? or so before going into the gulf
11-07-2019T16:08:04,Bgrmystr2,"flooding may or may not be an issue, more likely to not be the case, but since I live within walking distance of a levee, if it fails, there's more than enough water to wash the whole neighborhood away."
11-07-2019T16:08:34,Bgrmystr2,so it's just a matter of whether it will or not.
11-07-2019T16:09:25,CrimsonQuill,...That sounds very bad.
11-07-2019T16:09:43,Bgrmystr2,yeh well.. wasn't my choice to live in this house.
11-07-2019T16:09:48,CrimsonQuill,I'm surprised that you're not panicking...I would.
11-07-2019T16:10:04,CrimsonQuill,"Then again, I don't have a very level head on my shoulders..."
11-07-2019T16:10:07,Bgrmystr2,"it's unsettling, but I ain't 13."
11-07-2019T16:10:18,Bgrmystr2,I've gone through this several times prior
11-07-2019T16:10:53,Bgrmystr2,"panicing doesn't help anything, only makes it worse"
11-07-2019T16:12:28,CrimsonQuill,True.
11-07-2019T16:12:42,CrimsonQuill,"Well, I really hope that you'll make it through alright."
11-07-2019T16:12:49,CrimsonQuill,And that the levees hold for everyone.
11-07-2019T16:13:03,CrimsonQuill,I hope no one gets flooded.
11-07-2019T16:13:58,Bgrmystr2,"yeah same, but its only a matter of time."
11-07-2019T16:14:10,Bgrmystr2,they were never made to handle that level of water
11-07-2019T16:14:44,CrimsonQuill,How long will those storms continue for?
11-07-2019T16:15:14,Bgrmystr2,"this one's slow, so it's been extending the length of time it'll likely stay over the area"
11-07-2019T16:15:33,CrimsonQuill,So more flood risk as it passes over.
11-07-2019T16:16:01,Bgrmystr2,We already had flood risk when it passed over the first time and the flooding is still there in some places far as I'm aware
11-07-2019T16:16:13,Bgrmystr2,and that's just going to stack on top of what's already there
11-07-2019T16:16:16,CrimsonQuill,Oof.
11-07-2019T16:16:46,Bgrmystr2,apparently as much as 20 inches according to one article on Vox as of this time yesterday
11-07-2019T16:17:14,Bgrmystr2,"the river's expected to rise bout 19 or 20 foot by the weekend, which is the height of the city's levees."
11-07-2019T16:17:27,CrimsonQuill,"Not good,"
11-07-2019T16:17:31,CrimsonQuill,So...
11-07-2019T16:17:43,CrimsonQuill,Are there evacuation plans should the worst happen?
11-07-2019T16:18:15,Bgrmystr2,"nope, they told us to stay home and take shelter here"
11-07-2019T16:18:18,Bgrmystr2,:U
11-07-2019T16:18:43,CrimsonQuill,"...It doesn't appear to be the best option, if you ask me."
11-07-2019T16:18:51,Bgrmystr2,no kidding
11-07-2019T16:19:13,Bgrmystr2,"but they've said noone should be driving past 8pm. not sure if curfew due to storm / flooding or what, but"
11-07-2019T16:19:17,Bgrmystr2,just what I was told
11-07-2019T16:19:45,Bgrmystr2,This is the forcast so far. https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/storm_graphics/AT02/refresh/AL022019_key_messages+png/204123_key_messages_sm.png
11-07-2019T16:20:17,Bgrmystr2,"It's basically going to be right on top when the streams start so that's cool. and it'll be here all friday night, and probably all saturday morning.."
11-07-2019T16:20:39,Bgrmystr2,just dumping rain.
11-07-2019T16:20:54,CrimsonQuill,...How much of your stuff can you make sure is dry if it floods?
11-07-2019T16:21:31,Bgrmystr2,ehh well.. I kind of don't have many places other than putting stuff on top my bed or desk
11-07-2019T16:21:50,CrimsonQuill,:ctwokinds-keithdotdotdot:
11-07-2019T16:22:01,Bgrmystr2,a lot of my stuff is electronics in boxes on shelves
11-07-2019T16:22:17,Bgrmystr2,"so if the house floods, there's not much I can do."
11-07-2019T16:22:45,CrimsonQuill,...I just don't know what to say...
11-07-2019T16:23:28,Bgrmystr2,¯\_(ツ)_/¯ hope it doesn't flood and save what can't be replaced with insurance money.
11-07-2019T16:23:43,Bgrmystr2,prolly about what I'd say.
11-07-2019T16:23:58,CrimsonQuill,Yeah...please God.
11-07-2019T16:24:06,Bgrmystr2,it'll likely be fine
11-07-2019T16:24:20,Bgrmystr2,but I ain't no crystal ball.
11-07-2019T16:24:21,CrimsonQuill,"Jeepers, I'm worried about a flood thousands of miles over the Atlantic ocean..."
11-07-2019T16:24:25,Bgrmystr2,haha
11-07-2019T16:24:33,CrimsonQuill,When I have exams in 5 weeks....
11-07-2019T16:24:45,CrimsonQuill,And it's 10:25pm. XD
11-07-2019T16:25:12,SpazztasticKiwi,invest in the sealing powers of Irish doors
11-07-2019T16:25:21,SpazztasticKiwi,they don’t fuk about
11-07-2019T16:25:30,CrimsonQuill,"Heh, not all of them are sealed, trust me."
11-07-2019T16:25:33,CrimsonQuill,Same in the UK.
11-07-2019T16:25:57,CrimsonQuill,"Actually, Spazz, why 'Irish' doors? Because of the rain?"
11-07-2019T16:26:11,CrimsonQuill,Just curious.
11-07-2019T16:26:25,Bgrmystr2,lol do irish windows exist
11-07-2019T16:26:26,Bgrmystr2,and walls?
11-07-2019T16:26:28,Bgrmystr2,:V
11-07-2019T16:26:31,Bgrmystr2,cuz that'd be great too

11-07-2019T16:27:59,CrimsonQuill,"True-Cork is hit by nasty floods, sometimes, and houses are destroyed...or you get those doors."
11-07-2019T16:28:10,CrimsonQuill,Proven to handle the flooding of the river Lee.
11-07-2019T16:28:14,CrimsonQuill,Now coming to Wisconsin
11-07-2019T16:28:50,Bgrmystr2,lol well then
11-07-2019T16:29:33,Bgrmystr2,"to be fair, Ireland doesn't get wind gusts that can quite literally crack your door in half because fuck breaking the hinges."
11-07-2019T16:29:58,Bgrmystr2,"happened to my dad's front door after Katrina, and that was a bigass hardwood door."
11-07-2019T16:30:01,CrimsonQuill,"Weeelll...on the West coast, I have heard of the odd nasty storm doing just that..."
11-07-2019T16:30:10,CrimsonQuill,And Storm Ophelia was really nasty.
11-07-2019T16:32:03,SpazztasticKiwi,mother nature sees you use her dead children and replies with backhand
11-07-2019T16:32:17,Bgrmystr2,xD
11-07-2019T16:41:06,CrimsonQuill,Weeeeellll...
11-07-2019T16:41:13,CrimsonQuill,I need to go to bed.

11-07-2019T17:17:15,IronHorseComics,"yes, yes it does"
11-07-2019T17:20:11,AspiringNoodle,"I've been thinking, how long before we have a full-blown job crisis?"
11-07-2019T17:20:25,TerraTheWizard,10 years
11-07-2019T17:20:28,AspiringNoodle,Companies are becoming less and less willing to train new hires
11-07-2019T17:20:47,TerraTheWizard,i've been stuck looking for a job for 2 years
11-07-2019T17:20:51,AspiringNoodle,Job descriptions are getting fucking ridiculous (note my earlier complaint about a fucking TARGET application with 34 bullet points total)
11-07-2019T17:21:42,TerraTheWizard,"""just get a job in retail, that's how everyone starts"""
11-07-2019T17:21:50,TerraTheWizard,can't get past pre-screening
11-07-2019T17:21:55,IronHorseComics,"no, everyone starts in a warehouse job"
11-07-2019T17:22:18,IronHorseComics,"well not me, my first job was for an auto body shop"
11-07-2019T17:22:29,AspiringNoodle,"I have a degree in computer science, and I look at fucking retail jobs and am like... ""Do you want a damned manager or something?"""
11-07-2019T17:22:49,TerraTheWizard,i failed a degree in software engineering
11-07-2019T17:22:59,AspiringNoodle,"It's like, every job posting I look at wants you to have literally every possible skill that could ever just *maybe* show up at some point"
11-07-2019T17:23:23,TerraTheWizard,"""we don't want to train you, but we also don't want to pay you either"""
11-07-2019T17:23:45,AspiringNoodle,There's that long runningj oke about the number of years required to get a job going up
11-07-2019T17:23:49,AspiringNoodle,But it is going up
11-07-2019T17:23:58,AspiringNoodle,"And it's on over half of all ""entry-level"" positions"
11-07-2019T17:24:07,TerraTheWizard,also the fact jobs will take 16-18y/o's because they can pay them half minimum wage
11-07-2019T17:24:16,IronHorseComics,these companies want old people who are close to retiring so that they don't have to pay them decent money
11-07-2019T17:24:43,TerraTheWizard,i'm trying to get on an apprenticeship
11-07-2019T17:24:56,TerraTheWizard,but i've cornered myself in a way that i always end up doing
11-07-2019T17:25:00,AspiringNoodle,I'm glad I'm able to live with my parents
11-07-2019T17:25:16,TerraTheWizard,"i'm too qualified for the ones i want to do, but underqualified for the end job"
11-07-2019T17:25:16,AspiringNoodle,"They've mentioned that they expected this to probably happen, given the economy"
11-07-2019T17:25:44,AspiringNoodle,And I've been beating myself up because I consider it a failure on my end to mature into a responsible adult
11-07-2019T17:26:00,AspiringNoodle,"But jfc, these job postings"
11-07-2019T17:26:21,TerraTheWizard,so i was looking for certain jobs near me
11-07-2019T17:26:31,TerraTheWizard,nearest position was over 50 miles away
11-07-2019T17:26:33,AspiringNoodle,"""entry-level"" apparently doesn't exist anymore.  And the only people who can get them straight out of college are the prodigies who were doing shit like that in their spare time / for fun"
11-07-2019T17:27:37,TerraTheWizard,"it's starting to feel like it's ""figure out a way to become self-employed, or perish"""
11-07-2019T17:27:56,IronHorseComics,"when I was graduating college three years ago, I was encouraged to pursue local print shops"
11-07-2019T17:28:02,AspiringNoodle,"It's no wonder socialism is on the rise in America, the system is getting lazy / greedy and putting the pressure on the newer generations"

11-07-2019T17:28:41,TerraTheWizard,"also from friends, those old people bully the new people out of the jobs"
11-07-2019T17:29:06,TerraTheWizard,"make the conditions hell, then use your friends in hr to fire you"
11-07-2019T17:29:13,AspiringNoodle,"There was a time in America where out of high school you'd get a job, you'd make your way up, you'd make a middle-class wage and be able to support a family on ONE working spouse"

11-07-2019T17:29:28,AspiringNoodle,"And on top of all that, you'd work 40 hours a week, tops"
11-07-2019T17:29:42,IronHorseComics,that was when people couldn't afford to go to college
11-07-2019T17:29:42,AspiringNoodle,"Now, both spouses need to work"
11-07-2019T17:29:53,AspiringNoodle,It's likely they'll work 50 hours minimum
11-07-2019T17:29:58,Bgrmystr2,"yeah noodle, pity even when both work, it's still not enough for the cheapest apartments :/"
11-07-2019T17:30:04,AspiringNoodle,Overtime / crunch is likely
11-07-2019T17:30:24,AspiringNoodle,AND they need to pursue learning in their spare time to develop the skills that will get them hired in the first place

11-07-2019T17:31:12,IronHorseComics,"oh that's nothing, when I was job searching all the decent graphic design positions wanted 5 years AND a bachelors"
11-07-2019T17:31:18,Bgrmystr2,10/10 no wonder everyone doesn't have jobs
11-07-2019T17:31:21,AspiringNoodle,I look at Robert Kotick (Activision-Blizzard CEO) as one of the best examples of everything wrong
11-07-2019T17:31:46,AspiringNoodle,That fatass makes 30M a year in salary and bonuses / stock options

11-07-2019T17:35:05,TerraTheWizard,now looking at code gives me an anxiety attack
11-07-2019T17:35:42,AspiringNoodle,"Also, don't get me started on all the different kinds of code that exists..."

11-07-2019T17:37:03,AspiringNoodle,Forgot about python

11-07-2019T17:37:42,AspiringNoodle,I love looking at job postings where they want you to know like 5 different languages
11-07-2019T17:37:58,AspiringNoodle,"Like... the fuck.  If your company is using 5+ programming languages, how the hell do you get anything done?!?"

11-07-2019T17:38:34,TerraTheWizard,if i could get paid for spelling/grammar checking job listings that'd be great

11-07-2019T17:38:49,TerraTheWizard,i've seen enough of them
11-07-2019T17:39:12,AspiringNoodle,Some people suggest I do stuff related to tech xD
11-07-2019T17:39:21,AspiringNoodle,I've done enough research into computer hardware
11-07-2019T17:39:22,IronHorseComics,"actually Terra, there is"

11-07-2019T17:44:46,AspiringNoodle,"Suddenly, my obsession with art / animation makes sense"
11-07-2019T17:45:02,AspiringNoodle,It's nearly impossible to make a convoluted job posting
11-07-2019T17:45:32,AspiringNoodle,"Well, unless you think Adobe Illustrator is actually for illustrators :ptv-snicker:"
11-07-2019T17:48:19,IronHorseComics,the strange thing is that I keep seeing people who DO use illustrator for illustrations
11-07-2019T17:48:25,IronHorseComics,it boggles my mind
11-07-2019T17:49:02,AspiringNoodle,"You *can*, but it's really not suited for illustration as a whole"
11-07-2019T17:49:13,Bgrmystr2,"seems silly that you wouldn't illustrate with a program called ""Illustrator"""
11-07-2019T17:49:26,Bgrmystr2,"so yes I would expect people to do so, but"
11-07-2019T17:49:30,Bgrmystr2,I know nothing of it so :V
11-07-2019T17:49:38,Bgrmystr2,I kinda don't really know nor care either way lol
11-07-2019T17:49:46,AspiringNoodle,"Well, just like you hate ""young people"" coming up with new terminology, illustrators hate Adobe for naming that program Illustrator"
11-07-2019T17:50:02,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
11-07-2019T17:50:09,IronHorseComics,"yeah, it's meant specifically for graphic design"
11-07-2019T17:50:14,AspiringNoodle,That program is meant for graphic design because it uses vectors
11-07-2019T17:50:28,TerraTheWizard,i knew someone who drew whole comics in illustrator
11-07-2019T17:50:36,AspiringNoodle,Absolute mad lad
11-07-2019T17:50:57,TerraTheWizard,think they use clip studio these days
11-07-2019T17:51:20,IronHorseComics,a lot of comic artists use it because of the vector line art
11-07-2019T17:51:41,IronHorseComics,if I figured out what they were doing to make it look good I'd do the same
11-07-2019T17:51:50,IronHorseComics,*a lot of professional
11-07-2019T17:53:32,AspiringNoodle,I think I'll stick with the more traditional raster approach :p
11-07-2019T17:53:38,AspiringNoodle,Just make massive 300 dpi files <3
11-07-2019T17:54:35,IronHorseComics,"I've been using clip studio for panel setup and lineart, works alright to me"
11-07-2019T17:54:57,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
11-07-2019T17:55:12,IronHorseComics,but everything else I do in photoshop (is booed and has shoes thrown at) because I can do quite a lot more with it
11-07-2019T18:17:20,IronHorseComics,"well now I've done it... found a very good traditional painter on youtube, now I feel inadequate, so par for the course"
11-07-2019T19:03:31,AspiringNoodle,"Don't look up sakimichan then, lol"
11-07-2019T19:03:50,IronHorseComics,wrong painter

11-07-2019T20:58:22,Bgrmystr2,Gladly. I don't want 20 inches of water on an already flooded river.
11-07-2019T20:58:25,IronHorseComics,"not sure mine would be uplifting advise but it's not a ""give up"" kind of thing"

11-07-2019T20:58:48,NextGenAnubisKid,I'd say just advertise on all the relevant sites?
11-07-2019T20:58:50,RimaDraws,lol
11-07-2019T20:58:58,SpazztasticKiwi,mother got me at Walmart looking for Stye. google says it’s an eye condition
11-07-2019T20:59:10,SpazztasticKiwi,I know You can get anything at Walmart but this is ridiculous
11-07-2019T20:59:13,Bgrmystr2,is there like a dance to stop the rain? Or should I do like.. the opposite of dancing?
11-07-2019T20:59:21,Bgrmystr2,is there an opposite?
11-07-2019T20:59:26,RimaDraws,sun dance
11-07-2019T20:59:44,Bgrmystr2,oo.... ehh.. I dunno if I like the sound of that.
11-07-2019T20:59:58,BadFoMo,"@IronHorseComics Ok, lets hear it."
11-07-2019T21:00:02,IronHorseComics,just don't flip off the storm clouds... you make yourself a lightning rod that way
11-07-2019T21:00:08,SpazztasticKiwi,just go tell the rain to feck off
11-07-2019T21:00:33,Bgrmystr2,it'll blow rain in my face.
11-07-2019T21:00:35,Nekonny,rain waters the planes ^^'
11-07-2019T21:00:35,BadFoMo,"@NextGenAnubisKid So, here before the streams start?"

11-07-2019T21:00:59,Nekonny,If I may
11-07-2019T21:01:05,Bgrmystr2,I don't think planes need water. They drink fuel. :thinking:

11-07-2019T21:01:44,BadFoMo,I like animations.
11-07-2019T21:01:54,IronHorseComics,"okay, you asked for it my advise from personal experience is: expect no one to show up, it'll be a lot less disappointing to see no one but more uplifting if people DO show up"
11-07-2019T21:02:13,Bgrmystr2,would agree w/ iron on that
11-07-2019T21:02:24,Nekonny,you'll need audio though XD
11-07-2019T21:02:30,Sclimshady,Small streams are fun Iron

11-07-2019T21:18:48,LannAF,gah I wanna play dnd so badly.
11-07-2019T21:19:03,LannAF,I was fiddling around with the character creator in barotrauma since kame wanted to make anthro characters
11-07-2019T21:19:05,NextGenAnubisKid,I know that feel. I play tomorrow with my normal group. XD
11-07-2019T21:19:10,LannAF,It...Actually seems fairly feasible.
11-07-2019T21:19:20,LannAF,like much easier than I thought it'd be
11-07-2019T21:19:28,NextGenAnubisKid,Oh yeah definitely. I've done that before.
11-07-2019T21:19:34,MarvTheHugPharaoh,You gotta teach me how to do that.
11-07-2019T21:19:41,NextGenAnubisKid,Plenty of material out there for that.
11-07-2019T21:19:56,LannAF,You can't actually create them fully atm unless the devs unlock the humanoid setting.
11-07-2019T21:20:16,NextGenAnubisKid,...oh are you talking the specific character creator you use?
11-07-2019T21:20:22,LannAF,Yes. We're talking about Barotrauma.
11-07-2019T21:20:29,NextGenAnubisKid,I thought you were talking D&D in general. XD
11-07-2019T21:20:30,NextGenAnubisKid,My bad
11-07-2019T21:20:37,LannAF,"No worries, I kinda segwayed that."

11-07-2019T21:21:00,LannAF,I'm terrified at the prospect Kame wants to make giant monster girl creatures though.
11-07-2019T21:21:11,w0lfmare,As am I
11-07-2019T21:21:22,Sclimshady,"Im terrified, but turned on as well"

11-07-2019T21:21:36,ZahnHolley,Kinky...
11-07-2019T21:21:37,LannAF,"Because Tom suggested giving them huge ""ballasts"" and I think I'm we're all going to regret that idea."

11-07-2019T21:21:57,Sclimshady,I like big ballasts
11-07-2019T21:22:00,LannAF,There's already a monster that does 0 damage statistically
11-07-2019T21:22:08,LannAF,The damage is purely from transferring kinetic energy
11-07-2019T21:22:18,LannAF,".....Which makes it WAY more dangerous than even the most dangerous enemy, surprisingly."
11-07-2019T21:22:29,RyanReaper,I feel like Maddie would be flustered at the naked dude in front of her.
11-07-2019T21:22:40,NextGenAnubisKid,How does that work Lann?

11-07-2019T21:23:28,RyanReaper,Heh true.
11-07-2019T21:23:30,CrRAR,*Wolfo used wolfish charm*
11-07-2019T21:23:38,CrRAR,*It's not very effective*
11-07-2019T21:23:42,MuonNeutrino,"also in that panel given that his head is at a lower height than hers even though he's gotta be taller than her, he's presumably not stood up yet"
11-07-2019T21:24:00,MuonNeutrino,"if she's going to get flustered, it'd probably be *after* he stands up >.>"
11-07-2019T21:24:22,BadFoMo,He's a Keidran; nudity is the norm for their kind.
11-07-2019T21:24:38,MuonNeutrino,"well, obviously *he* doesn't care"
11-07-2019T21:24:43,MuonNeutrino,maddie might be a bit perturbed tho
11-07-2019T21:24:46,RyanReaper,"Yeah to the left in the “ab” shot, she’s just lettin it free XD"

11-07-2019T21:25:27,LannAF,"Instead of biting or smacking, it just rams stuff./"

11-07-2019T21:25:52,RyanReaper,"Bastins aren’t used to the nudity X) she got all flustered at Nibs when she went Keidran, but maybe that’s just cuz she looked like a bastin (at least that’s what she said)"
11-07-2019T21:25:55,LannAF,Kinetic force destroys walls and jostles everybody in the submarine. They get stunned and hurt even if the monster isn't hitting their side.
11-07-2019T21:26:06,CrRAR,lol
11-07-2019T21:26:07,NextGenAnubisKid,"Ah yeah I gotcha, that makes sense"

11-07-2019T22:06:02,Nekonny,or even a main that just visits for a short time
11-07-2019T22:06:52,Nekonny,the character is meant to be a representative of the artist after all
11-07-2019T22:07:02,IronHorseComics,"I was just wondering which character I should volunteer is I got to, one of the main characters or one of their friends that sort of thing"

11-07-2019T22:10:21,Nekonny,Link to your comic Iorn?
11-07-2019T22:10:30,IronHorseComics,I bet sound to her is like sound to us when we're underwater
11-07-2019T22:10:49,SageSaga,that doesnt make sense
11-07-2019T22:11:40,SageSaga,what makes things sound weird underwater has nothing to do with the number of ears but just the medium sound is traveling through
11-07-2019T22:11:43,somewolfgirl,i get double ear infections like every year
11-07-2019T22:11:55,w0lfmare,I'll bet she hears things in 4 dimensions
11-07-2019T22:12:17,Sclimshady,"""I can hear time"""
11-07-2019T22:12:25,MuonNeutrino,"i'm sure it *was* weird at first for her given that i'm sure things sound much different through keidran ears than human ones, but she's gotta be used to it by now"
11-07-2019T22:12:38,IronHorseComics,"no Sage, I mean like how sound is amplified underwater"
11-07-2019T22:12:55,IronHorseComics,remember sound travels much faster in water than air
11-07-2019T22:13:12,Nekonny,it does?
11-07-2019T22:13:18,MuonNeutrino,yep
11-07-2019T22:13:27,Bgrmystr2,"If anything, it would probably sound exactly the same as normal, but I bet she might have better hearing out of the keidran ears"
11-07-2019T22:13:30,MuonNeutrino,"water is denser than air, so vibrations travel through it more quickly"
11-07-2019T22:13:30,SageSaga,true but it also muffles low tones which is why only high tones are heard from things like dophins and whales
11-07-2019T22:13:31,Bgrmystr2,due to the size
11-07-2019T22:14:03,SageSaga,and still- that doesnt change how you hear in air
11-07-2019T22:14:07,BadFoMo,She has the status efect you get when you mix RedBull with Morning Coffee. She can /see/ sound.
11-07-2019T22:14:16,MuonNeutrino,"well the large pinnae will of course collect more sound, but the actual sensing organs themselves are going to register sound differently as well"
11-07-2019T22:14:38,IronHorseComics,"her cat ears would logically be more sensitive to sound, she can probably hear a lot better than we can"
11-07-2019T22:14:53,MuonNeutrino,the way vibrations move through the ears depends sensitively on the exact geometry of the ear bones/etc
11-07-2019T22:15:05,SageSaga,only if her inner ears were catlike
11-07-2019T22:15:19,Bgrmystr2,"I don't recall if tom said anything about Keidran having better hearing than humans, or if it was the same"
11-07-2019T22:15:23,MuonNeutrino,"well, if those ears are functional at all she's gotta have the inner ears to go with them"
11-07-2019T22:15:32,MuonNeutrino,they're in the wrong place on her head for them to connect to her normal inner ears
11-07-2019T22:15:38,SageSaga,as far as you know she still has only her human ear drums so the only benefit she would get is like cupping you ear
11-07-2019T22:15:52,IronHorseComics,we don't know for sure
11-07-2019T22:15:59,MuonNeutrino,"tom's said both sets are functional, so the keidran ears have to have ear drums to go with them"
11-07-2019T22:16:10,SageSaga,that is not what that means
11-07-2019T22:16:11,Twokinds,I'm back!
11-07-2019T22:16:15,Bgrmystr2,Wb
11-07-2019T22:16:16,MarvTheHugPharaoh,wb tom
11-07-2019T22:16:22,Nekonny,"Ok, just ask tom then XD"
11-07-2019T22:16:25,MuonNeutrino,why *wouldn't* it be what it means? ears need ear drums to work
11-07-2019T22:16:28,NextGenAnubisKid,WB Tom ^^
11-07-2019T22:16:37,SageSaga,ears are just holes in your head!
11-07-2019T22:16:44,MuonNeutrino,with ear drums inside
11-07-2019T22:16:45,SageSaga,they can both lead to the same inner ear
11-07-2019T22:16:48,Nekonny,you don't hear though your nose
11-07-2019T22:16:53,MuonNeutrino,they're not in the right place on her head for that
11-07-2019T22:16:57,Bgrmystr2,I heard it with my own eyes! :V
11-07-2019T22:16:57,MuonNeutrino,they're too high up
11-07-2019T22:17:24,IronHorseComics,"in case you're wondering, Tom, we're trying to figure out just how good karen's hearing is to that of a normal person due to the cat ears"
11-07-2019T22:17:32,MuonNeutrino,your ear canal is slightly below the level of your eye
11-07-2019T22:17:54,somewolfgirl,she has spare ears! in case of a unfortunate  ear swabbing accident
11-07-2019T22:17:55,SageSaga,im well aware of human anatomy
11-07-2019T22:17:58,MuonNeutrino,"the keidran ears are way up high on the curve of her head, they can't connect to that"
11-07-2019T22:18:45,SageSaga,they are closer than you think- it would be easy to work out the logistics on it
11-07-2019T22:19:14,RyanReaper,And~ I’m back. And I New she’d get flustered!
11-07-2019T22:19:31,Tharkis,:ctharkis-earwiggle:
11-07-2019T22:19:40,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Tharkis
11-07-2019T22:19:47,SageSaga,and again- more ears would not make something sound underwater regardless
11-07-2019T22:19:52,MuonNeutrino,"it'd be a rather long connection, and either have to run just under the skin or through part of where her brain would normally be"
11-07-2019T22:20:03,Sclimshady,"Hi Tharkis, Love that pic fluff did for you"
11-07-2019T22:20:24,SageSaga,yo Tharkis
11-07-2019T22:20:26,Tharkis,Thanks!  Still shocked I got FK to doodle something
11-07-2019T22:20:39,BadFoMo,Yo.
11-07-2019T22:20:39,Tharkis,"Hey sage , hope you’re feeling better!"
11-07-2019T22:20:44,ZRO4825,"Oy, mates. '.'/"
11-07-2019T22:20:45,IronHorseComics,"or maybe there's magic portals in her hear that sends sound to her ear canals, we'll never know at this point"
11-07-2019T22:20:47,BadFoMo,Yo.
11-07-2019T22:20:58,ZRO4825,:czro4825-ViknAHH:

11-07-2019T22:22:15,ZRO4825,"Did you get any ice cream cake, Sage?"
11-07-2019T22:22:21,MuonNeutrino,meanwhile karen is as unflustered as always XD
11-07-2019T22:22:28,SageSaga,no Lann didnt give me money for any
11-07-2019T22:22:35,ZRO4825,"wth, Lann."

11-07-2019T22:25:07,ZRO4825,"I know, I was trying to think of it earlier cuz I was gonna be all awesome and send it to ya before stream, but then work happened D:"
11-07-2019T22:25:18,ZRO4825,"Have a good one, Tharkis!"

11-07-2019T22:25:50,MarvTheHugPharaoh,see ya tharkis
11-07-2019T22:25:51,BadFoMo,"Wait, if Karen's ears (on the same side) go to the same eardrum, does that mean that one could get a piece of string to go in one ear and come out the other?"
11-07-2019T22:26:03,ZRO4825,"I can agree with Sage on that. Haven't met him in person, but every interaction I've had with him has been a good one. ^_^"
11-07-2019T22:26:16,Tharkis,:ctharkis-aww:
11-07-2019T22:26:18,SageSaga,Bad- not before i crushed your skull
11-07-2019T22:26:22,FoxxTrotter,"G'night, Tharkis."

11-07-2019T22:26:35,NextGenAnubisKid,"Take care Tharkis! Am new here, hope to chat with ya more! ^^"
11-07-2019T22:26:41,ZRO4825,XD
11-07-2019T22:26:43,BadFoMo,What did I do?
11-07-2019T22:27:05,Sclimshady,Threatened the sweetie
11-07-2019T22:27:17,SageSaga,lets see how many rocks we can fit in BadFoMo's ears for our entertainment
11-07-2019T22:27:30,Sclimshady,:csagesaga-nynasmirk:
11-07-2019T22:27:36,BadFoMo,No! Don't do that!
11-07-2019T22:27:52,Mippy,Hello peeps
11-07-2019T22:27:55,BadFoMo,Yo.
11-07-2019T22:27:56,CrRAR,hey mippy
11-07-2019T22:27:59,MarvTheHugPharaoh,MIPPY!
11-07-2019T22:27:59,Bgrmystr2,because rocks equate to string.
11-07-2019T22:28:05,Sclimshady,Hiya Mippy
11-07-2019T22:28:06,SageSaga,so dont talk about trying to feed string into my Karen's ears
11-07-2019T22:28:27,BadFoMo,Sorry.
11-07-2019T22:28:27,IronHorseComics,this whole stream has gone mad
11-07-2019T22:28:39,Bgrmystr2,"no, everyone here who seems mad was already mad."
11-07-2019T22:28:45,Bgrmystr2,you're just now noticing it.
11-07-2019T22:28:56,ZRO4825,I am not mad! You are!
11-07-2019T22:28:58,Mippy,:ctwokinds-nibspartyhard:
11-07-2019T22:29:02,FoxxTrotter,Welcome to Wonderland. :0P
11-07-2019T22:29:03,Sclimshady,:ctwokinds-power:
11-07-2019T22:29:03,MarvTheHugPharaoh,This world's gone normal
11-07-2019T22:29:06,NextGenAnubisKid,So is this what the streams are  normally like then? XD
11-07-2019T22:29:06,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:ctwokinds-nibsdance:
11-07-2019T22:29:12,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-statuerawr:*[Someone mention ROCKS!?]

11-07-2019T22:29:22,FoxxTrotter,(Expect TGWonder isn't here. :0P)
11-07-2019T22:29:23,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock: n-no
11-07-2019T22:29:24,InTheLionsDen,:ctwokinds-nibsdance:
11-07-2019T22:29:29,FoxxTrotter,except*
11-07-2019T22:29:38,Bgrmystr2,"@Foxx he's not mad, he's fancy"
11-07-2019T22:29:46,FoxxTrotter,"Yes, I know."
11-07-2019T22:29:48,Bgrmystr2,the FANCIEST
11-07-2019T22:29:53,FoxxTrotter,A fancy DORK.
11-07-2019T22:30:09,Bgrmystr2,"perhaps, but that's not the important part."
11-07-2019T22:30:23,Mippy,Dorkus malorcus
11-07-2019T22:30:23,BadFoMo,...But I didn't mean for it to hurt her. It would be like how some people can get a string to go into their mouth and come out their nose.
11-07-2019T22:30:38,NextGenAnubisKid,"Yeeesh, I thought the 4th had passed. Someone's either shooting off fireworks or someone needs to get their engine serviced"
11-07-2019T22:30:55,IronHorseComics,don't want to waste perfectly good fireworks
11-07-2019T22:30:56,Bgrmystr2,"you'd have to go through the eardrum, Fomo"
11-07-2019T22:31:03,Bgrmystr2,which takes up the entire ear canal.
11-07-2019T22:31:07,Sclimshady,Everyday is freedom day!
11-07-2019T22:31:07,Nekonny,did someone mention TGwodner? XD
11-07-2019T22:31:10,NextGenAnubisKid,Least I hope it was fireworks
11-07-2019T22:31:24,NextGenAnubisKid,Got a notice on my apartment door today that crime was increasing in the area.
11-07-2019T22:31:38,BadFoMo,@Nekonny I've heard of them.
11-07-2019T22:31:49,FoxxTrotter,Wonder is a cool dude.
11-07-2019T22:31:56,Watsup,wonder is a dork :V
11-07-2019T22:32:03,ZRO4825,XD
11-07-2019T22:32:04,thestooge2222,*looks over at Nekonny's stream* GASP! more Paprika!?!? !!!JOY!!!
11-07-2019T22:32:07,FoxxTrotter,Yes...mentioned that. ;0P
11-07-2019T22:32:21,Sclimshady,Haven't watched many streams  but they seem cool
11-07-2019T22:32:33,SageSaga,Ron- why didnt anyone introduce me to the other people?
11-07-2019T22:32:47,Watsup,We were the other people :V
11-07-2019T22:32:53,Nekonny,HUm
11-07-2019T22:32:56,Nekonny,Um
11-07-2019T22:33:00,BadFoMo,@Bgrmystr2 I thought someone said that the Human ears and the Cat ears (on the same side could go to the same eardrum.)
11-07-2019T22:33:05,Nekonny,I'm really sorry T_T
11-07-2019T22:33:21,Nekonny,I would have don't it at the tables; but you were so far away from me
11-07-2019T22:33:28,SageSaga,people were sitting next to me at dinner and i had no idea who they were
11-07-2019T22:33:30,Watsup,Nekonny was trying to get bird advice and forgot :V
11-07-2019T22:33:32,Bgrmystr2,"it's a theory Fomo, but we don't know lol"
11-07-2019T22:33:34,Nekonny,but after the con at the zoo...
11-07-2019T22:33:41,RimaDraws,i would introduce people to you sage
11-07-2019T22:33:45,Nekonny,I'm not sure
11-07-2019T22:33:53,Nekonny,you were playing a game once
11-07-2019T22:33:57,Watsup,Was Sage at the zoo with us?
11-07-2019T22:33:58,Nekonny,and the other time
11-07-2019T22:33:58,SageSaga,there are now Katbox people who were at the con with me- and i never met them
11-07-2019T22:34:04,IronHorseComics,"oh lord, there's a scary thought, a furry con at a zoo"
11-07-2019T22:34:05,SageSaga,i was there
11-07-2019T22:34:06,Nekonny,was early on..
11-07-2019T22:34:15,Nekonny,"still though, I should have done that"
11-07-2019T22:34:18,Nekonny,I'm really sorry
11-07-2019T22:34:22,Watsup,There was a whole table of dorks Neko didn't introduce you to
11-07-2019T22:34:29,Watsup,the CT dev team and dork artists
11-07-2019T22:34:37,SageSaga,Id sat right next to me with these 3 other people and he never introduced me
11-07-2019T22:34:52,Watsup,He came to get advice on drawing proper cute bird anthros
11-07-2019T22:34:57,Nekonny,"yeah ^^"""
11-07-2019T22:35:05,Nekonny,I'm sorry sage

11-07-2019T22:36:24,Watsup,Jeso kept dropping all of his stuff while he was introducing himself and trying to shake hands
11-07-2019T22:36:26,Watsup,lol
11-07-2019T22:36:26,SageSaga,what we had was special!

11-07-2019T22:37:57,Watsup,"You'll meet more peeps next AC, I've still never said hi to Tom I don't think :V"

11-07-2019T22:45:52,Mihari,Toyoko daki would be daki inception because she would have a Shiden Daki in her daki pose.

11-07-2019T22:46:10,IronHorseComics,"oh I thought it was like the NMRA model train show, different location every year"

11-07-2019T22:59:08,Nekonny,I'm confused... Hybrid meant somethign else in brazil...
11-07-2019T22:59:12,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"we herd a BANG, and most of us were like ""What was that."" but my dad went 'HA"" and kept driving."
11-07-2019T22:59:13,SageSaga,not including the times were were all electric- its a 2012 prius
11-07-2019T22:59:20,CrRAR,lol
11-07-2019T22:59:26,Nekonny,there it was a car that could run on both gas and alcohol
11-07-2019T22:59:30,ZRO4825,"ahhh, damn, that's better MPG than I'd heard of those getting."

11-07-2019T22:59:50,Nekonny,so whats the hybrid mean in the states?
11-07-2019T22:59:55,Sclimshady,Hybrid just means two power sources Ron
11-07-2019T23:00:02,CrRAR,lol expected casualty
11-07-2019T23:00:02,Nekonny,so whats the other?
11-07-2019T23:00:04,SageSaga,Zro - taking easy roads up into the mountains and then going down hill saves a ton on Electric
11-07-2019T23:00:09,Sclimshady,Typically Gas/electric in the states
11-07-2019T23:00:22,Nekonny,so you charges your car sage?
11-07-2019T23:00:28,IronHorseComics,Hybrid: A car driven by super pretentious people who would rather save one tree than a hundred human lives
11-07-2019T23:00:37,IronHorseComics,"well, to me at least"
11-07-2019T23:00:41,Sclimshady,It charges itself Ron
11-07-2019T23:00:51,SageSaga,yeah while going down hill for long stretches we can throw it into Battery and it just charges as ya go
11-07-2019T23:01:04,CrRAR,"Yeah, not all hybrids require plugging-in"
11-07-2019T23:01:13,Nekonny,ah
11-07-2019T23:01:16,IronHorseComics,but that's just me as a guy who hates seeing its infestation into motorsports
11-07-2019T23:01:21,ZRO4825,"Yeah, I've been looking into the new Honda Insight, and it's a damned nice car. The idea of swapping to an automatic irks me though. :joy:"

11-07-2019T23:01:49,MatyMaty,I live in a country were pollution due to cars is just out of control
11-07-2019T23:02:05,MatyMaty,you don't want to have to deal with that
11-07-2019T23:02:08,ZRO4825,"I agree Sclim, except I work a delivery job and that electric motor in-town is just TOO damned nice on gas prices."
11-07-2019T23:02:09,Sclimshady,The engine will also charge it Ron
11-07-2019T23:02:11,Twokinds,I can't wait until driving is a thing of the past.

11-07-2019T23:03:08,SageSaga,Ron- thats why you use folded space
11-07-2019T23:03:12,IronHorseComics,I'd be down for teleporting
11-07-2019T23:03:16,Mihari,I'd prefer full dive and showing up to virtual stuff myself *nods*
11-07-2019T23:03:21,AshnardSQRL,Howdy
11-07-2019T23:03:22,MatyMaty,"if teleporting exist, how long would it be for RL telefragging to exist? :P"

11-07-2019T23:03:37,SageSaga,immediately Maty
11-07-2019T23:03:43,Nekonny,that teleporters are actually just fancy replicators/suicide booths
11-07-2019T23:03:45,SpazztasticKiwi,why teleport when you can be there with your imagination
11-07-2019T23:03:49,AshnardSQRL,"Oh snap, RWBY music :ptv-excited:"
11-07-2019T23:03:51,SageSaga,and im for Full Dive VR with Mihari

11-07-2019T23:04:02,ZRO4825,omg yes please to full dive VR <3
11-07-2019T23:04:03,Mihari,Tom would never leave his house again!

11-07-2019T23:04:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom doesn’t leave his house now what are you talking about
11-07-2019T23:04:16,Sclimshady,I would full dive even if I knew i would be trapped
11-07-2019T23:04:25,Mihari,"I said again, he left for the con didn't he? :P"
11-07-2019T23:04:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe who knows that may have been a clone
11-07-2019T23:04:47,Mippy,^
11-07-2019T23:04:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Or a cardboard cut out
11-07-2019T23:04:48,SageSaga,Maty- it's true though- you tear something apart and put it back together- is it really you?
11-07-2019T23:04:50,IronHorseComics,you'd just be in that movie that was super ahead of it's time starring Silvestor Stallone
11-07-2019T23:05:00,SageSaga,thats why if you wanna teleport- Fold Space
11-07-2019T23:05:00,IronHorseComics,can't remember the name of it
11-07-2019T23:05:01,AshnardSQRL,Can I have full dive VR where ai can be my son's but everything looks 2D and stylized rather than like real life
11-07-2019T23:05:13,AshnardSQRL,My sona*
11-07-2019T23:05:21,SageSaga,of course

11-07-2019T23:05:28,MatyMaty,"Well I guess that can be applied to other stuff. If you transfer all of a brain's info into computer data, it is still the same?}"
11-07-2019T23:05:32,AshnardSQRL,Autocorrect on my tablet is irritating
11-07-2019T23:05:48,SageSaga,nah we cant be sure its not missing something
11-07-2019T23:06:04,Nekonny,theres a bunch a scientists that think thats what it basicly is
11-07-2019T23:06:05,Mippy,Ah🤔 The Autocucumber
11-07-2019T23:06:07,BadFoMo,"I remember hearing about replicators/suicide booth teleportation while watching ""Oh Canada""."

11-07-2019T23:06:49,CrRAR,xD
11-07-2019T23:06:58,SageSaga,Full Dive though- i dont see why you wouldnt just have everything look however you want
11-07-2019T23:07:12,SageSaga,you can talk to people that see everyone as furries while they see anime characters
11-07-2019T23:07:20,Bgrmystr2,"Those commercials were dumb, Sclim. You're damn right we'd download a that."
11-07-2019T23:07:25,Bgrmystr2,whatever that was.
11-07-2019T23:07:49,Mippy,Replicator/suicide booth thing...yeah I know of that. It was brought up in a conversation I was having with my Dad about Star Trek
11-07-2019T23:07:55,Sclimshady,When cd movies came out
11-07-2019T23:08:21,IronHorseComics,aaaaaaaaaaaaaanyway
11-07-2019T23:08:26,ZRO4825,"That'd be hard to coordinate though, Sage. Like, how do you transfer someone's fursona intoa  proper anime character? What features transfer and what don't?"

11-07-2019T23:08:57,SageSaga,you would assign people how you want them to look
11-07-2019T23:09:05,w0lfmare,Seems like tempting fate XD
11-07-2019T23:09:11,SageSaga,so i could make everyone i didnt care about look like Ron

11-07-2019T23:17:44,Mihari,Someone gets it atleast.
11-07-2019T23:17:45,RisqueRaptor,Like miles from the shores.

11-07-2019T23:18:39,Mihari,That's cause you didn't have the forsight to know that a dock that accepts cruiseliners should extend farther out XD
11-07-2019T23:18:39,RisqueRaptor,"Basically, don't take your chances straying too far from shore unless you're an athletic swimmer."
11-07-2019T23:18:54,Sclimshady,We have a beach with a 300 ft drop with crazy currents 50 ft from shore

11-07-2019T23:21:12,SageSaga,yeah you can link a think so long as you say what it is before the link and its sfw
11-07-2019T23:21:38,MatyMaty,"well Neko, you should have made a last panel with that Steve being led in cuffs into a police car"

11-07-2019T23:23:13,Mihari,"There were other reasons that followed for me to hate them, but I don't really remember anymore, the biggun was already done and damage done, so who cares."
11-07-2019T23:23:13,MatyMaty,I have to wonder though. Why it is always male human and elf bride? why never the other way around? :P
11-07-2019T23:23:29,Mihari,Cause elf female better?
11-07-2019T23:23:29,Bgrmystr2,"I was reading the manga, sage"

11-07-2019T23:23:46,PurpleLemons,because male dominant market
11-07-2019T23:23:47,MatyMaty,male elves can be hot...
11-07-2019T23:23:56,Mihari,But not as hot as a female one can be :P
11-07-2019T23:23:57,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Like Legolas
11-07-2019T23:23:57,Nekonny,I saw LOTR
11-07-2019T23:23:59,PurpleLemons,and that way we can get more trash waifus
