26-02-2019T00:31:29,SpazztasticKiwi,I aim to try meeting this kid tomorrow at the library to see what I have to work with
26-02-2019T00:32:00,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve already got some base sources and notes because from the sound of it he needs it

26-02-2019T00:41:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I want to know what‚Äôs in Reni‚Äôs dress in the anthro sketch because we could build bridges with that kind of support

26-02-2019T00:46:44,Dadrobit,"So for shits 'n giggles, I took a tour of a local tech college with its own radio broadcasting studios. I expressed my experiences and interest in their program, and holy shit. I have never had so much smoke blown up my ass in such a short period of time!"
26-02-2019T00:47:26,Dadrobit,It was actually physically uncomfortable listening to them.

26-02-2019T01:09:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Does it seem that way
26-02-2019T01:10:09,Ordithus,Would I know

26-02-2019T01:20:39,Dadrobit,Their radio program seemed more or less on the up and up if only a little outdated. But their recording studio program looked like a joke.
26-02-2019T01:23:45,Dadrobit,It was a little concerning though when I talked with one of their second year students and they could't identify the microphone they were using in the radio booth. Firstly it is a very iconic microphone for the recording industry...
26-02-2019T01:24:12,Dadrobit,"And secondly, and secondly it has its name written right on the darn thing."

26-02-2019T17:25:19,ThingsAreMoving,I'm still not sure with Natani. Which syllable do you put the stress on?
26-02-2019T17:25:27,Bgrmystr2,silent H.. gonna call you TingsAreMoving from now on.
26-02-2019T17:25:27,ThingsAreMoving,First or second?
26-02-2019T17:25:45,ThingsAreMoving,"Plsno, bgr"
26-02-2019T17:26:08,Bgrmystr2,"you sure, Ting? I'm sure it'll be fine."
26-02-2019T17:26:21,ThingsAreMoving,Some Ting will be Wong
26-02-2019T17:26:27,Bgrmystr2,hahaha

26-02-2019T17:30:10,Dadrobit,"I believe it is officially pronounced as ""Nah-tan-ee"" as in kind of a Native American style."
26-02-2019T17:30:49,Dadrobit,"Alternatively, it is also pronounced NTNI as the A's are silent."
26-02-2019T17:31:00,Bgrmystr2,that doesn't really answer which syllable to stress
26-02-2019T17:31:06,Bgrmystr2,"and yes NTNI for real, I remember that xD"
26-02-2019T17:31:30,Dadrobit,"Only for Natani though. In Flora's case, the A is over-expressed as in FlorAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"

26-02-2019T17:32:33,ThingsAreMoving,but with Nat it's eith NAtani or naTAni
26-02-2019T17:32:45,Bgrmystr2,the latter is how I say it

26-02-2019T17:34:08,TerraTheWizard,is mayhaps an actual word or is it just a portmanteau
26-02-2019T17:34:22,Bgrmystr2,it's a portmanteau of maybe and perhaps.
26-02-2019T17:35:10,ThingsAreMoving,I see a word that I'm unfamiliar with.
26-02-2019T17:35:51,ThingsAreMoving,Well that 'portmanteau' is a useful word.
