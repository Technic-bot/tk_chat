15-02-2019T00:44:59,LannAF,And is forcing me to do training again
15-02-2019T00:45:05,LannAF,"rather, I never did the training"
15-02-2019T00:45:14,LannAF,But I've played tons of games and won tons of games

15-02-2019T00:46:42,LannAF,I accidently killed Vaelor when I started rezzing him outside the circle when it was hurting
15-02-2019T00:46:44,LannAF,woops.
15-02-2019T00:46:59,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Pro strats
15-02-2019T00:47:17,SageSaga,Lann- i need to know what kinda game you are planning for Skyrim together
15-02-2019T00:47:28,LannAF,um.
15-02-2019T00:47:29,LannAF,A fun one?
15-02-2019T00:47:38,LannAF,What do you mean?
15-02-2019T00:47:48,SageSaga,then im gonna need the Jump mod
15-02-2019T00:47:55,LannAF,jump mod for what
15-02-2019T00:48:02,Ordithus,Getting to the Cloud District
15-02-2019T00:48:04,LannAF,I usually tended to use the jump while sprinting + double jump mod.
15-02-2019T00:48:04,Ordithus,Of course
15-02-2019T00:48:05,SageSaga,increases jump height so i can be a ninja
15-02-2019T00:48:13,LannAF,if it conflicts with that I'd rather not
15-02-2019T00:48:20,LannAF,"if it's eligible, NEAT"
15-02-2019T00:48:38,SageSaga,i never found a double jump mod or jump while sprinting mod
15-02-2019T00:48:43,LannAF,It was a 2-in-1
15-02-2019T00:48:50,LannAF,very nice mod
15-02-2019T00:49:09,Ordithus,Interesting how more complicated the shading seems to be when there is less light :P
15-02-2019T00:49:14,LannAF,also I am wondering how well body change mods work
15-02-2019T00:49:20,LannAF,Because gods some of the models are atrocious
15-02-2019T00:49:23,SageSaga,i was hoping to find a mod that like added Athletics back into the game
15-02-2019T00:49:30,LannAF,Look for one
15-02-2019T00:49:34,SageSaga,we need sexy bodies
15-02-2019T00:49:37,LannAF,when we make our party we'll all discuss
15-02-2019T00:49:38,LannAF,yes I agree
15-02-2019T00:49:43,LannAF,sticky also agrees
15-02-2019T00:49:44,SageSaga,i looked for one i couldnt find it
15-02-2019T00:49:50,LannAF,then we're SOL
15-02-2019T00:50:00,SageSaga,I only found the high jump mod
15-02-2019T00:50:04,LannAF,oh
15-02-2019T00:50:08,LannAF,I'll get it for you if you want.
15-02-2019T00:50:26,LannAF,Tom are you still up for playing with us?
15-02-2019T00:50:42,LannAF,I wanna make sure we're all ok with the mods we'll try to nab.
15-02-2019T00:50:56,Twokinds,YEAHHHHH!
15-02-2019T00:51:07,LannAF,neato burrito
15-02-2019T00:51:20,LannAF,"so far we have: better jumping, and sexy bodies mods."
15-02-2019T00:51:22,SageSaga,for body mod-
15-02-2019T00:51:24,LannAF,that's it.
15-02-2019T00:51:37,SageSaga,Caliente's Beautiful Bodies is good
15-02-2019T00:51:43,LannAF,that's the usual go-to yeah.
15-02-2019T00:51:54,SageSaga,they arent like- those creepy giant boob mods
15-02-2019T00:52:05,Corinthian,I'm heading out. Night everyone!
15-02-2019T00:52:08,LannAF,cbbe does let you have huge boobs though.
15-02-2019T00:52:15,Ordithus,night Corin
15-02-2019T00:52:20,SageSaga,not default though
15-02-2019T00:52:23,LannAF,Or do you mean half the body massive
15-02-2019T00:52:40,SageSaga,i mean like these Las Lindas boobies
15-02-2019T00:52:41,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-florajiggle:
15-02-2019T00:52:53,LannAF,"yeah I go big but not...""oh gods"" big"
15-02-2019T00:53:09,LannAF,so we're in agreeance for that.
15-02-2019T00:53:51,SageSaga,need more hair colors
15-02-2019T00:54:14,SageSaga,i have apachiiskyhair but it doesnt let you use full RGB hair coloring
15-02-2019T00:54:31,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Racemenu
15-02-2019T00:54:33,SageSaga,oh- and if Alternate Start works- i love that
15-02-2019T00:54:47,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Racemenu mod has a color wheel
15-02-2019T00:55:07,MarvTheHugPharaoh,also can had different color light affect as well
15-02-2019T00:55:10,SageSaga,i have Race Menu but it didnt seem to work
15-02-2019T00:55:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,do you have XP32 skeleton?
15-02-2019T00:55:34,SageSaga,yes
15-02-2019T00:55:48,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:cinfinitedge-ThinkyAegis: Then why no work?
15-02-2019T00:55:57,SageSaga,SkyUI always gives me an error too and i dont know why
15-02-2019T00:56:10,MarvTheHugPharaoh,script conflict?
15-02-2019T00:56:15,SageSaga,nope
15-02-2019T00:56:34,LannAF,skse mods will not work with Skyrim together
15-02-2019T00:56:38,LannAF,so DO NOT get those
15-02-2019T00:56:57,MarvTheHugPharaoh,They work fine for me

15-02-2019T00:57:29,SageSaga,why would they not work with it?
15-02-2019T00:57:29,LannAF,any mods without it: probs will work
15-02-2019T00:57:33,MarvTheHugPharaoh,That might be your error sage
15-02-2019T00:57:38,LannAF,Skyrim together can't work with mods that use it
15-02-2019T00:57:42,LannAF,or rather

15-02-2019T01:15:08,Dadrobit,6 second place finishes. I now believe victory is only something of a Superstition.
15-02-2019T01:15:36,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Thats why pathfinder is best boi

15-02-2019T01:16:20,Twokinds,Usually do
15-02-2019T01:16:37,Dadrobit,Pathfinder is tied with Caustic for best dialogue though.

15-02-2019T02:07:47,SageSaga,no
15-02-2019T02:07:55,SageSaga,he was one of the randos

15-02-2019T02:08:37,Bgrmystr2,or hair
15-02-2019T02:08:45,Bgrmystr2,but I guess it's not color yet either
15-02-2019T02:09:09,SageSaga,http://sage.katbox.net/comics/ai/blood-claw-bandits-02/
15-02-2019T02:09:56,Bgrmystr2,ahh right yeah
15-02-2019T02:10:19,Bgrmystr2,"I was lookin in the backdrops for the guy and he was the only one that stood out but his hair looks slightly different, looks more like an afro"
15-02-2019T02:10:52,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: the hell was he doin climbin up all up there and stuff.
15-02-2019T02:11:03,SageSaga,they were all up there
15-02-2019T02:11:11,Bgrmystr2,I thought they were outside..?
15-02-2019T02:11:23,SageSaga,why would they be outside?
15-02-2019T02:11:53,Bgrmystr2,because the bandits are inside waiting to ambush them when they go inside..?
15-02-2019T02:12:04,Bgrmystr2,so they stay outside while kaylin and nyna kill everyone
15-02-2019T02:12:22,SageSaga,uhhh
15-02-2019T02:13:18,SageSaga,the bandits werent inside this building- Nyna scoped out the building and said it was clear- then went off to find the bandits while Kaylin and the group took up shelter in this building
15-02-2019T02:14:03,SageSaga,"thats why the bandits snuck in and stabbed the ""sleeping people"" only to find hay - while all the real people are in the attic area ready to escape out the roof if need be"
15-02-2019T02:14:24,SageSaga,if they were outside- they would have been seen by the bandits coming from- outside
15-02-2019T02:14:41,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
15-02-2019T02:14:56,Bgrmystr2,"the sleeping thing confused me greatly, so I guess that clears things up lol"
15-02-2019T02:15:07,SageSaga,how?
15-02-2019T02:16:33,Bgrmystr2,"..I just.. said though. I thought nyna and kaylin went to where the bandits were and killed them while everyone was waiting outside, which then didn't make sense since who was sleeping inside if everyone was outside.. it just didn't."
15-02-2019T02:16:53,Bgrmystr2,sense was not found.
15-02-2019T02:16:58,SageSaga,but why would you think that?
15-02-2019T02:17:24,Bgrmystr2,Because that's what I got from the page..? xD
15-02-2019T02:17:27,SageSaga,It makes no sense because Kaylin legit said she wanted Nyna to hang back- since she didnt- Kaylin had to-
15-02-2019T02:17:52,SageSaga,and the guys even said- the boss and some of his best men left before Nyna got there to go kill Nyna's group
15-02-2019T02:18:25,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, and I got that, but that doesn't really tell me whether they went inside or not. Just that they're gonna be attacked."
15-02-2019T02:18:46,Bgrmystr2,"I don't claim to know why I read things the way I do, I just do. :u"
15-02-2019T02:18:53,SageSaga,and it showed the bandits going inside a building- and attacking them?
15-02-2019T02:19:21,Bgrmystr2,Yeah I had a confuse there.
15-02-2019T02:21:43,SageSaga,i needed to press you on that because if i had left something out and didnt realize it then it means i need to go back and fix it- but all the elements are there
15-02-2019T02:24:21,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno, there was no real transition to signify that everyone actually went inside besides the bandit group going inside which came out of nowhere to me, since as far as I knew everyone was still hanging out on the porch or whatnot where Kaylin is."
15-02-2019T02:25:28,Bgrmystr2,since it doesn't feel like any time passed at all. It couldn't have taken Nyna more than 10 or 15 mins to take out everyone in that structure..
15-02-2019T02:25:54,Bgrmystr2,and it gets like super dark outside?
15-02-2019T02:26:27,SageSaga,http://sage.katbox.net/comics/ai/blood-claw-bandits-07/
15-02-2019T02:26:31,SageSaga,first bubble
15-02-2019T02:27:05,SageSaga,page after that- Shes been wandering around the town long enough for it to be sunset
15-02-2019T02:27:50,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-wondering: I figured it was just super late day into sunset.
15-02-2019T02:27:56,SageSaga,The bandits moving into the building- it's moonlit outside- this all indicates a passage of time
15-02-2019T02:30:48,Bgrmystr2,so.. it took nyna from killing the last guy when it was still sunset to when it was already moonlit nighttime to get back to the building Kaylin and company were at?
15-02-2019T02:31:22,Bgrmystr2,was it.. that far away? or was she sleeping or something?
15-02-2019T02:31:48,SageSaga,It was far away- other side of town
15-02-2019T02:31:57,SageSaga,the tavern was on the outskirts
15-02-2019T02:32:51,SageSaga,if Nyna had ran all the way she could have made it in time to see him get his hand chopped off probably
15-02-2019T02:33:14,Bgrmystr2,"I don't expect it to take her nearly as long to get back as it took her to find them though, since it's just a straight shot back to the tavern.. but had to walk around to find the bandits"
15-02-2019T02:33:34,Bgrmystr2,"but I guess if that's how big the town was, it didn't actually look more than 7 or 8 buildings"
15-02-2019T02:34:06,SageSaga,i never showed the whole town- its an old farm town that was too large to put a wall around the whole thing
15-02-2019T02:34:50,SageSaga,thus why it had to be abandoned
15-02-2019T02:34:53,Bgrmystr2,"hmm, that might be why. I was under the impression that the town was super small and was only a few buildings super close together and couldn't fathom why time would change so quickly."
15-02-2019T02:35:57,SageSaga,there's not a ton of buildings- theres a lot of farm land between em cept the city center
15-02-2019T02:36:20,Bgrmystr2,okay
15-02-2019T02:36:27,SageSaga,Nyna was on the other side of the city center- but i dont think that was needed to explain and would have been a waste of a page explaining all that-
15-02-2019T02:36:44,Bgrmystr2,well that puts in a lot of pieces I didn't have lol
15-02-2019T02:36:49,SageSaga,"because even at the end Nyna wasnt going to hurry back- she made it obvious she doesnt think the ""boss"" was any threat"
15-02-2019T02:38:04,SageSaga,like most comic creators i expect readers to not just assume I have no idea what im doing and just assume everything is wrong
15-02-2019T02:39:18,Bgrmystr2,"Well, I don't think that everything is wrong, so if that's any consolation. :ptv-wondering:"
15-02-2019T02:40:54,SageSaga,"you assumed people were outside for no reason even though outside would be the most dangerous place to be and after the fact they said ""Hey - there are bandits in this town- so better sleep inside a building"""
15-02-2019T02:42:38,SageSaga,is that incorrect?
15-02-2019T02:43:05,Bgrmystr2,"Not true, I had reason to think they were outside, and I did not believe outside would be the most dangerous place."
15-02-2019T02:43:52,Bgrmystr2,"I would say that not everything you know about your comic will be privy to the reader. I may have missed a few things, but there are lots of people much worse than I."
15-02-2019T02:44:28,SageSaga,i get some people wont get everything but im confirming that everything ive said that was relevant is in the comic
15-02-2019T02:44:52,SageSaga,its totally normal for people to miss things- to skip over a detail here or there
15-02-2019T02:45:14,Bgrmystr2,"I think you're right, though. I did miss some things, and you do have some things that are subtle at what is happening."
15-02-2019T02:45:18,Bgrmystr2,So I'll give you that.
15-02-2019T02:45:35,Bgrmystr2,"I think they're a bit too subtle, personally, but primarily because I didn't see them outright."
15-02-2019T02:45:55,Bgrmystr2,"so I don't know if that's really a fair judgement call, just how it happened for me."
15-02-2019T02:46:20,SageSaga,"im constantly concerned that if I - and pardon the term im not calling you this - if i ""dumb down"" the comic too much it will get caught up in needless commentary and exposition"
15-02-2019T02:46:29,Bgrmystr2,yeah I understand
15-02-2019T02:46:46,Bgrmystr2,too much exposition can kill a comic
15-02-2019T02:46:51,Bgrmystr2,"or change the reader base, at least"
15-02-2019T02:46:55,Bgrmystr2,so I get it
15-02-2019T02:47:01,SageSaga,Yosh is filled with Exposition
15-02-2019T02:47:31,SageSaga,i think one of my biggest mistakes with yosh was not only including a lot of exposition- but including folk tales that people will assume is fact
15-02-2019T02:48:05,SageSaga,"simply by me saying ""This is a thing some people think in the world"" its assumed that ""oh if he bothered telling us this then it must be true!"""
15-02-2019T02:48:33,SageSaga,"and im like ""no - its a hint to the truth - not an absolute- uhhggggggggg!"" XD"
15-02-2019T02:48:36,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: this is one of those moments where I could look back on my time reading Yosh and use what I read as a good example of what I feel is a good middle-point for exposition and just subtle key clues.
15-02-2019T02:48:52,Bgrmystr2,But I didn't read it and I feel bad cuz I can't give such example. :ptv-sad:
15-02-2019T02:48:58,Bgrmystr2,I have failed.
15-02-2019T02:49:09,SageSaga,i dont blame anyone for not reading Yosh
15-02-2019T02:49:22,SageSaga,even i am trying to find a way to compress that monster
15-02-2019T02:49:37,Bgrmystr2,"I know, I just blame me for not having something as a good example"
15-02-2019T02:49:46,SageSaga,I would love to redo Yosh and fit it all in like a 300 page comic
15-02-2019T02:50:41,Bgrmystr2,"but yeah I probably missed some things, I wasn't looking for subtle clues about day change or stuff like that, I'm not accustomed to that in a comic. Usually cuz the comics I read are all black and white.."
15-02-2019T02:51:07,Bgrmystr2,"and anime is stupidly obvious when it comes to time passing, so that's a thing"
15-02-2019T02:51:54,SageSaga,"I will use tags like ""Later..."" or ""meanwhile..."" but i try not to when i can because they can be cliche"
15-02-2019T02:52:04,ZRO4825,I love it as is personally :3
15-02-2019T02:52:22,Bgrmystr2,"yeah I was actually thinking the ""soon after"" could have been ""Later that day"" or something to that effect"
15-02-2019T02:52:51,Bgrmystr2,Zro you like everything as-is. :ptv-unimpressed:
15-02-2019T02:54:55,SageSaga,the whole point of the hole in the roof was a detail of using it as an escape route
15-02-2019T02:56:01,Bgrmystr2,":thinking: that's not something I thought of. From the look of that building, jumping down from the roof would be extremely painful"
15-02-2019T02:56:34,SageSaga,look again?
15-02-2019T02:56:52,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, I can't tell where the hole is on the roof"
15-02-2019T02:57:04,Bgrmystr2,it's all like super dark shades of grey or black
15-02-2019T02:57:06,SageSaga,http://sage.katbox.net/comics/ai/blood-claw-bandits-07/
15-02-2019T02:57:17,Bgrmystr2,yeah that's the page I'm lookin at
15-02-2019T02:57:23,SageSaga,there's a big hint
15-02-2019T02:58:08,ThurKann,Hola que tal?
15-02-2019T02:58:13,Bgrmystr2,"it might be the colors on my monitor, but yeah I can't see where the hole is at all lol"
15-02-2019T02:58:20,Bgrmystr2,ohdamn
15-02-2019T02:58:31,Bgrmystr2,yeah I can't see that my monitor
15-02-2019T02:58:39,Bgrmystr2,it's like stupidly dark
15-02-2019T02:58:48,Eternity1,I can see it
15-02-2019T02:58:57,Bgrmystr2,yeah I can see it in the stream
15-02-2019T02:59:08,Eternity1,oh
15-02-2019T02:59:16,Bgrmystr2,"but not on the page itself, even on the same monitor"
15-02-2019T02:59:16,SageSaga,and i show Nyna standing up there
15-02-2019T02:59:28,ThurKann,hola
15-02-2019T02:59:29,SageSaga,so theres a platform inside there
15-02-2019T02:59:54,SageSaga,yo Thur
15-02-2019T03:00:26,Bgrmystr2,Hello Thur
15-02-2019T03:00:41,ThurKann,:>
15-02-2019T03:01:45,SageSaga,this is the benifit of having everything written out in detail before working XD
15-02-2019T03:01:52,SageSaga,benefit too
15-02-2019T03:03:16,Eternity1,"getting tired, I think i'm going to head to bed"
15-02-2019T03:03:24,Eternity1,night!
15-02-2019T03:03:38,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nighty night Eternity
15-02-2019T03:03:47,SageSaga,gnight Eternity1
15-02-2019T03:07:38,sunblaze,good morning
15-02-2019T03:07:59,SageSaga,Sunblaze!
15-02-2019T03:08:11,Bgrmystr2,heya sun
15-02-2019T03:08:11,sunblaze,yes gimme a sec
15-02-2019T03:08:14,sunblaze,I have an idea :D
15-02-2019T03:08:29,SageSaga,good because theres only one stream work day left
15-02-2019T03:08:49,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Sun
15-02-2019T03:30:23,sunblaze,and payed. sweet my own elven-booty pillow :P
15-02-2019T03:35:02,SageSaga,it is kinda funny that there might be some random person out there sleeping with a Nyna daki and has no idea who she is
15-02-2019T03:35:36,sunblaze,I see pretty cat-girl on a pillow... why send it back? :D
15-02-2019T03:36:10,sunblaze,lets hope an orphanage got it and now all the children are happy
15-02-2019T03:36:13,SageSaga,probably because its illegal to open a packages not addressed to you?
15-02-2019T03:37:22,sunblaze,risk of package-sending buisiness I guess. but yeah
15-02-2019T03:44:23,SageSaga,people being so quiet tonight
15-02-2019T03:44:52,MarvTheHugPharaoh,sleepy night tonight
15-02-2019T03:44:55,ZRO4825,"Sorry, I haven't figured out how to get my text set to louder yet :("
15-02-2019T03:45:10,Dadrobit,zzzzz
15-02-2019T03:45:20,SageSaga,louder text?
15-02-2019T03:45:28,ZRO4825,You said we were being quiet!
15-02-2019T03:46:11,SageSaga,i hate you suddenly
15-02-2019T03:46:25,sunblaze,:P
15-02-2019T03:46:29,Bgrmystr2,"you seem to be under the impression that that is a new feeling, sage"
15-02-2019T03:46:29,ZRO4825,So...You're giving me the same glare Nyna has on screen atm? :P
15-02-2019T03:46:45,SageSaga,pretty much
15-02-2019T03:46:55,SageSaga,im channeling my emotion into this drawing
15-02-2019T03:47:18,ZRO4825,"Excellent, then I have actually assisted you!"
15-02-2019T03:47:44,SageSaga,im gonna stab you with my brain
15-02-2019T03:48:05,ZRO4825,Let me at least hug my Kaylin daki first. She's my support pillow. D:
15-02-2019T03:48:06,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-laugh:
15-02-2019T03:48:09,SageSaga,speakin' of stabb'n
15-02-2019T03:48:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,stabby stabby?
15-02-2019T03:48:48,SageSaga,i had a dream where i was at Anthro con and a person in a fursuit stabbed me to death and dyed his fursuit red with my blood
15-02-2019T03:49:06,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-confused: uh..
15-02-2019T03:49:09,Bgrmystr2,right then
15-02-2019T03:49:25,MarvTheHugPharaoh,sounds about right
15-02-2019T03:49:52,SageSaga,im hoping that they have metal detectors at the con now
15-02-2019T03:50:24,Bgrmystr2,something something plastic knife..
15-02-2019T03:50:35,Bgrmystr2,"or glass, even."
15-02-2019T03:50:35,SageSaga,a con that lets people go around wearing full body suits including masks? they could have all kinds of weapons in those things
15-02-2019T03:51:03,SageSaga,also theres a reason plastic and glass knives arent commonly used... they arent as effective
15-02-2019T03:51:27,SageSaga,im more likely to survive a plastic or glass knife attack than a metal one
15-02-2019T03:52:06,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, maybe, but if they stabbed you to death, would it matter what it's made of..?"
15-02-2019T03:52:08,SageSaga,not saying they cant kill me- im just slightly more likely to not die
15-02-2019T03:53:10,Bgrmystr2,"also, can't glass get as sharp as metal?"
15-02-2019T03:53:54,SageSaga,the sharper glass gets the more brittle it gets
15-02-2019T03:54:14,Bgrmystr2,"I know generic plastic can't, but I think they have some types of super strong plastics that might be an alternative.."
15-02-2019T03:54:37,Bgrmystr2,"plastic combined with something else, or some kind of plastic-like thing"
15-02-2019T03:54:41,Bgrmystr2,I can't recall what it was though
15-02-2019T03:56:31,ZRO4825,You can make a knife out of jello if you're determined enough. =D
15-02-2019T03:56:52,ZRO4825,"requires like, all sorts of reheating and freezing though, but it IS technically jello."
15-02-2019T03:57:43,SageSaga,i disagree
15-02-2019T03:58:07,SageSaga,you have changed the definition to make it such- so it ceases to be
15-02-2019T03:58:36,ZRO4825,I just know what the video was labeled! o_o
15-02-2019T03:59:32,Bgrmystr2,"I mean.. it ceases to be gelatin, but it was, originally.. jello at some point prior."
15-02-2019T03:59:59,Bgrmystr2,I saw that video xD
15-02-2019T04:00:41,RedDragonSyndicate,"Calling it a night. Thanks for the art, man"
15-02-2019T04:00:48,SageSaga,"and everything was once star dust but we dont say ""Man- im gonna eat star dust for dinner"" or ""Man i cant wait to have sex with that pile of star dust!"""
15-02-2019T04:00:50,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nighty night Red
15-02-2019T04:00:51,SageSaga,take care Red
15-02-2019T04:01:08,Bgrmystr2,"it's still, technically ""Jell-O"" since even Jell-O is powder at one point, so it's not just gelatin from the title."
15-02-2019T04:01:19,ZRO4825,I just had someone on another server link me a video telling me about these huge bonkhonakahoogs.
15-02-2019T04:01:30,MarvTheHugPharaoh,That feeling when star dust is a wrestler
15-02-2019T04:01:40,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock:
15-02-2019T04:02:03,Bgrmystr2,Massive dahoonkabankaloos.
15-02-2019T04:02:07,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-ohmy:
15-02-2019T04:07:49,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I love it when Picarto chat keeps crashing.
15-02-2019T04:08:20,Bgrmystr2,you should tell it to not do that.
15-02-2019T04:08:55,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Why do you think I was trying to speak robot earlier
15-02-2019T04:12:01,SageSaga,"but- wouldnt that be kinda like saying ""I want to learn how to talk like a black person to talk to black people""?"
15-02-2019T04:14:06,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Not really, you can't discriminate against rd-d2"
15-02-2019T04:14:10,MarvTheHugPharaoh,r2-d2
15-02-2019T04:14:48,SageSaga,im pretty sure you can- and he can cut you with an arc welder
15-02-2019T04:15:16,Bgrmystr2,xD
15-02-2019T04:15:20,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"speaking off, the entire universe of star wars was built around R2"
15-02-2019T04:16:43,SageSaga,just gonna gloss over your roboracism
15-02-2019T04:16:50,MarvTheHugPharaoh,yes
15-02-2019T04:19:18,SageSaga,smart move- i cant fault you on it if you admit it XD
15-02-2019T04:19:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:cw0lfmare-SilSly:
15-02-2019T04:20:28,Bgrmystr2,"funny enough, this might be my favorite song from the entire RWBY soundtrack."
15-02-2019T04:20:44,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Hey man, just getting ready to hate shynet when it takes over is all"
15-02-2019T04:21:00,MarvTheHugPharaoh,shynet?
15-02-2019T04:21:03,MarvTheHugPharaoh,skynet
15-02-2019T04:21:07,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Bgr type for me
15-02-2019T04:22:08,Bgrmystr2,Hi I'm marv and I'm roboracist but that's okay ignore that cuz I'm trying to become oneofthem or something definitely not to that effect because reasons yes. I like hugs.
15-02-2019T04:22:15,Bgrmystr2,That about cover it?
15-02-2019T04:22:30,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-laugh:
15-02-2019T04:22:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,You forgot the thing about dinosaurs and dog girls :cinfinitedge-DontAegis:
15-02-2019T04:23:36,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock:
15-02-2019T04:23:40,Bgrmystr2,I'm not perfect
15-02-2019T04:23:46,Bgrmystr2,Sorry Marv senpai :C
15-02-2019T04:23:49,MarvTheHugPharaoh,But you're me
15-02-2019T04:24:39,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Its about time for you to retake the me class
15-02-2019T04:24:48,Bgrmystr2,yes. I will work on it later. I've been away from the hivemind for too long.
15-02-2019T04:26:29,SageSaga,i think im done- but gonna go back to my new song to play us out-
15-02-2019T04:26:47,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Very well done
15-02-2019T04:26:57,SageSaga,i love this song now

15-02-2019T04:29:45,SageSaga,i need to put the first Bleach opening theme on my list
15-02-2019T04:29:48,SageSaga,i loved that song
15-02-2019T04:30:10,SageSaga,i wonder if it still holds up- i also loved the style they did
15-02-2019T04:32:29,SageSaga,Rap and hip hop in a language I dont know almost always sounds better to me
15-02-2019T04:33:07,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"you might like ""Home Made Kazoku - Shonen Heart"" then sage"
15-02-2019T04:33:46,SageSaga,i love shifts in tone like this
15-02-2019T04:34:40,SageSaga,it's kinda like Bohemian Rhapsody - how it sounds one way- totally switches up - goes back- changes again
15-02-2019T04:34:44,SageSaga,just not as--
15-02-2019T04:35:06,SageSaga,whats the best way to put it-
15-02-2019T04:35:16,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Not like Freddie
15-02-2019T04:35:18,SageSaga,ah- ambitious as Rhapsody
15-02-2019T04:37:51,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Nighty night Sage, thanks for the streamy"

15-02-2019T11:21:32,iliar,Today I added your paper sketches to the database. At the moment I have added 61 sketches. There are more than I thought.
15-02-2019T11:22:00,iliar,I have long wanted to ask. Why are you posting them only on Twitter?
15-02-2019T11:22:58,Twokinds,"Oh, uh, I dunno."
15-02-2019T11:23:15,Twokinds,I didn't really think about it. It seemed weird to post paper sketches to DA
15-02-2019T11:23:44,Ordithus,Tons of artists work in physical media and post on DA

15-02-2019T15:29:56,CrimsonQuill,Hi Sage

15-02-2019T15:30:10,CrimsonQuill,:ptv-greetings::ptv-greetings::ptv-greetings:
15-02-2019T15:30:16,SageSaga,has it been a long time?
15-02-2019T15:30:31,CrimsonQuill,"For me, a week without Twokinds is a long time."
15-02-2019T15:30:38,CrimsonQuill,Or rather the Twokinds chat
15-02-2019T15:30:46,CrimsonQuill,AI looks really cool btew
15-02-2019T15:31:31,CrimsonQuill,"Hey, Tom, may I ask if I'm still on cooldown?"
15-02-2019T15:31:44,Twokinds,Not as far as I know.
15-02-2019T15:31:44,CrimsonQuill,Just need to know whether I can suggest a sketch or not.
15-02-2019T15:31:50,CrimsonQuill,"Ok, thanks."
15-02-2019T15:31:57,CrimsonQuill,How's your week been guys?
15-02-2019T15:33:37,TerraTheWizard,"just suggest anyway, if you're on cooldown it just doesn't go in the polls"
15-02-2019T15:33:55,CrimsonQuill,Yeah...
15-02-2019T15:34:04,CrimsonQuill,I've been really unoriginal this week.
15-02-2019T15:34:09,SageSaga,holy crap
15-02-2019T15:34:10,CrimsonQuill,It's just a sequel to Halo Raine.
15-02-2019T15:34:25,CrimsonQuill,I couldn't think of anything else.
15-02-2019T15:34:35,CrimsonQuill,I've been watching too much Red vs Blue
15-02-2019T15:34:43,TerraTheWizard,i went with my silly keith suggestion i've had sitting around since like mid-november
15-02-2019T15:34:44,SageSaga,someone went through my entire comic and then linked every page with a character in it to prove i havent said her name in the comic yet
15-02-2019T15:34:59,CrimsonQuill,Oh. That's some dedication.
15-02-2019T15:35:06,CrimsonQuill,Quite the determination.
15-02-2019T15:35:09,TerraTheWizard,wow
15-02-2019T15:35:32,SageSaga,"""“cute little lab tech” is found in the pages: 552, 577, (1160?), 1161, 1170, 1171(where we get the title CLLT), 1174,1224, 1225, 1517, 1614, 1617, 1833, 1834, 1835, 1837, 1842, 1843, 1844, 1845, 1847, 1848, 1849, 1850, 1851, 1852, 1853, 1854, 1855, -"

15-02-2019T15:36:24,SageSaga,they then linked all of them in 3 separate giant comments
15-02-2019T15:36:32,CrimsonQuill,Holy Moly.
15-02-2019T15:36:40,CrimsonQuill,And you have how many pages in YOSH?
15-02-2019T15:36:52,CrimsonQuill,(I've never even finished it!)
15-02-2019T15:37:16,Twokinds,how do you even search yosh? I can't find the archive anymore
15-02-2019T15:37:26,Twokinds,And just inserting the number in the url doesn't work
15-02-2019T15:37:33,Mippy,"How’s it going Sage, my #2 man?"
15-02-2019T15:37:51,SageSaga,XD
15-02-2019T15:37:58,CrimsonQuill,"Well, Tom, the Archive is tough for me too."
15-02-2019T15:38:01,CrimsonQuill,Or rather was.
15-02-2019T15:38:05,SageSaga,the site is fully operational like the second death star
15-02-2019T15:38:09,CrimsonQuill,Before I gave up and started AI
15-02-2019T15:38:17,SageSaga,all the features on the other hand arent done
15-02-2019T15:38:27,CrimsonQuill,@SageSaga make sure that shield doesn't go down then.
15-02-2019T15:38:31,Rosscoe,Evenings!
15-02-2019T15:38:36,CrimsonQuill,'ullo
15-02-2019T15:39:09,SageSaga,but yeah Tom- that means this person went through it all one at a time and recorded each link
15-02-2019T15:40:14,Twokinds,Impressive. Most impressive.
15-02-2019T15:40:29,Mippy,"Oh look, Quill is back"
15-02-2019T15:40:55,CrimsonQuill,Hi Mippy
15-02-2019T15:41:17,CrimsonQuill,"Yes, I have returned from Requiem, and have been debriefed and released on Leave."
15-02-2019T15:41:39,CrimsonQuill,Just waiting for my Mjolnir armor upgrade.
15-02-2019T15:41:43,CrimsonQuill,"And my Caboose plush,"
15-02-2019T15:42:22,Mippy,"You could say I’m on leave as well....winter break at school. Time to catch up with games, books, anime. Whatever"
15-02-2019T15:42:53,CrimsonQuill,"Heh, I was joking about the leave."
15-02-2019T15:43:00,CrimsonQuill,I have to learn Calculus ASAP
15-02-2019T15:43:03,CrimsonQuill,And Matrices
15-02-2019T15:43:06,CrimsonQuill,And Resections
15-02-2019T15:43:11,CrimsonQuill,And all that malarky
15-02-2019T15:43:22,CrimsonQuill,*Siiiiiiiigh*
15-02-2019T15:43:36,CrimsonQuill,Surveying has so much difficult mathematics.
15-02-2019T15:43:53,Mippy,"Yup, my dad is a surveyor"
15-02-2019T15:44:05,CrimsonQuill,Mine was a building surveyor.
15-02-2019T15:44:14,CrimsonQuill,He gave me his old RICS card when I was 12
15-02-2019T15:44:25,Mippy,LAnd
15-02-2019T15:44:39,CrimsonQuill,I'm going for land and general too.
15-02-2019T15:44:50,CrimsonQuill,I want to eventually make my way to Marine
15-02-2019T15:44:51,Mippy,Works for the pipeline guys
15-02-2019T15:45:03,CrimsonQuill,You should see the SONAR some of the boats have.
15-02-2019T15:45:26,CrimsonQuill,A surveying boat had a visiting day-the sonar can pick up INDIVIDUAL PEBBLES on the sea floor.
15-02-2019T15:45:42,CrimsonQuill,And a lot of servers are needed to process that data
15-02-2019T15:45:54,CrimsonQuill,GIS takes serious computing power
15-02-2019T15:47:08,Mippy,I am freezing my buns off right now
15-02-2019T15:47:24,CrimsonQuill,How cold is it where you are?

15-02-2019T15:54:20,SageSaga,you mean with the visuals gone?
15-02-2019T15:54:30,SageSaga,the lacking of a theme?
15-02-2019T15:54:35,Mippy,Last time I looked it was still a bit broken
15-02-2019T15:54:42,SageSaga,its not broken

15-02-2019T16:06:06,Bgrmystr2,mornin
15-02-2019T16:06:38,CrimsonQuill,Hello Brg
15-02-2019T16:09:01,Rosscoe,"I use to build webpages from scratch, manually code it all, now you can do more the ncheat sheet it with pull and drop options from sites"
15-02-2019T16:10:08,SageSaga,i used to do my websites in txt documents too
15-02-2019T16:15:52,CrimsonQuill,I can't code.
15-02-2019T16:16:11,CrimsonQuill,That's a problem when Geographic Information Systems are part and parcel of the job.
15-02-2019T16:21:48,CatzArt,Im back and the first thing I see is GIS. No I dont want to make anything in ARCGIS again!
15-02-2019T16:21:53,Twokinds,Yeah my first website was all manual html
15-02-2019T16:22:02,Twokinds,Had to teach myself how to do it.
15-02-2019T16:22:03,CrimsonQuill,"You know the pain too, Catz."
15-02-2019T16:22:13,CrimsonQuill,That makes two of us.
15-02-2019T16:22:33,CrimsonQuill,"Then again, my failure is more in just maths."
15-02-2019T16:22:40,CatzArt,Hiya Tom! yeah thats why Im gonna do my comic on smakjeeves so i dont have to code.
15-02-2019T16:22:48,CrimsonQuill,How long did it take to teach yourself Tom?
15-02-2019T16:22:49,SageSaga,Tom- do you remember- w3schools?
15-02-2019T16:22:59,CatzArt,but yeah Quill I know your pain!
15-02-2019T16:24:11,Twokinds,Yes
15-02-2019T16:24:27,Twokinds,I still use it sometimes on the rare occassion I do have to implement something.
15-02-2019T16:24:33,SageSaga,XD
15-02-2019T16:24:35,CatzArt,whats w3schools?
15-02-2019T16:24:38,CrimsonQuill,Wowzer.
15-02-2019T16:24:39,Twokinds,Usually just to copy some example code and change it to what I need.
15-02-2019T16:24:54,SageSaga,its a place that helps you learn how to code in html and later CSS and all that jazz
15-02-2019T16:24:59,iliar,"Over the years, the HTML has changed a lot. At school, I also made a website on pure HTML. But now when he took up again to make the site, I realized that technology has changed a lot and many things have to be studied from scratch."
15-02-2019T16:25:13,CatzArt,im gonna check that out
15-02-2019T16:25:38,SageSaga,its been around since before 2000 i think
15-02-2019T16:25:47,SageSaga,ah 1999 and its still updated
15-02-2019T16:25:55,CatzArt,But I should just improve my art first
15-02-2019T16:26:32,Rosscoe,is still improving his art
15-02-2019T16:27:26,CrimsonQuill,@CatzArt I designed a new Halo armour for the next member of Raine and Kessah's fireteam
15-02-2019T16:27:44,CrimsonQuill,I actually spend a lot of Friday and Yesterday sketching it and inking it in.
15-02-2019T16:27:50,CatzArt,cool Quill. but yeah im improving but it needs work
15-02-2019T16:27:54,CrimsonQuill,I might change a few bits here and there.
15-02-2019T16:28:03,CrimsonQuill,I'm improving too...slowly.
15-02-2019T16:28:12,CrimsonQuill,"I'm calling it the ""Bastion""."
15-02-2019T16:28:48,CrimsonQuill,"The armour of Spartan-IV Thomas Bailey, one of Raine's first new friends as part of Fireteam Wolf/Luna"
15-02-2019T16:30:45,CatzArt,cool. seems like ya got it figured out. I'm drawing the Norge

15-02-2019T16:34:05,CrimsonQuill,I'm just picking up steam on mine....
15-02-2019T16:34:18,CrimsonQuill,"Draw and colour something each week, scan it, upload it...."
15-02-2019T16:34:27,CrimsonQuill,At least until the scanner broke.
15-02-2019T16:34:37,CatzArt,I wish I could go that fast.. Im slow
15-02-2019T16:34:41,CrimsonQuill,Now I have to use my camera to take photos.
15-02-2019T16:34:49,CrimsonQuill,I'm just experimenting.
15-02-2019T16:35:08,CrimsonQuill,I think I'll reach my sister's and Tom's level in 2-3 years or so.
15-02-2019T16:35:19,CrimsonQuill,If I keep practicing.
15-02-2019T16:35:21,CatzArt,Im just trying to get my footing.

15-02-2019T16:39:40,Bgrmystr2,"if you're on mobile, maybe it's buggy?"
15-02-2019T16:39:41,CatzArt,the manga artists workbook includes tracing and drawing paper
15-02-2019T16:39:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Mobile nothing

15-02-2019T16:42:48,CatzArt,but yeah I need to finish that book i never finished using it
15-02-2019T16:43:02,CrimsonQuill,I haven't even started
15-02-2019T16:43:14,CrimsonQuill,I use drawing books as guidlines.
15-02-2019T16:43:22,CrimsonQuill,I'm trying to develop a few styles.
15-02-2019T16:43:37,CrimsonQuill,I want to do some Discworld caricatures at some point.
15-02-2019T16:46:50,CatzArt,I dont really now what im doing anymore. Just trying to draw. I have a few artists that im taking inspiration from
15-02-2019T16:47:39,CrimsonQuill,I think that I need to give my subjects proper personalities.
15-02-2019T16:47:45,CrimsonQuill,Make them come to life...
15-02-2019T16:47:53,CrimsonQuill,I assume you saw Julia Custodes?
15-02-2019T16:47:56,CatzArt,What do you mean?
15-02-2019T16:48:05,CatzArt,bring them to life?
15-02-2019T16:48:15,CrimsonQuill,Just let them draw themselves with my hand.
15-02-2019T16:48:51,CrimsonQuill,Bill Watterson said that while writing Calvin and Hobbes he was often as surprised at some of the things the characters did as he was.
15-02-2019T16:48:55,CrimsonQuill,That's what I aim for.
15-02-2019T16:49:03,CrimsonQuill,I want my characters to surprise ME.
15-02-2019T16:49:08,CatzArt,heh interesting. I just treat it like putting a puzzle together. I have an image in my head i just got to use my skils to put it on the page
15-02-2019T16:49:27,CrimsonQuill,"So, Whad'ya think of my stuff so far?"
15-02-2019T16:49:42,CatzArt,let me go give the gallery a look Brb
15-02-2019T16:49:48,CrimsonQuill,Ok
15-02-2019T16:51:10,CatzArt,ah yes I remember the hunter of salamandstra picture
15-02-2019T16:51:32,CrimsonQuill,"Ah, that's what started my once a week thing in the first place."
15-02-2019T16:51:51,CrimsonQuill,It was that picture that made me realise that I COULD make a good picture.
15-02-2019T16:51:57,CrimsonQuill,And it almost drew itself.
15-02-2019T16:52:02,CrimsonQuill,I just kept adding bits on...
15-02-2019T16:52:20,CrimsonQuill,John Joesco hasn't sent me a reply on the email I sent him though...
15-02-2019T16:52:27,SageSaga,brb

15-02-2019T16:54:09,CatzArt,yeah keep up the good work Quill
15-02-2019T16:54:54,CrimsonQuill,Oh thanks
15-02-2019T16:55:23,CrimsonQuill,That Halo Kessah one made me decide to come up with the rest of Raine's Fireteam.
15-02-2019T16:55:42,CrimsonQuill,Kessah in the Haloverse is an ex-Marine from Meridian.
15-02-2019T16:55:57,CrimsonQuill,Where that Guardian was
15-02-2019T16:56:00,CrimsonQuill,in 5
15-02-2019T16:56:15,CrimsonQuill,Do you have any Halo OCs
15-02-2019T16:57:40,CatzArt,No. I did create a halo game concept following Johnson
15-02-2019T16:57:59,CatzArt,thats about it other than a few scrapped ship designs
15-02-2019T16:58:24,CrimsonQuill,"The background for my Spartan Bailey is that ONI tried to arrest him for ""tampering with the Mjolnir Gen 2 Platform""...."
15-02-2019T16:58:41,CrimsonQuill,Which just so happens to be the Bastion Armour that he has designed
15-02-2019T16:59:05,CrimsonQuill,Plus his sister is a high ranker who pulled some strings to ruin their sadistic fun
15-02-2019T16:59:12,CrimsonQuill,I really hate ONI
15-02-2019T16:59:26,CatzArt,cool. anywho I got to bounce and get some school work done. brb

15-02-2019T17:17:11,Bgrmystr2,I mean.. I don't know what happened yet
15-02-2019T17:17:12,sunblaze,she was hoping for a fight but al she got was the riff-raff bandits
15-02-2019T17:17:19,Bgrmystr2,"so as it stands, now, technically yes"
15-02-2019T17:17:33,Bgrmystr2,"but by the time the comic goes up, then probably not."
15-02-2019T17:18:43,sunblaze,so over time your perception changes from partly at fault to innocent kitten?
15-02-2019T17:18:56,sunblaze,would do the same
15-02-2019T17:19:15,Bgrmystr2,I mean
15-02-2019T17:19:21,Bgrmystr2,I don't know who did what
15-02-2019T17:19:31,Bgrmystr2,Everyone is equally at fault.
15-02-2019T17:19:35,Bgrmystr2,till I know what happened.
15-02-2019T17:20:29,Bgrmystr2,I really just see it as the same as noone being at fault.
15-02-2019T17:29:46,SageSaga,"this panel - ""We young folk gotta stick together"" ""I'm 360 years old"" ""Wow, and you look great!"" ""*Sigh*"""

15-02-2019T20:21:22,Mippy,I have a milkshake :ctwokinds-rainehappy:
15-02-2019T20:26:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Don’t say that
15-02-2019T20:26:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I might get one after work
15-02-2019T20:26:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"On another note, you see that Ethan got his wisdom teeth out?"
15-02-2019T20:28:39,Mippy,"Yup, haven’t seen the cheeks gameplays video yet though."
15-02-2019T20:29:59,SpazztasticKiwi,I watched the day of video. He was so loopy
15-02-2019T20:30:10,SpazztasticKiwi,So confused
15-02-2019T20:30:46,Mippy,I love videos of people still high on the funny gas.
15-02-2019T20:31:20,SpazztasticKiwi,I remember being pretty fine but apparently the common reaction is spicy af
15-02-2019T20:31:24,SpazztasticKiwi,spacy
15-02-2019T20:31:27,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ll be back in a bit
15-02-2019T20:31:45,Mippy,I haven’t had mine pulled so I would not know
15-02-2019T20:34:51,Mippy,Ok...gotta go back to work now that I have solved my hangy
15-02-2019T20:34:59,Mippy,Bye bye
15-02-2019T21:27:32,SpazztasticKiwi,So I just got in my car cranked it up then went into my purse looking for my keys
15-02-2019T21:27:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Anyone else see the problem with that sentence
15-02-2019T21:32:33,Bgrmystr2,"well first off, if you have a car that you crank up, it's not going to have a key"
15-02-2019T21:33:08,Bgrmystr2,"secondly, if they used the term incorrectly and just started their car, then obviously they would not be looking for their key since it's in the fucking ignition."
15-02-2019T21:34:34,Bgrmystr2,"and if you're just starting your vehicle, irrelevant of how, you wouldn't be looking for a key immediately as you have not left to go to your destination, which is where you could expect someone to turn OFF their car and look for, say, a house key."
15-02-2019T21:34:52,Bgrmystr2,which would not be attached to the same keyring as the car key..? for... reasons.
15-02-2019T21:35:02,Bgrmystr2,"there's a lot wrong, kiwi."
15-02-2019T21:35:15,Bgrmystr2,It hurts.
15-02-2019T21:54:22,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t have house keys
15-02-2019T21:54:32,SpazztasticKiwi,No need when I’m the only one out of the house
15-02-2019T21:55:26,SpazztasticKiwi,And my car keys are either on me or in my purse. Purse while at home and on me when I’m not with my phone and wallet to keep from locking them in again
15-02-2019T21:56:41,SpazztasticKiwi,"The idea is despite the car being on, and the fact I usually close the door before starting the car, I was looking for my keys even after I’d started it"
15-02-2019T21:57:00,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve also worked for the past three days straight so that has a hand in it too
15-02-2019T22:05:58,Bgrmystr2,Your brain needs a restart.
15-02-2019T22:13:47,Dadrobit,"Ah, I thought you meant that you were able to turn over the ignition without a key inserted."
15-02-2019T22:22:03,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s just hotwiring
15-02-2019T22:22:14,Ordithus,Have you ever been to a car race?  Most race cars don't have keys.  Just some switches and a button.
15-02-2019T22:22:51,SpazztasticKiwi,👴 kids these days and their fancy button cars
15-02-2019T22:22:58,Bgrmystr2,wtf do you need to look for your keys for if your car starts with a button? xD
15-02-2019T22:23:33,Ordithus,"Fancy new cars with pushbutton start still need a ""key"" in your pocket or something.  Racecar, nope."
15-02-2019T22:23:44,Ordithus,Racecars are just tempermental beasts.
15-02-2019T22:23:47,Bgrmystr2,but that's not what I asked though
15-02-2019T22:23:59,Ordithus,"Also, you'd get in trouble if it wasn't your racecar."
15-02-2019T22:24:02,Bgrmystr2,"if you already started your car with the button, then what do you need the key for? xD"
15-02-2019T22:24:11,Bgrmystr2,it can stay in your pocket
15-02-2019T22:24:14,Bgrmystr2,why search for it
15-02-2019T22:24:26,Bgrmystr2,or whereever it happens to be
15-02-2019T22:24:38,Ordithus,I got here halfway and am just being stupid
15-02-2019T22:24:42,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-reniderp:
15-02-2019T22:24:54,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-wondering:
15-02-2019T22:25:41,Ordithus,"Bgr, not even I know."
15-02-2019T22:26:10,Bgrmystr2,welp okay
15-02-2019T22:29:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t get the cars that start if the keys in the car but don’t have to be in the ignition either
15-02-2019T22:29:39,SpazztasticKiwi,But let me run a question by you guys that was run by me today by a customer
15-02-2019T22:29:56,SpazztasticKiwi,“What kind of chicken is in the chicken sandwich?”
15-02-2019T22:30:11,Ordithus,A dead one.
15-02-2019T22:33:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I hope so
15-02-2019T22:34:09,SpazztasticKiwi,I ran the question by my manager just to make sure it wasn’t just me and she was confused too
15-02-2019T22:34:41,Ordithus,"Though that could be a very open question.  White meat, dark meat?  Cage free, organic, vegeterian diet?  What breed?  Did the chicken have a name?"
15-02-2019T22:38:54,Bgrmystr2,how the fuck do you vegeterian chicken?
15-02-2019T22:39:01,Bgrmystr2,that's an oxymoron.
15-02-2019T22:39:06,Bgrmystr2,xD
15-02-2019T22:41:21,Ordithus,"Haha.  Its diet, not yours.  But yeah, I don't get that either."
15-02-2019T22:43:13,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, chicken for like.. low fat or low X or low Y I can understand moreso. You can't just.. make chicken into a plant."
15-02-2019T23:03:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Retail is arguing with miss “I only eat grass fed chickens” that chickens don’t eat grass
15-02-2019T23:03:36,SpazztasticKiwi,That was one of those instances. She seemed happy with the “it’s probably white meat” answer
15-02-2019T23:04:00,Mippy,Starting to think milkshake was not a good idea. Hello lactose
15-02-2019T23:04:11,Ordithus,Oh no Mippy
15-02-2019T23:05:48,SpazztasticKiwi,I just had one
15-02-2019T23:06:08,SpazztasticKiwi,With apple pie
15-02-2019T23:07:02,Mippy,:ctwokinds-karenOOO: was the pie warm?
15-02-2019T23:07:19,SpazztasticKiwi,No. I got it home later
15-02-2019T23:07:34,Ordithus,That is what microwaves are for
15-02-2019T23:07:46,Mippy,Too bad...still good though
15-02-2019T23:08:28,SpazztasticKiwi,And on our wisdom teeth removal thing earlier I once saw a guy who got his removed and was so out of it he asked his wife to marry him
15-02-2019T23:08:53,Ordithus,How'd that turn out?
15-02-2019T23:09:09,SpazztasticKiwi,“We’re already married dear”
15-02-2019T23:09:15,SpazztasticKiwi,“We are?!?”
15-02-2019T23:09:21,SpazztasticKiwi,“Yes”
15-02-2019T23:09:33,SpazztasticKiwi,“How late by have we been married?”
15-02-2019T23:09:39,SpazztasticKiwi,“Five years now”
15-02-2019T23:10:12,Mippy,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
15-02-2019T23:10:19,SpazztasticKiwi,"“Holy cow.” Looks at doctor/nurse in room “hey, I’m married to her - can you believe it?”"
15-02-2019T23:10:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Somebody needed a nap
15-02-2019T23:10:48,Mippy,Holy crap
15-02-2019T23:11:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Spaced. Out.
15-02-2019T23:11:03,Mippy,Funniest thing I’ve read all day
15-02-2019T23:11:12,Ordithus,"Drugs, man."
15-02-2019T23:11:31,Mippy,He got some of the good stuff
15-02-2019T23:12:51,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s all parapd of course. I might find the actual video
15-02-2019T23:12:59,SpazztasticKiwi,paraphrased
15-02-2019T23:13:34,Mippy,Oh...a guy got stabbed on my side of the city
15-02-2019T23:14:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Well there’s a turn of events
15-02-2019T23:16:04,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s a shocking number of guys hitting on their wives after surgery not realizing they’re their wives
15-02-2019T23:16:32,Ordithus,"I guess they made a good choice.  Good on earlier, non-drugged them."
15-02-2019T23:18:11,SpazztasticKiwi,How to tell if he really like you; wait for him to have a surgery and see if he drug-flirts. Got it
15-02-2019T23:18:34,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-natkeith:
15-02-2019T23:19:41,Mippy,:ctwokinds-keith8D::knife:

15-02-2019T23:21:00,SpazztasticKiwi,I know Ethan called his girlfriend pretty in his after removal video
15-02-2019T23:21:29,Bgrmystr2,"hey, that dude got to feel like the luckiest man in the world for like 2 mins"
15-02-2019T23:21:34,Bgrmystr2,let him have it.
15-02-2019T23:22:58,Mippy,The police stick got the place blocked off
