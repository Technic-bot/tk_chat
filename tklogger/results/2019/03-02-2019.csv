03-02-2019T00:02:12,Twokinds,"And, uh... I don't think I have dice."
03-02-2019T00:02:22,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-nataniAAAAshake:
03-02-2019T00:02:29,unsteddyphoenix,Shame. Its a lot more fun than an online dice roller
03-02-2019T00:02:32,RimaDraws,i bought me a set on amazon
03-02-2019T00:02:36,RimaDraws,i love my polyhedral dice
03-02-2019T00:03:09,Ordithus,They're fun to stack if you get bored waiting for your turn :ptv-uneasy:
03-02-2019T00:03:20,unsteddyphoenix,Thats...very relatable yeah lol
03-02-2019T00:03:41,Twokinds,We had a really cool fight last session

03-02-2019T00:03:59,Ordithus,Nice
03-02-2019T00:04:06,Ordithus,Sage seemed pretty excited for it Friday
03-02-2019T00:04:32,unsteddyphoenix,oooh~
03-02-2019T00:04:42,Twokinds,It was basically our part of four v another party of adventurers. All very high level
03-02-2019T00:05:01,Ordithus,Oh that is nuts
03-02-2019T00:05:13,unsteddyphoenix,Thats actually dangerous
03-02-2019T00:05:20,unsteddyphoenix,"Did Sage go easy, you think?"
03-02-2019T00:05:30,Twokinds,I'm not sure
03-02-2019T00:05:32,Twokinds,Maybe
03-02-2019T00:05:44,Twokinds,It took a lot out of us though.
03-02-2019T00:05:51,RimaDraws,how do you play DnD?
03-02-2019T00:05:52,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah I bet
03-02-2019T00:05:53,Twokinds,They were pulling out stuff like time stop
03-02-2019T00:05:56,w0lfmare,Perfect balance then
03-02-2019T00:05:59,RimaDraws,do you do a digital version?
03-02-2019T00:06:03,w0lfmare,Sage must be a good DM
03-02-2019T00:06:10,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
03-02-2019T00:06:10,Twokinds,Right off the bat their mage got five turns in one round
03-02-2019T00:06:18,Ordithus,Some say Sage was born with a d20 in his hand
03-02-2019T00:06:21,unsteddyphoenix,The mage hasted itself?
03-02-2019T00:06:24,unsteddyphoenix,Extremely selfish
03-02-2019T00:06:38,Twokinds,"No, Time Stop"
03-02-2019T00:06:58,unsteddyphoenix,Is that...thats not 5e is it?
03-02-2019T00:07:10,RimaDraws,5e?
03-02-2019T00:07:19,Dadrobit,5th edition
03-02-2019T00:07:21,Twokinds,yeah we're playing 5e

03-02-2019T00:07:38,RimaDraws,i need to post somewhere to get a group going and have some fun with it.
03-02-2019T00:07:42,unsteddyphoenix,Wth is time stop...is that a spell I havent heard of?
03-02-2019T00:07:55,Twokinds,Time Stop is a 9th lvl spell that lets you take 1d4+1 turns in a row
03-02-2019T00:07:59,unsteddyphoenix,You should Rima!
03-02-2019T00:08:08,unsteddyphoenix,Oh wow yeah here it is
03-02-2019T00:08:17,unsteddyphoenix,"9th level goddamn, what level are you guys?"
03-02-2019T00:08:24,Ordithus,And Sage rolled max... nice
03-02-2019T00:08:25,Twokinds,21
03-02-2019T00:08:26,RimaDraws,my friend plays but she lives so far away
03-02-2019T00:08:38,Ordithus,Blackjack!
03-02-2019T00:09:02,unsteddyphoenix,Past level 20? Are you gods at this point?
03-02-2019T00:09:02,Dadrobit,That's a Gingo!
03-02-2019T00:09:06,Dadrobit,Bingo!
03-02-2019T00:09:10,Twokinds,We're doing epic levels
03-02-2019T00:09:12,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Flora and flora is up :cinfinitedge-ThinkyOwOAegis:
03-02-2019T00:09:25,unsteddyphoenix,Sounds very epic indeed
03-02-2019T00:09:26,Twokinds,"And yeah, it's pretty darn fun being so powerful. It's the first epic level game I've played."
03-02-2019T00:09:45,unsteddyphoenix,"Ive never played any near that level tbh, sounds amazing"
03-02-2019T00:09:53,unsteddyphoenix,hopefully i'll get there~
03-02-2019T00:09:57,Ordithus,The campaing I'm in we're at 12
03-02-2019T00:10:00,Ordithus,It's fun
03-02-2019T00:10:12,Twokinds,My monk once hitting 21 got an ability that causes her to glow and fly and deal radiant damage on every hit. She basically goes super sayan.
03-02-2019T00:10:22,Ordithus,<3:ctwokinds-floraquestion::ctwokinds-floAAA:<3
03-02-2019T00:10:24,qwe304,only dnd game I ever played had a bad dm
03-02-2019T00:10:31,unsteddyphoenix,Did you pick the super saiyan subclass?
03-02-2019T00:10:36,unsteddyphoenix,The...soul one whatever it was?
03-02-2019T00:10:47,unsteddyphoenix,The one that lets you shoot light blasts?
03-02-2019T00:11:05,Twokinds,That's going to be my next one XD The one that lets me punch people at range
03-02-2019T00:11:08,Twokinds,With ki
03-02-2019T00:11:18,unsteddyphoenix,Niiiice~
03-02-2019T00:11:26,Bgrmystr2,literal super saiyan
03-02-2019T00:11:30,Bgrmystr2,god damn
03-02-2019T00:11:43,Twokinds,Her speed is ridiculous now
03-02-2019T00:12:05,unsteddyphoenix,She flies so...60feet?
03-02-2019T00:12:10,BluePhantom90,lol Dnd huh. I have a character worked up as a NPC and hes like the new Adult swim show Tigtone.
03-02-2019T00:12:15,Twokinds,Her base speed is 70
03-02-2019T00:12:23,unsteddyphoenix,holy
03-02-2019T00:12:25,Ordithus,zoom
03-02-2019T00:12:31,unsteddyphoenix,dejavu~
03-02-2019T00:12:31,Twokinds,We have a bard that does haste buffs and an alchemist that makes potions of speed.
03-02-2019T00:12:41,Twokinds,"And she's a monk, so she can use ki to double that speed."
03-02-2019T00:12:54,unsteddyphoenix,stepping the wind
03-02-2019T00:13:16,Bgrmystr2,so.. is there a MPH scouter reading equivilant for those of us who don't play?
03-02-2019T00:13:30,Ordithus,What's the fastest she can go?
03-02-2019T00:13:31,unsteddyphoenix,The average humans run speed is 30feet
03-02-2019T00:13:39,unsteddyphoenix,in dnd
03-02-2019T00:13:50,Ordithus,"Per round, which is about 6 seconds"
03-02-2019T00:13:56,qwe304,"well a turn is 6 seconds iirc, so shes going fast"
03-02-2019T00:13:57,Ordithus,You can generally double move
03-02-2019T00:14:02,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah
03-02-2019T00:14:14,unsteddyphoenix,So she can go...210 feet in 6 seconds just by herself
03-02-2019T00:14:34,Bgrmystr2,daaamn
03-02-2019T00:14:35,Ordithus,"At that rate, world class sprinter"
03-02-2019T00:14:46,Ordithus,"Faster, even"
03-02-2019T00:14:48,Bgrmystr2,speeeeeeeeeed
03-02-2019T00:14:56,Ordithus,Isn't she a hobbit?
03-02-2019T00:15:09,unsteddyphoenix,"Well apparently she's flying now, so"
03-02-2019T00:15:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Usain Bolt
03-02-2019T00:15:14,Twokinds,halfling
03-02-2019T00:15:21,Ordithus,That's amazing
03-02-2019T00:15:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Didn’t know he was a DnD character
03-02-2019T00:15:28,CrRAR,*fwissh fwissh*
03-02-2019T00:15:38,unsteddyphoenix,"Calling halflishs 'hobbits"" is racist"
03-02-2019T00:15:55,qwe304,what do the speen potions do?
03-02-2019T00:15:58,Ordithus,"I suppose you'd know this, living in the shire"
03-02-2019T00:16:03,Bgrmystr2,Hobbit isn't here for us to ask him if it's racist.
03-02-2019T00:16:05,Bgrmystr2,Damnit.
03-02-2019T00:16:10,qwe304,im tring to calculate her maximum speed
03-02-2019T00:16:30,Bgrmystr2,Probably around 6 or 7 speeds.
03-02-2019T00:16:39,CrRAR,"oh, EASY"
03-02-2019T00:16:43,Bgrmystr2,"Maybe 8, she seems pretty damn fast."
03-02-2019T00:17:00,Ordithus,So how did that fight go?
03-02-2019T00:17:04,Ordithus,Did you all live?
03-02-2019T00:17:05,qwe304,is 1 dnd unit 1 foot or 1 meter?
03-02-2019T00:17:28,Ordithus,foot
03-02-2019T00:17:37,unsteddyphoenix,yeah foot
03-02-2019T00:17:40,unsteddyphoenix,Annoyingly
03-02-2019T00:17:53,Twokinds,no it's 5 ft
03-02-2019T00:18:01,Twokinds,Oh
03-02-2019T00:18:08,Twokinds,Each square is 5 ft sorry
03-02-2019T00:18:13,Twokinds,yeah the speed units are ft
03-02-2019T00:18:44,unsteddyphoenix,With such a high level party I imagine you had to revivify some people?
03-02-2019T00:18:52,qwe304,"so, if all the efects described can stack multiplicativly,  they can run 80 feet per second, or 54 mph"
03-02-2019T00:19:02,unsteddyphoenix,A mage with 5 turns can absolutely kill someone
03-02-2019T00:19:08,Bgrmystr2,goddaaamn
03-02-2019T00:19:17,Bgrmystr2,that's highway speeds
03-02-2019T00:19:28,Ordithus,"Teddy, those actions can't directly affect someone else or the spell ends"
03-02-2019T00:19:36,Bgrmystr2,you could literally run into someone at that speed and kill them from the impact.
03-02-2019T00:19:40,unsteddyphoenix,"Oh, is that true?"
03-02-2019T00:19:44,unsteddyphoenix,That makes sense
03-02-2019T00:20:01,Twokinds,"Base speed 70 +70 haste, +40 potion, +180 dash, +180 step of the wind."
03-02-2019T00:20:15,Bgrmystr2,what the fuck xD
03-02-2019T00:20:17,qwe304,monk: *teleports behind you* nothing personal kid
03-02-2019T00:20:22,Ordithus,"""The spell ends if one of the actions you use during this period, or any effects that you create during this period, affects a creature other than you"""
03-02-2019T00:20:25,Bgrmystr2,hahaha no kidding qwe
03-02-2019T00:20:39,Ordithus,That is some serious movement
03-02-2019T00:21:14,Bgrmystr2,"what the literal fuck tom, your character is like.. superman speed"
03-02-2019T00:21:17,Ordithus,61 mph?
03-02-2019T00:21:22,qwe304,61.3
03-02-2019T00:21:27,unsteddyphoenix,His character IS a literal superhuman
03-02-2019T00:21:41,unsteddyphoenix,He can punch ghosts!
03-02-2019T00:21:42,Twokinds,So 90 ft / sec or about 30 m / s
03-02-2019T00:21:49,qwe304,i mean he can stop time but we think the sonic monk is weird?
03-02-2019T00:22:12,unsteddyphoenix,Wizards doin' wild stuff is a foregone conclusion
03-02-2019T00:22:18,Twokinds,lol
03-02-2019T00:22:27,unsteddyphoenix,Noone expects the monk to stun and then punch a ghost to death
03-02-2019T00:22:32,Twokinds,Their wizard also has other tricks
03-02-2019T00:22:34,Ordithus,A halfling running faster than a cheetah is a bit less expected
03-02-2019T00:22:41,Twokinds,He was using a duplicit
03-02-2019T00:22:58,unsteddyphoenix,"""What do you mean you resist everything now! I thought you were just a punch guy!"""
03-02-2019T00:23:04,unsteddyphoenix,Oh shit that OP spell
03-02-2019T00:23:23,qwe304,what type of things are you fighting?
03-02-2019T00:23:25,unsteddyphoenix,Did the dupicate then make another duplicate?
03-02-2019T00:23:28,SpazztasticKiwi,I got a tiny pie 🥧
03-02-2019T00:23:42,Twokinds,"And the real one was protected by an Invulnerability spell, which made him immune to all damage until it ended."
03-02-2019T00:24:04,unsteddyphoenix,So he buffed himself to hell when time stopped?
03-02-2019T00:24:10,Ordithus,"Share, Kiwi? :ctwokinds-maevecute:"
03-02-2019T00:24:22,Twokinds,Yeah buffed and layed out delayed fireball mines
03-02-2019T00:24:29,Ordithus,How nice
03-02-2019T00:24:35,unsteddyphoenix,Ah those things
03-02-2019T00:24:55,Twokinds,It was a great fight
03-02-2019T00:24:57,unsteddyphoenix,Now I see the point of them
03-02-2019T00:25:00,SpazztasticKiwi,🥧...maybe
03-02-2019T00:25:06,unsteddyphoenix,Sounds extremely dramatic!
03-02-2019T00:25:07,Twokinds,I ended up killing the real wizard in one punch ^^
03-02-2019T00:25:14,unsteddyphoenix,YESSS
03-02-2019T00:25:16,qwe304,"I remember a video about a guy whose dnd hated him, so he used like 3 time stop scrolls and solo'd the final boss"
03-02-2019T00:25:18,unsteddyphoenix,MONK THIS MAN
03-02-2019T00:25:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m about to go to bed anyway
03-02-2019T00:25:34,Twokinds,And I punched him through his invunerability spell
03-02-2019T00:25:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Shouldn’t be having sugar
03-02-2019T00:25:47,unsteddyphoenix,M a g i c f i s t s
03-02-2019T00:25:59,unsteddyphoenix,Are yall nearly done with that campaign?
03-02-2019T00:26:02,Ordithus,One punch!
03-02-2019T00:26:14,Twokinds,I couldn't damage him at all
03-02-2019T00:26:18,Twokinds,While he was invunerable
03-02-2019T00:26:21,Twokinds,But I didn't need to
03-02-2019T00:26:31,Twokinds,I used Quivering Palm
03-02-2019T00:27:02,Bgrmystr2,One Pawwwwwwwwnch
03-02-2019T00:27:06,unsteddyphoenix,Haha nice
03-02-2019T00:27:15,unsteddyphoenix,Wizards: known for their amazing constution
03-02-2019T00:27:20,unsteddyphoenix,./s
03-02-2019T00:27:32,Twokinds,"The moment the shield was dispelled, snapped my finger and bam, he failed the roll and HP went immediately to 0."
03-02-2019T00:27:50,unsteddyphoenix,"That move is literally ""youre already dead"" move"
03-02-2019T00:27:55,Ordithus,Shouldn't have dumped con
03-02-2019T00:27:56,Twokinds,It totally is!
03-02-2019T00:28:05,unsteddyphoenix,Never dump con
03-02-2019T00:28:12,Twokinds,I mean he was a spellcaster
03-02-2019T00:28:15,SpazztasticKiwi,So...you Thanosed him?
03-02-2019T00:28:22,Twokinds,Pretty much
03-02-2019T00:28:32,Twokinds,"Well, I gave him a heart attack, not turned him to dust."
03-02-2019T00:28:34,unsteddyphoenix,Con is still good for wizards not to break their concentration
03-02-2019T00:28:47,qwe304,nani?
03-02-2019T00:28:51,Ordithus,"Or just to, you know, survive"
03-02-2019T00:28:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Close enough
03-02-2019T00:28:55,unsteddyphoenix,Thats what HE said
03-02-2019T00:29:17,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-zenshocked:*[Nani?] *ded*
03-02-2019T00:29:33,Twokinds,"Anyway, it was a blast. Their cleric was summoning high level angels after us. They were a problem."
03-02-2019T00:29:57,unsteddyphoenix,Did you have a warlock summoning demons to counter?
03-02-2019T00:30:05,Twokinds,lol no
03-02-2019T00:30:09,unsteddyphoenix,Damn
03-02-2019T00:30:11,Twokinds,UNFORTUNATELY
03-02-2019T00:30:12,unsteddyphoenix,Dissapointing
03-02-2019T00:30:18,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah unlucky
03-02-2019T00:30:23,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m only half following
03-02-2019T00:30:23,RimaDraws,o.o
03-02-2019T00:30:25,Twokinds,Our big spellcaster was blinded right at the very beginning of the fight
03-02-2019T00:30:28,RimaDraws,same
03-02-2019T00:30:40,unsteddyphoenix,"Its fun, we promise"
03-02-2019T00:30:42,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m also very tired
03-02-2019T00:30:47,Twokinds,"Then blindly tried to take a potion to cure it, turned out to be the wrong potion, ended up in the astral plane instead"
03-02-2019T00:30:50,Ordithus,"I, too, am tired"
03-02-2019T00:30:51,Twokinds,Completely missed the entire fight
03-02-2019T00:30:53,unsteddyphoenix,Who needs sight when you have AOEs
03-02-2019T00:30:54,Ordithus,Woops
03-02-2019T00:30:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Sounds like a bucket of rules to me
03-02-2019T00:30:58,unsteddyphoenix,"Wait, lamo"
03-02-2019T00:31:05,unsteddyphoenix,That is the opposite of a calculated risk
03-02-2019T00:31:06,Ordithus,Who did that
03-02-2019T00:31:11,unsteddyphoenix,Expose them
03-02-2019T00:31:38,unsteddyphoenix,"It is a bucket of rules too, but its fun"
03-02-2019T00:31:38,Twokinds,"It's okay. That was our missing player of the week, Fluff. He was at a wedding, so he was being piloted by Sage."
03-02-2019T00:31:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Honestly that’d be me in a magic fight
03-02-2019T00:31:45,unsteddyphoenix,Ahhh.
03-02-2019T00:31:53,Ordithus,At least Sage kept his character nice and safe
03-02-2019T00:31:55,Ordithus,lol
03-02-2019T00:32:09,Twokinds,lol yeah scrambling blindly in the wrong dimension.
03-02-2019T00:32:12,Ordithus,Rather than murdering the no-show
03-02-2019T00:32:24,Twokinds,He didn't even know what was happening.
03-02-2019T00:32:38,SpazztasticKiwi,“I’ve been falling...for thirty minutes!”
03-02-2019T00:32:39,unsteddyphoenix,Thats...kinda terrifying tbh lol
03-02-2019T00:32:41,Ordithus,"""Guys, guys?  Where'd you go, this isn't funny"""
03-02-2019T00:32:52,unsteddyphoenix,"""Why did I even have this potion"""
03-02-2019T00:33:39,Twokinds,He just KEPT FAILING his roll to save v blind
03-02-2019T00:33:44,Dadrobit,"""Wait til the guys hear about THIS dimension!"""
03-02-2019T00:33:47,Twokinds,The entire fight
03-02-2019T00:33:55,SpazztasticKiwi,The dnd version of “wrong lever”
03-02-2019T00:34:02,unsteddyphoenix,"Thats also a con roll, isnt it"
03-02-2019T00:34:10,Twokinds,The bard was the real hero
03-02-2019T00:34:13,qwe304,didnt yall have spells or stuff to help him?
03-02-2019T00:34:18,Dadrobit,As is tradition
03-02-2019T00:34:24,unsteddyphoenix,This is why Sorcerors > wizards
03-02-2019T00:34:31,unsteddyphoenix,Bards too
03-02-2019T00:34:32,Ordithus,They always are
03-02-2019T00:34:34,Twokinds,His debuffs screwed the other party
03-02-2019T00:35:02,unsteddyphoenix,"Cant cast a spell on someone on a different plane of existence, generally"
03-02-2019T00:35:18,Twokinds,"Telling jokes making them laugh so they kept losing their turn, slowing them, stunning them."
03-02-2019T00:35:38,unsteddyphoenix,Lmao
03-02-2019T00:35:42,unsteddyphoenix,Who was playing it?
03-02-2019T00:35:47,unsteddyphoenix,Did they tell jokes IRL?
03-02-2019T00:35:50,Twokinds,lol
03-02-2019T00:35:51,Twokinds,No
03-02-2019T00:35:57,Twokinds,Unfortunately not
03-02-2019T00:36:03,unsteddyphoenix,Thats...theyre not playing it right!
03-02-2019T00:36:03,Ordithus,Aww
03-02-2019T00:36:09,Twokinds,Oh yeah and Mihari was also a big help
03-02-2019T00:36:21,unsteddyphoenix,What does she play?
03-02-2019T00:36:30,Twokinds,I took a huge amount of damage right off the bat due to a sneak attack first round.
03-02-2019T00:36:33,Dadrobit,"If the bard isn't busting out a jaunty tune for every proper occasion irl, you need a new bard."
03-02-2019T00:36:47,Twokinds,"She's the alchemist that makes potions, but she also has the shield and the healing."
03-02-2019T00:36:57,Twokinds,So my monk hid behind her shield a LOT.
03-02-2019T00:37:10,unsteddyphoenix,Why didnt you just defend patiently?
03-02-2019T00:37:28,Twokinds,SURPRISE ROUND
03-02-2019T00:37:39,unsteddyphoenix,:OOOOO
03-02-2019T00:37:45,Twokinds,Took half my life
03-02-2019T00:37:56,Dadrobit,"Is the person moving at 30m/sec really gonna be the ""patient"" person anyways?"
03-02-2019T00:38:10,Ordithus,"Duck out, punch someone, duck back in, repeat"
03-02-2019T00:38:20,unsteddyphoenix,"He moves fast, but always looks calm while doing it"
03-02-2019T00:38:25,Twokinds,"But outside of that, I was prioritizing flurries and stunning strikes to patient defense"
03-02-2019T00:38:39,Twokinds,My character is a hot head and prefers to go fast to being patient
03-02-2019T00:38:39,Dadrobit,Literally one punch man
03-02-2019T00:38:44,Dadrobit,(wo)man
03-02-2019T00:39:00,unsteddyphoenix,Lol I see. Fighting in character is ideal.

03-02-2019T00:48:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m too young to be so forgetful

03-02-2019T01:30:24,unsteddyphoenix,Oh. Then whyd you wanna end the stream early?
03-02-2019T01:30:30,unsteddyphoenix,Just cause of photoshop spazzing out?
03-02-2019T01:31:41,Justinblazer,You sure know how to like so much artwork often kinds
03-02-2019T01:33:12,Twokinds,I am tired.
03-02-2019T01:33:58,unsteddyphoenix,...
03-02-2019T01:34:09,unsteddyphoenix,Understandable :)
03-02-2019T01:34:16,Twokinds,But not sleepy.
03-02-2019T01:35:27,unsteddyphoenix,Huh
03-02-2019T01:35:33,unsteddyphoenix,Thats an unfortunate state to be in
03-02-2019T01:37:46,Twokinds,I'm just too lazy to go to bed.
03-02-2019T01:38:41,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
03-02-2019T01:38:51,unsteddyphoenix,A shame you dont have anything to procrastinate on
03-02-2019T01:38:57,unsteddyphoenix,That always gets me right to bed
03-02-2019T02:10:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve decided to finish this video
03-02-2019T02:10:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Then try bed
03-02-2019T02:10:49,Twokinds,"Hey, you're supposed to be in bed, Kiwi!"
03-02-2019T02:10:58,SpazztasticKiwi,"Pot, meet kettle"
03-02-2019T02:11:00,unsteddyphoenix,Man everyones strugglin' tonight huh
03-02-2019T02:11:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera has stolen my pillow

03-02-2019T02:11:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Oddly enough I’ve done that before
03-02-2019T02:12:01,SpazztasticKiwi,He doesn’t seem to care
03-02-2019T02:12:21,unsteddyphoenix,Welp
03-02-2019T02:12:24,unsteddyphoenix,ONe thing to do then
03-02-2019T02:14:17,iliar,"Tom, you're supposed to be in bed too. Punish Alexa. She's not doing her job well."
03-02-2019T02:14:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Only problem is sometimes I breathe in one too many cat hairs and sneeze
03-02-2019T02:14:42,SpazztasticKiwi,He always acts like I insulted his great ancestors
03-02-2019T02:15:18,SpazztasticKiwi,They say when you can’t sleep it’s cause someone is thinking about you
03-02-2019T02:15:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Or an enemy is nearby
03-02-2019T02:16:04,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d like to formally tell who or whatever it is to bugger off
03-02-2019T02:18:01,unsteddyphoenix,Good practise for sleeping with someone with long hair
03-02-2019T02:18:10,unsteddyphoenix,Gets all up and in your mouth all the time
03-02-2019T02:18:55,Bgrmystr2,the cat looks insulted cuz you woke em up
03-02-2019T02:19:18,Bgrmystr2,but they wouldn't have that issue if your face wasn't full of cat fur
03-02-2019T02:19:19,Bgrmystr2,so.
03-02-2019T02:19:26,Bgrmystr2,sounds like that's what they get.
03-02-2019T02:19:35,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-wondering:
03-02-2019T02:23:08,SpazztasticKiwi,He’s a shorthair. It’s normally not a problem - he’s a rather warm lil squish
03-02-2019T02:25:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Good bedwarmer. Especially considering I don’t have another substitute
03-02-2019T02:28:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Like a furry live teddy bear 🐻
03-02-2019T02:33:12,SpazztasticKiwi,So Tom since Alexa did a bad job tonight you gonna bring her into the office to discuss work performance?

03-02-2019T12:47:20,Twokinds,whoops
03-02-2019T12:59:15,Dadrobit,"Evidentially the dude who made the suggestion is super unhappy about that. Dunno what he expected though. Keidrans are just variations of anthro animals and it is an anthro cheetah. Mihari is just... I dunno, fitting as far as anything's concerned yeah?"
03-02-2019T13:04:48,Twokinds,Sigh
03-02-2019T13:05:56,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
03-02-2019T13:10:41,Dadrobit,"I mean, she's been seen inside of the TK proper before no? There was a painting of her by Eric, so it's kinda sorta almost maybe but not really canon anyways?"
03-02-2019T13:11:08,Twokinds,Sometimes I suspect people use sketch suggestions just to get me to draw new characters and sneak around the no OC rule.
03-02-2019T13:11:32,Twokinds,"""Draw me a cheetah... no, an ORIGINAL cheetah. Or OC for short."""
03-02-2019T13:13:04,anonlooker,"What about the time you drew a Lynx, Lioness and Panther character? Where those not original?"
03-02-2019T13:14:48,Twokinds,Not the point.
03-02-2019T13:15:25,iliar,"But if I understand correctly paper sketch suggestions have not ""no OC"" rule?"
03-02-2019T13:15:40,iliar,Right?
03-02-2019T13:15:47,BadFoMo,It does.
03-02-2019T13:16:27,BadFoMo,"I mean, there is a no OC rule."
03-02-2019T13:17:31,iliar,"I think Tom mean that some people try create fursona use ""another one Keidran"" sketch suggestions."
03-02-2019T13:18:36,anonlooker,Ah.
03-02-2019T13:19:11,iliar,BadFoMo: I mean paper sketches. Not sunday sketches.
03-02-2019T13:20:09,BadFoMo,Like the ones at Cons? I... don't know. Tom?
03-02-2019T13:20:52,Dadrobit,"It's a little pile of ""it depends"". Yeah, there are a few con sketches of different folks, but they're very few and far between. Generally, the character needs to be someone very well established like Mihari or a character from another well known comic."
03-02-2019T13:21:21,Dadrobit,Or the odd gift art like Neon being tended to by Kat.
03-02-2019T13:21:39,TerraTheWizard,who actually is mihari?

03-02-2019T13:21:52,TerraTheWizard,oh
03-02-2019T13:21:56,TerraTheWizard,ok then
03-02-2019T13:21:58,BadFoMo,"I know he has drawn OCs at Cons, but I don't know if thoes are sold or are just for friends."
03-02-2019T13:23:22,BadFoMo,...And late as per the norm.
03-02-2019T13:23:31,Dadrobit,There are maybe less than a dozen total publicly known Non-TK related sketches. And half of those are just Neon and Mihari.
03-02-2019T13:23:41,anonlooker,"I assumed the person wanted ""How Tom would draw Cheetahs in TK?"" when they made the suggestion."
03-02-2019T13:24:58,iliar,"If I'm not mistaken, Neon has never been on a сons"
03-02-2019T13:25:16,BadFoMo,They haven't?
03-02-2019T13:26:23,Dadrobit,"Ah, I have a double version of one for Neon in two separate years."
03-02-2019T13:26:55,Dadrobit,"Regardless, very very VERY few people have gotten OC's done by Tom. Even paying in person."
03-02-2019T13:27:51,anonlooker,Then I have a question about this sunday sketch: https://www.patreon.com/posts/lynx-14485979
03-02-2019T13:28:37,anonlooker,Is it original or not?
03-02-2019T13:29:47,iliar,I think asking Tom to draw their characters is a waste of money. I mean when OC + Tom's character it's okay (like Neon and Kat). But only OC... I don't understand why people ask about this.
03-02-2019T13:30:41,iliar,"And I think it's reason why ""only OC"" sketches so rarity."
03-02-2019T13:31:29,Dadrobit,"Simple solution. Erase one of the rings on Mihari's tail, and put a big arrow pointing at the ""New Tiger Keidran"" saying ""Definitely Not Mihari""."
03-02-2019T13:32:03,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
03-02-2019T13:32:04,anonlooker,I have nothing against the OC rule whatsoever. Artist's rule and it's a fair one.
03-02-2019T13:32:13,BadFoMo,Same.
03-02-2019T13:33:42,Twokinds,"Of course, the easiest way to get me to draw OCs is to start a webcomic and get me to draw fanart for it XD"
03-02-2019T13:33:50,Twokinds,Loophole!
03-02-2019T13:34:43,anonlooker,The hardest part would have to be getting your attention and making a good webcomic.
03-02-2019T13:35:11,Twokinds,lol yeah not exactly the easy way.
03-02-2019T13:36:29,iliar,Hmmm.... For some reason I think come to the con easily than create comic.
03-02-2019T13:36:44,SpazztasticKiwi,But what if it’s a webcomic with characters you have little experience with
03-02-2019T13:36:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Like fish people
03-02-2019T13:37:15,Dadrobit,I'm gonna start a new webcomic about an anthropomorphic cheetah. But she's tragically and ironically a parapalegic and has to get around using a wheelchair.
03-02-2019T13:37:33,BadFoMo,"Not to sound like a 'Tom never does anything wrong' fan-boy, but maybe the next try could be 'Male Cheetah Keidran'. Inb4 it's Mihari with a TG collar or the CheetahMen from Action 52."
03-02-2019T13:38:34,TerraTheWizard,"""I'll start my own webcomic! With blackjack! and cheetahs!"
03-02-2019T13:38:36,TerraTheWizard,""""
03-02-2019T13:38:57,Dadrobit,TIL: Action 52. How horrifying
03-02-2019T13:39:05,anonlooker,Or Cheetah from Detective Comics.
03-02-2019T13:39:12,BadFoMo,TIL?
03-02-2019T13:39:24,anonlooker,Today I Learned
03-02-2019T13:39:34,BadFoMo,Thank you.
03-02-2019T13:40:28,anonlooker,"Honestly, if I hypothetically were to make a webcomic that had good enough art for Tom to do fanart, the real reward is the fact you can do art."
03-02-2019T13:40:40,anonlooker,Tom doing fanart in his art style is a bonus.
03-02-2019T13:40:44,Dadrobit,Cheetara or gtfo
03-02-2019T13:41:38,anonlooker,Needs more fur.
03-02-2019T13:43:29,BadFoMo,"@anonlooker There's the big... thing. I mean, if I could draw, why would I be bothering with Tom/voter?"
03-02-2019T13:45:34,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
03-02-2019T13:47:38,anonlooker,"Unless you really like his art style but then again, people imitating other artists' art styles has been a practice for forever."
03-02-2019T13:48:19,anonlooker,Look at how many fans can draw Dragon Ball as exactly like the manga/anime.
03-02-2019T13:53:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Work time. I shall return eventually
03-02-2019T13:53:17,BadFoMo,Bye.
03-02-2019T13:55:05,CrimsonQuill,Good evening everyone.
03-02-2019T13:55:14,BadFoMo,Yo.
03-02-2019T13:56:07,CrimsonQuill,Did Dadrobit's Book club get Tom picked last night?
03-02-2019T13:56:26,Xexanoth,yeah
03-02-2019T13:56:36,CrimsonQuill,Ooooh. He'll be happy.
03-02-2019T13:56:41,Xexanoth,but he didn't draw it on stream because of the photoshop problems
03-02-2019T13:56:43,BadFoMo,I think it did. But it hasn't been shown yet.
03-02-2019T13:56:47,anonlooker,Neat.
03-02-2019T13:56:59,CrimsonQuill,"Oh, did Photoshop have a tantrum?"
03-02-2019T13:57:01,BadFoMo,Late as always.
03-02-2019T13:57:21,BadFoMo,@CrimsonQuill Yep.
03-02-2019T13:57:23,Xexanoth,"which reminds me, Tom did reinstalling Photoshop help?"
03-02-2019T13:58:14,CrimsonQuill,I wouldn't know.
03-02-2019T13:58:38,CrimsonQuill,"I want to shout ""yes"" in block capitals in the chat that book club was picked, but I won't."
03-02-2019T13:58:47,CrimsonQuill,I've always rooted for that suggestion.
03-02-2019T13:59:43,CrimsonQuill,I rather like the Mihari one that was done.
03-02-2019T14:01:51,CrimsonQuill,"How long does cooldown last again? Four weeks, or five?"
03-02-2019T14:02:08,CrimsonQuill,Because I want to know how many Sunday nights that I'll be sleeping early on.
03-02-2019T14:02:50,BadFoMo,One (1) week.
03-02-2019T14:03:09,CrimsonQuill,Just one?
03-02-2019T14:03:11,CrimsonQuill,Oh.
03-02-2019T14:03:15,BadFoMo,Just one.
03-02-2019T14:03:17,CrimsonQuill,That's interesting.
03-02-2019T14:03:22,CrimsonQuill,Hmmm....
03-02-2019T14:03:34,CrimsonQuill,"Well, I can sketch some more of my stuff anyhow"
03-02-2019T14:03:44,CrimsonQuill,I have loads of ideas to fill my sketchpad
03-02-2019T14:03:53,Xexanoth,"i still feel like there where so many better suggestions in the poll then just ""cheetah"" especially since Tom has drawn color stuff of that already :/"
03-02-2019T14:03:55,CrimsonQuill,I just need to ban myself from all video games forever
03-02-2019T14:04:48,BadFoMo,"@Xexanoth Sorry to say it, but I feel the same way."
03-02-2019T14:04:56,CrimsonQuill,I rather liked the HTTYD one.
03-02-2019T14:05:13,BadFoMo,HTTYD?
03-02-2019T14:05:27,CrimsonQuill,THe How to Train your Dragon crossover
03-02-2019T14:05:30,BadFoMo,Never mind.
03-02-2019T14:05:35,CrimsonQuill,With Trace and Flora on Toothless
03-02-2019T14:05:39,BadFoMo,Late again.
03-02-2019T14:05:41,CrimsonQuill,"Too late, BadFoMo"
03-02-2019T14:06:10,CrimsonQuill,"I liked the Cheetah one, but I also liked that Keidran Collar thing-that would've been funny."
03-02-2019T14:06:35,BadFoMo,...Got Ninja-ed and I Ninja-ed.
03-02-2019T14:06:43,CrimsonQuill,And the Basitins in Nora's cave....
03-02-2019T14:06:51,CrimsonQuill,"Oh, that would've been hilarious."

03-02-2019T14:12:31,CrimsonQuill,I'm off to Middle Earth.
03-02-2019T14:12:36,CrimsonQuill,The films are very long.
03-02-2019T14:12:43,CrimsonQuill,Especially in the extended versions.

03-02-2019T17:08:38,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-RaineEep:
03-02-2019T17:10:52,unsteddyphoenix,Why is anyone taking this guys side in this lol
03-02-2019T17:11:05,unsteddyphoenix,How bizzare
03-02-2019T17:11:08,unsteddyphoenix,Also yo
03-02-2019T17:12:28,Dadrobit,o/ unsteddy
03-02-2019T17:13:30,Dadrobit,"While I would assert that there is indeed somewhat an unwritten expectation of Tom to put a firm effort into honoring and executing on the authors' intentions of their suggestions where possible, in this case I think he was totally fine."
03-02-2019T17:13:44,Dadrobit,"Van put an incredibly vague suggestion into the mix, ""Cheetah Keidran"" and it's more than fair for Tom to have interpreted that as someone wanting to see more of the ""Cheetah Keidran"" that was cameo'd on page 942."
03-02-2019T17:14:19,TerraTheWizard,i kinda noped out of all this drama
03-02-2019T17:14:20,Dadrobit,"Like, if he wanted another ""village"" saga, all he had to do was literally just add that to the end of his suggestion."
03-02-2019T17:14:34,Dadrobit,"""Cheetah Keidran Village"". Fucking easy."
03-02-2019T17:14:40,TerraTheWizard,people started hating on mhiari for no reason
03-02-2019T17:14:50,TerraTheWizard,i can't spell
03-02-2019T17:14:56,unsteddyphoenix,"Where is the discord ""drama"" is it in the one im not in?"
03-02-2019T17:15:06,TerraTheWizard,it's not on discord
03-02-2019T17:15:17,TerraTheWizard,unless it's in dms
03-02-2019T17:15:22,Dadrobit,It's in the TKGC one.
03-02-2019T17:15:41,unsteddyphoenix,Ahh
03-02-2019T17:15:45,TerraTheWizard,well there was a few messages but we got them to take it to dms
03-02-2019T17:15:53,TerraTheWizard,because heck no
03-02-2019T17:16:00,unsteddyphoenix,"Also, yeah. Tom fufilled the exact sketch request???"
03-02-2019T17:16:22,unsteddyphoenix,Why couldnt it be Mihari
03-02-2019T17:16:46,unsteddyphoenix,The only reason I can think of for this is they...just hate Mihari?
03-02-2019T17:17:00,Dadrobit,Pretty much.
03-02-2019T17:17:52,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
03-02-2019T17:17:58,unsteddyphoenix,How unfortunate
03-02-2019T17:18:19,TerraTheWizard,"yeah, people really hate mihari for some reason"
03-02-2019T17:18:21,TerraTheWizard,i don't get it
03-02-2019T17:18:42,Dadrobit,"I don't even think Korben was the one who was most upset? All I see from his comments is ""ah well, lesson learned, next time I'll specify ""not Mihari""."
03-02-2019T17:19:12,TerraTheWizard,mm
03-02-2019T17:20:12,Dadrobit,It's fun to hate popular things I guess?
03-02-2019T17:20:53,TerraTheWizard,darn angry hipsters
03-02-2019T17:20:58,TerraTheWizard,ruining the fandom
03-02-2019T17:21:03,TerraTheWizard,*shakes fist*
03-02-2019T17:22:08,Dadrobit,Speaking of hating popular things.
03-02-2019T17:22:25,Dadrobit,I think KH3 is gonna be a GameStop trade in when I'm finished.
03-02-2019T17:23:32,unsteddyphoenix,But...so many years in waiting!
03-02-2019T17:23:44,TerraTheWizard,it got problems?
03-02-2019T17:24:39,Dadrobit,"You'd think with such a long development, they'd have found the time to make it polished, but it really just feels super low effort."
03-02-2019T17:26:09,unsteddyphoenix,:(
03-02-2019T17:26:11,Dadrobit,"Bad voice acting, crap pacing, and zero effort cut scene animations were understandable and cute 15 years ago. But now? It just feels bad."
03-02-2019T17:26:11,TerraTheWizard,oof
03-02-2019T17:26:12,unsteddyphoenix,Unfortunate
03-02-2019T17:26:20,ThingsAreMoving,o/
03-02-2019T17:26:22,unsteddyphoenix,But it has Captain Jack sparrow?
03-02-2019T17:26:23,unsteddyphoenix,Yo
03-02-2019T17:26:24,TerraTheWizard,hi things
03-02-2019T17:26:24,Dadrobit,o/ Things
03-02-2019T17:27:24,Dadrobit,"Legit, the Pirates world is the only one that had me go ""whoa, that's awesome""."
03-02-2019T17:27:25,ThingsAreMoving,":ctwokinds-kingtea: don't mind me, continue your rant on KH3, Dad"
03-02-2019T17:28:17,Dadrobit,"Because they either ACTUALLY used mocap to get the animations, or they did some 3d roto-scoping to get it right, because they got it right there."
03-02-2019T17:28:37,unsteddyphoenix,nice~
03-02-2019T17:28:45,unsteddyphoenix,But the rest werent up to par huh...
03-02-2019T17:28:58,Dadrobit,But Sora and the gang have all of half a different animation cycles they used to fill out every single cut scene.
03-02-2019T17:29:52,Dadrobit,"*Relaxed Stance"" *Gestures vaguely with hands stance* *Hands one head stance* *Return to relaxed stance*"
03-02-2019T17:30:08,Dadrobit,The exact same animations. Every. Single. Time.
03-02-2019T17:30:57,Dadrobit,Sometimes they throw in a *Confused head shake* and a *Takes step back in surprise* in there to shake it up.
03-02-2019T17:31:24,unsteddyphoenix,Thats very...japanese really.
03-02-2019T17:31:33,unsteddyphoenix,Lot of japan games do that type of thnig
03-02-2019T17:31:57,Dadrobit,"And because they need to have a cut scene every two minutes, it gets super old, suuuuuuper quick."
03-02-2019T17:33:50,Dadrobit,"Sure, but this isn't just some Japanese visual novel (as much as it tries to be). It's friggin Square Enix. You'd think that after FFXV they'd be all for good animation cyles?"
03-02-2019T17:34:25,Dadrobit,"Even that had repetition, but at least they had the common courtesy to make them fluid."
03-02-2019T17:34:43,Dadrobit,KH3 animation transitions are some janky shit man.
03-02-2019T17:36:24,unsteddyphoenix,"Hm, how weird"
03-02-2019T17:36:24,Dadrobit,Then there's the combat that is some of the most brain dead combat Ive ever seen.
03-02-2019T17:36:31,unsteddyphoenix,Ahh I heard that
03-02-2019T17:36:35,unsteddyphoenix,Really dumbed down
03-02-2019T17:36:56,Dadrobit,Has it been 5 seconds? Here have an action button cut scene attack.
03-02-2019T17:37:40,Dadrobit,"Legit, I'll be mere seconds into any given fight, and I'll have four separate ""cut scene attacks"" stacked up to use on my sidebar."
03-02-2019T17:38:26,unsteddyphoenix,Oh really? Thats what they went with?
03-02-2019T17:38:28,Dadrobit,And now I avoid them like the plague because TWICE now I've had fights glitch out after using one.
03-02-2019T17:38:32,unsteddyphoenix,I hate those things
03-02-2019T17:38:53,unsteddyphoenix,Unless theyre rare like overdrives I dont even bother with them
03-02-2019T17:39:18,Dadrobit,Nothing kills engagement like main story boss fights having the player turn off the game completely to escape a glitch.
03-02-2019T17:40:04,Dadrobit,"Overdrives, but totally free to use."
03-02-2019T17:40:16,Dadrobit,All of the time.
03-02-2019T17:40:47,unsteddyphoenix,Oh no. That aint it.

03-02-2019T17:41:28,unsteddyphoenix,"Wait theyre not just, with you?"
03-02-2019T17:41:34,Dadrobit,"Yeah, they are."
03-02-2019T17:42:01,Dadrobit,"But every few seconds, they offer one of those cut scene attacks for you to use."
03-02-2019T17:42:29,Dadrobit,Press triangle to kill everything but monsters with more than four bars.
03-02-2019T17:43:51,Dadrobit,And don't even think about trying to make the game harder by forcing skill checks on yourself by using parries. Because that is broken as fuck.
03-02-2019T17:43:55,Mippy,I need indoor mittens :ctwokinds-sadtrace2: unfortunately I am not a Snep
03-02-2019T17:44:35,Dadrobit,"Monsters and especially bosses see parrying as more of a suggestion to be stunlocked for a counter, more than an actual rule."
03-02-2019T17:44:49,Dadrobit,I've completely given up on parrying.
03-02-2019T17:45:18,unsteddyphoenix,"""Pleased be stunned"" ""I'll think about it, no"
03-02-2019T17:45:26,Dadrobit,Get a parry. Engage the counter attack. Still get hit because the mosnter gets to keep attacking.
03-02-2019T17:45:31,Dadrobit,monster*
03-02-2019T17:45:56,Dadrobit,Screw it. Just dodge and press the action button for an auto-win.
03-02-2019T17:47:27,unsteddyphoenix,Hmm
03-02-2019T17:47:36,unsteddyphoenix,I wonder if this games getting bad reviews
03-02-2019T17:47:39,Dadrobit,"But don't worry about getting hit really. If your HP falls too low, just hit the action button to turn into Demon Sora, restore all of your hp, and one hit blink attack everything for 20 seconds."
03-02-2019T17:47:54,Dadrobit,Probably not.
03-02-2019T17:47:57,unsteddyphoenix,Sounds like a big let down
03-02-2019T17:48:15,unsteddyphoenix,No matter how cool other aspects of a game is if the gameplay is bad its over
03-02-2019T17:48:46,Dadrobit,The story is pretty balls too.
03-02-2019T17:49:31,Dadrobit,"I'm used to the Disney Worlds not mattering to the overall game, but KH3 has taken it to the next level of Sora not even mattering in most of them either."
03-02-2019T17:50:42,Dadrobit,An overwhelming majority of the worlds are just straight one to one repeats of the movie they're based off of.
03-02-2019T17:50:58,Dadrobit,And Sora is just kind of along for the ride.
03-02-2019T17:51:56,Dadrobit,"I haven't yet finished the main story, but that too is kinda .... Ehhhhhh~"
03-02-2019T17:52:36,Dadrobit,It's just all over the place making sure that it includes references to everything in all of the spin-off games.
03-02-2019T17:53:35,Dadrobit,It legitimately took until I finished the main stories of all the Disney worlds before any real progress was made at all towards Sora's story.
03-02-2019T17:55:03,Dadrobit,"Because Sora went to the Metroid School of Losing All Your Abilities, the first huge portion of the game is just spent ""recover your power and then we'll do something story related""."
03-02-2019T17:55:43,Dadrobit,"""Until then, have a bunch of cutscenes just trying to establish all of the story you missed in the side games."""
03-02-2019T18:06:48,Dadrobit,"Oh! And all of the Final Fantasy characters are gone, and there's no Colosseum arena anymore either."
03-02-2019T18:07:44,Dadrobit,"I'm seeing a lot of 8s and 9s from reviewers, but I wouldn't give it higher than a 6 or 7 myself honestly..."
03-02-2019T18:08:26,Dadrobit,More leaning towards a 6.
03-02-2019T18:13:39,unsteddyphoenix,Whaat
03-02-2019T18:13:42,unsteddyphoenix,No FF characters?
03-02-2019T18:13:47,unsteddyphoenix,Did they lose the rights?
03-02-2019T18:13:51,unsteddyphoenix,Terrible! D:
03-02-2019T18:15:26,Dadrobit,It's fucking Square Enix. How they didn't get the rights to reuse their own character is utterly beyond me!
03-02-2019T18:16:42,Dadrobit,"I mean, the entire premise of Kingdom Hearts was created on it being a crossover of Final Fantasy characters and design with Disney, but I guess I'm just not smart enough to understand?"
03-02-2019T18:16:57,unsteddyphoenix,Something something beurocracy?
03-02-2019T18:18:30,Dadrobit,Something Something investors prioritizing Disney IP over SE.
03-02-2019T18:19:58,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m on lunch
03-02-2019T18:20:21,SpazztasticKiwi,As entertaining as that information is
03-02-2019T18:20:38,unsteddyphoenix,congrats on the lunch
03-02-2019T18:21:26,SpazztasticKiwi,And you know I got a math problem to run by you
03-02-2019T18:21:35,Dadrobit,42
03-02-2019T18:22:08,SpazztasticKiwi,"If I have 38 hours this time period, but that’s only accounting for today’s shift being 5:30 to 10:00,"
03-02-2019T18:22:27,Dadrobit,short shift!
03-02-2019T18:22:51,SpazztasticKiwi,is me coming in at 1:00 instead not raising that 38 hours by 4 1/2 hours?
03-02-2019T18:23:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Making it 42.5 - i.e. overtime
03-02-2019T18:23:11,Dadrobit,Depends on if you took lunch.
03-02-2019T18:23:25,Dadrobit,"Well, yeah, that would still put you over 40"
03-02-2019T18:23:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Welp
03-02-2019T18:23:58,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s what mr manager was trying to avoid
03-02-2019T18:24:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Which is why we spend like 20ish minutes changing my schedule yesterday
03-02-2019T18:24:38,SpazztasticKiwi,That and it was completely kerfuckeled
03-02-2019T18:26:32,Bgrmystr2,lol... expecting something good out of square enix. Tis the first mistake right there.
03-02-2019T18:26:56,Dadrobit,2.5 hours isn't terrible. Enjoy the extra $40 I guess?
03-02-2019T18:27:50,SpazztasticKiwi,They get mega shook when anyone gets overtime
03-02-2019T18:28:16,SpazztasticKiwi,I suspect they’ll try changing something to avoid it if they can
03-02-2019T18:28:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Otherwise some higher ups are gonna be the equivalent of vibrating Flora
03-02-2019T18:28:57,Dadrobit,I actually wasn't super hyped in the first place for KH3. I had very tempered expectation. Especially considering the super long development cycle. I'm always wary of these kinds of games and their potential for dissapointment.
03-02-2019T18:29:07,Dadrobit,disappointment*
03-02-2019T18:29:16,Dadrobit,expectations*
03-02-2019T18:30:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Good news is they won’t be salty at me. They’ll be at my manager
03-02-2019T18:32:31,Dadrobit,Yep. That sounds like retail.
03-02-2019T18:33:11,Bgrmystr2,maybe your manager will actually listen to what time you can't come into work instead of blowing you off like a dumbass
03-02-2019T18:33:13,Dadrobit,I recall being forced to go home while pulling an extra shift even when the store was being barraged by snowbirds because the managers refused to give overtime.
03-02-2019T18:33:55,Dadrobit,And then the next week I'd be missing a shift so that my average time stayed low enough that I wouldn't be a candidate for health insurance.
03-02-2019T18:33:59,Bgrmystr2,At first I thought you meant actual birds.
03-02-2019T18:34:06,Bgrmystr2,and then I remembered
03-02-2019T18:34:39,Dadrobit,"Yep, those people."
03-02-2019T18:37:54,SpazztasticKiwi,I honestly pictured a penguin with a shopping basket
03-02-2019T18:39:09,SpazztasticKiwi,"Thing is, manager was on vacation. So the schedule he fixed was made by someone else (who evidently didn’t look at availability or give a frack)"
03-02-2019T18:39:42,Bgrmystr2,ooooh
03-02-2019T18:39:46,Bgrmystr2,okay I take it back then
03-02-2019T18:39:59,Bgrmystr2,so is this manager actually competent?
03-02-2019T18:40:22,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m not sure he realizes what me coming in early today and therefore racking my hours up a bit means overtime though
03-02-2019T18:40:39,SpazztasticKiwi,what = ~that~
03-02-2019T18:40:48,SpazztasticKiwi,English is my first language I swear
03-02-2019T18:42:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"It’s why I was thinking on the math last night. But who knows. He did mention that with who quit recently, this would have to be the standing if they questioned him"
03-02-2019T18:51:03,SpazztasticKiwi,"So based on this possible missed math in an effort to avoid overtime yet it still happened, I dunno - is he a competent manager"
03-02-2019T18:52:21,Bgrmystr2,I mean.. trading one bomb for another
03-02-2019T18:52:28,Bgrmystr2,but seems better than the other
03-02-2019T18:53:01,Bgrmystr2,active ignorance is worse than accidental ignorance

03-02-2019T22:08:52,CrRAR,oranges got electrolytes too ya know
03-02-2019T22:09:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Cutting sugar is basically impossible. Natural sugars are what you get. Not the coke and ice cream sugar
03-02-2019T22:09:23,Dadrobit,"greens, rye bread, and nuts for the fiber yo"
03-02-2019T22:09:37,CrRAR,"But really, I alwats just thing anyone who avoids soda like some soda fiends are already WAYYY ahead of the curve."
03-02-2019T22:09:42,CrRAR,*think
03-02-2019T22:09:55,Ordithus,"Sugar in fruit should be fine, just don't drink fruit juice"
03-02-2019T22:10:24,Ordithus,Fruit has plenty of fiber to prevent the blood sugar spike
03-02-2019T22:10:29,Dadrobit,"Sugars are sugars. ""Natural"" or otherwise."
03-02-2019T22:11:07,Ordithus,Calories are also calories... except when they aren't
03-02-2019T22:11:11,SpazztasticKiwi,So anything happenin Tom
03-02-2019T22:11:16,CrRAR,Pectin: high QUALITY saccharide.
03-02-2019T22:11:19,SpazztasticKiwi,If you’re even here
03-02-2019T22:11:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Drink a cup of prune juice each meal
03-02-2019T22:11:56,Dadrobit,"I still toss in a strawberry or two in the morning, but I'm really trying to get back into my middle teen health. The six pack will return, I swear it!"
03-02-2019T22:12:06,CrRAR,:9
03-02-2019T22:13:34,Dadrobit,Down to 182. Want to hit 175 areas.
03-02-2019T22:13:55,CrRAR,PRIME range.
03-02-2019T22:14:05,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
03-02-2019T22:14:09,Dadrobit,"Will muscle mass, heck yeah."
03-02-2019T22:14:24,Dadrobit,With*
03-02-2019T22:16:59,CrRAR,"You know what they say: hit a lawyer, gym up, and (always, always) delete the facebook."
03-02-2019T22:17:31,CrRAR,or just hit a lawyer in the facebook. Cut to the chase.
03-02-2019T22:18:29,Dadrobit,"To be blunt, I think a lawyer is the last person you want to hit."
03-02-2019T22:18:35,Dadrobit,Lawsuits and all that
03-02-2019T22:20:53,RimaDraws,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/486633926408929281/542182709104214037/maddelyn.png this is all i can get
03-02-2019T22:21:26,Dadrobit,Maddie?
03-02-2019T22:21:50,RimaDraws,mhm went after an older version of her
03-02-2019T22:21:56,RimaDraws,used a ref
03-02-2019T22:22:07,Dadrobit,The dinner date?
03-02-2019T22:22:11,RimaDraws,uh no
03-02-2019T22:22:15,Dadrobit,Or the tavern?
03-02-2019T22:22:22,RimaDraws,its the color sketch of her helping in the tavern
03-02-2019T22:22:39,RimaDraws,the only reason it looks bad is because of my art block
03-02-2019T22:22:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Alrighty I gotta do some work videos but I’ll be back later
03-02-2019T22:23:12,Dadrobit,I never understood the obsession with making Maddie into girls.
03-02-2019T22:23:25,Dadrobit,And that looks better than most all of what I can put together.
03-02-2019T22:23:39,RimaDraws,well normally my stuff dont look this bad
03-02-2019T22:23:43,RimaDraws,this is just a warm up
03-02-2019T22:24:11,Dadrobit,"It's like folks totally forgot that she was originally ""creepy stalker girl"" because she was so into Keith."
03-02-2019T22:24:40,RimaDraws,well i didnt do younger maddie because i wanted something cute with her and maeve but it didnt work
03-02-2019T22:25:34,RimaDraws,i want to scrap this
03-02-2019T22:27:40,Ordithus,Looks nice to my eyes :ptv-hearts:
03-02-2019T22:27:57,RimaDraws,thanks
03-02-2019T22:28:06,Ordithus,:pear::ctwokinds-renirawr:
03-02-2019T22:28:27,Ordithus,I freakin love pears
03-02-2019T22:38:39,Ordithus,I think the Maddie x Maeve was an extension of all those sketchs where they were just being cute
03-02-2019T22:38:53,Ordithus,But I 'member when she was crushing on Keith
03-02-2019T22:41:19,CrRAR,That's adorable Rima!
03-02-2019T22:41:42,CrRAR,"Also, are baked pears a thing?"
03-02-2019T22:41:47,CrRAR,:thinking:
03-02-2019T22:42:07,CrRAR,"Never heard of pear pie, sound slogical though."
03-02-2019T22:42:26,Ordithus,"Just googled it.  It does exist.  Never had one, though."
03-02-2019T22:43:45,CrRAR,Apples must just be the one-up king to the pears' modest existence.
03-02-2019T22:43:45,Ordithus,Tom's teased at Maddie being at least curious for a while http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/895/ and http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/942/
03-02-2019T22:44:19,CrRAR,haha
03-02-2019T22:44:34,Dadrobit,I think that's just literal curiosity.
03-02-2019T22:44:52,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-maddiessparkles:*[So much to DISCOVER]
03-02-2019T22:45:23,Ordithus,Heh that's even where that emote came from
03-02-2019T22:45:56,CrRAR,lol tru
03-02-2019T22:46:16,Ordithus,"Yeah, true.  Not quite the same response as seeing Keith in the buff https://www.deviantart.com/twokinds/art/Breaking-Decency-Laws-682932218"
03-02-2019T22:47:31,CrRAR,"Venture a peek, reap what you seek~"
03-02-2019T23:15:30,Mippy,:ptv-ohmy:
03-02-2019T23:17:45,RimaDraws,oh well i guess ill scrap the art
03-02-2019T23:17:51,RimaDraws,i like it but eh
03-02-2019T23:21:04,Bgrmystr2,why would you scrap it?
03-02-2019T23:21:51,RimaDraws,for one it wouldnt go further
03-02-2019T23:22:12,RimaDraws,it would just stay a sketch. i dont know how well it would turn out
03-02-2019T23:22:37,Bgrmystr2,so.. you just gonna delete it forever just cuz  you dunno how to finish it?
03-02-2019T23:25:00,Ordithus,"Or do you mean art gallery ""scraps"""
03-02-2019T23:25:57,RimaDraws,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/486633926408929281/542199144559804436/maddelyn2.png
03-02-2019T23:26:05,RimaDraws,this is without the coloring of the grey scale
03-02-2019T23:28:15,RimaDraws,sorry just frustrated i have art block
03-02-2019T23:28:56,Bgrmystr2,I dunno? I think it looks like a great start
03-02-2019T23:29:11,RimaDraws,thanks. ill think about keeping it for now
03-02-2019T23:29:46,Bgrmystr2,"you should keep all of your old art, even if you don't like it"
03-02-2019T23:30:12,Bgrmystr2,"because one day down the line, it's a good idea to look at it and see how far you've come"
03-02-2019T23:30:12,Ordithus,^
03-02-2019T23:30:18,RimaDraws,oh i dont have all my old terrible digital art
03-02-2019T23:30:23,RimaDraws,i have some
03-02-2019T23:30:25,RimaDraws,but not all
03-02-2019T23:30:32,Bgrmystr2,"also, people will be interested in it."
03-02-2019T23:30:53,Bgrmystr2,Even now people still want to see tom's old art when he was first starting to draw
03-02-2019T23:31:26,RimaDraws,yea but his is alot better because his isn't being done in paint tool sai 2
03-02-2019T23:31:50,Ordithus,That's probably a much better tool for the job than photoshop
03-02-2019T23:32:03,Bgrmystr2,lol I don't think tom even had photoshop back when he first started twokinds
03-02-2019T23:32:10,Bgrmystr2,or even way before then
03-02-2019T23:32:22,Ordithus,Photoshop is like trying to cut a filet mignon with a hammer
03-02-2019T23:32:28,RimaDraws,i want to use photo shop but my hp wont allow it to work properly. plus its expensive
03-02-2019T23:32:38,Bgrmystr2,"twokinds started what, 14 years ago?"
03-02-2019T23:32:46,RimaDraws,2004?
03-02-2019T23:32:50,RimaDraws,no
03-02-2019T23:32:56,RimaDraws,2005
03-02-2019T23:32:57,Bgrmystr2,2005
03-02-2019T23:32:59,Bgrmystr2,yeah
03-02-2019T23:33:08,Ordithus,2003
03-02-2019T23:33:13,Ordithus,http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/1/
03-02-2019T23:33:16,RimaDraws,sorry im tired. i dozed off i feel like a train wreck
03-02-2019T23:33:19,RimaDraws,15 years ago
03-02-2019T23:33:19,Ordithus,10/22/03
03-02-2019T23:33:27,RimaDraws,almost sixteen now
03-02-2019T23:33:29,Bgrmystr2,then tom's website is outdated
03-02-2019T23:33:33,Bgrmystr2,cuz it still says 14 years
03-02-2019T23:33:46,Ordithus,It's always outdated
03-02-2019T23:34:30,Bgrmystr2,I remember when it just turned 14
03-02-2019T23:35:55,Bgrmystr2,I didn't start really getting into the community till late 2015 or so
03-02-2019T23:36:14,Bgrmystr2,it was around sept or somesuch
03-02-2019T23:36:21,Bgrmystr2,when I was watching tom stream
03-02-2019T23:37:03,RimaDraws,ive only been a fan since last year so i wouldnt know. crimson has been around since 09
03-02-2019T23:37:25,Bgrmystr2,I first found tom's comic probably around....
03-02-2019T23:37:26,Bgrmystr2,hmm
03-02-2019T23:37:32,Bgrmystr2,2004 I'd say?
03-02-2019T23:37:53,Bgrmystr2,but back then I was still going to high school
03-02-2019T23:37:55,RimaDraws,yea he said he found tom on deviantart as a featured artist i think
03-02-2019T23:38:18,Bgrmystr2,I just ended up finding the comic itself and read it
03-02-2019T23:38:28,Bgrmystr2,but I don't recall how far along it was back then
03-02-2019T23:38:36,RimaDraws,crimson got me into it and i was soon reading the pages within a week
03-02-2019T23:39:01,Ordithus,G'night fellas :cw0lfmare-EmberHide:
03-02-2019T23:39:10,RimaDraws,nighty ord
03-02-2019T23:39:26,Bgrmystr2,gnight ord
03-02-2019T23:40:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Only way I found this insanity was Mark
03-02-2019T23:40:51,RimaDraws,but i enjoy twokinds almost as much as crimson. it's a nice story and it always has me on the edge for the next page
03-02-2019T23:40:59,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also, someone brought a mini pig in Walmart"
03-02-2019T23:41:18,RimaDraws,oh wow
03-02-2019T23:41:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Better behaved than the kids we get
03-02-2019T23:41:54,RimaDraws,yea pigs are good pets . especially tea cup piggies
03-02-2019T23:44:58,RimaDraws,still maybe i am hoping to draw more art of the tk cast. and improve my art. somehow since i watched tom on how he does his art mine has improved a bit
03-02-2019T23:49:49,RimaDraws,i have learned a lot.
03-02-2019T23:52:01,Dadrobit,"Late to the conversation, but no. Tom did not have Photoshop. The comic was originally Black and white physical drawings that were scanned and uploaded."
03-02-2019T23:52:03,Dadrobit,https://i.imgur.com/qLowtz7.jpg
03-02-2019T23:52:49,RimaDraws,oh wow really
03-02-2019T23:52:57,RimaDraws,i always thought they were digital
03-02-2019T23:53:27,Dadrobit,It
03-02-2019T23:53:29,Dadrobit,It
03-02-2019T23:53:32,Dadrobit,Fuck
03-02-2019T23:53:54,Bgrmystr2,apostrophe is a bitch lol
03-02-2019T23:54:07,Dadrobit,It's fun to note the lack of stripes on Flora. Originally she was just a generic cat. But Tom made her a tiger for Halloween and it stuck.
03-02-2019T23:54:27,Dadrobit,And yes. Apostrophes happen...
03-02-2019T23:56:03,RimaDraws,yea i heard the flora story and found it interesting she was meant to be a orange cat
03-02-2019T23:56:52,Dadrobit,"Trace is actually just Jon with amnesia, and Flora is Tom's first genderbend. Of Garfield."
