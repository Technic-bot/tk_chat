16-03-2019T13:01:51,SpazztasticKiwi,"giving them a dummy or copy is essentially like giving them their own thing to “help”. Granted, it’s obvious they’re not helping work by just sitting on it but it’s how they interpret our fiddling with a computer"

16-03-2019T15:58:21,Combak,Yep
16-03-2019T15:58:27,CrimsonQuill,@RimaDraws I hate the taste of alcohol.
16-03-2019T15:58:38,CrimsonQuill,My mum gave me a bit to try when I was 18...
16-03-2019T15:58:38,Mippy,Neither am I Rima...can’t even if I wanted too.
16-03-2019T15:58:40,Bgrmystr2,you must hate a lot of tastes then Quill
16-03-2019T15:58:43,CrimsonQuill,Bleugh
16-03-2019T15:58:45,Bgrmystr2,cuz not every alchohol tastes the same
16-03-2019T15:58:48,RimaDraws,i drink sangria which is a sweet wine
16-03-2019T15:58:54,CrimsonQuill,@Bgrmystr2 I just prefer tea.
16-03-2019T15:58:59,ThingsAreMoving,if she gave you pure white spirit no wonder you disliked it
16-03-2019T15:58:59,CrimsonQuill,Tea is all I need.
16-03-2019T15:59:00,ThingsAreMoving,lol
16-03-2019T15:59:01,Bgrmystr2,woosh goes the point :)

16-03-2019T15:59:15,Mippy,Psychiatric meds...no alcohol for me.
16-03-2019T15:59:18,CrimsonQuill,I'm not really bothered anyhow
16-03-2019T15:59:28,CrimsonQuill,The only thing I'd use wine in is cooking.

16-03-2019T15:59:59,MuonNeutrino,two people whose names start with crimson XD
16-03-2019T16:00:06,RimaDraws,*gives cookie to muon* you are ok
16-03-2019T16:00:08,CrimsonQuill,I do have a crimson quill pen.
16-03-2019T16:00:13,CrimsonQuill,I bought it in Venice.
16-03-2019T16:00:17,RimaDraws,nice
16-03-2019T16:00:21,CrimsonQuill,My aunt got me sealing wax and a seal.
16-03-2019T16:00:24,Bgrmystr2,"One is Quill, one is Helsing, Muon."
16-03-2019T16:00:36,CrimsonQuill,I'm the silly one.
16-03-2019T16:00:40,Bgrmystr2,it's fairly easy to differenciate if you stop looking at the same word.
16-03-2019T16:00:42,Bgrmystr2,:)
16-03-2019T16:00:45,CrimsonQuill,With a peacock as my avatar.
16-03-2019T16:00:50,RimaDraws,yee
16-03-2019T16:00:54,ThingsAreMoving,one's nickname is blue other is red
16-03-2019T16:01:02,CrimsonQuill,"Actually, just today, Lucky was showing his feathers."
16-03-2019T16:01:04,Mippy,"Yeah, Helsing is lesss.....something"
16-03-2019T16:01:13,CrimsonQuill,A beautiful display.
16-03-2019T16:01:15,MuonNeutrino,@Bgrmystr2 the problem is when i'm doing the @-type partial name-tab autocomplete thing if i just type @crims and then hit tab it fills in the wrong person's name
16-03-2019T16:01:15,RimaDraws,i let helsing know you didnt mean to tag him
16-03-2019T16:01:21,CrimsonQuill,I called my brother to get the camera.
16-03-2019T16:01:25,Bgrmystr2,a lot of things mippy xD

16-03-2019T16:01:47,Bgrmystr2,"oh does it Muon, that sounds like an autofill problem"
16-03-2019T16:01:47,CrimsonQuill,hello orion
16-03-2019T16:01:49,Bgrmystr2,you should fix that lol
16-03-2019T16:01:55,ThingsAreMoving,yo Rima
16-03-2019T16:01:59,RimaDraws,how's it
16-03-2019T16:02:07,ThingsAreMoving,stagnating
16-03-2019T16:02:30,CrimsonQuill,"So, Nora is seeing that Trace isn't just eye-candy here."
16-03-2019T16:02:30,ThingsAreMoving,but I think I have a plan on how to proceed from this point in time
16-03-2019T16:02:32,CrimsonQuill,I like it.
16-03-2019T16:02:35,MuonNeutrino,"@Bgrmystr2 well it just means i have to type enough of the name to get past the point where the two are the same, so i have to type @crimsonq before i hit tab, i just wasn't expecting there to be two people whose names are similar to that length"
16-03-2019T16:03:01,Bgrmystr2,"lool.. you've been here long enough though. There's plenty of ppl that happened to.,"
16-03-2019T16:03:02,Combak,"Wait, Picarto has autocomplete?"
16-03-2019T16:03:05,MuonNeutrino,yup
16-03-2019T16:03:06,Bgrmystr2,Crimson isn't the first
16-03-2019T16:03:09,ThingsAreMoving,"Gonna go to my home country for a while, renew my ID card cause it's expiring soon. Then I'll come back and seriously search for a job"
16-03-2019T16:03:14,Combak,Cool!
16-03-2019T16:03:25,ThingsAreMoving,"How's your life been, Rima?"
16-03-2019T16:03:30,MuonNeutrino,"@Bgrmystr2 it's not the first, no, but it's still not *that* common"
16-03-2019T16:03:39,Bgrmystr2,common enough to expect it.
16-03-2019T16:03:50,BadFoMo,Autocomplete?
16-03-2019T16:04:08,Combak,"Yeah, type @ a username and hit Tab."
16-03-2019T16:04:14,Combak,Part of a username
16-03-2019T16:04:15,MuonNeutrino,"common enough that i'm not surprised about it after the fact, but not common enough that i was thinking about it in advance"
16-03-2019T16:04:16,Mippy,Autocucumber
16-03-2019T16:04:25,CrimsonQuill,Cucumbers taste nice.
16-03-2019T16:04:28,Bgrmystr2,I guess ya gotta think about it first haha
16-03-2019T16:04:36,MuonNeutrino,"yup, i can type @bgr and hit tab and it will autofill the rest of his name"
16-03-2019T16:04:46,Bgrmystr2,huh
16-03-2019T16:04:49,ThingsAreMoving,neat
16-03-2019T16:04:51,Bgrmystr2,I'd just click on my name myself.
16-03-2019T16:04:53,Mippy,Cucumber sandwiches are a nice summer treat
16-03-2019T16:04:57,ThingsAreMoving,wasn't aware of this function
16-03-2019T16:05:07,MuonNeutrino,"@Bgrmystr2 that starts a whisper, not what i wanted to do ^^"
16-03-2019T16:05:12,ShamusTheFox,So what's happening in this pic right now? Trace in his glory days with Nora by his side?
16-03-2019T16:05:18,Bgrmystr2,"yes, and you can change it to an @"
16-03-2019T16:05:22,CrimsonQuill,Hullo Shamus
16-03-2019T16:05:26,MarvTheHugPharaoh,@Bgrmystr2
16-03-2019T16:05:29,MuonNeutrino,yeah but that's more cumbersome
16-03-2019T16:05:34,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock: aaa
16-03-2019T16:05:34,CrimsonQuill,Trace is showing Nora his full potential.
16-03-2019T16:05:37,BadFoMo,...This is weird and interesting.
16-03-2019T16:05:37,Combak,"Nah, Trace first showing potential."
16-03-2019T16:05:38,Bgrmystr2,I disagree lol

16-03-2019T17:27:08,Combak,I like it... But next week
16-03-2019T17:27:16,ThingsAreMoving,Eric did nothing wrong!

16-03-2019T17:28:04,MuonNeutrino,"@ShamusTheFox well, last we saw of them they were going back to see if the tavern was still standing; given that maeve is in the chapter title page they'll likely be appearing, so we'll probably find out"
16-03-2019T17:28:05,BadFoMo,"No offence, but about the Baguette one; WHY?!"
16-03-2019T17:28:09,ShamusTheFox,Eric is trying to be a good guy.

16-03-2019T18:59:11,FenceEqualizer,Later Quill
16-03-2019T18:59:14,MuonNeutrino,it's BOTH keith and nat do a thing *and* kat and zen do a thing heh
16-03-2019T18:59:31,MarvTheHugPharaoh,A few hopes its not Floofy
16-03-2019T18:59:36,CanisRufusUK,"Four characters, that's quite a bit of work for a sketch"
16-03-2019T18:59:47,WereKeidran,"oops, missed poll due to LoL"
16-03-2019T18:59:48,ProsePro7,"The caption reads ""shouldnt have had taco bell"""
16-03-2019T18:59:51,MrMongMong,When the strawberry was better than what you expected.
16-03-2019T18:59:54,CatzArt,I wouldnt be suprised if we shipped everyone in the cast with each other at some point
16-03-2019T18:59:54,Mippy,Hmmm....Addie ref was close
16-03-2019T19:00:00,FloofyCat,"Marv, personally I'd ship Kat with someone other than Zen, always been kinda weird choice for shipping"
16-03-2019T19:00:03,unsteddyphoenix,Oh man some strawberry jam
16-03-2019T19:00:08,FloofyCat,Marv who would you have shipped Kat with? Eric?
16-03-2019T19:00:19,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Any one other then Zen
16-03-2019T19:00:21,ThingsAreMoving,Is this sequel to vampirella Rose?
16-03-2019T19:00:39,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I'm a Zen x Raine purist.
16-03-2019T19:00:56,unsteddyphoenix,Twist: the double date is NataniXKat and ZenXKeith
16-03-2019T19:01:06,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I would be ok with that
16-03-2019T19:01:11,FloofyCat,I'd prefer Zen x Raine and Kat to be open to someone new tbh
16-03-2019T19:01:11,thestooge2222,nah
16-03-2019T19:01:25,ThingsAreMoving,a love square!
16-03-2019T19:01:25,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Floofy, Welcome to the crew."
16-03-2019T19:01:35,BadFoMo,@unsteddyphoenix Nooo!

16-03-2019T19:01:43,ThingsAreMoving,o/ Were
16-03-2019T19:01:50,FloofyCat,"I think Kat definitely deserves someone after how long its been, although I think her and Zen haven't really had much contact"

16-03-2019T19:02:28,ThingsAreMoving,"Kat x Eric is acceptable for me, since that's basically what she wants"
16-03-2019T19:02:31,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I'm just a big fanboy of both Raine and Zen
16-03-2019T19:02:35,Zakuru,what is going on here? :eyes:
16-03-2019T19:02:36,unsteddyphoenix,"I just dont like how its pairing the ""leftovers"" that is Zen and Kat"
16-03-2019T19:02:58,unsteddyphoenix,"""Oh these characters dont have anyone right now? Just shove em together lol"""
16-03-2019T19:03:01,CatzArt,im trying to figure out who tom is drawing
16-03-2019T19:03:03,MuonNeutrino,is this the 'redrawing of trace transforming mary into a keidran'?
16-03-2019T19:03:05,ThingsAreMoving,"I'd say Karen is the biggest ""leftover"""
16-03-2019T19:03:10,Ordithus,"Natani, pretty sure"
16-03-2019T19:03:11,MarvTheHugPharaoh,That also urks me Teddy
16-03-2019T19:03:16,Mippy,I just want Kat to be happy.
16-03-2019T19:03:19,ThingsAreMoving,she doesn't have any ship afaik
16-03-2019T19:03:19,FloofyCat,^
16-03-2019T19:03:24,FloofyCat,She's too damn sweet
16-03-2019T19:03:28,unsteddyphoenix,Me too~ :ctwokinds-LauraCry:
16-03-2019T19:03:30,Ordithus,"Oooh, Muon, mayhaps"
16-03-2019T19:03:49,unsteddyphoenix,Well shes 16 and comic relief so
16-03-2019T19:03:57,ShamusTheFox,"I have been kinda ambivalent about Kat. Timewise, it hasn't been that long since Eric told her that he  considers her like a sister. Is she over Eric? Or does she want him to adapt his feelings for her?"
16-03-2019T19:04:05,ThingsAreMoving,Karen x Lynn ?
16-03-2019T19:04:09,MarvTheHugPharaoh,And also sage would kill anyone she was shipped with
16-03-2019T19:04:11,RimaDraws,nuh
16-03-2019T19:04:17,Ordithus,haha true Marv
16-03-2019T19:04:21,Mandag,"Karen x dragon statue, let's goooo"
16-03-2019T19:04:26,MuonNeutrino,@Ordithus it's the only one i can see from that list that seems like it'd fit the expressions
16-03-2019T19:04:27,CatzArt,Yeah I think Kat just wants to be considered family by Eric
16-03-2019T19:04:39,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Kat x Dragon statue.  I'm pushing that one
16-03-2019T19:04:40,Bgrmystr2,"lol marv, Sage has yet to realize that Karen is not real"
16-03-2019T19:04:45,Ordithus,You are right Muon
16-03-2019T19:04:47,CatzArt,Im in Marv
16-03-2019T19:04:48,Bgrmystr2,and can be shipped with anyone because of thus.
16-03-2019T19:04:51,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah hes so silly
16-03-2019T19:04:51,BadFoMo,@MuonNeutrino I think it is the NataniXKeith ZenXKathrin duble date.
16-03-2019T19:04:51,Mandag,I spy a templar insignia
16-03-2019T19:04:55,RimaDraws,thats mary!
16-03-2019T19:04:55,unsteddyphoenix,"Unlike Kat, who is real"
16-03-2019T19:04:59,ProsePro7,Oh!  Its the change
16-03-2019T19:05:02,Bgrmystr2,...clearly phoenix
16-03-2019T19:05:03,RimaDraws,its the trace and mary one
16-03-2019T19:05:14,Bgrmystr2,nicely pot'd btw
16-03-2019T19:05:14,BadFoMo,"Uh, nevermind, you were right."
16-03-2019T19:05:16,horoisawolf,good night
16-03-2019T19:05:19,Ordithus,"We just don't see Mary enough, hard to recognize her"
16-03-2019T19:05:20,ThingsAreMoving,"looks like it, Rima"
16-03-2019T19:05:26,ThingsAreMoving,o/ horo
16-03-2019T19:05:27,Ordithus,Night horo
16-03-2019T19:05:35,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nighty night Holo
16-03-2019T19:05:37,Sammit,Bye Horo
16-03-2019T19:05:45,CatzArt,Oh this is great. Night Horo.
16-03-2019T19:05:51,CrimsonHelsing,I can definitely see the transformation being bloody for being so painful originally
16-03-2019T19:05:54,CatzArt,But why is she bleeding?
16-03-2019T19:06:10,Zakuru,"unlike normal furry tansformations, this is painful"
16-03-2019T19:06:16,MuonNeutrino,she bit her tongue/lip with those unexpectedly sharp wolf teeth?
16-03-2019T19:06:25,Ordithus,And weird wolf mouth
16-03-2019T19:06:29,Mandag,Pretty sure they had a fight before the transformation
16-03-2019T19:06:33,CatzArt,I like Zakuru's answer better
16-03-2019T19:06:47,CrimsonHelsing,"oh right, it was implied she had taken a beating beforehand"
16-03-2019T19:06:54,Zakuru,ok i gotta brb now... gotta pack up to go back to school :sob:
16-03-2019T19:07:02,ThingsAreMoving,o/ Zak
16-03-2019T19:07:05,CatzArt,yeah I wouldnt want to fight memory intact Trace
16-03-2019T19:07:09,CatzArt,Bye Zak
16-03-2019T19:07:24,Sammit,Bye Zakuru
16-03-2019T19:07:34,ThingsAreMoving,It was implied that Mary was pretty strong magic user too
16-03-2019T19:07:48,MuonNeutrino,"heck, even a *demigod* didn't really enjoy that experience"
16-03-2019T19:07:48,unsteddyphoenix,"I mean, she was a grand templar"
16-03-2019T19:07:52,MuonNeutrino,"fighting trace, that is"
16-03-2019T19:07:54,Mandag,"Yeah, but I'm also pretty sure Trace was a completely new level of OP"
16-03-2019T19:07:56,Ordithus,For reference http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/51/
16-03-2019T19:08:14,unsteddyphoenix,"I wonder if she also had a ""unique ability"" like all the top mages seem to"
16-03-2019T19:08:16,RimaDraws,i was hoping this would get it at some point
16-03-2019T19:08:17,CatzArt,"The spell trace used was ""incomplete transformation"" right?"
16-03-2019T19:08:22,Mandag,"Like, the gods of the world had to descend and nerf him because he was just too unbalanced"
16-03-2019T19:08:42,MuonNeutrino,@CatzArt i think he called it 'imperfect transformation'
16-03-2019T19:08:50,MuonNeutrino,but something like that
16-03-2019T19:08:56,CrimsonHelsing,Trace again seems more and more like Anakin in terms of raw power
16-03-2019T19:09:26,Mandag,"His pre-amnesia arc is eerily similar to that of Darth Vader, yes."
16-03-2019T19:09:33,CatzArt,yeah but not as whiny
16-03-2019T19:09:41,Mandag,We don't know that
16-03-2019T19:09:42,CrRAR,Lol
16-03-2019T19:09:43,MuonNeutrino,lol
16-03-2019T19:09:48,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-nibsdance:
16-03-2019T19:09:50,MuonNeutrino,*nobody* was as whiny
16-03-2019T19:09:59,Mandag,"It's not been covered all that well in the comic, and is a bit mysterious"
16-03-2019T19:10:03,InTheLionsDen,:ctwokinds-nibsdance:
16-03-2019T19:10:03,ThingsAreMoving,"Unfteddy, It seems her superpower was telekinetically tossing books: http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/726/"
16-03-2019T19:10:07,CrimsonHelsing,far more redemable too
16-03-2019T19:10:32,CrimsonHelsing,unlike Anakin which only happened right at the bitter end
16-03-2019T19:10:49,unsteddyphoenix,Bookmage
16-03-2019T19:10:53,unsteddyphoenix,That must be it
16-03-2019T19:10:54,Ordithus,He at least has the excuse of being warped by black mana
16-03-2019T19:10:59,Mandag,Well he never redeemed himself. The only reason he's so nice now is because Neutral forcefully reset him against his own will.
16-03-2019T19:11:19,Ordithus,He did save Adira though!
16-03-2019T19:11:20,ThingsAreMoving,Arch librarian
16-03-2019T19:11:26,Mippy,Trace had a hard reboot
16-03-2019T19:11:38,unsteddyphoenix,hahhaa
16-03-2019T19:11:38,Mandag,That was modern day Trace
16-03-2019T19:11:58,CatzArt,Now we just need to cut of traces evil mana hand and we are good
16-03-2019T19:11:59,Lolcom,hi
16-03-2019T19:12:06,CatzArt,hello Lolcom
16-03-2019T19:12:07,CrRAR,Ello
16-03-2019T19:12:07,ThingsAreMoving,o/ lolcoim
16-03-2019T19:12:11,Ordithus,He's starting to redeem himself
16-03-2019T19:12:11,MrEase,"to be fair Mary was also not a good person, the templar still oversaw Keidran lynching while she was grand templar"
16-03-2019T19:12:31,Mandag,"Yeah, but Trace was worse"
16-03-2019T19:12:36,MrEase,don't forget that Rose was almost hung by the templar while Mary was in charge
16-03-2019T19:12:38,MrEase,yeah
16-03-2019T19:12:48,Ordithus,"That was when she was ""Headmistress"""
16-03-2019T19:12:50,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah Mary isnt exactly a saint
16-03-2019T19:12:53,MuonNeutrino,"well, to be fair, mary didn't have much to do with rose's almost-hanging"
16-03-2019T19:12:56,Ordithus,Of a singular Templar college
16-03-2019T19:13:01,MuonNeutrino,they had that set up before she even showed up on the scene
16-03-2019T19:13:02,unsteddyphoenix,It really bothers me that she judges Euchre in that scene
16-03-2019T19:13:02,RimaDraws,mary no she is such a ....well you know
16-03-2019T19:13:02,Mandag,"I bet the keidran were like ""finally, that Silverlock piece of scum is gone, now we can- OH FUCK GO BACK"""
16-03-2019T19:13:05,ThingsAreMoving,I think Trace is to good in his current state. He basically agrees to anything is being asked of him.
16-03-2019T19:13:14,ProsePro7,Tom did you take any story writing classes
16-03-2019T19:13:23,CatzArt,Trace is a little naive

16-03-2019T19:17:02,RimaDraws,i just think that no one likes her
16-03-2019T19:17:09,ThingsAreMoving,"Mother of a side character, not gonna get a lot of coverage"
16-03-2019T19:17:11,Ordithus,"Oh, yeah!  I remember that one, Marv"
16-03-2019T19:17:14,w0lfmare,"Oh yeah, he did"
16-03-2019T19:17:21,MuonNeutrino,i don't remember that one
16-03-2019T19:17:26,unsteddyphoenix,proof?
16-03-2019T19:17:29,Mippy,Nevre considerd doing Mary fanart...
16-03-2019T19:17:30,MuonNeutrino,or at least i dont think so
16-03-2019T19:17:36,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I'll snag it
16-03-2019T19:17:39,CatzArt,well if Mary popped up again and got a bit of character building she might be more popular
16-03-2019T19:17:51,ThingsAreMoving,She definitely would
16-03-2019T19:17:54,ProsePro7,Hey guys got a question.  I got writers block
16-03-2019T19:18:01,unsteddyphoenix,thats not a quesiton
16-03-2019T19:18:02,MuonNeutrino,the butler did it
16-03-2019T19:18:03,RimaDraws,yes?
16-03-2019T19:18:04,ThingsAreMoving,make a writers wall
16-03-2019T19:18:10,MuonNeutrino,"in the kitchen, with the candlestick"
16-03-2019T19:18:12,ProsePro7,What is a better opening for a tragic story
16-03-2019T19:18:21,ProsePro7,A girl with a loving family that she lost
16-03-2019T19:18:38,ProsePro7,or a girl with a crap family that teaches her that no one can be trusted
16-03-2019T19:18:44,RimaDraws,first one
16-03-2019T19:18:45,ShamusTheFox,What happened to her after Trace changed her? I dont fully remember.
16-03-2019T19:18:49,FloofyCat,"It'd be nice to see the really old characters again, but then I'd be scared that they'd want vengeance and kill some of the current ones or something."
16-03-2019T19:19:00,MviluUatusun,Who are we seeing here?  I was busy when this was voted on.
16-03-2019T19:19:02,Ordithus,"Trace sold her and Raine to slavery, they escaped with Euchre's help"
16-03-2019T19:19:07,ThingsAreMoving,first one would be more impactful if her story would become a tragic one during the process
16-03-2019T19:19:09,Ordithus,And went to Lyn'knoll
16-03-2019T19:19:13,Mippy,Neither....It's more tragic if you don't start the story tragically
16-03-2019T19:19:20,ShamusTheFox,"Ah, I see."
16-03-2019T19:19:24,MuonNeutrino,"@ShamusTheFox he sold her and raine into slavery, euchre then helped them escape. it's implied they lived in lynknoll for a while, before they reentered the story"
16-03-2019T19:19:37,Ordithus,"She reappeared in chapter 6 or so, during the whole Neutral thing"
16-03-2019T19:19:37,MuonNeutrino,"darnit, typed too slow heh"
16-03-2019T19:19:41,CatzArt,so we may see Mary in Lyn knoll?
16-03-2019T19:19:48,ProsePro7,Yeah I see where your coming from
16-03-2019T19:19:49,FloofyCat,"I can't remember the lynchings part, were the lynchings just at random or was it systematically finding and lynching Keidran?"
16-03-2019T19:19:51,Ordithus,"Not sure where she is, now"
16-03-2019T19:20:05,ProsePro7,Okay Ill keep as it is.  Thanks for the help
16-03-2019T19:20:10,CatzArt,not sure Floofy
16-03-2019T19:20:16,Ordithus,"That was the time when Rose was about to be killed, Floofy"
16-03-2019T19:20:23,ThingsAreMoving,They've been separated when they escaped. Mary's whereabouts are currently unknown
16-03-2019T19:20:32,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Infinite mary fanart incoming
16-03-2019T19:20:33,CanisRufusUK,"Raine said they were seperated shortly before she met up with the b team, so where she is now is uncertain"
16-03-2019T19:20:34,MarvTheHugPharaoh,https://www.deviantart.com/infinitedge2u/art/Keidran-Mary-Silverlock-722964897
16-03-2019T19:20:44,ProsePro7,I thought they were reunited at the end of the masks arc
16-03-2019T19:20:45,MuonNeutrino,"last time we saw mary in the present, iirc, was at the end of chapter 6"
16-03-2019T19:20:50,unsteddyphoenix,good boy marv
16-03-2019T19:20:54,Ordithus,Prose and Muon are right
16-03-2019T19:21:01,unsteddyphoenix,:star: <- for you
16-03-2019T19:21:03,MuonNeutrino,she doesn't appear to have gone back to pinewood with raine and the rest of group b

16-03-2019T19:21:17,ProsePro7,Plothole?
16-03-2019T19:21:23,Ordithus,Plot opening
16-03-2019T19:21:23,CatzArt,But who raised Raine again?
16-03-2019T19:21:29,RimaDraws,mary
16-03-2019T19:21:33,Ordithus,And a caretaker
16-03-2019T19:21:33,MuonNeutrino,"huh, i haven't seen that mary art, nice one"
16-03-2019T19:21:34,ProsePro7,And a maid
16-03-2019T19:21:35,ThingsAreMoving,Raine had a nanny
16-03-2019T19:21:45,Mippy,the tower raised Raine
16-03-2019T19:21:49,MuonNeutrino,"@CatzArt mostly a nanny/caretaker mary gave the job to, apparently"
16-03-2019T19:21:56,unsteddyphoenix,Books raised Raine
16-03-2019T19:21:57,Twokinds,Done
16-03-2019T19:22:03,RimaDraws,nice job tom
16-03-2019T19:22:06,ShamusTheFox,Are they still group a and group b? They're all together for the moment.
16-03-2019T19:22:07,Sammit,Very nice
16-03-2019T19:22:07,MuonNeutrino,"it seems that raine *knew* mary, so she couldn't have been completely absent, but she wasn't around much apparently"
16-03-2019T19:22:08,CatzArt,nice
16-03-2019T19:22:12,Ordithus,Nice!  Cool redraw of an old scene
16-03-2019T19:22:12,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Very well done Tom
16-03-2019T19:22:14,ProsePro7,Tom when you finish you should redo all of the old comic a remastered version
16-03-2019T19:22:15,ThingsAreMoving,Improvements / 10
16-03-2019T19:22:16,CrimsonHelsing,"Bravo, Tom!"
16-03-2019T19:22:16,unsteddyphoenix,"Nice JOb Tom, very dramatic"

16-03-2019T19:22:19,unsteddyphoenix,Big fan
16-03-2019T19:22:25,MuonNeutrino,drama/10
16-03-2019T19:22:26,CrimsonHelsing,very nice rework!
16-03-2019T19:22:29,EpicFangs,This Shaolin Warrior music sounds a lot like the main section of Shoutoku Legend ~ True Administrator.
16-03-2019T19:22:41,Ordithus,"Raine definitely knew Mary, she was still part of her childhood and they were together for a pretty long time"
16-03-2019T19:22:57,ProsePro7,Just distant and hands off
16-03-2019T19:23:04,MuonNeutrino,yup
16-03-2019T19:23:15,Ordithus,Between Trace's coup and meeting team b
16-03-2019T19:23:26,Bgrmystr2,"Yeah a lot of ppl think it was ripped, Epic"
16-03-2019T19:23:41,Twokinds,"""traditional wolf keidran double date"" so... just a double date"

16-03-2019T19:24:00,MarvTheHugPharaoh,only wolves
16-03-2019T19:24:01,ThingsAreMoving,but with 100% more awkwardness
16-03-2019T19:24:02,Bgrmystr2,Touhou music has a huge set of remixes but I highly doubt it was actually given any representation
16-03-2019T19:24:08,HeresyArtStream,No Adira this time. :<
16-03-2019T19:24:09,Bgrmystr2,so it feels like a rip
16-03-2019T19:24:11,EpicFangs,unsteddyphoenix has it right!
16-03-2019T19:24:22,Mippy,A double date with more AWOOOO!
16-03-2019T19:24:23,unsteddyphoenix,Pls make it Nat/Kat and Zen/Keith somehow

16-03-2019T19:25:39,ThingsAreMoving,sniff eachother's behinds and dig for bones or some stuff

16-03-2019T19:25:55,EpicFangs,UNSTEDDYPHOENIX HAS IT RIGHT
16-03-2019T19:26:06,BadFoMo,@unsteddyphoenix That's what I thought it would be.
16-03-2019T19:26:09,w0lfmare,Kat and keith trying to play the part where there is no part
16-03-2019T19:26:13,unsteddyphoenix,I always have it right~
16-03-2019T19:26:19,Bgrmystr2,so you say..
16-03-2019T19:26:29,unsteddyphoenix,Lol theyre like the tourists trying too hard to be locals?
16-03-2019T19:26:47,w0lfmare,Something like that
16-03-2019T19:26:49,ShamusTheFox,"If Keidran go on dates, do they put clothes on for the occasion?"
16-03-2019T19:26:53,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Sooo. like us trying to be gamers, teddy?"

16-03-2019T19:28:46,unsteddyphoenix,"Honestly neither of the brothers can cook, so probably for the best"
16-03-2019T19:28:51,Ordithus,Nat can cook
16-03-2019T19:29:07,ShamusTheFox,"Hell, in Trace's mansion, they could get whatever food they wanted, and live in luxury. Who needs to go out? Just stay in and party."
16-03-2019T19:29:13,unsteddyphoenix,They cant even assemble an ikea thing!
16-03-2019T19:29:16,unsteddyphoenix,I forget what it was

16-03-2019T19:29:55,ProsePro7,"I love this so, freakin, much"
16-03-2019T19:30:25,Ordithus,Natani is an epic chef https://www.patreon.com/posts/assassin-chef-20839628

16-03-2019T19:31:40,EpicFangs,good point Ordithus
16-03-2019T19:31:58,unsteddyphoenix,Only alternate ending is canon
16-03-2019T19:32:06,ShamusTheFox,"Welcome to Good Burger, home of the Good Burger, may I take your order?"
16-03-2019T19:32:11,Ordithus,That was the first part sketched

16-03-2019T19:34:23,Ordithus,"In another dimension, probably"

16-03-2019T19:35:12,Mippy,Kat don't wrap
16-03-2019T19:35:16,ThingsAreMoving,"lol, that would make this date very awkward, Shamus"

16-03-2019T20:33:26,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Things, they actually moved on from nitrous oxide"
16-03-2019T20:33:31,MuonNeutrino,"i have 2, but they weren't causing any issues so i didn't have them out"
16-03-2019T20:33:34,ThingsAreMoving,I have my top wisdom teeth. I had the bottom ones removed.

16-03-2019T20:34:23,ThingsAreMoving,Removing your wisdom teeth is more often than not the right choice to make
16-03-2019T20:34:30,microbuss,I think they numbed my mouth & II watched it all

16-03-2019T20:35:06,ThingsAreMoving,Removal of mine took ~10 minutes including the numbing shot

16-03-2019T20:36:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Much like Marks mine were feyucked
16-03-2019T20:36:43,microbuss,apparently the removal of tonsils was a mistake
16-03-2019T20:36:48,Ordithus,"in my case, it turned out the appendix was just fine"
16-03-2019T20:36:51,ProsePro7,Common sense is gone but didnt have much to start with
16-03-2019T20:36:52,ThingsAreMoving,tonsils have grown back after being removed like 25 years ago
16-03-2019T20:36:58,Mippy,I would have died though...so it was surgery or death
16-03-2019T20:37:00,Xexanoth,i go away for 5 minutes and everybody talking about what body parts they lost...the fuck...
16-03-2019T20:37:00,CatzArt,Good now just let the Basitain doctors remove your wisdom tooth with those bloody saws of theirs
16-03-2019T20:37:03,microbuss,I was born with 3 teeth!
16-03-2019T20:37:11,TheBeckoner,yeah everything but wisdom teeth

16-03-2019T20:37:44,Ordithus,"Kiwi no, just, no XD"
16-03-2019T20:37:45,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-maevecute:
16-03-2019T20:37:45,CatzArt,Actually question. Do you think basitains use anasthesia given that basitains have high pain tolerances already.
16-03-2019T20:37:45,microbuss,idk i hust had 3 teeth at birth
16-03-2019T20:37:52,RimaDraws,oh wow

16-03-2019T20:38:09,ThingsAreMoving,no kidding
16-03-2019T20:38:10,Xexanoth,The question would be if Basitins even have anasthesia
16-03-2019T20:38:19,CatzArt,i was born 3 months prematurly
16-03-2019T20:38:21,ThingsAreMoving,black hair and all
16-03-2019T20:38:22,Xexanoth,"since anasthesia is a pretty ""modern"" medicine thing"

16-03-2019T20:38:35,Mippy,Basitins just get smashed before a doctor visit

16-03-2019T20:38:44,Ordithus,Maddie is just jelly of Magpie's carefree attitude
16-03-2019T20:38:47,ThingsAreMoving,"Xex, opium was used as anaestesia more than 2000 years ago"
16-03-2019T20:38:48,BadFoMo,Fur?

16-03-2019T21:28:10,Dadrobit,"Thank you, I try sometimes."
16-03-2019T21:29:56,Dadrobit,"Funny story though. I'm working on commercials for the next post apocalyptic even my tribe is going to, and one of them is for advertising that we hired a fire dancer. The read is being done by one of our ladies, but she just can't seem to nail a good"
16-03-2019T21:30:06,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Man, I wish the secret round got drawn"
16-03-2019T21:30:28,Dadrobit,sultry tone like we wanted even after a good 25 minutes of recording.
16-03-2019T21:31:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Kitty has fallen asleep
16-03-2019T21:31:26,unsteddyphoenix,literally unable to be flirtacious? Rip
16-03-2019T21:31:30,Dadrobit,"So pops looks at me and says, ""Holdup Dadrobit, don't you drink hard liquor?"" ""Yeah, why?"" ""Gimme a second."""
16-03-2019T21:32:18,Dadrobit,"Pops goes out to my kitchen and pours us all some shots of whisky and comes back to the studio. ""Here, drink this lady and try it again!"""
16-03-2019T21:32:56,Dadrobit,She downs a shot like a champ and fucking nails the read on her second attempt. GG!!!
16-03-2019T21:34:09,Dadrobit,"'Course, I had to take my shot as well, but I already did my work for the day, so it was just a good time had by all once we got the read out of her."

16-03-2019T21:52:06,SpazztasticKiwi,2 days of anime binge
16-03-2019T21:52:44,SpazztasticKiwi,One of the best ideas I’ve had
16-03-2019T21:53:00,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: go on..
16-03-2019T21:53:28,Dadrobit,"Ohhhhhh, speaking of anime, if you wanna watch some cool fucked up shit, look up Love Death and Robots on Netflix. It's like a crossover between The Animatrix and old school Adult Swim!"
16-03-2019T21:54:10,Alphawolf333,I'm probably going to watch an episode before bed tonight actually
16-03-2019T21:55:07,Dadrobit,Have you started it? I'm about halfway through after a binge the other night.
16-03-2019T21:55:29,SpazztasticKiwi,"Ive been debating going through the entirety of all 7 seasons, 3 movies, and final act of the one I’m on now"
16-03-2019T21:55:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Again
16-03-2019T21:55:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe I’ll get to something else. Maybe
16-03-2019T21:56:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m just rewatching the final rn because when it came out I never actually sat and watched it. I just knew what happened and oh boy was there more to see
16-03-2019T21:56:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Everything got all wrapped up
16-03-2019T21:56:57,Bgrmystr2,of.. what series?
16-03-2019T21:57:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Inuyasha
16-03-2019T21:57:08,Bgrmystr2,lol ah
16-03-2019T21:57:09,FloofyCat,"Marv, secret round?"
16-03-2019T21:57:26,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s got to be my favorite
16-03-2019T21:57:31,MarvTheHugPharaoh,2017-11-27 on the poll results
16-03-2019T21:57:43,Bgrmystr2,so.. what was the idea you got from binging two days of anime?
16-03-2019T21:57:49,Bgrmystr2,you haven't said.
16-03-2019T21:57:51,Dadrobit,"Read that back in high school, never watched it."
16-03-2019T21:58:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Watched it for so long and now it’s over. But that also means I can rewatch and rewatch
16-03-2019T21:58:49,SpazztasticKiwi,I didn’t really get an idea. I am thinking of looking for a subjugation necklace for fashion
16-03-2019T21:59:29,Bgrmystr2,":ptv-wondering: ""One of the best ideas I've had"""
16-03-2019T21:59:38,Bgrmystr2,Looks like you had an idea to me.
16-03-2019T21:59:44,Bgrmystr2,guess you lost it between then and now? xD
16-03-2019T22:00:04,Dadrobit,"My failing memory makes me recall it as Dragonball Z, but with swords and bein more interesting in the relationships' plotlines."
16-03-2019T22:00:10,Dadrobit,being*
16-03-2019T22:00:21,Dadrobit,interested*
16-03-2019T22:00:50,Bgrmystr2,I remember it having decent opening and ending songs and the content of it was sub-par to par.'
16-03-2019T22:02:00,Bgrmystr2,All the girls in school in the club got super into it or whatever
16-03-2019T22:02:18,Bgrmystr2,"dunno, guess it just wasn't targeted towards me."
16-03-2019T22:03:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Only other anime’s I ever watched have kinda turned out to be flops
16-03-2019T22:03:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Deathnote got spoiled
16-03-2019T22:03:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Naruto crashed and burned to me
16-03-2019T22:03:54,Dadrobit,You need more Violet Evergarden in your life.
16-03-2019T22:04:31,SpazztasticKiwi,The biggest thing for me in Inuyasha was the brothers. They hated each other
16-03-2019T22:05:02,SpazztasticKiwi,"But when one helped the other in the final battle, everything is forgotten"
16-03-2019T22:05:25,SpazztasticKiwi,And suddenly they don’t mind each other’s existence
16-03-2019T22:06:37,TheOtherEric,Just flipped through the drawings in the stream i missed. Gotta day i give those last 2 an UWU and a half
16-03-2019T22:06:46,TheOtherEric,*say
16-03-2019T22:23:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh yeah and of course the biggest ship of the entire anime happens. That’s a thing too
16-03-2019T22:25:24,SpazztasticKiwi,"97 hours (not counting the movies) of tension later, God opens the heavens and says “let all the fan girls scream”"
16-03-2019T23:43:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Lots of IG stories boiling down to “shotsshotsshotsshots”
