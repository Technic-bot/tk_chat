29-05-2019T01:40:25,Dadrobit,Pro Tip: watching heart wrenching shows on the job is not a good idea. It's super hard to talk with clients face to face while I was just immediately prior ugly crying...

29-05-2019T11:36:01,AspiringNoodle,One thing that occurred to me recently.  Dragons are defined as beings of pure magic who only grow larger and stronger with age.
29-05-2019T11:36:29,AspiringNoodle,"Soooooooooooo, is there some kind of limit on age / growth?  Otherwise they could theoretically grow larger than the planet."
29-05-2019T11:47:43,TerraTheWizard,it'd take a very very long time
