23-10-2019T00:21:52,AspiringNoodle,Finally got around to playing Spec Ops: The Line
23-10-2019T00:21:54,AspiringNoodle,Like it so far
23-10-2019T01:49:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I had a young deer jump out in front of me once
23-10-2019T01:49:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Bambi’s a bit of an idiot

23-10-2019T09:37:28,AspiringNoodle,"Aw dang, that interview went nowhere :c"
23-10-2019T09:37:56,AspiringNoodle,Skill set is rather limited and there aren't really any entry level positions available
23-10-2019T09:38:11,AspiringNoodle,"And anything I might be able to do, they'd prefer professional experience"
23-10-2019T10:33:29,Orthonox,Spec Ops: The Line is a great game on a narrative level.

23-10-2019T12:40:45,AspiringNoodle,10/10 would visit
23-10-2019T12:43:28,AspiringNoodle,"Also, I'm finding the choices fascinating, considering that they are ultimately meaningless and just add little flavor adjustments to the story"
23-10-2019T12:44:05,AspiringNoodle,"That said, for my first 3 choices, I'm gonna go with civs, left, and then maaaaaaaaaybe burn :p"
23-10-2019T12:44:37,AspiringNoodle,"(I plan to replay on FUBAR, current difficulty is still a bit of a cake walk.  Only died while trying to do achieves)"
23-10-2019T12:52:22,TeapotOfDoom,Ahhh
23-10-2019T12:52:49,TeapotOfDoom,Stupid test. why can't it be over already

23-10-2019T22:05:58,AspiringNoodle,Now I can worry about getting my room back in order and my media consumption under control!
23-10-2019T22:06:34,AspiringNoodle,"And since open enrollment starts in a week, I can potentially find a reason to cut back further at work to work on other things :ptv-hearts:"
