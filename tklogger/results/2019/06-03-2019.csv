06-03-2019T00:05:57,Dadrobit,Pokemon on Switch might make me get one.
06-03-2019T00:06:27,TorqueEmUp,"There is plenty on the Switch to like, especially if you love Nintendo stuff."
06-03-2019T00:07:08,TorqueEmUp,"I grew up a Nintendo kid, so there is that. lol"
06-03-2019T00:08:03,Dadrobit,"Nah, I had friends with Nintendos early on, but my earliest gamin ventures were on a Sega Genesis, Macintosh, and eventually the PS1."
06-03-2019T00:08:43,Dadrobit,GameBoy was there though as well.
06-03-2019T00:09:08,Twokinds,I forget how to make an announcement
06-03-2019T00:09:21,Dadrobit,"Eventually my older step brother got an N64, but that was primarily a Goldeneye/Super Smash machine."
06-03-2019T00:09:28,Dadrobit,Hm?
06-03-2019T00:10:01,Dadrobit,Tom's pregnant y'all. Prepare for a 17 year term.
06-03-2019T00:10:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Pergenat
06-03-2019T00:10:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Why not announce hee
06-03-2019T00:10:59,SpazztasticKiwi,here
06-03-2019T00:11:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Or Twitter
06-03-2019T00:11:30,Twokinds,I just wanted to let everyone know the next comic page will be up on Saturday
06-03-2019T00:11:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Blast it everywhere
06-03-2019T00:12:23,SpazztasticKiwi,And by everywhere I mean here and Twitter. I don‚Äôt see you anywhere else
06-03-2019T00:12:26,Dadrobit,"Oh, right on then."
06-03-2019T00:13:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Unless you want to write it on the offline picture. Though I can still see people are gonna ask
06-03-2019T00:15:31,Dadrobit,"It really doesn't matter. Folks bitch about updates regardless, but they all get over it quick enough."
06-03-2019T00:15:37,SpazztasticKiwi,But ya. Cool. I was just spaced out scrolling over dress styles
06-03-2019T00:15:53,Twokinds,Well it was an unexpected break
06-03-2019T00:16:00,Twokinds,I didn't expect it to happen
06-03-2019T00:16:05,Twokinds,Though I did really need it
06-03-2019T00:16:37,SpazztasticKiwi,A break on comic pages?
06-03-2019T00:16:46,NibblyBot,New Comic Page: Next Page http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/1058/
06-03-2019T00:18:00,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt really follow that on your heels. I check whenever but I mainly use the you‚Äôll put it up when you put it up idea
06-03-2019T00:18:39,Dadrobit,"Was it an outside force that was the impetus, or did you just have a realization that was like, ""man, I could really use a break?"""
06-03-2019T00:19:25,Twokinds,It was a brick wall of writer's block
06-03-2019T00:19:53,SpazztasticKiwi,That Flora page. Like a high schooler seeing calculus for the first time
06-03-2019T00:20:01,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúUh. Wat‚Äù
06-03-2019T00:20:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Writers block: when your imaginary friends refuse to talk to you
06-03-2019T00:21:03,Dadrobit,So... A writer's brick then?
06-03-2019T00:22:40,Dadrobit,"Oh, wait, ""brick wall"". I only read the brick part and imaginged writer's block like being a figurative version of your imagination telling you to fuck off by throwing a brick through your window..."
06-03-2019T00:24:02,Bgrmystr2,so... a writer's brick. Yeah I think that about sums it up xD
06-03-2019T00:24:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Sleep with a dictionary under the pillow
06-03-2019T00:24:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Might help
06-03-2019T00:30:23,TorqueEmUp,Eat the dictionary to gain its power
06-03-2019T00:30:27,SpazztasticKiwi,I will eat some of this soup and then I‚Äôm off to bed
06-03-2019T00:30:49,TorqueEmUp,Though I am not sure how much a dictionary would help with writer's block anyway.
06-03-2019T00:30:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Just don‚Äôt take a bite of the urban dictionary
06-03-2019T00:31:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Might give you acid poisoning
06-03-2019T00:32:34,Bgrmystr2,or give you acid powers..
06-03-2019T00:32:41,Bgrmystr2,could be either or.
06-03-2019T00:32:47,Bgrmystr2,maybe both
06-03-2019T00:34:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I suddenly have a craving for butter biscuits with this soup
06-03-2019T00:40:36,Twokinds,Don't talk about food!
06-03-2019T00:40:40,Twokinds,I'm hungry but can't eat
06-03-2019T00:41:19,iliar,Diet?
06-03-2019T00:41:35,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúCan‚Äôt eat‚Äù
06-03-2019T00:41:37,Twokinds,yee
06-03-2019T00:41:41,SpazztasticKiwi,You got teeth don‚Äôt you
06-03-2019T00:42:00,SpazztasticKiwi,The starving diet isn‚Äôt the tp enjoyable
06-03-2019T00:43:02,SpazztasticKiwi,"Pacing yourself might work. Or if you‚Äôd prefer, i was gonna mention that ‚Äúbiscuit‚Äù was southern slang for some meaning something less likable"
06-03-2019T00:43:18,Twokinds,Need to maintain my girlish figure.
06-03-2019T00:43:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I am going to keep my damn mouth shut here for once
06-03-2019T00:47:24,SpazztasticKiwi,"But anyhoo, I‚Äôd suggest maybe a gym or something to help. You‚Äôve apparently been on a diet for at least a good year now"
06-03-2019T00:52:26,SpazztasticKiwi,"With that üç≤, I say ü•ò night night üçû to everyone here üåÆ"

06-03-2019T01:17:49,BadFoMo,@Dadrobit A little late but; Happy Belated Birthday to you Grandfather!
06-03-2019T01:19:42,Dadrobit,"Hahahaha, yeah, a bit late. Left their place a few hours ago."
06-03-2019T01:20:56,Dadrobit,Had a good time with him though. We spent an hour or so after dinner working in my father's new shop getting some shelves set up together.
06-03-2019T01:21:51,Dadrobit,"At 81, he's getting up there, but he still has a lot of drive left in him."
06-03-2019T01:27:12,Dadrobit,"Heading to bed myself though. Have a good night y'all! And thanks for the comic update update, Tom. Hopefully your block is satiated after getting your ""me-time"" in! :D"

06-03-2019T16:13:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Probably the reason
06-03-2019T16:14:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Mark could probably swing for some dumplings though. He‚Äôs reported that he‚Äôs sick. Again. Shocker I know
06-03-2019T16:14:55,ThingsAreMoving,"Lots of people being sick recently, for some reason. :ctwokinds-floraquestion:"

06-03-2019T18:04:38,Dadrobit,"I grew up with a Jewish family though, so I personally prefer matzoh ball soup which are basically just dumplings made with a matzoh base."
06-03-2019T18:05:05,Dadrobit,Just brings me back to big family gatherings with grandma's cooking.
06-03-2019T18:06:31,TerraTheWizard,can anyone here help me find the pic of keith over someone's shoulder
06-03-2019T18:10:37,Dadrobit,There's the one of Keith's spirit over Natani's shoulder after a body swap?
06-03-2019T18:11:24,TerraTheWizard,"no, i mean being carried"
06-03-2019T18:12:40,TerraTheWizard,i thought i imagined it

06-03-2019T18:21:12,TerraTheWizard,we're pretty sure
06-03-2019T18:21:24,ThingsAreMoving,"What did you think was wrong with you though, bgr?"
06-03-2019T18:21:27,Bgrmystr2,I have one where Keith is carrying Natani over his shoulders and having a tough time with it.
06-03-2019T18:21:50,Bgrmystr2,"I went in cuz my right foot was swelling, but the doc didn't think it was anything out of the ordinary.. or something"
06-03-2019T18:22:08,Bgrmystr2,I also recall there was Natani carrying keith over her shoulders as well
06-03-2019T18:22:19,Bgrmystr2,but I don't know where that one is
06-03-2019T18:22:44,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I know there are two or three like that. But the only one with Keith being carried that I'm aware of in recent history was that of Natani kind of cradling Keith in a Comic Con sketch."
06-03-2019T18:22:47,Bgrmystr2,"the former one I saw recently, but I went through several thousands of pictures the other day"
