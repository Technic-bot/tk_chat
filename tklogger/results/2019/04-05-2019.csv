04-05-2019T13:00:22,CrimsonQuill,Especially steam ones.
04-05-2019T13:00:46,CrimsonQuill,I think that Mippy might have been more concerned about the quality of the ride however.
04-05-2019T13:00:58,IronHorseComics,Then you'll be happy to know the news about Big Boy 4014 being back in steam

04-05-2019T13:10:01,CrimsonQuill,Ummm....I might be a bit hesitant about that one.

04-05-2019T13:13:46,IronHorseComics,"aw man you should have been there, it was hilarious"
04-05-2019T13:14:24,IronHorseComics,"I take it a step further and have her wearing a Blues Brothers outfit and going in squirrel ""I'm on a mission from God"""

04-05-2019T13:49:08,CrimsonQuill,I thought so.
04-05-2019T13:49:21,CrimsonQuill,She's one of my all time favourite Harry Potter characters.

04-05-2019T14:27:43,SpazztasticKiwi,If we want to split hairs. Especially since the most recent skits
04-05-2019T14:28:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Which brings up what I came across on tumblr last night. Anyone know why it‚Äôs a theory that Mark is in Texas to rob a museum? Where did the fandom get that?

04-05-2019T15:08:37,Mandag,Well then
04-05-2019T15:08:38,BadFoMo,I'm hoping that you only need to be a patreon user.
04-05-2019T15:08:47,Bgrmystr2,"That's not the case, Fomo"
04-05-2019T15:08:53,TeapotOfDoom,Nope. already tried that
04-05-2019T15:08:57,Dimensional,"I hope I'm still able to vote. I'm stuck using a VPN, and the previous few times of voting I wasn't able to due to VPN detection on the site"
04-05-2019T15:08:59,Bgrmystr2,because I'm a Patreon user and I'm not allowed to vote.
04-05-2019T15:09:11,amenon,"@Dimensional at least this time, that won't be a problem"

04-05-2019T15:10:04,Bgrmystr2,there's threads on specific websites where people talked about rigging the poll.

04-05-2019T15:10:18,Mandag,What specific websites?
04-05-2019T15:10:28,Bgrmystr2,the one we do not speak of.
04-05-2019T15:10:35,amenon,It's not based on anything anyone said anywhere. It's based on me looking at the data.
04-05-2019T15:10:37,Mandag,Oh. That's very informative.
04-05-2019T15:10:44,TeapotOfDoom,@amenon I guess you tried using something like recapcha3? Did that not solve the problem? Asking cus interested

04-05-2019T15:19:45,BonPansky,im hoping the new system means more cool story based sketches rather than fanservice

04-05-2019T15:20:16,Mandag,"But again, I would like to see the data presented. This seems like a very drastic measure without showing proof to the public."
04-05-2019T15:20:16,Dimensional,Yeah. Cuts down on Ballot Stuffing
04-05-2019T15:20:16,SageSaga,Mihari found a talent for Jedi knight that is just dumb- like dumb awesome but still- dumb
04-05-2019T15:20:17,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Sage
04-05-2019T15:20:18,Twokinds,The new voting system just checks if you are a patron.

04-05-2019T15:20:37,ReeseWolf,the new voting system doesnt work at all
04-05-2019T15:20:40,Bgrmystr2,So.. literally ONLY people who can pay can vote.

04-05-2019T15:21:31,Bgrmystr2,apparently not
04-05-2019T15:21:31,IronHorseComics,almost missed the poll
04-05-2019T15:21:32,CrimsonQuill,"Sadly by the looks of it, no"
04-05-2019T15:21:33,Dimensional,"Correct, Reese"
04-05-2019T15:21:33,TeapotOfDoom,Seems like it

04-05-2019T15:21:50,Mandag,Doesn't seem so. The alleged rigging ruined it apparently.
04-05-2019T15:21:52,Sclimshady,Salamanstra
04-05-2019T15:21:52,9000Kitsune,wasnt the sugestions supposed to be for the ten dollar teir?
04-05-2019T15:21:52,Dadrobit,"I mean, you just have to be a Patron yeah? Not a certain level of Patron? So a buck a month would suffice."
04-05-2019T15:21:53,Bgrmystr2,you have to pay patreon
04-05-2019T15:21:59,ReeseWolf,well have a good day then
04-05-2019T15:22:02,Bgrmystr2,to support tom to be allowed to vote
04-05-2019T15:22:04,BonPansky,"this hopefully means less ""Boobies and random sexy ships! and more ""What happpened to these characters before the story!"" and things like that"
04-05-2019T15:22:07,BowlOfSomething,"Well, that's shite"
04-05-2019T15:22:10,CrimsonQuill,@SclimShady see the new chapter cover in that#? Kessah looks confused.

04-05-2019T15:22:43,BowlOfSomething,I guess I'll just go to sleep
04-05-2019T15:22:44,CrimsonQuill,"@BonPansky I like the ""before the story"" as it adds context, but I agree on less of the lewd stuff"
04-05-2019T15:22:44,IronHorseComics,@BonPansky Me too

04-05-2019T15:23:16,GiantBurger,"@BonPansky I would like that, but I'm not really that against things like that"

04-05-2019T15:23:31,Menke,Well hopefully mine is one of the ones you have a hard time deciding on. XD
04-05-2019T15:23:34,Dadrobit,Marv gets it
04-05-2019T15:23:39,MviluUatusun,"Oh, well.  I guess it'll be a while before I can vote.  But, at least I can still see the end result."
04-05-2019T15:23:40,Dadrobit,\o/
04-05-2019T15:23:40,CrRAR,haha
04-05-2019T15:23:41,FenceEqualizer,Wonder if the type of suggestion wins will actually be affected.

04-05-2019T15:24:13,ReeseWolf,this new change pretty much killed all my enthusiasm
04-05-2019T15:24:19,Mandag,"Yeah, same"
04-05-2019T15:24:28,BonPansky,"i mean, surely yall are still here to see the sketches be made"

04-05-2019T15:25:22,SamuelLeumas,Do I hear a kirby in the background of this song? Or is that just a coincidence?
04-05-2019T15:25:23,ReeseWolf,pretty much
04-05-2019T15:25:28,Bgrmystr2,"but yes, here for the sketches primarily."
04-05-2019T15:25:36,BowlOfSomething,I can't believe some dipshits rigged the system
04-05-2019T15:25:39,CrRAR,Yeah Kirby or a Pikachu

04-05-2019T15:26:02,TeapotOfDoom,calm down people they have to protect themselves from spammers. would ruin the fun even more
04-05-2019T15:26:02,megamario1392,That new system puts me off too.

04-05-2019T15:26:50,BadFoMo,The Greatest Showman?
04-05-2019T15:26:50,Combak,IDK which ones though. XD

04-05-2019T15:27:05,CrRAR,Hugh Jackman movie FoMo
04-05-2019T15:27:10,CrRAR,about a circus
04-05-2019T15:27:13,FenceEqualizer,Litterally had someone say they went to 4chan to get a large group of people to vote for his art at one point
04-05-2019T15:27:14,CrRAR,or something
04-05-2019T15:27:18,TeapotOfDoom,amenon said there was proof in the data. so i guess obvious spam voting from some ip adresses or something like that
04-05-2019T15:27:25,BadFoMo,"No, I ment this one."
04-05-2019T15:27:30,SageSaga,giving people proof of something like that calls out the people doing it and some people don't like putting targets on people
04-05-2019T15:27:30,BonPansky,if yall wanna vote
04-05-2019T15:27:34,BonPansky,become a patreon
04-05-2019T15:27:36,BonPansky,simple as
04-05-2019T15:27:36,BowlOfSomething,At least tom will earn more now
04-05-2019T15:27:54,Mandag,I have been in pretty much every single of the 4chan threads. Only once was there ever the slightest sign of mass rigging.
04-05-2019T15:28:04,ProsePro7,Looks like the start of a rave
04-05-2019T15:28:23,SageSaga,nice anecdote
04-05-2019T15:28:27,CrRAR,Be kind; vote blind.
04-05-2019T15:28:36,Bgrmystr2,"Not how it works, Bon. Not everyone can afford it."
04-05-2019T15:28:42,Sclimshady,But I can see CrRAR
04-05-2019T15:28:42,Bgrmystr2,"ANd that's besides the point, so way to miss it"
04-05-2019T15:28:46,CuTeWoLf,Hi
04-05-2019T15:28:47,BonPansky,and if you cant afford it
04-05-2019T15:28:48,BonPansky,you cant vote

04-05-2019T16:16:23,iliar,"However, I looked through the ballots. Usually people vote for different options. There is no such thing that all the options coincided in several ballots. But in the last polls many identical ballots began to appear."

04-05-2019T16:18:13,SageSaga,you cant trust same IPs because people who do that use Proxys

04-05-2019T16:18:35,CrRAR,lol Nibbly with a video camera and production gear giving a thumbs-up is amusing imagery.

04-05-2019T16:19:23,TeapotOfDoom,i wonder if these people were manipulating the votes manually or by using bots

04-05-2019T16:19:32,Xexanoth,"sure 2 might happen, but 3 is already very suspicious anything above that is pretty much guaranteed to be someone cheating"

04-05-2019T16:20:22,BadFoMo,@iliar I don't know what that means. Why is that a problem?
04-05-2019T16:21:04,iliar,"@BadFoMo Yes, Nibs makes streaming recordings. But the chat module and the stream module are independent modules. Chat module is not required to record streams."

04-05-2019T16:24:24,Xexanoth,which has nothing to do with people not having money....
04-05-2019T16:24:33,TeapotOfDoom,The new design of the Klingons is debatable but you get used to it
04-05-2019T16:24:39,Rubbermatt,"this is not extermination, this is pest control"
04-05-2019T16:24:41,CrimsonQuill,@vevans0009 What about aliens in Halo or Doctor Who?
04-05-2019T16:24:45,Bgrmystr2,"Of course not, Sage.'"

04-05-2019T16:31:46,vevans0009,Saria was what kept Trace sane.
04-05-2019T16:31:59,vevans0009,Then ALL hell broke loose.
04-05-2019T16:32:04,AFallingTree,How does the new poll work?

04-05-2019T16:32:41,Snowdayzz,Yo
04-05-2019T16:32:47,CrimsonQuill,But from The Last of Us and Red vs Blue.

04-05-2019T18:11:33,GiantBurger,"gotta cover the booty, still at risk of showing bits"
04-05-2019T18:11:34,Bgrmystr2,"and making Addy wear a loincloth, @Serja"
04-05-2019T18:11:39,Elosan,"Speaking of loin clothes for tails, do you think it is just a hold she puts her tail through? or maybe there is a little button clip that goes over the tail?"
04-05-2019T18:12:00,CrRAR,*watches intently*
04-05-2019T18:12:04,PalmettoPathfinder1,I wonder if Tom loses more fans this way.
04-05-2019T18:12:07,unsteddyphoenix,buttons are future tech
04-05-2019T18:12:15,vevans0009,:ptv-kippi2:
04-05-2019T18:12:18,Serja,I could think of a few ways it could be worked around the tail tbh.
04-05-2019T18:12:27,vevans0009,I am questioning my loyalty.
04-05-2019T18:12:30,MuonNeutrino,why on earth would he lose fans for that
04-05-2019T18:12:40,unsteddyphoenix,adelaide so srong that the cloth just moves out of her tails way
04-05-2019T18:12:44,MuonNeutrino,there are plenty of places on the internet ot see butts if that's what yo uwant
04-05-2019T18:12:44,Serja,"I mean, if people are just here for the lewd they can go plenty of other places for that?"
04-05-2019T18:12:45,PalmettoPathfinder1,He preys on our emotions.
04-05-2019T18:12:51,vevans0009,x3
04-05-2019T18:13:04,FenceEqualizer,Like the loincloth gives her that amazonian feel.
04-05-2019T18:13:12,Serja,Yeah
04-05-2019T18:13:12,PalmettoPathfinder1,Although Tom could be extremely sadistic and turn off comments.
04-05-2019T18:13:19,Elosan,"hmm...so maybe it is a piece of string that is tied over the tail then?  however, tieing a string behind you back would be a little difficult."
04-05-2019T18:13:20,vevans0009,All right......at least we have chesticles.
04-05-2019T18:13:21,Serja,Indeed he could
04-05-2019T18:13:26,vevans0009,:ptv-unimpressed:
04-05-2019T18:13:35,Elosan,Ugh  these questions plague my mind!
04-05-2019T18:13:38,PalmettoPathfinder1,Oh dear.  I think I gave him ideas.  Terrible ideas.
04-05-2019T18:13:50,Serja,"Well, it could also be a split cloth in the back with a reinforced spot where the tail fits between?"
04-05-2019T18:14:00,BadFoMo,Looks like the button; but how would bother with putting a button like that on a loin cloth?
04-05-2019T18:14:01,PalmettoPathfinder1,@Serja good point.
04-05-2019T18:14:17,Mippy,Back with foods
04-05-2019T18:14:20,GiantBurger,looks more like it was jsut a hole to me
04-05-2019T18:14:22,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Although some loincloths cover the front and not the back, but it does depend on the style of loincloth."
04-05-2019T18:14:23,Serja,Would give greater freedom of movement and account for the tail while still being modest I think
04-05-2019T18:14:25,vevans0009,Want dat tail to break that stupid cloth.
04-05-2019T18:14:26,Sclimshady,Butt is back

04-05-2019T18:16:45,drazgon,"Hmmm... What kind of clothes is this... em.. thing? Is this some ceremonial for some ritual? When King wears like west wild basitins? Is this the most ""canon"" clothes for King?))"
04-05-2019T18:16:48,Bgrmystr2,I like the lack of loincloth :)
04-05-2019T18:16:58,vevans0009,^^
04-05-2019T18:17:05,unsteddyphoenix,doesnt the base of the tail hve to be covered though?
04-05-2019T18:17:06,Elosan,I think the loincloth is coming back.  I am interested in the design of  it.
04-05-2019T18:17:11,MuonNeutrino,@drazgon i would assume it's the basitin idea of underwear
04-05-2019T18:17:13,vevans0009,"Hush, you!"
04-05-2019T18:17:13,unsteddyphoenix,that was a l e w d a r e a i think
04-05-2019T18:17:19,MuonNeutrino,"yep, it was"
04-05-2019T18:17:24,Serja,I approve of the cloth. But it can be helpful to know what's underneath for drawing it accurately
04-05-2019T18:17:32,Aphala,We genuinely need more Adelaide art
04-05-2019T18:17:40,Bgrmystr2,"of course that's the point of reference sheets, Serja."
04-05-2019T18:17:45,Elosan,That is what I was thinking Serja
04-05-2019T18:17:53,vevans0009,For....personal studies.
04-05-2019T18:17:55,GiantBurger,"@Serja shockingly, its a booty"
04-05-2019T18:18:12,PalmettoPathfinder1,"When Tom said ""Getting Internet? Wait how are you even here!?"" I actually laughed so hard my sides hurt.  And then y'all freaked out!"
04-05-2019T18:18:15,unsteddyphoenix,yeah that would work tom
04-05-2019T18:18:16,vevans0009,Flexed butt
04-05-2019T18:18:19,Serja,I'm still new to art so I tend to draw at least the full silhouette of the body before laying down details over the top like clothing
04-05-2019T18:18:24,Serja,'cause practice

04-05-2019T18:27:05,Bgrmystr2,"hmmmmm, looks okay to me"
04-05-2019T18:27:15,Mippy,So full of foods
04-05-2019T18:27:41,vevans0009,Sad how Maddie tries to compare to her mother.
04-05-2019T18:27:49,Elosan,"I guess I was just thinking her lower half seems to be a little too large compared to her upper half.  However, that is probably just me."
04-05-2019T18:28:09,TerraTheWizard,:peach:
04-05-2019T18:28:15,Bgrmystr2,"her legs maybe.. hmm, yeah I can sorta see that"
04-05-2019T18:28:17,vevans0009,Maddie.......honey.  You have special attributes.
04-05-2019T18:28:19,Bgrmystr2,but she's REALLY really tall
04-05-2019T18:28:25,Bgrmystr2,so hard to say
04-05-2019T18:28:26,PalmettoPathfinder1,You know I wonder why Adelaide is so much stronger and taller than other Basitins.
04-05-2019T18:28:30,unsteddyphoenix,Shes never skipped leg day in her LIFE
04-05-2019T18:28:37,Bgrmystr2,every day is leg day
04-05-2019T18:28:37,PalmettoPathfinder1,I have several things (all probably nowhere near being right).
04-05-2019T18:28:44,Xexanoth,"i mean, it's other people comparing Maddie to her Mother"
04-05-2019T18:28:49,ProsePro7,Those are some small thighs for that build.  Tom give her some squats!
04-05-2019T18:29:03,PalmettoPathfinder1,Theory 1: She's a dragon in disguise or was cursed to be a Basitin.
04-05-2019T18:29:04,Serja,Maybe she's just wiry?
04-05-2019T18:29:04,TerraTheWizard,"anime logic, her parents were both short for basitin"
04-05-2019T18:29:05,InTheLionsDen,She isn't big. The others are just small.
04-05-2019T18:29:11,vevans0009,Hate seeing cute girls cry.
04-05-2019T18:29:16,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-LauraCry:
04-05-2019T18:29:19,PalmettoPathfinder1,Theory 2: She's actually a Mask in disguise.
04-05-2019T18:29:20,TerraTheWizard,so she had to be really big to balance it out/ comedy
04-05-2019T18:29:27,MuonNeutrino,"yeah, if anything is a bit small it's her thighs, i was expecting a bit more muscular"
04-05-2019T18:29:31,vevans0009,x>
04-05-2019T18:29:33,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Theory 3: Tom just likes really tall, strong women."
04-05-2019T18:29:43,vevans0009,Hmmm perhaps.
04-05-2019T18:29:43,ProsePro7,Nice arse though
04-05-2019T18:29:55,TerraTheWizard,lol prose

04-05-2019T18:30:15,unsteddyphoenix,That you see in swole people
04-05-2019T18:30:18,Xexanoth,"Theory 4: She just has Gigantism, which is a thing that exists in nearly all species"
04-05-2019T18:30:31,PalmettoPathfinder1,Dang it!  That was my next theory!
04-05-2019T18:30:31,Aphala,"Or, she's just a bamf"
04-05-2019T18:30:36,Aphala,lets be real
04-05-2019T18:30:47,PalmettoPathfinder1,But I'm happy that someone else thought of the same thing too.
04-05-2019T18:30:58,ProsePro7,Theory 5: Shes a Kaiju
04-05-2019T18:31:02,unsteddyphoenix,That thing that tom said?
04-05-2019T18:31:04,PalmettoPathfinder1,Gives Xexanoth a digital Oreo pie.
04-05-2019T18:31:05,Xexanoth,more like a BAMILF :ptv-laugh:
04-05-2019T18:31:06,unsteddyphoenix,Pretty good thewoory yeah
04-05-2019T18:31:10,Twokinds,Not bad for someone over 50

04-05-2019T18:31:26,GiantBurger,"damn, she takes care of herself"
04-05-2019T18:31:26,Aphala,Too close

04-05-2019T18:31:37,vevans0009,OMFG
04-05-2019T18:31:41,BadFoMo,"""Make it 50""?"
04-05-2019T18:31:42,GiantBurger,I'm still down for it tho
04-05-2019T18:31:44,Xexanoth,"why you booing, you know i'm right :P"
04-05-2019T18:31:51,Elosan,I wonder what the base tail bandage is for...
04-05-2019T18:31:52,Aphala,You are
04-05-2019T18:31:52,ProsePro7,Tom you gotta stop dropping these bombs
04-05-2019T18:31:55,Aphala,hehe
04-05-2019T18:31:58,vevans0009,She is immortal! x3
04-05-2019T18:32:04,CrimsonHelsing,well there are plenty of people these days that age quite well for how old they actually are
04-05-2019T18:32:04,Aphala,Will we ever find out about her husband ?
04-05-2019T18:32:06,unsteddyphoenix,drop boobs not bombs?
04-05-2019T18:32:09,TerraTheWizard,to hide the lewdest part of the tail ofc
04-05-2019T18:32:09,SomeDudeNamedQ,"Wow, Adelaide has such amazing musculature!"
04-05-2019T18:32:12,Sclimshady,Long live the king
04-05-2019T18:32:22,Xexanoth,Adelaide has an amazing everything
04-05-2019T18:32:23,vevans0009,Basitans are scary....
04-05-2019T18:32:24,CrRAR,"Adelaide: ""These guns DON'T tarnish~"""
04-05-2019T18:32:25,SomeDudeNamedQ,I can imagine how strong those glutes must be
04-05-2019T18:32:27,Mippy,Alabaster was absolutely immortal if he was already an adult when she was a kid
04-05-2019T18:32:32,NathanINS,This is taking a while...
04-05-2019T18:32:47,Elosan,She likes snu snu ;-)
04-05-2019T18:32:53,CrRAR,King's worth it~
04-05-2019T18:32:59,Xexanoth,Can't rush perfection
04-05-2019T18:33:01,vevans0009,"Tom, I would hug you."
04-05-2019T18:33:01,ProsePro7,So what are bastians like saiyans or something
04-05-2019T18:33:02,PalmettoPathfinder1,It makes me wonder if Adelaide was picked on and bullied due to her Gigantism.
04-05-2019T18:33:09,Bgrmystr2,lol no
04-05-2019T18:33:12,ProsePro7,Short and they dont age
04-05-2019T18:33:13,Aphala,lol she probably crushed them
04-05-2019T18:33:14,MuonNeutrino,bullying adelaide strikes me as a .... risky proposition >.>
04-05-2019T18:33:20,Sclimshady,She would not stand for that
04-05-2019T18:33:23,Bgrmystr2,because they see strength is superior
04-05-2019T18:33:23,CrRAR,what aphala
04-05-2019T18:33:24,Aphala,literally
04-05-2019T18:33:25,CrRAR,said
04-05-2019T18:33:26,Xexanoth,generally you don't bully people that can easily crush you
04-05-2019T18:33:26,InTheLionsDen,They might do it once.
04-05-2019T18:33:34,CrimsonHelsing,more like Albion was finally having his age catch up to him
04-05-2019T18:33:36,Bgrmystr2,"she wouldn't be picked on at all, she'd be viewed as a god, or something"
04-05-2019T18:33:38,unsteddyphoenix,Also the basitins all admire strength
04-05-2019T18:33:41,Elosan,Wondering if there will be a version with the back loincloth.  I am curious what the finish product will look like!
04-05-2019T18:33:43,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah what bgr said
04-05-2019T18:33:44,vevans0009,She is freaking 50 yet still looks fine as a moth....
04-05-2019T18:34:02,MuonNeutrino,being highly physically fit and active really does keep you young
04-05-2019T18:34:04,Sclimshady,Are you into moths?
04-05-2019T18:34:06,ProsePro7,Details later
04-05-2019T18:34:08,Bgrmystr2,even the TEXT for her name is massive.
04-05-2019T18:34:09,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Even if that wasn't true, she would probably have a hard time at life: doorways would be short, bumping into tree branches and doorways."
04-05-2019T18:34:18,Bgrmystr2,everything about her is huge
04-05-2019T18:34:27,DarthKeidran,What‚Äôs going on with the voting system. I just got woken up and there was a comment saying that the voting is suddenly patron only.
04-05-2019T18:34:34,NathanINS,"Also, if adelaid is the king that would make her husband..."
04-05-2019T18:34:39,MuonNeutrino,people kept comitting vote fraud
04-05-2019T18:34:44,vevans0009,A queen?
04-05-2019T18:34:47,vevans0009,hehe
04-05-2019T18:34:49,Bgrmystr2,"maybe, palm, but you'd think they'd just change it for her. xD"
04-05-2019T18:34:54,Twokinds,Done
04-05-2019T18:34:56,ProsePro7,Hey Darth welcome to a new voting world
04-05-2019T18:34:57,Elosan,"From what I heard DarthKeirdan, there was voting fruad occuring."

04-05-2019T18:35:19,Sclimshady,Stronk/10
04-05-2019T18:35:22,MuonNeutrino,@vevans0009 i believe the title would be prince consort
04-05-2019T18:35:26,GiantBurger,50 years of godliness
04-05-2019T18:35:26,BadFoMo,Nice.
04-05-2019T18:35:27,MuonNeutrino,at least in human monarchies
04-05-2019T18:35:29,PalmettoPathfinder1,"They probably did, but not without a few grumbling.  Still, once she became king, there would be very little to no grumbling."
04-05-2019T18:35:30,CrRAR,A hallmark of Basitin TOUGHNESS.
04-05-2019T18:35:32,IronHorseComics,did I miss round 3 of voting?
04-05-2019T18:35:37,unsteddyphoenix,"Nah, I dont think he'd have any title at all"
04-05-2019T18:35:41,ProsePro7,So that means she was 33 when she had Maddie
04-05-2019T18:35:44,Elosan,You can vote if you are a patron (does not matter how much you pay) if I recall correctly.
04-05-2019T18:35:44,PalmettoPathfinder1,But yeah Muon you're right.  It would be prince-consort.
04-05-2019T18:35:46,unsteddyphoenix,"Well, not from her at least"
04-05-2019T18:35:51,MuonNeutrino,"@unsteddyphoenix probably, yeah"
04-05-2019T18:35:57,unsteddyphoenix,We know he was a master general before alaric though
04-05-2019T18:36:01,vevans0009,Her parents must be dieties.
04-05-2019T18:36:02,MuonNeutrino,it doest seem to fit how basitins do things
04-05-2019T18:36:02,DarthKeidran,"I‚Äôm guessing Adelaide Ref Sheet? How is that working out, or is it almost voting time."
04-05-2019T18:36:05,unsteddyphoenix,"Nice work tom, btw"
04-05-2019T18:36:10,ProsePro7,There is hope for you yet mature single ladies
04-05-2019T18:36:12,DarthKeidran,How is the voting I meant.
04-05-2019T18:36:21,ProsePro7,Sign into patreon
04-05-2019T18:36:24,MuonNeutrino,next should be a tom pick
04-05-2019T18:36:26,BadFoMo,Top pick is next?
04-05-2019T18:36:34,CrRAR,yus
04-05-2019T18:36:35,SamuelLeumas,"Voting requires logging in with patreon, then it'"
04-05-2019T18:36:39,SamuelLeumas,it's the same as before
04-05-2019T18:36:48,Bgrmystr2,"if you're not a patron, you can't vote."
04-05-2019T18:36:59,NathanINS,Wish we would get a crossover suggestion
04-05-2019T18:37:01,Andromedian1,"I've tried the Patreon login, yet it says unverified user"
04-05-2019T18:37:03,SamuelLeumas,"Patreon is just a verification wall, to prove you're unique"
04-05-2019T18:37:04,unsteddyphoenix,Huh. Interesting. I wonder if we'll see some changes
04-05-2019T18:37:04,Aphala,"Tom needs to do a detailed artbook of all the Keidran / Basitin cultures, and how they work. :P"
04-05-2019T18:37:08,Aphala,I'd pay top dollar for that
04-05-2019T18:37:09,vevans0009,Wonder what Tom will choose.
04-05-2019T18:37:12,NathanINS,If possible
04-05-2019T18:37:14,Bgrmystr2,no it isn't Samuel.
04-05-2019T18:37:14,PalmettoPathfinder1,Same here.
04-05-2019T18:37:16,Andromedian1,"I suppose I'd have to be a patron of Tom, yes?"
04-05-2019T18:37:19,Xexanoth,hmm the only problem with the new voting system is that it will probably lead to less Maeve/Maddi art :(
04-05-2019T18:37:20,SamuelLeumas,"Oh, my bad"
04-05-2019T18:37:30,Serja,"Yeah, have to be a Patron of Tom's and he has to manually put it in I believe?"
04-05-2019T18:37:30,DarthKeidran,Im getting this up on my computer. The app never works and The comments are flying by too fast.
04-05-2019T18:37:33,ProsePro7,If it says unverified it means you need to confirm it in your email...I think
04-05-2019T18:37:34,vevans0009,8o
04-05-2019T18:37:44,Bgrmystr2,you have to be a confirmed patron of tom to viote. and yeah tom's putting them in manually
04-05-2019T18:37:47,PalmettoPathfinder1,NathanINS I will do a crossover suggestion soon. Don't worry.  I'm not going to tell you what it is though.  :)
04-05-2019T18:38:05,Serja,Didn't we get a crossover with that colored piece last week?
04-05-2019T18:38:07,BadFoMo,What will it be?
04-05-2019T18:38:12,ProsePro7,Next
04-05-2019T18:38:20,Bgrmystr2,"yeah I think prose is right, unverified is probably a patreon thing"
04-05-2019T18:38:34,PalmettoPathfinder1,Can't tell you in public but I'll pm you though.
04-05-2019T18:38:36,vevans0009,I'm scared.....
04-05-2019T18:38:44,BadFoMo,Hmm?
04-05-2019T18:38:53,vevans0009,Of the unknown.. x3
04-05-2019T18:38:57,Storyteller3010,what going on
04-05-2019T18:39:09,FenceEqualizer,Wait since Tom enters it manually does that mean he manually inputted nearly 2000 patreons o_O Dedication.
04-05-2019T18:39:16,TerraTheWizard,it's an eye!
04-05-2019T18:39:16,DarthKeidran,so what has tom sketched so far?
04-05-2019T18:39:17,vevans0009,Looks like a eye.

04-05-2019T18:39:28,CrRAR,Probably exported an inital list I would hope

04-05-2019T18:39:37,Elosan,So this is Tom's pick correct?
04-05-2019T18:39:39,MuonNeutrino,"@DarthKeidran Keith and Natani doing acrobatics, sad Rose reacting to news of Saria's death, and then the ref sheet"

04-05-2019T18:40:32,DarthKeidran,@MuonNeutrino Was the K&N Acrobatics Tom's pick or vote?
04-05-2019T18:40:33,MuonNeutrino,*mourning

04-05-2019T20:59:04,Dadrobit,"""information about your connection will be recorded to look for anomalies. The data will not be shared with anyone"" Don't hold out on specific data. You're not getting it."
04-05-2019T20:59:29,GiantBurger,@Mippy you're the one whos been suggesting that one?
04-05-2019T20:59:49,Mippy,Yup @GiantBurger
04-05-2019T21:00:02,BadFoMo,"@Combak That's, one way. But I was thinking more along the lines of a withe list for non-Patreons."
04-05-2019T21:00:04,MuonNeutrino,"normally round 1 of voting will show a spread of votes, more for some than others ofc but a steady progression from least to most. when there's suddenly one sketch that has twice as many votes in round one as everything else, it's pretty suspicious"

04-05-2019T21:01:00,Combak,"FoMo, that'd be favoritism. Also, that would be a PITA to implment."

04-05-2019T21:01:46,Ordithus,Gets in the head and all
04-05-2019T21:01:52,BadFoMo,@Combak How would it be favoritism?
04-05-2019T21:02:59,DarthKeidran,Sorry @Ordithus. It's just meant to be an idea for what one might look like if if he didn't have one thought up already.
04-05-2019T21:03:08,Bgrmystr2,it would only be favoritism if it was only used for specific members of the community instead of everyone at large. whitelist would help tracking down the rigging
04-05-2019T21:03:47,RandomTonio,I thought that it would be a really popular choice if the margin was that large
04-05-2019T21:03:52,funnyman42,Making it Patron excpusive is also just a simpler solution.
04-05-2019T21:04:26,Bgrmystr2,it would also be bad mojo for the community at large lol
04-05-2019T21:04:41,Bgrmystr2,and contrary to the purpose of everything being public and open for everyone to enjoy and participate

04-05-2019T21:52:48,FloofyCat,Oh man it's going to be something sad isn't it
04-05-2019T21:53:06,funnyman42,"Anywho, bye guys!"

04-05-2019T21:53:27,Kyledoor,goodnight.
04-05-2019T21:53:35,Sclimshady,Stop killing things
04-05-2019T21:53:48,unsteddyphoenix,I worry more about the fact that she FELL OFF A DRAGON
04-05-2019T21:54:01,GiantBurger,"And you know, hat a tower explode around her"
04-05-2019T21:54:01,FenceEqualizer,It's okay she landed on Trace butt first.

04-05-2019T21:54:18,Ordithus,The ZAP one was inspired
04-05-2019T21:54:24,Dadrobit,giggity?
04-05-2019T21:54:34,Sclimshady,Phrasing?
04-05-2019T21:54:39,FloofyCat,"""Thank you for nothing, you useless reptile."""
04-05-2019T21:54:47,BadFoMo,I found the video I was talking about.
04-05-2019T21:54:48,Bgrmystr2,"inspired, or inspiring, Ord?"

04-05-2019T21:54:53,Bgrmystr2,cuz I'd consider both
04-05-2019T21:55:05,Ordithus,moreso the former
04-05-2019T21:55:06,SamuelLeumas,"Damn, missed the additional sketches, fell asleep half way through"
04-05-2019T21:55:10,Ordithus,Been a victim too many times
04-05-2019T21:55:20,Ordithus,Almost wrecked my pc with static before
04-05-2019T21:55:52,BadFoMo,I'm think I'll take a nap now.
04-05-2019T21:55:56,FloofyCat,"Also I finished university, so soon I'll be getting a job so I'll be able to sub on Patreon and make suggestions \o/"
04-05-2019T21:55:59,BadFoMo,*thinking.
04-05-2019T21:56:16,BadFoMo,Can't brain right now.
04-05-2019T21:56:36,GiantBurger,@BadFoMo ooh thats on the older side. no wonder i never heard of it
04-05-2019T21:56:43,GiantBurger,ain't that old
04-05-2019T21:57:04,FloofyCat,I wonder what to suggest...
04-05-2019T21:57:23,Dadrobit,:( I might be getting a job soon as well.
04-05-2019T21:57:34,GiantBurger,sucks having to wait to suggest new stuff after getting picked. I have so many ideas
04-05-2019T21:57:36,amenon,"Aww, damn"
04-05-2019T21:57:39,FloofyCat,Is that good or bad?
04-05-2019T21:57:43,RimaDraws,hi amenon!
04-05-2019T21:57:48,FloofyCat,There's a cooldown if you get picked?
04-05-2019T21:57:54,FloofyCat,Is it like one pick a month or something?
04-05-2019T21:57:55,amenon,Heyo Rima
04-05-2019T21:57:57,FenceEqualizer,Wait is that bad Robit?
04-05-2019T21:57:58,RimaDraws,^^
04-05-2019T21:58:10,Dadrobit,"Yeah, called up my old post to ask them what they'd think of me coming back, ""When can you start?"""
04-05-2019T21:58:26,GiantBurger,@FloofyCat I was told that he wont put up suggestions for a while if you got picked
04-05-2019T21:58:38,FloofyCat,"Darn, just a while?"
04-05-2019T21:58:41,GiantBurger,"so i wait, like a month"
04-05-2019T21:58:44,MuonNeutrino,i thought it was a week
04-05-2019T21:58:48,MuonNeutrino,but i dunno

04-05-2019T21:58:59,FloofyCat,I'll ask Tom next stream.
04-05-2019T21:59:02,Dadrobit,"It's kinda sub-optimal. I'm currently working from home as a voice actor. Taking a real job would give me better stability, but it'd stunt my VO work."
04-05-2019T21:59:20,FloofyCat,"And if I see you again remind me if I don't remember and I'll tell you, unless you ask and find out first."
04-05-2019T21:59:30,Dadrobit,And trying to go to college without stability is fucking haarrrrd.
04-05-2019T21:59:51,GiantBurger,@FloofyCat will do i can make it to a stream before next sunday and you're there
04-05-2019T21:59:53,amenon,The solution is obvious
04-05-2019T22:00:00,amenon,Work as a voice actor from your job
04-05-2019T22:00:02,GiantBurger,if i can*
04-05-2019T22:00:34,Dadrobit,And the post promised extra bonuses/inentives and a bodycam this time.
04-05-2019T22:00:42,GiantBurger,"well if anyone is still around, cya later"
04-05-2019T22:00:57,Dadrobit,o/ Giant

04-05-2019T22:01:59,Sclimshady,What kind of post uses bodycams?
04-05-2019T22:01:59,qwe304,"@Twokinds if you ever liked a youtube video, you technically have a channel"
04-05-2019T22:02:07,Dadrobit,HOA

04-05-2019T22:02:21,unsteddyphoenix,So
04-05-2019T22:02:30,unsteddyphoenix,He probably hasnt liked anything
04-05-2019T22:02:44,Sclimshady,"Oh, like the guys at the gates?"
04-05-2019T22:02:49,BadFoMo,"@GiantBurger @FloofyCat If your thing wins, you're on 'cool down' the next Sunday. You can make requests the following Sunday."
04-05-2019T22:03:13,Dadrobit,"Yeah, the site I used to work was suuuper upper crust. My guard house was bigger than my own first house."
04-05-2019T22:03:14,FloofyCat,^ Thanks :p

04-05-2019T22:04:32,Dadrobit,Would have to cut my hair as well to go back though.
04-05-2019T22:04:39,Dadrobit,RIP ponytail
04-05-2019T22:04:54,FloofyCat,Why would you have to cut it?
04-05-2019T22:05:11,FenceEqualizer,Professionalism probably
04-05-2019T22:05:13,Dadrobit,Long hair on men is considered unprofessional
04-05-2019T22:05:16,Sclimshady,Standard of grooming

04-05-2019T22:05:19,FenceEqualizer,Got to meet dress code for that sort of job
04-05-2019T22:13:11,Dadrobit,"Yeah, the rule for that place was while glove service and platinum rule."
04-05-2019T22:13:16,Dadrobit,white glove*
04-05-2019T22:14:40,Dadrobit,Access control folks were more like general servants than true security.
04-05-2019T22:15:07,Dadrobit,Serving tea/coffee and making conversation was most of the job.
04-05-2019T22:17:38,amenon,I didn't realize you were in Ouran
04-05-2019T22:17:59,Dadrobit,"No, Scottsdale."
04-05-2019T22:18:05,amenon,Ahaha
04-05-2019T22:22:28,Dadrobit,"But hey, look on the bright side, if I got a job, I'd have more time to read your fics!"
04-05-2019T22:23:09,amenon,Slacker :p
04-05-2019T22:24:05,Dadrobit,Well it's either you or Frank Herbert on the slow nights.

04-05-2019T22:32:58,amenon,I'm not sure where I want to go with this gag. Something about you only having read one book or something.
04-05-2019T22:33:28,Dadrobit,"Okay, I lied kinda? I also watched the movie when I was younger."
04-05-2019T22:34:21,amenon,They should make a David Lynch's Dune: The Movie: The Book
04-05-2019T22:34:45,amenon,Keep adapting it back and forth and see how long until it makes sense
04-05-2019T22:36:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Kinda ‚Äúmet‚Äù my friends roommates new bf
