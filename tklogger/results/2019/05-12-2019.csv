05-12-2019T23:52:18,Dadrobit,I'm actually pretty furious about it tbh.
05-12-2019T23:52:52,Dadrobit,Built my little brother an computer with Cyber Monday and he already has his up and running.
05-12-2019T23:52:57,Dadrobit,A*
05-12-2019T23:53:28,Dadrobit,I ordered my case two full weeks ago and they manage this fuckup.
05-12-2019T23:53:38,Titanarisium,oh no
05-12-2019T23:53:52,Titanarisium,What kind of case was it
05-12-2019T23:54:14,Dadrobit,Be quiet!
05-12-2019T23:54:23,Titanarisium,okay
05-12-2019T23:54:28,AspiringNoodle,I somehow have managed to use coolermaster both times :ptv-uneasy:
05-12-2019T23:54:41,AspiringNoodle,But can you blame me for the 2nd case? :ptv-whiny:
05-12-2019T23:56:41,Dadrobit,"I feel like there may have been a misunderstanding lol. be quiet! is a name brand, I wasn't telling you to shut up."
05-12-2019T23:56:49,AspiringNoodle,^
05-12-2019T23:56:53,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
05-12-2019T23:56:55,unsteddyphoenix,Lmao
05-12-2019T23:56:56,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
05-12-2019T23:57:05,AspiringNoodle,Their whole schtick is super quiet cases
05-12-2019T23:57:20,AspiringNoodle,Them and phanteks
05-12-2019T23:57:26,Ordithus,"Mine is NZXT, it's one of their quite models... from 2011"
05-12-2019T23:57:37,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Same Ord, mines a S340"
05-12-2019T23:57:50,AspiringNoodle,CoolerMaster H500M
05-12-2019T23:57:54,AspiringNoodle,This case is stupidly quiet
05-12-2019T23:58:12,Ordithus,Discrete and quite.  I am not for flashy cases
05-12-2019T23:58:17,Ordithus,*quiet
05-12-2019T23:58:21,AspiringNoodle,I have to put my head right next to the dual 200mm fans in order to hear a low-pitch hum
05-12-2019T23:58:27,Ordithus,Nice
05-12-2019T23:58:31,SageSaga,Be Quiet! is a pretty good brand
05-12-2019T23:58:48,AspiringNoodle,I still need to install RGB control software
05-12-2019T23:58:57,AspiringNoodle,"Got the good ol' rainbow vomit running, lol"
05-12-2019T23:58:58,Dadrobit,Gamers Nexus did a review on the case I'm getting and found it was quieter than a case with literally no fans. That sold me on it.
05-12-2019T23:59:47,SageSaga,my case is pretty sweet- it also has 2 giant 200mm RGB fans on the front
05-12-2019T23:59:54,AspiringNoodle,H500M? :D:D:D
