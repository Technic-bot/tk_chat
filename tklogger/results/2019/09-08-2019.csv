09-08-2019T00:03:06,Ordithus,You've spent all your luck
09-08-2019T00:03:35,SageSaga,luck is not good or bad so if you have a lot of it then things can go just as bad as they go well
09-08-2019T00:04:08,RimaDraws,wait there was a raffle
09-08-2019T00:04:10,LannAF,O_o
09-08-2019T00:04:30,LannAF,but things don't really usually go catastrophically wrong for me
09-08-2019T00:04:33,sunblaze,so less luck and higher chance of something happening sage?
09-08-2019T00:04:35,LannAF,and I'm fairly lucky
09-08-2019T00:04:39,LannAF,Just not as lucky as Tom
09-08-2019T00:04:40,RimaDraws,im not
09-08-2019T00:04:44,LupinKurt,darn did i miss the stream?
09-08-2019T00:04:56,LannAF,oh wait nvm that's if it'd have to be one extreme or the other
09-08-2019T00:05:11,Mippy,@LupinKurt No
09-08-2019T00:05:22,Sclimshady,"Im going to bed,  i apparently have to be a tourist in a town i go to like every other month"

09-08-2019T00:05:39,Ordithus,"@LupinKurt Tom lost power, Sage is streaming though!"
09-08-2019T00:05:41,RimaDraws,he had a power outage
09-08-2019T00:05:59,Mippy,@LupinKurt Do...do you not see stream?
09-08-2019T00:06:15,LupinKurt,i dont see stream no
09-08-2019T00:06:18,Mippy,Tom’s power died?!
09-08-2019T00:06:31,unsteddyphoenix,it was murdered
09-08-2019T00:06:50,Mippy,:ctwokinds-zenshocked:
09-08-2019T00:06:52,LupinKurt,is he planing on coming back when its back up?
09-08-2019T00:07:06,unsteddyphoenix,Thats up to the gods
09-08-2019T00:07:13,InTheLionsDen,That will probably depend on when he gets power back.
09-08-2019T00:07:15,SageSaga,"""I think you mean suicide"" ""Oh no, it was murder, his power hated itself"" ""uhhh"""
09-08-2019T00:07:24,RimaDraws,lol
09-08-2019T00:07:29,Mippy,Oh look! A Nyna
09-08-2019T00:07:32,HeresyArtStream,"""Tom's stream didn't just die. It was murdered."""

09-08-2019T00:08:27,InTheLionsDen,Turned the transformer 5 degrees. It didn't like it.
09-08-2019T00:08:57,FloofyCat,I challenge everyone to a sleeping contest
09-08-2019T00:09:13,SageSaga,i was using a quote from a movie called Murder By Death
09-08-2019T00:09:29,Mippy,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
09-08-2019T00:09:31,InTheLionsDen,A great movie.
09-08-2019T00:09:55,Mippy,Never heard of it but sounds like a blast
09-08-2019T00:10:03,InTheLionsDen,It was very silly.
09-08-2019T00:11:23,Mippy,"Well, I’ve made my appearance for the night. I’ve got to sleep and try to get better for tomorrow. I’ve got to work."

09-08-2019T00:15:13,Dadrobit,Work calmed down a bit. Getting to chill out for now. Got a Monster just in case I get real tired.
09-08-2019T00:15:22,unsteddyphoenix,smart smart
09-08-2019T00:15:50,sunblaze,damn Nyna looks even better then I imagined in that dress :ptv-excited:
09-08-2019T00:16:20,ZRO4825,"I see Monster, my brain autocompletes it with Hunter. I blame Sage for this."
09-08-2019T00:16:27,Dadrobit,Would be mildly hypocritical to fall asleep when I've fired others on the spot for the same >.>
09-08-2019T00:16:47,MarvTheHugPharaoh,sleep with your eyes open
09-08-2019T00:16:51,MarvTheHugPharaoh,like gandalf

09-08-2019T00:19:02,Dadrobit,Up there with Dave asking HAL to open the pod Bay doors.
09-08-2019T00:20:34,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I can't do that dave
09-08-2019T00:25:28,Dadrobit,"Not gonna lie, I have it available on my phone right now. It might be a 2001 watching night at work tonight"
09-08-2019T00:25:44,Dadrobit,S'been probably a year since I saw it last.
09-08-2019T00:27:01,sunblaze,thats some unexpected detailed work!

09-08-2019T00:28:04,AnuSekaniArt,Evening all!
09-08-2019T00:28:09,Dadrobit,Got to see it as a special event at the theatre a year ago where they re-released it on true reels that they busted out the original negatives to create. It was a friggin experience!
09-08-2019T00:28:18,Dadrobit,o/ anu
09-08-2019T00:28:29,AnuSekaniArt,Saw the Egyptian Nyna in the preview thumbnail. Highly approve <3

09-08-2019T00:29:32,AnuSekaniArt,So did I miss much?
09-08-2019T00:29:41,SageSaga,i wanted to make sure i got it done now so i didnt lose the reference image XD
09-08-2019T00:30:18,sunblaze,it was jsut a pic for a rough idea. and you made it 100% better
09-08-2019T00:30:22,sunblaze,so no complains
09-08-2019T00:32:38,SageSaga,oof... i gotta do a painting for this comic

09-08-2019T00:35:02,ZRO4825,"Make it a painting of Nyna's butt, alongside Tali's butt. BAM. Fanservice, AND serving a purpose!"
09-08-2019T00:35:05,SageSaga,yeah im doing alright- im hungry but i dont have anything I can cook tonight XD - only food i have is for Lunch and dinner tomorrow
09-08-2019T00:35:18,SageSaga,Zro
09-08-2019T00:35:23,SageSaga,that makes no sense
09-08-2019T00:35:48,AnuSekaniArt,Oof XD
09-08-2019T00:35:57,Dadrobit,"""Ban him"" -Patreon probably"
09-08-2019T00:36:23,ZRO4825,It makes perfect sense in a booty focused mindset!
09-08-2019T00:36:24,sunblaze,unlewdifies ZRO4825
09-08-2019T00:36:28,sunblaze,take that!
09-08-2019T00:36:32,ZRO4825,"Sir, I'm an un-unlewdable."
09-08-2019T00:37:02,ZRO4825,I am the bane of Patreons everywhere.
09-08-2019T00:37:12,sunblaze,weill I can at east believe that :P
09-08-2019T00:37:19,sunblaze,least
09-08-2019T00:37:23,SageSaga,it took everything Zro had to find a tasteful swimsuit for me to draw Toyoko in
09-08-2019T00:37:35,AnuSekaniArt,:P
09-08-2019T00:37:46,ZRO4825,He's not wrong.
09-08-2019T00:38:10,sunblaze,hmmm toyoko. at least good choice!
09-08-2019T00:38:33,ZRO4825,"I try so hard to make things safe. But alas, my loose morals are so much different from the common prude society. ;_;"
09-08-2019T00:38:57,ZRO4825,"Tis discrimination against the pervy, it is! D:<"
09-08-2019T00:39:32,sunblaze,yeah yesterday google censored a 200 page webcomic that had a nakid catgirl sitting on a bed
09-08-2019T00:39:34,sunblaze,on page 8
09-08-2019T00:39:42,sunblaze,took them long enough :D
09-08-2019T00:39:43,ZRO4825,:thinking:
09-08-2019T00:40:40,Dadrobit,I am very mildly curious?
09-08-2019T00:41:30,Dadrobit,"Also, #BingIt"
09-08-2019T00:41:31,SageSaga,im curious how google censors someones comic
09-08-2019T00:41:38,sunblaze,may I link another webcomic?
09-08-2019T00:41:52,sunblaze,they probably reported it to someone that did it
09-08-2019T00:42:24,unsteddyphoenix,"as long as its not page 8, I guess"
09-08-2019T00:42:24,SageSaga,yeah you can link it
09-08-2019T00:42:45,Dadrobit,Removes their SEO utilization somehow I suppose???
09-08-2019T00:42:56,sunblaze,http://cat-nine.net/
09-08-2019T00:43:17,Dadrobit,Web page not available
09-08-2019T00:43:39,unsteddyphoenix,"It loaded for me, took a while though"
09-08-2019T00:43:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,took forever to load for me
09-08-2019T00:44:08,unsteddyphoenix,just gotta...make it to page 8...
09-08-2019T00:44:16,sunblaze,its a US-based server
09-08-2019T00:44:31,sunblaze,might be slow for some :ptv-condescending:
09-08-2019T00:44:55,AnuSekaniArt,"Anywho, best get to bed"
09-08-2019T00:44:57,AnuSekaniArt,Night guys!
09-08-2019T00:45:03,AnuSekaniArt,Keep up the great work Sage! :D
09-08-2019T00:45:04,MarvTheHugPharaoh,nighty night anu
09-08-2019T00:45:13,SageSaga,take care Anu
09-08-2019T00:45:18,sunblaze,bye
09-08-2019T00:45:28,SageSaga,im in the US and its super slow
09-08-2019T00:45:39,sunblaze,I am aware of that
09-08-2019T00:45:45,unsteddyphoenix,What! theres no nekkid on page 8!
09-08-2019T00:45:52,unsteddyphoenix,I have been thoroughly hornswaggled
09-08-2019T00:46:37,ZRO4825,Pretty sure he said he was linking a different comic.
09-08-2019T00:46:48,unsteddyphoenix,I am furious
09-08-2019T00:46:53,sunblaze,nah let me check
09-08-2019T00:47:03,sunblaze,probably jsut bad brain-memory
09-08-2019T00:48:12,sunblaze,it was 15
09-08-2019T00:48:13,sunblaze,my bad
09-08-2019T00:48:21,sunblaze,for not doubllechekcing it
09-08-2019T00:48:32,unsteddyphoenix,Back to the lewdgrinds for me
09-08-2019T00:48:54,Bgrmystr2,"just go to the archive button at the top left, phoenix"
09-08-2019T00:49:00,Bgrmystr2,it's easier
09-08-2019T00:49:20,Bgrmystr2,"for me, the page loads super slow, but it loads nonetheless"
09-08-2019T00:50:10,Dadrobit,"Yeah, just flat out doesn't work on the Picarto app. And it was super slow on the browser. Just flat out stopped working after a bit. Had to open the archive in a new tab because it wasn't registering my requests for anything."
09-08-2019T00:50:21,unsteddyphoenix,We made it. Nice.
09-08-2019T00:50:42,sunblaze,yeah wierd it was not that slow last time I chekced it
09-08-2019T00:50:50,Dadrobit,Top/side-bewbs achieved.
09-08-2019T00:50:55,sunblaze,I'll ask the artist later about it
09-08-2019T00:51:50,Bgrmystr2,I'm... going to put this comic into my list of things to read. :thinking:
09-08-2019T00:52:10,sunblaze,I figure its a rather big list?
09-08-2019T00:52:43,Dadrobit,"Hard ""maybe"" from me. Not a huge fan of the style."
09-08-2019T00:52:49,Bgrmystr2,":ptv-shock: w-what! Nnnnnnno? There's only a few hundred titles in there, nothing too big...."
09-08-2019T00:53:03,Bgrmystr2,":ptv-confused: totally normal, let's go with that yes"
09-08-2019T00:53:34,sunblaze,fair enough dadrobit
09-08-2019T00:53:59,sunblaze,I have several comics as well that were very promising ins tory. but I could just not get used to the style
09-08-2019T00:54:04,Bgrmystr2,it gives me hella nostalgia for 80s and 90s anime
09-08-2019T00:54:11,Bgrmystr2,the style is reminicient
09-08-2019T00:54:20,Dadrobit,"Also, the unresponsive site is a bit of a deal killer."
09-08-2019T00:55:01,Dadrobit,I can see that bgr. Was getting tenchi muyo vibes from page 8 with the cat.
09-08-2019T00:55:01,Bgrmystr2,"it only takes a second or two more than other sites I use, so it's not a dealbreaker for me thankfully"
09-08-2019T00:55:33,Bgrmystr2,but those sites load entire chapters of comics.. this is just one strip
09-08-2019T00:55:36,Bgrmystr2,so it's pretty bad
09-08-2019T00:55:42,Dadrobit,"It's straight up not loading new pages when I click on the navigation bar or comic. Have to go to the archive, and open everything in New tabs"
09-08-2019T00:55:58,Bgrmystr2,oh wow that's terrible
09-08-2019T00:56:54,SageSaga,do ya think its fair to say i have one of the largest longest running webcomics there is?
09-08-2019T00:57:39,sunblaze,I think kevin % kell has that throne
09-08-2019T00:57:45,sunblaze,but you are not far away yes
09-08-2019T00:59:24,Bgrmystr2,"Freefall started when, 1996?"
09-08-2019T00:59:36,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah id say so
09-08-2019T00:59:52,Dadrobit,"You're up there, but I can think of a few that are super long running as well. Erfworld, OOTS, xkcd"
09-08-2019T00:59:52,Bgrmystr2,"the symbol you're looking for is &, Sun"
09-08-2019T00:59:56,Bgrmystr2,% is percent
09-08-2019T01:00:06,SageSaga,im not saying the biggest- just like maybe top 30?
09-08-2019T01:00:10,Dadrobit,QC's been around for a long time.
09-08-2019T01:00:46,sunblaze,ok acording to the artist the server is on the phillipines and only gets reroutet to the US: and its currently Typhoon season that might affect the speed :(
09-08-2019T01:00:58,Dadrobit,There are probably a few that are super unknown as well that just upload their stuff to the void.
09-08-2019T01:00:58,AspiringNoodle,I'm back :D
09-08-2019T01:01:11,AspiringNoodle,Body treated that more like a nap than a night's sleep -3-
09-08-2019T01:01:54,Dadrobit,"I was gonna say Dr McNinja, but I think that finally concluded recently ish."
09-08-2019T01:02:41,AspiringNoodle,Webcomics are evil!
09-08-2019T01:02:51,SageSaga,dude...
09-08-2019T01:02:51,sunblaze,true
09-08-2019T01:02:54,AspiringNoodle,They trick you with the free entry
09-08-2019T01:02:54,sunblaze,but sin is good!
09-08-2019T01:02:59,SageSaga,wat
09-08-2019T01:03:16,AspiringNoodle,"Then they make you fall in love with them and their characters so much, and then you end up spending all your money on merch"
09-08-2019T01:03:19,Dadrobit,"World Dream Bank, but that's not ~exactly~ a webcomic..."
09-08-2019T01:03:26,AspiringNoodle,And you spend way more than you would with regular comics :P
09-08-2019T01:04:01,sunblaze,not to mention you litereally kill time becuase ah jsut 1 more page of that 900 page webcomic
09-08-2019T01:04:12,AspiringNoodle,I knooooow!
09-08-2019T01:04:14,sunblaze,at 5:50 am and you need to be at 6 at work :D
09-08-2019T01:05:37,Dadrobit,"Just do what I do and get a low maintenance job that's 99% killing time and 1% ""oh fuck this is an emergency."""
09-08-2019T01:06:04,sunblaze,I literally have that
09-08-2019T01:06:17,sunblaze,but I use thse 99% to plan new D&D characters :D
09-08-2019T01:07:13,AspiringNoodle,"SyFy wins tonight, lol"
09-08-2019T01:07:27,AspiringNoodle,Was just looking at stuff to watch on the boob tube
09-08-2019T01:07:42,AspiringNoodle,"And SyFy made a Freddy shark film, lol"
09-08-2019T01:09:01,AspiringNoodle,"If you're wondering what I mean, here's the plot synopsis"
09-08-2019T01:09:21,AspiringNoodle,"""Shark-attack survivors are hunted by a supernatural shark that haunts their dreams."""
09-08-2019T01:10:10,sunblaze,thats actually not such a bad idea for a script
09-08-2019T01:10:21,sunblaze,or was it done completly shoddy and bad?
09-08-2019T01:10:27,SageSaga,sounds like trash made by Asylum
09-08-2019T01:10:29,Dadrobit,"Legitimately have not looked at sci fi since Stargate SG-1 was in its first showing, and Battlestar Galactica was still the hottness..."
09-08-2019T01:10:48,AspiringNoodle,"Idk, film just started"
09-08-2019T01:11:01,AspiringNoodle,Shark looked like standard SyFy quality :ptv-laugh:
09-08-2019T01:11:15,AspiringNoodle,Not even 5 minutes in and we know shiz is about to go down
09-08-2019T01:11:53,SageSaga,whats the name of the movie?
09-08-2019T01:12:26,AspiringNoodle,"""Nightmare Shark"""
09-08-2019T01:12:33,SpazztasticKiwi,original
09-08-2019T01:12:42,AspiringNoodle,"Sooooooo, bland SyFy name, check :ptv-snicker:"
09-08-2019T01:12:43,SpazztasticKiwi,they’re not getting points for the name
09-08-2019T01:13:22,AspiringNoodle,I think my tolerance for crappy film is a result of binging scifi when I was younger
09-08-2019T01:13:29,AspiringNoodle,At least I'm slowly breaking out of it!
09-08-2019T01:13:34,SpazztasticKiwi,also Freddy is a copyrighted character
09-08-2019T01:13:48,SpazztasticKiwi,they’re skirting a bit of a line there
09-08-2019T01:13:54,sunblaze,my tolerance for crappy movies is based on RLM
09-08-2019T01:14:05,sunblaze,tooo many best of the worst episodes I guess
09-08-2019T01:14:08,Dadrobit,"Man, kinda want to watch SG-1 again now. Major Carter was legit probably my biggest crush back in the day."
09-08-2019T01:14:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I got distracted by food and facebook
09-08-2019T01:14:35,SpazztasticKiwi,so my hands were busy
09-08-2019T01:14:46,SpazztasticKiwi,oh and Bagheera showed up so I pets
09-08-2019T01:15:08,sunblaze,nuclear house kitten?
09-08-2019T01:15:25,Dadrobit,"Strong, smart, sexy. One of the best female leads out there."
09-08-2019T01:15:37,SpazztasticKiwi,he’s a bit like a nuclear bomb sometimes
09-08-2019T01:16:27,SpazztasticKiwi,or more like he’s a fuzz ball of organized chaos
09-08-2019T01:19:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom left without a nite
09-08-2019T01:19:17,SpazztasticKiwi,looks like about everyone did I guess
09-08-2019T01:19:58,SageSaga,Tom seems to still be without power?
09-08-2019T01:20:11,AspiringNoodle,"Oh no, did his stream end early?"
09-08-2019T01:20:11,SageSaga,From what i can see
09-08-2019T01:20:16,SageSaga,yeah
09-08-2019T01:20:41,SageSaga,hes probably upset about it though he probably didnt lose anything thanks to his UPS
09-08-2019T01:20:46,SpazztasticKiwi,ah well there’ll be a next time anyway
09-08-2019T01:20:54,AspiringNoodle,That reminds me
09-08-2019T01:20:57,SpazztasticKiwi,hopefully he didn’t loose anything
09-08-2019T01:21:00,AspiringNoodle,Invest in an UPS
09-08-2019T01:21:02,SpazztasticKiwi,or stub his toe
09-08-2019T01:21:12,SpazztasticKiwi,gotta have priorities
09-08-2019T01:21:16,HeresyArtStream,I have a UPS. Worth every penny.
09-08-2019T01:21:54,SageSaga,every UPS i have bought has died
09-08-2019T01:21:58,HeresyArtStream,My system can run for like half an hour even if Thor and Zeus threw lightning at my house at the same time. I do not fear the pagan gods.
09-08-2019T01:22:05,Dadrobit,UPS = emergency power supply?
09-08-2019T01:22:05,SpazztasticKiwi,that sounds reliable Sage
09-08-2019T01:22:12,AspiringNoodle,Pretty much
09-08-2019T01:22:29,AspiringNoodle,It's basically a giant battery that can keep a PC running for a bit if the power goes out
09-08-2019T01:22:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Thor and Zeus are from different cultures
09-08-2019T01:22:46,HeresyArtStream,"There was only one incident where there was a brownout and my UPS didn't switch over to battery and that was kind of alarming, but i wasn't drawing at the time."
09-08-2019T01:22:54,Bgrmystr2,"Uninterruptable Power Supply, Dadro"
09-08-2019T01:22:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Ones Norse and the other is Greek
09-08-2019T01:23:00,Bgrmystr2,and yeah used in case of emergencies
09-08-2019T01:23:08,Dadrobit,Been meaning to invest in one. Hard sell since it's easy to forget about storms here. So rare...
09-08-2019T01:23:18,AspiringNoodle,"For people like Tom, it's a blessing in disguise"
09-08-2019T01:23:29,AspiringNoodle,"Say you're working on something for the past hour and forget to save, then a blackout hits"
09-08-2019T01:23:33,HeresyArtStream,I'm both norse and greek so they probably both have a bone to pick with me.
09-08-2019T01:23:38,AspiringNoodle,"At least with the UPS, you'll have plenty of time to save'"
09-08-2019T01:23:48,SageSaga,if they didnt keep failing
09-08-2019T01:23:55,SpazztasticKiwi,but anyway I’ve GOT to go to bed
09-08-2019T01:23:56,Dadrobit,Usually just turn everything off and chill on my phone on the odd occurrence of a storm.
09-08-2019T01:24:02,unsteddyphoenix,gudnight~
09-08-2019T01:24:05,Bgrmystr2,"I don't have a UPS, but I have a monster of a surge supressor, so I'm good"
09-08-2019T01:24:11,Dadrobit,o/ spazz
09-08-2019T01:24:18,HeresyArtStream,night
09-08-2019T01:24:34,SpazztasticKiwi,was zoning out of Seáns video before I farted around here earlier
09-08-2019T01:24:39,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I do have everything in my house plugged into surge protectors for sure."
09-08-2019T01:24:43,SpazztasticKiwi,and there’s work tomorrow
09-08-2019T01:24:53,sunblaze,all I have is a candle amtches and 2 flashlights
09-08-2019T01:24:58,sunblaze,I feel left out :D
09-08-2019T01:24:59,SpazztasticKiwi,so I’m out 🛌
09-08-2019T01:25:12,SpazztasticKiwi,👋🏻
09-08-2019T01:25:17,sunblaze,bye kiwi
09-08-2019T01:26:16,Dadrobit,My equipment is way too fucking expensive to risk something surging and screwing anything up.
09-08-2019T01:26:35,AspiringNoodle,My fancy stuff is hooked into a surge protector
09-08-2019T01:26:41,AspiringNoodle,But not my tv / 4 consoles xD
09-08-2019T01:26:47,AspiringNoodle,*thinking*
09-08-2019T01:26:50,AspiringNoodle,*thinking*
09-08-2019T01:26:51,sunblaze,protection against lighting or surges in general is a msut yes
09-08-2019T01:26:53,AspiringNoodle,I'm a dummy
09-08-2019T01:27:02,sunblaze,but I do not think I need an extra PS
09-08-2019T01:27:39,HeresyArtStream,I have two surge protectors for my TV area and I have the UPS + a small cheapo surge protector for my computer area. The cheapo one is for things that aren't plugged in long-term.
09-08-2019T01:27:55,HeresyArtStream,I just needed more power outlets because I never have enough. x.x
09-08-2019T01:27:55,AspiringNoodle,"Tbh, a UPS isn't really necessary unless you do mission critical stuff"
09-08-2019T01:28:02,AspiringNoodle,"That or you flash your BIOS often, lol"
09-08-2019T01:28:14,HeresyArtStream,I'm an artist so I'd say my art is pretty mission critical. :V
09-08-2019T01:28:33,AspiringNoodle,That fits the bill
09-08-2019T01:28:34,Dadrobit,"Yeah, like I said, storms are rare, and I usually just turn everything off and chill until they're over."
09-08-2019T01:28:39,HeresyArtStream,I've lost pictures to power surges and that's made me incredibly mad. It's almost as bad as hard drive failure for me.
09-08-2019T01:28:48,HeresyArtStream,"(and I've lost art that way, too)"
09-08-2019T01:28:58,AspiringNoodle,"OMFG, you should watch this super old animation by Eric W. Schwartz xD"
09-08-2019T01:29:13,HeresyArtStream,The Amiga one? :B
09-08-2019T01:29:17,AspiringNoodle,Yup!
09-08-2019T01:29:19,AspiringNoodle,I lost it
09-08-2019T01:29:33,Dadrobit,HD failure is the absolute worst. I have everything double backed up externally now. I've learned my lessons...
09-08-2019T01:29:53,AspiringNoodle,"Goood man, my senior capstone drilled that home to us, too"
09-08-2019T01:30:03,HeresyArtStream,I should probably initiate a backup before I go on that road trip tomorrow. :eyes:
09-08-2019T01:30:04,AspiringNoodle,IT was a requirement that we have 2 backups
09-08-2019T01:30:17,SageSaga,currently whenever i save a picture it automatically gets uploaded to my cloud storage
09-08-2019T01:30:29,AspiringNoodle,"In my case, I had flash drives and used the school servers as my backup"
09-08-2019T01:30:47,AspiringNoodle,"So my home had 2 versions, and then the school was a separate backup in a different physical location"
09-08-2019T01:30:55,sunblaze,even the save inbetween?
09-08-2019T01:31:45,AspiringNoodle,Is there a way to have a backup configured so it has an up-to-date version of everything?
09-08-2019T01:31:57,Dadrobit,"Had a laptop HD fail, then found out my external drive had corrupted my project as well. Lost damn near everything on one project I'd been working on for over a month. Furious does not begin to cover how I felt."
09-08-2019T01:32:09,AspiringNoodle,"As in, save a file, backup updates to have the up-to-date file.  Delete a file, backup deletes it as well"
09-08-2019T01:32:25,SageSaga,its great because a few times ive saved over the wrong file
09-08-2019T01:32:35,SageSaga,and i just go to the cloud and restore the old version
09-08-2019T01:32:41,AspiringNoodle,^ Though that's a downside of what I'm thinking of doing xD
09-08-2019T01:32:52,AspiringNoodle,One oopsie and something gone for good
09-08-2019T01:33:19,AspiringNoodle,"Well, I'll be back in like 15 minutes"
09-08-2019T01:33:24,AspiringNoodle,Might as well shower and start the day :/
09-08-2019T01:34:30,Dadrobit,"That's why I version everything I save. ""Title [date]"""
09-08-2019T01:35:14,Dadrobit,"Prevents saving over anything. Sure, folders get huge, but storage is cheap, and options are invaluable."
09-08-2019T01:35:39,HeresyArtStream,I should really invest in a cloud storage solution.
09-08-2019T01:35:49,SageSaga,Dropbox good
09-08-2019T01:35:56,HeresyArtStream,I used that for a while. It's not bad.
09-08-2019T01:36:17,HeresyArtStream,I need to compare prices and see how good the integration into my desktop environment will be.
09-08-2019T01:49:13,Dadrobit,"Work calls, be back in a bit"
09-08-2019T01:49:27,SageSaga,alright
09-08-2019T01:51:06,sunblaze,afk as well.
09-08-2019T01:51:09,sunblaze,coffee time!
09-08-2019T01:55:24,SageSaga,=_= i forgot to pick up my medicine at the store today
09-08-2019T01:58:13,SageSaga,oh sweet they have later hours now on Saturday- i can pick em up before the stream tomorrow (aka later today)
09-08-2019T01:58:32,CrimsonQuill,Morning
09-08-2019T01:58:37,CrimsonQuill,:ptv-victory:
09-08-2019T01:59:40,SageSaga,yo Crim
09-08-2019T01:59:55,SageSaga,annnnd my connection to Picarto is going plop
09-08-2019T02:00:04,ZRO4825,D:
09-08-2019T02:00:30,SageSaga,"also lulz- ""CPU Usage 0.3%"""
09-08-2019T02:01:06,ZRO4825,lol
09-08-2019T02:01:20,MarvTheHugPharaoh,thats a nut amount of usage
09-08-2019T02:01:29,SageSaga,this CPU is a monster
09-08-2019T02:01:51,SageSaga,old system it used 7%
09-08-2019T02:03:38,AspiringNoodle,3900x? xD
09-08-2019T02:03:44,SageSaga,yes
09-08-2019T02:03:49,AspiringNoodle,I gots me a 3700x :D
09-08-2019T02:03:51,AspiringNoodle,And a 2070 super
09-08-2019T02:04:03,SageSaga,2080 Super
09-08-2019T02:04:12,AspiringNoodle,"I just couldn't justify them, tbh"
09-08-2019T02:04:45,AspiringNoodle,"The 3900x would only offer marginal improvements to in-game FPS, and by the time I need a 3900x, it would make more sense to just buy the 3700x and upgrade when the time is right"
09-08-2019T02:05:05,AspiringNoodle,"And I am referring to outside of gaming when I refer to ""needing"" a 3900x"
09-08-2019T02:05:26,AspiringNoodle,And the 2070 super was just a value proposition
09-08-2019T02:05:39,sunblaze,re
09-08-2019T02:05:54,SageSaga,wb
09-08-2019T02:06:44,SageSaga,i need to future proof my system as much as possible because it takes me so long to save up for a new one- im already saving up for the next one
09-08-2019T02:06:55,AspiringNoodle,I never stopped saving ;)
09-08-2019T02:07:14,sunblaze,my old one worked 9 years with only like 3 fails
09-08-2019T02:07:19,AspiringNoodle,"As it stands, I set aside a set amount of money every 2 weeks (though with this upcoming job I could do half weekly)"
09-08-2019T02:07:23,sunblaze,now the new one has to proof itself :D
09-08-2019T02:07:43,AspiringNoodle,hardware is only going to get more reliable as time goes on.  Quality has gone up
09-08-2019T02:07:51,CrimsonQuill,Porridge for Breakfast
09-08-2019T02:07:54,SageSaga,y'all know this song right?
09-08-2019T02:07:54,CrimsonQuill,And tea
09-08-2019T02:07:55,sunblaze,true
09-08-2019T02:07:56,CrimsonQuill,:)
09-08-2019T02:07:58,sunblaze,but prices as well
09-08-2019T02:08:02,AspiringNoodle,To the point where hardware WILL outlive its usefulness
09-08-2019T02:08:19,AspiringNoodle,"Tbh, my new computer is going to be overkill compared to my old system"
09-08-2019T02:08:21,HeresyArtStream,This song comes up in one of my playlists
09-08-2019T02:08:35,HeresyArtStream,"Ah, I think this is the same Chrono Trigger playlist I use"
09-08-2019T02:08:38,AspiringNoodle,Moving from an i5-3570k and gtx 970 <3
09-08-2019T02:09:03,AspiringNoodle,I started playing games made with RPGmaker recently
09-08-2019T02:09:17,AspiringNoodle,I think I'd like older JRPGs :)
09-08-2019T02:09:49,DarthRexKing,Goodnight.
09-08-2019T02:09:49,CrimsonQuill,turns sound on to see what song it is
09-08-2019T02:10:02,AspiringNoodle,"Sage, you considering upgrading to the last CPU in the AM4 line when the time comes?"
09-08-2019T02:10:07,AspiringNoodle,That's my plan
09-08-2019T02:10:23,CrimsonQuill,No idea what that song is
09-08-2019T02:10:26,CrimsonQuill,"Also, night rex"
09-08-2019T02:10:51,SageSaga,you mean the 3950x?
09-08-2019T02:10:53,AspiringNoodle,"Ofc, that hinges on AM4 ending in 3 - 4 years.  If it lasts another 5 years or longer, might be safer to just upgrade to a new mobo :ptv-laugh:"
09-08-2019T02:11:08,SageSaga,oh you mean the later one
09-08-2019T02:11:15,SageSaga,i dont think I will need to
09-08-2019T02:11:26,DarthRexKing,:3
09-08-2019T02:11:26,AspiringNoodle,I'm talking down the line when they will finally move to a new socket
09-08-2019T02:11:35,AspiringNoodle,There's rumors of 3 - 4 threads per core in the future
09-08-2019T02:11:46,AspiringNoodle,And it could even potentially be on AM4
09-08-2019T02:13:13,AspiringNoodle,"Oh no, that poor ball"
09-08-2019T02:13:16,AspiringNoodle,It gonna go *pop*
09-08-2019T02:16:33,SageSaga,hmm
09-08-2019T02:16:41,SageSaga,ok well my tablet stopped working in Clip
09-08-2019T02:16:53,sunblaze,:ptv-sad:
09-08-2019T02:17:06,SageSaga,this has happened before but i hoped with the new computer the issue would be solved- and with the new drivers-
09-08-2019T02:17:28,SageSaga,which means it's something else... maybe windows tablet settings are interfering
09-08-2019T02:17:53,sunblaze,np we are gonna watch Kaylin getting spooked all day then :D
09-08-2019T02:18:40,SageSaga,i still gotta figure out the cause though
09-08-2019T02:18:47,SageSaga,or else its going to just keep happening
09-08-2019T02:19:03,SageSaga,=_= i looked for hours over a year ago though and found nothing
09-08-2019T02:19:10,CrimsonQuill,Hey Sage
09-08-2019T02:19:15,SageSaga,yo
09-08-2019T02:19:18,CrimsonQuill,I've tried getting back into Yosh
09-08-2019T02:19:25,CrimsonQuill,But the archive doesn't work
09-08-2019T02:19:35,SageSaga,it does
09-08-2019T02:19:41,SageSaga,there just isnt a link to it
09-08-2019T02:19:48,CrimsonQuill,So all I've been able to read is Baldy having his arse handed to him and Phil swing swonging his big staff.

09-08-2019T02:20:03,CrimsonQuill,"(By the way, it's really cool how he's taken a level in badass)"
09-08-2019T02:20:12,sunblaze,thats the best scene anyway crimson :D
09-08-2019T02:20:17,sunblaze,nothing missed
09-08-2019T02:20:29,CrimsonQuill,"Oh, thanks"
09-08-2019T02:20:30,SageSaga,Zro linked the archive :D
09-08-2019T02:20:32,SageSaga,XD
09-08-2019T02:20:36,CrimsonQuill,Thanks Zro
09-08-2019T02:20:49,ZRO4825,I bookmarked after the last time I asked about it myself. :P
09-08-2019T02:20:51,CrimsonQuill,"Also,...who the heck is Miss Death? Is she one of those two mages?"
09-08-2019T02:20:56,ZRO4825,Yus.
09-08-2019T02:21:01,ZRO4825,Life and Death. The Twins.
09-08-2019T02:21:08,sunblaze,death and life are the 2 mages yes
09-08-2019T02:21:13,CrimsonQuill,Figured
09-08-2019T02:21:33,sunblaze,imagine  L
09-08-2019T02:21:39,sunblaze,but without need of a book :D
09-08-2019T02:21:45,CrimsonQuill,I do wonder
09-08-2019T02:21:49,CrimsonQuill,Is it the end?
09-08-2019T02:21:53,CrimsonQuill,I doubt it
09-08-2019T02:22:15,CrimsonQuill,It has a feel of a final battle
09-08-2019T02:22:16,ZRO4825,:thinking:  Can't be the end yet.
09-08-2019T02:22:19,CrimsonQuill,But then again
09-08-2019T02:22:46,sunblaze,jsut becuase the fight ends sometime does not mean the problems will dissapear magically
09-08-2019T02:22:48,CrimsonQuill,I haven't been reading the stuff in between Whatshername becoming the new fire mage and Baldy getting his face smashed.
09-08-2019T02:22:58,CrimsonQuill,True that
09-08-2019T02:23:07,Dadrobit,Well fuck. That was not fun.
09-08-2019T02:23:10,CrimsonQuill,There's a quote from Terry Pratchett
09-08-2019T02:23:16,CrimsonQuill,@Dadribit Hi Dad
09-08-2019T02:23:26,CrimsonQuill,@Dadrobit
09-08-2019T02:23:33,Dadrobit,"Remember the ""1% oh shit, this is an emergency"" I mentioned."
09-08-2019T02:23:38,sunblaze,may TP he rest in pieces yes
09-08-2019T02:23:54,CrimsonQuill,"Not really Robit, I wasn't there."
09-08-2019T02:24:01,Dadrobit,Just had that come through my door.
09-08-2019T02:24:15,CrimsonQuill,Oh. Kay.
09-08-2019T02:24:19,sunblaze,remember those one in a million chances
09-08-2019T02:24:22,sunblaze,they happen!
09-08-2019T02:24:27,CrimsonQuill,9 times out of 10
09-08-2019T02:24:42,Dadrobit,The gate I operate from has a community that has its own country club and golf course.
09-08-2019T02:25:00,Dadrobit,This country club has its own security firm guarding it.
09-08-2019T02:25:11,CrimsonQuill,Is the gate jammed or broken?
09-08-2019T02:25:27,Dadrobit,"The guy working tonight is physically handicapped, and a bit slow on the mental draw to boot."
09-08-2019T02:25:47,ZRO4825,...and he's working SECURITY?
09-08-2019T02:25:54,CrimsonQuill,Oh dear.
09-08-2019T02:26:01,sunblaze,must be a chill zone :P
09-08-2019T02:26:14,Dadrobit,The overnight cleaning ladies got spooked by a pack of javelins and the guard tried to scare them off by hobbling towards them.
09-08-2019T02:26:33,Dadrobit,Javelinas*
09-08-2019T02:26:46,CrimsonQuill,I'm guessing an ambulance was required.
09-08-2019T02:27:00,ZRO4825,New animal name learned tonight~
09-08-2019T02:27:39,Dadrobit,"One of them charged, knocked him over, and bit the SHIT out of his arm. The cleaning ladies dragged him into a supply shed and locked themselves in to escape before they called me."
09-08-2019T02:27:44,sunblaze,I thought someone was either throwing spears at them
09-08-2019T02:27:50,sunblaze,or shooting anti-tank missles :D
09-08-2019T02:27:55,sunblaze,both was wierd
09-08-2019T02:28:13,SageSaga,XD
09-08-2019T02:28:24,SageSaga,omg you got Feral Boared
09-08-2019T02:28:38,CrimsonQuill,Oh crumbs
09-08-2019T02:28:40,CrimsonQuill,Poor man
09-08-2019T02:28:55,SageSaga,I hope he's ok
09-08-2019T02:28:57,Dadrobit,I scared them off with the truck spotlights and horn before I was able to get into the shed.
09-08-2019T02:29:11,SageSaga,did you say the line?
09-08-2019T02:29:17,CrimsonQuill,Is he going to be ok?
09-08-2019T02:29:17,SageSaga,"""Come with me if you want to live"""
09-08-2019T02:29:27,sunblaze,^
09-08-2019T02:29:46,CrimsonQuill,"@SageSaga with respect Sage, I doubt that any of us would really think about it when someone needs to go to hospital."
09-08-2019T02:30:05,CrimsonQuill,Plus it'd scare the patient a bit
09-08-2019T02:30:07,Dadrobit,"The dude was very fucked up. Needed an ambulance for sure. The tusks penetrated both sides of his forearm and bicep of the arm he tried guarding himself with, and I think he had a broken ankle."
09-08-2019T02:30:11,sunblaze,depends of your level of nerd
09-08-2019T02:30:22,sunblaze,it might be snarky and stupid
09-08-2019T02:30:23,CrimsonQuill,Ooof.
09-08-2019T02:30:33,sunblaze,but it would not have made a difference in helpoing them
09-08-2019T02:30:39,SageSaga,you underestimate people like me who use humor in serious situations as a copping mechanism
09-08-2019T02:30:49,CrimsonQuill,@SageSaga like my sister
09-08-2019T02:30:56,CrimsonQuill,She does that too
09-08-2019T02:31:03,CrimsonQuill,Her sense of humour is very dark as a result
09-08-2019T02:31:10,sunblaze,so they bit him HARD?
09-08-2019T02:31:17,sunblaze,what a strange situation
09-08-2019T02:31:32,CrimsonQuill,"@Sunblaze by the sounds of it, that guy'll be in hospital for months."
09-08-2019T02:31:33,sunblaze,also yes human bite-salvia can be dangerous
09-08-2019T02:32:11,ZRO4825,Don't think so. Maybe a week or two at most.
09-08-2019T02:32:50,Dadrobit,I was prepared to use humor when I heard the cleaning lady cry about being locked in a shed to get away from the javelinas. The humor stopped right fuckin quick when I saw the dude lying in a pool of blood.
09-08-2019T02:33:08,CrimsonQuill,Just looked up what Javelinas are
09-08-2019T02:33:11,CrimsonQuill,And...ouch.
09-08-2019T02:33:26,Dadrobit,"Sunglass, you ever seen javelina tusks?"
09-08-2019T02:33:35,Dadrobit,Sunblaze*
09-08-2019T02:33:35,CrimsonQuill,Huge things
09-08-2019T02:33:46,sunblaze,nope I am in europe
09-08-2019T02:33:56,sunblaze,wild biards have scary enough tusks
09-08-2019T02:33:59,CrimsonQuill,@Sunblaze look up a picture
09-08-2019T02:34:02,sunblaze,wild boars
09-08-2019T02:34:05,CrimsonQuill,I just did
09-08-2019T02:34:09,sunblaze,I already did
09-08-2019T02:34:15,Dadrobit,"Think warthog, but made out of pure rage and skunk musk."
09-08-2019T02:34:24,SageSaga,have y'all not seen the feral hog meme?
09-08-2019T02:34:28,AspiringNoodle,^
09-08-2019T02:34:29,CrimsonQuill,Was anyone else hurt?
09-08-2019T02:34:35,sunblaze,not me at least?
09-08-2019T02:34:44,ZRO4825,"I have not, Sage. Not that that is unusual, I tend to avoid most memes."
09-08-2019T02:34:53,MarvTheHugPharaoh,40-50 wild hogs
09-08-2019T02:34:55,Dadrobit,"Naw, the ladies were upset, they went home for the night after mopping up."
09-08-2019T02:34:57,AspiringNoodle,It's a meme centered around the gun debate
09-08-2019T02:35:09,AspiringNoodle,And actually points out a legitimate reason to own firearms
09-08-2019T02:35:21,sunblaze,how did they get in? if it was a gated community should there not be fence all around?
09-08-2019T02:35:39,AspiringNoodle,^
09-08-2019T02:35:48,SageSaga,no antigun person is against guns in those circumstances
09-08-2019T02:35:54,CrimsonQuill,@Sunblaze Dadrobit just said that the man was physically handicapped and had slow reflexes.
09-08-2019T02:35:57,ZRO4825,"From the sounds of it, they were not inside the gates at the time."
09-08-2019T02:36:04,AspiringNoodle,"Sage, don't underestimate anti-gunners"
09-08-2019T02:36:05,CrimsonQuill,I'm guessing he wasn't able to close the gate in time
09-08-2019T02:36:13,sunblaze,the hogs you kidder not the man or the cleaning ladies
09-08-2019T02:36:15,CrimsonQuill,Either that or what Zro said
09-08-2019T02:36:25,AspiringNoodle,There are people with zero knowledge / experience with guns who will say no guns under any circumstance
09-08-2019T02:36:26,sunblaze,hm perhaps yes
09-08-2019T02:36:29,Dadrobit,It's gated for the road access. But it's an open desert otherwise. The community is massive and is built into the side of a mountain and into their valleys.
09-08-2019T02:36:42,sunblaze,ah ok fair enough
09-08-2019T02:36:43,CrimsonQuill,"Ah, that explains it."
09-08-2019T02:36:53,SageSaga,yeah and there are people who think we need guns on every street corner
09-08-2019T02:36:54,AspiringNoodle,I theorized that was the case :)
09-08-2019T02:37:06,CrimsonQuill,One needs a gun license over here
09-08-2019T02:37:13,AspiringNoodle,That or those hogs made / found a hole in the fence
09-08-2019T02:37:17,sunblaze,we need guns! to battle the guns that are all over!
09-08-2019T02:37:21,SageSaga,neither of those idiots are worth mentioning though- so no one is really against guns like that
09-08-2019T02:37:22,sunblaze,me: what?
09-08-2019T02:37:25,CrimsonQuill,"And even with one, the most you'll see are airguns, shotguns and pellet guns"
09-08-2019T02:37:27,ZRO4825,Gun debate is summed easily. We've got nuts on both ends of the spectrum and no one vocal likes to be in the middle ground.
09-08-2019T02:37:42,CrimsonQuill,Nicely put Zro
09-08-2019T02:37:54,sunblaze,I can see that yes
09-08-2019T02:38:01,AspiringNoodle,And only one side that tends to know what they're talking about :ptv-snicker:
09-08-2019T02:38:09,CrimsonQuill,...
09-08-2019T02:38:10,AspiringNoodle,But they're also the ones that are full-on unrestricted 2nd
09-08-2019T02:38:17,AspiringNoodle,"Soooooooo, neutral?"
09-08-2019T02:38:24,SageSaga,im anti gun
09-08-2019T02:38:33,ZRO4825,"Well, if they're on one ""side"", then no, not neutral."
09-08-2019T02:38:41,sunblaze,if you only have 2 sides of the coin: use the small edge and deny choosing!
09-08-2019T02:38:41,ZRO4825,I see points for both sides of the argument.
09-08-2019T02:38:52,CrimsonQuill,I can't really say anything because I don't live there.
09-08-2019T02:38:59,AspiringNoodle,"I'll be honest, I hate the people who want to ban guns, but then make up all sorts of BS to justify their positions"
09-08-2019T02:39:08,AspiringNoodle,"Who can forget the whole ""ghost gun"" fiasco"
09-08-2019T02:39:30,SageSaga,cool - ya hate me then
09-08-2019T02:39:39,Dadrobit,"Nah, no major fences around aside from the front access. The wildlife has free reign to get in everywhere else. Javelinas, coyotes, even a particular mountain lion hangs out in the area. Goes to the golf course lakes for a drink in the morning."
09-08-2019T02:39:43,AspiringNoodle,"I can't say that, Sage"
09-08-2019T02:39:58,SageSaga,you just said you did
09-08-2019T02:40:09,CrimsonQuill,I'd love to see a mountain lion
09-08-2019T02:40:10,AspiringNoodle,Have you made up complete falsehoods to justify your positions? ;D
09-08-2019T02:40:12,sunblaze,I am not familliar with US in that case. but we have like zero guns here. only hunting ones on professional hunters and those that do it for sports (apart from police and military)
09-08-2019T02:40:23,CrimsonQuill,"Then I could say, 'There's a kind of big cat or something'"
09-08-2019T02:40:31,CrimsonQuill,And my brother could finish the RvB reference
09-08-2019T02:40:32,ZRO4825,"Eh...realistically, it comes down to the factor of the guns themselves not being the REAL problem. The real issue is the lack of mental health and wellness in our country as a result of overstressed people, and pyschosis prone individuals being ignored."
09-08-2019T02:41:02,sunblaze,I can see the need for some serious weaponry in your case dadrobit. but in general? nah
09-08-2019T02:41:07,SageSaga,=_= its not a mental health issue
09-08-2019T02:41:16,ZRO4825,No? You don't think so?
09-08-2019T02:41:22,AspiringNoodle,"It is, and it isn't"
09-08-2019T02:41:24,ZRO4825,"So the guns just up and shoot themselves at people, eh?"
09-08-2019T02:41:24,SageSaga,most people with mental health issues dont use violence on other people
09-08-2019T02:41:27,JeremySenpai,:cjeremysenpai-Yo:yo
09-08-2019T02:41:33,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Jeremy
09-08-2019T02:41:44,unsteddyphoenix,Wait sage did you just say you make up bs to justify your positions?
09-08-2019T02:41:46,SageSaga,these people arent mentally ill- they are angry
09-08-2019T02:41:51,AspiringNoodle,Statistics says that only 25% of mass shooters have had mental illness
09-08-2019T02:42:01,AspiringNoodle,But ALL of them have had some sort of mental stress
09-08-2019T02:42:07,AspiringNoodle,So there's something else at work
09-08-2019T02:42:11,SageSaga,No Unsteady- noodle said he hates people who want to ban guns
09-08-2019T02:42:15,ZRO4825,Overabundant anger is a mental health issue of its own. There's a reason court cases can be excused due to insanity.
09-08-2019T02:42:27,sunblaze,thats not BS I can back that claim. we have some mental issies in family as well. still no violence. sadness and scremaing and BS yes nothing more
09-08-2019T02:42:29,AspiringNoodle,"""I'll be honest, I hate the people who want to ban guns, but then make up all sorts of BS to justify their positions"""
09-08-2019T02:42:41,sunblaze,they are to distraced to even think of that
09-08-2019T02:42:48,AspiringNoodle,I hate the people who make complete fabrications / pull bs out of their butts
09-08-2019T02:42:51,Bgrmystr2,":thinking: I dunno noodle, context has never meant anything here."
09-08-2019T02:42:54,SageSaga,Zro- you are painting with too wide a brush
09-08-2019T02:42:57,JeremySenpai,is Australian and will keep his mouth shut
09-08-2019T02:42:59,ZRO4825,"Not every mental health issue will involve violence, and not every violent situation will involve mental health issues."
09-08-2019T02:43:00,AspiringNoodle,"If you have actual, legitimate info, I'm willing to debate :D"
09-08-2019T02:43:20,unsteddyphoenix,Gotta read the whole statement
09-08-2019T02:43:56,AspiringNoodle,"Here are things I approve of: Universal Background checks.  Quick, easy, non-intrusive way to block sales"
09-08-2019T02:44:06,ZRO4825,We already have background checks.
09-08-2019T02:44:15,SageSaga,I want to get rid of the 2nd amendment
09-08-2019T02:44:17,AspiringNoodle,"From what I've read, they aren't extremely comprehensive"
09-08-2019T02:44:37,Dadrobit,"Yeah, form 4473 is already a thing."
09-08-2019T02:44:37,SageSaga,have it so people can still own guns- but it not be a right
09-08-2019T02:44:49,Bgrmystr2,the 2nd amendment is supposed to protect us from a corrupt government.
09-08-2019T02:44:50,AspiringNoodle,"That's a potential problem, Sage"
09-08-2019T02:44:52,AspiringNoodle,^
09-08-2019T02:44:58,SageSaga,but it cant
09-08-2019T02:45:06,AspiringNoodle,You'd be surprised
09-08-2019T02:45:13,AspiringNoodle,Tyranny starts small
09-08-2019T02:45:14,SageSaga,guns dont beat tanks
09-08-2019T02:45:22,AspiringNoodle,It's not the army you have to worry about
09-08-2019T02:45:26,AspiringNoodle,It's the secret police
09-08-2019T02:45:34,AspiringNoodle,"The ones who make people ""disappear"" at night"
09-08-2019T02:45:36,Dadrobit,"Prevents felons, convicted violent nonfelons, and those who have been in a mental hospital for 3+ days within the last 5 years from owning guns."
09-08-2019T02:45:39,SageSaga,omg
09-08-2019T02:45:46,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Thats why we have the hells angles, who have Apache helicopters"
09-08-2019T02:45:54,SageSaga,"look - a gun wont stop the ""secret police"" either"
09-08-2019T02:45:58,sunblaze,yes and how can guns help against them? they are secret for a reason. the minute they reveal themselves to you you are already bonked
09-08-2019T02:46:10,ZRO4825,"Let's be realistic. If by chance the military ever actually gets aimed at our own citizens, and cooperates, the citizenry is double-fucked. Guns or not."
09-08-2019T02:46:19,SageSaga,guns make you think you are safe- but the truth is you arent
09-08-2019T02:46:40,ZRO4825,Guns are at best a weapon to put you on even grounds with the man aiming one at you.
09-08-2019T02:46:40,AspiringNoodle,Even the military isn't a be-all end-all
09-08-2019T02:46:41,SageSaga,it's a placibo
09-08-2019T02:46:52,Dadrobit,"Yeah, tbh, look at what happened to the dude in Oregon that tried his armed rebellion."
09-08-2019T02:47:09,SageSaga,your guns and unorganized civilians arent going to fight a government- information can
09-08-2019T02:47:55,SageSaga,the media should be your gun- but it's more your entertainment now
09-08-2019T02:48:32,Bgrmystr2,"for a corrupt government, the media is the first thing the people lose."
09-08-2019T02:48:52,SageSaga,yep so they have to do what they can to hold onto it and look at other countries
09-08-2019T02:49:03,AspiringNoodle,"Historically speaking, corruption works in waves"
09-08-2019T02:49:11,Bgrmystr2,so relying on the media is absolutely not the way to go
09-08-2019T02:49:12,AspiringNoodle,First with the suppression of information / artists
09-08-2019T02:49:15,SageSaga,if they get cut off from that- the only thing they can do is refuse
09-08-2019T02:49:20,AspiringNoodle,Then disarming the citizens
09-08-2019T02:49:25,AspiringNoodle,Then the suppression of dissent
09-08-2019T02:49:29,SageSaga,and relying on guns is just going to make you think you are safer
09-08-2019T02:49:39,Dadrobit,"I'm pro second Amendment, but I have no delusion that even with everything I own, I'd be toast if the govt. wanted me dead for some stupid reason."
09-08-2019T02:49:56,SageSaga,im fine with people owning guns
09-08-2019T02:50:03,SageSaga,i just think they shouldnt be a right
09-08-2019T02:50:17,Bgrmystr2,then I guess we should live like people in China do :u
09-08-2019T02:50:18,SageSaga,like a Car
09-08-2019T02:50:22,AspiringNoodle,"But again, if they aren't a right, the government can revoke your ability to own guns at any given moment"
09-08-2019T02:50:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,So you don't agree to the right of self preservation?
09-08-2019T02:50:39,SageSaga,Hong Kongs protests have been successful so far
09-08-2019T02:50:45,AspiringNoodle,"Without that right, they could literally say ""you can't own guns anymore, turn them in or face consequences"""
09-08-2019T02:50:59,JeremySenpai,Hold Up
09-08-2019T02:51:03,sunblaze,^thats what permits are for
09-08-2019T02:51:11,JeremySenpai,As a country that had that
09-08-2019T02:51:16,JeremySenpai,happen
09-08-2019T02:51:23,JeremySenpai,it don't work that way
09-08-2019T02:51:29,ZRO4825,"The catch here is, the government can overturn that amendment at any point they REALLY want to."
09-08-2019T02:51:54,Bgrmystr2,"""Congress shall make no law"" is pretty difficult to overturn, just sayin"
09-08-2019T02:52:25,Dadrobit,"Problem is, even folks with suspended liscenses get behind the wheel anyways."
09-08-2019T02:52:29,AspiringNoodle,"We can repeal the 2nd amendment, it'd just be really really REALLY effin' hard"
09-08-2019T02:52:31,JeremySenpai,We can still own guns and hunt ect. BUT we cant own Semi-full auto Rifles
09-08-2019T02:52:41,JeremySenpai,or hand gunds
09-08-2019T02:52:43,AspiringNoodle,2/3 majority in both house and Senate + ratified by 38 states
09-08-2019T02:52:52,JeremySenpai,unless part of a club
09-08-2019T02:52:53,AspiringNoodle,^ TRIGGERED
09-08-2019T02:53:01,SageSaga,someone want to tell me why we have so many mass shootings in the US? Because we know its not Video games
09-08-2019T02:53:09,AspiringNoodle,"Sage, here's a better question"
09-08-2019T02:53:16,Dadrobit,Media glorification
09-08-2019T02:53:19,unsteddyphoenix,^
09-08-2019T02:53:20,AspiringNoodle,"We've had guns for a LONG time, and it's only gotten harder to buy them"
09-08-2019T02:53:45,AspiringNoodle,"so why was it, back in the 50's / 60's, when you could walk into a sporting goods store buy a gun, and they'd even giftwrap it for you, no checks or anything"
09-08-2019T02:53:51,AspiringNoodle,Mass shootings weren't a problem?
09-08-2019T02:54:09,JeremySenpai,peoples Ideology was different back then
09-08-2019T02:54:35,ZRO4825,"Not as many people being treated like shit back then, your poor class of citizenry could still actually afford things, you didn't work like a dog to not make a damned bit of difference in your debt, prices have inflated terribly while wages haven't..."
09-08-2019T02:54:40,ZRO4825,The list goes on and on and on.
09-08-2019T02:55:01,JeremySenpai,Knocks noodles theroy out of the park with logic
09-08-2019T02:55:06,Dadrobit,"Media puts it in folks heads, ""This is the best way to get attention"". Look at Japan. Since the Kyoto fire attack, folks are getting arrested left and right for planning and threatening their own attacks."
09-08-2019T02:55:15,SageSaga,yeah my grandfather bought a house for less than what my PC cost
09-08-2019T02:55:29,AspiringNoodle,"Jeremy, you're probably right"
09-08-2019T02:55:44,AspiringNoodle,I'm probably just guilty right there of pulling bs out my ass like I say I hate it when other people do :/
09-08-2019T02:55:50,MarvTheHugPharaoh,you also didn't have shuan king and aziz ansari on twitter demanding violence towards people who disagree politically
09-08-2019T02:55:51,JeremySenpai,:ptv-condescending:Probably
09-08-2019T02:56:22,AspiringNoodle,"Wow, background checks are actually REALLY modern"
09-08-2019T02:56:29,SageSaga,im not against guns - i get some people live in a forest surrounded by bears! That's fine! Some people just like shooting guns! Im fine with that too!
09-08-2019T02:57:10,SageSaga,But I just hate seeing that some angry kid was able to murder 20+ people in a few seconds with a weapon obtained legally or illegally
09-08-2019T02:57:19,AspiringNoodle,"I'm talking, mandated in 1993 by the Brady Law and launched in 1998 by the FBI"
09-08-2019T02:57:30,AspiringNoodle,"However, Sage, that's taking the easy route"
09-08-2019T02:57:39,JeremySenpai,I has a good friend trying for the worlds  longest shot BTW
09-08-2019T02:57:41,AspiringNoodle,It's more or less treating the symptom and not the cause
09-08-2019T02:57:48,SageSaga,you idiot
09-08-2019T02:57:56,SageSaga,"you think im saying ""just get rid of guns""?"
09-08-2019T02:58:11,AspiringNoodle,"Okay, fair point"
09-08-2019T02:58:16,AspiringNoodle,Statement retracted
09-08-2019T02:58:22,SageSaga,thank you
09-08-2019T02:58:33,Bgrmystr2,"Well, if all guns just mysteriously vanished.. :thinking:"
09-08-2019T02:58:35,SageSaga,I think it's just one thing we should look into - maybe even try
09-08-2019T02:58:46,SageSaga,we still have plenty of other things to look into too though
09-08-2019T02:58:49,AspiringNoodle,"BUT, we must be careful when it comes to repealing the 2nd amendment"
09-08-2019T02:58:51,SageSaga,and i want all that done as well
09-08-2019T02:59:03,SageSaga,modify it then
09-08-2019T02:59:25,SageSaga,just dont give a lobby group something where they can fight for the right for a blind man to have a gun
09-08-2019T02:59:53,Dadrobit,"And some of us live at the dead end of streets with quarterly SWAT raids at the local crack houses, only to see gun toting crackheads still wandering the streets at 2am... Fuckin' Pandora's box man. Guns are too easy to get illegally."
09-08-2019T03:00:11,AspiringNoodle,Depends on where you live
09-08-2019T03:00:20,SageSaga,a lot of illegally obtained guns were obtained legally first
09-08-2019T03:00:25,AspiringNoodle,^
09-08-2019T03:00:42,JeremySenpai,:cjeremysenpai-ezgifcom-crop2:
09-08-2019T03:00:46,SageSaga,so if you can do a better job at preventing that im all for
09-08-2019T03:00:55,SageSaga,it*
09-08-2019T03:00:57,Dadrobit,For sure. Craigslist trades are fucking impossible to regulate.
09-08-2019T03:01:00,ZRO4825,"Problem is that at this point there's so many guns in circulation, cutting off those who obtain them legally only hurts those who're doing so legally. It won't stop those gaining them illegally. =("
09-08-2019T03:01:13,Bgrmystr2,yeah there's too damn many already
09-08-2019T03:01:25,AspiringNoodle,"Guns last too long, change my mind"
09-08-2019T03:01:26,AspiringNoodle,Lmao
09-08-2019T03:01:27,Bgrmystr2,"even trying to remove all the legally gained ones, there's still so many"
09-08-2019T03:01:47,AspiringNoodle,There are multiple ways people obtain guns illegally
09-08-2019T03:01:49,Bgrmystr2,and you've just taken away a primary source of self-protection
09-08-2019T03:01:54,SageSaga,are you saying- maybe we should get rid of - SOME guns? XD
09-08-2019T03:02:04,JeremySenpai,My country offers every year the chance to hand in any and i do mean ANY illegal weapons with a no harm no foul approch
09-08-2019T03:02:14,AspiringNoodle,"Australia, right?"
09-08-2019T03:02:23,JeremySenpai,you should see the shit that gets handed in
09-08-2019T03:02:26,JeremySenpai,Ye
09-08-2019T03:02:34,AspiringNoodle,I've heard that participation rates are piss poor xD
09-08-2019T03:02:50,SageSaga,of course you hear that
09-08-2019T03:02:56,Dadrobit,"Yeah, the ones obtained illegally, hells yes. And put the idiots that bought them behind bars longer, and track the tickets that are selling them freely down as well."
09-08-2019T03:03:03,JeremySenpai,In what per say?
09-08-2019T03:03:04,SageSaga,you have a bias probably as bad as i do :P
09-08-2019T03:03:19,AspiringNoodle,"Sage, that's actually something you probably didn't know"
09-08-2019T03:03:25,SageSaga,bull crap
09-08-2019T03:03:30,Dadrobit,Tickets-fuckers*
09-08-2019T03:03:30,SageSaga,ive heard the numbers
09-08-2019T03:03:32,AspiringNoodle,There are laws on the books for people who use guns obtained illegally
09-08-2019T03:03:47,SageSaga,ive seen the debates im familiar with it
09-08-2019T03:03:48,AspiringNoodle,"The problem is, they're the first fucking thing lawyers get tossed"
09-08-2019T03:04:11,AspiringNoodle,"We have so many gun laws on the books, but there's an enforcement / sentencing problem"
09-08-2019T03:04:28,SageSaga,Im not against cleaning up laws
09-08-2019T03:04:30,AspiringNoodle,"When I learned about the illegal gun charges being dropped basically every time, I was so pissed"
09-08-2019T03:05:17,AspiringNoodle,"If the laws for obtaining guns illegally were enforced and much harsher, the rates might actually start going down :/"
09-08-2019T03:05:30,SageSaga,the murder rates?
09-08-2019T03:05:32,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"I am a simple man and I believe in a simple thing, the government knows my guns and knows they are in my name.  I only use them in the woods and at a range.  They are mine and mine alone......fuck off"
09-08-2019T03:05:39,CrimsonQuill,"Well, I need to study. See you later guys."
09-08-2019T03:05:49,ZRO4825,"Take care, Quill"
09-08-2019T03:05:50,AspiringNoodle,Or at least the number of illegal guns / number of people using guns illegally on the street
09-08-2019T03:06:09,AspiringNoodle,"Using an illegally obtained gun in the commission of a crime is supposed to add 5 years, miminum"
09-08-2019T03:06:42,JeremySenpai,Can I ask a question Noodle
09-08-2019T03:06:46,AspiringNoodle,Go for it
09-08-2019T03:06:57,ZRO4825,"The real question is...my next Final Fantasy based commision...my Mithra, my Miqo'te, or my fresh out of the box Viera? :thinking:"
09-08-2019T03:06:59,JeremySenpai,Do you own a weapon for protection
09-08-2019T03:07:03,Dadrobit,That gun trade in thing happened in the states recently at one police station sponsored event. They tweeted pictures of their haul. It was all like antique stuff. Muskets and old revolvers. Basically just family heirlooms that the current owners had no
09-08-2019T03:07:08,Dadrobit,Connection to
09-08-2019T03:07:19,AspiringNoodle,"Not yet.  Considering it, and hope to never have to use it"
09-08-2019T03:07:34,JeremySenpai,Sorry for the link sage

09-08-2019T03:08:08,JeremySenpai,I see this shit and wonder would you have time to pull it. remove safety aim and fire?
09-08-2019T03:08:10,SageSaga,next time say what it is first
09-08-2019T03:08:27,JeremySenpai,:ptv-sneakysmirk:
09-08-2019T03:08:36,AspiringNoodle,"Jeremy, that's not a fair situation"
09-08-2019T03:08:54,JeremySenpai,They ver very RARELY are
09-08-2019T03:08:59,Dadrobit,"Yeah, sure as shit wasn't fair to the victim either."
09-08-2019T03:09:00,SageSaga,I was hoping Noodle was going to say the gun ban made the homicide rates go up in Australia
09-08-2019T03:09:08,AspiringNoodle,Nope
09-08-2019T03:09:08,JeremySenpai,I have Miltary training
09-08-2019T03:09:13,AspiringNoodle,"They actually made no difference, lol"
09-08-2019T03:09:32,AspiringNoodle,"There was a small dip initially, but then rates returned to normal (decline over time and all)"
09-08-2019T03:09:39,SageSaga,well thats more true than making it worse- the truth is we dont know if it did or didnt
09-08-2019T03:09:58,SageSaga,since overall they have gone down and stayed down statistically
09-08-2019T03:10:02,AspiringNoodle,"Statistically speaking, there was no statiscally significant change in the rates"
09-08-2019T03:10:04,Dadrobit,"As I understand it, it declined, but only at the same rate it was already declining."
09-08-2019T03:10:09,JeremySenpai,the time it takes to recognise a weapon REMOVE the holster strap remove the weapon flick safty and aim is a looong fkn time
09-08-2019T03:10:15,JeremySenpai,in bullet terms
09-08-2019T03:10:33,AspiringNoodle,"Jeremy, first thing self-defense teachers will teach you is that how you die"
09-08-2019T03:10:50,JeremySenpai,the best defence is some thing soild
09-08-2019T03:10:56,SageSaga,you are more likely to have someone who lives in the home die from a gun in the house than use it to defend yourself ever
09-08-2019T03:10:58,JeremySenpai,like a post box
09-08-2019T03:11:00,AspiringNoodle,"If you carry for defense, and the gun is in the holster, safety off, hammer cocked"
09-08-2019T03:11:18,JeremySenpai,^good way to get arrested
09-08-2019T03:11:22,ZRO4825,That sounds like a good way to have an accidental discharge go off in your leg.
09-08-2019T03:11:30,JeremySenpai,:cjeremysenpai-ezgifcom-crop2:
09-08-2019T03:11:32,SageSaga,yep
09-08-2019T03:11:33,AspiringNoodle,That or use a gun with a double trigger
09-08-2019T03:11:39,SageSaga,XD
09-08-2019T03:11:40,AspiringNoodle,One that also cocks the hammer
09-08-2019T03:11:51,JeremySenpai,hold up
09-08-2019T03:11:56,JeremySenpai,I never said cock
09-08-2019T03:12:04,JeremySenpai,I said release safty
09-08-2019T03:12:34,JeremySenpai,I assumed for your sake you would be dumb enough to walk around with one in the chamber
09-08-2019T03:12:51,SageSaga,you are better off developing cybernetic enhancements to identify threats and draw your weapon for you than finding a way to make a gun easier to fire from the hip on your own before an intruder can
09-08-2019T03:13:10,Dadrobit,"If you're worried about an accidental discharge, walk around for a few weeks with the weapon cocked, but without a round in the chamber and see if your weapon discharges, if it does, or you're still worried, you can adjust the trigger pull weight."
09-08-2019T03:13:26,AspiringNoodle,"A decent, high quality gun won't discharge randomly"
09-08-2019T03:13:37,JeremySenpai,Bull shit
09-08-2019T03:13:38,SageSaga,and at that point- just equip your weapon to a security camera that identifies threats- at least then you didnt shoot XD
09-08-2019T03:13:57,JeremySenpai,there are too many factors that can cause accidental discharge
09-08-2019T03:14:04,JeremySenpai,in everyday life
09-08-2019T03:14:06,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Done that before Sage, laggy as shit"

09-08-2019T03:15:16,SageSaga,wasnt there a video of a guy showing off a gun and talked about how reliable it was and that you can drop it - and he did and it discharged?
09-08-2019T03:15:22,JeremySenpai,yep
09-08-2019T03:15:36,Dadrobit,Tell me it was a hi loint. Please

09-08-2019T03:15:48,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Thats why you don't buy a Sig Sauer
09-08-2019T03:15:48,ZRO4825,Hi Points are NOT considered top of the line guns. :P
09-08-2019T03:15:58,JeremySenpai,even a gun with a safety on can discharge if dropped
09-08-2019T03:16:00,Dadrobit,That was why I was asking.
09-08-2019T03:16:18,SageSaga,there was one where a police officer was showing gun safety in a classroom and accidentally discharged his weapon
09-08-2019T03:16:22,JeremySenpai,I actually was that at a live fire.
09-08-2019T03:16:29,Dadrobit,Though they did just release one of the greatest named firearms of all time.
09-08-2019T03:16:38,JeremySenpai,*saw that at a live fire
09-08-2019T03:16:51,MarvTheHugPharaoh,why did he have a round chambered in it?

09-08-2019T03:21:21,unsteddyphoenix,Hey nice work sage well streamed
09-08-2019T03:21:23,Dadrobit,:/ can't see. No stream visible on the app. Just got the chat and the radio on.
09-08-2019T03:21:30,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Fuck, sage you reminded me I need to learn how to paint Back Grounds"
09-08-2019T03:21:37,AspiringNoodle,Reading an article
09-08-2019T03:22:05,Dadrobit,Local station is hyped about Fear Innoculum. Tool songs every third song. Good stuff
09-08-2019T03:22:08,SageSaga,"I dont want to take your guns - I just want what we all agree on to happen - that universal background checks should be a thing, and that we should put effort into figuring out the causes of this bull crap"
09-08-2019T03:22:30,SageSaga,stop blaming stuff we know isnt the issue and focus on the issue- even if that means looking at guns
09-08-2019T03:22:40,AspiringNoodle,"For self-defense, the condition that balances safety with readiness is called ""Cocked And Locked"""
09-08-2019T03:23:27,SageSaga,werent there guns that if they were cocked it could still fire with the safety on?
09-08-2019T03:23:55,AspiringNoodle,I'm finishing up the article.  It varies from design to design
09-08-2019T03:24:00,MarvTheHugPharaoh,we call those Sig Sauers and we don't but those
09-08-2019T03:24:04,SageSaga,XD
09-08-2019T03:24:05,MarvTheHugPharaoh,buy*
09-08-2019T03:24:12,Dadrobit,Some shitty old ones can. Uzis and the like.
09-08-2019T03:24:25,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Thats why I'm a Beretta fan boy
09-08-2019T03:24:56,Dadrobit,"Glock and S&W for handguns, Mossberg 12 ga. for the house"
09-08-2019T03:25:20,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Dad, I have a S&W handgun and a Mossberg 12 ga XD"
09-08-2019T03:25:34,Dadrobit,Mossbuddy!
09-08-2019T03:25:37,SageSaga,"the point I want to make with the mental illness thing is- how we determine mental illness isnt just ""This person did something bad so they must be mentally ill"""
09-08-2019T03:25:37,AspiringNoodle,"So, I found what I was looking for"
09-08-2019T03:25:37,MarvTheHugPharaoh,\o/
09-08-2019T03:25:54,AspiringNoodle,1911's will NOT fire unless you pull the trigger
09-08-2019T03:25:55,SageSaga,most of these people know what they are doing when they do it- they arent mentally broken
09-08-2019T03:26:13,SageSaga,they arent sick
09-08-2019T03:27:20,SageSaga,I guess they would be classified as Radicals?
09-08-2019T03:27:31,AspiringNoodle,Correction: 1911's with Series 80 hammer-firing pins
09-08-2019T03:27:37,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"there have been some shooters who were showing signs on mental instability before they committed a shooting, I don't remember which one but he posted videos on him torturing animals on facebook"
09-08-2019T03:27:44,AspiringNoodle,^
09-08-2019T03:27:55,SageSaga,yeah but that isnt the majority
09-08-2019T03:27:56,AspiringNoodle,And there's a competitive element
09-08-2019T03:28:08,AspiringNoodle,Most of these shooters want to one up the shooters before them
09-08-2019T03:28:20,SageSaga,was that proven?
09-08-2019T03:28:35,SageSaga,"I know a few said things like ""Bigger than -"""
09-08-2019T03:28:48,SageSaga,but i dont know if thats been a running theme
09-08-2019T03:29:06,AspiringNoodle,I'm pretty sure this is what academics who are studying the phenomenon are concluding
09-08-2019T03:29:11,SageSaga,what are the general motives?
09-08-2019T03:29:19,SageSaga,i know some were Revenge
09-08-2019T03:29:27,Dadrobit,"The media glorification's like a scoreboard. The most eligible bachelor, cept they're not hunting spirits in neo yokio."
09-08-2019T03:29:33,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"That is a theory, thats why a few news outlets refuse to give the identity and motive of the shooter.  In case it can spark inspiration.  Not sure if its works but I get why"
09-08-2019T03:30:08,SageSaga,well the issue with that is we all need to do it to stop the spread but some people think we need to see their faces
09-08-2019T03:30:47,SageSaga,im all for not ever using their names or even specific events and their pictures
09-08-2019T03:31:05,SageSaga,but yeah we dont know if it works at all
09-08-2019T03:31:57,AspiringNoodle,"Tbh, at this point the way media covers mass shootings won't change.  It brings them ratings, and they are hurting for them bad"
09-08-2019T03:32:43,SageSaga,for News they need to ignore ratings
09-08-2019T03:32:44,JeremySenpai,Thanks for the whisipers noodle. I am well aware of the capabilties of certain weapons
09-08-2019T03:33:44,Dadrobit,"Alas, so long as the news is done for-profit..."
09-08-2019T03:33:54,AspiringNoodle,^
09-08-2019T03:34:13,AspiringNoodle,They abandoned integrity long ago
09-08-2019T03:34:17,SageSaga,yeah you are right- America needs to go socialist!
09-08-2019T03:34:28,MarvTheHugPharaoh,yang gang?
09-08-2019T03:34:37,SageSaga,<_< yeeeeeah thats gonna go worse than saying we need to get rid of guns XD
09-08-2019T03:34:43,Dadrobit,\o/ yang4prez
09-08-2019T03:34:48,AspiringNoodle,Full ANYTHING is bad
09-08-2019T03:35:00,SageSaga,it was a joke
09-08-2019T03:35:17,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Dude yang or Tulsi tbh.  If not them then bring me mad max
09-08-2019T03:35:23,AspiringNoodle,"Tbf, a lot of our policies are inspired by socialist ideas"
09-08-2019T03:35:30,Dadrobit,"Also, is Hang even still in the running?"
09-08-2019T03:35:37,Dadrobit,Yang*

09-08-2019T03:35:58,MarvTheHugPharaoh,duing better then when he started but still has a way to go
09-08-2019T03:35:59,Dadrobit,"I can bring you Mad Max, Marv."
09-08-2019T03:36:17,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Seen those pictures my dude, that shit looks hype"
09-08-2019T03:36:18,JeremySenpai,Later Sage.
09-08-2019T03:36:19,Dadrobit,Last I heard he was at like 2% support.

09-08-2019T03:36:57,SageSaga,like i said- my work was done
09-08-2019T03:37:38,Bgrmystr2,"you know.. it bothers me that picarto thinks your stream is broken instead of stopped.. so instead of going to the 'stream offline' page like tom's is, it just sits there and loads for goddamn ever."
09-08-2019T03:37:43,Bgrmystr2,"all night, even."
09-08-2019T03:37:48,Bgrmystr2,for weeks now.
09-08-2019T03:38:33,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Just found a poll that does not have Tulsi in it, I'm pissed"
09-08-2019T03:38:45,Dadrobit,Brb
09-08-2019T03:39:01,SageSaga,Yeah same thing happens to me but in reverse
09-08-2019T03:39:32,Bgrmystr2,"hmm, wonder if it's based on the user page you're on the site for."
09-08-2019T03:40:38,SageSaga,yep
09-08-2019T03:41:03,SageSaga,i talked to Picarto help and they havent replied to my reply... which upsets me somewhat

09-08-2019T03:56:52,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"tbh, 2.23 rounds are not really gonna do much against wild hogs.  Those turds are pretty tough"

09-08-2019T03:57:09,AspiringNoodle,"2.23, effective against humans, weak af in general"
09-08-2019T03:57:34,MarvTheHugPharaoh,the best varmint round there is.
09-08-2019T03:57:37,AspiringNoodle,Though it does depend on the size of the animal.  Squirrel? Overkill. Deer? Not legal.
09-08-2019T03:57:42,SageSaga,so are y'all familiar with the meme of number neigbors?
09-08-2019T03:57:53,AspiringNoodle,#Peak2019
09-08-2019T03:58:17,SageSaga,its where bored people text message the person the next number step away from them randomly...
09-08-2019T03:58:29,SageSaga,here is a combined meme from that - https://twitter.com/jackwweeks/status/1158540116480208897
09-08-2019T03:58:35,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Saw raccoon eggs get hit with a number neighbor.  Wew boy he did not make there day a good one XD
09-08-2019T03:58:42,AspiringNoodle,lmao
09-08-2019T03:59:26,Bgrmystr2,..wtf is a number neighbor
09-08-2019T03:59:34,AspiringNoodle,"""its where bored people text message the person the next number step away from them randomly..."""
09-08-2019T03:59:38,AspiringNoodle,"Sage literally just said that, lol"
09-08-2019T03:59:54,Bgrmystr2,yes but wtf does that even mean. next step away from what
09-08-2019T04:00:00,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"I want to get hit with a number neighbor, just so I can fuck with them."
09-08-2019T04:00:05,Bgrmystr2,could it be any more vague lol
09-08-2019T04:00:06,AspiringNoodle,If you're 999-9998
09-08-2019T04:00:09,MarvTheHugPharaoh,one digit up or down
09-08-2019T04:00:13,AspiringNoodle,Then you text either 999-9999 or 999-9997
09-08-2019T04:00:21,Bgrmystr2,"oh, that makes much more sense"
09-08-2019T04:01:00,Bgrmystr2,that'd prolly never work for me cuz I ignore everything that isn't registered previously.
09-08-2019T04:01:09,AspiringNoodle,Same
09-08-2019T04:01:18,AspiringNoodle,"More or less I don't answer my phone until I can verify the number, lol"
09-08-2019T04:01:39,AspiringNoodle,Though I may need to flip that :/
09-08-2019T04:01:45,SageSaga,they use text messaging so they dont have to actually talk to them
09-08-2019T04:01:58,SageSaga,also so they can screen cap it and share it with the internet
09-08-2019T04:02:03,SageSaga,because meme
09-08-2019T04:05:06,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"♪I will do anything for the meme, but i won't do that.♪"
09-08-2019T04:07:25,SageSaga,"""oh boy oh boy! A meme!"" ""Yeah all ya gotta do is talk to someone-"" ""NOPE!"""
09-08-2019T04:09:48,MarvTheHugPharaoh,You know you win the meme when you get someone from a government agency knocking on your door
09-08-2019T04:11:40,SageSaga,take care folks - im gonna do some other work and head to bed soon
09-08-2019T04:11:48,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nighty night sage o/
09-08-2019T04:12:04,AspiringNoodle,Night
09-08-2019T04:15:36,Dadrobit,Back. Had to talk to some upper management folks about the javelina incident earlier.
09-08-2019T04:15:47,MarvTheHugPharaoh,oofy
09-08-2019T04:17:00,Dadrobit,"On the one hand, ""that's not in your jurisdiction, you shouldn't have been there."" On the other, ""thanks for helping that dude and the cleaning ladies."""
09-08-2019T04:17:54,MarvTheHugPharaoh,so thanks but not thanks
09-08-2019T04:20:13,Dadrobit,"Eh, wasn't even a slap on the wrist. They were more thankful than anything. They were only mentioning that I was out of bounds purely because they had to. Otherwise they just wanted to make sure everyone was okay in the end."
09-08-2019T04:21:44,MarvTheHugPharaoh,thats a good
09-08-2019T04:22:22,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, even if it wasn't your juristiction, You were the one contacted. If you said ""Nope, not my job"" it just would have made you look bad"
09-08-2019T04:22:44,Bgrmystr2,so it's good that you went
09-08-2019T04:24:18,Dadrobit,"Yeah, there's no way they expected anyone not to go considering the contract location is literally INSIDE my own. But the ""alternative"" scenario is to call police and let them handle emergency situations outside of what I'm contracted to handle."
09-08-2019T04:25:54,Dadrobit,And unfortunately I didn't know it was a legitimate EMERGENCY when I was first called or else that would have been the call in addition to me hurrying my ass down there
09-08-2019T04:28:40,Dadrobit,"The cleaning ladies unfortunately don't speak perfect English, and I thought they were just out of sorts because they locked themselves in a supply shed away from some javelinas, had no idea the guard was injured."
09-08-2019T04:29:40,Bgrmystr2,"well shit, I expect the emergency call went out immediately on seeing him"
09-08-2019T04:30:13,Dadrobit,"Yeah, that was a fast 911"
09-08-2019T04:30:30,Bgrmystr2,"""Well SHIT, there goes the next 3 hours"" - Dadro probably"
09-08-2019T04:30:40,Bgrmystr2,I hope he's okay tho
09-08-2019T04:30:44,Dadrobit,Am a bit irritated the ladies didn't call 911 themselves though.
09-08-2019T04:30:50,Bgrmystr2,yeah
09-08-2019T04:30:52,Dadrobit,"Lol, yeah."
09-08-2019T04:30:57,Bgrmystr2,that's a problem in and of itself
09-08-2019T04:31:43,Dadrobit,"And yeah, I hope he makes a good recovery. He's a good guy, known him for over 5 years now."
09-08-2019T04:32:34,Dadrobit,"He's a bit slow, but he gets there. Just a guy trying to get through the last few years til retirement."
09-08-2019T04:35:17,Dadrobit,"He's honestly kind of fascinating to talk to. It's not that he's super dumb or anything, he's just literally slow. Like you can hold a conversation with him on anything, but his responses are all just delayed by a few seconds. It's almost like the sloths"

09-08-2019T09:39:55,AspiringNoodle,That poor manager.  He's a good example of why 24 hour businesses that aren't essential services are just a poor idea.
09-08-2019T09:40:13,AspiringNoodle,Been up since 5 am yesterday and is on his third shift.  His second shift was an overnight.
09-08-2019T09:43:37,CrimsonQuill,I finally finished colouring my first proper OC reference sheet.
09-08-2019T09:43:49,CrimsonQuill,I'm adding the text in using the text tool on Paint.
09-08-2019T09:43:58,CrimsonQuill,My handwriting is too messy.
09-08-2019T09:44:15,SniperJackal,"cool, you can show it if you want when you re done"
09-08-2019T09:44:18,CrimsonQuill,"I'm taking a lot of inspiration from Tom's sheets, while adding my own bits and bobs."
09-08-2019T09:44:42,CrimsonQuill,@SniperJackal I'm going to upload them to my Deviantart account once they're ready.
09-08-2019T09:44:49,CrimsonQuill,I have a whole Halo fanon storyline in my head
09-08-2019T09:45:05,SniperJackal,Oh yeah you have a deviantart account
09-08-2019T09:45:09,SniperJackal,gonna check it out later
09-08-2019T09:45:22,CrimsonQuill,"OC Bailey and OC Adams are Ex-UNSC Marines, and Twokinds guest Raine is Ex-ODST"
09-08-2019T09:45:34,CrimsonQuill,(If Tom is ok with me taking her on crazy Halo adventures)
09-08-2019T09:45:40,SniperJackal,Meanwhile im here HOPING that some news comes for Halo Reach PC at gamescom
09-08-2019T09:45:46,CrimsonQuill,Me too.
09-08-2019T09:45:57,SniperJackal,and the new need for speed
09-08-2019T09:46:11,CrimsonQuill,I've been playing a lot of Reach with my brother
09-08-2019T09:46:15,CrimsonQuill,Gruntpocalypse
09-08-2019T09:46:22,SniperJackal,backward compatibility on xone?
09-08-2019T09:46:29,CrimsonQuill,"THe only Halo game I have played are 4, ODST and Reach"
09-08-2019T09:46:32,CrimsonQuill,X360
09-08-2019T09:46:36,CrimsonQuill,I don't have an XONdd
09-08-2019T09:46:38,CrimsonQuill,One
09-08-2019T09:46:56,SniperJackal,oh still have a 360 nice
09-08-2019T09:46:57,CrimsonQuill,The 360 used to be my dad's till he said it was the family's
09-08-2019T09:47:02,SniperJackal,cool
09-08-2019T09:47:11,CrimsonQuill,I didn't even learn of Halo till two years ago now
09-08-2019T09:47:12,SniperJackal,tho you should really play halo 1-3
09-08-2019T09:47:16,CrimsonQuill,Picked up Halo 4 in the shop
09-08-2019T09:47:29,CrimsonQuill,I have seen the cutscenes of Halo 1-3
09-08-2019T09:48:10,CrimsonQuill,And SPV3 and CE (at my friend's house) showed me the sheer beauty of the gameplay (though graphics still leave something to be desired)
09-08-2019T09:48:12,SniperJackal,oh ok
09-08-2019T09:48:21,SniperJackal,yeah the problem is
09-08-2019T09:48:28,CrimsonQuill,I think 4 has my favourite story
09-08-2019T09:48:37,SniperJackal,halo 1 on the original xbox has better graphics than the ports
09-08-2019T09:48:43,CrimsonQuill,"Or at least, as far as the Chief-Cortana dynamic goes"
09-08-2019T09:48:48,CrimsonQuill,@SniperJackal I know
09-08-2019T09:48:50,SniperJackal,but the devs said they re gonna fix it
09-08-2019T09:48:51,CrimsonQuill,My friend told me
09-08-2019T09:49:13,SniperJackal,halo 4 is great in terms of storyyeah
09-08-2019T09:49:15,CrimsonQuill,I compared it by watching the RvB Original episodes of seasons 1 and 2 and comparing them to the 'remastered' episodes
09-08-2019T09:49:32,CrimsonQuill,@SniperJackal the things that I would change in 4 are the Didact thing
09-08-2019T09:49:46,CrimsonQuill,But I love the Spartan IVs as a concept and idea
09-08-2019T09:49:55,CrimsonQuill,And some of their armour is badass
09-08-2019T09:49:58,SniperJackal,yeah he didnt appear much
09-08-2019T09:50:02,CrimsonQuill,"Recruit, Warrior, Air Assault..."
09-08-2019T09:50:04,CrimsonQuill,:)
09-08-2019T09:50:30,SniperJackal,Im still dissapointed how they brought back cortana
09-08-2019T09:50:42,SniperJackal,"I wish they left her, well dead?"
09-08-2019T09:50:49,SniperJackal,So we could move on
09-08-2019T09:51:25,CrimsonQuill,That hit me in the gut when I watched the H5 cutscenes.
09-08-2019T09:51:34,CrimsonQuill,At least their trying to fiz it in Infinite
09-08-2019T09:52:02,SniperJackal,yeah
09-08-2019T09:52:35,CrimsonQuill,I love the Master Chief in Halo 4
09-08-2019T09:52:43,CrimsonQuill,He looks like a walking tank
09-08-2019T09:52:54,CrimsonQuill,Infinite is my favourite MC armour
09-08-2019T09:53:05,CrimsonQuill,Bacause it combines the best of both.
09-08-2019T09:53:14,CrimsonQuill,Bungie and 343.
09-08-2019T09:53:30,CrimsonQuill,And it includes cues from that armour in 'Forward unto Dawn'.
09-08-2019T09:55:09,SniperJackal,and the 117 text from halo legends the package
09-08-2019T09:55:40,CrimsonQuill,Yes.
09-08-2019T09:56:03,SniperJackal,still prefer the mk V armor :3
09-08-2019T09:57:46,CrimsonQuill,That one's good
09-08-2019T09:57:59,CrimsonQuill,TekkaCroe on Deviantart made a great drawing of it
09-08-2019T09:58:20,CrimsonQuill,(And corrected the mistakes Airborn Studios made in the Halo 5 build)
09-08-2019T09:59:24,SniperJackal,"oh I looked the tekkacroe one, look sick"
09-08-2019T09:59:34,CrimsonQuill,Ooh nice
09-08-2019T09:59:48,CrimsonQuill,I do have a problem though
09-08-2019T09:59:59,CrimsonQuill,I have only seven sheets of paper left in my main sketchpad
09-08-2019T10:00:17,CrimsonQuill,"It's enough to do the other four pages of reference sheeting, buuut...."
09-08-2019T10:00:28,CrimsonQuill,I intend to start my fanon comic after that.
09-08-2019T10:00:40,CrimsonQuill,My other sketchbook might do
09-08-2019T10:00:50,CrimsonQuill,But I'd have to take the sheets out
09-08-2019T10:00:55,CrimsonQuill,As it is not ring-bound
09-08-2019T10:01:02,CrimsonQuill,And that makes drawing a bit harder
09-08-2019T10:02:04,SniperJackal,I usually just take a piece of paper from a paper stack that I have somewhere
09-08-2019T10:03:18,CrimsonQuill,Not what I really go for
09-08-2019T10:03:39,SniperJackal,yeah its not very
09-08-2019T10:03:42,SniperJackal,efficient
09-08-2019T10:04:07,SniperJackal,and storing it is a mess
09-08-2019T10:04:14,AspiringNoodle,The bright side of digital
09-08-2019T10:04:18,AspiringNoodle,Almost endless storage
09-08-2019T10:04:28,AspiringNoodle,Downside?  You can lose everything at once xD
09-08-2019T10:04:31,CrimsonQuill,I like holding the paper
09-08-2019T10:05:54,SniperJackal,but I dont draw much
09-08-2019T10:05:59,SniperJackal,so its like meh
09-08-2019T10:06:05,CrimsonQuill,I'm practicing
09-08-2019T10:06:16,SniperJackal,the last thing I tried to draw was a halo 2/3 marine
09-08-2019T10:06:17,CrimsonQuill,I'm getting better at proportions...for men at least
09-08-2019T10:06:25,CrimsonQuill,Women are a chellenge
09-08-2019T10:06:27,CrimsonQuill,And fingers
09-08-2019T10:06:29,CrimsonQuill,FINGERS
09-08-2019T10:06:30,SniperJackal,couple of tries and it sort of worked?
09-08-2019T10:06:50,SniperJackal,fingers are a bitch
09-08-2019T10:07:04,CrimsonQuill,I actually did an art trae with a guy named ArchAngel470...
09-08-2019T10:07:04,SniperJackal,drawing mittens would make it easier
09-08-2019T10:07:17,CrimsonQuill,I did it and uploaded it...buuut.....
09-08-2019T10:07:23,CrimsonQuill,"It looked off, and rushed."
09-08-2019T10:07:32,CrimsonQuill,So I redrew the whole blooming thing over a week.
09-08-2019T10:07:34,CrimsonQuill,Worth it.
09-08-2019T10:07:41,CrimsonQuill,And I stuck in Adams and Raine as well.
09-08-2019T10:07:52,CrimsonQuill,My first proper drawing of her-I think it was ok. :)
09-08-2019T10:08:17,SniperJackal,do you use any techniques? Usually I just draw howere I feel like
09-08-2019T10:08:24,SniperJackal,dont really have any
09-08-2019T10:08:31,CrimsonQuill,Ummm...I wouldn't say techniques
09-08-2019T10:08:43,CrimsonQuill,I just spent a lot of time sketching
09-08-2019T10:08:52,CrimsonQuill,(The Centurion chestpiece was a NIGHTMARE)
09-08-2019T10:08:56,SniperJackal,yeah that probably helps
09-08-2019T10:09:09,CrimsonQuill,And then started the final thing (more sketching)
09-08-2019T10:09:15,CrimsonQuill,"Went over it in pen, coloured it"
09-08-2019T10:09:24,CrimsonQuill,I used a ruler for the holotable and racks
09-08-2019T10:09:59,CrimsonQuill,I deleted the first version
09-08-2019T10:10:01,SniperJackal,I do kinda use Tom s style of eyes
09-08-2019T10:10:10,CrimsonQuill,Tom's style is a big influence
09-08-2019T10:10:48,SniperJackal,looks good
09-08-2019T10:10:51,CrimsonQuill,"The biggest comics of my life have been Calvin and Hobbes, Asterix and Twokinds"
09-08-2019T10:10:52,CrimsonQuill,Thanks
09-08-2019T10:11:01,CrimsonQuill,Wait till you see his finalised armour
09-08-2019T10:11:24,CrimsonQuill,"EOD Helmet, MK VI arms and legs and Centurion chestplate (with a bit of modification)"
09-08-2019T10:11:26,CrimsonQuill,Brb
09-08-2019T10:11:30,CrimsonQuill,Have to feed dogs
09-08-2019T10:16:11,CrimsonQuill,Back
09-08-2019T10:46:38,AspiringNoodle,Can't wait to take a nap later today xD
09-08-2019T10:46:45,CrimsonQuill,:)
09-08-2019T11:09:37,SniperJackal,naps are the best thing ever
09-08-2019T11:09:53,CrimsonQuill,Don't forget Food time
09-08-2019T11:10:00,CrimsonQuill,Or Food Nap time-the best time of all!
09-08-2019T11:10:08,SniperJackal,:O
09-08-2019T11:10:45,CrimsonQuill,"God Dammit, Caboose on the brain"
09-08-2019T11:13:35,SniperJackal,but usually when I say naps
09-08-2019T11:13:50,SniperJackal,I mean going to sleep in the afternoon for a few hours
09-08-2019T11:14:00,SniperJackal,not really naps
09-08-2019T11:14:28,CrimsonQuill,I can only sleep at the end of the day
09-08-2019T11:14:31,CrimsonQuill,I am unable to nap
09-08-2019T11:15:27,SniperJackal,Usually im mentally exhausted from school and I just need some quiet time
09-08-2019T11:15:48,SniperJackal,in the afternoon
09-08-2019T11:17:21,AspiringNoodle,I need to reestablish my sleep schedule before I reenter that fun period from weeks ago when I had to sleep twice a day for shorter periods

09-08-2019T13:19:04,IronHorseComics,and a Tom AND Sage are in ze chat
09-08-2019T13:19:10,IronHorseComics,probably bored
09-08-2019T13:19:19,IronHorseComics,or distracted
09-08-2019T13:19:20,TeapotOfDoom,so his idea was to call it pulling a reni which is quite fitting imo
09-08-2019T13:19:32,TeapotOfDoom,Hi Iron!

09-08-2019T13:37:37,TeapotOfDoom,Power outage?
09-08-2019T13:37:47,Twokinds,Lost power yesterday
09-08-2019T13:37:48,CrimsonQuill,Hey Tom
09-08-2019T13:37:55,Twokinds,And it really set my schedule back

09-08-2019T13:37:56,TeapotOfDoom,Oh damn
09-08-2019T13:38:04,TeapotOfDoom,Lost any work?
09-08-2019T13:38:18,Twokinds,No.
09-08-2019T13:38:27,CrimsonQuill,Thank goodness.
09-08-2019T13:38:35,TeapotOfDoom,How long did it last?
09-08-2019T13:38:35,Twokinds,"My computer has a backup power supply, so it doesn't go out when the power does."
09-08-2019T13:38:50,Twokinds,But it's only long enough to save work and turn things off. It can't run for more than 20 min.
09-08-2019T13:38:56,TeapotOfDoom,Oh nice you're more prepared then our server room...
09-08-2019T13:39:10,Azumachan,UPS are handy
09-08-2019T13:39:20,CrimsonQuill,That's a decent contingency plan.
09-08-2019T13:39:25,CrimsonQuill,o/ Azuma
09-08-2019T13:39:32,TeapotOfDoom,Hi Azuma

09-08-2019T13:40:12,TeapotOfDoom,So how bad's the setback?
09-08-2019T13:40:39,Twokinds,Well the comic should have been out by now
09-08-2019T13:40:42,Azumachan,Hey.
09-08-2019T13:40:47,Twokinds,I have to do it today now
09-08-2019T13:41:00,Twokinds,And I don't have today's sketch done now
09-08-2019T13:41:18,TerraTheWizard,oof
09-08-2019T13:41:48,Azumachan,"That's rough, I'm sorry."

09-08-2019T13:41:50,SniperJackal,shit happens
09-08-2019T13:42:32,CrimsonQuill,Please don't push yourself too much Tom.

09-08-2019T13:44:20,SniperJackal,Yup never force yourself to do something
09-08-2019T13:45:26,TeapotOfDoom,Can't force creativity that's for sure
09-08-2019T13:45:40,TeapotOfDoom,Also i doubt people would be mad if you skipped one
09-08-2019T13:46:14,TeapotOfDoom,Anyway I'm off to dinner

09-08-2019T13:47:18,TeapotOfDoom,Also i just noticed we're seriously missing an omnom kinda emote xD
09-08-2019T13:47:24,CrimsonQuill,XD

09-08-2019T14:02:16,ZRO4825,$300 fine. Dozing off during streams is illegal! '.'/
09-08-2019T14:02:28,SageSaga,that runs counter to what i just said!
09-08-2019T14:02:31,RimaDraws,hey i had to take care of my nana
09-08-2019T14:02:33,SageSaga,one of us must be LYING

09-08-2019T14:02:56,RimaDraws,hi guys
09-08-2019T14:03:00,ZRO4825,"I, being a non-owner of this stream, would NEVER lie about such a thing! :csagesaga-nynasmirk:"
09-08-2019T14:03:02,RimaDraws,and she is alright but her hip hurts
09-08-2019T14:03:09,CrimsonQuill,Ok.

09-08-2019T14:03:20,RimaDraws,neither of them can get out of the house
09-08-2019T14:03:47,RimaDraws,and when i got back she did my laundry for me and i feel bad
09-08-2019T14:04:26,CrimsonQuill,...
09-08-2019T14:04:44,RimaDraws,i had to start my podcast this morning.

09-08-2019T14:05:06,RimaDraws,yea i am starting a podcasting series. for a little bit of everything
09-08-2019T14:05:11,RimaDraws,different categories
09-08-2019T14:05:36,CrimsonQuill,Ok
09-08-2019T14:05:57,RimaDraws,and dont laugh at me.....my first one is over the fnaf series
09-08-2019T14:06:10,RimaDraws,like please i am just an amateur
09-08-2019T14:06:18,CrimsonQuill,I like FnAF.
09-08-2019T14:06:49,RimaDraws,i just want a purpose for my youtube channel
09-08-2019T14:07:26,IronHorseComics,I personally think it jumped the shark with FNAF4
09-08-2019T14:07:37,RimaDraws,well they got a new game coming out soon
09-08-2019T14:07:43,IronHorseComics,at least he TRIED to make it work so that's nice
09-08-2019T14:07:45,RimaDraws,and it looks different
09-08-2019T14:08:35,RimaDraws,which this is no surprise
09-08-2019T14:08:41,IronHorseComics,"hmmm, looks very... late 90s"
09-08-2019T14:08:45,RimaDraws,it does
09-08-2019T14:08:49,RimaDraws,i almost guess 80s
09-08-2019T14:08:58,RimaDraws,but i dont think lazer tag was in the 80s
09-08-2019T14:09:08,ZRO4825,It was.
09-08-2019T14:09:10,SageSaga,i was part of a podcast
09-08-2019T14:09:14,ZRO4825,I remember having lazer tag guns as a kid.
09-08-2019T14:09:21,CrimsonQuill,What sort Sage?
09-08-2019T14:09:25,ZRO4825,"It wasn't GREAT, but it was Lazer Tag."
09-08-2019T14:09:31,RimaDraws,what podcast sage?
09-08-2019T14:09:31,SageSaga,Geek News and Games
09-08-2019T14:09:34,RimaDraws,oh cool
09-08-2019T14:09:36,IronHorseComics,"I tried to do a let's play channel, it did not pan out"
09-08-2019T14:09:40,CrimsonQuill,figures
09-08-2019T14:09:41,RimaDraws,same iron
09-08-2019T14:09:47,RimaDraws,but i want to try this out and see where it goes
09-08-2019T14:09:53,IronHorseComics,mainly because editing took forever
09-08-2019T14:10:09,ZRO4825,"I keep debating trying to do a Let's Play channel, except voicing it as Abe from the Oddworld games."
09-08-2019T14:10:13,IronHorseComics,"Hey, here's a thought, you could talk about webcomic news"
09-08-2019T14:10:34,RimaDraws,i would love to talk about AI and Twokinds but i may need tom and sage's approval
09-08-2019T14:10:48,RimaDraws,i wanted to do that but i was iffy
09-08-2019T14:10:54,IronHorseComics,"maybe a bit too niche but you could have it as something to do once a month, depending on your schedule"
09-08-2019T14:11:06,RimaDraws,i do my podcasting on saturdays since i am off
09-08-2019T14:11:19,CrimsonQuill,How many podcasts so far Rima?
09-08-2019T14:11:55,RimaDraws,uh just one particular episode
09-08-2019T14:11:57,SageSaga,"it was called - uhhh ""We Play RPGs"""
09-08-2019T14:12:21,CrimsonQuill,Ok
09-08-2019T14:12:31,SageSaga,there goes that weird connection error to Picarto

09-08-2019T14:14:27,RimaDraws,yw
09-08-2019T14:14:56,SageSaga,one of the people who worked with us on the Podcast recently took over all the old stuff and turned it into his own thing :P
09-08-2019T14:15:05,SageSaga,unfortunately- he is an idiot
09-08-2019T14:15:07,RimaDraws,oh wow
09-08-2019T14:15:36,SageSaga,"its now filled with his bad artwork- I can say that because I offered some help and he said ""Nah man- this is my style"""
09-08-2019T14:15:45,SageSaga,so his style is bad art
09-08-2019T14:15:45,BadFoMo,Back. What did I miss?
09-08-2019T14:15:54,CrimsonQuill,Oh dear
09-08-2019T14:15:57,CrimsonQuill,Hello BadFoMo
09-08-2019T14:16:03,RimaDraws,i have bad art lol
09-08-2019T14:16:11,IronHorseComics,"speaking of comic, I think I should wait a week to upload, I'm on the last four pages of the chapter and I would like to get them out in at least two weeks rather than four"
09-08-2019T14:16:13,RimaDraws,hi badfomo
09-08-2019T14:16:39,BadFoMo,I can make bad art-ish... things.
09-08-2019T14:16:41,IronHorseComics,"your art ain't that bad Rima, a lot better than a lot of other artists I see"
09-08-2019T14:16:42,SageSaga,you dont hand wave criticism by saying its just your style though- which means you still have hope at improving
09-08-2019T14:16:45,CrimsonQuill,@RimaDraws you also have good art-like that Maddie Headshot
09-08-2019T14:16:56,CrimsonQuill,My art is still evolving
09-08-2019T14:16:59,SageSaga,yeah and your art isnt that bad- you just gotta keep working
09-08-2019T14:17:03,CrimsonQuill,I'm getting better with proportions
09-08-2019T14:17:11,CrimsonQuill,But I need to work on shading and hands
09-08-2019T14:17:13,RimaDraws,yea but my stuff is average
09-08-2019T14:17:18,CrimsonQuill,And I can;t really draw women
09-08-2019T14:17:19,Tharkis,:ctharkis-earwiggle:
09-08-2019T14:17:23,SageSaga,this guys drawings look like my stuff from age 8
09-08-2019T14:17:24,CrimsonQuill,Hiya Tharkis
09-08-2019T14:17:29,RimaDraws,ew damn
09-08-2019T14:17:29,IronHorseComics,I'd take average over bad any day
09-08-2019T14:17:39,MoonDance,Some people don't like to hear critique. They think it's bashing
09-08-2019T14:17:48,RimaDraws,yea i look at my old art like when i started digital 8 years ago
09-08-2019T14:17:53,RimaDraws,amg the cringe
09-08-2019T14:18:07,CrimsonQuill,I redrew an entire art trade because I couldn't bear how rushed it was
09-08-2019T14:19:02,RimaDraws,i hate when i feel rushed
09-08-2019T14:19:15,CrimsonQuill,I lost patience the first time
09-08-2019T14:19:16,CrimsonQuill,It cost
09-08-2019T14:19:25,CrimsonQuill,So I redid it
09-08-2019T14:19:28,CrimsonQuill,Zero regrest
09-08-2019T14:19:43,Ordithus,:csagesaga-nynasmirk: Hello!
09-08-2019T14:19:47,Twokinds,That's my secret - I'm always rushed
09-08-2019T14:19:52,CrimsonQuill,Hi Ordithus
09-08-2019T14:19:55,RimaDraws,i am too but i hate it

09-08-2019T14:20:17,RimaDraws,hi tom
09-08-2019T14:20:20,CrimsonQuill,@Twokinds I want to get to that stage
09-08-2019T14:20:27,IronHorseComics,"okay, so to start with Rima, what you could do is write your podcast ahead of time, a full script if you have to, and rehearse on your free time it until recording day, that way you can iron out any kinks and work on your timing"
09-08-2019T14:20:29,CrimsonQuill,Where I can create something of that calibre on the fly
09-08-2019T14:20:46,RimaDraws,yea i already got that from the bf iron
09-08-2019T14:21:02,IronHorseComics,I used to do stage acting and I had to do a lot of rehearsing before I would go on stage
09-08-2019T14:21:03,RimaDraws,because of how rushed i felt this week and busy i had no time
09-08-2019T14:21:09,Ordithus,Last week's page sure looks great :ctwokinds-keith8D:
09-08-2019T14:21:11,IronHorseComics,that's fair
09-08-2019T14:21:26,RimaDraws,but this week i will write ahead of time and rehearse it
09-08-2019T14:21:42,IronHorseComics,what's your subject this week?
09-08-2019T14:22:38,RimaDraws,ah well for next week i am going to be covering the first game entirely. so i may need to do research
09-08-2019T14:22:43,RimaDraws,i mean ive played the game
09-08-2019T14:22:48,RimaDraws,just need to be prepared
09-08-2019T14:22:56,Twokinds,Main screen turn on
09-08-2019T14:22:57,CrimsonQuill,I'd also add a few different images on slideshow
09-08-2019T14:23:07,SageSaga,the old podcast might be on iTunes
09-08-2019T14:23:17,RimaDraws,i will look it up sage
09-08-2019T14:23:24,CrimsonQuill,"Oh, stream"
09-08-2019T14:23:45,CrimsonQuill,I forgot you said you had a power outage
09-08-2019T14:23:46,BadFoMo,From Tom?
09-08-2019T14:23:54,IronHorseComics,"well, there's Matpat. There was a guy back in the day (forget his name) who literally had a video that was 10 facts about the cupcake"
09-08-2019T14:23:55,Zakuru,woo hoo!
09-08-2019T14:23:57,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-KatDance: ah Tom has power
09-08-2019T14:24:04,CrimsonQuill,@BadFoMo Tom has to finish the page today because of a power outage last night apparrently
09-08-2019T14:24:10,CrimsonQuill,Not that I knew
09-08-2019T14:24:12,IronHorseComics,I think he removed some of his videos though
09-08-2019T14:24:14,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-nibsbdaydance:
09-08-2019T14:24:19,CrimsonQuill,I was reading Trace smashing the fireballs together
09-08-2019T14:24:28,CrimsonQuill,"Anyhow, I'm going to say goodnight."
09-08-2019T14:24:30,RimaDraws,hey sage is it a dnd dice on the image?

09-08-2019T14:25:31,SageSaga,"Oh we had 2 different names for the podcast- the Geek show was called ""We Talk to Ourselves"" and the game was ""We Play RPGs"""
09-08-2019T14:25:54,IronHorseComics,"""We Talk to Ourselves"" XD"
09-08-2019T14:25:57,IronHorseComics,I love it
09-08-2019T14:25:58,SageSaga,i think one of those games includes me running away while the party gets murdered
09-08-2019T14:26:07,RimaDraws,i cant find we talk to ourselves
09-08-2019T14:26:16,Char89TheCharizard,wow its been a long time since I've last been on this stream

09-08-2019T14:28:55,SageSaga,ha found the old blog spot page for We Talk To Ourselves Podcast https://wetalktoourselves.blogspot.com/
09-08-2019T14:28:59,SageSaga,no clue if the links work
09-08-2019T14:30:58,IronHorseComics,"a couple people you could listen to for learning delivery is the original narrator for Bedtime Stories (the youtube channel about creepy stuff), Linkara, uuhhhh Mr Nightmare maybe, oh who else? OH! The Mighty Jingles"
09-08-2019T14:31:08,NezumiYuki,"Hey everyone!    side note~  Glad power is restored, Tom!  That was a rather rude surprise for everyone!"
09-08-2019T14:31:10,IronHorseComics,"and yes, they do Sage"
09-08-2019T14:31:44,Mikemkke034,Heyo

09-08-2019T14:31:51,Twokinds,Yeah
09-08-2019T14:32:01,Twokinds,It was apparently a pretty big blackout
09-08-2019T14:32:07,NezumiYuki,Geez!
09-08-2019T14:32:17,Twokinds,"Not huge, but they said it affected 1500 homes"

09-08-2019T14:32:27,IronHorseComics,ouch

09-08-2019T14:32:42,Twokinds,"No, no storm."
09-08-2019T14:32:51,Twokinds,Something must have gone wrong. Maybe a car crash or something.
09-08-2019T14:33:05,TerraTheWizard,wow
09-08-2019T14:33:06,MoonDance,It be like that sometimes

09-08-2019T14:33:40,Twokinds,Cincinnati
09-08-2019T14:33:51,SageSaga,one time we lost power for over an hour- turned out a kid drove his go kart under some high power lines and he had a giant metal flag on the back- kid got fried
09-08-2019T14:34:07,Ordithus,Wow
09-08-2019T14:34:09,Char89TheCharizard,Well I'm glad you guys got power back. I bet Mark was upset that he couldn't stream on Youtube

09-08-2019T14:42:56,IronHorseComics,"go to Dayton, there's the US Air Force museum there and it is amazing, better than the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum"
09-08-2019T14:43:37,Char89TheCharizard,"i've heard of Dayton, there used to be an old NFL team there back in the early 1900s"
09-08-2019T14:43:54,Char89TheCharizard,in fact I think the NFL was founded there
09-08-2019T14:44:01,MoonDance,I go to downtown Columbus. It's pretty nice at night and the con in the summer is popular
09-08-2019T14:44:02,FoxxTrotter,"Never been there myself, but I've heard of the place. The 'Memphis Belle' is on display there."
09-08-2019T14:44:30,Char89TheCharizard,"Memphis Belle? wait a minute, Memphis is in Tennesse"

09-08-2019T14:46:03,Muddy,Hehe.. I like how Nibs is taking shelter in the nook of Sythe's clothing.
09-08-2019T14:46:11,Char89TheCharizard,I'm not a fan of war related stuff.
09-08-2019T14:46:13,FoxxTrotter,"There is also one called the 'Movie Memphis Belle', which was used in the movie from back in the 1980's. It's currently in Geneseo, NY for display and flights."
09-08-2019T14:46:23,BadFoMo,Maddie: Nakid Boys! 3 of them!
09-08-2019T14:46:34,Char89TheCharizard,I mean its great for history but I don't want to be in an active battlefield
09-08-2019T14:46:58,FoxxTrotter,"The 'Enola Gay' is at the museum in D.C., the one that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima."

09-08-2019T14:48:16,FoxxTrotter,Owned by the Smithsonian.
09-08-2019T14:48:20,FoxxTrotter,"Hi, w0lf."
09-08-2019T14:48:51,IronHorseComics,"you get to go in a B-52 at the one in Dayton, you never realize how big those things are until you come close to it"
09-08-2019T14:49:03,Char89TheCharizard,I have been to previous battlefields before. Back in June I got to check out the old fort in St. Augustine
09-08-2019T14:49:04,Corinthian,Yo
09-08-2019T14:49:09,IronHorseComics,"er, not in one, close to one"
09-08-2019T14:49:10,BadFoMo,Yo.
09-08-2019T14:49:29,FoxxTrotter,"Bockscar, which dropped the atomic bomb on Nagasaki, is at the museum in Dayton."
09-08-2019T14:49:47,Muddy,I'd love to see the Columbia (Apollo 11's capsule) currently in Seattle.  It's the last stop on a national tour.
09-08-2019T14:49:55,Sclimshady,The Avenger dive bomber is deceptively enormous
09-08-2019T14:50:33,Muddy,BTW I wonder how radioactive BoxCar and Enola-Gay still are?
09-08-2019T14:50:43,Char89TheCharizard,I remember back in elementary school I went on a field trip to Cape Canaveral
09-08-2019T14:50:56,FoxxTrotter,I expect not at all if they are in museums.
09-08-2019T14:51:18,Muddy,"Last time I was at Cape Canaveral was in 2016, when I was in Orlando for Megaplex."
09-08-2019T14:51:31,Muddy,That tour was worth every penny!
09-08-2019T14:51:37,BadFoMo,Is ground zero safe-ish yet?
09-08-2019T14:51:59,IronHorseComics,"years ago we went to the NASA museum in Huntsville, AL. I don't remember much but I do remember seeing the Enterprise (the Space Shuttle prototype), an SR-71 blackbird. I wish I could remember more though"
09-08-2019T14:52:03,Muddy,"If you mean, Trinity?  I think so... for short visits."
09-08-2019T14:52:06,Char89TheCharizard,"Have you been to Gettysburg, one of the battle sites for the Civil War?"
09-08-2019T14:52:22,FoxxTrotter,"I've been to the NASA museum in Huntsville before, but it was over 20 years ago."
09-08-2019T14:52:37,Muddy,I remember the roll out of shuttle Enterprise on TV.
09-08-2019T14:52:54,FoxxTrotter,"Yes, I've been to Gettysburg...but not the battlefield."
09-08-2019T14:52:54,IronHorseComics,"I live near Chickamauga and Lookout Mountain, seeing Civil War stuff is nothing new to me"
09-08-2019T14:53:03,Muddy,You ever see the Saturn V at Florida?
09-08-2019T14:53:11,SageSaga,"ive been to Gettysburg, got to hear ghost stories in a basement"
09-08-2019T14:53:18,BadFoMo,I ment Nagosaki and Heroshima (I think I butchered thoes names).
09-08-2019T14:53:18,Char89TheCharizard,Well I remember dad show me Gettysburg. I have an ancestor who fought there
09-08-2019T14:53:21,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-florajiggle:
09-08-2019T14:53:52,FoxxTrotter,"For the most part, FoMo, since both cities have been rebuilt."

09-08-2019T14:54:19,Ordithus,That panel alone has so many good expressions
09-08-2019T14:54:26,SageSaga,Hiroshima
09-08-2019T14:54:38,FoxxTrotter,Most of the recent radiation in Japan would be from the Fukushima nuclear plant meltdown.
09-08-2019T14:54:45,Muddy,I had a great grandfather (Mom's family) that was a Union officer. Can't recall where he fought thought.
09-08-2019T14:54:58,SageSaga,Nagasaki i think is how the other is spelled
09-08-2019T14:54:59,IronHorseComics,and yet it was still nowhere near as bad as Chernobyl
09-08-2019T14:55:14,BadFoMo,Only off by one letter?! I am impresed with myself.
09-08-2019T14:55:38,Muddy,"Just know he was badly wounded, recovered to a point, then died young enough that my grandmother, and her sister ended up in an orphanage."
09-08-2019T14:56:22,Muddy,"And, yes... he did father my grandmother rather late in life after the Civil War."
09-08-2019T14:56:27,Char89TheCharizard,This is the ancestor I mentioned https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_McCandless
09-08-2019T14:57:17,Char89TheCharizard,"And yes, McCandless is my last name, I rarely mentioned this to anyone"
09-08-2019T14:58:20,Char89TheCharizard,"And before you ask Foxx, yes I have a relative who's been in space. Bruce McCandless II"
09-08-2019T14:58:32,Char89TheCharizard,he was a distant relative
09-08-2019T14:59:36,FoxxTrotter,"I've heard of the name before, yes."
09-08-2019T14:59:46,IronHorseComics,I would state my ancestor but i don't wanna be doxxed by some SJW I trigger
09-08-2019T15:00:09,IronHorseComics,"he wasn't a clan member or anything, he was just someone who knew General Lee"
09-08-2019T15:00:38,SageSaga,darn - i thought you were going to talk about your strong German background from the 1930s
09-08-2019T15:00:44,FoxxTrotter,I'm just something I'm actually not. My 2nd great grandfather was adopted. XP
09-08-2019T15:01:20,SageSaga,oh yeah? We'll im made from exploded star material
09-08-2019T15:01:29,IronHorseComics,well I say knew... he was one of General Lee's personal physicians
09-08-2019T15:02:12,FoxxTrotter,More talking about surnames and not the Big Bang. ;0P
09-08-2019T15:02:14,NezumiYuki,Sage..... We're ALL made from dead star material!  xDD
09-08-2019T15:02:21,SageSaga,that is the joke
09-08-2019T15:02:26,IronHorseComics,"I can't remember his name for the life of me but I do remember once seeing his grave, it wasn't too far off from where my grandmother (dad's side) was buried"
09-08-2019T15:03:15,BadFoMo,Why is this reminding me of that one Collage Humor video where the guy thought his grandfather was a huge Wolfenstine nerd?
09-08-2019T15:03:36,SageSaga,i want to see that
09-08-2019T15:03:37,FoxxTrotter,"Regardless, both derivatives come from the Rhineland region."

09-08-2019T15:19:49,FloofyCat,Tbh I'd have thought she'd look good of wearing a t-shirt with a graphic of the potato sack reference sheet on it.
09-08-2019T15:19:59,FloofyCat,look good wearing a t-shirt*
09-08-2019T15:19:59,CrRAR,Haha

09-08-2019T15:56:50,BadFoMo,@Mihari Turret: Deploying.
09-08-2019T15:57:16,FloofyCat,"Hey, anyone ever play Rainbow 6 Siege?"
09-08-2019T15:57:19,FloofyCat,That game has no doors.
09-08-2019T15:57:36,FloofyCat,It took me over a year of playing it to actually realise that nowhere is there a door in that game.
09-08-2019T15:57:40,Ordithus,What.  How does a Rainbow 6 game not have doors
09-08-2019T15:57:45,SavageJenner,New page on my birthday. Awesome
09-08-2019T15:57:46,CrRAR,Sounds innovative

09-08-2019T15:58:42,Mihari,If there is a door at all it's just a enviroment prop and not functional.
09-08-2019T15:58:58,Mihari,Cause you have to seal or breech into them
09-08-2019T15:59:10,Ordithus,I guess they really changed how the game plays with Siege
09-08-2019T15:59:11,CrRAR,Keep your C4 handy!
09-08-2019T15:59:15,Dadrobit,"Huh, haven't played R6 since PS2 days. They used to have doors back then at least."
09-08-2019T15:59:20,Kufky,:birthday: !

09-08-2019T15:59:51,SageSaga,wow you both played a game that doesnt exist?
09-08-2019T16:00:02,BadFoMo,Is that the one with the video of the AI glitching through the door leaving the player stuck?
09-08-2019T16:00:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"It's real, I tells you"

09-08-2019T16:01:58,BadFoMo,"AI: Um... Wait. ...****, we forgot the Mortal. (Glitches back into the room with the player and kicks down the door for them.)"
09-08-2019T16:02:00,Ordithus,If we're going to be that hard on Marv for a typo :ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:

09-08-2019T16:02:45,MarvTheHugPharaoh,then it sets
09-08-2019T16:03:01,Mihari,There should be a ban rule for smartasses.

09-08-2019T16:06:40,Mihari,Nevada you mean?
09-08-2019T16:06:48,BadFoMo,Thank you.
09-08-2019T16:07:22,BluePhantom90,I take Karen is asking Reni if she wants to join them
09-08-2019T16:07:37,sunblaze,rule 1 -> Mihari is right
09-08-2019T16:07:46,NezumiYuki,Go on Reni... Join the ADVENTURE!
09-08-2019T16:07:47,sunblaze,rule 2: is she is not right see rule 1
09-08-2019T16:07:48,CrRAR,"Wow sage, if a tree could be described as wise... that's the wisest tree of them all."
09-08-2019T16:08:03,Mihari,"Ha! That's false, I'll be the first to admit I'm wrong a lot."

09-08-2019T16:09:07,Ordithus,I like that tree
09-08-2019T16:09:15,CrRAR,"Sit under it, gain INT points."

09-08-2019T16:09:28,NezumiYuki,Ahh that I like if that's true!
09-08-2019T16:09:34,sunblaze,imagine that tree with a staff and a fancy hat and the tree would NOT LET YOU PASS!
09-08-2019T16:09:35,NezumiYuki,I could always use more INT
09-08-2019T16:10:17,CrRAR,"Expand your brain, expand your horizons~"
09-08-2019T16:11:01,NezumiYuki,"I know body parts expansion is a thing in the furry fandom, but is there a thing as cranial expansion?"
09-08-2019T16:11:45,BadFoMo,...Maybe?
09-08-2019T16:11:52,CrRAR,We may need to consult an internet archaeologist.
09-08-2019T16:11:58,AspiringNoodle,"Rule 34, Yuki. Rule 34..."
09-08-2019T16:12:08,BadFoMo,Does it explode afterward?
09-08-2019T16:12:25,NezumiYuki,"ooooooh kay... thanks for that mental image, Noodles... ahem  CHANGE OF SUBJECT!"
09-08-2019T16:12:27,sunblaze,cranial expansion is not a furry only thing. plenty of cultures did that. not always to the health of the bodies attached to it
09-08-2019T16:12:42,Ordithus,I remember that being a weapon in Timesplitters Future Perfect.  Gruesome
09-08-2019T16:13:18,NezumiYuki,"Ahem... in other news.... How are things on your end, Mihari?"
09-08-2019T16:13:25,CrRAR,I miss Big Head Mode being a thing in games xD

09-08-2019T16:33:02,Mihari,"I'm not liking the dev build of Edge, but this new Opera Browser is really nice so far."
09-08-2019T16:33:21,LannAF,I have imprisoned my first cow.
09-08-2019T16:33:25,LannAF,it begins.
09-08-2019T16:33:25,Mihari,Firefox has a memory leak the size of the US treasury debt.
09-08-2019T16:33:26,CrRAR,"Yeah Msft makes bad decisions all the time, it's like... their business model."
09-08-2019T16:34:10,Mihari,"I liked my slaughter house, that curned out so much beef XD"
09-08-2019T16:34:14,LannAF,sounds like my kinda business model
09-08-2019T16:34:21,TeapotOfDoom,I used a browser called vivaldi for some time. It's nice but i'm really used to firefox. Went back after a few months. Even then holding me for a few months is quite good
09-08-2019T16:34:22,Mihari,"you had what, 8000 in a day? XD"
09-08-2019T16:34:32,CrRAR,and firefox yup continues to be the upstart adolescent of the bunch still having growing pains.
09-08-2019T16:34:34,TeapotOfDoom,Nice loot mihari
09-08-2019T16:34:35,LannAF,not enough
09-08-2019T16:34:41,BadFoMo,What are we talking about?
09-08-2019T16:34:44,LannAF,cover the land with beef

09-08-2019T16:34:53,SageSaga,8000 in about 8 hours
09-08-2019T16:34:54,Mihari,"Why make more than that, you'd never use it all."
09-08-2019T16:35:01,LannAF,for the pleasure
09-08-2019T16:35:03,BigSonicFan,Hey~ ^^/

09-08-2019T16:35:32,LannAF,beefmaster supreme
09-08-2019T16:35:39,MarvTheHugPharaoh,beef me daddy
09-08-2019T16:35:41,NezumiYuki,"""Where's the beef?!"""
09-08-2019T16:35:43,IronHorseComics,too late I already ate the beef
09-08-2019T16:35:43,LannAF,in reality I used tofu for my burgers in mc
09-08-2019T16:35:46,TeapotOfDoom,Firefox has a memory leak? I never noticed... the ram usage is still way better then chrome lol
09-08-2019T16:35:49,IronHorseComics,except it was steaj
09-08-2019T16:35:53,LannAF,so I'm a heretic
09-08-2019T16:35:53,CrRAR,Real beef!? Not sustainable enough. Beff SUBSTITUTE!

09-08-2019T16:36:08,MarvTheHugPharaoh,don't beef me with tofu
09-08-2019T16:36:16,Mihari,Chrome is heavy because it keeps itself constantly running in the background.
09-08-2019T16:36:27,CrRAR,Yeah Chrome is weird.
09-08-2019T16:36:38,TeapotOfDoom,Also being a power user i find it hard to adapt to a new environment...
09-08-2019T16:36:55,CrRAR,Plus they recently (6 months ago) made that change to isolate each tab more using up to 10% more RAM each.
09-08-2019T16:37:09,CrRAR,It's a security thing.
09-08-2019T16:37:19,Mihari,"Same, but thankfully as a web dev I'm forced to use multiple browers to test how a site looks, and the more i used Opera the more I like it."
09-08-2019T16:37:31,Mihari,Roll20 runs beautifully on it.
09-08-2019T16:37:44,TeapotOfDoom,I wonder what the memory management policy for firefox does differently to chrome...
09-08-2019T16:38:11,CrRAR,:fire:
09-08-2019T16:38:18,BadFoMo,"Roll20 is the RPG site, right?"
09-08-2019T16:38:23,LannAF,ye
09-08-2019T16:38:24,TeapotOfDoom,You work on roll20 or just use it with opera?
09-08-2019T16:38:26,LannAF,wait
09-08-2019T16:38:31,LannAF,Opera runs roll20 well?
09-08-2019T16:38:37,LannAF,because chrome runs it like ass
09-08-2019T16:38:38,Mihari,Yes. Very well.
09-08-2019T16:38:45,LannAF,hmMMM
09-08-2019T16:38:46,Mihari,@TeapotOfDoom No just using it.

09-08-2019T17:49:39,Nekonny,Not going to finish it today?
09-08-2019T17:49:46,TeapotOfDoom,Cat is smaller then cheetah tho
09-08-2019T17:50:14,TeapotOfDoom,Could fit through stuff
09-08-2019T17:50:34,Mihari,"Do you know how fast a cheetah can accelerate, a house cat wouldn't have a chance."
09-08-2019T17:50:51,Nekonny,in a house they would just crash into a wall
09-08-2019T17:51:45,SpazztasticKiwi,so I’m having to carry my zapper around with me again
09-08-2019T17:51:47,Mihari,"For Ron tho, I'd go coolaid mode."
09-08-2019T17:51:49,Mihari,OH YAH!
09-08-2019T17:51:56,NezumiYuki,Pffffffff  xD
09-08-2019T17:52:09,TeapotOfDoom,hahaha
09-08-2019T17:52:14,TeapotOfDoom,oh no
09-08-2019T17:52:21,Ordithus,What happened Kiwi
09-08-2019T17:52:51,BadFoMo,Zapper?
09-08-2019T17:53:00,SpazztasticKiwi,stun gun
09-08-2019T17:53:04,SpazztasticKiwi,taser
09-08-2019T17:53:08,SpazztasticKiwi,any clearer?
09-08-2019T17:53:30,BadFoMo,"Yes, very clear."
09-08-2019T17:53:52,SpazztasticKiwi,there’s this old man who thinks it’s his job to boss employees into parking in the employee area
09-08-2019T17:54:05,Nekonny,"well ok, I guess I'll just go draw in my own little corner, all by my lonesome ;_;"
09-08-2019T17:54:09,SpazztasticKiwi,the employee area is at the end of the lot - I work night shift
09-08-2019T17:54:25,TeapotOfDoom,aw poor ron
09-08-2019T17:54:30,Ordithus,"Have fun in your corner, Ron!  I'd join but I'm about to head out"
09-08-2019T17:54:54,SpazztasticKiwi,it may be that man or it may be someone else but it was discussed today - a note telling me employees park elsewhere was on my car yesterday
09-08-2019T17:55:15,Ordithus,"If there's ample parking who cares, wtf"
09-08-2019T17:55:36,SpazztasticKiwi,this guys ocd about it
09-08-2019T17:55:40,TeapotOfDoom,people are weird
09-08-2019T17:56:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I got roasted beef and peppers and chicken rice for foods
09-08-2019T17:59:52,NezumiYuki,Mmm sounds good Kiwis  :D
09-08-2019T18:02:41,MviluUatusun,"Well, once again, I got so tied up with other things I missed Tom's stream."
09-08-2019T18:02:51,TeapotOfDoom,Hi Mvilu
09-08-2019T18:02:57,MviluUatusun,Howdy Teapot.
09-08-2019T18:03:52,TeapotOfDoom,Well Sage's got your back sorta
09-08-2019T18:04:09,TeapotOfDoom,My stream died again -_-
09-08-2019T18:04:57,SpazztasticKiwi,buffer is 0/10
09-08-2019T18:05:14,Nekonny,I have to jump out to focus on one chat

09-08-2019T18:16:01,BadFoMo,Oh.

09-08-2019T18:17:12,Ordithus,Bye Sage!
09-08-2019T18:17:15,TeapotOfDoom,Night Sage! Thanks for streaming
09-08-2019T18:17:18,FoxxTrotter,"C-ya, Sage. Thanks for the stream."
09-08-2019T18:17:31,Bgrmystr2,"damn, tree lookin nice"
09-08-2019T18:17:42,Ordithus,That tree is a mountain
09-08-2019T18:17:50,Bgrmystr2,That mountain is a spy!
09-08-2019T18:18:01,TeapotOfDoom,Meet the spy
09-08-2019T18:18:11,Ordithus,Spy is spy!
09-08-2019T18:18:16,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock:
09-08-2019T18:18:44,TeapotOfDoom,What? It was abviously him. He'll turn red any second now.
09-08-2019T18:18:55,Bgrmystr2,aaaany second now...
09-08-2019T18:19:01,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-laugh:
09-08-2019T18:19:08,TeapotOfDoom,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
09-08-2019T18:19:12,BadFoMo,Right behind you.
09-08-2019T18:19:20,Bgrmystr2,"that was a good vid, teapot"
09-08-2019T18:19:33,TeapotOfDoom,Yes it was
09-08-2019T18:20:12,TeapotOfDoom,I am heavy weapons guy
09-08-2019T18:20:18,TeapotOfDoom,And T H I S
09-08-2019T18:20:25,TeapotOfDoom,is my weapon
09-08-2019T18:21:39,TeapotOfDoom,Have you seen the Turbulance fan animation?
09-08-2019T18:38:46,TeapotOfDoom,I'm off to bed. Night y'all! :ctwokinds-RainezZz:
09-08-2019T18:50:27,MviluUatusun,Time to get ready for bed.  I'll see y'all next time.
09-08-2019T19:14:20,Twokinds,Oh no
09-08-2019T19:14:45,Twokinds,"I need to have Reni actually think something to herself for once, but I don't know how to represent that, since all her speech is thoughts."
09-08-2019T19:14:58,Ordithus,OH YEAH :ctwokinds-sleepoverA:
09-08-2019T19:15:22,Ordithus,That is a pickle
09-08-2019T19:15:23,Bgrmystr2,haha oh no
09-08-2019T19:16:14,Ordithus,Maybe she is incapable of inner thought :ctwokinds-reniderp_flip:
09-08-2019T19:16:20,Ordithus,And must always shout
09-08-2019T19:16:26,Bgrmystr2,xD
09-08-2019T19:17:10,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, she did mention things we won't speak about keiran"
09-08-2019T19:23:05,AspiringNoodle,Is there some text format you haven't used yet?
09-08-2019T19:23:43,Ordithus,Wingings
09-08-2019T19:23:50,Ordithus,*Wingdings
09-08-2019T19:27:34,Dadrobit,Thought bubble within a thought bubble.
09-08-2019T19:28:14,AspiringNoodle,^
09-08-2019T19:28:16,AspiringNoodle,BRILLIANT! XD
09-08-2019T19:34:07,Ordithus,Funny how this is the first time it's come up
09-08-2019T19:38:10,Ordithus,I guess in the past you've just used thought bubbles without anyone else in that panel?  It might work well enough at least
09-08-2019T19:40:59,AspiringNoodle,Also depends on the text being presented
09-08-2019T19:43:07,AspiringNoodle,"Dad, I was hired by the gas station, and I got weird hours.  Am I an adult yet?lol"
09-08-2019T19:43:29,AspiringNoodle,"If anything, it should motivate me to get in gear and do something :/"
09-08-2019T19:48:39,Dadrobit,Grats on the income. First real job?
09-08-2019T19:49:47,AspiringNoodle,first and a half?
09-08-2019T19:50:20,AspiringNoodle,I had a job at a local restaurant that's more akin to a fast-food style thing
09-08-2019T19:50:43,AspiringNoodle,"It was weird.  I was never officially terminated, but I stopped getting called in"
09-08-2019T19:51:55,AspiringNoodle,"The only thing that has me slightly upset is that I'd be hired for second shift, which is 2 - 10.  But my days will all seem to end at 11 -_-"
09-08-2019T19:52:01,Dadrobit,"My little brother did something like that. Worked for a security company where you had to call in to check for available jobs to do for the day. Never officially quit, and they still sometimes call him for job openings, but he hasn't done a shift in years"
09-08-2019T19:52:46,Dadrobit,He's been a manager for Petsmart for years now besides.
09-08-2019T19:53:00,AspiringNoodle,"Tbh, it seems like jobs are effed up no matter where you go xD"
09-08-2019T19:53:16,Dadrobit,shrugs
09-08-2019T19:53:27,Dadrobit,You gotta do what you gotta do to put food on the table.
09-08-2019T19:54:44,AspiringNoodle,"I'm gonna find out real quick what I like doing, lol"
09-08-2019T19:54:48,Dadrobit,"Also, why do you consider 2-10 weird hours?"
09-08-2019T19:55:12,AspiringNoodle,shrugs
09-08-2019T19:55:17,Dadrobit,Standard swing shift.
09-08-2019T19:55:30,AspiringNoodle,At least all my computer parts are here
09-08-2019T19:55:40,AspiringNoodle,"I'll either build tomorrow before work, or on Monday when i'm off"
09-08-2019T19:56:14,AspiringNoodle,"And once it's up and running, I lose any remaining excuses for putting off stuff :P"
09-08-2019T19:57:51,SomeNiceUser,busts through the broken door.
09-08-2019T19:58:06,SomeNiceUser,Hey guys!
09-08-2019T19:59:14,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-shock:*[*Startled noodle noises*]
09-08-2019T20:01:29,SomeNiceUser,I’m doing some research on that laptop so I can make sure that it would be college ready. The storage is the only real problem.
09-08-2019T20:02:03,SomeNiceUser,I need at least 1tb or more.
09-08-2019T20:02:21,AspiringNoodle,I saw something interesting on newegg :D
09-08-2019T20:02:33,AspiringNoodle,"860 evo 2TB 2.5"" $280"
09-08-2019T20:02:38,Ordithus,External storage
09-08-2019T20:02:44,AspiringNoodle,860 evo 2TB M.2 SATA $330
09-08-2019T20:02:58,AspiringNoodle,Corsair MP600 2TB M.2 PCIe Gen 4 $460
09-08-2019T20:03:06,AspiringNoodle,Or was it $450?
09-08-2019T20:04:18,Dadrobit,bbl
09-08-2019T20:17:39,SomeNiceUser,eats a croissant.
09-08-2019T20:27:17,qwe304,@AspiringNoodle do not buy an m.2 sata ssd
09-08-2019T20:27:30,qwe304,sata is 600mbps max
09-08-2019T20:28:06,AspiringNoodle,"It's just a form factor, lol"
09-08-2019T20:28:19,qwe304,no m.2 is the form factor
09-08-2019T20:28:21,AspiringNoodle,"Granted, there's a slight price premium because of it"
09-08-2019T20:28:28,qwe304,sata is the connection type
09-08-2019T20:28:37,AspiringNoodle,"But if you want a SATA drive without the extra cables and such, it's an option"
09-08-2019T20:28:54,qwe304,i guess
09-08-2019T20:29:01,qwe304,but its a waste of an m.2 slot
09-08-2019T20:29:21,AspiringNoodle,"For my particular mobo, the 3rd M.2 slot will be for a sata drive if I ever feel like using it"
09-08-2019T20:34:24,Bgrmystr2,you may as well just get a normal SSD then
09-08-2019T20:34:55,Bgrmystr2,"the M.2 won't give you any benefits if it's a sata. on top of that, it's just taking up an m.2 drive that could potentially be an NVMe"
09-08-2019T20:37:45,AspiringNoodle,"Yes, but for my particular motherboard, the 3rd M.2 slot shares bandwidth with the sata slots through the chipset"
09-08-2019T20:37:57,AspiringNoodle,"And if I use a NVME M.2, 2 sata slots are disabled"
09-08-2019T20:38:34,AspiringNoodle,"MSI seems to have the same design limitation, since they also have 3 m.2 slots on their MEG ACE, but they went ahead and just stripped 2 of the 6 slots out ahead of time"
09-08-2019T20:39:29,Bgrmystr2,NVMe is more than twice as fast as one sata so that really isn't a drawback.
09-08-2019T20:39:42,AspiringNoodle,It is if you're going at it from a capacity standpoint
09-08-2019T20:40:21,AspiringNoodle,"Especially since it could end up being 1 high performing 2TB M.2, vs two decent 4TB SSDs, or 2 even larger capacity HDDs"
09-08-2019T20:40:49,AspiringNoodle,"I'm not exactly sure what the capacity limit of 3.5"" drives is today ^^;"
09-08-2019T20:40:54,Bgrmystr2,"Get external storage then? Also, drives are super big now."
09-08-2019T20:41:32,Bgrmystr2,2 internal sata ports isn't that much of a loss imo
09-08-2019T20:41:48,AspiringNoodle,"exactly, in your opinion"
09-08-2019T20:42:03,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-karenOOO:
09-08-2019T20:42:21,AspiringNoodle,"And in my opinion, the potential storage space outweighs the increased performance of a single drive of rather limited storage ;)"
09-08-2019T20:42:37,AspiringNoodle,"And ord, no, stahp"
09-08-2019T20:42:45,AspiringNoodle,Things will escalate :ptv-shock:
09-08-2019T20:42:47,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-statuerawr: na
09-08-2019T20:42:58,AspiringNoodle,Okay then :ptv-uneasy:
09-08-2019T20:43:32,Bgrmystr2,It's not like you have a good excuse though. External drives exist. Newsflash if you weren't aware. :V
09-08-2019T20:44:02,AspiringNoodle,Yes.  They do exist.  But what if someone wants storage located inside their PC :P
09-08-2019T20:44:36,AspiringNoodle,"If that one M.2 slot is such a big deal, there's also PCIe gen 4 M.2 expansion cards"
09-08-2019T20:44:50,AspiringNoodle,Lets you fit 4 drives on a x16 slot
09-08-2019T20:45:36,AspiringNoodle,Though I imagine there are serious limitations to that...
09-08-2019T20:45:48,Bgrmystr2,They need to realize not everything is a problem. You can also get a PCI card for more drive connections
09-08-2019T20:46:34,AspiringNoodle,Doesn't change the crux of the argument
09-08-2019T20:47:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m not even salty at this point I’m marinated
09-08-2019T20:47:43,AspiringNoodle,Oh no
09-08-2019T20:47:50,Bgrmystr2,There's plenty of ways to do both. You're ignoring everything but one outcome to suit your argument. xD
09-08-2019T20:47:55,AspiringNoodle,Why so marinated? ...doesn't have the same ring to it :c
09-08-2019T20:48:19,AspiringNoodle,I'm making an argument from a storage-oriented perspective
09-08-2019T20:48:47,SpazztasticKiwi,this old man wanna try bossing me into parking somewhere he deems acceptable when there’s multiple other employees playing parking free for all
09-08-2019T20:48:52,SpazztasticKiwi,we gonna fight
09-08-2019T20:49:03,AspiringNoodle,Oh nuuuuuuu
09-08-2019T20:49:35,SpazztasticKiwi,cause I’m not about to have security walk me to my car every night just cause grandpa has ocd and can’t mind his own business
09-08-2019T20:49:37,Ordithus,"If this old man is harrassing employees, it seems he needs to leave"
09-08-2019T20:49:55,NibblyBot,New Comic Page: Mind Manipulation http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/1074/
09-08-2019T20:50:22,SpazztasticKiwi,buddy they’ve “banned” customers for stealing before and it’s still ignored if they keep coming
09-08-2019T20:50:46,SpazztasticKiwi,unless dude pulls a knife or gets violent they’re not doing a thing
09-08-2019T20:51:41,AspiringNoodle,Where's the muscle when you need 'em?
09-08-2019T20:51:44,AspiringNoodle,"""There a problem here?"""
09-08-2019T20:52:17,Ordithus,":ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl: Good page, Tom!"
09-08-2019T20:52:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m pretty sure the guy only does it to people he can intimidate
09-08-2019T20:53:36,SpazztasticKiwi,only other person I know he’s seemed to bug is a lady he harped on for parking up close and she wasn’t even on the clock yet
09-08-2019T20:54:08,SpazztasticKiwi,this job needs hazard pay
09-08-2019T20:55:33,Bgrmystr2,"I return, and yes noodle, one of many many more."
09-08-2019T20:56:39,Bgrmystr2,"Honestly, kiwi, I'd rather employees park where they're supposed to. Too many a time I see them all parked close up to the store in the front depriving people of handicapped spots and other close spots during bad weather.."
09-08-2019T20:56:42,Bgrmystr2,but that being said
09-08-2019T20:56:53,Bgrmystr2,I also don't know if it's really a big deal at nighttime when noone's around
09-08-2019T20:57:08,Bgrmystr2,"but you never know, something could happen and there could be a massive influx of people"
09-08-2019T20:57:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I park where I park because that’s where I come in from where I live
09-08-2019T20:57:43,SpazztasticKiwi,and I’ve already had enough people bug me at work that I’d rather take the longer ride
09-08-2019T20:57:44,SomeNiceUser,So many options...
09-08-2019T20:57:46,Bgrmystr2,"happens all the time here, hurricanes and shit. People mob stores due to evacuation notices and stuff"
09-08-2019T20:57:52,SpazztasticKiwi,often IN THE DARK because I work noght
09-08-2019T20:58:32,Bgrmystr2,"also, as far as I know, stores have to pay a premium to have staff parking, where no ordinary customers park, but then staff doesn't even use it."
09-08-2019T20:58:40,SpazztasticKiwi,and you realize this isn’t just “you’re in a handicap spot”
09-08-2019T20:58:44,Bgrmystr2,just seems a waste of money
09-08-2019T20:59:00,SpazztasticKiwi,also this isn’t employee only parking - it’s open to everyone
09-08-2019T20:59:03,Ordithus,"Bgr, this is Walmart.  They own the parking."
09-08-2019T20:59:06,Bgrmystr2,Yeah I know
09-08-2019T20:59:11,Bgrmystr2,yes I know ord

09-08-2019T21:42:08,SpazztasticKiwi,on my bed
09-08-2019T21:42:15,SpazztasticKiwi,hopped on my bare leg
09-08-2019T21:42:25,Ordithus,:frog:*[Friend!]
09-08-2019T21:42:36,SpazztasticKiwi,and started wandering up my calf
09-08-2019T21:42:39,Ordithus,That's a bold amphibian
09-08-2019T21:43:19,SpazztasticKiwi,you imagine for a minute having the one leg out of the covers thing at night and a damp cold thing just plats on your leg
09-08-2019T21:43:24,SpazztasticKiwi,in the dark
09-08-2019T21:43:48,SpazztasticKiwi,demons and I are gonna have a come to Jesus meeting
09-08-2019T21:44:30,SpazztasticKiwi,but no I just got up - suddenly enough that I tossed the poor thing near across the room - and got rid of it
09-08-2019T21:45:12,SpazztasticKiwi,somebody needs to start watching the door when we open it or Bagheera has learned to conjure wild animals in the house
09-08-2019T21:45:25,Ordithus,Yeah not an unexpected reaction
09-08-2019T21:45:55,Ordithus,I had a spider move in last night.  No idea where it went.
09-08-2019T21:46:25,Ordithus,"Fast little bugger, kept scurrying away."
09-08-2019T21:46:30,SpazztasticKiwi,“remember when you threw a shoe at me and I fell behind the bed? Me too”
09-08-2019T21:47:53,SpazztasticKiwi,so for snack I have pimento cheese and avocado
