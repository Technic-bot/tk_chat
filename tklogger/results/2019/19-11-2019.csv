19-11-2019T02:03:03,SpazztasticKiwi,you know the game everyone‚Äôs pumped over because of who the developer is and Norman Reedus & Troy Baker are in it

19-11-2019T09:11:17,JojoF2415,Good morning
19-11-2019T10:37:22,RimaDraws,Morning jojo
19-11-2019T13:35:09,SpazztasticKiwi,I was tempted to take it as a joke but I‚Äôve also seen and talked to people who‚Äôre shocked when they‚Äôre finally exposed to an actual example so
19-11-2019T13:35:17,SpazztasticKiwi,eh
19-11-2019T13:36:45,SpazztasticKiwi,there is a nice game that should probably be played in schools to give kids in health class a good ~educational experience~
19-11-2019T15:21:19,Dadrobit,"@RimaDraws Tell me about it. Between all my siblings, I've got a dozen neices and nephews with my little brother bringing #13 into the fold a few months out."
19-11-2019T15:44:15,SpazztasticKiwi,biggest bunch I know of is the one cousin with 5 boys
19-11-2019T15:45:08,SpazztasticKiwi,"with them, it‚Äôs there‚Äôs only 6 of em since my other cousin had her daughter"
19-11-2019T15:45:53,SpazztasticKiwi,though that‚Äôs all second cousins - no nieces or nephews

19-11-2019T17:49:13,ThingsAreMoving,"I'm wondering... is putting suggestions sooner than other people making it more likely to be in the first poll round, or is it random where it's going to end up?"
19-11-2019T17:56:02,Twokinds,It's completely random.
19-11-2019T17:57:08,Twokinds,tkpolls automatically shuffles the suggestions when they're split into four parts.
19-11-2019T17:59:45,ThingsAreMoving,Knowledge acquired. Thanks!
19-11-2019T18:07:05,Dadrobit,Suggestion submitted!
19-11-2019T18:07:48,Dadrobit,"Last week I got one vote and didn't even participate. So this week if I vote as well, I'm looking at DOUBLING my voting base! \o/"
19-11-2019T18:49:43,BadFoMo,"Same. Both submitted and 1 vote. By the way, what's your's again? My memory is a little crap."
19-11-2019T18:50:46,Dadrobit,"Sythe in regalia giving diplomatic ""Advice"" to the Basitin trio."

19-11-2019T18:52:42,TerraTheWizard,i'm putting my adelaide one in again because it did good last week and maybe it will again :ctwokinds-FloDance:
19-11-2019T18:52:56,SpazztasticKiwi,stupid question but engineered wood shouldn‚Äôt have a problem sitting in 50 degree weather for a few hour s right
19-11-2019T18:53:23,Dadrobit,F or C?
19-11-2019T18:54:00,SpazztasticKiwi,american

19-11-2019T18:54:43,Dadrobit,"Also, ""Engineered wood?"""
19-11-2019T18:55:40,Dadrobit,"Like, plywood?"
19-11-2019T18:55:45,SpazztasticKiwi,that‚Äôs what it says
19-11-2019T18:55:48,Dadrobit,Particle Board?
19-11-2019T18:56:16,SpazztasticKiwi,‚Äúengineered wood‚Äù
19-11-2019T18:56:34,Dadrobit,Could be a lotta things tbh
19-11-2019T18:56:59,Dadrobit,"But yeah, mild cold isn't gonna hurt wood or any decent adhesive."

19-11-2019T19:00:02,SpazztasticKiwi,it also says ‚Äúsome‚Äù assembly with a screwdriver & hammer
19-11-2019T19:00:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"if it ends up needing a power tool, I won‚Äôt be happy"
19-11-2019T19:00:24,SpazztasticKiwi,but it‚Äôs a day early
19-11-2019T19:01:16,Dadrobit,98% That's particle board.
19-11-2019T19:01:32,Dadrobit,"And no, it's definitely just gonna need a screwdriver."

19-11-2019T19:03:17,Dadrobit,"From one of the reviews, definitely particle board."
19-11-2019T19:04:42,Dadrobit,Essentially it's wood chips and sawdust held together with glue.
19-11-2019T19:05:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I know what particle board is
19-11-2019T19:06:32,Dadrobit,Great stuff for inexpensive hobbyist woodworking.
