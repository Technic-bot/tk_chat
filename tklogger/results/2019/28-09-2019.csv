28-09-2019T18:06:13,xcvb,bloody red is fine
28-09-2019T18:06:20,SomeNiceUser,The one that matches the eye color.
28-09-2019T18:06:21,AnuSekaniArt,The red and white is really eye catching
28-09-2019T18:06:38,sunkaiu000,Red and white i guess is pretty common
28-09-2019T18:06:42,Tharkis,@Sclimshady wisp glows too http://www.tharkis.com/images/tharkis/halcy0n_tharkis_wisp_studying_small.png  ( Safe for work cute art )

28-09-2019T18:07:43,xcvb,nah
28-09-2019T18:07:53,SomeNiceUser,That looks pretty cute Tharkis!
28-09-2019T18:07:59,Avolendi,"Was expecting the light blue faint outer glow, but not sure how it mixes with the red now. The red does have its appeal over the black... So yeah I'm not helping ^^;"
28-09-2019T18:07:59,FloofyCat,I'm liking the red spots
28-09-2019T18:08:02,xcvb,white and bloody red is awsome
28-09-2019T18:08:27,sunkaiu000,Bit intense though

28-09-2019T18:09:19,Avolendi,Yeah but I feel her vibe is more sadness/loneliness? So too much vibrancy kinda clashes with that
28-09-2019T18:09:21,xcvb,make it be
28-09-2019T18:09:50,CrRAR,Black was more innocuous
28-09-2019T18:09:53,Avolendi,"So I'd think like this works better, without too much red? imho"

28-09-2019T18:12:50,Stormagedon,It's just leading you have to be worried about. I would say touching is fine
28-09-2019T18:13:11,Avolendi,"Hmm. Felt like it hit a good spot (for me) with blueish shadow for a bit, but hard to say when that was. The front/back constrast is nice, but the head (at that time) had still too much red/brightness I think. But that's some time again now, so nm ^^;"
28-09-2019T18:14:06,sunkaiu000,He could stop now and no one would complain

28-09-2019T21:11:20,Dadrobit,:( I think I need some new Dualshocks...
28-09-2019T21:11:59,Dadrobit,One has a dying battery and the other has a sticky thumbstick
28-09-2019T21:12:11,AspiringNoodle,Awwwww
28-09-2019T21:12:31,AspiringNoodle,"I know the feeling, my 360's controller is pretty damn worn"
28-09-2019T21:13:02,AspiringNoodle,"Also, Dad, now we wait and see"
28-09-2019T21:13:09,Dadrobit,?
28-09-2019T21:13:19,AspiringNoodle,"I'm officially on the ""I'm done with scratch offs for a long while"" bandwagon :3"
28-09-2019T21:13:27,Dadrobit,gl
28-09-2019T21:16:41,AspiringNoodle,My 2nd job is really picking up.
28-09-2019T21:16:55,AspiringNoodle,"I'm wondering where it's going to go, and whether or not I'll end up moving on"
28-09-2019T21:17:57,Dadrobit,Another guard from my job just got forced to quit.
28-09-2019T21:18:47,Ordithus,forced?!
28-09-2019T21:19:41,Dadrobit,"Mr. and Mrs. X are in the middle of the divorce. Mrs. X got the rights to the house. She took Mr. X off of the approved guest list, but told the guards that he was allowed entry to the interior country club for their kids' birthday parties."
28-09-2019T21:20:17,Dadrobit,"Mr. X shows up for a party and tells the guard he wants to go to the house, but the guard denies him as per the orders."
28-09-2019T21:21:00,Dadrobit,Mr. X calls Mrs. X and tells her that the guard kept them from the party at the club. The kids start crying that their dad won't be there for them.
28-09-2019T21:21:35,Dadrobit,Mrs. X then goes on to tell the HOA and community at large that Guard has done irrovocalbe damage to their children.
28-09-2019T21:21:45,Ordithus,Wow
28-09-2019T21:21:48,Dadrobit,irrevocable*
28-09-2019T21:22:23,Dadrobit,"Word gets around and by the end of the second day, the whole community knows the guard as a homewrecking child abuser."
28-09-2019T21:22:39,Dadrobit,"So yeah, forced to quit."
28-09-2019T21:22:55,AspiringNoodle,"So, if I'm reading this right, the Mrs. is a royal bitch?"
28-09-2019T21:23:03,Dadrobit,They both are.
28-09-2019T21:23:04,Ordithus,He got stuck smack in the middle of a shit situation without any way out
28-09-2019T21:23:18,Ordithus,And then the company didn't have his back...
28-09-2019T21:23:39,Ordithus,"Please tell me they'll be allowing him to collect unemployment, or something"
28-09-2019T21:23:56,Dadrobit,"But yes, in my interactions with them, the Mrs. is more vitriolic."
28-09-2019T21:24:13,Dadrobit,Dunno what's happening to the dude.
28-09-2019T21:24:21,Dadrobit,"He was a new guy, there less than a month."
28-09-2019T21:24:31,Ordithus,Yikes
28-09-2019T21:25:13,Dadrobit,"And tbh, neither the security agency nor the HOA liked the guy. He was a bit of a fuckup in general."
28-09-2019T21:25:36,Dadrobit,"It was a shitty way to go, but this guy was already on the shit list."
28-09-2019T21:28:53,Ordithus,"He wasn't there long enough for any benefits, really."
28-09-2019T21:29:10,SpazztasticKiwi,I wonder if Tom is ready for his month of solitude to be over
28-09-2019T21:29:20,Dadrobit,"Naw, minimum 3 months for access to healthcare, 4 months for gas benefits."
28-09-2019T21:29:45,SpazztasticKiwi,yeah I got a question for you guys
28-09-2019T21:29:49,Dadrobit,?
28-09-2019T21:29:52,Dadrobit,42
28-09-2019T21:29:56,Ordithus,wassup
28-09-2019T21:30:02,SpazztasticKiwi,ever heard of “cajun mesquite turkey”
28-09-2019T21:30:27,Ordithus,not all at once
28-09-2019T21:30:31,SpazztasticKiwi,lady at work came up and wanted a pound of it and there’s two problems
28-09-2019T21:30:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"we have either or, not one of both"
28-09-2019T21:30:52,SpazztasticKiwi,and both is not possible from what I’ve heard
28-09-2019T21:32:16,Dadrobit,"Yeah, can't say I've had it, but it sounds like a reasonable flavor tbh."
28-09-2019T21:33:02,SpazztasticKiwi,mesquite is smoked while cajun is normally marinated
28-09-2019T21:33:44,Dadrobit,You can marinade a meat while it's being smoked.
28-09-2019T21:34:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"maybe if you knew exactly what you were doing but the main point is we don’t have one, we have either or"
28-09-2019T21:34:20,Ordithus,"considering a lot of ""smoked"" meat is really just a flavor injection..."
28-09-2019T21:34:38,Dadrobit,Also a valid point ^
28-09-2019T21:34:55,Ordithus,"It is possible.  Kiwi, this is how you get rich"
28-09-2019T21:35:10,SpazztasticKiwi,the prima deli stuff we get and they’ve been replacing everything with better be actually smoked for the prices they’re quoting for
28-09-2019T21:35:53,SpazztasticKiwi,$6-$7 a pound better be close to smoked in a gold furnace in the holy hills of the monks
28-09-2019T21:36:15,Dadrobit,6-7 is... not particularly expensive tbh.
28-09-2019T21:36:34,SpazztasticKiwi,that’s the low average
28-09-2019T21:37:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"other than that, yesterday a lady came up to the desk with a little boy in tears"
28-09-2019T21:37:31,Ordithus,I though monks were supposed to live in poverty
28-09-2019T21:38:14,SpazztasticKiwi,isn’t it more like they don’t dwell or keep material possessions unnecessary for living
28-09-2019T21:38:43,SpazztasticKiwi,quick someone ring a monk and ask
28-09-2019T21:39:35,SpazztasticKiwi,"anyhow, the boy was found in grocery separated from his mom"
28-09-2019T21:39:45,SpazztasticKiwi,and he was Upset
28-09-2019T21:40:07,Dadrobit,"Upset is a weird name, but whatevs, it's 2019"
28-09-2019T21:40:14,AspiringNoodle,GOD
28-09-2019T21:40:19,AspiringNoodle,F*CKING

28-09-2019T21:40:33,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
28-09-2019T21:41:45,Ordithus,"So, lost boy, wants momma.  Understandable"
28-09-2019T21:42:07,SpazztasticKiwi,you missed the “‘Upset’? as opposed to ‘Downset’?” joke
28-09-2019T21:42:27,Dadrobit,"The real question, is what it his name now if it WAS Upset"
28-09-2019T21:43:08,Ordithus,":ctwokinds-keith8D: haha yes I got joke, of course"
28-09-2019T21:43:26,SpazztasticKiwi,well his moms name was Mandy or somethin
28-09-2019T21:43:46,SpazztasticKiwi,had to call that lady three times to the service desk
28-09-2019T21:44:47,SpazztasticKiwi,she had to have known her kid was missing and when she shows up “oh we were looking for you in the toys”
28-09-2019T21:46:11,Ordithus,I just stepped into the garage... smells like winter :ctwokinds-nataniAAAAshake:
28-09-2019T21:46:51,AspiringNoodle,I look forward to fall kicking in full swing
28-09-2019T21:47:04,AspiringNoodle,Maybe I'll stop sweating for the first 3 hours of my shift at the gas station :/
28-09-2019T21:47:36,AspiringNoodle,"Maybe if I'm lucky, the other job will pay enough / offer enough hours that I can quit xD"
28-09-2019T21:48:22,SpazztasticKiwi,do you guys want to know what disturbing thing I heard from this group of teens bout a week ago at mcdonalds
28-09-2019T21:48:36,AspiringNoodle,yaaaaaaas
28-09-2019T21:48:47,SpazztasticKiwi,small group - three guys & two girls
28-09-2019T21:49:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"they’ve been up and down getting their food and one gets another a drink, they’re gossiping and being children"
28-09-2019T21:49:57,SpazztasticKiwi,"then one of them asks if another would get them something (buy them something, I guess) to eat"
28-09-2019T21:50:02,SpazztasticKiwi,and this one chick
28-09-2019T21:50:07,SpazztasticKiwi,just about yells
28-09-2019T21:50:21,SpazztasticKiwi,”you can eat my ass”
28-09-2019T21:50:28,AspiringNoodle,RIP
28-09-2019T21:50:30,SpazztasticKiwi,bruh

28-09-2019T21:51:09,RimaDraws,lol
28-09-2019T21:51:39,SpazztasticKiwi,and considering the group I wasn’t sure if she was memeing or trying to hard core flirt
28-09-2019T21:53:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"in better news, Bagheera is good boi"
28-09-2019T21:53:13,AspiringNoodle,kitty get treats? :ptv-excited:
28-09-2019T21:53:14,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-maevecute:
28-09-2019T21:57:01,Dadrobit,"That reminds me, pops just got some new chickens. Gotta bring Oreo over to teach him that chickens are friends, not food."
28-09-2019T21:57:16,Ordithus,why not both?
28-09-2019T21:57:16,SpazztasticKiwi,kitty have treats if he eats his food
28-09-2019T21:57:54,Dadrobit,"Eggs are food, chickens are friends."
28-09-2019T21:58:21,SpazztasticKiwi,but they’re so fun to chase
28-09-2019T21:58:36,Dadrobit,*angry clucking intensifies*
28-09-2019T21:59:26,Dadrobit,They're just little peepers right now though.
28-09-2019T21:59:42,AspiringNoodle,"I swear, some jobs don't pay enough for the amount of tasks / responsibility they bestow upon people :/"

28-09-2019T21:59:55,AspiringNoodle,"Also, any more cute Oreo pics?"
28-09-2019T22:00:00,AspiringNoodle,ORD
28-09-2019T22:00:00,AspiringNoodle,NO
28-09-2019T22:00:06,SpazztasticKiwi,tiny little feathered nuggets
28-09-2019T22:00:50,SpazztasticKiwi,I swapped Bagheera to a new food and its like he’s not hungry anymore
28-09-2019T22:01:05,Ordithus,picky kitty
28-09-2019T22:01:10,SpazztasticKiwi,one problem - it’s the same food he’s been stealing from Kiwi’s bowl
28-09-2019T22:01:10,AspiringNoodle,Was he a pudgy kitty to start with?
28-09-2019T22:02:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Kiwi cannot have food with dyes - so I’ve swapped foods around with her for a long while
28-09-2019T22:02:21,Dadrobit,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/369730908690841600/612841264626401290/Late_night_rampage_.png
28-09-2019T22:02:29,SpazztasticKiwi,"and so, both cats have been fed separate foods"
28-09-2019T22:02:31,Dadrobit,Marv dun made me a thing for Oreo
28-09-2019T22:02:58,Ordithus,adorable destruction
28-09-2019T22:03:23,AspiringNoodle,"Dad, I have a question for yah"
28-09-2019T22:03:30,SpazztasticKiwi,"but walmart has a dye free - it’s local, it’s in bulk 18 pounds a bag, and it’s not miles away in a pet store like I’ve been having to do"
28-09-2019T22:03:33,Dadrobit,shoot
28-09-2019T22:03:48,AspiringNoodle,"If you were required to sell alcohol for a job, how much would you want to be paid?"
28-09-2019T22:03:58,Dadrobit,minimum wage at least
28-09-2019T22:04:05,Ordithus,haha
28-09-2019T22:04:23,SpazztasticKiwi,so I let Bagheera’s old food run out and bought a big bag of Kiwi’s kibble so now both cats are on the same food
28-09-2019T22:04:29,AspiringNoodle,"Okay, now what if I told you that fucking up could come with legal / financial consequences for YOU?"
28-09-2019T22:04:44,Dadrobit,I know that. I was a cashier for like 3 years
28-09-2019T22:04:52,AspiringNoodle,Very well :3
28-09-2019T22:05:01,Sclimshady,Screw. Retail.
28-09-2019T22:05:37,Dadrobit,"Became assistant front end manager, then I got fired for ""theft"" and got into security for the irony."
28-09-2019T22:06:04,SpazztasticKiwi,people also call you dad when you’re not a father
28-09-2019T22:06:18,SpazztasticKiwi,so is that really the beginning of the irony here?
28-09-2019T22:06:49,Sclimshady,Your a father to all of us
28-09-2019T22:09:06,Dadrobit,And yes. Retail is bullshit. Seven bucks an hour is shit pay for what needs to be done.
28-09-2019T22:09:30,Dadrobit,"On the brightside, automation is taking all of those jobs!"
28-09-2019T22:10:11,Sclimshady,7 bucks an hour is shit pay in general.  How many hours would you need to pay even one bill?  A lot
28-09-2019T22:10:21,Dadrobit,All of them
28-09-2019T22:10:27,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-adiracoin:*[More sweet coin for Adira]
28-09-2019T22:10:27,Dadrobit,Work all the hours
28-09-2019T22:10:40,Dadrobit,And then get yelled at because you did more than 30 hours
28-09-2019T22:10:58,AspiringNoodle,At least my gas station pays close to $10 an hour
28-09-2019T22:11:04,AspiringNoodle,But it's still a LOT of stuff to do
28-09-2019T22:11:08,Sclimshady,"I made 8 working 14 hrs a day with no overtime,  literally couldnt pay bills without a second job"
28-09-2019T22:11:46,AspiringNoodle,"2 cashiers on shift, you can get most, if not all tasks done, but it's a bit of a hustle"
28-09-2019T22:11:50,AspiringNoodle,1 person?  forget it
28-09-2019T22:12:00,AspiringNoodle,3?  You can get it done easily before half the shift is over
28-09-2019T22:13:09,AspiringNoodle,"That said, the government really does need to put an automated piece of legislation into place :/"
28-09-2019T22:13:13,SpazztasticKiwi,at least walmart starts cashiers on 10-something an hour
28-09-2019T22:13:33,AspiringNoodle,"No more of this bs where they update whenever they feel like, even if that means 2 or 3 decades later"
28-09-2019T22:13:38,SpazztasticKiwi,then you start getting raises
28-09-2019T22:13:39,Sclimshady,"I got 12 at target, but only like 20 hrs a week"
28-09-2019T22:13:59,Sclimshady,And a 45 min drive to work
28-09-2019T22:14:10,AspiringNoodle,RIP
28-09-2019T22:16:50,SpazztasticKiwi,they hate giving overtime here
28-09-2019T22:17:34,AspiringNoodle,"My gas station kinda has the opposite problem, lol"
28-09-2019T22:17:35,SpazztasticKiwi,they are better at doing the math to keep you under 40 than a kid counting ice cream scoops
28-09-2019T22:17:41,Sclimshady,"Thankfully I get overtime like candy now,  sometimes more than regular time"
28-09-2019T22:17:49,AspiringNoodle,"You can get all the hours you want, just not overtime."
28-09-2019T22:18:16,AspiringNoodle,"We're understaffed, when you consider how many people we have on shift and how much hustle we do to finish the checklist"
28-09-2019T22:18:36,AspiringNoodle,"But according to corporate, we're perfectly staffed for the amount of sales we drive"
28-09-2019T22:18:49,SpazztasticKiwi,I might be closer to getting a car and house
28-09-2019T22:18:50,AspiringNoodle,But none of the store's staff is pulling under 20 hours
28-09-2019T22:19:00,SpazztasticKiwi,the house though I’m waiting on till later
28-09-2019T22:19:10,Ordithus,oooh cool kiwi
28-09-2019T22:19:23,AspiringNoodle,That is still excellent news :D
28-09-2019T22:20:11,Sclimshady,Yay for homeownership \o/
28-09-2019T22:20:24,Dadrobit,grats on progress
28-09-2019T22:20:38,Ordithus,"Speaking of homeownership, I haz new windows"
28-09-2019T22:20:50,Sclimshady,Windows 11 :eyes:
28-09-2019T22:21:01,Sclimshady,House supports all windows
28-09-2019T22:21:06,Ordithus,"... 11 of them, actually"
28-09-2019T22:21:18,AspiringNoodle,The coincidence O:
28-09-2019T22:21:34,Sclimshady,"I know, i've seen  :eyes:"
28-09-2019T22:21:40,Sclimshady,I mean...
28-09-2019T22:21:45,Ordithus,Uh
28-09-2019T22:22:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I am worried about Kiwi
28-09-2019T22:22:13,AspiringNoodle,"Dad, I'm curious"
28-09-2019T22:22:24,AspiringNoodle,What did you do when you worked in retail (in terms of position / responsibilities)
28-09-2019T22:22:26,Sclimshady,What is wrong with the Kiwi?
28-09-2019T22:22:27,SpazztasticKiwi,I gave her one of those soft food packet things
28-09-2019T22:22:40,AspiringNoodle,"Wait, Kiwi has a cat named Kiwi?"
28-09-2019T22:22:40,SpazztasticKiwi,and she downed it in 3 minutes tops
28-09-2019T22:22:44,AspiringNoodle,*head explosion*
28-09-2019T22:22:50,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s where the name is from
28-09-2019T22:22:54,Dadrobit,Manning the cashier primarily. And then whatever needed doing I did when there was free time.
28-09-2019T22:23:12,AspiringNoodle,Sounds nice
28-09-2019T22:23:33,AspiringNoodle,"I've gotten to the point where I used to hustle like crazy to get stuff down, but I've found myself pacing"
28-09-2019T22:23:50,SpazztasticKiwi,oopsie
28-09-2019T22:23:58,SpazztasticKiwi,I cracked an egg boiling it
28-09-2019T22:24:08,AspiringNoodle,"Mainly because half the time, I'll have served the last customer, I don't see any new cards entering the lot / people walking to the door"
28-09-2019T22:24:24,AspiringNoodle,"And I'll be 30 seconds - 1 minute into a checklist task, and then a customer or two walks in"
28-09-2019T22:24:38,AspiringNoodle,And then that turns into me serving customers for 5 - 10 minutes
28-09-2019T22:25:39,AspiringNoodle,"Long story short, retail seems to love spending money on everything BUT workers who actually keep things moving xD"
28-09-2019T22:26:07,SpazztasticKiwi,would you guys say 2 pounds is ok for a scale to be off by
28-09-2019T22:26:24,Sclimshady,Depends what its measuring
28-09-2019T22:26:30,AspiringNoodle,^
28-09-2019T22:26:30,Ordithus,are you measuring iron ore by the ton
28-09-2019T22:26:32,SpazztasticKiwi,I weighed myself then again threeish days later and I don’t see how I lost that
28-09-2019T22:26:34,Dadrobit,I suppose that depends on the scale being measured
28-09-2019T22:26:35,Sclimshady,Baking stuff? no
28-09-2019T22:26:41,Sclimshady,People? yes
28-09-2019T22:26:48,AspiringNoodle,My family has a mechanical scale downstairs that has a zero weight of .5 lbs
28-09-2019T22:26:57,AspiringNoodle,"So I question it's accuracy, but it's close enough :P"
28-09-2019T22:26:57,Dadrobit,2-3 pounds variance is pretty normal day to day
28-09-2019T22:27:06,Sclimshady,You can adjust those
28-09-2019T22:27:15,SpazztasticKiwi,#closeenough
28-09-2019T22:27:31,SpazztasticKiwi,I didn’t consider it to be anything odd
28-09-2019T22:28:51,SpazztasticKiwi,the scales old and it’s normally got me at 141 but it’s now giving me 139ish
28-09-2019T22:29:21,Sclimshady,Smol Kiwi
28-09-2019T22:30:39,SpazztasticKiwi,you ever seen a kiwi
28-09-2019T22:30:47,SpazztasticKiwi,they are big birds
28-09-2019T22:31:00,Ordithus,"football sized, yeah?"
28-09-2019T22:31:03,SpazztasticKiwi,almost completely round
28-09-2019T22:31:14,SpazztasticKiwi,about like a football but flightless
28-09-2019T22:31:15,Sclimshady,"I cant say I have, or even the scale.  Ive eaten Kiwis before"
28-09-2019T22:31:26,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-zenshocked:
28-09-2019T22:31:38,SpazztasticKiwi,but they’re said to be docile
28-09-2019T22:31:48,Sclimshady,Easy to catch
28-09-2019T22:32:22,SpazztasticKiwi,one things for certain
28-09-2019T22:32:35,SpazztasticKiwi,the kiwi bird came before the kiwi fruit
28-09-2019T22:33:33,SpazztasticKiwi,and you don’t realize how much you want cake until you cut it out on a diet
28-09-2019T22:34:38,Sclimshady,I honestly dont like cake
28-09-2019T22:41:57,Ordithus,"Sclim, you aren't human"

28-09-2019T22:55:21,SpazztasticKiwi,"and as late a reaction it is, ye who called smol Kiwi, do keep in mind I’m shorter and most likely younger than all of you on here"
28-09-2019T22:57:22,Sclimshady,"Likely most people here are shorter than me,  Younger, not as many"
28-09-2019T23:01:12,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m 23 in less than a week

28-09-2019T23:12:01,Dadrobit,"Speaking of games, not sure how I feel about Code Vein anymore."
28-09-2019T23:12:15,SpazztasticKiwi,is it...tapped out?
28-09-2019T23:12:31,Sclimshady,It bled out
28-09-2019T23:12:41,Dadrobit,"Like, it's pretty good. It's like a giant weeb made dark souls as a passion project."
28-09-2019T23:13:09,Dadrobit,"It's close, but it's just not quite as technically good."
28-09-2019T23:13:17,unsteddyphoenix,its weebed out
28-09-2019T23:13:33,Dadrobit,The level design in particular is pretty egregious.
28-09-2019T23:13:54,AspiringNoodle,"Too obtuse, or too straight?"
28-09-2019T23:14:20,Dadrobit,"It's like the played Dark Souls, and decided the moments that enemies ambush you from a corner was the best part of the game, so they just made Code Vein maps THAT"
28-09-2019T23:15:00,Dadrobit,"Enemies behind corners is legitimately 85% of the foes you fight, it's just... Tedious at this point."
28-09-2019T23:15:21,Sclimshady,"I never liked dark souls,  If i wanted to hate myself I would just do taxes"
28-09-2019T23:15:23,Dadrobit,And the combat is a bit off.
28-09-2019T23:15:42,unsteddyphoenix,But how are the waifus
28-09-2019T23:15:44,Dadrobit,Enemies have a bad habit of auto-aiming their hits.
28-09-2019T23:15:53,Dadrobit,10/10 waifus
28-09-2019T23:15:55,Sclimshady,Waifus you say :eyes:
28-09-2019T23:16:10,unsteddyphoenix,Im in.
28-09-2019T23:16:50,Dadrobit,"Making a cat girl French maid is pretty amazing, not gonna lie."
28-09-2019T23:17:22,SpazztasticKiwi,ah what it would be like to have simple taste
28-09-2019T23:17:47,Sclimshady,Maid catgirl :ctwokinds-sleepoverA:

28-09-2019T23:20:51,SpazztasticKiwi,the boners just have a mind of their own then huh
28-09-2019T23:21:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I like cat Nora
28-09-2019T23:21:26,SpazztasticKiwi,makes her look sleek and elegant even though she’s not so on two legs
28-09-2019T23:21:32,Sclimshady,"Super loud drunk people by my window, ugh.  I thought I was far away from people but I forgot roomates"
28-09-2019T23:21:46,SpazztasticKiwi,lean out the window and scream
28-09-2019T23:21:57,SpazztasticKiwi,at the least it’ll confuse them
28-09-2019T23:22:03,Sclimshady,Too tired to screm
28-09-2019T23:22:28,SpazztasticKiwi,we got cat maid Nora haven’t we

28-09-2019T23:23:48,SpazztasticKiwi,even poor Nibbly
28-09-2019T23:24:20,Sclimshady,https://www.patreon.com/posts/cat-maid-nora-29288259
28-09-2019T23:25:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I was talking the short skirt maid

28-09-2019T23:25:47,unsteddyphoenix,Cat maid Nora is pretty amazing
28-09-2019T23:25:51,SpazztasticKiwi,"though if we did that with Nora, Eric’s nosebleed would be visible even off camera"
28-09-2019T23:26:29,Sclimshady,Rivers of blood
28-09-2019T23:28:09,Dadrobit,"Oh, almost forgot, there's a hot spring room you can relax in. And it's co-ed."
28-09-2019T23:28:30,Dadrobit,For maximum weeb downtime
28-09-2019T23:28:56,SpazztasticKiwi,“maximum *nosebleed downtime”
28-09-2019T23:29:21,Dadrobit,Almost makes me wish I was more into anime
28-09-2019T23:29:36,AspiringNoodle,"Man am I good at breaking stuff, lol"
28-09-2019T23:29:44,SpazztasticKiwi,but only almost
28-09-2019T23:30:10,AspiringNoodle,Finally make a change to the timestamps to fix the last day of every month having no coupons
28-09-2019T23:30:28,AspiringNoodle,"And now I discover that for some reason, the app is displaying new coupons even though the start date / time hasn't been reached"
28-09-2019T23:30:51,Dadrobit,"Alas, I am a filthy casual. I only really put in the time to watch the easily available stuff like Neo Yokio and The Legend of Kora."
28-09-2019T23:31:02,AspiringNoodle,"I watch too much youtube, Dad"
28-09-2019T23:31:07,AspiringNoodle,Otherwise I'd be watching all the animu
28-09-2019T23:31:29,Sclimshady,Korra is so good though
28-09-2019T23:31:41,Dadrobit,It was pretty solid
28-09-2019T23:31:44,Sclimshady,"And watch Carol and Tuesday, its on netflix"
