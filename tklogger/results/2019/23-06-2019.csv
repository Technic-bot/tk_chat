23-06-2019T01:22:50,Dadrobit,"Ever had one one of those ""I want a snack for dinner"" nights?"
23-06-2019T01:23:18,Dadrobit,Made some tasty biscuits for myself. They are tasty.

23-06-2019T01:25:48,Dadrobit,Cheat day best day
23-06-2019T01:31:14,SpazztasticKiwi,you got cheat day?
23-06-2019T01:31:27,SpazztasticKiwi,nice - back into the exercise circle
23-06-2019T01:31:53,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve had a dead need for veggies and rice lately
23-06-2019T01:32:29,SpazztasticKiwi,put it on a butter roll n make a mini sandwich - been my lunch a few times this week
23-06-2019T01:36:05,Dadrobit,"Naw, today is straight up unhealthy times. Homemade butter biscuits with sharp cheddar mixed in and on top. Then slathered in a butter sauce with parsley, onion, and garlic."
23-06-2019T01:36:32,Dadrobit,Actually not even able to finish this lol. 2.5 down. The rest is going in the fridge methinks.
23-06-2019T02:20:35,SpazztasticKiwi,that’s not unhealthy
23-06-2019T02:21:03,SpazztasticKiwi,fats are a requirement to live and herbs and plants are very healthy
23-06-2019T02:21:13,SpazztasticKiwi,like dairy and grains
23-06-2019T02:21:26,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s like all the food groups in one
23-06-2019T03:20:41,SpazztasticKiwi,🛌

23-06-2019T06:03:22,AspiringNoodle,Did Picarto act weird for anyone else or was it just me?
23-06-2019T06:19:34,AspiringNoodle,"Okay, I'm pretty sure it's just me now xD"
23-06-2019T06:23:57,Bgrmystr2,"naw it prolly broked for everyone, mine disconnected too"
23-06-2019T06:24:04,Bgrmystr2,off to bed :ptv-sleepy:
23-06-2019T07:28:45,AspiringNoodle,Looks like the internet's been freaking out since ~7 A.M. EST
23-06-2019T07:40:17,AspiringNoodle,"Eeeeeeeeey, looks like everything's back to normal!"
23-06-2019T07:43:32,TerraTheWizard,discord is being funky too
23-06-2019T07:46:05,AspiringNoodle,"I tried using Ookla to confirm it was just me, but I was getting full download speeds.  Then Ookla started having connection issues.  Then when I finally connected to it again, it was getting notices of potential problems from big companies"
23-06-2019T07:46:39,AspiringNoodle,"Then when I went to a website that monitors websites for either downtime or complaints of downtime, a lot of big companies were getting spikes."
23-06-2019T07:47:08,AspiringNoodle,"Companies like Reddit, Crunchyroll, Amazon, etc."
23-06-2019T07:47:36,AspiringNoodle,Might be another DDoS on DNS.  Been a while too.
23-06-2019T07:48:52,AspiringNoodle,Ugh... now I'M the one who needs coffee... and I don't have any :ptv-unimpressed:

23-06-2019T07:52:34,TeapotOfDoom,DDOS on DNS you say?
23-06-2019T07:53:01,AspiringNoodle,I was reading about it on a site that miraculously wasn't down.  Apparently this happened ~2.5 years back
23-06-2019T07:53:18,TeapotOfDoom,Yeah I think I heard of that incident
23-06-2019T07:53:47,AspiringNoodle,"More or less someone wanted extra brownie points and decided to DDoS the backbone of the internet.  They didn't hate one site, they hated ALL the sites xD"
23-06-2019T07:54:01,TeapotOfDoom,"If you're suspicion is right, this won't be the last we've hear of this incident now"
23-06-2019T07:54:40,TeapotOfDoom,"Usually the DNS backbone get's used for DDOS attacks, not as the target"
23-06-2019T07:55:06,TeapotOfDoom,Ever heard of DNS amplification
23-06-2019T07:55:12,AspiringNoodle,Nope
23-06-2019T07:56:48,TeapotOfDoom,You send a DNS request with a field called response size of something of that sort. But you spoof the IP address of the sender to be your target instead of you. Then the DNS replies to the alleged sender with the requested response. And DNS is powerfull.
23-06-2019T07:57:06,TeapotOfDoom,It's like the entire internet wants to talk to you at once
23-06-2019T07:57:38,TeapotOfDoom,The last attack of this nature I heard about had several Gigabytes/sek of bandwidth
23-06-2019T07:57:55,TeapotOfDoom,That was a report by Cloudflare
23-06-2019T07:58:48,AspiringNoodle,"Luckily Newegg was down, so I was able to tentatively build a computer xD"
23-06-2019T07:58:51,AspiringNoodle,wasn't*
23-06-2019T07:58:59,AspiringNoodle,"Maybe a bit slow, but still up and running :P"
23-06-2019T07:59:12,TeapotOfDoom,What's the latest status?
23-06-2019T07:59:20,AspiringNoodle,Everything seems to be working fine
23-06-2019T07:59:47,TeapotOfDoom,What does Ookla say?
23-06-2019T08:00:24,AspiringNoodle,Haven't bothered <3
23-06-2019T08:10:25,CrimsonQuill,Hullo...

23-06-2019T08:11:12,TeapotOfDoom,QUILL

23-06-2019T08:11:58,CrimsonQuill,So...
23-06-2019T08:12:11,CrimsonQuill,Just how much have I missed over the past month?
23-06-2019T08:12:43,AspiringNoodle,Kitty Nora is a thing
23-06-2019T08:13:01,CrimsonQuill,It does seem to say so in my emails./...
23-06-2019T08:13:20,CrimsonQuill,"I haven't actually looked at the sketches yet, as I am re-reading the comic...again."
23-06-2019T08:13:29,CrimsonQuill,And would like to leave it until I am a little way in.
23-06-2019T08:13:35,CrimsonQuill,The wait is killing me...
23-06-2019T08:14:32,TeapotOfDoom,Well this month seems to be not the bussiest since there is a truckload of conventions
23-06-2019T08:15:12,CrimsonQuill,I see...
23-06-2019T08:15:20,CrimsonQuill,Anything new on the Keenspot Shop?
23-06-2019T08:25:11,TeapotOfDoom,I'm back to studying. Cya!
23-06-2019T08:25:33,CrimsonQuill,Cya!
23-06-2019T09:15:05,AspiringNoodle,"Oh god, this is about to be hilariously bad"
23-06-2019T09:15:21,AspiringNoodle,"So there's an overwatch event running right now, and I typically partake for the sake of it xD"
23-06-2019T09:15:42,AspiringNoodle,"But for now, my graphics are being run by my CPU's HD Graphics 4000"
23-06-2019T09:16:18,AspiringNoodle,"Overwatch's minimum system requirements list the 4400, but that's basically a MoE improvement.  Here's hoping I can play!"
23-06-2019T09:22:11,PotatoRights,Heres a question for you
23-06-2019T09:22:27,PotatoRights,"Who is more powerful, nora of tom?"
23-06-2019T09:23:41,AspiringNoodle,Think of that old Looney Tunes cartoon where Daffy was fighting with the animator :P
23-06-2019T09:24:52,PotatoRights,Nora is powerful
23-06-2019T09:24:58,PotatoRights,Daffy is not
23-06-2019T09:25:19,PotatoRights,May have to be a sketch suggestion if i could
23-06-2019T09:27:05,PotatoRights,"Also, have there been any time in the comic or sketches where they have broken the 4th wall?"
23-06-2019T09:31:12,PotatoRights,Besides tom being in the comic
23-06-2019T09:38:06,AspiringNoodle,...not that I can remember

23-06-2019T18:06:13,TeapotOfDoom,Guys I found out what knocked the internet offline today
23-06-2019T18:06:21,TeapotOfDoom,Night Terra btw
23-06-2019T18:07:43,TeapotOfDoom,Verizon decided to route their entire traffic through the servers of a small powerplant in Northern Pennsylvania
23-06-2019T18:08:48,TeapotOfDoom,Took half of the internet with it. Also expleins why Europe hasn't really noticed major problems. Cloudflare postet something on their blog
23-06-2019T18:09:16,Bgrmystr2,fuckin.. verizon. Wow
23-06-2019T18:09:40,TeapotOfDoom,That's what I call an epic fail
23-06-2019T18:13:20,TeapotOfDoom,I mean that's like rerouting a nine lane freeway through a garage driveway. Ain't gonna happen
23-06-2019T18:15:37,RimaDraws,hiiii
23-06-2019T18:18:02,TeapotOfDoom,Hi Rima
23-06-2019T18:18:32,RimaDraws,sup
23-06-2019T18:19:07,TeapotOfDoom,Internet in North America went down for about an hour today. So nothing much since I'm in Europe
23-06-2019T18:19:23,TeapotOfDoom,wbu
23-06-2019T18:20:28,RimaDraws,why did it go down?
23-06-2019T18:20:47,TeapotOfDoom,Verizon fucked up in a pretty epic way
23-06-2019T18:20:57,RimaDraws,just got home from the store and gym. oh boy? what did they do
23-06-2019T18:21:54,TeapotOfDoom,They rerouted their entire traffic through the servers of a small power plant. That's like trying to reroute a freeway through some small unpaved neighbourhood street
23-06-2019T18:22:42,TeapotOfDoom,The obvious followed. Took down their network. Halted half of the internet traffic
23-06-2019T18:22:43,RimaDraws,wow lol
23-06-2019T18:23:03,RimaDraws,i have verizon and i cant believe they screwed that up
23-06-2019T18:23:11,TeapotOfDoom,That's a pretty epic fail. We already speculated about a possible attack
23-06-2019T18:23:17,TeapotOfDoom,But nooo
23-06-2019T18:23:44,TeapotOfDoom,I think in hindsight that's pretty funny
23-06-2019T18:23:57,TeapotOfDoom,I wonder what the admins at the power plant were seing
23-06-2019T18:24:06,TeapotOfDoom,That must have been a truckload of traffix
23-06-2019T18:24:43,RimaDraws,lol big time
23-06-2019T18:25:42,TeapotOfDoom,Well it's already pretty late where I am. Just doing a bit of graphics work and then I will see myself to bed
23-06-2019T18:26:20,TeapotOfDoom,Still something planned for you?
23-06-2019T18:26:37,RimaDraws,drawing up comms
23-06-2019T18:26:44,RimaDraws,i got alot to finish
23-06-2019T18:29:42,TeapotOfDoom,Going to some conventions?
23-06-2019T18:29:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Mark. Locked Amy. Out of the house
23-06-2019T18:29:48,SpazztasticKiwi,AGAIN
23-06-2019T18:29:57,TeapotOfDoom,Or just usual work?
23-06-2019T18:30:16,TeapotOfDoom,You mean Mark I. Plier?
23-06-2019T18:30:22,SpazztasticKiwi,yep
23-06-2019T18:30:46,TeapotOfDoom,Isn't he home atm?
23-06-2019T18:31:57,SpazztasticKiwi,yep
23-06-2019T18:32:07,SpazztasticKiwi,and he accidentally locked Amy out
23-06-2019T18:32:09,SpazztasticKiwi,again
23-06-2019T18:32:44,SpazztasticKiwi,she apparently ended up spending the night in the van in the garage because he phone didn’t ring and he sleeps like the dead apparently
23-06-2019T18:33:06,SpazztasticKiwi,"he, and I quote him “fucked up”"
23-06-2019T18:34:33,SpazztasticKiwi,she’s a saint cause I’d be pissed for weeks
23-06-2019T18:35:51,TeapotOfDoom,Doesn't she have a key?
23-06-2019T18:36:03,TeapotOfDoom,Well i bet he got his share of trouble
23-06-2019T18:36:40,SpazztasticKiwi,she has a key. It was left inside cause she left it behind for the Austin trip
23-06-2019T18:37:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Mark says he woke up to ten missed calls and multiple texts
23-06-2019T18:37:24,TeapotOfDoom,oh shit
23-06-2019T18:37:47,SpazztasticKiwi,I can pick some locks. I’d have gotten in and dumped a bucket of ice on him
23-06-2019T18:38:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Well not really perhaps
23-06-2019T18:38:50,SpazztasticKiwi,but I have a feeling that he feels even worse because she’s not mad
23-06-2019T18:39:16,TeapotOfDoom,Pick locks? Sick
23-06-2019T18:39:27,TeapotOfDoom,Why'd you need keys then anyway?
23-06-2019T18:39:46,TeapotOfDoom,I bet you. I'd feel horrible
23-06-2019T18:41:21,SpazztasticKiwi,he’s apparently promised her a vacation
23-06-2019T18:42:13,SpazztasticKiwi,he’s an idiot but not a complete one
23-06-2019T18:44:57,TeapotOfDoom,Well I'd sleep one night in a van if I get a vacation in return
23-06-2019T18:45:14,TeapotOfDoom,But I think everyone profits from this
23-06-2019T18:45:23,TeapotOfDoom,They get to go on vacation
23-06-2019T18:46:07,TeapotOfDoom,I just noticed i had selection smoothing turned off in ps. That's why my last attempt looked so rough
23-06-2019T18:46:53,TeapotOfDoom,and i mispositioned the image
23-06-2019T18:47:00,TeapotOfDoom,well time to start over

23-06-2019T18:57:11,TeapotOfDoom,Say is there a stickerpack of the TK emotes?
23-06-2019T18:57:59,Twokinds,"No, but that might be neat!"
23-06-2019T18:58:13,Twokinds,If only I could somehow print animated stickers.
23-06-2019T18:58:37,TeapotOfDoom,Haha now that would be a feat of engineering

23-06-2019T19:19:52,RimaDraws,not much just doing some things
23-06-2019T19:20:00,Twokinds,Thinking of making a poll
23-06-2019T19:20:11,RimaDraws,poll?
23-06-2019T19:23:15,Twokinds,It's where you ask people their opinions in survey form
23-06-2019T19:23:55,RimaDraws,yea i know. is it for the stream next week or ?

23-06-2019T19:25:57,SpazztasticKiwi,so unbelievably excited for a piece of cinnamon cake
23-06-2019T19:25:57,TeapotOfDoom,Now that's just cute
23-06-2019T19:26:12,SpazztasticKiwi,I wish I had that energy
23-06-2019T19:26:36,SpazztasticKiwi,"It was precious. Jumping around, chanting “cake cake cake”"
23-06-2019T19:26:42,Ordithus,d'aww
23-06-2019T19:26:52,Twokinds,I'd like to know what kind of relationship dynamics people are interested in.
23-06-2019T19:26:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Meanwhile her sibling was like “are we related?”
23-06-2019T19:27:38,TeapotOfDoom,lol
23-06-2019T19:29:10,Ordithus,Not sure how you'd really ask that
23-06-2019T19:30:01,Twokinds,I just want to know if people would prefer male human with female anthro or female human with male anthro
23-06-2019T19:30:18,Ordithus,"Ah, that's a fairly straightforward one"
23-06-2019T19:30:21,AspiringNoodle,Or male anthro with female feral? ;D

23-06-2019T19:30:33,SpazztasticKiwi,as long as they’re not dicks to each other I don’t have any preference
23-06-2019T19:30:42,Ordithus,I though you meant something having to do with the personalities
23-06-2019T19:31:06,Ordithus,How about female human with female dunno? :ctwokinds-RainezZz:

23-06-2019T19:36:22,TeapotOfDoom,You talking about turning Sythe into a human and Maren into a cat? Or the more obvious but hopeless couple?

23-06-2019T19:38:02,iliar,About Human Male x Anthro Female vs Anthro Male x Human Female. I like both options. I can not give preference to one.

23-06-2019T19:39:01,TeapotOfDoom,Oooohhh
23-06-2019T19:39:22,SpazztasticKiwi,depends on who you want to attract to the story
23-06-2019T19:39:41,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-statuerawr: why are lizards excluded (not serious or am I)
23-06-2019T19:40:00,TeapotOfDoom,Well still I have no preference. Like I said cuteness is everything that's really needed ^^
23-06-2019T19:40:03,TeapotOfDoom,lol ord
23-06-2019T19:40:34,SpazztasticKiwi,you got the male dynamic down and a good bit of the female - how you place them and direct them will determine who you lure
23-06-2019T19:40:57,SpazztasticKiwi,the characters that it - how you place and direct them
23-06-2019T19:41:39,RimaDraws,oooh new characters
23-06-2019T19:42:39,Ordithus,"The characters come first.  If at the end of the day, you come up with a male cat you like that fits well with a lady hooman, the overall species thing doesn't really matter"
23-06-2019T19:42:55,Ordithus,Or whoever you come up with
23-06-2019T19:43:08,TeapotOfDoom,Agreed. Character is definitely more important
23-06-2019T19:43:56,SpazztasticKiwi,whatever is made will attract someone
23-06-2019T19:44:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"if it’s a real debate, flip a coin"
23-06-2019T19:45:07,TeapotOfDoom,I'm gonna head to bed. I've been up for way to long especially considering when I have to get up again... G'night yall!

23-06-2019T19:45:26,iliar,"About Human x Canine vs Human x Feline. I don't know why, but I prefer to see Canine as Male, Feline as Female. So if Human is Male then prefer Feline. If Human is Female then prefer Canine."
23-06-2019T19:45:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Nat/Keith Flora/Trace both have my investment and for different reasons
23-06-2019T19:46:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I can see a human female with a male feline like “you have to stop laying in my lap. I can’t feel my legs”
23-06-2019T19:46:34,Ordithus,"iliar, I can see that being cats are generally seen as more feminine and dogs more masculine?"

23-06-2019T19:51:56,Ordithus,Are you saying dogs aren't?

23-06-2019T19:55:32,Bgrmystr2,I don't see cats excited to go for walks or to catch balls or going outside to do.. anything. xD
23-06-2019T19:55:41,Bgrmystr2,other than laze about in the sun.
23-06-2019T19:56:20,Bgrmystr2,"and then dogs sleep cuz they're tired, and then wake up and turn their energy up to 11 all over again."
23-06-2019T19:56:37,iliar,But I think this is not the rule. I think the characters can be absolutely any races. In absolutely any combination. For me it is more important how you build their relationship.
23-06-2019T19:56:44,iliar,"Although perhaps there is one rule, a pair of different characters look interesting."
23-06-2019T19:57:21,Bgrmystr2,"yeah I think anyone can be with anyone else, but the personality of the person is what fuels the shippers in the fandom."

23-06-2019T20:02:14,iliar,Fun fact. I ordered some fan art from Tsukinori. She doesn't like to draw Anthro x Human. Even simple things like kisses. This immediately makes impossible many ideas for fan art. Because Tom has a lot of Anthro x Human pairs.

23-06-2019T20:06:38,Ordithus,yeah Tom does like to have his characters break boundaries
23-06-2019T20:07:17,Dadrobit,Just binged Tsukinori and found Nora. Was that it?

23-06-2019T20:11:11,SpazztasticKiwi,corroded all to hell. Guess what year it was installed

23-06-2019T20:17:20,AspiringNoodle,It seems stuck in that zone between light detail and heavy detail.
