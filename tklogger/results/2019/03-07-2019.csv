03-07-2019T00:00:20,AspiringNoodle,"But artistic decisions aside, afterwards I've come to hate the lore surrounding that scene because it completely invalidates all space warfare"
03-07-2019T00:00:23,Dadrobit,I really liked Rogue One at least. Haven't seen any of the other standalone movies besides though.
03-07-2019T00:00:31,AspiringNoodle,Rogue One so good <3
03-07-2019T00:00:41,Ordithus,Indeed
03-07-2019T00:00:44,AspiringNoodle,Love me a good bad / bitersweet ending from time to time
03-07-2019T00:00:50,Ordithus,K2 <3
03-07-2019T00:01:23,AspiringNoodle,"btw, things are not looking good"
03-07-2019T00:01:32,AspiringNoodle,Extra Credits typically gains 400 - 850 subs a day
03-07-2019T00:01:41,Dadrobit,The romance was a bit forced (pardon the pun) but I thought the rest really stood up well.
03-07-2019T00:01:42,AspiringNoodle,"They lost 4,209 yesterday"
03-07-2019T00:01:48,AspiringNoodle,And they're already on 301 for today :/
03-07-2019T00:09:46,Bgrmystr2,Just gonna note that I just watched that ep of extra credits and I just.. It talked a fucking lot but in the end told me basically nothing.
03-07-2019T00:10:13,AspiringNoodle,"Other than they used a shit ton of mental gymnastics, ridiculous assumptions, and outdated arguments?"
03-07-2019T00:10:31,Bgrmystr2,I kinda ignored a lot of that.
03-07-2019T00:10:35,Ordithus,Evenin' bgr :ctwokinds-floAAA:
03-07-2019T00:10:38,Bgrmystr2,hey ord.
03-07-2019T00:10:53,AspiringNoodle,Ord and I just had a long discussion about that video
03-07-2019T00:11:00,Bgrmystr2,Yes I was here for that.
03-07-2019T00:11:09,AspiringNoodle,...you lurkin'?
03-07-2019T00:11:11,Ordithus,It was 95% whispers
03-07-2019T00:11:22,Ordithus,"So, no, you were not :P"
03-07-2019T00:11:27,Bgrmystr2,well I was here for the 5% that wasn't whispers.
03-07-2019T00:11:29,Bgrmystr2,so technically
03-07-2019T00:11:37,AspiringNoodle,You hear that Ord?
03-07-2019T00:11:41,AspiringNoodle,He was eavesdropping
03-07-2019T00:11:42,AspiringNoodle,So rude
03-07-2019T00:11:43,Bgrmystr2,"and to be fair, I was here before either of you came on. xD"
03-07-2019T00:11:45,Bgrmystr2,so yes
03-07-2019T00:11:47,Bgrmystr2,I lurk.
03-07-2019T00:12:00,Ordithus,"Alwaaaaays watching,"
03-07-2019T00:12:26,Bgrmystr2,Allllllways watching Wazaowski :ptv-SteelwormHades:
03-07-2019T00:12:37,Ordithus,I liked that the video made me think.
03-07-2019T00:12:47,Bgrmystr2,same
03-07-2019T00:13:00,Bgrmystr2,but I don't know if I agree with it.
03-07-2019T00:13:05,Ordithus,"A lot of what they said was very flawed, but meh.  Don't have to agree 100%"
03-07-2019T00:13:26,Ordithus,EC does love to shoot for the moon
03-07-2019T00:13:33,Bgrmystr2,We should be allowed to make our own decisions on how a game affects us and whether we change due to what we see on it.
03-07-2019T00:13:40,Bgrmystr2,the game changes nothing.
03-07-2019T00:13:51,AspiringNoodle,"The problem is that their argument was a commonly agreed sentinment, nazis / terrorists are bad, don't make them look good."
03-07-2019T00:14:08,AspiringNoodle,But instead of focusing on single player games where story / context play a huge role
03-07-2019T00:14:26,Bgrmystr2,I doubt the game makes them look good. But that's irrelevant since you can bet that the Nazis in Germany actually thought they were the good guys.
03-07-2019T00:14:28,Bgrmystr2,Everyone does.
03-07-2019T00:14:33,AspiringNoodle,"They decided to sledgehammer a square peg into a round hole, and shoehorn all the negative stigma around them into multiplayer, where 0 of that context exists"
03-07-2019T00:15:03,AspiringNoodle,And made assumptions about how gamers think / feel when playing these types of games.
03-07-2019T00:15:33,Bgrmystr2,"I do at least agree with them that if the game's supposed to be historically accurate, make it accurate. At least try a little."
03-07-2019T00:15:41,AspiringNoodle,^
03-07-2019T00:16:10,AspiringNoodle,"That said, we bend the rules of what's ""realistic"" for the sake of game feel"
03-07-2019T00:16:39,AspiringNoodle,"If we were only limited to 3 or so guns per side per map, the game wouldn't feel good, even if it was historically accurate"
03-07-2019T00:16:44,Bgrmystr2,there's games about all sorts of taboos. I do not think Nazis are any more special than any other taboo commonly known by the populous.
03-07-2019T00:16:58,Dadrobit,"That, and it's an FPS yeah? To the Nazi players, all thyleyre seeing is a gun shooting whatever else factions are in the game. And for everyone else, they get to shoot Nazis."
03-07-2019T00:17:06,AspiringNoodle,It's the revival of pearl clutching
03-07-2019T00:17:17,AspiringNoodle,"Only now it's the people making the games who are doing the clutching, hahahahaha"
03-07-2019T00:17:18,Dadrobit,They're*
03-07-2019T00:17:26,SpazztasticKiwi,🍿
03-07-2019T00:17:38,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, it's a thing kiwi"
03-07-2019T00:18:13,Ordithus,:popcorn:[nom]*:ctwokinds-statuerawr:
03-07-2019T00:18:15,Bgrmystr2,I think I'm just gonna ignore it and move on. They kinda lost me a long time ago
03-07-2019T00:18:21,AspiringNoodle,I'm now actually interested to see a game  that does WWII as realistically as possible :P
03-07-2019T00:18:40,Ordithus,"WWII online, it's dead"
03-07-2019T00:18:50,Dadrobit,Swap the Nazis out for literally any other characters and it's exactly the same experience. It's not like we got upset at BF4 for glorifying being a Chinese commie shooting Westerners in a modern setting...
03-07-2019T00:18:51,Ordithus,Had no $$$
03-07-2019T00:19:26,AspiringNoodle,"Bgr, what I hate is when games cover these controversial topics, then bend the knee to the outrage mob"
03-07-2019T00:19:32,Dadrobit,It's about as pointless a point one could make.
03-07-2019T00:20:07,AspiringNoodle,"Also, I think an ultra-realistic WWII shooter would be HORRIBLE."
03-07-2019T00:20:19,Dadrobit,"Be back in a bit, phone call."
03-07-2019T00:20:21,Ordithus,"The ""outrage mob"" seems significantly smaller than people complaining about the outrage mob"
03-07-2019T00:20:31,AspiringNoodle,That is true
03-07-2019T00:20:48,AspiringNoodle,"However, they tend to scream the loudest, and thus appear the most prevalent in the eyes of people making products and decisions"
03-07-2019T00:21:14,Ordithus,Unsure of that
03-07-2019T00:21:24,AspiringNoodle,"And I'd like to think that the ""silent majority"" is finally tired of letting them have their way :P"
03-07-2019T00:21:24,Ordithus,"I see that said, a lot"
03-07-2019T00:21:26,Bgrmystr2,I think both sides are kinda stupid since the ones that scream the loudest of both sides usually have not a fuck of clue what they're talkin about.
03-07-2019T00:21:45,Bgrmystr2,people who know what they're doin usually stay out of it because it's fucking suicide to pick a side lol
03-07-2019T00:21:53,Ordithus,Almost like there's nuance to things
03-07-2019T00:22:12,AspiringNoodle,The smart ones use the outrage mob as free advertising ;)
03-07-2019T00:22:18,Bgrmystr2,the silent majority will never speak up
03-07-2019T00:22:24,Bgrmystr2,that's one thing you can be sure of
03-07-2019T00:22:32,Bgrmystr2,because they don't bother with it
03-07-2019T00:23:08,AspiringNoodle,Remember Kingdom Come Deliverance?
03-07-2019T00:23:12,Ordithus,Nope
03-07-2019T00:23:24,AspiringNoodle,It was a game that the outrage mob came for
03-07-2019T00:23:52,AspiringNoodle,"The developers gave them the finger, and used it as free advertising.  For an indie game, it sold crazy good."
03-07-2019T00:30:48,Ordithus,"If art causes critical thinking, good.  I do say that not knowing the specifics of that game, though."
03-07-2019T00:31:38,AspiringNoodle,I think it's an RPG at heart
03-07-2019T00:32:02,AspiringNoodle,The game takes place in Medeival Bohemia.  You play as the son of a blacksmith who ends up becoming a soldier
03-07-2019T00:32:43,Ordithus,"You don't have to go in detail.  It's 12:30, I'm tired.  I'm not going to take this in, sorry."
03-07-2019T00:33:03,Ordithus,Glad to have had a good discussion tonight
03-07-2019T00:33:27,AspiringNoodle,All I remember for sure is that they didn't like that the game only had white people :P
03-07-2019T00:33:36,AspiringNoodle,"I'm sure there were other things, but that was a big one."
03-07-2019T00:36:35,AspiringNoodle,*sigh* I hate politics...
03-07-2019T00:36:52,AspiringNoodle,"What's the saying?  ""You may not care about politics, but politics cares about you""?"
03-07-2019T00:51:31,Dadrobit,"Back, ""Lt. Dadrobit! Will you PLEASE do something about these fireworks?!?!"""
03-07-2019T00:51:49,Dadrobit,"Uhhhh, yeah buddy, I'll get right on that."
03-07-2019T00:52:20,Ordithus,"""Yeah, I'll get to it.  Clearly they need more, louder fireworks"""
03-07-2019T00:52:29,Dadrobit,Dude was very upset that his dogs wouldn't stop barking at the fireworks.
03-07-2019T00:53:19,Dadrobit,"Long story short. ""If you can accurately pinpoint where exactly the fireworks are coming from, then by all means call the cops."""
03-07-2019T00:53:54,SpazztasticKiwi,“do something about the fireworks”?
03-07-2019T00:54:03,SpazztasticKiwi,"very well, out come the bombs"

03-07-2019T00:54:30,Dadrobit,Couple years back they wanted me to do something about an earthquake. People aren't always the brightest.

03-07-2019T00:55:18,Dadrobit,Implying I'm not already.
03-07-2019T00:56:26,SpazztasticKiwi,“it’s flattering you think I’m hot enough to be godly”
03-07-2019T00:57:57,Ordithus,"""Oops, sorry, that was my fault.  Taco Bell last night"""
03-07-2019T01:00:29,Dadrobit,"To be fair, fireworks outside of the night of the 4th are forbidden, and it's straight up illegal as shit with our fire risk. But realistically I can do very little."
03-07-2019T01:00:43,Dadrobit,Forbidden by the HOA*
03-07-2019T01:01:31,Dadrobit,I have all the legal authority of a sentient lemon meringue pie. Best I can do is ask nicely and then threaten to call the police.
03-07-2019T01:02:18,SpazztasticKiwi,why lemon meringue?
03-07-2019T01:02:57,Dadrobit,"Because it's an acquired taste, like me. :D"
03-07-2019T01:03:45,SpazztasticKiwi,delicate balance

03-07-2019T06:29:27,CrimsonQuill,Never seen PackHunter
03-07-2019T08:22:24,AspiringNoodle,I believe a day will come when a new connector will be made just for aRGB fans.
03-07-2019T08:22:51,AspiringNoodle,One that will deliver power AND allow for custom control of the lighting.
03-07-2019T12:32:27,AspiringNoodle,"No, that'll screw my sleep schedule up even more"
03-07-2019T12:33:09,IronHorseComics,"you don't have to sleep for long, just take a nap"
03-07-2019T12:33:39,AspiringNoodle,"Believe me, that ""nap"" will turn into a 6 hour endeavor"
03-07-2019T12:33:46,AspiringNoodle,And then I'm back to square 0
03-07-2019T12:34:17,IronHorseComics,this is what alarm clocks are fore

03-07-2019T12:36:55,IronHorseComics,are you one of those people that sleeps through alarm clocks?
03-07-2019T12:37:31,AspiringNoodle,I can.  I'm not exactly known for quality sleep
03-07-2019T12:37:51,AspiringNoodle,So it's likely that after all the wakeups at night I could end up being in the middle of a sleep cycle when an alarm goes off
03-07-2019T12:38:16,IronHorseComics,I see
03-07-2019T12:38:54,AspiringNoodle,*watches video about pokemon*

03-07-2019T12:40:04,AspiringNoodle,I wonder if my saves are not corrupted
03-07-2019T12:40:14,AspiringNoodle,Been a while since I've touched them :p
03-07-2019T12:40:50,IronHorseComics,they shouldn't be
03-07-2019T12:45:35,AspiringNoodle,I imagine saves on old games cartridges are similar to non-volatile flash storage
03-07-2019T12:45:59,AspiringNoodle,Even for things like DS cartridges.  Meaning they don't have the greatest long-term viability without a rewrite every once in a while.
03-07-2019T12:46:41,AspiringNoodle,I would hate to boot up pokemon black and lose my Zoroark :(

03-07-2019T15:48:19,CrimsonQuill,I'm off to bed.
03-07-2019T15:48:24,CrimsonQuill,Goodnight all.

03-07-2019T15:56:12,AspiringNoodle,Ryan Reynolds Bottle Cap Challenge: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VCPj5F7z7I
03-07-2019T15:56:26,AspiringNoodle,I'm dying :joy:
03-07-2019T16:40:08,IronHorseComics,I knew it was gonna go wrong the moment he started the roundhouse kick
03-07-2019T16:40:17,IronHorseComics,I was not disappointed
03-07-2019T17:20:20,SpazztasticKiwi,y’all
03-07-2019T17:20:27,SpazztasticKiwi,July ribs
03-07-2019T17:20:33,SpazztasticKiwi,tater salad
03-07-2019T17:20:38,SpazztasticKiwi,coleslaw and beans
03-07-2019T17:20:44,SpazztasticKiwi,And now I’m doing the walk
03-07-2019T17:21:06,SpazztasticKiwi,starting to think it’s not the best plan
03-07-2019T17:21:32,IronHorseComics,I grilled myself a couple of hotdogs
03-07-2019T17:21:42,IronHorseComics,that was enough for me
03-07-2019T17:25:09,AspiringNoodle,My dad ordered so much fried chicken that it came in a giant styrofoam cooler :ptv-unimpressed:
03-07-2019T17:25:36,TeapotOfDoom,Mmmmm
03-07-2019T17:25:39,TeapotOfDoom,Nice
03-07-2019T17:26:24,AspiringNoodle,Yeah... I don't feel like eating fried chicken 3x a day for the next 2 weeks straight
03-07-2019T17:26:32,AspiringNoodle,He has a problem with ordering WAAAAAAAAAAAAY too much food.
03-07-2019T17:27:18,TeapotOfDoom,Hahaha just saw the video
03-07-2019T17:27:40,TeapotOfDoom,He's just getting outa there xD
03-07-2019T17:28:11,TeapotOfDoom,Also is it already done or still to be fried?
03-07-2019T17:28:31,AspiringNoodle,It's all cooked
03-07-2019T17:28:44,TeapotOfDoom,Also happy bday to Mihari. If someone actually finds her
03-07-2019T17:29:00,TeapotOfDoom,Oh then you can't even freeze it
03-07-2019T17:29:48,IronHorseComics,yeah that's annoying
03-07-2019T17:29:51,AspiringNoodle,Oh we can...
03-07-2019T17:29:54,AspiringNoodle,We will...
03-07-2019T17:30:11,AspiringNoodle,I have a love-hate relationship with takeout around here
03-07-2019T17:30:14,AspiringNoodle,Love the food
03-07-2019T17:30:25,AspiringNoodle,Hate that he basically doubles the bill on top of what should be reasonable
03-07-2019T17:30:38,TeapotOfDoom,Lol
03-07-2019T17:30:40,AspiringNoodle,Say $15 is enough for 1 - 2 meals.
03-07-2019T17:30:49,AspiringNoodle,So the bill *should* come out to around $45
03-07-2019T17:30:56,AspiringNoodle,"Nope, $90+"
03-07-2019T17:30:59,TeapotOfDoom,Wow
03-07-2019T17:31:15,IronHorseComics,"tell me, was he poor growing up?"
03-07-2019T17:31:21,AspiringNoodle,"Yes, yes he was."
03-07-2019T17:31:27,IronHorseComics,"yep, that explains it"
03-07-2019T17:31:32,TeapotOfDoom,Now that's actually an acomplishment as I would say
03-07-2019T17:32:05,AspiringNoodle,Definitely not poverty level poor
03-07-2019T17:32:08,IronHorseComics,"see when people grow up in poverty, they feel like they have to hoard everything they get, even if they find themselves in upperclass"
03-07-2019T17:32:30,IronHorseComics,my dad is like that but he doesn't buy 2 weeks worth of food
03-07-2019T17:32:50,AspiringNoodle,"But down there enough that when money become temporarily plentiful, they would buy a small cache and store it."
03-07-2019T17:33:07,AspiringNoodle,Mom and I have been trying to break this for years
03-07-2019T17:33:09,IronHorseComics,"he keeps a lot of stuff that needs to be thrown away, none of it is traditional trash but he doesn't like throwing something away, especially if he thinks he can fix it"
03-07-2019T17:33:27,TeapotOfDoom,Good call
03-07-2019T17:33:37,AspiringNoodle,We recently FINALLY cleared out the freezer of food that's no longer good
03-07-2019T17:33:51,AspiringNoodle,"I'm on the opposite end, though xD"
03-07-2019T17:34:07,TeapotOfDoom,I thought about fixing an old tube radio i destroyed while being a bit over enthusiastic about my repair skills
03-07-2019T17:34:08,AspiringNoodle,I'll stock up and then consume everything before making another trip to the store :P
03-07-2019T17:34:27,IronHorseComics,"I'm a bit like that, sometimes I forget to eat it though"
03-07-2019T17:34:30,AspiringNoodle,"That said, I've been out of bagels and apples for about a week xD"
03-07-2019T17:34:44,AspiringNoodle,Probably 2.  My sleep schedule's been a complete wreck
03-07-2019T17:34:46,TeapotOfDoom,Now that's a problem
03-07-2019T17:35:33,AspiringNoodle,So yeah
03-07-2019T17:35:42,TeapotOfDoom,I'm gonna get the radio case from the basement brb
03-07-2019T17:35:53,AspiringNoodle,Consider me irked that we probably have 3 - 4 gallon bags of chicken in the fridge / freezer -_-
03-07-2019T17:36:25,AspiringNoodle,"I'm just guessing, because earlier when he was bagging everything to go in the fridge so it wouldn't spoil, the entire lower shelf was filled, and I only saw the 2 bags of chicken up front"
03-07-2019T17:36:41,AspiringNoodle,So no idea if there was more behind that when he was continuing.
03-07-2019T17:37:34,AspiringNoodle,"It just drives me absolutely fucking crazy when he orders so much food that you KNOW we're gonna get sick of eating it after a few days for 1 - 2 meals a day, and the rest will need to go into the freezer until such a time we can be bothered to eat it"
03-07-2019T17:38:11,AspiringNoodle,"Fucking hell.  Take what you think we're gonna eat, half that, and if you think that's still not enough, half it again...."
03-07-2019T17:39:31,AspiringNoodle,Rant over.
03-07-2019T17:40:33,IronHorseComics,feel better?
03-07-2019T17:40:56,AspiringNoodle,"Yes, yes I do :3"
03-07-2019T17:41:16,IronHorseComics,"good, good"
03-07-2019T17:41:35,Bgrmystr2,least you know the dude knows better. The guy here does NOT know better so you can't even give him shit for it cuz he really thinks we'll go through that much food.
03-07-2019T17:41:50,Bgrmystr2,spends $500 a month in food and thinks he's contributing.
03-07-2019T17:41:56,Bgrmystr2,10/10
03-07-2019T17:42:25,Bgrmystr2,sometimes he spends $500 in ONE shopping trip. >.>
03-07-2019T17:42:26,IronHorseComics,O_o
03-07-2019T17:42:40,Bgrmystr2,and then does it again the next weekend
03-07-2019T17:42:53,AspiringNoodle,"So, I more or less buy food for myself"
03-07-2019T17:43:10,AspiringNoodle,"And when I do buy food, it's 1 - 2 months of food"
03-07-2019T17:43:20,IronHorseComics,:ptv-shock:
03-07-2019T17:43:28,AspiringNoodle,"When it's all gone, I do it again.  I don't think I've ever gone over $200 in a single trip"
03-07-2019T17:44:11,AspiringNoodle,"That said, I'll eventually start going to the store more frequently because I like apples and bagels, and those don't exactly have a long shelf life xD"
03-07-2019T17:44:14,IronHorseComics,I don't think I've ever seen my family go over $200 on a shopping trip for groceries
03-07-2019T17:44:41,AspiringNoodle,"Tbh, I've been eating a lot less (at least at home)."
03-07-2019T17:45:00,AspiringNoodle,It's gotten to the point that the money I've set aside for errands has bloated
03-07-2019T17:45:08,IronHorseComics,"me too, but that's mainly because I'm too lazy to cook"
03-07-2019T17:45:18,AspiringNoodle,#FrozenDinnerLyfe
03-07-2019T17:45:27,IronHorseComics,I just go through a drive thru on the way home from work
03-07-2019T17:45:47,AspiringNoodle,"If I make enough, maaaaaaaaaybe I'll do that :P"
03-07-2019T17:46:03,AspiringNoodle,"As it stands, my frozen dinners are rather sizable and only cost me $3 a piece."
03-07-2019T17:46:58,TeapotOfDoom,Well I go to the store pretty much every day. I've get the opposite policy. If i only buy what i need that day it wont spoil. Also i always have what i want
03-07-2019T17:47:11,SpazztasticKiwi,baby powder sure is good for rubby bits and keeping you from smelling like wet dog but it also makes you look like a cocaine addict
03-07-2019T17:47:19,IronHorseComics,I make enough to where doing that twice a day (I do it during lunch too) won't hurt me too much. Well actually three times because I go into a hardees/McDonalds/local doughnut shop/ every morning on my way to work
03-07-2019T17:48:09,AspiringNoodle,"Living the dream, lol"
03-07-2019T17:48:16,TeapotOfDoom,Get some friends to come over and make some lines. When they ask about them just use the powder for something
03-07-2019T17:48:19,AspiringNoodle,"""I eat out all day, e'ry day!"""
03-07-2019T17:48:22,IronHorseComics,I don't spend money on much else though
03-07-2019T17:48:42,IronHorseComics,maybe an impulse buy here and there but still
03-07-2019T17:48:59,TeapotOfDoom,Chocolates might be the death of me
03-07-2019T17:49:17,TeapotOfDoom,Especially stacked coockies
03-07-2019T17:49:42,AspiringNoodle,I'm actually getting a bit tired of eating out xD
03-07-2019T17:49:48,TeapotOfDoom,Also this radio s gonna be a hell a lota work
03-07-2019T17:49:52,AspiringNoodle,I should really get those bagels / cream cheese
03-07-2019T17:50:01,AspiringNoodle,Sometimes those are enough of a splurge meal for me :P
03-07-2019T17:50:09,SpazztasticKiwi,I figured there’d be a ton of people at the park but there’s like three sitting doing nothing and a whiff of ribs
03-07-2019T17:50:40,SpazztasticKiwi,maybe 5 cars on the road as traffic
03-07-2019T17:51:02,IronHorseComics,everyone's either at home or visiting family
03-07-2019T17:51:21,IronHorseComics,"but they're all grill'n, when I walked my dog I could smell the grilled burgers for days"
03-07-2019T17:51:22,TeapotOfDoom,Heard theres a party over the pond
03-07-2019T17:51:42,IronHorseComics,"well yes, it's Independence Day"
03-07-2019T17:52:19,TeapotOfDoom,I was not able to miss that actually. It's literally all over reddit
03-07-2019T17:52:48,SpazztasticKiwi,I did notice last night my hips have gotten smaller
03-07-2019T17:52:55,IronHorseComics,lol
03-07-2019T17:53:11,SpazztasticKiwi,we’ll see how that goes
03-07-2019T17:53:23,TeapotOfDoom,Seems like good ol murica kinda runs the internet. I've never seen any other country being so vocal about it
03-07-2019T17:53:49,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
03-07-2019T17:53:58,TeapotOfDoom,Night Terra!
03-07-2019T17:54:32,TeapotOfDoom,Also try converting a flippin tuba radio that you destroyed back into a tube radio but with bluetooth
03-07-2019T17:55:13,TeapotOfDoom,I'm just sitting in front of that thing and trying to figure out how to use the old control scheme
03-07-2019T17:56:21,TeapotOfDoom,There used to be a mechanical pulley inside to indicate the current frequency. Now i have to replicate that somehow
03-07-2019T17:57:16,Dadrobit,MURICA DAY BITCHES!
03-07-2019T17:57:34,AspiringNoodle,MURICAAAAAA! F*CK YEAAAAAAAH!
03-07-2019T17:57:39,Dadrobit,*Fireworks Intensifies*
03-07-2019T17:57:44,TeapotOfDoom,*pew pew pew*
03-07-2019T17:58:04,IronHorseComics,Com'n again to save the mutha f*ck'n day-eah
03-07-2019T17:58:08,Bgrmystr2,"lol, we had a war over it, Teapot. A big one."
03-07-2019T17:58:57,Dadrobit,The French are pretty stellar too for helping out
03-07-2019T17:59:24,Dadrobit,Even gave us a big ol statue
03-07-2019T18:00:00,IronHorseComics,then they basically made Vietnam OUR problem
03-07-2019T18:00:09,AspiringNoodle,If I remember correctly...
03-07-2019T18:01:22,AspiringNoodle,"Okay, yup, yup"
03-07-2019T18:01:29,AspiringNoodle,"1776, FREEDOM DAAAAAAAAY"
03-07-2019T18:01:36,AspiringNoodle,1789 French Revolution
03-07-2019T18:01:42,AspiringNoodle,1889 Lady Liberty
03-07-2019T18:01:46,AspiringNoodle,#History
03-07-2019T18:02:24,AspiringNoodle,It's ironic
03-07-2019T18:02:39,AspiringNoodle,The French helping us beat Britain eventually lead to them having their own revolution
03-07-2019T18:02:56,AspiringNoodle,Guess they felt left out being only a helping hand (a BIG one xD)
03-07-2019T18:03:44,IronHorseComics,and that revolution led to Napoleon
03-07-2019T18:04:50,TeapotOfDoom,Yeah i know. Nontheless murica s especially vocal about it. I mean compare it to i dunno serbia
03-07-2019T18:05:09,TeapotOfDoom,I mean yeah they re way smaller
03-07-2019T18:05:20,IronHorseComics,Serbia's also led to WW1
03-07-2019T18:05:27,TeapotOfDoom,I know
03-07-2019T18:05:38,AspiringNoodle,America is very patriotic :P
03-07-2019T18:05:43,AspiringNoodle,That is unless you're a self-hating white
03-07-2019T18:05:52,TeapotOfDoom,Lol wut
03-07-2019T18:06:05,AspiringNoodle,It was a fun little study
03-07-2019T18:06:28,AspiringNoodle,Liberal whites were the only group polled with an out-group bias (meaning they approve of other ethnicities / races more than their own)
03-07-2019T18:06:48,TeapotOfDoom,Why would you do that?
03-07-2019T18:07:05,AspiringNoodle,We're having a problem with some political extremism atm ^^;
03-07-2019T18:07:19,TeapotOfDoom,I kinda noticed
03-07-2019T18:07:25,IronHorseComics,because they watch'ed a lot of media that basically makes them think white people are evil and need to be exterminated
03-07-2019T18:07:27,TeapotOfDoom,Everyone seems to atm
03-07-2019T18:07:37,AspiringNoodle,It'll be resolved soon enough
03-07-2019T18:07:47,TeapotOfDoom,Hopefully
03-07-2019T18:07:48,AspiringNoodle,Be it by the enablers waking up or a mountain of bodies
03-07-2019T18:08:09,TeapotOfDoom,Our last administration got kicked out of office
03-07-2019T18:08:10,AspiringNoodle,"The former seems more likely.  The defenders / enablers are realizing, ""Oh shit... we let this go too far..."""
03-07-2019T18:08:50,AspiringNoodle,We're quickly approaching the point where only the crazies are supporting / defending the crazies
03-07-2019T18:08:54,TeapotOfDoom,Because a video appeared of our vice cancelor trying to sell media influence and construction contracts to some random russian chick
03-07-2019T18:09:02,AspiringNoodle,LOL
03-07-2019T18:09:04,AspiringNoodle,Awkwaaaaaaaaaaaaaard
03-07-2019T18:09:30,TeapotOfDoom,"Turns out the ""russian chick"" was an actress"
03-07-2019T18:09:36,AspiringNoodle,"Also, say what you want about lawyers, they get shit done."
03-07-2019T18:10:03,AspiringNoodle,And God help you if the opposing lawyer is working on principle
03-07-2019T18:10:06,TeapotOfDoom,Also they confessed about several high profile companies giving them money for the same reason
03-07-2019T18:10:29,AspiringNoodle,"Ah, I see, so corporate money is a no-no where you live?"
03-07-2019T18:10:46,TeapotOfDoom,If that's coupled with at least mild competence you're pretty fucked
03-07-2019T18:11:12,TeapotOfDoom,It is highly regulated. And it has to be transparent
03-07-2019T18:11:25,AspiringNoodle,One of America's biggest problems is corporate money in politics
03-07-2019T18:11:28,TeapotOfDoom,What he did was practically speaking corruption
03-07-2019T18:11:34,IronHorseComics,it's supposed to be illegal
03-07-2019T18:11:38,AspiringNoodle,"Legally, corporations are considered ""people"", and thus can donate to candidates :/"
03-07-2019T18:12:01,AspiringNoodle,"They donate hundreds of thousands of dollars to candidates during campaign season, then get ""favors"" in return."
03-07-2019T18:12:03,IronHorseComics,they also bribe regulators like mad
03-07-2019T18:12:16,TeapotOfDoom,Also yes its one of the biggest no no s ever
03-07-2019T18:12:30,AspiringNoodle,"On the bright side, we're probably on the verge of cleaning out congress"
03-07-2019T18:12:37,AspiringNoodle,The amount of white hair is... staggering
03-07-2019T18:12:55,IronHorseComics,When I was in a training room for a chemical medicine company I found that the FDA doesn't do its job a well as it should and they get paid off a lot
03-07-2019T18:13:08,TeapotOfDoom,Yeah well we have one young guy and i really dont trust him
03-07-2019T18:13:45,IronHorseComics,there's a few young people that I don't trust at all
03-07-2019T18:13:47,AspiringNoodle,"If the media stopped chasing rage bait / conspiracies, and covered shit like THAT, something may actually change."
03-07-2019T18:14:05,IronHorseComics,they won't because rage bait is what sells
03-07-2019T18:14:14,AspiringNoodle,It's also why they're dying
03-07-2019T18:14:14,Bgrmystr2,"If corporations are people, I'd like to see it's birth certificate and driver's licence so I know it's old enough to be scamming adults."
03-07-2019T18:14:19,TeapotOfDoom,Thing is he s really popular but also conservative as hell
03-07-2019T18:14:34,TeapotOfDoom,Good one bgr
03-07-2019T18:14:48,Bgrmystr2,"Hey, there are negatives to being people."
03-07-2019T18:14:49,IronHorseComics,then you'll get branded racist by the media
03-07-2019T18:14:50,AspiringNoodle,"yeah, I kind of what whatever court that made that decision to revisit it"
03-07-2019T18:15:07,AspiringNoodle,want*
03-07-2019T18:15:25,AspiringNoodle,Allowing corporations to donate to politicians is one of the biggest mistakes America ever made.
03-07-2019T18:15:30,Bgrmystr2,"Corporations think being branded as people is a good thing, wait till someone takes a proper big case with the negatives against the corp"
03-07-2019T18:15:39,Bgrmystr2,it comes with the territory.
03-07-2019T18:15:40,AspiringNoodle,They're too big and have too much power without exerting influence over policymakers :/
03-07-2019T18:16:06,TeapotOfDoom,They kinda make the rules at this point
03-07-2019T18:16:20,TeapotOfDoom,So how do you outsmart someone like that
03-07-2019T18:16:30,Bgrmystr2,"you think that was a choice we made, but I don't think it's that. It was simply never made illegal from the get-go"
03-07-2019T18:16:35,AspiringNoodle,"Well, if push comes to shove, we can always take up the 2nd and start over."
03-07-2019T18:16:45,Bgrmystr2,so there was no mistake in that there wasn't a decicion made towards it.
03-07-2019T18:16:50,TeapotOfDoom,Yes
03-07-2019T18:17:03,Bgrmystr2,just that the decision was not there to be made in the first place.
03-07-2019T18:17:08,Bgrmystr2,much worse than a mistake.
03-07-2019T18:17:11,TeapotOfDoom,That's why i m happy there were at least attempts made here
03-07-2019T18:17:35,AspiringNoodle,"If there's one thing history's proven, it's greed."
03-07-2019T18:17:49,AspiringNoodle,And it's why any pure economic ideology is bound to fail.
03-07-2019T18:18:10,TeapotOfDoom,"Also after the incident, regulations on donations to political parties were made even more severe"
03-07-2019T18:18:53,TeapotOfDoom,You have to factor it in. You cant just assume everyone s playing along or using their mind
03-07-2019T18:19:37,TeapotOfDoom,I would like to add either ignorance or stupidity to that list
03-07-2019T18:19:49,TeapotOfDoom,Whatever fits better
03-07-2019T18:20:03,AspiringNoodle,"Teapot, if your government ever has to start over, for the love of God, PUT IN A CONSTITUTION XD"
03-07-2019T18:20:42,TeapotOfDoom,You mean me writing it?
03-07-2019T18:20:59,AspiringNoodle,Or make sure that the group agrees to draft one.
03-07-2019T18:21:06,TeapotOfDoom,I really don't feel qualified for something like that
03-07-2019T18:21:43,TeapotOfDoom,Also we actually have one. Saved our ass pretty well after that recent incident
03-07-2019T18:21:56,AspiringNoodle,Oh good
03-07-2019T18:22:12,AspiringNoodle,"I look at places like Britain, and think, ""That's why we have 1A"""
03-07-2019T18:22:28,AspiringNoodle,Never let all laws be up to the whim of the current ruling power.
03-07-2019T18:23:43,Bgrmystr2,yeah having one person that has ultimate power is basically fucking suicide for a country
03-07-2019T18:23:52,AspiringNoodle,^
03-07-2019T18:23:53,Bgrmystr2,because eventually someone will take that place
03-07-2019T18:24:02,Bgrmystr2,and they will HATE EVERYONE ELSE.
03-07-2019T18:24:05,TeapotOfDoom,First administration terminated itself. After that a temporal administradion had to be assembled. That one got kicked by parliament which lead to our president appointing one. Which now has trust of parliament and is in office until further eletions in fa
03-07-2019T18:24:09,IronHorseComics,and yet that's how it was done for basically almost all of human history
03-07-2019T18:24:42,IronHorseComics,for better or worse...mostly worse
03-07-2019T18:24:42,AspiringNoodle,"If you have a set of rules in place that are extremely hard to change / remove, and someone violates the boundaries set by those rules, it might be time for revolution."
03-07-2019T18:24:52,TeapotOfDoom,*temporary
03-07-2019T18:24:57,TeapotOfDoom,Not temporal
03-07-2019T18:25:26,AspiringNoodle,It's interesting when you think about how the constitution's amendments work
03-07-2019T18:25:38,AspiringNoodle,"For the most part, they all enshrine negative rights"
03-07-2019T18:26:09,TeapotOfDoom,We seem to have some stuff about cab drivers in our constitution. Go figure
03-07-2019T18:26:25,IronHorseComics,...
03-07-2019T18:26:34,AspiringNoodle,...that is completely ridiculous / unnecessary...
03-07-2019T18:27:05,TeapotOfDoom,A constitution is not the windows registry. You cant just put random stuff in there
03-07-2019T18:27:13,IronHorseComics,"hmmm, doesn't look like there's gonna be fireworks in my area, a storm's roll'n in"
03-07-2019T18:27:19,AspiringNoodle,Fundamentals only. Thank yooooooooouuuuuuuu
03-07-2019T18:27:41,AspiringNoodle,Ever wonder why the prohibition failed so hard? xD
03-07-2019T18:27:56,TeapotOfDoom,They somhow managed to get some of their law put into constitutional status
03-07-2019T18:28:05,IronHorseComics,"they didn't enforce it, all the cops got bribed and the states didn't want to pay for it"
03-07-2019T18:28:10,AspiringNoodle,"Start over, that constitution is already garbage"
03-07-2019T18:28:22,AspiringNoodle,I'm going for a more meta-level analysis :P
03-07-2019T18:28:35,TeapotOfDoom,Not really. As i said saved our asses two monthns ago
03-07-2019T18:28:46,AspiringNoodle,We basically amended the constitution in such a way that it was meant to snuff out an entire section of the market
03-07-2019T18:29:03,AspiringNoodle,Which inherently violated negative rights
03-07-2019T18:29:54,TeapotOfDoom,Also i think the fact that our last long term chancelor was a former cab driver could have something to do with the constitution status thing
03-07-2019T18:30:06,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-laugh:
03-07-2019T18:30:09,AspiringNoodle,OH MY GOD.
03-07-2019T18:30:27,AspiringNoodle,Well he's a dummy.
03-07-2019T18:30:44,IronHorseComics,"one thing I wish was more heavily regulated was internet advertising, it may seem strange for me to say as a graphic designer but having ads up the wazzu is absolutely ridiculous"
03-07-2019T18:31:07,TeapotOfDoom,He s policy of not doing anything is better than doing something wrong got us the current phase of populism
03-07-2019T18:31:22,AspiringNoodle,And that's why ad blockers exist :P
03-07-2019T18:31:42,TeapotOfDoom,Ublock origin solves your problems
03-07-2019T18:31:43,IronHorseComics,"well yes, but on apps like spotify, it doesn't work"
03-07-2019T18:32:04,TeapotOfDoom,Spotify premium solves your problems
03-07-2019T18:32:04,IronHorseComics,plus I had yet to find a good free one for my phone
03-07-2019T18:32:22,IronHorseComics,spotify premium is expensive
03-07-2019T18:32:32,TeapotOfDoom,Well depends
03-07-2019T18:32:59,TeapotOfDoom,I talked my mom into a family subscription. I pay 5 a month
03-07-2019T18:35:01,IronHorseComics,"wonder if I can cheese the system to get the 30 days trial, I don't want to have to mute the music tomorrow and forget about it because of four straight unskippable 30 second ads every five minutes"
03-07-2019T18:35:12,IronHorseComics,*during tomorrow's stream*
03-07-2019T18:35:44,TeapotOfDoom,How about using the monstercat vod?
03-07-2019T18:39:08,IronHorseComics,the what?
03-07-2019T18:40:03,TeapotOfDoom,The music label monstercat has a radio stream with all of their music which you can use fer streams
03-07-2019T18:40:47,TeapotOfDoom,I think that only applies to twitch but you just have to give them credit or something
03-07-2019T18:41:08,IronHorseComics,"hmmmm, no I'll just go with the free trial, I got playlists ready"
03-07-2019T18:42:07,TeapotOfDoom,Anyway i m really tired. Good night guys!
03-07-2019T18:42:44,IronHorseComics,laaater
03-07-2019T18:44:06,Dadrobit,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UP4_bMhZ4gA&t=7m48s damn, times have changed."
03-07-2019T18:45:07,IronHorseComics,yep
03-07-2019T18:45:16,IronHorseComics,I know exactly where you're going with that
03-07-2019T18:45:34,IronHorseComics,I had lost ALL of my respect for EC after that most recent video
03-07-2019T18:47:43,AspiringNoodle,"Haha, ord and I had a discussion about this yesterday"
03-07-2019T18:48:49,Dadrobit,Be back in a bit.
03-07-2019T18:49:38,IronHorseComics,I'm start'n to think these guys were the reason Dan left
03-07-2019T18:50:06,IronHorseComics,"he probably saw enough warning signs and was like ""NOPE, you're not getting ME caught in this shitshow"""
03-07-2019T18:50:16,AspiringNoodle,Aaaaaaand the ratio got worse
03-07-2019T18:50:25,AspiringNoodle,"Last I checked, it was 7.4k - 33k"
03-07-2019T18:50:35,AspiringNoodle,Now it's 9.8k - 64k
03-07-2019T18:50:40,IronHorseComics,ouch
03-07-2019T18:51:02,AspiringNoodle,I had 3 main gripes with the video
03-07-2019T18:51:17,AspiringNoodle,The implication that German soldiers in WWII supported Nazi ideology
03-07-2019T18:51:34,AspiringNoodle,"The rehashed use of ""violent video games cause violence"" argument"
03-07-2019T18:51:46,IronHorseComics,something they themselves argued against
03-07-2019T18:51:59,AspiringNoodle,Shoving the real world stigma into multiplayer where all important context is nonexistant
03-07-2019T18:52:37,AspiringNoodle,A *meh* 4th would be that people give a shit about playing as a nazi / terrorist / etc. in a multiplayer game.
03-07-2019T18:53:03,AspiringNoodle,But yeah... dear god that video is BAD
03-07-2019T18:53:07,IronHorseComics,"and plus, playing nazis can be a lot of fun, we get to act like supervillains and nobody will think we're being historically inaccurate"
03-07-2019T18:53:12,Bgrmystr2,"oh, is that why someone else was speaking on it?"
03-07-2019T18:53:13,Bgrmystr2,Dan left?
03-07-2019T18:53:22,AspiringNoodle,He left a while back
03-07-2019T18:53:30,Bgrmystr2,"I don't know, I haven't watched it in years lol"
03-07-2019T18:53:31,IronHorseComics,"yeah, he's been gone, for almost a year"
03-07-2019T18:53:35,AspiringNoodle,I liked the new guy because he brought Zoe onboard
03-07-2019T18:53:48,Bgrmystr2,"they got caught up with the SJW shit, and I noped otu"
03-07-2019T18:53:50,Bgrmystr2,out* even
03-07-2019T18:53:52,IronHorseComics,something about him kinda rubs me the wrong way
03-07-2019T18:53:58,AspiringNoodle,"Now I'm wondering, ""Who the hell is responsible for this script???"""
03-07-2019T18:54:12,IronHorseComics,their community manager is one of my suspects

03-07-2019T18:55:55,AspiringNoodle,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAND it got even worse
03-07-2019T18:56:00,AspiringNoodle,"Yesterday they lose 4,209 subscribers"
03-07-2019T18:56:10,IronHorseComics,they had those BEFORE the video came up

03-07-2019T19:00:33,AspiringNoodle,"Been a subscriber for 7 years, and this video finally made me unsubscribe. It is just so horribly condescending, hypocritical, and poorly thought out."

03-07-2019T19:04:17,AspiringNoodle,"Oh god.. and her pronouns are ""they / them""..."
03-07-2019T19:04:42,IronHorseComics,at least she didn't use those stupid newage gender neutral ones

03-07-2019T19:06:54,Bgrmystr2,Lol.. you don't get to choose what pronoun you are called. It's called self-acceptance and growing the fuck up. Adults aren't children.
