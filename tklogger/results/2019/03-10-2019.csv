03-10-2019T07:46:01,BadFoMo,@WINDOWS98SE Would Laura appearing as a ghost reset your counter?
03-10-2019T08:12:09,WINDOWS98SE,You mean if she's drawn as a ghost in a sketch?  Yeah.
03-10-2019T08:12:31,WINDOWS98SE,"I mean, I still prefer seeing her alive, but ghost form's OK too."

03-10-2019T13:44:54,Twokinds,"Just to let everyone know, I'm not interested in continuing with Walking in on Clovis pt 4, 5, 6, etc"
03-10-2019T13:45:14,Twokinds,"Let's leave some things to the imagination, please. Thank you."
03-10-2019T13:46:35,iliar,Doubt your ability to use censorship?
03-10-2019T13:48:08,Twokinds,It's starting to cross into fanfiction OCs. The purpose of sketch suggestions is not to collaboratively write Twokinds.
03-10-2019T13:48:26,Twokinds,"I want to actually have Clovis and Brutus be real characters in Twokinds, and the suggestions are kind of stepping on it now."
03-10-2019T13:49:42,Twokinds,People get a little too excited.
03-10-2019T13:51:09,iliar,"Hm. In this case, I want to remind you that Maren х Raine and Maeve х Madelyn are also real characters."
03-10-2019T13:52:52,iliar,"I understand that you like to tease people. But in that case, it would make sense to set a limit on these ships too."
03-10-2019T13:57:11,Twokinds,"I'm just saying, it's being taken a little far with some suggestions."
03-10-2019T14:02:31,iliar,"Okay. Fortunately, I am not particularly interested in this ship. Although the little Clovis together with big Brutus looks cute."
03-10-2019T14:04:57,Twokinds,I'm not saying no more Clovis and/or Brutus. Just no more bath!
03-10-2019T14:05:11,BadFoMo,Can you say how far?
03-10-2019T14:05:28,Twokinds,No.
03-10-2019T14:05:36,BadFoMo,Dang.
03-10-2019T14:06:31,BadFoMo,"Also, I can live with no more bath sketches."
03-10-2019T14:06:45,iliar,Yes. No bath. No preludes. Let's go to bed right now.
03-10-2019T14:12:20,Twokinds,"Yeeeeah, no."
03-10-2019T14:12:49,BadFoMo,"I fine with ditching beach, hot spring, and bedroom pinups too. I require /something/ wholesome or of substance. Anyone else with me or am I still alone?"
03-10-2019T14:15:49,BadFoMo,"@Twokinds Going off topic a bit, and while you're here, is my request ok?"
03-10-2019T14:17:23,Twokinds,I would message you if it was not.
03-10-2019T14:17:43,BadFoMo,Thanks.
03-10-2019T14:21:34,SpazztasticKiwi,last one looked like it was close enough to bedtime but with water to me
03-10-2019T14:21:53,SpazztasticKiwi,we need another Nibbly wave
03-10-2019T14:22:21,SpazztasticKiwi,BatNibbly with Sythe as Robin
03-10-2019T14:27:41,Zakuru,Tom thank you for saying this ;w; I didn't want the idea to go all crazy.. considering how popular those two are
03-10-2019T14:28:41,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-nibsbounce:
03-10-2019T14:36:25,SpazztasticKiwi,honestly that sketch brought out some telling commentary as it was
03-10-2019T14:37:16,SpazztasticKiwi,even in progress people were cranking the sexy times tractor
03-10-2019T14:37:47,SpazztasticKiwi,we need a spray bottle emote sometimes
03-10-2019T14:39:45,Zakuru,^
03-10-2019T14:41:10,SpazztasticKiwi,less sexy more Nibbly

03-10-2019T16:34:46,Zakuru,hi crrar
03-10-2019T16:35:32,Twokinds,What kind of beachwear would Raine look good in?
03-10-2019T16:36:14,Avolendi,Kinda surprised how much activity is here. Hopped in since I forgot its a lot earlier on friday ^^;
03-10-2019T16:36:29,tehbear,sandals and a straw hat
03-10-2019T16:36:29,Avolendi,Tiki? :P
03-10-2019T16:36:56,Twokinds,I'm almost certain about the straw hat
03-10-2019T16:37:33,Avolendi,Hmm. Mightve mixed things up. Meant like Hawaian
03-10-2019T16:37:44,iliar,Usual bikini? Why not?
03-10-2019T16:38:33,iliar,Like Maren's but blue https://www.patreon.com/posts/marens-bikini-14256747
03-10-2019T16:40:35,Avolendi,Maybe also relevant. Human or keidran Raine?
03-10-2019T16:41:21,iliar,"Obviously, we talk about human."
03-10-2019T16:43:09,iliar,"I'll try to guess. Tom is working on the next page. Since the Raine has taken a human form, now she can put on a swimsuit and go to the beach with the rest."
03-10-2019T16:43:37,Avolendi,Ah right. Still had my head on sketches
03-10-2019T16:43:39,Zakuru,im thinking of a criss cross one piece
03-10-2019T16:45:15,SpazztasticKiwi,blue ruffled tankini
03-10-2019T16:45:22,SpazztasticKiwi,do you know what a tankini is
03-10-2019T16:45:44,Zakuru,ye
03-10-2019T16:45:48,Zakuru,i looked it up lol
03-10-2019T16:47:27,horoisawolf,why not the yellow polka dot bikini agian?
03-10-2019T16:47:32,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m mainly asking Tom
03-10-2019T16:48:06,SpazztasticKiwi,call me crazy but I don’t see him as an expert on women’s swimwear
03-10-2019T16:49:56,TerraTheWizard,what horo was mentioning https://www.patreon.com/posts/raine-pin-up-14289772
03-10-2019T16:50:06,iliar,How about this https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a1/02/c2/a102c29680cdf4aade0f6f9e44b95db2.jpg
03-10-2019T16:50:51,SpazztasticKiwi,that’s not a tankini but you’re on the right color line
03-10-2019T16:51:33,tehbear,colorline is a ferry :ferry:
03-10-2019T16:51:36,SpazztasticKiwi,"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/524825976597643265/629797146220298250/image0.png this - blue with the same cover skirt as that other picture, straw hat & sandals"
03-10-2019T16:52:06,iliar,Why it should be tankini?
03-10-2019T16:52:23,SpazztasticKiwi,it was an idea
03-10-2019T16:52:27,SpazztasticKiwi,he asked I answered
03-10-2019T16:52:36,tehbear,"why, it should be tankini!"
03-10-2019T16:52:42,SpazztasticKiwi,could be a slingshot bikini for all I care
03-10-2019T16:52:53,SpazztasticKiwi,but he asked what kind Raine may wear
03-10-2019T16:53:43,iliar,https://www.deviantart.com/twokinds/art/Nib-Nab-590804569
03-10-2019T16:54:34,iliar,I think we should consult with Nibs  about swimsuit design.
03-10-2019T16:57:44,SpazztasticKiwi,"considering all the lady characters have the same body type, they’re all pretty well suited with any style"
03-10-2019T16:57:51,Xexanoth,No need to worry about swimsuits design when there i no swimsuit.
03-10-2019T16:57:55,Avolendi,Thought I'd check where Nibs' wardrobe session was and ran into Carver's fate on at the western(?) Basitins. Some things that would work there as well
03-10-2019T16:58:07,SpazztasticKiwi,just depends how much skin they want to show
03-10-2019T16:58:16,Avolendi,Page 1022 btw
03-10-2019T16:58:31,SpazztasticKiwi,which begs the question why a swimsuit at all when they got fur
03-10-2019T16:59:06,SpazztasticKiwi,and either I just saw double or they’ve hired a set of twins here
03-10-2019T16:59:08,Avolendi,"Granted, on that page its not swimwear, but would still work as beachwear?"
03-10-2019T17:00:29,SpazztasticKiwi,with the skirt no
03-10-2019T17:00:36,SpazztasticKiwi,that’s not something you swim in
03-10-2019T17:01:00,SpazztasticKiwi,at least I wouldn’t
03-10-2019T17:01:27,SpazztasticKiwi,got enough problems with some swim bottoms wanting to moon the pool because of water weight when you try to get out
03-10-2019T17:01:35,SpazztasticKiwi,don’t need a skirt to help matters
03-10-2019T17:03:15,iliar,Speaking of swimwear. I'm much more interested in what swimwear Reni will have
03-10-2019T17:03:43,SpazztasticKiwi,one sleeve off shoulder one piece
03-10-2019T17:03:58,tehbear,:ctwokinds-reniembarrassed:
03-10-2019T17:05:00,tehbear,will it be a human Reni i wonder
03-10-2019T17:06:24,SpazztasticKiwi,either way it’d work pretty well
03-10-2019T17:15:18,iliar,"Just a thought out loud. If you want to troll Russian people, make a swimsuit blue on top and yellow on the bottom. Like this https://pippintash.at.ua/_ph/1/2/819850492.jpg?1567245904"
03-10-2019T17:15:26,iliar,These are just two colors. But in the comments you will see a whole crowd of people who will throw shit at each other.
03-10-2019T17:16:54,horoisawolf,"why? iliar, what these colors stand for?"
03-10-2019T17:17:11,ThingsAreMoving,ukraine
03-10-2019T17:17:44,horoisawolf,"ah, that explains it xD"
03-10-2019T17:18:28,ThingsAreMoving,:ctwokinds-nibsbounce:
03-10-2019T17:23:19,iliar,Tom already made a swimsuit in blue and yellow. This was enough for some people. Although there are even colors in a different order. https://www.patreon.com/posts/bikini-madness-2-29638460
03-10-2019T17:33:20,SpazztasticKiwi,there was already a bit of a fit with the justice card when it got done
03-10-2019T17:33:39,SpazztasticKiwi,immediate response was “she’s supposed to be naked”
03-10-2019T17:39:51,SpazztasticKiwi,"eventhough technically none of the cards have a gender, they’re only visualized as the beings they are to give them physical representation"
03-10-2019T17:43:27,SpazztasticKiwi,blue yellow or blue gold colors work for Maddie and Raine since it matches them and their eyes
03-10-2019T17:44:40,SpazztasticKiwi,the style seems to be the question and that’s dependent on their personalities - I can’t see either in a thong or cheeky style
03-10-2019T17:45:32,Twokinds,I do not understand the signifigence of blue and yellow. But I do think blue and yellow look good together.
03-10-2019T17:45:45,Twokinds,And they are pretty much Raine's colors. White blue and yellow.
03-10-2019T17:48:44,SpazztasticKiwi,white blue and yellow go together with much of any other color all things considered
03-10-2019T17:49:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Raine would look good in pearl blue and gold
03-10-2019T17:49:11,iliar,https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Ukraine
03-10-2019T17:50:02,iliar,I know that sounds silly.  But some people react strangely to these colors.
03-10-2019T17:50:21,ThingsAreMoving,"Some color pairings do work pretty well. Purple and orange, or crimson and white are one of the most lively imho."
03-10-2019T17:57:15,BadFoMo,"//Joke Are we still giving ideas on what beach wear Raine should have? If so, what about a Coconut Bra and Enchanted Swim Trunks that morph into a Mermaid tail when wet?"
03-10-2019T17:57:45,SpazztasticKiwi,a furry mermaid
03-10-2019T17:58:07,SpazztasticKiwi,why don’t you put a horn on her head and complete the set while you’re at it
03-10-2019T17:58:25,SpazztasticKiwi,wolfmaid unicorn
03-10-2019T17:58:31,SpazztasticKiwi,just add glitter
03-10-2019T17:59:27,SpazztasticKiwi,as for the colors people are gonna throw a fit whatever ends up happening
03-10-2019T17:59:36,SpazztasticKiwi,let them
03-10-2019T17:59:39,BadFoMo,I thought she'd be in her Human fourm for this.
03-10-2019T17:59:50,BadFoMo,*form?
03-10-2019T18:00:19,SpazztasticKiwi,fourm too; she’d be writing fanfics about that
03-10-2019T18:00:24,ThingsAreMoving,Raine turned into a Narwhal

03-10-2019T23:51:02,LannAF,apparently I'm bad at telling Pink from red sometimes
03-10-2019T23:51:09,LannAF,....
03-10-2019T23:51:17,JeremySenpai,this was actually a practice peice in perspective and anatomy that looked too good not to go as far as i can with.
03-10-2019T23:51:17,Mihari,Sometimes?
03-10-2019T23:51:18,LannAF,Sage don't say it.
03-10-2019T23:51:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,how....
03-10-2019T23:51:28,LannAF,"I mean, I could tell this time."
03-10-2019T23:51:32,MarvTheHugPharaoh,pink is pink and red is red
03-10-2019T23:51:35,LannAF,so it's gotta be good for something
03-10-2019T23:51:39,LannAF,boi I'm colorblind
03-10-2019T23:51:44,MarvTheHugPharaoh,pink is great red is dread
03-10-2019T23:51:47,LannAF,Especially sensitive to red
03-10-2019T23:51:59,LannAF,Although I got pink and tan confused once in a horrifically embarassing accident.
03-10-2019T23:52:09,MarvTheHugPharaoh,do tell

03-10-2019T23:54:01,LannAF,I can tell I'm in that slump because I start mind numbingly playing Movie Battles 2
03-10-2019T23:54:10,Mihari,That might have to do with you telling your friends you can play with them me thinks :P

03-10-2019T23:54:29,LannAF,I just scheduled a game with sage and also with fluff on a separate occasion this weekend so I'm hoping I don't feel too bleh

03-10-2019T23:55:40,LannAF,couldn't play what
03-10-2019T23:55:49,LannAF,I don't recall this
03-10-2019T23:56:01,SageSaga,i forget what- i was busy when yall were chatting
03-10-2019T23:56:02,LannAF,My memory of the past week is a blur of exhaustion and exasperation at people
03-10-2019T23:56:09,LannAF,Hrmmmmmm
03-10-2019T23:56:18,LannAF,Sieeeege?
03-10-2019T23:56:20,SageSaga,but i know you didnt say you would play something
03-10-2019T23:56:21,LannAF,No not that.
03-10-2019T23:56:23,Mihari,"stamp Lann's forehead with ""Honourary Ron!"""
03-10-2019T23:56:44,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Lon
03-10-2019T23:56:44,Ordithus,pfft
03-10-2019T23:56:53,SageSaga,i think he did ask if you wanted to play something sometime because y'all hadnt played together in a while
03-10-2019T23:56:53,LannAF,I really can't recall such a convo sage
03-10-2019T23:56:59,LannAF,O_o
03-10-2019T23:57:13,LannAF,The only times we've spoken recently is: When he hopped in when I was about to go to school in discord
03-10-2019T23:57:19,LannAF,And when you were playing MHW with him
03-10-2019T23:57:28,SageSaga,yeah thats when he asked ya about playing something
03-10-2019T23:57:32,LannAF,Unless you mean weeks before that- in which case- I haven't the foggiest.
03-10-2019T23:57:36,LannAF,Hrmph.
03-10-2019T23:57:48,LannAF,During the first or the second part
03-10-2019T23:58:15,LannAF,"It has to be Siege, I can't think of any other"
03-10-2019T23:58:35,SageSaga,well i remember it because hes mentioned it before - that hes messaged ya about playing in the past but you always said no so he kinda stopped
03-10-2019T23:58:39,LannAF,"Payday is the only other game he's suggested with me, and I am sure he hasn't said it"
03-10-2019T23:59:01,LannAF,"That's odd, I remember us talking about siege before I left recently"
03-10-2019T23:59:07,LannAF,I'm down to siege with him
03-10-2019T23:59:16,LannAF,Maybe I gave the wrong impression
03-10-2019T23:59:34,SageSaga,Well - Picture done!
03-10-2019T23:59:39,LannAF,Great job :D
