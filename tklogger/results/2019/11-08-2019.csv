11-08-2019T00:11:36,AspiringNoodle,"I'm sure if this job pans out for a while, I'll finally build up some confidence <3"
11-08-2019T00:12:11,AspiringNoodle,Only took me carding 3 people or so who were obviously over 30 (closer to their 40) before I got a feel for who's legal and who's not
11-08-2019T00:20:27,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve never tried getting alcohol but I wonder if and how much I’d get carded
11-08-2019T00:20:51,SpazztasticKiwi,my manager said the other day someone carded her and couldn’t believe she was 30
11-08-2019T00:21:06,SpazztasticKiwi,most thrilled she’d been in awhile
11-08-2019T00:30:01,AspiringNoodle,"The one lady was thrilled, lol"
11-08-2019T00:30:09,AspiringNoodle,"Because same reason, it flattered her :P"
11-08-2019T00:30:40,AspiringNoodle,One guy was me just being an idiot (he did come back later and I got him his tobaccey)
11-08-2019T00:31:19,AspiringNoodle,And the other guy was probably similar to the lady
11-08-2019T00:31:38,AspiringNoodle,"He was very clean cut, so I could use hair / facial hair as indicators, and he didn't really have wrinkles.  He looked young."
11-08-2019T00:31:53,AspiringNoodle,couldn't use*
11-08-2019T00:32:11,AspiringNoodle,"that said, there were probably some other things I missed"
11-08-2019T00:33:09,SpazztasticKiwi,I know some guys who can literally shave 10-20 years off
11-08-2019T00:33:44,AspiringNoodle,"Also, I didn't do too bad for my first day / 8-hour shift"
11-08-2019T00:33:56,AspiringNoodle,Apparently my till went through $2300 in merchandise
11-08-2019T00:34:34,SpazztasticKiwi,some look R E A L L Y good with a beard
11-08-2019T00:40:41,AspiringNoodle,I'ma go to bed now :D
11-08-2019T01:49:50,SpazztasticKiwi,nite Tom
11-08-2019T02:08:51,DarthRexKing,Bye!
11-08-2019T03:13:29,FloofyCat,"I got interview tomorrow, I just really hope I don't have to work 9pm Sundays which is when sketch stream is on in the UK..."

11-08-2019T10:34:36,AspiringNoodle,I'm awake D:
11-08-2019T10:34:50,AspiringNoodle,Last night was fun
11-08-2019T10:35:06,AspiringNoodle,"First 2 hours or so of trying to sleep, feet / shins are killing me, so I take some pills"
11-08-2019T10:35:29,AspiringNoodle,"After that, my body was having mini anxiety-attacks over stupid stuff :ptv-unimpressed:"
11-08-2019T10:36:17,AspiringNoodle,"I can't remember exactly what they were about, but best guess is that I was trying to sleep and my mind kept coming up with ""What about this totally unlikely / unrealistic scenario at work?"""
11-08-2019T10:38:03,CrimsonQuill,Missed the last few sketches
11-08-2019T10:38:08,CrimsonQuill,Checked recording
11-08-2019T10:38:23,CrimsonQuill,I'm glad the Snow Basitin one was chosen-it's nice
11-08-2019T10:38:30,FreedomCrusader,What do you work with Noodle?
11-08-2019T10:38:59,FreedomCrusader,"yeah, cehcked trough the stream myself, sadly didn't have time for more than the first sketch live"

11-08-2019T11:01:11,AspiringNoodle,"""Training"" day was busy, lol"
11-08-2019T11:01:29,AspiringNoodle,"Ended up collecting around $2,300 in transactions"
11-08-2019T11:02:21,FreedomCrusader,just started the training or been there for awhile?
11-08-2019T11:03:21,FreedomCrusader,"I don't really know wheather 2300$ would be alot for a gas station, but gj"
11-08-2019T11:03:44,FreedomCrusader,:thumbsup:
11-08-2019T11:05:00,AspiringNoodle,Yesterday was my first day.  And that was just my register xD
11-08-2019T11:05:28,AspiringNoodle,A lot of our big sales are tobacco / vape pods
11-08-2019T11:05:40,AspiringNoodle,"Some lottery, but mostly thoe former two"
11-08-2019T11:13:32,AspiringNoodle,"On the bright side, now that I have a viable source of income, I can worry about working on other things :D"
11-08-2019T11:15:15,FreedomCrusader,"oh, working on things like education or thinking more about hobbies?"
11-08-2019T11:17:44,AspiringNoodle,"I already have a college degree, but I got it thinking I'd go into game development, sooooooo..."
11-08-2019T11:17:53,AspiringNoodle,Exploring other options :|
11-08-2019T11:19:25,FreedomCrusader,"ah, well good luck with that then :)"
11-08-2019T11:20:20,SniperJackal,Game development must be extremely stressful tho
11-08-2019T11:20:44,AspiringNoodle,I more or less learned the numerous downsides waaaaaay too far into my degree
11-08-2019T11:27:13,AspiringNoodle,"On the bright side, I can learn more ways to code in the future if I need to :3"
11-08-2019T11:55:51,AspiringNoodle,I think I'm gonna do 1 of 2 things today
11-08-2019T11:56:06,AspiringNoodle,Either get through all my youtube backlog
11-08-2019T11:56:16,FreedomCrusader,doing that one
11-08-2019T11:56:25,AspiringNoodle,"Or go through yet another ""what do I want to watch"" restructuring"
11-08-2019T11:57:00,FreedomCrusader,gave up on that one and deleted it
11-08-2019T11:57:09,AspiringNoodle,lol
11-08-2019T11:57:11,FreedomCrusader,I jsut never end up following those lists
11-08-2019T11:57:28,AspiringNoodle,"Tbh, I've done it before"
11-08-2019T11:57:44,AspiringNoodle,I ended up unsubbing to a few channels and severely cut back on one I didn't sub to
11-08-2019T11:59:02,AspiringNoodle,The problem typically comes in when I watch stuff from channels that regularly put out 10 - 20 minute content
11-08-2019T11:59:43,AspiringNoodle,"Becomes too easy for me to need to watch 2 hours of content to keep up to speed, unless I only watch at a rate of every other video or so :/"
11-08-2019T12:17:28,Mikemkke034,Hey noodle
11-08-2019T12:23:15,AspiringNoodle,Hai hai :ptv-hearts:
11-08-2019T12:37:28,Mikemkke034,How're you mah dude
11-08-2019T12:39:11,AspiringNoodle,tired xD
11-08-2019T12:40:02,AspiringNoodle,"Also... while watching this video, feeling like catching up on pokemon"
11-08-2019T12:40:16,AspiringNoodle,I stopped playing after the original black and white ;_;
11-08-2019T12:40:28,Mikemkke034,I've been playing on PokeMMO
11-08-2019T12:40:33,AspiringNoodle,And I can't remember when they did the reboots of old series
11-08-2019T12:40:35,Mikemkke034,"Also, my TK shirt finally came in"
11-08-2019T12:43:51,Sclimshady,"I thought I enrolled in college.  Why tf do I have to write two paragraphs about myself and submit a picture, then reply to a classmates submission?"
11-08-2019T12:44:08,Mikemkke034,Who knows Sclim
11-08-2019T12:44:23,Mikemkke034,"Maybe they want you to ""Already know"" your classmates :joy:"
11-08-2019T12:45:05,Sclimshady,I already don't like them and I will never meet them because its online.
11-08-2019T12:45:13,Mikemkke034,Lol
11-08-2019T12:46:27,Sclimshady,"These kids were in middle school while I was in Afghanistan,  I just want to pass and get on with my life"
11-08-2019T12:46:47,AspiringNoodle,"If it makes you feel any better, academia is dying <3"
11-08-2019T12:47:01,AspiringNoodle,"Skillshare is on the rise, and some companies are beginning to realize degrees don't mean shite"
11-08-2019T12:47:26,Sclimshady,"Tell me about it,  this english class is required for me to get certified as a welder"
11-08-2019T12:47:59,Sclimshady,Is my conjugation gonna weaken the welds?
11-08-2019T12:48:31,AspiringNoodle,That's the other thing
11-08-2019T12:48:47,AspiringNoodle,"While I personally enjoyed my humanities / ""well-rounded person"" classes"
11-08-2019T12:48:57,AspiringNoodle,They don't exactly do anything for what you plan to do...
11-08-2019T12:49:49,AspiringNoodle,More or less they basically double the amount of classes you need to take
11-08-2019T12:50:18,Sclimshady,I'd be real mad if I wasn't getting paid to go to school
11-08-2019T12:50:26,AspiringNoodle,And since college costs keep ballooning at rates faster than inflation... it's becoming more and more absurd to require people to take extra classes that aren't directly useful for your major
11-08-2019T12:51:03,AspiringNoodle,Not to mention the rise of these useless majors
11-08-2019T12:51:11,Sclimshady,"This college isn't too bad, my tuition is 700 dollars that i'm not paying"
11-08-2019T12:51:30,AspiringNoodle,Where I went to school wasn't too bad
11-08-2019T12:51:47,AspiringNoodle,"I think it was in the ballpark of $8,000 - $10,000 a year for all the classes"
11-08-2019T12:52:11,AspiringNoodle,I studied in-state and went to a university that was an hour from home
11-08-2019T12:52:27,Sclimshady,"Dang, thats why I like my community colleges"
11-08-2019T12:52:32,AspiringNoodle,"Lost 2 hours every day I had class or needed to be on campus, but at least that was money I WASN'T spending on room and board, lol"
11-08-2019T12:53:07,Mikemkke034,Lol
11-08-2019T12:53:18,AspiringNoodle,"Seriously, lol"
11-08-2019T12:53:35,AspiringNoodle,"What's worse, losing 8 - 10 hours a week to travel, and spending ~$10 a day on gas"
11-08-2019T12:53:47,AspiringNoodle,"Or spending another $4,300 or so on room and board per semester?"
11-08-2019T12:53:58,Mikemkke034,I'd rather take the former
11-08-2019T12:54:16,AspiringNoodle,"I do feel rather stunted, tbh"
11-08-2019T12:54:24,Mikemkke034,Why's that?
11-08-2019T12:54:46,AspiringNoodle,"At 26 I'm finally getting a job for real, and still live with my parents, and haven't had any away from home experience :/"
11-08-2019T12:55:20,Mikemkke034,"Tbh, there's not really anything terribly wrong with that"
11-08-2019T12:56:10,Mikemkke034,"You've been at school most of your life. So, nothing to worry about, right?"
11-08-2019T12:56:19,AspiringNoodle,I guess that's true
11-08-2019T12:56:49,Mikemkke034,"It'd be different if you sat at home all day, not going to school, and not getting a job"
11-08-2019T12:58:13,AspiringNoodle,"Man, here's hoping I drop 100 lbs thanks to this job"
11-08-2019T12:58:26,AspiringNoodle,I would like to not feel tired and sleep reasonably xD
11-08-2019T12:58:26,Mikemkke034,What's your job?
11-08-2019T12:58:40,AspiringNoodle,For now I work the register at a gas station :3
11-08-2019T12:58:47,Mikemkke034,Ah
11-08-2019T12:59:05,AspiringNoodle,For now I'm part time
11-08-2019T12:59:12,AspiringNoodle,But part time means 32 hours or less
11-08-2019T12:59:23,Mikemkke034,"I've mentioned it a few times, but I work ""everything"" at Little Caesar's"
11-08-2019T12:59:37,AspiringNoodle,I hope you get paid well
11-08-2019T12:59:51,AspiringNoodle,The starting wage for this particular chain is $9.50 an hour
11-08-2019T13:00:04,Mikemkke034,$7.25 is min here
11-08-2019T13:00:07,FreedomCrusader,"As a man of reasonable wiegth with a job, don't count on any of that to help with being tired :/"
11-08-2019T13:00:11,Mikemkke034,And I get paid $8.50
11-08-2019T13:00:56,AspiringNoodle,"Well, I'm borderline morbidly obese"
11-08-2019T13:01:12,AspiringNoodle,And from what I've read fatigue and sleep problems can come with the territory
11-08-2019T13:01:27,AspiringNoodle,I just want to be able to feel rested on 7 - 8 hours of sleep
11-08-2019T13:01:50,FreedomCrusader,"propably, my tiredness comes from the less than 6 hours of sleep I get"
11-08-2019T13:02:02,Mikemkke034,I think I've got ya beat
11-08-2019T13:02:09,FreedomCrusader,"or from my moms genes, she has some sleep sickness stuff that is genetical"
11-08-2019T13:02:19,Mikemkke034,That may be it
11-08-2019T13:02:39,AspiringNoodle,I've more or less suffered from insomnia
11-08-2019T13:02:52,Mikemkke034,raise hand
11-08-2019T13:02:54,Mikemkke034,Me too
11-08-2019T13:02:54,FreedomCrusader,"or you know, maybe it's the 4 screens I am looking at"
11-08-2019T13:03:01,FreedomCrusader,gee it's a mystery
11-08-2019T13:03:02,AspiringNoodle,"And while weight contributes to that, the other half may be that I don't sleep at regular times"
11-08-2019T13:03:17,Mikemkke034,"Nah, freedom, its definitely NOT the screens"
11-08-2019T13:03:24,AspiringNoodle,"Even now that I've gotten somewhat of a handle on my schedule, I don't have scheduled times"
11-08-2019T13:03:29,FreedomCrusader,"look, I'm sorry mike"
11-08-2019T13:03:34,FreedomCrusader,I can't take you serious
11-08-2019T13:03:42,Mikemkke034,Why's that?
11-08-2019T13:03:45,FreedomCrusader,Mike is the name of my apprentice at work
11-08-2019T13:03:49,AspiringNoodle,"For the most part, I will fall asleep at 1 - 2 and wake up at 7:30 - 8:30"
11-08-2019T13:03:51,Mikemkke034,Ah
11-08-2019T13:03:54,FreedomCrusader,and my horse in a certain dnd campaign
11-08-2019T13:04:08,Mikemkke034,Now I see why. I'm laughing at it myself
11-08-2019T13:04:10,Sclimshady,You really don't like Mikes do ya
11-08-2019T13:04:17,AspiringNoodle,I might settle on going to sleep at 1 and waking up at 8:30 :3
11-08-2019T13:04:21,FreedomCrusader,it wasn't on purpoise even
11-08-2019T13:04:24,Mikemkke034,Gee Sclim
11-08-2019T13:04:38,FreedomCrusader,"my dm gave me that horse and the name, he didn't know about my apprentice"
11-08-2019T13:04:51,Sclimshady,On porpoise
11-08-2019T13:04:51,Mikemkke034,And now you're here with me
11-08-2019T13:04:59,FreedomCrusader,oof
11-08-2019T13:05:00,Mikemkke034,"Wonderful world, isn't it?"
11-08-2019T13:05:01,FreedomCrusader,purpose
11-08-2019T13:05:14,Sclimshady,I wanna ride a dolphin though
11-08-2019T13:05:26,Mikemkke034,That'd be fun
11-08-2019T13:05:47,FreedomCrusader,that'd be cool
11-08-2019T13:05:51,FreedomCrusader,but strange
11-08-2019T13:05:59,FreedomCrusader,mostly cool though
11-08-2019T13:06:03,Mikemkke034,"And it's also very ""off topic"""
11-08-2019T13:06:53,FreedomCrusader,I don't see how riding dolphins would ever be off topic?
11-08-2019T13:07:04,Sclimshady,I shall be Aquaman
11-08-2019T13:07:34,FreedomCrusader,"I do believe you will find that dificult, but good luck"
11-08-2019T13:08:37,Mikemkke034,Lol
11-08-2019T13:09:02,Sclimshady,You sayin I ain't as sexy as Jason Mamoa
11-08-2019T13:09:14,Sclimshady,Or however you spell his name
11-08-2019T13:09:35,Mikemkke034,You might be. Never even seen ya mate
11-08-2019T13:09:41,Sclimshady,I'm not
11-08-2019T13:09:48,Mikemkke034,Lmao
11-08-2019T13:09:53,Mikemkke034,At least you admit
11-08-2019T13:09:56,FreedomCrusader,"I guess statistics makes it unlikely, but if you claim you are I will give you the benefit of the doubt"
11-08-2019T13:09:58,Sclimshady,But i'm still offended
11-08-2019T13:10:07,Mikemkke034,By whom?
11-08-2019T13:10:17,Sclimshady,Myself mostly
11-08-2019T13:10:22,Mikemkke034,Ah
11-08-2019T13:13:12,Mikemkke034,"Has anyone seen the film ""Twenty Twenty-Four""?"
11-08-2019T13:13:32,Sclimshady,Have not even heard of it
11-08-2019T13:13:44,FreedomCrusader,no from me
11-08-2019T13:13:57,Mikemkke034,It's on Hulu. I'm watching it right now. Seems pretty interesting
11-08-2019T13:14:39,AspiringNoodle,Is it as political as I think is it? xD
11-08-2019T13:15:11,Mikemkke034,I don't think so
11-08-2019T13:15:22,Mikemkke034,It's about a guy that is isolated in a bunker
11-08-2019T13:15:54,Sclimshady,I found some heroine in a bunker before
11-08-2019T13:16:30,Sclimshady,Heroin
11-08-2019T13:16:47,Mikemkke034,Nice
11-08-2019T13:17:20,Sclimshady,Slightly concerning because it was in a minefield
11-08-2019T13:17:32,Mikemkke034,Oh
11-08-2019T13:17:52,FreedomCrusader,"where do you live, 1940?"
11-08-2019T13:18:18,Sclimshady,"Actually, it was an old wwII bunker so yeah"

11-08-2019T14:10:03,Mikemkke034,Lmfao
11-08-2019T14:12:41,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
11-08-2019T14:15:13,Mikemkke034,BO3 campaign has SO MANY cutscenes...
11-08-2019T14:21:49,TerraTheWizard,it's to pad the fact there's no gameplay :ctwokinds-smug:
11-08-2019T14:24:53,AspiringNoodle,Black Ops 4
11-08-2019T14:25:07,AspiringNoodle,It's so ahead of its time and so revolutionary that it has NO campaign :D
11-08-2019T14:27:25,Mikemkke034,I'm talking about BO3
11-08-2019T14:27:32,Mikemkke034,Not 4
11-08-2019T14:27:38,Mikemkke034,I have both though
11-08-2019T14:28:09,AspiringNoodle,I know
11-08-2019T14:28:18,Mikemkke034,lol
11-08-2019T14:28:19,AspiringNoodle,And I'm just saying that Black Ops 4 tried going the other way :P
11-08-2019T14:28:25,AspiringNoodle,"All the gameplay, no story, lmao"
11-08-2019T14:28:28,Mikemkke034,And kinda falied
11-08-2019T14:28:58,AspiringNoodle,I wonder what it would be like if CEO's and other executives were held liable for a company flopping
11-08-2019T14:29:09,Mikemkke034,Hmmm
11-08-2019T14:29:12,AspiringNoodle,"Look at Bobby, he is SERIOUSLY overpaid, and I get an idea of what he's doing"
11-08-2019T14:29:25,Mikemkke034,Lol
11-08-2019T14:29:29,AspiringNoodle,"He's squeezing the company and franchise for all its worth, loading his pockets with bonuses and extras"
11-08-2019T14:29:42,AspiringNoodle,"And when the company sinks, so what?  He already made his millions"
11-08-2019T14:29:49,Mikemkke034,Then just gonna ditch last second before the company goes south
11-08-2019T14:29:56,AspiringNoodle,Yeah
11-08-2019T14:30:08,AspiringNoodle,Now imagine if laws required people in those positions to cough up for expenses
11-08-2019T14:30:09,Mikemkke034,So HIS name doesn't get thrown into the mix :joy:
11-08-2019T14:30:29,Mikemkke034,"Hmm, interesting idea"
11-08-2019T14:30:31,AspiringNoodle,"Say the company goes under, and they have to pay benefits, severance packages"
11-08-2019T14:30:57,Mikemkke034,Everything that was a result of the sinkage
11-08-2019T14:31:04,AspiringNoodle,"All of a sudden, longevity becomes a company's priority"
11-08-2019T14:31:15,AspiringNoodle,"And we can nip this short-term, investor pleasing bullshit in the bud"
11-08-2019T14:31:44,Mikemkke034,"Woah, something that companies should have ALREADY implemented years ago :yum:"
11-08-2019T14:32:06,AspiringNoodle,"Don't get me wrong, I predict it's too late for Activision"
11-08-2019T14:32:16,Mikemkke034,Too much so
11-08-2019T14:32:20,AspiringNoodle,They're spitting in the face of their customers to squeeze every last drop of cash they can to please investors
11-08-2019T14:32:41,AspiringNoodle,"They've already plateau'd with the CoD franchise, and with the way they've been acting, it'll start shrinking"
11-08-2019T14:33:40,AspiringNoodle,"That said, we also need to see what they do with Modern Warfare"
11-08-2019T14:33:53,AspiringNoodle,I've heard VERY good things about it.  Pissing off games urinalist things :3
11-08-2019T14:38:00,Mikemkke034,Lol

11-08-2019T14:47:33,AspiringNoodle,And I don't think it's just been the lack of watching youtube.  I may have too many channels / videos
11-08-2019T14:48:03,Mikemkke034,Oof
11-08-2019T14:48:41,Mikemkke034,Maybe you should prioritize what you watch and when
11-08-2019T14:49:14,AspiringNoodle,And become picker as to what I watch ;P
11-08-2019T14:49:33,Mikemkke034,:joy:
11-08-2019T14:49:44,AspiringNoodle,The tech channels I watch I typically have certain videos I ignore
11-08-2019T14:49:50,AspiringNoodle,Namely product reviews
11-08-2019T14:50:02,Mikemkke034,Yeah
