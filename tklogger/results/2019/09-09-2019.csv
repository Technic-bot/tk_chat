09-09-2019T00:12:52,AspiringNoodle,"Sooo, to recap the last week or so at my place of employment"
09-09-2019T00:13:05,AspiringNoodle,night guy fired for being late / calling off too much / no showing too often
09-09-2019T00:13:30,AspiringNoodle,Another employee (of 1 year) quit with no notice after getting fed up with dealing with the shite from the person on shift before them
09-09-2019T00:13:38,AspiringNoodle,And I was sick for a week with some unknown illness
09-09-2019T00:14:09,AspiringNoodle,"So all in all, someone poured gasoline on this dumpster fire, and I am going to bed xD"
09-09-2019T00:37:01,SpazztasticKiwi,nite Tom
09-09-2019T03:38:04,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-kingtea:
09-09-2019T05:23:51,WINDOWS98SE,Another day without Laura. :ctwokinds-LauraCry:
09-09-2019T08:22:41,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
09-09-2019T08:53:26,Dadrobit,"I mean, she had her plot sendoff six years ago. She's been literally dead for 8 years. Maybe just maybe she shouldn't have much priority considering she's been dead for the better part of a decade?"
09-09-2019T09:00:08,WINDOWS98SE,"No, I disagree and take the complete opposite view.  The fact she's out of the comic now should be all the more reason for her to be drawn in sketches, especially considering her key role and close relationship with Keith."
09-09-2019T09:00:18,WINDOWS98SE,"Imagine the outcry if Natani died in the comic and her fans were told to just ""suck it up"", no more Natani sketches for you.  Well some of us Laura fans feel as strongly for Laura as they do for Natani, if not more so."
09-09-2019T09:30:12,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-keithdotdotdot:
09-09-2019T11:07:52,Dadrobit,"Bruh, she featured in less than 45 pages total in this entire comic. She has been in 4% of the total run time and died 8 years ago. Hell, even Maddie has more than double that screen time."
09-09-2019T11:08:20,Dadrobit,"Laura featured 42, Maddie, 86."
09-09-2019T11:10:28,TerraTheWizard,also there are other characters that deserve sketches
09-09-2019T11:10:31,TerraTheWizard,like lynn
09-09-2019T11:10:48,TerraTheWizard,last sketch he was in was january last year
09-09-2019T11:11:16,Dadrobit,Lynn even has 43 appearances.
09-09-2019T11:11:46,Dadrobit,My dude Lynn is firmly a background character and he's had more presence than Laura.
09-09-2019T11:14:33,Dadrobit,"Oh, and Terra, I'm working on that with my next sketch, here's hoping I can squeeze him in."
09-09-2019T11:15:39,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
09-09-2019T11:17:00,Dadrobit,"Lynn, taking studious ""advice"" from Sythe regarding diplomatic relations."
09-09-2019T11:30:32,Dadrobit,"Heck, the last time we even saw him in the comic proper was two years ago after he tried warning off Keith from sharing a room with Natani."
09-09-2019T11:34:04,Dadrobit,"Anywho, off to bed with me, I've spent enough time wasting about not sleeping."
09-09-2019T11:36:04,WINDOWS98SE,"Would you deny the huge impact she had, both on story and emotionally in those 42 pages?  You mention Lynn; at least his fans can still look forward to him in the comic."
09-09-2019T11:36:13,WINDOWS98SE,"If you want to argue statistics, then let me present mine.  Between July 2016 and May 2019, Laura was averaging 1.6 sketches per month.  Since the new system, this has dropped to 0.  Not only has Laura been cast into outer darkness, but now her fans also."
09-09-2019T11:44:42,Dadrobit,"The ""new system"" has only even been used six times in 4 months. Free voting Laura fans have had access to more than half of all the votes since Tom has been implementing paid voting. Maybe accept that she was way too over-represented and that it's fine."
09-09-2019T11:45:09,Dadrobit,Heading to sleep for real now. o/
09-09-2019T12:00:08,TerraTheWizard,o/
09-09-2019T12:09:20,WINDOWS98SE,"When I say ""new system"", I mean the Google forms voting, not tkpolls.  Even with the new tkpolls, she still stands a chance of winning."
09-09-2019T12:09:25,WINDOWS98SE,"tkpolls is only used under special circumstances (e.g. Tom going to con, or if Tom forgot to post the Google forms poll)."
09-09-2019T12:09:36,WINDOWS98SE,"It is not fine, you're telling me to ""suck it up"" again.  You don't like Laura and if she was never drawn again, you'd be fine with it, I get that.  Even if she was ""over-represented"", which I disagree with, she's now not represented at all!"
09-09-2019T12:14:29,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-keithdotdotdot:
09-09-2019T12:18:02,ZRO4825,"Here's an idea. Instead of presenting some sort of fictitious argument about how she's some sort of conspiracy point now, pay for patreon, put in Laura suggestions, and get them voted into winning. Part of why Laura is so lacking now is because she"
09-09-2019T12:18:32,ZRO4825,"flooded the votes previously, to the point where people got tired of her. She had an impact on story yes, but hey, that's the whole idea behind a background character who dies. They make an impact, and they're gone."
09-09-2019T12:19:01,TerraTheWizard,ohey zro
09-09-2019T12:19:09,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-florajiggle:
09-09-2019T12:19:13,ZRO4825,Oh herro thar '.'/
09-09-2019T12:25:46,WINDOWS98SE,"I was a Patreon, and suggested Laura for four months straight.  She's never winning again in the new polls and Tom's never picking her."
09-09-2019T12:25:50,WINDOWS98SE,"It's not really a conspiracy at this point, and it becomes even less so each passing week."
09-09-2019T12:26:03,WINDOWS98SE,"I quit Patreon as it leaves me freer to talk about her here in chat (so I can't be accused of pushing for my own suggestions, and also because suggesting her is becoming hopeless)."
09-09-2019T12:26:09,WINDOWS98SE,"I wouldn't call her a ""background character"".  She's no Therie.  She punched well above her weight story wise."
09-09-2019T12:28:06,ZRO4825,At best she is a side character. Pushing for anything above that is asking for far more than she ever was. Point is she was part of the story for a singular purpose and that purpose has been served.
09-09-2019T12:28:23,ZRO4825,So she's not winning popularity votes right now and Tom's not picking her. That happens. It's just how things go sometimes.
09-09-2019T12:32:26,WINDOWS98SE,I disagree vehemently.  The emotional turmoil Tom pumped through her character elevated her above even the main cast in my eyes.
09-09-2019T12:32:30,WINDOWS98SE,"And she served more than ""one purpose"".  She was the star of the Basidian Isles and the boat."
09-09-2019T12:32:32,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-nibrun:
09-09-2019T12:32:35,WINDOWS98SE,"Tom doesn't pick her, I lament over her.  Things are as they are."

09-09-2019T13:28:06,AspiringNoodle,Brutus is the most precious dumb fluffy b0i :ptv-hearts:
09-09-2019T13:28:20,AspiringNoodle,We must protect him at all costs

09-09-2019T14:02:43,SpazztasticKiwi,and I missed zro
09-09-2019T14:03:58,SomeNiceUser,"Brutus is not very smart, but wholesome."
09-09-2019T14:04:41,SomeNiceUser,Maybe it’s not the right word for it but I’m also not very smart.
09-09-2019T14:09:39,SomeNiceUser,"Also, tomorrow is the day I finally get that package!"
09-09-2019T14:10:32,tehbear,:package::computer:
09-09-2019T14:10:47,SomeNiceUser,Indeed bear.
09-09-2019T14:11:35,SomeNiceUser,"I’m kinda excited for it, but the thing that would suck if the laptop would be defective or smashed."
09-09-2019T14:12:16,tehbear,they are usually well packaged. lots of styrofoam
09-09-2019T14:13:20,SomeNiceUser,Would be more fun with bubble wrap though.
09-09-2019T14:13:32,SomeNiceUser,pop
09-09-2019T14:15:02,SomeNiceUser,But styrofoam is pretty good for protecting electronics.
09-09-2019T14:15:26,SomeNiceUser,Maybe not HDDs.
