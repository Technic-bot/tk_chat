07-04-2019T19:14:42,Twokinds,Patreon upped their tag limit per post from 5 to 50.
07-04-2019T19:14:58,Twokinds,That's so much better. Now I can finally include all characters when there's a big group.
07-04-2019T19:19:23,Dadrobit,Are you going to go back and update the old ones? That'd be quite the task.
