28-04-2019T00:04:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I wonder how that infection is now that I think on it
28-04-2019T00:04:30,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: wwwwhich infection?
28-04-2019T00:12:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Mark got an infection in one of his wisdom teeth spots
28-04-2019T00:16:56,Bgrmystr2,oo those aren't good
28-04-2019T00:17:00,Bgrmystr2,been there done that
28-04-2019T00:17:09,Bgrmystr2,got the $8k dentist bill from it
28-04-2019T00:18:13,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs got insurance
28-04-2019T00:18:47,Bgrmystr2,good
28-04-2019T00:18:49,Bgrmystr2,because I don't.
28-04-2019T00:19:06,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs just good he‚Äôs fixing it before it spread or became a bigger problem
28-04-2019T00:21:37,SpazztasticKiwi,I know why he can‚Äôt drink. His guardian angel must be like a fish
28-04-2019T00:57:04,Twokinds,Yes infections of the mouth can be quite serious if left untreated.
28-04-2019T01:08:28,DarthRexKing,Good to hear. Goodnight. :V
28-04-2019T01:17:35,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs been about a week I‚Äôd say since so I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs fine
28-04-2019T01:18:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Even had a livestream hour before his appointment to get it checked out
28-04-2019T01:20:35,Bgrmystr2,my internet upload kicked the bucket hard
28-04-2019T01:20:46,Bgrmystr2,I have zero upload
28-04-2019T01:21:10,Bgrmystr2,"download is normal, ping is normal, upload has just disappeared."
28-04-2019T01:27:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôd imagine you‚Äôd know about this mess Tom. Marks said y‚Äôall‚Äôs mom watches his media
28-04-2019T01:27:17,SpazztasticKiwi,For some reason my internet has a fit or two at times
28-04-2019T01:27:31,SpazztasticKiwi,I think it‚Äôs way of saying ‚ÄúTAKE A BREAK‚Äù
28-04-2019T01:32:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Which my phone also likes to tell me my screen time percentage. Every. Week
28-04-2019T01:34:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Also also. Calligraphy s‚Äôs are infuriating in case anyone is wondering

28-04-2019T13:29:40,CrimsonQuill,I love this!
28-04-2019T13:35:02,Twokinds,Thanks!

28-04-2019T13:38:32,CrimsonQuill,XD I've just looked at my Deviantart Favourites and realised just how much Raine and Halo I have...
28-04-2019T13:38:44,CrimsonQuill,Not surprising really.
28-04-2019T13:38:55,CrimsonQuill,"Hey Tom, may I please tell you a bit about Geodesy?"
28-04-2019T13:39:14,CrimsonQuill,No real reason except it's something I am studying as part of surverying.
28-04-2019T13:39:42,CrimsonQuill,And I think a VERY condensed explaination might be interesting...if I explain it in a way that doesn't make you fall asleep.
28-04-2019T14:07:17,CrimsonQuill,Did I kill the converstion before it even started? :ptv-uneasy:`:ptv-scratch:
28-04-2019T14:08:13,Twokinds,?
28-04-2019T14:08:22,CrimsonQuill,Ummm....
28-04-2019T14:08:27,Twokinds,Sorry I had to get coffee
28-04-2019T14:08:32,CrimsonQuill,Oh i see.
28-04-2019T14:08:38,Twokinds,I just woke up
28-04-2019T14:08:38,CrimsonQuill,It's fine
28-04-2019T14:08:58,CrimsonQuill,"And in all honesty, let's leave Geodesy."
28-04-2019T14:09:05,CrimsonQuill,I still don't understand it yet.
28-04-2019T14:09:11,CrimsonQuill,I have a better question...
28-04-2019T14:09:16,Mippy,Good morning :ctwokinds-katwet:
28-04-2019T14:09:28,CrimsonQuill,Hello mippy. :ptv-greetings:
28-04-2019T14:10:13,CrimsonQuill,"Tom, what site would you recommend for a start up Webcomic? Because my sister is creating one called ""Edgewalker"", and she's hoping to start putting it up in the next year or so."
28-04-2019T14:10:25,CrimsonQuill,I was wondering if you could give some advice I could pass on to her...
28-04-2019T14:10:30,CrimsonQuill,Plesase?
28-04-2019T14:10:32,CrimsonQuill,Please?
28-04-2019T14:10:42,CrimsonQuill,"Sorry, bad spelling"
28-04-2019T14:10:49,Mippy,Was up almost 24 hours
28-04-2019T14:11:14,CrimsonQuill,What the heck Mippy!
28-04-2019T14:12:27,Twokinds,Uh
28-04-2019T14:13:05,Mippy,Had to open shop at work yesterday so I was up at 4am and then I went to see Endgame...the late show...so I did not get to bed until 2am this morning

28-04-2019T14:13:47,CrimsonQuill,So...um...Tom...any suggestions? :ptv-scratch:
28-04-2019T14:13:51,Mippy,"Don‚Äôt worry, I won‚Äôt spoil anything"
28-04-2019T14:14:01,Twokinds,Would you give me one minute to think
28-04-2019T14:14:07,Twokinds,Jesus
28-04-2019T14:14:10,CrimsonQuill,"Sorry, Sorry!"
28-04-2019T14:14:15,CrimsonQuill,I didn't mean to rush it!
28-04-2019T14:14:21,CrimsonQuill,:ptv-uneasy:
28-04-2019T14:14:43,Twokinds,The easiest way would probably to go with either Webtoons or Tapas.
28-04-2019T14:15:02,CrimsonQuill,I've heard of Tapas...what's Webtoons?
28-04-2019T14:15:31,CrimsonQuill,"Wait, just seen."
28-04-2019T14:15:33,CrimsonQuill,I see.
28-04-2019T14:15:36,CrimsonQuill,Interesting.
28-04-2019T14:15:41,CrimsonQuill,"I'll pass it on, thanks."
28-04-2019T14:15:45,CrimsonQuill,One more question...
28-04-2019T14:16:05,CrimsonQuill,Would you suggest maintaining a presence on Keenspot once she's got it up and running?
28-04-2019T14:16:35,Twokinds,What are you talking about.
28-04-2019T14:16:43,TerraTheWizard,hmm
28-04-2019T14:16:44,CrimsonQuill,Sorry again
28-04-2019T14:16:47,CrimsonQuill,Too confusing
28-04-2019T14:16:52,CrimsonQuill,I'll clarify
28-04-2019T14:16:57,TerraTheWizard,what's even the question here?
28-04-2019T14:17:06,CrimsonQuill,I'm trying to get info for my sister
28-04-2019T14:17:12,CrimsonQuill,She wants to start a webcomic
28-04-2019T14:17:12,TerraTheWizard,about?
28-04-2019T14:17:16,TerraTheWizard,oh
28-04-2019T14:17:29,CrimsonQuill,And I've asked Tom for starter sites
28-04-2019T14:17:44,TerraTheWizard,there are a ton of places worth posting
28-04-2019T14:17:58,TerraTheWizard,webtoon/tapas/deviantart/tumblr
28-04-2019T14:18:04,CrimsonQuill,"Now, I am asking should one stick to the site they started from when the comic takes off, or is Keenspot a good goal."
28-04-2019T14:18:05,TerraTheWizard,"heck, even twitter"
28-04-2019T14:18:26,TerraTheWizard,why though
28-04-2019T14:18:27,CrimsonQuill,It's just that I am poor at phrasing questions.
28-04-2019T14:18:55,TerraTheWizard,nothing wrong wit just sticking to the sites i listed
28-04-2019T14:18:58,CrimsonQuill,I suppose the reason I am so obsessed with the Keenspot idea is that it's the site I found my first two webcomics on.
28-04-2019T14:18:59,Mippy,So....I got a new door knob :ctwokinds-kingtea:
28-04-2019T14:19:02,TerraTheWizard,"don't need a ""goal"" site"
28-04-2019T14:19:05,CrimsonQuill,Ok
28-04-2019T14:19:18,TerraTheWizard,if anything the goal would be self-hosting
28-04-2019T14:19:24,Twokinds,That's a personal choice.
28-04-2019T14:19:36,CrimsonQuill,I see.
28-04-2019T14:19:39,CrimsonQuill,"Ok, thanks"
28-04-2019T14:19:43,CrimsonQuill,I shall tell her
28-04-2019T14:19:50,CrimsonQuill,She's shown me the pages that she's prepared
28-04-2019T14:19:57,CrimsonQuill,They take ages for her to colour though
28-04-2019T14:19:58,Twokinds,Having your own website is probably the best option
28-04-2019T14:20:02,CrimsonQuill,Ok
28-04-2019T14:20:11,Twokinds,"You won't get any money from Tapas or Webtoons, probably."
28-04-2019T14:20:20,Twokinds,You'd only get what you could sell in merch or Patreon.
28-04-2019T14:20:22,Twokinds,etc.
28-04-2019T14:20:57,CrimsonQuill,I see.
28-04-2019T14:21:11,CrimsonQuill,"Well, thanks for that."
28-04-2019T14:21:27,CrimsonQuill,I hope I wasn't too confusing...
28-04-2019T14:22:01,CrimsonQuill,She's just replied on Messenger-she sends her thanks
28-04-2019T14:24:11,CrimsonQuill,"Now, back to the doorknob..."
28-04-2019T14:24:55,CrimsonQuill,tells themself to shut up.
28-04-2019T14:25:48,CrimsonQuill,I keep trying to fill the silence...

28-04-2019T16:47:14,Mippy,Got a minor headache...but that‚Äôs because I was up for almost 24 hours
28-04-2019T16:49:15,SpazztasticKiwi,I just had a small stroke. Look just slightly to the left and there‚Äôs a wasp at my window like he wants to tell me about our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
28-04-2019T16:49:41,SpazztasticKiwi,My scream echoed across the parking lot and the lady in the car behind me now thinks I‚Äôm mental
28-04-2019T16:52:02,Mippy,Lol....I had to be up for work at 4am yesterday and did not get to bed until 2am today because my dad wanted to see Endgame
