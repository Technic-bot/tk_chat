16-04-2019T00:21:18,Bgrmystr2,even doing a search results in nothing
16-04-2019T00:21:25,Bgrmystr2,so.. not even the internet knows what you're on about xD
16-04-2019T00:22:44,SpazztasticKiwi,https://youtu.be/RjMzXykfbm8
16-04-2019T00:23:06,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs old and that‚Äôs the summary name I see
16-04-2019T00:23:26,SpazztasticKiwi,came across it on a try not to cry on FBE
16-04-2019T00:24:55,Bgrmystr2,uh..huh
16-04-2019T00:34:37,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm not terribly exciting when it comes to random stuff I find
16-04-2019T00:57:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I have had a big binge on comedian clips lately though

16-04-2019T01:50:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Night everyone
16-04-2019T01:50:47,Bgrmystr2,"gnight then, ya quitters :)"
16-04-2019T01:51:09,Dadrobit,o/
16-04-2019T02:26:48,Dadrobit,"Oh, Tom. Dunno if yo're still here or not, but you should probably canonize Flora's actual age that she was captured in the character sheet. There are a couple separate versions of when she was captured currently."
16-04-2019T02:26:53,Dadrobit,you're*
16-04-2019T02:48:01,Twokinds,?
16-04-2019T02:48:22,Twokinds,What age was she captured?
16-04-2019T02:53:54,Dadrobit,"Sorry, I'm looking for the discrepancy now. I'm looking for a conversation amenon and I had concerning Flora's value where a few issues with her character were brought up and the capture age was up in the air."
16-04-2019T02:56:22,Dadrobit,"I know one of the possible ages came from the character sheet, but that was kind of unreliable even back then."
16-04-2019T02:58:26,Dadrobit,"It was/is 3 there, but it also talks about how she was only an indentured servant, and that she was released instead of escaped."
16-04-2019T03:00:32,Dadrobit,But I can't for the life of me find the other age discussion. Could have sworn it said in the comic she was 4. Made more sense than the character sheet's 3 and no memor since she does have some memories before her capture relating to her tribe's culture.
16-04-2019T03:01:25,Twokinds,Which character sheet?
16-04-2019T03:01:42,Dadrobit,http://twokinds.keenspot.com/characters/
16-04-2019T03:02:12,Dadrobit,memory*
16-04-2019T03:03:15,Twokinds,I think four is more likely
16-04-2019T03:06:17,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I get that the trauma of her capture mihgt be something she clocked out, but before that she was old enough at least for her mother to talk to her about estrus stuffs and have her remember it."
16-04-2019T03:06:23,Dadrobit,blocked*
16-04-2019T03:06:59,Dadrobit,"And especially going off of the Maeve age chart, 3 is barely old enough to stand on two legs, probably not the intended age for that conversation."
16-04-2019T03:14:12,Twokinds,It's not exactly taboo to talk about XD
16-04-2019T03:15:28,Twokinds,"But yeah, probably a little older makes more sense."
16-04-2019T03:15:33,Twokinds,I thought it was four.
16-04-2019T03:17:28,Dadrobit,"Yeah, same. Alas, perhaps I was hallucinating."
16-04-2019T03:18:07,Dadrobit,And I have too many damned conversations in my inbox to find the one with amenon concerning it.
16-04-2019T03:18:51,Twokinds,The ref sheet doesn't specify.
16-04-2019T03:19:13,Twokinds,I'm afraid to be specific so now I generally stick to being vague.
16-04-2019T03:19:24,Bgrmystr2,xD
16-04-2019T03:20:25,Dadrobit,Too many bastards like myself that vainly try to document every other word as gospel.
16-04-2019T03:31:17,Twokinds,lol
16-04-2019T03:33:15,iliar,You should also be glad that I know English too bad to read everything that the bot wrote down.
16-04-2019T03:33:45,Bgrmystr2,word of god is a thing.
16-04-2019T03:33:57,Bgrmystr2,Just cuz it's not consistant doesn't mean it ain't a thing xD
16-04-2019T03:36:17,iliar,"But I think, sooner or later I will find a way to systematize the ""words of god."""
