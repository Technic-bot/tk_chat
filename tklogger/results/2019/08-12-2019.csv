08-12-2019T21:14:49,Twokinds,Well he took them off to swim of course
08-12-2019T21:14:49,CrimsonHelsing,"Sorry, I needed some time"
08-12-2019T21:14:50,ThingsAreMoving,He lost them in a drinking accident
08-12-2019T21:15:02,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
08-12-2019T21:15:17,Twokinds,He hasn't figured out the nuance of specific human clothing like swimming trunks
08-12-2019T21:15:28,PalmettoPathfinder1,And I just imagined Lady Gaga as the voice of Flora.
08-12-2019T21:15:36,PalmettoPathfinder1,Anyone have any brain bleach?
08-12-2019T21:15:41,MoonDance,Loin cloths Andy swim trunks are a drag to wolves in swim time
08-12-2019T21:15:47,MoonDance,*and
08-12-2019T21:15:54,Ordithus,I'd think the tail is even more drag
08-12-2019T21:16:16,PalmettoPathfinder1,@Ordithus that would mean they would have to dock the wolves' tails.
08-12-2019T21:16:18,MoonDance,No that propel's
08-12-2019T21:16:48,Ordithus,No harming the floof tails

08-12-2019T21:18:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I always hear'd Keith as Elizabeth Olsen
08-12-2019T21:18:21,CrimsonHelsing,"Ok guys, serious question, sorry if it's derailing anyone, but do you guys honestly want anything good for Trace and Flora, anything peaceful?"
08-12-2019T21:18:41,PalmettoPathfinder1,Well I do Crimson.
08-12-2019T21:18:48,johnnytho,lyn knoll or bust

08-12-2019T21:19:22,CrimsonHelsing,"Ok, well I just wanted to ask is all"
08-12-2019T21:19:40,ThingsAreMoving,"Trace feels like a token human in a furry comic, right now. At least for me."
08-12-2019T21:20:37,unsteddyphoenix,Need trace to turn evil
08-12-2019T21:21:09,ThingsAreMoving,or face some problems that would let him grow

08-12-2019T22:28:18,Ketzal,it might depend on which stream you're trying to access
08-12-2019T22:28:24,Ketzal,"it's a little weird with multistreams, apparently"
08-12-2019T22:28:33,SpazztasticKiwi,you must be approved on mobile if you’re on your phone and able to comment
08-12-2019T22:28:37,Ketzal,"most of the chat is coming up as still pending for me, depsite already being approved"
08-12-2019T22:28:43,CatzArt,this is really the only stream where ive noticed trolls. it never happens on other channels i watch
08-12-2019T22:28:50,unsteddyphoenix,weird
08-12-2019T22:28:51,CrimsonHelsing,ah so it's just being buggy on me
08-12-2019T22:29:01,MuonNeutrino,"tom is usually the largest stream on picarto when he's live, at least as far as i've seen"
08-12-2019T22:29:02,ThingsAreMoving,It's the most popular one most of the time
08-12-2019T22:29:04,CatzArt,guess you guys are special or just unlucky :p
08-12-2019T22:29:04,Ordithus,Viewer count.  Anyways don't talk about trolls
08-12-2019T22:29:07,Ketzal,spend a long enough time on any stream and you'll se em
08-12-2019T22:29:09,Ketzal,see*
08-12-2019T22:29:09,CatzArt,okay
08-12-2019T22:29:38,CatzArt,well back to studying. i got a final tomorrow. may god have mercy on my soul
08-12-2019T22:29:43,CrimsonHelsing,"well I hope it can be fixed soon, cuz I need to be able to talk on mobile"
08-12-2019T22:29:43,MuonNeutrino,good luck!
08-12-2019T22:29:44,Ketzal,good luck
08-12-2019T22:29:47,Ordithus,"Just admire how pretty Naoki is, how happy Ember is, and Mike's butt"
08-12-2019T22:29:52,ThingsAreMoving,Raine's hair was just raving there in the water
08-12-2019T22:29:54,ThingsAreMoving,lol
08-12-2019T22:29:55,Ketzal,crimson: what stream you trying to access?
08-12-2019T22:29:56,Kameloh,XD
08-12-2019T22:30:04,CatzArt,yup one more final and then i get to graduate college
08-12-2019T22:30:05,Ketzal,on mobile that is
08-12-2019T22:30:16,Kameloh,ord I added clothes -- I have a feeling it was influenced by w0lf
08-12-2019T22:30:20,CrimsonHelsing,Tom's
08-12-2019T22:30:24,w0lfmare,:cw0lfmare-HeadEmber:

08-12-2019T22:30:34,Ordithus,w0lf wasn't even there the first time you put clothes on her!
08-12-2019T22:30:38,SpazztasticKiwi,so angry at pants
08-12-2019T22:30:40,Ordithus,I think...
08-12-2019T22:30:44,Titanarisium,Buffering!!
08-12-2019T22:30:44,unsteddyphoenix,pants are the ENEMY
08-12-2019T22:30:47,Kameloh,:ckameloh-naokipaper:*[uh oh]
08-12-2019T22:30:50,w0lfmare,The peer pressure is finally working
08-12-2019T22:30:55,Ketzal,pfft
08-12-2019T22:31:03,SpazztasticKiwi,do not badmouth the pants
08-12-2019T22:31:07,MuonNeutrino,what subject is the final?
08-12-2019T22:31:11,SpazztasticKiwi,they will rise and attack us all
08-12-2019T22:31:13,CrimsonHelsing,@Ketzal I mean I'm trying to chat on Tom's stream
08-12-2019T22:31:29,ThingsAreMoving,but you do
08-12-2019T22:31:37,CrimsonHelsing,via pc
08-12-2019T22:31:40,CrimsonHelsing,for now
08-12-2019T22:31:58,ThingsAreMoving,"oh, that's what it is"
08-12-2019T22:32:03,CrimsonHelsing,had to so I could clear up the issue
08-12-2019T22:32:06,Ketzal,"then he probably hasn't approved your request yet, if I had to guess"
08-12-2019T22:32:15,Ketzal,try joining w0lf's stream and see if it changes
08-12-2019T22:33:17,SpazztasticKiwi,"if Toms chat merged with one or more people, you think the whitelist blankets them once they’re merged?"
08-12-2019T22:33:31,Ketzal,I don't think so
08-12-2019T22:33:37,CrimsonHelsing,"no dice, for some reason I'm not approved"
08-12-2019T22:33:50,Ketzal,well you gotta give w0lf a minute to approve you XD
08-12-2019T22:34:07,ThingsAreMoving,Have you tried to log off on PC and then log in on mobile?
08-12-2019T22:34:20,CrimsonHelsing,I'll try
08-12-2019T22:35:46,ThingsAreMoving,"Heck, almost 4 am over here."
08-12-2019T22:35:59,MuonNeutrino,"ya know, i wonder if there'll actually even be any dialog in this page"
08-12-2019T22:36:02,ThingsAreMoving,Feels good not having to go away because of the late time :ctwokinds-rainehappy:
08-12-2019T22:36:12,MuonNeutrino,it's the sort of thing that looks like it'd flow without any words at all
08-12-2019T22:36:33,SpazztasticKiwi,almost like it’s a comic page
08-12-2019T22:36:34,ThingsAreMoving,I feel like the volleyball panel needs some snarky remarks from Maren
08-12-2019T22:36:39,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-rainehappy: yay!
08-12-2019T22:36:58,CrimsonHelsing,"no dice, same results"
08-12-2019T22:37:08,SpazztasticKiwi,you have to be on the list - how else are you chatting on web - and is there any difference between being on mobile or web if it’s the same stream whitelist
08-12-2019T22:37:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I is a heckin confuse
08-12-2019T22:37:27,CrimsonHelsing,"idk how, but I guess it is a different whitelist"
08-12-2019T22:37:39,ThingsAreMoving,"Picarto be working in mysterious ways, it seems"
08-12-2019T22:37:50,CrimsonHelsing,"and somehow I'm not on there ,':\"
08-12-2019T22:37:53,Ordithus,I don't think we'll figure it out.  Whitelist seems to be somewhat glitchy probably
08-12-2019T22:38:09,MuonNeutrino,wonder whose snorkel
08-12-2019T22:38:20,CrimsonHelsing,"well it goes without saying, this whitelist bug is really nasty"
08-12-2019T22:39:24,CrimsonHelsing,"at least mobile doesn't crash like it used to, and prompt me to send a bug report multiple times"
08-12-2019T22:39:50,w0lfmare,I've never liked the app very much
08-12-2019T22:39:58,w0lfmare,So many issues
08-12-2019T22:40:06,johnnytho,i like the veldt :(

08-12-2019T22:40:49,MuonNeutrino,i haven't been able to get the picarto app to work in ages
08-12-2019T22:40:52,CrimsonHelsing,"the app, so I don't have to have the browser on. eats my cpu alive, can't play fallout 4 with the browser on"
08-12-2019T22:40:55,MuonNeutrino,on my phone i have to open it in the browser

08-12-2019T22:44:38,ThingsAreMoving,I know right! I'm surprised they had WinAmp back then
08-12-2019T22:44:50,MuonNeutrino,i likewise read all of freefall in one day when i discovered it
08-12-2019T22:45:05,SpazztasticKiwi,lots of Beethoven
08-12-2019T22:45:07,Ordithus,"How, that comic is like 1 million pages"
08-12-2019T22:45:08,Kameloh,Freefall is one of my first and favorite comics that I'v eread
08-12-2019T22:45:12,MuonNeutrino,i read fast ^^
08-12-2019T22:45:21,Ordithus,It took me a month
08-12-2019T22:45:25,ThingsAreMoving,"Freefall only has 3 panels, it's a fast read"
08-12-2019T22:45:31,MuonNeutrino,also i started reading it in like 2011 or something so likewise there weren't as many when i started
08-12-2019T22:45:35,ThingsAreMoving,per comic page that is
08-12-2019T22:45:55,unsteddyphoenix,Lol ok that makes more sense
