04-09-2019T02:59:35,AspiringNoodle,*siiiiiiiiiiiigh*  Ofc this wouldn't be THAT easy :ptv-unimpressed:
04-09-2019T03:00:19,AspiringNoodle,"Alright, since I'm gonna have grade A insomnia for the night, anyone got something interesting to talk about?"
04-09-2019T05:35:43,CrimsonQuill,Good Morning
04-09-2019T06:21:18,SomeNiceUser,Good morning.
04-09-2019T06:22:28,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-kingtea:
04-09-2019T06:30:16,AspiringNoodle,Morning
04-09-2019T06:30:20,AspiringNoodle,I'm hungry :ptv-hearts:
04-09-2019T06:31:30,TerraTheWizard,hi hungry :ctwokinds-keith8D:
04-09-2019T06:32:26,AspiringNoodle,I find it slightly annoying that I need to do training for work while I'm sick
04-09-2019T06:32:38,AspiringNoodle,"The first one was okay, since it took 30 - 40 minutes"
04-09-2019T06:32:49,AspiringNoodle,But now I need to do a 4-hour training session?
04-09-2019T06:35:18,TerraTheWizard,oof
04-09-2019T06:38:02,AspiringNoodle,"I rarely get sick, tbh"
04-09-2019T06:38:11,AspiringNoodle,"Maybe the minor cold once a year, but that's it"
04-09-2019T06:38:49,AspiringNoodle,"But I am now in day 5 of still being sick (voice is still very noticeably affected), cough, trouble sleeping"
04-09-2019T06:39:14,AspiringNoodle,And this is also day 4 of being on drugs (2 of the amped up antibiotics)
04-09-2019T06:46:03,CrimsonQuill,How long d'you think it's going to last?
04-09-2019T06:46:52,AspiringNoodle,"No idea, the doctor was slightly concerned that I had a low grade fever after 2 days of antibiotics"
04-09-2019T06:47:06,AspiringNoodle,First visit: 2 days offs
04-09-2019T06:47:09,AspiringNoodle,Second visit: 5
04-09-2019T06:49:00,AspiringNoodle,"Part of me wants to get it over with, go in for the 4 hours, and then enjoy the full length of the doctor's note"
04-09-2019T06:50:38,AspiringNoodle,"My whining aside, everyone having a good week so far?"
04-09-2019T06:51:07,AspiringNoodle,Let's drown out this wall of text with more pleasant / humorous conversation :ptv-hearts:
04-09-2019T06:56:35,CrimsonQuill,So far it's going ok
04-09-2019T06:56:45,CrimsonQuill,The only thing I'm worried about is my fancomic thing
04-09-2019T06:57:05,CrimsonQuill,"Because, A: I am suffering severe procrastination on my OC Reference sheets..."
04-09-2019T06:57:48,CrimsonQuill,"And B: I am worried about the fulcrum on which this project is built on, that being the fact that one of the main characters is Raine, and therefore I want to make absolutely sure that Tom's ok with his character being used in such a project."
04-09-2019T06:58:13,CrimsonQuill,"And C: Everytime I ask him in the chat, i scare him with a wall of text."
04-09-2019T06:58:55,CrimsonQuill,Like just now
04-09-2019T06:59:03,CrimsonQuill,Dammit I did it again
04-09-2019T06:59:09,CrimsonQuill,:ptv-scratch::ptv-uneasy:
04-09-2019T07:04:20,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-awoo:
04-09-2019T07:04:31,CrimsonQuill,Awwoooooo
04-09-2019T07:06:18,SomeNiceUser,I’m just happy that my package is now in Arrival scan phase.
04-09-2019T07:07:09,SomeNiceUser,And now I have to bring my pupper for a blood test at the vet clinic.
04-09-2019T07:07:34,SomeNiceUser,Funny that he’s chill with it.
04-09-2019T07:11:23,CrimsonQuill,Our dogs hate going to the vet.
04-09-2019T07:26:56,CrimsonQuill,They always think that they'll be taken back to the shelter or something.
04-09-2019T07:43:22,SomeNiceUser,"I just learned that he hates the vet, oops."
04-09-2019T07:49:47,AspiringNoodle,Friggin' great :ptv-unimpressed:
04-09-2019T07:49:55,CrimsonQuill,Oooooh dear
04-09-2019T07:50:01,AspiringNoodle,Just had a random nosebleed out of my left nostril
04-09-2019T07:50:15,AspiringNoodle,"After stopping it and cleaning up, took a shower."
04-09-2019T07:50:35,AspiringNoodle,"Coughed a bit too hard while in there.  Can confirm BOTH nostrils are prone to nosebleeds now, because f*ck getting better, amirite?"
04-09-2019T07:51:37,AspiringNoodle,"Also, doggos, don't hate the vet, they just want to help you :ptv-whiny:"
04-09-2019T07:52:21,CrimsonQuill,"I had chronic nosebleeds at one point. Sneezed a bit to hard, it all came out. Had to go to the hospital for cauterization."
04-09-2019T07:52:34,AspiringNoodle,Fun!
04-09-2019T07:52:49,CrimsonQuill,The anasthetic tasted vile
04-09-2019T07:52:54,AspiringNoodle,Mine are just more annoying.  They are prone to start if my BP gets a smidge too high in the noggin'
04-09-2019T07:52:59,CrimsonQuill,And made my mouth and nose feel weird.
04-09-2019T07:53:13,CrimsonQuill,"Blood pressure? Oh crumbs, that's even worses."
04-09-2019T07:53:24,AspiringNoodle,I can stop them easily.  But they start just as easily -_-
04-09-2019T07:53:55,AspiringNoodle,"Don't worry too much, it's related to the coughing / exertion"
04-09-2019T07:54:08,CrimsonQuill,ok
04-09-2019T07:54:20,AspiringNoodle,I'm more concered about why the LEFT nostril started bleeding TODAY
04-09-2019T07:54:39,AspiringNoodle,The right one is explainable.  On Tuesday I had a coughing fit that was going so hard that it caused me to vomit
04-09-2019T07:54:55,AspiringNoodle,And then that caused me to exert myself so much that it triggered the first nosebleed
04-09-2019T07:55:52,CrimsonQuill,Nasty.
04-09-2019T07:56:18,AspiringNoodle,"If Tony calls about the training, I'll have to tell him straight up that I've already had 3 nosebleeds today"
04-09-2019T07:56:47,AspiringNoodle,"Because my left nostril decided today was a good day to start bleeding for no reason.  And because it's an overachiever / competitive with the right, it had to bleed twice out of the gate"
04-09-2019T07:57:26,CrimsonQuill,Oh that's bad.
04-09-2019T07:58:26,AspiringNoodle,Yeah :/
04-09-2019T07:58:49,AspiringNoodle,Doesn't matter if it's 4 hours of sitting on my butt doing training from a website / paperwork
04-09-2019T07:59:22,AspiringNoodle,"The fact that I'm getting these things from things I can do while sitting down is problematic, to say the leaste"
04-09-2019T07:59:56,CrimsonQuill,It might need cauterization.
04-09-2019T08:00:12,CrimsonQuill,Blood vessels in the nose sometimes swell and become prone to bleeding.
04-09-2019T08:00:21,CrimsonQuill,That and the high blood pressure....
04-09-2019T08:00:41,CrimsonQuill,"I don't know this from any training or course btw, the Doctor told me about this stuff."
04-09-2019T08:01:17,AspiringNoodle,Let me check some charts from my last physical earlier this year
04-09-2019T08:01:34,AspiringNoodle,I think my blood pressure might have gone up while my weight has remained the same / dropped
04-09-2019T08:03:32,CrimsonQuill,Oh crumbs
04-09-2019T08:03:39,AspiringNoodle,"Okay, so from my physical"
04-09-2019T08:04:22,AspiringNoodle,BMI has shifted from 38.47 -> 37.1
04-09-2019T08:04:36,AspiringNoodle,Blood pressure at physical: 130 / 84
04-09-2019T08:04:48,CrimsonQuill,...
04-09-2019T08:04:50,CrimsonQuill,Not good
04-09-2019T08:04:57,CrimsonQuill,In the BP dept.
04-09-2019T08:05:00,AspiringNoodle,Blood Pressure yesterday: 142 / 96
04-09-2019T08:05:17,CrimsonQuill,:ptv-confused:
04-09-2019T08:05:31,AspiringNoodle,So I've lost a bit over 10 lbs
04-09-2019T08:05:41,AspiringNoodle,But my BP has jumped from stage 1 hypertension levels to stage 2
04-09-2019T08:06:58,CrimsonQuill,"Yep, that seems like you need to see a Doctor."
04-09-2019T08:07:36,AspiringNoodle,"Once this illness finally blows over, I'll keep an eye on things, and then make an appointment 2 - 4 weeks later"
04-09-2019T08:08:03,AspiringNoodle,"Realistically, my BP should have dropped with the weight, so it's possible this is tied to the illness"
04-09-2019T08:08:26,CrimsonQuill,Perhaps..I wouldn't know myself.
04-09-2019T08:08:41,AspiringNoodle,Losing weight is one of the best ways to lower your blood pressure
04-09-2019T08:10:46,CrimsonQuill,Oh
04-09-2019T08:10:49,CrimsonQuill,Got to go for a bit
04-09-2019T08:10:52,CrimsonQuill,Be back in a bit
04-09-2019T08:10:56,AspiringNoodle,Cya later :D
04-09-2019T08:32:55,SomeNiceUser,I’m here!
04-09-2019T08:34:56,AspiringNoodle,*boots SNU into bottomless pit*
04-09-2019T08:34:57,AspiringNoodle,Nope :P
04-09-2019T08:35:37,SomeNiceUser,disappears into the dark abyss.
04-09-2019T09:24:19,TerraTheWizard,anyone know where the coloured version of https://www.patreon.com/posts/marens-thoughts-25413177 is?
04-09-2019T09:24:48,TerraTheWizard,i have a clip of maren's face from it coloured but i can't find the whole thing
04-09-2019T09:35:35,TerraTheWizard,"wait, are there still unposted nora cards?"
04-09-2019T09:43:44,TerraTheWizard,"never mind about that maren one, turns out it was just a really good fan colour"
04-09-2019T09:56:32,Viizl,"Well there's the Kat one, one being evil and one being Kat, that didnt got posted. Way back in february or so"
04-09-2019T10:04:06,TerraTheWizard,was going through vods to find that colour that turned out to be unofficial
04-09-2019T10:04:17,TerraTheWizard,found the natani dress shirt one that's not been posted yet
04-09-2019T13:49:09,AspiringNoodle,I wanted to make a joke about whatever is inside me needs to flip off and die
04-09-2019T13:49:22,AspiringNoodle,"But I'm worried it will reply: ""Okay, but I'm taking me with you."""

04-09-2019T15:06:24,SpazztasticKiwi,hai Tom

04-09-2019T16:06:09,tehbear,has Tom given any details of what the Sam and Colin comic might be about?
04-09-2019T16:06:44,TerraTheWizard,nope
04-09-2019T16:06:49,tehbear,"from what i remember, its set in a modern world not to different from ours"
04-09-2019T16:18:50,SomeNiceUser,Modern Twokinds.
04-09-2019T16:19:17,CrimsonQuill,Whooof
04-09-2019T16:19:27,CrimsonQuill,Drawing is fun but tricky
04-09-2019T16:19:47,CrimsonQuill,"I've just been trying to get the hang of doodling my OC Luke Adams, and Raine headshots."
04-09-2019T16:22:32,CrimsonQuill,Maybe I might try drawing Trace too. I like the idea.
04-09-2019T16:22:47,CrimsonQuill,Perhaps in the midst of his madness...slaughtering all before him...
04-09-2019T16:22:59,FloofyCat,Draw the trace but don't trace the trace
04-09-2019T16:23:08,FloofyCat,I just wanted an excuse to say trace the trace.
04-09-2019T16:23:12,CrimsonQuill,I will never stoop to that level.
04-09-2019T16:23:27,CrimsonQuill,I have heard of the nightmare that is project 2nd.
04-09-2019T16:23:34,FloofyCat,PFFFFT
04-09-2019T16:23:48,CrimsonQuill,"Actually, it's been a long time since I drew Daleks..."
04-09-2019T16:24:10,CrimsonQuill,Perhaps that Dalek-vs-Star Trek crossover I have in my brain...
04-09-2019T16:24:20,FloofyCat,"Just draw a pepper grinder pot shaker thing, a plunger, whisker and smaller plunger."
04-09-2019T16:24:42,CrimsonQuill,"Well, I'm good at drawing them. They're very fun."
04-09-2019T16:24:49,CrimsonQuill,'EXTERMINATE'
04-09-2019T16:25:10,TerraTheWizard,daleks are reverse cheese graters with a toilet plunger on the top
04-09-2019T16:25:31,CrimsonQuill,I want to see the Doctor tremble in fear at the mere mention of the name.
04-09-2019T16:25:36,CrimsonQuill,The trouble is
04-09-2019T16:25:54,CrimsonQuill,"The longer they're there, the harder it is to do new scary things with them."
04-09-2019T16:26:09,CrimsonQuill,And as children watch it you can't really SHOW the full horror...
04-09-2019T16:26:49,TerraTheWizard,daleks were broken because they couldn't stairs
04-09-2019T16:26:53,TerraTheWizard,so they made them float
04-09-2019T16:27:00,CrimsonQuill,'ELEVATE;
04-09-2019T16:27:05,TerraTheWizard,then cybermen
04-09-2019T16:27:05,CrimsonQuill,Brilliant decision.
04-09-2019T16:27:07,TerraTheWizard,they were slow
04-09-2019T16:27:20,TerraTheWizard,and i can't remember how they fixed that
04-09-2019T16:27:29,CrimsonQuill,Cybermen cannot beat the Daleks...They'd give them a good fight but they'd fall in the end
04-09-2019T16:27:31,TerraTheWizard,there was at least one that had super speed
04-09-2019T16:27:44,CrimsonQuill,Niel Gaiman gave them super speed when he wrote 'Nightmare in Silver'
04-09-2019T16:37:32,TerraTheWizard,so having a wisdom tooth out was nowhere near as bad as everyone says it is
04-09-2019T16:38:22,CrimsonQuill,Oh
04-09-2019T16:38:30,CrimsonQuill,"Still, it must be a LITTLE painful."
04-09-2019T16:38:37,tehbear,guess it depends
04-09-2019T16:39:37,TerraTheWizard,just my jaw is slightly sore if i open my mouth wide
04-09-2019T16:39:44,TerraTheWizard,and there's an occasional headache
04-09-2019T16:39:46,SomeNiceUser,"I had to remove my wisdom teeth because one of them was about to sprout veins into the nerves, if it did, I would have a half paralyzed face."
04-09-2019T16:40:10,TerraTheWizard,oof
04-09-2019T16:41:05,TerraTheWizard,the worst part of the whole thing was the sound of it being taken out
04-09-2019T16:41:24,SomeNiceUser,Yup.
04-09-2019T16:41:25,CrimsonQuill,"Oh, the noise..."
04-09-2019T16:41:28,tehbear,nope nope nope
04-09-2019T16:41:43,tehbear,note to self: book dentist appointment this year
04-09-2019T16:42:11,TerraTheWizard,also i'm always surprised at the number of people that don't regularly go to the dentist for a checkup
04-09-2019T16:42:15,SomeNiceUser,I had to use text to speech for a good two to three day.
04-09-2019T16:42:18,TerraTheWizard,i'm there every 6 months
04-09-2019T16:43:35,SomeNiceUser,I once had to be put under for a surgery.
04-09-2019T16:43:36,tehbear,did you use the steven hawking voice?
04-09-2019T16:44:11,SomeNiceUser,"Sadly no bear, it would of been great if I thought of that."
04-09-2019T16:44:18,TerraTheWizard,good ol' microsoft sam
04-09-2019T16:44:41,SomeNiceUser,Lol
04-09-2019T16:44:49,tehbear,should have used a speak and spell
04-09-2019T16:45:53,SniperJackal,"@TerraTheWizard if you re surprised at people not going for a regular checkup, you d scream at me"
04-09-2019T16:45:54,SomeNiceUser,"Also, please take care of your hands, I broke my writing hand early this year."
04-09-2019T16:46:00,TerraTheWizard,you have disappointed huh-oh-muh-eh-urr

04-09-2019T16:46:48,CrimsonQuill,He loved Season 8
04-09-2019T16:47:02,CrimsonQuill,And keeps humming 'When your middle name is danger'
04-09-2019T16:47:02,SniperJackal,season 8 was the best yeah
04-09-2019T16:47:13,SniperJackal,@tehbear yup rvb
04-09-2019T16:47:18,CrimsonQuill,"'Alright, Who's first?2"
04-09-2019T16:47:21,CrimsonQuill,""""
04-09-2019T16:48:12,TerraTheWizard,speaking of seasons
04-09-2019T16:48:23,tehbear,seasons are a changing
04-09-2019T16:48:24,TerraTheWizard,disenchantment part 2 is out on the 20th
04-09-2019T16:48:33,tehbear,looking forwards to it!
04-09-2019T16:48:42,CrimsonQuill,Colder
04-09-2019T16:48:55,tehbear,"it wasnt futurama quality, but still pretty decent"
04-09-2019T16:48:56,CrimsonQuill,"Wooly jumper time will be upon us within a few months,"
04-09-2019T16:49:23,TerraTheWizard,so many people were angry about it not being as good as futurama
04-09-2019T16:49:31,TerraTheWizard,but there are 2 thigns about that
04-09-2019T16:49:42,TerraTheWizard,1) it's a continuous story
04-09-2019T16:49:52,TerraTheWizard,and 2) futurama is one of the best animated shows ever
04-09-2019T16:50:11,tehbear,its a hard act to follow
04-09-2019T16:50:25,TerraTheWizard,"so good it got cancelled like 4 times, lol"
04-09-2019T16:50:34,SniperJackal,its good that its getting colder
04-09-2019T16:50:39,SniperJackal,I dont like extreme heat
04-09-2019T16:50:47,tehbear,i remember you like woolys Quill
04-09-2019T16:51:04,CrimsonQuill,10 Aran-knit jumpers
04-09-2019T16:51:09,CrimsonQuill,And about 15 others

04-09-2019T16:53:12,tehbear,looks like an black cat within an orange cat
04-09-2019T16:53:24,SniperJackal,I think its a Siamese
04-09-2019T16:53:35,CrimsonQuill,"No, she's a moggie"
04-09-2019T16:54:11,SniperJackal,I really want to get a cat at some point
04-09-2019T16:54:28,SniperJackal,Need someone to lay in my lap or on the keyboard hahah
04-09-2019T16:55:22,tehbear,esp. on the keyboard if you have a laptop
04-09-2019T16:55:36,SniperJackal,handwarmer in the winter
04-09-2019T16:55:43,CrimsonQuill,:)
04-09-2019T16:55:46,SomeNiceUser,Indeed.
04-09-2019T16:55:47,CrimsonQuill,Cats are nice.
04-09-2019T16:56:06,SniperJackal,"they re like me, they take lots of naps"
04-09-2019T16:56:47,SomeNiceUser,"Laptops give warmth and they sit on your lap, same for cats."
04-09-2019T16:57:38,SomeNiceUser,But cats have fluff.
04-09-2019T16:57:53,CrimsonQuill,And purrs like motor cars.
04-09-2019T16:58:03,tehbear,or chainsaws
04-09-2019T16:58:19,tehbear,idleing chainsaws
04-09-2019T16:58:40,SomeNiceUser,"Tbh, there is lots in common between cats and laptops, it’s just weird."
04-09-2019T16:58:43,CrimsonQuill,XS
04-09-2019T16:58:46,CrimsonQuill,XD
04-09-2019T16:58:51,IronHorseComics,but laptops have this nasty habbit of overheating
04-09-2019T16:58:52,SniperJackal,cat = laptops
04-09-2019T16:59:02,IronHorseComics,and then their motherboards fry on you
04-09-2019T16:59:16,SomeNiceUser,"Laptops need charging constantly, same for cats."
04-09-2019T16:59:20,SniperJackal,except laptops cant give headbutts
04-09-2019T16:59:32,SniperJackal,except if you slam your head into it
04-09-2019T16:59:43,CrimsonQuill,'Maren Head Bump'
04-09-2019T16:59:50,SniperJackal,:D
04-09-2019T17:00:15,IronHorseComics,"heh, that was a fun suggestion to make"
04-09-2019T17:01:40,tehbear,the cats i had at home were quite violent with their headbumps
04-09-2019T17:01:57,tehbear,surprising how much force a little cat can headbump with
04-09-2019T17:02:20,tehbear,sometimes headbumping furniture and doors.
04-09-2019T17:02:34,CrimsonQuill,I'm going to bed.
04-09-2019T17:02:37,SomeNiceUser,There is a place I know that has so much cats. So much cat.

04-09-2019T17:19:49,tehbear,i worked a bit with the post. gathering letters and packages to the sorting and distribution senter
04-09-2019T17:20:50,tehbear,some post offices are more chaotic than others...
04-09-2019T17:24:29,tehbear,"if you got a notification that your delivery is delayed, at least the package is tracked"
04-09-2019T17:25:29,tehbear,all packages should be tracked regardless imo. we have the technology!
04-09-2019T17:43:35,SomeNiceUser,At least tracking exists.
