30-07-2019T18:39:43,SpazztasticKiwi,what would you guys consider a small order of cookies
30-07-2019T18:41:45,AspiringNoodle,Depends on size / quantity
30-07-2019T18:42:15,AspiringNoodle,"If they're the size of chocolate cookies made the way your mum likes, then 6 would probably count as ""small"""
30-07-2019T18:43:27,Dadrobit,"Yeah, half a dozen as an ""order"". Anything less and they're just picking up a few cookies that are on the premade rack I'd think?"
30-07-2019T18:48:58,SpazztasticKiwi,this lady just asked for a small order
30-07-2019T18:49:01,SpazztasticKiwi,600
30-07-2019T18:49:05,SpazztasticKiwi,she wants 600
30-07-2019T18:52:13,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm cuter news I woke up to both my cats curled together at the bottom of the bed

30-07-2019T19:36:52,AspiringNoodle,"And you should've clarified that ""small"" meant as in business orders, lol"
30-07-2019T19:37:17,AspiringNoodle,"And I'd argue that 600 is a mid-size order, depending on what it's for"
30-07-2019T19:52:42,Dadrobit,"Yeah, that's a small to mid sized order for someone throwing a party at a venue like a country club."
30-07-2019T19:53:23,Dadrobit,I was thinking you were asking about something like a guy getting a few custom cookies for his anniversary with his girlfriend.
30-07-2019T19:56:07,AspiringNoodle,Huh... I just learned something pretty damn need
30-07-2019T19:56:09,AspiringNoodle,neat*
30-07-2019T19:57:47,AspiringNoodle,"A windows computer' boot drive is limited to 2TB or 16TB, depending on whether it's using 512 byte or 4k byte sectors, respectively"
30-07-2019T19:58:20,CrRAR,lol
30-07-2019T19:58:34,CrRAR,too. much. math.
30-07-2019T19:58:44,CrRAR,to do with little sectors
30-07-2019T19:58:44,AspiringNoodle,"So if you plan on using an NVME drive for your boot disk, there's no real reason to go above 2tb (at least once they can make larger than that)"
30-07-2019T19:59:06,AspiringNoodle,I'm sure those 4k sectors might be on the professional side of things
30-07-2019T20:00:30,CrRAR,"It's a balance picking sector size, little sectors are better for lots of small file I/O, latge ones better for reading/writing larger files."
30-07-2019T20:01:13,CrRAR,A Windows volume is better with the smaller end for boot time/ OS operations.
30-07-2019T20:02:17,AspiringNoodle,"I'm still debating between 1Tb and 2TB for my computer, lol"
30-07-2019T20:02:42,AspiringNoodle,"2TB is as large as you can get with the m.2 form factor, at least for 2280 size."
30-07-2019T20:03:09,CrRAR,"I would just judge by what's a better deal per GB, you can always add storage drives."
30-07-2019T20:03:27,AspiringNoodle,"It's a bit of a weird situation, atm"
30-07-2019T20:04:01,AspiringNoodle,"Samsung's 970 EVO PLUS drives are $220 per 1TB, and I think $460 per 2TB, thought it was $500 for a long while"

30-07-2019T20:18:17,IronHorseComics,"so your walmart is the convenience store version, Kiwi?"
30-07-2019T20:31:00,Dadrobit,"I can't speak for WalMart, but the Albertson's I used to work for many years ago had a great bakery, everything that they sold was fresh made in store from scratch and it was all super good."
30-07-2019T20:32:25,IronHorseComics,"Food City makes great rotisserie chicken. As for the bakery... I honestly don't know, I never went for them even when the stores were Bi-Lo"
30-07-2019T20:34:34,SpazztasticKiwi,they‚Äôre setting basically everything where it‚Äôs just frozen and put out
30-07-2019T20:35:06,SpazztasticKiwi,the new cookies we baked are shipping new prepackaged in 3 and 13 counts
30-07-2019T20:35:33,SpazztasticKiwi,ship frozen - thawed for the shelf
30-07-2019T20:35:50,SpazztasticKiwi,we still bake bread though it‚Äôs shipped frozen raw
30-07-2019T20:36:26,SpazztasticKiwi,same for doughnuts and the hot case chicken & food (except for liquid vegetables)
30-07-2019T20:47:52,Dadrobit,"Nah, it was all fresh stuff with us. The bakery was like 25% of the store's physical area because of their giant back rooms with all their baking stuffs."
30-07-2019T20:48:19,Dadrobit,Fresh French Bread every couple hours got sent out to the end caps and made the store smell amazing.
30-07-2019T20:48:34,Dadrobit,And their sourdough loaves were to die for.

30-07-2019T22:01:42,Dadrobit,Their ghost pepper sauce is killer though. Great stuff.
30-07-2019T22:13:12,SpazztasticKiwi,what was with the kids menu question
30-07-2019T22:14:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I know I get misaged but you one of those ‚ÄúI thought you were 16‚Äù looking people too
30-07-2019T22:15:06,SpazztasticKiwi,"that point, it‚Äôs a case of ‚Äúadulthood is when you realize you can buy yourself a cake for no reason or eat out alone and there‚Äôs literally no one or thing stopping you‚Äù"
30-07-2019T22:24:48,Dadrobit,"I dunno, the lady was just... Very off putting about the whole thing. The ""Just you?!?"" question was given with a look of shock and the kids menu was offered with a smirk."
30-07-2019T22:25:14,Dadrobit,"And trust me, I haven't looked 16 since I was 15."
30-07-2019T22:25:53,Dadrobit,"Like, this lady was just fucking with me for legitimately no reason so far as I can tell."
30-07-2019T22:31:11,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôd say maybe she was trying the be mean if you like them angle of flirting but

30-07-2019T22:32:14,SpazztasticKiwi,"hot wings are the best of the three bone in, bbq‚Äôs best of the three boneless"
30-07-2019T22:32:47,SpazztasticKiwi,but if you just eat the chicken right from the fryer I swear they‚Äôre better without sauce
30-07-2019T22:34:15,Dadrobit,Maybe it was flirting? It was just awkward really.
30-07-2019T22:34:39,SpazztasticKiwi,not the kind you want to try dating if it was
30-07-2019T22:34:53,Dadrobit,And these were boneless wings. Wednesday is their deal on boneless. Half a pound for $3.50.
30-07-2019T22:35:05,SpazztasticKiwi,someone tried that with me first try I‚Äôm likely not gonna keep talking to em
30-07-2019T22:35:25,SpazztasticKiwi,our wings are $5.98/pound
30-07-2019T22:35:35,SpazztasticKiwi,everything goes by weight
30-07-2019T22:36:31,Dadrobit,"I think it's something like $6.50 for a pound, but I ended up getting two different orders, one of them to go."
30-07-2019T22:37:31,Dadrobit,"I prefer boneless, (unpopular opinion, I know). They're just easier to eat."
30-07-2019T22:42:53,SpazztasticKiwi,the main thing with boneless is the ‚Äúthe bones take up the weight‚Äù people
30-07-2019T22:43:15,SpazztasticKiwi,few ask if we can put the other sauces on the boneless
30-07-2019T22:43:18,SpazztasticKiwi,no
30-07-2019T22:43:28,SpazztasticKiwi,no we can‚Äôt
30-07-2019T22:44:08,SpazztasticKiwi,that crosses inventory and makes us a sause short and wing bag extra
30-07-2019T22:50:00,Bgrmystr2,can't people just.. buy an extra sauce of they want that sauce on w/e they buy?
30-07-2019T22:50:19,Bgrmystr2,if* asjklfhaksf
30-07-2019T22:51:00,SpazztasticKiwi,nope
30-07-2019T22:51:26,Bgrmystr2,"see, that's bad business imo. I don't see any reason to refuse people the ability to buy extra sauces."
30-07-2019T22:52:01,SpazztasticKiwi,sauce comes with per bag in the boxes
30-07-2019T22:52:20,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs hot case items for hot sale
30-07-2019T22:52:44,Bgrmystr2,"Every time I end up getting pizza or whatnot, I get two garlic sauces instead of whatever the garbage sauce they're supposed to come with"
30-07-2019T22:53:10,Bgrmystr2,"and they charge for the 2nd one, and it's fine cuz I get the sauce I want and they can just order more sauce packets"
30-07-2019T22:53:35,Dadrobit,I'm sure they're not proprietary sauces. The intrepid individual could likely source the exact same sauces/rubs from the same store in the BBQ sauce isle.
30-07-2019T22:53:41,Dadrobit,aisle*
30-07-2019T22:54:29,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, I dunno. Probably not. it's just one of those sauce packets you can get on the side of w/e you buy."
30-07-2019T22:54:51,SpazztasticKiwi,the sauces aren‚Äôt sold in store
30-07-2019T22:55:19,SpazztasticKiwi,the provider sells the boxed chicken with said sauce for hot production
30-07-2019T22:56:46,Bgrmystr2,":thinking: hm, I guess that's understandable. But I can understand someone wanting a sauce that they'd prefer to eat with the boneless chicken."
30-07-2019T22:57:03,SpazztasticKiwi,the mac cheese is stouffers brand but not sure it still seems different from the stuff that‚Äôs available in frozen
30-07-2019T22:57:07,Bgrmystr2,seems silly that your provider wouldn't offer that as an option
30-07-2019T22:57:29,SpazztasticKiwi,we‚Äôre talking walmart here
30-07-2019T22:58:17,SpazztasticKiwi,tyson is the chicken brand we use for damn near all the meat (*cough* chicken)
30-07-2019T22:59:19,SpazztasticKiwi,"the rotisseries, hot case meat, some of the meat, frozen, kids snacks/snacks aisle.."
30-07-2019T22:59:33,SpazztasticKiwi,tyson
30-07-2019T22:59:41,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, for a store as generic as walmart, what kind of sauce could possibly be so good that you can't find elsewhere in the store lol"
30-07-2019T22:59:56,Bgrmystr2,the place ain't known for quality
30-07-2019T23:00:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"if you can get it, it‚Äôs so people are forced to get it at the hot bar"
30-07-2019T23:00:50,SpazztasticKiwi,"tyson is the provider, but they only ship that chicken (&sauce) in bulk"
30-07-2019T23:01:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"to buy bulk, you‚Äôre either rich, have the means to handle it, or are a business"
30-07-2019T23:02:04,SpazztasticKiwi,we do have people ask what hot sauce is the buffalo
30-07-2019T23:02:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"we technically don‚Äôt know cause it comes with the chicken, and since it‚Äôs bulk, again you can‚Äôt just buy a box or buy the sauce"
30-07-2019T23:02:52,Bgrmystr2,The sauce is probably nothing special.
30-07-2019T23:03:32,Bgrmystr2,I'm betting it's somethin generic. Like all the pizza places come with that.. uh.. whatever that sauce is
30-07-2019T23:03:38,Bgrmystr2,it's always the same thing
30-07-2019T23:04:41,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno, I'm no sauce expert, so I dunno wtf they're called, but I know there's a bunch of standard ones and it's prolly just one of those. Something I bet you can find on the shelf elsewhere in the store."
30-07-2019T23:05:44,Bgrmystr2,"Marinera is one of em, kill that with fire tho"
30-07-2019T23:05:44,Dadrobit,My money's on Sweet Baby Ray's as their BBQ sauce
30-07-2019T23:06:03,SpazztasticKiwi,nah I‚Äôve tasted both
30-07-2019T23:06:10,SpazztasticKiwi,the bbq is sweet
30-07-2019T23:06:42,SpazztasticKiwi,honey sweet
30-07-2019T23:07:36,SpazztasticKiwi,bouborn‚Äôs like smoked bbq and I swear if I hear anymore people say they‚Äôre taking it home to get drunk I may throw something
30-07-2019T23:08:11,Dadrobit,"Are you talking about your BBQ rib sauce being sweet, or SBR sauce?"
30-07-2019T23:08:18,Bgrmystr2,"bourbon, kiwi? :o"
30-07-2019T23:08:22,Dadrobit,BBQ Wing sauce*
30-07-2019T23:08:36,Dadrobit,She's probably talking about Jack Daniels BBQ
30-07-2019T23:08:56,Dadrobit,Good stuff imo. Has a good smokey flavor.
30-07-2019T23:09:01,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
30-07-2019T23:09:28,Dadrobit,It's something like Jack Daniels No. 7
30-07-2019T23:10:06,SpazztasticKiwi,all I know is what the box says
30-07-2019T23:10:13,Dadrobit,Yup https://www.amazon.com/Jack-Daniels-Barbecue-Original-Recipe/dp/B00473WSP6/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_325_t_1?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=XR62QKG1SRKPBYASWST1
30-07-2019T23:10:20,SpazztasticKiwi,they say bouborn and bbq
30-07-2019T23:10:23,SpazztasticKiwi,that‚Äôs it
30-07-2019T23:11:00,SpazztasticKiwi,if it is Jack‚Äôs it‚Äôs nasty cause i e tasted that mess
30-07-2019T23:11:15,SpazztasticKiwi,we got new catfish though
30-07-2019T23:11:28,Dadrobit,"If the wing BBQ is super sweet like honey, I'm that much more on the idea of it just being unlabeled Sweet Baby Ray's. That stuff is just high fructose corn syrup, molasses, and sugar."
30-07-2019T23:11:35,SpazztasticKiwi,last stuff was salty ish and dry
30-07-2019T23:11:53,SpazztasticKiwi,this new has some batter flavor
30-07-2019T23:12:00,SpazztasticKiwi,lemon pepper or somethin
30-07-2019T23:12:25,SpazztasticKiwi,it and the salmon seem to get love it or it‚Äôs the worst thing I‚Äôve ever tried
30-07-2019T23:12:36,Bgrmystr2,"After doin a search, I found a crapton of different Bourbon sauces on amazon."
30-07-2019T23:13:07,SpazztasticKiwi,there‚Äôs probably a crapton of molasses in the bouborn
30-07-2019T23:13:15,SpazztasticKiwi,likely why I don‚Äôt like it
30-07-2019T23:13:59,SomeNiceUser,Alcohol! Not really a fan of it though...
30-07-2019T23:14:08,Dadrobit,"Yeah, Bourbon is a great base for sauces because of how it's made. It's basically moonshine that has been left to soak in the flavors of the freshly burnt wood staves it was stored in. So it automatically has a smokey flavor."
30-07-2019T23:14:34,Bgrmystr2,kiwi's speeling of it hurts me a little on the inside every time I see it. xD
30-07-2019T23:14:45,Bgrmystr2,just a little bit
30-07-2019T23:15:35,Bgrmystr2,I should have known it would have been just a flavor kinda thing rather than a company that would be called as such
30-07-2019T23:16:53,SpazztasticKiwi,oh man
30-07-2019T23:17:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Se√°n‚Äôs dads been put in a nursing home
30-07-2019T23:17:38,Dadrobit,"Also, spazz, almost all BBQ sauces have molasses in them. It's a naturally sweet natural thickener."
30-07-2019T23:17:58,SpazztasticKiwi,burbon bouborn booborn buborn
30-07-2019T23:18:02,SpazztasticKiwi,feel the pain
30-07-2019T23:18:29,Dadrobit,bourbon
30-07-2019T23:18:37,Dadrobit,feel the warmth
30-07-2019T23:19:00,Dadrobit,:/ Still need to go to the store to get some more...
30-07-2019T23:19:14,Bgrmystr2,when you do that I don't feel anything cuz I know that's intentional :P
30-07-2019T23:19:35,SpazztasticKiwi,no no
30-07-2019T23:19:40,SpazztasticKiwi,no booze
30-07-2019T23:19:46,SpazztasticKiwi,think healthy
30-07-2019T23:20:00,SpazztasticKiwi,how about wine - it‚Äôs made from fruit
30-07-2019T23:20:10,SpazztasticKiwi,ü•Å
30-07-2019T23:21:37,SpazztasticKiwi,oh y‚Äôall want some tragic news for tonight
30-07-2019T23:22:35,Dadrobit,No
30-07-2019T23:22:48,Dadrobit,Thanks for the offer though!
30-07-2019T23:23:03,SpazztasticKiwi,just checkin
30-07-2019T23:23:44,SpazztasticKiwi,I will say that today they called out every stinkin inspector to test the fire alarms emergency exits and sprinkler system
30-07-2019T23:23:55,SpazztasticKiwi,even the emergency exits
30-07-2019T23:24:41,SpazztasticKiwi,minding your own business till you realize you‚Äôre hearing a distinct siren in the back of the store
30-07-2019T23:24:57,SpazztasticKiwi,they let it wail for about 30 minutes
30-07-2019T23:28:47,SomeNiceUser,That‚Äôs certainly not fun.
30-07-2019T23:29:14,SomeNiceUser,Especially for the ears.
30-07-2019T23:30:02,SpazztasticKiwi,"you‚Äôd think one screech and they could say ‚Äúya it works‚Äù. Apparently not - and when the fire alarm test started, they didn‚Äôt tell us they were testing it - they just let ‚Äòer blare"
30-07-2019T23:30:31,SpazztasticKiwi,course nobody exactly moved anyway
30-07-2019T23:35:01,SomeNiceUser,‚ÄúDeafness for all!‚Äù:ptv-condescending: -Inspectors I guess.
30-07-2019T23:48:58,SpazztasticKiwi,any of you know russel howard
30-07-2019T23:51:04,SpazztasticKiwi,likewise you ever heard something depressingly funny
