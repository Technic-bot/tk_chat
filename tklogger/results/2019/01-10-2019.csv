01-10-2019T00:01:06,SpazztasticKiwi,and no the kid was not dared
01-10-2019T00:01:44,SpazztasticKiwi,he was some young brat something like 5 or 6
01-10-2019T00:03:30,SpazztasticKiwi,"doesn‚Äôt even matter if he was dared - you don‚Äôt touch, let alone hit, other people, nor strangers period"
01-10-2019T00:03:51,SpazztasticKiwi,"above anything, ever, let alone the rear"

01-10-2019T06:20:10,CrRAR,"Yeah, no excuse, hopefully the kid finds better role models doing that at that age makes me think he‚Äôs just imitating behaviors he‚Äôs seen."
01-10-2019T06:22:05,CrRAR,"That sucks about the car, yeah when you jump a car it‚Äôs always red to red, black to black. You just don‚Äôt want to cross them. In fact on the recieving car you can even clamp black to a piece of the frame."
01-10-2019T06:23:02,CrRAR,"Usually you just wait a few minutes, reve the working car and then try."
01-10-2019T06:27:04,CrRAR,"But yeah all those other symptoms sound bad. Oill guage dropped is weird esp if it has oil, maybe an oil pump."
01-10-2019T06:29:11,CrRAR,"If there were no bad sounds, hopefully it didn‚Äôt seize up."

01-10-2019T10:52:30,SpazztasticKiwi,it acted like it‚Äôd crank but didn‚Äôt
01-10-2019T10:53:21,SpazztasticKiwi,gotta look at getting it towed again and fixed and hopefully mother will have the sense to have it fully checked out

01-10-2019T12:36:41,SpazztasticKiwi,what if there was a bathhouse owner that walks in on that and next scene we see her chasing Brutus with a towel yelling pervert

01-10-2019T14:14:27,BadFoMo,That reminds me; I need to un-rage quit and decide which Halloween request to submit.
01-10-2019T15:28:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom in the spoop mood
01-10-2019T15:43:38,SpazztasticKiwi,ü¶á
01-10-2019T16:08:19,SpazztasticKiwi,that makes me think of making bat wings for Bagheera

01-10-2019T16:15:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I am torn on sketch ideas
01-10-2019T16:16:51,SpazztasticKiwi,but between now and then there will be a magic trick
01-10-2019T16:22:45,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm going from 22 to 23 -  I‚Äôm putting Tom‚Äôs age in front of a mirror basically
01-10-2019T16:22:57,SpazztasticKiwi,which is magic in a nutshell I suppose
01-10-2019T16:29:03,SpazztasticKiwi,"if we were to cross Nora with Flora, would we get Florida?"
01-10-2019T16:33:27,SpazztasticKiwi,I got my sketch idea but I want to run my wording by a few people when I go on lunch later
01-10-2019T16:33:37,SpazztasticKiwi,so I‚Äôll be bach
01-10-2019T17:32:56,SpazztasticKiwi,"cat Nora tries to tempt Trace by drawing (poor) stripes on herself and declaring ‚ÄúTrace, it is I, your darling wife Flora‚Äù Trace not only flatly points out the obvious, that Flora is orange, but she is also not as....glaringly top heavy"
01-10-2019T17:34:45,TerraTheWizard,https://www.patreon.com/posts/flora-trust-me-20084279
01-10-2019T17:37:01,SpazztasticKiwi,you know that doesn‚Äôt open up in app
01-10-2019T17:37:14,SpazztasticKiwi,and gets blocked in browser
01-10-2019T17:37:23,SpazztasticKiwi,also this is meant as a halloween party gag
01-10-2019T17:37:44,TerraTheWizard,https://www.deviantart.com/twokinds/art/Flora-Trust-Me-754641524
01-10-2019T17:37:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve yet to see Nora be able to mimic anything further than skin
01-10-2019T17:38:06,TerraTheWizard,forgot that was a patron locked one
01-10-2019T17:38:10,SpazztasticKiwi,her height and....blessed status stays the same
01-10-2019T17:39:12,SpazztasticKiwi,may bring up the question if Flora and Nora are different heights as I would guess is the case
01-10-2019T17:40:21,SpazztasticKiwi,another question - based on the fact she can in fact transform but her original and base form is a dragon
01-10-2019T17:40:44,SpazztasticKiwi,"does she have paws, feet, or claws"
01-10-2019T17:40:52,SpazztasticKiwi,or hands
01-10-2019T17:43:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I got a different one I‚Äôll try first
01-10-2019T17:44:29,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
01-10-2019T17:51:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I wonder if it would be too much to have an actual valentines day card made with that ‚Äúyou make my heart go weh‚Äù thing I came up with
01-10-2019T18:42:38,Dadrobit,"Hmmmm, should maybe put Sythe Diplomacy Lessons on hiatus and come up with a Halloween centric version. I think I tend to have decent success there?"
01-10-2019T19:01:26,Dadrobit,Would a Rocky Horror Picture Show reference go over most peoples' heads?
01-10-2019T19:25:26,CrRAR,Tim Curry is a win in my book.
01-10-2019T19:44:22,Dadrobit,Here's the thing...
01-10-2019T19:44:24,Dadrobit,Trace and Flora as Brad and Janet being greeted at the mansion by Euchre and Rose as Riff Raff and Magenta (optional Maddie as Columbia in the backgound) is a hella #QualitySuggestion!
01-10-2019T19:44:52,Dadrobit,But I fear that there are too many youngins in the voting bloc that have never even DONE the Time Warp...
01-10-2019T20:11:36,CrRAR,lol yeah
01-10-2019T21:27:48,SpazztasticKiwi,for the sake of knowing the time warp yes
01-10-2019T21:27:54,SpazztasticKiwi,any other reason nope
01-10-2019T21:28:10,SpazztasticKiwi,my hs has a school music video
01-10-2019T21:28:15,SpazztasticKiwi,we did the time warp
01-10-2019T21:31:37,SpazztasticKiwi,man this little kid got to the counter today with his mom
01-10-2019T21:31:58,SpazztasticKiwi,she was getting him a popcorn chicken cup and he was pumped‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
01-10-2019T21:33:25,SpazztasticKiwi,an almost ritual/summoning chant of ‚Äúchickenchickenchickenchicken‚Äù
01-10-2019T21:38:11,AspiringNoodle,"that sounds like me getting to the gas station, lol"
01-10-2019T21:38:17,AspiringNoodle,"""slushyslushyslushyslushyslushy"""
01-10-2019T21:47:22,SpazztasticKiwi,I found out today that it was considered Kellan Lutz play Edward Cullen instead of Rob Patterson
