22-09-2019T21:47:39,MoonDance,I don't think $30 is bad- especially to a game that updates a lot of stuff
22-09-2019T21:48:00,AnuSekaniArt,Yeah it's not a bad price for a game like Minecraft
22-09-2019T21:49:05,MoonDance,Plus there is just so much you can. Minecraft has never really let down on gaming opportunities

22-09-2019T21:53:42,Dadrobit,Bang doesn't have any sugar in it
22-09-2019T21:54:25,MoonDance,I know they have some real sketchy ingredients in it
