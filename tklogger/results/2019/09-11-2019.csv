09-11-2019T16:29:46,tehbear,depents on humidity
09-11-2019T16:29:46,ThingsAreMoving,I love crisp fresh air
09-11-2019T16:29:58,Zakuru,"like, if its below 0 C there has to be snow, otherwise im going on strike"

09-11-2019T16:30:46,ThingsAreMoving,just gotta endure it
09-11-2019T16:30:48,Ordithus,I just wish people were willing to enjoy it rather than work on days with 12+ inches
09-11-2019T16:30:49,Zakuru,just like when i see dudes wearing jackets but they be wearing shorts
09-11-2019T16:31:15,MarvTheHugPharaoh,they must not have nerves in their legs
09-11-2019T16:31:19,ThingsAreMoving,Short + sleeveless hoodie
09-11-2019T16:31:22,tehbear,"warm air rises, so if you can capture it in the jacket, wearing shorts might not be too bad"

09-11-2019T18:53:20,HoverdudeXL,Yea
09-11-2019T18:53:23,PalmettoPathfinder1,That should be a good suggestion: Trace accidentally casts a spell that removes everyone's mouths and they have a look of where they're screaming and yet they can't scream.  :D
09-11-2019T18:53:23,tehbear,Flora caught her tail in the door
09-11-2019T18:53:24,Kitdragandbloodymiku19,that could be it

09-11-2019T18:54:46,PalmettoPathfinder1,Or Trace stepped on her tail.  Or Eric grabbed her tail/butt/both.
