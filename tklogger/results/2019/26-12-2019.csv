26-12-2019T22:07:35,KuroganeWatanoshi,Just curious. What day of the week does new pages usually come? Or does the comic update whenever Tom can?
26-12-2019T22:07:54,ZRO4825,Pretty much whenever Tom chooses to grace us with a page~
26-12-2019T22:07:58,KeefMcDerpface,Saturdays unless other wise stated.

26-12-2019T22:16:40,ZRO4825,Flora ammo wouldn't fly very well. Too flat.
26-12-2019T22:16:48,NezumiYuki,pfffffffffffffff

26-12-2019T22:18:47,ZRO4825,"It's not harsh. It's the truth! In order for ammo to properly pierce air, it must first exist. Reni did not include ammo racks, therefore, no ammo to use. Flora is too flat fronted, so she'd have too much air resistance. :P"
26-12-2019T22:19:12,NezumiYuki,Okay then how about black magic enhanced Natani busting out of her bandages THICC for bazooka ammo?
26-12-2019T22:19:30,SageSaga,this is why you couldnt be a physicist Zro

26-12-2019T22:21:31,IronHorseComics,I approve of Zro being the boobologist
26-12-2019T22:21:54,SageSaga,then you should know that boobs create drag not improve aerodynamics
