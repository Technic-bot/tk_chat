30-05-2019T01:34:56,AspiringNoodle,I either have a gaming addiction or a SERIOUS lack of control.
30-05-2019T01:36:26,AspiringNoodle,"Can confirm, just spent the last 12 hours playing apex legends."

30-05-2019T02:15:48,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve found letting some video play as I type can kill hours
30-05-2019T02:16:33,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s been interesting getting put some of the scenes that run through my head even if they don’t make a lick of sense
30-05-2019T02:25:22,AspiringNoodle,"Well, here's hoping in the future I can get myself under control in the future..."
30-05-2019T02:25:44,AspiringNoodle,"*slaps face*  Okay, I've been up too long."
30-05-2019T02:26:39,AspiringNoodle,But seriously.  I don't care how long it's been since I've played some games.  That's ridiculous.  I need to control myself >_>

30-05-2019T02:34:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Watching a comp on the smack around throughout the marvel movies you have to wonder what’s keeping their bones together
30-05-2019T02:35:10,AspiringNoodle,"Well, to be fair, people did the science on Captain America's shield ;)"
30-05-2019T02:35:26,AspiringNoodle,"Let's just say that every baddie he's ""knocked out"" with it is dead.  Very dead."
30-05-2019T02:36:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Freeze frames of when he ducks behind it is one of my favorite things

30-05-2019T12:48:36,AspiringNoodle,Fallout definition 2: the adverse side effects or results of a situation.
30-05-2019T12:49:05,AspiringNoodle,"Also maybe legitimate fallout, because her power levels, they're too high!"
30-05-2019T12:52:45,AspiringNoodle,"Hmmm... if her love zap created a mushroom cloud, would it look like a mushroom, or would there be a giant heart at the top?"
30-05-2019T14:47:55,TeapotOfDoom,But it would not be terrifying enough with a heart on top now would it?

30-05-2019T21:16:53,AFallingTree,the community around that show makes me feel dead inside
30-05-2019T21:16:58,swedishkitsune,^
30-05-2019T21:17:04,SageSaga,good thing a community doesnt define something
30-05-2019T21:17:10,SomethingSelfless,okie dokie pipe and smokey
30-05-2019T21:17:17,swedishkitsune,especially when the debacle with the sauce thing happened
30-05-2019T21:17:53,SageSaga,those are people - not a product of a show
30-05-2019T21:18:00,Masterzooka,*bashes head on table because the stream stops every five seconds for like a minute each time*
30-05-2019T21:18:24,Ordithus,"Speaking of stream issues, Sage, what was the fix?"
30-05-2019T21:18:36,SageSaga,there was no fix
30-05-2019T21:18:44,SomethingSelfless,buy an autoclicker to refresh the page when it stops
30-05-2019T21:18:47,AFallingTree,"i dunno, even without the people i just didnt find it entertaining. personal preference i think"

30-05-2019T21:19:19,SageSaga,the local internet sucks- the node was dying- they made some repairs and i made complaints- and there are still issues
30-05-2019T21:19:22,SageSaga,but its better than it was
30-05-2019T21:19:28,SomethingSelfless,i ain't gonna be able to sleep with all my hype.
