17-11-2019T00:35:51,JojoF2415,Still don‚Äôt know what your talking about

17-11-2019T00:39:44,JojoF2415,I‚Äôve been playing Pok√©mon sword
17-11-2019T00:40:07,JojoF2415,I‚Äôm taking way too long beating the game
17-11-2019T00:40:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve been going through Sean‚Äôs DS series
17-11-2019T00:40:52,Dadrobit,Sean?

17-11-2019T00:41:12,Dadrobit,Not familiar with him
17-11-2019T00:41:44,Dadrobit,He enjoying it?
17-11-2019T00:43:18,Dadrobit,It feels like it'd be a hard game to get a lot out of for content without a particularly charismatic host. Too much backtracking.
17-11-2019T00:44:02,SpazztasticKiwi,yep
17-11-2019T00:44:38,SpazztasticKiwi,"he‚Äôs a youtuber, does stuff  with Mark occasionally"

17-11-2019T00:46:01,SpazztasticKiwi,so far I like the game too but I can‚Äôt be the only one that feels they throw an awful lot at you
17-11-2019T00:46:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"not only in the beginning but as you go on, term wise and literally with all the packages stuff"
17-11-2019T00:46:57,Dadrobit,The first dozen or so hours is very very cinematic heavy for sure.
17-11-2019T00:47:19,JojoF2415,I am addicted to geometry dash
17-11-2019T00:47:38,AspiringNoodle,Inb4 youtube stars are a thing of the past :P
17-11-2019T00:47:52,AspiringNoodle,Youtube only wants actual celebrities / networks on their website in the future >_>
17-11-2019T00:48:51,JojoF2415,You tube is annoying with the Tik tok ads
17-11-2019T00:49:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I may be ‚Äúfurther in‚Äù so to speak with the game since he got a pre release and has all the way to the first 22+ hours out already
17-11-2019T00:50:06,SpazztasticKiwi,2 hour episodes
17-11-2019T00:50:11,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm only on 4

17-11-2019T00:52:13,Ordithus,"Also I just realized you were talking about Death Stranding not Dark Souls, kiwi :ptv-laugh:"
17-11-2019T00:52:14,Dadrobit,"Took a glance at the channel, he's way way further than I am in the story, so I'm not gonna be watching much of that alas."
17-11-2019T00:53:05,Dadrobit,"Is he going through and maxing out the affinity of everyone he's delivering to, or is he just ""sprinting"" through the story?"
17-11-2019T00:53:18,SpazztasticKiwi,he‚Äôs taking his time it seems
17-11-2019T00:53:23,SpazztasticKiwi,but he‚Äôs not for everyone
17-11-2019T00:53:44,Dadrobit,This game isn't for everyone lol.
17-11-2019T00:53:52,Dadrobit,Just happens to tick all my boxes personally.
17-11-2019T00:54:03,SpazztasticKiwi,that video of a guy screaming I linked her awhile back was him
17-11-2019T00:54:19,SpazztasticKiwi,April fools thing from last year or so
17-11-2019T00:54:28,Ordithus,Well if I find myself bored I'll give his series a watch.  I like some of his stuff
17-11-2019T00:55:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"he‚Äôs also done the Until Dawn and it‚Äôs ‚Äúsuceessor‚Äù, if you‚Äôd call it that"
17-11-2019T00:55:21,SpazztasticKiwi,his and Marks Until Dawn are good

17-11-2019T01:01:53,SpazztasticKiwi,gnat was crawling over my nose and I brushed at it and brushed at it
17-11-2019T01:02:28,SpazztasticKiwi,spider fell
17-11-2019T01:07:20,Dadrobit,"Sorry, was off getting a drink. But that sounds rather traumatic!"
17-11-2019T01:09:09,SpazztasticKiwi,it was after seeing Mark‚Äôs ‚ÄúI found a spider in my vr headset‚Äù video
17-11-2019T01:09:15,SpazztasticKiwi,I blame him
17-11-2019T01:11:02,DarthRexKing,"Insects and bugs everywhere, no point in crying about it."
17-11-2019T01:11:07,DarthRexKing,and arachnids.
17-11-2019T01:13:29,SpazztasticKiwi,who said I was
17-11-2019T01:30:21,DarthRexKing,A guess after you said you were traumatized by a virtual reality spider. :V
17-11-2019T01:49:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I never said I was
17-11-2019T01:50:08,SpazztasticKiwi,"if you read it right, I had an actual spider fall off my face"
17-11-2019T01:50:48,SpazztasticKiwi,after seeing Mark‚Äôs vr video where he mentions vacuuming a spider out of his headset before recording
17-11-2019T01:51:04,SpazztasticKiwi,"if you can‚Äôt tell, it was a joke"
17-11-2019T01:51:16,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt actually blame Mark
17-11-2019T01:52:55,DarthRexKing,"I did. I thought your fear of the spider was made worse by the VR video. Hard for me to tell a statement from a joke, but my humor was never good. Anyway it is late. Goodnight all. :)"

17-11-2019T14:48:25,AspiringNoodle,Thought $6.50 might be a bit much compared to Taco Bell.  But fuggin' heck this thing is a brick

17-11-2019T15:33:26,AspiringNoodle,I just wish they'd bring back the versions with other sauces inside >_>
17-11-2019T15:44:53,AspiringNoodle,has become RoundNoodle

17-11-2019T15:55:43,AspiringNoodle,"Go to a local restaurant, and you're likely to get authentic versions of the food"
17-11-2019T16:52:48,Dadrobit,The food is 85% of the reason I still live in AZ.
17-11-2019T16:52:57,Dadrobit,Complete spectrum of Mexican food.
17-11-2019T16:54:20,Dadrobit,"Taco Bell for the Taco Bell experience, AmeriMex chains abound, and Authentic Mexican on every third corner, or south Phoenix for the complete ""Did I accidentally cross the border?"" package."
