04-11-2019T15:04:55,TeapotOfDoom,what the hell dad? did you find this thing in your house?
04-11-2019T15:10:51,Dadrobit,Yeah in my guard house last night. Just swept the guy out the door so he can hunt all the local cockroaches... And small animals probably.
04-11-2019T15:14:56,Orthonox,That is so cool you have tarantulas near your area.
04-11-2019T15:19:23,TeapotOfDoom,i mean i'm not the one to be terrified by spiders but seing this thing live would probably make me second guess that fact
04-11-2019T15:20:08,TeapotOfDoom,so these things are natural to your area?
04-11-2019T15:23:53,Dadrobit,It was some varaint of a Red Knee tarantula which are native to Mexico and the Souther US.
04-11-2019T15:25:54,TeapotOfDoom,and this thing's mostly peaceful i hope?
04-11-2019T15:25:54,Dadrobit,"Least, that's what my brother is telling me, he's got a bunch of pet spiders and tarantulas."
04-11-2019T15:26:18,Dadrobit,"If it is what he says it is, it's an extremely docile spider."
04-11-2019T15:29:09,Dadrobit,"Though, doing my own research for a minute or two, it looks closer to a Desert Tarantual"
04-11-2019T15:29:18,Dadrobit,Tarantula*
04-11-2019T15:30:07,Dadrobit,"Still, seems like the verdict is that they're docile if not outright handleable."

04-11-2019T21:53:02,Orthonox,Not great? Oh no! Why?
04-11-2019T21:57:22,Twokinds,I'm just having a little difficulty making progress.
04-11-2019T22:02:12,SpazztasticKiwi,on comics? side stuff? the unending barrel roll down the hill of life?
04-11-2019T22:02:50,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre gonna eat you alive for it

04-11-2019T22:03:14,JojoF2415,I just found out a while ago that Nintendo is deleting all Pok√©mon sword and shield leaks
04-11-2019T22:06:42,Dadrobit,"Ah, heard about a leak earlier today. Evidently the cut Pokemon totals over half of all Pokemon."
04-11-2019T22:07:15,Dadrobit,So that the total number left in the game even including the NEW ones totals less than even the XY games.
04-11-2019T22:07:20,JojoF2415,Pok√©mon YouTubers deleted all their leak videos
04-11-2019T22:07:36,JojoF2415,I‚Äôm getting sword

04-11-2019T22:08:55,JojoF2415,The ones in the gameboy
04-11-2019T22:09:44,Dadrobit,This'll be the first Gen that I'm not getting. Very sad for me.

04-11-2019T22:11:44,SpazztasticKiwi,so is it dialogue or a pages looks you‚Äôre on?
04-11-2019T22:12:00,Dadrobit,"Alas, it is time for work."
