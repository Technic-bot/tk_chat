06-02-2019T16:58:16,SpazztasticKiwi,& hows it been goin for you
06-02-2019T17:05:13,CrimsonQuill,Gooood evening....:ptv-sad:
06-02-2019T17:06:49,Azumachan,:ctwokinds-traceflohug:
06-02-2019T17:06:55,CrimsonQuill,Hi.
06-02-2019T17:07:04,CrimsonQuill,How is everyone?
06-02-2019T17:07:06,Azumachan,Howdy
06-02-2019T17:12:02,Xexanoth,tired
06-02-2019T17:12:10,CrimsonQuill,Me too.
06-02-2019T17:12:23,CrimsonQuill,Finished at 9:00pm.
06-02-2019T17:12:32,CrimsonQuill,"Had burnt toast and beans for dinner,"
06-02-2019T17:15:48,Xexanoth,....how'd you manage burn toast?
06-02-2019T17:16:03,CrimsonQuill,Trying to fry it in a non-stick pan.
06-02-2019T17:16:15,CrimsonQuill,"My brain's fudged,"
06-02-2019T17:16:28,Bgrmystr2,it's fairly easy to burn toast? just leave it in the toaster for longer than usual
06-02-2019T17:16:34,Bgrmystr2,it'll get real burnt real quick.
06-02-2019T17:16:52,CrimsonQuill,A fact of life.
06-02-2019T17:17:05,Xexanoth,...aren't toasters on timers?
06-02-2019T17:17:13,Xexanoth,at least i haven't seen one that wasn't
06-02-2019T17:17:22,Bgrmystr2,not all
06-02-2019T17:17:28,Xexanoth,TIL
06-02-2019T17:17:29,Bgrmystr2,some yeah
06-02-2019T17:17:31,Bgrmystr2,ours is not
06-02-2019T17:17:35,Bgrmystr2,we have a toaster oven
06-02-2019T17:17:44,Bgrmystr2,and you have to manually set a timer
06-02-2019T17:17:51,Bgrmystr2,"there is no ""toast"" timer on it, not a thing."
06-02-2019T17:18:23,Bgrmystr2,"and most toasters that I've seen don't toast your toast to the proper color anyway, it's just crispy bread, it's not actual toast"
06-02-2019T17:18:29,Bgrmystr2,so they're mistimed from the get-go
06-02-2019T17:18:41,Bgrmystr2,so doing it another round you have to stop it mid-way or it burns em
06-02-2019T17:18:54,Bgrmystr2,so standard toasters are equally useless.
06-02-2019T17:19:28,CrimsonQuill,How's Tom's dog?
06-02-2019T17:19:48,CrimsonQuill,I saw on the chat last night but couldn't put anything in (as it was late).
06-02-2019T17:19:50,Bgrmystr2,haven't seen a word about it
06-02-2019T17:20:06,Xexanoth,all toaster's i've seen either had multiple timings to select or a ...uhm timer that works like a volume control kinda thing?(no idea what the english word is)
06-02-2019T17:20:26,Bgrmystr2,"then you must have very different toasters, cuz we only get one timer here."
06-02-2019T17:20:31,Bgrmystr2,you push the thing down
06-02-2019T17:20:33,Bgrmystr2,and it toasts
06-02-2019T17:20:34,Bgrmystr2,and that's it.
06-02-2019T17:20:38,Bgrmystr2,and it pops up when it's done
06-02-2019T17:20:50,CrimsonQuill,I tried to fry it in a non-stick pan.
06-02-2019T17:20:56,CrimsonQuill,It didn't turn out too well.
06-02-2019T17:21:08,CrimsonQuill,And to top that off I put in far too much salt.
06-02-2019T17:22:15,Xexanoth,...
06-02-2019T17:26:15,Mippy,"Our toaster has 6 different timers, a bagel button, and a heat and defrost option"
06-02-2019T17:26:26,Mippy,Also hello
06-02-2019T17:27:04,CrimsonQuill,"Evening, Mippy."
06-02-2019T17:27:15,Mippy,Afternoon Quill
06-02-2019T17:27:44,Bgrmystr2,I want that lol
06-02-2019T17:27:57,Xexanoth,it's like a standard 30buck toaster over here
06-02-2019T17:28:13,Bgrmystr2,"Wish that was a thing here, cuz I've never seen one."
06-02-2019T17:28:20,Mippy,XD it can also do four pieces of bread at once
06-02-2019T17:28:27,CrimsonQuill,I'm just going to read some Calvin and Hobbes and crawl into bed with my teddy bear...
06-02-2019T17:28:39,CrimsonQuill,Because I am drained after today.
06-02-2019T17:28:49,CrimsonQuill,Photogrammetry is very technical.
06-02-2019T17:29:04,Mippy,"Eh, I got to go to work."
06-02-2019T17:29:19,CrimsonQuill,"Well, I might as well say goodnight."
06-02-2019T17:29:24,CrimsonQuill,"Sleep well, everyone."
06-02-2019T17:29:29,Xexanoth,goodnight quill
06-02-2019T17:29:34,CrimsonQuill,:ptv-scratch::ptv-greetings::ptv-sleepy:
06-02-2019T17:29:56,Mippy,Good night. I’ll sleep in...eight hours...or so
06-02-2019T17:30:01,Xexanoth,this is just a normal toaster over here Bgr: https://picscdn.redblue.de/doi/pixelboxx-mss-74369791/fee_786_587_png/UNOLD-38020-Design-Dual--Toaster--1350-Watt
06-02-2019T17:30:09,Xexanoth,it's like 25 Euros
06-02-2019T17:30:18,Bgrmystr2,what the literal fuck lol
06-02-2019T17:30:20,Xexanoth,not even the expensive stuff XD
06-02-2019T17:30:31,Mippy,Not the model we have
06-02-2019T17:31:05,Xexanoth,i literally just put toaster in google and picked one of the first results mippy XD
06-02-2019T17:31:14,Azumachan,Xexanoth The red toaster
06-02-2019T17:31:34,Bgrmystr2,"yeah we have nothing like that, I've never seen any kind of toaster with any knobs or anyshit like that"
06-02-2019T17:31:46,Bgrmystr2,maybe it's just where I live
06-02-2019T17:31:58,Bgrmystr2,"cuz back before I moved here, it was like 2002"
06-02-2019T17:32:09,Bgrmystr2,and toasters didn't really have knobs or doodads or whatever
06-02-2019T17:32:38,Bgrmystr2,"and since moving here, I still only see like super boring classic toasters, literally nothing of note."
06-02-2019T17:32:40,Mippy,http://imgur.com/GsC3RaV http://imgur.com/W0tdna1 Ours
06-02-2019T17:35:10,Xexanoth,that red toaster is fancy azumachan
06-02-2019T17:35:51,Bgrmystr2,We have a toaster oven like this cuz normal toasters don't have any controls https://www.target.com/p/black-decker-4-slice-toaster-oven-stainless-steel-to1700sg/-/A-50939812
06-02-2019T17:35:59,Bgrmystr2,"it's not that one, but it's basically the same"
06-02-2019T17:36:22,Bgrmystr2,"all the toaster ovens are fairly similar, they don't really change much for what they stock here."
06-02-2019T17:36:47,Xexanoth,"link doesn't work for me, autoredirects me to some internation starting page :/"
06-02-2019T17:37:10,Bgrmystr2,okay here https://target.scene7.com/is/image/Target/GUEST_58d469b5-28f3-458d-b21c-b26bfb51bc74?wid=1400&fmt=pjpeg
06-02-2019T17:37:20,Bgrmystr2,target has some stupid long links lol
06-02-2019T17:38:40,Mippy,One of those...I thought those were for melting cheese or heating nugget so
06-02-2019T17:38:53,Bgrmystr2,they're the same as any other toaster
06-02-2019T17:38:56,Bgrmystr2,but they have controls
06-02-2019T17:39:12,Bgrmystr2,they are what an ordinary toaster should have been. But toasters never died I guess.
06-02-2019T17:39:28,Mippy,I’ve never seen anyone use one for toast :ctwokinds-floraquestion:
06-02-2019T17:39:29,Xexanoth,hmm kinda looks like a grill XD
06-02-2019T17:39:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Mippy did you see Mark’s monopoly video yet
06-02-2019T17:39:42,Bgrmystr2,you've probably never come to the US Mippy
06-02-2019T17:39:50,Mippy,"No, Kiwi"
06-02-2019T17:40:03,Mippy,Can’t say I have Bgr
06-02-2019T17:40:18,Bgrmystr2,cuz I don't know anyone who uses a toaster anymore besides like... super old toasters that still work after 40 years of purchasing it
06-02-2019T17:40:26,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s interesting. And a good hint not to play monopoly with Wade
06-02-2019T17:41:30,Bgrmystr2,"Honestly, the amount of super old toasters I see is a testament to how good they were made and how long they last, but I don't see anyone purchasing a new one, and anyone who does just buys a toaster oven cuz it can do so much more."
06-02-2019T17:41:33,Mippy,But it’s so easy and convenient :ctwokinds-sadtrace2:
06-02-2019T17:42:00,Xexanoth,toaster are very simple so they tend to last a long time
06-02-2019T17:42:04,Bgrmystr2,"it does only one thing, and the toaster oven can do that thing just as well plus more."
06-02-2019T17:42:25,Mippy,"Yeah, but so can a normal oven."
06-02-2019T17:42:50,Bgrmystr2,"of course, but you're not gonna use an oven to cook your toast are you? xD"
06-02-2019T17:43:13,Bgrmystr2,you need to toast like 30 slices at once?
06-02-2019T17:43:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Only here do we have a toaster discussion
06-02-2019T17:43:23,Mippy,"No,I’m gonna use the toaster."
06-02-2019T17:43:55,Mippy,"If I needed to do 30 slices at once, which I never do. I’d use the oven"
06-02-2019T17:44:26,Bgrmystr2,"of course ya do, but that's illogical as the oven has an entirely different purpose. You don't use the oven for small things. That's a lot of electricity, or gas, for something that won't actually cook properly due to the sheer size of the oven."
06-02-2019T17:44:46,Xexanoth,"""not gonna use an oven for toast"".........you guys never made toast hawai?"
06-02-2019T17:45:04,Bgrmystr2,"you're trying to toast a whole state, xex?"
06-02-2019T17:45:17,Bgrmystr2,I'm sure the volcanos on the islands do that job well enough..
06-02-2019T17:45:33,Xexanoth,"it's toast with ham, cheese and pineapple on top. put in oven till nice and melty"
06-02-2019T17:45:47,Xexanoth,and you're gonna need a lot of it cause it's delicious
06-02-2019T17:45:51,Mippy,"Well, if I have multiple trays of toast it’s not actually a small thing."
06-02-2019T17:46:07,Bgrmystr2,a toaster fits one slice of toast in each tray
06-02-2019T17:46:09,Bgrmystr2,and is sideways
06-02-2019T17:46:17,Bgrmystr2,you literally cannot make a grilled cheese in a toaster
06-02-2019T17:46:19,Mippy,Oh! I call that “Poor Man Pizza” and I have made it
06-02-2019T17:46:28,Bgrmystr2,the cheese melts into the thing.
06-02-2019T17:46:30,Xexanoth,that's why i was talking about ovens
06-02-2019T17:46:44,Mippy,That’s why you have a range
06-02-2019T17:47:18,Bgrmystr2,I just use the toaster oven cuz it can do that without having to preheat the oven for a half hour before making food.
06-02-2019T17:47:19,Bgrmystr2,:v
06-02-2019T17:47:41,Xexanoth,"well, your mistake is actually preheating the oven"
06-02-2019T17:47:43,Mippy,You don’t preheat a range....
06-02-2019T17:47:56,Xexanoth,which for most stuff is completely useless and a waste of electricity
06-02-2019T17:47:56,Bgrmystr2,"then you're ovening wrong, xex xD"
06-02-2019T17:48:11,Xexanoth,clearly XD
06-02-2019T17:48:49,Mippy,My understanding is that the oven is the thing you cook things IN and the range is the thing you cook things ON
06-02-2019T17:49:09,Bgrmystr2,"this is why you don't use the oven unless you're making something in it. toaster oven works fine, lets you make grilled cheese, or any kind of toasted sandwich."
06-02-2019T17:49:24,Bgrmystr2,I know a range as something that cattle roam on. :P
06-02-2019T17:49:33,Bgrmystr2,so that term is lost on me lol
06-02-2019T17:49:48,Xexanoth,range is word for distance :ptv-confused:
06-02-2019T17:49:55,Bgrmystr2,yes I know that
06-02-2019T17:50:15,Xexanoth,this was more my confusion since it apparently also means other stuff
06-02-2019T17:50:18,Mippy,Range is like a stove....the top part of the oven with the burners on it
06-02-2019T17:50:23,Xexanoth,i see
06-02-2019T17:50:34,Bgrmystr2,lol you guys have some weird naming schemes
06-02-2019T17:50:42,Bgrmystr2,I dunno anyone who'd call it that.
06-02-2019T17:51:03,Mippy,Go eat a Chesterfield Bgr

06-02-2019T17:54:21,TerraTheWizard,that clovis face
06-02-2019T17:55:07,Bgrmystr2,"who the fuck would buy a $1600 couch, nevermind eat it XD"
06-02-2019T17:55:21,Bgrmystr2,that's complete horseshit hahaha
06-02-2019T17:55:32,Mippy,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
06-02-2019T17:56:07,Bgrmystr2,"I wouldn't touch a couch unless there was a big couch, small couch, recliner chair, and center connector as one purchase for more than $1200"
06-02-2019T17:56:12,Bgrmystr2,and I've seen it
06-02-2019T17:56:16,Bgrmystr2,and they're soft as fuck
06-02-2019T17:56:26,Bgrmystr2,so $1600 for one couch can die.
06-02-2019T17:56:44,Xexanoth,"pretty ""normal"" price for brand couches"
06-02-2019T17:57:00,Bgrmystr2,that's not normal at all. That shouldn't be more than $800 at most.
06-02-2019T17:57:03,Bgrmystr2,if that.
06-02-2019T17:57:04,Xexanoth,not sure what kind of people buy em but apparently they sell
06-02-2019T17:57:47,Xexanoth,"i mean, it's just the same as expensiv ebrand tshirts and stuff"
06-02-2019T17:57:59,Xexanoth,"shouldn't sell for that much, but people still buy it for the price"
06-02-2019T18:04:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Where the hell you live that couches are $800
06-02-2019T18:05:08,SpazztasticKiwi,We got new basic ones for like $300
06-02-2019T18:05:45,Xexanoth,how the fuck do you get couches that cheap?
06-02-2019T18:06:12,SpazztasticKiwi,This just in - Alabama cheap af
06-02-2019T18:06:56,Bgrmystr2,actually couches being 200-400 is fairly standard
06-02-2019T18:07:04,Xexanoth,not over here in germany
06-02-2019T18:07:07,Bgrmystr2,$800 is solid for a GOOD quality couch
06-02-2019T18:07:22,Bgrmystr2,and even that's still asking for the maximum
06-02-2019T18:07:50,Bgrmystr2,"they should not, nor should they ever be more than $1500 for a single piece of furnature"
06-02-2019T18:08:26,Bgrmystr2,"that couch better have the softest material in the world, recline the entire length, and have hidden cupholders and coffee makers."
06-02-2019T18:08:36,Bgrmystr2,cuz it's not worth shit close to the price otherwise xD
06-02-2019T18:08:45,Xexanoth,"nah, it has an expensive name on it so it's 2 grand"
06-02-2019T18:09:12,Bgrmystr2,there's nothing special about the name other than it being overpriced
06-02-2019T18:09:20,Bgrmystr2,it doesn't guarantee quality
06-02-2019T18:09:26,Bgrmystr2,never will lol
06-02-2019T18:10:08,Bgrmystr2,I wouldn't touch that. That's to the point of lining someone's pockets lol
06-02-2019T18:10:26,Xexanoth,that's the whole point of designer stuff
06-02-2019T18:10:44,Bgrmystr2,and that's why only people with more money than brains buy the stuff
06-02-2019T18:10:50,Xexanoth,yup
06-02-2019T18:10:51,Bgrmystr2,noone else does.
06-02-2019T18:11:11,Bgrmystr2,it's not any better than anything else
06-02-2019T18:11:17,Bgrmystr2,it's just more expensive
06-02-2019T18:11:41,Bgrmystr2,you paid more for it.. and somehow it gives you the ability to gloat..? okay
06-02-2019T18:11:51,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t understand people that get the leather or suede/easily scratched stuff
06-02-2019T18:12:19,Bgrmystr2,"leather is dumb anyway, it's rubbery and gets hot real quick"
06-02-2019T18:12:25,Bgrmystr2,will give you rub burns if you sit on it too long
06-02-2019T18:12:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Not to mention velcro thighs
06-02-2019T18:12:51,Xexanoth,"we have leather couches, they're nice"
06-02-2019T18:13:03,Xexanoth,and feel cool in the summer which is great
06-02-2019T18:13:14,Bgrmystr2,they absorb heat
06-02-2019T18:13:19,Bgrmystr2,so quickly
06-02-2019T18:13:29,Bgrmystr2,so I guess if you live in an igloo at the north pole
06-02-2019T18:13:31,Bgrmystr2,then maybe
06-02-2019T18:13:32,Bgrmystr2,xD
06-02-2019T18:13:55,Bgrmystr2,"but here on the gulf coast, they'll just melt you into a puddle."
06-02-2019T18:14:50,Xexanoth,yeah i guess coast weather is usually pretty humid? that would suck for leather
06-02-2019T18:14:58,SpazztasticKiwi,If I could just find a couch in the future that didn’t collect hair like a lint roller I’ll be good
06-02-2019T18:15:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Two cats means alot of hair
06-02-2019T18:15:14,Bgrmystr2,the humidity is like 70 or 80%+ all year round lolol
06-02-2019T18:15:27,Bgrmystr2,peaking 100% during summer
06-02-2019T18:15:32,Bgrmystr2,and during wet months
06-02-2019T18:15:37,Xexanoth,that's just the pet life kiwi
06-02-2019T18:16:06,Xexanoth,unless you invent some futurist auto hair removing couch there's not much you can do
06-02-2019T18:16:40,Bgrmystr2,"honestly, just give me a nice soft couch that's $600, nothing too expensive, nothing too extravagant."
06-02-2019T18:16:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera sheds like its going out of style but Kiwi has to be trimmed cause she’s mega poof
06-02-2019T18:17:11,Xexanoth,"and to go on a tangent, the fact that furry comics never depict hair anywhere is kinda unrealistic...."
06-02-2019T18:17:23,Xexanoth,it should be everywhere....
06-02-2019T18:17:32,Bgrmystr2,probably because they don't shed like animals do here.
06-02-2019T18:35:59,Dadrobit,"If they have regular showers/baths every day, they likely don't worry about it too much as most of it would be teken out there."

06-02-2019T18:45:51,SpazztasticKiwi,The pets? Yeah baths help but it’s colder than my relationship status
06-02-2019T18:46:09,SpazztasticKiwi,They don’t need to get sick
06-02-2019T18:47:33,Ordithus,"All you can do about the cat hair is clean often.  A good diet and regular brushing can help, but in the end there will be fluff everywhere."
06-02-2019T18:47:47,Ordithus,I grew up with a longhair cat and another that was just a shedding machine.
06-02-2019T18:47:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m ok with fluff really
06-02-2019T18:48:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I shed more than they do anyway
06-02-2019T18:48:13,Xexanoth,:ptv-shock:
06-02-2019T18:48:30,Ordithus,That guy had the right idea.  Just drove a snowmobile past my house
06-02-2019T18:49:58,SpazztasticKiwi,I mean I don’t remember putting up a picture of Kiwi but she F L U F F Y
06-02-2019T18:50:22,Ordithus,Poof cat?
06-02-2019T18:50:33,Xexanoth,then post a picture now
06-02-2019T18:50:47,Xexanoth,pretty sure it's illegal to talk about fluffy cats without posting pictures
06-02-2019T18:50:55,Xexanoth,and if not it should be
06-02-2019T18:51:56,Bgrmystr2,pictures or go home

06-02-2019T18:55:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Sommoned via puff mew
06-02-2019T18:55:28,Dadrobit,I was actually talking a bout the furries shedding lol.
06-02-2019T18:57:03,unsteddyphoenix,Shes so chubby <3
06-02-2019T18:57:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Ok
06-02-2019T18:57:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Rude
06-02-2019T18:58:50,SpazztasticKiwi,(Yes. She’s on a diet. No grain/dye food with serving sizes)
06-02-2019T19:01:11,unsteddyphoenix,Gotta cut those carbs
06-02-2019T19:05:39,Dadrobit,Heartwarming video of the day https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEuOBFRDesA
06-02-2019T19:22:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Every time I hear southern I feel sorry for anyone who’s ever heard me speak
06-02-2019T19:27:48,unsteddyphoenix,"Why, its amazing"
06-02-2019T19:28:47,unsteddyphoenix,Awh they saved ut
06-02-2019T19:28:54,unsteddyphoenix,Wait its tiny how'd it get up there
06-02-2019T19:30:31,Xexanoth,it climbe?
06-02-2019T19:30:36,Xexanoth,*d
06-02-2019T19:31:01,Xexanoth,"or maybe it rode a caterpillar, we'll never know"
06-02-2019T19:33:29,unsteddyphoenix,Equally likely scenarios
06-02-2019T19:33:51,Bgrmystr2,cats climb. Imagine that.
06-02-2019T19:45:26,Dadrobit,"You say ""caterpillar"" and I think of a large construction vehicle. I was very confused as to how you thought a tractor carrying a kitten got into a tree..."
06-02-2019T19:46:54,Xexanoth,pretty easily i'd imagine
06-02-2019T19:47:08,Xexanoth,just drive into it XD
06-02-2019T19:47:18,Bgrmystr2,tree would definitely not support the weight
06-02-2019T19:47:29,Bgrmystr2,unless that was a BIG honkin tree
06-02-2019T19:54:43,Xexanoth,"if tree is under tractor, tractor is technicially in tree :ptv-SteelwormHades:"
06-02-2019T20:03:13,Bgrmystr2,"I would say the tree is underneath the tractor since the tractor is on the ground.. it matters what's holding up the weight, not actually what happens to be underneath"
06-02-2019T20:06:39,RimaDraws,hii
06-02-2019T20:07:58,Ordithus,:cw0lfmare-Paperember: hello
06-02-2019T20:08:06,Bgrmystr2,Hello
06-02-2019T20:08:11,RimaDraws,hi ord and bgr
06-02-2019T20:09:12,RimaDraws,do you guys know what tom will be looking for the second artist to do for him when he gets one?
06-02-2019T20:09:47,Bgrmystr2,"Line art, if I recall correctly"
06-02-2019T20:09:51,Bgrmystr2,among other things
06-02-2019T20:09:59,RimaDraws,that's what i figured
06-02-2019T20:10:08,RimaDraws,i was going to ask him myself but...he's not on
06-02-2019T20:10:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Do good lines
06-02-2019T20:10:38,SpazztasticKiwi,He was early this morning. Must be real busy
06-02-2019T20:10:46,RimaDraws,oh well then i missed him..
06-02-2019T20:11:10,RimaDraws,i was at work
06-02-2019T20:11:12,SpazztasticKiwi,And by this morning I mean he spammed some nibblies and poofed
06-02-2019T20:11:26,Ordithus,Seems normal
06-02-2019T20:11:47,RimaDraws,well good to know someone knows what he is looking for the second artist to do.
06-02-2019T20:13:20,RimaDraws,:ptv-uneasy:
06-02-2019T20:14:31,SpazztasticKiwi,He needs help
06-02-2019T20:14:42,SpazztasticKiwi,But he also needs help to get the help
06-02-2019T20:14:50,RimaDraws,i mean i would offer
06-02-2019T20:14:55,RimaDraws,but that is his choice
06-02-2019T20:16:11,SpazztasticKiwi,I know. He’s also got to consider this is gonna be a person he’ll have to share contact info with AND his work
06-02-2019T20:16:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Sticky territory
06-02-2019T20:17:25,RimaDraws,well i wouldn't do that hell i am nervous about my own privacy lol
06-02-2019T20:17:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I know you do digital and work like his - I stick to mainly fancy lettering and stylized lines
06-02-2019T20:17:53,RimaDraws,i am not that person lol. that is a no no to me.
06-02-2019T20:18:03,RimaDraws,i wold love to try for him
06-02-2019T20:18:06,RimaDraws,would
06-02-2019T20:18:07,RimaDraws,omg
06-02-2019T20:18:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m kinda the same way. Why I have a password on all my electronics. Even the flash drives
06-02-2019T20:18:56,RimaDraws,i hear you there. i am so cautious about my things
06-02-2019T20:19:03,RimaDraws,i dont let anyone touch my phone
06-02-2019T20:19:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve been asked what I have to hide and it’s not that I got things to hide - it’s I’m cautious about my information and people need to mind their own damn business
06-02-2019T20:19:37,RimaDraws,exactly. i just have my bank app on my phone too so thats another thing
06-02-2019T20:19:43,RimaDraws,my money information is on there
06-02-2019T20:20:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Bank app yeah. All my accounts on anything log out automatically and requires my password every time their opened
06-02-2019T20:20:43,SpazztasticKiwi,they’re
06-02-2019T20:20:57,SpazztasticKiwi,And the passwords all differ of course
06-02-2019T20:21:01,RimaDraws,i love my new phone because it is face ID now. so now no one can use it lol
06-02-2019T20:21:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Even if you sneak over my shoulder for my password it’s not the same as the others
06-02-2019T20:21:39,RimaDraws,nope lol
06-02-2019T20:21:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah I went to get y phone looked at today. A local guys gonna order some parts and can fix it
06-02-2019T20:22:27,SpazztasticKiwi,So I’m likely not gonna get a trade in. Which is fine - gotten attached to this phone
06-02-2019T20:23:41,SpazztasticKiwi,I have been looking at the different models though - I’m not sure if I can adjust to no headphone jack or no home button or face ID only
06-02-2019T20:24:56,RimaDraws,well i just charge when i can and i use my iphone headphones.
06-02-2019T20:25:09,RimaDraws,still.
06-02-2019T20:25:18,RimaDraws,i did finish that madelyn drawing kiwi
06-02-2019T20:25:54,SpazztasticKiwi,I..
06-02-2019T20:26:07,SpazztasticKiwi,May have seen it. Unless you did something extra to it
06-02-2019T20:26:40,RimaDraws,no
06-02-2019T20:26:43,RimaDraws,nothing extra
06-02-2019T20:26:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Cheek poofs
06-02-2019T20:26:55,RimaDraws,https://pre00.deviantart.net/0be4/th/pre/i/2019/037/7/b/older_madelyn__colored__by_rimadraws-dcz39xj.png
06-02-2019T20:26:56,RimaDraws,yeeee
06-02-2019T20:27:31,SpazztasticKiwi,She looks like a real young woman
06-02-2019T20:27:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Just with hair. Everywhere
06-02-2019T20:27:52,RimaDraws,i do try. her ears and cheek poofs gave me a bit of hell
06-02-2019T20:28:50,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-maddiessparkles:
06-02-2019T20:29:02,RimaDraws,^^
06-02-2019T20:31:26,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve redone some of my things
06-02-2019T20:31:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Like the seahorse that I never posted for Mandy
06-02-2019T20:31:43,RimaDraws,oooh
06-02-2019T20:31:48,SpazztasticKiwi,But it looks better to me at least
06-02-2019T20:32:20,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m ... not feeling the alien anymore so it’s likely to just get scrapped
06-02-2019T20:33:21,Xexanoth,"oh, nice pic Rima, though you might want to put the watermark not in the middle of the face, kinda makes it look weird."
06-02-2019T20:36:09,RimaDraws,I still do that and the water mark isn’t on the original
06-02-2019T20:36:37,RimaDraws,I don’t trust people on deviantart or anywhere because they can still photoshop my signature out
06-02-2019T20:45:22,Mippy,Oh it’s Rima’s :ctwokinds-maddiessparkles: that I saw last night
06-02-2019T20:46:20,Mippy,I’m exited to star suggesting things again this week
06-02-2019T20:46:23,unsteddyphoenix,"Oooh that looks nice Rima, great work!"
06-02-2019T20:48:06,RimaDraws,Thank you ^^
06-02-2019T20:49:56,RimaDraws,I honestly wanna try linearting and coloring Basitin euchre
06-02-2019T20:50:30,Mippy,"Yes, very cute. I need to do more arts for pleasure. It’s all “fine arts” now"
06-02-2019T20:50:42,RimaDraws,i wanna start painting again.
06-02-2019T20:51:36,Mippy,Never too late. I’m actually doing a Masters Copy in my painting class right now.
06-02-2019T20:52:06,RimaDraws,well i need to get ready for the FCE cultural arts fair to win some ribbons
06-02-2019T20:52:30,Mippy,Go get the ribbons Rima!
06-02-2019T20:52:36,RimaDraws,"i won a blue ribbon, two red ribbons , a white ribbon, and a green honorable mention ribbon last year"
06-02-2019T20:53:15,RimaDraws,i have a scrap book of a few more that i won
06-02-2019T20:53:26,Mippy,Dang! I’ve won...nothing...because unless you like rodeos nothing cool happens in Alberta
06-02-2019T20:53:59,RimaDraws,well i mostly do the cultural arts fair for fun. but winning the ribbons are good too
06-02-2019T20:55:17,Mippy,"Nothing wrong with fun. I might submit a piece for a local show next year...you know...for the hell of it, but also to potentially get my name out there."
06-02-2019T20:55:25,unsteddyphoenix,Go for gold!
06-02-2019T20:55:29,unsteddyphoenix,"Or, blue. Whichever"

06-02-2019T20:57:13,unsteddyphoenix,Oooh~ :clap::clap::clap:
06-02-2019T20:57:21,RimaDraws,i skipped 2017 because i didnt have time
06-02-2019T20:57:21,Mippy,Noice :ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
06-02-2019T20:57:23,unsteddyphoenix,Are theres from drawing alone? Or other things?
06-02-2019T20:57:40,RimaDraws,these were from drawings or art class arts i did on paper
06-02-2019T20:58:19,unsteddyphoenix,Nice nice
06-02-2019T20:58:45,Mippy,Not bad at all
06-02-2019T20:58:57,RimaDraws,"now last years i won the blue for my clay project, my impasto painting got red ribbon, my color painting third, and my green ribbon was a black and white painting"
06-02-2019T20:59:15,RimaDraws,oh and my water bottle sculpture got red
06-02-2019T20:59:31,Mippy,I borked a black and white painting
06-02-2019T20:59:58,RimaDraws,"i made a water bottle sculpture out of water bottles, wire, and using a heat gun"
06-02-2019T21:00:43,Mippy,I’m looking forward to sculpture class. Took a clay class in high school and really liked it.
06-02-2019T21:01:43,Mippy,That sounds like a reasonable bunch of material.
06-02-2019T21:02:17,Mippy,I guess I got to go back to work though :ctwokinds-clovisgirl_shake:
06-02-2019T21:02:33,RimaDraws,yea i thought i couldnt mimic mueck but i got it down
06-02-2019T21:03:37,RimaDraws,mueck he is a sculpture artist that makes hyperrealistic sculptures of people. and they are so lifelike but i used a material he used and amplified the size of the thing i wanted to do
06-02-2019T21:03:53,RimaDraws,he used alot of plastic resin. so i used water bottles
06-02-2019T21:04:44,RimaDraws,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/486633926408929281/543250235137458186/image1.jpg this is the water bottle i did
06-02-2019T21:13:09,Dadrobit,"Heh, only award I ever really got in for myself that I really cherish was my ""Spark Plug"" award in marching band back in high school. Most everything else was just ""honors"" awards for high grades."
06-02-2019T21:13:32,Dadrobit,And maybe my John Phillip Sousa award is up there as well I suppose.
06-02-2019T21:14:26,RimaDraws,well i cant play an instrument that well or do science. my art is all i have
06-02-2019T21:14:43,RimaDraws,i didnt get any honors awards for high grades
06-02-2019T21:16:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I wasn’t liked enough for my art
06-02-2019T21:16:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Grades were all I had
06-02-2019T21:16:23,Dadrobit,Marching band was my jam. We were super heckin' good. Got to go to national events with it. Won first place in the second division bracket my junior year at one competition in Texas. Got to play the halftime show for the collegiate bowl finals that way.
06-02-2019T21:17:30,RimaDraws,the only time i did well in band enough was i was the only bass clarinet to play in a state concert
06-02-2019T21:17:46,RimaDraws,and the only one picked from my middle school
06-02-2019T21:18:04,Dadrobit,"Very fond memories there. Got the spark plug award my senior year. It was because ""if the spark plug is the piece of the machine that lights the flame that gets every other part in motion, I was the spark plug of the band."""
06-02-2019T21:18:28,Dadrobit,"Also, because my father taught automotive at that school, so they thought it'd be a funny tie in."
06-02-2019T21:19:31,RimaDraws,but yea art is all i have to offer. if i could play an instrument again it would be a clarinet
06-02-2019T21:20:35,Dadrobit,"Euphonium. If I had the money, I'd get back into it in a heartbeat. I've always been ""meh"" at other art. But music was where I was home."
06-02-2019T21:21:43,Dadrobit,"And before you ask, yes, I have watched ""Hibike! Euphonium""."
06-02-2019T21:22:10,RimaDraws,i dont know what that is
06-02-2019T21:23:10,Dadrobit,Anime. Centered around a girl in high school who used to play euphonium and gets roped into joining the new school's band club.
06-02-2019T21:23:38,Dadrobit,Kyoto Animation
