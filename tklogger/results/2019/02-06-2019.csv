02-06-2019T06:47:38,Twokinds,I didn't sleep all night!
02-06-2019T06:49:49,BadFoMo,I didn't too!
02-06-2019T06:51:08,iliar,What happened?
02-06-2019T06:52:18,Twokinds,Decided to pull an all-nighter
02-06-2019T06:52:29,Twokinds,Trying to get this comic ready for print before the cons next month.
02-06-2019T06:53:53,iliar,Ready to print?  What comic book are you talking about?
02-06-2019T06:54:10,iliar,"Vol 5, ArtBook vol 2"
02-06-2019T06:54:19,iliar,or something else
02-06-2019T06:54:23,Twokinds,MM1
02-06-2019T06:55:33,iliar,You already color it?
02-06-2019T06:55:58,Twokinds,That's what I'm working on.
02-06-2019T06:55:58,BadFoMo,So what we saw at the end of the stream was a bonis picture?
02-06-2019T06:56:15,Twokinds,I've been pretty much killing myself the last three weeks getting it all ready.
02-06-2019T06:56:26,Twokinds,Working from the moment I wake up to sleep.
02-06-2019T06:56:38,BadFoMo,Dang.
02-06-2019T06:56:55,iliar,I was sure that you color Nibs first.
02-06-2019T06:57:30,Twokinds,?
02-06-2019T06:58:32,iliar,My March Nora Card
02-06-2019T06:59:17,BadFoMo,So how much will the colored version be going for and will it be avalable online?
02-06-2019T07:00:02,iliar,Magical Mishaps - Story 1 Page 13 Panel 4
02-06-2019T07:00:34,Twokinds,I have to get this done
02-06-2019T07:02:09,TerraTheWizard,oh dang
02-06-2019T07:28:16,Twokinds,I don't really have any info on price or availability yet
02-06-2019T07:47:04,BadFoMo,Ok.
02-06-2019T07:47:21,BadFoMo,We'll see what happens.
02-06-2019T08:12:04,SpazztasticKiwi,I slept like
02-06-2019T08:12:08,SpazztasticKiwi,5 hours?
02-06-2019T08:12:27,SpazztasticKiwi,And woke up what felt like every other hour
02-06-2019T08:37:45,AspiringNoodle,"I'm so confused.  I finally slept a normal amount of hours, and I feel fine."
02-06-2019T08:40:13,SpazztasticKiwi,When the amount of rest you got was suspicious 😒
02-06-2019T08:41:44,SpazztasticKiwi,I feel like death warmed over probably better if I had stayed up
02-06-2019T08:41:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Done it before and hey I’m still youngish
02-06-2019T08:54:42,AspiringNoodle,I've had days where I've slept for a solid 4 hours and went through the day no problem.  But try to do that again and I feel like I am going to keel over.
02-06-2019T08:55:04,AspiringNoodle,"Biology (and by extension, sleep) is weird."

02-06-2019T16:06:15,RimaDraws,Hey
02-06-2019T16:08:53,AspiringNoodle,"Random thought:  If drawing food could make it appear for real, manga and anime artists would be the most popular chefs :p"
02-06-2019T16:12:18,RimaDraws,Yee
02-06-2019T16:13:17,AspiringNoodle,My first argument: breakfast from Howl's Moving Castle.
02-06-2019T16:13:28,AspiringNoodle,That breakfast makes real breakfast look like a joke.
02-06-2019T16:13:41,RimaDraws,It totally does
02-06-2019T16:13:47,RimaDraws,Also spirited away
02-06-2019T16:14:01,AspiringNoodle,I want that bacon :ptv-whiny:
02-06-2019T16:14:53,AspiringNoodle,I can't remember if Studio Ghibli Fest is doing Spirited Away this year.  But I want to see it <3
02-06-2019T16:15:46,AspiringNoodle,"I don't even know what half the stuff they were eating, I just know that I want to eat it."
02-06-2019T16:15:56,RimaDraws,It looks good
02-06-2019T16:16:42,AspiringNoodle,"I can't remember if there was any good looking food in Kiki's Delivery Service, but I know that film is up this year."
02-06-2019T16:17:42,AspiringNoodle,"Man... now I'm hungry, and any food I get is gonna be a disappointment :ptv-sad:"
02-06-2019T16:45:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Forget the food. Howl looks pretty delicious himself
02-06-2019T17:21:53,AspiringNoodle,LEWD
02-06-2019T17:25:49,SpazztasticKiwi,got a pair of sleep shorts and just looking at them they look big in the waist
02-06-2019T17:31:01,SpazztasticKiwi,might actually use em when I get home. Seems Tom has finally fainted from his all nighter
02-06-2019T17:34:59,Twokinds,Nopee
02-06-2019T17:35:19,SpazztasticKiwi,and I’m not shocked either
02-06-2019T17:36:21,SpazztasticKiwi,my nails are now long enough I can file them to points
02-06-2019T17:36:42,SpazztasticKiwi,unfortunately I’ve been stabbing my self more than anything
02-06-2019T17:47:07,RimaDraws,Oh my. Also Tom please don’t push yourself too hard.
02-06-2019T17:47:14,AspiringNoodle,"Speaking from experience, once you stay up long enough, the adrenaline kicks in and you feel fine :p"
02-06-2019T17:48:47,TerraTheWizard,and then you never sleep
02-06-2019T17:48:49,TerraTheWizard,and you ded

02-06-2019T17:51:17,AspiringNoodle,But it's so much fun trying to get to sleep when your heart is trying punch its way out of your chest :ptv-hearts:
02-06-2019T17:51:58,AspiringNoodle,"Also, RIP.  Apparently I missed an Affinity sale.  Ended 2 months ago :("
02-06-2019T17:52:07,AspiringNoodle,Guess I'm buying CSP!
02-06-2019T17:52:30,RimaDraws,Yea I missed that too but bought full csp ex
02-06-2019T17:53:28,TerraTheWizard,good thing about clip is it goes on sale 4 times a year :P

02-06-2019T17:56:04,SpazztasticKiwi,just stay away from stairs and cliffs for your inevitable crash Tom. Stubbornness can only get you so far at 32
02-06-2019T17:56:15,SpazztasticKiwi,I rounded
02-06-2019T17:56:56,AspiringNoodle,Imagine a future where you don't need to sleep
02-06-2019T17:57:05,Twokinds,I want it
02-06-2019T17:57:12,AspiringNoodle,They have medicine that provides all the benefits without any of the downtime
02-06-2019T17:57:35,AspiringNoodle,Society would probably change on a fundamental level.
02-06-2019T17:57:47,AspiringNoodle,"That, or people would have an extra 7 - 9 hours of freetime :D"
02-06-2019T17:58:18,Bgrmystr2,"both, noodle."
02-06-2019T17:58:29,RimaDraws,But sadly we need sleep
02-06-2019T17:58:43,AspiringNoodle,LIKE HELL WE DO!

02-06-2019T17:59:39,SpazztasticKiwi,who the hell actually gets 7 hours
02-06-2019T18:00:11,AspiringNoodle,"As in actually gets that much time to sleep, or can survive on it?"
02-06-2019T18:00:47,AspiringNoodle,"Because I could probably survive on it, I just need to lose another 90 lbs :D"
02-06-2019T18:02:41,RimaDraws,I can survive on 6 - 6 1/2 hours of sleep anymore than 8 I feel like crap
02-06-2019T18:04:51,AspiringNoodle,I know that feeling.  My problem is that I have a tendency to oversleep.
02-06-2019T18:05:08,AspiringNoodle,"Feels good, until you get up for the day >_>"
02-06-2019T18:17:08,SpazztasticKiwi,"after like 2 weeks of salty snake, she had shed"
02-06-2019T18:17:30,SpazztasticKiwi,now we count the times I see the skin drying out and think she’s somehow got out of the cage

02-06-2019T18:42:54,RimaDraws,my cat begs for food and then when i give it to him he wont eat it
02-06-2019T18:43:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera tried eating anything that doesn’t try biting him first
02-06-2019T18:43:37,RimaDraws,lol
02-06-2019T18:44:09,SpazztasticKiwi,"like moths, lizards, flies, basically anything that moves"
02-06-2019T18:44:31,SpazztasticKiwi,that time he found a wasp I discovered a 10 pound cat is braver than I am
02-06-2019T18:45:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"speaking of Bagheera, he just fell off the bed"
02-06-2019T18:46:00,RimaDraws,oh yea
02-06-2019T18:46:20,RimaDraws,i wouldnt touch a wasp
02-06-2019T18:48:12,RimaDraws,my cat eats spiders and then he will get sick
02-06-2019T18:49:37,SpazztasticKiwi,he’s caught a few of those too
02-06-2019T18:50:10,SpazztasticKiwi,“Bagheera no. No. We do not eat spiders. Leave it. Bagheerastop”
02-06-2019T18:50:30,RimaDraws,and proceeds to chase and eat it
02-06-2019T18:51:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"I just know when he’s bapping at something in the corner, he’s got something and he’s likely going to try to eat it next"
02-06-2019T18:51:56,RimaDraws,lol yea thats qrow
02-06-2019T18:52:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"and if it’s a lizard or something similar, it turns into “what do you have?” *sprints off with prize*"
02-06-2019T18:53:29,RimaDraws,pfft
02-06-2019T18:53:34,SpazztasticKiwi,My sister saved a lizard from him once. Poor thing had wondered in when the door had been open and it was just about like that
02-06-2019T18:53:48,RimaDraws,poor lizard
02-06-2019T18:54:16,SpazztasticKiwi,When he was cornered with the thing in his mouth my sister sat there for a good minute trying to get him to say ahh
02-06-2019T18:55:06,RimaDraws,so you've had him a long time?
02-06-2019T18:55:20,SpazztasticKiwi,He’s three July 28th

02-06-2019T19:05:20,RimaDraws,mines nearing 2
02-06-2019T19:13:04,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve found one of my favorite clips of Loki. Hiddleston’s on stage at SDCC and some guy yells out “my wife loves you”
02-06-2019T19:13:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Shocks Tom so hard he breaks character
02-06-2019T19:13:52,RimaDraws,awwww
02-06-2019T19:13:54,RimaDraws,lol
02-06-2019T19:16:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Another one from I believe the next year the same guy yells “my wife still loves you”
02-06-2019T19:16:39,SpazztasticKiwi,One of the many reasons SDCC would pay off. Hiddleston
02-06-2019T19:18:26,RimaDraws,XD
02-06-2019T19:20:06,AspiringNoodle,...I should get a pet.  #ForeverAlone
02-06-2019T19:20:30,AspiringNoodle,"I would ask ""cat or dog"", but I think this crowd is pretty biased!"
02-06-2019T19:21:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t mind big dogs. I just despise those demonic lil shits
02-06-2019T19:21:50,RimaDraws,i like both
02-06-2019T19:21:58,RimaDraws,i had a dachshund
02-06-2019T19:22:02,AspiringNoodle,"If I had to choose a dog, I might go Samoyed.  THEY'RE SO FLUFFY :ptv-excited:"
02-06-2019T19:22:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Have fun with the brushing
02-06-2019T19:23:06,AspiringNoodle,Who could resist brushing such a good doggo?
02-06-2019T19:23:27,AspiringNoodle,Brushy brushy :ptv-hearts:
02-06-2019T19:25:46,AspiringNoodle,"On the other hand, if I had to get a cat, I wouldn't mind a black cat, a calico, or whatever breed Church was."
02-06-2019T19:26:18,RimaDraws,omg watching the horror compilation 11 mark had and i never heard his voice go so high or lose it lol
02-06-2019T19:27:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Mark’s voice range is interesting
02-06-2019T19:27:33,RimaDraws,it is
02-06-2019T19:27:37,SpazztasticKiwi,He can go surprisingly high at a graceful rate for someone with such a low voice
02-06-2019T19:27:37,RimaDraws,i about died laughing
02-06-2019T19:28:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Someone needs to do a comp of his oddest phrases
02-06-2019T19:28:08,RimaDraws,lol
02-06-2019T19:28:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Some stuff he says is...contemplative
02-06-2019T19:28:45,AspiringNoodle,"IIRC, Markiplier lowers his voice a tad."
02-06-2019T19:28:52,SpazztasticKiwi,“I’m jiggling the wiggler”
02-06-2019T19:29:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Alrighty Mark. I’ll take your word for it
02-06-2019T19:29:22,RimaDraws,i watched his help wanted stuff its funny
02-06-2019T19:29:36,SpazztasticKiwi,The most concerning was “are those boobs or eyes”
02-06-2019T19:29:41,AspiringNoodle,"Personally, I love Jacksepticeye :P"
02-06-2019T19:29:50,AspiringNoodle,Markiplier is somewhat hit or miss for me

02-06-2019T19:30:44,AspiringNoodle,DON'T LICK ANYTHING
02-06-2019T19:30:47,SpazztasticKiwi,I remember the video that Mark Seán Bob and Wade did when Seán kept telling them to go to the green flag
02-06-2019T19:30:50,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-reniderp::ctwokinds-keith8D::ctwokinds-reniderp_flip:
02-06-2019T19:31:02,AspiringNoodle,"Take out the Keith, and then that'd be hilarious"

02-06-2019T19:31:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Prop hunt or something. Problem was no one could find this green flag
02-06-2019T19:31:15,Ordithus,I like it better with the keef
02-06-2019T19:31:33,Ordithus,Yeah that group has some great chemistry
02-06-2019T19:31:35,SpazztasticKiwi,"For context, Seán is green/blue/yellow colorblind"
02-06-2019T19:31:46,SpazztasticKiwi,They asked the colorblind one to find the flag
02-06-2019T19:31:55,AspiringNoodle,*facepalm*
02-06-2019T19:32:21,SpazztasticKiwi,"Mark finally found what Seán was talking about. “You know this is a yellow flag, right?”"
02-06-2019T19:32:46,SpazztasticKiwi,It was then they realized they’d asked the colorblind one to look for the flag
02-06-2019T19:32:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Bless them
02-06-2019T19:33:07,RimaDraws,lol
02-06-2019T19:33:21,Bgrmystr2,has he not gotten those color glasses things
02-06-2019T19:33:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah but he doesn’t use them
02-06-2019T19:33:59,AspiringNoodle,"As someone who wears glasses:  The moment my eyesight stops changing, i'm opting for surgery >:D"
02-06-2019T19:34:03,Bgrmystr2,the fuck are they for then xD
02-06-2019T19:34:20,SpazztasticKiwi,That vr FNAF game he played gave him a bit of trouble when it pulled a green button/yellow button thing on him
02-06-2019T19:34:32,Bgrmystr2,"noodle, don't expect that to ever come. Even if your eyes ""stop"" getting worse, they do end up slowly getting worse as time goes on anyway"
02-06-2019T19:34:32,Ordithus,haha
02-06-2019T19:34:34,Bgrmystr2,you can't stop them
02-06-2019T19:34:34,Ordithus,poor guy
02-06-2019T19:34:35,RimaDraws,who sean?
02-06-2019T19:34:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Subtle difference in shade but it was enough to get him
02-06-2019T19:34:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Jacksepticeye
02-06-2019T19:34:49,RimaDraws,yea
02-06-2019T19:35:19,Ordithus,Supposedly you get more farsighted as you age
02-06-2019T19:35:23,Ordithus,I hope that is true
02-06-2019T19:35:33,Bgrmystr2,haha that sounds like a load of bs
02-06-2019T19:35:37,Ordithus,Probably
02-06-2019T19:35:44,Ordithus,For sure the range you can focus at shrinks
02-06-2019T19:36:03,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, also the fact that people that are near-sighted do NOT get better eyesight as they age xD"
02-06-2019T19:36:10,Bgrmystr2,so.. I'm gonna call 100% crap
02-06-2019T19:36:20,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-LauraCry: stupid reality crushing my dreams
02-06-2019T19:36:32,Bgrmystr2,"It's okay, Ord. I'm blind so I can't see your dreams."
02-06-2019T19:36:35,Bgrmystr2,:)
02-06-2019T19:36:44,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-rainehappy:*[yay?]
02-06-2019T19:36:47,AspiringNoodle,My eyesight isn't *terrible* but it is bad enough to require glasses.
02-06-2019T19:36:53,AspiringNoodle,"For driving, I mean"
02-06-2019T19:36:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Haven’t seen that horror comp from Mark yet. I have a movie rn and was gonna play one of  Seán’s
02-06-2019T19:37:01,SpazztasticKiwi,after
02-06-2019T19:37:29,Bgrmystr2,"I think my eyes are bad enough at the moment that even if I did take a driving test, I still legally could not drive."
02-06-2019T19:37:40,Bgrmystr2,while wearing glasses.
02-06-2019T19:38:53,Ordithus,I got mine when I found out I couldn't fly without them.  Turns out they're good to have all the time though
02-06-2019T19:39:02,SpazztasticKiwi,If you want a bowl full of giggles though watch Mark and Ethan play Mario cart
02-06-2019T19:39:16,Ordithus,I stopped the flying thing after the third lesson - way way too expensive a hobby
02-06-2019T19:39:28,SpazztasticKiwi,though it’s if you don’t mind some vulgarity that’s not curse related
02-06-2019T19:40:03,Ordithus,watched some of that a few years back
02-06-2019T19:40:04,Sclimshady,Anyone else not able to pull up the comic from friday?
02-06-2019T19:40:24,Ordithus,It hasn't been posted yet
02-06-2019T19:40:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Anyone remember when Mark said hello to the darkness and he regretted it because it responded?
02-06-2019T19:40:54,Sclimshady,"I figured, I just couldnt see anything on the social medias about that"
02-06-2019T19:41:23,Ordithus,He posts on social media when he updates - or if it has been forever
02-06-2019T19:41:32,SpazztasticKiwi,or when he spend something like 10 minutes looking for a door code and it was written in bold ink on the wall behind him
02-06-2019T19:41:35,Ordithus,"""I'm not dead I swear"""
02-06-2019T19:41:42,Sclimshady,Fair enough
02-06-2019T19:42:23,Sclimshady,I haven't social mediaed in like a year
02-06-2019T19:47:16,SpazztasticKiwi,& Seán did a interview with Chris Hemsworth yesterday
02-06-2019T20:02:16,AspiringNoodle,"I haven't social media'd like, ever xD"
02-06-2019T20:02:31,AspiringNoodle,"Twitter is best used for non-political things, apparently."
02-06-2019T20:06:45,Ordithus,Social media should be for friends and family - political crap is one reason I stopped using fb.  Blegh :ptv-grossedout:
02-06-2019T20:06:58,AspiringNoodle,"Well, you're in luck then!"
02-06-2019T20:07:12,Bgrmystr2,I never used it to begin with.
02-06-2019T20:07:19,AspiringNoodle,Studies / data analysis show 2 shocking things about Twitter (though this could probably extend to FB as well)
02-06-2019T20:07:35,Ordithus,Not missing out on anything anymore bgr.  Debatable if you ever did
02-06-2019T20:07:43,AspiringNoodle,1)  The site props up the extremes.  The middle literally doesn't exist.  The platform boosts up the craziest and loudest voices on the platform.
02-06-2019T20:08:11,AspiringNoodle,2)  And I'm not joking.  A study was done and found that using Twitter for politics lowers your IQ
02-06-2019T20:08:17,AspiringNoodle,"That's right, social media makes you DUMBER"
02-06-2019T20:08:45,Bgrmystr2,"oh, no I know exactly what I missed Ord. That's why I never got into it. It's all garbage."
02-06-2019T20:10:14,AspiringNoodle,"I'm trying my hardest to stop watching ANYTHING politics related, but it's really hard.  The only person I consistently watch videos from is Tim Pool :/"
02-06-2019T20:10:27,AspiringNoodle,Politics is the new crack.
02-06-2019T20:35:12,RimaDraws,i use it all the time and im pretty smart
02-06-2019T21:22:29,SpazztasticKiwi,self fact checking and gulliblity lead to loss of intelligence
02-06-2019T21:22:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Not social media itself
02-06-2019T21:24:11,Sclimshady,"I use twitter for art, otters, and dogs/foxes"
02-06-2019T21:24:24,Sclimshady,but I dont post much
02-06-2019T21:27:33,Sclimshady,Everyone should check out the Monteray bay aquariums pinned tweet
02-06-2019T21:58:26,SpazztasticKiwi,My laziness level is happy I went for the touchscreen laptop model
