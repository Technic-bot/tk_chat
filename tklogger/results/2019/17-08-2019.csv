17-08-2019T06:49:31,SniperJackal,kinda took a bit of a break from it
17-08-2019T06:51:38,CrimsonQuill,I showed my brother season 4 on Thursday or Friday.
17-08-2019T06:51:47,CrimsonQuill,He loved the end of it.
17-08-2019T06:52:10,CrimsonQuill,"'It's coming all the way from Earth! It could take days, or weeks, or months, or even years!'"
17-08-2019T06:52:15,CrimsonQuill,*THUNK

17-08-2019T06:52:53,SniperJackal,Im at the start of 8
17-08-2019T06:53:01,CrimsonQuill,One of the best.
17-08-2019T06:53:10,SniperJackal,well Il go watch it tommorow
17-08-2019T06:53:36,CrimsonQuill,I showed my brother and sister the 'Laser face' meme a while back.
17-08-2019T06:53:48,CrimsonQuill,Now they want to see the episode in which it was born.
17-08-2019T06:54:03,CrimsonQuill,I have exams tomorrow.
17-08-2019T06:54:04,CrimsonQuill,Maths.
17-08-2019T06:54:13,SniperJackal,oh bollocks
17-08-2019T06:54:21,CrimsonQuill,Yep.
17-08-2019T06:54:27,CrimsonQuill,"Bother, bother and blast."
17-08-2019T06:54:32,SniperJackal,never bothered too much with that
17-08-2019T06:54:35,CrimsonQuill,Then Geodetic on Tuesday.
17-08-2019T06:54:43,CrimsonQuill,Fundamentals of GIS on Wednesday.
17-08-2019T06:54:50,CrimsonQuill,"nO, Thursday."
17-08-2019T06:55:06,CrimsonQuill,"And Spatial Analysis the following Tuesday, on the 27th."
17-08-2019T06:55:26,CrimsonQuill,"So I'll miss a lot of the stream tonight, because I have to be up at a reasonable hour."
17-08-2019T06:55:42,SniperJackal,Im just enjoying the last weeks of summer holidays
17-08-2019T06:55:54,SniperJackal,oh ok
17-08-2019T06:56:35,CrimsonQuill,But after that
17-08-2019T06:56:49,CrimsonQuill,I have two solid weeks and a bit before University startds back up.
17-08-2019T06:57:12,SniperJackal,what are you studying for
17-08-2019T06:57:13,CrimsonQuill,I'm debating with myself whether to re-read the comic again for the umpteenth time.
17-08-2019T06:57:21,CrimsonQuill,Land Surveying
17-08-2019T06:57:33,SniperJackal,nice
17-08-2019T06:57:55,SniperJackal,oh did you read the latest comic
17-08-2019T06:57:58,SniperJackal,page
17-08-2019T06:58:05,CrimsonQuill,Did you see the new Halo Infinite Lore theory video by Installation 00
17-08-2019T06:58:13,CrimsonQuill,Oh I haven't seen that pagew yet
17-08-2019T06:58:21,SniperJackal,"no, Ill go check it out"
17-08-2019T06:58:30,CrimsonQuill,I might just reread bits of my favourite chapters
17-08-2019T06:58:34,CrimsonQuill,But at present
17-08-2019T06:58:40,CrimsonQuill,I don't feel like I am worthy yet
17-08-2019T06:58:47,CrimsonQuill,I need to get through some of my exams first
17-08-2019T06:58:53,SniperJackal,usually I watch HiddenXperia
17-08-2019T06:58:58,SniperJackal,the flood boi
17-08-2019T06:59:03,CrimsonQuill,I love him
17-08-2019T06:59:12,SniperJackal,well good luck with exams I guess
17-08-2019T06:59:16,CrimsonQuill,He played Firefight with Ubernick
17-08-2019T06:59:20,CrimsonQuill,Thanks mate.
17-08-2019T06:59:31,CrimsonQuill,I have a big mug of tea with me
17-08-2019T06:59:34,CrimsonQuill,It was funny
17-08-2019T06:59:55,CrimsonQuill,"I had trouble with a maths problem, and my sister tried to help because she's good at maths."
17-08-2019T07:00:02,CrimsonQuill,But she couldn't do it either.
17-08-2019T07:00:09,CrimsonQuill,So we called out friend...
17-08-2019T07:00:15,CrimsonQuill,Who is a GOD at maths.
17-08-2019T07:00:22,SniperJackal,still didnt get it?
17-08-2019T07:00:29,CrimsonQuill,And she helped me with the solution.
17-08-2019T07:00:37,CrimsonQuill,So I'm all set on that front.
17-08-2019T07:00:45,CrimsonQuill,I just have to remember the formulae and things.
17-08-2019T07:00:54,CrimsonQuill,Then I'm home dry.
17-08-2019T07:01:38,SniperJackal,I looked up if squatting is ok instead of sitting because I usually automatically squat
17-08-2019T07:01:50,SniperJackal,and I realised that its actually healthier
17-08-2019T07:02:12,CrimsonQuill,Really?
17-08-2019T07:02:15,CrimsonQuill,Muscle stuff?7
17-08-2019T07:02:38,SniperJackal,no more of a resting squat
17-08-2019T07:02:51,CrimsonQuill,Like Boris in Life of Boris
17-08-2019T07:02:55,CrimsonQuill,The Slave Squat
17-08-2019T07:02:57,CrimsonQuill,That it?
17-08-2019T07:02:59,SniperJackal,pretty much
17-08-2019T07:03:03,CrimsonQuill,Ok
17-08-2019T07:03:05,CrimsonQuill,I can do it
17-08-2019T07:03:11,CrimsonQuill,I just find it a bit tricky to maintain
17-08-2019T07:03:18,SniperJackal,I dont know if its exactly like that
17-08-2019T07:03:22,CrimsonQuill,wELLL
17-08-2019T07:03:28,SniperJackal,you can look it up
17-08-2019T07:03:29,CrimsonQuill,My legs cramp if i squat
17-08-2019T07:03:33,SniperJackal,oh
17-08-2019T07:03:35,CrimsonQuill,I have very long legs
17-08-2019T07:03:39,CrimsonQuill,That might be a factor
17-08-2019T07:04:04,SniperJackal,you can rest your behind on your feet
17-08-2019T07:04:37,CrimsonQuill,Ok....
17-08-2019T07:15:52,SniperJackal,I just wached the video
17-08-2019T07:16:06,SniperJackal,very interesting and actually makes alot of sense
17-08-2019T07:16:12,CrimsonQuill,It's both intriging and horrifying.
17-08-2019T07:16:20,SniperJackal,multiple cortanas
17-08-2019T07:16:36,CrimsonQuill,"Because if it turns out to be true, think about how many soldiers could have been thrown into the vaccumm."
17-08-2019T07:16:50,SniperJackal,yep
17-08-2019T07:17:01,CrimsonQuill,'We lost...lost everything. There's nothing left for us here. I don't even know where here is...'
17-08-2019T07:17:03,SniperJackal,but this is reminding me quite alot of halo 1
17-08-2019T07:17:09,SniperJackal,rescuing marines
17-08-2019T07:17:14,SniperJackal,2nd mission
17-08-2019T07:17:24,CrimsonQuill,I played that in SPV3
17-08-2019T07:17:33,CrimsonQuill,I liked that there was a base defence section
17-08-2019T07:17:43,SniperJackal,yeah those were the new sections
17-08-2019T07:17:52,SniperJackal,I like that addition
17-08-2019T07:18:27,CrimsonQuill,"One of the few objections I have in SPV3 is that some of the colours are...too bright, too intense."
17-08-2019T07:18:40,CrimsonQuill,But overall it's ok.
17-08-2019T07:18:43,SniperJackal,yeah and also some sections are too dark
17-08-2019T07:18:47,CrimsonQuill,True
17-08-2019T07:19:07,CrimsonQuill,Though some people seem to prefer them that way...I find it a bit odd.
17-08-2019T07:19:14,CrimsonQuill,The flood gave me the willies...
17-08-2019T07:19:18,SniperJackal,the second missions s grass textures and lighting were at least improved
17-08-2019T07:19:23,SniperJackal,in .2 version
17-08-2019T07:19:57,CrimsonQuill,Hmm
17-08-2019T07:20:25,SniperJackal,oh I remember the Jackal flood in the first version... They were screeching so damn loud
17-08-2019T07:20:35,SniperJackal,REEEE
17-08-2019T07:21:06,CrimsonQuill,"Oh Crumbs, that must've been the version I had."
17-08-2019T07:21:13,CrimsonQuill,"Because that happened,"
17-08-2019T07:21:15,CrimsonQuill,AAGH
17-08-2019T07:21:18,SniperJackal,looks like
17-08-2019T07:21:25,SniperJackal,the spv3.2 is the newest one
17-08-2019T07:21:54,SniperJackal,with the new lumoria missions and 3 new normal missions
17-08-2019T07:22:05,SniperJackal,including 2 playing as thel vadame
17-08-2019T07:22:11,CrimsonQuill,I see.
17-08-2019T07:22:24,CrimsonQuill,I watched a review of 'the commander'
17-08-2019T07:22:28,CrimsonQuill,It was interesting.
17-08-2019T07:22:36,SniperJackal,thought the missions are too dark
17-08-2019T07:22:41,SniperJackal,but that is being fixed
17-08-2019T07:22:51,CrimsonQuill,Good
17-08-2019T07:23:02,CrimsonQuill,I finally made that reference sheet
17-08-2019T07:23:10,CrimsonQuill,And I'm doodling a bit
17-08-2019T09:08:47,SniperJackal,watching some rvb
17-08-2019T09:09:06,SniperJackal,"I love the animations, and how Griff yeeted church"
17-08-2019T09:09:27,SniperJackal,and Tucker being smooth as always
17-08-2019T09:17:37,CrimsonQuill,:)
17-08-2019T09:17:47,CrimsonQuill,He is kinda like a football.
17-08-2019T09:18:39,SniperJackal,also tex is back
17-08-2019T09:19:06,CrimsonQuill,'Alright. Who's first?'
17-08-2019T09:19:16,CrimsonQuill,Mass Oh Crap for everyone
17-08-2019T09:19:42,SniperJackal,the fight animations were great
17-08-2019T09:20:00,SniperJackal,poor Griff got kicked in the nuts multiple times
17-08-2019T09:20:12,CrimsonQuill,'Why don't you just kill me?'
17-08-2019T09:20:24,CrimsonQuill,"Oh God, I Love that scene."
17-08-2019T09:22:57,SniperJackal,'No one s gonna buy you dinner'
17-08-2019T09:23:23,CrimsonQuill,XD

17-08-2019T09:26:20,SniperJackal,omg Tucker s lines are killing me
17-08-2019T09:26:42,CrimsonQuill,Yep

17-08-2019T09:27:16,SniperJackal,"'So shes either fully asleep or a full on bitch, sounds like my ex wife'"
17-08-2019T09:27:49,CrimsonQuill,I can't go for so many qutes
17-08-2019T09:27:56,CrimsonQuill,Because I haven't seen it in a bit

17-08-2019T11:55:45,AspiringNoodle,And last night the night guy was straight up missing
17-08-2019T11:56:03,AspiringNoodle,"Late, didn't call in.  So the assistant manager had to stay"
17-08-2019T11:57:09,AspiringNoodle,"Though, I think that's more of a faulty business model.  The gas station is open 24/7, but they only have a single employee present for night hours"

17-08-2019T14:59:35,InTheLionsDen,"What he posted yesterday: ""There won't be a poll to vote on suggestions, I'll just have them picked during the stream itself. Next week we'll do the Patreon poll like before."""
17-08-2019T14:59:49,Mippy,I'm hoping to fiish up a sketch today amd maybe ink it.
17-08-2019T14:59:53,TerraTheWizard,so it could be tom picks or tkpolls
17-08-2019T15:00:26,Mippy,"I assumed it was Tom Pick, but now I'm not sure"

17-08-2019T16:24:14,MarvTheHugPharaoh,same
17-08-2019T16:24:22,SniperJackal,@CrimsonQuill oh and this is probably dumb but is Irish its own language? I always thought the whole of the UK spoke English
17-08-2019T16:24:29,Almighty404,@Ordithus -tiplier ?
17-08-2019T16:24:34,SniperJackal,I probably sound like an idiot
17-08-2019T16:24:40,Mippy,Flora doing a little shimmy in her ribbons
17-08-2019T16:24:44,WereKeidran,there is an Irish language called Gaelic
17-08-2019T16:24:46,FloofyCat,Gaelic is
17-08-2019T16:24:49,AnuSekaniArt,Oh boy can't wait to get my computer built. My Chromebook can barely handle a stream XD
17-08-2019T16:24:53,SniperJackal,oooh
17-08-2019T16:24:53,FloofyCat,But people use English afaik
17-08-2019T16:25:04,FloofyCat,"Also, Ireland? UK? Not for much longer I bet!"
17-08-2019T16:25:10,InTheLionsDen,Wales has the Welsh language
17-08-2019T16:25:19,Ordithus,"Hmm one day I should have one of the main characters in a sketch suggestion.  Flora's cute, I'll try with her."
17-08-2019T16:25:19,ThingsAreMoving,welsh is weird
17-08-2019T16:25:26,Mippy,English is majority language
17-08-2019T16:25:28,CrimsonQuill,It's actually better to call it 'Gaeilge' as opposed to Gaeilic
17-08-2019T16:25:29,FloofyCat,Welsh is beautiful
17-08-2019T16:25:30,Sclimshady,Whales just humm at eachother
17-08-2019T16:25:34,CrimsonQuill,It is a branch of Gaeilic
17-08-2019T16:25:38,SniperJackal,Garlic sounds better
17-08-2019T16:25:40,FloofyCat,Welsh is just keyboard headbanging
17-08-2019T16:25:43,CrimsonQuill,But it's generally called 'Gaeilge'
17-08-2019T16:25:45,Rubbermatt,Cthulhu only knows what language Glaswegians speak
17-08-2019T16:25:52,SniperJackal,XD

17-08-2019T16:26:28,FloofyCat,Gaelic is also kind of old so people only use it to show off 99% of the time
17-08-2019T16:26:29,TeapotOfDoom,Nani?
17-08-2019T16:26:34,SniperJackal,I like Wales...Has good Rallies

17-08-2019T16:48:55,Ordithus,"If that actually were, I'd be more concerned"

17-08-2019T16:50:05,FloofyCat,It's a bit too far to the left anyway.
17-08-2019T16:50:11,CrimsonQuill,We never had cartoon Network

17-08-2019T19:49:15,unsteddyphoenix,"""A coyote has a narrow and pointed face with a small nose and tall, pointed ears. The gray wolf has a broad head with large nose and short, rounded ears."""

17-08-2019T19:50:13,Ordithus,Helluva story
17-08-2019T19:50:14,unsteddyphoenix,i guess the ears should be the main difference
17-08-2019T19:50:18,FenceEqualizer,It would be one of those rare case where an animal tries to adopt a human
17-08-2019T19:50:19,Mippy,I’m sure he would have been Floofy Doggo

17-08-2019T21:29:07,DarthKeidran,What sketch was after Mike getting a couple ladies?
17-08-2019T21:29:28,InTheLionsDen,Keith as the big spoon

17-08-2019T21:32:00,ProsePro7,Tom your not going to do a whole page this late are you?
17-08-2019T21:32:46,Katfeathers,I get the feeling that this was a one panal page
17-08-2019T21:32:56,DarthKeidran,@Ordithus Page 69. Drugged up Flora after nearly jumping Trace.
17-08-2019T21:33:08,Ordithus,"Yes, I know, but thank you anyways"
17-08-2019T21:34:08,DarthKeidran,@Katfeathers you would be correct. We’ll also get to see #TomsPizza Pizza Tom again.
17-08-2019T21:35:49,BigTiddiesDickFurry,FUcking my dog pener is so big right now dude like holy shit I think I'm going to commission some artwork of that animal crossings dog my dude!!!!!!!!

17-08-2019T21:36:12,DarthKeidran,FATALITY!
17-08-2019T21:36:24,Orthonox,... Okay.
17-08-2019T21:36:26,AspiringNoodle,"Also, restarted computer and strem still buffering"
17-08-2019T21:36:33,AspiringNoodle,Why does Picarto hate me? :ptv-whiny:
17-08-2019T21:36:36,RustyJack,Troll attack
17-08-2019T21:36:46,steelabjur,...Wow.
17-08-2019T21:37:10,DarthKeidran,"@AspiringNoodle more often than not, it hates me, whether on Windows, Mac, or Mobile"
17-08-2019T21:37:30,DarthKeidran,And regardless of location/network.
17-08-2019T21:38:25,DarthKeidran,Whoever does the bingo cards needs to add “The Almighty Ban Hammer” as a space.
17-08-2019T21:38:41,AspiringNoodle,I somehow got off shift early today
17-08-2019T21:38:48,AspiringNoodle,So I was excited to catch the end of the stream
17-08-2019T21:38:53,AspiringNoodle,Stupid buffering :c
17-08-2019T21:39:12,DarthKeidran,Lucky. I’m in the beginning of a 16 hour shift right now.
17-08-2019T21:39:32,Combak,RIP Darth.
17-08-2019T21:40:34,AspiringNoodle,switched from HLS to RTMP flash
17-08-2019T21:40:39,AspiringNoodle,Stream is flawless now <3
17-08-2019T21:41:05,SomeNiceUser,Hi Noodle!
17-08-2019T21:41:15,JoshErickson,He's drawing my suggestion!!!😁😁😁
17-08-2019T21:41:24,DarthKeidran,"Yep. My regular work schedule is 4 12’s On, 3 days off, 1 12, 1 8, and 1 12 On, 4 days off."
17-08-2019T21:41:40,SomeNiceUser,A great suggestion indeed Josh.
17-08-2019T21:41:46,AspiringNoodle,I'ms retail for now :P
17-08-2019T21:41:53,Combak,"Seems overly complex, but I can't talk too much."
17-08-2019T21:42:20,Combak,How'd you'd get a 16 hour shift though?
17-08-2019T21:42:28,InTheLionsDen,^
17-08-2019T21:42:43,DarthKeidran,It looks like @JoshErickson dropped off right as I was asking if it was his first.
17-08-2019T21:42:46,SomeNiceUser,16 hour shift? Damn Noob
17-08-2019T21:42:53,TheOtherEric,Anyone else see Floras left leg is a wee bit longer it seems
17-08-2019T21:43:00,SomeNiceUser,Noodle*
17-08-2019T21:43:26,DarthKeidran,I survive for 16 hours by loading up on Game Fuel and other Non-Coffee Non-Tea Caffienated Beverages.
17-08-2019T21:43:28,TheOtherEric,Specifically from hip to knee area
17-08-2019T21:43:42,DarthKeidran,Such is the life of a Correctional Officer.
17-08-2019T21:44:06,DarthKeidran,(Except for the majority of them who do drink coffee and tea.
17-08-2019T21:44:25,SomeNiceUser,The sketch is really starting to show.
17-08-2019T21:44:33,Katfeathers,still highly caffinated
17-08-2019T21:44:54,PurpleLemons,Catnap!
17-08-2019T21:45:01,DarthKeidran,"The next day always sucks though, because normally I can only get about 4 hours of sleep."
17-08-2019T21:45:08,Sclimshady,Hi Purp! o/
17-08-2019T21:46:10,Ordithus,ello Purp
17-08-2019T21:46:19,Ordithus,ouch Darth
17-08-2019T21:46:37,TheQuietHistoryGuy,yo
17-08-2019T21:46:43,DarthKeidran,"Also, correction from earlier. I’m working at a facility that’s testbedding 12 hour shifts (16 if you get hit with overtime) because the legislature didn’t want to increase wages to prevent staff from leaving."
17-08-2019T21:47:02,DarthKeidran,"Needless to say, it didn’t work."
17-08-2019T21:47:23,Ordithus,Oh what fun
17-08-2019T21:47:27,Katfeathers,brilliant /sarcasm
17-08-2019T21:47:42,ProsePro7,@DarthKeidran sounds like my job
17-08-2019T21:47:45,DarthKeidran,"They bumped up starting pay, but didn’t stop the 12 hr shifts."
17-08-2019T21:47:49,InTheLionsDen,And overtime is very likely?
17-08-2019T21:48:07,DarthKeidran,@ProsePro7 what’s your job?
17-08-2019T21:48:13,ProsePro7,Army
17-08-2019T21:48:24,Mippy,Fek....just realized a cape I drew on a guy makes no sense with his body position
17-08-2019T21:48:47,AspiringNoodle,#drawinglggic :P
17-08-2019T21:48:54,AspiringNoodle,#drawinglogic*
17-08-2019T21:49:10,DarthKeidran,Ooh. I can see that. The officer paired with me right now is military (reserve).
17-08-2019T21:49:47,Sclimshady,Reserve is fake military lol
17-08-2019T21:50:11,DarthKeidran,@Mippy I had the same problem with a Darth Vader t-shirt I’m designing.
17-08-2019T21:50:14,ProsePro7,Field exercises have 12 hour shifts and if you count to pre brief and the after brief to commanders and shift changes 16 hours is common
17-08-2019T21:51:30,DarthKeidran,@Sclimshady I’m gonna pretend I didn’t read that. XD they have to regularly go through training so if they’re needed they can perform in the field.
17-08-2019T21:52:10,Sclimshady,"I know they're good people,  gotta hate on the part timers though"
17-08-2019T21:52:14,ProsePro7,Some of them get deployed more than active too
17-08-2019T21:52:46,Mippy,I love my part timers...I can actually understand them.
17-08-2019T21:53:07,Ordithus,"Tom, Trace's ear doesn't look right to me.  I think it should be further back on the side of his head, laying more flat to the viewer."
17-08-2019T21:53:07,DarthKeidran,@ProsePro7 I feel for you. On average I get hit with 16s at least 2 times a week (at least 50% of my days).
17-08-2019T21:53:29,DarthKeidran,"Probably not as often as you… but, I feel for ya."
17-08-2019T21:54:43,superwolfart,hi

17-08-2019T21:58:24,DarthKeidran,"@superwolfart Don’t mine everyone. About an eighth of the time it can seem like everyone’s gotten drunk or something. XD heck, I don’t drink and I can come across like that."
17-08-2019T21:58:57,Mippy,I don’t know why that’s so funny to me :ctwokinds-NataniHAHA: super wolf fart
17-08-2019T21:59:06,Sclimshady,We're all just dumb

17-08-2019T22:02:55,DarthKeidran,I *came* up with that ages ago
17-08-2019T22:03:46,HeresyArtStream,Helloes! :cheresyartstream-SOBHeresy:

17-08-2019T22:04:28,Sclimshady,Hi Heresy o/
17-08-2019T22:06:00,DarthKeidran,"@Mippy That made me think, of Heresy kissed someone, Would you call it a Hershey kiss? #SometimesAutocorrectIsAwesome"
17-08-2019T22:08:08,DarthKeidran,So what were the second and fourth sketches?
17-08-2019T22:08:20,Mippy,square people with big looks of disappointment
17-08-2019T22:08:36,ProsePro7,Second was Flora Ribbons redux
17-08-2019T22:08:40,Combak,"Oh, hi Heresy!"
17-08-2019T22:09:00,ProsePro7,Third was Maren French resistance
17-08-2019T22:09:23,ProsePro7,And fourth I think was Trace teaching Rose how to use magic
17-08-2019T22:09:32,InTheLionsDen,Yes
17-08-2019T22:10:24,DarthKeidran,"That fourth one I caught a glimpse of. It was a bit of a sad, What things could have been, situation."
17-08-2019T22:10:32,SomeNiceUser,We got some good sketches this week.
17-08-2019T22:10:41,ProsePro7,Very good
17-08-2019T22:10:43,AspiringNoodle,I'll say
17-08-2019T22:10:58,AspiringNoodle,"Trace in the middle of the classic: ""IT'S NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE!"" trope :P"
17-08-2019T22:10:58,DarthKeidran,@SomeNiceUser but don’t we always?
17-08-2019T22:11:12,Ordithus,"Noodle that is the page, yes"
17-08-2019T22:11:19,unsteddyphoenix,no kat though :ctwokinds-katwet:
17-08-2019T22:11:23,SomeNiceUser,It’s a very fitting scene for page 69.
17-08-2019T22:11:27,ProsePro7,Tom ya gonna finish this one later?
17-08-2019T22:12:08,AspiringNoodle,The only way this page could be better is if Flora said something VERY suggestive that was VERY contradictory to Trace's claims :P
17-08-2019T22:12:21,AspiringNoodle,"But it's plenty funny as is, lol"
17-08-2019T22:12:22,DarthKeidran,"@unsteddyphoenix don’t worry, next week will be only Kat sketches."
17-08-2019T22:12:24,Orthonox,uh... I can explain!

17-08-2019T22:22:06,SomeNiceUser,I like the Rose sketch. How about you guys?
17-08-2019T22:22:29,Orthonox,I liked it as well.
17-08-2019T22:22:36,Ordithus,It's a good one
17-08-2019T22:22:41,unsteddyphoenix,I HATE IT
17-08-2019T22:22:44,Orthonox,It was somewhat wholesome.

17-08-2019T22:23:34,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-rainehappy:
17-08-2019T22:24:13,Ordithus,Maren's been getting some more attention lately.  Makes me happy
17-08-2019T22:24:23,Ordithus,Even if she's a cat most the time
17-08-2019T22:24:42,unsteddyphoenix,Cats are cute!!!
17-08-2019T22:24:58,SomeNiceUser,"I have so many ideas for suggestions that I would suggest myself, but I am saving currently."

17-08-2019T22:33:46,Dadrobit,Stream went well?
17-08-2019T22:33:47,RimaDraws,hi dadro
17-08-2019T22:35:35,SomeNiceUser,"It did Robit, it was satisfying to see the recap."
17-08-2019T22:35:47,SpazztasticKiwi,nope everything exploded and we lost Tom
17-08-2019T22:36:39,InTheLionsDen,:ctwokinds-KeithNeat:
17-08-2019T22:37:12,SomeNiceUser,No more woofs and miaow.
17-08-2019T22:37:21,AspiringNoodle,I'm just trying to finally get through this damned backlog
17-08-2019T22:37:36,AspiringNoodle,"Slow upload day, so not a lot of new videos to go through :D"
17-08-2019T22:37:52,SomeNiceUser,"Every day, the backlog thickens."
17-08-2019T22:38:13,Dadrobit,New IEMs came in the mail and took the puppy to the vet. It was a good day.
17-08-2019T22:38:15,AspiringNoodle,"I'm getting better, tbh :P"
17-08-2019T22:38:30,AspiringNoodle,I'm probably just gonna pull the trigger and sub to a few more channels I watch regularly
17-08-2019T22:39:32,SomeNiceUser,"I give very small portions of ice cream to my dog, he likes it. And it’s necessary to give him that."
17-08-2019T22:40:12,Dadrobit,Turns out the puppy is about 3 months. Got some recommendations to help him with his skin. Had lots of fleas when I first got him and his skin is still super itchy.
17-08-2019T22:40:22,SomeNiceUser,Since he’s taking some medication.
17-08-2019T22:40:23,Ordithus,poor guy
17-08-2019T22:41:07,SomeNiceUser,"Mine has seizures once every 2-3 weeks, which is very sad to watch."
17-08-2019T22:41:31,SomeNiceUser,At least he’s getting better.
17-08-2019T22:41:58,Dadrobit,D:
17-08-2019T22:42:15,Dadrobit,:(
17-08-2019T22:43:00,AspiringNoodle,...I WANNA COMFORT THE LIL' PUPPER :ptv-whiny:
17-08-2019T22:43:51,AspiringNoodle,"Also, I think I know what channels I might axe from my subscriptions, lol"
17-08-2019T22:43:59,SomeNiceUser,"Pupper likes his cream, expects it every night."
17-08-2019T22:44:02,AspiringNoodle,MatPat's getting a smidge too cringe for my tastes
17-08-2019T22:44:06,AspiringNoodle,DO IT
17-08-2019T22:44:07,AspiringNoodle,JUST
17-08-2019T22:44:11,AspiringNoodle,DO IT!
17-08-2019T22:44:48,SomeNiceUser,"He did get his share, he sleeping currently."
17-08-2019T22:44:58,AspiringNoodle,Awwww~
17-08-2019T22:45:31,SpazztasticKiwi,fun fact pupper means tit in Norwegian Bokmål
17-08-2019T22:46:00,Ordithus,pupper hehe
17-08-2019T22:46:06,AspiringNoodle,Good thing I like puppers

17-08-2019T22:46:28,InTheLionsDen,He said puppers. He He He
17-08-2019T22:46:43,SomeNiceUser,"The good news is that he’s getting less frequent seizures, he’s currently getting one two months now."
17-08-2019T22:48:29,SpazztasticKiwi,should’ve never told you children
17-08-2019T22:48:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Fruits Basket 20 is up!
17-08-2019T22:48:53,SomeNiceUser,Nice.
17-08-2019T22:48:54,AspiringNoodle,If a pupper has puppers
17-08-2019T22:49:02,AspiringNoodle,Is it adorable or a sin against Nature itself?
17-08-2019T22:49:14,SomeNiceUser,Does it make puppets?
17-08-2019T22:49:17,AspiringNoodle,THESE ARE THE QUESTIONS WE MUST KNOW THE ANSWER TO!
17-08-2019T22:49:56,RimaDraws,god i am not ready for thursday
17-08-2019T22:50:17,SomeNiceUser,Nobody is.

17-08-2019T22:51:11,RimaDraws,its when i start the continuation of my degree for my bachelors
17-08-2019T22:51:51,AspiringNoodle,i wish i was still in college
17-08-2019T22:51:55,AspiringNoodle,"Talk about easy street, lol"
17-08-2019T22:52:13,AspiringNoodle,"Yeah, I didn't get paid, but the assignments were interesting, at least"
17-08-2019T22:52:31,RimaDraws,its not really easy street for me. i work as well
17-08-2019T22:52:33,Ordithus,"I am glad to be done with college.  No homework, get paid"
17-08-2019T22:52:58,SomeNiceUser,"I’m looking forward for college, when I’m prepared to go."
17-08-2019T22:53:01,RimaDraws,i am working on getting up in seniority to get hired on full time at the job i want most
17-08-2019T22:53:28,SpazztasticKiwi,🛌
17-08-2019T22:53:36,Ordithus,Night Kiwi
17-08-2019T22:53:38,SpazztasticKiwi,nite Tom
17-08-2019T22:53:38,SomeNiceUser,Night Kiwi.
17-08-2019T22:53:49,Dadrobit,"Class starts for me tomorrow. Should be super easy for me I think. Communications, and History of American Jazz. Both online."
17-08-2019T22:54:06,SomeNiceUser,“You like jazz?”
17-08-2019T22:54:25,RimaDraws,you starting college dadro?
17-08-2019T22:55:13,AspiringNoodle,"At this point, I have my degree, I have the computer parts, I have the interest in art"
17-08-2019T22:55:22,AspiringNoodle,I could get a decent job and pursue just about anything
17-08-2019T22:55:35,AspiringNoodle,"Also, screw AAA, lol"
17-08-2019T22:55:48,SomeNiceUser,You are set to do anything now.
17-08-2019T22:55:58,AspiringNoodle,"That place is a giant cess pit, and if I make a game, it'll be indie / stylized"
17-08-2019T22:56:12,SomeNiceUser,Good choice Noodle.
17-08-2019T22:56:36,AspiringNoodle,"Well, what sane person would want to pull months-long 80 - 100 work weeks?"
17-08-2019T22:57:30,Dadrobit,"More like finishing, rima. This semester and the next should be all I need to get my degree finalized."
17-08-2019T22:57:43,Ordithus,noice
17-08-2019T22:58:11,Dadrobit,"Already got my CCL is audio production technologies, now I'm just taking the boring stuff like humanities for the official degree."
17-08-2019T22:58:14,Ordithus,"My brother must be getting close to his degree, he's been working on it for years"
17-08-2019T22:58:25,Dadrobit,CCL in*
17-08-2019T22:58:45,SomeNiceUser,"I was thinking on going to get Game development in college, but people around me is very concerned"
17-08-2019T22:59:12,SomeNiceUser,5% passing rate for students.
17-08-2019T22:59:49,Dadrobit,My first bachelors was supposed to be in game development. Even had a job lined up for me at a local studio. Dropped out after the first year...
17-08-2019T22:59:49,AspiringNoodle,Game development is also a dead-end degree
17-08-2019T23:00:11,AspiringNoodle,"And let me guess Dad, they were instilling the crunch culture into you?"
17-08-2019T23:01:10,Dadrobit,"No, not at all. It was a very hippy kind of atmosphere. Half the desks were empty seats because folks did their work and just left when they were done."
17-08-2019T23:01:15,SomeNiceUser,What would be great for tech savvy people in college?
17-08-2019T23:01:27,Sclimshady,"Finished my howework,  thought it was due at midnight, it was actually due at 9.  so right now"
17-08-2019T23:01:33,AspiringNoodle,Computer science and or it's various concentrations
17-08-2019T23:01:36,AspiringNoodle,Software engineer
17-08-2019T23:01:39,AspiringNoodle,IT
17-08-2019T23:01:52,Ordithus,Engineering in general
17-08-2019T23:01:56,Dadrobit,I had made some connections with them after I won a contest for independent game development.
17-08-2019T23:02:09,Sclimshady,Engineers make bank and will always be needed
17-08-2019T23:02:26,Dadrobit,"They just wanted me to get the degree and I was in. Alas, I fucked up."
17-08-2019T23:02:35,SomeNiceUser,Seems like a good list for possible college choices.
17-08-2019T23:02:48,AspiringNoodle,Most of AAA is rotten to the core
17-08-2019T23:03:23,Dadrobit,"Some of the big ones, sure."
17-08-2019T23:03:55,AspiringNoodle,Anything under EA is officially a lost cause
17-08-2019T23:04:03,SomeNiceUser,Yup.
17-08-2019T23:04:10,AspiringNoodle,Ubisoft is somewhere in Limbo
17-08-2019T23:04:25,AspiringNoodle,They're more known for their facepalm worth bugs than they are egregious microtransactions
17-08-2019T23:04:51,SomeNiceUser,Ubisoft glitches.
17-08-2019T23:04:53,AspiringNoodle,Activision-Blizzard... total writeoff.  Blizzard is barreling towards it too
17-08-2019T23:05:18,Dadrobit,"Ubisoft has a few bad bugs here and there, but if you're going to hate on a company for bugs, go after Bethesda."
17-08-2019T23:05:26,AspiringNoodle,Don't have to
17-08-2019T23:05:29,AspiringNoodle,"They've gone EA, lmao"
17-08-2019T23:05:47,Ordithus,The bugs are part of the charm in games like Skyrim or Fallout
17-08-2019T23:06:27,Ordithus,"""Here, let me set this plate gently upon this table.  Whoops it rocketed off and killed three NPCs"""
17-08-2019T23:06:38,SomeNiceUser,I’m just waiting for ESVI for the final verdict on Bethesda.
17-08-2019T23:06:40,Dadrobit,Oblivion was charming. Skyrim was unplayable at launch.
17-08-2019T23:07:03,AspiringNoodle,"Right now, I only have 4 AAA developers worth my admiration"
17-08-2019T23:07:13,AspiringNoodle,And one arguably isn't AAA
17-08-2019T23:07:31,AspiringNoodle,"Bungie, CD Projekt Red, the developers of Warframe, and Wargaming.net"
17-08-2019T23:08:09,Sclimshady,"Bungie has some flaws, Like full price expansions :ctwokinds-flomad:"
17-08-2019T23:08:20,Dadrobit,"Literally unplayable. The PS3 version had ""Rimlag"" which was a memory leak that slowly corrupted your file and made the game lag to the point of being unplayable. And when they fixed it, the old save files were fucked, they couldn't move them forward."
17-08-2019T23:08:26,AspiringNoodle,"Respawn used to be on my list... but 2 of their staff have proven to be real ass-hats, and it has cast the rest of the company into doubt."
17-08-2019T23:08:46,Ordithus,dayum.  The PC version wasn't quite so bad
17-08-2019T23:08:56,AspiringNoodle,It was a PS3 exclusive bug
17-08-2019T23:09:02,SomeNiceUser,I lost interest after a bunch of full price expansions during a empty wallet.
17-08-2019T23:09:04,Dadrobit,"Honestly, as far as I'm concerned, ESVI is already a lost cause to me."
17-08-2019T23:09:05,AspiringNoodle,"Because nobody knows wtf Sony was thinking with that console, lol"
17-08-2019T23:09:32,AspiringNoodle,"Dad, if you paid attention to Fallout 76, you'd have written it off months ago for sure, lol"
17-08-2019T23:10:04,Dadrobit,I did and ESVI has been on my shit-list. This isn't my first mention.
17-08-2019T23:10:28,SomeNiceUser,"I was naive with Fallout 76, not gonna make the same mistake again."
17-08-2019T23:10:46,AspiringNoodle,So yeah... there are very few AAA developers I'd be willing to work for
17-08-2019T23:11:05,AspiringNoodle,Because they're either going to abuse the ever living shit out of their developers
17-08-2019T23:11:11,AspiringNoodle,Or abuse the ever living shit out of their customers
17-08-2019T23:11:22,Dadrobit,"Which reminds me, No Man's Sky just had an update that added VR support, need to check that out."
17-08-2019T23:11:34,AspiringNoodle,"Basically, it's indie or bust, lol"
17-08-2019T23:11:37,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-RainezZz: goodnight!
17-08-2019T23:11:40,Dadrobit,o/ Ord
17-08-2019T23:11:45,SomeNiceUser,Night Ord.
17-08-2019T23:11:46,Sclimshady,Night Ord
17-08-2019T23:11:55,AspiringNoodle,And I doubt an indie studio would pick up some random college student with no game development experience
17-08-2019T23:12:45,Dadrobit,That's why you build a portfolio of work WHILE you're in college yo. That's college 101
17-08-2019T23:13:45,AspiringNoodle,That's also the problem with work 101?
17-08-2019T23:14:09,SomeNiceUser,Get lots of contacts during college as a measure for lack of work.
17-08-2019T23:14:13,AspiringNoodle,"Over time, the amount of ""experience"" needed to even get a starting level position seems to keep crawling higher and higher"
17-08-2019T23:14:26,AspiringNoodle,"Before you know it, you'll need to start getting experience before you even start your degree :/"
17-08-2019T23:14:53,SomeNiceUser,Like that’s possible if this keeps up.
17-08-2019T23:15:39,Dadrobit,"Yeah, making connections is huge. I'm still in contact with my old professors and some of the students that were legitimately focused on the field."
17-08-2019T23:16:27,Dadrobit,Super helpful to have people you can call in a pinch and ask questions and get reliable answers instead of just Googling it.
17-08-2019T23:16:42,Dadrobit,"Also, good for helping move couches."
17-08-2019T23:16:58,AspiringNoodle,"Well, for now, I'll just take it one step at a time"
17-08-2019T23:17:17,AspiringNoodle,Gotta build the new computer.  Gotta start practicing art.  Get a non-retail job
17-08-2019T23:17:34,AspiringNoodle,See if those skillshare websites are any good c:
17-08-2019T23:17:59,SomeNiceUser,Good luck on that Noodle.
17-08-2019T23:18:31,Dadrobit,I do kinda miss game development. I was super big into making my own stuff in Unreal and making custom games in the Star Craft Brood War Editor when I was in junior high/high school.
17-08-2019T23:19:31,AspiringNoodle,"I have a few indy games in my steam library, stuff that's really story focused"
17-08-2019T23:20:17,AspiringNoodle,It'd be interesting to make a platformer / Metroidvania that tells a deep story
17-08-2019T23:20:23,SomeNiceUser,"I would love to make a game, still do."
17-08-2019T23:20:46,RimaDraws,well guys it was lovely talking to you but i must sleep now for work. night peeps! <3
17-08-2019T23:20:51,SomeNiceUser,I had that idea in mind Noodle.
17-08-2019T23:20:52,Dadrobit,o/ Rima
17-08-2019T23:20:58,SomeNiceUser,Night Rima.
17-08-2019T23:21:01,RimaDraws,ni ni <3 <3 o/
17-08-2019T23:21:04,Sclimshady,Night Rima o/
17-08-2019T23:21:16,AspiringNoodle,I'm tired... but it's an hour too early ._.
17-08-2019T23:21:29,AspiringNoodle,So I shall sleep vicariously through you :ptv-hearts:
17-08-2019T23:23:43,Dadrobit,I used to practice by figuring out how to make other games I played inside the Brood War editor. That thing was robust as al get out when you got into its depths.
17-08-2019T23:23:45,SomeNiceUser,I had the idea of using The loading through place like The legend of Zelda Oracle of seasons
17-08-2019T23:24:26,SomeNiceUser,Also like the Metroid games too.
17-08-2019T23:25:25,Dadrobit,Probably my best one that I recall was making Metal Gear Solid in it. It was some great practice having to figure out how to force the game to do what I needed it to do. Took weeks of skipping homework to finish it.
17-08-2019T23:26:09,SomeNiceUser,That’s some dedication Robit.
17-08-2019T23:27:34,Dadrobit,"One that I always wanted to finish was Final Fantasy Tactics. But that project got way too huge. Was pretty proud of what I made though. The game had multiple instances for the main map and had a pseudo random ""encounter rate"" for walking a marine through"
17-08-2019T23:28:41,Dadrobit,"the ""map"" that would then send the player to a separate instance for the battle areas where the party could be formed and got to battle. Even had stat increases for successful battles that made the characters level up."
17-08-2019T23:29:03,AspiringNoodle,Pretty cool
17-08-2019T23:29:17,Dadrobit,"So the core of the game was kind of there, but the overall scale of FFT was just too damn huge to ever finish inside of the editor."
17-08-2019T23:31:22,Dadrobit,"Heh, I have half a mind to download brood war again and see what I've forgotten."
17-08-2019T23:32:25,SomeNiceUser,Don’t push yourself too hard.
17-08-2019T23:33:19,Dadrobit,"Me, naw, just idle curiosity. I finally figured out the whole ""healthy work ethic"" a few years ago."
17-08-2019T23:34:15,SomeNiceUser,That is a thing that some companies need to work on though.
17-08-2019T23:34:33,AspiringNoodle,Indeed
17-08-2019T23:34:50,AspiringNoodle,"All I really know at the moment is, I want to tell stories / make people feel something"
17-08-2019T23:35:12,AspiringNoodle,"Not, ""I want to run myself into the ground as part of a giant, unsustainable money-making machine that doesn't give two-shits about its workers"""
17-08-2019T23:36:09,SomeNiceUser,I want to tell a story on how people are pushing people too hard and expect
17-08-2019T23:36:29,SomeNiceUser,Them to do stuff way out of their caliber.
17-08-2019T23:36:51,SomeNiceUser,Or something like that.
17-08-2019T23:40:19,SomeNiceUser,What about you guys.
17-08-2019T23:40:24,SomeNiceUser,?
17-08-2019T23:41:01,AspiringNoodle,I'm not sure
17-08-2019T23:41:21,AspiringNoodle,"During one of Chu's streams, I pulled out a backstory for a D&D character out my bum"
17-08-2019T23:41:39,AspiringNoodle,Rogue / Thief who doesn't like to kill :P
17-08-2019T23:42:39,AspiringNoodle,Maybe a story about living up to expectations of society?
17-08-2019T23:42:45,AspiringNoodle,Or lacking confidence in one's self
17-08-2019T23:43:18,AspiringNoodle,Fighting that little inner voice that looks at highly successful people and beats you down every chance it gets
17-08-2019T23:43:37,SomeNiceUser,A story on living up to expectations of society with uncontrollable power.
17-08-2019T23:43:49,Dadrobit,"I mean, I know it's cliche, but if you want to go do something really good, you first gotta go do a bunch of shitty work ya know? Practicing being perfect doesn't work when you're learning the first few hundred hours. Gotta have perfect practice instead."
17-08-2019T23:44:57,SomeNiceUser,You are right about that.
17-08-2019T23:45:04,Dadrobit,"Make a bunch of shitty games and stories. If you focus on making a masterpiece first, you'll never be happy with it and that'll be more degrading than anything else."
17-08-2019T23:45:18,SomeNiceUser,But I have a idea of what to do.
17-08-2019T23:45:33,AspiringNoodle,Dad being the literal dad and bringing sage advice~
17-08-2019T23:46:07,Dadrobit,more sagely
17-08-2019T23:46:13,Dadrobit,Nods*
17-08-2019T23:46:34,SomeNiceUser,"Make a script (I have no clue where to start), correct some mistakes and cover up plot holes and the, refining the story."
17-08-2019T23:49:28,Dadrobit,That's why you acknowledge that they're going to be shitty stories from the start. Initial practice is mostly just to get you used to actually practicing instead of sitting around thinking of practicing.
17-08-2019T23:51:14,Dadrobit,"""refining"" the story isn't what you need to get good at. Putting the words on the paper is."
17-08-2019T23:51:44,SomeNiceUser,"I’ve done two stories (like you said, it turned into a pile of burning trash), but I’m pushing words on a paper though."
17-08-2019T23:52:22,SomeNiceUser,First one advanced too fast for my liking.
17-08-2019T23:52:33,Dadrobit,"Cool, now do it again literally a hundred times."
17-08-2019T23:53:03,SomeNiceUser,Second one went and didn’t make sense.
17-08-2019T23:54:06,SomeNiceUser,"Actually I gave up on that one, I just hit a brick wall."
17-08-2019T23:54:51,SomeNiceUser,"But you are right Robit, I need to practice."
17-08-2019T23:55:07,Dadrobit,Giving up on a project is totally fine. Just gotta move on to the next.
17-08-2019T23:55:41,Dadrobit,"Goodness knows I have 20 or 30 sound design projects that are all on the ""back burner""."
17-08-2019T23:57:10,SomeNiceUser,":ptv-sleepy:I’m off to sleep, thank you for your wisdom Dadrobit."
17-08-2019T23:57:35,Dadrobit,o/ have good sleeps. I gotta go start my homework for my classes tomorrow.
