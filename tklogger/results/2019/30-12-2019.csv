30-12-2019T15:56:10,SpazztasticKiwi,maybe we’ll finally see Flora’s birth
30-12-2019T15:56:48,CrimsonQuill,Evening all
30-12-2019T15:56:51,CrimsonQuill,:ptv-greetings:
30-12-2019T15:58:47,CrimsonQuill,Everyone looking forward to the new year?

30-12-2019T16:23:31,AspiringNoodle,"That face needs an emote, asap"
30-12-2019T16:23:48,CrimsonQuill,"Which face? Also, hello Aspiring"
30-12-2019T16:24:17,AspiringNoodle,Flora's
30-12-2019T16:24:43,AspiringNoodle,"Also, SERIOUSLY?  Turns out that work tried calling me not only yesterday, but today"
30-12-2019T16:25:10,AspiringNoodle,New Year's Resolution: Find a new job. Lol
30-12-2019T16:25:15,CrimsonQuill,Good idea
30-12-2019T16:25:22,CrimsonQuill,Yesterday I was wrecked after work
30-12-2019T16:25:44,CrimsonQuill,One of the dishwashing machines I need to use stopped working in the middle of the after-lunch plate rush
30-12-2019T16:25:51,AspiringNoodle,"I'm already scheduled for 5 days this week.  It was originally 33.5 hours but after staying late / coming in early, it'll be 35 min after the next two days"
30-12-2019T16:26:05,CrimsonQuill,Ouch.
30-12-2019T16:26:12,AspiringNoodle,And I need to do some work for my other job today
30-12-2019T16:26:22,CrimsonQuill,I often stay in after I'm meant to finish up myself.
30-12-2019T16:26:31,CrimsonQuill,There's always a little bit left to do.
30-12-2019T16:26:37,AspiringNoodle,So I effectively work 6 days this week.  And I go back to the first job for 4 days in a row after this
30-12-2019T16:26:52,CrimsonQuill,"So, very busy schedule for you."
30-12-2019T16:26:59,CrimsonQuill,That stinks...
30-12-2019T16:27:02,AspiringNoodle,More like they need to do their f*cking jobs and hire more people
30-12-2019T16:27:15,CrimsonQuill,I'd say so.
30-12-2019T16:27:16,AspiringNoodle,I saw a hiring sign by the freezers but NOT on the front door
30-12-2019T16:27:29,CrimsonQuill,Umm...failed a spot check there.
30-12-2019T16:27:41,CrimsonQuill,"They should have it on the door definitely,"
30-12-2019T16:27:45,AspiringNoodle,We are guaranteed going to be losing 1 employee in the next few months
30-12-2019T16:27:56,CrimsonQuill,Job that bad?
30-12-2019T16:28:05,AspiringNoodle,"She's going to the community college for her CNA, and will be applying to a nursing home mid semester"
30-12-2019T16:28:17,CrimsonQuill,I'm working in a nursing home myself.
30-12-2019T16:28:24,CrimsonQuill,Kitchen catering.
30-12-2019T16:28:29,AspiringNoodle,"That home will have a max pay rate of $18.75 an hour, and I think the min is $12.5"
30-12-2019T16:28:38,CrimsonQuill,Wow. That's good.
30-12-2019T16:28:44,AspiringNoodle,Sure as hell beats the $9.5 here
30-12-2019T16:28:55,CrimsonQuill,I get about €10 an hour for 8 hour shifts
30-12-2019T16:29:03,CrimsonQuill,But double pay on Sundays
30-12-2019T16:29:07,AspiringNoodle,We have another employee a year younger than me who just got his degree in computer science (just like me :D)
30-12-2019T16:29:08,CrimsonQuill,Which I sometimes work
30-12-2019T16:29:13,CrimsonQuill,Neat!
30-12-2019T16:29:23,AspiringNoodle,"And while his availability is opened up, he does not want to work more than 24 hours a week"
30-12-2019T16:29:29,CrimsonQuill,I see.
30-12-2019T16:29:31,AspiringNoodle,"You know, job search."
30-12-2019T16:29:53,AspiringNoodle,"Then there's me.  I have 2 jobs, 1 I enjoy more than the other, and I'm just WAITING for an excuse to drop hours"
30-12-2019T16:30:00,CrimsonQuill,"Well, I've worked Monday and today, work again tomorrow, two days off, then I'm on Saturday and Sunday."
30-12-2019T16:30:08,CrimsonQuill,And on Monday next is my exam
30-12-2019T16:30:23,CrimsonQuill,Into college at 9:00am sharp.
30-12-2019T16:30:26,CrimsonQuill,Books ready
30-12-2019T16:30:30,CrimsonQuill,To own that paper
30-12-2019T16:30:46,CrimsonQuill,It's been quite a humbling experience.
30-12-2019T16:31:01,AspiringNoodle,Part of the reason I want to cut hours is so that I can hone my programming / art skills.  Maybe not the former P
30-12-2019T16:31:04,AspiringNoodle,:P*
30-12-2019T16:31:21,CrimsonQuill,I'd have thought that IT programmers are in demand.
30-12-2019T16:31:39,AspiringNoodle,I wanted to develop video games but noped out of that idea very quickly
30-12-2019T16:31:56,CrimsonQuill,"Still, there could be work as an IT specialist"
30-12-2019T16:32:04,CrimsonQuill,Fixing computers and whatnot
30-12-2019T16:32:16,CrimsonQuill,I don't know...
30-12-2019T16:32:55,AspiringNoodle,"Honestly, the gas station is ridiculous"
30-12-2019T16:33:08,CrimsonQuill,I'm not that good at coding to be honest. (Although I need to become fairly good ASAP if i want to work with Geographic Information Sciences and the Surveying Programs and instruments)
30-12-2019T16:33:22,AspiringNoodle,We have maybe 1 part timer working below 20 hours.  And I think it's 16.
30-12-2019T16:33:47,AspiringNoodle,And corporate keeps wanting to cut hours so stuff keeps piling up
30-12-2019T16:33:50,CrimsonQuill,Is there a lot of traffic coming through there?
30-12-2019T16:33:59,AspiringNoodle,A decent amount.  But you know corporate
30-12-2019T16:34:11,AspiringNoodle,"Know fuck-all about how stores actually run, and only care about their precious numbers"
30-12-2019T16:34:12,CrimsonQuill,"Yeah...profit first, people later"
30-12-2019T16:34:22,CrimsonQuill,"Idiotic, to say the least"
30-12-2019T16:34:34,CrimsonQuill,If they paid more attention to people than numbers...
30-12-2019T16:34:38,AspiringNoodle,"""Your store isn't getting enough sales, we need you to cut 100 hours off a week"""
30-12-2019T16:34:49,AspiringNoodle,"""But... we need those hours to get vital maintenance tasks done-"""
30-12-2019T16:34:58,AspiringNoodle,"""NO. LOW SALES. CUT HOURS."""
30-12-2019T16:35:19,CrimsonQuill,"Not only would there be more employee retention, because people would actually want to stay in the jobs because they were being treated properly..."
30-12-2019T16:35:33,CrimsonQuill,"In the end they could end up making a steadier, more sustainable income."
30-12-2019T16:35:38,CrimsonQuill,It's kind of the same here.
30-12-2019T16:35:43,AspiringNoodle,I'm just waiting for UBI to become implemented
30-12-2019T16:35:56,CrimsonQuill,Nurses from hospitals are all going to the UK because in Ireland it's just not good enough.
30-12-2019T16:36:09,AspiringNoodle,"Not a ridiculous version, but what's known as ""Minimum Basic Income"".  AKA, enough money to stay above the poverty line"
30-12-2019T16:36:15,CrimsonQuill,I see
30-12-2019T16:36:18,CrimsonQuill,Well
30-12-2019T16:36:38,CrimsonQuill,"I'll just say, best of luck with the jobhunt"
30-12-2019T16:36:49,AspiringNoodle,Want to know why I'm waiting for UBI? :P
30-12-2019T16:36:59,AspiringNoodle,"There's many reasons, but one in particular I find very appealing"
30-12-2019T16:37:07,CrimsonQuill,"To search for a better job, and make more art?"
30-12-2019T16:37:26,AspiringNoodle,"The overall improvement of ""minimum wage"" jobs"
30-12-2019T16:37:41,CrimsonQuill,"Oh, are they getting better?"
30-12-2019T16:37:57,AspiringNoodle,"Quite literally, if people are making enough money to LIVE without needing a job, jobs that are shitty and / or treat their employees like shit / replaceable aren't going to survive"
30-12-2019T16:38:12,CrimsonQuill,I think I see.
30-12-2019T16:38:15,AspiringNoodle,Because they won't NEED to keep those jobs for any reason other than the extra money
30-12-2019T16:38:41,CrimsonQuill,"There are some jobs that are minimum wage, but that are absolutely vital to the running of society."
30-12-2019T16:38:49,CrimsonQuill,I assume wages for those will have to go up.
30-12-2019T16:39:01,CrimsonQuill,Stuff like council work and street cleaning.
30-12-2019T16:39:12,CrimsonQuill,minor repairs
30-12-2019T16:39:14,CrimsonQuill,Cleaners
30-12-2019T16:39:16,CrimsonQuill,Etc
30-12-2019T16:39:38,AspiringNoodle,"The problem with most retail positions is that corporate views labor as a cost, and not an investment"
30-12-2019T16:39:46,CrimsonQuill,Stupid idea.
30-12-2019T16:39:48,AspiringNoodle,So they want to get the maximum value out of that labor that they can
30-12-2019T16:40:00,CrimsonQuill,"Without labour, the flipping shops wouldn't really run."
30-12-2019T16:40:03,AspiringNoodle,"If sales go down, they will cut hours to save their profits / the bottom line"
30-12-2019T16:40:13,CrimsonQuill,fumes
30-12-2019T16:40:22,AspiringNoodle,"Where are you from, again?"
30-12-2019T16:40:29,CrimsonQuill,British Isles
30-12-2019T16:40:33,CrimsonQuill,Half English Half Irish
30-12-2019T16:40:41,AspiringNoodle,"Okay, so here in the US we have a home improvement store called Home Depot"
30-12-2019T16:40:49,CrimsonQuill,Ok
30-12-2019T16:41:03,AspiringNoodle,"For the longest time, the company was highly regarded because of its well treated and knowledgable sales staff"
30-12-2019T16:41:16,CrimsonQuill,"Uh-oh, I see where this is going."
30-12-2019T16:41:16,AspiringNoodle,"Decent pay, decent benefits, actually knew stuff about home improvement / construction"
30-12-2019T16:41:34,AspiringNoodle,"Then in the late 90's / early 2000's, they got a new CEO"
30-12-2019T16:41:36,CrimsonQuill,"Corporate higher ups started looking for more profit, didn't they?"
30-12-2019T16:41:40,AspiringNoodle,Bingo
30-12-2019T16:41:59,CrimsonQuill,"And because they cut corners, overall quality went down?"
30-12-2019T16:42:06,AspiringNoodle,He started eliminating full-time positions and replacing them with more part timers.  Saved the company a lot of money on benefits
30-12-2019T16:42:18,AspiringNoodle,"But like you said, their legendary customer service no longer existed"
30-12-2019T16:42:34,CrimsonQuill,It just seems so counter-intuitive to me!
30-12-2019T16:42:44,AspiringNoodle,"Their knowledgable full-time staff were replaced with part-timers to save money on benefits, and the shopping experience tanked"
30-12-2019T16:42:51,CrimsonQuill,"It's like Mr Kornada's robo-lobotomization plot in Freefall.,"
30-12-2019T16:43:07,AspiringNoodle,Incompetency is a requirement to climb the corporate ladder
30-12-2019T16:43:13,CrimsonQuill,All short term gain comes at expense of total economic collapse
30-12-2019T16:43:24,AspiringNoodle,That's the entire problem!
30-12-2019T16:43:26,CrimsonQuill,"Blegh, I really hope that the trend is broken."
30-12-2019T16:43:33,AspiringNoodle,All these companies want their short-term numbers to look good
30-12-2019T16:44:00,AspiringNoodle,The AAA games industry is on the verge of another collapse because they're chasing this exact trend
30-12-2019T16:44:08,CrimsonQuill,EA comes to mind
30-12-2019T16:44:12,AspiringNoodle,"And to be honest, investors are just as much to blame, as well as our legal system"
30-12-2019T16:44:35,AspiringNoodle,"You see, the funny thing is that publicly traded companies are REQUIRED to make money for their investors"
30-12-2019T16:44:40,CrimsonQuill,It's just ridiculous.
30-12-2019T16:44:47,AspiringNoodle,And investors want sustained indefinite growth
30-12-2019T16:44:57,CrimsonQuill,...which is impossible.
30-12-2019T16:45:10,AspiringNoodle,"Yup, but if you DON'T play the game, they can sue the company for not fulfilling its duty"
30-12-2019T16:45:11,CrimsonQuill,"Because somewhere, things will either plateau or go down."
30-12-2019T16:45:25,CrimsonQuill,"And what, pray, would that 'duty' be?"
30-12-2019T16:45:31,AspiringNoodle,To make them an ROI
30-12-2019T16:45:56,AspiringNoodle,"So, it's a three-fold problem that lies almost entirely with the way public trading is setup"
30-12-2019T16:46:07,CrimsonQuill,Sooner or later it's going to crash down again.
30-12-2019T16:46:15,AspiringNoodle,We're already heading that way
30-12-2019T16:46:15,CrimsonQuill,And who's going to feel the pinch?
30-12-2019T16:46:18,CrimsonQuill,Us.
30-12-2019T16:46:38,AspiringNoodle,"Oh yeah, no.  If we have ANOTHER taxpayer bailout of huge companies, we might have literal civil war, lol"
30-12-2019T16:46:46,CrimsonQuill,To quote Mr Pump the Golem from Terry Pratchett's 'Going Postal'...
30-12-2019T16:47:00,CrimsonQuill,"""When the banks break, it is seldom the bankers who go hungry"""
30-12-2019T16:47:13,AspiringNoodle,These companies keep running themselves into the ground and expect US to bail them out.  Meanwhile the people at the very top pocketing all the profits don't pay a damn thing.
30-12-2019T16:47:20,CrimsonQuill,Here's to the trend breaking over the decade.
30-12-2019T16:47:33,CrimsonQuill,To the higher-ups being replaced by those with common sense.
30-12-2019T16:47:44,CrimsonQuill,And to those who look past the short-term profit.
30-12-2019T16:47:49,CrimsonQuill,"We can hope, and vote."
30-12-2019T16:47:57,AspiringNoodle,Here's what will break the trend
30-12-2019T16:48:05,AspiringNoodle,Private companies who DON'T play the stock market game
30-12-2019T16:48:12,CrimsonQuill,"True, true."
30-12-2019T16:48:21,CrimsonQuill,"There are plenty of those on the rise, I know."
30-12-2019T16:48:28,AspiringNoodle,Look at Disney.  They've been buying up companies left and right.  And it's predictable
30-12-2019T16:48:41,CrimsonQuill,And those who have sustained themselves for many years.
30-12-2019T16:48:43,AspiringNoodle,"They're more or less saturated their respective markets, and NEED to expand in order to please the investors"
30-12-2019T16:48:50,CrimsonQuill,"Oh, Disney is a GIANT."
30-12-2019T16:49:07,AspiringNoodle,"Yeah, it's only a matter of time before the government steps in to break them up"
30-12-2019T16:49:16,CrimsonQuill,"I am glad with what it did for the MCU, but it will eventually fall...hard."
30-12-2019T16:49:25,CrimsonQuill,Here's to the Underdogs.
30-12-2019T16:49:38,CrimsonQuill,because the Underdogs always find somewhere soft to bite...
30-12-2019T16:49:43,AspiringNoodle,"I've been laughing at Fallout 76 all year, haha"
30-12-2019T16:49:47,CrimsonQuill,"Anyhow, I am going to head for the night."
30-12-2019T16:49:58,CrimsonQuill,I'm going to read chapter 11 and go to bed...
30-12-2019T16:50:07,AspiringNoodle,"Night!  if I ever get my youtube under control, maybe I'll find more indie games to watch ;D"
30-12-2019T16:50:13,CrimsonQuill,Cheers!
30-12-2019T16:50:13,AspiringNoodle,play*
30-12-2019T16:50:19,CrimsonQuill,"See you next year, XD"
30-12-2019T16:50:22,AspiringNoodle,I wanna play Undertale / Night in the Woods...
30-12-2019T16:50:29,CrimsonQuill,Oh! Before I go...
30-12-2019T16:50:29,AspiringNoodle,Noodley dreams
30-12-2019T16:50:43,CrimsonQuill,Night in the Woods has been a Godsend of a game...
30-12-2019T16:50:57,CrimsonQuill,"It helped me get out of a dark spot, and find motivation to get a job."
30-12-2019T16:51:13,AspiringNoodle,"Hmmm, might push it up a few places in the backlog, then"
30-12-2019T16:51:14,CrimsonQuill,I'd say it's right up there with Halo and Undertale in my favourite videogames.
30-12-2019T16:51:20,AspiringNoodle,"And by that I mean 100 - 150+ places, ahahahahaha"
30-12-2019T16:51:23,CrimsonQuill,XD
30-12-2019T16:51:24,CrimsonQuill,Well.
30-12-2019T16:51:26,CrimsonQuill,Goodnight
30-12-2019T16:51:30,CrimsonQuill,Cya tomorrow
30-12-2019T16:51:33,AspiringNoodle,WoW's a bitch :P
30-12-2019T16:51:34,AspiringNoodle,Night!

30-12-2019T17:37:58,TerraTheWizard,so much wasted space
30-12-2019T17:38:04,AspiringNoodle,The new UI looks nice and has some good QoL changes
30-12-2019T17:38:12,AspiringNoodle,But I don't like how the top sections literally blew up
30-12-2019T17:38:41,TerraTheWizard,i'm probably gonna stick with the classic style until it breaks
30-12-2019T17:38:55,AspiringNoodle,I have to scroll down an entire page to see the gallery / journal :/
30-12-2019T17:38:56,TerraTheWizard,because they said it's deprecated now
30-12-2019T17:40:33,AspiringNoodle,They just need to rearrange some of the page layout
30-12-2019T17:41:00,TerraTheWizard,mhm
30-12-2019T17:41:00,AspiringNoodle,"Shrink it down shove it off to the right above the journal section, and s'all good"
30-12-2019T17:41:29,TerraTheWizard,"the browse filters need to go back above the results, instead of taking up 1/5 of the right hand side"
30-12-2019T17:44:03,AspiringNoodle,I think I'm good with that
30-12-2019T17:44:19,AspiringNoodle,I just don't like that the first section on every artist's page blew up in size :c
30-12-2019T17:46:24,TeapotOfDoom,(Nearly) happy new year everybody :ctwokinds-nibsbounce:

30-12-2019T17:49:56,AspiringNoodle,Here's hoping FA can improve the UI ;)
30-12-2019T17:50:07,AspiringNoodle,"Seriously, looks nice!  Just needs some adjustments on sizing / layout"

30-12-2019T19:10:36,AspiringNoodle,Would be nicer if WoW wasn't lagging like crazy
30-12-2019T19:10:39,AspiringNoodle,I don't know what's causing it!
30-12-2019T19:12:50,AspiringNoodle,"Oh shooooooot, I wonder if WoW is being DDOS'd again"
30-12-2019T19:13:53,AspiringNoodle,"""Some #WoW players may be experiencing latency or disconnections. We are investigating this now."" As of 20 seconds ago on the official CS twitter, lol"
