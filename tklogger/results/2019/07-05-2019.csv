07-05-2019T01:03:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Overachieving. Sounds right

07-05-2019T11:10:17,Orthonox,The most important reference sheet has been made.
07-05-2019T11:10:37,unsteddyphoenix,Oh her name actually is Jade
07-05-2019T11:10:47,unsteddyphoenix,Kinda nice
07-05-2019T11:11:25,unsteddyphoenix,"5'8 is average basitin height? That seems too tall, thats almost average human height IRL?"
07-05-2019T11:13:46,Orthonox,5'9 is average male height (at least in the USA)
07-05-2019T11:16:11,unsteddyphoenix,"I thought Keith was average, honestly."
07-05-2019T11:16:13,Orthonox,"Hey Tom, I wanna say I find it cool that Addy is in her 50s."
07-05-2019T11:16:29,Orthonox,Keith is short.

07-05-2019T11:23:24,unsteddyphoenix,Shrug. Seems wrong to me.
07-05-2019T11:23:34,unsteddyphoenix,But perhaps I had the wrong idea this whole time
07-05-2019T11:26:14,iliar,"Tom, it's not ""Sketch comics""."

07-05-2019T15:09:54,BadFoMo,I had a question?
07-05-2019T15:12:07,iliar,"At first. Nibs watches when picarto creates a new record, automatically downloads it, converts it and upload on YouTube."
07-05-2019T15:14:00,Twokinds,Thanks!
07-05-2019T15:14:06,Twokinds,"You know, this page wasn't in the original script."
07-05-2019T15:14:12,CrimsonQuill,Really?
07-05-2019T15:14:18,Twokinds,It was actually a last minute addition.
07-05-2019T15:14:24,CrimsonQuill,Oh!
07-05-2019T15:14:42,CrimsonQuill,"Well, that's unexpected."
07-05-2019T15:14:57,CrimsonQuill,It's still really nice.
07-05-2019T15:15:08,Twokinds,"I figured there should be more of a transition between the previous and next page, and I wanted Maren and Sythe to talk a little."
07-05-2019T15:15:11,CrimsonQuill,"I mean, Maren's furious expression in the last panel is a thing of joy."
07-05-2019T15:15:16,CrimsonQuill,I can see that.
07-05-2019T15:15:16,iliar,"Then Nibs monitors the streams status and when the stream starts, she writes all the received data to the disk. But you need to manually convert this data. This is a backup copy in case picarto does not create record.."
07-05-2019T15:15:38,CrimsonQuill,How long did it take for you to create Nibblybot Iliar?
07-05-2019T15:15:55,Azumachan,How's going ?
07-05-2019T15:16:12,CrimsonQuill,Fine thanks Azuma! :ptv-victory:

07-05-2019T15:16:27,iliar,And also Nibs always log all text messages in the chat.
07-05-2019T15:16:37,CrimsonQuill,Woah.
07-05-2019T15:16:45,BadFoMo,"@iliar Oh, right. I knew that (you told us a while ago); I was wounding if Nibbly's chat recorder was up and running again, and you confirmed it. ...You did confirm it, right?"
07-05-2019T15:17:33,iliar,"@BadFoMo I'm not sure what you mean when you said about ""Nibbly's chat recorder"" But I think I answered your question."
07-05-2019T15:19:00,Twokinds,I finally did it - I scheduled a doctor's appointment.
07-05-2019T15:19:10,Twokinds,For the first time in a looong time. XD
07-05-2019T15:19:28,CrimsonQuill,Is it a checkup or something else Tom?
07-05-2019T15:19:32,BadFoMo,I'm talking about the part of the Bot that records what we're saying here in the chat.
07-05-2019T15:19:38,BadFoMo,@iliar
07-05-2019T15:19:55,BadFoMo,"Also, I have to leave now."
07-05-2019T15:20:00,iliar,"@Azumachan Hi. In fact, your question puzzles me. I do not know how to answer the question ""how are you"". I am pretty sure that you do not want to know the real answer. I mean not very politely complaining to strangers about their problems."
07-05-2019T15:20:00,BadFoMo,Bye.
07-05-2019T15:20:25,Orthonox,"Good for you, Tom. The next step is actually being there."

07-05-2019T15:30:12,Twokinds,Yeah
07-05-2019T15:30:31,Twokinds,I haven't seen this doctor in ages. I can't believe he's still doing doctoring.
07-05-2019T15:30:44,Twokinds,It's amazing that someone can stick with the same job for decades.
07-05-2019T15:31:10,Azumachan,I hope everything will be okay.
07-05-2019T15:31:30,iliar,Said a man who for 15+ years draws one comic.
07-05-2019T15:31:35,Twokinds,Heheh
07-05-2019T15:32:42,CrimsonQuill,I don't know if I would have that patience...
07-05-2019T15:32:52,CrimsonQuill,I neither have patience nor the patience to develop patience.
07-05-2019T15:33:05,CrimsonQuill,Which is a huge problem.
07-05-2019T15:34:04,TerraTheWizard,[patience doctor pun]
07-05-2019T15:34:10,Twokinds,There are books on patience and discipline. It's a skill you can learn.
07-05-2019T15:55:30,CrimsonQuill,Indeed...
07-05-2019T15:55:40,CrimsonQuill,I only hope that I can learn to learn patience...
07-05-2019T16:03:29,Twokinds,I'm trying to learn as well.
07-05-2019T16:03:33,Twokinds,I want to write a book this year.
07-05-2019T16:03:37,Twokinds,Start to finish.
07-05-2019T16:03:50,CrimsonQuill,"Ooooh, that's interesting!"
07-05-2019T16:04:07,CrimsonQuill,Didn't you say in your bio or something that Twokinds started out as a book before it became a comic?
07-05-2019T16:06:42,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
07-05-2019T16:08:38,Twokinds,I guess so
07-05-2019T16:09:01,CrimsonQuill,What idea do you have in mind for the book>
07-05-2019T16:16:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Haven‚Äôt seen the doc in ages huh? You may walk in for a visit and they‚Äôll be like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre still alive?‚Äù
07-05-2019T16:22:15,Twokinds,lol
07-05-2019T16:22:25,Twokinds,"Yeah, I'm afraid they're going to say they don't have any of my paperwork anymore"
07-05-2019T16:22:32,Twokinds,And I'll have to spend an hour filling out forms.
07-05-2019T16:22:48,CrimsonQuill,Forms are incredibly tedious alright...
07-05-2019T16:22:49,Twokinds,I probably need boosters for all my vaccinations.
07-05-2019T16:23:01,Twokinds,"I wonder if they can do that this time, or if I'll have to schedule another visit."
07-05-2019T16:25:02,Azumachan,I think you have to reschedule for that.
07-05-2019T16:25:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Most likely
07-05-2019T16:26:27,SpazztasticKiwi,"But hey. At least you‚Äôll be covered. And as for forms, you‚Äôll probably have to do some but I‚Äôm 90% sure it‚Äôs illegal to just throw out records"
07-05-2019T16:27:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Some places still have my dads it seems. We got mail for him even a couple years after his death
07-05-2019T16:29:41,SpazztasticKiwi,So what brought this on?
07-05-2019T16:34:55,SpazztasticKiwi,break done

07-05-2019T17:04:23,Twokinds,Nothing specific.
07-05-2019T17:05:15,BluePhantom90,huh I just remembered a Character from a Anime that kinda made me wonder
07-05-2019T17:05:39,BluePhantom90,thought maybe that was part of the inspiration
07-05-2019T17:08:42,BluePhantom90,should check out Outlaw Star and you would see
07-05-2019T17:18:51,Xexanoth,The King Adelaide was pure divine Inspiration obviously
07-05-2019T17:19:23,BluePhantom90,lol I know But a Character on that show would make you wonder lol.
