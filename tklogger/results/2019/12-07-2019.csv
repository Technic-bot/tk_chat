12-07-2019T00:56:00,Dadrobit,"Was gonna say, unless they're being rolled on a velvet table, I'm sticking them on a shelf."
12-07-2019T00:56:15,FenceEqualizer,She has the right idea
12-07-2019T00:57:13,Ordithus,Roll them on a glass table.  Live dangerously
12-07-2019T00:57:31,RimaDraws,this would be a nice poster
12-07-2019T00:58:28,SageSaga,Amethyst is one of my all time favorite gemstones ever since i got the chance to crack open a geode myself and found it filled with beautiful purple amethyst crystals
12-07-2019T00:58:29,Mihari,The was the idea.
12-07-2019T01:00:31,SageSaga,whenever i give gemstones as treasure i 90% of the time give some amethysts
12-07-2019T01:01:01,SageSaga,dont know if they every noticed that
12-07-2019T01:01:26,Dadrobit,#DMQuirks
12-07-2019T01:01:38,Mihari,"Of course I did, I tend to horde them, don't know if you noticed that XD"
12-07-2019T01:01:44,Dadrobit,Lol
12-07-2019T01:01:56,Mihari,I helps when you managed the treasure 90% of the time.
12-07-2019T01:04:46,Dadrobit,Do y'all use carry weight stuffs in your campaigns?
12-07-2019T01:07:27,Dadrobit,"Used to play with a DM that kept meticulous track of every coin and it's weight on all of us. It was annoying whenever it came up to bite us, but otherwise he was a great guy."
12-07-2019T01:07:48,SageSaga,yes i do count carry weight
12-07-2019T01:08:02,SageSaga,but im generous with my magical items so bags of holding are very common
12-07-2019T01:09:02,RoyyalistStudios,Herro peoples! :ptv-greetings:

12-07-2019T01:10:41,RoyyalistStudios,"I've only ever played once, but everyone else I had played with were idiots and I was the only one whom the DM apparently liked."
12-07-2019T01:10:54,Ordithus,Don't want to get bogged down in detials
12-07-2019T01:11:28,Sclimshady,"Im falling asleep, night everyone and thanks for the stream Sage o/"

12-07-2019T01:15:58,SageSaga,our camp got overrun by swarms of giant centipedes so i grabbed the halfling and his equipment and levitated us up into the air- we rained death upon them and then went down to heal our allies unfortunate enough to not be tiny people i can lift
12-07-2019T01:16:34,FenceEqualizer,Sounds like a fun build. The killanything wizard. Just full strength
12-07-2019T01:17:07,SageSaga,Muscle Wizard - like Rune Soldier Loie
12-07-2019T01:17:37,SageSaga,he ran of spells so he broke his wand over the head of a goblin and that really pissed him off so he fist fought off the waves of mobs
12-07-2019T01:19:25,FenceEqualizer,That's hilarious and bad ass. Why is that robed mage so ripped!
12-07-2019T01:19:35,SageSaga,also reminds me of my Halfling Warlock that got gauntlets of Ogre strength
12-07-2019T01:19:38,Ordithus,Gotta have hobbies

12-07-2019T01:56:08,MatyMaty,"ah, towergirls is an RPG thing. Is difficult to explain, but a quick google will show you the general aesthetic."
12-07-2019T01:56:38,BadFoMo,Thanks.
12-07-2019T01:56:46,MatyMaty,"The whole thing is about a knight chosing which princess to save. There are a lot. Dragon princess, goblin princess, kobold princess and so on"
12-07-2019T01:56:58,unsteddyphoenix,Welp. Im sold.

12-07-2019T01:58:07,MatyMaty,"you can't :P some are poly, but others are like NOPE about being in an harem"
12-07-2019T01:58:16,MatyMaty,"no no, dragon princess"
12-07-2019T01:58:34,MatyMaty,a princess that is a dragon
12-07-2019T01:58:56,Dadrobit,... what dragon princess needs saving? I'd expect her to save herself no?
12-07-2019T01:59:02,unsteddyphoenix,The goblin princess is so stacked lmao
12-07-2019T01:59:32,MatyMaty,"Nope, you gotta save her"
12-07-2019T01:59:55,MatyMaty,it is called towergirls because each princess is locked in a tower

12-07-2019T02:00:20,unsteddyphoenix,Basically?
12-07-2019T02:00:52,unsteddyphoenix,Even a dragon girl might like to feel like a princess sometimes dad
12-07-2019T02:00:58,unsteddyphoenix,You gotta understand a maidens heart~
12-07-2019T02:01:33,Dadrobit,Sometimes the Noble knight wants a day off every once in a while.
12-07-2019T02:01:43,SageSaga,bro

12-07-2019T02:02:10,unsteddyphoenix,Am I not above the rules?
12-07-2019T02:02:16,SageSaga,no
12-07-2019T02:02:27,Dadrobit,Are you not entertained?!?
12-07-2019T02:02:30,unsteddyphoenix,Bleh. Fiiine.
12-07-2019T02:03:22,unsteddyphoenix,This game looks crazy convoluted. Which is a plus for me.
12-07-2019T02:03:41,Dadrobit,Is it available on mobile?
12-07-2019T02:04:11,MatyMaty,"I dunno, Dadrobit"
12-07-2019T02:05:14,MatyMaty,I don't think so as it is an indie thing ;_;
12-07-2019T02:05:25,ZRO4825,Final Fantasy Tactics map music ftw
12-07-2019T02:05:39,MatyMaty,Zro

12-07-2019T02:05:48,ZRO4825,For what?
12-07-2019T02:05:49,MatyMaty,that is not the map
12-07-2019T02:05:51,MatyMaty,music
12-07-2019T02:05:55,Dadrobit,Lol
12-07-2019T02:06:00,MatyMaty,it is the select save game music
12-07-2019T02:06:02,ZRO4825,"In my defense, I haven't played Tactics in like...12 years."
12-07-2019T02:06:21,MatyMaty,XD
12-07-2019T02:06:25,SageSaga,we need Tactics to be released on PC and switch
12-07-2019T02:06:41,ZRO4825,I'd love to see a visually updated but mechanically untouched remaster of that game. <3
12-07-2019T02:06:43,MatyMaty,is funny taht being so cutesy
12-07-2019T02:06:53,MatyMaty,is maybe the darkest Final Fantasy game
12-07-2019T02:07:01,Dadrobit,And PS4 please. It being updated only to PS3 is a travesty.
12-07-2019T02:07:03,ZRO4825,Tactics Advance was fun....except for the stupid laws <_<
12-07-2019T02:07:39,Dadrobit,"ZRO, are you counting out the War of the Lions remake?"
12-07-2019T02:07:42,SageSaga,"LAW! No forced movement! ""Critical hit!"" YOU LOSE FOR FORCED MOVEMENT!"

12-07-2019T02:09:27,MatyMaty,I loved how the intro made such a big deal of those guys riding the chocobos
12-07-2019T02:09:33,SageSaga,am i good?
12-07-2019T02:09:33,BadFoMo,Good night?
12-07-2019T02:09:42,SpazztasticKiwi,are you?
12-07-2019T02:09:44,MatyMaty,only for them to be mooks who got killed in the tutorial
12-07-2019T02:09:49,SageSaga,i dunno
12-07-2019T02:09:51,Dadrobit,Sage is just ranting about bad game design stuffs.
12-07-2019T02:09:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I know
12-07-2019T02:10:05,SpazztasticKiwi,just sounds like he’s having a bit of a crisis
12-07-2019T02:10:15,MatyMaty,:scream:
12-07-2019T02:10:22,MatyMaty,"Are you, Sage?"
12-07-2019T02:10:30,SageSaga,nope
12-07-2019T02:10:50,SpazztasticKiwi,we all need to have the occasional crisis
12-07-2019T02:10:57,SpazztasticKiwi,or rant
12-07-2019T02:11:13,SpazztasticKiwi,or cathartic scream to the void
12-07-2019T02:11:15,Dadrobit,"Mid life crisis Sage ""Back in my day, game design centered around making the game challenging AND fun!"""
12-07-2019T02:11:39,Dadrobit,*rabble rabble*
12-07-2019T02:11:53,SageSaga,my only problem at this moment is that im coughing for NO REASON
12-07-2019T02:12:04,MatyMaty,"You can scream into my cleavage as much as you want, Sage :v"
12-07-2019T02:12:16,SpazztasticKiwi,pineapple juice has a no cough thingy in it
12-07-2019T02:12:21,unsteddyphoenix,lewd?
12-07-2019T02:12:22,SpazztasticKiwi,can’t think of the word
12-07-2019T02:12:25,SageSaga,i dont know how that would help?
12-07-2019T02:12:42,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s like the chemical in cough drops or something
12-07-2019T02:12:48,Dadrobit,Pineapple would likely fuck sage up though with his stomach.
12-07-2019T02:12:59,SpazztasticKiwi,oooo
12-07-2019T02:12:59,MatyMaty,"uh, I had no idea of that"
12-07-2019T02:13:01,SpazztasticKiwi,shame
12-07-2019T02:13:14,SpazztasticKiwi,we’ll have fun with that. hope you survive the night
12-07-2019T02:13:17,SpazztasticKiwi,well
12-07-2019T02:15:00,MatyMaty,man I loved this game so much ;_;
12-07-2019T02:17:14,Dadrobit,"No joke, it had some of the best self contained political commentary in a game ever."
12-07-2019T02:17:56,BadFoMo,What game?
12-07-2019T02:18:08,Dadrobit,Final fantasy Tactics
12-07-2019T02:18:15,MatyMaty,Final Fantasy Tactics
12-07-2019T02:18:23,BadFoMo,Thanks.
12-07-2019T02:18:37,MatyMaty,"it had stuff you didn't saw in other games, and stuff that wouldn't fly today"
12-07-2019T02:20:58,Dadrobit,"Ehhh, I don't think that it wouldn't fly in terms of overall reception, but yeah, big studios are probably going to stay away from games with this much yucky stuff."
12-07-2019T02:21:18,Mihari,Yucky stuff?
12-07-2019T02:21:39,MatyMaty,well FFT has a number of raep theme situations
12-07-2019T02:22:14,Dadrobit,"Familicide, deeply corrupt governments and religious institutions, and implied child rape to boot."
12-07-2019T02:23:19,MatyMaty,and don't forget the part where the bandits were gonna abuse the Aerith cameo and force her into prostitution
12-07-2019T02:24:09,ZRO4825,"I find it odd how we're supposed to be advancing as a society, yet stuff like that is all ""You can't do that!"" It's like, well, sorry, that's how BAD situations go sometimes? What, you want us to just ignore that's a thing that happens sometimes?"
12-07-2019T02:24:38,Dadrobit,Yes. Definitely ignore it. Ignoring stuff makes it to away right?
12-07-2019T02:26:31,Dadrobit,"For real though, especially in the wotl remaster, it had some of the best villian dialogue ever."
12-07-2019T02:27:34,Dadrobit,There were some truly deeply brilliantly evil lines in there.
12-07-2019T02:27:37,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Oh goodness thats a happy face<3
12-07-2019T02:27:44,MatyMaty,"""animals have no god!"""
12-07-2019T02:28:27,Dadrobit,You have been an animal below me from the moment your father sired your mother in the gutters!

12-07-2019T02:31:08,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Well she's doing an A+ job <3
12-07-2019T02:31:21,ZRO4825,Must pet fluffy ears <3
12-07-2019T02:31:54,SageSaga,get your idea yet for your picture Zro?
12-07-2019T02:32:00,ZRO4825,o.o;
12-07-2019T02:32:05,ZRO4825,It's Maty's fault.
12-07-2019T02:36:54,SageSaga,yay! Journey Quest season 4 just barely made its funding!
12-07-2019T02:37:10,MatyMaty,:P
12-07-2019T02:37:33,MatyMaty,is my faunt you have no ideas? or my fault for the idea you have?
12-07-2019T02:37:37,MatyMaty,"er, fault"
12-07-2019T02:42:02,ZRO4825,I'm going to go with yes.
12-07-2019T02:42:31,ZRO4825,Toyoko cosplaying Matypup? =D
12-07-2019T02:42:52,MatyMaty,XD
12-07-2019T02:43:19,MatyMaty,"that's either the witch outfit, or Toyoko fursuiting :P"
12-07-2019T02:44:07,ZRO4825,:joy:
12-07-2019T02:44:21,ZRO4825,"Yeah, I guess we don't see Maty in clothes much sometimes, do we? XD"
12-07-2019T02:45:12,SageSaga,plz dont corrupt Zro- then i have to feel bad by denying him his pictures for the month
12-07-2019T02:45:27,ZRO4825,What's left to corrupt? I watch Flufff's streams. o_o
12-07-2019T02:45:54,SageSaga,watching someone draw porn does not corrupt someone
12-07-2019T02:46:10,ZRO4825,Well then what DOES consistute corrupting? :joy:
12-07-2019T02:46:44,SageSaga,you know that i dont want to draw things especially my characters like Toyoko being too lewd
12-07-2019T02:46:54,ZRO4825,"I know, this why I like to joke around <3"
12-07-2019T02:46:55,SageSaga,but you are being corrupted to request such things
12-07-2019T02:46:58,unsteddyphoenix,Watching someone make pron out of a toy animal from a kids show
12-07-2019T02:47:03,unsteddyphoenix,Might corrupt you
12-07-2019T02:47:07,MatyMaty,I am too lewd? XD
12-07-2019T02:47:13,ZRO4825,MatyLewd~
12-07-2019T02:47:31,unsteddyphoenix,"So, Fluffs streams can be fairly corrupting~"
12-07-2019T02:47:42,ZRO4825,"Didn't you know, Maty? Big boobers automatically add a 75% lewd rating."
12-07-2019T02:48:01,ZRO4825,"Tis why you can have Rieko doing something cute, but if Toyoko does it it's lewd. :P"
12-07-2019T02:48:14,MatyMaty,:P
12-07-2019T02:49:17,Dadrobit,"Wait, I was out with a client for a hot second, who's doing what with what toys???"
12-07-2019T02:49:23,ZRO4825,XD
12-07-2019T02:49:26,Bgrmystr2,"to be fair, I don't think Maty needs to do anything for zro to have suggested something lewd if you allowed such a suggestion, Sage"
12-07-2019T02:49:40,Bgrmystr2,so I don't think Maty could corrupt what was already corrupted to begin with.
12-07-2019T02:49:45,Bgrmystr2,:v
12-07-2019T02:49:49,ZRO4825,"Oy, who you callin corrupted? D:<"
12-07-2019T02:49:57,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-snicker: ehhe
12-07-2019T02:50:19,ZRO4825,I am perfectly uncorrupted! I have a Kaylin daki to prove it!

12-07-2019T02:50:53,unsteddyphoenix,"Look up ""fluff kevlar"" and ""reptar"""
12-07-2019T02:51:00,unsteddyphoenix,Thats all i'll say~
12-07-2019T02:51:04,ZRO4825,I was there when he drew that one. :P
12-07-2019T02:51:17,unsteddyphoenix,Confirmed corrupted
12-07-2019T02:51:19,SageSaga,Kaylins boobs ward away evil
12-07-2019T02:51:31,ZRO4825,"Can attest to this, I have had pleasant dreams."
12-07-2019T02:51:36,Dadrobit,"I mean, I know Fluff, but Reptar? That's gotta be an ~inspired~ picture..."
12-07-2019T02:51:38,MatyMaty,"unsteady, if you find that scandalous you haven't been on the internet long enough :P"
12-07-2019T02:52:29,unsteddyphoenix,I just dont think youre grasping the absurdity of it Maty
12-07-2019T02:52:40,MatyMaty,Unsteady
12-07-2019T02:52:45,MatyMaty,That series
12-07-2019T02:53:06,MatyMaty,came out 28 years ago
12-07-2019T02:53:18,MatyMaty,Nobody but grown ups remember it XD
12-07-2019T02:53:24,unsteddyphoenix,...woah.
12-07-2019T02:53:35,unsteddyphoenix,Way to age all of us
12-07-2019T02:54:25,ZRO4825,:joy:
12-07-2019T02:54:40,MatyMaty,"so, it is as much of a kids show as the OG TMNT or Animaniacs. It was. For kids who were born three decades ago :P"
12-07-2019T02:54:48,unsteddyphoenix,In summary; fluffs streams could totally corrupt someone and I wouldnt have it any other way
12-07-2019T02:55:05,ZRO4825,Is it Fluff's streams that corrupt us? Or is it we that corrupt Fluff's streams?
12-07-2019T02:55:15,Dadrobit,Reptar: For kids ages 18 and up
12-07-2019T02:55:15,ZRO4825,"I mean, we've already proven I can corrupt a patreon. :V"
12-07-2019T02:55:32,MatyMaty,For kids 28 and up :P
12-07-2019T02:55:36,unsteddyphoenix,Heh
12-07-2019T02:55:43,Bgrmystr2,"Oy who were you yellin at before about sayin you were corrupted, zro? :P"
12-07-2019T02:55:56,unsteddyphoenix,"Patrons dont lewd people, artists lewd people~"
12-07-2019T02:56:17,ZRO4825,"I have no idea what sort of inconsistencies you're attempting to point out about my well-made defenses, Bgr."
12-07-2019T02:56:25,Bgrmystr2,yeah sure okay
12-07-2019T02:56:41,Dadrobit,"Honestly, the Reptar picture is super take tbh. Gotta hit up people with more than that for ""corruption""."
12-07-2019T02:56:43,SageSaga,artist dont get as much of a say as you may think
12-07-2019T02:57:03,Dadrobit,Super safe*
12-07-2019T02:57:17,Dadrobit,Super tame******
12-07-2019T02:57:28,unsteddyphoenix,Its not about what it is
12-07-2019T02:57:31,unsteddyphoenix,Its about what it REPRESENTS
12-07-2019T02:57:35,Dadrobit,Typing shitting the bed in a big way.
12-07-2019T02:57:59,MatyMaty,what does it represent? :P
12-07-2019T02:58:59,Dadrobit,I mean... I guess the sexualization of a children's toy from a children's show is pretty fucked if you spend a bit of time thinking too hard.
12-07-2019T02:59:05,unsteddyphoenix,Childhood nostalgia...CORRUPTED
12-07-2019T02:59:25,MatyMaty,By that logic about everything r34 is fucked up
12-07-2019T02:59:40,MatyMaty,"like, every single Princess Peach lewd fanart"
12-07-2019T02:59:41,MarvTheHugPharaoh,pls no more r34ing Jenna ;-;
12-07-2019T02:59:42,MatyMaty,is the same
12-07-2019T02:59:42,SageSaga,and with that - change the subject everyone
12-07-2019T02:59:49,unsteddyphoenix,"A lot of it, yeah."
12-07-2019T03:00:03,unsteddyphoenix,Adventure time is messed up in itself though
12-07-2019T03:00:09,unsteddyphoenix,"""kids show"""
12-07-2019T03:00:17,Dadrobit,"Back in my day, my children's shows corrupted themselves! Here's to Rent and Stumpy and Rocko's Modern Life!"
12-07-2019T03:00:18,MatyMaty,"Mmmmmm, they are bringing the Sith back in Episode 9"
12-07-2019T03:00:29,MatyMaty,and there are Sith troopers :P
12-07-2019T03:00:49,SageSaga,was that confirmed?
12-07-2019T03:01:03,Dadrobit,"Ren* goddamn Google keyboard is pissing me off, 5 seconds from switching to Samsung..."
12-07-2019T03:01:07,MatyMaty,"yup, it seems the red stormtroopers are sith troopers"
12-07-2019T03:02:27,sunblaze,hi everyone
12-07-2019T03:02:47,Dadrobit,"Is the 9th epsiode going to be a ""conclusion"" in the same way as 6 and 3 were? Or are they just gonna keep it going?"
12-07-2019T03:02:53,MatyMaty,They will even have an exhibition in Comic Con
12-07-2019T03:02:55,SageSaga,yo Sunblaze!
12-07-2019T03:03:01,Dadrobit,o/ sun
12-07-2019T03:03:04,MatyMaty,and they were officially named sith troopers
12-07-2019T03:03:16,sunblaze,keep going imho. disney is not that good at actually finishing a series
12-07-2019T03:03:25,MatyMaty,"Dadrobit, Star Wars is the biggest cash cow Disney has"
12-07-2019T03:03:26,Dadrobit,I kinda want to finally catch up with the series before I die.
12-07-2019T03:03:34,MatyMaty,they will not stop using it anytime soon
12-07-2019T03:03:34,SageSaga,Maty uhm
12-07-2019T03:03:36,SageSaga,Marvel
12-07-2019T03:03:42,MatyMaty,Oh?
12-07-2019T03:03:46,sunblaze,ha good luck with that dandrobit :D
12-07-2019T03:03:49,SageSaga,Marvel is bigger
12-07-2019T03:03:51,MatyMaty,Marvel is bigger than Star Wars? :O
12-07-2019T03:03:55,SageSaga,yeah
12-07-2019T03:04:03,SageSaga,more movies more wins
12-07-2019T03:04:04,sunblaze,in cashing out for sure
12-07-2019T03:04:11,MatyMaty,"well, still is not something I think Disney would abandon"
12-07-2019T03:04:13,Dadrobit,But I don't want to start it up again just to be left on a bullshit cliffhanger.
12-07-2019T03:04:13,sunblaze,more chars = more movies and more merchandise
12-07-2019T03:04:40,SageSaga,even when they bomb - they do better than Solo
12-07-2019T03:04:47,MatyMaty,yeaah
12-07-2019T03:04:59,Dadrobit,"I don't imply that they'd abandon it, just give it a decent conclusion and a decade of rest to build it back up."
12-07-2019T03:05:05,SageSaga,Sunblaze- what did ya want this month?
12-07-2019T03:05:23,MatyMaty,They already said there will be another trilogy after
12-07-2019T03:05:39,MatyMaty,different characters
12-07-2019T03:05:41,SageSaga,i am looking forward to KotR from Disney
12-07-2019T03:05:43,MatyMaty,but same universe
12-07-2019T03:06:00,Dadrobit,"But the 7,8,9 episodes will be self contained?"
12-07-2019T03:06:00,MatyMaty,what will end is the Skywalker storyline
12-07-2019T03:06:20,sunblaze,also @ sage: this month I'd like Maya in what happens after she I'd like Maya after she got teleported out. What is she doing: sulking around? throwing more knives?
12-07-2019T03:06:21,Dadrobit,That'd be all I'm after.
12-07-2019T03:06:30,MatyMaty,so I wonder if Rey was a Skywalker after all
12-07-2019T03:06:42,sunblaze,stupid picarto and its chatlags :P
12-07-2019T03:06:58,MatyMaty,or if she's gonna be Palpatine's clone/daughter/thing like a couple friends think
12-07-2019T03:07:48,sunblaze,I stopped caring after the mid of Episode 8. the first half was good the last just draging and stupid. Luke was the only light in that movie after all
12-07-2019T03:07:54,sunblaze,(as cliche as that sounds)
12-07-2019T03:09:03,SageSaga,just want to know if the KotoR thing is gonna be a TV series or a Movie series
12-07-2019T03:09:25,MatyMaty,I hope movies
12-07-2019T03:10:26,Dadrobit,Kotor is one game I really do need to get around to playing.
12-07-2019T03:10:47,sunblaze,NEVER play Kotor 2 without mods
12-07-2019T03:10:56,sunblaze,unless you like whipping yourself for fun
12-07-2019T03:11:00,MatyMaty,"I think you and Mihari liked the game a lot, Sage?"
12-07-2019T03:11:05,sunblaze,but not if you are a sensible human being
12-07-2019T03:11:12,SageSaga,which ones?
12-07-2019T03:11:19,MatyMaty,KOTOR
12-07-2019T03:11:27,SageSaga,I wasnt a big fan of ToR but i loved KoToR
12-07-2019T03:12:06,SageSaga,bigger fan of the Pen and Paper RPG in that Era
12-07-2019T03:12:42,SageSaga,would love to see a movie about the jedi civil war
12-07-2019T03:12:46,ZRO4825,KOTOR was fun as hell <3
12-07-2019T03:13:23,MatyMaty,"well we also need to find out what is still canon and what fell into the ""legends"" sinkhole"
12-07-2019T03:13:35,Mihari,"I loved both ToR and KotoR, but I wish ToR had been a singleplayer with all it's multiple story lines."
12-07-2019T03:14:24,sunblaze,"didn't they say only the movies are canon and all books, games and spinn-offcomics are legends?"
12-07-2019T03:14:27,SageSaga,"""Oh thank the force! The mandalorians are here!"" ""The Mandalorians are working with the sith now!"" ""OH NO! THE MANDALORIANS ARE HERE!"""
12-07-2019T03:14:40,SageSaga,nope
12-07-2019T03:14:45,MatyMaty,yeah Sunblaze
12-07-2019T03:14:48,MatyMaty,I think
12-07-2019T03:14:52,SageSaga,nope

12-07-2019T11:01:21,IronHorseComics,I left about midnight EST

12-07-2019T11:02:14,Ordithus,Clovis was probably leading it and teleported away.
12-07-2019T11:02:35,CrimsonQuill,I'd always assumed that the leader had been punched....
12-07-2019T11:02:40,CrimsonQuill,I suppose I was wrong.

12-07-2019T11:28:25,RimaDraws,i dont know but its possible
12-07-2019T11:28:30,IronHorseComics,I don't see why not?
12-07-2019T11:29:09,IronHorseComics,or maybe have it like Narnia: Prince Caspian and have Trace and Brahn have a magic duel in front of two large armies
12-07-2019T11:29:51,RimaDraws,oooooh yesss
12-07-2019T11:29:57,RimaDraws,never saw that movie or read the book

12-07-2019T11:30:14,RimaDraws,like the endgame battle
12-07-2019T11:30:20,CrimsonQuill,Not seen Endgame yet

12-07-2019T11:30:27,RimaDraws,you should watch it
12-07-2019T11:30:35,RimaDraws,anyhoo
12-07-2019T11:31:30,IronHorseComics,I have a long laundry list of movies to see
12-07-2019T11:32:16,IronHorseComics,"the latest one I've seen is Captain America Civil War (which I love to death), I just hadn't gotten around to seeing the other ones"
12-07-2019T11:32:36,Ordithus,Lots of good ones since
12-07-2019T11:32:46,CrimsonQuill,I love Civil War
12-07-2019T11:32:54,CrimsonQuill,It's such a well-directed film.
12-07-2019T11:33:00,IronHorseComics,it was a lot better than the stupid comic that's for sure
12-07-2019T11:36:36,RimaDraws,i got a shit ton of things to watch
12-07-2019T11:38:19,RimaDraws,netflix and crunchyroll
12-07-2019T11:38:19,IronHorseComics,but anyway what happens in Prince Caspian is that the main villain (I'll call him King Douchebag because I forgot his actual name) challenges Peter to a one on one sword fight to the death complete with knight armor and shields...
12-07-2019T11:38:29,RimaDraws,oh wow
12-07-2019T11:40:07,IronHorseComics,"Peter wins but doesn't kill him, the fight for the most part is mostly realistic actually, minus a couple instances where Peter's strike somehow gets King Douchebag through his armor but hey it's a movie"
12-07-2019T11:42:04,IronHorseComics,"it may have played differently in the book, I hadn't gotten around to reading it yet"
12-07-2019T11:42:10,TeapotOfDoom,wow i missed much in the few minutes i got caught up reading the comic...
12-07-2019T11:42:39,IronHorseComics,"believe it or not, The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe is NOT the first in the series, just the one that's most well known"
12-07-2019T11:42:47,TeapotOfDoom,@Terra yes it's mainly comsumed around christmas
12-07-2019T11:43:20,TeapotOfDoom,but i love it to bits and just found out that you can get it in summer as well. at least in some places
12-07-2019T11:43:49,IronHorseComics,"the first book is called ""The Magician's Nephew"""

12-07-2019T11:56:32,CrimsonQuill,:ctwokinds-kingtea:
12-07-2019T11:57:48,TeapotOfDoom,i forgot my headphone adapter at my parents place
12-07-2019T12:01:03,SpazztasticKiwi,today has that here comes the fukening feeling so here’s to hoping I don’t kill anyone today
12-07-2019T12:03:07,TeapotOfDoom,best of luck from me
12-07-2019T12:10:47,TerraTheWizard,so people were saying brutus is really tall
12-07-2019T12:10:56,TerraTheWizard,so i decided to figure out how tall
12-07-2019T12:10:58,TerraTheWizard,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/367090802251268098/599646670916943893/brutusheightis.png
12-07-2019T12:11:05,TerraTheWizard,"he'ss about 6'9"""
12-07-2019T12:12:05,IronHorseComics,yes I think there are some basketball scouts who want to speak with him
12-07-2019T12:13:29,TerraTheWizard,also that chart has adelaide because people were wondering their heights compared
12-07-2019T12:16:30,Dadrobit,10/10 detective work Terra.
12-07-2019T12:17:27,Dadrobit,"Also, I'm super duper happy. Just got my CCL certificate for Audio Engineering this morning!"
12-07-2019T12:18:16,Dadrobit,"Hopefully by the end of spring I'll finally be able to walk to get my Associates in it, and then I'm considering turning it into a Bachelors in business."
12-07-2019T12:18:31,IronHorseComics,nice
12-07-2019T12:18:59,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
12-07-2019T12:19:07,Dadrobit,"I know it's only a CCL, so it's nothing super impressive, but it does feel really good finally getting ~something~ noteworthy after being a former dropout."
12-07-2019T12:27:12,TeapotOfDoom,Nice
12-07-2019T12:28:20,TeapotOfDoom,I don't really know what a ccl is but it sounds like hard work to me
12-07-2019T12:28:35,TeapotOfDoom,so i tip my imaginary fedora to you
12-07-2019T12:29:15,TeapotOfDoom,also 10/10 detective work terra? what sketch is the right most image taken from? is this clovis' happy little family?
12-07-2019T12:29:22,TeapotOfDoom,*.
12-07-2019T12:31:58,Dadrobit,"CCL = Certificate of Course Completion. Essentially it means I took all of the classes to get an Associates in a specific topic, but didn't take all the ""foundational"" classes like Humanities and Sciences. But those will be done for me this coming spring."
12-07-2019T12:37:44,AspiringNoodle,"In the near future, this ""well rounded person"" crap in universities may go away ;P"
12-07-2019T12:38:19,AspiringNoodle,"Think about it, if you go to college to get a bachelors in X, why the hell would you need all those other courses?"
12-07-2019T12:38:48,AspiringNoodle,"If anything, it's a sneaky way for colleges to squeeze out extra cash"
12-07-2019T12:39:33,AspiringNoodle,"I'll be honest though, I didn't mind personally because I found my humanities fun <3"
12-07-2019T12:46:08,TerraTheWizard,@TeapotOfDoom yeah it was from this one https://www.patreon.com/posts/clovis-bad-dream-20105162
12-07-2019T12:46:45,IronHorseComics,I was wondering where that image you used from the chart is from
12-07-2019T12:47:21,Ordithus,"Nice stuff, Terra.  Congrats, robit!"
12-07-2019T12:48:57,TerraTheWizard,"which chart, there are technically 3 in that image"
12-07-2019T12:48:58,TerraTheWizard,lol
12-07-2019T12:49:02,Dadrobit,American Jazz & Popular Music is the humanities I'll be taking this upcoming semester. Then Spring is going to hopefully be an astronomy course for a science credit. Looking forward to that one since my college has a baller planetarium on campus.
12-07-2019T12:49:19,TerraTheWizard,i guess i could link them all

12-07-2019T12:51:17,TeapotOfDoom,also plottwist Buruts wakes up beside clovis and asks what's wrong
12-07-2019T12:52:41,TeapotOfDoom,Holy shit adelaid would be more then one head taller then me...
12-07-2019T12:52:53,TeapotOfDoom,Adelaide
12-07-2019T12:53:18,Ordithus,Adelaide ate her broccoli when she was a kid
12-07-2019T12:53:28,TeapotOfDoom,Turns out autotune can even make me sound good
12-07-2019T12:57:20,TeapotOfDoom,Go figure
12-07-2019T12:57:31,Dadrobit,"Yeah, the top of my head meets her shoulders. Stellar fucking body though."
12-07-2019T12:58:06,IronHorseComics,I'm personally okay with women being much taller than me
12-07-2019T12:58:32,IronHorseComics,"I mean I'm not 4'5"" or anything but still"
12-07-2019T12:59:01,TeapotOfDoom,I've no problem with it at all. But it's rather unusual to be honest
12-07-2019T12:59:45,AspiringNoodle,"I'm 6' 2"", so chances for me are minimal"
12-07-2019T13:00:05,TeapotOfDoom,I don't even know how tall i would be in imperial
12-07-2019T13:00:10,TeapotOfDoom,Metric for the wim
12-07-2019T13:00:12,TeapotOfDoom,win
12-07-2019T13:00:35,TeapotOfDoom,about 1.8 meters
12-07-2019T13:01:01,Dadrobit,I'm juuuust under 6 foot myself.
12-07-2019T13:01:01,Ordithus,"5'11"" is 1.8m"
12-07-2019T13:01:19,IronHorseComics,you're about might height
12-07-2019T13:02:12,TeapotOfDoom,well i just forgot that the imperial system does not use decades
12-07-2019T13:02:26,TeapotOfDoom,got confused cus it said 5.9 feet
12-07-2019T13:02:37,AspiringNoodle,1.88m
12-07-2019T13:02:38,AspiringNoodle,:3
12-07-2019T13:02:49,TeapotOfDoom,it's 12''=1' right
12-07-2019T13:02:57,AspiringNoodle,yas
12-07-2019T13:03:05,TeapotOfDoom,(just why...)
12-07-2019T13:03:19,IronHorseComics,because Britain
12-07-2019T13:03:27,IronHorseComics,they invented the imperial system
12-07-2019T13:03:28,TeapotOfDoom,1m=10dm=100cm=1000mm
12-07-2019T13:03:31,Ordithus,Base 10 isn't holy or something.  Just what we usually work in
12-07-2019T13:03:44,TeapotOfDoom,i know
12-07-2019T13:03:52,TeapotOfDoom,base 2 is way more conveniant
12-07-2019T13:03:59,TeapotOfDoom,like you would not believe
12-07-2019T13:04:02,Ordithus,We COULD have kiloyards
12-07-2019T13:04:21,Ordithus,"Just nobody does it, because the mile exists"
12-07-2019T13:04:38,TeapotOfDoom,You COULD have kilometers....
12-07-2019T13:04:47,AspiringNoodle,*rubs temple*  I regret looking for computer cases
12-07-2019T13:05:19,Ordithus,Also true.  The real reason to switch to metric is because everyone else uses it
12-07-2019T13:05:24,AspiringNoodle,"Also fuck imperial for most cases, lol"
12-07-2019T13:05:44,TeapotOfDoom,True but also the metric system is made to be easy
12-07-2019T13:06:25,AspiringNoodle,"Fahrenheit all day every day, [censored due to ungodly obsceneties]"
12-07-2019T13:06:38,IronHorseComics,yeah celcius sucks
12-07-2019T13:06:39,TeapotOfDoom,"Like I really don't have an issue with identity appart from everyone else using it but also if I would be American, why would I put up with such a complicated system"
12-07-2019T13:06:59,TeapotOfDoom,Why would celsius suck?
12-07-2019T13:07:08,Dadrobit,"Actually, base 12 is super great to be honest. This is completely separate from just talking about the imperial system, just as a base for counting."
12-07-2019T13:07:15,AspiringNoodle,"Fahrenheit allows for more precision imo, in a way that's easy to understand ;)"
12-07-2019T13:07:17,IronHorseComics,because farenheidt is far more descriptive
12-07-2019T13:07:30,AspiringNoodle,"For example, what is Fahrenheit 451?"
12-07-2019T13:07:33,TeapotOfDoom,You always know when it's freezing in Celsius
12-07-2019T13:07:46,TeapotOfDoom,Well i dunno
12-07-2019T13:08:00,AspiringNoodle,Celcius - 232.778
12-07-2019T13:08:10,Ordithus,We should just use base 12
12-07-2019T13:08:10,AspiringNoodle,But also the temperature at which paper spontaneously combusts
12-07-2019T13:08:13,Ordithus,Upend everything
12-07-2019T13:08:26,TeapotOfDoom,Why would i want to know that?
12-07-2019T13:08:35,AspiringNoodle,"I just made a smidge of a point, lol"
12-07-2019T13:08:45,AspiringNoodle,451 vs 232.778 is much easier to remember ;D
12-07-2019T13:08:54,TeapotOfDoom,Take this: 0°C: water freezes
12-07-2019T13:09:03,IronHorseComics,32 degrees
12-07-2019T13:09:04,TeapotOfDoom,100°C: water boils
12-07-2019T13:09:11,TeapotOfDoom,done
12-07-2019T13:09:20,AspiringNoodle,32 and 212 respectively
12-07-2019T13:09:20,Ordithus,Noodle
12-07-2019T13:09:25,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
12-07-2019T13:09:25,Ordithus,Just
12-07-2019T13:09:30,AspiringNoodle,Ord :p
12-07-2019T13:09:42,Ordithus,Celsius 233 would be the same ease
12-07-2019T13:09:47,TeapotOfDoom,25°C everything's cozy
12-07-2019T13:09:52,Ordithus,Don't double the digits
12-07-2019T13:09:54,AspiringNoodle,But paper doesn't combust at that point :c
12-07-2019T13:10:04,AspiringNoodle,Scratch that
12-07-2019T13:10:32,AspiringNoodle,Paper combusted a quarter of a degree ago <3
12-07-2019T13:10:49,TeapotOfDoom,Well if we're going for perfection
12-07-2019T13:10:52,TeapotOfDoom,Kelvin
12-07-2019T13:11:02,AspiringNoodle,"I guess it should be said, read Fahrenheit 451"
12-07-2019T13:11:02,IronHorseComics,"ehhh crank it down to 70 and then we're good, 75 with a nice breeze"
12-07-2019T13:11:04,AspiringNoodle,Really good book
12-07-2019T13:11:26,AspiringNoodle,"70F = 21C, 72F = 22C"
12-07-2019T13:11:36,IronHorseComics,"now I remember, I couldn't remember if that name was to a movie or something"
12-07-2019T13:11:38,AspiringNoodle,I think most people find 70 - 74F to be the most comfortable
12-07-2019T13:11:53,TeapotOfDoom,Standard lab temperature is 22C
12-07-2019T13:11:57,TeapotOfDoom,so yeah
12-07-2019T13:12:02,TeapotOfDoom,also in that ballpark
12-07-2019T13:12:19,TeapotOfDoom,Freedomheit
12-07-2019T13:13:29,TeapotOfDoom,(also why have i started a debate about metric vs imperial...)
12-07-2019T13:14:12,AspiringNoodle,Because for the most part it's the most random fucking system ever
12-07-2019T13:14:12,IronHorseComics,"also, Fahrenheit is German"
12-07-2019T13:14:38,IronHorseComics,kinda
12-07-2019T13:14:42,TeapotOfDoom,Metric or imperial noodle?
12-07-2019T13:14:47,AspiringNoodle,"That and I forgot to switch off CN before bed a few nights ago, and woke up to Teen Titans Go! doing an episode on imperial vs metric"
12-07-2019T13:14:50,TeapotOfDoom,Deutschland!
12-07-2019T13:14:59,TeapotOfDoom,ÖÖÖÖ
12-07-2019T13:15:02,AspiringNoodle,That show is just so cringey to begin with
12-07-2019T13:15:15,AspiringNoodle,But what's REALLY funny is that they had flow charts for both systems
12-07-2019T13:15:17,TeapotOfDoom,Lol really?
12-07-2019T13:15:23,IronHorseComics,it was made by a German immigrant
12-07-2019T13:15:33,AspiringNoodle,And Imperial was all over the effing place
12-07-2019T13:15:47,AspiringNoodle,"Looked like a scatter plot, or a conspiracy web some nutjob puts up on their wall"
12-07-2019T13:15:49,TeapotOfDoom,I know cause Britain
12-07-2019T13:16:21,AspiringNoodle,"That said, there are some imperial measurements that I don't mind."
12-07-2019T13:16:27,TeapotOfDoom,Like?
12-07-2019T13:16:30,AspiringNoodle,Main one being temperature :P
12-07-2019T13:16:46,TeapotOfDoom,Well I guess it's mostly being used to it
12-07-2019T13:17:02,AspiringNoodle,"I like knowing my normal / deadly bodily temperatures, thank you very much <3"
12-07-2019T13:17:13,AspiringNoodle,98.6 / 106 respectively
12-07-2019T13:17:32,TeapotOfDoom,38 and 42
12-07-2019T13:17:42,TeapotOfDoom,*36
12-07-2019T13:17:56,AspiringNoodle,"Nvm, that's super easy :D"
12-07-2019T13:18:40,TeapotOfDoom,well it's kinda just a random number ^^
12-07-2019T13:19:28,TeapotOfDoom,also if you want to get to Kelvin just add 273
12-07-2019T13:19:38,TeapotOfDoom,0°C=273°K
12-07-2019T13:19:47,IronHorseComics,"ah, 0 degrees fahrenheit is the freezing point of brine water, basically the saltiest of salt waters"
12-07-2019T13:19:47,TeapotOfDoom,100°C=373°K
12-07-2019T13:20:14,AspiringNoodle,Random topic switch:  Looking at rgb case fans
12-07-2019T13:20:16,IronHorseComics,32 F is the freezing of fresh water
12-07-2019T13:20:27,AspiringNoodle,"Imo, fans with 4 leds in the fan hub look ugly in terms of light"
12-07-2019T13:20:40,AspiringNoodle,6 / 8 minimum plz :p
12-07-2019T13:20:49,TeapotOfDoom,Well temperature scales are all over the place in general. Except the ones defined after we found out that it's absolute
12-07-2019T13:20:49,AspiringNoodle,Random stream?
12-07-2019T13:20:52,IronHorseComics,HEY! We're live1

12-07-2019T14:40:59,AspiringNoodle,Supposedly humans naturally have a polyphasic sleep cycle
12-07-2019T14:41:06,NextGenAnubisKid,See ya Bordem
12-07-2019T14:41:09,TubalTec,"I'm randomly here to check if other streams work, because I'm in another channel with problems"
12-07-2019T14:41:12,TeapotOfDoom,Bye Boredom
12-07-2019T14:41:17,AspiringNoodle,"A long night's sleep, followed by a quick rest period halfway through the day"
12-07-2019T14:41:17,TubalTec,just fyi :P
12-07-2019T14:41:21,Sclimshady,Bye Contagious
12-07-2019T14:41:22,BadFoMo,Cool.
12-07-2019T14:41:23,TubalTec,seems like a problem with picarto
12-07-2019T14:41:26,AspiringNoodle,"Yet society treats it as, ""you don't have enough energy!"""
12-07-2019T14:41:27,TeapotOfDoom,Oh you too?
12-07-2019T14:41:30,ZahnHolley,I rarely take naps. Not often just  rejuvenating  because the Toria lessons Chyna circulate my body that’s why am rejuvenating
12-07-2019T14:41:35,TeapotOfDoom,Both down for me
12-07-2019T14:41:42,NextGenAnubisKid,Streams are still up for me. Could be a regional server issue
12-07-2019T14:41:42,TubalTec,"anyway, good bye o/"
12-07-2019T14:41:55,Sclimshady,I still see Tom and Sage is just not doing anything but it works
12-07-2019T14:41:57,SageSaga,oh yeah- for those who havent seen it yet - Demon Slayer animation has some great use of 3D https://twitter.com/BLVCKxSTVR/status/1142905853105721344
12-07-2019T14:42:10,NextGenAnubisKid,Yeah I hear ya Noodle. It's annoying that people think that lol
12-07-2019T14:42:12,TeapotOfDoom,Good hint. I'll try a tunnel to the states
12-07-2019T14:42:26,IronHorseComics,I remember when I tried to open a picarto page by accident and I got a 504 error
12-07-2019T14:42:55,NextGenAnubisKid,Holy smokes that's great animation!
12-07-2019T14:43:00,ZahnHolley,Dance boys dance

12-07-2019T14:45:04,TeapotOfDoom,Who ever guessed that picarto has a local server outage was right
12-07-2019T14:45:12,FloofyCat,Its not just me?
12-07-2019T14:45:18,TeapotOfDoom,the us servers are slow for me but i can stream again
12-07-2019T14:45:30,FloofyCat,I thought it was Sunday and rushed to make food and derp its Saturday.
12-07-2019T14:45:34,Sclimshady,Welcome to America
12-07-2019T14:45:35,MisterWho,"Hmm, i'm getting a warning that i'm ""offline"" at that it'll try again in 10sec."
12-07-2019T14:45:39,TeapotOfDoom,europe servers seem to have problems

12-07-2019T14:46:52,FloofyCat,I came a day early but Tom is streaming anyway
12-07-2019T14:48:07,Sammit,Hi everybody
12-07-2019T14:48:12,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Sammy
12-07-2019T14:48:12,TeapotOfDoom,Hoia Sam
12-07-2019T14:48:26,Sclimshady,Hi Sammit
12-07-2019T14:48:28,NextGenAnubisKid,Hallo Sam!
12-07-2019T14:51:41,MisterWho,"Meh, i'm really really glad that there's a recording of every stream. Looks like europe is off the line atm. :((("
12-07-2019T14:51:48,NextGenAnubisKid,"Was going to sketch, then I remembered I need to prepare a one off D&D adventure for my roommate lol"
12-07-2019T14:52:05,TeapotOfDoom,Get a vpn who
12-07-2019T14:52:08,NextGenAnubisKid,Aww crap Who. Hope it gets back online soon!
12-07-2019T14:52:13,TeapotOfDoom,Totally worth it
12-07-2019T14:52:22,MisterWho,which provider do you use?
12-07-2019T14:52:26,TeapotOfDoom,PIA
12-07-2019T14:52:33,FloofyCat,You gunna need one if you're from the UK.
12-07-2019T14:52:36,TeapotOfDoom,but i'll be switching to nord soon
12-07-2019T14:53:00,TeapotOfDoom,pia's ips are blocked on more and more pages
12-07-2019T14:53:05,MisterWho,"okay, ah i've heared from north. Well..let's see..."
12-07-2019T14:54:18,STVL1X,"What software do you use tu draw, tom?"
12-07-2019T14:54:23,TeapotOfDoom,Yo who you gone? every time i try to dm you it says 404
12-07-2019T14:54:29,SageSaga,Tom uses Photoshop
12-07-2019T14:54:30,TeapotOfDoom,Photoshop
12-07-2019T14:55:11,STVL1X,Called it. Thanks
12-07-2019T14:56:06,NextGenAnubisKid,And I see you're using CSP EX Sage. How is that? I've been looking for drawing software for when I make that jump.
12-07-2019T14:56:15,MarvTheHugPharaoh,That ab lighting :weary::ok_hand:
12-07-2019T14:56:55,SageSaga,CSP is fantastic
12-07-2019T14:57:01,IronHorseComics,eeehhhhh
12-07-2019T14:57:08,IronHorseComics,I'm still not sold on it
12-07-2019T14:57:34,IronHorseComics,and I've been using it to do the sketches and panel setup
12-07-2019T14:58:05,BadFoMo,Clip Studio Pro?
12-07-2019T14:58:14,NextGenAnubisKid,Sage uses EX
12-07-2019T14:58:28,IronHorseComics,"one thing that drives me bonkers about it is that I set up a black swatch that's proper rich black, it keeps changing the color values of it for no reason"
12-07-2019T14:58:38,NextGenAnubisKid,Pro is an extra $180 and only adds animation capabilities
12-07-2019T14:58:44,NextGenAnubisKid,If I'm remembering correctly??
12-07-2019T14:58:44,SageSaga,it doesnt do that
12-07-2019T14:58:48,IronHorseComics,mine does
12-07-2019T14:59:02,SageSaga,no thats not true Anubiskid
12-07-2019T14:59:14,SageSaga,well you must have messed with your settings then
12-07-2019T14:59:37,IronHorseComics,"I did absolutely nothing to the settings, it keeps doing it on its own"
12-07-2019T14:59:43,NextGenAnubisKid,Woops my bad. ^^; Gonna recheck the site
12-07-2019T14:59:55,SageSaga,and im calling bullcrap on that- the program doesnt randomly change things
12-07-2019T15:00:03,kts,hello everyone!
12-07-2019T15:00:09,SageSaga,you probably just arent aware of what you did
12-07-2019T15:00:11,TeapotOfDoom,Hey mister k
12-07-2019T15:00:11,NextGenAnubisKid,Howdy KTS!
12-07-2019T15:00:24,Sammit,Hi Kts
12-07-2019T15:00:38,IronHorseComics,riiiiiight
12-07-2019T15:01:08,SageSaga,yeah - you know how dumb it would be for someone to program a professional art program that randomly changes settings without input?
12-07-2019T15:01:18,NextGenAnubisKid,"Oh, I had Pro and EX mixed up in my head."
12-07-2019T15:01:18,SageSaga,The more likely problem is the user
12-07-2019T15:01:27,TeapotOfDoom,As a programmer it would be really fung
12-07-2019T15:01:29,TeapotOfDoom,fun
12-07-2019T15:01:39,Rosscoe,Good evenings
12-07-2019T15:01:44,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Ross
12-07-2019T15:01:45,NextGenAnubisKid,Evening Rosscoe!
12-07-2019T15:01:48,TeapotOfDoom,Hoi Ross
12-07-2019T15:01:53,Sammit,Hi Ross
12-07-2019T15:01:59,Sclimshady,Hello Ross
12-07-2019T15:02:02,NextGenAnubisKid,"And yeah, I'll keep CSP on my radar. Thanks Sage!"
12-07-2019T15:02:02,Rosscoe,I get to sit down and watch SAGE for a change
12-07-2019T15:02:05,Rosscoe,yay
12-07-2019T15:02:17,MarvTheHugPharaoh,\o/
12-07-2019T15:02:26,kts,finally managed to find a stream that is not at 3:00 am xD
12-07-2019T15:02:29,IronHorseComics,"I'm telling you, every time I open that program that black has its values changed"
12-07-2019T15:02:32,Rosscoe,latest YOSH! fights been fun read
12-07-2019T15:02:37,IronHorseComics,it only does it to the black
12-07-2019T15:02:52,SageSaga,and im telling you that you probably have a setting or color profile changing it
12-07-2019T15:02:55,TeapotOfDoom,Iron check your color space
12-07-2019T15:03:05,ZahnHolley,“Do ya know da way?”
12-07-2019T15:03:12,SageSaga,the program as built doesnt just do that
12-07-2019T15:03:20,TeapotOfDoom,If you're changing from RGB to CMYK unintentionally this can happen
12-07-2019T15:03:32,IronHorseComics,but I WANT it to be CMYK
12-07-2019T15:03:38,SageSaga,so its something set on yours that needs to be corrected- its not an error of the program its a user problem
12-07-2019T15:03:53,TeapotOfDoom,I just remembered that that this can happen. I had it happen some time ago
12-07-2019T15:04:10,TeapotOfDoom,in Photoshop
12-07-2019T15:05:18,SageSaga,why are you working in CMYK anyways? Do you only do print work?
12-07-2019T15:05:57,SageSaga,heck even most people who do print work still work in RGB now
12-07-2019T15:05:58,IronHorseComics,I want to to be ready in case I DO decide to sell prints
12-07-2019T15:06:14,TeapotOfDoom,is hsb an option?
12-07-2019T15:06:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,RGB for life
12-07-2019T15:06:26,ZahnHolley,It really sucks to pay a monthly fee to adobe photoshop. All though it’s expensive to work with.
12-07-2019T15:06:39,SageSaga,welcome to the future then- you can convert from RBG to CMYK easily and many printers prefer it
12-07-2019T15:07:35,AspiringNoodle,CMYK can KMA ;)
12-07-2019T15:08:05,TeapotOfDoom,HSB = best option. change my mind
12-07-2019T15:08:07,AspiringNoodle,At least RGB matches human cone cells
12-07-2019T15:08:47,TeapotOfDoom,(tbh i really don't care for the choice of color space but technically hsb makes the most sense to me)
12-07-2019T15:09:18,IronHorseComics,okay let's look at the color conversion settings
12-07-2019T15:09:25,IronHorseComics,real quick here
12-07-2019T15:09:32,ZahnHolley,K
12-07-2019T15:09:40,TeapotOfDoom,We're looking
12-07-2019T15:10:00,IronHorseComics,RGB Profile: sRGB IEC61966-2.1
12-07-2019T15:10:18,IronHorseComics,CMYK Prifile: US Sheetfed Coated v2
12-07-2019T15:10:36,IronHorseComics,Rendering intent: Perceptual (may be the problem)
12-07-2019T15:10:48,IronHorseComics,Library in use: IccLibrary
12-07-2019T15:10:55,IronHorseComics,that's what my CSP is telling me
12-07-2019T15:11:53,CrimsonHelsing,Glad I could catch this stream! Hey everyone!
12-07-2019T15:12:02,NextGenAnubisKid,Hello Crimson!
12-07-2019T15:12:05,TeapotOfDoom,Hi Crimson
12-07-2019T15:12:14,Kullax,Good evening :ckullax-fortes:
12-07-2019T15:12:19,Sammit,Hi Crimson and Kullax
12-07-2019T15:12:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Kullax
12-07-2019T15:12:26,NextGenAnubisKid,Hello Kullax!
12-07-2019T15:12:27,TeapotOfDoom,Heya Kullax
12-07-2019T15:12:44,Sclimshady,"Hi Kullax, Crimson"
12-07-2019T15:13:03,IronHorseComics,see anything wrong there?
12-07-2019T15:13:22,TeapotOfDoom,Well tbh i dunno...
12-07-2019T15:13:41,TeapotOfDoom,like sage said i would use rgb anyway but your choice
12-07-2019T15:14:16,SageSaga,how do you have 2 color profiles at the same time?
12-07-2019T15:14:43,IronHorseComics,your guess is as good as mine
12-07-2019T15:14:43,TeapotOfDoom,Also my illustrator uses FOGRA39 as cmyk if that helps
12-07-2019T15:15:04,IronHorseComics,here let me get a screen shot so you can see the settings
12-07-2019T15:15:05,TeapotOfDoom,There are separate profiles for rgb and cmyk
12-07-2019T15:15:35,SageSaga,yeah but only one should be active so i dont know why he would list both
12-07-2019T15:16:31,TeapotOfDoom,Oh no stream died again
12-07-2019T15:16:40,TeapotOfDoom,Come on you can do it
12-07-2019T15:16:55,TeapotOfDoom,Load for heavens sake
12-07-2019T15:17:22,SageSaga,That's for converting to CMYK from RGB not your current settings
12-07-2019T15:17:57,SageSaga,seems like you might be working in RGB then saving as CMYK and wondering why your colors are changing
12-07-2019T15:18:35,IronHorseComics,"okay, how do I make the working and saving the same?"
12-07-2019T15:19:25,SageSaga,its been a while- my suggestion would be to only work in RGB and when you are planning to print do a conversion- but if you want to work in CMYK- give me a sec
12-07-2019T15:22:17,FloofyCat,Is there any benefits to using CMYK?
12-07-2019T15:22:26,TeapotOfDoom,Mostly no
12-07-2019T15:22:27,FloofyCat,What's the practical differences?
12-07-2019T15:22:48,IronHorseComics,for a while you didn't have to worry about your colors looking desaturated when it prints
12-07-2019T15:22:52,TeapotOfDoom,RBG defines color as a combination of a red green and blue channel
12-07-2019T15:22:58,SageSaga,never picking a non-CMYK friendly color is the only reason to work in it only
12-07-2019T15:23:24,Kullax,"I may be dump, but what's CMYK?"
12-07-2019T15:23:36,IronHorseComics,CMYK is the primary colors of ink
12-07-2019T15:23:43,SageSaga,Cyan Magenta Yellow and Black for printing
12-07-2019T15:23:44,IronHorseComics,"Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black"
12-07-2019T15:23:47,TeapotOfDoom,cmyk is cyan magenta yellow black
12-07-2019T15:23:48,Kullax,thanks! :P
12-07-2019T15:24:00,TeapotOfDoom,used mainly for printing
12-07-2019T15:24:20,SageSaga,yall see that?
12-07-2019T15:24:30,TeapotOfDoom,as it useses the actual color of the ink in a subtracitve manner instead of an additive one like rgb
12-07-2019T15:24:33,IronHorseComics,see what?
12-07-2019T15:24:36,SageSaga,the colors on screen are shifted for CMYK
12-07-2019T15:24:47,MarvTheHugPharaoh,they look dull
12-07-2019T15:25:04,IronHorseComics,yeah that's the sad truth of it
12-07-2019T15:25:05,SageSaga,this is RGB
12-07-2019T15:25:09,ZahnHolley,The background of toms panels looks fresh
12-07-2019T15:25:11,MarvTheHugPharaoh,now they are bright and happy again
12-07-2019T15:25:40,TeapotOfDoom,i wanna see
12-07-2019T15:26:00,TeapotOfDoom,ah yes picarto's back in europe
12-07-2019T15:27:12,SageSaga,not all colors are badly affected by CMYK though
12-07-2019T15:27:17,SageSaga,those are called safe colors
12-07-2019T15:27:39,TeapotOfDoom,tell me more
12-07-2019T15:27:45,Zdziwionykot,hello there everyone
12-07-2019T15:27:51,IronHorseComics,the CMYK settings on all art programs are safe colors
12-07-2019T15:27:56,NextGenAnubisKid,Hello!
12-07-2019T15:27:57,Sammit,Hi Zdz
12-07-2019T15:27:59,ZahnHolley,Hi man
12-07-2019T15:28:03,Sclimshady,Hi lots of letters
12-07-2019T15:28:06,TeapotOfDoom,Hi Z
12-07-2019T15:28:12,Zdziwionykot,xd
12-07-2019T15:28:14,IronHorseComics,though pantones are even better because they are the same for ALL printers
12-07-2019T15:28:20,TeapotOfDoom,I'm not even gonna try
12-07-2019T15:28:49,SageSaga,now- that said
12-07-2019T15:29:05,SageSaga,so long as you avoid SUPER HIGH CONTRAST colors in RGB they will mostly convert fine
12-07-2019T15:29:22,IronHorseComics,like that super bright cyan for example
12-07-2019T15:29:35,SageSaga,exactly
12-07-2019T15:30:07,IronHorseComics,"I've found a few good mixes for a decent blue color, I use C100 M: 60-80 for it"
12-07-2019T15:31:18,IronHorseComics,one thing to note with 100% black is that it doesn't look as dark as it should...depending on the printer
12-07-2019T15:31:58,IronHorseComics,"rich black makes it look super deep and as the name implies, rich"
12-07-2019T15:32:57,IronHorseComics,"oh yeah Sage, you don't have to keep looking for how to change the settings for the color, I'll just do what I had been, selecting all the black with photoshop and fill it in with the rich black I like because that's the default"
12-07-2019T15:33:24,SageSaga,got a phone
12-07-2019T15:34:06,SageSaga,call

12-07-2019T15:42:03,TeapotOfDoom,I mean i know and have been to some places where you're paying 70 upwards for TWO PEOPLE but for one person
12-07-2019T15:42:05,AspiringNoodle,"If you like cheap / trashy, I'm your noodle"

12-07-2019T15:42:35,MatyMaty,Neko always talks so much about that steakhouse XD
12-07-2019T15:42:36,SageSaga,anyone who thought that was good needs to go to a different steakhouse
12-07-2019T15:42:50,SageSaga,actually - Ron likes the one by me the most
12-07-2019T15:42:50,Rosscoe,Was it Chef Ramsey mockery bad?
12-07-2019T15:42:50,IronHorseComics,"anyways, I'll BRB, gotta get food"
12-07-2019T15:42:53,AspiringNoodle,"I thought you'd say ""get slapped with a steak"""
12-07-2019T15:42:56,SageSaga,he wasnt thrilled with this one either

12-07-2019T15:43:24,SageSaga,the one by me is also CHEAP for a Brazilian Steak House
12-07-2019T15:43:32,MatyMaty,with the swords?
12-07-2019T15:43:32,FloofyCat,I have yet to eat a steak once in my life.
12-07-2019T15:43:35,SageSaga,yes

12-07-2019T15:43:46,AspiringNoodle,"Floofy, you ain't missing much :P"
12-07-2019T15:43:48,FloofyCat,"I live on top of a Brazillian restaurant, at least for like three more weeks."
12-07-2019T15:44:00,AspiringNoodle,"Steak is good every once and a while, but it's kinda meh"
12-07-2019T15:44:00,FloofyCat,Pretty pricey but not that pricey.
12-07-2019T15:44:13,SageSaga,the one by me is only 20 per person
12-07-2019T15:44:15,Sclimshady,You take that back Noodle

12-07-2019T15:44:41,SageSaga,and this one was 60 Fugo De Chow or whatever its called
12-07-2019T15:44:45,Rosscoe,"Maty, I have sea food all over the province, JOIN MEH :D"
12-07-2019T15:44:51,AspiringNoodle,"Oh, I've tasted really good steak, I just prefer chicken / seafood for a regular diet :P"
12-07-2019T15:44:57,FloofyCat,Or just make pizza constantly and its like a quarter of the price of ordering one at somewhere cheap.
12-07-2019T15:44:58,Sclimshady,I sear mine in homade garlic butter and pepper
12-07-2019T15:45:11,TeapotOfDoom,Well yea for regular stuff but still

12-07-2019T15:46:11,FloofyCat,"When it costs like £2 to make yourself stuffed crust 9"" garlic bread pizza with cheese and everything, why pay for a steak?"

12-07-2019T15:47:16,AspiringNoodle,Beans were more expensive per pound than lobster
12-07-2019T15:47:17,TraceLegacyXI,Hey anubis
12-07-2019T15:47:21,Nekonny,"It was alright, the service was lousy"

12-07-2019T15:47:46,AspiringNoodle,Lobster is considered fancy food because of 2 reasons
12-07-2019T15:47:48,Nekonny,Mind if I join in sage?
12-07-2019T15:47:52,AspiringNoodle,Scarcity and marketing
12-07-2019T15:47:55,TraceLegacyXI,I’ve never had lobster

12-07-2019T15:47:59,SageSaga,when you are a waiter/waitress you dont blame others for your mistakes
12-07-2019T15:48:03,TraceLegacyXI,"In fact, I’ve never had shrimp either"
12-07-2019T15:48:07,Nekonny,exactly
12-07-2019T15:48:10,MatyMaty,crab is nicer than lobster
12-07-2019T15:48:13,AspiringNoodle,^

12-07-2019T15:48:17,Nekonny,they were saying the cook didn't want to be a cook
12-07-2019T15:48:18,MatyMaty,and shrimp is better than crab

12-07-2019T15:48:27,AspiringNoodle,Crab is more flavorful than lobster
12-07-2019T15:48:31,NextGenAnubisKid,Wouldn't ever blame others for my screw ups lol
