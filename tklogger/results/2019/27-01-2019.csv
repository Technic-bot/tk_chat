27-01-2019T00:19:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Do you need to use the sleep
27-01-2019T00:25:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Use sleep
27-01-2019T00:46:09,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
27-01-2019T00:54:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Can someone els find the problem with this headline and explain how it got past everyone: man locked inside 24 Hour Fitness after closing
27-01-2019T00:56:24,Bgrmystr2,I can assume one of two things.
27-01-2019T00:56:36,Bgrmystr2,"One, the guy was locked in accidentally"
27-01-2019T00:56:49,Bgrmystr2,"or two, the guy got himself locked in on purpose and played victim"
27-01-2019T00:57:20,Bgrmystr2,"because the person who locks the door can't possibly lock themselves out, they have the key"
27-01-2019T00:57:36,Bgrmystr2,unless he locks the door and then goes inside for something and the door shuts on his dumbass..
27-01-2019T00:57:53,Bgrmystr2,but at that point he's just an idiot and shouldn't be closing anyway. :U
27-01-2019T00:58:06,Bgrmystr2,I can't think of anything else that would explain such a title
27-01-2019T00:58:46,SpazztasticKiwi,I know someone who got their bank key locked in the deposit box
27-01-2019T00:58:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Which jammed it
27-01-2019T00:59:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Nite Tom

27-01-2019T01:01:51,Twokinds,You're more on the ball than Alexa sometimes
27-01-2019T01:04:07,Bgrmystr2,"Tellin ya, Kiwi should be your Alexa."
27-01-2019T01:07:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Too far away. I‚Äôm sure Alexa suits him better anyway
27-01-2019T01:41:21,Bgrmystr2,I mean.. someone keeping tom on task that isn't Alexa.. someone who actually can judge whether something is a good or bad idea..
27-01-2019T01:41:26,Bgrmystr2,that'd be useful for tom imo
27-01-2019T01:41:41,Bgrmystr2,alexa is just a clock timer..
27-01-2019T01:46:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Ok yeah sure I‚Äôll be the rando following him around to poke him with a reminder every ten minutes
27-01-2019T01:46:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm sure that won‚Äôt get the police involved
27-01-2019T01:46:42,Bgrmystr2,fuck. That video is still my favorite of his.
27-01-2019T01:47:15,Bgrmystr2,I jumped in at like 3 mins and gave it two mins and I already can't breathe
27-01-2019T01:47:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh and if you‚Äôre interested in watching a video of Se√°n‚Äôs try the latest funniest home videos

27-01-2019T01:48:42,SpazztasticKiwi,You mean his drum cover?

27-01-2019T06:38:15,Bgrmystr2,yeah shipping for something like that.. it'd be fairly heavy and fairly large
27-01-2019T06:38:18,ThingsAreMoving,Why can't we have teleports already. Moving stuff around the world is too damn expensive
27-01-2019T06:38:43,Bgrmystr2,but I guess since you're not in the US you couldn't just... ground shipping :V
27-01-2019T06:39:08,ThingsAreMoving,like... through a regular post office?
27-01-2019T06:39:47,ThingsAreMoving,doubt that'd beat the price of a company that actually handles international transport
27-01-2019T06:39:50,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, or through like UPS or Fedex, ground shipping is much cheaper than something like import air mail from another country"
27-01-2019T06:40:58,ThingsAreMoving,"I've compared prices of UPS, DPD, Fedex and TNT express"
27-01-2019T06:40:58,Bgrmystr2,"shipping from japan to here is like $40+ just for a figure, and shipping to Sweden for a box of foodstuffs is about $50-60 I believe, depending on weight, could be low 40s or less.. but yeah still expensive"
27-01-2019T06:41:34,Bgrmystr2,"we can ship stuff from state to state for less than $20 for the most part, hell, most of the time I pay less than $10 for shipping"
27-01-2019T06:41:44,ThingsAreMoving,well that thing weighs 7.5kg sooo... ~16.5lbs
27-01-2019T06:41:50,Bgrmystr2,yeah.
27-01-2019T06:42:18,Bgrmystr2,"weight and size would be issue, unfortunately. :("
27-01-2019T06:42:32,ThingsAreMoving,"yup, it's almost the same cos as a new one on newegg"

27-01-2019T16:55:43,CrimsonQuill,Sweetcorn goes really well in a bolognese sauce.
27-01-2019T16:55:48,CrimsonQuill,I put it in all the time.
27-01-2019T16:55:56,CrimsonQuill,And it really helps bulk it up.
27-01-2019T16:56:04,ThingsAreMoving,like... mashed corn kernels?

27-01-2019T17:13:23,CrimsonQuill,Ah.
27-01-2019T17:13:26,CrimsonQuill,Cats are nice.
27-01-2019T17:13:45,Bgrmystr2,We had this conversation a while ago and then shenanigans happened and I think you were under the wrong impression
27-01-2019T17:13:55,Bgrmystr2,so I wanted to ask but every time I would remember when I woke up..
27-01-2019T17:13:59,Bgrmystr2,you already went to sleep
27-01-2019T17:14:01,ThingsAreMoving,...that was two weeks ago
27-01-2019T17:14:02,CrimsonQuill,Probably. I generally catch the wrong end of the stick.
27-01-2019T17:14:06,Bgrmystr2,"yes it was, things."
27-01-2019T17:14:06,ThingsAreMoving,jeezis bgr
27-01-2019T17:14:13,CrimsonQuill,And my time zones are awful.

27-01-2019T17:14:23,CrimsonQuill,"So, no, I don't think of Holly as a hamster."
27-01-2019T17:14:29,Bgrmystr2,Good
27-01-2019T17:14:34,CrimsonQuill,"If Holly is a cat, then she is a cat."
27-01-2019T17:14:37,ThingsAreMoving,"No need for all cap typing, old man"
27-01-2019T17:14:58,Bgrmystr2,"imma whoppa you with mah cane, ya lil whippersnapper :V"
27-01-2019T17:15:10,CrimsonQuill,"Hey, Brg, were you there when Tom sketched the Halfkind girl?"
27-01-2019T17:15:15,CrimsonQuill,I can't rememer
27-01-2019T17:15:15,Bgrmystr2,yes
27-01-2019T17:15:17,CrimsonQuill,Ah.
27-01-2019T17:15:31,CrimsonQuill,Then you'll remember my name suggestion was already taken.
27-01-2019T17:15:40,ThingsAreMoving,"You're only two weeks older than me, ya limp biscuit"
27-01-2019T17:15:49,Bgrmystr2,I'm sure tom already had a name for her
27-01-2019T17:15:56,Bgrmystr2,that was wayyyy before twokinds
27-01-2019T17:16:01,Bgrmystr2,long time ago
27-01-2019T17:16:11,CrimsonQuill,I still am a bit surprised that Tom had a character named Willow. I was certain that the cat would have a unique name.
27-01-2019T17:16:12,ThingsAreMoving,I think you tried Willow.
27-01-2019T17:16:17,CrimsonQuill,Yep.
27-01-2019T17:16:22,CrimsonQuill,My aunt's cat.
27-01-2019T17:16:31,CrimsonQuill,And I had the hubris to link a picture of her.
27-01-2019T17:16:39,ThingsAreMoving,Willow is the emo cat if I recall correctly.
27-01-2019T17:16:46,Bgrmystr2,Strange name for a person honestly.
27-01-2019T17:16:47,CrimsonQuill,'Emo cat?'
27-01-2019T17:16:57,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, something tom showed on stream"
27-01-2019T17:17:01,CrimsonQuill,I remember that.
27-01-2019T17:17:05,ThingsAreMoving,Well Tom showed us some concept arts for various characters
27-01-2019T17:17:09,CrimsonQuill,I hope some time he posts those concepts.
27-01-2019T17:17:14,ThingsAreMoving,And Willow was the emo cat
27-01-2019T17:17:16,CrimsonQuill,Because they were just awesome.
27-01-2019T17:17:47,CrimsonQuill,'Willow Wisp'
27-01-2019T17:17:50,CrimsonQuill,That was the name
27-01-2019T17:24:37,CrimsonQuill,Shoot.

27-01-2019T20:02:03,Ordithus,How hot is it there?
27-01-2019T20:03:01,unsteddyphoenix,82F
27-01-2019T20:03:09,Ordithus,"Warm, but not so bad"

27-01-2019T20:03:21,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah but im not used to it
27-01-2019T20:03:36,Ordithus,"So, would you rather have +82 F or -32 F?"
27-01-2019T20:03:37,unsteddyphoenix,Yall with your 100F states that are essentially on fire all the time
27-01-2019T20:03:55,ThingsAreMoving,"wait, what kind of temperatures do you normally deal with over there, kiwibro?"
27-01-2019T20:04:11,Ordithus,He probably doesn't know anything outside of 55 to 85 F
27-01-2019T20:04:19,Ordithus,:ptv-snicker:
27-01-2019T20:04:19,unsteddyphoenix,Uh isnt -32f like far below freezing
27-01-2019T20:04:23,Ordithus,Very
27-01-2019T20:04:30,Ordithus,"64 degrees, in fact"
27-01-2019T20:04:42,unsteddyphoenix,I'd say we get as low as 40f
27-01-2019T20:04:53,ThingsAreMoving,"-32F... I only experienced this kind of temperature once, or twice"
27-01-2019T20:04:54,Ordithus,It is -36 C for ya
27-01-2019T20:05:09,unsteddyphoenix,"Lotsa snow, at least! :D"
27-01-2019T20:05:14,Ordithus,Too cold to snow
27-01-2019T20:05:20,ThingsAreMoving,yup
27-01-2019T20:06:04,ThingsAreMoving,but most lakes should freeze over in those temperatures
27-01-2019T20:06:08,unsteddyphoenix,:thinking:
27-01-2019T20:06:13,unsteddyphoenix,How does that work
27-01-2019T20:06:16,ThingsAreMoving,two weeks and ice skating is a go
27-01-2019T20:06:26,Ordithus,Lake Superior won't freeze over just yet
27-01-2019T20:06:38,Ordithus,"If it does, that's usually in early March"
27-01-2019T20:06:51,ThingsAreMoving,"I'm talking about real lakes, not those monstrosities you have over there"
27-01-2019T20:06:58,ThingsAreMoving,"those are seas, not lakes"
27-01-2019T20:06:58,Ordithus,Haha
27-01-2019T20:07:04,Ordithus,Accurate
27-01-2019T20:07:18,Ordithus,All the inland lakes will be iced over by now
27-01-2019T20:08:16,Ordithus,"It's too cold to snow because when the air is that cold, it cannot retain any moisture"
27-01-2019T20:08:31,unsteddyphoenix,Huh.
27-01-2019T20:08:38,Ordithus,Days that cold usually have very clear skies
27-01-2019T20:08:41,unsteddyphoenix,So no ice no snow?
27-01-2019T20:09:03,ThingsAreMoving,all the moisture just crystallizes on everything around at some point
27-01-2019T20:09:10,ThingsAreMoving,and it's beautiful
27-01-2019T20:09:43,ThingsAreMoving,just look up hoar frost
27-01-2019T20:09:44,Ordithus,I forget about when spit will freeze before it hits the ground
27-01-2019T20:10:26,unsteddyphoenix,Woah
27-01-2019T20:10:35,unsteddyphoenix,I kind of want to experience that
27-01-2019T20:10:44,unsteddyphoenix,It'll prolly get old after like 5 minutes but still
27-01-2019T20:11:03,ThingsAreMoving,Well to me it never does.

27-01-2019T20:15:04,Ordithus,Not enough for a car

27-01-2019T20:18:57,ThingsAreMoving,I suppose the cables would give out a similar sound

27-01-2019T21:21:24,Twokinds,Working on Twokinds stuff. The usual.
27-01-2019T21:21:24,RimaDraws,that is good. those color arts turned out great
27-01-2019T21:21:28,Twokinds,Thanks!
27-01-2019T21:21:31,Twokinds,I'm working on those
27-01-2019T21:21:31,RimaDraws,^^
27-01-2019T21:21:33,Twokinds,Adding backgrounds
27-01-2019T21:21:47,RimaDraws,oh neato. i cant wait to see tank mechanic natani finished.
27-01-2019T21:21:50,unsteddyphoenix,Drawing a tank?
27-01-2019T21:21:57,unsteddyphoenix,Ooh yeah love that one
27-01-2019T21:22:06,RimaDraws,speakin of which. i need to draw some more TK art
27-01-2019T21:22:08,Twokinds,Yeah still gotta find a model for the tank
27-01-2019T21:22:21,Twokinds,Gunna try finding a 3D one that I can just put in and paint over
27-01-2019T21:22:32,unsteddyphoenix,Ahh like you did with Rose's sword
27-01-2019T21:22:38,Twokinds,Yeah
27-01-2019T21:22:39,RimaDraws,ohhh
27-01-2019T21:22:44,Twokinds,It's just easier that way.
27-01-2019T21:22:54,unsteddyphoenix,"Clever, clever."
27-01-2019T21:23:04,unsteddyphoenix,Ive kinda thought like. 3D models must be good for reference?
27-01-2019T21:23:11,unsteddyphoenix,With the right software you can pose them how you want
27-01-2019T21:23:55,unsteddyphoenix,I guess that's like those little skeletal models you can buy
27-01-2019T21:24:17,RimaDraws,i got an idea i wanna draw with roselyn. go off the one suggestion i did a while back of her but make her human. for funsies
27-01-2019T21:24:34,Twokinds,I usually use google sketchup or sketchfab
27-01-2019T21:24:45,Twokinds,Really easy to just pull up a model online that way and take a screenshot
27-01-2019T21:25:43,RimaDraws,i just cant wait to see it finished. it's going to look great. i honestly am surprised about the body swap one winning
27-01-2019T21:25:52,Twokinds,Me too!
27-01-2019T21:26:09,RimaDraws,i thought either basitin euchre or reni in the bushes would win
27-01-2019T21:26:12,unsteddyphoenix,"Keith and Natani, man."
27-01-2019T21:26:26,unsteddyphoenix,Ahh so thats how you do it.
27-01-2019T21:26:44,RimaDraws,i now know what i would nora card if i had a chance
27-01-2019T21:27:13,unsteddyphoenix,Theres quite a few I would Nora
27-01-2019T21:27:25,RimaDraws,i got a list i could pick from but only one or two
27-01-2019T21:27:37,RimaDraws,some of the ones i wanted to got nora carded already
27-01-2019T21:27:52,unsteddyphoenix,Thats good!
27-01-2019T21:28:12,unsteddyphoenix,Sadly the older ones seem to get overlooked sometimes in the nora carders eyes
27-01-2019T21:28:16,RimaDraws,yea the one of natani in the laundry basket already got colored
27-01-2019T21:28:18,unsteddyphoenix,Theres some great ones back there
27-01-2019T21:28:20,RimaDraws,that was one
27-01-2019T21:28:40,RimaDraws,another was zen and natani in the bar while he was watching kat
27-01-2019T21:28:45,RimaDraws,that one is colored
27-01-2019T21:29:49,unsteddyphoenix,Sadly the main drunk kat one wasnt coloured as well~
27-01-2019T21:30:00,RimaDraws,i mean i could pick it but
27-01-2019T21:30:23,unsteddyphoenix,If you have a spare $200 lying around...
