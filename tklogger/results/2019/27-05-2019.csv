27-05-2019T04:41:02,Bgrmystr2,Nice hat :ok_hand:
27-05-2019T05:40:44,FloofyCat,"Found a decent job offer I can apply for, I just hope for all that is holy I don't get Sunday shifts during sketch streams :p"
27-05-2019T05:41:48,FloofyCat,"Hey Tom, are we going to do big poll votes from now on?"
27-05-2019T05:42:48,CrimsonQuill,Good Day everyone.

27-05-2019T09:01:56,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-hearts:
27-05-2019T09:02:42,CrimsonQuill,Just had a shower after power washing the stairs.
27-05-2019T09:03:05,CrimsonQuill,One would not believe the amount of muck on the paving slabs. They were filthy.
27-05-2019T09:08:45,AspiringNoodle,"Even though I live a decently nice area, most buildings look like they needed to power wash the sides for 10+ years xD"
27-05-2019T09:09:13,CrimsonQuill,My dad told me that the machine could rip my bare skin off if I pointed it at myself.
27-05-2019T09:09:23,CrimsonQuill,"Seeing it tear through the grime, I see his point."
27-05-2019T09:09:34,CrimsonQuill,There's lots of work outside to do....
27-05-2019T09:10:44,AspiringNoodle,"He shoulda set up a ""fun"" demo"
27-05-2019T09:10:57,AspiringNoodle,"Get a chicken breast, hang it off something, blast it with the power washer :D"
27-05-2019T09:11:14,CrimsonQuill,Waste of good food if you ask me.
27-05-2019T09:11:20,CrimsonQuill,"Besides, I take his word for it."
27-05-2019T09:11:22,AspiringNoodle,"*boom*, traumatized AND know how dangerous the thing is ^^"
27-05-2019T09:11:37,CrimsonQuill,Its common sense not to point a power washer at one's foot.
27-05-2019T09:11:55,AspiringNoodle,Common sense?  What's that?  Some kind of fancy spice?
27-05-2019T09:12:00,CrimsonQuill,"He showed me by pointing it at a particulary grimy slab, and washing it."
27-05-2019T09:12:11,CrimsonQuill,The muck flew in gobs.
27-05-2019T09:12:16,CrimsonQuill,Lesson learned.
27-05-2019T09:12:22,CrimsonQuill,And no chicken wasted.
27-05-2019T09:12:23,CrimsonQuill,:)
27-05-2019T09:27:59,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
27-05-2019T09:41:32,TerraTheWizard,when you have a dream about totally mundane stuff
27-05-2019T09:41:45,TerraTheWizard,suddenly remember it in the middle of the day
27-05-2019T09:41:56,TerraTheWizard,then spend 10 minutes confused as to if it actually happened
27-05-2019T09:58:21,CrimsonQuill,I know the feeling.
27-05-2019T09:58:32,CrimsonQuill,"At least, the few times I remember my dreams."
27-05-2019T10:20:48,AspiringNoodle,"I typically either don't dream, have movie-worthy dreams.  Or am trying to fall asleep in bed with random thoughts racing."
27-05-2019T10:21:20,AspiringNoodle,"And said thoughts are pissing me off, but when I become aware of the situation, I sit up in bed confused and irritated, and can't even remember what said thoughts were"
27-05-2019T10:21:39,AspiringNoodle,Which makes it even more irritating!
27-05-2019T10:22:34,AspiringNoodle,Random aside:  I have 3 dreams that I remember which are illustration worthy
27-05-2019T10:34:15,CrimsonQuill,Cool
27-05-2019T10:56:31,AspiringNoodle,"Quill, what's the weirdest dream you ever had?"
27-05-2019T10:56:40,CrimsonQuill,Ummm...
27-05-2019T10:56:44,CrimsonQuill,I can't really remember...
27-05-2019T11:00:10,CrimsonQuill,"Heck, I don't really remember my dreams."

27-05-2019T11:12:29,AspiringNoodle,And it took PS how many years to add a symmetry tool? xD
27-05-2019T16:29:52,AspiringNoodle,WOO!
27-05-2019T16:29:57,AspiringNoodle,RAIN FOR THE NEXT 3 DAYS!
27-05-2019T16:30:11,AspiringNoodle,"With a healthy dose of thunder and lightning, too!"
27-05-2019T16:30:21,Bgrmystr2,Very very frightening?

27-05-2019T19:06:53,AspiringNoodle,I learned the secret to watching super-long videos about legal jargon.
27-05-2019T19:07:08,AspiringNoodle,Up the playback to 1.5. :ptv-laugh:
27-05-2019T21:14:09,AspiringNoodle,Today's storms seem to all be going south of me. :ptv-pouty:
27-05-2019T21:14:19,AspiringNoodle,"Anyone else get to ""enjoy"" some bad weather today?"
27-05-2019T21:28:06,FloofyCat,"I was! It wasn't even bad, just very heavy rain which was great, it was nice and cool and really awesome."
27-05-2019T21:31:48,AspiringNoodle,Jealous :ptv-unimpressed:
27-05-2019T21:44:24,FloofyCat,"Well we've got heat waves forecasted so I woudln't be too jealous. :p Also it barely rains here and once it does, its the tiniest little sprinkle that doesn't even make you wet."
27-05-2019T21:50:13,AspiringNoodle,I live in a fun state that gets very wet at various times of year
27-05-2019T21:50:22,AspiringNoodle,"So if it's green and wet, I'm happy ^^"
27-05-2019T21:55:18,AspiringNoodle,"Well, except when I need to mow the lawn... At which point it better have been sunny and warm the past few days."
27-05-2019T22:29:00,AspiringNoodle,Thunder... why do you tease me so???
27-05-2019T22:31:38,AspiringNoodle,"...I HEAR RAIN, HALLELUJER!!!"
