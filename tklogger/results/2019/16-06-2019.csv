16-06-2019T00:00:25,Bgrmystr2,I mean.. I'd wonder why they didn't unarm him when they found him..
16-06-2019T00:00:36,AspiringNoodle,Fucking Chris Kyle'd man...
16-06-2019T00:02:02,Dadrobit,Police were aware of the bulge on the man's hip only after he got off the bus. It was them questioning him about the potential gun which set the man off.
16-06-2019T00:02:44,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-sad:
16-06-2019T00:04:35,AspiringNoodle,I look forward to building this new computer...
16-06-2019T00:05:12,AspiringNoodle,And maybe I'll start building computers for other people
16-06-2019T00:05:34,AspiringNoodle,"(Trying to turn the mood around, sorry for the awkward transition ^^;)"

16-06-2019T00:15:42,SpazztasticKiwi,not that I send much than cat pics to steddy
16-06-2019T00:17:24,AspiringNoodle,"When i find my art skills acceptable enough that I'm willing to post stuff online, I'll change my name"

16-06-2019T00:21:46,SpazztasticKiwi,tis a conversation with me
16-06-2019T00:21:55,SpazztasticKiwi,in a nutshell
16-06-2019T00:22:50,AspiringNoodle,"Computers, movies, anime, games, maybe the occasional western cartoon / show."
16-06-2019T00:22:54,Bgrmystr2,wot about me? :thinking:
16-06-2019T00:23:04,AspiringNoodle,What about you? :ptv-snicker:
16-06-2019T00:23:12,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-unimpressed: wow
16-06-2019T00:23:19,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-hearts:

16-06-2019T00:24:00,Bgrmystr2,"well I mean, yeah I expect no less :P"
16-06-2019T00:24:35,SpazztasticKiwi,you want cat pictures?
16-06-2019T00:24:50,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, I probably not really."
16-06-2019T00:24:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Also I tend to not send if I’m not sure the person has notifications and such on
16-06-2019T00:25:12,Bgrmystr2,"cats are d'aw, but it's like.. okay, picture of cat. now what? lol"
16-06-2019T00:25:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Cause I will send stupid at like 5 am if I’m up and find it
16-06-2019T00:25:19,Bgrmystr2,and ain't gotta worry about me
16-06-2019T00:25:36,Bgrmystr2,I'm up till like 6 or 7am then sleep like a rock.
16-06-2019T00:25:56,SpazztasticKiwi,alrighty then consider yourself added to the odd conversation
16-06-2019T00:26:04,SpazztasticKiwi,I hope you can ping pong topics
16-06-2019T00:26:13,AspiringNoodle,"I might stay up until 3 today, at worst xD"
16-06-2019T00:26:27,AspiringNoodle,I'm gonna find out if I'm one of those people who can live on 4 hours of sleep or die trying.
16-06-2019T00:26:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I go in at 12:15 but it’s not like I have much of a sleep schedule
16-06-2019T00:26:47,AspiringNoodle,You know my pain
16-06-2019T00:27:11,AspiringNoodle,"Rest of the world: Wake up early, adhere to strict schedule"
16-06-2019T00:27:25,AspiringNoodle,"Us: Ugh, what time is it?  Why does everything close so early..."
16-06-2019T00:27:55,Bgrmystr2,"I don't know if I can ping pong topics, but if I'm bad at it, I accept that."
16-06-2019T00:29:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"I other words, I can go from “look at this idiot parking” to “think ants can jump” in the same breath"
16-06-2019T00:29:19,AspiringNoodle,"Hmmmm, maybe I should be a bartender"
16-06-2019T00:29:30,AspiringNoodle,They get to stay up late :P
16-06-2019T00:30:53,Bgrmystr2,they gotta make judgement calls and deal with drunks
16-06-2019T00:31:03,Bgrmystr2,and deny angry drunk people more alchohol
16-06-2019T00:31:15,Bgrmystr2,it ain't gonna be easy lol
16-06-2019T00:31:30,AspiringNoodle,But also real pay potential
16-06-2019T00:39:22,SpazztasticKiwi,horror story: you just had a nice little night with your darling and three of your friends decide to bust in cause it’s time to leave
16-06-2019T00:39:32,SpazztasticKiwi,I would just have to die on spot
16-06-2019T00:42:22,Bgrmystr2,"""It's time to leave"" Leave and go where?"
16-06-2019T00:42:38,Bgrmystr2,I don't understand the context of where this would be bad xD
16-06-2019T00:43:12,SpazztasticKiwi,more on the short story I just finished hotel room. They go looking for guy
16-06-2019T00:43:19,SpazztasticKiwi,and walk in on some things
16-06-2019T00:43:28,SpazztasticKiwi,bless that girl
16-06-2019T00:44:03,Bgrmystr2,ahh okay
16-06-2019T00:44:18,Bgrmystr2,"well, that's partially the couple's fault for not locking the door anyway"
16-06-2019T00:44:36,SpazztasticKiwi,it was. They had the spare
16-06-2019T00:44:55,SpazztasticKiwi,because everyone was SUPPOSED to be in their own rooms
16-06-2019T00:45:37,Bgrmystr2,then that's their own fault for walkin in. Always knock even if you have a key
16-06-2019T00:46:25,SpazztasticKiwi,~Panic! at the Disco plays distantly~
16-06-2019T00:50:55,AspiringNoodle,Pffft

16-06-2019T21:53:48,AspiringNoodle,Hello Rima:D
16-06-2019T21:54:02,RimaDraws,hiiii noodle!
16-06-2019T21:54:26,AspiringNoodle,I finally stopped procrastinating and started checking out CSP and Affinity Photo
16-06-2019T21:54:44,AspiringNoodle,My computer is not ready for Affinity Photo ._.
16-06-2019T21:55:51,RimaDraws,oooh . i am drawing on CSP now
16-06-2019T21:56:35,AspiringNoodle,First thing that bummed me out about Affinity Photo: No inking brush available by default.  Had to make one.
16-06-2019T21:56:57,AspiringNoodle,"Like, whyyyyyyyyyyyyyy"
16-06-2019T22:06:55,AspiringNoodle,Second is definitely that it CHUUUUUUUUGS
16-06-2019T22:07:26,AspiringNoodle,"Not entirely sure if that's related to my CPU or if it's the lack of a GPU in my computer, tbh :/"
16-06-2019T22:11:21,RimaDraws,aw nuuuu

16-06-2019T23:12:57,metalman20,i missed all the fun conversations again didn't I
16-06-2019T23:40:50,Dadrobit,"Oof, dude who was working before me made microwave popcorn, and now my guard house smells like the dollar theatre."
16-06-2019T23:41:08,AspiringNoodle,Ha
16-06-2019T23:44:53,metalman20,"oh god well does it smell good at least, i mean popcorn can smell pretty good"
16-06-2019T23:45:17,AspiringNoodle,Don't make me think about food xD
16-06-2019T23:45:29,AspiringNoodle,I have a hard enough time trying to control my hunger.
16-06-2019T23:45:49,metalman20,oops sorry noodle lol
16-06-2019T23:46:47,AspiringNoodle,I wonder if my body is just trained to be hungry if I'm not super engaged or something
16-06-2019T23:47:58,Dadrobit,Popcorn only smells good when you get to eat it. Not when you have to work around it. I just have to sit here and steep in it for the next 8+ hours.
16-06-2019T23:48:36,Dadrobit,Now I'm just waiting for a reason to go out on a patrol.
16-06-2019T23:48:51,AspiringNoodle,RIP
16-06-2019T23:49:06,metalman20,ouch sorry robit.  i'm sure you'll get to go on patrol soon
