13-12-2019T00:03:01,BadFoMo,I've also seen The Ani-Matrix and ...that same thing but with Halo.
13-12-2019T00:03:03,Dadrobit,They were very proud of their innovation in recording all of the soundtrack well in advance and then being able to cut and splice their music using their Macintosh Computers.

13-12-2019T00:26:05,CrimsonHelsing,"Hey @TwoKinds, this may be pretty darn late to ask, but when Trace mentioned he might propose since everyone is there, was he meaning he wants to do that in front of everyone, or simply have everyone invited to the ceremony later? If that's spoilers then"
13-12-2019T00:26:10,CrimsonHelsing,I won't ask further
13-12-2019T00:26:37,MuonNeutrino,i doubt he'd reveal that until it happens

13-12-2019T00:27:10,CrimsonHelsing,No problem with that
13-12-2019T00:27:50,Ordithus,Sythe has his ways of breaking down Maren's shell.  She can't go one minute around him without getting all flustered

13-12-2019T02:25:12,SageSaga,saying something contains tropes shouldnt be seen as a negative thing
13-12-2019T02:25:18,ZRO4825,Depends on if he's got the 18+ DLC installed. XD
13-12-2019T02:25:18,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"You want a copy, W0lfy"
13-12-2019T02:25:44,SageSaga,now relying on tropes is a bad thing usually- but containing them just means it's a story- everything has tropes
13-12-2019T02:26:16,ZRO4825,"Personally I agree with you, Sage~"
13-12-2019T02:27:16,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah that's right. Trying to actively avoid tropes would probably make a worse story
13-12-2019T02:28:25,SageSaga,actually doing that is a trope
13-12-2019T02:28:34,SageSaga,subversion trope
13-12-2019T02:28:45,w0lfmare,What game? :cw0lfmare-EmberO:

13-12-2019T02:29:19,Ordithus,nothing is original
13-12-2019T02:29:32,SageSaga,too far Ord
13-12-2019T02:29:35,unsteddyphoenix,It's just a wholesome game about cute catgorls

13-12-2019T02:53:43,ZRO4825,"Had an ex years ago decided I was cheating on her because I admitted to having a crush on a girl from my school years. That was a pretty quick ""Yeah, nope, we're done."" :rofl:"
13-12-2019T02:55:28,SageSaga,it's good yall broke up- the age gap was too much considering that woman you had a crush on in school was your Ex's mother

13-12-2019T02:59:04,SageSaga,i really need to just make some 3D models for perspectives
13-12-2019T02:59:13,ZRO4825,Clip has some
13-12-2019T02:59:21,ZRO4825,I got like 3 of'em downloaded already I think o_o

13-12-2019T03:06:51,Dadrobit,"Bleghhhh, I need unqualified moral advice from y'all I think."
13-12-2019T03:07:08,Xalrog,go on Dadbot
13-12-2019T03:07:23,Ordithus,I lack qualifications
13-12-2019T03:08:16,Dadrobit,I really don't like working for free. Like family is the exception that even has exceptions where they pay me.
13-12-2019T03:08:42,ZRO4825,No disagreements there from me.
13-12-2019T03:08:58,Xalrog,"no money, no art"
13-12-2019T03:08:59,Dadrobit,But my sister is begging me right now to do a pro bono commercial for her friend's indie movie
13-12-2019T03:09:18,ZRO4825,That sounds like potentially hours worth of work.
13-12-2019T03:10:00,Dadrobit,"My sister legitimately never asks me for anything, and it sounds like it's a fun project, but still."
13-12-2019T03:10:14,SageSaga,offer to take payment in installments and do it at a discount if it sounds like fun
13-12-2019T03:10:15,Ordithus,If you get credited for marketing and get a cut of any proceeds...
13-12-2019T03:10:19,Dadrobit,"It's be a weekend of work for ""exposure"""
13-12-2019T03:10:19,unsteddyphoenix,how much exposure do they got
13-12-2019T03:10:56,Xalrog,think of all the things you could buy with that exposure !

13-12-2019T03:11:09,Dadrobit,He's touring the movie in something like 6 states.
13-12-2019T03:11:37,Dadrobit,"And yeah, Ord, that's usually the link I send folks who ask for ""exposure"" paid gugs"
13-12-2019T03:11:42,Dadrobit,Gigs*
13-12-2019T03:12:22,Dadrobit,"And sorry, Sage, I do 50/50 up front and completion payments only."
13-12-2019T03:13:25,SageSaga,im saying if its something you think might be fun but still a lot of work- make it easier for them to pay for it
13-12-2019T03:13:46,SageSaga,otherwise- dont do it
13-12-2019T03:13:52,Dadrobit,Installments = two on time payments followed by increasingly delayed  and diminished payments that eventually stop altogether.
13-12-2019T03:14:22,SageSaga,all payments do that
13-12-2019T03:14:46,Xalrog,sounds like my renters :unamused:
13-12-2019T03:15:11,Dadrobit,"Exactly, s'why I don't fuck around about being paid up front and on delivery."

13-12-2019T03:19:14,Kameloh,getting extra lazy
13-12-2019T03:19:30,Ordithus,it is laaaate or should I say early
13-12-2019T03:19:48,SageSaga,late is more appropriate i think

13-12-2019T03:24:25,SageSaga,it's been a long.... long time...

13-12-2019T03:25:31,SageSaga,what good would it be to you if you died for a second monitor?
13-12-2019T03:25:46,Xalrog,used monitors are cheap... unless you are picky
13-12-2019T03:25:57,Xalrog,that is a good point Sage
13-12-2019T03:26:04,SageSaga,even brand new monitors can be cheap
13-12-2019T03:26:26,Dadrobit,"Oh man, got a new monitor over Cyber Monday. Soooo nice"
13-12-2019T03:26:42,ZRO4825,"Depends on how picky you are 'bout your monitor, aye, lol"
13-12-2019T03:27:03,SageSaga,you might be able to pick one up for free via craigs list or Facebook marketplace
13-12-2019T03:27:09,Dadrobit,"27 inch 2K, 144hz is where it's at tbh."
13-12-2019T03:27:18,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I should get a new one.  Been rocking this dell one for like 5 years now
13-12-2019T03:27:47,Dadrobit,Still have my older Dell monitor as well for my secondary rig.
13-12-2019T03:27:49,ZRO4825,I got this monitor iirc around 2009.
13-12-2019T03:28:03,Xalrog,"last one I bought was $5, Dell 2:1 rotatable .... got a free 24"" flatscreen a week ago"
13-12-2019T03:28:24,Dadrobit,"Oh, and I need to contact the shit outta be quiet!"
13-12-2019T03:28:49,SageSaga,i bought a brand new 4k tv for Black Friday- is so pretty
13-12-2019T03:28:51,Dadrobit,The rear exhaust fan has a loud *tickticktick*
13-12-2019T03:28:54,SageSaga,and got it pretty cheap
13-12-2019T03:29:08,Dadrobit,Super defeats the purpose of the entire case
13-12-2019T03:29:17,SageSaga,yeah thats a bad unit
13-12-2019T03:29:27,Ordithus,"""be quiet!"" is what you yell at it! :P"
13-12-2019T03:29:28,SageSaga,probably just gotta replace the fan
13-12-2019T03:29:45,Dadrobit,Hoping they send me a new one.
13-12-2019T03:29:54,RisqueRaptor,Alright I'm going to head to bed.

13-12-2019T03:31:40,Dadrobit,Otherwise it's totally silent lol. Even the medium fan speed has legitimately no noise. High speed gets just the barest of low hums.
13-12-2019T03:32:42,unsteddyphoenix,overclock your fan
13-12-2019T03:32:52,SageSaga,i can set all my fans to max and i cant hear them
13-12-2019T03:33:20,SpazztasticKiwi,so I’ve been watching some odd food videos - would anyone here try shark heart
13-12-2019T03:33:35,SpazztasticKiwi,they were serving it raw
13-12-2019T03:34:09,Ordithus,why do I feel like that would be a high risk for parasites
13-12-2019T03:34:30,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Don't eat sharks, they are hype and important predators needed for the balance of the oceans ecosystems."
13-12-2019T03:34:37,SageSaga,do many parasites infest the heart? That seems dangerous
13-12-2019T03:34:40,Dadrobit,"I think if I didn't have the case situated a foot away from my face I wouldn't hear the fan him. But floor space is a bit of a premium, so onto the desk it goes"
13-12-2019T03:35:02,Dadrobit,Hum*
13-12-2019T03:35:11,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Dad you got a case finally?
13-12-2019T03:35:13,SageSaga,never put computers on the ground
13-12-2019T03:35:29,Dadrobit,"Technically yes, Marv."
13-12-2019T03:35:32,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d say it’d definitely be safer cooked yeah but trying it ehhhh
13-12-2019T03:35:33,SageSaga,thats begging for dust and dirt to be taken in
13-12-2019T03:35:37,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Gang weed wanna halo?
13-12-2019T03:35:57,Dadrobit,Still fighting Amazon over a refund. Ended up just buying from Newegg.
13-12-2019T03:36:41,Dadrobit,"""Oh, we'll just send you a new one instead of a refund"""
13-12-2019T03:37:24,Ordithus,sleeeepy
13-12-2019T03:37:32,SpazztasticKiwi,then wake up
13-12-2019T03:37:36,Ordithus,no
13-12-2019T03:37:37,Dadrobit,"Like, no. You all lost the first one and are so slow to respond to anything, I bought it from a completely different vendor AND got it delivered before you could respond."
13-12-2019T03:38:01,SpazztasticKiwi,then go to sleep
13-12-2019T03:38:12,Ordithus,better idea
13-12-2019T03:38:21,Dadrobit,All else fails I s'pose I can flip it on Craigslist for $100
13-12-2019T03:38:24,Ordithus,Good night!  Thanks for the streams!

13-12-2019T03:38:46,SageSaga,Noodle is wrong
13-12-2019T03:38:47,AspiringNoodle,I will have pizza tomorrow in your honor
13-12-2019T03:39:02,SageSaga,Newegg used to be generally better- but they havent for a while now
13-12-2019T03:39:11,SageSaga,especially since they have to charge tax now too
13-12-2019T03:39:31,Dadrobit,They're both shit tbh. Price gouged the hell outta Black Friday and Cyber Monday.
13-12-2019T03:39:44,AspiringNoodle,"Well, to be fair, if a website isn't charging tax, and your state starts cracking down"
13-12-2019T03:39:49,SageSaga,i dont think either of them are bad at all
13-12-2019T03:39:49,AspiringNoodle,You're f*cked
13-12-2019T03:40:18,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Got a great deal on my surface pro on amazon.  Far cheaper then what best buy was asking for.
13-12-2019T03:40:33,SageSaga,i think they are both Neutral- but Amazon has distro centers all over so i dont have to wait a week for shipping
13-12-2019T03:40:34,Dadrobit,Building on PCPartPicker where it shows the system cost graphic over time showed how everything got jacked up a few months ago and barely dipped for the weekend.
13-12-2019T03:41:15,SageSaga,yeah but where else are you going to get the parts? A store?
13-12-2019T03:41:30,AspiringNoodle,*laughs in Micro Center*
13-12-2019T03:41:35,AspiringNoodle,*cries in lack of Micro Center*
13-12-2019T03:41:42,SageSaga,there arent enough Micro Centers XD
13-12-2019T03:41:48,AspiringNoodle,Don't remind me ;_;
13-12-2019T03:41:54,AspiringNoodle,I would spend SOOOOOOOO much money there...
13-12-2019T03:42:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,There is a mirco center like 40 minutes from me.
13-12-2019T03:42:16,AspiringNoodle,Probably coulda cut the build time on my computer for 3 days to like 2 hours
13-12-2019T03:42:18,Dadrobit,"Yep, that's the kicker. Nothing but a sparse Fry's Electronics an hour away from my house. Nothing else even remotely close."
13-12-2019T03:42:35,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Dad thats the store
13-12-2019T03:42:37,AspiringNoodle,Best Buy has the biggest selection near me
13-12-2019T03:42:47,SageSaga,exactly- so be thankful for online shopping at all! Shut up and buy things and wait for more things to buy!
13-12-2019T03:42:50,AspiringNoodle,"It's actually somewhat decent, given how much space they allocated for it"
13-12-2019T03:43:15,SageSaga,My Best Buy used to have all you needed to build a PC
13-12-2019T03:43:20,SageSaga,now they do not do that...
13-12-2019T03:43:53,SageSaga,"they carry prebuilt systems, storage, and GPUs"
13-12-2019T03:43:54,AspiringNoodle,I'm just hoping Newegg's warehouses aren't as bad as Amazon's
13-12-2019T03:43:58,Xalrog,there are sparse Frys? the one near me is huge
13-12-2019T03:44:10,Dadrobit,"Unless you want to count the Best Buys, but the ones near me have an absolutely tiny selection of components. Unless you're looking for a monitor or keyboards, they have rows and rows of those."
13-12-2019T03:44:31,SageSaga,Neweggs is pretty bad but not enough of them exist to seem as horrible as Amazon's enslavement centers
13-12-2019T03:45:26,Xalrog,the stories I have heard about what goes on in those centers....
13-12-2019T03:45:35,AspiringNoodle,I wish Amazon's warehouse workers luck in their unionization efforts
13-12-2019T03:46:00,SageSaga,they will just get replaced by robots
13-12-2019T03:46:05,Dadrobit,I have only been to that Fry's twice because it's so far away. But both times they were big but empty.
13-12-2019T03:46:22,Dadrobit,#Yang2020
13-12-2019T03:46:24,AspiringNoodle,That's already happening.  But it doesn't excuse the fact that Amazon's warehouses have injury rates 3x the national average
13-12-2019T03:46:30,SageSaga,seriously there shouldnt be anything in an amazon warehouse that cant be automated
13-12-2019T03:46:36,AspiringNoodle,And that includes deaths and injuries severe enough to never let the person return to work
13-12-2019T03:46:48,sunblaze,good morning everyone
13-12-2019T03:46:54,SageSaga,yo Sunblaze
13-12-2019T03:46:55,AspiringNoodle,*looks at clock*

13-12-2019T03:47:27,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Sun
13-12-2019T03:47:57,sunblaze,@AspiringNoodle time marches on! :ptv-snicker:
13-12-2019T03:49:18,Dadrobit,"Got one of my Patrol officers to donate with me last night, felt good."
13-12-2019T03:50:37,maku450,morning sun
13-12-2019T03:50:59,sunblaze,^morning
13-12-2019T03:51:51,Dadrobit,"Felt compelled to throw in some extra and he decided to match me for his first ever donation, extra $200 to the next goal."
13-12-2019T03:53:36,SageSaga,donate for what?
13-12-2019T03:53:53,Dadrobit,Andrew Yang
13-12-2019T03:55:01,SageSaga,"I'd vote for him if he was the nominee, but it seems unlikely"
13-12-2019T03:55:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Even those she won't win I'm sticking with my girl tulsi gabbard
13-12-2019T03:55:33,MarvTheHugPharaoh,though even
13-12-2019T03:55:45,LannAF,yowdy
13-12-2019T03:55:49,MarvTheHugPharaoh,LANNN
13-12-2019T03:55:53,LannAF,MARVVV
13-12-2019T03:56:29,Dadrobit,"I agree that he's a super long shot candidate, I'm willing to donate time/money to keep him in as long as possible to keep getting more and more people to hear his ideas."
13-12-2019T03:57:05,SageSaga,i dont think America is ready for UBI but i think it's going to need to eventually
13-12-2019T03:57:12,LannAF,Saaage
13-12-2019T03:57:16,LannAF,I love this song
13-12-2019T03:57:22,Dadrobit,o/ Lann
13-12-2019T03:57:32,LannAF,o/ Dadrobit
13-12-2019T03:58:12,SageSaga,Lann - do you use Spotify?
13-12-2019T03:58:19,LannAF,I donut.
13-12-2019T03:58:28,LannAF,that costs -money-
13-12-2019T03:58:35,LannAF,"well, premium does."
13-12-2019T03:58:48,Dadrobit,"I think America needs it now, but doesn't know it needs it. The earlier the better."
13-12-2019T03:59:15,LannAF,"Sage, I needa talk to you if you get done streaming relatively soon if you don't mind"
13-12-2019T03:59:21,LannAF,nothing important
13-12-2019T03:59:51,Dadrobit,"The more mindspace it occupies now, the sooner we can get there. Goodness knows barely anyone I know personally even knew UBI was even a concept before Yang hit the stage."
13-12-2019T04:00:02,SageSaga,you can message me on discord and i'll talk when i can
13-12-2019T04:00:51,SageSaga,I have heard about UBI a long time ago but ive heard a lot better versions of it being talked about in the past 5 years
13-12-2019T04:01:11,SageSaga,early versions sounded like Star Trek Pipe dreams
13-12-2019T04:01:23,AspiringNoodle,"Oh yeah, no, they were :P"
13-12-2019T04:01:52,Dadrobit,"Yeah, took a macroeconomics class in college forever ago where it was basically just mentioned as a Star Trek pipe dream."
13-12-2019T04:02:19,AspiringNoodle,"Funny how we're heading closer to a star trek future, though :P"
13-12-2019T04:02:26,Dadrobit,"""It could be a great thing, but it'll never happen"""
13-12-2019T04:02:38,AspiringNoodle,"Maybe not replicator level, but something adjacent and a tier lower"
13-12-2019T04:03:06,AspiringNoodle,"Welp, I'm out.  I hit my wall, lol"
13-12-2019T04:03:15,AspiringNoodle,Nice chatting with everyone :ptv-hearts:
13-12-2019T04:03:16,MarvTheHugPharaoh,see ya noodle
13-12-2019T04:03:16,Dadrobit,o/ noodle
13-12-2019T04:03:52,SageSaga,everything i see says that people if given the choice to work or do nothing- they will chose to do nothing- and then realize it was a mistake and do something XD
13-12-2019T04:04:04,sunblaze,^true
13-12-2019T04:04:37,SageSaga,so i think a UBI will look like the end of the world- and then would turn into a beautiful economy butterfly
13-12-2019T04:05:18,Dadrobit,An economy where no one starts with nothing and always has something to keep them.going.

13-12-2019T05:22:00,RimaDraws,dude i literally felt a bit socially outcast because today when i went to find a spot to sit after we got off the line someone put their gloves in a spot to save for their friend. they knew i was looking for a place to sit

13-12-2019T05:23:38,RimaDraws,i dont get invited to social events with the temporaries because i guess either its me or them. but one guy said its good i dont go to their events because they might just turn around and talk
13-12-2019T05:23:41,LannAF,meh. Imo being close to people who actually share interests with you is way better to focus on.
13-12-2019T05:23:41,RimaDraws,which is terrible
13-12-2019T05:23:50,RimaDraws,yea i like you guys way better

13-12-2019T05:33:50,unsteddyphoenix,Thats why Wakka and Tidus can fight the underwater bosses
13-12-2019T05:33:56,unsteddyphoenix,And Riku for no reason I guess

13-12-2019T05:35:47,SageSaga,the golden tactic of - hiding in your own goal after you get up in the score by 1 because the game is broken
13-12-2019T05:35:50,LannAF,"Pass to lower left, lure out, pass back to your best kicker (tidus, usually) and then spec"
