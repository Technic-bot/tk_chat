07-01-2019T00:00:02,Twokinds,I dunno. I like Monopoly.

07-01-2019T00:02:29,SpazztasticKiwi,^
07-01-2019T00:02:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Right
07-01-2019T00:02:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Get to play often?
07-01-2019T00:04:55,Twokinds,Never
07-01-2019T00:05:11,Twokinds,The last time I got to play was when my brother was in the hospital.
07-01-2019T00:05:14,Twokinds,One of the times...
07-01-2019T00:05:36,Twokinds,I don't remember which one. I think it was like three hospital trips ago.
07-01-2019T00:08:12,SpazztasticKiwi,You mean unrelated to him getting that pain in his side last year
07-01-2019T00:08:19,SpazztasticKiwi,And getting hit by a pickle
07-01-2019T00:08:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Etc...
07-01-2019T00:09:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Why not do a game of monopoly with the D&D group one round as a change?
07-01-2019T00:09:20,Ordithus,You can play it online
07-01-2019T00:09:27,Twokinds,Eh they don't want to play Monopoly.
07-01-2019T00:09:32,SpazztasticKiwi,That‚Äôs my point
07-01-2019T00:09:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Aw
07-01-2019T00:10:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Well poor Tom. Makes me think of the tabletop game area at PAX though
07-01-2019T00:10:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Why didn‚Äôt you guys play while mark was over for Christmas
07-01-2019T00:10:55,Twokinds,I don't own Monopoly
07-01-2019T00:11:12,SpazztasticKiwi,O
07-01-2019T00:11:13,Ordithus,Easy to fix that
07-01-2019T00:12:24,SpazztasticKiwi,That‚Äôs true. But Mark‚Äôs gone home....though who knows if they‚Äôd play if he was
07-01-2019T00:18:32,Ordithus,Ugh this cold sucks

07-01-2019T16:46:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Our new neighbors have apparently decided the big house in the middle of nowhere isn‚Äôt for them

07-01-2019T16:54:41,SpazztasticKiwi,That does make me wonder - can you buy spike strips?

07-01-2019T17:23:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I hope this sore in my jaws just where they put the shots
07-01-2019T17:29:26,ThingsAreMoving,"wut, did you have a tooth removed or something?"
07-01-2019T17:43:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Just a filling
07-01-2019T17:43:47,SpazztasticKiwi,A ‚Äútiny one‚Äù he called it
07-01-2019T17:44:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Also gotta go get a filling fixed. That‚Äôs the one I‚Äôm iffy on
07-01-2019T17:44:37,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs behind my front teeth
07-01-2019T17:45:14,ThingsAreMoving,"ouch, those are sensitive"
07-01-2019T17:46:08,ThingsAreMoving,hopefully your jaw gets better after some time
07-01-2019T17:46:56,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs likely just from the two shots they gave me to numb it
07-01-2019T17:47:02,ThingsAreMoving,"I remember when I had my wisdom tooth extracted, the procedure itself took 6 minutes including the shots"
07-01-2019T17:47:23,ThingsAreMoving,the numbness subsided after.... seven hours?
07-01-2019T17:47:28,ThingsAreMoving,maybe a bit less
07-01-2019T17:47:49,SpazztasticKiwi,But the fixing the filling things gonna get me. It‚Äôs the front teeth. Very visible
07-01-2019T17:49:37,ThingsAreMoving,"wait, do they give you numbing shots for filllings?"
07-01-2019T17:49:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Yea
07-01-2019T17:49:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Why
07-01-2019T17:50:15,ThingsAreMoving,I didn't have any when I had my fillings made
07-01-2019T17:50:32,SpazztasticKiwi,You poor brave thing
07-01-2019T17:50:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Jesus
07-01-2019T17:51:37,ThingsAreMoving,"Hrm, the drilling wasn't too bad. the worst thing was when the doctor flushed the bits with water and then used compressed air to dry the area"
07-01-2019T17:52:42,ThingsAreMoving,"Oh well, maybe next time I'm gonna ask for some numbing shots just to see what it's like having a tooth fixed without pain."
07-01-2019T17:54:37,Xexanoth,it usually depends on the size and location of the fillings
07-01-2019T17:55:11,Xexanoth,if you just need a very small filling it's often done without shots
07-01-2019T17:55:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Well he did say they‚Äôre ‚Äútiny‚Äù
07-01-2019T17:55:58,SpazztasticKiwi,And they‚Äôre in the very back
07-01-2019T17:56:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"The first shot, I only felt some pressure but I got antsy at one point so they decided to give another one just for good measure"
07-01-2019T17:57:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Couldn‚Äôt feel anything from my mid front all the way to the back
07-01-2019T17:58:04,Xexanoth,"that's why i told my dentist to try without shots first, had a numb mouth once when i got my wisdom teeth removed, really not an experience i wanna repeat...."
07-01-2019T17:58:30,Bgrmystr2,"..you'd rather the extreme pain of feeling everything, xex?"
07-01-2019T17:58:33,Bgrmystr2,bruh
07-01-2019T17:59:19,ThingsAreMoving,Don't get a tooth extracted without numbing
07-01-2019T17:59:28,Xexanoth,rather a short bit of pain than a day with a numb mouth
07-01-2019T17:59:37,Xexanoth,well it was just a filling not a tooth extraction so....
07-01-2019T17:59:59,ThingsAreMoving,well for fillings I wouldn't bother too
07-01-2019T18:00:21,Bgrmystr2,"lol Xex.. I did that when I was younger, and that was a bad move."
07-01-2019T18:00:26,Bgrmystr2,:v
07-01-2019T18:00:38,Bgrmystr2,"but yeah seriously, never go without the numbing"
07-01-2019T18:00:42,Bgrmystr2,never ever
07-01-2019T18:00:49,Bgrmystr2,"because there is no ""short bit"""
07-01-2019T18:00:54,Xexanoth,"i mean, i just did it recently for my first filling so....."
07-01-2019T18:01:18,Bgrmystr2,yeah they don't cut your teeth into 11 shards to take it out without numbing it at all
07-01-2019T18:01:21,Bgrmystr2,>.>
07-01-2019T18:01:36,ThingsAreMoving,oof
07-01-2019T18:02:14,ThingsAreMoving,let me guess... anchor shaped roots?
07-01-2019T18:02:21,Bgrmystr2,"I don't know, it was a long time ago"
07-01-2019T18:02:34,Bgrmystr2,but apparently it's a popular opinion among my teeth
07-01-2019T18:02:41,Bgrmystr2,though not for all of em
07-01-2019T18:02:45,Bgrmystr2,a few though..
07-01-2019T18:03:32,Bgrmystr2,I had four pulled within the past year or so
07-01-2019T18:04:28,Bgrmystr2,"fillings are not bad, but pulling teeth without numb is just no."
07-01-2019T18:05:41,Bgrmystr2,you get to go the whole day eating ice cream and other soft things that are great.. talk with a slur and make fun of people with it..
07-01-2019T18:05:52,Bgrmystr2,"and you give it all away for pain, xex? xD"
07-01-2019T18:06:24,Xexanoth,i try to not mess up my teeth in the first place....
07-01-2019T18:06:35,Bgrmystr2,for me it didn't matter.
07-01-2019T18:06:40,Xexanoth,worked mostly except that one stupid tooth in the back....
07-01-2019T18:06:49,Bgrmystr2,Brush and brush and brush and they still fucked off.
07-01-2019T18:07:05,Xexanoth,luckily good teeth run in my family
07-01-2019T18:07:29,Xexanoth,all my grandparents had most of their teeth even in old age
07-01-2019T18:07:45,Bgrmystr2,consider yourself lucky I guess
07-01-2019T18:09:02,SpazztasticKiwi,My problem is cavity susceptible in between teetg
07-01-2019T18:09:45,Bgrmystr2,The dentist had to cut my gums into a bloody mess just to get my teeth out nearly every time I went so.. and that's presuming the tooth doesn't hold itself in place and need to be cut into pieces to be taken out.. yeah dentist trips for me are not fun.
07-01-2019T18:10:05,Bgrmystr2,I can't imagine going without numbing my face into oblivion
07-01-2019T18:10:15,Bgrmystr2,cuz I feel that pain for weeks.
07-01-2019T18:10:49,Bgrmystr2,"even with the numb, it's still sore a month later."
07-01-2019T18:12:14,Bgrmystr2,"but I guess a month of pain is.. technically.. a short bit of pain in the grand scheme of life, haha"
07-01-2019T18:12:17,Xexanoth,:ptv-shock:
07-01-2019T18:12:41,THETOXICATOR,Hi
07-01-2019T18:13:06,Bgrmystr2,"I think I'll pass on it though, xex."
07-01-2019T18:13:12,Bgrmystr2,Probably
07-01-2019T18:13:16,Bgrmystr2,Hey toxicator
07-01-2019T18:13:40,THETOXICATOR,How are you doing today
07-01-2019T18:14:11,Bgrmystr2,eh~
07-01-2019T18:14:15,Bgrmystr2,brb gonna get somethin to eat
07-01-2019T18:14:44,ThingsAreMoving,something chrunchy
07-01-2019T18:15:01,ThingsAreMoving,gotta enjoy the time without pain
07-01-2019T18:19:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm clearing my bathroom. Anyone want a goat leather coat
07-01-2019T18:19:55,ThingsAreMoving,How are the two things related? :ctwokinds-keithdotdotdot:
07-01-2019T18:20:40,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs been hanging in the bathroom. I don‚Äôt wear it
07-01-2019T18:25:46,ThingsAreMoving,sell it on ebay or keep it just in case we enter an ice age
07-01-2019T18:26:05,Bgrmystr2,all things are related as they all move.
07-01-2019T18:26:44,ThingsAreMoving,"truth, but some relations are more complicated than just moving"
07-01-2019T18:26:56,ThingsAreMoving,and I'm a curious beast
07-01-2019T18:26:58,Bgrmystr2,"perhaps, but everything moves."
07-01-2019T18:27:01,Bgrmystr2,"and thus, it's related."
07-01-2019T18:27:19,Bgrmystr2,"even you, you are related."
07-01-2019T18:27:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Ok how‚Äôs this explanation:
07-01-2019T18:27:34,SpazztasticKiwi,My ex got it for me and it‚Äôs near two sizes too big
07-01-2019T18:27:38,Bgrmystr2,"though I guess, things, you *are* the relation"
07-01-2019T18:28:01,Bgrmystr2,oo but those are the best kind kiwi
07-01-2019T18:28:04,ThingsAreMoving,The real thing bugging me with that thing is why the heck it was kept in a bathroom
07-01-2019T18:28:21,Bgrmystr2,is it fuzzy on the inside?
07-01-2019T18:28:38,ThingsAreMoving,so it's a coat / bathrobe?
07-01-2019T18:28:58,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs big enough on me to act like a bathrobe
07-01-2019T18:29:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Damn near goes to my knees
07-01-2019T18:29:14,Bgrmystr2,best
07-01-2019T18:29:19,THETOXICATOR,Im feeling weird
07-01-2019T18:29:20,ThingsAreMoving,nice
07-01-2019T18:29:30,Bgrmystr2,"trenchcoats are awesome, even the ones that are not intentional"
07-01-2019T18:29:33,SpazztasticKiwi,But it‚Äôs a regular lambskin leather coat
07-01-2019T18:29:51,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve never looked it up to see how much it fetches
07-01-2019T18:30:02,ThingsAreMoving,You could always donate it somewhere
07-01-2019T18:30:22,ThingsAreMoving,real leather should fetch a nice price
07-01-2019T18:30:42,THETOXICATOR,I should sleep but I cant
07-01-2019T18:31:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Answer: it fetches anywhere from $60-$500
07-01-2019T18:31:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Sweet jesus
07-01-2019T18:31:44,ThingsAreMoving,yup
07-01-2019T18:31:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Jesus
07-01-2019T18:31:56,THETOXICATOR,Gawd
07-01-2019T18:32:23,SpazztasticKiwi,The lowest I see it for is $21
07-01-2019T18:33:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Who‚Äôs buying this thing for $500!?!!
07-01-2019T18:33:16,THETOXICATOR,Memeeme
07-01-2019T18:33:36,ThingsAreMoving,high-middle class people
07-01-2019T18:34:04,SpazztasticKiwi,"No I mean in general. If it sells for lowers in other places (amazon, eBay, Walmart online), why but it for $500"
07-01-2019T18:34:08,SpazztasticKiwi,buy
07-01-2019T18:34:22,THETOXICATOR,To flex
07-01-2019T18:34:22,ThingsAreMoving,Cause leather coats are an investment
07-01-2019T18:34:39,ThingsAreMoving,with a bit or proper maintenance they can serve you for decades
07-01-2019T18:35:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôd say so. So this trying to tell me this ex bought me a (to be approximate) $50ish coat
07-01-2019T18:35:25,ThingsAreMoving,"I had my leather jacket for 15 years now, high chance I'll be using it still after another 15"
07-01-2019T18:35:29,THETOXICATOR,I wish I could by human leather
07-01-2019T18:35:44,ThingsAreMoving,"Toxic, please don't be weird"
07-01-2019T18:35:51,THETOXICATOR,Ok
07-01-2019T18:35:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Y buy it? It‚Äôs cheaper to harvest and make your own
07-01-2019T18:35:59,ThingsAreMoving,Thank you
07-01-2019T18:36:07,THETOXICATOR,But crocodile skin
07-01-2019T18:36:23,Bgrmystr2,everyone already wears human leather though.
07-01-2019T18:36:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Another reason I don‚Äôt wear it - I don‚Äôt like leather too much
07-01-2019T18:36:29,Bgrmystr2,it's called skin :ptv-unimpressed:
07-01-2019T18:36:31,ThingsAreMoving,Ayyy bgr
07-01-2019T18:36:31,THETOXICATOR,Yes

07-01-2019T18:36:45,SpazztasticKiwi,It also came with gloves. Those fit at least
07-01-2019T18:36:56,THETOXICATOR,I got to feel my own leather
07-01-2019T18:37:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Why‚Äôs that sound like a euphemism
07-01-2019T18:37:51,Bgrmystr2,cuz it could be used as one
07-01-2019T18:37:53,ThingsAreMoving,"Dirty mind, kiwi. tsk tsk tsk"
07-01-2019T18:37:55,Bgrmystr2,and might have been.
07-01-2019T18:37:55,THETOXICATOR,I accidentally cut up a big wound on my thumb dow into the flesh
07-01-2019T18:38:08,SpazztasticKiwi,No it‚Äôs a sexy imagination. Get it right

07-01-2019T23:27:48,unsteddyphoenix,Nah kids are cheap labour
07-01-2019T23:28:36,SpazztasticKiwi,And if they mess up the lawn - like a statue or hedge?
07-01-2019T23:29:34,unsteddyphoenix,You can use to money you saved to buy a new statue!
07-01-2019T23:29:52,unsteddyphoenix,Like a living lizard golem
07-01-2019T23:30:00,unsteddyphoenix,Thats probably what trace did
07-01-2019T23:33:17,Twokinds,I wonder what the neighbors would say if I got a lizard statue for my yard.

07-01-2019T23:33:48,Twokinds,Yeah.
07-01-2019T23:34:01,unsteddyphoenix,What an icebreaker though
07-01-2019T23:34:08,SpazztasticKiwi,And they can‚Äôt say anything worse that what they thought when Mark filmed his King of the Squirrels run through the yard
