31-10-2019T00:45:23,AspiringNoodle,"I swear, the more they try to sound like they have an answer for everything, the more they sound like a gigantic ass :ptv-unimpressed:"
31-10-2019T00:48:05,Dadrobit,"It works though unfortunately. They're not really targeting people like me who have an understanding of the way computers and electronic scams work. They're targeting the elderly and the very uninformed who have to do things like ""Google Bitcoin""."
31-10-2019T00:49:40,Dadrobit,"All they have to do is send that out to 10000 people, and if even a half of a single percent fall for it, boom, they scored almost 50k."
31-10-2019T00:54:50,JojoF2415,Ok I understand
31-10-2019T00:55:57,JojoF2415,I can’t believe I spent all of Halloween watching hocus pocus. I’m going to sleep. I have a presentation tomorrow
31-10-2019T01:07:30,AspiringNoodle,I didn't even read that entire thing because first red flag was it came through an email
31-10-2019T01:09:19,AspiringNoodle,"Like, b*tch plz, if you had control of the entire system, you could lock me out and do whatever you wanted.  Maybe a pop-up saying ""To unlock, please transfer $X worth of bitcoin to this wallet"""
31-10-2019T01:09:48,AspiringNoodle,"If you had full control of my account, don't tell me... I'll just get back in, change things up, clean my system.  Make it so you don't have access anymore"
31-10-2019T01:10:35,AspiringNoodle,"If you were watching me for a few months... again, don't tell me.  You would have all sorts of good info just from ""watching"""
31-10-2019T01:11:14,AspiringNoodle,...I think I'll stop there.  I could write an entire damned essay on everything wrong with this email...

31-10-2019T21:15:00,Mihari,Yah looks nice.
31-10-2019T21:15:15,ZRO4825,OW2 announced. I haz an excite. Also D4! <3
31-10-2019T21:15:31,ElvenHunter84,"Wow, how old is this sketch, Tom? I don't even remember this one"

31-10-2019T21:15:45,ZRO4825,XD
31-10-2019T21:15:47,Mihari,"As for blizzcon well OW2 looks nice, still not sure on it, if you're talking about the Hearthstone crap, yaaaah, it's a mess."

31-10-2019T21:16:54,HoverdudeXL,Nicd
31-10-2019T21:16:57,IronHorseComics,when they ban a player for anti-China they have a team of assassins take him and the person is never seen again
31-10-2019T21:16:57,Mihari,People making a fuss tend to try to be seen and when it's a live show with multiple camera angles... XD
31-10-2019T21:16:59,Mihari,Well...
31-10-2019T21:18:23,Stormagedon,Imma play some battlefront 2 while i watch... if it loads
31-10-2019T21:18:31,HoverdudeXL,Ok
31-10-2019T21:18:50,IronHorseComics,it wants you to pay a loading fee
31-10-2019T21:18:58,IronHorseComics,because it's EA
31-10-2019T21:18:58,AcePilotIV,lmao i had a bfv but my account is fucked

31-10-2019T21:22:25,Mihari,If I had to guess it will be much like uplay games.
31-10-2019T21:22:36,Mihari,"You launch from Steam, which will then launch uplay, which will launch your game."
31-10-2019T21:22:42,SageSaga,no

31-10-2019T21:22:51,IronHorseComics,too many middle men
31-10-2019T21:22:58,SageSaga,that's not what they said
31-10-2019T21:23:05,Mihari,Oh? That's confirmed?
31-10-2019T21:23:22,SomeNiceUser,Steam is my favorite launcher so far.
31-10-2019T21:23:31,BadFoMo,"@Mihari Well, if that's the case, I'm out."
31-10-2019T21:23:35,SageSaga,they said origin would not be required on the official reddit thing
31-10-2019T21:23:55,IronHorseComics,"it does need some competition though, and I don't mean the Epic Games Store"
31-10-2019T21:23:56,BadFoMo,I'm maybe back in.
31-10-2019T21:23:58,Mihari,"Interesting, I don't mind either way."
31-10-2019T21:24:35,HoverdudeXL,Oh
31-10-2019T21:24:42,Mihari,I don't get too hung up on Launchers.
31-10-2019T21:24:54,Mihari,Heck I remembered when games had their own launcher for just that title XD
31-10-2019T21:24:54,BadFoMo,"As long as I can just pay once and have the gane for life, I'm cool."
31-10-2019T21:24:58,Mihari,I'm looking at you Sims!

31-10-2019T21:30:38,SageSaga,though technically speaking- if you are under 13 you shouldnt be here
31-10-2019T21:30:55,SageSaga,since you have to be over 13 to get an account technically
31-10-2019T21:31:16,SageSaga,(in a world where kids dont lie about their age when asked by a website)
31-10-2019T21:31:43,Sclimshady,"I'm actually 12, I just lie a lot"

31-10-2019T21:55:53,SageSaga,nah he still sleeps to reorganize his brain
31-10-2019T21:56:02,Stormagedon,I think they had a comic off that. It wasent sleep that made him snap... But it still was really bad
31-10-2019T21:56:05,SageSaga,"thats like saying ""You dont need to ever sleep -you can just eat food for energy"""
31-10-2019T21:56:07,HoverdudeXL,Lol

31-10-2019T21:57:17,IronHorseComics,and lord help you if you manage to piss him off
31-10-2019T21:57:19,SageSaga,for the 20th time

31-10-2019T21:57:32,HoverdudeXL,Oh
31-10-2019T21:58:03,IronHorseComics,unless you're Lex Luthor running for president and making Superman angry is part of your evil plan
31-10-2019T21:58:20,ZRO4825,That never seems to work out well for Lex. :joy:
31-10-2019T21:58:23,SageSaga,nah he shuts off most of his senses when he sleeps- which is why he made that high pitched alarm system for his friends like Jimmy

31-10-2019T22:00:07,SageSaga,Superman has been mind controlled a lot even though hes highly resistant to it-
31-10-2019T22:00:17,SageSaga,and he was even turned into a cheetah monster
31-10-2019T22:00:29,HoverdudeXL,Oh
