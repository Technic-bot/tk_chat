18-03-2019T10:40:37,iliar,What happened?
18-03-2019T10:41:07,Twokinds,Nothing. Just didn't get a lot of sleep.

18-03-2019T11:08:30,Azumachan,Hey.
18-03-2019T11:08:57,Azumachan,"Patreon is going to mess up again it seem, with their new tier system."
18-03-2019T11:16:51,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
18-03-2019T11:17:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Sleep. Still tired
18-03-2019T11:17:18,SpazztasticKiwi,But I just scrubbed my hair
18-03-2019T11:23:19,SpazztasticKiwi,And I found a very pretty solar system laser engrave thing
18-03-2019T11:25:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d say early birthday present for me but I’m not too much of a space nut
18-03-2019T11:39:25,Twokinds,Did patreon change something again?
18-03-2019T11:45:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe. Still looks as normal
18-03-2019T11:46:39,Azumachan,Can i post a link related to the matter ?
18-03-2019T11:46:48,Twokinds,I guess?

18-03-2019T11:51:21,Twokinds,I see. So they're upping their price fee. Wonderful...
18-03-2019T11:53:51,Twokinds,Prices will stay the same for me for now. Wonder how long though.
18-03-2019T11:53:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Looks like buckets of fun
18-03-2019T11:57:06,Twokinds,I'm not sure why Patreon needs more than 5%.
18-03-2019T11:59:50,Twokinds,"I can understand offering premium services, but taking out stuff they already offer like membership tiers and making those require 8% from now on... seems like they just want a bigger cut."

18-03-2019T12:02:00,iliar,"Tom, just in case. A site with a gallery can be useful for searching for art that you forgot to publish on dA"

18-03-2019T12:03:14,iliar,"Just use tag sorting by tag ""Color Art"" http://twokinds.gallery/gallery.jsp?WithTags=Color+Art"
18-03-2019T12:04:37,iliar,"And if you want, I can create a separate page with colored art that was not published on dA"
18-03-2019T12:05:04,Twokinds,Uh... that's okay
18-03-2019T12:05:28,Twokinds,All the art not up yet is already scheduled to post every hour for the next two days
18-03-2019T12:06:00,Twokinds,"So, it's taken care of! But thanks."
18-03-2019T12:31:02,Azumachan,I'm sorry for the bad news.
18-03-2019T12:41:52,mingun,"@Twokinds Thanks for the clarification. Of course, I understand that patron's count about 340 with $10-or-above rewards, even if only 50% of them have sketch requests, it is physically impossible to fit them into about 80 poll variants,"
18-03-2019T12:42:22,mingun,"just it was a bit unclear for me rejection reason: either I was wrong somewhere, or it should be."
18-03-2019T12:42:31,mingun,"Maybe just worth adding a small explanation to the Google form like “if your sketch request was completed the last time, maybe this time it will not be in poll due to patron's count, who wants to send a request”."
18-03-2019T12:42:38,mingun,"PS. Sorry for late answer, but when I asking it was 02:00 in my local time, so it was too late for me to answer. I waited for when we both we're online."
18-03-2019T12:56:39,TorqueEmUp,"So since there is 5 Sundays this month, are you still only doing 3 sketch streams, or you going to fit in an extra? Or still do the standard 3 sketch and then color, then take a week off?"

18-03-2019T13:12:38,SpazztasticKiwi,so to speak. I imagine that’s not fur
18-03-2019T13:13:17,Twokinds,dressing for the occasion

18-03-2019T13:26:17,Bgrmystr2,he's been backed up for months in the past multiple times xD
18-03-2019T13:26:18,Bgrmystr2,nothin changes

18-03-2019T13:44:20,Dadrobit,"Zooming in to the full sized version is fine, but the artifacting inflicted on the standard view is seriously bad."
18-03-2019T13:46:08,Dadrobit,"Maybe it's always been that way, I dunno. Barely ever use DA tbh. But I feel like it was never THIS bad?"
18-03-2019T13:57:04,Xexanoth,"nah, i agree it's gotten worse"
18-03-2019T13:57:07,Twokinds,"Yeah, dA's compression took a nosedive all of the sudden"
18-03-2019T13:57:30,Twokinds,I noticed it too

18-03-2019T14:33:52,SpazztasticKiwi,So did they send a chip or and entire brain for you
18-03-2019T14:35:50,RimaDraws,hi kiwi
18-03-2019T14:36:33,SpazztasticKiwi,ay
18-03-2019T14:38:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Why’s nurse natani mature gated
18-03-2019T14:39:50,SpazztasticKiwi,It shows clevage. Suggestive but not sexual. Did no one tell the deviantart gaters boobs exist
18-03-2019T14:41:12,RimaDraws,i love that raine-y morning walk
18-03-2019T14:42:24,RimaDraws,also cause suggestive themes?
18-03-2019T14:43:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Somebody call Victoria cause her secret is out
18-03-2019T14:44:03,RimaDraws,smh
18-03-2019T14:44:16,SpazztasticKiwi,And apparently it’s a-scary

18-03-2019T15:06:45,SpazztasticKiwi,It was for me
18-03-2019T15:06:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Had to flip the switch back
18-03-2019T15:07:11,SpazztasticKiwi,“Im 22 I swear”
18-03-2019T15:08:03,SpazztasticKiwi,I just had an idea
18-03-2019T15:08:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Completely unrelated but do you know what the markings for Kirara look like
18-03-2019T15:08:34,SpazztasticKiwi,From Inuyasha
18-03-2019T15:10:16,RimaDraws,no not really
18-03-2019T15:12:20,SpazztasticKiwi,https://inuyasha.fandom.com/wiki/File:Kirara38.jpg
18-03-2019T15:12:33,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s her regular form. She gets bigger
18-03-2019T15:13:00,RimaDraws,i know ive seen the show
18-03-2019T15:13:03,SpazztasticKiwi,But she’s about Nibblys size. I could see Nib with that pattern - without changing the colors even
18-03-2019T15:14:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Not gonna try tho. Probably not enough people that know who Kirara is
18-03-2019T15:14:31,RimaDraws,not everyone watches anime
18-03-2019T15:15:20,Twokinds,I remember Inuyasha
18-03-2019T15:15:36,RimaDraws,it was something i watched in school
18-03-2019T15:15:57,RimaDraws,sailor moon came before inuyasha tho. i love that show
18-03-2019T15:17:56,RimaDraws,tom do you remember outlaw star?
18-03-2019T15:19:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"As you likely know since I’ve not shut up about it, I’ve been rewatching Inuyasha"
18-03-2019T15:19:20,RimaDraws,i rewatched seasons one and two on netflix
18-03-2019T15:19:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Winding down with the final act rn
18-03-2019T15:19:53,RimaDraws,i dont have all the episodes. i wanna buy them to collect.
18-03-2019T15:20:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Me. Too
18-03-2019T15:20:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m debating ordering it all sometime soon
18-03-2019T15:20:31,RimaDraws,idk when i will be able to
18-03-2019T15:20:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Even the movies even though they’re not considered cannon for the show
18-03-2019T15:20:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Which is a shame

18-03-2019T15:21:33,RimaDraws,hi CT
18-03-2019T15:21:34,SpazztasticKiwi,But the first and final seasons are available for free online to watch
18-03-2019T15:21:38,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s what I’m doing
18-03-2019T15:21:48,RimaDraws,thats just....hmmm
18-03-2019T15:22:13,RimaDraws,i also need to upgrade my clip studio paint to ex
18-03-2019T15:22:17,SpazztasticKiwi,It says the site is sourcing them from hulu
18-03-2019T15:22:27,SpazztasticKiwi,So surely it’s not illegal
18-03-2019T15:22:39,RimaDraws,not really no
18-03-2019T15:22:49,RimaDraws,if you stream them for free without ads no
18-03-2019T15:23:06,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s a single pop up ad at the beginning but nothing more
18-03-2019T15:23:28,SpazztasticKiwi,My phone blocks alot of ads. “Ask me” option
18-03-2019T15:24:03,RimaDraws,yea
18-03-2019T15:25:52,SpazztasticKiwi,How much of it you remember Tom
18-03-2019T15:32:29,Twokinds,Next to nothing
18-03-2019T15:33:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Shame
18-03-2019T15:34:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe try again sometime now it’s finished
18-03-2019T15:34:22,SpazztasticKiwi,And if you ever get time
18-03-2019T15:34:56,SpazztasticKiwi,You hopefully remember who was good and who was bad at least right
18-03-2019T15:35:19,RimaDraws,same
18-03-2019T15:38:47,Mippy,Inuyasha....that was while ago
18-03-2019T15:41:46,Mippy,Had to put a splash of Cold War in my tea because it was too hot

18-03-2019T15:48:23,RimaDraws,i may have found a platform to post my comic to other than patreon
18-03-2019T15:49:56,Mippy,Disconnected Click here to confirm: Kind of like the first one better. The material of the second one looks cheap. Or maybe I’m just biased because you showed me the black colour way in the first one.
18-03-2019T15:50:42,Bgrmystr2,"nice fail at the top, mippy lol"
18-03-2019T15:51:23,RimaDraws,lol
18-03-2019T15:51:52,Mippy,Thank you
18-03-2019T15:54:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Both come in a few colors including black
18-03-2019T15:54:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I like the purple on the first
18-03-2019T15:54:59,SpazztasticKiwi,actually the purple on the second
18-03-2019T15:55:05,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s brighter
18-03-2019T15:55:17,SpazztasticKiwi,But the black gives more to work with

18-03-2019T16:28:24,Twokinds,I bought some flowers and gifts for my mom for her birthday tomorrow... but now I'm second guessing whether her birthday really is tomorrow or not.
18-03-2019T16:28:50,Twokinds,I'm not sure. I think it is.
18-03-2019T16:31:37,Xexanoth,"welp, time to find out in a subtle manner"
18-03-2019T16:31:59,Xexanoth,not sure how though...
18-03-2019T16:32:28,Twokinds,XD
18-03-2019T16:32:44,Xexanoth,ask her if she has anything planned?
18-03-2019T16:34:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Legit my only idea is shoot Mark a quick text
18-03-2019T16:35:11,SpazztasticKiwi,"Cause I was thinking it was this month but I’m not exactly, well, stalking I guess you’d say"
18-03-2019T16:35:29,SpazztasticKiwi,I got a friends birthday this month is all I know
18-03-2019T16:35:55,Mippy,No harm in getting mom a gift when it’s not her birthday
18-03-2019T16:36:14,Xexanoth,"the only reason i know my moms birthday is because i know 4 other people that have the same birthday, makes it kinda hard to miss"

18-03-2019T16:40:27,SpazztasticKiwi,That day is well known

18-03-2019T17:02:02,SpazztasticKiwi,The swelling looks to have pretty much all deflated though which is v good
18-03-2019T17:06:16,SpazztasticKiwi,But in more important news I got lasagna
18-03-2019T17:40:31,RimaDraws,back
18-03-2019T17:41:08,RimaDraws,also just ask if she just has anything special tomorrow
18-03-2019T17:41:58,RimaDraws,having your wisdom teeth taken out isnt bad. you just need to not dry socket where your teeth were taken out or they can get infected
18-03-2019T17:45:40,SpazztasticKiwi,He’s been told he shouldn’t be talking(recording/streaming) basically at all
18-03-2019T17:45:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Guess what he’s doing
18-03-2019T17:46:22,RimaDraws,hes doing all that
18-03-2019T17:46:22,SpazztasticKiwi,But the swelling is down. Just soreness it seems so he’s good I guess
18-03-2019T17:46:39,RimaDraws,but its still going to hurt him if he does anything of the sort
18-03-2019T17:47:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Though he’s gonna be him anyway so there’s not much that can be done. I’m sure he’ll be fine
18-03-2019T17:48:06,RimaDraws,yea he will be
18-03-2019T17:50:12,Dadrobit,I'm like 98% sure my little brother has that exact velvet gown you posted earlier.
18-03-2019T17:51:12,Dadrobit,He likes to go to the Renaissance Festival as The Bearded Lady.
18-03-2019T17:51:49,Dadrobit,"Also, just got back from Captain Marvel. Meh/10"
18-03-2019T17:54:18,RimaDraws,ive heard meh from you and a it was awesome from another friend
18-03-2019T17:59:39,Dadrobit,I don't want to spoil it but you know what a Mary Sue is?
18-03-2019T18:00:05,SpazztasticKiwi,It was good how dare
18-03-2019T18:00:20,NibblyBot,New Deviantart Post: Dance With Me! https://www.deviantart.com/twokinds/art/Dance-With-Me-790158199
18-03-2019T18:04:10,SpazztasticKiwi,So I just looked up Sesshomaus voice actor for fun
18-03-2019T18:04:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Same dude that does J. A. R. V. I. S.
18-03-2019T18:05:46,SpazztasticKiwi,in Avengers Assemble at least
18-03-2019T18:07:02,RimaDraws,oooh?
18-03-2019T18:07:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I know the actor for Inuyasha was the same gues who did Quicksilver in the animated version
18-03-2019T18:07:40,SpazztasticKiwi,guy
18-03-2019T18:09:49,SpazztasticKiwi,And he was apparently in Ghost Rider too
18-03-2019T18:10:17,Dadrobit,"It was flashy, but that was about it. Captain Marvel herself was utterly uninteresting."
18-03-2019T18:11:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Wet blanket
18-03-2019T18:14:05,Dadrobit,"Brie Larson is so lackluster in charm and charisma that the only way she lights up a room is by leaving it. The humor was forced, and the only interactions that felt halfway interesting were those where she was talking to Samuel Jackson, but that's more"
18-03-2019T18:14:45,Dadrobit,a credit to his ability to act even when he's paired with the equivalent of a semi-sentient block of wood
18-03-2019T18:18:43,Twokinds,Working on next page now!
18-03-2019T18:18:49,Twokinds,Sorry to keep everyone waiting...

18-03-2019T18:18:54,Twokinds,I've been doing a lot of writing.
18-03-2019T18:19:04,Twokinds,"Hopefully, writer's block will not be a problem for a while now."
18-03-2019T18:19:07,RimaDraws,yayyy take your time
18-03-2019T18:19:13,Dadrobit,\o/
18-03-2019T18:19:23,Bgrmystr2,"got it all sorted, tom?"
18-03-2019T18:20:10,RimaDraws,happy writing
18-03-2019T18:24:53,Twokinds,Yeah it took a lot of effort to get it all sorted out.
18-03-2019T18:25:02,Twokinds,I think I have a good idea now how to get it going.
18-03-2019T18:25:07,Bgrmystr2,niice
18-03-2019T18:25:09,Twokinds,I'll try to make up for lost time.

18-03-2019T18:25:27,Bgrmystr2,well done all the same. :thumbsup:
18-03-2019T18:25:48,Bgrmystr2,Bet it feels good to be back on top of things story-wise
18-03-2019T18:26:27,RimaDraws,well don't rush. i am glad you got out of the block. i get art block sometimes.
18-03-2019T18:26:46,Twokinds,It happens.
18-03-2019T18:26:49,Twokinds,to us all.
18-03-2019T18:26:54,RimaDraws,it does but it sucks.
18-03-2019T18:27:14,Twokinds,"Unfortunately, sometimes it only gets solved with time, which is hard when you're on a weekly schedule."
18-03-2019T18:28:08,Bgrmystr2,yeh
18-03-2019T18:28:20,RimaDraws,it happens when i get burned out.
18-03-2019T18:28:27,RimaDraws,so i have to take a break to recouperate.
18-03-2019T18:28:34,Bgrmystr2,"I assume you have some twists and surprises for us in the story, but I bet talking abotu that would be spoilers lol"
18-03-2019T18:29:07,RimaDraws,i'm excited for more :3
18-03-2019T18:29:11,Bgrmystr2,same

18-03-2019T18:31:05,Bgrmystr2,it's good when it's just embedded into the background. Good compromise between not having something vs having one obnoxious and in your face
18-03-2019T18:31:17,RimaDraws,yea and everyone can see the art just fine.
18-03-2019T18:31:19,Twokinds,For sure

18-03-2019T19:32:17,SpazztasticKiwi,You know how I said that streaming service had just season one and the final act?
18-03-2019T19:32:25,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s a drop down menu
18-03-2019T19:32:35,Bgrmystr2,lool gg

18-03-2019T19:33:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Because that’s all that’ll fit when there’s over 150 episodes total
18-03-2019T19:33:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Excuse me while I go to a cliff and jump to a conclusion

18-03-2019T22:23:13,CrRAR,very charming
18-03-2019T22:24:30,RimaDraws,thank you
18-03-2019T22:25:22,RimaDraws,of course it would be cleaned up more than that sketch but i was wondering if that's how it should look.
