23-05-2019T00:00:45,Ordithus,I might have to get sushi for lunch tomorrow
23-05-2019T00:10:35,SpazztasticKiwi,you actually have a sushi place
23-05-2019T00:11:34,Ordithus,"Yeah!  A few, actually.  Osaka, Cloud 9, Hanabi."
23-05-2019T00:12:34,Ordithus,"Some of the grocery stores have ""sushi"" too but I don't know about that"
23-05-2019T00:13:01,SpazztasticKiwi,ok
23-05-2019T00:13:06,SpazztasticKiwi,brag about it
23-05-2019T00:13:22,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-lynnsmile: it's goood
23-05-2019T00:13:56,Ordithus,I take it you do not
23-05-2019T00:14:16,SpazztasticKiwi,we have Mexican and a Mandrian place. Last I was there it was run by a Mandrian couple
23-05-2019T00:14:38,SpazztasticKiwi,that was years ago - as in when my dad was still alive
23-05-2019T00:14:58,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s still there but I’ve not been back since that last trip
23-05-2019T00:15:19,Ordithus,Was it good?
23-05-2019T00:15:47,SpazztasticKiwi,I only had grilled shrimp. My usual
23-05-2019T00:16:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Didn’t try anything that you’d test their abilities on
23-05-2019T00:24:15,SpazztasticKiwi,article of gag gifts heh
23-05-2019T00:28:24,SpazztasticKiwi,dadro’d have fun with one or two with that back n forth with his brother
23-05-2019T00:30:38,Dadrobit,"Just logged on for a sec, what's up?"
23-05-2019T00:31:00,Ordithus,Ye hath been summoned
23-05-2019T00:32:52,Dadrobit,"We're you around for my ""gag"" gift story with my brother a couple years back?"
23-05-2019T00:35:02,Ordithus,I was not
23-05-2019T00:35:41,Dadrobit,Gimme a sec
23-05-2019T00:41:15,SpazztasticKiwi,I just found a shop that decals names on mugs in dicks. Not a big thing but made me think of your little trading
23-05-2019T00:41:44,SpazztasticKiwi,and “pecker” lipsticks. Would only work if he was a sister instead
23-05-2019T00:42:07,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-MikeLewd:

23-05-2019T00:45:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Rhetorical question but they actually have those machines?
23-05-2019T00:45:59,Dadrobit,Of course.
23-05-2019T00:46:16,SpazztasticKiwi,~rhetorical~
23-05-2019T00:46:37,Ordithus,Don't ask questions if you don't want the answer
23-05-2019T00:46:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I said rhetorical before the question
23-05-2019T00:47:29,SpazztasticKiwi,I have found a few gag gifts I liked at Spencer’s
23-05-2019T00:47:44,Dadrobit,Saw a dalek sized one not too long ago that was being prototyped for medical use.
23-05-2019T00:47:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Though ones just a giant rainbow dick lollipop
23-05-2019T00:47:59,Bgrmystr2,"you say ""gag"" gift like you think some people out there don't actually buy them with the purpose of using them."
23-05-2019T00:48:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I know. Well aware
23-05-2019T00:48:49,Dadrobit,And I could definitely give him some pecker lipstick for when he goes to the ren fest as a bearded lady.
23-05-2019T00:49:10,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’m not stupid. It’s right next to rule 34. If that exists, the rule that anything can be a fetish exists"
23-05-2019T00:49:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Amazon sells the lipstick
23-05-2019T00:50:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"And thus if anything’s a fetish, people will make things to satisfy them"
23-05-2019T00:51:01,Dadrobit,See exhibit A: Furries
23-05-2019T00:52:21,SpazztasticKiwi,"On a calmer note, I may have found out something absolutely terrible"
23-05-2019T00:52:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I went for a run at the park today
23-05-2019T00:52:50,SpazztasticKiwi,And it was actually ⚡️ nice ⚡️

23-05-2019T00:57:51,Dadrobit,On my first cuppa joe for the night. Still 6.5 he's to go.
23-05-2019T00:58:10,Dadrobit,Hrs*
23-05-2019T01:01:33,SpazztasticKiwi,if you ever need to waste time YouTube
23-05-2019T01:04:00,Dadrobit,Not on 1 bar of 3G I'm not. Took me darn near ten minutes just to get to the TK forums and perform a search earlier.
23-05-2019T01:42:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Heh
23-05-2019T01:42:48,SpazztasticKiwi,I got 4g
23-05-2019T01:44:25,Dadrobit,I PAY for unlimited 4G. I get fuck all most of the time...
23-05-2019T01:45:20,SpazztasticKiwi,I get what I pay for
23-05-2019T01:45:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Unless it’s a pure dead spot. But that’s only when traveling
23-05-2019T01:46:04,Dadrobit,I got what I paid for with Verizon. I get jack sqaut for service with T Mobile.
23-05-2019T01:46:35,SpazztasticKiwi,picarto likes to crap out occasionally regardless
23-05-2019T01:47:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Like today after I sat down after run
23-05-2019T01:47:15,Dadrobit,"To be honest, I think it's because my phone originally came locked to Verizon. There are others up here with T Mobile that get fine service."
23-05-2019T01:47:38,SpazztasticKiwi,For some reason the app gave me a nope and I had to log in on web
23-05-2019T01:47:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Yet it was still from the phone
23-05-2019T01:48:14,SpazztasticKiwi,at&t
23-05-2019T01:57:32,SpazztasticKiwi,my scale says I’m 138ish

23-05-2019T12:35:44,AspiringNoodle,I can just imagine it now.  Basitins would be the perfect drivers.

23-05-2019T18:31:38,Bgrmystr2,I think my computer's psu is shot. May need to emergency psu from the store.
23-05-2019T18:31:48,Bgrmystr2,Fffffffuck
23-05-2019T18:40:46,AspiringNoodle,Oh geeze
23-05-2019T18:41:01,AspiringNoodle,I hope your PSU has the isolation failsafe
23-05-2019T18:41:32,AspiringNoodle,Anyone else have and old and/or failing computer?
23-05-2019T18:53:00,FloofyCat,I mean I have an old tower that I pulled stuff out of for my current one?
23-05-2019T18:53:12,FloofyCat,And my brother has one or two old machines at my parent's house in a shed.
23-05-2019T18:53:28,FloofyCat,As well as this old windows XP machine. I'm not sure if that even has ddr3 ;p
23-05-2019T18:54:29,FloofyCat,It only had like 512mb of RAM I think
23-05-2019T18:54:53,FloofyCat,"Maybe one day I'll take it, take the case off perhaps and maybe make a little art project out of it or something, I dunno."
23-05-2019T18:55:20,FloofyCat,Make some silly case for it that's light so I can hang it on a wall.
23-05-2019T18:55:34,FloofyCat,Hopefully also chuck in more RAM and maybe a cheap-ass video card.
23-05-2019T18:55:47,FloofyCat,Windows XP was a simpler time :p
23-05-2019T18:56:14,AspiringNoodle,One thing I love about technology
23-05-2019T18:56:42,FloofyCat,I'd kinda like to do that assuming I get a place.
23-05-2019T18:56:47,AspiringNoodle,The durability has gone waaaaaaaaaay up.  Stuff today can now easily last beyond its usefulness.  Hopefully that's not entirely the case with processors in the next few years ^^;
23-05-2019T18:57:03,FloofyCat,"I got a working Commodore Amiga A600, that survives a lot."
23-05-2019T18:57:08,AspiringNoodle,I'm soooooo freakin' hype for the new Zen processors from AMD!
23-05-2019T18:57:18,FloofyCat,... z... z-zen?
23-05-2019T18:57:30,AspiringNoodle,"Not that Zen, lol"
23-05-2019T18:57:39,FloofyCat,I bet Kat wants a Zen processor.
23-05-2019T18:58:07,AspiringNoodle,There was a leak yesterday / the day before.  A 12-core processor with a 5Ghz boost clock.
23-05-2019T18:58:13,FloofyCat,Sketch suggestion: Kat waits excitedly in line for the store to open to get a Zen processor
23-05-2019T18:58:22,AspiringNoodle,"Oh geeze, lmao"
23-05-2019T18:58:46,AspiringNoodle,Is his face gonna be on every box with a confused expression?
23-05-2019T18:58:56,AspiringNoodle,"""W...why am I here?"""
23-05-2019T18:59:01,FloofyCat,"I think urh... 7700Ks and up work at 5GHz just fine, just needs better cooling"
23-05-2019T18:59:23,AspiringNoodle,"From what I understand, 9th gen processors are the first to hit 5Ghz overclocks reliably."
23-05-2019T18:59:28,FloofyCat,Probably smirking with shiny teeth or something.
23-05-2019T18:59:43,FloofyCat,"Yeah, they hit 5GHz without issues and are stable."
23-05-2019T19:00:10,AspiringNoodle,"Anyways, like with any leak, it should be taken with a pinch of salt.  But when it comes to hardware, generally the closer to a reveal / launch at an conference, the more accurate it is."
23-05-2019T19:00:27,FloofyCat,I'm not too excited though
23-05-2019T19:00:41,FloofyCat,"Its going to be what, five more years until I even need to think about a CPU upgrade?"
23-05-2019T19:01:02,AspiringNoodle,I just want a processor that can last 5 - 10 years before I even need to CONSIDER an upgrade.
23-05-2019T19:01:59,AspiringNoodle,"And Zen 2 seems to be the perfect time to do it, since this will be a major performance upgrade for the product line."
23-05-2019T19:02:32,AspiringNoodle,"After this, it should be more akin to Intel's old upgrade cycle.  I'm curious as to how many cores consumer processors will offer in 5 years from now :)"
23-05-2019T19:03:58,FloofyCat,Tbf most new or new-ish CPUs abouts now will last for quite a while.
23-05-2019T19:04:39,AspiringNoodle,Indeed.  Single thread seems to be slowing to a crawl until we revolutionize production.
23-05-2019T19:04:52,AspiringNoodle,"The only way to feasibly go is multi-core, and who knows how long that will take."
23-05-2019T19:04:55,FloofyCat,Noodle at high-end gaming I reckon 6/8 cores in 5 years.
23-05-2019T19:05:33,AspiringNoodle,"To that I say, let's see what Zen 2 looks like.  It's extremely likely at this point that AMD will be offering 12 / 16 core processors for AM4."
23-05-2019T19:06:15,AspiringNoodle,"The price will play a major role in how fast higher core counts are adopted.  On top of performance, but leaks suggest greater than or equal to Intel offerings per thread :)"
23-05-2019T19:07:00,AspiringNoodle,"But I do agree, 8 cores in 5 years seems reasonable."
23-05-2019T19:07:07,FloofyCat,"AMD's stuff is going up in core counts so I'd imagine if games start to properly utilise that, Intel will follow."
23-05-2019T19:07:34,FloofyCat,I doubt lower-end Intel CPUs will have 8 cores in 5 years though
23-05-2019T19:07:44,AspiringNoodle,"Long ago, Intel and AMD made bets on how software would go.  Intel went single-core performance, AMD went multi-core."
23-05-2019T19:07:55,AspiringNoodle,"Intel won that bet, at first.  But it looks like AMD is getting the last laugh."
23-05-2019T19:09:16,AspiringNoodle,I still get a laugh thinking back to Intel saying we'd have 10Ghz processors in the 2010-2020 decade.
23-05-2019T19:11:26,FloofyCat,Lol
23-05-2019T19:11:35,FloofyCat,Are Intel planning on selling radiators?
23-05-2019T19:11:55,FloofyCat,10GHz will heat your home! :p
23-05-2019T19:12:28,FloofyCat,Hope you don't wanna play Arma 5 in the Summer because you'll make your room hot as Baghdad XD
23-05-2019T19:12:44,AspiringNoodle,"Intel would be wise to follow AMD's footsteps.  Afaik, Intel designs a single solid die for every processor.  From 2 cores to 18.  AMD has the modular design."
23-05-2019T19:13:04,AspiringNoodle,The modular design alows for higher yields.
23-05-2019T19:14:26,AspiringNoodle,"Also, I predict the future of processing will be multiple dies in everything.  You can only shrink in size so much."
23-05-2019T19:14:43,AspiringNoodle,Remember cell phones?  And how they kept making them smaller and smaller?  And then we got smart phones and the trend reversed.
23-05-2019T19:46:45,TeapotOfDoom,Am I guessing right when I say there was a new Zen 2 leak?
23-05-2019T19:48:08,TeapotOfDoom,Btw next big thing will probably be die stacking. At least Intel's working hard on that

23-05-2019T20:08:25,AspiringNoodle,"Um, considering one of the anime I enjoyed the most was ""The Everyday Tales of a Cat God,"" I'm going to say yes <3"
23-05-2019T20:08:41,SageSaga,nekos are just cats...
23-05-2019T20:09:00,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Grimoire of Zero has a actual cat dude.
23-05-2019T20:09:02,AspiringNoodle,Neko = Japanese for cat?
23-05-2019T20:09:16,SageSaga,this song is from Asobi Ni Ikuyo. and yes Neko = Cat
23-05-2019T20:09:39,SageSaga,"the ""English"" name for this anime was ""Cat Planet Cuties"""
23-05-2019T20:10:21,AspiringNoodle,"Welp, that's another one for my backlog"
23-05-2019T20:14:57,AspiringNoodle,This is the greatest time in history for entertainment.  It is also the worst time in history.
23-05-2019T20:15:03,AspiringNoodle,Pros:  You have ALL the choices :D
23-05-2019T20:15:14,AspiringNoodle,Cons:  You don't have ALL the time :(

23-05-2019T20:27:39,JeremySenpai,Dying from traditional anime troupe
23-05-2019T20:27:54,SageSaga,that's impossible
23-05-2019T20:28:07,JeremySenpai,lol
23-05-2019T20:28:16,SageSaga,anime troupes are just super refined - but no one has overdosed on them yet-
23-05-2019T20:28:25,SageSaga,was it cut with something else?
23-05-2019T20:28:56,JeremySenpai,Possible
23-05-2019T20:29:43,Sclimshady,Make sure your drugs are pure to avoid accidental overdoses
23-05-2019T20:30:27,JeremySenpai,:ptv-SteelwormHades: I have a cold
23-05-2019T20:30:28,SageSaga,i hear Japan is cutting a lot more of their anime with Incest stuff- ya gotta be careful
23-05-2019T20:30:37,Sclimshady,Oh no.
23-05-2019T20:31:03,SageSaga,"all that ""Oniichan!"" stuff will kill ya"
23-05-2019T20:31:13,AspiringNoodle,$5 says American corporations are responsible
23-05-2019T20:31:35,JeremySenpai,"""Onii-chan lets play suicide"""
23-05-2019T20:31:37,AspiringNoodle,Can't have that super naughty content in shows they aren't even funding.  Might not want to buy new series
23-05-2019T20:32:02,Sclimshady,5 bucks isnt enough to bribe out trade secrets like that
23-05-2019T20:32:10,AspiringNoodle,"Also, Japan's laws are horrible xD"
23-05-2019T20:32:34,AspiringNoodle,The censorship ones in particular would NEVER fly here in America.  They'd violate requirements.
23-05-2019T20:32:46,AspiringNoodle,legal requirements*
23-05-2019T20:33:08,Bgrmystr2,Random thought. I hate molex connectors.
23-05-2019T20:33:40,SageSaga,what do you have that uses them?
23-05-2019T20:34:09,Bgrmystr2,Literally all if my case fans. 5 total

23-05-2019T20:34:16,Bgrmystr2,Of*
23-05-2019T20:34:20,AspiringNoodle,I'm pretty sure molex connectors are the standard clippy bits for all computer cables xD
23-05-2019T20:34:37,AspiringNoodle,4/6/8/24 pin connectors and the like
23-05-2019T20:34:46,JeremySenpai,my psu has about 10 of them
23-05-2019T20:35:00,Bgrmystr2,No noodle xD

23-05-2019T20:35:25,Bgrmystr2,"They are standard though, but not that type"
23-05-2019T20:35:26,SageSaga,i thought they were the 4 pin straight across connectors
23-05-2019T20:35:58,Bgrmystr2,Yeah sage. Just fought one for 5 mins.. wires won't line up
23-05-2019T20:36:40,Sclimshady,Half of mine just never got plugged in because I gave up

23-05-2019T20:38:50,AspiringNoodle,"Make sure you're putting the square with a trimmed corner in the square with a trimmed corner hole, and not a sqaure in the square with a trimmed corner hole :ptv-snicker:"

23-05-2019T20:59:55,Tharkis,or order from shop and pick up in piitsburg?
23-05-2019T21:00:23,AspiringNoodle,Or order from the shop AND buy a copy in person? :P
23-05-2019T21:00:32,SageSaga,shop will be shipping only- so you're best off buying in person and saving 5-20 bucks :P
23-05-2019T21:00:54,Tharkis,okies =)
23-05-2019T21:01:51,Mippy,My only option is the shop....and $20 shipping....worth it :ptv-whiny::ptv-dealwithit:

23-05-2019T21:03:05,SageSaga,and it actually puts em over a pound
23-05-2019T21:03:46,Ordithus,That's a heavy book :ptv-ohmy:

23-05-2019T21:05:44,SageSaga,Harry Potter is actually only .7 pounds heavier
23-05-2019T21:06:07,SageSaga,and that is book 5 - Order of Phoenix
23-05-2019T21:06:28,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-rainehappy:*[That's half the weight of my fanfic #68]
23-05-2019T21:06:32,SageSaga,that is a 912 page book
23-05-2019T21:07:06,AspiringNoodle,My guess is the ink?

23-05-2019T21:07:41,Sclimshady,What is it? Lead ink?

23-05-2019T21:11:45,Bgrmystr2,Ah ok. I was somewhat expecting her iconic pose when you meet her in-game.

23-05-2019T21:13:00,SageSaga,oh I also got my new AC

23-05-2019T21:17:44,SageSaga,I would love to see Brightburn- but its too scary- i know because the trailer showed a woman removing a shard of glass from her eye- i cant handle that
23-05-2019T21:17:44,Mislakane,heyo
23-05-2019T21:17:44,Ordithus,Of course not :ptv-snicker:

23-05-2019T21:18:46,Mippy,Brightburn? This is what happens when I don't have cable. I  have no idea what is comming out
23-05-2019T21:19:04,AspiringNoodle,Imagine superman
23-05-2019T21:19:06,AspiringNoodle,but as a kid

23-05-2019T21:19:17,AspiringNoodle,And he's a homicidal maniac with the most terrifying outfit possible
23-05-2019T21:19:25,Mippy,XD
23-05-2019T21:19:33,AspiringNoodle,"Just a simple hoodie, but horizontal lacing down the front, and glowing, deep-red eyes"
23-05-2019T21:19:34,Mippy,Sounds funny
23-05-2019T21:19:52,SageSaga,watch the trailer Mippy
23-05-2019T21:20:07,SageSaga,the older one if ya dont want to see glass in someones eye

23-05-2019T21:21:33,AspiringNoodle,Not my fault they decided to hash the image name like 1000x
23-05-2019T21:21:47,AspiringNoodle,Simple naming conventions apparently do not exist
23-05-2019T21:21:56,Mippy,That is an interesting character designe. I love the gass masktype thing
23-05-2019T21:22:13,AspiringNoodle,"Doesn't it just scream ""I'm a mentally unstable serial killer in the making""?"
23-05-2019T21:22:16,Ordithus,Neat lil Tudor house
23-05-2019T21:22:56,AspiringNoodle,"That movie is gonna end one of two ways, I just know it"
23-05-2019T21:23:22,AspiringNoodle,"Either the kid is going to die (no freaking idea how, though)"
23-05-2019T21:23:33,AspiringNoodle,"Or (more likely) the more fun ""bad end"" deal"
23-05-2019T21:23:58,AspiringNoodle,The world now has evil Superman who has no qualms about killing and we're all screwed :ptv-hearts:
23-05-2019T21:24:24,BadFoMo,3rd floor windows in the right picture. ...OCD is Tingling!
23-05-2019T21:24:30,SageSaga,speaking of- we need a Specter movie
23-05-2019T21:26:44,AspiringNoodle,Random question:  How many of you played Super Mario 64 as a child?
23-05-2019T21:27:01,Mippy,"Back from Trailer watchig. I like it!  It's that ""What if Superman desided he hated humans?"" type thing"
23-05-2019T21:27:19,AspiringNoodle,^
23-05-2019T21:27:46,AspiringNoodle,I've already predicted the only 2 outcomes I think are likely to happen
23-05-2019T21:27:54,Mippy,I played Mario 64 when I could at friends houses. I could not afford a Nintendo 64
23-05-2019T21:27:55,AspiringNoodle,And the one is more of a 1:1000 bet.
23-05-2019T21:28:17,JeremySenpai,Mario 64 was my first 24hr gaming session
23-05-2019T21:29:02,AspiringNoodle,"awww, Mippy :("
23-05-2019T21:29:11,BadFoMo,"Same as Mippy, but it was at the Eagle's Nest at Giant Eagle."
23-05-2019T21:29:21,BadFoMo,...I think.
23-05-2019T21:29:28,AspiringNoodle,"I'm more of a ""late to the party"" type of gamer."
23-05-2019T21:29:56,AspiringNoodle,"The consoles I did get were like at the end of their lifespan, like right when next gen was coming out."
23-05-2019T21:30:00,Nekonny,I need to look more into how to draw buildings
23-05-2019T21:30:09,AspiringNoodle,NO
23-05-2019T21:30:18,AspiringNoodle,DRAW YOUR VISION!  Become the next great architect :D
23-05-2019T21:30:27,BadFoMo,@AspiringNoodle Same again.
23-05-2019T21:30:46,AspiringNoodle,I think the earliest I've been when it comes to consoles.
23-05-2019T21:31:01,AspiringNoodle,Was the Xbox One.  And I got it shortly before they released the X version xD
23-05-2019T21:31:31,AspiringNoodle,"Anyways, how much would you guys flip out if Nintendo ever decided to remaster SM64 for the Switch?  Or the console after it?"
23-05-2019T21:31:38,Tharkis,bleah my browser crashed and i never noticed !
23-05-2019T21:31:42,Nekonny,it helps when you have a foundation...

23-05-2019T22:34:59,ContagiousBordem16,Why not just leave the cape white it looks amazing like how it is
23-05-2019T22:35:12,SageSaga,it also makes it easier to animate and draw over and over

23-05-2019T22:40:23,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-redrose:*[There will be NO questions] (I kid)
23-05-2019T22:40:34,DarthRexKing,No questions about what?
23-05-2019T22:40:41,Sclimshady,Anything
23-05-2019T22:40:47,Bgrmystr2,"welcome to the chat, you should scroll up xD"
23-05-2019T22:40:57,zanAspera,Hey zat vus a kvestion!
23-05-2019T22:41:00,ContagiousBordem16,If rose was own by traces old ms. How come she hasn’t been released
23-05-2019T22:41:14,Ordithus,She wasn't owned by Saria
23-05-2019T22:41:18,ContagiousBordem16,Oh
23-05-2019T22:41:29,Bgrmystr2,well.. Rose DID say she belonged to Saria.
23-05-2019T22:41:32,Bgrmystr2,so... I dunno?
23-05-2019T22:41:36,ContagiousBordem16,Yeah
23-05-2019T22:41:42,Ordithus,...
23-05-2019T22:41:49,ContagiousBordem16,Is she still bound to the legacy’s
23-05-2019T22:41:54,Sclimshady,Ownership would still go to Trace upon her death
23-05-2019T22:41:54,zanAspera,Cuz being 'owned' by Trace gives her some protection.
23-05-2019T22:42:10,Bgrmystr2,Saria's death kind of probably prevented Rose's release. Probably.
23-05-2019T22:42:17,Bgrmystr2,Potentially.
23-05-2019T22:42:20,ContagiousBordem16,Protection from what?
23-05-2019T22:42:29,Sclimshady,Templars
23-05-2019T22:42:32,ContagiousBordem16,She freely talks to euchre
23-05-2019T22:42:40,ContagiousBordem16,Who is a Templar
23-05-2019T22:42:48,zanAspera,She's certainly freer as a 'slave' currently zan if she was free
23-05-2019T22:43:07,Ordithus,That whole evil organization trying to manipulate a war between the wolves and humans?
23-05-2019T22:43:22,Ordithus,"Also a magical guild, of sorts"
23-05-2019T22:43:22,zanAspera,If you didn't notice zey declared vor on us volfs
23-05-2019T22:43:26,Sclimshady,She's also kind of a god in that masion
23-05-2019T22:43:59,AspiringNoodle,Especially since Trace removed her restrictions
23-05-2019T22:44:10,ContagiousBordem16,She can use instant transmission to appear anywhere
23-05-2019T22:44:15,AspiringNoodle,The Mansion is now a pocket dimension.  Abandon all hope ye who enter.
23-05-2019T22:44:21,Nekonny,"ok, I think thats it for me ^^'"

23-05-2019T22:47:25,ContagiousBordem16,Remember when natani was pummeled by the muscular basitin back on the isles. Who was the basitin that blew up that guy?
23-05-2019T22:47:56,Sclimshady,"Sirius. the master spy, probably"
23-05-2019T22:48:31,Ordithus,[He scary]*:ctwokinds-nataniAAAAshake:
23-05-2019T22:48:32,Sclimshady,That period should have been a comma
23-05-2019T22:48:38,CrimsonHelsing,It was definitely him
23-05-2019T22:48:57,ContagiousBordem16,But he wasn’t there during the fights though
23-05-2019T22:49:02,zanAspera,"I bit him, he blew up"
23-05-2019T22:49:19,ContagiousBordem16,It looked like adelaides hand though
23-05-2019T22:49:24,ContagiousBordem16,Her daughters
23-05-2019T22:49:27,Sclimshady,Im 99% sure it was him but it wasn't explicitly stated so there's always a chance.
23-05-2019T22:49:40,zanAspera,I did it.
23-05-2019T22:49:49,ContagiousBordem16,Sage help
23-05-2019T22:49:57,ContagiousBordem16,I’m cofuuuzed
23-05-2019T22:50:18,Sclimshady,:ctwokinds-natsducky:
23-05-2019T22:50:31,ContagiousBordem16,No don’t eat the duck
23-05-2019T22:50:35,SageSaga,?
23-05-2019T22:50:39,Bgrmystr2,"It was him yeah, Contagious"
23-05-2019T22:50:41,ContagiousBordem16,Bad natani
23-05-2019T22:50:44,Bgrmystr2,it's been confirmed here and there
23-05-2019T22:50:46,zanAspera,it might explode!
23-05-2019T22:50:48,Sclimshady,eats the duck
23-05-2019T22:50:52,SageSaga,what are you confused by?
23-05-2019T22:50:54,Bgrmystr2,rip duck
23-05-2019T22:51:23,Sclimshady,:ctwokinds-natsducky:*[yum]
23-05-2019T22:51:32,ContagiousBordem16,Nvm I was confused by some story piece of TK but I got the answer
23-05-2019T22:51:50,CrimsonHelsing,"Sirus used magic to do it. And the basitin had too any similarities in physical features to be anyone but Sirus. I can see him, being the master spy, being a master of transformation magic to change species as a cover. And subsequently covering his tracks"
23-05-2019T22:51:59,CrimsonHelsing,After he's done with what he needs to do
23-05-2019T22:52:14,ContagiousBordem16,But why would he help them
23-05-2019T22:52:16,Sclimshady,He was also the tavern keep im pretty sure
23-05-2019T22:52:33,Sclimshady,Or rather the Inn
23-05-2019T22:52:37,ContagiousBordem16,Idk it’s getting confusing for me
23-05-2019T22:52:43,CrimsonHelsing,That is his exact cover
23-05-2019T22:52:52,Kameloh,evening :wave:
23-05-2019T22:52:56,ContagiousBordem16,Omg crimson

23-05-2019T22:53:58,Mislakane,yo
23-05-2019T22:54:05,Bgrmystr2,I don't recall if we know what exactly those interests are
23-05-2019T22:54:15,CrimsonHelsing,"Why help? Well Euchre's plans don't exactly involve Trace or his friends,or even the woman he loves,getting killed or having them separated beyond reach (so to speak.) My guess is he intervened to prevent that"
23-05-2019T22:54:18,Bgrmystr2,just that it gets him closer to what he wants.
23-05-2019T22:54:25,Bgrmystr2,whatever that happens to be.
23-05-2019T22:54:28,Sclimshady,He's working with Eucre right?
23-05-2019T22:54:30,ContagiousBordem16,I made a character that might be to op  because she can bend color
23-05-2019T22:54:48,CrimsonHelsing,Yes Sclim

23-05-2019T22:55:34,Ordithus,"Good, glad to have a long weekend ahead :ctwokinds-daydreamingkat:"
23-05-2019T22:55:58,w0lfmare,Kame :cw0lfmare-HeadEmber:
23-05-2019T22:56:05,Kameloh,w0lf :ckameloh-bongocat_50:
23-05-2019T22:56:11,ContagiousBordem16,Well I mean op as in like she could literally bend your blood right through you. And can cut the sky and slam it onto the surface
23-05-2019T22:56:58,Bgrmystr2,then it's not color she can manipulate lol
23-05-2019T22:57:10,FoxxTrotter,"Hiya, w0lf."
23-05-2019T22:57:19,w0lfmare,Foxx o/
23-05-2019T22:57:28,Ordithus,:cw0lfmare-EmberShockFlip: w0lf!
23-05-2019T22:57:28,ContagiousBordem16,Color bend and minipulation
23-05-2019T22:57:39,Kameloh,XD
23-05-2019T22:57:39,SageSaga,that doesnt make sense at all
23-05-2019T22:57:40,w0lfmare,Ord! :cw0lfmare-EmberShock2:
23-05-2019T22:57:45,ContagiousBordem16,Wolf sup
23-05-2019T22:57:45,zanAspera,*woofhugs Wolfmare*
23-05-2019T22:57:55,Kameloh,now I just want w0lf's emotes
23-05-2019T22:58:06,FoxxTrotter,"Issa yinglet. Hi, Zan."
23-05-2019T22:58:22,Ordithus,:moneybag::cw0lfmare-Paperembercool:
23-05-2019T22:58:34,Bgrmystr2,"being able to change the color of something will not allow you to manipulate blood or do anything with the sky, even if the sky was a physical object you could throw somewhere.. like the ground lol"
23-05-2019T22:58:54,zanAspera,herro so foxxy yinglet!   *yingclings to Foxx
23-05-2019T22:58:54,Bgrmystr2,"color is entirely visual, it's a spectrum of light"
23-05-2019T22:59:42,ContagiousBordem16,She cuts the color of the sky and slam it like mass onto everyone
23-05-2019T23:00:00,SageSaga,but color has no mass
23-05-2019T23:00:02,ContagiousBordem16,Light is mass though
23-05-2019T23:00:17,SageSaga,light is not mass
23-05-2019T23:00:31,SageSaga,if it was we would all be dead
23-05-2019T23:00:35,Ordithus,Photons don't have mass
23-05-2019T23:00:38,ContagiousBordem16,It is because that’s how you feel the rays of the sun
23-05-2019T23:00:53,Ordithus,That's thermal radiation
23-05-2019T23:00:55,SageSaga,i would shine a flashlight at you and you would explode killing everything on the planet
23-05-2019T23:00:56,Bgrmystr2,"that's not light, bro, that's radiation lol"
23-05-2019T23:00:56,Sclimshady,Thats energy
23-05-2019T23:01:21,Bgrmystr2,"radiation is invisible, you can't see it"
23-05-2019T23:01:37,ContagiousBordem16,Oh
23-05-2019T23:01:50,Ordithus,Unless it is electromagnetic radiation within the wavelengths of visible light :ptv-sneakysmirk:
23-05-2019T23:01:52,JeremySenpai,makes the neighbors listen to rolling girl as well
23-05-2019T23:01:57,Bgrmystr2,"that's terrifying, sage lol"
23-05-2019T23:02:11,SageSaga,that's light speed weapons
23-05-2019T23:02:19,ContagiousBordem16,Well I got a story element that might need fixing though
23-05-2019T23:02:29,Mihari,About the only thing a character that can control colour could do would be ghetto invisibility XD
23-05-2019T23:02:31,Bgrmystr2,might maybe possibly potentially lol
23-05-2019T23:02:32,zanAspera,"Energy and mass are different forms of ze same zing, yesyes.. but yes, technically color is a perception of ze frquency of photons"
23-05-2019T23:02:43,Bgrmystr2,lol mihari yeah
23-05-2019T23:02:51,SageSaga,any amount of mass moving at relativistic speeds means fusion
23-05-2019T23:03:12,Bgrmystr2,"if it were powerful enough, maybe they could change what other people see, making the ground or buildings invisible to others.."
23-05-2019T23:03:40,Ordithus,"Or just make psychedelic laser light shows, with their MIND"
23-05-2019T23:03:41,SageSaga,now i think what you are referencing for a power is something like Reality Warping powers
23-05-2019T23:03:57,Bgrmystr2,lol ord xD
23-05-2019T23:04:02,Ordithus,"Which would be cool in its own right.  Maybe not that practical, but cool"
23-05-2019T23:04:20,ContagiousBordem16,There a book that can bring tragedy. But in order to make it happen they need to play the music notes exactly stated on the top of the pages. So it literally playing out tragedy
23-05-2019T23:04:21,SageSaga,"so you would ""cut the sky"" and make it fall- you are actually turning the visual image of the sky into something physical"
23-05-2019T23:04:58,ContagiousBordem16,Oh
23-05-2019T23:05:02,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, what sage said"
23-05-2019T23:05:04,ContagiousBordem16,Jeez
23-05-2019T23:05:15,ContagiousBordem16,Yeah
23-05-2019T23:05:24,ContagiousBordem16,I need to fix that
23-05-2019T23:05:58,SageSaga,in Infinity war they do a decent job showing Reality warping powers
23-05-2019T23:06:16,AspiringNoodle,"Illusion magic is the most OP, change my mind."
23-05-2019T23:06:36,ContagiousBordem16,Illusion is still an illusion though
23-05-2019T23:06:48,AspiringNoodle,Gotta expand your horizons ;D
23-05-2019T23:06:54,SageSaga,i think any power that affects time and space is probably more OP than illusions but- i love me some illusion magic
23-05-2019T23:07:07,Bgrmystr2,"truth, sage"
23-05-2019T23:07:21,AspiringNoodle,Here's why I think illusion magic is the most OP.  Illusion magic affects perception.
23-05-2019T23:07:24,ContagiousBordem16,Life is strange can expand then
23-05-2019T23:07:34,AspiringNoodle,A person's change in perception is no different than a change in reality.
23-05-2019T23:07:51,Bgrmystr2,"noodle, there's so many more powerful things than just illusion. That only affects perception, not actual reality"
23-05-2019T23:07:55,Ordithus,"Now, if your ""color bender"" was actually able to manipulate the frequency of electromagnetic radiation, to the point of turning visible light into microwaves... they could cook their enemies :O"
23-05-2019T23:08:07,SageSaga,any time you screw with time and space you get some crazy reactions- also just manipulating it - well we know the universe does everything it can to stop anything within it from going faster than light
23-05-2019T23:08:21,zanAspera,"Yummy, cooked badbuys!"
23-05-2019T23:08:23,SpazztasticKiwi,I just read some signs nonsense and all I want to ask is how does one accomplish this personality trait “flirts aggressively”
23-05-2019T23:08:26,ContagiousBordem16,She can manipulate the color to whatever she wants
23-05-2019T23:08:40,ContagiousBordem16,Kiwi 🥝 sup
23-05-2019T23:08:44,SageSaga,you know what else can do that?
23-05-2019T23:08:48,SageSaga,Prestidigitation
23-05-2019T23:08:53,Bgrmystr2,"that's not a personality trait, kiwi, that's an action. Not sure how someone would DO that, but yknow."
23-05-2019T23:09:00,JeremySenpai,Urhg.........
23-05-2019T23:09:11,ContagiousBordem16,Jeremy’s back

23-05-2019T23:10:05,Ordithus,I'd accept the compliment
23-05-2019T23:10:06,Bgrmystr2,"cuz he's that, kiwi"

23-05-2019T23:13:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Half consist of people trying to get much closer than reasonable and saying “wow they’re green”
23-05-2019T23:13:43,ContagiousBordem16,"Would I be making a character to op if he could manipulate anything spiritual, physical, godly, and or reality"

23-05-2019T23:16:49,Apostrophe,Leave Nibs in there long enough and the furniture will rotate back to the correct position
23-05-2019T23:16:56,ContagiousBordem16,Ms nibby would attack my guests
23-05-2019T23:16:57,Ordithus,5 degrees is enough to notice gosh darnit
