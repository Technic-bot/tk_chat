20-03-2019T13:51:18,Twokinds,Well character development requires some sort of motivating factor

20-03-2019T13:53:25,Bgrmystr2,yeah exactly ord
20-03-2019T13:53:36,CrimsonHelsing,"The more I think about it... did you take any inspiration from the Sierra Madre casino when thinking up the concept and backstory of the estate, Tom? Because it's sounding increasingly like the estate has a good portion of it designed just for Saria"
20-03-2019T13:53:52,Twokinds,I hadn't considered as such
20-03-2019T13:54:57,Ordithus,Raine's lil peek is adorable
20-03-2019T13:55:19,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Raine ""Oh no the weirdo is here."""
20-03-2019T13:55:26,NazaPaLaRaza,Succ
20-03-2019T13:58:17,Bgrmystr2,I'm guessing that Maren was around the same size as Saria since the swimsuit fits. Did she even have a swimsuit while they were traveling?
20-03-2019T13:58:59,MarvTheHugPharaoh,not when they were out and about
20-03-2019T13:59:06,Ordithus,Maren? They ran away quickly and sold her dress to afford supplies
20-03-2019T13:59:14,Bgrmystr2,yeah
20-03-2019T13:59:28,Bgrmystr2,so I'm assuming the swimsuit is also Saria's
20-03-2019T13:59:47,Ordithus,Maren really is a lot like Saria
20-03-2019T13:59:56,Twokinds,Yeah all these new clothes are raided from the estate
20-03-2019T13:59:58,Ordithus,Could be why Trace had an interest in her
20-03-2019T14:00:34,Twokinds,"So, either Trace, Saria, or one of the servants or guests."
20-03-2019T14:00:54,Bgrmystr2,"it's good to know that Maren found an outfit that fits her. That seems like a common problem, wearing each other's clothing lol"
20-03-2019T14:01:02,Bgrmystr2,esp stuff like swimsuits

20-03-2019T14:02:25,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I won't mind if he didn't have anything on
20-03-2019T14:03:12,Twokinds,Honestly she probably did insist that
20-03-2019T14:03:15,Ordithus,I can't help but notice Maren's fantasy of him is a bit more buff
20-03-2019T14:03:34,Twokinds,Keidran don't tend to wear anything when swimming. Fur is heavy enough as it is.
20-03-2019T14:03:39,Twokinds,Most Keidran can't swim.
20-03-2019T14:04:03,ColeRusz,good to know
20-03-2019T14:04:14,Ordithus,I suppose the coastal foxes would be an exception to that

20-03-2019T14:11:21,MrEase,gonna take a shot in the dark and guess this is gonna lead into the april fools joke
20-03-2019T14:12:12,CrimsonHelsing,I've actually been playing a lot of Fallout in recent years honestly
20-03-2019T14:13:38,MrEase,"also sythe has shorts omg, when did this happen"
20-03-2019T14:13:40,BadFoMo,Raine's peeking through the crack makes me think of thoese parts of the story where the potagonest finds out their 'friend's' evil plans.
20-03-2019T14:13:47,Ordithus,Stolen
20-03-2019T14:15:16,CrimsonHelsing,"Oh God, what if they're still considering ratting out on Lyn'Knoll"
20-03-2019T14:16:04,CrimsonHelsing,"Nah, maybe not"

20-03-2019T14:18:23,MrEase,hey Cornthian
20-03-2019T14:20:50,MrEase,also I guess that means Maren hasn't gotten the memo that her sister nearly got beaten to death by a hunky statue
20-03-2019T14:21:14,Bgrmystr2,"well no, noone knows that but the two of them and Rose"
20-03-2019T14:21:23,Bgrmystr2,I don't think even Trace knows what happened to them yet
20-03-2019T14:21:30,Bgrmystr2,"other that ""Something bad happened"""
20-03-2019T14:21:39,Bgrmystr2,other than*
20-03-2019T14:23:32,BadFoMo,"@MrEase ...Is it bad if (at first glance) I thought you wrote 'Eaten', not 'Beaten'?"
20-03-2019T14:24:10,MrEase,no given what I draw thats a natural conclusion
20-03-2019T14:24:21,MrEase,"I mean uh, no thats very bad"
20-03-2019T14:24:27,Ordithus,"Maren's got some good expressions here.  From a bit embarassed with Sythe to excited to see her friend, Raine"
20-03-2019T14:25:37,Bgrmystr2,"yeah ord, they're subtle, but cute"
20-03-2019T14:29:57,BadFoMo,Is anyone else thinking that they might be talking about ditching the plan of going to Lyn'Knoll in faver of staying there?
20-03-2019T14:30:50,MrEase,I think thats actually the most likely possibility

20-03-2019T14:35:23,Bgrmystr2,the problem with that thought is that the estate is probably the hardest place for their enemies to get them.
20-03-2019T14:35:27,Ordithus,And then there is whatever that Eldritch horror is lurking away
20-03-2019T14:35:43,Bgrmystr2,anywhere else is fairly easy pickings. at least the state is defended

20-03-2019T14:36:35,CrimsonHelsing,"Well this is only from what I've always suspected, and Rose confirmed it, that the enemy will find a way in sooner or later"
20-03-2019T14:37:14,Bgrmystr2,"I get the feeling if Trace went to Lyn'Knoll, his enemies would follow him there and know where it is, then attack it to get to him."
20-03-2019T14:37:46,CrimsonHelsing,And holy fuck are Trace's former colleagues persistent xP
20-03-2019T14:37:54,CrimsonHelsing,Good point
20-03-2019T14:38:26,Ordithus,"Sythe and the brothers still have some folks interested in them, though"

20-03-2019T16:04:27,MarvTheHugPharaoh,your friend has goo taste
20-03-2019T16:04:30,Bgrmystr2,the only thing I wouldn't go with is a seagate HDD
20-03-2019T16:04:30,MarvTheHugPharaoh,good
20-03-2019T16:04:41,Mippy,Ruby Zen!
20-03-2019T16:04:44,Bgrmystr2,cuz they have a bad habit of dying
20-03-2019T16:04:54,SageSaga,seagate is fine - they arent that bad
20-03-2019T16:04:55,RimaDraws,he wanted to help me get an affordable pc and he helped me cause i am fretting over my laptop dying on me.
20-03-2019T16:04:59,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Bgr, Hdd is great for storing art and psds"
20-03-2019T16:05:00,Mippy,I give up
20-03-2019T16:05:11,RimaDraws,my laptop isnt gone yet but i wanna get the parts and build it before it does
20-03-2019T16:05:19,SageSaga,that went hard AMD- even going with an AMD Graphics card
20-03-2019T16:05:29,Bgrmystr2,"they're pretty solid drives sure, but more than 60% of every drive I've ever had to diagnose in the computer shop was a dead seagate"
20-03-2019T16:05:33,RimaDraws,i told him i wanted to game and art and he set me up
20-03-2019T16:06:01,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I think I have a seagate in mine thats still kicking
20-03-2019T16:06:10,MarvTheHugPharaoh,also have WD
20-03-2019T16:06:11,SageSaga,Well im not sure how that card will be for gaming
20-03-2019T16:06:32,SageSaga,yeah i have a bunch of seagates that still work- WD is better though
20-03-2019T16:06:55,MarvTheHugPharaoh,The 570 is a pretty beaty card sage
20-03-2019T16:06:59,Bgrmystr2,"yeh, solid tech, but I wouldn't trust the survivability or life expectancy"
20-03-2019T16:07:03,MarvTheHugPharaoh,beasty
20-03-2019T16:07:27,Bgrmystr2,I dunno what the radeon cards equate to for GTX
20-03-2019T16:07:28,SageSaga,I dont trust Bgrs anecdotes
20-03-2019T16:07:28,RimaDraws,well i am not doing hardcore gaming
20-03-2019T16:07:44,RimaDraws,i just play here and there. but its gonna be mostly for my art and for regular use
20-03-2019T16:07:54,Bgrmystr2,none of mine are anecdotes when I had to work at a computer shop and diagnose hard drives myself and test them lol
20-03-2019T16:07:57,RimaDraws,nothing mainstream
20-03-2019T16:07:59,Bgrmystr2,but call it what you like xD
20-03-2019T16:08:11,Bgrmystr2,I'm not the only one with that experience
20-03-2019T16:08:33,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Thats a pretty strong build for art pc,  Very nice"
20-03-2019T16:08:35,SageSaga,the 570 doesnt even match a 1060
20-03-2019T16:09:04,MarvTheHugPharaoh,which 1060?
20-03-2019T16:09:06,RimaDraws,like i said not for mainstream gaming. just indie games and such here and there
20-03-2019T16:09:15,MarvTheHugPharaoh,there are like 50 versions
20-03-2019T16:09:18,SageSaga,a 6GB 1060
20-03-2019T16:09:27,Ordithus,I thought an RX480 was pretty close to a 1060?
20-03-2019T16:09:40,MarvTheHugPharaoh,the 570 is a 4gb card.
20-03-2019T16:09:47,Bgrmystr2,"if it even matched a 900 series I'd consider it worth, cuz I'm still using a gtx 760 and I don't really have any issues running games"
20-03-2019T16:10:00,RimaDraws,but anyway. just thought id show you sage that i was getting my pc built
20-03-2019T16:10:18,MarvTheHugPharaoh,my 970 is still kicking ass at gaming
20-03-2019T16:10:42,Bgrmystr2,pity the 900 series didn't exist when I got my card.
20-03-2019T16:10:53,SageSaga,i would go the extra mile and go for a 1660Ti GTX
20-03-2019T16:11:17,SageSaga,it's over 50% faster
20-03-2019T16:11:20,RimaDraws,well ill have to converse with him
20-03-2019T16:11:23,Ordithus,"Eh, the first things I'd ""upgrade"" from Rima's build would be the PSU and memory"
20-03-2019T16:11:25,Ordithus,RAM
20-03-2019T16:11:43,Bgrmystr2,Aren't there Radeon cards with similar performance for cheaper than the 1660ti?
20-03-2019T16:11:53,SageSaga,dont think so Bgr
20-03-2019T16:11:58,SageSaga,Ord- you are right
20-03-2019T16:12:02,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"I'v heard a lot of people say the 1660 shouldn't even exist, like Jaystwocents said just go 1060"
20-03-2019T16:12:04,SageSaga,PSU could use a really easy upgrade
20-03-2019T16:12:06,Ordithus,To run that card she'd need more watts
20-03-2019T16:12:09,Bgrmystr2,"from a lot of tech videos I've watched recently, they say yes there are"
20-03-2019T16:12:21,Bgrmystr2,but I didn't check cuz I'm not too fussed with GPU prices atm
20-03-2019T16:12:28,Ordithus,"A 650+ gold psu doesn't cost that much more, and they are worth it"
20-03-2019T16:12:35,RimaDraws,hmm
20-03-2019T16:12:43,SageSaga,yeah Ord is right
20-03-2019T16:12:52,SageSaga,just worked on Toms build a few weeks back
20-03-2019T16:13:02,SageSaga,it was really easy to up the PSU and it didnt cost much more
20-03-2019T16:13:08,RimaDraws,so what on the list do i need to replace
20-03-2019T16:13:14,BadFoMo,"Back. Did Tom finish, get stuck, or rage quit?"
20-03-2019T16:13:20,Ordithus,Tom finished
20-03-2019T16:13:26,MarvTheHugPharaoh,^
20-03-2019T16:13:28,Ordithus,It was a glorious finish
20-03-2019T16:13:29,BadFoMo,Cool.
20-03-2019T16:13:59,RimaDraws,so is the pc not good?
20-03-2019T16:14:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,its great for what you want to do
20-03-2019T16:14:14,SageSaga,it could be better for not a huge investment more
20-03-2019T16:14:14,Ordithus,"I'd say it's fine, especially considering budgets"
20-03-2019T16:14:23,RimaDraws,i mean ts within my budge
20-03-2019T16:14:39,Mippy,*has no idea*
20-03-2019T16:14:45,SageSaga,like you can upgrade the PSU and probably stay in a budget - then upgrade the GPU later and add more ram
20-03-2019T16:14:49,RimaDraws,i am trying to stay within something that can just stream my art no prob
20-03-2019T16:14:55,Bgrmystr2,"great time to start learning, Mippy"
20-03-2019T16:15:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"That build will do that no prob, Rima"
20-03-2019T16:15:28,RimaDraws,sorry tech talk confuses me
20-03-2019T16:15:31,RimaDraws,lol
20-03-2019T16:15:47,Ordithus,"Wow, seriously though the kind of power you can get for $630 is pretty nice"
20-03-2019T16:15:57,Bgrmystr2,just go into it to learn and imagine each part like giant legos.. that are hundreds of dollars
20-03-2019T16:16:00,Bgrmystr2,and it works
20-03-2019T16:16:14,SageSaga,like normal legos
20-03-2019T16:16:21,Mippy,Is that list Rima posted a full computer?
20-03-2019T16:16:25,MarvTheHugPharaoh,that go in one way
20-03-2019T16:16:28,Bgrmystr2,"even though each lego is not even remotely that much, sage XD"
20-03-2019T16:16:44,SageSaga,might as well be- those suckers are expensive
20-03-2019T16:17:00,Bgrmystr2,You can get thousands of pieces for a few dozen dollars online
20-03-2019T16:17:02,Bgrmystr2,u wot
20-03-2019T16:17:18,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Rima, you can look up a Linus tech tips pc build on youtube and that will run you through all the bells and whistles"
20-03-2019T16:17:39,RimaDraws,he got me a video to help me set up
20-03-2019T16:17:43,RimaDraws,for when i get the parts
20-03-2019T16:17:50,SageSaga,probably knockoffs or used bricks then
20-03-2019T16:18:13,Ordithus,Are lego bricks more expensive than real bricks :thinking:
20-03-2019T16:18:28,Bgrmystr2,"1040 peice set for $26, 1100 for $33.."
20-03-2019T16:18:30,MarvTheHugPharaoh,they can be Ord
20-03-2019T16:18:34,RimaDraws,but yea i almost invested in something that was $1600 but my friend was like no no no we are building your
20-03-2019T16:18:37,RimaDraws,yours*
20-03-2019T16:18:54,Mippy,Is there a good YouTube channel about this stuff? Preferably informative and entertaining?
20-03-2019T16:19:12,Bgrmystr2,1500 lego piece set for $73 from lego themselves on amazon
20-03-2019T16:19:20,Bgrmystr2,"yeah no, not quite"
20-03-2019T16:19:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,using a pc you built feels so much better then one thats bought
20-03-2019T16:19:26,SageSaga,Rima- i would upgrade the PSU to something like this EVGA fully modular - https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817438121&Description=650w&cm_re=650w-_-17-438-121-_-Product
20-03-2019T16:20:16,RimaDraws,which part is that on my list?
20-03-2019T16:20:17,SageSaga,a higher grade PSU would be better but the price and its EVGA which has good customer service
20-03-2019T16:20:24,SageSaga,the Power Supply Unit
20-03-2019T16:20:28,Ordithus,"The power supply, the bottom one"
20-03-2019T16:20:45,Ordithus,It provides the delicous electrons
20-03-2019T16:20:58,Dadrobit,Back for a bit.
20-03-2019T16:21:03,MarvTheHugPharaoh,wb Dad
20-03-2019T16:21:06,RimaDraws,ooh i see it now
20-03-2019T16:21:07,Ordithus,wb for a bit
20-03-2019T16:21:14,RimaDraws,sorry its hard to tell with all these parts
20-03-2019T16:21:22,SageSaga,it will give you head room to upgrade later
20-03-2019T16:21:33,Dadrobit,Building computers? I'd recommend watching The Verge for a good comprehensive guide on building a computer.
20-03-2019T16:21:41,SageSaga,YOU SON OF A
20-03-2019T16:21:42,MarvTheHugPharaoh,dad no
20-03-2019T16:21:54,SageSaga,besides they took that trash down
20-03-2019T16:22:00,Bgrmystr2,lol they took it down already yeah
20-03-2019T16:22:03,Dadrobit,Did they really?
20-03-2019T16:22:04,MarvTheHugPharaoh,good
20-03-2019T16:22:12,Dadrobit,Wow. Any apologies?
20-03-2019T16:22:13,SageSaga,I recommend Linus Tech Tips or Jayz2cents
20-03-2019T16:22:18,MarvTheHugPharaoh,^
20-03-2019T16:22:20,Bgrmystr2,"they gave a halfass one, dadro"
20-03-2019T16:22:25,SageSaga,or if you want some super technical info- GamersNexus
20-03-2019T16:22:27,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Linus and Jay are great
20-03-2019T16:22:31,Dadrobit,Bitwit is also pretty good imo
20-03-2019T16:23:21,SageSaga,Jay will make you want to try watercooling
20-03-2019T16:23:40,MarvTheHugPharaoh,skunkworks did that to me hard
20-03-2019T16:24:01,Bgrmystr2,there was a video recently I saw of someone watercooling an air cooler
20-03-2019T16:24:12,Bgrmystr2,it was interesting
20-03-2019T16:24:23,Dadrobit,I'm sorry... But Skunkworks????
20-03-2019T16:24:27,SageSaga,my air cooler is the size of a baby
20-03-2019T16:24:34,SageSaga,Skunkworks is the name of one of his PCs
20-03-2019T16:24:50,SageSaga,was it originally Black and white?
20-03-2019T16:24:55,SageSaga,I know its Black and Green-
20-03-2019T16:25:02,Dadrobit,Ah. I have... Different mental associations with that name.
20-03-2019T16:25:16,Ordithus,Same
20-03-2019T16:25:17,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Black and white, to black and yellow, to black and green"
20-03-2019T16:26:47,SageSaga,Gamers Nexus is super into the technical side- they tear GPUs apart and show the chips and identify them and put out technical information on how to bypass power limiters and stuff like that
20-03-2019T16:27:07,SageSaga,you know- for crazy people
20-03-2019T16:27:26,MarvTheHugPharaoh,a little overkill for simple pc building but fun to watch
20-03-2019T16:27:38,Ordithus,"For those with spare time, money, and parts"
20-03-2019T16:27:40,Bgrmystr2,yeah they've got cool shit sage lol
20-03-2019T16:28:29,SageSaga,Linus is great for a ton of stuff but their PC building is pretty standard stuff- Jay does high end water cooling and talks about performance and does builds- he built Terry Crews pc
20-03-2019T16:28:46,SageSaga,and Steve from GamersNexus is hardcore hardware
20-03-2019T16:29:32,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"so Linus is level one, Jay is level 2, and steve is the final boss"
20-03-2019T16:29:51,Bgrmystr2,"well, I dunno. I don't think it's quite like that"
20-03-2019T16:30:00,SageSaga,nah it does
20-03-2019T16:30:46,SageSaga,there is a secret boss on the Linus team though - hes a guy Linus pays lots of money to because hes a software/networking guru that keeps the place running XD
20-03-2019T16:31:18,Bgrmystr2,is it that big dude that was helping linus require stuff recently
20-03-2019T16:31:21,Bgrmystr2,and was setting up the network
20-03-2019T16:31:21,SageSaga,yep
20-03-2019T16:31:31,Bgrmystr2,okay yeah I know who yer talkin bout
20-03-2019T16:31:37,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I like that guy
20-03-2019T16:31:40,Bgrmystr2,he seems pretty chill yeah
20-03-2019T16:31:41,SageSaga,hes cool
20-03-2019T16:31:57,SageSaga,it was funny to see him freaking out when they were doing a server cleanup
20-03-2019T16:32:03,Bgrmystr2,haha
20-03-2019T16:32:05,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
20-03-2019T16:32:23,SageSaga,"he was pretty calm but you could tell behind his eyes he was like ""did we kill 100k worth in equipment?"""
20-03-2019T16:32:26,Bgrmystr2,"Is he a recent addition? I don't actually know, I haven't watched all the videos"
20-03-2019T16:32:37,Bgrmystr2,recent I mean like.. within the past few months or so
20-03-2019T16:32:39,SageSaga,hes been around a while but he hasnt been shown a lot
20-03-2019T16:32:45,Bgrmystr2,ahh okay
20-03-2019T16:32:53,Bgrmystr2,I've only seen him in recent stuff
20-03-2019T16:32:56,SageSaga,they actually dont let anyone appear on camera until they have been around a while
20-03-2019T16:33:03,Bgrmystr2,but my watch history is spotty at best
20-03-2019T16:33:03,MarvTheHugPharaoh,like to see him in more videos.
20-03-2019T16:33:11,SageSaga,and he originally didnt want anything to do with being on camera
20-03-2019T16:33:17,Bgrmystr2,ahh okay
20-03-2019T16:33:19,Bgrmystr2,that makes sense
20-03-2019T16:33:26,SageSaga,but i think Linus convinced him to do more XD
20-03-2019T16:33:32,SageSaga,because he is a funny guy
20-03-2019T16:33:40,SageSaga,his dead pans are great
20-03-2019T16:33:40,Dadrobit,The big guy?
20-03-2019T16:33:47,Bgrmystr2,yeh dadro
20-03-2019T16:33:49,SageSaga,and he knows what hes talking about - yeah the big guy
20-03-2019T16:34:15,Dadrobit,"Honestly, the supporting cast of LTT are the best part in the videos they're in pretty much across the board."
20-03-2019T16:34:30,SageSaga,"i remember one scene where linus describes something and he looked over at him and said ""Isnt that right?"" and he just shook his head ""no"""
20-03-2019T16:34:39,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
20-03-2019T16:34:46,Bgrmystr2,haha
20-03-2019T16:34:59,SageSaga,im worried about Dennis
20-03-2019T16:35:04,SageSaga,that poor boy
20-03-2019T16:35:33,MarvTheHugPharaoh,whats up with Dennis?
20-03-2019T16:35:47,SageSaga,he's really dumb and awkward
20-03-2019T16:36:02,MarvTheHugPharaoh,But he's so lovable tho
20-03-2019T16:36:05,SageSaga,true
20-03-2019T16:36:54,SageSaga,and he can edit and he speaks several languages i think
20-03-2019T16:37:25,SageSaga,but when it comes to like-- omg man he watches the Office over and over-
20-03-2019T16:38:14,SageSaga,"Linus was like ""Have you seen LotR?"" ""No I dont know what that is"" ""What do you watch?"" ""The Office"" ""The US or the UK?"" ""What's the UK?"""
20-03-2019T16:38:25,Bgrmystr2,xD
20-03-2019T16:38:42,SageSaga,"""Do you watch anything else?"" ""Not really, I just watch the Office"""
20-03-2019T16:39:12,RimaDraws,lol
20-03-2019T16:39:17,SageSaga,he's so weird-
20-03-2019T16:40:09,SageSaga,"""So is the network running faster now?"" Dennis- ""I think it is"" *Everyone else in the room shaking their heads no*"
20-03-2019T16:41:00,SageSaga,hes one of those people that if you tell them Red goes faster- they will wear a red shirt to get to work faster
20-03-2019T16:41:51,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Gotta run, see ya'll <3"
20-03-2019T16:42:01,Bgrmystr2,seeya marv
20-03-2019T16:42:11,RimaDraws,bye marv
20-03-2019T16:42:33,SageSaga,I gotta go too- take care folks
20-03-2019T16:42:51,Bgrmystr2,"ah okay, seeya sage"
20-03-2019T16:42:59,SageSaga,peace folks! take care!
20-03-2019T16:43:01,RimaDraws,take care sage
20-03-2019T16:43:43,Dadrobit,Have a good one all y'all
20-03-2019T16:57:04,SpazztasticKiwi,I can see in my toe
20-03-2019T17:02:52,Ordithus,How bad did you cut your toe :ptv-confused:
20-03-2019T17:06:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Enough I need a butterfly stitch to stick and hold the two halves back together
20-03-2019T17:07:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I told my mother - who insists it will mend together just find without - that I‚Äôm going to the doctor tomorrow if it doesn‚Äôt improve
20-03-2019T17:07:40,SpazztasticKiwi,fine
20-03-2019T17:07:45,Ordithus,good plan
20-03-2019T17:07:52,Ordithus,It doesn't look infected at all?
20-03-2019T17:07:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Nah
20-03-2019T17:07:58,Ordithus,Good.
20-03-2019T17:08:05,Ordithus,"If it does, ever, go straight to a doctor."
20-03-2019T17:08:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Clean red blood and flesh all round
20-03-2019T17:09:25,Ordithus,yay?
20-03-2019T17:10:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Yes yay. Means it‚Äôs clean of any shards n dirt
20-03-2019T17:11:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Do know I‚Äôm technically first aid certified
20-03-2019T17:12:11,Ordithus,Good!  I didn't know.
20-03-2019T17:12:14,Ordithus,Now I know
20-03-2019T17:12:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Makes me wonder if I do want to try being a nurse
20-03-2019T17:13:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"Cause the course I took covered nasty broken bones, gore, split wide open skin"
20-03-2019T17:13:39,SpazztasticKiwi,And I was like ‚Äúmeh‚Äù
20-03-2019T17:57:27,Bgrmystr2,"yeah I still think you should visit a doctor, to hell with what your mom says. If you have to actually ask yourself whether you should see a doctor about it, that's the sign to go see one."
20-03-2019T18:10:13,CrRAR,Slather some neosporin on it it'll heal up mighty :ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
20-03-2019T18:10:37,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
20-03-2019T18:10:49,Bgrmystr2,yes we all do that every time we cut off a limb too.
20-03-2019T18:11:16,CrRAR,What happened by the way? Sounds pretty gnarly.
20-03-2019T18:11:23,CrRAR,lol bgr
20-03-2019T18:11:52,Bgrmystr2,she stepped on glass and bled to death.
20-03-2019T18:11:56,Bgrmystr2,talking to us from the afterlife.
20-03-2019T18:12:01,Bgrmystr2,they apparently have wifi up there.
20-03-2019T18:12:09,Bgrmystr2,Who knew? :ptv-wondering:
20-03-2019T18:14:57,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs pretty dope
20-03-2019T18:15:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"God says if you must seat tho, use your own name"

20-03-2019T18:32:14,CrRAR,"lol @ today's comic, Raine be snooping around to find more fuel for her fanfic fire."
20-03-2019T18:32:24,CrRAR,:fire:
20-03-2019T18:37:38,CrRAR,Now imagine she poofs into wolf form rn.
20-03-2019T18:37:46,CrRAR,Her snout would probably smack the door open.
20-03-2019T18:38:04,CrRAR,:bangbang:
20-03-2019T18:38:09,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-eyeroll:
20-03-2019T18:39:37,Bgrmystr2,She may still be recovering magic though
20-03-2019T18:39:58,CrRAR,"oh, true"

20-03-2019T18:40:31,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-RaineEep:

20-03-2019T18:40:49,Bgrmystr2,"we don't exactly know how long it would take her to recover all of her magic, and once she gains enough, she'll prolly turn back into a keidran since she doesn't know how to not do that yet"
20-03-2019T18:41:00,Bgrmystr2,lack of control and stuff
20-03-2019T18:41:21,RimaDraws,so some art is getting done thank god.
20-03-2019T18:41:22,Bgrmystr2,though perhaps the thing with carver helped

20-03-2019T18:54:07,Mippy,"So, in other news my Digital Design teacher knows I‚Äôm a furry...now he wants me to make a info graphic about the fandom because he is curious"
20-03-2019T18:54:31,Bgrmystr2,uh. that's a rather large hole to jump down.
20-03-2019T18:55:24,Mippy,:ptv-confused: Yeah...I have new idea where to start. Maybe some history?
20-03-2019T18:55:53,Bgrmystr2,http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/132/ the 5th panel on this page prettymuch sums up the fandom in a nutshell.
20-03-2019T18:56:35,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
20-03-2019T18:56:41,Mippy,XD That was a while back

20-03-2019T18:58:10,Bgrmystr2,"also, that top definition is arguably the most accurate"
20-03-2019T18:58:29,Mippy,Actually I‚Äôm a bit more like Keith here Random Person: How do you know all this stuff about furries?    Mippy: None of your buisness
20-03-2019T18:59:56,Mippy,That page is actually quite entertaining Terra.
20-03-2019T19:01:45,Mippy,"Well, gotta get back to work....ugh!...it never ends"

20-03-2019T19:29:45,Bgrmystr2,they can't not accept doctor's orders
20-03-2019T19:29:47,Bgrmystr2,legally.
20-03-2019T19:29:48,Bgrmystr2,they cannot
20-03-2019T19:30:25,Bgrmystr2,"if you have a medical reason for needing something or other they can't bar you from that thing, that's worker endangerment"
20-03-2019T19:35:30,Bgrmystr2,https://archive.attn.com/stories/17519/walmart-just-got-caught-violating-workers-rights
20-03-2019T21:50:30,Bgrmystr2,"Wow, goin back to the stream recording, I didn't miss much of anything"

20-03-2019T21:55:38,RimaDraws,in a way
20-03-2019T22:00:17,RimaDraws,it is going to take time for me to get used to making concept art
20-03-2019T23:16:36,RimaDraws,night all!!!
