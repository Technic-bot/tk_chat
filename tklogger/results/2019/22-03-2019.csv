22-03-2019T00:00:48,MatyMaty,I've actually been playing on how to do muzzles
22-03-2019T00:00:51,Ordithus,By the headless doggo on Ron's stream?
22-03-2019T00:00:51,unsteddyphoenix,Those...ear tufts
22-03-2019T00:01:04,MarvTheHugPharaoh,They are pretty cute

22-03-2019T00:01:07,Nekonny,oh?
22-03-2019T00:01:10,Supahbuzzer,"just fully transform, raine. it's no big deal... :'("
22-03-2019T00:01:13,Masterzooka,*someone
22-03-2019T00:01:19,Doebuns,ear tufts <3
22-03-2019T00:01:28,ScorpDK,Nuzzles be hard.
22-03-2019T00:01:30,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Maty, how do muzzles?"
22-03-2019T00:01:32,ScorpDK,Also muzzles.
22-03-2019T00:01:39,Bgrmystr2,"it is a big deal, Supah, that's the thing."
22-03-2019T00:01:40,NezumiYuki,Speaking of muzzles.... How Does Feline Muzzle?  xD   I just can't seem to feline too well.... Derp!
22-03-2019T00:01:42,Bgrmystr2,She can't control it.
22-03-2019T00:01:42,unsteddyphoenix,nuzzles~
22-03-2019T00:01:44,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Ok thats adorable
22-03-2019T00:01:47,MarvTheHugPharaoh,maty
22-03-2019T00:01:52,Mihari,Not bad.
22-03-2019T00:01:54,unsteddyphoenix,Hey thats pretty good isnt it?
22-03-2019T00:01:55,Doebuns,I like nuzzles and muzzles
22-03-2019T00:01:58,Doebuns,and huggles <w< <3
22-03-2019T00:01:59,Ordithus,Cute!
22-03-2019T00:02:15,swack24,Raine is Halfkind!
22-03-2019T00:02:15,ScorpDK,Evolution.
22-03-2019T00:02:20,Mihari,"Still a bit small, but certainly better."
22-03-2019T00:02:25,MatyMaty,Thanks!
22-03-2019T00:02:35,Doebuns,Matymaty art is very cute <3
22-03-2019T00:02:42,MrRetroRealm,You're doing great Maty :D
22-03-2019T00:02:44,Masterzooka,@ swack24 *takes of sunglasses* dear god...
22-03-2019T00:02:50,Masterzooka,*off
22-03-2019T00:02:51,MatyMaty,not sure if that would be a feline muzzle or a canine one
22-03-2019T00:02:52,MarvTheHugPharaoh,smaller muzzles is better then over long muzzles
22-03-2019T00:02:58,unsteddyphoenix,Feline I would think
22-03-2019T00:03:19,Mihari,I'd probably have to be smaller and wider to be a feline
22-03-2019T00:03:20,NezumiYuki,Awww but but but... Tom's foxes and wolves... Dem cute long muzzles!
22-03-2019T00:03:26,MrRetroRealm,Who's this @MatyMaty?
22-03-2019T00:03:38,MatyMaty,"just a random test, Retro"
22-03-2019T00:03:40,Masterzooka,joint streamer
22-03-2019T00:03:43,Mihari,BUT! If you changed the ears it could be a bat!
22-03-2019T00:03:43,MrRetroRealm,Neato
22-03-2019T00:03:47,MrRetroRealm,Looks nice
22-03-2019T00:03:56,MrRetroRealm,Keep up the good work ;)
22-03-2019T00:03:58,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Fruit bat \o/
22-03-2019T00:04:05,MatyMaty,don't bats have noses kinda like pigs? :O
22-03-2019T00:04:15,Mihari,Depends on the bat
22-03-2019T00:04:21,MrRetroRealm,I think it varies on the species
22-03-2019T00:04:21,Masterzooka,omg i think my dog is snoring
22-03-2019T00:04:30,ScorpDK,"personally I feel it is more important to shape the nose accordingly (tho I hate bat noses, they look gross :V)"
22-03-2019T00:04:38,Mihari,XD
22-03-2019T00:04:42,SteelDragonFist,mhm
22-03-2019T00:04:44,NezumiYuki,"Some do, Maty, but I think everyone loves to use fruit bat faces more often."
22-03-2019T00:04:53,SageSaga,there are cute bats
22-03-2019T00:04:58,Mihari,Ferret then?
22-03-2019T00:04:58,Chalodraws,indeed
22-03-2019T00:05:11,Masterzooka,aw hes so relaxed
22-03-2019T00:05:12,MarvTheHugPharaoh,We need more Ferrets
22-03-2019T00:05:13,ScorpDK,People drawing Rouge the Bat with a more realistic nose just has me covering in the corner holding up a cross to my screen.
22-03-2019T00:05:17,MatyMaty,ferrets are bad to draw
22-03-2019T00:05:17,Twokinds,Finally done sketching this

22-03-2019T00:05:31,MatyMaty,I don't like drawing face markings XD
22-03-2019T00:05:33,Doebuns,also hello :3
22-03-2019T00:05:33,Masterzooka,THE LORD HAS SPOKEN
22-03-2019T00:05:34,NezumiYuki,"Looks good there, Tom!"

22-03-2019T00:05:48,MuonNeutrino,that's gotta be awkward as heck
22-03-2019T00:05:49,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Ferrets are adorable
22-03-2019T00:05:57,ScorpDK,"facial markings are difficult. They make or break the face, too XD"
22-03-2019T00:06:00,RimaDraws,it is looking great
22-03-2019T00:06:01,Aimbotexe,"Poor raine, it looks like she needs some serious R&R"
22-03-2019T00:06:02,MuonNeutrino,"like, how do you even walk when your legs are suddenly different lengths XD"
22-03-2019T00:06:03,AFallingTree,indeed they are
22-03-2019T00:06:03,Ordithus,Now if Red could be a gentleman for once and help her walk
22-03-2019T00:06:18,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Thats sythe job
22-03-2019T00:06:29,Ordithus,He's busy distracting Maren
22-03-2019T00:06:34,Aimbotexe,"Yeah Red heres your chance, don't F it up"
22-03-2019T00:06:38,MuonNeutrino,'distracting' >.>
22-03-2019T00:06:41,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Theres enough Sythe for both jobs
22-03-2019T00:06:46,MatyMaty,Maren x Sythe is the best new ship
22-03-2019T00:06:50,Supahbuzzer,"still lookin forward to her going full wolf again........... well, see you next week bros"
22-03-2019T00:06:57,Ordithus,Bye Supah

22-03-2019T00:07:30,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Liking the soft
22-03-2019T00:07:42,Mihari,If you did soft might as well keep it.
22-03-2019T00:07:49,ZRO4825,I like soft shading better myself~
22-03-2019T00:07:52,MuonNeutrino,"i wonder.... if raine and rose end up talking as the chapter title page suggests, i wonder if rose would have any advice for learning to control her transformations, given that rose was familiar with how euchre's transformations worked"
22-03-2019T00:08:09,Twokinds,Hmmm....
22-03-2019T00:08:16,SageSaga,Darker Toe beanies
22-03-2019T00:08:29,Masterzooka,#littlebeans

22-03-2019T00:08:57,Doebuns,Having Raine learn about her transformation would be kinda interesting
22-03-2019T00:09:09,Mihari,"Hrm, Maty, can you toggle off the linart?"
22-03-2019T00:09:15,MatyMaty,sure!
22-03-2019T00:09:16,Doebuns,and help controlling it too... Or plotting to take advantage of it >:3

22-03-2019T00:13:51,ZRO4825,I iz waiting on Maty's schedule for another pic myself. :3
22-03-2019T00:14:01,Mihari,My 'demand' is just a funny way for my slot.
22-03-2019T00:14:04,ZRO4825,Scorp...don't think Scorp does comms? o.o

22-03-2019T00:14:21,Nekonny,\o/
22-03-2019T00:14:26,ZRO4825,"Though comms from Scorp would be awesome, he has a wonderful style imo"
22-03-2019T00:14:26,Nekonny,itsss 1 am
22-03-2019T00:14:27,Mihari,No he doesn't. I would be paying for the extra details and just using my patreon
22-03-2019T00:14:33,ZRO4825,ahhh
22-03-2019T00:14:39,Nekonny,why am I not sleepy?
22-03-2019T00:14:48,ZRO4825,Too much caffeine in your system?
22-03-2019T00:14:56,Mihari,Cause you've been forcing a doggo to sneeze over and over.
22-03-2019T00:15:09,Ordithus,Have mercy
22-03-2019T00:15:09,Nekonny,XD
22-03-2019T00:15:21,ZRO4825,"Godai's good for quick comms, if you like his style, lol"
22-03-2019T00:15:26,Nekonny,I wish these didn't take so long
22-03-2019T00:15:30,Mihari,"Umm, no."
22-03-2019T00:15:32,Nekonny,I do have fun with them though
22-03-2019T00:15:47,Nekonny,and Ive built up a large library already
22-03-2019T00:16:13,ScorpDK,watching people painstakingly doing lineart gives me PTSD and phantom pains in my wrist :V
22-03-2019T00:16:33,Mihari,Try doing lines with my hands mister!
22-03-2019T00:16:37,Ordithus,Speaking of wrist pain... Sage?  How is yours?
22-03-2019T00:16:45,Mihari,No stabilizer is strong enough! XD
22-03-2019T00:16:56,MatyMaty,lineart alos sucks the life out of a sketch XP
22-03-2019T00:17:09,MarvTheHugPharaoh,to true
22-03-2019T00:17:11,ScorpDK,"I can't even guide my own hands, now imagine having to guide your hands with my hands, and NOT going to other places with 'em."
22-03-2019T00:17:15,ScorpDK,HARD
22-03-2019T00:17:16,ZRO4825,"I can't sketch to save my life. I kinda like doing linework off of other people's sketches though, lol"

22-03-2019T00:17:50,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I enjoy doing the lineart but it does for some reason change the feel of the piece
22-03-2019T00:18:05,NezumiYuki,"Ever thought about using PhotoShop pen-shapes, Mihari?   You could just lazily use a mouse and still scratch out some nice draws with some patience."
22-03-2019T00:18:10,SageSaga,it's very cute
22-03-2019T00:18:11,ZRO4825,I need all you artists that I am fond of to stop having health problems! >:(
22-03-2019T00:18:25,ScorpDK,lineart is like... having to redraw the entire image and then still editing the line so it isn't the same width everywhere...no thanks X_X
22-03-2019T00:18:38,Mihari,"You don't understand, nerve damage in extremities is the death of any artist XD"
22-03-2019T00:18:50,ScorpDK,"pretty much, yes."

22-03-2019T00:19:00,ZRO4825,"Yup, tis sadly true :c"
22-03-2019T00:19:01,SteelDragonFist,Not having health is not that possble
22-03-2019T00:19:02,NezumiYuki,"Pardon, I was unaware!  D:"

22-03-2019T00:20:37,Mihari,"Maty pushes everyone toward the lewd side, I Just get her to draw new shit."
22-03-2019T00:21:13,MrRetroRealm,Maty got me to be comfortable drawing lewd stuff and I thank her for it. She's the best :3
22-03-2019T00:21:14,Mihari,I figure if I can get her to do a proper Nyna my job is done.

22-03-2019T00:22:53,MarvTheHugPharaoh,How about cute and wholesome?
22-03-2019T00:22:54,ScorpDK,"That's like a Pillow fight, except one of them is biting/hugging it."

22-03-2019T00:24:52,ScorpDK,I draw cute lewds. All 18+ or equivalent.

22-03-2019T00:25:39,ZRO4825,Those two servers are known for very active RP communities. Saying there's server ORGIES would be pushing it a bit I believe.
22-03-2019T00:25:39,LannAF,I once saw a terrible piece of art someone commissioned of it
22-03-2019T00:25:47,SageSaga,i used to play on Ragnarok...

22-03-2019T00:35:10,MatyMaty,I was wondering it it was blending too much with the BG!
22-03-2019T00:35:16,Mihari,It's not.

22-03-2019T00:36:43,TheInkohaulyc,She's cute.
22-03-2019T00:36:54,NezumiYuki,Too cute!
22-03-2019T00:36:59,NezumiYuki,I think it's teh blue hair.....
22-03-2019T00:37:06,ScorpDK,Adventurer goes to an Inn for food. Sword and Board.
22-03-2019T00:37:06,MatyMaty,"Mmmm this mix of soft and cel looks good, but it clashes too much with the the BG I think"
22-03-2019T00:37:26,Mihari,"I don't it makes the BG seem like what it is, a background."
22-03-2019T00:37:37,ScorpDK,Hmm.
22-03-2019T00:37:51,Mihari,I think if you applied a general blur even it might work better.
22-03-2019T00:38:07,NezumiYuki,"Hmm good suggestion, Mihari"
22-03-2019T00:38:09,MatyMaty,okay!
22-03-2019T00:38:26,Mihari,"Won't know until you try, blurs are tricky."
22-03-2019T00:38:38,MatyMaty,waits for the lag to catch up
22-03-2019T00:38:40,SageSaga,gotta be a depth of field blur
22-03-2019T00:38:59,ScorpDK,"Once you're done, yeah. Make a flattened copy of the whole thing, blur it by 6pt, lower opacity to 15 or less. Make another, blur by...a lot (32-64), reduce opacity to 15-25%, set to overlay, see how it looks XD"
22-03-2019T00:39:13,Mihari,^
22-03-2019T00:39:13,Crawford,it seems to make the character pop . for me at least and i agree the blur will help make the charcter pop more.
22-03-2019T00:39:29,MatyMaty,okay lets see!
22-03-2019T00:39:36,ScorpDK,helps the character and BG to blend together a bit more. I tend to use that whenever I have a full-color image.
22-03-2019T00:39:40,MatyMaty,*copypastes the instructions into a text file*
22-03-2019T00:39:44,ScorpDK,Tho that's always the last step XD
22-03-2019T00:39:46,ScorpDK,lol

22-03-2019T00:39:58,SteelDragonFist,I'm gonna get going.
22-03-2019T00:40:04,Crawford,later steel
22-03-2019T00:40:08,SteelDragonFist,Thanks for the streams.
22-03-2019T00:40:08,TheInkohaulyc,Why lousy?
22-03-2019T00:40:21,ScorpDK,Intensively.
22-03-2019T00:40:22,Mihari,Because sometimes life sucks.
22-03-2019T00:40:28,SteelDragonFist,I'lll tune next time.
22-03-2019T00:40:40,ScorpDK,"hmmm... emote didn't go through, oh well."
22-03-2019T00:40:56,Mihari,"I'd rather not be emo on the stream so, so lets just pretend I said fine and move on? Kay? :3"
22-03-2019T00:41:02,ScorpDK,Picarto disapproved of me petting the cheetah.
22-03-2019T00:41:06,Peachyu,eyy ty for having me~
22-03-2019T00:41:13,TheInkohaulyc,"No problem, Mihari."
22-03-2019T00:41:23,Mihari,I appreciate the asking and all that.
22-03-2019T00:41:25,unsteddyphoenix,Rip :/
22-03-2019T00:41:39,ScorpDK,Emo-Mihari wouldn't work. Black hair and dark makeup just isn't your style :V
22-03-2019T00:41:40,Crawford,tomorrow's a new day mihari
22-03-2019T00:41:51,MatyMaty,there we go
22-03-2019T00:41:52,Crawford,lol scorp
22-03-2019T00:41:53,Mihari,We've already proved Mihari looks awesome with black hair.
22-03-2019T00:41:55,TheInkohaulyc,"Would still cuddle, though."
22-03-2019T00:41:59,Mihari,and fur completely dyed black
22-03-2019T00:42:05,ScorpDK,:P
22-03-2019T00:42:11,Bgrmystr2,Emo Mihari... Emohari?
22-03-2019T00:42:17,Mihari,Don't push it.
22-03-2019T00:42:17,ScorpDK,Black Cathari
22-03-2019T00:42:17,Crawford,black fur with silver spots
22-03-2019T00:42:18,unsteddyphoenix,Where have we proved this? proof?
22-03-2019T00:42:21,Artistafrustrado,Gothari!
22-03-2019T00:42:21,unsteddyphoenix,gothari
22-03-2019T00:42:24,unsteddyphoenix,Ayyy
22-03-2019T00:42:28,Artistafrustrado,eyy!!
22-03-2019T00:42:28,NezumiYuki,I could still see Mihair wearing a black teddy with fishnets however.  XD
22-03-2019T00:42:29,TheInkohaulyc,Black Kilrathi?
22-03-2019T00:42:42,SageSaga,in another universe Mihari looks exactly the same as she does now- but has Purple hair
22-03-2019T00:42:44,ScorpDK,Now I imagine Mihari in Black Cat's outfit. Noice.
22-03-2019T00:42:54,MatyMaty,"pink hair, sage"
22-03-2019T00:42:57,MatyMaty,runs
22-03-2019T00:42:59,ScorpDK,ooof.
22-03-2019T00:43:21,TheInkohaulyc,Intriguing idea. Too bad a ratty already tried it. >:3
22-03-2019T00:43:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,PINK!!!! \o/
22-03-2019T00:43:33,Mihari,Sadly I don't have a SFW version the attempt XD
22-03-2019T00:43:40,MrRetroRealm,So who's the lady Maty been drawin?
22-03-2019T00:43:54,TheInkohaulyc,A...kitty?
22-03-2019T00:43:55,Crawford,sfw is overrated
22-03-2019T00:44:04,NezumiYuki,What is SFW?!
22-03-2019T00:44:07,Mihari,SFW is the rules of this stream however.
22-03-2019T00:44:17,BadFoMo,Safe For Work.
22-03-2019T00:44:18,MatyMaty,"mmm this actually looks pretty neat, Scorp"
22-03-2019T00:44:26,ScorpDK,"I know, right?"
22-03-2019T00:44:30,MatyMaty,you can't censor it? :O
22-03-2019T00:44:38,Mihari,Oh he show you it?
22-03-2019T00:44:43,NezumiYuki,"I'm kidding of course.  I knew the deff of SFW, I was simply acting like a goof!  xD"
22-03-2019T00:44:44,Crawford,"rules of the land, when in rome do as the romans do"
22-03-2019T00:44:51,BadFoMo,Oh...
22-03-2019T00:45:15,ScorpDK,"oh, no. We're talking about the layer effect."
22-03-2019T00:45:25,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"When in Rome, Bang caligula"
22-03-2019T00:45:32,Mihari,Ah
22-03-2019T00:45:33,ScorpDK,I haven't accessed my giant pile of art XD
22-03-2019T00:45:43,Mihari,I linked her.
22-03-2019T00:45:51,ScorpDK,oh.
22-03-2019T00:45:53,ScorpDK,XD
22-03-2019T00:45:55,Crawford,only if he pays fir the tab  marv
22-03-2019T00:46:07,ScorpDK,I wouldn't be able to find that image on demand in under 30 minutes.
22-03-2019T00:46:14,MatyMaty,Now I'm gonna imagine dragon Jake sleeping on top of a mountain of Mihari arts
22-03-2019T00:46:20,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Wasn't he the Emperor of Rome
22-03-2019T00:46:23,Mazinja,pfehe
22-03-2019T00:46:30,ScorpDK,:P
22-03-2019T00:46:37,ScorpDK,MAH HOARD!
22-03-2019T00:46:40,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Jake long the American dragon?
22-03-2019T00:46:41,Mihari,Wouldn't it be dragon mihari sleeping on a mount of arts?
22-03-2019T00:46:48,Crawford,"yah, decandant as all get out"
22-03-2019T00:46:54,Mihari,Since I'm the one collecting? XD
22-03-2019T00:46:56,MatyMaty,that too XD
22-03-2019T00:46:58,Crawford,dragon mihari.....sounds cool
22-03-2019T00:47:02,ZRO4825,"We need a picture of that now, lol"
22-03-2019T00:47:02,TheInkohaulyc,I should try that. Mihari as a dragon could prove interesting.
22-03-2019T00:47:06,ScorpDK,"Probably, but I dunno if you'd look as sexy as a dragon :v"
22-03-2019T00:47:08,MatyMaty,that would actually be a really fun pivc
22-03-2019T00:47:14,MatyMaty,pic*
22-03-2019T00:47:14,SageSaga,problem is you have to eat it all before you die
22-03-2019T00:47:22,NezumiYuki,"What color of dragun would you be, Mihari?  :D"
22-03-2019T00:47:27,Mihari,gold
22-03-2019T00:47:28,ScorpDK,"""Feed me...more...art!"""
22-03-2019T00:47:29,Nekonny,paper burns tho
22-03-2019T00:47:30,NezumiYuki,Neat!
22-03-2019T00:47:32,MatyMaty,gold with spots
22-03-2019T00:47:34,NezumiYuki,Gold works!
22-03-2019T00:47:36,TheInkohaulyc,Dur.
22-03-2019T00:47:39,Crawford,if any one could do it it would be maty or scorp to pull it off
22-03-2019T00:47:59,TheInkohaulyc,"Did I make you a dragon, Zumi?"
22-03-2019T00:48:13,MatyMaty,well I think she done
22-03-2019T00:48:25,TheInkohaulyc,I don't see a fork.
22-03-2019T00:48:25,SageSaga,dragons eat their treasure before they die so they can take it with them
22-03-2019T00:48:30,unsteddyphoenix,:ok_hand::ok_hand::ok_hand::ok_hand::ok_hand::ok_hand::ok_hand:
22-03-2019T00:48:31,MarvTheHugPharaoh,She's adorable Maty
22-03-2019T00:48:33,Ordithus,:ptv-excited: nice
22-03-2019T00:48:40,NezumiYuki,"I can't recall, Inky.  D:   I can't even recall if I ever finished off my own doodle of Dragon Yuki......"
22-03-2019T00:48:46,Mihari,Well that's what prestig is for Sage
22-03-2019T00:48:50,MatyMaty,I only need to NSFW-fy her later ;v
22-03-2019T00:49:05,TheInkohaulyc,Would be neat.
22-03-2019T00:49:18,TheInkohaulyc,"She is a kitty, right?"
22-03-2019T00:49:31,MatyMaty,a faeles
22-03-2019T00:49:33,MrRetroRealm,The shading and lighting looks great
22-03-2019T00:49:35,MatyMaty,"I mean, lynx :P"
22-03-2019T00:49:39,MrRetroRealm,lol
22-03-2019T00:49:51,Mihari,Nice slip
22-03-2019T00:49:55,MrRetroRealm,"You mentioned Scorp's OC race, didnt ya"
22-03-2019T00:49:59,ScorpDK,So if you find a poet dragon... you can literally make him eat his words :L
22-03-2019T00:50:12,Crawford,ha
22-03-2019T00:50:17,NezumiYuki,"Thing is, my proficiency with drawing, and my art styling has changed over time.  I'm not even sure I'd be able to redraw my lame attempt at a dragon again.   It'd probably be better if I just drew a whole new dragon Yuki."
22-03-2019T00:50:29,MatyMaty,"funny thing is, I made this drawing at 4000 pixels wide"
22-03-2019T00:50:34,SageSaga,I think thats Copper Dragons Scorp
22-03-2019T00:50:35,MatyMaty,instead of the usual 8000
22-03-2019T00:50:40,MatyMaty,and it was finee
22-03-2019T00:50:45,SageSaga,they treasure music and artwork and written works
22-03-2019T00:50:45,Mihari,I know I couldn't draw a dragon again XD
22-03-2019T00:50:49,ScorpDK,I'm not particularly good with dragons. It would probably be a sharp-toothed horse with horns :V
22-03-2019T00:50:50,ScorpDK,XD
22-03-2019T00:50:53,MatyMaty,maybe I don't need to make hueg files :P
22-03-2019T00:51:08,TheInkohaulyc,Then it shall be up to me! Hahah!
22-03-2019T00:51:17,ScorpDK,It all depends on what you're comfortable with.
22-03-2019T00:51:31,ScorpDK,"AND REALLY. If you're gonna lineart it anyway, probably not needed to make it huge :V"
22-03-2019T00:51:39,ZaCloud,"Hey umm, just so you know MatyMaty, this stream came up despite browsing in Safe Mode. Could you please flag your stream as NSFW if you're gonna have girlcrotch in viewers' faces? ;P"
22-03-2019T00:51:40,ScorpDK,Das a cute!
22-03-2019T00:51:49,ScorpDK,Cute lion girl.
22-03-2019T00:52:03,NezumiYuki,"I'd say it depends on subject matter entirely, Maty.   Some images are much MUCH easier to work on in a very large canvas.  Others not so much, and you could get by with a smaller file."
22-03-2019T00:52:08,TheInkohaulyc,My notice showed it was NSFW.
22-03-2019T00:52:20,MatyMaty,what is NSFW?
22-03-2019T00:52:30,ZaCloud,"Hmm, wonder if it's a bug from being part of a multistream then..."
22-03-2019T00:52:37,Mihari,Maty's very presence!
22-03-2019T00:52:38,ScorpDK,Baby don't lewd me. Don't lewd me. No more.
22-03-2019T00:52:40,ZaCloud,"Not Safe For Work (in other words, containing sexual material)"
22-03-2019T00:52:43,BadFoMo,Not Safe For Work.
22-03-2019T00:52:52,TheInkohaulyc,"Nostalgia, Science Fiction, Wardrobe."
22-03-2019T00:52:55,Bgrmystr2,this stream isn't NSFW though
22-03-2019T00:52:56,NezumiYuki,^
22-03-2019T00:52:59,MatyMaty,I know that :P
22-03-2019T00:53:00,Bgrmystr2,it's all SFW
22-03-2019T00:53:01,Mazinja,I'm pretty sure Maty knows >_>
22-03-2019T00:53:01,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Peachyus stream might be nsfw
22-03-2019T00:53:05,MatyMaty,I mean what is set to NSFW
22-03-2019T00:53:09,Crawford,according to tumblr if it shows anything that can be consodered lewd....even a picture of sand
22-03-2019T00:53:11,Bgrmystr2,"it's not, Marv"
22-03-2019T00:53:11,MatyMaty,my stream isn't
22-03-2019T00:53:18,SageSaga,everyone here is set to SFW
22-03-2019T00:53:20,Bgrmystr2,I'm lookin at it
22-03-2019T00:53:22,NezumiYuki,Oh trust me... Maty knows what NSFW is..... as do I.   xDDD
22-03-2019T00:53:24,SageSaga,we are all on the main page too
22-03-2019T00:53:28,Mihari,I'm set to apple pie
22-03-2019T00:53:39,NezumiYuki,Mmmm pie!
22-03-2019T00:53:42,SageSaga,omg hun i miss apple pie
22-03-2019T00:53:43,Crawford,with cheese ?
22-03-2019T00:53:46,MarvTheHugPharaoh,if you look close at Peachs sketch it got bits
22-03-2019T00:53:48,ZaCloud,"Well yours is showing as the top video, and had an anthro girl showing her crotch suggestively even if it wasn't detailed. :P"
22-03-2019T00:53:55,ZaCloud,Just not a thing kids should see.
22-03-2019T00:53:56,MatyMaty,I've never had apple pie :o
22-03-2019T00:53:57,ScorpDK,*hums the American Pie theme*
22-03-2019T00:54:01,Mazinja,I'm set to Sekiro Ass Kicking
22-03-2019T00:54:14,MatyMaty,Only apple... strudel? that german thingie.
22-03-2019T00:54:21,SageSaga,Maty- you can easily make an apple pie
22-03-2019T00:54:21,Crawford,altho i did make pumpkin pie today
22-03-2019T00:54:22,Mihari,Apple pie is very roundabout way of saying nsfw XD
22-03-2019T00:54:29,MatyMaty,oh XD
22-03-2019T00:54:36,Crawford,^
22-03-2019T00:54:37,NezumiYuki,OMG apple strudel!!!   Love those!
22-03-2019T00:54:37,Mihari,old throw back
22-03-2019T00:54:39,ScorpDK,roundabout and hot in the center.
22-03-2019T00:54:42,SageSaga,im talking about apple pie not NSFW
22-03-2019T00:54:43,TheInkohaulyc,Could also mean Mihari is delicious.
22-03-2019T00:55:02,MatyMaty,Do not eat Mihari please
22-03-2019T00:55:13,NezumiYuki,Mihari IS delicious!   Just ask that blue haired gazelle boi?!
22-03-2019T00:55:16,Mihari,Any response I have to that is clearly NSFW
22-03-2019T00:55:32,TheInkohaulyc,"Oh, I would eat her...OUT. Ahem!"
22-03-2019T00:55:33,ScorpDK,*bites lip*
22-03-2019T00:55:50,TheInkohaulyc,Oh.
22-03-2019T00:55:55,Bgrmystr2,"ZaCloud, there was nothing NSFW on Maty's stream. Suggestive maybe, but not 18+"
22-03-2019T00:56:17,BadFoMo,Picarto durped on me. What did I miss?
22-03-2019T00:56:21,Ordithus,NSFW is a funny thing
22-03-2019T00:56:29,Bgrmystr2,"Everything, Fomo"
22-03-2019T00:56:41,TheInkohaulyc,Pun was bad.
22-03-2019T00:56:42,ZaCloud,I'm looking at it right now. There's at least two of a chick displaying her crotch in an adult way that kids shouldn't think is ok to imitate. And that some peeps just don't want to see.
22-03-2019T00:56:58,Ordithus,"Like, none of these are ""NSFW"" as we say, but I wouldn't watch this at work :D"
22-03-2019T00:57:02,Bgrmystr2,thennnnnn don't look at it?
22-03-2019T00:57:08,Artistafrustrado,dat Warrior cutie <3
22-03-2019T00:57:24,ZaCloud,"I wouldn't be looking at it if it didn't pop up despite me browsing in safe mode, now would I?"
22-03-2019T00:57:25,Mihari,Sadly the line for adult or not is really blurred to most online these days.
22-03-2019T00:57:43,Crawford,^
22-03-2019T00:57:44,Stootza,howdy
22-03-2019T00:57:48,Crawford,sup
22-03-2019T00:57:51,ScorpDK,In other news: It's art. Kids have less issues with it than prudes who think they need to speak for everyone else.
22-03-2019T00:57:52,BadFoMo,"Also, Picarto! Y U No let Peachyu's stream work?!"
22-03-2019T00:57:52,MatyMaty,Het Stootz
22-03-2019T00:57:55,NezumiYuki,Hi Stoot
22-03-2019T00:58:00,ZaCloud,"Just basically if you'd be uncomfortable with your 8 year old daughter doing whatever's in the picture, then consider it NSFW and flag it thusly."
22-03-2019T00:58:08,BadFoMo,...It's working now.
22-03-2019T00:58:14,Mihari,"But that being said, if a kid was looking for adult material I garantee you they've found pornhub already."
22-03-2019T00:58:24,NezumiYuki,^
22-03-2019T00:58:26,Crawford,^
22-03-2019T00:58:37,Bgrmystr2,"If you're worried about what's going on here of all places on the internet, you have much more pressing matters to worry about, just sayin"
22-03-2019T00:58:46,ScorpDK,"That, and usually 8-year olds don't go to Picarto, they watch drawing videos on Youtube."
22-03-2019T00:58:47,NezumiYuki,^
22-03-2019T00:58:48,Mihari,"That being said, I'm not disagreeing with you."
22-03-2019T00:59:14,ZaCloud,"Look, the flagging system is there for a reason. All I'm saying is use it, it's one little click and doesn't hurt you, while helping everyone else. What's there to argue about?"
22-03-2019T00:59:23,Mihari,"A crotch, bit visable or otherwise is probably not what a kid should see. However, still by the flat out rules specified on this site, it's not NSFW so discussing it further is pointless."
22-03-2019T00:59:41,Bgrmystr2,What mihari said.
22-03-2019T00:59:48,ScorpDK,"I have marked essentially every piece of art as mature these days, just to not have to worry with FA mods randomly coming at me saying ""Yo, dude. These tits are 4 cups too large, we can't have kids see this""."
22-03-2019T00:59:51,NezumiYuki,"Welp, I must say, that is a very cute bear girl Maty!"
22-03-2019T00:59:53,TheInkohaulyc,No pictures of trees. Got it.
22-03-2019T01:00:08,Crawford,these guys are mods for a reason they know their stuff
22-03-2019T01:00:13,MatyMaty,"ZaCloud, when a site admin comes tell me that, I will set my stream to NSFW.  That's it. I am not drawing anything that by the site's own rules needs to be marked as NSFW"
22-03-2019T01:00:28,ScorpDK,FA Mods? No. They do not.
22-03-2019T01:00:28,ZaCloud,Why?
22-03-2019T01:00:30,ScorpDK,XD
22-03-2019T01:00:36,Mihari,"If it REALLY bothers you, feel free to report it, the site staff will decide and make a call."
22-03-2019T01:00:41,ZaCloud,It literally wouldn't hurt you.
22-03-2019T01:00:43,MatyMaty,yup
22-03-2019T01:00:44,MrRetroRealm,Who dat @MatyMaty?
22-03-2019T01:00:58,ScorpDK,A beary cute girl.
22-03-2019T01:01:03,NezumiYuki,Maty be Maty
22-03-2019T01:01:10,Crawford,its beary good
22-03-2019T01:01:13,Stootza,"I mean, she's showing lots of skin, I approve, but yea, by definition not nsfw"
22-03-2019T01:01:15,ZaCloud,"It would only help people who don't want to see it while not bothering you at all, so why put up a big old fight about it? You really want kids to see this stuff that much? :/"
22-03-2019T01:01:29,ZRO4825,"Given what I've heard ""parents"" these days blasting in their music with their kids around, I figure tits and vag are the least of their damned worries."
22-03-2019T01:01:31,Bgrmystr2,You're the only one making a big deal about it. :)
22-03-2019T01:01:33,Azuro25,"@MatyMaty heya miss martha, working on more chars today? :)"
22-03-2019T01:01:37,Mihari,"As a parent myself, I just flat out block this site from my kids."
22-03-2019T01:01:42,Stootza,"regardless, looking good here, Maty"
22-03-2019T01:01:44,Mihari,So...
22-03-2019T01:01:53,ZaCloud,"Only making a deal about it because they didn't go ""ok"" and click the button."
22-03-2019T01:01:54,ScorpDK,Better safe than sorry.
22-03-2019T01:02:03,ScorpDK,"""Do as I say OR ELSE!"""
22-03-2019T01:02:09,ZRO4825,"Mihari, you're also a damned bit more tech minded than like, 75% of parents out there. :P"
22-03-2019T01:02:17,ScorpDK,THat's not clicking with people in 2019.
22-03-2019T01:02:29,ScorpDK,Parents :P
22-03-2019T01:02:35,Crawford,"logic long jumps, huh"
22-03-2019T01:02:36,Mihari,Most routers these days it's as much as putting a domain in the block list now.
22-03-2019T01:02:39,Ordithus,Picarto also isn't some really well known site that some kid is going to stumble on unless they already know an artist
22-03-2019T01:02:42,ZaCloud,"Seriously, you have a problem if you fight tooth and nail against the idea of keeping softcore porn away from kids. That's messed up if you stop and think about it."
22-03-2019T01:02:59,TheInkohaulyc,"Back in my day, we had these things called floppy discs. They were all the rage."
22-03-2019T01:03:01,ScorpDK,"Most parents these days type ""www.facebook.com"" into the Google search field."
22-03-2019T01:03:06,MatyMaty,"I think *you* are getting a little out of boundaries, ZaCloud"
22-03-2019T01:03:28,ZaCloud,By wanting to keep softcore porn away from kids?
22-03-2019T01:03:41,ZaCloud,And people who marked that they don't want to see it?
22-03-2019T01:03:43,ZRO4825,By coming in here and deciding you need to preach.
22-03-2019T01:03:52,ScorpDK,If you don't want to see it. LEAVE. XD
22-03-2019T01:03:53,ZaCloud,I wouldn't if you marked mature content as mature.
22-03-2019T01:03:58,ZRO4825,"Seriously. You got a problem with what does or doesn't get marked, report it to the admins."
22-03-2019T01:04:11,MatyMaty,"okay, exactly what I have on screen right now that is mature?"
22-03-2019T01:04:12,ZaCloud,The problem was me seeing it in the first place when the marking is there for that very reason.
22-03-2019T01:04:23,ScorpDK,"""I don't want to see this, therefore I shall dive headfirst in and scream at everyone as I stare at the art I don't want to see""."
22-03-2019T01:04:29,ZRO4825,"In the meantime, consider that you've got softcore porn essentially sitting on billboards these days, along with violence and drugs in our music."
22-03-2019T01:04:30,Crawford,well you see it on tv nowadays
22-03-2019T01:04:31,Ordithus,https://picarto.tv/site/terms Item 14 ZaCloud
22-03-2019T01:04:34,Bgrmystr2,"gonna agree w/ Maty. If you have a problem with the guidelines that the website has, then go email picarto support."
22-03-2019T01:04:44,Bgrmystr2,Don't come to us
22-03-2019T01:05:03,ScorpDK,"I feel like I should start my stream, disable the NSFW tag, and start drawing really voluptous girls in compromising positions but 100% decently clothed."
22-03-2019T01:05:10,Crawford,^
22-03-2019T01:05:23,TheInkohaulyc,Victorian style?
22-03-2019T01:05:23,ZaCloud,I just figured I'd have the courtesy to let you know so you could fix it yourself. I gave you credit that you'd maturely click the flag because you care about other people.
22-03-2019T01:05:32,ZaCloud,Clearly I was too optimistic.
22-03-2019T01:05:39,ZRO4825,That's projecting. And also flat out accusation.
22-03-2019T01:05:45,ScorpDK,"No, just very holier-than-thou."
22-03-2019T01:05:45,NezumiYuki,"Yes Inky, Victorian, complete with bustles and pantaloons!"
22-03-2019T01:05:47,ZRO4825,"As of this point, I say to you, sir or madam, shove off."
22-03-2019T01:06:30,Crawford,anyways arts looking good
22-03-2019T01:06:35,TheInkohaulyc,He got the claws.
22-03-2019T01:06:40,ScorpDK,Whoooooo can say where the road gooooess...
22-03-2019T01:06:48,Mihari,Anyway
22-03-2019T01:06:49,NezumiYuki,"Yes yes, back to the arts!    And looking good there Maty!"
22-03-2019T01:06:57,ScorpDK,Maty sent him to the bottom of the sea.
22-03-2019T01:06:59,Deciem,Hello

22-03-2019T01:07:18,Deciem,How is everyone tonight?
22-03-2019T01:07:24,Sogen,"So aside from that bit of unpleasantness, how's everybody doing tonight?"
22-03-2019T01:07:25,ScorpDK,:P
22-03-2019T01:07:29,Deciem,Did I come in at a bad time?
22-03-2019T01:07:30,NezumiYuki,"Pretty good here, how bout you, Dec?"
22-03-2019T01:07:30,TheInkohaulyc,Mihari sent him away.
22-03-2019T01:07:42,ScorpDK,:cscorpdk-woah::thumbsup: All's well
22-03-2019T01:07:43,Bgrmystr2,and peace has once again come to the stream chat.
22-03-2019T01:07:47,Deciem,I'm okay
22-03-2019T01:07:47,BadFoMo,I'm fine. You.
22-03-2019T01:07:48,Sogen,Beat me to it Deciem

22-03-2019T01:08:02,Deciem,Hey Mihari... how are things
22-03-2019T01:08:05,Mihari,"Things are fine, just had to take a soapbox away."
22-03-2019T01:08:07,NezumiYuki,"Say Mihari, did you use a little Framing Ban Hammer on him, or a 2kg sledge?  xDDDDD"
22-03-2019T01:08:30,TheInkohaulyc,16 ton weight.
22-03-2019T01:08:32,Deciem,"I hadn't seen you in a while, and your last FA journal made me worried"

22-03-2019T01:09:18,TheInkohaulyc,I want that gun.
22-03-2019T01:09:19,NezumiYuki,"Fekking perfect answer, Mihari!  xDDDD"

22-03-2019T01:09:43,Mihari,Leaves no trace.

22-03-2019T01:09:59,TheInkohaulyc,And the fresh scent of lemons.
22-03-2019T01:10:01,ZRO4825,Pool noodle~
22-03-2019T01:10:19,Mihari,I need to find someone who is good at metal colouring.
22-03-2019T01:10:36,TheInkohaulyc,You can color with metal?
22-03-2019T01:10:40,NezumiYuki,Now I can't get the image of Mihari the Orbital Bombardment Cannon out of my head.... thnx Mihair!   xDDD
22-03-2019T01:10:45,Deciem,painting metal texture?
22-03-2019T01:10:46,Mihari,Replicating the look of metal.
22-03-2019T01:10:51,ScorpDK,Vector Cannon.
22-03-2019T01:10:52,Crawford,you can anodize metal
22-03-2019T01:10:55,Mazinja,OK that's enough getting my ass kicked x_x
22-03-2019T01:10:58,SageSaga,only thing i want to say about the whole mess earlier is- when it comes to drawing artwork its very common to draw the characters totally nude before doing outfits- this is vital to making things look right- so every stream where a person is drawing
22-03-2019T01:11:08,SageSaga,"characters will have some ""nudity"""
22-03-2019T01:11:17,ZRO4825,Yarpz.
22-03-2019T01:11:17,ScorpDK,"Mechahari anchoring her feet to the ground before unleashing the biggest ""F.U."" to the foe."
22-03-2019T01:11:20,Deciem,Did I miss a big argument?
22-03-2019T01:11:30,Mazinja,complaining mostly
22-03-2019T01:11:34,ScorpDK,the WIP nudity.
22-03-2019T01:11:35,MrRetroRealm,"Speaking of drawing, I actually been doing so for a few hours now XP"
22-03-2019T01:11:41,ZRO4825,"You missed someone trying to preach at us for not marking ourselves as ""mature"" for ""softcore porn"""
22-03-2019T01:11:44,Crawford,nothing worth as  recap
22-03-2019T01:11:45,ScorpDK,"AKA ""lol, she is naked, what?"""
22-03-2019T01:11:49,NezumiYuki,"Agreed Sage, it's how I've been mastering my doodles too.   It's part of the process, why have a hang up over it?"
22-03-2019T01:12:05,ZRO4825,"Because some people be prudes, and think their kids have to be too."
22-03-2019T01:12:05,Mihari,"Soapboxer about exposed genitalia on the frontpage not being marked as NSFW even tho it was ""bit less"" and thus according to Picarto's rules, fine."
22-03-2019T01:12:23,Peachyu,uhhh
22-03-2019T01:12:34,BadFoMo,Hmm?
22-03-2019T01:12:34,Peachyu,is it about my sketch or...w
22-03-2019T01:12:36,Peachyu,?
22-03-2019T01:12:38,Mihari,No
22-03-2019T01:12:39,MatyMaty,"I wonder what that person would have said about the latest A.I page, Sage :P"
22-03-2019T01:12:40,Crawford,no rest for the triggered i guess
22-03-2019T01:12:49,Deciem,"well, there are degrees of taste regarding exposed skin"
22-03-2019T01:12:51,SageSaga,I did set the stream to NSFW for that page
22-03-2019T01:12:51,Mihari,"You're peachy, Peachyu"
22-03-2019T01:12:56,ZRO4825,"Amen to that, Crawford, lol"
22-03-2019T01:13:01,ScorpDK,"""THINK ABOUT THE CHILDREN!"" I don't need to, son. I see you, I hear you. No need to THINK about you :V"
22-03-2019T01:13:15,NezumiYuki,LOL Scorp!
22-03-2019T01:13:22,Mihari,I could argue that the stream should be set to NSFW whenever Kaylin is being drawn.
22-03-2019T01:13:25,TheInkohaulyc,"Those are bewbs, not what he was complaing about. Completely different."
22-03-2019T01:13:30,Ordithus,haha
22-03-2019T01:13:35,Sogen,:D
22-03-2019T01:13:40,Bgrmystr2,"Personally, I'll let the children think for themselves, thanks.. instead of having other people think for them. That's just rude."
22-03-2019T01:13:45,SageSaga,Is Kaylin more NSFW than Nyna?
22-03-2019T01:13:46,Deciem,I know there were a lot of issues regarding NSFW content and minors joining rooms in the early days of picarto
22-03-2019T01:13:48,MatyMaty,"funnily so, that person has a ton of FF slash on their galleries, including clearly underage Cloud with grown up Zack"
22-03-2019T01:13:49,Mihari,VERY
22-03-2019T01:13:58,ZRO4825,"*Sage's stream gets set to NSFW*  ""WTH...Oh, it's a ZRO request again....damnit ZRO."""
22-03-2019T01:14:02,NezumiYuki,Oh gods.... Boobs.... specifically boos size...   That's a whole other can of worms....
22-03-2019T01:14:05,Peachyu,did u call me mihari?
22-03-2019T01:14:08,Crawford,well i mean how much of the stuff that they were complaining about is shown on day time tv ?
22-03-2019T01:14:15,Mihari,"I answered your question, hehe."
22-03-2019T01:14:17,Deciem,"but as long as you set the channel to no guests and mature mode, there shouldn't be a problem"
22-03-2019T01:14:17,MatyMaty,but I guess is just softcore porn if the subject is female :P
22-03-2019T01:14:34,Mihari,From my view point as long as no bits are showing she might as well be wearing a bikini
22-03-2019T01:14:37,ZRO4825,"Damned womens, being all sexy and stuff and making people think up sexy things and stuff!"
22-03-2019T01:14:47,NezumiYuki,^
22-03-2019T01:14:48,NezumiYuki,XD
22-03-2019T01:14:52,Peachyu,oh ok
22-03-2019T01:14:53,ScorpDK,"Wanna know what's really fun? You mark your stream as NSFW. What happens? A 12 year old joins the stream, because he faked his birthday and disabled the NSFW filter, because they're NOT. AS. DUMB. AS. THEIR. PARENTS. :V"
22-03-2019T01:15:01,Peachyu,sry im just super lost here
22-03-2019T01:15:09,Mihari,Probably for the best :P
22-03-2019T01:15:09,Peachyu,i like how active this chat is tho
22-03-2019T01:15:18,Mihari,Just keep drawing the cute stuff! :D
22-03-2019T01:15:27,Ordithus,Arts!
22-03-2019T01:15:28,NezumiYuki,"No worries Peachyu, welcome aboard!"
22-03-2019T01:15:31,Crawford,remember the adult sites that used to say are you over 18  to enter ?
22-03-2019T01:15:31,Mihari,You almost balance out Matty
22-03-2019T01:15:33,ZRO4825,"No one actually was doing anything wrong, is the real point of it, Peachyu. Just someone wanted to whine. :P"
22-03-2019T01:15:35,Mihari,Maty*
22-03-2019T01:15:43,ZRO4825,LOL Mihari :joy:
22-03-2019T01:15:56,Crawford,so i doubt those kept many underaged out
22-03-2019T01:16:07,Ordithus,"With how pushy they were, I suspect more troll-y than honest"
22-03-2019T01:16:15,Sogen,Heaven forfend they should show so much as an ankle. What is this 1850?
22-03-2019T01:16:17,MatyMaty,XD
22-03-2019T01:16:26,SageSaga,nah that person wasnt trolling
22-03-2019T01:16:27,Deciem,"if I may be honest, it's all just lines on a screen. the content might be graphic, but there isn't anything *that* objectionable on screen at the moment"
22-03-2019T01:16:29,Mihari,"Umm, but yah, I believe whole heartedly it's a parents responsibility to restrict their kids from stuff, if they don't know how, there places that can help with that."
22-03-2019T01:16:31,Peachyu,ok >:3c imma just keep dping whatever im doing hehe
22-03-2019T01:16:32,NezumiYuki,"Troll is exactly what I was thinking, Ord!"

22-03-2019T01:16:36,Crawford,what she showed an ankle scandaless
22-03-2019T01:16:39,ZRO4825,"Yeah, kids ain't dumb. Hell, I made it past school-locks back when the internet was still fairly fresh to schools 20 years ago. If I did it then, you can damned well bet kids these days are making it past simple lockouts like that."

22-03-2019T01:29:40,Sogen,Ah the days of downloading AMVs because YouTube didn't exist yet
22-03-2019T01:30:08,Deciem,I thought it was revived by a different group (not llamasoft)
22-03-2019T01:31:36,Deciem,"er, nullsoft"
22-03-2019T01:31:42,Mihari,"Hard to say, but it's on winamp.com, all I know."

22-03-2019T01:32:04,ScorpDK,"you know a mediaplayer is good, when it doesn't take up 100MB+ harddrive space. :v"
22-03-2019T01:32:14,Crawford,just the game itself
22-03-2019T01:32:21,NezumiYuki,Games came in six packs of 3.5inch floppies

22-03-2019T01:33:13,Mihari,I remember where there wasn't DLC just expansions and map packs
22-03-2019T01:33:30,Deciem,I remember installing photoshop with 14 floppies
22-03-2019T01:33:31,8EyedBoo,"Ah yes, one of the many reasons one tended not to have/play extensive game libraries"
22-03-2019T01:33:31,Crawford,or the games came on cd and needed the key to work no online crap
22-03-2019T01:33:35,Peachyu,<3
22-03-2019T01:33:55,Crawford,no micro transactions
22-03-2019T01:33:56,NezumiYuki,Games were on physical disks... you could actually KEEP and use offline... yeah

22-03-2019T01:34:07,NezumiYuki,OMG XD
22-03-2019T01:34:09,Deciem,"the maps were free, but you had to figure out how to install them"
22-03-2019T01:34:12,Sogen,Yes! And even the expansions were extensive enough to be a self-contained game
22-03-2019T01:34:21,Mihari,It's a stupid number floppies
22-03-2019T01:34:30,Ordithus,How many?
22-03-2019T01:34:31,ScorpDK,"not quite 95, but may as well"
22-03-2019T01:34:33,Deciem,I'll bet

22-03-2019T01:36:38,Mihari,I'm pretty sure these disks wouldn't work
22-03-2019T01:36:46,Mihari,They've probably been demagnatized
22-03-2019T01:36:47,Crawford,the getting stuck in the drives due to the sliding tabs
22-03-2019T01:37:06,Mihari,They are only good for 10 years or so I think?
22-03-2019T01:37:12,NezumiYuki,Push the eject button and NOTHING HAPPENS..... FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
22-03-2019T01:37:13,Deciem,"I do miss owning a nice album, though. with packaging and liner notes"

22-03-2019T01:41:51,NezumiYuki,I can't even rememeber what my first CD album was....
22-03-2019T01:41:56,Mihari,I could of sworn ABBA was first.
22-03-2019T01:42:04,Crawford,all that you can't leave behind was the album.
22-03-2019T01:42:25,Deciem,My first CD was Pearl Jam's Ten
22-03-2019T01:42:36,SageSaga,but if ya like my work also consider perhaps- My kickstarter? https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1696155462/artificial-incident-book-one
22-03-2019T01:42:45,Deciem,the one I bought with my own money anyway
22-03-2019T01:42:46,SageSaga,(totally nailing these plugs...)
22-03-2019T01:42:51,Crawford,second one was greenday all star superhits
22-03-2019T01:42:57,NezumiYuki,"Good job, Sage!  :D"
22-03-2019T01:43:21,SageSaga,:D
22-03-2019T01:43:55,BadFoMo,Le Gasp! Sage is self pomoting in Peachyu's stream! Ban him!
22-03-2019T01:43:56,Mihari,Yah I'm seeing a lot of sources say The Visitors by ABBA was the first
22-03-2019T01:44:10,NezumiYuki,LOL FoMO!
22-03-2019T01:44:54,SageSaga,I had the Final Fantasy 6 PS1 release music CD
22-03-2019T01:46:00,NezumiYuki,I think I'd still be toying with Mario Sunshine IF i could remember where it went to....
22-03-2019T01:46:16,Peachyu,I know yall don't know me but what do you guys think of IN stream sommissions?
22-03-2019T01:46:24,SageSaga,I used to carry around a bright yellow hard case that carried 1.44mb floppys
22-03-2019T01:46:25,Peachyu,i'm thiking if i should start making those
22-03-2019T01:46:56,Mihari,"They are nice as long as you stick to taking them as you do them, I've seen many artists take on a big list and get overwhelmed so becareful."
22-03-2019T01:47:00,Deciem,this music is chill af
22-03-2019T01:47:30,Peachyu,ohh i see
22-03-2019T01:47:41,Peachyu,who @deciem?
22-03-2019T01:47:43,SageSaga,just remember if BGR asks for a commission dont take it- hes poor and has no money
22-03-2019T01:47:47,NezumiYuki,"Sound advice from Mihair, Peachyu.  Take on only what you can handle in your stream time frame.  :)"
22-03-2019T01:47:49,8EyedBoo,for in-stream it probably makes sense to stick to stuff you can do quickly.
22-03-2019T01:47:50,Ordithus,haha Sage
22-03-2019T01:47:55,Bgrmystr2,I don't ask for them anyway?
22-03-2019T01:48:00,Bgrmystr2,so.. sage pls
22-03-2019T01:48:07,SageSaga,:P
22-03-2019T01:48:12,Deciem,"Yeah, open a select number of slots if you do that"
22-03-2019T01:48:12,Bgrmystr2,"also, you'd take commission money upfront"
22-03-2019T01:48:20,Bgrmystr2,so that would end VERY quickly lol
22-03-2019T01:48:23,Mihari,"Don't take ZRO's either, they are all evil."
22-03-2019T01:48:25,SageSaga,yeah always take money up front
22-03-2019T01:48:30,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
22-03-2019T01:48:40,Peachyu,"if its in stream comm, no, full payment, if its a normal comms (outside stream) yeah i would"
22-03-2019T01:48:51,NezumiYuki,OMG Mihari!   xDD
22-03-2019T01:49:03,Peachyu,"i think for in stream i'd take headshots only , these are cute an fun to draw do yeah"
22-03-2019T01:49:09,Peachyu,"and """"easier"""""""
22-03-2019T01:49:24,Mihari,Your style reminds me a lot of another artist we had in here earlier today.
22-03-2019T01:49:30,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Peachyu, do you have a price sheet some were?"

22-03-2019T01:50:13,SageSaga,a bit cutter
22-03-2019T01:50:18,Mihari,True
22-03-2019T01:50:53,Mihari,Most importantly you don't do sausage tail.

22-03-2019T01:53:45,Peachyu,ohh ye ye
22-03-2019T01:53:50,unsteddyphoenix,good ol' early ron
22-03-2019T01:54:25,Crawford,lot of artists we found early on have gone on to grow as artists
22-03-2019T01:54:39,Crawford,and develop their own thing
22-03-2019T01:58:31,NezumiYuki,Back from other tabs~   Oh my gosh... Early Tom's twokinds stuff is GOLDEN  He sure grew as an artisan!
22-03-2019T01:58:54,ZRO4825,"Sage and Tom's early works are both world apart from their current stuff, and it's wonderful :)"
22-03-2019T01:59:10,SageSaga,I have become DECENT!
22-03-2019T01:59:14,Crawford,yay
22-03-2019T01:59:15,ZRO4825,XD
22-03-2019T01:59:17,SageSaga,though some would say indecent
22-03-2019T01:59:17,Ordithus,\o/
22-03-2019T01:59:21,Ordithus,lol
22-03-2019T01:59:23,NezumiYuki,"Pfffff only decent, Sage?"
22-03-2019T01:59:25,ZRO4825,"Nah, still too decent. :P"
22-03-2019T01:59:26,unsteddyphoenix,\o/
22-03-2019T01:59:31,unsteddyphoenix,Decently indecent!
22-03-2019T01:59:35,NezumiYuki,^
22-03-2019T01:59:53,unsteddyphoenix,"Started from indecently decent, and now we here"
22-03-2019T02:00:22,SageSaga,still - i am proud of my improvements even if i have followed in the footsteps of my lewdy old favorites
22-03-2019T02:00:36,Crawford,i blame( thank ) all the influences of the artists i follow for getting me into lewd art.
22-03-2019T02:00:45,NezumiYuki,"never forget your lewd roots, Sage!"
22-03-2019T02:00:59,NezumiYuki,Palpatine~  Let teh LEWD flow through you!
22-03-2019T02:01:06,Crawford,XD
22-03-2019T02:01:17,Bgrmystr2,ooo sage this page lookin nice
22-03-2019T02:01:20,SageSaga,my lewd roots were Ken Akamatsu
22-03-2019T02:01:32,ZRO4825,"Personally I think lewd art is just a given at some point. Then again I've always had a pretty nonchalant attitude towards nudity, and I'm firmly of the opinion that the female form is a beauty of its own."
22-03-2019T02:01:39,Bgrmystr2,that dude is a good root to have sage
22-03-2019T02:01:54,ZRO4825,"Well, at least nudity in artwork/shows. Nakedness is just a thing. lol"
22-03-2019T02:02:04,Crawford,"there was one artist i found bit i can't remember them, then it was arphalia then chalo and others from there"
22-03-2019T02:02:20,Crawford,found at first
22-03-2019T02:02:30,Bgrmystr2,Even ken Akamatsu was fully okay with showing full butts
22-03-2019T02:02:32,NezumiYuki,Oh Chalo san!   Another fine artisan with cute lewds! <3
22-03-2019T02:02:35,Bgrmystr2,sage doesn't even usually do that :u
22-03-2019T02:02:50,Ordithus,"Another nice page, Sage"
22-03-2019T02:02:53,SageSaga,ty
22-03-2019T02:02:57,ZRO4825,Lies. Sage has done so on occasion I think.
22-03-2019T02:03:07,ZRO4825,"Just not Nyna's butt, because she forgets how to wear panties."
22-03-2019T02:03:14,Bgrmystr2,"not 100% of it though,"
22-03-2019T02:03:18,ScorpDK,I have adopted and dropped artstyles over time. :V
22-03-2019T02:03:18,Bgrmystr2,it's always partially blocked
22-03-2019T02:03:24,Bgrmystr2,from what I recall
22-03-2019T02:03:27,Mihari,Ummmm hrm
22-03-2019T02:03:33,Mihari,Nah it's fine
22-03-2019T02:03:33,ZRO4825,"I love your art style personally, Scorp!"
22-03-2019T02:03:46,Mihari,She's not leaning far enough for that XD
22-03-2019T02:04:00,ScorpDK,My original style was pretty much Slayers 95 anime era.
22-03-2019T02:04:06,Mihari,Hehe
22-03-2019T02:04:11,Bgrmystr2,that was a good style tho
22-03-2019T02:04:15,Bgrmystr2,classic as hell
22-03-2019T02:04:23,8EyedBoo,"dang sage, I look away for just a sec it seems, and you've got it so cleaned up!"
22-03-2019T02:04:30,NezumiYuki,OMG Slayers!   xD   Lina and Naga... What a pair of misfits!
22-03-2019T02:04:44,Crawford,i found i drew like that as well scorp. adopting another artists style
22-03-2019T02:04:46,ScorpDK,"Sadly even the original anime artists couldn't keep it when they made the last movie and the 2 new seasons, years later. :v"
22-03-2019T02:04:52,SageSaga,that's my secret- it was always cleaned up
22-03-2019T02:05:01,SageSaga,that line really doesnt ever work
22-03-2019T02:05:10,NezumiYuki,LOL Sage!
22-03-2019T02:05:22,Crawford,but i learned alot and grew ( I hope) into my own

22-03-2019T14:24:49,SageSaga,i recommend neutral

22-03-2019T14:27:30,SageSaga,man i have 2 other stories i wanna make comics or books about but i dont know which one to do first

22-03-2019T14:34:49,Rosscoe,Nope.
22-03-2019T14:34:53,Rosscoe,not yet
22-03-2019T14:34:58,SageSaga,O_o

22-03-2019T14:35:02,Rosscoe,just bits in pieces getting colored

22-03-2019T14:35:27,SageSaga,come on Rosscoe- you've been following me for years! you know there's a website right?
22-03-2019T14:35:38,Rosscoe,Works been bleeding my dry
22-03-2019T14:35:42,Rosscoe,or trying too
22-03-2019T14:35:46,SageSaga,sorry to hear that man
22-03-2019T14:36:09,Rosscoe,Least I been able to keep up with Yosh! on tumblr >:3
22-03-2019T14:36:25,SageSaga,wut
22-03-2019T14:36:32,ZRO4825,Tumblr? People still use that without the porn? O_o
22-03-2019T14:36:54,Bgrmystr2,why would you use tumblr when the comic has a primary page to read it on...?
22-03-2019T14:36:55,SageSaga,my autoposter puts links to both ai and yosh when they update on there
22-03-2019T14:36:59,Rosscoe,I dont look at many comics while at work and YOSH! seems to load through XD
22-03-2019T14:37:18,SageSaga,but it doesnt put the whole comic on Tumblr
22-03-2019T14:37:41,Rosscoe,"I been able to read it via the link, its not blocked like AI's is at work ;3"
22-03-2019T14:37:54,SageSaga,how is AI blocked but Yosh isnt?
22-03-2019T14:38:01,SageSaga,its the SAME DOMAIN
22-03-2019T14:38:10,Rosscoe,"I dunno, it just is XD"
22-03-2019T14:38:27,SageSaga,"it's legit ""Sage.katbox.net"" for both of em!"
22-03-2019T14:38:42,Bgrmystr2,"that's the problem Ross, it can't be"
22-03-2019T14:38:47,Rosscoe,"Indeed,"
22-03-2019T14:38:56,Bgrmystr2,"if one is, the other one is, that's how domain blocking works"
22-03-2019T14:39:10,Rosscoe,"At work it goes through a intranet to the US then bounces to the wide web,"
22-03-2019T14:39:46,Rosscoe,I dunno what they do or use
22-03-2019T14:39:52,Rosscoe,I just know I can get into YOSH!
22-03-2019T14:40:14,Rosscoe,I wonder if I just change the last bit of the domain name it will let me in
22-03-2019T14:40:15,SageSaga,makes no sense
22-03-2019T14:40:24,Bgrmystr2,"yeh, agree w/ sage"
22-03-2019T14:40:52,Rosscoe,I also agree.
22-03-2019T14:41:14,Rosscoe,And its fustraiting.
22-03-2019T14:41:53,SageSaga,are you at work right now?
22-03-2019T14:42:04,Rosscoe,"No I just got home, going to go catch up on AI"
22-03-2019T14:42:13,SageSaga,goooood goooooooood
22-03-2019T14:42:31,Rosscoe,If you think you will rot my brain your sadly mistaken XD
22-03-2019T14:42:46,Mippy,Fun times with Kaylin and Nyna 😀
22-03-2019T14:43:08,Bgrmystr2,"Honestly, I think it's a bit ridiculous to think they would block AI of all pages and not Yosh. They probably don't even know the katbox exists, nevermind block one of the comics on it."
22-03-2019T14:43:23,Rosscoe,Katbox as a whole was blocked
22-03-2019T14:43:42,Bgrmystr2,then how does yosh work
22-03-2019T14:43:58,ZRO4825,It takes its time across over 2000 pages~ duh
22-03-2019T14:44:00,Rosscoe,Now I can access half of it
22-03-2019T14:44:09,SageSaga,maybe their admin reads yosh...
22-03-2019T14:44:36,Rosscoe,"And yet I can rea most of reddit, cept the main game subreddit XD"

22-03-2019T15:09:47,ZRO4825,"bleeeeh, I do *not* want to go to work today. Something been wrong with my left leg since last night, hurts like hell to walk on for some reason."
22-03-2019T15:09:56,ZRO4825,"This either gonna be a LONG night, or a very short one...not sure which."
22-03-2019T15:09:58,Rosscoe,Weather mayhaps?
22-03-2019T15:10:09,Rosscoe,I had where my figner broke years ago be in real pain at 2am
22-03-2019T15:10:14,Rosscoe,useually means a cold front coming
22-03-2019T15:10:15,Mippy,Did you sleep strangely?
22-03-2019T15:10:26,ZRO4825,"Possible, but I've never had trouble with weather and my body. Except my head. I get migraines when there's a sudden weather shift."
22-03-2019T15:10:40,ZRO4825,"And no, Mippy, not that I'm aware of. But then again, I was asleep, so idk."
22-03-2019T15:11:01,ZRO4825,"I got up earlier to go get me some Subway and it hurt like hell to walk, so I'm hoping whatever that was goes away."
22-03-2019T15:11:26,Rosscoe,I got some sore arms / shoudlers from push ups last night
22-03-2019T15:11:44,ZRO4825,Well at least yours are sore for a good reason. :rofl:
22-03-2019T15:12:08,Rosscoe,"I also have a sore smaller toe,"
22-03-2019T15:12:11,Mippy,One of my fish had babies
22-03-2019T15:12:18,Rosscoe,yay fish babies!
22-03-2019T15:13:26,SteelDragonFist,yo.
22-03-2019T15:13:32,Mippy,Yo
22-03-2019T15:15:23,Rosscoe,Heyo SDF!
22-03-2019T15:16:45,SteelDragonFist,Yo Roscoe.
22-03-2019T15:25:19,SteelDragonFist,that boucing neko really mesmerizes me.
22-03-2019T15:27:23,SageSaga,you can thank Maty for that
22-03-2019T15:29:09,SteelDragonFist,indeed.
22-03-2019T15:33:38,SteelDragonFist,Mihari and co. still fixing up Katbox?
22-03-2019T15:34:38,SageSaga,sorta- not sure who co. is in that- Mihari is doing most of it on her own which is why its taking a while
22-03-2019T15:35:12,Rosscoe,Lots of work.
22-03-2019T15:36:06,SageSaga,"we were like ""hey everyone! Since we have to do this big update anyways-you should all redesign your pages! It will really make the site pop!"" and everyone has been pretty much like ""Nah, just put the old look on my page"" =_="
22-03-2019T15:36:55,Bgrmystr2,lol.. if it ain't broke
22-03-2019T15:37:21,SageSaga,it is though
22-03-2019T15:37:33,Bgrmystr2,"the site, not the designs"
22-03-2019T15:37:41,Bgrmystr2,"can't break a design, it's a concept lol"
22-03-2019T15:37:54,SageSaga,but you can have dated or bad design
22-03-2019T15:38:02,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
22-03-2019T15:38:18,SageSaga,which hurts the site as a whole
22-03-2019T15:38:58,Bgrmystr2,visually? I dunno
22-03-2019T15:39:25,Bgrmystr2,it seemed fine to me before the update
22-03-2019T15:39:58,SageSaga,=_= how many times do I need to explain your personal experience is not representative of everyones
22-03-2019T15:40:36,Bgrmystr2,"That, too, applies to everyone else though. Why does the site get hurt when one person's page isn't visually updated?"
22-03-2019T15:40:47,Bgrmystr2,that's a two way street
22-03-2019T15:40:49,Bgrmystr2,not just one.
22-03-2019T15:41:13,SageSaga,because we can see the stats and the retention times and how worse looking pages affect that and that affects the site
22-03-2019T15:42:08,Bgrmystr2,which totally has nothin to do with the content of the page rather than just the visual eye-candy that surrounds it lol xD
22-03-2019T15:43:33,Bgrmystr2,I think there's too many variables to blame it on the visual aspect of how one page looks
22-03-2019T15:43:53,SageSaga,Yeah well you don't have the information we do
22-03-2019T15:44:36,Bgrmystr2,"I guess your information also includes the opinions of everyone who left that page quicker than the others, or why the comic gets less reads or etc"
22-03-2019T15:45:04,SageSaga,we have opinions on it yes- more than your singular one too
22-03-2019T15:46:14,Bgrmystr2,You say that as if my opinion is less valuable than any other singular opinion. :v
22-03-2019T15:46:38,SageSaga,no - im saying your singular opinion is less valuable than multiple others
22-03-2019T15:49:33,Bgrmystr2,"so you're telling me that the lil swirly stuff in the background of, say AI, which did not change at all, and the other menus and stuff"
22-03-2019T15:49:40,Bgrmystr2,which are different from pre-update
22-03-2019T15:49:55,Bgrmystr2,make the page look better and make people stay on it more?
22-03-2019T15:51:23,SageSaga,it improves retention and it's less cluttered - so yes- it also improves the overall appeal of the website itself
22-03-2019T15:52:04,SageSaga,everyone who has updated has seen small retention improvements while those who havent have seen less or the same as before
22-03-2019T15:52:20,Bgrmystr2,"it's even more cluttered than it was before, but okay."
22-03-2019T15:53:03,SageSaga,my site isnt even done yet as you can tell
22-03-2019T15:54:03,Bgrmystr2,"well, I was just using it as an example. Is there a better page? :o"
22-03-2019T15:54:43,SageSaga,no - of course not- as if there could even be a better page than mine- how foolish! :P
22-03-2019T15:54:56,Bgrmystr2,of course.. silly question.
22-03-2019T15:58:44,SageSaga,i dont really know why you would bother arguing this whole thing though- companies do this all the time for a reason
22-03-2019T15:59:33,SageSaga,Steam is getting ready to launch their new layout and design
22-03-2019T15:59:49,Bgrmystr2,companies change stuff because they get more money from the people who buy new stuff whether it's good or not as well as their investors
22-03-2019T16:00:11,Bgrmystr2,it's never been about whether the overall populous of their customers are happy
22-03-2019T16:00:36,Bgrmystr2,"in terms of money, we are irrelevant to their bottom line"
22-03-2019T16:00:57,Bgrmystr2,I don't think companies are a good comparison methinks
22-03-2019T16:01:01,SageSaga,of course so - when you go to a site- you dont care that it looks like it was made on geocities?
22-03-2019T16:01:18,Bgrmystr2,I never went to geocities so I can't actually say haha..
22-03-2019T16:01:44,SageSaga,Angelfire?
22-03-2019T16:01:51,Bgrmystr2,"hmm, naw"
22-03-2019T16:02:09,Bgrmystr2,I didn't do a whole lot of web surfing on the super classic sites like that
22-03-2019T16:02:10,MatyMaty,Sage
22-03-2019T16:02:14,SageSaga,*Old man shakes fist*
22-03-2019T16:02:17,MatyMaty,Geocities is retro now
22-03-2019T16:02:23,MatyMaty,a very ought after look :D
22-03-2019T16:02:24,SageSaga,thats my point Maty
22-03-2019T16:02:29,MatyMaty,sought*
22-03-2019T16:03:07,SageSaga,no one tries to make their stuff look retro online
22-03-2019T16:03:26,SageSaga,its all about MODERN! And like- stuff vanishing before it goes off the screen-
22-03-2019T16:03:30,MatyMaty,the official Captain Marvel website did
22-03-2019T16:03:43,SageSaga,that was because the movie took place in the 90s!
22-03-2019T16:03:53,MatyMaty,XD
22-03-2019T16:04:41,Rosscoe,90's
22-03-2019T16:04:49,Bgrmystr2,christ
22-03-2019T16:04:50,Rosscoe,no one knew what to do in the 90's
22-03-2019T16:05:05,Bgrmystr2,even the pre-change katbox is better than the captain marvel page..
22-03-2019T16:07:04,Bgrmystr2,"To be honest, a lot of my online stuff was mid or late 90s but also mostly to do with simcity.. and after 2000, sorta transitioned into stuff for Diablo2, halo, and bloodwake"
22-03-2019T16:07:06,SageSaga,honestly the tough part is we know that in the past updating the site always shows an uptick in users and retention for a while- but right now its hard to get the artists to make a new layout
22-03-2019T16:07:43,SageSaga,and then we only have one person capable of making it all work and shes stressed as all get out
22-03-2019T16:08:31,Bgrmystr2,"okay so you weren't talkin about the same thing I was, I see why I was a confuse"
22-03-2019T16:10:53,Bgrmystr2,"I did always feel like both sides of the pages just felt like wasted space, but adding a banner on the side when it was all already available from a small, toolbar at the top.. ehh"
22-03-2019T16:11:28,Bgrmystr2,Yeh I can see your point
22-03-2019T16:13:29,SageSaga,"its the ""Fresh coat of paint"" thing- people are more attracted to things that look new- sure the plan is to get them to keep coming back for the content but if the site itself turns them away then thats a problem we can fix"
22-03-2019T16:15:20,Bgrmystr2,"yeah I feel that. I figured you were just keeping the buttons and other stuff where they were and just changing some wallpapers and banners.. and while that may change a little, I don't think it'll affect the long run enough to warrant that miniscule chan"
22-03-2019T16:15:31,Bgrmystr2,change*
22-03-2019T16:15:50,Bgrmystr2,but changing all of the buttons and the placement of everything is a lot
22-03-2019T16:16:12,SageSaga,the main placement of buttons and stuff will remain the same on most sites- Mihari is playing with mine a bit
22-03-2019T16:17:14,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: I'll have to see when it's done
22-03-2019T16:18:43,SageSaga,Mihari is curious if a style more like what Tom has is more appropriate
22-03-2019T16:19:08,SageSaga,if gives bit of room for more things to be seen along side the comic- which might improve visability
22-03-2019T16:19:13,Bgrmystr2,tom's page feels suuuuper cluttered to me.
22-03-2019T16:19:14,SageSaga,visibility *
22-03-2019T16:19:45,Bgrmystr2,"but everything is visually there seen, so there's that."
22-03-2019T16:20:23,SageSaga,most people who visit the katbox comics dont go past the bottom of the comic
22-03-2019T16:20:51,SageSaga,the only ones who do are the ones in the comment section- and many of them dont even read the artist blurb thing under the comic
22-03-2019T16:21:10,Bgrmystr2,"""Blurb"" lol"
22-03-2019T16:21:48,Bgrmystr2,"I do notice all the stuff underneath, myself, though I don't comment"
22-03-2019T16:22:05,SageSaga,Blurb is a real thing! I didnt make it up!
22-03-2019T16:22:26,Bgrmystr2,it sounds like a sound a bird would make when drowning
22-03-2019T16:22:32,SageSaga,it's like a comment or ad that goes along with a piece of work
22-03-2019T16:22:44,SageSaga,ima google it!
22-03-2019T16:22:56,Bgrmystr2,I already searched it
22-03-2019T16:22:58,SageSaga,A blurb is a short promotional piece accompanying a creative work. It may be written by the author or publisher or quote praise from others.
22-03-2019T16:23:22,Bgrmystr2,I'm disappointed more every second that I know that is a thing.
22-03-2019T16:23:52,SageSaga,most things are things
22-03-2019T16:24:07,Bgrmystr2,"I guess ""comment"" was too much of a hassle"
22-03-2019T16:24:10,Bgrmystr2,so they made a shorter word xD
22-03-2019T16:24:22,MatyMaty,it is not the same
22-03-2019T16:24:31,MatyMaty,a blurb is like
22-03-2019T16:25:51,SageSaga,the 10 commandments
22-03-2019T16:25:52,MatyMaty,"when you buy a book you might get like, a small text with what critics have said"
22-03-2019T16:26:03,MatyMaty,or the amount of copies it has sold
22-03-2019T16:26:11,SageSaga,the 10 commandments are the blurb of God!
22-03-2019T16:26:24,SageSaga,"""I created this- here are my rules!"""
22-03-2019T16:26:54,MatyMaty,Nothing like following rules made by bronze age sheepherds 3000 years ago :D
22-03-2019T16:26:57,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: that just makes it worse.
22-03-2019T16:27:17,SageSaga,hey most of those rules stand up today
22-03-2019T16:27:26,Bgrmystr2,well yeah nothing against them
22-03-2019T16:27:42,SageSaga,im a big fan of the not killing
22-03-2019T16:27:47,Bgrmystr2,haha
22-03-2019T16:28:28,MatyMaty,That was already a rule before the 10 commandments  came to be :P
22-03-2019T16:29:27,SageSaga,yeah but it popularized it! XD
22-03-2019T16:30:30,MatyMaty,XD
22-03-2019T16:31:14,Rosscoe,"So if were not suppose to be killing, yet we still kill animals for food XD"
22-03-2019T16:31:50,MatyMaty,humans have done that for like
22-03-2019T16:31:57,MatyMaty,half a million years?
22-03-2019T16:32:09,Rosscoe,I was goan saw dawn of the first prime ape man
22-03-2019T16:32:15,Rosscoe,gona*
22-03-2019T16:32:19,Rosscoe,say*
22-03-2019T16:42:52,Rosscoe,There needs to be a Nyan plushie.
22-03-2019T16:43:18,SageSaga,Nyna*
22-03-2019T16:43:29,Rosscoe,face palms
22-03-2019T16:43:40,Rosscoe,Why do I keep putting the N and A backwards
22-03-2019T16:45:40,Bgrmystr2,because nyan is the sound a cat makes
22-03-2019T16:48:18,Bgrmystr2,so.. back with food. Had to step away cuz they were spraying right outside my window for two bee nests
22-03-2019T16:48:25,Bgrmystr2,and it came right through..
22-03-2019T16:50:12,SageSaga,the spray i assume- because if the bees came right through they have phasing technology and we are all in trouble
22-03-2019T16:51:20,Bgrmystr2,..yes.
22-03-2019T16:51:26,Bgrmystr2,definitely the spray
22-03-2019T16:51:39,Bgrmystr2,can confirm the bees do not have phasing technology that I can see.
22-03-2019T16:52:00,SageSaga,*meanwhile* Bees are holding a gun to Bgr's head and telling him what to type
22-03-2019T16:52:16,Bgrmystr2,:bee: *THIS IS NOT YOUR FIGHT HUMAN*
22-03-2019T17:05:49,SageSaga,man if designing and having a Nyna plushie wasnt so expensive i'd do it
22-03-2019T17:06:12,SageSaga,having a nyna plushie manufactured*
22-03-2019T17:07:04,Bgrmystr2,"then don't. Design and have a REAL nyna manufactured. get a grant from the govt to fuel scienece, and you're golden."
22-03-2019T17:07:08,SageSaga,one of my friends worked with the company that made the giant rabbit plushie from Iron Man 3 to have their made-
22-03-2019T17:07:17,Bgrmystr2,the kids at MIT would probably love to work on it too
22-03-2019T17:07:24,SageSaga,they were terrible
22-03-2019T17:07:42,Rosscoe,That just sounds terrible reading how terrible it was
22-03-2019T17:08:09,SageSaga,ive seen some really good plushie makers though
22-03-2019T17:08:12,Bgrmystr2,the giant rabbit plush from Iron man 3? I don't recall..
22-03-2019T17:08:27,SageSaga,yeah he buys it for Pepper as a sorry gift-
22-03-2019T17:08:38,SageSaga,it looks like it had boobs
22-03-2019T17:08:45,SageSaga,and no arms
22-03-2019T17:09:01,Rosscoe,XD
22-03-2019T17:10:27,Bgrmystr2,oooooooh that one
22-03-2019T17:12:14,SageSaga,here's the video of it - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZUSXwCl0xI
22-03-2019T17:13:59,Bgrmystr2,"haha that comment No they don't need to worry about that. Nothing to do with the plot, nope"
22-03-2019T17:14:18,Bgrmystr2,but yeah I found the vid before you linked it
22-03-2019T17:14:43,Bgrmystr2,"but yeah I recall it now, it's just.. too busy looking at the michael bay explosions."
22-03-2019T17:15:13,SageSaga,well that bunny was poorly designed- and a lot of their plushies are terrible
22-03-2019T17:15:55,SageSaga,"so my friend was like ""If you decide to get plush figures done- dont use those people"""
22-03-2019T17:16:04,Bgrmystr2,haha
22-03-2019T17:17:14,SageSaga,i mean seriously- they made it look like it has boobs-
22-03-2019T17:17:32,Bgrmystr2,they did.
22-03-2019T17:17:41,Bgrmystr2,"one sec, my room is like 86"
22-03-2019T17:19:34,Bgrmystr2,I dunno how the hell this house has this garbage of an AC
22-03-2019T17:19:56,Bgrmystr2,The rest of the house is 77 and the back of it is closer to 70
22-03-2019T17:23:53,RimaDraws,hiiii
22-03-2019T17:24:10,SageSaga,yo Rima
22-03-2019T17:27:16,RimaDraws,^^
22-03-2019T17:33:57,Rosscoe,Time to upgrade AC
22-03-2019T17:34:36,Bgrmystr2,We did when we moved in.
22-03-2019T17:36:01,Bgrmystr2,"I think it's part to do with a halfass job, part to do with the guy who lives here wanting all the cool air only in the back for himself, and part to do with the AC he recommending isn't enough for the whole house, just enough for where he's at."
22-03-2019T17:36:12,Bgrmystr2,he recommended*
22-03-2019T17:38:02,Bgrmystr2,Page is lookin nice sage
22-03-2019T17:41:00,RimaDraws,it is ^^
22-03-2019T17:45:10,SageSaga,i think im done-
22-03-2019T17:46:26,RimaDraws,yayyy
22-03-2019T17:46:38,Bgrmystr2,nice :O
22-03-2019T17:47:52,SageSaga,everything under that purple line gets cut
22-03-2019T17:48:35,Bgrmystr2,aww
22-03-2019T17:48:41,Rosscoe,Such is comic life
22-03-2019T17:48:45,Bgrmystr2,is that for the book though?
22-03-2019T17:48:55,Bgrmystr2,are you gonna have the full page on the site?
22-03-2019T17:48:56,SageSaga,everything is for the book...
22-03-2019T17:50:09,SageSaga,i'll crop this based on how it looks with the text- dont want too much white space- but the whole thing is submitted for printing- its just when they trim it that line is the bleed line
22-03-2019T17:50:32,SageSaga,and the bleed line gets cut - sometimes its not perfect though so you need the image to go over a bit
22-03-2019T17:50:57,SageSaga,see these 3 lines?
22-03-2019T17:51:10,Bgrmystr2,yeh
22-03-2019T17:51:20,SageSaga,anything past the purple line should be cut from the page completely-
22-03-2019T17:51:41,SageSaga,but it could cut as far in as the next line
22-03-2019T17:51:56,Bgrmystr2,"so why do you have part of the artwork, like where Nyna is sitting and such, wayy far beyond?"
22-03-2019T17:52:02,Nekonny,I'm honestly surprised that they havent eliminated more of the bleed area
22-03-2019T17:52:03,SageSaga,that last line is the safe zone 100% no cuts
22-03-2019T17:52:29,SageSaga,to make sure
22-03-2019T17:52:32,Nekonny,"or rather, mid range area or whatever it's refereed to"
22-03-2019T17:52:42,Nekonny,you know what sucks though sage
22-03-2019T17:52:48,SageSaga,?
22-03-2019T17:52:57,Nekonny,you can't even place borders near the cut off zone
22-03-2019T17:53:03,Nekonny,"like, panel borders"
22-03-2019T17:53:16,Nekonny,because theres no real guarentee that they will shift
22-03-2019T17:53:21,SageSaga,?
22-03-2019T17:53:36,Nekonny,"even if they are in the ""protected zone"""
22-03-2019T17:54:01,SageSaga,i dont see how thats a problem
22-03-2019T17:54:34,Nekonny,say you have a panel border running up the side of one of those lines
22-03-2019T17:54:44,Nekonny,and the page prints crooked
22-03-2019T17:55:05,Nekonny,you'll have this ugly uneven white line running though half a panel or the whole page
22-03-2019T17:55:23,SageSaga,so i should do this-
22-03-2019T17:55:43,Nekonny,yeah
22-03-2019T17:55:45,Nekonny,that works
22-03-2019T17:57:05,Nekonny,"sometimes the isuse isn't just left/right shifts, sometimes the page can plint ever so slightly crooked"
22-03-2019T17:57:14,Rosscoe,Pokes the Orange cat
22-03-2019T17:57:34,Nekonny,so it ends up being dangerous to have borders  that venture into the bleed area
22-03-2019T17:57:44,Nekonny,oh heya rosscoe
22-03-2019T17:58:04,SageSaga,ty Ron
22-03-2019T17:58:05,Nekonny,"in my case, I got hit with that on the paprika print"
22-03-2019T17:58:12,Nekonny,np
22-03-2019T17:58:29,Rosscoe,"Wait, you got a Paprika print done up?"
22-03-2019T17:58:42,Nekonny,"paprika, imew, cb"
22-03-2019T17:58:46,Nekonny,they were all printed
22-03-2019T17:58:50,Rosscoe,I know CB was done
22-03-2019T17:58:54,Rosscoe,I have all 3 :D

22-03-2019T17:59:20,Nekonny,\o/
22-03-2019T17:59:27,Rosscoe,House purchase is at the top sadly
22-03-2019T17:59:45,Nekonny,"right, that is indeed important!"
22-03-2019T18:00:59,Rosscoe,Hopefully go check out a farm house built in 1915 that isstil lstanding better then the houses from the 70's XD
22-03-2019T18:01:54,SageSaga,i thought someone might have become a new backer for my Kickstarter- but nope- someone just increased their pledge XD
22-03-2019T18:02:10,Rosscoe,Lemon pledge +1
