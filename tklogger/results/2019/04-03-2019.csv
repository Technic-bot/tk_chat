04-03-2019T13:24:46,TerraTheWizard,i didn;t know what they're supposed to be called
04-03-2019T13:25:00,TerraTheWizard,"so i've been refering to them as a ""fox mustache"""

04-03-2019T15:13:21,SpazztasticKiwi,And I see Tom got ice cream..?
04-03-2019T15:14:51,Bgrmystr2,or you simply mentioned ice cream

04-03-2019T15:29:35,Azumachan,I charged my kimchi a bit
04-03-2019T16:01:00,SpazztasticKiwi,My brain tripped over that word for a second
04-03-2019T16:01:42,SpazztasticKiwi,I got a chocolate twist pastry
04-03-2019T16:08:30,tehbear,supercharged kimchi?
04-03-2019T16:17:15,Azumachan,I used a Strong pepper paste
04-03-2019T16:25:35,Twokinds,I hate winter.
04-03-2019T16:25:43,Twokinds,I'm so cold. I can't draw when cold.
04-03-2019T16:26:19,iliar,You have no heating at home?
04-03-2019T16:28:29,iliar,And Tom. I think gallery ready to use. http://twokinds.gallery/
04-03-2019T16:29:01,iliar,Perhaps some things can be done better. But I think already well.
04-03-2019T16:33:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Get a small space heater for your room
04-03-2019T16:33:54,SpazztasticKiwi,I got one. Toasty
04-03-2019T16:34:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera likes it too
04-03-2019T16:34:35,Twokinds,"That's pretty neat, iliar"
04-03-2019T16:35:27,iliar,"On mobile devices, it does not work well."
04-03-2019T16:36:17,iliar,If you click on the plus you can do a search for several parameters.
04-03-2019T16:38:02,iliar,And I do not know what to do with the arts that you did not publish. I mean like this https://yadi.sk/i/gUH9TjJJDPHVhg
04-03-2019T16:44:51,Twokinds,Nothing?
04-03-2019T16:46:13,iliar,Okay. Although I would prefer it to be in the gallery too.
04-03-2019T16:48:13,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, it was posted on reddit so.."
04-03-2019T16:48:43,SpazztasticKiwi,It works ok with mobile for me
04-03-2019T16:52:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Why not publish it? Saving it for a book or something?
04-03-2019T16:54:48,iliar,"Well, another example. https://yadi.sk/i/hZ-ZzUc0-3aA-A This is Tom's art, but Tom did not publish it."
04-03-2019T16:55:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Now that
04-03-2019T16:55:29,SpazztasticKiwi,I love
04-03-2019T16:55:44,Bgrmystr2,if he didn't publish it.. how is it even available to post online bro
04-03-2019T16:56:03,iliar,This is a gallery with links. I can not add this art to the gallery if it does not have any links.
04-03-2019T16:56:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Took me a second with the other. Especially to realize it was a Mets thing
04-03-2019T16:56:41,SpazztasticKiwi,I do not sports
04-03-2019T16:56:57,SpazztasticKiwi,"If you did put it in without a link, what would happen"
04-03-2019T16:57:29,iliar,I'm pretty sure Tom is not angry with me for posting this sketch.
04-03-2019T17:02:49,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt want to just shoot out of left field from this conversation but have any of you seen sushi burgers
04-03-2019T17:05:07,Bgrmystr2,I've heard of them and I don't think I can legit call that sushi or burger based on the definition of the two.. but I also do not even want to know how people attempt.
04-03-2019T17:09:41,SpazztasticKiwi,example http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/257095598/sushi-burger-instagram.jpg
04-03-2019T17:10:39,Bgrmystr2,":ptv-confused: to be fair, I am actually impressed how anyone could call that a burger.."
04-03-2019T17:11:04,Twokinds,I could go for some sushi
04-03-2019T17:13:38,iliar,"It reminds me of how I cook ""lazy sushi"". I just cook the rice, cut the salmon into pieces, rush them together and add soy sauce with wasabi. The result does not look like sushi, but its taste is very similar."
04-03-2019T17:16:57,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve never had
04-03-2019T17:17:36,SpazztasticKiwi,But I‚Äôd try it at least if there was a place anywhere close
04-03-2019T17:27:51,SpazztasticKiwi,I got cousins over. They have stolen the kitchen
04-03-2019T17:28:54,Twokinds,Fight back

04-03-2019T18:05:45,SpazztasticKiwi,They‚Äôre cooking
04-03-2019T18:05:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Why would I fight em
04-03-2019T18:25:46,Dadrobit,"Actually just got back from a date. I wouldn't call it a disaster, but I don't think there's gonna be a second."
04-03-2019T18:26:19,Dadrobit,"Was a lady I'd been chatting up on Tinder for a few weeks, wanted to meet up for coffee and a movie."
04-03-2019T18:26:57,Dadrobit,Was going pretty well actually during the coffee part of it. Until she mentioned that she preferred men with short hair.
04-03-2019T18:27:12,Dadrobit,So I mentioned that I preferred the same.
04-03-2019T18:27:40,unsteddyphoenix,Men with short hair?
04-03-2019T18:27:45,Dadrobit,"""Why don't you cut your hair then, Dadrobit?"" ""Oh, I meant that I like women with short hair."""
04-03-2019T18:27:56,unsteddyphoenix,Ah
04-03-2019T18:28:12,Dadrobit,She looked at me like I just admitted that I preferred molesting the nuns more than the orphan children.
04-03-2019T18:28:55,Dadrobit,Her demeanor through the rest of the coffee was barely more excitable than that of a dead fish.
04-03-2019T18:29:08,Dadrobit,And she ghosted me for the movie part afterwards.
04-03-2019T18:29:25,Dadrobit,"On the bright side, How To Train Your Dragon 3 was pretty good."
04-03-2019T18:29:55,unsteddyphoenix,That simile is very confusing
04-03-2019T18:30:05,unsteddyphoenix,But hey thats...good to hear?
04-03-2019T18:31:05,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I was worried that they were going to milk that franchise to a prolonged demise, but it actually had a pretty solid conclusion."
04-03-2019T18:31:21,SpazztasticKiwi,So
04-03-2019T18:31:27,SpazztasticKiwi,It crashed
04-03-2019T18:31:28,SpazztasticKiwi,?
04-03-2019T18:33:10,Dadrobit,"Also, I'm not sure what part of that you didn't understand, dead fish don't have the greatest outwards demeanor, and hers was only slightly better."
04-03-2019T18:33:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Shame
04-03-2019T18:34:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve gotten to where there‚Äôs definitely things I find more attractive but I‚Äôm also not blind
04-03-2019T18:34:48,unsteddyphoenix,No the nuns and the orphans
04-03-2019T18:35:27,Dadrobit,"Oh, I thought that was pretty self explanatory."
04-03-2019T18:37:16,unsteddyphoenix,"Hm, I mean I got the intent"
04-03-2019T18:37:27,Dadrobit,She had a look of unbridled horror and disgust at becoming aware of my preference for shorter hair on women.
04-03-2019T18:37:53,Dadrobit,It was just the best comparison that I could think of off the top of my head.
04-03-2019T18:38:13,unsteddyphoenix,Understandable have a nice day
04-03-2019T18:49:42,Dadrobit,"Ah, and she has officially removed my contact from Tinder as well. Guess that's GG then."
04-03-2019T18:50:09,unsteddyphoenix,Woah. You know its seriously over when they actually remove you
04-03-2019T18:50:19,unsteddyphoenix,And not just leave your match there and ignore you
04-03-2019T18:50:23,unsteddyphoenix,For whatever reason
04-03-2019T18:51:14,Dadrobit,I don't think much anything was lost honestly. She suffered from uptalk and I'd have probably ended it sooner rather than later for that.
04-03-2019T18:52:25,unsteddyphoenix,"Ah, uptalk is normally incurable. Good dodge"
04-03-2019T19:08:57,CrRAR,"Darn robit, 0 for2. Something‚Äôs bound to come your way!"
04-03-2019T19:09:07,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-rainehappy:
04-03-2019T19:15:18,Dadrobit,"Yeah, no worries. It's not my first rodeo, just my first date in a while."

04-03-2019T19:34:24,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-awoo:
04-03-2019T19:34:32,Bgrmystr2,don't think skillz could change that person's opinion on their own hair.
