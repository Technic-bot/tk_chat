22-04-2019T01:20:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Does Nora have a last name
22-04-2019T01:26:12,Twokinds,Nora
22-04-2019T01:28:48,iliar,If Nora is last name then what first name is?
22-04-2019T01:31:10,iliar,Also Nora? And then the full name Lady Nora Nora?
22-04-2019T01:31:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Nora Nora
22-04-2019T01:32:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Got it. Give her another Nora and you can do a beetlejuice summon
22-04-2019T01:38:22,iliar,Nora Summon Nora? Sounds good. Nora Nora Nora.... Hm nothing happened.
22-04-2019T01:44:48,iliar,"Although I am more amused by the idea that the Nora's childrens will have the same last name. Bob Nora, Alice Nora etc."
22-04-2019T01:46:20,Bgrmystr2,"This is probably one of those instances where they, in this case, Dragons, or Nora specifically, do not have last names. Or first names. Just names. And that's it."
22-04-2019T01:46:27,SpazztasticKiwi,There is an off key cricket in my room and I‚Äôm about to go on a crusade if he doesn‚Äôt shut up
22-04-2019T01:46:37,Bgrmystr2,so.. I'm just gonna call shenanigans on this one.
22-04-2019T01:53:24,iliar,And of course Nora Trace Jr.
22-04-2019T01:53:25,iliar,"^ I'm really not sure how to spell it. In Russian, we do not use the ""Jr."" and I'm not quite sure how it works."
22-04-2019T01:54:19,Bgrmystr2,"Basically, if you name your child after you, they're a junior, or Jr, and you're the Senior, or Sr."
22-04-2019T01:54:44,Bgrmystr2,"In fact, my dad is a Jr, his father is a Sr, and I'm the third."
22-04-2019T01:54:45,Bgrmystr2,xd
22-04-2019T01:55:07,Bgrmystr2,..xD* So I can definitely say I know it firsthand
22-04-2019T01:56:35,Bgrmystr2,"My dad and his dad all have the same first and last name, the only differences is middle name (I presume?) and the order of age, which is as said above."
22-04-2019T01:56:46,SpazztasticKiwi,"Even with me expected to be a boy, they didn‚Äôt try going with giving me my dads name"
22-04-2019T01:57:12,Bgrmystr2,"surprise, it's a girl"
22-04-2019T01:58:33,Bgrmystr2,":ptv-confused: ""Welp, I guess the room with racecars and robots and other stuff.. I'll sleep in it or whatever"" - Kiwi's dad on finding out Kiwi was a girl.. probably."
22-04-2019T01:59:21,Bgrmystr2,So much for the blue colors and cool flames lol
22-04-2019T01:59:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Well I got most of my sisters stuff in the end of course but they hadn‚Äôt jumped the gun on the off chance the doctors did end up being wrong
22-04-2019T01:59:36,Bgrmystr2,haha
22-04-2019T01:59:42,SpazztasticKiwi,The doctors did tho
22-04-2019T01:59:50,Bgrmystr2,I know at least one person if I recall correctly.. that had accidentally
22-04-2019T01:59:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Born in the blue room. Blue blanket ready
22-04-2019T02:00:23,Bgrmystr2,"and the parents were prepared so much for a boy, had a room prepared and all these toys ready and.. it was a girl"
22-04-2019T02:00:46,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúWell shit‚Ñ¢Ô∏è‚Äù
22-04-2019T02:00:52,Bgrmystr2,hahaha right?
22-04-2019T02:01:33,Bgrmystr2,I don't remember what they did though
22-04-2019T02:02:58,SpazztasticKiwi,"My cousin recently shared that her young son asked her, very loudly in the middle of a store, why girls didn‚Äôt have, well guess"
22-04-2019T02:03:22,SpazztasticKiwi,God help me if I have a boy
22-04-2019T02:03:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"If I have kids period, actually"
22-04-2019T02:03:43,Bgrmystr2,Welp. :bird::bee:
22-04-2019T02:05:22,Bgrmystr2,"All you have to do is tell them ""That's part of how kids are made. But you don't have to worry about that because you haven't grown yet."""
22-04-2019T02:05:25,Bgrmystr2,or something to that sort.
22-04-2019T02:06:00,Bgrmystr2,"Just.. something simple, yet not lies. Nothing objectively false or they'll give ya shit for it later lol"
22-04-2019T02:06:17,Bgrmystr2,Fuckin storks man.
22-04-2019T02:06:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Nothing like that poor woman I read about whose little girl went up to what had to be the scariest dark skin man in the room and asked ‚Äúare you made of chocolate?‚Äù
22-04-2019T02:06:43,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-laugh: aw
22-04-2019T02:07:26,Bgrmystr2,"and kids could just connect that too, cuz chocolate can be the same color."
22-04-2019T02:07:45,Bgrmystr2,so it could totally just be innocence
22-04-2019T02:08:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I know someone who saw a picture of Mark and asked me if he was Indian
22-04-2019T02:08:49,Bgrmystr2,10/10 deduction 100
22-04-2019T02:09:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Not bringing her to a convention/10
22-04-2019T02:09:29,Bgrmystr2,xD
22-04-2019T02:10:07,SpazztasticKiwi,The rest of the room face palmed with me though so there‚Äôs that
22-04-2019T02:13:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I shouldn‚Äôt eat chocolate before bed
22-04-2019T02:14:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I have plenty of get up and go now but nowhere to go

22-04-2019T11:02:02,Twokinds,The post scheduler got mixed up
22-04-2019T11:02:03,CrimsonQuill,A mistake in posting?
22-04-2019T11:02:06,CrimsonQuill,I see.
22-04-2019T11:02:28,Twokinds,It had to happen eventually
22-04-2019T11:03:02,CrimsonQuill,"So, is the Adelaide one not published yet, or did it just publish two at once by accident?"

22-04-2019T11:04:40,iliar,Sly bots have already sent a post in many places.
22-04-2019T11:04:51,Twokinds,I mean whatever it was on the stream
22-04-2019T11:05:20,Azumachan,They looks great Tom
22-04-2019T11:05:28,CrimsonQuill,"Top notch, I may say."
22-04-2019T11:05:44,Twokinds,I unpublished it.
22-04-2019T11:05:44,CrimsonQuill,Though Keith looks very badly injured...worried now...
22-04-2019T11:05:59,Twokinds,It'll be posted tomorrow
22-04-2019T11:06:30,CrimsonQuill,Which one? Feral Nat or Adelaide Lift?
22-04-2019T11:07:08,Azumachan,Adelaide

22-04-2019T11:07:46,CrimsonQuill,So we'll be seeing that tomorrow...
22-04-2019T11:08:41,TerraTheWizard,holy wow
22-04-2019T11:08:52,TerraTheWizard,me like this sketch :ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
22-04-2019T11:09:31,iliar,Or you can go to the discord and see a copy right now)
22-04-2019T11:09:47,CrimsonQuill,LOL
22-04-2019T11:09:55,Azumachan,Nib is fast
22-04-2019T11:10:13,CrimsonQuill,She's a squirrel-it's only to be expected.

22-04-2019T11:10:52,iliar,* Perhaps I need to demand from Neon money for advertising.
22-04-2019T11:10:58,Azumachan,Nib's reff written in squirrel.
22-04-2019T11:11:13,CrimsonQuill,That'd be like the CV written in Groot...
22-04-2019T11:11:48,Azumachan,or the Hodor's chapters
22-04-2019T11:14:24,iliar,"When I created Nibs, I deliberately made it so that she sends incorrect requests. This increases the load on Patreon servers, but it works faster."
22-04-2019T11:17:52,Azumachan,how so ?
22-04-2019T11:20:19,Twokinds,The Adelaide sketch was unfinished.
22-04-2019T11:20:26,Twokinds,Tomorrow the finished version will be posted. XD
22-04-2019T11:20:50,Twokinds,( I cleaned it up some more so now the version will be different than the one posted today lol )

22-04-2019T11:24:12,Twokinds,Honestly all I did was make the background characters not have circles for faces

22-04-2019T12:45:40,iliar,170?
22-04-2019T12:46:08,Twokinds,"5'7""? That seems a bit short"
22-04-2019T12:47:28,iliar,"6'0""?"
22-04-2019T12:47:48,Twokinds,Well that's a big difference
22-04-2019T12:47:58,iliar,He doesn't look very tall.
22-04-2019T12:48:17,Twokinds,I'm just trying to figure out if he's taller or shorter than rose
22-04-2019T12:49:16,iliar,"I think somewhere you mentioned that Trace 5'8"" or something like this."
22-04-2019T12:49:29,Twokinds,Yeah
22-04-2019T12:49:45,Twokinds,He's taller than Trace
22-04-2019T12:50:09,Azumachan,so about the same ?
22-04-2019T12:51:11,iliar,"Yes, I already see that on page 1007 it is slightly higher. http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/1007/"
22-04-2019T12:51:42,iliar,"That's why I suggested 6'0"""
22-04-2019T12:53:32,iliar,",Although I am surprised. For some reason I thought that Trace and Red are pretty low."
22-04-2019T12:54:19,Twokinds,All the heights started out shorter because I was younger and shorter when I started.
22-04-2019T12:54:44,Twokinds,Everyone's sorta either grown a little or shrunk a little to make them more different from one another over time.
22-04-2019T12:54:50,iliar,"Yes, I already noticed it"

22-04-2019T12:56:37,iliar,but in centimeters the numbers are different.
22-04-2019T12:57:12,iliar,^ I mean Natani
22-04-2019T12:57:48,iliar,I like a pair of characters of different heights. So I watched her grow.
22-04-2019T12:59:44,Twokinds,Yeah for sure

22-04-2019T13:18:44,CrimsonQuill,How tall is Natani?
22-04-2019T13:19:15,TerraTheWizard,"yeah, imperial measurements are terrible"
22-04-2019T13:19:27,TerraTheWizard,nat is 6'3
22-04-2019T13:20:30,CrimsonQuill,So same height as me.
22-04-2019T13:20:37,Twokinds,Have I ever drawn Red as a kid?
22-04-2019T13:20:40,CrimsonQuill,I'd be seeing the gender confused wolf eye-to eye.
22-04-2019T13:20:46,CrimsonQuill,"I don't think so, Tom."

22-04-2019T13:21:09,CrimsonQuill,I rather like Red.
22-04-2019T13:21:27,SpazztasticKiwi,the imperial system makes it hard to convert and adapt to the more sane metric system mainly because it was created by a drunk mathmatian rolling dice
22-04-2019T13:21:43,Azumachan,Such a mysterious plant too.

22-04-2019T16:32:54,MarvTheHugPharaoh,She's too cute Ron
22-04-2019T16:33:08,BadFoMo,@Nekonny That looked interesting.
22-04-2019T16:33:35,Nekonny,Been working on this thing for a long while
22-04-2019T16:33:45,Nekonny,hopefully it will be done in time
22-04-2019T16:33:48,BadFoMo,What's it for?
22-04-2019T16:34:33,Nekonny,Animation for Anthrocon
22-04-2019T16:34:48,BadFoMo,Cool.
22-04-2019T16:34:51,microbuss,oh earlier there were some scumbags on Picarto
22-04-2019T16:35:02,Azumachan,What's the soft ?
22-04-2019T16:35:02,SkiddArt,I see my skill have passed on to a better use/place
22-04-2019T16:35:20,BadFoMo,Yo.
22-04-2019T16:35:25,Nekonny,Yay Skidd
22-04-2019T16:35:37,Nekonny,Skidd taught me everything I know
22-04-2019T16:35:37,SkiddArt,You look like you've learned a LOT of new things in this Neko. :O
22-04-2019T16:35:44,Nekonny,oh yeah XD
22-04-2019T16:35:55,SkiddArt,Kinda makes me wanna pick it back up
22-04-2019T16:36:06,SkiddArt,You can teach Me all YOU know
22-04-2019T16:36:34,Nekonny,XD
22-04-2019T16:36:35,Nekonny,sure
22-04-2019T16:37:37,Nekonny,Although I'm sorta inclined to recomend Live 2D
22-04-2019T16:37:54,Reaps,My only thing about that animation is the eyes :.
22-04-2019T16:37:56,Reaps,:/
22-04-2019T16:38:09,Reaps,I keep feeling that they should move or blink
22-04-2019T16:38:27,SkiddArt,I heard about live 2d
22-04-2019T16:38:36,SkiddArt,But dont you gotta have a subscription to use that?
22-04-2019T16:39:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Live 2d has a free version on their site
22-04-2019T16:40:10,Nekonny,"No,"
22-04-2019T16:40:21,Nekonny,ALrthough I think you have to buy the program?
22-04-2019T16:40:28,Nekonny,or do you? I don't quite remember
22-04-2019T16:40:48,microbuss,ok nuts gtg ugh
22-04-2019T16:40:54,Nekonny,Perhaps it was the facetracking extention
22-04-2019T16:40:55,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"""After a 42-day trial of PRO version, the editor will automatically switch to FREE version"" thats what the site says"
22-04-2019T16:41:00,Nekonny,"Yeah,  I think that was it"
22-04-2019T16:44:29,Nekonny,"Over the past few months... Ive worked on a lot of these ""puppet animations"""
22-04-2019T16:45:00,Nekonny,"Theres a use for them now that there wasn't really before, for me anyway"
22-04-2019T16:45:48,SkiddArt,Ah yeah.. live2d website shows that the pro version is a subscription based.. up to $18 a month
22-04-2019T16:45:57,SkiddArt,That's dumb
22-04-2019T16:46:30,Bgrmystr2,lol at least it's cheap compared to way more expensive stuff
22-04-2019T16:46:34,Bgrmystr2,like photoshop
22-04-2019T16:49:46,SkiddArt,cheap? I'd disagree.. At least if you pay for photoshop... it's done.. meanwhile if you want to continue use of this program it seems like you can't actually outright buy it.. you have to pay a subscription that never ends.
22-04-2019T16:49:46,Nekonny,whats the benifits of the pro version?
22-04-2019T16:50:04,SkiddArt,I don't really know.
22-04-2019T16:50:26,Bgrmystr2,I don't see how that's any different from Photoshop which is a more expensive subscription-based program
22-04-2019T16:50:29,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I have the difference if you want to see.
22-04-2019T16:50:37,Bgrmystr2,you can't buy out photoshop either from what I know
22-04-2019T16:51:07,SkiddArt,I use photoshop.. and never have to pay a subscription to activate the program and use it.
22-04-2019T16:51:21,SkiddArt,I OWN the program that I paid for.
22-04-2019T16:51:49,Bgrmystr2,"Photoshop is only available for $240 a year, you can't buy it outright if you wanted to get it now."
22-04-2019T16:51:56,Bgrmystr2,so.. expensive yes
22-04-2019T16:52:19,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"thats their new setup bgr, before you can just buy out right"
22-04-2019T16:52:41,SkiddArt,Hm... if that's a new photoshop thing.. that is also stupid..
22-04-2019T16:52:44,Bgrmystr2,didn't they change to subscription-based like years ago though?
22-04-2019T16:53:10,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I think when they brought out CC they did.
22-04-2019T16:53:21,SkiddArt,Oh man.. that's stupid.
22-04-2019T16:53:27,MarvTheHugPharaoh,agreed
22-04-2019T16:53:32,Bgrmystr2,yah
22-04-2019T16:53:43,SkiddArt,So yeah.. will not be using new photoshop or live 2d
22-04-2019T16:54:29,Nekonny,:(
22-04-2019T16:54:33,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Live2d gives you the option on start up if you want to use the free verion or not, no cahs needed to use"
22-04-2019T16:54:42,MarvTheHugPharaoh,cash*
22-04-2019T16:54:58,Nekonny,Although I don't use it myself
22-04-2019T16:55:02,Nekonny,I have tried it
22-04-2019T16:55:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I'm trying  it out right now
22-04-2019T16:55:27,PurpleLemons,Hello :wave:
22-04-2019T16:55:28,Nekonny,the cool thing about it is that it's more versatile than Emofuri
22-04-2019T16:55:35,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Purp <3
22-04-2019T16:55:35,Nekonny,but its a LOT more work
22-04-2019T16:55:55,Nekonny,I'm happy with the results I have been able to get out of emofuri
22-04-2019T16:56:05,Nekonny,so it works for my needs
22-04-2019T16:56:07,Nekonny,but
22-04-2019T16:56:32,Nekonny,"Live 2d has easier compatibly for games, apps, etc"
22-04-2019T16:57:09,Nekonny,so if you wanted to expand its use beyond just animating shotrt sequences;
22-04-2019T16:57:55,Nekonny,"actually, emofuri site says they also have compatibility, but the language barrier to understand it has been too much for me to even get a toehold"
22-04-2019T16:58:39,Nekonny,"Congrats btw, for getting in the cat book"
22-04-2019T16:58:50,BadFoMo,Cat book?
22-04-2019T16:58:51,Bgrmystr2,Toehold - When the generic foothold is just too difficult.
22-04-2019T16:59:18,Nekonny,Skidd knows what I mean XD
22-04-2019T16:59:44,BadFoMo,"Also, @Nekonny What's the music you're playing? I think I've heard it before."
22-04-2019T17:00:40,Nekonny,Empire Of The Sun - Walking On A Dream
22-04-2019T17:03:08,BadFoMo,"Thanks. It reminded me of a music video I saw on Atom Films years ago. I remember it had a robot on a space station, doing things for Humans that weren't there anymore."
22-04-2019T17:03:16,BadFoMo,*I
22-04-2019T17:03:34,BadFoMo,"Uh, sratch that *"
22-04-2019T17:04:31,Nekonny,interesting concept
22-04-2019T17:04:40,Nekonny,would like to see that
22-04-2019T17:05:19,Bgrmystr2,"there's a bunch of those on youtube, scifi shorts of things like that"
22-04-2019T17:05:37,Bgrmystr2,"CGBros has a bunch of stuff like that, there's a few others too"
22-04-2019T17:05:43,Bgrmystr2,Dust is a good channel as well
22-04-2019T17:05:59,Nekonny,DUST
22-04-2019T17:06:02,Nekonny,"oh yeh, them XD"
22-04-2019T17:06:11,Bgrmystr2,"I can't recall any of the others off the top my head, but there's 4 or 5 channels on youtube that host those kinds of shorts"

22-04-2019T20:19:30,SpazztasticKiwi,was spotted on the counter
22-04-2019T20:21:07,NibblyBot,New Comic Page: Family Meeting http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/1063/
22-04-2019T20:21:39,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-laugh: Pfff that 2nd panel
22-04-2019T20:22:13,Ordithus,:ptv-excited:
22-04-2019T20:22:19,Ordithus,Much hype
22-04-2019T20:22:24,Bgrmystr2,NOOO THE LAST PANEL IS TEXTLESS
22-04-2019T20:22:26,Ordithus,Very cute
22-04-2019T20:22:27,Ordithus,Wow
22-04-2019T20:22:36,Bgrmystr2,TOM You tease!
22-04-2019T20:22:57,Ordithus,"Pacing, Bgr, pacing"
22-04-2019T20:23:03,Ordithus,I like it
22-04-2019T20:23:10,Bgrmystr2,>.<
22-04-2019T20:24:13,RimaDraws,ikr!
22-04-2019T20:24:22,RimaDraws,urrrr
22-04-2019T20:29:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Rose breezing by Red is about the definition of ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not important‚Äù
22-04-2019T20:29:28,Ordithus,"Besides, no text bubbles to get in the way of how cute Raine is <3"
22-04-2019T20:30:06,SpazztasticKiwi,How hard would it be to take your girlfriend seriously if she got a tail
22-04-2019T20:30:14,Bgrmystr2,":newspaper: Textless page : What am I, chopped liver?"
22-04-2019T20:30:28,Bgrmystr2,"that's what we have the textless for, Ord xD"
22-04-2019T20:30:35,Bgrmystr2,"besides, text wouldn't get in the way it'd be in the middle"
22-04-2019T20:31:20,Bgrmystr2,it wouldn't be hard at all. Just cuz she has a tail doesn't have any relevance to the legitimacy of her statements lol
22-04-2019T20:31:34,Ordithus,"We usually have walls of text anyways, so a welcome change in my view"
22-04-2019T20:31:41,Bgrmystr2,they are equally as legitimate as they were before the tail :u
22-04-2019T20:32:07,Bgrmystr2,I was expecting loreeeee
22-04-2019T20:32:17,Bgrmystr2,I get nothing good day sir. :ptv-sad:
22-04-2019T20:32:46,Ordithus,Lore next page
22-04-2019T20:32:52,Ordithus,"We got lore, anyways"
22-04-2019T20:32:57,Ordithus,What are you complaining about
22-04-2019T20:33:01,RimaDraws,i like that rose and raine are making contact finally <3 . <3
22-04-2019T20:33:13,RimaDraws,i have no complaints
22-04-2019T20:33:17,Bgrmystr2,xD did we really though?
22-04-2019T20:33:20,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-rose::ctwokinds-RaineEep:
22-04-2019T20:33:28,Ordithus,Red and Trace lore
22-04-2019T20:33:33,Bgrmystr2,we knew that though
22-04-2019T20:33:40,Bgrmystr2,nothing that was said we didn't already know
22-04-2019T20:34:33,Bgrmystr2,"and I'm not complaining, but if I were, you can't ask that question Ord, cuz you know exactly what I was talkin about anyway :P"
22-04-2019T20:34:55,Ordithus,"I do, but I find your complaining entertaining"
22-04-2019T20:35:15,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-reniderp:*[Neeeerd!]
22-04-2019T20:35:20,Bgrmystr2,"xD it's not complaining though, as much as you claim it as such."
22-04-2019T20:36:04,Bgrmystr2,"I didn't ask for a refund, did I? :ptv-snicker:"
22-04-2019T20:37:21,Ordithus,Here's a refund anyways
22-04-2019T20:37:26,Ordithus,*dust*
22-04-2019T20:37:35,Bgrmystr2,"good, cuz I didn't want one anyway"
22-04-2019T20:40:28,Ordithus,well fine
22-04-2019T20:40:48,Bgrmystr2,"I'll keep the new page, thanks."
22-04-2019T20:44:09,RimaDraws,lol
22-04-2019T21:57:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera is asleep and also slowly falling off the bed
22-04-2019T22:29:03,CrRAR,That is a mentally amusing image.
22-04-2019T22:29:21,CrRAR,My imagination thanks you~
22-04-2019T22:29:37,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-daydreamingkat::ctwokinds-katdryer:
22-04-2019T22:30:36,CrRAR,"Cat physix dictates he will fall off, yet land gracefully on his feet like nothing happened."
22-04-2019T22:33:14,Bgrmystr2,"there's also a 10% chance that he will proceed to spaz IMMEDIATELY upon falling off, in which case it will leap off sideways off the bed, into the wall, slide to the floor, and then proceed to bolt at maximum speed into the hallway beyond."
22-04-2019T22:35:45,CrRAR,xD
22-04-2019T22:36:03,CrRAR,:zap:
22-04-2019T22:36:16,Ordithus,just like he meant it
22-04-2019T22:36:40,CrRAR,*ptchuuuu~*
22-04-2019T22:36:40,Bgrmystr2,I definitely have not seen videos of cats doing exactly that. Definitely not. :thinking:
22-04-2019T22:36:48,Bgrmystr2,not specific at all.
22-04-2019T22:41:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh and I noticed Red has a few twiggy strands of a mini beard
22-04-2019T22:43:39,SpazztasticKiwi,"You‚Äôre close. He awoke, eyes wide open, when his rear hit the point of no return in terms of falling"
22-04-2019T22:44:26,SpazztasticKiwi,And he clawed the bedside as gravity tried to take him down and I only sat there and laughed
22-04-2019T22:44:58,Bgrmystr2,did he fall to the floor and bolt out the room?
22-04-2019T22:49:54,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
22-04-2019T22:50:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Nope. Pulled his way up and repositioned into a curled fluffy doughnut like nothing happened
22-04-2019T22:50:41,Bgrmystr2,"oh, he saved it"
22-04-2019T22:50:43,Bgrmystr2,nice
22-04-2019T22:51:20,Bgrmystr2,have you tried slowly pulling the blanket they're laying on till they're bout to fall off?
22-04-2019T22:51:22,Bgrmystr2,then see what they do?
22-04-2019T23:00:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve done something like that before. He woke up with annoyed in his eyes
22-04-2019T23:10:46,Bgrmystr2,haha aw
22-04-2019T23:11:00,Bgrmystr2,as expected really
22-04-2019T23:18:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Picarto just shat its connection for a solid 5 minutes there
