28-03-2019T19:57:33,LannAF,or your back is already fucked
28-03-2019T19:57:55,Bgrmystr2,"hard to say if it's just from moving stuff or if it's partially from my scoliosis, but it's not likely since it's not even remotely bad"

28-03-2019T20:23:48,Bgrmystr2,the ryzen series comes with fans that are good enough to overclock a little bit
28-03-2019T20:23:54,SageSaga,the only thing better than my cpu cooler is liquid cooling

28-03-2019T21:55:59,LannAF,I say as I cry from fatigue and bruising
28-03-2019T21:56:03,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:blush:
28-03-2019T21:56:15,TheBeckoner,You see normally the weekend is my break but Im stupid and have chem class tomorrow
28-03-2019T21:56:16,MuonNeutrino,"i should go back in time and take the 3rd piece of pizza from past me and give it to marv, it was too much in hindsight XD"
28-03-2019T21:56:20,Twokinds,Man it did it again
28-03-2019T21:56:25,Twokinds,Something's really wrong
28-03-2019T21:56:27,Bgrmystr2,I'm okay..ish.. bar back pain. And burn pain from sage. But the latter hurts the worst.
28-03-2019T21:56:29,SageSaga,what's the error?
28-03-2019T21:56:33,Bgrmystr2,Aw tom :(
28-03-2019T21:56:35,Twokinds,It freezes
28-03-2019T21:56:42,NezumiYuki,Dang!
28-03-2019T21:56:52,Masterzooka,"heh, welcome to my world."
28-03-2019T21:56:53,MarvTheHugPharaoh,is there a background thing freaking it out?
28-03-2019T21:56:53,unsteddyphoenix,Photoshop does? Hm.
28-03-2019T21:57:11,NuclearMcGinnis,What froze?
28-03-2019T21:57:11,unsteddyphoenix,Guess its time to switch back to cs5 /s
28-03-2019T21:57:14,Twokinds,Everything else works fine
28-03-2019T21:57:36,SageSaga,it freezes randomly or during certain actions like saving?
28-03-2019T21:57:45,Twokinds,Whenever I use a large brush
28-03-2019T21:57:55,RimaDraws,home
28-03-2019T21:57:57,MuonNeutrino,hmmm
28-03-2019T21:57:59,SageSaga,ok let's see what we can find
28-03-2019T21:58:03,unsteddyphoenix,Thats extremely odd
28-03-2019T21:58:05,MarvTheHugPharaoh,welcome home Rime
28-03-2019T21:58:06,unsteddyphoenix,yo Rima
28-03-2019T21:58:09,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Rima
28-03-2019T21:58:18,Bgrmystr2,Hey Rima
28-03-2019T21:58:24,RimaDraws,heyo
28-03-2019T21:58:34,NezumiYuki,Ohhhh pardon my ignorance Tom?  I had no idea PS was wigging out on you when saving.  I wouldn't have said save nao otherwise!
28-03-2019T21:58:55,Masterzooka,maybe it’s the process of many pixels being painted at the same time or something?
28-03-2019T21:59:24,MuonNeutrino,"well, a large brush is when it is doing the most operations at once, i'd think...."
28-03-2019T21:59:29,NuclearMcGinnis,There it goes again.
28-03-2019T21:59:30,MuonNeutrino,graphics card?
28-03-2019T21:59:31,MuonNeutrino,i dunno
28-03-2019T21:59:41,Twokinds,Running tests
28-03-2019T21:59:56,NuclearMcGinnis,Ohhh i thought it crashed again.
28-03-2019T21:59:58,SageSaga,Tom - Try this- dont use your cintiq for the brush- try with the mouse
28-03-2019T22:00:00,Masterzooka,when did this start?
28-03-2019T22:00:16,MuonNeutrino,"that would isolate one possible cause, for sure"
28-03-2019T22:00:22,Masterzooka,oh no not the mouse
28-03-2019T22:00:26,unsteddyphoenix,Ah we're googling the same thing Sage lol\
28-03-2019T22:00:45,SageSaga,lots of things to test for- that one stood out as interesting
28-03-2019T22:00:53,SageSaga,its something i wouldnt normally test
28-03-2019T22:00:54,happyguyone,aww that image on twokinds stream is so cute
28-03-2019T22:00:58,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah, and its nice and easy"
28-03-2019T22:01:02,unsteddyphoenix,IT IS THOUGH
28-03-2019T22:01:40,fanir,i'm guessing it's a bad ram stick or bad graphics card memory
28-03-2019T22:01:57,Bgrmystr2,"All his hardware is new, bro"
28-03-2019T22:02:00,MuonNeutrino,"possible, it might not show up unless you do something that stresses the computer more"
28-03-2019T22:02:02,Bgrmystr2,literally brand new
28-03-2019T22:02:06,SageSaga,Bgr- new doesnt mean without faults
28-03-2019T22:02:11,MuonNeutrino,@Bgrmystr2 doesn't mean something couldn't be defective
28-03-2019T22:02:11,SageSaga,you can have issues with new hardware
28-03-2019T22:02:19,Bgrmystr2,yeah but the likelyhood of new stuff having issues vs old stuff
28-03-2019T22:02:22,Bgrmystr2,is much lower
28-03-2019T22:02:23,unsteddyphoenix,Is your tablet driver updated?
28-03-2019T22:02:39,MuonNeutrino,"bad graphics card memory could be a thing, drawing with a large brush is when it would be more likely to kick in hardware acceleration and start using the graphics card"
28-03-2019T22:02:49,Masterzooka,@SageSaga tell me about it lol
28-03-2019T22:02:54,SageSaga,Bgr- if its a problem with a new system that he didnt have with an old system - then the likelyhood is different
28-03-2019T22:03:09,Masterzooka,oh cool its back
28-03-2019T22:03:32,MuonNeutrino,"@Bgrmystr2 if a new thing doesn't have a problem, then yeah the chance of it subsequently developing a problem is lower than an old thing, but if a new thing *comes* with a problem, that's different"
28-03-2019T22:03:50,Bgrmystr2,"I don't think so, cuz that's kind of besides the point"
28-03-2019T22:04:06,Bgrmystr2,"of course something with a problem will cause problems, but that's silly to even bring up xD"
28-03-2019T22:04:08,fanir,"or a bad connection, maybe again ram or graphics card. bad connections can create weird issues..."
28-03-2019T22:04:17,MuonNeutrino,the point was it being new doesn't mean it can't have a problem =P
28-03-2019T22:04:22,Masterzooka,oh no its stopped again
28-03-2019T22:04:48,FloofyCat,"Tom, if it's bad you could try rolling back the Cintiq drivers, that helped me with some Wacom weirdness before."
28-03-2019T22:04:50,Bgrmystr2,I've been through new stuff having problems I know full well
28-03-2019T22:04:55,SageSaga,im not sure if Tom has his Photoshop setup to use his graphics card- isnt there an option for GPU acceleration in Photoshop or is that standard now?
28-03-2019T22:04:58,Masterzooka,welp that’s wierd timing.
28-03-2019T22:05:26,Masterzooka,macom wierdness. that’s brilliant.
28-03-2019T22:05:27,FloofyCat,"*Shrugs* It ain't going to be something with RAM/GPU because if it is, you'd see much more bigger issues lol."
28-03-2019T22:05:33,RimaDraws,this page looks good
28-03-2019T22:05:36,Bgrmystr2,"and ya missed mine muon, cuz your point is not lookiin at the whole picture anyway"
28-03-2019T22:05:45,Bgrmystr2,yeah it does Rima
28-03-2019T22:05:55,SageSaga,Floofy- when you use a really large brush it uses a lot more RAM
28-03-2019T22:05:56,NezumiYuki,"Not sure Sage. I'm only using the old OLD legacy photoshop, so that thing about using GPU gets a shrug from me."
28-03-2019T22:06:12,unsteddyphoenix,90% either some photoshop setting or tablet driver
28-03-2019T22:06:37,NuclearMcGinnis,Yo... Who made this music? I Wanna look them up later
28-03-2019T22:06:39,Masterzooka,"Okay, to hell with the lowercase."
28-03-2019T22:06:41,MuonNeutrino,also i saw something on google about using a really large brush also being when it kicks in the graphics card hardware acceleration
28-03-2019T22:06:48,MuonNeutrino,so v0v
28-03-2019T22:06:49,FloofyCat,It shouldn't use enough to cause issues unless ya' got like 8GB of RAM and like 100 google chrome tabs and other stuff.
28-03-2019T22:07:21,Masterzooka,"Ooh, this is nice music right ‘ere."
28-03-2019T22:07:26,SageSaga,Floofy- if it hits a bad ram stick it doesnt matter
28-03-2019T22:07:41,Masterzooka,Anyone gonna do Nibbly dance?
28-03-2019T22:07:50,unsteddyphoenix,He has 64gb of ram lol
28-03-2019T22:08:03,Masterzooka,"Oh my god, that’s a lot."
28-03-2019T22:08:03,SageSaga,I know I helped him put the build together
28-03-2019T22:08:16,NezumiYuki,"Nibbly can't dance right now... I""m busy hugging her! ;P"
28-03-2019T22:08:41,unsteddyphoenix,Yes thats why I was telling floofy not you sage :)
28-03-2019T22:09:23,Masterzooka,*Terrified squeaking*
28-03-2019T22:09:35,NezumiYuki,What's wrong Zooka?
28-03-2019T22:09:45,Masterzooka,Oh boy...
28-03-2019T22:09:55,Masterzooka,The thing stopped again.
28-03-2019T22:10:06,NezumiYuki,. . . oh  =(
28-03-2019T22:10:20,fanir,"floofy, the problem might not be the amount of ram, but a very small area somewhere in between which might be bad. same for the graphics memory"
28-03-2019T22:10:31,NuclearMcGinnis,"Dang, this thing just does not like you, Tom."
28-03-2019T22:10:49,Twokinds,?
28-03-2019T22:10:49,SageSaga,really helpful McGinnis
28-03-2019T22:10:54,Twokinds,No it's still fine
28-03-2019T22:11:00,Masterzooka,Just how long has it done this for???
28-03-2019T22:11:28,fanir,"but really it could just be anything. driver, weird bug in photoshop(?), ..."
28-03-2019T22:11:37,FloofyCat,It's either going to be like one contact is intermittently touching and just needs a few prods to be seated properly or a driver issue with communicating with RAM
28-03-2019T22:11:42,Masterzooka,Eyy it’s back
28-03-2019T22:11:55,SageSaga,it never went away
28-03-2019T22:12:02,NezumiYuki,Only being half sarcastic~  Photoshop is ALL bug.  :P
28-03-2019T22:12:03,NuclearMcGinnis,Oh.
28-03-2019T22:12:04,Masterzooka,"(I swear, if I jinx it...)"
28-03-2019T22:12:08,fanir,hehe
28-03-2019T22:12:08,Twokinds,I changed some photoshop settings
28-03-2019T22:12:20,unsteddyphoenix,Welcome back Tom! :D
28-03-2019T22:12:22,Twokinds,"So far it hasn't crashed again, we'll see"
28-03-2019T22:12:31,NezumiYuki,crosses fingers for Tom
28-03-2019T22:12:35,fanir,that's good so far
28-03-2019T22:12:48,Masterzooka,🤞🤞🤞
28-03-2019T22:14:59,NezumiYuki,runs off for a sammich~
28-03-2019T22:15:20,FloofyCat,If we're betting I'm gunna say drivers/settings issue
28-03-2019T22:15:20,ZoopBoopLoop,Remember to save
28-03-2019T22:15:30,Masterzooka,“Sandvish make me strong.”
28-03-2019T22:15:36,RimaDraws,mhm
28-03-2019T22:15:44,Masterzooka,*Sandvich whoops
28-03-2019T22:16:06,FloofyCat,What's this song? I keep hearing it but can't remember what it is
28-03-2019T22:16:29,FloofyCat,It's pretty cool
28-03-2019T22:16:59,Twokinds,Galexica
28-03-2019T22:17:04,Twokinds,Panda Eye
28-03-2019T22:17:09,FloofyCat,Thanks \o/
28-03-2019T22:17:41,SageSaga,i was gonna buy some new music but i lack the funds
28-03-2019T22:17:59,Combak,Youtube man!
28-03-2019T22:18:17,Masterzooka,???
28-03-2019T22:18:27,SageSaga,who is youtube man?
28-03-2019T22:18:31,FloofyCat,Can you use any music?
28-03-2019T22:18:34,Masterzooka,I feel like I’m missing a joke.
28-03-2019T22:18:42,FloofyCat,Think he means just downloading music from YR
28-03-2019T22:18:43,FloofyCat,YT*
28-03-2019T22:18:53,Bgrmystr2,or just playing music from youtube
28-03-2019T22:19:04,SageSaga,i dont have youtube music
28-03-2019T22:19:24,Combak,And?
28-03-2019T22:19:32,FloofyCat,Nah I think he means just downloading a video not like the actual service
28-03-2019T22:19:36,SageSaga,and I pay for my music?
28-03-2019T22:19:41,FloofyCat,Also the perspective tool looks tricky
28-03-2019T22:19:47,Masterzooka,"Golly, that grid’s a pretty good timesaver!"
28-03-2019T22:20:37,FloofyCat,"Hey I ain't saying buy or don't buy, just trying to make what the guy said clear. Personally I'd buy if I get a file that isn't compressed to hell"
28-03-2019T22:20:49,FloofyCat,Nowadays you just get mp3s for buying it and spleh
28-03-2019T22:21:43,Masterzooka,"Oh, god."
28-03-2019T22:22:02,FloofyCat,*Insert raving nibbly*
28-03-2019T22:22:02,totallynotTrace,i dont have a dac that is particularly good so it makes no dif if i have super high fidelity or standard mp3. wish it was that good tho
28-03-2019T22:22:06,Masterzooka,"Yay, the loading cursor spared you this time!"
28-03-2019T22:22:26,SageSaga,i haz a DAC
28-03-2019T22:22:29,Masterzooka,"@FloofyCat Do it, yes!,!"
28-03-2019T22:22:31,FloofyCat,I got a commercial sound card and a decent enough headset so I can hear the difference between MP3s and not
28-03-2019T22:22:55,SageSaga,i have a very nice headset
28-03-2019T22:22:59,Masterzooka,"Ah, the keyboard flick thing didn’t work. Again."
28-03-2019T22:23:01,ArkanaCat,poor raine
28-03-2019T22:23:04,totallynotTrace,i get constant static even with the sound all the way down
28-03-2019T22:23:58,Masterzooka,"@SageSaga I have this really good noise cancelling headset. It’s by good old Sony, and apparently it’s the best in Australia."
28-03-2019T22:23:59,FloofyCat,"Hey Sage, you should try running 4K blu rays through your DAC, or most Blu-Rays really"
28-03-2019T22:24:05,FloofyCat,The audio that comes with them is amazing
28-03-2019T22:24:16,Masterzooka,"I have misophonia, so the headset is extremely useful."
28-03-2019T22:24:48,FloofyCat,"TotallynotTrace, might need a new 3.5mm cable or to try plugging it into a new port"
28-03-2019T22:25:03,SageSaga,my headset is basically a sennheiser 650
28-03-2019T22:25:16,totallynotTrace,nope its a turtle beach so it has a inline dac
28-03-2019T22:25:17,Masterzooka,"Oh, nice!"
28-03-2019T22:25:37,Masterzooka,(I don’t actually know what that is I’m not smart)
28-03-2019T22:25:38,FloofyCat,"Mine ain't, I'm too poor to drop on that"
28-03-2019T22:25:42,FloofyCat,I really wanna though.
28-03-2019T22:26:13,FloofyCat,But what I got atm is good enough so unless there's like some flash 50% off I probably won't upgrade
28-03-2019T22:26:20,SageSaga,the Massdrop sennheiser 6xx HD is a 650 for like less than half the price
28-03-2019T22:27:04,FloofyCat,Damnit
28-03-2019T22:27:13,Masterzooka,Here’s the headphones I got. https://store.sony.com.au/headphones-noisecancelling/WH1000XM3S.html
28-03-2019T22:27:15,FloofyCat,Now I wanna get it but I don't have the money
28-03-2019T22:27:19,Masterzooka,I got the grey.
28-03-2019T22:28:01,RandomPictures,Meanwhile.. I'm just using earphone : I
28-03-2019T22:28:02,SageSaga,ive seen those - they are supposed to be really good- however
28-03-2019T22:28:16,Bgrmystr2,$500 jesus fuck
28-03-2019T22:28:19,Bgrmystr2,why
28-03-2019T22:28:20,SageSaga,most audiophiles say to not use noise cancelling for listening :P
28-03-2019T22:28:24,MuonNeutrino,yow that's a lotta money
28-03-2019T22:28:25,Masterzooka,@RandomPictures Lol.
28-03-2019T22:28:26,FloofyCat,Why so?
28-03-2019T22:28:41,SageSaga,noise cancelling has to destroy some sound to be noise cancelling
28-03-2019T22:28:52,MuonNeutrino,true
28-03-2019T22:28:57,MuonNeutrino,never thought of it that way
28-03-2019T22:29:10,SageSaga,that said- Noise cancelling is great for day to day
28-03-2019T22:29:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,love  Noise cancelling
28-03-2019T22:29:27,SageSaga,and if you have a noisy environment like a busy house hold
28-03-2019T22:29:36,FloofyCat,my GTX 970 fan noise is so damn loud that noise cancelling kinda helps
28-03-2019T22:29:41,FloofyCat,And it definitely is noisy here
28-03-2019T22:29:49,Bgrmystr2,I have a busy household with ppl who play music way louder than they should cuz old.. and I can't hear it over the music I play
28-03-2019T22:29:55,MarvTheHugPharaoh,your 970 fans should only spin under load
28-03-2019T22:29:55,Bgrmystr2,so I don't get the noise canceling thing
28-03-2019T22:29:56,Masterzooka,I got noise cancelling because misophonia is a thing
28-03-2019T22:29:57,SageSaga,or going on plane trip - put those on- and you dont have to hear anyone
28-03-2019T22:30:00,FloofyCat,Tom can attest if he had what looked like an EVGA 970 at 100% fan speed
28-03-2019T22:30:11,Masterzooka,"And trust me, misophonia is the devil himself."
28-03-2019T22:30:11,FloofyCat,Marv I usually set them to 100% for certain games
28-03-2019T22:30:38,Masterzooka,I don’t have to hear mouth sounds!
28-03-2019T22:30:58,Bgrmystr2,Wtf game are you playing to need 100% fan speed on a 970
28-03-2019T22:31:08,SageSaga,most games today
28-03-2019T22:31:19,ZRO4825,:thinking:
28-03-2019T22:31:27,Bgrmystr2,running 4k at like 120hz? lol
28-03-2019T22:31:35,Bgrmystr2,I'd understand that xD
28-03-2019T22:31:39,ZRO4825,"I'm running a 970, it doesn't seem to have too much trouble at all o_O"
28-03-2019T22:31:52,SageSaga,can a 970 run anything at 4k?
28-03-2019T22:31:58,MarvTheHugPharaoh,yes
28-03-2019T22:32:07,SageSaga,solitaire- right
28-03-2019T22:32:09,NezumiYuki,"Subnautica, Dayz, PubG, those use a lot of GPU from what I've heard...  also back with sammiches yay!"
28-03-2019T22:32:09,FloofyCat,"Yeah if you were in the heat wave last year and you have a room with poor (if any) circulation and there's no wind, you'll need 100% fan speed to stay under 40c whilst under load..."
28-03-2019T22:32:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I played modded skyrim at 4k
28-03-2019T22:32:32,FloofyCat,"And nah all I can get away with is 2K on this, unless it's a real old game, even that is stressful for it."
28-03-2019T22:32:36,totallynotTrace,omg Subnautica is unoptimizable
28-03-2019T22:32:38,ZRO4825,"I don't bother with 4k. No real use. Then again I also have a 9 year old monitor, so there's that too."
28-03-2019T22:32:47,Bgrmystr2,"fairly sure the 970 can run lots of stuff at 4k, considering my 760 is capable of 2550x1600 at 60fps"
28-03-2019T22:32:48,FloofyCat,4k is great... for movies.
28-03-2019T22:33:00,Bgrmystr2,"there's no reason a card that's what, twice the power of mine?"
28-03-2019T22:33:06,Bgrmystr2,can't run 4k
28-03-2019T22:33:23,FloofyCat,Bgr 4k it's more that you need to push out more pixels
28-03-2019T22:33:30,totallynotTrace,"what i mean is they used the engine as a proof of concept that they planned on dropping, but then people demanded more so they had to stick with a ineficient engine for what they were doing"
28-03-2019T22:33:31,SageSaga,what quality are you running to get 4k 60FPS at 1600?
28-03-2019T22:33:33,Bgrmystr2,"I know what 4k is, Floofy"
28-03-2019T22:33:42,NezumiYuki,I'll say it again... Halfling Raine is too cute! <3
28-03-2019T22:33:54,FloofyCat,8847360 pixels vs 2073600 pixels
28-03-2019T22:33:56,SageSaga,*didnt mean to say 4k
28-03-2019T22:34:25,Masterzooka,Raine is always cute.
28-03-2019T22:34:31,SageSaga,Nezumi she is way too tall to be a halfling
28-03-2019T22:34:35,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:cmarvthehugpharaoh-ezgifcom-crop6: best girl
28-03-2019T22:34:40,FloofyCat,Raine is gunna yeet on Trace.
28-03-2019T22:34:52,Bgrmystr2,"lolo, I don't actually recall, but at least medium high from when I was doing research on the gpu I bought to see the power of it"
28-03-2019T22:35:01,Masterzooka,In at least 28 ways.
28-03-2019T22:35:17,FloofyCat,She gunna give Trace a magical boop from across the continent
28-03-2019T22:35:20,Masterzooka,"Heh, 28 WAYS."
28-03-2019T22:35:33,Bgrmystr2,might have been slightly overclocked above the base OC though
28-03-2019T22:35:35,Masterzooka,DIDNT WANNA LEAVE HIM A CHANCE HUH
28-03-2019T22:35:42,FloofyCat,4k for games is pretty meh though
28-03-2019T22:35:43,CharlieFoxtrot,Waifu stream?
28-03-2019T22:35:52,Masterzooka,"-Connor, best android."
28-03-2019T22:36:10,FloofyCat,Kinda need the games themselves to have textures that are drawn well in 4k in the first place.
28-03-2019T22:36:19,Masterzooka,Magic boop heh
28-03-2019T22:36:28,Masterzooka,That’s brilliant.
28-03-2019T22:36:28,SageSaga,from my research to get 60+ FPS at 4k you need a 1080 minimum and for most games you need a 1080TI to stay at 60
28-03-2019T22:37:11,FloofyCat,1080 does 40-50 at most recent games at 4k ultra settings at 60fps
28-03-2019T22:37:27,FloofyCat,It's usually 60+ fps and stable at medium to high settings
28-03-2019T22:38:06,FloofyCat,You can still kinda get Ultra at 55-60 fps if you start turning some big monchy stuff down like dynamic lights
28-03-2019T22:38:20,FloofyCat,"But yeah, tbh, 4k for gaming isn't worth it, 4k for movies is another story."
28-03-2019T22:38:40,Masterzooka,"...how do you memorise these things, flood?"
28-03-2019T22:38:47,Masterzooka,*floof
28-03-2019T22:38:54,FloofyCat,Unhealthy Linus Tech Tips binging
28-03-2019T22:39:07,totallynotTrace,LTT for life
28-03-2019T22:39:17,SageSaga,2k gaming makes more sense imo - 4k up close on a screen that isnt over 40inches- doesnt make sense
28-03-2019T22:39:19,FloofyCat,Although by 'recent games' I mean BF1 and not BF:V
28-03-2019T22:39:23,Masterzooka,(Gotta love autocorrect am I right
28-03-2019T22:39:32,FloofyCat,"Oh yeah, resolution only really goes so far."
28-03-2019T22:39:44,Masterzooka,Tom is that blood
28-03-2019T22:39:57,Masterzooka,Did she kill someone.
28-03-2019T22:39:59,Masterzooka,"Again,"
28-03-2019T22:40:01,SageSaga,why would you think that was blood-
28-03-2019T22:40:14,Masterzooka,"Raine, what have I told you about killing people?"
28-03-2019T22:40:31,Masterzooka,"Calm down, joking"
28-03-2019T22:40:37,FloofyCat,Considering that something like HTTYD 2 or 3 would be taking a few hours per frame for your IMAX Laser screening and your card has under a 60th of a second
28-03-2019T22:40:46,totallynotTrace,"well it does look like blood gushing out spontainiously, although she didnt do it as its yet to pool"
28-03-2019T22:40:57,MuonNeutrino,it looks like a shredded cloth hanging
28-03-2019T22:41:05,Combak,...It's curtain or something.
28-03-2019T22:41:10,totallynotTrace,so.... i guess the Doom Guy is in house
28-03-2019T22:41:13,Bgrmystr2,There's a page I have here that they did 4k on the 970 :o
28-03-2019T22:41:30,FloofyCat,If you can overclock and overvolt it then 4k is possible
28-03-2019T22:41:57,FloofyCat,I wouldn't be surprised if someone managed to shunt some of the workload onto an iGPU or something weird
28-03-2019T22:42:02,Masterzooka,"Brb you are spared from my social awkwardness for now, mortals."
28-03-2019T22:42:19,FloofyCat,"I know someone had a 2080 or 2070 or something, then had a 1080 dedicated to one thing"
28-03-2019T22:42:33,FloofyCat,I hope that's a bucket of red paint
28-03-2019T22:42:42,Bgrmystr2,"doesn't say anything about overvolting, so probably not, Floofy"
28-03-2019T22:42:55,MuonNeutrino,hm. do i sense a bit of frustration on raine's part about transforming again? heh
28-03-2019T22:43:00,FloofyCat,You definitely can get stuff like TF2 at 4K
28-03-2019T22:43:39,FloofyCat,I still hope that's red paint and not a murder spree on all of our waifus
28-03-2019T22:43:48,Redwolf150,@twokinds is she slowly transforming?
28-03-2019T22:44:08,Bgrmystr2,"Try Crysis, Batman Arkham Knight, Forza Horizon 3, and Forza Motorsport 6 Apex"
28-03-2019T22:44:12,Bgrmystr2,not just TF2
28-03-2019T22:44:24,MuonNeutrino,i assume we won't know exactly what's up until he posts the completed page with dialog
28-03-2019T22:44:26,Bgrmystr2,4k on a 970 lol
28-03-2019T22:44:34,NezumiYuki,@Floofy... Looks like a torn red curtain to me. Not so much blud and gorerrrrrrrrr  LOL
28-03-2019T22:44:55,MuonNeutrino,we
28-03-2019T22:44:56,FloofyCat,Oh... actually yeah that does look fabricy at the top
28-03-2019T22:45:02,MuonNeutrino,*we're just going to have to be patient
28-03-2019T22:46:47,totallynotTrace,has anyone ever sent a message and then it just *poof* dissapears and doesnt leave evidence of it ever making it to chat?
28-03-2019T22:47:00,FloofyCat,"That looks pretty good Bgr, had no idea"
28-03-2019T22:47:05,totallynotTrace,cuz that just happened
28-03-2019T22:47:07,FloofyCat,Whoo not blood confirmed
28-03-2019T22:47:13,Masterzooka,"Welp, gtg permanently since life happened."
28-03-2019T22:47:14,MuonNeutrino,"only a couple times, always when my internet's been messing up"
28-03-2019T22:47:16,Masterzooka,Bye.
28-03-2019T22:47:18,Bgrmystr2,"yeh nottrace, happens every so often"
28-03-2019T22:47:23,FloofyCat,"Awh, bye :c"
28-03-2019T22:47:27,Bgrmystr2,bad connectivity methinks
28-03-2019T22:47:30,NezumiYuki,Take care Zooka
28-03-2019T22:47:35,Bgrmystr2,seeya zooka
28-03-2019T22:47:40,NuclearMcGinnis,Its happened to me once during this stream.
28-03-2019T22:50:44,FloofyCat,I wanna make pizza and don't want the dough to go to waste but I wanna watch the stream
28-03-2019T22:50:51,FloofyCat,I dunno which
28-03-2019T22:51:07,RandomPictures,Both
28-03-2019T22:51:16,NezumiYuki,Both is good!
28-03-2019T22:51:20,NezumiYuki,also
28-03-2019T22:51:21,MuonNeutrino,"set up your desktop above the counter so you can watch while making pizza, of course =P"
28-03-2019T22:51:22,NuclearMcGinnis,Yes both.
28-03-2019T22:51:29,NezumiYuki,"I wish picarto would let viewers with a two or three window multi stream reconfigure them on your desktop however you wanted... Or at the very least, put a two person multi-stream stacked vertically and not horizontal like this..."
28-03-2019T22:51:40,FloofyCat,No ethernet in the kitchen >_<
28-03-2019T22:52:02,RandomPictures,Use phone
28-03-2019T22:52:08,FloofyCat,Oh that's a good ideea
28-03-2019T22:52:10,MuonNeutrino,well then you need to run out really quick and buy a really long eithernet cable ^^
28-03-2019T22:52:10,FloofyCat,idea*
28-03-2019T22:52:17,Mihari,"Open the stream in multiple windows, stretch each window to fit the screen, put on different monitors"
28-03-2019T22:52:17,NezumiYuki,Having to expand and contract different streamers gets a bit annoying... picarto.
28-03-2019T22:52:17,Bgrmystr2,"lol, they're configured based on what page you go to, Nezumi"
28-03-2019T22:52:35,NuclearMcGinnis,Prop your phone up somewhere near the stove.
28-03-2019T22:52:36,totallynotTrace,just open 3 windows of your internet browse and viola
28-03-2019T22:52:39,NezumiYuki,hmmm ponders Mihari's suggestion*
28-03-2019T22:52:53,NezumiYuki,Also welcome aboard Speed Kitty!  :D
28-03-2019T22:52:57,totallynotTrace,also say goodbye to your RAM if you dont have a lot
28-03-2019T22:53:12,Mihari,Don't have that problem.
28-03-2019T22:53:18,Bgrmystr2,"as long as your browser doesn't have a ram leak, it'd be fine"
28-03-2019T22:54:18,totallynotTrace,what if your low on ram before opening a browser XD
28-03-2019T22:54:41,Bgrmystr2,it uses less than 1.5gb of ram for either of my browsers
28-03-2019T22:55:04,Bgrmystr2,"so if you have low ram, you done did somethin you shouldn'ta."
28-03-2019T22:55:12,RandomPictures,I wish I  could stay more to watch the stream but my internet data is almost out..
28-03-2019T22:55:17,RandomPictures,Welp cya
28-03-2019T22:55:23,NuclearMcGinnis,Awe nooo....

28-03-2019T23:10:07,NezumiYuki,I'd think OG Halo?
28-03-2019T23:10:42,IceMagic,Is there a way to create the Halo theme with brail on a computer?
28-03-2019T23:10:49,Tenux,"No, hallo"

28-03-2019T23:17:13,IceMagic,"Doing fairly well, how about you?"
28-03-2019T23:17:15,NezumiYuki,"welp... so much for having two windows open..  It was smooth enough, but I can't make three browser windows for picarto and expect zero chop... sigh"
28-03-2019T23:17:38,Peachyu,im great!
28-03-2019T23:17:47,Tenux,Good
28-03-2019T23:18:04,NezumiYuki,"Good to hear, Peachyu!  :D"
28-03-2019T23:18:10,NezumiYuki,woo a bit of chat lag there
28-03-2019T23:18:59,IceMagic,Surprised I'm not experiencing any lag. I've got 3 streams and some youtube all happening.
28-03-2019T23:20:16,Bgrmystr2,nezumi do you not see all 3 streams in one browser window?
28-03-2019T23:21:23,NezumiYuki,"@bgr~   Now I do, on accout that I could at least enjoy two windows for Sage and Tom, but now with Peaches joined in, I have to go back to a single windoid"
28-03-2019T23:22:34,Bgrmystr2,get four displays
28-03-2019T23:22:39,Bgrmystr2,then have no problems ever never :D
28-03-2019T23:22:42,NezumiYuki,I wish!  xD
28-03-2019T23:22:50,Bgrmystr2,"Hey, I have four displays right now"
28-03-2019T23:22:54,Bgrmystr2,don't knock it :V
28-03-2019T23:23:13,Bgrmystr2,always possible.
28-03-2019T23:23:16,NezumiYuki,"No no not knocking it, I think that's great!  I wish I could have multi-mons!"
28-03-2019T23:23:35,NezumiYuki,This basic rig I have only has one monitor out
28-03-2019T23:23:38,Bgrmystr2,"you can, like that unmentioned guy said, just DO it :v"
28-03-2019T23:23:46,Lucain,Evening lol
