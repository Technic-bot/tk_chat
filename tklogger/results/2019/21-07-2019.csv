21-07-2019T11:38:46,Orthonox,@AspiringNoodle What are you talking about? Keiren is wearing armor. It's called plot armor. Much more effective than say StormTrooper armor.
21-07-2019T12:18:36,AspiringNoodle,Ha

21-07-2019T14:05:23,CrimsonQuill,It never works out too well.

21-07-2019T14:06:13,Yevni,I just sleep for 18 hours after staying up that late
