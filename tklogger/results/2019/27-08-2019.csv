27-08-2019T16:36:58,RimaDraws,HI TOM
27-08-2019T16:37:10,RimaDraws,i am deciding on what kind of keyboard and mouse to get for my computer
27-08-2019T16:37:18,Sclimshady,HOM! Hi Rima o/
27-08-2019T16:37:44,Sclimshady,I have the corsair cherry I think? its real nice
27-08-2019T16:38:04,IronHorseComics,mine's logitech
27-08-2019T16:38:05,RimaDraws,does it work well
27-08-2019T16:38:10,RimaDraws,slim?
27-08-2019T16:38:12,tehbear,cherry red? those are not click-ey
27-08-2019T16:38:14,RimaDraws,damn auto
27-08-2019T16:38:56,Sclimshady,"The K68 Mechanical, Cherry MX Red"
27-08-2019T16:39:22,IronHorseComics,"MINE works pretty well, it's a G300s gaming mouse."
27-08-2019T16:39:47,Sclimshady,"WAIT, nvm its the K70"
27-08-2019T16:39:52,Sclimshady,I am the dum
27-08-2019T16:40:11,tehbear,my faviourite keyboard is the micro$oft keyboard 600. ive had it for 6 years and it still works. was less than 20$
27-08-2019T16:41:45,RimaDraws,so mice and keyboard corsair?
27-08-2019T16:42:03,tehbear,"K70 looks nice, but i actually prefer the cheapo membrane keyboards."
27-08-2019T16:42:30,tehbear,do you game Rima?
27-08-2019T16:42:31,Sclimshady,I have the scimitar mouse from corsair
27-08-2019T16:43:50,RimaDraws,i like gaming yes. i never pampered myself on a pc before so i am going all out on it
27-08-2019T16:44:42,RimaDraws,added both the keyboard and mouse. those look nice
27-08-2019T16:45:33,Sclimshady,"I enjoy them,  it was actually my friend who helped me build mine that suggested the pair"
27-08-2019T16:46:11,tehbear,the corsair scimitar has lots of buttons on the side.
27-08-2019T16:46:43,Sclimshady,I use those for my reload and weapon swap functions in FPSs
27-08-2019T16:46:49,tehbear,1 dozen buttons to be exact
27-08-2019T16:47:07,Sclimshady,That would be pretty exact
27-08-2019T16:47:48,IronHorseComics,"I'd get a mouse like that but then I remember that I don't let my thumb hang out, it's holding the mouse too"
27-08-2019T16:48:27,tehbear,just have half a dozen buttons not do anything :D
27-08-2019T16:48:50,RimaDraws,yea its for hot keys in case you play MMOs
27-08-2019T16:48:53,Sclimshady,They are where you hold it with your thumb
27-08-2019T16:49:00,RimaDraws,i am thinking about getting a headset too
27-08-2019T16:49:32,Sclimshady,I had a real nice one but someone ripped it out of my laptop and destroyed the jack
27-08-2019T16:49:51,Sclimshady,Never got around to getting a new one
27-08-2019T16:50:11,IronHorseComics,good grief
27-08-2019T16:50:24,tehbear,someone?
27-08-2019T16:50:49,IronHorseComics,did they do it while you were standing there?
27-08-2019T16:50:54,Sclimshady,"Not their fault,  we had to get down because some rockets got fired at us"
27-08-2019T16:51:02,RimaDraws,turtle beach is looking good
27-08-2019T16:51:07,Sclimshady,They tripped on it in the process
27-08-2019T16:52:25,IronHorseComics,ah
27-08-2019T16:54:32,tehbear,im taking this isnt new year rockets.
27-08-2019T16:54:54,Sclimshady,"They did make some pretty fireworks, but no"
27-08-2019T17:29:37,IronHorseComics,"hmmm, what should I do for a second anniversary image? Fluffy 500 turns 2 in October and I think I should start work on something when I get back from Gulf Shores"
27-08-2019T17:44:33,Sclimshady,A champagne victory spray scene?
27-08-2019T17:46:58,IronHorseComics,"eeeehhhh maybe in a couple of years, don't want to risk any potential spoilers about which driver joins which motorsport team"
27-08-2019T17:47:54,IronHorseComics,plus I can include a much wider cast that way
27-08-2019T17:48:46,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
27-08-2019T17:49:39,IronHorseComics,goodnight Terra

27-08-2019T18:02:16,Sclimshady,Sounds good Iron
27-08-2019T18:06:40,RimaDraws,so i had to get rid of two friends that i didn't feel appreciated around
27-08-2019T18:07:13,IronHorseComics,what happened?
27-08-2019T18:07:13,RimaDraws,i really hated to do that but .....i didn't feel thanked for giving them words of encouragement and i never did feel appreciated
27-08-2019T18:07:53,IronHorseComics,were they IRL or internet friends?
27-08-2019T18:08:01,RimaDraws,like this friend was going through a rough time and i gave some encouraging words. online
27-08-2019T18:08:19,RimaDraws,and who do they thank out of a few people? a friend and his own gf
27-08-2019T18:08:23,RimaDraws,like dude thats just.
27-08-2019T18:09:05,RimaDraws,i have learned something the past few days since taking my classes for school and its that you surround yourself with the crowd that you want to be like most.
27-08-2019T18:11:20,IronHorseComics,sounds about right
27-08-2019T18:12:38,RimaDraws,so i decided to not surround myself with those people anymore.
27-08-2019T18:15:31,IronHorseComics,yeah I don't have anything to say anymore
27-08-2019T18:30:33,SpazztasticKiwi,two hours ahhhhh

27-08-2019T21:50:15,iliar,This is a strange feeling when it‚Äôs 6AM on clock and you are already at work.
27-08-2019T21:51:41,iliar,And the reason is that you did not go home.
