30-01-2019T13:34:02,Twokinds,Something's going on with the new update of Photoshop. It keeps messing up the text when I save the file.
30-01-2019T13:34:11,Twokinds,But randomly.

30-01-2019T14:13:49,QuinnMalachite,Thanks very much for that!
30-01-2019T14:40:58,SpazztasticKiwi,I tried a jalape√±o popper
30-01-2019T14:41:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Sad excuse for a hot pepper
30-01-2019T14:46:30,Twokinds,Waaaah
30-01-2019T14:46:43,Twokinds,Jalapenoes are great.
30-01-2019T14:46:47,Twokinds,I like how they taste.
30-01-2019T14:47:22,Twokinds,"They're not that hot, but that's why I can just pile them on."
30-01-2019T14:48:26,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm not supposed to have hot or spicy
30-01-2019T14:49:03,SpazztasticKiwi,But I tried one to see how hot they are since they‚Äôve never been a part or consideration in my diet
30-01-2019T14:49:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Not that I like hot or spicy anyway
30-01-2019T14:52:48,Twokinds,iliar I'm about to post a lot of art to dA
30-01-2019T14:52:57,Twokinds,The stuff I forgot to upload
30-01-2019T14:53:37,Twokinds,I'm concerned the bot is going to spam everyone. lol
30-01-2019T14:55:47,iliar,I like Jalapenos too. I don't like very hot eat. It's painful and not tasty. But Jalapenos is little hot and tasty.
30-01-2019T14:55:53,SpazztasticKiwi,So Nibbly has a bit of a nervous twitch
30-01-2019T14:56:17,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôll be ok for a bit - neons finally given her too much coffee
30-01-2019T14:56:42,SpazztasticKiwi,But I gotta go you two. I‚Äôll be back at lunch

30-01-2019T14:57:29,iliar,Well ... I do not think this is a big problem. But if you want I can disable this feature
30-01-2019T14:57:44,Twokinds,I guess if it's no problem
30-01-2019T14:57:47,Twokinds,It'll just be five
30-01-2019T15:02:18,Dadrobit,Back from the doctor. Blood pressure is a little high. But otherwise I'm outwardly pretty fine. Gonna have a battery of blood  tests done in a day or two to make sure everything inside is operating well.

30-01-2019T15:48:34,iliar,Okay. I can disable bot. But honestly I don't want to do that. Nibs send notifications only in this chat and one discord server. I think little spam not a problem.
30-01-2019T15:48:50,iliar,And about old arts.
30-01-2019T15:48:53,Twokinds,I wasn't saying you have to

30-01-2019T15:55:05,iliar,I worked a lot on your art database. So I understand how you feel.
