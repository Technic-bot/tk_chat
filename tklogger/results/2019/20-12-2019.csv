20-12-2019T00:00:01,SageSaga,i dunno- 8k skin textures are great
20-12-2019T00:00:06,Mihari,The human eye can only process so much XD
20-12-2019T00:00:16,Mihari,There are exceptions to everything.
20-12-2019T00:00:40,Mihari,That was actually proven
20-12-2019T00:01:22,Mihari,It's a combination of things
20-12-2019T00:02:00,SageSaga,turns out we can expand our ability to sense things- we can effectively overclock our brains letting us temporarily notice things more than we could before
20-12-2019T00:02:13,SageSaga,Focus is a big part of it
20-12-2019T00:02:37,SageSaga,its why in a video game we notice hitches and skips of frames into the 60 FPS range
20-12-2019T00:02:47,SageSaga,but dont notice a movie is only going at 24fps
20-12-2019T00:05:20,Combak,Yay for adrenaline!
20-12-2019T00:05:52,SageSaga,yep- if you've ever had an adrenaline rush you probably know that feeling like everything else is moving slower

20-12-2019T00:10:16,SageSaga,man - upscaling tech for anime has gotten so much better
20-12-2019T00:11:13,SageSaga,1080p anime up-scaled to 4k can still look really sharp
20-12-2019T00:12:19,SageSaga,too bad high frame rate interpolated animation looks horrible
20-12-2019T00:14:22,SageSaga,guess we need more robots watching anime
20-12-2019T00:18:02,AspiringNoodle,I need to watch My Hero Academia ;_;

20-12-2019T01:11:55,AspiringNoodle,Nyna is too precious
20-12-2019T01:11:57,AspiringNoodle,Also deadly
20-12-2019T01:14:31,Mihari,"What you all have to remember is that Nyna can magically materialize and change her clothes at whim, so you have to ask yourself why doesn't share have some kind of undergarment to begin with :P"
20-12-2019T01:14:59,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Air flow
20-12-2019T01:15:16,Ordithus,"it's rude to peek, so that's on you when she claws your face off"
20-12-2019T01:15:33,Mihari,Part of me thinks she wouldn't care if anyone did peek
20-12-2019T01:15:41,SageSaga,well to be fair she cant just make new clothes- her clothes are magic- but she isnt wearing magic panties...

20-12-2019T02:38:43,AspiringNoodle,^^^
20-12-2019T02:38:49,AspiringNoodle,I more or less watched DBZ / Naruto as a kid
20-12-2019T02:38:52,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I was one of those kids who's only source of anime was 4kids
20-12-2019T02:39:13,SageSaga,"then my father watched Neon Genesis Evangelion with me ""Cool robots!"" . . . ""What is that kid doing with that unconscious girl in the hospital"""
20-12-2019T02:39:14,AspiringNoodle,But they didn't see the Sexy Justu scenes from Naruto ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

20-12-2019T02:43:18,SageSaga,that wasnt my first

20-12-2019T02:43:42,BadFoMo,"Dad: ...I'm sorry. You are beyond help, son."
20-12-2019T02:44:06,AspiringNoodle,On a random note... anyone remember Code Lyoko?

20-12-2019T02:44:39,Mihari,"Hrm, I think Ranma was my first."
20-12-2019T02:45:46,Mihari,Sailor moon and Tenchi were later...
20-12-2019T02:45:46,BadFoMo,"I /think/ my first anime was ...Nossles, I think it was called? It was about these two toy Kowallas that could come to live."
20-12-2019T02:45:47,AspiringNoodle,"I need to recontinue the series.  I remember watching up to when the new kid joined them, and ended up being lost / possessed in that hidden cube sector"
20-12-2019T02:45:48,SageSaga,Mihari- do you remember my first? ive said it several times
20-12-2019T02:46:21,Mihari,Conan wasn't it?
20-12-2019T02:46:26,SageSaga,nope
20-12-2019T02:46:50,Mihari,I do know you just like that a lot or at the very least talk about it a fair bit

20-12-2019T02:47:51,Mihari,"hehe, wow so old XD"
20-12-2019T02:48:00,AspiringNoodle,...I think I remember one of my first anime aside from DBZ and before Naruto...
20-12-2019T02:48:20,SageSaga,Project A-ko was my first anime
20-12-2019T02:48:28,AspiringNoodle,It was one of the Gundam franchises.  The one with a global fighting tournament
20-12-2019T02:48:31,SageSaga,followed closely by- Akira
20-12-2019T02:48:41,SageSaga,btw as a young kid - i was not ready for Akira
20-12-2019T02:48:46,Mihari,I know I saw Akira after Ranma
20-12-2019T02:48:49,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Robotech was my first, thanks to my dad."
20-12-2019T02:48:58,Mihari,It was a rerelease

20-12-2019T02:49:38,LannAF,"like, you mean fully watched?"
20-12-2019T02:49:40,AspiringNoodle,*faints*

20-12-2019T02:50:10,LannAF,I grew up with two bigger sisters
20-12-2019T02:50:19,LannAF,and we only had one crappy dinky little tv.
20-12-2019T02:50:21,AspiringNoodle,Hmmm... I wonder...
20-12-2019T02:50:25,Mihari,The original Sailor Moon was intended for teenagers XD
20-12-2019T02:50:34,LannAF,I didn't understand jack or diddly
20-12-2019T02:50:41,Mihari,The dub was bastardized
20-12-2019T02:50:41,LannAF,just knew it was what was on tv.
20-12-2019T02:50:54,AspiringNoodle,"I'll be honest, I have several rather old anime I remember as a kid...  It's just a matter of when they were made / when I watched them :/"
20-12-2019T02:51:07,Mihari,I got to see the jap sailor moon way back when it aired due to satellite
20-12-2019T02:51:16,LannAF,the wonders of satellite tv
20-12-2019T02:51:25,LannAF,hey btw Sage and Mihari
20-12-2019T02:51:25,Mihari,At the time it was the shit
20-12-2019T02:51:30,SageSaga,i feel like i actually saw Sherlock Hound before i saw DBZ or Sailor Moon
20-12-2019T02:51:32,Mihari,Now it just sucks
20-12-2019T02:51:38,LannAF,found a game I think you'd like to play together
20-12-2019T02:51:38,AspiringNoodle,"That global fighting tournament Gundam (anyone remember the name?), DBZ, and Cardcaptor Sakura"
20-12-2019T02:51:49,LannAF,that doesn't require a full party of 8 nor versus.
20-12-2019T02:52:03,LannAF,or a specific number of people at all.
20-12-2019T02:52:06,SageSaga,MHW?

20-12-2019T02:53:40,LannAF,the difficulty and hectic nature of it is exactly what I like
20-12-2019T02:53:50,LannAF,plus teamwork
20-12-2019T02:53:56,LannAF,I like co-op in general
20-12-2019T02:53:58,AspiringNoodle,"Sage, no!"
20-12-2019T02:54:04,AspiringNoodle,Don't burn bridges with Lann :ptv-whiny:

20-12-2019T02:54:30,AspiringNoodle,"Is there a mime in the invisible house, too?"
20-12-2019T02:54:38,LannAF,wat.

20-12-2019T02:55:04,TeapotOfDoom,Seems like it
20-12-2019T02:55:16,TeapotOfDoom,It's still on my list tho
20-12-2019T02:55:23,AspiringNoodle,"I'm not joking, the Mr. Mime scene alone was worthy of admission to a theatre"
20-12-2019T02:55:29,BadFoMo,I got shamed out of Pokemon /years/ ago.
20-12-2019T02:55:31,AspiringNoodle,I nearly bust a gut
20-12-2019T02:55:52,LannAF,I have the memory of a nut
20-12-2019T02:55:54,SageSaga,i own it- in 4k
20-12-2019T02:55:55,AspiringNoodle,"FoMo, shame those who shame you.  Detective Pikachu is played by motherlovin' Deadpool"
20-12-2019T02:56:06,LannAF,hey sage
20-12-2019T02:56:07,BadFoMo,I know.
20-12-2019T02:56:13,SageSaga,hey Lann
20-12-2019T02:56:15,LannAF,"if I can't find somebody to buy my vive off me, would you want it?"
20-12-2019T02:56:19,Mihari,It makes me sad you call him Deadpool XD
20-12-2019T02:56:36,LannAF,"yeah, his actor's name is scarlett johansen"
20-12-2019T02:56:37,SageSaga,uhhh- im not gonna say no to a free vive
20-12-2019T02:56:37,AspiringNoodle,But... but... Ryan Reynolds IS Deadpool

20-12-2019T02:57:10,SageSaga,yes
20-12-2019T02:57:11,Mihari,That's not true either Noodle
20-12-2019T02:57:20,SageSaga,of course i would use a VR headset
20-12-2019T02:57:22,LannAF,okie dokes.
20-12-2019T02:57:27,AspiringNoodle,"Don't destroy my reality, Mihari :ptv-whiny:"
20-12-2019T02:57:40,TeapotOfDoom,Lol
20-12-2019T02:57:42,LannAF,The prices I've seen them going for (full kit and all) is like 500$
20-12-2019T02:57:46,LannAF,even on Ebay and used.
20-12-2019T02:57:48,LannAF,It's strange.
20-12-2019T02:57:53,Mihari,It's not.
20-12-2019T02:57:57,BadFoMo,I'm still waiting for Matrix style VR.
20-12-2019T02:57:59,SageSaga,and play that hentai game where you can grab the woman by the - legs and throw her off the building
20-12-2019T02:58:02,Mihari,People are trying to recoup a loss while they can.
20-12-2019T02:58:05,LannAF,uh huh.
20-12-2019T02:58:17,Mihari,New gear is coming that makes the old look like poo
20-12-2019T02:58:22,LannAF,well yeah
20-12-2019T02:58:24,LannAF,exactly
20-12-2019T02:58:26,TeapotOfDoom,I mean his youtube channel is not that far of from deadpool
20-12-2019T02:58:27,Mihari,So might as well try to unload
20-12-2019T02:58:34,LannAF,but aiming for that high is odd
20-12-2019T02:58:50,LannAF,although- it does make sense to consider the base stations themselves as 100$ a pop worthy
20-12-2019T02:58:54,LannAF,A bit.
20-12-2019T02:59:03,AspiringNoodle,They're trying to recoup their investment for adopting early by unloading on the poor people who don't keep up with tech news c:
20-12-2019T02:59:08,LannAF,Gives more tracking potential
20-12-2019T02:59:12,TeapotOfDoom,Also safe that's a nice kaylin face xD
20-12-2019T02:59:31,LannAF,"meh, I just want to get a small chunk going towards buying the index"
20-12-2019T02:59:39,LannAF,I wanna grab it by March next year.
20-12-2019T02:59:43,AspiringNoodle,My 1 regret is not investing in AMD stock back when they were $2 a share
20-12-2019T02:59:49,AspiringNoodle,And I knew something big (Ryzen) was coming
20-12-2019T02:59:49,LannAF,yeaaah
20-12-2019T02:59:55,RimaDraws,Hey
20-12-2019T02:59:57,LannAF,I even had a friend suggesting amd stocks hardcorer
20-12-2019T03:00:00,TeapotOfDoom,Hey rima
20-12-2019T03:00:00,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Rima
20-12-2019T03:00:01,LannAF,hardcore*
20-12-2019T03:00:02,LannAF,HI RIMA
20-12-2019T03:00:02,AspiringNoodle,Rima! :ptv-excited:
20-12-2019T03:00:18,AspiringNoodle,"Lann, if you had invested back in Feb of 2016, and you cashed out today"
20-12-2019T03:00:25,RimaDraws,Hey I’ve been gone because I’m relaxing finally cause I’m off work for two weeks
20-12-2019T03:00:25,AspiringNoodle,You'd get roughly a 15x return on investment
20-12-2019T03:00:33,RimaDraws,Was watching a little fuller house
20-12-2019T03:00:33,SageSaga,ya know- ive been playing MHW - but ive still never been able to get together a full team
20-12-2019T03:00:36,LannAF,hindsight's 20/20
20-12-2019T03:00:49,AspiringNoodle,It's given me 1 lesson
20-12-2019T03:01:00,AspiringNoodle,"If I ever catch rumbles of something like that again, I'm investing"
20-12-2019T03:01:12,TeapotOfDoom,Thanks captain hindsight!
20-12-2019T03:01:41,LannAF,captain hindsight's always got my back.
20-12-2019T03:02:03,RimaDraws,So how is all
20-12-2019T03:02:08,LannAF,bored
20-12-2019T03:02:08,TeapotOfDoom,But yeah it's just like crypto stuff
20-12-2019T03:02:09,Mihari,"In hindsight he does, Lann."
20-12-2019T03:02:18,LannAF,:thumbsup:
20-12-2019T03:02:26,AspiringNoodle,Apparently I've replaced Sage as Lann's friend
20-12-2019T03:02:38,AspiringNoodle,"And those bridges were burned, rebuilt, burned again, and atomized"
20-12-2019T03:02:39,TeapotOfDoom,Just got up. Goin for breakfast rn
20-12-2019T03:02:39,LannAF,I guess you'll be joining my dnd game
20-12-2019T03:02:41,RimaDraws,I thought I was their friend
20-12-2019T03:02:55,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Sage swap'd out like a used spark plug.
20-12-2019T03:03:14,Mihari,Low blow.
20-12-2019T03:03:16,LannAF,implying I have a limit of how many friends
20-12-2019T03:03:17,Mihari,Shots fired.
20-12-2019T03:03:21,RimaDraws,Bitch got served
20-12-2019T03:03:23,LannAF,I can annoy
20-12-2019T03:03:26,RimaDraws,Ouch
20-12-2019T03:03:29,AspiringNoodle,I have a friend limit
20-12-2019T03:03:31,AspiringNoodle,24 ;)
20-12-2019T03:03:39,RimaDraws,Well I have a small group
20-12-2019T03:03:43,Mihari,I have sanity limit.
20-12-2019T03:03:48,LannAF,like 99% of my friends don't message me first
20-12-2019T03:03:56,SageSaga,I tried getting Lann and Tom to play MHW with me... I failed
20-12-2019T03:04:04,RimaDraws,Well I’m pretty sure me and my bestie are no longer besties
20-12-2019T03:04:07,LannAF,so it's really just a matter of whether people have high maintenance or low maintenance without requiring input.
20-12-2019T03:04:17,LannAF,eyyy rima I had a situation like that happen recently
20-12-2019T03:04:20,LannAF,sage is my bestie
20-12-2019T03:04:35,LannAF,I have a few people I consider my best friends
20-12-2019T03:04:44,Mihari,"I mean even I have messaged Lann first, and messaging people first... that's like damn divine intervention shit right there."
20-12-2019T03:04:49,RimaDraws,She doesn’t want to see me this Christmas and I haven’t seen her in six months. She wants a weekend free but she wouldn’t need that if she didn’t work
20-12-2019T03:05:00,LannAF,yeah that's pretty accurate mihari
20-12-2019T03:05:00,RimaDraws,Now that she has a bf she spends all her time with him
20-12-2019T03:05:14,LannAF,I don't have the energy/time to message literally all my friends all the time anymore
20-12-2019T03:05:21,LannAF,so it's a godsend to have people who hit me up first
20-12-2019T03:05:40,RimaDraws,I don’t ever have anyone hit me up first
20-12-2019T03:05:48,RimaDraws,It’s always me so that says a lot
20-12-2019T03:05:55,Mihari,"90% of people who hit me up first, want something."
20-12-2019T03:05:57,LannAF,that's more common than you'd think rima
20-12-2019T03:06:04,LannAF,what mihari said.
20-12-2019T03:06:09,TeapotOfDoom,Pretty accurate mihari
20-12-2019T03:06:17,SageSaga,I only message Mihari regularly- everyone else i gotta use an ice breaker- like Baby Yoda
20-12-2019T03:06:19,RimaDraws,Well I’m pretty sure I’m in mihari’s situation too
20-12-2019T03:06:28,LannAF,"If people hit you up first, it's sadly kinda accurate that they -usually- have some motive that isn't just ""hey I wanna hang out with you or see how you're doing"""
20-12-2019T03:06:29,RimaDraws,No one wants me unless they want something
20-12-2019T03:06:59,LannAF,I actually made a lot of people feel paranoid back in the day because I'd always just talk to them
20-12-2019T03:07:14,AspiringNoodle,I like real friends
20-12-2019T03:07:16,LannAF,and not ask for anything- well- other than playing games occasionally or hanging out in voice.
20-12-2019T03:07:16,Mihari,"I get it why some people don't message first, because I some how have this crazy furry ranking so that limits some people... but the rest I dun get."
20-12-2019T03:07:21,AspiringNoodle,So I like chatting with my online friends
20-12-2019T03:07:31,AspiringNoodle,"But they rarely want to talk, so I feel weird :ptv-uneasy:"
20-12-2019T03:07:41,AspiringNoodle,I lack real friends*
20-12-2019T03:07:51,LannAF,unless someone deliberately acts like a pompous ass I don't really care about the social standings of peeps
20-12-2019T03:07:52,RimaDraws,I do have friends at work wanting me to get nails done Monday so I’m getting out of my comfort zone to go
20-12-2019T03:08:03,LannAF,I've met and been friends with some pretty popular people who just wanted to be treated normal
20-12-2019T03:08:08,LannAF,and not feared or revered
20-12-2019T03:08:32,LannAF,the best way to be friends with someone is treat them like a normal human being/friend
20-12-2019T03:08:48,AspiringNoodle,"Welp, guess I can never be friends with Tom :P"
20-12-2019T03:08:52,RimaDraws,I almost said no but I went ahead and said yes
20-12-2019T03:09:07,LannAF,I find it hilarious how people act towards tom
20-12-2019T03:09:08,AspiringNoodle,"Or Chu, or Sage, or... *pulls out mile-long list*"
20-12-2019T03:09:10,LannAF,especially at conventions
20-12-2019T03:09:17,AspiringNoodle,"Oh, do tell!"
20-12-2019T03:09:18,LannAF,sage is a great friend
20-12-2019T03:09:28,RimaDraws,I want to meet Tom but I’m hoping I can go to anthrocon next year and meet sage
20-12-2019T03:09:36,LannAF,albeit- you need to learn a few things first
20-12-2019T03:09:39,SageSaga,Shhhh i must keep my friendlyness a secret
20-12-2019T03:09:40,LannAF,but sage is a wonderful friend
20-12-2019T03:09:41,RimaDraws,But I probably won’t be able to say anything
20-12-2019T03:10:06,AspiringNoodle,I'd be the suspicious person hiding behind stuff giving off a major stalker vibe
20-12-2019T03:10:22,AspiringNoodle,But in reality I'm freaking the fugg out and trying to work off the anxiety to talk to someone I look up to :P
20-12-2019T03:10:48,RimaDraws,I get too nervous to speak to someone i admire. I did that with sonny strait when I met him at my home con
20-12-2019T03:11:08,MarvTheHugPharaoh,You met Sonny?
20-12-2019T03:11:13,RimaDraws,Yea I did
20-12-2019T03:11:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Thats hype
20-12-2019T03:11:29,LannAF,tom's probably the least intimidating guy I know
20-12-2019T03:11:29,RimaDraws,He let me watch his booth for him and I even have the art he drew for me
20-12-2019T03:11:35,LannAF,but people are -terrified- of him
20-12-2019T03:11:50,RimaDraws,I don’t mean terrified just
20-12-2019T03:11:56,RimaDraws,You know
20-12-2019T03:12:08,LannAF,like social charisma goes to a -5?
20-12-2019T03:12:13,SageSaga,well you can just talk to me and i'll introduce him to make it easier
20-12-2019T03:12:16,RimaDraws,I’m a huge introvert so it’s gonna take a while to me to talk to a stranger
20-12-2019T03:12:39,LannAF,I became friends with sage because he taught me how to create a hobo shack and a nuclear reactor!
20-12-2019T03:12:48,LannAF,I still remember it like yesterday.
20-12-2019T03:12:50,RimaDraws,Lol
20-12-2019T03:12:51,TeapotOfDoom,At breakfast location so I'm gone for now. Have a good one!
20-12-2019T03:12:55,AspiringNoodle,I'm just imagining Tom has the uncanny ability to roll natural 20's
20-12-2019T03:12:57,SageSaga,the trick is to use the nuclear reactor for warmth
20-12-2019T03:13:03,RimaDraws,And yea sage I’ll remember that if I go to ac next year
20-12-2019T03:13:06,LannAF,tom's legit lucky.
20-12-2019T03:13:07,AspiringNoodle,But he has a trait that inverts the meaning of rolls :P
20-12-2019T03:13:12,MarvTheHugPharaoh,So I'm taking Sage when I raid chernobyl
20-12-2019T03:13:18,LannAF,I remember the first time I met a lot of my friends
20-12-2019T03:14:03,LannAF,Pretty much everyone actually.
20-12-2019T03:14:13,LannAF,Mihari is my oldest friend at this point I believe
20-12-2019T03:14:39,LannAF,"Playing Sniper Elite Nazi Zombies after organizing a small group with her, a guy called DarkParu, and Pocket Sand later on."
20-12-2019T03:15:08,LannAF,"Sage playing Minecraft on a group discord server and me taking interest in his nuclear reactor, needing a place to stay, and liking listening to him explain things to me"
20-12-2019T03:15:13,RimaDraws,I know when I go to anthrocon I’m also gonna go see the mr Rogers exhibit
20-12-2019T03:15:32,SageSaga,it wasnt discord
20-12-2019T03:15:39,AspiringNoodle,*shhhhhhhhh*
20-12-2019T03:15:39,LannAF,er
20-12-2019T03:15:46,LannAF,mumble
20-12-2019T03:15:49,AspiringNoodle,If you reveal any discrepancies in his memory
20-12-2019T03:15:53,LannAF,I meant discord as in voice chat now lmao
20-12-2019T03:15:55,AspiringNoodle,THE UNIVERSE MIGHT BREAK! :ptv-shock:
20-12-2019T03:16:06,LannAF,discord is synonymous with voice chat for me at this point.
20-12-2019T03:16:13,SageSaga,dont do that
20-12-2019T03:16:18,LannAF,but I waaannna
20-12-2019T03:16:25,RimaDraws,Lol
20-12-2019T03:16:37,LannAF,I met BadXAsh during a l4d2 game Mihari invited me to
20-12-2019T03:16:40,SageSaga,next thing ya know people will be saying they want a Kleenex instead of a facial tissue!
20-12-2019T03:16:48,LannAF,Avencri during a Natural Selection 2 game ash and I organized.
20-12-2019T03:16:56,AspiringNoodle,There's other brands besides Kleenex?!?
20-12-2019T03:16:57,RimaDraws,Lol sage
20-12-2019T03:17:02,LannAF,:teedus:
20-12-2019T03:17:18,AspiringNoodle,Next you're going to tell me Windows isn't the only operating system
20-12-2019T03:18:07,SageSaga,Quick! I need an adhesive bandage!
20-12-2019T03:18:31,LannAF,you mean
20-12-2019T03:18:35,LannAF,A BAND-AID?
20-12-2019T03:18:53,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"""I require antiseptic neosporin."""
20-12-2019T03:19:04,LannAF,my mom's buying me a nintendo for christmas
20-12-2019T03:19:09,LannAF,hur
20-12-2019T03:19:14,MarvTheHugPharaoh,A N64?
20-12-2019T03:19:18,LannAF,no
20-12-2019T03:19:20,LannAF,a nintendo
20-12-2019T03:19:29,MarvTheHugPharaoh,A whole nintendo?
20-12-2019T03:19:29,BadFoMo,A cube?
20-12-2019T03:19:37,AspiringNoodle,I can't keep up with all this techno-whoosits
20-12-2019T03:19:46,AspiringNoodle,I'm gonna google some of these terms
20-12-2019T03:20:06,LannAF,my mom actually -did- use to call all my gaming systems nintendos when I was a kid
20-12-2019T03:20:23,AspiringNoodle,My dad used to tell me to pause my games
20-12-2019T03:20:26,LannAF,now it's playstations
20-12-2019T03:20:31,SpazztasticKiwi,my mom calls all youtubers jacksepiceyes
20-12-2019T03:20:34,LannAF,LOL
20-12-2019T03:20:34,AspiringNoodle,When I mostly played multiplayer / online games :ptv-laugh:
20-12-2019T03:20:54,AspiringNoodle,Not even joking
20-12-2019T03:21:10,AspiringNoodle,Took like 10 years of WoW for him to learn I *can't* pause the entire friggin' server!
20-12-2019T03:21:24,RimaDraws,Pfft
20-12-2019T03:21:31,SpazztasticKiwi,my sister once asked me which one was the one that sounded like a cereal (CinnamontoastKen)
20-12-2019T03:22:36,SageSaga,"""Hey guys- i need yall to stop doing everything for a while"""
20-12-2019T03:22:57,SageSaga,"""Ah your dad need something? Its ok- the 3000 of ous will wait"""
20-12-2019T03:23:07,SageSaga,of us*
20-12-2019T03:23:08,LannAF,-twiddles thumbs-
20-12-2019T03:23:49,SpazztasticKiwi,my mom also thought Jacksepticeye was Mark so
20-12-2019T03:23:53,BadFoMo,"Albert Enstine: There are only two thing that are infinit; The Universe, the the number of time you need the tell your parants you can't pause an online game, and I'm not sure about the former."
20-12-2019T03:23:59,SpazztasticKiwi,and she still can’t twll them apart
20-12-2019T03:24:03,SpazztasticKiwi,tell
20-12-2019T03:24:04,LannAF,as a small throwback to that convo we were having before about being scared of people for x social reason
20-12-2019T03:24:32,SpazztasticKiwi,when I met Seán I wasn’t scared as much as excited
20-12-2019T03:24:41,RimaDraws,But yea I’ll be scared to talk lol
20-12-2019T03:24:44,SpazztasticKiwi,brain was like ❗️❗️❗️
20-12-2019T03:24:44,LannAF,"just remember that they're all people too. treat them like any other person and if they act like a dick to you or uninterested in you, it's not really worth throwing any further effort/distress over it"
20-12-2019T03:25:13,AspiringNoodle,*meets Tom*
20-12-2019T03:25:17,LannAF,unless everybody causes distress
20-12-2019T03:25:19,AspiringNoodle,*speaks fluent Keidran*
20-12-2019T03:25:21,LannAF,in which case- idk lol
20-12-2019T03:25:31,AspiringNoodle,"Tom: ""...how did you manage that?"""
20-12-2019T03:25:39,AspiringNoodle,Me: ...I don't know *sweats bullets*
20-12-2019T03:25:51,LannAF,I want to meet RussianBadger in real life
20-12-2019T03:25:53,Mihari,I remember the year my parents scoured for the snes cart for FF6
20-12-2019T03:25:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I have a feeling that situation would end up more like “security!”
20-12-2019T03:25:56,LannAF,he seems like a genuinely hilarious dude
20-12-2019T03:26:19,Mihari,It was the only thing I asked for XD
20-12-2019T03:26:28,Mihari,I felt so bad afterwards XD

20-12-2019T03:28:18,LannAF,the chaos and stupidity of some of the situations
20-12-2019T03:28:21,RimaDraws,I’ll definitely meet you too Lann
20-12-2019T03:28:28,LannAF,he's a nice nerd but genuinely cool and nice
20-12-2019T03:28:29,SpazztasticKiwi,you’re all nerds
20-12-2019T03:28:50,LannAF,"rima, I'm the type of person who usually tries to make people feel as comfortable as possible"
20-12-2019T03:29:03,LannAF,but I'm also boisterous and loud
20-12-2019T03:29:11,SageSaga,no man - i . . . I was in the chess club...
20-12-2019T03:29:16,RimaDraws,Good I’ll need one of those lol. I act extroverted but I’m extremely introverted if that makes sense
20-12-2019T03:29:27,LannAF,I'm an extrovert through and through
20-12-2019T03:29:49,SageSaga,and I choked in the big tournament
20-12-2019T03:29:53,LannAF,If anybody needs help I'm there in a jiffy
20-12-2019T03:29:53,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m just a mess
20-12-2019T03:29:55,LannAF,"oof, that sucks sage."

20-12-2019T03:30:46,SageSaga,nah but i legit touched the wrong piece and lost the game because of it
20-12-2019T03:30:52,LannAF,aw man
20-12-2019T03:31:17,Mihari,Tournament chess has a ton of technical rules that just suck.
20-12-2019T03:32:19,SageSaga,oh my Tech Class teachers name was Peter Parker
20-12-2019T03:32:28,AspiringNoodle,"I'm gonna go to bed guys, too tired"
20-12-2019T03:32:34,LannAF,Goodnight!
20-12-2019T03:32:36,AspiringNoodle,"Also, awww, sorry about that sage :c"

20-12-2019T03:33:24,SageSaga,?
20-12-2019T03:33:25,LannAF,did you think I was more or less overbearing when you first met me irl?
20-12-2019T03:33:31,LannAF,or just the same
20-12-2019T03:33:48,SageSaga,nah- pretty much you were the same as you are online
20-12-2019T03:34:13,Mihari,I wonder if anyone would figure out who I was if I kept my hair up in a hat or something. XD
20-12-2019T03:34:30,SageSaga,probably not
20-12-2019T03:34:33,SpazztasticKiwi,what do you call a bunch of chess players bragging about their skills in a hotel lobby
20-12-2019T03:34:37,SpazztasticKiwi,chess nuts boastin on an open foyer
20-12-2019T03:35:02,LannAF,probs not Mihari
20-12-2019T03:35:03,SageSaga,though now i will be on the look out for a girl with great legs wearing a hat
20-12-2019T03:35:06,SageSaga,huehuehue

20-12-2019T03:35:23,LannAF,she's got a hat
20-12-2019T03:35:26,LannAF,:thumbsup:
20-12-2019T03:35:40,SageSaga,Sticky not as tall as Mihari though
20-12-2019T03:35:46,LannAF,oof.
20-12-2019T03:35:48,LannAF,low blow
20-12-2019T03:35:55,LannAF,I suppose literally since she's kinda short.
20-12-2019T03:36:03,Mihari,"And I'm 5'10"""
20-12-2019T03:36:11,LannAF,fuck you're taller than me by an inch
20-12-2019T03:36:15,SageSaga,XD
20-12-2019T03:36:16,LannAF,unless I've grown
20-12-2019T03:36:20,LannAF,BRB
20-12-2019T03:36:36,Mihari,"5'11"" or 6 shoe depending."
20-12-2019T03:36:46,BadFoMo,Inb4 Lann: FUUUU!
20-12-2019T03:36:49,SageSaga,"Lann has nice broad shoulders, very manly"
20-12-2019T03:37:46,Mihari,"I think only Sage would pick up on how I'd talk in RL, since he's known me so long he's seen the change."
20-12-2019T03:38:24,Mihari,I never cuss offline XD It's weird.
20-12-2019T03:38:32,LannAF,aww sage thanks
20-12-2019T03:38:40,LannAF,also results inconclusive.
20-12-2019T03:38:46,LannAF,I must go get a doctor's appointment
20-12-2019T03:38:49,SageSaga,i would dare say Lann is quiet handsome if he werent so goofy
20-12-2019T03:38:54,LannAF,OI
20-12-2019T03:38:55,RimaDraws,lol
20-12-2019T03:38:57,RimaDraws,awwwww
20-12-2019T03:39:01,LannAF,my girlfriend calls me cute
20-12-2019T03:39:02,LannAF,ok
20-12-2019T03:39:04,Mihari,I'm pretty sure I said that a long time ago when he was sharing images.
20-12-2019T03:39:06,RimaDraws,AW
20-12-2019T03:39:16,LannAF,eh.
20-12-2019T03:39:20,LannAF,I'd rather be goofy than handsome
20-12-2019T03:39:34,Mihari,Well you can be a handsome goof
20-12-2019T03:39:38,Mihari,So...
20-12-2019T03:39:46,LannAF,I CAN?
20-12-2019T03:39:51,RimaDraws,yes
20-12-2019T03:39:56,SageSaga,well Lann if you ever want to look handsome you just gotta get the look down instead of your smirk/smile
20-12-2019T03:39:59,LannAF,maybe if I actually took care of my facial hair
20-12-2019T03:40:00,Mihari,"Nathan Fillon, Ryan Renolds?"
20-12-2019T03:40:33,LannAF,dude I'd make out with ryan reynolds and I don't even swing that way
20-12-2019T03:40:38,LannAF,so that's big compliment
20-12-2019T03:40:44,SageSaga,Lann is a bit Nathan esque
20-12-2019T03:41:03,Mihari,"Just saying you can as charming or goofy as you want, and still be handsom."
20-12-2019T03:41:15,LannAF,tbh
20-12-2019T03:41:20,LannAF,if I took care of my EVERGROWING facial hair
20-12-2019T03:41:34,LannAF,"just a tad bit more, and actually held back how I act at times like I used to"
20-12-2019T03:41:47,LannAF,I could probably do well
20-12-2019T03:41:59,LannAF,but that's effort.
20-12-2019T03:42:13,SageSaga,yall have my music on?
20-12-2019T03:42:24,LannAF,facial hair sucks
20-12-2019T03:42:25,LannAF,and nope.
20-12-2019T03:43:27,LannAF,what song is it?
20-12-2019T03:43:37,SpazztasticKiwi,thank God I came out instead of “David” then
20-12-2019T03:43:42,SageSaga,The theme from Ascendance of a Bookworm
20-12-2019T03:44:18,LannAF,oh yeah.
20-12-2019T03:44:25,LannAF,Sticky began watching it without me
20-12-2019T03:44:33,SageSaga,waaa
20-12-2019T03:44:36,LannAF,because she didn't hear me when I said we should watch it together xD
20-12-2019T03:44:54,LannAF,I only discovered because she had woken me up in the middle of the night to feed me soba
20-12-2019T03:44:56,SpazztasticKiwi,all that means is you can watch it twice
20-12-2019T03:45:00,LannAF,and she was watching it
20-12-2019T03:45:07,LannAF,I love this theme though
20-12-2019T03:45:11,SageSaga,does she like it?

20-12-2019T03:50:25,LannAF,you wouldn't be able to come to my birthday bash if you were going tomorrow
20-12-2019T03:50:27,LannAF,:C
20-12-2019T03:50:42,SageSaga,i gotta start fasting on your birthday bash
20-12-2019T03:50:51,SageSaga,cant eat anything

20-12-2019T03:51:08,Mihari,In a cosmically evil way

20-12-2019T03:51:38,Mihari,My appetite has come back with a vengeance
20-12-2019T03:51:54,SageSaga,no- wisdom teeth were cut out of my head many years ago- Sept 10th- the day before the towers fell
20-12-2019T03:51:57,Mihari,Tell me when you start so we can record from that point on.
20-12-2019T03:52:04,BadFoMo,Oh...
20-12-2019T03:52:33,LannAF,I uh
20-12-2019T03:52:40,LannAF,I'm not sure I'm down with that
20-12-2019T03:52:45,Mihari,LOL
20-12-2019T03:52:46,LannAF,I -was- planning on webcamming on discord though
20-12-2019T03:52:53,LannAF,just not necessarily with recording
20-12-2019T03:52:58,LannAF,I have no idea how I'd act
20-12-2019T03:53:09,Mihari,The recording is only to provide you the next day when your sober to listen back
20-12-2019T03:53:16,LannAF,my only references are cuddly and REALLY prone to laughing fits
20-12-2019T03:53:24,LannAF,hmmm
20-12-2019T03:53:33,LannAF,not sure if I trust the validity of that statement
20-12-2019T03:53:43,Mihari,I don't lie.
20-12-2019T03:53:48,LannAF,not like I have any dignity left anyways either way
20-12-2019T03:54:02,LannAF,I just hope at least one other person joins me in drinking
20-12-2019T03:54:09,Mihari,Sadly I can not.
20-12-2019T03:54:22,LannAF,that's fair
20-12-2019T03:54:23,SageSaga,and i dont drink- and i will be unconcious
20-12-2019T03:54:25,Mihari,Pretty sure that would kill me XD
20-12-2019T03:54:37,LannAF,yeah don't do that

20-12-2019T03:55:28,SageSaga,telling me my operation is at Noon
20-12-2019T03:55:32,LannAF,Mainly I just want to have a small speech about stuff in general
20-12-2019T03:55:36,LannAF,uhhh
20-12-2019T03:55:38,LannAF,noon on monday?

20-12-2019T03:55:54,Mihari,The heck...
20-12-2019T03:56:22,Mihari,Maybe they want you to check in at 8am? And the actual operation is at noon?
20-12-2019T03:56:23,SageSaga,so i currently dont know when it really is- and i called 20 times today and never got through- left a message
20-12-2019T03:56:28,Mihari,Cause that sounds legit hospital timing XD
20-12-2019T03:56:40,SageSaga,nah they need 1 hour for prep

20-12-2019T04:07:22,BadFoMo,Bye.
20-12-2019T04:11:45,SageSaga,it must be that time of night
20-12-2019T04:11:55,BadFoMo,Hmm?
20-12-2019T04:12:38,SageSaga,theres only like 15 people in the chat- but theres over 30 viewers
20-12-2019T04:13:24,SageSaga,ah- yep- people going offline and im number 1 on the picarto main page
20-12-2019T04:13:44,ZRO4825,lol
20-12-2019T04:13:47,BadFoMo,Cool.
20-12-2019T04:14:17,BadFoMo,40 viewer now.
20-12-2019T04:14:26,BadFoMo,*viewers
20-12-2019T04:14:48,RendakDarkgale,:ok_hand:
20-12-2019T04:16:09,SageSaga,"see if more of them were in chat i'd be like ""Hey- i also do this comic over here- https://www.artificialincident.com """
20-12-2019T04:16:45,BadFoMo,Haha.
20-12-2019T04:18:58,SageSaga,"also i really dont get why people were like ""hey its a little kid and a dark elf! their going to have sex!"" im like - first off- hes a kid- so no- and second- How many girls does she need to hit on for people to believe shes a lesbian?"
20-12-2019T04:20:21,BadFoMo,...What is wrong with people?
20-12-2019T04:21:23,SpazztasticKiwi,there’s a few explanations
20-12-2019T04:21:30,SpazztasticKiwi,"not good, but 🤷🏻‍♀️"
20-12-2019T04:22:25,SageSaga,She wasnt into the young Elf boys- why would she be interested in a kid?
20-12-2019T04:23:03,SageSaga,just saying- those elves were in their hundreds of years old and were cute- if shes not gonna go for them at all this makes no sense
20-12-2019T04:24:23,SageSaga,done!
20-12-2019T04:24:56,BadFoMo,Ding! Fries are done!
20-12-2019T04:25:00,SageSaga,good night folks! thanks for joining!
20-12-2019T04:25:11,ZRO4825,"G'night, Sage! Good work, take care. ^_^"
20-12-2019T04:25:14,BadFoMo,Good night.
20-12-2019T04:25:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"sad but true, the idea some are still ok with older women with too young males"
20-12-2019T04:26:08,SageSaga,hmm maybe after a short break i should work on that commission-
20-12-2019T04:26:17,SpazztasticKiwi,power nap
20-12-2019T04:26:19,ZRO4825,o.o;
20-12-2019T04:26:28,BadFoMo,Hmm?
20-12-2019T04:26:39,SageSaga,im close to finishing it and i also gotta work on a filler picture for Christmas
20-12-2019T04:26:56,SageSaga,i wanna get it all done before my operation
20-12-2019T04:27:09,SageSaga,slight chance they put me under and i wake up after christmas
20-12-2019T04:27:23,BadFoMo,Dang!
20-12-2019T04:27:53,SageSaga,thats a risk any time ya get put under for an operation - very very very very  low risk- but possible XD
20-12-2019T04:28:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"if it happens tomorrow, I find a 3 day sleep concerning under drugs like sedation"
20-12-2019T04:28:07,SpazztasticKiwi,I believe that’s called a coma
20-12-2019T04:29:00,SageSaga,its possible something goes wrong- they puncture something they shouldnt have- i go into emergency surgery- and i get put in a medical coma
20-12-2019T04:29:31,SpazztasticKiwi,the good news is you’re looking at the bright side
20-12-2019T04:29:37,SageSaga,and next thing i know I missed updating AI and i feel really bad for not putting it on auto post
20-12-2019T04:30:13,SageSaga,later folks! im gonna take my break XD
20-12-2019T04:53:05,SpazztasticKiwi,when lann is available I gots a question for him

20-12-2019T15:17:08,SageSaga,yo
20-12-2019T15:21:13,SageSaga,it's apparently quiet stream day
20-12-2019T15:33:40,sunblaze,hi everyone
20-12-2019T15:33:56,SageSaga,yo Sunblaze
20-12-2019T15:34:58,sunblaze,quiet stream might just eman it will get loud and exhausting later
20-12-2019T15:36:24,SageSaga,at the current rate i will be done before  it can XD
20-12-2019T15:39:50,Werewing,Just use music to fill the silence
20-12-2019T15:39:51,SageSaga,for only working for the past 40 minutes ive made a ton of progress
20-12-2019T15:40:05,SageSaga,i have music playing-
20-12-2019T15:40:25,Werewing,I know. Now you just need to make sure it stays loud.
20-12-2019T15:40:55,Werewing,"For a moment, I thought that kid was staring straight into the elven cleavage."
20-12-2019T15:42:19,SageSaga,Callum is good boy
20-12-2019T15:43:25,sunblaze,for now
20-12-2019T15:43:36,sunblaze,didn't he threaten her with a wand just a page ago?
20-12-2019T15:43:44,sunblaze,grated he had reason to
20-12-2019T15:43:45,SageSaga,she did break into his house
20-12-2019T15:44:34,Werewing,"Yes, but they were friends in two different lives."
20-12-2019T15:44:46,SageSaga,no they werent! XD
20-12-2019T15:44:48,sunblaze,familliar at least. friend maybe
20-12-2019T15:44:55,SageSaga,they had met in passing
20-12-2019T15:45:09,FoxxTrotter,:cfoxxtrotter-FoxEye:
20-12-2019T15:45:45,sunblaze,well if there are so few child players he'd leave a pretty memorable impression I guess
20-12-2019T15:45:58,Werewing,"I thought the player had become somewhat successful, too. I wonder if that will help with recognition."
20-12-2019T15:46:03,SageSaga,hmm - did he? Hes been in the comic already
20-12-2019T15:46:27,Werewing,It has been longer for us than for them.
20-12-2019T15:46:49,SageSaga,*are you sure about that* meme
20-12-2019T15:50:15,Werewing,"Oh, so they met before the (possible) time jump. Found him on Prol. 19. I think."
20-12-2019T15:50:32,Werewing,Guess he gave up with wizard dream to become an artificer.
20-12-2019T15:52:25,sunblaze,really? oh neat *must investigate*
20-12-2019T15:53:45,sunblaze,ha! he was exactly the NPC I thought of before investigating
20-12-2019T15:53:56,sunblaze,he REALLY did leave a lasting impression
20-12-2019T15:54:04,SageSaga,PC not NPC
20-12-2019T15:54:25,sunblaze,true
20-12-2019T15:55:14,Werewing,He looks a teensy bit different. Kevin or Kaylin have an excellent memory.
20-12-2019T15:55:35,Werewing,Must be the lighting.
20-12-2019T15:55:41,sunblaze,or the hat
20-12-2019T15:55:56,Werewing,Hat Lighting.
20-12-2019T15:55:58,SageSaga,or he's older now... and yes- the hat XD
20-12-2019T16:01:38,sunblaze,steam engine?
20-12-2019T16:01:44,sunblaze,he sure is heating up old ideas
20-12-2019T16:01:53,sunblaze,dies from punning
20-12-2019T16:02:25,Werewing,That or maybe he just wants to access the Steam store while the holiday sale is going on.
20-12-2019T16:02:49,sunblaze,trapped in an MoRPG and no access to steam.
20-12-2019T16:02:52,sunblaze,what a nightmare
20-12-2019T16:04:13,SageSaga,Callum is smart boy
20-12-2019T16:18:42,SageSaga,an hour and 20 minutes in and im actually really close to being done o_o
20-12-2019T16:19:08,Werewing,"If you finish, do you start on your buffer, comms, or personal joy?"
20-12-2019T16:19:26,sunblaze,wow you cheived speeddrawing
20-12-2019T16:19:36,sunblaze,"only 1,5% of artists have that!"
20-12-2019T16:19:55,SageSaga,i dont do a buffer because i do the sketch and coloring for AI every week Friday and Saturday
20-12-2019T16:20:28,SageSaga,if i did buffer work- people would get a multi-week preview on stream
20-12-2019T16:21:12,SageSaga,and most commission work i dont do on stream
20-12-2019T16:21:47,SageSaga,some of the commission stuff is private since they use the art in books and for their personal Patreons and things like that
20-12-2019T16:21:59,SageSaga,I do patreon work on Friday nights though
20-12-2019T16:23:07,SageSaga,so when i finish this i will probably just end early and hopefully see if i can get my new mic working on the pc so i can run Dungeons and Dragons tonight for my friends
20-12-2019T16:23:56,sunblaze,good playing RPG gives the best inspirations for jokes and riducolous stunts to write and draw :D
20-12-2019T16:35:09,Ordithus,Hello!
20-12-2019T16:35:44,SageSaga,yo Ord
20-12-2019T16:36:39,Ordithus,How are ya?
20-12-2019T16:36:50,SageSaga,alright so far i supose
20-12-2019T16:37:24,SageSaga,i do feel like a chunk out of the back of my throat is missing which is weird
20-12-2019T16:37:31,Ordithus,That sounds weird
20-12-2019T16:39:04,SageSaga,it's been that way for a few days now- which is weird because usually stuff like that goes away fast
20-12-2019T16:40:43,Ordithus,Are you sick at all?
20-12-2019T16:40:53,Ordithus,:eyes: hot air balloon
20-12-2019T16:41:07,SageSaga,nah i dont feel sick
20-12-2019T16:41:33,SageSaga,i had a sore throat 2-3 weeks ago
20-12-2019T16:49:48,Ordithus,Do the adventurers still level up?
20-12-2019T16:50:39,SageSaga,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
20-12-2019T16:51:36,SageSaga,Kaylin hasnt checked her XP and Callum here hasnt said anything about it
20-12-2019T16:52:13,SageSaga,Kaylin of course wouldnt really check it considering shes Max Level
20-12-2019T16:53:11,Ordithus,"But the ""what the hell happened"" forced DLC may have increased it, who knows"
20-12-2019T16:53:53,SageSaga,Kevin might think of something like that- Kaylin though doesnt
20-12-2019T16:55:27,Ordithus,Either way Callum here *might* have gained a few levels
20-12-2019T16:57:04,TeapotOfDoom,Yo sage
20-12-2019T16:57:11,SageSaga,yo Teapot
20-12-2019T16:57:19,TeapotOfDoom,Looks like i'm quite late
20-12-2019T16:57:25,Ordithus,hi teapot
20-12-2019T16:57:34,SageSaga,ehhh XD i actually did this really fast today

20-12-2019T16:57:46,SageSaga,its been less than 2 hours and i think im done
20-12-2019T16:58:00,Ordithus,Time to add more random stuff!
20-12-2019T16:58:03,TeapotOfDoom,Well I mean you're demon speed anyway
20-12-2019T16:58:34,SageSaga,with as dark as the room is I dont know if i should do hair shinies
20-12-2019T16:58:54,SageSaga,i guess i should though -
20-12-2019T16:59:00,SageSaga,even though theres less like-
20-12-2019T16:59:28,SageSaga,(also i know they are called highlights- im just being silly)
20-12-2019T16:59:31,TeapotOfDoom,Maybe some kind of shadowy effect?
20-12-2019T17:00:09,TeapotOfDoom,Man my stream is acting up hard tonight
20-12-2019T17:02:38,HoverdudeXL,Hello

20-12-2019T17:06:13,TeapotOfDoom,What'cha doing with the mic?
20-12-2019T17:06:32,SageSaga,well the Yeti is broken - i got a new mic in the mail today
20-12-2019T17:06:48,Werewing,"Those dang yetis, being abominable all the time."
20-12-2019T17:06:54,TeapotOfDoom,Thx for the stream and all the best for the surgery thing
20-12-2019T17:07:14,SageSaga,thanks- still not sure what time it is happening- they wont answer the phone T_T

20-12-2019T21:23:39,SpazztasticKiwi,"the fridge attacked me, both my cats got under my feet then split into opposite directions and my foot landed inches from a loaded mouse trap"
