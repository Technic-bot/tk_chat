11-01-2019T00:09:33,SageSaga,Alright- time to move on to comic then
11-01-2019T00:11:05,Ordithus,Great job!
11-01-2019T00:14:20,Dadrobit,"Oof, looks like Maddie had a bad day on Tom's stream."
11-01-2019T00:15:00,Ordithus,Oh no :ctwokinds-LauraCry:
11-01-2019T00:15:14,Dadrobit,Forums are gonna love the full page when that gets done.
11-01-2019T00:16:08,Dadrobit,Buncha psychopaths that they are.
11-01-2019T00:17:41,Ordithus,Speaking of which... dayum Nyna this week :csagesaga-nynasmirk:
11-01-2019T00:17:44,Ordithus,Brutal
11-01-2019T00:18:07,CrRAR,Killtrocity!
11-01-2019T00:19:36,CrRAR,"Indeed robit, many will ask themselves... ""Is this real life?"" ;_;"
11-01-2019T00:20:12,CrRAR,"Poor Karen too, that one way to conclude a childhood."
11-01-2019T00:20:18,Dadrobit,Not even being facetious. There's been a legitimate spate of hate drawn towards Maddie in the last few pages.
11-01-2019T00:20:33,Ordithus,Whaat
11-01-2019T00:21:11,Dadrobit,"""anyone else kinda hoping maddie ATLEAST ends up with some broken legs?"""
11-01-2019T00:21:58,CrRAR,"Ohhh nooo, lol I guess I've been absent to the latest page discussion."
11-01-2019T00:22:11,Ordithus,People just want to see the cute hurt :ptv-whiny:
11-01-2019T00:23:02,CrRAR,Freaky statue hallway takes no prisoners.
11-01-2019T00:23:31,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I tend to stay away from the forums in the last year or so. It's very unchecked against bullshit posters."
11-01-2019T00:24:06,Dadrobit,"""Maddie and Karen have no further use."" ""HAHAHAHAHA... TWO KIDS GON' DIE TONIGHT! :twisted:  this is what you get."""
11-01-2019T00:24:12,SageSaga,did yall see the person behind the Castlevania anime is trying to get the rights to do Berserk?
11-01-2019T00:24:24,Dadrobit,I would endorse that wholeheartedly
11-01-2019T00:32:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom go off to catch drug influenced zzzs?
11-01-2019T00:33:26,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve been only half paying attention
11-01-2019T00:34:14,TheBeckoner,Yea I think he was sick
11-01-2019T00:39:58,SageSaga,So in our Super Hero Pen and Paper RPG - we had our alien invasion
11-01-2019T00:40:39,Ordithus,Why do the aliens always invade Earth.
11-01-2019T00:41:02,MarvTheHugPharaoh,chocolate
11-01-2019T00:41:03,SageSaga,well these aliens invade everything- Earth wasnt the first so-
11-01-2019T00:41:28,SageSaga,perhaps you are just more used to Earth being invaded because you are from earth?
11-01-2019T00:41:51,Ordithus,"I am from Earth, yes.  Definitely"
11-01-2019T00:42:00,Ordithus,Not from Jupiter.  Nope
11-01-2019T00:42:04,SageSaga,you have an earth Bias
11-01-2019T00:42:15,MarvTheHugPharaoh,earth or bust
11-01-2019T00:42:44,Dadrobit,There's a Uranus joke in there somewhere.
11-01-2019T00:42:54,SpazztasticKiwi,What if Mars was our planet but we destroyed it so Adam and Eve were sent on a pod to Earth and that‚Äôs the meteorite that killed the dinosaurs and why Mars shows signs of water
11-01-2019T00:43:05,SageSaga,So - with help from another alien race we were prepared for their first attack- where they just launch thousands of nukes from space...
11-01-2019T00:43:24,SageSaga,i saw that Meme Spazz
11-01-2019T00:44:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Funny theory ain‚Äôt it
11-01-2019T00:44:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Holy like Swiss cheese though
11-01-2019T00:45:12,SageSaga,after the nuke attack failed- they came down to fight- biggest mistake they ever made
11-01-2019T00:45:57,SpazztasticKiwi,"I wonder how aliens would fare on earth. Sure, they‚Äôd have us to go through but would they be prepared for the animals and diseases"
11-01-2019T00:46:08,Ordithus,"""Sir, they've fended off our massive WMD strike that should have wiped every microbe!"" ""Send in the foot soldiers!"""
11-01-2019T00:46:23,SageSaga,Well like i said- this was a Super Hero game- there were super powered humans all over the world
11-01-2019T00:46:30,Bgrmystr2,"if aliens had the technology to come to earth, I don't think there's literally anything on our planet that would interest them."
11-01-2019T00:46:34,Ordithus,"What if, we'll be the invading aliens :ptv-excited:"
11-01-2019T00:46:56,SageSaga,:( yall dont wanna hear my story
11-01-2019T00:47:14,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúTake me to your leader‚Äù ‚ÄúAre you REALLY sure you wanna do that?‚Äù
11-01-2019T00:47:22,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm listening
11-01-2019T00:47:22,SageSaga,i'll just finish my work
11-01-2019T00:47:33,Ordithus,"Fine, I'll listen and stop saying silly tings :P"
11-01-2019T00:47:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm also sidetracked with another conversation
11-01-2019T00:48:17,Ordithus,So what happened :ptv-ohmy:
11-01-2019T00:49:05,SageSaga,they started entering the atmosphere- and just as they did that - they entered my range... O_O
11-01-2019T00:49:21,SpazztasticKiwi,üí•
11-01-2019T00:49:36,Ordithus,"What is your superpower, again?"
11-01-2019T00:50:00,SageSaga,"I was like ""Are they within 100 miles?"" GM- ""Uhh- well they are just starting to enter the atmosphere-"" ""So you are saying... yes!"" ""Yes"" ""I want to hack them O_O"""
11-01-2019T00:50:09,SageSaga,My character controls electrons
11-01-2019T00:51:27,SageSaga,"he's mastered this ability to grant him the abilities to Broadcast, interface with technology, give himself super speed, become intangible by making himself use quantum shifting- and he can make his brain function faster than normal"
11-01-2019T00:52:18,SageSaga,im really big on having one power- and finding ways to make something that most people consider rather mundane- amazing through the application of SCIENCE
11-01-2019T00:52:55,Ordithus,"World breaking, plz nerf"
11-01-2019T00:53:56,SageSaga,"So he was like ""Its an alien system so its going to be very hard"" ""I rolled a 20 on a D6"" ""Well you hack them- what do you do?"" ""Shut down their engines"" and i caused 1 to crash immediately - and it rolled so poor on its attempt to regain control- it"
11-01-2019T00:54:12,SageSaga,ran into one of the other alien ships on the way down
11-01-2019T00:55:01,TheBeckoner,nice
11-01-2019T00:55:04,Ordithus,You made quick work of those 2
11-01-2019T00:55:20,SpazztasticKiwi,When you try and get double
11-01-2019T00:55:37,Mihari,"I liked my one power of TK, that was blast, playing gold with battlecruisters ftw"
11-01-2019T00:55:57,SageSaga,after that the others landed and released ground troops and insect like tanks
11-01-2019T00:56:36,SageSaga,the tank fired at us injuring 3 people in our party-  I was in the middle of the blast but I was intangible so---
11-01-2019T00:57:04,SageSaga,I then ran inside of it and started just electrocuting everything causing it to go haywire.
11-01-2019T00:57:40,SageSaga,My friend ran over to it and began to punch it and destroy it- he has a really cool character
11-01-2019T00:58:05,SageSaga,hes really strong but not like superman strong- like he can lift a small car
11-01-2019T00:58:34,SageSaga,but he also has 2 duplicates of himself- hes also crazy and they all think they are seperate people- they just hang out inside the same body XD
11-01-2019T00:59:06,SageSaga,"so they are like 3 brothers all with the same powers- Flight, Strength, Durability, Regeneration- and he doesnt age or sleep"
11-01-2019T00:59:55,SageSaga,anyways- the other injured members of the group try to take cover and heal before fighting-
11-01-2019T01:00:25,SageSaga,i run out of the wreckage and over to a bunch of the alien soldiers and fire a cone of electricity
11-01-2019T01:01:02,Ordithus,That'll ruin their day
11-01-2019T01:01:28,SageSaga,. . . I did 50 damage to them all. They were all vaporized along with part of a building
11-01-2019T01:02:34,SageSaga,"just so you know- 50 damage in this game is like-  assume that 4 damage is enough to injure you badly, 8 will bring you near death- and 12 is pretty much you are dead in one hit"
11-01-2019T01:03:23,Ordithus,No kill like overkill O_o
11-01-2019T01:03:58,SageSaga,"yeeeeah- one of my friends was like ""How are you the murder machine?! Your power is to run fast and play with computers!"""
11-01-2019T01:05:57,SageSaga,we dealt with the others left- one tried to run away but my friend with the Clones... ran him down - pinned him to the ground and the other 2 clones just beat him to death with objects they found lying around
11-01-2019T01:07:03,SageSaga,So we cleared our area (each group of heroes and soldiers had a section of the city to defend - then once it was clear we had to move to the next zone till we pushed them all back
11-01-2019T01:08:17,SageSaga,"we ended it running to the next group with the people on the radio being like ""Wait- you already wiped out the invaders in your area? I thought your team was rank C"" and my friend was like ""DO NOT MAKE CASTER ANGRY! HE SHOOTS LIGHTNING APPARENTLY!"""
11-01-2019T01:08:40,Ordithus,haha
11-01-2019T01:09:40,SageSaga,I have a reputation as being a super nice nerdy guy in the game- oh - hes also Canadian- but most of the people are- it takes place in Canada
11-01-2019T01:11:32,SageSaga,"My character is built weird- because i wanted him to be mostly utility- the only way for him to do crazy attacks - is to use what they call ""Power Stunts"""
11-01-2019T01:11:39,TheBeckoner,man it just started pourin down rain here
11-01-2019T01:12:19,Ordithus,What is the system you're playing this in?
11-01-2019T01:12:26,SageSaga,Savage Worlds
11-01-2019T01:12:47,Ordithus,"Ah, yes"
11-01-2019T01:13:26,SageSaga,so i can only do these crazy things a few times in a game
11-01-2019T01:13:45,Ordithus,I played a single session of a super SW campaign before the GM moved away
11-01-2019T01:17:09,SpazztasticKiwi,I gotta start gettin to bed
11-01-2019T01:17:15,Ordithus,Is this the same group you play with on Saturdays?
11-01-2019T01:17:28,Ordithus,"Have a good night, Kiwi"
11-01-2019T01:17:35,SageSaga,nope - Local group of friends

11-01-2019T11:05:59,iliar,"Good morning, Tom!"
11-01-2019T11:08:47,iliar,"Tom, you wanted fully automatic gallery because you don't want spend your time to gallery update. It's only reason?"
11-01-2019T11:09:00,Twokinds,yeah
11-01-2019T11:16:02,iliar,There are many problems that cannot be solved automatically. Some posts have more than one image. Some posts should be excluded. Some posts are duplicated on Patreon and Deviantart.
11-01-2019T11:16:08,iliar,I think it will be easier for me to solve these collisions manually. What to do a fully automatic algorithm. And you don‚Äôt have to spend your time anyway.
11-01-2019T11:16:40,Ordithus,<3 :ctwokinds-kingtea:
11-01-2019T11:16:57,Twokinds,"Ah, I didn't think of that."
11-01-2019T11:17:11,Twokinds,That seems way too expensive to do.
11-01-2019T11:18:43,iliar,Most things can be done automatically. The bot is already doing this. But the bot can not solve all the problems.
11-01-2019T11:19:24,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-natsducky:
11-01-2019T11:21:53,iliar,"To be honest, sometimes I think you need to find content manager. Sometimes you forget to post things on Deviantart or do it with a big delay. Some posts on Patreon have not correct tags or have not tags."
11-01-2019T11:23:11,iliar,But probably these sites are not adapted for collective work. And will be very stupid say your password for someone else.
11-01-2019T11:30:22,Ordithus,At least Alexa can remind you to post.  How different is it to post between Patreon and DA?
11-01-2019T11:35:19,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
11-01-2019T11:37:32,Twokinds,Well that's the pain of being a one-man team
11-01-2019T11:40:20,iliar,@Ordithus People who are not patrons can not watch posts NSFW posts on Patreon and can on Deviantart.
11-01-2019T11:40:57,iliar,* watch NSFW posts
11-01-2019T11:41:54,iliar,"Therefore, some posts must be duplicated. That everyone could see them."
11-01-2019T11:42:41,TerraTheWizard,"if you;'re looking for a thing to automate it, there's always postybirb http://www.postybirb.com/"
11-01-2019T11:43:20,Ordithus,DA and Patreon are on that list
11-01-2019T11:43:28,Ordithus,of supported sites
11-01-2019T11:43:28,Twokinds,I've heard of that but I don't trust a third party like that
11-01-2019T11:43:46,TerraTheWizard,ah ok
11-01-2019T11:51:14,iliar,"In this case, I see only one solution. Find a wife and make her content manager."
11-01-2019T11:51:18,Ordithus,They say the application doesn't store login information.  I think Fluff has used it... you could ask him.
11-01-2019T11:51:27,Ordithus,"Or that, iliar haha"

11-01-2019T12:06:02,Tharkis,"ah yeah, plaid is a pita to animate, same with stripes"
11-01-2019T12:06:04,GeneralIrrelevant,Salutations!

11-01-2019T12:16:07,Nekonny,I wonder of shoes would work for digigrade feet?
11-01-2019T12:16:16,Tharkis,should work
11-01-2019T12:16:31,Ordithus,They'd have to be flexible for the toe joints
11-01-2019T12:16:37,CrimsonQuill,Crackers and Smash
11-01-2019T12:16:40,CrimsonQuill,Curry and Mass
11-01-2019T12:16:45,Tharkis,just need to be flexible at the back
11-01-2019T12:16:55,Nekonny,"I mean, ehey are just covering the toes"
11-01-2019T12:17:19,Nekonny,or does that look too wierd?
11-01-2019T12:17:27,Ordithus,Stopping mid-foot looks weird to me
11-01-2019T12:17:28,Twokinds,lol
11-01-2019T12:17:32,Ordithus,Looks uncomfortable
11-01-2019T12:17:51,FFrost,"Probably works, but it looks like they'll slip off rather easily."
11-01-2019T12:17:55,Ordithus,"But that's like, my opinion, man"
11-01-2019T12:18:00,Twokinds,I've always liked the tiny shoes. They look funny.
11-01-2019T12:18:14,Twokinds,XD
11-01-2019T12:18:16,CrimsonQuill,Like the ones Raine wears in that Backstage Banter thing?
11-01-2019T12:18:40,FFrost,They are cute as heck though.
11-01-2019T12:19:07,Twokinds,lol
11-01-2019T12:19:08,Ordithus,Those were slippers
11-01-2019T12:19:19,Twokinds,Yeah or the tiny sandles I always draw for beach scenes.
11-01-2019T12:19:28,Nekonny,Oh yeah XD
11-01-2019T12:19:30,CrimsonQuill,"Yeah, they look xute."

11-01-2019T12:20:43,Tharkis,"those look nice, Ron"
11-01-2019T12:20:52,Ordithus,Steel toe sandals
11-01-2019T12:21:01,Twokinds,The only other alternative I usually use is the Basitin anklets.
11-01-2019T12:21:04,Ordithus,Gotta protect the toes from logs and axes
11-01-2019T12:21:38,Tharkis,"has a sudden urge to sing ""I'm a lumberjack and I'm OK!"""
11-01-2019T12:23:15,CrimsonQuill,Looks at clock and realises that they need dinner before going to mass.
11-01-2019T12:23:18,CrimsonQuill,Bye
11-01-2019T12:23:22,Ordithus,Bye Crimson
11-01-2019T12:23:37,FFrost,I wouldn't be surprised if Tharkis wore suspenders and a bra at this point tbh.
11-01-2019T12:23:44,Tharkis,!!
11-01-2019T12:25:35,iliar,About boots. One of reason why I want Nora Card this sketch - I wan see how will be portal boots looks on Keidran https://www.patreon.com/posts/portal-kat-8584501

11-01-2019T12:26:27,Tharkis,"hrm, i think the baggy pants look too much like harem pants"
11-01-2019T12:26:33,Tharkis,i'd say without baggy pants
11-01-2019T12:26:48,Tharkis,most tree workers dont like baggy clothing anyways =P
11-01-2019T12:26:50,AshtonFinel,Hi
11-01-2019T12:27:09,Nekonny,yeah...
11-01-2019T12:28:03,Nekonny,these shorts still feel odd though
11-01-2019T12:31:11,Tharkis,"y'know what, that miht have been a lot of it, too much fabric wiggle/wave for the size of the shorts"
11-01-2019T12:31:18,Tharkis,look a lot better smoothing it out a bit
11-01-2019T12:31:23,Tharkis,might
11-01-2019T12:35:04,Tharkis,those shorts look good now (imo)
11-01-2019T12:38:10,Nekonny,thanks

11-01-2019T12:39:29,Nekonny,perhaps some gloves?
11-01-2019T12:41:10,Tharkis,"hrm, dont know enough about axe swinging for logging to know if gloves are appropriate or not =D"
11-01-2019T12:43:17,Chalodraws,"Hey Neko, Tharkis"
11-01-2019T12:43:38,Nekonny,heya chalo ^^

11-01-2019T12:44:10,Ordithus,Gloves are very appropriate for axe swinging
11-01-2019T12:44:12,Twokinds,Back from shovelling snow.
11-01-2019T12:44:21,Ordithus,wb from the cold

11-01-2019T12:44:37,Twokinds,Yo Chalo!
11-01-2019T12:44:42,Nekonny,"I wanted to make her more muscular, but I'm having a hard time building mussle mass without the pic looking wonky"
11-01-2019T12:45:38,Tharkis,"she already looks pretty well muscled tbh, i think all you need to do is when shading or whatnot, make sure they're well defined"
11-01-2019T12:45:41,Nekonny,"Tom, sage told me you managed to get a table at AC,"
11-01-2019T12:45:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom why‚Äôre you out shoveling snow when you‚Äôre just sick

11-01-2019T12:53:59,Tharkis,"MFF is nice with the proximity to airport / easy trasnportation, but the con layout itself is kinda dreadful"
11-01-2019T12:54:08,Tharkis,with that half mile walk between the vendor space and the 'con' space
11-01-2019T12:54:33,BadFoMo,Yo.
11-01-2019T12:54:44,Tharkis,"only thing i hate about pittsburg every time i go there for something (work, sports event, etc) is the airport is so damn far from downtown, and there's no public transportation"
11-01-2019T12:54:51,BadFoMo,"Also, what all have I missed."
11-01-2019T12:55:00,Ordithus,Hi FoMo

11-01-2019T15:43:07,SageSaga,My father said he wants a Furry head so he can infiltrate the convention without me knowing hes there

11-01-2019T15:43:52,Mippy,I read Nevernigt by Jay Kristoff
11-01-2019T15:43:55,Bgrmystr2,or just clothes you wouldn't recognise + the head
11-01-2019T15:44:04,SageSaga,My parents are being awesome by taking a road trip up to Pittsburg to drop me and my merch off at the convention
11-01-2019T15:44:12,Ordithus,Sweet
11-01-2019T15:44:14,SageSaga,so i dont have to get a plane ticket or drive all the way on my own
11-01-2019T15:44:14,Tharkis,yeah but then sage's mom would have to go as his 'handler'  =D
11-01-2019T15:44:21,Mippy,Awesome Sages mom
11-01-2019T15:44:23,CrimsonQuill,A US friend of mine lives in Pittsburgh.

11-01-2019T15:44:54,Bgrmystr2,that's like the difference from Orleans to where I lived in GA previously
11-01-2019T15:44:57,Bgrmystr2,that's a long drive
11-01-2019T15:44:59,SageSaga,Plane tickets for me arent so cheap XD
11-01-2019T15:45:10,CrimsonQuill,I can't afford aeroplane tickets
11-01-2019T15:45:17,CrimsonQuill,"Not to the States, definitely"
11-01-2019T15:45:17,Tharkis,"it's ~550 miles driving, which is 9 hours usually"
11-01-2019T15:45:29,Tharkis,but i got round trip 80$ each way
11-01-2019T15:45:30,SageSaga,also i need to take stuff to sell so i need extra luggage
11-01-2019T15:45:36,Mippy,I have no cons to suit to...guess I‚Äôll just be a house puppy üê∂
11-01-2019T15:45:42,Tharkis,"yeah, merch is the killer for conventions"

11-01-2019T15:46:21,CrimsonQuill,Or visit a friend
11-01-2019T15:46:28,Tharkis,but that 9 hours can turn into 11 if you get stuck in traffic
11-01-2019T15:46:34,Tharkis,but it's under a 2 hour flight
11-01-2019T15:46:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Pittsburgh is tofarsville away

11-01-2019T16:51:16,Twokinds,I wonder if they got to pick their own face masks
11-01-2019T16:51:19,sunblaze,not that its gonna help them :D
11-01-2019T16:51:22,Twokinds,Or if they had to color coordinate.

11-01-2019T17:10:37,sunblaze,nyna already did plenty of that
11-01-2019T17:10:57,sunblaze,imho kaylin goes more for the silent stabity stab and choke then pure gore
11-01-2019T17:17:26,SageSaga,Well Kaylin is protecting people- shes not gonna take chances with so many attackers

11-01-2019T17:45:43,sunblaze,hmmm seems kinda cringy with the left by everyone gonna LEVEL-UP plot
11-01-2019T17:45:48,sunblaze,is it at least well done?
11-01-2019T17:47:29,SageSaga,I watched the first episode (Which is actually 2 episodes) enjoyed it so much i started reading the Manga... I read all 50 chapters of it
11-01-2019T17:47:45,SageSaga,in a day
11-01-2019T17:48:02,sunblaze,seems enthralling :D
11-01-2019T17:48:20,SageSaga,it's very good
11-01-2019T17:48:31,SageSaga,its a lot deeper than it looks
11-01-2019T17:49:35,SageSaga,"the main character even says ""Seems kinda cliche"" about the story himself- and once he gets into it- it changes a ton of things up"
11-01-2019T17:51:01,sunblaze,ak ok
11-01-2019T17:51:18,sunblaze,maybe I'll watch those starting episodes to get a better look at it
11-01-2019T17:58:37,SageSaga,and im done-
11-01-2019T17:58:48,SageSaga,which is good cuz i gotta run to the store
11-01-2019T17:58:55,Ordithus,Nice.  Looks like the beginning of some fierce action
11-01-2019T17:59:10,SageSaga,the next page we get into where the cover page comes from :D

11-01-2019T19:43:13,qwe304,"I was going through the archive, and for some reason page 490 was extremely blurry..."
11-01-2019T19:48:18,Twokinds,That's bad...
11-01-2019T19:48:52,Bgrmystr2,not for me?
11-01-2019T19:49:00,Bgrmystr2,looks exactly as it should on my end
11-01-2019T19:50:01,Bgrmystr2,"the speechless page 490 does not match though, so.."
11-01-2019T19:51:51,Bgrmystr2,Apparently the speechless page it thinks is 490 is actually 1013. That subpage needs a rework from the looks of it.
11-01-2019T19:52:26,qwe304,its the same resoloution but blurry
11-01-2019T19:53:50,qwe304,heres what I see https://imgur.com/a/leV9OES
11-01-2019T19:53:59,qwe304,"thats the raw image, not a screencap"
11-01-2019T19:54:17,Bgrmystr2,is that supposed to be blurry?
11-01-2019T19:54:43,qwe304,i mean I go to the next page and its way sharper
11-01-2019T19:55:09,qwe304,also the thumbnail for the most recent page is off
11-01-2019T19:55:21,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno, looks the same sharpness to me."
11-01-2019T19:55:47,qwe304,"ugh, imma go through my old archived images to see if its always been like this"
11-01-2019T19:56:26,Bgrmystr2,Maybe?
11-01-2019T19:56:51,qwe304,gotta find my original images
11-01-2019T19:56:59,qwe304,can only find my upscales atm
11-01-2019T19:57:38,qwe304,and of course those would be a lot sharper
11-01-2019T19:58:32,Combak,"Hey, are folks here?"
11-01-2019T19:59:11,qwe304,a few

11-01-2019T20:00:26,qwe304,huh my image from 1-2 years ago is also blurry
11-01-2019T20:00:42,qwe304,but its definitely blurrier than the other pages
11-01-2019T20:01:10,Combak,"So, what happened with Tom's stream yesterday? It was only an hour?"
11-01-2019T20:01:20,qwe304,think he got sick or somthing
11-01-2019T20:01:21,Bgrmystr2,well on my displays there's no difference between it and the other pages around it
11-01-2019T20:01:25,qwe304,I can check the logs
11-01-2019T20:01:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Apparently Tom feels like death warmed over
11-01-2019T20:01:52,Bgrmystr2,"he couldn't work with the page sketch on the stream, he wasn't satisfied with what he was drawing"
11-01-2019T20:02:00,SpazztasticKiwi,In an old microwave
11-01-2019T20:02:11,Bgrmystr2,but yeah he was also not feeling too hot at the time
11-01-2019T20:02:18,qwe304,https://imgur.com/a/LhAn2aO I can see the difference
11-01-2019T20:02:19,Combak,I see...
11-01-2019T20:02:25,qwe304,its noticeably less sharp
11-01-2019T20:03:11,Bgrmystr2,well yeah that just looks to me like your computer never loaded the left page correctly.
11-01-2019T20:03:19,Combak,"@twokinds, I hope you feel better soon!"
11-01-2019T20:03:22,Combak,Or already! XD
11-01-2019T20:03:37,qwe304,thats the raw 825x1100 image
11-01-2019T20:03:43,qwe304,in both cases
11-01-2019T20:03:55,qwe304,and its the one I geabbed from the archive
11-01-2019T20:04:29,qwe304,its like someone downscaled it by 25% then resized it back
11-01-2019T20:06:36,qwe304,looks fine in the physical  ofc
11-01-2019T20:06:55,Twokinds,The book version is different from the online version
11-01-2019T20:07:05,qwe304,yeah but just wanted to make sure
11-01-2019T20:07:24,qwe304,can you see the difference?
11-01-2019T20:07:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Why did I read that in a Dora voice
11-01-2019T20:08:06,Bgrmystr2,Who runs the speechless page? Turiel?
11-01-2019T20:08:16,qwe304,probably
11-01-2019T20:08:33,Twokinds,Oh I see why. The original was missing. I'll work on getting a replacement
11-01-2019T20:09:08,qwe304,nice to know there was actually somthing off and it wasnt my eyes screwing with me :joy:
11-01-2019T20:09:16,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
11-01-2019T20:11:12,SpazztasticKiwi,You guys wanna know how I entertained myself yesterday
11-01-2019T20:15:32,TheBeckoner,sure
11-01-2019T20:17:59,SpazztasticKiwi,I rewatched the Korean candy video but only read the chat. Not sure which point is my favorite
11-01-2019T20:20:18,TheBeckoner,Korean candy video?
11-01-2019T20:20:26,TheBeckoner,I am not familiar
11-01-2019T20:21:05,Bgrmystr2,mark made a video of eating candy from Korea while him and tom were visiting family there.
11-01-2019T20:21:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah that
11-01-2019T20:21:48,SpazztasticKiwi,The amount of mass confusion when Tom showed was astonishing
11-01-2019T20:22:33,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúHe has a brother?‚Äù ‚ÄúWait is his name Thomas or Jason?‚Äù ‚ÄúIs this why TwoKinds was delayed‚Äù
11-01-2019T20:22:44,Bgrmystr2,I don't recall there being a chat in that video at all.
11-01-2019T20:22:55,Bgrmystr2,"it was just a video on youtube, wasn't it?"
11-01-2019T20:22:56,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúBrother? I thought that was his dad‚Äù
11-01-2019T20:23:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Yea but it was a premier
11-01-2019T20:23:26,Bgrmystr2,":ptv-wondering: ""premier"""
11-01-2019T20:23:33,SpazztasticKiwi,It broadcasted live as an edited video so everyone could react as it played
11-01-2019T20:24:13,Bgrmystr2,I.. don't know? I only know videos and live streams on youtube
11-01-2019T20:24:21,Bgrmystr2,I dunno what even that is.
11-01-2019T20:24:42,SpazztasticKiwi,You can see a replay of it if you rewatch the video
11-01-2019T20:24:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Mark even shows up a few times
11-01-2019T20:25:24,Bgrmystr2,uh.. nope
11-01-2019T20:25:30,Bgrmystr2,it's literally JUST a video
11-01-2019T20:25:38,Bgrmystr2,and the comments below it.
11-01-2019T20:25:43,SpazztasticKiwi,It may be for members only then
11-01-2019T20:25:58,qwe304,I dont think youtube premiere videos were a thing at that point
11-01-2019T20:26:16,Bgrmystr2,Youtube red members you mean? lol
11-01-2019T20:26:24,qwe304,but you can link me the vid and Ill check it
11-01-2019T20:26:29,Bgrmystr2,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNEC8VvqEwk
11-01-2019T20:26:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"But the point is, I‚Äôm not sure if people were just out of the loop or thrown for a loop"
11-01-2019T20:27:03,qwe304,yeup theres a chat replay
11-01-2019T20:27:07,Bgrmystr2,"Well I'm on the video atm and see nothing, so I'm unconvinced. Maybe kiwi sees text in her head. :ptv-wondering:"
11-01-2019T20:27:29,qwe304,looks like this https://imgur.com/a/7mWcy5p

11-01-2019T20:28:10,Bgrmystr2,it just loaded the same page I'm on now
11-01-2019T20:28:26,Bgrmystr2,it's just a normal shortened youtube link
11-01-2019T20:28:30,Bgrmystr2,nothin special about it lol
11-01-2019T20:28:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Members only thing then

11-01-2019T20:29:04,SpazztasticKiwi,YouTube broken. What else is new
11-01-2019T20:29:20,Boxthefox,"top right under log in,there is a button to show it"
11-01-2019T20:29:28,Bgrmystr2,¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø rip youtube
11-01-2019T20:29:54,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm also on mobile so chat replay often starts automatically
11-01-2019T20:30:15,SpazztasticKiwi,As annoying as it is. Gotta close it before it becomes the monster it is
11-01-2019T20:30:17,Bgrmystr2,sec
11-01-2019T20:30:36,Bgrmystr2,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/250139544517607424/533820034632646656/firefox_2019-01-12_19-30-30.png here. there's literally nothing there.
11-01-2019T20:30:39,Bgrmystr2,That's what I see
11-01-2019T20:30:56,Bgrmystr2,"no text, no button, no live chat, nothing."
11-01-2019T20:31:05,Bgrmystr2,Just.. nothing.
11-01-2019T20:32:22,Boxthefox,"wow, weird"
11-01-2019T20:32:34,Bgrmystr2,story of my life :V
11-01-2019T20:32:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Doesn‚Äôt seem to show for desktop mode
11-01-2019T20:32:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Just looked
11-01-2019T20:33:26,SpazztasticKiwi,But man
11-01-2019T20:33:49,SpazztasticKiwi,One of my favorite comments was ‚Äúhe looks like Johnny Depp‚Äù
11-01-2019T20:35:43,qwe304,I'd take that as a compliment
11-01-2019T20:36:03,SpazztasticKiwi,"But other than the confusion and marks insistence in chat for everyone to clap, there was some sweet comments"
11-01-2019T20:36:42,qwe304,wait kiwi are you the real kiwi?
11-01-2019T20:36:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Johnny Depp is freakin 55
11-01-2019T20:37:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Admittedly still nice looking tho yea
11-01-2019T20:37:18,SpazztasticKiwi,What real Kiwi
11-01-2019T20:37:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm American
11-01-2019T20:37:57,qwe304,theres a rather well known person that goes by kiwi
11-01-2019T20:38:10,qwe304,relatively well known in the comunity
11-01-2019T20:38:54,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm known to few people. I do odd drawings
11-01-2019T20:38:59,SpazztasticKiwi,But I doubt it
11-01-2019T20:39:24,SpazztasticKiwi,As for ‚Äúthe community‚Äù you‚Äôll have to be more specific
11-01-2019T20:39:34,qwe304,people that read TK
11-01-2019T20:39:57,SpazztasticKiwi,I figured Kiwi was Steddy‚Äôs nickname
11-01-2019T20:40:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"But since I‚Äôve only been around for like a yearish, not likely"
11-01-2019T20:40:34,qwe304,noted
11-01-2019T20:41:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I have enough unwanted attention than what being popular gives. And being popular doesn‚Äôt ring with me too well
11-01-2019T20:42:15,SpazztasticKiwi,"If I‚Äôm known by any kind of group, I‚Äôve never noticed"
11-01-2019T20:57:18,Bgrmystr2,"Phoenix is A kiwi, one who would be legitimately IRL a kiwi, as where he lives, but is not nicknamed as such"
11-01-2019T20:57:36,Bgrmystr2,"while kiwi here is not actually a kiwi like phoenix is, ironically still called as such though :P"
11-01-2019T20:58:17,Bgrmystr2,I'm fairly sure qwe is talking about a different kiwi in neon's tk server on discord
11-01-2019T20:58:56,Bgrmystr2,Probably ThunderVolt if I had to guess.
11-01-2019T21:01:21,Bgrmystr2,and I don't know if Thundervolt being 'popular in the community is entirely accurate as neon's server is just one server of many and does not remotely represent the community as a whole.
11-01-2019T21:57:29,SpazztasticKiwi,So are you doing any better than yesterday Tom
