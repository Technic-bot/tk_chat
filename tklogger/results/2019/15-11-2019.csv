15-11-2019T01:04:37,JeremySenpai,Considering I plan to travel and meet certain streamers this is a regular thought pattern

15-11-2019T01:07:20,SpazztasticKiwi,nope not at all
15-11-2019T01:07:33,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Not even Tom knows about TK
15-11-2019T01:07:43,SageSaga,"""You must be Tom's little brother Mat!"""
15-11-2019T01:07:51,SpazztasticKiwi,yeah he’s doing this in his sleep
15-11-2019T01:08:02,TheFreindlyDeathclaw,:ctwokinds-floAAA:
15-11-2019T01:08:50,SageSaga,of course he knows- he started going to cons by helping Tom at Comicon before he was popular
15-11-2019T01:09:42,Ordithus,Pretty sure there are pictures of him with a GIANT Flora in the background
15-11-2019T01:09:50,SpazztasticKiwi,I didn’t know Tom existed till Mark mentioned him
15-11-2019T01:10:04,SpazztasticKiwi,3-4 years ago
15-11-2019T01:10:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Didn't start watching mark till after I found TK
15-11-2019T01:10:23,Stormagedon,I didn't know Mark was his bro until last week
15-11-2019T01:10:35,CrimsonHelsing,"was the other way around for me, Kiwi"
15-11-2019T01:10:37,AnuSekaniArt,I learned through a friend of mine who mentioned it back in...2014 I think?
15-11-2019T01:10:47,CrimsonHelsing,that was of course back in the late 2000s
15-11-2019T01:10:48,AnuSekaniArt,Then I remember Mark mentioning Tom and TwoKinds in a video a while back
15-11-2019T01:10:55,AnuSekaniArt,Just never read the comic until a few months ago
15-11-2019T01:11:02,AnuSekaniArt,And I hate that I didn't read it earlier XD
15-11-2019T01:11:29,CrRAR,no regerts
15-11-2019T01:11:43,TheFreindlyDeathclaw,I joined cause of FluffKevlar arts
15-11-2019T01:11:44,Stormagedon,Was that one of his vlogs Anu?
15-11-2019T01:11:53,AnuSekaniArt,It was actually one of his game videos
15-11-2019T01:12:00,AnuSekaniArt,I forget which one though
15-11-2019T01:12:09,AnuSekaniArt,Mark helped me get through the early college days XD
15-11-2019T01:12:19,Stormagedon,oh dang
15-11-2019T01:12:24,SpazztasticKiwi,there’s plenty of convention pictures of both of em
15-11-2019T01:12:54,SageSaga,So Deathclaw- you know me from Fluffs art too?
15-11-2019T01:13:17,TheFreindlyDeathclaw,yeah
15-11-2019T01:13:34,SageSaga,"i was expecting a ""Who are you?"""
15-11-2019T01:14:28,TheFreindlyDeathclaw,but that would make me look like a jerk...
15-11-2019T01:14:39,ZRO4825,:thinking: Should get Fluff to draw Toyoko :joy:
15-11-2019T01:14:44,SageSaga,<_<

15-11-2019T01:14:59,ZRO4825,He DOES draw SFW stuff too. :P
15-11-2019T01:15:01,SageSaga,he already drew Nyna
15-11-2019T01:15:02,Ordithus,:ptv-ohmy:
15-11-2019T01:15:18,ZRO4825,And yesh. I remember the Nyna.

15-11-2019T01:17:09,CrRAR,senses: piqued
15-11-2019T01:18:03,SpazztasticKiwi,I got to hear Christmas music start at work today
15-11-2019T01:18:14,SpazztasticKiwi,one song played 3 times
15-11-2019T01:18:17,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-clovisgirl_shake:
15-11-2019T01:18:19,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Its not even thanks giving yet
15-11-2019T01:18:25,TheFreindlyDeathclaw,:ctwokinds-sleepoverA:
15-11-2019T01:18:26,SpazztasticKiwi,I was there only 5 hours
15-11-2019T01:18:32,SageSaga,sorry to hear that Kiwi
15-11-2019T01:18:59,CrRAR,let the festive flow through you~
15-11-2019T01:19:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Not until the 27th
15-11-2019T01:19:15,SpazztasticKiwi,“12 days of Christmas” started and I swear you could’ve heard my spirit crack
15-11-2019T01:19:19,AspiringNoodle,It's only a matter of time before my job does the same O_O
15-11-2019T01:19:27,MarvTheHugPharaoh,29th even
15-11-2019T01:19:43,SageSaga,we usually dont put up the Christmas tree until Thanksgiving day
15-11-2019T01:19:47,steelabjur,"Back, had to go do some laundry. ;p"
15-11-2019T01:19:57,SageSaga,but my mother already put up the Crab Pot Tree...
15-11-2019T01:20:05,CrimsonHelsing,and that's on the... 28th?
15-11-2019T01:20:41,Ordithus,28th yeah
15-11-2019T01:21:16,steelabjur,I usually wait until the day after Thanksgiving before going Christmas Crazy.
15-11-2019T01:22:04,SageSaga,little surprised no one has asked what the heck a crab pot tree is
15-11-2019T01:22:17,CrimsonHelsing,"actually, I was wondering about that"
15-11-2019T01:22:19,TheFreindlyDeathclaw,Watching strim is  chill  :ctwokinds-natsducky:
15-11-2019T01:22:20,Ordithus,Maybe I don't want to know :crab:
15-11-2019T01:22:51,SageSaga,it's a christmas tree made out of crab pots/traps
15-11-2019T01:22:54,SpazztasticKiwi,I work retail - I’m not surprised by anything
15-11-2019T01:23:05,CrimsonHelsing,ohhh
15-11-2019T01:23:11,SpazztasticKiwi,and it’s taught me you don’t always want answers
15-11-2019T01:23:30,CrimsonHelsing,sounds like something you'd find at docks in places like Bar Harbor in Maine
15-11-2019T01:23:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"rather, little surprises me"
15-11-2019T01:23:35,steelabjur,"Huh, I was expecting a tree IN a crab pot, not made of them."
15-11-2019T01:23:36,CrRAR,"yes, some question best left mysteries~"
15-11-2019T01:23:48,SageSaga,we live in an area where a lot of people make thier living off of crabbing/fishing
15-11-2019T01:23:57,CrimsonHelsing,east coast?
15-11-2019T01:24:01,SageSaga,yep
15-11-2019T01:24:28,SageSaga,so when the traps break they cut em up - and turn them into art when they can
15-11-2019T01:25:25,SageSaga,they became popular enough you can just buy one made out of the material without having once been actual crap pots
15-11-2019T01:25:33,CrimsonHelsing,"clever, always a use for everything"
15-11-2019T01:25:35,steelabjur,Natani looks like she's listening in to the conversation around her.
15-11-2019T01:26:09,Ordithus,Natani would understand very little
15-11-2019T01:26:10,InTheLionsDen,Not unless they are all speaking Keidran.
15-11-2019T01:26:20,Ordithus,But he can try
15-11-2019T01:26:28,steelabjur,Which all present speak.
15-11-2019T01:26:37,CrimsonHelsing,sans Trace
15-11-2019T01:26:48,CrimsonHelsing,his is very rusty
15-11-2019T01:26:48,TheFreindlyDeathclaw,keith should teach him
15-11-2019T01:26:50,steelabjur,"True, forgot that."
15-11-2019T01:26:54,Ordithus,"Mike's Keidran is pretty bad, too"
15-11-2019T01:27:32,CrimsonHelsing,"would be nice, Deathclaw"
15-11-2019T01:27:40,SageSaga,"I want Trace to ask Keith what <#%$%#@> means and hes like ""Flora has a dirty mouth!"""
15-11-2019T01:27:52,CrimsonHelsing,lmao!

15-11-2019T01:28:51,AnuSekaniArt,XD
15-11-2019T01:28:57,steelabjur,Maybe Flora is saying something in Keidran because she knows Trace wouldn't know and that's why she's looking so smug?
15-11-2019T01:29:10,CrimsonHelsing,lol
15-11-2019T01:33:18,steelabjur,"Red: ""Is it wrong that I find her hotter with fur?"""

15-11-2019T02:09:59,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nyna has some of the best expressions
15-11-2019T02:10:32,Sclimshady,^
15-11-2019T02:10:42,AnuSekaniArt,Agreed ^^
15-11-2019T02:10:59,SageSaga,Nyna doesnt generally hide her feelings- Kaylin is an expert in it
15-11-2019T02:11:59,Sclimshady,She does it very adorably
15-11-2019T02:13:08,Dadrobit,Howdy y'all
15-11-2019T02:13:14,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi daddy
15-11-2019T02:13:17,SageSaga,yo Dadrobit
15-11-2019T02:13:23,Sclimshady,Hi Dad o/
15-11-2019T02:13:36,steelabjur,"Howdy, Dadrobit"
15-11-2019T02:15:08,Dadrobit,"Rough night, shift can't end soon enough. Still 5 more hours..."
15-11-2019T02:17:12,AnuSekaniArt,Hang in there Robit!
15-11-2019T02:17:26,steelabjur,"That sucks, but hey, some of us are still here if you want to vent!"
15-11-2019T02:17:34,DarthRexKing,This sounds like. RWBY music. o3o
15-11-2019T02:19:00,Dadrobit,"Bah, just a buncha horseshit today. Broken Gates and impudent, disrespectful guards."
15-11-2019T02:19:14,SageSaga,a lot of my music is from RWBY
15-11-2019T02:19:29,SageSaga,well- it used to make up like 40% of my music on stream XD
15-11-2019T02:19:41,Dadrobit,"Moreso I'm pissed about the guards, but my gate being busted is a heckuva cherry on top."
15-11-2019T02:19:42,SageSaga,not so much anymore since i switched to Spotify
15-11-2019T02:20:03,Twokinds,Hang in there!
15-11-2019T02:21:18,Dadrobit,"Thanks kindly. I've got the upper management and the HOA on my side of this crap, but it's gonna be annoying until the morning guards figure out how to extract their heads from their asses."
15-11-2019T02:21:45,Sclimshady,Very painfully it would seem
15-11-2019T02:21:54,steelabjur,I hate dealing with those types.
15-11-2019T02:22:08,Dadrobit,I read their cranial rectosis is terminal.
15-11-2019T02:22:14,Dadrobit,Fear*
15-11-2019T02:23:42,steelabjur,Cook the shift a bunch of beans and wait for nature to take it's course?
15-11-2019T02:24:36,steelabjur,"Though, from the sounds of it, they're probably the type who like the smell of their own farts. ;p"
15-11-2019T02:25:01,Dadrobit,They'd eat their own shit just to make everyone else smell their breathe.
15-11-2019T02:27:25,steelabjur,"Just can't find good help these days. Reminds me of a friend of mine, constantly having to pull double shifts because the other guards would call in."
15-11-2019T02:27:38,DarthRexKing,Nice sage. :V And take care Dad.
15-11-2019T02:28:59,Dadrobit,"Been there done that, steel"
15-11-2019T02:30:37,steelabjur,"Dude is in his mid-40s, having to cover for 20 somethings. He was so relieved to finally dump that job."
15-11-2019T02:32:11,Dadrobit,"Security is a revolving door of ""talent"""
15-11-2019T02:32:22,AnuSekaniArt,Alright I gotta head out. It's getting late'

15-11-2019T02:44:18,ZRO4825,Nyna can't breathe there. >:3
15-11-2019T02:44:28,Dadrobit,"I wanna come up with a sweet pun for this, but I got nothin'"
