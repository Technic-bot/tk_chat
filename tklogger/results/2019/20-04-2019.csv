20-04-2019T11:14:03,Xexanoth,"the whole: if you have no idea what you'Re doing the enemy doesn't either, doesn't really work in close combat :ptv-confused:"
20-04-2019T11:28:53,FloofyCat,"I wonder if Natani has it in her to actually hit poor Kat, I bet she'd beat Keith/Mike/Evals/Eric/Trace into the ground though."
20-04-2019T11:31:52,FloofyCat,"She'd probably end up making Kat cry and then will feel guilty over it, even Zen would judge, but she'd just point and laugh at the guys once they're face-first into the mud."
20-04-2019T11:32:13,FloofyCat,Hope to see everyone tonight for the stream though \o/ Gunna be fun

20-04-2019T13:52:33,iliar,Tom. I have a question. What do I do with works like this? I mean it would be cool to add them to the gallery. But I do not know how to do this if you do not publish them.
20-04-2019T13:52:46,Twokinds,I am about to post it as a filler

20-04-2019T15:22:32,FloofyCat,If I'll have children I'll cut their faces out of photos and put ref sheet ref sheet in there instead.
20-04-2019T15:22:47,TerraTheWizard,"but yeah, if you can figure out the next trend before it happens you'll probably want to keep that to yourself"
20-04-2019T15:22:51,TerraTheWizard,so you can win a lot
20-04-2019T15:22:59,FloofyCat,Pfffft
20-04-2019T15:23:14,FloofyCat,Everyone knows that Natani + Keith is the eternal trend.

20-04-2019T15:23:17,Twokinds,Uh...
20-04-2019T15:23:18,CrimsonQuill,I'm not following a trend at the moment.
20-04-2019T15:23:23,RimaDraws,Lol
20-04-2019T15:23:30,CrimsonQuill,@Twokinds didn't you already do that one?
20-04-2019T15:23:34,FloofyCat,Yeah...
20-04-2019T15:23:35,Twokinds,Yes
20-04-2019T15:23:38,CrimsonQuill,Yep.
20-04-2019T15:23:38,RimaDraws,I‚Äôm only going with a ref because I ran out of raine and Roselyn ideas
20-04-2019T15:23:39,Combak,That's the point
20-04-2019T15:23:52,CrimsonQuill,@RimaDraws I'm going for the same as last week
20-04-2019T15:23:54,TerraTheWizard,only trend i jumped on recently was the laura one
20-04-2019T15:23:56,Twokinds,They're clearly going off the remake from Nat and Keith but... I'm way ahead of them
20-04-2019T15:23:56,CrimsonQuill,"Oh Hullo, Combal"
20-04-2019T15:23:59,CrimsonQuill,Combak

20-04-2019T15:26:34,iliar,I expected someone to suggested a remake of remake of the first kiss. But I didn't expect this to happen so quickly. I thought it would happen in a few years when your style changes again.
20-04-2019T15:26:34,FloofyCat,That was even kinda recent too
20-04-2019T15:26:42,RimaDraws,I remember that picture but I forgot about it

20-04-2019T15:28:33,Twokinds,They might be revisited
20-04-2019T15:28:36,Xexanoth,the continuation will just come from sketch stream requests

20-04-2019T15:29:08,Bgrmystr2,they know who they are.

20-04-2019T15:29:39,TerraTheWizard,can't even get a ghostbuster to get rid of her
20-04-2019T15:29:40,FloofyCat,"I hope Kat isn't going to leave, she's become so close to Natani now"
20-04-2019T15:30:13,CrimsonQuill,"Or Raine, I really want to see her master her magic and prove her mum wrong on Keidran-Human ideas."
20-04-2019T15:31:13,Bgrmystr2,"I mean.. we still get Saria suggestions every once in a while, and we haven't seen her in the comic for how long? lol"
20-04-2019T15:31:26,RimaDraws,Because she‚Äôs dead ?
20-04-2019T15:31:28,Bgrmystr2,there was that one image in the manor hallway and that was basically it
20-04-2019T15:31:33,Dadrobit,"I mean, at least Mike and Evals serve the least amount of plot progression, so they're probably gonna be the easiest to discontinue."
20-04-2019T15:31:34,Bgrmystr2,yeah and we still get suggestions of her
20-04-2019T15:31:34,MarvTheHugPharaoh,she became a painting
20-04-2019T15:31:46,TerraTheWizard,lol
20-04-2019T15:31:52,Bgrmystr2,so I don't think anyone leaving will ever truely go xD
20-04-2019T15:31:53,RimaDraws,That‚Äôs gonna be a heartbreaker honestly with mike and ev
20-04-2019T15:32:10,Dadrobit,"Eh, they're pretty self contained with each other."
20-04-2019T15:32:17,RimaDraws,It really got me in the feels when they had that conversation
20-04-2019T15:32:39,BluePhantom90,Well Happy Easter today everyone
20-04-2019T15:32:41,FloofyCat,"I can manage Mike and Evals because they never really stuck out much, but I'm going to miss Kat & Eric."
20-04-2019T15:32:48,CrimsonQuill,And you to BluePhantom
20-04-2019T15:32:52,FloofyCat,And I'm not sure why Keith or Natani would stay
20-04-2019T15:32:59,Dadrobit,Kat in particular's gonna be rough to get rid of.
20-04-2019T15:33:08,Dadrobit,'Specially if unsteddy's around
20-04-2019T15:33:12,RimaDraws,Kat well she won‚Äôt be rid of easily no
20-04-2019T15:33:16,Dadrobit,And Neon
20-04-2019T15:33:17,CrimsonQuill,War is coming...I fear that not all the goodbyes will be peaceful.
20-04-2019T15:33:24,NeonMitsumi,I am watching.
20-04-2019T15:33:29,TerraTheWizard,"yeah, i'm still not sure which group kat would go with"
20-04-2019T15:33:29,Dadrobit,lol
20-04-2019T15:33:47,Bgrmystr2,probably where Eric goes.
20-04-2019T15:33:53,CrimsonQuill,I fear for the character's futures....I care about them...
20-04-2019T15:33:54,Dadrobit,IMHO? She should be left to her own devices.
20-04-2019T15:34:02,Dadrobit,Apart from Group A or B
20-04-2019T15:34:18,FloofyCat,"Yeah, Kat would be kinda useful too, if they're all travelling it'll be good to have someone to cook and all. I dunno if Kat would want to go with Eric or not though."
20-04-2019T15:34:26,CrimsonQuill,I think groups A and B are going to merge somehow.
20-04-2019T15:34:51,Bgrmystr2,"She likes Eric, so it would make sense for her to want to stay with him. Whether it happens, I dunno."
20-04-2019T15:34:59,Dadrobit,"She's part and parcel of the Na'Rella crew, and if she were to continue with the main cast it'd just be character bloat."
20-04-2019T15:35:26,Aimbotexe,"I think Eric will leave Kat with the main cast to ""set her free"""
20-04-2019T15:35:41,FloofyCat,"Well the Na'Rella had its... problem, Evals and Mike are understandably going to their families."
20-04-2019T15:36:24,FloofyCat,"Eric I'm not sure, it's more or less if Kat wants to stick with Eric for a boring love with Mr. ""You're like a sister to me"" or if she wants to go with the cool kids."
20-04-2019T15:36:51,CrimsonHelsing,@TwoKinds all I can say is I'm really hoping there's a way they can all throw Brahn off their tails. Gets on my nerves when a persistent enemy has spies everywhere.
20-04-2019T15:37:09,Bgrmystr2,prolly won't.
20-04-2019T15:37:14,Bgrmystr2,he's persistant after all
20-04-2019T15:37:23,CrimsonQuill,@CrimsonHelsing isn't that what happens in reality though?

20-04-2019T15:37:44,Twokinds,Things will be coming to a head soon

20-04-2019T16:35:16,MrMongMong,True.
20-04-2019T16:35:25,Dimensional,Yeah.. I wonder if someone suggested a Nibbly Ref Sheet.
20-04-2019T16:35:27,Twokinds,There's only so many that can be made before we run out of characters.
20-04-2019T16:35:29,LuckyMan,Yeah
20-04-2019T16:35:37,Mippy,Agree. Can sample colours instead of guessing
20-04-2019T16:35:37,CrimsonQuill,True that.
20-04-2019T16:35:47,InTheLionsDen,Then the redraw cycle starts.
20-04-2019T16:35:53,JimMcDuff,Will probably end up with like 20 ref sheets.  Out of those 19 will get coloured.
20-04-2019T16:35:58,CrimsonQuill,"Is this a reference sheet, though?"
20-04-2019T16:36:01,MrMongMong,"Well, if the Sam and Colin arc comes to pass, many new ones will be needed."
20-04-2019T16:36:03,Sclimshady,We need a ref sheet for every background character

20-04-2019T16:36:12,Aimbotexe,Never the Laura ref tho

20-04-2019T16:38:55,CrimsonQuill,Dragon probably
20-04-2019T16:39:10,CrimsonQuill,I want to see the masks-all of them-lose their power.
20-04-2019T16:39:11,FloofyCat,I'm convinced Red isn't just... Red.

20-04-2019T18:31:03,CrimsonQuill,"As in, half midnight"
20-04-2019T18:31:13,FloofyCat,Maybe his power move was annoying everyone else at the gym?

20-04-2019T19:04:50,FloofyCat,It's probably just in a background tab or something
20-04-2019T19:04:52,Bgrmystr2,or just close the browser app entirely
20-04-2019T19:05:08,FloofyCat,Or turn your WiFi + data off.

20-04-2019T20:19:49,FloofyCat,"Also I wonder if when Trace & Co. leave the mansion, if Trace ends up meeting anyone he f*cked over in his previous life. Kinda like the Chimera character."
20-04-2019T20:20:01,BadFoMo,Hmm?
20-04-2019T20:20:12,Mippy,"Yes, Catz, everything is cannon"
20-04-2019T20:20:23,BadFoMo,That's a cool tool.

20-04-2019T20:23:16,CrRAR,Mask gotta strike while the iron is HOT.
20-04-2019T20:23:21,ElvenHunter84,I'm a little confused as to where the tom picks are coming from this stream
20-04-2019T20:23:21,Twokinds,I used body intentionally
20-04-2019T20:23:23,xcvb,NIKON/10 ;)
20-04-2019T20:23:34,Bgrmystr2,"I love the eye coloring and stuff, you always make the masks look ominous, I love it"

20-04-2019T20:23:38,ElvenHunter84,did these not make it to tkpolls in time?
20-04-2019T20:23:38,CrRAR,"""I don't like this body anywayssss... sooooooo"""
20-04-2019T20:23:40,Twokinds,The masks are just masks. They literally need a body to interact with the physical world.
20-04-2019T20:23:41,Storyteller3010,It's really great.
20-04-2019T20:23:44,FenceEqualizer,"Tch, Mask....they only want you for your body."
20-04-2019T20:23:51,FloofyCat,Can the masks actually fly around though?
20-04-2019T20:24:10,Mippy,He pulled the one he wanted to do beforehand @ElvenHunter84
20-04-2019T20:24:11,Twokinds,Yeah sure
20-04-2019T20:24:19,thestooge2222,Cool lore!
20-04-2019T20:24:19,CrRAR,lol
20-04-2019T20:24:27,CrRAR,*woooshhh*
20-04-2019T20:24:27,FloofyCat,Are they vulnerable whilst flying around?
20-04-2019T20:24:34,Corinthian,I wonder if it's possible to break the masks
20-04-2019T20:24:36,JDH,only to bugs
20-04-2019T20:24:40,xcvb,"I know it's be a mask, but still, Mary @ comicoon talking with Adam Savege"
20-04-2019T20:24:42,FloofyCat,"Yeah, me too."
20-04-2019T20:24:44,CrimsonQuill,Wouldn't they be ethereal?
20-04-2019T20:24:46,vevans0009,Looks cracked.
20-04-2019T20:24:49,Twokinds,Of course
20-04-2019T20:24:51,Aimbotexe,That one eye whole appears so
20-04-2019T20:24:53,Twokinds,Neutral was broken
20-04-2019T20:25:13,unsteddyphoenix,Does she leak now?
20-04-2019T20:25:20,CatzArt,so we can catch the masks with ghost busters technology
20-04-2019T20:25:20,Combak,"So, if they need a body to interact with the physical world... How did they make Keidran, Humans, and Basitins?"
20-04-2019T20:25:23,GamerCent,What is this mask?  Is it neutral?
20-04-2019T20:25:24,Corinthian,I mean like break as in shatter completely.
20-04-2019T20:25:28,Twokinds,They've vulnerable when the body they're in is compromised
20-04-2019T20:25:34,unsteddyphoenix,I dont think they made them
20-04-2019T20:25:47,Twokinds,"They can't be killed, but it takes a while to regen"
20-04-2019T20:25:54,FloofyCat,Somewhat off topic but is Trace actually that well known by Keidran? Is he feared?
20-04-2019T20:25:56,Twokinds,And they can't full possess someone when they're in pieces
20-04-2019T20:25:56,FenceEqualizer,So theoretically could someone be too willful to control and steal the masks power?
20-04-2019T20:26:03,unsteddyphoenix,Can they be trapped in a host?
20-04-2019T20:26:04,JDH,this mask needs some glue and it will be alrigh
20-04-2019T20:26:11,GamerCent,Is is neutral?
20-04-2019T20:26:13,ElvenHunter84,So they're like Gems from SU kinda
20-04-2019T20:26:20,Twokinds,I mean this was a previous suggestion
20-04-2019T20:26:27,ElvenHunter84,"Oh hey, that's mine"
20-04-2019T20:26:27,Twokinds,This is what Neutral's face is now
20-04-2019T20:26:30,FloofyCat,That's pretty spooky.
20-04-2019T20:26:37,vevans0009,Woah

20-04-2019T20:26:45,JDH,that would be a cool wallpaper
20-04-2019T20:26:45,Bgrmystr2,I remember this
20-04-2019T20:26:47,CrimsonQuill,A bleeding eye socket.

20-04-2019T20:27:15,ElvenHunter84,It was my first ever suggestion
20-04-2019T20:27:16,xcvb,This doesent need to be colored
20-04-2019T20:27:18,FloofyCat,Ooooh way before I actively watched streams.

20-04-2019T20:27:42,Mippy,I like to say before I got here

20-04-2019T20:28:31,CatzArt,which race belongs to which mask again?
20-04-2019T20:28:32,FloofyCat,That's a good approach for things Tom
20-04-2019T20:28:33,CrRAR,They just... start a new race.

20-04-2019T20:31:37,FloofyCat,Order is Odo from Star Trek DS9

20-04-2019T20:31:44,Bgrmystr2,cuz the mask would exist
20-04-2019T20:31:46,Twokinds,Chaos wants things to be interesting.
20-04-2019T20:31:50,unsteddyphoenix,I think we can all guess what chaos wants
20-04-2019T20:31:50,CatzArt,Kinda reminds me of the Grey March from the Elderscrolls. Jygallag was the god of order and he wanted to kill everything
20-04-2019T20:31:54,PalmettoPathfinder1,Chaos must go with Humans
20-04-2019T20:31:56,Ellarihan,@GamerCent Oh no! You got me!
20-04-2019T20:32:03,FenceEqualizer,Nora is secretly Chaos confirm.
20-04-2019T20:32:06,Twokinds,"He likes races mixing together, as Trace and co are doing."
20-04-2019T20:32:10,Combak,"I mean, our universe is tending towards chaos, but I don't think he wants that kind of chaos."
20-04-2019T20:32:13,Mippy,Plot Twist: Chaos is the ‚Äúgood‚Äù God
20-04-2019T20:32:19,Bgrmystr2,so.. chaos is winning lol
20-04-2019T20:32:23,tony1695,"Humanity seems to be the most expansionist and exploitative, Chaos makes sense"
20-04-2019T20:32:25,Bgrmystr2,sora.
20-04-2019T20:32:25,Twokinds,"He also likes wars and slavery. But not too much, cause if one side wins it's boring."
20-04-2019T20:32:27,vevans0009,I'm sticking with CHaos.
20-04-2019T20:32:28,Bgrmystr2,sorta* even
20-04-2019T20:32:32,vevans0009,off
20-04-2019T20:32:34,Sclimshady,Chaos always wins
20-04-2019T20:32:37,Aimbotexe,He seems to be the least dickish
20-04-2019T20:32:40,CatzArt,I'll stick to chaos then
20-04-2019T20:32:46,FloofyCat,Chaos still sounds nicer.
20-04-2019T20:32:47,vevans0009,Lesser evil.
20-04-2019T20:32:51,FloofyCat,What does Neutral want?
20-04-2019T20:32:51,PalmettoPathfinder1,Chaos likes slavery.  Boo!
20-04-2019T20:32:52,Bgrmystr2,ahhh ugh why do all these masks have evil parts to them
20-04-2019T20:32:53,CrRAR,lol
20-04-2019T20:32:56,CatzArt,But how evil is Neutral?
20-04-2019T20:33:01,tony1695,"Chaos would not want Order's world-tomb, nothing happening"
20-04-2019T20:33:02,Aimbotexe,He likes slavery? but thats control
20-04-2019T20:33:03,ElvenHunter84,"because no god is perfect, Bgr"
20-04-2019T20:33:06,Dimensional,We are the Anti-Borg. We bring Chaos to Order. Muahahahahaha.
20-04-2019T20:33:06,GamerCent,@Ellarihan )
20-04-2019T20:33:06,FenceEqualizer,Can't have good without evil I suppose?
20-04-2019T20:33:07,Twokinds,They're all kinda good and evil in different ways
20-04-2019T20:33:08,Combak,Perfectly balanced.
20-04-2019T20:33:09,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah Chaos likes wars, Order likes wars with a point"
20-04-2019T20:33:11,Dimensional,Nyuk nyuk nyuk
20-04-2019T20:33:20,Aimbotexe,Slavery is enforced order
20-04-2019T20:33:24,Bgrmystr2,"then they're not true gods, as all gods are 100% perfection"
20-04-2019T20:33:32,Twokinds,Neutral is neurotic. They want everything in their proper place and NEVER CHANGING.
20-04-2019T20:33:32,Bgrmystr2,"not perfect, not true god."
20-04-2019T20:33:35,Combak,They're anime gods.
20-04-2019T20:33:35,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah theyre just demi boys
20-04-2019T20:33:41,Twokinds,They would be happy if time didn't move at all.

20-04-2019T20:33:51,PalmettoPathfinder1,Order goes with the Basitins and he wants to wipe out everyone. Dang.  Makes me wonder if Trace wanted to kill them and take their place when he went power mad
20-04-2019T20:33:53,unsteddyphoenix,"Neutral also wants order, in a way"
20-04-2019T20:34:00,FloofyCat,"So Tom, the Patreon tier where Nibbly shifts stuff by 5 degrees, is that the literal bane of Neutral?"
20-04-2019T20:34:10,Combak,lol
20-04-2019T20:34:12,MrMongMong,Wao
20-04-2019T20:34:12,FenceEqualizer,Which means tilting neutral's paintings is the ultimate revenge.

20-04-2019T20:34:14,Ellarihan,That's why I watch stream. Sometimes I can learn something new about the world of Twokinds.

20-04-2019T20:34:35,Storyteller3010,ha
20-04-2019T20:34:39,FloofyCat,Nibbly is the end-game boss.
20-04-2019T20:34:39,Strongpaw,Squirrel! the 4th mask!
20-04-2019T20:34:41,Twokinds,Neutral hates it when people mess with its toys.
20-04-2019T20:34:48,GamerCent,I re-read comics 3-4 times
20-04-2019T20:34:54,unsteddyphoenix,"""GET OUT OF MY ROOOOM"""
20-04-2019T20:34:57,ElvenHunter84,Nibbly might end up being a Mask in a phsyical body
20-04-2019T20:34:58,tony1695,Hence it coming after Trace and his mission of genocide
20-04-2019T20:35:03,ElvenHunter84,not a dragon after all
20-04-2019T20:35:05,xcvb,but Nora bleps him ^^
20-04-2019T20:35:08,CrimsonQuill,Is it possible to screw over all three masks at the same time?
20-04-2019T20:35:13,Dimensional,Ah. So Neutral hates Nora
20-04-2019T20:35:13,Sclimshady,Neutral emo kid confirmed
20-04-2019T20:35:13,Twokinds,"Order keeps putting everything in rows where they're not supposed to be, and chaos keeps mixing everything up."
20-04-2019T20:35:18,CrimsonQuill,As in piss them all off at once?
20-04-2019T20:35:23,PalmettoPathfinder1,I wonder if the dragons oppose the masks
20-04-2019T20:35:24,Twokinds,There's an order and only ORDER can fix it.
20-04-2019T20:35:37,Aimbotexe,I saw that

20-04-2019T20:35:40,Twokinds,"There's an order and only Neutral can fix it,"
20-04-2019T20:35:40,Mippy,XD
20-04-2019T20:35:43,Storyteller3010,"So order believes in segregation. While chaos in some form of way, believes in mixed existence"
20-04-2019T20:35:47,GamerCent,I saw it too
20-04-2019T20:35:51,Storyteller3010,That's very unique
20-04-2019T20:35:51,Twokinds,Typo
20-04-2019T20:35:55,Combak,"I was about to say, does that mean there's a fourth mask?"
20-04-2019T20:35:56,BadFoMo,Oh...

20-04-2019T20:36:11,Twokinds,"Yeah, there was a fourth mask"
20-04-2019T20:36:12,BadFoMo,I thought it was part of a joke.
20-04-2019T20:36:15,Twokinds,But it doesn't exist anymore
20-04-2019T20:36:21,Storyteller3010,So what's going to happen now Tom?
20-04-2019T20:36:22,BadFoMo,What happened?
20-04-2019T20:36:26,Combak,"Wait, really?"
20-04-2019T20:36:30,tony1695,So... there was a fourth race that got wiped out?

20-04-2019T20:38:45,Aimbotexe,Tom was the 4th mask
20-04-2019T20:38:53,FloofyCat,So don't destroy the masks is the moral of the story?

20-04-2019T20:38:58,unsteddyphoenix,How could it be both at the same time
20-04-2019T20:39:05,MrMongMong,Don't destroy the wrong ones is the moral
20-04-2019T20:39:06,Twokinds,Chaos OR order
20-04-2019T20:39:09,unsteddyphoenix,"Or, would it violently richochet between them"

20-04-2019T20:39:41,Twokinds,I mean it's hard to imagine. Just as the people of Twokinds can't imagine the concept the 4th mask would represent.
20-04-2019T20:39:41,FloofyCat,And what if you destroy all of 'em?
20-04-2019T20:39:42,FenceEqualizer,Later

20-04-2019T22:34:49,TraceLegacyXI,Please don‚Äôt kick me again.
20-04-2019T22:34:52,Dadrobit,The only RP I ever participate in is pretending to be a functional adult.
20-04-2019T22:34:53,GamerCent,I think it‚Äôs longest stream...
20-04-2019T22:34:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I didn‚Äôt get to see the polls
20-04-2019T22:34:56,Bgrmystr2,then please don't RP again xD

20-04-2019T22:35:14,FloofyCat,I didn't even know it was a rule.
20-04-2019T22:35:19,Zakuru,"if @twokinds is still lingering, i kinda wanted to ask what font you use for your jagged sound effects. Where the lettering is all uneven."
20-04-2019T22:35:28,FloofyCat,"Leumas, Teddy will thank you (and so will I)"
20-04-2019T22:35:39,SpazztasticKiwi,They don‚Äôt stick for me since I have to stay in browser for the vote to count

20-04-2019T22:36:43,Dadrobit,Plot twist: She can't quite manage it. Her torso and Jaw stick out too far to manage.

20-04-2019T22:38:28,SpazztasticKiwi,But really it‚Äôd be nice to have a collection and just do them all
20-04-2019T22:38:33,Dadrobit,Have a good one all y'all that are leaving.
20-04-2019T22:38:33,Mippy,Off I go

20-04-2019T22:38:42,BadFoMo,Bye.
20-04-2019T22:38:54,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-ohmy: kiwi
20-04-2019T22:38:58,FenceEqualizer,Could suggest them. Might become a trend for a sec like the WWII stuff
20-04-2019T22:38:58,Bgrmystr2,it's too late
20-04-2019T22:39:07,SamuelLeumas,"ANd she will be fine if things go according to plan, like teasing the viewer..."
20-04-2019T22:39:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Trace is up for his modeling shoot and Floras off to the side being barely contained
20-04-2019T22:40:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I dunno if the guys are as popular as the girls
20-04-2019T22:40:39,unsteddyphoenix,Depends on the girls and the guys
20-04-2019T22:40:53,FenceEqualizer,^ May be harder cause Trace is human
20-04-2019T22:40:53,xcvb,Keith char sheet?
20-04-2019T22:40:53,Bgrmystr2,yeah seems like it depends
20-04-2019T22:40:58,SpazztasticKiwi,At least enough to get one done as a model shoot behind a glass wall thing
20-04-2019T22:41:11,Dadrobit,Alaric is primo model material
20-04-2019T22:41:13,FenceEqualizer,Notice it's harder to get human suggestions through here. /shrug
20-04-2019T22:41:30,Dadrobit,Already models with Basitin Spice.
20-04-2019T22:41:35,xcvb,it can be human...
20-04-2019T22:41:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Even further is the fact my focus for suggestions would be more side characters that aren‚Äôt that popular
20-04-2019T22:41:43,xcvb,... if it bhas boobs
20-04-2019T22:41:45,Bgrmystr2,"yeah there's probably a reason, considering the community it caters to, Fence"
20-04-2019T22:41:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"Like, well, Daniels"
20-04-2019T22:41:47,FloofyCat,I kinda wanted to see Kat on a dating show but Nora takes pity on her since everyone is taken.
20-04-2019T22:42:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Or Red
20-04-2019T22:42:13,xcvb,^^
20-04-2019T22:42:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Tho maybe Red would work
20-04-2019T22:42:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Kai is best human
20-04-2019T22:42:25,FloofyCat,Kiwi must really enjoy the number of Keith and/or Natani things
20-04-2019T22:42:27,FenceEqualizer,"Heheh, true but dang it the story has both humans and Anthros. Where my equality!"
20-04-2019T22:42:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I know Zen and Sythe might get voted
20-04-2019T22:42:53,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Best boys
20-04-2019T22:42:55,xcvb,fem version?
20-04-2019T22:42:57,Sclimshady,"vote for more redxRaine, problem solved"

20-04-2019T22:43:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Its ok kiwi, I'll love them for you"

20-04-2019T22:44:02,MarvTheHugPharaoh,sleep can help with that I hear
20-04-2019T22:44:05,Bgrmystr2,"the streams are mentally exausting for you, huh tom?"
20-04-2019T22:44:06,unsteddyphoenix,Still adapting to new diet?
20-04-2019T22:44:07,SpazztasticKiwi,We could turn the tables on Eric and have a suggestion for him behind glass
20-04-2019T22:44:09,FenceEqualizer,Fight the sleep off Don't let it tell you what to do.
20-04-2019T22:44:12,FloofyCat,Go take a nap

20-04-2019T22:45:04,FenceEqualizer,Oh shoot Tom dieting? Yeah that can be rough from the start.
20-04-2019T22:45:13,SpazztasticKiwi,I mean as human. And the pressed against glass thing
20-04-2019T22:45:18,Bgrmystr2,tom's been doing that for a while though Fence
20-04-2019T22:45:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"it tickled my fancy, bgr.  it worked"
20-04-2019T22:45:23,SpazztasticKiwi,For the sake of phone screen saving

20-04-2019T23:14:09,Ordithus,They have less than 4 wheels!
20-04-2019T23:14:18,Ordithus,it's a wonderful loophole
20-04-2019T23:14:21,Bgrmystr2,so? Still a car.
20-04-2019T23:14:24,xcvb,they are not cars
20-04-2019T23:14:33,FenceEqualizer,Tell that to the ones who make the rules
20-04-2019T23:14:34,Dadrobit,I can't imagine owning one. Shit would get so hot. Entire cabin is in direct view of the sun.
20-04-2019T23:14:43,Bgrmystr2,"it ain't a bike, pickup, van, SUV, or semi"
20-04-2019T23:14:45,MarvTheHugPharaoh,it has something to do with it being either chain for belt driven
20-04-2019T23:14:47,Bgrmystr2,it's a car
20-04-2019T23:14:50,Ordithus,There aren't any windows
20-04-2019T23:14:54,Ordithus,It's not enclosed
20-04-2019T23:15:04,Bgrmystr2,not all cars are either
20-04-2019T23:15:15,Bgrmystr2,roadsters exist

20-04-2019T23:18:34,xcvb,thats the point
20-04-2019T23:19:28,Bgrmystr2,"I bet you there's a kiwi. Someone named it offline or online, or the fruit."
20-04-2019T23:19:33,Bgrmystr2,"Or perhaps the bird, though less likely."
20-04-2019T23:19:57,xcvb,don't search for loopholes
