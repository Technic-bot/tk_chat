07-03-2019T04:12:38,TorqueEmUp,"Oof, a friend of mine saw someone die today at work. =/"
07-03-2019T04:13:02,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock:
07-03-2019T04:13:05,Bgrmystr2,what happen
07-03-2019T04:15:34,TorqueEmUp,"Well he does security for this company, but one of the employees there collapsed in the hallway and died of a heart attack."
07-03-2019T04:16:33,Bgrmystr2,aw no..
07-03-2019T04:16:47,TorqueEmUp,He had to keep the hallway clear as the EMTs tried to revive the guy.
07-03-2019T04:17:08,TorqueEmUp,"Yeah, it hit my friend pretty hard."
07-03-2019T04:17:24,Bgrmystr2,that's balls.. EMTs are good people. Not all heros wear capes.
07-03-2019T04:17:32,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-sad:
07-03-2019T04:17:38,TorqueEmUp,"The guy was only 41, and was physically fit, had just got done working out shortly before it happened."
07-03-2019T04:19:23,Bgrmystr2,"just goes to show, even completely healthy people fall victim to life.."
07-03-2019T04:19:31,Bgrmystr2,"my condolences to your friend, bro"
07-03-2019T04:19:42,Bgrmystr2,had to have been hard to watch that
07-03-2019T04:20:17,TorqueEmUp,"Yeah, to get his mind off of it we went and saw Captain Marvel, twas very good."
07-03-2019T04:20:56,Bgrmystr2,good man :thumbsup:
07-03-2019T04:22:55,TorqueEmUp,"Yeah, they even review the cameras, watched to see if there was any sign of anything wrong before the guy had his heart attack. That probably didn't help."
07-03-2019T04:23:18,Bgrmystr2,no prolly not
07-03-2019T04:24:33,TorqueEmUp,I could only guess the guy must have had some diagnosed heart condition.
07-03-2019T04:24:40,TorqueEmUp,undiagnosed
07-03-2019T04:25:07,Bgrmystr2,maybe
07-03-2019T04:25:49,TorqueEmUp,But yeah
07-03-2019T04:26:14,TorqueEmUp,"I try to accept that I could drop dead tomorrow too, nothing we can do about it, we are all going to die one day."
07-03-2019T04:26:39,TorqueEmUp,"Except Tom, since apparently he's immortal. :P"
07-03-2019T04:28:07,TorqueEmUp,Guess it's best to go quickly. Most likely a Heart Attack is what's going to kill me. Unless there is some magical medical breakthrough before then.
07-03-2019T04:28:14,Bgrmystr2,yaeh lol lucky bastard.. or perhaps unlucky considering he has to deal with waves and waves of fans with the continous repeat every time the fandom dies and comes back
07-03-2019T04:29:11,TorqueEmUp,"Both my father's parent's died of heart attacks, both my parents deal with blood pressure issues. So it runs in the family."
07-03-2019T04:29:45,TorqueEmUp,parents* I dunno why I made it possessive. :P
07-03-2019T04:30:16,Bgrmystr2,maybe they were possessive? Inner turmoil of Torque.. we'll never know..
07-03-2019T04:30:35,TorqueEmUp,=P
07-03-2019T04:31:29,TorqueEmUp,"But luckily, that's pretty much the only genetic health problems my family has, aside from some anxiety issues, but who does have anxiety issues these days?"
07-03-2019T04:31:42,TorqueEmUp,doesn't*
07-03-2019T04:32:04,Bgrmystr2,I mean.. I don't think I do. I don't know exactly what it's like to have it or how it feels
07-03-2019T04:32:07,Bgrmystr2,but yknow
07-03-2019T04:32:14,Bgrmystr2,I seem kinda rare
07-03-2019T04:32:51,TorqueEmUp,"Mine comes and goes, I've just got better at controlling it."
07-03-2019T04:33:26,TorqueEmUp,"Rarely does it get bad, and usually only during the winter months."
07-03-2019T04:34:32,TorqueEmUp,"Well, most of my father's anxiety issue is because he worked as a cop for 20 years, and saw a lot of shit, and before that he was a Medic in the Air Force."
07-03-2019T04:34:53,Bgrmystr2,yeah that'll do it
07-03-2019T04:35:12,Bgrmystr2,"be a medic in some branch of military for long enough, you gonna see some shit."
07-03-2019T04:36:14,TorqueEmUp,He probably saw more shit as a cop though. At least that where I've heard most of his stories. He was the police officer that went to the scenes and took pictures.
07-03-2019T04:36:32,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-grossedout: I do not envy him
07-03-2019T04:36:38,Bgrmystr2,I would not be able to do that job
07-03-2019T04:36:58,TorqueEmUp,"Yeah, my friend today said they had an officer there doing that with the person who had the heart attack."
07-03-2019T04:37:43,Bgrmystr2,"I hope your friend gets his groove back soon, that kinda stuff will kill it for a while"
07-03-2019T04:38:28,TorqueEmUp,"Yeah, they are going to be offering counseling for the people that were involved in this."
07-03-2019T04:39:09,TorqueEmUp,"and his boss has called to check up on him, and apparently quite a few people were asking if he was alright after he had left work."
07-03-2019T04:40:06,TorqueEmUp,"offered to let him take the day off, my but friend refused, because they were already had it hard enough with staffing issues, and he didn't want to contribute to that."
07-03-2019T04:43:10,Bgrmystr2,well just keep him close and don't let him overstress or overwork.
07-03-2019T04:46:49,Bgrmystr2,"in brighter news, I'm getting a new phone tomorrow"
07-03-2019T04:55:46,Bgrmystr2,getting the samsung S8 active
07-03-2019T04:56:11,Bgrmystr2,"seems okay. wasn't my first choice, but out of 11 phones, tis the only one they even recognised the name of."
07-03-2019T09:34:21,Mippy,Good Morning from the city! Our hotel room has a splendid view of the hotel pool.
07-03-2019T10:26:44,Xexanoth,So you can watch all the nekkid people

07-03-2019T16:11:18,TerraTheWizard,also my count on the stats sheet is correct again
07-03-2019T16:12:03,TerraTheWizard,oh i see why
07-03-2019T16:12:21,TerraTheWizard,@twokinds forgot the sunday sketches tag from this one https://www.patreon.com/posts/tall-maddie-25222034
07-03-2019T16:15:28,Twokinds,Oh thanks
07-03-2019T16:15:59,Twokinds,"And yeah, the update is weird looking."
07-03-2019T16:16:06,Twokinds,Going to take some getting use to.
07-03-2019T16:16:17,TerraTheWizard,i can't tell what exactly it is about it
07-03-2019T16:16:22,TerraTheWizard,they removed a ton of bold text
07-03-2019T16:16:25,Twokinds,White on white
07-03-2019T16:16:30,Twokinds,So plain.
07-03-2019T16:16:33,Twokinds,The fonts are odd
07-03-2019T16:16:35,TerraTheWizard,mm
07-03-2019T16:17:32,TerraTheWizard,the plus side is it loads a lot faster now
07-03-2019T16:18:02,TerraTheWizard,and doesnt make my pc scream if i scroll down 3 pages
07-03-2019T16:31:40,Azumachan,Offensively bland.
07-03-2019T16:35:09,TerraTheWizard,i honestly can't tell if someone messed up the css or they thought it looked good
07-03-2019T16:39:20,Azumachan,No night mode.
07-03-2019T16:39:25,Bgrmystr2,"phone arrived, just waiting for AT&T to call and set up the sim card w/ the number.."
07-03-2019T16:59:38,Xexanoth,"jeez, it's like Patreon couldn't decid wether they wanted a visible line or not and compromised by going with barely visible line...."
07-03-2019T17:00:13,Xexanoth,"and now it just looks like those ""cute here"" lines...."
07-03-2019T17:00:16,Xexanoth,*cut
07-03-2019T17:00:44,Xexanoth,"though i guess ""cute here"" is pretty appropriate for Toms patreon page XD"
07-03-2019T17:03:44,Bgrmystr2,"yes, lots of the lines tom makes are cute"
07-03-2019T17:03:53,Bgrmystr2,but some.. some are just :ptv-ohmy:
07-03-2019T17:45:17,tehbear,No night mode -> use DarkReader or a similar addon
07-03-2019T17:46:07,tehbear,"for a site thats designed around infinite scrolling, i think anything that improves responsibility is good"
07-03-2019T17:46:18,tehbear,*responsiveness

07-03-2019T18:00:29,TerraTheWizard,can't decide what to suggest
07-03-2019T18:00:32,TerraTheWizard,got 3 i want to do
07-03-2019T18:04:21,tehbear,I want to suggest another lore/charachter background suggestion
07-03-2019T18:05:32,tehbear,just not sure what yet
07-03-2019T18:06:50,TerraTheWizard,"ok, decided on one"
07-03-2019T18:07:08,TerraTheWizard,let's see if this does better than the keith goatbeard one did
07-03-2019T18:12:14,tehbear,keith goatbeard -> ends up looking like his previous arch enemy Cornelius?
07-03-2019T18:13:31,tehbear,"or, more amusingly. People keep tugging his beard. Much to Keiths frustration"
07-03-2019T18:14:39,tehbear,"I think for it to get any traction, you would have to make it a bit more descriptive"
07-03-2019T18:18:12,TerraTheWizard,"well it was ""Keith's goatbeard goes too far"""
07-03-2019T18:18:18,TerraTheWizard,but that's shelved for now
07-03-2019T18:18:26,TerraTheWizard,doing a keith/laura suggestion now
07-03-2019T18:18:55,TerraTheWizard,"""Keith finds a magic lamp and summons Laura the genie."""

07-03-2019T21:02:46,SageSaga,Especially if you are in america or want to give more money- because it turns out they treat shipping as part of your goal even though a person has no way to estimate that
07-03-2019T21:03:19,Ordithus,Soon :tm:
07-03-2019T21:03:31,FoxxTrotter,"Been there, done that. :0)"

07-03-2019T21:23:04,Mihari,Bad year.
07-03-2019T21:23:11,Mihari,Not particularly.
07-03-2019T21:23:20,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Any way we can help out?
07-03-2019T21:23:50,Mihari,"Nope, cause that would likely take away possible monday from Sage's kickstarter. ^_^;"

07-03-2019T21:27:32,w0lfmare,Lann o/
07-03-2019T21:27:56,FoxxTrotter,"Hi, Lann."
07-03-2019T21:28:08,SageSaga,Kickstarter makes shipping part of your goal- which doesnt make any sense
07-03-2019T21:28:20,Ordithus,Ah
07-03-2019T21:29:02,SageSaga,i cant say for sure how many people in other countries are going to order my book- so anyone from say Australia is pushing the goal closer by almost double even though almost half is actually covered
07-03-2019T21:29:51,LannAF,Hi Foxx :D
07-03-2019T21:30:41,SageSaga,lets say i need to get 1000 dollars- and 50 awesome Ausies buy my book for 10 dollars and 10 dollars shipping
07-03-2019T21:31:12,SageSaga,"my goal is reached- but i needed 1000 to print the books, ive only got 500 now to print and 500 to ship the books to them"

07-03-2019T21:32:04,Nekonny,I'm trying to remember how I delt with that....
07-03-2019T21:32:27,SageSaga,"now i have no way to tell how many people are going to buy the books- so i cant say ""well i'll just ask for 2000 dollars"""
07-03-2019T21:32:58,Nekonny,cant you charge shipping seperately
07-03-2019T21:33:00,ZRO4825,Mwahahaha! Got out of work at a decent time for once. ^_^
07-03-2019T21:33:06,SageSaga,because what if i had 30 Ausies and 40 US citizens?
07-03-2019T21:33:15,Ordithus,Hi ZRO

07-03-2019T21:33:59,ZRO4825,"3D modeling now, Ron?"
07-03-2019T21:34:10,SageSaga,shipping should be separate from the goal money

07-03-2019T23:13:44,BadFoMo,Why is that?
07-03-2019T23:14:25,Nekonny,its frustrating
07-03-2019T23:15:09,Nekonny,even doing something I would consider simple is an epic struggle
07-03-2019T23:15:47,Reagantastic,hello
07-03-2019T23:16:01,Nekonny,its always been the case
07-03-2019T23:16:22,Nekonny,:ptv-sad:
07-03-2019T23:17:20,Twokinds,I know that struggle!
07-03-2019T23:17:58,Nekonny,comrade!
07-03-2019T23:18:08,SageSaga,3D makes sense to me in my head but in practice the tools always felt- cumbersome
07-03-2019T23:18:18,BadFoMo,"You've tried 3D printing too, Tom?"
07-03-2019T23:18:27,SageSaga,like trying to shape water into the image in my mind
07-03-2019T23:18:36,BadFoMo,"You too, Sage?"
07-03-2019T23:18:41,MrRetroRealm,Did someone say 3D Printing?
07-03-2019T23:18:51,SageSaga,i went to school for 3D animation...
07-03-2019T23:19:00,BadFoMo,Cool.
07-03-2019T23:19:00,Twokinds,Yeah
07-03-2019T23:19:04,SageSaga,got a degree and everything!
07-03-2019T23:19:19,SageSaga,made a big furry turtle for a project
07-03-2019T23:19:21,SamuelLeumas,"Sage, I'm jealous, I only got a dimploma in ""game development"", animation was my favourite part"

07-03-2019T23:19:43,BadFoMo,@Twokinds What were you printing?
07-03-2019T23:19:52,Nekonny,"one day I'll manage to sit down, go though the 30 hour ""intoduction to the zbrush interface"""
07-03-2019T23:20:11,MrRetroRealm,I wanna get Zbrush. Looks fun and easy to use
07-03-2019T23:20:13,Nekonny,and then foreget everything due to my poor memory
07-03-2019T23:20:15,BadFoMo,30 Hours?!
07-03-2019T23:20:24,Nekonny,feel slike it
07-03-2019T23:20:41,Ordithus,I've never dabbled in 3d modeling for figures.  Done plenty of CAD tho
07-03-2019T23:20:41,SamuelLeumas,"Speaking of ZBrush, the 2019 version was recently released along with subscription licenses, perpetual is still available"
07-03-2019T23:20:43,Twokinds,I mean no
07-03-2019T23:21:01,FenceEqualizer,Whats 30 hours when you can gain years of new knowledge
07-03-2019T23:21:34,MrRetroRealm,question. Is Zbrush free?
07-03-2019T23:21:39,Nekonny,nope
07-03-2019T23:22:01,MrRetroRealm,aww nuts
07-03-2019T23:22:02,SteelDragonFist,Hey.
07-03-2019T23:22:03,SamuelLeumas,"ZBrush is expensive, $850 USD for a perpetual license, or $40 USD a month"
07-03-2019T23:22:09,SamuelLeumas,Or $180 for 6 months
07-03-2019T23:22:09,SteelDragonFist,Yep
07-03-2019T23:22:13,FenceEqualizer,That's...gross
07-03-2019T23:22:15,MrRetroRealm,*faints*
07-03-2019T23:22:23,SteelDragonFist,That's crazy
07-03-2019T23:22:27,BadFoMo,I remember playing with Cad and Google SketchUp. Thoes were fun times.
07-03-2019T23:22:31,FenceEqualizer,What's with everything becoming subscription based?
07-03-2019T23:22:39,SteelDragonFist,I tried to use blender long time ago.
07-03-2019T23:22:48,SteelDragonFist,Good thing that's free.
07-03-2019T23:22:50,SageSaga,i like subscriptions- btw i have a patreon-
07-03-2019T23:22:54,MrRetroRealm,Reminds me how Adobe decided to do their braindead montly thing
07-03-2019T23:22:59,Nekonny,I do to XD
07-03-2019T23:23:16,SamuelLeumas,"Blender is changing a lot, version 2.9 is a huge change, apparently it'll rival maya"
07-03-2019T23:23:23,SteelDragonFist,O_O
07-03-2019T23:23:31,SamuelLeumas,But it's still experimental
07-03-2019T23:23:41,FenceEqualizer,Sage XD
07-03-2019T23:23:43,MrRetroRealm,"Seriously, who in their right mind is gonna mess with a software that HAS to be paid for every so often while software like Sai and Clip studio exist"
07-03-2019T23:23:58,SteelDragonFist,A crazy rich person I guess.
07-03-2019T23:23:59,Mippy,"@SageSaga Hey, do you still have some Kaylin Dakis?"
07-03-2019T23:24:08,SageSaga,i have a few
07-03-2019T23:24:10,SamuelLeumas,It's the price of industry standard software
07-03-2019T23:24:12,FenceEqualizer,People who like familiar products Mrretro
07-03-2019T23:24:13,SteelDragonFist,If they know what they're doing that is.
07-03-2019T23:24:21,MrRetroRealm,Ah
07-03-2019T23:24:32,MrRetroRealm,Well Adobe kinda lost my trust after that
07-03-2019T23:24:52,MrRetroRealm,Only exception is their flash player and and flash animation
07-03-2019T23:24:57,FenceEqualizer,Plus when it's your job I can kinda see why subscription works
07-03-2019T23:25:07,SamuelLeumas,"And there are people that definitely prefer SAI over photoshop, as fence said, it depends on what people prefer"
07-03-2019T23:25:08,SageSaga,also - Clip Studio has a subscription service for apple- or at least ipad
07-03-2019T23:25:13,FenceEqualizer,Just sucks if you want to keep it strictly light hobby based

07-03-2019T23:26:15,BadFoMo,"@Twokinds Aw. Well, if you do get into 3D printing; may I request a TwoKinds Board Game that uses PlayDoe (Ex. The Grape Escape and Splat)?"
07-03-2019T23:26:27,SamuelLeumas,"I agree that subscription licenses are annoying, but they also make it more managable for those that don't have a decent income"
07-03-2019T23:26:45,BadFoMo,Not that I'll be able to get it.
07-03-2019T23:27:17,SamuelLeumas,"No point in getting a printer if you don't do 3D to begin with, in my opinion"
07-03-2019T23:28:26,Nekonny,you can sub to my youtube channel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWodAuBQ_M4
07-03-2019T23:28:29,SteelDragonFist,I wanna do some 3D art again sometime.

07-03-2019T23:30:01,SageSaga,Mippy- They went up on the cost of shipping to your country- so its gonna be a few dollars more - ok?
07-03-2019T23:30:07,Mippy,Done and done
