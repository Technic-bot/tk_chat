02-11-2019T15:17:40,ThingsAreMoving,yup
02-11-2019T15:18:03,ThingsAreMoving,I prefer the general poll tbh
02-11-2019T15:18:18,ThingsAreMoving,but i understand it's pretty tedious to put into a decent graph

02-11-2019T15:20:36,ThingsAreMoving,problem with current tkpolls is that not many people are able to vote

02-11-2019T15:21:26,Sclimshady,"Yeah, but money tho"

02-11-2019T15:22:10,Sclimshady,"Plus, I lose overtime on those"
02-11-2019T15:22:11,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-adiracoin:
02-11-2019T15:22:40,ThingsAreMoving,holidays are like potions in jRPG's you accumulate them all game and eventually you realize you've never actually used them
02-11-2019T15:23:08,Sclimshady,Dont call me out like that :ctwokinds-flomad:
02-11-2019T15:23:27,Sclimshady,I had 60 unused days at my last job
02-11-2019T15:23:33,ThingsAreMoving,:ctwokinds-smug: guessed right?

02-11-2019T15:24:04,Sclimshady,"Yeah,  I got to sell them though"
02-11-2019T15:24:15,Ordithus,I think I've gotten 60 days TOTAL in my 9 years in the working world
02-11-2019T15:24:19,Sclimshady,Its 8 weeks

02-11-2019T15:25:01,Ordithus,"10 days most years, so yeah.  Math and such"
02-11-2019T15:25:03,ThingsAreMoving,"I have 32 days off every year, including 8 bank holidays"
02-11-2019T15:25:20,Ordithus,Recently moved up to 15!  Which is nice

02-11-2019T15:31:02,TerraTheWizard,streaky works better for burgers
02-11-2019T15:31:15,Sclimshady,Streaky works better everywhere
02-11-2019T15:31:30,ThingsAreMoving,back bacon is just sliver of actual bacon with fat and a huge part of a loin
02-11-2019T15:31:43,Glassan,"Speaking of Eggs & Bacon, it's almost workout & breakfast time for me. Guess I'll see what democracy wants for sketches in an hour."

02-11-2019T20:34:30,Dadrobit,The temperature is low enough now that creatures are allowed to live agian.
02-11-2019T20:34:34,Dadrobit,again*

02-11-2019T20:34:56,ThingsAreMoving,mosquitoes need large water reservoirs to lay eggs
02-11-2019T20:35:01,ThingsAreMoving,like swamps or rivers
02-11-2019T20:35:12,FreelancerAgentMaine,I have been cleaning my house for 4 hours and 30 minutes
02-11-2019T20:35:20,ThingsAreMoving,"unless there's some kind of desert mosquitoes, then god help us all"
02-11-2019T20:35:32,unsteddyphoenix,Theyve....evolved
02-11-2019T20:35:39,CrRAR,They thrist like nothing else
02-11-2019T20:35:48,Dadrobit,And lakes and assholes who have their sprinklers on 18 hours a day and assholes that leave their pools unatended.
02-11-2019T20:35:51,FreelancerAgentMaine,I don't know what this entire conversation about mosquitoes is about but have any of you been to Arizona because water does not exist and mosquitoes do
02-11-2019T20:36:00,Sclimshady,"Sage, thats not a nap, thats a short sleep"
02-11-2019T20:36:01,SageSaga,so Pokemon leaks are coming out- anyone find a list of pokemon not available on the game?
02-11-2019T20:36:14,Dadrobit,"Sage, I've been wondering the same"
02-11-2019T20:36:25,Kynum,I can make one. But it'll be of pokemon that don't exist.
02-11-2019T20:36:41,SageSaga,the pokemon not available will determine if i even get it
02-11-2019T20:36:57,FreelancerAgentMaine,"everyone, as much as I would love to stay, I wouldn't love much more to make my homemade baked macaroni, and no you cannot have any, it is mine"
02-11-2019T20:37:01,unsteddyphoenix,What pokemon's the deal breaker
02-11-2019T20:37:13,Arbiter722,hi

02-11-2019T20:37:27,ThingsAreMoving,how dare you
02-11-2019T20:37:28,Dadrobit,There are a lot of golf resorts and public parks with lakes that are breeding grounds for mosquitoes. They're everywhere.
02-11-2019T20:37:52,Stormagedon,Im sorry...

02-11-2019T20:38:27,Dadrobit,They've been revealed in trailers
02-11-2019T20:38:56,Dadrobit,My guess is gonna be the previous starters (excepting Gen 1) are gonna be a majority of the culled Pokemon.
02-11-2019T20:39:03,unsteddyphoenix,plus they wouldnt DARE leave out eevees
02-11-2019T20:39:09,Dadrobit,Which is bullshit btw

02-11-2019T20:44:51,RandomTonio,Hello
02-11-2019T20:44:51,FloofyCat,@ThingsAreMoving We've seen a much younger Kat playing with a ball of yarn.

02-11-2019T20:45:04,ThingsAreMoving,"Oooooh, right"

02-11-2019T20:46:17,ThingsAreMoving,May I remind you I'm not a Kat person.
02-11-2019T20:46:25,Stormagedon,this is why Kat is my fave
02-11-2019T20:46:26,ThingsAreMoving,"I appreciate, but not at the same level"

02-11-2019T20:52:26,Ordithus,seems the boys aren't the most welcoming
02-11-2019T20:52:26,CrRAR,Mike’s probably telling Evals to mind his manners after Evals said something rood.
02-11-2019T20:52:29,Ordithus,Jealous I think
02-11-2019T20:52:50,unsteddyphoenix,Slaves blaming each other instead of fighting the MAN

02-11-2019T20:54:32,Ordithus,"Well, I certainly understand some resentment"
02-11-2019T20:54:45,Ordithus,"Though it really should be at Eric and not Kat, people are not always rational"
02-11-2019T20:54:57,unsteddyphoenix,Isnt Eric still like 7 here
02-11-2019T20:55:07,CrRAR,lol

02-11-2019T20:55:10,FloofyCat,"Kat is getting special treatment, so I can understand their resentment."
02-11-2019T20:55:13,unsteddyphoenix,Or...more like...13 I guess?
02-11-2019T20:55:16,Ordithus,"Older than that, Kat is only what, 11, and he's like 20"
02-11-2019T20:55:17,Dadrobit,called it
02-11-2019T20:55:17,ThingsAreMoving,It's easier to target someone readily available and who can't fight back

02-11-2019T22:31:38,Dadrobit,The real mindfuck comes from the people who are obsessed with Raine who came from someone else's mind entirely before Tom adopted her and molded her anew.

02-11-2019T22:32:45,Ordithus,Raine is... adopted?

02-11-2019T22:44:21,Dadrobit,"Though, to be fair, I wasn't actually engaging with the community until around 2011."
02-11-2019T22:44:38,Sclimshady,https://www.2kinds.com/halfkind/?p=1
02-11-2019T22:44:40,Dadrobit,TheMoreYouKnow.gif
02-11-2019T22:44:50,Sclimshady,Found it
02-11-2019T22:46:09,Sclimshady,"Im worse Dad,  found it in 15, started engaging this year"
02-11-2019T22:46:22,w0lfmare,I started reading Nov 25th 09
02-11-2019T22:46:35,Ordithus,This has some more description of it https://www.deviantart.com/twokinds/art/The-HalfKind-Comic-193475786
02-11-2019T22:46:48,Sclimshady,"Tbf, I didnt know waht a furry or any of this was until 15"
02-11-2019T22:47:11,Ordithus,I started reading immediately after the 2014 april fool's fiasco
02-11-2019T22:47:34,Ordithus,So I got to start with the kiss :ctwokinds-natkeith:
02-11-2019T22:48:12,Sclimshady,Like the comic page? or some tea that needs spillin
02-11-2019T22:48:24,Dadrobit,I found it ironically through an anti-furry club in my school (because edgelord dadrobit was once a thing) and then unironically enjoyed it.
02-11-2019T22:48:33,Sclimshady,Edgy
02-11-2019T22:48:40,Dadrobit,supremely
02-11-2019T22:48:47,Ordithus,amazing
02-11-2019T22:48:57,Dadrobit,I think it's even mentioned somewhere in my yearbook.
02-11-2019T22:49:13,SomeNiceUser,"Bye everyone, have a great day!"
02-11-2019T22:49:18,Ordithus,bye snu
02-11-2019T22:49:19,Sclimshady,That you became a furry through irony?
02-11-2019T22:49:25,Sclimshady,bye SNU
02-11-2019T22:50:13,Dadrobit,"Nah, still not a furry, I am thoroughly enamored with my human self. I just enjoy TwoKinds, Housepets, and Lackadaisy."
02-11-2019T22:50:35,Sclimshady,"my b, not what I meant.  An anthro follower"
02-11-2019T22:51:01,Dadrobit,Suppose something kinda like that.
02-11-2019T22:51:05,Ordithus,"Hooman is good, anthros can be neat.  Potential for different looks and stories"
02-11-2019T22:51:09,Sclimshady,like w0lfy
02-11-2019T22:51:20,Dadrobit,"Oh, also Beastars, that shit is nutty. Caught up the manga last night."
02-11-2019T22:51:26,Sclimshady,"I like both, just find anthro more fun"
02-11-2019T22:52:26,SpazztasticKiwi,nite Tom
02-11-2019T22:53:37,Dadrobit,Be back in a bit. Gotta clean the dishes from lunch
02-11-2019T23:02:19,Ordithus,:snowflake::snowman2::snowflake:
02-11-2019T23:03:06,Sclimshady,No :turkey:
02-11-2019T23:03:31,Ordithus,I can't tell the weather to stop
02-11-2019T23:08:24,SpazztasticKiwi,so you gonna skip all the food then
02-11-2019T23:08:26,SpazztasticKiwi,huh

02-11-2019T23:08:57,Ordithus,wait what no
02-11-2019T23:09:09,Ordithus,I was merely commenting on how it is snowing outside
02-11-2019T23:09:39,Sclimshady,Food changed your tune real quick
02-11-2019T23:10:03,Ordithus,Can't I be happy for pretty snow :cw0lfmare-Saltyember:
02-11-2019T23:10:42,Sclimshady,"No, because I have none"
02-11-2019T23:11:03,Sclimshady,I would loooove to see these Californians flounder in the snow
02-11-2019T23:11:27,Sclimshady,Plus take all their money for recoveries
02-11-2019T23:11:55,SpazztasticKiwi,no
02-11-2019T23:12:04,SpazztasticKiwi,snow is cold and wet
02-11-2019T23:12:30,SpazztasticKiwi,and melts peoples ability to drive
02-11-2019T23:12:52,Sclimshady,I could probably make a months pay in a day pulling them out while the tow services are snowed in
02-11-2019T23:13:07,Ordithus,"That is a thing, sclim"
02-11-2019T23:13:18,JojoF2415,Hello
02-11-2019T23:13:21,Sclimshady,What is?
02-11-2019T23:13:31,Sclimshady,Hi Jo
02-11-2019T23:13:32,Ordithus,Pulling people out of ditches
02-11-2019T23:13:51,JojoF2415,How was the stream
02-11-2019T23:13:54,Ordithus,"Big storms, tow services can't keep up"
02-11-2019T23:13:55,Sclimshady,"Yeah, I did it in Kansas. but they know how to drive"
02-11-2019T23:14:03,SpazztasticKiwi,"I kid you not, you probably could make good money during cold wet times here"
02-11-2019T23:14:12,Sclimshady,Tow and plows were out of service due to ice
02-11-2019T23:14:17,SpazztasticKiwi,plenty of people slide or drive into ditches
02-11-2019T23:14:53,Sclimshady,"Also, these people are rich.  I could charge way more"
02-11-2019T23:20:51,SpazztasticKiwi,"if you can imagine how you should drive, you have grandma in the passenger seat with a crock pot full of gravy, two batches of fresh biscuits in the back and a pot of chili"
02-11-2019T23:21:03,SpazztasticKiwi,and grandma is wearing her new white dress
02-11-2019T23:21:52,Ordithus,[Pedal to the metal]*:cw0lfmare-Paperembercool:
02-11-2019T23:23:32,SpazztasticKiwi,that’s how you become one with a telephone pole

02-11-2019T23:27:03,Ordithus,"Driving, jeez"
02-11-2019T23:28:09,SpazztasticKiwi,driving requires a road and following the laws of physics
02-11-2019T23:31:19,Sclimshady,"Where were going, we dont need roads"
