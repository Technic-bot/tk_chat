09-02-2019T16:48:29,georgiwolf2232,well the plants soon will be artificial so the honey will too be artificial
09-02-2019T16:48:31,ThingsAreMoving,"I do, but calling stuff organic where it doesn't need to be grinds my gears more than I'd like to admit"
09-02-2019T16:48:38,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs about as fresh and straight for the bee as you can basically get
09-02-2019T16:48:56,ThingsAreMoving,Grab some and smear your lips with it.
09-02-2019T16:49:02,Mippy,Honey is bee vomit
09-02-2019T16:49:03,ThingsAreMoving,don't lick it off and you'll heal quickly
09-02-2019T16:49:29,SpazztasticKiwi,You know I learned red honey can mean the bees are fertilizing nearby weed plants

09-02-2019T17:27:16,Mippy,Steam: Your money is no good here
09-02-2019T17:27:21,Bgrmystr2,"if they really wanted my money, they'd be selling games I actually want. Which they are not."
09-02-2019T17:27:40,WereKeidran,was trying to buy a game but i was getting an error and it wouldn't take my payment

09-02-2019T17:30:02,Bgrmystr2,It's a female mind that had parts of it rendered useless.
09-02-2019T17:30:03,Xexanoth,tom said himself she has a male mind...
09-02-2019T17:30:08,TerraTheWizard,natani's complicated
09-02-2019T17:30:15,Xexanoth,so you're arguing against the writer himself...
09-02-2019T17:30:19,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Xex, its best to ignore those arguments.  They don't stay civil"
09-02-2019T17:30:26,ThingsAreMoving,"Xex, the topic of Natani's gender stuff has bee discussed so many times on so many different angles..."
09-02-2019T17:30:29,ThingsAreMoving,they never end well
09-02-2019T17:30:37,BadFoMo,Yep.
09-02-2019T17:30:43,Bgrmystr2,cuz she blocked out all the female parts xD. And yeah what things said.
09-02-2019T17:31:13,Xexanoth,"i just find it funny that people are disagreeing with the writer himsell, like ""hey it's clearly stated what going on, let's just ignore it"""
09-02-2019T17:31:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Know what really blows people‚Äôs mind? Cross dressing for fashion while being relatively straight
09-02-2019T17:31:26,QuinnMalachite,Theres always people that don't get or don't want to get transgender people
09-02-2019T17:31:51,Bgrmystr2,"It's more complicated than that, xex, I'm just going by the lore of the comic itself."
09-02-2019T17:32:25,Xexanoth,in which natani states she's a guy? and that she even felt that way before the soullink with Zen?
09-02-2019T17:32:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Just don‚Äôt argue with stupid. They‚Äôll drag you down to their level and beat you with experience

09-02-2019T17:33:49,QuinnMalachite,"Natani is transgender, and there's lots of people that don't want that to exist"
09-02-2019T17:34:01,Xexanoth,"but then people just go ""nope doesn't count"""

09-02-2019T17:34:46,Bgrmystr2,It's simply because there's too many variables and zero actual experience in real life. Noone in history has ever been both. It's not something we can compare it to. We just create in our minds what we want to see instead of what actually happened.
09-02-2019T17:34:47,Combak,"Honestly, some transgender people don't even like the way Natani is treated, so... Maybe trans isn't the best term for Nat?"
09-02-2019T17:34:49,Bgrmystr2,Natani is a bridge.

09-02-2019T18:22:06,Mippy,Pretty much Things
09-02-2019T18:22:08,Dadrobit,That movie is literally the worst book to movie adaptation ever made.

09-02-2019T18:22:47,Dadrobit,The movie was based off of a book who's author inded penned scientology.
09-02-2019T18:22:52,SageSaga,it melted right when they fired a laser towards the camera
09-02-2019T18:22:54,Dadrobit,indeed*

09-02-2019T18:25:19,Tharkis,"i quite liked bladerunner2049, it was so 'true' to the original"
09-02-2019T18:25:20,ThingsAreMoving,I didn't watch the sequel
09-02-2019T18:25:21,Xexanoth,"well, i think the original suffers a bit from age"
09-02-2019T18:25:23,Tharkis,"the pacing, the style, etc"
09-02-2019T18:25:28,ThingsAreMoving,somehow I've missed it

09-02-2019T18:26:12,Bgrmystr2,"I never watched the sequel.. but I never got suuuper into the original, mostly the architecture and technological design"
09-02-2019T18:26:15,ThingsAreMoving,"Get CISCO approved books and learn from them, Terra2"
09-02-2019T18:26:18,Tharkis,i recommend watching them back to back if you can =D

09-02-2019T18:33:50,TerraTheWizard,i really should relearn it
09-02-2019T18:33:54,Xexanoth,you can only find out if you should do it by trying

09-02-2019T18:34:41,TheDanksmith,ty :D
09-02-2019T18:34:42,BadFoMo,*most likely
09-02-2019T18:34:42,ThingsAreMoving,"yeah there are problems you can look up in a book, some need stack overflow, some require github scouring"
09-02-2019T18:34:47,TerraTheWizard,"because chances are whatever you're trying to to, someone else has already done it better than you and lets you use it for free"

09-02-2019T18:35:58,Bgrmystr2,"programming will always be needed. Even if you don't know a coding language, once you learn a couple, you end up picking it up much faster."
09-02-2019T18:36:12,ThingsAreMoving,then either programming or security imho
09-02-2019T18:36:34,ThingsAreMoving,up to you if you'd rather learn and use high level math and physics
09-02-2019T18:36:36,Bgrmystr2,security will likely be the same story

09-02-2019T21:52:25,unsteddyphoenix,"If a mage casts an ""invulerable"" spell on something, would a basitin nullify it with their basiting resistance?"
09-02-2019T21:52:39,unsteddyphoenix,"Instead of resistance, its actually nullification?"
09-02-2019T21:53:07,Alphawolf333,Well if you want to be technical in dragon ball it's Ki which is a physical energy
09-02-2019T21:53:09,vevans0009,Would love to be suplexed by her.

09-02-2019T21:54:24,ThingsAreMoving,And with this one swift move Adelaide ended the basitin/keidran feud. The keidran lost their god and wasted away. Humans followed soon after.
09-02-2019T21:54:41,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, if you think about it, even magic has to exist within the laws of physics in the twokinds world, or it wouldn't be possible. It has to make sense, somehow, in some way, so I'd think Adalaide's sheer strength would be able to affect it in some way."
09-02-2019T21:54:46,Ordithus,Well that's dark
09-02-2019T21:55:00,BadFoMo,"Back. Also, is this that 4th Mask that's been talked about before?"

09-02-2019T21:55:06,unsteddyphoenix,That fits with my theory
09-02-2019T21:55:19,unsteddyphoenix,Since Tom has stated basitin resistence scales with their physical strength too
09-02-2019T21:55:20,CatzArt,Cool theorizing
09-02-2019T21:55:34,Combak,We've talked about a fourth mask before? I need to pay more attention!
09-02-2019T21:55:46,ThingsAreMoving,"Man, Basitin have so many synergies with strength."
09-02-2019T21:55:48,unsteddyphoenix,So adelaide turbo strength means turbo resistence means turbo ghost-pounding
09-02-2019T21:55:54,Twokinds,"Realistically, it's the only way Basitins really stand a chance against magic users"
09-02-2019T21:55:55,vevans0009,Pain be worth it.

09-02-2019T22:24:28,NeonMitsumi,lmao Kat and Zen win and everyone starts leaving.
09-02-2019T22:24:34,unsteddyphoenix,Im counting on you Tom
09-02-2019T22:24:39,MrEase,"people are allowed to be upset, as long as it doesn't get to the point where its insulting anyone"
09-02-2019T22:24:40,unsteddyphoenix,No pressure
09-02-2019T22:24:49,Ordithus,"Well, she is drunk.  And a kiss on the cheek isn't that big a deal"
09-02-2019T22:24:52,CrRAR,"*somewhere Natani jolts awake, confused*"
09-02-2019T22:24:59,Ordithus,"But, again, I support all the ships"
09-02-2019T22:24:59,ElvenHunter84,I feel like it is pretty insulting to the winner
09-02-2019T22:25:02,ShadowSoap,doesn't want to go to college tomorrow.

09-02-2019T22:25:13,TorqueEmUp,I regret every making the drunk Kat Suggestion last year. :P
09-02-2019T22:25:17,TorqueEmUp,ever*
09-02-2019T22:25:18,Mippy,However I do ship :ctwokinds-natkeith: and they are part of the suggestion...
09-02-2019T22:25:20,CatzArt,Neon! No
09-02-2019T22:25:28,NeonMitsumi,What
09-02-2019T22:25:31,WereKeidran,"this was my number 2 vote, number 1 was the Zen valentine's day card reading"
09-02-2019T22:25:34,NeonMitsumi,That's what suggestion says.
09-02-2019T22:25:35,unsteddyphoenix,That drunk one was really interesting though Torque
09-02-2019T22:25:36,ElvenHunter84,"Like, it's fine to say you don't like a ship or something, but just straight up dissing the suggestion is a bit much"
09-02-2019T22:25:38,CatzArt,No licking
09-02-2019T22:25:56,unsteddyphoenix,I disagree
09-02-2019T22:26:02,unsteddyphoenix,Personally attacking the suggestor is when its too much
09-02-2019T22:26:14,NeonMitsumi,Dissing the suggestions is completely fine.
09-02-2019T22:26:35,unsteddyphoenix,Im not gonna censor peoples opinions unless they get offensive or spammy with it
09-02-2019T22:26:37,TorqueEmUp,Just don't go overboard with the complaiing.
09-02-2019T22:26:45,TorqueEmUp,complaining*
09-02-2019T22:26:46,Xexanoth,"i don't ship kat and zen, but i found the suggestion intresting"
09-02-2019T22:26:48,NeonMitsumi,Miharahar
09-02-2019T22:26:49,Mippy,Pretty much
09-02-2019T22:26:51,ElvenHunter84,I just got a bit of shit when I suggested Dead Keith a while ago
09-02-2019T22:26:55,MrEase,"yeah, me showing distaste for all the WWII stuff or people showing distaste for this, isn't insulting the person who suggested it"
09-02-2019T22:27:12,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah apparently dadrobit got threats when he suggested dead natani or w/e
09-02-2019T22:27:15,Bgrmystr2,"Depends on how it's said, it can be."
09-02-2019T22:27:20,Xexanoth,it sure beat *blatant fanservice #59*
09-02-2019T22:27:23,NeonMitsumi,Oofie
09-02-2019T22:27:29,Mippy,It‚Äôs all about what floats your boat
09-02-2019T22:27:50,unsteddyphoenix,But this is exactly fanservice though
09-02-2019T22:27:59,Mippy,We are all gonna like or dislike something
09-02-2019T22:28:03,Xexanoth,all sketches are fanservie
09-02-2019T22:28:03,unsteddyphoenix,It doesnt need boobs to be fanservice
09-02-2019T22:28:03,MrEase,guess what
09-02-2019T22:28:06,Ordithus,Kat's cleaning instincts kick in when drunk
09-02-2019T22:28:10,MrEase,most of TK is fanservice
09-02-2019T22:28:16,MrEase,and thats fine
09-02-2019T22:28:23,Xexanoth,but there's a difference between making it clever/intresting or boring
09-02-2019T22:28:24,Ordithus,"Zen was a dirty boy, now he can be all sparkly"
09-02-2019T22:28:25,MrEase,thats what some people are here for
09-02-2019T22:28:34,NeonMitsumi,"Overused at this point, tbh."
09-02-2019T22:28:36,MrEase,~~that is what a lot of people are here for~~
09-02-2019T22:28:45,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"I, I gotta"
09-02-2019T22:28:49,MarvTheHugPharaoh,REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
09-02-2019T22:28:50,Xexanoth,this one makes use of the mind link between zen and nat in an intresting manner
09-02-2019T22:28:53,Combak,"Eh, some people find the story interesting too."
09-02-2019T22:28:54,WereKeidran,brb
09-02-2019T22:28:56,NeonMitsumi,There's the Marv.
09-02-2019T22:29:04,Mippy,I‚Äôm honestly not that fond of transformation stuff. Doesn‚Äôt do it for me
09-02-2019T22:29:06,BadFoMo,@Mippy //Troll Does that mean I can request a TwoKinds version of Willy Wonka?

09-02-2019T22:29:16,MuonNeutrino,man this song.... hnnng...
09-02-2019T22:29:16,Xexanoth,"so it's more intresting than ""character does a sexy pose"""
09-02-2019T22:29:21,unsteddyphoenix,What if theyre transforming into basitins mippy?
09-02-2019T22:29:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"yeah, back to Purps stream"
09-02-2019T22:29:48,Mippy,I‚Äôll give you that one Teddy
09-02-2019T22:30:05,unsteddyphoenix,I can definetly think of far more intersting ways to explore the mind link

09-02-2019T22:31:35,MrEase,true
09-02-2019T22:31:37,ElvenHunter84,It's the floof that makes her look bigger than she is
09-02-2019T22:31:39,Xexanoth,but this is wholesome
09-02-2019T22:31:47,MarvTheHugPharaoh,No its not Xex
09-02-2019T22:31:50,BadFoMo,You might not like my April and May requests.
09-02-2019T22:31:51,Xexanoth,cause all the happy snugglines
09-02-2019T22:32:09,Ordithus,It's cute.  Get over it.
09-02-2019T22:32:09,Mippy,Wholesome dose not get votes :ctwokinds-sadtrace2:
09-02-2019T22:32:17,RimaDraws,yea i wish it did....
09-02-2019T22:32:18,unsteddyphoenix,Literally wholesome just got votes
09-02-2019T22:32:20,MrEase,its kinda wholesome
09-02-2019T22:32:24,thestooge,Zen's liking it :smile:
09-02-2019T22:32:24,Mippy,Bits and Bobs do
09-02-2019T22:32:25,NeonMitsumi,Eeeeh
09-02-2019T22:32:26,unsteddyphoenix,Just now. It just happened.
09-02-2019T22:32:31,ElvenHunter84,What gets votes changes every single week
09-02-2019T22:32:37,RimaDraws,i was at second a few weeks ago and mine got out voted by fanservice left it in eighth last week
09-02-2019T22:32:41,unsteddyphoenix,The...wholesome one got voted and is currently being drawn
09-02-2019T22:32:42,ElvenHunter84,there is almost no way to consistently track it
09-02-2019T22:32:52,Xexanoth,what ph√∂nix says
09-02-2019T22:32:54,unsteddyphoenix,It beat two of the current trendy pinups
09-02-2019T22:32:59,ElvenHunter84,but there are trends if you look closely
09-02-2019T22:33:10,Corinthian,I'm heading out. Night everyone!
09-02-2019T22:33:15,Xexanoth,night
09-02-2019T22:33:16,MrEase,"this pic literally defeated Nazis, therefore it is a good pic"
09-02-2019T22:33:17,Ordithus,Night Corin
09-02-2019T22:33:22,MrEase,and is wholesome
09-02-2019T22:33:22,Ordithus,lol yes Ease
09-02-2019T22:33:23,Mippy,Not that I don‚Äôt like Bits and Bobs....but they are always the wrong Bits and Bobs
09-02-2019T22:33:25,Xexanoth,lol ease
09-02-2019T22:33:29,unsteddyphoenix,"Honestly yall, the complaining about fanservice is getting to the bounds of denying reality"
09-02-2019T22:33:48,Xexanoth,the whole point of these sketches is that they are fanservice
09-02-2019T22:33:56,unsteddyphoenix,"""bits and bobs"" Fanservice loses almost just as much as it wins"
09-02-2019T22:34:05,ElvenHunter84,Even if they are fanservice to only one fan
09-02-2019T22:34:22,CatzArt,less fan service!
09-02-2019T22:34:27,Ordithus,"Guys, guys, Florence is really busy servicing all the fans."
09-02-2019T22:34:31,TorqueEmUp,I think people are just getting tired of very samey suggestions getting insanely popular for extended periods of time.
09-02-2019T22:34:31,Mippy,Pole Danceing Alabaster *drooling*
09-02-2019T22:34:52,Ordithus,Give her a break :P
09-02-2019T22:35:17,NeonMitsumi,She should get one of those bladeless fans or however they are called.
09-02-2019T22:35:18,TorqueEmUp,I'd go for some more Florence
09-02-2019T22:35:34,BearFlipsTable,agree mippy
09-02-2019T22:35:36,ElvenHunter84,What Torque said. Some people just aren't into WW2 pinups (or pinups in general) and seeing them every single week gets exhausting
09-02-2019T22:35:57,Mippy,Bear agrees with me :ctwokinds-clovisgirl_shake:
09-02-2019T22:36:05,CatzArt,I was excited that the book club finally got chosen
09-02-2019T22:36:07,unsteddyphoenix,"Thats fair, but theres nothing we can do about that at all"
09-02-2019T22:36:22,TorqueEmUp,"Nope, the lurkers are ruling the votes right now."
09-02-2019T22:36:22,BadFoMo,"@MrEase I've been wondering, if that won, how would Tom handle the are band?"
09-02-2019T22:36:43,ElvenHunter84,I'm happy as long as there are at least 2 suggestions that I like per week
09-02-2019T22:36:49,unsteddyphoenix,"I'd like if we didnt point fingers at random things when our suggestions dont ""win"""
09-02-2019T22:37:09,unsteddyphoenix,"Like ""mine lost cause of boobs"" or ""mine lost cause of keithtani""."
09-02-2019T22:37:19,unsteddyphoenix,"Its true to a degree, but its really getting out of hand imo"
09-02-2019T22:37:29,Ordithus,Mine lost because it didn't get the most votes :ctwokinds-keith8D:
09-02-2019T22:37:36,ElvenHunter84,"If that stuff is true, then the only way to surely win a sketch is to suggest nothing at all"
09-02-2019T22:37:37,TorqueEmUp,"a little bit, yeah."
09-02-2019T22:37:40,CrRAR,Hahaha ord
09-02-2019T22:37:45,NeonMitsumi,Mine lost because I didn't suggest it :cneonmitsumi-stoned_n_furious:
09-02-2019T22:37:55,ElvenHunter84,The Nora in a snowstorm is the most neutral suggestion
09-02-2019T22:38:00,unsteddyphoenix,Hahaha
09-02-2019T22:38:09,Mippy,"Yeah, my possibly cute and wholesome suggestion totally bombed today...and I wasn‚Äôt like ‚Äúoh that suggestion sucks‚Äù blah blah blah...just because I lost horribly"
09-02-2019T22:38:14,Xexanoth,why would he care about the arm band FoMo?
09-02-2019T22:38:43,unsteddyphoenix,"Exactly. People dont really seem to be into my current suggestion, and thats fine. I'll try somethin' else next week probably."
09-02-2019T22:38:48,BearFlipsTable,"but mip, we're in the minority, we cant win. also we complain now but im sure once the bois start getting the lewd suggestions we wont be complaining at all"
09-02-2019T22:39:17,unsteddyphoenix,Just suggest alaric~
09-02-2019T22:39:18,ElvenHunter84,I'm too hardheaded to suggest something else lol. I'm going to keep throwing this one at the wall until it sticks
09-02-2019T22:39:26,BadFoMo,Many people don't really like what they did with the Wheel of Life.
09-02-2019T22:39:33,Ordithus,Zen's blush is cute
09-02-2019T22:39:36,NeonMitsumi,Was Alric turned into ash too? :thinking:
09-02-2019T22:39:37,unsteddyphoenix,I just dont have the attention span for that elven lol
09-02-2019T22:39:41,Bgrmystr2,"I think the problem is people like the ""good"" trends, but ignore the ppl that dislike their trend.. same ppl who complain when a trend wins that they don't like."
09-02-2019T22:39:46,Mippy,I do Teddy...but it‚Äôs always close but no cigar
09-02-2019T22:39:53,Bgrmystr2,"Everyone gets a turn, every trend gets time on screen. It happens."
09-02-2019T22:39:59,Bgrmystr2,It's not bias
09-02-2019T22:40:05,unsteddyphoenix,Mmm...suave alaric with a cigar...
09-02-2019T22:40:10,unsteddyphoenix,Maybe some whiskey...
09-02-2019T22:40:14,Bgrmystr2,"it's gonna happen, ppl gonna lose xD"

09-02-2019T22:56:18,unsteddyphoenix,"Since Renis a dragon, can she magic the visuals of the fanfics?"
09-02-2019T22:56:30,unsteddyphoenix,Like create a VR-esque fanfic mindscape?
09-02-2019T22:56:32,Ordithus,Reni can't really magic very well yet
09-02-2019T22:56:39,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-reniderp:

09-02-2019T22:56:52,w0lfmare,Albaster has been shipping Cornelius with everyone for years
09-02-2019T22:57:16,MrEase,Nora would impose Raine's fanfics into reality
09-02-2019T22:57:19,BadFoMo,Raine: Uh No! Reni! You've made my Fan-Fics real!
09-02-2019T22:57:28,BadFoMo,Dang It!

09-02-2019T22:57:35,Mippy,Alabaster‚Äôs not so secret crush was very clear
09-02-2019T22:57:40,Ordithus,Alabaster was really bitter when the canon ship was with that western harlot
09-02-2019T22:57:47,unsteddyphoenix,yeah

09-02-2019T22:57:50,w0lfmare,Raine inside one of her fanfics :thinking:
09-02-2019T22:57:57,Dadrobit,"Alabaster is the kind of writer who uses terms like ""turgid length"" unironically."
09-02-2019T22:57:57,CatzArt,Augh it liked me grab some disinfectant grab some iodine!
09-02-2019T22:57:59,unsteddyphoenix,Alabaster is when the shippers go too far

09-02-2019T22:59:25,unsteddyphoenix,At first she starts shipping for justice
09-02-2019T22:59:26,Mippy,Alabastercest?
09-02-2019T22:59:30,unsteddyphoenix,But then she devolved
09-02-2019T22:59:40,unsteddyphoenix,And eventually creates ZenXKat
09-02-2019T22:59:46,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Reee
09-02-2019T23:00:03,unsteddyphoenix,Hmm theres no salt emoji that I can use on myself
09-02-2019T23:00:21,Dadrobit,That's because it's more sugar and spice.
09-02-2019T23:00:34,Mippy,All sketch‚Äôs are just Raines fanfics.

09-02-2019T23:01:59,InuChan,I live on top of a giant salt deposit. So much salt it is virtually an underground city. The salt permeates my soul.
09-02-2019T23:02:22,unsteddyphoenix,I'll be so triggered lol
