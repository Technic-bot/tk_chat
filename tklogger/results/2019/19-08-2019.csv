19-08-2019T00:46:46,AspiringNoodle,Oy....
19-08-2019T00:46:51,AspiringNoodle,Maybe I will go for an air cooler in the future
19-08-2019T00:47:01,AspiringNoodle,My choice of parts is not making cable management any easier...
19-08-2019T00:50:25,AspiringNoodle,"This noodle needs sleep, but bed is covered in computer stuff"

19-08-2019T05:18:41,TerraTheWizard,"interview done, now we wait"
19-08-2019T05:52:12,Justanotheruser7118,So how's it going everyone...?
19-08-2019T06:06:05,RimaDraws,Good just waking up
19-08-2019T06:08:50,Justanotheruser7118,nice
19-08-2019T06:08:59,Justanotheruser7118,I'm gonna sleep in a bit
19-08-2019T06:19:08,Justanotheruser7118,Fairly quiet isn't it
19-08-2019T07:07:19,SomeNiceUser,I’m awake!
19-08-2019T10:49:39,AspiringNoodle,"Computer still half-finished, lol"
19-08-2019T11:18:26,Orthonox,"You got all of your parts, Noodle?"
19-08-2019T11:20:33,AspiringNoodle,Cable management :ptv-unimpressed:
19-08-2019T11:20:54,AspiringNoodle,"Also trying to determine if I damaged my mobo.  For now, I think it's just aesthetic damage"
19-08-2019T11:21:04,AspiringNoodle,"Worst case, I borked a usb type-c header"
19-08-2019T11:22:34,AspiringNoodle,"That aside, hory shit"
19-08-2019T11:22:42,AspiringNoodle,This corsair AIO is NOT cable management friendly
19-08-2019T11:22:53,AspiringNoodle,And this case has so much stuff coming out the front
19-08-2019T11:23:57,AspiringNoodle,"(Btw, the Corsair has 3 different cables coming out of the pump. USB, 3-way fan connector, and fan header connector)"
19-08-2019T11:32:32,Orthonox,Isn't your case spacious?
19-08-2019T11:33:58,AspiringNoodle,"Ironically, that's one of the issues! lol"
19-08-2019T11:34:47,AspiringNoodle,"Had a hell of the time connecting the dual 4+4 pin connectors for CPU power, that'll probably be a pain when I try to get the panel back on"
19-08-2019T11:35:46,AspiringNoodle,"At this point, I'm trying to figure out the fan connections, then I'll tackle the mess that is the front panel stuff"
19-08-2019T11:35:47,Orthonox,Bought any extension cables?
19-08-2019T11:35:52,AspiringNoodle,Nope :c
19-08-2019T11:38:57,Orthonox,Is there an electronics store near you?
19-08-2019T11:40:18,AspiringNoodle,I'm doing some google now :D
19-08-2019T11:40:27,AspiringNoodle,"Also, next time I should go to a Microcenter or something, lol"
19-08-2019T11:40:49,Orthonox,Didn't you say a Microcenter was 2 hours from your house?
19-08-2019T11:41:00,AspiringNoodle,yes
19-08-2019T11:43:32,Orthonox,Microcenter is dope. Just hope the trip will be worth the gas.
19-08-2019T11:44:21,AspiringNoodle,Not with this work schedule :/
19-08-2019T11:45:04,AspiringNoodle,I'm definitely going to get out of retail as soon as I can
19-08-2019T11:45:19,AspiringNoodle,The constant 1 day off after 2 - 3 days of work is annoying as hell
19-08-2019T12:04:58,Orthonox,Do you work full time in those days?
19-08-2019T12:07:15,AspiringNoodle,I work anywhere from 5 - 8 hours
19-08-2019T12:07:29,AspiringNoodle,But a lot of it is standing in place (retail is evil)
19-08-2019T12:16:21,RimaDraws,hiii
19-08-2019T12:18:12,AspiringNoodle,"That aside, I don't think there's much else I can do with the cables coming from the pump :c"
19-08-2019T12:18:17,AspiringNoodle,RIP
19-08-2019T12:18:21,AspiringNoodle,"Also, hi Rima"

19-08-2019T12:32:21,AspiringNoodle,"Alright, cables are done :D"
19-08-2019T12:32:45,AspiringNoodle,Used some twist ties for the fan stuff <3
19-08-2019T12:32:57,AspiringNoodle,"Now to do... the rest of the cables, lol"
19-08-2019T12:41:52,AspiringNoodle,"On the bright side, looks like I won't have to undo the zip-tie for the front-panel cables"
19-08-2019T17:08:55,IronHorseComics,*Appears*
19-08-2019T17:18:23,IronHorseComics,"twokinds amino, is that a forum?"

19-08-2019T18:03:12,IronHorseComics,and I just learned something terrible
19-08-2019T18:03:38,IronHorseComics,they let JJ Abrams and his son write a Spiderman comic mini-series
19-08-2019T18:03:49,IronHorseComics,and the trailer's out for it
19-08-2019T18:04:40,IronHorseComics,which I can't find now
19-08-2019T18:35:18,CrRAR,Could have just been a very intricate nightmare.
19-08-2019T18:35:44,CrRAR,Your subconscious must be a very sophisticated place.
19-08-2019T18:39:52,IronHorseComics,"noooo I saw a video talking about it, I didn't watch a lot of it but there it was"
19-08-2019T18:41:06,CrRAR,okok
19-08-2019T18:41:48,IronHorseComics,just seeing one image is enough to give me nightmares
19-08-2019T19:25:25,SpazztasticKiwi,watching someone play the sims and his sim just gave birth
19-08-2019T19:25:31,SpazztasticKiwi,triplets

19-08-2019T19:38:35,SpazztasticKiwi,but triplets happened so that went out the window
19-08-2019T19:38:56,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s got me actually interested in the sims 4
19-08-2019T19:39:20,SpazztasticKiwi,not the spontaneous triplets thing but the rest of the chaos that you can do
19-08-2019T19:39:28,RimaDraws,yea lol
19-08-2019T19:41:42,SpazztasticKiwi,I like how two of the girls are red heads like mom and dad but the third is blonde
19-08-2019T19:41:50,SpazztasticKiwi,how
19-08-2019T19:41:57,IronHorseComics,because Sims
19-08-2019T19:42:15,IronHorseComics,"now, question, what would be a good word sound effect for an unlocking car door?"
19-08-2019T19:42:50,SpazztasticKiwi,click
19-08-2019T19:43:05,SpazztasticKiwi,or some cars go thump
19-08-2019T19:43:19,SpazztasticKiwi,of bleep
19-08-2019T19:43:20,IronHorseComics,thump sounds good
19-08-2019T19:43:22,SpazztasticKiwi,or
19-08-2019T19:43:56,SpazztasticKiwi,and then you’ve also got the honkhonk ones that you hear in parking lots
19-08-2019T19:44:25,SpazztasticKiwi,"first time you hear that,  it’s locked no need to hit the button another four times"
19-08-2019T19:44:36,SpazztasticKiwi,KaReN
19-08-2019T19:44:50,IronHorseComics,"right, the character's unlocking it from inside the car so thump is the way to go it seems"
19-08-2019T19:45:22,SpazztasticKiwi,I have somehow come in contact with green glitter
19-08-2019T19:45:37,SpazztasticKiwi,??

19-08-2019T19:51:22,SpazztasticKiwi,unless a fairy was running laps earlier there’s no way I touched glitter
19-08-2019T19:53:28,CrRAR,Maybe you were visited by a leprechaun.
19-08-2019T19:53:44,CrRAR,A very tardy leprechaun.
19-08-2019T19:57:31,RimaDraws,lol

19-08-2019T22:01:24,AspiringNoodle,"Well, 2 weeks in, and the pain only keeps getting worse"
19-08-2019T22:08:10,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve noticed something about Bagheera’s “popcorn jumping”
19-08-2019T22:08:42,SpazztasticKiwi,he jumps over the doorway line of the bathroom and the heater
19-08-2019T22:09:55,SpazztasticKiwi,logic of cat
