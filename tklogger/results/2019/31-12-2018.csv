31-12-2018T01:25:14,RimaDraws,^^
31-12-2018T01:38:12,bignibbahours,how many s's are in egg's name?
31-12-2018T01:56:30,xcvb,by this time I have no idea
31-12-2018T02:01:09,Dadrobit,Happy New Year!
31-12-2018T02:02:34,xcvb,Happy new year Dadro!!
31-12-2018T02:15:48,Dadrobit,It's been raining all day and folks are feeling bold. Dam near everyone around here has some real deal mortars they're setting off.
31-12-2018T02:16:32,Dadrobit,"Usually living in the desert, most folks just stick to bottle rockets and mini mortars."
31-12-2018T02:17:41,Dadrobit,"With the rain, folks are throwing caution to the wind. My pops included. Just got finished with our own we bought down in Mexico a few years back."
31-12-2018T02:26:55,unsteddyphoenix,Sounds like a lot of fun~
31-12-2018T02:28:20,xcvb,yeah
31-12-2018T02:32:33,xcvb,but it sounds better than 3rd year in a row with a mist just at this night
31-12-2018T02:39:37,Dadrobit,"Yeah, the rain stopped maybe 15 minutes before midnight, so it was just kind of perfect. Only a bit of fog and everything is rather very wet."
31-12-2018T02:40:12,Dadrobit,Almost 40 minutes later and mortars are still going off. Folks are just unloading their caches they've been building up.
31-12-2018T02:41:27,Dadrobit,Rain is unfortunately just so rare that fire hazard warnings and fines for getting caught setting off real deal fireworks means we never get to do this kind of fun.
31-12-2018T02:42:40,xcvb,"don't worry, here it ended at 3AM"
31-12-2018T02:44:23,Dadrobit,"I don't mind at all. I love watching fireworks. It's a bit chilly outside, but it hasn't gotten down to freezing temps just yet. Still 42F. (6C)"
31-12-2018T02:46:50,xcvb,"same temp. here, I'd like to watch some fireworks too, but local weather is trolling hard, also it's almost 9AM"
31-12-2018T02:47:15,Dadrobit,"My voice is shot to shit from being sick the last few days, so it's not like I was getting any work done tonight anyways."
31-12-2018T02:49:40,xcvb,have you seen the doc.?
31-12-2018T02:53:10,Dadrobit,It's just a head cold. I'm 75% over it.
31-12-2018T02:57:40,xcvb,"3/4 over, 1/4 to go, sounds like an RPG quest ^^"
31-12-2018T02:59:21,Dadrobit,I have plenty in Charisma. But my Constitution is evidently quite crap.
31-12-2018T02:59:48,xcvb,and I'm all out of mana potion :(
31-12-2018T03:05:07,xcvb,"but have faith, Tom's new years resolution is to draw a page sketch every day in this year"

31-12-2018T05:23:34,Bgrmystr2,4:23am lol
31-12-2018T05:23:50,Bgrmystr2,I don't usually sleep till 5 or 6am
31-12-2018T05:24:03,CrimsonQuill,Good Grief.
31-12-2018T05:24:18,CrimsonQuill,And I thought I was bad staying up until 2am watching streams...
31-12-2018T05:24:33,CrimsonQuill,"Oh, that's one of my Resolutions-I will only stay up really late for streams."
31-12-2018T05:24:39,CrimsonQuill,Because...they're streams.
31-12-2018T05:25:05,Bgrmystr2,"naw I'm just up late at night. I don't need to be up in the morning for anything, and most people I know as well as things I do work better if I'm awake in the afternoon and night."
31-12-2018T05:25:31,Bgrmystr2,"also, I struggle waking up in any manner at all, Not to mention I sleep like a brick."
31-12-2018T05:25:58,CrimsonQuill,"I have my alarm set for 6:30, but every morning the bed's so comfy..."
31-12-2018T05:26:12,CrimsonQuill,I'm getting better at getting up when the alrm rings though.
31-12-2018T05:26:25,Bgrmystr2,"so there's no point trying to try to wake up early. I fought it my whole life and failed. At this point, I wrap my schedule around doing things that make more sense"
31-12-2018T05:26:50,CrimsonQuill,My schedule is already in place.
31-12-2018T05:26:51,CrimsonQuill,Study.
31-12-2018T05:26:54,CrimsonQuill,And lots of it.

31-12-2018T17:21:48,Dadrobit,What do you mean Bgr? Nightcore isn't just speeding up popular songs and adding over the top EQ after a pitch shift for a video with slightly edgy anime girl pictures???
31-12-2018T17:22:05,Bgrmystr2,No. It's not. xD
31-12-2018T17:22:09,Dadrobit,Lies
31-12-2018T17:22:09,Bgrmystr2,mr sarcasm
31-12-2018T17:22:22,Bgrmystr2,"You broke my detector, it was brand new"
31-12-2018T17:22:56,Bgrmystr2,"definitely not lies, I watched it happen even"
31-12-2018T17:26:34,Dadrobit,"You know. One could argue that nightcore is just that now. The definition of what a thing is does change over time. Like how people associate ""Hurt"" With Johnny Cash, ""The Man Who Sold The World"" with Nirvana, ""Nimrod"" means idiot, etc..."
31-12-2018T17:27:16,Bgrmystr2,the first two don't make a fuck of sense to me lol xD
31-12-2018T17:27:26,Bgrmystr2,and I know that
31-12-2018T17:27:58,Bgrmystr2,but noone seems to know the band of which they're just ripping off and disrespecting for the memes at this point
31-12-2018T17:28:07,Bgrmystr2,or at least most don't.
31-12-2018T17:28:14,Dadrobit,"It's not disrespect, it is just what it is at this point."
31-12-2018T17:28:48,Bgrmystr2,it absolutely is
31-12-2018T17:29:12,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: Though I'd argue it's probably unintentional for the most part
31-12-2018T17:29:13,iliar,"Technically, I would like to see Maddie's face from second frame in color. https://www.patreon.com/posts/magical-mishaps-23421341 , but use Nora Card only for this...."
31-12-2018T17:29:41,Dadrobit,"""Hurt"" is an incredibly popular cover song from Johnny Cash that originally came from Nine Inch Nails. Nirvana covered ""The Man Who Sold The World"". Those covers are no longer associated with the original artists almost at all anymore."
31-12-2018T17:30:09,Dadrobit,"Same thing happened with Disturbed ""Sound of Silence"" coever."
31-12-2018T17:30:12,Dadrobit,cover*
31-12-2018T17:30:23,iliar,It would be nice if Tom had a cheap version of the Nora Cards for simple things.
31-12-2018T17:30:32,Bgrmystr2,Those are covers though. They're intentionally covering and paying respect and redoing the original songs in a new style. :u
31-12-2018T17:31:33,Bgrmystr2,"The nightcore thing is just people speeding songs up for the memes. They don't care if there's a band that it came from, hell, if they even knew at all, they just see a bunch of badly sped up songs to cringe videos and do it themselves"
31-12-2018T17:31:55,Dadrobit,"And ""Nightcore"" variants are just that. Altered versions. Styles. You may not like it, but this is what peak producer performance looks like."
31-12-2018T17:32:04,iliar,For example I don't like this sketch https://yadi.sk/i/lu1uEFIvREytnA but Maid Nibs is top.
31-12-2018T17:35:27,Bgrmystr2,"that's not paying reference to the band, it's just ripping off the band's shtick while using the meme to make fun of how it sounds. There's a reason the band was drowned out by the meme."
31-12-2018T17:36:02,Dadrobit,Because the meme is superior. It all makes sense now.
31-12-2018T17:36:40,Bgrmystr2,Inferior = superior.. ? The sarcasm is real. :u
31-12-2018T17:41:17,Xexanoth,"@iliar i doubt there is enough demand for those ""simple"" things to warrant tom making it a thing. :/"
31-12-2018T17:44:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d donate maybe $10ish for a smartass request
31-12-2018T17:44:25,SpazztasticKiwi,“Draw the most detailed stick person you can”
31-12-2018T17:44:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Just to see what he’d do with it
31-12-2018T17:44:50,Xexanoth,just make it a suggestion and people willl vote it for the lulz
31-12-2018T17:45:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I already have a sketch to re request this round since it did well but not win last time

31-12-2018T22:53:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe I’ll actually go to momocon
31-12-2018T22:53:50,unsteddyphoenix,A cat or gf. Either is good
31-12-2018T22:54:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Or maybe it’ll be another lone year

31-12-2018T22:55:21,unsteddyphoenix,Underdtandable havr a nice cat
31-12-2018T22:55:52,SpazztasticKiwi,But now I can’t reach other cat
31-12-2018T22:56:39,unsteddyphoenix,Hes really asserted dominance
31-12-2018T22:57:05,SpazztasticKiwi,He’s a jealous brat is what he is
31-12-2018T22:57:59,SpazztasticKiwi,But that’s enough about em
31-12-2018T22:58:10,unsteddyphoenix,Thats endearing tbh
31-12-2018T22:58:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I saw a guy from high school today
31-12-2018T22:59:18,SpazztasticKiwi,He seemed to be giving me the “do I remember you” look for awhile
31-12-2018T23:00:29,unsteddyphoenix,Did he work it out?
31-12-2018T23:01:13,SpazztasticKiwi,I dunno. Didn’t say anything other than “so hows you’re day been?” I had glasses in high school so I look different. Not to mention I lost pounds between then
31-12-2018T23:01:47,SpazztasticKiwi,But I remember him and his voice. I didn’t figure he liked me that much
31-12-2018T23:02:54,unsteddyphoenix,Have you had a makeover since then like in those girl movies?
31-12-2018T23:03:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Other than the glasses and weight loss no. I’ve never worn makeup much
31-12-2018T23:03:47,SpazztasticKiwi,As far as I know I look he same
31-12-2018T23:03:50,SpazztasticKiwi,the

31-12-2018T23:14:58,unsteddyphoenix,Ive done like 1.5 rough sketches
31-12-2018T23:16:10,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve sorta started a short story
31-12-2018T23:16:18,SpazztasticKiwi,And have no idea what I’m doing
31-12-2018T23:16:24,RimaDraws,^^
