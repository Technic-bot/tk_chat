03-09-2019T00:17:08,Dadrobit,I have legitimately no idea what I'll be doing for that.

03-09-2019T07:53:48,FloofyCat,"To chime in on the hot wings thing, people should really use a scoville rating and try and make it mainstream. I've had some food described as hot that, in reality, was mild as a friggin' bell pepper. Okay obviously ""HOT"" wings is a tip-off but tbh"
03-09-2019T07:57:05,FloofyCat,"people who ask that are probably just wondering if there is actually any kick to it or not. If someone asked me I'd probably just say ""oh its just a cayenne powder coating"" or ""yeah it was marinaded in habanero sauce"" or something"
03-09-2019T09:53:15,AspiringNoodle,A good comparison would be a jalapeno pepper
03-09-2019T09:54:19,AspiringNoodle,"The range is much wider, but they tend to be in the 3,000 - 5,000 scovilles range"

03-09-2019T16:46:13,TerraTheWizard,if you need an answer you could send an email

03-09-2019T16:46:54,TerraTheWizard,or you could ask on the forum i guess
03-09-2019T16:47:05,CrimsonQuill,I might send an email
03-09-2019T16:47:07,CrimsonQuill,thanks
03-09-2019T16:48:11,CrimsonQuill,But I am still hoping he might be here
