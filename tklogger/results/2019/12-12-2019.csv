12-12-2019T22:37:19,BadFoMo,Yo?
12-12-2019T22:37:26,NezumiYuki,Holy Crap Tom... I thought that was only gonna be a simple Pepperoni Pizza.   That's more like a Supreme!
12-12-2019T22:37:40,InTheLionsDen,Nothing but the best at the mansion.
12-12-2019T22:38:09,KeefMcDerpface,Better than bacon rapped pizza?
12-12-2019T22:38:22,KeefMcDerpface,Yes that's a thing.
12-12-2019T22:38:28,ShamusTheFox,Stuffed crust for the win.
12-12-2019T22:38:38,NezumiYuki,OMFG Bacon Cheeseburger Pizza!   HUBBY!!!!  ORDER ONE RIGHT NOW!
12-12-2019T22:38:40,FloofyCat,I make pizzas a ton.
12-12-2019T22:38:45,FloofyCat,Stuffed Crust is easy to make.
12-12-2019T22:39:05,FloofyCat,I don't know an international name so I'll say Pizza Hut cheesy bites are easy to make too.
12-12-2019T22:39:06,CrRAR,"insert cheese, roll it over?"
12-12-2019T22:39:09,JojoF2415,I forgot how to make pizza dough
12-12-2019T22:39:17,FloofyCat,Ummm kinda @CrRAR
12-12-2019T22:39:45,MviluUatusun,"Well, it's bedtime for me to head off to bed.  I'll see y'all later."
12-12-2019T22:39:51,JojoF2415,Gn
12-12-2019T22:39:51,CrRAR,bye mvilu
12-12-2019T22:39:51,Ordithus,NIght Mvilu
12-12-2019T22:39:59,NezumiYuki,Aww nite nite Mvilu
12-12-2019T22:40:07,FloofyCat,"Thin out the outer edge of the crust, get a block of mozzarella and chop it into tubes, then you roll it and just make sure it is properly sealed, or it'll leak."
12-12-2019T22:40:11,KeefMcDerpface,Night Mvilu
12-12-2019T22:40:21,JojoF2415,I‚Äôm a bit scared going to sleep
12-12-2019T22:40:25,CrRAR,yes a fine pizza making art
12-12-2019T22:40:26,JulesLetters,Bedtime for me too. Have a lovely evening y'all!
12-12-2019T22:40:27,TheFreindlyDeathclaw,Night Mvilu
12-12-2019T22:40:28,FloofyCat,"You need to thin out the outer edge or it'll puff out a lot, and push all the topping inwards."
12-12-2019T22:40:29,MuonNeutrino,could also just use string cheese
12-12-2019T22:40:35,TheFreindlyDeathclaw,Night Jules
12-12-2019T22:40:38,FloofyCat,And you just have this massive stuffed crust that is mostly crust.
12-12-2019T22:40:43,Ordithus,Night Jules
12-12-2019T22:40:43,KeefMcDerpface,bye Jules
12-12-2019T22:40:44,CrRAR,ah
12-12-2019T22:40:47,NezumiYuki,G'night Jules
12-12-2019T22:41:03,ShamusTheFox,Interesting. I learned something!
12-12-2019T22:41:04,FloofyCat,"String cheese works, I've tried that, but it's expensive if you can only get branded string cheese and otherwise it is nowhere near as nice as actual mozzarella cheese in there."
12-12-2019T22:41:25,FloofyCat,Bonus: Put chilli in the crust.
12-12-2019T22:41:41,CrRAR,"yeah, real fresh mozzarella there's no substitute"
12-12-2019T22:41:59,FloofyCat,"Bonus 2: Cut the stuffed crust with a knife, turn it 90 degrees right, then you have cheesy bites!"
12-12-2019T22:42:06,MuonNeutrino,"eh, isn't the fresh stuff usually got too much moisture?"
12-12-2019T22:42:37,CrRAR,I think there's a compromise point.
12-12-2019T22:42:40,FloofyCat,"Bonus 3: Mix some olive oil and dried powdered cayenne pepper, once it is half-cooked, put your chilli oil mixture and use a pastry brush to brush all the cheesy bites."
12-12-2019T22:42:48,NezumiYuki,"You guys watch!   All this talk about pizza, and Tom will be chewing on some this Sunday stream as a result!   xD"
12-12-2019T22:43:04,FloofyCat,That separates it from fast food pizza to tasty-as-heckin'-heck pizza.

12-12-2019T23:17:17,FloofyCat,That's pretty great.
12-12-2019T23:17:20,MuonNeutrino,so you could say it was a punishing encounter?

12-12-2019T23:17:42,FloofyCat,@AnuSekaniArt Should make it so if the pun is good enough it physically knocks the players off their feet.

12-12-2019T23:19:56,MuonNeutrino,"i think Tom once said that the thing flora was recounting was a time she ate *just* bread, and that they don't get sick if they eat it in smaller quantities"
12-12-2019T23:20:11,MuonNeutrino,also tigers may not be the same as wolves in that regard

12-12-2019T23:33:42,RimaDraws,i am just listening to some christmas music while i sit and relax
12-12-2019T23:34:05,TheFreindlyDeathclaw,im playing assassins creed odyssey
12-12-2019T23:34:18,KeefMcDerpface,Are those snow covered mountains in the background?
12-12-2019T23:34:28,MuonNeutrino,"clouds, i think"
12-12-2019T23:34:30,CrRAR,maybe a cloudwall
12-12-2019T23:34:33,CrRAR,yeah
12-12-2019T23:34:41,BeeMill,Unpopular opinion but Assassins creed black flag is my favorite
12-12-2019T23:34:49,CrRAR,yarrr
12-12-2019T23:34:52,KeefMcDerpface,Now I see the clouds.
12-12-2019T23:35:08,TheFreindlyDeathclaw,Never played black flag
12-12-2019T23:35:26,SageSaga,how is that unpopular?
12-12-2019T23:35:32,KeefMcDerpface,Black flag was pirates right?
12-12-2019T23:35:36,BeeMill,yeah
12-12-2019T23:35:37,CrRAR,yes quite a powerful sunset
12-12-2019T23:35:40,SageSaga,everyone i hear mention Assassins Creed says Black Flag was the best
12-12-2019T23:35:46,steelabjur,I thought it was considered one of the better ones?
12-12-2019T23:35:53,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Black flag is the best imo
12-12-2019T23:35:54,BeeMill,"I thought black flag wasn‚Äôt a fan favorite, am I wrong?"
12-12-2019T23:36:02,SageSaga,you are very wrong
12-12-2019T23:36:09,BeeMill,Haha
12-12-2019T23:36:15,CrRAR,souns like a cult fav at least by the response here
12-12-2019T23:36:30,AspiringNoodle,...Is tom the reincarnation of a Studio Ghibli animator or something?
12-12-2019T23:36:37,AspiringNoodle,That piza looks too good...
12-12-2019T23:36:40,MarvTheHugPharaoh,When it comes to the AC games.  The less Assassins stuff the better.
12-12-2019T23:36:47,BeeMill,Well guess it‚Äôs good that it‚Äôs more widely liked than I thought
12-12-2019T23:36:54,steelabjur,"Now, if your favorite was the one set during the Revolution with the Native American assassin, that would be an unpopular opinion."
12-12-2019T23:37:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,AC 3 is better then unity or syndicate
12-12-2019T23:37:27,SpazztasticKiwi,isn‚Äôt studio ghibli Japanese
12-12-2019T23:37:28,TheFreindlyDeathclaw,Assassins creed 3 is american one
12-12-2019T23:37:32,KeefMcDerpface,2 and black flag are the best from what I remember.
12-12-2019T23:37:38,Sclimshady,Tom is putting in the important details first
12-12-2019T23:38:08,BeeMill,The entire fun of black flag was the whole pirate schtick. Everyone fast traveled but I loved sailing with my crew singing n shit
12-12-2019T23:38:38,NezumiYuki,"Yeah Ghibli is Nippon, but until recently....   Now Disney owns a good chunk of not all of, Ghibli.   And that said... Hayou retired as a result.  =("
12-12-2019T23:38:40,TheFreindlyDeathclaw,Oddyssey has ships again
12-12-2019T23:38:42,BeeMill,Honestly I should play it again now that we bring it up
12-12-2019T23:38:51,BeeMill,Not quite the same though
12-12-2019T23:38:59,SageSaga,thats completely wrong Nezumi
12-12-2019T23:39:12,RimaDraws,this is looking good sage
12-12-2019T23:39:17,Ordithus,^
12-12-2019T23:39:18,SageSaga,Disney doesnt own any of Ghibli
12-12-2019T23:39:29,RimaDraws,^
12-12-2019T23:39:33,SageSaga,and had nothing to do with Ghibli going away
12-12-2019T23:39:52,steelabjur,"Sort of like riding horses in RDR and RDR2, loved traveling in those games. Then again, I'm one of those weirdos who drives around in GTA games obaying traffic laws while listening to the radio."
12-12-2019T23:39:56,RimaDraws,the creator was retiring and if i remember he was goign blind
12-12-2019T23:39:58,RimaDraws,going*
12-12-2019T23:40:10,steelabjur,*obeying
12-12-2019T23:40:26,Ordithus,<3 The Wind Rises gotta say

12-12-2019T23:41:25,SpazztasticKiwi,"hey Tom, totally innocent question"
12-12-2019T23:41:30,NezumiYuki,oh wait panel 3 sorry!
12-12-2019T23:41:31,CrRAR,...and Karen appears to have survived the run in with that wall
12-12-2019T23:41:42,RimaDraws,i dont see it
12-12-2019T23:41:52,CrRAR,lil blotches on the beach
12-12-2019T23:41:56,ZRO4825,"After everything /else/ she's survived, I'm pretty sure faceplanting into the invisible wall is the least of her worries. :P"
12-12-2019T23:41:57,SageSaga,Disney doesnt even have rights to the Ghibli movies it worked on anymore
12-12-2019T23:41:57,SpazztasticKiwi,if sythe got a cramp from eating pizza in the pool would Maren give him mouth to mouth
12-12-2019T23:41:59,TheFreindlyDeathclaw,between pillar and maren
12-12-2019T23:42:19,SpazztasticKiwi,only because they‚Äôre good friends of course
12-12-2019T23:42:46,mingun,09:42
12-12-2019T23:42:54,SageSaga,first off- eating and swimming causing cramps is a myth
12-12-2019T23:42:55,SpazztasticKiwi,and I want to eat that sunset
12-12-2019T23:42:57,CrRAR,that would be a wild series of events
12-12-2019T23:43:08,SageSaga,second- you dont give mouth to mouth for a cramp...
12-12-2019T23:43:10,RimaDraws,i still dont see it
12-12-2019T23:43:14,NezumiYuki,"Well that's good to hear Sage!   I need to do more facts digging later, but here I thought the big D was being a usual D and scooping up stuff left and right and Ghibli was one of their purchases."
12-12-2019T23:43:16,SpazztasticKiwi,it
12-12-2019T23:43:24,SpazztasticKiwi,was a joke
12-12-2019T23:43:55,BadFoMo,Ghibli?
12-12-2019T23:44:16,SageSaga,they never bought Ghibli- just the rights to distribute - and it was temporary
12-12-2019T23:44:25,NezumiYuki,Ah!
12-12-2019T23:44:34,NezumiYuki,"And yes Bad, Studio Ghibli"
12-12-2019T23:44:44,MuonNeutrino,"speculation: the 'suddenly explosions' will happen in the middle of the night, and when everyone comes dashing out into the hallway in a panic, maren comes running out of sythe's room rather than her own >.>"
12-12-2019T23:44:59,CrRAR,lol
12-12-2019T23:45:26,BadFoMo,@NezumiYuki What did they make?

12-12-2019T23:46:00,NezumiYuki,Let's see... Studio Ghibli was responsible for making a tonne of good stuff.   Like Spirited Away for example
12-12-2019T23:46:01,steelabjur,"Miyazaki is currently directing a movie for Studio Ghibli entitled ""Kimi-tachi wa D≈ç Ikiru ka"""

12-12-2019T23:47:04,SageSaga,there are better food drawings in anime than Ghibli's
12-12-2019T23:47:11,AspiringNoodle,I've been partaking in Studio Ghibli Fest 2019 :ptv-uneasy:

12-12-2019T23:50:35,MuonNeutrino,maren's bikini top seems to be changing styles between panels and strips. it keeps going back and forth between having wider red sections going up to her shoulders (like in panel 1 here or in the current comic) and having narrow black straps instead
12-12-2019T23:50:43,maku450,drops a tactical hug bomb on chat
