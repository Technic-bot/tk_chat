01-09-2019T01:21:44,AspiringNoodle,I really hope I don't have strep throat...
01-09-2019T01:23:26,SpazztasticKiwi,I put a piece of tape on Bagheeras head and I think I broke him
01-09-2019T01:24:00,AspiringNoodle,pics
01-09-2019T02:33:31,AspiringNoodle,Looks like I'm going to an urgent care clinic today
01-09-2019T02:37:04,AspiringNoodle,There's a pretty good chance I have strep throat

01-09-2019T05:49:16,AspiringNoodle,Why didn't I do this sooner?
01-09-2019T05:49:31,AspiringNoodle,Swapped out my shorts / short socks for sweat pants / long socks and threw on my one hoodie
01-09-2019T05:49:36,AspiringNoodle,I feel so comfy right now -w-
01-09-2019T07:41:05,TeapotOfDoom,This kid at kfc just got up and started fortnite dancing
01-09-2019T07:42:45,TeapotOfDoom,Can't say if i m impressed by the courage or annoyed by the fact that it was fortnite
01-09-2019T07:54:08,SomeNiceUser,Probably both Teapot.

01-09-2019T08:57:55,TeapotOfDoom,Hi!
01-09-2019T08:58:08,CrimsonQuill,...Hello
01-09-2019T08:58:14,CrimsonQuill,:ptv-scratch::ptv-greetings:
01-09-2019T08:58:45,TeapotOfDoom,Cottage pie sounds like cottage cheese to me. But i guess its something completely different
01-09-2019T08:59:17,CrimsonQuill,It's Shepherd's pie with Beef instead of Lamb.
01-09-2019T09:06:10,CrimsonQuill,I'm making the potato mash soon
01-09-2019T09:18:57,AspiringNoodle,Ow my throat...
01-09-2019T09:19:08,AspiringNoodle,"So good / bad news, don't have strep throat (as of the instant test)"
01-09-2019T09:19:18,AspiringNoodle,But I do have some nasty bacterial infection in the same region
01-09-2019T09:19:45,AspiringNoodle,Doctor didn't even look in my mouth for a second before she said it was bad.  Really red with white spots
01-09-2019T09:21:07,AspiringNoodle,"So, now, in addition to the anti-bacterial meds I got, I've also got hot chocolate, honey, and hot wings for when I'm feeling better :3"
01-09-2019T09:25:15,CrimsonQuill,We've had infections like that before in our family. They are really nasty...
01-09-2019T09:30:34,RimaDraws,morning

01-09-2019T09:31:02,RimaDraws,hi quill
01-09-2019T09:36:15,CrimsonQuill,...hullo...
01-09-2019T10:02:21,SomeNiceUser,Hope you get better Noodle.
01-09-2019T10:06:28,SomeNiceUser,Iâ€™m still thinking about pizza.
01-09-2019T10:11:09,SomeNiceUser,"Couldnâ€™t be worse than breaking a bone in your hand, I broke my writing hand earlier this year."
01-09-2019T10:52:40,CrimsonQuill,Shepherd's pie is in the oven...let's see how it turns out.

01-09-2019T11:26:15,SomeNiceUser,Hey hover!
01-09-2019T11:26:53,SomeNiceUser,My pizza thirst has been quenched.
01-09-2019T11:35:22,SomeNiceUser,"Hey guys, what are your thoughts on the incoming intel 10th gen cpus?"
01-09-2019T11:37:39,AspiringNoodle,misleading
01-09-2019T11:39:41,SomeNiceUser,Seems like so.
01-09-2019T11:39:49,SomeNiceUser,"Canâ€™t wait to get my new laptop, itâ€™s coming in a few days."
01-09-2019T11:40:03,AspiringNoodle,"In particular, the problems come with the % claims of performance / battery life"
01-09-2019T11:40:53,AspiringNoodle,Since they're comparing boost vs base for performance claims and slowest vs fastest for battery life
01-09-2019T11:41:40,AspiringNoodle,"On top of that, 10nm will only have 4c/8t available at most.  Meanwhile 14nm will have 6c/12t cpus available"
01-09-2019T11:41:52,AspiringNoodle,"So if you need more cores, 14nm is actually the better performer"
01-09-2019T11:43:34,SomeNiceUser,You do have a solid point Noodle.
01-09-2019T11:44:20,SomeNiceUser,More cores means better better multitasking.
01-09-2019T11:44:37,SomeNiceUser,In terms of programs.
01-09-2019T11:46:42,SomeNiceUser,"Also, do you have a tips when first using Clip Paint Studio?"
01-09-2019T11:51:19,SomeNiceUser,I just want to know how to setup a tablet.
01-09-2019T11:52:44,AspiringNoodle,"Ummm, I'll let  you know when I get my tablet plugged back into my computer xD"
01-09-2019T11:53:32,SomeNiceUser,Lol alright then.

01-09-2019T15:17:17,AspiringNoodle,"Throat's starting to feel a tad better, man those anti-biotics work fast"
01-09-2019T16:22:31,SpazztasticKiwi,not much of a need for play by play updates
01-09-2019T16:23:07,SpazztasticKiwi,watch yourself and focus on getting better and monitor that fever
01-09-2019T16:36:19,AspiringNoodle,fever's more or less non-critical :3
01-09-2019T16:39:11,AspiringNoodle,So... did Bagheera.exe ever recover?
01-09-2019T18:22:27,HoverdudeXL,hi

01-09-2019T19:12:06,Mikemkke034,How're you
01-09-2019T19:12:32,CrRAR,"hi, good"
01-09-2019T19:12:49,CrRAR,evening's just winding down
01-09-2019T19:25:06,AspiringNoodle,"Ugh... idk what's worse, having to pay $180 today between the doctor's visit and the antibiotics (and potentially needing to go back again on wednesday)"
01-09-2019T19:25:13,AspiringNoodle,Or paying who knows how much for health insurance
01-09-2019T19:26:29,CrRAR,With High Deductible health plans you don't have to choose!
01-09-2019T19:26:36,CrRAR,It's ALL expensive!
01-09-2019T19:26:40,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-keith8D:
01-09-2019T19:26:59,AspiringNoodle,"So, I have the potential to pay for the same coverage I had under my parent's plan"
01-09-2019T19:27:11,AspiringNoodle,"$5 a month for vision, I think $43 or so for dental"
01-09-2019T19:27:22,AspiringNoodle,But then a whopping $843 and change for medical
01-09-2019T19:37:42,Mikemkke034,:yum:
01-09-2019T19:40:09,AspiringNoodle,"Also, these pills will start working when? xD"
01-09-2019T19:40:15,AspiringNoodle,I'm 3 hours out from pill 3 -_-
01-09-2019T19:41:07,AspiringNoodle,"I'm tired of having to cough up stuff every 10 - 15 minutes, it being painful and leaving my throat feeling raw for the next minute or two"
01-09-2019T19:47:40,SomeNiceUser,That sucks.
01-09-2019T19:55:21,SomeNiceUser,But the amount of money that you have to pay for medical is staggering.
01-09-2019T19:57:38,AspiringNoodle,"On the bright side, the pills were cheap xD"
01-09-2019T19:57:41,AspiringNoodle,$11 and change
01-09-2019T19:59:05,SomeNiceUser,Thatâ€™s great!
01-09-2019T20:00:10,AspiringNoodle,So the doctor's note said I was cleared for regular activity starting the 4th.  I doubt I'll be that far along at this rate :ptv-unimpressed:
01-09-2019T20:00:29,SomeNiceUser,Slow metabolism?
01-09-2019T20:00:47,AspiringNoodle,"Nah, I basically need 2 things to happen"
01-09-2019T20:00:53,AspiringNoodle,"Throat to heal, voice to return"
01-09-2019T20:01:27,AspiringNoodle,"Unless I'm dramatically better tomorrow, 1 probably ain't happening. And if 1 ain't happening, then neither is 2"
01-09-2019T20:02:13,SomeNiceUser,"Ah, thatâ€™s good to know."
01-09-2019T20:02:42,SomeNiceUser,"Also, howâ€™s your newly built pc Noodle?"
01-09-2019T20:02:47,AspiringNoodle,zippy~

01-09-2019T20:03:33,AspiringNoodle,I limited RGB to the motherboard as much as I could
01-09-2019T20:03:53,AspiringNoodle,"So I've got GPU, CPU cooler, RAM, and mobo itself.  Only other thing with RGB are the fans"

01-09-2019T20:04:23,SomeNiceUser,Thatâ€™s very colory.
01-09-2019T20:04:50,AspiringNoodle,"Err, the intake case fans*"
01-09-2019T20:04:58,AspiringNoodle,Two 200mm fans in the front of the case are aRGB

01-09-2019T20:05:13,SomeNiceUser,Nice.
01-09-2019T20:05:21,CrRAR,gat dem big spinners
01-09-2019T20:06:32,SomeNiceUser,Iâ€™m getting a very decent MSI GL73 later this week.
01-09-2019T20:06:57,SomeNiceUser,Had to settle for less.
01-09-2019T20:07:48,SomeNiceUser,"I heard very good reviews for it, notably the cooling."
01-09-2019T20:09:07,SomeNiceUser,"Three fans, plus a big cooling pad on the cpu."
01-09-2019T20:10:53,SomeNiceUser,Should keep the laptop at around 30-40 degrees Celsius.
01-09-2019T20:11:18,SomeNiceUser,Not counting the cpu.
01-09-2019T20:11:45,SomeNiceUser,Was it a good choice Noodle?
01-09-2019T20:13:21,AspiringNoodle,the parts for my build?
01-09-2019T20:14:15,SomeNiceUser,"I was talking about my laptop choice, but also yes when you mention it."
01-09-2019T20:20:16,AspiringNoodle,"At 30 - 40 C, that's a very good laptop"
01-09-2019T20:25:57,SomeNiceUser,"It has a 9th gen i7 cpu, a RTX 2060, plus 16gb of ram."
01-09-2019T20:27:16,SomeNiceUser,"Not the best, but it gets the job done, probably."
01-09-2019T20:29:06,SomeNiceUser,"The storage needs lots of work on, it has on"
01-09-2019T20:29:19,SomeNiceUser,only 512gb.
01-09-2019T20:29:57,SomeNiceUser,Plus the battery life is pretty short.
01-09-2019T20:30:46,SomeNiceUser,So itâ€™s perfect for the people who are casually gaming around.
01-09-2019T20:33:31,SomeNiceUser,"Iâ€™m gonna catch some sleep, gotta wake up tomorrow, good night everyone!"
