14-01-2019T01:13:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Also saw this clip of a movie with a tsunami. Some people want to go looking for ocean as it disappeared from the shore
14-01-2019T01:14:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Do not go looking for ocean if it disappears. Ocean not lost. Ocean is rearing back to kick you very hard in the nuts

14-01-2019T14:40:13,CrimsonQuill,?
14-01-2019T14:40:21,TerraTheWizard,yes
14-01-2019T14:40:29,TerraTheWizard,quite a lot actually
14-01-2019T14:40:36,CrimsonQuill,Ok...]
14-01-2019T14:40:51,CrimsonQuill,It's just you seem to be up a majority of the time on the chat.
14-01-2019T14:41:02,TerraTheWizard,"well, we're in the same timezone"
14-01-2019T14:41:16,CrimsonQuill,That might go some way to explaining things...
14-01-2019T14:41:39,CrimsonQuill,"So, the sketch streams start at 9:00pm for you, too?"
14-01-2019T14:41:43,TerraTheWizard,ja
14-01-2019T14:41:56,CrimsonQuill,Ceart go leor.
14-01-2019T14:42:24,TerraTheWizard,"i usually clock out around 12:30-1am, just before sketch 7"
14-01-2019T14:42:33,CrimsonQuill,Similar here.
14-01-2019T14:42:50,CrimsonQuill,"Either that, or shortly after the poll with my suggestion's come up."
14-01-2019T14:43:17,CrimsonQuill,I watched some bits of the stream I'd missed on the video...
14-01-2019T14:43:29,CrimsonQuill,You guys were right about me missing Clovis...
14-01-2019T14:43:31,CrimsonQuill,Jeepers.

14-01-2019T14:44:09,CrimsonQuill,What was that thing that she messed about with?
14-01-2019T14:55:17,Twokinds,I don't know
14-01-2019T14:56:23,CrimsonQuill,It's like the Calvin and Hobbes Noodle incident.
14-01-2019T14:56:30,CrimsonQuill,Maybe it's better just to imagine it.
14-01-2019T14:56:44,CrimsonQuill,And let the insanity form in our heads...#

14-01-2019T14:57:49,CrimsonQuill,Maybe she saw a shiny crystal with a don't touch sign on it.
14-01-2019T14:57:57,CrimsonQuill,Terry pratchett sums it up best:
14-01-2019T14:58:24,CrimsonQuill,"Some humans would do anything to see if it was possible to do it. If you put a large switch in some cave somewhere, with a sign on it saying 'End-of-the-World Switch. PLEASE DO NOT TOUCH', the paint wouldn't even have time to dry"
14-01-2019T14:58:51,CrimsonQuill,"Of course, a Red vs Blue Easter egg from Halo 4 puts it just as well..."
14-01-2019T14:59:03,CrimsonQuill,Caboose: What does this button do?

14-01-2019T15:00:03,TerraTheWizard,"""do not climb"" is an invitation to climb"
14-01-2019T15:00:10,CrimsonQuill,It might've been something like that...
14-01-2019T15:00:22,CrimsonQuill,She looks rather cute as a keidran though.
14-01-2019T15:00:32,CrimsonQuill,"Mind, almost anyone in the comic does...."
14-01-2019T15:00:56,CrimsonQuill,"And since she already had a tail, it can't have been too different..."
14-01-2019T15:01:00,TerraTheWizard,floof adds a +20 cuteness buff

14-01-2019T15:01:46,CrimsonQuill,I think the Nibblybot might've made a mistake.

14-01-2019T15:05:51,TerraTheWizard,i need to actually think up a fun character-o-vision sketch idea

14-01-2019T16:24:03,CrimsonQuill,Give or take a decade....
14-01-2019T16:24:04,TerraTheWizard,the trick is to not die before 2062

14-01-2019T16:27:13,SpazztasticKiwi,left
14-01-2019T16:27:23,CrimsonQuill,9 is a magical number.
14-01-2019T16:27:37,Twokinds,And possibly hold the record for longest running webcomic.
14-01-2019T16:27:38,CrimsonQuill,@Spazztastickiwi Awwww..... your cat loves you that much.
14-01-2019T16:28:11,CrimsonQuill,@Twokinds Imagine if it does go on that length! That'd be both awesome and weird....
14-01-2019T16:28:30,Twokinds,It could happen!
14-01-2019T16:28:45,CrimsonQuill,It could.
14-01-2019T16:28:58,CrimsonQuill,I could see a complete rollover of the cast however...
14-01-2019T16:29:17,CrimsonQuill,It's be really cool if it does.
14-01-2019T16:29:31,CrimsonQuill,"How much of the comic has your brother actually read, btw?"
14-01-2019T16:29:42,CrimsonQuill,Or your mum?

14-01-2019T16:30:04,Twokinds,I dunno
14-01-2019T16:30:18,CrimsonQuill,That's an answer I can take.
14-01-2019T16:30:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Marks admitted to reading like

14-01-2019T16:31:19,CrimsonQuill,Hmmm...
14-01-2019T16:31:30,CrimsonQuill,Never mind. It's nothing.
14-01-2019T16:37:58,Mippy,Mark is a man that owns five ovens
14-01-2019T16:45:38,SpazztasticKiwi,I saw that video
14-01-2019T16:45:54,CrimsonQuill,I haven't watched any of Mark's cooking videos...
14-01-2019T16:45:57,CrimsonQuill,Maybe I should.
14-01-2019T16:46:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Amy’s zoom on Mark adding salt instead of sugar is one of the reasons I adore her so much
14-01-2019T16:52:39,CrimsonQuill,LOL

14-01-2019T19:53:11,Twokinds,Because our costs today have changed so much.

14-01-2019T19:58:35,Twokinds,"So, it would vary, but I imagine building it yourself would be something like 200 gold, + time."
14-01-2019T19:59:21,unsteddyphoenix,Significantly cheaper! Still seems like a lot but
14-01-2019T20:00:39,Dadrobit,"1908 means all hand and horse powered equipment, so construction time would be significantly worse. That being said, Mekkan has that whole Magic thing going for it, so who knows how that could expedite the process."

14-01-2019T20:46:34,unsteddyphoenix,That sounds pretty funny actually
14-01-2019T20:46:40,unsteddyphoenix,in character bloopers
14-01-2019T20:48:20,RimaDraws,THIS IS SPARTA
14-01-2019T20:48:21,RimaDraws,lol
14-01-2019T20:48:30,Dadrobit,"Yeah, had something like that recently. A big Christmas special where all the actors reprized their favorite characters from the year all getting together for an office party."
14-01-2019T20:49:52,Dadrobit,"I got the character from the Halloween special who died after being impaled in an ""unfortunate accident."""
14-01-2019T20:50:34,Dadrobit,"Turns out I was fine though in the end and was able to make it to the office party, with the pole still sticking out through my chest."
14-01-2019T20:51:15,unsteddyphoenix,This sounds like a big thing
14-01-2019T20:51:20,unsteddyphoenix,"What is this podcast, anyway?"
14-01-2019T20:51:21,unsteddyphoenix,Any good?
14-01-2019T20:51:50,Dadrobit,I'd like to think it's pretty good. Just had my one year anniversary with them. They've been around for almost a decade now.
14-01-2019T20:52:19,Dadrobit,It's based off of Reddit and user submitted stories.
14-01-2019T20:53:08,unsteddyphoenix,Honestly sounds pretty interesting
14-01-2019T20:53:20,Dadrobit,"No names though, I use my actual name their, and I'd rather it not be associated to my online pseudonym."

14-01-2019T21:41:33,Twokinds,Drawing fight scenes is hard.
14-01-2019T21:41:40,Twokinds,Drawing big scaley lizards is hard.
14-01-2019T21:42:53,unsteddyphoenix,Just use lots of motion lines and hope for the best
14-01-2019T21:43:16,unsteddyphoenix,The few action scenes that are in twokinds are pretty well done though imo

14-01-2019T22:07:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Sometimes I wonder about Marks choice of commentary

14-01-2019T22:26:00,unsteddyphoenix,Huh...Mark streams different games than what I thought...
14-01-2019T22:26:24,SpazztasticKiwi,He’s just got a bad form of word vomit
14-01-2019T22:29:35,Ordithus,Sometimes I wonder about that boy
14-01-2019T22:31:07,CrRAR,xD
14-01-2019T22:37:42,CrRAR,Just substitute whatever your nearest safety object is.

14-01-2019T22:38:48,Ordithus,He's younger than me
14-01-2019T22:39:03,unsteddyphoenix,the boy aint right...
14-01-2019T22:39:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I forget most of you are older than me
14-01-2019T22:39:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Sometimes I forget he is
14-01-2019T22:40:19,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
14-01-2019T22:40:24,SpazztasticKiwi,But you know he’s been mentioning his upcoming 30th birthday like he’s gonna become a butterfly or something
14-01-2019T22:40:37,CrRAR,As the saying goes... you’re only as old as you... voiceact.
14-01-2019T22:41:24,CrRAR,"lol, beeeeg milestone"
14-01-2019T22:41:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Well the only one of the guys I follow that I can think of right off who is as old as me is Ethan
14-01-2019T22:41:49,SpazztasticKiwi,And I’m only older by a few days. The rest are older by 5-9 years
14-01-2019T22:42:08,SpazztasticKiwi,And half don’t act like it
14-01-2019T22:42:44,Ordithus,It's kinda easy to forget how recently he came into that group
14-01-2019T22:43:29,Ordithus,"Ethan, that is"
14-01-2019T22:44:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Mark’s has him around for the past 3ish years
14-01-2019T22:44:29,SpazztasticKiwi,had
14-01-2019T22:44:42,Ordithus,That's about what I thought
14-01-2019T22:45:34,SpazztasticKiwi,If you’ve ever seen their videos together...
14-01-2019T22:45:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Poetry
14-01-2019T22:46:06,SpazztasticKiwi,They played Mario kart and that’s where Ethan learned about Tom
14-01-2019T22:46:08,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-nibsdance:
14-01-2019T22:46:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Ethan’s also part of the reason a few people thought Tom was dead
14-01-2019T22:47:13,TheBeckoner,Why would they think Tom is dead?
14-01-2019T22:47:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Livestream. Mark’s. Mark kept referencing Tom with past tense words (was/were)
14-01-2019T22:47:41,TheBeckoner,ahh ok
14-01-2019T22:47:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"Ethan pointed it out and commented “what, is your brother dead?”"
14-01-2019T22:47:55,SpazztasticKiwi,And mark ran with it as a joke
14-01-2019T22:48:03,SpazztasticKiwi,And of course a few people believed it
14-01-2019T22:48:15,TheBeckoner,"""yeah Tom died now here's Ethan"""
14-01-2019T22:48:17,Ordithus,Nobody lies on the interwebs
14-01-2019T22:48:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Pretty sure it was Ethan
14-01-2019T22:48:51,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s easy to confuse some fans sometimes
14-01-2019T22:49:05,Twokinds,x_x
14-01-2019T22:49:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Ah. So it’s true
14-01-2019T22:49:18,SpazztasticKiwi,What a shame
14-01-2019T22:49:45,unsteddyphoenix,Rip
14-01-2019T22:50:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Probably some of the reason there was so much confusion when he showed in the candy video
14-01-2019T22:50:42,Ordithus,":ctwokinds-lynnsmile:*[Being dead does not free you from taxes, Tom]"
14-01-2019T22:50:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Preach
14-01-2019T22:51:06,unsteddyphoenix,Weird move pretending that your family's dead but ok :thinking:
14-01-2019T22:51:34,SpazztasticKiwi,He was laughing the entire time. Of course Mark wasn’t serious
14-01-2019T22:52:06,SpazztasticKiwi,But a tiny pocket of people - I saw maybe one for sure in the chat - believed it
14-01-2019T22:52:16,SpazztasticKiwi,And wondered why he wasn’t at the funeral
14-01-2019T22:54:23,SpazztasticKiwi,I do wonder if there’s any that still do even after the appearance. It’s be stupid if Mark had to mention to clear up that Tom is in fact alive
14-01-2019T22:54:31,SpazztasticKiwi,it’d
14-01-2019T22:55:02,Ordithus,Especially considering the joint con appearances...
14-01-2019T22:55:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Somebody gonna go to SDCC and see a ghost

14-01-2019T23:04:29,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t technically have a favorite
14-01-2019T23:04:51,Ordithus,Favorite doesn't have to be fantasy husband/wife

14-01-2019T23:08:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe it’s more like he’s fluffy haired
14-01-2019T23:08:29,Bgrmystr2,That's just judging a book by it's cover though.
14-01-2019T23:09:04,Ordithus,Your ex was also human

14-01-2019T23:10:47,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s just I find Daniels attractive. But he’s fictional and I’ve found my tastes have flipped from what they used to be
14-01-2019T23:11:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Yet I can still say something that is not that taste is attractive
14-01-2019T23:11:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Am I making more sense
14-01-2019T23:11:26,Ordithus,I think I understand
14-01-2019T23:11:29,Ordithus,Maybe
14-01-2019T23:11:31,unsteddyphoenix,So your tastes used to be non-fictional and now theyre fictional.
14-01-2019T23:11:31,Ordithus,Yeah
14-01-2019T23:11:33,unsteddyphoenix,I got it.

14-01-2019T23:12:59,SpazztasticKiwi,I did hear that there’s a rumor my ex has a kid now
14-01-2019T23:13:44,SpazztasticKiwi,I doubt it but if he does it’d be about 4 and we’re still only at our 3 year break up mark. We haven’t hit 4 years apart yet
14-01-2019T23:13:47,SpazztasticKiwi,So
14-01-2019T23:14:15,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-power:
14-01-2019T23:14:29,TheBeckoner,Maybe you got him pregnant
14-01-2019T23:14:30,SpazztasticKiwi,It’d mean something I’d rather not find to be true
14-01-2019T23:14:51,SpazztasticKiwi,That made me laugh harder than it should
14-01-2019T23:15:00,Ordithus,haha
14-01-2019T23:15:02,SpazztasticKiwi,But no that’s very much not likely
14-01-2019T23:15:59,TheBeckoner,I mean hey
14-01-2019T23:16:09,TheBeckoner,maybe he also moved to california...
14-01-2019T23:16:47,SpazztasticKiwi,No he’s still local. Someone I know told me he saw him in town
14-01-2019T23:17:52,SpazztasticKiwi,"Same person asked me if o knew if he had a kid. Which if he does, yippee. But hopefully it’s not any older than 3"
14-01-2019T23:18:11,SpazztasticKiwi,But I really really really REALLY doubt it

14-01-2019T23:20:28,Ordithus,Last I knew she was finishing her medical degree in Kansas
14-01-2019T23:20:58,SpazztasticKiwi,I know plenty about mine mainly cause his family is around and tells me
14-01-2019T23:21:09,SpazztasticKiwi,As I’m sure they fill him in about me
14-01-2019T23:21:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Yet he’s not spoken or typed a word to me in the near approaching 4 years
