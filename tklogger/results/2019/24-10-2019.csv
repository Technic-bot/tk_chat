24-10-2019T21:29:02,ZRO4825,"lol, the chibis took control"
24-10-2019T21:29:09,Sclimshady,"""ill do it real quick"" famous last words"
24-10-2019T21:31:50,Mihari,"They are missleading, you think awww, their cute and small, should be quick to do and colour. but then you fill a canvas of those small things and suddenly you got the equivalent of a full sized project."
24-10-2019T21:32:15,DesertFox,"Well, I also got like, almost done with the inking before I realized I hated her shirt XD"
24-10-2019T21:32:21,ZRO4825,XD

24-10-2019T21:48:16,MrRetroRealm,I haven;t been having good times as of late
24-10-2019T21:53:14,SageSaga,my Halloween party was cancelled the other day which was sad-

24-10-2019T21:53:50,MrRetroRealm,hope things get better
24-10-2019T21:54:00,SageSaga,this morning i got an alert on my phone that they decided to do it anyways just slightly different time
24-10-2019T21:54:17,SageSaga,so I will still be able to go- but for less than an hour <_<
24-10-2019T21:54:25,AnuSekaniArt,Evening all

24-10-2019T21:54:45,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Anu
24-10-2019T21:54:51,SageSaga,no time for a costume
24-10-2019T21:54:57,DesertFox,My birthday lands on Halloween so we'll be doing a dinner rather than a party
24-10-2019T21:55:07,AnuSekaniArt,Eyo Marv!
24-10-2019T21:55:15,SageSaga,i have a friend who also has their birthday on halloween
24-10-2019T21:55:20,Sclimshady,Spooky
24-10-2019T21:55:25,DesertFox,"My niece invited me, and she's fresh out of high school, so I know she doesnt have the money for it. Im grateful"
24-10-2019T21:55:36,DarkMageDragon,Heeeyy guys!
24-10-2019T21:55:43,DesertFox,o3o/
24-10-2019T21:55:54,DarkMageDragon,Des whatchu doin?
24-10-2019T21:56:11,Mihari,"Ya know, it occurs to me, I think Ron has a nested dislike for me or something, have you noticed not a single character he has is blonde? XD"
24-10-2019T21:56:15,AnuSekaniArt,Ey Dark!
24-10-2019T21:56:18,AnuSekaniArt,Eyo Mihari!
24-10-2019T21:56:21,ZRO4825,lol
24-10-2019T21:57:03,DesertFox,It's hard to trust someone once you find out theyre a cheetah
24-10-2019T21:57:12,DarkMageDragon,Heya Sekani
24-10-2019T21:57:18,DarkMageDragon,Des....
24-10-2019T21:57:25,DarkMageDragon,Are you proud of that one?
24-10-2019T21:57:26,Mihari,Only cheetahs can make cheetah puns! >.<
24-10-2019T21:57:46,AnuSekaniArt,Oh my word Des XD
24-10-2019T21:57:47,DesertFox,I am very proud
24-10-2019T21:57:48,SageSaga,im against all puns
24-10-2019T21:57:50,happyguyone,hey desertfox has fulvus ever encountered a ghost ?
24-10-2019T21:57:59,DarkMageDragon,Dont make me call Cait
24-10-2019T21:58:02,DesertFox,Has Fulvus ever encountered a ghost...
24-10-2019T21:58:06,DesertFox,:thinking:
24-10-2019T21:58:22,DesertFox,She had that weird premonition dream about Des. Does that count?
24-10-2019T21:58:25,SageSaga,one day when i get my 3 wishes- the third wish is totally to obliterate intentional puns from the planet
24-10-2019T21:58:48,Ordithus,Not more wishes?
24-10-2019T21:58:54,SageSaga,premonition does not equal ghost
24-10-2019T21:59:03,Mihari,I'd rather just have the ability to use infinate range TK slaps upside the head whenever someone makes them.
24-10-2019T21:59:06,SageSaga,you cant wish for more wishes- everyone knows that
24-10-2019T21:59:20,DesertFox,They just dont want you to think you can.
24-10-2019T21:59:21,DarkMageDragon,Thats what genies wwant you to think
24-10-2019T21:59:29,Ordithus,"^ they're right, you know"
24-10-2019T21:59:37,SageSaga,no they arent
24-10-2019T21:59:48,SageSaga,you dont get to cheat the system without some kinda backlash
24-10-2019T22:00:07,DarkMageDragon,Genies can make things appear outta no where
24-10-2019T22:00:20,DarkMageDragon,You cant honestly expect us to believe that they cant do more wishes
24-10-2019T22:00:22,Mihari,You guys actually arguing about fictional concepts?
24-10-2019T22:00:30,DarkMageDragon,"Yes, yes we are"
24-10-2019T22:00:37,SageSaga,of course
24-10-2019T22:01:37,SageSaga,i'd also argue that a genie cant make something out of nothing
24-10-2019T22:02:42,Ordithus,They make it out of magic
24-10-2019T22:02:48,SageSaga,exactly
24-10-2019T22:02:50,Ordithus,"So, technically correct"
24-10-2019T22:02:56,DesertFox,Someone asked about Umbra plushies yesterday
24-10-2019T22:03:43,DarkMageDragon,And what did you say?
24-10-2019T22:03:54,DesertFox,Nuthin
24-10-2019T22:04:10,SageSaga,"you are supposed to say ""How dare you speak to me"""
24-10-2019T22:04:36,Nekonny,can you guys hear me at all? ^_^
24-10-2019T22:04:47,Mihari,No
24-10-2019T22:04:57,SageSaga,of course not Ron
24-10-2019T22:05:01,Tharkis,:ctharkis-ewok:
24-10-2019T22:05:07,Ordithus,Hi Tharkis
24-10-2019T22:05:07,SageSaga,you know i cant have you on audio while playing music
24-10-2019T22:05:08,DesertFox,I have you guys muted o3o Obs would echo
24-10-2019T22:05:45,Mihari,"You are nuts, Ron."
24-10-2019T22:05:45,DesertFox,is totally NOT watching Endgame on the second monitor...
24-10-2019T22:05:45,Nekonny,audio off
24-10-2019T22:06:24,Nekonny,we are on the kb voicechat des XD
24-10-2019T22:06:32,SageSaga,who is we?
24-10-2019T22:06:50,Mihari,"Tharkis, Quetazal, and him."
24-10-2019T22:06:52,DesertFox,"Neko, I dont know how to set that up >.<"
24-10-2019T22:07:04,DesertFox,"I tried, I cant do it! I cant do iiiiiiit!"
24-10-2019T22:07:12,SageSaga,. . .
24-10-2019T22:07:28,Nekonny,"set ehat up, discord?"
24-10-2019T22:07:38,Nekonny,me and tharkis
24-10-2019T22:07:41,DesertFox,"It doesnt work! I bought 3 different headsets, my computer doesnt pick them up >.<"
24-10-2019T22:07:51,SageSaga,. . .
24-10-2019T22:07:59,SageSaga,im... shocked
24-10-2019T22:08:26,SageSaga,I had no idea Des was... computer illiterate
24-10-2019T22:08:29,DesertFox,"The front port doesnt do it, and the back port is hooked to my speakers. So I 'could' talk but I wouldnt be able to hear XD"
24-10-2019T22:08:42,SageSaga,. . . that isnt how that works
24-10-2019T22:08:46,DesertFox,>:V
24-10-2019T22:08:58,DarkMageDragon,Have you tried getting a web cam that can act as a speaker?
24-10-2019T22:09:05,SageSaga,thats a silly idea
24-10-2019T22:09:09,DesertFox,"I tried my best, dad! :ptv-whiny:"
24-10-2019T22:09:18,DarkMageDragon,Works for me
24-10-2019T22:09:28,SageSaga,webcams for a mic is a huge waste
24-10-2019T22:09:38,DarkMageDragon,Why? its a two in one
24-10-2019T22:09:45,DarkMageDragon,All the audio comes out the same speaker
24-10-2019T22:10:07,SageSaga,=_=;;; do people not learn how to use computers anymore?
24-10-2019T22:10:29,DarkMageDragon,No they do
24-10-2019T22:11:07,DarkMageDragon,Its the old people who are the problem
24-10-2019T22:11:12,Ordithus,Nynas got teef
24-10-2019T22:11:17,SageSaga,if Des has a headset he can use that- if for some crazy reason his pc doesnt have a MIC IN as well as a speaker out- something is wrong
24-10-2019T22:11:48,Ordithus,Some pcs have a single jack for both - kinda like a phone
24-10-2019T22:11:53,SageSaga,so the best option then is not to buy a camera- its to buy a USB Audio device
24-10-2019T22:12:21,SageSaga,or a USB headset
24-10-2019T22:12:27,SageSaga,or a USB mic!
24-10-2019T22:12:38,Rossriders,hello
24-10-2019T22:12:42,FoxxTrotter,"Hi, Ross."
24-10-2019T22:12:48,Ordithus,"Or a usb ""hub"" thingy that has such ports"
24-10-2019T22:12:50,Mihari,They do it cause it sounds better.
24-10-2019T22:12:51,Rossriders,hey foxx.
24-10-2019T22:12:51,Ordithus,I got one for my laptop
24-10-2019T22:12:58,SageSaga,a Mic on a camera is pretty much guaranteed to be a crap mic
24-10-2019T22:13:20,DarkMageDragon,I use one and my friend can hear me just fine
24-10-2019T22:13:44,SageSaga,you can have a bad mic and it still be a functional mic
24-10-2019T22:13:49,Rossriders,how's everybody?
24-10-2019T22:14:17,AnuSekaniArt,Could be better
24-10-2019T22:14:20,AnuSekaniArt,How are you Ross?
24-10-2019T22:14:31,AnuSekaniArt,"Well, I am getting better I should say. Was quite the craptastic week lol"
24-10-2019T22:14:58,DarkMageDragon,Or you can have an okay mic and it'll be okay
24-10-2019T22:15:09,DarkMageDragon,I dont get why your making a big deal out of this?
24-10-2019T22:15:17,DarkMageDragon,I just offered Des a suggestion
24-10-2019T22:15:56,SageSaga,because going out and buying a camera is a bad suggestion for someone who already has what they need?
24-10-2019T22:17:23,DarkMageDragon,"Okay okay, so all he needs is some IT help theen right?"
24-10-2019T22:18:04,SageSaga,that or an audio usb device or a converted- both of which i think are under 10 bucks
24-10-2019T22:18:29,SageSaga,but if one of his headsets has USB then hes fine and can use that- just needs some help
24-10-2019T22:19:32,PandaNick,Yawl racing
24-10-2019T22:19:48,Rossriders,"I'm okay enough @AnuSekaniart, although recovering from surgery so, I'll be at less than 60% for a good while."
24-10-2019T22:30:48,RimaDraws,hey
24-10-2019T22:30:56,Sclimshady,Hi Rima o/

24-10-2019T22:38:20,DesertFox,"I got in my truck the other day, the cab smelled like rotten milk"
24-10-2019T22:38:26,AnuSekaniArt,Oof
24-10-2019T22:38:37,DesertFox,"Drove to the track today, the smell was gone, but my engine overheated"
24-10-2019T22:38:47,DesertFox,Think it's time I went to a mechanic...
24-10-2019T22:39:24,AnuSekaniArt,I'd say so yeah

24-10-2019T22:47:41,Mihari,Everything has just fallen in line horribly this year.
24-10-2019T22:48:00,DesertFox,"No, not yet. Im not sure what I should do. I usually draw Fulvus in something witchy :P"

24-10-2019T22:53:00,SageSaga,???
24-10-2019T22:53:18,Ordithus,Pretty sure she got more than ears
24-10-2019T22:53:25,RimaDraws,and tail
24-10-2019T22:53:43,DarkMageDragon,@DesertFox what was your idea?
24-10-2019T22:54:00,SageSaga,Sclim- the picture that was up was of Blue and Nami from Yosh
24-10-2019T22:54:10,DesertFox,My idea was Not Safe For Work XD
24-10-2019T22:54:36,RimaDraws,lol
24-10-2019T22:54:42,Sclimshady,"Shoot, I need to reread and catch up on Yosh.  I keep forgetting about it"
24-10-2019T22:55:51,RimaDraws,i need to actually read it
24-10-2019T22:56:12,Ordithus,you do

24-10-2019T22:57:22,Sclimshady,Im so far behind :oof:
24-10-2019T23:00:00,DesertFox,They pushed the Warframe update to next week... Whyyyyyyyyy >.<
24-10-2019T23:00:07,DesertFox,I want Grendel so baaaaaaaaaaad
24-10-2019T23:03:44,SageSaga,so Des- what headset do ya have?
24-10-2019T23:03:56,DesertFox,Or lord... I have no idea
24-10-2019T23:04:53,DesertFox,One's a logitech. It has an adapter for split headset and microphone.
24-10-2019T23:05:14,SageSaga,to what?
24-10-2019T23:05:27,DesertFox,The problem with my computer is it confuses mic input and headset output
24-10-2019T23:05:48,DesertFox,So I have one plugin for mic and one for the headset
24-10-2019T23:06:08,SageSaga,and your computer doesnt have a Mic and Speaker on the back?
24-10-2019T23:06:11,DesertFox,"Except last time I tried to use it, the input was so weak, it couldnt pick up my voice"
24-10-2019T23:06:37,SageSaga,do you have a USB to Audio adapter?
24-10-2019T23:06:43,DesertFox,I do not
24-10-2019T23:06:56,DesertFox,I was not aware there was such a thing
24-10-2019T23:07:45,SageSaga,https://smile.amazon.com/Sabrent-External-Adapter-Windows-AU-MMSA/dp/B00IRVQ0F8/ref=sr_1_3?crid=29EWS0QUCFRXM&keywords=usb+audio+adapter&qid=1572062816&sprefix=USB+audio%2Caps%2C139&sr=8-3
24-10-2019T23:07:49,SageSaga,you can get one cheap
24-10-2019T23:10:20,SageSaga,or if you wanna get a solid headset that is comfy- you can spend some money and get something like this -
24-10-2019T23:10:21,SageSaga,https://smile.amazon.com/HyperX-Cloud-Gaming-Headset-Line/dp/B01MTLMV89/ref=sr_1_7?crid=3GNIVZVKABU8R&keywords=hypercloud+x&qid=1572062994&sprefix=hypercl%2Caps%2C132&sr=8-7
24-10-2019T23:11:27,SageSaga,im wearing a 200 dollar pair of head phones right now- but its not as comfortable as that headset is
24-10-2019T23:12:51,AnuSekaniArt,"Des, all these Fulvus pics are freaking adorable <3 <3 And Sage I am super digging that pic! Love the vampire aesthetic and you really nailed Nyna's expression there ^^"
