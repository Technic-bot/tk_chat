04-07-2019T04:51:39,AspiringNoodle,And can confirm I did not sleep for a full day <3
04-07-2019T07:06:45,AspiringNoodle,"FINALLY got to the grocery store today.  Went at 6:30 AM for like the first time in my life.  Nobody there, shelves being stocked"
04-07-2019T07:06:54,AspiringNoodle,Fully stocked donut selection.  I was weak ;_;

04-07-2019T08:48:15,AspiringNoodle,"Sorry, just got done watching a video discussing card changes in Hearthstone xD"
04-07-2019T08:48:45,AspiringNoodle,"Some are silly, some I approve, some are blatant wokeness / Chinese compliance."
04-07-2019T08:49:04,IronHorseComics,you surprised by that?
04-07-2019T08:49:23,AspiringNoodle,So far it's only 8 cards
04-07-2019T08:49:36,AspiringNoodle,"2 of which I actually approve of, the new cards look good (it was just an art swap)"
04-07-2019T08:50:23,AspiringNoodle,"2 removed blood, Eviscerate and Bite."
04-07-2019T08:50:48,AspiringNoodle,"Eviscerate just removed the blood from the art, otherwise it's the same, so not impressed.  Bite got an entirely new picture which isn't half bad."
04-07-2019T08:51:18,AspiringNoodle,"The reason I say wokeness / Chinese compliance, though, are two cards in particular"
04-07-2019T08:51:44,AspiringNoodle,The warlock card Succubus was replaced entirely with Felstalker.
04-07-2019T08:52:02,AspiringNoodle,"And ""Mistress of Pain"" became ""Queen of Pain"" with new art"
04-07-2019T08:52:32,IronHorseComics,how is that woke or compliant with the Chinese?
04-07-2019T08:52:54,AspiringNoodle,China is cracking down on 3 things in particular
04-07-2019T08:53:01,AspiringNoodle,"Sex / romance, violence, death."
04-07-2019T08:53:39,IronHorseComics,says the country whose communist founder killed more than Hitler and Stalin combined even at his lowest estimate
04-07-2019T08:53:53,AspiringNoodle,*shrugs shoulders*
04-07-2019T08:54:13,AspiringNoodle,They swapped one authoritarian government for another
04-07-2019T08:54:47,AspiringNoodle,"The government wants complete control over what people can see / say.  Violence and sex are rather new, though"
04-07-2019T08:54:56,AspiringNoodle,Death has more or less been a big part of their culture.
04-07-2019T08:55:53,IronHorseComics,as it has been with just about everyone
04-07-2019T08:56:07,AspiringNoodle,"And I say ""death"", but what I mean are symbolic or paranormal depictions of death."
04-07-2019T08:56:30,AspiringNoodle,"Skeletons, rotting corpses, zombies, random viscera, ghosts, etc."
04-07-2019T08:57:17,AspiringNoodle,"A big joke in World of Warcraft is that when we run the Scholomance dungeon, all we're doing is killing many aspiring bakers! :ptv-laugh:"
04-07-2019T08:58:22,IronHorseComics,"I think Blizzard should tell China ""Stop stealing assets from our games and then we'll talk about your censorship"""
04-07-2019T08:58:39,AspiringNoodle,The market is doing its job pretty well :P
04-07-2019T08:59:08,AspiringNoodle,Rainbow Six Siege tried to censor their game not too long ago to appease Chinese censorship.  The changes they made for China would become global
04-07-2019T08:59:21,AspiringNoodle,But backlash was so swift and fierce that they reversed the changes for all other countries.
04-07-2019T09:00:15,AspiringNoodle,Curious as to what they changed? :3
04-07-2019T09:07:10,AspiringNoodle,*YouTube videos having a hard time buffering again*

04-07-2019T09:11:22,IronHorseComics,had a couple inconveniences but other than that it was all good
04-07-2019T09:13:19,AspiringNoodle,"I had a ""fun"" time trying to go to bed xD"
04-07-2019T09:13:40,AspiringNoodle,Basically spent 30 minutes on my phone in bed waiting for fireworks to stop.
04-07-2019T09:27:22,AspiringNoodle,*Spent last 2 - 3 weeks struggling with no sleep schedule*

04-07-2019T09:39:10,AspiringNoodle,Only downside is that I have to wait 2+ weeks for the RTX 2080 super to launch :(
04-07-2019T09:39:57,AspiringNoodle,"But seriously, this is ridiculous.  All the latest and greatest hardware launching within a single month???"

04-07-2019T17:21:05,AspiringNoodle,I hear it's very popular :ptv-snicker:
04-07-2019T17:22:36,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
04-07-2019T17:23:37,Bgrmystr2,Went to Disneyworld several times. Got the hospital bill to prove it. All but once.
04-07-2019T17:23:53,Bgrmystr2,You'll keep it because I don't want it.
04-07-2019T17:25:08,AspiringNoodle,Wait... wut...
04-07-2019T17:25:34,AspiringNoodle,"So you went several times, and also the hospital several times?"

04-07-2019T17:26:23,Bgrmystr2,Went several times yes. And all but once ended up in the hospital due to severe dehydration. Wasn't just Disney. Universal. Also the Six Flags here before Hurricane Katrina destroyed it.

04-07-2019T17:28:57,Bgrmystr2,"when Ryzen 3000 releases, they're gonna test all the non-CPU stuff on the Ryzen"
04-07-2019T17:29:00,Bgrmystr2,most likely
04-07-2019T17:29:25,AspiringNoodle,"It's ridiculous, though"
04-07-2019T17:29:37,AspiringNoodle,The rated sequential read/write speeds are 5000/4400 MB/s
04-07-2019T17:29:49,Bgrmystr2,isn't that what they already reach now?
04-07-2019T17:29:55,Bgrmystr2,how is that ridiculous lol
04-07-2019T17:29:58,AspiringNoodle,3500/3300 at best
04-07-2019T17:30:07,Bgrmystr2,not from what I've seen
04-07-2019T17:30:27,AspiringNoodle,We're talking single drive speeds
04-07-2019T17:30:37,AspiringNoodle,"If you've seen higher, then they're running in RAID"
04-07-2019T17:30:40,Bgrmystr2,yeah single drive
04-07-2019T17:30:42,Bgrmystr2,not raid
04-07-2019T17:31:19,Bgrmystr2,my friend was lookin through NVMes a few days prior
04-07-2019T17:31:20,AspiringNoodle,"And Samsungs drives are basically pushing the limits as they are, they're running up against the bandwidth restraints of gen 3"
04-07-2019T17:32:20,AspiringNoodle,An outlet was able to test a Ryzen 3600 on an X570 board
04-07-2019T17:32:42,AspiringNoodle,Barely any improvement.  So it's likely a driver issue or will come down to overclocking.
04-07-2019T17:33:56,Bgrmystr2,"Well, what I saw being sold was about what you said, prolly about mid 4000s, 4400 4600 or so. Single drive."
04-07-2019T17:37:56,TeapotOfDoom,"Can confirm, samsung controllers are the best"
04-07-2019T17:38:40,TeapotOfDoom,Also Bgr ever tried drinking beer? I heard that it can help with electrolytes
04-07-2019T17:42:29,Bgrmystr2,All I'll say is fuck you and fuck that xD
04-07-2019T17:42:35,Bgrmystr2,cuz that's just a no.
04-07-2019T17:43:06,Bgrmystr2,There's plenty of other things. Several nurses recommended Gatorade or Powerade.
04-07-2019T17:47:59,TeapotOfDoom,Well yeah i know it sounds stupid xD
04-07-2019T17:48:11,TeapotOfDoom,Did it help?
04-07-2019T17:51:05,Bgrmystr2,"Sometimes, not always"

04-07-2019T18:19:59,AspiringNoodle,It's official... US society is raising a bunch of sociopaths...
04-07-2019T18:20:49,AspiringNoodle,Lady in Texas facing up to 20 years for licking ice cream in a grocery store before putting it back on a shelf.  It was filmed. The accomplice encouraged the behavior.  Wtf is wrong with people?!?
04-07-2019T18:27:39,TeapotOfDoom,WTF 20 years?
04-07-2019T18:27:48,TeapotOfDoom,why so much?
04-07-2019T18:29:02,AspiringNoodle,2nd degree felony tampering of a consumer product
04-07-2019T18:29:09,AspiringNoodle,"2 - 20 years and up to $10,000 in fines"
04-07-2019T18:29:48,AspiringNoodle,"Think about it this way.  If they didn't know WHERE this lady was and what store was affected, the company could be forced to recall EVERYTHING from EVERYWHERE"
04-07-2019T18:29:57,AspiringNoodle,Millions of dollars in product gone
04-07-2019T18:30:31,AspiringNoodle,And this is becoming a trend on social media...
04-07-2019T18:30:53,AspiringNoodle,"Young people going into stores, tampering with products, then putting them back on shelves, all while being filmed by a friend"
04-07-2019T18:31:21,AspiringNoodle,"One person literally takes a bottle of Listerine, gets a giant mouthful, swishes, spits back into the bottle, puts cap back on and puts it back on the shelf"
04-07-2019T18:31:23,TeapotOfDoom,Now that's just stupid
04-07-2019T18:31:40,TeapotOfDoom,Ok and that's just sick
04-07-2019T18:31:49,TeapotOfDoom,wtf is wrong with people
04-07-2019T18:32:14,AspiringNoodle,Good news though
04-07-2019T18:32:29,AspiringNoodle,Investigators are in discussion with the FDA and more charges could be made
04-07-2019T18:33:04,AspiringNoodle,"Also, they were able to identify the store with the tainted carton.  And the lady is being / potentially has been identified, and a warrant WILL be made for her arrest."
04-07-2019T18:33:36,AspiringNoodle,"Remember, this is a FELONY.  That means no voting rights, no 2A rights once out of prison if convicted."
04-07-2019T18:33:53,AspiringNoodle,That's how seriously they take this shiz
04-07-2019T18:34:45,AspiringNoodle,"OH wait, did you think she licked the carton???"
04-07-2019T18:36:47,TeapotOfDoom,No i thought THEY filmed her
04-07-2019T18:36:58,TeapotOfDoom,and they knew where this incident happened
04-07-2019T18:37:30,TeapotOfDoom,So she just licked some icecream in some random location and they did NOT know where?
04-07-2019T18:37:44,TeapotOfDoom,SRSLY WTF IS WRONG WITH PEOPLE
04-07-2019T18:37:45,AspiringNoodle,"Nope, just her and a friend, filming her opening some ice cream, licking it, then putting the lid back on and the carton back in the freezer :P"
04-07-2019T18:38:01,AspiringNoodle,The listerine one is apparently staged.
04-07-2019T18:38:15,TeapotOfDoom,Ok then i can understand the harsh punishment
04-07-2019T18:38:22,AspiringNoodle,"The video I'm watching pointed out that the bottle was already open, all the surrounding bottles were still sealed"
04-07-2019T18:38:47,TeapotOfDoom,Yeah then it's like a very bad joke but still a joke
04-07-2019T18:38:48,AspiringNoodle,"Problem is, that still sets a precedent, and will encourage copycats"
04-07-2019T18:39:14,TeapotOfDoom,people are obviously dumb enough to do this kinda shit
04-07-2019T18:39:18,TeapotOfDoom,i mean really?
04-07-2019T18:39:30,AspiringNoodle,"I feel like we need to make stupidity a crime, lol"
04-07-2019T18:39:35,AspiringNoodle,Double the sentence xD
04-07-2019T18:40:14,AspiringNoodle,"And I don't mean stupidity *literally*, I mean like in this case, where the lady had a friend encourage and film her"
04-07-2019T18:40:37,AspiringNoodle,"Give her a lower-end sentence, say the minimum 2 years, then double it for the video"
04-07-2019T18:49:10,AspiringNoodle,"...just learned about a Youtube prankster in Spain who was sentenced to 15-months in prison and $22,000 in restitution to the victim of his prank"
04-07-2019T18:49:47,AspiringNoodle,Though it's likely he'll get probation instead because it was a non-violent offense and it's his first case
04-07-2019T18:57:43,TeapotOfDoom,i also really dislike the prank culture. i mean a good practical joke is ok but these people still tend to take it to the extreme
04-07-2019T18:58:04,TeapotOfDoom,even though several people already got arrested
04-07-2019T19:02:22,AspiringNoodle,"I'm not a fan of ""cringe situation"" pranks, either"
04-07-2019T19:24:58,TeapotOfDoom,I'm gonna head to bed. my routing is kinda out of whack and i think i need to rethink the board layout a bit.
04-07-2019T19:25:10,TeapotOfDoom,Night y'all

04-07-2019T21:26:12,Bgrmystr2,"there's no stream today, tomorrow, or sunday"
04-07-2019T21:26:19,Bgrmystr2,been sayin it for prolly a month now
04-07-2019T21:26:29,Bgrmystr2,so welcome to the non-stream :)
04-07-2019T21:26:35,Yevni,Prob. I just forget what relevant day it is lol
04-07-2019T21:38:44,SpazztasticKiwi,I slept
04-07-2019T21:39:10,SpazztasticKiwi,but I’ve hit that point today that everything’s hilarious
04-07-2019T21:45:50,AspiringNoodle,"I took a super long nap, but I feel like I'll be able to go to bed on time"
04-07-2019T21:46:01,AspiringNoodle,Probably because of how sleep deprived I was :P
04-07-2019T21:58:18,SpazztasticKiwi,my sleep habits are shit and despite me knowing this and needing/wanting to change it before it’s too late it’s also like
04-07-2019T21:58:26,SpazztasticKiwi,“eh you’re still young”
04-07-2019T21:59:02,SpazztasticKiwi,sometimes sleep don’t compute
