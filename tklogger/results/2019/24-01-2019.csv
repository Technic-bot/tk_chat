24-01-2019T13:55:07,ElvenHunter84,"Tom, would it be possible to put page 6 of Magical Mishaps in the color vote for this month?"
24-01-2019T14:01:07,Dadrobit,Click here to confirm: Dunno if he's still here. But earlier he confirmed a page or two ago that MM isn't something he's allowing to be Nora'd.
24-01-2019T14:01:34,Dadrobit,"""Click here to confirm:"" Picarto pls"
24-01-2019T14:02:19,Dadrobit,Or that he really realy doesn't want people to.
24-01-2019T14:02:23,Dadrobit,really*
24-01-2019T14:18:47,TorqueEmUp,I think that's because he plans to have it colored in the future anyway if he hires some help.
24-01-2019T14:20:13,TerraTheWizard,am back

24-01-2019T14:31:24,Twokinds,Yeah I'm doing that myself
24-01-2019T14:31:41,Twokinds,I plan to have this first one in color and ready to print for Anthrocon
24-01-2019T14:33:47,ElvenHunter84,Oh cool
24-01-2019T14:34:11,ElvenHunter84,"Any word on if that second side comic for this year is going to release all at once, or page by page like MM?"
24-01-2019T14:35:47,ElvenHunter84,and can we buy the print version of the comic if we don't go to Anthrocon?

24-01-2019T15:30:02,CrimsonQuill,"My picks are definitely halfkind girl, N7 Nat and How to Train your Nora."
24-01-2019T15:39:27,TorqueEmUp,"Rabbit village, Leash, and Howling Urges"
24-01-2019T15:45:09,CrimsonQuill,Howling Urges was a strong contender.
24-01-2019T16:06:25,TerraTheWizard,"i went for euchre, clovis, & rabbitses"
24-01-2019T16:06:49,CrimsonQuill,D'you think Tom'll post the concepts with Halfkind girl?
24-01-2019T16:09:50,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
24-01-2019T16:10:13,Mippy,I actually voted for Clovis...for...like the first time. :ctwokinds-clovisgirl_shake: Booby McFoxFace is just too good
24-01-2019T16:11:14,CrimsonQuill,"Cute and clean, for me. Cute and clean."
24-01-2019T16:11:23,CrimsonQuill,And Halfkind girl just looks so nice...
24-01-2019T16:11:30,CrimsonQuill,Shame the name Willow's taken.
24-01-2019T16:14:11,Mippy,This month was actually strangely clean for us :ctwokinds-floraquestion:
24-01-2019T16:16:35,CrimsonQuill,Ummm....debatable.
24-01-2019T16:19:53,Mippy,"Well, either way I’m back to Basitins next month."
24-01-2019T16:21:26,TerraTheWizard,i'll probably try my silly keith suggestion
24-01-2019T16:21:41,TerraTheWizard,"""Keith's goatbeard goes too far."""
24-01-2019T16:25:30,CrimsonQuill,"I think next week, i shall try a new crossover."
24-01-2019T16:25:42,CrimsonQuill,That's all I can think of at the moment-crossovers.
24-01-2019T16:25:55,CrimsonQuill,Probably a Star Wars or Doctor Who one.
24-01-2019T16:27:09,Mippy,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA: (secretly still wants pole dancing Alabaster) will probably go with something involving a cute baby Keith
24-01-2019T16:27:29,CrimsonQuill,It'd be fun to see Jedi vs Sith Trace...
24-01-2019T16:28:04,CrimsonQuill,"But I suppose what I really want to see is a sequel to Halo Raine, where she's training with the Chief, as RED and Cortana have a conversation."
24-01-2019T16:28:22,CrimsonQuill,"And the main reason I want THAT is to clear up that in that pic, RED isn't Cortana..."
24-01-2019T16:28:32,CrimsonQuill,"So, really something different is probably better."
24-01-2019T16:28:44,CrimsonQuill,Maybe  Archmage Kathrin...
24-01-2019T16:29:16,CrimsonQuill,Or what if Maren knew magic?
24-01-2019T16:29:28,TerraTheWizard,lol mippy
24-01-2019T16:29:44,CrimsonQuill,Maybe a scene showing just HOW Red flunked as a Templar...
24-01-2019T16:29:49,CrimsonQuill,That'd be rather fun.
24-01-2019T16:31:43,Mippy,My mom texted me to say she got my “sour rot”:ctwokinds-keifacepalm:

24-01-2019T16:33:06,Mippy,She means sauerkraut :ctwokinds-keifacepalm:
24-01-2019T16:33:27,CrimsonQuill,Isn't that the stuff served with sausages?
24-01-2019T16:33:42,CrimsonQuill,"Y'know, onions, cabbage, that sort of thing?"
24-01-2019T16:34:00,Mippy,"Yup, I’m having sausage tonight. Gotta have it with mustard and sauerkraut"
24-01-2019T16:34:20,CrimsonQuill,Hmmm...tasty.
24-01-2019T16:34:30,CrimsonQuill,We had roast beef and potatoes...
24-01-2019T16:34:38,CrimsonQuill,With cabbage and gravy!
24-01-2019T16:35:03,CrimsonQuill,And my mother was around. She made a huge pile of flapjacks.

24-01-2019T17:26:12,Bgrmystr2,you guys and your color votes
24-01-2019T17:26:23,CrimsonQuill,Yah.
24-01-2019T17:26:35,ThingsAreMoving,"Someone's gotta do it, Bgr"
24-01-2019T17:26:41,Bgrmystr2,"true, things"
24-01-2019T17:26:56,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-sleepy: so tired this mornin
24-01-2019T17:27:17,ThingsAreMoving,weren't you tired yesterday morning too?
24-01-2019T17:27:26,Bgrmystr2,yeah I don't do mornings.
24-01-2019T17:27:49,Bgrmystr2,usually takes me an hr to wake up to actually be ready to do anything properly
24-01-2019T17:28:05,ThingsAreMoving,but you've shown up an hour later than usual. How are you still tired
24-01-2019T17:28:16,ThingsAreMoving,stop working out when you sleep already
24-01-2019T17:28:30,Bgrmystr2,because I literally just woke up like 10 mins ago. I went to sleep early at like 5:30am too.
24-01-2019T17:28:40,Bgrmystr2,so I just was super tired last night
24-01-2019T17:28:55,CrimsonQuill,"For me, Waking up is easy."
24-01-2019T17:29:04,CrimsonQuill,It's GETTING up that's the difficult part.
24-01-2019T17:29:07,Bgrmystr2,11+ hrs of sleep last night
24-01-2019T17:29:16,ThingsAreMoving,"that's too much, srsly"
24-01-2019T17:29:24,Bgrmystr2,lool
24-01-2019T17:29:34,Bgrmystr2,my body said otherwise
24-01-2019T17:30:53,Bgrmystr2,feels like when you haven't slept for like 20 hrs or something.. and then you finally go to sleep and you sleep for like 15 hrs cuz your body has to catch up all that info
24-01-2019T17:31:47,CrimsonQuill,True that.
24-01-2019T17:31:52,ThingsAreMoving,the only time I've slept 15hrs is after working 12hr shifts 9 days in a row
24-01-2019T17:32:12,CrimsonQuill,On occasions I stay up all night (Like an idiot) I am absolutely wrecked the next day.
24-01-2019T17:32:18,CrimsonQuill,And need LOTS of sleep.
24-01-2019T17:32:26,CrimsonQuill,But thankfully that's rare.
24-01-2019T17:32:52,Bgrmystr2,I should be fine for tonight though
24-01-2019T17:32:55,ThingsAreMoving,"I usually go to bed around 2am, but if need be I can wake up at 6am and work through the whole day like normal"
24-01-2019T17:33:08,Bgrmystr2,I can't do that
24-01-2019T17:33:37,Bgrmystr2,"you wouldn't wake me up till like 10 if you're lucky, things"
24-01-2019T17:33:40,ThingsAreMoving,I'm pretty experienced in handling sleep deprivation
24-01-2019T17:33:42,CrimsonQuill,I try to go to bed before midnight to wake up at 6/7am.
24-01-2019T17:33:44,Bgrmystr2,if I went to sleep at 2am
24-01-2019T17:33:57,Bgrmystr2,My body just doesn't do it.
24-01-2019T17:34:05,Bgrmystr2,it ignores everything and keeps sleeping.
24-01-2019T17:34:18,ThingsAreMoving,"I did say ' if need be '. I normally wake up at 10, after 8 hrs of sleep."
24-01-2019T17:34:29,Bgrmystr2,xD
24-01-2019T17:34:39,Bgrmystr2,I've gotten like 4 and 6 hours of sleep before
24-01-2019T17:34:53,CrimsonQuill,"Talking of sleep, I need to go."
24-01-2019T17:34:55,Bgrmystr2,"so it's not like I can't do it, it just takes a batshit amount of effort"
24-01-2019T17:34:55,CrimsonQuill,Goodnight!
24-01-2019T17:34:59,ThingsAreMoving,"but if I had to catch an airplane or sort out some stuff at the council office early in the morning, I'd wake up."

24-01-2019T17:35:44,ThingsAreMoving,I know right
24-01-2019T17:35:59,ThingsAreMoving,some people can't have it easy and be born in the US
24-01-2019T17:36:16,ThingsAreMoving,some people have to struggle
24-01-2019T17:36:24,Bgrmystr2,I wonder if quill still things tom's cat is a hamster
24-01-2019T17:36:31,Bgrmystr2,..thinks*
24-01-2019T17:36:34,Bgrmystr2,fucking damnit
24-01-2019T17:36:39,Bgrmystr2,you've ruined me]
24-01-2019T17:36:47,ThingsAreMoving,I think he got that one sorted out.
24-01-2019T17:37:01,Bgrmystr2,"did he? Cuz when the chat happened, he didn't lol"
24-01-2019T17:37:08,ThingsAreMoving,:ptv-condescending: a pleasure to be ruining you
24-01-2019T17:37:18,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-pouty: yeah yeah
24-01-2019T17:37:52,Bgrmystr2,I am guessing you will be leaving before the streams too
24-01-2019T17:38:06,ThingsAreMoving,"probably, maybbe"
24-01-2019T17:38:39,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-unimpressed: such a quitter
24-01-2019T17:38:40,ThingsAreMoving,"dunno. I have some drugs that I could use to get the boost, but I don't think I want to"
24-01-2019T17:38:54,Bgrmystr2,you gonna be a quitter like Quill?
24-01-2019T17:39:24,ThingsAreMoving,are you trying to convince me to do drugs to attend friday stream?
24-01-2019T17:40:20,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-confused: w-what? Nooooo what? Why would I do that?
24-01-2019T17:40:48,ThingsAreMoving,Cause you like when I'm here.
24-01-2019T17:41:04,ThingsAreMoving,y'know. another 30+ that you can talk to?
24-01-2019T17:41:10,ThingsAreMoving,:ptv-snicker:
24-01-2019T17:41:13,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-nope: I would definitely in no way at all whatsoever not condone drugs so you can enjoy the friday stream with us and talk with us and do stuff you don't usually do with us.
24-01-2019T17:41:42,ThingsAreMoving,my reverse psychology sense is tingling
24-01-2019T17:42:09,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock:
24-01-2019T17:43:02,Bgrmystr2,"it is still up to you though, I dunno what you have to do tomorrow or whatever :ptv-wondering:"
24-01-2019T17:43:29,ThingsAreMoving,"I have my new PC tower coming in, gonna do some electronic transplanting"
24-01-2019T17:44:11,ThingsAreMoving,aside from that I have to speak with my housemates if they're staying if I move out
24-01-2019T17:44:25,ThingsAreMoving,nothing else on the agenda
24-01-2019T17:44:37,Bgrmystr2,so... nothing particularly important like college classes or work
24-01-2019T17:44:38,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-nibsbounce:
24-01-2019T17:44:41,Bgrmystr2,hey terra
24-01-2019T17:44:44,TerraTheWizard,hey
24-01-2019T17:44:46,ThingsAreMoving,I don't work on weekends
24-01-2019T17:44:48,ThingsAreMoving,o/ Terra
24-01-2019T17:44:51,Bgrmystr2,thennnnnn
24-01-2019T17:44:59,TerraTheWizard,"been busy making emotes, didn't notice people talking here"
24-01-2019T17:45:04,Bgrmystr2,why you never show up
24-01-2019T17:45:11,Bgrmystr2,well wb terra
24-01-2019T17:45:22,ThingsAreMoving,cause the stream starts at 2am my local time
24-01-2019T17:45:30,ThingsAreMoving,and I work 13 - 21:15
24-01-2019T17:45:40,TerraTheWizard,seeing as there are actualy people here now
24-01-2019T17:45:43,TerraTheWizard,i did an art today https://www.deviantart.com/terrathewizard/art/Sythe-vs-Nibs-782686760
24-01-2019T17:45:56,Bgrmystr2,I saw that earlier ^
24-01-2019T17:46:00,ThingsAreMoving,so I have a full working day behind me and 5+ hrs of waiting for the stream
24-01-2019T17:46:15,ThingsAreMoving,"you, I've seen it too."
24-01-2019T17:46:30,Bgrmystr2,"maybe, things, you could flip your time"
24-01-2019T17:47:09,ThingsAreMoving,"neat, are you sketching it before doing the linework, Terra?"
24-01-2019T17:47:17,Bgrmystr2,"sleep after coming home, then be awake afterwards"
24-01-2019T17:47:32,TerraTheWizard,i kinda did for this one
24-01-2019T17:47:36,TerraTheWizard,"well, nibs anyway"
24-01-2019T17:47:52,TerraTheWizard,all the sketch for sythe was a circle so i could make his head the right size
24-01-2019T17:47:53,ThingsAreMoving,I... don't think I could bgr.
24-01-2019T17:47:57,TerraTheWizard,lol
24-01-2019T17:48:16,ThingsAreMoving,that would require me to change my whole sleeping pattern and would cause me to miss sunday streams
24-01-2019T17:48:29,Bgrmystr2,"I've suggested it to people before, some ppl that sit in front of their computer and go to sleep anyway.. and then they question the logic when in reality they're just doing the same thing I suggested but in their computer chair."
24-01-2019T17:48:43,Bgrmystr2,"hmm, I guess sunday streams happen when you come home, don't they?"
24-01-2019T17:49:18,ThingsAreMoving,sunday streams start on 21:00 local time on sunday
24-01-2019T17:49:27,TerraTheWizard,here's the sketch layer https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/527610623870369793/538490545757093897/unknown.png
24-01-2019T17:49:31,ThingsAreMoving,so I sit all the way to 2 am monday
24-01-2019T17:49:53,ThingsAreMoving,that's usually enough to see 90%+ of the stream
24-01-2019T17:50:23,Bgrmystr2,hm :thinking:
24-01-2019T17:50:49,Bgrmystr2,and sunday streams have the votes
24-01-2019T17:50:56,Bgrmystr2,so I can see why they'd be a bit more important
24-01-2019T17:51:10,Bgrmystr2,can't vote if you're ded in bed
24-01-2019T17:51:15,ThingsAreMoving,yup
24-01-2019T17:51:34,ThingsAreMoving,besides they match my work/sleep hours almost perfectly
24-01-2019T17:51:37,Bgrmystr2,"still, you're workless tomorrow"
24-01-2019T17:51:47,Bgrmystr2,so I mean..
24-01-2019T17:51:51,Bgrmystr2,:U
24-01-2019T17:52:07,ThingsAreMoving,"Alright, once in a while."
24-01-2019T17:52:13,Bgrmystr2,xD
24-01-2019T17:52:17,ThingsAreMoving,cocaine or amphetamine ?
24-01-2019T17:52:24,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock:
24-01-2019T17:52:57,Bgrmystr2,I would definitely say neither.
24-01-2019T17:53:04,Bgrmystr2,Cuz nooo
24-01-2019T17:53:23,ThingsAreMoving,well I won't be able to stay awake otherwise
24-01-2019T17:53:27,Bgrmystr2,"Also, Terra it looks like Nibbly has a claw hand"
24-01-2019T17:53:50,Bgrmystr2,Nibbly.. the true face behind Dr Claw
24-01-2019T17:54:09,ThingsAreMoving,"And I did say that me staying here involved doing drugs, so If you want me here you need to decide, bgr. :ptv-SteelwormHades:"
24-01-2019T17:54:17,Bgrmystr2,wat
24-01-2019T17:54:32,TerraTheWizard,lol
24-01-2019T17:54:37,Bgrmystr2,well you have zero % chance of me believing you has cocaine for any reason.
24-01-2019T17:54:39,TerraTheWizard,"yeah, that ""claw hand"" is a bishop"
24-01-2019T17:54:49,Bgrmystr2,"yeah I can tell terra, just at first glance I mean"
24-01-2019T17:54:53,TerraTheWizard,:P
24-01-2019T17:55:06,ThingsAreMoving,"I don't need your belief, I need you to make the choice, lol"
24-01-2019T17:55:29,ThingsAreMoving,"I have both, I know what dosage I need to take for an extra 3-4hrs"
24-01-2019T17:55:35,Bgrmystr2,I choose your face :ptv-pouty: /vibratingflora
24-01-2019T17:56:00,Bgrmystr2,cocaine is not gonna help you stay up anyway
24-01-2019T17:56:07,ThingsAreMoving,I beg to differ
24-01-2019T17:56:23,Bgrmystr2,you're nutso :U
24-01-2019T17:56:46,ThingsAreMoving,I like to experiment. Money allows me to do just that
24-01-2019T17:56:56,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-keith8D:
24-01-2019T17:57:50,ThingsAreMoving,Besides I know my limits and recognize the dangers of this stuff.
24-01-2019T17:58:19,ThingsAreMoving,That's why I use it veeeery rarely.
24-01-2019T17:59:02,ThingsAreMoving,I'm sorry. Is that topic too sensitive for you guys?
24-01-2019T17:59:13,Bgrmystr2,no :u
24-01-2019T17:59:21,Bgrmystr2,it just makes me more worried about your health than I was before
24-01-2019T17:59:23,Bgrmystr2,which was not a lot
24-01-2019T17:59:31,Bgrmystr2,>:c
24-01-2019T17:59:43,Bgrmystr2,now it's more than that.
24-01-2019T18:00:45,Bgrmystr2,you guys don't have that.. oh what was it called
24-01-2019T18:00:54,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-reniderp:
24-01-2019T18:01:15,ThingsAreMoving,"you don't have to worry, like I said. I use it very rarely and in tiny doses. 1g of this stuff (dude that I got it from uses that in one night) lasts me for about 9 months."
24-01-2019T18:01:38,Bgrmystr2,http://5hourenergyintl.com/ this thing
24-01-2019T18:01:48,Bgrmystr2,you don't have those? :o
24-01-2019T18:02:47,ThingsAreMoving,"gotta adult, can't afford to turn into a junkie and live on the streets"
24-01-2019T18:03:00,ThingsAreMoving,those are just condensed energy drinks
24-01-2019T18:03:24,ThingsAreMoving,with lots of B12 vitamin
24-01-2019T18:03:28,Bgrmystr2,they work tho
24-01-2019T18:03:36,ThingsAreMoving,I bet they do.
24-01-2019T18:03:44,ThingsAreMoving,Like coffee
24-01-2019T18:03:51,ThingsAreMoving,with vitamin complex
24-01-2019T18:04:15,Bgrmystr2,xD
24-01-2019T18:05:13,ThingsAreMoving,"I could drink some coffee, but that gets my heart racing and there's no way to get a precise dosage that'll allow me to go to sleep when I want to"
24-01-2019T18:06:40,Bgrmystr2,"wellllllll I'm gonna go on a limb and say I'd support your being here on friday, but I'm not supporting your intake of drugs that damage your health. :u"
24-01-2019T18:06:51,Bgrmystr2,"stream is worth, VERY worth, but... it's not *that* worth."
24-01-2019T18:09:05,ThingsAreMoving,"your concern is appreciated, but like I've said, those don't have adverse effects if you know how to use them. If I'll be attending today's stream you'll know what decision has been made."
24-01-2019T18:12:28,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-uneasy:
24-01-2019T18:12:50,Bgrmystr2,well you have picked the wrong person to make that decision cuz  yeah nope
24-01-2019T18:13:14,Bgrmystr2,I'd stay up through SHEER FORCE OF WILL :ptv-pouty:
24-01-2019T18:14:31,ThingsAreMoving,":ctwokinds-maddiessparkles: (things during the stream, possibly)"
24-01-2019T18:20:40,Xexanoth,just get Insomnia and you won't have to bother with sleep
24-01-2019T18:21:16,ThingsAreMoving,Now that sounds like something that would damage my health.
24-01-2019T18:21:20,ThingsAreMoving,o/ Xex
24-01-2019T18:22:33,Xexanoth,nah why would it damage your health :ptv-confused:
24-01-2019T18:22:59,Xexanoth,health issues are totally unrelated to lack of sleep....pretty sure someone said that
24-01-2019T18:23:02,Bgrmystr2,you say that as if anything else you're wiling to do won't damage your health
24-01-2019T18:23:14,Bgrmystr2,and lack of slepe can give you health issues
24-01-2019T18:23:24,Bgrmystr2,it is a mental thing
24-01-2019T18:24:02,Bgrmystr2,Also.. xD that glitter-eyed maddie. The implications of that doesn't make me any happier
24-01-2019T18:24:09,ThingsAreMoving,I keep my health at nominal levels. I need to be healthy to work. No work equals no monies. And no monies equals to sleeping on the streets with no comfy twokinds streams.
24-01-2019T18:24:22,ThingsAreMoving,"I knew you'd get it, lol."
24-01-2019T18:24:38,Bgrmystr2,I do totally understand the reference though
24-01-2019T18:25:12,ThingsAreMoving,spoiler alert: eyes don't glitter like that after using.
24-01-2019T18:25:21,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock::ptv-sad:
24-01-2019T18:25:31,ThingsAreMoving,only your pupils dilate slightly
24-01-2019T18:25:33,Bgrmystr2,in your head they do maybe? :/
24-01-2019T18:26:36,ThingsAreMoving,well now that I think of it... I had a... friend? acquaintance?
24-01-2019T18:27:07,ThingsAreMoving,he had eyes like that when he went too hard too fast on the stuff
24-01-2019T18:28:11,ThingsAreMoving,one of the reasons I don't overdo it. I've seen people destroying their lives because drugs were an easy escape
24-01-2019T18:28:18,Bgrmystr2,lol the signs you've gone wayyy to far to look do look more like.
24-01-2019T18:28:26,Bgrmystr2,Sparkly eyes.
24-01-2019T18:28:38,ThingsAreMoving,"basically, yep"
24-01-2019T18:29:45,ThingsAreMoving,"2,5 hrs to go"
24-01-2019T18:30:04,Bgrmystr2,yknow what'd be a thing
24-01-2019T18:30:26,ThingsAreMoving,do tell
24-01-2019T18:30:27,Bgrmystr2,"if you did that and then tom's all 'no stream today, got somethin else to do' and instead decided to stream on sat"
24-01-2019T18:30:37,Bgrmystr2,the amount of RIP
24-01-2019T18:30:45,ThingsAreMoving,sounds like a productive night then
24-01-2019T18:31:08,ThingsAreMoving,"cleaning the room, getting the PC ready for transplant"
24-01-2019T18:31:31,ThingsAreMoving,"correcting my CV, looking up more job offers"
24-01-2019T18:31:51,ThingsAreMoving,"the chores are endless, such is the way of adulting"
24-01-2019T18:33:15,Bgrmystr2,lool
24-01-2019T18:33:27,Bgrmystr2,do stuff that you would have done tomorrow tonight eh
24-01-2019T18:33:48,ThingsAreMoving,more like wouldn't have done it unless I reaaaly had to
24-01-2019T18:33:58,ThingsAreMoving,xD
24-01-2019T18:34:08,Bgrmystr2,so what exactly do you mean by pc transplant
24-01-2019T18:34:19,Bgrmystr2,it's not a hospital procedure or anything..
24-01-2019T18:34:22,ThingsAreMoving,https://www.bequiet.com/en/case/1203
24-01-2019T18:34:28,Bgrmystr2,or is it? :thinking:
24-01-2019T18:34:30,ThingsAreMoving,I'm getting that beauty tomorrow
24-01-2019T18:35:01,ThingsAreMoving,Gotta take everything out from my current case and put it in the new one
24-01-2019T18:35:06,Bgrmystr2,ah so you're moving your system into that case
24-01-2019T18:35:10,Bgrmystr2,what case are you currently using?
24-01-2019T18:36:46,ThingsAreMoving,http://www.zalman.com/contents/products/view.html?no=334
24-01-2019T18:36:48,ThingsAreMoving,this one
24-01-2019T18:37:24,Bgrmystr2,ohdamn I like that case
24-01-2019T18:37:34,ThingsAreMoving,"which one, lol"
24-01-2019T18:38:15,Bgrmystr2,your current one
24-01-2019T18:38:19,Bgrmystr2,why the need to switch?
24-01-2019T18:40:19,ThingsAreMoving,"the racking for the HDD\s and the optical drives leave virtually no space for the graphics card, RAM and cable management"
24-01-2019T18:40:32,ThingsAreMoving,that be quiet! one is a dual chamber build
24-01-2019T18:40:44,Bgrmystr2,ah
24-01-2019T18:41:01,ThingsAreMoving,one side is dedicated for the mobo and the other is housing the drives
24-01-2019T18:41:05,Bgrmystr2,"the visuals of your current case makes it look real nice on the outside, but I guess it's not all up to snuff huh.."
24-01-2019T18:41:18,ThingsAreMoving,"not a lot of space on the inside, no"
24-01-2019T18:41:33,ThingsAreMoving,visually it's great
24-01-2019T18:43:05,ThingsAreMoving,Also since I've bought a prebuilt PC I didn't get the accessories for tool-less HDD mounting
24-01-2019T18:43:20,Bgrmystr2,"I'm using a case from NZXT but I always fucking forget the name of it and when I look it up, I get zero results so brb I'm gonna have to search for it again"
24-01-2019T18:45:28,Bgrmystr2,I'm running this https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811146058
24-01-2019T18:45:35,Bgrmystr2,NZXT's M59
24-01-2019T18:46:22,Bgrmystr2,it's a very pretty case
24-01-2019T18:46:35,Bgrmystr2,room for the full-size graphics cards too
24-01-2019T18:46:39,Bgrmystr2,so no big deal
24-01-2019T18:47:27,ThingsAreMoving,Lots of fans and vents on that one
24-01-2019T18:47:39,Bgrmystr2,yup
24-01-2019T18:47:45,Bgrmystr2,I basically never have to dust it out
24-01-2019T18:47:49,ThingsAreMoving,temperature control must be a breeze
24-01-2019T18:48:00,ThingsAreMoving,lol
24-01-2019T18:48:05,Bgrmystr2,"running a bunch of 120s, not even 140s"
24-01-2019T18:48:26,Bgrmystr2,"and other than some light dust collecting on a few parts, there's basically none in the cpu heatsink"
24-01-2019T18:48:40,Bgrmystr2,and none that I can tell from the gpu heatsink either
24-01-2019T18:49:01,Bgrmystr2,the front panel dies too damn quick though
24-01-2019T18:49:20,Bgrmystr2,the one thing I don't like about it. the front panel is trash.
24-01-2019T18:49:32,Bgrmystr2,I've had two cases and the front panel on both cases have fried hard drives.
24-01-2019T18:49:37,Bgrmystr2,..flash drives*
24-01-2019T18:49:40,Bgrmystr2,not hard drives
24-01-2019T18:49:42,Bgrmystr2,>.>
24-01-2019T18:49:44,ThingsAreMoving,wut
24-01-2019T18:49:46,ThingsAreMoving,how even
24-01-2019T18:49:57,Bgrmystr2,the connection is bad
24-01-2019T18:50:14,Bgrmystr2,so whoever made the front panel for that case for NZXT cut corners
24-01-2019T18:50:19,Bgrmystr2,and the power connection failed
24-01-2019T18:50:25,ThingsAreMoving,damn
24-01-2019T18:50:30,Bgrmystr2,I have three flash drives sitting dead.
24-01-2019T18:50:36,Bgrmystr2,"Two from one case, one from the other."
24-01-2019T18:51:07,ThingsAreMoving,I have a usb sound card connected to my front (top) panel
24-01-2019T18:51:20,ThingsAreMoving,"I never had any problems with it, fortunately"
24-01-2019T18:51:40,Bgrmystr2,the panel itself is not built into the case unfortunately
24-01-2019T18:51:52,Bgrmystr2,it's just sitting behind the front panel
24-01-2019T18:52:09,Bgrmystr2,"the usb connections are all loose, they wiggle a lot"
24-01-2019T18:52:17,Bgrmystr2,so I think the soldering was halfassed
24-01-2019T18:54:19,ThingsAreMoving,Good thing cases are the cheapest things when it comes to PC parts
24-01-2019T18:55:11,Xexanoth,"eh, still a good chunk of money if you want a decent one..."
24-01-2019T18:55:46,ThingsAreMoving,my new case cost me £167 tax included
24-01-2019T18:55:59,Bgrmystr2,my case only cost me bout $70
24-01-2019T18:56:15,Bgrmystr2,which is what I'd expect to pay for a case
24-01-2019T18:56:25,Bgrmystr2,between $50 to $150
24-01-2019T18:56:52,ThingsAreMoving,Isn't pc stuff less expensive in the us than in Europe?
24-01-2019T18:56:57,Bgrmystr2,not sure?
24-01-2019T18:58:42,ThingsAreMoving,"yeah, newegg sells the same case for 179,90$ which is ~£136,5"
24-01-2019T18:59:17,Bgrmystr2,oh god damn
24-01-2019T18:59:44,ThingsAreMoving,not sure if the price on newegg is including tax or not
24-01-2019T18:59:47,ThingsAreMoving,but still
24-01-2019T18:59:51,Bgrmystr2,naw it doesn't include tax
24-01-2019T18:59:53,Bgrmystr2,which is stupid
24-01-2019T19:00:07,Bgrmystr2,they've just now started adding tax to online purchases
24-01-2019T19:00:14,Bgrmystr2,for states we don't live in
24-01-2019T19:01:25,ThingsAreMoving,that sentence is weird
24-01-2019T19:02:15,Bgrmystr2,"Basically.. I live in Louisiana, and if I purchase something that's being stored in a different state, like California, I have to pay Taxes on it."
24-01-2019T19:02:49,Bgrmystr2,Even though I do not live in California and am not legally obligated to pay california tax on something I purchase. As they have no proof of my residence there.
24-01-2019T19:03:09,ThingsAreMoving,That is confusing
24-01-2019T19:03:43,ThingsAreMoving,but I guess money grabbing is easier done when customers are confused
24-01-2019T19:03:47,Bgrmystr2,"Yeah it's kinda like.. if you lived in Germany.. and if you bought tea from Britain, you'd have to pay taxes to Britain for tea you just bought."
24-01-2019T19:04:44,ThingsAreMoving,while ignoring the fact that Germany still pays import taxes when buying the tea for it's distribution centers?
24-01-2019T19:04:52,Bgrmystr2,yah basically.
24-01-2019T19:05:05,Bgrmystr2,but it's on a state level for us
24-01-2019T19:05:16,Bgrmystr2,"all the states have their own taxes, like the countries of Europe"
24-01-2019T19:05:16,ThingsAreMoving,"well, it doesn't because Shengen zone and whatnot"
24-01-2019T19:05:27,ThingsAreMoving,but I get it. it;s load of bs
24-01-2019T19:05:51,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, I can understand their wanting everyone to pay taxes on online purchases"
24-01-2019T19:06:30,Bgrmystr2,but it's about their lack of being able to enforce it and using a loophole in the law to pass tax collection stuff
24-01-2019T19:06:38,ThingsAreMoving,Logic would dictate that they'd have a distribution center in every state just to not confuse their customers
24-01-2019T19:06:49,Bgrmystr2,yeah that's how it was originally
24-01-2019T19:06:58,Bgrmystr2,"if you had a distribution center in your state, you had to pay taxes"
24-01-2019T19:07:03,Bgrmystr2,cuz it's coming from your own state
24-01-2019T19:07:13,ThingsAreMoving,wow
24-01-2019T19:07:31,ThingsAreMoving,"taxes are bs, essentially"
24-01-2019T19:07:58,Bgrmystr2,"but if there was no distribution center in your state, then you didn't have to pay taxes to that other state due to, you know, literally not living in that state"
24-01-2019T19:08:27,Bgrmystr2,but... yeah loophole removes all that
24-01-2019T19:08:38,Bgrmystr2,so we have to pay taxes on stuff purchased on Amazon and Newegg
24-01-2019T19:08:52,Bgrmystr2,but the marketplace sellers don't all have tax attached
24-01-2019T19:08:56,Bgrmystr2,like on amazon
24-01-2019T19:09:21,Bgrmystr2,I got my webcam from a marketplace seller that didn't attach tax to the purchase when amazon would have.
24-01-2019T19:09:38,Bgrmystr2,because they're just a smaller business
24-01-2019T19:10:19,Bgrmystr2,"so if anything, the tax thing means little difference in buying stuff online vs buying stuff in a store"
24-01-2019T19:10:24,ThingsAreMoving,"wait, so they didn't attach a tax to the purchase?"
24-01-2019T19:10:31,Bgrmystr2,correct
24-01-2019T19:10:49,Bgrmystr2,cuz the marketplace sellers are not big companies like amazon
24-01-2019T19:11:00,ThingsAreMoving,that would mean tax fraud on their part?
24-01-2019T19:11:06,Bgrmystr2,well not technically
24-01-2019T19:11:10,ThingsAreMoving,or is there some sort of allowance?
24-01-2019T19:11:18,Bgrmystr2,it's only forcing the super big companies to do taxes
24-01-2019T19:11:33,ThingsAreMoving,"lol, it's the other way around in my country"
24-01-2019T19:11:36,Bgrmystr2,"while not forcing the small ones to do so as that's too much work and would basically put them out of business,"
24-01-2019T19:11:49,ThingsAreMoving,the little businesses have to pay every tax they're obligated to
24-01-2019T19:12:25,ThingsAreMoving,even if you sold something and the buyer decides to pay you at a later date you still have to pay the tax from that transaction immediately
24-01-2019T19:12:44,Bgrmystr2,"lolo, if little businesses here had to pay taxes for everything they sold, they'd have to figure out tax percents for probably thousands of counties and such all over the country"
24-01-2019T19:13:04,ThingsAreMoving,"that's what businesses in my country have to do, lol"
24-01-2019T19:13:25,Bgrmystr2,yeah that's crazy. The paperwork for that would put so many businesses into the red here
24-01-2019T19:13:29,ThingsAreMoving,otherwise taxman sends out controllers and auditors and they freeze a company
24-01-2019T19:13:50,ThingsAreMoving,and that usually means the end of it
24-01-2019T19:13:54,Bgrmystr2,haha like it didn't already freeze the company already when they had to figure out all the tax stuff anyway
24-01-2019T19:14:11,Bgrmystr2,but you likely won't have nearly the amount of tax work that a company here would
24-01-2019T19:14:27,Bgrmystr2,there's probably a good 50+ counties per state.. times 50 states..
24-01-2019T19:14:37,Bgrmystr2,"some states have less, some have more"
24-01-2019T19:15:10,Bgrmystr2,but yeah.. even a lowball of 1000 different counties would be killer.
24-01-2019T19:15:18,ThingsAreMoving,yup
24-01-2019T19:15:47,ThingsAreMoving,I mean... unified tax rates would be helpful in the US
24-01-2019T19:15:50,ThingsAreMoving,imho
24-01-2019T19:16:03,Bgrmystr2,"we have........ 3,142"
24-01-2019T19:16:08,Bgrmystr2,looked it up
24-01-2019T19:16:13,Bgrmystr2,and they're not all the same.
24-01-2019T19:16:18,ThingsAreMoving,damn
24-01-2019T19:16:30,Bgrmystr2,so you'd have to figure out each one.
24-01-2019T19:16:46,Bgrmystr2,yeah.. reasons why taxes for online purchases are a nightmare
24-01-2019T19:17:09,ThingsAreMoving,that's a loooot of bureaucracy
24-01-2019T19:17:14,ThingsAreMoving,brb
24-01-2019T19:17:21,Bgrmystr2,if taxes were the same across the board for the whole country.. and they included it in the price..
24-01-2019T19:17:26,Bgrmystr2,we wouldn't have this issue
24-01-2019T19:17:39,Bgrmystr2,:/
24-01-2019T19:19:43,ThingsAreMoving,"but I guess someone couldn't benefit from that, so you'll pay california taxes while living in louisiana"
24-01-2019T19:19:56,ThingsAreMoving,"makes 100% sense, yup."
24-01-2019T19:21:14,Bgrmystr2,:C
24-01-2019T19:21:31,Bgrmystr2,all this tax shit screams someone lining their pockets
24-01-2019T19:22:38,ThingsAreMoving,seems like the world is rushing towards corpocracy
24-01-2019T19:23:06,ThingsAreMoving,not a fun vision for the future
24-01-2019T19:24:49,Bgrmystr2,ikr
24-01-2019T19:25:28,ThingsAreMoving,"I guess states in the US can be viewed as sort of separate country-like entities, yeah?"
24-01-2019T19:25:42,Bgrmystr2,yes actually
24-01-2019T19:25:56,Bgrmystr2,states are nigh equivilant to countries
24-01-2019T19:26:10,Bgrmystr2,they just answer to the federal government
24-01-2019T19:26:10,ThingsAreMoving,How many have you visited so far?
24-01-2019T19:26:33,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: hmm
24-01-2019T19:26:38,Bgrmystr2,well
24-01-2019T19:26:59,Bgrmystr2,I've not visited any states to visit them for sightseeing.. but
24-01-2019T19:27:31,ThingsAreMoving,"travelling through can count as a visit, just to keep it simple"
24-01-2019T19:29:02,Bgrmystr2,"I was born just outside of SanFran in 88, moved after the quake of 09, lived in GA for half my life, I've gone to Universal and Disney in Florida, I've gone to Massachusetts and New Hampshire to visit family."
24-01-2019T19:29:12,Bgrmystr2,quake of 89* I mean
24-01-2019T19:29:18,Bgrmystr2,not 09 xD
24-01-2019T19:29:56,ThingsAreMoving,I wouldn't even question it if you told me there was a huge quake in '09
24-01-2019T19:30:07,Bgrmystr2,I've also gone to Fernandina Beach in FL and Okefenokee in GA
24-01-2019T19:30:33,Bgrmystr2,the quake of 89 was a big deal because that was the year a double-decker bridge collapsed near SanFran
24-01-2019T19:30:38,Bgrmystr2,and a lot of people died I think
24-01-2019T19:30:54,ThingsAreMoving,GA is Georgia?
24-01-2019T19:30:57,Bgrmystr2,yeah
24-01-2019T19:31:16,Bgrmystr2,"My dad was stationed at Kings Bay, so"
24-01-2019T19:31:18,Bgrmystr2,:U
24-01-2019T19:32:08,ThingsAreMoving,"Daaaaamn, moving from the west side to the east."
24-01-2019T19:32:29,ThingsAreMoving,I was about to ask if you're a military child or something like that
24-01-2019T19:32:35,Bgrmystr2,actually yes
24-01-2019T19:32:38,Bgrmystr2,My dad was in the navy
24-01-2019T19:32:48,Bgrmystr2,stationed on an aircraft carrier
24-01-2019T19:33:11,ThingsAreMoving,Sounds like a relatively safe line of work
24-01-2019T19:33:20,Bgrmystr2,"yeh, was hell on his back though"
24-01-2019T19:34:39,ThingsAreMoving,"1,5hrs left to the stream, btw"
24-01-2019T19:35:34,ThingsAreMoving,I feel the blood vessels in my eyes swelling
24-01-2019T19:35:46,Bgrmystr2,things pls
24-01-2019T19:37:15,ThingsAreMoving,no drugs... yet
24-01-2019T19:37:51,ThingsAreMoving,"btw, when I asked you to choose, why didn't you just pick one answer at random?"
24-01-2019T19:38:49,ThingsAreMoving,"Not like you know me or anything, as far as you know I could be bullshitting you, or even using for my own amusement."
24-01-2019T19:38:54,Bgrmystr2,I was gonna
24-01-2019T19:39:04,Bgrmystr2,but I realized it was either one of two things
24-01-2019T19:39:52,Bgrmystr2,"A, both answers were literally the same thing.. Or B, it was between Cocaine and Meth, and they're both equally bad imo as I don't actually know enough to label one worse than the other."
24-01-2019T19:40:34,ThingsAreMoving,"Not meth, amphetamine is a different thing than metaamphetamine"
24-01-2019T19:40:42,Bgrmystr2,and yeah you could have been bullshittting me so :u
24-01-2019T19:40:54,Bgrmystr2,I knew it was a type
24-01-2019T19:41:01,Bgrmystr2,but I figured if cocaine was on one side..
24-01-2019T19:41:13,Bgrmystr2,then what else would be on the other side?
24-01-2019T19:41:21,Bgrmystr2,"if it's not meth, the choice would be pretty obvious"
24-01-2019T19:41:27,ThingsAreMoving,I never had anything to do with meth. I guess if I had the chance I'd try it... once.
24-01-2019T19:42:01,ThingsAreMoving,I'm a curious beast.
24-01-2019T19:42:05,Bgrmystr2,"cuz amphetamines are not.. inherently dangerous, we know what they do, it just highly depends on the person"
24-01-2019T19:42:27,Bgrmystr2,"meth is, and I figured that'd be the only thing worthy of being up for debate"
24-01-2019T19:42:27,Bgrmystr2,xD
24-01-2019T19:42:36,ThingsAreMoving,fuck meth
24-01-2019T19:42:42,Bgrmystr2,yeah that's my thoughts
24-01-2019T19:42:57,ThingsAreMoving,if I can't ingest a drug it's not worth my time/too dangerous
24-01-2019T19:43:16,ThingsAreMoving,"that's why I didn't try heroin, even when I had the chance"
24-01-2019T19:43:26,ThingsAreMoving,fuck that
24-01-2019T19:43:51,Bgrmystr2,"but if it's not meth, then why even debate between cocaine, which is known to be dangerous, and amphetamines, which are not inherently dangerous, but can be if improperly used."
24-01-2019T19:44:11,Bgrmystr2,there's not even a debate
24-01-2019T19:44:15,Bgrmystr2,so I assumed the worst
24-01-2019T19:44:18,Bgrmystr2,and noped
24-01-2019T19:44:26,Bgrmystr2,:V
24-01-2019T19:44:36,ThingsAreMoving,How is cocaine inherently dangeour?
24-01-2019T19:44:40,ThingsAreMoving,dangerous*
24-01-2019T19:45:05,ThingsAreMoving,"I mean I'm not questioning your jugdement, I'm jhust curious of your... viewpoint?"
24-01-2019T19:45:22,Xexanoth,like most hard drugs your body can develop a physical addiction with nasty side effects
24-01-2019T19:45:26,Bgrmystr2,"far as I've learned, using it can damage braincells. It's not just a high like weed"
24-01-2019T19:45:31,Xexanoth,very quickly
24-01-2019T19:45:33,Bgrmystr2,and yeah it's a physical addiction thing too
24-01-2019T19:46:03,ThingsAreMoving,"yeaaaah, that\s something you develop when you're using stuff like that on a daily or weekly basis"
24-01-2019T19:46:14,ThingsAreMoving,like sugar
24-01-2019T19:47:04,Xexanoth,"uhm no, that's the problem"
24-01-2019T19:47:10,ThingsAreMoving,I use this stuff in quantities regular users wouldn't even consider as an appetiser
24-01-2019T19:47:25,Xexanoth,with stuff like heroin using it ONCE can cause your body to get a physical addiction
24-01-2019T19:47:25,ThingsAreMoving,and once every several weeks or months
24-01-2019T19:47:59,Bgrmystr2,"Like.. weed for example is like.. it impairs your brain's ability to have cohesive function.. see things, hear things, your nerves go nutso, but it's all temporary."
24-01-2019T19:48:10,ThingsAreMoving,"Alright, have you ever used it, or know someone who's used it once and got addicted to it, Xex?"
24-01-2019T19:48:31,ThingsAreMoving,Weed doesn't make you hear or see things.
24-01-2019T19:48:32,Bgrmystr2,"but hard drugs like cocaine, meth, heroin, etc, they're all permanant"
24-01-2019T19:48:41,ThingsAreMoving,unless it's super condensed brownie pot
24-01-2019T19:49:00,Xexanoth,"no, but heroin has been used in medicine for hundred years and peoiple have done extensive studies on it"
24-01-2019T19:49:00,Bgrmystr2,"I had a friend that had both of those, and he wasn't alone"
24-01-2019T19:49:06,ThingsAreMoving,"Had that once, laughed my ass of for two hours and then went to my room to listen to chillout music"
24-01-2019T19:49:24,ThingsAreMoving,and figured it's not what we eat that makes us
24-01-2019T19:49:40,ThingsAreMoving,it's what our parents ate before they had sex that makes us
24-01-2019T19:49:45,ThingsAreMoving,lol
24-01-2019T19:49:49,Bgrmystr2,XD
24-01-2019T19:50:08,ThingsAreMoving,i seriously had that thought while being high as a kite
24-01-2019T19:51:05,Xexanoth,"i just eat when i get high, alot"
24-01-2019T19:51:24,ThingsAreMoving,"Generally speaking I agree with you, Xex. However people have tolerances, and one dose of anything, no matter how much won't turn you into an addict."
24-01-2019T19:51:42,ThingsAreMoving,"unless you have the predispositions, like depression and stuff"
24-01-2019T19:52:10,Bgrmystr2,"fairly sure if you had a dose high enough to make you an addict, it could probably just kill you outright XD"
24-01-2019T19:52:22,ThingsAreMoving,but on the other hand any drug that makes you feel better while depressed is prone to make you addicted
24-01-2019T19:52:29,ThingsAreMoving,but that's just escapism
24-01-2019T19:53:21,ThingsAreMoving,thing with weed is that you can't overdose on it
24-01-2019T19:53:36,ThingsAreMoving,you just get the munchies and go to sleep
24-01-2019T19:53:52,Xexanoth,"uhm that might count for weaker drugs like weed or alcohol, but the hard stuff REALLY fucks with your brain chemistry"
24-01-2019T19:54:30,Xexanoth,"at that point, wether it takes you 1 or 3 shots to get addicted really doesn't make a difference anymore"
24-01-2019T19:55:40,ThingsAreMoving,"dunno, there's stuff I did not experience yet"
24-01-2019T19:56:04,ThingsAreMoving,"but I think with the proper mindset, one use won't turn you into an addict"
24-01-2019T19:56:37,Xexanoth,"lol, mindset has nothing to do with a physical addiction...."
24-01-2019T19:56:58,ThingsAreMoving,yeah it does
24-01-2019T19:57:01,Xexanoth,if your body wants something your mind doesn't do shit
24-01-2019T19:57:13,ThingsAreMoving,for instance I know I'm addicted to sugar and caffeine
24-01-2019T19:57:26,Xexanoth,that's why medicine differientiates between physical and psychological addictions
24-01-2019T19:57:55,ThingsAreMoving,"Xex, there's no way to get addicted after one use of anything"
24-01-2019T19:58:15,ThingsAreMoving,unless it's air
24-01-2019T19:58:23,ThingsAreMoving,or water
24-01-2019T19:58:31,ThingsAreMoving,or sleep
24-01-2019T19:59:03,Xexanoth,"well, guess you gotta tell all those doctors they are wrong"
24-01-2019T19:59:14,Xexanoth,not like those people studied the effects of drugs for years
24-01-2019T19:59:20,Bgrmystr2,xD
24-01-2019T19:59:24,ThingsAreMoving,I don't care what the textbooks say if I have experience saying otherwise.
24-01-2019T19:59:33,Xexanoth,so you done heroin?
24-01-2019T19:59:39,ThingsAreMoving,noep
24-01-2019T19:59:50,Xexanoth,but then you don't have any experience in that?
24-01-2019T20:00:08,Xexanoth,you can't compare stuff like weed or alcohol or sugar to hard drugs
24-01-2019T20:00:27,ThingsAreMoving,cocaine is not a hard drug
24-01-2019T20:00:33,ThingsAreMoving,Xexanoth 2019
24-01-2019T20:01:02,Xexanoth,that's like saying: i didn't hurt myself from crashing a bycicle so i know crashing with a motorcycle won't kill me
24-01-2019T20:01:25,ThingsAreMoving,It's all about the dose.
24-01-2019T20:01:27,Xexanoth,"""I didn't get addicted to cocaine therefore addiction is a myth - thingsaremoving"
24-01-2019T20:01:53,ThingsAreMoving,"correct, in this line of discussion"
24-01-2019T20:02:01,Xexanoth,"in other news, i never had to starve therefore starvation doesn't exist"
24-01-2019T20:02:41,ThingsAreMoving,I'm not addicted to cocaine after using it. You're not addicted to heroin and you've never used it.
24-01-2019T20:02:54,ThingsAreMoving,How can you be sure you'd get addicted from one use?
24-01-2019T20:03:19,Xexanoth,because there's tons of people who got addicted after using it once?
24-01-2019T20:04:00,ThingsAreMoving,Alright. I give. Heroin may be the wonderful thing that gets people addicted.
24-01-2019T20:04:24,ThingsAreMoving,We should make more and kill off those junkies as fast as possible.
24-01-2019T20:04:47,Xexanoth,...well that discussion took a sharp turn

24-01-2019T21:18:27,SageSaga,im hoping they can just remove the liquid from inside the cyst and hit it with a shot to stop it from getting bigger

24-01-2019T21:20:12,Twokinds,Hi~~~~ :D
24-01-2019T21:20:15,SageSaga,"they used to call this kinda Cyst a ""Bible Cyst"""

24-01-2019T21:20:25,SageSaga,because they would smash it with a heavy book

24-01-2019T21:20:35,unsteddyphoenix,Uh
24-01-2019T21:20:35,w0lfmare,"Hey Tom, wolcome o/"
24-01-2019T21:20:43,SageSaga,turns out thats not a good idea though- it works sometimes
24-01-2019T21:20:55,unsteddyphoenix,Depends if youre a good christian or not
24-01-2019T21:20:58,Combak,Well then.
24-01-2019T21:20:58,SageSaga,but sometimes it causes damage to the wrist and or gets infected
24-01-2019T21:20:59,InTheLionsDen,Cyst Smash! Start of infection.
24-01-2019T21:21:04,Twokinds,I have never had a cyst. I hope I never will.
24-01-2019T21:21:08,Combak,^
24-01-2019T21:21:18,Combak,It's so wierd!
24-01-2019T21:21:46,Combak,"I mean, really! Your body just makes a little ball of stuff around a spot? Why!?"
24-01-2019T21:21:58,InTheLionsDen,All the Cyst and the walls need to be removed. Look up Dr Pimple Popper on the internet. She has her own TV show now.
24-01-2019T21:22:01,Combak,And it isn't even little sometimes!
24-01-2019T21:22:01,ZRO4825,"Because reasons, obviously. Duh~"
24-01-2019T21:22:55,ThingsAreMoving,"Cysts are not a good thing. But there are worse things, like pilonidal sinuses."
24-01-2019T21:22:57,BadFoMo,I don't think my 'friend' has searched for Cyst popping with a book. ...Yet.
24-01-2019T21:23:05,ThingsAreMoving,those are literal pain in the ass
24-01-2019T21:23:26,unsteddyphoenix,I Incyst we change the topic ugh
24-01-2019T21:23:31,SageSaga,its dangerous to remove a cyst that goes inside a join though- its better off to drain it and stunt it
24-01-2019T21:23:52,ZRO4825,"That is not your incision to make, Unsteddy."

24-01-2019T22:06:46,Combak,"Yeah, they're equal Things."
24-01-2019T22:06:51,QuinnMalachite,it's probably right
24-01-2019T22:06:59,unsteddyphoenix,Lot of redundancies that people ignore

24-01-2019T22:08:50,Bgrmystr2,"lol Things, there's actually a subtle difference between a 'did you do it' and 'have you done it' as the 2nd one has implications of doing so in the past, and the first one meaning moreso did you do something more recently."
24-01-2019T22:08:59,Bgrmystr2,but they're prettymuch used interchangably

24-01-2019T22:43:28,CrRAR,That... sounds like a path to the dark side.

24-01-2019T23:56:00,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Things bro is a pyromancer
24-01-2019T23:56:19,ThingsAreMoving,"when it's hot and I have to wear latex gloves, my hands turn into a spring"
24-01-2019T23:56:39,ThingsAreMoving,so much water loss
24-01-2019T23:56:54,Ordithus,Wear nitrile gloves if you can.
