21-11-2019T21:39:05,Dadrobit,We really haven't seen Kei with in a circumstance that he can even consider her tbf. Dude tends to be real busy with his business of saving the town.
21-11-2019T21:39:05,ThingsAreMoving,was it a good dream?

21-11-2019T21:40:19,Dadrobit,Also. She's a Dragon. Not exactly most folks ideal partner to seek a relationship with.
21-11-2019T21:40:43,SageSaga,"so i messaged who i thought it was on my phone and said ""Hey- i forgot what you looked like"" and then the guy answered his phone- then took a selfie and i was like ""Heeey Purple!"""

21-11-2019T21:58:07,ThingsAreMoving,"We don't know the rules for dragon shapeshifting in TK universe, ZRO. She might have no choice in regards to what form she takes as a human"
21-11-2019T21:58:11,SageSaga,A lot of dragons arent considered lizards
21-11-2019T21:58:25,Shierna,Eesh!
21-11-2019T21:58:47,Shierna,I will consider myself duly dogpiled!
21-11-2019T21:59:06,ThingsAreMoving,"That's a new concept to me, Sage."
21-11-2019T21:59:19,SageSaga,all of the dragons from Dungeons and Dragons- are not reptiles
21-11-2019T21:59:35,ZRO4825,They are dragons. Not lizards. ^_^
21-11-2019T21:59:35,SageSaga,it's actually a very bad insult to call them that
21-11-2019T21:59:36,Shierna,Nor Pern.
21-11-2019T22:00:03,SageSaga,and in Twokinds- well they are like magic manifested right?
21-11-2019T22:00:26,Shierna,I was being facetious...
21-11-2019T22:00:27,ThingsAreMoving,"huh, wasn't aware of that. Aren't dragons like... highly evolved magic reptiles?"

21-11-2019T22:01:20,Shierna,Birds=/= reptiles.
21-11-2019T22:01:28,ThingsAreMoving,birds came from reptiles
21-11-2019T22:01:36,ThingsAreMoving,through evolution
21-11-2019T22:01:37,CrimsonHelsing,"lol CrRAR ""Mekkanites"" xD"

21-11-2019T22:01:58,ThingsAreMoving,true
21-11-2019T22:02:11,Shierna,"The branch split before dinosaurs. Birds evolved from dinosaurs, which were also not really reptiles."
21-11-2019T22:02:12,SageSaga,think about it this way- in most fantasy worlds Dragons are created by a god of some kind- not formed from evolution
21-11-2019T22:02:29,CrRAR,mmm
21-11-2019T22:02:32,CrimsonHelsing,hence their immense power
21-11-2019T22:02:42,CrimsonHelsing,usually
21-11-2019T22:03:02,ThingsAreMoving,"That makes sense, but so are other races"
21-11-2019T22:03:05,SageSaga,that goes for Tolkien and all of Dungeons and Dragons- all of their worlds they were their own thing
21-11-2019T22:03:12,ThingsAreMoving,and we still classify elves and dwarves as hummanoids
21-11-2019T22:03:20,ZRO4825,"Reni, meanwhile, was formed of cross-species baby-making. :ptv-ohmy::stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:"
21-11-2019T22:03:23,SageSaga,yes- so in D&D Humans didnt evolve from apes
21-11-2019T22:03:33,ThingsAreMoving,even though they are usually created by their deities
21-11-2019T22:03:40,SageSaga,humanoid does not mean human - it means human like
21-11-2019T22:03:41,Shierna,"In a few fictions, dragons predate gods..."
21-11-2019T22:04:07,ThingsAreMoving,"just so we're clear, I'm not arguing. I find this fascinating"
21-11-2019T22:04:21,SageSaga,yeah the 3 Dragons of Eberon is one example of Dragons predating gods in fantasy
21-11-2019T22:04:22,Shierna,"BTW, IRL, humans did not evolve from apes."
21-11-2019T22:04:29,CrimsonHelsing,"heck in Elder Scrolls, plenty of them are immortal (don't mistake that word for invincible lol)"
21-11-2019T22:04:33,Tharkis,"Heck even in everquest, first came the dragons, crated by the God Veshan when she struck the planet with her claw, creating life"
21-11-2019T22:04:34,SageSaga,funny enough one of those dragons was called Eberon...
21-11-2019T22:04:49,Shierna,"They evolved alongside apes, from monkey-like ancestors."
21-11-2019T22:05:14,CrRAR,Natani's going to be curious about Reni's adeptness at anti-bustyness.
21-11-2019T22:05:15,McClaw,I like that color choice. It looks good on her.

21-11-2019T22:05:37,SageSaga,I thought the latest was that we evolved from great apes not monkeys?
21-11-2019T22:05:38,Tharkis,wait wait !  i can break out the original 21 year old smackplay video introduction for everquest !\o/

21-11-2019T22:47:25,NezumiYuki,I need to watch more of StrikeWitches though.... but I think I got the jest of it.
21-11-2019T22:47:27,Shierna,"Well, Flora would have to have hers based on the P-41..."

21-11-2019T22:50:14,Ordithus,"Keep the chat clean, please"
21-11-2019T22:50:18,Shierna,Sorry...
21-11-2019T22:50:28,Shierna,Momentary lapse
21-11-2019T22:50:58,NezumiYuki,Oh great.... wonderful... Now I'm immediately envisioning Harriet in sailor moon disguise....  xD
21-11-2019T22:51:38,Shierna,Wait... wherr does Rose fit in the Sailor Scout thing?
21-11-2019T22:51:53,NezumiYuki,Ooo good question Shierna
21-11-2019T22:51:56,NezumiYuki,hmmmm
21-11-2019T22:52:32,Shierna,We already know Eric has to be the dude with the top hat...
21-11-2019T22:52:39,NezumiYuki,XDDD
21-11-2019T22:52:51,NezumiYuki,oh WAIT!!!
21-11-2019T22:53:03,NezumiYuki,Eric as Tenchi form Tenichi Muyo!   omg....
21-11-2019T22:53:09,SageSaga,Rose can be Queen Beryl
21-11-2019T22:53:21,NezumiYuki,Oh awesome answer there Ron!
21-11-2019T22:54:10,NezumiYuki,Wait now... if Eric is Tenchi... Who'd Kats best fit in as?   Sasami?  Ayeka?
21-11-2019T22:54:19,Shierna,I was thinking of Erik as Subaru...
21-11-2019T22:54:26,NezumiYuki,Certainly NOT Ryoko I know that much
21-11-2019T22:54:44,NezumiYuki,Natani seems more like Ryoko
21-11-2019T22:54:49,Shierna,Isekai Eric would be hilarious.
21-11-2019T22:54:58,SageSaga,wouldnt Keith make more sense as Tenchi?
21-11-2019T22:55:00,NezumiYuki,oh fffffffffffff  xDDD
21-11-2019T22:55:38,Shierna,It's beach day and Eric keeps dying of nosebleeds and starting over.
21-11-2019T22:56:21,SageSaga,Natani as Ryoko and Laura as Ayeka
21-11-2019T22:56:29,NezumiYuki,XDDD
21-11-2019T22:57:05,NezumiYuki,Flora as Mihoshi?
21-11-2019T22:57:24,SageSaga,I think Kat is a better Mihoshi- or Karen
21-11-2019T22:57:38,NezumiYuki,Karen me thinks
21-11-2019T22:57:55,NezumiYuki,hmmm on second thought.......
21-11-2019T22:58:22,SageSaga,Rose would be Washu?
21-11-2019T22:58:31,NezumiYuki,oh lawd help us!!!
21-11-2019T22:58:54,SageSaga,Nibbly would have to be Ryo-Ohki
21-11-2019T22:59:01,NezumiYuki,YUS!!!!!
21-11-2019T22:59:15,Shierna,I have no helpful iput on this line of reasoning.
21-11-2019T22:59:22,SageSaga,Nora would probably make a better Washu
21-11-2019T22:59:31,SageSaga,Rose's hair just fits though
21-11-2019T22:59:43,Mihari,Not like any of the rest match hair
21-11-2019T22:59:45,SageSaga,hair color*
21-11-2019T22:59:50,NezumiYuki,Nahhhhh Lady Nora would be better off as Goddess Tokimi
21-11-2019T23:00:00,Twokinds,?
21-11-2019T23:00:19,Shierna,Still... Sabre Nora.
21-11-2019T23:00:21,Twokinds,Are we comparing characters to anime
21-11-2019T23:00:22,SageSaga,we are apparently doing Twokinds character as X anime
21-11-2019T23:00:35,NezumiYuki,oh shiiiii Tom caught us.... Scatter!!!!
21-11-2019T23:00:54,SageSaga,and not really comparing so much as - if you did character swaps for a drawing- where would they best fit
21-11-2019T23:01:15,Shierna,hides under the couch.
21-11-2019T23:01:32,Twokinds,Oh I see
21-11-2019T23:01:34,SageSaga,if you did a Parody of Tenchi for example
21-11-2019T23:01:48,Twokinds,Karen's based on Kaolla from Love Hina
21-11-2019T23:02:01,NezumiYuki,Ohhhhhhh! <3
21-11-2019T23:02:28,Shierna,Well hell. Add that to my list.
21-11-2019T23:02:40,SageSaga,dont watch the dub
21-11-2019T23:02:51,Shierna,No shit
21-11-2019T23:02:54,CrRAR,haha
21-11-2019T23:03:14,Shierna,Er... oops
21-11-2019T23:03:14,SageSaga,there are good dubs of some shows
21-11-2019T23:03:21,SageSaga,Love Hina is not one of those
21-11-2019T23:03:37,Shierna,Demonslayer ain't one.
21-11-2019T23:03:43,Twokinds,There was a lot of bad ones
21-11-2019T23:03:44,NezumiYuki,Girls und Panzer's english dub was ATROCIOUS
21-11-2019T23:03:53,Twokinds,I never realized just how bad Tenchi Muyo was at the time
21-11-2019T23:04:09,Shierna,Ghost Stories....
21-11-2019T23:04:18,SageSaga,"Love Hina translated a girl saying ""Weee!"" to ""Look at me. I am an airplane."""
21-11-2019T23:04:26,Ordithus,"Internet lives again, yay"
21-11-2019T23:04:36,SageSaga,Ghost Stories is great though
21-11-2019T23:04:36,NezumiYuki,welcome back Ord
21-11-2019T23:05:12,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-rainehappy: thanks
21-11-2019T23:05:17,Shierna,BECAUSE of the dub. The original was a horrid flop.
21-11-2019T23:05:19,NezumiYuki,no prob!
21-11-2019T23:06:01,SageSaga,"yeah, the dub was basically official abridged anime"
21-11-2019T23:06:12,Shierna,They actually released a Japanese sub of the English dub.
21-11-2019T23:06:33,NezumiYuki,I'll say it again.. Dang Ron... That's how you chibi a humon Reni!  <3
21-11-2019T23:06:44,SageSaga,i hadnt heard that- not sure if thats true considering a lot of it wouldnt make sense
21-11-2019T23:06:47,KUBAYAT,What software that he use to draw?
21-11-2019T23:07:09,NezumiYuki,@kubayat  That would be Paint Tool SAI
21-11-2019T23:07:34,KUBAYAT,Maybe u are right :3
21-11-2019T23:07:47,SageSaga,if Kuba is talking about Nekonny
21-11-2019T23:08:06,Ordithus,Roooon this is adorable
21-11-2019T23:08:25,NezumiYuki,For Twokinds... that would be PhotoShop... I'm not sure about SageSaga though.
21-11-2019T23:08:41,SageSaga,Clipstudio
21-11-2019T23:08:45,NezumiYuki,Looks like sage is using PS as well but I can't be certain.
21-11-2019T23:08:47,NezumiYuki,Ahhhhhhh!
21-11-2019T23:08:58,Ordithus,You can read it at the top of his stream if you squint real hard
21-11-2019T23:09:30,AnuSekaniArt,"Holy smokes Ron, this is too adorable <3 <3 <3"

21-11-2019T23:11:34,SageSaga,i think my threat holds more weight
21-11-2019T23:12:27,ZRO4825,"About a hammer's worth more weight, I'd wager."
21-11-2019T23:12:51,Nekonny,>.>
21-11-2019T23:13:14,clXvisTV,Sometime’s I feel like Natani  like jere’s An example. The mind sync thing  it’s like my Hip hop side  and my metal side is fighting over control like taking over my body and making me say stuff I regret!

21-11-2019T23:40:18,SageSaga,nice Rima
21-11-2019T23:40:24,RimaDraws,so ty sage
21-11-2019T23:40:34,SageSaga,was that the importance of Art? Or did ya go with something else?
21-11-2019T23:40:55,SageSaga,importance/influence
21-11-2019T23:41:03,RimaDraws,"importance of art. how it inspires, communicates with others, and expresses ideas"
21-11-2019T23:41:14,SageSaga,sweet
21-11-2019T23:41:21,RimaDraws,yea and i got a great grade
21-11-2019T23:41:22,SageSaga,glad to hear it was well recieved
21-11-2019T23:41:25,VerdantDargonArts,hewwo
21-11-2019T23:41:33,SageSaga,yo Verdant
21-11-2019T23:41:51,RimaDraws,and i did the entirety of art not just painting and drawing. it was all forms of art
21-11-2019T23:41:53,IronHorseComics,sorry I was busy doing a sketch because I felt like it
21-11-2019T23:41:58,RimaDraws,hi ver
21-11-2019T23:42:41,iliar,"About the ""no breast."" Since Reni is a dragon, that is, not a mammal. Perhaps for her, as for a non-mammal, a large breast is not something attractive."
21-11-2019T23:42:47,iliar,"In this case, it is logical that if she created this form on the basis of her own preferences, then even in the human form she does not have a breast."
21-11-2019T23:42:58,iliar,"However, in human form, Reni looks very young. I even had doubts that she was an adult. So I have a question. We know that 20 years. But how much is this for dragons?"
21-11-2019T23:43:22,MuonNeutrino,"well, given they live a very, very long time, perhaps it's younger than it would be for humans?"
21-11-2019T23:43:24,NezumiYuki,Whoa... Iliar... brain much over this topic?  :D
21-11-2019T23:43:46,Nekonny,"oops, got distracted aagin"
21-11-2019T23:43:49,Twokinds,20 year old dragon is 20 years old
21-11-2019T23:43:59,Nekonny,so what did i miss
21-11-2019T23:44:14,MuonNeutrino,"and as for the chest thing, it might also just be that it feels strange to her since she's not used to having them, not even just that she doesn't think of them as attractive"
21-11-2019T23:44:16,Ordithus,Could be Nora's preference for larger breasts has to do with her less than innocent nature
21-11-2019T23:44:33,KiTA,"Um, she might just be flat.  A cups do exist."
21-11-2019T23:44:37,ZRO4825,Nora knows /exactly/ what those do to other people. >:3c
21-11-2019T23:44:55,NezumiYuki,"Deep philosophical discussions on Dragon anatomy, Ron... You really didn't miss much.  xD"
21-11-2019T23:44:55,InTheLionsDen,She is just wearing a top based on a design and magic type she saw Natani using.
21-11-2019T23:45:17,ZRO4825,"Main point of the argument, KiTA, is that she's a natural shapeshifter. She's not exactly constrained to any particular size, at least to our knowledge. :P"
21-11-2019T23:45:22,MuonNeutrino,.... did she actually see natani using that top? i don't think so
21-11-2019T23:45:33,InTheLionsDen,She likes magic things. She can tell.
21-11-2019T23:45:36,HoverdudeXL,Back
21-11-2019T23:45:40,NezumiYuki,Princess Jasmine Reni comes to mind.... just Reni's top is orange and not violet...
21-11-2019T23:45:58,Ordithus,"Natani was using it when they went to ""imprison"" Zen and the others"
21-11-2019T23:46:14,Nekonny,Didn't she say she wasn't good at shapeshifting?
21-11-2019T23:46:25,MuonNeutrino,"yeah but nat was wearing the usual vest on top of it, so unless reni can just sense the magic (which I suppose is plausible enough) she wouldn't know about it"
21-11-2019T23:46:30,KiTA,"I'm sure she has a ""natural"" human form that she takes when not customizing it intentionally -- which is likely what we're seeing right now"
21-11-2019T23:46:32,Nekonny,or am I thinking of something else?
21-11-2019T23:46:50,MuonNeutrino,"well, she said she wasn't good at *magic*, but i don't think she specifically said shapeshifting"
21-11-2019T23:46:52,w0lfmare,Maybe what she meant was she was bashful about shapeshifting
21-11-2019T23:47:19,Dimensional,"She's not that good at shapeshifting, but she's part human, so taking a human form is more natural for her than any other dragon at the same age."
21-11-2019T23:47:29,MuonNeutrino,"and she specifically called out shapeshifting as a natural talent of dragons, and also her conversation with karen the last time we saw them implied she'd shapeshifted into a dog at some point in the past"
21-11-2019T23:48:18,MuonNeutrino,so I think at the least she's better at shapeshifting than at magic in general
21-11-2019T23:49:59,NezumiYuki,"Ya know... Tom, all you need to do is give Reni some baggy harem pants type leggings and change her outfit color from orange to violet and poof... Jasmine Reni!  <3"
21-11-2019T23:50:31,ZRO4825,"Better idea. Reni in a Shantae outfit. Same idea, but with bellydancing! :3"
21-11-2019T23:50:42,NezumiYuki,Ohhhhhhh! <3
21-11-2019T23:50:46,MuonNeutrino,thinking about it... is this the first human with a dark skin tone we've seen?
21-11-2019T23:51:26,AspiringNoodle,Does trace's hand count? haha
21-11-2019T23:51:46,Nekonny,^_^'
21-11-2019T23:52:07,AspiringNoodle,Inb4 the next month has 3+ Reni sketches a week :P
21-11-2019T23:52:09,iliar,"""20 year old dragon is 20 years old"" - Yeah, typical Tom. Absolutely accurate and absolutely meaningless answer."
21-11-2019T23:52:31,MuonNeutrino,"well, human reni is not a spoiler anymore, so i could totally see a ton of sketch requests with her >.>"
21-11-2019T23:52:42,Lunarsprint,Sup
21-11-2019T23:52:46,SageSaga,i dont think thats meaningless
21-11-2019T23:53:01,AspiringNoodle,Technically accurate answer is technically accurate
21-11-2019T23:53:12,NezumiYuki,I just want to know...
21-11-2019T23:53:17,CrRAR,hehe
21-11-2019T23:53:19,iliar,Okay What does it mean?
21-11-2019T23:53:21,MuonNeutrino,"also, Eric, i swear to god, you better leave her alone or ima smite you"
21-11-2019T23:53:28,SageSaga,it's pretty simple to say that dragons might be long lived but share growth like humans
21-11-2019T23:53:31,NezumiYuki,If Reni can still speak her native language in human form?    xD
21-11-2019T23:53:41,MuonNeutrino,dragons don't have a native language
21-11-2019T23:53:42,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-reniderp:
21-11-2019T23:53:43,SageSaga,so a 20 year old dragon is the same maturity as a human
21-11-2019T23:53:43,NezumiYuki,RArrarruuuuu rar!
21-11-2019T23:53:57,AspiringNoodle,Wait... so...
21-11-2019T23:54:05,iliar,Maybe. But this does not follow from this phrase.
21-11-2019T23:54:10,MuonNeutrino,"srsly eric, buzz off and leave the adorkable dragon alone"
21-11-2019T23:54:12,ZRO4825,"Seemed like a pretty straight-forward answer to me, lol."
21-11-2019T23:54:17,AspiringNoodle,"Nora is the equivalent of a 2,000 year old hyooman?!? :ptv-shock:"
21-11-2019T23:54:29,IronHorseComics,she ancient yo
21-11-2019T23:54:33,Ordithus,"If a 2000 year old human was still healthy, yeah"
21-11-2019T23:54:34,AspiringNoodle,*smited*
21-11-2019T23:54:41,SageSaga,ya'
21-11-2019T23:54:46,AspiringNoodle,"Guess she didn't like that, aha"
21-11-2019T23:54:49,SageSaga,ya'll be silly
21-11-2019T23:54:52,NezumiYuki,Beats Yoda by 1100 years...
21-11-2019T23:55:10,IronHorseComics,"rubbish, I'm not silly, I super serious *sticks tongue out*"
21-11-2019T23:56:09,SageSaga,you reach a physical maturity level at around a certain age- im saying that once that is reached then dragons just dont die of old age
21-11-2019T23:56:11,AspiringNoodle,"I would say I'm serious, but I drop stuff at work all the time"
21-11-2019T23:56:11,iliar,"Perhaps the fact is that English is not my native language. But for me, this phrase sounds like ""20 year old dragon lived 20 years."""
21-11-2019T23:56:27,AspiringNoodle,"That would be accurate, yes."
21-11-2019T23:56:39,SageSaga,"no- when we say in english that someone ""Is 20 years old"" it means they are 20 years in age"
21-11-2019T23:56:54,AspiringNoodle,:upside_down:
21-11-2019T23:56:58,PhantomOfTheKnight,Is Nekonny still going or is he taking a break
21-11-2019T23:57:03,MuonNeutrino,"yes, but the point being it sounded like a typical tom non-answer >.>"
21-11-2019T23:57:09,MuonNeutrino,i read it that way too and i *am* a native speaker
21-11-2019T23:57:12,Ordithus,In this case I would interpret Tom's weird answer as she has the maturity of a 20 year old human
21-11-2019T23:57:18,AspiringNoodle,But... his statement is completely true
21-11-2019T23:57:27,IronHorseComics,someone who's not quite sure how to adult yet
21-11-2019T23:57:46,ZRO4825,Statement seemed to say exactly what needed to be said imo. 20 is 20. Have fun! lol
21-11-2019T23:57:56,MuonNeutrino,i mean to be fair there is a lot of variation between individuals and even a 20 year old human isn't *that* old
21-11-2019T23:58:10,Ordithus,"I sure hope a 20 year old human isn't old, or wew"
21-11-2019T23:58:14,Ordithus,I'm ancient
21-11-2019T23:58:15,ZRO4825,"No, but damned near every 20 year old *thinks* they're that old. :rofl:"
21-11-2019T23:58:28,IronHorseComics,I didn't
21-11-2019T23:58:29,NezumiYuki,With hindsight... 20 year old me was pretty much a child still....  :P
21-11-2019T23:58:34,IronHorseComics,I felt old at 25
21-11-2019T23:58:38,SageSaga,generally speaking it means shes a young adult
21-11-2019T23:58:38,MuonNeutrino,"given the sort of social isolation that i could see coming from her position in human society, i could see reni coming off as more 'young' than normal even if 20 is as old for a dragon as it is for humans"
21-11-2019T23:58:39,Twokinds,Dragons are about as smart as humans. So a dragon who's had 20 years to learn has about as much mental development as a human who's 20.
21-11-2019T23:58:40,AspiringNoodle,"As you get older, you will have multiple ""I'm too old for this ****"" moments :P"
21-11-2019T23:59:01,RimaDraws,iron how old are you
21-11-2019T23:59:17,NezumiYuki,Oh believe me Noodles... I've actualy said and felt this a few times already regarding various things..   xD
21-11-2019T23:59:21,MuonNeutrino,i felt old the first time a little kid called me 'mister' >.>
21-11-2019T23:59:23,IronHorseComics,26...
21-11-2019T23:59:26,RimaDraws,omh
21-11-2019T23:59:28,RimaDraws,omg
21-11-2019T23:59:45,IronHorseComics,"keep thinking I'm 27, it's weird"
