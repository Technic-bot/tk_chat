30-08-2019T00:21:00,MarvTheHugPharaoh,get them noms

30-08-2019T00:44:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Its the weak point
30-08-2019T00:46:38,RimaDraws,ty
30-08-2019T00:53:05,SageSaga,fyi - if you start watching an anime and boob movements seem excessive- you're probably watching a show heavy on the fan service- so dont be surprised when those boobs pop out at some point
30-08-2019T00:55:20,RimaDraws,i watched monster musume and its full of that
30-08-2019T00:56:13,SageSaga,yep- and that was a super adult fan service anime
30-08-2019T00:56:43,RimaDraws,i loved it
30-08-2019T00:57:46,SpazztasticKiwi,did you get the good noms
30-08-2019T00:57:49,SageSaga,i really didnt- the main male character was such a blank slate and when you focus on a blank slate you get bored or your fill it with what you want
30-08-2019T00:58:06,SageSaga,i rarely have good noms- i settle for not bad noms
30-08-2019T00:58:19,SpazztasticKiwi,yea?
30-08-2019T00:58:27,RimaDraws,i want more neo yokio and i think i wont get it because i havent heard anything yet
30-08-2019T00:59:05,SageSaga,I work hard for Neo Yokio to not happen
30-08-2019T00:59:14,RimaDraws,well i like it
30-08-2019T01:00:36,SageSaga,i know- and i get why people can enjoy it- but it was so bad to me- i want those animators to work on something better
30-08-2019T01:00:45,RimaDraws,like what
30-08-2019T01:01:33,SageSaga,Artificial Incident the Anime... :D
30-08-2019T01:01:41,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:eyes:
30-08-2019T01:01:41,RimaDraws,haha
30-08-2019T01:01:46,SageSaga,not really-  i wouldnt trust them with it XD
30-08-2019T01:02:00,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Even if it was studio bones?
30-08-2019T01:02:11,RimaDraws,i want more sailor moon crystal for season four and five but they wont bring it out
30-08-2019T01:02:14,RimaDraws,i hate them
30-08-2019T01:04:01,SageSaga,I really didnt like the remake of Sailor moon - i was watching season 1 and couldnt get over how bad it looked o_o;
30-08-2019T01:04:14,RimaDraws,it actually looked better than the original
30-08-2019T01:04:16,RimaDraws,change my mind
30-08-2019T01:04:17,RimaDraws,lol
30-08-2019T01:04:24,RimaDraws,the comedy in the old one was terrible
30-08-2019T01:04:34,RimaDraws,it didnt follow the manga
30-08-2019T01:04:48,RimaDraws,it got better in season 3
30-08-2019T01:06:20,RimaDraws,yea that was season 1
30-08-2019T01:06:32,MarvTheHugPharaoh,those eyes
30-08-2019T01:06:46,RimaDraws,once you get to season three its better plus they made way better edits for the dvd releases so thats trash for evidence
30-08-2019T01:07:06,RimaDraws,they made edits on everything once it was all on dvd
30-08-2019T01:07:08,SageSaga,im sorry- did you read what i said?
30-08-2019T01:07:09,Mihari,"The original did follow the manga, the DUB did not."
30-08-2019T01:07:16,RimaDraws,no the dub did not
30-08-2019T01:07:31,Mihari,The original also killed off all the senshi.
30-08-2019T01:07:44,RimaDraws,yes it looked bad in season one but guess what they fixed it after releases on dvd
30-08-2019T01:07:59,SageSaga,well i dont buy my anime on DVDs
30-08-2019T01:08:05,SageSaga,or Blu-ray
30-08-2019T01:08:10,RimaDraws,yea and that wasnt okay. in the manga it was serenity who was supposed to die and not the senshi
30-08-2019T01:08:25,RimaDraws,to each their own
30-08-2019T01:08:31,Mihari,They died protecting her because that was their jobs XD
30-08-2019T01:08:36,RimaDraws,yea
30-08-2019T01:08:46,RimaDraws,but ive been a SM fan since 97
30-08-2019T01:08:57,RimaDraws,i disliked the entire first season
30-08-2019T01:09:06,RimaDraws,there was too much filler and not enough story
30-08-2019T01:09:25,Mihari,Sailor Stars was my favorite
30-08-2019T01:09:30,RimaDraws,i never got to see that
30-08-2019T01:09:34,Mihari,That's a crying shame.
30-08-2019T01:10:01,RimaDraws,well i wanted to but when they were going to release it in the US i had no way of watching it. i waited years. at some point i will have to watch it
30-08-2019T01:10:17,RimaDraws,they pretty much cancelled it in the US
30-08-2019T01:11:06,Mihari,"Course they did, lesbians, males transforming into females, teenagers getting killed. No chance they would have done that XD"
30-08-2019T01:11:19,RimaDraws,yea and thats why it partially got cancelled
30-08-2019T01:11:41,SageSaga,I only got to see it because Mihari sent it to me :D
30-08-2019T01:11:43,RimaDraws,at some point i will watch it but idk if i can go back to the cringe lol
30-08-2019T01:11:47,RimaDraws,lucky you
30-08-2019T01:12:10,Mihari,Stars is closer to Crystal visually
30-08-2019T01:12:18,RimaDraws,i can see why
30-08-2019T01:12:32,Mihari,Just... better XD
30-08-2019T01:12:50,Mihari,I want to say more but dun want to spoil.
30-08-2019T01:13:08,RimaDraws,well ive been re reading the manga and i have spoiled myself a bit
30-08-2019T01:13:10,RimaDraws,people die i think
30-08-2019T01:13:12,RimaDraws,pretty sure
30-08-2019T01:13:24,Mihari,"Yah, they showed that in the trailer XD"
30-08-2019T01:13:32,RimaDraws,i didnt see the trailer
30-08-2019T01:13:59,Mihari,Sure you can find it on youtube somewhere XD
30-08-2019T01:14:08,Mihari,In fact you can probably find all of stars on youtube XD
30-08-2019T01:14:17,RimaDraws,yea but ill save it for later when i watch the entire thing
30-08-2019T01:14:38,SageSaga,all done
30-08-2019T01:14:46,MarvTheHugPharaoh,very well done Sage

30-08-2019T14:28:10,AnuSekaniArt,I'm just glad I have a 3 day weekend for a change. Gonna use it to draw  more ^^
30-08-2019T14:34:35,RimaDraws,same maybe
30-08-2019T14:34:47,AnuSekaniArt,Nice ^^
30-08-2019T14:35:26,AnuSekaniArt,I did a little sketch the other night playing around with layers and predictive trace
30-08-2019T14:35:56,AnuSekaniArt,Which is *really* nice lol
30-08-2019T14:40:12,AnuSekaniArt,But I should focus on traditional this weekend.
30-08-2019T14:48:24,SageSaga,brb
30-08-2019T14:48:27,RimaDraws,ok
30-08-2019T14:51:03,AnuSekaniArt,Oki!
30-08-2019T14:51:27,SageSaga,back
30-08-2019T14:51:45,AnuSekaniArt,WB ^^
30-08-2019T14:52:19,AnuSekaniArt,"So Sage, what gave you the inspiration for AI?"
30-08-2019T14:56:03,SageSaga,I've been a big fan of stories that take place in other worlds or inside of video games for a really long time- and Yosh! actually started on a .Hack//signs forum  back in ye old times
30-08-2019T14:57:06,SageSaga,so I've always wanted to do a story like this and have been planning a lot of different stories and I finally came up with a group of characters and plot points that i liked and that worked well together
30-08-2019T14:58:01,AnuSekaniArt,"OIhhhh I see, very cool!"
30-08-2019T14:58:16,AnuSekaniArt,Yeah I always loved stories in other worlds myself.
30-08-2019T14:58:31,AnuSekaniArt,Still have a lot of work to do on my own characters though haha
30-08-2019T14:59:22,SageSaga,i still have a lot of stories i want to do - but so little time
30-08-2019T15:00:40,AnuSekaniArt,"Heh, ever since I started working full time"
30-08-2019T15:00:42,AnuSekaniArt,I feel that
30-08-2019T15:00:59,AnuSekaniArt,Debated getting a part time job only so I had more time to do that
30-08-2019T15:01:24,AnuSekaniArt,But I don't know if I am ready for that
30-08-2019T15:02:57,RimaDraws,i need to do my comic but it might not happen ever
30-08-2019T15:03:08,AnuSekaniArt,I feel that Rima ^^;
30-08-2019T15:07:17,AnuSekaniArt,But ultimately I know I could do it if I put my mind to it and put the time in
30-08-2019T15:07:39,ZRO4825,I could if I suddenly gained a buttload of artistic skill.
30-08-2019T15:08:10,RimaDraws,mine is garbage
30-08-2019T15:08:17,AnuSekaniArt,Same XD I know it'll take time but I'm willing to put that in
30-08-2019T15:09:12,SpazztasticKiwi,anyone got the new ios
30-08-2019T15:09:22,AnuSekaniArt,"Allo Kiwi, and I'm on Android XD"
30-08-2019T15:09:26,AnuSekaniArt,So nope X3
30-08-2019T15:09:32,RimaDraws,what do you mean new ios
30-08-2019T15:09:51,SpazztasticKiwi,update 12.4.1
30-08-2019T15:09:59,RimaDraws,oh no i didnt do that yet
30-08-2019T15:10:14,RimaDraws,what's special about it this time
30-08-2019T15:10:23,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t know
30-08-2019T15:10:51,SpazztasticKiwi,last update they changed the quick menu look and I wasn’t too into it
30-08-2019T15:11:09,SpazztasticKiwi,so I’ve not been into constantly updating
30-08-2019T15:11:12,SpazztasticKiwi,plus time
30-08-2019T15:11:14,ZRO4825,"New iOS updates never seem to change anything for me, then again I'm on an ancient-by-current-standards 5C"
30-08-2019T15:11:49,SageSaga,wasnt the new iOS update for that breach?
30-08-2019T15:13:22,SageSaga,"the news about that was like ""Hey, we made it so your phone cant be compromised by this thing! Oh but it probably already was and it included stuff like your password and account information- so if you did get hit by it you should change that"""
30-08-2019T15:14:19,SageSaga,"""So how do I know if my data was compromised?"" ""Don't ask us- we aren't a help center!"""
30-08-2019T15:14:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve gotten help whenever I’ve talked to apple service
30-08-2019T15:15:21,SpazztasticKiwi,"never asked about breach stuff or anything but when google couldn’t help, they have"
30-08-2019T15:15:22,SageSaga,yeah but they arent going to tell you if your account was compromised in this last attack
30-08-2019T15:16:16,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ll try asking my aunt when I get around her
30-08-2019T15:16:23,SpazztasticKiwi,they’re over from North Carolina
30-08-2019T15:17:58,SageSaga,any data collected hasnt been made public yet far as they know- but most likely you'll need to check on a site like haveibeenpwned
30-08-2019T15:18:31,SageSaga,all apple seems to know is that millions of devices have been compromised
30-08-2019T15:20:08,AnuSekaniArt,"Oh wow, haven't heard of that data breath"
30-08-2019T15:20:11,AnuSekaniArt,*breach
30-08-2019T15:21:24,SageSaga,years ago Apple had a guy message them about a flaw they found that could be used to upload malware onto their OS - their response to his warning was to ban his Apple Account
30-08-2019T15:22:36,AnuSekaniArt,Sounds like Apple
30-08-2019T15:24:08,SageSaga,companies like Microsoft will pay you for that kinda information- they call em bounties for hunting down bugs or exploits and letting them know
30-08-2019T15:25:02,AnuSekaniArt,Yeah. But it's Apple being Apple I suppose
30-08-2019T15:26:32,SageSaga,"i think his response was something like ""The only thing about this that bothers me besides it being a bad practice, Is I had all my music through Apple and now I cant access it"""
30-08-2019T15:27:05,AnuSekaniArt,Yikes
30-08-2019T15:27:20,AnuSekaniArt,Yeah I haven't owned an Apple product since 2014
30-08-2019T15:28:02,ZRO4825,"iPhone myself, rather like it to be honest. Got an iPod running around here somewhere too except I haven't been able to find since the last time I got forced to clean. Gee, go figure. And people wonder why I don't like to clean."
30-08-2019T15:28:10,AnuSekaniArt,Abs <32
30-08-2019T15:28:11,AnuSekaniArt,<3
30-08-2019T15:28:41,AnuSekaniArt,"And yeah to be fair, Android's given me issues such that I may decide to jump back"

30-08-2019T15:30:48,SageSaga,XD that reminds me of the iPhone updates that slow down older iPhones on purpose to help preserve their function

30-08-2019T15:36:11,SpazztasticKiwi,lady and her I guess husband are going to the bathrooms - next to the store back entrance for employees inside
30-08-2019T15:36:18,SpazztasticKiwi,man goes into men’s room
30-08-2019T15:36:27,RimaDraws,she followed?
30-08-2019T15:36:38,SpazztasticKiwi,"lady, seeing that I must be an employee, asked “where’s the ladies room?”"
30-08-2019T15:36:50,SageSaga,and fixed
30-08-2019T15:36:56,SpazztasticKiwi,right in front of the sign and doorless entrance

30-08-2019T15:38:25,TeapotOfDoom,i managed to ask if anyone has seen my phone while holding it in my hand
30-08-2019T15:38:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’ve been washing my hands once and a man wondered in, picking the wrong doorway"
30-08-2019T15:38:53,SpazztasticKiwi,“Is this the ladies room?”
30-08-2019T15:38:55,SpazztasticKiwi,he asks
30-08-2019T15:39:01,TeapotOfDoom,no
30-08-2019T15:39:24,TeapotOfDoom,I just come here on wednesdays
30-08-2019T15:39:25,RimaDraws,like no this is a unisex bathroom lol
30-08-2019T15:39:43,SpazztasticKiwi,there is a family restroom right across
30-08-2019T15:39:44,TeapotOfDoom,in sweden there were

30-08-2019T15:40:10,SpazztasticKiwi,"but again, all doorways have signs"
30-08-2019T15:40:14,FoxxTrotter,"I'ma heading out. Later, everyone. :0)"

30-08-2019T15:44:43,TeapotOfDoom,i've never tried either
30-08-2019T15:45:03,TeapotOfDoom,only thing i sometimes use is bixby for alarms but practically never
30-08-2019T15:45:23,SpazztasticKiwi,some apparently have trouble with Siri hearing them
30-08-2019T15:45:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Seán has issues with he going off when he says sorry
30-08-2019T15:45:55,SpazztasticKiwi,her
30-08-2019T15:47:09,SpazztasticKiwi,and you have to be careful around her cause an old update made it so you can tell her to call 911
30-08-2019T15:47:20,TeapotOfDoom,as a person who lives behind a vpn why would you have your phone have listen to you all the time?
30-08-2019T15:47:33,TeapotOfDoom,that was not english at all
30-08-2019T15:47:40,SpazztasticKiwi,you just can’t English today
30-08-2019T15:47:47,TeapotOfDoom,nein
30-08-2019T15:47:50,TeapotOfDoom,verdammt
30-08-2019T15:47:57,SpazztasticKiwi,language
30-08-2019T15:48:02,RimaDraws,lol
30-08-2019T15:48:11,TeapotOfDoom,yes wrong language
30-08-2019T15:48:23,TeapotOfDoom,i just said no. damnit
30-08-2019T15:48:37,TeapotOfDoom,i can get more vocal tho
30-08-2019T15:48:52,TeapotOfDoom,there are some really nice swearwords in my language
30-08-2019T15:49:13,SpazztasticKiwi,that reminds me someone pointed out something very poignant in Mark’s video last night
30-08-2019T15:49:33,TeapotOfDoom,the sour patch kids one?
30-08-2019T15:49:48,TeapotOfDoom,i dunno why but i really dig the series
30-08-2019T15:49:57,SpazztasticKiwi,"with him learning Korean and spending time in Korea to get better, soon he’ll be able to swear at games in two languages"
30-08-2019T15:49:58,TeapotOfDoom,also you got me into watching mark again
30-08-2019T15:50:13,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m sorry for your tragedy
30-08-2019T15:50:16,TeapotOfDoom,you mean like felix?
30-08-2019T15:50:45,TeapotOfDoom,i just rewatched most of the prop hunt series
30-08-2019T15:50:54,SpazztasticKiwi,though I’d say it may be three languages cause I’ve picked up him using German swears
30-08-2019T15:51:48,TeapotOfDoom,yeah but he doesn't speak german in the slightest. i mean he said it but even if he hadn't his pronounciation is wayyyy off
30-08-2019T15:51:53,SageSaga,he said his mother was going with him- which means the dogs might be an issue while we are playing our D&D game...
30-08-2019T15:52:15,SpazztasticKiwi,yeah toms alone and got all that to take care of himself for a month
30-08-2019T15:52:17,TeapotOfDoom,you mean tom will have to look after them?
30-08-2019T15:52:18,SpazztasticKiwi,plus work
30-08-2019T15:52:38,SageSaga,yeah they get whiny when shes not around for a while
30-08-2019T15:52:39,RimaDraws,ive watched pets worked and done school this last week
30-08-2019T15:52:45,RimaDraws,no not easy
30-08-2019T15:52:48,SpazztasticKiwi,God help him
30-08-2019T15:52:49,TeapotOfDoom,oh
30-08-2019T15:52:52,TeapotOfDoom,poor tom
30-08-2019T15:53:00,SpazztasticKiwi,he might go insane
30-08-2019T15:53:05,RimaDraws,they act up when their fave human is gone
30-08-2019T15:53:14,SpazztasticKiwi,we’re with him in spirit
30-08-2019T15:53:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I suggest earplugs
30-08-2019T15:53:31,RimaDraws,earplugs are good
30-08-2019T15:53:37,SpazztasticKiwi,or blare some heavy metal
30-08-2019T15:54:02,TeapotOfDoom,yo sage do you know if tom can speak some german? just curious
30-08-2019T15:54:17,SageSaga,"though last week - ""Tom? You went real quiet- you ok?"" ""My Cat is on my keyboard"""
30-08-2019T15:54:25,SageSaga,of course he can
30-08-2019T15:54:28,SpazztasticKiwi,KITTY
30-08-2019T15:54:38,TeapotOfDoom,"the ""blaring techno music"" from the stream a few weeks ago also works"
30-08-2019T15:54:54,TeapotOfDoom,he does?
30-08-2019T15:55:08,TeapotOfDoom,mark said he cant if i recall correctly
30-08-2019T15:55:09,SageSaga,almost everyone knows a little German
30-08-2019T15:55:20,RimaDraws,not me
30-08-2019T15:55:25,TeapotOfDoom,okok i really dunno what german you mean
30-08-2019T15:55:33,TeapotOfDoom,Ein Bier bitte does not count
30-08-2019T15:55:42,SpazztasticKiwi,no
30-08-2019T15:55:46,SpazztasticKiwi,no beer for you
30-08-2019T15:55:46,SageSaga,Rima- do you know what Nein means?
30-08-2019T15:55:53,RimaDraws,it means no
30-08-2019T15:55:57,TeapotOfDoom,NEINEINEINEIN
30-08-2019T15:55:58,SageSaga,you know some german
30-08-2019T15:55:58,SpazztasticKiwi,your typing is bad enough
30-08-2019T15:55:59,RimaDraws,but i dont know full blown german

30-08-2019T15:56:13,TeapotOfDoom,man i want some beer now
30-08-2019T15:56:17,TeapotOfDoom,damn
30-08-2019T15:56:20,RimaDraws,i dont
30-08-2019T15:56:30,SageSaga,"the question wasnt ""is he fluent"" it was ""does he know some"" and most people do!"
30-08-2019T15:56:32,RimaDraws,tastes like peroxide
30-08-2019T15:56:58,TeapotOfDoom,ok then i ask this: is anyone of the brothers conversational in the language?
30-08-2019T15:57:12,TeapotOfDoom,you have not had good beer then rima
30-08-2019T15:57:16,SageSaga,nope- but Mark did say he can speak some
30-08-2019T15:57:18,RimaDraws,i dont like beer
30-08-2019T15:57:25,TeapotOfDoom,although i have to say it mostly is an aquired taste
30-08-2019T15:57:29,SageSaga,I think Tom can do a bit but i think its been a long time
30-08-2019T15:57:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve heard Mark speak German
30-08-2019T15:57:44,TeapotOfDoom,really?
30-08-2019T15:57:49,TeapotOfDoom,when and where?
30-08-2019T15:57:50,SpazztasticKiwi,he’s ok but some of it’s off
30-08-2019T15:57:51,RimaDraws,in playthroughs it dont count
30-08-2019T15:58:04,SpazztasticKiwi,conversational wise though he’s lost
30-08-2019T15:58:25,SpazztasticKiwi,his pronunciation of Kaffee makes my eye twitch
30-08-2019T15:58:32,RimaDraws,pfft
30-08-2019T15:58:52,TeapotOfDoom,haha the best thing was steve from gamers nexus talking to german overclocker der8auer and the only thing he managed was to order a beer from him
30-08-2019T15:59:20,SageSaga,XD
30-08-2019T15:59:57,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’m happy with my progress cause watching this anime called Fruits Basket, there’s a German based character; the reboot has him using more German phrases"
30-08-2019T16:00:14,SpazztasticKiwi,and talking in German more in general than I remember
30-08-2019T16:00:20,SpazztasticKiwi,and I can actually understand him
30-08-2019T16:00:23,TeapotOfDoom,nice
30-08-2019T16:01:01,TeapotOfDoom,i wish you look should you ever come here tho. there are a lot of dialects and some aren't even understood by other german speaking people
30-08-2019T16:01:11,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s work time now
30-08-2019T16:01:15,TeapotOfDoom,i mean germany is easy mode
30-08-2019T16:01:22,SpazztasticKiwi,teapot go home you’re drunk
30-08-2019T16:02:15,TeapotOfDoom,i must say i am definitely not
30-08-2019T16:02:41,TeapotOfDoom,that would sound quite different
30-08-2019T16:03:18,TeapotOfDoom,also sage the light effects look really nice
30-08-2019T16:04:35,RimaDraws,your blur looks so good sage. how do you get it that smooth
30-08-2019T16:05:12,TeapotOfDoom,i have to say that looks quite convincing
30-08-2019T16:05:32,SageSaga,it's a finger tip blend- works like finger paint
30-08-2019T16:05:42,RimaDraws,ooh cool

30-08-2019T20:54:56,SomeNiceUser,I’m very excited for it.
30-08-2019T20:55:51,SpazztasticKiwi,managers son came by with his grandma
30-08-2019T20:56:06,SpazztasticKiwi,and immediately ran back behind the counter to his mom
30-08-2019T20:56:19,SpazztasticKiwi,everyone just about had a heart attack
30-08-2019T21:07:53,SomeNiceUser,Why you mean by that Kiwi?
30-08-2019T21:08:05,SomeNiceUser,What*
30-08-2019T21:19:13,SpazztasticKiwi,five year old small child back in the deli counter
30-08-2019T21:20:08,SomeNiceUser,It’s kinda funny and adorable.

30-08-2019T21:20:52,SpazztasticKiwi,and small child comes sprinting through it
30-08-2019T21:21:10,SomeNiceUser,Jesus.
