20-06-2019T14:02:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Adria weighs in around my weight
20-06-2019T14:02:26,SpazztasticKiwi,at just a few inches taller
20-06-2019T14:13:35,TerraTheWizard,well that answers that question for me of what's going on this weekend
20-06-2019T14:13:37,TerraTheWizard,lol
20-06-2019T14:20:56,SpazztasticKiwi,so fluffeh
20-06-2019T14:21:14,SpazztasticKiwi,imagine it’ll be the easiest ref to color
20-06-2019T15:29:47,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve finally gotten to the point where I don’t get current tv
20-06-2019T15:30:09,SpazztasticKiwi,The one playing at McDonald’s has got me a permanent wat face
20-06-2019T15:30:32,AspiringNoodle,I don't watch many shows to begin with :3
20-06-2019T15:30:48,FloofyCat,"This vote is really hard, there's so many good ones."
20-06-2019T15:30:58,AspiringNoodle,GO WITH THE FLOOF
20-06-2019T15:31:05,AspiringNoodle,Floof is NEVER the wrong answer :D
20-06-2019T15:31:29,FloofyCat,"Wha, Adira?"
20-06-2019T15:31:44,AspiringNoodle,And Maeve <3
20-06-2019T15:32:32,FloofyCat,"Okay, I'm usually not a big Adira fan, not that I dislike her or anything, just because I like others more. The ref sheet I can't deny I really wanna see that in colour."
20-06-2019T15:32:54,AspiringNoodle,"Vote for it, and you get 1 Maeve tail nom ^^"
20-06-2019T15:33:16,FloofyCat,"Smug Nibbly I really wanna see too, but I also want Feline for sale and New Supervisor."
20-06-2019T15:33:30,AspiringNoodle,This shall be the month of cats and Nibbs
20-06-2019T15:35:11,FloofyCat,I'm considering risking not voting for one of the Nora ones in the hopes everyone else gets it in the top 5 so I can give another one a chance.
20-06-2019T15:37:12,AspiringNoodle,I think it's safe to say that all nora kitty pics will get voted in xD
20-06-2019T15:37:48,AspiringNoodle,"Unless nobody votes for them because they know they're a popular pick and they want to give others a chance, at which point NOBODY votes for kitty Nora"
20-06-2019T15:38:09,AspiringNoodle,Am I confusing enough yet? :ptv-hearts:
20-06-2019T15:38:33,FloofyCat,"Nope, that's my other worry..."
20-06-2019T16:12:07,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m not sure I care much what gets picked
20-06-2019T16:13:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom’s probably having a time doing it and the con coming up. He’s been scarse as my cats at bath time these few days
20-06-2019T16:18:24,Bgrmystr2,"no that's kind of par for the course here, noodle"
20-06-2019T16:31:26,AspiringNoodle,Please tell me I'm not the only one who thinks this is weird:
20-06-2019T16:32:02,AspiringNoodle,"Is it weird for someone, who when they're thirsty, instead of grabbing something to drink and bringing it back with them, they will literally stand at the fridge, take a drink, and then put it back"
20-06-2019T16:32:10,AspiringNoodle,"Wash, rinse, repeat every time they're thirsty"
20-06-2019T16:37:59,Bgrmystr2,"hmmm, I guess it depends. I do both, but primarily due to size of what I'm drinking out of."
20-06-2019T16:38:20,AspiringNoodle,"In this case, it would be 16.9 fl oz bottles"
20-06-2019T16:39:13,Bgrmystr2,"well, I drink directly out of half gallon milk cartons from my fridge, but that's only cuz it's my fridge."
20-06-2019T16:39:34,Bgrmystr2,I don't do it if it's the primary fridge for the house
20-06-2019T16:45:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"if you live alone, there’s no one to complain"
20-06-2019T16:45:26,SpazztasticKiwi,“I licked it so it’s mine......who am I talking to?”
20-06-2019T16:46:04,Bgrmystr2,"Well that's not the case for me, but nonetheless."
20-06-2019T16:46:07,Bgrmystr2,my fridge is mine.
20-06-2019T16:46:58,SpazztasticKiwi,I happen to be the odd ball of the family and just about everything I like no one else will touch
20-06-2019T16:47:11,SpazztasticKiwi,👍🏻
20-06-2019T16:47:43,SpazztasticKiwi,work now
20-06-2019T16:47:44,Bgrmystr2,"How lucky, everything I would have in the kitchen the others will use BEFORE they use whatever they eat that I do not. At least one of them."
20-06-2019T16:48:00,Bgrmystr2,so I'm forced to have my own fridge just so I can have food and drinks for myself.
20-06-2019T16:48:42,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ll try continuing this when I go on break
20-06-2019T16:49:09,SpazztasticKiwi,just gotta keep telling myself it’s just 4 hours - I’ll live
20-06-2019T17:49:22,AspiringNoodle,"Feminist Frequency is ded, break out the fireworks early :smiley:"
20-06-2019T17:51:54,Bgrmystr2,the who what?
20-06-2019T17:53:07,AspiringNoodle,She's a dumbass who attacked video games for being sexist.
20-06-2019T17:53:20,AspiringNoodle,And then used cherry picking in EVERY SINGLE VIDEO to make her case.
20-06-2019T17:53:43,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: did she died?
20-06-2019T17:53:45,AspiringNoodle,"She claimed to be a ""gamer"" with an extensive ""collection"", but any real gamer knew she barely touched them at all :/"
20-06-2019T17:53:49,AspiringNoodle,"No, she went mega broke, lmao"
20-06-2019T17:54:08,Bgrmystr2,mkay..
20-06-2019T17:54:34,AspiringNoodle,"She tried dragging politics into video games, and used the most dishonest methods possible to make her argument seem legitimate"
20-06-2019T17:55:35,AspiringNoodle,"Oh, I should correct myself.  Feminist Frequency is a company / non-profit.  It was led by Anita Sarkeesian"
20-06-2019T17:55:46,AspiringNoodle,Anita is the lady everybody hated
20-06-2019T17:56:06,Bgrmystr2,"oh, I recognise that name"
20-06-2019T17:56:11,Bgrmystr2,you should have opened with that.
20-06-2019T17:56:16,AspiringNoodle,^^;
20-06-2019T17:56:26,Bgrmystr2,"She's a basket case, did she have a thing? Really? Anyone took her seriously?"
20-06-2019T17:56:35,AspiringNoodle,"She JUST tried attacking Cyberpunk 2077 for ""troubling"" representation issues :/"
20-06-2019T17:56:54,AspiringNoodle,"Yeah... that kinda backfired... and like the child she is, she's lashing out because she didn't get her way and her company is going the way of the dodo"
20-06-2019T17:57:25,AspiringNoodle,"We actually got financial reports from 2017 and 2018 that show, as they say, she got woke and went broke xD"
20-06-2019T17:57:34,Bgrmystr2,yeah when you're a selfish shit that doesn't know anything but me me me and attacks things that don't even affect her..
20-06-2019T17:57:48,Bgrmystr2,yeah she's just.. dumb.
20-06-2019T17:57:49,AspiringNoodle,"So in 2017, FF had ~$343k in the bank"
20-06-2019T17:57:55,Bgrmystr2,it was just a matter of time
20-06-2019T17:58:11,tehbear,i dont understand why people attacked her tho? couldnt they just choose to ignore her?
20-06-2019T17:58:12,AspiringNoodle,They raised roughly $250k and spent $460k
20-06-2019T17:58:43,AspiringNoodle,"They started the following year with ~$157k, raised $197k (lost 50k in corporate donos), and spent just about as much"
20-06-2019T17:58:54,AspiringNoodle,Ended that year with $30k in the bank
20-06-2019T17:59:07,AspiringNoodle,"She was a dishonest, sleezy grifter"
20-06-2019T17:59:36,AspiringNoodle,"She tried dragging video games into politics by quoting them as ""problematic"", then used intellectually dishonest methods to enhance her argument."
20-06-2019T17:59:51,AspiringNoodle,Particular going through the angle that video games are inherently sexist against women
20-06-2019T18:00:16,tehbear,all culture can be angled as problematic.
20-06-2019T18:00:31,AspiringNoodle,The reason we can't ignore her is because idiots like that can actually influence the people who make games
20-06-2019T18:00:42,Bgrmystr2,"oh, okay cuz the shirtless dudes being stupidly buff and manly wasn't sexist at all, hm? :V"
20-06-2019T18:00:45,AspiringNoodle,"And if they take her suggestions seriously, she in effect ruins the thing we love"
20-06-2019T18:00:50,Bgrmystr2,"Like I said, she's a fucking nutcase"
20-06-2019T18:01:08,TeapotOfDoom,Good meme though
20-06-2019T18:01:20,TeapotOfDoom,What have i just run into...
20-06-2019T18:01:24,AspiringNoodle,Can't wait to see how batshit crazy she goes as she begins the slide into irrelevancy
20-06-2019T18:01:34,Bgrmystr2,"she has zero knowledge of the subjects she talks about, it's not surprising the movement is gonna die off lol"
20-06-2019T18:01:55,AspiringNoodle,"If you ever want to see what kind of a joke she is, one of her videos talked about ""strategic butt coverings"""
20-06-2019T18:02:05,TeapotOfDoom,Wut?
20-06-2019T18:02:19,tehbear,"if i was a game developer, i would listen to my customers, not politicians or critics"
20-06-2019T18:02:21,AspiringNoodle,"Literally complaining that lady ass is out for all to see, but men always have some kind of strategically placed covering so you never get to see their glorious glutes"
20-06-2019T18:02:27,TeapotOfDoom,I cover my butt strategically using pants
20-06-2019T18:02:38,Bgrmystr2,Yeah Teapot same
20-06-2019T18:02:46,Bgrmystr2,"shorts, pants, they're called clothes"
20-06-2019T18:02:47,AspiringNoodle,"She used a batman game as her main argument, because his ass was ""always"" covered by his cape"
20-06-2019T18:02:56,Bgrmystr2,..or he wore pants?
20-06-2019T18:03:01,TeapotOfDoom,Oh no a cape
20-06-2019T18:03:04,AspiringNoodle,And the dumbass literally stood at the starting point of the first level of the game...
20-06-2019T18:03:16,AspiringNoodle,"Meanwhile, if you actually played the level for 30 fucking seconds, you'd get straight into combat"
20-06-2019T18:03:18,TeapotOfDoom,Edna already stated that they're bad
20-06-2019T18:03:35,AspiringNoodle,Which includes those GLORIOUS high kicks where his ass is presented front and center :)
20-06-2019T18:04:01,AspiringNoodle,"And that's literally how all her ""Tropes vs Women in Video Games"" videos went"
20-06-2019T18:04:12,AspiringNoodle,"She'd play a game, but cherry pick only the information that supported her argument"
20-06-2019T18:04:27,AspiringNoodle,"Oh no, Just Cause let's you murder lady strippers on this yacht"
20-06-2019T18:04:46,AspiringNoodle,"Whaaaaaaat, off screen there's male strippers who you can do the exact same stuff to?  Irrelevant..."
20-06-2019T18:04:54,tehbear,sounds as crazy as the evangelicals that say Harry Potter is the work of the devil since it contains sorcery
20-06-2019T18:04:55,TeapotOfDoom,I'm in an out guys. Going to bed. Night!
20-06-2019T18:05:04,Bgrmystr2,xD Gnight teapot
20-06-2019T18:05:07,AspiringNoodle,Night CoffeepotOfDoom :D
20-06-2019T18:05:34,TeapotOfDoom,I changed to tea. Otherwise sleeping would be a challenge
20-06-2019T18:05:59,AspiringNoodle,*slips coffeebeans into pot*
20-06-2019T18:06:18,TeapotOfDoom,starts to vibrate intensively
20-06-2019T18:06:27,tehbear,people have derided videogames ever since we could plot images on oscillioscopes
20-06-2019T18:06:59,AspiringNoodle,"Yeah, well, she's one of those new-age progressives who attacks everything that isn't strictly PC or inclusive"
20-06-2019T18:07:04,TeapotOfDoom,G'night!
20-06-2019T18:07:05,tehbear,Wolfenstein 3D was outlawed in Germany
20-06-2019T18:07:15,AspiringNoodle,And then won't hesitate to call you all the worst labels in the book if you DARE to disagree
20-06-2019T18:07:34,tehbear,games are art. and art shouldnt be cencored
20-06-2019T18:07:38,Bgrmystr2,I'd just call her even worsrer labels in the book because she's a fucking idiot
20-06-2019T18:08:29,AspiringNoodle,"To be honest, the first time anyone complains to me about lady armor in fantasy games being demeaning or objectifying, I will gladly point out that if they like ANY male character whose ripped, and only wears groin, shoulder, and foot protection"
20-06-2019T18:08:40,AspiringNoodle,", maybe gloves, they're guilty of the exact same thing."
20-06-2019T18:08:55,tehbear,"ok, i can kind of understand why people get mad. but it only puts fuel on the fire and money in this kind of peoples pocket who feed on controvercy. ignore the trolls."
20-06-2019T18:09:17,AspiringNoodle,"I'll be honest, I think the uproar worked :P"
20-06-2019T18:09:24,AspiringNoodle,Corporate donations tanked
20-06-2019T18:09:31,SpazztasticKiwi,none of you have any clue on the point of this argument if this is your response
20-06-2019T18:09:31,tehbear,good.
20-06-2019T18:09:35,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, female armor is pretty overdone, and overdone much more than males, but males get the buff end of the stick, so they're inaccurate as fuck as well."
20-06-2019T18:09:47,Bgrmystr2,eh. Two sides of the same coin.
20-06-2019T18:10:29,AspiringNoodle,Video game armor logic: https://i.chzbgr.com/full/8279889408/h24AC2545/
20-06-2019T18:10:35,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-laugh:
20-06-2019T18:11:06,Bgrmystr2,"there's so many things that debunk that image too, pity I don't have any of em on me. I just saw one recently too."
20-06-2019T18:11:19,AspiringNoodle,"Btw, loved Gears of War"
20-06-2019T18:11:21,Bgrmystr2,was reading a manga and saw it. was great xD
20-06-2019T18:11:23,tehbear,but i still think gamers really overreact when someone threatens their hobby. nobody is taking GTA5 away from you. Rock Star will still make GTA6 regardless.
20-06-2019T18:11:36,AspiringNoodle,Every man in that universe apparently takes gallons of steroids and works out nonstop xD
20-06-2019T18:12:00,AspiringNoodle,There are some studios that are going PC
20-06-2019T18:12:01,Bgrmystr2,"hard to say, bear. Games have been actually gutted due to bullshit from people complaining, the same people who would never play the game to begin with"
20-06-2019T18:12:06,AspiringNoodle,^
20-06-2019T18:12:16,Bgrmystr2,so gamers have every reason to tell em fuck right off
20-06-2019T18:12:21,AspiringNoodle,Dice destroyed some parts of Battlefield V to be politically correct / inclusive
20-06-2019T18:12:30,AspiringNoodle,Including historical revisionism
20-06-2019T18:13:15,AspiringNoodle,"Video game developers are legitimately listening to the loud minority making all the noise, because that's all they see"
20-06-2019T18:13:47,AspiringNoodle,"And if we don't fight back, the developers will make changes to our favorite games to appease the crowd who were never customers to begin with, never will be, meanwhile we're stuck with a ruined product"
20-06-2019T18:14:05,Bgrmystr2,and that's all the press sees because they only bother to look at the loudest people instead of looking at who's actually right.. like press is supposed to.
20-06-2019T18:14:13,Bgrmystr2,fuckin fail across the board
20-06-2019T18:14:18,tehbear,I still think its possible to have a civil discussion. The kind of harassment thats been done is completely pointless.
20-06-2019T18:14:26,AspiringNoodle,"Harassment, we don't condone"
20-06-2019T18:14:35,AspiringNoodle,Those people are idiots and only help those we hate
20-06-2019T18:14:45,Bgrmystr2,^ exactly
20-06-2019T18:14:46,tehbear,Mhm
20-06-2019T18:15:16,AspiringNoodle,"Mmmm, sushi~"
20-06-2019T18:15:34,tehbear,"PC-ness is everywhere. But I feel its a culture of holier than thou, rather than actually standing up for any values."
20-06-2019T18:15:42,AspiringNoodle,You're right
20-06-2019T18:15:47,Bgrmystr2,It's not exactly correct actually
20-06-2019T18:16:08,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
20-06-2019T18:16:09,Bgrmystr2,"there is a lot of value in PCs, but there's also a lot of value in consoles too."
20-06-2019T18:16:15,tehbear,:P
20-06-2019T18:16:18,AspiringNoodle,Smartass xD
20-06-2019T18:16:27,Bgrmystr2,"not at all, noodle xD"
20-06-2019T18:16:30,AspiringNoodle,Let me give you an idea of how Dice ruined Battlefield V
20-06-2019T18:17:14,Bgrmystr2,"Two sides of the same coin. PCs are much highly upgradable and can cater to all types of people, low to high income, any game at any funding"
20-06-2019T18:17:17,AspiringNoodle,Anyone who kept up with that shitshow knows how Blake Jorgensen is
20-06-2019T18:17:34,Bgrmystr2,but it takes longer to support so much hardware. Consoles are all one set of hardware for every console always.
20-06-2019T18:18:06,AspiringNoodle,And correct me if my ire is aimed at the wrong individual
20-06-2019T18:18:31,Bgrmystr2,"PC games can be objectively superior in many cases due to customizability, but inferior due to coding time and compatibility."
20-06-2019T18:18:35,AspiringNoodle,"...Wait, I mean Patrick Soderlund, who the hell is Blake Jorgensen xD"
20-06-2019T18:18:57,AspiringNoodle,"Patrick Soderlund (who was eventually let go, but not officially), infamously said this about BFV, ""If you don't like it, don't buy it"""
20-06-2019T18:19:09,tehbear,PCs and consoles have been converging for some time. Soon it might all be in the cloud with Stadia
20-06-2019T18:19:31,AspiringNoodle,He had some stupid sap story about a conversation with his daughter where she asked him why she can't play any ladies in Battlefield when she can play ladies in Fortnite
20-06-2019T18:19:40,Bgrmystr2,"I think it's a fair statement honestly, noodle. If someone doesn't like it, they vote with their wallet and don't buy it. It's legit."
20-06-2019T18:19:42,AspiringNoodle,"And he was like, ""That's a good point... let's change Battlefield V so you can play ladies"""
20-06-2019T18:19:49,Bgrmystr2,But yeah that's dumb.
20-06-2019T18:20:10,tehbear,hm. I would agree on Patrick Soderlund on that
20-06-2019T18:20:14,Bgrmystr2,a game about wars that didn't have girls on the front lines do not need girls on the front lines. It doesn't fuckin matter either way lol
20-06-2019T18:20:16,AspiringNoodle,"And that's when we get a trailer with a white woman with a prothestic arm, a black soldier with a katana, they're clearly fighting in the european theater..."
20-06-2019T18:20:35,tehbear,"Battlefield is just a game, its not a documentary film or history lesson"
20-06-2019T18:20:38,Bgrmystr2,"We can't play a male sorcerer on Diablo 2, did people bitch a fit? No, we're not retarded."
20-06-2019T18:20:42,AspiringNoodle,And then handicap lady makes a second appearance near the end of the trailer wearing blue face paint wielding a cricket bat wrapped in barbed wire -_-
20-06-2019T18:20:59,AspiringNoodle,Battlefield is based around historical accuracy
20-06-2019T18:21:10,Bgrmystr2,"Battlefield is advertised as putting you in a historical battle, yes actually."
20-06-2019T18:21:14,AspiringNoodle,And then they decide to throw that to the wind to satisfy the pc crowd and give fans the finger
20-06-2019T18:21:47,AspiringNoodle,"And here's what I mean about historical revisionism.  Supposedly in the game, there's a mission where polish soldiers infiltrate a german lab that was working on nuclear arms"
20-06-2019T18:21:55,tehbear,just dont play with girls: problem solved :P
20-06-2019T18:21:57,AspiringNoodle,"Historically, the mission was done by 2 polish men who got the job done"
20-06-2019T18:22:05,Bgrmystr2,that's not really the problem though
20-06-2019T18:22:10,AspiringNoodle,"In the game, the men failed so they send in 2 female soldiers to get it done right..."
20-06-2019T18:22:36,Bgrmystr2,"I don't think it actually matters if there's guys or girls in the game, but they can't just advertise it as something, then give you something different."
20-06-2019T18:22:51,Bgrmystr2,the idea that it's not supposed to be historically accurate is bullshit
20-06-2019T18:22:59,Bgrmystr2,always has been.
20-06-2019T18:23:16,AspiringNoodle,"Dice is dead to me.  I've been a fan of the Battlefield games for a long time, have a few in my backlog.  But I'm not getting V.  VI either if they keep it up :/"
20-06-2019T18:23:21,Bgrmystr2,"Be accurate to history, or don't advertise it as a historic game. Pick one."
20-06-2019T18:23:28,tehbear,agreed
20-06-2019T18:23:49,AspiringNoodle,There was actually a game that flopped recently.  But mostly because it was a bad game
20-06-2019T18:24:07,AspiringNoodle,"The game would take place in hell, and you'd be facing demons with all their glorious naughty bits on display"
20-06-2019T18:24:19,Bgrmystr2,"I'm down for that, gemmy"
20-06-2019T18:24:31,AspiringNoodle,But then the PC douchebags caused an uproar and got the developer to censor the lady demons
20-06-2019T18:24:31,Bgrmystr2,is it like Doom? lol
20-06-2019T18:24:32,tehbear,"but i dont think the Battlefield games were every very serious. Its supposed to be fun, not a simualation. War isnt fun or balanced like a game is."
20-06-2019T18:24:43,AspiringNoodle,Meanwhile the male demons are still uncensored
20-06-2019T18:24:49,AspiringNoodle,"yeah, that makes fucking sense"
20-06-2019T18:25:06,AspiringNoodle,Give us dolls for female demons and weiners flopping in our faces for males
20-06-2019T18:25:11,Bgrmystr2,Yeah I'm not surprised the game died
20-06-2019T18:25:22,AspiringNoodle,"Meh, it was a mediocre game"
20-06-2019T18:25:29,AspiringNoodle,It just hurt itself by self-censoring
20-06-2019T18:25:33,tehbear,It would be more serious if Total war or some serious historical game started fooling with history.
20-06-2019T18:25:45,AspiringNoodle,And this is the problem
20-06-2019T18:25:56,Bgrmystr2,"Honestly, it's not any different in the face of the public for advertising purposes"
20-06-2019T18:26:03,AspiringNoodle,"The new-age PC Evangelicals are causing uproars over ""offensive"" elements of video games, demanding developers change them"
20-06-2019T18:26:08,Bgrmystr2,they're representing the game incorrectly for what they show
20-06-2019T18:26:09,AspiringNoodle,But they don't even play the games themselves
20-06-2019T18:26:57,AspiringNoodle,If you think about it like this: How pissed would you be if Vegans caused uproar at every single dining establishment you like because they use animal products?
20-06-2019T18:27:06,AspiringNoodle,And all the meat and good stuff got removed.
20-06-2019T18:27:22,AspiringNoodle,"But they don't even dine there, and then the restaurants had to close because they lost their business."
20-06-2019T18:27:37,tehbear,"ultimately, vote with your wallet"
20-06-2019T18:27:49,tehbear,if you dont like what the game developers do. dont buy the game.
20-06-2019T18:27:50,AspiringNoodle,"bear, that's what I'm trying to say"
20-06-2019T18:27:55,AspiringNoodle,What do you do if they ruin EVERYTHING
20-06-2019T18:27:59,AspiringNoodle,Who the hell do you go to
20-06-2019T18:28:03,tehbear,make your own game
20-06-2019T18:28:18,AspiringNoodle,That's a very poor argument...
20-06-2019T18:28:20,tehbear,or play the old ones you like again
20-06-2019T18:28:30,AspiringNoodle,"More reasonable, but still a poor argument"
20-06-2019T18:28:40,Bgrmystr2,Imo we wouldn't have to vote with our wallet if games didn't kowtow to people who don't even play it.
20-06-2019T18:28:45,AspiringNoodle,^
20-06-2019T18:28:50,AspiringNoodle,And THAT is why we fight back.
20-06-2019T18:29:06,AspiringNoodle,We aren't gonna let some rowdy douchebags ruin OUR thing when they're just fucking posers looking in from the outside
20-06-2019T18:29:12,Bgrmystr2,"games are for a certain set of people, cater to THEM. Not others."
20-06-2019T18:29:30,Bgrmystr2,every game has a different set of people they cater to.
20-06-2019T18:29:47,Bgrmystr2,trying to please everyone is suicide
20-06-2019T18:29:54,Bgrmystr2,but noone seems to understand this.
20-06-2019T18:30:06,AspiringNoodle,"These people hold the mindset of, ""Everything must not be offensive to me.  If I don't enjoy, nobody can.  Change or die."""
20-06-2019T18:30:15,tehbear,everyone wants to be a fortnite clone
20-06-2019T18:31:10,CrRAR,hooowheeee
20-06-2019T18:31:14,CrRAR,it'sa friday

20-06-2019T18:31:41,CrRAR,*[FRIDERARALARRARR]
20-06-2019T18:31:52,Xexanoth,"i'm just gonna appreciate the irony of you calling other people rowdy douchebags who ruin games, when you just finished bitching about the whole ""ermagerd woman and black people in battlefield 1""...."
20-06-2019T18:32:35,AspiringNoodle,It wasn't inherently that
20-06-2019T18:33:04,AspiringNoodle,"It was more about the fact that the lady was a frontline soldier with a prosthetic limb, who later showed up in the trailer with blue facepaint and a barb-wire wrapped cricket back"
20-06-2019T18:33:24,AspiringNoodle,"And my complaint with the black lad was the fact that he had a katana, and they were in the european theater"
20-06-2019T18:33:36,Xexanoth,"so? it's fucking battlefield, it's the ""fun multiplayer war shooter"""
20-06-2019T18:33:40,AspiringNoodle,cricket bat*
20-06-2019T18:33:57,AspiringNoodle,...I thought we just had a discussion about historical accuracy
20-06-2019T18:34:23,Bgrmystr2,"It's called advertising and representation, Xex. You seem to be missing that. It's okay, the game is missing that too."
20-06-2019T18:34:43,Bgrmystr2,"This irony, too, is musubi. :)"
20-06-2019T18:35:01,Xexanoth,"battlefield was never about historical accuracy, if you wanna complain about stuff like ""a katana being at the wrong theatre of war"" then complaiun about all the other stuff, like tanks being in theatre that they never where in, or guns that don't work"
20-06-2019T18:35:04,Xexanoth,like in real life
20-06-2019T18:35:09,tehbear,^
20-06-2019T18:35:51,AspiringNoodle,Fair point
20-06-2019T18:35:51,Bgrmystr2,Then you've probably never bothered to take a proper objective look at how they tote the game
20-06-2019T18:36:10,AspiringNoodle,"At which point, we should also point out that tank battles in Battlefield are absolutely ludicrous xD"
20-06-2019T18:36:13,Bgrmystr2,"Yeah it ain't perfect, and those are problems too"
20-06-2019T18:36:42,AspiringNoodle,World of Tanks is as close as you can get to accurate tank battles
20-06-2019T18:36:43,tehbear,"ultimately, its a commercial product that has to make $"
20-06-2019T18:36:55,tehbear,its not a peer reviewed history lesson
20-06-2019T18:36:56,AspiringNoodle,"But even then, it's hilarious inaccurate!"
20-06-2019T18:36:59,Xexanoth,"the thing is, if you use stuff like a katana or woman with a prostetic as breaking your historical accuracy, then you're just as cherry picking your example to be a douchebag..."
20-06-2019T18:37:40,Bgrmystr2,"not really, xex. If anything, you're saying that those two should be ignored for other things the game includes"
20-06-2019T18:37:50,Bgrmystr2,"and that's not true, it should all be evaluated"
20-06-2019T18:38:05,tehbear,"Most media is inaccurate. Either to accentuate something, make more action or just because the creators didnt do enough research."
20-06-2019T18:38:15,AspiringNoodle,I'll say that we're both right in different regards
20-06-2019T18:38:16,Xexanoth,"i'm saying, either you complain about ALL of it, or you don't complain about any of it...."
20-06-2019T18:38:31,tehbear,"Chernobyl tv series has many factual issues, but its still a good tv series"
20-06-2019T18:38:55,Xexanoth,but battelfield is a game where everytime you do literally anything you get 5 different screen popups with medals and points and shit that any argument about historical accuracy is laughable anyways....
20-06-2019T18:39:10,tehbear,There is an essence of truthyness to it. And it made a lot of people curious enough to do some research
20-06-2019T18:39:10,AspiringNoodle,"Xex is right in that it is a tad silly for me to criticize inaccuracies, but only pick a handful"
20-06-2019T18:39:31,Bgrmystr2,"Yeah there's a reason I never got into any of the military shooters. Historical, realistic, or otherwise. They're full of shit."
20-06-2019T18:39:34,AspiringNoodle,I'm right in that the prosthetic lady and black soldier with katana break the immersion more easily
20-06-2019T18:39:56,Bgrmystr2,"They're still inaccuracies, but there's way more. a lot more"
20-06-2019T18:40:07,AspiringNoodle,"But since that wasn't my original argument, I don't know what fallacy I'm pulling at the moment"
20-06-2019T18:40:38,Bgrmystr2,"xD there's been a lot of fallacy. You never said that was the ONLY problem with the game, just that it was a problem."
20-06-2019T18:41:17,AspiringNoodle,I wonder if they have that one infamous LMG in BFV...
20-06-2019T18:41:33,AspiringNoodle,There was an LMG with a 40 round clip (iirc) that had problems with feeding its ammo
20-06-2019T18:41:36,Xexanoth,my issue was just you criticising other people while pulling the same kind of silly argument yourself....
20-06-2019T18:42:02,AspiringNoodle,That could be an argument in and of itself
20-06-2019T18:42:27,Bgrmystr2,"that's not really true, xex. Everything we talked about had reasoning behind it. You can't just say we're attacking things that we don't understand. That's actual horseshit, xex."
20-06-2019T18:42:31,Bgrmystr2,Please do not.
20-06-2019T18:42:36,Xexanoth,"aye, i just always think: it's a video game, it's made for fun, just put in as much stuff as possible so everyone can choose whatever they want..."
20-06-2019T18:42:39,AspiringNoodle,"If you criticize inaccuracies, should you go full technical, or is it fair to point out only blatant fallacious material?"
20-06-2019T18:43:15,tehbear,+1 Xexanoth. Playing Battlefield is no replacement for reading a history book
20-06-2019T18:43:47,Bgrmystr2,"It's totally fair to point out individual problems, noodle, despite xex's statements to the contrary. It is, however, important to note that there are many more issues than just the ones spoken."
20-06-2019T18:44:03,AspiringNoodle,"I want to say our argument was ""Battlefield represents itself as a historically accurate shooter, but then had trailers with blatantly INACCURATE materal, that even normal, non-versed people could point out."""
20-06-2019T18:44:05,tehbear,"While I dont like misrepresentation of history, one has to accept games are the very definition of entertainent, and must be fun."
20-06-2019T18:44:06,Bgrmystr2,and it's important to not ignore them
20-06-2019T18:44:17,AspiringNoodle,"But it's been going on for a while, so I can't be sure anymore."
20-06-2019T18:45:01,Bgrmystr2,"games do not have to be fun, it's supposed to cater to and grow your mind, bear lol"
20-06-2019T18:45:17,Bgrmystr2,"most games are made to be fun, sure, but lots of em are educational or just make you think"
20-06-2019T18:45:28,Bgrmystr2,"having fun is a side-effect, it's not the primary focus"
20-06-2019T18:45:40,Bgrmystr2,"but if you're not enjoying it, then it's already failed"
20-06-2019T18:45:48,tehbear,I dont think an FPS is made to make you think. Its made to make you quickly reflex and shoot someone
20-06-2019T18:46:11,tehbear,WW1 is just the backdrop
20-06-2019T18:46:11,AspiringNoodle,I would like to point out that Battlefield: Bad Company 2 was my favorite Battlefield for a long time
20-06-2019T18:46:16,Bgrmystr2,"it gives you quicker thinking reflexes, reaction times, etc"
20-06-2019T18:46:37,AspiringNoodle,But I always pointed out the ludicrousness of you being able to fire a .50 sniper rifle standing up and not break your shoulder or fall flat on your ass :ptv-laugh:
20-06-2019T18:46:56,Bgrmystr2,yeah that's just silly
20-06-2019T18:47:06,AspiringNoodle,Especially when you can knock down trees with it :P
20-06-2019T18:47:15,AspiringNoodle,"Got more than a few kills by shooting through trees, but always found it silly"
20-06-2019T18:47:23,Bgrmystr2,and not knock your shoulder out of it's socket with the kickback lol
20-06-2019T18:49:02,AspiringNoodle,"I guess I should point out, if Battlefield V REALLY wanted to include female soldiers, and not go to ridiculous lengths, they could've included the Russian sniper squads"
20-06-2019T18:49:11,AspiringNoodle,Those ladies were scary
20-06-2019T18:49:29,tehbear,"yeah, they could represent all sexes and colours, but also realistically."
20-06-2019T18:49:42,tehbear,i guess its just more work
20-06-2019T18:49:57,AspiringNoodle,Now I'm glad Xex came in
20-06-2019T18:50:04,AspiringNoodle,He grabbed the leash xD
20-06-2019T18:50:14,Bgrmystr2,I have no leash.
20-06-2019T18:50:21,AspiringNoodle,*pulls out tranq gun*
20-06-2019T18:50:21,Bgrmystr2,come at me :ptv-snicker::ptv-ohmy:
20-06-2019T18:50:24,Xexanoth,You stole the leash!
20-06-2019T18:50:25,tehbear,"easier to tweak the existing 3d mesh and textures to fit existing, and plonk it into the game"
20-06-2019T18:50:26,AspiringNoodle,"We gonna have a problem, boi?"
20-06-2019T18:50:31,Xexanoth,goddamit Marisa
20-06-2019T18:50:40,Bgrmystr2,tehe~
20-06-2019T18:50:57,Bgrmystr2,"your tranqs have no power on me, noodle :V"
20-06-2019T18:51:47,AspiringNoodle,I'ma finish my sushi
20-06-2019T18:52:02,AspiringNoodle,Then maybe we can talk about game journalists losing their minds over the Modern Warfare remake xD
20-06-2019T18:52:39,tehbear,I only played CoD MW 4 on Ps3
20-06-2019T18:53:31,tehbear,The helicopter nightvision scene was a chilling example of how easy it must feel to kill people that are just dots on a CRT screen
20-06-2019T18:53:39,tehbear,Just like a video game!
20-06-2019T18:54:08,AspiringNoodle,"Okay, so I want to bring this up, forget sushi"
20-06-2019T18:54:18,AspiringNoodle,"So a big complaint about the remake is that it's ""too real"""
20-06-2019T18:54:59,tehbear,death race from 1976 was too realistic at the time
20-06-2019T18:55:10,AspiringNoodle,"Apparently there are some things that happen in real life that are so verboten, that you can't include them in games"
20-06-2019T18:55:40,tehbear,there is a limit for what you can get away with.
20-06-2019T18:55:47,Bgrmystr2,"what, no, bear"
20-06-2019T18:55:50,Bgrmystr2,that movie was awesome
20-06-2019T18:56:03,AspiringNoodle,"So, the problem deals with some of the antagonists"
20-06-2019T18:56:10,tehbear,i was thinking of the game death race :P
20-06-2019T18:56:26,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
20-06-2019T18:56:27,tehbear,it was modeled on the movie tho. but very primitive gfx
20-06-2019T18:56:41,AspiringNoodle,"When discussing what to do with a young girl, one soldier recommends bringing her to the captain, because he, and I quote, ""Likes them young..."""
20-06-2019T18:57:03,Bgrmystr2,it's an arcade game.. and it was realistic? hoho
20-06-2019T18:57:16,AspiringNoodle,"To me, this seems like the ""No Russian"" controversy all over again."
20-06-2019T18:58:47,AspiringNoodle,*crickets*
20-06-2019T18:59:03,AspiringNoodle,"Oh no, things got awkward"

20-06-2019T18:59:25,AspiringNoodle,"Well, what's your take on the journalist outrage?"
20-06-2019T19:00:14,AspiringNoodle,"Mine is that while the whole scenario is indeed offensive, it is pushing the boundaries by presenting the player with a real-world attrocity that happens more than we'd like to think."
20-06-2019T19:00:14,tehbear,i was reading the wiki article on No Russian
20-06-2019T19:00:43,AspiringNoodle,Do you think the No Russian controversy was overblown?
20-06-2019T19:01:06,tehbear,"in retrospect, its easy to say yes. We keep pushing the boundries for whats acceptable."
20-06-2019T19:01:37,Xexanoth,"eh, it's the exact same advertismenet shit as usual, someone does something slightly controversial, someone else goes ""oh no"". and then everyone else picks up the outrage from the few people who are ""outraged"""
20-06-2019T19:02:00,tehbear,news isnt gonna write itself!
20-06-2019T19:02:30,AspiringNoodle,My reasoning for why No Russian wasn't controversial is because it set up a major plot point to the story
20-06-2019T19:02:51,AspiringNoodle,"It never presented itself as acceptable, and you could opt to not shoot anyone."
20-06-2019T19:03:22,AspiringNoodle,Not to mention the leader ends up killing your character to frame your nation and start another world war :/
20-06-2019T19:03:58,AspiringNoodle,Further driving home just how messed up that whole scenario was
20-06-2019T19:04:08,tehbear,i think thats clever storytelling in a game
20-06-2019T19:04:11,tehbear,give the player choices. the more the better!
20-06-2019T19:04:31,AspiringNoodle,"Yeah, in the game, it doesn't matter if you shoot the civilians or not"
20-06-2019T19:05:01,AspiringNoodle,"Doesn't matter if you shoot the armed responders, either.  You die in any scenario.  Nikolai knew you were a mole the whole time, which is WHY he went through with it"
20-06-2019T19:06:16,AspiringNoodle,"Which is why I think the outrage over the implied unpleasantness in MW remake is overblown, too.  It's not like they presenting it as, ""Hey, this is totally acceptable and not at all illegal!"""
20-06-2019T19:06:40,AspiringNoodle,It's meant to drive home how criminal these men are and to piss you off for when you [probably] end up killing them yourself.
20-06-2019T19:07:48,AspiringNoodle,I ramble too much
20-06-2019T19:07:51,tehbear,its ok
20-06-2019T19:08:12,tehbear,im tired. going to sleep
20-06-2019T19:08:17,AspiringNoodle,But... stream
20-06-2019T19:08:19,AspiringNoodle,In hour D:
20-06-2019T19:08:56,tehbear,"its an interesting discussion tho. i think other mediums such as books, comics and film can currently get away with much more than video games"
20-06-2019T19:09:15,AspiringNoodle,Probably because they're older media
20-06-2019T19:09:27,AspiringNoodle,Video games are the new kid on the block and the new kid ALWAYS takes the heat.
20-06-2019T19:09:41,tehbear,partly because video games are so immersive. and... there are certain acts you just dont want to act out. its better to have them hinted at or narriated.
20-06-2019T19:11:29,AspiringNoodle,"I hold the position that as long as games never present something questionable as acceptable, they should be in the clear."
20-06-2019T19:12:23,tehbear,"mhm. dont make violence porn just for the sake of it. however, its difficult to do much else if all you have is a gun"
20-06-2019T19:12:45,AspiringNoodle,There's one game in my backlog that I want to play eventually
20-06-2019T19:12:47,tehbear,im interested to see if VR and AR games will break out of the mold of FPSs
20-06-2019T19:12:54,AspiringNoodle,Spec Ops: The Line.  Apparently that game is BRILLIANT
20-06-2019T19:13:20,Dadrobit,Howdy y'all.
20-06-2019T19:13:27,AspiringNoodle,"Not only pokes fun at common video game mechanics / plots, but also digs into the moral questions surrounding war."

20-06-2019T19:13:40,Dadrobit,SO:TL was an incredible game.
20-06-2019T19:14:01,AspiringNoodle,I love the premise
20-06-2019T19:14:18,AspiringNoodle,"Every other game more or less says, ""You're a good guy, here's a gun, go out there and kill for your country!"""
20-06-2019T19:14:31,AspiringNoodle,"Spec Ops be like, ""...But are you really?"""
20-06-2019T19:14:35,Dadrobit,It legitimately made me sick to my stomach at one point in the game. Had to put down the controller and walk away.
20-06-2019T19:15:29,AspiringNoodle,"Tbh, it's a perfect entry since it came during a time when war shooters were THE thing"
20-06-2019T19:15:38,AspiringNoodle,Multiple franchises releasing a new entry every year
20-06-2019T19:15:51,AspiringNoodle,"And then BAM, Spec Ops comes out swinging, asking the big questions!"

20-06-2019T21:03:11,SageSaga,mostly doing it with your friends and it being unpredictable to a point that made it different almost every time

20-06-2019T23:02:22,iliar,About Nora's Daki. It seems to me human Nora not very popular. I think I will not lie if I say that it is I who force human Nora. And I don't like daki.
20-06-2019T23:02:23,CrRAR,okay
20-06-2019T23:02:25,LEgGOdt1,Okay
20-06-2019T23:02:30,Ordithus,hi Purp
20-06-2019T23:02:30,iliar,I think Cat Nora is much more popular. Therefore it seems to me Cat Nora Daki more likely.

20-06-2019T23:04:11,iliar,I think the tail is not a problem. Much more problem with the wings.
20-06-2019T23:04:12,Ordithus,a few months ago it was fox all the people

20-06-2019T23:14:13,SageSaga,i watch almost all the Isekais- terrible and decent
20-06-2019T23:14:41,MatyMaty,This one looks... weird? it is somehow an harem one but the mom is the main character?
20-06-2019T23:14:45,SageSaga,I watched all of In Another World With My Cell Phone- that was awful
20-06-2019T23:14:50,LannAF,"I saw the trailer, looked cute"
20-06-2019T23:14:54,LannAF,might watch with sticky
20-06-2019T23:15:27,SageSaga,i think it will be funny to have his OP mom getting in the way of or maybe even pushing for her son to have a harem
20-06-2019T23:15:30,SageSaga,both will be funny
20-06-2019T23:15:42,MatyMaty,"picking a right bride, lol"
20-06-2019T23:15:47,LannAF,or the mom obtaining a harem
20-06-2019T23:15:48,FloofyCat,I wonder if she is actually heavy.

20-06-2019T23:17:20,Combak,I wonder if there is a show based on the MC's parent being in a harem anime...
20-06-2019T23:18:07,SageSaga,they have one where a guy is reincarnated into a hotspring in a fantasy world
20-06-2019T23:18:36,CrRAR,wow
20-06-2019T23:18:39,LannAF,...
20-06-2019T23:18:51,happyguyone,I would like to see an anime about two people form different social classes that end up falling in love with each other despite objections and hardships.

20-06-2019T23:19:17,LannAF,there's plenty of those I think
20-06-2019T23:19:31,AspiringNoodle,"Though it's more of a harem comedy, but it does have social conflict elements."
20-06-2019T23:21:04,mingun,09:15
20-06-2019T23:21:22,AspiringNoodle,"I swear, Nora wants trace all the more knowing that he's not interested"

20-06-2019T23:22:44,MatyMaty,Neko!
20-06-2019T23:23:08,CrRAR,He just has to do a few magic tricks and she'd be smitten.

20-06-2019T23:25:08,MatyMaty,I imagine part of why she likes Trace is so much is because he doesn't fall for her
20-06-2019T23:25:26,MatyMaty,If he was all smitted I doubt she would be as interested :P
20-06-2019T23:25:30,LannAF,I imagine it's because of his huge
