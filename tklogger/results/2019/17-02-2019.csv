17-02-2019T00:03:16,SpazztasticKiwi,News. I just started Mark’s latest Monday member stream
17-02-2019T00:03:43,SpazztasticKiwi,He’s gonna get his wisdom teeth removed sometime. Cause apparently he needs to
17-02-2019T00:06:03,Ordithus,Hasn't this been a topic lately
17-02-2019T00:12:59,RimaDraws,its not so bad once they're out
17-02-2019T00:13:21,RimaDraws,i only have one left to get out and its not hurting me now
17-02-2019T00:13:41,Ordithus,I had mine removed ages ago
17-02-2019T00:15:34,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s what he hit on. Cause Ethan had his removed.
17-02-2019T00:16:00,SpazztasticKiwi,And he also mentioned that he should’ve gotten it done ages ago
17-02-2019T00:16:23,SpazztasticKiwi,I had to get mine cut out at 18/19
17-02-2019T00:17:14,RimaDraws,mine didnt fully develop till my early 20s
17-02-2019T00:17:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"And here he is with them still at 28, apparently growing backwards"
17-02-2019T00:17:25,Ordithus,I'm 30 and should probably get braces :ctwokinds-nataniAAAAshake:
17-02-2019T00:17:32,RimaDraws,i do too ord
17-02-2019T00:17:44,SpazztasticKiwi,I really hope he gets out ok
17-02-2019T00:17:44,RimaDraws,but i may get them soon
17-02-2019T00:17:53,RimaDraws,he will be fine
17-02-2019T00:17:56,RimaDraws,its not so bad.
17-02-2019T00:18:20,RimaDraws,i had cavities in my top two you dont know how much better i felt without the constant throbbing
17-02-2019T00:18:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I had all my teeth fixing young. Still got a lower tooth out of line but I’ll live
17-02-2019T00:18:57,SpazztasticKiwi,I still don’t particularly like my smile though. Still don’t look white enough
17-02-2019T00:19:07,RimaDraws,oh girl dont feel bad
17-02-2019T00:19:13,RimaDraws,mine arent perfect either
17-02-2019T00:21:33,RimaDraws,i was scared going in to get them done but i literally hyperventilated myself to sleep
17-02-2019T00:21:37,RimaDraws,lol
17-02-2019T00:21:45,RimaDraws,first time i had the first one taken out
17-02-2019T00:22:03,Ordithus,I had them knock me out.  All 4 in one go.
17-02-2019T00:22:20,RimaDraws,it took 45 mins to get it out because the root was curved. top two second time took 20 mins and i felt no pain on both surgeries. didnt even need the meds
17-02-2019T00:22:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Yep. They were just barely showing but they still had to be cut out of the gums
17-02-2019T00:23:01,RimaDraws,like i said mine developed late
17-02-2019T00:23:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Otherwise they’d keep growing into my backmost 4 they were next to and crack them
17-02-2019T00:28:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"Tom, if you ain’t busy - how’d yours go"
17-02-2019T00:31:28,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
17-02-2019T00:31:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh and I guess I’ll mention I’m playing with some clay crafty molding

17-02-2019T14:42:53,Mippy,Maybe
17-02-2019T14:43:01,CrimsonQuill,Then you're right.
17-02-2019T14:43:12,CrimsonQuill,But the primary reason is it's just a damn good comic.
17-02-2019T14:43:39,CrimsonQuill,Everyone has a favourite character and/or character crush.

17-02-2019T17:28:38,TerraTheWizard,so are we universe A or universe 1?
17-02-2019T17:29:20,ThingsAreMoving,yes
17-02-2019T17:29:28,ShadowSoap,We are just one among possibly an infinite amount of universes
17-02-2019T17:29:36,ShadowSoap,Can't really label them
17-02-2019T17:29:59,Dadrobit,I hereby label this universe: Markus.
17-02-2019T17:30:18,ThingsAreMoving,I like Markus.
17-02-2019T17:30:25,ThingsAreMoving,has a viking vibe to it
17-02-2019T17:30:53,ShadowSoap,Better than what any scientist would call it.
17-02-2019T17:31:07,ShadowSoap,They would assign some random string of numbers and letters
17-02-2019T17:31:09,Dadrobit,"Ah man, speaking of vikings. Anyone watched the second season of Castlevania yet?"
17-02-2019T17:31:13,ShadowSoap,That nobody could memorize.

17-02-2019T17:31:36,ThingsAreMoving,It was stretched too much imho
17-02-2019T17:31:53,ShadowSoap,"Possibly, Things. That is fair"
17-02-2019T17:32:07,Dadrobit,Ended up watching it last night instead of the Neo Yokio Christmas Special.

17-02-2019T17:32:51,ThingsAreMoving,"Not for long, hopefully"
17-02-2019T17:33:31,Dadrobit,Watching it will surely enrich my life.

17-02-2019T17:34:34,Dadrobit,It really is
17-02-2019T17:34:50,ShadowSoap,There are different subsets of American culture.
17-02-2019T17:34:59,ShadowSoap,The Rich are certainly different than the Poor
17-02-2019T17:35:18,ShadowSoap,And the hillbillies are different from the gangsters
17-02-2019T17:35:22,Dadrobit,"I'm part of the ""Grew up at the dead end of a dirt road next to a drug house"" subset."

17-02-2019T17:46:09,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Thanks for the update Tom
17-02-2019T17:46:20,ThingsAreMoving,1am for me...
17-02-2019T17:46:24,Mippy,Sounds good Tom.
17-02-2019T17:46:26,unsteddyphoenix,"Ah, dang."
17-02-2019T17:46:28,MarvTheHugPharaoh,5 pm for me
17-02-2019T17:46:29,ThingsAreMoving,welp 1 hour stream is better than nostream
17-02-2019T17:46:34,unsteddyphoenix,"Oh well, thanks for lettin' us know~"
17-02-2019T17:46:37,ThingsAreMoving,Bgr will be happy.
17-02-2019T17:46:40,Combak,"Oh, hey Tom!"
17-02-2019T17:46:40,unsteddyphoenix,I can still watch a bit
17-02-2019T17:46:45,Combak,Good to hear then!
17-02-2019T17:46:46,Dadrobit,Rabbit needed a full engine rebuild. Thing was seized to hell and back and had been sitting in the back of the junkyard for 20 years. The day I got T-Boned in that thing was damn near favorable.
17-02-2019T17:46:46,CrRAR,Oh good
17-02-2019T17:47:08,ThingsAreMoving,We'll pass the info
17-02-2019T17:47:45,TorqueEmUp,"heh, mine already was on it's 2nd engine, and I swapped two different engine for more POWAH! in the time I had it."
17-02-2019T17:47:50,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I require sustenance
17-02-2019T17:48:36,ThingsAreMoving,get some nutrition up in your huggable bod
17-02-2019T17:48:40,TorqueEmUp,"first I swapped in a 1.6 SOHC, and that gave me about 20HP over the stock 1.3. Then Swapped in a 1.8 DOHC that was double the HP of the 1.3"
17-02-2019T17:49:05,Dadrobit,"The original plan for mine was to get it running off of cooking oil for ""free"" gas. Never got around to doing the conversion though."
17-02-2019T17:49:16,TorqueEmUp,130HP in a car that weighs less than a ton.
17-02-2019T17:49:32,TorqueEmUp,and still gets high 30s in MPG
17-02-2019T17:49:43,Mippy,be back later... gotta go talk to mom
17-02-2019T17:50:31,TorqueEmUp,"Well 130-140, never dyno'd it, and HP ratings for that Engine varied a bit depending on application."
17-02-2019T17:50:54,iliar,"Tom, about Power-line adapter. As I expected, reality is very different from advertising. In reality 1 Gbps turned into 30-50 Mbps."
17-02-2019T17:51:44,Twokinds,not too surprising
17-02-2019T17:52:52,iliar,This is better than nothing. But I expected more.
17-02-2019T17:53:28,ThingsAreMoving,I'm using powerline adapters to distribute the internet downstairs. It's enough to watch full HD netflix on two separate devices at the same time
17-02-2019T17:55:24,Twokinds,Probably better to just get a 100m cable
17-02-2019T17:55:59,ThingsAreMoving,"Are you in need of internet in an outside shed, or what?"
17-02-2019T17:57:23,Twokinds,Basement
17-02-2019T17:58:13,ThingsAreMoving,do you have concrete flooring between your basement and ground floor?
17-02-2019T17:58:57,Twokinds,Yes
17-02-2019T17:59:12,TorqueEmUp,"Bummer, so no drilling holes in the floor. =/"
17-02-2019T17:59:13,ThingsAreMoving,bummer. Cable is your best option
17-02-2019T18:00:08,iliar,Of course quality Ethernet cable cat. 5e/6 much better than Power-line adapter. The only reason I decided to try them was that I had already made repairs and laid another cable is very expensive.
17-02-2019T18:01:26,TorqueEmUp,I'd be willing to bet those power-line adapters probably also are effected by the quality of the wiring.
17-02-2019T18:02:22,ThingsAreMoving,"Not as much as the first iterations of the tech, but yeah. Lots of stuff can have massive impact on link quality."
17-02-2019T18:02:53,ShadowSoap,Back everyone! Hello Tom!
17-02-2019T18:02:56,TorqueEmUp,"And judging by Tom's issues with house electrical issues in the past, probably not going to work very well."
17-02-2019T18:03:46,TorqueEmUp,"Then again I am no electrical engineer, and don't really understand how the powerline adapters work. lol"
17-02-2019T18:06:18,ThingsAreMoving,"Best way would be to check if they're good enough and if they're not, return them to the shop."
17-02-2019T18:06:27,ThingsAreMoving,But I have no idea if you can do that in the US

17-02-2019T19:12:48,ThorburnCreative,"Most weeks yes, this week sadly no"
17-02-2019T19:19:16,SpazztasticKiwi,8 est means it’s 9 for me

17-02-2019T20:00:38,ShadowSoap,Just change your browsers default autocorrect language

17-02-2019T21:22:50,Bgrmystr2,so they likely don't have the money to support multiple layers of quality for each stream

17-02-2019T21:23:38,Bgrmystr2,Twitch has to render each resolution live at the same time
17-02-2019T21:23:39,Twokinds,I don't know
17-02-2019T21:24:32,Eternity1,ok
17-02-2019T21:24:55,ThorburnCreative,picarto tends to throttle frame rate if anything - I've seen it drop to ~3 fps in really bad cases.
17-02-2019T21:25:29,Xexanoth,makes sense
17-02-2019T21:25:43,Xexanoth,"since it's art, quality is more important than framerate"
17-02-2019T21:25:55,Bgrmystr2,"also, I've found that if you right click the video and click ""show controls"" you can see how far back the video is, and can potentially catch the stream up."
17-02-2019T21:26:05,Bgrmystr2,if yours is super behind
17-02-2019T21:26:35,Apostrophe,"I've been wondeing, what is the audio bitrate on Picarto? I sometimes play stream music through my living room stereo and it sounds a little compressed at times."
17-02-2019T21:26:46,Bgrmystr2,they can have some pretty high bitrate
17-02-2019T21:26:52,MviluUatusun,"Well, time for bed.  I'll see y'all later."
17-02-2019T21:26:54,Ordithus,It depends on Tom's side too

17-02-2019T21:27:13,Ordithus,"Tom plays the music off youtube, yes?"
17-02-2019T21:27:24,Combak,Yep
17-02-2019T21:27:27,Bgrmystr2,"the audio compression is from the user's stream settings, not picarto."
17-02-2019T21:27:29,Apostrophe,"Youtube audio can be kind of compressed itself, although it's gotten a lot better"
17-02-2019T21:27:54,Bgrmystr2,"picarto doesn't compress it usually. If it sounds compressed, it's cuz of the stream software settings."

17-02-2019T23:18:49,Dimensional,"Yeah... I can agree the stream is slow, but I thought it was just me, tbh."
17-02-2019T23:19:19,BadFoMo,Adria: Aw. They're sleeping. (sees book near Kathrin's hand.) Adria: Huh? That doesn't look like one of our books. (Adria examens said book.) Adria: Ah! What is this?! (Is one of Eric's books.)
17-02-2019T23:19:20,Bgrmystr2,"lol dimen, lots of people have been talking about how delayed the stream is. it's one of the servers."
17-02-2019T23:19:25,MuonNeutrino,well for me it's just cause my internet sucks
