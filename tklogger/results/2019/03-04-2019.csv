03-04-2019T01:36:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Hopefully it goes better than mine

03-04-2019T09:50:33,iliar,"Good morning, Tom."
03-04-2019T09:54:44,Twokinds,Mornin'
03-04-2019T09:58:30,Azumachan,"Howdy, how everybody is doing ?"
03-04-2019T10:13:50,iliar,"I was thinking. You often say ""anyone can become an artist."" And I understand why you say this to novice artists. The only way to learn how to do something is to practice more."
03-04-2019T10:14:01,iliar,"But I do not agree with the fact that ""anyone can become an artist."" For example, I can not draw. I mean ""absolutely can not draw."" Even this http://twokinds.gallery/files/Twokinds_2019.03.30.jpg is an extremely high level for me."
03-04-2019T10:14:09,iliar,"I tried to practice more. He came after work, sat down at the table and for many hours tried to draw circles, squares, boxes and other simple figures. Without any progress."
03-04-2019T10:14:23,iliar,"I think the fact is that for me drawing is a hard, tedious job. When I write a program, I can enjoy the process. Even if I fail."
03-04-2019T10:14:30,iliar,"I think this is exactly what is needed in order to become an artist. You must love to draw. I'm sure you drew your old works because you wanted to draw something, not because ""I have to draw 10,000 sketches to enhance my skill."""
03-04-2019T10:21:33,Twokinds,"Yeah, I suppose that's true."
03-04-2019T10:22:00,Twokinds,Getting good at something does require having the drive to put in the effort.
03-04-2019T10:40:44,Twokinds,That applies to anything. I can't learn a foreign language because I lack the drive to dedicate myself to it.
03-04-2019T10:44:45,Azumachan,10 000 hours of practice to be an expert in a subject
03-04-2019T10:45:41,iliar,"About language. I wonder your opinion. In Russian, we usually use different words when talking about humans gender and animals gender. What do you think, which option is more correct when we talk about Keidran?"
03-04-2019T10:46:05,iliar,Would it be better to use human terms or animals?
03-04-2019T10:47:26,Azumachan,You're updating the wiki Iliar ?
03-04-2019T10:48:09,iliar,Not. I'm too lazy to do this.
03-04-2019T10:53:04,Azumachan,"88 for japanese, 12 to 24 for any roman languages."
03-04-2019T10:53:16,Azumachan,oops
03-04-2019T10:53:20,Azumachan,"For Russian you need a 34 weeks course to be good at it, 88 for japanese, 12 to 24 for any roman languages"
03-04-2019T10:57:01,Twokinds,I don't know
03-04-2019T10:57:15,Twokinds,It would depend on the context. I don't know what animal terms means.
03-04-2019T10:57:20,Twokinds,Maybe animal?
03-04-2019T10:57:29,Twokinds,No clue.
03-04-2019T10:57:51,Twokinds,I took 1 semester of Japanese in college and retained NONE of it. :\
03-04-2019T10:58:41,Azumachan,"Mmm, in japanese you have different way to address a kind of animal."
03-04-2019T10:59:04,Azumachan,you don't use the same pronoun for a dog/cat or a bird

03-04-2019T11:01:09,Azumachan,Great one Tom.
03-04-2019T11:04:55,iliar,"I'm not sure that this is the right analogue. But for example when we talk about humans we use ""female"", but we usually not say female cat or female dog. We use something like doe/dam/jenny."

03-04-2019T11:21:14,iliar,My question is not about the rules of the Russian language. How to think about Keidran.
03-04-2019T11:21:15,iliar,"In one case, will be more emphasized on their human side. In other case will be more emphasized on their animal side"
03-04-2019T12:02:47,Twokinds,I do like the emphasize that they aren't human.
03-04-2019T12:03:29,iliar,Okay. It makes sense.
