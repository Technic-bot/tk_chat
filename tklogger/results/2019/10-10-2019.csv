10-10-2019T20:27:44,ContagiousBordem16,Dis a color stream
10-10-2019T20:27:52,ContagiousBordem16,?
10-10-2019T20:27:56,unsteddyphoenix,When did you get so smooth
10-10-2019T20:27:58,unsteddyphoenix,Not allowed
10-10-2019T20:28:21,ContagiousBordem16,Or is it a page stream
10-10-2019T20:28:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Smoothness comes from me running on 3 hours of sleep
10-10-2019T20:28:27,ContagiousBordem16,Or both
10-10-2019T20:28:29,FloofyCat,Nah it's a page stream but Nora cards instead
10-10-2019T20:28:38,FloofyCat,"So um, both kinda."
10-10-2019T20:28:40,ContagiousBordem16,Cri

10-10-2019T20:29:10,ContagiousBordem16,Page redux
10-10-2019T20:29:51,FloofyCat,Well this was part of a page.
10-10-2019T20:30:02,FloofyCat,So it's a colour page stream Nora card of a page.
10-10-2019T20:31:21,unsteddyphoenix,Technically the truth
10-10-2019T20:31:32,Orthonox,Ah Nora Cards! Sweet! Glad someone (probably Azumachan) sponsored this sketch.
10-10-2019T20:31:56,ContagiousBordem16,Hopefully I come back for the page
10-10-2019T20:31:59,unsteddyphoenix,Solid bet
10-10-2019T20:32:22,MoonDance,I like seeing redraws of old pieces. It can really show how far an artist has gotten to imporve
10-10-2019T20:33:02,MoonDance,But not constant though. One here and there never hurts the originality
10-10-2019T20:33:39,steelabjur,Am I the only one who thinks Flora looks a bit like Kat without her stripes?
10-10-2019T20:33:40,BadFoMo,Back.
10-10-2019T20:34:03,MoonDance,Door frame is through Keith's ear
10-10-2019T20:34:12,Twokinds,I am aware
10-10-2019T20:34:20,unsteddyphoenix,Kat is way prettier dont be ridiculous :ctwokinds-redrose:
10-10-2019T20:34:32,BadFoMo,"Man, that is a /thin/ pizza."
10-10-2019T20:34:53,ZRO4825,"cracker style thing crust, easy to accomplish~"
10-10-2019T20:34:58,ZRO4825,thin*
10-10-2019T20:35:02,Orthonox,"I do not see it, Steel. All I can say is that she looks more naked without stripes."
10-10-2019T20:37:14,SpazztasticKiwi,sup nerds
10-10-2019T20:37:56,Sclimshady,Hi Kiwi :cw0lfmare-Paperembercool:
10-10-2019T20:37:58,AnuSekaniArt,Eyyy Kiwi!
10-10-2019T20:38:04,FloofyCat,Kat and Flora's hair is very different.
10-10-2019T20:38:08,unsteddyphoenix,Hey!
10-10-2019T20:38:25,AnuSekaniArt,"Ye, but both are cute ladies regardless ^^"
10-10-2019T20:38:37,unsteddyphoenix,"I will say, Floras wearing a Kat-ish expression right now"
10-10-2019T20:38:50,unsteddyphoenix,So maybe thats where he got the impression
10-10-2019T20:39:21,monbai,hi
10-10-2019T20:39:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Red looks like the room suddenly got very warm for him
10-10-2019T20:39:46,steelabjur,"Yeah, the face is what's throwing me."
10-10-2019T20:40:35,BadFoMo,Hmm... Sketch Request; Red as Carrot Top (Dialing down the center?). Yes or No?
10-10-2019T20:41:12,BadFoMo,...Maybe that joke worked better in my mine.
10-10-2019T20:41:20,BadFoMo,*mind
10-10-2019T20:41:23,Sclimshady,"I have never even seen a carrot top act,  so I wouldnt know"
10-10-2019T20:41:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Red tries bleaching his hair so everyone stops calling him red - it turns pink instead
10-10-2019T20:42:04,SpazztasticKiwi,"or it doesn’t change at all, whichever’s funnier"
10-10-2019T20:42:15,steelabjur,I saw a smaller version of the video in the email and was thinking someone requested Kat as Sleeping Beauty with her various shipping partners in the back looking on.
10-10-2019T20:42:26,CrRAR,Then just call him Lightish-red
10-10-2019T20:42:38,SpazztasticKiwi,call him Salmon

10-10-2019T22:01:08,Dadrobit,Halloween is alright I s'pose. Kinda interrupts my work a lot. Gotta turn a bunch of folks away from getting in my gate to go door to door. Makes a lot of kids sad.
10-10-2019T22:01:29,HoverdudeXL,Yea thats one thing
10-10-2019T22:01:29,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-LauraCry: that is sad
10-10-2019T22:01:53,HoverdudeXL,Plus all the people
10-10-2019T22:01:59,Dadrobit,"On the flip side, the actual residents tend to go all out on their decorations/costumes, so that's cool at least for me."
10-10-2019T22:02:59,HoverdudeXL,Is this the only sketch tom is going to do taday

10-10-2019T22:07:56,Dadrobit,We don't want to encorage behavior in the unwashed masses that makes them think that they're welcome.
10-10-2019T22:08:04,CrimsonHelsing,"we can hand out candy, but trick or treaters don't come around our block"

10-10-2019T23:57:09,RimaDraws,"i had one on the top left, top right, and two on the bottom right. so i got four doses of numbing medicine in the designated spots"

10-10-2019T23:57:56,RimaDraws,the left side was already worn down on the medicine while my right side was still a bit strongly numbed. so when i sipped in the left side my right side just went PFFF

10-10-2019T23:59:48,SageSaga,1 - they didnt give me enough local anesthetic so i felt them cut into me and it took me a while to be able to signal to them that i was in pain
