17-07-2019T08:50:24,AspiringNoodle,"Mmmm, love sleeping all through the night~"
17-07-2019T08:50:33,AspiringNoodle,I wonder if I've lost weight yet
17-07-2019T08:53:05,Dadrobit,"Yeah, the ice cream idiot is kinda old news at this point. The bright side isn't necessarily just that she's been arrested, it's that more foodstuffs will hopefully start implementing more anti-tamper/tamper-evident barriers/"
17-07-2019T08:53:54,Dadrobit,"Because she sure as Hell wasn't/isn't the first person stupid enough to pull that shit, she was just the dumbest one in making it public."
17-07-2019T08:54:25,Dadrobit,So maybe this pushes manufacturers into keeping their foodstuffs more safe.
17-07-2019T08:58:40,AspiringNoodle,It's obvious what this is going to lead to
17-07-2019T08:58:45,AspiringNoodle,Plastic seals around the lids
17-07-2019T08:58:56,AspiringNoodle,As well as a 3% price increase :P
17-07-2019T08:59:33,AspiringNoodle,"However, the bigger problem is the morons who are going to one up this shit"
17-07-2019T08:59:44,AspiringNoodle,One lady was arrested for filming her son licking things in a doctor's office
17-07-2019T10:28:03,CrimsonQuill,Good afternoon everyone.

17-07-2019T10:48:31,AspiringNoodle,"Oh dear God, why did I ever stop watching Gumball???"

17-07-2019T10:50:10,AspiringNoodle,"For context, apparently the two protagonists are taking over for ""Larry"" for a short while"
17-07-2019T10:50:24,AspiringNoodle,A gag character in the show who basically holds all the worst jobs in town at the exact same time
17-07-2019T10:50:54,AspiringNoodle,"They had an episode where he ""quit"", and the town went to shite, because that's how many jobs he had xD"
17-07-2019T10:54:32,CrimsonQuill,No thanks
17-07-2019T10:54:36,CrimsonQuill,Not my style
17-07-2019T10:56:52,AspiringNoodle,"Oh come on, there's some gold in there xD"
17-07-2019T10:57:29,AspiringNoodle,"I appreciate when ""kids"" shows poke fun at adult problems :P"
17-07-2019T11:00:08,CrimsonQuill,I'm afraid that the aesthetics really puts me off of it.

17-07-2019T11:06:22,CrimsonQuill,I note that this one seems to be ultra-sized.

17-07-2019T11:12:02,AspiringNoodle,"Creepy thought, I wonder if  Saria has a closet somewhere full of Rose-fur coats"
17-07-2019T11:12:29,CrimsonQuill,Naaah...I'm willing to bet it was just binned.
17-07-2019T11:18:00,AspiringNoodle,Now I'm curious
17-07-2019T11:18:20,AspiringNoodle,"Would a full-body brushing to get rid of shed fur feel more like a haircut, or a massage?"
17-07-2019T11:18:41,Orthonox,Massage.
17-07-2019T11:21:59,AspiringNoodle,"I imagine that's why we have the ""It wasn't"" note ;)"
17-07-2019T11:22:03,AspiringNoodle,Feels too good
17-07-2019T11:22:19,AspiringNoodle,Worth it to put up with Saria's teasing xD

17-07-2019T15:32:11,SpazztasticKiwi,yeah like I said he just seemed like he was ready to jump on the ball

17-07-2019T15:33:22,Bgrmystr2,"it's entirely possible that it was ""go time"" due to perhaps his first customer"
17-07-2019T15:33:34,Bgrmystr2,who knows
17-07-2019T15:33:35,AspiringNoodle,Entirely possible

17-07-2019T15:34:59,Bgrmystr2,"but you automatically assumed the worst, noodle"
17-07-2019T15:35:08,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs nice to see someone excited to work. Often times they‚Äôre nervous to be yelled at for messing up
17-07-2019T15:35:20,AspiringNoodle,*shrugs shoulders*
17-07-2019T15:35:30,CrimsonQuill,I do not understand...what's the conversation?
17-07-2019T15:35:31,AspiringNoodle,"When information is missing, people naturally make assumptions"
17-07-2019T15:35:35,AspiringNoodle,"Stop human shaming me, bruh"

17-07-2019T15:36:18,AspiringNoodle,For I am but a humble noodle
17-07-2019T15:36:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I was gonna type in the park with my mini picnic
17-07-2019T15:36:26,SpazztasticKiwi,guess who forgot the laptop

17-07-2019T15:37:45,CrimsonQuill,@SpazztasticKiwi makes sense I suppose...
17-07-2019T15:38:19,Bgrmystr2,but you can read what's going on now and construe some semblance

17-07-2019T15:40:14,Bgrmystr2,well MSRP is what you expect as of right now
17-07-2019T15:40:19,Bgrmystr2,it just released
17-07-2019T15:40:44,CrimsonQuill,I am in a state of mild euphoria at present.
17-07-2019T15:40:47,SpazztasticKiwi,oh y‚Äôall know my cousin posted on fb she might be going to court
17-07-2019T15:40:50,CrimsonQuill,Because I drew something
17-07-2019T15:41:08,SpazztasticKiwi,a neighbors two little dogs were left loose and attacked her
17-07-2019T15:41:19,CrimsonQuill,Ouch
17-07-2019T15:41:25,SpazztasticKiwi,this isn‚Äôt the first time they‚Äôve harassed someone either
17-07-2019T15:42:10,SpazztasticKiwi,even worse she‚Äôs having to wait for rabies and shots report. But it doesn‚Äôt look like they‚Äôre gonna be up to date
17-07-2019T15:43:01,CrimsonQuill,"Well, I hope she'll be ok."
17-07-2019T15:43:33,SpazztasticKiwi,she should be. It was a few bites in the calf but the jeans caught most of it
17-07-2019T15:43:45,CrimsonQuill,"Good, tough denim."
17-07-2019T15:43:46,SpazztasticKiwi,she‚Äôs just not looking forward to any shots
17-07-2019T15:44:14,CrimsonQuill,I'm pretty ok with injections...as long as they're over soon.
17-07-2019T15:44:37,SpazztasticKiwi,yeah but these will be rabies
17-07-2019T15:44:44,CrimsonQuill,Ah.
17-07-2019T15:44:56,CrimsonQuill,Umm
17-07-2019T15:44:58,CrimsonQuill,Nasty?
17-07-2019T15:45:06,SpazztasticKiwi,they‚Äôre supposed to be a series thing
17-07-2019T15:45:25,SpazztasticKiwi,similar to the cervical cancer vaccines
17-07-2019T15:45:49,CrimsonQuill,I don't really know what those mean...
17-07-2019T15:45:57,SpazztasticKiwi,you go in every other week or something and they hurt or they go in the stomach. I‚Äôve heard many things
17-07-2019T15:46:07,CrimsonQuill,"Ouch, I see."
17-07-2019T15:46:21,SpazztasticKiwi,by know it may just be a little boop in the arm and you‚Äôre done
17-07-2019T15:46:27,SpazztasticKiwi,now
17-07-2019T15:46:35,CrimsonQuill,....
17-07-2019T15:46:37,CrimsonQuill,Ok
17-07-2019T15:46:41,CrimsonQuill,I think I see now
17-07-2019T15:47:16,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm focusing on not getting bit by anything where that kind of mess is needed
17-07-2019T15:47:21,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs worked so far
17-07-2019T15:47:30,CrimsonQuill,:)
17-07-2019T15:47:40,CrimsonQuill,I'm not really outside so much...
17-07-2019T15:47:47,CrimsonQuill,Study (it sucks)
17-07-2019T15:47:48,CrimsonQuill,And drawing
17-07-2019T15:47:56,CrimsonQuill,I had a euphoria yesterday
17-07-2019T15:47:58,SpazztasticKiwi,better than the heat
17-07-2019T15:48:09,SpazztasticKiwi,that‚Äôs a ‚Äúepiphany‚Äù
17-07-2019T15:48:13,CrimsonQuill,I finished a drawing I'd been working on for over a week....
17-07-2019T15:48:23,CrimsonQuill,"And no, it was definitely a euphoria."
17-07-2019T15:48:35,CrimsonQuill,Euphoria is that intense joy.
17-07-2019T15:49:10,CrimsonQuill,But I'd been doing an art trade on Deviantart with another user.
17-07-2019T15:49:13,CrimsonQuill,I made the picture...
17-07-2019T15:49:26,CrimsonQuill,"But I rushed it to the end, and felt like I'd bodged it."
17-07-2019T15:49:32,CrimsonQuill,So I decided to redraw it....
17-07-2019T15:49:39,CrimsonQuill,It took me over a week...but I did it.
17-07-2019T15:49:54,CrimsonQuill,And not only that...I decided to put in a bit of TK fanart.
17-07-2019T15:50:26,CrimsonQuill,Ummm....if you like I could whisper a link?
17-07-2019T15:50:52,CrimsonQuill,@SpazztasticKiwi
17-07-2019T15:50:57,SpazztasticKiwi,if you‚Äôd want
17-07-2019T15:51:04,CrimsonQuill,"Okay, here I go"
17-07-2019T15:52:02,SpazztasticKiwi,rough
17-07-2019T15:52:23,SpazztasticKiwi,digitally you could make those colors thic
17-07-2019T15:52:45,CrimsonQuill,"Yeah, well, I don't have the resources"
17-07-2019T15:52:50,CrimsonQuill,Just a sketchbook and pencils
17-07-2019T15:53:02,SpazztasticKiwi,prismacolor
17-07-2019T15:53:06,CrimsonQuill,So...whadya think of the revision?
17-07-2019T15:53:31,SpazztasticKiwi,they do color pens and boy are they some thic colors
17-07-2019T15:53:35,CrimsonQuill,(These were both drawn on A4 By the way-the scanner just scans them really big
17-07-2019T15:53:49,SpazztasticKiwi,I did something with them once and it came out looking like matte paint
17-07-2019T15:53:51,CrimsonQuill,Prismacolor pens..I might give them a go when I'm better at colouring
17-07-2019T15:53:53,SpazztasticKiwi,they‚Äôre not bad
17-07-2019T15:54:06,SpazztasticKiwi,They‚Äôre just a wee bit expensive
17-07-2019T15:54:15,CrimsonQuill,OK
17-07-2019T15:54:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I have a suitcase package and a smaller 14 count
17-07-2019T15:54:28,CrimsonQuill,I see
17-07-2019T15:54:36,CrimsonQuill,"So, comparison between the two"
17-07-2019T15:54:43,CrimsonQuill,Any thoughts?
17-07-2019T15:54:46,SpazztasticKiwi,but the color is beautiful
17-07-2019T15:54:51,CrimsonQuill,:)
17-07-2019T15:54:53,SpazztasticKiwi,"like I said, neither is bad"
17-07-2019T15:55:24,CrimsonQuill,I'm actually removing the first one from my gallery because I am a bit embarrased by it...
17-07-2019T15:55:32,CrimsonQuill,I'm really proud of the revision though.
17-07-2019T15:55:40,SpazztasticKiwi,they‚Äôre just slightly rough with the color like a first draft is
17-07-2019T15:55:53,CrimsonQuill,Especially the fact that I was able to draw Raine with any degree of justics...
17-07-2019T15:55:56,CrimsonQuill,justice
17-07-2019T15:55:57,SpazztasticKiwi,I should have a shot of the prismacolor drawing
17-07-2019T15:56:05,CrimsonQuill,"Yeah, the colour is sketchy"
17-07-2019T15:56:11,CrimsonQuill,I have Crayola pencils
17-07-2019T15:56:24,CrimsonQuill,"I'm trying to get a feel for how to blend the colours, how to use them"
17-07-2019T15:57:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/524825976597643265/601517786103021588/image0.jpg 2017, keep in mind. The milestone is old"
17-07-2019T15:57:32,CrimsonQuill,I put Raine in Air Assault class Mjolnir. Suits her. My OC Bailey is in a hodge-podge of armour
17-07-2019T15:57:49,CrimsonQuill,Oh crumbs that is cool
17-07-2019T15:58:22,CrimsonQuill,I'm actually hoping to link this to Tom as a sort of fanart thingy when he pops down
17-07-2019T15:58:29,CrimsonQuill,I wonder if it'd count
17-07-2019T15:58:53,SpazztasticKiwi,SDCC is till 19th or somethin
17-07-2019T15:59:01,SpazztasticKiwi,then he‚Äôs gotta fly home
17-07-2019T15:59:02,CrimsonQuill,"Heh, tomorrow then"
17-07-2019T15:59:17,SpazztasticKiwi,because I doubt he drove all the way to San Fran
17-07-2019T15:59:19,CrimsonQuill,And on Saturday is the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11
17-07-2019T15:59:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Diego
17-07-2019T15:59:33,CrimsonQuill,Tomorrow is a big day for me
17-07-2019T15:59:38,SpazztasticKiwi,too many San in California
17-07-2019T15:59:41,CrimsonQuill,I have exam timetables coming in
17-07-2019T15:59:47,CrimsonQuill,I want to meet him at SDCC
17-07-2019T15:59:51,CrimsonQuill,But...
17-07-2019T15:59:57,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôd like to visit SDCC
17-07-2019T16:00:01,SpazztasticKiwi,but
17-07-2019T16:00:06,CrimsonQuill,Even taking a plane to NYC and then going to the city by train...
17-07-2019T16:00:09,SpazztasticKiwi,people
17-07-2019T16:00:15,SpazztasticKiwi,and California
17-07-2019T16:00:22,CrimsonQuill,It'd be over $1000 in travel costs alone
17-07-2019T16:00:37,SpazztasticKiwi,tell you what the pictures from VidCon had me very tempted to hop on a plane
17-07-2019T16:00:41,CrimsonQuill,"And then I'd have to pay for food, a place to stay...."
17-07-2019T16:00:42,SpazztasticKiwi,They had a ball pit
17-07-2019T16:00:51,CrimsonQuill,"Plus, HUGE CROWDS"
17-07-2019T16:00:58,CrimsonQuill,I am a bit nervous around them
17-07-2019T16:01:27,SpazztasticKiwi,"and VidCon had Thomas Sanders, Ethan, Se√°n, Rosanna, Dan and Phil, Jenna"
17-07-2019T16:02:05,CrimsonQuill,S√©an as in S√©an McGloughlin?
17-07-2019T16:02:21,SpazztasticKiwi,obviously
17-07-2019T16:02:26,CrimsonQuill,Thought so
17-07-2019T16:02:33,CrimsonQuill,I want to meet him
17-07-2019T16:02:47,CrimsonQuill,His 'Missed Messages' video saved my life
17-07-2019T16:02:52,SpazztasticKiwi,"they just missed PhillyD, Mark, Ken, & Felix"
17-07-2019T16:03:00,SpazztasticKiwi,otherwise it was hold
17-07-2019T16:03:04,SpazztasticKiwi,gold
17-07-2019T16:03:21,SpazztasticKiwi,"And Tom, but I can‚Äôt see him going to something like VidCon"
17-07-2019T16:03:37,SpazztasticKiwi,I met Se√°n already last year
17-07-2019T16:03:58,TeapotOfDoom,Good evening peeps

17-07-2019T16:04:13,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôd be nice if Sanders and most of the others went to PAX

17-07-2019T16:05:38,SpazztasticKiwi,and of course he‚Äôs been to America now
17-07-2019T16:05:49,CrimsonQuill,I saw his vlogs
17-07-2019T16:06:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Germany & Sweden and a bucketful of other places on tour
17-07-2019T16:06:24,SpazztasticKiwi,and he‚Äôs not even 30 yet

17-07-2019T16:07:13,CrimsonQuill,I see Spazz
17-07-2019T16:08:30,SpazztasticKiwi,it surprised me in some of Marks Germany things I could read what he was butchering
17-07-2019T16:08:41,SpazztasticKiwi,sorta like ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not how you say it‚Äù
17-07-2019T16:08:52,CrimsonQuill,I wouldn't know
17-07-2019T16:08:56,CrimsonQuill,I didn't see those
17-07-2019T16:09:17,SpazztasticKiwi,it was instagram
17-07-2019T16:09:36,CrimsonQuill,Oh ok
17-07-2019T16:09:59,SpazztasticKiwi,some bits may have been videos but their main concern was Ethan‚Äôs allergy and how the reading thing was an issue there
17-07-2019T16:11:24,CrimsonQuill,@TeapotOfDoom one week of drawing
17-07-2019T16:12:06,TeapotOfDoom,"You're pretty determined, aren't you? It's a pretty hefty jump tbh"
17-07-2019T16:12:39,TeapotOfDoom,Also i love english people butchering german stuff
17-07-2019T16:12:45,CrimsonQuill,"@TeapotOfDoom Well, I was just embarrased by the first one."
17-07-2019T16:13:01,CrimsonQuill,I could butcher any language
17-07-2019T16:13:05,CrimsonQuill,English included
17-07-2019T16:13:12,CrimsonQuill,I butcher accents all the time
17-07-2019T16:13:16,TeapotOfDoom,Don't be. Everyone starts at one point
17-07-2019T16:13:49,CrimsonQuill,"@TeapotOfDoom the thing was, those drawings were drawn within days of each other"
17-07-2019T16:13:55,CrimsonQuill,I just rushed the first one
17-07-2019T16:14:00,TeapotOfDoom,"Also if you don't think your past work is not the best you could do now, you haven't improved"
17-07-2019T16:14:37,CrimsonQuill,@TeapotOfDoom that passed work was a bodge job of rush...I knew I could have done better...so I just redid it...
17-07-2019T16:14:51,TeapotOfDoom,"To quote Vader, most impressive"
17-07-2019T16:14:52,CrimsonQuill,@SpazztasticKiwi you going to Pax this year?

17-07-2019T16:16:01,TeapotOfDoom,I still have to practice chinese today :ctwokinds-keifacepalm:
17-07-2019T16:16:24,SpazztasticKiwi,work offers vacation things. 5 destinations in a few certain (popular) cities for something like $50
17-07-2019T16:16:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Cincinnati (zoo) is included

17-07-2019T16:24:59,SpazztasticKiwi,‚Äúmr lonely‚Äù plays distantly
17-07-2019T17:27:23,IronHorseComics,did someone say Mr Lonely?
17-07-2019T17:27:42,IronHorseComics,anyone see the new Cats trailer?
17-07-2019T17:27:48,IronHorseComics,it's...something
17-07-2019T17:38:05,AspiringNoodle,"This is amazing.  Not only is the G.skill memory NOT sold out yet, it actually dropped in price"
17-07-2019T17:38:20,AspiringNoodle,Guess I have a bit of time to solidify my build :P
17-07-2019T18:05:31,IronHorseComics,so Noodle
17-07-2019T18:11:18,AspiringNoodle,Yeeeeeeees? :3
17-07-2019T18:12:31,IronHorseComics,"I kinda decided to give the old look of my cat girls another go, but with some tweaks. the main issues of the nose, and lips have been addressed https://sta.sh/019xaqr52if7"
17-07-2019T18:13:12,IronHorseComics,the reason for this is I feel I would be a lot more limited with expressions with the more feline design
17-07-2019T18:15:48,AspiringNoodle,Go for it
17-07-2019T18:16:21,AspiringNoodle,And look around at other furry artists if you ever want to give the feline face another go
17-07-2019T18:16:59,AspiringNoodle,"I've seen artists go for a more 3d render design, and I've seen them go with the more cartoon / manga-esque mouth types to great effect"
17-07-2019T18:17:47,IronHorseComics,"maybe later when I want to experiment, I actually have an idea as to why the cats are the most human-like of all the people in Fluffy 500, even the monkeys and apes aren't as close"
17-07-2019T18:17:57,IronHorseComics,"*had, I had one for a while"
17-07-2019T18:19:21,IronHorseComics,now how to explain it and when would be a good time to implement it is up in the air
17-07-2019T18:20:11,IronHorseComics,"now, back to the Ducktales fanart"
17-07-2019T18:32:09,SpazztasticKiwi,as soon as I pull up the camera to snap some squirrels
17-07-2019T18:32:12,SpazztasticKiwi,poof
17-07-2019T18:32:32,SpazztasticKiwi,not a one to see
17-07-2019T18:32:54,IronHorseComics,they were ghosts this whole time!
17-07-2019T18:34:00,SpazztasticKiwi,been a surprising amount of people here to hit the track
17-07-2019T19:23:47,SpazztasticKiwi,the dude just got back from his MRI CT and ABC exams & having some trouble. Should I really drop by
17-07-2019T19:24:30,IronHorseComics,probably
17-07-2019T19:24:51,SpazztasticKiwi,I just got done with 3 miles tho
17-07-2019T19:24:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Is it reaaaaally a good idea
17-07-2019T19:40:55,AspiringNoodle,"I almost got screwed over by Newegg, lol"
17-07-2019T19:55:15,SpazztasticKiwi,sounds like you sneezed on the keyboard there
17-07-2019T19:55:25,SpazztasticKiwi,tf is a newegg
17-07-2019T19:55:50,SpazztasticKiwi,one google search later..
17-07-2019T19:55:54,SpazztasticKiwi,ah
17-07-2019T19:55:57,AspiringNoodle,It's more or less THE website to go to for pc hardware and random electronics :D
17-07-2019T19:56:28,AspiringNoodle,"That said... the power supply I want is $160 on Newegg, $110 on Amazon and elsewhere"
17-07-2019T19:56:31,Bgrmystr2,"Kiwi, we talk about newegg on this chat all the time"
17-07-2019T19:56:34,Bgrmystr2,with you here
17-07-2019T19:56:44,Bgrmystr2,how do you not know
17-07-2019T19:56:45,AspiringNoodle,The free game + in-game skin doesn't exactly make up the $50 difference xD
17-07-2019T19:57:01,Bgrmystr2,are you fomo in disguise
17-07-2019T20:06:36,AspiringNoodle,The memory still has not sold out
17-07-2019T20:06:49,AspiringNoodle,"I'm worried that if I take it easy and check tomorrow, it will have sold out xD"
17-07-2019T20:54:58,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm incredibly unobervant sometimes
17-07-2019T20:55:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Unobservant

17-07-2019T22:13:11,AspiringNoodle,"...I feel like Eric Cartman during the Wii episode, lol"
17-07-2019T22:13:29,AspiringNoodle,Because it's a literal representation of me the past few weeks (year if we're being honest)
17-07-2019T22:22:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I got chips and a good sandwich
17-07-2019T22:25:04,AspiringNoodle,Serious question
17-07-2019T22:25:15,AspiringNoodle,Am I the only one tired of euphemistic bullshit?
17-07-2019T22:25:52,AspiringNoodle,"It's my fault for getting back into political videos for the day, but that's been a burning hatred of mine for a long time"
