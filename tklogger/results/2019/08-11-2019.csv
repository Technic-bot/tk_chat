08-11-2019T00:00:31,Muddy,"A Magnolia tree behind her, and a cold Mint Julep in one hand?"
08-11-2019T00:00:39,AcePilotIV,ive been playing too much wt again cya all later
08-11-2019T00:00:42,AcePilotIV,byeeeeeeee
08-11-2019T00:00:51,Muddy,Later Ace
08-11-2019T00:02:26,Twokinds,Goodbye forever
08-11-2019T00:02:35,BadFoMo,I think I'm going to take a quick nap.
08-11-2019T00:02:45,FloofyCat,Goodbye forever
08-11-2019T00:03:59,SageSaga,is this a break in consciousness joke?
08-11-2019T00:05:53,Muddy,"I wonder.. if Rose had ever gotten married, would her kids have had even stronger magical skills?"
08-11-2019T00:06:35,Twokinds,Rose isn't particularly strong in magic herself
08-11-2019T00:06:55,Twokinds,So not unless she had chicldren with someone who was strong too.
08-11-2019T00:06:57,DarthRexKing,But she can still outsmart and outwit people. :V
08-11-2019T00:07:00,Muddy,"Before, or after Trace restricted her magic?"
08-11-2019T00:07:13,SageSaga,he didnt do that?
08-11-2019T00:07:26,SageSaga,he restricted her access to the mansions power
08-11-2019T00:07:37,SpazztasticKiwi,you think some of the jokes that happen here take conscious thought?
08-11-2019T00:07:53,Muddy,I though... OH!  That's right. Thanks Tom. I forgot.
08-11-2019T00:08:12,FloofyCat,So is magical ability inherited and not just random?
08-11-2019T00:09:07,SpazztasticKiwi,"“hon, do you remember if there’s magic in the family?”"
08-11-2019T00:09:10,SpazztasticKiwi,“why?”
08-11-2019T00:09:26,FloofyCat,Or is it like Harry Potter where it's more or less random but more magic in one of the parents means more chance of a magical child?
08-11-2019T00:09:28,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"""Babies flying."""
08-11-2019T00:09:39,SpazztasticKiwi,“it’s the kiddos lunchtime and the kitchen table is levitating”
08-11-2019T00:09:56,Muddy,Tom? Ever consider a family tree layout for Rose and others?
08-11-2019T00:10:03,SageSaga,then its not really random then is it Floofy?
08-11-2019T00:10:09,SageSaga,that's genetic
08-11-2019T00:11:35,Twokinds,Yeah it's like any other talent.
08-11-2019T00:12:16,Twokinds,"Like learning to draw. It's takes a lot of pratice, and some people just seem to have a knack for it."
08-11-2019T00:12:54,IronHorseComics,like me
08-11-2019T00:12:54,Twokinds,The perception of magic is a big skewed since the comic of course always follows interesting people
08-11-2019T00:12:56,IronHorseComics,I kid though
08-11-2019T00:13:13,Twokinds,Many of whom are protegies.
08-11-2019T00:13:20,IronHorseComics,it took me a while to get even where I am and I still have lots to improve on
08-11-2019T00:14:08,Muddy,"I work in oils, as a hobby, and it took me 10 years before my technique began to loosen up."
08-11-2019T00:14:41,FloofyCat,So anyone can actually do magic? It's just some people pick it up easier than others and most people don't have any access to learning materials for it?
08-11-2019T00:14:52,JeremySenpai,"Later Sage, Tom. off to a family BBQ"
08-11-2019T00:15:02,SageSaga,take care Jeremy! Have fun!

08-11-2019T01:07:00,Muddy,(sigh) If only these characters were really flesh and blood. Sure would make our Earth interesting.
08-11-2019T01:07:36,MarvTheHugPharaoh,A 6 foot tall dog walking around on two feet would be interesting
08-11-2019T01:07:59,Sclimshady,That would likely give me nightmares
08-11-2019T01:08:01,BadFoMo,"Nora: Yes; I would, if you know what I mean."
08-11-2019T01:08:26,RimaDraws,natani is 6'3''

08-11-2019T01:13:11,Twokinds,Unlike Zen or Natani.

08-11-2019T01:15:07,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Kiwi, why is that so on point?"
08-11-2019T01:15:14,Twokinds,Prob like 6'8 or something
08-11-2019T01:15:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"which means when she hugs him, she should sink halfway in like a memory foam mattress"
08-11-2019T01:15:20,RimaDraws,<3

08-11-2019T01:16:02,unsteddyphoenix,What's the average wolf height range then
08-11-2019T01:16:03,JojoF2415,If I were in the Twokinds universe. I would be short
08-11-2019T01:16:09,Muddy,"Brutus could break someone like a twig, and not know it till it was too late."
08-11-2019T01:16:10,BadFoMo,Brutus: I ght things off the /top/ shelf!
08-11-2019T01:16:16,BadFoMo,*get
08-11-2019T01:16:43,Twokinds,I don't know
08-11-2019T01:17:50,FloofyCat,Wolf Raine is the same height.
08-11-2019T01:17:50,unsteddyphoenix,6-7 feet? 6.5 average ISH?
08-11-2019T01:17:56,BadFoMo,Ave Height = Tall - Slightly Taller.
08-11-2019T01:18:11,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"I'd say around 6'3"" teddy"
08-11-2019T01:18:15,JojoF2415,All I know is that wolves are tall
08-11-2019T01:18:16,Twokinds,nah nah
08-11-2019T01:18:27,Twokinds,average wolf height probably around 6'
08-11-2019T01:18:38,FreelancerAgentMaine,I love talking about height because my character is so obscenely tall nobody can compete with me
08-11-2019T01:18:39,Twokinds,Maybe a little more
08-11-2019T01:18:52,Mihari,It's not a competition :P
08-11-2019T01:18:56,FreelancerAgentMaine,"also I'm pretty sure I weigh around 1,200 lb"
08-11-2019T01:19:16,FreelancerAgentMaine,I'd like to make it clear I'm not fat my armor is just really heavy
08-11-2019T01:19:23,JojoF2415,I want an anvil
08-11-2019T01:19:45,FloofyCat,"I'd have thought just half a foot more than this, since with Rose + Raine being like the average height of a guy today, and the average height of girl being somewhere between 5'4"" to 5'7"" it'd be kinda the same difference"
08-11-2019T01:19:49,FloofyCat,If that even made any sense.
08-11-2019T01:19:54,Muddy,"My Kodiak fursonna's around 250 lbs., max."
08-11-2019T01:20:01,jirka,Rose very nice work Tom:ok_hand:

08-11-2019T01:20:31,Muddy,"Makes sense, Floofy"
08-11-2019T01:20:39,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Who's the smallest?
08-11-2019T01:20:43,JojoF2415,Rose is one of my favorite characters behind kat
08-11-2019T01:20:45,Twokinds,Just look at Clovis.
08-11-2019T01:20:47,FloofyCat,Like the same size difference between human males/females today but the females are as tall as human males today. But hecc.
08-11-2019T01:20:49,unsteddyphoenix,ALLEGEDLY
08-11-2019T01:20:51,CrimsonHelsing,"hey Tom, I think something might've gotten mistyped on the left column under ""Elder"": specifically ""wolf-weary"" instead of world-weary"
08-11-2019T01:20:58,unsteddyphoenix,Smol fox genes
08-11-2019T01:20:59,BadFoMo,"Old Man: WHAT, is the average height of a Wolf Keidran? ???: ...Is it Snow or Forest? Old Man: ...I don't know? AHH!"

08-11-2019T01:21:49,Muddy,"Hey I have a question, Tom.  Is Keidran pronounced ""Kee-Dran"" or ""Ky-Dran""?"
08-11-2019T01:21:57,FloofyCat,The purest of pure bread!
08-11-2019T01:22:02,BadFoMo,The later.
08-11-2019T01:22:11,AnuSekaniArt,"I always thought it was ""Kay-dran"""
08-11-2019T01:22:21,Twokinds,It's pronounced Qwaydran
08-11-2019T01:22:25,FloofyCat,"I pronounced it wrong for years, massively wrong."
08-11-2019T01:22:27,BadFoMo,AHH!
08-11-2019T01:22:34,unsteddyphoenix,"Pure as mud, clovis"
08-11-2019T01:22:39,JojoF2415,I’ve been saying it wrong
08-11-2019T01:22:41,CrimsonHelsing,"last I heard him say the word out loud years back, it was like that, like ""k-eye-dran"""
08-11-2019T01:22:43,Muddy,Qwaydran?  Interesting.
08-11-2019T01:22:56,MarvTheHugPharaoh,If serp was here he would be freaking out over the fact that there is no U after the Q
08-11-2019T01:22:59,FloofyCat,Oh that's weird
08-11-2019T01:23:02,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-laura:Yep that's how it's pronounced
08-11-2019T01:23:07,FloofyCat,I thought I was pronouncing it more wrong.
08-11-2019T01:23:09,Sclimshady,qui gon jinn
08-11-2019T01:23:09,AnuSekaniArt,"Uh huh, sure Tom :P"
08-11-2019T01:23:40,FloofyCat,I pronounced it the same but drean instead of dran. I have no idea why or how I started pronouncing an 'e' in there a little bit.
08-11-2019T01:23:43,Muddy,And Basitin is like Bassett ?
08-11-2019T01:23:48,FloofyCat,Considering there is no 'e' there at all.
08-11-2019T01:23:48,FreelancerAgentMaine,honestly if I learn it's pronounced differently from how I normally say it I'm going to not care
08-11-2019T01:24:02,ReBob,Qui gon dran.
08-11-2019T01:24:06,FloofyCat,I pronounced it as bass-e-tin pfft

08-11-2019T01:25:40,FloofyCat,@Unsteddyphoenix Reminds me of Cerberus from Mass Effect.
08-11-2019T01:26:16,Muddy,Well... learning Keidran's pronounce Qwaydran has really expanded my appreciation for the comic.
08-11-2019T01:26:17,BadFoMo,Is this Human-ish Reni's outfit?
08-11-2019T01:26:18,TheFreindlyDeathclaw,ooh cool outfit

08-11-2019T01:28:53,AnuSekaniArt,It's a sharp and eye catching color scheme for sure ^^
08-11-2019T01:28:59,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Sketch looking good Sage
08-11-2019T01:29:14,CrimsonHelsing,"a good color scheme that is commanding of exibition, Tom"
08-11-2019T01:29:24,unsteddyphoenix,It is extremely classy
08-11-2019T01:29:44,JojoF2415,I should be going to bed but meh
08-11-2019T01:29:44,Muddy,Like the European cut of the jacket.
08-11-2019T01:30:21,Mihari,"I'd hate to compare it, but it really gives me that Deux Ex vibe from recent entries, which I absolutely adored."
08-11-2019T01:30:24,Muddy,"I'm yawning myself, Jojo.  I only got 3 hours sleep last night."
08-11-2019T01:30:54,AnuSekaniArt,Eyyy Mihari!
08-11-2019T01:30:54,BadFoMo,I was getting Star Trek vibes from it.
08-11-2019T01:30:55,Twokinds,I do love Deus Ex
08-11-2019T01:31:17,FloofyCat,I wonder what it'd look like if the darker black bits of the jacket were made with scales.
08-11-2019T01:31:17,JojoF2415,I’m so happy that it’s Friday. The teachers decided to give all the big projects at the same time
08-11-2019T01:31:25,Muddy,"Like a Picard look to it, BadFoMo?"
08-11-2019T01:31:34,FloofyCat,Yeah which series? pfft.
08-11-2019T01:31:48,FloofyCat,It looks kinda like the TNG admiral uniforms.
08-11-2019T01:31:58,BadFoMo,I think so? I've never really watched the show.
08-11-2019T01:32:08,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Are those different ranking symbols, Tom?"
08-11-2019T01:32:15,CrimsonHelsing,certainly implies possibly high-ranking status
08-11-2019T01:32:19,Mihari,"You made me smile, Tom."
08-11-2019T01:32:23,Muddy,Jojo.. I know about that end of things... I'm actually a math instructor.
08-11-2019T01:32:37,JojoF2415,Math didn’t give me anything
08-11-2019T01:33:02,ColeRusz,sans eye
08-11-2019T01:33:03,Mihari,"If I was a patreon I'd be asking for Flora with the Shade looking down at her chest going ""I didn't ask for this"" best of all the worlds!"
08-11-2019T01:33:05,Muddy,I deal in adult ed... Math... the 4-letter word.
08-11-2019T01:33:10,JojoF2415,I had a lot of presentations this week

08-11-2019T15:29:54,JojoF2415,Hello
08-11-2019T15:30:11,AspiringNoodle,I feel validated
08-11-2019T15:30:45,AspiringNoodle,"Finally got the old computer into the shop.  Tech confirmed my suspicion, bad PCIe slot"
08-11-2019T15:31:02,tehbear,use another one instead?
08-11-2019T15:31:05,AspiringNoodle,"GPU got moved down 1 slot so now my parents have a functional, decent computer :ptv-hearts:"
08-11-2019T15:31:41,AspiringNoodle,Assuming I didn't break the slot trying to remove the big card and not realizing that the weird looking thing had a latch I needed to pull :ptv-confused:
08-11-2019T15:32:04,tehbear,hehe. those plasticy bits are not needed if you can keep the card in place by other means
08-11-2019T15:32:29,tehbear,ive probably broken half a dozen of them over the years
08-11-2019T15:32:49,AspiringNoodle,I'm just hoping I didn't break any soldering
08-11-2019T15:33:05,AspiringNoodle,The good news is that it's an x16 slot that's only setup for x8
08-11-2019T15:33:13,AspiringNoodle,So all the soldering is on the OPPOSITE side of where I was lifting
08-11-2019T15:34:07,tehbear,"somehow ive never managed to break a isa, pci, agp or pci-e card"
08-11-2019T15:34:18,AspiringNoodle,Neither have I :3
08-11-2019T15:34:33,AspiringNoodle,But the slot breaking?  I'm probably not that surprised
08-11-2019T15:34:46,AspiringNoodle,"6 - 7 year old pc, lower end mobo"
08-11-2019T15:34:50,tehbear,i have how ever broken the case-less type AMD cpus where the die is exposed
08-11-2019T15:34:52,AspiringNoodle,Big ol' GTX 970 in there
08-11-2019T15:35:14,AspiringNoodle,Over time the card probably bent the slot slightly and broke some connections
08-11-2019T15:35:16,tehbear,killed a duron 1.3GHz by installing the cooler with too much force
08-11-2019T15:35:22,AspiringNoodle,LMAO
08-11-2019T15:35:44,AspiringNoodle,Cooling: :ptv-hearts:
08-11-2019T15:35:52,AspiringNoodle,Vigorous cooling: :ptv-angry:
08-11-2019T15:35:58,AspiringNoodle,Ded cpu: :ptv-whiny:
08-11-2019T15:36:12,tehbear,that sinking feeling when your brand new rig doesnt boot
08-11-2019T15:36:33,AspiringNoodle,I swear every amatuer builder probably has a heart attack when they first start up a new build
08-11-2019T15:36:47,AspiringNoodle,Nobody expects the first-time power cycle :ptv-snicker:
08-11-2019T15:38:07,tehbear,my last build wouldnt boot because the mobo didnt like having 2 DDR chips on the same channel ( i think ) .. had to movefrom a1 a2 to a1 b1 configuration and it booted.
08-11-2019T15:38:25,AspiringNoodle,"Huh, weird"
08-11-2019T15:40:34,tehbear,"by far, the component ive had most issue is with is RAM. Buying cheap ram and only 1 of 2 chips working out of the box, not a good way to save $"
08-11-2019T15:40:57,AspiringNoodle,"Which is funny, since RAM is the most reliable component out there"
08-11-2019T15:40:58,tehbear,and im careful to ground myself and not dragging feet over carpets and such
08-11-2019T15:41:31,AspiringNoodle,Puget systems actually put together the stats on all their part failures
08-11-2019T15:41:40,AspiringNoodle,"Both during the build, and after it leaves the store"
08-11-2019T15:41:55,AspiringNoodle,And RAM is stupidly reliable
08-11-2019T15:41:55,sunblaze,hmm sge is gone again.
08-11-2019T15:42:04,AspiringNoodle,Something like only a .2% failure rate during the build
08-11-2019T15:42:07,sunblaze,I guess no luck fixing wonky interwebs :(
08-11-2019T15:44:09,tehbear,hmmm. ive had a surprisingly lot of cheap DoA Ballistix RAM modules
08-11-2019T15:44:39,tehbear,"or modules that seemed to work fine, but caused random crashes, and memcheck86 reported faulty modules"
08-11-2019T15:44:54,AspiringNoodle,"Yeeeeeah, that's why I go with trusted brands"
08-11-2019T15:45:52,tehbear,PSUs are also something one should never buy cheap

08-11-2019T17:23:25,tehbear,seems people have been negative about their next game: sword and shield

08-11-2019T17:31:55,tehbear,their legal dptmnt is probably on par with Disney so its not surprising
08-11-2019T17:45:19,Dadrobit,The thing is that they're completely cutting out a bunch of Pokemon from the next series.
08-11-2019T17:46:02,Dadrobit,"At first I was dubious but hopeful that maybe it was just a few odds and ends. But nope, the totaly number of cut Pokemon is roughly 60% of all Pokemon."
08-11-2019T17:46:16,Dadrobit,"Completely unavailble in the game, not even able to import."
08-11-2019T17:47:05,Dadrobit,"Every single starter line of Pokemon, (except Pikachu and Charmander) every Legenday exept Mew, and just a shitload of general Pokemon."
08-11-2019T17:47:11,Dadrobit,All cut
08-11-2019T17:47:19,Dadrobit,For no fucking reason
08-11-2019T17:47:46,Dadrobit,"Well, there's a reason: Lazy Greed"
08-11-2019T17:48:21,Dadrobit,There are fewer Pokemon available in the newest game on the newest hardware than there were in fucking X and Y..
08-11-2019T17:48:46,Dadrobit,"Infuriating, absolutely infuriating."
08-11-2019T17:50:56,Dadrobit,"""It's too much work to animate"" Bitches, y'all couldn't even animate Voltorb? It's a fuckin' ball with eyes. Pure unadaulturated languorous greed"
08-11-2019T17:51:56,TerraTheWizard,also the ones they picked seemed to be totally at random
08-11-2019T17:52:05,TerraTheWizard,except for the 4 that are their babies
08-11-2019T17:52:14,TerraTheWizard,"charizard, pikachu, eevee, and lucario"
08-11-2019T17:52:27,Dadrobit,"Mew, Pikachu, Charizard, Evee, Lucario"
08-11-2019T17:52:36,Dadrobit,yepper
08-11-2019T17:52:56,TerraTheWizard,they did a poll in japan of people's favourite pokemon
08-11-2019T17:53:04,TerraTheWizard,"of a list of 100, only 23 made it in"
08-11-2019T17:53:15,TerraTheWizard,and the #1 didn't make it
08-11-2019T17:53:41,Dadrobit,"No joke, I was legitimately considering picking up a Switch for this if they just let me have my Fennekin"
08-11-2019T17:54:13,TerraTheWizard,apparenly the ceo had some totally bs reasons
08-11-2019T17:54:17,Dadrobit,This shit it the most system seller IP they could ever possibly ask for and they fucked it THIS hard?
08-11-2019T17:54:28,TerraTheWizard,"one of them was something along the lines of ""mobile platforms are more popular"""
08-11-2019T17:55:05,TerraTheWizard,imagine you're told to work on a thing
08-11-2019T17:55:08,Dadrobit,"Don't worry, they kept Trubbish!!!"
08-11-2019T17:55:22,TerraTheWizard,"but then tell your boss ""sorry, the competitors make a better thing so i give up"""
08-11-2019T17:56:36,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-flomad:
08-11-2019T17:57:10,Dadrobit,I am no joke legitimately enraged by this.
08-11-2019T17:57:33,TerraTheWizard,they cut herdier
08-11-2019T17:58:03,TerraTheWizard,a pokemon that's *based on a dog from where the region is based on*
