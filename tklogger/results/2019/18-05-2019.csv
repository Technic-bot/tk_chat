18-05-2019T13:15:28,IronHorseComics,"It's the last week before the Indy 500, since next Sunday would be the color stream, it's the last time to have a sketch that fits a theme"
18-05-2019T13:17:18,TerraTheWizard,what's the indy 500?
18-05-2019T13:17:20,TerraTheWizard,nascar?
18-05-2019T13:18:34,IronHorseComics,"no, the Indianpolis 500 predates NASCAR by a long stretch"
18-05-2019T13:18:55,IronHorseComics,it's the premier race for American open wheeled racing
18-05-2019T13:19:00,IronHorseComics,so it's IndyCar
18-05-2019T13:20:27,IronHorseComics,"to qualify you have to be among the 33 fastest cars on the circuit, not lap time, average speed"
18-05-2019T13:21:42,TerraTheWizard,my knowledge of racing barely extends beyond f1
18-05-2019T13:21:56,TerraTheWizard,and even then it's pretty non-existant
18-05-2019T13:23:11,IronHorseComics,"The Indy 500 is one of three races in all of motorsports that is ""The Triple Crown"", the other two are the Monaco Grand Prix in F1 (or an F1 world championship), and the 24 hours of Le Mans endurance race"

18-05-2019T14:09:42,CrimsonQuill,I might be well off looking over notes during the stream.

18-05-2019T14:57:42,Twokinds,The whole voting system is in flux this week
18-05-2019T14:57:46,Twokinds,This month
18-05-2019T14:57:55,Twokinds,I'm going to see about having some open votes again

18-05-2019T14:59:48,TerraTheWizard,great google-y moogly
18-05-2019T14:59:49,RimaDraws,that voting system is pretty neat.
18-05-2019T15:00:10,CrimsonQuill,But confusing...
18-05-2019T15:00:21,TerraTheWizard,how was it confusing?
18-05-2019T15:00:25,TerraTheWizard,it was really simple
18-05-2019T15:00:47,CrimsonQuill,So many choices to scroll through
18-05-2019T15:00:48,Rrolf,My only nitpick is. I can't see it clearly stated that you have to be a supporter in order to vote.
18-05-2019T15:00:59,TerraTheWizard,"yeah, but you just had to check any you liked"
18-05-2019T15:01:02,TerraTheWizard,there was no limit

18-05-2019T15:02:38,Twokinds,Mostly because a lot of people don't watch the streams
18-05-2019T15:02:47,Twokinds,24 vote has much more opportunity

18-05-2019T15:23:30,Storyteller3010,Was hoping to be able to find out who all one. I really like the idea of the 24-hour vote rather than having to be here if you're not available.
18-05-2019T15:23:34,BadFoMo,I don't know?
18-05-2019T15:23:46,Storyteller3010,Probably be back in like 2 hours.

18-05-2019T15:24:45,Zakuru,big mood
18-05-2019T15:24:47,Storyteller3010,You could always do a screenshot
18-05-2019T15:24:52,js199456,nvm found it

18-05-2019T15:25:16,Twokinds,The problem is google's default graph is really ugly
18-05-2019T15:25:26,Twokinds,The names don't show up for half of them unless you hovor over them
18-05-2019T15:25:32,Storyteller3010,All right well I'll be back later.
18-05-2019T15:25:35,Twokinds,So a screenshot isn't really helpful

18-05-2019T17:09:43,TeapotOfDoom,It makes your body burn fat instead of sugar by not giving it sugar.
18-05-2019T17:09:50,Bgrmystr2,naw Marv it is the size of exactly one tom.
18-05-2019T17:09:53,Bgrmystr2,I think it's the same.
18-05-2019T17:09:53,TerraTheWizard,:crab:
18-05-2019T17:09:54,ProsePro7,You will need carbs at some time to but the fat
18-05-2019T17:10:01,CrRAR,When you PUT IT like THAT Marv.

18-05-2019T17:10:36,FenceEqualizer,Thought it was confirm a safe diet as long as you're not Disbetic.
18-05-2019T17:10:40,RimaDraws,poor thing
18-05-2019T17:10:43,FenceEqualizer,Diabetic*
18-05-2019T17:10:45,CrRAR,Carbs and lots of sugars aren't so super great tho.
18-05-2019T17:10:45,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Save him Rima

18-05-2019T17:11:01,RimaDraws,she is just scared . she has been struck by lightning so thats why shes scared
18-05-2019T17:11:06,ProsePro7,Carbs should be a part of a diet but only a fraction

18-05-2019T17:11:43,SniperJackal,"balanced, as all things should"
18-05-2019T17:11:46,ProsePro7,Sugar is the one thing that we can all cut from our lives but even I have trouble with that

18-05-2019T17:12:03,CrRAR,ooo
18-05-2019T17:12:15,Bgrmystr2,sugars are also necessary. Just not a large amount of them.
18-05-2019T17:12:26,CrRAR,I think we can all agree on... staying away from the Trans Fats.
18-05-2019T17:12:29,RimaDraws,i have to limit my carbs to 30 grams a day
18-05-2019T17:12:31,CrRAR,(so tasty tho)
18-05-2019T17:12:41,ProsePro7,Sugar is just carbs and bad ones at that
18-05-2019T17:12:49,FenceEqualizer,Sugar is in everything I swear.

18-05-2019T17:13:06,ProsePro7,It is read your bread next time you eat it
18-05-2019T17:13:10,Twokinds,Sugar is next to unavoidable
18-05-2019T17:13:21,CrimsonQuill,So is this the massage?
18-05-2019T17:13:24,Twokinds,"Even with my extreme version of the diet, I can't avoid it completely."
18-05-2019T17:13:29,Ordithus,"Yes, Quill"
18-05-2019T17:13:29,RimaDraws,i cant stand the taste of sweet tea anymore
18-05-2019T17:13:30,ProsePro7,True also Twokinds but you can avoid the bad kind
18-05-2019T17:13:32,Twokinds,So there's probably no danger of having too little.
18-05-2019T17:14:03,MarvTheHugPharaoh,just make sure you don't over do it
18-05-2019T17:14:11,ProsePro7,There is levels of sugar and corn syrup is the worst of the worst simple carbs are bad and CS is like super simple carbs
18-05-2019T17:14:23,Ordithus,"In a ""natural"" diet most sugar comes from fruit, which has fiber to slow down the sugar absorption"
18-05-2019T17:14:40,RimaDraws,yea my friend did that and she dropped the pounds quick but also developed a eating disorder
18-05-2019T17:14:42,FloofyCat,Sugar is everywhere...
18-05-2019T17:14:48,RimaDraws,now she wont eat any normal foods
18-05-2019T17:14:57,FloofyCat,You open your closet and what do you find? Like ten bags of sugar.
18-05-2019T17:14:58,Aphala,Naturally occurring sugars (fruit and veg) vs the process bs

18-05-2019T17:15:52,FloofyCat,Some grape varieties are very sugary
18-05-2019T17:16:03,RimaDraws,i am going to get back on my strict diet this week and exercise. i need to lose the weight. i wish i was at toms weight
18-05-2019T17:16:10,FloofyCat,Sable and cotton candy. I'll leave you to guess what cotton candy grapes taste like.
18-05-2019T17:16:27,ProsePro7,Thats why people use them for wine its sounds sappy by organic is best

18-05-2019T18:33:41,unsteddyphoenix,since she was so into eric it was pointless for them

18-05-2019T19:21:13,AspiringNoodle,:)
18-05-2019T19:21:14,ElvenHunter84,I'm curious to see how my suggestion did
18-05-2019T19:21:17,InTheLionsDen,The birb has wings AND arms so why can't it have breasts?
18-05-2019T19:21:18,FenceEqualizer,Tell that to parrots.
18-05-2019T19:21:25,SamuelLeumas,What has been sketched so far? I just got here
18-05-2019T19:21:33,ProsePro7,I think I would very much like to see this one colored
18-05-2019T19:21:42,AspiringNoodle,I guess that's true.  But they do have extreme difficulty with certain phonemes.

18-05-2019T19:22:16,FloofyCat,Oh yeah Flora bragging to Kat about chest size.
18-05-2019T19:22:40,Andromedian1,shoulda used 'pronounce' rather than 'speak' Noodle
18-05-2019T19:22:40,AspiringNoodle,Imagine how devastated Flora would be if a bird person had the largest breasts of the entire cast?
18-05-2019T19:22:40,InTheLionsDen,@ElvenHunter84 It appears that only the top four voted will be sketched. Tom is picking the other three.
18-05-2019T19:22:53,NeonMitsumi,"Well, to sum up everything important... Kat, Kat, Evil Kat, and Kat but in Evals' body."

18-05-2019T19:23:42,unsteddyphoenix,There was a maren one?

18-05-2019T19:23:50,NeonMitsumi,Maren who?

18-05-2019T19:24:32,FenceEqualizer,Because Red seems to be facisnated in tails but only has the courage to touch them when they're from friends.
18-05-2019T19:24:35,Bgrmystr2,Red grabbed keidran maren's tail the wrong way basically.
18-05-2019T19:24:39,Bgrmystr2,was the sketch
18-05-2019T19:24:41,Bgrmystr2,it was great
18-05-2019T19:24:47,InTheLionsDen,This is the fifth sketch but it is the third in the voting ranking.
18-05-2019T19:24:48,Bgrmystr2,just not for red.
18-05-2019T19:24:50,Ordithus,Red is now kill

18-05-2019T19:24:56,FenceEqualizer,He was strangling it.
18-05-2019T19:24:57,FloofyCat,Oh yeah that'd work better
18-05-2019T19:25:01,NeonMitsumi,We already had Nora Toothless thing
18-05-2019T19:25:03,Bgrmystr2,yeah red is definitely kill.

18-05-2019T19:25:09,FloofyCat,We did with Zen for the first movie
18-05-2019T19:25:15,CrRAR,Natani finally has competition for archery skills.

18-05-2019T19:26:05,CrRAR,lol
18-05-2019T19:26:05,ElvenHunter84,Did he reveal the voting ranking earlier?
18-05-2019T19:26:06,Ordithus,That was goaltending
18-05-2019T19:26:07,AspiringNoodle,We don't sdiscuss the fox waifu
18-05-2019T19:26:09,CrRAR,;_;
18-05-2019T19:26:20,CrRAR,Yeah that was Alabastard's fault
18-05-2019T19:26:31,NeonMitsumi,She missed on purpose so she can have Keith for herself :v
18-05-2019T19:26:31,Bgrmystr2,I don't think Natani's skills are what prevented her from hitting the target when they were being openly blocked by someone else.
18-05-2019T19:26:32,InTheLionsDen,"No, he is revealing it as he goes."
18-05-2019T19:26:36,Bgrmystr2,skill doesn't prevent that.
18-05-2019T19:26:41,CrRAR,Natani should have mastered the arrowbending skill I guess xD
18-05-2019T19:26:55,SamuelLeumas,Anyone got screenshots of the previous sketches within this session?
18-05-2019T19:27:03,Ordithus,Laura should've suplexed Alabaster into the tower
18-05-2019T19:27:03,IronHorseComics,I look at my comic page for one minute and the whole chat goes mad?
18-05-2019T19:27:09,Combak,We do a recap at the end

18-05-2019T19:27:26,SamuelLeumas,"@Combak I know we do, but I wanted to know what is done so far"
18-05-2019T19:27:59,SamuelLeumas,"See if my suggestion got in or not, because this is my last attempt for it"

18-05-2019T20:58:54,FenceEqualizer,Macaroni tax doesn't come cheap for the macaroni tavern.

18-05-2019T20:59:39,NeonMitsumi,"Merry Christmas, Teddy."
18-05-2019T20:59:42,ElvenHunter84,but I saw it coming with the unified vote
18-05-2019T20:59:42,SamuelLeumas,Not enough kat

18-05-2019T21:00:20,KiTA,which suddenly made me think of Kat-as-a-pikachu-girl
18-05-2019T21:00:23,unsteddyphoenix,"Honestly, lot of good expressions in this one too"
18-05-2019T21:00:23,CrRAR,squisssies

18-05-2019T21:03:17,KiTA,"That's the artist of, like a dozen mangas and several anime, doing his own version of a picarto stream"

18-05-2019T21:03:30,FloofyCat,Are you gunna open the suggestions earlier if we're doing another giant vote?
18-05-2019T21:03:41,SamuelLeumas,It is advised to get permission to post a link before posting one
18-05-2019T21:05:23,Bgrmystr2,lol KiTA people have been streaming drawing before picarto existed
18-05-2019T21:05:28,Bgrmystr2,way long before

18-05-2019T21:37:47,Twokinds,I can't even guess which sketch it is
18-05-2019T21:39:18,Ordithus,Kat x Kat
18-05-2019T21:39:30,Ordithus,:ptv-shipit: ?
18-05-2019T21:39:30,Twokinds,"Oh, then not the one I thought"
18-05-2019T21:39:57,Twokinds,lol
18-05-2019T21:40:06,unsteddyphoenix,"Hey, it is a good one though"
18-05-2019T21:40:18,Ordithus,"Haha, it's lewd!  ""Which one?"""
18-05-2019T21:40:35,Twokinds,Kat falling in love with herself would be a very strange end to her troubled love life. XD Talk about desperate measures.
18-05-2019T21:40:56,unsteddyphoenix,Just when you think her love life couldnt get any sadder
18-05-2019T21:40:58,Ordithus,They always say to love yourself
18-05-2019T21:41:05,Ordithus,She's just taking it a step further
18-05-2019T21:41:06,unsteddyphoenix,"Then again, who else is good enough for her."
18-05-2019T21:41:57,Ordithus,"Gonna be hard to sleep tonight.  I'm still on Pacific time, living in Central"

18-05-2019T21:44:05,FenceEqualizer,Don't stare to hard. You'll get a seizure.
18-05-2019T21:44:13,NeonMitsumi,I have them all as Discord emotes. lol
18-05-2019T21:44:15,FenceEqualizer,Jesus christ!
18-05-2019T21:44:18,NeonMitsumi,And I am making more.
18-05-2019T21:44:31,unsteddyphoenix,A kat for every occassion
18-05-2019T21:44:37,NeonMitsumi,Definitely.
18-05-2019T21:44:48,Ordithus,One might get the impression you like Kat
18-05-2019T21:44:51,NeonMitsumi,I am tempted to buy Picarto premium just to post them all here. lol
18-05-2019T21:45:27,Bgrmystr2,jeez calm down
18-05-2019T21:45:45,NeonMitsumi,No :cneonmitsumi-katgoesnyoooooom:
18-05-2019T21:45:47,FloofyCat,Calm up \o/
18-05-2019T21:50:01,Ordithus,"Oh, Tom, good strem.  Fun selection.  Snep heavy"
18-05-2019T21:53:17,Twokinds,Thanks!
18-05-2019T21:53:23,Ordithus,Aaaand now I know why you thought it was a different sketch for the vod thumbnail
18-05-2019T21:53:39,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-KeithNeat:
18-05-2019T21:54:44,Twokinds,lol
18-05-2019T21:54:45,Twokinds,Yeah
18-05-2019T21:54:54,Twokinds,I have the vote graph results
18-05-2019T21:55:22,Ordithus,Oh?
18-05-2019T21:58:40,unsteddyphoenix,Ok
18-05-2019T21:58:45,unsteddyphoenix,Wanna give us a sneak peek?
18-05-2019T22:04:12,FenceEqualizer,🕵🏻 Wouldn't mind a sneak look
18-05-2019T22:07:52,Twokinds,It's pretty huge
18-05-2019T22:07:59,Twokinds,And was kind of a pain to put together
18-05-2019T22:08:28,Twokinds,http://twokindscomic.com/images/omnipoll20190519.png
18-05-2019T22:09:12,Ordithus,"Wow, that wound up way more clear than I expected"
18-05-2019T22:09:26,Bgrmystr2,wow damn
18-05-2019T22:11:09,Bgrmystr2,>Tom Reference sheet :ptv-laugh: what even is this suggestion
18-05-2019T22:11:17,unsteddyphoenix,Ikr
18-05-2019T22:11:18,Twokinds,"Kat against glass was originally lower than Birbkinds, but more people voted after the stream started, pushing it above Birb."
18-05-2019T22:11:38,unsteddyphoenix,Haha
18-05-2019T22:11:47,unsteddyphoenix,They realised that it was a kat stream toady
18-05-2019T22:12:00,unsteddyphoenix,I see. There just werent many ref sheet pics at all huh.
18-05-2019T22:12:07,BadFoMo,"71?! But again, lost the tie."
18-05-2019T22:12:49,Twokinds,Yeah they didn't get voted on nearly as much as last time either. Except for... Tom for some reason. Whhhyyy
18-05-2019T22:13:02,unsteddyphoenix,Lmao
18-05-2019T22:13:08,unsteddyphoenix,Extremely good question
18-05-2019T22:13:13,Ordithus,Seems your Patrons are a cruel bunch
18-05-2019T22:13:15,Twokinds,"I hope they realize it won't be a ME reference sheet, but the background delivery guy. XD"
18-05-2019T22:13:15,FenceEqualizer,The memes that's why
18-05-2019T22:13:31,unsteddyphoenix,"How does it feel knowing you, the author, is more popular than the protagonist"
18-05-2019T22:13:40,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-karenOOO:
18-05-2019T22:13:42,BadFoMo,"Wait, there was voting /during/ the stream?"
18-05-2019T22:13:43,unsteddyphoenix,113 to 94
18-05-2019T22:13:46,Twokinds,No
18-05-2019T22:13:50,unsteddyphoenix,Is this a good thing or a bad thing
18-05-2019T22:13:52,Twokinds,Votes weren't counted after the stream started
18-05-2019T22:14:00,Twokinds,But people could still vote.
18-05-2019T22:14:16,Twokinds,So the numbers changed a little.
18-05-2019T22:14:23,FenceEqualizer,"I kinda like this format to be honest, gives a more clear view of where your suggestion stands"
18-05-2019T22:14:32,Ordithus,"So these numbers are post-stream, not what you used?"
18-05-2019T22:14:48,Twokinds,They're roughly accurate
18-05-2019T22:14:55,BadFoMo,"...I'm sorry, but that doesn't sound like a good idea."
18-05-2019T22:14:59,Twokinds,There was only a few extra votes after we started
18-05-2019T22:15:14,Twokinds,"Bad, I just forgot to close the votes down it wasn't on purpose."
18-05-2019T22:15:45,BadFoMo,Oh. Never mind then.
18-05-2019T22:16:03,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah so was tkpolls just broken today?
18-05-2019T22:16:20,Twokinds,I dunno?
18-05-2019T22:16:28,BadFoMo,I think it just wasn't used.
18-05-2019T22:16:38,unsteddyphoenix,Oh I see
18-05-2019T22:16:54,unsteddyphoenix,"cause when I tried to ""log on"" it went to an error but, duh. We werent using it."
18-05-2019T22:16:59,FenceEqualizer,Thought Tom was testing this voting structure
18-05-2019T22:17:45,Ordithus,"On the plus side, way more voters.  On the negative, voting is less part of the main event than before.  Good and bad."
18-05-2019T22:18:16,unsteddyphoenix,There could always be a way to meld the two
18-05-2019T22:18:27,unsteddyphoenix,If Tom doesnt know what to pick for Tom picks he could refer to it
18-05-2019T22:18:39,unsteddyphoenix,"Or the last vote could be replaced with ""popular vote"""
18-05-2019T22:18:39,Twokinds,Yeah overall I like this voting system
18-05-2019T22:18:47,unsteddyphoenix,Things like that
18-05-2019T22:18:53,unsteddyphoenix,It did give some great pics :D
18-05-2019T22:18:54,Twokinds,"But I do feel like it misses out on the ""Audience participation"" part of the stream"
18-05-2019T22:19:22,Ordithus,"Yeah, that has been a fun part of it."
18-05-2019T22:19:36,Ordithus,But cannot deny the change in # of voters
18-05-2019T22:19:56,Twokinds,"Yeah, waaaay more participants"
18-05-2019T22:20:11,unsteddyphoenix,It'd be cool to test it a bit more
18-05-2019T22:20:18,Ordithus,"From what was it, 40-60, to 300+?  It was usually 90-150 in the open system I think"
18-05-2019T22:20:20,unsteddyphoenix,"For fair testing, see if a difference emerges"
18-05-2019T22:21:09,ElvenHunter84,Did Tom post the graph on here?
18-05-2019T22:21:16,Bgrmystr2,"the only reason there were more participants is because it was over a 24 hour period, wasn't it?"
18-05-2019T22:21:17,Ordithus,http://twokindscomic.com/images/omnipoll20190519.png
18-05-2019T22:21:28,Bgrmystr2,and it was announced on patreon rather than at a certain timeframe.
18-05-2019T22:21:31,Ordithus,"I expect so, bgr"
18-05-2019T22:21:43,ElvenHunter84,"Wow, mine lost by 2 votes"
18-05-2019T22:21:46,Ordithus,I know I've missed many votes because I was otherwise busy
18-05-2019T22:22:04,Bgrmystr2,"so of course it had more participation. I bet if there was a 24 hour public vote that was also announced, I bet there'd be even more voters than that one."
18-05-2019T22:22:27,ElvenHunter84,That's strangely more dissapointing than having it get no votes at all
18-05-2019T22:22:49,Ordithus,"It does mean it stands a decent chance in the future, people like it"
18-05-2019T22:23:10,Bgrmystr2,"Btw it was slightly higher than 170, Ord"
18-05-2019T22:23:14,Bgrmystr2,for the public votes
18-05-2019T22:23:25,Ordithus,"Depends on which vote, which stream"
18-05-2019T22:23:48,Ordithus,First poll usually had the least I think
18-05-2019T22:23:51,Bgrmystr2,120-170 seemed like.
18-05-2019T22:23:55,ElvenHunter84,I like this voting system. It looks like we got WAY more votes than the average TKpolls vote gets
18-05-2019T22:23:57,Bgrmystr2,first and last poll had the lowest votes
18-05-2019T22:24:06,ElvenHunter84,"Plus, this way everyone can participate even if they have to miss the stream"
18-05-2019T22:24:08,Bgrmystr2,I did a bit of looking back earlier today
18-05-2019T22:24:28,ElvenHunter84,"I work Sundays, so I never get to vote on most of the regular polls"
18-05-2019T22:24:34,Ordithus,How far back?  The more recent open votes were the ones that brought the rigging allegations
18-05-2019T22:24:43,Ordithus,Inflating their numbers
18-05-2019T22:24:56,Ordithus,"But anyways, I guess it doesn't really matte"
18-05-2019T22:24:57,Ordithus,r
18-05-2019T22:26:15,Bgrmystr2,"they've been upwards of 170 even before recently, but it's really dependant on the weekend and the poll. Sometimes people don't always participate in streams if they see something they don't like win the first poll"
18-05-2019T22:26:33,Bgrmystr2,so it's really hard tosay
18-05-2019T22:26:45,ElvenHunter84,the most votes I've ever seen one single sketch get was around 80
18-05-2019T22:27:03,ElvenHunter84,maybe the numbers just look bigger because it's not a ranking system this time
18-05-2019T22:27:14,Bgrmystr2,I had looked back a couple weeks ago for a couple months of streams and they seemed to be all similarish. within a couple dozen
18-05-2019T22:27:52,Bgrmystr2,"the trends seem to stay consistant, more people vote in the middle of the stream than the early or late parts"
18-05-2019T22:28:22,Ordithus,"Makes sense, Europe goes to bed for the late and people trickle in for the early"
18-05-2019T22:28:38,Bgrmystr2,yeah
18-05-2019T22:33:07,FenceEqualizer,"Oh Tom, if you're still here, I wanted to say thank you for throwing my suggestion into the ballet. Really appreciate it. :ptv-victory:"
18-05-2019T22:34:28,Twokinds,No prob!
18-05-2019T22:34:32,Ordithus,So... 4 of 6 of my last suggestions to get drawn have nekkid dudes.  Um
18-05-2019T22:35:01,RimaDraws,ouch 59 votes
18-05-2019T22:36:13,ElvenHunter84,"Tom, did you have to manually count all the votes, or do you have some kind of program that runs that?"
18-05-2019T22:37:21,BadFoMo,@FenceEqualizer What was your's? The Tom one?
18-05-2019T22:37:23,Twokinds,pff

18-05-2019T22:37:56,BadFoMo,I voted for it.
18-05-2019T22:38:05,Ordithus,":ctwokinds-rose:*[Flora, deary, strum that one more time and you will find out how deep this estate goes]"

18-05-2019T22:39:30,BadFoMo,"Well, after the color vote, see you all in October."
18-05-2019T22:39:36,ElvenHunter84,Even the ones I expected to get like 0 to 10 votes got around 20
18-05-2019T22:40:00,RimaDraws,yea my bfs got 26
18-05-2019T22:40:22,BadFoMo,What was his?

18-05-2019T22:40:47,DanaTheBabyFox,Aw dud i miss it
18-05-2019T22:42:13,BadFoMo,"Also, if you're still here, Tom, do you think this one would make it to the polls for Halloween?"
18-05-2019T22:42:25,BadFoMo,"""90.	The Ghosts of Nibs, Flora, Laura, Trace and Saria are swinging on one of the mansion's big chandeliers, having the time of their After-Lives! (Sequel to 2018’s Halloween filler. http://cdn.twokinds.keenspot.com/comics/20181031halloween.png"""
18-05-2019T22:42:27,Ordithus,"Going somewhere, fomo?"

18-05-2019T22:43:20,BadFoMo,Nope. I'm just 'rage quiting' for a few months.
18-05-2019T22:43:35,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-keithdotdotdot:
18-05-2019T22:43:42,Ordithus,OK then
18-05-2019T22:44:17,BadFoMo,"My quiting, or the request?"
18-05-2019T22:44:22,Ordithus,The quiting
18-05-2019T22:44:46,RimaDraws,i'm just gonna keep trying myself
18-05-2019T22:44:57,Twokinds,I can't really say
18-05-2019T22:45:10,Twokinds,"Honestly, I'm often surprised what people choose"
18-05-2019T22:45:19,Twokinds,So I'm no good at guessing
18-05-2019T22:45:50,BadFoMo,So just ask again when it's time?
18-05-2019T22:46:18,Ordithus,"I like the suggestion, but the people are crazy"
18-05-2019T22:46:33,BadFoMo,Yep.
18-05-2019T22:46:56,ElvenHunter84,My next suggestion is never going to get voted for lol
18-05-2019T22:47:05,RimaDraws,you never know
18-05-2019T22:47:07,BadFoMo,What is it?
18-05-2019T22:47:14,ElvenHunter84,It's kind of a dark one
18-05-2019T22:47:19,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah I cant predict it either
18-05-2019T22:47:42,BadFoMo,"Wait, is it that Maddie and Maeve get into a fight one?"
18-05-2019T22:47:46,ElvenHunter84,yeah
18-05-2019T22:48:06,RimaDraws,i mean there were alot of good suggestions
18-05-2019T22:48:46,BadFoMo,"When in dout, cheat and pester Tom about it."
18-05-2019T22:49:28,ElvenHunter84,"Well, my Dead Keith suggestion eventually won after I tweaked it a bit"
18-05-2019T22:49:46,RimaDraws,?.?
18-05-2019T22:50:14,ElvenHunter84,but I refuse to budge on my ideas this time
18-05-2019T22:51:08,ElvenHunter84,"Are those question mark eyes because you havent seen that sketch, Rima?"
18-05-2019T22:51:28,RimaDraws,yea it is
18-05-2019T22:51:43,RimaDraws,wait which keith one?
18-05-2019T22:51:50,ElvenHunter84,"I'd link it, but the only place where I know how to easily access it is a rather explicit website"
18-05-2019T22:51:57,Ordithus,Give me a moment
18-05-2019T22:52:01,ElvenHunter84,The one where Keith straight up dies
18-05-2019T22:52:12,RimaDraws,its it the feral natani one with keith
18-05-2019T22:52:18,RimaDraws,is*
18-05-2019T22:52:28,ElvenHunter84,"no, it's from around a year ago"
18-05-2019T22:52:30,Bgrmystr2,I don't think keith was dead in that one
18-05-2019T22:52:33,ElvenHunter84,Keith gets stabbed
18-05-2019T22:52:50,RimaDraws,see i only came into the fandom a year ago
18-05-2019T22:52:59,Ordithus,The light light light
18-05-2019T22:53:00,ElvenHunter84,"And he'll get stabbed better in the sequel, Tom Willing"
18-05-2019T22:53:29,ElvenHunter84,I don't know how much Tom likes to draw the sad sketches
18-05-2019T22:54:09,RimaDraws,i wont lie they make me depressed
18-05-2019T22:54:19,RimaDraws,not yours specifically

18-05-2019T22:55:18,RimaDraws,oh that reminds me of romeo and juliet for some reason
18-05-2019T22:55:39,Ordithus,Natani lives (presumably) so it really shouldn't
18-05-2019T22:56:15,Ordithus,Though maybe Alaric would have completed the Juliet to Keith's Romeo
18-05-2019T22:56:18,Ordithus,or whatever
18-05-2019T22:56:29,RimaDraws,idk never really cared for the play
18-05-2019T22:56:37,ElvenHunter84,Or Natani would sacrifice herself to destroy the tower?
18-05-2019T22:56:58,Ordithus,"Nah, Nat x Laura"
18-05-2019T22:57:07,Ordithus,Happily ever after
18-05-2019T22:57:12,RimaDraws,i loved much ado about nothing better
18-05-2019T23:02:21,BadFoMo,"...So while I'm board- I mean we are talking about sketch requests; (I know what to request for December, but) which should I request for November?..."
