11-09-2019T13:10:22,TerraTheWizard,silly idea time
11-09-2019T13:15:02,AspiringNoodle,"Bethesda once again breaking the ""cosmetic only"" promise with their in-game atomic shop for fallout 76"
11-09-2019T13:15:13,AspiringNoodle,"They've gone full ""pay us to make the game less painful"" now"
11-09-2019T13:15:30,AspiringNoodle,$7 for a fridge to slow spoil rates of food.  $5 for robot that can scavenge supplies near your base.
11-09-2019T13:17:13,AspiringNoodle,And in other news.  Whatever I just had / have might be making a comeback.  I shall watch myself for the next few days to see if symptoms start returning
11-09-2019T13:24:16,TerraTheWizard,wasn't aware anyone was still playing 76
11-09-2019T14:25:59,SomeNiceUser,"I only hop in 76 once in a blue moon just to check out the updates, then leave since it’s still stale."
11-09-2019T14:26:26,SomeNiceUser,Can’t rewind time my friends.
11-09-2019T14:52:03,TerraTheWizard,not with that attitude
11-09-2019T15:16:46,Dadrobit,At least No Man's Sky got a happy ending.
11-09-2019T15:18:10,CrimsonQuill,Finally!

11-09-2019T15:19:39,Dadrobit,"NMS VR is mind blowing. Did get a bit motion sick after about an hour, but that's partly my fault for turning off the anti-sickness measures."
11-09-2019T15:24:15,CrimsonQuill,Hello there Dadrobit
11-09-2019T15:24:19,CrimsonQuill,How are you?

11-09-2019T15:30:38,Dadrobit,"Oof, that reminds me."
11-09-2019T15:31:09,Dadrobit,My brother was trolling on Facebook the day before Endgame released and posted a fake spoiler regarding the end of the movei.
11-09-2019T15:31:13,Dadrobit,movie*
11-09-2019T15:31:39,Dadrobit,He accidentally guessed the real ending and actually straight up spoiled the movie right before it came out.
11-09-2019T15:34:24,CrimsonQuill,Well
11-09-2019T15:34:45,CrimsonQuill,I had one or two things sadly spoiled by the internet while I was browsing Red vs Blue vids on Youtube
