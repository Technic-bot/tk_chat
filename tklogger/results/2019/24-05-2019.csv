24-05-2019T01:05:59,AspiringNoodle,You ever read a webcomic that leaves you thinking?
24-05-2019T01:06:25,AspiringNoodle,"I think I'm about to binge one that's gonna leave me thinking, ""Why did I decide to read this in its entirety?"""
24-05-2019T01:06:44,Mihari,I randomly reread all of yosh a few days ago.
24-05-2019T01:07:06,Mihari,"Well almost all, I skip the first 250 comics."
24-05-2019T01:07:15,AspiringNoodle,"So that's, what, about 2k pages?"
24-05-2019T01:07:42,Ordithus,A lot of webcomic
24-05-2019T01:07:51,ZRO4825,"lol, I always find it fun to go back and do the occasional re-read of Yosh and TK and AI."
24-05-2019T01:07:54,AspiringNoodle,"Well, I'm about to binge something similar"
24-05-2019T01:08:16,JeremySenpai,only comic I am reading atm is Komi-san and Onii-chan is done for
24-05-2019T01:08:34,AspiringNoodle,"Anyone ever read ""Jack""?"
24-05-2019T01:08:36,Mihari,"I don't think I could reread AI like I can Yosh, as weird as that is."
24-05-2019T01:09:15,Ordithus,"AI is a lot more dense than Yosh.  Plus, nostalgia?"
24-05-2019T01:09:53,Mihari,I think it's feelings and mood behind it
24-05-2019T01:11:45,AspiringNoodle,I'm probably gonna hate myself in a few days xD
24-05-2019T01:12:28,JeremySenpai,Whops 1st save in about 4 hrs
24-05-2019T01:12:31,SageSaga,Kaylin is a very flawed person with some really serious problems

24-05-2019T01:14:31,Ordithus,Set that to autosave yikes
24-05-2019T01:14:43,AspiringNoodle,"Set it to save every 5 seconds, Dark Souls style, lmao"
24-05-2019T01:14:45,SageSaga,"shes been drinking her problems away- and people think ""oh shes just a silly drunk"" instead of ""Holy crap shes getting smashed to not dwell on her situation"
24-05-2019T01:14:57,SageSaga,shes doing missions - running around- so she doesnt have time to think about it
24-05-2019T01:15:02,AspiringNoodle,"Senpai, can I has specs? :3"
24-05-2019T01:15:12,AspiringNoodle,I'm about to build a new computer very soon.

24-05-2019T01:16:25,SageSaga,also Nyna makes for a great distraction- but that still isnt healthy
24-05-2019T01:16:42,JeremySenpai,not water cooled
24-05-2019T01:17:07,JeremySenpai,it has red fins ontop i open to let the dust and hot air out
24-05-2019T01:17:18,AspiringNoodle,Cool!
24-05-2019T01:17:24,SageSaga,that doesnt sound like a beast at all

24-05-2019T01:17:42,AspiringNoodle,The CPU is probably leagues ahead of mine xD
24-05-2019T01:17:46,AspiringNoodle,I'm using a 3570k
24-05-2019T01:17:47,JeremySenpai,more like a monster
24-05-2019T01:18:12,SageSaga,it sounds... less than mine and im planning on upgrading soon XD
24-05-2019T01:18:14,JeremySenpai,i think the whole thing cost about $250 to build
24-05-2019T01:18:21,Mihari,Mine is an asus i7 overclocked to 5ghz and 128gb of ram

24-05-2019T01:23:55,Ordithus,And here I am on an itty bitty tablet pc thingamajig
24-05-2019T01:24:08,JeremySenpai,You don't need big $$$ systems to art.
24-05-2019T01:24:23,SageSaga,i do
24-05-2019T01:24:41,JeremySenpai,the screens i use cost me $30 each from ex gov auctions.
24-05-2019T01:25:05,SageSaga,what are they?

24-05-2019T01:25:22,JeremySenpai,HP LA2206x
24-05-2019T01:25:59,JeremySenpai,I want to up the screens and setup soon though. only to keep the reliability.
24-05-2019T01:26:14,AspiringNoodle,"Well, I definitely have something to think about.  This next build is also meant to double as a gaming PC.  But given how my gaming sessions have basically disappeared, that's questionable ^^;"
24-05-2019T01:26:50,JeremySenpai,Gaming rigs are overkill for art systems
24-05-2019T01:27:09,SageSaga,https://pcpartpicker.com/list/K6C96s
24-05-2019T01:27:18,SageSaga,basically the system im looking to build
24-05-2019T01:27:27,SageSaga,but waiting for some things to come out
24-05-2019T01:27:50,JeremySenpai,Oh to live in the US where pc bits are cheap
24-05-2019T01:28:08,JeremySenpai,the Prices here are stupid
24-05-2019T01:28:18,JeremySenpai,I'm Aussie btw
24-05-2019T01:28:24,AspiringNoodle,...I need to seriously reevaluate my part choices...
24-05-2019T01:28:30,AspiringNoodle,You have my sympathies.
24-05-2019T01:28:32,SageSaga,i know you are Aussie
24-05-2019T01:28:35,SageSaga,i remember O_O

24-05-2019T01:29:20,Ordithus,(yeah I know it's for your day job)
24-05-2019T01:29:30,AspiringNoodle,There's probably a LOT of places I could save money on my build.  And maybe shift some to storage
24-05-2019T01:29:36,JeremySenpai,The GPU is about the same price here for some reason though?
24-05-2019T01:29:42,AspiringNoodle,Weird
24-05-2019T01:30:22,AspiringNoodle,"Sage, make sure to get an Evo PLUS m.2"
24-05-2019T01:30:40,AspiringNoodle,"slightly better performance, same price :)"
24-05-2019T01:31:15,Bgrmystr2,"damn, that NVME is expensive"
24-05-2019T01:32:04,AspiringNoodle,Don't look at the pro models ^^;
24-05-2019T01:32:10,RazorToshiba,"That build is like, the next step up from what i have"
24-05-2019T01:32:13,Bgrmystr2,Oh I know
24-05-2019T01:32:13,JeremySenpai,needs to stop looking at pc parts
24-05-2019T01:32:43,Bgrmystr2,but $250 for 1tb is crazy.... so I can imagine the price increase is entirely from the form factor and the speed increase.
24-05-2019T01:32:54,AspiringNoodle,"I'm waiting for the next gen Zen launch, which should be in the next few months."
24-05-2019T01:33:13,Bgrmystr2,that's what I plan to replace mine with
24-05-2019T01:33:19,AspiringNoodle,"Also, that price isn't as crazy when you remember that SSDs used to cost a $1 per GB"
24-05-2019T01:33:50,Bgrmystr2,"I'm still running HDDs where I can get 3-4+ TB for what, $100 nowadays?"
24-05-2019T01:33:58,SageSaga,yeah- monday is the announcement day
24-05-2019T01:33:58,Bgrmystr2,if not more now? I haven't looked recently
24-05-2019T01:34:02,SageSaga,thats what im waiting for
24-05-2019T01:34:57,Bgrmystr2,"Man.. Ryzen 3000 my body is ready. I'm not sure if it's gonna be the end for intel for the CPU market or not, but it's gonna make them get off their ass that's for sure."
24-05-2019T01:35:23,AspiringNoodle,There was a leak suggesting a 12c processor with a 5Ghz boost
24-05-2019T01:35:33,Bgrmystr2,that's been floating around for a week bro
24-05-2019T01:35:42,Bgrmystr2,it's the same for the 16 core with 5ghz boost
24-05-2019T01:35:52,AspiringNoodle,The point being that leaks closer to a reveal / launch tend to be more accurate
24-05-2019T01:36:34,Bgrmystr2,"did you see that 16 core going toe to toe with threadripper?, 4270 score"
24-05-2019T01:36:38,Bgrmystr2,goddamn incredible
24-05-2019T01:36:46,Bgrmystr2,and they're not even final either
24-05-2019T01:36:50,AspiringNoodle,Probably a bit too rich for my blood ^^;
24-05-2019T01:37:24,AspiringNoodle,Tonight's putting some perspective back into my thoughts.  Probably gonna scale back what I buy.
24-05-2019T01:38:26,Bgrmystr2,"to be honest, you may not need as powerful of a CPU with the amount of performance you're gonna be getting out of Ryzen3000"
24-05-2019T01:38:50,Bgrmystr2,"I'm just hoping they're gonna be good price to performance as well, AMD's always been pretty good with that"
24-05-2019T01:38:53,AspiringNoodle,I'm wanting to buy a CPU that could still be relevant in 10 years
24-05-2019T01:39:20,AspiringNoodle,"To entertain potential gaming use, that means 8 core minimum since games are starting to leverage that."
24-05-2019T01:39:31,Bgrmystr2,"I don't have any plans to buy something stupidly high tier yet, it's on my to-do list, but not something I'm gonna be doing immediately."
24-05-2019T01:39:50,AspiringNoodle,I have a huge backlog of console games though.  WoW is a hell of a drug
24-05-2019T01:39:56,Bgrmystr2,"If they release a 6 core 12 thread for like $100, I'm absolutely gonna want that to replace mine"
24-05-2019T01:40:05,AspiringNoodle,That would be amazing!
24-05-2019T01:40:11,Bgrmystr2,till I can get money to afford making a nice rig
24-05-2019T01:40:22,Bgrmystr2,"but that alone would be monstrous compared to mine,"
24-05-2019T01:40:32,Bgrmystr2,since I'm still running a Phenom II 955
24-05-2019T01:40:36,AspiringNoodle,Oh my.
24-05-2019T01:40:43,Bgrmystr2,it's 4 core 4 thread from end of 2009
24-05-2019T01:41:10,Bgrmystr2,that weakest thing would destroy mine
24-05-2019T01:41:11,AspiringNoodle,Now I feel like I'm replacing my computer too soon D:
24-05-2019T01:41:20,Bgrmystr2,and I'd pay less than what I paid for my processor lol
24-05-2019T01:41:30,Bgrmystr2,"even if it's $150, it'd still be true."
24-05-2019T01:41:30,JeremySenpai,Rember to do you noodle
24-05-2019T01:41:46,JeremySenpai,take advice but do what you feel is right for you
24-05-2019T01:42:21,AspiringNoodle,I think I'm having money guilt
24-05-2019T01:42:25,Bgrmystr2,"the best thing is to watch the market see reviews and prices, and make your own decision"
24-05-2019T01:42:47,AspiringNoodle,I just really want AMD to succeed.
24-05-2019T01:42:50,Bgrmystr2,same
24-05-2019T01:42:53,AspiringNoodle,They're bringing so much power to the low end
24-05-2019T01:43:14,AspiringNoodle,"Tbh, they've completely destroyed the low end market.  It doesn't exist.  The mid-range market is the new low end."
24-05-2019T01:43:37,JeremySenpai,Thanks for the Follow DeanFox!
24-05-2019T01:44:52,AspiringNoodle,If only AMD could do the same thing for GPUs already...
24-05-2019T01:45:26,AspiringNoodle,"They're definitely a better deal at the low to mid range markets, but they aren't exactly blowing the competition out of the water like their Zen processors are."
24-05-2019T01:48:16,SageSaga,if the rumors about the new ones are true then its a competitive card
24-05-2019T01:50:43,AspiringNoodle,I was a dummy and upgraded to too high a resolution.
24-05-2019T01:50:53,SageSaga,4k?
24-05-2019T01:50:59,AspiringNoodle,"1440p is not nearly as bad as 4k, but it's still pretty demanding"
24-05-2019T01:51:16,AspiringNoodle,"To be fair though, I was using a 1280x1024 monitor for like 10 years ^^;"
24-05-2019T01:51:17,SageSaga,im running 1440p
24-05-2019T01:51:27,AspiringNoodle,Wasn't until I got to college that I realized how low rez / awful it was.
24-05-2019T01:51:47,AspiringNoodle,"Also, WoW didn't get 16:9 loading screens until Legion!"
24-05-2019T01:52:09,AspiringNoodle,Did you do benchmark research too?
24-05-2019T01:52:28,Ordithus,I'm running 2736x1824 :P
24-05-2019T01:53:15,AspiringNoodle,What... but.. how... WHAT KIND OF RESOLUTION IS THAT?!?

24-05-2019T01:53:50,Bgrmystr2,"I may only have 1080p, but I'm running four displays"

24-05-2019T01:54:14,RazorToshiba,I have 3 displays but i usually only use two at a time

24-05-2019T02:00:01,AspiringNoodle,"Let's see.  The width could increase by 2.5"" before there might be space issues.  And length... I probably have 8"" to play with."
24-05-2019T02:00:11,Bgrmystr2,that's not too bad.

24-05-2019T02:25:00,SageSaga,"man - i wish i could make a t-shirt that just had a picture of Rem and said ""Rem - Twister Champion 2018"""
24-05-2019T02:25:20,AspiringNoodle,Found the artist's page.  Let's just say there is a HUGE level of cognitive dissonance between their style and their content
24-05-2019T02:25:34,SageSaga,who?
24-05-2019T02:25:46,AspiringNoodle,"Uh, have you ever read ""Jack""? xD"

24-05-2019T02:29:46,AspiringNoodle,Well then... I guess Jack is just the level of twisted for all of you

24-05-2019T15:45:43,SpazztasticKiwi,alone can be defined as without access to help should an emergency arise. Particularly a medical one like allergy or fall
24-05-2019T15:50:01,AspiringNoodle,Anyone else use a tablet without a screen?

24-05-2019T15:58:56,SageSaga,the first one was my first cintiq and had bad colors which was a problem- eventually upgraded and got the companion- but I had to send that in for repairs
24-05-2019T15:59:18,SageSaga,so while it was in repairs for a month i bought a 13HD Touch
24-05-2019T15:59:31,SageSaga,so i could still work for that month
24-05-2019T15:59:57,SageSaga,and now i mostly use that because its hooked up to my PC

24-05-2019T16:05:47,SageSaga,yeah but this one is 4k and 16 inches
24-05-2019T16:06:22,SageSaga,which is just kinda dumb- 4k on a screen smaller than 26 inches is silly
24-05-2019T16:06:46,AspiringNoodle,"Well, if you're gonna be shoving your face into it, it makes a bit more sense ^^;"
24-05-2019T16:06:53,SageSaga,nope
24-05-2019T16:06:56,SageSaga,it doesnt
24-05-2019T16:07:26,AspiringNoodle,But I do agree that 4k might be a tad overkill.  And it probably kills battery life a smidge
24-05-2019T16:07:27,SageSaga,you can shove your face into a 1440p and you wont see a pixel at that size
24-05-2019T16:08:19,AspiringNoodle,"Okay, I think you're right on that front.  27"" 1440p monitor.  Shoved my face into it, and I can see the pixels now.  But at 1/4th the size?  Probably not."
24-05-2019T16:08:45,SageSaga,"you pretty much have to have a screen bigger than  24"" to see a pixel on a 1440p"

24-05-2019T16:24:47,Twokinds,Just kidding
24-05-2019T16:25:51,SageSaga,i was just continuing the misleading conversation for anyone who didnt know what we were talking about
24-05-2019T16:36:31,AspiringNoodle,I think I need all the eye and brain bleach on the planet...
24-05-2019T16:36:42,SageSaga,ok

24-05-2019T16:37:36,AspiringNoodle,"Let's just say I learned about a blatant plagiarist, and it was disturbing..."
24-05-2019T16:45:51,AspiringNoodle,Much better -w-
24-05-2019T16:54:06,SageSaga,almost done
24-05-2019T16:55:34,AspiringNoodle,"Dang, the stream is just as good as brain bleach, too."
24-05-2019T17:11:49,AspiringNoodle,"It really is amazing to watch a work be finished.  From sketch, to ink, to fill, to final details."
24-05-2019T17:25:21,SageSaga,and there we go
24-05-2019T17:25:37,AspiringNoodle,N-n-n-naisu <3

24-05-2019T17:26:23,Twokinds,I hate bookshelves. So much work
24-05-2019T17:26:36,SageSaga,book brushes make it easier for sure
24-05-2019T17:26:50,NibblyBot,New Comic Page: Lesson One http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/1068/
24-05-2019T17:28:12,BadFoMo,Looks good.

24-05-2019T17:29:35,BadFoMo,Bye.

24-05-2019T17:32:32,BadFoMo,"This page got a little laugh out of me, Tom. Good work."
24-05-2019T17:32:48,Azumachan,Nice page Tom.
24-05-2019T17:33:26,Bgrmystr2,"arg, woke up 3 mins ago.. was 4 mins too late to miss the end of sage's stream"
24-05-2019T17:33:28,Bgrmystr2,fff
24-05-2019T17:46:42,TerraTheWizard,nice
24-05-2019T17:48:30,Mippy,Wow...Rose is really holding a grudge against Euchre. XD (and rightly so)
24-05-2019T17:53:05,AspiringNoodle,Oh my...
24-05-2019T17:53:20,AspiringNoodle,That collar is totally abusable.
24-05-2019T18:03:46,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
24-05-2019T18:41:43,Xexanoth,..i guess that's one way to abuse the collar :P
24-05-2019T18:54:32,SpazztasticKiwi,For a second I read that as Tom having just a random hate for bookshelves like one fell on him as a child and he hadn’t forgiven them since
24-05-2019T18:54:56,Bgrmystr2,xD
24-05-2019T18:59:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Also a bucket smacked me in the face and cut my nose
24-05-2019T19:02:57,AspiringNoodle,D:
24-05-2019T19:06:29,SpazztasticKiwi,yesterday I cut some sun dried turkey for a guy and he said “I like the way you cut my meat”
24-05-2019T19:07:12,SpazztasticKiwi,either real creep dude or alien that doesn’t know how to interact with humans
24-05-2019T20:44:56,Bgrmystr2,haha to be honest I would have laughed at that
24-05-2019T21:01:15,SpazztasticKiwi,I found it
24-05-2019T21:01:19,SpazztasticKiwi,disturbing
24-05-2019T21:01:51,SpazztasticKiwi,I tried dismissing him with a bye and he just repeated it
24-05-2019T21:02:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Tomorrow I go back to the park though
24-05-2019T21:02:28,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, actually repeating it instead of trying to use it as a funny joke is disturbing territory"
24-05-2019T21:02:41,SpazztasticKiwi,My thighs and arms are still mad at me from Thursday
24-05-2019T21:02:58,SpazztasticKiwi,“Didn’t you abandon this shit in high school track?”
24-05-2019T21:23:56,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-rose:*[Now fetch me my slippers]
24-05-2019T21:24:24,AspiringNoodle,That's brilliant xD
24-05-2019T21:24:43,AspiringNoodle,A keidran ordering another [collared] keidran around.
24-05-2019T21:25:07,Ordithus,Haha slavery so funny right
24-05-2019T21:32:22,Bgrmystr2,"the funny part is the irony, ord, not the slavery :P"
24-05-2019T21:32:39,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA: Yeah! Hilarious!
24-05-2019T21:45:26,SpazztasticKiwi,That oddly reminds me of the firefly that tried seducing my lamp last night
24-05-2019T21:46:08,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock: Lampy is survived by a child?!
24-05-2019T21:53:50,SpazztasticKiwi,far as I know no childs were made
24-05-2019T21:55:06,SpazztasticKiwi,But he was having a time getting my lamps attention. It started with slow blinks and eventually he was blinking so rapidly I wonder if fireflies can be desperate
24-05-2019T21:55:29,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-MikeLewd:
24-05-2019T21:57:55,SpazztasticKiwi,somebody needs to take FNAF away from Mark
24-05-2019T22:01:24,SpazztasticKiwi,...and Bagheera is now losing his mind in the hall
24-05-2019T22:23:59,SpazztasticKiwi,"So Tom, with that progress you got done these few days, you feeling good on the headway"
24-05-2019T22:56:27,CrRAR,Goodnight y’all!
24-05-2019T22:56:37,CrRAR,"I gots a fancy new mattress, so if you don’t hear from me it’s probably cursed I’ve fallen into an eternal slumber."
24-05-2019T22:56:41,Ordithus,Night crRAR
24-05-2019T22:57:00,CrRAR,o7
24-05-2019T22:57:16,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-daydreamingkat::ctwokinds-katdryer:
24-05-2019T22:57:44,Ordithus,Enjoy your new mattress
24-05-2019T22:57:53,CrRAR,so cushy
24-05-2019T22:58:01,CrRAR,much comfort
24-05-2019T22:58:03,CrRAR,wow
24-05-2019T22:58:07,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-rose:*[It's like sleeping on nothing at all nothing at all]
24-05-2019T22:58:18,CrRAR,:ptv-ohmy:
24-05-2019T22:58:32,Ordithus,Stupid sexy... um
24-05-2019T22:59:06,CrRAR,lol
24-05-2019T22:59:11,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-ohmy:
24-05-2019T23:09:50,SpazztasticKiwi,on nothing at all or in nothing at all
24-05-2019T23:09:59,SpazztasticKiwi,one has more possibilities
24-05-2019T23:10:29,Ordithus,One does not usually sleep in a mattress
24-05-2019T23:11:24,Bgrmystr2,what if you become the mattress and sleep on yourself.. or.. sleep within yourself? Which one gives you a better night's sleep? :thinking:
24-05-2019T23:12:02,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-keithdotdotdot:
24-05-2019T23:13:08,SpazztasticKiwi,No wonder y’all are single
24-05-2019T23:13:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Missed the point entirely
24-05-2019T23:13:33,Bgrmystr2,I think my thoughts are more fun than yours. Yours are just obvious.
24-05-2019T23:13:35,Bgrmystr2,:P
24-05-2019T23:13:41,Bgrmystr2,tryin too hard
24-05-2019T23:14:00,Ordithus,Sleeping in nothing at all?
24-05-2019T23:14:10,Ordithus,Pretty common
24-05-2019T23:14:16,Bgrmystr2,exactly
24-05-2019T23:16:20,Dadrobit,"Bruh, it's mad hot even in the mornings out here. I HATE when I accidentally sleep in my clothes and end up waking in a vertiable swimming pool of sweat."
24-05-2019T23:16:33,Dadrobit,Actually the worst.
24-05-2019T23:16:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I like lace and silk as much as the next girl but just the sheets are often nicer
24-05-2019T23:17:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Particularly if there’s no one to impress
24-05-2019T23:27:34,SpazztasticKiwi,and how do you accidentally sleep in clothes
24-05-2019T23:46:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"like the guy so clueless he helps this girl fix a gutter or somethin and she offers to let him come in, have a shower and rest. Dude says nah but thanks and leaves"
24-05-2019T23:46:58,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-keifacepalm:
24-05-2019T23:48:09,Bgrmystr2,"I'm half expecting it to go the opposite way, he goes in, has a shower, chills on the couch with somethin to drink, and then goes home. Nothing happens."
24-05-2019T23:48:51,Bgrmystr2,"It's not an  for anything more, and if you expect it as such, then it just gets turned around on you."
24-05-2019T23:49:23,SpazztasticKiwi,only later does it hit him. Bless him
24-05-2019T23:49:28,Bgrmystr2,not an invitation* randomly deleted words
24-05-2019T23:49:51,Bgrmystr2,"honestly, I've known several people that same thing happened, to, and every one of em was a fuckin trap"
24-05-2019T23:50:10,Bgrmystr2,"legal issues on rape claims, every single one."
24-05-2019T23:50:39,Bgrmystr2,"two sides of the coin. Missed opportunity, or dodged a bullet."
24-05-2019T23:50:41,SpazztasticKiwi,this one the girl was talking to him the whole job - real talker
24-05-2019T23:51:43,SpazztasticKiwi,But as it is. I’m often too immediately suspicious of a guy being decent. Like “when are you gonna turn?”
24-05-2019T23:52:10,SpazztasticKiwi,So the better safe than sorry I can get
24-05-2019T23:52:15,Bgrmystr2,Don't be surprised if that guy was equally as suspicious of her being decent as well yeah. xD
24-05-2019T23:52:50,Bgrmystr2,there's a lot of crazy out there. more often than not it's better to just not even jump into it in the first place.
24-05-2019T23:53:45,SpazztasticKiwi,false claims often only make about .1% of total. The risk there is just as saucy but at least there’s not the chance of being killed
24-05-2019T23:54:16,SpazztasticKiwi,every time I see or hear jump into it I think of PhillyD
24-05-2019T23:54:35,SpazztasticKiwi,That intro will forever haunt me
24-05-2019T23:55:58,SpazztasticKiwi,My firefly is back!
