24-11-2019T12:36:59,Twokinds,I had the strangest dream...
24-11-2019T12:48:27,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
24-11-2019T12:49:06,TerraTheWizard,what was it about?
24-11-2019T12:51:58,SpazztasticKiwi,I had one few days ago
24-11-2019T12:52:10,SpazztasticKiwi,don’t remember anything besides weird
24-11-2019T12:53:16,TerraTheWizard,i had a weird one friday
24-11-2019T12:53:27,TerraTheWizard,"was hunted by an assassin with the cidename ""K"""
24-11-2019T12:53:30,TerraTheWizard,*codename
24-11-2019T12:53:34,TerraTheWizard,it was Kojima
24-11-2019T12:54:44,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m at work an hour early
24-11-2019T12:55:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"Tom, since you work on your own time, can you ever technically ever be late or early"
24-11-2019T12:56:23,Twokinds,I work overtime all the time
24-11-2019T12:56:38,Twokinds,I'm even working in my dreams
24-11-2019T12:57:31,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-clovisgirl_shake:
24-11-2019T12:57:35,Twokinds,"In my dream, I knew I'd revealed a few pages ago that Karen was actually a vampire the whole time."
24-11-2019T12:58:01,Twokinds,"Karen explained to Maddie how it happened. And in the dream, I was preparing the next page where Karen tells Maddie it has to be a secret."
24-11-2019T12:58:16,Twokinds,XD
24-11-2019T12:58:36,Twokinds,"Even in my dreams, I'm writing comic pages. They just don't make sense."
24-11-2019T12:58:57,TerraTheWizard,"what a twist though, lol"
24-11-2019T12:59:02,iliar,"Hehe. You reminded me of how one day I had a dream, how I was tormented by insomnia all night."
24-11-2019T12:59:05,iliar,"In the morning there was a strange feeling when you seemed to sleep, but you still have a feeling that you were deceived in something."
24-11-2019T13:02:02,SpazztasticKiwi,oh yes perfect strategy
24-11-2019T13:02:09,SpazztasticKiwi,tell Maddie a secret
24-11-2019T13:02:28,SpazztasticKiwi,even better: let it be Karen that knows first
24-11-2019T13:02:37,SpazztasticKiwi,what could go wrong
24-11-2019T13:03:33,iliar,"But in my opinion it’s good when the dreams are obviously crazy. Much worse when dreams are realistic. I had problems several times when I didn’t do something, just because I did it. In a dream."
24-11-2019T13:03:42,iliar,But when I woke up I did not understand that it was a dream and now I need to do it again.
24-11-2019T13:04:10,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA: kiwi
24-11-2019T13:04:21,SpazztasticKiwi,am I wrong tho
24-11-2019T13:04:36,iliar,I think Maddie can keep secrets.
24-11-2019T13:05:53,SpazztasticKiwi,I now remember what I was gonna tell dadro yesterday
24-11-2019T13:08:18,iliar,"For example, we still don't know how old she actually is. Although she mentioned her age several times, I’m not sure which number is correct."
24-11-2019T13:08:23,iliar,And did she ever call her real age.
24-11-2019T13:09:40,SpazztasticKiwi,maybe she forgot
24-11-2019T13:18:28,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
24-11-2019T13:25:54,SpazztasticKiwi,"like last year, they’re putting out a coffee table for black friday"
24-11-2019T13:27:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"because what crowds of overhyped, borderline volitile people need is caffeine"
24-11-2019T13:48:14,WhataboutRoxy,stream ?
24-11-2019T13:49:46,WhataboutRoxy,to know if i stay or not
24-11-2019T14:08:10,Twokinds,Is it free?
24-11-2019T14:08:13,Twokinds,I appreciate free coffee
24-11-2019T14:08:33,Twokinds,"That's what I loved most about Korea. Every place you went to, they offer small cups of free coffee."
24-11-2019T14:33:17,tehbear,how do you take your coffee?
24-11-2019T14:35:28,Twokinds,I like my coffee sweet
24-11-2019T15:27:20,SpazztasticKiwi,yeah it’s free
24-11-2019T15:27:38,SpazztasticKiwi,sugar and cream optional far as I know
24-11-2019T15:27:55,SpazztasticKiwi,and decaf  - lots of older folks get it
24-11-2019T15:28:20,SpazztasticKiwi,you’d have an awful long drive for just some free coffee tho Tom
24-11-2019T15:44:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom likes his coffee so that he gets his money’s worth from a dentist visit
24-11-2019T15:55:44,TerraTheWizard,"""i like coffee in my sugar"""

24-11-2019T19:12:06,IronHorseComics,"well more specifically lighting, I get shading, it's the highlights that throw me off"
24-11-2019T19:19:59,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve had a need for lasagna for awhile so now I have it for lunch
24-11-2019T19:23:31,JojoF2415,Coffee without sugar is good and 92% dark chocolate
24-11-2019T19:45:53,Dadrobit,Got myself a couple bags o' cherries. Gonna make that cobbler for the Thanksgiving feast.
24-11-2019T19:46:05,SpazztasticKiwi,how’s DS
24-11-2019T19:46:43,Dadrobit,Haven't played it in the last week because work. Still mid chapter 3. But I really freaking like it a lot.
24-11-2019T19:47:14,Dadrobit,Find myself thinking about it and wishing I could just sneak my Playstation in to work or shrug off my weekend duties.
24-11-2019T19:48:03,Dadrobit,The gameplay loop really just ticks all my boxes. But I get why people wouldn't like it. S'kinda like enjoying No Man's Sky.
24-11-2019T19:48:16,Dadrobit,(Which I also adore)
24-11-2019T19:50:39,SpazztasticKiwi,you know about the pee tip?
24-11-2019T19:50:48,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s not what it insinuates
24-11-2019T19:51:32,Dadrobit,"I read somewhere that you can pee on BT's, but I was unsuccessful."
24-11-2019T19:55:36,Dadrobit,I did get a pretty excellent picture out of it though.
24-11-2019T19:55:57,Dadrobit,You get a screenshot of the moment you earn a trophy on PS4.
24-11-2019T19:56:11,Dadrobit,"And the first time you pee outside, you get a trophy"
24-11-2019T19:56:23,Dadrobit,And the first time I tried was in a battle against a BT
24-11-2019T19:56:51,Dadrobit,So there's this giant ass tar squid monster barreling towards Norman Reedus who's just there taking a leak.
24-11-2019T20:00:21,SpazztasticKiwi,yeah that’s the thing
24-11-2019T20:00:28,SpazztasticKiwi,it spoils the BTs
24-11-2019T20:00:38,SpazztasticKiwi,spooks
24-11-2019T20:01:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Seán did it - though you should see the clip from when I finds out it’s a thing in the game
24-11-2019T20:01:19,SpazztasticKiwi,“I can pee? How do I pee?!”
24-11-2019T20:02:21,Dadrobit,"Yeah, in hindsight, I shoulda tried it out on the minor guys. I can however confirm that it does not work on the big bodd fight BT's."
24-11-2019T20:02:29,Dadrobit,boss*
24-11-2019T20:02:53,SpazztasticKiwi,yeah he was being attacked so he used that moment to test it
24-11-2019T20:03:24,SpazztasticKiwi,the goop retreats and the bts in a small radius retreats
24-11-2019T20:50:24,AspiringNoodle,"""IT SECRETS A GOLDEN LIQUID.  DO NOT ATTACK. DO NOT ATTACK!"""
24-11-2019T21:15:00,JojoF2415,i learned today is to not eat a potato raw.
24-11-2019T21:23:18,Dadrobit,A majority of the danger in any potato (but raw moreso) comes from the fact that potatos are a form of nightshade.
24-11-2019T21:24:00,Dadrobit,A majority of the toxins are in the skin though.
24-11-2019T21:24:14,Dadrobit,So skinned potatos are far less dangerous.
24-11-2019T21:24:58,Dadrobit,"Though worst case scenario, even fully raw green potatos are really only going to cause an upset stomach. Might put you in the bathroom for a while."
24-11-2019T21:25:16,JojoF2415,I ate a piece of a skinned chopped potato
24-11-2019T21:27:01,JojoF2415,It tastes like a worse version of Jicama

24-11-2019T23:18:04,JojoF2415,I wonder how foxy from fnaf would look like in Twokinds art style
24-11-2019T23:20:50,AspiringNoodle,Genderbent with bigger knockers than Flora? :P
24-11-2019T23:22:24,JojoF2415,What?
24-11-2019T23:23:32,JojoF2415,One of my biggest fears right now is dying 90%+ in god eater geometry dash
24-11-2019T23:24:25,JojoF2415,God eaters easy I mean. God eater is too hard
24-11-2019T23:58:44,AspiringNoodle,Just watched LTT's new video on Intel's 10th gen.  The marketing behind it made him so made they had to censor out swears
