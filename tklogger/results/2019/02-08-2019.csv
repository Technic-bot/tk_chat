02-08-2019T00:49:08,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
02-08-2019T00:49:15,Sclimshady,Lets see it
02-08-2019T00:49:23,HeresyArtStream,The first big comic that I was super serious about wanting to draw was a stupid ninja comic.
02-08-2019T00:49:33,Sclimshady,XD
02-08-2019T00:49:38,HeresyArtStream,"And I was like ""it's about ninjas in modern times but MINE IS DIFFERENT!"""
02-08-2019T00:49:40,DarthRexKing,"That was my thought too, Heresy."
02-08-2019T00:49:42,w0lfmare,Very competitive field
02-08-2019T00:49:50,unsteddyphoenix,Their mistake was sending MULTIPLE ninjas
02-08-2019T00:50:00,Dadrobit,Like... A stupid ninja? Or the comic itself was stupid. Because I'd read something about a stupid ninja.
02-08-2019T00:50:02,unsteddyphoenix,If they sent just one you wouldve died
02-08-2019T00:50:02,HeresyArtStream,It was basically just me regurgitating all the pop culture I was into when I was a teenager. :V
02-08-2019T00:50:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Dad check discord
02-08-2019T00:50:28,SpazztasticKiwi,if you know there’s ninjas in a comic are they good ninjas
02-08-2019T00:50:31,HeresyArtStream,"And that comic never got made because I was afraid of scewing it up, but really it was just crap. :V"
02-08-2019T00:50:56,HeresyArtStream,"And then I was like ""I have to do a practice comic first, one that I am not afraid of screwing up!"""
02-08-2019T00:51:00,RimaDraws,i did a stupid little story with friends for fun out of randomness

02-08-2019T00:51:07,Mihari,templars*
02-08-2019T00:51:10,HeresyArtStream,And then I ended up liking that one so much more that I forgot all about the ninja stuff.

02-08-2019T00:53:57,RimaDraws,i do too and i dont like to admit i am a weeb
02-08-2019T00:54:01,HeresyArtStream,"Just remember Kameloh: every story is about someone who wants something, and is having trouble getting it."

02-08-2019T00:55:10,Sclimshady,I watch it on my lunch break sometimes
02-08-2019T00:55:13,HeresyArtStream,"Also, idea trees are a handy trick I learned in animation school. Just grab a paper and a pencil, start writing down ideas and then drawing lines to connect them together like a crazy conspiracy theorist. :V"
02-08-2019T00:55:15,RimaDraws,i absolutely loved sailor moon sclim! who was your fav

02-08-2019T00:55:47,Sclimshady,Tuxedo mask was my favorite because he is totally useless
02-08-2019T00:55:49,HeresyArtStream,"Your main idea is in the middle. You draw a circle around it and then keep adding ideas around it to grow the ""tree."""
02-08-2019T00:55:56,RimaDraws,well the reboot is way better
02-08-2019T00:55:59,HeresyArtStream,(and draw circles around those)
02-08-2019T00:56:04,Sclimshady,Like he literally does nothing
02-08-2019T00:56:12,RimaDraws,i grew up on the original but hes actually useful in the reboot
02-08-2019T00:56:23,Sclimshady,He just throws a dang rose and runs away
02-08-2019T00:56:25,SpazztasticKiwi,speaking of reboots the new Fruits Basket should be up today

02-08-2019T01:03:50,FloofyCat,"Yeah, it was."
02-08-2019T01:03:51,Bgrmystr2,your trauma was also amazing

02-08-2019T01:04:08,SpazztasticKiwi,“doesn’t work out for you”? Why - you’re unconscious most of the time anyway

02-08-2019T01:04:18,HeresyArtStream,The amount of time it would take me to draw one issue of a comic book would be similar to the amount of time it would take to make a minute of animation. x.x

02-08-2019T01:05:59,HeresyArtStream,"Although the amount of time it takes to do animation can be very inconsistent, too. If it was 1 minute of unique cell animations at 24 FPS that could take a year."

02-08-2019T02:37:36,HeresyArtStream,The furry community started out as a sci-fi and anime fanclub.
02-08-2019T02:37:49,HeresyArtStream,Hence why there's so much crossover between the furry fandom and those fandoms...
02-08-2019T02:37:57,Sclimshady,"What, I did't notice"
02-08-2019T02:39:25,Twokinds,Oh. No

02-08-2019T11:49:05,CrimsonQuill,"I'll miss tomorrow's sketch stream anyhow, which is a pity."
02-08-2019T11:49:06,SomeNiceUser,You beat me to it Rima lol
02-08-2019T11:49:19,RimaDraws,its not a matter of beating someone
02-08-2019T11:49:25,CrimsonQuill,But I brought my TK volumes with me to read. :)
02-08-2019T11:49:35,CrimsonQuill,And I have my drawing stuff.
02-08-2019T11:50:59,CrRAR,excellent
02-08-2019T11:51:07,SomeNiceUser,"Nice, you will be able to draw TK stuff, if you truly want to."
02-08-2019T11:51:09,IronHorseComics,"Hey Rima, Crimson"
02-08-2019T11:51:24,SomeNiceUser,Hi horse.
02-08-2019T11:51:25,IronHorseComics,and Snu Snu
02-08-2019T11:51:36,SomeNiceUser,:ptv-condescending:
02-08-2019T11:51:39,CrRAR,haha
02-08-2019T11:51:45,CrimsonQuill,@RimaDraws Could you please explain Mad Moxxi to me? I am afraid to look at it.
02-08-2019T11:52:05,CrimsonQuill,Because the only characters from Borderlands I know of are Claptrap and Tiny Tina.
02-08-2019T11:52:09,IronHorseComics,"it's about a girl named Moxxi, and she's angry"
02-08-2019T11:52:45,SomeNiceUser,"She owns a bar at Sanctuary, and she got big boobs."
02-08-2019T11:53:05,CrimsonQuill,Oooookkkkkk....
02-08-2019T11:53:15,SomeNiceUser,"Well, it’s true."
02-08-2019T11:53:17,CrimsonQuill,Rima? Pic synopsis?
02-08-2019T11:53:20,CrRAR,go onnnn
02-08-2019T11:53:51,CrimsonQuill,@RimaDraws because I'm afraid to actually look at it from the description....
02-08-2019T11:54:34,CrimsonQuill,Or...should I leave it?
02-08-2019T11:54:42,CrimsonQuill,"You know what, I'll leave it."
02-08-2019T11:54:45,CrimsonQuill,Never mind.
02-08-2019T11:54:47,CrimsonQuill,Sorry Rima.
02-08-2019T11:54:55,SomeNiceUser,That’s a good idea.
02-08-2019T11:55:11,CrimsonQuill,"Change the subject someone, please"
02-08-2019T11:55:16,CrimsonQuill,I did a Red
02-08-2019T11:55:22,CrimsonQuill,'Keep diggin' that hole'
02-08-2019T11:56:10,SomeNiceUser,What would be a great character? Got any idea on how they look and behave.
02-08-2019T11:56:13,SomeNiceUser,?
02-08-2019T11:56:20,CrimsonQuill,Umm...
02-08-2019T11:56:32,IronHorseComics,well that depends
02-08-2019T11:56:37,CrimsonQuill,"Well, if you know anyone else who has an OC, Imagine conversations between the,"
02-08-2019T11:56:40,CrimsonQuill,them.
02-08-2019T11:56:42,IronHorseComics,what kind of character are you looking for?
02-08-2019T11:56:47,CrimsonQuill,Bounce them off of each other.
02-08-2019T11:56:55,CrimsonQuill,Develop their personalities a bit.
02-08-2019T11:57:04,CrimsonQuill,"Whatever happens, they need to feel alive."
02-08-2019T11:57:17,CrimsonQuill,Like they have their own lives..
02-08-2019T11:57:41,IronHorseComics,and their character design should complement said personalities
02-08-2019T11:58:20,CrimsonQuill,"For example, my character Thomas Bailey is a leader-he's tall, and carries himself with an air of authority."
02-08-2019T11:58:43,CrimsonQuill,"But has a friendly persona to other people, and so his face is not too sharp..."
02-08-2019T11:59:03,CrimsonQuill,Something like that.
02-08-2019T11:59:14,RimaDraws,sorry was busy
02-08-2019T11:59:19,CrimsonQuill,"(I am still a bit bad at creating characters, but I hope it helps)"
02-08-2019T11:59:32,CrimsonQuill,"@RimaDraws it's ok, I've decided to leave it."
02-08-2019T11:59:36,RimaDraws,oh okay
02-08-2019T11:59:43,CrimsonQuill,It's best that way.
02-08-2019T12:00:20,CrimsonQuill,"(I will say though, I really like some of the Sabrina Spellman and other art you draw, you are quite talented.)"
02-08-2019T12:00:46,RimaDraws,oh thank you. i am trying my best to improve
02-08-2019T12:00:48,CrimsonQuill,SomeNiceUser is asking for advice on character design
02-08-2019T12:00:59,CrimsonQuill,And we're trying to give a few ideas
02-08-2019T12:00:59,IronHorseComics,"my character Suzuki Keiji is the funny man, he usually carries a smile on his face and even though he often wears charcoal shirts he's still very friendly"
02-08-2019T12:01:20,CrimsonQuill,@IronHorseComics :ptv-victory::ptv-right:
02-08-2019T12:01:27,CrimsonQuill,Nice.
02-08-2019T12:01:30,SomeNiceUser,"How about a lone magic user in a secluded place just developing new formulae, content about themselves, occasionally getting lonely, so they go to a near village to trade and attempt to socialize."
02-08-2019T12:01:35,RimaDraws,i'd say stay away from the mary sues of character making aka tragic backstory and such and making everyone like your character
02-08-2019T12:02:00,RimaDraws,i mean be creative in making your character as well as do your research when using actual places if using them
02-08-2019T12:02:05,CrimsonQuill,Hmmm...I'll bear that in mind for my one.
02-08-2019T12:02:56,RimaDraws,yea please for the love of all that is story making and character design stay away from mary sue /stu traits
02-08-2019T12:03:49,IronHorseComics,"or if you make a mary sue, use it to make fun of the mary sue chracters"
02-08-2019T12:03:57,RimaDraws,yea really
02-08-2019T12:04:01,RimaDraws,do that but please dont use them in a story
02-08-2019T12:04:21,CrimsonQuill,Now I need to ask for advice
02-08-2019T12:04:22,IronHorseComics,"also don't make your characters Goku, nobody should be THAT stupid with that much ""power"""
02-08-2019T12:04:34,RimaDraws,well i like goku
02-08-2019T12:04:37,RimaDraws,so
02-08-2019T12:04:37,CrimsonQuill,What flaws could I use to offset a good leader with friendly personality?
02-08-2019T12:04:43,CrimsonQuill,And a good hold on emotions?
02-08-2019T12:04:45,RimaDraws,uhh....let me see
02-08-2019T12:04:46,SomeNiceUser,We can just use them for filling spots for a untimely death.
02-08-2019T12:04:53,CrimsonQuill,Just I'm struggling to give him some flas.
02-08-2019T12:04:54,IronHorseComics,there
02-08-2019T12:04:57,CrimsonQuill,Flaws.
02-08-2019T12:05:06,CrimsonQuill,And I worry that he shouldn't really be a paragon.
02-08-2019T12:05:16,RimaDraws,a good leader with a friendly personality has control on their emotions but sometimes it is okay to let go
02-08-2019T12:05:17,SomeNiceUser,Paragon?
02-08-2019T12:05:17,IronHorseComics,*There's a youtube channel that covers tropes including the five man band
02-08-2019T12:05:29,CrimsonQuill,@RimaDraws good point....
02-08-2019T12:05:38,RimaDraws,you cant be perfect all the time
02-08-2019T12:05:42,CrimsonQuill,@IronHorseComics Overly Sarcastic Productions? Love that channel.
02-08-2019T12:05:43,RimaDraws,take rimara for example.
02-08-2019T12:06:01,CrimsonQuill,"@RimaDraws So, for example, maybe the stress gets to him and he lashes out at someone?"
02-08-2019T12:06:10,RimaDraws,she is friendly but a leader of sorts but sometimes its hard for her to keep under control all the time
02-08-2019T12:06:23,CrimsonQuill,That is helpful.
02-08-2019T12:06:41,RimaDraws,not everyone who is a leader has complete control but it is good to keep emotions in check
02-08-2019T12:07:16,CrimsonQuill,Ok.
02-08-2019T12:07:34,CrimsonQuill,A sort of 'bottle up for later eruption' thing?
02-08-2019T12:07:37,IronHorseComics,"Superman in the Bruce Timm Justice league is a great example of a flawed paragon. He wants to help people first and foremost, yet because he knows how powerful he is he finds it hard to accept help from others out of fear that they would get hurt..."
02-08-2019T12:07:48,IronHorseComics,when he thinks he could do everything himself
02-08-2019T12:07:54,CrimsonQuill,I see.
02-08-2019T12:08:08,RimaDraws,i mean bottling up isnt good but i would say lets go of those emotions when they are alone
02-08-2019T12:08:26,CrimsonQuill,...I could figure out how to do that...
02-08-2019T12:08:36,CrimsonQuill,(research intensifies)
02-08-2019T12:08:50,CrimsonQuill,I'm kind of basing him of Jorge from Halo Reach.
02-08-2019T12:09:11,RimaDraws,its not bad to base a character off another but make the traits your own
02-08-2019T12:09:15,RimaDraws,make them unique
02-08-2019T12:09:15,IronHorseComics,and yes I took that analysis from Overly Sarcastic Productions
02-08-2019T12:09:20,CrimsonQuill,Oh definitely.
02-08-2019T12:09:27,SomeNiceUser,"Here’s a scenario: a Mary Sue character who is supposedly is perfect and is very egotistic gets beaten is a fair fight. Their skill slowly degrades due to being blind by bottled up emotions, and eventually, they snap, for best or for the worst."
02-08-2019T12:09:31,CrimsonQuill,He has my tendancy to talk.
02-08-2019T12:09:55,CrimsonQuill,"@SomeNiceUser So, SCP-682 finally being killed?"
02-08-2019T12:10:08,RimaDraws,that sounds so bad
02-08-2019T12:10:12,RimaDraws,not to be mean
02-08-2019T12:10:13,CrimsonQuill,Because that SCP seems to be a bit mary-sueish as of late.
02-08-2019T12:10:15,RimaDraws,but its funny bad
02-08-2019T12:10:18,CrimsonQuill,XD
02-08-2019T12:12:16,RimaDraws,i like funny bad
02-08-2019T12:13:30,SomeNiceUser,"Yeah, you’re right about that, it is funny when I look at it again."
02-08-2019T12:13:49,SomeNiceUser,:ptv-laugh:
02-08-2019T12:14:00,CrimsonQuill,"Well, I'm going to head."
02-08-2019T12:14:07,SomeNiceUser,Head?
02-08-2019T12:14:18,CrimsonQuill,I'm going to leave for a bit.
02-08-2019T12:14:33,RimaDraws,i have to go to the gym soon if i want my sweet treat on my cheat day
02-08-2019T12:14:33,CrimsonQuill,I'll either pop by later in the evening or tomorrow.
02-08-2019T12:14:34,SomeNiceUser,"Oh alright, see ya Quill!"
02-08-2019T12:14:41,CrimsonQuill,Cheerio guys!

02-08-2019T12:18:01,AspiringNoodle,"Then Tucca and Bertie, and then be pissed off at Netflix for not renewing for another season"
02-08-2019T12:18:17,RimaDraws,"i already watched all of that, she ra season 3, wentworth season 7, and now i am finishing miraculous lady bug season 3 part 1"
02-08-2019T12:18:23,RimaDraws,i finished tuca and bertie

02-08-2019T12:18:52,AspiringNoodle,I binged all of OPM season 2 in like 2 days xD
02-08-2019T12:19:06,AspiringNoodle,And I'm disappointed / psyched that it didn't wrap up the conflict :D
02-08-2019T12:19:09,RimaDraws,"i am currently waiting on the walking dead season 9, fuller house season 5, and disenchantment season 2"
02-08-2019T12:19:26,SomeNiceUser,I’m just here with a phone.
02-08-2019T12:19:30,RimaDraws,i am also watching lucifer

02-08-2019T12:20:42,AspiringNoodle,I think I stopped after season 3
02-08-2019T12:20:49,RimaDraws,i hope they bring out a new season for the dragon prince
02-08-2019T12:21:15,SomeNiceUser,"I’ve watched it, but I’ve lost interest in it."
02-08-2019T12:21:25,AspiringNoodle,Here's what I'm REALLY waiting on :P
02-08-2019T12:21:33,AspiringNoodle,"G.skill to launch their new ram, god dammit"
02-08-2019T12:21:40,SomeNiceUser,Why was the show addictive?
02-08-2019T12:21:45,RimaDraws,what show
02-08-2019T12:21:49,AspiringNoodle,Dragon Prince
02-08-2019T12:22:04,RimaDraws,i find it interesting because the same people who made avatar the last air bender made this
02-08-2019T12:22:35,RimaDraws,its also kinda funny
02-08-2019T12:22:42,AspiringNoodle,Rima
02-08-2019T12:22:43,RimaDraws,but i am a kid at heart for a 31 year old
02-08-2019T12:22:59,RimaDraws,i am guilty of loving cartoons
02-08-2019T12:22:59,AspiringNoodle,How gaudy is this ram? https://www.newegg.com/g-skill-32gb-288-pin-ddr4-sdram/p/N82E16820232806?Description=3600%20cl16&cm_re=3600_cl16-_-20-232-806-_-Product
02-08-2019T12:23:12,AspiringNoodle,"Also, curse you Newegg and your ridiculously long url schema"
02-08-2019T12:23:21,AspiringNoodle,"Like, da fuq is this"
02-08-2019T12:23:22,RimaDraws,what the hell is that lol
02-08-2019T12:23:26,RimaDraws,it looks like...
02-08-2019T12:23:35,RimaDraws,one of those fancy file folders
02-08-2019T12:23:59,AspiringNoodle,Don't let the colors confuse you.  That's just the standard rainbow barf to show off the argb
02-08-2019T12:24:05,RimaDraws,oh wow
02-08-2019T12:24:16,SomeNiceUser,It looks nice though.
02-08-2019T12:24:17,AspiringNoodle,And it's quite literally the only 32GB kit of 3600 CL16 ram available
02-08-2019T12:25:02,RimaDraws,it does
02-08-2019T12:25:23,RimaDraws,OOOH ALL MY PARTS FOR MY PC BUILD WENT DOWN
02-08-2019T12:25:27,AspiringNoodle,"I've been waiting for this, though.  Cheaper, looks better imo.  And G.skill STILL hasn't put it out for sale. Link inc. HIT THE DECK"
02-08-2019T12:25:29,RimaDraws,yessss!
02-08-2019T12:25:30,AspiringNoodle,https://www.newegg.com/g-skill-32gb-288-pin-ddr4-sdram/p/N82E16820232862?Description=3600%20cl16&cm_re=3600_cl16-_-20-232-862-_-Product
02-08-2019T12:25:46,SomeNiceUser,Hope it’s the best price for what you need.
02-08-2019T12:26:02,RimaDraws,yea it is but i need to raise the money too plus get a software of windows
02-08-2019T12:26:10,RimaDraws,so thats about 600$ for a good pc build
02-08-2019T12:26:13,AspiringNoodle,Windows so pricey
02-08-2019T12:26:23,AspiringNoodle,$140 for the USB with both 32 and 64-bit
02-08-2019T12:26:30,RimaDraws,yea it is but im just getting regular windows not pro
02-08-2019T12:26:37,AspiringNoodle,As am I ;)
02-08-2019T12:26:54,SomeNiceUser,Pro takes up more ram
02-08-2019T12:27:14,RimaDraws,yea good thing im getting just regular windows 10
02-08-2019T12:27:15,AspiringNoodle,My computer is going to be pretty much a workstation that will work mostly as a gaming computer for now
02-08-2019T12:27:39,AspiringNoodle,"3700x, 2070 super, 2TB gen 4 M.2"
02-08-2019T12:27:53,SomeNiceUser,I’m probably going to just buy that laptop when it’s on sale.
02-08-2019T12:28:18,AspiringNoodle,"This thing, in total, will still probably be around $2600 - $2800"
02-08-2019T12:28:30,SomeNiceUser,"Damn, that’s a lot."
02-08-2019T12:28:31,RimaDraws,oh my
02-08-2019T12:28:47,AspiringNoodle,https://pcpartpicker.com/list/dDBqKB
02-08-2019T12:28:49,SomeNiceUser,:ptv-ohmy: it’s so expensive...
02-08-2019T12:29:24,AspiringNoodle,"Yes, the cooler is overkill.  But I will, in all likelihood, upgrade my processor down the line."
02-08-2019T12:29:39,AspiringNoodle,"And if I go 12 - 16 cores, then it'll be a perfect fit."
02-08-2019T12:31:16,SomeNiceUser,"I wonder if you can make a computer overkill, in price and in performance."
02-08-2019T12:31:19,AspiringNoodle,"If Orthonox were here, they could help with bringing the price down a smidge"
02-08-2019T12:31:26,AspiringNoodle,"The answer is yes, lol"
02-08-2019T12:31:55,AspiringNoodle,Buy a $500 full-tower with support for 12+ fans
02-08-2019T12:32:28,AspiringNoodle,"Get an intel 9980XE and Z399 mobo, 64 GB of RAM, SLI two 2080 TI's (titans if you need nearly double the ram)"
02-08-2019T12:33:06,AspiringNoodle,"And then go full custom liquid cooling loop.  Two of them.  One of the GPUs, one of the CPU."
02-08-2019T12:33:20,AspiringNoodle,for*
02-08-2019T12:33:52,SomeNiceUser,:ptv-uneasy:
02-08-2019T12:34:55,AspiringNoodle,"I could go more expensive, but 1) I don't feel comfortable going more expensive (I think I got too good at saving) and 2) The price-to-performance isn't there"
02-08-2019T12:35:16,SomeNiceUser,Ah.
02-08-2019T12:35:21,AspiringNoodle,The 2060 and 2070 supers from Nvidia got a very nice boost in performance of 14 - 15%
02-08-2019T12:35:29,AspiringNoodle,The 2080 super only got a boost of 8 - 9%
02-08-2019T12:35:38,SomeNiceUser,Is there a laptop with an amd core?
02-08-2019T12:35:52,AspiringNoodle,The original bump proposition was a 40/25% increase to cost/performance
02-08-2019T12:35:59,AspiringNoodle,The supers knocked that down to 40/15%
02-08-2019T12:36:29,AspiringNoodle,"So if you're looking for bang per buck, the original 2080 was a better proposition, but now the 2070 super is better"
02-08-2019T12:36:46,SomeNiceUser,Good tip.
02-08-2019T12:37:35,AspiringNoodle,"That said, unless you have a g-sync monitor, need the raytracing or AI cores, or plan to stream using NVENC, compare Nvidia's cards to AMD's new navi cards"
02-08-2019T12:38:01,AspiringNoodle,"I have a g-sync monitor, so I'm kinda locked to Nvidia until I can buy a freesync"
02-08-2019T12:39:01,AspiringNoodle,"Not to mention I RMA'd it earlier this year, so now I have a new monitor that's under a year old, sooooooooo xD"
02-08-2019T12:40:09,RimaDraws,man critical role is so funny
02-08-2019T12:40:12,SomeNiceUser,I heard that AMD is great for running multiple programs at a time.
02-08-2019T12:40:27,AspiringNoodle,Definitely
02-08-2019T12:40:39,AspiringNoodle,"In the streaming space, AMD is the winner atm"
02-08-2019T12:41:05,SomeNiceUser,AMD it is then.
02-08-2019T12:41:07,AspiringNoodle,"While Intel is still the crowned king for performance overall, the moment you try to stream with it, it takes huge hits to framerate"

02-08-2019T12:41:46,AspiringNoodle,I think optimum tech did a comparison of the 3900x and 9900k
02-08-2019T12:42:13,RimaDraws,hi azuma
02-08-2019T12:42:24,SomeNiceUser,Hi azuma
02-08-2019T12:42:27,AspiringNoodle,Both cpus are capable using the h.264 fast preset (I think the 9900k only lagged a fraction of frames in a single test)
02-08-2019T12:42:56,AspiringNoodle,"And while the Intel CPU still had higher average FPS by a slight margin, it also had larger frametime spikes"
02-08-2019T12:43:31,AspiringNoodle,"But forget medium and above, the 9900k TANKED in those scenarios, dropping and lagging frames like a mofo"
02-08-2019T12:44:02,AspiringNoodle,"It makes me wonder what the 3700x is like, though.  Everyone loves talking about the 3900x, but nobody wants to talk about its cheaper, same price-to-performance cousin :c"
02-08-2019T12:45:12,AspiringNoodle,"At the very least, it should be able to handle the fast preset flawlessly"
02-08-2019T12:46:21,SomeNiceUser,This conversation is very interesting.
02-08-2019T12:46:59,AspiringNoodle,I'm too obsessed with hardware
02-08-2019T12:47:02,AspiringNoodle,Help me. PLEASE.
02-08-2019T12:47:08,SomeNiceUser,no
02-08-2019T12:47:13,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-whiny:
02-08-2019T12:47:32,SomeNiceUser,"now, what about software?"

02-08-2019T12:47:43,AspiringNoodle,F*ck adobe ;D
02-08-2019T12:48:12,SomeNiceUser,What’s wrong with adobe?
02-08-2019T12:48:31,AspiringNoodle,They've gotten too comfortable
02-08-2019T12:49:19,SomeNiceUser,:ptv-wondering:
02-08-2019T12:49:21,AspiringNoodle,The whole reason they switched to a subscription model (which more or less squeezes out MORE money than the suites ever did) is because they can't innovate anymore.
02-08-2019T12:49:51,SomeNiceUser,So th
02-08-2019T12:50:12,AspiringNoodle,"Photoshop is arguable.  I think it's still $10 a month thanks to that particular package, but you either pay $20 per month per app, or $50 per month for the whole suite"
02-08-2019T12:51:58,SomeNiceUser,Hmm.
02-08-2019T12:52:19,SomeNiceUser,Too expensive.
02-08-2019T12:52:52,AspiringNoodle,"On the bright side, because there's demand for non-extortiony software, competitors have been rising up :)"
02-08-2019T12:53:54,SomeNiceUser,"Now, I wonder what competition rose up?"
02-08-2019T12:54:17,AspiringNoodle,"Well, if you're interested purely in drawing and nothing else, Clip Studio Paint is perfectly viable"
02-08-2019T12:54:30,AspiringNoodle,"$50 normally, but goes on sale multiple times a year.  I got mine for $25"
02-08-2019T12:54:57,SomeNiceUser,That’s great. I’ll put that on my list.
02-08-2019T12:54:58,AspiringNoodle,"If you want a photoshop alternative, there's Affinity Photo"
02-08-2019T12:55:19,AspiringNoodle,$50.  They also have Designer and Publisher (illustrator and InDesign respectively)
02-08-2019T12:55:25,SomeNiceUser,Photoshop is nice too.
02-08-2019T12:55:48,SomeNiceUser,The alternative seems promising too.
02-08-2019T12:56:11,AspiringNoodle,"For Premiere, there's Da Vinci Resolve and Sony Vegas"
02-08-2019T12:58:09,AspiringNoodle,"I'll be honest.  If Adobe had a system where you subscribe to an app for so many months, then you get to keep the latest version that was available, I'd be perfectly happy"
02-08-2019T12:58:26,AspiringNoodle,"But no, they want you to be permanently subbed, or no access :/"
02-08-2019T12:58:37,AspiringNoodle,Welcome to the cancer that is software as a service
02-08-2019T12:59:25,SomeNiceUser,"So that’s why people find alternatives, or even pirate software."
02-08-2019T13:00:01,AspiringNoodle,The Adobe suite is great in a lot of respects
02-08-2019T13:00:19,SomeNiceUser,Just expensive.
02-08-2019T13:00:21,AspiringNoodle,"Like the fact that they have a complete ecosystem where you can do pretty much anything you can think of, and then share files between everything flawlessly"
02-08-2019T13:00:29,AspiringNoodle,But the company itself is a douchenozzle
02-08-2019T13:01:01,AspiringNoodle,"They're the industry standard, they know they are.  They know people are more or less going to be FORCED to use their software to do anything professionally"
02-08-2019T13:01:13,AspiringNoodle,"And as such, they can do and charge w/e they want."
02-08-2019T13:02:33,SomeNiceUser,"That’s why competitors rise, to provide alternatives to adobe."
02-08-2019T13:02:42,AspiringNoodle,"Oh yeah, I forgot to mention"
02-08-2019T13:02:54,SomeNiceUser,:ptv-wondering:
02-08-2019T13:03:02,AspiringNoodle,"I think that $20 a month pricetag is if you sub for a whole year, where you can either pay $240 up front or $20 a month over 12 months"
02-08-2019T13:03:06,AspiringNoodle,Otherwise it's $30 a month
02-08-2019T13:03:28,SomeNiceUser,:ptv-shock:
02-08-2019T13:04:04,AspiringNoodle,Can confirm
02-08-2019T13:04:18,SomeNiceUser,"Ima nope out of Adobe right now, since it’s too much for my wallet."
02-08-2019T13:04:27,AspiringNoodle,$20.99 per month for annual plan
02-08-2019T13:04:39,AspiringNoodle,$239.88 if all at once
02-08-2019T13:04:50,AspiringNoodle,$31.49 per month on a monthly basis
02-08-2019T13:05:11,AspiringNoodle,And Photoshop is still $10 a month if you just need that
02-08-2019T13:05:38,AspiringNoodle,"But that is on an annual basis, there is no per-month option"
02-08-2019T13:05:43,SomeNiceUser,About 350$ a year.
02-08-2019T13:06:07,AspiringNoodle,"So yeah, Adobe has gotten really extortionate :/"
02-08-2019T13:06:08,SomeNiceUser,360$*
02-08-2019T13:06:47,CrRAR,"Yeah, subscription plans need to die."
02-08-2019T13:07:25,SomeNiceUser,As well as Microtransactions.
02-08-2019T13:07:40,AspiringNoodle,Do what I do
02-08-2019T13:07:45,AspiringNoodle,Make a f*ck list :D
02-08-2019T13:07:55,SomeNiceUser,yes
02-08-2019T13:07:58,AspiringNoodle,xD
02-08-2019T13:08:16,CrRAR,"Sadly yeah, like microtransactions and their lucrative nature, businesses will pay subscriptions because they have no other choice, perpetuating them."

02-08-2019T13:09:08,CrRAR,Oh cool.
02-08-2019T13:09:14,AspiringNoodle,"It probably won't last forever, but if it helps establish them as a competitor, I'm all for it"

02-08-2019T13:13:59,SomeNiceUser,I will be waiting for that day.
02-08-2019T13:14:11,AspiringNoodle,"Trust me, it'll happen"
02-08-2019T13:14:26,AspiringNoodle,"Adobe got it's start with InDesign, which was designed to dethrone the current publishing software at the time"
02-08-2019T13:14:52,AspiringNoodle,That company became what adobe is now.  And Adobe innovated to compete
02-08-2019T13:15:50,SomeNiceUser,"Yup, that’s terrible."

02-08-2019T13:17:35,SomeNiceUser,Kinda of a coincidence.
02-08-2019T13:19:29,SomeNiceUser,"But yeah, it has to stop someday."

02-08-2019T14:29:59,ZRO4825,She makes up for it with panties-less booty though.
02-08-2019T14:30:10,SageSaga,she'd cut me for less
02-08-2019T14:30:31,AspiringNoodle,Ofc she's make up for it with dat ass xD
02-08-2019T14:33:30,ZRO4825,Gotta give her something besides *just* a cute face to work with. :P

02-08-2019T14:44:17,ZRO4825,"Well, yes, but actually not always..."
02-08-2019T14:44:43,AspiringNoodle,"Yeah yeah yeah, everywhere has problems, even 'Murica"

02-08-2019T14:51:01,SomeNiceUser,Do you guys want to know to say “She has a nice rack” in French?
02-08-2019T14:51:14,SomeNiceUser,:ptv-condescending:
02-08-2019T14:51:15,SageSaga,nope- that's rude
02-08-2019T14:51:46,SomeNiceUser,Yeah...
02-08-2019T14:51:54,ZRO4825,"30 years down the road, Japan has adopted Toyoko as slang for boobies. Sage is in the ancient corners of the internet going ""HA! CALLED IT!"""
02-08-2019T14:52:15,SomeNiceUser,:ptv-snicker:
02-08-2019T14:53:46,ZRO4825,Only politics we should ever discuss is Epic Rap Battle of History. That's fun politics.
02-08-2019T14:54:11,SomeNiceUser,Oui.
02-08-2019T14:54:19,SageSaga,and less than 30 minutes the backgrounds are done
02-08-2019T14:54:24,SageSaga,im making good time today!
02-08-2019T14:54:37,SomeNiceUser,That was fast.
02-08-2019T14:55:30,BadFoMo,Cool!
02-08-2019T14:55:56,NextGenAnubisKid,Excellent work! :D
02-08-2019T14:57:20,SageSaga,i like this vocalist
02-08-2019T14:57:29,SomeNiceUser,Do you want to have anything nice translated into French?
02-08-2019T14:58:12,SomeNiceUser,"Yeah, it’s nice..."
02-08-2019T14:58:53,IronHorseComics,30 minutes to do a background? you using a brush?
02-08-2019T14:59:20,SageSaga,everyone uses brushes to paint?
02-08-2019T14:59:33,SpazztasticKiwi,brushie brushie
02-08-2019T15:00:00,SomeNiceUser,Brushie!
02-08-2019T15:00:29,IronHorseComics,"well, I suppose. I hadn't been able to find good foilage brushes since I built the new PC some years ago"
02-08-2019T15:00:58,SageSaga,there are lots of them out there and when that fails ya make your own
02-08-2019T15:01:11,IronHorseComics,yeah making brushes is NOT my strong suit
02-08-2019T15:01:23,SomeNiceUser,It’s raining pretty hard right now... had to close the windows.
02-08-2019T15:01:25,IronHorseComics,I've only done it once and it looks terrible
02-08-2019T15:01:41,SageSaga,gotta tweak em to make em work right
02-08-2019T15:02:21,SageSaga,i tweak all my brushes- i have several of the same brushes that are all tweaked a bit for different things
02-08-2019T15:02:45,SomeNiceUser,I love this song!
02-08-2019T15:03:18,SomeNiceUser,It’s pretty lively!
02-08-2019T15:03:52,SageSaga,it's from Black Clover- black Clover has a ton of good music
02-08-2019T15:03:59,SageSaga,which is weird
02-08-2019T15:04:28,SomeNiceUser,"That’s something, huh?"
02-08-2019T15:04:52,SageSaga,Black Clover is an anime that has a lot of problems- and is just really fun
02-08-2019T15:05:49,NextGenAnubisKid,Will add it to my list ^^
02-08-2019T15:05:56,SomeNiceUser,Same.
02-08-2019T15:06:46,SageSaga,it has some of the worse Animation errors ive ever seen- and then- it pulls off some of the most interesting fight scenes ive seen in a while
02-08-2019T15:07:22,AspiringNoodle,"SageSaga, you ever watch CinemaSins?"
02-08-2019T15:07:25,NextGenAnubisKid,I will keep that in mind XD
02-08-2019T15:07:36,ZRO4825,"So, what you're saying, Sage, is that it failed successfully? lol"
02-08-2019T15:07:59,SageSaga,yes Noodle
02-08-2019T15:08:08,AspiringNoodle,Do that with Black Clover :P
02-08-2019T15:08:10,SageSaga,and Zro- it didnt really fail because -
02-08-2019T15:08:16,AspiringNoodle,Rip them a new one for every error you find! lol
02-08-2019T15:08:18,SomeNiceUser,This is going to be a treat.
02-08-2019T15:08:31,SageSaga,"while the start is rough and you are like ""This is like just bad Magic Naruto"""
02-08-2019T15:08:56,SageSaga,once it gets into it- the pacing is better than any other Shonen action series
02-08-2019T15:10:06,SageSaga,"it's like ""Oh no! A terrible bad guy thats going to kill us all!"" ""Ah they are going to get beat- escape- build up and then fight  again-"" ""LETS PULL OFF SOME AWESOME TEAM WORK AND SCREW HIM UP!"" ""huh? holy crap- they did it-"""
02-08-2019T15:10:08,NextGenAnubisKid,Noted ^^
02-08-2019T15:10:12,AspiringNoodle,Anyone here ever watch Quan Zhi Gao Shou?
02-08-2019T15:10:21,NextGenAnubisKid,I have not
02-08-2019T15:10:26,SomeNiceUser,"This song, BNHA op2?"
02-08-2019T15:10:28,AspiringNoodle,Do it!
02-08-2019T15:10:29,SageSaga,"""Ok! Lets go after the next big bad guy in like 5 episodes!"" ""Wait- what?!"""
02-08-2019T15:11:05,SomeNiceUser,I know this song is Peace sign.
02-08-2019T15:11:10,SageSaga,its pretty fast paced which is awesome- you get to more cool fight scenes- so much that you can tell they add a ton of filler because the fight scenes are so much work XD
02-08-2019T15:11:32,AspiringNoodle,We talking Evangelion elevator levels of filler? lol
02-08-2019T15:11:38,SageSaga,This song is from My Hero Academia season 2
02-08-2019T15:12:00,AspiringNoodle,"Also, Tiger & Bunny is pretty great :D"
02-08-2019T15:12:21,AspiringNoodle,"Lots of action and drama.  I'm sad it only got 1 season, but it did wrap up its plot pretty well"
02-08-2019T15:12:24,SageSaga,that elevator was not really filler- it was purposeful and not to just extend the timer
02-08-2019T15:12:46,SomeNiceUser,I’m waiting for My Hero Acadamia season 4.
02-08-2019T15:12:57,AspiringNoodle,"I know, I know.  It's just fun to poke fun at the fact that it was over a minute of a still shot xD"
02-08-2019T15:15:56,MatyMaty,Hey Sage
02-08-2019T15:16:00,MatyMaty,and everyone o/
02-08-2019T15:16:04,BadFoMo,Yo.

02-08-2019T15:17:37,AspiringNoodle,All day.  Every day.
02-08-2019T15:17:46,MatyMaty,"oh, anime"
02-08-2019T15:17:48,AspiringNoodle,;_;
02-08-2019T15:17:49,MatyMaty,that reminds me
02-08-2019T15:17:53,MatyMaty,"Guess what, Sage"
02-08-2019T15:18:06,MatyMaty,that Iskai mom anime is even worse of what I feared :P
02-08-2019T15:18:11,MatyMaty,"er, isekai"
02-08-2019T15:18:24,NextGenAnubisKid,Am doing well! Just a little sleepy
02-08-2019T15:18:27,SageSaga,yeah i know
02-08-2019T15:18:38,SageSaga,it's pretty bad so far
02-08-2019T15:18:56,MatyMaty,I hoped they would avoid the mom/son fanservice but NOPE
02-08-2019T15:19:03,SageSaga,and is getting more and more incest-y
02-08-2019T15:19:08,MatyMaty,yeaaah
02-08-2019T15:19:11,IronHorseComics,"no see, it's Norman Bates the anime"
02-08-2019T15:21:03,NextGenAnubisKid,Oh well
02-08-2019T15:21:08,NextGenAnubisKid,Guess I'll remove that one from my list.
02-08-2019T15:21:41,AspiringNoodle,"I can't remember if I have that one on my list, lol"
02-08-2019T15:21:56,MatyMaty,I'm waiting for a Dark Souls style isekai where everything is terrible
02-08-2019T15:22:19,NextGenAnubisKid,Isn't that Goblin Slayer? Or am I mistaken?
02-08-2019T15:22:22,AspiringNoodle,And nobody explains everything and you have to pay attention to dialogue / background details to get the lore? :P
02-08-2019T15:22:23,MatyMaty,Huh
02-08-2019T15:22:26,MatyMaty,That's true
02-08-2019T15:22:30,NextGenAnubisKid,"(Haven't seen that one either, full disclosure)"
02-08-2019T15:22:33,MatyMaty,That would be Goblin Slayer
02-08-2019T15:22:50,MatyMaty,"Lol, noodle"
02-08-2019T15:23:01,SageSaga,https://twitter.com/paeses/status/1130926542056509440
02-08-2019T15:23:03,AspiringNoodle,Mother's Basement did a teardown of how awful the rape scene within the first few episodes was absolutely horrible from a cinematography perspective
02-08-2019T15:23:15,MatyMaty,"that or the ""The Hero and his Elven Bride open a pizza parlor in another world"" anime"
02-08-2019T15:23:15,SageSaga,was looking for one of these to show y'all
02-08-2019T15:23:34,NextGenAnubisKid,Oh nice Sage ^^
02-08-2019T15:23:46,MatyMaty,oooh wow
02-08-2019T15:24:08,SageSaga,for how often these fight scenes happen- they do a great job with them on their budget
02-08-2019T15:24:23,SomeNiceUser,So many animes that catches my eye.
02-08-2019T15:25:07,NextGenAnubisKid,I feel that User
02-08-2019T15:25:20,AspiringNoodle,Seriously
02-08-2019T15:25:23,AspiringNoodle,Tiger & Bunny :P
02-08-2019T15:25:24,NextGenAnubisKid,I'm waiting for an empty weekend/roommate to move out so I can just binge all the anime XD
02-08-2019T15:27:11,SageSaga,"""Dragonball Z"" ""Ok in a few weeks we need that 1 minute fight scene, so get working on it now."" Black Clover - ""OK! We have 15 fight scenes in the next 16 episodes! We are extending it to 19 episodes for some filler so you all dont die! You might still-"""
02-08-2019T15:27:40,AspiringNoodle,Tiger & Bunny is about a world in which people are born with powers and are called NEXT (Noted Entities with eXtraordinary Talents)
02-08-2019T15:27:54,SageSaga,yep Tiger and Bunny is pretty good
02-08-2019T15:28:13,AspiringNoodle,Those few with powers that are actually useful can become corporate sponsored super heroes who compete with other heroes on live television to stop crimes
02-08-2019T15:28:26,NextGenAnubisKid,I'll check that one out ^^
02-08-2019T15:28:47,SageSaga,it's not as good as it used to be
02-08-2019T15:28:52,SageSaga,because they took out all the Ads
02-08-2019T15:29:04,AspiringNoodle,It's pretty damn cool because there's a REALLY dark backstory / plot to the show
02-08-2019T15:29:15,AspiringNoodle,Oh no... they took out Pepsi? ;_;
02-08-2019T15:29:35,SageSaga,the girl is still in it obviously but its no longer obviously Pepsi sponsor
02-08-2019T15:29:43,AspiringNoodle,Brb
02-08-2019T15:29:47,AspiringNoodle,Gonna go murder some people
02-08-2019T15:29:49,SageSaga,they took all the advertisements out
02-08-2019T15:30:02,AspiringNoodle,That's utterly ridiculous
02-08-2019T15:30:11,AspiringNoodle,It all had to be licensed when the show was made
02-08-2019T15:30:16,AspiringNoodle,Why the hell would they pull everything
02-08-2019T15:30:48,SageSaga,"kinda like how in Jojo you hear them call out their Stand and you hear them say ""SPICE GIRL!"" but the subs says ""Spicy Lady"" XD"
02-08-2019T15:31:00,AspiringNoodle,-_-
02-08-2019T15:31:18,SomeNiceUser,Kono Dio da!
02-08-2019T15:31:23,AspiringNoodle,I'd be okay with these massive corporations going out of business and their trademarks being up for grabs
02-08-2019T15:31:36,AspiringNoodle,GIVE ME BACK THE UNDERAGE ICE LADY WITH PEPSI SPONSORS
02-08-2019T15:32:00,SageSaga,shes still in it- shes just not drinking Pepsi anymore
02-08-2019T15:32:07,AspiringNoodle,And that's what pisses me off
02-08-2019T15:32:12,RedDragonSyndicate,Hey man
02-08-2019T15:32:16,SageSaga,yo Red!

02-08-2019T15:35:08,AspiringNoodle,looks like Hulu's version may still be untainted
02-08-2019T15:35:41,SageSaga,maybe but more people have Netflix than Hulu
02-08-2019T15:35:50,AspiringNoodle,Just putting it out there
02-08-2019T15:36:25,AspiringNoodle,I wouldn't be so pissed at hulu / funimation if hulu was multinational
02-08-2019T15:36:30,SageSaga,jeez- i wonder what anime this song is from
02-08-2019T15:37:20,MatyMaty,no idea

02-08-2019T15:37:34,SageSaga,they literally yelled the name of the anime XD

02-08-2019T15:39:50,SageSaga,so i wasnt sure if it was described or not
02-08-2019T15:39:59,AspiringNoodle,"So if it was deleted, I wouldn't know :ptv-laugh:"
02-08-2019T15:40:02,SageSaga,and Noodle- that doesnt matter- im streaming - my rules
02-08-2019T15:40:06,MatyMaty,"It said ""wow I gotta share this"" or something like that :P"
02-08-2019T15:40:12,MatyMaty,no desc
02-08-2019T15:41:15,SageSaga,if it's deleted it should remove it on toms stream too
02-08-2019T15:41:20,IronHorseComics,yeah I'm also here on Tome's link so what'cha gonna do
02-08-2019T15:41:31,AspiringNoodle,"Nope, still up here <3"
02-08-2019T15:41:35,TeapotOfDoom,Evening
02-08-2019T15:41:43,AspiringNoodle,And those flames are peak realism~
02-08-2019T15:41:49,SomeNiceUser,The chats are all linked up Sage.
02-08-2019T15:42:01,SageSaga,wrong apparently User
02-08-2019T15:42:13,SageSaga,they changed the chats they are no longer linked properly
02-08-2019T15:42:17,TeapotOfDoom,Tom squad activated lol
02-08-2019T15:42:26,AspiringNoodle,Testing from Sage's stream
02-08-2019T15:42:27,TeapotOfDoom,Are they?
02-08-2019T15:42:34,SageSaga,y'all do know im a mod on Toms channel right?
02-08-2019T15:42:46,SomeNiceUser,Yup.
02-08-2019T15:42:53,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-shock:*[NO WAAAAAAY!]
02-08-2019T15:42:59,TeapotOfDoom,I'm on sages stream and sometimes the sub symbol for tom is there sometimes not
02-08-2019T15:43:00,SageSaga,it used to be if i banned you it would ban you on mine and his
02-08-2019T15:43:21,MatyMaty,It no longer works that way?
02-08-2019T15:43:23,SageSaga,it also used to delete messages from both
02-08-2019T15:43:25,TeapotOfDoom,:hammer: :ctwokinds-nataniAAAAshake:
02-08-2019T15:43:38,SageSaga,and no it doesnt- well it doesnt delete history
02-08-2019T15:43:56,SageSaga,the message you posted that Maty deleted was deleted - but not if they already saw it
02-08-2019T15:43:56,MatyMaty,that sounds too complicated
02-08-2019T15:44:04,TeapotOfDoom,Picarto be broken
02-08-2019T15:44:12,SageSaga,Here- I am going to delete this message
02-08-2019T15:44:12,AspiringNoodle,^ What else is new?
02-08-2019T15:44:33,NextGenAnubisKid,Don't even get me started on Picarto for Android XD
02-08-2019T15:44:33,SageSaga,now- who sees that message as deleted?
02-08-2019T15:44:40,IronHorseComics,I do
02-08-2019T15:44:41,AspiringNoodle,*raises noodle*
02-08-2019T15:44:43,MatyMaty,it is gone at Toms
02-08-2019T15:44:45,SomeNiceUser,“Such powerful magic!”
02-08-2019T15:44:49,MatyMaty,is still here in yours
02-08-2019T15:44:58,SageSaga,exactly- now refresh the page
02-08-2019T15:45:00,NextGenAnubisKid,"Still here in Sage's stream, yeah"
02-08-2019T15:45:14,MatyMaty,its gone
02-08-2019T15:45:18,SageSaga,see?
02-08-2019T15:45:23,TeapotOfDoom,Hahaha
02-08-2019T15:45:28,IronHorseComics,"yeah, it's vanished"
02-08-2019T15:45:30,TeapotOfDoom,Picarto an android
02-08-2019T15:45:31,MatyMaty,I would think this has to be an error
02-08-2019T15:45:38,NextGenAnubisKid,"Huh, interesting"
02-08-2019T15:45:39,SageSaga,yeah i think it is
02-08-2019T15:45:48,SageSaga,i dont have time to report it though atm
02-08-2019T15:45:56,TeapotOfDoom,I'm using it right now i know what you mean anubis
02-08-2019T15:46:02,SageSaga,we had that troll show up last night
02-08-2019T15:46:16,TeapotOfDoom,He hopped acc tho
02-08-2019T15:46:24,SageSaga,i deleted all his messages and banned him- yet his messages were still up on Toms
02-08-2019T15:46:25,Bgrmystr2,mornin
02-08-2019T15:46:38,NextGenAnubisKid,Allo BGR
02-08-2019T15:46:40,TeapotOfDoom,Mornin bgr
02-08-2019T15:46:40,MatyMaty,which one? the anti anthro one?
02-08-2019T15:46:41,NextGenAnubisKid,There was a troll last night?
02-08-2019T15:46:43,SageSaga,yeah
02-08-2019T15:46:51,TheOtherEric,Playing old streams still isnt working 😩
02-08-2019T15:46:52,TeapotOfDoom,Yeah that one
02-08-2019T15:46:52,SageSaga,heres the thing
02-08-2019T15:46:55,Bgrmystr2,"I'm going to note that refreshing sage's page makes the message disappear entirely while leaving it there just simply says ""This message was removed"""
02-08-2019T15:47:07,SageSaga,when he showed up I turned on the 14 day registered user option
02-08-2019T15:47:10,IronHorseComics,let's not bring john Carpenter into this
02-08-2019T15:47:17,IronHorseComics,aw man I wasn't fast enough for that joke
02-08-2019T15:47:27,SageSaga,but he was able to come in with new accounts anyways-
02-08-2019T15:47:33,MatyMaty,geez
02-08-2019T15:47:37,SageSaga,so i think he was on Toms and was bypassing mine
02-08-2019T15:47:43,NextGenAnubisKid,Oh wow
02-08-2019T15:47:44,Bgrmystr2,"they were probably already pre-made, sage"
02-08-2019T15:47:47,Bgrmystr2,if I had to guess
02-08-2019T15:47:54,Bgrmystr2,it's not like he hasn't been harassing streamers for years now
02-08-2019T15:47:55,NextGenAnubisKid,Some people just don't have anything better to do with their time I guess
02-08-2019T15:47:59,SageSaga,they were but do you think he makes them 2 weeks ahead?
02-08-2019T15:48:12,SageSaga,and even if they did- then they could only do it every 2 weeks
02-08-2019T15:48:36,SomeNiceUser,Abandoned/hacked accounts? Although it’s very unlikely.
02-08-2019T15:48:39,Bgrmystr2,I mean.. he probably just has 20 or 30 accounts just hanging around.
02-08-2019T15:48:52,Bgrmystr2,that he made months prior
02-08-2019T15:48:57,Bgrmystr2,that he uses to harass people with
02-08-2019T15:49:00,MatyMaty,hacking Picarto accounts for trolling sounds like a waste of time
02-08-2019T15:49:01,TeapotOfDoom,Probably. Not a problem with a vpn and a password manager
02-08-2019T15:49:18,AspiringNoodle,Douchebags gonna douche
02-08-2019T15:49:24,IronHorseComics,I've seen enough troll accounts
02-08-2019T15:49:28,TeapotOfDoom,Yeah
02-08-2019T15:49:37,IronHorseComics,not on TwoKinds but rather on Blazbaros' streams
02-08-2019T15:49:37,AspiringNoodle,"Unless you make it physically impossible for them to do it, they'll spend their time being aholes :/"
02-08-2019T15:49:58,TeapotOfDoom,Just annoying
02-08-2019T15:49:59,SageSaga,the 14 day thing is new so i doubt he was prepared for it
02-08-2019T15:50:05,SageSaga,but Tom probably doesnt have it turned on
02-08-2019T15:50:16,Bgrmystr2,ah
02-08-2019T15:50:26,MatyMaty,Mmmmm that would explain
02-08-2019T15:50:35,MatyMaty,a thing I saw not long ago
02-08-2019T15:50:39,TeapotOfDoom,To be honest I'm kinda surprised it's only one guy tho
02-08-2019T15:50:43,BadFoMo,Back. What are we talking about?
02-08-2019T15:50:50,MatyMaty,Chalo had his stream set as SFW but was in a multi with NSFW people
02-08-2019T15:51:01,MatyMaty,yet he still showed up in the front page
02-08-2019T15:51:08,TeapotOfDoom,Troll on yesterdays stream fomo
02-08-2019T15:51:25,MatyMaty,"IIRC when you had a multi with someone marked as NSFW, all streams in the multi were marked as such too?"
02-08-2019T15:51:27,TeapotOfDoom,Kept harassing people
02-08-2019T15:51:37,BadFoMo,Must have been while I was asleep.
02-08-2019T15:51:48,Bgrmystr2,"I don't recall that being the case in the past 4 years I've used picarto, Maty :thinking:"
02-08-2019T15:51:52,SageSaga,and when i tell y'all to not talk about the troll - dont talk about it ok? He's there because he wants yall to talk about him
02-08-2019T15:52:00,BadFoMo,Blast my need/love of sleep.
02-08-2019T15:52:05,NextGenAnubisKid,Gotcha Sage
02-08-2019T15:52:07,TeapotOfDoom,It was about 11am for me which corresponds to 5am eastern
02-08-2019T15:52:23,SageSaga,and Maty that was how it was but now it will just block them out and make you agree to view them instead
02-08-2019T15:52:33,MatyMaty,aaah
02-08-2019T15:53:00,TeapotOfDoom,Ey cap
02-08-2019T15:53:56,SomeNiceUser,"My doggo is just chilling with me, cute pup."
02-08-2019T15:54:20,AspiringNoodle,*wants pet* *house not suitable for one* *forever alone*
02-08-2019T15:54:36,NextGenAnubisKid,Dawwwwww X3
02-08-2019T15:54:41,NextGenAnubisKid,I may get a cat at some point
02-08-2019T15:54:46,TeapotOfDoom,Me too
02-08-2019T15:54:50,TeapotOfDoom,I want
02-08-2019T15:54:52,SomeNiceUser,"Get a pet rock Noodle, that works."
02-08-2019T15:54:56,TeapotOfDoom,Lol
02-08-2019T15:55:12,TeapotOfDoom,Step 2: win a race with said rock
02-08-2019T15:55:38,NextGenAnubisKid,Get a USB powered Pet Rock while you're at it :P
02-08-2019T15:55:38,TeapotOfDoom,Step 3: ?
02-08-2019T15:55:44,IronHorseComics,worked so well for Patrick
02-08-2019T15:55:50,TeapotOfDoom,Step 4: profit.
02-08-2019T15:56:11,IronHorseComics,step 5 is wait for the rock to grow up and then live under it for the rest of your life
02-08-2019T15:56:15,SomeNiceUser,Get a pet hard drive.
02-08-2019T15:56:22,TeapotOfDoom,Lol
02-08-2019T15:56:43,TeapotOfDoom,"Mine's pure wd red, whats yours?"
02-08-2019T15:57:11,SomeNiceUser,Now you would be able to bring it around and play with it!
02-08-2019T15:57:44,IronHorseComics,"*WARNING! STEP 5 MAY RESULT IN LAZINESS, PERPETUAL STUPIDITY, AND LIVING NEXT TO A GROUCHY NEIGHBOR WHO CAN'T PLAY A CLARINET! Rock owners be advised"""
02-08-2019T15:57:57,AspiringNoodle,^ This man gets it
02-08-2019T15:58:09,AspiringNoodle,*talks about wanting to be a professional musician*
02-08-2019T15:58:27,AspiringNoodle,"*has no talent, skill, whatever you want to call it and sucks balls at playing clarinet*"
02-08-2019T15:58:37,TeapotOfDoom,More like thinking he is
02-08-2019T15:59:10,AspiringNoodle,"Me: ""Give me 1 year, and I'll play a clarinet so well you'll look like an amatuer."""
02-08-2019T15:59:29,IronHorseComics,unless you look at the one episode where Spongebob replaces one part in the mouthpiece of said clarinet and the player actually sounds good with it
02-08-2019T16:01:04,TeapotOfDoom,i actually can't remember that episode
02-08-2019T16:01:11,TeapotOfDoom,is it a later one?
02-08-2019T16:01:51,IronHorseComics,I think it's season 4 or 5. it's the one where he's trying to have the best day ever and everything goes wrong
02-08-2019T16:02:24,IronHorseComics,it's the one for that best day ever song comes from...even though it actually appeared before that in the closing credits of the first movie
02-08-2019T16:03:48,TeapotOfDoom,dunno
02-08-2019T16:04:20,TeapotOfDoom,i really don't know where my knowledge of the series ends. I'm a walking lexicon for the first three seasons i think
02-08-2019T16:04:38,TeapotOfDoom,or at least most of the episodes
02-08-2019T16:04:57,TeapotOfDoom,but sadly only in german so won't be of much use here
02-08-2019T16:05:22,ZRO4825,"Am cleaned up for work now. Now the only question is, to bother braiding my ponytail or not."
02-08-2019T16:07:04,TeapotOfDoom,to braid or not to braid
02-08-2019T16:07:14,ZRO4825,"Indeed, lol"
02-08-2019T16:07:58,TeapotOfDoom,that is the question
02-08-2019T16:10:05,TeapotOfDoom,I'm gonna watch Mei to Koneko Bus
02-08-2019T16:10:13,TeapotOfDoom,Later y'all
02-08-2019T16:10:19,NextGenAnubisKid,See ya Teapot!
02-08-2019T16:10:23,NibblyBot,New Patreon Post: Kathrin's Introduction https://www.patreon.com/posts/kathrins-28894528
02-08-2019T16:10:39,TeapotOfDoom,It's only 15min long so won't be gone long
02-08-2019T16:10:41,TeapotOfDoom,also neat
02-08-2019T16:11:58,IronHorseComics,oooooohhhh
02-08-2019T16:12:02,IronHorseComics,that page looks good
02-08-2019T16:12:34,NextGenAnubisKid,It really does ^^
02-08-2019T16:15:25,Orthonox,Tom's killing it with backgrounds this week.
02-08-2019T16:16:34,TeapotOfDoom,i can't find a good version of the film damn
02-08-2019T16:16:43,TeapotOfDoom,also the page lookds amazing
02-08-2019T16:17:07,SageSaga,thanks! . . . oh wait
02-08-2019T16:17:20,IronHorseComics,"sorry sage, got a visit from the nibbly bot"
02-08-2019T16:17:32,SageSaga,i know i was making a joke
02-08-2019T16:17:48,NextGenAnubisKid,XD
02-08-2019T16:17:52,TeapotOfDoom,"since we're appearently redoing introductions, how about redoing page 1 and 2?"
02-08-2019T16:17:55,IronHorseComics,welp
02-08-2019T16:18:02,TeapotOfDoom,well sage
02-08-2019T16:18:39,IronHorseComics,"if I would redo a page, it would be the one where Shawa is first introduced. Maybe for my birthday next March"
02-08-2019T16:18:41,TeapotOfDoom,to be fair the latest comic page of ai also looks amazing also her face looks hillarious after nynas comment
02-08-2019T16:19:23,NextGenAnubisKid,It does ^^
02-08-2019T16:19:33,NextGenAnubisKid,AI's given me a lot of outfit ideas actually XD
02-08-2019T16:19:38,IronHorseComics,may I link the page in question Sage?
02-08-2019T16:19:57,SageSaga,?
02-08-2019T16:20:25,SageSaga,the rules are simple- you can post any SFW links so long as you describe it first
02-08-2019T16:20:41,TeapotOfDoom,"say, does anyody have a good source to watch anime? i can't seem to find mei to koneko bus online..."
02-08-2019T16:20:42,IronHorseComics,"I mentioned that if I would redo a page in Fluffy 500, it would be where the character Shawa is introduced"
02-08-2019T16:20:51,SageSaga,and if its a link to official Twokinds of Yosh/AI stuff you can post it regardless
02-08-2019T16:21:18,IronHorseComics,I was gonna share the page in question to give people some context
02-08-2019T16:21:26,TeapotOfDoom,gimme
02-08-2019T16:21:36,IronHorseComics,http://fluffy500.thecomicseries.com/comics/6
02-08-2019T16:21:39,IronHorseComics,here you go
02-08-2019T16:22:49,IronHorseComics,it was back when I drew and inked the comics on paper and then colored it digitally
02-08-2019T16:26:26,IronHorseComics,"the biggest problem I had, aside from the problem with inking with real pens/india ink in general, was scanning the pages"
02-08-2019T16:26:51,SageSaga,lot of people used cheap and bad scanners back then
02-08-2019T16:27:24,IronHorseComics,"word of the wise, never buy a scanner/printer combo from Brother, their scanners autocrop something fierce, even when they're set to the page size of the paper"
02-08-2019T16:27:26,SageSaga,not sure how long ago the comic is from but high end scanners arent super common
02-08-2019T16:27:46,IronHorseComics,that page was from two years ago
02-08-2019T16:28:04,SageSaga,yep- scanners havent improved much unless ya get a high end one
02-08-2019T16:28:08,IronHorseComics,the 2nd anniversary is a couple months away
02-08-2019T16:28:22,TeapotOfDoom,scanners and printers are the black magic of computer science
02-08-2019T16:28:41,TeapotOfDoom,they are amazingly bad
02-08-2019T16:28:44,SageSaga,old trick was to draw on cardstock or Bristol board- and put a black outline around the board or put black construction paper behind it
02-08-2019T16:28:47,AspiringNoodle,I didn't know Patrick got a role in your comic :P
02-08-2019T16:28:47,IronHorseComics,"thing is, the HP one I had didn't have that problem, it was just a crappy printer"
02-08-2019T16:29:15,SageSaga,"that way the scanning software would see black and think ""This is where the scan stats"""
02-08-2019T16:29:20,SageSaga,starts*
02-08-2019T16:29:36,TeapotOfDoom,we've got a really high end one in our office from lexmark and even that is crap
02-08-2019T16:29:51,IronHorseComics,"wish I knew that back then, would have saved me a lot of headaches and rage"
02-08-2019T16:29:56,TeapotOfDoom,cost us somewhere in the tens of thousands i think
02-08-2019T16:30:18,SageSaga,wat
02-08-2019T16:30:30,TeapotOfDoom,printers are a blatant money grab
02-08-2019T16:30:34,TeapotOfDoom,like hardcore
02-08-2019T16:30:52,TeapotOfDoom,wasted 3 hours trying to print something from my laptop on the weekend
02-08-2019T16:31:19,SageSaga,i bought high end color laser printers for one of my old workplaces- they were only like 300-1k
02-08-2019T16:31:21,TeapotOfDoom,not happening for the printer
02-08-2019T16:31:36,TeapotOfDoom,it's a business grade one
02-08-2019T16:31:44,SageSaga,great for printing flyers and pamphlets
02-08-2019T16:31:51,TeapotOfDoom,the size of a whole desk from the floor up
02-08-2019T16:32:20,SageSaga,sounds like a photocopy machine not just a printer scanner
02-08-2019T16:32:45,TeapotOfDoom,it can fold and staple paper it's amazing
02-08-2019T16:33:03,TeapotOfDoom,but it cant open pdfs and print them normally from a usb drive
02-08-2019T16:33:05,SageSaga,yeah those arent anything like just a printer/scanner
02-08-2019T16:33:21,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Page looking good sage
02-08-2019T16:33:26,SageSaga,thanks
02-08-2019T16:33:35,NextGenAnubisKid,Very much so ^^
02-08-2019T16:33:49,TeapotOfDoom,it scaled them down to quarter the size and some pdfs gave an error when trying to open
02-08-2019T16:34:15,TeapotOfDoom,why did the company spend 30k for something that cnt even open pdfs
02-08-2019T16:34:35,SageSaga,honestly- sounds like operator error to me
02-08-2019T16:34:48,TeapotOfDoom,i tried everything believe
02-08-2019T16:34:49,TeapotOfDoom,me
02-08-2019T16:35:11,TeapotOfDoom,and i would not categorise me as completely stupid
02-08-2019T16:35:18,AspiringNoodle,Did you try turning off and back on again?
02-08-2019T16:35:22,SageSaga,"no offense- but things that cost that much dont just ""not work"" and come with free maintenance, so im not gonna just believe you"
02-08-2019T16:35:23,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-snicker:
02-08-2019T16:35:44,TeapotOfDoom,haha i haven't even got started
02-08-2019T16:35:56,AspiringNoodle,Can I work as customer support now?
02-08-2019T16:36:06,TeapotOfDoom,this thing has user control meaning you can restrict access to certain settings
02-08-2019T16:36:13,IronHorseComics,fortunately for me I can attest to that. I work at a print shop and we have the repair guy come in almost daily to work on either the big color printer or the big black and white printer
02-08-2019T16:36:25,TeapotOfDoom,but you can sign on using a password OR username
02-08-2019T16:36:51,IronHorseComics,and the color printer is brand new
02-08-2019T16:36:57,TeapotOfDoom,meaning if you choose username and type in admin you've got full control
02-08-2019T16:37:05,SageSaga,brb
02-08-2019T16:37:14,TeapotOfDoom,regardless of you knowing the password or not
02-08-2019T16:37:19,TeapotOfDoom,i mean WHAT???
02-08-2019T16:37:58,TeapotOfDoom,how can you even fuck up that bad? that's just plainly impossible
02-08-2019T16:40:03,TeapotOfDoom,"so no. i it just can't open normal pdfs. it gets an error. but only sometimes, sometimes it only reads the first few pages. i can't pin down a real reason as to why."
02-08-2019T16:40:14,AspiringNoodle,"Okay, for those who want to laugh their butts off"
02-08-2019T16:40:21,TeapotOfDoom,the only possible explaination at this point for me at this point is that the reader on this device does not conform to standard
02-08-2019T16:40:29,AspiringNoodle,Corridor just released their 2nd Tacticool Reload video today
02-08-2019T16:40:36,AspiringNoodle,It's just as ridiculous and over the top as the first xD
02-08-2019T16:40:49,TeapotOfDoom,oh no they did a part two?
02-08-2019T16:41:10,AspiringNoodle,Tac2COOL RELOADS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wk0O95K__to

02-08-2019T16:49:21,TeapotOfDoom,laughing
02-08-2019T16:49:49,TeapotOfDoom,the sword sound effect when she picked up the fork was just top notch xD
02-08-2019T16:50:17,AspiringNoodle,Did you ever watch their video on the largest laser cannon?
02-08-2019T16:50:18,SpazztasticKiwi,what video

02-08-2019T16:51:36,AspiringNoodle,"Things like tacticool reloads, largest laser cannon, longest lightsaber, nerf fortnite"
02-08-2019T16:51:40,AspiringNoodle,"And yes, that was hilarious xD"
02-08-2019T16:51:52,TeapotOfDoom,i saw the remade muzzle flashes this week. they also did big wick in that one
02-08-2019T16:52:22,TeapotOfDoom,everything A S P L O D E S

02-08-2019T17:02:30,RimaDraws,I’m just hyped in general. I know a new book won’t be out for a while but I’ll wait for when it does
02-08-2019T17:02:50,NextGenAnubisKid,The amount of money I'm gonna have to bring to a con to get all the books... XD
02-08-2019T17:03:17,SageSaga,im all done!

02-08-2019T17:12:33,MatyMaty,work is too busy
02-08-2019T17:13:16,AspiringNoodle,"Sitting here waiting for the ice cream man, and trying to figure out if I'm going to go out for dinner"
02-08-2019T17:13:40,AspiringNoodle,I shouldn't need to think this hard over food :ptv-unimpressed:
02-08-2019T17:17:31,SpazztasticKiwi,I see Tom included a clear nothing but Kat sashay with that remake page
02-08-2019T17:17:45,SpazztasticKiwi,I can hear the profile pictures now
02-08-2019T17:18:52,IronHorseComics,I have a feeling I know what half of them will be
02-08-2019T17:19:01,IronHorseComics,and it ain't Kat's face
02-08-2019T17:21:28,TeapotOfDoom,oh no
02-08-2019T17:22:13,SpazztasticKiwi,dem hipssss
02-08-2019T17:22:28,SpazztasticKiwi,though why the hips
02-08-2019T17:22:48,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s not like they do much how are they attractive
02-08-2019T17:22:56,TeapotOfDoom,which platform does lann stream on?
02-08-2019T17:23:03,TeapotOfDoom,and what's his user name?
02-08-2019T17:23:06,SpazztasticKiwi,is it because they move like a clock
02-08-2019T17:23:15,SpazztasticKiwi,twitch - LannSF
02-08-2019T17:23:22,TeapotOfDoom,nice thx
02-08-2019T17:23:32,SpazztasticKiwi,he was here last night
02-08-2019T17:23:38,SpazztasticKiwi,until ass oclock
02-08-2019T17:23:44,TeapotOfDoom,i wanna have the sound with tom cause he was muted in his own stream
02-08-2019T17:23:48,SpazztasticKiwi,as were most of the rest of em
02-08-2019T17:23:58,SpazztasticKiwi,slowly descending into complete madness
02-08-2019T17:24:09,TeapotOfDoom,they were streamin till 11am european
02-08-2019T17:24:22,SpazztasticKiwi,or pure sleep deprivation depending on who you ask
02-08-2019T17:24:26,TeapotOfDoom,which means 5am eastern
02-08-2019T17:24:39,TeapotOfDoom,i think it was a little bit of both
02-08-2019T17:25:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve found it’s very fun to poke at them on stream
02-08-2019T17:25:10,SpazztasticKiwi,lann just gives me too much material
02-08-2019T17:25:12,TeapotOfDoom,i noticed xD
02-08-2019T17:25:24,TeapotOfDoom,they said they missed you after you left
02-08-2019T17:25:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I believe this next stream though I’m gonna flip it completely and be nothing but nice
02-08-2019T17:25:47,TeapotOfDoom,lol
02-08-2019T17:25:51,SpazztasticKiwi,I do kinda feel I’ve been a bit too mean to him
02-08-2019T17:26:09,TeapotOfDoom,now that's something to look forward to xD
02-08-2019T17:26:23,SpazztasticKiwi,he deserves a nice stream - though I can see it now “who are you and what did you do with Kiwi”
02-08-2019T17:26:33,TeapotOfDoom,i hope it's a sketch stream. these are the ones early enough for me
02-08-2019T17:26:44,TeapotOfDoom,lol
02-08-2019T17:28:39,SpazztasticKiwi,perhaps this round will be even more fun
02-08-2019T17:28:42,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m evil
02-08-2019T17:28:52,TeapotOfDoom,lol
02-08-2019T17:29:37,TeapotOfDoom,i'm just searching for an audio cue to sync to (if i've even got the right stream)
02-08-2019T17:29:49,TeapotOfDoom,and found breadsonas what?
02-08-2019T17:32:06,TeapotOfDoom,nope not the right recording
02-08-2019T17:32:54,TeapotOfDoom,damn where is the recording from yesterday... part of the conversation is missing since tom was muted and picarto replay isn't working
02-08-2019T17:37:09,SpazztasticKiwi,you may have to ask Kam Sage or Lann
02-08-2019T17:37:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Kam if I remember was muted on his too but he may have the recording
02-08-2019T17:37:43,SomeNiceUser,There is the recording on YouTube.
02-08-2019T17:40:22,AspiringNoodle,Ice cream man has come by
02-08-2019T17:40:28,AspiringNoodle,I am officially no longer tied to the house
02-08-2019T17:40:38,AspiringNoodle,Now where to get food... :ptv-unimpressed:
02-08-2019T17:43:44,SomeNiceUser,crawls from the dark corner.
02-08-2019T17:43:56,SomeNiceUser,ice cream?
02-08-2019T17:44:53,AspiringNoodle,"That may turn to hot wings, lol"
02-08-2019T17:45:05,SomeNiceUser,Lol
02-08-2019T17:45:29,AspiringNoodle,"I should probably enjoy it while I can.  After this weekend, I'm going hard on changing my eating habits and losing weight"
02-08-2019T17:46:06,SomeNiceUser,Same. I’m gonna have to start working out soon.
02-08-2019T17:46:20,AspiringNoodle,The past few weeks I haven't been eating as much
02-08-2019T17:46:35,AspiringNoodle,"But the times I did eat were rather large meals from restaurants, and as such I've put on weight"
02-08-2019T17:47:14,AspiringNoodle,Part of me wonders if me sitting around obsessing over computer hardware has contributed to this problem
02-08-2019T17:47:20,NibblyBot,New Deviantart Post: Kathrin's Introduction https://www.deviantart.com/twokinds/art/Kathrin-s-Introduction-808271398
02-08-2019T17:47:27,IronHorseComics,I'd say so Noodle
02-08-2019T17:47:31,TeapotOfDoom,Yeah go Noodle! Motivation
02-08-2019T17:48:09,TeapotOfDoom,Recording on yt is still missing toms voice
02-08-2019T17:48:38,IronHorseComics,Tom used his voice?
02-08-2019T17:48:43,TeapotOfDoom,"i hope picartos replay thing starts working again, sage streamed to longest of them"
02-08-2019T17:48:54,TeapotOfDoom,i think so. they talk to him in the rec
02-08-2019T17:49:24,TeapotOfDoom,but since he did not unmute himself in obs (or whatever he's using) you can't hear him on his
02-08-2019T17:50:04,TeapotOfDoom,so best bet is sages recording?
02-08-2019T17:51:55,TeapotOfDoom,or lanns if it appears on twitch
02-08-2019T17:52:47,SomeNiceUser,"So, it’s just PicartoTV and twitch?"
02-08-2019T17:56:34,TeapotOfDoom,whoever fixes their stuff first
02-08-2019T17:56:41,TeapotOfDoom,we'll see
02-08-2019T17:57:17,TeapotOfDoom,also i have tk page 3 open. this could end badly
02-08-2019T17:57:28,TeapotOfDoom,meaning rereading the thing by accident
02-08-2019T17:57:49,SomeNiceUser,"Ah, wish you the best of luck!"
02-08-2019T17:57:55,SomeNiceUser,:ptv-snicker:
02-08-2019T17:58:12,TeapotOfDoom,looks like mei to koneko bus is nonexistent on the net
02-08-2019T17:58:24,TeapotOfDoom,it's only screened in the ghibli museum
02-08-2019T17:58:30,TeapotOfDoom,time to go to japan
02-08-2019T17:59:08,SomeNiceUser,mei to koneko bus? What is that?

02-08-2019T18:05:14,Bgrmystr2,"If it wasn't obvious, or whatever"
02-08-2019T18:12:48,TeapotOfDoom,it's a delicious thuna sandwich
02-08-2019T18:12:55,TeapotOfDoom,except i don't eat tuna
02-08-2019T18:12:56,Bgrmystr2,xD
02-08-2019T18:13:01,SomeNiceUser,"Yeah, but what is it about?"
02-08-2019T18:13:12,TeapotOfDoom,do you know totoro?
02-08-2019T18:13:21,SomeNiceUser,No.

02-08-2019T18:16:20,TeapotOfDoom,Also i love the word Konekobus
02-08-2019T18:16:56,SomeNiceUser,“Kittenbus “ that arouses some curiosity.

02-08-2019T18:17:49,TeapotOfDoom,I still have to watch the Howl's moving castle and Princess Mononoke

02-08-2019T18:18:27,TeapotOfDoom,It's the fusion of a cat and a bus
02-08-2019T18:19:13,SomeNiceUser,":ptv-uneasy: it’s weird, but I still want to see it."

02-08-2019T18:26:10,TeapotOfDoom,thanks for the referece list noodle! I'll save that for later
02-08-2019T18:26:19,AspiringNoodle,...there's one I just saw that's related to The Cat Returns...
02-08-2019T18:26:36,AspiringNoodle,...I've been abusing ghibli fest for the past 2 years ._.
02-08-2019T18:26:56,AspiringNoodle,"Whisper of the Heart, that's the one I was thinking of!"
02-08-2019T18:27:23,TeapotOfDoom,one of my best frieds got a catbus from his girlfriend
02-08-2019T18:27:40,TeapotOfDoom,she made it from clay and then painted it
02-08-2019T18:27:51,TeapotOfDoom,it's amazing. and a storage box
02-08-2019T18:28:28,AspiringNoodle,Actually
02-08-2019T18:28:33,AspiringNoodle,I think I listed all the big Ghibli films
02-08-2019T18:28:41,AspiringNoodle,"...that's pretty sad, actually :c"
02-08-2019T18:29:28,TeapotOfDoom,there's a new one coming out
02-08-2019T18:29:33,AspiringNoodle,And catbus best bus

02-08-2019T18:30:24,Sclimshady,The cat returns is great

02-08-2019T18:31:36,Sclimshady,Wolf children is really good too
02-08-2019T18:31:59,SomeNiceUser,"Ghibli is a new thing that’s been introduced to me, so this is very strange."
02-08-2019T18:32:01,RimaDraws,that isnt one of them
02-08-2019T18:32:08,RimaDraws,wolf children was made by someone else
02-08-2019T18:32:12,SomeNiceUser,But I’m fine with it.
02-08-2019T18:32:13,RimaDraws,but it is good
02-08-2019T18:32:14,Sclimshady,It's also proof that the Japanese are all furries
02-08-2019T18:32:24,RimaDraws,it made me cry
02-08-2019T18:32:27,AspiringNoodle,"If you're interested, Ghibli is officially shut down, but a new studio popped up from a lot of the old staff"
02-08-2019T18:32:29,Sclimshady,"I know Rima, just saying its good"
02-08-2019T18:32:31,SomeNiceUser,You are right Shady.
02-08-2019T18:32:42,Sclimshady,"Same Rima, so many tears"
02-08-2019T18:32:48,AspiringNoodle,Mary and the Witch's Flower is their first film
02-08-2019T18:32:54,AspiringNoodle,"And same, so many tears ;_;"
02-08-2019T18:33:00,Sclimshady,That one is good as well
02-08-2019T18:33:50,TeapotOfDoom,i just found the best catbus wallpaper ever
02-08-2019T18:33:56,TeapotOfDoom,and it was too small
02-08-2019T18:34:01,Sclimshady,Awww

02-08-2019T18:34:23,AspiringNoodle,You will not cry more than when watching it
02-08-2019T18:34:26,RimaDraws,i know its on netflix
02-08-2019T18:34:28,Bgrmystr2,"use IQDB, teapot"

02-08-2019T18:35:31,Sclimshady,"No, is it good?"
02-08-2019T18:35:34,RimaDraws,it is so good
02-08-2019T18:35:34,TeapotOfDoom,but i think it was specifically made for an article
02-08-2019T18:35:36,AspiringNoodle,All these movies about secret magical worlds living bside our own make me sad
02-08-2019T18:35:37,Bgrmystr2,it's a reverse image search site that is generally extremely good at finding sources for anime-sourced material
02-08-2019T18:35:39,RimaDraws,strange but good
02-08-2019T18:35:47,Bgrmystr2,it can go to nsfw sites though so beware
02-08-2019T18:35:49,RimaDraws,your name isnt a studio G movie but its strange too
02-08-2019T18:36:22,TeapotOfDoom,nope no matches
02-08-2019T18:36:24,AspiringNoodle,I liked A Silent Voice <3
02-08-2019T18:36:32,AspiringNoodle,Oh wait... I just remembered
02-08-2019T18:36:39,Bgrmystr2,"it also has links to tineye, google search and saucenou"
02-08-2019T18:36:47,Bgrmystr2,saucenao* asjkgfja
02-08-2019T18:36:47,TeapotOfDoom,also it kinda did. ma poor kitten bus
02-08-2019T18:36:47,AspiringNoodle,Biggest tearjerker anime tied between Angel Beats! and Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day
02-08-2019T18:36:56,RimaDraws,"another non studio G movie that is good is called ""From this Corner of the World"""
02-08-2019T18:37:09,Sclimshady,I loved that one!
02-08-2019T18:37:15,RimaDraws,its so sad tho. goes through the ww2 era i think
02-08-2019T18:37:20,TeapotOfDoom,anyway here's the original wallpaper
02-08-2019T18:37:21,TeapotOfDoom,https://www.layerlemonade.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/kittenbus2_00000-1220x600.jpg
02-08-2019T18:37:22,RimaDraws,summer wars is good too
02-08-2019T18:37:26,Sclimshady,I was just trying to remember the name
02-08-2019T18:37:33,AspiringNoodle,"Grave of the Fireflies is a big tearjerk film, btw"
02-08-2019T18:37:42,RimaDraws,man i need to write these down
02-08-2019T18:37:43,TeapotOfDoom,i upscaled it with waifu2x. worked great
02-08-2019T18:37:56,RimaDraws,Summer Wars was having me on the edge of my seat
02-08-2019T18:37:58,Sclimshady,"Yeah, before and during the nukes Rima"
02-08-2019T18:38:31,SomeNiceUser,Screenshots are great Rima! It helps a lot.
02-08-2019T18:38:45,RimaDraws,there was a new movie where this one girls brother comes from the future and teaches her to appreciate being around him
02-08-2019T18:38:49,RimaDraws,i cant remember the name
02-08-2019T18:38:52,AspiringNoodle,Mirai
02-08-2019T18:38:53,RimaDraws,its supposed to be good
02-08-2019T18:38:54,RimaDraws,YES
02-08-2019T18:38:55,RimaDraws,that one
02-08-2019T18:38:59,AspiringNoodle,I saw that~
02-08-2019T18:39:01,Sclimshady,Never heard of it
02-08-2019T18:39:03,AspiringNoodle,It was sooooooo cute
02-08-2019T18:39:03,RimaDraws,is it good?
02-08-2019T18:39:28,AspiringNoodle,Very
02-08-2019T18:39:32,Bgrmystr2,"that image is probably a 3rd party wallpaper version, teapot"
02-08-2019T18:39:35,Bgrmystr2,if I had to geuss
02-08-2019T18:39:53,Bgrmystr2,I didn't find any higher res with the original cut though
02-08-2019T18:40:10,RimaDraws,ima need to watch that movie then
02-08-2019T18:40:11,Bgrmystr2,so waifu2x would probably be the best usecase
02-08-2019T18:41:02,TeapotOfDoom,jep
02-08-2019T18:41:10,TeapotOfDoom,but i can't save the image
02-08-2019T18:41:12,RimaDraws,i have a few studio G movies that are my favs
02-08-2019T18:41:16,AspiringNoodle,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time is also good
02-08-2019T18:41:17,RimaDraws,i love Arrietty
02-08-2019T18:41:36,Sclimshady,Arietty is the borrowers but upgraded
02-08-2019T18:41:40,TeapotOfDoom,i can set it as my wallpaper but when i save it it won't open
02-08-2019T18:41:44,RimaDraws,yea its good tho
02-08-2019T18:41:47,RimaDraws,very cute
02-08-2019T18:42:08,RimaDraws,i love spirited away and kiki's delivery service as well as princess mononoke
02-08-2019T18:42:14,AspiringNoodle,"Btw, I highly recommend Made in Abyss as an anime series"
02-08-2019T18:42:20,RimaDraws,howl's moving castle is good
02-08-2019T18:42:31,AspiringNoodle,"I saw the movie that condenses the first half of the anime, and it blew my effing mind"
02-08-2019T18:42:45,RimaDraws,i think ive heard of that one
02-08-2019T18:42:59,AspiringNoodle,"I love the author, it's so fucking fascinating"
02-08-2019T18:43:17,AspiringNoodle,"The lore is that the world has been explored in its entirety, and there's only 1 mystery left, The Abyss"
02-08-2019T18:43:25,AspiringNoodle,A giant hole in the middle of an island
02-08-2019T18:44:16,AspiringNoodle,"This whole is massive btw, the width is 1000 meters, and goes more than 20,000 meters deep"
02-08-2019T18:44:27,AspiringNoodle,hole*
02-08-2019T18:44:33,RimaDraws,damn
02-08-2019T18:44:50,AspiringNoodle,Inside the hole are artifacts of a long lost civilization and many mysterious and dangerous creatures
02-08-2019T18:45:25,AspiringNoodle,There's also something called The Curse of the Abyss
02-08-2019T18:45:52,AspiringNoodle,"It's some mysterious force that resides only within the abyss, and only manifests whenever one tries to climb up"
02-08-2019T18:46:29,RimaDraws,there are alot of asian horror stories and weird culture stories that go with anything they have happen
02-08-2019T18:46:51,AspiringNoodle,"The Abyss has been broken up in 6 levels, each with a more debillitating condition"
02-08-2019T18:46:52,RimaDraws,asians don't like writing in red ink
02-08-2019T18:47:48,AspiringNoodle,"So here are the ""Strains of Ascent"" by level"
02-08-2019T18:48:00,AspiringNoodle,1st Layer: Light dizziness and nausea
02-08-2019T18:48:12,RimaDraws,oh that i dont like the sound of
02-08-2019T18:48:13,AspiringNoodle,"2nd Layer: Heavy nausea, headache and numbness of limbs."
02-08-2019T18:48:23,RimaDraws,that i definitely dont like
02-08-2019T18:48:26,AspiringNoodle,3rd Layer: Vertigo combined with visual and auditory hallucinations.
02-08-2019T18:48:27,Sclimshady,This is just altitude sickness
02-08-2019T18:48:30,RimaDraws,oh hell no
02-08-2019T18:48:35,RimaDraws,i have issues with my vertigo
02-08-2019T18:48:38,AspiringNoodle,"4th Layer: Intense full-body pain, dizziness from pain and varying amounts of internal and external bleeding across the body."
02-08-2019T18:48:46,RimaDraws,what the hell o.o
02-08-2019T18:48:51,AspiringNoodle,"5th Layer: Complete sensory deprivation, confusion and self-harming behavior."
02-08-2019T18:49:04,AspiringNoodle,"6th Layer: Loss of humanity or death, or very rarely, the Blessing."
02-08-2019T18:49:17,RimaDraws,why do i suddenly feel chlosterphobic
02-08-2019T18:50:07,Sclimshady,"The walls, they hunger"
02-08-2019T18:50:08,AspiringNoodle,It's completely possible to acclimate one's self to the abyss
02-08-2019T18:50:10,RimaDraws,not alot of things scare me but thinking about that
02-08-2019T18:50:12,RimaDraws,it scares me
02-08-2019T18:50:32,Sclimshady,So it is literally altitude sickness
02-08-2019T18:50:41,AspiringNoodle,Nooooooot exactly
02-08-2019T18:50:57,AspiringNoodle,You can keep going down and down and down and never feel a thing
02-08-2019T18:50:59,RimaDraws,its a curse
02-08-2019T18:51:04,RimaDraws,to see if you can withstand it
02-08-2019T18:51:13,RimaDraws,if you cant you die
02-08-2019T18:51:16,AspiringNoodle,"But the very moment you try to go UP, this curse will bitchslap you upside the head so hard and fast that you will reel"
02-08-2019T18:51:27,RimaDraws,thats a hard no thanks im done
02-08-2019T18:51:46,RimaDraws,its making me sick think about this
02-08-2019T18:51:48,AspiringNoodle,Explorers are defined by the type of whistle they carry around
02-08-2019T18:52:07,AspiringNoodle,"The higher the whistle type, the further you can go down and ascend without feeling the effects"
02-08-2019T18:52:23,AspiringNoodle,It's one of those lifelong careers
02-08-2019T18:52:44,TeapotOfDoom,i have a kittenbus as my wallpaper now
02-08-2019T18:52:48,AspiringNoodle,"White whistles, in particular, can go all the way down to the 5th layer and back up"
02-08-2019T18:52:49,TeapotOfDoom,I'm happy
02-08-2019T18:52:57,AspiringNoodle,The only exception to the rule is the 6th layer
02-08-2019T18:53:24,TeapotOfDoom,i'm tired. I'll go to bed now. night y'all!
02-08-2019T18:53:30,AspiringNoodle,"The 6th layer is an absolute.  Whenever a white whistle decides to descend, they are committing their ""last dive"", and they'll hand off their whistle to other explorers to return to the surface"
02-08-2019T18:53:31,RimaDraws,night teapot
02-08-2019T18:53:31,TeapotOfDoom,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:

02-08-2019T18:53:51,AspiringNoodle,Don't let the curse bite :ptv-snicker:
02-08-2019T18:53:58,TeapotOfDoom,sure won't
02-08-2019T18:54:08,TeapotOfDoom,i have a catbus now come at me
02-08-2019T18:54:19,AspiringNoodle,You should read the wiki for this anime / manga
02-08-2019T18:54:21,AspiringNoodle,It's fascinating
02-08-2019T18:54:34,SomeNiceUser,It sure is.
02-08-2019T18:54:42,RimaDraws,no thanks im ok
02-08-2019T18:55:05,SomeNiceUser,I think I saw some of it.
02-08-2019T18:55:35,AspiringNoodle,"Rima, you see Annihilation?"
02-08-2019T18:55:47,RimaDraws,no
02-08-2019T18:55:56,RimaDraws,i dont know how to comprehend the abyss stuff at the moment
02-08-2019T18:56:32,RimaDraws,like i said normally i am not scared by horror so much but that bothers me
02-08-2019T18:56:46,RimaDraws,plus ive seen things
02-08-2019T18:56:50,AspiringNoodle,Apparently I lied
02-08-2019T18:56:56,AspiringNoodle,There's a 7th layer :D
02-08-2019T18:56:57,RimaDraws,x.x
02-08-2019T18:57:10,AspiringNoodle,7th Layer: Certain death.
02-08-2019T18:57:26,RimaDraws,its pretty apparent that thing is meant to get rid of people
02-08-2019T18:57:55,AspiringNoodle,We're not sure
02-08-2019T18:57:56,SomeNiceUser,The blessing is pretty interesting.
02-08-2019T18:58:09,AspiringNoodle,There's a little robot boy named Reg
02-08-2019T18:58:16,RimaDraws,yea well i am regretting letting my bf off the phone now
02-08-2019T18:58:41,AspiringNoodle,The main protagonist's mother claims to have seen something like him at the edge of The Maelstrom (7th layer)
02-08-2019T18:59:00,SomeNiceUser,I know those two kids at the start of Abiss.
02-08-2019T18:59:20,SomeNiceUser,Were they experimented on?
02-08-2019T18:59:32,AspiringNoodle,The Abyss is quite literally a box covering a hole wrapped in an enigma soaked in mystery and sprinkled with the unknown
02-08-2019T18:59:46,AspiringNoodle,What the fuck is the curse?
02-08-2019T18:59:52,AspiringNoodle,What is at the bottom of the hole?
02-08-2019T18:59:54,Sclimshady,They have a Dr Who anime?
02-08-2019T18:59:58,AspiringNoodle,Why don't the animals seem affected?
02-08-2019T19:00:08,AspiringNoodle,What was this civilization
02-08-2019T19:00:12,AspiringNoodle,Why did they exist in the hole
02-08-2019T19:00:21,AspiringNoodle,Where did they go if their technology was so advanced
02-08-2019T19:00:57,AspiringNoodle,"Not even joking, the abyss even has it's own day night cycle"
02-08-2019T19:01:02,AspiringNoodle,Light comes out of freaking nowhere
02-08-2019T19:01:24,AspiringNoodle,The level of creativity that came from the author is something worth aspiring to
02-08-2019T19:01:51,SomeNiceUser,Certainly.
02-08-2019T19:02:14,AspiringNoodle,"Oh yeah, let's not forget... *drum roll*"
02-08-2019T19:02:19,AspiringNoodle,BIRTHDAY DEATH DISEASE!
02-08-2019T19:02:31,AspiringNoodle,"""Birthday Death Disease is a mysterious disease that occurs on the surface around the Abyss. A person falls horribly ill on their birthday, and by the end of the day they will have died, no matter what medical treatment they receive."
02-08-2019T19:02:42,AspiringNoodle,"The disease was thought to be a rumor, but presently, five people have died on their birthdays in a span of a few weeks. It is a subject of great worry for the citizens of Orth."""
02-08-2019T19:04:26,SomeNiceUser,So everything is a mystery.
02-08-2019T19:04:36,AspiringNoodle,I mean... how could it not be
02-08-2019T19:04:37,RimaDraws,that is seriously eerie
02-08-2019T19:04:53,AspiringNoodle,"We have an island in the middle of an ocean with a hole that's 1000 meters wide and over 20,000 meters deep"
02-08-2019T19:05:20,RimaDraws,so this is a real place?
02-08-2019T19:05:24,AspiringNoodle,Nope
02-08-2019T19:05:28,RimaDraws,oh thank god

02-08-2019T22:47:26,Sclimshady,"I know! they're in love out of hero mode too, so obviously"

02-08-2019T23:00:07,SpazztasticKiwi,we’re only 17 episodes in the reboot
02-08-2019T23:00:39,SpazztasticKiwi,the first round didn’t complete the story or even follow it to the actual end
02-08-2019T23:00:58,SpazztasticKiwi,it didn’t even include what all’s in it
02-08-2019T23:01:38,SpazztasticKiwi,but they’re saying this reboot is set to follow the full story to the end likely meaning longer seasons or more episodes for another season
02-08-2019T23:05:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom were you doing anything with those doots you did yesterday at the manic hour
