14-11-2019T21:37:03,Twokinds,I'm the youngest
14-11-2019T21:37:09,TheFreindlyDeathclaw,Hi Tom

14-11-2019T21:37:29,JangoBob,birth date says otherwise but okay
14-11-2019T21:37:31,Ordithus,"Me, I'm 111"
14-11-2019T21:37:34,SageSaga,Ron i think is older than me- at least his hair says so
14-11-2019T21:37:37,MviluUatusun,Anyone older than 64?
14-11-2019T21:37:48,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-statuerawr:*[AYE]
14-11-2019T21:38:02,MviluUatusun,"My mom is still alive, too.  She's 83 until next month."
14-11-2019T21:38:07,SageSaga,though to be fair- Ron's greying hair actually looks good <_<
14-11-2019T21:38:10,HoverdudeXL,Nop
14-11-2019T21:38:12,IronHorseComics,you'd say the same thing about me but I live a stressful life that grays my hair on a daily basis
14-11-2019T21:38:19,Nekonny,im 40
14-11-2019T21:38:25,JangoBob,man im 16

14-11-2019T21:38:53,Flake,i turned 27 last month
14-11-2019T21:39:06,MviluUatusun,"So far, I'm still the oldest here."
14-11-2019T21:39:11,HoverdudeXL,No prob jango
14-11-2019T21:39:21,IronHorseComics,"Ron, you're over the hill now, how do you feel?"
14-11-2019T21:39:33,MviluUatusun,Hill?  What hill?  I don't remember any hill.
14-11-2019T21:39:36,Nekonny,?
14-11-2019T21:39:41,FoxxTrotter,"Budzbunny is the only one I know older than you, Mvilu, who frequents here. He is 66."
14-11-2019T21:39:42,IronHorseComics,you said you're 40
14-11-2019T21:39:49,Nekonny,right?

14-11-2019T21:40:02,MviluUatusun,"Not yet, Foxx.  I'm only 64."
14-11-2019T21:40:14,IronHorseComics,"when you turn 40 you're ""over the hill"" as in past the half way point of a normal human lifespan"
14-11-2019T21:40:16,JangoBob,so currently the youngest is 14 held by hoverdude and the oldest is 64 held by mvilu
14-11-2019T21:40:37,MviluUatusun,"I still don't feel old, though, Iron."
14-11-2019T21:40:43,Mihari,"Until I can't pull it off anymore, I'm 24!"
