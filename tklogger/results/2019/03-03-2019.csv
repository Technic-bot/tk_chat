03-03-2019T15:21:21,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
03-03-2019T15:23:34,Twokinds,Are you talking today? Cause I didn't stream today
03-03-2019T15:29:02,Xexanoth,"speaking of sketches, did patreon mess up posting or are you still working on whatever you're uploading today? just asking cause normally theres an upload by now"
03-03-2019T15:30:22,CrimsonQuill,"It said there was a stream in my email, unless that was from last night..."
03-03-2019T15:30:40,CrimsonQuill,"Or rather, yesterday morning..."
03-03-2019T15:30:55,Xexanoth,emails are usually super late
03-03-2019T15:31:16,CrimsonQuill,I see
03-03-2019T15:31:18,Xexanoth,i used that for about 2 weeks before i deactivated it again because it was never on time

03-03-2019T15:42:01,CrimsonQuill,True dat
03-03-2019T15:42:16,CrimsonQuill,I've made myself my first stew.
03-03-2019T15:42:57,CrimsonQuill,"I literally just threw some sliced carrot, diced lamb, baby rooster potatoes, sliced onion and beans together into a saucpan, added water, and cooked."
03-03-2019T15:43:05,CrimsonQuill,"Meat was a bit tough, and the flavour was low."
03-03-2019T15:43:10,CrimsonQuill,But it's a start.
03-03-2019T15:44:12,CrimsonQuill,Oooh-I'm off for a bit

03-03-2019T21:14:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Eh boobs aren‚Äôt that big a deal
03-03-2019T21:19:46,SpazztasticKiwi,I should know
03-03-2019T21:20:28,unsteddyphoenix,youre wrong but ok!
03-03-2019T21:21:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Consider this: you are attracted to and fawn over what amounts to a few pounds of accumulated fat
03-03-2019T21:22:29,unsteddyphoenix,Yup!
03-03-2019T21:22:35,unsteddyphoenix,Tbh thats basically what people are.

03-03-2019T21:26:26,Bgrmystr2,That's just it. They're fake
03-03-2019T21:26:42,unsteddyphoenix,You can store snacks there too?? Boobs are amazing!
03-03-2019T21:27:00,SpazztasticKiwi,more like food falls and they‚Äôre there to catch it
03-03-2019T21:27:13,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-maddiessparkles: amazing~
03-03-2019T21:27:22,Bgrmystr2,you think that really changes how phoenix sees it xD
03-03-2019T21:27:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I guess they‚Äôre coolish
03-03-2019T21:28:03,SpazztasticKiwi,But I‚Äôve had my own for awhile so
03-03-2019T21:28:09,SpazztasticKiwi,meh
03-03-2019T21:30:21,unsteddyphoenix,check your boob privilege

03-03-2019T21:35:19,Bgrmystr2,mainly cuz you didn't have them prior :P
03-03-2019T21:36:39,Ordithus,That's only part of it!
03-03-2019T21:36:58,Bgrmystr2,xD
03-03-2019T21:37:08,Bgrmystr2,100% = part of it
03-03-2019T21:37:14,Bgrmystr2,Can't deny..
03-03-2019T21:37:23,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
03-03-2019T21:43:57,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôd be fun for a bit yeah. It has its perks
03-03-2019T21:44:22,SpazztasticKiwi,But there‚Äôs really one main point to be happy you‚Äôre male
03-03-2019T21:44:52,SpazztasticKiwi,You can choose if you don‚Äôt want kids to have that permanently arranged
03-03-2019T21:45:30,Bgrmystr2,you can do that as a female.
03-03-2019T21:45:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Uh no
03-03-2019T21:45:46,Bgrmystr2,My mom did it. Yes you can.
03-03-2019T21:45:48,SpazztasticKiwi,To get your tubes tied or burned
03-03-2019T21:45:55,unsteddyphoenix,yeah tubes tied
03-03-2019T21:45:55,SpazztasticKiwi,You must be at least 25
03-03-2019T21:45:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Married
03-03-2019T21:46:01,unsteddyphoenix,Burned? sounds spooky
03-03-2019T21:46:07,unsteddyphoenix,What? that doesnt sound right lol
03-03-2019T21:46:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Have at least two kids
03-03-2019T21:46:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Preferably a boy and girl
03-03-2019T21:46:23,Bgrmystr2,two kids requirement? :o
03-03-2019T21:46:27,Ordithus,Wat
03-03-2019T21:46:34,SpazztasticKiwi,And above all else they will ask your husbands permission
03-03-2019T21:46:38,Ordithus,That doesn't seem legal
03-03-2019T21:46:39,unsteddyphoenix,Mmmm unsure about all that.
03-03-2019T21:46:46,SpazztasticKiwi,I shit you not
03-03-2019T21:46:56,unsteddyphoenix,Do you live in the 1800s?
03-03-2019T21:47:06,SpazztasticKiwi,In some states. In fact from what I know it‚Äôs most states
03-03-2019T21:47:22,Ordithus,"If that is the case, those laws are unjust"
03-03-2019T21:47:22,unsteddyphoenix,america explain
03-03-2019T21:47:38,Bgrmystr2,I don't know? Some states do live in the 1800s yes
03-03-2019T21:47:47,Ordithus,Yeah...
03-03-2019T21:48:03,Ordithus,"In case you didn't know, teddy, our laws can vary an incredible amount from state to state"
03-03-2019T21:49:48,SpazztasticKiwi,I can just about promise if I walked into a hospital and asked to be sterilized they would basically laugh
03-03-2019T21:50:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Your mother likely got her procedure because she was older or already had you and whatever siblings you had
03-03-2019T21:51:13,unsteddyphoenix,That seems absurd but ok
03-03-2019T21:51:29,unsteddyphoenix,Well I gotta go
03-03-2019T21:51:30,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, she did meet all of those things you stated :thinking:"
03-03-2019T21:51:30,unsteddyphoenix,But still
03-03-2019T21:51:33,unsteddyphoenix,boobs > all
03-03-2019T21:51:36,Bgrmystr2,but that still seems absurd
03-03-2019T21:51:39,unsteddyphoenix,bye
03-03-2019T21:51:40,Bgrmystr2,seeya later phoenix
03-03-2019T21:53:26,Ordithus,Bye steddy
03-03-2019T21:53:39,Ordithus,My mom also met those things when she had that done
03-03-2019T21:53:47,Ordithus,I was actually #3
03-03-2019T21:54:06,Bgrmystr2,"From what I read, those are not actually legal requirements, kiwi"
03-03-2019T21:54:32,Bgrmystr2,but apparently women have a hard time with it either way
03-03-2019T21:55:28,SpazztasticKiwi,I have no doubt it varies
03-03-2019T21:56:02,SpazztasticKiwi,But getting someone to do it without seeking another persons opinion other than she who‚Äôs asking is difficult
03-03-2019T21:56:59,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs why many have to just opt for birth control
03-03-2019T21:57:34,Ordithus,https://www.alabamapublichealth.gov/familyplanning/assets/factsaboutsterilizationwomen.pdf
03-03-2019T22:00:01,SpazztasticKiwi,21 in Alabama. Still don‚Äôt see it being easy
03-03-2019T22:01:10,Bgrmystr2,"From what I've read, lots of people get it done, then regret it later."
03-03-2019T22:01:28,Bgrmystr2,and that it's an extremely common thing to happen
03-03-2019T22:02:13,Ordithus,Can always adopt~
03-03-2019T22:02:24,Ordithus,"Not the same, but kids need homes"
03-03-2019T22:02:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Well if they regret it that‚Äôs their choice
03-03-2019T22:05:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Some sterilization is uncovered by insurance too
03-03-2019T22:05:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Though I want to say surely it wouldn‚Äôt be an expensive procedure with how they describe it
03-03-2019T22:12:35,SpazztasticKiwi,"The unfortunate thing is as accessible as it shows to be, there‚Äôs shown to be exceptions"
03-03-2019T22:13:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe one day I‚Äôll go in to see about it for myself but I‚Äôm single so there‚Äôs not a risk for now üòÜ
03-03-2019T22:14:17,SpazztasticKiwi,If you can picture that thinking meme it‚Äôs ‚Äúcan‚Äôt get pregnant if you‚Äôre single‚Äù

03-03-2019T22:17:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh yeah. And it‚Äôs preganagant
03-03-2019T22:17:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Oop

03-03-2019T22:18:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Poor zen. I‚Äôd see a doctor if you think you may be
03-03-2019T22:18:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Might be phantom feelings from your link with your sister tho
03-03-2019T22:19:17,SpazztasticKiwi,"You know there‚Äôs a thing. If Nat could or did get pregnant, would the symptoms leak though to him"
03-03-2019T22:20:08,Ordithus,No doubt.
03-03-2019T22:20:19,SpazztasticKiwi,"Cause if it‚Äôs high emotions that effect it, there‚Äôs fewer times for that than prgenat time"
03-03-2019T22:20:44,Ordithus,So very relevant http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/449/
03-03-2019T22:21:20,Ordithus,Aaand the even more relevant one http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/743/
03-03-2019T22:22:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Ooo fun
03-03-2019T22:23:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Things have changed with those rules too though it may seem. Ill stick to my plan for now though
03-03-2019T22:23:22,BadFoMo,"Hmm... Sketch request; Zen dealing with pregnancy symptoms through the link. Yes or No? ...Also, would Tom allow or snub it?"
03-03-2019T22:24:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt see it being too popular
03-03-2019T22:24:53,SpazztasticKiwi,"Cause it means Keith and Nat have not only, well, had some fun, but maybe decided to go for a family"
03-03-2019T22:25:11,SpazztasticKiwi,And I‚Äôm not sure either would
03-03-2019T22:25:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Or even could
03-03-2019T22:26:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Besides. Haven‚Äôt we tortured Zen enough
03-03-2019T22:28:01,BadFoMo,"We have? But anyway, when put like that, I think Tom would definitely snub it."
03-03-2019T22:29:02,SpazztasticKiwi,The dudes already missing a leg. Ain‚Äôt h been through enough
03-03-2019T22:29:43,BadFoMo,Missing? I thought it was just burned.
03-03-2019T22:30:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Well maybe it‚Äôs not gone yet
03-03-2019T22:30:23,SpazztasticKiwi,But that‚Äôs our ... running joke
03-03-2019T22:30:26,SpazztasticKiwi,ü•Å
03-03-2019T22:30:44,BadFoMo,Ah.
03-03-2019T22:31:58,SpazztasticKiwi,"Anyway, besides that catastrophe of sifting through medical procedures and operations and what not"
03-03-2019T22:32:15,SpazztasticKiwi,We got a call today from my boss‚Äôs boss‚Äôs boss
03-03-2019T22:33:02,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs got to do with me thinking either I‚Äôm in some trouble or the store is
03-03-2019T22:34:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Cause I filed a report about how treatment had been going for everyone in the department and how fed up we were and so on and so forth
03-03-2019T22:34:28,SpazztasticKiwi,And she wants to come down. To the store. And chat
03-03-2019T22:34:41,SpazztasticKiwi,So I have the feeling someone may be in some deep shit
03-03-2019T22:35:05,BadFoMo,You or your boss?
03-03-2019T22:35:31,SpazztasticKiwi,"I dunno yet. I want to bet if it‚Äôs both, boss may be in more"
03-03-2019T22:36:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Though there‚Äôs also no telling if head boss has an issue with me at all. We‚Äôre just scheduled to have a conversation so far
03-03-2019T22:36:54,BadFoMo,Good luck?
03-03-2019T22:37:10,SpazztasticKiwi,But my point is that this report has gotten her attention so hard she‚Äôs wanting to come down to discuss it
03-03-2019T22:37:43,Bgrmystr2,"I'd say generally that's a good thing, but hope it isn't a bad thing"
03-03-2019T22:37:48,Ordithus,^
03-03-2019T22:39:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Office lady seemed a hair panicked when she asked me when this lady was wanting to come down so idk if it‚Äôs gonna be a case of people walking on pins n needles or what
03-03-2019T22:40:36,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno how important this job is to you, or if it wouldn't be hard to find another, but personally I'd be transparent and tell them all the shit when they come down and talk to you."
03-03-2019T22:41:03,Bgrmystr2,"if they use it against you, then you had no chance of making things better there in the first place."
03-03-2019T22:41:20,Bgrmystr2,"and if they fix the problems, all the better."
03-03-2019T22:41:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"Despite not really having anywhere to swap out to, I‚Äôve debated putting in my two weeks awhile ago"
03-03-2019T22:41:49,Bgrmystr2,use that.
03-03-2019T22:42:07,SpazztasticKiwi,I just decided to do this report because of how ridiculous it was
03-03-2019T22:42:33,SpazztasticKiwi,And I included some of what we‚Äôd already experienced in this report. It‚Äôs what I suspect got her attention
03-03-2019T22:45:11,SpazztasticKiwi,But I only figured it would only do either nothing or put a fire under their asses
03-03-2019T22:45:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Not sound the bullhorn for the head honcho
03-03-2019T22:47:29,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, if it gets shit done and fixed, you may have a good spot."
03-03-2019T22:47:58,Bgrmystr2,there's a lot of times where the owner doesn't actually realize that bad shit happens in their own establishment
03-03-2019T22:51:55,SpazztasticKiwi,"My only problem is if it fixes it, good. But with the hubbub it could bring - especially if this boss fussed at our boss - is it gonna turn everything inside out from chaos"
03-03-2019T22:52:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"Will a mess it makes be worth it, more like it"
03-03-2019T22:53:00,Ordithus,Here's hoping
03-03-2019T22:53:13,Ordithus,:fingers_crossed:
03-03-2019T22:53:31,Bgrmystr2,yeh I hope it all goes swell.
03-03-2019T22:54:00,Bgrmystr2,"though remember that if the big boss fusses at your boss, and your boss gets rid of you or makes it worse, that's something you can report and that'll prolly get them fired."
03-03-2019T22:54:10,Bgrmystr2,because that right there is grounds enough
03-03-2019T22:54:16,Ordithus,I was just about to say that
03-03-2019T22:54:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Retaliation is a big no no I know. They watch that with as much importance as treating everyone equally
03-03-2019T22:55:18,SpazztasticKiwi,despite things like religion differences
