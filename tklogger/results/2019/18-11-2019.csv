18-11-2019T16:11:27,Orthonox,Get the fools to fight each other. Let them forget who the real enemy is.

18-11-2019T16:31:05,TerraTheWizard,i spent all today thinking it was wednesday
18-11-2019T16:33:44,SpazztasticKiwi,self-induced isolation
18-11-2019T16:58:07,tehbear,i prefer fridays where ive spent most of the day thinking its thursday
18-11-2019T16:58:28,SpazztasticKiwi,I work on Wednesdays so I’ll pass
18-11-2019T17:00:04,SpazztasticKiwi,my shelf arrives Thursday so there’s that on the other hand
18-11-2019T17:01:05,tehbear,what kind of shelf?
18-11-2019T17:02:56,tehbear,:closed_book::green_book::blue_book::orange_book: bookshelf?
18-11-2019T17:03:07,SpazztasticKiwi,does it matter
18-11-2019T17:03:11,SpazztasticKiwi,shelf is shelf
18-11-2019T17:03:22,tehbear,stuff shelf then
18-11-2019T17:03:27,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s got 9 cubes
18-11-2019T17:03:27,tehbear,the best kind
18-11-2019T17:04:31,SpazztasticKiwi,"books, knickknacks, nail polish, makeup, paints, dvds, jewelry boxes, cat"
18-11-2019T17:05:36,SpazztasticKiwi,all 98 dvds might not fit but we’ll see
18-11-2019T17:05:57,tehbear,"if i was an architect, i would just line the walls with shelves. can never have enough"
18-11-2019T17:39:07,SpazztasticKiwi,what’s a Christmas present for someone who’s pregnant
18-11-2019T17:46:09,Twokinds,Uh.... I have no idea
18-11-2019T17:46:22,Twokinds,That's completely out of my area of expertise
18-11-2019T17:56:34,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s out of mine too
18-11-2019T17:57:00,SpazztasticKiwi,"at first, I was gonna go for a wine bottle and chocolates for whoever I drew for secret santa"
18-11-2019T17:57:11,SpazztasticKiwi,but then I drew the one who can’t have alcohol
18-11-2019T18:03:00,BadFoMo,Cheat and give money. Now that gift is their problem.
18-11-2019T18:05:14,TerraTheWizard,"put the spend value in cash, but in a big box"
18-11-2019T18:05:31,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-keith8D:
18-11-2019T18:06:15,ThingsAreMoving,"A mug with ""#1 mom"", or some similar text."
18-11-2019T18:06:35,ThingsAreMoving,Or just buy some high quality chocolates. That's always a good gift.
18-11-2019T18:07:07,TerraTheWizard,can't go far wrong with some good choccies
18-11-2019T18:16:47,RimaDraws,Hi guys
18-11-2019T18:17:08,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-nibsbounce:
18-11-2019T18:18:36,SpazztasticKiwi,she’s been having big issue with keeping things down though so I can’t see how chocolate would do
18-11-2019T18:20:05,RimaDraws,@SpazztasticKiwi I recommend that you get them a baby’s r us or get some saltine crackers. Usually stuff like that helps the stomach the crackers do
18-11-2019T18:21:24,RimaDraws,But if you want to get her something personally maybe some comfy slippers or some cocoa butter for her belly
18-11-2019T18:22:13,RimaDraws,They can’t take medicine because it affects the baby and I also recommend making soup if you know how to cook. Something that will help settle her stomach like chicken noodle
18-11-2019T18:22:55,RimaDraws,Popsicles also help
18-11-2019T18:23:41,RimaDraws,Baby’s r us gift cards help too for the baby
18-11-2019T18:23:51,RimaDraws,To buy clothes and such. That’s all I have
18-11-2019T18:47:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I felt bad for laughing but her doctor has given her a caffeine and sugar limit
18-11-2019T18:47:54,SpazztasticKiwi,she’s used to drinking this inhuman size cup of coffee in the mornings
18-11-2019T19:13:54,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
18-11-2019T19:15:39,SpazztasticKiwi,took me near 2 hours to clear the spot for that shelf
18-11-2019T19:16:07,SpazztasticKiwi,now it looks like everything in the rooms afraid of the west wall of my room
18-11-2019T19:18:24,Sclimshady,West is the scariest direction
18-11-2019T19:33:54,SpazztasticKiwi,"and Tom, how doth thou have no pregnacy know how if you have a pregnant char"
18-11-2019T19:33:59,SpazztasticKiwi,character
18-11-2019T19:48:18,Twokinds,That's why Flora's been pregnant for 14 years.
18-11-2019T19:48:36,Twokinds,I don't know what happens next.
18-11-2019T20:06:20,SpazztasticKiwi,the “miracle” of childbirth
18-11-2019T20:06:43,SpazztasticKiwi,or a baby shower we haven’t even gotten a baby shower
18-11-2019T20:25:44,JojoF2415,Flora’s pregnancy is equal to my life in this world
18-11-2019T20:26:19,JojoF2415,That went wrong
18-11-2019T20:27:03,JojoF2415,My whole entire life in this world is as long as flora’s pregnancy
18-11-2019T20:27:11,JojoF2415,Much better
18-11-2019T20:34:53,HoverdudeXL,hello
18-11-2019T20:36:25,JojoF2415,Hello
18-11-2019T21:42:04,SpazztasticKiwi,i wonder if Flora would be mean enough to fake labor just to freak Trace out
18-11-2019T22:00:14,SpazztasticKiwi,“Trace my water broke” “well turn off the tap then” *loud smack*
18-11-2019T22:32:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom are you looking into DS or is it eh nah I’ll pass
