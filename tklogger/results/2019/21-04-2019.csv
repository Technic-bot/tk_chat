21-04-2019T00:18:11,xcvb,BBye  o/
21-04-2019T01:12:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Might be up a lil longer
21-04-2019T01:12:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Sleeping hasn’t been happening for me
21-04-2019T01:21:05,Twokinds,How old is rose again... lol
21-04-2019T01:21:31,Twokinds,Oh righ
21-04-2019T01:22:06,Bgrmystr2,Eternally 18 years old.
21-04-2019T01:22:13,Bgrmystr2,Old enough to do all the fun stuff.
21-04-2019T01:22:45,SpazztasticKiwi,You’re asking us?
21-04-2019T01:23:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Bit of a bad sign
21-04-2019T01:23:45,Twokinds,Honestly sometimes the fans know better than me.
21-04-2019T01:24:20,Bgrmystr2,tis true.
21-04-2019T01:24:26,Bgrmystr2,"That said, I dunno her age :/"
21-04-2019T01:24:37,ZRO4825,I believe it's somewhere around 28 or 29
21-04-2019T01:24:44,ZRO4825,"iirc from conversations on Discord, that is."
21-04-2019T01:26:12,Twokinds,She is probably about 28
21-04-2019T01:26:58,Twokinds,"She was 8-9 in the flashbacks when euchre went off to the Templar college, and it probably took a year or two for Euchre to get together with Mary and make Raine."
21-04-2019T01:27:03,Twokinds,And then Raine is 18 right now.
21-04-2019T01:30:25,Twokinds,...
21-04-2019T01:30:32,Twokinds,How tall would you say Rose is?
21-04-2019T01:33:16,ZRO4825,O.O;
21-04-2019T01:33:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Don’t you have a height for Flora who has been next to Rose
21-04-2019T01:33:36,ZRO4825,"That's....a very good question...shorter than Trace, isn't she? Well, at least now."
21-04-2019T01:33:48,Bgrmystr2,have you never put her on a height chart?
21-04-2019T01:34:35,InTheLionsDen,"Looking back at some sketches, you had her about the same height as Kat in the Stern Kathrin sketch."
21-04-2019T01:35:26,Bgrmystr2,This is probably a good page if you have a height for Eric http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/963/
21-04-2019T01:35:36,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno how tall he is, but Rose is obviously taller"
21-04-2019T01:36:03,InTheLionsDen,Slightly shorter than Raine in the Rose and Raine Festival sketch.
21-04-2019T01:36:59,unsteddyphoenix,I vaguely remember rose being 26. Around there.
21-04-2019T01:37:03,Bgrmystr2,"http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/1030/ Looks a bit taller than trace, even, probably by an inch or two?"
21-04-2019T01:37:26,unsteddyphoenix,"So by deduction, 5'10""?"
21-04-2019T01:37:51,Bgrmystr2,How tall is trace?
21-04-2019T01:38:14,CrimsonQuill,mornin'
21-04-2019T01:38:17,unsteddyphoenix,5'7-5'8
21-04-2019T01:38:25,unsteddyphoenix,Whats that old height chart say
21-04-2019T01:38:35,Bgrmystr2,the old chart has tiger trace
21-04-2019T01:38:50,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno if there's one with human trace, or if they're the same height either way"
21-04-2019T01:39:10,CrimsonQuill,What was the last stream sketch?
21-04-2019T01:39:21,Twokinds,She's hunched over
21-04-2019T01:39:26,Bgrmystr2,https://www.deviantart.com/twokinds/art/Male-Bust-and-Height-Chart-368873856
21-04-2019T01:39:32,CrimsonQuill,Morning Tom
21-04-2019T01:39:49,Twokinds,Cause she old
21-04-2019T01:40:19,Twokinds,I'll say 5'11
21-04-2019T01:40:48,Twokinds,Much lighter than Raine though.
21-04-2019T01:40:50,Bgrmystr2,"even leaning forward like in 1030, it wouldn't give her more than an inch, cuz she's not too far leaning forward, but yeah 5'11 sounds fair"
21-04-2019T01:40:55,unsteddyphoenix,Hm true
21-04-2019T01:42:00,unsteddyphoenix,Why lighter?
21-04-2019T01:42:14,Bgrmystr2,"old, less muscle mass most likely"
21-04-2019T01:42:23,Bgrmystr2,for at least one thing
21-04-2019T01:42:53,unsteddyphoenix,I hope she eats enough
21-04-2019T01:42:55,Bgrmystr2,she's probably also fairly slim
21-04-2019T01:42:58,Bgrmystr2,yeah same
21-04-2019T01:43:22,CrimsonQuill,She seems alright to me...
21-04-2019T01:43:34,Bgrmystr2,"I would guess she's probably like flora, has a slim but flexible build"
21-04-2019T01:44:03,unsteddyphoenix,Oh yeah. Thinking about it young rose does seem skinnier
21-04-2019T01:44:06,Bgrmystr2,Raine definitely does not seem that way as a keidran herself lol
21-04-2019T01:46:51,Twokinds,Rose is much skinnier than Raine
21-04-2019T01:47:14,Bgrmystr2,"yeah I figured as much. It's just hard to tell since in her older age, we always see her wearing that outfit"
21-04-2019T01:47:19,Bgrmystr2,so it's kind of hard to tell
21-04-2019T01:47:38,Bgrmystr2,"but she was still fairly slim when she was young too, so"
21-04-2019T01:47:39,Twokinds,Yeah but you can see it when she's young too
21-04-2019T01:47:40,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah, but young rose was hella naked"
21-04-2019T01:47:52,Twokinds,Very little fat on her bones
21-04-2019T01:48:06,unsteddyphoenix,"Whatever age rose is, euchre has to be 2~ years older right?"
21-04-2019T01:48:15,Twokinds,Indeed
21-04-2019T01:48:41,Bgrmystr2,I thought Euchre was like 32 or 34 by now?
21-04-2019T01:48:54,Bgrmystr2,some really high age for a keidran to live
21-04-2019T01:50:01,Bgrmystr2,he's like jedi master hologram levels of old
21-04-2019T01:50:08,Twokinds,"No, 30 seems about right."
21-04-2019T01:50:20,Bgrmystr2,":thinking: hm, okay"
21-04-2019T01:50:58,Bgrmystr2,was it 25 or something that where the average height of keidran age is?
21-04-2019T01:51:10,Bgrmystr2,I remember him living a bit longer than usual
21-04-2019T01:55:13,Twokinds,"20 is average, but most Keidran that make it out of childhood can live to be 20 - 30"
21-04-2019T01:55:24,Bgrmystr2,"ah right there it is, okay"
21-04-2019T01:55:27,Bgrmystr2,that's what I remembered.
21-04-2019T01:55:31,Twokinds,Just as human lifespan is around 68 or something but technically humans can live to be 100.
21-04-2019T01:55:48,Bgrmystr2,that's fair
21-04-2019T01:56:02,Twokinds,A 30 year old Keidran is like seeing a 115 year old human. Pretty rare.
21-04-2019T01:56:10,Bgrmystr2,goddamn haha
21-04-2019T01:56:19,SpazztasticKiwi,hate life. God makes you live longer
21-04-2019T01:56:19,Twokinds,Euchre is suspiciously youthful.
21-04-2019T01:56:27,Bgrmystr2,I don't think anyone's lived that long.. have they?
21-04-2019T01:56:57,Bgrmystr2,well sonuvabitch they have.
21-04-2019T01:56:58,Bgrmystr2,holyshit
21-04-2019T01:57:01,unsteddyphoenix,One say ill know your secrets euchrr.
21-04-2019T01:57:05,unsteddyphoenix,One day...
21-04-2019T01:57:20,Bgrmystr2,someone lived for 122 years..
21-04-2019T01:57:21,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah ofc they have
21-04-2019T01:57:38,unsteddyphoenix,But euchre is so SPRY
21-04-2019T01:58:17,iliar,"The Rose looks pretty good for a ""100 year old human"". Real humans at this age look worse."
21-04-2019T01:59:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Fur hides wrinkles like the worlds best concealer
21-04-2019T01:59:39,Bgrmystr2,"yeah prettymuch, kiwi"
21-04-2019T02:00:24,unsteddyphoenix,Old cats always seem more active than old humans
21-04-2019T02:02:03,iliar,"I mean manage a large estate. At the age of 110+ years, I would like to manage at least my urinary bladder."
21-04-2019T02:02:04,InTheLionsDen,As per one of the aging sketches Rose has yet to reach the shrunken old form.
21-04-2019T02:02:32,ZRO4825,"Well that and we've already determined via the comic itself that Rose is somehow tied into the estate, so likely that's affecting things."
21-04-2019T02:02:32,Bgrmystr2,xD course cuz it wasn't real
21-04-2019T02:02:39,Bgrmystr2,it was a parody
21-04-2019T02:07:36,unsteddyphoenix,Nah def canon
21-04-2019T02:10:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Anyone else follow ERB
21-04-2019T02:13:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Nm
21-04-2019T02:20:04,DarthRexKing,GOODNIGHT!
21-04-2019T02:22:24,SpazztasticKiwi,no all caps it’s 2 am n no ones can read that loud yet
21-04-2019T02:27:10,Twokinds,I'm trying to figure out how to describe Rose and Saria's friendship.
21-04-2019T02:29:12,InTheLionsDen,Mutually supportive
21-04-2019T02:29:44,unsteddyphoenix,Somewhat gay
21-04-2019T02:30:02,Twokinds,pff
21-04-2019T02:30:43,unsteddyphoenix,Female bromance with underlyinh sexual tension
21-04-2019T02:32:06,Bgrmystr2,femance?
21-04-2019T02:32:13,Bgrmystr2,.. no that sounds weird
21-04-2019T02:32:54,InTheLionsDen,Open to creative and experimental interactions.
21-04-2019T02:35:01,iliar,Tom. My friend complains that his suggestions do not fall into the pool.
21-04-2019T02:35:14,iliar,Can I clarify why?
21-04-2019T02:35:34,iliar,His nickname: Ellarihan
21-04-2019T02:36:25,Twokinds,Let me check...
21-04-2019T02:36:40,iliar,His suggestions: Eric dresses human-Kathrin and explain her why walk nudity it is a bad idea
21-04-2019T02:37:08,iliar,Or something like this
21-04-2019T02:39:19,Twokinds,"Ah, I see."
21-04-2019T02:39:22,Twokinds,It was in the final round.
21-04-2019T02:39:55,Twokinds,"Because I switched Tom's Pick and Vote, the final round was just a Tom Pick and didn't get voted on."
21-04-2019T02:40:01,Twokinds,I'll make sure that doesn't happen again.
21-04-2019T02:41:33,Bgrmystr2,ah you usually do a pick first and then start the suggestion once the poll is done or just do two votes in a row later
21-04-2019T02:41:49,iliar,"Well, I will tell him. Thanks"
21-04-2019T02:42:10,Twokinds,Yeah
21-04-2019T02:42:39,Bgrmystr2,I figured it was just up to you whether you started with a pick first or a poll first cuz you usually swapped to have two polls in a row if you picked on the first sketch
21-04-2019T02:42:54,Bgrmystr2,just didn't happen this time around I guess lol
21-04-2019T02:43:05,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
21-04-2019T02:44:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Saria and Rose have a sisterly relationship
21-04-2019T02:45:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Sorta
21-04-2019T02:46:08,iliar,Funny fact. I always vote via VPN . And it always worked. Today in the first round I vote as usual. And then the system did not let me vote. Interestingly this is a war with VPN or I just had no luck.
21-04-2019T02:47:12,Bgrmystr2,it's possible that it was trying to connect to you the same vpn server as another user using VPN as well
21-04-2019T02:47:17,Bgrmystr2,so it would be two IP addresses
21-04-2019T02:47:43,Twokinds,"Yeah, Saria and Rose loved each other very deeply, in a platonic sense. They were extremely close."
21-04-2019T02:48:51,unsteddyphoenix,Are you SURE it was purely platonic
21-04-2019T02:49:05,unsteddyphoenix,Idk theres some vibes there
21-04-2019T02:49:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Saria kinda adopted Rose as family and protected her as such
21-04-2019T02:50:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Or somesuch along those lines
21-04-2019T02:50:27,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah thats so romantic~
21-04-2019T02:50:53,iliar,"No, when several people from the same IP system displays the message ""from your IP, someone already heads."" But this time the error was ""your IP is not available for voting."" And there was a few servers in different countries."
21-04-2019T02:51:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"only other female in or around the castle without feathers and speaking ability, she’s bound to make a bond"
21-04-2019T02:53:12,iliar,"Hmm ... The number of people who write to me with the question ""why my suggestion was not on the ballot"" is increasing. I have lucky friends."
21-04-2019T02:53:38,Twokinds,"Yeah, they'd be on the final round"
21-04-2019T02:54:26,Twokinds,Keidran are more open than humans. Their definition of platonic might be more flexible.
21-04-2019T02:58:45,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s simple to become close enough to someone you consider them family without knowing them since birth. Seeing yourself or part of yourself in them or putting yourself in their situation can draw you more to making sure they feel accepted into life
21-04-2019T02:59:05,SpazztasticKiwi,or just happy and safe
21-04-2019T03:01:31,Twokinds,Yeah.
21-04-2019T03:02:06,unsteddyphoenix,I appreciate that tom
21-04-2019T03:02:31,unsteddyphoenix,Nice and flexible~
21-04-2019T03:04:10,SpazztasticKiwi,It is a concept I’ve seen in many of my favorites. The movies and books I watch and read and the people I follow generally express or have this with another that I end up taking an interest in
21-04-2019T03:06:46,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s how you can notice good from bullshitery. A connection to not being a complete joke of life and reaching out
21-04-2019T03:07:31,SpazztasticKiwi,"my philosophical babbling aside, I’m going off to bed"
21-04-2019T03:07:34,Bgrmystr2,"back, had to talk about shampoo and stuff"
21-04-2019T03:08:07,Bgrmystr2,"I'd be wondering why people are going to you, iliar, when you have no control over the poll site"
21-04-2019T03:08:14,Bgrmystr2,seems kinda strange
21-04-2019T03:09:55,SpazztasticKiwi,🛌 nite peeps 🐣
21-04-2019T03:12:05,Bgrmystr2,gnight kiwi
21-04-2019T03:14:17,Twokinds,rose personality...
21-04-2019T03:16:15,iliar,"I do not know.  I am often asked questions about Tom ""Hey, you're Tom's friend. Ask him about ....""."
21-04-2019T03:16:16,Twokinds,What's... enjoys messing with people...
21-04-2019T03:16:18,iliar,I have already explained many times that I am not Tom's friend.  I do not do anything special.  I asked this question in a public chat.  Anyone could do this.
21-04-2019T03:17:04,unsteddyphoenix,Prank-y?
21-04-2019T03:17:18,Bgrmystr2,mischevious?
21-04-2019T03:18:22,Bgrmystr2,mischievous* had to look it up
21-04-2019T03:19:31,unsteddyphoenix,Oh thats good
21-04-2019T03:20:43,Bgrmystr2,"good words would also be antics or hijinks, not sure if you'd need to use either one but"
21-04-2019T03:21:34,Bgrmystr2,"I usually have issues thinking of words to describe somethin, I go blank for months lol"
21-04-2019T03:21:57,steelabjur,mischievous impish devilish jaunty naughty playful elfin elvish flippant frolicsome pixieish prankish puckish rascally saucy waggish
21-04-2019T03:22:18,Bgrmystr2,prankish is a word?
21-04-2019T03:22:31,Bgrmystr2,rascally I know
21-04-2019T03:22:40,Bgrmystr2,"..well.. I know of it as wascally, but yeah"
21-04-2019T03:24:24,steelabjur,"I have a bad habit of having a specific word in mind but not being about to get it out, so I invested in a thesaurus and keep it close at hand. ;)"
21-04-2019T03:26:14,steelabjur,"""You wascally wabbit!"""
21-04-2019T03:26:19,Bgrmystr2,yup
21-04-2019T03:27:40,iliar,I've been thinking.  Dogs and wolves are gregarious animals.  There is a leader in the pack. Rose think about Saria as about leader of pack? Right?
21-04-2019T03:28:45,iliar,This may explain her attachment in Saria.
21-04-2019T03:29:32,Twokinds,Could be
21-04-2019T03:30:02,steelabjur,She seemed to defer to her in the material I've seen the pair in (except for Saria's choice of mate ;p)
21-04-2019T03:31:32,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-natsducky:
21-04-2019T03:32:50,steelabjur,"Rose seemed to have rather snide thoughts about ""that Templar boy"""
21-04-2019T03:34:46,TerraTheWizard,didn't expect people to be around this early

21-04-2019T03:35:14,Bgrmystr2,Really Terra? This is a common time for people to talk
21-04-2019T03:35:41,TerraTheWizard,"not usually when i turn up, last message is normally around 6am, and right now it's 9:30"
21-04-2019T03:35:55,Bgrmystr2,"you're get on here at what, between 6 and 8am eastern?"
21-04-2019T03:35:56,steelabjur,Shoo! Hide the good stuff!
21-04-2019T03:36:45,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-nibsbounce:
21-04-2019T03:36:49,Bgrmystr2,"there's lots of times we chat up till the wee hours of the morning like now, but it's usually friday nights and sunday nights."

21-04-2019T03:39:27,iliar,In my time zone is 11:40 AM.  Great time for chat.
21-04-2019T03:39:49,steelabjur,"Got a load of laundry I have to get through the dryer too, so pretty furries and youtube for me until that's dry. ;p"
21-04-2019T03:44:25,TerraTheWizard,"just had a flick through the vod, good stuff :ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:"
21-04-2019T03:46:10,steelabjur,"I came for the foxes I saw in the e-mail, I stayed for young Rose. ;)"
21-04-2019T03:50:33,iliar,Now it seems to me that the relationship between Saria and Rosa is similar to the relationship between the Girl and Her Dog.  Absolutely asexual.  But stronger than ordinary relationships between humans

21-04-2019T11:42:06,CrimsonQuill,I like the reference sheet.
21-04-2019T13:09:12,Mippy,Good afternoon. Eating bulgolgi for lunch
21-04-2019T13:11:11,CrimsonQuill,Hullo Mippy
21-04-2019T13:11:14,CrimsonQuill,How does it taste?
21-04-2019T13:13:30,Mippy,Good
21-04-2019T13:19:00,Mippy,"I mean, for bulgolgi made by Filipinos at an Asian fusion restaurant. XD but I don’t know any Koreans who can cook it for me. Best I can do at home is Momipliers tutorial"
21-04-2019T13:29:01,CrimsonQuill,I was wrecked after last night's stream
21-04-2019T13:29:07,CrimsonQuill,Read my chapter before sleep
21-04-2019T13:29:17,CrimsonQuill,Woken by dad knocking on door to let animals out at 7
21-04-2019T13:29:25,CrimsonQuill,Had breakfast and went back to bed
21-04-2019T13:29:40,CrimsonQuill,Woken up again at 11:00am because I had fallen asleep.

21-04-2019T13:57:50,Azumachan,I think keenspots twitter got hacked or something.
21-04-2019T14:01:34,TerraTheWizard,oh dear
21-04-2019T14:01:39,TerraTheWizard,sure looks like it
21-04-2019T14:24:20,Mippy,Looks like the celeb bot is back....All the celebrity news you never cared about
21-04-2019T14:29:24,Azumachan,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
21-04-2019T14:51:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Anyone tried that waterproofing shoe spray
21-04-2019T14:54:55,Azumachan,is it a quality one ?
21-04-2019T14:59:28,SpazztasticKiwi,I mean has anyone tried a kind at all
21-04-2019T14:59:50,SpazztasticKiwi,And considering my laziness I’d ask for that brand if they did and it worked
21-04-2019T14:59:50,Azumachan,yeah
21-04-2019T15:00:03,Azumachan,leather or fabric ?
21-04-2019T15:00:36,SpazztasticKiwi,The shoes are “genuine leather and mesh”
21-04-2019T15:00:51,SpazztasticKiwi,steel toe if that makes any difference
21-04-2019T15:01:03,Azumachan,nah
21-04-2019T15:01:23,Azumachan,so yeah it works well for that
21-04-2019T15:01:51,Azumachan,you also can mix some bee wax with some tallow.
21-04-2019T15:02:11,Azumachan,its old fashioned but it works wonder on leather.
21-04-2019T15:02:20,TraceLegacyXI,Hey Tom.
21-04-2019T15:03:00,SpazztasticKiwi,I figure I’ll grab some kiwi leather shoe waterproof spray
21-04-2019T15:03:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Provided I don’t forget it

21-04-2019T20:39:20,Mippy,Too much study :ctwokinds-clovisgirl_shake:
21-04-2019T21:09:57,Twokinds,Darn it I misinterpreted this sketch suggestion I think
21-04-2019T21:16:12,unsteddyphoenix,mmmmwhich?
21-04-2019T21:16:21,Mippy,Oops! It happens with writing.
21-04-2019T21:21:23,Twokinds,"I had Natani defending Keith from attackers, but they had competitors."
21-04-2019T21:21:29,Twokinds,Which might mean something different...
21-04-2019T21:22:22,Bgrmystr2,pretty sure they meant like.. similar to Flora protecting Trace from the other tigers that wanted him
21-04-2019T21:22:41,Twokinds,I took it seriously
21-04-2019T21:22:48,Bgrmystr2,that was kind of the feeling I got from the suggestion lol
21-04-2019T21:23:31,unsteddyphoenix,Ahhh lol
21-04-2019T21:24:00,unsteddyphoenix,But...what you were drawing was gonna be so cool...
21-04-2019T21:26:16,Twokinds,Yeah I'm going to keep it this way
21-04-2019T21:26:20,Twokinds,Sorry Storymaker2
21-04-2019T21:26:27,Twokinds,I think they won't mind
21-04-2019T21:27:35,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
21-04-2019T21:30:16,unsteddyphoenix,Heres hoping
21-04-2019T21:30:41,unsteddyphoenix,It makes for a better story
21-04-2019T21:30:44,unsteddyphoenix,:D
21-04-2019T21:30:59,Bgrmystr2,"I mean.. we did see that one feral tiger jump trace out of nowhere, didn't flora have to scare her off?"
21-04-2019T21:31:05,Dadrobit,I could see it being Natani's interpretation
21-04-2019T21:31:35,unsteddyphoenix,Maybe Suitors for keith are just
21-04-2019T21:31:40,unsteddyphoenix,EXTREMELY aggressive
21-04-2019T21:31:41,Dadrobit,Though Natani would probably try poisoning them or somesuch rather than single combat.
21-04-2019T21:31:47,SpazztasticKiwi,I home
21-04-2019T21:31:52,SpazztasticKiwi,With chocolate
21-04-2019T21:32:17,Bgrmystr2,It.. probably wouldn't be out of the ordinary for a feral keidran to be aggressive towards other suitors.
21-04-2019T21:32:19,Dadrobit,Flora went into Feral mode herself IIRC?
21-04-2019T21:32:37,Bgrmystr2,"she didn't, I don't think. it was some kind of battle.. posture.. type deal?"
21-04-2019T21:32:51,Bgrmystr2,I don't think it was the same as feral
21-04-2019T21:33:12,Bgrmystr2,it hasn't been revisted since then so there's too little to go on :u
21-04-2019T21:33:23,Dadrobit,"Ah, yeah, her feral moment was with Sythe"
21-04-2019T21:33:44,Mippy,"Yeah, Tom, even if you misinterpreted one of my suggestions I’d just be happy anyway. Sometimes people see things differently from how you see it yourself...or something. IDK:ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:"
21-04-2019T21:34:10,Mippy,It’s gonna be cool either way
21-04-2019T21:34:32,SpazztasticKiwi,I see you’re much like me in the easily entertained department
21-04-2019T21:34:39,Bgrmystr2,"you gonna have to link it, dadro, cuz I don't think you're thinking of the same as I am"
21-04-2019T21:35:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Did you see the Easter egg video yesterday by the way
21-04-2019T21:35:15,Dadrobit,http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/16/ Feral mode vs Sythe
21-04-2019T21:35:32,Dadrobit,http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/126/ Flora just punches the rando feral Keidran
21-04-2019T21:35:39,Bgrmystr2,ah right yeah huh
21-04-2019T21:36:19,Bgrmystr2,"I guess feral form is not the same as going feral specifically, where flora was talking about how they can't really think or whatever, they lose everything to their instincts"
21-04-2019T21:36:28,Bgrmystr2,I remember that
21-04-2019T21:36:43,Twokinds,Feral form doesn't really exist anymore
21-04-2019T21:36:48,Twokinds,Feral is completely different
21-04-2019T21:37:45,Bgrmystr2,aw
21-04-2019T21:38:02,Bgrmystr2,but at least I was correct in my remembering
21-04-2019T21:39:25,SpazztasticKiwi,"Even at 50% off, Easter candy’s not going too fast"
21-04-2019T21:39:35,Mippy,@SpazztasticKiwi Yes! OMG! I laughed so hard
21-04-2019T21:39:47,SpazztasticKiwi,The slap fight
21-04-2019T21:40:05,SpazztasticKiwi,“Adults” my ass
21-04-2019T21:41:08,SpazztasticKiwi,But they had fun. Though Mark’s reported this afternoon he’s contracted an infection in one of the tooth holes
21-04-2019T21:44:07,Mippy,"Click here to confirm: Yeah, I just saw the update about the antibiotics. I’ve been studying so I missed the post about his teeth"
21-04-2019T21:45:09,Mippy,Ethan messing up the foam and his egg turning pink
21-04-2019T21:46:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Ethan looked lost half the time
21-04-2019T21:47:15,SpazztasticKiwi,And that video on the antibiotics “I am just reading the instructions and I’ve already taken the medicine”
21-04-2019T21:47:18,SpazztasticKiwi,MARK
21-04-2019T21:47:23,Mippy,Ethan...adorable as always. I’m sad he closed his store. I was planning on getting a Wowie hat this summer
21-04-2019T21:48:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Tyler seemed to be the only one with his head on straight
21-04-2019T21:49:11,SpazztasticKiwi,The other two splashed themselves with water - Ethan with boiling water
21-04-2019T21:49:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Thankfully the camera people counted as adult supervision
21-04-2019T21:49:41,Mippy,I wonder when pole dancing 4 is coming out :ctwokinds-floraquestion:
21-04-2019T21:50:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Dear God help them
21-04-2019T21:51:12,SpazztasticKiwi,It seems it’ll be ethen and Tyler with Mark this round but I don’t know if mark was gonna rope Ethan in on the silk dancing first
21-04-2019T21:53:57,Mippy,Oh right! I prid near forget about that.
21-04-2019T21:54:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I want to say Ethan’s gonna be better with his gymnastics background. But they’re both out of any flexibility practice if that makes sense
21-04-2019T21:55:50,Mippy,Make sense to me
21-04-2019T21:56:23,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d try silk dancing. But me and heights don’t get along
21-04-2019T21:56:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh you get to see him try fencing?
21-04-2019T21:56:56,Mippy,I’m pretty sure I’m too fat right now for silk dancing
21-04-2019T21:57:07,SpazztasticKiwi,I loved that teacher. Pull no punches
21-04-2019T21:57:45,Mippy,I haven’t seen the fencing video yet. I’m saving it for after exams.
21-04-2019T21:58:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Well you’ll find out Mark is very blind without his glasses
21-04-2019T21:58:55,SpazztasticKiwi,So am I but that’s why I swapped to contacts permanently
21-04-2019T21:59:07,Mippy,Oh god! Blind man with a pointy stick :ctwokinds-KeithNeat:
21-04-2019T21:59:28,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s just nice they put him in padding
21-04-2019T22:00:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Markmellow man
21-04-2019T22:01:05,Mippy,Pifffttt.....
21-04-2019T22:01:09,Mippy,Lol
21-04-2019T22:03:25,Mippy,I’m thinking of upping my Patreon pledges for the summer. I wonder how Tom and Sage would feel about drawing Phil and Trace cosplaying as each other.
21-04-2019T22:04:29,Bgrmystr2,"probably fine, honestly."
21-04-2019T22:05:29,Twokinds,Actually I went ahead and made two versions
