20-07-2019T08:56:31,CrimsonQuill,:ptv-greetings:
20-07-2019T10:00:00,AspiringNoodle,"We are now *checks calender* two weeks into Zen 2, and it's STILL sold out"
20-07-2019T10:00:22,CrimsonQuill,Zen 2?
20-07-2019T10:00:36,AspiringNoodle,AMD's latest processor
20-07-2019T10:00:52,AspiringNoodle,*insert we've been talking about this for the last month where have you been joke*
20-07-2019T10:00:58,AspiringNoodle,:P
20-07-2019T10:04:17,AspiringNoodle,"Me being a dick aside, AMD must be rolling in that phat Ryzen cash"
20-07-2019T10:06:34,AspiringNoodle,"Oh no, did I bully Quill of Picarto? :ptv-whiny:"
20-07-2019T10:06:49,CrimsonQuill,No it's ok.
20-07-2019T10:06:56,CrimsonQuill,Just hopping between here and SPV3

20-07-2019T10:29:00,AspiringNoodle,"Watching a vid labelled ""7 Unwinnable Boss Fights You Can Beat If You're Good Enough"""
20-07-2019T10:29:04,AspiringNoodle,First entry?
20-07-2019T10:29:05,AspiringNoodle,DARK
20-07-2019T10:29:07,AspiringNoodle,MOTHERF*CKING
20-07-2019T10:29:08,AspiringNoodle,SOULS
20-07-2019T10:29:32,AspiringNoodle,I'm so proud of them *happy cry*
20-07-2019T10:33:04,AspiringNoodle,"For those who don't know, you encounter your first boss fight in the game within 3 minutes of starting"
20-07-2019T10:33:28,CrimsonQuill,I only have Dark souls 3
20-07-2019T10:33:35,AspiringNoodle,"Oh, you missed a treat"
20-07-2019T10:33:36,CrimsonQuill,And I haven't played it
20-07-2019T10:33:39,CrimsonQuill,Yet
20-07-2019T10:33:50,AspiringNoodle,"I now own all 3 dark souls games, but I've only played the first 1"
20-07-2019T10:33:52,CrimsonQuill,But Halo 4 and Reach Legendary...AAAAAAGH
20-07-2019T10:34:03,AspiringNoodle,The Asylum Demon is a living meme
20-07-2019T10:34:21,AspiringNoodle,"""Welcome to Dark Souls, I'll be your tutorial"""

20-07-2019T10:34:29,AspiringNoodle,*SMASH*
20-07-2019T10:34:35,CrimsonQuill,XD
20-07-2019T10:35:00,CrimsonQuill,So what do you think Next Week's stream'll be like?
20-07-2019T10:35:37,AspiringNoodle,"Dark Souls 1 is a mixed bag, imo"
20-07-2019T10:35:42,CrimsonQuill,XD
20-07-2019T10:35:45,AspiringNoodle,The PvE?  Fucking amazing.
20-07-2019T10:35:50,AspiringNoodle,The PvP... we don't talk about that
20-07-2019T10:36:01,CrimsonQuill,Then I shan't talk of it.
20-07-2019T10:36:04,AspiringNoodle,"That said, you can tell the last half of the game was rushed"
20-07-2019T10:36:21,AspiringNoodle,The Demon Ruins in particular are a case of wtf.
20-07-2019T10:36:50,AspiringNoodle,"I still recommend playing it, though :D"
20-07-2019T10:37:02,CrimsonQuill,Okee Dokee
20-07-2019T10:37:20,CrimsonQuill,SPV1 levels are hard
20-07-2019T10:37:29,CrimsonQuill,And the flood are a NIGHTMARE
20-07-2019T10:37:33,AspiringNoodle,"Lol, try playing Dark Souls 1 ;P"
20-07-2019T10:37:48,AspiringNoodle,You'll love the Artorias of the Abyss DLC if you have a split damage weapon
20-07-2019T10:38:03,CrimsonQuill,Help me
20-07-2019T10:38:12,AspiringNoodle,Which game? :P
20-07-2019T10:38:13,CrimsonQuill,Dark Souls sounds terrifying
20-07-2019T10:38:25,AspiringNoodle,The game is renowned for its difficulty
20-07-2019T10:38:35,AspiringNoodle,"That said, there are ways to cheese it for an easier time"
20-07-2019T10:38:37,CrimsonQuill,So I have seen
20-07-2019T10:38:53,AspiringNoodle,The game actually has a hidden difficulty scaling
20-07-2019T10:39:09,AspiringNoodle,"Pure melee builds are the hardest, and pure mage builds are the easiest"
20-07-2019T10:39:25,AspiringNoodle,"Mages do have limited casts for their spells, but they do so much damage it's crazy"
20-07-2019T10:39:27,CrimsonQuill,Good thing I always mix things up
20-07-2019T10:39:44,AspiringNoodle,But there is an advantage to having a pure melee build
20-07-2019T10:39:57,AspiringNoodle,"In PvP, spellcasting is more of a detriment than a benefit"
20-07-2019T10:40:22,AspiringNoodle,Good players will just dodge everything ;)
20-07-2019T10:40:50,CrimsonQuill,That's what my sister does
20-07-2019T10:41:04,CrimsonQuill,She has #3
20-07-2019T10:41:44,AspiringNoodle,"The ironic thing is, Dark Souls 2 is arguably the most mechanically sound of all the Dark Souls games"
20-07-2019T10:41:54,AspiringNoodle,But people absolute hate it the most because of the weak PvE
20-07-2019T10:42:17,CrimsonQuill,Weak PVE?
20-07-2019T10:42:33,AspiringNoodle,"There are a lot of ""boss"" fights that are an utter joke"
20-07-2019T10:42:39,CrimsonQuill,Oh ok
20-07-2019T10:43:41,AspiringNoodle,"It's not bad to have a weak boss.  In Dark Souls, there are several early game bosses that become non-respawning NPCs later on"
20-07-2019T10:43:53,AspiringNoodle,"But when you face them, they will kick your ass"
20-07-2019T10:44:00,CrimsonQuill,I see
20-07-2019T10:44:26,AspiringNoodle,"Dark Souls 2... eh, some bosses are just weak in design"
20-07-2019T10:44:47,AspiringNoodle,"They might surprise you because the boss room came out of nowhere, but once you're over the initial shock, they're pushovers"
20-07-2019T10:45:08,CrimsonQuill,Ok
20-07-2019T10:45:21,CrimsonQuill,"So not smart, not spongey, not hard hitting?"
20-07-2019T10:45:29,AspiringNoodle,Pretty much
20-07-2019T10:45:43,CrimsonQuill,Not good for that reputation.
20-07-2019T10:45:55,AspiringNoodle,"If I remember, the Gluttony Demon is the meme boss of Dark Souls 2"
20-07-2019T10:46:21,CrimsonQuill,Hunters from Halo Reach onwards.
20-07-2019T10:46:23,AspiringNoodle,"It's big, fat, slow, and it's moves are obviously telegraphed"
20-07-2019T10:46:26,CrimsonQuill,Wicked fast
20-07-2019T10:46:30,CrimsonQuill,Hard hitting
20-07-2019T10:46:43,CrimsonQuill,"In 4 especially, it can hit you almost instantly"
20-07-2019T10:46:46,AspiringNoodle,"The funniest thing about the boss is one of its attacks has it eat you, and spit you out, sans gear"
20-07-2019T10:46:58,CrimsonQuill,Ummm...that sounds wrong.
20-07-2019T10:47:01,AspiringNoodle,"You get your gear back, once you kill it :P"
20-07-2019T10:47:41,CrimsonQuill,Bleugh... boss spit
20-07-2019T10:48:38,AspiringNoodle,For Dark Souls Remastered... I'd say play that game offline or with a friend
20-07-2019T10:48:52,CrimsonQuill,Sounds good
20-07-2019T10:48:52,AspiringNoodle,"The game was really poorly designed from a PvP perspective, and an invader will just ruin your day :/"
20-07-2019T10:49:01,CrimsonQuill,Oh...that bad?
20-07-2019T10:49:14,AspiringNoodle,The game has a twink problem
20-07-2019T10:49:42,AspiringNoodle,"In the following game installments, they added an extra parameter to invasions besides soul level, they also added weapon level"
20-07-2019T10:50:16,AspiringNoodle,But that's not entirely the issue.  Dark Souls 1 is the only game with weapon infusions that remove stat scaling
20-07-2019T10:50:29,CrimsonQuill,That means a low soul level player could have a big-arse weapon...
20-07-2019T10:50:35,AspiringNoodle,Yup
20-07-2019T10:50:49,AspiringNoodle,My first dark souls character (who I deleted) loved using the Greataxe
20-07-2019T10:51:02,CrimsonQuill,Two-handed?
20-07-2019T10:51:10,AspiringNoodle,"With a +5 lightning infusion, its attack rating was 350/350 (physical/lightning)"
20-07-2019T10:51:37,AspiringNoodle,That's more than enough to one-shot someone at sl 20 - 25
20-07-2019T10:51:58,CrimsonQuill,I would not want to face you in a game...
20-07-2019T10:52:04,CrimsonQuill,I am bad at games in general.
20-07-2019T10:52:14,AspiringNoodle,"Meh, I'd be more worried about giant dads, lol"
20-07-2019T10:53:34,CrimsonQuill,Got to go now
20-07-2019T10:53:35,CrimsonQuill,Cya
20-07-2019T10:53:36,Dadrobit,Howdy y'all. Off to go see the new The Lion King.
20-07-2019T10:53:42,Dadrobit,Have a good one y'all.

20-07-2019T14:56:47,IronHorseComics,never trust weather predictions
20-07-2019T14:57:25,IronHorseComics,they kept telling us were gonna get a lot of snow the past two winters as the drought finally ended and we still only got rain
20-07-2019T14:58:05,CrimsonQuill,Evening all
20-07-2019T14:58:15,IronHorseComics,the snow just would not come from south it would always come from the north and our local big mountain keeps making the snow bypass us
20-07-2019T14:58:31,CrimsonQuill,Just finished watching the Amazon adaptation of Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman's 'Good Omens'.
20-07-2019T14:58:38,CrimsonQuill,Absolutely beautiful!
20-07-2019T14:59:38,CrimsonQuill,We binged the latter three episodes at once.
20-07-2019T15:02:34,CrimsonQuill,So how are you all?

20-07-2019T15:12:30,CrimsonQuill,XD
20-07-2019T15:12:36,AspiringNoodle,"At this point, I'm about to forsake all rgb fans permanently until the industry sorts out its issues :D"
20-07-2019T15:12:54,CrimsonQuill,"chuckles over another's misfortune, like the sad numpty they are."
20-07-2019T15:13:02,CrimsonQuill,:ctwokinds-eyeroll:
20-07-2019T15:13:10,AspiringNoodle,Try building an RGB pc
20-07-2019T15:13:12,CrimsonQuill,What am I doing with myself these days....
20-07-2019T15:13:24,CrimsonQuill,How hard IS it to build an RPG PC?
20-07-2019T15:13:32,AspiringNoodle,It will be VERY difficult to build a system whose lighting is controlled by one software
20-07-2019T15:13:46,CrimsonQuill,Ooof
20-07-2019T15:13:52,AspiringNoodle,Motherboard / GPU are very simple
20-07-2019T15:14:06,AspiringNoodle,They only work with the manufacturer's proprietary rgb control software
20-07-2019T15:14:12,AspiringNoodle,"Don't like it?  Too bad, fuck you."
20-07-2019T15:14:40,AspiringNoodle,"So if you decide you want an ASUS motherboard and an MSI / Gigabyte gpu, that's already 2 softwares right there"
20-07-2019T15:14:41,CrimsonQuill,Nasty.
20-07-2019T15:16:04,AspiringNoodle,"RAM is pretty universal.  It'll work with any software, even if the company that makes it tends to not work in any other scenario.  So Corsair (who have their own software, iCUE) memory will work with things like ASUS Aura Sync, MSI Mystic Light, and"
20-07-2019T15:16:08,AspiringNoodle,Gigabyte RGB Fusion
20-07-2019T15:17:11,CrimsonQuill,I have 12gb of ram in my laptop
20-07-2019T15:17:15,CrimsonQuill,Helps run Autodesk
20-07-2019T15:17:28,AspiringNoodle,Fans / case lighting is where you run into some minefields
20-07-2019T15:17:32,CrimsonQuill,But bad graphics card means that it remains a potato
20-07-2019T15:17:40,CrimsonQuill,Fans and case lighting...
20-07-2019T15:17:43,CrimsonQuill,Hard to fit?
20-07-2019T15:17:52,AspiringNoodle,eeeeeeeeh
20-07-2019T15:18:06,CrimsonQuill,I'll take that as a 'yes'.
20-07-2019T15:18:08,AspiringNoodle,"Case lighting could be built into the case you buy, or something you add yourself, like RGB strips"
20-07-2019T15:18:25,AspiringNoodle,"Fans are the most annoying issue for me, right now"
20-07-2019T15:18:48,CrimsonQuill,I can guess why....
20-07-2019T15:19:14,AspiringNoodle,"If the answer is, ""Even when buying within the same company, they throw every fan they own at their stack and say 'Fuck it'"", then you'd be right"
20-07-2019T15:19:29,CrimsonQuill,XD
20-07-2019T15:19:37,CrimsonQuill,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
20-07-2019T15:19:54,CrimsonQuill,"Well, I hope you have good luck with the building."
20-07-2019T15:19:58,AspiringNoodle,"Corsair: CPU coolers include mag-lev fans (with and without rgb), and Light Loop fans"
20-07-2019T15:20:09,CrimsonQuill,Mag lev fans?
20-07-2019T15:20:14,CrimsonQuill,Are those like the trains?
20-07-2019T15:20:15,AspiringNoodle,Cases come with either SP120s or LL120s
20-07-2019T15:20:19,CrimsonQuill,Magnetically suspended?
20-07-2019T15:20:26,AspiringNoodle,Exactly
20-07-2019T15:20:35,AspiringNoodle,"Reduced noise, increased performance, and longer life"
20-07-2019T15:20:39,CrimsonQuill,I see. That's actually pretty cool.
20-07-2019T15:21:28,AspiringNoodle,"The reason I'm annoyed is that you're generally supposed to match up fans, especially when RGB is involved"
20-07-2019T15:21:43,AspiringNoodle,"If you have one fan with 4 leds and one with 12, the software won't know what to do"
20-07-2019T15:22:08,AspiringNoodle,"So if you want a nice coordinated build, you'll want all the fans to be the same"
20-07-2019T15:22:35,CrimsonQuill,Oh. So it's like trying to make a car with the wrong parts...
20-07-2019T15:22:38,CrimsonQuill,Makes sense.
20-07-2019T15:22:57,AspiringNoodle,And Corsair intentionally sells all their shit in such a way that you'll end up buying their fans SOMEWHERE along the line
20-07-2019T15:24:33,CrimsonQuill,Kind of weird...
20-07-2019T15:24:37,CrimsonQuill,yawns
20-07-2019T15:24:44,CrimsonQuill,I have to head to bed...
20-07-2019T15:24:50,CrimsonQuill,I'm a bit tired.
20-07-2019T15:24:55,CrimsonQuill,Weeelll....
20-07-2019T15:25:03,CrimsonQuill,When I say 'Head to Bed'....
20-07-2019T15:25:20,CrimsonQuill,I really mean 'Re-read my favourite moments of Twokinds'...
20-07-2019T15:25:40,CrimsonQuill,Is that ok?
20-07-2019T15:26:19,AspiringNoodle,lol
20-07-2019T15:26:26,CrimsonQuill,"Yeah, I know."

20-07-2019T17:31:39,AspiringNoodle,"And Teapot, it wouldn't be so bad if Corsiar offered the fans I wanted either on the case or the cpu cooler"
20-07-2019T17:34:35,SpazztasticKiwi,“pirate pawn”
20-07-2019T17:34:39,SpazztasticKiwi,shop
20-07-2019T17:34:44,SpazztasticKiwi,anyone else see the joke
20-07-2019T17:36:13,SpazztasticKiwi,side note it may be a new goal of mine to get a massive truck
20-07-2019T17:36:39,SpazztasticKiwi,just jacked as high as legal. and see how the compensation jokes roll out
20-07-2019T17:56:33,AspiringNoodle,You sound like my dad xD
20-07-2019T17:57:03,AspiringNoodle,I'm the opposite.  My first car was an suv.  My current car is a compact car.  I like the compact more.  The only thing I miss is the hatch.
20-07-2019T17:57:07,AspiringNoodle,Next car will be a hatchback :D
20-07-2019T18:04:12,IronHorseComics,*backs in&
20-07-2019T18:43:28,MisterWho,"Wow, i think that's the first time i've seen Tom on a picture. #SDCC2019"
20-07-2019T18:44:25,IronHorseComics,I've seen him in a video with mark but it had been a while
20-07-2019T18:44:55,MisterWho,https://twitter.com/HoSalamanstra/status/1153040612561575936
20-07-2019T18:45:37,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s been other con pictures
20-07-2019T18:46:10,SpazztasticKiwi,you totally gotta follow his Twitter to see more
20-07-2019T18:46:32,SpazztasticKiwi,*cough* not a pro mo
20-07-2019T18:47:52,MisterWho,"oh i do, i do. Sometimes i really have to visit AC."
20-07-2019T18:57:52,Ordithus,That Kat print tho :ctwokinds-KatDance:
20-07-2019T18:58:46,IronHorseComics,can't wait to see his sketchbook posts this year
20-07-2019T18:58:58,IronHorseComics,he's had some good ones over the past few years
20-07-2019T19:06:00,SpazztasticKiwi,anyone know if you can hide and lock chunks of word docs
20-07-2019T19:06:36,Ordithus,"Never done that with Word, only Excel"
20-07-2019T19:13:00,AspiringNoodle,...I want to build my computer even faster now ;_;
20-07-2019T19:13:27,AspiringNoodle,"I swear, I'm paranoid that this computer is going to die once I really get going"
20-07-2019T19:15:25,AspiringNoodle,Anyone else read Hunters of Salamanstra?
20-07-2019T19:15:37,Ordithus,yeah!
20-07-2019T19:15:48,AspiringNoodle,I recognized the art style immediately <3
20-07-2019T19:16:42,Ordithus,Tom sketched one of HoS's characters too https://twitter.com/TwoKinds/status/1153017551858700289
20-07-2019T19:18:05,IronHorseComics,I have not read it
20-07-2019T19:20:57,AspiringNoodle,"I've only read the first few pages, but it's pretty fucking dark to start"
20-07-2019T19:21:12,AspiringNoodle,"That said, I like the writing, the style, so I added it to my list :)"
20-07-2019T19:21:59,Ordithus,"It's good.  Lots of dark, split up by some cute."
20-07-2019T19:25:53,AspiringNoodle,"Ord, I've learned a very hard lesson recently, lol"
20-07-2019T19:26:13,AspiringNoodle,It's better to build a computer at your own leisure than be forced into it by circumstance
20-07-2019T19:26:21,AspiringNoodle,Also storage.  Buy lots of storage ;_;
20-07-2019T19:26:34,Ordithus,Can never have too much
20-07-2019T19:26:42,AspiringNoodle,I have 237GB of usable space :D
20-07-2019T19:26:58,AspiringNoodle,"Because sir dumb-dumb here only ever bought the 1 ssd, lmao"
20-07-2019T19:27:11,AspiringNoodle,That said... not making the same mistake twice!
20-07-2019T19:32:25,Bgrmystr2,it's also a good idea to buy your system all at once
20-07-2019T19:32:27,Bgrmystr2,and not over time.
20-07-2019T19:32:30,Bgrmystr2,just FYI
20-07-2019T19:33:09,Ordithus,Also don't put off getting parts warrantied
20-07-2019T19:33:13,Bgrmystr2,"don't buy piece by piece over months or a year, cuz you're just going to see sales for the stuff you already got 3 months prior that you're simply not using at all and is sitting in your room unopened."
20-07-2019T19:33:26,Bgrmystr2,or new stuff better than yours will release for the same price
20-07-2019T19:34:04,Bgrmystr2,"I've never been sold by the extended warranty, but buying all together also gives everything the same 30 days to test and confirm it works."
20-07-2019T19:40:53,AspiringNoodle,"So far, I've only bought the power supply"
20-07-2019T19:41:02,AspiringNoodle,Got that 850W EVGA one for $110 :D
20-07-2019T19:41:56,AspiringNoodle,"That said, I'm still mulling over cases / case fans / cpu coolers.  But I am checking in every so often to see if the 3900X is back in stock"
20-07-2019T19:42:58,AspiringNoodle,"The moment either that or the 2080 supers are available, I'm firing off an order for that, the mobo, ram, and memory"
20-07-2019T19:43:35,AspiringNoodle,At which point I'll be forced to make up my damn mind and pick out the rest of the stuff ;)
20-07-2019T19:45:41,AspiringNoodle,Speak of the devil...
20-07-2019T19:45:52,AspiringNoodle,RTX Super ad before my youtube video
20-07-2019T19:47:29,IronHorseComics,that's why you get ad blocker
20-07-2019T19:58:47,AspiringNoodle,"Lol, I don't mind most ads"
20-07-2019T19:59:00,AspiringNoodle,"Except truth.org ads, fuck them -_-"
20-07-2019T19:59:14,Yevni,@aspiringnoodle Every time I see you in chat I want udon
20-07-2019T19:59:24,AspiringNoodle,...that sounds so good
20-07-2019T19:59:30,Yevni,EXACTLY
20-07-2019T19:59:42,AspiringNoodle,And I know a place ~20 min from my house where I can get some ;P
20-07-2019T20:00:02,Ordithus,saaaame but dinner is almost ready
20-07-2019T20:00:07,Yevni,My hometown had this one family joint that had the best tasting udon I've had. I miss that place
20-07-2019T20:00:15,AspiringNoodle,I ate not too long ago.  :(
20-07-2019T20:00:47,SpazztasticKiwi,so did anyone know about locking doc sections
20-07-2019T20:01:11,Ordithus,'fraid not
20-07-2019T20:03:32,IronHorseComics,nope
20-07-2019T20:21:00,SpazztasticKiwi,found the perfect leaf for my rosy maple moth display
20-07-2019T20:21:17,SpazztasticKiwi,nicely marbled with orange and red
20-07-2019T20:21:45,SpazztasticKiwi,till I get home and wait - that’s not a maple leaf
20-07-2019T20:23:06,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-rose::maple_leaf::butterfly:
20-07-2019T20:40:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I wonder if Tom has this kind of fun writing
20-07-2019T20:41:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve gone back near three times now writing my chunks I’ve thought of today with “what were you wearing again?”
20-07-2019T20:55:44,AspiringNoodle,"During a Chu stream, I pulled a backstory for a D&D character out my bum on the spot :D"
20-07-2019T20:55:57,AspiringNoodle,"Long story short, lots of people died. Mwahahahahahaha"
20-07-2019T20:56:01,AspiringNoodle,...:c
20-07-2019T21:12:27,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m not writing d&d anything but ok I guess
20-07-2019T21:12:44,SpazztasticKiwi,writing’s writing
20-07-2019T21:22:58,AspiringNoodle,"Tbh, I'm surprised I haven't taken up writing in some capacity"
20-07-2019T21:23:28,AspiringNoodle,English was one of the easiest classes for me to get an A in throughout all my schooling
20-07-2019T21:23:46,AspiringNoodle,"Then again, writing papers for a class isn't the same as creative writing, so I suppose I'm conflating the two :/"
20-07-2019T21:36:00,AspiringNoodle,"Hmmmm, personal question"
20-07-2019T21:36:06,AspiringNoodle,What's your favorite type of story?
20-07-2019T22:11:33,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
20-07-2019T22:32:23,SpazztasticKiwi,there’s not really any stories with just romance or whatever
20-07-2019T22:32:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I watch too much horror to be healthy
20-07-2019T22:33:01,SpazztasticKiwi,but reading and anime is things like Fruits Basket
20-07-2019T22:33:59,SpazztasticKiwi,mythology and non blood related family becoming a home
20-07-2019T22:34:45,SpazztasticKiwi,granted Kyo and Touru are hopefully ending up together since they’re saying they’re following the entirety of the manga with this reboot but we’ll see
20-07-2019T22:39:08,SpazztasticKiwi,then it’s Kakuriyo no Yadomeshi n Inuyasha n Kamisama Kiss n Inu x Buku - similar stuff & it’s either that or I have an eye for male characters with white hair and ears
20-07-2019T22:39:50,AspiringNoodle,"If you watch Blue Exorcist, you'll get black hair and a tail ;D"
20-07-2019T22:39:59,AspiringNoodle,"Also pointy ears, but I assume you mean animal ears, lol"
20-07-2019T23:12:22,SpazztasticKiwi,well any kind of ears is good on a man
20-07-2019T23:12:30,SpazztasticKiwi,or humans for that matter
20-07-2019T23:15:49,AspiringNoodle,*sigh*
20-07-2019T23:16:01,AspiringNoodle,"Another day, still no 3900x :c"
20-07-2019T23:51:53,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-sleepy:
