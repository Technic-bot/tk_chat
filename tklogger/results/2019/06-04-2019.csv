06-04-2019T15:59:47,FloofyCat,Halo 4 was kinda disappointing but it was reaching the end of what the 360 could deliver really.

06-04-2019T16:00:24,FloofyCat,I never got a next gen console because I had Mount & Blade: Warband and that's all I needed.

06-04-2019T16:00:47,FloofyCat,"The Halo 4 as a game was okay, the story was awful, the new arc was awful, the enemies were awful."

06-04-2019T16:42:46,Twokinds,Depends? They're less intellegent than Keidran.
06-04-2019T16:42:51,iTwoKindsiFunny,Does Tom have Carpel Tunnel?
06-04-2019T16:43:04,RimaDraws,carpel tunnel sucks

06-04-2019T16:43:18,Ordithus,"As in, animal intelligence, or just dumb hooman?"
06-04-2019T16:43:35,MuonNeutrino,but less intelligent in a 'they're a bit dim' way or in a 'they're animals' way?
06-04-2019T16:43:39,tehbear,clearly golems are dumb as rocks. but they got a heart of gold
06-04-2019T16:43:41,CrimsonQuill,@Drazgon This is your suggestion? Congrats!
06-04-2019T16:43:44,RimaDraws,<3  ord

06-04-2019T16:43:48,unsteddyphoenix,"canthey talk, basically"
06-04-2019T16:43:51,Mippy,Every time a Tom gets Carpal Tunnel a new Tom replaces him
06-04-2019T16:43:57,Bgrmystr2,they can make noises
06-04-2019T16:44:01,Bgrmystr2,that's good enough eh?
06-04-2019T16:44:05,Twokinds,"They're not quite animals, but less than human."
06-04-2019T16:44:05,Bgrmystr2,just form that into words
06-04-2019T16:44:07,CrimsonQuill,"@tehbear You should see Dorfl in ""Feet of Clay"""
06-04-2019T16:44:09,Twokinds,They're about inbetween.
06-04-2019T16:44:09,MarvTheHugPharaoh,He's prefect
06-04-2019T16:44:22,Ordithus,Hmm
06-04-2019T16:44:26,MuonNeutrino,"hm, interesting"
06-04-2019T16:44:28,unsteddyphoenix,so...theyre keidran
06-04-2019T16:44:32,tehbear,oh. Terry Pratchet. Cool!
06-04-2019T16:44:33,MuonNeutrino,so kinda a spot that doesnt really exist in our world?
06-04-2019T16:44:41,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-flomad: das racist stedy
06-04-2019T16:44:46,Twokinds,"No, Keidran and humans are generally on the same level."
06-04-2019T16:44:47,CrimsonQuill,@tehbear You read it? Another fan!
06-04-2019T16:44:58,Twokinds,"Or I should say, they're both capable of the same range of intellegence."
06-04-2019T16:45:05,BadFoMo,They're like Fallout 1 Super Mutents?
06-04-2019T16:45:05,tehbear,i listened to the first one on audiobook. i should get back to the series!
06-04-2019T16:45:05,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno, Muon. There are a LOT of animals that are really damn smart."
06-04-2019T16:45:09,MuonNeutrino,lore! \o/
06-04-2019T16:45:12,Twokinds,But it'd be a very rare lizardfolk who ever came close to the average keidran or human.
06-04-2019T16:45:20,CatzArt,I see Basitins were left out there Tom
06-04-2019T16:45:21,Ordithus,Maybe they're like a dolphin?
06-04-2019T16:45:23,CrimsonQuill,That's interesting.
06-04-2019T16:45:25,Ordithus,Dolphins are crazy smart
06-04-2019T16:45:26,unsteddyphoenix,"hm,I see"
06-04-2019T16:45:30,CrimsonQuill,@CatzArt you're back!
06-04-2019T16:45:35,MuonNeutrino,are lizardfolk capable of language use?
06-04-2019T16:45:39,unsteddyphoenix,Theyre like...orcs
06-04-2019T16:45:40,CrRAR,Think: dumb dolphin
06-04-2019T16:45:41,Bgrmystr2,yeah Ord
06-04-2019T16:45:42,CrimsonQuill,I stroked Dolphins.
06-04-2019T16:45:47,CrimsonQuill,"I'm not joking,"

06-04-2019T16:45:54,BadFoMo,"@Twokinds So, Fallout 1 Super Mutints?"
06-04-2019T16:45:55,CrimsonQuill,"Common Dolphins, in Belmullet."
06-04-2019T16:45:56,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-ohmy:

06-04-2019T16:46:03,CrimsonQuill,They were in a shallow bay.
06-04-2019T16:46:14,Dadrobit,Back for a hot second.
06-04-2019T16:46:15,BluePhantom90,so the statue is a male statue?
06-04-2019T16:46:17,CrimsonQuill,@CatzArt I see.
06-04-2019T16:46:19,MarvTheHugPharaoh,wb father <3

06-04-2019T16:46:26,CrimsonQuill,Welcome Back robit
06-04-2019T16:46:27,BadFoMo,Sorry to say it twice.
06-04-2019T16:46:29,MuonNeutrino,so the real question is if the statue is more or less intelligent than a lizardfolk >.>
06-04-2019T16:46:31,unsteddyphoenix,ay daddy
06-04-2019T16:46:49,BadFoMo,"Also, welcome back."
06-04-2019T16:47:00,Bgrmystr2,"probably less, since I kinda doubt lizardfolk are gonna be too much less intelligent than humans or keidran"
06-04-2019T16:47:04,Mippy,Dad we just learned Quill strokes dolphins
06-04-2019T16:47:10,Dadrobit,giggity

06-04-2019T16:47:14,tehbear,"its a statue, so not really comparable to actual lizardoflk"
06-04-2019T16:47:16,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I missed something
06-04-2019T16:47:17,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-keith8D:

06-04-2019T16:47:35,MuonNeutrino,i was mostly joking heh

06-04-2019T16:47:46,Bgrmystr2,on her face?
06-04-2019T16:47:51,CrimsonQuill,The wild dolphins had swum into the bay.
06-04-2019T16:47:54,iTwoKindsiFunny,her pupils
06-04-2019T16:48:01,MuonNeutrino,she's never drawn with pupils

06-04-2019T16:48:03,BatboyEXE,Hopefully stomach pains go away
06-04-2019T16:48:07,Bgrmystr2,you can't see em
06-04-2019T16:48:11,CrimsonQuill,It was a complete chance that I got to do it.
06-04-2019T16:48:12,MuonNeutrino,her eyes are always drawn featureless iirc
06-04-2019T16:48:12,Ordithus,"Golem is an advanced magical automaton, like a fancy robot"
06-04-2019T16:48:15,CrimsonQuill,"Also, pupils?"
06-04-2019T16:48:18,Mippy,Got me some Tang
06-04-2019T16:48:27,Dadrobit,"I think I remember a scientist who had to call off a study of her dolphin because the dolphin got too interested in her ""stroking"" him that he wouldn't be cooperative anymore without it."
06-04-2019T16:48:28,MuonNeutrino,"or... almost always? usually, anyway"
06-04-2019T16:48:33,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-NoraEyebrows: <-- pupils
06-04-2019T16:48:48,iTwoKindsiFunny,see
06-04-2019T16:48:49,Bgrmystr2,"yeah sometimes, not always"
06-04-2019T16:48:55,CrimsonQuill,"That's interesting, Dadrobit. So it demanded too much attention?"
06-04-2019T16:48:56,Ordithus,"It's a sketch, and besides it isn't done"
06-04-2019T16:49:06,Dadrobit,.... Yes..... Attention...

06-04-2019T16:50:42,Ordithus,This is one affectionate golem <3
06-04-2019T16:50:48,CrimsonQuill,Am I straying into dangerous territory?
06-04-2019T16:50:50,Bgrmystr2,probably not the kind of attention we speak of here lolol

06-04-2019T17:41:09,w0lfmare,Two kinds of people. Men and women. Turns into a melodrama comedy
06-04-2019T17:41:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Well was it really “TwoKinds”? There was technically three species starting out
06-04-2019T17:41:34,CrimsonQuill,"Oooh, Tom pick"
06-04-2019T17:41:36,CrRAR,Don't. forget. Dragons.
06-04-2019T17:41:39,Mippy,Quill...leaving out Basitin
06-04-2019T17:41:39,Twokinds,Well Twokinds isn't referring to the number of species

06-04-2019T17:41:43,Ordithus,And lizardfolk
06-04-2019T17:41:50,Twokinds,It's about relationships that form between two different kinds of people.
06-04-2019T17:41:50,CrimsonQuill,@Mippy They're people too
06-04-2019T17:41:52,SpazztasticKiwi,That I gathered
06-04-2019T17:41:53,CrimsonQuill,I just forgot
06-04-2019T17:41:54,FloofyCat,What is Twokinds referring to..? Halfkinds bei- oh.

06-04-2019T17:42:23,FloofyCat,Two kinds of people: Derpy blue triangle faced people and tsundere tiger girls.
06-04-2019T17:42:30,Twokinds,It's also about people who have two sides to themselves.
06-04-2019T17:42:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I figured it meant there’s two kinds of people in there’s racist and normal no matter the species
06-04-2019T17:42:36,Ordithus,Hi Peachyu

06-04-2019T17:45:03,Bgrmystr2,tom doesn't multistream on patreon streams
06-04-2019T17:45:04,CrimsonQuill,It looks like it.
06-04-2019T17:45:09,MuonNeutrino,"i mean maddie could too, i suppose, but the suggestion said kat"
06-04-2019T17:45:13,FloofyCat,Are puns war crimes around here?
06-04-2019T17:45:22,SageSaga,they should be
06-04-2019T17:45:23,Andromedian1,I hope not
06-04-2019T17:45:24,Ordithus,They are the highest of crime

06-04-2019T17:47:38,BadFoMo,Nope!
06-04-2019T17:47:38,CrimsonQuill,This is going to be a good sketch
06-04-2019T17:47:54,SageSaga,nah - its for everyone to watch- but all the art is Patreon requests and such
06-04-2019T17:47:58,Peachyu,ye uwu but if we can stream some other time too thats nice~ cause i dot stream every friday
06-04-2019T17:47:59,CrimsonQuill,I'll try Raine and Red again next week.
06-04-2019T17:48:04,CrimsonQuill,"Oooh, poor Keith..."
06-04-2019T17:48:08,Peachyu,ohh got it
06-04-2019T17:48:26,SageSaga,I only stream Friday and Sat- any other streams are random and usually someone inviting me
06-04-2019T17:48:32,FloofyCat,"Patreons make suggestions, then everyone can watch and vote before they're drawn."
06-04-2019T17:48:37,BadFoMo,I'll do the same with mine.
06-04-2019T17:48:48,CrimsonQuill,Is Keith the misfortune magnet in the comic?
06-04-2019T17:48:49,Peachyu,ohh ur important my frien
06-04-2019T17:49:21,BadFoMo,I think he was for a bit.
06-04-2019T17:49:25,SageSaga,Keith is the Sasuke of the group
06-04-2019T17:49:36,BadFoMo,Who?
06-04-2019T17:49:36,Mippy,Quill...we all know Keith should probably have some antidepressants...no need to rub it in
06-04-2019T17:49:47,CrimsonQuill,He needs a nice hot cuppa.
06-04-2019T17:49:48,RimaDraws,no red is sage
06-04-2019T17:49:51,CrimsonQuill,And some biscuits.
06-04-2019T17:49:56,Peachyu,a
06-04-2019T17:50:00,SageSaga,no - Red is too goofy to be a Sasuke
06-04-2019T17:50:01,BadFoMo,That name sounds framilar though.
06-04-2019T17:50:15,Ordithus,"Keith has Natani now, he's good (now that Nat is back)"
06-04-2019T17:50:16,SageSaga,Red is like- Bug Boy
06-04-2019T17:50:19,RimaDraws,to me he is. keith is like idk. maybe the neji
06-04-2019T17:50:32,Peachyu,@Ordithus are you a picarto mod?
06-04-2019T17:50:35,SageSaga,Red is Shino
06-04-2019T17:50:41,RimaDraws,but naruto is a bit meh anyway
06-04-2019T17:50:45,CrimsonQuill,"""Shino?"""
06-04-2019T17:50:52,SageSaga,exactly Crimson
06-04-2019T17:50:53,Bgrmystr2,Ord is a mod for tom's stream
06-04-2019T17:50:54,RimaDraws,shino bug boy from naruto
06-04-2019T17:50:58,Bgrmystr2,not for picarto
06-04-2019T17:51:10,Bgrmystr2,picarto staff have a unique icon for themselves
06-04-2019T17:51:16,CrimsonQuill,Never watched Naruto.
06-04-2019T17:51:26,RimaDraws,it gets better in shippuden
06-04-2019T17:51:38,Mippy,Why am I reading mod A’s mood? :ctwokinds-floraquestion:
06-04-2019T17:51:41,Ordithus,@Peachyu Just for Tom
06-04-2019T17:52:27,Mippy,Shippuden got a bit silly with the zombies
06-04-2019T17:52:33,Ordithus,"And for anyone who multis with him, too"
06-04-2019T17:52:58,SageSaga,Naruto minus the filler is actually a really good shonen

06-04-2019T17:53:35,BadFoMo,"Oh, Naruto. I've never really watched that. The only ""Bug Boy"" in anime that I knew of was that one clone in Read Or Die."
06-04-2019T17:53:37,CrimsonQuill,I am heading off to bed.
06-04-2019T17:53:41,BadFoMo,Good night.
06-04-2019T17:53:42,Mippy,Naruto definitely had its moments
06-04-2019T17:53:49,CrimsonQuill,"I need to sleep, it's almost midnight..."
06-04-2019T17:53:50,CrRAR,Maybe Natani pops up with that stick that occasionally appears to cheer Keith up.
06-04-2019T17:54:04,CrimsonQuill,Sleep well everyone! Good Night! :ptv-greetings::ptv-victory::ptv-sleepy::ptv-sleepy::ptv-sleepy:

06-04-2019T17:54:26,RimaDraws,bye quill
06-04-2019T17:54:31,NeonMitsumi,Night Quill
06-04-2019T17:54:36,SageSaga,Naruto also had some awesome open and end songs
06-04-2019T17:54:36,Mippy,Don’t skimp on the maths
06-04-2019T17:54:42,Peachyu,@Ordithus oh gotcha is just that you have two mods icons thats why i asked <3
06-04-2019T17:54:53,SageSaga,and some of the action animation was top notch
06-04-2019T17:54:59,CrRAR,two mod icons is a bug xD
06-04-2019T17:55:08,NeonMitsumi,Mods too OP
06-04-2019T17:55:21,FoxxTrotter,It's because Ord is a subscriber. That's why there's two icons.
06-04-2019T17:55:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I liked bug boy
06-04-2019T17:55:34,SageSaga,their Sakuga animation was amazing even if people made fun of the inbetweens a lot

06-04-2019T17:56:09,RimaDraws,i think she should have ended up with naruto
06-04-2019T17:56:11,SpazztasticKiwi,He was attractive till I thought of the fact he was literally made of bugs
06-04-2019T17:56:18,SageSaga,no way
06-04-2019T17:56:22,SageSaga,Hinata is best girl
06-04-2019T17:56:23,FoxxTrotter,Anyone who is a subscriber will show two icons next to their name on the user list.
06-04-2019T17:56:25,Mippy,I actually like Sakura
06-04-2019T17:56:26,SageSaga,and he got Her
06-04-2019T17:56:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I liked how they paired Naruto
06-04-2019T17:56:40,RimaDraws,yes hinata is best girl. i despised sakura so much after how she treated naruto
06-04-2019T17:56:53,SageSaga,she changed
06-04-2019T17:56:58,Alphawolf333,I may have only watched like a tenth of Naruto but I have to agree with Sage
06-04-2019T17:57:00,Mippy,She grew up
06-04-2019T17:57:02,RimaDraws,and i dont care for sasuke because he can
06-04-2019T17:57:06,SageSaga,Sakura was pretty cool in late Shipuden
06-04-2019T17:57:08,RimaDraws,cant change
06-04-2019T17:57:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Sakuras appeal kinda died for me after awhile. Like Sasuke
06-04-2019T17:57:18,SageSaga,Sasuke does change though-
06-04-2019T17:57:22,RimaDraws,she was ok. but i knew she deserved to be put down by naruto
06-04-2019T17:57:26,RimaDraws,i still dont trust sasuke
06-04-2019T17:57:34,SageSaga,Sasuke is awesome in Boruto :D
06-04-2019T17:57:36,FloofyCat,"If this sketch was canon, Keith will probably achieve Jon Snow levels of brooding."
06-04-2019T17:57:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Isn’t the whole thing done
06-04-2019T17:57:46,RimaDraws,yea but i still dont like him i used to tho
06-04-2019T17:57:55,Mippy,I have to catch up with Boruto
06-04-2019T17:57:55,SageSaga,him trying to relate with his daughter is funny
06-04-2019T17:58:08,RimaDraws,saruda = salad in japanese
06-04-2019T17:58:10,RimaDraws,LOL
06-04-2019T17:58:38,Mippy,She is a Sasuke/Sakura salad so it makes sense
06-04-2019T17:58:38,SpazztasticKiwi,I stopped watching with just a toe dip in Shippuden
06-04-2019T17:58:40,SageSaga,"""Do you- Do you like candy?"" ""Im not a baby dad!"" *omg i can kill everyone in this city but i cant make my daughter smile!*"
06-04-2019T17:58:53,RimaDraws,yea he can definitely do that
06-04-2019T17:59:32,SageSaga,as an adult hes a great character- as a kid he was a pain in the butt emo boy
06-04-2019T18:00:15,RimaDraws,he still is to me till i watch boruto
06-04-2019T18:00:21,FloofyCat,I wonder what Keith would do if this was canon.
06-04-2019T18:00:37,FloofyCat,What does everyone else think he'd do..?
06-04-2019T18:00:46,Mippy,Yeah...kids and teens often go through a “edgier the thow” phase

06-04-2019T18:01:17,NeonMitsumi,Well... nothing would change.
06-04-2019T18:01:19,Ordithus,It fits entirely with the canon

06-04-2019T18:04:04,SpazztasticKiwi,"Speaking of anime, I got a few more of the one I found last night and it’s done"
06-04-2019T18:04:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Might jump over to it in a minute
06-04-2019T18:04:31,SageSaga,Mob Psycho 100 is must watch
06-04-2019T18:04:40,Eternity1,yes it is
06-04-2019T18:04:46,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve discovered I might have a type
06-04-2019T18:05:31,Alphawolf333,Mob Psycho was good
06-04-2019T18:05:33,FloofyCat,"Anime is weird. You watch a series, then think nothing can top it, then you are pleasantly surprised."
06-04-2019T18:05:50,FloofyCat,But it's really hard to find something to top what you've already watched.
06-04-2019T18:06:04,Ordithus,When did this stream get so heavy :ctwokinds-LauraCry:
06-04-2019T18:06:09,FloofyCat,Unless you go full NEET and slow time to a crawl.
06-04-2019T18:06:22,Combak,Ord: About 30 minutes ago.
06-04-2019T18:06:36,SpazztasticKiwi,The suggestions I’ve gotten from my watched stuff are generally focused on a main male lead that’s at least half demon with white hair and ears
06-04-2019T18:06:59,BadFoMo,InuYasha?
06-04-2019T18:07:02,FloofyCat,"I love the heavier stuff, shows the universe isn't always sunshines and rainbows."
06-04-2019T18:07:09,RimaDraws,inuyasha is ok
06-04-2019T18:07:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Kamisama Hajimemashita
06-04-2019T18:07:25,SpazztasticKiwi,And Inu X Buku SD

06-04-2019T18:07:47,FloofyCat,"I mean isn't sunshine and rainbows, but you get the point."
06-04-2019T18:07:47,BadFoMo,I use to Obsess ofer that show.
06-04-2019T18:08:02,Mippy,Need to catch up with Sheild Hero
06-04-2019T18:08:02,Bgrmystr2,lol Floofy it's not hard to find something that tops the shows you've watched if you don't watch many shows.
06-04-2019T18:08:11,Bgrmystr2,"cuz there's so many good ones, you're bound to find one better."
06-04-2019T18:08:12,RimaDraws,this looks great tom!
06-04-2019T18:08:16,Bgrmystr2,eventually they all just blend together.
06-04-2019T18:08:19,SpazztasticKiwi,But Inuyasha is what seems to be what it’s circling around in terms of ideas I get thrown
06-04-2019T18:08:20,FloofyCat,"Bgr, depends on tastes really."
06-04-2019T18:08:29,Bgrmystr2,"hmm, I doubt that"
06-04-2019T18:08:44,Bgrmystr2,cuz it only matters how much you've watched
06-04-2019T18:09:01,FloofyCat,"There's only so much out there that really clicks with someone, unless everything clicks with you."
06-04-2019T18:09:03,SpazztasticKiwi,I generally don’t discuss it since not many are either interested if they even know what I’m talking about
06-04-2019T18:09:22,Bgrmystr2,"there's so much out there that that's kinda not really relevant, thankfully"
06-04-2019T18:09:26,Bgrmystr2,SO much shows.
06-04-2019T18:09:54,SageSaga,Bgr- what if your only intrest is in animes about a restaurant in another world? Then you only have like - 3 animes to watch
06-04-2019T18:10:26,Bgrmystr2,"lool, aren't there way more than 3?"
06-04-2019T18:10:29,Mippy,As someone who enjoyed Keijo! I...don’t deserve a opinion
06-04-2019T18:10:59,WereKeidran,back

06-04-2019T18:11:45,SageSaga,who hurt you?
06-04-2019T18:11:51,Bgrmystr2,I'm afraid of watching that.

06-04-2019T18:12:01,RimaDraws,it is hilarious
06-04-2019T18:12:03,RimaDraws,and good surprisingly
06-04-2019T18:12:10,RimaDraws,and i will!
06-04-2019T18:12:15,FloofyCat,"Mediocre is amazing to someone and yeah, it's all subjective really."
06-04-2019T18:12:17,SageSaga,Rima's been brain washed
06-04-2019T18:12:24,RimaDraws,no i havent

06-04-2019T18:12:44,RimaDraws,i told him i didnt want to lol
06-04-2019T18:12:48,SageSaga,we will avenge your tastes Rima
06-04-2019T18:13:08,SageSaga,Dadro will pay
06-04-2019T18:13:10,RimaDraws,at least you're making me laugh right now because i am in a bad spot right now with my emotions
06-04-2019T18:13:15,FloofyCat,Is it against the TK Chat Geneva Convention to ask for everyone's favourite anime?
06-04-2019T18:13:18,Bgrmystr2,"I think you severely underestimate how many shows there are, Floofy. There's enough amazing shows out there and plenty enough good shows that are just under the bar of amazing"
06-04-2019T18:13:36,Ordithus,Cowboy Bebop
06-04-2019T18:13:46,RimaDraws,bebop i recommend

06-04-2019T18:14:12,FloofyCat,"I guess Bgr, although it takes a good 3-5 episodes to know if something is going to be worth the time"

06-04-2019T18:14:15,Mippy,@FloofyCat For nostalgic reasons...CardCaptor Sakura
06-04-2019T18:14:16,SageSaga,i can only recommend things if i know what a person likes- because i know too many great animes

06-04-2019T18:14:21,Ordithus,Nicely done
06-04-2019T18:14:26,RimaDraws,i know a few
06-04-2019T18:14:28,Alphawolf333,I'd say my favorite is Spice and Wolf
06-04-2019T18:14:29,FloofyCat,Awesome work \o/
06-04-2019T18:14:34,Bgrmystr2,"I'd disagree, some shows don't begin to get started after 4-5 episodes"
06-04-2019T18:14:38,FloofyCat,It's nice and sad
06-04-2019T18:14:40,RimaDraws,i am a sailor moon fan
06-04-2019T18:14:40,Bgrmystr2,and end up being amazing and worth the time
06-04-2019T18:14:43,RimaDraws,always have been
06-04-2019T18:14:45,Eternity1,No Game No Life
06-04-2019T18:14:52,Bgrmystr2,but the first few episodes don't speak for the whole series.
06-04-2019T18:14:53,TorqueEmUp,Welcome to the NHK
06-04-2019T18:15:04,Mippy,I also am a Sailor Moon fan Rima
06-04-2019T18:15:05,NeonMitsumi,Nice to see something different and with a story behind it every now and then.
06-04-2019T18:15:11,RimaDraws,yes that one is good too torque
06-04-2019T18:15:17,RimaDraws,YES mippy
06-04-2019T18:15:23,SageSaga,unfortunately Sailor Moon isnt a good example of the type of anime someone likes
06-04-2019T18:15:28,FloofyCat,"Bgr, when there's not much under your belt, the first few episodes need to do it"
06-04-2019T18:15:33,Xexanoth,but if i don't enjoy the first few episodes i have no reasons to watch the later ones.
06-04-2019T18:15:34,SageSaga,because most people like it because they grew up with it
06-04-2019T18:15:36,Ordithus,"It really is, Neon"

06-04-2019T18:16:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Inu X Buku SS just about throws you under a bus with the first episode
06-04-2019T18:16:20,SageSaga,I think xXxHolic was better than Tsubasa Resevoir Chronicles
06-04-2019T18:16:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Then you meet the mask wearing sadist/masochist dude with a whip
06-04-2019T18:16:57,RimaDraws,i own xXxholic
06-04-2019T18:17:00,RimaDraws,i loved it

06-04-2019T18:17:23,SageSaga,ha- Mippy knows the xXx is silent
06-04-2019T18:17:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Make sure to lean into that back bend

06-04-2019T18:18:08,SageSaga,the xXx is a place holder for what the person is addicted to
06-04-2019T18:18:18,Mippy,@SageSaga of course. I went through a big CLAMP phase in high school
06-04-2019T18:18:23,Xexanoth,"oh shit, i just realized the second one punch man season comes uut this week."
06-04-2019T18:18:24,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s a reverse downward dog
06-04-2019T18:18:48,Xexanoth,*out
06-04-2019T18:18:50,SageSaga,really worried about season 2 of OPM

06-04-2019T18:19:12,SageSaga,One Punch Man
06-04-2019T18:19:13,Mippy,One punch man
06-04-2019T18:19:14,Ordithus,I hope it is good
06-04-2019T18:19:16,Xexanoth,i'm just gonna be happy people are not gonna be bitching about 5 year old manga spoilers anymore once it's out
06-04-2019T18:19:20,Ordithus,The first was great
06-04-2019T18:19:23,BadFoMo,Thank you.
06-04-2019T18:19:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Hopefully he doesn’t actually try that. Hate for him to get stuck
06-04-2019T18:19:44,FloofyCat,To avoid saying Fullmetal Attack on Hunter X Cowboy JoJo Piece I'm gunna say Hajime no Ippo since that's definitely something underrated.
06-04-2019T18:19:48,SageSaga,New studio is behind season 2
06-04-2019T18:19:51,Alphawolf333,"Yeah, cautious optimism. But so far not looking good"
06-04-2019T18:19:58,SageSaga,Ippo is awesome
06-04-2019T18:20:01,TorqueEmUp,Yeah like me some JoJo as well

06-04-2019T18:20:13,Alphawolf333,K
06-04-2019T18:20:16,RimaDraws,i am considering watching jojo
06-04-2019T18:20:19,FloofyCat,Hajime no Ippo
06-04-2019T18:20:25,SageSaga,it was called FIGHTING SPIRIT! in the US :P
06-04-2019T18:20:28,MarvTheHugPharaoh,watch jojo
06-04-2019T18:20:29,BadFoMo,What is that?
06-04-2019T18:20:31,Eternity1,No Game No Life anyone?
06-04-2019T18:20:34,SageSaga,Boxing anime
06-04-2019T18:20:36,SageSaga,super hype

06-04-2019T18:20:44,Mippy,Should finish watching JoJo
06-04-2019T18:20:49,FloofyCat,Yeah don't be put off by the sports anime genre though
06-04-2019T18:20:51,WereKeidran,"whew, almost missed poll"
06-04-2019T18:21:06,FloofyCat,It's got more character development than most anime by far
06-04-2019T18:21:07,Xexanoth,"also Sewayaki Kitsune no Senko-san aka ""Touch Fluffy Tail"" is gonna get a anime....which is kinda weird"
06-04-2019T18:21:19,FloofyCat,It's also got humour
06-04-2019T18:21:19,SageSaga,Jojo is crazy and i love every minute of it - unless people are drinking Tea
06-04-2019T18:21:26,SageSaga,only Jojo fans will get that
06-04-2019T18:21:37,Ordithus,I don't get it.  I don't watch jojo
06-04-2019T18:21:43,SageSaga,see?
06-04-2019T18:21:47,BadFoMo,What's a Kigurumi?
06-04-2019T18:21:52,Ordithus,I guess I don't?
06-04-2019T18:21:59,Mippy,I don’t think I’ve seen enough of JoJo to get it yet
06-04-2019T18:22:02,Alphawolf333,basically a onesie I think
06-04-2019T18:22:11,BadFoMo,...Ok.
06-04-2019T18:22:28,FloofyCat,Hajime no Ippo is 100% a must watch for anyone who wants a break from superhero powers n' stuff in their anime and wants wholesome uplifting awesomeness.
06-04-2019T18:22:52,Xexanoth,not like there's tons of animes that aren't about superpowers...
06-04-2019T18:23:00,SageSaga,dempsey roll was super hype in Ippo

06-04-2019T18:26:53,Dadrobit,That was an arc in OOTS forever ago.
06-04-2019T18:27:07,FloofyCat,"Ord, wasn't Kat's life mostly sheltered? Well, relatively sheltered."
06-04-2019T18:27:07,BadFoMo,OOTS?
06-04-2019T18:27:09,Dadrobit,It ended poorly.
06-04-2019T18:27:15,Dadrobit,Or at least sadly.
06-04-2019T18:27:19,Ordithus,"Very, Floofy"
06-04-2019T18:27:31,Dadrobit,Order of the Stick. Fantastic DnD parody comic.

06-04-2019T18:27:40,BadFoMo,Thank you.
06-04-2019T18:27:42,FloofyCat,"Come to think of it I can't think on Flora's slave years being expanded upon that much at all, although it probably has and it's just my memory."
06-04-2019T18:28:03,Ordithus,It was talked about early in the comic.  Just brought up again in the oasis room
06-04-2019T18:28:10,Dadrobit,"Around 1100 pages, been reading it longer even than TwoKinds."

06-04-2019T18:33:27,Human72,this guy
06-04-2019T18:33:27,FloofyCat,"I think I found the comic after the 10th anniversary when everyone was in the ship, so for me it feels like everyone did everything prior really fast and everyone had been on the ship for ages."

06-04-2019T18:33:37,Human72,it is meh from DA etc

06-04-2019T19:37:21,Bgrmystr2,better than having no concentration at all.

06-04-2019T19:38:44,unsteddyphoenix,(CON actually stands for constituion)

06-04-2019T19:39:09,BadFoMo,Constituion?
06-04-2019T19:39:20,Ordithus,Concentration is a CON save
06-04-2019T19:39:23,Ordithus,Silly
06-04-2019T19:39:26,MuonNeutrino,because the constitution attribute in d&d is used for concentration checks
06-04-2019T19:39:26,unsteddyphoenix,"'cause when you get hit while maintaining a spell, you have to make a con save"
