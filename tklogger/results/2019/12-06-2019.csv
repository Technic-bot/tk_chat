12-06-2019T13:09:35,AspiringNoodle,Eric:  His head was in the gutter before gutters were even a thing.
12-06-2019T13:59:55,Bgrmystr2,I mean.. yes Kiwi that's the thing guys would do if that happened to them.
12-06-2019T14:00:06,Bgrmystr2,As is if it were the opposite.
12-06-2019T14:00:14,Bgrmystr2,"Not for everyone, but for a large majority."
12-06-2019T14:20:14,AspiringNoodle,*Watches anime*
12-06-2019T14:20:21,AspiringNoodle,*Character goes full edgelord*
12-06-2019T14:20:26,AspiringNoodle,*Cringing intensifies...*
12-06-2019T14:22:59,TerraTheWizard,someone's gotta do it
12-06-2019T14:25:00,Bgrmystr2,"hey, if they didn't do it, someone else would."
12-06-2019T14:27:48,AspiringNoodle,"I think what makes it worse is that the character has a kind of split personality.  And the trigger is utterly ridiculous, but then they animate the scene to play everything up."
12-06-2019T14:28:45,AspiringNoodle,I'm just waiting for that one character to call it out xD
12-06-2019T16:37:30,SpazztasticKiwi,not sure if this dog is just following this lady or if it’s hers
12-06-2019T16:41:00,SpazztasticKiwi,better question: why is there a husky in the south
12-06-2019T16:46:59,tehbear,because huskys are cool dogs.
12-06-2019T16:47:32,tehbear,but i wouldnt get one if i lived somewhere that was always warm-hot
12-06-2019T16:52:57,AspiringNoodle,The opposite end of that would be don't bring a samoyed to a winter wonderland.  You may just lose them :ptv-laugh:
12-06-2019T17:39:59,Xexanoth,"eh, just follow the trail of hairs..."

12-06-2019T18:24:51,SpazztasticKiwi,drink in one hand phone in the other and guess which one I pulled to my mouth
12-06-2019T18:53:37,TeapotOfDoom,Well I just flooded my desk and nearly my pc so yeah
12-06-2019T18:54:06,TeapotOfDoom,I probably should go to bed now...
12-06-2019T19:23:20,Dadrobit,Looks like Nintendo just lost a sale.
12-06-2019T19:23:58,Dadrobit,I was considering buying a Switch at some point in the nearish future as the new Pokemon was loking okay-ish. But now it's a hard pass from me.
12-06-2019T19:25:11,Dadrobit,"Just found out that the new games are hard limited on the Pokemon allowed in the game. The National Dex is gone, so the only Pokemon alowed in the game are the ones specifically for that region."
12-06-2019T19:25:43,Dadrobit,"Which is turbo-bullshit for a series founded on ""gotta catch 'em all!"""
12-06-2019T19:26:56,SpazztasticKiwi,yeah that’s something you get info on if you’re trying to get Pokémon go info
12-06-2019T19:27:28,SpazztasticKiwi,ends up sending you to a switch guide link on the pokemon
12-06-2019T19:28:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"speaking of which, today I caught some ice pokemon in 80-90ish weather"
12-06-2019T19:30:38,Dadrobit,I was already on the fence for the new games since I wasn't particularly a fan of Sun and Moon. I was really only interested because of the potential of getting the sword dog Legendary and naming it Sif like the unimaginative bastard I am.
12-06-2019T20:10:54,SpazztasticKiwi,if you want to see unimaginative check twitter challenges
12-06-2019T20:58:52,metalman20,how's everyone doing tonight?
12-06-2019T21:12:18,AspiringNoodle,"Good.  All the youtube vids FINALLY died down.  Computex + E3 back-to-back, jfc."
12-06-2019T21:13:57,metalman20,sweet sounds like you had fun man
12-06-2019T22:34:53,CrRAR,"oooo, a nimble nibbly leaps 'ndlessly"

12-06-2019T22:42:43,SpazztasticKiwi,"Dadro, you know much about paint"
12-06-2019T22:43:20,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-natsducky:
12-06-2019T22:49:03,AspiringNoodle,Microsoft Paint? Clip Studio Paint? Actual paint?
12-06-2019T22:59:37,CrRAR,"lol, just based off that statement Spazz I'm now imagining Dadrobit is like the Hank Hill of the paint world."
12-06-2019T23:00:07,CrRAR,"""I sell paint and paint ACCESSORIES."""
12-06-2019T23:00:27,Ordithus,See the pigment and not the brush
12-06-2019T23:00:45,Ordithus,That... doesn't work quite as well
12-06-2019T23:01:14,CrRAR,Hahaaa
12-06-2019T23:03:28,SpazztasticKiwi,no
12-06-2019T23:03:31,SpazztasticKiwi,just
12-06-2019T23:03:56,SpazztasticKiwi,what tf kind of color is “driftwood”
12-06-2019T23:06:07,metalman20,wait driftwood is actually a color..............where the hell have i been
12-06-2019T23:50:04,SpazztasticKiwi,they’re experimenting with a gel birth control for men and the first bloody comment is “hold on I gotta put on my son block”
