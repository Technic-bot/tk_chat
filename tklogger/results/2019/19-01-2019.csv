19-01-2019T00:49:38,TheBeckoner,did you fed him?
19-01-2019T00:49:42,TheBeckoner,feed*
19-01-2019T00:53:56,SpazztasticKiwi,He got some
19-01-2019T00:59:57,TheBeckoner,hmm thats a bizarre way to say that
19-01-2019T01:00:06,TheBeckoner,but good the cat will not wither
19-01-2019T01:28:51,RimaDraws,yea cats always act like they are starved
19-01-2019T01:28:55,RimaDraws,dont let them fool you
19-01-2019T01:29:10,RimaDraws,ive got two who do the same thing
19-01-2019T01:30:04,SpazztasticKiwi,He likes to tap at me with his wee foot if he thinks I can’t see he’s quietly asking for a bite
19-01-2019T01:30:28,RimaDraws,i dont  let my cats eat people food
19-01-2019T01:30:37,RimaDraws,i made that mistake with my dog
19-01-2019T01:31:32,SpazztasticKiwi,I watch his diet. He only got some bites of ham. It’s just a regular cooked ham
19-01-2019T01:33:22,RimaDraws,ham is bad for dogs in big pieces idk how it is for cats
19-01-2019T01:33:47,RimaDraws,my cats hardly eat turkey or chicken which is unusual.
19-01-2019T01:39:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Kiwi won’t eat wet food
19-01-2019T01:39:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Or raw meat
19-01-2019T01:59:49,RimaDraws,i feed them wet food but rarely. not good for their bellies
19-01-2019T03:47:43,TorqueEmUp,"My ex's mom's cat had nearly died from bad cat food once, took him a long time to recover from it, and could only eat wet cat food from that point."

19-01-2019T11:06:44,CrimsonQuill,Rushing in head first is not a good survival strategy.

19-01-2019T11:09:29,CrimsonQuill,I've watched some fails of the week episodes that sum up the worst that can happen in Halo.

19-01-2019T13:18:06,Dadrobit,Finally got my submission in. Seriously considered not even bothering tbh. Feels like the color sketches are all but a foregone conclusion this month.
19-01-2019T13:18:18,Dadrobit,So. Much. Fanservice.
19-01-2019T13:20:54,CrimsonQuill,"Dadrobit, you have my vote."
19-01-2019T13:21:16,CrimsonQuill,I hope that Bookclub makes it in.

19-01-2019T13:26:19,RimaDraws,ive never won a vote so far only tom picks
19-01-2019T13:26:19,CrimsonQuill,"Which was yours, Rima?"
19-01-2019T13:26:38,RimaDraws,mine is raine and roselyn enjoying family bonding time together at a festival

19-01-2019T13:27:54,CrimsonQuill,And I do tend to obsess over one piece.

19-01-2019T13:28:08,RimaDraws,i cant give up
19-01-2019T13:28:13,Dadrobit,"Eh, I'm not concerned at the ineviability of bookclub getting sketched or not, I'm more concerned that it doesn's stand a snowball's chance in hell of being colored next to the rest of the colors this month lol."

19-01-2019T16:26:21,Mippy,Tom do his pick first ?
19-01-2019T16:26:22,Yosshq,bye
19-01-2019T16:26:23,Bgrmystr2,tom picked while we were voting yeah
19-01-2019T16:26:34,RimaDraws,well it could be for round seven because he usually does one for it since theres no tom pick on it
19-01-2019T16:26:44,LannAF,A pick
19-01-2019T16:26:46,LannAF,Shaped like tom
19-01-2019T16:26:48,Bgrmystr2,naw this will be considered round 1
19-01-2019T16:26:49,ThingsAreMoving,That would mean... 8 sketches?
19-01-2019T16:26:56,LannAF,textured like Tom?
19-01-2019T16:26:59,Yosshq,:'l

19-01-2019T16:27:13,RimaDraws,no its natani
19-01-2019T16:27:19,Bgrmystr2,"there's 7 sketches usually, not 8"
19-01-2019T16:27:22,ThingsAreMoving,^
19-01-2019T16:27:24,LannAF,For some reason Tom pick just made me think of a Tom skin for a pickaxe.
19-01-2019T16:27:24,RimaDraws,male and female one
19-01-2019T16:27:26,Mippy,There is a secret 8th day you can only access after you get all three stars
19-01-2019T16:27:31,LannAF,I was wondering how that would work
19-01-2019T16:27:36,ThingsAreMoving,"Lann, that's not creepy at all"
19-01-2019T16:27:38,RimaDraws,ok just saying sorry
19-01-2019T16:27:49,Xexanoth,probably lots of ornage and then a sticker with toms face on it @Lann
19-01-2019T16:27:56,LannAF,More than likely it'd be like one of those horrifying face textures when you try to look at origin files for characters
19-01-2019T16:28:00,LannAF,just pasted all over the pick
19-01-2019T16:28:01,LannAF,oh.
19-01-2019T16:28:05,LannAF,That actually makes sense.

19-01-2019T18:36:29,Bgrmystr2,that is a good point
19-01-2019T18:36:35,Bgrmystr2,but now tom's changing everything

19-01-2019T20:45:05,Twokinds,"Well, because it's also slowly taking her over. And every time she uses her ability, it leaves the cat to take her body for a joyride."
19-01-2019T20:45:10,BadFoMo,Based on the new movie by Ove Bol!
19-01-2019T20:45:26,IronHorseComics,did she ever consider tying the body down somewhere?
19-01-2019T20:45:28,unsteddyphoenix,Ok I guess there are ups and downs

19-01-2019T20:46:01,CrimsonQuill,That sounds like a whole lot of trouble in the house...it would make a rip-roaring read.
19-01-2019T20:46:04,unsteddyphoenix,Would the cat have been malicious? Or just a Nora-esque trickster sort?
19-01-2019T20:46:21,PaperLungs,oof
19-01-2019T20:46:24,Eternity1,we need a story like tht

19-01-2019T22:02:12,FenceEqualizer,"Nah, it's kinda long."
19-01-2019T22:02:19,AFallingTree,its better than 3
19-01-2019T22:02:23,Ordithus,For what?
19-01-2019T22:02:27,FenceEqualizer,Though it fives people more of a chance so who am I too complain
19-01-2019T22:02:27,Xexanoth,voting
19-01-2019T22:02:27,AFallingTree,polls
19-01-2019T22:02:30,Ordithus,Oh
19-01-2019T22:02:31,BadFoMo,The voting.
19-01-2019T22:02:37,Ordithus,It's more than long enough
19-01-2019T22:02:38,Bgrmystr2,"it was never 3 though, not that I recall"
19-01-2019T22:02:40,FenceEqualizer,"Gives, not fives"
19-01-2019T22:02:40,MarshallMelon,I could've sworn it used to be 5
19-01-2019T22:02:44,Bgrmystr2,it was 5
19-01-2019T22:02:46,Bgrmystr2,not 3
19-01-2019T22:02:52,MarshallMelon,That'd be why then!
19-01-2019T22:02:53,AFallingTree,oh srry'
19-01-2019T22:02:57,unsteddyphoenix,Meh its fine
19-01-2019T22:02:57,Bgrmystr2,"and it's been 5 for as long as I can recall, all the way back to the beginnig"
19-01-2019T22:03:03,Bgrmystr2,which was plenty of time imo
19-01-2019T22:03:04,AFallingTree,yeah 5 would be fine
19-01-2019T22:03:10,Ordithus,At the beginning it was a poll on picarto itself
19-01-2019T22:03:19,BadFoMo,Maybe 6 minutes? 5 or 6.
19-01-2019T22:03:21,MarshallMelon,Didn't it used to be three back when we were using the inbuilt polling system?
19-01-2019T22:03:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,the olden days
19-01-2019T22:03:33,Ordithus,I don't think it had a time limit
19-01-2019T22:03:47,Bgrmystr2,"yeah it was picarto originally, I recall, and then Amenon made the poll site"
19-01-2019T22:03:51,Ordithus,Tom stopped it when things seemed settled
19-01-2019T22:03:51,MarvTheHugPharaoh,no time limit
19-01-2019T22:03:56,AFallingTree,it would be good if the first poll is 10 minutes to alow ppl to join the stream and vote then 5 mins for the rest of them
19-01-2019T22:04:04,AFallingTree,*allow
19-01-2019T22:04:08,FenceEqualizer,"We where their when it was five, the newer generations will never know."
19-01-2019T22:04:18,Bgrmystr2,xD
19-01-2019T22:04:22,MarshallMelon,TKPolls always unnerved me. Security's too lax. Seems easy to fool.
19-01-2019T22:04:37,BadFoMo,How so?
19-01-2019T22:04:37,Ordithus,"But, that would require effort"
19-01-2019T22:04:46,AFallingTree,^
19-01-2019T22:04:51,AFallingTree,who has time for that
19-01-2019T22:04:52,MarvTheHugPharaoh,no one got the gumption for tha
19-01-2019T22:04:54,MarshallMelon,It can't tell you're the same person if you open a private window
19-01-2019T22:05:14,InTheLionsDen,It uses the honor system and we are all honorable here.
19-01-2019T22:05:22,AFallingTree,tru
19-01-2019T22:05:23,BadFoMo,Private window?
19-01-2019T22:05:36,unsteddyphoenix,"I dont see any evidence of rigging though, really"
19-01-2019T22:05:37,BadFoMo,@InTheLionsDen We are?
19-01-2019T22:05:42,MarshallMelon,"Y'know, when browsers stop tracking you"
19-01-2019T22:05:49,unsteddyphoenix,"At least, not consistantly."
19-01-2019T22:05:50,Xexanoth,aka incognito
19-01-2019T22:05:59,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"If it had been rig'd, I would have won"
19-01-2019T22:06:03,TorqueEmUp,Bunny village part 2 *Please suggest it.*
19-01-2019T22:06:07,BadFoMo,I've never heard of that.
19-01-2019T22:06:12,AFallingTree,so what if you get 1 extra vote
19-01-2019T22:06:24,Xexanoth,you can open a lot of private tabs
19-01-2019T22:06:28,Xexanoth,cue lots of votes
19-01-2019T22:06:32,MarshallMelon,No see that's the point. It can't tell EVERY TIME you open a new window
19-01-2019T22:06:32,AFallingTree,i dont know anyone who acctully dose that
19-01-2019T22:06:40,MarshallMelon,It's theoretically infinite votes
19-01-2019T22:06:49,Xexanoth,To infinity and beyond
19-01-2019T22:06:52,BadFoMo,Hmm...
19-01-2019T22:06:57,RimaDraws,hmmmmmm
19-01-2019T22:07:07,Xexanoth,and i think we really shouldn't have mentioned that Melon
19-01-2019T22:07:07,MarshallMelon,Picarto at least had failsafes to stop that from happening
19-01-2019T22:07:15,FenceEqualizer,And from this day forth the ballets got super rigged
19-01-2019T22:07:19,Xexanoth,aye
19-01-2019T22:07:20,Alphawolf333,Though most of the time the difference between ideas isn't usually too big
19-01-2019T22:07:22,MarshallMelon,"Eh, nobody checks the afterparty anyway"
19-01-2019T22:07:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,also takes a long time to set up
19-01-2019T22:07:30,AFallingTree,its very rare for trolls to do that
19-01-2019T22:07:38,Bgrmystr2,"the votes afterwards, marshall? I do."
19-01-2019T22:07:43,Bgrmystr2,here and there.
19-01-2019T22:07:52,Eternity1,I know how to fool a google forms vote
19-01-2019T22:07:54,MarshallMelon,"Nah, I mean this part of the chat right now"
19-01-2019T22:08:00,Xexanoth,depending on the browser you can literally just copy tabs
19-01-2019T22:08:04,Bgrmystr2,"oh, there's a few of us that live here"
19-01-2019T22:08:09,Bgrmystr2,myself included
19-01-2019T22:08:13,MarshallMelon,"True, but we're all decent citizens"
19-01-2019T22:08:14,Xexanoth,so it takes you about 10 seconds to open alot
19-01-2019T22:08:19,MarshallMelon,I think
19-01-2019T22:08:20,FenceEqualizer,Some shadiness
19-01-2019T22:08:25,qwe304,@MarshallMelon I couldve sworn it did basic ip checking
19-01-2019T22:08:26,BadFoMo,We are?
19-01-2019T22:08:33,Eternity1,It does
19-01-2019T22:08:43,Bgrmystr2,"It does yes, qwe"
19-01-2019T22:08:46,Xexanoth,"private disables basic ip checking, that's the problem"
19-01-2019T22:08:50,MarshallMelon,"I messed around with it when it first came out, qwe. It'll log more than one vote"
19-01-2019T22:08:58,qwe304,oof
19-01-2019T22:09:03,MarshallMelon,Breaking things is kind of a hobby for me
19-01-2019T22:09:04,Bgrmystr2,but it still has to come from an external IP to reach the website
19-01-2019T22:09:12,qwe304,welp I wonder how long people have been abusing that for
19-01-2019T22:09:25,qwe304,I always felt like unpopular things won a lot
19-01-2019T22:09:30,Xexanoth,doubtfull anyone really abused it
19-01-2019T22:09:39,MarshallMelon,"Silent majority in play, mostly"
19-01-2019T22:09:44,Xexanoth,there's always been less voters in poll than watchers
19-01-2019T22:09:46,unsteddyphoenix,yeah
19-01-2019T22:09:52,qwe304,is there anyone that has been selected an unusual number of times?
19-01-2019T22:09:55,FenceEqualizer,Really? Usually the popular stuff wins a lot
19-01-2019T22:10:00,Xexanoth,^
19-01-2019T22:10:01,Xexanoth,also that
19-01-2019T22:10:04,MarshallMelon,Can't think of any major examples
19-01-2019T22:10:05,FenceEqualizer,Like the WWII flavor of the month
19-01-2019T22:10:14,MarshallMelon,"That's just a trend, I think"
19-01-2019T22:10:24,Xexanoth,"also keep in mind that people just have different tastes, so ""unpopular"" really doesn't work"
19-01-2019T22:10:24,Bgrmystr2,"overall, I'm not recalling anything out of the ordinary"
19-01-2019T22:10:24,qwe304,"yes, but the strange fringe stuff that a lot of people dont like wins surprisingly often"
19-01-2019T22:10:32,Bgrmystr2,trends happen
19-01-2019T22:10:41,Bgrmystr2,it's mostly the vocal minority that don't like it
19-01-2019T22:10:43,FenceEqualizer,What I mean nothing really stands out
19-01-2019T22:10:43,Bgrmystr2,not the majority
19-01-2019T22:10:53,FenceEqualizer,You can kinda tell whats going to be voted for
19-01-2019T22:10:58,MarshallMelon,"If a suggestion is A: Fetish-y or B: Contains the ""Meta"" characters it stands a much greater chance of winning the vote"
19-01-2019T22:11:14,Xexanoth,"everytime i look in chat during votes, there's many people voting for different stuff and afterwards people complain about that thing X won, while others go ""i voted that"""
19-01-2019T22:11:35,qwe304,theres some ways to abuse basic human psycology to garner more votes
19-01-2019T22:11:35,MarshallMelon,Also worth noting that the TKPolls system uses AV
19-01-2019T22:11:38,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, amenon could always demand an IP from the address for the vote or it won't allow you to vote"
19-01-2019T22:11:50,FenceEqualizer,Reni in a one piece
19-01-2019T22:11:53,Bgrmystr2,but I highly doubt anything would change
19-01-2019T22:11:59,Bgrmystr2,you could email him about it
19-01-2019T22:12:02,MarshallMelon,"So if a seemingly unpopular one gets second place in people's rosters, it wins anyway"
19-01-2019T22:12:12,MarshallMelon,That might be why
19-01-2019T22:12:29,qwe304,I havent voted at all in months
19-01-2019T22:12:40,AFallingTree,well all we can do is keep an eye out for suspicious activity
19-01-2019T22:12:44,MarshallMelon,Same. Tom Picks tend to be more interesting
19-01-2019T22:13:02,qwe304,because fanscervice wins
19-01-2019T22:13:09,InTheLionsDen,^
19-01-2019T22:13:15,Bgrmystr2,not sure what you expect from this community
19-01-2019T22:13:16,qwe304,petition to delete tkpolls
19-01-2019T22:13:24,qwe304,majourity descision is wrong
19-01-2019T22:13:28,unsteddyphoenix,yeah all that bunny fanservice
19-01-2019T22:13:35,unsteddyphoenix,wew laddie
19-01-2019T22:13:36,qwe304,this should be an aristocracy
19-01-2019T22:13:39,InTheLionsDen,What would you replace it with?
19-01-2019T22:13:43,MarshallMelon,Personally I liked the prototype system where it was completely random
19-01-2019T22:13:46,Alphawolf333,Yeah lets vote on taking down voting!
19-01-2019T22:13:51,MarshallMelon,Picarto already has support for it
19-01-2019T22:14:00,unsteddyphoenix,We'll just ignore that all the pinups lost this week
19-01-2019T22:14:15,FenceEqualizer,Barely
19-01-2019T22:14:17,qwe304,"well, about how many viewers were there on the stream?"
19-01-2019T22:14:19,BadFoMo,I say we let Tom pick them all from now on.
19-01-2019T22:14:35,MarshallMelon,"Didn't count the stream numbers, but voters averaged around 140"
19-01-2019T22:14:41,RimaDraws,its tom's decision how he runs the streams
19-01-2019T22:14:46,RimaDraws,not anyone elses
19-01-2019T22:14:58,FenceEqualizer,Though no biggy and mostly joking. I complain but in the end I don't really care just like seeing Tom draw.
19-01-2019T22:15:08,MarshallMelon,Hear hear
19-01-2019T22:15:12,Bgrmystr2,yeah same
19-01-2019T22:15:24,RimaDraws,he has the final say in things not us
19-01-2019T22:15:24,InTheLionsDen,Voting gives the illusion of engagement. They pay him money to be engaged.
19-01-2019T22:15:34,qwe304,117 voters on the last poll
19-01-2019T22:15:44,qwe304,that seems a bit high imo
19-01-2019T22:16:00,unsteddyphoenix,"Average viewer count is, what, 200?"
19-01-2019T22:16:10,FenceEqualizer,Is it really an illusion when we actually vote and throw ideas out?
19-01-2019T22:16:11,qwe304,less than that
19-01-2019T22:16:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,was 207 earlier today
19-01-2019T22:16:14,Bgrmystr2,between 170 and 250...? i'd say?
19-01-2019T22:16:19,Bgrmystr2,for average viewer
19-01-2019T22:16:19,Xexanoth,last week the last poll had 125
19-01-2019T22:16:31,FenceEqualizer,Could have sworn it was 200
19-01-2019T22:16:32,unsteddyphoenix,117/200-ish?
19-01-2019T22:16:35,MarshallMelon,I think the second to last poll this time logged somewhere around 130
19-01-2019T22:16:38,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah those numbers just dont work /s
19-01-2019T22:16:50,BadFoMo,"Ok what if we keep the 10 minute timer, but the polls are updated to have ALL requests in one poll?"
19-01-2019T22:16:58,TorqueEmUp,"Yeah, voting creates engagement. That's why they are during the stream, but decided before."
19-01-2019T22:17:00,qwe304,im not saying its physically impossible
19-01-2019T22:17:02,FenceEqualizer,Though I am certain there's a number of people who don't log on
19-01-2019T22:17:06,qwe304,just seems strange
19-01-2019T22:17:08,TorqueEmUp,Not Decided before*
19-01-2019T22:17:13,MarshallMelon,Actually that could work. One voting segment could cut down on stream time
19-01-2019T22:17:34,unsteddyphoenix,What I would actually like
19-01-2019T22:17:37,RimaDraws,put him on ignore. sorry just tired of the complaining. votes happen for a reason and its not our choice what is said
19-01-2019T22:17:46,InTheLionsDen,People that can't make the start of the stream would complain.
19-01-2019T22:17:52,unsteddyphoenix,Is if Tom put a bit of order in each poll
19-01-2019T22:17:52,qwe304,:thinking:
19-01-2019T22:17:54,MarshallMelon,Who's complaining? We're just shooting the shit
19-01-2019T22:18:02,RimaDraws,im talking about qwe
19-01-2019T22:18:05,MarshallMelon,Ah
19-01-2019T22:18:07,AFallingTree,i often close the stream but keep the polls and chat open to speed up bandwith
19-01-2019T22:18:08,unsteddyphoenix,"So perhaps the ""lewd"" ones could be in their own poll"
19-01-2019T22:18:14,Xexanoth,polls seem pretty consisten between 100-130 so
19-01-2019T22:18:15,AFallingTree,*bandwidth
19-01-2019T22:18:22,unsteddyphoenix,Keith and Nat could have their own poll too
19-01-2019T22:18:31,MarshallMelon,Now THAT'd be an improvement
19-01-2019T22:18:38,MarshallMelon,Outta here with that KANDAT junk
19-01-2019T22:18:41,Xexanoth,just draw every suggestion /s
19-01-2019T22:18:42,unsteddyphoenix,"Though its a lot of extra work for Tom, unless he gets someone to do it for him"
19-01-2019T22:18:44,RimaDraws,if he did that then it would make things more complicated
19-01-2019T22:18:51,Bgrmystr2,"lol, marshall with the salt :v"
19-01-2019T22:18:54,FenceEqualizer,Lol the Keith Natani polls
19-01-2019T22:18:58,RimaDraws,he would need someone to help him run the polls
19-01-2019T22:19:02,Xexanoth,we didn't even get Kandat this week but people still complain
19-01-2019T22:19:02,unsteddyphoenix,Keithtani wars~
19-01-2019T22:19:12,MarshallMelon,It's mostly a meme at this point
19-01-2019T22:19:28,Bgrmystr2,"which is sad, cuz it's just as bad."
19-01-2019T22:19:29,TorqueEmUp,Also no Kat this week
19-01-2019T22:19:36,unsteddyphoenix,I know~ :(
19-01-2019T22:19:39,MarshallMelon,Personally I'm not too invested in the votes anymore
19-01-2019T22:19:49,MarshallMelon,First time I've been to a stream in months
19-01-2019T22:19:53,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Teddy, wanta make a deal?"
19-01-2019T22:20:06,Twokinds,There really wasn't that many Kat suggestions
19-01-2019T22:20:08,unsteddyphoenix,Whats that marv
19-01-2019T22:20:17,TorqueEmUp,"Yeah, surprising actually"
19-01-2019T22:20:17,RimaDraws,i didnt see many kat ones tbh
19-01-2019T22:20:21,RimaDraws,i expected some
19-01-2019T22:20:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I'll make a adorable Kat if you sketch out Ember
19-01-2019T22:20:29,unsteddyphoenix,I know~ my Kat supporters have left me
19-01-2019T22:20:29,MarvTheHugPharaoh,kat suggestion
19-01-2019T22:20:35,unsteddyphoenix,Its just me and that other Tom
19-01-2019T22:20:37,BadFoMo,All the votes in one poll would also kill the chance of the 'Cool Ones' being in their own polls with a lot of 'Crap Ones'.
19-01-2019T22:20:38,unsteddyphoenix,Oooooo
19-01-2019T22:20:45,TorqueEmUp,Maybe people are getting a little tired of them
19-01-2019T22:20:48,unsteddyphoenix,Ok im down i'll try
19-01-2019T22:20:55,MarvTheHugPharaoh,My man <3
19-01-2019T22:20:56,BadFoMo,"Also, a little late, I know."
19-01-2019T22:21:02,unsteddyphoenix,Torque nice joke lol
19-01-2019T22:21:22,RimaDraws,still the whole thing on what gets its own poll is alot of work. and that takes a bit to run
19-01-2019T22:21:30,FenceEqualizer,Just getting a breather the Kat suggestion shall return
19-01-2019T22:21:45,unsteddyphoenix,Kat reqs do seem to come in bursts
19-01-2019T22:21:58,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Teddy how about ""Kat babysitting Maeve, both cuddled up on the couch fast asleep."""
19-01-2019T22:22:01,InTheLionsDen,:ctwokinds-katwet:
19-01-2019T22:22:10,MarshallMelon,Could've sworn we had something like that before
19-01-2019T22:22:12,Bgrmystr2,"lol you say ""crap ones"" like there's actually anything in the votes as such."
19-01-2019T22:22:13,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah it was just ""in an ideal world"" idea Rima. I dont expect Tom to actually do it."
19-01-2019T22:22:18,TorqueEmUp,Might have some Keirdran Nibbly popularity with MM.
19-01-2019T22:22:25,TorqueEmUp,Which I am ok with. :3
19-01-2019T22:22:32,unsteddyphoenix,Sounds DAMN cute Marv im IN
19-01-2019T22:22:39,qwe304,@TorqueEmUp that will be next week
19-01-2019T22:22:47,qwe304,when the rest of the people see it
19-01-2019T22:22:52,MarvTheHugPharaoh,will send it next suggestion stream
19-01-2019T22:22:58,MarshallMelon,"Week after, you mean. Colour poll's next"
19-01-2019T22:22:58,FenceEqualizer,If it's not broke. Till then I shall keep with the comdiesh suggestions
19-01-2019T22:23:01,RimaDraws,it sounds okay at first really does but then again i would be going crazy if i ahd to do it
19-01-2019T22:23:03,RimaDraws,had
19-01-2019T22:23:04,RimaDraws,omg
19-01-2019T22:23:07,unsteddyphoenix,The pact is sealed
19-01-2019T22:23:18,BadFoMo,@Bgrmystr2 I used that term in lue of a better name for it.
19-01-2019T22:23:19,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:handshake:
19-01-2019T22:23:24,FenceEqualizer,Though damn it I hope I can get a wholesome suggestion to win vote someday
19-01-2019T22:23:35,BadFoMo,"@Bgrmystr2 One moment, please."
19-01-2019T22:23:40,unsteddyphoenix,Shrug i'd do it. Im interested to see how it'd work
19-01-2019T22:24:29,Bgrmystr2,xD mmmhmmm
19-01-2019T22:25:04,FenceEqualizer,Oh shoot think the blood moon is starting on my end
19-01-2019T22:25:11,Xexanoth,wouldn't the Kat and Maeve sketch be really similar to Maeve sleeping on adiras tail?
19-01-2019T22:25:37,RimaDraws,ima just have to continue my suggestion after color stream

19-01-2019T22:27:51,Bgrmystr2,it's not that much space.
19-01-2019T22:28:02,MarshallMelon,"True, but it's a ton of curation"
19-01-2019T22:28:03,qwe304,ive screencaped everything tom has shown on stream in the past 13 months

19-01-2019T22:28:58,Bgrmystr2,screenshotting stuff
19-01-2019T22:29:02,Bgrmystr2,and saving stuff from patreon
19-01-2019T22:29:04,BadFoMo,"@Bgrmystr2 If you want someone to pick something you like, but need to give them more choices, you add bad choices that they most likely wouldn't pick with the one you want them to pick."

19-01-2019T22:32:02,qwe304,pretty sure nothing new
19-01-2019T22:32:05,Dadrobit,"Yeah, glasses. Looked rather prim, if even intimidating?"
19-01-2019T22:32:09,qwe304,aside from the sketches ofc
19-01-2019T22:32:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Yee same wolf
19-01-2019T22:32:18,MarshallMelon,All of it's several years old at the point
19-01-2019T22:32:21,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah longwolf, but there was others as well"
19-01-2019T22:32:23,MarshallMelon,*this

19-01-2019T22:32:33,unsteddyphoenix,So i'd giev the vod I look
19-01-2019T22:32:35,Dadrobit,The stilt wolf librarian was actually originally going to be a part of the book club.
19-01-2019T22:32:44,Bgrmystr2,yeah phoenix has been around for a while and he hadn't seen em
19-01-2019T22:32:49,qwe304,there were two old pieces shown

19-01-2019T22:33:49,MarshallMelon,Always found it kinda odd that this fandom has such a universal fixation with Ember
19-01-2019T22:33:59,MarshallMelon,Just seems so random
19-01-2019T22:34:05,Ordithus,I think that's just us
19-01-2019T22:34:14,unsteddyphoenix,^

19-01-2019T22:34:39,Dadrobit,"I figured asking for four characters would be pressing my luck. But yeah, originally the stilt wolf would be the book club president."
19-01-2019T22:34:42,unsteddyphoenix,w0lf was a fan before he hit the big leagues
19-01-2019T22:34:46,unsteddyphoenix,We gotta stick together
