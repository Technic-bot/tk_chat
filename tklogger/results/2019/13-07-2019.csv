13-07-2019T04:50:54,TerraTheWizard,brutus is adorable
13-07-2019T08:04:13,CrimsonQuill,Hello
13-07-2019T08:04:25,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-nibsbounce:
13-07-2019T08:05:38,CrimsonQuill,...Find some trousers...okee-dokee Reni.
13-07-2019T08:06:36,AspiringNoodle,Lol
13-07-2019T08:06:41,AspiringNoodle,Reni is absolutely adorable
13-07-2019T08:06:49,AspiringNoodle,But so is Brutus...
13-07-2019T08:06:56,AspiringNoodle,THERE'S TOO MUCH CUTE ON ONE PAGE!!!
13-07-2019T08:08:49,CrimsonQuill,...You guys do realise that he had a part in setting Edinmire on fire.
13-07-2019T08:09:11,CrimsonQuill,"I mean, even if he becomes an ally, we musn't forget his crimes."
13-07-2019T08:09:22,CrimsonQuill,And he has to earn trust...
13-07-2019T08:10:00,CrimsonQuill,"Perhaps, in time, he can be forgiven...but not forgotten."
13-07-2019T08:11:47,AspiringNoodle,"But... he's a big, fluffy dummy :ptv-whiny:"
13-07-2019T08:12:15,CrimsonQuill,Appearances can be deceptive
13-07-2019T08:15:44,CrimsonQuill,Trace looks adorable sometimes
13-07-2019T08:16:10,CrimsonQuill,Doesn't change the fact that he has an evil black smoke hallucination trying to bring him back to his genocidal ways.
13-07-2019T08:19:46,AspiringNoodle,Trace isn't floofy tho
13-07-2019T08:19:47,AspiringNoodle,:3
13-07-2019T08:25:15,Dadrobit,"Pfft, the community doesn't care in the slightest so long as the character has redeeming qualities. And by redeming qualities, I mean that they are drawn to be sexy."
13-07-2019T08:25:24,CrimsonQuill,...
13-07-2019T08:25:33,CrimsonQuill,blows a fuse.
13-07-2019T08:25:43,CrimsonQuill,requires fuse replacement
13-07-2019T08:25:51,CrimsonQuill,Hullo Dadrobit
13-07-2019T08:25:54,Dadrobit,yo
13-07-2019T08:26:25,AspiringNoodle,"On in this case that he's a big dummy with the body of Adonis, and so much floof that you could drown in it :p"
13-07-2019T08:26:46,AspiringNoodle,He probably gives the best hugs :ptv-hearts:
13-07-2019T08:27:14,CrimsonQuill,He'd better do something to atone his burning spree before I give him my trust...
13-07-2019T08:27:29,Dadrobit,My dude brutus has been getting fan art and community love literally since the day he got a face reveal immediately after burning the town.
13-07-2019T08:31:02,Dadrobit,"My money is less on him becoming a good boy from doing something redeeming, and more on him discovering how easily Clovis gave up on him."
13-07-2019T08:31:25,Dadrobit,Thus breaking that trust and changing sides.
13-07-2019T08:31:36,AspiringNoodle,...I'LL MURDER THAT BASTARD HALF-FOX :ptv-angry:
13-07-2019T08:32:36,Dadrobit,"Natani never really did anything whatsoever before joining the team, not even an apology. And Literally Hitler Trace only just barely started doing anything ""redeeming"" within the last week or so in-comic time."
13-07-2019T08:33:32,Dadrobit,"Brutus was never shown doing anything other than starting a couple fires, he's fine in the eyes of the majority of the community."
13-07-2019T08:56:59,CrimsonQuill,Huh...still needs to prove himself.
13-07-2019T08:57:13,CrimsonQuill,"I mean, I didn't trust Natani till chapter 10."
13-07-2019T08:57:43,CrimsonQuill,"And Zen...while he's at heart a decent person, I didn't trust HIM until the whole magic barrier incident."
13-07-2019T08:58:15,CrimsonQuill,"Weeeelll, maybe before then...early in that chapter..."
13-07-2019T08:58:30,CrimsonQuill,But floofyness and or cuteness should not mean letting the guard down.
13-07-2019T09:26:49,BadFoMo,Yo.
13-07-2019T09:26:57,CrimsonQuill,Hey BadFoMo

13-07-2019T11:27:39,Dadrobit,Only to find out it was a video dedicated to Minecraft meme. Closed it in the first two minutes.
13-07-2019T11:27:59,Dadrobit,But now every other video in my recommended is a friggin Minecraft video...
13-07-2019T11:28:47,IronHorseComics,go into your history and delete the video
13-07-2019T11:31:12,CrimsonQuill,I always open those videos in incognito before I watch them normally
13-07-2019T11:32:06,Dadrobit,"Yeah, actually went in and cleared everything forever right before I posted that. Fresh clean slate."

13-07-2019T12:32:57,CrimsonQuill,Because it's flipping hard.
13-07-2019T12:33:04,IronHorseComics,look at historical armor
13-07-2019T12:34:28,Twokinds,It's easy
13-07-2019T12:34:32,Twokinds,Just DRAW IT

13-07-2019T14:18:58,CrimsonQuill,My brother.
13-07-2019T14:19:07,CrimsonQuill,He thinks they're cute.
13-07-2019T14:19:11,CrimsonQuill,I think he's mad.
13-07-2019T14:19:41,Orthonox,Maybe he has learned enough about wasps to realize they may not be bad as people think.
13-07-2019T14:19:46,Orthonox,That is how I feel with spiders.
13-07-2019T14:20:04,IronHorseComics,"yah, spiders eat mosquitos"

13-07-2019T17:05:47,GiantBurger,"@CrimsonQuill  could try during the votes, could get a small feel for things"
13-07-2019T17:05:48,CrimsonQuill,Perhaps.
13-07-2019T17:05:53,AFallingTree,end of first sketch
13-07-2019T17:05:55,Taremong,I think he might've been doing so for a while...
13-07-2019T17:06:07,CrimsonQuill,"@GiantBurger nope, because I'm hoping my suggestion'll make it this time"
13-07-2019T17:06:09,CrimsonQuill,In the votes

13-07-2019T17:06:11,PalmettoPathfinder1,Maybe Clovis was in the closet before the curse too.
13-07-2019T17:06:12,Ordithus,He's a fluffy Napoleon
13-07-2019T17:06:14,AFallingTree,am
13-07-2019T17:06:25,GiantBurger,"Ahh, my suggestion lost to what’s being sketched now"
13-07-2019T17:06:27,BadFoMo,Is the stream not playing for anyone else?

13-07-2019T17:07:11,Avolendi,Evening :)
13-07-2019T17:07:15,TeapotOfDoom,Hi Avolendi
13-07-2019T17:07:20,GiantBurger,Yup
13-07-2019T17:07:21,AFallingTree,why are you watching a stream with a VPN on for?
13-07-2019T17:07:22,NezumiYuki,"Remember back when Clovis bitched at Brutus to put on a shirt and he replied, ""I would boss but, this spring heat is kinda intense, ya know?""    Oh yeah... Clovie knows!  xDDD"
13-07-2019T17:07:26,BadFoMo,Finally.
13-07-2019T17:08:07,AFallingTree,that's guaranteed to have problems
13-07-2019T17:08:22,Bgrmystr2,"lol Tree, you can VPN your entire internet line"
13-07-2019T17:08:31,TeapotOfDoom,yes
13-07-2019T17:08:31,Bgrmystr2,for anonymity
13-07-2019T17:08:32,AFallingTree,i cant
13-07-2019T17:08:37,TeapotOfDoom,and that's what i do generally
13-07-2019T17:08:38,BadFoMo,Why is Sythe's outfit reminding me of The Nutcracker?
13-07-2019T17:08:43,Mippy,There we go
13-07-2019T17:08:43,AFallingTree,wait really?
13-07-2019T17:08:49,TeapotOfDoom,yes
13-07-2019T17:08:52,CrimsonQuill,"Oh, Undertale!"
13-07-2019T17:08:56,Bgrmystr2,that's the whole idea of a VPN service lol
13-07-2019T17:09:01,TeapotOfDoom,but lately it's nothing but problems
13-07-2019T17:09:02,CrimsonQuill,This theme always hits me in the heart.
13-07-2019T17:09:06,NezumiYuki,"Same styling I think, Bad. That's probably why.  ^^"
13-07-2019T17:09:12,Bgrmystr2,"yeah if they have problems, so do you"

13-07-2019T17:09:29,TeapotOfDoom,pia has been so buggy lately
13-07-2019T17:09:29,AFallingTree,so people are using a VPN for their entire broadband line yet so many people are defeting the purpose by getting a voice assistant
13-07-2019T17:09:35,Taremong,Now I wanna see Sythe do the little dance.
13-07-2019T17:09:46,Bgrmystr2,lol tree prettymuch

13-07-2019T17:10:54,TeapotOfDoom,i'm even restricted to a subset of their servers on picarto because i'm autobanned with some of their ips
13-07-2019T17:10:58,CrRAR,"Not such a filthy beast now, is he Maren?"
13-07-2019T17:11:04,Bgrmystr2,"probably not with that specific connection, Tree"

13-07-2019T18:32:49,CrimsonQuill,"And no, I am not making that up"
13-07-2019T18:33:06,CrimsonQuill,There is a church in Venice named the Church of St Pantalon

13-07-2019T18:33:37,CrimsonQuill,And I will always call the trousers trousers.
13-07-2019T18:33:39,MoonDance,If skinny jeans feel uncomfortable- you're probably wearing the wrong size
13-07-2019T18:33:41,Mippy,Don’t they all in Italy?
13-07-2019T18:33:47,CrimsonQuill,Because that is what they are.

13-07-2019T18:34:41,CrimsonQuill,"Or just wait till the next poll, and if my suggestion is not vote, pray that it is a Tom pick, and sleep"
13-07-2019T18:34:46,Mippy,"Yes, Quill, but you shouldn’t take a “holier than thou” attitude when people use a different term than you do."

13-07-2019T18:35:17,Ordithus,Hm.  Dorito lore inbound.
13-07-2019T18:35:18,CrimsonQuill,I just like to tease about the grammar thing.
13-07-2019T18:35:39,IronHorseComics,turns out it's just an old dorito that's covered with mold
13-07-2019T18:35:39,CrRAR,Facial markings: What facial marking?
13-07-2019T18:35:58,CrimsonQuill,"(Although I admit I must sound rather patronizing, so my apologies for that.)"

13-07-2019T18:36:27,CrRAR,It's what's UNDER the dorito that's the REAL mystery here.

13-07-2019T18:36:33,Mippy,It’s hard to tell with you Quill. Sometimes I swear you have autism or something. Not that that’s a bad thing
13-07-2019T18:36:34,Ordithus,Nothing.
13-07-2019T18:36:38,Twokinds,It's the memory seal

13-07-2019T18:37:26,MoonDance,It seals him from going sicko mode
13-07-2019T18:37:29,CrimsonQuill,How come it's there before his fight with Ephemural?
13-07-2019T18:37:41,CrRAR,Just prod it gently
13-07-2019T18:38:05,Bgrmystr2,lol he had it before his memories were sealed though\
13-07-2019T18:38:07,Twokinds,Maybe he remembers it in the past because that's how he assumes he looked.

13-07-2019T20:31:10,DarthKeidran,@Orthonox a lot of places have comic cons or similar conventions.
13-07-2019T20:31:15,NezumiYuki,Tom you really need to put an edit on this one and put the glasses on Rose's fur pile!  xDDD

13-07-2019T20:32:53,Orthonox,I always thought that was a New York/San Diego thing. Did not know it was everywhere else. Too late anyway due to school.

13-07-2019T21:00:03,Ordithus,Cat news?
13-07-2019T21:04:26,Twokinds,Latest update: Cat's still fat
13-07-2019T21:07:39,FloofyCat,Huh?

13-07-2019T21:09:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheeras turning 3 in 14 days
13-07-2019T21:10:14,Ordithus,no longer a lil kitten
13-07-2019T21:10:54,SpazztasticKiwi,he may be getting a vet visit for a present. He’s got a boo boo on his neck
13-07-2019T21:11:49,qwe304,@Twokinds ive been working on coloring this sketch https://imgur.com/a/Pj7vmXY
13-07-2019T21:11:55,qwe304,what do you think?
13-07-2019T21:12:48,qwe304,im trying to replicate your style
13-07-2019T21:12:53,qwe304,but my lines feel off
13-07-2019T21:13:32,Twokinds,Nice work
13-07-2019T21:14:02,Bgrmystr2,the hair looks really good imo
13-07-2019T21:14:36,qwe304,any tips?
13-07-2019T21:14:56,Bgrmystr2,are we ignoring eric's hand? xD
13-07-2019T21:15:06,qwe304,yes
13-07-2019T21:15:11,qwe304,ignore all hands
13-07-2019T21:15:18,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-laugh: fair enough
13-07-2019T21:15:19,Ordithus,What about the feetsies?
13-07-2019T21:15:25,qwe304,soon
13-07-2019T21:15:29,qwe304,its not done
13-07-2019T21:15:41,SpazztasticKiwi,no feetsies
13-07-2019T21:15:42,Ordithus,Looks good so far.
13-07-2019T21:15:49,SpazztasticKiwi,tosies
13-07-2019T21:16:46,Bgrmystr2,the clothes and stuff are not bad either
13-07-2019T21:17:30,qwe304,keith's plateshirt was a pain
13-07-2019T21:17:39,qwe304,trying to replicate his normal armor
13-07-2019T21:18:45,Orthonox,Keith looks good. I find the eyes weird.
13-07-2019T21:18:57,qwe304,whos eyes?
13-07-2019T21:19:19,SpazztasticKiwi,"why’s Eric’s pose make me place him as the guy who’d go “3, 4...400, 401” when a girl walks by"
13-07-2019T21:19:29,Bgrmystr2,Trace's eyes have this weird 2nd eye effect thing going on..
13-07-2019T21:19:34,Bgrmystr2,and yeah haha kiwi for sure
13-07-2019T21:20:14,qwe304,@Bgrmystr2 thats just because i have the original sketch as a layer at like 50% opacity
13-07-2019T21:20:14,Orthonox,Eric and especially Trace. Keith is good though.
13-07-2019T21:20:26,Ordithus,"Ah, that makes more sense"
13-07-2019T21:20:59,SpazztasticKiwi,saw a cringe video where a guy filmed himself walking up to girls and “could I do something to make your day 1000x better?” then removing his shirt
13-07-2019T21:21:26,SpazztasticKiwi,same energy. and one couple of girls actually laughed at him at one point
13-07-2019T21:21:49,SpazztasticKiwi,My favorite’s gotta be Eric
13-07-2019T21:22:10,qwe304,hes the most recent part of the sketch
13-07-2019T21:22:15,SpazztasticKiwi,“Wow I’m so sexy as Santa”
13-07-2019T21:22:18,qwe304,ive been workin on it for a while
13-07-2019T21:22:26,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s good I’d say
13-07-2019T21:22:57,qwe304,anything you see wrong with it?
13-07-2019T21:23:06,qwe304,im looking for ways to improve
13-07-2019T21:23:49,SpazztasticKiwi,other than that hand maybe traces boobs
13-07-2019T21:24:03,qwe304,yeah they are a bit uneven
13-07-2019T21:24:16,Ordithus,Trace's torso is thin looking
13-07-2019T21:24:32,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s like they need a lil outline or something but knowing how boobs work I may have a bit more of a picky eye for it
13-07-2019T21:24:42,Bgrmystr2,Eric's cleavage line should probably be not as curved I feel
13-07-2019T21:25:01,qwe304,@ordithus i presumed that was an intentional part of the sketch so I replicated it
13-07-2019T21:25:03,SpazztasticKiwi,"well if you want to know the truth, boobs in real life are uneven"
13-07-2019T21:25:18,SpazztasticKiwi,every woman has one that’s a different size than the other
13-07-2019T21:25:29,qwe304,@Bgrmystr2 you are right it does seem a bit off
13-07-2019T21:25:52,Bgrmystr2,"I didn't really see anything wrong with Trace's boobs, it just seems like perspective to me"
13-07-2019T21:26:40,Bgrmystr2,"but it does, however, look somewhat like the ring for the top is a bit too far to the right"
13-07-2019T21:26:45,Bgrmystr2,rather than centered above her chest
13-07-2019T21:26:54,Bgrmystr2,"to her right, not ours"
13-07-2019T21:27:00,SpazztasticKiwi,what ring
13-07-2019T21:27:10,Bgrmystr2,the ring for trace's top
13-07-2019T21:27:13,qwe304,the boob ring thing
13-07-2019T21:27:17,Bgrmystr2,"that keeps it up, going around the neck"
13-07-2019T21:27:57,SpazztasticKiwi,looks ok to me
13-07-2019T21:28:13,SpazztasticKiwi,making anything to do with boobs act right is a chore anyway
13-07-2019T21:28:17,Bgrmystr2,haha
13-07-2019T21:28:38,qwe304,"yeah I dont have a lot of experience with boobs, I must admit"
13-07-2019T21:28:43,Bgrmystr2,"it just seems like above the ring is pointed to the right while her chest is more pointed forward, it feels like there's a slight discrepancy"
13-07-2019T21:28:48,Bgrmystr2,but it's only slight
13-07-2019T21:29:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"legit I’ve had things happen where “if it looks wonky, I dare someone to point it out”"
13-07-2019T21:29:05,SpazztasticKiwi,#notworthit
13-07-2019T21:29:32,qwe304,artists that dont want criticism .....
13-07-2019T21:29:42,qwe304,i dont even get it
13-07-2019T21:29:44,Bgrmystr2,"they have minds of their own anyway, right kiwi lol"
13-07-2019T21:29:59,SpazztasticKiwi,some days are better then others
13-07-2019T21:30:12,SpazztasticKiwi,like there’s a tumblr post that got me
13-07-2019T21:30:25,SpazztasticKiwi,“I wish boobs were removable like my glasses”
13-07-2019T21:30:51,Ordithus,Balance would require readjustment

13-07-2019T21:32:42,Ordithus,I wish I had some herbal tea... would be nice to sip that while I sit on the couch with the windows open while it rains
13-07-2019T21:33:06,qwe304,> not sitting under an unbrella outside in the rain

13-07-2019T21:36:14,Ordithus,I can smell it but I'd rather stay dry
13-07-2019T21:37:06,Ordithus,Plus my computer would definitely not like it
13-07-2019T21:39:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I just decided fec it and stayed. I’ve taken to wearing a swimsuit as part of the getup
13-07-2019T21:39:23,qwe304,@Twokinds have you considered updating the fanart section of the website?
13-07-2019T21:51:45,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve only seen two videos and I’m already sick of the giddy up challenge
13-07-2019T22:18:46,AspiringNoodle,Think I'm gonna call it an early night

13-07-2019T22:25:15,SpazztasticKiwi,dark to light green or light to dark
13-07-2019T22:25:34,Ordithus,got any context on this
13-07-2019T22:26:00,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ll take that as no this question no make sense
13-07-2019T22:26:08,SpazztasticKiwi,grass
13-07-2019T22:26:22,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m painting shadowboxes
13-07-2019T22:27:01,SpazztasticKiwi,but I’m not making realish grass. Just the color look. It’s only purpose is background
13-07-2019T22:28:21,Ordithus,"what're you feeling instinctively?  Or, maybe you can try it out a little bit before committing"
13-07-2019T22:33:41,Bgrmystr2,Kiwi do you have examples?
13-07-2019T22:41:46,SpazztasticKiwi,this is the original https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/524825976597643265/600170025298427924/image0.jpg
13-07-2019T22:42:50,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s a raised block on another piece of wood. the display is gonna be a showcase of the rosy maple moth on its namesake
13-07-2019T22:42:55,SpazztasticKiwi,the maple tree
13-07-2019T22:43:20,Bgrmystr2,ahhh
13-07-2019T22:43:48,SpazztasticKiwi,whether I’ll use the silver or red maple will be another thing
13-07-2019T22:44:13,Bgrmystr2,"it's easy, just paint some happy grass. :)"
13-07-2019T22:44:40,SpazztasticKiwi,to keep the colors from butting heads and show the moth as the center it’s likely to be the silver maple
13-07-2019T22:45:23,SpazztasticKiwi,happy grass. may just put some actual grass in - it’s basically a display box anyway
13-07-2019T22:45:50,Ordithus,crashin' hard :ctwokinds-RainezZz:

13-07-2019T23:04:52,SpazztasticKiwi,practice sheets look like a train wreck
13-07-2019T23:05:20,SpazztasticKiwi,but I’d like to know how they think those Fs look anything like fs
13-07-2019T23:08:44,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ll tend to my knit now
