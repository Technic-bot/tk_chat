25-12-2019T00:43:29,BadFoMo,Merry (belated) Christmas?
25-12-2019T00:44:06,FloofyCat,Thanksies.
25-12-2019T00:52:37,Dadrobit,"Got a pair of fuzzy slippers and an ounce of weed for Christmas. Alas, the slippers were a size too small, and I can't smoke anymore.... >.>"
25-12-2019T00:52:53,Dadrobit,Other than that it was a pretty good day.
25-12-2019T00:53:28,Dadrobit,Just cuddled with Oreo and watched some anime before work.

25-12-2019T15:35:59,SpazztasticKiwi,"I slept ~8 hours, not counting the point in the middle I woke up for no reason"
25-12-2019T15:36:03,SpazztasticKiwi,still tired
25-12-2019T15:37:45,RimaDraws,aw

25-12-2019T16:02:39,TeapotOfDoom,Also merry christmas everyone! I'm back from the family parties
25-12-2019T16:11:45,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-nibsbounce:
25-12-2019T16:25:10,CrimsonQuill,TEAPOT! Hello there! Good to see you too!
25-12-2019T16:25:18,CrimsonQuill,"Also, hello Terra"
25-12-2019T16:27:06,TeapotOfDoom,o/ terra
25-12-2019T16:27:21,CrimsonQuill,It's been a while.
25-12-2019T16:27:25,TeapotOfDoom,Indeed
25-12-2019T16:27:42,TeapotOfDoom,And you left just before you got your halfkind kiss
25-12-2019T16:27:59,CrimsonQuill,So I heard...it's now my Desktop Background.
25-12-2019T16:28:06,TeapotOfDoom,Aww
25-12-2019T16:28:16,TeapotOfDoom,Came out really cute
25-12-2019T16:28:34,TeapotOfDoom,So what have you been up to?
25-12-2019T16:28:46,CrimsonQuill,I had some things I had to sort out...
25-12-2019T16:29:03,CrimsonQuill,I felt like I didn't deserve to be in this community until I'd taken care of them.
25-12-2019T16:29:14,CrimsonQuill,I also realized that I was becoming very...belligerent.
25-12-2019T16:31:14,CrimsonQuill,"So, I promised myself that I'd sort myself out by Christmas...and...here I am now."
25-12-2019T16:31:27,CrimsonQuill,"Coming back in, it feels almost surreal."
25-12-2019T16:31:55,TeapotOfDoom,Well i think anyone can be a part of this. Honestly I've never been a part of a community so naturally inclusive
25-12-2019T16:32:27,TeapotOfDoom,I mean it get's slightly weird at times but that's ok ^^
25-12-2019T16:32:35,CrimsonQuill,There were some deeper things too that I wanted to clear up.
25-12-2019T16:32:45,TeapotOfDoom,I take it all went well?
25-12-2019T16:32:48,CrimsonQuill,I finally managed to nail that problem.
25-12-2019T16:32:54,CrimsonQuill,And a host of others.
25-12-2019T16:33:01,CrimsonQuill,For one thing...I now have a job.
25-12-2019T16:33:13,CrimsonQuill,"And for another, I am almost at my module exam."
25-12-2019T16:33:18,TeapotOfDoom,Nice
25-12-2019T16:33:23,TeapotOfDoom,Well done
25-12-2019T16:33:28,CrimsonQuill,Thanks.
25-12-2019T16:34:13,CrimsonQuill,I have decent hours...12:00 midday to 8:00pm. Afternoon shifts. So I can come home in time to catch the streams.
25-12-2019T16:34:32,CrimsonQuill,How have you been?
25-12-2019T16:34:37,TeapotOfDoom,sweet
25-12-2019T16:34:40,TeapotOfDoom,I have 2 of five of the harder exams done
25-12-2019T16:34:47,CrimsonQuill,Nice work.
25-12-2019T16:35:48,TeapotOfDoom,"The second one i really struggled. It was three exams, the two best ones would be added up to reach at least 90 points"
25-12-2019T16:36:26,TeapotOfDoom,"Was 10 points below the threshold, went back in for the oral exam and crushed it"
25-12-2019T16:37:08,CrimsonQuill,"What language? Also, Neat!"
25-12-2019T16:37:29,TeapotOfDoom,You mean the exam?
25-12-2019T16:37:35,CrimsonQuill,Yes
25-12-2019T16:37:50,TeapotOfDoom,It was about signal theory if you're refering to that
25-12-2019T16:37:59,CrimsonQuill,"Oh, I see."
25-12-2019T16:38:05,CrimsonQuill,What's signal theory?
25-12-2019T16:38:33,TeapotOfDoom,Signal theory in a discrete time space
25-12-2019T16:42:52,CrimsonQuill,I think I understand now. Thanks!
25-12-2019T16:45:19,CrimsonQuill,Wow...that must have been a lot of self-tutoring.
25-12-2019T16:45:29,CrimsonQuill,A course like that...
25-12-2019T16:47:41,CrimsonQuill,"I read the entirety of Volume 1, cover-to-cover, last night..."
25-12-2019T16:47:59,CrimsonQuill,I'm planning the same tonight with Volume 2. After that I'll take it by chapters again.
25-12-2019T16:48:10,TeapotOfDoom,you got the printed version (i assume tk?)
25-12-2019T16:48:16,CrimsonQuill,Yep
25-12-2019T16:48:23,CrimsonQuill,Two years ago actually
25-12-2019T16:48:31,CrimsonQuill,"Well, almost"
25-12-2019T16:48:38,TeapotOfDoom,I got my feet into dnd
25-12-2019T16:48:56,TeapotOfDoom,And that stuff is quicksand i tell you
25-12-2019T16:49:01,CrimsonQuill,I could theoretically play it
25-12-2019T16:49:11,CrimsonQuill,Because I am playing a similar RPG called Black Crusade.
25-12-2019T16:49:23,CrimsonQuill,I now know how all those roles work...I love it to bits!
25-12-2019T16:49:36,TeapotOfDoom,It's so much fun
25-12-2019T16:49:37,CrimsonQuill,And I really want to find a D&D group that I can join.
25-12-2019T16:49:52,CrimsonQuill,My sister made a gnome who has a really incredible hat.
25-12-2019T16:49:58,TeapotOfDoom,Haha
25-12-2019T16:50:02,CrimsonQuill,XD
25-12-2019T16:50:35,CrimsonQuill,I'm still comprehending that my suggestion was uploaded just after I left..
25-12-2019T16:50:50,CrimsonQuill,"I'm actually glad, however, that I didn't get to it till now."
25-12-2019T16:50:56,TeapotOfDoom,A friend of mine has a gnome with a cape. As a free action he can make the cape flutter in magical wind
25-12-2019T16:51:32,CrimsonQuill,My character in Black Crusade was a renegade guardsman who wanted to save the Imperium from itself (so he went to chaos)...
25-12-2019T16:51:44,CrimsonQuill,He had great ballistic and cqc skill
25-12-2019T16:51:49,CrimsonQuill,But...he went loopy.
25-12-2019T16:52:22,CrimsonQuill,He was...beheaded by a plague axe...after going mad and trying to stop the rest of the team from summoning a greater daemon of Slaneesh...
25-12-2019T16:52:42,CrimsonQuill,"It was one of the funniest things ever, but I now have to make a new character for the game."
25-12-2019T16:52:49,TeapotOfDoom,Dang
25-12-2019T16:53:29,TeapotOfDoom,My main campaign one is a changeling warlock but i made him when i had no idea of roleplaying yet
25-12-2019T16:53:46,CrimsonQuill,I cannot wait to play proper D&D...
25-12-2019T16:54:23,TeapotOfDoom,However i gave him kind of a good backstory so I may give him some proper character development in the coming sessions
25-12-2019T16:54:38,CrimsonQuill,Neat.
25-12-2019T16:54:49,TeapotOfDoom,I have some ideas
25-12-2019T16:54:56,CrimsonQuill,One of my friend's characters is a cybernetic Orangutang.
25-12-2019T16:55:12,CrimsonQuill,Orangutan? Oranutang? Orangutan?
25-12-2019T16:55:36,TeapotOfDoom,I wanna play Whinston
25-12-2019T16:55:58,TeapotOfDoom,Well gorilla. Close enough
25-12-2019T16:56:08,CrimsonQuill,Neat
25-12-2019T16:56:25,CrimsonQuill,I'm getting better and better at drawing as well.
25-12-2019T16:57:01,TeapotOfDoom,Nice. I tried and for some reasons i can do some characters really well and others not at all
25-12-2019T16:57:35,CrimsonQuill,"I haven't really tried drawing TK characters...except Raine, because I'm about to draw the cover of my fancomic"
25-12-2019T16:57:39,TeapotOfDoom,D'ya have some new stuff on your da?
25-12-2019T16:57:51,CrimsonQuill,Not much really...I've been slow on that.
25-12-2019T16:58:05,CrimsonQuill,But I have some backburning things that I am FINALLY bringing back up and finishing.
25-12-2019T16:58:29,CrimsonQuill,"My second OC's ref. sheet is nearly done, and I'm re-drawing the first page of Raine's"
25-12-2019T16:58:32,TeapotOfDoom,Ok np ^^ just wanted to know if i should hit it up
25-12-2019T16:58:48,TeapotOfDoom,Sweet
25-12-2019T16:58:52,CrimsonQuill,I'm trying to merge Tom's style with a few bits of myself for now...because I am not that good at his stuff
25-12-2019T16:59:27,CrimsonQuill,"I have a whole heap of plots, but I haven't worked out scripts yet. It's almost ready for page drafts...almost..."
25-12-2019T17:00:52,TeapotOfDoom,Nice props to you
25-12-2019T17:00:59,CrimsonQuill,Thanks
25-12-2019T17:02:39,TeapotOfDoom,I had an idea for a dnd campaign some time ago but the main thing   found interesting about it were the mechanics so i'm still lacking a story. Which should be the main part...
25-12-2019T17:03:51,TeapotOfDoom,But that's on back burner rn. Still refueling from the rather exhausting fall and then going back in for the final round
25-12-2019T17:04:19,CrimsonQuill,"I'm bringing my things together between work, study and...Halo Reach PC addiction"
25-12-2019T17:04:50,TeapotOfDoom,So you still on with that halo thing eh? xD
25-12-2019T17:05:13,CrimsonQuill,You had better believe it.
25-12-2019T17:05:42,TeapotOfDoom,In it to win it
25-12-2019T17:05:56,CrimsonQuill,"I know where AI Red is going to come from, what the prologues for each person will be like, how Spartan Bailey will work as a Leader and Spartan Adams as a team member"
25-12-2019T17:06:05,CrimsonQuill,I also made Adams Catholic. And Linguistic.
25-12-2019T17:06:27,TeapotOfDoom,Linguistic?
25-12-2019T17:06:28,CrimsonQuill,"He is fluent in English, Sangheli, Unggoy, Jiralhanae and Irish Gaelic."
25-12-2019T17:06:49,TeapotOfDoom,Holy shit
25-12-2019T17:07:05,CrimsonQuill,"(The middle three are Alien languages, and his mother taught him the Irish)"
25-12-2019T17:07:33,TeapotOfDoom,He should have an irish accent for flavour ^^
25-12-2019T17:08:08,CrimsonQuill,"...I actually had him in my head with an English accent like Bailey, but mixed ancestry."
25-12-2019T17:08:44,TeapotOfDoom,Even tho i'm really trying to get rid of my accent i really like the sound of irish accent
25-12-2019T17:09:21,CrimsonQuill,"Umm...North Dublin accents can be a bit grating, tbh"
25-12-2019T17:31:22,CrimsonQuill,"Well, I think that I will leave for the night."
25-12-2019T17:31:33,CrimsonQuill,I have a volume to read...it'll take a while.
25-12-2019T17:31:39,CrimsonQuill,And then sleep...
25-12-2019T17:32:42,TeapotOfDoom,Ok night quill! Seeya on sunday if my schedule allows
25-12-2019T17:33:04,CrimsonQuill,Goodnight Teapot! Goodnight all! :ptv-greetings::ptv-sleepy:
