10-11-2019T12:37:30,SpazztasticKiwi,"since alot of us are across different states, we yell in chat so we hear each other better"
10-11-2019T14:51:15,ThingsAreMoving,*countries
10-11-2019T16:27:48,SpazztasticKiwi,I have cheesecake your “correction” is invalid
10-11-2019T16:56:59,ThingsAreMoving,Cheesecake sounds nice. I think I'm gonna make some Tiramisu this weekend.
10-11-2019T16:57:21,ThingsAreMoving,"It has cheese in it, so technically it's a cheesecake, too... right?"
10-11-2019T17:00:07,AspiringNoodle,Sounds good to me :p
10-11-2019T17:00:28,AspiringNoodle,I think I'ma go out and get some convenience store food.  Maybe some cheesecake since they have it and chat has gone that direction
10-11-2019T18:40:25,Dadrobit,Just beat The Outer Worlds.
10-11-2019T18:40:31,Dadrobit,What a fantastic game.
10-11-2019T18:40:47,Dadrobit,It's so refreshing to just play a game and enjoy just about every moment
10-11-2019T18:42:06,Dadrobit,"Might get into it again another time in the future to platinum it, but for now, I really just feel content in beating it."
10-11-2019T18:55:06,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
10-11-2019T18:55:58,AspiringNoodle,"That game is definitely on my list of ""to plays"""
10-11-2019T18:56:10,AspiringNoodle,"That said, also resubbed to WoW, soooooo might be a bit, haha"
10-11-2019T18:57:02,AspiringNoodle,"And I take it it's like a Bethesda game, but actually good? :P"
10-11-2019T18:59:05,Dadrobit,"If Bethesda made an RPG in their stat based era of Morrowind, made an a Fallout universe, with the graphics of today, and using writers that actualy knew how to write stories..."
10-11-2019T18:59:13,Dadrobit,in a*
10-11-2019T19:01:08,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-excited:
10-11-2019T19:01:37,AspiringNoodle,And also with programmers who know how to eliminate basic bugs? :ptv-snicker:
10-11-2019T19:01:52,Dadrobit,Ehhhhhhh...
10-11-2019T19:02:21,Dadrobit,Their was one major bug in my playthrough that made an NPC and their quest unavailable
10-11-2019T19:03:13,Dadrobit,"Also, picking up stuff from boxes and corpses was constantly bugged where you'd have to look at, then look away from, then look back to the object in order to see what you could take."
10-11-2019T19:03:41,Dadrobit,"Literally constantly, affected maybe every third lootable object."
10-11-2019T19:04:34,Dadrobit,"Only took a second or two to remedy, but add those seconds up over hundreds and hundreds of lootings...."
10-11-2019T19:04:55,Dadrobit,Other than that though
10-11-2019T19:05:38,AspiringNoodle,I might need to start wearing headphones while gaming
10-11-2019T19:05:46,AspiringNoodle,"Also, awwwww"
10-11-2019T19:05:52,AspiringNoodle,"I believe in you, Obsidian!"

10-11-2019T20:09:10,TraceLegacyXI,anyone?
10-11-2019T20:21:13,AspiringNoodle,Howdy howdy howdy
10-11-2019T20:53:53,JojoF2415,Howdy
10-11-2019T23:50:12,AspiringNoodle,Bethesda... just... why
10-11-2019T23:50:41,AspiringNoodle,Bethesda will die.  I'm calling it now.  The next game they launch is going to be a flop because they've garnered so much bad rep over the past year.
