02-01-2019T00:00:36,RimaDraws,yea for our science classes we had a 2 hour lecture then a one hour and 45 min lab to do on one day out of the two day class
02-01-2019T00:01:39,MrEase,though I miss life drawing
02-01-2019T00:02:07,RimaDraws,i loved life drawing. may get to help teach it with my art teacher this summer
02-01-2019T00:19:13,Dadrobit,"Late to the party, but I did encounter one 3 hour class myself. Loved the shit out of it though. It was ""Advanced audio engineering and mixing techniques"" or something like that."
02-01-2019T00:19:42,Dadrobit,Just 3 hours in the studio with 5 other students and the professor.
02-01-2019T00:21:07,Dadrobit,Final day was just spent mixing the original audio stems for Bohemian Rhapsody in 5.1 surround.
02-01-2019T00:21:19,Dadrobit,Had a great time.
02-01-2019T00:22:26,Dadrobit,Standard Sound Design classes were all 2 hours and I ended up spending many afternoons in that class well beyond just working on whatever I could.
02-01-2019T00:23:51,unsteddyphoenix,Mixing bohemian rhapsody how?
02-01-2019T00:24:44,RimaDraws,oooh

02-01-2019T00:25:16,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve never heard BR but I‚Äôve listened to I Want to Break Free
02-01-2019T00:25:42,Bgrmystr2,"But was it real life, Dadro? Or was it just fantasy? :v"
02-01-2019T00:25:50,SpazztasticKiwi,:ptv-unimpressed:
02-01-2019T00:25:51,Dadrobit,My professor had the original stems that were tracked and unmixed. So we made our own mix in the studio in surround sound.
02-01-2019T00:25:59,SpazztasticKiwi,You just had to didn‚Äôt you
02-01-2019T00:26:12,Bgrmystr2,Who fucking wouldn't? xD
02-01-2019T00:26:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"Mercury, Jackson, and some Elvis"
02-01-2019T00:26:55,SpazztasticKiwi,"Dunno what it is, but I‚Äôve jumped into some old stuff lately"
02-01-2019T00:27:31,SpazztasticKiwi,And old soundtracks
02-01-2019T00:27:43,Dadrobit,"They're out there somewhere, but unfortunately I don't have them myself."
02-01-2019T00:28:10,Dadrobit,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkM0aWwHkzU Like it would appear this person has/had access to them as well.

02-01-2019T01:39:06,CrimsonQuill,Bye
02-01-2019T01:39:12,CrimsonQuill,:ptv-greetings:
02-01-2019T01:51:31,Dadrobit,"Yeah, that was Roger Taylor and I believe Brian May complaing at the end of one of the takes during the recording of Bohemian Rhapsody."
02-01-2019T01:52:23,Dadrobit,"Roger joking about ""banging about for the last ten minutes,"" while the other exasperatedly expresses ""ahhhh fuck it."""
02-01-2019T02:22:08,unsteddyphoenix,That is extremely british
02-01-2019T02:29:30,Dadrobit,There's a fair amount of stuff that never made it to the final cut.
02-01-2019T02:30:14,Dadrobit,"It's fun to solo things out and hear everything as it really was before the engineers made it ""perfect""."
02-01-2019T02:35:54,Dadrobit,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvyx_ZZOm8 Here's the song's mastertracks before their final mixdown for the curious.

02-01-2019T13:37:16,iliar,"Hmm ... I think this is pretty good. Of course death is bad. But I like the idea of life after death. If this happens, technically you will be dead, but for other people you will be still alive for while."
02-01-2019T13:37:41,Azumachan,Good Morning Iliar
02-01-2019T13:38:08,iliar,"Good morning, Azuma!"
02-01-2019T13:40:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh there was a spiel where a few of marks fand thought he was dead for a while a few months ago so

02-01-2019T13:46:53,iliar,"Now I think what will happen if I die. Bot will work for while. Then something goes wrong and, at best case, the bot will break. In the worst case, the bot will start spamming messages."
02-01-2019T13:47:49,iliar,Probably I will even buy several Nora Cards before my accounts are blocked.
02-01-2019T13:48:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Movie now

02-01-2019T15:46:11,CrimsonQuill,One of my resolutions was to only stay up late to follow the streams.
02-01-2019T15:46:17,Bgrmystr2,generally a lack of focus will do that.
02-01-2019T15:46:18,CrimsonQuill,Looks like it has cracks forming.
02-01-2019T15:46:51,CrimsonQuill,"As it is, we saw a film today-'Crimes of Grindelwald'."
02-01-2019T15:46:59,CrimsonQuill,And came home fairly late.
02-01-2019T15:47:07,CrimsonQuill,It's 8:47pm
02-01-2019T15:47:21,CrimsonQuill,"But since I'm rather tired, I might take an early night."
02-01-2019T15:48:41,Bgrmystr2,I had $100 worth of tech come in a very small package today

02-01-2019T15:48:57,Bgrmystr2,so yeah I'd be not happy if it was open and empty
02-01-2019T15:49:20,CrimsonQuill,"I gazed longingly at a second hand xbox one that I wanted , so I could play the Master Collection."
02-01-2019T15:49:32,CrimsonQuill,I can't really afford something like that at present.
02-01-2019T15:49:42,CrimsonQuill,"Or the game itself, come to think about it."
02-01-2019T15:49:47,Bgrmystr2,I don't want it honestly.
02-01-2019T15:52:14,Bgrmystr2,5 is the only one that it comes with that I don't have
02-01-2019T15:52:20,Bgrmystr2,and my friend has it.
02-01-2019T15:52:41,Bgrmystr2,so I legit don't need it nor do I want to buy a new console to get games I already own :u
02-01-2019T15:52:46,CrimsonQuill,I just want all four MC games...and nice multiplayer.

02-01-2019T15:53:37,CrimsonQuill,We weren't allowed to game regularly until rather recently.
02-01-2019T16:05:03,CrimsonQuill,"A few years ago, in fact."

02-01-2019T19:27:20,Azumachan,Can a dragon burn him/herself while drinking a hot coffee
02-01-2019T19:27:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Fire can‚Äôt burn a dragon
02-01-2019T19:28:19,Azumachan,Yes but Dragon fire is magic
02-01-2019T19:28:45,Azumachan,a Hot coffee isn't magically hot.
02-01-2019T19:29:07,Xexanoth,"depends on the dragons, some universe go for a more ""realistic"" approach."
02-01-2019T19:30:13,Azumachan,This could be fun I think
02-01-2019T19:30:59,Azumachan,Nora/Reni not handling a hot beverage very well
02-01-2019T19:31:17,Bgrmystr2,they breathe fire. It would barely affect them at all
02-01-2019T19:31:29,Bgrmystr2,"it's shown in the comic, Reni is drinking a steaming pot of coffee"
02-01-2019T19:31:41,Azumachan,As a joke.
02-01-2019T19:34:40,Xexanoth,"or reverse it, they get brainfreeze from ice cream"
02-01-2019T19:35:16,Bgrmystr2,"now that, xex, is probably much more likely xD"
02-01-2019T19:35:23,Azumachan,Flora/Trace being allergic to cat
02-01-2019T19:36:35,Azumachan,cat fur*
02-01-2019T19:39:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Trace. Allergic to cat hair.
02-01-2019T19:39:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Why don‚Äôt you just shoot him
02-01-2019T19:40:38,unsteddyphoenix,Thats a mercy kill tbh
02-01-2019T19:41:17,Xexanoth,at least he doesn't have the same deadly allergy to arrows as Saria.
02-01-2019T19:42:41,Azumachan,Too soon ?
02-01-2019T19:43:51,unsteddyphoenix,Or lauras weakness to magic explosions
02-01-2019T19:44:04,Bgrmystr2,"..to be fair, Trace would probably have the same allergic reaction to the arrow as Saria did."
02-01-2019T20:04:13,ZahnHolley,Hey whats going on a round here?
02-01-2019T20:29:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Think a VS person could tell you your body type?
02-01-2019T20:43:41,Mippy,Taking early American Lit this semester. Teacher is starting us off with Irving. Gotta read Sleepy Hollow for Tuesday. I haven‚Äôt read that story since high school. Gonna be fun.
02-01-2019T20:56:10,Dadrobit,"""VS person"" ?"
02-01-2019T20:57:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Victoria‚Äôs Secret
02-01-2019T20:57:49,Dadrobit,"Yeah, they'd probably call my type ""missing in action""."
02-01-2019T20:58:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Not ‚Äúdad-in-training‚Äù?
02-01-2019T20:59:24,unsteddyphoenix,True you need to get yourself a dad bod
02-01-2019T20:59:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Or ‚Äúpending paternal person‚Äù?
02-01-2019T21:00:37,Dadrobit,I don't wan't a dad bod. I want them to look at me and think ~Daddy~~~
02-01-2019T21:01:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Look like Jason Momoa
02-01-2019T21:01:14,SpazztasticKiwi,He got people thirsty
02-01-2019T21:01:27,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah thats pretty easy
02-01-2019T21:01:36,Dadrobit,I'm sticking with Flynn Rider.
02-01-2019T21:01:56,Dadrobit,The Smoulder
02-01-2019T21:02:00,SpazztasticKiwi,"And since he has three kids, it‚Äôs a dad bod"
02-01-2019T21:02:33,Dadrobit,Flynn or Jason?
02-01-2019T21:02:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Jason
02-01-2019T21:03:31,Dadrobit,"I might match the hair one day, but the dude's beard is only a dream for me."
02-01-2019T21:04:03,SpazztasticKiwi,I will say I used to hate facial hair
02-01-2019T21:04:21,Dadrobit,"Also, looking at images of him now. He seems to be in a perpetual state of mild surprise."
02-01-2019T21:04:36,SpazztasticKiwi,High eyebrows
02-01-2019T21:04:44,Dadrobit,Highbrows
02-01-2019T21:04:56,SpazztasticKiwi,"He‚Äôs Norwegian, you know that right"
02-01-2019T21:05:11,Dadrobit,I gathered it
02-01-2019T21:05:38,SpazztasticKiwi,At least I‚Äôve heard genetically
02-01-2019T21:05:43,RimaDraws,hm
02-01-2019T21:05:51,SpazztasticKiwi,But he‚Äôs Hawaiian born
02-01-2019T21:08:07,SpazztasticKiwi,...he‚Äôs also almost 40
02-01-2019T21:08:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Wat
02-01-2019T21:15:10,SpazztasticKiwi,"Jason aside, there‚Äôs plenty of other looks considered hot nowadays. Just like how I say Jason‚Äôs attractive but still not my type, you‚Äôre sure to be someone‚Äôs type out there"
02-01-2019T21:39:12,Mippy,:ctwokinds-reniderp_flip:
02-01-2019T21:59:21,unsteddyphoenix,"If I swung for the other team, jason would definetly be my type~"
02-01-2019T22:02:24,SpazztasticKiwi,He is rather fluffy
02-01-2019T22:02:42,Dadrobit,He's a bit on the bulky side imho. Still holding out for Iseiah Mustafa myself.
02-01-2019T22:03:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Bulky
02-01-2019T22:03:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Like hugging a mountain
02-01-2019T22:03:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah that‚Äôs not my taste
02-01-2019T22:04:01,unsteddyphoenix,He could carry me around! :D
02-01-2019T22:04:09,unsteddyphoenix,Sounds good to me
02-01-2019T22:05:51,Dadrobit,"Highschool Sweetheart was very athletic, fantastically toned. Can confirm that dating someone pleasantly buff is actually the best."
02-01-2019T22:06:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Presently
02-01-2019T22:06:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe
02-01-2019T22:06:31,SpazztasticKiwi,But not a cloud or bodybuilder
02-01-2019T22:06:57,unsteddyphoenix,"I wouldnt know, never been with someone fit lol"
02-01-2019T22:07:00,Dadrobit,"Nah, fuck that. She was a swimmer."
02-01-2019T22:07:03,SpazztasticKiwi,How about Kellan Lutz?
02-01-2019T22:07:06,unsteddyphoenix,"Never been fit either, but..."
02-01-2019T22:07:08,unsteddyphoenix,A cloud?
02-01-2019T22:08:28,Dadrobit,Dunno him. But a quick Bing search tells me that he looks fine.
02-01-2019T22:08:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Too much steroid/injection: http://img.izismile.com/img/img5/20121203/640/funny_picdump_336_640_13.jpg
02-01-2019T22:08:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Cloud
02-01-2019T22:08:54,unsteddyphoenix,"Hahaha, I see"
02-01-2019T22:08:57,Dadrobit,"Oof, I've seen muscles like that explode. Not pretty."
02-01-2019T22:09:28,unsteddyphoenix,Irl or?
02-01-2019T22:10:21,Dadrobit,not in person. But videos.
02-01-2019T22:10:32,unsteddyphoenix,Sounds. Very gross.
02-01-2019T22:12:06,Dadrobit,"Entire area around the muscle turns a fascinating shade of ""strawberries and plumbs"""
02-01-2019T23:29:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Just tryin to be colorful
