20-01-2019T00:17:08,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s still some white but it fades into a deep orange and almost red at the other end
20-01-2019T00:20:37,Ordithus,Kiwi did you see my pic?
20-01-2019T00:22:01,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s surrounded by the spattering of stars and the thin fingers of the trees who reach for

20-01-2019T00:25:21,SpazztasticKiwi,It’d be nice to get a picture where I see. We’re the only house on this hill - my grandma’s just a lil further down the road - so you can see the trees and stars

20-01-2019T14:35:34,RimaDraws,so funny its only almost been a month and i get praise for not butchering natani's identity on the art i did of him
20-01-2019T14:35:46,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-natsducky:
20-01-2019T14:36:08,RimaDraws,like: i just drew him and he's one of my fav characters in the comic.

20-01-2019T14:38:24,RimaDraws,i just try to keep natani close to the design as possible. clovis was a challenge to draw as a female because ive never seen clovis as anything other than male

20-01-2019T14:38:40,TerraTheWizard,tasty tasty salt

20-01-2019T14:40:03,ThingsAreMoving,I feel like that hair bundle on Nat's right side needs a bit more shadowing
20-01-2019T14:40:26,RimaDraws,i cant go back and edit that lol
20-01-2019T14:40:40,RimaDraws,once its done its done but i may remember that in the future. thanks for the feedback
20-01-2019T14:40:52,RimaDraws,like his right?
20-01-2019T14:40:53,ThingsAreMoving,"cause the first ting I thought was... huh, that's an irregular cheek, or what?"
20-01-2019T14:41:11,ThingsAreMoving,"Nah, when you look at it as it is"
20-01-2019T14:41:23,RimaDraws,oooh his left then gotcha
20-01-2019T14:42:38,ThingsAreMoving,"Other than that, It's a nice Nat. Be proud."
20-01-2019T14:42:48,RimaDraws,https://pre00.deviantart.net/afe9/th/pre/i/2019/005/7/f/princess_clovis__twokinds__by_rimadraws-dcwaqwh.png this was the clovis drawing i did. i just cant believe i nailed the smugness of this one
20-01-2019T14:42:52,RimaDraws,and thanks

20-01-2019T14:43:40,RimaDraws,tbh clovis is difficult face wise because of being a folf. the wolf shows more than the fox breed in her
20-01-2019T14:44:13,RimaDraws,but i can see a bit of the fox where the bridge of the nose actually narrows unlike the wolf muzzle
20-01-2019T14:46:06,ThingsAreMoving,I usually discern foxes and wolves by the presence or absence of socks
20-01-2019T14:46:39,ThingsAreMoving,Buuuut I guess foxes should have a more narrow muzzle
20-01-2019T14:47:15,RimaDraws,"the perspective on this one mainly frontal perspective. and to get it right it took me a ton of editing where the eyes were, how the nose was positioned. it took me a couple references to seehow to position everything"
20-01-2019T14:49:21,ThingsAreMoving,"Do you like, open several other images and just rework your drawing until it looks more or less like some of those references?"
20-01-2019T14:50:58,RimaDraws,i do try to see how it would be positioned with many references. i try to get at least three or four pictures and then use those as a reference to see how the nose or whatever im editing should look like.
20-01-2019T14:51:25,RimaDraws,in this drawing it took me three or four time to get the nose right and the eyes maybe two times. now that i look back on this i see the ear is off on the one side there
20-01-2019T14:52:36,RimaDraws,i really need to use the invert tool more
20-01-2019T14:53:14,ThingsAreMoving,"I'm not even going to pretend I know what this tool does, lol"
20-01-2019T14:53:51,RimaDraws,it inverts the canvas to look like its mirrored. that way you can adjust your stuff to look even and proportionate
20-01-2019T14:54:47,RimaDraws,its complicated to say unless you see whats going on in front of you. i can show better than i can tell
20-01-2019T14:55:28,ThingsAreMoving,"Oh, I know what you're talking about"
20-01-2019T14:55:33,RimaDraws,yee
20-01-2019T14:56:08,ThingsAreMoving,"yeah, I think Tom uses it on occasion. I vaguely remember him explaining why he does it."
20-01-2019T14:56:48,ThingsAreMoving,flipping the picture makes it easier to spot uneven stuff
20-01-2019T14:56:58,ThingsAreMoving,to put it roughly
20-01-2019T14:57:24,RimaDraws,yea!
20-01-2019T14:57:31,RimaDraws,that is pretty much it
20-01-2019T14:58:19,ThingsAreMoving,"I used to doodle stuff, but I had problems with focus, one minute I knew what I wanted it to look like, even managed to visualize it on paper, but when I started sketching it out It was gone."
20-01-2019T14:58:59,RimaDraws,ouch. wait you do digital drawing?
20-01-2019T14:59:23,ThingsAreMoving,I don't. It was waaaaay back in high school.
20-01-2019T14:59:36,ThingsAreMoving,Pen and pencil.
20-01-2019T15:00:13,RimaDraws,oh yea old fashioned traditional is crazy
20-01-2019T15:00:23,ThingsAreMoving,In the end I dropped visual art and focused on cooking. Cutting stuff evenly is much easier than drawing straight lines for me
20-01-2019T15:02:12,RimaDraws,i cant draw straight lines but i try
20-01-2019T15:05:58,ThingsAreMoving,Well even if you can't draw straight lines those two art pieces turned out :ctwokinds-KeithNeat:
20-01-2019T15:06:11,RimaDraws,i use a lineart layer. i just go with the flow
20-01-2019T15:06:12,RimaDraws,lol
20-01-2019T15:08:02,ThingsAreMoving,"Right, lineart layer. The stuff that works in a particular way that is useful for... drawing!"
20-01-2019T15:08:19,RimaDraws,it works okay for me then it does things i dont want it to
20-01-2019T15:08:28,ThingsAreMoving,I don't even know what that is xD
20-01-2019T15:08:59,RimaDraws,well when i erase and only want a certain part to erase it erases a line i dont want it to too
20-01-2019T15:09:10,ThingsAreMoving,"I mean I understand layers, I have some experience with photoshop."
20-01-2019T15:09:47,RimaDraws,i wish i could afford photoshop monthly so i can draw with it.
20-01-2019T15:09:53,RimaDraws,its a good program to have
20-01-2019T15:10:17,ThingsAreMoving,"Rome wasn't built in a day, you know."
20-01-2019T15:10:29,ThingsAreMoving,You'll get there in time.
20-01-2019T15:11:54,RimaDraws,i do hope so. i need to save up for a decent computer that can hold everything and not be slow as crap.
20-01-2019T16:51:12,Bgrmystr2,"just get something like clip studio, it's way cheaper, goes on sale so very often, and is arguably equal to photoshop without extorting money from you"
20-01-2019T16:51:56,Bgrmystr2,and gmornin

20-01-2019T16:52:37,TerraTheWizard,and it goes on sale like 4 times a year
20-01-2019T16:53:14,TerraTheWizard,so get it when it's cheapo

20-01-2019T19:49:52,MrMongMong,It
20-01-2019T19:49:57,MrMongMong,'ll only take a few years.
20-01-2019T19:52:06,Bgrmystr2,Lol you have problems with clip? cuz it's not actually bad.
20-01-2019T20:01:05,MrMongMong,"I meant it more as a joke, I like the way Clip can draw lines cleanly, but I still prefer Krita, even if it is super unintuitive."
20-01-2019T20:01:39,Bgrmystr2,big whiff then. it just came off as salt :u

20-01-2019T20:21:12,Bgrmystr2,naw it's pretty accurate.
20-01-2019T20:22:00,Dadrobit,Not if you're taking someone seriously after they made the suggestion of hard coding every pixel with Java instead.
20-01-2019T20:22:30,Bgrmystr2,Then clearly you have not met enough people who have really shit analogies for why they think something is actually bad.
20-01-2019T20:25:00,Dadrobit,That just sounds like your own salt being so explosively bad that you can't help but get it on other people's statements.
20-01-2019T20:25:09,Dadrobit,*Poof*
20-01-2019T20:25:46,Bgrmystr2,"So instead of an actual rebuttal, you just resort to attacking me personally."

20-01-2019T20:31:30,Dadrobit,The dude is super protective of that trademark. He shut down one concert recently midway through it because the lead used it to start off the show.
20-01-2019T20:31:47,Ordithus,Wow
20-01-2019T20:32:04,Bgrmystr2,"Hoo, it's like he thinks he's above the law."
20-01-2019T20:32:23,Ordithus,Or is the law
20-01-2019T20:32:27,Dadrobit,He is the law.
20-01-2019T20:32:27,Bgrmystr2,Perhaps.
20-01-2019T20:33:06,ThingsAreMoving,How the fuck are you allowed to trademark words is beyond me.
20-01-2019T20:33:28,Bgrmystr2,"It's not really a thing, it's been shut down many times in the past."
20-01-2019T20:33:35,Dadrobit,Buffer trademarked and has made hundreds of millions of dollars.
20-01-2019T20:33:35,Bgrmystr2,How he gets away with it is beyond me.
20-01-2019T20:33:43,Dadrobit,trademarked it*
20-01-2019T20:34:03,Dadrobit,"It's not the words itself, it's the presentation of them."
20-01-2019T20:34:36,Bgrmystr2,So I guess it's illegal to say those words without paying him money. He's a crock off his rocker lol
20-01-2019T20:34:36,Dadrobit,"Fun fact: Buffer's brother trademarked ""It's Time!"""
20-01-2019T20:35:03,Dadrobit,That's literally the exact opposite of what I said.
20-01-2019T20:35:03,Ordithus,...
20-01-2019T20:35:12,ThingsAreMoving,I'd trademark their surnames
20-01-2019T20:35:25,Ordithus,I have no idea what you are talking about Mr. Buffer
20-01-2019T20:35:39,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-wink: I never said such words
20-01-2019T20:35:42,Dadrobit,"It's fine to say ""Let's get ready to rumble."" It's not okay to yell, ""Let's get ready to ruuuuuumbllllle!"""
20-01-2019T20:35:48,Bgrmystr2,There's no difference between saying the words and presenting something with said words. They're spoken either way.
20-01-2019T20:35:57,Dadrobit,especially right before a fighting match.
20-01-2019T20:36:52,Dadrobit,And speaking them is fine. Speaking them in such a way that Michael Buffer would is not okay.
20-01-2019T20:37:09,ThingsAreMoving,"I see your point, dad."
20-01-2019T20:37:19,Bgrmystr2,Honestly it just sounds to me like he's just trying to make a buck
20-01-2019T20:37:36,Dadrobit,"More and most importantly, it's not okay when you are using it in such a manner or place that you are making money."
20-01-2019T20:37:55,Ordithus,In the clear
20-01-2019T20:37:59,Dadrobit,Everyone's just trying to make a buck.
20-01-2019T20:38:03,Bgrmystr2,"I think that's the only time I would respect him in that, because a catchphrase used commercially I can understand."
20-01-2019T20:38:07,ThingsAreMoving,It's like... porky the pig could trademark hi 'that's all folks!' yeah?

20-01-2019T20:39:08,Ordithus,I am overjoyed
20-01-2019T20:39:12,Bgrmystr2,But is that the ONLY reason you have internet and electricity?
20-01-2019T20:39:20,Bgrmystr2,or do you have it for other purposes?
20-01-2019T20:39:28,Bgrmystr2,other more important purposes..?
20-01-2019T20:39:36,ThingsAreMoving,"stupid question, we all know what internet is for"
20-01-2019T20:39:39,Ordithus,These could be argued

20-01-2019T20:43:31,ThingsAreMoving,What do you mean he didn't come up with the presentation of this word
20-01-2019T20:43:49,Bgrmystr2,You've never been to a ghetto have you lol
20-01-2019T20:43:54,ThingsAreMoving,you think someone coached him in the ways of 'mothafucka' ?
20-01-2019T20:44:01,Bgrmystr2,probably.
20-01-2019T20:44:06,Bgrmystr2,or he just picked it up
20-01-2019T20:44:08,ThingsAreMoving,Can't say I have.
