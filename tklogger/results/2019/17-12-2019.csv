17-12-2019T22:25:18,SpazztasticKiwi,just walked into walmart
17-12-2019T22:25:28,SpazztasticKiwi,ina tank top
17-12-2019T22:25:36,Ordithus,stay classy
17-12-2019T22:26:01,SpazztasticKiwi,there’s another wearing shorts
17-12-2019T22:26:11,SpazztasticKiwi,bruh do you not feel a breeze
17-12-2019T22:26:20,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s colder than a witch’s tit
17-12-2019T22:26:32,Ordithus,seems cold
17-12-2019T22:27:35,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s 30 degrees
17-12-2019T22:27:45,Ordithus,Dat be chilly
17-12-2019T22:27:51,Ordithus,Not shorts and tank top weather
17-12-2019T22:28:01,SpazztasticKiwi,dudes gonna chase his family jewels up to his armpits
17-12-2019T22:28:20,Ordithus,And this is coming from someone currently experiencing 3 degrees... well outside.  It's nice inside.
17-12-2019T22:42:21,SpazztasticKiwi,mother nature heard we took our coats off yesterday and decided to remind us it was winter
17-12-2019T22:42:59,SpazztasticKiwi,"only problem with that is, southerners are stubborn to the point of borderline stupid"
17-12-2019T22:43:21,SpazztasticKiwi,so you end up getting digbats wearing tank tops and shorts in 30 degrees
17-12-2019T22:47:32,Ordithus,The ole switcheroo
17-12-2019T22:52:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I ever mention the little boy I heard begging his mom not to make him follow her in the ladies room
17-12-2019T23:14:41,Ordithus,nope
17-12-2019T23:27:48,SpazztasticKiwi,he asked to wait outside and everything but the lady. - mom I guess - insisted he stay with her in eyesight
17-12-2019T23:28:00,SpazztasticKiwi,had to assure him that they’d be in a stall
17-12-2019T23:28:12,SpazztasticKiwi,kid acted like he was afraid of the room
17-12-2019T23:28:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"not like she’s gonna try putting you back where you came, kid"
17-12-2019T23:29:33,SpazztasticKiwi,most parents I see take their kids in have them wait at the sinks or “stand guard”at their stall door
17-12-2019T23:30:10,Ordithus,so he wasn't having it
17-12-2019T23:30:40,SpazztasticKiwi,it was legit like he was afraid the ladies restroom was going to eat him or something
17-12-2019T23:31:06,SpazztasticKiwi,and to be fair he looked old enough to wait outside the door for a hot second
17-12-2019T23:31:19,Ordithus,"anti-male security system, vaporizes all intruders"
17-12-2019T23:31:33,SpazztasticKiwi,nice that she was so dedicated to keeping an eye on him
17-12-2019T23:31:47,SpazztasticKiwi,with the kids going missing lately I don’t fully blame her
17-12-2019T23:32:08,Ordithus,kids going missing?
17-12-2019T23:32:28,SpazztasticKiwi,yeah a little girl was kidnapped in the area awhile back
17-12-2019T23:32:46,Ordithus,"damn, that's horrible"
17-12-2019T23:33:59,SpazztasticKiwi,my cousin I know takes her sons everywhere with her in a store
17-12-2019T23:37:00,Ordithus,"I'm sleepy, I sleep now.  Good night, kiwi"
17-12-2019T23:37:02,SpazztasticKiwi,unrelated - I found a heart shaped chip
17-12-2019T23:37:08,SpazztasticKiwi,quitter
17-12-2019T23:37:10,Ordithus,eat your heart out
17-12-2019T23:37:18,SpazztasticKiwi,what heart
17-12-2019T23:37:30,Ordithus,the - nevermind
