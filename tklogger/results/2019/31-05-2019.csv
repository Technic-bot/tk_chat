31-05-2019T00:12:17,AspiringNoodle,Art becomes so much less intimidating when you see it broken down into simple steps.
31-05-2019T00:12:17,Akirameerkat,"its just after midnight for me, thoguh thats central time"

31-05-2019T00:17:41,AspiringNoodle,"I swear to Nibbly, the moment CSP or Affinity Photo goes on sale, I'm starting a trial and gonna crunch the heck out of that software."
31-05-2019T00:17:55,AspiringNoodle,See if it feels good :p
31-05-2019T00:18:05,Bgrmystr2,"My friend asked what happened to all the other kids, Sclim. So I told them they all burned because they were lit. :ptv-laugh::fire::fire::fire:"
31-05-2019T00:18:29,Sclimshady,Or did they have pumped up kicks?
31-05-2019T00:18:36,Mihari,Why do you need to wait for a sale to do the trial?
31-05-2019T00:18:46,Bgrmystr2,xD

31-05-2019T00:20:01,AspiringNoodle,"Now that I think about it, since CSP has a month-long trial, and a sale should be soon, now would be a good time to try it"
31-05-2019T00:20:05,Sclimshady,Let the art flow through you
31-05-2019T00:20:29,Ordithus,:csagesaga-nynasmirk: order one or kaylin will steal your turnover
31-05-2019T00:20:43,AspiringNoodle,...That smug-looking nekomimi in the bottom left corner is a compelling reason to purchase the book.
31-05-2019T00:21:03,AspiringNoodle,Look at that smirk.  You know you want to!
31-05-2019T00:21:04,Sclimshady,:csagesaga-c1:Not my turnover!

31-05-2019T01:17:08,SageSaga,Rieko is a robot girl now because the original her was beaten to death by a group of people with tire irons when she was 16
31-05-2019T01:17:27,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: sounds like an anime
31-05-2019T01:17:31,Bgrmystr2,obvious comedy

31-05-2019T01:19:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,if it lets her live then clothes are welcomed
31-05-2019T01:19:33,AspiringNoodle,"If clothing is the ultimate in censorship, then removing all skin is the ultimate in vulgarity?"

31-05-2019T01:20:37,Bgrmystr2,I dunno how the hell that leap of logic happened xD
31-05-2019T01:21:12,AspiringNoodle,"Okay, back to cute girls with tragic pasts, so I'm guessing NO ONE has watched Guilty Crown besides me"
31-05-2019T01:21:26,Bgrmystr2,nope lol

31-05-2019T01:22:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,sounds like walking dead
31-05-2019T01:22:38,Bgrmystr2,I already know of it
31-05-2019T01:22:43,Bgrmystr2,I just haven't watched it

31-05-2019T15:32:58,AspiringNoodle,Yeah... our house has like 2.5x the yard of other houses.
31-05-2019T15:33:49,AspiringNoodle,"It's silly, really.  We have too big a yard and too small a house.  It's like they didn't know what they were doing when making it."

31-05-2019T15:34:44,xcvb,how much of a land do you have @AspiringNoodle

31-05-2019T15:35:13,AspiringNoodle,And I'll be so happy when I no longer have to deal with it
31-05-2019T15:35:37,xcvb,so much negative thinking
31-05-2019T15:36:25,xcvb,think about it in terms of what you CAN do with it

31-05-2019T17:41:51,Bgrmystr2,I've probably grabbed less than 1% from it.

31-05-2019T17:42:08,xcvb,I know that feeling
31-05-2019T17:42:21,Bgrmystr2,but to know simply when I hear something I really like..
31-05-2019T17:42:34,Bgrmystr2,"I can just go into that folder, find the band and album"
31-05-2019T17:42:38,Bgrmystr2,and grab it.

31-05-2019T17:44:24,xcvb,"you do look for music, not songs"
31-05-2019T17:45:36,Bgrmystr2,"I generally look for a particular song I like if I hear it, then proceed to check the band for other stuff sometime at a later date."
31-05-2019T17:45:53,Bgrmystr2,it becomes more of a priority if I keep hearing songs from said band that I enjoy
