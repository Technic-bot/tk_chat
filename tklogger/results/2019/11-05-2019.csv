11-05-2019T06:59:49,Bgrmystr2,"also, bout to go to bed, been fighting computer garbage all weekend."

11-05-2019T07:04:36,Nekonny,"THis animation project has been taking up almost all my time ^^"""
11-05-2019T07:05:23,Bgrmystr2,"My computer's explorer.exe is fighting me tooth and nail to just not boot at all, so I'm gonna have to restart again, but it's already 7am so I'm gonna just kill the thing with fire and go to bed."

11-05-2019T07:11:22,Nekonny,ah ok ^^
11-05-2019T07:11:33,Nekonny,not sure whty I thought it was black XD
11-05-2019T07:12:17,Shaze,it's all good üòä I don't think we actually talked colors before
11-05-2019T07:20:44,Shaze,it's do cool how you do gold :ptv-excited:
11-05-2019T07:22:17,Nekonny,I havet had much practice with gold
11-05-2019T07:22:30,Nekonny,but I do have a few pics i ref every so often

11-05-2019T07:30:49,happyguyone,cool drawing by the way.
11-05-2019T07:31:02,Nekonny,Thanks ^^
11-05-2019T07:31:05,Nekonny,and I don't know
11-05-2019T07:31:36,Nekonny,that one was sort of espontaneous because I wan't ready to work on comic stuff
11-05-2019T07:31:50,Nekonny,"truth be told, I have to focus fridays on comic work"
11-05-2019T07:31:55,Nekonny,and stick to the scedule
11-05-2019T07:32:13,Nekonny,friday just tends to creep up so quickly
11-05-2019T07:34:44,happyguyone,it's all good and Monday's are my off day at times. XD
11-05-2019T07:37:41,happyguyone,Also I think it would be for you to do a pic of Ron meeting Garfield while he's in cat form.
11-05-2019T07:37:54,happyguyone,*cute
11-05-2019T07:39:28,Nekonny,I don't quite get whats been going on with Garfield over the past few years
11-05-2019T07:39:42,Nekonny,he's just become the subject of way too much creepy pasta
11-05-2019T07:42:53,CrRAR,It seems to have started with that existential spinoff about original panels with Garfield removed that was basically just Jon having conversations with himself.
11-05-2019T07:43:00,CrRAR,https://garfieldminusgarfield.net/
11-05-2019T07:43:14,Nekonny,yeah
11-05-2019T07:43:26,Nekonny,most recently with gorefield
11-05-2019T07:43:35,CrRAR,They took that and kicked it up to 11
11-05-2019T07:43:45,CrRAR,...and possibly snapped off the dial xD
11-05-2019T07:44:04,Nekonny,"theres been a running joke about comic strips that arent actually ""funny"" so to speak"
11-05-2019T07:44:15,Nekonny,like family circus and garfield being too examples
11-05-2019T07:45:19,CrRAR,yeah
11-05-2019T07:46:37,happyguyone,The creepiest Garfield comic I read as a kid was the one about him having the nightmare waking up in an a abandoned house.
11-05-2019T07:49:05,Nekonny,that too
11-05-2019T07:49:08,Nekonny,so yeah
11-05-2019T07:49:45,Nekonny,I never really felt the desire to reference Garfield
11-05-2019T07:50:38,Nekonny,although... somehow I recall doing a lazanha joke
11-05-2019T07:50:46,Nekonny,need to look that up now
11-05-2019T07:50:52,Nekonny,Shaze! It's done ^^
11-05-2019T07:51:13,Shaze,\o/
11-05-2019T07:53:40,Nekonny,there it is XD
11-05-2019T07:54:37,Shaze,I remember that page now lol
11-05-2019T07:56:36,Nekonny,heh
11-05-2019T07:57:03,Nekonny,I kind of liked this one ^^ '
11-05-2019T07:57:21,Shaze,XD
11-05-2019T07:58:57,Nekonny,and then Tina on Line ended
11-05-2019T07:59:05,Nekonny,and Nekonny was never heard from again
11-05-2019T08:01:05,Nekonny,brb
11-05-2019T08:02:41,Nekonny,"actually, going to take a longer break to get the day started XD"
11-05-2019T08:02:53,Nekonny,just wanted to finish this up a

11-05-2019T08:03:07,Nekonny,"I might be back on later, depeneding"

11-05-2019T08:13:20,CrimsonQuill,Hullo
11-05-2019T08:13:27,CrimsonQuill,:ptv-greetings:
11-05-2019T08:13:31,CrimsonQuill,I am so happy
11-05-2019T08:13:54,CrimsonQuill,I've finally commited how to solve Laplace Differentiation to memory.
11-05-2019T08:14:16,CrimsonQuill,Now I just have to memorise Non-Linear-Homogeneous equations and I'm ready for my Maths Exam!
11-05-2019T08:14:24,CrimsonQuill,:ptv-excited:
11-05-2019T08:16:44,CrRAR,\o/
11-05-2019T08:16:51,CrimsonQuill,Oh Hello CrRAR
11-05-2019T08:17:17,TerraTheWizard,i understood some of those words
11-05-2019T08:19:01,CrimsonQuill,*facepalm*
11-05-2019T08:19:15,CrimsonQuill,I have GOT to stop throwing about jargon trying to sound smart...
11-05-2019T08:19:21,CrimsonQuill,Sorry Terra
11-05-2019T08:19:45,TerraTheWizard,i just assume it's specific to a certain field
11-05-2019T08:19:49,TerraTheWizard,that i know nothing about
11-05-2019T08:19:51,TerraTheWizard,lol
11-05-2019T08:20:08,CrimsonQuill,"Surveying,"
11-05-2019T08:20:32,CrimsonQuill,Although I myself am baffled as to what the equations have to do with calculating angles in the field and applying corrections.
11-05-2019T08:21:29,CrimsonQuill,\_( '_' )_/
11-05-2019T08:27:31,CrRAR,Trig is good for finding info you don't have about geometry... but beyond that dunno
11-05-2019T08:33:04,CrRAR,B R A I N training
11-05-2019T08:33:26,CrimsonQuill,I was never good at that game

11-05-2019T11:03:49,TerraTheWizard,closing in on 666 sketches
11-05-2019T11:03:51,CrimsonQuill,"Hey, that's Racist!"
11-05-2019T11:03:53,TerraTheWizard,only 7 more to go
11-05-2019T11:04:14,CrimsonQuill,"What's so special about the number 673, Terra?"
11-05-2019T11:04:23,TerraTheWizard,eh?
11-05-2019T11:04:37,CrimsonQuill,"Oh, sorry."
11-05-2019T11:04:45,CrimsonQuill,I thought you were adding 666 to 7.
11-05-2019T11:04:56,CrimsonQuill,Not 659 to 7 to GET 666.
11-05-2019T11:05:12,CrimsonQuill,"Bah, I find the whole ""number of the Beast"" a bit superstitious."
11-05-2019T11:05:26,CrimsonQuill,facepalms self
11-05-2019T11:05:45,TerraTheWizard,well it's a milestone number so /shrug
11-05-2019T11:05:46,CrimsonQuill,Keyboard ran away with me.
11-05-2019T11:06:00,TerraTheWizard,next milestone i guess would be 750
11-05-2019T11:06:01,CrimsonQuill,A milestone for me will be 700 or so...
11-05-2019T11:06:14,CrimsonQuill,But seriously...what year did sketch requests start in?
11-05-2019T11:06:21,TerraTheWizard,2016?
11-05-2019T11:06:24,TerraTheWizard,i think
11-05-2019T11:06:34,CrimsonQuill,And there are almost 700?
11-05-2019T11:06:36,CrimsonQuill,Woah.
11-05-2019T11:06:41,CrimsonQuill,That's...scary.
11-05-2019T11:06:45,CrimsonQuill,But AWESOME.
11-05-2019T11:07:21,TerraTheWizard,nov 2016
11-05-2019T11:07:43,TerraTheWizard,but tom was using the patreon as a sketchblog since 2015
11-05-2019T11:07:43,CrimsonQuill,So...two years and five months.
11-05-2019T11:07:55,TerraTheWizard,so there are some extra stuff waaay back
11-05-2019T11:07:55,CrimsonQuill,"Ok, even longer."
11-05-2019T11:08:13,CrimsonQuill,To think I only came into the fandom at the end of 2017...
11-05-2019T11:08:22,TerraTheWizard,wee babby
11-05-2019T11:08:31,CrimsonQuill,"But I'm glad I came when I did, otherwise i wouldn't see it as I do now."
11-05-2019T11:08:54,CrimsonQuill,"But over the summer, I am going to just draw as much as I like."
11-05-2019T11:08:58,TerraTheWizard,i didn't find out about the patreon until like mid 2017
11-05-2019T11:09:08,TerraTheWizard,it just wasn't ever advertised clearly until then
11-05-2019T11:09:50,CrimsonQuill,The two fandoms into which I am now most involved-Halo and Twokinds-were both discovered in the same year.
11-05-2019T11:10:10,TerraTheWizard,i've been following tk since around august 2009
11-05-2019T11:10:11,CrimsonQuill,"I found Halo 4 in Gamestop and thought, 'Hmm, this might be good'."
11-05-2019T11:10:12,TerraTheWizard,ish
11-05-2019T11:10:49,CrimsonQuill,"I decided to look at Twokinds because my best friend had told me about it in 2016 (I'd even seen one strip but didn't think it was for me), and then just was hooked."
11-05-2019T11:11:14,CrimsonQuill,Having those two fandoms intertwined by Raine being drawn in Halo armour has only added fuel to the fires of fandom.
11-05-2019T11:11:24,CrimsonQuill,:ptv-scratch:
11-05-2019T12:27:10,FloofyCat,Hey all
11-05-2019T12:27:30,CrimsonQuill,Hullo Floofy
11-05-2019T12:32:50,FloofyCat,I got da patreon but I might have been too late making a request
11-05-2019T12:33:12,CrimsonQuill,I made mine Thursday
11-05-2019T12:33:16,CrimsonQuill,Same as usual
11-05-2019T12:33:51,FloofyCat,I got paid late so was late finally getting it.
11-05-2019T12:36:08,IronHorseComics,"well, had to change my request"
11-05-2019T12:36:18,CrimsonQuill,What happened Iron?
11-05-2019T12:37:26,IronHorseComics,"the OC thing, I would have thought the race suit and helmet would have made it vague enough for people to not tell but nope"
11-05-2019T12:37:37,CrimsonQuill,Ummm...
11-05-2019T12:37:42,CrimsonQuill,Race suit?
11-05-2019T12:38:02,IronHorseComics,... the one race car drivers wear
11-05-2019T12:38:30,CrimsonQuill,Oh I see.
11-05-2019T12:39:20,IronHorseComics,"so I resorted to plan B: ""Maeve finds a half-panicked mouse keidran and of thinking over what to do with him"""
11-05-2019T12:39:28,CrimsonQuill,Umm...
11-05-2019T12:39:40,CrimsonQuill,"Never mind, I'm not saying it."
11-05-2019T12:40:05,Mippy,"Hello, gotta work a bit today. I‚Äôll join ya around 5:30 my time"
11-05-2019T12:40:06,CrimsonQuill,It could be like the Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents
11-05-2019T12:40:12,CrimsonQuill,Hello Mippyu
11-05-2019T12:40:29,FloofyCat,There's a whole Rimworld mod of anime-like mouse people.
11-05-2019T12:41:02,IronHorseComics,she could just show him to her mother and ask what to do
11-05-2019T12:41:33,CrimsonQuill,Probably
11-05-2019T12:42:21,IronHorseComics,"or keep him as a secret pet, dress him up in funny doll outfits"
11-05-2019T12:43:01,FloofyCat,Until Kat stumbles across them and then the serious dressing up begins.
11-05-2019T12:45:00,CrimsonQuill,I actually want to try sewing some little dolls like in the sketches over the summer.
11-05-2019T12:46:17,CrimsonQuill,Only...I'm bad at sewing.
11-05-2019T12:49:26,CrimsonQuill,"I mean, I can sew on a button and make a few rudimentary stitches, but otherwise...I'm not what one would call good."
11-05-2019T12:54:01,IronHorseComics,"so as for Kat riding in a dual sea IndyCar, gonna have to do it myself"
11-05-2019T12:54:16,IronHorseComics,and throw in Natani riding in a stock car too
11-05-2019T13:15:03,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:

11-05-2019T15:16:42,GiantBurger,Just popping in to say hi. I‚Äôll be back if the stream is still around when I get my break.
11-05-2019T15:16:49,CrimsonQuill,Hello Giant
11-05-2019T15:16:57,BlazingFoxSpirit,How are yinz?
11-05-2019T15:16:57,CrimsonQuill,I'll save a space
11-05-2019T15:16:58,GiantBurger,Hey Quill
11-05-2019T15:17:00,RandomTonio,"Since only patrons can vote now, there is not much to do"
11-05-2019T15:17:08,RandomTonio,At least we know what the options are
11-05-2019T15:17:12,EdTheFolf,"blegh, too bad i can't stay. see you another day peeps"
11-05-2019T15:17:16,RandomTonio,And we can see the results
11-05-2019T15:17:17,Miftox01,I can`t vote... is it just for paying Patreons?
11-05-2019T15:17:22,BadFoMo,Yep.
11-05-2019T15:17:25,RimaDraws,yea it is
11-05-2019T15:17:29,CrimsonQuill,Sadly yes.
11-05-2019T15:17:30,Miftox01,bummer
11-05-2019T15:17:35,CrimsonQuill,Too many people broke the rules.
11-05-2019T15:17:45,CrimsonQuill,So Tom had to change it.
11-05-2019T15:17:53,sunblaze,hiya
11-05-2019T15:17:56,BadFoMo,I'll be joining that group next month.
11-05-2019T15:17:59,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Sun
11-05-2019T15:18:00,Sclimshady,Hi Sun
11-05-2019T15:18:01,CrimsonQuill,Hello Sunblaze
11-05-2019T15:18:04,RandomTonio,People were voting more than once
11-05-2019T15:18:15,BadFoMo,Bungholes.
11-05-2019T15:18:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Did the vote end already
11-05-2019T15:18:18,16bitPixel,That's too bad.
11-05-2019T15:18:21,IronHorseComics,I'm going for the birb
11-05-2019T15:18:23,Twokinds,"I wonder if amenon can implement a ""popular vote"" where people can still vote, it just won't be applied. Then we could see if there's a difference."
11-05-2019T15:18:32,Sclimshady,7 more minutes Kiwi
11-05-2019T15:18:33,Twokinds,That might be too hard though. I dunno how the voting program works.
11-05-2019T15:18:37,CrimsonQuill,Sounds like it could work Tom...
11-05-2019T15:18:42,FloofyCat,It'd be interesting
11-05-2019T15:18:44,CrimsonQuill,What are the program limitations?
11-05-2019T15:18:44,16bitPixel,It sounds fun
11-05-2019T15:18:47,RandomTonio,I think that would be a good idea
11-05-2019T15:18:48,amenon,"I thought about doing that, but I feel like it'd just be insult to injury xD"
11-05-2019T15:18:50,CrimsonQuill,Could it handle it?
11-05-2019T15:18:51,ProsePro7,Pay to play is still fine with me
11-05-2019T15:18:53,Twokinds,lol
11-05-2019T15:18:54,thestooge2222,"Saw Detective pikachu, it was good!"
11-05-2019T15:18:59,CrimsonQuill,I need to watch that.
11-05-2019T15:19:04,ProsePro7,same
11-05-2019T15:19:04,CrimsonQuill,I saw the trailer.
11-05-2019T15:19:05,16bitPixel,Same
11-05-2019T15:19:06,RimaDraws,pay to play is fine
11-05-2019T15:19:06,Combak,A fair point Amenon.
11-05-2019T15:19:11,Bgrmystr2,"it's only fine for patrons, Prose lol :P"
11-05-2019T15:19:18,Twokinds,"Or perhaps have one BIG vote with all the options that everyone could participate in, that runs the length of the stream :D"
11-05-2019T15:19:24,CrimsonQuill,Ryan Reynolds is brilliant in just the trailer-the whole movie must be really good.
11-05-2019T15:19:26,RandomTonio,I‚Äôm certain that last week‚Äôs winners would not win if it‚Äôs not patrons only
11-05-2019T15:19:30,CrimsonQuill,XD Tom
11-05-2019T15:19:40,Bgrmystr2,lol that would work tom

11-05-2019T15:19:58,SpazztasticKiwi,"Unfortunate we need a gate but if it‚Äôs that or votes that don‚Äôt reflect what‚Äôs actually wanted, oh well"
11-05-2019T15:20:01,BallisticTheWolf,I know twitch has a good voting system for polls I wonder if there is something like that we can use
11-05-2019T15:20:03,Bgrmystr2,but how would you draw if the vote hadn't ended yet?
11-05-2019T15:20:06,RandomTonio,Maybe have the public vote for the last sketch
11-05-2019T15:20:08,Combak,Via a Google Doc or something?
11-05-2019T15:20:11,Twokinds,"I mean, I'm still really interested to see how suggestions end up ranked if they're all matched with all the other ones."
11-05-2019T15:20:32,FloofyCat,"Google survey would probably work, or strawpoll."
11-05-2019T15:20:37,RimaDraws,it is interesting to say the least
11-05-2019T15:20:38,RandomTonio,I‚Äôm certain that last week‚Äôs winners will be really different if it was not patrons only
11-05-2019T15:20:43,krispyk,Strawpoll is super easy
11-05-2019T15:20:47,FloofyCat,There would be a cheating problem but its not like it'd matter
11-05-2019T15:20:50,CrimsonQuill,What's strawpoll?
11-05-2019T15:20:57,Combak,A website
11-05-2019T15:21:02,TeapotOfDoom,a simple website for polls
11-05-2019T15:21:02,FloofyCat,You just put poll options and link an online poll.
11-05-2019T15:21:05,CrimsonQuill,Umm...ok.
11-05-2019T15:21:07,ProsePro7,The system that you have is the only way that you are going to be able to keep people from cheating
11-05-2019T15:21:07,amenon,I'm going to be ginning up a feasibility test for mass-poll insanity
11-05-2019T15:21:09,BadFoMo,When do you plan to implment this 'big vote' thing?
11-05-2019T15:21:12,FloofyCat,It's very quick and easy
11-05-2019T15:21:23,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúBoob-b-gone‚Äù
11-05-2019T15:21:33,MarvTheHugPharaoh,my number one 1
11-05-2019T15:21:34,CrimsonQuill,@Amenon how hard does your program have to work for the polls and things?
11-05-2019T15:21:38,Combak,"It's at the ""Who knows"" point ATM."
11-05-2019T15:21:39,amenon,But I'm pretty sure making people vote for 70-80 options is against the Geneva convention
11-05-2019T15:21:39,thestooge2222,boobie b gone
11-05-2019T15:21:42,krispyk,I know who suggested the boob b gone lol

11-05-2019T15:22:33,CrimsonQuill,"BTW Guys, ever heard of a pointcloud?"
11-05-2019T15:22:41,BadFoMo,I'm guessing bots.
11-05-2019T15:22:45,Combak,I think so...
11-05-2019T15:22:50,CrimsonQuill,I just really want to yammer to some people about them.
11-05-2019T15:22:54,CrimsonQuill,Please forgive me.
11-05-2019T15:23:02,Bgrmystr2,"it was just people voting multiple times with multiple IPs for the same thing, bots or not. @Corpsly"

11-05-2019T15:30:47,thestooge2222,"what will Nat be singing? the titanic song? ""ashes"" from deadpool"" ?"

11-05-2019T15:31:11,CrimsonQuill,That's probably got so many grammar mistakes.
11-05-2019T15:31:26,Twokinds,Well you've got all stream so no pressure
11-05-2019T15:31:28,Combak,Process of elimination Tonio.
11-05-2019T15:31:34,BadFoMo,@Dadrobit Yep. All the Wolves were holing.
11-05-2019T15:31:36,CrimsonQuill,Why do I even star putting in Irish anyway? I don't have an Irish accent.
11-05-2019T15:31:36,Sclimshady,"will it tell me once i hit 7, because ive lost count"

11-05-2019T15:32:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Little nibbly in the back ground in that was adorable
11-05-2019T15:32:28,BadFoMo,@RandomTonio That's my complant about this.
11-05-2019T15:32:44,CrimsonQuill,I think that polls are better overall.
11-05-2019T15:32:55,CrimsonQuill,A single mega poll...is too confusing.
11-05-2019T15:33:03,CrimsonQuill,"But thank you Tom, for the test trial!"
11-05-2019T15:33:06,16bitPixel,Yeah
11-05-2019T15:33:06,Bgrmystr2,"no it ain't, @16bitPixel"
11-05-2019T15:33:29,autoenigma,i hope one of the cat maren wins

11-05-2019T15:34:25,Twokinds,I don't know how to draw someone singing XD
11-05-2019T15:34:31,Dadrobit,"The megapoll was interesting though, that'll be fun to see how it compares to the final results."
11-05-2019T15:34:42,Combak,To Google for reference Tom!
11-05-2019T15:34:45,Bgrmystr2,not a fan myself. Goes against the concept from the getgo.
11-05-2019T15:34:54,FloofyCat,I'd be for a mega poll trial since it doesn't have certain suggestions essentially suppressed because there's a big trendy one in a round if that makes sense
11-05-2019T15:34:56,Sclimshady,"I dont know how to draw, so you're good Tom"
11-05-2019T15:34:58,Dadrobit,Do it in a karaoke bar?
11-05-2019T15:35:00,Bgrmystr2,but yeah this massive google vote thing is interesting
11-05-2019T15:35:03,Therarefoxy,Best song ever
11-05-2019T15:35:04,FloofyCat,Yeah I was wondering how you could draw singing too
11-05-2019T15:35:06,SpazztasticKiwi,How about that opera song thing from greatest showman
11-05-2019T15:35:08,InTheLionsDen,Too bad it wasn't Natani and Reni singing. Contrasting quality.

11-05-2019T15:35:27,Dadrobit,Don't Stop Believing probably
11-05-2019T15:35:27,BadFoMo,Why don't we just scrap the whole polls thing and just go with all Tom picks?
11-05-2019T15:35:31,FloofyCat,"Natani: ""Spooky scary skele... skeletons..?"""

11-05-2019T15:36:16,FloofyCat,I just realised
11-05-2019T15:36:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Some singing can be without much mouth movement
11-05-2019T15:36:26,FloofyCat,Tom has a better voting system than my country's national voting system :(
11-05-2019T15:36:28,Twokinds,A hairbrush mic doesn't really make a lot of sense in a world without mics XD
11-05-2019T15:36:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Or opening

11-05-2019T15:36:54,ColonelFox,I might need to leave the stream. My power is acting funny
11-05-2019T15:36:57,Bgrmystr2,you could make some magic stick thing that acts like a mic
11-05-2019T15:37:01,CrimsonQuill,It's not a mike though.

11-05-2019T15:53:18,NeonMitsumi,lmao Floofy
11-05-2019T15:53:23,CrimsonQuill,Permission to link a musical piece by the band Trocadero guys?
11-05-2019T15:53:25,Katfeathers,I'm on Firefox mobile
11-05-2019T15:53:28,amenon,Can someone who it doesn't work for see if there's something in the javascript console output?
11-05-2019T15:53:29,CrimsonQuill,Just thought it's really good.
11-05-2019T15:53:42,CrimsonQuill,@amenon it worked for me
11-05-2019T15:53:45,fanir,"@amenon, my adblockers etc. don't say they blocked anything, closing the real poll didn't help. i'm on chrome 74.0.3729.131 on win7"
11-05-2019T15:53:47,Dadrobit,"Working here in Firefox, just finished."
11-05-2019T15:53:57,amenon,How the hellll did you finish that fast xD
11-05-2019T15:54:11,Dadrobit,I only voted for  17
11-05-2019T15:54:12,RimaDraws,i wont finish it
11-05-2019T15:54:30,Dadrobit,I tend to not even bothering for the ones I'm not terribly interested in.
11-05-2019T15:54:39,fanir,"@amenon, there we go: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property 'checked' of null at window.onload (demo:704)"
11-05-2019T15:54:42,Combak,"Amenon, how should I get to that?"
11-05-2019T15:54:43,RimaDraws,mine is diff this time.
11-05-2019T15:54:58,CrimsonQuill,I still thin that the round based polls makes it easier....
11-05-2019T15:55:01,Dimensional,Darn. Nobody recognizes my suggestion of Captain Planet. XP
11-05-2019T15:55:07,CrimsonQuill,It's just that there are so many!
11-05-2019T15:55:11,CrimsonQuill,So many to choose!
11-05-2019T15:55:21,Combak,"No, we get it. It's just a lot of work and not that great."
11-05-2019T15:55:22,amenon,"Someone who it doesn't work for, please refresh"
11-05-2019T15:55:31,amenon,@fanir
11-05-2019T15:55:32,Combak,It works!
11-05-2019T15:55:45,fanir,looks fine now \o/
11-05-2019T15:55:46,InTheLionsDen,Working now.
11-05-2019T15:55:52,Combak,Thank you Amenon!
11-05-2019T15:56:05,Bgrmystr2,"yup, that fixed it"
11-05-2019T15:56:06,Katfeathers,"Refreshed, and still the standby page"
11-05-2019T15:56:26,Bgrmystr2,"kat, it's not for the normal vote, it's for the demo page"
11-05-2019T15:56:32,amenon,"But yeah, if you're voting in Tom's google forms poll, please use that to see if it makes voting easier"
11-05-2019T15:56:38,amenon,And that link again: https://tkpolls.com/demo
11-05-2019T15:57:15,Dadrobit,"Whoa, just tried the ballot helper. Not sure what the purpose is?"
11-05-2019T15:57:24,RimaDraws,i will give it a try again. tho i don't like ballot helper because i think that is a absolute waste of time
11-05-2019T15:57:43,RimaDraws,i can find the suggestions so much easier without that confusion
11-05-2019T15:58:38,Bgrmystr2,"I'll have to look at this in a bit, I've gotta get something to eat."
11-05-2019T15:59:02,CrimsonQuill,Ok bgr
11-05-2019T15:59:08,sunblaze,somehow I can double and tripple and more vote with the ballot then with just shoving winwows right and left. quite confusing
11-05-2019T15:59:14,amenon,"Yeah, I don't know how many people it'd be helpful for or not"
11-05-2019T15:59:14,kiabugboy,i'm seeing some old forumite names here
11-05-2019T15:59:22,amenon,Hey kia o/

11-05-2019T15:59:36,RimaDraws,also how goes the writing amenon?
11-05-2019T15:59:41,amenon,But the idea with the ballot helper tech is to have an alternative way to fill out a ballot
11-05-2019T15:59:52,kiabugboy,sup dadrobit
11-05-2019T16:00:02,amenon,"Have not written a word this year, thankfully xD"

11-05-2019T16:12:54,GiantBurger,Actually getting a male ref sheet? What alternate dimension did I fall into

11-05-2019T16:14:16,Sclimshady,Screen cap the stream recording?
11-05-2019T16:14:26,CrimsonQuill,Keith is my sister's favourite character.
11-05-2019T16:14:33,Bgrmystr2,you can use literally any real reference sheet as a reference.
11-05-2019T16:14:37,Vexd,We've seen Keith's Butt more than anyone else in the cast. We need some Zen Butt
11-05-2019T16:14:44,GiantBurger,"Keith should be everyone‚Äôs favorite, Quill"
11-05-2019T16:14:46,amenon,Reposting so they're in the same place:
11-05-2019T16:14:53,amenon,Tom's poll: https://forms.gle/znj7reaBPcSBRQxF6
11-05-2019T16:15:11,amenon,Ballot Helper that may or may not be helpful in choosing what to vote for in Tom's poll: https://tkpolls.com/demo
11-05-2019T16:15:11,CrimsonQuill,"No, we need Keith in Halo armour to join Raine and Red as part of the fireteam."
11-05-2019T16:15:30,CrimsonQuill,Because Bailey's the only character I've come up with who has any sort of depth.
11-05-2019T16:16:01,CrimsonQuill,"Or Freelancer armour, which is the same in appearence but much weaker"
11-05-2019T16:16:21,FloofyCat,Keith is gunna have a grumpy sheet.
11-05-2019T16:16:28,CrimsonQuill,Keith is Church.
11-05-2019T16:16:37,amenon,Looks pretty chill actually
11-05-2019T16:16:47,CrimsonQuill,He hates everything...but he hates his friends the least.
11-05-2019T16:16:59,Dadrobit,He looks like his mind is elsewhere.
11-05-2019T16:17:04,CrimsonQuill,"Or at least, that's how he started"
11-05-2019T16:17:05,Sclimshady,Mood Quill
11-05-2019T16:17:10,amenon,Chiller than when posing for a statue at least xD

11-05-2019T16:18:20,InTheLionsDen,Just doing some experimentation as well.
11-05-2019T16:18:40,SamuelLeumas,"Oh misread, sorry. I just woke up"

11-05-2019T16:21:51,Bgrmystr2,goddamnit.:ptv-unimpressed: this is why we always lose capture the flag.
11-05-2019T16:21:54,Snowdayzz,How do i play capture the flag -_-
11-05-2019T16:22:18,Bgrmystr2,easy snow. Read title as action. Do that action.

11-05-2019T16:22:32,Snowdayzz,Heh

11-05-2019T16:24:41,CrimsonQuill,But I justneeded a quick snack
11-05-2019T16:24:58,BluePhantom90,"yeah Tom the other poll idea is a lot nicer. You pick the 7 you want or like and thats it, the pics of yours is out of the full list and just not out of multiple list"
11-05-2019T16:24:58,Bgrmystr2,Quill we need the flag back btw
11-05-2019T16:25:16,CrimsonQuill,Oh...ok. I'll give it to Tex.
11-05-2019T16:25:28,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-confused: uh. okay
11-05-2019T16:25:44,MrEase,"that poll isn't the real poll, amenon is just doing a comparison poll"
11-05-2019T16:25:44,CrimsonQuill,As long as I don't get Grenaded to the head first. XD
11-05-2019T16:26:08,MrEase,to see the difference between the patreon vote and a public vote in the chat
11-05-2019T16:26:49,9000Kitsune,"o, is there a public vote?"
11-05-2019T16:26:53,horoisawolf,the ballot helper I find actually helpful especially for long lists.
11-05-2019T16:27:05,CrimsonQuill,I like how this is turning out so far.
11-05-2019T16:27:13,TeapotOfDoom,If you hand over the flag nobody will granade you
11-05-2019T16:27:35,Combak,"... Ack, geeze. You really need to just say ""No"" to some stuff on the demo thing or else it takes forever to get through."
11-05-2019T16:27:42,horoisawolf,"the google form, uh, just 7 out of so many things i'd like to see - this is going to be hard to decide"
11-05-2019T16:27:43,amenon,"You really do, yeah xD"
11-05-2019T16:27:44,CrimsonQuill,Wait...what's that hissing sound next to my head?
11-05-2019T16:27:52,CrimsonQuill,Is there something on my helmet?
11-05-2019T16:27:57,CrimsonQuill,It could be dangerous!

11-05-2019T16:28:20,amenon,"I think straight approval voting might be the simplest way to do a poll form like that. No limit on how many, just how ever many you want."

11-05-2019T16:28:40,RimaDraws,i just like this way of voting more so than the poll voting
11-05-2019T16:28:41,TeapotOfDoom,perfect teamwork on that one xD

11-05-2019T16:28:53,BadFoMo,@horoisawolf That's why I like amenon's poll over the Google poll.

11-05-2019T16:29:24,Combak,"Thanks Quill, Marv, Snow Day, Foxx, FoMo, Bgr."
11-05-2019T16:29:28,MrEase,"amenon, are there certain users that are still patreons but are unable to vote for whatever reason? Is there a blacklist, cause some people are claiming there was"
11-05-2019T16:29:39,Snowdayzz,"Just snow will do, but bye!"
11-05-2019T16:30:16,BadFoMo,I can't just pick 7 (there are 25 things on the other poll for crying out loud!).
11-05-2019T16:30:26,Snowdayzz,Though.. never experienced snow before
11-05-2019T16:30:41,ReeseWolf,given the choices dont really matter its not hard to pick 7
11-05-2019T16:31:24,BadFoMo,"For just this one, or all future polls?"
11-05-2019T16:31:36,Bgrmystr2,"alright, I think I'm happy with the 7 I wanted on tom's poll lol"
11-05-2019T16:31:50,amenon,@MrEase Do you know if they were talking about the IP blacklist or not being on the list of voters?
11-05-2019T16:32:18,Bgrmystr2,"well, you have to presume tom would draw them, otherwise there's no point participating in the test Reese"
11-05-2019T16:32:25,Bgrmystr2,kinda the point
11-05-2019T16:32:43,MrEase,I think they were saying that they weren't allowed to vote despite being patreons

11-05-2019T16:34:04,Bgrmystr2,hey Ten
11-05-2019T16:34:06,TeapotOfDoom,Hi Ten
11-05-2019T16:34:13,Bgrmystr2,changed your name? :o
11-05-2019T16:34:26,Tenux,Me?
11-05-2019T16:34:36,Bgrmystr2,yeah
11-05-2019T16:34:45,MrEase,"maybe authentification failed, or for some reason the whitelist from making suggestions affected their ability to vote, if they had won in the previous weeks"
11-05-2019T16:35:01,amenon,"That side of it is up to Tom, but *as far as I know* every patron of his is allowed to vote at the moment. I guess there could be something if payment processing was wonky or whatever?"
11-05-2019T16:35:46,Tenux,No. Ive always been Tenux. Prob thinking of someone else mystr
11-05-2019T16:36:02,Bgrmystr2,"hmm, okay."
11-05-2019T16:36:04,horoisawolf,"but overall i like the idea of having one big poll at the beginning or bevore the stream starts instead of having multiple polls through the stream (because timezones: the stream runs relly late for eurepeans, cant stay up till end if working on monday)"
11-05-2019T16:36:29,horoisawolf,*europeans
11-05-2019T16:36:37,MrEase,"anyway, is this just a temporary measure, to stop LauraAnon from hacking till you find something more secure, or is this permanent"
11-05-2019T16:36:48,Bgrmystr2,"biggest problem with single poll is that if it ends at the end of the stream, it's not complete for tom to draw what's voted on, @Horo"
11-05-2019T16:36:59,BadFoMo,This is a temp thing?!
11-05-2019T16:37:01,Bgrmystr2,so.. it kind of ruins the purpose
11-05-2019T16:37:10,BluePhantom90,yeah I think the 1 big poll is better then like 5-6polls
11-05-2019T16:37:12,MrEase,no I'm asking FoMo
11-05-2019T16:37:16,MrEase,not saying
11-05-2019T16:37:19,ReeseWolf,the only downside to one large poll is people who work sunday and cant be here right when stream starts would be left out
11-05-2019T16:37:21,BadFoMo,Oh.
11-05-2019T16:37:26,amenon,An omnipoll would presumably be run before the stream
11-05-2019T16:37:49,amenon,"And it would also presumably be restricted to patrons, because that's the only way to stop something like that from being stuffed"
11-05-2019T16:37:54,Bgrmystr2,haha that's a nice name
11-05-2019T16:38:12,MrEase,"Actually an Omni poll would be a really good idea, because at 4:30, its a good time for both US and EU"
11-05-2019T16:38:18,amenon,"So @MrEase to answer your question, I personally think being Patron-only is unavoidable at this point"
11-05-2019T16:38:43,Bgrmystr2,"also, how do you know that the people who rig the polls aren't also patrons? It's only $1"
11-05-2019T16:38:44,MrEase,Half Easter lol
11-05-2019T16:38:52,Bgrmystr2,it's not going to prevent anything if they want it enough

11-05-2019T16:42:43,FloofyCat,Only 19?
11-05-2019T16:42:45,amenon,And as @Dadrobit said; putting in suggestions costs money. There's no reason why voting should (or should not) be free.
11-05-2019T16:42:47,FloofyCat,Darn that's young.
11-05-2019T16:43:07,amenon,"It was free because that was what Tom wanted, but... Internet gonna Internet"
11-05-2019T16:43:13,MrEase,"so that the entire community can be involved, instead of just a small portion"

11-05-2019T16:46:31,Bgrmystr2,"because paying to suggest something, something that could have been a commission before tom did patreon, is VERY different from simply voting on what you like."

11-05-2019T21:14:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Did you guys know there‚Äôs a company that thought it was a good idea to name their prune snacks ‚Äúthick and easy‚Äù
11-05-2019T21:14:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Because I‚Äôve found out we sell it
11-05-2019T21:15:06,FloofyTK,really lol

11-05-2019T21:15:45,CrRAR,oh dear
11-05-2019T21:15:47,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve been considering taking in more fruits and stuff. Things higher in potassium and such
11-05-2019T21:15:55,CrRAR,Award winning marketing folks there xD
11-05-2019T21:16:02,SpazztasticKiwi,For my energy levels since it seems to be lacking

11-05-2019T21:16:13,FloofyTK,lol
11-05-2019T21:16:19,SpazztasticKiwi,And I came across that. Not sure I want prunes now
11-05-2019T21:16:37,CrRAR,Bananas re rich in potassium!
11-05-2019T21:16:42,CrRAR,*are
11-05-2019T21:16:56,CrRAR,as is Kazakhstan!
11-05-2019T21:17:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah. But daily amount would take four or somethin bananas to reach
11-05-2019T21:17:05,CrRAR,very high grade potassium!
11-05-2019T21:17:15,CrRAR,yeah
11-05-2019T21:17:44,SpazztasticKiwi,I do like apples. Got a bag for by my bed at night. That‚Äôs helped for night snacking
11-05-2019T21:17:48,CrRAR,Coconut water has lots too... but it's expensive.
11-05-2019T21:17:54,FenceEqualizer,As long as you mix it with other foods throught the day that has potassium you should be golden
11-05-2019T21:18:01,FenceEqualizer,Don't have to force four at once.
11-05-2019T21:18:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm not sure on coconut water. I‚Äôve had coconut milk from a coconut but nothing past that
11-05-2019T21:18:50,FloofyCat,Not really a fan of coconuts
11-05-2019T21:19:07,FloofyCat,You can bonk people with them?

11-05-2019T21:19:20,FloofyCat,:(
11-05-2019T21:19:23,CrRAR,The milk is highly fatty. The water tastes a little funny but is sugary. Lots of brands out there taste wired though.
11-05-2019T21:19:33,CrRAR,*weird
11-05-2019T21:20:10,CrRAR,A fresh coconut water is described to taste a bit like strawberries.

11-05-2019T23:49:12,Dadrobit,"Also, the trash threads are hysterical. ""A second ref sheet in one day! This is what happens when only Patreons can vote!"" Public vote proceeds to be 5/7 ref sheets. ""I don't trust this public vote to be accurate!"""

11-05-2019T23:53:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Has anything like that been done
11-05-2019T23:54:21,Dadrobit,"By the by, Pokemon movie was pretty solid if anyone's interested. The human leads were a bit meh, too much overacting. But Ryan Reynolds was on point and it was otherwise a very solid movie."

11-05-2019T23:55:52,SpazztasticKiwi,"He went to Japan, ran into Ryan Reynolds at the premiere or something and he‚Äôs hyped"

11-05-2019T23:58:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I got a few cards. Found them in a grab bag with some other stuff I was actually wanting
