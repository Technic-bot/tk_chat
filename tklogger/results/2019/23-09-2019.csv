23-09-2019T09:06:56,AspiringNoodle,"Mainly, it was the fact that a pretorn ticket was there and it was bugging the everliving hell out of me xD"
23-09-2019T09:25:13,Dadrobit,National Problem Gambling Helpline Network (1-800-522-4700)
23-09-2019T09:25:18,Dadrobit,No joke.
23-09-2019T09:29:40,AspiringNoodle,I don't thhink I'm that far down the rabbit hole
23-09-2019T09:33:07,Dadrobit,"You just spent the better part of 3 hours wages on 30 seconds of gambling and ""feel better now"" and you're so easily swayed to gamble that just looking at the tickets compels you. Yes. That is a problem."
23-09-2019T09:36:13,AspiringNoodle,We'll see.  <3
23-09-2019T09:41:24,AspiringNoodle,"...*siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiigh*, my father :/"
23-09-2019T09:42:18,AspiringNoodle,"Go out to eat last night at Bob Evans, buys a whole pie to bring home"
23-09-2019T09:42:34,AspiringNoodle,"It's only 10:40 the following day, and he's already planning on finishing the pie"
23-09-2019T09:42:53,AspiringNoodle,Like.... this is why you're obese and have T2 diabetes >_<
23-09-2019T09:43:31,TerraTheWizard,what kind of pie?
23-09-2019T09:44:39,AspiringNoodle,I think it's a strawberry cream pie?
23-09-2019T09:48:59,AspiringNoodle,"Can confirm, also dad has officially eaten a whole pie in less than 24 hours"
23-09-2019T09:49:07,AspiringNoodle,*facepalm*
23-09-2019T16:21:25,SpazztasticKiwi,what‚Äôs a nice gentle cleaner for car insides
23-09-2019T16:30:55,TeapotOfDoom,is this a serious question?
23-09-2019T16:31:19,TeapotOfDoom,Cause i don't think you'll get a serious answer out of me
23-09-2019T16:34:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I need something that‚Äôs not highly perfumed or chemical based
23-09-2019T16:34:53,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm cleaning out a car that‚Äôs not mine & the lady owner is my friend - strong stuff is not her friend
23-09-2019T16:36:47,TeapotOfDoom,hm
23-09-2019T16:37:10,TeapotOfDoom,neither do i own a car nor would i know stuff to clean it that fits these criteria
23-09-2019T16:37:38,TeapotOfDoom,maybe some wipes that are enriched with cleaner?
23-09-2019T16:37:42,tehbear,dish soap?
23-09-2019T16:37:49,TeapotOfDoom,dish soap!
23-09-2019T16:37:50,CrRAR,Like ArmorAll wipes.
23-09-2019T16:38:06,TeapotOfDoom,ah so that stuff does exist over there ^^
23-09-2019T16:38:38,SpazztasticKiwi,the armor all wipes crack your upholstery if you don‚Äôt keep using it
23-09-2019T16:39:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I found a gentle kitchen cleaner that should do
23-09-2019T16:39:24,CrRAR,I don't use on upholstery.
23-09-2019T16:39:28,CrRAR,Nice
23-09-2019T16:39:47,CrRAR,Is it citrus-y?
23-09-2019T16:39:56,CrRAR,:tangerine:
23-09-2019T16:40:10,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs not unscented but it‚Äôs not ‚Äúknock you on your ass citrus‚Äù
23-09-2019T16:41:14,CrRAR,"While that sounds tempting, I prefer reenergize-your-soul citrus scent."

23-09-2019T16:42:24,CrRAR,:tangerine:
23-09-2019T16:42:49,TeapotOfDoom,CITRUS FOR DAYS scented
23-09-2019T17:24:12,SpazztasticKiwi,it already looks so much better
23-09-2019T17:25:17,TeapotOfDoom,I'm currently looking at a vector graphic i'm doing for fun and i take that as a compliment thank you
23-09-2019T17:26:25,SpazztasticKiwi,so starved for compliments you look for them out of context
23-09-2019T17:26:42,TeapotOfDoom,it just came it at perfectly the right moment
23-09-2019T17:27:05,SomeNiceUser,Hai guys
23-09-2019T17:27:10,TeapotOfDoom,"i was just thinkin ""yeah i really got something done today"""

23-09-2019T17:28:49,SomeNiceUser,"I have no idea what that is, so I‚Äôm gonna search it up."
23-09-2019T17:29:34,TeapotOfDoom,vector graphics?
23-09-2019T17:29:39,SomeNiceUser,"Ok, now I understand."

23-09-2019T17:31:09,TeapotOfDoom,Yup i'm nt that good at drawing so i usually do vector stuff
23-09-2019T17:31:38,SomeNiceUser,"It‚Äôs practice, I guess."
23-09-2019T17:31:43,TeapotOfDoom,yes
23-09-2019T17:32:10,TeapotOfDoom,and honestly i don't have enough time to also practice drawing
23-09-2019T17:33:14,SomeNiceUser,"Doodles are fun to do, just need a few seconds to make a doggo."
23-09-2019T17:33:47,SomeNiceUser,A low effort doggo.
23-09-2019T17:34:25,SomeNiceUser,"Also I‚Äôm learning how to use Blender, I took a liking from what CGI can do."
23-09-2019T17:35:26,TeapotOfDoom,search for cgmatter on youtube
23-09-2019T17:36:35,SomeNiceUser,I‚Äôm gonna write that down for later. That seems interesting.
23-09-2019T17:38:03,SomeNiceUser,"When something peaks my interest, I get plenty of ideas."
23-09-2019T17:39:09,SomeNiceUser,"And I guess next stream will be on Friday, yes?"
23-09-2019T17:39:26,TeapotOfDoom,i do think so
23-09-2019T17:39:42,TeapotOfDoom,damn got hooked again and now i'm finishing the thing

23-09-2019T17:41:10,SomeNiceUser,Insomnia ftw lol
23-09-2019T17:43:06,SomeNiceUser,"Also, it‚Äôs probably wise to sleep, but if you stay awake all night, a few coffees would help plenty."
23-09-2019T17:43:50,TeapotOfDoom,I don't drink coffee
23-09-2019T17:43:58,TeapotOfDoom,kinda don't like the taste
23-09-2019T17:44:47,SomeNiceUser,"If I need coffee, I would chug it down as fast as possible."
23-09-2019T17:44:59,TeapotOfDoom,i think I'm done
23-09-2019T17:45:01,TeapotOfDoom,nice
23-09-2019T17:45:29,SomeNiceUser,I‚Äôm curious about how it looks.
23-09-2019T17:46:23,SpazztasticKiwi,my imagination gave me a spoop last night
23-09-2019T17:46:52,SpazztasticKiwi,dreamed my friend came back from her honeymoon pregnant
23-09-2019T17:47:05,SomeNiceUser,Oh no.
23-09-2019T17:47:25,SomeNiceUser,Sudden pregnancy.
23-09-2019T17:47:41,TeapotOfDoom,Suddenly: tails
23-09-2019T17:48:10,SomeNiceUser,I thought about a twist about that.
23-09-2019T17:48:18,SpazztasticKiwi,maybe they‚Äôll try sometime but far as I know it‚Äôs up in the air whether she CAN have kids rn or not
23-09-2019T17:48:24,SomeNiceUser,Suddenly: boobs
23-09-2019T17:49:06,SpazztasticKiwi,and they‚Äôre wanting to settle getting a house and the other good stuff
23-09-2019T17:49:47,SpazztasticKiwi,if she were tho I just hope she‚Äôs ok with it and it goes over good
23-09-2019T17:53:58,TeapotOfDoom,anyway it is time for me to go

23-09-2019T22:20:59,AspiringNoodle,"Like, it was murdered"
23-09-2019T22:21:01,AspiringNoodle,It was revived
23-09-2019T22:21:04,AspiringNoodle,Then I killed it again
23-09-2019T23:45:13,SpazztasticKiwi,disadvantage to having black cat: when you kick out your foot into a shadow on the bed and that shadow turns out to be alive
