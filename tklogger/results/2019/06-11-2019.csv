06-11-2019T13:01:11,TeapotOfDoom,I just wanted to see the animation they talked about yesterday. found out that 3 digits from the link are missing
06-11-2019T13:01:36,TeapotOfDoom,also something in their servername is missing
06-11-2019T13:02:33,TeapotOfDoom,there are 1000 different links that could be it (if i guess the missing letter in the servername right)
06-11-2019T13:02:50,TeapotOfDoom,looks like i won't see it
06-11-2019T13:04:47,TeapotOfDoom,well ima try anyway
06-11-2019T13:05:05,TeapotOfDoom,lets see if firefox will survive opening 1000 tabs at once lol
06-11-2019T13:13:28,TeapotOfDoom,it does and I have not found it

06-11-2019T14:20:59,ThingsAreMoving,not sure if it's a pogo stick or a jackhammer

06-11-2019T15:55:20,SpazztasticKiwi,is it fish butt or fish tail
06-11-2019T15:55:25,SpazztasticKiwi,or fisch
06-11-2019T15:56:54,ThingsAreMoving,"Jackhammer, maybe not. But surely some would be keen to test out a pogohammer, eh?"
06-11-2019T16:04:17,SpazztasticKiwi,thats basically gonna be a pogostick with a hammer in the end
06-11-2019T16:04:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"would you like to try balancing on that, let alone jumping around"
06-11-2019T16:05:19,SpazztasticKiwi,one wrong move and you’ll have a pogohammer in the jaw
06-11-2019T16:10:02,ThingsAreMoving,"balancing is easy since you're supposed to hop around, the biggest problem would be to hold your grip properly"
06-11-2019T16:11:15,ThingsAreMoving,"but yeah, there's probably a reason why we don't have toys/power tool crossovers"
06-11-2019T16:11:56,SpazztasticKiwi,“hold my beer”

06-11-2019T16:28:37,TeapotOfDoom,Damnit w0lf i had my firefox open 1k tabs several times and i did not manage to hit the right combination
06-11-2019T16:29:09,TeapotOfDoom,I mostly did this to see if I could find it. Yet it still seems satisfying to get it in the end
06-11-2019T16:29:48,TeapotOfDoom,And seeing it I think it was definitly worth it xD
06-11-2019T16:36:39,TeapotOfDoom,Also thx for sending it xD
06-11-2019T16:45:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I give up
06-11-2019T16:45:26,SpazztasticKiwi,what are you talking about
06-11-2019T16:45:33,TeapotOfDoom,hiya spazz whaddup
06-11-2019T16:45:58,TeapotOfDoom,you mean the firefox stuff?

06-11-2019T16:46:15,TeapotOfDoom,oh taxes are fun

06-11-2019T16:50:49,TeapotOfDoom,w0lfy sent an animation in chat yesterday and toms sream catpured part of it. so i tried to reconstruct it. i tortured my firefox into opening 1k tabs at once to try all variations
06-11-2019T16:51:01,TeapotOfDoom,of the link
06-11-2019T16:51:24,TeapotOfDoom,didn't find it tho. w0lfy was kind enough to send it again ^^

06-11-2019T16:53:17,TeapotOfDoom,the 230
06-11-2019T16:54:41,SpazztasticKiwi,that’s not loading
06-11-2019T16:55:27,TeapotOfDoom,i split it it's not valid
06-11-2019T16:55:54,TeapotOfDoom,i just wanted to show what i was hunting
06-11-2019T16:56:00,SpazztasticKiwi,no need to cry over spilled links
06-11-2019T16:57:19,TeapotOfDoom,well another one of those things i can add to the list of stuff i do to get my mind of my exams lol
06-11-2019T16:59:04,SpazztasticKiwi,dO yOuR wOrK
06-11-2019T16:59:41,TeapotOfDoom,iT's 11 pM aNd I StaRtEd aT 8am
06-11-2019T17:00:15,SpazztasticKiwi,to bad no excuses
06-11-2019T17:00:22,TeapotOfDoom,and for the protocol i am indeed still learning
06-11-2019T17:00:23,SpazztasticKiwi,you no stop till you doctor
06-11-2019T17:00:57,TeapotOfDoom,lol that's the most accurate translation for Ich schlag dich Krankenhaus
06-11-2019T17:01:16,TeapotOfDoom,How's your German coming?
06-11-2019T17:01:26,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t see an advantage to working 8 to 11
06-11-2019T17:01:31,SpazztasticKiwi,that’s over 12 hours
06-11-2019T17:01:41,SpazztasticKiwi,no way you actually learned the whole time
06-11-2019T17:01:50,TeapotOfDoom,i know. well that's just me trying to get my engineering degree
06-11-2019T17:02:00,TeapotOfDoom,did different stuff with breaks
06-11-2019T17:02:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"duolingo has a thing that as you progress, older lessons “decay” so you have to keep refreshing on them now and then"
06-11-2019T17:02:42,SpazztasticKiwi,so my progress has to do backtracking often so I don’t loose progress
06-11-2019T17:02:55,SpazztasticKiwi,"smart, isn’t it?"
06-11-2019T17:03:01,TeapotOfDoom,"but yeah went to uni for a lesson at 8, went home, studied, did homework at 2 to about 5 or so and now started studying again"
06-11-2019T17:03:42,TeapotOfDoom,it is. i started learning chinese (which i prolly should do again...) and you really tend to forget stuff
06-11-2019T17:04:27,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s useless if you’re forced to have to redo things you’ve learned or be regressed back a level
06-11-2019T17:04:41,TeapotOfDoom,makes sense if you know it
06-11-2019T17:05:10,SpazztasticKiwi,and what use is it if it’s the same exercises?
06-11-2019T17:05:23,SpazztasticKiwi,what are you learning but memorization
06-11-2019T17:05:37,TeapotOfDoom,what's the most advanced thing you manage to say atm? just curious
06-11-2019T17:06:23,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve gotten better help from watching fruits basket - it has a German character who uses the off hand phrase
06-11-2019T17:06:54,SpazztasticKiwi,"and with what I’ve learned and filling in the blanks, I can get what he’s saying"
06-11-2019T17:07:13,TeapotOfDoom,i remember you mentioning that at some point
06-11-2019T17:08:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m still terrible at spelling some
06-11-2019T17:08:08,TeapotOfDoom,do it
06-11-2019T17:08:28,SpazztasticKiwi,but half of that’s got to do with autocorrect trying to Englishfy the words
06-11-2019T17:08:57,SpazztasticKiwi,"ende gut, alles gut"
06-11-2019T17:09:03,TeapotOfDoom,nice
06-11-2019T17:09:39,TeapotOfDoom,well that's a classic. i have all my stuff set to english so me typing german dialect makes my autocorrect scream in agony xD
06-11-2019T17:09:54,SpazztasticKiwi,"some of the stuff though, much like duolingo in general, I’m suspicious of"
06-11-2019T17:10:13,SpazztasticKiwi,the app itself says it learns from users for translations
06-11-2019T17:11:11,SpazztasticKiwi,some German is longer than what you say in English and some English can be summed up with like two German words
06-11-2019T17:11:42,TeapotOfDoom,indeed. i love it when german words get imported and then just butchered
06-11-2019T17:11:50,TeapotOfDoom,Wanderlust
06-11-2019T17:11:54,SpazztasticKiwi,"deutsche sprache, schwere sprache"
06-11-2019T17:12:01,TeapotOfDoom,hahhahaha
06-11-2019T17:12:03,TeapotOfDoom,XD
06-11-2019T17:12:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"like, you said the same word twice but you’re not saying the same word twice"
06-11-2019T17:12:40,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s supposed to be 3 words - just make it 3 words
06-11-2019T17:12:57,TeapotOfDoom,i just read that with a slavic accent and it killed me. cause that's something we actually say when we can't german
06-11-2019T17:13:15,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m still waiting for colors
06-11-2019T17:13:28,SpazztasticKiwi,we’ve gone over just about everything but
06-11-2019T17:13:32,SpazztasticKiwi,and counting
06-11-2019T17:14:13,SpazztasticKiwi,what cracked me up is ich bin frau
06-11-2019T17:14:23,SpazztasticKiwi,I aM wOmAn
06-11-2019T17:14:48,TeapotOfDoom,Ich bin Frau? that's not even german lol wut
06-11-2019T17:15:16,TeapotOfDoom,Ich bin eine Frau now that works
06-11-2019T17:15:27,SpazztasticKiwi,that’s what I’m talking about
06-11-2019T17:16:02,SpazztasticKiwi,"one time I reported a translation because all this time, they tell me die is feminine"
06-11-2019T17:16:17,TeapotOfDoom,you mean Farbe?
06-11-2019T17:16:56,SpazztasticKiwi,but then they gave me a die/der/das Mann and they counted der wrong
06-11-2019T17:18:09,SpazztasticKiwi,they have frau/madchen/mann/junge and their multiples when talking about people
06-11-2019T17:18:23,SpazztasticKiwi,including story exercises - frau counts as wife
06-11-2019T17:18:31,TeapotOfDoom,jup
06-11-2019T17:19:27,SpazztasticKiwi,and who the hell decided was meant what
06-11-2019T17:20:07,TeapotOfDoom,we have some weird stuff you have to get used to. i mean one of the strangest things is as a boy to say a girl is your friend and not your girlfriend. cause both words are the same Freundin
06-11-2019T17:20:26,TeapotOfDoom,same problem the other way round btw
06-11-2019T17:21:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"around here, guys call their girlfriends their girl so it’s not really much different"
06-11-2019T17:21:42,TeapotOfDoom,you mostly do it through saying eine Freundin vs meine Freundin. that for example can lead to some awkward situations
06-11-2019T17:21:52,SpazztasticKiwi,one day I expect one to beat his chest
06-11-2019T17:22:30,TeapotOfDoom,and that's just an example. we have some weird stuff
06-11-2019T17:23:48,TeapotOfDoom,but to turn the thing around who the hell thought it would be a good idea to change become to mean to change into something. In German saying I have become a cat for christmas would not put you into a certain corner in German
