08-08-2019T00:20:07,Mikemkke034,"Anyways, g'night!"
08-08-2019T00:20:58,SpazztasticKiwi,and they finally finit√©
08-08-2019T00:21:46,SpazztasticKiwi,"lord if you talk to anyone else normally, it‚Äôs like you drop off the face of the earth for a nice 5 hours when they‚Äôre going"
08-08-2019T01:07:12,SpazztasticKiwi,I just saw someone call kissing ‚Äúlip guitar‚Äù
08-08-2019T03:40:09,SniperJackal,@CrimsonQuill I kinda got a bit addicted to watching RvB
08-08-2019T03:40:30,SniperJackal,the jokes keep getting better
08-08-2019T03:43:15,SpazztasticKiwi,üõå
08-08-2019T03:56:10,SpazztasticKiwi,nite Tom
08-08-2019T04:10:10,CrimsonQuill,Good morning all
08-08-2019T04:36:21,SniperJackal,morning quill
08-08-2019T04:36:46,CrimsonQuill,@SniperJackal just read through the chat...what season are you on?
08-08-2019T04:37:26,SniperJackal,right now watching episode 100
08-08-2019T04:37:34,CrimsonQuill,Ah...
08-08-2019T04:37:42,CrimsonQuill,The end of the Blood Gulch Chronicles.
08-08-2019T04:37:54,SniperJackal,I havent finished yet but it is interesting
08-08-2019T04:37:56,SniperJackal,anyways
08-08-2019T04:38:02,CrimsonQuill,"After that, you'd best go for 'Out of Mind' and 'Recovery One' Mini-series."
08-08-2019T04:38:19,CrimsonQuill,Because otherwise the start of season 6 might not make so much sense.
08-08-2019T04:38:22,CrimsonQuill,It happened to me.
08-08-2019T04:38:24,SniperJackal,I was dying at the part where Doc 'examined' grif s sister
08-08-2019T04:38:31,CrimsonQuill,Oh God....
08-08-2019T04:38:39,CrimsonQuill,And Tucker kept trying to get in....
08-08-2019T04:38:51,CrimsonQuill,I think Doc genuinly WAS examining her...and was just oblivious.
08-08-2019T04:38:58,SniperJackal,doc is too pure
08-08-2019T04:39:01,CrimsonQuill,The armour on the floor sells it.
08-08-2019T04:39:03,SniperJackal,just like caboose
08-08-2019T04:39:05,CrimsonQuill,XD
08-08-2019T04:39:23,CrimsonQuill,And of course...Before that...well...
08-08-2019T04:39:30,SniperJackal,bow chicka wow wo
08-08-2019T04:39:31,CrimsonQuill,Pelican squash.
08-08-2019T04:39:31,SniperJackal,w
08-08-2019T04:39:37,SniperJackal,yep poor donut
08-08-2019T04:39:49,CrimsonQuill,Down into the hole.
08-08-2019T04:41:13,SniperJackal,I should take more inspiration from caboose
08-08-2019T04:41:28,SniperJackal,just be in my own world hahah
08-08-2019T04:42:21,CrimsonQuill,'So it is a sword. It just happens to function like a key in very specific situations.'
08-08-2019T04:42:56,CrimsonQuill,'Ooooor....Maybe...it's a key all the time...and when you stick it in people...it unlocks their death.'
08-08-2019T04:44:28,SniperJackal,ah Caboose
08-08-2019T04:44:58,CrimsonQuill,My boy
08-08-2019T04:47:09,SniperJackal,Caboose s mindscape is the best thing ever
08-08-2019T04:47:43,CrimsonQuill,"Oh, you ain't seen nothin' yet."
08-08-2019T04:49:58,SniperJackal,Just hang em high
08-08-2019T04:50:02,SniperJackal,you know
08-08-2019T04:50:10,SniperJackal,big and empty
08-08-2019T04:50:23,js199456,Hey guys
08-08-2019T04:50:32,CrimsonQuill,Hullo
08-08-2019T04:51:13,js199456,no new pages for a while :(
08-08-2019T04:51:21,js199456,has something happened?
08-08-2019T04:51:51,SniperJackal,yeah
08-08-2019T04:51:54,SniperJackal,not really
08-08-2019T04:51:57,CrimsonQuill,I don't know
08-08-2019T04:52:01,SniperJackal,I think tom is just a bit tired
08-08-2019T04:52:14,SniperJackal,and not in the mood
08-08-2019T04:52:33,SniperJackal,thats my guess
08-08-2019T04:53:04,js199456,shrugs
08-08-2019T04:54:20,Bgrmystr2,or maybe he had a bunch of conventions this month
08-08-2019T04:54:31,CrimsonQuill,Hullo Bgr
08-08-2019T04:54:35,Bgrmystr2,"or, last month rather"
08-08-2019T04:54:40,Bgrmystr2,and he's been catching up since then
08-08-2019T04:54:45,CrimsonQuill,That would take it out of one.
08-08-2019T04:54:47,Bgrmystr2,and we all knew this would happen
08-08-2019T04:54:52,Bgrmystr2,so it's not a surprise
08-08-2019T04:55:02,Bgrmystr2,and hello quill
08-08-2019T04:56:52,CrimsonQuill,:ptv-victory:
08-08-2019T05:07:38,SniperJackal,ok finished episode 100
08-08-2019T05:07:58,CrimsonQuill,Your are powering through it.
08-08-2019T05:08:07,CrimsonQuill,It's a heavy message isn't it?
08-08-2019T05:08:15,SniperJackal,Yep
08-08-2019T05:08:29,SniperJackal,I just watch it when im bored
08-08-2019T05:08:42,SniperJackal,and thats almost all the time hahah
08-08-2019T05:09:58,SniperJackal,welp time to watch the mini series now I guess
08-08-2019T05:11:01,CrimsonQuill,Yes indeed.
08-08-2019T05:11:09,CrimsonQuill,"Dammit, I missed showing my brother season 3 last night"
08-08-2019T05:11:23,CrimsonQuill,I might just put seasons 3 and 4 on together for him
08-08-2019T05:11:28,CrimsonQuill,While I draw my Halo OCs
08-08-2019T05:13:30,SniperJackal,good luck
08-08-2019T05:13:43,CrimsonQuill,:)
08-08-2019T05:13:50,CrimsonQuill,I finished my OC Bailey's armour
08-08-2019T05:13:54,CrimsonQuill,Now I have to colour it in
08-08-2019T05:14:02,SniperJackal,watching RvB reminds me of last year when I first read twokinds
08-08-2019T05:14:12,SniperJackal,pretty much binging it
08-08-2019T05:14:14,CrimsonQuill,"It has a modified design of Fred's chestpiece, an EOD Helmet, and MK VI Arms and Legs"
08-08-2019T05:14:23,CrimsonQuill,@SniperJackal I'm fairly new too
08-08-2019T05:14:24,SniperJackal,and then being depressed when I finished it
08-08-2019T05:14:30,CrimsonQuill,I only read it December 2017
08-08-2019T05:14:44,SniperJackal,I did it in september last year I think
08-08-2019T05:14:47,CrimsonQuill,And binged chapters 11-19 on a thursday afternoon
08-08-2019T05:14:55,CrimsonQuill,I became a patron June last year
08-08-2019T05:15:04,CrimsonQuill,ANd started trying for crossover stuff
08-08-2019T05:15:08,SniperJackal,Im considering doing that to at somepoint
08-08-2019T05:15:09,CrimsonQuill,Before settling on Halo Raine
08-08-2019T05:15:16,SniperJackal,oh yeah that would be nice
08-08-2019T05:15:30,CrimsonQuill,She became a reality in December last year
08-08-2019T05:15:40,CrimsonQuill,And that's how my Halo fanon started
08-08-2019T05:15:57,SniperJackal,anyways at least watching RvB isnt as emotionally exhausting as Twokinds was
08-08-2019T05:16:10,SniperJackal,thats why I dont reread twokinds as much
08-08-2019T05:16:21,CrimsonQuill,Mate...you haven't seen half of it...
08-08-2019T05:16:36,CrimsonQuill,And let me tell you...it becomes heavy later on...
08-08-2019T05:16:54,CrimsonQuill,I don't know how many times I've reread Twokinds.
08-08-2019T05:17:03,CrimsonQuill,It's the fourth time this year.
08-08-2019T05:17:13,CrimsonQuill,'Stranded' chapter.
08-08-2019T05:17:19,CrimsonQuill,One of my favourites.
08-08-2019T05:18:19,CrimsonQuill,'I'm the bait.' It has to be one of the most brilliant moments in the comic.
08-08-2019T05:18:32,SniperJackal,oh yeah I remember that
08-08-2019T05:18:39,SniperJackal,when red smacked zen with a rock
08-08-2019T05:19:13,CrimsonQuill,Just brilliant for how they managed to plan it right under his nose.
08-08-2019T05:19:32,CrimsonQuill,"And of course, it has my favourite character in prominence..."
08-08-2019T05:19:41,CrimsonQuill,Plus any scene with Nat and Keith.
08-08-2019T05:20:02,CrimsonQuill,He just has a modified version of my accent in my head...I can pack in so much. It's a laugh!
08-08-2019T05:20:25,CrimsonQuill,What's your favourite moment in the comic?
08-08-2019T05:20:32,CrimsonQuill,@SniperJackal
08-08-2019T05:21:26,SniperJackal,oh thats a tough question
08-08-2019T05:21:40,CrimsonQuill,I asked it because I can't pin one down myself
08-08-2019T05:21:45,CrimsonQuill,Not at present anyhow
08-08-2019T05:21:50,SniperJackal,Oh I never thought about how my voice sounds in my head
08-08-2019T05:22:06,CrimsonQuill,Keith for me always has a British Accent.
08-08-2019T05:22:11,CrimsonQuill,As do all the Basitin.
08-08-2019T05:22:20,SniperJackal,Yeah
08-08-2019T05:22:23,CrimsonQuill,My accent is British with a very slight Irish twang.
08-08-2019T05:22:29,CrimsonQuill,So I just...went with it.
08-08-2019T05:22:36,SniperJackal,I mean the king s surname adelaide
08-08-2019T05:22:40,SniperJackal,is adelaide
08-08-2019T05:22:50,SniperJackal,and her daughter is madelyn
08-08-2019T05:22:51,CrimsonQuill,"I remember thinking at the start, 'He looks like he'd have a British accent-I'll give him one'."
08-08-2019T05:22:55,CrimsonQuill,And it went from there.
08-08-2019T05:23:04,CrimsonQuill,Best decision for the comic.
08-08-2019T05:23:15,CrimsonQuill,Besides a hundred other decisions
08-08-2019T05:23:18,SniperJackal,I never thought about the voices
08-08-2019T05:24:25,SniperJackal,"but as for my favourite moment, probably trace revealing himself at edinmire"
08-08-2019T05:24:55,CrimsonQuill,Chilling...Ominous...Magestic...and Determined.
08-08-2019T05:25:05,CrimsonQuill,The expressions are...beautiful.
08-08-2019T05:25:16,SniperJackal,it was badass
08-08-2019T05:25:56,SniperJackal,Im kind of a sucker for any trace related stuff
08-08-2019T05:27:20,CrimsonQuill,"An earlier (put to the side till I get the RaineXRed one up) suggestion I had in mind is Trace as a Jedi, fighting his dark side as a sith-Templar! Trace."
08-08-2019T05:27:48,CrimsonQuill,"Because in his head at the moment, he must have been fighting himself every step of the way to maintain control."
08-08-2019T05:46:45,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-kingtea:
08-08-2019T06:03:48,CrimsonQuill,:]
08-08-2019T06:15:12,SniperJackal,"random fact that I learned, Adelaide is a place in Australia"
08-08-2019T06:16:22,CrimsonQuill,Oh cool.
08-08-2019T06:16:55,SniperJackal,so I guess her accent would be australian /s
08-08-2019T06:22:21,TerraTheWizard,i've said this for a good while
08-08-2019T06:22:37,TerraTheWizard,that i can't read maddie's full name not in an aussie accent
08-08-2019T06:23:28,SniperJackal,hahah
08-08-2019T07:16:09,CrimsonQuill,Umm...King Adelaide sounds like a Margret-Thatcher type accent to me.
08-08-2019T07:16:27,CrimsonQuill,With a bit of something else thrown in.
08-08-2019T08:13:02,SniperJackal,"Yeah I agree, I was just kidding"
08-08-2019T08:13:13,SniperJackal,I cant imagine adelaide with an australian accent
08-08-2019T08:14:10,RimaDraws,hiii
08-08-2019T08:14:25,SniperJackal,hullo
08-08-2019T08:15:49,CrimsonQuill,Hi Rima
08-08-2019T08:22:41,RimaDraws,how is all
08-08-2019T08:34:29,SniperJackal,bored
08-08-2019T08:37:22,SniperJackal,and editing

08-08-2019T09:52:55,AspiringNoodle,"Remember kids, always turn your smartphone off every once in a while, or screwy things can happen"
08-08-2019T09:53:16,AspiringNoodle,Just spent the past 5 minutes trying to get into my phone because it didn't want to show the lock screen xD
08-08-2019T09:57:18,AspiringNoodle,"Also, I was right about my one parts delivrey"
08-08-2019T09:57:22,AspiringNoodle,delivery*
08-08-2019T09:58:00,AspiringNoodle,"Estimated delivery is still monday, but the latest update is ""Out For Delivery Today"""
08-08-2019T10:00:19,AspiringNoodle,"And RIP that poor delivery person. All 3 orders got the same update at 7:16.  That poor person is going to have to move a total 57.3 lbs for my delivery, and the one package is 37.6 lbs"
08-08-2019T10:03:32,Mikemkke034,Oof
08-08-2019T10:03:46,Mikemkke034,All I have is a shirt coming Monday. That's it
08-08-2019T10:03:58,Mikemkke034,A simple lb or two
08-08-2019T10:04:22,AspiringNoodle,Yeeeeeeaaaaaaaaah
08-08-2019T10:04:32,AspiringNoodle,That case is legit 30 lbs or so itself
08-08-2019T10:04:39,Mikemkke034,Damn
08-08-2019T10:04:46,AspiringNoodle,Not too surprising considering it's damn near a full tower
08-08-2019T10:05:03,Mikemkke034,Fair enough. What kind of case?
08-08-2019T10:05:19,AspiringNoodle,https://pcpartpicker.com/list/xGtDpG
08-08-2019T10:05:24,AspiringNoodle,Everything is listed :D
08-08-2019T10:06:03,Mikemkke034,Nice!
08-08-2019T10:06:20,AspiringNoodle,So right now is fun
08-08-2019T10:06:26,Mikemkke034,"Just a tad out of my price range, but I actually understand it all"
08-08-2019T10:06:35,AspiringNoodle,I'm waiting on a response from my boss about coming in today
08-08-2019T10:06:46,Mikemkke034,I have to go in at 12
08-08-2019T10:06:47,AspiringNoodle,I don't want to turn off my phone just in case it doesn't want to come back to life
08-08-2019T10:06:58,AspiringNoodle,And I want to help the delivery person when they arrive because jesus
08-08-2019T10:08:16,Mikemkke034,I feel ya
08-08-2019T10:08:22,AspiringNoodle,"I wanted to finish playing Omikron before the new computer arrived too, just so I didn't have to do the funny stuff to get it to work again"
08-08-2019T10:08:33,AspiringNoodle,But I haven't touched it because of this rpgmaker game xD
08-08-2019T10:08:39,Mikemkke034,Lol
08-08-2019T10:08:53,AspiringNoodle,"Btw, apparently I'd be a fan of the old-school final fantasy / Chrono Trigger games"
08-08-2019T10:09:06,Mikemkke034,Hmm
08-08-2019T10:19:42,AspiringNoodle,"Alright, no work today"
08-08-2019T10:19:55,AspiringNoodle,"I can help that poor delivery person, assuming I'm on point when they arrive :D"
08-08-2019T10:23:01,Mikemkke034,Good luck with that!
08-08-2019T10:23:32,AspiringNoodle,Holy shit.  Epic Games just pulled the most good guy move possible since they've started pissing off the gaming community
08-08-2019T10:24:17,Mikemkke034,That being?
08-08-2019T10:24:23,AspiringNoodle,No loot boxes on their store
08-08-2019T10:24:32,Mikemkke034,Go EG
08-08-2019T10:24:47,Mikemkke034,One step in the right direction
08-08-2019T10:25:07,AspiringNoodle,Gonna watch a video covering the news to get all the details
08-08-2019T10:25:18,AspiringNoodle,Also fuck activision ;D
08-08-2019T10:25:25,Mikemkke034,Agreed
08-08-2019T10:25:39,Mikemkke034,Though I do like CoD
08-08-2019T10:25:52,AspiringNoodle,"Apparently to pair with the good news, Activision proved how scummy they are yet again"
08-08-2019T10:26:08,Mikemkke034,How so
08-08-2019T10:26:14,Mikemkke034,This time
08-08-2019T10:26:18,AspiringNoodle,"The video suggests a new pay-to-win element in BO4 and a new, more expensive, anti-dupe loot crate"
08-08-2019T10:26:31,AspiringNoodle,"Like, Bobby Kotick, plz fucking die in a plane crash"
08-08-2019T10:26:43,AspiringNoodle,I'll throw a giant party convention to celebrate.  All gamers are welcome to attend
08-08-2019T10:27:15,Mikemkke034,I'll attend
08-08-2019T10:27:54,AspiringNoodle,"No joke, back in the 2000's he said that he was bringing in people to explicitly take the fun out of game development"
08-08-2019T10:28:07,Mikemkke034,Seriously
08-08-2019T10:28:16,AspiringNoodle,"Not sure if the statement was intentional or a slip, but given how Activision [Blizzard] has gone under his command, I'm not surprised"
08-08-2019T10:28:56,Mikemkke034,Lol
08-08-2019T10:29:04,AspiringNoodle,From a Kotaku Article:
08-08-2019T10:29:14,AspiringNoodle,"Most notorious was a late 2009 comment he made that seemed to cement his position as more Vader thank Luke. No, he said today, he didn't mean to sound like, his words, ""a dick."""""
08-08-2019T10:29:22,AspiringNoodle,"In September he had told a group of investors: ""The goal that I had in bringing a lot of the packaged goods folks into Activision about 10 years ago was to take all the fun out of making video games."""
08-08-2019T10:29:55,Mikemkke034,Damn

08-08-2019T10:31:32,Mikemkke034,"Well, gtg. Off to work"
08-08-2019T10:31:46,AspiringNoodle,Reality called.  You were never a rebel.  You were always a damn Storm Trooper working to climb the ranks.

08-08-2019T11:37:21,AspiringNoodle,"Haven't even started building yet, and the anxiety is already mounting xD"

08-08-2019T11:57:03,TeapotOfDoom,Go noodle :ctwokinds-rainehappy:

08-08-2019T12:02:30,AspiringNoodle,Everything here
08-08-2019T12:02:57,AspiringNoodle,More or less I'm trying to finish up this youtube backlog before I start
08-08-2019T12:03:13,AspiringNoodle,And move save data for games over to a thumb drive before I move over to the new system
08-08-2019T12:03:38,SomeNiceUser,Good idea.
08-08-2019T12:03:52,SomeNiceUser,"Also, hi guys!"
08-08-2019T12:04:41,AspiringNoodle,"Oh yeah, forgot to mention"
08-08-2019T12:04:48,AspiringNoodle,No Aorus 2070 super available
08-08-2019T12:04:54,AspiringNoodle,So I guess that's good xD
08-08-2019T12:05:04,SomeNiceUser,That sucks.

08-08-2019T12:09:17,SomeNiceUser,Indeed.
08-08-2019T12:10:40,TeapotOfDoom,So which one did you go with?
08-08-2019T12:11:15,AspiringNoodle,"gigabyte's gaming OC, one of the only cards available for MSRP, lol"
08-08-2019T12:11:22,AspiringNoodle,I'm surprised nobody wants it
08-08-2019T12:20:15,TeapotOfDoom,Interesting
08-08-2019T12:20:35,TeapotOfDoom,Well maybe it's not a premium enough card for people do go for it
08-08-2019T13:54:36,Mikemkke034,It's so hot
08-08-2019T13:55:26,Mikemkke034,34 C

08-08-2019T15:18:47,Mikemkke034,Lol
08-08-2019T15:20:03,AspiringNoodle,I didn't expect two of the parts to come until monday
08-08-2019T15:20:13,AspiringNoodle,Do you know how big my youtube backlog is because of that rpg?!?
08-08-2019T15:20:25,tehbear,you ordered them all from different shops?
08-08-2019T15:21:32,tehbear,rpg?
08-08-2019T15:21:33,AspiringNoodle,"Nope.  But two of the shipments came from NJ, and the one was from the other side of the country in CA"
08-08-2019T15:21:55,AspiringNoodle,The one I've been playing for a bit.  There's this program called RPGmaker
08-08-2019T15:22:54,AspiringNoodle,I've more or less learned that I'd like older titles like Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy :3
08-08-2019T15:23:01,tehbear,are you making games with it? iirc its for jrpg style games.
08-08-2019T15:25:31,AspiringNoodle,"Nope, playing games made with it"
08-08-2019T15:25:42,AspiringNoodle,Which is why I said I'd like those titles xD
08-08-2019T15:27:50,tehbear,Chrono Trigger is great. Played it on snes emulator back in 2003

08-08-2019T16:08:21,tehbear,as long as theyre not chickens from Traces mansion it should be ok
08-08-2019T16:09:26,IronHorseComics,of course
08-08-2019T16:23:51,TeapotOfDoom,mmm yes
08-08-2019T16:23:57,TeapotOfDoom,enslaved chicken
08-08-2019T16:24:08,AspiringNoodle,Tonight's dinner
08-08-2019T16:24:15,AspiringNoodle,Caesar salad and BBQ wings :D
08-08-2019T16:24:33,TeapotOfDoom,i just consumed some members of that species as well
08-08-2019T16:24:41,AspiringNoodle,"I would get hot wings, but from what I remember, this place does their sauce differently"
08-08-2019T16:24:48,TeapotOfDoom,kfc never lets you dow
08-08-2019T16:25:08,TeapotOfDoom,also had some freshly made mini doughnuts
08-08-2019T16:25:30,TeapotOfDoom,now i'm listening to queen in my hotel room and thinking about what i might do
08-08-2019T16:26:20,AspiringNoodle,"The wings clearly have sauce on them, but it doesn't seem to stick :ptv-wondering:"
08-08-2019T16:27:32,AspiringNoodle,Good god
08-08-2019T16:27:44,TeapotOfDoom,what up?
08-08-2019T16:27:55,AspiringNoodle,"At this rate, I'm going to need to mark all these youtube videos as ""watch later"""
08-08-2019T16:28:10,AspiringNoodle,It's gonna take me hours to get through everything
08-08-2019T16:28:17,AspiringNoodle,And I want to build a computer now ._.
08-08-2019T16:28:35,TeapotOfDoom,getting videos faster then you can watch em?
08-08-2019T16:28:45,TeapotOfDoom,do it
08-08-2019T16:28:59,TeapotOfDoom,*channels inner palpatine*
08-08-2019T16:29:26,TeapotOfDoom,execute instruction 0x66
08-08-2019T16:30:58,AspiringNoodle,I've been sucked into an RPG for the last week or so
08-08-2019T16:31:11,AspiringNoodle,So I've been queueing up more videos than I've been watching xD
08-08-2019T16:31:46,AspiringNoodle,"I want to say I also need to reevaluate the channels I watch, and whether I need to watch all these videos or not, but I can't really answer that because it's not my routine"
08-08-2019T16:33:39,TeapotOfDoom,why not build the new pc and watch it on that?
08-08-2019T16:37:50,AspiringNoodle,"That's what I'm thinking of doing, lol"
08-08-2019T16:37:59,AspiringNoodle,"First I need to eat, and then I have no idea how long this will take"
08-08-2019T16:45:11,TeapotOfDoom,you don't have watercooling right?
08-08-2019T16:45:27,TeapotOfDoom,and i guess it's your first time doing this
08-08-2019T16:45:46,TeapotOfDoom,so i would guess between two or three hours should do it
08-08-2019T16:47:38,AspiringNoodle,"2nd time, actually"
08-08-2019T16:47:47,AspiringNoodle,"The first time with this case took me all day, lol"
08-08-2019T16:47:54,AspiringNoodle,In part because this case is not a good case xD
08-08-2019T16:48:13,AspiringNoodle,And also because I didn't do research on assembly :P
08-08-2019T16:51:50,TeapotOfDoom,ok then the time should be about the same
08-08-2019T17:39:05,TeapotOfDoom,I'm tired. Have a nice stream everyone! Night! :ctwokinds-RainezZz:

08-08-2019T18:46:27,Azumachan,^
08-08-2019T18:46:44,Bgrmystr2,"While that's true, it could be interpreted either way"

08-08-2019T18:48:18,Mihari,I guess... I mean if you really think that Nora would that big of a dick with the other side of that interpretation.
08-08-2019T18:48:51,Bgrmystr2,I'm not sure how any interpretation makes nora out to be a dick xD

08-08-2019T18:56:43,CrRAR,Well he has amnesia but he's been tempted to use dark magic on quite a few occations in th esame way he did before... for his selfish benefit.
08-08-2019T18:56:45,AspiringNoodle,Sounds like a plot for a sitcom- oh wait

08-08-2019T19:00:03,Mikemkke034,Working
08-08-2019T19:00:34,CrRAR,He has been tempted to alter the flow of events as he's experienced away from what I guess the masks have planned. This tie around attempts involve how he got his corrupted hand. Last time though he borked his mind... somehow protected his body I guess.
08-08-2019T19:01:01,CrRAR,tie = time
08-08-2019T19:02:16,CrRAR,Though arguably he could be one of the masks pawns too... but it's obvious he got out of control and they blanked his memory.
08-08-2019T19:04:43,Mikemkke034,Hmm
08-08-2019T19:04:52,Mikemkke034,Only time will tell!

08-08-2019T19:07:01,Orthonox,"For a comic that has been going on for close to 16 years, we know virtually nothing about the Masks other that they exist and they have machinations that have been laid undetected for years."

08-08-2019T19:07:27,CrRAR,helllloooo
08-08-2019T19:07:35,CrRAR,Maybe as a result of his crazy magic abilities he's been balanced by just having REALLY bad luck.
08-08-2019T19:07:43,CrRAR,Though he did find Flora.
08-08-2019T19:07:47,Mikemkke034,Hmm
08-08-2019T19:07:52,CrRAR,...so he has that going for him. xD
08-08-2019T19:08:30,Mikemkke034,I'd be happy if I were in his shoes

08-08-2019T22:05:18,CrRAR,yeah?
08-08-2019T22:05:21,LannAF,I think that's what happened to me
08-08-2019T22:05:24,LannAF,but
08-08-2019T22:05:26,LannAF,lesser scale
08-08-2019T22:05:28,LannAF,because I'm stupid
08-08-2019T22:05:30,LannAF,not because I had to
08-08-2019T22:05:33,Ordithus,ouch

08-08-2019T22:06:33,Ordithus,huh
08-08-2019T22:06:38,CrRAR,you're probably practically on the uberman sleep schedule
08-08-2019T22:06:41,LannAF,That's what I assume happened to me
08-08-2019T22:06:49,LannAF,Nah I sleep full nights of sleep when I have time
08-08-2019T22:06:55,CrRAR,ah
08-08-2019T22:06:55,LannAF,But I can take 10 minute naps
08-08-2019T22:07:05,LannAF,"and go into rem sleep I assume during it, since I start dreaming immediately."
08-08-2019T22:07:19,CrRAR,"Yeah uberman is like that, power naps straight to REM"
08-08-2019T22:07:23,LannAF,It feels like I've been sleeping for days when I nap
08-08-2019T22:07:28,CrRAR,every 2 hours
08-08-2019T22:07:33,CrRAR,yeah

08-08-2019T22:08:11,LannAF,you can't -not- take the nap
08-08-2019T22:08:16,LannAF,otherwise you're in for a BAD time.

08-08-2019T23:24:23,Mikemkke034,Oof
08-08-2019T23:24:35,Mikemkke034,"Whelp, PS4 is done resetting"

08-08-2019T23:24:39,LannAF,his internet or pc died
08-08-2019T23:24:41,Ordithus,Internet or power went bork
08-08-2019T23:24:42,LannAF,he's off discord
08-08-2019T23:24:43,Mikemkke034,Gotta get that started
08-08-2019T23:24:45,Zakuru,uh oh
08-08-2019T23:24:48,LannAF,don't worry about it he'll be backl
08-08-2019T23:24:56,Mikemkke034,I know
08-08-2019T23:25:02,CrRAR,Extreme disconnect
08-08-2019T23:25:05,LannAF,unless he ISN'TR
08-08-2019T23:25:05,SpazztasticKiwi,the trees ate him
08-08-2019T23:25:07,SageSaga,just hope it was his internet so he didnt lose any work
08-08-2019T23:25:08,NezumiYuki,He'll be back....... in a bad Arnie voice*
08-08-2019T23:25:08,HeresyArtStream,womp womp
08-08-2019T23:25:17,LannAF,his computer has been acting funny
08-08-2019T23:25:18,LannAF,so
08-08-2019T23:25:20,LannAF,hopefully.
08-08-2019T23:25:22,SpazztasticKiwi,oh God bless him
08-08-2019T23:25:26,PurpleLemons,F
08-08-2019T23:25:26,CrRAR,it's so new tho
08-08-2019T23:25:26,NezumiYuki,Dang  =(
08-08-2019T23:25:27,SageSaga,whats it been doing?
08-08-2019T23:25:28,7E21,oh boy
08-08-2019T23:25:28,CrRAR,;_;
08-08-2019T23:25:29,unsteddyphoenix,hope he didnt lose anyting
08-08-2019T23:25:31,SageSaga,he hasnt told me about that
08-08-2019T23:25:37,LannAF,it was only a crash in dbd
08-08-2019T23:25:39,LannAF,er
08-08-2019T23:25:41,LannAF,dying light
08-08-2019T23:25:47,LannAF,I assumed it was the game
08-08-2019T23:25:54,LannAF,but he said something about slowdowns too
08-08-2019T23:26:04,SpazztasticKiwi,start a new habit - save everything every five minutes
08-08-2019T23:26:05,SageSaga,depends on the crash error
08-08-2019T23:26:05,LannAF,that could also be attributed to the fact he has like 5000 things open constantly
08-08-2019T23:26:11,LannAF,>_>
08-08-2019T23:26:15,SpazztasticKiwi,how
08-08-2019T23:26:16,CrRAR,lol
08-08-2019T23:26:18,SpazztasticKiwi,just how
08-08-2019T23:26:23,SpazztasticKiwi,and WHY
08-08-2019T23:26:23,LannAF,it's exaggeration
08-08-2019T23:26:24,CrRAR,ALL the things
08-08-2019T23:26:29,LannAF,"iunno, I do it too"
08-08-2019T23:26:33,LannAF,plenty of people do
08-08-2019T23:26:45,Sclimshady,I have 30 tabs open always
08-08-2019T23:26:48,7E21,I once had my ps crash because I saved :ptv-condescending:
08-08-2019T23:26:55,Ordithus,ouch
08-08-2019T23:26:56,CrRAR,too tempting to only have some things
08-08-2019T23:26:59,unsteddyphoenix,I have...at least 50 tabs open right now
08-08-2019T23:27:01,SageSaga,i usually have 60-100 tabs open at the same time
08-08-2019T23:27:03,SpazztasticKiwi,I have 6 some odd tabs open on my phone right now
08-08-2019T23:27:04,PurpleLemons,If you open everything youll never lose it right?
08-08-2019T23:27:05,Ordithus,I have... 5
08-08-2019T23:27:07,Sclimshady,All the webcomics i regularly read
08-08-2019T23:27:08,unsteddyphoenix,But. Theyre all extremely important
08-08-2019T23:27:16,unsteddyphoenix,exactly!
08-08-2019T23:27:53,LannAF,I had 15 tabs open of the same exact page
08-08-2019T23:27:53,PurpleLemons,"Oh btw sage, i started your comic while i have spare time up north!"
08-08-2019T23:27:57,CrRAR,exactamundo
08-08-2019T23:27:58,LannAF,because I just kept opening new ones
08-08-2019T23:28:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I wonder if we‚Äôd hear the scream if Tom lost his progress
08-08-2019T23:28:09,unsteddyphoenix,Ok well. Lanns just a lunatic
08-08-2019T23:28:17,Sclimshady,Which one purp
08-08-2019T23:28:18,LannAF,tom doesn't really scream
08-08-2019T23:28:25,CrRAR,He saves wicked often
08-08-2019T23:28:33,LannAF,oof.
08-08-2019T23:28:37,LannAF,Total power outage
08-08-2019T23:28:43,CrRAR,augh
08-08-2019T23:28:43,Ordithus,Dang
08-08-2019T23:28:43,SpazztasticKiwi,"Tom doesn‚Äôt make much noise, period"
08-08-2019T23:28:45,FoxxTrotter,"I'm off to bed. G'night, everyone. :0)"
08-08-2019T23:28:46,Sclimshady,Rip
08-08-2019T23:28:51,Ordithus,Night Foxx
08-08-2019T23:28:56,LannAF,Goodnight foxx!

08-08-2019T23:29:13,PurpleLemons,Artificial incident
08-08-2019T23:29:14,Sclimshady,"Dang mobile, night foxx"
08-08-2019T23:29:17,LannAF,that's accurate kiwi
08-08-2019T23:29:31,LannAF,except for when he's laughing his ass off after some weirdly elaborate prank
08-08-2019T23:29:38,Sclimshady,"Was gonna say purp, need a lot of spare time for yosh"
08-08-2019T23:29:49,SpazztasticKiwi,he‚Äôd be great in a horro movie
08-08-2019T23:29:50,LannAF,I'm the loudest
08-08-2019T23:29:57,LannAF,always.

08-08-2019T23:30:03,FluffKevlar,youd die first though
08-08-2019T23:30:10,unsteddyphoenix,accurate on both counts
08-08-2019T23:30:15,CrRAR,haha
08-08-2019T23:30:18,LannAF,no I wouldn't
08-08-2019T23:30:20,SpazztasticKiwi,mainly cause something would go thump and he‚Äôd not so much as bother getting up to investigate
08-08-2019T23:30:23,FluffKevlar,"we'd hear ""OH FRICK!"" then your head rolls down the stairs"
08-08-2019T23:30:26,unsteddyphoenix,Yes you would youre a minority
08-08-2019T23:30:31,LannAF,the heck

08-08-2019T23:30:38,SpazztasticKiwi,"lann, on the other hand, would stick his whole self into the cursed room"
08-08-2019T23:30:42,Sclimshady,Rip Lann
08-08-2019T23:30:46,unsteddyphoenix,Its like youve never SEEN a horror movie

08-08-2019T23:31:16,FluffKevlar,sage might be whiter than me though
08-08-2019T23:31:20,LannAF,I'd be the most likely to survive
08-08-2019T23:31:21,SageSaga,I am
08-08-2019T23:31:25,LannAF,Because of mad skills
08-08-2019T23:31:30,LannAF,-fingerguns-

08-08-2019T23:32:27,Twokinds,On mu phone

08-08-2019T23:32:43,Twokinds,House is dark

08-08-2019T23:33:09,unsteddyphoenix,No hes not here

08-08-2019T23:33:16,SpazztasticKiwi,yeah we never got any crazy fan stories yesterday
08-08-2019T23:33:27,unsteddyphoenix,true horror stories
08-08-2019T23:33:34,LannAF,fluff
08-08-2019T23:33:38,Twokinds,It was very sudden
08-08-2019T23:33:41,LannAF,are there any games you've been wanting to try?
08-08-2019T23:33:44,SpazztasticKiwi,‚Äúthey might be watching‚Äù even tho there was like 11 viewers
08-08-2019T23:33:54,FluffKevlar,"yeah, a lot. though lot of them are SP"
08-08-2019T23:33:56,FluffKevlar,hrm
08-08-2019T23:34:00,Twokinds,There was no bad weather
08-08-2019T23:34:00,LannAF,those don't matter.
08-08-2019T23:34:01,SageSaga,Electromagnetic interference passes from our side to the upside down
08-08-2019T23:34:03,LannAF,they don't exist.
08-08-2019T23:34:26,CrimsonHelsing,"God, I hope you didn't lose anything with that outage, @Twokinds!"
08-08-2019T23:34:45,SageSaga,just time- precious fleeting time
08-08-2019T23:34:55,LannAF,just buy more.
08-08-2019T23:35:02,SpazztasticKiwi,May have to finish later
08-08-2019T23:35:03,LannAF,problems solved.
08-08-2019T23:35:06,CrRAR,it was a solid stream.
08-08-2019T23:35:09,SpazztasticKiwi,in the afterlife
08-08-2019T23:35:11,LannAF,it was liquid
08-08-2019T23:35:15,Sclimshady,Lemme just pop to the time store
08-08-2019T23:35:19,SageSaga,No amount of money in the world has ever bought a second of time.
08-08-2019T23:35:19,LannAF,flowed like water
08-08-2019T23:35:27,LannAF,oh yeah?
08-08-2019T23:35:30,NezumiYuki,Flow like water....
08-08-2019T23:35:31,LannAF,then explain dio
08-08-2019T23:35:34,NezumiYuki,Become water
08-08-2019T23:35:34,SageSaga,- Howard Stark
08-08-2019T23:35:51,unsteddyphoenix,but time IS money
08-08-2019T23:35:53,SageSaga,money didnt give him his power Lann
08-08-2019T23:35:58,unsteddyphoenix,-multiple highschool teachers
08-08-2019T23:36:03,LannAF,he bought the means to procure his power
08-08-2019T23:36:05,PurpleLemons,Explain King Crimson
08-08-2019T23:36:05,LannAF,therefore
08-08-2019T23:36:09,LannAF,money gave him his power
08-08-2019T23:36:12,LannAF,It just works purple.
08-08-2019T23:36:26,SpazztasticKiwi,he was able to cry in a Lamborghini rather than the street tho
08-08-2019T23:36:40,SageSaga,also technically neither of those give you more time because time is not moving
08-08-2019T23:36:50,LannAF,but -you- technically have more time
08-08-2019T23:36:52,Sclimshady,Lamborghini's would make any car guy sad
08-08-2019T23:36:58,SageSaga,but you arent buying it
08-08-2019T23:36:59,SpazztasticKiwi,my katto has appeared with affection
08-08-2019T23:37:03,SageSaga,thats the whole point
08-08-2019T23:37:07,LannAF,you bought the access to additional time though
08-08-2019T23:37:11,Sclimshady,:cat:
08-08-2019T23:37:12,LannAF,is that not buying it
08-08-2019T23:37:20,NezumiYuki,"Hug the catto, Kiwis!"
08-08-2019T23:37:27,LannAF,I suppose it's semantics at that point
08-08-2019T23:37:32,LannAF,"either way, not our world."
08-08-2019T23:37:34,LannAF,...Yet.
08-08-2019T23:37:40,SpazztasticKiwi,this is like watching to siblings fight over who gets to sit in the front seat
08-08-2019T23:37:43,SpazztasticKiwi,two
08-08-2019T23:37:47,LannAF,I DESERVE TO BE IN FRONT.
08-08-2019T23:37:49,SageSaga,no- we are talking about money for time- Bill Gates cant drop a billion dollars and live an extra year
08-08-2019T23:38:03,unsteddyphoenix,Technically he could extend his lifespan
08-08-2019T23:38:08,SpazztasticKiwi,he can drop a few million and get work done tho
08-08-2019T23:38:12,LannAF,but it's not necessarily buying time
08-08-2019T23:38:16,LannAF,he means a literal exchange.
08-08-2019T23:38:25,Sclimshady,With expensive medical stuff
08-08-2019T23:38:35,SpazztasticKiwi,so Tom how‚Äôs it going
08-08-2019T23:38:51,LannAF,he's currently rereouting his power grid
08-08-2019T23:38:55,SpazztasticKiwi,are we still party Nibbly status
08-08-2019T23:38:57,LannAF,he'll be a few
08-08-2019T23:39:04,Sclimshady,:ctwokinds-nibsbdaydance:
08-08-2019T23:39:06,LannAF,I'm joking if that's not obvious
08-08-2019T23:39:13,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-nibsbdaydance:
08-08-2019T23:39:17,Twokinds,Well its not dark
08-08-2019T23:39:20,SpazztasticKiwi,wonder if he‚Äôll see it worth it to restart the stream
08-08-2019T23:39:22,Sclimshady,It was lann
08-08-2019T23:39:24,InTheLionsDen,:ctwokinds-nibsbdaydance:
08-08-2019T23:39:24,PurpleLemons,Start up the old generator
08-08-2019T23:39:28,LannAF,is that because you set fire to the house?
08-08-2019T23:39:30,SpazztasticKiwi,yeah for the advancement of lights
08-08-2019T23:39:42,Twokinds,My lamp is attached to a ups
08-08-2019T23:40:04,SpazztasticKiwi,..ok
08-08-2019T23:40:11,LannAF,so
08-08-2019T23:40:14,LannAF,he is sitting at a light
08-08-2019T23:40:16,LannAF,in a dark house
08-08-2019T23:40:18,Twokinds,It'll last for 564 min apparently
08-08-2019T23:40:19,LannAF,with only his phone
08-08-2019T23:40:26,LannAF,dude you're starting a horror story
08-08-2019T23:40:31,Sclimshady,"Dang, thats pretty good"
08-08-2019T23:40:32,LannAF,get out
08-08-2019T23:40:33,unsteddyphoenix,Thats all?
08-08-2019T23:40:35,LannAF,find the key
08-08-2019T23:40:42,SpazztasticKiwi,don‚Äôt go in the attic
