25-11-2019T12:31:13,JojoF2415,Lol
25-11-2019T13:17:37,AspiringNoodle,She confuddled :P
25-11-2019T13:17:44,AspiringNoodle,"Head says no, heart says yes"
25-11-2019T18:42:23,SpazztasticKiwi,now one with trace messing up his vows

25-11-2019T20:01:36,Dadrobit,"Mmmm, celebrating Thanksgiving tomorrow, can't wait for all the fods!"
25-11-2019T20:01:42,Dadrobit,foods*
25-11-2019T20:03:15,Dadrobit,Tomorrow was the best available time that would allow for a majority of the family to congregate together. Then actual Thanksgiving all the individual families celebrate with themselves and their individualized close ones.
25-11-2019T20:08:04,SpazztasticKiwi,yea the holidays
25-11-2019T20:08:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I work
25-11-2019T20:08:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"oh , have you gotten tired of babysitting BB yet?"
25-11-2019T20:12:05,Dadrobit,"Not in the slightest. Alas, I have't had the time to play any games for like a week and a half. So that's a factor"
25-11-2019T20:17:56,SpazztasticKiwi,get ready
25-11-2019T20:18:35,SpazztasticKiwi,"only watching, and I’m already tired of the thing"
25-11-2019T20:23:37,SpazztasticKiwi,almost through with ch 5
25-11-2019T20:35:31,Dadrobit,"Yeah, mentioned the other day. I can see why folks would not be into it. Same deal for No Man's Sky. And I have hundreds of hours dumped into that game. The gather and move gameplay loop isn't for everyone."
25-11-2019T20:36:58,Dadrobit,I find it incredibly relaxing. It's just a nice zen experience for me.
25-11-2019T20:44:24,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s like he said he’d heard: taking care of kids in real life is a struggle  but rewarding but in a game it’s just a struggle
25-11-2019T20:44:50,SpazztasticKiwi,is telling you terrain later in the game a spoiler?
25-11-2019T20:46:56,Dadrobit,"Yeah, kinda sorry. I'm playing super blind."
25-11-2019T20:47:13,Dadrobit,"I know there's going to be snow, but that's it."
25-11-2019T20:47:34,Dadrobit,"Yeah, kinda. Sorry.*"
25-11-2019T20:49:48,SpazztasticKiwi,oh well that was it - the snow
25-11-2019T20:51:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"since I’m technically further in, there’s not much else past mechanics I can say"
25-11-2019T20:52:34,SpazztasticKiwi,come across any of Seán’s structures yet?
25-11-2019T20:52:52,Dadrobit,Can't say I'd know em' if I saw em.
25-11-2019T20:53:23,Dadrobit,Lots of structures though. And I've spent more than a few hours building and upgrading to help other folks.
25-11-2019T20:55:05,SpazztasticKiwi,each thing has its builder’s name on it tho right?
25-11-2019T20:55:37,Dadrobit,"Yeah, but I dunno what Sean's name is."
25-11-2019T20:57:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Seán is under jack_septic_eye
25-11-2019T21:00:45,JojoF2415,Hello
25-11-2019T21:00:55,SpazztasticKiwi,or jack_septiceye - I cant see it good
25-11-2019T21:28:56,AspiringNoodle,Thank eff the day's over
25-11-2019T21:29:14,AspiringNoodle,"Schedule for 6 hours, worked 7.  I took no breaks because there was that much stuff to do."
25-11-2019T21:29:26,AspiringNoodle,I'm just like... what the hell does first shift DO?
25-11-2019T22:01:16,Dadrobit,I know what my first shif t does.
25-11-2019T22:01:21,Dadrobit,Fuuuuuucking nooooooothing
25-11-2019T22:01:27,Dadrobit,shift*
25-11-2019T22:02:25,Dadrobit,"Idiots took tickets to a hockey game meant for ""someone"" but they forgot who and forgot who gave it to them."
25-11-2019T22:02:33,Dadrobit,"Like, what the fuck?!?!?"
25-11-2019T22:02:53,Dadrobit,"There are TWO of you in the morning, and neither one of you could be assed to take ANY notes on this???"
25-11-2019T22:03:11,Dadrobit,"""We were busy."""
25-11-2019T22:03:51,Dadrobit,"Bitch, I've worked ""busy"". Taking notes on package deliveries takes SECONDS. These motherfuckers are dangerously lazy."
25-11-2019T22:04:22,Dadrobit,Documentation is literally 99% of any security job and these fuckers can't even do that.
25-11-2019T22:09:57,AspiringNoodle,"My gas station job is not as serious, but it was pretty bad"
25-11-2019T22:10:03,AspiringNoodle,All surfaces for food were a mess
25-11-2019T22:10:18,AspiringNoodle,It looked like NOBODY stocked the cooler at ANY point in the morning
25-11-2019T22:11:40,AspiringNoodle,"Cigarettes barely got stocked.  Bathroom was a mess.  A lot of stuff was running out.  Somebody put hotdogs in the sink to thaw, but I don't know when since it was communicated to no-one"
25-11-2019T22:12:24,AspiringNoodle,"It's just like... what the hell do they do, especially since they have 3, count them, THREE, cashiers for the morning"
25-11-2019T22:12:35,AspiringNoodle,Plus a manager or two
25-11-2019T22:13:02,AspiringNoodle,"Meanwhile second shift is 1 person in the kitchen, and 2 people on registers, nobody else"
25-11-2019T22:13:24,AspiringNoodle,"But my rant aside, somebody needs to slap those 2 upside the head"
25-11-2019T22:13:32,Dadrobit,"It took me a non zero amount of thought to recognize the person who gave it was the coach that lives behind my gate, but fucking still. I should not have to be the guy at 10 at night calling around to verify this shit."
25-11-2019T22:15:24,Dadrobit,And now I have to go in and see what other fires need putting out...
25-11-2019T22:15:27,Dadrobit,Bleh
25-11-2019T22:15:47,AspiringNoodle,*sends good vibes*
25-11-2019T22:16:01,AspiringNoodle,Huzzah for working with the lazy / idiots :D
25-11-2019T22:16:25,Dadrobit,"(Also, Go Coyotes! They're smashing this season!)"
