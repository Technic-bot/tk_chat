01-01-2019T12:16:12,CrimsonQuill,"Heh, me too"
01-01-2019T12:16:25,CrimsonQuill,I was cutting and pulling out some really nasty brambles.
01-01-2019T12:17:12,CrimsonQuill,A rather big garden spider fell from a lump of ivy I was tearing away. Good thing I had gloves.
01-01-2019T12:17:36,CrimsonQuill,"My normal reaction to spiders used to be to squash them, but I don't do that anymore."
01-01-2019T12:17:47,CrimsonQuill,Not after Muffet's spider dance and tea party.

01-01-2019T15:38:08,CrimsonQuill,Is everyone from chapter 19 in the manor?
01-01-2019T15:38:15,TerraTheWizard,"plot twist, this is the collar of de-keidranification"
01-01-2019T15:38:39,CrimsonQuill,"Well, I remember a sketch where Raine trys it on in her halfway form and stumps it."

01-01-2019T15:46:31,Twokinds,I enojoyed making that one.
01-01-2019T15:46:51,CrimsonQuill,"Heh, I can see why"
01-01-2019T15:47:45,Azumachan,Interesting design indeed.

01-01-2019T16:04:28,Twokinds,Just saw a comment on the earlier page

01-01-2019T16:04:36,Twokinds,Hahaha

01-01-2019T16:06:50,Xexanoth,lol
01-01-2019T16:08:25,CrimsonQuill,What's with the 'cleave them in two'? Is that to do with Templar! Trace?
01-01-2019T16:09:41,BadFoMo,"Man, this one (1) page a week thing is killing me. I mean, I couldn't do it faster myself; but still."
01-01-2019T16:10:44,BadFoMo,"Also, thoes collers cause Basitins to explode? ...How?"
01-01-2019T16:11:33,Azumachan,Magic
01-01-2019T16:12:07,Twokinds,"Basitins resist magic, causing a magic-antimagic feedback loop."
01-01-2019T16:12:26,CrimsonQuill,Like Dwarves in Lord of the Rings.
01-01-2019T16:12:43,CrimsonQuill,"They're naturally resistant to magic, and the effects thereof."
01-01-2019T16:12:59,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-clovisgirl_shake:
01-01-2019T16:13:40,Twokinds,Also I'm lying. I'm not sure what would happen if a Basitin wore it.
01-01-2019T16:13:43,BadFoMo,...So it would look like the Slave Collers from Fallout?
01-01-2019T16:13:48,BadFoMo,Oh...
01-01-2019T16:14:19,CrimsonQuill,"Well, isn't that one of the joys of writing a comic? Having stuff happen that you never dreamed about?"
01-01-2019T16:17:51,ScarderXD,:thinking:
01-01-2019T16:18:19,Twokinds,I guess
01-01-2019T16:19:39,CrimsonQuill,"Of course, the only time that happened with me was writing a star trek/Doctor Who crossover ... I realised that I disliked one of the characters, and then was surprised at a few plot devices that opened up in my head."
01-01-2019T16:19:48,CrimsonQuill,But it's forst draft.
01-01-2019T16:19:51,CrimsonQuill,Still
01-01-2019T16:20:22,CrimsonQuill,"Ok, have I broken the chat with a wall of text again?"

01-01-2019T16:21:50,iliar,@CrimsonQuill Create good lore not so easily as you think. You should always take care that new knowledge does not contradict what has been said before.

01-01-2019T16:22:29,CrimsonQuill,@Iliar That's what happened
01-01-2019T16:22:39,CrimsonQuill,I realised that one thing might contradict the lore
01-01-2019T16:22:46,CrimsonQuill,And added a plot device to explain it
01-01-2019T16:22:58,CrimsonQuill,By using the idea of an 'experimental device'
01-01-2019T16:23:10,CrimsonQuill,"Besides, it's a multiverse mashup"
01-01-2019T16:23:52,CrimsonQuill,"Basic premise is: Put three Daleks on a Starship just like the 2009 Enterprise, and watch them kill everyone."

01-01-2019T16:39:02,Dadrobit,The 6th sketch Tom had done for Patreon of Keith.
01-01-2019T16:39:15,CrimsonQuill,I know
01-01-2019T16:39:26,CrimsonQuill,But then again...
01-01-2019T16:39:39,CrimsonQuill,Whut
01-01-2019T16:39:55,CrimsonQuill,"Actually, I'm going to throw a question into the air."
01-01-2019T16:39:57,Dadrobit,https://www.patreon.com/posts/stockings-6906785 Canon. They're all canon.
01-01-2019T16:40:56,CrimsonQuill,"If our Resident dragon Nora tried to change a Basitin into a Keidran, or anything, would the magic just bounce off?"
01-01-2019T16:41:23,Dadrobit,No?
01-01-2019T16:41:35,CrimsonQuill,"Tom, any answers?"
01-01-2019T16:41:46,CrimsonQuill,Or shall you leave us writhing in mystery?
01-01-2019T16:41:46,Dadrobit,Keidran are really only resisntant to minor magics like those of the fairies.
01-01-2019T16:41:55,CrimsonQuill,Basitins
01-01-2019T16:42:00,Dadrobit,"Yeah, those ones"
01-01-2019T16:43:24,Dadrobit,Templar forces were the deciding factor in the Basitin-Keidran war. And Trace alone had the magical affinity to destroy the King's guard.
01-01-2019T16:43:46,Dadrobit,Nora is magnitudes more powerful than Trace.
01-01-2019T16:43:49,CrimsonQuill,Black Magic
01-01-2019T16:43:54,CrimsonQuill,HMM...
01-01-2019T16:44:04,CrimsonQuill,you're probably right
01-01-2019T16:44:15,Twokinds,Nora's magic would still affect most Basitin.
01-01-2019T16:44:49,CrimsonQuill,Ok
01-01-2019T16:45:27,Twokinds,Basitin become more resist to magic the stronger they are. Adelaide is almost completely immune to direct magic.
01-01-2019T16:45:35,Dadrobit,"Except the King. Nora tries to gender bend her, and it just bounces back and transforms Nora into Neil."
01-01-2019T16:45:39,Twokinds,(Though of course you could still use magic to throw a rock at her or something)
01-01-2019T16:45:57,CrimsonQuill,I was wondering how she survived all that ruckus she went through...

01-01-2019T16:46:16,CrimsonQuill,:ptv-greetings:
01-01-2019T16:46:21,Dadrobit,I think I might have a suggestion there...
01-01-2019T16:46:50,CrimsonQuill,"See, when I think about 'Resistant to magic', my immediate idea is similar to the 'null' in Sage's Yosh!"
01-01-2019T16:47:00,CrimsonQuill,Someone who's immune to magic completely.
01-01-2019T16:47:43,CrimsonQuill,"Indeed, one of my favourite daydreams is to put some SAS Soldiers in a Harry Potter setting, immune to magic, and see them assassinate Death Eaters."
01-01-2019T16:49:48,Xexanoth,"...that's like putting someone immune to bullets into a war setting, what's the point of someone who can't be harmed by hs enemies, seems pretty boring"

01-01-2019T16:50:29,Dadrobit,They are.

01-01-2019T16:58:25,CrimsonQuill,"Oh, I use carbolic soap to remove the leftover corruption."
01-01-2019T16:58:37,CrimsonQuill,I don't think I really have an O.C. though...
01-01-2019T16:59:00,CrimsonQuill,Most of my 'characters' are just excuses to come up with concepts for scifi weapons.
01-01-2019T16:59:04,CrimsonQuill,They have no souls.
01-01-2019T16:59:39,CrimsonQuill,They're just a reason for me to invent the same type of power armor in my head a hundred times.

01-01-2019T17:28:31,Twokinds,in my mailbox
01-01-2019T17:28:36,Twokinds,:(
01-01-2019T17:28:57,Bgrmystr2,what why
01-01-2019T17:29:00,Bgrmystr2,D:
01-01-2019T17:29:23,Bgrmystr2,"it's illegal for someone to open someone else's mail, is something missing from it?"
01-01-2019T17:29:32,Twokinds,It's empty.
01-01-2019T17:29:56,Bgrmystr2,..yeah file a theft claim with the shipping company
01-01-2019T17:30:00,Azumachan,It happened to me last week
01-01-2019T17:30:07,Bgrmystr2,or whatevery place you ordered
01-01-2019T17:30:14,Bgrmystr2,..whatever* eklfbhkas
01-01-2019T17:30:44,Bgrmystr2,I'm sure amazon and the side sellers cover that kind of thing
01-01-2019T17:30:51,CrimsonQuill,My sister actually experienced that.
01-01-2019T17:31:07,CrimsonQuill,"She wrote a letter to a friend in the US, and put a little gift in the envelope."
01-01-2019T17:31:16,CrimsonQuill,The gift was gone when the letter arrived.
01-01-2019T17:31:21,CrimsonQuill,Someone had nicked it.
01-01-2019T17:31:47,Bgrmystr2,"that tells me someone at the shipping company took it, not someone going to your house"
01-01-2019T17:32:12,Bgrmystr2,cuz someone stealing a package would just steal the whole thing and open it later rather than waste time opening it at your doorstep
01-01-2019T17:32:41,Bgrmystr2,it also might have fingerprints on it? :O
01-01-2019T17:33:14,MrEase,that sucks
01-01-2019T17:45:22,SpazztasticKiwi,My sisters Christmas present came two days late than I was told
01-01-2019T17:45:32,SpazztasticKiwi,And they had crushed half the box
01-01-2019T17:47:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Havenâ€™t had packages raided though. We live out in nowhere woods

01-01-2019T17:56:08,CrimsonQuill,Sleep well
01-01-2019T18:01:27,Dadrobit,Package theft sucks. Caught one bastard last year on a bike going from mailbox to mailbox down the road and taking out pieces of mail and putting them in a basket. Right before Christmas.
01-01-2019T18:01:59,Dadrobit,"Called the cops on it, hope they caught the bastard."
01-01-2019T18:05:00,Twokinds,This is the first time I've had a package stolen.
01-01-2019T18:05:30,Twokinds,"Luckily, it was only a 5 dollar item. But still annoying. I'd be upset if it had been something important."
01-01-2019T18:08:03,Bgrmystr2,yeah
01-01-2019T18:08:06,Bgrmystr2,absolutely report it
01-01-2019T18:08:29,Bgrmystr2,"it's one thing to steal a package, but it's another thing for them to open the package itself and take the item, but not the box"

01-01-2019T20:54:44,Bgrmystr2,not sure where I stand
01-01-2019T20:57:30,CrRAR,:thinking:
01-01-2019T20:57:44,CrRAR,Those colors remind me of the care bears.
01-01-2019T20:58:02,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-wondering:
01-01-2019T20:58:13,Bgrmystr2,they aren't dead yet?
01-01-2019T21:01:11,CrRAR,I suppose if you murdered them and cut out their hearts.
01-01-2019T21:01:36,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-condescending: I would never do that...
01-01-2019T21:02:49,CrRAR,"Damn then, idk"
01-01-2019T21:09:12,RimaDraws,ouch
01-01-2019T21:14:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I got a smurf cupcake
01-01-2019T21:14:47,Xexanoth,:ptv-shock:
01-01-2019T21:14:56,Xexanoth,what did that poor smurf ever do to you
01-01-2019T21:15:11,SpazztasticKiwi,It was tasty
01-01-2019T21:15:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Some bright blue icing though
01-01-2019T21:17:30,RimaDraws,lol
01-01-2019T21:20:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Weâ€™re goin to Tupelo for Aquaman tomorrow
01-01-2019T21:25:11,CrRAR,ooo neat
01-01-2019T21:26:55,CrRAR,"was the smurf cupcake papa smurf, brainy smurf, smurfette, baby smurf, or ACME generic smurfâ„¢?!?"
01-01-2019T21:30:40,SpazztasticKiwi,It was a blue cupcake
01-01-2019T21:43:08,CrRAR,I was just imagining a cupcake done up with a lil blue smurf head on it.
01-01-2019T21:47:31,CrRAR,Gargamel would be so pleased.
01-01-2019T21:52:38,Twokinds,I've been making so much progress!
01-01-2019T21:52:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Huzzah
01-01-2019T21:53:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Sound the trumpets
01-01-2019T21:53:10,MrEase,woot
01-01-2019T21:53:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Call out the fireworks
01-01-2019T21:53:25,MrEase,I've just been playing smash bros when I should be drawing sin
01-01-2019T21:53:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Sound the alarm and donâ€™t forget to panic in the streets
01-01-2019T21:56:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Are the hours of antisocialism worth it?
01-01-2019T21:57:56,MrEase,yes
01-01-2019T21:58:19,Twokinds,yes
01-01-2019T21:58:40,MrEase,I mean to be fair I'd be anti-social if I was drawing what I was going to draw anyway
01-01-2019T22:35:52,Dadrobit,"Knowing something of what you draw, I wouldn't call it anti-social. Just that it's mostly appreciated by a very niche society."
01-01-2019T22:37:49,MrEase,eh some of what I do is general furry art
01-01-2019T22:37:58,MrEase,actually like 70%
01-01-2019T22:39:55,CrRAR,...the SOCIETY rises. *buwkaawww*
01-01-2019T22:41:21,MrEase,okay maybe 65%
01-01-2019T22:42:55,Dadrobit,It would appear some number crunching is in order?
01-01-2019T22:44:01,Dadrobit,"Also, even if it's furry, I'd still consider that a niche society. Believe it or not, us non-furries are very much a large part of the planet."
01-01-2019T22:48:59,Bgrmystr2,"""Us non-furries"" Dadro pls"
01-01-2019T22:49:33,SpazztasticKiwi,How bad would you say cheeze itâ€™s and sour cream is for you
01-01-2019T22:51:10,Xexanoth,"he's clearly not a furry bgr, just look at his profile picture :ptv-snicker:"
01-01-2019T22:51:22,MrEase,123/187 are general furry art
01-01-2019T22:53:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Siri says thatâ€™s 65.77540106951872%
01-01-2019T22:53:32,SpazztasticKiwi,So...66%ish
01-01-2019T22:54:15,Mippy,I actually gamed tonight XD he he :ctwokinds-keifacepalm: ugh
01-01-2019T22:54:35,MrEase,so I'm not all creepy fetishes

01-01-2019T22:55:03,Mippy,Creepy fetishes? :ctwokinds-floraquestion: like inflation

01-01-2019T22:55:45,unsteddyphoenix,And prolonged eye contact

01-01-2019T22:56:42,unsteddyphoenix,Why have I only ever seen the weird stuff then :thinking:
01-01-2019T22:58:28,Mippy,I need to draw some weird stuffs...
01-01-2019T22:59:01,MrEase,because search algorithms make fetishes easier to find and they get like 30-50+ more faves than my normal stuff
01-01-2019T22:59:27,unsteddyphoenix,Hmm
01-01-2019T22:59:28,MrEase,"though I guess macro micro isn't weird, there used to be a couple pics like that on toms deviantart"
01-01-2019T22:59:33,unsteddyphoenix,Im gonna scour for the normal stuff

01-01-2019T23:01:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Thereâ€™s some weird stuff that trips peopleâ€™s triggers nowadays
01-01-2019T23:01:27,unsteddyphoenix,"Hm ok, there is some"
01-01-2019T23:01:33,unsteddyphoenix,I'll allow it. This time.
01-01-2019T23:02:53,Mippy,Prolly always was Kiwi
01-01-2019T23:03:20,unsteddyphoenix,maybe theres just more weird stuff
01-01-2019T23:03:57,MrEase,if its only 1/3 theres not that much haha
01-01-2019T23:04:33,Mippy,1/3 of a pizza is quite a bit
01-01-2019T23:05:01,Ordithus,5/8 of a pizza is even more :ctwokinds-reniderp:
01-01-2019T23:05:14,Mippy,:ctwokinds-zenshocked:
01-01-2019T23:05:35,unsteddyphoenix,Thats quick maths

01-01-2019T23:11:57,unsteddyphoenix,already? damn
01-01-2019T23:12:06,Mippy,Yup
01-01-2019T23:12:46,Mippy,Iâ€™m over holidaying anyway
01-01-2019T23:13:34,MrEase,digital was rough for me to learn but a year and 4 months in and I think I got it
01-01-2019T23:13:48,RimaDraws,ugh dozed off

01-01-2019T23:15:28,Mippy,Itâ€™s part of our curriculum for the program Iâ€™m in. Iâ€™m looking forward to it. Iâ€™m not looking forward to the time itâ€™s at though. I wonâ€™t get out of class until nearly 9:00pm
01-01-2019T23:17:09,Ordithus,:ptv-nope:
01-01-2019T23:24:33,CrRAR,"Augh, is it a 3hr format class!?"

01-01-2019T23:35:52,RimaDraws,oh boy
01-01-2019T23:38:21,MrEase,that was what I had to deal with in Sheridan college
01-01-2019T23:48:25,unsteddyphoenix,Those were almost my entire uni experience
01-01-2019T23:48:47,unsteddyphoenix,Half the time not even the lecturers can last the long
01-01-2019T23:52:43,MrEase,45 minutes of teaching then 2 hours of work
