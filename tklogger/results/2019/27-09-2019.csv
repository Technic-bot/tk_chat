27-09-2019T00:07:58,CrimsonHelsing,"say Tom, random thought: would anyone in the history of Mekkan have happened to accidentally discover a mix for nitroglycerin? (or equivalent)"
27-09-2019T00:08:21,Twokinds,I don't know?
27-09-2019T00:08:31,ZRO4825,Who needs nitro when you can literally throw balls of fire? o.o
27-09-2019T00:09:01,CrimsonHelsing,"for... idk, those that want a boom but don't have the skill or patience for magic? *shrug*"

27-09-2019T00:09:48,SageSaga,i think its a better world when you have to be patient and careful in order to gain the ability to explode things
27-09-2019T00:10:18,AnuSekaniArt,Wat? XD
27-09-2019T00:10:21,CrimsonHelsing,"yeah, buuut then again even in fantasy settings... heheh, y'know, humans. xD"
27-09-2019T00:10:41,HeresyArtStream,"maybe I was cooking recently and accidentally got some hot oil splashed on them, which might have melted the fleece."
27-09-2019T00:10:51,CrimsonHelsing,yikes!
27-09-2019T00:11:07,HeresyArtStream,"I don't remember any such thing happening though, which is the odd part."
27-09-2019T00:11:39,HeresyArtStream,"My initially hypothesis was that it was glue, but after washing it became clear that it was melted fleece."
27-09-2019T00:12:01,AnuSekaniArt,That's bizarre XD
27-09-2019T00:12:03,HeresyArtStream,"Guess that's my queue to buy some new ones, lol."

27-09-2019T15:14:49,TeapotOfDoom,Goku vs Saitama
27-09-2019T15:14:58,TeapotOfDoom,i wanna see now
27-09-2019T15:15:34,TeapotOfDoom,"o/ Anu, Zro"
27-09-2019T15:25:41,SageSaga,brb brb
27-09-2019T15:27:26,AnuSekaniArt,Oki!
27-09-2019T15:28:05,SageSaga,back
27-09-2019T15:29:21,AnuSekaniArt,WB ^^
27-09-2019T15:40:17,AnuSekaniArt,I really love the way you do shading Sage ^^
27-09-2019T15:41:24,SageSaga,ty
27-09-2019T15:46:14,AnuSekaniArt,Guessing you developed it through just trial and error? Went with what works?
27-09-2019T15:46:48,ZRO4825,"Lookin good, Sage. Enjoy your evening, I'm off to work. ^^/"
27-09-2019T15:46:53,SageSaga,kinda- shading is all about how shadows fall
27-09-2019T15:46:56,SageSaga,take care Zro
27-09-2019T15:47:02,AnuSekaniArt,Take care ZRO!
27-09-2019T15:47:07,TeapotOfDoom,Bye Zro!
27-09-2019T15:47:10,SageSaga,so there are rules to how shading technically works
27-09-2019T15:47:23,TeapotOfDoom,sounds interesting
27-09-2019T15:48:00,SageSaga,unfortunately and thankfully- most people dont really understand how they work- so my stuff isnt hyper accurate but my mistakes arent noticed by most XD
27-09-2019T15:48:13,AnuSekaniArt,Fair XD
27-09-2019T15:48:19,TeapotOfDoom,so you mostly eyeball it?
27-09-2019T15:48:49,SageSaga,i have a decent sense of how it should work
27-09-2019T15:49:11,SageSaga,if you go back you'll see a mistake I made a lot not too long ago
27-09-2019T15:49:34,TeapotOfDoom,in artificial incident?
27-09-2019T15:49:42,SageSaga,and Yosh
27-09-2019T15:49:47,SageSaga,and even my commissions-
27-09-2019T15:50:33,SageSaga,depending on the lighting situation- you will often have a shadow cast on the body from the head
27-09-2019T15:51:16,SageSaga,but a lot of the shadows drawn are just a small shadow under the head on the neck
27-09-2019T15:51:28,SageSaga,which doesnt make much sense in many cased because of how big a human head is XD
27-09-2019T15:52:26,TeapotOfDoom,makes sense
27-09-2019T15:53:03,SageSaga,thing is- most people dont think about shadows as much as they think about light- because it's light- you see it more XD
27-09-2019T15:53:19,SageSaga,so missplaced or overblown highlights are a lot more obvious than shading
27-09-2019T15:54:19,AnuSekaniArt,Gotcha ^^
27-09-2019T15:54:52,SageSaga,for hair though- what im doing now is a quick way to do hair- yet its not as fast as some i like the look
27-09-2019T15:55:44,TeapotOfDoom,together with the blend effect (is it a brush? i dunno...) it looks really good
27-09-2019T15:56:22,SageSaga,the idea is to use these strokes to break up the hair so it looks like it can be more like strands
27-09-2019T15:56:36,SageSaga,then use the soft erase to add the more natural light on the hair
27-09-2019T15:56:59,AnuSekaniArt,So that's how you do hair XD
27-09-2019T15:58:27,SageSaga,i do it other ways too
27-09-2019T15:58:42,SageSaga,but this is a relatively fast way that works and has a good look to it
27-09-2019T15:59:10,SageSaga,and speed matters when you are doing 4 comics a week
27-09-2019T15:59:30,TeapotOfDoom,which is really impressive tbh
27-09-2019T16:00:01,AnuSekaniArt,Indeed
27-09-2019T16:01:36,SageSaga,hmm - power keeps going dim
27-09-2019T16:01:43,SageSaga,i might get DCed
27-09-2019T16:01:48,AnuSekaniArt,Oof
27-09-2019T16:02:20,SageSaga,brb gonna check to see if someone plugged in a power tool or something crazy
27-09-2019T16:02:29,AnuSekaniArt,OK
27-09-2019T16:03:16,TeapotOfDoom,DCed?
27-09-2019T16:05:18,SageSaga,im still here right?
27-09-2019T16:05:28,TeapotOfDoom,jup
27-09-2019T16:05:41,AnuSekaniArt,Ye
27-09-2019T16:06:59,SageSaga,so yeah- i was gonna say earlier- the more i interact with people the more I think the ability to come up with stories is more rare than people who can draw.
27-09-2019T16:07:18,AnuSekaniArt,Hah XD
27-09-2019T16:07:33,TeapotOfDoom,Ya think so?
27-09-2019T16:08:26,SageSaga,yeah- I thought it was the opposite before but- yeah i keep meeting people who claim to be writers because they cant draw and well- they cant write either
27-09-2019T16:08:39,TeapotOfDoom,In my humble experience creativity and especially coming up with ideas fast is a rare feature these days. not that people can't do it - they never learned how to
27-09-2019T16:10:10,SageSaga,"I find it very easy to create characters and stories, but i still see some veteran artist struggling with it"
27-09-2019T16:10:10,AnuSekaniArt,Yeah. Sad to say all my ideas tend to be rather derivative
27-09-2019T16:11:11,TeapotOfDoom,"depends what you are doing. I'm an engineer so everything i can reuse from somewhere else, i don't have to come up with"
27-09-2019T16:11:49,SageSaga,of course this thought is just a change in my current anecdotal opinion
27-09-2019T16:12:12,AnuSekaniArt,Engineer as well
27-09-2019T16:12:58,TeapotOfDoom,but yeah using music and graphic design as a kind of counterbalance coming up with something that's not derivative is still dificult if i don't go at it the right way which i mostly don't xD
27-09-2019T16:13:50,SageSaga,also - its fine to come up with derivative ideas and concepts so long as when you plan to use them in something you diversify it enough to make it your own.
27-09-2019T16:13:51,TeapotOfDoom,"the remix I'm doing right now is, well a remix, also the second part is kinda similar to a certain hardwell track"
27-09-2019T16:14:14,AnuSekaniArt,Don't really know if my ideas are like that. I leave that up to others
27-09-2019T16:16:14,SageSaga,something people keep thinking that really bugs me is that if something is similar to something that was done before- then it's not as good or it's just a copy
27-09-2019T16:16:53,SageSaga,it bothers me a lot because people will keep deconstructing stuff down further and further till you are looking at basic concepts and use that as proof
27-09-2019T16:17:09,TeapotOfDoom,true that
27-09-2019T16:17:17,SageSaga,"""Ha, so your character is a hero? Let me guess- they go  on the heroes journey? So predictable!"""
27-09-2019T16:18:18,AnuSekaniArt,There are only so many stories you can tell
27-09-2019T16:18:19,SageSaga,"""ha, your character learned from making a mistake? How predictable! So unoriginal!"""
27-09-2019T16:18:20,TeapotOfDoom,Coming up with something new in this context that actually works and is not just new for the sake of being something new is hard to impossible
27-09-2019T16:18:54,TeapotOfDoom,There is a genre called no input music
27-09-2019T16:18:56,SageSaga,"i disagree with the ""there are only so many stories you can tell"""
27-09-2019T16:19:06,TeapotOfDoom,^
27-09-2019T16:19:13,SageSaga,it only works when you deconstruct something to its base values
27-09-2019T16:19:20,TeapotOfDoom,ye
27-09-2019T16:19:28,SageSaga,"""man vs man, Man vs Nature, Man vs Self"""
27-09-2019T16:20:10,SageSaga,man in those does not refer to a male nor does it refer to a human
27-09-2019T16:20:46,TeapotOfDoom,so you take out keidrans?
27-09-2019T16:20:49,SageSaga,"""relative being"" might be a good way to put it"
27-09-2019T16:20:52,TeapotOfDoom,lol sry
27-09-2019T16:20:55,AnuSekaniArt,That's kinda what I was doing yeah. Which isn't the right way to go about it ^^;
27-09-2019T16:21:11,AnuSekaniArt,So yeah I agree with you Sage and Teapot
27-09-2019T16:22:08,SageSaga,"""There is an evil demon atop the mountain, you can make hundreds of ""hero"" characters to go fight it and each one can be interesting and different"
27-09-2019T16:22:35,SageSaga,and in anime half of those it turns out the evil demon is a hot chick
27-09-2019T16:22:35,TeapotOfDoom,why do i suddenly think of Deadpool now?
27-09-2019T16:22:48,TeapotOfDoom,true that lol
27-09-2019T16:22:50,AnuSekaniArt,Yeah I get ya
27-09-2019T16:23:29,TeapotOfDoom,yay just bounced the first version of the full arrangement ^^
27-09-2019T16:23:48,TeapotOfDoom,not fully happy with it yet but the general idea is finally there
27-09-2019T16:23:55,AnuSekaniArt,That's good ^^
27-09-2019T16:23:59,AnuSekaniArt,And thanks for the tips guys ^^
27-09-2019T16:24:41,TeapotOfDoom,also i wanna go out of my comfort zone in drawing
27-09-2019T16:25:12,TeapotOfDoom,i wanna try draw and then vectorize something instead of starting with a finished graphic
27-09-2019T16:26:09,AnuSekaniArt,I'm gonna finish up writing then get back to sketching
27-09-2019T16:43:44,FoxxTrotter,"Heading out to eat. Later, everyone. :0)"
27-09-2019T16:43:52,TeapotOfDoom,o/ Foxx
27-09-2019T16:45:06,AnuSekaniArt,Later Foxx!
27-09-2019T16:45:42,SageSaga,take care Foxx!
27-09-2019T16:45:54,SageSaga,im - done? i think?
27-09-2019T16:45:57,SageSaga,hmm
27-09-2019T16:46:09,SageSaga,Background could use some more work-
27-09-2019T16:46:37,SageSaga,I might need to draw an element
27-09-2019T16:46:50,AnuSekaniArt,Oh? LO
27-09-2019T16:46:54,AnuSekaniArt,:O
27-09-2019T16:47:58,SageSaga,hmmm
27-09-2019T16:48:41,TeapotOfDoom,Whadoyoumean by element?
27-09-2019T16:48:51,SageSaga,an object
27-09-2019T16:49:02,TeapotOfDoom,the thing behind the panels?
27-09-2019T16:49:02,SageSaga,that can be used over again for the background
27-09-2019T16:49:20,TeapotOfDoom,ah k. like an asset?
27-09-2019T16:49:27,SageSaga,yep
27-09-2019T17:00:51,SageSaga,this is still too complex for this- hmm
27-09-2019T17:00:57,SageSaga,i should look for a reference
27-09-2019T17:03:20,TeapotOfDoom,the tree idea looks good
27-09-2019T17:03:25,TeapotOfDoom,fits the theme
27-09-2019T17:05:17,SageSaga,im missing some brushes...
27-09-2019T17:05:55,TeapotOfDoom,just diappeared?
27-09-2019T17:07:33,SageSaga,nah must not have loaded them when i setup the new computer
27-09-2019T17:07:56,TeapotOfDoom,oh you upgraded?
