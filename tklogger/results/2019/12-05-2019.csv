12-05-2019T00:03:49,unsteddyphoenix,Oh hey dad
12-05-2019T00:04:01,unsteddyphoenix,You mean the glowy mew card?
12-05-2019T00:04:06,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah those were sick
12-05-2019T00:04:34,Dadrobit,"Yeah, and they did it for the Pikachu Detective one as well."
12-05-2019T00:05:03,SpazztasticKiwi,I just have two glowy cards. Ones entirely in Japanese and the other’s for Hoodoom
12-05-2019T00:05:20,Dadrobit,Got a Shiny Detective Pikachu card and a Jigglypuff
12-05-2019T00:05:47,Dadrobit,Houndoom*
12-05-2019T00:06:01,unsteddyphoenix,"Oh yo, thats dope"
12-05-2019T00:06:06,unsteddyphoenix,I wonder if we do that
12-05-2019T00:06:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Whatever he is. I’m likely donating them
12-05-2019T00:06:50,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t figure I’ll have use for em
12-05-2019T00:07:22,unsteddyphoenix,I also have no use for them
12-05-2019T00:07:27,unsteddyphoenix,But I still wannem gimme
12-05-2019T00:07:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also got some yugioh and yu yu hakusho cards, whatever those last ones are for"
12-05-2019T00:08:03,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d give them if I could. Especially if you want them
12-05-2019T00:08:15,SpazztasticKiwi,They’re not bent or damaged at all
12-05-2019T00:08:20,Dadrobit,"Same, I still have a small collection ~somewhere~ but I gotta probably go digging through storage to find em."
12-05-2019T00:10:32,SpazztasticKiwi,17 yugioh cards. I wonder why it was just a few of the three collections. Like they never bothered to actually collect
12-05-2019T00:10:58,SpazztasticKiwi,My sister has binders full of pokemon and yugioh
12-05-2019T00:13:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Anyway it was nice to see Mark resurface after his social media death of like 5 days. And Thomas posted the final “episode” of the bird family out his window as the babies flew away
12-05-2019T00:15:37,PotatoRights,"Wait, kiwi, twokinds thomas, or different thomas?"
12-05-2019T00:15:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Thomas Sanders
12-05-2019T00:16:01,PotatoRights,Oooohhhhh
12-05-2019T00:16:15,PotatoRights,"Yeah, he has good content"
12-05-2019T00:16:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"As a good rule, I just call Tom “Tom”"
12-05-2019T00:16:27,PotatoRights,Oh
12-05-2019T00:16:38,PotatoRights,Good point
12-05-2019T00:16:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Much like how I use Sage instead of Phil because there’s also Philip DeFranco
12-05-2019T00:17:31,PotatoRights,"And, if i remember correctly, theres also a potato chip username visiting the stream sometimes?"
12-05-2019T00:17:49,SpazztasticKiwi,I guess. Not really looked
12-05-2019T00:18:05,PotatoRights,Its been a while tho
12-05-2019T00:18:28,PotatoRights,I wonder if anyone remembers me on the stream?
12-05-2019T00:24:54,Dadrobit,"Blah, a little rain and the internet goes to shit. Cox's been cutting out all day..."
12-05-2019T00:25:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I didn’t know men had to connect that to the internet
12-05-2019T00:29:36,Dadrobit,"I was hoping to play a bit of EVE tonight, but that's not happening without a solid connection..."
12-05-2019T00:36:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Well if you get enough back and want to try something I found nearly killed me I got an interesting yt video. Though I warn it’s for older audiences
12-05-2019T00:37:33,Dadrobit,I think I'm older?
12-05-2019T00:37:37,Dadrobit,Pretty sure
12-05-2019T00:38:20,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s on the grapefruit technique if you know what that is. Reaction video
12-05-2019T00:38:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Doesn’t show anything I just found it golden
12-05-2019T00:39:21,Dadrobit,"Oh god, if it's what I think it it, I remember EXACTLY what you mean by older."
12-05-2019T00:39:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Then do you still want me to send?
12-05-2019T00:40:10,Dadrobit,"Sure, it's been a few years since that's graced my PC"
12-05-2019T00:41:39,SpazztasticKiwi,You’ll have a bit of disclaimer intro to go though at first but enjoy
12-05-2019T00:44:38,Dadrobit,Fuckin classic
12-05-2019T00:44:55,Dadrobit,Sounds like a cougar attack imo
12-05-2019T00:46:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I jumped when she started making that noise. Made me scared to ever approach a man that way for the rest if my life
12-05-2019T00:47:37,SpazztasticKiwi,daz has plenty of commentary similar. His reacts have me wheezing most of the time
12-05-2019T00:48:26,SpazztasticKiwi,“sounds like a seagull choking on its own vomit”
12-05-2019T01:03:35,SpazztasticKiwi,He’s got a legit fear of broken bones. Though he’s got two videos on it
12-05-2019T02:08:29,Twokinds,I've never broken a bone. Hope I never do.
12-05-2019T02:08:42,Bgrmystr2,"same, tom"
12-05-2019T02:10:20,Dadrobit,"Probably a good idea. As someone who's broken a lot of bones, lemme tell ya, it's not a great feeling."
12-05-2019T02:16:35,Twokinds,A lot?!
12-05-2019T02:16:39,Twokinds,Seems like a bad idea.
12-05-2019T02:19:44,Dadrobit,"Around a dozen or so. Some broken ribs too, dunno how to count them."
12-05-2019T02:20:16,Dadrobit,The moral of the story is that I'm great at bad ideas.
12-05-2019T02:20:28,unsteddyphoenix,Or bad at great ideas!
12-05-2019T02:20:41,Dadrobit,I like the way you think!
12-05-2019T02:21:38,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve broke one bone
12-05-2019T02:21:57,SpazztasticKiwi,And I kept trying to move my arm
12-05-2019T02:22:12,iliar,I thought all morning why Nora was doing so well. I think I know what the problem is. Legs disproportionately large. It doesn't look like feral dragon legs. It's more like anthro dragon legs.
12-05-2019T02:22:26,Dadrobit,It's been a while since I have. Last one was a few years ago and it wasn't even my fault. Dude sucker punched me and broke a cheekbone. That fuckin hurt lemme tell ya
12-05-2019T02:22:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Well I’m not sure it’s supposed to tickle
12-05-2019T02:23:11,SpazztasticKiwi,I broke my growth plate in my right arm. Cracked right down the middle
12-05-2019T02:23:18,iliar,And so I'm a little confused. I like the way it looks and I don’t want to change it. But I feel that this is not good for ref sheet.
12-05-2019T02:23:22,SpazztasticKiwi,All I did was fall over a dead log
12-05-2019T02:24:53,SpazztasticKiwi,"After it continued to hurt, which oddly enough was just a simple ach and not any kind of shooting pain, a few hours later we go to the er. And all they gave me was a splint because they “couldn’t diagnose broken bones on a minor”"
12-05-2019T02:26:04,Dadrobit,Adrenaline is a helluva drug. When I broke my back on my dirtbike I managed to get up and walk around for a bit. Thought I only broke a couple ribs. Whoops.
12-05-2019T02:26:10,SpazztasticKiwi,"The bone specialist the next day took one looks at that X-ray and just “ya, there’s the break”. Apparently it can be difficult to break that point. I’m special"
12-05-2019T02:26:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"If injured, stay. tf. still."
12-05-2019T02:27:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve seen plenty of broken bones vids where it’s like “just push it back” or the moron is sitting there waving the bendy part around
12-05-2019T02:27:54,Dadrobit,"Yeah, being a Boy Scout you'd think I'd know that. Turns out adrenaline's a helluva drug and it tells you to keep moving and get away from the danger."
12-05-2019T02:28:02,SpazztasticKiwi,"Sir, of your lower leg looks like a fishing rod, LEAVE IT"
12-05-2019T02:28:05,Dadrobit,Makes it hard when you ARE the danger
12-05-2019T02:29:10,Dadrobit,Didn't even think I was injured. Just a few broken ribs and a sprained ankle. I was 3 seconds from getting back on my bike and riding back to camp to have a lie down.
12-05-2019T02:29:20,SpazztasticKiwi,I will say a comment made on a gymnastics video. Girl landed between the legs on a balance beam and the reactor guy asked if women had vaginas made of kriptonite
12-05-2019T02:29:46,Dadrobit,I think he meant adamantium.
12-05-2019T02:30:04,SpazztasticKiwi,I found that way too funny but I’ve also done something similar. You bruise the absolute hell out of your legs and sometimes the pelvis
12-05-2019T02:30:05,Dadrobit,kriptonike was the Super Man thing
12-05-2019T02:30:12,SpazztasticKiwi,If you don’t break the pelvis
12-05-2019T02:31:14,SpazztasticKiwi,It hurts. You’re gonna be sore. But I will admit that the temporary is not often as bad as a mans as long as nothing breaks
12-05-2019T02:31:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Or vessels burst
12-05-2019T02:31:54,Twokinds,I guess it is a bit.
12-05-2019T02:32:03,SpazztasticKiwi,I slightly bruised the side of my pelvis. It’s not fun
12-05-2019T02:32:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Or actually it may have been just the skin that bruised
12-05-2019T02:33:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Not to mention those bones are tapered. Not very thick. And that kind of top impact can fracture and break them easily
12-05-2019T02:34:29,SpazztasticKiwi,"But as for my arm, it no longer bends up all the way and is weaker than my left"
12-05-2019T02:37:11,iliar,And one thing. Nora Ref looks good. What if I Nora Carded it and ask you make complete color art with detailed background? Like this https://www.patreon.com/posts/noras-fantasy-17907291
12-05-2019T02:37:19,iliar,Actually you already start create background.
12-05-2019T02:37:56,iliar,"And then you hide few layers, add text and gut ref sheet."
12-05-2019T02:38:14,SpazztasticKiwi,"Jesus that card. Every time, it’s like I need to cross myself"
12-05-2019T02:38:43,SpazztasticKiwi,I doo see your thing about the legs. Maybe give her a lil more thic
12-05-2019T02:39:20,Bgrmystr2,"There are certain places that would hurt more on there if you fell on it kiwi, but it's very small compared to men who just.. yeah. :u"
12-05-2019T02:39:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Big strong dragon legs gotta be enough to lift her up in takeoff and hold her weight
12-05-2019T02:40:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Yes. I realize. But for the sake of any who down in whoville being able to come across this conversation I decided I’d keep it more vanilla
12-05-2019T02:40:37,Bgrmystr2,fair enough. But know that at least I am in the know. You are not alone.
12-05-2019T02:40:43,SpazztasticKiwi,That and there’s a limit to how graphic you can go in this chat anyway
12-05-2019T02:41:32,SpazztasticKiwi,In a general conversation I’ve been known to surprise people by my frankness
12-05-2019T02:49:08,Twokinds,I suppose I could add a background if it was Nora Carded.
12-05-2019T02:54:10,unsteddyphoenix,But the precident...
12-05-2019T02:54:18,unsteddyphoenix,They'll ALL expect backgrounds :O
12-05-2019T02:56:18,unsteddyphoenix,Actually a background to that nora pic sounds good actually nvm
12-05-2019T03:00:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Just paint it all green and tell everyone “add it yourself”
12-05-2019T03:04:58,SpazztasticKiwi,The unfortunate part for feeding the snake: the crickets have the urge to cricket when I try to sleep
12-05-2019T03:07:33,SpazztasticKiwi,🛌
12-05-2019T03:11:28,iliar,No precedent.  Nora Card is a very powerful tool.  Nora Cards have already been used many times to add backgrounds.

12-05-2019T21:08:27,Twokinds,Wow that's light
12-05-2019T21:13:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Dude needs a burger
12-05-2019T21:13:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Or workout
12-05-2019T21:14:17,Bgrmystr2,what's the wiki's source on that weight though? How does it know?
12-05-2019T21:14:19,Bgrmystr2,"also, hi"
12-05-2019T21:14:30,FenceEqualizer,Really light considering he's slightly built. Going to blame the stress of Basitin Island
12-05-2019T21:15:19,FenceEqualizer,Maybe Tom said it at one point? I dun know I stop questioning the power of super fans and there information gathering since Marval comics

12-05-2019T21:38:28,Twokinds,I feel like maybe 160 might be more reasonable.
12-05-2019T21:38:51,Twokinds,150 - 160
12-05-2019T21:39:07,Bgrmystr2,"He may be scrawny, but he's a basitin. 160 seems way more reasonable for the muscle he's got hiding under that fur."
12-05-2019T21:39:17,Bgrmystr2,muscle weighs more than fat and takes less space.
12-05-2019T21:42:12,unsteddyphoenix,Basitins have to be dense in my mind
12-05-2019T21:42:16,unsteddyphoenix,Even denser than basitins
12-05-2019T21:42:20,unsteddyphoenix,*keidran
12-05-2019T21:42:40,unsteddyphoenix,So I think you're right. Maybe even a little heavier
12-05-2019T21:42:48,Bgrmystr2,Basitins. Denser than themselves - Phoenix 2019
12-05-2019T21:43:03,Bgrmystr2,Black holes confirmed.
12-05-2019T21:44:00,FenceEqualizer,"Heard it hear first folks, also 160 seems a lot more reasonable."
12-05-2019T21:44:44,unsteddyphoenix,Thats more basitin per basitin
12-05-2019T21:45:01,Dadrobit,There's a little basitin in all of us I think
12-05-2019T21:45:06,Dadrobit,"Also, howdy y'all."
12-05-2019T21:45:11,Bgrmystr2,"haha, some more than others"
12-05-2019T21:45:13,Bgrmystr2,hello
12-05-2019T21:46:53,Dadrobit,"Oh, and RIP another comic I was reading. Artist went AWOL and deleted most all their stuffs."
12-05-2019T21:46:59,Dadrobit,Trash Knight
12-05-2019T21:49:54,Dadrobit,"It's actually the worst wen folks do that. I get leaving art for one reason or another, but it sucks in the extreme when they decide to take everything with them."
12-05-2019T21:50:04,Dadrobit,when*
12-05-2019T21:50:17,Bgrmystr2,was that a recent thing or over the past few weeks thing?
12-05-2019T21:50:52,Dadrobit,Seems like it happened two weeks ago by the date of a comment someone made on their Patreon.
12-05-2019T21:51:39,Dadrobit,They stopped updating the comic about a month or so ago. Then a comment on the most recent page pointed me to the Patreon comment.
12-05-2019T21:51:52,Bgrmystr2,"the only thing I see is that they had an unplanned hiatus, and it was over as of march 22nd"
12-05-2019T21:52:52,Dadrobit,The hiatus remains. and their other art is still gone.
12-05-2019T21:53:31,Dadrobit,"comic is still up though, so there's that. But removing everything else while going radio silent does not bode well."
12-05-2019T21:53:33,Twokinds,I hate that!
12-05-2019T21:54:09,Bgrmystr2,:(
12-05-2019T21:59:09,SpazztasticKiwi,That reminds me I haven’t checked on my other art person
12-05-2019T22:11:18,FenceEqualizer,Wonder why they nuked their art. Maybe they wanted to hide their previous work. 🤔
12-05-2019T22:30:59,Dadrobit,"Alright, gonna head out for another exciting night of working as ""not a security officer."""
12-05-2019T22:31:08,Dadrobit,Have a good one y'all.
12-05-2019T22:34:58,FenceEqualizer,Night Robit
12-05-2019T22:39:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Have fun counting ceiling tiles
12-05-2019T22:54:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Either I saw a weird ass squirrel or that bunny in our driveway has problems
12-05-2019T22:55:35,Twokinds,I saw the albion squirrel this morning again
12-05-2019T23:00:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Yay
12-05-2019T23:01:02,SpazztasticKiwi,He live
12-05-2019T23:01:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Or she
12-05-2019T23:02:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Last night I saw a news snippet of someone recording a momma duck with guess how many babies in tow
12-05-2019T23:02:46,BadFoMo,20?
12-05-2019T23:03:02,SpazztasticKiwi,56. Not all were hers of course but Lord help me if I didn’t squeal like a dolphin
12-05-2019T23:03:33,BadFoMo,Dang!
12-05-2019T23:04:06,SpazztasticKiwi,All those lil tufts of ducky preciousness
12-05-2019T23:05:29,SpazztasticKiwi,irony is the fact I’ll gravitate towards baby anything but my own species
12-05-2019T23:07:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve also been thinking - and laughing - over those gymnastics fails still
12-05-2019T23:07:17,Twokinds,"Hm, I don't really have much to say about Keith"
12-05-2019T23:08:05,BadFoMo,"""Keith is... Keith. ...He's just Keith."""
12-05-2019T23:11:35,Twokinds,Yeah. Exactly.
12-05-2019T23:11:40,Twokinds,He's just a Keith.
12-05-2019T23:13:15,Twokinds,A lot of his background has already been covered in the comic itself.
12-05-2019T23:13:26,Twokinds,There isn't a lot of fun facts I can add.
12-05-2019T23:18:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe he hates the smell of sauerkraut
12-05-2019T23:18:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Just because
12-05-2019T23:21:24,Twokinds,Of course not.
12-05-2019T23:21:32,Twokinds,He's German.
12-05-2019T23:24:09,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s an idea. Really you can probably pull something out of the air
12-05-2019T23:24:29,SpazztasticKiwi,If you’re looking for fun tidbits
12-05-2019T23:25:44,Twokinds,I can't just make something up.
12-05-2019T23:25:47,Twokinds,What if it's not true?
12-05-2019T23:27:09,SpazztasticKiwi,You realize you’re the creator right
12-05-2019T23:27:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Go hogwild
12-05-2019T23:27:45,Twokinds,I only write it like I see it.
12-05-2019T23:28:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Does that sketch with Laura teaching Nat freaky bed stuff have any pull? That can be a “fun fact”
12-05-2019T23:28:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Though it might mess with the pg rating
12-05-2019T23:32:57,FenceEqualizer,Thought it was just an all basitins things. All that repressing they do.
12-05-2019T23:36:42,SpazztasticKiwi,"Other than that bad suggestion, what about just a simple favorite color"
12-05-2019T23:36:54,SpazztasticKiwi,“Natani’s eyes”
12-05-2019T23:38:51,SpazztasticKiwi,A little aw factor
