12-02-2019T15:14:57,Azumachan,Tom the nt.
12-02-2019T15:15:00,iliar,Two years is not very long. It amazes me more that all this time you keep a high rhythm.
12-02-2019T15:15:35,TerraTheWizard,7 sketches until 600
12-02-2019T15:16:35,iliar,New art every day. I do not know other artists who would have such a high productivity.
12-02-2019T15:16:45,TerraTheWizard,"200 patrons credited (unless i missed some that changed their name, then it might be less?)"
12-02-2019T15:17:08,TerraTheWizard,the number of unique names credited is somewhere around 208
12-02-2019T15:17:17,TerraTheWizard,i think
12-02-2019T15:18:38,Azumachan,Thanks~
12-02-2019T15:19:28,iliar,*cough*Although Nora Cards would like to done faster

12-02-2019T15:27:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Because I‚Äôm not completely heartless
12-02-2019T15:28:15,Azumachan,Tom if you need more info i should be here today.
12-02-2019T15:29:27,Twokinds,Yeah I've run into problems trying to redo the one with Flora and Kat
12-02-2019T15:29:30,SpazztasticKiwi,You just got lots to do. Rushings likely not gonna do anything but stress you out more üò∂
12-02-2019T15:29:41,Twokinds,But I'm hoping to overcome it and get that one done next after Marsh and iliar
12-02-2019T15:29:52,Twokinds,I've already finished almost two for Marsh
12-02-2019T15:30:00,Twokinds,MarshallMelon
12-02-2019T15:31:13,Azumachan,What about the Cuddles one ? (TT and Flora)
12-02-2019T15:32:16,Twokinds,I don't know that one

12-02-2019T15:36:33,Twokinds,That one's not on the list.
12-02-2019T15:39:10,Azumachan,Mmh
12-02-2019T15:39:59,Twokinds,What iliar does is helpful. It's just a google doc with the cards you want organized by month.
12-02-2019T15:40:09,Twokinds,"Not saying you have to do that, just that a list is handy."
12-02-2019T15:40:39,Azumachan,"That's true, I'd thought my ""bingo card"" would be better"
12-02-2019T15:40:49,Twokinds,The problem is you add things out of order
12-02-2019T15:41:02,Twokinds,And I can't tell how many cards have been fulfilled
12-02-2019T15:41:07,Azumachan,Sorry
12-02-2019T15:41:31,Azumachan,I use the DP link to check things
12-02-2019T15:42:08,Azumachan,I'll run a google doc if you prefer.

12-02-2019T15:42:40,Azumachan,Ok
12-02-2019T15:45:01,Azumachan,@iliar Do you mind sharing your list style to be homogeneous
12-02-2019T15:45:20,Azumachan,I don't know all the og names of the files and such
12-02-2019T15:46:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Ay you do got yourself some help. Get organized - Get ahead - Get it done ‚úÖ

12-02-2019T16:01:51,Azumachan,I don't mind the order for some  of them
12-02-2019T16:01:52,Twokinds,"I mean, you can tell me which one you want to do first, but I'd like them listed by month."
12-02-2019T16:02:12,Twokinds,Just organize them by month and then put a number by which one you want me to get to next.
