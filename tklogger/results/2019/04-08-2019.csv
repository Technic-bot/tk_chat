04-08-2019T02:54:33,AspiringNoodle,"booooooo, shitty horror movie, boooooooooooooooooooooo"
04-08-2019T02:54:48,AspiringNoodle,Shitty horror movie with a god damned mary sue of a monster
04-08-2019T02:55:52,AspiringNoodle,Before anyone asks
04-08-2019T02:56:04,AspiringNoodle,Squid like creature with the following properties
04-08-2019T02:57:25,AspiringNoodle,"Flexible body. Apparently bullet proof (caught rifle rounds with its body, I call bull on that, or the gun was just crappy in general).  Survived being electrocuted and set on fire."
04-08-2019T02:58:22,AspiringNoodle,"Parasitic in nature.  Can take control of hosts.  In addition to the squishy / flexible body that's able to catch bullets, it's squid tentacles are also sturdy enough to completely impale victims through their sternum"
04-08-2019T02:58:46,AspiringNoodle,All this in addition to the fact that the thing is smaller than a human head :/

04-08-2019T05:26:31,Bgrmystr2,@iliar just FYI the normal speed recording you took has broken audio after like 1 second.
04-08-2019T05:26:34,Bgrmystr2,for the rest of the video.
04-08-2019T05:31:34,iliar,"Oh ... I looked at the video track, but did not pay attention to the sound."
04-08-2019T05:31:45,iliar,I'll try to fix it
04-08-2019T05:34:48,Bgrmystr2,:thumbsup:

04-08-2019T16:10:32,TeapotOfDoom,how big is big
04-08-2019T16:11:18,AspiringNoodle,It takes me 1.5 - 2 hours depending on how fast I feel like going
04-08-2019T16:11:25,AspiringNoodle,And whether or not the grass is a jungle
04-08-2019T16:12:13,AspiringNoodle,"And because of the ridiculous terrain in some areas as well as some landscaping choices, there are parts I HAVE to use a push mower for"
04-08-2019T16:12:18,AspiringNoodle,So that's 30 minutes or so
04-08-2019T16:13:23,TeapotOfDoom,but that means you have one of these sit on and drive around things
04-08-2019T16:14:18,Orthonox,So do not feel bad for thinking like this.
04-08-2019T16:29:43,TeapotOfDoom,i am violently tired

04-08-2019T19:07:54,SomeNiceUser,Makes sense.

04-08-2019T19:09:47,SomeNiceUser,I myself am looking for a laptop with a AMD Ryzen core.
04-08-2019T19:09:53,CrRAR,(not exactly half the price though)
04-08-2019T19:10:30,CrRAR,iPadOS is adding some nice features though.
04-08-2019T19:11:03,CrRAR,Makes the iPad Pros especially more functional.
04-08-2019T19:11:42,SomeNiceUser,That’s good.
04-08-2019T19:12:01,SomeNiceUser,But those are getting very expensive.
04-08-2019T19:14:53,Dadrobit,Got a refurb Dell Inspirion 5577 last year. Had to replace it once because it shipped with dead pixels and kept blue screening. But the second one I got has been working perfectly so far.
04-08-2019T19:16:04,Dadrobit,"i7770, 16 gigs DDR4, and a GTX 1050. Only thing not great is working on a laptop screen."
04-08-2019T19:16:30,Ordithus,That's what connecting it to a monitor is for!
04-08-2019T19:16:44,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-maddiessparkles:
04-08-2019T19:17:10,Dadrobit,That connection goes into my vocal booth so I can read the scripts in there.
04-08-2019T19:22:13,SomeNiceUser,But what I need is a Ryzen so I can use multiple programs no sweat.
04-08-2019T19:26:48,SomeNiceUser,"I currently have an eye on the Acer Nitro 5, but the dell Inspiron 7375 2 in 1 looks also very good."
04-08-2019T19:32:13,SomeNiceUser,But the prices are expensive. So I should try to find some refurbished ones.
04-08-2019T19:46:50,Dadrobit,"I'd be careful with a Ryzen laptop. First gen Ryzen performance is heavily affected by how fast your RAM is, and laptops tend to skimp out in that area."
04-08-2019T19:48:13,CrRAR,"dadrobit, teller of wisdom~"
04-08-2019T19:48:55,Bgrmystr2,there's actually a few ways around the ram speed to get similar performance
04-08-2019T19:48:56,SomeNiceUser,So what is the optimal RAM for a Ryzen laptop Robit?
04-08-2019T19:49:23,Bgrmystr2,there's a video on Linus Tech Tips recently posted about how to get similar performance to ram that has the higher speeds
04-08-2019T19:50:05,Bgrmystr2,which has I think at least two alternative ways to get almost as much performance as you'd get from 3600
04-08-2019T19:50:12,CrRAR,Does this involve the channeling of the RAM or is it how the CPU sets it's clock speed based on RAM?
04-08-2019T19:50:28,Dadrobit,"Though looking around, it seems like the 2500U in that laptop is capped at 2400MHz anyways."
04-08-2019T19:50:57,Bgrmystr2,Linus was able to get 1600 speed to perform almost as well as 3600
04-08-2019T19:51:03,Bgrmystr2,"like, within a few percent"
04-08-2019T19:51:15,CrRAR,nice
04-08-2019T19:51:39,Dadrobit,"You might be able to find SODIMMs with better latency, but the 2500U is limited to just 2400MHz"
04-08-2019T19:52:17,Bgrmystr2,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHJ16hD4ysk it's a good watch. Granted it's all on desktop, but the same alternative things he does with the ram speeds should easily be done on a laptop as well"
04-08-2019T19:52:43,CrRAR,The advice I always tell people is to make sure you occupy both sides of the RAM channels otherwise you're reducing overall throughput depending on how channeled your m/b is.
04-08-2019T19:52:44,Bgrmystr2,since it's about editing things in the bios or editing things via a program in your OS which controls your ram
04-08-2019T19:52:55,CrRAR,interesting
04-08-2019T19:53:44,Bgrmystr2,it's super technical too
04-08-2019T19:53:51,Dadrobit,I just watched that earlier. Definitely one of his more technical videos. I've been around for a while and that video had me rewinding more than a few times to get it all.
04-08-2019T19:53:56,Dadrobit,yep
04-08-2019T19:54:48,Bgrmystr2,"I fiigured if anything, a laptop should be able to get at least pretty good performance from the ram in it even if it's not THAT good simply due to alternative measures"
04-08-2019T19:54:51,CrRAR,Yeah it's all about the FSB ratios. FSB of course got mangled over the years when they relocated the memory controllers.
04-08-2019T19:55:08,CrRAR,It became more dependent of the CPU clock.
04-08-2019T19:55:24,CrRAR,Which made things complicated.
04-08-2019T19:55:40,CrRAR,but things ARE crazy faster these days soooo
04-08-2019T19:55:54,CrRAR,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
04-08-2019T19:57:06,CrRAR,"I think that was the benefit of ""unlocked"" CPUs... because you could change the typically hardwired multiplier."
04-08-2019T19:57:40,CrRAR,"Without messing with the actual CPU speed, which would make for an easily adjustable FSB."
04-08-2019T19:58:06,CrRAR,...and memory clocks.
04-08-2019T19:59:23,CrRAR,Unlock all the gigaflops.
04-08-2019T20:09:13,CrRAR,"Ah so, ""infinity fabric"" is just AMD's FSB basically. makes sense."
