26-01-2019T01:30:59,NibblyBot,New Comic Page: Behind the Door http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/1054/
26-01-2019T01:32:30,Bgrmystr2,"Ah, the N in that top right panel was cut off"
26-01-2019T01:32:43,unsteddyphoenix,oh yeah it was
26-01-2019T01:32:46,Bgrmystr2,more than that actually
26-01-2019T01:32:55,Bgrmystr2,the 2nd bubble has letters on the left side cut off as well
26-01-2019T01:33:49,Twokinds,weird the file didn't save properly
26-01-2019T01:33:59,Twokinds,Never seen that before
26-01-2019T01:34:06,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah thats pretty odd
26-01-2019T01:34:58,Bgrmystr2,least it's an east fix
26-01-2019T01:35:01,Bgrmystr2,easy* even
26-01-2019T01:36:10,Twokinds,Fixed
26-01-2019T01:36:21,Bgrmystr2,"huh, just noticing the 2nd panel, roses first line is cut at the top as well.."
26-01-2019T01:36:41,Bgrmystr2,no nvm it's fixed
26-01-2019T01:37:13,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-rose:
26-01-2019T01:37:44,unsteddyphoenix,Yup now it looks correct!
26-01-2019T01:37:51,unsteddyphoenix,And extremely foreboding!
26-01-2019T01:38:01,Bgrmystr2,Trace's inner evil is not happy
26-01-2019T01:38:03,Twokinds,"Otherwise, what do you think?"
26-01-2019T01:38:26,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-nataniAAAAshake::ptv-left:
26-01-2019T01:38:30,Bgrmystr2,I think this is definitely going to solidify Rose's trust in this new Trace that he's really who he says he is.
26-01-2019T01:38:39,unsteddyphoenix,Turned out well! Was worried it was gonna be overcrowded but it ended up working
26-01-2019T01:38:44,Bgrmystr2,cuz the original Trace would never have done that
26-01-2019T01:38:46,unsteddyphoenix,I should really have more faith
26-01-2019T01:39:03,Bgrmystr2,"also, I do not like this door.."
26-01-2019T01:39:19,Bgrmystr2,I've seen enough internet to know where that's going.
26-01-2019T01:39:21,Ordithus,What secrets were hidden
26-01-2019T01:39:44,unsteddyphoenix,Is it just me or does that shadow seem to have hair like traces?
26-01-2019T01:39:49,Bgrmystr2,it actually looks kind of like trace's hairstyle yeah
26-01-2019T01:39:54,Bgrmystr2,was just typing that
26-01-2019T01:40:15,Bgrmystr2,it's missing his hair that sticks up at the top though
26-01-2019T01:40:18,Ordithus,"Or Brahn, maybe.  But I would be surprised"
26-01-2019T01:40:23,Bgrmystr2,did he have that when he was evil templar..?
26-01-2019T01:40:41,unsteddyphoenix,That wouldve m ade it too obvious
26-01-2019T01:41:27,Bgrmystr2,I mean yeah but I would think perhaps it was not there because it is someone else..?
26-01-2019T01:41:29,Bgrmystr2,I'm not sure.
26-01-2019T01:41:59,Ordithus,Rose petals and the... ropes or whatever
26-01-2019T01:42:08,SpazztasticKiwi,I see we have the new page
26-01-2019T01:42:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Can only see everything from about 10 minutes ago though. Nice
26-01-2019T01:44:04,unsteddyphoenix,tentacles.
26-01-2019T01:44:08,unsteddyphoenix,Evil black magic tentacles
26-01-2019T01:44:22,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock::ptv-ohmy:
26-01-2019T01:44:24,unsteddyphoenix,Which I feel liek Trace has used before during his freakouts
26-01-2019T01:44:36,SpazztasticKiwi,"Hopefully in the future, Trace splits: light and dark. Then we can give the dark one a boom cake"
26-01-2019T01:45:01,Ordithus,"Black tentacles of death is a Trace move, yeah"
26-01-2019T01:45:13,Ordithus,"Used it on that guy in the town way back, and on the Basitin Isles"
26-01-2019T01:45:43,unsteddyphoenix,ye ye!
26-01-2019T01:45:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Why dark tentacles? What happened to a good ol knife fight
26-01-2019T01:45:55,unsteddyphoenix,"I wonder if this is where traces ""memories"" are"
26-01-2019T01:46:04,unsteddyphoenix,All the tentacles are holding knives
26-01-2019T01:46:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Two hands maximum
26-01-2019T01:46:30,Bgrmystr2,":thinking: that makes the most sense, if the room he's not supposed to go in is where the memories are held.. but I'm fairly sure he still has them, they're just blocked."
26-01-2019T01:46:38,SpazztasticKiwi,And they gotta have fingers
26-01-2019T01:46:51,unsteddyphoenix,racist to octopi
26-01-2019T01:46:54,Ordithus,":ctwokinds-katwet:*[Hey, Maddie, have you seen a towel anywhere?  All I've found is rope]"
26-01-2019T01:46:57,Bgrmystr2,"cuz if he didn't actually have his memories on him, and they were elsewhere, then he wouldn't have evil trace going behind his back trying to ruin things."
26-01-2019T01:47:02,SpazztasticKiwi,So he just now post this a second ago? What all EXACTLY did I miss
26-01-2019T01:47:02,Bgrmystr2,but he does.
26-01-2019T01:47:53,Bgrmystr2,"yeah it was posted a little bit ago, and then there were some text cutoffs, so he fixed em."
26-01-2019T01:48:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Ya saw that. Tech be funny
26-01-2019T01:48:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Despite being “modern”
26-01-2019T01:48:31,Ordithus,Was a weird glitch
26-01-2019T01:48:39,unsteddyphoenix,"Unless...what's in his head isnt ""evil trace""!!! :O"
26-01-2019T01:49:09,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s really just a salty child ego that never got hugged
26-01-2019T01:50:21,unsteddyphoenix,teen angst black smoke
26-01-2019T01:50:33,SpazztasticKiwi,“It’s not a phase mom”
26-01-2019T01:50:50,DarthRexKing,Night!
26-01-2019T01:50:58,Ordithus,"""But mooooom, I don't want to take over the world"""
26-01-2019T01:51:55,SpazztasticKiwi,"Though. If Trace is what, 24..? It’s either his enough phase coming late or an early mid life crisis"
26-01-2019T01:52:08,SpazztasticKiwi,emo
26-01-2019T01:52:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Or maybe stress. It’s enough to turn anyone into a murdering entity of the night
26-01-2019T01:54:21,Ordithus,"Tom is probably chuckling to himself ""They have no idea!"""
26-01-2019T01:54:54,DarthRexKing,Of course he does. He would not leave a TRACE of what he is up to. :V
26-01-2019T01:54:58,DarthRexKing,YEEEEAAAAAAAAH!
26-01-2019T01:55:02,DarthRexKing,*CSI Glasses.*
26-01-2019T01:55:11,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-keifacepalm:
26-01-2019T01:55:18,Bgrmystr2,"you could be right, phoenix. but the people who removed his memories wanted him gone anyway. So why would they leave an out, or leave something other than his memories if they didn't want him to have a chance of returning..?"
26-01-2019T01:55:28,Bgrmystr2,I'm not sure what they would gain from that
26-01-2019T01:55:59,DarthRexKing,Maybe they have alternative plans for what kind of LEGACY he will leave behind.
26-01-2019T01:56:02,DarthRexKing,YEEEAAAAAAAH!
26-01-2019T01:56:11,Bgrmystr2,"much theory, many confuse. wow. :ptv-wondering:"
26-01-2019T01:56:36,DarthRexKing,Leaves much room for a  BGR MYSTR-y does it?
26-01-2019T01:56:40,DarthRexKing,YEEEEAAAAAAAH!
26-01-2019T01:56:49,unsteddyphoenix,"Hard to say WHAT they want, really. Maybe they have a 400IQ 134 step program to get their planws"
26-01-2019T01:56:52,Bgrmystr2,har har heard that one before.
26-01-2019T01:56:53,unsteddyphoenix,Or maybe theyre just messing around
26-01-2019T01:56:55,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-unimpressed:
26-01-2019T01:57:20,DarthRexKing,Hmmmm. the idea of that does leave me UNSTEDDY in mind.
26-01-2019T01:57:23,DarthRexKing,YEEAAAAAH!
26-01-2019T01:57:29,Bgrmystr2,are you done lol
26-01-2019T01:57:29,SpazztasticKiwi,As for the story. Rose lived through his bad phase. Maybe she’s something he’s afraid of - if she was blocked from whatever we’re about to se
26-01-2019T01:58:09,DarthRexKing,I am going to see how long I do this before someone SPAZZes out.
26-01-2019T01:58:12,DarthRexKing,YEEEAAAAAAH!
26-01-2019T01:58:14,Bgrmystr2,Do we know for sure if Rose knows what's in that room behind the lizardbro
26-01-2019T01:58:18,Ordithus,"Yo, that can stop now"
26-01-2019T01:58:22,DarthRexKing,>W>
26-01-2019T01:58:31,SpazztasticKiwi,I will block you
26-01-2019T01:58:35,DarthRexKing,X3
26-01-2019T01:58:44,Bgrmystr2,"it won't stop him, kiwi"
26-01-2019T01:58:47,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s a reason. Question is if it’s because he was that secretive or didn’t want her messing with it
26-01-2019T01:58:48,Bgrmystr2,bandaids.
26-01-2019T01:59:06,Ordithus,Dem dark Templar secrets
26-01-2019T01:59:12,DarthRexKing,:V
26-01-2019T01:59:22,Ordithus,Machinations of his plots to do evil
26-01-2019T01:59:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Or something else entirely
26-01-2019T01:59:52,Bgrmystr2,"Tom's probably over there reading this chat like.. ""Just according to Keikaku"" :ptv-snicker:"
26-01-2019T02:00:00,SpazztasticKiwi,"I wonder though. How open was his wife to this, was she blocked from that area?"
26-01-2019T02:00:01,Ordithus,His unsavory hobby of fine art?
26-01-2019T02:00:14,Ordithus,I suspect this is post-Saria
26-01-2019T02:00:33,Bgrmystr2,yeah it was probably post-Saria
26-01-2019T02:00:42,Ordithus,Her death is what drove him into madness
26-01-2019T02:00:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Welp
26-01-2019T02:00:54,Ordithus,"Well, drove him to trying dark mana"
26-01-2019T02:00:56,Bgrmystr2,cuz that was what pushed him deep into the dark magic
26-01-2019T02:01:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe flora is the cure
26-01-2019T02:01:00,Bgrmystr2,to return her to life
26-01-2019T02:01:01,Ordithus,Which made him go cray-cray
26-01-2019T02:01:33,SpazztasticKiwi,🎼 keeeeep moving forward 🎶
26-01-2019T02:01:35,DarthRexKing,"I agree. Anakin losing Padame was the breaking point. . . . . .wait, wrong darksider who lost a loved one."
26-01-2019T02:02:12,SpazztasticKiwi,So Trace has the dream of being a necromancer
26-01-2019T02:02:20,SpazztasticKiwi,"Or as I’d say, a really late healer"
26-01-2019T02:02:31,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-keith8D:
26-01-2019T02:02:41,Bgrmystr2,"Or is someone that created an evil hat, Kiwi?"
26-01-2019T02:03:08,SpazztasticKiwi,If that’s a reference you lost me
26-01-2019T02:03:27,Bgrmystr2,"I guess your ""Keep moving forward"" was not the reference I thought it was."
26-01-2019T02:03:38,SpazztasticKiwi,It was meet the robinsons
26-01-2019T02:03:42,Bgrmystr2,yeah
26-01-2019T02:03:44,Bgrmystr2,with the evil hat.
26-01-2019T02:03:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Bowling hat guy
26-01-2019T02:03:58,Bgrmystr2,Yeah
26-01-2019T02:04:03,SpazztasticKiwi,I have a big head. And little arms
26-01-2019T02:04:04,DarthRexKing,". . . . . . . .If I commission Tom some day, it will be a star wars parody with trace and his future off spring in starwars-esque scene. But I do not if it will be a boy, girl, or twins. .w."
26-01-2019T02:04:15,SpazztasticKiwi,I got it now. It’s 1 am
26-01-2019T02:04:19,Bgrmystr2,lool
26-01-2019T02:04:26,Bgrmystr2,"Been a bit since you saw it, eh?"
26-01-2019T02:04:38,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
26-01-2019T02:04:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Just a hair
26-01-2019T02:04:44,Ordithus,Goodnight Tom!
26-01-2019T02:04:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Night again tom
26-01-2019T02:04:46,Bgrmystr2,ohey tom

26-01-2019T02:04:53,unsteddyphoenix,night Tom~
26-01-2019T02:04:56,DarthRexKing,"You got what, Spazz? The time?"
26-01-2019T02:04:57,Bgrmystr2,lots of theorycrafting on this one
26-01-2019T02:04:59,DarthRexKing,Night Tom
26-01-2019T02:05:09,DarthRexKing,And pun crafting.
26-01-2019T02:05:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Not gonna stay with us? Join the talk
26-01-2019T02:05:31,Bgrmystr2,"she got the reference, unlike which could be said for other people here Drex"
26-01-2019T02:05:55,SpazztasticKiwi,"Hour late to bed, though. Don’t want to mess that schedule up"
26-01-2019T02:06:29,SpazztasticKiwi,We’ll churn the theories while you’re away then
26-01-2019T02:06:47,DarthRexKing,"There are TWO KINDS of people. The sleepers and the night owls, I am not the latter. I am going to bed. Goodnight everyone, and that is the last pun. . . . .Until next time."
26-01-2019T02:06:55,DarthRexKing,:smiling_imp:
26-01-2019T02:07:09,Ordithus,Bye DRK
26-01-2019T02:07:11,Bgrmystr2,"rip the 3rd kind of people, the vampires."
26-01-2019T02:07:16,DarthRexKing,:V
26-01-2019T02:07:17,Bgrmystr2,"and the 4th kind of people, the robots"
26-01-2019T02:07:22,Ordithus,"They're already dead, Bgr"
26-01-2019T02:07:39,DarthRexKing,But what about the close encounters of the 4th kind? o3o
26-01-2019T02:07:42,Bgrmystr2,..and all the attack helicopter people too. They were good lads. :ptv-sad:
26-01-2019T02:07:48,DarthRexKing,O3O
26-01-2019T02:07:55,DarthRexKing,Later all!
26-01-2019T02:08:02,Bgrmystr2,gnight then
26-01-2019T02:08:04,DarthRexKing,\o.o/
26-01-2019T02:08:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Robots? Dead? How insensitive of you
26-01-2019T02:08:18,Bgrmystr2,Don't ask me
26-01-2019T02:08:20,Ordithus,They aren't alive
26-01-2019T02:08:28,Bgrmystr2,that means they can't die either
26-01-2019T02:10:01,SpazztasticKiwi,The new stuffs lookin good. Getting lots ‘o cinematic lighting lately
26-01-2019T02:10:37,Ordithus,That wall is coming out of the lizard's cookie salary
26-01-2019T02:11:14,SpazztasticKiwi,"And looking at said lizard, I want to see him as a wingless dragon or related to the dragons"
26-01-2019T02:12:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Cause have we seen a guy dragon? Where’d ol Stony come from?
26-01-2019T02:12:51,Ordithus,A bunch of rocks or dirt
26-01-2019T02:13:04,Ordithus,Made him out of clay
26-01-2019T02:13:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Is he something or someone Trace cursed? Or just a statue given the enchantment of random bodily spasms when someone touched that handle
26-01-2019T02:13:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Trace’s first grade clay sculpture class project
26-01-2019T02:13:56,SpazztasticKiwi,"His, ahem, pet rock"
26-01-2019T02:14:15,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-sadtrace2:*[Teacher gave me a B-]
26-01-2019T02:14:31,SpazztasticKiwi,At least it’s a B
26-01-2019T02:15:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Person next to him did a recreation of Michaelangelo and got a C
26-01-2019T02:15:55,Ordithus,It wasn't very original
26-01-2019T02:16:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I believe the teacher having cataracts had a hand in it
26-01-2019T02:17:15,SpazztasticKiwi,I meant “recreation” as a sculpture of Michelangelo
26-01-2019T02:17:40,Ordithus,Ah
26-01-2019T02:17:41,SpazztasticKiwi,And I believe that gives me an idea for a sketch
26-01-2019T02:17:49,Ordithus,Oh?
26-01-2019T02:18:20,SpazztasticKiwi,How ok you think Tom would be with a Mona Lisa sketch
26-01-2019T02:18:26,Ordithus,haha
26-01-2019T02:18:46,SpazztasticKiwi,But with Maren or something
26-01-2019T02:18:56,Ordithus,Ok now I'm listening
26-01-2019T02:19:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Cause she has that “is that a smile or what’s going on there” look
26-01-2019T02:19:29,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-eyeroll: she can pull it off
26-01-2019T02:20:00,Bgrmystr2,Maren Lisa? :O
26-01-2019T02:20:24,SpazztasticKiwi,The painting labeled was really bad at spelling
26-01-2019T02:20:29,SpazztasticKiwi,labeler
26-01-2019T02:21:31,RimaDraws,lol
26-01-2019T02:22:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I may actually try that. But I don’t know if Tom can draw Mona Lisa
26-01-2019T02:22:17,Ordithus,"I know one more Maren than Mona, so I can see it.  ""Hmm, can't remember.  Starts with an M"""
26-01-2019T02:23:10,SpazztasticKiwi,For one it’s a painting. And a famous one. A headache to try probably so..
26-01-2019T02:23:59,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s either that or another tarot
26-01-2019T02:24:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Which don’t appear to be any kind of popular
26-01-2019T02:25:30,Ordithus,I will try to come up with something featuring someone we don't see much of
26-01-2019T02:25:52,Ordithus,"Like Sealeen, or Sirius"
26-01-2019T02:26:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Why so Sirius
26-01-2019T02:26:53,RimaDraws,pfft
26-01-2019T02:27:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Had too. Immediately read it in my head and couldn’t resist
26-01-2019T02:27:20,Ordithus,:csagesaga-nynasmirk:*[wanna know how you got these scars?]
26-01-2019T02:27:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh the response I’d like to say
26-01-2019T02:27:42,SpazztasticKiwi,...
26-01-2019T02:29:09,SpazztasticKiwi,I wonder if Picarto saves chats
26-01-2019T02:29:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Can you go somewhere and look back to parts that get covered or is it actually gone forever in the sake of space
26-01-2019T02:30:14,Bgrmystr2,there's a limit to what picarto saves
26-01-2019T02:30:17,Bgrmystr2,the rest is local.
26-01-2019T02:30:32,Bgrmystr2,"so when you reload the page fresh and you only see about 5 or so mins of chat, maybe less"
26-01-2019T02:30:35,Bgrmystr2,that's what picarto saves
26-01-2019T02:31:00,SpazztasticKiwi,And yet it still sucks at function often
26-01-2019T02:31:11,SpazztasticKiwi,👏🏻 good job
26-01-2019T02:31:18,SpazztasticKiwi,You tried ⭐️
26-01-2019T02:31:24,Bgrmystr2,"and all the 3 or 4 hours of stream chat you can scroll through is all gonna be saved locally in your history, but if you refresh, it disappears cuz picarto replaces your local chat cache with what is currently live."
26-01-2019T02:32:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m on the app. It refreshes each time I return and stuff disappears as it goes even if I stay
26-01-2019T02:32:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Scroll limit
26-01-2019T02:32:41,Bgrmystr2,yeah that's probably an app limit
26-01-2019T02:32:55,Ordithus,It gets real weird when the chat disconnects and reconnects
26-01-2019T02:32:55,Bgrmystr2,"on the desktop, I get several hours of chat"
26-01-2019T02:33:27,Bgrmystr2,"yeah when the chat disconnects and reconnects, it auto-fills the bottom of the chat with a copypaste of what is currently live up to what picarto saves"
26-01-2019T02:33:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"On webpage, there’s a bigger, if one, limit"
26-01-2019T02:33:52,Bgrmystr2,so sometimes it's a bunch of comments.. then a repeat of the same comments without any kind of notice that the chat disconnected
26-01-2019T02:33:53,Ordithus,I can see all the way back to 7:38pm central
26-01-2019T02:34:29,SpazztasticKiwi,But religion ading it web wise logs me off just about every time
26-01-2019T02:34:35,SpazztasticKiwi,reloading
26-01-2019T02:34:43,Bgrmystr2,my chat goes back to 14:18 so..
26-01-2019T02:34:52,Bgrmystr2,so 2:18pm
26-01-2019T02:34:52,Ordithus,What a strange autocorrect
26-01-2019T02:34:54,Bgrmystr2,central
26-01-2019T02:35:04,Ordithus,I had closed the tab
26-01-2019T02:35:16,Bgrmystr2,"I didn't, so mine is the maximum"
26-01-2019T02:35:59,Bgrmystr2,"strangely enough, the message after that is one from sage at 17:39"
26-01-2019T02:36:11,Bgrmystr2,seems like the one at 14:18 is stuck.
26-01-2019T02:36:24,Ordithus,Could be a glitch
26-01-2019T02:36:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I get the last bits when I leave and a jump cut to some recent
26-01-2019T02:37:10,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, so 5:39pm is actually where my chat stops. a few mins more than 8 hours ago."
26-01-2019T02:37:22,Ordithus,"Anyhow, I am tired"
26-01-2019T02:37:28,Bgrmystr2,"but it's not time-bound, it's bound by the number of messages."
26-01-2019T02:37:30,Ordithus,Goodnight! :ctwokinds-RainezZz:
26-01-2019T02:37:34,Bgrmystr2,goodnight ord :)
26-01-2019T02:37:42,SpazztasticKiwi,But now it’s showing doubles and the reload jump
26-01-2019T02:37:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Since I’ve been on
26-01-2019T02:39:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I see my 23:58 line then it goes to Steddy’s 00:32 line. And then it repeats some bits
26-01-2019T02:58:44,SpazztasticKiwi,"So I missed maybe two or five lines. But here’s a thing: are the memories removed, spot removed (some parts are still there but out of immediate thinking reach), or blocked"
26-01-2019T03:00:27,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
26-01-2019T03:00:32,Bgrmystr2,Trace's memories?
26-01-2019T03:00:35,Bgrmystr2,hmm
26-01-2019T03:00:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Yea
26-01-2019T03:00:43,Bgrmystr2,that is a good question
26-01-2019T03:01:06,Bgrmystr2,"cuz if that is a history of his memories, it might be a replication of himself just in case something bad happened?"
26-01-2019T03:01:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Cause maybe whatever they did they did cause he was getting scary to them (uprooting plans or causing too much destruction even for bad guys)
26-01-2019T03:01:47,Bgrmystr2,yeah I don't think it's a complete removal of his memories cuz he wouldn't have evil guy talkin to him
26-01-2019T03:02:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"Or because he was or is, most likely, stronger even with out dark help and they want him to take a long walk off a short pier"
26-01-2019T03:02:18,Bgrmystr2,"the only other thing is that if it is his memories removed entirely, they would have had to put some new evil thing into his head.."
26-01-2019T03:02:26,Bgrmystr2,but that seems super roundabout
26-01-2019T03:03:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Jimmy the intern is in trouble of this dark voice ends up helping Trace return and fix everything rather than keeping him away
26-01-2019T03:03:31,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno.. The memories thing makes the most sense, but I doubt it's all of it cuz evil trace wouldn't be trying to claw back control lol xD"
26-01-2019T03:03:54,SpazztasticKiwi,"Cause if it was to veer him away from remembering, some people have the trait to do the thing their little voice says to leave alone"
26-01-2019T03:07:20,SpazztasticKiwi,"I want to say it’s blocked but because Trace is stronger, again, likely stronger without this dark corruption help, they were only able to block stuff. And that voice is what they couldn’t"
26-01-2019T03:08:13,SpazztasticKiwi,And what’s in that room is apparently the pull cord to unravel the block - or remind Trace of everything as well as weave that voice
26-01-2019T03:08:19,SpazztasticKiwi,erase
26-01-2019T03:09:09,Bgrmystr2,possibly.
26-01-2019T03:09:11,Bgrmystr2,that would make sense
26-01-2019T03:11:03,SpazztasticKiwi,So the voice could also be part of a sort of door keeper for the memories. Both from the placed block and the darkness’s reluctance/fear of being removed
26-01-2019T03:12:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom get back here I got questions
26-01-2019T03:16:02,Bgrmystr2,tom is sleeping please leave all messages to never be read in the chat after the beep

26-01-2019T03:33:24,SpazztasticKiwi,We’ll find out eventually anyway so..
26-01-2019T03:38:37,SpazztasticKiwi,I believe I’m gonna become one with my pillow here soon
26-01-2019T03:39:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe I’ll be back. Maybe not. Depends on if I can get to sleep

26-01-2019T20:06:13,FoxxTrotter,"Oh, I can find cassette tapes at some stores up north."

26-01-2019T20:06:39,MviluUatusun,"Wow, Foxx.  And I thought my hometown was out of touch."
26-01-2019T20:06:41,Bgrmystr2,I'm listening to two streams at once.
26-01-2019T20:06:45,microbuss,"ORL, Foxtrotter? well I got 2 on my list hehe"
26-01-2019T20:06:52,Bgrmystr2,so it's a bit difficult to pick out songs atm
26-01-2019T20:06:55,microbuss,ORLY*
26-01-2019T20:07:02,FoxxTrotter,"The House of Guitars in Rochester, NY still has some cassette tapes."
26-01-2019T20:07:23,FoxxTrotter,"I've seen them at thrift stores, of course."
26-01-2019T20:07:31,microbuss,cool Well the other on is The Real Ghostbusters soundtrack
26-01-2019T20:07:34,MviluUatusun,I will admit that I've actually seen a record player.
26-01-2019T20:07:37,FoxxTrotter,8-tracks as well.
26-01-2019T20:07:58,MviluUatusun,8-TRACKS!  Really?  Whoa!
26-01-2019T20:08:05,ThingsAreMoving,Eric's mom is wearing the 'stuck up' necklace
26-01-2019T20:08:09,microbuss,"hey, Mvilu technology has gotten crazy with record players"
26-01-2019T20:08:28,MviluUatusun,I haven't had one of those since the 1980s.
26-01-2019T20:08:31,microbuss,theres one that uses a LASER !
26-01-2019T20:08:33,FoxxTrotter,Some thrift stores have 45 RPM records as well.
26-01-2019T20:08:40,Apostrophe,I'm sitting in a room with several hundred cassette tapes and three working decks this very moment
26-01-2019T20:09:00,MviluUatusun,That's interesting micro.  I remember reading about experiments on that kind of technology.
26-01-2019T20:09:00,Apostrophe,Lucky to have an abundance of cool record stores where I live.
26-01-2019T20:09:18,CatzArt,you all are making me feel very young
26-01-2019T20:09:30,MviluUatusun,"Ah,  But, Foxx.  Do they have 78s?"
26-01-2019T20:09:31,FoxxTrotter,I can't remember if Plan 9 in Richmond has any 45 RPM records or not. I know they sell plenty of vinyl albums.
26-01-2019T20:09:37,microbuss,heh well I has a 6 cassette changer Course am looking for the  ultimate cassette & 8-track changers
26-01-2019T20:10:15,FoxxTrotter,It's possible that one may be able to find some 78 RPM storybook records in some of those thrift stores.
26-01-2019T20:10:20,MviluUatusun,"Now, 78s are as rare as hen's teeth."
26-01-2019T20:10:27,FoxxTrotter,"I haven't seen any in quite awhile, though."
26-01-2019T20:10:38,FoxxTrotter,"I have NEVER seen a 16 RPM record, though."
26-01-2019T20:10:52,microbuss,I has
26-01-2019T20:11:00,MviluUatusun,"I had one more years ago than I care to admit to.  I also had a record player that played 33 1/3, 45 and 78."
26-01-2019T20:11:09,SkiddArt,;O
26-01-2019T20:11:12,Apostrophe,16 RPM records were usually used for hour-long radio shows
26-01-2019T20:11:25,FoxxTrotter,My grandfather had an old stereo which had a four-speed record player years back.
26-01-2019T20:11:34,microbuss,oh am serious about the laser record player
26-01-2019T20:11:52,MviluUatusun,"Wow!  Now, those I've never even heard of let alone seen."
26-01-2019T20:12:03,Apostrophe,Laser turntables are a thing
26-01-2019T20:12:12,microbuss,"but its like $25,000 or so for 1"
26-01-2019T20:12:16,BadFoMo,There are /4/ record speeds?!
26-01-2019T20:12:18,Apostrophe,But I've heard they're very sensitive to surface dirt
26-01-2019T20:12:18,MviluUatusun,"I don't doubt you micro.  Like I said, they were experimenting with them in the lte 70s."
26-01-2019T20:12:44,MviluUatusun,*late

26-01-2019T20:13:48,BadFoMo,I've only seen/used the last 3 speeds.
26-01-2019T20:13:56,microbuss,also b4 records went flat they were a wax cyclinder
26-01-2019T20:13:59,Bgrmystr2,but the dark color really brings out the detail put into it
26-01-2019T20:14:02,MviluUatusun,"They're called wall things, Bgr. LOL."

26-01-2019T20:51:16,ThingsAreMoving,I love it when I take a huge breath in through my nose and it freezes from the inside.
26-01-2019T20:51:19,MviluUatusun,"Do whut, Catz!?  Are you serious?"
26-01-2019T20:51:26,ThingsAreMoving,And unfreezes when I let the air out

26-01-2019T20:51:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Dude that’s unhealthy. I’m 5”5 and 130 is what I’m supposed to be
26-01-2019T20:51:57,MviluUatusun,"You're 6'2"" and weigh only 120?"
26-01-2019T20:52:24,ShadowSoap,I believe Catz is literally a twig.

26-01-2019T20:54:28,Mippy,Unfortunatly....I'm built like my dad
26-01-2019T20:54:38,ThingsAreMoving,well he can't help it. And if he's feeling fine then he shouldn't force himself to gain weight
26-01-2019T20:54:46,MviluUatusun,I bet if Catz stands sideways and sticks out his tongue he'd look like a zipper.

26-01-2019T20:55:51,MviluUatusun,"No.  Just a quote I heard about me when I was young, Catz.  I used to be VERY skinny."
26-01-2019T20:56:11,ThingsAreMoving,forcing yourself to gain weight is more unhealthy than being a bit underweight
26-01-2019T20:56:32,MviluUatusun,BBS.
26-01-2019T20:56:34,CatzArt,yeah I went through a period of trying to gain weight nothing happend

26-01-2019T21:31:22,CatzArt,thats cool Horse. what the brits call the war of independence a civil war. Thats cool
26-01-2019T21:31:42,CrimsonHelsing,Trace... you are a lucky bastard to get a good woman twice in a row lol
26-01-2019T21:31:58,ProsePro7,"The founding fathers, how to be successful at treason"
26-01-2019T21:32:00,IronHorseComics,"one would argue three times, we all know Nora is biding her time"
26-01-2019T21:32:05,Bgrmystr2,and still somehow keep this luck trying to murder an entire race..
26-01-2019T21:32:08,MviluUatusun,I thought the Brits called it a revolution and we call it a war of independence.
26-01-2019T21:32:33,Bgrmystr2,"well, both are true."
26-01-2019T21:32:38,CatzArt,I went and saw the reenactment of gettysburg which was cool. they had root beer floats and everything
26-01-2019T21:32:47,Ordithus,It's typically called the Revolutionary war
26-01-2019T21:32:47,ShadowSoap,I pretty much use them interchangeably.
26-01-2019T21:32:53,ShadowSoap,Mvily
26-01-2019T21:32:58,Combak,"Hmm... Maybe so. I'm getting something different when I Google ""British Civil War."""
26-01-2019T21:32:59,ShadowSoap,*Mvilu
26-01-2019T21:33:10,MviluUatusun,"Yeah, Soap.  I know what you mean."
26-01-2019T21:33:13,IronHorseComics,yeah I've heard both used over the years
26-01-2019T21:33:23,CatzArt,What I never got from the British is why the Irish war for independence is called the troubles?
26-01-2019T21:33:26,Ordithus,"The British Civil War, as it's normally called, is much earlier."
26-01-2019T21:33:30,MviluUatusun,"Combak, you're probably getting the Wars of the Roses."
26-01-2019T21:33:53,CatzArt,Isnt the war of roses when the battle of Hastings took place?
26-01-2019T21:33:58,Combak,Whatever. Moving on.
26-01-2019T21:34:02,IronHorseComics,"if memory serves me correctly, that was when the Brits started wearing their distinctive red coats"
26-01-2019T21:34:19,IronHorseComics,which I could be wrong so yeah...
26-01-2019T21:34:25,CrRAR,...red coats...
26-01-2019T21:34:28,Apostrophe,"The war of the Roses had something to do with Westeros, right?"
26-01-2019T21:34:28,MviluUatusun,"Are you serious, Catz?  That was 1066 when my ancestor, William the Conqueror, conquered England."
26-01-2019T21:34:38,Ordithus,Saria's lingerie is :ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:

26-01-2019T21:34:54,MviluUatusun,"No complaints from me, or Trace, Ord."

26-01-2019T21:37:37,BadFoMo,Who are you again?
26-01-2019T21:37:38,Combak,"Tom, you're normally quiet."
26-01-2019T21:37:38,MrMongMong,"Catz, thank you. I have returned!"
26-01-2019T21:37:40,MviluUatusun,"No problem, Tom.  We entertained ourselves."
26-01-2019T21:37:41,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Its all good

26-01-2019T21:37:47,Ordithus,"Zombie Tom, watch out!"
26-01-2019T21:37:50,MrMongMong,It's ok.
26-01-2019T21:37:53,CatzArt,What was the question BGR? its fine tom we were fine by our lonesome talking about wars
26-01-2019T21:37:56,CrRAR,"Remember, don’t touch the collars you get zapped!"
26-01-2019T21:38:13,unsteddyphoenix,Do you ever go into zombie mode and then just suddenly realise youre done?
26-01-2019T21:38:16,Bgrmystr2,Droning is something I've done in the past.
26-01-2019T21:38:17,ProsePro7,Ooh wee that underwear

26-01-2019T21:38:22,Twokinds,Most of the time
26-01-2019T21:38:22,Ordithus,The collar doesn't know what to do with Karen is all
26-01-2019T21:38:26,MrMongMong,I thought it only shocks you if it's a Basitin doing the touching.
26-01-2019T21:38:30,unsteddyphoenix,Thats a neat feeling
26-01-2019T21:38:33,Twokinds,It's like driving back home

26-01-2019T21:39:14,ShadowSoap,Then you realize your almost home and went through half of a Queen CD
26-01-2019T21:39:15,unsteddyphoenix,Is that just colouring/inking or can you autopolit sketches too?
26-01-2019T21:39:23,CrRAR,:saxophone::chipmunk:
26-01-2019T21:39:34,Bgrmystr2,autopilot is a great way to get shit done

26-01-2019T21:39:51,Bgrmystr2,you just go into the zone and completely focus on doing what you're doing best.
26-01-2019T21:40:14,ShadowSoap,I see it as  just a way for the brain to save energy
26-01-2019T21:40:14,Bgrmystr2,"every time I'm grinding on a game or watching an anime or something, I do that."
26-01-2019T21:40:15,CatzArt,Deference for Darkness from halo ODST has one of my favorite saxaphone parts in it
26-01-2019T21:40:25,Combak,"Yeah, I wish I could channel that more often..."

26-01-2019T21:41:10,ShadowSoap,Just start a game of Civ at 10pm.

26-01-2019T21:41:50,Bgrmystr2,but getting mad if you're failing usually interrupts the thought process
26-01-2019T21:41:51,CatzArt,Heh With every picture i complete I get better BGR.
26-01-2019T21:42:09,CatzArt,Its like working on a puzzle

26-01-2019T21:42:18,ShadowSoap,I'm taking a Photoshop class in College. Hopefully to use it to tidy up some of my maps eventually
26-01-2019T21:42:32,Bgrmystr2,puzzles are fairly easy though.
26-01-2019T21:42:52,BadFoMo,"A little late for the autopiolet bit, but..."
26-01-2019T21:42:54,CatzArt,try an 1000 piece puzzle and ask me that again BGR

26-01-2019T21:45:16,CatzArt,tom will try to slice you with his pen like fruit ninja
26-01-2019T21:45:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Nah. I spook him and he’ll bite his own tongue again and blame me
26-01-2019T21:45:31,unsteddyphoenix,No.
26-01-2019T21:45:32,CrRAR,Pesky tongues
26-01-2019T21:45:47,MrMongMong,He might just continue drawing... He seems really focused right now.
26-01-2019T21:46:01,CatzArt,poke
26-01-2019T21:46:09,Ordithus,Don't poke the artist

26-01-2019T21:46:37,tony1695,You'll wind up with the stylus rammed up your nose
26-01-2019T21:46:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I believe he stopped eating junk food though
26-01-2019T21:46:39,ShadowSoap,Trace is glowing like a Traffic Light
26-01-2019T21:46:46,CrRAR,Haha
26-01-2019T21:46:52,Ordithus,"Saria will bite, too, if Trace isn't careful.  Mrow <3"
26-01-2019T21:46:53,MrMongMong,Because Saria is like a Goddess in this shot.
26-01-2019T21:46:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Trace likely got that katana tail

26-01-2019T21:47:21,CatzArt,What mong?
26-01-2019T21:47:26,tony1695,"Trace either climbs into bed, or gets dragged in forcefully"
26-01-2019T21:47:28,CatzArt,dont you mean bury
26-01-2019T21:48:02,ShadowSoap,Eyes as red as a burning flame
26-01-2019T21:48:04,CrRAR,Luckily Trace is a fellow cat... and not like... an antelope or summthin’
26-01-2019T21:48:14,CatzArt,I think I'm catching on to the lewdness of these streams. I'm not sure if thats a good thing or not
26-01-2019T21:48:17,Combak,Time to make a Liger or two!
26-01-2019T21:48:19,RimaDraws,she would eat him up
26-01-2019T21:48:26,MrMongMong,In more ways than one...
26-01-2019T21:48:30,MrMongMong,"Bad Mong, bad."
26-01-2019T21:48:30,BadFoMo,"Trace: How did you talk me into this, Saria?! This is so wrong and lewd!"
26-01-2019T21:48:33,CrRAR,...and not in the good way.... xD
26-01-2019T21:48:38,CatzArt,hah I get it mong
26-01-2019T21:48:42,MviluUatusun,"Actually, Combak, with Trace being a tiger, they'd be making tigons."
26-01-2019T21:48:48,unsteddyphoenix,The good way and THEN the bad way
26-01-2019T21:48:58,CrRAR,XD
26-01-2019T21:49:02,RimaDraws,i love the shading on this one
26-01-2019T21:49:03,Combak,"Whatever, almost no one has that one off-hand."
26-01-2019T21:49:11,CatzArt,I'm learning:ptv-excited: I feel dirty:ptv-grossedout:
26-01-2019T21:49:11,MrMongMong,"Hmmm. But if she transformed back after, um, that, would her kids still be Tigons?"
26-01-2019T21:49:14,EpicFail,:eyes::thumbsup:
26-01-2019T21:49:21,CrRAR,A treat... then a snack!
26-01-2019T21:49:36,CatzArt,okay Now CrRAR lost me
26-01-2019T21:49:36,tony1695,Warning: Do not use the Collar of Keidranification if you are pregnant

26-01-2019T21:50:00,MrMongMong,Side Effects Include: Child not being the same species as parent.
26-01-2019T21:50:11,CatzArt,"talk to your doctor if you experience a rash, fainting upon standing and or death"
26-01-2019T21:50:14,BadFoMo,@tony1695 What if they get pregnant while wearing the coller?!
26-01-2019T21:50:20,Combak,"I feel like we have, and Tom dodged the question."
26-01-2019T21:50:23,MrMongMong,Hmmm. Any volunteers?
26-01-2019T21:50:30,ShadowSoap,:ptv-nope:
26-01-2019T21:50:32,CatzArt,No
26-01-2019T21:50:41,Alphawolf333,It'd depend on how the magic work with the biology really
26-01-2019T21:50:42,tony1695,"That is a good question, FoMo"
26-01-2019T21:51:07,tony1695,"Does the collar just affect outward appearance, or does it fully rewrite DNA?"
26-01-2019T21:51:08,CatzArt,and whoever says yes to vollunteer is getting put in the wildlife rehab hospital
26-01-2019T21:51:14,MrMongMong,"We have one example to go by, which is Raine. But only one of her parents were Keidrian."
26-01-2019T21:51:21,ShadowSoap,I love Tom's shading. It's just...wonderful
26-01-2019T21:51:31,Alphawolf333,So honestly its likely that the children would be fully human
26-01-2019T21:51:32,MrMongMong,And both were so magical that they could break the laws of nature.
26-01-2019T21:51:46,Alphawolf333,assuming that the same principle of magic is being used
26-01-2019T21:51:49,Combak,And it didn't involve the Collar.
26-01-2019T21:51:50,CatzArt,Yup I know what you mean soap. I've been trying to copy his shading style
26-01-2019T21:52:35,MrMongMong,"What if the collar is an applied form of Perfect Transformation, like what Euchre uses?"
26-01-2019T21:52:53,Combak,"Well, we don't know if it is yet!"
26-01-2019T21:52:55,CatzArt,well then the masks would have a fit Mr mong

26-01-2019T22:09:51,SpazztasticKiwi,"If he wants under the covers and can’t seem to get my attention, it appears he try’s the pity card and shivers"
26-01-2019T22:10:37,unsteddyphoenix,D:
26-01-2019T22:10:43,unsteddyphoenix,Hes so cold!
26-01-2019T22:10:45,unsteddyphoenix,Let him IN
26-01-2019T22:10:49,MviluUatusun,"Well, I'll see y'all next time.  I've got to get up around 5:00 am (less than 7 hours) to get ready to eat breakfast, check out of my room, and drive back home.  I'll see y'all next time.  Take care."
26-01-2019T22:11:08,SpazztasticKiwi,He gets to burrow under the blankets if he wants
26-01-2019T22:11:10,Bgrmystr2,seeya mvilu
26-01-2019T22:14:32,SpazztasticKiwi,I was told he was trouble while I was in town but he’s been a very good kitty since I got back
26-01-2019T22:14:51,SpazztasticKiwi,So I gib treats
26-01-2019T22:15:19,unsteddyphoenix,Nice
26-01-2019T22:15:30,unsteddyphoenix,Doesnt matter if he's rude to everyone else if he;s good to you
26-01-2019T22:15:32,Bgrmystr2,probably doesn't respect the people taking care of him while you were gone
26-01-2019T22:15:42,Bgrmystr2,"also, that's just encouraging him to be bad to other people"
26-01-2019T22:19:21,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah >:)
26-01-2019T22:19:27,Bgrmystr2,"man, I'm still blown away by that new page. Like.. I know.. I was there when he drew it, but damn"
26-01-2019T22:20:50,Bgrmystr2,"Many dramatic, Very save. Much incredible."
26-01-2019T22:24:52,SpazztasticKiwi,No he don’t listen to anyone else as best as me
26-01-2019T22:25:36,Twokinds,:D
26-01-2019T22:25:52,SpazztasticKiwi,All I gotta say is what are you doing and he stops most often. Others have to get up and shoo him
26-01-2019T22:26:09,unsteddyphoenix,Like Holly!
26-01-2019T22:26:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Much lighting. Many cinematic. Very wow
26-01-2019T22:27:14,unsteddyphoenix,I think its cute
26-01-2019T22:27:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom got the blinding glo
26-01-2019T22:27:30,unsteddyphoenix,Cats only listenin' to their favourites~
26-01-2019T22:27:32,unsteddyphoenix,Wholesome
26-01-2019T22:27:35,SpazztasticKiwi,What highlighter you use
26-01-2019T22:27:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Mabeline?
26-01-2019T22:29:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Trace uses Coversquirel. Gotta be. No other brand has such pristine lighting
26-01-2019T22:30:03,Bgrmystr2,hahaha
26-01-2019T22:33:25,SpazztasticKiwi,"Makeup puns and nobody-else-gets-it puns aside, it’s really a great page"
26-01-2019T22:34:08,Bgrmystr2,"hey, I saw all those dumb and silly commercials in the 90s and stuff.."
26-01-2019T22:34:11,SpazztasticKiwi,I like color and lighting though so there is that
26-01-2019T22:34:12,Bgrmystr2,so I get it.
26-01-2019T22:34:18,Bgrmystr2,I understand those references.
26-01-2019T22:34:28,Bgrmystr2,You're in good company. :ptv-victory:
26-01-2019T22:34:29,unsteddyphoenix,It does what any great page should do; leaves us desperate to find out what happens next
26-01-2019T22:34:41,Ordithus,Death
26-01-2019T22:34:54,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock:
26-01-2019T22:34:58,SpazztasticKiwi,You’re a ray of sunshine aren’t you
26-01-2019T22:34:59,Bgrmystr2,Ord.

26-01-2019T22:35:24,Ordithus,You didn't specify a time frame
26-01-2019T22:35:31,Ordithus,Death is inevitable
26-01-2019T22:35:42,unsteddyphoenix,What if youre a dragon
26-01-2019T22:36:13,Bgrmystr2,"well, he did say ""next"""
26-01-2019T22:36:14,Ordithus,I'm a dragon? :cw0lfmare-EmberTooHappy:
26-01-2019T22:36:17,Bgrmystr2,that is a timeframe.
26-01-2019T22:36:30,Bgrmystr2,literally next thing to happen in time. xD
26-01-2019T22:36:39,unsteddyphoenix,The hell is that gif lol
26-01-2019T22:36:43,Ordithus,Something will probably die very soon
26-01-2019T22:36:49,Bgrmystr2,ask w0lfmare
26-01-2019T22:37:06,Bgrmystr2,her hair isn't rainbow enough for crazyhappy

26-01-2019T22:41:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Not sure if I’d use em now
26-01-2019T22:42:03,SpazztasticKiwi,More on YouTube recently. Catching up on livestreams
26-01-2019T22:45:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Some news is Mark said he’s happy for Tom
26-01-2019T22:45:34,Bgrmystr2,what happened to tom for mark to say that :o
26-01-2019T22:48:37,Bgrmystr2,is he like.. talking about book 4 release or something?
26-01-2019T22:48:41,SpazztasticKiwi,"He said on his trip home, he found out about Tom’s utilization of Alexa for a schedule"
26-01-2019T22:48:49,Bgrmystr2,ooooh
26-01-2019T22:49:03,SpazztasticKiwi,And how it helped. He apparently thought it was cool
26-01-2019T22:49:23,Bgrmystr2,yeah he had a schedule for a while when he was doing the stream on wed for comic page
26-01-2019T22:49:41,Bgrmystr2,"and he got a lot done, but it seemed like he felt he was falling behind"
26-01-2019T22:49:52,SpazztasticKiwi,"And he also revealed that’s what he’s going to do for his schedule. Just not with Alexa but Siri since he said he, I quote “burned all our Alexas”"
26-01-2019T22:50:19,SpazztasticKiwi,But yeah
26-01-2019T22:50:19,unsteddyphoenix,wut
26-01-2019T22:50:19,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
26-01-2019T22:50:38,unsteddyphoenix,Very wacky
26-01-2019T22:50:47,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock::fire::fire::fire::fire:
26-01-2019T22:50:58,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s what he said. There’s video evidence unless he deletes the stream cashe
26-01-2019T22:51:55,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
26-01-2019T22:51:56,SpazztasticKiwi,"But other than that, Seán is doin a charity stream each month this year and selling a commemorative, collectible pin for each stream"
26-01-2019T22:52:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Also Seán = Jacksepticeye
26-01-2019T22:52:21,Bgrmystr2,oh nice
26-01-2019T22:52:23,Bgrmystr2,yeah
26-01-2019T22:52:34,Bgrmystr2,I watched him for a while
26-01-2019T22:52:40,Bgrmystr2,good dude
26-01-2019T22:52:45,SpazztasticKiwi,I like this charity’s pin
26-01-2019T22:52:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Probably gonna get it
26-01-2019T22:53:08,Bgrmystr2,I don't know how the hell he has the energy to keep that shit up
26-01-2019T22:53:10,Bgrmystr2,but damn
26-01-2019T22:53:13,Bgrmystr2,go him
26-01-2019T22:53:31,SpazztasticKiwi,He runs on irishness
26-01-2019T22:54:04,Bgrmystr2,It's not even that. It's like he's like a 5 year old in a candy shop after been given both a suger overload and coffee.
26-01-2019T22:54:12,Bgrmystr2,he just explodes through the fuckin wall
26-01-2019T22:54:17,SpazztasticKiwi,"I get what you mean. Dudes like a squirrel who drank a dozen expressos, a snort of coke, and got electrocuted"
26-01-2019T22:54:24,Ordithus,lol
26-01-2019T22:54:25,Bgrmystr2,absolutely
26-01-2019T22:54:31,Bgrmystr2,he's like Hammie.
26-01-2019T22:54:37,Bgrmystr2,on softdrinks.
26-01-2019T22:54:50,SpazztasticKiwi,But bless the Lord I got to meet the guy
26-01-2019T22:55:04,Bgrmystr2,he's the same in person as he is on youtube huh
26-01-2019T22:55:06,SpazztasticKiwi,One of my favorite humans on earth
26-01-2019T22:55:26,SpazztasticKiwi,He’s rather chill in person. A lil taller than in used to seeing him
26-01-2019T22:55:37,SpazztasticKiwi,But then again I’m used to seeing him on my phone screen
26-01-2019T22:55:48,Bgrmystr2,"yeah he seems chill, the loud thing is what he does for youtube.'"
26-01-2019T22:56:11,Bgrmystr2,I still think my favorite video of his when he tried the impossbile game.
26-01-2019T22:56:41,SpazztasticKiwi,"Like Mark, he has the word vomit problem too"
26-01-2019T22:57:10,Bgrmystr2,that is actually the best way to be a youtuber honestly
26-01-2019T22:57:31,Bgrmystr2,"cuz you have noone to talk to, you have to talk at the people in such a way that's entertaining"
26-01-2019T22:57:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Sometimes with both of em they give you just a hair too much information
26-01-2019T22:58:02,Bgrmystr2,"lool, I never felt that way"
26-01-2019T22:58:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Like when Seán jumped in his chair playing a game and announced he’d just sat on his own...boys
26-01-2019T22:58:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Like. Cool man. I’m sorry..?
26-01-2019T22:58:58,Ordithus,He had to explain why he was in pain
26-01-2019T22:59:48,SpazztasticKiwi,It was funny. Admittedly
26-01-2019T23:00:11,Bgrmystr2,Dx ow
26-01-2019T23:00:22,Bgrmystr2,yeah agree w/ ord
26-01-2019T23:00:56,SpazztasticKiwi,And Mark will sometimes fill you in on the stupid stuff he did that day. Like using a steak knife to cut his breakfast bagel
26-01-2019T23:01:12,SpazztasticKiwi,frozen bagel. He sliced his thumb
26-01-2019T23:01:46,Ordithus,Ow
26-01-2019T23:02:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Dude needs to be wrapped in bubble wrap
26-01-2019T23:02:29,Ordithus,He'd have way too much fun with that
26-01-2019T23:02:48,SpazztasticKiwi,This is unfortunately very true
26-01-2019T23:03:00,Bgrmystr2,haha
26-01-2019T23:03:10,Bgrmystr2,"hey, I would too."
26-01-2019T23:03:14,Bgrmystr2,Who the fuck wouldn't?
26-01-2019T23:03:31,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, if bubble wrap, like the BIG ones aren't enjoyable to you, you're not even human"
26-01-2019T23:03:51,SpazztasticKiwi,I liked his rant on being a responsible adult. His argument was he wouldn’t have been able to build the shelf behind him if he wasn’t one
26-01-2019T23:04:13,SpazztasticKiwi,But then I kinda sat there thinking “yet you also said it took you three hours”
26-01-2019T23:05:58,SpazztasticKiwi,He did show that he’s got a new eye tracker set up
26-01-2019T23:06:16,Ordithus,What does he use the eye tracker for?
26-01-2019T23:07:30,SpazztasticKiwi,He says he’ll be using it for videos
26-01-2019T23:07:59,SpazztasticKiwi,But that was all he said on it. It also revealed how much his eyes flicker around
26-01-2019T23:08:23,SpazztasticKiwi,I figured the thing would have trouble finding his eyes
26-01-2019T23:08:56,unsteddyphoenix,He's gonna pull up a picture of a pretty girl and look at her boobs for a quick laugh
26-01-2019T23:09:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"And in an effort not to sound racist, only because his eyes do move so much"
26-01-2019T23:09:16,unsteddyphoenix,Hes a bit late to the party with this one
26-01-2019T23:09:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t see him doing that kind of vid. He said he had other plans
26-01-2019T23:10:28,SpazztasticKiwi,And he’s got a girlfriend
26-01-2019T23:10:42,unsteddyphoenix,"Well its gonna be ""accidental"""
26-01-2019T23:10:50,unsteddyphoenix,Thats the whole schtick
26-01-2019T23:12:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I still don’t really see him doin it
26-01-2019T23:12:40,Ordithus,"She was only here for two weeks, but I miss my roommates doggo being here :ctwokinds-LauraCry:"
26-01-2019T23:13:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh yeah. In part to Mark being happy for Tom he gave him a shoutout for the productiveness
26-01-2019T23:15:07,SpazztasticKiwi,He called him an inspiration. All the nice things
26-01-2019T23:15:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Ok I’m doe
26-01-2019T23:15:18,SpazztasticKiwi,d o n e
26-01-2019T23:15:53,Ordithus,Aww he stll looks up to his older bro :ptv-hearts:
26-01-2019T23:18:29,SpazztasticKiwi,He’s covered that. It’s nowhere near a secret
26-01-2019T23:19:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Seán and Malcolm are the same way
26-01-2019T23:19:55,Ordithus,Malcolm?  I'm not familiar
26-01-2019T23:20:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Jacksepticeye has an older brother too
26-01-2019T23:20:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Actually two older brothers and two older sisters but Malcolm is the one he’s closest to
26-01-2019T23:21:46,Ordithus,Off topic but here's the big copy of the ominous figure for your theory making pleasure https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dx5fOXcXQAUiibQ.jpg:orig
26-01-2019T23:22:28,unsteddyphoenix,Man its so ominous up close
26-01-2019T23:22:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh you wanna talk about theories Bgr and I were up around 3 am with that
26-01-2019T23:22:38,SpazztasticKiwi,yesterday
26-01-2019T23:22:42,Ordithus,Wow
26-01-2019T23:22:48,Bgrmystr2,haha
26-01-2019T23:22:49,Bgrmystr2,yeah
26-01-2019T23:22:53,Bgrmystr2,fun times
26-01-2019T23:23:09,SpazztasticKiwi,SOMEBODY had gone to bed
26-01-2019T23:23:17,Bgrmystr2,yeah tom
26-01-2019T23:23:20,Ordithus,I think I saw the tail end of that when I got on in the morning
26-01-2019T23:23:37,Bgrmystr2,I tried to take messages on the chat answering machine..
26-01-2019T23:23:42,Bgrmystr2,but noone left any
26-01-2019T23:23:43,Bgrmystr2,:(
26-01-2019T23:23:56,Bgrmystr2,:star: I tried
26-01-2019T23:23:56,SpazztasticKiwi,🍿
26-01-2019T23:24:25,SpazztasticKiwi,You still watch any of Séans stuff
26-01-2019T23:24:51,Ordithus,I don't think I've watched any of his stuff for a long time
26-01-2019T23:24:58,Bgrmystr2,same for me
26-01-2019T23:25:24,Ordithus,Not a ton of time for youtube lately
26-01-2019T23:25:32,SpazztasticKiwi,He’s still as hyper but in a more contained way
26-01-2019T23:25:44,SpazztasticKiwi,And of course the green hair is gone
26-01-2019T23:26:01,Ordithus,It is :ctwokinds-floAAA:
26-01-2019T23:26:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Been that way for a few years now
26-01-2019T23:26:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Same with Mark and Ethan
26-01-2019T23:27:32,Ordithus,I knew about those two... has it really been that long since I watched JSE
26-01-2019T23:27:49,Ordithus,The years all blend together :ctwokinds-keith8D:
26-01-2019T23:28:20,Bgrmystr2,"bah, jack's green hair was the best."
26-01-2019T23:28:28,Bgrmystr2,and his hat was awesome too
26-01-2019T23:28:33,Bgrmystr2,feels bad to have lost that.
26-01-2019T23:28:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Last time his hair was green was near 3 years ago
26-01-2019T23:29:22,SpazztasticKiwi,And he hung up the hat cause for one - it was actually his mother’s
26-01-2019T23:29:39,SpazztasticKiwi,And he also said he didn’t want it to be the only thing people looked for
26-01-2019T23:29:43,Ordithus,Maybe I just don't remember :thinking:
26-01-2019T23:31:03,SpazztasticKiwi,But yeah. Seán’s shifted a bit. Some may find him more tolerable now but he’s basically the same
26-01-2019T23:31:12,Bgrmystr2,I remember him not using the hat and going full green hair
26-01-2019T23:33:03,SpazztasticKiwi,"Seeing him in person was the best - he’s rather regular, just energetic"
26-01-2019T23:33:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Which is pretty much all of them in a nutshell
26-01-2019T23:33:47,Ordithus,"Ah, now I remember.  The last vid I saw from him was when he was playing the original spyro 3"
26-01-2019T23:34:05,SpazztasticKiwi,He did the remake too
26-01-2019T23:34:20,SpazztasticKiwi,“That would’ve been bad if I’d fallen off”
26-01-2019T23:34:24,Ordithus,I see that now
26-01-2019T23:34:29,SpazztasticKiwi,*immediatly falls off*
26-01-2019T23:35:01,RimaDraws,hiii
26-01-2019T23:35:08,Ordithus,Between spyro reignited and ace combat 7... maybe I should buy a ps4
26-01-2019T23:35:13,Ordithus,Hi Rima
26-01-2019T23:35:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Right up there with watching Mark’s horse driving skills in RDR2
26-01-2019T23:35:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Ay
26-01-2019T23:36:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"In which case you think you’ve seen him mad, go look how he is reacting to Micah in that game"
26-01-2019T23:36:58,Ordithus,When they exterminate that town?
26-01-2019T23:37:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh yeah
26-01-2019T23:37:23,Ordithus,I raidly fell behind on that series... like so many
