21-05-2019T11:59:36,unsteddyphoenix,"Get to it, nerds"
21-05-2019T11:59:47,CrimsonQuill,I am not able to do that
21-05-2019T11:59:58,CrimsonQuill,Because I am not good with computer stuff.
21-05-2019T12:00:14,CrimsonQuill,But I'm sure the others will! :D

21-05-2019T14:04:30,BadFoMo,Inb4 The kiss does something to Sythe?
21-05-2019T14:04:41,CrimsonQuill,She said his name!
21-05-2019T14:29:16,SpazztasticKiwi,I found the men‚Äôs version of a push up bra last night and I‚Äôm tempted to make a sketch out of it. But completely just for show since certain things don‚Äôt show physically on the characters with fur
21-05-2019T14:29:33,CrimsonQuill,Wut
21-05-2019T14:29:45,CrimsonQuill,'push up bra'.
21-05-2019T14:29:51,CrimsonQuill,I do not understand this concept.
21-05-2019T14:29:53,SpazztasticKiwi,special underwear for men
21-05-2019T14:29:59,CrimsonQuill,Ok...
21-05-2019T14:30:09,SpazztasticKiwi,just never mind it if you don‚Äôt get it
21-05-2019T14:30:18,CrimsonQuill,ok
21-05-2019T14:30:20,SpazztasticKiwi,You‚Äôd likely be better off not knowing
21-05-2019T14:30:24,CrimsonQuill,Probably
21-05-2019T14:30:36,CrimsonQuill,I'm tempted to stay up tonight.
21-05-2019T14:30:44,CrimsonQuill,Considering my exams are done.
21-05-2019T14:32:04,SpazztasticKiwi,This heat got me tempted to cut my hair off
21-05-2019T14:33:02,CrimsonQuill,Humid?
21-05-2019T14:33:44,SpazztasticKiwi,My hair resembles a seeding mushroom when you step on it and it goes puff
21-05-2019T14:34:01,SpazztasticKiwi,puffy thick curls
21-05-2019T14:34:30,CrimsonQuill,Mine doesn't
21-05-2019T14:34:36,CrimsonQuill,I have my mum's hair.
21-05-2019T14:34:39,CrimsonQuill,Thick but flat.
21-05-2019T14:34:51,CrimsonQuill,I had a nice cut a few weeks ago
21-05-2019T14:35:01,CrimsonQuill,"It's a good, managable length."
21-05-2019T14:37:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Mines managable if it‚Äôs not windy or needs a wash. Otherwise it fluffs out like a blow dried pomeranian
21-05-2019T14:37:28,SpazztasticKiwi,and hairspray is the devil
21-05-2019T14:37:31,CrimsonQuill,My hair is nice most of the time..
21-05-2019T14:37:48,CrimsonQuill,But if it grows a bit too long it looks like I'm a lollipop in silhouette.
21-05-2019T14:37:54,CrimsonQuill,It grows rather evenly.
21-05-2019T14:54:12,Twokinds,MM1 is almost over.
21-05-2019T14:54:22,Twokinds,Hope people have enjoyed it ^^
21-05-2019T14:59:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Poor Sythe
21-05-2019T15:00:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Sometime I imagine he‚Äôd yell ‚Äúcan‚Äôt everyone be normal...FOR FIVE MINUTES!?‚Äù

21-05-2019T19:19:57,SpazztasticKiwi,That thing with Red pulling Marens new tail makes me think of the slap heard round the world
21-05-2019T19:22:09,Bgrmystr2,can confirm
21-05-2019T19:23:38,AspiringNoodle,^
21-05-2019T19:24:11,AspiringNoodle,You guys hear that joke about how hard you'd have to slap a chicken to cook it?
21-05-2019T19:24:21,AspiringNoodle,I think it would apply here :ptv-snicker:
21-05-2019T19:32:59,SpazztasticKiwi,All you hear is this massive smack and half of Red‚Äôs face matches his name
21-05-2019T19:33:08,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúI smell meat cooking‚Äù
21-05-2019T19:33:28,Bgrmystr2,haha or it could just be one of those moments where his face is just kinda scrunched into this black hole lookin thing in the middle of his head
21-05-2019T19:33:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm out till 9. Provided we get done

21-05-2019T22:44:09,Dadrobit,Turns out they missed a spot on the paperwork for their parking exemptions.
21-05-2019T22:45:18,Dadrobit,Missed a spot equals $1k per night in fines.
21-05-2019T22:46:58,Dadrobit,"Though, to be fair, the issuing officer probably should've known better. Everything else was on the up and up for the exemptions."
21-05-2019T22:49:04,Dadrobit,"Got it all cleared up though, no more fines for a week."
21-05-2019T23:01:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I nearly ran over Bagheera gettin my popcorn
