22-01-2019T10:35:35,Dadrobit,I do believe Cox is screwing with my internet.
22-01-2019T10:36:33,Dadrobit,A few weeks ago I got an offer for a new modem. Talked with a rep and told them I was doing alright with my current setup.
22-01-2019T10:39:17,Dadrobit,All of the sudden my internet has gone to shit https://i.imgur.com/ba7Gs9z.png
22-01-2019T10:39:53,Dadrobit,Steadily getting worse since my conversation with their rep :thinking:
22-01-2019T10:57:20,CrimsonQuill,Afternoon
22-01-2019T10:57:34,CrimsonQuill,"Internet gone to tosh, Dadrobit? I've been there."
22-01-2019T11:00:34,Dadrobit,Honestly I didn't mind the offer of a free new modem. It was when the rep started upselling the modem + wi-fi router at a monthly premium that I got antsy.
22-01-2019T11:01:24,Dadrobit,"""No I don't need that, my router is fine...."" ""No sir, you really should try it with our new ~Panoramic~ wi-fi technology."""
22-01-2019T11:01:43,Dadrobit,Aaaaand the sale was lost.
22-01-2019T11:01:47,CrimsonQuill,Telemarketing?
22-01-2019T11:02:11,Dadrobit,"Nah, I contacted them."
22-01-2019T11:02:39,Dadrobit,Was asking about their offer they sent me in the email for a free modem.
22-01-2019T11:03:38,Dadrobit,"The conversation almost immediately turned into the rep trying to sell me a modem, so I told him that my current one is fine."
22-01-2019T11:04:03,CrimsonQuill,Ok
22-01-2019T11:09:04,CrimsonQuill,"Hey, Dadrobit, are you going to try Book club again in February?"
22-01-2019T11:20:41,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I'll get it done eventually."
22-01-2019T11:21:05,CrimsonQuill,"As always with that one, you have my vote."
22-01-2019T11:21:15,CrimsonQuill,I really like it as a suggestion.
22-01-2019T11:22:10,Dadrobit,One day it'll get through.
22-01-2019T11:32:54,Dadrobit,I think the last thing that got through for me was Sythe riding a super-sized Nibble doing the Akira slide some 7 months ago actually?
22-01-2019T11:32:58,CrimsonQuill,"You will-either as a vote, or a Tom pick."
22-01-2019T11:33:01,Dadrobit,Nibbly*
22-01-2019T11:33:09,CrimsonQuill,I liked that Sythe/Nibbly one.
22-01-2019T11:33:51,Dadrobit,This is actually taking longer to get through than me tring to get my Keith/Maddie/Dead Natani suggestion in.
22-01-2019T11:33:58,Dadrobit,trying*
22-01-2019T11:34:07,CrimsonQuill,It'll get there.
22-01-2019T11:34:33,CrimsonQuill,"I'm actually thinking of requesting a sequel to Halo Raine, where she's with Spartan Kessah, sparring with the Master Chief."
22-01-2019T11:34:48,CrimsonQuill,But I have a Star Wars and Subnautica one first
22-01-2019T11:34:57,CrimsonQuill,And maybe a non-crossover thing.
22-01-2019T11:35:25,CrimsonQuill,I've actually done fanart with Kessah from HoSalamanstra as a Spartan IV...
22-01-2019T11:35:34,CrimsonQuill,It's on my Deviantart.
22-01-2019T11:36:35,CrimsonQuill,I've been drawing a lot lately.
22-01-2019T11:38:03,Dadrobit,"Wait, no. I might be high. The last one I got in was Dust and Fidget on Halloween."
22-01-2019T11:38:14,CrimsonQuill,That was funny.
22-01-2019T11:38:16,CrimsonQuill,Heh.
22-01-2019T11:38:21,CrimsonQuill,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
22-01-2019T11:49:36,Dadrobit,"""CrimsonQuill deviantart"" is not pulling anything relevent"
22-01-2019T11:50:22,CrimsonQuill,I have a different username...
22-01-2019T11:50:30,CrimsonQuill,I can't change it on Deviantart...
22-01-2019T11:50:36,CrimsonQuill,Not unless I buy core.
22-01-2019T11:51:00,CrimsonQuill,And I don't want to do that until my art's reached a higher standard.
22-01-2019T11:51:12,CrimsonQuill,"I can link it to you, if you like."
22-01-2019T11:51:59,Dadrobit,sure

22-01-2019T11:54:20,CrimsonQuill,Be right back
22-01-2019T11:54:24,CrimsonQuill,Have a job to do
22-01-2019T11:54:27,Dadrobit,Cute cat btw
22-01-2019T11:54:33,CrimsonQuill,Thanks
22-01-2019T11:55:18,Mippy,Try to be a bit smoother with your colour. You are very streaky. Other than that you have a decent foundation to work with.
22-01-2019T11:55:30,Mippy,"Also, hello"
22-01-2019T12:04:46,CrimsonQuill,Back
22-01-2019T12:04:52,CrimsonQuill,I see Mippy
22-01-2019T12:05:03,CrimsonQuill,Bear in mind I'm using Crayola colouring pencils
22-01-2019T12:05:14,CrimsonQuill,And this was my first colour drawing in years
22-01-2019T12:05:36,CrimsonQuill,And all the others were made when my art skill could be summed up as very poor.
22-01-2019T12:05:44,CrimsonQuill,"But, thanks for the advice."
22-01-2019T12:06:01,CrimsonQuill,"I'm trying to blend in colours together, and layer them over each other,"
22-01-2019T12:07:35,Mippy,Excuses. Crayola is fine if you know hoe to use them.
22-01-2019T12:07:50,CrimsonQuill,I don't really know how to use them.
22-01-2019T12:08:00,CrimsonQuill,"I'm trying to teach myself, see."
22-01-2019T12:08:39,CrimsonQuill,"Halo Kessah is the first time I consider myself to have drawn something at a decent level, and the first picture I really tried to colour in."
22-01-2019T12:11:54,CrimsonQuill,"So, I'm just drawing and colouring-learning as I go."
22-01-2019T12:12:06,CrimsonQuill,That's the best way.
22-01-2019T12:12:11,CrimsonQuill,I hope.
22-01-2019T12:12:50,Mippy,My “Flora” that I decided to colour different so she is not so Flora like.
22-01-2019T12:12:56,Mippy,http://imgur.com/UG2hqGB
22-01-2019T12:13:09,Mippy,Done in Crayola
22-01-2019T12:16:33,Mippy,You should probably just accept advice and apply it instead of making excuses and brushing it off if you want to improve.
22-01-2019T12:21:56,CrimsonQuill,@Mippy I understand that I shouldn't make excuses. I'm not trying to do so.
22-01-2019T12:22:33,CrimsonQuill,I'm just trying to experiment...teach myself how to do stuff...
22-01-2019T12:22:41,CrimsonQuill,I'll get there in time.
22-01-2019T12:23:11,Mippy,It’s fine to experiment. That’s cool.
22-01-2019T12:23:35,Mippy,I hope to see improvement in your next one.
22-01-2019T12:23:39,CrimsonQuill,I'll probably have the 'streaky colour' problem for a while...
22-01-2019T12:23:44,CrimsonQuill,But I'll get there.
22-01-2019T12:23:52,CrimsonQuill,I've set myself a schedule.
22-01-2019T12:23:56,CrimsonQuill,One colour pic a week.

22-01-2019T12:26:47,CrimsonQuill,My ultimate goal is to reach the level of my two artist sisters/Tom/Jon Joesco/DestinyBlue.
22-01-2019T12:26:50,CrimsonQuill,Those people.
22-01-2019T12:27:11,CrimsonQuill,All great at drawing.
22-01-2019T12:27:28,CrimsonQuill,"Once I've got myself into the once a week, I'll try twice a week."
22-01-2019T12:27:31,CrimsonQuill,And so on.
22-01-2019T12:29:01,Mippy,"Yeah, set goals mate. You gotta use it or you’ll lose it or something :ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:"

22-01-2019T12:29:33,Mippy,All drawing is is a lot of practice
22-01-2019T12:29:39,CrimsonQuill,Another goal is to DRASTICALLY cut back video game and net procrastination.
22-01-2019T12:30:06,CrimsonQuill,"But of course, when push comes to shove, I still have to look out for my surveying work."
22-01-2019T12:30:18,CrimsonQuill,A single mistake can be catastrophic in that field.
22-01-2019T12:30:46,Mippy,"Well there you go. :ctwokinds-NataniHAHA: I’ll often have something on in the background as I work...but things I don’t have to “watch” like a audio book, podcast, or music"
22-01-2019T12:31:17,CrimsonQuill,Music is my jam.
22-01-2019T12:31:25,CrimsonQuill,I just haven't taken time for it in too long.
22-01-2019T12:31:36,CrimsonQuill,Once again the PC eats my soul.
22-01-2019T12:31:57,Mippy,Got some Beck going now...wonder what shuffle will choose next
22-01-2019T12:31:59,CrimsonQuill,I must've listened to Asgore's theme from undertale about 5 times yesterday...including two orchestral remixes.
22-01-2019T12:32:19,CrimsonQuill,I really like John Powell's HTTYD soundtrack too.
22-01-2019T12:32:22,CrimsonQuill,And Halo...

22-01-2019T12:54:27,Dadrobit,The paycheck for the difference should already be in the mail. No litigation required.

22-01-2019T15:23:26,Twokinds,"In the main comic itself, I believe the closest she's ever been is when Kat and Natani came out of the water on the docks, but even then they were covered."

22-01-2019T15:25:39,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-reniembarrassed:
22-01-2019T15:31:57,iliar,Although you did not draw naked Keidran and Maddie on the same frame. I still think Maddie should have seen them earlier. Given that Kat and Flora often do not wear clothes.
22-01-2019T15:32:05,iliar,"In addition, Nathan often has problems with clothes."
22-01-2019T15:32:22,Twokinds,I said that.
22-01-2019T15:32:42,Twokinds,All I'm saying is I've never drawn how she reacts to it.
22-01-2019T15:34:07,iliar,I wonder why she was not shy when she saw a naked woman.

22-01-2019T16:54:54,Bgrmystr2,You wouldn't ask a bunch of people with has
22-01-2019T16:55:01,Twokinds,I would.
22-01-2019T16:55:05,Bgrmystr2,xD nooo
22-01-2019T16:55:14,Twokinds,"And if I would use that phrase, than someone like Mike certainly would."
22-01-2019T16:56:12,ThingsAreMoving,"Welp, there's logic in that."
22-01-2019T16:56:56,Bgrmystr2,"Has is when you use he she and it, have is when you use I, you, we, and they"
22-01-2019T16:57:28,Bgrmystr2,"has is a 3rd person, but mike is addressing them directly"
22-01-2019T16:57:42,Bgrmystr2,https://writingexplained.org/has-vs-have-difference:ptv-wondering:
22-01-2019T16:57:50,Bgrmystr2,.. nice picarto
22-01-2019T16:58:04,Twokinds,I am aware

22-01-2019T16:58:44,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
22-01-2019T16:58:45,Twokinds,"But again, I wouldn't think this much about it. And I feel like an uneducated sailor wouldn't either."
22-01-2019T16:59:05,TerraTheWizard,leave the boy and his wording alone
22-01-2019T16:59:15,Twokinds,"But if it bothers you that much, I'll make it have"
22-01-2019T16:59:19,ThingsAreMoving,"-""The cannons be ready, captain!"" -ARE!"
22-01-2019T16:59:21,Twokinds,Even though I don't think it's a big deal.
22-01-2019T16:59:52,Bgrmystr2,"well, I didn't think it was a big deal either, I just didn't know if you did it intentionally because it was mike, or if it was accidental."
22-01-2019T17:00:05,Bgrmystr2,He's never spoken in an uneducated way in the comic before
22-01-2019T17:00:12,Bgrmystr2,"not that I recall, anyway"
22-01-2019T17:00:19,Twokinds,I wrote it that way because that's how I say it
22-01-2019T17:02:11,Bgrmystr2,maybe with this we can repair more than just the text in the sketch :ptv-excited:
22-01-2019T17:06:40,CommanderTrace,Hello :ptv-victory::ptv-greetings:

22-01-2019T17:13:02,ThingsAreMoving,:ctwokinds-kingtea:
22-01-2019T17:25:07,Bgrmystr2,probably because your body is used to it
22-01-2019T17:25:17,Bgrmystr2,it's built up a resistance to both the coffee and the rum
22-01-2019T17:33:15,ThingsAreMoving,I meant tea... dunno why I wrote coffee.
22-01-2019T17:33:29,Bgrmystr2,tea+coffee+rum
22-01-2019T17:33:31,Bgrmystr2,go

22-01-2019T17:33:43,ThingsAreMoving,"still, gonna enjoy it while I'm resistant to it"
22-01-2019T17:34:06,ThingsAreMoving,experiments like that are conducted only on weekends
22-01-2019T17:34:15,ThingsAreMoving,for safety reasons
22-01-2019T17:39:07,Bgrmystr2,fridays and saturdays

22-01-2019T18:07:04,ThingsAreMoving,"Now that I think of it, we don't have many pirate-themed drawings, do we?"
22-01-2019T18:21:03,TerraTheWizard,we have 2 that i can think of
22-01-2019T18:21:20,TerraTheWizard,"well, 2 sunday sketches"
22-01-2019T18:21:51,Bgrmystr2,"aaaaa there's gonna be a new racing game later this year, first time I'm hype in many a year."

22-01-2019T18:26:34,TerraTheWizard,was about to post that

22-01-2019T18:27:07,Bgrmystr2,"the other sketch was done too, when they were on the small boat"
22-01-2019T18:27:20,Bgrmystr2,yeah that's it
22-01-2019T18:27:24,Bgrmystr2,"that's the one, terra got it"
22-01-2019T18:31:36,ThingsAreMoving,"What game, Bgr?"
22-01-2019T18:34:34,Bgrmystr2,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDK8FOIwznc
22-01-2019T18:35:49,Bgrmystr2,Gensou SkyDrift. Will probably play that game till the day it dies.
22-01-2019T18:36:45,ThingsAreMoving,Are those.... little girls riding on little girls?
22-01-2019T18:36:48,unsteddyphoenix,Oh my GOD Maddie's so cute
22-01-2019T18:36:54,ThingsAreMoving,o/ unfteddy
22-01-2019T18:37:16,Bgrmystr2,"Yes, Things. That is how it happens in Touhou. You just nod and agree."
22-01-2019T18:37:23,Bgrmystr2,and then drift around the next corner.
22-01-2019T18:37:51,Bgrmystr2,with the obligatory eurobeat soundtrack being the obvious choice.
22-01-2019T18:38:06,ThingsAreMoving,I guess that's... normal within that premise?
22-01-2019T18:38:25,Bgrmystr2,"To be fair, it's not happened that I recall"
22-01-2019T18:38:30,Bgrmystr2,not to such a way
22-01-2019T18:38:44,Bgrmystr2,but it's would absolutely not be out of the ordinary
22-01-2019T18:39:02,ThingsAreMoving,'tis a weird world we live in
22-01-2019T18:39:50,Bgrmystr2,"perhaps, but yknow, it's a touhou game, it's a racing game, it's got drifting AND eurobeat.."
22-01-2019T18:39:55,Bgrmystr2,what more could I possibly want?
22-01-2019T18:40:13,unsteddyphoenix,Eurobeat you say...
22-01-2019T18:40:26,ThingsAreMoving,I want a racing game with lots of pvp elements
22-01-2019T18:40:30,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, in the game trailer I put up there ^"
22-01-2019T18:40:43,Bgrmystr2,"there are a lot of those, things lol"
22-01-2019T18:41:19,ThingsAreMoving,Honestly It's a game I'd try out if I had a switch.
22-01-2019T18:41:23,Bgrmystr2,Extreme-G / XG2 were probably a classic
22-01-2019T18:41:40,Bgrmystr2,"Oh no worries, it's being released for PS4, Switch, and Steam on PC"
22-01-2019T18:41:58,unsteddyphoenix,...Tom did you draw bones in Maddie's hair?
22-01-2019T18:42:06,ThingsAreMoving,That's Karen
22-01-2019T18:42:11,ThingsAreMoving,"and yes, he did."
22-01-2019T18:42:15,unsteddyphoenix,Oh yeah that one
22-01-2019T18:42:26,Bgrmystr2,what's a what bone where?
22-01-2019T18:42:38,unsteddyphoenix,I think we've solved the mystery of how ahoges work...
22-01-2019T18:42:39,ThingsAreMoving,"Magical Mishaps, new page"
22-01-2019T18:43:00,Bgrmystr2,"well, one of the ways, phoenix"
22-01-2019T18:43:13,Bgrmystr2,"cuz if you cut it off, your head will feel lighter, but you won't feel pain"
22-01-2019T18:43:31,TerraTheWizard,ohi unsteddy
22-01-2019T18:43:42,ThingsAreMoving,There was a drawing when Flora was giving Trace a haircut
22-01-2019T18:43:50,ThingsAreMoving,and she accidentally cut his ahoge off
22-01-2019T18:43:55,Bgrmystr2,yeah that's what I was referencing ^
22-01-2019T18:43:58,ThingsAreMoving,and he said his head feels lighter

22-01-2019T18:57:07,ThingsAreMoving,I wonder if the girls will run off to find a magic-knowing adult and leave Sythe with Nibbs.
