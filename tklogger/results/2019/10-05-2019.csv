10-05-2019T00:12:44,Muddy,"Love that look of Rose in the last panel. Like.. ""your library book is overdue!"""
10-05-2019T00:13:13,krispyk,I'm amazed at how these come together. From nothing to a sketch to this. Art is wild lol
10-05-2019T00:13:33,Sclimshady,Art be crazy
10-05-2019T00:14:07,Muddy,Art be wondrous
10-05-2019T00:15:14,krispyk,I dont know what triggered my memory about this comic but I'm glad it happened. I was like 12 when I first read it. 18 now and it was basically like reading it for the first time again
10-05-2019T00:16:13,krispyk,I never knew he streamed let alone does all the sketches and stuff. The side comics were interesting too for sure
10-05-2019T00:16:17,Muddy,"I discovered Tom's comic 7 years back, when I was recovering from some surgery."
10-05-2019T00:16:43,Muddy,Been a big fan ever since.
10-05-2019T00:16:56,krispyk,Thats great and not great at the same time lul
10-05-2019T00:17:28,krispyk,Hope you recovered well
10-05-2019T00:17:39,Twokinds,Thanks!
10-05-2019T00:17:48,Muddy,Yeah.. not something I ever want to repeat.
10-05-2019T00:18:29,AspiringNoodle,I can't remember when I found TwoKinds.  All I know is that I stopped reading when I let video games consume me.  I'm glad I finally broke away and can get back to reading this :)
10-05-2019T00:18:58,Muddy,The surgery that is. The comic.. I've ordered all the books so far.
10-05-2019T00:19:12,AspiringNoodle,"Also, pursuing art as opposed to playing non-stop video games sounds like a much better use of anyone's time."
10-05-2019T00:19:24,krispyk,I used to be a furry when I was little and I remember the comic helped me deal with those feelings. Now I'm older it's easier for me to comprehend the story. I just love it for the lore and characters now. The art is gr8 too
10-05-2019T00:19:26,LannAF,I think I found Tom's comic through an ad on sage's website
10-05-2019T00:19:40,LannAF,then I met tom in a discord channel with sage
10-05-2019T00:20:02,LannAF,he is pretty relaxed
10-05-2019T00:20:18,krispyk,Noice.
10-05-2019T00:20:25,Muddy,"I paint on the side, and seeing neat little touches.. like this glow behind Raine's head even now, just inspires me."
10-05-2019T00:20:49,LannAF,sage I met playing Minecraft with him and a bunch of others. Read his comics after that (holy yosh is long)
10-05-2019T00:21:00,LannAF,but I enjoyed reading both comics a ton
10-05-2019T00:21:16,krispyk,I used to want to draw when I got little but apparently little me decided quickscoping on rust was a better idea back in the day
10-05-2019T00:21:30,LannAF,back in the day?
10-05-2019T00:21:33,AspiringNoodle,I used to draw.
10-05-2019T00:21:35,LannAF,Rust didn't come out too long ago O_o
10-05-2019T00:21:39,AspiringNoodle,"Then I found WoW, haha"
10-05-2019T00:21:40,LannAF,wait..did it?
10-05-2019T00:21:46,krispyk,Mw2 map lul
10-05-2019T00:21:47,Sclimshady,CHILD!
10-05-2019T00:21:52,LannAF,oh. OH.
10-05-2019T00:22:06,LannAF,yeah that's pretty old lol
10-05-2019T00:22:15,krispyk,Those were my eleme tary school days
10-05-2019T00:22:19,AspiringNoodle,You don't know regret until you let a single game consume 12+ years of your life.
10-05-2019T00:22:21,LannAF,I've had no talents other than playing games and making people laugh
10-05-2019T00:22:43,LannAF,which- I don't mind.
10-05-2019T00:22:51,krispyk,I'm decent at games and kinda ok at rock climbing but that's about it.
10-05-2019T00:22:52,Bgrmystr2,"You say that noodle, but honestly.. I came out a better person because of that very thing."
10-05-2019T00:23:03,Muddy,"I have yet to master digital tablets, so I stick to oil on canvas."
10-05-2019T00:23:21,krispyk,Not really great skills for being in the stage of my life where I become an adult but hey. I'm trying to become a computer engineer tho
10-05-2019T00:23:39,LannAF,I'm also good at resolving conflicts most the time.
10-05-2019T00:23:45,Sclimshady,I need to learn how to art if i ever want to airbrush or pinstripe
10-05-2019T00:23:53,AspiringNoodle,I still feel weird about trying to pursue art at this point.
10-05-2019T00:23:57,LannAF,why not
10-05-2019T00:24:04,LannAF,Just do little doodles on the side
10-05-2019T00:24:08,krispyk,I think it's best I'm not good at art because I definitely have an unholy mind lel
10-05-2019T00:24:25,Sclimshady,:cross:
10-05-2019T00:24:32,AspiringNoodle,I don't plan to do art lightly.  I plan to let it consume me.  That's just my personality.
10-05-2019T00:24:43,LannAF,"my gf does little doodles every so often, and despite it being a decent bit rare, she's somehow gotten pretty great"
10-05-2019T00:24:44,Muddy,My doodles are mostly thumbnail sketches of what I end up painting.
10-05-2019T00:24:47,krispyk,Crazy to see these little details he adds makes such a difference to the page
10-05-2019T00:25:10,LannAF,"Letting things consume you, regardless what it is, isn't healthy"
10-05-2019T00:25:15,Muddy,Tried making a comic of my own. still have most of it. Just need time to restart it again.
10-05-2019T00:25:31,Twokinds,"No, let things consume you."
10-05-2019T00:25:35,LannAF,tom no stop
10-05-2019T00:25:38,krispyk,Twokinds kinda consumed me once I caught back up lol
10-05-2019T00:25:40,SageSaga,no vore
10-05-2019T00:25:44,LannAF,^
10-05-2019T00:25:45,Sclimshady,Let the hate flow through you
10-05-2019T00:25:51,LannAF,we told you this last night
10-05-2019T00:26:00,AspiringNoodle,I'd love it if I could get good enough at art that I could live solely on personal projects.
10-05-2019T00:26:18,krispyk,I was stuck trying to find a way to cope and I stumbled upon a couple of twokinds discords. Good to cope with the withdrawal by talking to other fans lol
10-05-2019T00:26:21,CrRAR,Thingsareconsuming
10-05-2019T00:26:24,BadFoMo,Someone say Vore?

10-05-2019T00:26:46,AspiringNoodle,"Oh, Sage, don't worry :)"
10-05-2019T00:26:57,AspiringNoodle,"While I start practicing art, I plan to read ALL the webcomics <3"
10-05-2019T00:27:00,Sclimshady,"I was gonna say, AI is great"
10-05-2019T00:27:04,LannAF,"Also, I find it funny how often the topic of a twokinds discord comes up"
10-05-2019T00:27:21,krispyk,Trust me it helped me
10-05-2019T00:27:24,LannAF,is it bad I just kind of imagine a cult following waiting for their leader to show up
10-05-2019T00:27:36,krispyk,Being able to talk to others about it made me feel better
10-05-2019T00:27:38,LannAF,As a joke mind you.
10-05-2019T00:27:49,LannAF,I think there's a forum and reddit for his comic too.
10-05-2019T00:28:16,krispyk,Yeah but discord is more IM than those which is better for just getting on and off
10-05-2019T00:28:27,FloofyCat,Raine better use that magic potential to tuck herself in magically.
10-05-2019T00:28:32,krispyk,Forum looks pretty scarcely used
10-05-2019T00:28:34,Muddy,"Interesting.. it appears Raine's slamming the door on Red, magically."
10-05-2019T00:28:41,Twokinds,Rose
10-05-2019T00:28:43,AspiringNoodle,^
10-05-2019T00:28:45,LannAF,dunno. I'm bad at looking at that stuff
10-05-2019T00:28:48,AspiringNoodle,Green magic lady hands
10-05-2019T00:28:55,CrRAR,Yeah other hand
10-05-2019T00:28:56,Sclimshady,"Darn, Tom beat me"
10-05-2019T00:29:00,Muddy,Good point.. it's probably Rose doing the slamming.
10-05-2019T00:29:04,LannAF,smickety smack
10-05-2019T00:29:08,BadFoMo,I thought magic was slaming the door.
10-05-2019T00:29:09,FloofyCat,"Rose can't let the secrets of tuckings ones self into bed out there, its too dangerous."
10-05-2019T00:29:12,RazorToshiba,We can all agree that Raine is cute no matter what
10-05-2019T00:29:12,Twokinds,Raine's magic is blue
10-05-2019T00:29:29,CrRAR,Color-coded
10-05-2019T00:29:33,krispyk,Where does rose stand in magical power compared to the rest of the cast?
10-05-2019T00:29:34,RazorToshiba,what color is Basitin black magic tho?
10-05-2019T00:29:37,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-maddiessparkles:
10-05-2019T00:29:38,Muddy,And Rose's is green?
10-05-2019T00:29:50,FloofyCat,Does everyone have different colours Tom?
10-05-2019T00:29:56,LannAF,what color is your magic tom
10-05-2019T00:29:57,AspiringNoodle,"Rose is probably one of the top spellcasters, but only within the mansion."
10-05-2019T00:29:59,LannAF,is it betrayal
10-05-2019T00:30:00,CrRAR,Trace: blue
10-05-2019T00:30:11,krispyk,Oooh Maddie. Basitins are my fav characters. I adore magpie
10-05-2019T00:30:21,FloofyCat,Well not that they're forced to be different that is
10-05-2019T00:30:25,Twokinds,Most spellcasters are red or blue
10-05-2019T00:30:34,CrRAR,Haha
10-05-2019T00:30:36,Twokinds,Like lightsabers

10-05-2019T00:31:04,CrRAR,lol
10-05-2019T00:31:08,krispyk,That's a sketch to be had lol. Lightsaber weilding characters lul
10-05-2019T00:31:12,Muddy,One wonders if Trace and Flora's kid (or kids) will have magic skills?
10-05-2019T00:31:16,Ordithus,Technicolor magic
10-05-2019T00:31:21,AspiringNoodle,It's likely.
10-05-2019T00:31:34,LannAF,I want to ask about the star wars game now
10-05-2019T00:31:38,LannAF,and ask what y'all are doing
10-05-2019T00:31:51,FloofyCat,"Well if Rose and Raine have it I guess there's some hereditary aspect,"
10-05-2019T00:31:54,SageSaga,almost dying mostly
10-05-2019T00:31:57,krispyk,I just wanna know what this race is that ephemeral has to allow. Will it just be a natural half keidran half human? Hmmm
10-05-2019T00:32:18,Muddy,"I can see it now. Flora: ""Do NOT magically ZAP your brother/sister"""

10-05-2019T00:33:06,LannAF,But does Tom's voice modulator work correctly
10-05-2019T00:33:08,FloofyCat,Flora don't need no magic to zap people.
10-05-2019T00:33:19,Muddy,That's different. Daddy refused to do the laundry.
10-05-2019T00:33:26,krispyk,Rub rub rub rub.... ZAP
10-05-2019T00:33:37,AspiringNoodle,I'm just imagining a keidran discovering that kind of power.
10-05-2019T00:33:46,AspiringNoodle,And then they zap a templar with a sense of humor
10-05-2019T00:33:54,AspiringNoodle,And then the templar reminds them about magic ;D
10-05-2019T00:34:10,ZRO4825,To farm the aggravation that is The Greatest Jagras or not....
10-05-2019T00:34:21,AspiringNoodle,"Gives them a BIGGER zap in return.  Not enough to hurt them, but enough to be funny."

10-05-2019T00:36:11,LannAF,Has anyone here ever played City of Heroes?
10-05-2019T00:36:18,AspiringNoodle,"I imagine that if you magic-slammed a door in a Basitin's face, they'd more or less shrug it off.  Given their high durability and the fact that the magic was not aimed at them."
10-05-2019T00:36:18,SageSaga,uhg
10-05-2019T00:36:21,krispyk,Well I think the stronger the basitin the more resistance to magic they have
10-05-2019T00:36:25,Alphawolf333,A bit
10-05-2019T00:36:35,LannAF,my friend ash is getting me to play it
10-05-2019T00:36:45,AspiringNoodle,"Adelaide's reference sheet confirms this.  As strength goes up, as does magic resistance."
10-05-2019T00:36:50,FloofyCat,I'd imagine the door would just crack into pieces on Adelaide.
10-05-2019T00:36:52,Muddy,LannAF.. no.. never heard / played that game.
10-05-2019T00:36:52,LannAF,I'm surprised ncsoft hasn't screwed their revival
10-05-2019T00:36:57,BadFoMo,Uhg?
10-05-2019T00:37:00,krispyk,I'd figure that they would just get hit by the door. I think it may be more of a resistance to magic itself like illusions etc
10-05-2019T00:37:04,LannAF,I don't think sage likes it lol

10-05-2019T00:55:41,FloofyCat,I wonder if there's a rule that covers Trace being turned into a white tiger Keidran...

10-05-2019T00:55:49,Bgrmystr2,no
10-05-2019T00:55:59,FloofyCat,Then he gets the double whammy and becomes a female white tiger
10-05-2019T00:56:03,Bgrmystr2,R63 only covers male to female and vice versa.
10-05-2019T00:56:15,Bgrmystr2,transformation would be him into a keidran
10-05-2019T00:56:23,FloofyCat,Ye Bgr I meant a separate rule specifically for that
10-05-2019T00:56:23,unsteddyphoenix,"Rule 63.5: F!Trace will always have bigger breasts, no matter what"

10-05-2019T00:58:09,FloofyCat,63.11 as an addendum - even once she steals the art pen hers is still smaller
10-05-2019T00:58:21,krispyk,I saw a sketch where vixen natani got double vixened lol
10-05-2019T00:58:52,FloofyCat,Do you all like sketches going for backstory n' stuff?
10-05-2019T00:58:58,AspiringNoodle,My mind needs to get out of the gutter
10-05-2019T00:59:38,unsteddyphoenix,No I hate all backstory
10-05-2019T00:59:46,krispyk,I feel like the sketches don't have to relate to the story but I love the side comics giving more insight
10-05-2019T00:59:54,unsteddyphoenix,Its just the worst
10-05-2019T01:00:06,krispyk,Masquerade was cool tho..

10-05-2019T01:12:55,BadFoMo,But how can I post Angry Kid stuff then?
10-05-2019T01:13:55,SageSaga,it has to be good- but nothing from that is
10-05-2019T01:13:58,AspiringNoodle,So tired...  I've been trying to go to bed earlier.  Used to be a huge night owl.  These streams gonna revive that streak xD
10-05-2019T01:14:02,SamuelLeumas,Sage still a rem fan?
10-05-2019T01:14:13,SageSaga,of course

10-05-2019T01:15:54,BadFoMo,thinks about being a total troll and asking /who/ Rem is.
10-05-2019T01:16:05,BadFoMo,HAHAHA!
10-05-2019T01:16:13,Sclimshady,:hammer:
10-05-2019T01:16:42,AspiringNoodle,Legit question:  How long before manga / anime's drawing style becomes the dominant artform?
10-05-2019T01:17:01,SageSaga,never
10-05-2019T01:17:40,SageSaga,unless by dominant you mean the most widely done in terms of pure numbers- then it already is
10-05-2019T01:18:20,FloofyCat,To be honest its deceptively difficult.
10-05-2019T01:18:28,AspiringNoodle,"I look at TwoKinds, and I really see the manga/anime influence."
10-05-2019T01:18:44,FloofyCat,Some people find it comes to them easily but usually its incredibly difficult to do anime art styles.
10-05-2019T01:19:12,SageSaga,the shear amount of manga that gets produced in addition to anime itself and those who use the style outside of Japan- outnumbers most other mediums
10-05-2019T01:19:51,FloofyCat,^ There's a ridiculous amount of Manga out there.
10-05-2019T01:20:03,FloofyCat,Its usually all black and white.
10-05-2019T01:20:15,AspiringNoodle,"...this is a Bleach opening, yeah?"
10-05-2019T01:20:33,SageSaga,so was the last one
10-05-2019T01:20:44,SageSaga,this is the very first Bleach Opening
10-05-2019T01:20:53,AspiringNoodle,I've watched so much anime and read so much manga...
10-05-2019T01:20:54,Sclimshady,"Confession, I've never watched Bleach"
10-05-2019T01:21:14,FloofyCat,Me neither.
10-05-2019T01:21:19,SageSaga,you dont need to watch it
10-05-2019T01:21:20,AspiringNoodle,"Combine that with the webcomics I read, I have no doubt I'll just be another drop in the bucket"
10-05-2019T01:21:30,SageSaga,season 1 and 2 were great but then- eeeh
10-05-2019T01:21:43,SamuelLeumas,"There is no set style for anime/manga, I mean you've got the old animes that look extremely different compared to today's ""anime"" style"
10-05-2019T01:21:58,SamuelLeumas,Like astroboy vs... Re:zero
10-05-2019T01:22:10,SageSaga,they still have core similarities
10-05-2019T01:22:14,FloofyCat,But yeah everyone I've talked to says that its hard to do an anime style if you learn that as the first thing because there's no foundation to build off of to make it look good.
10-05-2019T01:22:14,AspiringNoodle,^
10-05-2019T01:22:21,SamuelLeumas,I guess that's true
10-05-2019T01:22:41,SageSaga,there is a foundation to start off of
10-05-2019T01:22:47,SageSaga,it's called Anatomy
10-05-2019T01:22:50,AspiringNoodle,"Anime has evolved over time, but it's arguable that what's happened is that they've slowly fine-tuned it."
10-05-2019T01:23:06,AspiringNoodle,"Also, watch a guy named Legal Eagle on youtube."
10-05-2019T01:23:25,AspiringNoodle,"The moment I watched him, my first thought was ""Oh my God, this guy's head is the base for anime and manga"""
10-05-2019T01:23:32,Sclimshady,Why not an illegal eagle?
10-05-2019T01:23:49,AspiringNoodle,"Like, his head was legit the base outline for an anime character's head."
10-05-2019T01:23:51,SamuelLeumas,Doesn't rhyme as well as legal
10-05-2019T01:24:05,AspiringNoodle,He's a lawyer.  In his spare time he dissects legal scenes in media :)
10-05-2019T01:24:21,FloofyCat,"Yeah, anatomy needs cracking to do most art styles well."
10-05-2019T01:24:27,AspiringNoodle,One of his recent videos was dissecting the Sokovia Accords from the MCU.  And how it would be HELLA illegal in the US.
10-05-2019T01:24:42,Sclimshady,With a scalpel i'd assume
10-05-2019T01:24:49,AspiringNoodle,That thing would violate so many freaking ammendments
10-05-2019T01:25:14,FloofyCat,"I think the MCU is kinda over now, it won't stay as big as it is."
10-05-2019T01:25:21,AspiringNoodle,Almost all art has a basis in anatomy.
10-05-2019T01:25:39,FloofyCat,It'll still be massively popular but nowhere near as it was from Iron Man -> Infinite War
10-05-2019T01:26:02,Sclimshady,I still havent bothered to watch endgame
10-05-2019T01:26:05,SageSaga,i never said Anime is the only art that is based in anatomy did i?
10-05-2019T01:26:06,AspiringNoodle,"People may think cartoon's are ""easy"", but that's because you're drawing the final product that the artist developed.  They had to create a character with exaggerated proportions that's believable"
10-05-2019T01:26:31,SamuelLeumas,"You never did say ""only"""

10-05-2019T01:30:31,AspiringNoodle,"Well, here's hoping that I'm not hopeless when I finally tackle it :)"
10-05-2019T01:32:24,FloofyCat,Tom has had 16 years and was already doing pretty okay from the first comic.
10-05-2019T01:32:37,FloofyCat,Plus the time before where did Halfkinds and anything else he did before that.
10-05-2019T01:32:55,AspiringNoodle,"I'm a bit intimidated, though."
10-05-2019T01:32:59,Sclimshady,I just gave my neighbor 5 bucks worth of beer for 20$ because they were too drunk to get more. Am I a bad person?
10-05-2019T01:33:04,AspiringNoodle,He started at 14.  I'm started much later ^^;
10-05-2019T01:33:17,AspiringNoodle,starting*
10-05-2019T01:33:20,FloofyCat,"Yeah, it certainly is intimidating."
10-05-2019T01:33:57,FloofyCat,"Sclim I've seen people order food delivery from a restaurant under 60 seconds walk away which has a £3.50 total delivery charge, where they have to come downstairs to collect anyway."
10-05-2019T01:34:23,AspiringNoodle,"The big thing is, though.  I can understand how Tom gets things to look the way he does.  But I don't have the same insights he does."
10-05-2019T01:35:04,AspiringNoodle,"So if I try to get the same results.  Either it'll come out close enough, but noticeably ""off"", the amount of time I'd have to devote to single work would be too much."
10-05-2019T01:35:08,FloofyCat,Hopefully one day Tom does some sort of tutorial for all the photoshop techniques or has some sort of reading list for what to look up.
10-05-2019T01:36:06,FloofyCat,Just don't expect to to improve very fast at all is all I can say.
10-05-2019T01:37:04,FloofyCat,Which sucks because its very demotivating but the only way to get good is to just spend loads of time.
10-05-2019T01:37:08,AspiringNoodle,I'm a bit of an indecisive / unconfident person.  So I'm struggling with that.  But I think art is something i really want to do.
10-05-2019T01:37:15,FloofyCat,Sage how long have you been going for?
10-05-2019T01:37:32,SageSaga,almost 6 hours
10-05-2019T01:37:37,AspiringNoodle,Sage started maybe 20 minutes before Tom
10-05-2019T01:37:54,AspiringNoodle,Technical difficulties not withstanding xD
10-05-2019T01:37:55,FloofyCat,I mean how long have you been doing art for :p
10-05-2019T01:37:58,Sclimshady,Because Sage can actually be on time
10-05-2019T01:38:11,AspiringNoodle,"Sclimshady throwing shade, *rowr*"
10-05-2019T01:38:23,SageSaga,as long as i can remember
10-05-2019T01:38:34,SageSaga,comics have been going online for over 15 years now
10-05-2019T01:40:05,AspiringNoodle,"Man, I can still remember when I was a kid, I loved drawing cartoon characters."
10-05-2019T01:40:29,AspiringNoodle,Got to the point that I could free-hand them fairly decently.  Then vidya games happened.
10-05-2019T01:40:46,AspiringNoodle,"I'm pretty sure everyone's familiar with the ""WoW is crack"" joke."
10-05-2019T01:41:52,Sclimshady,I used to draw nose art until I got suspended for drawing girls riding bombs in class.  Had to talk to the cops and everything
10-05-2019T01:42:05,AspiringNoodle,Freaking zero tolerance -_-
10-05-2019T01:42:20,Sclimshady,Thats California for you
10-05-2019T01:42:34,AspiringNoodle,Here's my thoughts on zero tolerance today:
10-05-2019T01:42:41,AspiringNoodle,"""You see this pencil?  DON'T MAKE ME USE IT."""
10-05-2019T01:42:56,AspiringNoodle,"""I WILL DO MY BEST IMPERSONATION OF JOHN WICK, SO HELP ME GOD."""
10-05-2019T01:43:03,Sclimshady,Not to mention I also got suspended for getting beat up
10-05-2019T01:43:13,AspiringNoodle,THAT is my real beef with zero tolerance
10-05-2019T01:43:22,AspiringNoodle,Just an excuse for the administrators to be as lazy as humanly possible
10-05-2019T01:43:36,Sclimshady,YoU WerE FiGHtiNg
10-05-2019T01:43:56,AspiringNoodle,"""Oh, I'm sorry, what part of me getting my @$$ handed to me on a silver platter was me FIGHTING?!?"""
10-05-2019T01:44:28,AspiringNoodle,"Best advice I've seen:  Lawyer up, and/or threaten a media circus."
10-05-2019T01:44:42,AspiringNoodle,The school will change its tune reeeaaal quick.
10-05-2019T01:45:05,Sclimshady,Not against a gang member I wasnt gonna
10-05-2019T01:45:16,Sclimshady,I choose life
10-05-2019T01:45:33,SamuelLeumas,What is this song? It sound familiar?
10-05-2019T01:45:58,AspiringNoodle,"Sclim, here's something ironic."
10-05-2019T01:46:24,Sclimshady,Yes?
10-05-2019T01:46:30,AspiringNoodle,"So, I lost over a decade of time I could've spent drawing thanks to WoW.  I went to college to get a degree so I could get into game development."
10-05-2019T01:46:49,AspiringNoodle,Wouldn't you know it?  My particular major forced me to take art classes.
10-05-2019T01:47:04,SamuelLeumas,"Oh, got it"
10-05-2019T01:47:15,SamuelLeumas,It's a cover of that smash ultimate song
10-05-2019T01:47:41,Sclimshady,"Ha, I was so bad at art i got a C even though I never missed an assignment"
10-05-2019T01:47:56,AspiringNoodle,"Before I know it, I am pursuing an art minor as I'm somewhat struggling with the coding courses (mainly due to disinterest / game addiction)"
10-05-2019T01:48:17,AspiringNoodle,My GPA for programming was something like 2.7.  Overall was 2.984
10-05-2019T01:48:25,AspiringNoodle,Art minor?  Over 3.5
10-05-2019T01:48:33,Sclimshady,Nice
10-05-2019T01:49:15,AspiringNoodle,There's SOMETHING there.  I'm just intimidated since I'm over a quarter-century old and I just now wish to pursue it seriously.
10-05-2019T01:49:39,AspiringNoodle,"Then again, something about our society causes us to focus on the examples of early success ^^;"
10-05-2019T01:49:39,Sclimshady,Its not too late unless you make it so
10-05-2019T01:50:11,AspiringNoodle,At least I know where I want to head.  It's SOMETHING art related.  Definitely entertainment.
10-05-2019T01:50:44,Sclimshady,"My Mom has three degrees because she didnt end up liking the first ones, if youre determined theres always time"
10-05-2019T01:51:30,AspiringNoodle,"I'm interested in doing a webcomic, tbh.  You can only read so many comics, mangas, and watch so much animated programming :p"
10-05-2019T01:52:20,FloofyCat,"^ Me too, but I can't draw well and I have limited time :p"
10-05-2019T01:52:59,AspiringNoodle,I think the bigger hurdles are mental than anything else.  A big one being worried about plagiarism.
10-05-2019T01:53:02,FloofyCat,Well I have more than usual for the rest of the months but yeah.
10-05-2019T01:53:08,Sclimshady,"Most of my art is auto related,  ive got some pinstripes planned for my truck once im better"
10-05-2019T01:53:08,FloofyCat,Same really
10-05-2019T01:53:18,FloofyCat,The thing is I always wanted to tell a story similar to Twokinds
10-05-2019T01:53:21,FloofyCat,But then I found Twokinds.
10-05-2019T01:53:41,AspiringNoodle,Same here.
10-05-2019T01:53:43,FloofyCat,"""Oh okay someone has already done it, but ten times better."""
10-05-2019T01:54:21,AspiringNoodle,TwoKinds covers so much material you could cover.
10-05-2019T01:54:39,AspiringNoodle,Taboo interspecies relationships.  Slavery. Racial discrimination.
10-05-2019T01:55:00,Sclimshady,You mean the south?
10-05-2019T01:55:06,FloofyCat,"Yeah, pretty sure you could do somethi-Pffffftttt"
10-05-2019T01:55:11,AspiringNoodle,^
10-05-2019T01:55:15,SamuelLeumas,Damn it sclim
10-05-2019T01:55:19,AspiringNoodle,He be the shade master
10-05-2019T01:55:27,unsteddyphoenix,lol
10-05-2019T01:55:28,AspiringNoodle,Or she?  I don't know
10-05-2019T01:55:30,AspiringNoodle,This is the internet
10-05-2019T01:55:38,AspiringNoodle,It's silly to assume
10-05-2019T01:55:52,FloofyCat,That was brilliant Sclim
10-05-2019T01:55:59,Sclimshady,"Im a nebulous entity, jk im a dude"
10-05-2019T01:56:03,unsteddyphoenix,"Easy ball, but still a homerun"
10-05-2019T01:56:12,unsteddyphoenix,No girls on internet
10-05-2019T01:56:16,SamuelLeumas,"""You mean the south?"", that made me laugh harder than it should have"
10-05-2019T01:56:33,Sclimshady,Only lonely guys pretending to be girls
10-05-2019T01:56:33,FloofyCat,But yeah pretty sure Tom would only encourage people to do something even if its very similar.
10-05-2019T01:56:48,AspiringNoodle,It's odd that I'm somewhat meh at programming.  Because I'm VERY analytical
10-05-2019T01:57:00,Sclimshady,Just dont make that which shall not be named
10-05-2019T01:57:16,FloofyCat,^ Yup...
10-05-2019T01:57:24,SageSaga,all done folks- take care have a good night! I'll color the comic in 12 hours from now as usually on stream
10-05-2019T01:57:33,AspiringNoodle,Awwww
10-05-2019T01:57:33,FloofyCat,G'night Sage :p
10-05-2019T01:57:37,AspiringNoodle,Party's over :9
10-05-2019T01:57:39,Bgrmystr2,thanks for streamin sage :D
10-05-2019T01:57:40,Sclimshady,"Night Sage, great stream"
10-05-2019T01:57:48,AspiringNoodle,And I don't know that which shall not be named is
10-05-2019T01:57:51,AspiringNoodle,:3
10-05-2019T01:57:54,ZRO4825,Have a g'inght Sage ^^/
10-05-2019T01:57:58,ZRO4825,g'night*
10-05-2019T01:57:58,FloofyCat,You don't wanna know
10-05-2019T01:57:58,unsteddyphoenix,Hey sage well streamed
10-05-2019T01:58:00,Sclimshady,Dont worry about it
10-05-2019T01:58:02,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Thanks for the streamy Sage.
10-05-2019T01:58:06,SageSaga,take care Sclim- sorry for threatening to ban you :D
10-05-2019T01:58:07,SamuelLeumas,"I don't know the name either, but I know what they mean"
10-05-2019T01:58:14,Sclimshady,Its good
10-05-2019T01:58:19,AspiringNoodle,"But... if I don't know what it is, how do I know what NOT to do?"
10-05-2019T01:58:35,Sclimshady,You just dont be human garbage
10-05-2019T01:58:56,unsteddyphoenix,Hey wait I second
10-05-2019T01:59:02,unsteddyphoenix,Didnt you say you were good?
10-05-2019T01:59:23,FloofyCat,"Oh trust me Noodle you just have to not literally copy TK in every way but change names a tiny bit, not harass Tom to a point where its quite serious and be able to draw a stick figure in MS paint"
10-05-2019T01:59:56,SageSaga,<_<
10-05-2019T02:00:15,SamuelLeumas,"Thanks for streaming, sage"
10-05-2019T02:00:53,SageSaga,('o')/
10-05-2019T02:00:56,FloofyCat,o/
10-05-2019T02:00:56,SamuelLeumas,"Hm, is sage with comcast?"
10-05-2019T02:01:11,SageSaga,COX
10-05-2019T02:01:11,FloofyCat,Even your goodbye face is more detailed than my wavey face
10-05-2019T02:01:11,sunblaze,hiya
10-05-2019T02:01:16,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Sun
10-05-2019T02:01:23,SamuelLeumas,Not familiar with that company
10-05-2019T02:01:28,ZRO4825,"Hiyas Sunblaze. A wee bit late tonight, lol."
10-05-2019T02:01:34,SamuelLeumas,Just made me think because of the connection issues earlier
10-05-2019T02:01:34,sunblaze,i figured :D
10-05-2019T02:01:43,SageSaga,is comcast for people who dont have comcast
10-05-2019T02:01:43,Sclimshady,Its a midwest thing mostly
10-05-2019T02:01:46,SageSaga,also - Sunblaze!
10-05-2019T02:01:53,SamuelLeumas,Oh
10-05-2019T02:01:57,SageSaga,Did you figure out what you wanted?
10-05-2019T02:02:03,Sclimshady,I think at least
10-05-2019T02:02:09,SamuelLeumas,So just as bad I'm assuming
10-05-2019T02:02:15,AspiringNoodle,"I'm sure I'll come up with something, Floofy."
10-05-2019T02:02:30,Sclimshady,Night all
10-05-2019T02:02:35,FloofyCat,Nighty Sclim
10-05-2019T02:02:41,AspiringNoodle,Night
10-05-2019T02:02:52,sunblaze,I did yes
10-05-2019T02:02:57,SageSaga,tell meeee
10-05-2019T02:03:30,sunblaze,I'd like Lia relaxing at a beach right before the current plotline.
10-05-2019T02:03:37,sunblaze,"""dark storm brewing"""
10-05-2019T02:03:44,FloofyCat,I'd like a burger.
10-05-2019T02:04:16,sunblaze,feels phils pressure for art
10-05-2019T02:04:20,SageSaga,got it!
10-05-2019T02:05:02,sunblaze,ok
10-05-2019T02:05:09,sunblaze,then take care and nap well
10-05-2019T02:05:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nighty night ya'll <3
10-05-2019T02:05:49,AspiringNoodle,Maybe I should go to bed now
10-05-2019T02:06:01,AspiringNoodle,I was up until 5 in the morning yesterday watching Chu's stream xD
10-05-2019T02:06:28,sunblaze,âll the snaketails :P
10-05-2019T02:07:49,AspiringNoodle,"Before the vidya game addiction (now a real thing, but I am exaggerating), I read basically all the comics linked to TwoKinds"
10-05-2019T02:08:07,AspiringNoodle,"Slightly Damned, Las Lindas, Housepets, Caribbean Blue"
10-05-2019T02:08:35,sunblaze,so do I
10-05-2019T02:08:41,sunblaze,and play a lot
10-05-2019T02:08:45,sunblaze,why stop reading them?
10-05-2019T02:08:59,AspiringNoodle,Let's just say I let them take over my life xD
10-05-2019T02:09:10,sunblaze,sure sometimes you have to reorganize since some died and new ones opened
10-05-2019T02:09:23,sunblaze,and not vidio gmaes do that?
10-05-2019T02:09:30,sunblaze,does not sound like an improvement
10-05-2019T02:09:31,AspiringNoodle,"I still had enough control to get schoolwork done and such.  But the majority of my freetime?  If anything opened up, more time for games."
10-05-2019T02:10:20,AspiringNoodle,"As I was nearing the completion of my degree, I was juggling raiding in WoW 3 nights a week, clan wars in World of Tanks 4 nights a week, and throw in a dash of Heroes of the Storm and Overwatch for good measure."
10-05-2019T02:11:06,sunblaze,man I am glad I dislike multipleyer especially those in organized play. to many morons
10-05-2019T02:11:24,sunblaze,but sure THAT can get addictice I haveno doubt
10-05-2019T02:12:04,AspiringNoodle,"There were times I played World of Tanks more than WoW.  but when I quit WoT, that time went back into WoW, even though the purpose was to free up time."
10-05-2019T02:12:35,sunblaze,I came away from my addiction in 2002 during a 3 week holiday in france
10-05-2019T02:12:48,AspiringNoodle,"Well, not entirely.  When I quit WoT, I more or less ""snapped"""
10-05-2019T02:13:12,sunblaze,shaking every evening I realize I am addicted and my love for france (especially french food) is jsut waaaaay bigger then anything a game can offer. so I stopped caring and hey it worked
10-05-2019T02:13:26,AspiringNoodle,At that point I had re-examined my life direction.  That's what led to me pursuing the art minor.
10-05-2019T02:13:46,AspiringNoodle,"Plus, when you hear horror stories about game development literally every other day..."
10-05-2019T02:14:09,sunblaze,I am sure EA means well    :ptv-confused:
10-05-2019T02:14:23,AspiringNoodle,Anyways.  I'm finally breaking through my procrastination.
10-05-2019T02:14:33,AspiringNoodle,"Or trying to, anyways.  We'll see how much my ambition holds up."
10-05-2019T02:14:49,sunblaze,cool do not falter! remember its worth it afterwards
10-05-2019T02:15:06,AspiringNoodle,I got some good advice from Chu's stream.  They were very helpful <3
10-05-2019T02:15:22,AspiringNoodle,Start drawing.  Keep drawing.  Do it on a schedule.
10-05-2019T02:15:40,sunblaze,indeed fixed rituals help that a lot
10-05-2019T02:15:59,AspiringNoodle,"I know that once I start, I will probably have a hard time stopping.  It's what I do."
10-05-2019T02:16:44,sunblaze,"include start drawing keep drawing, do a food break, keep drawing do it on a shedule"
10-05-2019T02:17:28,sunblaze,thats important to do as well (and maaaaany artists neglect that)
10-05-2019T02:17:46,AspiringNoodle,At least I won't have to worry about sitting down for long periods of time xD
10-05-2019T02:17:52,DarthRexKing,bye!
10-05-2019T02:17:58,AspiringNoodle,I seem to be capable of that veeeeeeery easily.
10-05-2019T02:18:05,AspiringNoodle,"Also focusing on a single task, too."
10-05-2019T02:18:44,Bgrmystr2,"based on what I've seen said by many artists, study anatomy, study quality, but focus your actual drawings on speed"
10-05-2019T02:18:54,AspiringNoodle,^^
10-05-2019T02:18:58,Bgrmystr2,"the faster you draw, the faster you can push more art out, and the faster you improve."
10-05-2019T02:19:14,sunblaze,good point
10-05-2019T02:19:15,Bgrmystr2,quality comes naturally over time. The only way to get better with time is speed.
10-05-2019T02:19:18,AspiringNoodle,I plan to do what Tom did (much to the chagrin of everyone around him) when he was younger
10-05-2019T02:19:41,AspiringNoodle,I dug through his journals and found out he was a naughty boy
10-05-2019T02:19:52,sunblaze,yes that florataur :D
10-05-2019T02:19:58,AspiringNoodle,Not that xD
10-05-2019T02:19:58,sunblaze,:ptv-snicker:
10-05-2019T02:20:12,sunblaze,ha you knew what I was talking about
10-05-2019T02:20:25,AspiringNoodle,The fact that he was spending so much time on his comic that he sacrificed school work and got grounded from making comics for a month
10-05-2019T02:21:59,sunblaze,just remember not so sacrifice life and socializing that much and you will be fine
10-05-2019T02:22:12,AspiringNoodle,Does getting a job count? xD
10-05-2019T02:23:27,sunblaze,very much yes
10-05-2019T02:23:34,AspiringNoodle,Yay!
10-05-2019T02:23:59,AspiringNoodle,"Anyways,  I'll probably end up having to put a cap on how much time I spend on a given page.  Should I go through with making a comic."
10-05-2019T02:23:59,sunblaze,it is surprising how much a job can fix in your daily time
10-05-2019T02:24:11,DarthRexKing,Huh. Tom sounded like every other child or teenager at a young age. Not too bright in planning and prioritizing.
10-05-2019T02:24:35,sunblaze,imagine no restrictions... -> you sleep til noon and the day gets borked
10-05-2019T02:24:47,DarthRexKing,Then you waste productivity.
10-05-2019T02:24:56,sunblaze,jobs fix that even if you dislike the actual thing you do
10-05-2019T02:25:27,AspiringNoodle,"I'm getting a retail job.  I procrastinated for far too long.  And the ""job"" I have now barely qualifies as such."
10-05-2019T02:25:36,sunblaze,well yes but it boost creativity on the other hand
10-05-2019T02:25:42,sunblaze,just not productivity :D
10-05-2019T02:25:47,DarthRexKing,"Hmm. Makes me wonder if Tom does have another job besides his comic, maybe his parents should have done a better job at taking it away from him."
10-05-2019T02:26:00,DarthRexKing,"Anyway, I have to go. Later all!"
10-05-2019T02:26:12,AspiringNoodle,"I'm not sure if Tom did have a job when he was younger, but he makes a good amount of money just through patreon these days."
10-05-2019T02:26:27,DarthRexKing,I was talking about now. read again. Goodnight.
10-05-2019T02:26:30,AspiringNoodle,Like... a highly successful amount.
10-05-2019T02:26:36,sunblaze,bye darth
10-05-2019T02:26:40,AspiringNoodle,Later
10-05-2019T02:27:09,sunblaze,perhaps but to reach this point was not easy.
10-05-2019T02:27:29,sunblaze,there is a reason soooo many webcomics give up and I totally understand that
10-05-2019T02:27:55,AspiringNoodle,Chu's stream did mention that luck plays an unfortunate part in success :(
10-05-2019T02:28:16,sunblaze,more like lucky timing
10-05-2019T02:28:18,sunblaze,but yes
10-05-2019T02:31:15,sunblaze,anyway gone as well.
10-05-2019T02:31:20,sunblaze,I wish you success!
10-05-2019T02:31:40,AspiringNoodle,Many thanks.  I just need to get through a bajillion browser tabs.

10-05-2019T05:10:58,unsteddyphoenix,Is she implying that it's painful for her?
10-05-2019T05:11:50,unsteddyphoenix,"Her saying ""same as euchres"" makes me think it's not that same for her..."
10-05-2019T05:12:21,Bgrmystr2,she did say she can't do it naturally and needs to use magic to do so
10-05-2019T05:12:53,Bgrmystr2,but it is possible that there is some pain
10-05-2019T05:13:31,Bgrmystr2,"recall that when trace uses the imperfect transformation, it was extremely painful for any recipient"
10-05-2019T05:14:33,Bgrmystr2,"perhaps that because it runs in the family but for rose it isn't exactly the same as Euchre's, maybe it is a bit painful, but not as bad as when trace uses it on someone"

10-05-2019T14:00:41,CrimsonQuill,Hi Sclim
10-05-2019T14:00:49,Sclimshady,Hi Quill
10-05-2019T14:01:10,CrimsonQuill,Just read the new page
10-05-2019T14:01:36,Sclimshady,Same
10-05-2019T14:01:48,CrimsonQuill,"Great, isn't it?"

10-05-2019T14:03:53,Sclimshady,Just watch the next panel be one of the other groups so we dont find out for months
10-05-2019T14:04:26,CrimsonQuill,Ummm...I didn't comprehend a word of that. Sorry.
10-05-2019T14:04:53,CrimsonQuill,"Also, I prefer to avoid watching the page in progress, as I like the finished product to be a surprise."
10-05-2019T14:05:28,Sclimshady,The next one will probably go back to Maddie and Karen or something to increase suspense
10-05-2019T14:05:38,CrimsonQuill,Maybe
10-05-2019T14:05:50,BadFoMo,Most likely.
10-05-2019T14:07:02,CrimsonQuill,I can't take suspense...
10-05-2019T14:12:00,BadFoMo,"Also, the thing Raine needs to do, I know that sketches get snubbed for spoilers, but /please/ let it be that Raine needs to steal someone elses Human-ness cursing them to be a halfing like her and Red volontarally steps up to sholder Raine's burden!"
10-05-2019T14:12:37,Sclimshady,That would be too sweet. I couldn't take it
10-05-2019T14:12:52,BadFoMo,...It's me fetish.

10-05-2019T14:13:16,Sclimshady,No kink shaming here
10-05-2019T14:15:43,Xexanoth,Meanwhile Maren is just angry because Sythe didn't peek in on her changing :P
10-05-2019T14:16:23,SageSaga,. . . why would she want that?
10-05-2019T14:16:45,CrimsonQuill,I fear for these characters...all of them.
10-05-2019T14:16:55,BadFoMo,Sythe: I'm a gentlmen; not ...whatever Red is!
10-05-2019T14:16:57,CrimsonQuill,It's a testament to Tom's writing...
10-05-2019T14:17:09,CrimsonQuill,That they are written in such a way that they are alive.
10-05-2019T14:17:20,CrimsonQuill,Alive and moving in their own universe..
10-05-2019T14:17:42,CrimsonQuill,But if Raine has to go Feral to gain control...what if it goes wrong?
10-05-2019T14:17:44,CrimsonQuill,:(
10-05-2019T14:17:58,CrimsonQuill,If she suffers any more than she has to..
10-05-2019T14:18:05,CrimsonQuill,I might cry....
10-05-2019T14:18:07,SageSaga,you accept it and move on
10-05-2019T14:18:09,CrimsonQuill,And what about Trace?
10-05-2019T14:18:18,CrimsonQuill,Smoke Hallucination's still there.
10-05-2019T14:18:22,CrimsonQuill,Trying to take control.
10-05-2019T14:18:30,CrimsonQuill,What if he manages to claw his way out?
10-05-2019T14:18:37,SageSaga,you accept it and move on
10-05-2019T14:18:39,CrimsonQuill,"But then again, you're right Sage."
10-05-2019T14:18:49,CrimsonQuill,I will have to accept it and move on.
10-05-2019T14:19:08,CrimsonQuill,Or I might end up like Shen in Kung Fu Panda 2 or the Director in Red vs Blue...
10-05-2019T14:19:28,CrimsonQuill,"""I think I have a way...a way to bring her back right this time..."""
10-05-2019T14:19:38,CrimsonQuill,sniffles at the memory.
10-05-2019T14:19:56,CrimsonQuill,But if whatever happens works...Raine will be stronger and more in control.
10-05-2019T14:20:10,CrimsonQuill,And Trace has already held off Smoke Hallucination for a while...
10-05-2019T14:20:38,CrimsonQuill,"I am actually thinking that Smoke Hallucination might at some point seperate from Trace, and operate as his own entity..."
10-05-2019T14:20:52,CrimsonQuill,Heheh...it's actually quite ironic.
10-05-2019T14:21:10,CrimsonQuill,The smoke hallucination is Trace's evil side given a life of it's own...
10-05-2019T14:21:17,CrimsonQuill,And once you give something life...
10-05-2019T14:21:20,CrimsonQuill,YOU CAN KILL IT.
10-05-2019T14:21:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Anyone ever advise you to get a grip
10-05-2019T14:21:57,SpazztasticKiwi,You seem to be spiraling

10-05-2019T14:22:39,SpazztasticKiwi,You seem to be in a small panic. All I’m saying is take a breath
10-05-2019T14:22:52,SageSaga,rambled about a bunch of fictional characters like your fate is tied to theirs like a crazy person
10-05-2019T14:23:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Contain the word vomit
10-05-2019T14:23:19,Sclimshady,"What do you mean ""like"" a crazy person"
10-05-2019T14:23:23,CrimsonQuill,I become VERY involved with fictional characters I care about.
10-05-2019T14:23:39,SageSaga,that's not healthy
10-05-2019T14:23:41,CrimsonQuill,Twokinds...Halo...Salamanstra...
10-05-2019T14:23:47,CrimsonQuill,I try to balance it out anyhow.
10-05-2019T14:23:57,CrimsonQuill,I just love...immersing myself in the story.
10-05-2019T14:24:10,CrimsonQuill,Setting aside a time to become a part of it...

10-05-2019T14:25:23,CrimsonQuill,It's like when my sister showed me Yuri on Ice.
10-05-2019T14:25:24,Sclimshady,I dont like being attached to a character and having them ripped away but its a mark of realistic storytelling
10-05-2019T14:25:54,Sclimshady,"which is why I hate american comics, no one is really in danger"
10-05-2019T14:25:59,SpazztasticKiwi,"So Sage, in an attempt for normalcy, how are you today?"
10-05-2019T14:26:25,SageSaga,im alright- i woke up - got a shower- started streaming
10-05-2019T14:26:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Sounds like a good calm morning
10-05-2019T14:26:45,CrimsonQuill,Did you have a cuppa?

10-05-2019T14:30:35,CrimsonQuill,I do have a serious worrying problem for...just about everything.
10-05-2019T14:31:01,Sclimshady,Thats called anxiety.  you can get help for it

10-05-2019T14:38:53,SageSaga,yeah it wasnt long but it dropped hard- i managed to do a trace route on it while it was happening
10-05-2019T14:39:24,SageSaga,looks like a timeout from my ISP to Picarto - it wasnt from my network to the ISP
10-05-2019T14:40:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Alrighty I’m out till lunch. Have a good time Sage

10-05-2019T15:25:25,CrimsonQuill,Ok
10-05-2019T15:25:40,CrimsonQuill,I think i can type now without bogging you down with a wall of text.
10-05-2019T15:25:50,CrimsonQuill,"So, Sage, what's the Gauntlet got to do with the story?"
10-05-2019T15:26:01,CrimsonQuill,Just I'm kind of confused by it.
10-05-2019T15:26:25,SageSaga,what's confusing about a gauntlet?
10-05-2019T15:26:39,Ordithus,You punch people with it
10-05-2019T15:26:44,BadFoMo,Loot to sell or spoilers?
10-05-2019T15:26:50,CrimsonQuill,Does it have anything about it?
10-05-2019T15:27:01,SageSaga,yeah its clearly a magical item right?
10-05-2019T15:27:08,CrimsonQuill,Ok
10-05-2019T15:27:15,CrimsonQuill,So...just a useful tool.
10-05-2019T15:27:33,Bgrmystr2,most things are.
10-05-2019T15:27:39,SageSaga,yep - it also proved that NPCs can use Adventurer gear
10-05-2019T15:27:53,CrimsonQuill,Oh-that changes things up nicely!
10-05-2019T15:28:06,CrimsonQuill,I'm playing Skyrim at the moment.
10-05-2019T15:28:18,CrimsonQuill,"So, I have a lot of RPG stuff on my mind."
10-05-2019T15:28:23,Bgrmystr2,I'm not sure why they wouldn't be able to. They're part of the world. It would seem weirder to me if they couldn't use it.
10-05-2019T15:28:46,SageSaga,many games have no way for NPCs to equip items at all
10-05-2019T15:29:04,Bgrmystr2,well yeah they're npcs. they're just standing around town and stuff lol
10-05-2019T15:29:41,SageSaga,so this is a game world- its possible that equipment for adventurers wouldnt work for NPCs
10-05-2019T15:29:43,BadFoMo,It improves your fist power. But DO NOT uses it for you know what; you'll rip it off.
10-05-2019T15:30:25,Sclimshady,Starting a lawnmower?
10-05-2019T15:30:45,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno, I chalk it up to npcs have no reason to need to wear it. It's kind of like asking some random dude in a city street to wear an iron plate or some kind of metal boot.. just why? lol"
10-05-2019T15:30:46,CrimsonQuill,OUCH.
10-05-2019T15:31:21,BadFoMo,Yes. Do you know how hard it is to find a replacement ripcorde?!
10-05-2019T15:31:28,CrimsonQuill,Yes.
10-05-2019T15:31:40,CrimsonQuill,I saw videos
10-05-2019T15:32:18,CrimsonQuill,urgh
10-05-2019T15:32:26,CrimsonQuill,I feel a bit tired

10-05-2019T16:20:37,SageSaga,good!
10-05-2019T16:20:55,SageSaga,it's looking like what it is
10-05-2019T16:21:00,SageSaga,i need it for a background element
10-05-2019T16:21:58,Bgrmystr2,"when I was looking at it before, I wasn't sure what it was, kinda looked like a bookcase or somesuch, but the barrels threw me off and I was doin the computer thing so I couldn't think about it, but those are alchohol barrels."
10-05-2019T16:22:46,SageSaga,casks
10-05-2019T16:24:26,Bgrmystr2,"ah okay, didn't know they had a name"
10-05-2019T16:27:50,BadFoMo,"If only I was here (and paying atention) while you were finishing them. Then I could have stared acting like The Great Cornholio and said ""Bungho---olyo! The all mighty Bungho---olyo!"". ...Aren't we lucky."

10-05-2019T16:37:10,Twokinds,Looks like a bowling alley
10-05-2019T16:37:19,BadFoMo,Hmm?
10-05-2019T16:37:24,BadFoMo,Oh.
10-05-2019T16:38:58,Ordithus,"A very expensive, fragile one"
10-05-2019T16:39:48,Twokinds,Do you think a poll with 72 option is excessive XD
10-05-2019T16:39:58,SageSaga,yes
10-05-2019T16:40:00,Ordithus,Yikes!
10-05-2019T16:40:07,BadFoMo,On Patreon?
10-05-2019T16:40:07,Bgrmystr2,christ
10-05-2019T16:40:09,Sclimshady,"Yeah, I think so"
10-05-2019T16:40:11,Twokinds,"I wanna try it, just to see how people react."
10-05-2019T16:40:29,Ordithus,I don't think people will like that
10-05-2019T16:40:31,Sclimshady,Some people just want to watch the world burn
10-05-2019T16:40:47,Ordithus,Tom is definitely one of them
10-05-2019T16:41:22,iliar,I'm not sure this will work. I think the voting system can fail with such a large pool.
10-05-2019T16:41:23,Sclimshady,Tom when he sees the world :ctwokinds-power:
10-05-2019T16:41:55,Twokinds,"Yeah, I guess so."
10-05-2019T16:42:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,2 polls with 36 options each?
10-05-2019T16:42:36,BadFoMo,Is there a hard limit of votes we can make this way?
10-05-2019T16:42:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Anyone on that can check my German on something real quick
10-05-2019T16:43:15,iliar,Perhaps in the new version of amenon something has changed. But I feel that there may be problems with very large pools.
10-05-2019T16:43:32,BadFoMo,"Also, didn't we try this bfore?"
10-05-2019T16:43:46,Bgrmystr2,anyone else having issues with the stream bufferin?
10-05-2019T16:43:49,BadFoMo,*before
10-05-2019T16:43:52,Twokinds,"I didn't mean with tkpolls, I meant google forms"
10-05-2019T16:43:52,MarvTheHugPharaoh,nope
10-05-2019T16:43:53,BadFoMo,I am.
10-05-2019T16:43:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Also hey. I’ll be on lunch soon
10-05-2019T16:44:00,Bgrmystr2,"yup, there it goes. it ded"
10-05-2019T16:44:00,MarvTheHugPharaoh,welp there is goes
10-05-2019T16:44:06,Ordithus,"Yeah, that's a problem"
10-05-2019T16:44:32,iliar,I would be careful with pools in which more than 62 options.
10-05-2019T16:45:07,iliar,Oh. I understood. With google-form should work.
10-05-2019T16:45:17,Ordithus,:csagesaga-c4:
10-05-2019T16:45:44,DonotaroAfterDark,@SageSaga Did you make the Gif in the top corner.
10-05-2019T16:45:56,Bgrmystr2,Maty made it
10-05-2019T16:45:58,iliar,Although I like thet kpolls alternative voting system.
10-05-2019T16:50:27,SageSaga,on the phone with isp
10-05-2019T16:51:24,BadFoMo,Inernational Space Police?!
10-05-2019T16:52:00,Ordithus,Good luck
10-05-2019T16:52:42,Bgrmystr2,ay you're back
10-05-2019T16:52:49,Bgrmystr2,..or not
10-05-2019T16:52:51,Twokinds,Sometimes I think tkpolls is intentionally designed to group suggestions poorly.
10-05-2019T16:53:07,Twokinds,"Like, every single reference sheet suggestion ends up in one round randomly."
10-05-2019T16:53:51,Sclimshady,Key word grouping preference?
10-05-2019T16:54:53,BadFoMo,And mine are almost always in the last round.
10-05-2019T16:55:39,Sclimshady,Mine are always first round
10-05-2019T16:55:50,Twokinds,Nah they sort completely randomly.
10-05-2019T16:55:57,Twokinds,Or at least as random as possible.
10-05-2019T16:56:13,Ordithus,Sometimes random doesn't feel random
10-05-2019T16:56:23,Twokinds,It's a 25% chance a suggestion ends up in 1 particular group.
10-05-2019T16:56:46,Bgrmystr2,"welp, strem ded again"
10-05-2019T16:57:03,iliar,"Yes, there is such a problem. However, this system is the most honest. I choose what I want to see. Not that which is more likely to win."
10-05-2019T16:57:41,Ordithus,Let's hope it keeps this time
10-05-2019T16:58:18,Ordithus,The alternative vote system is nice.  I wish actual elections were like that :P
10-05-2019T16:58:53,SageSaga,=_=
10-05-2019T16:59:10,SageSaga,they are going to send someone Thursday
10-05-2019T16:59:38,Bgrmystr2,to your house.. where you know the source of the problem isn't. 10/10 problem solving.
10-05-2019T17:00:07,BadFoMo,Back.
10-05-2019T17:00:17,Ordithus,wb fomo
10-05-2019T17:01:17,SageSaga,exactly - though once they confirm its not here they will look into the node - which could be part of the problem
10-05-2019T17:02:35,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
10-05-2019T17:03:32,Ordithus,"If it's not fixed for Friday, you should throttle your isp :ptv-snicker:"

10-05-2019T17:03:49,Ordithus,hi!
10-05-2019T17:03:54,SageSaga,I did have one time out occur once after it left my router- which could be the modem
10-05-2019T17:04:13,Dadrobit,Talking 'bout voting stuffs?
10-05-2019T17:04:49,BadFoMo,That and Sage's internet problems.
10-05-2019T17:04:55,FoxxTrotter,"Hi, Dadrobit."
10-05-2019T17:05:17,Ordithus,And the boozeshelf he's drawing

10-05-2019T17:07:43,Bgrmystr2,hmm
10-05-2019T17:07:57,Bgrmystr2,might actually be the modem?
10-05-2019T17:08:08,Bgrmystr2,or.. a mix of the modem and somewhere outside of your house as well
10-05-2019T17:08:14,BadFoMo,"Go home, Internet; you are drunk."
10-05-2019T17:09:20,SageSaga,that was weird- no time outs at all during that full on disconnect
10-05-2019T17:09:34,BadFoMo,Oh! Blue bottles. What's in thoes?
10-05-2019T17:09:58,SageSaga,caught some time outs big time here-
10-05-2019T17:10:10,SageSaga,first node total time out
