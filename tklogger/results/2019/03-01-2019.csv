03-01-2019T16:34:20,CrimsonQuill,Isn't that the game with the creepy glitches and weird stiff Jacksepticeye played?

03-01-2019T16:35:37,Mippy,I think so? That‚Äôs a pretty generic discription to be honest.

03-01-2019T16:38:56,Dadrobit,Sam and Colin will persevere.

03-01-2019T16:39:16,Mippy,Hoping cute will triumph this month
03-01-2019T16:39:32,CrimsonQuill,I'm going to try out my Subnautica crossover again.
03-01-2019T16:39:39,CrimsonQuill,"God, what is it with me and crossovers?"

03-01-2019T16:40:20,Mippy,Do some soal surching and you may find out
03-01-2019T16:40:59,Dadrobit,That might have a decent chance actually. Tom likes that game.
03-01-2019T16:41:22,Mippy,Soal....hehe...old English
03-01-2019T16:41:49,CrimsonQuill,@Dadrobit It's kind of what I'm hoping.
03-01-2019T16:41:59,CrimsonQuill,"But if it doesn't happen, that's ok"
03-01-2019T16:42:07,Mippy,I‚Äôm hoping people are in a cute+Kat mood
03-01-2019T16:42:24,CrRAR,ALWAYS
03-01-2019T16:42:27,CrimsonQuill,One of my resolutions is try not to obsess over one suggestion.
03-01-2019T16:42:28,Mippy,:ctwokinds-wink:
03-01-2019T16:42:55,CrimsonQuill,"I mean, Halo Raine got sketched (and coloured!) but I feel like I went a bit overboard trying to get her up..."
03-01-2019T16:43:12,CrimsonQuill,I'm still so glad she got picked in December...
03-01-2019T16:43:23,CrimsonQuill,"But with Subnautica, I won't push as hard."
03-01-2019T16:43:43,CrimsonQuill,I suppose I was just desperate to have at least one sketch suggestion to my name sketched...
03-01-2019T16:43:52,CrimsonQuill,:ctwokinds-lynnsmile:
03-01-2019T16:43:55,Mippy,Looks like you are already breaking that resolution Quill :csagesaga-nynasmirk: lol

03-01-2019T16:44:12,Dadrobit,It was picked in December? You're still in cooldown.
03-01-2019T16:44:23,CrimsonQuill,@Dadrobit Cooldown?
03-01-2019T16:44:28,CrimsonQuill,"Oh, I see."
03-01-2019T16:44:45,CrimsonQuill,It was picked at the start of the month..
03-01-2019T16:44:49,Dadrobit,One month past getting a suggestion through before you can suggest again.
03-01-2019T16:44:55,CrimsonQuill,I see that.
03-01-2019T16:44:56,Mippy,Still obsessed with Raine. :ctwokinds-NataniHAHA: Good ol‚Äô Quill
03-01-2019T16:45:07,Dadrobit,And video games
03-01-2019T16:45:10,CrimsonQuill,She IS my favourite...:ctwokinds-rainehappy:
03-01-2019T16:45:18,CrimsonQuill,It's kind of odd.
03-01-2019T16:45:25,CrimsonQuill,Tigers are my favourite animal...
03-01-2019T16:45:41,CrimsonQuill,"But Raine's my favourite character, and her Keidran form is a wolf."
03-01-2019T16:45:50,CrimsonQuill,"To be honest, it doesn't matter,"
03-01-2019T16:46:24,CrimsonQuill,But yeah-Raine and Video games. Nicely put Dad.

03-01-2019T17:01:25,CrimsonQuill,He's a bit like Dumbledore from Harry Potter.

03-01-2019T17:14:28,Dadrobit,Deception is not necessarily wrong.
03-01-2019T17:15:10,Dadrobit,He went in with the intention of deceiving every human simply for self preservation.

03-01-2019T17:19:54,Xexanoth,but he doesn't

03-01-2019T17:22:25,Dadrobit,"""I'm mugging you at knife point... It's just a prank cuz."""
03-01-2019T17:22:58,Dadrobit,"""You shouldn't follow your dreams."""
03-01-2019T17:23:16,CrimsonQuill,"Hmm...well, she was very much afraid for his safety."
03-01-2019T17:23:29,CrimsonQuill,I know nobody in the comic's perfect...
03-01-2019T17:23:39,CrimsonQuill,I just see Euchre as a mixture.
03-01-2019T17:23:55,Dadrobit,"""I know you're busy following your dreams and all, but I want to come and visit knowing that if I'm caught I'll be executed and will do everything I can to incriminate you as well."""
03-01-2019T17:24:27,CrimsonQuill,"@Dadrobit if you're forgetting, Mary took all the information from her mind."
03-01-2019T17:24:57,CrimsonQuill,"And in all her appearences, Rose doesn't really show what we'd consider malice..."
03-01-2019T17:25:09,Dadrobit,You're forgetting how she was calling out his name from the gallows.
03-01-2019T17:25:19,CrimsonQuill,Self-preservation.
03-01-2019T17:25:36,CrimsonQuill,"She knew he was her only chance of survival, and was desperate."
03-01-2019T17:26:01,Dadrobit,And going under the guise of a human was Euchre's.
03-01-2019T17:26:10,CrimsonQuill,Euchre did have a point in criticizing a system willing to execute someone simply SUSPECTED of being spy without trial.
03-01-2019T17:26:16,Bgrmystr2,calling someone you know is there when they're about to execute you is not malice
03-01-2019T17:26:29,CrimsonQuill,She was on a knofe edge.
03-01-2019T17:26:32,CrimsonQuill,Knife
03-01-2019T17:26:42,CrimsonQuill,Clutching at straws.
03-01-2019T17:26:47,Dadrobit,Literally nothing she's done in the comic proper has been altruistic.
03-01-2019T17:26:57,CrimsonQuill,Objection.
03-01-2019T17:27:03,Dadrobit,Denied
03-01-2019T17:27:05,Bgrmystr2,"Honestly, I don't think Anything she's ever done is out of malice. At all."
03-01-2019T17:27:37,Dadrobit,"Maybe not malice, but is an malice borne of being an ignorant ass much better?"
03-01-2019T17:27:51,Bgrmystr2,"Stupidity and lack of thinking things through is not malace, bro"
03-01-2019T17:28:10,Dadrobit,"But she also has done nothing properly ""good"" eihter."
03-01-2019T17:28:12,Dadrobit,either*
03-01-2019T17:28:14,CrimsonQuill,One must consider that said ignorance might be the result of withheld information.
03-01-2019T17:28:22,CrimsonQuill,And 'properly good'?
03-01-2019T17:28:25,Dadrobit,Literally nothing.
03-01-2019T17:28:43,CrimsonQuill,"Again, I beg to differ."
03-01-2019T17:29:08,Dadrobit,Show me the page where she was altruistic and not just serving Trace and the manor.
03-01-2019T17:29:11,CrimsonQuill,"The very fact that she's trying to help Trace figure out what sort of past he's up against is quite brave on her part, considering the risks."
03-01-2019T17:29:53,CrimsonQuill,"Also, consider that the only reason she remained in the Legacy estate was that she was a reminder of Saria."
03-01-2019T17:30:17,CrimsonQuill,"And she states that during his evil streak, trace was very secretive."
03-01-2019T17:30:58,CrimsonQuill,So she wouldn't have known half of what went on behind closed doors.
03-01-2019T17:31:38,Dadrobit,So she's an exposition bot. That's not doing anything good. That's just delivering information. And at Trace's request.
03-01-2019T17:32:15,Dadrobit,And against Euchre's wishes.
03-01-2019T17:32:41,CrimsonQuill,No one has any idea as to what could happen if Trace sees whatever's on that floor.
03-01-2019T17:33:27,CrimsonQuill,"Anyhow, as soon as Euchre urged it not to be seen, my inner genre savvy sensed that it will be seen."
03-01-2019T17:33:38,CrimsonQuill,But that's by the by.
03-01-2019T17:33:51,Dadrobit,"""Hey, see how new Trace is all not murdery? We ca keep him that way be denying him his past."" Rose immediately starts helping Trace dig through his past."

03-01-2019T17:34:16,CrimsonQuill,Trace wants to find out about his past to see what madman he's up against.
03-01-2019T17:35:01,CrimsonQuill,We just haven't seen quite enough of Rose yet to fully guage her personality and motives.
03-01-2019T17:35:11,CrimsonQuill,I look forward to seeing what happens.
03-01-2019T17:35:20,CrimsonQuill,I consider her inherently a good person.
03-01-2019T17:35:27,CrimsonQuill,Just in a tight spot.
03-01-2019T17:35:33,Mippy,:ctwokinds-rose: Do I have motivation?

03-01-2019T17:36:00,CrimsonQuill,Mission brief for Roselyn of Legacy Estate.
03-01-2019T17:36:09,Dadrobit,Euchre literally told her that it's because Trace is largely ignorant that Euchre is able to keep him under control. So Rose just to fuck over Euchre risks bringing back ~Literally Hitler~ by doing exactly what Euchre told her to avoid doing.
03-01-2019T17:36:45,Dadrobit,http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/1021/
03-01-2019T17:37:24,CrimsonQuill,"Ok, that's a tad over the top. Rose is not doing that despite Euchre."
03-01-2019T17:37:35,Dadrobit,"Rose is a person who has been witness firsthand what Evil Trace did, and she's willing to bring that back just to spite him."
03-01-2019T17:37:43,Mippy,She could be :ctwokinds-floraquestion:
03-01-2019T17:37:44,CrimsonQuill,Not true.
03-01-2019T17:38:28,Mippy,"Well, have to Waite and see"
03-01-2019T17:38:29,CrimsonQuill,I believe both that Rose is hoping that Trace is truly changed enough to turn things around.
03-01-2019T17:38:58,Mippy,Only Tom knows for sure...I think...how far ahead do Tom plan?
03-01-2019T17:39:10,Dadrobit,You're projecting you're own fantasy version of what you want Rose to be onto what she has actually shown us Quill.
03-01-2019T17:39:23,CrimsonQuill,"Bear in mind also that the fact that he recognises his evil side as a seperate entity ('Evil black smoke hallucination'), there may yet be a chance for him to come out..."
03-01-2019T17:39:42,CrimsonQuill,I'm not trying to project any version of Rose onto anything.
03-01-2019T17:40:00,CrimsonQuill,I am merely trying to state that she is not a nasty person.
03-01-2019T17:40:06,Dadrobit,"Tom knows the comic to the end, and how each chapter is going to play out. But he does write the individual pages by the seat of his pants."
03-01-2019T17:40:23,Mippy,Ahhhh....
03-01-2019T17:40:28,CrimsonQuill,What will be is unknown.
03-01-2019T17:40:50,CrimsonQuill,I don't know what happens next.
03-01-2019T17:41:11,Dadrobit,Rose is not a good person. Content of fluff on the outside does not equate to the content of goodness within.
03-01-2019T17:41:12,CrimsonQuill,But I'm glad I'm able to watch it pan out as it's drawn!
03-01-2019T17:41:32,CrimsonQuill,@Dadrobit I'm not trying to say that.
03-01-2019T17:41:41,CrimsonQuill,And she is inherently alright.
03-01-2019T17:42:02,CrimsonQuill,"Look at her behaviour throughout the comic, and 'The Dragon masquerade', which is canon."
03-01-2019T17:42:16,Dadrobit,TDM is only B Canon
03-01-2019T17:42:18,Mippy,....
03-01-2019T17:42:26,CrimsonQuill,What does B canon mean?
03-01-2019T17:42:59,Dadrobit,It is only canon to the extent that it is not then overwritten by the main story.
03-01-2019T17:43:06,Mippy,It means you will B a cannon...
03-01-2019T17:43:27,CrimsonQuill,Does that make it any less relevant?
03-01-2019T17:43:29,Dadrobit,Rose was somewhat more kind in TDM. But she has shown little to none of that in the main comic.
03-01-2019T17:43:36,Xexanoth,@Dad any yet in the page you posted i mostly see euchre trying to manipulate someone for his own gain....
03-01-2019T17:43:46,CrimsonQuill,She had a facade to maintain.
03-01-2019T17:43:56,Xexanoth,"it's for ""his"" plan to succeed"
03-01-2019T17:43:57,CrimsonQuill,And Trace accidentally cracked it.

03-01-2019T17:44:30,Dadrobit,Euchre is trying to get Rose to help him stop Hitler from coming back. Are you actually trying to demonize that???
03-01-2019T17:44:47,CrimsonQuill,No.
03-01-2019T17:44:47,Xexanoth,i'm trying to demonize his motives
03-01-2019T17:44:55,Mippy,:ctwokinds-sadtrace2: Hitler...
03-01-2019T17:45:05,Xexanoth,he doesn't want trace back because it's good for HIM
03-01-2019T17:45:34,CrimsonQuill,"That said, I believe that the moment, in any story, someone says that something musn't be revealed, then the narrative ENSURES it will be revealed."
03-01-2019T17:45:43,CrimsonQuill,It's narrative causality.
03-01-2019T17:45:59,CrimsonQuill,"@Xexanoth not wuite true, he IS thinking about the species as a whole."
03-01-2019T17:46:03,Dadrobit,It's good for every keidran. Not just him.

03-01-2019T21:44:07,totallynotTrace,we americans still dont know what Lone is talking about
03-01-2019T21:44:17,totallynotTrace,like what country?
03-01-2019T21:44:21,Mippy,Not in Canada
03-01-2019T21:44:40,totallynotTrace,so... Europe?
03-01-2019T21:44:57,Mippy,Mozambique?
03-01-2019T21:45:02,IceMagic,Africa?
03-01-2019T21:45:06,LoneWolfZitsue,National Insurance is for every country
03-01-2019T21:45:08,IceMagic,We will guess it eventually
03-01-2019T21:45:14,ShadowSoap,o.O
03-01-2019T21:45:22,totallynotTrace,not in the USA
03-01-2019T21:45:32,Mippy,I have a job and I‚Äôve never heard of if
03-01-2019T21:45:34,LoneWolfZitsue,"For Europe we call it National Insurance, I can‚Äôt remember what it‚Äôs called in America"
03-01-2019T21:45:35,Mippy,It
03-01-2019T21:46:04,Bgrmystr2,it's not a thing here in the US. Lone
03-01-2019T21:46:07,Bgrmystr2,FYI
03-01-2019T21:46:11,LoneWolfZitsue,But if u don‚Äôt have it your unlikely not to get a single job
03-01-2019T21:46:15,Bgrmystr2,You don't need anything to actually have a job.
03-01-2019T21:46:22,Mippy,Social Insurance Number?
03-01-2019T21:46:47,LoneWolfZitsue,U do it‚Äôs just depends on what job for instance to be a chef u need a National Insurance
03-01-2019T21:47:29,SageSaga,its basically a tax ID right?
03-01-2019T21:47:34,LoneWolfZitsue,U get it when your half way through 15 or at 16 years of age
03-01-2019T21:47:35,Rosscoe,"Oh I see, yea here in Canada its called Social Insurance."
03-01-2019T21:47:48,Bgrmystr2,Yeah naw
03-01-2019T21:47:58,LoneWolfZitsue,Yea and in Europe it‚Äôs called National Insurance
03-01-2019T21:48:09,Bgrmystr2,that's not a thing
03-01-2019T21:48:22,totallynotTrace,"yeah no, to be a chef in the us you just need to be old enough to pay tax (16 basically but depends on state) and also be a legal resident"
03-01-2019T21:48:30,Bgrmystr2,^
03-01-2019T21:48:31,SageSaga,the US doesnt have that- but we sorta use SSNs for that
03-01-2019T21:48:41,Bgrmystr2,SSNs are at birth though
03-01-2019T21:48:45,SageSaga,yep
03-01-2019T21:48:56,Bgrmystr2,and only used for like.. super important stuff like banking
03-01-2019T21:48:58,SageSaga,but we use it for the same purpose
03-01-2019T21:49:02,LoneWolfZitsue,Oh well every country is different
03-01-2019T21:49:04,Bgrmystr2,to verify it's you
03-01-2019T21:49:13,KOLFreak,pretty much
03-01-2019T21:49:15,Mippy,"Yeah, for a SIN you don‚Äôt have to be a particular age either"
03-01-2019T21:49:23,ShadowSoap,"In New York, you need working papers if you want a job between the ages of 14 and 17."
03-01-2019T21:49:23,Terryschannel,Hello everyone
03-01-2019T21:49:33,Bgrmystr2,"I've never had a job ask me for my SSN, and no jobs around here do either"
03-01-2019T21:49:33,Rosscoe,I know in Canada every job I ever had your Social Insurance number was needed
03-01-2019T21:49:41,totallynotTrace,yup. basically as sage just said SSN are needed as they prove you are a legal resident and then a minimum age but thats generally 16 or defined by state
03-01-2019T21:49:41,Bgrmystr2,"it's always for like, banking and such"
03-01-2019T21:49:48,Rosscoe,"UNless its a ma and pa ran place,"
03-01-2019T21:51:03,Mippy,Meh :ctwokinds-FloDance:
03-01-2019T21:51:12,MuonNeutrino,"the job doesn't necessarily ask for the SSN, but they end up with it anyway for tax stuff"

03-01-2019T21:53:46,MuonNeutrino,"take the boots off and carry them, then put them back on once you're outside"
03-01-2019T21:53:52,Rosscoe,"No way I'm moving her, shes gota be like 300 pounds"
03-01-2019T21:53:58,Mippy,I don‚Äôt quite understand..it‚Äôs the sofa blocking the soor

03-01-2019T22:11:39,ZephyrTWolffox,"I still game, just casually."
03-01-2019T22:11:47,ZephyrTWolffox,I'm not all serious about it
03-01-2019T22:11:49,unsteddyphoenix,"No Zro, youre supposed to call HIM trash now"
03-01-2019T22:11:54,unsteddyphoenix,Youre doing it all wrong
03-01-2019T22:11:58,Mippy,Yup...kind of proud of it. Gonna try and keep it up
03-01-2019T22:12:07,ZRO4825,"I detest trash-talking, therefore, I suck at it. ^_^"
03-01-2019T22:12:12,unsteddyphoenix,Proud of..playing video games?

03-01-2019T22:12:59,Mippy,Yup... and finishing them! I have a bad habit of not finishing games. :csagesaga-c1:
03-01-2019T22:13:19,unsteddyphoenix,Ohh. Yeah I do that too~
03-01-2019T22:13:31,LoneWolfZitsue,So u represent a lot of YouTubers
03-01-2019T22:13:44,unsteddyphoenix,I did like 95% of the witcher 2 then never finished it
03-01-2019T22:13:47,unsteddyphoenix,For...some reason
03-01-2019T22:13:50,LoneWolfZitsue,Who don‚Äôt finish their gameplay üòë
03-01-2019T22:13:55,ZRO4825,I refuse to expand on the issue of unfinished games...let alone the list of games I own but haven't touched yet <_<;;;
03-01-2019T22:14:05,ZahnHolley,My uncle is born from the 70s and he grew up playing games in the late 80s
03-01-2019T22:14:07,ZRO4825,"(Humble Bundle as been GREAT at increasing that second number, btw)"
03-01-2019T22:14:10,Mippy,I‚Äôm about there with Arkham Asylum
03-01-2019T22:14:27,FatCowMom,Last game I finished was all of SoulCalVI's story modes
03-01-2019T22:14:35,Mippy,Not quite done...but almost
03-01-2019T22:14:45,ZRO4825,The entire Arkham series imo is worth finishing. Though I need to quite being lazy and go 100% Arkham Knight.
03-01-2019T22:14:49,ZRO4825,quit*
03-01-2019T22:14:53,ZRO4825,jeez I can't type lately.
03-01-2019T22:15:01,ShadowSoap,Just finished a replay of OneShot. One of the best games I've played.
03-01-2019T22:15:05,unsteddyphoenix,ooh I wanna play soul cal man
03-01-2019T22:15:05,LoneWolfZitsue,U guys to try playing a game called ‚ÄòNight In The Woods‚Äô
03-01-2019T22:15:10,unsteddyphoenix,I heard they added 2B somehow
03-01-2019T22:15:18,ZRO4825,They did
03-01-2019T22:15:30,ZRO4825,"And yes, she's just as much fun to look at in SoulCal as she is in Nier <3"
03-01-2019T22:16:10,ZahnHolley,Is the night in the woods any fun? I never played it i allways miss out on things.
03-01-2019T22:16:17,FatCowMom,They did add 2B
03-01-2019T22:16:18,ZRO4825,"They did a good job bringing her fighting style into SoulCalibur as well, her combo potential is crazy"
03-01-2019T22:16:41,Mippy,I‚Äôm just not a great stealth type...XD Sneaking around as a guy as big as Batman is difficult
03-01-2019T22:16:47,FatCowMom,Yeah and she's not OP from how easy it is to counter her
03-01-2019T22:16:50,MviluUatusun,Well everyone.  It's well past my bedtime so I'll see y'all next time.
03-01-2019T22:16:57,LoneWolfZitsue,Search the trailer on YouTube

03-01-2019T22:17:15,Mippy,I‚Äôll have to look at Night in the Woods...never heard of it.
03-01-2019T22:17:17,LoneWolfZitsue,It‚Äôs worth the money and time playing and finishing the game
03-01-2019T22:17:19,ZahnHolley,Bye mvilu
03-01-2019T22:17:55,Mippy,"I‚Äôve got to finish Fran Bow, Undertale, and Dust first before I pick up anything new."
03-01-2019T22:17:56,Mihari,"So Ron, when does she get her wireless charging module, it's 2019 for petesake!"
03-01-2019T22:18:05,ZRO4825,lol
03-01-2019T22:18:09,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"I just got an email, apparently Tom is streaming"
03-01-2019T22:18:15,Mihari,She's not even USB-C
03-01-2019T22:18:26,Bgrmystr2,there's barely anything that's USB type C
03-01-2019T22:18:28,Bgrmystr2,even now
03-01-2019T22:18:35,Mihari,That's completely false
03-01-2019T22:18:43,SageSaga,yeah theres tons of USB-C stuff
03-01-2019T22:18:44,Twokinds,"that - that is accurate, yes."
03-01-2019T22:18:59,Mihari,I will curse your character tomorrow Tom!
03-01-2019T22:19:02,unsteddyphoenix,"Oh damn, is it?"
03-01-2019T22:19:03,Bgrmystr2,just because there's some things that are USB C doesn't mean it's widespread.
03-01-2019T22:19:20,MarvTheHugPharaoh,half of what I use is type c
03-01-2019T22:19:22,Bgrmystr2,Most things are still USB 3.0 or 3.1 from what I've seen
03-01-2019T22:19:23,Mippy,:ctwokinds-kingtea:
03-01-2019T22:19:27,Mihari,No one said anything about it being widespread despite it being very widespread
03-01-2019T22:19:29,totallynotTrace,I would say its widespread
03-01-2019T22:19:31,ZRO4825,I don't have a single thing that's USB-C
03-01-2019T22:19:34,ZahnHolley,"Im losing patience because my pocket brush pen didnt come yet darnit i waited all week for this,"
03-01-2019T22:19:53,Terryschannel,Does chat autoscroll for anyone else?

03-01-2019T22:20:03,Mihari,I'm aware :P
03-01-2019T22:20:04,ZRO4825,"Well, it's kinda supposed to, Terry"
03-01-2019T22:20:04,unsteddyphoenix,"""back in myyyy day"""
03-01-2019T22:20:08,Mihari,But I can still tease you about it.
03-01-2019T22:20:14,Nekonny,And wireless chargeing wasn't a thing
03-01-2019T22:20:17,SageSaga,almost every tablet now has USB C every current computer and laptop
03-01-2019T22:20:19,Mippy,Yes Terry...that is normal
03-01-2019T22:20:24,Mihari,And well you're working on it now.
03-01-2019T22:20:27,SageSaga,and almost every current cell
03-01-2019T22:20:30,totallynotTrace,I dont have anything thats usb c but thats cuz i havent bought anything in about a year and even then it was an accessory not the full device
03-01-2019T22:20:35,Terryschannel,Thanks
03-01-2019T22:20:42,ZRO4825,"My PC has a USB-C slot on the back. But I don't have anything that uses it, lol"
03-01-2019T22:21:02,CrRAR,haha
03-01-2019T22:21:10,Mihari,"Yes Ron, I know when it came out."
03-01-2019T22:21:27,Bgrmystr2,"yay so motherboards and stuff have Type C, but besides phones and stuff, what else really uses it"
03-01-2019T22:21:31,Mihari,"But I should point out if she's ordering a giant robot, she can order a wireless charging module!"
03-01-2019T22:21:48,Nekonny,look at those specs!
03-01-2019T22:21:58,CrRAR,firewire... aww yeah

03-01-2019T22:23:05,ZRO4825,XD
03-01-2019T22:23:05,CrRAR,ahh the 9800 XT
03-01-2019T22:23:19,Nekonny,its built into her cpu
03-01-2019T22:23:27,SageSaga,. . .
03-01-2019T22:23:27,Nekonny,which is that computer behind her
03-01-2019T22:23:38,SageSaga,that is a computer tower not a CPU
03-01-2019T22:23:39,CrRAR,I remember I almost bought the 9800 All-in-wonder with the capture features
03-01-2019T22:23:53,Nekonny,sorry
03-01-2019T22:23:55,Bgrmystr2,in b4 it's LITERALLY just a box containing a CPU
03-01-2019T22:24:01,SageSaga,you cant build a DVD player into a CPU
03-01-2019T22:24:02,Bgrmystr2,it's just A GIANT processor
03-01-2019T22:24:05,Nekonny,she's just an avatar; her software runs on the machine
03-01-2019T22:24:12,Bgrmystr2,aw :(
03-01-2019T22:24:19,CrRAR,"look, she's got a tablet!"
03-01-2019T22:24:27,CrRAR,predictin' the future!
03-01-2019T22:24:28,Tamerlee,My mouse is my printer
03-01-2019T22:24:38,SageSaga,that tablet probably has more ram than her
03-01-2019T22:24:50,CrRAR,lol
03-01-2019T22:24:54,Nekonny,it's an apple cinema display
03-01-2019T22:25:04,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, for all that, she could just have screens in her eyes.. Why would she need a visual representation when she's a computer and can do things digitally"
03-01-2019T22:25:06,Nekonny,wireless display? XD
03-01-2019T22:25:26,CrRAR,"beeeeg dollars, itsy bitsy screen space~"
03-01-2019T22:25:41,CrRAR,ooh nice thubscrew there on the boot
03-01-2019T22:26:17,Nekonny,it's a way for her to interact with the world ^^'
03-01-2019T22:26:34,ZahnHolley,Wasnt digital art first invented since the 90s ? I really dont know.
03-01-2019T22:26:56,SageSaga,you upgraded her hair- upgrade her specs
03-01-2019T22:27:05,Mihari,Why would you argue about how dated something is when you're actively working on it?
03-01-2019T22:27:18,unsteddyphoenix,:thinking:
03-01-2019T22:27:35,Mippy,I think there were a few less advanced programs before the ‚Äò90‚Äôs  Zahn
03-01-2019T22:27:39,Nekonny,true sage
03-01-2019T22:27:51,Mihari,"If you're putting this out there today, put her in 'today'!"
03-01-2019T22:28:00,Bgrmystr2,"perhaps she's outdated just.. in general, and the new generation has all the gizmos"
03-01-2019T22:28:01,Mippy,Holy Crap! MS Paint!
03-01-2019T22:28:03,ZahnHolley,Oh that figures
03-01-2019T22:28:09,Nekonny,"But mihari; you are sugesting that I change her plug to usb c, now that Ive drawn out the whole comic"
03-01-2019T22:28:10,unsteddyphoenix,Thats ok
03-01-2019T22:28:24,Mihari,"You don't need to change her plug, there is Type-A"
03-01-2019T22:28:30,ZephyrTWolffox,remembers when Photoshop didn't even have layers
03-01-2019T22:28:44,ZephyrTWolffox,I'm outdated.
03-01-2019T22:28:44,Nekonny,So what Do I need to change?
03-01-2019T22:28:54,Mihari,The port colour would be the only thing
03-01-2019T22:28:56,Nekonny,"I mean of course, her specs could be updated"
03-01-2019T22:29:05,Nekonny,oh yeah
03-01-2019T22:29:06,Mihari,It would be teal
03-01-2019T22:29:09,Nekonny,make it blue?
03-01-2019T22:29:11,Mihari,teal
03-01-2019T22:29:12,Mippy,I made some pretty epic things in MS Paint
03-01-2019T22:29:13,totallynotTrace,"wait, is Zephyr saying modern photoshop is like an Ogre?"
03-01-2019T22:29:21,Nekonny,teal? I haent even seen those yet
03-01-2019T22:29:24,SageSaga,Pro tip- dont actually give specs
03-01-2019T22:29:24,Nekonny,huh
03-01-2019T22:29:34,Nekonny,that is true sage
03-01-2019T22:29:52,Nekonny,giveing specs just meand that it will be outdated in a year or ttwo
03-01-2019T22:30:04,Bgrmystr2,Or make them fake specs that don't actually relate to anything in the real world
03-01-2019T22:30:04,Mihari,"Eh, go with USB 3 blue safe bet there"
03-01-2019T22:30:26,SageSaga,it also frustrates techies like myself and Mihari
03-01-2019T22:30:47,Bgrmystr2,lol sage pls
03-01-2019T22:31:28,SageSaga,what do you want?

03-01-2019T22:32:21,ZephyrTWolffox,I want Taco Pizza.
03-01-2019T22:32:22,Mippy,(Or a fur suit)
03-01-2019T22:32:26,Bgrmystr2,Just ordinary maid would be fine.
03-01-2019T22:32:34,Bgrmystr2,no mippy. xD

03-01-2019T22:32:50,Terryschannel,I want nibbly slippers
03-01-2019T22:33:02,Bgrmystr2,yknow.. just having an ordinary cat just jumping around your house actually cleaning stuff up would be the greatest thing.
