06-06-2019T13:33:47,FloofyCat,"I just realised there's a Twokinds Wikia, is it official in any way? :o"
06-06-2019T13:53:07,TerraTheWizard,"i didn't know there was a wikia, i just use this one https://twokinds.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page"
06-06-2019T14:31:39,AspiringNoodle,How you know you've made it as a webcomic artist
06-06-2019T14:31:44,AspiringNoodle,1) Fan-made wiki
06-06-2019T14:31:52,AspiringNoodle,2) Bad Webcomics Wiki entry
06-06-2019T14:32:21,AspiringNoodle,3) Stalkers?
06-06-2019T15:01:02,TerraTheWizard,that bad webcomics wiki is super out of date iirc
06-06-2019T15:01:11,TerraTheWizard,and there was some episode of something too
06-06-2019T15:01:25,TerraTheWizard,but they only base it on like the first 100 or so pages
06-06-2019T15:10:10,AspiringNoodle,They do go back and re-review some comics if they go on long enough.  I think they did it for Tom
06-06-2019T15:10:20,AspiringNoodle,"That said, I can't remember *when* they did it, though."

06-06-2019T16:48:32,SpazztasticKiwi,got out of my car next to another with a group of guys. Most immediate case of dead silence I’ve ever seen
06-06-2019T16:48:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I think I snuck up on them
06-06-2019T16:52:17,TerraTheWizard,lol
06-06-2019T17:07:56,AspiringNoodle,We are in agreement then

06-06-2019T17:57:13,Bgrmystr2,probably not.

06-06-2019T18:54:47,SpazztasticKiwi,I got at least three ideas
06-06-2019T18:55:11,SpazztasticKiwi,likely gonna be Flora tickles
06-06-2019T19:02:50,AspiringNoodle,I kinda wanna see what happens if you put something on Flora's head :P
06-06-2019T19:03:00,AspiringNoodle,Will Flora.exe fail to respond?
06-06-2019T19:27:05,AspiringNoodle,"34 - 40 minutes until stream, so amped :ptv-hearts:"
06-06-2019T19:28:40,Orthonox,Curious if it is a comic or nora card stream. Betting the latter
06-06-2019T19:30:23,AspiringNoodle,"When we reach the 2000th Nora card, will a space-time event occur and she appears in our reality?"
06-06-2019T19:30:40,AspiringNoodle,THAT WOULD BE AWESOME :ptv-excited:
06-06-2019T19:34:39,Bgrmystr2,Probably nora card since I think tom said he was already done with the comic page
06-06-2019T19:34:46,Bgrmystr2,and he hasn't posted it yet that I know of
06-06-2019T19:58:47,Orthonox,He did finished the Comic page from last week's stream. Just that he did not post for reasons I do not know other than being busy.
06-06-2019T20:00:00,AspiringNoodle,Nora's been sleeping on him recently.  Eating into work time.
06-06-2019T20:01:43,AspiringNoodle,Aw yes

06-06-2019T20:12:20,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Orthonox
06-06-2019T20:13:58,SageSaga,I bought a water bottle for Anthrocon
06-06-2019T20:14:26,Mippy,"Good, after all...water is the water of life"
06-06-2019T20:14:41,SageSaga,my tumbler is great and all but i dont trust it if i have to keep it on the floor
06-06-2019T20:14:52,SageSaga,if i kick it- im sure its not gonna matter if the cap was on
06-06-2019T20:14:58,SageSaga,but this thing is a tank

06-06-2019T20:17:54,Mippy,Too bad I won't be at a con
06-06-2019T20:17:57,SageSaga,that coating is expensive
06-06-2019T20:18:23,Twokinds,It was difficult to animate this in Photoshop.
06-06-2019T20:18:37,Zakuru,yay
06-06-2019T20:18:51,Twokinds,I had to animate the shine using a mask and then animate the rotation. But it's fun.
06-06-2019T20:19:10,Zakuru,ooooo
06-06-2019T20:19:14,Zakuru,fauncy~
06-06-2019T20:19:18,Orthonox,That looks nice. I certainly would buy the Mike (OG) print.
06-06-2019T20:19:29,Orthonox,If I Had Money!
06-06-2019T20:20:30,Orthonox,I do like how content Mike is in this print.
06-06-2019T20:20:44,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Tom, is this gonna be for sale online?"
06-06-2019T20:20:45,Bgrmystr2,"the shine looks very pretty but also blocks the image from being seen straight-on, which kinda kills it for me. I know a real one doesn't work like that though, so no big deal."
06-06-2019T20:22:09,Bgrmystr2,yeah that looks really nice
06-06-2019T20:22:38,Bgrmystr2,"if I could go, I'd absolutely get one"
06-06-2019T20:22:41,InTheLionsDen,The many shapes of Mike

06-06-2019T20:24:44,AspiringNoodle,Simple solution:  Build a glass wall in a big room.  Hand double-sided posters.
06-06-2019T20:24:45,Bgrmystr2,I mean.. or I could get one of the other ones instead :ptv-wondering:

06-06-2019T20:30:32,Bgrmystr2,It is though?
06-06-2019T20:30:46,Bgrmystr2,You have to make the window less wide

06-06-2019T20:33:41,ContagiousBordem16,In the chat

06-06-2019T20:34:24,ContagiousBordem16,Nah she’s told old ain’t she?
06-06-2019T20:34:57,AspiringNoodle,"To be fair, I remember Feral being described as reverting to only baser instincts"

06-06-2019T20:35:07,ContagiousBordem16,At any age?
06-06-2019T20:35:09,Orthonox,Is there an age cut off point for being feral? She looks rather young in this sketch.
06-06-2019T20:35:11,AspiringNoodle,Whereas Slightly Damned's berserk state is a murderous rage.
06-06-2019T20:35:22,w0lfmare,o/

06-06-2019T21:19:28,SpazztasticKiwi,or maybe she’s in front of a green screen and someone told her Red tracked mud on her fresh mopped kitchen
06-06-2019T21:19:54,AspiringNoodle,"She's a 2000 year old dragon, possibly the most powerful dragon EVER.  Do you think anyone is gonna say ""no"" to her?"
06-06-2019T21:20:19,Sclimshady,Trace will
06-06-2019T21:20:26,NezumiYuki,"LOL well Trace tries... Now whether or not he wins, that is debatable.  xD"
06-06-2019T21:20:27,AspiringNoodle,"They *could*, but I doubt they'd expect her to actually listen."
06-06-2019T21:20:35,Dadrobit,That's kinda rape-y...
06-06-2019T21:20:56,AspiringNoodle,1st rule of dealing with Nora: Nora does whatever she wants.
06-06-2019T21:21:06,AspiringNoodle,2nd rule of dealing with Nora: Refer to the first rule.
06-06-2019T21:21:13,steelabjur,Calling in to work because you're pinned under a dragon.
06-06-2019T21:21:48,InTheLionsDen,A dragon fell asleep on my homework.
06-06-2019T21:21:54,Dadrobit,"Shit, my job'd still tell me to shrug it off and come in lol."
06-06-2019T21:22:08,AspiringNoodle,"Trace's coworkers: ""She wants the D."""
06-06-2019T21:22:13,NezumiYuki,Trace Legacy:  How to put up with your She Dragon....
06-06-2019T21:22:14,AspiringNoodle,"""Oh yeah, she wants it so bad."""
06-06-2019T21:22:58,steelabjur,"Heh, were you here for the last stream where there was a situation like this?"
06-06-2019T21:23:08,AspiringNoodle,"That said, cute sleeping Nora is outstandingly wholesome :ptv-hearts:"
06-06-2019T21:23:41,AspiringNoodle,THAT nora was not wholesome.  Not at all.  It was 11/10 LEWD :ptv-ohmy:
06-06-2019T21:24:05,AspiringNoodle,And Trace was -1 / 10 interest xD
06-06-2019T21:24:08,NezumiYuki,What?!?!?  Only 11/10?
06-06-2019T21:24:08,Ordithus,"What do you mean?  She was wearing the same thing, doing the same thing as now"
06-06-2019T21:24:22,steelabjur,"""Dragon Butt"""
06-06-2019T21:24:32,AspiringNoodle,"We're talking about the one where she shapeshifts into a nekkid adrakist lady so she can sleep with Trace, right?"
06-06-2019T21:24:47,steelabjur,Yes.
06-06-2019T21:24:53,Ordithus,She was already sleeping on him :ptv-snicker:
06-06-2019T21:25:20,NezumiYuki,Let sleeping dragons lie
06-06-2019T21:25:49,steelabjur,"Trace complained she was too heavy, so she shapeshifted to humanoid form. He still complained about her weight."
06-06-2019T21:26:13,Ordithus,how rude
06-06-2019T21:26:27,AspiringNoodle,"She's a dragon, she can be whatever weight she wants."
06-06-2019T21:27:36,Dadrobit,"Iirc, Tom mentioned that their mass stays constant independent of their current shape, so she'd likely feel much heavier sleeping as a bipedal on top of him."
06-06-2019T21:27:49,AspiringNoodle,Holy s***
06-06-2019T21:27:55,AspiringNoodle,Those shelves in Eric's ship must've been MAGIC
06-06-2019T21:28:05,Ordithus,In which case the shelf in that one Valentine's comic is uber strong
06-06-2019T21:28:23,Twokinds,No I didn't
06-06-2019T21:28:36,Dadrobit,Though the canonical verifiability of that is questionable considering she was a cat and prancing about on shelves and the like.
06-06-2019T21:28:42,AspiringNoodle,"*phew*, that makes much more sense than a dragon-weight kitten"
06-06-2019T21:28:49,Twokinds,Nora can change her weight at will.
06-06-2019T21:28:59,AspiringNoodle,Perk of being a creature of pure magic?
06-06-2019T21:29:11,Sclimshady,but you can never ask her it
06-06-2019T21:29:19,Ordithus,But can her booty keep up with Kaylin :ptv-ohmy:
06-06-2019T21:29:31,Sclimshady,If she wills it
06-06-2019T21:29:32,Dadrobit,":/ it was several years ago, I recall amenon mentioned it on the forums as well. But things change I suppose."
06-06-2019T21:29:52,AspiringNoodle,Gotta be careful with weight stuff and magical shapeshifting.
06-06-2019T21:30:24,InTheLionsDen,She transfers mass to others that ask about her weight.
06-06-2019T21:30:56,thestooge2222,oooh she's in exercise garb! nice!
06-06-2019T21:30:58,NezumiYuki,"That's some lovely shaded booty, Sage!"
06-06-2019T21:31:44,Sclimshady,"Jeez, I just noticed those are 50 kg"
06-06-2019T21:31:57,NezumiYuki,Wait what?  50?!
06-06-2019T21:32:06,AspiringNoodle,Stronk girl
06-06-2019T21:32:08,NezumiYuki,zooms in on Sages window for a sec......
06-06-2019T21:32:12,AspiringNoodle,She should arm wrestle Zarya
06-06-2019T21:32:24,NezumiYuki,Well dang....  100kg total...
06-06-2019T21:32:28,InTheLionsDen,She starts her workout with small weights like these.
06-06-2019T21:32:40,Ordithus,But can she throw a horse and carriage
06-06-2019T21:32:47,steelabjur,It's probably good that Nora can control her weight. Could you imagine how dangerous it would be to share a bed with a several ton dragon?
06-06-2019T21:32:52,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-kingtea:
06-06-2019T21:33:09,AspiringNoodle,I'm pretty sure you'd have to be more worried about what floor you're on.
06-06-2019T21:33:11,NezumiYuki,25 foot... all three tons of her!
06-06-2019T21:33:27,AspiringNoodle,"She'd collapse anything other than ground floor, and that's without a basement."
06-06-2019T21:34:12,AspiringNoodle,It is adorable though.  To see a millieniums old dragon cuddling up with a human like a pet xD
06-06-2019T21:34:34,Ordithus,Pretty sure Trace IS the pet
06-06-2019T21:34:35,steelabjur,"Not that you'd never know though, you'd be squashed into jelly."
06-06-2019T21:34:43,NezumiYuki,smol pet Nora is best pet!
06-06-2019T21:35:34,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"""So you want to make Nora our pet."" Trace ""No, we will be hers."""
06-06-2019T21:36:03,AspiringNoodle,Pocketsize Nora.  Now that would be adorable
06-06-2019T21:36:53,NezumiYuki,"pocket sized and mass, Nora hiding in Trace's shirt pocket, peeking her head out, smiling.    What a cute visual!  xD"
06-06-2019T21:37:54,AspiringNoodle,"Don't forget, Trace would need an annoyed look on his phase, like he's thinking, ""I can't believe I'm indulging her like this..."""
06-06-2019T21:38:01,AspiringNoodle,face*
06-06-2019T21:38:26,AspiringNoodle,"And any templars who look like they're about to question it, he cuts them off with, ""Don't ask..."""
06-06-2019T21:38:35,Mippy,She looks great Sage
06-06-2019T21:38:36,NezumiYuki,XDD
06-06-2019T21:38:50,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-ohmy: Nice sage
06-06-2019T21:38:55,AspiringNoodle,Bonus points if her tail tip is poking above the pocket edge and waggling back and forth
06-06-2019T21:38:59,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nice work sage
06-06-2019T21:39:48,SageSaga,ty

06-06-2019T22:36:32,Masterzooka,Sounds even more like Jesus now
06-06-2019T22:36:32,LannAF,"Well, it's moreso the problem that it opens people up to prodding at you."

06-06-2019T22:36:36,ZRO4825,"Besides, then he'd have to see people arguing over sketches on sundays, and playing ""Hot or not"" with the entire cast, and shit like that. :joy:"
06-06-2019T22:36:43,LannAF,It'd force you to block anyone who isn't your discord friend
06-06-2019T22:36:54,LannAF,Then you'd have everyone trying to add you as a friend and getting notifications
06-06-2019T22:37:15,LannAF,"oof, yeah that's gross to deal with too Zro"
06-06-2019T22:37:23,AFallingTree,i couldn't imagine

06-06-2019T22:37:39,steelabjur,"LOL, he could just look at the official forum or his Patron for that, @LannAF"
06-06-2019T22:37:47,SageSaga,so people cant add me as a friend or prod me
06-06-2019T22:37:59,LannAF,I still do it

06-06-2019T23:05:19,BadFoMo,Why must I sometimes be so sleepy that I leave my /1/ alarm clock on the bed and/or notice the 8:45 PM alarm and /still/ continue sleeping?
06-06-2019T23:05:31,Ordithus,KeiReni... why did I never see it before

06-06-2019T23:41:46,Bgrmystr2,"Yeah, tis how it is when you live in your own world instead of everyone else's reality lol"
06-06-2019T23:42:13,TraceChaos,"I live in the REAL reality, where people know what scantily-clad means, and don't delude themselves"
06-06-2019T23:42:20,Mippy,Arguing over weather Sage’s swimsuits are scanty when Tom is literally colouring FULL ON DRAGON NUDITY!
06-06-2019T23:42:21,EricE549,woah that's some interesting key change
06-06-2019T23:42:26,BadFoMo,How about this; The one with the chat is Tom and the one with the bouncing catgirl/... other girl is Sage.
06-06-2019T23:42:33,Bgrmystr2,"Oh, you mean where everyone is prude? Welcome to 2019, mate."
06-06-2019T23:42:38,Zakuru,"goodnight folks, i can't go on"
06-06-2019T23:42:41,BadFoMo,"...A little late, I know."
06-06-2019T23:42:44,Bgrmystr2,Come out from your 1920s rock.

06-06-2019T23:42:48,TraceChaos,"breh, calling sometheing scanty doesn't make you a prude"
06-06-2019T23:42:56,EricE549,goodnight @Zakuru
06-06-2019T23:43:03,TraceChaos,you can know something is scanty without acting like that's bad
06-06-2019T23:43:08,SageSaga,my girls are wearing swimsuits...
06-06-2019T23:43:12,Sclimshady,night Zak
06-06-2019T23:43:16,FoxxTrotter,"G'night, Zakuru."
06-06-2019T23:43:18,TraceChaos,"swimsuits are scanty, by and large"
06-06-2019T23:43:27,TraceChaos,"that is not bad, nor even lewd"
06-06-2019T23:43:34,Ordithus,Nora over there is wearing nothing at all~ :ctwokinds-NoraEyebrows:
06-06-2019T23:43:42,TraceChaos,but the girls are scantily-clad.
06-06-2019T23:43:46,Sclimshady,:ctwokinds-MikeLewd:
06-06-2019T23:43:51,Bgrmystr2,That's not even what it means xD
06-06-2019T23:43:57,Mippy,Pointed that out earlier Ord
06-06-2019T23:44:52,TraceChaos,"scantily clad, an adjective meaning 'half-clothed'"
06-06-2019T23:44:55,EricE549,goshdang full screen can't exit without safari freezing :T
06-06-2019T23:45:16,Bgrmystr2,"Swimsuits are full clothing. They do not have anything else. By definition, they are not."
06-06-2019T23:45:24,TraceChaos,"it's not necessarily lewd, it's definitely not bad"
06-06-2019T23:45:32,Bgrmystr2,you don't wear anything else with a swimsuit other than the swimsuit.
06-06-2019T23:45:43,TraceChaos,but the girls wearing swim suits (Especially two-pieces) makes them 'scantily clad'.
06-06-2019T23:45:46,Twokinds,Done
06-06-2019T23:45:49,TraceChaos,I don't get why ya'll are throwing a fit over this
