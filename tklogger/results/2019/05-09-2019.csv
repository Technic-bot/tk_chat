05-09-2019T20:33:58,NezumiYuki,"@Kitsunetsuki95 Besides Twokinds and A.I.  what else do you like, Suki?"
05-09-2019T20:34:14,Nekonny,Kemono.cafe
05-09-2019T20:34:21,Nekonny,go read all of those too ^^
05-09-2019T20:34:21,AnuSekaniArt,"I got hooked on TwoKinds, then A.I., then a few others.  Will eventually get to others like Kemono.cafe and Yosh!"
05-09-2019T20:34:24,Kynum,"Ok, so I'm having a hard time understanding Kemono Cafe. I looked at the site and stuff. Is it basically the beginning of a new webcomic collective? Like Keenspot?"
05-09-2019T20:34:47,Nekonny,"Yes, but theres a bit more to it"
05-09-2019T20:34:53,BadFoMo,Back. @SageSaga I think your sneeze /may/ have crashed my computer.
05-09-2019T20:35:18,CrRAR,wb
05-09-2019T20:35:18,Nekonny,"Once I can get that part going, theres supposed to be an area dedicated to interaction between comics"
05-09-2019T20:35:35,Nekonny,through a central hub located around the cafe
05-09-2019T20:35:37,CrRAR,It's like a unsanitary butterfly effect.
05-09-2019T20:35:43,AcePilotIV,now i feel awake
05-09-2019T20:35:56,CrRAR,>Man sneezes
05-09-2019T20:35:58,Kynum,hm
05-09-2019T20:35:58,SageSaga,good Bad- that means my technomancy is starting to finally manifest
05-09-2019T20:36:00,CrRAR,>computer crashes
05-09-2019T20:36:10,Starborn,Hello!
05-09-2019T20:36:15,NezumiYuki,Hiya
05-09-2019T20:36:16,CrRAR,ello!
05-09-2019T20:36:28,IronHorseComics,"see Bad, this is how we make Sage's stream explode"
05-09-2019T20:36:28,SageSaga,soon i will wow you all with comics drawn and animations made through directly connecting my imagination to the digital world
05-09-2019T20:36:39,SpazztasticKiwi,"Sage’s diets so fuckled, his body has developed powers to make up for it"
05-09-2019T20:36:40,CrRAR,brainBLAST
05-09-2019T20:36:42,BadFoMo,Cool!
05-09-2019T20:36:42,RimaDraws,yay
05-09-2019T20:36:46,IronHorseComics,so basically what you already do now...
05-09-2019T20:37:00,AnuSekaniArt,So basically The Matrix but instead of learning Kung Fu you're gonna instantly create art pieces in an instant with the power of your mind? :P
05-09-2019T20:37:01,CrRAR,Hand is the arbitrator
05-09-2019T20:37:03,SageSaga,except much faster
05-09-2019T20:37:10,SpazztasticKiwi,a sneeze can force a computer shut down
05-09-2019T20:37:17,ZRO4825,Hopefully soon we can just do everything in VR o_O
05-09-2019T20:37:26,ZRO4825,"Like...real VR, not the psuedo-VR we have now."
05-09-2019T20:37:27,NezumiYuki,"Well Y'all must excuse me... When the direct brain links to the net begin, I'm gonna be mostly a ""Stand Alone Complex""  :P"
05-09-2019T20:37:41,ZRO4825,Boy the Waifu Wars are gonna get real when that happens...
05-09-2019T20:37:44,SageSaga,"""welcome to my stream- i shall now make so many fully colored images so quickly it will look like its an animation running at 60fps"

05-09-2019T20:37:58,CrimsonHelsing,There's our lovely Roselyn
05-09-2019T20:38:01,AnuSekaniArt,XD
05-09-2019T20:38:09,BadFoMo,I have a sort of story about VR I should get to writing.
05-09-2019T20:38:10,NezumiYuki,Okay well...
05-09-2019T20:38:21,IronHorseComics,"yeah I don't think that would be wise, I've seen 60FPS anime and it's uncanny"
05-09-2019T20:38:50,Kynum,means it hasn't been canned.
05-09-2019T20:38:52,NezumiYuki,"If direct to brain becomes a thing... maybe... just maybe... I'll let myself indulge a bit, and cozy up next to Kathrin for a bit. <3"
05-09-2019T20:38:52,ZRO4825,"It's only uncanny because people keep ""upgrading"" anime to 60fps from like 24."
05-09-2019T20:38:57,AcePilotIV,i use to play games on 3fps and ultra low quality
05-09-2019T20:39:08,AcePilotIV,damn it was fun
05-09-2019T20:39:27,BadFoMo,"Rose: Who's a good girl, Raine?"
05-09-2019T20:39:29,CrRAR,"lol at Red poking back in the room, how many times you think Rose had had to slam the door on him?"
05-09-2019T20:39:33,AcePilotIV,the game crashing every 3 minutes and then having to restart the laptop
05-09-2019T20:39:40,IronHorseComics,Raine: S-shut up!
05-09-2019T20:39:48,IronHorseComics,Raine: It's not funny!
05-09-2019T20:40:00,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Rose ""Now that you have the collar on, go spend some time with that bedridden wolf boy.  He's a good boy and needs some head pats."""
05-09-2019T20:40:03,SageSaga,man people trying to make 60FPS anime by running conversion programs or AI almost always look horrible
05-09-2019T20:40:05,JustSomeFancyPlace,Raine: Damenaaaa!
05-09-2019T20:40:13,CrRAR,haha marv
05-09-2019T20:40:22,ZRO4825,"Amen, Sage."
05-09-2019T20:40:24,JustSomeFancyPlace,that's stawp in nipponese right?
05-09-2019T20:40:26,NezumiYuki,"Rose balances a MilkBone on Raine's muzzle, just behind the nose~   Don't move Raine... Don't drop it! >:3"
05-09-2019T20:40:31,winrock,seeing rose happy is kinda scary xd
05-09-2019T20:40:37,AcePilotIV,na
05-09-2019T20:40:42,RimaDraws,woooow she made her sit
05-09-2019T20:40:43,AcePilotIV,its noice
05-09-2019T20:40:44,Aimbotexe,"Marv I'm sorry to say, that ship is taking on water fast"
05-09-2019T20:40:52,BadFoMo,Red: ...I just got the weirdest boner ever.
05-09-2019T20:40:53,SageSaga,i dont know whats worse- the people praising it thinking it looks good or the people who make it
05-09-2019T20:40:54,JustSomeFancyPlace,also just having the background move at 60fps does the job for anime
05-09-2019T20:40:58,Tharkis,24fps animation works incredibly well because it's a speed that's slow enough to let our mind interpret the 'between' frames
05-09-2019T20:41:07,JustSomeFancyPlace,"leave the caricatures as they are, in grorious 24fps"
05-09-2019T20:41:16,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Then it will adapt, This ship will be a German U boat"
05-09-2019T20:41:18,Tharkis,where 60fps is fast enough you see every frame but you dont fill in the blnaks as it were
05-09-2019T20:41:26,JustSomeFancyPlace,*or 22fps if you're that type*
05-09-2019T20:41:31,IronHorseComics,"I mean, even live action movies moving at higher frame rates looks odd"
05-09-2019T20:41:47,SageSaga,its because you are seeing more detail
05-09-2019T20:41:50,CrRAR,too. much. ACTION.
05-09-2019T20:41:56,Aimbotexe,And just like a u boat it will be sunk by the destroyer known as R&R
05-09-2019T20:41:56,NezumiYuki,That smug grin on Rose tho
05-09-2019T20:42:03,AnuSekaniArt,Yeah I've seen live action films at 60 fps
05-09-2019T20:42:17,IronHorseComics,"indeed, it's just really jarring"
05-09-2019T20:42:17,CrimsonHelsing,"yeah, with games 60 fps is understandable, especially the multiplayer ones. movies/tv shows... looks unusual"
05-09-2019T20:42:19,CrRAR,"""The Raine is mine to COMMAND~"""
05-09-2019T20:42:20,AnuSekaniArt,They look like unedited behind the scenes footage
05-09-2019T20:42:26,JustSomeFancyPlace,60fps is -immersive-
05-09-2019T20:42:32,CrRAR,":ctwokinds-redrose:*[Now, roll over!]"
05-09-2019T20:42:39,AnuSekaniArt,For games yeah
05-09-2019T20:42:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Rose and Raine?  weird but ok
05-09-2019T20:42:51,JustSomeFancyPlace,Rose X Raine new ship
05-09-2019T20:43:13,AnuSekaniArt,Huh
05-09-2019T20:43:16,AnuSekaniArt,Interesting ship XD
05-09-2019T20:43:18,CrimsonHelsing,"she's been alone at that estate for months, and who knows what she'd been through the years prior. so I can see boredom having set in for Rose at this point"
05-09-2019T20:43:29,RimaDraws,this is amusing
05-09-2019T20:43:46,NezumiYuki,"I'm not sure I'm aboard with the whole, Aunt Niece ship thinger...."
05-09-2019T20:43:51,SpazztasticKiwi,my bridesmaids dress arriveth

05-09-2019T22:52:52,CrimsonHelsing,"well, really, the 47 was designed first as an interceptor, but quickly showed its value as a fast attacker"

05-09-2019T22:55:04,IronHorseComics,it can get damaged by pistol bullets
05-09-2019T22:55:05,CrimsonHelsing,"yeah, the design of the Zeke was speed and maneuverability first, survivability second"

05-09-2019T22:57:25,CrRAR,"dang, that Rose... so cunning."
05-09-2019T22:57:28,CrRAR,yis
05-09-2019T22:57:35,InTheLionsDen,But she loves her son.
05-09-2019T22:57:36,IronHorseComics,so devious
05-09-2019T22:57:59,CrimsonHelsing,perhaps she could be getting some ideas on how to make Raine's training more efficient
05-09-2019T22:58:06,IronHorseComics,"anyway, I'm off for bed, I'll see y'all later"

05-09-2019T22:58:41,CrimsonHelsing,"she wants control over her transformation magic quickly, and I'm betting Rose will probably experiment a little to see which method works better"
05-09-2019T22:58:58,InTheLionsDen,Focus Raine's transformation magic on someone else.
05-09-2019T22:59:29,CrimsonHelsing,mayhaps certain lines of thought trigger the right stimuli needed to pull off the spell
05-09-2019T23:00:16,AcePilotIV,ive sent a friend request
05-09-2019T23:00:30,CrimsonHelsing,that's probably Raine's problem: she doesn't have a grasp on the stimuli she needs
05-09-2019T23:00:50,ShamusTheFox,"Well, it's her father's ability. Passed down. So maybe breaking down that emotional barrier?"
05-09-2019T23:01:00,CrimsonHelsing,perhaps
05-09-2019T23:01:06,Kitsunetsuki95,I thought I did
05-09-2019T23:01:24,w0lfmare,She just has to be a manipulative jerk
05-09-2019T23:01:27,w0lfmare,That's the secret
05-09-2019T23:01:40,CrimsonHelsing,I wouldn't word it so harshly per se
05-09-2019T23:01:42,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-karenOOO:
05-09-2019T23:02:00,ShamusTheFox,Speaking of which...maybe Raine isn't limited to wolf keidran Raine. Maybe her perfect transformation will allow her to be whatever she wants to be.
05-09-2019T23:02:22,Ordithus,Like a Basitin!
05-09-2019T23:02:24,A1kash,Какая это страница?
05-09-2019T23:02:37,CrimsonHelsing,"that'd probably be something for Raine to find out later on, when she could try experimenting with spells"
05-09-2019T23:03:23,CrimsonHelsing,"the point of experimenting after all is finding out what you *can* do, and *how* to do it"
05-09-2019T23:03:55,SageSaga,@A1kash it is a new page
05-09-2019T23:04:08,CrimsonHelsing,amirite?
05-09-2019T23:04:22,A1kash,Аа понятно
05-09-2019T23:04:47,ShamusTheFox,"That's something Ive always pondered. If you had the capability to use latent magic, how would you teach others? It's like flexing a muscle you never knew existed; it's really hard to describe to someone so they get it."
05-09-2019T23:04:52,SageSaga,Please try to stick to using English while here
05-09-2019T23:05:28,CrimsonHelsing,"that may very well be the case, Shamus. sometimes you need to run before you can walk"
05-09-2019T23:07:27,ShamusTheFox,"And maybe you just have to find your own way to learn it. Like trying to describe the color green. You might be able to agree what green is, but there's no guarantee you're seeing the same thing."
05-09-2019T23:07:57,CrimsonHelsing,exactly. sometimes it's down to individual perspective
05-09-2019T23:09:27,Nekonny,"ok, time for me to go to bed"
05-09-2019T23:09:33,Nekonny,you guys have a good night!
05-09-2019T23:09:34,A1kash,I just do not know English so well

05-09-2019T23:30:29,SageSaga,i think it was a 15 inch screen size
05-09-2019T23:30:32,Mikemkke034,Plus a full motion dual mount
05-09-2019T23:30:49,CrRAR,also think of the creamy FPS at olny 720p

05-09-2019T23:43:47,ShamusTheFox,It is very strange. Like Dragon Ball Z except more mystical.

05-09-2019T23:44:19,Mikemkke034,Pet speed kitty would be fun. But very danger
05-09-2019T23:44:34,SageSaga,this is the anime

05-09-2019T23:47:09,RimaDraws,?
05-09-2019T23:47:16,Mikemkke034,Lemme check
05-09-2019T23:47:31,SageSaga,it is on Crunchyroll- OMG
05-09-2019T23:47:40,SageSaga,they also have a live action version o_o
05-09-2019T23:47:41,Sclimshady,"If netflix has it, crunchy should too"
05-09-2019T23:47:55,RimaDraws,oh nice
05-09-2019T23:47:56,SageSaga,that's not generally true Sclim
05-09-2019T23:48:07,Sclimshady,"Umm, I already regret the live action and I havent seen it yet"
05-09-2019T23:48:27,SageSaga,im gonna watch it later- gonna add it to my list
05-09-2019T23:48:28,Mikemkke034,"I doubt that it is on there, but I'm checking Hulu"
05-09-2019T23:48:34,Kitsunetsuki95,Well I am learning a lot today
05-09-2019T23:48:38,SageSaga,not all live action japanese stuff is terrible
05-09-2019T23:48:46,SageSaga,especially if it can be done low budget
05-09-2019T23:48:50,Sclimshady,"Hmm,  they really do need to expand the library.  so many I want to watch not on crunchy"
05-09-2019T23:48:51,Mikemkke034,Oh hey Kitsunetsuki
05-09-2019T23:48:52,RimaDraws,yea not all of it
05-09-2019T23:49:04,SageSaga,theres nothing really in Anohana that couldnt be done with live actors
05-09-2019T23:49:17,RimaDraws,funimation and crunchyroll split so thats why there is less now
05-09-2019T23:49:27,SageSaga,Sony's fault
05-09-2019T23:49:32,Mikemkke034,Oof
05-09-2019T23:49:37,RimaDraws,yea sony again
05-09-2019T23:49:51,Sclimshady,"Its always sony, isnt it"
05-09-2019T23:49:55,ShamusTheFox,"Corporations, man."
05-09-2019T23:49:55,RimaDraws,yeap
05-09-2019T23:49:57,SageSaga,nope
05-09-2019T23:49:58,RimaDraws,now spiderman
05-09-2019T23:50:10,SageSaga,Sony did the right thing with Spider-man
05-09-2019T23:50:20,RimaDraws,idk
05-09-2019T23:50:28,RimaDraws,i wont go into it but i am biased
05-09-2019T23:50:29,Sclimshady,Disney was bullying them wasnt it?
05-09-2019T23:50:37,SageSaga,yeah
05-09-2019T23:50:45,AnuSekaniArt,Yeah Disney wanted a larger cut of the film profits in addition to already owning 100% of merchandise sales
05-09-2019T23:50:47,RimaDraws,i heard it was the other way around
05-09-2019T23:50:53,AnuSekaniArt,"Which, for Spider-Man, merch is HUGE"
05-09-2019T23:51:29,SageSaga,Sony is the little guy in the situation and has the rights- and Disney is trying to take that from them-
05-09-2019T23:51:37,AnuSekaniArt,Yeah
05-09-2019T23:51:40,RimaDraws,well disney owns marvel
05-09-2019T23:51:42,Mikemkke034,Whelp...its almost 01:00 for me. I'm probably headed out soon
05-09-2019T23:51:47,RimaDraws,and spider man is marvel
05-09-2019T23:51:49,AnuSekaniArt,Night Mike!
05-09-2019T23:51:51,Ordithus,So weird to think of Sony as the lil guy
05-09-2019T23:51:52,SageSaga,but doesnt own the rights to Spider-man movies
05-09-2019T23:51:55,Mikemkke034,Night Anu
05-09-2019T23:52:13,Sclimshady,Night Mike o/
05-09-2019T23:52:13,ShamusTheFox,I was into the MCU mostly for Iron Man.
05-09-2019T23:52:20,AnuSekaniArt,Yeah Marvel sold off the film rights to Spider-Man when the film studio was nearly bankrupt in the 90s
05-09-2019T23:52:23,RimaDraws,iron man <3
05-09-2019T23:52:24,Mikemkke034,Cheers Sclim

05-09-2019T23:52:37,ShamusTheFox,Laters!
05-09-2019T23:52:38,SageSaga,if you sold your rights away you cant just get them back for nothing
05-09-2019T23:52:54,A1kash,"you will probably be surprised, but even though I am Russian, it’s still not easy for me to write in Russian"
05-09-2019T23:53:01,Sclimshady,If you could... infinite money
05-09-2019T23:53:47,SageSaga,XD
