19-06-2019T01:08:47,Twokinds,Help
19-06-2019T01:09:36,iliar,what's happened?
19-06-2019T01:09:39,Twokinds,What do I call Adira's chest to shoulder fur
19-06-2019T01:11:32,iliar,Oh.  We have a word for this.  But I have no idea how to translate it.
19-06-2019T01:15:12,iliar,"Technically, it translates as “dickey”. ”But I think it will not work."
19-06-2019T01:31:56,AspiringNoodle,Mane?
19-06-2019T01:39:48,Twokinds,I was thinking either mane or fur collar
19-06-2019T01:43:02,Dadrobit,"The chest fur specifically I'd go for mane, the shoulders might be classified as tufts."
19-06-2019T01:43:22,iliar,Fur collar sounds good for my taste
19-06-2019T01:43:33,AspiringNoodle,We could always call it floof and call it a day :P
19-06-2019T01:44:51,Dadrobit,Fur collar sound like something someone would call a mane when English isn't their primary language and they forgot the word lol.
19-06-2019T01:44:59,Dadrobit,Sounds*
19-06-2019T01:50:01,AspiringNoodle,*just learned buffalo wings are keto friendly*
19-06-2019T01:50:09,AspiringNoodle,...Must try Keto
19-06-2019T01:55:26,Dadrobit,So long as they're not breaded or glazed with something high in glucose.
19-06-2019T01:59:33,AspiringNoodle,"Nah, I like them good ol' sauces that are traditional, or use even more fat xD"
19-06-2019T02:02:20,Dadrobit,"I mean, honey BBQ is a pretty traditional wing sauce that isn't keto friendly at all lol."
19-06-2019T02:02:26,AspiringNoodle,"There's a sportsbar near my house that has some sauces that are nothing more than hotsauce mixed with dressings.  My favorites are the one mixed with blue cheese dressing, and I'm not sure what the other one is.  Maybe mayo?"
19-06-2019T02:03:16,AspiringNoodle,I guess the only downside to the keto diet is that I wouldn't be able to get the bed of fries underneath to soak up extra sauce
19-06-2019T02:10:31,SpazztasticKiwi,“tippet” is the term for fur that hangs around the shoulder to near chest
19-06-2019T02:10:51,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s also most commonly used as a reference to a “fur boa”
19-06-2019T02:11:08,AspiringNoodle,^ just confirmed
19-06-2019T02:11:10,SpazztasticKiwi,primarily worn by women
19-06-2019T02:11:18,AspiringNoodle,"All hail Kiwi, savior of Tom's sanity!"
19-06-2019T02:15:03,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s technically a fashion term considering it’s referencing an item of fashio
19-06-2019T02:15:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Whether it works for Tom or he uses it is up to him. It’s just what I know
19-06-2019T02:16:02,AspiringNoodle,"Tbh, we owe him after all the reference sheets that are being voted for xD"
19-06-2019T02:17:29,AspiringNoodle,I think I'm gonna call it a night before I try to pull another unsuccessful all night.  Sweet dreams everyone.
19-06-2019T02:17:36,AspiringNoodle,Peace! :ptv-sleepy:

19-06-2019T14:19:36,Dadrobit,"My mouse needs to be replaced rather desperately. Middle mouse button stopped working ages ago, and now my left click is doulbe clicking all the time."
19-06-2019T14:20:29,Dadrobit,"It's actually tragic, I've had this thing for almost a decade now..."
19-06-2019T15:22:04,AspiringNoodle,I know the feeling :(
19-06-2019T15:23:22,AspiringNoodle,My last mouse started double clicking the right click before anything else remotely went bad
19-06-2019T15:27:51,Dadrobit,"I mean, mine's nothing special. It's literally just the mouse that comes out of the box when you buy a computer from like WalMart"
19-06-2019T15:28:24,Dadrobit,"So it's not like it's a huge loss or anything, just annoying that I have to replace it at all."
19-06-2019T15:28:49,Dadrobit,"Props to HP though I suppose. Free mouse, lasted 10 years of daily use."
19-06-2019T15:30:30,AspiringNoodle,Mine didn't last nearly as long.  Only 4 or so.  Jealoooooouuuuuuuus
19-06-2019T15:30:42,AspiringNoodle,"But hey, I'm using the same keyboard from 2006 :D"
19-06-2019T15:30:52,AspiringNoodle,Good ol' Dell <3
19-06-2019T15:34:12,Dadrobit,Honestly I think I might just take it apart and clean off the contacts and see if that fixes it. Maybe take a stab at looking at what's up with the middle mouse button as well.
19-06-2019T15:34:36,Dadrobit,"Scoll wheel still works, just not the button press. Legit might just be a dirty contact."
19-06-2019T15:36:14,AspiringNoodle,"I think at 10 years old, it would be easier and less time consuming to just buy a replacement mouse :ptv-laugh:"
19-06-2019T15:36:59,AspiringNoodle,Consider it lasting so long with so little problems a blessing :P
19-06-2019T16:12:54,Dadrobit,Boom. Fixed! https://i.imgur.com/pFCvIw4.jpg <The internals for the curious.
19-06-2019T16:13:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I want to know what they’re putting in Hollywood’s water
19-06-2019T16:14:12,SpazztasticKiwi,ew mouse guts
19-06-2019T16:14:19,SpazztasticKiwi,that’s nsfw
19-06-2019T16:14:19,Dadrobit,"Gave the board an initial alcohol wiping, but because the buttons had no visible contacts without having to go through a soldering mess, I instead gave it an alcohol bath before blasting the buttons with compressed air."
19-06-2019T16:14:43,Dadrobit,Even got my middle mouse button back.
19-06-2019T16:15:00,Dadrobit,Though it's not 100%
19-06-2019T16:15:13,Dadrobit,I'm finding it takes an extra click sometimes.
19-06-2019T16:15:27,AspiringNoodle,"If the mouse dies dies in a month, I will bust a gut xD"
19-06-2019T16:15:55,SpazztasticKiwi,tis an old mouse - it’s yearning for retirement and the visit of its grandchildren
19-06-2019T16:16:34,Dadrobit,A quick test. 3 out of 50 clicks were unresponsive on M3.
19-06-2019T16:16:47,Dadrobit,Better than 50/50 though.
19-06-2019T16:17:30,Dadrobit,Screw going out and buying a new mouse when a little maintenance just fixes it yo.
19-06-2019T16:17:44,SpazztasticKiwi,clickclickclickclickclick *pop up* “congratulations - 50 random clicks has fixed the problem”
19-06-2019T16:18:13,SpazztasticKiwi,I need to get my laptop keyboard looked at
19-06-2019T16:18:26,Dadrobit,I've had mice that cost legit dosh full on die on me while this little monster of a mouse just keeps trucking.
19-06-2019T16:19:33,SpazztasticKiwi,All the problem is that it’s seems to taken a desire to try escaping from the laptop itself
19-06-2019T16:19:53,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s been months and I’ve yet to go get someone to pop it back
19-06-2019T16:22:57,SpazztasticKiwi,and there were many tiny birbs at the park
19-06-2019T16:32:51,AspiringNoodle,"My first mouse was a Razer Naga, and that was perfect for playing WoW"
19-06-2019T16:33:23,AspiringNoodle,"While I probably could have fixed it, I'm more than happy to have ""upgraded"" to a Logitech G502.  Much more useful for shooters, and has just enough buttons to be great for RPGs <3"

19-06-2019T17:05:53,AspiringNoodle,"From a looks standpoint, homestyle has a yellow hue while vanilla bean is more of an eggshell white with little black specks :P"
19-06-2019T17:08:07,SpazztasticKiwi,there’s a shampoo here called “miracle moist”
