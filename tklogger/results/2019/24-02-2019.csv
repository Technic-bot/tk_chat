24-02-2019T00:27:36,Dadrobit,"Yeah, but you've seen me on PC. It's not a good time."
24-02-2019T00:31:18,RimaDraws,Oh boy neighbors are playing something up there again
24-02-2019T00:31:24,RimaDraws,And I gotta sleep tonight
24-02-2019T00:36:41,unsteddyphoenix,Youre a god tbh
24-02-2019T00:55:32,Dadrobit,Caustic is actually just cursed. Not gonna lie.

24-02-2019T01:10:39,Twokinds,True would have had plenty of time to eat
24-02-2019T01:13:03,unsteddyphoenix,I made sure of it :sunglasses:
24-02-2019T01:14:42,unsteddyphoenix,(because I died a lot)
24-02-2019T01:15:42,Dadrobit,Speaking of dying a lot https://i.imgur.com/2HQVd9P.jpg
24-02-2019T01:15:48,Dadrobit,I just can't do it.
24-02-2019T01:16:34,Dadrobit,Every damn time
24-02-2019T01:19:47,THETOXICATOR,Yeet
24-02-2019T01:19:55,THETOXICATOR,Good morning!
24-02-2019T01:40:19,unsteddyphoenix,Winning is overrated anyway
24-02-2019T01:40:44,unsteddyphoenix,Its about the journey and friendship
24-02-2019T01:40:51,unsteddyphoenix,Which is why you shouLD SWITCH BACK TO PC
24-02-2019T01:53:53,Dadrobit,You realize I have friends on PS4 right?
24-02-2019T01:54:04,Dadrobit,"Like, an overwhelming majority is there."
24-02-2019T01:54:07,unsteddyphoenix,Are any of them me?
24-02-2019T01:54:42,Dadrobit,"Plus it's fun to fuck with people using my ""grinding stone voice"" to throw out my own Caustic lines in chat."
24-02-2019T01:55:08,Dadrobit,"They could be you if you loved me enough, unsteddy."
24-02-2019T01:55:51,unsteddyphoenix,Lmao
24-02-2019T01:55:55,unsteddyphoenix,That does sound pretty good
24-02-2019T01:58:04,Dadrobit,"Alas, my teammates are all boosted, so rare is the time that I get to the final squad(s) with any of them actually alive with me. 3v1 is just not a fun time using a slow bulky character."
24-02-2019T02:01:37,unsteddyphoenix,Me boosted too :D
24-02-2019T02:17:07,Dadrobit,At least you don't intentionally run into the death ring to die?
24-02-2019T02:24:00,unsteddyphoenix,Ehh
24-02-2019T02:24:04,unsteddyphoenix,Not INTENTIONALLY

24-02-2019T18:13:43,TerraTheWizard,hi dadro
24-02-2019T18:13:55,Dadrobit,Just got back from an interview. Feeling moderately hopeful.
24-02-2019T18:14:13,ThingsAreMoving,o/ Dad
24-02-2019T18:14:55,ThingsAreMoving,"I got an email from my recruiter, they hired someone else, lol."

24-02-2019T18:18:19,ThingsAreMoving,else even
24-02-2019T18:18:32,Bgrmystr2,awwwww things noo
24-02-2019T18:20:43,ThingsAreMoving,"I think they couldn't wait much longer, cause the recruiter let me know that the feedback was great, but they took someone local."
24-02-2019T18:21:22,ThingsAreMoving,"welp, gonna probably go for a vacation for a week or three and then carry on with job huntings"
24-02-2019T18:21:52,Bgrmystr2,god speed dude
24-02-2019T18:23:53,Bgrmystr2,"you're a good man things, I hope you get somethin good soon"
24-02-2019T18:27:34,ThingsAreMoving,"Not gonna rush it, I have enough savings to not work for a year and still be able to dish out that 10$ on patreon."

24-02-2019T18:36:15,ThingsAreMoving,Hoping to celebrate Dadro's successful job hunt first.
24-02-2019T18:36:39,ThingsAreMoving,"Any indication when they'll let you know what's what, Dad?"
24-02-2019T18:50:24,Dadrobit,"They said they're conducting interviews through the week, so no update until at least after that."
24-02-2019T18:51:14,Dadrobit,"I also stopped by my old college professors classes since I'm heading back for my associates, chatted them up for a bit."
24-02-2019T18:52:06,Dadrobit,"Told me to come back to them after I graduate for a job as a TA or possibly full instructor in sound design, so that's another opportunity at some point."
24-02-2019T18:53:15,ThingsAreMoving,"All you need is some job experience, and boom, you'll have so many opportunities you won't know which one to pick"
24-02-2019T18:53:50,Dadrobit,"I don't think I'd mind being a professor for those classes, I very thoroughly enjoyed taking them. And damn near everyone else in my family is a teacher as well anyways lol."
24-02-2019T18:55:43,Dadrobit,One of my professors doesn't even have a degree himself. Just boatloads of experience.
24-02-2019T19:01:24,ThingsAreMoving,In my country I'd need to have a higher education to do the same kind of work I'm doing in the UK. Experience + common sense are sometimes more valuable than raw knowledge.
24-02-2019T19:02:06,ThingsAreMoving,depends on the field though. I suspect sound engineering requires truckload of knowledge to get started
24-02-2019T19:04:51,Dadrobit,"Ehhhhh~There is certainly a truckload of knowledge that helps to get into the field, but you could probably get by with a midsized sedan."
24-02-2019T19:08:50,ThingsAreMoving,:blue_car:
24-02-2019T19:11:42,Dadrobit,It's easy to get the knowledge. Anyone can spend an afternoon learning how to wrap a cable or set up a compressor. The big bucks go to the people that know how to interface with other people.
24-02-2019T19:13:38,ThingsAreMoving,I lack in interpersonal department. Machines are easier to understand than humans
24-02-2019T19:15:06,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno about that one. At least humans can tell you what they think is wrong. computers just.. fuck that, you get nothing good day sir."
24-02-2019T19:15:12,Bgrmystr2,Dx
24-02-2019T19:16:09,Combak,"So, what's going on folks?"
24-02-2019T19:16:14,ThingsAreMoving,"Humans can deceive or manipulate you for their own gains, machines are still logical."
24-02-2019T19:16:19,Combak,I'm heading to bed within the hour.
24-02-2019T19:16:39,ThingsAreMoving,You want a quick recap?
24-02-2019T19:16:44,Combak,Sure?
24-02-2019T19:16:55,Bgrmystr2,"perhaps, things."
24-02-2019T19:17:17,ThingsAreMoving,"Tom's exhausted, dadrobit had a job interview, I got a confirmation I didn't land a job where I was hoping to."
24-02-2019T19:18:05,Combak,"Ah, okay then!"
24-02-2019T19:18:49,Combak,Sorry to hear that.
24-02-2019T19:18:58,ThingsAreMoving,"I mean that from my point of view, ofc, Bgr."
24-02-2019T19:19:22,ThingsAreMoving,"there are people who can easily deal, connect and relate with any other human being"
24-02-2019T19:19:38,ThingsAreMoving,I'm not one of them unfortunately.

24-02-2019T21:15:34,Ordithus,Exhausted from today.  Felt like a whole week
24-02-2019T21:17:16,Mippy,I already like Photoshop more than Illustrator
24-02-2019T21:26:20,CrRAR,"Yeah, PS is more... raw. Less hand-holdy."
24-02-2019T21:27:04,CrRAR,Mainly because Illustrator is heavily intended for creating more vector art.
24-02-2019T21:27:36,CrRAR,it's not as... organic.
24-02-2019T21:34:04,Mippy,Illustrator frustrates me so much. XD I guess I’m not a fan of vectors.
24-02-2019T21:36:22,CrRAR,It's better for graphic design where everything is more clinical and exact.
24-02-2019T21:36:31,CrRAR,PS much better for ART. xD
24-02-2019T21:37:03,RimaDraws,yea i got majority of spanish homework done tonight. so just a couple more things to do and i can be done with that for a week.
24-02-2019T21:37:27,CrRAR,huzzah!
24-02-2019T21:38:55,RimaDraws,yea so far so good and its only monday
24-02-2019T21:40:34,CrRAR,"Yeahhhh, the wheels fall off the week by Thursday and after that ya just improvise till the weekend. It's just prophesy."
24-02-2019T21:41:04,RimaDraws,well i have the weekends off. and my week usually goes pretty smooth
24-02-2019T21:41:40,CrRAR,"exactlyyy, weekends are the resets."
24-02-2019T21:42:58,RimaDraws,well like i said my week goes pretty smooth
24-02-2019T21:43:08,RimaDraws,my weekend wasnt exactly a reset this week because of the flooding.
24-02-2019T21:43:19,CrRAR,tru
24-02-2019T21:45:27,Ordithus,I need a break from work...
