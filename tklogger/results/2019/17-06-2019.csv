17-06-2019T02:07:00,AspiringNoodle,"Dammit Photo, I wanted to give you a chance :("
17-06-2019T02:10:05,AspiringNoodle,Found the ability to use tilt for brushes.  But it's so limited.
17-06-2019T02:10:46,AspiringNoodle,"That, or there's some complicated way to get what I want :/"
17-06-2019T02:11:50,AspiringNoodle,"As far as I can tell, you can have things like size / flow / opacity be affected by pressure or tilt, but not both at the same time."

17-06-2019T02:25:48,Bgrmystr2,"Well*, cuz fuck keyboards too."

17-06-2019T15:08:40,AspiringNoodle,$5 or whatever their currency is that they're going to see an EXTREMELY age inappropriate film
17-06-2019T15:09:40,AspiringNoodle,"And I mean the kind that'll have them running out of the theater in two halves, just so the guy who sold them the ticket can still be like, ""...Whatever..."""
17-06-2019T15:23:46,AspiringNoodle,"Also, yesterday I mentioned how upset I'd be if I woke up at 1 today"
17-06-2019T15:24:03,AspiringNoodle,"Woke up at 3.  Don't know whether to be angry, upset, or laugh at the situation."
17-06-2019T15:42:07,Xexanoth,...
17-06-2019T15:42:15,Xexanoth,have you tried going to bed earlier?
17-06-2019T15:43:42,AspiringNoodle,Yes :D
17-06-2019T15:44:32,AspiringNoodle,"I'm gonna try going to bed at 2 tonight.  If I wake up at 5 tomorrow, I may just bust a gut laughing."
17-06-2019T17:07:56,SpazztasticKiwi,"goin through old swim stuff, I pulled out an old one piece. Bagheera: ‚ÄúSTRIIIIINGS!‚Äù"
17-06-2019T17:21:45,TeapotOfDoom,I suppose that's more interesting then data sheets
17-06-2019T17:22:12,TeapotOfDoom,Good old insomniac me is reading one. Quality literature

17-06-2019T19:31:51,SpazztasticKiwi,no mayo for my sandwich
17-06-2019T19:31:56,SpazztasticKiwi,the end is nigh
17-06-2019T19:39:24,AspiringNoodle,Any gamers in the room?
17-06-2019T19:39:34,Bgrmystr2,"I'd give some, but internet"
17-06-2019T19:42:32,SpazztasticKiwi,just some mustard will do
17-06-2019T19:42:46,Bgrmystr2,ew no pls
17-06-2019T19:42:54,SpazztasticKiwi,besides I try to cut most mayo and stuff
17-06-2019T19:43:11,SpazztasticKiwi,gotta get swimsuit ready
17-06-2019T20:13:24,Dadrobit,No yellow mustard at least. Some darker spicier mustards are pretty excellent for some application.
17-06-2019T20:14:25,Bgrmystr2,all mustard is a pass imo
17-06-2019T21:02:05,SpazztasticKiwi,yes mustard
17-06-2019T21:02:09,SpazztasticKiwi,all the mustard
17-06-2019T21:02:16,SpazztasticKiwi,must have mustard
17-06-2019T21:02:43,SpazztasticKiwi,you‚Äôre just cowards
17-06-2019T21:03:46,Dadrobit,"I am no coward, I just have refined tastes!"
17-06-2019T21:12:54,SonOfGoku,All hail the mustard
17-06-2019T21:14:33,Bgrmystr2,"I've tasted mustard, it's terrible."
17-06-2019T21:14:45,SpazztasticKiwi,CoWaRdS
17-06-2019T21:14:59,Dadrobit,I actually haven't made mustard in a while. I should stop by the store in the morning and get some mustard stuffs.
17-06-2019T21:15:16,Bgrmystr2,That would only be true if I was afraid to taste it. Which isn't the case. So.. your statement is invalid kiwi xD
17-06-2019T21:16:00,SpazztasticKiwi,speaking of stores did you two see the day I had to write a certain thing on a cheesecake at work?
17-06-2019T21:16:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Lady came up and asked my to write ‚Äúhappy birthday Big Daddy‚Äù
17-06-2019T21:16:50,Dadrobit,I think I remember something to that effect?
17-06-2019T21:17:13,SpazztasticKiwi,as the official cake decorator told me ‚Äúyou attract all the nuts‚Äù
17-06-2019T21:17:20,SpazztasticKiwi,and honestly I agree
17-06-2019T21:17:57,SpazztasticKiwi,not the most disturbing thing I‚Äôve witnessed though
17-06-2019T21:19:44,Dadrobit,Retail I found is just the process of customers slowly one-upping themselves on how much they can shock and appall you until you lose all sense of humanity.
17-06-2019T21:20:23,Dadrobit,S'why I'm as nice and accommodating to everyone I meet in the business nowadays.
17-06-2019T21:22:14,SpazztasticKiwi,the one thing I‚Äôve yet to see is blatant streaking
17-06-2019T21:22:53,Dadrobit,I've seen a bit of nakedness from folks that just stopped giving a damn.
17-06-2019T21:23:25,SpazztasticKiwi,"‚ÄúYou seen one, you‚Äôve seen them all #notmyjob‚Äù"
17-06-2019T21:23:42,Dadrobit,"Also, I don't get folks that use all anime screenshots as their Tinder pics. Like, come on."
17-06-2019T21:23:55,Dadrobit,Immediate swipe left
17-06-2019T21:23:59,SpazztasticKiwi,had any luck?
17-06-2019T21:27:06,Dadrobit,"Nah, aside from the one lady who ghosted me at the movies a while back after I made a comment about liking short hair."
17-06-2019T21:27:19,SpazztasticKiwi,aw
17-06-2019T21:27:27,SpazztasticKiwi,well time is key
17-06-2019T21:27:48,Dadrobit,"Hmmmmm ""1929 miles away"""
17-06-2019T21:28:08,Dadrobit,I'm thinking a long distance relationship is not in my immediate future.
17-06-2019T21:28:10,SpazztasticKiwi,I had a talk with someone I knew in hs. He wanted to see about a reunion after these few years
17-06-2019T21:28:37,SpazztasticKiwi,I mentioned a possibility date and time and poof
17-06-2019T21:29:15,SpazztasticKiwi,so out the window I guess
17-06-2019T21:29:41,Dadrobit,Defenestration is the word you're looking for.
17-06-2019T21:30:13,SpazztasticKiwi,means I‚Äôm back to open for ‚Äúcoffee?‚Äù and such
17-06-2019T21:30:24,Dadrobit,"Anywho, I gotta get ready for work. Might pop on later if/when I get bored."
17-06-2019T21:30:38,Dadrobit,o/
17-06-2019T21:30:54,Ordithus,hibye robit
17-06-2019T21:31:10,SpazztasticKiwi,though I will admit I‚Äôve never actually been asked on dates - it‚Äôs more talk here and there until it becomes habit and then dating
17-06-2019T21:31:11,Ordithus,:cw0lfmare-Florascience:*[woo science]
17-06-2019T21:31:45,SpazztasticKiwi,don‚Äôt let the trespassing teens bite!

17-06-2019T21:50:57,SpazztasticKiwi,I browse fb and internet for inside joke I laugh to myself about later
17-06-2019T21:51:06,SpazztasticKiwi,because most everyone else don‚Äôt get it
17-06-2019T22:04:25,SpazztasticKiwi,what couples are there established in TK
17-06-2019T22:04:45,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-traceflohug::ctwokinds-natkeith:
17-06-2019T22:05:07,Ordithus,Raine and Red seem to be getting quite serious
17-06-2019T22:06:13,metalman20,and it even looks like maren and sythe are starting to become a thing. maybe
17-06-2019T22:06:28,metalman20,though i might just be reaching with that one
17-06-2019T22:07:56,Dadrobit,Laura X Urn

17-06-2019T22:09:03,Bgrmystr2,there's been more than enough time since then
17-06-2019T22:09:07,Bgrmystr2,also we make this joke all the time
17-06-2019T22:09:11,Bgrmystr2,you're just late :)
17-06-2019T22:09:12,Ordithus,It's only been like... 3 weeks in the comic
17-06-2019T22:09:49,metalman20,well it has only been a month since i've joined the community so you're right about that bgr lol
17-06-2019T22:09:50,Bgrmystr2,xD
17-06-2019T22:10:03,Dadrobit,Probably closer to a month-month and a half now.
17-06-2019T22:10:11,SpazztasticKiwi,cause I could see either Flora or Nat goosing Trace or Keith for a sketch
17-06-2019T22:10:18,Ordithus,hm I think you're right robit
17-06-2019T22:10:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Or maybe Red does it to Raine and to spooks her back into full human form
17-06-2019T22:10:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Only for Maren to slap him
17-06-2019T22:10:53,Dadrobit,"Anyways, I'm outta here o/"

17-06-2019T22:37:16,AspiringNoodle,Reminds me of the time Deadpool made a joke
17-06-2019T22:38:07,metalman20,have a great night everyone
17-06-2019T22:38:21,AspiringNoodle,"""Hmmm.  These streets are deader than Gwen Stacy."""
17-06-2019T23:31:00,SpazztasticKiwi,fluffy hair is best hair - I have an idea for Flora fluffs the Trace floof
