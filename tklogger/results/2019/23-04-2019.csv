23-04-2019T15:49:50,BadFoMo,"Sorry, I had to ask."
23-04-2019T16:41:41,Bgrmystr2,So.. was the removal of Raine's ears in the current comic page intentional?
23-04-2019T16:43:38,Bgrmystr2,"cuz she still had ears in the previous page. I would have presumed that if she wasn't going to have them, it would have been due to her having the confidence that red gave her."
23-04-2019T16:43:52,Bgrmystr2,"solidified her feelings at least a little bit, but she still had the ears then too"
23-04-2019T17:10:55,Twokinds,It's just an error
23-04-2019T17:11:09,Twokinds,And yours was the in the last round bad
23-04-2019T17:11:34,Bgrmystr2,ah okay.
23-04-2019T17:33:07,Twokinds,"Er I mean they changed back, spontaniously between pages. Yes. That's it."

23-04-2019T21:18:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Hilarious
23-04-2019T21:19:29,SpazztasticKiwi,By the way I met Buff Grandpa at work today
23-04-2019T21:27:16,Twokinds,oh?
23-04-2019T21:45:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Came up to the deli looking for cocktail sauce
23-04-2019T21:46:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Voice didn‚Äôt exactly match what I turned around to
23-04-2019T21:46:45,SpazztasticKiwi,But it‚Äôs not the weirdest thing I‚Äôve seen
23-04-2019T22:28:10,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also, I found this monstrosity on lunch https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/524825976597643265/570813131895603221/image0.jpg"
23-04-2019T22:28:46,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-confused: ...what. What is that?
23-04-2019T22:29:15,Bgrmystr2,looks like some 4th dimension children's slide
23-04-2019T22:29:53,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs a high heel
23-04-2019T22:29:59,SpazztasticKiwi,But wait. It gets worse
23-04-2019T22:30:02,SpazztasticKiwi,https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/524825976597643265/570813131895603220/image1.jpg
23-04-2019T22:31:03,Bgrmystr2,no actually that one looks like a heel. it also looks like it would absolutely destroy your foot and ankle muscles
23-04-2019T22:32:14,SpazztasticKiwi,"That‚Äôs all high heels. But with the first one, there‚Äôs a stand for your heel and a stand for the tip of your foot. No arch"
23-04-2019T22:32:48,SpazztasticKiwi,The second is a kind of heel I‚Äôve tried. It puts all your weight and balance on the tip of your feet at all times
23-04-2019T22:33:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Sure you can sit back and there‚Äôs balance and weight to the heel. But all the focus is on the end
23-04-2019T22:34:09,Bgrmystr2,yeah we're not designed to walk like that
23-04-2019T22:34:28,Bgrmystr2,"there's a reason our feet are flat to the ground, unlike animals."
23-04-2019T22:34:53,SpazztasticKiwi,But it‚Äôs sexy
23-04-2019T22:35:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Due note the pure sarcasm
23-04-2019T22:35:55,SpazztasticKiwi,That second style can also be used to make animal feet boots or make it seem like you have hooves/paws
23-04-2019T22:36:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Useful if someone tried cosplaying Flora or such
23-04-2019T22:37:33,Bgrmystr2,"some people would not use sarcasm. I am not one of those people, nor do I understand them."
23-04-2019T22:38:00,Bgrmystr2,but yeah I'm sure you could easily get a better shoe than a high heel like that
23-04-2019T22:39:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Not the kind to buy that mess. I have one pair of heels and I basically never wear them
23-04-2019T22:40:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Random stuff pops onto my feed sometimes. They‚Äôre considered an art more than for wearing so they appeared I guess
23-04-2019T22:51:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh yeah and it was Thomas Sanders birthday
23-04-2019T22:57:07,SpazztasticKiwi,what. https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/524825976597643265/570820473567445002/image0.jpg

23-04-2019T22:58:56,SpazztasticKiwi,That one looks like an overwatch weapon
23-04-2019T22:59:01,Dadrobit,I could see that spikey one at one of the Mad Max conventions I go to.
23-04-2019T22:59:10,Bgrmystr2,5/7 shoes that noone would ever wear because it's impossible to stand up
23-04-2019T22:59:58,SpazztasticKiwi,How is this chick even standing? https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/524825976597643265/570821188394418182/image0.jpg
23-04-2019T23:00:22,Bgrmystr2,is she standing? Can't prove it
23-04-2019T23:00:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt always roll a joint but when I do it‚Äôs my ankle
23-04-2019T23:00:35,Bgrmystr2,could be sitting down on somethin with shoe on the floor
23-04-2019T23:02:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Ok these I like https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/524825976597643265/570821825647607808/image0.jpg
23-04-2019T23:03:52,Bgrmystr2,that just looks tacky
23-04-2019T23:04:33,Dadrobit,My pops could make that for ya
23-04-2019T23:06:27,Dadrobit,Makin' stuff out of rusty chains and the like is kinda his thing.

23-04-2019T23:06:37,SpazztasticKiwi,More of a Halloween base
23-04-2019T23:07:01,SpazztasticKiwi,If you wanted to go for a haunted chained ghost thing
23-04-2019T23:07:15,Bgrmystr2,"as long he doesn't make that fuckin scorpion thing from that transformers movie, we're good. Bad movie or not, that thing was terrifying."
23-04-2019T23:07:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Meanwhile this is the hoof/paw like shoe I was talking about https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/524825976597643265/570821825647607808/image0.jpg
23-04-2019T23:08:09,Bgrmystr2,uh...
23-04-2019T23:08:18,Bgrmystr2,that's the chain link shoe.
23-04-2019T23:08:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Of course
23-04-2019T23:08:41,SpazztasticKiwi,https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/524825976597643265/570822089901080576/image0.jpg
23-04-2019T23:09:00,SpazztasticKiwi,different color and pattern but that‚Äôs how they sit
23-04-2019T23:09:04,SpazztasticKiwi,generally
23-04-2019T23:09:21,Bgrmystr2,"oookay, that's kinda cool"
23-04-2019T23:09:38,Bgrmystr2,guessing that front part sticking out is the toe
23-04-2019T23:09:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Try balancing in them
23-04-2019T23:09:49,Bgrmystr2,cuz yer leg isn't gonna bend backwards like that
23-04-2019T23:09:53,Bgrmystr2,unless you break it
23-04-2019T23:09:57,SpazztasticKiwi,No actually she‚Äôs facing the sidewalk
23-04-2019T23:10:29,SpazztasticKiwi,The point poking out as a sort of triangle shape is her heel
23-04-2019T23:11:12,Bgrmystr2,"if that's her heel then she's actually facing the street to the left, not the sidewalk XD"
23-04-2019T23:11:30,SpazztasticKiwi,tomato tomahto
23-04-2019T23:11:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I just know I‚Äôve tried that design
23-04-2019T23:12:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Not terribly fun. Never forget you can‚Äôt rock back on your heels
23-04-2019T23:34:23,Dadrobit,4/24 Never Forget
23-04-2019T23:35:16,Twokinds,Man April went by fast
23-04-2019T23:35:59,Twokinds,I swear it just went in the blink of an eye.
23-04-2019T23:36:01,Dadrobit,"I still see videos on Youtube that were posted in 2018 and think, ""Oh, this is super recent then! Wait...."""
23-04-2019T23:36:41,Twokinds,I know! 2019 is 1/3 over. That's insane!
23-04-2019T23:36:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Doesn‚Äôt time go faster the older you are
23-04-2019T23:37:31,Twokinds,Well pretty soon it's gunna be 2100 at this rate.
23-04-2019T23:38:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Chill. It‚Äôs already just 6 months until I‚Äôm 23. It‚Äôs terrible
23-04-2019T23:38:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Don‚Äôt rush
23-04-2019T23:40:41,Twokinds,Well that means in 2100 you'll turn 104.
23-04-2019T23:41:35,Twokinds,I'll be 113
23-04-2019T23:41:54,Twokinds,I want to see the year 2222.
23-04-2019T23:42:08,Twokinds,So I only have to live to be 235. Doesn't seem too hard.
23-04-2019T23:43:51,Dadrobit,"No joke, 2100 is a goal. It seems like such a ""futuristic"" age to live in."
23-04-2019T23:44:37,Dadrobit,"Holding out on some hella good medical progress to make it that far, but a guy can dream."
23-04-2019T23:46:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Be stubborn
