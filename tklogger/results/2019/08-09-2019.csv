08-09-2019T05:33:30,Twokinds,Ah thanks!
08-09-2019T06:57:44,WINDOWS98SE,This Friday will be the longest we've ever went without Laura being posted on Patreon.
08-09-2019T06:58:17,WINDOWS98SE,"Second longest was between Jan 8, 2018 and May 5, 2018."

08-09-2019T07:25:46,TerraTheWizard,"ohi tom, didn't expect to see you here this early"
08-09-2019T09:32:24,SpazztasticKiwi,why on earth are you up this early
08-09-2019T12:15:19,RimaDraws,Hey
08-09-2019T12:36:44,CrimsonQuill,Good evening.
08-09-2019T12:36:54,AspiringNoodle,So apparently we need a laura suggestion this week :p
08-09-2019T12:37:15,AspiringNoodle,"Also joy.  8 hour shift tonight out of the blue because ""making up hours"" :ptv-unimpressed:"
08-09-2019T12:37:16,CrimsonQuill,Urgh
08-09-2019T12:37:31,CrimsonQuill,I felt wrecked after watching the entire stream last night
08-09-2019T12:37:38,CrimsonQuill,And today was...weird.
08-09-2019T12:53:18,Twokinds,"I had a dentist appointment this morning, that's why I was awake so early."
08-09-2019T12:53:24,WINDOWS98SE,"@AspiringNoodle There's usually a couple of Laura suggestions in the polls each week, but they're never voted on and Tom never picks them."
08-09-2019T12:53:34,WINDOWS98SE,"The new system is completely stacked against Laura; she's never going to get drawn again, and that breaks my heart.  At least in the old system she had a chance every now and then."
08-09-2019T12:58:05,CrimsonQuill,Oh hello Tom
08-09-2019T12:58:33,CrimsonQuill,@Windows998SE Never drawn again? What's stacked against her?
08-09-2019T12:58:41,CrimsonQuill,@Windows98SE
08-09-2019T13:05:24,WINDOWS98SE,"Don't see how she'll ever be sketched again.  No matter what the suggestion is, she'll never get enough votes."
08-09-2019T13:05:30,WINDOWS98SE,"On the old polls, things were randomally split into four rounds and there was a different voting base.  There was always a chance she'd win, but not now."
08-09-2019T13:05:38,WINDOWS98SE,"For example, take a look at the hen house suggestion, done OKish in the Patreon vote, but still not well enough to ever come close to winning.  Yet she nearly won a few weeks ago when tkpolls was used."
08-09-2019T13:08:25,CrimsonQuill,I see.
08-09-2019T13:09:13,CrimsonQuill,"Well, I feel a little frustrated too sometimes-my suggestion hasn't been doing well in the patreon polls, but the very first time I suggested it, on TKPolls, it got 2nd place in the vote. I am still holding out hope that Tom will pick it, however."
08-09-2019T13:12:39,WINDOWS98SE,At least you still have hope of Tom picking your suggestion.  I personally don't see Tom picking Laura again after finding out he rejected Iliar's Laura Nora card.
08-09-2019T13:16:32,CrimsonQuill,What was Iliar's nora card?
08-09-2019T13:16:45,WINDOWS98SE,Angel and Devil Laura.
08-09-2019T13:29:26,CrimsonQuill,"Ok, I see."

08-09-2019T13:47:58,WINDOWS98SE,"Yeah, you said on discord Tom ""does not see how to turn this sketch into a full-fledged""."
08-09-2019T13:48:04,WINDOWS98SE,"I get the impression Tom either doesn't like the character, or just doesn't care enough to put some thought into her."

08-09-2019T13:59:59,TeapotOfDoom,this either go horribly wrong or horribly wrong

08-09-2019T14:00:17,tehbear,cold?

08-09-2019T14:01:36,tehbear,I am also tired from staying up late yesterday
08-09-2019T14:01:51,tehbear,fell asleep just after sketch 4
08-09-2019T14:02:08,CrimsonQuill,I stayed the whole thing
08-09-2019T14:02:09,TeapotOfDoom,Hi tehbear and quill
08-09-2019T14:02:16,CrimsonQuill,But was wrecked afterwards
08-09-2019T14:02:34,TeapotOfDoom,well that's what you get for being european and a tk fan
08-09-2019T14:02:50,TeapotOfDoom,i was glad i could sleep till 10
08-09-2019T14:03:02,TeapotOfDoom,yeah it be cold in my house
08-09-2019T14:03:27,tehbear,make a hot cup of tea?
08-09-2019T14:03:29,TeapotOfDoom,also does anybody know how to create a simulated umts network? i wanna try some stuff
08-09-2019T14:03:38,TeapotOfDoom,starts boiling
08-09-2019T14:03:44,tehbear,umts?
08-09-2019T14:03:50,CrimsonQuill,I'd love tea
08-09-2019T14:04:02,TeapotOfDoom,actually good idea... i should still have some of the only tea i actully enjoy
08-09-2019T14:04:09,TeapotOfDoom,cell carrier
08-09-2019T14:04:25,TeapotOfDoom,i wanna try setup a cell network provider basically
08-09-2019T14:04:42,TeapotOfDoom,without radio towers tho
08-09-2019T14:04:52,TeapotOfDoom,that's too much work (for now)
08-09-2019T14:04:58,tehbear,what can you do with it?
08-09-2019T14:05:33,TeapotOfDoom,friend of mine had an idea and i want to understand the network layout to get an idea if it's actually possible or not
08-09-2019T14:06:44,TeapotOfDoom,but the problem is that phone networks are ancient technology and they have to be able to fall back to older stuff if the newer technologies fail
08-09-2019T14:07:30,TeapotOfDoom,and the idea changes the principle of calling someone so fundamentally that it kinda has to be backwards compatible
08-09-2019T14:07:49,TeapotOfDoom,but actually no it has not
08-09-2019T14:07:55,TeapotOfDoom,i have an idea
08-09-2019T14:11:04,RimaDraws,Ugh too hot out

08-09-2019T22:28:33,Ordithus,It's only 1/4 the way through its life
08-09-2019T22:29:10,SpazztasticKiwi,he estimates a new starter to be $100ish
08-09-2019T22:29:14,SpazztasticKiwi,he doesn’t do cars
08-09-2019T22:29:36,Ordithus,That's about what a battery runs
08-09-2019T22:29:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"while nor do I, I don’t see that being any kind of right"
08-09-2019T22:30:00,Ordithus,Starter and installation is probably closer to $400-500
08-09-2019T22:30:11,SpazztasticKiwi,and the battery’s only dead cause he never got a new starter
08-09-2019T22:30:25,Ordithus,I find that claim very suspect
08-09-2019T22:30:37,SpazztasticKiwi,it would definitely stand to have a peak at the tires for all that sitting too
08-09-2019T22:30:47,SpazztasticKiwi,I work with him

08-09-2019T22:31:58,SpazztasticKiwi,instead of fixing the car eventually or really it seems even trying to get to fixing it it looks like he’s gonna try selling it
08-09-2019T22:32:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"or after that, selling it as scrap"
08-09-2019T22:32:43,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m looking for me a car but he’s a smoker so I pass

08-09-2019T22:33:01,SpazztasticKiwi,and that’s nowhere near what I want anyway
