10-03-2019T13:11:20,SpazztasticKiwi,I no longer have a 6s+

10-03-2019T13:31:26,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-KeithNeat:
10-03-2019T13:56:37,SpazztasticKiwi,👋🏻 from my new XR
10-03-2019T14:28:45,Twokinds,"Wow, what happened."
10-03-2019T14:28:54,Twokinds,"I went to bed, and woke up at 3pm in the afternoon"
10-03-2019T14:30:25,TerraTheWizard,dst messing with ya?
10-03-2019T14:30:52,Twokinds,"Oh, so it's actually 2pm"
10-03-2019T14:31:07,Twokinds,"Well, that's a little better. Still late. Man"
10-03-2019T14:31:23,Twokinds,Congrats on the XR
10-03-2019T14:31:32,Twokinds,Whatever that is
10-03-2019T14:34:35,SpazztasticKiwi,New phone
10-03-2019T14:34:49,SpazztasticKiwi,And I wish I’d had that
10-03-2019T14:35:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I got up at 10:30. Stuff to do and tomorrow we go to Tupelo
10-03-2019T14:35:55,SpazztasticKiwi,When’d you go to bed
10-03-2019T14:38:52,Twokinds,I slept really badly the night before
10-03-2019T14:39:06,Twokinds,I guess my body was making up for lost time.
10-03-2019T15:12:28,qwe304,https://imgur.com/a/RtUC67l is this maren or saria?
10-03-2019T15:22:33,tehbear,Maren. i think Saria has a different hairstyle
10-03-2019T15:29:40,TerraTheWizard,"yeah, that's maren"
10-03-2019T16:30:17,Dadrobit,So it's officially Spring Break. Wana know how I know? All of my siblings who have their own children all independently called me to ask if I could babysit for them at the same time.
10-03-2019T16:30:38,TerraTheWizard,oof
10-03-2019T16:33:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Get pool noodles. Invite them all over. Tell them they must duel to win a babysitter
10-03-2019T16:37:14,Dadrobit,"We actually used to do that as kids. Cut PVC pipe to the length of whatever weapon you wanted, cut a pool noodle slightly shorter to slide on it and still give yourself a grip. Then go ham."
10-03-2019T16:37:38,Dadrobit,"Ah, and duct tape to keep it in place."
10-03-2019T16:45:02,SpazztasticKiwi,"I thought of saying to include pipes but if the kids would be around, as likely, wouldn’t want to seem as a bad influence"
10-03-2019T16:45:58,Dadrobit,"Ehhhhh, my brothers and I beat the living shit outta each other and we turned out just fine!"
10-03-2019T16:48:55,Bgrmystr2,just leave the brooms out of it.
10-03-2019T16:49:49,Dadrobit,"I agreed to take my niece, she's old enough to chill and actually interesting conversation."
10-03-2019T16:50:05,Dadrobit,hold interesting*
10-03-2019T17:05:54,SpazztasticKiwi,How’d autocorrect turn hold into actually
10-03-2019T17:06:16,SpazztasticKiwi,And on the sibling thing I don’t have brothers. Not a one
10-03-2019T17:12:06,Dadrobit,actually hold interesting*

10-03-2019T18:37:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve been on a near three hour clean-a-thon and my vacuum is probably ready to cry
10-03-2019T18:40:04,RimaDraws,good
10-03-2019T18:59:57,SpazztasticKiwi,The new camera on this phones so good I can see Bagheera’s lil whiskers in low light

10-03-2019T19:46:15,RimaDraws,oh boy smoke alarm went off
10-03-2019T19:46:37,CrRAR,damn
10-03-2019T19:47:04,CrRAR,I'm hoping for your sake someone is just REALLY bad at toasting toast.
10-03-2019T19:47:51,RimaDraws,no it was pork chops in the oven
10-03-2019T19:48:07,CrRAR,rip
10-03-2019T19:48:27,CrRAR,salvageable?
10-03-2019T19:49:57,RimaDraws,well they arent burnt
10-03-2019T19:50:03,RimaDraws,so i may just use the frying pan
10-03-2019T19:50:54,RimaDraws,i wanted to bake them
10-03-2019T19:54:23,CrRAR,"oo, yeah, sounds like the sauces may have just smoked up a little."
10-03-2019T19:55:11,CrRAR,Baking things for some reason imparts cozy thoughts.

10-03-2019T19:55:37,CrRAR,:cookie::cookie::cookie:
10-03-2019T19:57:00,RimaDraws,yea maybe the olive oil was a bit of a dumb choice
10-03-2019T19:58:00,Ordithus,Olive oil can be very smokey
10-03-2019T19:58:12,CrRAR,"ahh, yeah olive oil can be fickle. Low smoke temp, esp if it was virgin or extra virgin. You can fry things in regular though."
10-03-2019T19:58:25,RimaDraws,yea ><
10-03-2019T19:58:57,CrRAR,"virgin/extra is literally only for use on salads, too much planty molecules."
10-03-2019T19:59:05,CrRAR,:seedling:
10-03-2019T19:59:15,RimaDraws,i used it in the oven with the chicken before the pork chops
10-03-2019T19:59:31,RimaDraws,so i dont see why it made smoke with the porkchops and not the chicken
10-03-2019T19:59:52,RimaDraws,and i used a different pan

10-03-2019T20:05:52,Bgrmystr2,Oh Shit indeed..
10-03-2019T20:06:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Yes this is a weird food but anyone has spoon bread
10-03-2019T20:07:15,RimaDraws,no
10-03-2019T20:08:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Well it’s basically bread with corn
10-03-2019T20:08:30,SpazztasticKiwi,And jalapeños and an egg and corn meal and cream cheese
10-03-2019T20:11:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Brand new stereo speakers+ Volume on full blast = HELLOEVERYBODYMYNAMEISMARKIPLIER
10-03-2019T20:11:40,SpazztasticKiwi,But ya. The breads good
10-03-2019T20:24:11,Ordithus,Feeeesh was good

10-03-2019T20:40:13,RimaDraws,so anyone seen russian doll on netflix?
10-03-2019T20:40:28,RimaDraws,i am on the 6th out of 8 eps and i am trying to understand it
10-03-2019T20:47:25,CrRAR,Haven't seen it but sounds a bit like Groundhog Day. She has to unravel the mystery of her purpose on that night or be doomed to relive it indefinitely?
10-03-2019T20:48:21,RimaDraws,yea and im trying to figure out why they keep dying
10-03-2019T20:48:22,CrRAR,GOTTA SOCIALIZE FAST-
10-03-2019T20:48:49,CrRAR,Does she just die like spontaneously?
10-03-2019T20:49:25,RimaDraws,her and this one guy die at the same time but sometimes different ways. but only once have they died from the same thing. and they just spawn back to where they started
10-03-2019T20:50:11,RimaDraws,so her and this other guy who has the same problem are working on why they are dying
10-03-2019T20:53:11,CrRAR,Sounds like a metaphoric critique on navigating complex social circles in today's society.
10-03-2019T20:53:38,CrRAR,Just gotta SCHMOOZE your way to the top~
10-03-2019T20:55:02,CrRAR,"Also, from your description it reminds me of those ULTRA tense games of minesweeper xD"

10-03-2019T21:05:18,SpazztasticKiwi,So Tom this is a late question but when you got up so late today
10-03-2019T21:05:32,SpazztasticKiwi,feel like you time traveled?
10-03-2019T21:06:51,Twokinds,yea
10-03-2019T21:07:07,RimaDraws,hi tom
10-03-2019T21:18:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Nice
10-03-2019T21:19:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I might go to bed at toddler bedtime
10-03-2019T21:19:51,SpazztasticKiwi,I was up too early myself. Slept about like a toddler last night too
10-03-2019T21:35:30,SpazztasticKiwi,But did anyone else see the story with the lady getting mauled by a jaguar at the zoo? You’ll never guess how it happened
10-03-2019T21:36:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Well “mauled”. She got her arm slashed up
10-03-2019T21:44:01,Bgrmystr2,"what'd she do, jump into the cage like a dumb?"
10-03-2019T21:44:09,Bgrmystr2,then blame the zoo
10-03-2019T21:44:27,Bgrmystr2,sounds about the normal if I had to guess
10-03-2019T21:54:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Ill give you a small ding for that one. You’re close
10-03-2019T21:54:44,SpazztasticKiwi,She hopped the safety fence for a selfie
10-03-2019T21:56:06,SpazztasticKiwi,But surprisingly she returned later to apologize and admit fault. Though she called it a “crazy accident”. The zoos already made it clear they will do nothing to the animal as it was obviously not at fault
10-03-2019T21:56:35,SpazztasticKiwi,"As PhilyD says “don’t be stupid, stupid”"
10-03-2019T21:58:10,Bgrmystr2,jumped the fence to take a selfie..
10-03-2019T21:58:15,Bgrmystr2,she deserved it
10-03-2019T22:00:39,RimaDraws,i get why this show is called russian doll now
10-03-2019T22:35:48,SpazztasticKiwi,The plot folds into itself? The characters are interfolded versions of each other?
10-03-2019T22:36:31,RimaDraws,multiple realities
10-03-2019T22:41:28,SpazztasticKiwi,heh. Origami demintions
10-03-2019T22:41:50,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m 🛌
