19-05-2019T00:02:33,BadFoMo,"Also, don't we always do that?"
19-05-2019T00:15:19,Dadrobit,Howdy y'all!
19-05-2019T00:15:24,Dadrobit,How was the stream?

19-05-2019T00:15:50,Ordithus,Stream was :ctwokinds-wink::ctwokinds-katdryer::ctwokinds-daydreamingkat::ctwokinds-katwet::ctwokinds-KatDance:
19-05-2019T00:15:58,unsteddyphoenix,"extremely good, in other words"
19-05-2019T00:16:31,Dadrobit,"I want to make a joke here, but I won't."
19-05-2019T00:16:46,unsteddyphoenix,I would prune it
19-05-2019T00:16:52,Dadrobit,"Just got back from John Wick, 20/10 would see again."
19-05-2019T00:17:03,unsteddyphoenix,Oh yeah?
19-05-2019T00:17:04,Ordithus,"Nice, someone else said it was good"
19-05-2019T00:17:13,unsteddyphoenix,Havent even seen the ogs
19-05-2019T00:17:15,unsteddyphoenix,its on the list
19-05-2019T00:17:22,Dadrobit,It was awesome as all get out.
19-05-2019T00:18:15,Dadrobit,Though someone brough a small child. Maybe 5 or 6. Folks need to not do that.
19-05-2019T00:18:19,Dadrobit,brought*
19-05-2019T00:18:25,Bgrmystr2,I thought both movies were at already?
19-05-2019T00:18:31,Bgrmystr2,were out*
19-05-2019T00:18:41,Dadrobit,This is the third one.
19-05-2019T00:18:50,Bgrmystr2,..ah I did not know there was a third
19-05-2019T00:19:00,Ordithus,I just came out

19-05-2019T00:19:24,Dadrobit,:ptv-condescending:
19-05-2019T00:19:34,Bgrmystr2,"yup, taking that."
19-05-2019T00:19:39,Bgrmystr2,Thanks ord.
19-05-2019T00:19:44,Ordithus,Shit
19-05-2019T00:19:52,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-laugh:
19-05-2019T00:19:55,unsteddyphoenix,congrats ord
19-05-2019T00:20:04,unsteddyphoenix,What are you doing later~
19-05-2019T00:20:04,Dadrobit,Probably the best of the series so far imho.
19-05-2019T00:20:18,unsteddyphoenix,Woah. Thats rare for this kinda thing
19-05-2019T00:20:30,Ordithus,"Well, considering the content of 4/6 of my most recent suggestions to get drawn..."
19-05-2019T00:20:58,Dadrobit,Keanu Reeves is such a damned good actor in this roll.
19-05-2019T00:21:01,unsteddyphoenix,Haha oh yeah
19-05-2019T00:21:02,Dadrobit,role*
19-05-2019T00:21:10,unsteddyphoenix,"Nice, im in"
19-05-2019T00:21:13,Dadrobit,Though rolling does occur.
19-05-2019T00:23:30,Ordithus,John Wick rolls a lot
19-05-2019T00:24:18,Ordithus,Teddy I'm pretty open~
19-05-2019T00:24:40,Dadrobit,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7XM597XO94 Trailer for the third.
19-05-2019T00:25:41,unsteddyphoenix,Ive sworn off trailers
19-05-2019T00:26:20,unsteddyphoenix,"Great, i'll pick you up at 8 honey"
19-05-2019T00:26:30,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-rainehappy:
19-05-2019T00:27:06,Dadrobit,"unsteddy, it has puppies."
19-05-2019T00:27:38,unsteddyphoenix,hmm
19-05-2019T00:27:41,unsteddyphoenix,ok im sold
19-05-2019T00:30:05,unsteddyphoenix,lmao I like how she was talking all seriously over the dogs head
19-05-2019T00:30:21,unsteddyphoenix,And the dogs just like :D
19-05-2019T00:30:41,Ordithus,"""Imma dog!"""
19-05-2019T00:31:04,Dadrobit,Those were 10/10 puppers in the movie.
19-05-2019T00:39:45,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
19-05-2019T00:45:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Dadro you remember that react video I sent? Were you ever interested in seeing more of the same weird
19-05-2019T00:48:26,Dadrobit,Sure?
19-05-2019T00:49:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Original video or react video - which you want
19-05-2019T00:50:20,SpazztasticKiwi,"And it‚Äôs legit on the disturbingly weird, I warn"
19-05-2019T00:50:24,Dadrobit,original
19-05-2019T00:51:43,SpazztasticKiwi,I could only stomach a little bit before my weird meter busted and sent me off so enjoy
19-05-2019T00:56:57,Dadrobit,"Well, that was a little different I suppose."
19-05-2019T00:58:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Was that a gentlemanly ‚Äúwtf‚Äù?
19-05-2019T00:59:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Or have I not found anything truly surprisingly weird
19-05-2019T00:59:35,Dadrobit,"I'm nothing if not a gentleman. Also, the video I sent, at around the 2 minute mark, I imagine what's what they were singing about."
19-05-2019T00:59:47,Dadrobit,that's what*
19-05-2019T01:01:47,Dadrobit,It seemed too genuine to be weird imo. Like it was just sad instead.
19-05-2019T01:02:21,SpazztasticKiwi,You sent somethin?
19-05-2019T01:02:55,Dadrobit,"Yeah, whispered it."
19-05-2019T01:03:23,Dadrobit,You have whispers disabled
19-05-2019T01:03:43,Dadrobit,"Odd, it showed the first message going through fine"
19-05-2019T01:03:58,SpazztasticKiwi,They had to be turned back on for me to send that. Didn‚Äôt turn em back off
19-05-2019T01:04:26,Dadrobit,""" This user has whispers disabled! You cannot whisper to them."""
19-05-2019T01:04:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Nm - there was no notification
19-05-2019T01:05:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Ya like I said I saw a bit of it. But like the Vegan Vag Juice guy I peaced out
19-05-2019T01:05:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh yeah. More info on the Swchwarsnegger kicker - dude supposedly broke his leg
19-05-2019T01:07:12,Bgrmystr2,he broke his own leg kicking arnold?
19-05-2019T01:07:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"I try spelling the name, autocorrect fills it in for me. I then learn how to spell it, and autocorrect changes what it told me was"
19-05-2019T01:07:53,Bgrmystr2,xD
19-05-2019T01:08:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Logic. And apparently yes. Arnold went on to say he had originally thought it was just the crowd jostling him. But he was happy the guy didn‚Äôt mess up his snapchat
19-05-2019T01:08:34,Bgrmystr2,lol yeah
19-05-2019T01:08:40,Bgrmystr2,"well the dude deserved it, the fuck was the kick for?"
19-05-2019T01:08:46,Bgrmystr2,trying to kill the terminator or somethin?
19-05-2019T01:08:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Probably
19-05-2019T01:09:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Some people will try to punch a celebrity just to say they did
19-05-2019T01:11:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Fame gets a target on your back
19-05-2019T01:11:40,SpazztasticKiwi,And some will break their own legs to hit it
19-05-2019T01:11:51,Bgrmystr2,hope it hurt
19-05-2019T01:11:59,Bgrmystr2,cuz fuck that dude for being a dumb
19-05-2019T01:12:27,SpazztasticKiwi,He‚Äôd probably like that
19-05-2019T01:13:02,Bgrmystr2,maybe not if you used excalibolg.
19-05-2019T01:13:09,Bgrmystr2,Just go with that.
19-05-2019T01:13:57,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôll tell people to get friendly with a flaming cactus
19-05-2019T01:14:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Not my go to insult but it applies sometimes
19-05-2019T01:16:09,Bgrmystr2,"Honestly.. I'm.. almost sure that a flaming cactus would hurt less than excalibolg, but the cactus would likely last wayyy longer so.."
19-05-2019T01:16:17,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-wondering:
19-05-2019T01:16:54,SpazztasticKiwi,"If you don‚Äôt know cacti, there‚Äôs a variant with hair like spines. Absolute hell to get out and they shed like, well, hair"
19-05-2019T01:17:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Imagine one of those up in there
19-05-2019T01:17:53,Bgrmystr2,oh yeah I know.
19-05-2019T01:18:40,Bgrmystr2,I've seen enough japan to get the gist of where that's going. I still think excalibolg would be worse.
19-05-2019T01:19:00,Bgrmystr2,but your cactus is likely an alternative solution.
19-05-2019T01:19:07,Bgrmystr2,so I also support it.
19-05-2019T01:20:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Curious to see how a taser up theirs would work out in a way
19-05-2019T01:20:27,SpazztasticKiwi,French fried insides maybe
19-05-2019T01:20:47,Bgrmystr2,:zap::zap: zzzzzzap
19-05-2019T01:21:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"But if all else fails call em a dildo. Like, id call you a dick, but you‚Äôre not real enough"
19-05-2019T01:22:48,Bgrmystr2,xD
19-05-2019T01:24:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve been told I‚Äôm too much sometimes. Helps me learn who not to date
19-05-2019T01:29:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve learned what live doll is and now I wanna leave the planet
19-05-2019T01:59:38,SpazztasticKiwi,"Ah, another thing about the Schwarzenegger thing - it was a wrestling, bodybuilding, combat sports con thing"
19-05-2019T02:00:28,SpazztasticKiwi,That guy looked lighter than me. The crown of idiocy goes to
19-05-2019T02:08:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Original snap is expired but people saved it unsurprisingly. I‚Äôm off to sleep soon I guess üõå

19-05-2019T12:14:50,CrimsonQuill,But these are good ones.
19-05-2019T12:14:52,CrimsonQuill,:)
19-05-2019T12:18:06,CrimsonQuill,Especially Adira's aunt meeting Maeve. Sweet!
19-05-2019T12:18:35,CrimsonQuill,Back soon-need dinner
19-05-2019T13:09:24,CrimsonQuill,Woah.
19-05-2019T13:09:32,CrimsonQuill,I've just seen the new strip and...well...
19-05-2019T13:09:38,CrimsonQuill,Character Development incoming.
19-05-2019T13:11:27,CrimsonQuill,Also...Rose's method...a bit...extreme...
19-05-2019T13:11:43,Twokinds,Probably not the best teacher
19-05-2019T13:12:10,CrimsonQuill,"I can see good intentions, and she's right about Raine viewing her ability the wrong way..."
19-05-2019T13:12:20,CrimsonQuill,But a slave collar might not be the best way to do it.
19-05-2019T13:12:36,CrimsonQuill,"Wow, Tom. You really take the time to write your characters..."
19-05-2019T13:15:31,CrimsonQuill,Looking through the forum on all the fan theories is enlightening too.
19-05-2019T13:15:49,CrimsonQuill,"Blast it, now I can't wait for the next strip! XD"
19-05-2019T13:16:11,Twokinds,Living with Trace for a long time may have twisted Rose's moral compass a bit.
19-05-2019T13:16:44,CrimsonQuill,That kind of makes sense now you bring it up...
19-05-2019T13:17:08,CrimsonQuill,"And of course, her bitterness over Euchre's selfishness might've been a bit nasty...and Saria's death..."
19-05-2019T13:17:45,CrimsonQuill,"I'm trying to decide whether she knows what she's doing, has some big plan in the back of her head, or is trying to help but is pushing too hard..."
19-05-2019T13:18:37,TeapotOfDoom,Well tbh i can kinda see her logic
19-05-2019T13:19:36,CrimsonQuill,"Oh, Tom, Btw, may I please ask a favour?"
19-05-2019T13:19:41,CrimsonQuill,Another one...
19-05-2019T13:19:44,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-redrose:
19-05-2019T13:19:46,TeapotOfDoom,Raine's afraid of a wolf side that does not actually exist. They collar only has effects on keidran so it's kind of a proof that she's in fact not an actual wolf
19-05-2019T13:20:10,TeapotOfDoom,Or something like that
19-05-2019T13:20:23,CrimsonQuill,"@TeapotOfDoom I think she's also trying to tell Raine not to think of herself as different forms, but to accept herself."
19-05-2019T13:20:32,TeapotOfDoom,Indeed
19-05-2019T13:20:54,CrimsonQuill,Her mother's rather questionable methods of raising her mean that she's rather reluctant to embrace herself.
19-05-2019T13:21:40,CrimsonQuill,"She wants keidran and humans to get along together, but at the same time, her mother's put it into her that her own keidran side is a bad thing..."
19-05-2019T13:22:32,CrimsonQuill,"Along with her fear of going feral...although now I think about it, there does seem to be a limited window in which feral keidran can pull themselves back when they're finished (like Flora), and maintain their normal intelligence"
19-05-2019T13:22:45,CrimsonQuill,Raine has a lot to learn...
19-05-2019T13:22:56,CrimsonQuill,"But then again, Rose has a bit to learn too"
19-05-2019T13:23:48,TeapotOfDoom,The whole family kinda has issues
19-05-2019T13:24:06,CrimsonQuill,True.
19-05-2019T13:24:27,CrimsonQuill,"But anyhow, I almost forgot..."
19-05-2019T13:24:53,TeapotOfDoom,"Raine's the most normal of them imo (which kinda sounds weird tbh), she's just scared"
19-05-2019T13:25:09,CrimsonQuill,She just want's friends and to fit in.
19-05-2019T13:25:13,CrimsonQuill,wants.
19-05-2019T13:25:31,CrimsonQuill,"And she, rather sadly, sees her halfkind and keidran sides as barriers..."
19-05-2019T13:26:04,CrimsonQuill,"Even Red's trying to help her in this regard. He might still have some racism left over, but he's trying to be nicer and more thoughtful."
19-05-2019T13:26:16,CrimsonQuill,And Maren gave her a groom and a nice chat.
19-05-2019T13:26:26,CrimsonQuill,Not to mention that Karen couldn't care less.
19-05-2019T13:26:52,CrimsonQuill,And post-amnesia Trace probably wouldn't give a fig either...
19-05-2019T13:29:05,TeapotOfDoom,I think she fits into that group better then she thinks she does
19-05-2019T13:29:28,CrimsonQuill,The only problem is the society as a whole. That's the struggle.
19-05-2019T13:30:12,CrimsonQuill,"Well, there's also the war...and the fact that one of the protaganists has TWO superpowered evil sides, one of which is mr Evil Black Smoke Hallucination..."
19-05-2019T13:30:29,CrimsonQuill,And the inherent snobbyness within each race towards each other...
19-05-2019T13:30:35,CrimsonQuill,Oh dear.
19-05-2019T13:31:24,TeapotOfDoom,I wonder what is stored in the locked room on the third floor if I recall correctly
19-05-2019T13:32:17,TeapotOfDoom,Gonna be a fun time. They have built up quite the hatred against each other especially humans and canines
19-05-2019T13:32:37,CrimsonQuill,It has to end somehow...
19-05-2019T13:32:50,CrimsonQuill,I know there's going to be something terrible happening soon.
19-05-2019T13:33:01,CrimsonQuill,That seems pretty much unavoidable.
19-05-2019T13:33:08,CrimsonQuill,"But in the end, when the dust settles..."
19-05-2019T13:33:14,CrimsonQuill,Surely there's a better way.
19-05-2019T13:33:21,CrimsonQuill,It won't start easily.
19-05-2019T13:33:35,CrimsonQuill,Mistrust remains long after conflict ends...
19-05-2019T13:33:54,TeapotOfDoom,That's the issue
19-05-2019T13:34:03,TeapotOfDoom,Gonna be interesting
19-05-2019T13:34:05,CrimsonQuill,"But if they can just duct tape the world enough so that it doesn't fall apart immediately, they can then work on a long term solution."
19-05-2019T13:34:09,CrimsonQuill,With more Duct tape.
19-05-2019T13:34:21,CrimsonQuill,And stronger joints.
19-05-2019T13:34:42,TeapotOfDoom,You can build anything out of duct tape so probably the best solution
19-05-2019T13:35:14,TeapotOfDoom,Even a canoe
19-05-2019T13:35:31,CrimsonQuill,As Florence Ambrose says in Freefall:
19-05-2019T13:35:49,CrimsonQuill,"""Power corrupts, but the power of Duct Tape corrupts Absolutely."""
19-05-2019T13:36:12,TeapotOfDoom,Haha
19-05-2019T13:39:45,CrimsonQuill,"Anyhow, what was I going to ask Tom?"
19-05-2019T13:39:49,CrimsonQuill,"Oh, yes!"
19-05-2019T13:40:30,CrimsonQuill,"Tom, I was wondering if I may please have your permission to incorporate a few of your characters into a Halo fanon storyline/setting/art series/thing I've been dreaming up for a while."
19-05-2019T13:40:40,CrimsonQuill,Because of the Halo Raine pic.
19-05-2019T13:41:14,CrimsonQuill,"As long as I credit your characters, I wanted to make backstories for the Halo versions of them to go along with my Halo OCs..."
19-05-2019T13:41:44,CrimsonQuill,Because I'm a bit queasy about doing it without asking.
19-05-2019T14:00:12,CrimsonQuill,Did I scare Tom off again?
19-05-2019T14:00:22,TeapotOfDoom,Seems like it
19-05-2019T14:00:28,CrimsonQuill,Bother.
19-05-2019T14:08:17,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
19-05-2019T14:08:39,CrimsonQuill,Ummm...Tom? You still there?
19-05-2019T14:08:43,TeapotOfDoom,Hi Terra!
19-05-2019T14:08:47,CrimsonQuill,Hi Terra!
19-05-2019T14:08:54,CrimsonQuill,:ptv-greetings:
19-05-2019T14:08:57,TerraTheWizard,"oh nice, new emote"
19-05-2019T14:09:03,CrimsonQuill,I done goofed :ptv-uneasy:
19-05-2019T14:09:05,SniperJackal,"Crimson I see you are a halo fan aswell, a man of culture"
19-05-2019T14:09:24,TerraTheWizard,"what'd i miss, i've been gone like 2 hours"
19-05-2019T14:09:35,TerraTheWizard,and accidentally refreshed the chat
19-05-2019T14:09:44,CrimsonQuill,"Thanks Teapot! Heh, my best friend and I are going to play every campaign on Legendary at the end of the month."
19-05-2019T14:10:00,CrimsonQuill,@TerraTheWizard we were discussing the new comic page.
19-05-2019T14:10:21,CrimsonQuill,Then I tried to ask Tom for permission to incorporate his characters into a Halo fanon timeline.
19-05-2019T14:10:29,CrimsonQuill,And probably scared him off.
19-05-2019T14:10:31,CrimsonQuill,:(
19-05-2019T14:10:38,TerraTheWizard,"just doot it, but give credit for the chars"
19-05-2019T14:10:52,TeapotOfDoom,He vanished
19-05-2019T14:11:44,CrimsonQuill,"@TeapotOfDoom I have actually only played 4 and Reach, but I know the stories of them all."
19-05-2019T14:12:01,TeapotOfDoom,I think you are confusing me with SniperJackal Quill
19-05-2019T14:12:28,TeapotOfDoom,I have like one or two hours in Halo and I don't even remember which it was
19-05-2019T14:12:32,CrimsonQuill,I fear the sniper Jackals.
19-05-2019T14:17:53,SniperJackal,how have you not played the other ones? dont you have the MCC?
19-05-2019T14:18:17,CrimsonQuill,No
19-05-2019T14:18:29,CrimsonQuill,My first Halo game was 2 years ago on my dad's Xbox 360
19-05-2019T14:18:41,CrimsonQuill,@TepotOfDoom sorry about the confusion
19-05-2019T14:18:47,CrimsonQuill,@TeapotOfDoom
19-05-2019T14:19:08,SniperJackal,Oh that makes sense
19-05-2019T14:19:09,CrimsonQuill,@SniperJackal I wasn't really able to play those games until then.
19-05-2019T14:19:27,SniperJackal,meanwhile I never had an xbox and am waiting for MCC to come to PC
19-05-2019T14:19:39,CrimsonQuill,"I picked up 4 in gamestop, thought, ""huh, this looks good"", remembered seeing a brickfilm about Halo or summat, and played it."
19-05-2019T14:19:42,CrimsonQuill,INSTANTLY HOOKED.
19-05-2019T14:19:46,CrimsonQuill,The story made me cry.
19-05-2019T14:19:54,CrimsonQuill,I found out more about it.
19-05-2019T14:19:57,SniperJackal,reach was dark yes
19-05-2019T14:20:05,CrimsonQuill,"No, this was Halo 4"
19-05-2019T14:20:12,CrimsonQuill,I played Reach Afterwards
19-05-2019T14:20:12,SniperJackal,oh shit
19-05-2019T14:20:15,CrimsonQuill,Granted it was dark
19-05-2019T14:20:22,SniperJackal,but halo 4 was really sad at the end
19-05-2019T14:20:24,SniperJackal,true
19-05-2019T14:20:25,TeapotOfDoom,No worries ^^ but i still can't assist with Halo trivia. Don't know anything about the franchise other than there's a Masterchief
19-05-2019T14:20:28,CrimsonQuill,But Cortana and Chief in Halo 4 made me weep.
19-05-2019T14:21:01,SniperJackal,I only played CE and 2 on PC
19-05-2019T14:21:06,CrimsonQuill,@TeapotOfDoom I think I reached the pinnacle of fan reaction seeing my sketch suggestion of Halo Raine come through
19-05-2019T14:21:19,CrimsonQuill,@SniperJackal I am eager for the MCC to come to PC.
19-05-2019T14:21:25,CrimsonQuill,A monument to all my sins...
19-05-2019T14:21:53,SniperJackal,I basically played CE to the point where I know the game to every single detail
19-05-2019T14:22:17,CrimsonQuill,I'm going to go through the meat grinder in 1-2-3.
19-05-2019T14:22:23,CrimsonQuill,Especially 2.
19-05-2019T14:22:32,CrimsonQuill,We're going to play them all in coop on Legendary.
19-05-2019T14:22:39,SniperJackal,good luck with halo 2
19-05-2019T14:22:41,CrimsonQuill,:)
19-05-2019T14:22:49,SniperJackal,I completed it on legendary without cheating
19-05-2019T14:22:54,SniperJackal,and it was extremely stressful
19-05-2019T14:23:08,CrimsonQuill,I also discovered Red vs Blue at Christmas.
19-05-2019T14:23:17,CrimsonQuill,Pure gold until season 15.
19-05-2019T14:23:25,SniperJackal,Oh RvB never really watched it thoroughly
19-05-2019T14:23:28,CrimsonQuill,Then during season 15 I lost heart...
19-05-2019T14:23:58,CrimsonQuill,"My recommendation: Start with the beginning, and go all the way to season 13. Watch season 14 if you like, but leave it there."
19-05-2019T14:24:11,CrimsonQuill,Because Season 15 was a bit of a dissapointment to be honest...
19-05-2019T14:24:16,CrimsonQuill,And Season 16 was worse.
19-05-2019T14:27:30,SniperJackal,looks like they dragged it for too long
19-05-2019T14:27:53,CrimsonQuill,It's just that it lost it's sparkle with the plot.
19-05-2019T14:28:05,CrimsonQuill,Seasons 6-13 especially are brilliant.
19-05-2019T14:28:07,CrimsonQuill,But...
19-05-2019T14:28:16,CrimsonQuill,15 not so much.
19-05-2019T14:29:14,CrimsonQuill,Be back in a bit
19-05-2019T14:29:22,CrimsonQuill,Shower and stuff
19-05-2019T14:35:41,FloofyCat,It was pure gold until around Halo 4 when the Freelancer arc ended.
19-05-2019T14:35:56,FloofyCat,I remember gleefully opening my laptop on a Tuesday every week to see the next episode.
19-05-2019T14:39:45,FloofyCat,then the stories kinda got dull.
19-05-2019T14:57:39,AspiringNoodle,I remember watching a few seasons before I slowly phased out.  Then I got linked an episode waaaaaaay further in.  And I couldn't stop laughing
19-05-2019T14:57:57,AspiringNoodle,The one where it's Tex v All
19-05-2019T15:33:36,Azumachan,:ctwokinds-FloDance:
19-05-2019T15:41:15,Azumachan,:ctwokinds-redrose: Nice.
19-05-2019T15:49:04,CrimsonQuill,Back
19-05-2019T15:49:17,CrimsonQuill,I loved Seasons 11-13 as much as the Freelancer arc
19-05-2019T15:53:05,CrimsonQuill,Especially the villains.
19-05-2019T15:53:11,CrimsonQuill,Very well fleshed out.
19-05-2019T15:53:15,CrimsonQuill,And the story.
19-05-2019T16:06:24,CommanderTrace,Hello ;D
19-05-2019T16:13:27,CrimsonQuill,Hullo
19-05-2019T16:13:43,CommanderTrace,where are you from ?

19-05-2019T16:15:07,CrimsonQuill,????
19-05-2019T16:16:01,CrimsonQuill,That's all
19-05-2019T16:19:53,CommanderTrace,are you advocating the brexit?
19-05-2019T16:20:09,CrimsonQuill,no comment
19-05-2019T16:21:24,CrimsonQuill,"Well, I need to go to bed."
19-05-2019T16:21:31,CrimsonQuill,Goodnight all!

19-05-2019T17:49:42,Bgrmystr2,"Rip, was gonna tell Quill the reason Karen doesn't seem to care about Raine's transformation is because she accepts her as who she is, whatever that happens to be, human, keidran, a bit of both, doesn't matter. Raine's still Raine."
19-05-2019T17:49:52,Bgrmystr2,Something Raine clearly does not understand and Karen does.
19-05-2019T17:50:19,Bgrmystr2,Something a lot of people in the fandom seem to miss.
19-05-2019T17:51:34,Bgrmystr2,"younger kids go with their gut and usually don't have issues with that, more rather with bad decisions because of immaturity"
19-05-2019T17:52:09,Bgrmystr2,adults second guess themselves all the time and as a result have issues despite maturing over years.
19-05-2019T17:52:20,Bgrmystr2,It's kinda sad.
19-05-2019T17:53:41,TerraTheWizard,myup

19-05-2019T22:19:11,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôll tell you something. A reason I don‚Äôt toss or throw many things and a reason I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not male is I can‚Äôt aim for shit
19-05-2019T22:19:32,SpazztasticKiwi,I can toss it but it‚Äôll end up in Timbuktu before it lands in your hand
19-05-2019T22:20:11,Bgrmystr2,Here's a secret. Not all guys can catch. Or perhaps more accurately they catch with their face.
19-05-2019T22:20:28,Bgrmystr2,"I am one of them. Can't catch things worth a shit, never could. No idea why."

19-05-2019T22:24:14,Dadrobit,Tip for getting folks to catch things: Throw towards their face. It makes it easier for them to keep their eyes on the target and catch it.
19-05-2019T22:24:15,SpazztasticKiwi,I did track. I can run but god help everyone if I‚Äôd tried shot put
19-05-2019T22:24:21,Bgrmystr2,we'd be out there playing skateboards like other hoomans
19-05-2019T22:25:04,SpazztasticKiwi,I take my contacts out at night and that‚Äôs it. Don‚Äôt ask me to help or do anything. It will be the blind helping the blind

19-05-2019T23:43:09,SpazztasticKiwi,And he‚Äôs still a scientist. But they‚Äôre very inhumane with their methods. Rex protests. Bro attempts to basically tase him into submission so they can put a control cooler on him
