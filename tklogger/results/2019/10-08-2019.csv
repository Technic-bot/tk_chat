10-08-2019T10:37:15,TeapotOfDoom,There's only one kind of tea sold in only one shop i know that i actually like
10-08-2019T10:40:53,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-clovisgirl_shake: everything I've ever known is a lie
10-08-2019T10:41:07,Ordithus,Teapot not drinking tea what is this
10-08-2019T11:07:40,TeapotOfDoom,Choas insues
10-08-2019T11:08:05,TeapotOfDoom,also took a nap cus tired. Feel way better now
10-08-2019T11:08:42,TeapotOfDoom,I found a program that allows me to rename my desktops and give them seperate wallpapers in windows
10-08-2019T11:08:50,TeapotOfDoom,my linux is still ded...

10-08-2019T11:11:00,Mikemkke034,Lol
10-08-2019T11:28:09,AspiringNoodle,I'm up
10-08-2019T11:28:37,AspiringNoodle,"Slept for close to 11 hours today, I believe"
10-08-2019T11:29:55,AspiringNoodle,"I think I'm salty because I was told 2nd shift at work was 2 - 10, and all my shifts end at 11 :ptv-pouty:"
10-08-2019T11:32:52,TeapotOfDoom,11 in the evening?
10-08-2019T11:33:31,AspiringNoodle,Yup
10-08-2019T11:36:54,AspiringNoodle,"I am NOT a morning person, lol"
10-08-2019T11:38:02,AspiringNoodle,"I'm the kind of person that goes to bed at 1 - 2 and wakes up at 7:30 - 8:30, and I like it that way ;)"
10-08-2019T12:03:11,TeapotOfDoom,i would consider 7:30 to 8:30 to be a morning person from my perspective
10-08-2019T12:03:36,TeapotOfDoom,so you're at work currently?
10-08-2019T12:03:44,AspiringNoodle,"Nope, I'm EST/EDT"
10-08-2019T12:03:59,AspiringNoodle,I go in in about 1:52
10-08-2019T12:04:38,AspiringNoodle,"So traditionally, work is 9 - 5, but more recently it seems like it's become 8 - 4 / 8 - 6"
10-08-2019T12:04:49,AspiringNoodle,But I feel like I'm a 10 - 6 kind of person ;D
10-08-2019T12:05:07,TeapotOfDoom,oh brain derp damn
10-08-2019T12:05:23,TeapotOfDoom,so it's 1pm for you now
10-08-2019T12:05:43,TeapotOfDoom,well my workplace is about 9 to whenever the hell i get tired
10-08-2019T12:06:19,TeapotOfDoom,most times 6?
10-08-2019T12:07:08,AspiringNoodle,"I just wish my job kept me stuck in the 2 - 10 sphere, instead of nudging me an hour later :ptv-unimpressed:"
10-08-2019T12:07:23,TeapotOfDoom,well that sucks
10-08-2019T12:07:29,AspiringNoodle,"It's like, what the hell"
10-08-2019T12:07:44,AspiringNoodle,"I was told 2nd shift was 2 - 10, and now I'm being scheduled to end my shift at 11?"
10-08-2019T12:07:54,AspiringNoodle,I feel lied to
10-08-2019T12:08:01,TeapotOfDoom,"they just went like ""yeah remember the times we discussed? fuck em you have to stay another hour"""
10-08-2019T12:08:07,TeapotOfDoom,or what
10-08-2019T12:08:21,AspiringNoodle,"So instead of working 2 - 10, it's 3 - 11"
10-08-2019T12:08:36,TeapotOfDoom,at least it's not 2-11
10-08-2019T12:08:45,AspiringNoodle,Still irritated though
10-08-2019T12:08:47,TeapotOfDoom,so whatching stream on mobile?
10-08-2019T12:09:04,AspiringNoodle,Won't have time for that
10-08-2019T12:09:32,AspiringNoodle,"I was okay with my shifts ending at 10, because at least I could catch the tail end of sketch streams if I worked Sundays"
10-08-2019T12:09:35,AspiringNoodle,But now I might miss them entirely
10-08-2019T12:09:49,TeapotOfDoom,Damn
10-08-2019T12:10:10,TeapotOfDoom,So it's a busy place on sundays?
10-08-2019T12:10:19,AspiringNoodle,"Opposite, lol"
10-08-2019T12:10:28,AspiringNoodle,I'm going in today for training because the place is usually so dead
10-08-2019T12:10:47,TeapotOfDoom,But still enough work to keep you from watching?
10-08-2019T12:11:03,TeapotOfDoom,Well at least you won't get bored then...
10-08-2019T12:11:05,AspiringNoodle,I'm working at a gas station / convenience store
10-08-2019T12:11:12,AspiringNoodle,So there'll always be something to do
10-08-2019T12:12:38,TeapotOfDoom,Do you already know how often you get scheduled for sundays?
10-08-2019T12:13:08,AspiringNoodle,"Nope.  While I have my work schedule for the week, I don't know if I'll only know a week or two weeks in advance"
10-08-2019T12:13:55,AspiringNoodle,"And given how most places outside of Corporate America love to tout ""flexible"" schedules, odds are my days on / days off will constantly switch up :/"
10-08-2019T12:15:14,TeapotOfDoom,Well sucks for planning... but at least you're not in the work on every single weekend position
10-08-2019T12:15:36,AspiringNoodle,I'm just wondering what my days will look like
10-08-2019T12:16:31,AspiringNoodle,"Only time will tell if I prefer working less days at 8 hours a piece, or if I like working more days at 5 hours"
10-08-2019T12:17:11,AspiringNoodle,Or if I'm going to haul ass to get into a job that is more stable / lets me define my hours xD
10-08-2019T12:24:15,CrimsonQuill,Evening all
10-08-2019T12:25:39,TeapotOfDoom,Time will tell
10-08-2019T12:25:50,TeapotOfDoom,Is it your first day there?

10-08-2019T12:30:35,CrimsonQuill,Technically it's not a 'delay' as it's not got a release date yet.
10-08-2019T12:30:50,CrimsonQuill,And 343 are trying to make sure that it's as polished as possible.

10-08-2019T12:38:51,SniperJackal,either rose or Saria
10-08-2019T12:39:01,CrimsonQuill,I doubt Saria
10-08-2019T12:39:02,SniperJackal,tho saria is more likely
10-08-2019T12:39:10,CrimsonQuill,She's buried by that cottage
10-08-2019T12:39:16,SniperJackal,oh true
10-08-2019T12:39:25,SniperJackal,but didnt he try reviving her
10-08-2019T12:39:25,CrimsonQuill,I sincerely doubt that it's an empty grave...
10-08-2019T12:39:34,CrimsonQuill,He did try reviving her.
10-08-2019T12:39:45,CrimsonQuill,And that's what almost killed him...drove him insane.
10-08-2019T12:39:56,CrimsonQuill,It was almost...two corpses in one grave.
10-08-2019T12:40:12,SniperJackal,its like quoting the graveminds

10-08-2019T15:04:03,CrimsonQuill,"Guys, any idea how long it'll be before the stream?"
10-08-2019T15:04:08,AnuSekaniArt,Yeee Cyberpunk Raine is awesome :D

10-08-2019T15:05:11,PalmettoPathfinder1,But I could be wrong.

10-08-2019T15:50:25,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Keidranized Amaterasu made in the top half of the votes.  Not bad.  Besides from what I can tell from the title, it was Ammy herself and not one of the TK characters dressed up as her.  Still, Maren in Nib's body is cool."
10-08-2019T15:50:32,Mippy,Next book launch merch....Nibbly shirts
10-08-2019T15:50:58,tehbear,"Nibs is actually in a western, and was challenged to a duel, but just recalled she forgot to bring her gun"

10-08-2019T15:53:37,tehbear,I liked the Wii version of Okami with the painting
10-08-2019T15:53:40,FoxxTrotter,Ey'dere.
10-08-2019T15:53:44,CrimsonQuill,Technically we've already had Okami Raine
10-08-2019T15:54:01,Mippy,I‚Äôd have to hook up my PS2 to play my copy of Okami...too much work
10-08-2019T15:54:09,tehbear,its also on PS4 these days
10-08-2019T15:54:11,FenceEqualizer,Oh man my suggestion dropped
10-08-2019T15:54:17,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Well, that was Okami Raine, but not actual Okami Amaterasu."
10-08-2019T15:54:30,PalmettoPathfinder1,That's a difference.
10-08-2019T15:54:53,tehbear,i feel they copied Okami in the Zelda Twilight game.
10-08-2019T15:55:03,Grishmark,Hello

10-08-2019T15:58:16,Mippy,Just want to sleep all the time
10-08-2019T15:58:25,TeapotOfDoom,Now we know why Maren panics so hard
10-08-2019T15:58:27,AnuSekaniArt,Today's been that day for me too
10-08-2019T15:59:32,TeapotOfDoom,"Not only is someone else trying to get at Sythe, even worse it's herself"
10-08-2019T16:00:43,Mippy,I need to dig out my marker pad
10-08-2019T16:00:51,McClaw,It looks as if someone other that Mrs Nibbly just snuggled up to Sythe.
10-08-2019T16:01:54,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Thats red, claw"

10-08-2019T16:02:49,CrimsonQuill,This is going to be really funny
10-08-2019T16:02:59,InTheLionsDen,Maren in a fursuit
10-08-2019T16:03:15,tehbear,just to confuse Sythe more

10-08-2019T16:03:42,McClaw,Cat Nora? :P
10-08-2019T16:03:54,McClaw,Human Nora? :P
10-08-2019T16:04:09,FloofyCat,I was just going to say Nora with a hat on as a cosplay
10-08-2019T16:04:10,SpazztasticKiwi,so Tom how was that 40 minutes of sleep you got
10-08-2019T16:04:12,TeapotOfDoom,Human Maren? Who knows at this point
10-08-2019T16:04:17,tehbear,maybe Nora did this
10-08-2019T16:04:21,FloofyCat,Is Picarto lagging for anyone else or just me?
10-08-2019T16:04:34,tehbear,or somebody didnt learn from messing with Traces magical artifacts
10-08-2019T16:04:36,ThingsAreMoving,It's ok for me.
10-08-2019T16:04:42,InTheLionsDen,It always lags a bit
10-08-2019T16:04:44,CrimsonQuill,It stopped lagging for me
10-08-2019T16:04:46,McClaw,"It's stranger for Picarto to *not* lag, FloofyCat."
10-08-2019T16:04:49,CrimsonQuill,so far

10-08-2019T16:05:19,CrimsonQuill,"Sythe can never really catch a break on the weirdness, can he?"
10-08-2019T16:05:23,MatyMaty,Picarto lag is weird. It varies a lot depending on the computer/device
10-08-2019T16:05:23,FreedomCrusader,"but on that note, watching this stream is relaxing but I need to go to bed, see ya guys"

10-08-2019T16:32:42,CrimsonHelsing,Lol good Wallace & Gfomit reference xD
10-08-2019T16:32:45,CrimsonQuill,Oh I get you
10-08-2019T16:32:48,RimaDraws,i had pigs in a blanket all my life with cheese and they are gross
10-08-2019T16:32:51,CrimsonHelsing,*gromit
10-08-2019T16:32:55,CrimsonQuill,"@CrimsonHelsing Yes, you got it!"
10-08-2019T16:33:08,Mippy,In your opinion. I happen to like them with cheese
10-08-2019T16:33:09,RimaDraws,also helsing if you want to stay with me you'd retract that statement
10-08-2019T16:33:12,CrimsonQuill,"@RimaDraws I actually used to be Lactose Intolerant, as dis my brother."
10-08-2019T16:33:17,CrimsonQuill,was
10-08-2019T16:33:19,CrimsonQuill,not dis
10-08-2019T16:33:24,CrimsonHelsing,:'(
10-08-2019T16:33:26,CrimsonQuill,We had to drink Soya and Goats milk
10-08-2019T16:33:36,CrimsonQuill,And we were gluten free too
10-08-2019T16:33:48,CrimsonQuill,Which made shopping and baking...complicated.
10-08-2019T16:33:49,RimaDraws,gluten free has aspartame and thats bad for you
10-08-2019T16:34:15,CrimsonQuill,"We couldn't digest it, Rima-and anyhow, it tasted alright"
10-08-2019T16:34:16,RimaDraws,anything sugar free
10-08-2019T16:34:22,CrimsonQuill,Not sugar free
10-08-2019T16:34:27,CrimsonQuill,Not really
10-08-2019T16:34:27,Katfeathers,For the most part gluten free is an unnecessary fad
10-08-2019T16:34:34,RimaDraws,well gluten free is not all good
10-08-2019T16:34:35,CrimsonQuill,@Katfeathers not for us
10-08-2019T16:34:46,thestooge2222,Nibbly is doing what Maren is too afraid to!
10-08-2019T16:34:49,AnuSekaniArt,Only a very small percentage of the population has an actual gluten intolerance
10-08-2019T16:34:52,CrRAR,haha
10-08-2019T16:34:53,CrimsonQuill,We got physically sick whenever we accidentally had even a little bit
10-08-2019T16:35:01,KiTA,Gluten Free is bad.  Because people think t's just a fad and people who are actually intolerant of gluten will get REALLY sick becuase of it
10-08-2019T16:35:04,CrimsonQuill,We became more tolerant as time went on thank god.
10-08-2019T16:35:12,McClaw,Intolerance or Celiacs.
10-08-2019T16:35:13,CrRAR,Nibbly just wants dat warm fuzz.
10-08-2019T16:35:18,KiTA,"So you have people just claiming gluten free, when it's not"
10-08-2019T16:35:31,Mippy,It‚Äôs a fad for most. My teacher is Celiac.
10-08-2019T16:35:37,CrimsonQuill,"If we had been Coeliacs, we would still be gluten free today."
10-08-2019T16:35:57,Katfeathers,"Sympathies if you actually are one of the few that actually have the allergy, but to the general public it's oversold"
10-08-2019T16:36:02,thestooge2222,My mom recently developed a gluten problem :disappointed:
10-08-2019T16:36:06,CrimsonQuill,"I remember one time we ate something on holiday, but it had gluten in it"
10-08-2019T16:36:13,CrimsonQuill,Cue agony

10-08-2019T16:36:37,Mippy,I had to adapt my banana bread recipe for a class party we had
10-08-2019T16:36:49,CrimsonQuill,It felt like the stomach was on fire.
10-08-2019T16:36:52,RimaDraws,banana bread is good cant have that
10-08-2019T16:36:57,CrRAR,*brings in a tray of bananas*
10-08-2019T16:37:06,McClaw,"Oh, I see -- she lkes the feel of fur in her cleavage. ;)"
10-08-2019T16:37:07,CrimsonQuill,We had to do this for YEARS untill we found we could eat it again.
10-08-2019T16:37:12,thestooge2222,We have brian reegan to ease her pain X D

10-08-2019T16:52:24,SniperJackal,@CrimsonQuill I was reacting to the WW3 message

10-08-2019T16:53:14,CrimsonQuill,@SniperJackal wouldn't WWIII be the thing for Fallout or something?

10-08-2019T17:31:38,CLOVISTV,t is The Brotherhood Inspired from the dark brothehrood from the elderScrolls or The Assassin brothehrood from Ac?

10-08-2019T18:29:53,CrimsonQuill,It's hard to get his mind going on a path
10-08-2019T18:29:55,Mippy,Awwww... Brutus is a fluffy dumb pupper
10-08-2019T18:29:57,TerraTheWizard,possibly the goodest

10-08-2019T19:31:57,IronHorseComics,their sports teams don't share the same colors so that's nice
10-08-2019T19:32:05,Mippy,Dose the K stand for Kitchen?
10-08-2019T19:32:17,IronHorseComics,...
10-08-2019T19:32:17,unsteddyphoenix,Heh keidran counting in months makes sense

10-08-2019T19:34:20,Ordithus,He has to look like he's not enjoying it
10-08-2019T19:34:22,IronHorseComics,he's just neutral
10-08-2019T19:34:54,NezumiYuki,"Ya know... When you think about it though... Keidran aging isn't that bad... Most RL pets don't live much longer than 15 years, so having double that... That's pretty amazing actually!"

10-08-2019T19:35:42,BadFoMo,Raine: It's weird being in a land where Keidran are the top race and Humans are the slave race.
10-08-2019T19:35:52,Twokinds,"Red's just concerned about that weirdo with the raining frogs, but Raine's pretty sure there's nothing to worry about"

10-08-2019T20:15:14,MoonDance,I mean both are made with alcohol so I think it's similar
10-08-2019T20:15:16,BadFoMo,I was wondering the same thing.
10-08-2019T20:15:32,IronHorseComics,no but I had a couple of instances where I accidentally tasted it on my hand while eating or trying to get something unstuck between my teeth because there weren't any tooth picks around
10-08-2019T20:15:42,IronHorseComics,it's not a taste you forget
10-08-2019T20:15:56,NezumiYuki,"It's funny but, originally alcoholic drinks were made merely to be strong enough to sterilize the drinking water, but along the way, folks found the buzz felt good so they kept making the percentage of alcohol stronger.  xD"

10-08-2019T22:38:19,Dadrobit,"But evidentially she didn't tell her children that they were just fostering the puppies, so they got super upset. And after her daughter started tearing up, she recanted her offer and told me ""congratulation on going to a new low Dadrobit"""
10-08-2019T22:38:31,Dadrobit,Congratulations*
10-08-2019T22:38:39,Dadrobit,Like what the actual fuck?!!?
10-08-2019T22:38:41,Ordithus,Damn
10-08-2019T22:39:14,Dadrobit,She took the puppies and her kids back to the car and then came back in and tried bargaining with me.
10-08-2019T22:40:18,Dadrobit,"Because our parents own and rent out the house next to me, she would offer me the puppy if I helped her convince the parents to evict the family living there so that she could move in instead."
10-08-2019T22:40:40,Dadrobit,Like fuck right the hell off.
10-08-2019T22:41:06,Dadrobit,That family has been fantastic renters and neighbors for damn near a decade.
10-08-2019T22:41:30,Dadrobit,I'm not going to try and put them out for a puppy.
10-08-2019T22:41:35,Ordithus,the hell
10-08-2019T22:42:01,Dadrobit,I am legitimately furious right now. Actually blood boilingly furious.
10-08-2019T22:42:43,Ordithus,Maan that sucks.
10-08-2019T22:45:22,Ordithus,"Get a drink or whatever, sit down, and do whatever you like to do to relax.  At least to help the boil turn to a simmer"
10-08-2019T22:47:44,SomeNiceUser,"Damn, that sucks big time."
10-08-2019T22:47:47,Ordithus,Did you see today's sketch?  :ctwokinds-rainehappy::ctwokinds-zenshocked:
10-08-2019T22:48:07,SomeNiceUser,Ima go check it out

10-08-2019T22:50:50,SomeNiceUser,Night Rima!
10-08-2019T22:52:33,Dadrobit,"Yeah, poured myself a glass of bourbon, gonna sit down and play some games or some shit."
10-08-2019T22:52:44,SomeNiceUser,"I‚Äôm looking through the recording. Looking at the first sketch, it‚Äôs lookin naughty."
10-08-2019T22:53:25,SomeNiceUser,Poor Maren.
10-08-2019T22:53:29,Ordithus,Hee yeah
10-08-2019T22:55:33,AspiringNoodle,I'm back
10-08-2019T22:55:41,AspiringNoodle,"And just like I thought, missed the end of the stream -_-"
10-08-2019T22:56:07,AspiringNoodle,"I'm also back like 30 - 35 minutes later I could've been because I decided to chat with a co-worker, but even then I'd have missed the stream by 10 - 15 minutes"
10-08-2019T22:57:56,SomeNiceUser,Hi Noodle!
10-08-2019T23:00:24,AspiringNoodle,I'm eating dinner and watching Youtube :D
10-08-2019T23:00:43,AspiringNoodle,Because the job only offers free drinks xD

10-08-2019T23:09:28,SomeNiceUser,So many interesting sketches today.
10-08-2019T23:10:57,Ordithus,Lotsa cute.  I guess that's pretty normal though!
10-08-2019T23:15:17,AspiringNoodle,"Oh yeah, it's worth mentioning"
10-08-2019T23:15:32,AspiringNoodle,Apparently my shift lasting this late was because of the new manager
10-08-2019T23:15:43,AspiringNoodle,The shifts I were quoted by the last manager are the standard
10-08-2019T23:15:59,AspiringNoodle,The new guy has shifted everything an hour later and eliminated some of the overlap
10-08-2019T23:16:17,AspiringNoodle,But the overlaps exist due to lack of customers
10-08-2019T23:22:53,AspiringNoodle,...Do my eyes deceive me or did I see a Snasitin sketch?
10-08-2019T23:24:58,Ordithus,Fluffy Keiths

10-08-2019T23:40:03,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve never been interested a lick in minecraft till Se√°n played it
10-08-2019T23:40:49,SpazztasticKiwi,"while I‚Äôd still not likely play it, watching him play ‚Äúwhat does this do‚Äù is strangely entertaining"
10-08-2019T23:45:09,SomeNiceUser,"The only time I played minecraft, is when my friend group is on and ready to let loose on the chaos."
10-08-2019T23:45:22,SomeNiceUser,It was very fun.
10-08-2019T23:49:15,SomeNiceUser,"The netherworld was the stuff of true fear. Too many high places, lava at the worst of locations, plus the Ghasts... Too many resources loss in fruitless expeditions."
10-08-2019T23:52:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I just hope Se√°n doesn‚Äôt decide to try seeking out the dragon just for funsies
10-08-2019T23:52:36,SpazztasticKiwi,it won‚Äôt end well
10-08-2019T23:53:17,SpazztasticKiwi,right now he‚Äôs focused on collecting all the animals as pets
10-08-2019T23:53:38,Ordithus,Heartwarming minecraft
10-08-2019T23:53:55,SpazztasticKiwi,the ghasts remind me of that fluffy thing in horten hears a who that goes ‚Äúhaaaaaa‚Äù
10-08-2019T23:54:50,SpazztasticKiwi,he‚Äôs got a dog - now he‚Äôs trying to get a fox after having a fit seeing a bunny and cats
10-08-2019T23:55:07,SpazztasticKiwi,wants a cat too but he‚Äôs yet to figure out how to tame one
10-08-2019T23:55:21,Ordithus,I want to befriend the foxes in breath of the wild
10-08-2019T23:56:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm waiting for Se√°n to try a game with Felix and Mark
10-08-2019T23:56:27,SpazztasticKiwi,gonna be the blind following the skilled but still clueless following the skilled
10-08-2019T23:56:30,Ordithus,But Mark wasn't going to play! :P
10-08-2019T23:56:37,SpazztasticKiwi,give him time
10-08-2019T23:56:57,SpazztasticKiwi,"if he put a video out like that, it‚Äôs coming"
10-08-2019T23:57:27,Ordithus,No way
10-08-2019T23:57:56,SpazztasticKiwi,just this time no one ask the colorblind one to look for the weird colored stuff
