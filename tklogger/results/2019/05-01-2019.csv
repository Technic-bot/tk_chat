05-01-2019T14:25:52,CrimsonQuill,"Mostly from the literary perspective, but films as well."
05-01-2019T14:26:10,CrimsonQuill,We watched it together one evening...and everyone was laughing.

05-01-2019T14:27:46,CrimsonQuill,Good point.
05-01-2019T14:28:35,Mippy,It breaks me out of the story when people are constantly talking or adding unnessisay comentary

05-01-2019T15:39:58,CrimsonQuill,It's just that I struggle at it.
05-01-2019T15:40:07,Combak,We need a basis for that scale Quill.
05-01-2019T15:40:16,CrimsonQuill,But Partial Differentiation gives me a warm feeling inside when done right.
05-01-2019T15:40:30,CrimsonQuill,"Okay, Combak, consider it a scale of 1-10."

05-01-2019T15:41:13,Combak,You need someTHING to compare it to.

05-01-2019T19:08:34,ThingsAreMoving,"sometimes it's thematic, like during christmas"
05-01-2019T19:08:38,CrRAR,It’s a dank mix
05-01-2019T19:08:48,Bgrmystr2,yeah there was a christmas mix
05-01-2019T19:09:00,Bgrmystr2,and there was one time he had the SimCity 3000 soundtrack
05-01-2019T19:09:01,CatzArt,I can only imagine that the transfer from quadrapedal keidarian form to bipedal form is a odd time
05-01-2019T19:09:08,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Erics glasses make everything look hyper realistic
05-01-2019T19:09:17,Bgrmystr2,but what he's playing now is the same every time.
05-01-2019T19:09:23,Bgrmystr2,it's randomized playback
05-01-2019T19:09:28,LoneWolfZitsue,I want Trace to have a girl
05-01-2019T19:09:34,CrossbreedArts,Doing her hair in a pony tail like Eric normality has is a cute touch

05-01-2019T19:09:43,ThingsAreMoving,Trace has Flora

05-01-2019T19:11:05,CrRAR,What a scamp
05-01-2019T19:11:08,LoneWolfZitsue,We all know  that Tra ce is actually a keidarian

05-01-2019T19:11:23,LoneWolfZitsue,Trace*

05-01-2019T19:12:15,LoneWolfZitsue,Who also thinks that Trace is a keidarian
05-01-2019T19:12:19,ThingsAreMoving,3g should be enough to watch the stream. The quality should adjust
05-01-2019T19:12:32,CatzArt,we have tiger trace Zitzue
05-01-2019T19:12:49,LoneWolfZitsue,Yea and tigers are keidarian
05-01-2019T19:13:10,ThingsAreMoving,keidran*
05-01-2019T19:13:17,Katfeathers,management says the wi fi is being worked on but thats been since day before Christmas
05-01-2019T19:13:32,CatzArt,trace could use the collar of Keidranification
05-01-2019T19:13:42,LoneWolfZitsue,"So do u think in the storyline, that Trace is really a keidran"
05-01-2019T19:13:48,CatzArt,no
05-01-2019T19:13:52,ThingsAreMoving,Not likely
05-01-2019T19:14:06,LoneWolfZitsue,I think so
05-01-2019T19:14:14,IceMagic,"It could be a thing, but odds are it's not"
05-01-2019T19:14:17,BadFoMo,I don't think so.
05-01-2019T19:14:21,Bgrmystr2,"The story says he's human, I dunno how you can think something like that."
05-01-2019T19:14:23,LoneWolfZitsue,I mean his human parents could be a lie
05-01-2019T19:14:37,KiTA,"nah, too much of a twist"
05-01-2019T19:14:43,CatzArt,To each his own I suppose. Then I vote for Basitan Trace
05-01-2019T19:14:46,Bgrmystr2,"that's not really how stories work either, lol"
05-01-2019T19:15:25,LoneWolfZitsue,"U never know, the point of story’s is to think ahead and think of all the outcomes (well sometimes)"
05-01-2019T19:15:42,Bgrmystr2,do you.. read stories?
05-01-2019T19:15:44,Bgrmystr2,xD
05-01-2019T19:15:47,Bgrmystr2,"like, at all"
05-01-2019T19:15:52,CatzArt,Heh. I saw KiTA's username and in my head saw Krita and wondered why someone would name themselves after a digital art program.
05-01-2019T19:16:04,LoneWolfZitsue,I meant like comics and stories stuff like that
05-01-2019T19:16:11,KiTA,haha
05-01-2019T19:16:30,ThingsAreMoving,"When you establish an origin story you usually stick to it, not change it with some plot twists"
05-01-2019T19:16:41,LoneWolfZitsue,True
05-01-2019T19:16:43,Bgrmystr2,plot twists don't usually change the story itself
05-01-2019T19:16:46,Bgrmystr2,that's not how they work
05-01-2019T19:16:50,LoneWolfZitsue,I’m thinking way too much
05-01-2019T19:17:05,CrRAR,Lol the mom
05-01-2019T19:17:08,Bgrmystr2,"the story will generally say something JUST SHORT of the plot twist, or explain in detail via how characters see it."
05-01-2019T19:17:19,Bgrmystr2,it won't tell the viewer falsehoods
05-01-2019T19:17:21,LoneWolfZitsue,I guess
05-01-2019T19:17:21,THETOXICATOR,I'm silent
05-01-2019T19:17:23,Daltheer,"to be fair there are outliers to these things, like KOTOR 1, but that heavily hinted its twist throughout the game"
05-01-2019T19:17:49,CatzArt,Or BGR you can do my favorite thing to establish characters...WORLDBUILD.

05-01-2019T19:21:11,unsteddyphoenix,its true

05-01-2019T19:28:58,Mandag,Good Berserk anime W H E N?
05-01-2019T19:29:08,ThingsAreMoving,Never ever
05-01-2019T19:29:12,Daltheer,when the manga is done
05-01-2019T19:29:14,CatzArt,No mandag go watch the origional

05-01-2019T19:29:30,Sammit,"I read the one punch man manga and liked it, i hope next season of the anime do justice to it"
05-01-2019T19:29:32,CatzArt,or watch Goblin Slayer. that was a good anime
05-01-2019T19:29:41,MarvTheHugPharaoh,No it was not
05-01-2019T19:29:43,Mandag,The original is okay... but kinda looks like a powerpoint presentation... A very pretty powerpoint.
05-01-2019T19:29:49,ThingsAreMoving,Goblin slayer is... not bad
05-01-2019T19:29:50,Mandag,Goblin slayer is kinda shit
05-01-2019T19:29:50,ThingsAreMoving,tbh
05-01-2019T19:29:52,ShadowSoap,Do you guys watch Abridged versions on YouTube?

05-01-2019T19:30:04,Mandag,At least when you compare it to the manga
05-01-2019T19:30:09,CatzArt,yes it was Marv minus that bit in the first episode
05-01-2019T19:30:21,MarvTheHugPharaoh,All Goblin slayer is just edgy boy the anime
05-01-2019T19:30:27,Mandag,"Are you talking about the rape, Catz?"
05-01-2019T19:30:33,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Its basically a r rated sword art online ]
05-01-2019T19:30:41,Xexanoth,"to be fair, most stuff is shit compared to the manga"
05-01-2019T19:30:41,unsteddyphoenix,Nah it was fine
05-01-2019T19:30:42,CrimsonHelsing,"Kei, don't - blink!"
05-01-2019T19:30:50,Xexanoth,altough there are some weird exceptions
05-01-2019T19:30:54,Xexanoth,like hero academy
05-01-2019T19:30:58,Mandag,"Goblin Slayer isn't even that edgy, just kinda bland after roughly three or four episodes."
05-01-2019T19:30:59,CatzArt,yes mandag that. the light novel of Goblin slayer is much better.
05-01-2019T19:31:00,unsteddyphoenix,First episode was maximum edge but the rest was toned down
05-01-2019T19:31:09,BadFoMo,Doctor Who

05-01-2019T19:31:32,unsteddyphoenix,I liked the message behind goblin slayer. Waay better than SAO
05-01-2019T19:31:40,Mandag,There's a message?
05-01-2019T19:31:45,MarvTheHugPharaoh,kill goblins
05-01-2019T19:31:49,Mandag,Oh
05-01-2019T19:31:55,Mandag,Sounds like a good message
05-01-2019T19:31:56,ThingsAreMoving,Go watch elfen lied
05-01-2019T19:32:05,MarvTheHugPharaoh,go watch monster
05-01-2019T19:32:07,RimaDraws,omg
05-01-2019T19:32:10,ShadowSoap,o-o
05-01-2019T19:32:11,Xexanoth,"to be fair, SAO was a generic shounen that got big for no reason...."
05-01-2019T19:32:17,Tharkis,go watch tokyo mew mew !
05-01-2019T19:32:29,unsteddyphoenix,Monster is hella good
05-01-2019T19:32:35,Mandag,I would sell my soul for an OVA of Lost Children arc of Berserk
05-01-2019T19:32:38,unsteddyphoenix,If you can read go read 20th century boys
05-01-2019T19:33:02,Tharkis,"i'm going to be going to japan for my first time this year, and i'm nervous about it ._<"
05-01-2019T19:33:04,Tharkis,>_<
05-01-2019T19:33:05,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I would like to see the castlevania anime team try berserk
05-01-2019T19:33:13,Bgrmystr2,"oo that sounds fun, Thark"
05-01-2019T19:33:14,CatzArt,ah we havent seen that character in a while. No Goblin slayer is a play on Dungeons and dragons. essentially when you play D&D you wanna go on an adventure and fight monsters. Gob Slayer is only concerned with killing goblins above all else which..
05-01-2019T19:33:17,CrimsonHelsing,"Very much so a doctor Who reference, badfo"
05-01-2019T19:33:20,ThingsAreMoving,First castlevvania was ok
05-01-2019T19:33:22,CatzArt,are the lowest level monsters
05-01-2019T19:33:29,ThingsAreMoving,but second season was too... netflix-y
05-01-2019T19:33:44,ThingsAreMoving,unnecesarily spread out
05-01-2019T19:34:03,MarvTheHugPharaoh,still would be better then the ps1 cutscene we got
05-01-2019T19:34:10,Mandag,"Goblin Slayer is good for gratuitous murder-boners, as well as a bit of cute character interaction"
05-01-2019T19:34:21,Mandag,Lizard-lad is pretty great
05-01-2019T19:34:22,unsteddyphoenix,"The goblins represent the smaller more insidious problems in society that are annoying and difficult to deal with, and therefore ignored"
05-01-2019T19:34:54,unsteddyphoenix,"The ""big issues"" like the world ending monster dies in like episode 6 or some shit."
05-01-2019T19:35:02,Mandag,Pretty sure I've read the director of Castlevania saying he'd be interested in a Berserk adaption
05-01-2019T19:35:05,CatzArt,Indeed it is Mandag and phoenix. GS is essentially all about a goblin exterminator
05-01-2019T19:35:07,MarvTheHugPharaoh,he did
05-01-2019T19:35:24,Mandag,After he's done with Devil May Cry maybe.
05-01-2019T19:35:32,CatzArt,On a different tangent. Did anyone here also watch Hellsing Ultimate?
05-01-2019T19:35:35,MarvTheHugPharaoh,fucking finally

05-01-2019T20:33:02,Bgrmystr2,not far as I can tell.
05-01-2019T20:33:26,Kinipshun,"well, over the course of like a year, but yeah hes done it several times out of that"
05-01-2019T20:33:26,Bgrmystr2,"It's basically never on the end of the song. Always in the middle, or in the beginning for me."
05-01-2019T20:33:54,SpazztasticKiwi,...never looked to see how my idea did
05-01-2019T20:33:55,Kinipshun,btw thatnks tom! excellent work

05-01-2019T20:37:53,RimaDraws,oh boy so i gotta find a way to study spanish in one week
05-01-2019T20:38:55,SpazztasticKiwi,We used vocabulary charts in hs
05-01-2019T20:39:01,Bgrmystr2,you gonna learn the whole language in a week?
05-01-2019T20:39:04,Bgrmystr2,good fucking luck xD
05-01-2019T20:39:09,Combak,"Hey all, back home."
05-01-2019T20:39:15,RimaDraws,i got an A in that class

05-01-2019T20:39:28,Combak,And I missed the end. XD
05-01-2019T20:39:33,Bgrmystr2,yes you did combak
05-01-2019T20:39:37,ProsePro7,So did I
05-01-2019T20:39:41,Bgrmystr2,"Don't worry, there's a recording"
05-01-2019T20:39:44,Bgrmystr2,you can go back and view it
05-01-2019T20:39:46,RimaDraws,i pick up on spanish pretty quick
05-01-2019T20:40:18,MviluUatusun,Y'all take care until next time.
05-01-2019T20:40:23,RimaDraws,i will
05-01-2019T20:40:25,Combak,Bye Mvilu!
05-01-2019T20:40:26,RimaDraws,you too
05-01-2019T20:54:29,SpazztasticKiwi,I find it a lil surprising how much Spanish I know when I hear it
05-01-2019T20:54:53,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s like I actually managed to learn something
05-01-2019T20:55:47,Bgrmystr2,leaning through real scenarios is the best way to learn.
05-01-2019T20:56:10,Bgrmystr2,"like being able to have a bowl of soup or whatnot in front of you, and learning what the word for that would be"
05-01-2019T20:56:15,unsteddyphoenix,Its true. Living in the country of the language youre learning helps tremendously
05-01-2019T20:56:35,Bgrmystr2,"it's by far the best way for your body to remember, because that's exactly how kids learn language"
05-01-2019T20:56:52,Bgrmystr2,they learn by connecting a word with an object of some type
05-01-2019T20:59:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Soup? I can tell you what that is in German but not Spanish
05-01-2019T21:01:03,Bgrmystr2,"well, it's just an example, but yeah"
05-01-2019T21:01:05,Bgrmystr2,that kinda stuff
05-01-2019T21:02:00,Bgrmystr2,"when you're actually in the country, you'll hear and see the words in action repetitively."
05-01-2019T21:02:23,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-awoo:
05-01-2019T21:02:26,Bgrmystr2,it's a great learning tool just to be there to see it
05-01-2019T21:02:30,Bgrmystr2,heya tom
05-01-2019T21:02:39,unsteddyphoenix,"Exactly, live with wolves learn to awoo"
05-01-2019T21:02:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Ok Tom wants to announce his presence
05-01-2019T21:02:51,Bgrmystr2,what phoenix said xD
05-01-2019T21:03:16,SpazztasticKiwi,I have no desire to move to Germany to become one with the language atm
05-01-2019T21:03:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Or Spain or Mexico
05-01-2019T21:04:05,Bgrmystr2,"well, the US has PLENTY of places where people speak different languages"
05-01-2019T21:04:25,Bgrmystr2,kinda like how you see a lot of chinese-speakers in a true and proper chinatown
05-01-2019T21:04:42,Bgrmystr2,you'll see that with other countries too
05-01-2019T21:04:52,Bgrmystr2,but you'd need to find one xD
05-01-2019T21:04:55,SpazztasticKiwi,We have a bit of spanish descent in Alabama being so close to Mexico
05-01-2019T21:05:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Including the guy who asked if I was married when he learned I can speak and understand it some
05-01-2019T21:05:42,Bgrmystr2,"Here in Orleans, I think there's a few places where you can find people speaking french"
05-01-2019T21:07:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Only reasons I picked German was it’s a scary language and I’ve been told I have German in me - and possible family in Germany
05-01-2019T21:08:52,Bgrmystr2,"I'm part German, but that doesn't make me want to learn the language lol"
05-01-2019T21:10:31,SpazztasticKiwi,"Better point is, why not? Might be able to find a German youtuber that I like after"
05-01-2019T21:14:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Or show. Try some books
05-01-2019T21:14:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Who knows
05-01-2019T21:15:19,Bgrmystr2,"honestly, that's a MASSIVE time investment and money sink for a ""what if"""
05-01-2019T21:15:59,Bgrmystr2,"Some are worth, but naw, big pass for me"
05-01-2019T21:16:24,Bgrmystr2,I'd learn Japanese as a second language though. Lots of shows and books I read are in said language so I have a vested interest
05-01-2019T21:16:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve only been doin 5 minutes a day for 237 days. And the app’s free
05-01-2019T21:16:48,Xexanoth,pretty much the only reason to learn german would be to actually make piranha bytes game enjoyable....
05-01-2019T21:16:53,Xexanoth,*games
05-01-2019T21:16:55,Bgrmystr2,"I don't have a phone with apps, and wouldn't be able to pay for it anyway :P"
05-01-2019T21:17:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Free
05-01-2019T21:17:20,Bgrmystr2,phones are not free
05-01-2019T21:17:24,Bgrmystr2,nor is internet
05-01-2019T21:18:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Doesn’t require internet for practice unless you’re in a group
05-01-2019T21:18:56,Bgrmystr2,still need it to get the app though
05-01-2019T21:19:10,RimaDraws,ooooh boy
05-01-2019T21:19:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Wifi
05-01-2019T21:19:15,RimaDraws,i almost had a fit
05-01-2019T21:19:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Computer 💥
05-01-2019T21:19:57,RimaDraws,im ok now
05-01-2019T21:20:24,Bgrmystr2,"either way, I'd still have to pay for both to use it"
05-01-2019T21:46:13,Dadrobit,Howdy y'all.
05-01-2019T21:46:21,Dadrobit,Stream go well?

05-01-2019T21:49:32,Dadrobit,Doin' good. Trying to get back into the swing of things.
05-01-2019T21:51:53,RimaDraws,same. i got school starting next week
05-01-2019T21:52:27,RimaDraws,i figured if i can get a solid A in these two classes my gpa should go from 3.085 to 3.543
05-01-2019T21:52:43,RimaDraws,if i get solid As in Spanish 2 and geology class
05-01-2019T21:53:19,RimaDraws,i really hope that is the case.
05-01-2019T21:54:53,Dadrobit,Good luck!
05-01-2019T21:55:10,Dadrobit,I kinda wish I could go back to school and keep on learning stuffs.
05-01-2019T21:55:32,Dadrobit,"But I gotta actually, ya know. Work now."
05-01-2019T21:55:59,RimaDraws,im doing that too. two jobs
05-01-2019T21:56:03,Dadrobit,Which I don't mind mind you.
05-01-2019T21:56:29,Dadrobit,"Yeah, been considering picking up a job as an engineer at a local studio recently."
05-01-2019T21:56:51,RimaDraws,well i do my art on the side
05-01-2019T21:56:54,RimaDraws,plus jack daniels
05-01-2019T21:57:22,Dadrobit,"Yeah, that'd be thing thing. VA would become the side gig."
05-01-2019T21:57:51,RimaDraws,niiice
05-01-2019T21:59:29,Dadrobit,":/ kinda. I wouldn't mind working as an engineer, s'pecially if I got to work in post-production. But I really want to make VA work as it is."
05-01-2019T22:00:39,RimaDraws,voice acting is fun
05-01-2019T22:00:50,RimaDraws,gotta take care of those vocal cords tho
05-01-2019T22:01:10,Dadrobit,It is. When you get paid.
05-01-2019T22:02:04,Dadrobit,"Best quote I got from someone in the industry was something along the lines of, ""voice acting isn't 'work for pay'. It's 'work for work that pays'."""
05-01-2019T22:02:38,Dadrobit,It's fuckin' truuuuuuuu
05-01-2019T22:02:51,RimaDraws,i know
05-01-2019T22:04:53,Bgrmystr2,..what's the difference?
05-01-2019T22:06:58,Dadrobit,"90% of my job is auditions. It doesn't pay to audition, but it still requires the same amount of work to do."
05-01-2019T22:07:09,Dadrobit,90%+* honestly.
05-01-2019T22:17:06,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-wondering:

05-01-2019T23:35:19,Dadrobit,"Fun fact of the day. That sound was originally just a ""filler"" sound for the beta until a more permanant one was produced. The community loved it so much it became the official one. It was created by one of the devs. It is the sound of them gargling yogur"
05-01-2019T23:35:29,Dadrobit,yogurt*
