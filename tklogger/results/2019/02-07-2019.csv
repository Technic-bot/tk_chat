02-07-2019T00:48:39,CrimsonQuill,Good morning.
02-07-2019T01:42:57,BadFoMo,Dang!
02-07-2019T01:43:23,BadFoMo,"...Also, good morning."
02-07-2019T01:46:27,CrimsonQuill,Hullo FoMo
02-07-2019T01:46:57,CrimsonQuill,@Dadrobit How long had the man been missing?
02-07-2019T01:57:06,Dadrobit,We got the missing persons notice yesterday.
02-07-2019T02:01:58,CrimsonQuill,Oh
02-07-2019T02:02:11,CrimsonQuill,And you said that the animals got to him first...
02-07-2019T02:02:14,CrimsonQuill,Good grief.
02-07-2019T03:17:46,Dadrobit,"Yeah, it's a desert, coyotes, bobcats, and mountain lions yo. Shit's dangerous sometimes."
02-07-2019T03:19:00,CrimsonQuill,Ooof.
02-07-2019T03:19:13,CrimsonQuill,Anyone you knew?
02-07-2019T03:26:28,Dadrobit,"Naw, no one I was particularly close with. Knew the name, had met them once or twice, but they were mostly just another face."
02-07-2019T03:54:07,AspiringNoodle,I am back... I am not taking a nap today.  If I get tired: video games will happen :ptv-unimpressed:
02-07-2019T03:54:28,AspiringNoodle,And I read about the missing person :ptv-sad:
02-07-2019T04:12:28,CrimsonQuill,:ptv-sad: Yes...it's heavy/
02-07-2019T04:23:04,AspiringNoodle,...Newegg's been stupid slow for me recently.  I wonder what's up
02-07-2019T04:23:33,AspiringNoodle,I'll get a pretty big laugh if it's related to the iGPU.  That just screams lack of optimization xD
02-07-2019T05:28:04,AspiringNoodle,DAYUM
02-07-2019T05:28:12,AspiringNoodle,Chat be ded

02-07-2019T06:54:02,AspiringNoodle,I'm trying to wrap my head around this...
02-07-2019T06:54:33,AspiringNoodle,"On Newegg, Corsair has 2 versions of their LL120 fans.  Black and White.  For some reason, black is designed for noise, and white for performance."
02-07-2019T06:54:46,AspiringNoodle,Like... why doesn't black have performance fans???
02-07-2019T07:08:03,TerraTheWizard,because the like to mess with you :ctwokinds-smug:
02-07-2019T07:08:14,TerraTheWizard,*they
02-07-2019T07:11:03,AspiringNoodle,When in doubt: Gamers Nexus xD
02-07-2019T07:11:32,AspiringNoodle,Gonna check out how much of an impact low-noise vs high-performance fans makes when it comes to thermals

02-07-2019T07:49:59,iliar,Hi
02-07-2019T07:50:09,iliar,I hate picarto
02-07-2019T07:50:36,iliar,I fixed bot... for a while...
02-07-2019T07:50:45,CrimsonQuill,That's good.
02-07-2019T07:53:39,AspiringNoodle,*inb4 new update 1 week later*
02-07-2019T07:53:47,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-kippi2:
02-07-2019T08:02:41,iliar,Picarto documentation is awful. I could not find answers to many questions. And so my code looks something like this https://www.monkeyuser.com/2018/production-ready/?sc=true&dir=previous
02-07-2019T08:06:02,iliar,I feel it will break soon. But I do not know when this will happen.
02-07-2019T08:06:18,CrimsonQuill,Jeepers
02-07-2019T08:07:21,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-nibspartyhard:
02-07-2019T08:11:53,AspiringNoodle,3
02-07-2019T08:22:24,AspiringNoodle,"Dang, thought someone would respond xD"
02-07-2019T08:33:37,AspiringNoodle,"Ever since getting a smart phone, I've been getting infrequent calls from random numbers :/"
02-07-2019T08:33:49,CrimsonQuill,:3
02-07-2019T08:33:55,AspiringNoodle,"Part of me thinks: ""Robocallers are morons... they're going to kill their own industry at some point"""
02-07-2019T08:34:15,AspiringNoodle,"I mean, American culture in particular is shifting towards ""If I don't recognize the number, f*ck you"""
02-07-2019T08:41:10,AspiringNoodle,You guys should watch Mark's QT video.
02-07-2019T08:41:27,AspiringNoodle,"It's a spoof of PT, from the looks of it.  But with adorable scribbles everywhere"
02-07-2019T08:41:36,AspiringNoodle,Even the crosshair is a tiny smile >w<
02-07-2019T08:42:02,CrimsonQuill,I watched it
02-07-2019T08:42:04,CrimsonQuill,It was weird
02-07-2019T08:42:07,CrimsonQuill,But cute
02-07-2019T08:46:48,AspiringNoodle,Lol... there was a hair on my monitor
02-07-2019T08:47:11,AspiringNoodle,Felt like I was going to destroy the screen before I managed to blow it off xD
02-07-2019T09:14:26,CrimsonQuill,Time to make...
02-07-2019T09:14:28,CrimsonQuill,SPAGHETTI

02-07-2019T12:00:11,CrimsonQuill,Maren will make him floofy-Floof the fur! For Power!
02-07-2019T12:01:05,IronHorseComics,"""Ahhhh my fur no longer itches"""
02-07-2019T12:01:33,IronHorseComics,"seriously, loose fur like that's gotta be really itchy"
02-07-2019T12:01:40,CrimsonQuill,Probably
02-07-2019T12:01:49,CrimsonQuill,"I mean, loose hair is itchy on it's own."
02-07-2019T12:01:49,IronHorseComics,and what if a Keidren was allergic to himself?
02-07-2019T12:01:55,CrimsonQuill,"Nah, impossible."
02-07-2019T12:11:26,IronHorseComics,what if a keidran was allergic to humans
02-07-2019T12:11:31,IronHorseComics,unlikely but still
02-07-2019T12:11:39,CrimsonQuill,Hpe not
02-07-2019T12:12:06,IronHorseComics,that would actually be a funny sketch idea
02-07-2019T12:12:08,TerraTheWizard,monkey's paw
02-07-2019T12:12:20,TerraTheWizard,"""i wish my husband wasn't allergic to the cat"""
02-07-2019T12:12:34,TerraTheWizard,"granted, but your cat is now allergic to your husband"
02-07-2019T12:15:36,IronHorseComics,"""the sneezing from your cat will be adorable"""
02-07-2019T12:18:49,iliar,"Allergy is a hypersensitivity of the immune system on foreign things. The immune system always distinguishes its things from foreign. If this system breaks down, then much bigger problems await you than just an allergy."
02-07-2019T12:20:09,IronHorseComics,I used to be allergic to eggs as a child
02-07-2019T12:20:26,iliar,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmune_disease
02-07-2019T12:42:22,IronHorseComics,"ah, there we go, now I have visible token to tell whether the mic is on of off for Friday"

02-07-2019T15:13:40,IronHorseComics,and that's my Independence Day art finished
02-07-2019T15:18:48,TerraTheWizard,"oh right, tomorrow is traitor day :ctwokinds-smug:"
02-07-2019T15:19:47,IronHorseComics,"well, next time, give some representation with taxation, lol"

02-07-2019T15:33:26,CrimsonQuill,night night alll
02-07-2019T15:34:25,IronHorseComics,night
02-07-2019T15:36:05,TerraTheWizard,o/
02-07-2019T16:23:30,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-nibsdance:
02-07-2019T16:44:56,IronHorseComics,now I am to consume chickens
02-07-2019T16:45:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Mark slowly going insane playing Mario Maker is sorely entertaining
02-07-2019T16:46:42,AspiringNoodle,"I have mixed feelings about Mark, tbh"
02-07-2019T16:46:51,IronHorseComics,this is why I avoid rage games like the cancer that they are
02-07-2019T16:47:09,AspiringNoodle,There are times where his reactions are genuine
02-07-2019T16:47:16,AspiringNoodle,But so many others where they look blatantly forced
02-07-2019T16:56:13,IronHorseComics,probably to keep the videos entertaining for a little while longer
02-07-2019T16:56:23,IronHorseComics,I've done that when I did let's plays
02-07-2019T17:01:25,AspiringNoodle,I remember when I dug into the LP Curse
02-07-2019T17:01:49,AspiringNoodle,"Apparently Arin from the Game Grumps is the poster child for that, as well as ""dumb LP syndrome"" :P"
02-07-2019T17:04:34,IronHorseComics,Mine were just fake and bad jokes
02-07-2019T17:04:41,IronHorseComics,I had no clue what I was doing
02-07-2019T17:06:35,AspiringNoodle,"I would probably be a bunch of acting like an idiot, dad jokes, and self-deprecating humor"
02-07-2019T17:07:22,IronHorseComics,nowadays I'd probably be on the witty side
02-07-2019T17:07:40,IronHorseComics,with clever dialogue
02-07-2019T17:08:06,AspiringNoodle,*agh*
02-07-2019T17:08:18,AspiringNoodle,Newegg being slower than molasses is so irritating...
02-07-2019T17:08:29,IronHorseComics,indeed
02-07-2019T17:11:35,AspiringNoodle,*facepalm*
02-07-2019T17:11:41,AspiringNoodle,Corsair so close to what I want...
02-07-2019T17:11:58,AspiringNoodle,Found a case that includes 3 LL120 fans with lighting node pro
02-07-2019T17:12:05,AspiringNoodle,But it's a cube case...
02-07-2019T17:12:41,IronHorseComics,why? Why are cube cases a thing?
02-07-2019T17:14:22,AspiringNoodle,Part of it is probably cable management
02-07-2019T17:14:29,AspiringNoodle,You can have all the power goodies out front
02-07-2019T17:14:43,AspiringNoodle,Meanwhile the back has the essential stuff like power supply and all non-m.2 storage
02-07-2019T17:15:26,IronHorseComics,I see. I still prefer regular towers
02-07-2019T17:15:58,AspiringNoodle,Same
02-07-2019T17:16:21,AspiringNoodle,I think the size tower I want is largest mid-tower / smallest full-tower
02-07-2019T17:20:16,AspiringNoodle,I got a link for a marketing fail for you to look at xD
02-07-2019T17:20:52,AspiringNoodle,Reference images for the actual product: SP 120 RGB fans
02-07-2019T17:21:15,AspiringNoodle,"Images in the overview / marketing pitch, LL 120s :ptv-laugh:"
02-07-2019T17:21:57,AspiringNoodle,"It's like... if you're gonna make a sales pitch for the case using LL 120s, include LL 120s with the damn case :ptv-unimpressed:"
02-07-2019T17:22:22,IronHorseComics,that doesn't look too far off from a case I recently purchased for when I upgraded my PC
02-07-2019T17:23:07,IronHorseComics,however it doesn't have
02-07-2019T17:23:32,IronHorseComics,"the hexagonal grid in front of the fans, is black"
02-07-2019T17:25:47,AspiringNoodle,I want to run all LL 120s from Corsair in the upcoming build
02-07-2019T17:26:06,AspiringNoodle,"So ideally, I'd get a corsair case that already has some of the fans I plan to use, or a case with no fans at all."
02-07-2019T17:26:46,AspiringNoodle,"Normal people don't care that much, I'm like, ""ALL FANS MUST BE THE SAME, NO EXCEPTIONS"""
02-07-2019T17:30:24,IronHorseComics,"I only got a new case because my new graphics car wouldn't fit in the old one, the one I have now is smaller overall but it has more space on the inside, my old case was built before the giant bricks of graphics cards were less than $1000"
02-07-2019T17:30:59,IronHorseComics,"like, five to seven years ago"
02-07-2019T17:32:08,AspiringNoodle,I think I might have found my case.
02-07-2019T17:33:39,IronHorseComics,"ooooohhh nice. The reason I went with mine is because I can put my CD rom in it, with VLC media being able to let me play DVDs it became necessary to keep it"
02-07-2019T17:34:16,AspiringNoodle,"Now the big question: Do I go with a 240 aio for the top, or a 360 for the front? xD"
02-07-2019T17:34:43,IronHorseComics,I dunno
02-07-2019T17:35:00,AspiringNoodle,There's arguments for both.  Mainly along the lines of component temperature
02-07-2019T17:35:14,TeapotOfDoom,Lian Li PC-O11 is where it's at
02-07-2019T17:35:20,AspiringNoodle,"Rad on the intake means cooler CPU temps but your GPU will suffer, and the opposite is true for rad on the top"
02-07-2019T17:35:21,TeapotOfDoom,Good evening folks
02-07-2019T17:35:33,TeapotOfDoom,I should be in bed and yet i am not
02-07-2019T17:36:14,TeapotOfDoom,I would go for the 360. more cooling capacity is better
02-07-2019T17:36:34,IronHorseComics,plus you should be able to add more fans
02-07-2019T17:36:52,Bgrmystr2,I heard about that Lian pc from a friend
02-07-2019T17:36:55,Bgrmystr2,I'm not sold
02-07-2019T17:36:59,Bgrmystr2,polite pass
02-07-2019T17:36:59,TeapotOfDoom,Also 3 fans on the front mean more flow anyways except if you would have put three in the front anyway
02-07-2019T17:37:01,Bgrmystr2,also gmornin
02-07-2019T17:37:12,TeapotOfDoom,Hi Bgr!
02-07-2019T17:37:12,Bgrmystr2,and it looks fuckin terrible
02-07-2019T17:37:16,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-nibsdance:
02-07-2019T17:37:21,TeapotOfDoom,Hi Terra
02-07-2019T17:37:23,Bgrmystr2,though LOTS of towers look terrible imo
02-07-2019T17:37:27,TeapotOfDoom,Seams like a party in here
02-07-2019T17:37:38,Bgrmystr2,just normal day
02-07-2019T17:37:59,TeapotOfDoom,The case looks pretty weird on its own
02-07-2019T17:37:59,IronHorseComics,no just computer parts talk
02-07-2019T17:38:34,TeapotOfDoom,It's like a rough diamond. If you know what you're doing it can look stunning
02-07-2019T17:39:02,Bgrmystr2,"if it's a cube, I don't want it."
02-07-2019T17:39:09,TeapotOfDoom,Just saw a reddit post today where someone used the white version and did a red hardline tubing run
02-07-2019T17:39:32,Bgrmystr2,"""Look at me and all the *NOTHING* I project, Aren't I boring?"" Yes PC case, that's why I will never buy shit like you."
02-07-2019T17:39:37,TeapotOfDoom,Well it's kinda
02-07-2019T17:39:54,TeapotOfDoom,wait i know something
02-07-2019T17:40:22,TeapotOfDoom,http://cdn.eteknix.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/1Phantom410.jpg
02-07-2019T17:40:31,TeapotOfDoom,yeah good ol times
02-07-2019T17:40:48,Bgrmystr2,yeah that one was nice. It's borderline box though
02-07-2019T17:40:57,Bgrmystr2,I'd still get it
02-07-2019T17:41:06,Bgrmystr2,cuz it's a damn good tower
02-07-2019T17:42:35,TeapotOfDoom,haha i thought about getting that one when i got my own tower back in 2013. wow my pc is old...
02-07-2019T17:43:01,TeapotOfDoom,i had no idea what i was doing back then
02-07-2019T17:43:09,TeapotOfDoom,still using the same hardware tho
02-07-2019T17:46:04,TeapotOfDoom,one case i would love to build in some day would be the define nano s from fractal. I would also mod it with tempered glass. It's just like a shoebox with water cooling support
02-07-2019T17:48:14,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
02-07-2019T17:50:45,AspiringNoodle,That corsair case I'm looking at looks like it'll have decent thermals
02-07-2019T17:51:12,AspiringNoodle,"When gamer's nexus did a review of the case back in it's original format (non-tempered glass front panel, only 2 fans included)"
02-07-2019T17:52:07,AspiringNoodle,"They tested with a 6700k oc'd to 4.4Ghz with an MSI Core Frozr L as the cpu cooler, they were getting temps ~52 - 57C over ambient."
02-07-2019T17:52:58,AspiringNoodle,"A bit toasty, but the case had almost no airflow.  Default was 1 intake 1 exhaust.  The temps dropped to 51 - 52 by either removing the front panel or adding an extra fan."
02-07-2019T17:53:44,AspiringNoodle,"I'm thinking that with 3 intake and 3 exhaust, the thermals should be so much better."
02-07-2019T17:56:48,TeapotOfDoom,Why did i read this in Steve's voice
02-07-2019T17:57:58,AspiringNoodle,...Probably because I'm more like Steve than I'll probably ever admit ._.
02-07-2019T17:58:10,TeapotOfDoom,Maybe you are him
02-07-2019T17:58:16,AspiringNoodle,HA
02-07-2019T17:58:19,AspiringNoodle,I wish :p
02-07-2019T17:58:22,TeapotOfDoom,Hahaha
02-07-2019T17:58:50,TeapotOfDoom,Reminds me: Most hillarious thing was Steve trying to speak German in Der8auer's video at computex
02-07-2019T17:59:08,TeapotOfDoom,First thing he does is try to order a beer
02-07-2019T17:59:16,TeapotOfDoom,Nice
02-07-2019T17:59:54,TeapotOfDoom,What's also funny is that Der8auer literally means the peasant in english
02-07-2019T18:00:12,TeapotOfDoom,Anyway I'm off to bed too. Night y'all
02-07-2019T18:01:41,AspiringNoodle,Am I the only one who hates deceptive marketing?
02-07-2019T18:02:12,AspiringNoodle,"I am getting tired of all the marketing photos for parts like AIO coolers, and they hide or edit out the cables that make the damn thing work :ptv-unimpressed:"
02-07-2019T18:02:52,TeapotOfDoom,Gotta make the thing look good
02-07-2019T18:03:29,AspiringNoodle,Not like it matters xD
02-07-2019T18:03:49,AspiringNoodle,I'll probably end up hiding the connectors for the cooler and having all fans hooked up to a hub
02-07-2019T19:50:11,Twokinds,Last day until Anthrocon
02-07-2019T19:50:39,Bgrmystr2,lol you been preparing I'm guessin?
02-07-2019T19:50:46,Bgrmystr2,missed all my bday stuff yesterday lol
02-07-2019T19:50:51,Bgrmystr2,"I'm what, old as you now?"
02-07-2019T19:51:06,Bgrmystr2,for the month.
02-07-2019T19:59:45,Dadrobit,Good luck
02-07-2019T20:02:30,Dadrobit,"So I'm taking a crash journalism college course this month and my first assignment is for me to write a researched piece on a controversial topic, I asked my folks for ideas and these are their answers."
02-07-2019T20:02:54,Dadrobit,Mom: Maybe write about how internet service providers are overcharging and underdelivering on their services?
02-07-2019T20:03:09,Dadrobit,Dad: Are dolphins people? Should they get people rights?
02-07-2019T20:03:42,Dadrobit,10/10 topics all 'round.
02-07-2019T20:06:48,AspiringNoodle,"For the love of god, do the ISP one!"
02-07-2019T20:07:17,AspiringNoodle,Fun fact:  Some ISPs lobbied hard and got laws written on the books that prevent anyone but them from creating infrastructure :)
02-07-2019T20:07:46,AspiringNoodle,"I give it a ""Corruption doesn't exist"" / 10"
02-07-2019T20:17:11,IronHorseComics,stupid caps lock *walks in* what did I miss?
02-07-2019T20:17:18,IronHorseComics,I went AFK for a wee bit
02-07-2019T20:20:53,IronHorseComics,"here's a topic for you DadRobit, ""Why all of the Disney live action remakes are terrible and why they need to be stopped at all costs"""
02-07-2019T20:21:17,IronHorseComics,"well okay not ALL of them are, Pete's Dragon was good"
02-07-2019T20:25:54,SpazztasticKiwi,TOM
02-07-2019T20:25:56,SpazztasticKiwi,sup
02-07-2019T20:27:33,Dadrobit,"Excluding Emma Watson's singing disorder, The Beauty and the Beast was pretty solid imo."
02-07-2019T20:28:57,IronHorseComics,"my point still stands, the remakes must end"
02-07-2019T20:29:36,SpazztasticKiwi,so I just got home
02-07-2019T20:29:42,SpazztasticKiwi,and there’s a ham bone
02-07-2019T20:29:47,SpazztasticKiwi,in my sink
02-07-2019T20:30:24,IronHorseComics,well that's something you don't see everyday
02-07-2019T20:30:30,Dadrobit,"Screw right off, I personally can't wait for the Huntchback of Notre Dame live action scene where they literally burn down the Notre Dame Cathedral for the Hellfire song."
02-07-2019T20:31:10,SpazztasticKiwi,bad joke but someone’s beat them to that already
02-07-2019T20:31:18,IronHorseComics,too soon bro
02-07-2019T20:31:52,Dadrobit,"No joke tho, that'd be a lit movie."
02-07-2019T20:32:05,SpazztasticKiwi,🥁
02-07-2019T20:33:10,IronHorseComics,"they'll make Frollo sound like Jar Jar Binks, it's like they are deliberately trying to piss on their animated films"
02-07-2019T20:33:37,SpazztasticKiwi,oh by the way I have a lil joke
02-07-2019T20:33:52,SpazztasticKiwi,made myself a new pet. It’s a jar ful of jars
02-07-2019T20:33:56,Dadrobit,Steve Buscemi would make an incredible Frollo.
02-07-2019T20:34:08,SpazztasticKiwi,"I call him jar jar. And when I shake him, jar jar clinks"
02-07-2019T20:34:20,IronHorseComics,"lol, Kiwi"
02-07-2019T20:38:11,Dadrobit,Alan Rickman (rip) would for real have made an incredible Frollo. Literally Professor Snape just burning down half of France over a boner.
02-07-2019T20:39:53,SpazztasticKiwi,and we had another possessed kid at work
02-07-2019T20:40:20,IronHorseComics,you should really hire an exorcist...
02-07-2019T20:40:31,IronHorseComics,you walked right into that one
02-07-2019T21:10:55,IronHorseComics,"And now, I have a good list of sketches for the stream on Friday (my own since Tom's gonna be gone)"
02-07-2019T21:49:12,IronHorseComics,"right, I'm off for bed, night all, good luck at Anthrocon Tom"
02-07-2019T21:52:37,Twokinds,Night!
02-07-2019T21:52:43,Twokinds,I'm off to sleep too
02-07-2019T21:52:45,Twokinds,Long drive
02-07-2019T21:52:51,Bgrmystr2,gnight tom
02-07-2019T21:52:55,Bgrmystr2,have fun at Anthrocon
02-07-2019T21:53:30,iliar,Good night.
02-07-2019T21:54:09,SpazztasticKiwi,DRIVE?
02-07-2019T21:54:23,SpazztasticKiwi,night Tom
02-07-2019T21:54:35,SpazztasticKiwi,but DRIVE?
02-07-2019T21:54:43,Dadrobit,"Have a good one, Tom. Have a safe drive and enjoy the con!"
02-07-2019T22:02:56,SpazztasticKiwi,watch for the chupacabra
02-07-2019T22:03:19,SpazztasticKiwi,yes I know it doesn’t live in that area
02-07-2019T22:12:45,AspiringNoodle,*ultra facepalm*
02-07-2019T22:13:38,AspiringNoodle,"Ever have one of those moments where you watch someone do something, and you think, ""Why did you EVER think that was a good idea?  Or are you so dense / insulated that you truly thought it was a good idea and other people would agree?"""

02-07-2019T22:31:22,Ordithus,Kat spread cheer.  With booty.
02-07-2019T22:31:34,AspiringNoodle,I have conflicting feelings about continuing to follow a channel I've been subbed to for a while now :/
02-07-2019T22:32:16,AspiringNoodle,The video they uploaded today... it's bad
02-07-2019T22:32:22,AspiringNoodle,7.1k - 31k
02-07-2019T22:32:45,Ordithus,"Those numbers are meaningless, but everyone can have an off vid."
02-07-2019T22:32:58,AspiringNoodle,It's a channel about game development
02-07-2019T22:33:18,AspiringNoodle,And they went full pearl-clutching social justice brownie points using the same logic that's been debunked for decades...
02-07-2019T22:33:58,AspiringNoodle,"I won't public link, but I'll gladly whisper if you're interested"
02-07-2019T22:34:16,Ordithus,I believe I am watching itnow
02-07-2019T22:44:34,AspiringNoodle,"Their logic is way too damn similar to ""violent video games cause violence"" that was all the rage in the 90's"
02-07-2019T22:44:47,AspiringNoodle,Yay for out of context statements :D
02-07-2019T22:44:52,Ordithus,woot
02-07-2019T22:51:11,AspiringNoodle,"The negative stigma of ""nazis"" is assigned by historical context.  And that's what's being forced onto the multiplayer aspect."
02-07-2019T22:51:18,AspiringNoodle,2/2. Nailed it.
02-07-2019T22:51:49,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-reniembarrassed:
02-07-2019T23:11:25,AspiringNoodle,"Meanwhile, how many people have complained that they're forced to play nazis / terrorists in video games for the 20+ years it's been a thing?"
02-07-2019T23:11:28,AspiringNoodle,3/3

02-07-2019T23:31:28,Ordithus,COD 1 or 2 had a Russian campaign.  It was pretty eye-opening
02-07-2019T23:31:33,Ordithus,woops
02-07-2019T23:31:36,Ordithus,Now I'm doing it
02-07-2019T23:31:41,AspiringNoodle,The curse of Reni
02-07-2019T23:31:42,AspiringNoodle,:)
02-07-2019T23:32:15,Ordithus,I blame myself :ctwokinds-NoraEyebrows:
02-07-2019T23:32:20,AspiringNoodle,"Speaking of Russians, I loved ""No Russian"" from Modern Warfare <3"
02-07-2019T23:33:07,AspiringNoodle,Really drove home how evil and calculating Vladimir Makarov was
02-07-2019T23:33:30,AspiringNoodle,His checklist for that day was definitely this:
02-07-2019T23:33:33,AspiringNoodle,1) Go to airport
02-07-2019T23:33:43,AspiringNoodle,2) Murder hundreds of civilians and armed responders
02-07-2019T23:33:56,AspiringNoodle,3) Murder the American mole and leave his body at the scene
02-07-2019T23:34:03,AspiringNoodle,4) Wait for war between America and Russia
02-07-2019T23:34:45,Ordithus,I remember that mission causing a lot of controversy.
02-07-2019T23:35:33,Ordithus,"I never played the game, so I don't know how it really goes down"
02-07-2019T23:35:39,Ordithus,How the story treats it
02-07-2019T23:35:57,Ordithus,Or how the player thinks about it
02-07-2019T23:36:23,AspiringNoodle,The mission is more or less you're part of Makarov's group that shows up at a russian airport armed in kevlar vests with LMGs
02-07-2019T23:36:52,AspiringNoodle,"The famous line, ""Remember... no Russian."" is spoken just before opening fire behind a crowd of unwitting civilians"
02-07-2019T23:37:16,AspiringNoodle,The entire point is to massacre as many people at the airport as possible.
02-07-2019T23:37:31,Dadrobit,"Also, the level plays itself, you don't have to kill a single person if you don't want to."
02-07-2019T23:37:35,AspiringNoodle,Fun fact: You don't have to shoot anyone
02-07-2019T23:37:38,AspiringNoodle,^
02-07-2019T23:37:40,Ordithus,Hi robit!
02-07-2019T23:37:44,Dadrobit,o/
02-07-2019T23:37:50,AspiringNoodle,The only people you *may* have to shoot are the people shooting at you
02-07-2019T23:37:56,AspiringNoodle,But you don't have to kill a single soul
02-07-2019T23:38:24,AspiringNoodle,"And then the end to the level maintains the tradition of ""person you are working under shoots you in the face"""
02-07-2019T23:38:34,Ordithus,As is tradition
02-07-2019T23:38:38,Dadrobit,"Just got into work. The house is stacked with goodies for the 4th! Corn dogs, chicken wraps, apple strudel, chips, cookies, and a bunch of sodas."
02-07-2019T23:38:46,Ordithus,Nice
02-07-2019T23:38:55,AspiringNoodle,"Seriously, I should count how many times in Modern Warfare your character dies.  Preferably by being shot.  And extra points if its a person you're working for."
02-07-2019T23:39:03,AspiringNoodle,jealouuuuuuuus
02-07-2019T23:39:35,AspiringNoodle,"But yeah, the context for the airport mission arives at the end when Makarov takes your hand, as if he's about to pull you into the getaway vehicle"
02-07-2019T23:39:37,Dadrobit,Ohhhh~ peanut butter pretzels too!
02-07-2019T23:40:00,AspiringNoodle,"But then pulls out a gun with his other one, shoots you in the chest, and then leaves you there at the scene to start global conflict"
02-07-2019T23:40:22,AspiringNoodle,But people didn't give 2 shits about that
02-07-2019T23:40:35,Ordithus,Isn't the characer an undercover agent or something?
02-07-2019T23:40:38,AspiringNoodle,They had to clutch their pearls at the prospect of you shooting up a bunch of people in a virtual airport :/
02-07-2019T23:40:40,Dadrobit,Darn cinematic bullets always doing more damage...
02-07-2019T23:40:58,AspiringNoodle,"Yup, you're an American mole who infiltrated Makarov's organization"
02-07-2019T23:41:00,Ordithus,"But... phoenix down!  Aerith, why?!"
02-07-2019T23:41:13,AspiringNoodle,But Makarov knew the whole time.
02-07-2019T23:41:44,Dadrobit,Phoenix down didn't work because she was still alive. Cloud unwittingly was her real killer when he drowned her.
02-07-2019T23:41:50,AspiringNoodle,^^^
02-07-2019T23:41:52,Ordithus,Nooooooo
02-07-2019T23:41:58,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-LauraCry:
02-07-2019T23:42:12,AspiringNoodle,I find it funny.  The biggest controversies in gaming tend to come from people who only ever skim the issue
02-07-2019T23:42:21,AspiringNoodle,Like GTA3
02-07-2019T23:42:30,Ordithus,"On its face, it is pretty damn horrible"
02-07-2019T23:42:41,AspiringNoodle,I'm gonna stop you right ther
02-07-2019T23:42:57,AspiringNoodle,Because the face is all they ever look at before they go full sperg and form an unwaivering opinion on the matter
02-07-2019T23:43:34,AspiringNoodle,"Feel free to continue, I just wanted to make a point xD"
02-07-2019T23:43:39,Dadrobit,"Extra Credits? Didn't watch the episode, burnt saw the downvote ratio. Haven't watched them in a while, but have they really changed that much?"
02-07-2019T23:43:50,Dadrobit,But saw*
02-07-2019T23:43:55,AspiringNoodle,I wouldn't say that
02-07-2019T23:44:04,AspiringNoodle,This is just a horrible written / thought out video
02-07-2019T23:44:23,AspiringNoodle,Ord and I just had this discussion
02-07-2019T23:44:39,Ordithus,"Noodle and I have been talking about it for a while.  I think it's good that the video makes you think, but they didn't do a good job."
02-07-2019T23:44:47,AspiringNoodle,They are more or less trying to insert the stigma of bad actors into multiplaye when the context is generally missing :/
02-07-2019T23:44:59,Ordithus,Pretty much that
02-07-2019T23:45:02,Dadrobit,I seem to recall they did an exposé on Spec Ops The Line yeah? That it was important to showcase the worst kinds of stories and shock people?
02-07-2019T23:45:14,AspiringNoodle,yeah...
02-07-2019T23:45:43,Dadrobit,But now multiplayer Nazis are just too much...
02-07-2019T23:45:45,AspiringNoodle,"Their argument is that ""Playing as nazis or terrorists in multiplayer normalizes nazis and terrorists, making them less stigmatized, andmore likely you'll end up becoming like them"""
02-07-2019T23:46:14,Dadrobit,Hopefully this doesn't become a trend for them...
02-07-2019T23:46:21,AspiringNoodle,"Classic case of, ""You're too stupid to realize what's for your own good, so we need to decide for you"""
02-07-2019T23:46:27,AspiringNoodle,I'm hoping it's a one off
02-07-2019T23:46:47,Dadrobit,"I really loved their extra history stuffs, but again, haven't seen anything by then in a while."
02-07-2019T23:46:56,Ordithus,"Eh, watch it.  Form your own opinion.  Think about it."
02-07-2019T23:47:22,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I'll still watch it later tonight after the parties are done."
02-07-2019T23:47:34,Ordithus,"Perhaps I thought more AROUND their argument, but it made me think. I like that."
02-07-2019T23:47:51,Ordithus,I don't agree with their particular issues and solutions.
02-07-2019T23:47:59,AspiringNoodle,I've slowly become more aware of bs when I see it
02-07-2019T23:48:13,AspiringNoodle,I've always tried to be the optimist or the live and let live
02-07-2019T23:48:42,AspiringNoodle,"But now I'm standing my ground more and more, and calling stuff for what it is as I see it"
02-07-2019T23:49:06,Ordithus,Where's the fun in that
02-07-2019T23:49:20,Ordithus,You're becoming an old codger
02-07-2019T23:49:31,AspiringNoodle,It's called idealogues are trying to ruin games because it offends their sensibilities
02-07-2019T23:49:39,Dadrobit,Know what makes me optimistic? White chocolate macidamion(sp?) but cookies. I am in heaven.
02-07-2019T23:49:39,AspiringNoodle,But they don't even play the damn things and expect us to put up with it.
02-07-2019T23:49:59,Dadrobit,Nut cookies*
02-07-2019T23:50:00,Ordithus,Cookies are a reason to be optimistic
02-07-2019T23:50:21,AspiringNoodle,"Ord, if you have the shaking nat emote, now would be the time"
02-07-2019T23:50:25,AspiringNoodle,BECAUSE COOKIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES

02-07-2019T23:52:25,AspiringNoodle,In the time it took the likes to go up by 400
02-07-2019T23:52:30,AspiringNoodle,The dislikes went up another 3k
02-07-2019T23:53:52,Ordithus,Who knew delving into politics would be controversial.
02-07-2019T23:54:31,SpazztasticKiwi,you think in aquaman Arthur’s moms like “damn my son grew up hot”
02-07-2019T23:54:37,Dadrobit,I wonder if it got picked up by Reddit and spread around?
02-07-2019T23:54:57,Ordithus,It already has more views than most videos from the past few months
02-07-2019T23:55:01,Dadrobit,"Haven't seen Aquaman yet, no spoilers pls."
02-07-2019T23:55:11,AspiringNoodle,I wouldn't say it was the politics so much as the fact that they pushed a position / suggestions based on faulty logic and ridiculous assumptions
02-07-2019T23:55:37,AspiringNoodle,"Also, TheQuartering had a video on this video today (man he works fast)"
02-07-2019T23:56:11,Ordithus,"This video also has WAY more reactions than typical, positive or negativ"
02-07-2019T23:56:13,SpazztasticKiwi,haven’t seen aquaman
02-07-2019T23:56:25,SpazztasticKiwi,and how longs it been out now
02-07-2019T23:56:30,Ordithus,A few months
02-07-2019T23:56:43,AspiringNoodle,"And yes, Aquaman did grow up hot"
02-07-2019T23:56:53,AspiringNoodle,"""Oh no... my son... he's HOT O///O"""
02-07-2019T23:56:56,Dadrobit,I haven't even seen Star Wars Ep 7 yet yo
02-07-2019T23:57:06,SpazztasticKiwi,“Damn that was a good egg”
02-07-2019T23:57:13,AspiringNoodle,7 is good
02-07-2019T23:57:18,AspiringNoodle,8 is controversial / split
02-07-2019T23:57:19,Ordithus,"Robit, do you like Star Wars without caring about Star Wars?"
02-07-2019T23:57:27,AspiringNoodle,9 is people have already given up hope.
02-07-2019T23:57:36,Ordithus,I'll watch it to spite the fans
02-07-2019T23:57:44,Ordithus,And I'll ENJOY IT
02-07-2019T23:57:52,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-clovischuckle:
02-07-2019T23:58:23,AspiringNoodle,"I love Star Wars, but I'm not a super fan.  And I typically turn off my brain  when I go see movies"
02-07-2019T23:58:34,Dadrobit,"I'm a filthy casual when it comes to Star Wars, I like it, but I'm not going to any cons for it or anything. I'm just waiting for them to finish up this newest rehash so I can binge the whole thing start to finish."
02-07-2019T23:58:40,AspiringNoodle,"So I have 4 basic feelings: Hate it, don't care either way, enjoyed it, loved it"
02-07-2019T23:59:09,Ordithus,"In that case, you might like the movies.  The only people I know who hate them are Star Wars fans"
02-07-2019T23:59:41,AspiringNoodle,There's a scene I LOVE in episode 8.  Ironically it was controversial because people thought there were technical issues
