27-12-2019T00:02:10,ShamusTheFox,Sythe has been on a journey. And who could have seen this coming from the start?
27-12-2019T00:02:36,Tjimmy1999,I can never get if Sythe actually likes the Ice Queen.
27-12-2019T00:02:53,Tjimmy1999,He has more relationship chances with Nibbly.
27-12-2019T00:03:23,NezumiYuki,Easy way to settle this... Sythe+Nibbly+Maren 3way
27-12-2019T00:03:28,NezumiYuki,xD
27-12-2019T00:03:31,Pwatcher67,so tom when will this page be done?
27-12-2019T00:04:17,SageSaga,soon
27-12-2019T00:04:20,ShamusTheFox,"He has something in common with her, though. They both lost their love interest to the other's love interest. Not exactly a great way to start a relationship, but there are worse."
27-12-2019T00:04:37,Pwatcher67,who are you sage?
27-12-2019T00:04:56,SageSaga,"I am Sage, Lord of Updates"
27-12-2019T00:04:57,NezumiYuki,Who is Sage?

27-12-2019T00:05:00,CrRAR,sage is almighty
27-12-2019T00:05:01,NezumiYuki,Sage is...
27-12-2019T00:05:04,NezumiYuki,Sage is SAGE
27-12-2019T00:05:08,unsteddyphoenix,blessed update sage
27-12-2019T00:05:10,Tjimmy1999,I keep forgetting Maren and Trace had a relationship to begin with.
27-12-2019T00:05:22,Tjimmy1999,This is the guy who never really moved on from his dead wife.
27-12-2019T00:05:37,Pwatcher67,"but was asking tom, sage"
27-12-2019T00:05:49,FloofyCat,"For a minute I thought that was Kat in the bottom left corner with the brown hair, but then I realised it's obviously Sythe."
27-12-2019T00:05:52,ShamusTheFox,We never really saw any of that relationship or how healthy it was.
27-12-2019T00:05:54,SageSaga,yeah- so be thankful that i blessed you with information
27-12-2019T00:05:54,MuonNeutrino,it was apparently only nominally a 'relationship'
27-12-2019T00:06:05,MuonNeutrino,"from the descriptions, it was pretty casual on at least trace's part"
27-12-2019T00:06:09,FloofyCat,Dunno how I managed to make that mistake.
27-12-2019T00:06:24,CrRAR,slaps were earned
27-12-2019T00:06:56,KuroganeWatanoshi,OMG the music fits perfectly with Tom's drawing!!!!
27-12-2019T00:07:08,Tjimmy1999,"At least Maren isn't ""Tsundare"" enough to slap the wolf for such a gesture."
27-12-2019T00:07:32,ShamusTheFox,"Maren either took him up on the proposal or just told him she's pregnant, one of the two."
27-12-2019T00:08:16,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-natsducky:
27-12-2019T00:08:33,NezumiYuki,And thank the Twokinds gods that Maren isn't Yandere!
27-12-2019T00:08:33,unsteddyphoenix,Dude im hype
27-12-2019T00:08:47,unsteddyphoenix,Every character hooks up before keith and Natani best timeline :D
27-12-2019T00:08:54,SageSaga,Pwatcher - It's unlikely Tom will respond to a message like that unless he catches it when he takes a breather- my answer is about as good as you would get though seeing as he usually posts it sometime into Saturday Morning
27-12-2019T00:09:00,ShamusTheFox,Evil Trace probably wasn't the sort to give flowers and candy.
27-12-2019T00:09:19,Pwatcher67,oh okay sage
27-12-2019T00:09:39,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-sadtrace2:*[You had me at 'No Keidran!']
27-12-2019T00:09:40,SageSaga,often he will stop streaming once he finishes and do the text and post it - so since hes almost done it could be up in a few hours
27-12-2019T00:09:49,NezumiYuki,"Well true Shamus, Evul Trace was all about conquer, control, destroy...."
27-12-2019T00:10:11,Twokinds,You'll see...
27-12-2019T00:10:14,SageSaga,as for who I am- I am the other person streaming atm

27-12-2019T00:11:03,NezumiYuki,hmm Sage?

27-12-2019T00:13:15,InuChan,Thats what a Mastercard is for.

27-12-2019T00:29:53,KuroganeWatanoshi,how long did it take for you to get EX? I have Pro and I feel it sets me back a little... What does EX have that Pro doesn't other than animation?
27-12-2019T00:29:57,ThingsAreMoving,Right then. See ya *looks at the time* tomorrow
27-12-2019T00:30:50,SageSaga,it honestly doesnt have much over Pro other than like more 3D options and a couple not heavily used tools
27-12-2019T00:30:58,SageSaga,oh and the book preview thing
27-12-2019T00:31:13,KuroganeWatanoshi,huh
27-12-2019T00:31:28,SageSaga,I was using clip for a few months when someone just bought me a copy of EX- not even an upgrade just the whole thing
27-12-2019T00:31:49,KuroganeWatanoshi,OAO
27-12-2019T00:32:02,KuroganeWatanoshi,That person deserves a big thank you
27-12-2019T00:32:02,SageSaga,it was pretty sweet
27-12-2019T00:32:28,CrimsonHelsing,Thanks again Tom! see you Sunday! And happy holidays/Merry Christmas to you too!
27-12-2019T00:32:34,MoonDance,That was nice of them :)
27-12-2019T00:32:36,KuroganeWatanoshi,idk what I would do if I got EX. Probably try more animation work since it gives you a full timeline
27-12-2019T00:33:09,CrimsonHelsing,"wow, Sage, that was *very* nice of them o.o"
27-12-2019T00:34:42,AspiringNoodle,I'd say Sage has paid them back in full with interest by this point ;)
27-12-2019T00:34:46,KuroganeWatanoshi,"well, I am gonna go watch some more Naruto~ I am like near the end of the first anime!!!"
27-12-2019T00:34:56,AspiringNoodle,DATTEBAYO!
27-12-2019T00:35:06,KuroganeWatanoshi,KAGEBENSHI NO JUISTU!!!
27-12-2019T00:35:37,KuroganeWatanoshi,"XD goodsleeping everyone"""
27-12-2019T00:35:58,SageSaga,just a few more weeks folks
27-12-2019T00:36:28,KeefMcDerpface,Few more weeks for what?
27-12-2019T00:36:39,SageSaga,MHW Iceborne!
27-12-2019T00:36:52,KeefMcDerpface,okay.
27-12-2019T00:37:09,AspiringNoodle,"""Hunt the same monsters you've been hunting since launch... ON ICE!!!"" :d"
27-12-2019T00:37:21,SageSaga,wrong!
27-12-2019T00:37:31,AspiringNoodle,Can't a man have his jokes? :P
27-12-2019T00:37:34,SageSaga,its mostly on snow
27-12-2019T00:37:47,AspiringNoodle,I don't know whether to hug you or hit you xD
27-12-2019T00:38:19,AspiringNoodle,"I choose hug, since it's less likely to get me banned"
27-12-2019T00:40:22,unsteddyphoenix,Youd be surprised
27-12-2019T00:41:13,SageSaga,im not a masochist so im probably more likely to enjoy a hug than a hit- but then again- PERSONAL SPACE IS IMPORTANT TO ME
27-12-2019T00:41:16,SageSaga,XD
27-12-2019T00:41:42,MarvTheHugPharaoh,If we ever meet or we both know someone who's gonna meet you expect a hug from me
27-12-2019T00:41:55,SageSaga,planning on going to any cons?
27-12-2019T00:42:04,AspiringNoodle,"Marv, make sure to bring the fluffiest of breads"
27-12-2019T00:42:05,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Nope, not a fan of cons"
27-12-2019T00:42:08,AspiringNoodle,Or it might be awkward
27-12-2019T00:42:21,SageSaga,then you will likely never meet me
27-12-2019T00:42:37,AspiringNoodle,"Wait, so sage has only 2 settings? Home or Con?"
27-12-2019T00:42:46,SageSaga,"I only come out of my Cave for D&D, Food, and Cons"
27-12-2019T00:42:53,AspiringNoodle,#ChallengeAccepted
27-12-2019T00:43:04,unsteddyphoenix,at the same time?
27-12-2019T00:43:18,SageSaga,most of the time i dont even have to go to my front door for packages- they somehow end up at my bedroom door
27-12-2019T00:43:19,ZRO4825,One day I shall level up enough to gain the stats needed to withstand a con...
27-12-2019T00:43:31,KeefMcDerpface,Same.
27-12-2019T00:43:48,AspiringNoodle,One day I shall level up enough money to attend a con :P
27-12-2019T00:44:42,KeefMcDerpface,"The only con I can go to are ones in LA or San Diego, but money to get in is more than the travel."
27-12-2019T00:44:59,AspiringNoodle,You couldn't pay me to touch CA atm :P
27-12-2019T00:45:12,KeefMcDerpface,But San Diego Comic Con does have events outside that are free.
27-12-2019T00:45:22,KeefMcDerpface,If I recall.
27-12-2019T00:45:24,AspiringNoodle,"...still couldn't pay me, haha"
27-12-2019T00:45:45,SageSaga,all cons are free - if you dont go inside- and even most of them will let you in to a certain point
27-12-2019T00:45:49,KeefMcDerpface,"Even if you could, I wouldn't sugest you to come."
27-12-2019T00:46:34,AspiringNoodle,Come to the North US states :D
27-12-2019T00:46:40,AspiringNoodle,"It's cold, wet, and sometimes we have snow!"
27-12-2019T00:46:45,AspiringNoodle,...why don't we have more snow ;_;
27-12-2019T00:46:52,KeefMcDerpface,Sold.
27-12-2019T00:47:05,KeefMcDerpface,But What about Canda?
27-12-2019T00:47:14,KeefMcDerpface,*Canada?
27-12-2019T00:47:17,AspiringNoodle,CANADAISFOR[redacted]
27-12-2019T00:47:36,unsteddyphoenix,snowboarding
27-12-2019T00:48:03,AspiringNoodle,"My apologies, what I meant to say is that Canada is a lovely place full of fun attractions, beautiful environments, a rich culture, and friendly people."
27-12-2019T00:48:15,KeefMcDerpface,"""Yeah, f**k you Canada."" - Some guy on the internet."
27-12-2019T00:48:20,AspiringNoodle,It is one of the loveliest places you could think of visiting.
27-12-2019T00:48:24,KeefMcDerpface,Dam it Noddle!
27-12-2019T00:48:56,AspiringNoodle,"And yes, this is Noodle, and not a secret Canadian Agent sent to reeductate Noodle."
27-12-2019T00:49:26,KeefMcDerpface,"Anyways, I never saw the appeal of Cali."
27-12-2019T00:49:37,KeefMcDerpface,It's just s**t.
27-12-2019T00:49:45,KeefMcDerpface,Outside of the food.
27-12-2019T00:49:48,AspiringNoodle,Its reputation more or less precedes / outlasts it
27-12-2019T00:50:09,Ordithus,"It's a big state, with lots of stuff, scenery, activities, all sorts of things?"
27-12-2019T00:50:10,AspiringNoodle,"For the longest time, it was a land where dreams came true.  It had many opportunities and was basically the only place to get into show biz"
27-12-2019T00:50:23,KeefMcDerpface,99.9% chance of becoming homeless now.
27-12-2019T00:50:35,KeefMcDerpface,"In other words, don't come here."
27-12-2019T00:50:40,KeefMcDerpface,Ever.
27-12-2019T00:50:47,AspiringNoodle,"But even as we speak the industries that are the state's claim to fame (you know, 20% of US GDP) are fleeing the state"
27-12-2019T00:51:14,AspiringNoodle,"I'm just waiting to see how long before most of Hollywood abandons, followed by big tech and the games industry"
27-12-2019T00:51:41,SageSaga,there's still cheap places to live in Cali- it's a big state- its not just LA
27-12-2019T00:51:52,AspiringNoodle,"Unfortunately, places like LA tend to run the state"
27-12-2019T00:52:01,Ordithus,That's where the people are
27-12-2019T00:52:04,KeefMcDerpface,"Sage is right, I live out in the desert."
27-12-2019T00:52:17,AspiringNoodle,Do you have a lot of political say where you live?
27-12-2019T00:52:23,KeefMcDerpface,But it's f**king hot come summer.
27-12-2019T00:52:44,KeefMcDerpface,I don't want to talk about it Noodle.
27-12-2019T00:52:54,AspiringNoodle,Signs point to no. :ptv-hearts:
27-12-2019T00:53:09,AspiringNoodle,"Also, THESE TEMPERATURES ARE TOO DAMN HIGH! *buys more ice cream*"
27-12-2019T00:53:22,KeefMcDerpface,Talk politics and you're dead to me.
27-12-2019T00:53:47,KeefMcDerpface,There is a ice cream shop in Palm Springs that's really good.
27-12-2019T00:54:00,AspiringNoodle,Politics politics politics. Politics. Politics politics.
27-12-2019T00:54:04,KeefMcDerpface,That's what I mean about the food.
27-12-2019T00:54:04,AspiringNoodle,Is it working yet? <3
27-12-2019T00:54:38,KeefMcDerpface,...
27-12-2019T00:54:49,SageSaga,Noodle is trying to become a Zombie!
27-12-2019T00:54:55,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-shock:
27-12-2019T00:54:59,KeefMcDerpface,Should we kill him?
27-12-2019T00:54:59,AspiringNoodle,NO WANT BECOME ZOMBIE!!!
27-12-2019T00:55:01,Ordithus,"Anyways, Callum is clearly better at math than Kaylin"
27-12-2019T00:55:17,SageSaga,yes but not in this case
27-12-2019T00:55:42,AspiringNoodle,I hope you're referring to Ord's statement :ptv-whiny:
27-12-2019T00:55:50,AspiringNoodle,I think Keef just grabbed the chainsaw
27-12-2019T00:55:59,SageSaga,i am talking about what ord said
27-12-2019T00:56:06,AspiringNoodle,*phew*
27-12-2019T00:56:18,KeefMcDerpface,Who needs chainsaw when you can akimbo body pillow.
27-12-2019T00:56:25,SageSaga,"Callum is smart boy, but he doesnt know the RL time equation"
27-12-2019T00:56:25,Ordithus,although Kaylin's statement is technically correct
27-12-2019T00:56:33,Ordithus,"Oh, yeah"
27-12-2019T00:56:44,AspiringNoodle,TK body pillows? :P
27-12-2019T00:56:48,AspiringNoodle,Or AI?
27-12-2019T00:56:53,Ordithus,"I like, forgot that until now :ctwokinds-keifacepalm:"
27-12-2019T00:57:25,KeefMcDerpface,Which ever one kills you faster Noodle.
27-12-2019T00:57:35,SageSaga,well - last i checked the difference between Twokinds Bodypillows and AI bodypillows is- that AI body pillows exist
27-12-2019T00:57:46,KeefMcDerpface,AI it is.
27-12-2019T00:57:57,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-karenOOO:
27-12-2019T00:58:12,Ordithus,Though I'm sure there are unofficial TK dakis
27-12-2019T00:58:19,AspiringNoodle,^
27-12-2019T00:59:36,KeefMcDerpface,"Anyways, one thing I find funny is when people say it doesn't snow in Cali even though it did this week."
27-12-2019T01:00:02,KeefMcDerpface,It went as far south as to the border.
27-12-2019T01:00:21,KeefMcDerpface,According to radar.
27-12-2019T01:00:38,SageSaga,i dont think thats funny- i think that it's a generalization that is relatively true right?
27-12-2019T01:00:46,SageSaga,it does not often snow in Cali- right?
27-12-2019T01:00:51,Ordithus,Mountains
27-12-2019T01:01:07,AspiringNoodle,^
27-12-2019T01:01:08,SageSaga,mountains do not always mean snow
27-12-2019T01:01:12,KeefMcDerpface,Yes you're Sage but when people say it's like it NEVER snows.
27-12-2019T01:01:18,KeefMcDerpface,*right
27-12-2019T01:01:19,AspiringNoodle,There are many high altitude areas in Cali that get pretty regular snow
27-12-2019T01:01:24,SageSaga,do you really think they mean never?
27-12-2019T01:01:24,Ordithus,"LA or San Francisco though probably very rare, but I don't live there"
27-12-2019T01:01:41,KeefMcDerpface,Big Bear mountain.
27-12-2019T01:01:51,KeefMcDerpface,Look it up.
27-12-2019T01:02:00,Ordithus,I can tell you where it DOES snow.  Where I live
27-12-2019T01:02:15,AspiringNoodle,GIVE
27-12-2019T01:02:16,AspiringNoodle,ME
27-12-2019T01:02:17,SageSaga,"when someone says ""California"" how many people understand they are probably talking about the LA area?"
27-12-2019T01:02:19,Ordithus,:cloud_snow::snowman2::cloud_snow:
27-12-2019T01:02:30,KeefMcDerpface,Everyone Sage.
27-12-2019T01:02:36,KeefMcDerpface,Everyone.
27-12-2019T01:02:36,AspiringNoodle,[GIMME UR SN0W]*:ptv-angry
27-12-2019T01:02:41,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-angry:
27-12-2019T01:02:57,Ordithus,[take this]*:ptv-right: :
27-12-2019T01:03:04,SageSaga,"then if someone says - it never snows in Cali- they are probably saying ""It practically never snows in LA"""
27-12-2019T01:03:11,KeefMcDerpface,Yes.
27-12-2019T01:03:11,SageSaga,is that a correct statement?
27-12-2019T01:03:15,KeefMcDerpface,Yes.
27-12-2019T01:03:34,SageSaga,then seems like an ok thing to say
27-12-2019T01:03:46,Sclimshady,It snows all the time in the high desert
27-12-2019T01:03:47,AspiringNoodle,"Ord, I'm so excited~"
27-12-2019T01:03:53,Sclimshady,Just not the coast
27-12-2019T01:03:54,AspiringNoodle,I'm finally replacing the tires on my car :D
27-12-2019T01:04:19,KeefMcDerpface,And then there are those who put housing in flood control areas.
27-12-2019T01:04:26,Ordithus,"Congrats, Noodle"
27-12-2019T01:04:42,AspiringNoodle,It's the first time I've done this <3
27-12-2019T01:04:53,Ordithus,Old tires worn to belts?  Or fancy new tires?
27-12-2019T01:05:09,AspiringNoodle,"I bought this car used, and the tires are relatively new, but they are horrible for snow, even though they M+S rated"
27-12-2019T01:05:12,KeefMcDerpface,Anyways I'm going to go.
27-12-2019T01:05:15,KeefMcDerpface,Night all.
27-12-2019T01:05:23,AspiringNoodle,So I am getting Firestone's new Weathergrip tires
27-12-2019T01:05:28,Ordithus,o/ keef
27-12-2019T01:06:00,AspiringNoodle,"Night Keef, body pillow dreams for you~"
27-12-2019T01:06:21,KeefMcDerpface,Those body pillows aren't for hugging.
27-12-2019T01:06:27,KeefMcDerpface,They are for killing.
27-12-2019T01:06:35,AspiringNoodle,Sexy killing?
27-12-2019T01:07:01,KeefMcDerpface,Let me try something.
27-12-2019T01:07:34,KeefMcDerpface,is a reliable reindeer.

27-12-2019T01:42:04,SageSaga,currently- a 16TB HDD is around 500 dollars
27-12-2019T01:42:45,SageSaga,but each time a higher capacity drive comes out the prices on others goes down
27-12-2019T01:46:56,Ordithus,I'm Bach :ctwokinds-nibsdance:

27-12-2019T01:48:15,Ordithus,Actually I am in the deep South of Wisconsin for now
27-12-2019T01:48:23,Ordithus,No snow here right now
27-12-2019T01:48:23,ZRO4825,"Personally I just want around a 4TB or so SSD. Buuuut, money. :V lol"
27-12-2019T01:48:39,AspiringNoodle,I splurged and got a 2TB NVME drive :ptv-uneasy:
27-12-2019T01:49:06,AspiringNoodle,"My reasoning?  That's as large a drive you can use for a boot drive without a little technical knowhow, hehe"
27-12-2019T01:50:40,SageSaga,i bought a 1TB NVMe but i have another slot open for another NVMe drive
27-12-2019T01:50:51,SageSaga,*not really a drive but whatever*
27-12-2019T01:51:53,Ordithus,someday I will upgrade past AM3+ hardware and enter the post 2011 world

27-12-2019T02:25:38,Dadrobit,Maren meanwhile got out of a relationship with Trace and is now gonna get what Flora left to the side.
27-12-2019T02:26:04,Dadrobit,"Maren, actually incredible taste."
27-12-2019T02:26:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I say Maren won this game tbh

27-12-2019T02:36:46,SpazztasticKiwi,I like the dark chocolate n caramels
27-12-2019T02:37:39,Dadrobit,Still have a few of those around the gatehouse.
27-12-2019T02:37:55,Dadrobit,Literally too much food and candy here right now
27-12-2019T02:38:49,Dadrobit,And my Grandma kinda missed the mark this Christmas and I feel so bad for it.

27-12-2019T02:44:28,AspiringNoodle,Imagine a world where weed is completely legal everywhere
27-12-2019T02:44:52,AspiringNoodle,We must work towards that future.
27-12-2019T02:45:32,Dadrobit,"Also, it would take me fuckin forever to work through that much."
27-12-2019T02:45:51,Dadrobit,Even dadrobit circa 2010 woulda balked at that.
27-12-2019T02:46:01,AspiringNoodle,I don't think it's physically possible to OD on weed
27-12-2019T02:46:06,AspiringNoodle,Take a week off ;D
27-12-2019T02:46:45,Dadrobit,There are some complications that can happen. Mostly affects folks that are multiple times daily users.
27-12-2019T02:47:48,Dadrobit,"Something like 5% have adverse affects including nausia, anxiety, and a complete loss of appetite."
27-12-2019T02:48:11,Dadrobit,It basically becomes the exact opposite of what weed normally does.
27-12-2019T02:49:12,Dadrobit,Pops found out the hard way when he retired and suddenly became a smoker again and just went ham on the dispensary.
27-12-2019T02:49:54,Dadrobit,"Dude lost a dangerous amount of weight in a very short period of time, eventually had to go to the hospital."

27-12-2019T04:24:47,Dadrobit,Seems my previous call of meeting up in Sythe's room nailed it. Just need to show a panel of Nibs getting kicked out for the full call :D
27-12-2019T04:25:09,Dadrobit,There was a stream but I personally missed it.
27-12-2019T04:25:27,CrimsonQuill,I just got back into the community Christmas day.
27-12-2019T04:25:35,Dadrobit,Wb
27-12-2019T04:25:38,CrimsonQuill,So I'm rereading the comic (Again)
27-12-2019T04:25:40,BadFoMo,Cool.
27-12-2019T04:26:10,BadFoMo,I should get back into it too.
27-12-2019T04:26:12,CrimsonQuill,"Terra told me that literally two minutes after I left, three months ago, my suggestion was posted on Patreon."
27-12-2019T04:26:26,CrimsonQuill,It was a nice Christmas present anyhow.
27-12-2019T04:27:15,CrimsonQuill,I'm going to do my best to be a bit more civil in chat this year. (And maybe not make as many walls of text like these ones).
27-12-2019T04:28:17,Dadrobit,"Not much has changed, I think I'm still on the same one as 3 months ago lol"
27-12-2019T04:30:07,BadFoMo,@CrimsonQuill You /wern't/ civil?
27-12-2019T04:34:21,Dadrobit,"Was my last successful request Maddie in a windtunnel? I can't recall any, but I feel like I've had to have gotten something in since then?"

27-12-2019T04:39:24,BadFoMo,"While we're on the topic, due to it not being Christmas any more, I'm changing my request."
27-12-2019T04:39:52,BadFoMo,How does this sound? '50.	How would the fight between Trace and Mary ( http://robbiethe1st.afraid.org/twokinds/20040308.jpg & http://robbiethe1st.afraid.org/twokinds/20040310.jpg ) have gone if she had somehow reflected his spell back at him?'
27-12-2019T04:39:56,CrimsonQuill,"Heh, I still have to rejoin the Patreon"
27-12-2019T04:40:05,CrimsonQuill,"That being said, I'd vote for that"
27-12-2019T04:40:15,BadFoMo,Cool!
27-12-2019T04:40:28,CrimsonQuill,I've a feeling I've seen it before
27-12-2019T04:40:42,CrimsonQuill,"What's your suggestion again, Dadrobit?"
27-12-2019T04:40:47,BadFoMo,It was so close to winning the first time.
27-12-2019T04:41:40,Dadrobit,"Sythe in regalia giving diplomatic ""advice"" to the Basitin trio. Lynn is studiously taking notes, but the other two are suspicious."

27-12-2019T04:42:30,CrimsonQuill,I'm kind of stumped as to what I'd suggest next
27-12-2019T04:42:33,BadFoMo,I'll keep voting for it.
27-12-2019T04:44:31,Dadrobit,This week was the mega poll right? Didn't get to see how well (poorly lol) it did.
27-12-2019T04:44:56,Dadrobit,Might check the vid later.
27-12-2019T04:45:48,BadFoMo,Tom showed the results in this stream?
27-12-2019T04:46:22,CrimsonQuill,"Is TK polls used at all these days, or has it gone fully to the mega poll?"
27-12-2019T04:46:32,Dadrobit,I assume he did on Sunday before doing sketches?
27-12-2019T04:46:58,Dadrobit,Just this once he tried the mega one again.
27-12-2019T04:47:58,Dadrobit,"I'd have to check it out when I'm home, no chance I'm making out the text of a hundred or so suggestions on a phone screen."
27-12-2019T04:48:26,CrimsonQuill,Hmmm
27-12-2019T04:48:30,BadFoMo,"It's mostly TK Polls, but for this week (due to there being no stream this week) he used an Omni-Poll. ...Which I find better."
27-12-2019T04:48:49,CrimsonQuill,Ok then.
27-12-2019T04:49:23,CrimsonQuill,I start back at work on Monday...today and tomorrow are my last days at home before heading back to the city for the exam study

27-12-2019T15:02:46,SageSaga,yeah so- this says its in the red- my net seems fine- so it must be my connection to picarto

27-12-2019T15:09:00,SageSaga,im doing what i can
27-12-2019T15:09:56,BadFoMo,What all are you doing (not that I have any advice to help)?
27-12-2019T15:10:09,SageSaga,i could try changing which server i send to Picarto
27-12-2019T15:10:29,SageSaga,i did a trace route and saw that one of the hops to the picarto server is having time outs
27-12-2019T15:11:02,BadFoMo,That is all over my head.
27-12-2019T15:11:14,SageSaga,so its my connection to Picartos server - so changing which server might help- but im using the closest one to reduce chances of this happening
27-12-2019T15:12:35,SageSaga,ok think of my internet as a line of trucks sending pictures and audio to a building called Picarto- at one of the stop lights the light is broken and its causing delays and sometimes trucks have to be ignored to try and catch up
27-12-2019T15:13:18,BadFoMo,...Ok.
27-12-2019T15:13:18,SageSaga,if i changed servers it would take them longer to get there- but it might not have a broken stoplight!
27-12-2019T15:13:37,BadFoMo,I think I got that.
27-12-2019T15:14:13,BadFoMo,Another light broke.
27-12-2019T15:14:56,CrimsonQuill,Goodnight all

27-12-2019T15:18:03,SageSaga,im gonna stick with it for 20 minutes more or so and see if it clears up
27-12-2019T15:22:14,Dakina,Ello.
27-12-2019T15:22:36,SageSaga,yo
27-12-2019T15:22:37,sunblaze,hmm maybe it cleared up. seems more stable now
27-12-2019T15:22:42,sunblaze,*thumbs up*
27-12-2019T15:23:02,SageSaga,im still getting dropped frames notifications though
27-12-2019T15:26:20,Katfeathers,Part of the problem when the telecoms that have become the ISPs know that the FCC is currently helmed by their pawn.
27-12-2019T15:29:00,SageSaga,ok dropped frames have reached more than 50% - gonna see if i can switch servers
27-12-2019T15:29:40,sunblaze,good luck
27-12-2019T15:31:11,Katfeathers,Is it better?
27-12-2019T15:31:20,SageSaga,"not many options for servers- US ""east"" which isnt really east- US West and... Germany"

27-12-2019T15:33:19,SageSaga,Operation went fine
27-12-2019T15:33:27,SageSaga,no Cancer
27-12-2019T15:33:41,TeapotOfDoom,Glad to hear
27-12-2019T15:33:45,Katfeathers,Much good is!
27-12-2019T15:33:56,TeapotOfDoom,:ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
27-12-2019T15:34:05,sunblaze,indeed
27-12-2019T15:34:22,SageSaga,ooook gonna try germany
27-12-2019T15:34:55,TeapotOfDoom,Now that would be a new one. Good connection from murica to europe
27-12-2019T15:35:08,Katfeathers,Heh
27-12-2019T15:36:26,SageSaga,doesnt look like this is fixable on my end
27-12-2019T15:36:51,Katfeathers,"Again, itaii"
27-12-2019T15:37:42,Katfeathers,"... might have dropped a t in that, I forget."
27-12-2019T15:38:48,SageSaga,gonna try something desperate
27-12-2019T15:39:27,BadFoMo,YouTobe's streaming service?
27-12-2019T15:39:36,BadFoMo,*YouTube

27-12-2019T15:44:09,BadFoMo,Hi!
27-12-2019T15:45:02,SageSaga,that looks more stable (went back to East Coast too)
27-12-2019T15:45:06,TeapotOfDoom,Yay finally got a stream
27-12-2019T15:45:08,Katfeathers,Maybe Nibblie's cousin Volt should be contracted to deal with the problem node so it drops out of the equation.
27-12-2019T15:45:23,SageSaga,aaaand it dipped again
27-12-2019T15:45:55,BadFoMo,@Katfeathers Who and who?
27-12-2019T15:46:15,Katfeathers,The squirrels
27-12-2019T15:46:34,TeapotOfDoom,I didn't even know Nibs had a cousin
27-12-2019T15:47:07,Katfeathers,"Close enough, all are feral squirrels"
27-12-2019T15:47:37,SageSaga,*When someone uses headcanon from fiction to solve RL problems*
27-12-2019T15:47:55,TeapotOfDoom,alway works
27-12-2019T15:48:16,Katfeathers,And in Volt's case an agent of electrical mayhem
27-12-2019T15:48:34,Katfeathers,:ptv-condescending:
27-12-2019T15:48:40,BadFoMo,@SageSaga Losing your faith in us again?
27-12-2019T15:48:57,SageSaga,why dont we just get harry potter and the Terminator and have them team up to take on the evil net goblins?
27-12-2019T15:49:19,sunblaze,^perfect b-movie plot!
27-12-2019T15:49:29,BadFoMo,Hollywood: Hmm...
27-12-2019T15:49:52,TeapotOfDoom,I'm in
27-12-2019T15:50:22,Katfeathers,"Hey, if IRL Chaos Mages can actually apothiosify Daffy Duck..."
27-12-2019T15:50:30,TeapotOfDoom,get to da keyboad
27-12-2019T15:52:25,Katfeathers,*apotheosify
27-12-2019T15:54:20,Katfeathers,"Ya, he's actually a thing now. Since the 90s or so. I try not to think about the implications to much."
27-12-2019T15:55:18,TeapotOfDoom,wut
27-12-2019T15:56:42,Katfeathers,There is a Chaos God that for all intents and purposes is the previously fictional character Daffy Duck.
27-12-2019T15:57:14,SageSaga,see- you should probably just ignore Kat
27-12-2019T15:57:36,TeapotOfDoom,well i thhink thathh not very nithhe
27-12-2019T15:57:50,BadFoMo,Kat?
27-12-2019T15:57:51,Katfeathers,Heh
27-12-2019T15:57:51,TeapotOfDoom,to use daffy like thhat
27-12-2019T15:58:17,TeapotOfDoom,Katfeahters @fomo
27-12-2019T15:58:25,BadFoMo,Ah.
27-12-2019T15:58:57,TeapotOfDoom,not our precious kat :ctwokinds-daydreamingkat:
27-12-2019T15:59:50,BadFoMo,"So, is the stream loading for anyone else?"
27-12-2019T15:59:53,Katfeathers,"Some day ya learn things ya didn't expect to add to ""seen things"""
27-12-2019T16:00:12,SageSaga,its more stable than it was- but not by much
27-12-2019T16:00:22,Katfeathers,Aye
27-12-2019T16:00:23,TeapotOfDoom,works fine for me rn. had to change vpn servers for throughpu reasons but now it works fine
27-12-2019T16:01:02,TeapotOfDoom,"i would like to change that to ""seen shit"" kat"
27-12-2019T16:01:15,Katfeathers,Yep
27-12-2019T16:01:18,TeapotOfDoom,cause I've seen some shit dude
27-12-2019T16:01:29,TeapotOfDoom,i've seen some shit
27-12-2019T16:02:39,SageSaga,theres a difference between seeing stuff and talking about it like its real- I used to have hallucinations- but you dont see me talking about them like they are real and should be taken seriously
27-12-2019T16:02:39,BadFoMo,"Picarto! You're supposed to be giving Sage a hard time, not me! Don't make us switch over to YouTube to stream!"
27-12-2019T16:03:11,BadFoMo,What kind of hallucinations?
27-12-2019T16:03:58,SageSaga,one time i hallucinated a door that wasnt there and some creature trying to break through it
27-12-2019T16:04:16,TeapotOfDoom,holy shit
27-12-2019T16:04:27,BadFoMo,That's not good.
27-12-2019T16:04:29,SageSaga,oh and one time i had a hallucination that my hands were getting bigger and bigger and if they grew too big they were going to crush me
27-12-2019T16:05:13,BadFoMo,What brought on these hallucinations?
27-12-2019T16:05:30,SageSaga,migraines
27-12-2019T16:05:36,BadFoMo,Sorry.
27-12-2019T16:05:37,SageSaga,had em as a kid
27-12-2019T16:05:42,TeapotOfDoom,migraines are able to do that?
27-12-2019T16:05:48,TeapotOfDoom,sheesh
27-12-2019T16:05:53,AnuSekaniArt,Hello there guys
27-12-2019T16:05:58,AnuSekaniArt,"Been a while, sorry bout that XP"
27-12-2019T16:05:59,TeapotOfDoom,hey anu o/
27-12-2019T16:06:03,AnuSekaniArt,Ey Teapot ^^
27-12-2019T16:06:10,AnuSekaniArt,Hope y'all are doing well
27-12-2019T16:06:12,Katfeathers,"Sympathies, and yeah they can."
27-12-2019T16:06:20,SageSaga,"my parents freaked out when i was screaming ""MY HANDS ARE TOO BIG IM GOING TO DIE! HELP HELP! HELP!!!!"""
27-12-2019T16:06:26,AnuSekaniArt,Pfffft XD
27-12-2019T16:06:34,TeapotOfDoom,holy hell
27-12-2019T16:06:45,TeapotOfDoom,i take it that stuff's gone now?
27-12-2019T16:06:47,BadFoMo,Dang!
27-12-2019T16:07:19,SageSaga,last one i had was the door with the mindflayer behind it- that was in Freshmen High School
27-12-2019T16:07:45,BadFoMo,Mineflayer?
27-12-2019T16:07:58,BadFoMo,*Mindflayer?
27-12-2019T16:08:33,BadFoMo,Is that a D&D thing?
27-12-2019T16:08:34,AnuSekaniArt,Mindflayer. D&D enemy that looks kinda like a human with an octopus for a head and specializes in destroying minds :P
27-12-2019T16:08:38,AnuSekaniArt,IIRC
27-12-2019T16:08:48,Katfeathers,Yep
27-12-2019T16:09:24,SageSaga,google image search it- it was the best way to explain what i saw
27-12-2019T16:09:30,TeapotOfDoom,someone's got the monster manual on hand
27-12-2019T16:09:47,AnuSekaniArt,I've perused it enough to remember what it looks like XP
27-12-2019T16:09:59,BadFoMo,Sounds like something out of HP Lovecraft.
27-12-2019T16:10:08,AnuSekaniArt,Though funny enough am working on some homebrewed magic items for a future D&D campaign right now XD
27-12-2019T16:10:22,TeapotOfDoom,i just looked that exact thing up yesterday
27-12-2019T16:10:30,AnuSekaniArt,Only took me 4 months but I finally got an idea for a campaign lol
27-12-2019T16:10:35,TeapotOfDoom,nice
27-12-2019T16:10:48,Katfeathers,It would fit in with Lovecraft stuff
27-12-2019T16:10:55,TeapotOfDoom,one day we have to at least play a picarto chat one shot xD
27-12-2019T16:11:13,TeapotOfDoom,there are so many people in here playing dnd it's insane
27-12-2019T16:11:14,AnuSekaniArt,That would be interesting lol
27-12-2019T16:11:29,AnuSekaniArt,Yeah
27-12-2019T16:11:52,AnuSekaniArt,Would rather run another system like Shadowrun or L5R but folks only seem interested in D&D or Pathfinder XP
27-12-2019T16:12:21,TeapotOfDoom,isn't shadowrun the one soly based on d6s?
27-12-2019T16:12:27,AnuSekaniArt,Pretty much XD
27-12-2019T16:12:40,Katfeathers,One of them
27-12-2019T16:12:49,AnuSekaniArt,Also cyberpunk fantasy instead of normal medieval fantasy XP
27-12-2019T16:12:50,TeapotOfDoom,friend of mine (and our dm) told me about it
27-12-2019T16:13:11,SageSaga,Shadowrun is one of my favorite settings but the system kinda sucks
27-12-2019T16:13:35,AnuSekaniArt,CGL is notorious for horribly edited rulebooks XD
27-12-2019T16:14:02,AnuSekaniArt,Every player basically needs cheat sheets to understand the rules
27-12-2019T16:14:18,Katfeathers,It used to be Fasa when they where a thing
27-12-2019T16:15:12,SageSaga,"D&D 5e for classic Fantasy, Savage Worlds for everything else"
27-12-2019T16:15:21,AnuSekaniArt,XD
27-12-2019T16:15:46,AnuSekaniArt,Well if I wanna run Eastern fantasy I'll run Legend of the Five Rings but I'll keep that in mind Sage :P
27-12-2019T16:16:44,TeapotOfDoom,"So i guess your campaign with tom, fluff and mihari is 5e?"
27-12-2019T16:16:58,SageSaga,yep- Currently they are in hell
27-12-2019T16:17:16,TeapotOfDoom,not you though?
27-12-2019T16:17:55,SageSaga,being the DM i am outside the universe
27-12-2019T16:18:05,TeapotOfDoom,ohhh you are the dm
27-12-2019T16:18:11,TeapotOfDoom,nice
27-12-2019T16:18:19,TeapotOfDoom,sounds like fun for them
27-12-2019T16:21:21,TeapotOfDoom,is it the avernus setting?
27-12-2019T16:21:25,SageSaga,"ive played in tons of 3.0 games, 3.5 games, several AD&D games, 2 4ed games, and ran and played in a bunch of 5e games- buuut- Savage Worlds games are crazy"
27-12-2019T16:21:35,TeapotOfDoom,(i had to look that thing up)
27-12-2019T16:21:53,SageSaga,yeah im running Descent into Avernus
27-12-2019T16:22:20,TeapotOfDoom,niiiiice our dm recently got the book for christmas and is reeeeally stoked about it
27-12-2019T16:22:50,TeapotOfDoom,he really want's to try and integrate the thing somewhere in our campaign
27-12-2019T16:23:04,AnuSekaniArt,I got my brother that book for Christmas
27-12-2019T16:23:29,AnuSekaniArt,I'm gonna be running a completely homebrewed world when (if) I ever get this game off the ground lol
27-12-2019T16:23:45,omnishade,how crazy are savage worlds?
27-12-2019T16:23:50,SageSaga,"for Savage Worlds though ive played in Fallout, Adventure Time, Conan, Horror School, Ghost Hunters, A bunch of Super Hero campaigns, Apocalypse world settings- even ran a horror game myself that was really fun-"
27-12-2019T16:24:08,SageSaga,oh and we use it for all our Cyberpunk games
27-12-2019T16:24:32,TeapotOfDoom,so you're running shorter games but more of them?
27-12-2019T16:24:35,SageSaga,"like where I played a ""street Cleaner"" that went by - Shillelagh Law"
27-12-2019T16:24:54,SageSaga,o_o these werent short
27-12-2019T16:25:03,SageSaga,im just old
27-12-2019T16:25:18,TeapotOfDoom,oh so you just accumulated a lot of them over time?
27-12-2019T16:25:38,AnuSekaniArt,AGe is just a number :P
27-12-2019T16:25:44,TeapotOfDoom,indeed
27-12-2019T16:25:47,SageSaga,"In adventure time i was playing a Wizard called The Install Wizard, but he died in a hellfire explosion"
27-12-2019T16:25:58,TeapotOfDoom,i mean i just got into the hobby a few months ago
27-12-2019T16:26:10,SageSaga,so then i made Hunnie
27-12-2019T16:26:11,TeapotOfDoom,YES SAGE
27-12-2019T16:26:20,TeapotOfDoom,Fear the Installation Wizard
27-12-2019T16:26:29,Katfeathers,Heh
27-12-2019T16:26:31,TeapotOfDoom,Nvidia cannot be stopped at this point
27-12-2019T16:26:31,SageSaga,she was a Water Nymph with so much charisma- she seduced a boat
27-12-2019T16:26:40,omnishade,"Why do when I hear an install wizard dying my brain just automatically makes the pun ""dont worry,he had a backup"""
27-12-2019T16:26:53,TeapotOfDoom,how do you even...?
27-12-2019T16:26:59,TeapotOfDoom,ya know waht
27-12-2019T16:27:04,SageSaga,remember though this is adventure time- the boat was intelligent
27-12-2019T16:27:07,TeapotOfDoom,i'm not even gonna ask
27-12-2019T16:27:43,SageSaga,i then seduced a bunch of beach ogres into letting me borrow their jet skii and then drove it into them
27-12-2019T16:28:01,TeapotOfDoom,poor ogres
27-12-2019T16:28:09,omnishade,So...you were the bard that seduced everything?
27-12-2019T16:28:14,SageSaga,but then the kicker- I seduced and was seduced by a hawkman
27-12-2019T16:28:44,SageSaga,"we both rolled incredibly high and the DM was like ""I think- I think this feeling you have now... is love?"""
27-12-2019T16:28:59,TeapotOfDoom,<3
27-12-2019T16:29:08,SageSaga,we both rolled like 46 on our seduction attempts
27-12-2019T16:29:24,TeapotOfDoom,did she marry him?
27-12-2019T16:29:28,omnishade,Is the singer for this the same one that sang Goblin slayer's opening?
27-12-2019T16:29:38,SageSaga,no- they couldnt- they were from two other worlds- it would never work!
27-12-2019T16:29:50,SageSaga,Omni- yes
27-12-2019T16:29:57,TeapotOfDoom,they were in love tho
27-12-2019T16:30:43,SageSaga,"it would never work- him- a strong and proud hawk man- her, a living body of water that looked like a bikini babe-"
27-12-2019T16:31:00,omnishade,Im just picturing bird person from rick and morty
27-12-2019T16:31:12,TeapotOfDoom,now that sounds even more like the perfect fit
27-12-2019T16:31:22,TeapotOfDoom,i mean it's adventure time xD
27-12-2019T16:31:29,SageSaga,i can show you a picture of exactly what this hawk man was based on XD
27-12-2019T16:32:09,TeapotOfDoom,something like a aarakocra?
27-12-2019T16:32:22,SageSaga,The Hawkmen - https://www.myconfinedspace.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/hawkmen-499x213.jpg
27-12-2019T16:32:38,omnishade,HA
27-12-2019T16:32:52,TeapotOfDoom,haha nice xD
27-12-2019T16:32:54,AnuSekaniArt,XD
27-12-2019T16:34:03,SageSaga,"so that was Adventure time, in Savage Worlds Fallout i played an alien"
27-12-2019T16:34:55,omnishade,Im guessing your an alien that crashed in the wasteland after mothership zeta?
27-12-2019T16:35:00,SageSaga,yep
27-12-2019T16:35:26,SageSaga,i modified my space suit to look like armor so i just looked like a weird Midget in a full suit
27-12-2019T16:35:54,TeapotOfDoom,i love that description
27-12-2019T16:35:57,SageSaga,I did crazy tech modifications- even made a collar that let a dog talk
27-12-2019T16:37:46,SageSaga,another game we did an apocalyptic Super Power game - a war between super villains and super heroes ended up almost destroying the planet and most supers got wiped out- so we were a group of super powered refugees trying to find a place to live
27-12-2019T16:38:34,SageSaga,I had shape shifting powers and we ran into some raiders- we got the jump on them so when one went off to take a piss we took him out- i turned into him and ran to his friends screaming
27-12-2019T16:39:10,SageSaga,"and said ""GET OUT OF HERE! SOME KINDA-"" and then i looked at the GM and said ""And now i make it look like my face is melting off"""
27-12-2019T16:39:27,TeapotOfDoom,Holy shit
27-12-2019T16:39:29,SageSaga,"the gm was like O_O... ""You took the fear super power too?"""
27-12-2019T16:39:40,SageSaga,and yes- yes i did...
27-12-2019T16:39:41,TeapotOfDoom,Poor guys
27-12-2019T16:39:52,SageSaga,One of the guys had a heart attack and died right there
27-12-2019T16:39:58,omnishade,HA
27-12-2019T16:40:26,SageSaga,the others dropped everything and ran into the desert
27-12-2019T16:40:51,SageSaga,as i had acted like i had fallen over onto the car they had
27-12-2019T16:41:04,SageSaga,"and once they were gone i got up and yelled back to my friends """
27-12-2019T16:41:10,SageSaga,"""I got a car!"""
27-12-2019T16:41:33,TeapotOfDoom,Wp
27-12-2019T16:41:40,AnuSekaniArt,XD
27-12-2019T16:42:16,TeapotOfDoom,Still poor guys. They were scarred for life after that
27-12-2019T16:42:21,AnuSekaniArt,"Alright I have to head out now, few things to take care of"
27-12-2019T16:42:25,SageSaga,take care
27-12-2019T16:42:27,AnuSekaniArt,"Thanks for streaming Sage, always a pleasure ^^"
27-12-2019T16:42:30,TeapotOfDoom,Bey anu
27-12-2019T16:42:34,AnuSekaniArt,Later Teapot ^^
27-12-2019T16:42:36,TeapotOfDoom,Bye
27-12-2019T16:42:41,AnuSekaniArt,Keep up the great work ^^
27-12-2019T16:42:46,FoxxTrotter,"Bye, Anu."
27-12-2019T16:42:51,AnuSekaniArt,WIll look into Savage Worlds now XP
27-12-2019T16:43:32,SageSaga,Savage Worlds can do just about anything well- and is super easy to learn
27-12-2019T16:44:35,SageSaga,also the only rulebook you absolutely need- is 10 bucks
27-12-2019T16:44:56,TeapotOfDoom,*cough* DND *cough*
27-12-2019T16:46:05,omnishade,"""I cast Darkness into the darkness to make it super darkness"" Gm: Good job,you trip and fall on your face."
27-12-2019T16:46:05,SageSaga,like- if ya want to do Savage Worlds Super Heroes the book is totally worth it- but you can kinda do it without it
27-12-2019T16:47:55,TeapotOfDoom,"I would say nobody would really do that, then again..."
27-12-2019T16:48:39,SageSaga,well all it would do is make it so darkvision doesnt work in the darkness
27-12-2019T16:48:54,SageSaga,oh and make it so even if you take a light in it doesnt help
27-12-2019T16:49:25,omnishade,"True,but imagine someone doing that before the party heads down a flight of stairs...dexterity checks for everyone"
27-12-2019T16:49:45,TeapotOfDoom,Quite uncalled for
27-12-2019T16:49:49,SageSaga,why?
27-12-2019T16:50:07,SageSaga,i go down stairs in the dark all the time- never had to roll a dex check...
27-12-2019T16:50:46,TeapotOfDoom,You get up at night and go for the bathroom on the other floor
27-12-2019T16:51:03,SageSaga,"I'd just go- ""Ok you can just go half your speed down the stairs to prevent any incidents"""
27-12-2019T16:51:07,TeapotOfDoom,Suddenly you hear an almighty sounding voice from the sky
27-12-2019T16:51:21,TeapotOfDoom,"""Make a dexterity saving throw!"""
27-12-2019T16:51:34,omnishade,"""Also,roll initiative"""
27-12-2019T16:51:48,TeapotOfDoom,That escalated quickly
27-12-2019T16:51:59,omnishade,"""The stairs were actually a mimic"""
27-12-2019T16:53:09,TeapotOfDoom,Stairs came to bite your butt
27-12-2019T16:54:03,SageSaga,that reminds me
27-12-2019T16:54:12,SageSaga,i gotta see if that book is any good
27-12-2019T16:54:30,TeapotOfDoom,Which one?
27-12-2019T16:54:30,SageSaga,"theres a book about a Mimic and its called ""Everybody likes big Chests"""
27-12-2019T16:54:43,TeapotOfDoom,That sounds...
27-12-2019T16:54:46,sunblaze,^perfect jsut perfect
27-12-2019T16:55:45,TeapotOfDoom,Well the title is kinda suggestive xD
27-12-2019T16:56:07,omnishade,I have an odd story of how my friends asked me to describe a certain mimic
27-12-2019T16:56:25,TeapotOfDoom,Tell us
27-12-2019T16:57:18,sunblaze,wow that book looks promisingly bad. thanks sage for that. thats gonna sweeten late 2019 for sure
27-12-2019T16:57:36,omnishade,"so my friend asled me: How do I describe a Mimic in the restroom,and my reply was ""If any of your party drop thier pants,Describe the mimic having a very very big grin,a shit eating if you will"""
27-12-2019T16:57:42,omnishade,*Asked
27-12-2019T16:58:12,sunblaze,^thats jsut nasty
27-12-2019T16:58:25,omnishade,"Twas a bad pun,but I had a great laugh"
27-12-2019T16:59:00,SageSaga,I heard the book was surprisingly good- but i dont know if i trust that source
27-12-2019T16:59:09,omnishade,a week later the guy told me the bard was the only victim of that description.
27-12-2019T16:59:19,TeapotOfDoom,Lol
27-12-2019T16:59:22,FoxxTrotter,"I have to head out. Later, everyone. :0)"
27-12-2019T16:59:34,TeapotOfDoom,Bye foxx
27-12-2019T16:59:42,sunblaze,bye foxx
27-12-2019T16:59:49,omnishade,later fox
27-12-2019T17:00:03,SageSaga,bye Foxx
27-12-2019T17:08:24,SageSaga,2 weeks and MHW Iceborne comes out for PC.... so excite
27-12-2019T17:08:35,omnishade,Noice! and I have to ask sage when you do the shading for her do you use a shade of purple?
27-12-2019T17:08:48,RimaDraws,this looks great
27-12-2019T17:09:53,SageSaga,yes- i always try to do shading with a shade either Red or Purple
27-12-2019T17:10:14,omnishade,ooh
27-12-2019T17:11:07,TeapotOfDoom,did you lend that from the red/blue theory in film?
27-12-2019T17:12:34,SageSaga,nah i do it based on the multiply effect and knowing that theres often red tones in skin so just by adding some red hues to skin it often looks more like skin
27-12-2019T17:13:29,SageSaga,also you should pretty much never shade with grey and black for a color picture- it always looks so flat
27-12-2019T17:14:39,RimaDraws,*takes notes*
27-12-2019T17:18:57,TeapotOfDoom,I'm Sage and this is my Masterclass
27-12-2019T17:19:44,SageSaga,I'm Sage and this is my Scrub Class
27-12-2019T17:20:30,SageSaga,"Everything you learn from this course will be pretty basic stuff but some of it will make you go ""oh crap- so thats what ive been doing wrong-"" so its time to get gud scrub!"
27-12-2019T17:21:44,TeapotOfDoom,honestly those are my fav moments in lessons
27-12-2019T17:25:01,RimaDraws,Well guys i am gonna head out so ill see you later! <3

27-12-2019T17:38:59,TeapotOfDoom,going skiing tomorrow
27-12-2019T17:39:05,TeapotOfDoom,first time this year
27-12-2019T17:40:37,SpazztasticKiwi,cat can go from purring in lap to whiny and sour in seconds
27-12-2019T17:41:10,TeapotOfDoom,bagheera is super cat
27-12-2019T17:41:13,TeapotOfDoom,he can do this
27-12-2019T17:42:08,SageSaga,well they say Purring is not always a sign of being relaxed
27-12-2019T17:44:16,SageSaga,they say cats will purr while nervous as a way to try and calm themselves
27-12-2019T17:44:56,SageSaga,"so its possible a cat might be purring and then start whining because ""ITS NOT WORKING! GAAAAAAAAHHH!"""
27-12-2019T17:46:29,SpazztasticKiwi,he was so into that earrub he was almost upside down then he just okthatsenoughFREEME
