05-08-2019T01:51:54,shamdow,"Silly question, how would i be able to get a hold of the side comic magical mishaps and pixie panic in a physical copy?"
05-08-2019T01:56:00,Sclimshady,Tom said he plans to sell them soon
05-08-2019T01:59:25,shamdow,Awsome. In That case. Cheers.
05-08-2019T02:04:42,Bgrmystr2,ffs how does our isp just drop the internet in the middle of the night
05-08-2019T02:05:08,Bgrmystr2,For several hours now..
05-08-2019T02:05:25,Sclimshady,Because they hate happy customers
05-08-2019T02:05:59,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-unimpressed:
05-08-2019T02:06:20,Bgrmystr2,Not happy. Probably as intended.
05-08-2019T02:07:13,Sclimshady,Internet service properly provided
05-08-2019T02:07:41,Bgrmystr2,Whatta load o' shit haha
05-08-2019T02:08:09,SpazztasticKiwi,because it doesn‚Äôt like you that‚Äôs why
05-08-2019T02:08:13,Bgrmystr2,Provided to everyone but the customers
05-08-2019T02:09:10,Sclimshady,As intended
05-08-2019T02:09:25,Bgrmystr2,"To be fair, with a name like Cox Cable, it's any wonder if they like anyone.."
05-08-2019T02:09:39,SpazztasticKiwi,don‚Äôt you know that‚Äôs how you make money
05-08-2019T02:09:52,SpazztasticKiwi,dick cable
05-08-2019T02:09:55,Sclimshady,"Oh, I used to have them. They are terrible"
05-08-2019T02:10:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I bet they‚Äôre hard on their employees
05-08-2019T02:10:21,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-ohmy::ptv-laugh:
05-08-2019T02:10:32,SpazztasticKiwi,no wonder they have performance issues
05-08-2019T02:11:46,SpazztasticKiwi,this is why I can‚Äôt be out in public
05-08-2019T02:12:00,Bgrmystr2,Lolo
05-08-2019T02:13:02,SpazztasticKiwi,ok last one
05-08-2019T02:13:06,Bgrmystr2,Wonder if the amount taken off the bill will equate to how much the data costs on my phone..
05-08-2019T02:13:19,SpazztasticKiwi,it can‚Äôt work if you‚Äôre watching it
05-08-2019T02:13:23,SpazztasticKiwi,that is all
05-08-2019T02:14:10,Bgrmystr2,Does it's best work behind closed doors :ptv-laugh:
05-08-2019T02:14:38,SpazztasticKiwi,maybe it needs a certain atmosphere
05-08-2019T02:15:23,Bgrmystr2,"Sure as hell ain't us. Ironically, it might be a prude."
05-08-2019T02:15:30,SpazztasticKiwi,bow chica wow wow music
05-08-2019T02:15:53,SpazztasticKiwi,oh well of course it‚Äôs a prude
05-08-2019T02:16:11,SpazztasticKiwi,explains why it wants to cover up and hide away
05-08-2019T02:18:35,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs only been an hour but this movie feels like it‚Äôs been going for days
05-08-2019T02:19:09,Bgrmystr2,Whatcha watchin?
05-08-2019T02:19:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Corpse Bride
05-08-2019T02:20:17,SpazztasticKiwi,and maybe if you‚Äôre nice to your internet it will come back
05-08-2019T02:20:28,SpazztasticKiwi,perhaps tis shy not prude
05-08-2019T02:20:57,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve taken to watching a movie or two at night before bed these few days
05-08-2019T02:21:15,Bgrmystr2,"Atm the Cox Network has internet, and the modem sees that, but we get nothing good day sir"
05-08-2019T02:21:39,SpazztasticKiwi,"‚ÄúIt‚Äôs 2 am, I don‚Äôt waaaaaaanna‚Äù"
05-08-2019T02:22:39,SpazztasticKiwi,if you‚Äôre here though how‚Äôs that no internet
05-08-2019T02:24:02,Bgrmystr2,"Phone has data. That's it. One app. If I want to check Discord, I have to leave and go open that app instead."
05-08-2019T02:24:41,SpazztasticKiwi,oh that‚Äôs what I do all the time
05-08-2019T02:24:48,SpazztasticKiwi,who needs computer
05-08-2019T02:25:28,Bgrmystr2,Me. My system uses the internet for lots of things.
05-08-2019T02:25:46,SpazztasticKiwi,what system
05-08-2019T02:26:11,Bgrmystr2,Also phone keyboards suck balls. Srsly it's so bad
05-08-2019T02:26:28,SpazztasticKiwi,I love mine
05-08-2019T02:27:02,Bgrmystr2,Lol my computer.. what other system would I have xD
05-08-2019T02:27:21,SpazztasticKiwi,why call it a computer
05-08-2019T02:27:29,SpazztasticKiwi,*system
05-08-2019T02:27:39,SpazztasticKiwi,‚Äòstead of ‚Äúcomputer‚Äù
05-08-2019T02:27:41,SpazztasticKiwi,nerd
05-08-2019T02:28:28,Bgrmystr2,"Deal with it, I use IT terms. üòé"
05-08-2019T02:29:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I repeat
05-08-2019T02:29:03,SpazztasticKiwi,NERD
05-08-2019T02:29:44,Bgrmystr2,Is that a problem?
05-08-2019T02:29:50,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-condescending:
05-08-2019T02:30:05,SpazztasticKiwi,not really I don‚Äôt suppose
05-08-2019T02:30:18,SpazztasticKiwi,you‚Äôre useful I guess
05-08-2019T02:30:32,SpazztasticKiwi,other than that I‚Äôd be lost in most conversations
05-08-2019T02:31:17,SpazztasticKiwi,since apparently you‚Äôve shown to watch few common movies
05-08-2019T02:33:13,Bgrmystr2,"Lol don't ask some of the others in the chat, I'd question if some of them have any experience in IT at all. Coding not withstanding of course lol"
05-08-2019T02:33:54,Bgrmystr2,They'd tell you I'm useless.
05-08-2019T02:35:40,Bgrmystr2,"ohey, internet came back"
05-08-2019T02:35:46,Bgrmystr2,only took it 2 1/2 hrs
05-08-2019T02:35:52,SpazztasticKiwi,as a good rule I can look at things myself and use that new free thing called google
05-08-2019T02:36:14,SpazztasticKiwi,other than that I may tap a friend or relative that knows better
05-08-2019T02:37:15,SpazztasticKiwi,I try to avoid professional help with tech cause they‚Äôll just flip a setting that knocked everything out of balance and bill $65
05-08-2019T02:37:24,Bgrmystr2,"Unlike some people who come and go, I don't think I know everything, nor do I claim or imply it. If you dunno somethin, look it up."
05-08-2019T02:37:45,Bgrmystr2,"most ""professionals"" that overcharge like that are just out for money, not to actually fix shit"
05-08-2019T02:37:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"hey google, is my laptop supposed to growl at me"
05-08-2019T02:38:04,Bgrmystr2,you can tell the ones who actually care cuz they won't charge you for something that's miniscule.
05-08-2019T02:38:26,SpazztasticKiwi,possession? Ah ok I‚Äôll just....üî®
05-08-2019T02:40:15,SpazztasticKiwi,like when my microphone setting got swapped from laptop to plug in/external device or whatever tf you want to call it
05-08-2019T02:40:17,SpazztasticKiwi,google
05-08-2019T02:40:21,SpazztasticKiwi,fixed it
05-08-2019T02:41:27,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs definitely a perfect skill for now with what it brings in and how good it is to have for yourself
05-08-2019T02:43:52,Bgrmystr2,"learning more and then being able to fix more is a good thing, but eventually it'll get to the point where you know enough to fix minor and a few major problems.. but don't know enough for everything else that you've unintentionally caused by meandering"
05-08-2019T02:44:29,Bgrmystr2,"and the more stuff you know how to fix, the more shit you don't know can affect you."
05-08-2019T03:06:54,CrimsonQuill,Morning
05-08-2019T04:39:12,Mikemkke034,^^

05-08-2019T05:57:53,CrimsonQuill,"Aww, Caboose."
05-08-2019T05:57:55,CrimsonQuill,My boy.
05-08-2019T05:58:01,CrimsonQuill,I have a talking plushie of him.
05-08-2019T05:58:23,CrimsonQuill,"(I should actually get around to showing my siblings seasons 3-9, it's been ages.)"
05-08-2019T05:59:15,SniperJackal,"Or should we say, pvt O`Maley or whatever"
05-08-2019T06:07:11,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-natsducky:
05-08-2019T06:19:54,SniperJackal,Anyways im currently on episode 29
05-08-2019T06:20:23,SniperJackal,And Sheila and Lopez fell in love xd
05-08-2019T06:20:28,CrimsonQuill,Just after we get the taste of Oblivion?
05-08-2019T06:20:37,CrimsonQuill,@TerraTheWizard Hullo
05-08-2019T06:20:53,CrimsonQuill,@SniperJackal it is sweet...though I think she still likes Caboose.
05-08-2019T06:21:07,CrimsonQuill,No spoilers for those who haven't watched it anyhow.
05-08-2019T06:21:23,SniperJackal,^^
05-08-2019T06:22:24,SniperJackal,The best moment was when tucker flipped Lopez s 'switch'
05-08-2019T06:22:42,CrimsonQuill,Oh God no...
05-08-2019T06:23:00,SniperJackal,Hey baby you from around here XD
05-08-2019T06:23:08,CrimsonQuill,"My brother couldn't understand why it was so taboo...and then when I told him why, he couldn't stop laughing."
05-08-2019T06:23:15,CrimsonQuill,Bow chicka Bow wow.
05-08-2019T06:24:46,SniperJackal,Anyways
05-08-2019T06:25:00,SniperJackal,Season 2 is much better
05-08-2019T06:25:31,CrimsonQuill,I still think that one of the top moment's is Donut's really good arm.
05-08-2019T06:25:41,CrimsonQuill,And the Six pedals.
05-08-2019T06:25:43,SniperJackal,Oh crap
05-08-2019T06:25:47,CrimsonQuill,But Season 2.... :D
05-08-2019T06:25:57,CrimsonQuill,@SniperJackal what happened?
05-08-2019T06:26:12,SniperJackal,I was quoting tex
05-08-2019T06:26:21,CrimsonQuill,Oh shoot
05-08-2019T06:26:27,CrimsonQuill,Forgetting my own quotes now
05-08-2019T06:26:30,CrimsonQuill,Dammit
05-08-2019T06:26:35,CrimsonQuill,"Well, three points."
05-08-2019T06:26:41,SniperJackal,Or when doc rams sarge 2 times
05-08-2019T06:26:54,CrimsonQuill,'Should I do it again?'
05-08-2019T06:26:56,SniperJackal,Oops wrong pedal
05-08-2019T06:26:56,CrimsonQuill,'NO.'
05-08-2019T06:26:59,CrimsonQuill,XD
05-08-2019T06:27:24,CrimsonQuill,'Wait! Stop! Go back! Why are there six pedals if there are only four directions?2
05-08-2019T06:27:26,CrimsonQuill,'
05-08-2019T06:27:39,SniperJackal,Or when tucker calls him a pussyfest
05-08-2019T06:27:46,CrimsonQuill,...
05-08-2019T06:27:57,CrimsonQuill,Kinda thin ice on the language front.
05-08-2019T06:28:01,SniperJackal,Its pacifist dumbass
05-08-2019T06:28:17,CrimsonQuill,'Ok...but I don't think it'll stick.'
05-08-2019T06:28:19,CrimsonQuill,DOC
05-08-2019T06:28:25,CrimsonQuill,*cue music*
05-08-2019T06:28:38,SniperJackal,:D

05-08-2019T06:29:01,CrimsonQuill,'D R I V E'
05-08-2019T06:29:12,CrimsonQuill,Dammit sarge and your passcodes.
05-08-2019T06:30:37,SniperJackal,Oh and what do you mean thin ice
05-08-2019T06:30:51,SniperJackal,Pussy isnt exactly a bad word
05-08-2019T06:30:58,CrimsonQuill,Connotations
05-08-2019T06:31:06,SniperJackal,Oh
05-08-2019T06:31:18,CrimsonQuill,"Yeah, the internet really can be nasty with words"
05-08-2019T06:31:25,SniperJackal,Hahah
05-08-2019T06:31:29,CrimsonQuill,I wish I didn't know it
05-08-2019T06:31:31,CrimsonQuill,But I do
05-08-2019T06:47:15,CrRAR,"I don't know if seagulls can scream, but that sure sounds like what this bird outside here is doing."
05-08-2019T06:47:23,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-reniderp:
05-08-2019T06:47:42,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-SteelwormHades: Mine?
05-08-2019T06:47:58,CrRAR,haha
05-08-2019T06:48:06,CrimsonQuill,"Hello CrRAR, Hello Bgrmystr2"
05-08-2019T06:48:16,CrRAR,Hello crimson
05-08-2019T06:49:14,CrRAR,It sounds more drawn out than your typical 'mine' honk.
05-08-2019T06:50:18,CrRAR,:thinking: The Screaming Seagull sounds like a good name for a harbortown bar or tavern or something.
05-08-2019T06:52:43,CrimsonQuill,Got to go
05-08-2019T06:52:44,CrimsonQuill,Lunch
05-08-2019T06:53:28,CrimsonQuill,Cya
05-08-2019T07:52:47,Mikemkke034,Morning gang
05-08-2019T08:11:26,SomeNiceUser,Hello everyone.
05-08-2019T08:13:48,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-nibsbounce:
05-08-2019T08:14:28,Mikemkke034,How is everyone
05-08-2019T08:20:36,SomeNiceUser,Pretty good.
05-08-2019T08:28:15,CrimsonQuill,Fine thanks
05-08-2019T09:03:16,SomeNiceUser,Ima go make a sprint. Just because I want to.
05-08-2019T09:27:53,CrimsonQuill,:)
05-08-2019T09:41:55,AspiringNoodle,*impatient noodle noises*
05-08-2019T09:45:58,CrimsonQuill,Hello Noodle.
05-08-2019T09:49:11,AspiringNoodle,I'm about to buy some 3200 CL14 memory and call it a day
05-08-2019T09:49:21,AspiringNoodle,Tired of waiting for G.skill's damned Neo memory to launch -_-
05-08-2019T09:51:58,Mikemkke034,Lol
05-08-2019T09:55:41,AspiringNoodle,It's just annoying
05-08-2019T09:55:47,AspiringNoodle,The product listing's been up for like a week
05-08-2019T09:56:04,AspiringNoodle,They've launched lower-end skus for the new line
05-08-2019T09:56:18,CrimsonQuill,XD
05-08-2019T09:56:41,AspiringNoodle,"But even though the supplies of older ram have been exhausted, they haven't really put out new stuff"
05-08-2019T09:57:15,AspiringNoodle,"Hold on, there was an ASUS meme that fits this situation"
05-08-2019T10:01:50,AspiringNoodle,Can't find it
05-08-2019T10:08:21,Mikemkke034,That sucks
05-08-2019T10:24:48,AspiringNoodle,"Man, every time I think about buying ASUS products"
05-08-2019T10:25:01,AspiringNoodle,I get reminded that they are legendary for their horrible customer support xD
05-08-2019T10:25:20,AspiringNoodle,"Every company has horror stories, but ASUS is special in that they are far more numerous :P"
05-08-2019T10:25:37,AspiringNoodle,"Btw, totally recommend ViewSonic if you ever need to RMA something~"
05-08-2019T10:26:48,AspiringNoodle,"My first monitor had a strip on the left side that was slightly discolored under certain circumstances, and could sometimes flicker"
05-08-2019T10:27:40,AspiringNoodle,I drove myself mad trying to prove to CS that it was faulty.  Luckily an indie game had a particular spot that caused the strip to freak the frick out.  It flickered so badly that I could capture it on my phone and it would be clear to anyone.
05-08-2019T10:28:50,Mikemkke034,"Wow, that's pretty crazy"
05-08-2019T10:29:11,AspiringNoodle,"While I did have to pay for shipping the first time around, when my monitor came back and was broken (small section of frame broken, panel damaged, nice little colored spider web when I turned it on xD)"
05-08-2019T10:29:48,AspiringNoodle,"When I reported the damage to CS, within 30 minutes I had a return shipping label, and I was sent a brand new monitor super fast"
05-08-2019T10:29:50,AspiringNoodle,"Same model, too"
05-08-2019T10:30:34,Mikemkke034,"I can just imagine their CS finding this out: ""We just sent this person a new monitor. Turns out it was broken too!"""
05-08-2019T10:30:34,AspiringNoodle,"While I was understandly frustrated / upset with the broken return, the new one made me veeeeeeeeery happy."
05-08-2019T10:30:42,AspiringNoodle,Oh god
05-08-2019T10:30:45,AspiringNoodle,That would be a nightmare!
05-08-2019T10:30:46,Mikemkke034,Yeah
05-08-2019T10:31:14,AspiringNoodle,"Tbh, small details are my kinda thing"
05-08-2019T10:31:18,AspiringNoodle,"And this was that, a small detail"
05-08-2019T10:31:34,Mikemkke034,But that can be both positive and negative
05-08-2019T10:31:41,AspiringNoodle,"You could call it a shadow, but it was very picky about when it was visible"
05-08-2019T10:31:57,AspiringNoodle,"The flickering, though, that was more noticeable when it did happen"
05-08-2019T10:32:09,Mikemkke034,And not the greatest for your eyes either
05-08-2019T10:32:10,AspiringNoodle,And the flickering is what made the defect more apparent
05-08-2019T10:32:20,AspiringNoodle,"I'm not sure what the issue was, either"
05-08-2019T10:32:33,AspiringNoodle,It's like it couldn't supply light correctly
05-08-2019T10:32:53,AspiringNoodle,It's worth mentioning that the shape changed over time
05-08-2019T10:33:06,AspiringNoodle,So those three things together made me go ahead with an rma
05-08-2019T10:33:30,AspiringNoodle,"This panel is near perfect, too"
05-08-2019T10:34:05,Mikemkke034,My previous monitor (Have yet to get a new one) ended up not being produced anymore. The power supply stopped working (Replaced it). Turns out the port in which you connect the PSU to the monitor was fried
05-08-2019T10:34:47,AspiringNoodle,"I'd argue that the backlight bleed is better than the original, and while it does have some dim pixels, they're pretty hard to notice, and are more likely to be confused with dust than anything else"
05-08-2019T10:35:42,Mikemkke034,I'd rather that than spiderwebbing and constant flickering
05-08-2019T10:35:44,Mikemkke034,Y'know
05-08-2019T10:36:10,AspiringNoodle,The flickering only happened during loading screens in WoW and during gameplay in that ONE indie title
05-08-2019T10:36:21,AspiringNoodle,But it was enough for me to be convinced it was a problem worth fixing :)
05-08-2019T10:36:42,Mikemkke034,At least you ended up doing just that
05-08-2019T10:37:25,AspiringNoodle,"Btw, can confirm, larger area vs concentrated discoloration is more bearable when it comes to blb ;)"
05-08-2019T10:38:01,AspiringNoodle,"This monitor seems to have more backlight bleed than the original, but the original had pretty serious (relatively speaking) bleed in the lower right corner"
05-08-2019T10:38:15,AspiringNoodle,It could discolor very dark scenes
05-08-2019T10:38:38,Mikemkke034,Wow
05-08-2019T10:38:56,AspiringNoodle,"Eh, it comes with the territory"
05-08-2019T10:39:19,AspiringNoodle,"Until the pixels themselves emit the light, it's just an unfortunate consequence"
05-08-2019T10:39:35,Mikemkke034,It'll come one day
05-08-2019T10:40:18,AspiringNoodle,"Anywho, consider me a fan of ViewSonic"
05-08-2019T10:40:27,AspiringNoodle,They also have a very generous defective pixel policy
05-08-2019T10:40:38,Mikemkke034,That's great
05-08-2019T10:40:51,AspiringNoodle,"Last I checked, all the matters is pixel count.  Density / screen section does not apply"
05-08-2019T10:42:34,AspiringNoodle,"Btw, did you know that ASUS CS has its own subreddit?"
05-08-2019T10:42:45,Mikemkke034,No I didn't
05-08-2019T10:42:50,AspiringNoodle,r/Asused
05-08-2019T10:42:55,Mikemkke034,Hmm
05-08-2019T10:42:57,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-snicker:
05-08-2019T10:43:10,Mikemkke034,May have to check it out
05-08-2019T10:43:26,AspiringNoodle,"I am now convinced that if you want ASUS products, make sure the website / retailer has to deal with it"
05-08-2019T10:43:50,Mikemkke034,Seems like a plan
05-08-2019T10:56:07,AspiringNoodle,"Gonna do some more research, then order today"
05-08-2019T10:56:21,AspiringNoodle,I am probably just going to get the 3200 CL14 memory
05-08-2019T10:58:38,Mikemkke034,You do you man
05-08-2019T11:01:22,NibblyBot,New Patreon Post: Hotspring Spot https://www.patreon.com/posts/hotspring-spot-28942815
05-08-2019T11:03:21,AspiringNoodle,And no Maeve to ruin the moment :3
05-08-2019T11:03:53,AspiringNoodle,"Also, this article by techpowerup shows something interesting: https://www.techpowerup.com/review/amd-zen-2-memory-performance-scaling-benchmark/3.html"
05-08-2019T11:04:08,AspiringNoodle,3600 C17 is neck and neck with 3200 C14
05-08-2019T11:04:28,AspiringNoodle,Makes me think that even 3600 with 16-19-19-39 timings might be as good at 16-16-16-36
05-08-2019T11:05:04,Mikemkke034,Might be
05-08-2019T11:13:55,AspiringNoodle,"Mike, never get obsessed with hardware like I am unless you plan on starting a (successful) tech channel xD"
05-08-2019T11:14:04,AspiringNoodle,Because you will be disappointed with some benchmarkers
05-08-2019T11:19:13,Mikemkke034,"I was at one point, but nowadays its just with things like gameplay and whether or not everything works. Lol"
05-08-2019T11:22:31,AspiringNoodle,What's really annoying is when I look at benchmarks and two separate things trade blows
05-08-2019T11:22:55,AspiringNoodle,"3200 CL14 vs 3600 CL16 is a case of they tend to trade blows.  Sometimes they're the same, sometimes one is better over the other"
05-08-2019T11:23:39,AspiringNoodle,"At which point you have to look at aggregate across all tests and say, ""Which of these is better most of the time, or, when it does perform better, by how much?"""
05-08-2019T11:34:46,Mikemkke034,Yeah
05-08-2019T11:36:26,AspiringNoodle,For an extra $240 I can get my 3600 CL16 memory today :D
05-08-2019T11:36:32,AspiringNoodle,"And also buy an extra 32GB, lol"
05-08-2019T11:39:42,Mikemkke034,Lol
05-08-2019T11:41:52,AspiringNoodle,I wonder if it's coming in stock today
05-08-2019T11:41:58,Mikemkke034,Hmmm
05-08-2019T11:42:05,AspiringNoodle,A lot of higher-end neo stuff came in stock within the past 2 hours
05-08-2019T11:42:55,AspiringNoodle,"And by that, I mean 2 separate kits of 64GB(4 x 16GB)"
05-08-2019T11:43:05,AspiringNoodle,16-19-19-39 and 16-16-16-36
05-08-2019T11:43:22,Mikemkke034,Which one are you thinking is better?
05-08-2019T11:44:08,AspiringNoodle,latter
05-08-2019T11:53:01,Mikemkke034,Go for that then
05-08-2019T11:56:59,AspiringNoodle,we'll see
05-08-2019T11:57:03,AspiringNoodle,"Ima take a nap, lol"
05-08-2019T11:58:08,Mikemkke034,"Alright, I'll talk to ya ltr"

05-08-2019T15:23:23,Mikemkke034,Yeah
05-08-2019T15:23:32,Mikemkke034,EST
05-08-2019T15:34:49,SniperJackal,If only the entire world would have the same time
05-08-2019T15:35:34,Mikemkke034,That would be 100% more efficient for everything :joy:
05-08-2019T15:38:38,SniperJackal,I have a feeling that was sarcasm
05-08-2019T15:38:40,SniperJackal,hahah
05-08-2019T15:40:00,Mikemkke034,Im not too sure myself. Oof
05-08-2019T15:45:03,tehbear,things that were normally scheduled for whole hours will be all over the place
05-08-2019T15:45:49,SniperJackal,true
05-08-2019T15:46:24,Mikemkke034,Yeah
05-08-2019T15:46:24,tehbear,"unless we start shifting them around, and then were back to the same issue for many things"
05-08-2019T15:46:34,CrimsonQuill,Goodnight
05-08-2019T15:46:39,tehbear,night!
05-08-2019T15:46:51,Mikemkke034,Night mate
05-08-2019T15:47:02,SniperJackal,night
05-08-2019T15:47:23,tehbear,maybe timezones are just a way for the simulation that runs life on earth enough processing power
05-08-2019T15:47:43,Mikemkke034,That is a wonderful way to look at it!
05-08-2019T15:49:41,tehbear,DST - not daylight saving time but dataprocessing saving time
05-08-2019T15:50:05,Mikemkke034,Lol
05-08-2019T15:53:02,SniperJackal,I think DST will be no more in Europe
05-08-2019T15:53:07,SniperJackal,but im not sure
05-08-2019T15:53:35,AspiringNoodle,I love Youtube
05-08-2019T15:54:00,AspiringNoodle,"Just watched Louis Rossman spend 9.5 minutes telling all his viewers, customers, and anyone else who gives a shit, ""I told you so"""
05-08-2019T15:54:11,AspiringNoodle,So entertaining <4
05-08-2019T15:54:13,AspiringNoodle,<3
05-08-2019T15:54:18,Mikemkke034,Oof
05-08-2019T15:54:58,AspiringNoodle,"Well, what do you expect?  His businesses thrives on doing board-level repairs for crApple products"
05-08-2019T15:55:07,AspiringNoodle,And crApple have finally done it
05-08-2019T15:55:32,AspiringNoodle,They've made a motherboard with an unrepairable part.
05-08-2019T15:55:37,Mikemkke034,Figures :grin:
05-08-2019T15:56:01,AspiringNoodle,Their new laptops have a T2 chip that is literally unreplaceable
05-08-2019T15:56:17,AspiringNoodle,"It's pulling doubletime, too, and doing the work that used to be delegated to 2 chips"
05-08-2019T15:56:39,Mikemkke034,Wow
05-08-2019T15:57:04,AspiringNoodle,"And apparently these chips have programming that is board specific, so if it dies, there's nothing you can do but buy a new board.  And since there is NO data recovery possibilities with this board, if that chip goes, you better have backed up your shit :"
05-08-2019T15:57:05,AspiringNoodle,:D
05-08-2019T15:57:36,AspiringNoodle,"#FuckApple, #IHaveNoSympathyForFanboys"
05-08-2019T15:58:32,AspiringNoodle,"Best part?  This laptop is 3 months old, and Apple said the warranty wasn't valid because of liquid damage.  Well Louis gave us a REEEEAAAAAAAL close look at that board all over the place, and with a microscope."
05-08-2019T15:58:48,AspiringNoodle,"Dunno bout anyone else, but I didn't see no liquid damage. :ptv-condescending:"

05-08-2019T15:59:55,SniperJackal,we can see
05-08-2019T15:59:59,SniperJackal,and you love tech
05-08-2019T16:00:16,AspiringNoodle,"I've long hated Apple because of marketing, price, and the general behavior some apple users have"
05-08-2019T16:00:26,AspiringNoodle,He just gave me more legitimate reasons to hate them ;D
05-08-2019T16:00:31,SniperJackal,yeah apple is....special
05-08-2019T16:00:41,SniperJackal,but people still buy it so they make stonks
05-08-2019T16:01:05,AspiringNoodle,There's a sick twisted part of me that wants them to buy more and more
05-08-2019T16:01:16,tehbear,you got stonks?
05-08-2019T16:01:37,AspiringNoodle,"Just so when Apple's abuse gets so bad, they finally realize how many 10's of thousands of dollars they've wasted on this unethical, shady, and abusive company"
05-08-2019T16:01:51,SniperJackal,atm got no stonks
05-08-2019T16:02:30,AspiringNoodle,"Apple is perfect, tbh"
05-08-2019T16:02:51,SniperJackal,perfect money making machine
05-08-2019T16:02:59,AspiringNoodle,Most people are tech illiterate to the point that they think replacing a single component in a computer equating to half to full price is perfectly reasonable
05-08-2019T16:03:27,AspiringNoodle,"LTT had a video where they borked thier iMac Pro (and they admitted fault to), and the Apple fanbois were quick to defend their beloved company"
05-08-2019T16:03:33,SniperJackal,in a way they re smart since they know that people are stupid enough to buy it
05-08-2019T16:03:56,AspiringNoodle,I'll bbl
05-08-2019T16:05:23,tehbear,"doesnt matter how bad Apple is, as long owning a device is seen as a status symbol people will want them"
05-08-2019T16:17:00,Mikemkke034,Fair enough
05-08-2019T16:17:48,tehbear,i wonder what gadget will replace the smartphone
05-08-2019T16:20:33,Mikemkke034,Hmmm
05-08-2019T16:20:44,TerraTheWizard,elon's neural implant thing
05-08-2019T16:20:53,SniperJackal,oh yeah
05-08-2019T16:21:03,SniperJackal,elon wants to get us into minecraft
05-08-2019T16:21:05,SniperJackal,or smth
05-08-2019T16:21:08,TerraTheWizard,lol
05-08-2019T16:21:20,SniperJackal,I mean he had a speech
05-08-2019T16:21:54,Mikemkke034,"Maybe everything will be replaced by ""Smart Glasses"" and ""Smart Contacts"""
05-08-2019T16:22:02,tehbear,like the eyePhone in Futurama
05-08-2019T16:22:04,Mikemkke034,Much like in a book I read awhile back
05-08-2019T16:22:23,SniperJackal,I feel like thats a bit much
05-08-2019T16:23:21,Mikemkke034,Not necessarily
05-08-2019T16:23:48,SniperJackal,I mean not that we cant do it
05-08-2019T16:23:53,SniperJackal,we can
05-08-2019T16:24:00,Mikemkke034,It's just that people don't want to
05-08-2019T16:24:18,Mikemkke034,"Or at least, the governments globally don't want them to"
05-08-2019T16:24:20,SniperJackal,but I feel like we shouldnt go too far with this kind of technology
05-08-2019T16:24:37,Mikemkke034,Why? It'd take life to a whole new level
05-08-2019T16:28:22,tehbear,just dont connect it to the internet and you will be fine :P
05-08-2019T16:30:52,Mikemkke034,"I believe that it should be there to assist in everyday life, like allowing you to look at a recipe while cooking (Using both hands)"
05-08-2019T16:30:58,Mikemkke034,Or other things
05-08-2019T16:35:43,tehbear,or when you need even more hands
05-08-2019T16:35:58,tehbear,attach some robotic arms with hands and control them with your mind
05-08-2019T16:35:58,Mikemkke034,True
05-08-2019T16:36:21,Mikemkke034,"Or, in a less practical way, but related as to why we're all here"
05-08-2019T16:36:45,tehbear,?
05-08-2019T16:36:47,Mikemkke034,The ability to watch things while doing anything else (Except driving)
05-08-2019T16:37:00,Mikemkke034,Like Tom's livestreams. Lmao
05-08-2019T16:38:26,tehbear,hehe. but i mostly need that feature for driving :P
05-08-2019T16:38:44,Mikemkke034,"Well, it could be used as sort of a H.U.D"
05-08-2019T16:39:05,Mikemkke034,Like GPS in your peripheral
05-08-2019T16:39:26,tehbear,now were talking. terminator vision
05-08-2019T16:39:32,Mikemkke034,Yes!
05-08-2019T16:40:14,Mikemkke034,Then you could use Waypoints irl
05-08-2019T16:40:27,Mikemkke034,places waypoint at home. Goes to work
05-08-2019T16:40:46,Mikemkke034,Home: 10.27 mi
05-08-2019T16:40:59,Mikemkke034,(Disclaimer: Not actual distance)
05-08-2019T16:41:06,tehbear,i prefer living in hardmode. waypoints distract me from the scenery
05-08-2019T16:41:31,Mikemkke034,Hmm
05-08-2019T16:41:47,Mikemkke034,You could have a steps tracker
05-08-2019T16:41:48,tehbear,how will i otherwise discover all the optional sidequests!?
05-08-2019T16:42:10,Mikemkke034,Such as the homeless shelter on 34th that you could donate to?
05-08-2019T16:42:11,Mikemkke034,Lol
05-08-2019T16:43:03,tehbear,gotta keep the karma meter on the right side of good/evil
05-08-2019T16:43:23,Mikemkke034,"Mine is a little in the red, but that's okay"
05-08-2019T16:43:35,Mikemkke034,"No ""insta-hostiles"" around"
05-08-2019T17:00:50,tehbear,time for me to log out and save some cycles for the sunny side
05-08-2019T17:01:13,Mikemkke034,That saying you're leaving?
05-08-2019T17:01:29,tehbear,yep. cya around !
05-08-2019T17:01:39,Mikemkke034,Cheers mah dude

05-08-2019T21:48:54,SpazztasticKiwi,it was a piece that fell out of my burger
05-08-2019T21:49:25,Bgrmystr2,cats are probably not afraid of a slice since it looks nothing like a snake.
05-08-2019T21:49:31,Mikemkke034,Lol
05-08-2019T21:49:38,Bgrmystr2,unlike a full pickle which is round and shaped similarly to snakes.
05-08-2019T21:49:47,Ordithus,Short snake
05-08-2019T21:49:51,Bgrmystr2,yeah
05-08-2019T21:49:57,Sclimshady,Have you never seel the flat round snakes?
05-08-2019T21:50:02,Sclimshady,Seen
05-08-2019T21:50:16,Bgrmystr2,"it's small, roundish, green, and out the corner of their eye, it's a fuzzy thing that could be absolute danger"
05-08-2019T21:50:22,Bgrmystr2,it's no wonder they go into flight mode.
05-08-2019T21:50:44,Ordithus,But they go nuts attacking snake-like toys
05-08-2019T21:51:26,Sclimshady,Conclusion: cats be weird
05-08-2019T21:51:37,Ordithus,One of my cats as a kid was afraid of bananas.  She was cute.
05-08-2019T21:51:39,Mikemkke034,Lol

05-08-2019T22:35:41,Mikemkke034,Where'd that come from
05-08-2019T22:36:13,CrRAR,"Pickles, burgers, cats, it all makes sense"
05-08-2019T22:36:21,Mikemkke034,Somewhat
05-08-2019T22:36:47,Ordithus,Your logic is spurious :ctwokinds-reniderp_flip:

05-08-2019T23:47:56,SpazztasticKiwi,all I wanted was to find where he got that shirt
05-08-2019T23:48:03,SpazztasticKiwi,then he made it weird
05-08-2019T23:48:34,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúI‚Äôm so hot‚Äù ‚Äúand I might be gay now‚Äù
