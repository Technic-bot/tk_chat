20-02-2019T00:10:00,TorqueEmUp,"Ahh yes, I saw that a couple nights ago too Dadro."
20-02-2019T00:10:52,TorqueEmUp,"I honestly was expecting another ""Taken"" like movie where Liam Neeson brutally kills people in revenge. While we got some of that, I wasn't expecting the humor."
20-02-2019T00:12:19,CrRAR,Yeah movies (and entertainment in general) have been getting oddly gory lately.
20-02-2019T00:13:23,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I had no idea that it was going to be a ""comedy"". It was just kind of a spur of the moment thing. Thought the same thing that it was just going to be another Taken."
20-02-2019T00:13:58,Dadrobit,"Hadn't even seen a trailer, just knew it was a Liam Neeson revenge movie."
20-02-2019T00:15:36,TorqueEmUp,"Mhmm, here. found it when looking for other movies that were coming up and saw it."
20-02-2019T00:15:54,TorqueEmUp,"Friend originally wanted to go see Alita, and I was like. ""Bleh..."""
20-02-2019T00:16:04,TorqueEmUp,I can't get past those ugly CG eyes.
20-02-2019T00:16:05,CrRAR,Neeson rarely EVER disappoints.
20-02-2019T00:16:27,CrRAR,Yeah I cringed when I saw that trailer lol
20-02-2019T00:16:54,TorqueEmUp,I'd have probably seen it if it wasn't for those eyes. But they completely turned me off to seeing the movie entirely.
20-02-2019T00:17:12,TorqueEmUp,"Not to mention it's another ""You're special, you are the key to everything."" movies."
20-02-2019T00:19:10,TorqueEmUp,I was just wanting to see Neesom kick some ass instead. XD
20-02-2019T00:19:22,TorqueEmUp,Neeson*
20-02-2019T00:19:23,CrRAR,Good call
20-02-2019T00:20:21,Bgrmystr2,"Honestly, I don't understand the big fuss about the eyes. Yeah they're strange, but you're gonna let that one thing push you away from seeing it?"
20-02-2019T00:20:23,Dadrobit,The ending with the para-glider fuckin' killed me. Actually couldn't breathe from laughing.
20-02-2019T00:24:17,CrRAR,"Eh, might see it eventually. It‚Äôs just one of those hollywood cookiecutter effects at this point though. I think the chinzy feeling of the effect is its worst enemy."
20-02-2019T00:25:40,CrRAR,I think they first used it back in the JJAbrams Star Trek for an alien girl or something.
20-02-2019T00:26:12,CrRAR,So I would just think of that the whole dang time.
20-02-2019T00:26:38,CrRAR,*Alien dude shows up*

20-02-2019T00:33:20,SpazztasticKiwi,You think the coin press in TK is run by something like a water wheel power or they hire people to hand press a few at a time to make them
20-02-2019T00:35:01,CrRAR,I‚Äôm sure they just employ plenty of dragons with coin-stamping shoes.
20-02-2019T00:35:29,CrRAR,Why do you think dragon-labor is so valuable!?
20-02-2019T00:35:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Are you calling dragons fat

20-02-2019T00:39:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe I should paint the coin brown then
20-02-2019T00:39:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Not gold

20-02-2019T02:27:16,Twokinds,I am asleep

20-02-2019T02:28:10,Twokinds,Saria is a lion. Maren is a black cat. Flora is a Tiger.

20-02-2019T02:28:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Makes sense
20-02-2019T02:29:06,SpazztasticKiwi,And hey Tom. You‚Äôre supposed to be asleep
20-02-2019T02:29:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Sleep typing is a serious thing
20-02-2019T02:29:20,iliar,Nora... often a cat
20-02-2019T02:29:25,Twokinds,It's true.
20-02-2019T02:29:38,Bgrmystr2,yeah nora's a cat too
20-02-2019T02:30:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Getting some late night brainstorming in. Nice.
20-02-2019T02:31:58,Twokinds,I wonder what Reni's animal form would be.
20-02-2019T02:32:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Bunny
20-02-2019T02:32:58,Twokinds,I mean all dragons in the Twokinds universe can shapeshift into most animals. But they all have favorites.
20-02-2019T02:33:44,Twokinds,It'd have to be something black
20-02-2019T02:33:47,Twokinds,Perhaps just a black cat
20-02-2019T02:34:31,Twokinds,"Or maybe a black dog. Although, for Reni dog doesn't really feel suitable to her personality."
20-02-2019T02:35:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Ever seen a black palm cockatoo
20-02-2019T02:35:51,Twokinds,no
20-02-2019T02:35:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Google it
20-02-2019T02:36:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Though the males are often the scary looking ones
20-02-2019T02:36:42,Twokinds,That's neat
20-02-2019T02:37:12,SpazztasticKiwi,First time I saw one it was ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not a bird it‚Äôs an omen of death‚Äù
20-02-2019T02:38:32,Bgrmystr2,there's one of those birds with like.. the death glare
20-02-2019T02:38:36,Bgrmystr2,that thing is evil
20-02-2019T02:38:53,Bgrmystr2,but it's not the one you're talkin about\
20-02-2019T02:39:22,Bgrmystr2,the shoebill. that thing is what I'd call an omen of death
20-02-2019T02:39:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah they‚Äôre quite the nope too
20-02-2019T02:39:53,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm not a fan of birds in general unless it‚Äôs a quick encounter
20-02-2019T02:40:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Except geese
20-02-2019T02:40:09,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt like geese
20-02-2019T02:40:24,SpazztasticKiwi,going near them that is
20-02-2019T02:41:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Pet birds are cool in theory for the most part but you‚Äôll learn having them is like a houseful of yappy little dogs
20-02-2019T02:41:49,SpazztasticKiwi,So. Much. Screaming. My sister had 6 cockatiels at one time
20-02-2019T02:48:17,Twokinds,Yes I cannot stand noise
20-02-2019T02:48:24,Twokinds,So I could never have a bird
20-02-2019T02:49:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I like my peace and quiet more after that
20-02-2019T02:49:49,SpazztasticKiwi,And it increases each day I experience a kid screaming through the store at work
20-02-2019T02:51:05,iliar,About dragons. I like how AntroReni turned out.
20-02-2019T02:51:11,Twokinds,Thanks
20-02-2019T02:51:37,Twokinds,It's kinda weird to draw her like that.
20-02-2019T02:52:59,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs weird for her to be like that. Nora‚Äôs not shown to be used to it
20-02-2019T02:55:32,SpazztasticKiwi,I should be going to bed
20-02-2019T02:56:43,iliar,"Yes, it is weird, but interesting. I mean this is not the best form, but it turned out well and it was interesting to look at her in this form."
20-02-2019T02:57:14,Twokinds,Time to try for bed again.

20-02-2019T17:36:14,Bgrmystr2,lol Mippy you say that like the 11 spice thing has any kind of legitimacy and isn't 100% marketing
20-02-2019T17:40:32,TerraTheWizard,"nice, just noticed we hit 600 sunday sketches"
20-02-2019T17:40:50,TerraTheWizard,less nice i noticed i have an error in my points count
20-02-2019T17:49:44,Mippy,XD but seriously it had no flavour. It‚Äôs like they just dipped it in flour and tossed it in the fryer. No seasoning at all.
20-02-2019T17:51:34,Mippy,"Got to work...was listening to My Chemical Romance (because I‚Äôm 10 years late), took off my headphones and it‚Äôs like culture shock...my co workers have some sort of Filipino pop going"

20-02-2019T21:18:55,Dadrobit,"Nah, Phoenix is just getting drenched at the moment. But it's sure as shit all gonna be iced over real soon. Already only a few degrees above freezing and it's only 7pm."
20-02-2019T21:21:11,Ordithus,Ice is something that does not exist there.
20-02-2019T21:22:19,Dadrobit,GG traffic tomorrow morning.
20-02-2019T21:23:02,Ordithus,Maaaybe just wait for it all to melt.

20-02-2019T21:23:39,Ordithus,Forecast to have the snowiest February on record... tomorrow.
20-02-2019T21:25:57,Dadrobit,"Payson, a town just north of here is set to see 2-3 feet of snow. Traditionally they only get 2-3 inches."
20-02-2019T21:29:37,Ordithus,Payson is at least pretty elevated.
20-02-2019T21:30:07,Dadrobit,Actually I'm considering going hiking tomorrow. Nearby mountains are gonna be totally covered in snow and I haven't done a climb in snowy conditions since I was a teen.
20-02-2019T21:31:03,Ordithus,Do eeeeet!  Just don't die on the way.
20-02-2019T21:31:57,Dadrobit,"Ha, I'll try not to."
20-02-2019T21:33:12,Dadrobit,http://i.imgur.com/vMEJCzB.jpg These guys right here. Superstition Mountains. Very fun climb. Doesn't really have much technical climbing until the end so I can just stop there.
20-02-2019T21:34:26,Ordithus,Awesome!  I wish I had mountains nearby
20-02-2019T21:39:57,Ordithus,That's not to say there's no good hikes around here - there are plenty.  But mountains sure are special
20-02-2019T21:41:31,Dadrobit,"For sure. Out here in Mesa/Apache Junction those mountains are something of an icon. Businesses, schools, streets all around here bear their namesake and/or image."
20-02-2019T21:44:14,Ordithus,Yeah!  Prescott isn't even really close to those mountains and there's a really good meadery named after them
20-02-2019T21:44:27,Ordithus,Paid them a visit a few years back :ctwokinds-daydreamingkat:
20-02-2019T21:51:41,Dadrobit,"Everything's either ""Superstition"" or ""Four Peaks"""
20-02-2019T21:57:31,RimaDraws,hm?
20-02-2019T22:04:46,Dadrobit,The Superstition Mountains and Four Peaks Mountains are nearby mountain ranges that are very iconic to the central AZ area.
20-02-2019T22:05:12,Dadrobit,I was chatting earlier about how everything is covered in snow and I was considering climbing them tomorrow.
