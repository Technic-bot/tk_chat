15-08-2019T01:03:43,Sclimshady,Night Noodle o/
15-08-2019T01:04:50,AspiringNoodle,"Btw, forgot to check the schedule to make sure that my shifts are still the same as they were a few days ago"
15-08-2019T01:05:02,AspiringNoodle,Guess worst case is I come in a few hours early and have to leave right away
15-08-2019T01:05:14,AspiringNoodle,"Okay, bye now.  Sleeeeeeeeep! :ptv-sleepy:"
15-08-2019T04:51:50,SpazztasticKiwi,anyone want to tell why picarto is more broken than the us education system
15-08-2019T05:29:54,FreedomCrusader,"No, that's a secret"

15-08-2019T11:09:15,AspiringNoodle,I swear one of these day's I WON'T sleep until near noon :ptv-unimpressed:
15-08-2019T11:11:11,FreedomCrusader,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
15-08-2019T11:11:27,FreedomCrusader,gl with that
15-08-2019T11:12:05,AspiringNoodle,I'm a classic victim of the snooze button
15-08-2019T11:12:13,AspiringNoodle,"""Just 5 more minutes..."""
15-08-2019T11:12:17,AspiringNoodle,*3 hours later*
15-08-2019T11:12:26,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-unimpressed:
15-08-2019T11:12:44,FreedomCrusader,it's like day 1 of anytime I have vacation or a day off I immediately sleep to noon and then I can't sleep again until 3 am so I wake up at noon
15-08-2019T11:13:16,AspiringNoodle,I want as much free time as possible :ptv-pouty:
15-08-2019T11:13:34,FreedomCrusader,eventually I ahve to go back to work at which point I have a day of 2-3 hours sleep as it's impossible to fall asleep before 3 am earliest
15-08-2019T11:17:04,AspiringNoodle,At this point I just have a bad habit I need to break
15-08-2019T11:17:16,AspiringNoodle,I consistently go to bed and wake up at the times I want
15-08-2019T11:17:27,AspiringNoodle,But I ALWAYS abuse the alarms in my phone
15-08-2019T11:17:33,FreedomCrusader,"that's not a bad habbit, that's sucess in life"
15-08-2019T11:18:03,AspiringNoodle,"Right now, I have 7 alarms :D"
15-08-2019T11:18:13,FreedomCrusader,Also doesn't that kinda fit your work schedule anyway?
15-08-2019T11:18:26,AspiringNoodle,"6 for waking up in the morning, because I haven't settled on that time yet. And 1 for naps"
15-08-2019T11:18:56,AspiringNoodle,"And for morning alarms, I have 2 up, each 30 minutes apart, just in case I sleep through the first one"
15-08-2019T11:19:21,AspiringNoodle,"It may fit my schedule, but it doesn't mean I approve sleeping through half of my free time :ptv-pouty:"
15-08-2019T11:19:56,FreedomCrusader,I think multiple alarms just makes it way easier to chose snooze
15-08-2019T11:20:34,FreedomCrusader,You could also try to setup an alarm with only vibration 5min before your main alarm
15-08-2019T11:21:00,FreedomCrusader,I do sleep very light but I have found that the vibration one jsut makes it much more comfortable to wake up
15-08-2019T11:21:18,FreedomCrusader,as comfortable as being woken up from sleep can be...
15-08-2019T11:26:08,AspiringNoodle,I love how society has gotten more complex / time consuming with more than ever to do
15-08-2019T11:26:21,AspiringNoodle,And somehow work is beginning to regress
15-08-2019T12:52:40,AspiringNoodle,can't wait for the strem tonight
15-08-2019T12:55:41,FreedomCrusader,can't wait to propably be asleep at the time

15-08-2019T14:36:05,AspiringNoodle,Don't have to worry about making arrangements for time off for appointments / interviews
15-08-2019T14:36:19,AspiringNoodle,"Cons: Everything else, lol"
15-08-2019T14:36:38,SomeNiceUser,That’s true.
15-08-2019T14:36:52,AspiringNoodle,"For example, haircut tomorrow"
15-08-2019T14:37:06,AspiringNoodle,"And I typically do those in the morning, so I didn't have to make any calls :D"
15-08-2019T14:38:19,AspiringNoodle,"That said, it's 5 - 9 hours a day of standing up constantly, manic fast-paced environment, potential to accidentally sell tobacco/alcohol to under-aged persons"
15-08-2019T14:38:36,AspiringNoodle,No wonder turnover is so high ;_;
15-08-2019T14:40:04,SomeNiceUser,It’s understandable.
15-08-2019T14:41:14,AspiringNoodle,"SNU-SNU, I believe retail is one of those industries that would be fundamentally different if it didn't have a steady workforce of high turn-over temps"
15-08-2019T14:41:51,AspiringNoodle,"It's not exactly skilled labor, but it is definitely do all the things and multi-task while prioritizing customers"
15-08-2019T14:43:45,AspiringNoodle,"Politics and economics aside, I'm so pumped for strem >:3"
15-08-2019T14:44:00,SomeNiceUser,Same here Noodle.

15-08-2019T14:45:20,AspiringNoodle,I wonder if I'm going to try and throw together my computer before teh stream (if I have a few hours)
15-08-2019T14:46:13,SomeNiceUser,"Well, I guess there will be at least a good 3-4 hours till the stream begins."

15-08-2019T16:01:25,TerraTheWizard,it even says that on the banner
15-08-2019T16:35:00,SpazztasticKiwi,this man at McDonald’s asked me if I knew the manager- where was the manager - then he asks if I know the owner and then he asks if I’m the manager
15-08-2019T16:35:23,SpazztasticKiwi,I am in a tank top and track shorts trying to work on my laptop
15-08-2019T16:35:52,SpazztasticKiwi,“do you work here?” he finally asks

15-08-2019T18:59:56,IronHorseComics,ah
15-08-2019T19:00:14,AspiringNoodle,Naive me thinking that $5 a day for a meal from / at work might be too much
15-08-2019T19:00:54,AspiringNoodle,"But that's actually not a lot, is it?"
15-08-2019T19:06:45,AspiringNoodle,Almost time for strem :ptv-excited:

15-08-2019T19:52:33,Taremong,"But the noodles ought to be cooked, right?"
15-08-2019T19:53:04,Taremong,An iron pipe does not a stent make.

15-08-2019T19:53:25,Taremong,"No, we must save Noodle."
15-08-2019T19:54:26,IronHorseComics,I think they want to boil more spaghetti noodles and put them on Noodle

15-08-2019T19:56:03,IronHorseComics,I thought outer space was the final frontier? Are you telling me that Star Trek lies to us?
15-08-2019T19:56:09,Taremong,But Noodle is not dead yet!
15-08-2019T19:56:11,Sclimshady,Yes
15-08-2019T19:56:23,Taremong,Their noodles still pump noodle through their noodle!
15-08-2019T19:56:31,IronHorseComics,*GASP* heresy!
15-08-2019T19:56:38,BadFoMo,They're getting better.
15-08-2019T19:56:57,Sclimshady,They're only mostly dead
15-08-2019T19:57:04,Taremong,That means partially alive.
15-08-2019T19:57:23,Taremong,*slightly alive
15-08-2019T19:57:23,InTheLionsDen,It would take a miracle.

15-08-2019T20:43:43,LannAF,"I'd probably want to do 7k instead, though."
15-08-2019T20:43:55,LannAF,Just to be safe.
15-08-2019T20:44:18,LannAF,"So if I had to take a guess, probably in 2 years."

15-08-2019T20:44:23,LannAF,or a year and a half.

15-08-2019T21:02:52,Nekonny,"ah, they are quite spacious sage"
15-08-2019T21:03:02,LannAF,"nah I found a GREAT airbnb that fits all of us for cheap, so I could probably find another"
15-08-2019T21:03:02,SpazztasticKiwi,mousy is already dead
15-08-2019T21:03:05,IronHorseComics,they're just tardis
15-08-2019T21:03:10,SpazztasticKiwi,I buy flash frozen
15-08-2019T21:03:12,HoverdudeXL,Lol
15-08-2019T21:03:12,IronHorseComics,bigger on the inside
15-08-2019T21:03:14,LannAF,I just calculate theoreticals.
15-08-2019T21:03:22,LannAF,if I plan in concrete it never works
15-08-2019T21:03:23,Nekonny,most of the hotel rooms are tiny anyway
15-08-2019T21:03:23,SageSaga,i have trouble being on an airplane- much less a capsule
15-08-2019T21:03:30,SpazztasticKiwi,they sell in bigger bulk shipments and cost less to keep
15-08-2019T21:03:41,Sclimshady,But concrete won't fall apart
15-08-2019T21:03:48,CrRAR,yesyes
15-08-2019T21:03:49,SpazztasticKiwi,and pac man frogs do better with food that can’t bite back and cause infection
15-08-2019T21:03:58,CrRAR,true
15-08-2019T21:03:59,Nekonny,if you can survive economy for 16 hours you can survive a hotel room for 8
15-08-2019T21:04:02,LannAF,"Sage if I can keep up my job and also do twitch streaming even -slightly- well, I could arrange stuff in the future."
15-08-2019T21:04:08,SageSaga,if that's the case i guess i should just stay home
15-08-2019T21:04:19,LannAF,idk about 25k
15-08-2019T21:04:22,Nekonny,the airbnb is a good solution tho
15-08-2019T21:04:25,Mippy,No place like home
15-08-2019T21:04:40,LannAF,airbnb is stupid cheap depending if you plan right and take precautions
15-08-2019T21:04:43,Nekonny,I heard you get lay down in buisness too
15-08-2019T21:04:49,LannAF,I saved Ash about..500 dollars
15-08-2019T21:04:51,Nekonny,and its a bargin; at only 8k
15-08-2019T21:04:52,LannAF,"Yes, they do"
15-08-2019T21:04:57,LannAF,That's what Tom used
15-08-2019T21:04:58,CrRAR,lol
15-08-2019T21:05:04,LannAF,That's actually feasible
15-08-2019T21:05:11,Nekonny,I'll have to get some pointers on airbnb with you lann
15-08-2019T21:05:15,LannAF,"I'd want Sticky and Sage to have it, I could go with crap"
15-08-2019T21:05:17,ZahnHolley,Hello y’all! Your friendly neighbor hood Holley is here :D
15-08-2019T21:05:19,SpazztasticKiwi,well there we go she’s eating it
15-08-2019T21:05:22,CrRAR,yo zahn
15-08-2019T21:05:25,Nekonny,because right now our hotel costs are way too high

15-08-2019T21:05:46,LannAF,"At AC, ash was gonna pay 800 fricking dollars"

15-08-2019T21:06:00,MoonDance,Buisness sleep
15-08-2019T21:06:01,Nekonny,800 a nigtht?
15-08-2019T21:06:07,LannAF,Do you need pointers on airbnb or do you have some to give
15-08-2019T21:06:12,LannAF,"no, 800 total"
15-08-2019T21:06:15,Nekonny,I need XD
15-08-2019T21:06:21,Nekonny,for how long?
15-08-2019T21:06:22,LannAF,"oh, sure thing, just discord me whenever"
15-08-2019T21:06:25,somewolfgirl,i pay nothing to visit anthro con...i live like 15 mintutes away >.>
15-08-2019T21:06:39,LannAF,um. the 3rd to the 7th I believe Ron
15-08-2019T21:06:45,LannAF,so 4 days
15-08-2019T21:06:52,LannAF,Instead it was 500$ which our groups split in half.
15-08-2019T21:06:55,LannAF,for the airbnb
15-08-2019T21:07:06,LannAF,so he only paid 250 for him and his wife instead of 800 total for the trip.
15-08-2019T21:07:16,BadFoMo,"Inb4 Pilot: This is your capton speaking; it looks like we're about to hit a little turbulence, everythings fine, just buckle up. (Hangs up intercom) Pilot: Ready?! Co-Pilot: Ready! (Pilot and Co-Pilot do stunt moves.)"

15-08-2019T21:07:29,Nekonny,ahthis was the hotel I stayed in last time

15-08-2019T21:09:33,MoonDance,and that's why they're so much less commercial flights in the air at once
15-08-2019T21:09:42,CrimsonHelsing,"Sorry Karen, Reni said no thanks. And that no thanks is final. ;P"
15-08-2019T21:09:42,LannAF,"Hanging out with, meeting, and spending time with everybody was incredible"

15-08-2019T21:10:33,LannAF,Nothing like sharing those experiences and burning the memories into your mind

15-08-2019T21:23:07,LannAF,"Getting to the airport, the excitement building up, boarding and seeing cities and miles fly by"
15-08-2019T21:23:14,Sclimshady,I have some pretty sweet low flying manouvers by a helicopter I videotaped on my phone
15-08-2019T21:23:14,Nekonny,Isn't teleportation a suicide box of sorts?
15-08-2019T21:23:15,MatyMaty,that Teleportation cabins were just suicide/cloning devices?
15-08-2019T21:23:15,LannAF,"Landing, planning out where to go"
15-08-2019T21:23:15,SageSaga,probably- im a nerd and Folding space is way safer than teleportation
15-08-2019T21:23:16,LannAF,umf
15-08-2019T21:23:26,SageSaga,pretty much
15-08-2019T21:23:33,NezumiYuki,But Sage!
15-08-2019T21:23:35,SpazztasticKiwi,the screaming kids and people who go .2 miles an hour boarding the plane....
15-08-2019T21:23:35,SageSaga,no way to tell if the you that comes out the other side is really you
15-08-2019T21:23:42,ZRO4825,"On the one hand, you'll have much faster ways to get around, and it'll reduce congestion on roads. On the other hand, people will start *expecting* you to teleport frickin everywhere and if you deign to drive you're gonna be ""that weird guy"""
15-08-2019T21:23:45,BadFoMo,Fold Space? Like the Apture Sicentce Hand Held Portal Device?
15-08-2019T21:23:56,LannAF,screw driving
15-08-2019T21:23:56,NezumiYuki,Doctor Wier tried to fold space with the Event Horizon... Look at what happened!
15-08-2019T21:24:03,LannAF,I've gotten over my fear of it
15-08-2019T21:24:09,SageSaga,yeah Portals are a form of folding space
15-08-2019T21:24:11,LannAF,but still ugh
15-08-2019T21:24:20,MatyMaty,One mistake
15-08-2019T21:24:21,ZRO4825,"I'm the other way around, Lann. I love to drive. I just want all the other people who can't drive worth a crap out of my way. :joy:"
15-08-2019T21:24:31,MatyMaty,and you end up like Mitty from Made in Abyss
15-08-2019T21:24:44,CrRAR,oh noooo
15-08-2019T21:24:46,SpazztasticKiwi,my flight back from Boston we were on the same flight with a teen girls cheer squad
15-08-2019T21:24:47,SageSaga,also - if you fold space you can see where you are going
15-08-2019T21:24:47,BadFoMo,"Yeah, I think I could go with portals."
15-08-2019T21:24:49,Sclimshady,I sometimes drive for fun
15-08-2019T21:24:56,SpazztasticKiwi,they all sat behind us
15-08-2019T21:25:01,FoxXcalibur,"Wormhole travel, like in Interstellar."

15-08-2019T21:25:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ll just say thank the Lord for headphones

15-08-2019T21:25:37,ZRO4825,Heyyo Rima~
15-08-2019T21:25:37,Mippy,Hello Rima
15-08-2019T21:25:38,ZahnHolley,I wanna travel back in time. And Find out what the 80s is like?
15-08-2019T21:25:39,RimaDraws,hiii
15-08-2019T21:25:40,SageSaga,yo Rima
15-08-2019T21:25:45,RimaDraws,hi sage
15-08-2019T21:25:47,LannAF,I want to be able to stop time
15-08-2019T21:25:54,SpazztasticKiwi,WAZZAAAP
15-08-2019T21:25:56,LannAF,I just...I just need more time.
15-08-2019T21:25:56,w0lfmare,"""I'll just send in my clone"""
15-08-2019T21:25:58,NezumiYuki,"I don't know about Chel and the Portal games but, any time anyone mentions ""Portals"" I automatically think of Diablo and those glorious Blue Town Portals!"
15-08-2019T21:26:06,SageSaga,stopping time is dangerous
15-08-2019T21:26:07,SpazztasticKiwi,I want to be able to eat without getting fat
15-08-2019T21:26:16,BadFoMo,Wait! Can I have Fold Space Portals in my house AND my car?
15-08-2019T21:26:17,LannAF,"well, earth keeps moving sage"
15-08-2019T21:26:22,LannAF,localized timestop
15-08-2019T21:26:27,MatyMaty,"you don't need to stop time, Sage"
15-08-2019T21:26:30,LannAF,that keeps large objects in motion so shit doesn't go whack
15-08-2019T21:26:32,SageSaga,everyone would die Lann
15-08-2019T21:26:34,Mippy,What Kiwi said....except replace fat with fatter
15-08-2019T21:26:39,MatyMaty,just move so fast everything seems to have stopped
15-08-2019T21:26:39,Nekonny,Flight or invisibility?
15-08-2019T21:26:41,SpazztasticKiwi,about how much is anthrocon
15-08-2019T21:26:44,LannAF,sage timestops then xD
15-08-2019T21:26:50,MatyMaty,although I guess that would also make you age much faster?
15-08-2019T21:26:55,SageSaga,yep
15-08-2019T21:27:07,LannAF,safe timestops
15-08-2019T21:27:09,LannAF,not sage timestops.
15-08-2019T21:27:21,Nekonny,XD
15-08-2019T21:27:23,SageSaga,the best way around it is Displacement from Time and the ability to freely move through space
15-08-2019T21:27:27,RimaDraws,how is all tonight
15-08-2019T21:27:31,LannAF,TERRIBLE RIMA
15-08-2019T21:27:34,LannAF,I'm procrastinating.
15-08-2019T21:27:36,Justanotheruser7118,so uhh
15-08-2019T21:27:37,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"P good, u?"
15-08-2019T21:27:42,RimaDraws,so am i but i am good
15-08-2019T21:27:46,SageSaga,this way you could remove yourself from time - and could replace yourself in it at the right place
15-08-2019T21:28:01,Mippy,Ok...I really should be doodling to get back in the flow for school though
15-08-2019T21:28:06,NezumiYuki,"Pretty good and chill here, how about yourself, Rima?"
15-08-2019T21:28:10,LannAF,I want timestop with a really satisfying distortion noise anytime I used it
15-08-2019T21:28:11,IronHorseComics,trying to write Fluffy 500 Ch7
15-08-2019T21:28:13,NezumiYuki,Ah cook
15-08-2019T21:28:16,LannAF,Anything less would be...disappointing
15-08-2019T21:28:19,NezumiYuki,cool*
15-08-2019T21:28:20,SageSaga,if you went back in time 6 months - where would you be? The answer is far away from earth...
15-08-2019T21:28:24,RimaDraws,i got to try our new whiskey today at work
15-08-2019T21:28:44,LannAF,what about pop:sands of time time reversal?
15-08-2019T21:28:50,Sclimshady,"Oooo, I like me some Whiskey"
15-08-2019T21:28:56,Nekonny,wants to state his theory about time travel...
15-08-2019T21:28:58,LannAF,you'd have to experience the horrific pain if you got into an accident
15-08-2019T21:29:00,Mippy,Anything to write home about? Rima
15-08-2019T21:29:01,RimaDraws,it is our new tennessee whiskey tennessee apple
15-08-2019T21:29:11,LannAF,but it'd be..Safeish?
15-08-2019T21:29:13,RimaDraws,we all got to try before we send it out
15-08-2019T21:29:15,NezumiYuki,Mmmm apples
15-08-2019T21:29:43,NezumiYuki,would it be terribly dangerous to give a barrel of Jimmy or Jack to Lady Nora?
15-08-2019T21:29:52,Mippy,I like apples.
15-08-2019T21:29:56,ZahnHolley,They should invent the time machine. That would have been so unique :3
15-08-2019T21:29:56,BadFoMo,@Twokinds Transformation Sequence?
15-08-2019T21:30:00,IronHorseComics,she can take it

15-08-2019T21:32:41,ZahnHolley,chugging on whiskey
15-08-2019T21:32:44,RimaDraws,it was stout and sour. but its supposed to be. if you sip it slowly you can taste the apple in it
15-08-2019T21:32:49,Nekonny,ah
15-08-2019T21:32:51,RimaDraws,but overall good

15-08-2019T23:28:33,Mippy,One thing about going to school for art is that your instructors also give you buisness advise
15-08-2019T23:30:17,AspiringNoodle,Hopefully in the future people will realize that artists are worth so much more
15-08-2019T23:30:32,SomeNiceUser,"I didn’t really get any advice from my school’s art teacher, except actual tip on drawing."
15-08-2019T23:31:06,AspiringNoodle,"I only got a minor in art, and while I seemed to struggle a smidge with 2d, 3d came relatively easy xD"
15-08-2019T23:31:14,AspiringNoodle,Maybe that's why I'm obsessed with drawing?
15-08-2019T23:31:18,Mippy,Are you majoring in art? Or are you talking in highschool?
15-08-2019T23:32:37,SomeNiceUser,Highschool.
15-08-2019T23:33:02,Mippy,That's why. I'm talking post secondary.
15-08-2019T23:33:09,AspiringNoodle,Best advice I can give
15-08-2019T23:33:26,AspiringNoodle,"If you get commissioned, estimate how many hours you'll spend on the piece"
15-08-2019T23:33:32,AspiringNoodle,"Then decide, how many $ an hour are you worth? :P"
15-08-2019T23:34:14,SageSaga,and then throw all that out because estimating some art is darn near impossible
15-08-2019T23:34:21,Sclimshady,Lol
15-08-2019T23:34:27,Mippy,lol
15-08-2019T23:34:40,Mippy,True that
15-08-2019T23:34:42,SomeNiceUser,lol
15-08-2019T23:34:56,InTheLionsDen,And then they change what they are asking for.

15-08-2019T23:40:37,AspiringNoodle,"Any of you ever listen to music, read a comic, play a video game, etc.  And then want to try your hand at it?"
15-08-2019T23:40:49,MuonNeutrino,i forget what strip/artpiece that smiling raine comes from....
15-08-2019T23:40:58,MuonNeutrino,i know i recognize it but can't remember exactly where
15-08-2019T23:41:00,FenceEqualizer,All the time.
15-08-2019T23:41:18,Sclimshady,I got into anthro art because of this community
15-08-2019T23:41:33,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I'm sorry Shady
15-08-2019T23:41:37,AspiringNoodle,"For me, I don't really care for most pop music.  I love listening to / singing it.  But it's the video game music I love :P"
15-08-2019T23:41:43,SomeNiceUser,Looking into it muon
15-08-2019T23:41:51,AspiringNoodle,"...I want to replay Star Fox Assault now for the music, lol"

15-08-2019T23:42:11,NezumiYuki,same here Shady.  In fact my hobby skills have grown to the point where I might consider taking up anthro commissions.  xD
15-08-2019T23:42:37,MuonNeutrino,"what do you mean by 'try your hand at it', @AspiringNoodle ? as in try *making* one of those things?"
15-08-2019T23:42:38,CrimsonHelsing,"heart of the swarm, immediate music (or something like that) that music always got my heart pumping"
15-08-2019T23:42:39,TheOtherEric,"Now, is coloring all on one layer here? Or clipping mask?"
15-08-2019T23:42:50,AspiringNoodle,Yesh :D
15-08-2019T23:42:53,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah same

15-08-2019T23:43:19,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"I do believe clipping mask, Eric"
15-08-2019T23:43:24,Sclimshady,Drop your soundcloud Teddy
15-08-2019T23:43:35,MarvTheHugPharaoh,slap down a base color and clip mask over that
15-08-2019T23:43:41,NezumiYuki,@theothereric  clipping or at the very least color on a separate layer.
15-08-2019T23:43:48,AspiringNoodle,"In particular, I love game music that uses classical instruments in very aggressive and modern styles"
15-08-2019T23:44:08,Mippy,Naw....I’ve been into anthro art since I was a wee little Redwall fan drawing characters and recolour “OCs”
15-08-2019T23:44:19,AspiringNoodle,"Oh yeah... did you guys know that ""The World Revolving"" sounds AMAZING when played solely on an accordian?"
15-08-2019T23:44:26,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Dude, redwell was hype"

15-08-2019T23:44:50,NezumiYuki,@marv   whataya mean was?   To loyal fans it STILL IS
15-08-2019T23:44:51,MuonNeutrino,"in hindsight, the redwall books got *extremely* formulaic after a while, but they were still some good stuff"
15-08-2019T23:45:44,Mippy,XD I still have all the books packed up somewhere. The later ones weren’t as good but I still read them religiously
15-08-2019T23:46:27,Sclimshady,"Warriors, anyone read those?"
