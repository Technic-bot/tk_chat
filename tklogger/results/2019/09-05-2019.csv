09-05-2019T00:09:00,Bgrmystr2,"don't put it back, let a medical professional do it, cuz they'll be able to know if it's going to do more harm than good"
09-05-2019T00:09:12,Bgrmystr2,and whether you need to put it in a cast or somesuch immediately afterwards.
09-05-2019T00:09:25,Bgrmystr2,something most ordinary people simply do not have.
09-05-2019T00:20:01,SpazztasticKiwi,You wanna know the bad part?
09-05-2019T00:20:27,SpazztasticKiwi,He pushes it back. The NOISE
09-05-2019T00:23:10,SpazztasticKiwi,I remember Mark apparently did the same when he broke his arm. At least he admits it was ridiculously stupid
09-05-2019T02:03:48,SpazztasticKiwi,I üõå now

09-05-2019T11:48:38,CrimsonQuill,One should not set broken bones by oneself.
09-05-2019T11:48:45,CrimsonQuill,It usually leads to disaster.
09-05-2019T11:49:11,CrimsonQuill,"In fact, unless one knows what one is doing, one should just see a medical professional."
09-05-2019T11:49:18,CrimsonQuill,A doctor or a GP or a nurse.
09-05-2019T11:49:25,CrimsonQuill,Or someone who knows first aid at lease.
09-05-2019T11:49:27,CrimsonQuill,Also hell
09-05-2019T11:49:30,CrimsonQuill,Hello
09-05-2019T11:49:39,CrimsonQuill,"I was rude, didn't say hello"

09-05-2019T16:10:18,CrimsonQuill,hullo there
09-05-2019T16:11:11,IronHorseComics,even'n
09-05-2019T16:17:09,Sclimshady,That was a very dramatic entrance to an online chat
09-05-2019T16:17:27,CrimsonQuill,Hullo Sclim
09-05-2019T16:17:41,IronHorseComics,"well it IS in the name, Iron Horse refers to locomotives"
09-05-2019T16:20:40,CrimsonQuill,"Iron Horses are those American steam locomotives with the giant funnels and lamps, aren't they?"
09-05-2019T16:21:02,IronHorseComics,it's more steam locomotives in general
09-05-2019T16:21:21,CrimsonQuill,I'd like to see the City of Truro and the Flying Scotsman.
09-05-2019T16:21:32,CrimsonQuill,Or be the train driver for the Tornado.
09-05-2019T16:21:55,IronHorseComics,"eh, I'd rather go see Big Boy"
09-05-2019T16:22:22,CrimsonQuill,Just seen a picture. Lives up to the name.
09-05-2019T16:23:51,IronHorseComics,"you're only now learning about the big boys? well you're in luck. To celebrate the 150th anniversary of the completion of the transcontinental railroad, UP 4014 has been brought back to steam for the first time since the late 50's"
09-05-2019T16:24:10,CrimsonQuill,I know more about UK Steam locomotives than US ones...
09-05-2019T16:24:25,CrimsonQuill,Although I have forgotten about many of them. :(
09-05-2019T16:24:40,IronHorseComics,"that's a shame, the latter point at least"
09-05-2019T16:25:52,IronHorseComics,"actually what I really can't wait for is the completion of the restoration of Nashville, Chattanooga, & St. Louis 576, the last of her entire railroad steam fleet. It's very, very local for me"
09-05-2019T16:26:36,CrimsonQuill,I don't think I've actually been on a steam train yet..soon .
09-05-2019T16:26:57,IronHorseComics,it's worth it
09-05-2019T16:29:45,IronHorseComics,"not gonna ask Tom to draw a locomotive because most artists don't have a clue how they work and how their motions are set up. 90% of the time they leave the tender, it's like they're leaving behind a gas tank"
09-05-2019T16:30:28,CrimsonQuill,I read the James May How to fly an Airbus book...it has a chapter devoted to how to drive a Tornado Steam Locomotive.
09-05-2019T16:30:30,Sclimshady,"Theres a really cool shop in bennett, Co that casts all the parts for locomotive restorations in house and makes functioning scale models"
09-05-2019T16:32:18,IronHorseComics,the UK loco controls are set up differently from the US ones. But if any average joe could be trusted with something like that it's James May
09-05-2019T16:34:15,CrimsonQuill,"Heh, he described a good fireman as an artist-it apparently takes a lot more than just flinging the coal in to keep the fire running efficiently."
09-05-2019T16:34:43,CrimsonQuill,"And of course, one has to keep an eye on the water in the boiler, the pressure, the distance...all sorts of things."
09-05-2019T16:34:48,CrimsonQuill,I want to give it a go!
09-05-2019T16:36:38,IronHorseComics,"and here's the trick, you can't put too much coal in, you won't be efficient that way"
09-05-2019T16:37:44,CrimsonQuill,"No, it'll run rich"
09-05-2019T16:37:48,CrimsonQuill,Oily black smoke
09-05-2019T16:37:53,CrimsonQuill,Wastes valuable energy
09-05-2019T16:37:59,CrimsonQuill,One needs to spread it out
09-05-2019T16:38:07,CrimsonQuill,So one gets nice wispy smoke.
09-05-2019T16:38:14,IronHorseComics,"heh, piss off the bozos in greenpeace, I like your style"
09-05-2019T16:38:55,CrimsonQuill,"Well, our problem isn't just using the wrong types of energy...we're not using what we have efficiently either."
09-05-2019T16:39:03,CrimsonQuill,But Steam trains are alright to me.
09-05-2019T16:39:07,CrimsonQuill,I love them so much...
09-05-2019T16:39:16,IronHorseComics,"yeah, most their exhaust is just steam anyway"
09-05-2019T16:39:45,CrimsonQuill,I'm listening to the Doctor's anti-war speech from Doctor Who series 9 at the moment...
09-05-2019T16:40:05,CrimsonQuill,Dear God. Peter Capaldi really does BECOME the Doctor.
09-05-2019T16:40:15,CrimsonQuill,I think he likes trains.
09-05-2019T16:41:04,IronHorseComics,it's pretty hard to not like trains
09-05-2019T16:42:12,CrimsonQuill,"""I like Trains"". SPLATCH!#"
09-05-2019T16:42:14,CrimsonQuill,xd
09-05-2019T16:42:18,CrimsonQuill,XD
09-05-2019T16:42:55,IronHorseComics,"you gotta be 1: tree hugger 2: Dr. Beeching or 3: the US government in the 50's, they were bending over backwards to support roads and airliners at the railroads expense"
09-05-2019T16:43:10,IronHorseComics,you gotta be one of those to dislike trains
09-05-2019T16:44:32,CrimsonQuill,I love trees.
09-05-2019T16:44:36,CrimsonQuill,But I love Trains.
09-05-2019T16:44:43,CrimsonQuill,They can exist together.
09-05-2019T16:44:50,CrimsonQuill,Plant more trees...and run more trains.
09-05-2019T16:44:54,CrimsonQuill,Win-Win!
09-05-2019T16:45:41,IronHorseComics,"when I say tree huggers, I mean the ones that worship Captain Planet as a god"
09-05-2019T16:48:28,IronHorseComics,"anyway, I hope my suggestion gets picked this week, it's the month of May and that means the Indianapolis 500"
09-05-2019T16:48:44,IronHorseComics,"which means this time around, Kat's gonna get the ride of her life"
09-05-2019T16:48:45,CrimsonQuill,What's your suggestion?
09-05-2019T16:48:51,Sclimshady,lol
09-05-2019T16:49:15,IronHorseComics,Kat riding in a dual sea IndyCar at full speed with the leading lady of my comic in the driver's seat
09-05-2019T16:49:29,CrimsonQuill,Ok.
09-05-2019T16:49:37,CrimsonQuill,Cool.

09-05-2019T16:50:52,CrimsonQuill,"Remind me, which was last time/"

09-05-2019T16:51:52,CrimsonQuill,Both in Halfkind forms.
09-05-2019T16:51:56,CrimsonQuill,As usual.
09-05-2019T16:52:04,Sclimshady,I vote for yours every time
09-05-2019T16:52:15,CrimsonQuill,"I'll keep setting it up-it's been right up to 5th and 2nd place, I'll get them there!"
09-05-2019T16:52:19,CrimsonQuill,I promise you that!
09-05-2019T16:52:22,CrimsonQuill,Eventually!
09-05-2019T16:52:31,CrimsonQuill,"Also, you do? Thanks!"
09-05-2019T16:52:55,Sclimshady,"Please do, I want to see it"
09-05-2019T16:53:50,Sclimshady,"Also, I just learned people are boycotting In-n-out. What has the world come to?"
09-05-2019T16:54:04,CrimsonQuill,What's In-n-out?
09-05-2019T16:54:16,IronHorseComics,*there's no In-n-Out where I live so I don't give two craps*
09-05-2019T16:54:34,Sclimshady,The best made to order burger chain in the US
09-05-2019T16:54:48,CrimsonQuill,Oh ok
09-05-2019T16:55:58,Sclimshady,But dont eat there unless your'e in california because the out of state locations aren't great

09-05-2019T16:57:33,Bgrmystr2,and every single food place has a bad location in the same state. It's not possible for them all to be good unless there's only one location in the whole state.
09-05-2019T16:57:40,Bgrmystr2,one is guaranteed to be better than the other.
09-05-2019T16:58:07,Bgrmystr2,Your thoughts are all lies :V

09-05-2019T17:02:50,CrimsonQuill,No.
09-05-2019T17:02:51,IronHorseComics,maybe
09-05-2019T17:02:54,CrimsonQuill,I'm going to bed.

09-05-2019T17:05:07,IronHorseComics,I'll draw Natani riding in a stock car with Dale Earfluff (geddit?) driving
09-05-2019T17:05:42,IronHorseComics,"the Coca-Cola 600 is also this month, as is the Monaco Grand Prix if I'm not mistaken"
09-05-2019T17:06:01,Sclimshady,"Im gonna be honest, I wouldnt get into a car anywhere near the intimidator"
09-05-2019T17:06:32,IronHorseComics,"my dale is much yonger than his human counterpart, college aged"
09-05-2019T17:07:04,IronHorseComics,"but yeah, I wouldn't want to be anywhere near him on the racetrack either"
09-05-2019T17:12:40,IronHorseComics,"oh a side note, I learned something interesting last week...I need to relearn HTML 5 and CSS"
09-05-2019T17:13:42,Sclimshady,I honestly don't even know what those do so you have me beat.
09-05-2019T17:14:09,IronHorseComics,"HTML 5 is the current backbone of web sites today, CSS is web styling"
09-05-2019T17:14:16,IronHorseComics,all of it coding
09-05-2019T17:15:14,Sclimshady,"Ok,  I may have seen some of it then. im trying to figure out how to set up a business website and those were probably mentioned"
09-05-2019T17:16:40,IronHorseComics,"first rule, styling done on an HTML file will override any coding on a CSS file"
09-05-2019T17:18:38,Sclimshady,Noted.  I've still got awhile until I need it so my learning has been slow
09-05-2019T17:19:05,IronHorseComics,it'll take a while to learn it
09-05-2019T17:19:38,Sclimshady,Well I don't feel so bad now
09-05-2019T17:19:53,IronHorseComics,I do advise taking a class on it
09-05-2019T17:20:55,Sclimshady,Probably a good call. I only have one more semester of school and like 3 years of scholarship so I'll probably use that
09-05-2019T17:22:11,IronHorseComics,I advise you learn everything you can
09-05-2019T17:23:02,IronHorseComics,and learn to code it manually instead of using Adobe dreamweaver
09-05-2019T17:25:21,Sclimshady,"I don't think I need to go that far, I'm just trying to make a website for the fabrication company i'm planning on opening."
09-05-2019T17:26:51,IronHorseComics,what are you fabricating?
09-05-2019T17:27:59,Sclimshady,Trucks and hot rods mainly
09-05-2019T17:28:09,IronHorseComics,ah
09-05-2019T17:28:12,IronHorseComics,nice
09-05-2019T17:30:15,Sclimshady,"Yeah, I found a master who's willing to take an apprentice so that was pretty lucky."
09-05-2019T17:32:40,IronHorseComics,that's great
09-05-2019T19:15:18,IronHorseComics,so is anyone here besides me?
09-05-2019T19:15:40,InTheLionsDen,Just you.
09-05-2019T19:15:55,Bgrmystr2,not even you are here. It's just an illusion.

09-05-2019T21:56:14,Sclimshady,I have no idea what that is

09-05-2019T21:58:27,Sclimshady,Nothing?
09-05-2019T21:58:29,MarvTheHugPharaoh,leopards have a larger fan base
09-05-2019T21:58:45,Nekonny,thats one pissed off cat

09-05-2019T21:59:42,Sclimshady,I would gladly give my face to pet the kitty
09-05-2019T21:59:47,Mihari,Not likely... cheetah claws are very blunt more for traction in running than doing damage

09-05-2019T22:00:03,Sclimshady,:ctwokinds-nibsdance:
09-05-2019T22:00:03,Tharkis,"there's only one leopard native to the americas, what is it? =)"
09-05-2019T22:00:05,steelabjur,I live not too far from a cheetah refuge in Oregon.
09-05-2019T22:00:06,SageSaga,they are mostly for gripping not killing
09-05-2019T22:00:29,Ordithus,Don't they mostly choke their prey?
09-05-2019T22:00:42,Sclimshady,"Still stronger than me, im not gonna fight it"
09-05-2019T22:00:52,Tharkis,ocelots !
09-05-2019T22:00:56,Ordithus,A cheetah would just run away
09-05-2019T22:00:59,SageSaga,most animals go for the throat- cept Giraffes
09-05-2019T22:01:02,Mihari,They actually aren't much stronger than you.
09-05-2019T22:01:10,Mihari,Cheetahs will avoid fights at all costs.
09-05-2019T22:01:19,Sclimshady,Thats what you think
09-05-2019T22:01:25,AspiringNoodle,They spec'd too many points into agility
09-05-2019T22:01:26,Ordithus,"If they could be chill enough, and it wasn't for dietary restrictions..."
09-05-2019T22:01:28,Aimbotexe,"Giraffes do go for the throat, they just use their throats as clubs"
09-05-2019T22:01:28,Mihari,It's not what I think it's a proven fact.
09-05-2019T22:01:29,AspiringNoodle,"Not enough in strength, haha"
09-05-2019T22:01:34,BadFoMo,"Rose: Hmm. Well that seams to have worked. As for /you/, Mr. Pervert, I know how you can help keep your friend's transformations in check; ...And teach you a lessen about barging in like that."
09-05-2019T22:01:41,Sclimshady,Im joking about being weak
09-05-2019T22:01:42,Nekonny,that bite can hurt
09-05-2019T22:01:51,SageSaga,no when Giraffes fight they go for body blows or the back of the head
09-05-2019T22:02:14,Aimbotexe,Not in the documentaries I've seen
09-05-2019T22:02:17,Nekonny,"it's not so much about strength, more like who can take the most pain before running off"
09-05-2019T22:02:19,Tharkis,wild cheetahs are curious kitties and like to investigate humans
09-05-2019T22:02:20,Sclimshady,"Im just gonna not fight any animals, how about that"
09-05-2019T22:02:34,Supahbuzzer,"well, TF incomplete. see you in a week, or month, year, whenever full wolf raine returns again....."
09-05-2019T22:02:37,SageSaga,they use their necks - but they dont aim for the neck because thats their weapon
09-05-2019T22:02:47,Tharkis,i adore the photo of that british tourist in the land rover when the cheetah jumped inside to check it out
09-05-2019T22:02:55,Ordithus,haha I love that one
09-05-2019T22:03:09,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-keithdotdotdot:*[Hi kitty]
09-05-2019T22:03:11,AspiringNoodle,Nature is scary.  Giraffes evolved to use their neck and head like a weapon. There spine is craaaazy
09-05-2019T22:03:12,Mihari,They are the biggest small cats.
09-05-2019T22:03:17,AspiringNoodle,Their*
09-05-2019T22:03:21,Aimbotexe,They might not aim for the neck but they still hit it the majority of the time (at least thats what I've seen)
09-05-2019T22:03:28,Mihari,Very curious and unique cat.
09-05-2019T22:03:29,Sclimshady,"Damn nature, you scary"
09-05-2019T22:03:55,Tharkis,and pretty
09-05-2019T22:03:56,Ordithus,"If they were as suitable for pets as a big doggo, I would.  But they are not."
09-05-2019T22:04:06,Nekonny,"I guess there was a misunderstanding, the raffle is for me to draw, not tom or sage"
09-05-2019T22:04:14,Nekonny,Sorry about that ^^
09-05-2019T22:04:15,Tharkis,"they purr too, loudly"
09-05-2019T22:04:21,Mihari,"Wow, hehe"
09-05-2019T22:04:28,Sclimshady,Its idleing
09-05-2019T22:04:35,SageSaga,giraffe neck is very strong- its not a good place to hit- but the back of the neck and into the head is the main artery- if you block the flow of blood there for a second- they fall unconscious
09-05-2019T22:04:37,Nekonny,"I'll have to roll one more time, not that Ive cleared that up"

09-05-2019T23:24:23,Sclimshady,I've sen a music video used to get a guy for murder before
09-05-2019T23:24:23,Muddy,Tom.. that would be a great TwoKinds gag. I can see it now... something involving Sythe and Nibs.
09-05-2019T23:24:36,LannAF,that sounds like something kameloh would be involved in
09-05-2019T23:24:52,LannAF,many pepe memes
09-05-2019T23:24:59,CrRAR,It's only tie before we get a serial killer movie that leaves emojis at the crime scenes.

09-05-2019T23:34:56,BadFoMo,Yep.
09-05-2019T23:35:00,CrRAR,Indubitably
09-05-2019T23:35:17,Muddy,And Rose is Eukre's cousin.

09-05-2019T23:36:23,CrRAR,lol
09-05-2019T23:36:25,Combak,Their grandparents.... We don't know their name.
09-05-2019T23:37:02,Combak,"Rose's and Euchre's ganrdparents, to be clear. Raine's great-grandparents."
09-05-2019T23:37:09,Combak,*grandparents
09-05-2019T23:37:43,BadFoMo,Grandma Nora?
09-05-2019T23:37:50,Ordithus,Unlikely
09-05-2019T23:37:57,Sclimshady,That would be a twist
09-05-2019T23:38:01,CrRAR,lol
09-05-2019T23:38:17,Ordithus,Or coincidence.  Lady Nora can't be the only Nora in the world
09-05-2019T23:38:38,Sclimshady,There can only be one
09-05-2019T23:39:21,Muddy,"Well it must make for an interesting family tree.. Rose, Raine, Euchre"
09-05-2019T23:39:46,BadFoMo,Mary?
09-05-2019T23:40:13,Muddy,"Makes one wonder if Trace's family tree runs in here someplace, with Rose and Raine?"
09-05-2019T23:40:33,Sclimshady,"Probably not, he was a farm boy"
09-05-2019T23:41:15,Ordithus,Legacy and Silverlock are not related as far as we know

09-05-2019T23:42:06,Muddy,Well considering that Trace will now have a kid with a Forest Tiger line.. .who can tell?
09-05-2019T23:42:31,Ordithus,Something about space-time
09-05-2019T23:42:50,Sclimshady,Wibbly-wobbly and the likes
09-05-2019T23:42:55,MarvTheHugPharaoh,and the fact trace was 6 when Raine was born
09-05-2019T23:43:56,BadFoMo,Should I play that Banjo tune?
09-05-2019T23:43:57,Ordithus,"Sythe is Karen's dad, tho"

09-05-2019T23:44:09,Sclimshady,It is cannon
09-05-2019T23:44:15,MarvTheHugPharaoh,That would make the sythe x maren ship a bit weird tho
09-05-2019T23:44:32,CrRAR,lol
09-05-2019T23:44:45,Sclimshady,Yeah but you ship RainexZen so theres that
09-05-2019T23:44:51,Muddy,Wait.. Sythe?  Naw... I don't think Sythe could even... he's still to much the virgin IMO.
09-05-2019T23:45:22,BadFoMo,"...And know I'm remembering that one ped from GTA3 who would say ""My mother is my sister!"""
09-05-2019T23:45:32,CrRAR,haha
09-05-2019T23:46:10,SamuelLeumas,That's a GTA 3 thing? I would have thought that would be in the redneck region of GTA:SA
09-05-2019T23:46:12,Muddy,You know... even for one day.. I think it would be cool to have the changing powers of Raine. Though I'd then worry about fleas.
09-05-2019T23:46:32,Sclimshady,I dont have fleas!:ctwokinds-RaineEep:

09-05-2019T23:48:16,Muddy,One advantage we Human's have.. no bugs on us.. unless we're truly filthy.
09-05-2019T23:48:37,SamuelLeumas,It's been too long since I played GTA 3
09-05-2019T23:48:45,BadFoMo,Same.
09-05-2019T23:48:59,SamuelLeumas,GTA VC is still my favourite
09-05-2019T23:49:17,Muddy,Tom.. I love your shading method. Great depth to Raine here.
09-05-2019T23:49:27,BadFoMo,I like all of them.
09-05-2019T23:50:07,SamuelLeumas,"So it really is GTA 3, youtube basically gave me the search suggestion"
09-05-2019T23:50:43,BadFoMo,...What?
09-05-2019T23:50:49,Muddy,My 85 year old dad paints.. has for years.  Showed him the Twokinds strip from the first panel. Then the most resent. All he said about Tom's quality was.. WOW!!
09-05-2019T23:51:01,SamuelLeumas,Looked up the quote on youtube
09-05-2019T23:51:02,Combak,Nice.
09-05-2019T23:51:14,Combak,"Muddy, did you tell him the time span?"
09-05-2019T23:51:21,Muddy,Yes.
09-05-2019T23:51:32,SamuelLeumas,"As in I just typed ""gta 3 my"" and the first suggestion was ""my mother is my sister"""
