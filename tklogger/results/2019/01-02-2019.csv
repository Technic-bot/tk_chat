01-02-2019T00:01:43,ZRO4825,"Is that a subtle way of telling me ""Enough Nyna outfits"" Sage? :P"
01-02-2019T00:02:04,Bgrmystr2,I love that the characters know you by name
01-02-2019T00:02:05,MikeHollard,i think estimate time the new page of Twokinds will be around 1 or 2 hour
01-02-2019T00:02:14,SageSaga,"Nope, I like Nyna's outfit- but it doesnt really work on every girl"
01-02-2019T00:02:24,ZRO4825,True! But I have a goal!
01-02-2019T00:02:41,ZRO4825,"But I mean, we already got Toyoko and Michelle, so that's the two bustiest in Yosh out of the way :thinking:"
01-02-2019T00:03:01,SageSaga,wow- you dont know who the bustiest are
01-02-2019T00:03:27,ZRO4825,"It's not Toyoko, Michelle, Blue, Kate, and the Demoness?"
01-02-2019T00:03:31,Garrettb1425,night'o
01-02-2019T00:03:35,SageSaga,not in that order
01-02-2019T00:03:38,Garrettb1425,headin to bed
01-02-2019T00:03:42,Combak,"Mike, you think the page will be done in 2 hours?"
01-02-2019T00:03:49,Combak,Night Garrett!
01-02-2019T00:03:58,Garrettb1425,night
01-02-2019T00:04:06,ZRO4825,"Well, the Demoness is kinda...adjustable, iirc, but her base size I know was up there, though I was thinking she was smaller than Kate"
01-02-2019T00:04:21,SageSaga,"Michelle and Blue are the same size, Toyoko is normally number 1 but yeah Demoness can be bigger- though i dont like drawing that"
01-02-2019T00:04:30,ZRO4825,Right
01-02-2019T00:04:38,Mihari,Technically all the girls should be 3-5 sizes smaller.
01-02-2019T00:04:44,ZRO4825,lol
01-02-2019T00:04:50,Mihari,I'm not joking.
01-02-2019T00:05:34,Mippy,3-5 sizes smaller....I COULD GET BRAS IN NORMAL STORES!
01-02-2019T00:05:50,Mihari,"Kate started out a C maybe D, now she's easily a F or G depending on the comic."
01-02-2019T00:06:19,ZRO4825,CCS strikes again!
01-02-2019T00:06:34,SageSaga,yeah ive over exaggerated breast sizes too much
01-02-2019T00:06:40,Mihari,Only convenient for you ZRO.
01-02-2019T00:06:56,MikeHollard,"question: who do you think is the ""Busties"" in Twokinds?"
01-02-2019T00:07:07,SageSaga,and CCS only really works when its convenient- if its all the time its not CCS
01-02-2019T00:07:09,ZRO4825,"In my defense, I like it that way in art, cuz it's more fun on the eyes. My realistic preferences are far more normal. ^^"
01-02-2019T00:07:53,Combak,"Mike: Nat, maybe Adelaide"
01-02-2019T00:07:59,Mippy,...He's got a cute litte heart nose :ctwokinds-daydreamingkat:
01-02-2019T00:13:37,SageSaga,"Rose - ""Pweh, its ok Trace, I saved them, instead of being killed by a Golem I teleported them safely away"" ""Where to?"" ""The Dungeon of Nightmares... oh no"""
01-02-2019T00:13:50,Twokinds,XD
01-02-2019T00:14:42,Twokinds,"Next stop, the graveyard of death"
01-02-2019T00:14:55,SageSaga,"""Why would you send them there?!"" ""It was the fist option on the teleport menu!"" ""Why do we have a dungeon on nightmares?!"" ""YOU SAID 'Saria! You know what we need?! A DUNGEON OF NIGTMARES!' and she got it for you on your birthday!"""
01-02-2019T00:15:06,MrEase,"so many Keidran died in those dungeons, Maddie, Karen, don't touch ANYTHING"
01-02-2019T00:15:12,InTheLionsDen,The Bog of Stench.
01-02-2019T00:15:33,Twokinds,"Trace ""Isn't 'Graveyard of Death' redundant?"" Rose ""Not in this case"""
01-02-2019T00:16:10,MrEase,"oh wait, the wolf guy is probably there too"
01-02-2019T00:16:18,SageSaga,"""Here lies Death and all of Death's family"""
01-02-2019T00:16:19,unsteddyphoenix,"""Well considering it's next to the graveyard of undeath..."""
01-02-2019T00:16:28,MrEase,I just thought of that
01-02-2019T00:16:42,InTheLionsDen,The Graveyard of Mostly Dead.
01-02-2019T00:16:55,Twokinds,And a chicken for some reason
01-02-2019T00:17:05,InTheLionsDen,Bob
01-02-2019T00:17:19,Mippy,Birb
01-02-2019T00:17:33,unsteddyphoenix,We know why
01-02-2019T00:20:02,MrEase,do not eat bob
01-02-2019T00:21:00,Tharkis,everything sounds cooler when you add 'of death!' to the end of it
01-02-2019T00:21:02,Mippy,I ate bob for supper
01-02-2019T00:21:13,Tharkis,do not eat the bob chicken .... OF DEATH !
01-02-2019T00:21:31,MrEase,"so I got a dumb question about the summoning table, does it summon food from anywhere or just the mansion grounds"
01-02-2019T00:21:51,Mippy,Chicken of Death....It has the bird flu
01-02-2019T00:23:43,SonOfGoku,Or chicken pox
01-02-2019T00:25:21,Twokinds,Just the mansion
01-02-2019T00:25:32,Twokinds,It summons things from the mansion's stockpile.
01-02-2019T00:25:51,MrEase,okay
01-02-2019T00:25:51,totallynotTrace,thats good
01-02-2019T00:26:07,InTheLionsDen,Better than converting part of the life force of the person asking to generate the item(s) requested.
01-02-2019T00:26:07,Tharkis,and tom's pizzaria
01-02-2019T00:26:28,SageSaga,"""Son, this is the last loaf of bread in the village, eat it, and sleep well... do not look for me, this is goodbye, my gift to you... is this last meal"" *Bread vanishes* Maren - ""Sweet, perfect for the sandwich"""
01-02-2019T00:26:46,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
01-02-2019T00:26:47,totallynotTrace,"wouldnt want to summon a pizza and somehwere, a pizzas just been put on a table and right before a slice is taken *POOF*"
01-02-2019T00:27:06,Twokinds,lol
01-02-2019T00:27:18,CrimsonHelsing,"@TwoKinds Another question about this page in particular. Why did they end up here? As the mansion's form of automatic punishment for being in restricted areas, or did Rose choose for them to go there?"
01-02-2019T00:27:21,Twokinds,That's hilarious Sage
01-02-2019T00:27:24,MrEase,damn that has further dark implications
01-02-2019T00:27:36,SageSaga,i am a funny guy
01-02-2019T00:27:49,MrEase,when combined with Nora's tresspasser curse
01-02-2019T00:27:59,MrEase,which was disturbing enough as is
01-02-2019T00:28:05,MrEase,aaaaa my brain
01-02-2019T00:28:14,Twokinds,The tables can't make anything
01-02-2019T00:28:21,Twokinds,So all food has to be prepared ahead of time
01-02-2019T00:28:22,totallynotTrace,darn
01-02-2019T00:28:37,Twokinds,"Normally, the manor has a full kitchen staff"
01-02-2019T00:29:10,totallynotTrace,"and now isnt normally, im assuming"
01-02-2019T00:29:25,Twokinds,The manor employed at one point probably a hundred or more poeple.
01-02-2019T00:29:59,Twokinds,Most of them lived in cottages nearby.
01-02-2019T00:31:25,totallynotTrace,"I whent to a large mansion in Rhode island thats been turned into a museum, called The Breakers, and most of the servants when it was a house lived in the attic basically"
01-02-2019T00:31:50,Twokinds,That's what Rose's job as seneschal was - hiring and maintaining the manor staff.
01-02-2019T00:32:21,Twokinds,"When I say they live in cottages nearby, I mean the cottages are on the estate's grounds."
01-02-2019T00:32:21,unsteddyphoenix,not a bad living tbh
01-02-2019T00:32:43,totallynotTrace,definately worse positions
01-02-2019T00:32:59,MrEase,still super freaked out about the door curse implications
01-02-2019T00:33:08,Twokinds,This was one of them
01-02-2019T00:33:08,MrEase,I don't think I'm ever gonna get over that
01-02-2019T00:33:15,BluePhantom90,So what does Trace have tons and tons of money that he doesn't have to work?
01-02-2019T00:33:18,totallynotTrace,WHAAT when did this get done
01-02-2019T00:33:20,Tharkis,"i like that cottage, looks cozy"
01-02-2019T00:33:26,totallynotTrace,that looks amazing
01-02-2019T00:33:37,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"not gonna lie, would love a little stone hut like that"
01-02-2019T00:33:53,MrEase,"thats from the page when they are traveling in the carriage with Lt Reed, right?"
01-02-2019T00:34:02,Twokinds,Yeah
01-02-2019T00:34:47,totallynotTrace,and thats how dragons drink XD
01-02-2019T00:34:58,Apostrophe,Reni drinking from the fountain is one of my favorite sight gags
01-02-2019T00:35:15,MrEase,so does the mansion have animals that aren't cursed...
01-02-2019T00:36:08,MrEase,because that turkey that Nat and Keith ate... uhhh combined with the door curse and the fact that the tables only summon from the mansion grounds...
01-02-2019T00:36:26,totallynotTrace,better question: does it have anything that isnt in some way magical?
01-02-2019T00:36:26,MrEase,has some twisted implications that have me wanting to gag
01-02-2019T00:36:57,totallynotTrace,oh thats what your talking about
01-02-2019T00:37:20,totallynotTrace,yeah slightly messed up
01-02-2019T00:37:31,MrEase,I mean the door curse is already disturbing
01-02-2019T00:37:44,MrEase,just for tresspassing you spend your entire life as livestock
01-02-2019T00:38:07,totallynotTrace,I feel bad for Bob
01-02-2019T00:38:32,InTheLionsDen,Don't worry about it. If you don't want the turkey just have some of these Soylent Green chips.
01-02-2019T00:38:55,MrEase,and I don't know if its more or less disturbing if the conscience of the victim remains in the animal or if the animals mind takes over
01-02-2019T00:39:43,totallynotTrace,Oh you expect me to believe those chips werent alive before ariving at the mansion?
01-02-2019T00:40:18,Zakuru,dem girls can slip out of them bars!
01-02-2019T00:40:49,BluePhantom90,"I have been wondering Tom, the Tiger caravans, would some allow humans to join them if they so wished?"
01-02-2019T00:40:50,totallynotTrace,I was imagining its the same soul of the person but with the mental capabilities limited to that of the animal they become
01-02-2019T00:41:44,Twokinds,No not usually
01-02-2019T00:41:56,Twokinds,"I mean, unless they were a servant."
01-02-2019T00:42:03,BluePhantom90,hmm
01-02-2019T00:42:23,Twokinds,"I mean, maybe, but in general, tigers are isolationist."
01-02-2019T00:42:44,Twokinds,Obviously there are always individuals that deviate from the norm.
01-02-2019T00:44:26,unsteddyphoenix,deviants
01-02-2019T00:44:27,BluePhantom90,"I mean if they allowed some humans to join them, they could use the humans a fronts to go into Human villages or lands to get supplies and form trade"
01-02-2019T00:45:36,BluePhantom90,"I mean they Tigers do eat a lot of meat, and if they can skin their hunts they would have a lot of fur to trade"
01-02-2019T00:50:12,unsteddyphoenix,Only wolves have human slaves right?
01-02-2019T00:50:19,unsteddyphoenix,Or do tigers also
01-02-2019T00:50:29,BluePhantom90,Tigers have servants
01-02-2019T00:50:35,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"equality, everyone is a slave"
01-02-2019T00:51:11,TorqueEmUp,Wolves have other wolves as Slaves I believe.
01-02-2019T00:51:39,Twokinds,Humans are less common among tigers
01-02-2019T00:52:10,Zakuru,no one is innocent :upside_down:
01-02-2019T00:52:52,BluePhantom90,"Oh idea Tom, If Holo from ""spice and wolf"" were to teleport in Twokinds. would she b worshiped as a god?"
01-02-2019T00:53:17,unsteddyphoenix,Ah but it still exists.
01-02-2019T00:53:31,unsteddyphoenix,Whats tigers...main...slaves? Other tigers?
01-02-2019T00:54:10,BluePhantom90,most likely the males. Since the women are in charge

01-02-2019T00:56:09,Twokinds,Tigers generally don't use slaves
01-02-2019T00:56:21,Twokinds,Compared to humans and wolves
01-02-2019T00:58:20,Twokinds,"Tigers do have very weird social structures, though, as far as servants go. It's pretty alien to anything humans have/"
01-02-2019T01:00:12,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah thats what I remembered
01-02-2019T01:02:19,Fjellrev,Hey there!

01-02-2019T01:48:26,Bgrmystr2,I was catching up w/ a friend I hadn't talked to in a proper conversation since more than 12 or 13 years ago.
01-02-2019T01:48:34,Twokinds,I've had the same conversation
01-02-2019T01:48:51,unsteddyphoenix,So like
01-02-2019T01:48:51,Twokinds,I can't believe people still don't understand how their own taxes work.
01-02-2019T01:48:59,Bgrmystr2,"lol, do bonuses not affect tax brackets?"
01-02-2019T01:49:01,unsteddyphoenix,The bonus would make him lose money? :thinking:
01-02-2019T01:49:19,Combak,"No, it's just not how tax brackets work."
01-02-2019T01:49:34,Combak,You're only taxed on the money that puts you above the bracket.
01-02-2019T01:49:40,Bgrmystr2,I never had bonuses or whatnot never needed to mess with that kinda thing
01-02-2019T01:49:50,Combak,And only on the money above the bracket.
01-02-2019T01:50:10,Ordithus,"Bonuses are withheld at a higher level, but you get that back with the return"
01-02-2019T01:51:19,Combak,"AKA taxed at 25% at $50000, 10% at anything less. If you earn $50001, you pay $5000.25."
01-02-2019T01:51:28,SageSaga,my old boss stopped giving out bonuses and instead opted to do a work party
01-02-2019T01:51:44,Ordithus,That better be one amazing party
01-02-2019T01:52:02,SageSaga,it wasnt
01-02-2019T01:53:00,SageSaga,the only interesting thing about it was seeing my bosses home and how he spends the money he could have used to pay us a little more
01-02-2019T01:53:26,Ordithus,ouch
01-02-2019T01:54:15,SageSaga,"when you have a room full of luger pistols, submachine guns and tons of other guns and knives from WW2..."

01-02-2019T01:55:54,SageSaga,he had like 8-10 of every year of lugar during the war
01-02-2019T01:56:43,Combak,Well then.
01-02-2019T01:56:55,SageSaga,what worried me a bit was the Nazi flag- it wasnt on display though really it was just kinda folded up in the display box
01-02-2019T01:57:17,Ordithus,uhhh

01-02-2019T14:07:24,RimaDraws,i may replay through all the previous games
01-02-2019T14:07:45,RimaDraws,starting with birth by sleep
01-02-2019T14:08:05,RimaDraws,i think i will keep my suggestion ive had for a few weeks. I still wanna try it out
01-02-2019T14:10:35,Dadrobit,Only ever played the first two. Haven't touched one in ten years. The game has enough exposition dumps that I can parse it out.
01-02-2019T14:11:17,RimaDraws,i have all of them except Dream Drop Distance and 2.8 on the ps4
01-02-2019T14:11:33,RimaDraws,i still gotta get my behind through all of them.
01-02-2019T14:11:47,RimaDraws,but BBS is a good way to start its on the psp
01-02-2019T14:12:17,RimaDraws,i can definitely say i loved playing as Aqua
01-02-2019T14:32:08,SpazztasticKiwi,I stayed up till 3 watching Subnautica
01-02-2019T14:32:53,RimaDraws,i think i stayed up till 5 then dozed off again
01-02-2019T14:32:57,SpazztasticKiwi,But at least I know Seán’s ready to be eaten by the new reaper
01-02-2019T14:33:32,RimaDraws,jacksepticeye?
01-02-2019T14:33:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Yep
01-02-2019T14:34:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Binged the first three. His newest is up today
01-02-2019T14:34:24,Dadrobit,Fear the reaper man.
01-02-2019T14:35:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Mark was so tense his neck is gonna become nonexistent if he keeps it up
01-02-2019T14:36:54,RimaDraws,hmm
01-02-2019T14:38:45,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s so much pretty though

01-02-2019T15:21:33,sunblaze,yo crimson
01-02-2019T15:21:48,Bgrmystr2,"Hey sage, I was watching a clip sometime recently about an anime where everyone was getting their magic abilities rated and the MC (I think) could only use like.. defensive magic? Or it was weak or someshit.. like it was just unheard of"
01-02-2019T15:21:56,Bgrmystr2,and I dunno what show it was
01-02-2019T15:22:03,Bgrmystr2,I can't find the clip anymore
01-02-2019T15:22:19,Bgrmystr2,does it sound familiar at all? :thinking:
01-02-2019T15:22:30,CrimsonQuill,Can't say it does.
01-02-2019T15:22:40,Bgrmystr2,"well you're not sage, so there's that."
01-02-2019T15:22:41,SageSaga,need more details
01-02-2019T15:23:08,Bgrmystr2,"it was probably recentish, within the past 3-4 years, but I don't know much more than that."
01-02-2019T15:23:14,SageSaga,were they wearing school uniforms?
01-02-2019T15:23:24,Bgrmystr2,uh.. yeah I think so?
01-02-2019T15:23:40,SageSaga,unfortunately that only narrows it down to like 10 i can think of
01-02-2019T15:23:49,CrimsonQuill,Am I the only person who find it odd that no sketch request notification has been sent?
01-02-2019T15:23:51,Bgrmystr2,wow there's that many
01-02-2019T15:23:54,SageSaga,and i havent seen all of them yet

01-02-2019T15:24:39,CrimsonQuill,Just spent the last half hour watching the pilot of the new Rooster Teeth series Gen Lock.
01-02-2019T15:24:48,Bgrmystr2,hmm..
01-02-2019T15:25:23,SageSaga,look up the irregular at magic school
01-02-2019T15:26:26,SageSaga,"he's one of those ""omg his magic power is so weak"" but actually he's completely OP bull crap that it makes the show boring"
01-02-2019T15:26:40,Bgrmystr2,lool
01-02-2019T15:26:54,sunblaze,sadly that true and yes to the boring part

01-02-2019T15:29:40,sunblaze,that does sounds like it yeah
01-02-2019T15:29:44,SageSaga,well did you look it up?
01-02-2019T15:30:16,SageSaga,or are you one of those weird people that cant tell major style differences?
01-02-2019T15:30:45,Bgrmystr2,"Well I dunno how to look that up? I mean I can't just search ""That clip where the dude from that anime finds out he has garbage magic power when everyone else's magic is broken"""
01-02-2019T15:31:06,Bgrmystr2,and it was a long time ago so I don't actually recall much of the art of it
01-02-2019T15:31:11,sunblaze,"""irregular at magic school"" is a title of the anime"
01-02-2019T15:31:17,Bgrmystr2,it came to me last night when I was laying in bed honestly
01-02-2019T15:32:03,SageSaga,yeah i was saying look up Irregular at magic school and see if it was familiar
01-02-2019T15:32:55,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, I've been told about that anime before, so I can't really use that as a basis cuz I see it from time to time, I'd have to see the clip where they're revealing what magic he has"
01-02-2019T15:32:59,Bgrmystr2,but I can't find it
01-02-2019T15:34:30,SageSaga,so its impossible to tell what it is from what you have described because its a legit trope :P
01-02-2019T15:35:26,Bgrmystr2,yeah... I know

01-02-2019T15:48:24,Bgrmystr2,Well I had to just look up the first episode of irregular of magic high school but the clip I'm thinking of isn't there.
01-02-2019T15:48:30,Mippy,Tom and Sage are both safe but everyone else is on the chopping block.

01-02-2019T15:57:41,SageSaga,yeah i'm gonna fix it later - focusing on the backgrounds atm
01-02-2019T15:57:58,BadFoMo,"Also, Sage: Fate! Y U do this?!"
01-02-2019T15:58:05,BadFoMo,Cool.

01-02-2019T16:00:38,SpazztasticKiwi,I have little clue as to what else is going on here
01-02-2019T16:00:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve been streaming YouTube
01-02-2019T16:00:58,sunblaze,1) petreon is currently down and in maintance
01-02-2019T16:01:00,BadFoMo,"Money problems, maybe?"
01-02-2019T16:01:11,SpazztasticKiwi,I know it’s down I was here for that
01-02-2019T16:01:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Though my app seems to be ok - loading
01-02-2019T16:01:37,sunblaze,2) some patreons (including myself) are way to generous and need a regular viw over all the pledges that summed up.
01-02-2019T16:01:46,sunblaze,sometimes that means reducing/chopping some
01-02-2019T16:02:22,SpazztasticKiwi,So they’re wanting you to restrict tier rewards
01-02-2019T16:02:43,sunblaze,what? no restric yourself becuase money is (sadly) not limitless
01-02-2019T16:03:19,BadFoMo,//Troll Kaylin has gas in that panel?
01-02-2019T16:03:34,sunblaze,^hahaha can not unsee!

01-02-2019T16:11:37,CrimsonQuill,I think that my suggestion this week should be something Lore related....
01-02-2019T16:11:43,Aphala,Just sitting here...waiting for infinite

01-02-2019T16:12:24,CrimsonQuill,"Well, Halo, Twokinds and Undertale are my big influences at present."
01-02-2019T16:12:34,CrimsonQuill,"Unfortunately, Skyrim is devouring my soul."
01-02-2019T16:12:44,CrimsonQuill,I spent 10 hours playing it overall yesterday.

01-02-2019T16:15:06,CrimsonQuill,"Pressed a button, like Caboose."
01-02-2019T16:15:13,CrimsonQuill,"""What does this button do?"""
01-02-2019T16:15:20,CatzArt,Ah but thats for science. blowing things up is okay for science

01-02-2019T16:16:22,Bgrmystr2,it's from the RWBY soundtrack
01-02-2019T16:16:25,CrimsonQuill,"I have Portal 2's ATLAS beside me right now, so I'm making science at this very moment."

01-02-2019T16:17:14,CrimsonQuill,It only took me 5 seconds into the first to realise that they had Jen Taylor (aka Halsey and Cortana) as the narrator...
01-02-2019T16:17:15,Bgrmystr2,"yeah I recall the song, but this was the slow one"
01-02-2019T16:17:19,CrimsonQuill,Thanks Sage
01-02-2019T16:17:20,Bgrmystr2,wasn't really a fan of it
01-02-2019T16:17:52,CatzArt,"Yeah that show is next on my anime list. I just finished Space Battleship Yamato 2199, the english version called star blazers"

01-02-2019T16:20:21,CatzArt,I cant remember the specifics But I heard gender politics were involved and I stayed as far away as possible.
01-02-2019T16:20:28,sunblaze,cellos are a blast

01-02-2019T16:21:01,sunblaze,thats news to me as well
01-02-2019T16:21:15,CrimsonQuill,What's news?
01-02-2019T16:21:16,CatzArt,I was percussion in band. I hit things with sticks. I hope its just baseless rumor but I'm to nervous to look
01-02-2019T16:21:27,CatzArt,get it base?
01-02-2019T16:21:29,SageSaga,stupid autoplaying netflix
01-02-2019T16:21:30,CrimsonQuill,LOL
01-02-2019T16:21:58,Bgrmystr2,..well that explains where the sound came from
01-02-2019T16:22:14,sunblaze,the fact that Cowboy bebop is gender involved
01-02-2019T16:22:17,CatzArt,I just hope its a baseless rumor and I'm worried for nothing
01-02-2019T16:22:30,CrimsonQuill,I'm just going to watch it.
01-02-2019T16:22:42,sunblaze,I am going to watch my dvd to confirm D:

01-02-2019T16:22:58,CrimsonQuill,Plus giant freaking robots.
01-02-2019T16:23:03,CrimsonQuill,GIANT. FREAKING. ROBOTS.
01-02-2019T16:23:10,SageSaga,Cowboy Bebop isnt on netflix yet
01-02-2019T16:23:11,CrimsonQuill,What more reason do I need?
01-02-2019T16:23:35,CatzArt,It might bee related to the live action version they are making
01-02-2019T16:23:38,CrimsonQuill,The first thing I saw of Cowboy Bebop was some bad-arse fight scene.
01-02-2019T16:23:47,CrimsonQuill,The Second was Ein tripping on mushrooms
01-02-2019T16:24:08,CatzArt,Quill the music is one of the best parts. Can you play some for quill Sage?
01-02-2019T16:24:20,SageSaga,i dont have any of it
01-02-2019T16:24:31,CrimsonQuill,It's ok Catz
01-02-2019T16:24:48,CatzArt,aww a shame. Sax Quartet is my favorite song from the show
01-02-2019T16:25:02,CatzArt,and space lion
01-02-2019T16:25:02,CrimsonQuill,I can look it up.
01-02-2019T16:25:38,CrimsonQuill,I remember I spent a little time clipping the bit from that sketch stream when Halo Raine was drawn and adding the CE theme as music...
01-02-2019T16:25:45,CrimsonQuill,"Music just give me such joy,"
01-02-2019T16:25:53,CrimsonQuill,"When it plays, I can see all sorts of things."
01-02-2019T16:25:54,SageSaga,its like you have the internet too or something
01-02-2019T16:25:56,SageSaga,crazy
01-02-2019T16:26:05,Bgrmystr2,"what, sage no that's silly"
01-02-2019T16:26:08,Bgrmystr2,it's just you.
01-02-2019T16:26:17,BadFoMo,The Seatbelts did a good job on the music.
01-02-2019T16:26:27,CrimsonQuill,"Phil Collin's ""Testify"" makes me think about...an echoey, bluish cloudy pulsy light thing."
01-02-2019T16:26:37,CrimsonQuill,I don't know how to describe it.
01-02-2019T16:26:39,CatzArt,And Sage it makes me so happy that you've drawn a sword of realistic sword. Not a giant fantasy sword. many thanks
01-02-2019T16:27:08,SageSaga,dont thank me yet- there are unrealistic swords- it is a game :P
01-02-2019T16:27:24,Bgrmystr2,and then Catz proceeds to eat their foot haha
01-02-2019T16:27:31,SageSaga,but her main weapons are normal looking - they are actually transmogged to look normal
01-02-2019T16:27:31,CrimsonQuill,Has anyone noticed that the SKyrim Iron and Steel weapons are fairly realistic?
01-02-2019T16:27:36,CrimsonQuill,Niiic
01-02-2019T16:27:38,CrimsonQuill,Niiice
01-02-2019T16:27:43,CrimsonQuill,Damned spelling!
01-02-2019T16:27:47,CatzArt,The iron is the steel sword as alot of issues
01-02-2019T16:27:48,CrimsonQuill,I keep making typing errors.
01-02-2019T16:27:59,Bgrmystr2,"you should probably fix that, quill"
01-02-2019T16:28:04,CrimsonQuill,Yeah...
01-02-2019T16:28:10,CrimsonQuill,Type more carefully for one thing.
01-02-2019T16:28:14,CrimsonQuill,I rush a lot.
01-02-2019T16:28:19,CrimsonQuill,Trying to say something...
01-02-2019T16:28:46,SageSaga,im getting some slow down in clip that is odd
01-02-2019T16:28:54,Bgrmystr2,memorizing the keyboard layout moreso than you do now and having a place to keep your hands as you type also helps.
01-02-2019T16:28:57,CatzArt,THE steel sword has a few issues with blade thickness and the handle biend two narrow which would lead to the tang breaking. NO Catz stop. Now is not the time for a sword rant
01-02-2019T16:29:05,SageSaga,OH
01-02-2019T16:29:09,SageSaga,its not clip!
01-02-2019T16:29:12,SageSaga,ITS NETFLIX

01-02-2019T16:29:55,SageSaga,having netflix open in a tab always screws loading in everything on for some reason
01-02-2019T16:30:04,CrimsonQuill,It's just something you DO.
01-02-2019T16:30:41,BadFoMo,A little late as per the norm.

01-02-2019T16:36:22,CatzArt,By the way Quill were you able to see any of the Super Wolf Blood Moon a while back? I stayed up till 2 am waiting for the cloud cover to clear and I saw a bit of it for a while
01-02-2019T16:36:59,CrimsonQuill,"I stayed up late, but unfortunately I (A) needed sleep and (B) had to deal with clouds."
01-02-2019T16:37:15,CrimsonQuill,And whenever I pull an all-nighter I feel like a cowpat for the rest of the day.
01-02-2019T16:37:28,CatzArt,A shame. did you watch any of it on a live stream?
01-02-2019T16:37:36,CrimsonQuill,"Ummm, nope."

01-02-2019T16:44:19,CrimsonQuill,"Oh, I do want."
01-02-2019T16:44:21,sunblaze,only eveil if you fail to count
01-02-2019T16:44:23,BadFoMo,1... 2... 5!
01-02-2019T16:44:34,sunblaze,^like this :D
01-02-2019T16:44:40,SageSaga,i'll be taking control of Fluffs character
01-02-2019T16:44:48,CatzArt,First though shall pull thy holy pin
01-02-2019T16:44:54,CrimsonQuill,What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?
01-02-2019T16:44:57,Bgrmystr2,"you can keep those damn grenades, cuz they will murder you and everyone around you no matter how far you run or how much you hide behind"
01-02-2019T16:45:03,SageSaga,and Goblin slayer doesnt really subvert D&D
01-02-2019T16:45:27,BadFoMo,...Is it Afracan or Europian?
01-02-2019T16:45:31,sunblaze,indeed those wacho player ideas are missing
01-02-2019T16:45:51,CatzArt,I dont know (auggh! gets thrown into giant pit)
01-02-2019T16:45:55,SageSaga,GS is the Wacho player
01-02-2019T16:46:06,CatzArt,The what?
01-02-2019T16:46:10,SageSaga,wacko*
01-02-2019T16:46:12,CrimsonQuill,Which sort? The African of the European one?
01-02-2019T16:46:27,CatzArt,European of course
01-02-2019T16:46:37,sunblaze,well yes sage but just one
01-02-2019T16:47:05,CatzArt,How could a 1oz swallow carry a one pound coconut?
01-02-2019T16:47:14,CrimsonQuill,I don't know that.
01-02-2019T16:47:14,sunblaze,a regular D6D round ha ALL players being irnorant/stupid/wacko/silly/a moron/reckless
01-02-2019T16:47:19,sunblaze,depending on mood
01-02-2019T16:47:28,SageSaga,i disagree
01-02-2019T16:48:07,CatzArt,I feel like I was supposed to be doing something and got distracted
01-02-2019T16:48:39,sunblaze,"maybe I play the wrong crwod. but seriousness usally dies after like the third evening and they either behave like an idiot, an ass or are jsut plain silly"
01-02-2019T16:49:04,CatzArt,I check wench for traps
01-02-2019T16:49:10,SageSaga,if everyone is dying you probably had a dick DM
01-02-2019T16:49:29,sunblaze,oh you got that wrong
01-02-2019T16:49:34,sunblaze,the DM is jsut like that :D
01-02-2019T16:49:49,CatzArt,I check barmaid for traps
01-02-2019T16:50:00,CrimsonQuill,I wish I could play D and D
01-02-2019T16:50:02,sunblaze,but yes if they play for real they would have an easy time
01-02-2019T16:50:34,sunblaze,@CatzArt trap barmaid = best barmaid :D
01-02-2019T16:50:50,BadFoMo,"""Frelik jumps into the pit to gather the treasher! How much does Frelik get?!"""
01-02-2019T16:50:50,SageSaga,how am i wrong?
01-02-2019T16:51:24,sunblaze,the GM is not a dick. he is involved in the silliness
01-02-2019T16:51:52,sunblaze,so rarely anyone dies despite like a million of opportunities
01-02-2019T16:51:58,SageSaga,killing off characters for fun isnt silly - its doing a bad job
01-02-2019T16:52:10,CrimsonQuill,Not to mention Sadistic
01-02-2019T16:52:22,BadFoMo,Do NPCs count?
01-02-2019T16:52:28,sunblaze,yes they do!
01-02-2019T16:53:08,sunblaze,depsite the fact it might be sometimes nessesary to push the group in a certain direction
01-02-2019T16:54:46,SageSaga,i had a character in the last game i tried to use for a big adventure hook
01-02-2019T16:54:47,sunblaze,"after all all players as well as the NPC's ""should"" have a background, a lot of work involved and killing them just because lulz kills off the roleplay that could be involved in them."
01-02-2019T16:55:01,SageSaga,he burried the hook like a dog with a pile of bones
01-02-2019T16:55:27,SageSaga,i had to dig a lot to get them back on that hook
01-02-2019T16:56:02,SageSaga,"i even said ""Wow you buried that hook"" and he said ""Wait- what does that mean?"""
01-02-2019T16:56:11,SageSaga,so i had to explain adventuring hooks
01-02-2019T16:56:21,sunblaze,.... oh my
01-02-2019T16:56:22,SageSaga,and i gave this example
01-02-2019T16:57:11,SageSaga,"""Let's say you are playing and you are all in a tavern and i send in a plot hook as a man that runs in and says ""Please! someone help! I've been robbed! All my money is gone! My wife and children will starve!"""
01-02-2019T16:58:16,SageSaga,"""and instead of going out to help track down the thief and go on an adventure you just walk up to the man and say 'here is 100 gold, problem solved' and sit back down at the table 'waiting for adventure' to come your way..."""
01-02-2019T16:58:31,CatzArt,Ha!
01-02-2019T16:58:52,sunblaze,well it worked somehow :D
01-02-2019T16:59:02,SageSaga,"and he was like ""huh... I just kinda did that didnt i?"""
01-02-2019T16:59:04,FoxxTrotter,:fox:
01-02-2019T16:59:52,BadFoMo,Sounds like something I would do.
01-02-2019T17:00:17,SageSaga,"and then i was like ""So- do you tell anyone else about what you found out now?"" ""Nah im just going to keep that to myself"" *facepalm* ""Hey- you ran out of space for those books in your study- you should take them to the library- where Mihari is"""
01-02-2019T17:00:57,NibblyBot,New Comic Page: The Dungeons http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/1055/

01-02-2019T17:01:22,CrimsonQuill,"Well, I'm going to head,,"
01-02-2019T17:01:27,CrimsonQuill,I need to shower and sleep.
01-02-2019T17:01:30,CrimsonQuill,Goodnight!

01-02-2019T17:01:46,FoxxTrotter,"G'night, Crimson."
01-02-2019T17:01:58,sunblaze,well at least it got you a funny story and a facepalm sage :P
01-02-2019T17:02:23,CatzArt,I will refrain from making the night quill joke for the hundredth time
01-02-2019T17:03:26,SageSaga,"""Maddie, im 34, your mother is twice my height- shes like 12 feet tall right? Pretty sure shes 12 feet tall..."""
01-02-2019T17:04:31,CrRAR,ooo
01-02-2019T17:04:37,CatzArt,Are you referring to adelaide?
01-02-2019T17:04:42,CrRAR,:ptv-excited:
01-02-2019T17:04:53,SageSaga,uhh- yeah
01-02-2019T17:05:01,SageSaga,who else would Maddie's mom be?
01-02-2019T17:05:36,BadFoMo,...Maddie the 1st?
01-02-2019T17:05:51,SageSaga,thats probably her grandma?
01-02-2019T17:05:55,CatzArt,yup
01-02-2019T17:06:06,Bgrmystr2,canonical information is so difficult to come by.... :ptv-confused:
01-02-2019T17:06:07,CatzArt,well we finally get maddie's age!
01-02-2019T17:06:29,SageSaga,shes only one year older than Karen- but they are both too young to lewd still
01-02-2019T17:06:43,Xexanoth,like that ever stopped anybody
01-02-2019T17:06:52,CatzArt,I wish it would
01-02-2019T17:06:55,SageSaga,TOO YOUNG TO LEWD
01-02-2019T17:06:57,BadFoMo,It stops me.
01-02-2019T17:07:06,CatzArt,stop lewding the characters dangit!
01-02-2019T17:07:20,Bgrmystr2,gonna agree w/ xex on this one
01-02-2019T17:07:25,Bgrmystr2,that's not gonna stop anyone.
01-02-2019T17:07:31,sunblaze,well flora was pregnant for like 12 RL years and several loooong month in the comic
01-02-2019T17:07:44,sunblaze,it will happen jsut give it another 12-15 years IRT :D
01-02-2019T17:08:03,BadFoMo,"Weird things like TF on the other hand, I see no age limit."
01-02-2019T17:08:28,CatzArt,Ha! well get there. didnt we have a side comic with that one guard getting together with a tiger keidran and having a kid?
01-02-2019T17:08:38,BadFoMo,Yes.
01-02-2019T17:08:45,sunblaze,yess that was the newest one
01-02-2019T17:09:25,BadFoMo,We also have one where Maeve is holding her child.
01-02-2019T17:09:43,CatzArt,There is an age limit FoMo. no touching the minor age characters in any way! Or I will reach through the interwebs and smack ye with a rolled up newspaper
01-02-2019T17:10:19,BadFoMo,What's wrong with Transformation and age limits?
01-02-2019T17:11:00,sunblaze,depends remember the antro-nibbly pics?
01-02-2019T17:11:07,CatzArt,I feel that gender bending TFs on minors isnt right. Species change is fine though..i think.. still on the fence about that one
01-02-2019T17:11:15,sunblaze,technically noone knows her age yet lewd
01-02-2019T17:11:20,Xexanoth,"the whole problem with drawn characters is that you could jsut go: well they're aged up by 1 or 2 years, without actually having to show any difference"
01-02-2019T17:11:47,sunblaze,flora was 8 when the comic startes as well (yet legit)
01-02-2019T17:11:55,Xexanoth,"unless the character is obviously underage, it's not like anyone can tell the difference"
01-02-2019T17:11:58,BadFoMo,I genrally don't do TG. TF is my thing.
01-02-2019T17:12:14,CatzArt,I know but that seems to indulge fan service more than anything. Yes but FLora is a keidran and ages differently than humans
01-02-2019T17:12:47,Xexanoth,"also i just noticed the chicken in the dungeon, guess rose got her wish"
01-02-2019T17:13:39,RimaDraws,back i took a nap
01-02-2019T17:13:42,SageSaga,"""Dont lewd!"" ""I didnt - i just drew the character?"" ""Oh no- i lewded the character in my mind!"" *DOOOOOM*"
01-02-2019T17:13:43,BadFoMo,Yo.
01-02-2019T17:13:46,CatzArt,Oh yeah I see that Xex. keep it way from the new snep explorer

01-02-2019T17:15:50,sunblaze,can not be worse then chocolate-pizza
01-02-2019T17:15:55,CatzArt,Ive had breakfast pizza before its not so bad
01-02-2019T17:16:01,RimaDraws,ive had that! its great!

01-02-2019T17:17:07,CatzArt,Is CiCi's still a thing? I havent seen one in Ohio in years
01-02-2019T17:17:20,FoxxTrotter,They have CiCi's here in NC.
01-02-2019T17:17:29,RimaDraws,i havent been to one in years
01-02-2019T17:17:51,RimaDraws,i loved their pizza buffet
01-02-2019T17:17:58,BadFoMo,"Anyway, I'm not into under-aged TG or fanservice. TF (like Rock-A-Dodeal and Whitches) is as far is I go."
01-02-2019T17:18:11,Bgrmystr2,the CiCi's we had around here I liked to go to closed down. :ptv-uneasy:

01-02-2019T17:19:03,FoxxTrotter,We also have a Milton's Pizza here was well.
01-02-2019T17:19:08,Bgrmystr2,I think it's across the river
01-02-2019T17:19:25,Ognimod,Gotta go to alleviate some of the strain on the bandwidth and the laptop's processor. Take care =)
01-02-2019T17:19:28,Bgrmystr2,"Don't have that, Foxx, never heard of it, even.."

01-02-2019T17:20:33,FoxxTrotter,"Milton's is only local here, but they are pretty good. :0)"
01-02-2019T17:20:40,RimaDraws,now i want pizza

01-02-2019T17:21:43,RimaDraws,also @Sagesaga this looks great
01-02-2019T17:22:16,BadFoMo,"@CatzArt Sorry, I must ask; what happened?"
01-02-2019T17:22:56,SageSaga,ty Rima
01-02-2019T17:23:20,Rosscoe,Evening folks!

01-02-2019T17:24:39,RimaDraws,yw sage ^^
01-02-2019T17:25:49,CatzArt,"Oh okay fomo, rmember when Evals was talking about going home and t showed an image of his childhood friends and familye/ Well in the chat some people were talking about how they would name them and take them home as pets and that bothered me greatly."
01-02-2019T17:26:14,SageSaga,XD
01-02-2019T17:26:18,BadFoMo,Ah. Thanks.
01-02-2019T17:26:22,SageSaga,holy crap Catz - yeah thats messed up
01-02-2019T17:26:31,CatzArt,Mabey its because child kidnapping is a problem in Ohio around my area and that hit to close to home for me
01-02-2019T17:26:48,BadFoMo,Oh...
01-02-2019T17:26:52,BadFoMo,Sorry.
01-02-2019T17:27:04,CatzArt,Sorry to bring the chat down lets switch the subject
01-02-2019T17:27:06,SageSaga,i think even without that connection that's messed up because Evals is a SLAVE
01-02-2019T17:27:35,sunblaze,^that
01-02-2019T17:27:36,SageSaga,"""Oh yeah- look at his family! I'd buy that one"""
01-02-2019T17:27:36,BadFoMo,Yes;lets change it.
01-02-2019T17:28:01,CatzArt,Well if Tom's goal was to get readers like me to sympathize with the Keidran. It worked
01-02-2019T17:28:20,BadFoMo,Dude: My hand! How will I spend my time off now?!
01-02-2019T17:28:37,sunblaze,could be toms secret masterplan!
01-02-2019T17:28:54,SageSaga,Bad - he has men for t- ooooh- not anymore
01-02-2019T17:28:59,sunblaze,granted it probably worked after like the very first comicpage
01-02-2019T17:29:03,CrRAR,#freethekeidran!
01-02-2019T17:29:14,CatzArt,But yeah Sage what story arc is this taking place in? Im still lost somewhere in the bowels of Yosh so I dont really now where I'm at
01-02-2019T17:29:36,CatzArt,#FreetheKeidran
01-02-2019T17:29:43,SageSaga,well this is Chapter 5 of Artificial Incident
01-02-2019T17:29:45,sunblaze,"that ""artificial incident"" an additional comic"
01-02-2019T17:30:24,CatzArt,"Ah, I think I'm simply at the part where sage is starting to consistantly color the comics:ptv-laugh:"
01-02-2019T17:30:47,SageSaga,o_o... you are only like 100 pages into yosh
01-02-2019T17:30:55,SageSaga,which is currently 2171 pages

01-02-2019T17:31:37,sunblaze,oh my has it beeen THAT many?
01-02-2019T17:31:38,sunblaze,neat
01-02-2019T17:32:35,CatzArt,"I'm juggling about ten different web comics at the moment. Beyond the western deep, Twokinds, Yosh, SuperCell, DreamKeepers and a few others. so spacing out time for all of them is hard"
01-02-2019T17:33:09,sunblaze,dreamkeepers was to confusing for me. that jumping around the storylines was not my style :8
01-02-2019T17:34:50,CatzArt,I really like the Dreamkeepers art style tough. Its pretty unique. although that comic I would say is 18+ with come of its content
01-02-2019T17:35:27,CatzArt,Have you ever read Beyond the Western deep Sunblaze?
01-02-2019T17:35:38,sunblaze,not that I remember
01-02-2019T17:36:37,CatzArt,Its more of a Redwall inspired comic. Medieval fantasy with talking animals
01-02-2019T17:36:49,sunblaze,I'll check it out thanks
01-02-2019T17:37:09,sunblaze,curretnly started skin deep
01-02-2019T17:37:14,sunblaze,becuase mythic stuff :D
01-02-2019T17:37:18,CatzArt,skin deep?
01-02-2019T17:37:55,Bgrmystr2,lel only 10 comics and you have issues with that?
01-02-2019T17:38:17,sunblaze,yeah I was at 300+ at my best times.
01-02-2019T17:38:27,sunblaze,currently arount 80 more gets confusing :D
01-02-2019T17:39:06,CatzArt,I only ever really read webcomics. But jeeze 300+ I could never keep up!
01-02-2019T17:40:24,CatzArt,"Oh yeah sage. If you ever want some references for some crazy, historical sword designs I can recommend a website to look on. thanks sun Ill take a look at Skin Deep"
01-02-2019T17:40:51,Bgrmystr2,"I'm probably only reading 30 or 40 webcomics, but I have a couple hundred manga I've already read plus moreso I plan to read, it's a constant thing."
01-02-2019T17:40:58,Bgrmystr2,most of em aren't ongoing though
01-02-2019T17:41:25,sunblaze,yeah I usally read 5-6 books all at once.
01-02-2019T17:41:26,Bgrmystr2,just for stuff online of course
01-02-2019T17:41:31,sunblaze,just a matter of perception
01-02-2019T17:41:42,Bgrmystr2,I'm not really including physical stuff
01-02-2019T17:43:52,CatzArt,Oh boy thats a lot. Odd question but has anyone seen the anime Princess and the pilot or the pilots love song? both are bye the same guy.
01-02-2019T17:44:06,sunblaze,probably sage .D
01-02-2019T17:46:24,Xexanoth,"ongoing webcomics are a real problem though, currently back at 40 after several purges over the years...."
01-02-2019T17:47:02,sunblaze,oh I like ongoing.
01-02-2019T17:47:05,Xexanoth,at least mangas usually end after a while(unless it's something like One Piece XD)
01-02-2019T17:47:16,sunblaze,better then hiatus and forgotten a good story. happens way to often
01-02-2019T17:47:50,Xexanoth,i prefer finished
01-02-2019T17:47:57,CatzArt,Oh boy what song is this? that was quite the opening
01-02-2019T17:48:42,SageSaga,the one playing now or the one before it?
01-02-2019T17:48:47,Xexanoth,ongoing just gets annoying when you have to much stuff that's ongoing. especially when it's stuff like book series where you always gotta wait for the next book
01-02-2019T17:48:48,CatzArt,the one now
01-02-2019T17:49:07,SageSaga,WagakkiBand - Kishikaisei

01-02-2019T18:09:56,SageSaga,im kinda sad i dont have that happen- because shes keeping the gauntlet XD
01-02-2019T18:10:20,CatzArt,"ah well now he can get a magical prosthetic. WIth all sorts of attachments, like a can opener!"
01-02-2019T18:10:39,sunblaze,yesss glorious gauntlet loot!
01-02-2019T18:11:21,CatzArt,But I doubt he will live that long. See you in Valhalla mystery assassin!

01-02-2019T18:15:19,Bgrmystr2,I am fairly sure he did not need to give her the upper hand in this battle.
01-02-2019T18:15:44,Bgrmystr2,But she'll obviously take it. :v
01-02-2019T18:16:44,SageSaga,i kinda wanted her to take him on unarmed but i needed to explain her weapon
01-02-2019T18:16:59,SageSaga,later folks!

01-02-2019T18:26:09,KiTA,"Nah, I mean, a twokinds notification haha"
01-02-2019T18:26:21,Bgrmystr2,for a new comic page
01-02-2019T18:39:55,TheGamePlayer,I'm back
01-02-2019T18:40:24,SageSaga,im getting sick of these people thinking Android is a male only term and saying im wrong to call my android characters androids
01-02-2019T18:41:25,TheGamePlayer,If there Android's there androids?
01-02-2019T18:41:48,TheGamePlayer,They can deal with that lol
01-02-2019T18:42:07,SageSaga,"they keep saying ""ACTUALLY androids are male, Gynoids are female! So they are Gynoids!"""
01-02-2019T18:42:21,TheGamePlayer,Ah
01-02-2019T18:42:23,SageSaga,"and im like ""How dare you speak to me"""
01-02-2019T18:42:42,TheGamePlayer,XD
01-02-2019T18:43:14,TheGamePlayer,"I just got back from getting my new puppy, he is so adorable"
01-02-2019T18:43:18,Bgrmystr2,isn't it true though?
01-02-2019T18:43:46,Bgrmystr2,"I don't really care honestly, but based on what I read a while back, it seems legit"
01-02-2019T18:43:52,SageSaga,"oh and that while the roots of the term android are based in greek for Male and a form of - it was made to mean ""In the form of man"" or ""Humanoid"""
01-02-2019T18:43:59,SageSaga,its not
01-02-2019T18:44:07,SageSaga,android means humanoid robot
01-02-2019T18:44:15,SageSaga,it is not gender specific and never was
01-02-2019T18:44:16,TheGamePlayer,Ya
01-02-2019T18:44:32,BadFoMo,That's what I always thought it ment.
01-02-2019T18:44:38,SageSaga,gynoid was created later mostly for use with sexbots
01-02-2019T18:44:45,SageSaga,and im not calling my characters sex bots
01-02-2019T18:44:51,TheGamePlayer,In Detroit become human they refer to all Androids as androids
01-02-2019T18:44:51,Bgrmystr2,lool
01-02-2019T18:45:02,TheGamePlayer,XD
01-02-2019T18:45:20,Bgrmystr2,"well that's because most people aren't even aware there's more than one term, Gameplayer"
01-02-2019T18:45:30,TheGamePlayer,Eh
01-02-2019T18:45:30,Bgrmystr2,so calling them something else would just generate confusion
01-02-2019T18:45:34,BadFoMo,I've never heard of the term 'Gynoids' until now.
01-02-2019T18:45:40,TheGamePlayer,Same
01-02-2019T18:45:45,Sammit,There is also Android 18 from DBZ
01-02-2019T18:45:47,Bgrmystr2,I've heard it before.
01-02-2019T18:46:26,TheGamePlayer,I'ma be in and out playing Battlefield V
01-02-2019T18:46:42,RimaDraws,oh stream is over
01-02-2019T18:46:50,TheGamePlayer,I knoe
01-02-2019T18:46:56,TheGamePlayer,Know
01-02-2019T18:47:13,RimaDraws,i just got back from getting foods
01-02-2019T18:47:28,Bgrmystr2,Stream ended a half hour ago
01-02-2019T18:47:28,TheGamePlayer,Ah cool
01-02-2019T18:47:35,SageSaga,thing is if you are going to try and correct me- maybe do some research first- because from the wikipedia page it says
01-02-2019T18:47:38,SageSaga,"While the term ""android"" is used in reference to human-looking robots in general, a robot with a female appearance can also be referred to as a ""gynoid""."
01-02-2019T18:48:11,RimaDraws,o.o''
01-02-2019T18:48:17,TheGamePlayer,So both
01-02-2019T18:48:21,SageSaga,"""Hey this term is non gender specific but if you want to you can use the gender specific term!"""
01-02-2019T18:48:46,Bgrmystr2,I
01-02-2019T18:48:59,Bgrmystr2,"yup, apostrophe thinks it's the enter button"
01-02-2019T18:49:00,SageSaga,"so calling them androids isnt wrong- besides i wanna just say ""Do you know for sure they are all gynoids? What if they all secretly have DICKS?!"""
01-02-2019T18:49:14,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock:
01-02-2019T18:49:15,RimaDraws,lol
01-02-2019T18:49:19,Bgrmystr2,"I mean technically, they could."
01-02-2019T18:49:22,TheGamePlayer,XD
01-02-2019T18:49:26,Bgrmystr2,so.. legit?
01-02-2019T18:49:32,RimaDraws,sage you are something else lol
01-02-2019T18:49:43,Bgrmystr2,"no, I think that reaction of his is fairly normal"
01-02-2019T18:49:51,SageSaga,"or they might not have a sex at all- then what do i call them? OH YEAH! ANDROIDS!"""
01-02-2019T18:49:53,RimaDraws,i know i just find it amusing
01-02-2019T18:50:18,TheGamePlayer,Lol
01-02-2019T18:50:25,TheGamePlayer,Brb
01-02-2019T18:50:43,SageSaga,i have to deal with this way too much =_= some idiot finds out that the term Gynoid is a thing and they have to try and correct me
01-02-2019T18:51:00,RimaDraws,huh.
01-02-2019T18:51:02,TheGamePlayer,Lol
01-02-2019T18:51:04,SageSaga,besides- Gynoid is a stupid term
01-02-2019T18:51:14,TheGamePlayer,Ya
01-02-2019T18:51:32,SageSaga,did Google call their phone OS Gynoid? No! Why? Because it's dumb
01-02-2019T18:51:33,BadFoMo,"Wait, how old is that term?"
01-02-2019T18:51:34,RimaDraws,i have never heard of that term before
01-02-2019T18:52:00,Bgrmystr2,"well noone corrected you here, and I highly doubt we truly understand the definition of something that happened such a long time ago"
01-02-2019T18:52:34,SageSaga,it wasnt that long ago- it wasnt made back in ancient Greek
01-02-2019T18:52:52,SageSaga,the writer who used it just thought it sounded cool and shorter than Humanoid Robot
01-02-2019T18:53:07,RimaDraws,humanoid sounds cooler
01-02-2019T18:53:43,Xexanoth,"Just call em ""Human Replacement"""
01-02-2019T18:53:49,Xexanoth,"or ""Human but better"""
01-02-2019T18:53:55,RimaDraws,lol
01-02-2019T18:53:56,RimaDraws,no
01-02-2019T18:54:06,TheGamePlayer,Deviants
01-02-2019T18:54:54,SageSaga,they are Androids =_=
01-02-2019T18:55:01,Bgrmystr2,"""not that long ago"", it says it took place round 2000 years ago :thinking:"
01-02-2019T18:55:03,TheGamePlayer,I know
01-02-2019T18:55:20,Bgrmystr2,between 1600 and 2900 years ago?
01-02-2019T18:55:24,Bgrmystr2,that's quite a while
01-02-2019T18:55:38,SageSaga,dude- 1728 isnt that long ago
01-02-2019T18:55:45,Bgrmystr2,BCE
01-02-2019T18:55:46,RimaDraws,noooo
01-02-2019T18:55:54,TheGamePlayer,Ya only around 300 years ago
01-02-2019T18:56:05,SageSaga,oh wait sorry -1886
01-02-2019T18:56:12,ThingsAreMoving,o/
01-02-2019T18:56:16,RimaDraws,things!
01-02-2019T18:56:24,ThingsAreMoving,Rima!
01-02-2019T18:56:25,SageSaga,1886 is when it was actually used for humanoid robot
01-02-2019T18:56:25,TheGamePlayer,Hi Things!!!
01-02-2019T18:56:26,Bgrmystr2,ancient Greece is 9th century BCE to the 6th century CE
01-02-2019T18:56:32,Bgrmystr2,So...
01-02-2019T18:56:33,RimaDraws,hows you?
01-02-2019T18:56:54,ThingsAreMoving,"Pretty good. Are we talking about robots, cyborgs and androids?"
01-02-2019T18:57:03,SageSaga,it was based on GREEK LANGUAGE - not created by the ancient Greeks
01-02-2019T18:57:11,RimaDraws,lol
01-02-2019T18:57:13,RimaDraws,yes
01-02-2019T18:57:42,Bgrmystr2,"Yeah we talkin about beepboops, Things :robot:"
01-02-2019T18:58:49,ThingsAreMoving,"Male shaped robot - android, female shaped robot - gynoid, can't tell wtf it's supposed to be - droid"
01-02-2019T18:59:00,Bgrmystr2,Roger Roger
01-02-2019T18:59:20,SageSaga,wrong - Android is not male or female
01-02-2019T18:59:24,RimaDraws,^
01-02-2019T18:59:29,SageSaga,its just humanoid robot
01-02-2019T18:59:40,ThingsAreMoving,[citation needed]
01-02-2019T18:59:47,Bgrmystr2,xD
01-02-2019T19:00:00,SageSaga,"While the term ""android"" is used in reference to human-looking robots in general, a robot with a female appearance can also be referred to as a ""gynoid""."
01-02-2019T19:00:04,SageSaga,there ya go
01-02-2019T19:00:05,RimaDraws,*gives a $500 fine to things*
01-02-2019T19:00:14,Bgrmystr2,"unenforcable, Rima."
01-02-2019T19:00:29,ThingsAreMoving,"It seems logical, Sage."
01-02-2019T19:00:36,RimaDraws,i dont know how you want me to do it unless you are the expert bgr
01-02-2019T19:00:43,Bgrmystr2,"You may have to speak to fluff, sage, cuz he's really been on the gynoid train."
01-02-2019T19:01:38,SageSaga,im saying its fine to call something a gynoid if you want- but its not ok to correct someone when they arent wrong calling it something else
01-02-2019T19:02:02,ThingsAreMoving,"So, gynoids can be called androids, but androids can't be called gynoids in some cases"
01-02-2019T19:02:10,RimaDraws,i think so
01-02-2019T19:02:10,SageSaga,right
01-02-2019T19:02:22,ThingsAreMoving,like squares and rectangles type of thing
01-02-2019T19:02:29,Bgrmystr2,"Personally, I highly doubt we know enough of intention anyway, as they probably never intended it to be though of in this way in the first place."
01-02-2019T19:02:42,SageSaga,"like technically we call women Man because we consider ""Man"" to refer to all humans"
01-02-2019T19:02:51,Xexanoth,"i'm just gonna go with ""Robot"" to piss everyone off :ptv-snicker:"
01-02-2019T19:03:01,RimaDraws,xexa no lol
01-02-2019T19:03:04,ThingsAreMoving,Electronic life form
01-02-2019T19:03:07,BadFoMo,I was just about to say that.
01-02-2019T19:03:14,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-angry: aaaaaAa etc :ptv-laugh:
01-02-2019T19:03:29,SageSaga,im also like- hey- its my freakn comic.
01-02-2019T19:03:39,RimaDraws,yea and no one can tell you otherwise
01-02-2019T19:04:02,Xexanoth,"which is funny cause androids are robots, but so many sci fi fans get their panties twisted when you call an android robot"
01-02-2019T19:04:19,SageSaga,You can tell me i spelled suppose wrong- i do it all the time- but dont tell me that calling humanoid robots androids is wrong because theres another term that is similar
01-02-2019T19:05:55,Bgrmystr2,"Most of the time they're correct, xex, because generally you see people refer androids as biomechanical"
01-02-2019T19:06:02,Bgrmystr2,they're not 100% artificial
01-02-2019T19:06:07,ThingsAreMoving,"biomechanical beings are cyborgs, Bgr"
01-02-2019T19:06:14,Bgrmystr2,ah is it cyborgs?
01-02-2019T19:06:21,ThingsAreMoving,yep
01-02-2019T19:06:35,ThingsAreMoving,"if you have a pacer installed, or a hearing aid you are a cyborg"
01-02-2019T19:06:39,Bgrmystr2,aaa
01-02-2019T19:06:44,Bgrmystr2,"you right, nvm"
01-02-2019T19:06:58,Bgrmystr2,I keep forgetting
01-02-2019T19:07:31,Bgrmystr2,"though I guess japan has ruined me, they tend to call cyborgs as androids all the time"
01-02-2019T19:07:54,Bgrmystr2,18.. for one.
01-02-2019T19:07:59,SageSaga,technically i am a cyborg
01-02-2019T19:08:09,BadFoMo,What?!
01-02-2019T19:08:14,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock: I will not take you to our leader!
01-02-2019T19:08:15,ThingsAreMoving,Can you shoot lazors out of your eyes?
01-02-2019T19:08:26,Bgrmystr2,You wouldn't want to meet him anyway
01-02-2019T19:09:01,SageSaga,the original requirements to be a cyborg was to be a human that is enhanced by technology
01-02-2019T19:09:12,SageSaga,i wear glasses- thus i am enhanced by technology
01-02-2019T19:09:19,Bgrmystr2,..no xD
01-02-2019T19:09:23,SageSaga,yep
01-02-2019T19:09:28,BadFoMo,Oh...
01-02-2019T19:09:29,Bgrmystr2,"cuz that's external, not internal."
01-02-2019T19:09:33,Bgrmystr2,that's not the same
01-02-2019T19:09:42,SageSaga,by definition it is
01-02-2019T19:10:11,Bgrmystr2,By definition I disagree xD
01-02-2019T19:10:16,SageSaga,now if you want to argue is that definition still valid you might have a case- but it was and is still a valid definition
01-02-2019T19:10:29,BadFoMo,There's only one way to settel this... To the Internet!
01-02-2019T19:10:38,Bgrmystr2,"because the internet NEVER lies, Fomo"
01-02-2019T19:10:49,Bgrmystr2,or has misleading or disleading information lol
01-02-2019T19:11:06,SageSaga,this comes from Adam Savages series on living forever btw
01-02-2019T19:11:13,BadFoMo,"(I know, that's why I said it like that.)"
01-02-2019T19:11:57,SageSaga,he runs down the methods of keeping ones body alive and the complications that arise and theoretical fixes for them
01-02-2019T19:14:08,SageSaga,anywho - y'all take care- i gotta fix some dinner before game time
01-02-2019T19:14:23,ThingsAreMoving,o/ Good luck wit your cooking
01-02-2019T19:14:29,BadFoMo,Bye.
01-02-2019T19:14:39,BadFoMo,"@Bgrmystr2 A little late, but I'm reminded of this. https://youtu.be/yJD1Iwy5lUY?t=45"
01-02-2019T19:14:42,SageSaga,"dont message Tom saying he's using the wrong word for Keidran and they should really be ""Anthroids"""
01-02-2019T19:16:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Anthroids sounds like animal androids
01-02-2019T19:16:57,SpazztasticKiwi,humanoid animal androids
01-02-2019T19:17:41,ThingsAreMoving,Anthroids sounds like some sort of illness
01-02-2019T19:19:37,Bgrmystr2,Anthroid requires them to be androids though
01-02-2019T19:19:44,Bgrmystr2,in which case NONE of them are.
01-02-2019T19:19:48,RimaDraws,anthroids ?? lol wut
01-02-2019T19:19:57,Bgrmystr2,anthropomorphic android.
01-02-2019T19:20:02,Xexanoth,pretty sure Anthroids are Fluffs thing
01-02-2019T19:20:06,RimaDraws,i know what it is bgr
01-02-2019T19:20:15,RimaDraws,i just think thats a dumb term
01-02-2019T19:20:22,Bgrmystr2,"I don't, cuz it actually makes sense."
01-02-2019T19:20:29,Bgrmystr2,nothin dumb about it.
01-02-2019T19:20:32,BadFoMo,"Doctor: I'm sorry, but you have Anthroids. I sugguest you start getting pants with an opening in the back for a tail."
01-02-2019T19:20:44,Xexanoth,isn't andro just a different spelling of anthro
01-02-2019T19:21:00,BadFoMo,...I think it is.
01-02-2019T19:21:12,Xexanoth,"cause android means ""human like robot"" and anthro means ""human like"""
01-02-2019T19:21:58,ThingsAreMoving,Anthro homo androids
01-02-2019T19:22:02,ThingsAreMoving,the horror
01-02-2019T19:22:19,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, on a technicality, sure, but anthro is used as a shortened version of anthropomorphic, meaning human-like animal"
01-02-2019T19:22:57,Bgrmystr2,"Or other, non-human things, mostly animals though"
01-02-2019T19:23:00,Xexanoth,pretty sure anthromorphic only means human shaped
01-02-2019T19:23:05,Xexanoth,morph=shape
01-02-2019T19:23:20,Xexanoth,*+po
01-02-2019T19:23:26,ThingsAreMoving,anthropomorfic doesn't necessarily imply animal
01-02-2019T19:23:35,ThingsAreMoving,"yeax, agree w. Xex on that"
01-02-2019T19:23:52,Bgrmystr2,"Of course it doesn't, that's how it's used though."
01-02-2019T19:24:29,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, you can try and reshape the ENTIRE furry community to not use ""anthro"" as a term for anthropomorphic animals"
01-02-2019T19:24:32,Xexanoth,that might just be because we're furries and that's the main use for us though.....
01-02-2019T19:24:33,Bgrmystr2,go right ahead xDD
01-02-2019T19:24:53,Xexanoth,"but for the world at large anthro simply means something with humans, like anthropology....."
01-02-2019T19:27:35,Bgrmystr2,"and in the furry community, anthroid easily means anthropomorphic animal android"
01-02-2019T19:28:33,Bgrmystr2,"There is a line of logic, though the foreshortening makes the term unclear to those not in-the-know"
01-02-2019T19:29:41,Mippy,Yay! Water is back on!
01-02-2019T19:29:59,Mippy,And Maddie is older than I thought!
01-02-2019T19:30:16,Bgrmystr2,I'm honestly not surprised by her age
01-02-2019T19:31:03,Mippy,I thought she was a little older then she said...but I was thinking 15ish
01-02-2019T19:31:10,Xexanoth,"yeah, it's pretty much what people discussed on here"
01-02-2019T19:31:45,Mippy,I missed the convo :ctwokinds-reniderp_flip:
01-02-2019T19:31:49,Bgrmystr2,It was pretty obvious she was not nearly as young as 13 lol
01-02-2019T19:31:58,Xexanoth,the convo happened multiple times ^^
01-02-2019T19:32:02,Xexanoth,usually during streams
01-02-2019T19:32:42,Mippy,Chat messes up for me during streams and I don’t always care to have my phone open.
01-02-2019T19:32:59,Mippy,I should change that
01-02-2019T19:33:12,Xexanoth,"funnily enough, she wasn't even the only character from a series that i'm currently reading where all the people are like:""She's older than people act like"""
01-02-2019T19:33:30,Xexanoth,"though in the other one it's a human in a castle fulll of demons, though it's not like they could tell..."
01-02-2019T19:33:52,Bgrmystr2,"that's strange to me, Mippy, maybe your phone is buggy"
01-02-2019T19:34:05,Bgrmystr2,cuz chat is stable for the most part
01-02-2019T19:34:15,Bgrmystr2,there's way more problems with the streams than with the chat.
01-02-2019T19:34:26,Mippy,it’s my computer that it messes up. Not my phone
01-02-2019T19:34:45,Bgrmystr2,"Then your computer is buggy. Either way, it seems like a problem"
01-02-2019T19:35:11,Bgrmystr2,"the site has some issues, but they're not constant and it's not a major issue"
01-02-2019T19:35:19,Mippy,Probably.
01-02-2019T19:35:35,Bgrmystr2,just minor disconnections and reconnections every maybe.. couple of days.
01-02-2019T19:35:54,Bgrmystr2,"the streams usually do multiple reconnections within a few hours, but it makes sense due to the bandwith needed"
01-02-2019T19:35:59,Mippy,Computer is a couple years old and I’ve dropped it beforehand
01-02-2019T19:36:36,Bgrmystr2,"if it's not running an SSD, I'd recommend getting CrystalDiskInfo so you can tell if your hard drive in it is failing"
01-02-2019T19:37:05,Bgrmystr2,though it's good to have either way
01-02-2019T19:37:25,Mippy,:ctwokinds-floraquestion: I don’t know much about it. I’d have to look it up.
01-02-2019T19:38:24,Mippy,Thanks for the tip.
01-02-2019T19:38:37,Bgrmystr2,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/250139544517607424/541417139605602334/DiskInfoS_2019-02-02_18-38-50.png this is what it looks like
01-02-2019T19:38:50,Bgrmystr2,at least mine
01-02-2019T19:38:59,Bgrmystr2,there's a couple versions out there
01-02-2019T19:39:15,Mippy,Oh my gosh! It’s cute :ptv-ohmy:
01-02-2019T19:39:40,Bgrmystr2,right?
01-02-2019T19:39:51,Mippy,I’ll definitely see what I can do when I get home later. Seems useful.
01-02-2019T19:41:24,Mippy,"Well, gotta go before management gets on my butt"
01-02-2019T19:41:34,Bgrmystr2,godspeed :ptv-greetings:
01-02-2019T21:12:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh yeah
01-02-2019T21:13:00,SpazztasticKiwi,I got work tomorrow
01-02-2019T21:13:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Sunday
01-02-2019T21:13:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Ew
01-02-2019T21:14:50,Bgrmystr2,Rip watching the stream
01-02-2019T21:15:50,RimaDraws,;;
01-02-2019T21:18:08,SpazztasticKiwi,As I said the other day - schedule feyucked. No one to fix it
01-02-2019T21:18:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m supposed to be off Sundays
01-02-2019T21:29:40,RimaDraws,thats a double ouch
01-02-2019T21:58:23,SpazztasticKiwi,But hey I made a lil alien boi today
01-02-2019T22:04:51,ThingsAreMoving,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
01-02-2019T22:25:56,RimaDraws,things sleepy?
01-02-2019T22:37:20,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-katdryer:
01-02-2019T22:40:03,Bgrmystr2,it feels so late
01-02-2019T22:40:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Only one explanation
01-02-2019T22:40:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Aliens
01-02-2019T22:40:57,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
01-02-2019T22:41:37,SpazztasticKiwi,See. I saw one today https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/524825976597643265/541452176950689802/image0.jpg
01-02-2019T22:42:58,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-confused: um
01-02-2019T22:43:06,Bgrmystr2,I don't even know what that's supposed to be
01-02-2019T22:50:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Bunch of lines is all
01-02-2019T22:51:09,SpazztasticKiwi,"But anyhoo, you looked at the snowy Subnautica yet"
01-02-2019T22:51:22,SpazztasticKiwi,They made new beasties
01-02-2019T22:54:18,Bgrmystr2,"nope, I don't follow Subnautica."
01-02-2019T22:54:25,Bgrmystr2,Watched Jack play it and that was about it.
01-02-2019T22:55:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Lots are still in the works obviously but I want to bet the mystery containment has a snow reaper
01-02-2019T22:56:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Or there’s gonna be a snow reaper somewhere in the game - I know there’s apparently a worm monster thing
01-02-2019T22:56:56,SpazztasticKiwi,But I’m gonna go on for a bit
01-02-2019T23:04:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Just everyone ignore the link
01-02-2019T23:05:11,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-maddiessparkles: no
01-02-2019T23:09:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Yes
01-02-2019T23:09:57,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s just a bunch of lines
01-02-2019T23:10:07,Bgrmystr2,but he has to save zelda from the chickens
01-02-2019T23:10:25,SpazztasticKiwi,You just said it didn’t look like anything
01-02-2019T23:10:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Ergo. Just nm it
01-02-2019T23:10:41,Bgrmystr2,":thinking: ..well I guess if we ignore him, he can go about his business easier... and link isn't much to look at."
01-02-2019T23:11:07,Bgrmystr2,so I guess he can save zelda faster that way.
01-02-2019T23:11:10,Ordithus,"I dunno, he's pretty bright.  Hard to miss while he breaks into my house while I'm just sitting here"
01-02-2019T23:11:15,Ordithus,And smashes all my things
01-02-2019T23:11:25,Bgrmystr2,just don't have vases and urns and stuff.
01-02-2019T23:11:33,Bgrmystr2,or put them on the top shelf where he can't reach
01-02-2019T23:11:35,Bgrmystr2,:V
01-02-2019T23:12:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m just going to bed
01-02-2019T23:12:24,Ordithus,Night Kiwi
01-02-2019T23:12:29,Bgrmystr2,take it easy kiwi

01-02-2019T23:39:01,RimaDraws,yea that was a pain
