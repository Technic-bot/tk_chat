01-06-2019T15:49:56,AspiringNoodle,"Also, let's just say that Adobe's done a good job with their marketing xD"

01-06-2019T15:53:53,AspiringNoodle,I'm just not a fan of Photoshop's new pricing model :/
01-06-2019T15:54:01,WereKeidran,time for Smash
01-06-2019T15:54:11,AspiringNoodle,"The idea that you have to constantly pay to access the software, when all it's funding is new gimmicky features and even more bugs."
01-06-2019T15:54:26,increaz,you pay ... you get program model?
01-06-2019T15:54:30,AspiringNoodle,"Well, with the exception of the symmetry tool :P"
01-06-2019T15:54:50,WereKeidran,"i do photography and nwould have paid for lightroom, but yeah, i'm not very subscription minded"
01-06-2019T15:55:06,increaz,havent used it in a couple years
01-06-2019T15:55:08,AFallingTree,"right i brb, just grabbin brecky"
01-06-2019T15:55:13,IronHorseComics,"I had to for college, but I kept it because it's been very handy for me"
01-06-2019T15:55:14,Ordithus,Nora is turning into a cutie here
01-06-2019T15:55:17,IronHorseComics,and I use it a lot
01-06-2019T15:55:21,Bgrmystr2,"you pay for the software over and over and over and cuz it's a subscription, you'll NEVER own it. It's literally a ripoff."
01-06-2019T15:55:21,Avolendi,She looks ominously happy xD
01-06-2019T15:55:23,MisterWho,today you pay cloud - only sadly... :(
01-06-2019T15:55:24,WereKeidran,Nora was always a cutie
01-06-2019T15:55:25,Bgrmystr2,big pass.
01-06-2019T15:55:36,AspiringNoodle,I think most people are smart enough to realize that Adobe switched to the subscription model because they just can't innovate the product at the same rate anymore.
01-06-2019T15:55:45,increaz,happy nora is good nora
01-06-2019T15:55:54,Bgrmystr2,"that will only make them lose more users, noodle"
01-06-2019T15:55:56,AspiringNoodle,"And if they can't add new features that can entice you to purchase / upgrade, then they're losing money"
01-06-2019T15:56:06,AspiringNoodle,They went full cloud in 2013
01-06-2019T15:56:07,Bgrmystr2,they've only shot themselves in the foot lol
01-06-2019T15:56:33,AspiringNoodle,"Personally, I'd love it if they gave you a half-and-half option"
01-06-2019T15:57:16,AspiringNoodle,"Subscribe to the program for X months, and when your subscription ends, you can keep whatever version (or the latest version at the time)"
01-06-2019T15:57:28,AspiringNoodle,"But nope, because Adobe"
01-06-2019T15:57:32,Aphala,I do miss just buying ONE part of the adobe suite
01-06-2019T15:57:39,qwe304,it should have her tripping since canonically nora hates walking with two legs and isnt very good at it
01-06-2019T15:58:05,unsteddyphoenix,two digi legs even harder

01-06-2019T15:59:13,AspiringNoodle,I just imagine the outcome of this scenario being the fololows
01-06-2019T15:59:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,and just picture how the bones in your legs are looking like

01-06-2019T20:12:13,CrRAR,:rocket:
01-06-2019T20:12:14,w0lfmare,Nora finds other dragons to be boring
01-06-2019T20:12:28,TraceLegacyXI,That has been established
01-06-2019T20:12:35,McClaw,"Aw, she didn't slip under the covers. Or remove his PJs. ;)"
01-06-2019T20:12:43,Ordithus,*yet*
01-06-2019T20:12:44,TraceLegacyXI,She is very much into me Trace
01-06-2019T20:12:52,CrRAR,yes YOU
01-06-2019T20:13:04,TraceLegacyXI,Mister not me
01-06-2019T20:13:10,TraceLegacyXI,That’s what I meant
01-06-2019T20:13:15,TraceLegacyXI,Sorry
01-06-2019T20:13:18,CrRAR,ah
01-06-2019T20:13:30,frmCast351,magic creatures like dragons are probably attracted to powerful sources of magic
01-06-2019T20:13:35,Mippy,Who is Mister?
01-06-2019T20:13:44,CrRAR,"""Mr Trace"""
01-06-2019T20:13:45,TraceLegacyXI,And Trace is certainly a powerful mana source
01-06-2019T20:13:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Think Nora would short circuit if “it’s raining men” became a thing
01-06-2019T20:13:58,TraceLegacyXI,Probably
01-06-2019T20:14:04,Mippy,My hedghog has not been meeting with Nora
01-06-2019T20:14:10,TraceLegacyXI,And I would laugh if that ever hapepned
01-06-2019T20:14:14,frmCast351,"nora is pretty powerful as far as dragons go, and trace very powerful by human standard"
01-06-2019T20:14:30,TraceLegacyXI,I agree with cast
01-06-2019T20:14:40,frmCast351,"other dragons wouldn't be too interesting to nora, because most aren't as powerful as her"
01-06-2019T20:14:41,McClaw,"If Nora is attracted to powerful mana sources, what if that source is female?"
01-06-2019T20:14:42,TraceLegacyXI,Not choosing sides or anything
01-06-2019T20:14:48,FenceEqualizer,See Nora still hasn't hydrated yet. Her thirst is strong. 🍹
01-06-2019T20:14:52,TraceLegacyXI,...
01-06-2019T20:14:56,Ordithus,She does like Raine as of this stream~
01-06-2019T20:15:05,TraceLegacyXI,Good question claw. I don’t mnow
01-06-2019T20:15:09,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-RaineEep::sweat_drops:

01-06-2019T20:15:39,TraceLegacyXI,That was a lot of hashtags there
01-06-2019T20:15:51,Mippy,Obviously an 1000 year old dragon dose not care about that sex of the p mana source
01-06-2019T20:16:13,TraceLegacyXI,Yep
01-06-2019T20:16:20,TraceLegacyXI,Makes sense
01-06-2019T20:16:26,BadFoMo,@Mippy ...Wat?
01-06-2019T20:16:34,frmCast351,"i feel it's prob safe to assume nora is interested in trace because he's powerful by her standard, and because he used to be a commanding, dominant figure"
01-06-2019T20:16:34,TraceLegacyXI,Oh hey bad
01-06-2019T20:16:37,Ordithus,This sketch went from aww to hawt in a flash
01-06-2019T20:16:39,BadFoMo,Yo.
01-06-2019T20:16:55,Mippy,Keep  up Bad
01-06-2019T20:16:55,TraceLegacyXI,Yes. Yes it did
01-06-2019T20:17:01,FenceEqualizer,The fact that Trace is not fazed by this means she's tried this several times.
01-06-2019T20:17:07,CrRAR,"It's not the motion of the ocean, but the passion you be stashin'."
01-06-2019T20:17:11,CrRAR,...or something.

01-06-2019T20:17:27,TraceLegacyXI,Just wow

01-06-2019T20:30:00,IronHorseComics,it would turn her into a fox
01-06-2019T20:30:04,ElvenHunter84,She rubs his ears?
01-06-2019T20:30:05,MuonNeutrino,i dunno? it makes more sense than eric wearing it
01-06-2019T20:30:10,TraceLegacyXI,So please elaborate on how that works
01-06-2019T20:30:10,KiTA,Maybe it's human Kat trying to seduce Fox Eric
01-06-2019T20:30:12,Ordithus,Maybe?
01-06-2019T20:30:22,IronHorseComics,it's magic
01-06-2019T20:30:27,TraceLegacyXI,"Well, kita could be right"
01-06-2019T20:30:34,vevans0009,How?
01-06-2019T20:30:36,MuonNeutrino,"i.e. she sees he's not interested in her but is in other keidran, so she tries to turn into another type of keidran? idunno"
01-06-2019T20:30:40,vevans0009,Its all up in the air
01-06-2019T20:30:46,KiTA,Who made the suggestion?
01-06-2019T20:30:50,MuonNeutrino,would the collars even work on someone who's already a keidran? XD
01-06-2019T20:30:52,KiTA,Are they around to ask?  lol
01-06-2019T20:30:52,RandomTonio,Hello
01-06-2019T20:30:53,TraceLegacyXI,Maybe neutrino. Maybe
01-06-2019T20:31:00,RandomTonio,Who is winning?
01-06-2019T20:31:06,Ordithus,It worked on Natani and Flora
01-06-2019T20:31:08,TraceLegacyXI,Idk XD
01-06-2019T20:31:10,MviluUatusun,"Well, it's time for me to head off to bed.  I'll see y'all next time."
01-06-2019T20:31:10,FenceEqualizer,I bet Eric would still recognize Kat.
01-06-2019T20:31:15,Ordithus,Night Mvilu
01-06-2019T20:31:21,RandomTonio,What is happening?
01-06-2019T20:31:22,TraceLegacyXI,Your probably right fence
01-06-2019T20:31:31,FenceEqualizer,Night Mvilu
01-06-2019T20:31:39,TraceLegacyXI,Night mvilu
01-06-2019T20:31:49,Ordithus,Though Fox Eric had a nice booty
01-06-2019T20:31:54,Twokinds,What were you wanting when you voted for this? XD
01-06-2019T20:32:08,TraceLegacyXI,Why is this the topic of this conversation?
01-06-2019T20:32:24,FloofyCat,I can't remember what the full suggestion was
01-06-2019T20:32:33,TraceLegacyXI,SOMEONE EXPLAIN TO MW PLEASE!!
01-06-2019T20:32:41,InTheLionsDen,"Tired of waiting for Eric to show his affection, Kat decides to use ""Basitin Wooing"" techniques on him (and maybe a Fox collar)."
01-06-2019T20:32:41,TraceLegacyXI,*ME
01-06-2019T20:32:49,KiTA,OK
01-06-2019T20:32:55,KiTA,that makes more sense.
01-06-2019T20:32:56,MuonNeutrino,"the question, of course, being what that suggestion actually means heh"
01-06-2019T20:33:02,Ordithus,I forget what Basitin wooing even was
01-06-2019T20:33:04,TraceLegacyXI,Heh
01-06-2019T20:33:08,KiTA,I could see Kat just turning Eric into a Foxboy and trying to seduce him that way
01-06-2019T20:33:10,TraceLegacyXI,Same
01-06-2019T20:33:11,FenceEqualizer,So Kat tries to seduce Eric like a Basitin would?
01-06-2019T20:33:23,TraceLegacyXI,Idk how that would work
01-06-2019T20:33:24,KiTA,Bastian Wooing is beating the snot out of each other isn't it?
01-06-2019T20:33:28,CrRAR,*platonic sparring*
01-06-2019T20:33:30,TraceLegacyXI,:/
01-06-2019T20:33:34,KiTA,No wait that's Klingon
01-06-2019T20:33:37,FloofyCat,I thought it was using a fox collar on Eric and using basitin wooing as in Keith's wooing of Laura
01-06-2019T20:33:54,FloofyCat,But either is good its kinda ambiguous
01-06-2019T20:33:57,TraceLegacyXI,I think ima get off now
01-06-2019T20:33:58,FenceEqualizer,I love you! *Throws out a hay maker*
01-06-2019T20:33:59,vevans0009,Never seen so much confusion over a suggestion.
01-06-2019T20:34:04,KiTA,Only thing I remember about Kei tha nd Laura's wooin' is Laura in dominatrix outfits domming Keith
01-06-2019T20:34:05,TraceLegacyXI,I got graduation tomorrow
01-06-2019T20:34:10,CrRAR,yay
01-06-2019T20:34:12,TraceLegacyXI,Gnight y’all
01-06-2019T20:34:16,KiTA,So maybe Eric as a foxboy with Kat as a domme?

01-06-2019T22:23:09,AspiringNoodle,"Most of the time it's computer hardware or art stuff.  And what do I get for the next 2 - 3 weeks?  Ads for the exact same products I was looking at, not even different manufacturers / brands."
01-06-2019T22:23:28,AspiringNoodle,"It's like, ""Yes, thank you, I already looked at this stuff."""
