25-04-2019T00:02:55,CrimsonQuill,Morning
25-04-2019T00:09:26,CrimsonQuill,Anyone here?
25-04-2019T00:25:36,SonOfGoku,Hi
25-04-2019T00:25:42,CrimsonQuill,hullo
25-04-2019T00:27:17,SonOfGoku,How’s the Xbox live?
25-04-2019T00:27:37,CrimsonQuill,slow matchmaking
25-04-2019T00:27:43,CrimsonQuill,And may have to be sparing
25-04-2019T00:28:08,CrimsonQuill,"Because of need to study for Maths, GNSS, Photogrammetry, Geodetic and Mine surveying..."
25-04-2019T00:28:15,CrimsonQuill,I hate exams.
25-04-2019T00:28:40,SonOfGoku,I know how you feel
25-04-2019T00:29:44,CrimsonQuill,"Oh, and caught up to current comics. Now terrified for my favourite characters."
25-04-2019T00:33:02,CrimsonQuill,"Well, got to go"
25-04-2019T00:33:08,CrimsonQuill,Have to let some animals out
25-04-2019T01:13:38,SpazztasticKiwi,"Though if you wanna call my 5 in a row weak, what do you call the fact that you’ve yet to even start"
25-04-2019T01:13:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Seems I’m ahead
25-04-2019T01:14:12,Bgrmystr2,"lol, not that specific anime, just 5 hours in general"
25-04-2019T01:14:56,Bgrmystr2,"when I watch it, I'll probably binge it from when I wake up to when I go to sleep, only getting up for food or bathroom. Usually how it goes if I'm free all day and want to watch anime"
25-04-2019T01:15:25,Bgrmystr2,so.. 14-16 hours average
25-04-2019T01:15:56,CrimsonQuill,back
25-04-2019T01:16:47,CrimsonQuill,What programme are you guys talking about?
25-04-2019T01:17:56,Bgrmystr2,"Well, kiwi was just watching Ancient Magus Bride, but I didn't have any show specifically that I mentioned"
25-04-2019T01:18:18,CrimsonQuill,"Ooooh, I love that anime."
25-04-2019T01:18:30,CrimsonQuill,The music and story are very well done.
25-04-2019T01:18:50,Bgrmystr2,it's still on my watch list
25-04-2019T01:19:21,CrimsonQuill,I finally caught up to the current Twokinds comics.
25-04-2019T01:20:07,CrimsonQuill,"Now I am impatiently awaiting the next update, hoping against hope that Raine doesn't go feral in the next few chapters, and that Rose can teach her at least something to help her out..."
25-04-2019T01:20:37,CrimsonQuill,And that Maddie and Karen can be let out of that dungeon. Poor Madelyn.
25-04-2019T01:21:10,SpazztasticKiwi,I usually can’t help getting up and wondering around watching a series or whatever
25-04-2019T01:21:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Unless there’s a big reason to keep me in place
25-04-2019T01:21:51,CrimsonQuill,I've been procrastinating about Mob Psycho 100 season 2 for too long in that sort of manner...
25-04-2019T01:21:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I have a sort or short attention span
25-04-2019T01:21:58,SpazztasticKiwi,of
25-04-2019T01:22:05,CrimsonQuill,Same here.
25-04-2019T01:22:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Sometimes
25-04-2019T01:22:26,CrimsonQuill,Tom's drawing a new comic page tonight isn't he?
25-04-2019T01:22:41,CrimsonQuill,Because Fridays are stream nights...
25-04-2019T01:24:17,Bgrmystr2,"lol I highly doubt Raine will go Feral, there's too many people around her to help her through trauma. Also, the fact that she's human, originally, meaning one can just get her to spend all her magic as a keidran and she goes back to normal"
25-04-2019T01:24:28,CrimsonQuill,I really hope so.
25-04-2019T01:24:45,CrimsonQuill,Because if that happens after all the tosh she's been through I think I might cry.
25-04-2019T01:24:53,Bgrmystr2,"it's pretty easy to tell just from the concepts given by the comic, honestly."
25-04-2019T01:25:11,Bgrmystr2,and yeah that anime is one of many.
25-04-2019T01:25:29,Bgrmystr2,I just did a headcount of all the series I currently have selected post-HD-death
25-04-2019T01:25:34,CrimsonQuill,This comics makes me care so much about the characters...It's like Halo 4 or Princess Mononoke or Red vs Blue.
25-04-2019T01:25:42,CrimsonQuill,How many?
25-04-2019T01:25:52,Bgrmystr2,"stuff I remembered, and new stuff I wanted to note, and I'm sitting on 464"
25-04-2019T01:26:01,Bgrmystr2,not including ones I've already watched
25-04-2019T01:26:07,CrimsonQuill,Woah.
25-04-2019T01:26:46,Bgrmystr2,213 already watched within the past 4 years?
25-04-2019T01:26:49,CrimsonQuill,That's a lot.
25-04-2019T01:26:53,CrimsonQuill,Quite the binge.
25-04-2019T01:27:02,Bgrmystr2,sorta. I had way more than that
25-04-2019T01:27:14,CrimsonQuill,Wheesh...
25-04-2019T01:27:25,CrimsonQuill,I'm probably going to watch mine over summe.
25-04-2019T01:27:31,CrimsonQuill,When my exams are over.
25-04-2019T01:27:35,Bgrmystr2,probably 800+ series back in 2014 that I had just a massive list
25-04-2019T01:27:43,CrimsonQuill,800+???
25-04-2019T01:27:48,Bgrmystr2,now it's way more organized than it's ever been before but
25-04-2019T01:27:58,CrimsonQuill,CRUMBS!
25-04-2019T01:28:01,Bgrmystr2,I'm sad of the loss of previous list :/
25-04-2019T01:28:44,Bgrmystr2,"I fell off watching shows a few years prior to my drive dying, that's why I built up so many lol"
25-04-2019T01:29:07,Bgrmystr2,"cuz it doesn't just include new anime, but old classic anime"
25-04-2019T01:29:16,Bgrmystr2,like 1980s and 70s
25-04-2019T01:29:19,CrimsonQuill,I want to watch Cowboy Bebop myself.
25-04-2019T01:29:32,CrimsonQuill,And maybe Akira
25-04-2019T01:29:42,CrimsonQuill,And Mobile Suit Gundam.
25-04-2019T01:29:59,Bgrmystr2,"all sorts of new and old, variable ages, from rated everyone to adults, all sorts of genres, just about everything."
25-04-2019T01:30:13,Bgrmystr2,just poof ;~;
25-04-2019T01:30:20,CrimsonQuill,Whew.
25-04-2019T01:30:37,CrimsonQuill,"Heh, I'd watch the anime now..."
25-04-2019T01:30:43,CrimsonQuill,But I have exams in a few weeks.
25-04-2019T01:30:56,CrimsonQuill,And at the moment all I can think about is Halo and Twokinds.
25-04-2019T01:51:40,SpazztasticKiwi,My taste nowadays is everyone but if there happens to be adult stuff I don’t bat an eye anymore
25-04-2019T01:52:28,CrimsonQuill,"For me, I can handle gore...and the odd heartwarming smooch...but any further than that and I tend to turn away till it's over...awkward..."
25-04-2019T01:52:48,Bgrmystr2,"""odd"" lol"
25-04-2019T01:53:07,CrimsonQuill,"Then again, I keep trying to find ways of using Tucker's ""Bow chicka Bow Wow"" catchphrase from RvB, so even I'm not that good..."
25-04-2019T01:53:21,CrimsonQuill,I just do become a bit uncomfortable.
25-04-2019T01:54:09,CrimsonQuill,"Heh, I like that word though...""smooch""...blast it, Calvin and Hobbes! :ptv-laugh:"
25-04-2019T02:01:22,CrimsonQuill,"Ok, I'm off-I have to shower and dress"
25-04-2019T02:01:31,CrimsonQuill,:ptv-victory::ptv-greetings:
25-04-2019T02:35:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Gore wasn’t my focus
25-04-2019T02:36:00,SpazztasticKiwi,And it doesn’t bother me but ok
25-04-2019T02:37:04,Bgrmystr2,"it doesn't bother me unless it ends up being remotely realistic. I still don't have a problem with it, but my stomach sure fuckin does, so I can't watch any of that. Especially ordinary movies."
25-04-2019T02:38:03,CrimsonQuill,"I'm back. Again. By the way, what time is it for you guys? It's 8:37am here."
25-04-2019T02:38:18,Bgrmystr2,2:38am bro
25-04-2019T02:38:31,Bgrmystr2,I'd be sleeping if I lived where you are.
25-04-2019T02:38:35,Bgrmystr2,at that time.
25-04-2019T02:38:44,SpazztasticKiwi,I watch and own too many horror movies. Desensitize yourself
25-04-2019T02:38:49,SpazztasticKiwi,I love em
25-04-2019T02:38:56,CrimsonQuill,Jeepers.
25-04-2019T02:38:59,Bgrmystr2,you think I didn't try?
25-04-2019T02:39:03,CrimsonQuill,I don't like horror...
25-04-2019T02:39:13,CrimsonQuill,Though Alien and Aliens are rather good.
25-04-2019T02:39:20,Bgrmystr2,"fact is, it actually got worse"
25-04-2019T02:39:23,CrimsonQuill,I never play horror games either.
25-04-2019T02:39:24,Bgrmystr2,not better
25-04-2019T02:39:37,CrimsonQuill,Desensitising efforts Bgr?
25-04-2019T02:39:41,CrimsonQuill,I know the feeling.
25-04-2019T02:39:48,Bgrmystr2,uhhuh...
25-04-2019T02:40:03,Bgrmystr2,"It's only that though, everything else works fine"
25-04-2019T02:40:11,Bgrmystr2,so I dunno
25-04-2019T02:40:39,CrimsonQuill,I tend to filter my horror through youtubers.
25-04-2019T02:40:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve gotten to where I can see special effects I guess on most stuff. Maybe watching how it was done extras could help
25-04-2019T02:41:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Or watching horror comedies
25-04-2019T02:41:06,Bgrmystr2,that doesn't help either lol
25-04-2019T02:41:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Tho it’s whatever
25-04-2019T02:41:14,Bgrmystr2,"been there, got that tshirt."
25-04-2019T02:41:19,Bgrmystr2,had to put it in the wash too
25-04-2019T02:41:48,Bgrmystr2,"Honestly, I've long been desensitivised to adult content or weapons, or fighting, all of that.."
25-04-2019T02:42:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Speaking of horror ERB did a Freddy Kruger/Wolverine bit
25-04-2019T02:42:22,Bgrmystr2,"but when it comes to realistic damage to someone's body, my stomach just nopes the hell out"
25-04-2019T02:42:44,CrimsonQuill,I can see why that would make you do so...
25-04-2019T02:42:53,CrimsonQuill,I get queasy myself.
25-04-2019T02:43:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Saw would throw you for a loop then
25-04-2019T02:43:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Or the Ruins. That ones good
25-04-2019T02:43:54,Bgrmystr2,"I don't even have a weak constitution or whatever the thing is, cuz I love heights, though I dare not stand near the edge cuz I know damn well somethin stupid will happen and that'll be the end of me"
25-04-2019T02:44:23,Bgrmystr2,"I don't fear heights, definitely not, cuz it's great, but I do absoluetly fear fallin off XD"
25-04-2019T02:44:28,Bgrmystr2,fuck all o dat
25-04-2019T02:44:32,CrimsonQuill,"Do you ever get the sudden urge to jump, despite your survival instinct screaming to get back?"
25-04-2019T02:44:36,Bgrmystr2,no
25-04-2019T02:44:40,CrimsonQuill,"Also, you shouldn't fear the fall."
25-04-2019T02:44:41,Bgrmystr2,never ever.
25-04-2019T02:44:44,CrimsonQuill,Fear the landing.
25-04-2019T02:44:46,Bgrmystr2,nope
25-04-2019T02:44:55,Bgrmystr2,"fear the fall. the fall is what kills you, not the landing"
25-04-2019T02:44:56,CrimsonQuill,"I'm afraid not of heights, but grounds."
25-04-2019T02:45:08,Bgrmystr2,"you're dead before you hit the groud, your brain accepts death and shuts down prior."
25-04-2019T02:45:13,CrimsonQuill,And it is not the fall that kills but the landing afterward.
25-04-2019T02:45:22,Bgrmystr2,"then you need to brush up on science, bro"
25-04-2019T02:45:31,SpazztasticKiwi,I do t get along with heights. Big thing with my ex was I did not like being picked up
25-04-2019T02:45:33,CrimsonQuill,I know one passes out in a fall.
25-04-2019T02:45:43,CrimsonQuill,But the landing is what is the most dangerous.
25-04-2019T02:46:11,Bgrmystr2,there's lots of medical shows and other kinds of informational shows and documentaries
25-04-2019T02:46:16,Bgrmystr2,plenty of medical studies
25-04-2019T02:46:36,CrimsonQuill,I see.
25-04-2019T02:46:40,Bgrmystr2,all of them state that the acceptance of death during falling is what will kill you before you hit the ground
25-04-2019T02:46:55,Bgrmystr2,but of course most of that was tested off like.. skyscrapers and bridges and such
25-04-2019T02:46:55,Bgrmystr2,xD
25-04-2019T02:47:04,CrimsonQuill,Does it say anything about his house?
25-04-2019T02:47:11,CrimsonQuill,And the lifetimer rooms?
25-04-2019T02:47:12,CrimsonQuill,No?
25-04-2019T02:47:25,Bgrmystr2,if you fall off like.. 4 stories and break your neck.. then yeah the impact is probably what will kill you lol
25-04-2019T02:47:25,CrimsonQuill,(I have got to stop referencing Discworld)
25-04-2019T02:47:31,SpazztasticKiwi,What does that have to do with the price of tea in China
25-04-2019T02:47:42,CrimsonQuill,He mentioned accepting Death.
25-04-2019T02:47:56,CrimsonQuill,I cannot imagine Death without imagining...Death. Discworld Death.
25-04-2019T02:47:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Nm It’s over your head and below your feet
25-04-2019T02:48:17,CrimsonQuill,"Yeah, I'm a bit stupid."
25-04-2019T02:48:47,Bgrmystr2,"I don't know where Discworld came from, nor do I know where the price of tea in China came from either.. but if the tea does not explode, it is not true China quality."
25-04-2019T02:48:58,CrimsonQuill,XD
25-04-2019T02:49:07,CrimsonQuill,Oh dear
25-04-2019T02:49:15,CrimsonQuill,I have to go again.
25-04-2019T02:49:17,CrimsonQuill,For a while.
25-04-2019T02:49:19,Bgrmystr2,okay
25-04-2019T02:49:21,SpazztasticKiwi,More like some people don’t get my sayings because they’re so heavily southern
25-04-2019T02:49:22,CrimsonQuill,Cheerio
25-04-2019T02:49:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Most of the time
25-04-2019T02:49:29,CrimsonQuill,:ptv-greetings::ptv-greetings::ptv-greetings:
25-04-2019T02:51:56,Bgrmystr2,I mean.. I lived in Georgia half my life and Louisiana the other half.. and I still have no idea what you're on about
25-04-2019T02:51:59,Bgrmystr2,so XD
25-04-2019T02:51:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Why are you up so late if you’re in the same time zone
25-04-2019T02:52:39,Bgrmystr2,like.. me? I'm always up this late lol
25-04-2019T02:53:06,SpazztasticKiwi,That was what the question was for I know I was asking why
25-04-2019T02:53:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Speech dictation is great until you realize it doesn’t add punctuation
25-04-2019T02:53:24,Bgrmystr2,hmm
25-04-2019T02:53:28,Bgrmystr2,I'm not a morning person
25-04-2019T02:53:33,Bgrmystr2,"they suck, and I hate them"
25-04-2019T02:53:40,Bgrmystr2,and everyone I know is up all hours of the night
25-04-2019T02:54:08,Bgrmystr2,"so I usually wake up in the afternoon between 2 and 3pm, right about when other people I know are either getting up or finishing whatever they do"
25-04-2019T02:54:42,Bgrmystr2,gives me a few hours in the morning w/ friends in europe too
25-04-2019T03:02:32,SpazztasticKiwi,I believe I’m up because I’ve got internet
25-04-2019T03:02:45,SpazztasticKiwi,And Bagheera seems to be tripping some acid on the bed
25-04-2019T03:25:59,Bgrmystr2,Sometimes I want a cat.
25-04-2019T03:26:05,Bgrmystr2,And sometimes I don't.
25-04-2019T04:46:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Meet someone with a cat. You’ll have the fun of getting to see them. The fun or seeing and part time owning the cat
25-04-2019T04:46:34,SpazztasticKiwi,of
25-04-2019T04:47:07,SpazztasticKiwi,🛌
25-04-2019T05:04:53,Bgrmystr2,yeah but cats don't like people that aren't their owners lol

25-04-2019T14:02:10,CrimsonQuill,"And I was wondering if the comic page where Karen jumps on Raine, yelling, ""DOGGY!"" is a Freefall reference?>"
25-04-2019T14:02:26,CrimsonQuill,Because I only read Freefall at the end of last year.

25-04-2019T14:11:28,CrimsonQuill,"Because I am really worried about poor Raine, and want to see how Rose'll try to help."
25-04-2019T14:22:37,CrimsonQuill,And it'd be a good read for tomorrow
25-04-2019T14:29:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Anyone heard of horchow
25-04-2019T14:31:59,TerraTheWizard,nope
25-04-2019T14:41:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Apparently it’s a furniture decor thing store
25-04-2019T14:41:36,SpazztasticKiwi,We got a magofrom them today but it’s got some lady’s name on it
25-04-2019T14:41:59,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s no Jennifer on our road let alone in our household
25-04-2019T14:42:26,CrimsonQuill,'magofrom' or 'mag from'?
25-04-2019T14:43:34,Twokinds,Yes I'll be doing a comic tonight probably
25-04-2019T14:48:25,CrimsonQuill,Lovely
25-04-2019T14:48:29,CrimsonQuill,Something for tomorrow
25-04-2019T14:49:14,CrimsonQuill,Just very hyped
25-04-2019T14:49:32,CrimsonQuill,I am currently have more concern for the characters than for politics.
25-04-2019T14:49:39,CrimsonQuill,I am happy for that.
25-04-2019T14:53:48,Twokinds,lol
25-04-2019T14:53:56,Twokinds,I'm glad some people are
25-04-2019T14:54:20,CrimsonQuill,Literally all I can think about are Twokinds and Halo
25-04-2019T14:54:49,CrimsonQuill,"And most of my focus in Twokinds is on Madelyn and Karen, Raine, Red and Rose, and Trace and Flora."
25-04-2019T14:55:22,CrimsonQuill,"Arrrgh, I want to know what'll happen next, but at the same time I'm afraid to see in case it's something terrible!"
25-04-2019T14:55:45,CrimsonQuill,I don't want to see any of them hurt...and Raine's fears are really getting to me...
25-04-2019T14:56:04,CrimsonQuill,Not to mention Evil Black Smoke Hallucination's still hanging around...
25-04-2019T14:56:07,SpazztasticKiwi,I want to know who’s buying stuff from this catalog
25-04-2019T14:56:17,CrimsonQuill,"Dammit Tom, this comic is too much emotion for me!"
25-04-2019T14:56:20,CrimsonQuill,:)
25-04-2019T14:56:42,SpazztasticKiwi,$3000+ rugs. Why
25-04-2019T14:56:58,CrimsonQuill,"I don't know, Spazz. I don't know."
25-04-2019T14:58:02,SpazztasticKiwi,$119 for a tablecloth and napkins. They better serve me Beauty and the Beast style
25-04-2019T14:58:22,SpazztasticKiwi,For people with more money than common sense
25-04-2019T15:02:57,CrimsonQuill,I'll buy something better value and longer lasting thanks.
25-04-2019T15:03:04,CrimsonQuill,I prefer common sense
25-04-2019T15:07:54,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m excited for TK. I’m just buzzing on the inside
25-04-2019T15:08:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Contained chaos
25-04-2019T15:08:36,CrimsonQuill,Excited and apprehensive.
25-04-2019T15:08:46,CrimsonQuill,I'm terrified that someone might die or worse.
25-04-2019T15:08:52,CrimsonQuill,I care for them.
25-04-2019T15:08:55,CrimsonQuill,All of them.
25-04-2019T15:09:15,CrimsonQuill,Clovis and Brahn'd better get their arses kicked soundly...

25-04-2019T16:37:39,TeapotOfDoom,Hi quill!
25-04-2019T16:37:49,CrimsonQuill,Hello Teapot!
25-04-2019T16:42:04,TeapotOfDoom,I heard there'a a new page coming. I'm intruiged
25-04-2019T16:42:22,CrimsonQuill,I won't see it till tomorrow.
25-04-2019T16:42:37,TeapotOfDoom,yeah probably the same for me
25-04-2019T16:42:37,CrimsonQuill,But I'm anxious for what happens....
25-04-2019T16:42:46,TerraTheWizard,things
25-04-2019T16:42:48,TerraTheWizard,and stuff
25-04-2019T16:42:55,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-rainehappy:
25-04-2019T16:43:39,CrimsonQuill,"As long as Roselyn is able to help Raine, or at least comfort her..."
25-04-2019T16:44:08,TeapotOfDoom,well i suppose she already knows who raine is at this point
25-04-2019T16:44:17,CrimsonQuill,I'd think so.
25-04-2019T16:44:27,CrimsonQuill,But I'm terrified for her...
25-04-2019T16:44:37,CrimsonQuill,The sleepwalking and awkward changes...
25-04-2019T16:45:09,CrimsonQuill,At least Red's actually trying to help.
25-04-2019T16:45:14,CrimsonQuill,And he had a good idea.
25-04-2019T16:45:37,TeapotOfDoom,well i suppose she has to learn how to control her magic
25-04-2019T16:45:45,CrimsonQuill,Absolutely.
25-04-2019T16:46:25,CrimsonQuill,And I do hope we see her unlock her ability...
25-04-2019T16:46:36,TeapotOfDoom,well that could get interesting
25-04-2019T16:47:29,TeapotOfDoom,judging by her parents raine would become a pretty powerfull mage if that happens
25-04-2019T16:47:37,CrimsonQuill,I hope it happens.
25-04-2019T16:47:42,CrimsonQuill,If only for her safety.
25-04-2019T16:47:57,TeapotOfDoom,and would spice things up a notch
25-04-2019T16:48:10,CrimsonQuill,"Well, Raine and Red seem to be complementing one another."
25-04-2019T16:48:30,CrimsonQuill,"She's teaching him to think about others and not be racist, he's teaching her to be more confident in herself."
25-04-2019T16:48:48,CrimsonQuill,It's one of the reasons I love the pairing so much.
25-04-2019T16:49:24,TeapotOfDoom,jup can agree
25-04-2019T16:50:17,TeapotOfDoom,would be hillarious if red had any keidran ancestors tho. too bad that joke was already blown
25-04-2019T16:56:30,CrimsonQuill,"Talking about Raine, I am wondering why she of all the characters has pads on her hands as a Keidran, whereas a normal Keidran doesn't..."
25-04-2019T17:00:22,TeapotOfDoom,had to look it up i never noticed
25-04-2019T17:00:47,TeapotOfDoom,thats actually a good question i have no idea. tom?
25-04-2019T17:00:52,Bgrmystr2,"hmm, since tom is doing the new comic page tonight, I'm guessing we're rolling with Raine and losing her ears in between pages"
25-04-2019T17:01:13,CrimsonQuill,"Well, the poor woman's a bucket of emotion."
25-04-2019T17:01:23,tehbear,"im guessing its because it was a lot of work to do pawpads on earlier wolf characters, but tom wanted raine to be special"
25-04-2019T17:01:24,CrimsonQuill,So I think the ears might flick in and out.
25-04-2019T17:01:32,CrimsonQuill,Perhaps...
25-04-2019T17:01:41,CrimsonQuill,I am treating myself tonight.
25-04-2019T17:02:01,Bgrmystr2,"xD You guys don't have to guess, it was just an oversight. I'm thinking he just decided to roll with it since he hadn't fixed it."
25-04-2019T17:02:08,CrimsonQuill,"I can't watch the stream (and generally read the finished comic anyhow), but I have something else..."
25-04-2019T17:02:15,CrimsonQuill,If he rolls with it that's fine.
25-04-2019T17:02:52,CrimsonQuill,But the expressions....you can see how deeply Red cares for her.
25-04-2019T17:03:03,CrimsonQuill,"Anyhow, soon I think I shall leave."
25-04-2019T17:03:15,tehbear,Red Raine Rose
25-04-2019T17:03:17,CrimsonQuill,But I'm going to have some fun before bed...
25-04-2019T17:03:22,SpazztasticKiwi,"Ah. You return. As for that last cat comment, some cats are more people social than others. Like Kiwi hates men but warmed up to my female friend while Bagheera is wary of strangers"
25-04-2019T17:03:36,SpazztasticKiwi,And Tom has said Holly isn’t a people cat
25-04-2019T17:03:37,TeapotOfDoom,i'll have to stick to that too probably. pretty late for me
25-04-2019T17:03:40,CrimsonQuill,"Cats are always nices, Spazztastic."
25-04-2019T17:03:56,tehbear,have some rest and recreation Crimson
25-04-2019T17:03:56,Bgrmystr2,"""always nices"" Kiwi literally confirmed that not all cats are nices"
25-04-2019T17:04:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Though I have a friend with cats who’ll happily approach strangers
25-04-2019T17:04:03,Bgrmystr2,good try lol
25-04-2019T17:04:24,Bgrmystr2,"and yeah I do return, hello kiwi good morning"
25-04-2019T17:04:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Depends very much on the cat
25-04-2019T17:04:53,CrimsonQuill,"Since I finally finished Halo 4 Legendary again (so many deaths, and *sob* Cortana!) I'm going to rewatch the stream where Halo Raine was sketched, and watch a few Halo music videos before bed."
25-04-2019T17:05:04,SpazztasticKiwi,So maybe you can meet a person whose cat hates the very sight of you or maybe it’ll immediately become attached. No tellin
25-04-2019T17:05:19,SpazztasticKiwi,5 pm is hardly morning
25-04-2019T17:05:37,TeapotOfDoom,(is it bad that i don't know anything about halo?)
25-04-2019T17:05:39,CrimsonQuill,"Oh, sorry-I know what you mean Spazz."
25-04-2019T17:06:05,TeapotOfDoom,well 5am is better than 3am
25-04-2019T17:06:06,CrimsonQuill,"@TeapotOfDoom no, it's alright, I'm just an over-enthusiastic fan."
25-04-2019T17:06:10,Bgrmystr2,I woke up. It's morning
25-04-2019T17:06:19,SpazztasticKiwi,a whole mood
25-04-2019T17:06:24,Bgrmystr2,deal with it :dark_sunglasses:
25-04-2019T17:06:30,Bgrmystr2,mood and a half
25-04-2019T17:06:31,tehbear,what game did you start with Crim?
25-04-2019T17:06:33,Bgrmystr2,whatever that means
25-04-2019T17:06:43,CrimsonQuill,@tehbear Halo 4
25-04-2019T17:06:49,CrimsonQuill,I love the story to bits
25-04-2019T17:07:13,TeapotOfDoom,the only thing i knew was cortana. and considering what microsoft did to her...
25-04-2019T17:07:18,CrimsonQuill,Gameplay...can become rather tedious on Legendary (although that could be because I'm really bad)
25-04-2019T17:07:29,CrimsonQuill,Cortana in 4 was beautifully done.
25-04-2019T17:07:43,CrimsonQuill,Cortana in 5...was a punch in the gut and a knife to the eye...
25-04-2019T17:07:49,TeapotOfDoom,cortana in windows is awfully annoying
25-04-2019T17:07:59,CrimsonQuill,I like her in Windows 10
25-04-2019T17:08:04,CrimsonQuill,She likes Red vs Blue
25-04-2019T17:08:08,tehbear,"interesting. Halo 4 was the first non Bungie Halo, instead it was made by 343 industries. TIL."
25-04-2019T17:08:11,CrimsonQuill,It makes her wonder why we're here.
25-04-2019T17:08:19,CrimsonQuill,I've played 4 and Reach.
25-04-2019T17:08:23,CrimsonQuill,I love 'em both.
25-04-2019T17:08:33,CrimsonQuill,Though I admit that the best armour is in Reach.
25-04-2019T17:08:50,CrimsonQuill,"Mind, there are a few in 4 that are awesome."
25-04-2019T17:08:51,TeapotOfDoom,dunno always deactivated her before she could finish her first sentence

25-04-2019T17:09:32,CrimsonQuill,And...
25-04-2019T17:09:40,tehbear,"but then, i do love Resident Evil 4, but never played the previous ones much"

25-04-2019T17:10:28,CrimsonQuill,@TeapotOfDoom is it like Agent Georgia?
25-04-2019T17:10:37,CrimsonQuill,Or is it THAT sort of don't ask?

25-04-2019T17:12:12,CrimsonQuill,Good idea.
25-04-2019T17:12:16,TeapotOfDoom,yeah...

25-04-2019T17:13:07,TeapotOfDoom,playing halo rn?
25-04-2019T17:13:20,CrimsonQuill,XD My best friend and I spent half an hour team killing each other in Firefight with low gravity!
25-04-2019T17:13:28,CrimsonQuill,It was a barrage of RvB references.
25-04-2019T17:13:56,CrimsonQuill,"Tom, you there?"
25-04-2019T17:14:05,CrimsonQuill,I need to ask something important if you are
25-04-2019T17:14:14,tehbear,goofing about in MP is sometimes way more fun that playing a game seriously
25-04-2019T17:14:16,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m off to pop in SM Homecoming before my brain goes numb

25-04-2019T17:15:15,TeapotOfDoom,kinda dodged the franchise until now

25-04-2019T17:16:13,TeapotOfDoom,uuuh eigenvektors are fun
25-04-2019T17:16:28,TeapotOfDoom,are we talking about 2x2 or 3x3
25-04-2019T17:16:33,CrimsonQuill,2x2
25-04-2019T17:16:45,CrimsonQuill,They're fun enough once I know what I'm doing.
25-04-2019T17:16:55,CrimsonQuill,It's just that I don't know what I'm doing.
25-04-2019T17:17:21,CrimsonQuill,"Least Squares Adjustment, Determinants and Fourier equations however make me shiver..."

25-04-2019T17:18:23,TeapotOfDoom,i cant think of a bad pun
25-04-2019T17:18:29,CrimsonQuill,I can probably chat to Tom tomorrow.
25-04-2019T17:18:36,TeapotOfDoom,ok good luck

25-04-2019T20:21:45,CrRAR,Work knows 0 chill lately
25-04-2019T20:21:47,SageSaga,Tharkis- did you make your animated emotes or did ya have someone make them for ya?
25-04-2019T20:22:48,Tharkis,"i commissioned an artist KDhynamo to do the base images, and then i did the animations myself"
25-04-2019T20:22:51,SpinoSpiritNinja,Hello
25-04-2019T20:22:55,Nekonny,They were comissions from someone on the KB?
25-04-2019T20:23:05,Nekonny,Oh right
25-04-2019T20:23:07,Nekonny,KD XD
25-04-2019T20:23:17,BadFoMo,KD?
25-04-2019T20:23:19,Tharkis,but i only really draw stickfigures myself
25-04-2019T20:23:22,SageSaga,you should be able to clean up the white edges a lot
25-04-2019T20:23:26,FoxxTrotter,"KDhynamo, FoMo."
25-04-2019T20:23:41,Nekonny,with photoshopo

25-04-2019T20:24:03,Bgrmystr2,"He already said who it was before you asked, fomo xD"
25-04-2019T20:24:07,SageSaga,like its fine to keep the white around it- make it kinda sticker/chibi like-
25-04-2019T20:24:31,SageSaga,but it's not smooth as is and would look a lot better if ya had time to clean em up
25-04-2019T20:24:34,BadFoMo,My brain farted again.
25-04-2019T20:24:59,Tharkis,it's a problem with the compression down to 50x50 =/
25-04-2019T20:25:10,Tharkis,they look way better at actual size heh
25-04-2019T20:25:16,SageSaga,it can still be fixed :P
25-04-2019T20:25:42,SageSaga,ya just gotta fix it at the right size
25-04-2019T20:25:45,SpinoSpiritNinja,Is this all done in Photoshop?
25-04-2019T20:26:14,CrRAR,"Tom - yes, others no"
25-04-2019T20:26:32,Tharkis,i tried them without the white border and they disapear into the new (well not new any longer) color scheme on picarto  unfortunately =(

25-04-2019T20:27:00,SpinoSpiritNinja,Would it not be easier to use illustrator?
25-04-2019T20:27:03,AskNeonFlash,How is everyone's evening
25-04-2019T20:27:05,Tharkis,that one i made better by removing only the whte on the section that moves
25-04-2019T20:27:35,Bgrmystr2,"Probably not, Ninja"
25-04-2019T20:28:39,SageSaga,if i still had photoshop i'd clean it up for ya Tharkis XD

25-04-2019T21:21:52,Nekonny,not sure how that would work though
25-04-2019T21:22:46,MrMongMong,It could be like a loot crate style thing with everyones books packed into it?
25-04-2019T21:24:24,SageSaga,would get expensive fast
25-04-2019T21:24:42,KDhynamo,Hello
25-04-2019T21:24:44,Nekonny,or random assortment of books

25-04-2019T21:26:04,Nekonny,that we can't destroy
25-04-2019T21:26:18,Nekonny,harbinger of doom
25-04-2019T21:26:27,BadFoMo,What abut everyone working on the same comic? Like everyone drawing their own charactors in their own style enteracting with the other artist's charactros which are in their style?
25-04-2019T21:26:28,Nekonny,ahem
25-04-2019T21:26:32,Tharkis,no it was my fault i'm re-exporting the gif right now lol
25-04-2019T21:26:48,Tharkis,but i have to take the 8 frames and order them to make a 47ish frame earwiggle
25-04-2019T21:26:48,BadFoMo,...If that made any sence.
25-04-2019T21:27:05,SageSaga,that's a ton of work FoMo

25-04-2019T21:27:22,BadFoMo,Yep...
25-04-2019T21:27:24,Tharkis,"it's 8 frames, but to do a double earwiggle with a pause between you have to duplicate frames a whole ton :ctharkis-earwiggle:"
25-04-2019T21:27:34,Nekonny,"yeah, not enough time even if it were viable"
25-04-2019T21:27:50,BluePhantom90,SOOOOOOooo Who seen Avengers Endgame?
25-04-2019T21:27:55,Supahbuzzer,me

25-04-2019T21:29:03,BadFoMo,...What about something like Heavy Metal? Several short stories that are linked by this one thing?
25-04-2019T21:29:07,BluePhantom90,lol Oh I can just ruin it for you all right now -laughs evilly- besides one
25-04-2019T21:29:08,SageSaga,as i said last week  - if anyone spoils - fake or not gets banned
25-04-2019T21:29:09,Supahbuzzer,fine have it your way. RIP wolf raine (at least the main story)
25-04-2019T21:29:25,Supahbuzzer,until further notice
25-04-2019T21:29:34,Tharkis,[dont even talk about it!]*:ctharkis-angry:
25-04-2019T21:29:34,Bgrmystr2,in b4 blue gets banned for testing the waters
25-04-2019T21:30:46,BluePhantom90,"I don't really understand why people are crazy about people spoiling. I sometimes enjoy Spoilers, helps me notice other stuff I wouldn't have notice if I knew that was going to happen"
25-04-2019T21:31:13,Bgrmystr2,because people want to experience it as it was intended to. Watching it the first time.
25-04-2019T21:31:18,Flake,people like experiencing stuff for themselves
25-04-2019T21:31:22,MuonNeutrino,"well, please just understand that even if you don't care about spoilers, other people VERY definitely do"
25-04-2019T21:31:23,Flake,it ruins the fun
25-04-2019T21:31:40,ColonelFox,it ruins the excitement of seeing something for the first time
25-04-2019T21:31:54,Bgrmystr2,"the same could be said of most people, Fox"
25-04-2019T21:33:27,BluePhantom90,I mean the Harry Potter stories or movie endings I didn't mind. Plus it kinda confirmed my theory when I was younger
25-04-2019T21:33:46,Bgrmystr2,"Don't be that person, blue"
25-04-2019T21:34:25,Nekonny,way to hijack the conversation
25-04-2019T21:34:39,Bgrmystr2,prettymuch
25-04-2019T21:34:51,KDhynamo,yeah I'm no animator

25-04-2019T21:44:38,Tharkis,"warning is smaller than tharkitty, and tharkis the maid witch is smol at 4 foot 8 / 143cm"
25-04-2019T21:44:41,Sclimshady,Yeah

25-04-2019T21:44:42,Tharkis,warning is only like 100cm
25-04-2019T21:44:55,ZRO4825,"Warning? She's...what, Fluff, like barely 4 foot?"

25-04-2019T21:45:16,Nekonny,that reminds me
25-04-2019T21:45:29,Nekonny,I wanted to get some sort of 3d print of shu someday
25-04-2019T21:45:35,ZRO4825,"Do we even have an official height for Warning? She's typically just ""shortstack"" status. :joy:"
25-04-2019T21:45:42,Nekonny,and I was considering changing her name too...
25-04-2019T21:45:54,MuonNeutrino,suspicion intensifying....
25-04-2019T21:45:58,ZRO4825,"You need to do more art sets like you did with Dusk, Ron! =D"
25-04-2019T21:46:04,Nekonny,Can I request a ref link?
25-04-2019T21:46:17,Nekonny,since I'm obviously out of the loop
25-04-2019T21:46:19,ZRO4825,"For who, Warning?"

25-04-2019T21:48:25,Flake,she's super cute!
25-04-2019T21:48:35,Tharkis,i think i slowed the ears down a little bit when i made it this time
25-04-2019T21:48:41,Tharkis,couldnt remember the speed i had for the wiggle
25-04-2019T21:49:13,Nekonny,wigglebost
25-04-2019T21:49:17,Nekonny,Oh!
25-04-2019T21:49:24,KDhynamo,"why did you need to remake it, btw?"
25-04-2019T21:49:31,ZRO4825,"Personally, Fluff, I would've linked one of the ones with her next to someone else so you can see how short she is....Most of those aren't good for refs though, lol."
25-04-2019T21:49:36,Nekonny,I unlocked the secret to ear wiggle in  emofuri XD

25-04-2019T21:51:02,Tharkis,@KDhynamo  the white border irritated Sage =D
25-04-2019T21:51:04,Nekonny,I think it happens more on head rotation...
25-04-2019T21:51:06,RimaDraws,ouch
25-04-2019T21:51:11,BadFoMo,Dang.

25-04-2019T21:53:14,BadFoMo,"So, Rose /can/ transform."
25-04-2019T21:53:29,MuonNeutrino,yup
25-04-2019T21:53:31,Bgrmystr2,oh shit
25-04-2019T21:53:39,MuonNeutrino,i remember speculating about this in the very thread she was re-introduced in
25-04-2019T21:53:49,BadFoMo,That exloans the long life.
25-04-2019T21:53:55,MuonNeutrino,because tom showed a snippet of a sketch with a human rose
25-04-2019T21:54:00,BadFoMo,*explans
25-04-2019T21:54:06,MuonNeutrino,i've been wondering ever since if that was actually going to be a thing
25-04-2019T21:54:21,FoxxTrotter,Yes...I saw those sketches a while back.
25-04-2019T21:54:28,BadFoMo,"Fingers/Brain! WFT, yo?!"
25-04-2019T21:54:29,ContagiousBordem16,If Natani can use magic. Can they transform
25-04-2019T21:54:30,BluePhantom90,kinda explains how she lived so long
25-04-2019T21:54:32,Nekonny,(focus ron...)
25-04-2019T21:54:34,Bgrmystr2,Did he? I didn't see it
25-04-2019T21:54:42,BadFoMo,AH! *WTF
25-04-2019T21:54:45,MuonNeutrino,as soon as i saw tom re-dividing the bottom panels and rose taking off her glasses my brain started ticking
25-04-2019T21:54:55,MuonNeutrino,'why would she need to take off the glasses?'
25-04-2019T21:55:03,MuonNeutrino,unless they suddenly weren't about to fit on her face >.>
25-04-2019T21:55:30,Bgrmystr2,her eyes are lookin.. very offset there
25-04-2019T21:55:32,Bgrmystr2,in the last panel
25-04-2019T21:56:52,MuonNeutrino,.... lol
25-04-2019T21:56:57,MuonNeutrino,just realized
25-04-2019T21:57:01,MuonNeutrino,that line in the rose ref sheet
25-04-2019T21:57:05,MuonNeutrino,'some magical talent'
25-04-2019T21:57:09,MuonNeutrino,tom you *troll* lol
25-04-2019T21:57:13,RimaDraws,WHAT?!

25-04-2019T21:57:35,CrimsonHelsing,Say whaaaaaaaaaaaaat?!
25-04-2019T21:57:38,MuonNeutrino,"well, if euchre can...."
25-04-2019T21:57:41,RimaDraws,holy hell
25-04-2019T21:57:44,Aimbotexe,I can already see all the human rose suggestions sunday
25-04-2019T21:57:57,Sclimshady,Well she was using illusion magic when she was caught by the templar
25-04-2019T21:58:09,MuonNeutrino,i've been expecting this scene for two years heh
25-04-2019T21:58:17,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Trace walks in ""I can human too, you're not special!"""
25-04-2019T21:58:27,ContagiousBordem16,Is rose old?
25-04-2019T21:58:32,ZRO4825,"Technically, yes."
25-04-2019T21:58:33,MuonNeutrino,"for a keidran, yes"
25-04-2019T21:58:37,ZRO4825,At least by Keidran standards.
25-04-2019T21:58:45,Bgrmystr2,yeah she is
25-04-2019T21:58:51,ContagiousBordem16,What?!
25-04-2019T21:58:53,RimaDraws,o.o
25-04-2019T21:59:04,Bgrmystr2,why is that surprising lol
25-04-2019T21:59:08,ContagiousBordem16,But she was so qcuuute
25-04-2019T21:59:09,ZRO4825,"Must be a Serena month of sorts, Sage, what with 2 different colored pics of her, lol"
25-04-2019T21:59:24,MuonNeutrino,"if someone has grey hair, isn't it kinda the assumption that they're old?"
25-04-2019T21:59:35,MuonNeutrino,"i mean, grey streaks, not just silver hair like raine"
25-04-2019T21:59:42,CrimsonHelsing,This is a nice... *whoosh!* whatatwist! : D
25-04-2019T21:59:52,Ordithus,:csagesaga-c3: good evening!
25-04-2019T21:59:55,Bgrmystr2,Hey Ord
25-04-2019T21:59:56,MuonNeutrino,"rose is in her upper 20s, which is very oldfor a keidran"
25-04-2019T22:00:02,BadFoMo,Rose: Strong magic runs in our family. Some of us think that we my not have started out as Keidran. Maybe not Human eather.
25-04-2019T22:00:02,ContagiousBordem16,Hi orth
25-04-2019T22:00:09,Ordithus,"If I was a Keidran, I'd be dead :D"

25-04-2019T22:00:15,Sclimshady,Hey Ord
25-04-2019T22:00:17,BadFoMo,Same.
25-04-2019T22:00:20,Bgrmystr2,"I can't remember any instance of rose transforming into a human, so this is news to me"
25-04-2019T22:00:33,CrimsonHelsing,Their family *has* to be descended from sn original hybrid!
25-04-2019T22:00:33,ContagiousBordem16,If I were a human how old would I be?
25-04-2019T22:00:43,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno, how old are you now?"
25-04-2019T22:00:45,Alphawolf333,also I guess it makes sense too since her glasses have arms
25-04-2019T22:00:53,MuonNeutrino,"@Bgrmystr2 she never has, but in the stream for the comic way back in 2017 where rose was first seen as the seneschal tom showed a snippet of a sketch with wolf rose next to human rose"
25-04-2019T22:01:06,Ordithus,I figured that was just for fun
25-04-2019T22:01:14,Nekonny,"""  way back in 2017 ""  T_T"
25-04-2019T22:01:14,MuonNeutrino,"well, it certainly could have been"
25-04-2019T22:01:19,Bgrmystr2,"I was there, and I do not think he did?"
25-04-2019T22:01:21,ContagiousBordem16,Where’s sage?
25-04-2019T22:01:24,MuonNeutrino,but i've been suspicious about it ever since then
25-04-2019T22:01:29,Nekonny,at home
25-04-2019T22:01:31,BadFoMo,I don't know what I thought.
25-04-2019T22:01:35,MuonNeutrino,"he did, i even talked about it right after in the thread for that comic"
25-04-2019T22:01:36,ContagiousBordem16,Lol
25-04-2019T22:01:37,KDhynamo,I'm 27 and have gray hair in my temples
25-04-2019T22:01:38,Alphawolf333,Possibly not being able to connect to picarto
25-04-2019T22:01:56,Bgrmystr2,well I'm not on the forums so you can throw that out lol
25-04-2019T22:02:04,BadFoMo,@MuonNeutrino He did?
25-04-2019T22:02:11,MuonNeutrino,point being as evidence that he did show it =P
25-04-2019T22:02:26,MuonNeutrino,@BadFoMo yup
25-04-2019T22:02:33,BadFoMo,Huh.
25-04-2019T22:02:36,Bgrmystr2,I don't think so. Not in that respect.
25-04-2019T22:02:38,SageSaga,my stream is working
25-04-2019T22:02:41,Bgrmystr2,yeah sage
25-04-2019T22:02:43,BadFoMo,Cool.
25-04-2019T22:02:45,MarvTheHugPharaoh,\o/

25-04-2019T22:22:34,unsteddyphoenix,Thats what you eat them out of Ord
25-04-2019T22:22:35,Tharkis,why would you want vending machine sushi when you can get the freshest and best sushi on any corner? =P

25-04-2019T22:23:52,SageSaga,girls write generic love letters and put them in the vending machines - so lonely people can get one and read it
