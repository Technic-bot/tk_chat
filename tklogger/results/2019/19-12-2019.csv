19-12-2019T20:59:01,ShamusTheFox,"And with that refresher, I have questions."
19-12-2019T20:59:17,ShamusTheFox,So it was worth the lookback.

19-12-2019T21:02:30,Combak,"Hi FoMo, Shamus, Kynum."
19-12-2019T21:02:50,ShamusTheFox,"So, place your bets, place your bets...with Maren let Sythe down easy? Will she wreck his ego? Will she take him up on his offer? Will a certain squirrel intervene?"
19-12-2019T21:03:51,HoverdudeXL,yea tom is not going to stream
19-12-2019T21:03:55,NezumiYuki,Wait... Nibbly intervene?  Why?  xD   Nuuu nibs... no funny business!
19-12-2019T21:04:03,NezumiYuki,Oh?
19-12-2019T21:04:30,Kynum,I think the moment is going to be conveniently interrupted by an attack of some kind.
19-12-2019T21:04:35,ShamusTheFox,"Oh, didn't he say last week cause of Christmas? I don't fully remember."
19-12-2019T21:04:42,BadFoMo,@ShamusTheFox Will they make /another/ Half-Kind baby?!
19-12-2019T21:05:06,Combak,Is Tom even live?
19-12-2019T21:05:21,NezumiYuki,Crap... I can't remember either... i should have made a note*
19-12-2019T21:05:29,ShamusTheFox,"BadFoMo, an intriguing possibility..."
19-12-2019T21:06:02,NezumiYuki,Well I'll lurk around for awhile longer just in case the odd chance Tom does start up the stream
19-12-2019T21:06:15,ShamusTheFox,"I think Maren might turn him down at first, then find some excuse."
19-12-2019T21:06:33,Ordithus,Hello!

19-12-2019T21:13:47,Zakuru,"Tom, pro tip, wear some socks. They are underestimated and warm you up =w="
19-12-2019T21:13:56,NezumiYuki,Mihari votes coffee.  Dew it Tom!
19-12-2019T21:13:57,NezumiYuki,xD
19-12-2019T21:14:20,Mihari,Well I've been a strict water only thing for a week so... anything sounds divine XD
19-12-2019T21:14:31,Nekonny,perhaps tom could create the multi?
19-12-2019T21:14:43,SageSaga,ive been on strictly water for years now
19-12-2019T21:14:46,ShamusTheFox,Or maybe anyone could help me with Twokinds lore.
19-12-2019T21:15:06,BadFoMo,Hmm?
19-12-2019T21:15:07,MoonDance,Water very good- Stay hydrated
19-12-2019T21:15:24,Mihari,"Well, and you've also complained about it XD"
19-12-2019T21:15:28,ShamusTheFox,I was wondering...we know the identity of one of the masks. Ephemeral = Neutral. But are the other masks established?
19-12-2019T21:15:39,johnnytho,I dont think so
19-12-2019T21:16:02,sunblaze,hurgk. 3 am and I feel like crap but hey caught a Sage stream :D
19-12-2019T21:16:05,sunblaze,hi everyone
19-12-2019T21:16:10,Ordithus,hi sun
19-12-2019T21:16:12,Nekonny,heyo
19-12-2019T21:16:12,ShamusTheFox,Howdy!
19-12-2019T21:16:13,SageSaga,yo Sunblaze!
19-12-2019T21:16:36,Nekonny,hum
19-12-2019T21:16:41,MuonNeutrino,"far as i know, we haven't seen any other mask"
19-12-2019T21:16:48,Twokinds,The other two are chaos and order
19-12-2019T21:16:53,Combak,Hi Tom!
19-12-2019T21:17:06,ShamusTheFox,Ah! Neat!
19-12-2019T21:17:10,MuonNeutrino,"yeah but we don't know if they're active in the world right now, possessing anyone, etc"
19-12-2019T21:17:17,MuonNeutrino,"oh, is that what you meant shamus?"
19-12-2019T21:17:23,Zakuru,Tom should make a FAQ
19-12-2019T21:17:40,Combak,He should update the one he already has.
19-12-2019T21:17:45,ShamusTheFox,I saw one talking with Neutral after getting busted up. Seemed sinister. Was probably Chaos.
19-12-2019T21:18:01,BadFoMo,We need a Lore FAQ.
19-12-2019T21:18:08,KeefMcDerpface,Hello-ho-ho.
19-12-2019T21:18:28,NezumiYuki,"Better idea... Tom should make a TwoKinds Field Guide.  Flora... and no I don't mean just cute tiggy, but flora.. ya know.. plant life... Fauna... and artifacts... ManaCrystals etc."
19-12-2019T21:18:30,BadFoMo,...Or more for the wiki.
19-12-2019T21:18:38,Ordithus,Yeah I think that was Chaos
19-12-2019T21:18:57,BadFoMo,@NezumiYuki I could get behind that.
19-12-2019T21:19:05,ShamusTheFox,Euchre seemes to know about rules that governed a particular contest when Flora was possessed. So he clearly knows more than he lets on.
19-12-2019T21:19:21,Mihari,"Better idea, you guys pull your collective fanantic energy together make a wiki and do the info yourselves! :D"
19-12-2019T21:19:35,BadFoMo,...Ok!
19-12-2019T21:19:43,NezumiYuki,"LOL okay Speed Kitty, sounds like a plan.  xD"
19-12-2019T21:20:03,MuonNeutrino,there IS a strange hint on the characters page
19-12-2019T21:20:05,MuonNeutrino,http://twokinds.keenspot.com/characters/
19-12-2019T21:20:15,MuonNeutrino,"the shot of the master templars, the guy on the far right....."
19-12-2019T21:20:20,HoverdudeXL,wait waat
19-12-2019T21:20:29,BadFoMo,"Wait, can we creat things or must it all come from Tom?"
19-12-2019T21:20:40,HoverdudeXL,is there a sttream or no??
19-12-2019T21:20:43,KeefMcDerpface,Do they get paid by Tom to do it or is it by free choice.
19-12-2019T21:20:48,HoverdudeXL,caus ethis is confusing me
19-12-2019T21:20:58,KeefMcDerpface,"As of now Hover, no."
19-12-2019T21:21:08,MuonNeutrino,tom is around but not streaming at the moment
19-12-2019T21:21:14,HoverdudeXL,ooohhh
19-12-2019T21:21:16,HoverdudeXL,ok
19-12-2019T21:21:26,BadFoMo,I know there already is a TwoKinds Wiki.
19-12-2019T21:21:28,Nekonny,just not yet
19-12-2019T21:21:30,ShamusTheFox,Next question: Are Flora's parents actually dead? Sythe lied to Flora about Trace killing them.
19-12-2019T21:21:45,JeremySenpai,:cjeremysenpai-Yo:Sage
19-12-2019T21:21:50,KeefMcDerpface,Flora ref sheet says they are dead.
19-12-2019T21:21:54,SageSaga,yo Jeremy
19-12-2019T21:21:57,Ordithus,Hi Jeremy
19-12-2019T21:22:01,MuonNeutrino,the character sheet says her parents are dead
19-12-2019T21:22:06,MuonNeutrino,*character page
19-12-2019T21:22:13,ShamusTheFox,"Ah, gotcha gotcha."
19-12-2019T21:22:19,JeremySenpai,:cjeremysenpai-cream-lick: Ordithus
19-12-2019T21:22:20,MuonNeutrino,presumably that's accurate since it's out of universe information
19-12-2019T21:22:29,ShamusTheFox,But Trace likely wasn't the agent of their demise.
19-12-2019T21:22:40,MuonNeutrino,"However, at the age of three her home was attacked by slave traders. Her parents were killed and she was sold into slavery."
19-12-2019T21:22:44,MuonNeutrino,is what it says
19-12-2019T21:22:57,ShamusTheFox,"And Flora still believes that, because she wasn't corrected..."
19-12-2019T21:23:06,KeefMcDerpface,That's before Trace became Grand Templar.
19-12-2019T21:23:13,MuonNeutrino,"that was 8 years before the current time, which was before trace's rampage years"
19-12-2019T21:23:25,MuonNeutrino,so presumably no
19-12-2019T21:23:51,Ordithus,"Trace killed lots of parents when he was a teenager, if Sythe and Zen are to be believed.  Talk about angst"
19-12-2019T21:24:15,KeefMcDerpface,But most if not all of his anger was at the wolves.
19-12-2019T21:24:28,KeefMcDerpface,He spared Laura who was a fox.
19-12-2019T21:24:51,NezumiYuki,Trace the antagonist... I... have trouble picturing this.
19-12-2019T21:24:57,Ordithus,(Sythe and Zen lied)
19-12-2019T21:25:09,KeefMcDerpface,Evil Trace fits that Yuki.
19-12-2019T21:25:31,CrimsonHelsing,"I'd imagine we didn't see Flora figure that out, that there's no chance Trace was the one who did it. besides, I don't see the old peacekeeping mage's guild (Templar Order) aiding slavers. But I do see them not doing anything to stop it"
19-12-2019T21:25:44,ShamusTheFox,"So, Saria's Ghost...was that actually a ghost? Or just an illusion akin to Heart's Desire caused by Neutral? Cause if Saria was actually a ghost...that means Laura can manifest canonically as a ghost too (yay!)"
19-12-2019T21:26:00,MuonNeutrino,i don't know if it was ever canonically stated whether it was actually her ghost or not
19-12-2019T21:26:05,MuonNeutrino,i don't think it was
19-12-2019T21:26:08,MuonNeutrino,"stated, that is"
19-12-2019T21:26:32,CrimsonHelsing,"I think it depends on how strong a will to exist the spirit has, and sometimes certain magic can help a ghost to manifest better"
19-12-2019T21:26:36,MuonNeutrino,"i kinda do think it was actually her ghost, mostly because of the last page she appears on, talking to herself, which neutral wouldn't really do"
19-12-2019T21:26:52,KeefMcDerpface,I just reread that part and I'm question if that really was her.
19-12-2019T21:27:01,CrimsonHelsing,It was her
19-12-2019T21:27:23,CrimsonHelsing,"the Masks have magic stronger than any mortal being. that's not to say they can't be defeated, mortals clearly do find loopholes"
19-12-2019T21:27:50,ShamusTheFox,"I believe the heart's desire Laura wasn't really Laura,"
19-12-2019T21:28:18,ShamusTheFox,But it's nice to think she could 'return' for a while.
19-12-2019T21:28:20,CrimsonHelsing,"I believe it was Laura, but the heart's desire spell unintentionally caused her to manifest within the illusion"
19-12-2019T21:28:28,MuonNeutrino,the heart's desire laura is REALLY ambiguous
19-12-2019T21:28:40,MuonNeutrino,"intentionally so, i'm sure"
19-12-2019T21:30:06,KeefMcDerpface,That illusion is really interesting. I expected to be like a hologram.
19-12-2019T21:30:16,CrimsonHelsing,"well pffft, that's just my theory. wayward soul latched onto something, whether it was by accident or design, and she snapped out of her etherial stupor in a fit of anxiety and confusion"
19-12-2019T21:30:36,KeefMcDerpface,"If you try to interact with it, you go through it."
19-12-2019T21:30:42,sunblaze,I approve of this :D totally convincing costume Sage :P
19-12-2019T21:31:06,Nekonny,Checked with a few more streamers; looks like it's happening to everybody
19-12-2019T21:31:19,Nekonny,lthough I'm told thta eventually the invite goes though
19-12-2019T21:31:27,BadFoMo,Back.
19-12-2019T21:31:36,CrimsonHelsing,"of course, the spell would theoretically conflict with the memories of the soul inhabiting it, having been cast only to exist temporarily"
19-12-2019T21:31:52,SageSaga,just worked that time Ron

19-12-2019T21:58:18,Ordithus,wow
19-12-2019T21:58:29,SageSaga,why would they take anything else?
19-12-2019T21:58:35,SageSaga,nothing else in the car had any value
19-12-2019T21:58:50,IronHorseComics,I've heard of people breaking in cars to use a freaking pen
19-12-2019T21:58:58,IronHorseComics,people will take anything
19-12-2019T21:59:00,SpazztasticKiwi,if you had a mic in there maybe you had your computer in there too
19-12-2019T21:59:05,SpazztasticKiwi,or wallet
19-12-2019T21:59:07,SageSaga,well i didnt
19-12-2019T21:59:13,SageSaga,i had a 160 dollar mic though
19-12-2019T21:59:47,SpazztasticKiwi,not a big haul considering the legal charge
19-12-2019T21:59:54,Nekonny,"ok, its all set up"
19-12-2019T21:59:59,SageSaga,what charges?
19-12-2019T22:00:00,Nekonny,"oh man, sorry to hear that sage"
19-12-2019T22:00:05,SpazztasticKiwi,theft
19-12-2019T22:00:11,SpazztasticKiwi,if they broke into your car
19-12-2019T22:00:14,SageSaga,you only get charged if you get caught
19-12-2019T22:00:25,SpazztasticKiwi,still a crime
19-12-2019T22:00:28,IronHorseComics,indeed
19-12-2019T22:00:36,SpazztasticKiwi,oh speaking of which guess what
19-12-2019T22:00:41,Nekonny,I'm in the KB voicechat area if anyone wants to join in
19-12-2019T22:00:44,SageSaga,so your talking about Karma?
19-12-2019T22:00:50,Sclimshady,"But you live a life knowing what you did,  constantly haunting you"
19-12-2019T22:00:54,IronHorseComics,I've got a funny story actually
19-12-2019T22:00:59,JeremySenpai,*little know fact. In australia you can be charged for leaving your car unlocked when paying for fuel.
19-12-2019T22:01:20,SpazztasticKiwi,we have a squatter camper that’s been staying in our parking lot
19-12-2019T22:01:20,SageSaga,because they got away with a 160 dollar mic thats easy to sell- and didnt get caught at all
19-12-2019T22:02:09,JeremySenpai,brb gonna make hamburger
19-12-2019T22:02:14,SpazztasticKiwi,nothing says sweet nights sleep or fun day away like spending the night in walmart parking lot
19-12-2019T22:02:17,SageSaga,and Tom sent me one of Marks old mics that was the exact same kind I had
19-12-2019T22:02:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Mark’s been through so many mics
19-12-2019T22:02:42,Nekonny,after or before
19-12-2019T22:02:48,IronHorseComics,"so one time, some years ago, I was at the big used book store place I often go to. Well, when I get there that particular day there were a couple of cop cars there flashing their lights..."
19-12-2019T22:02:50,Nekonny,or was that the one that got stolen?
19-12-2019T22:02:55,SageSaga,after obviously
19-12-2019T22:03:07,LannAF,yowdy and howdy!
19-12-2019T22:03:11,SpazztasticKiwi,ew
19-12-2019T22:03:18,SageSaga,why would he send me one to replace it if it hadnt been stolen yet?
19-12-2019T22:03:21,Sclimshady,HI LANNNNNN
19-12-2019T22:03:21,Ordithus,Hi Lann!

19-12-2019T22:03:30,LannAF,"HI SCLIMMM, Hi Ordithus!"
19-12-2019T22:03:32,Sclimshady,Happy early birfday!

19-12-2019T22:03:41,LannAF,Happy unbirthday to you!
19-12-2019T22:03:47,SageSaga,Blue Yeti
19-12-2019T22:03:48,Sclimshady,Why thank you
19-12-2019T22:03:55,SpazztasticKiwi,ah
19-12-2019T22:03:57,SpazztasticKiwi,that one
19-12-2019T22:04:07,IronHorseComics,"I think ""huh, that's odd, what's going on here?"" and I ask somebody and they said some moron got busted for stealing an Ipod. Turns out he had stolen it from one of the employees of the book store"
19-12-2019T22:04:13,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t know why but Mark has a sudden hate for those now
19-12-2019T22:04:18,Nekonny,"well, the other one coudld have broken"
19-12-2019T22:04:36,IronHorseComics,and he was only under suspicion to begin with for being illegally parked in a handicapped spot
19-12-2019T22:04:42,Nekonny,"sorry, I just wasn't following the storry too closely because arts"
19-12-2019T22:04:45,SageSaga,you just werent reading what i said then Ron
19-12-2019T22:04:56,Nekonny,^
19-12-2019T22:05:12,SpazztasticKiwi,I remember at mcdonalds once a girl noticed her apple charger had gone missing behind the counter and come to find out some customers had swiped it
19-12-2019T22:05:28,SpazztasticKiwi,called the cops and they gave it right back when threatened with charges
19-12-2019T22:06:14,Nekonny,"""that call cost taxpayers more than the burger"""
19-12-2019T22:06:41,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s not far to the police station to mcdonalds here
19-12-2019T22:07:25,Nekonny,I said it as a joke
19-12-2019T22:07:56,SageSaga,also that doesnt mean it doesnt still cost more than a burger
19-12-2019T22:08:21,SpazztasticKiwi,walmart security evidently called the cops today to get the camper expelled
19-12-2019T22:08:26,Nekonny,"well, it's not like cops charge per call"
19-12-2019T22:08:37,SpazztasticKiwi,they like to stay overnight and throw trash in the lot
19-12-2019T22:08:40,Kynum,"Yeah. At that point, it would cost AT LEAST a mcflurry on top of a burger."
19-12-2019T22:08:42,IronHorseComics,unless it's the world of Robocop
19-12-2019T22:08:43,Nekonny,they're on the clock anyway
19-12-2019T22:08:51,SpazztasticKiwi,admittedly the cops round her don’t have much to do
19-12-2019T22:09:27,SageSaga,"""Because of our response to your call  15 kids are dead, so happy you got your phone charger back?"""
19-12-2019T22:09:40,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s more than that
19-12-2019T22:09:51,Nekonny,that escalated quickly
19-12-2019T22:09:52,SageSaga,wat
19-12-2019T22:09:58,Nekonny,forgets he's on voice
19-12-2019T22:10:01,Nekonny,all alomne
19-12-2019T22:10:21,SpazztasticKiwi,they can arrest people who reach across the counter like they did to grab the charger
19-12-2019T22:10:55,SageSaga,with what?
19-12-2019T22:10:59,IronHorseComics,there's noone there besides yooouuuu
19-12-2019T22:11:07,ZRO4825,"Yup, the moment you cross from the customer area into the employee area, it can be considered trespassing I believe."
19-12-2019T22:11:10,SpazztasticKiwi,attempted robbery
19-12-2019T22:11:16,SpazztasticKiwi,and trespassing
19-12-2019T22:11:28,SpazztasticKiwi,or assault if the owners really sour
19-12-2019T22:11:55,SpazztasticKiwi,over the counter is considered “register” territory
19-12-2019T22:12:23,SageSaga,good luck getting a judge to agree with that
19-12-2019T22:12:32,SpazztasticKiwi,they do
19-12-2019T22:12:50,SpazztasticKiwi,besides they took property anyway
19-12-2019T22:12:50,IronHorseComics,they must be really bored to do so
19-12-2019T22:13:14,SpazztasticKiwi,little thefts are still thefts
19-12-2019T22:13:15,SageSaga,yeah i call bullcrap- source needed
19-12-2019T22:13:37,Nekonny,bullcrap has been called
19-12-2019T22:14:16,Ordithus,shenanigans has done been declared
19-12-2019T22:14:20,sunblaze,it is of course possible to sue the thief sure. the owner of that charger could
19-12-2019T22:14:42,Nekonny,:ox::poop::telephone_receiver:
19-12-2019T22:14:54,sunblaze,but arrest them? more like take their ID and let the juristical process do the rest
19-12-2019T22:15:08,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s mainly because of so many customers grabbing employees cause they don’t get their way
19-12-2019T22:15:42,SpazztasticKiwi,but the other half is the owner of our mcdonalds has a stick the size of Texas up his as
19-12-2019T22:16:17,SpazztasticKiwi,he’s been said to threaten employees with theft for using a cup for a drink
19-12-2019T22:16:41,SageSaga,yeah most judges will throw that out
19-12-2019T22:16:45,Ordithus,seems like a real nice guy :csagesaga-nynastare:
19-12-2019T22:17:51,JeremySenpai,noms burger
19-12-2019T22:17:58,JeremySenpai,I have had bosses like that
19-12-2019T22:18:18,SageSaga,lot of judges dont like frivolous suits that muck up their job stopping them from doing important work
19-12-2019T22:18:56,SageSaga,so if he tried to press charges- pretty much if you go to court you'll walk
19-12-2019T22:18:59,Nekonny,thats what judge judy is for
19-12-2019T22:19:39,SpazztasticKiwi,hes really just a generally cheap bastard
19-12-2019T22:19:51,SpazztasticKiwi,despite owning like 3 stores
19-12-2019T22:20:12,Nekonny,are the verdicts on those kind of shows actually enforceable?
19-12-2019T22:20:32,SageSaga,yeah so was my old boss and he owned the only hotel on a beach in a historical district
19-12-2019T22:20:40,Ordithus,"they are an arbitration court, so yeah"
19-12-2019T22:21:30,Nekonny,I don't remember thta beach too well
19-12-2019T22:21:37,Nekonny,I remember the heater worked
19-12-2019T22:21:42,SageSaga,you cant use arbitration court for a criminal dispute though right?
19-12-2019T22:21:53,Ordithus,"not for criminal, has to be civil"
19-12-2019T22:21:56,Nekonny,good point
19-12-2019T22:22:17,Sclimshady,Is civil court ever that?
19-12-2019T22:22:37,SageSaga,so yeah its a hollow threat to charge an employee for use of a cup
19-12-2019T22:22:47,Ordithus,(not a lawyer or practiced in law)
19-12-2019T22:23:04,sunblaze,in the US maybe
19-12-2019T22:23:23,Nekonny,joins the kemono cafe discord voicechat
19-12-2019T22:23:28,sunblaze,"it happened with like stealing 1 piece of 1,5$ candy before"
19-12-2019T22:23:47,sunblaze,or taking leftovers from a restaurant with you home
19-12-2019T22:23:54,Ordithus,wait wat
19-12-2019T22:24:21,sunblaze,^those 2 were extrem cases but both lsot their job
19-12-2019T22:24:51,Nekonny,it was just an excuse to get rid of employees he didn't like
19-12-2019T22:25:02,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-rose::wine_glass:
19-12-2019T22:25:02,sunblaze,of course. sadly the judge agreed
19-12-2019T22:25:21,SageSaga,my friends that work at a local restaurant pack up any food at the end of the night to give to the employees that have families or trouble with getting food
19-12-2019T22:25:54,sunblaze,^thats a nice gift :)
19-12-2019T22:25:58,Ordithus,that is awesome of them
19-12-2019T22:26:10,SpazztasticKiwi,what we need is a soup kitchen to take all the waste
19-12-2019T22:26:49,SpazztasticKiwi,"once, we had a whole truck of produce come in under the approved  temperature"
19-12-2019T22:26:51,Ordithus,Rieko and Nyna are often paired up in these
19-12-2019T22:26:56,SpazztasticKiwi,thrown out

19-12-2019T22:27:24,Ordithus,someone is a fan of nekomata
19-12-2019T22:27:46,SageSaga,Ron- they do pay well too but those people cant generally work enough hours
19-12-2019T22:28:06,Nekonny,ah
19-12-2019T22:28:58,Nekonny,clarify; they cant work a full time schedule or they arent given a full time schedule?
19-12-2019T22:29:07,SpazztasticKiwi,"thing is, even after they went over with everyone that we had to but"
19-12-2019T22:29:21,SpazztasticKiwi,buy a drink if we had a cup
19-12-2019T22:29:29,unsteddyphoenix,No pants!
19-12-2019T22:29:36,SageSaga,they cant work full time because their family has special needs
19-12-2019T22:29:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"and not take it home, I kept doing it"
19-12-2019T22:29:51,Nekonny,"ok, now I uderstand"

19-12-2019T22:38:07,SpazztasticKiwi,it works when the stars are in the right alignment
19-12-2019T22:38:13,Mihari,I really want to replace this consumer grade router with an enterprise one.

19-12-2019T23:01:34,SageSaga,practically all of it is voice acted- fantastic story- great game
19-12-2019T23:01:54,IronHorseComics,Knights of the Old Republic

19-12-2019T23:05:21,IronHorseComics,World of Warships is a lot nicer about the grind than WoT
19-12-2019T23:05:31,IronHorseComics,it's a lot more rewarding

19-12-2019T23:08:07,Tharkis,o/ chalo
19-12-2019T23:08:08,SageSaga,Iceborne adds 2 player and 3 player scaling
19-12-2019T23:08:26,SageSaga,but Standard MH and MHW only has solo and 4 player
19-12-2019T23:08:51,TheFreindlyDeathclaw,i am playing Assassins Creed Odyssey
19-12-2019T23:09:57,SageSaga,MHW is not an MMO
19-12-2019T23:10:05,SageSaga,its a Co-op

19-12-2019T23:14:06,Mihari,"They have asynchronous servers that basically communications between each player to keep them in sync, but that's about it."

19-12-2019T23:37:25,Mihari,"It is as big as that Katbox was, it's just a matter of when :P"
19-12-2019T23:38:20,Mihari,How do I have more time in MHW than you? O_o
19-12-2019T23:38:36,SageSaga,i dunno - did you leave it on over night?
19-12-2019T23:38:49,Mihari,Maybe once... but .... XD
19-12-2019T23:39:06,Mihari,639 hours
19-12-2019T23:39:23,Mihari,All that Kulve farming maybe? XD
19-12-2019T23:39:25,ZRO4825,"Only got 226 hours on PC, but I think my PS4 file was around 500 hours before Iceborn launched."
19-12-2019T23:39:33,SageSaga,I thought i fought Kulve more than you
19-12-2019T23:39:53,Nekonny,I think this one is doen
19-12-2019T23:39:54,AspiringNoodle,500 hours. *laughs in WoW*
19-12-2019T23:39:58,Dadrobit,Howdy y'all!

19-12-2019T23:40:26,SageSaga,my total time was 900 hours
19-12-2019T23:40:28,ZRO4825,laughs in FFXI.
19-12-2019T23:40:35,AspiringNoodle,That thing is a dumpster fire in a volcano that's erupting
19-12-2019T23:40:36,TheFreindlyDeathclaw,so adorable Nekon

19-12-2019T23:40:52,maku450,adorable :3
19-12-2019T23:41:09,Mihari,Well if I was crazy super fan and bought it on the PS4 too... yah...
19-12-2019T23:41:30,SageSaga,yep - i bought a PS4 Pro and 5 copies of MHW
19-12-2019T23:41:48,SageSaga,and 3 copies of Iceborne
19-12-2019T23:42:04,Mihari,Maybe your combined all MH games can beat my STO time! :D
19-12-2019T23:42:18,Dadrobit,">.> Man, I miss playing MHW now... Stopped playing after the Witcher event. Just couldn't find the time anymore..."
19-12-2019T23:42:50,SageSaga,close- 300+ hours of MH4U and i think 290 for Gen and about 100 in Gen Ult
19-12-2019T23:42:56,Nekonny,5 copies.... ?
19-12-2019T23:43:07,Mihari,3.8k :D
19-12-2019T23:43:29,SageSaga,"yep- One PS4 copy for me- one for my brother, one PC copy, one PC copy for -- oh my- i bought more than 5"
19-12-2019T23:44:05,SageSaga,"and then Iceborne for Myself, Mihari and Silver-"
19-12-2019T23:44:59,SageSaga,Ron...
19-12-2019T23:45:04,SageSaga,you are bad at this
19-12-2019T23:45:11,Mihari,Ask Sage how big RD2 is...
19-12-2019T23:45:22,SageSaga,RD2 IS OVER 100GBS!
19-12-2019T23:46:13,SageSaga,Ron- no...
19-12-2019T23:46:14,Fortes,"neko, this is a very cute squirrel you have made :V"
19-12-2019T23:46:27,SageSaga,so many things are fully voice acted now- that alone is HUGE
19-12-2019T23:46:48,SageSaga,4k Textures are HUGE
19-12-2019T23:47:26,TheFreindlyDeathclaw,I wish Fallout 76 was better
19-12-2019T23:48:28,SageSaga,no
19-12-2019T23:48:41,SageSaga,see you dont understand computer games
19-12-2019T23:49:48,unsteddyphoenix,Thats where you went wrong!
19-12-2019T23:50:59,Nekonny,haunts
19-12-2019T23:51:03,SageSaga,you should know that you need to have higher resolution textures for higher resolution displays- but just because a display isnt higher resolution doesnt mean a texture cant look better if it is higher res
19-12-2019T23:51:06,Nekonny,XD
19-12-2019T23:52:15,ZRO4825,Example: Skyrim mods. :joy:
19-12-2019T23:53:22,SageSaga,also a texture of a low resolution should look fine if you always only see it at the correct distance for it to appear that resolution
19-12-2019T23:53:42,SageSaga,unfortunately for them cameras move and you can get way closer and see that something is low res-
19-12-2019T23:55:25,SageSaga,that doesnt make sense unless i heard you wrong
19-12-2019T23:55:29,Mihari,My one arguement for high res files is if I'm going to display them in a 4k display the higher the better.
19-12-2019T23:56:16,Mihari,a 1080p image will look 'fine' but it would look better if not great if it's native sized or higher.
19-12-2019T23:56:16,SageSaga,there's huge benefits to having them higher res than display regardless of the display
19-12-2019T23:56:44,SageSaga,native size can change meaning when you have a camera in a 3D space
19-12-2019T23:56:58,SageSaga,that LOD
19-12-2019T23:57:03,SageSaga,that's*
19-12-2019T23:57:19,AspiringNoodle,Inb4 vector graphics takeover :P
19-12-2019T23:57:54,SageSaga,LOD is Level Of Detail- but none of that helps with FILE SIZE because you need BOTH files low res and high to work
19-12-2019T23:59:19,Mihari,"Almost all of that has changed now that the hardware we have can do more thus they push more at it, and in most cases unless they go into the 4-8k realms."
19-12-2019T23:59:44,Mihari,The latter being kinda silly IMO
