31-08-2019T00:20:19,SpazztasticKiwi,these guys at the hospital with their friend cause he‚Äôs had a diabetic attack and they‚Äôre playing In the Arms of the Angels while they wait for him to be stabilized and released
31-08-2019T00:20:21,SpazztasticKiwi,boys
31-08-2019T00:21:15,SpazztasticKiwi,everyone giggling away and horsing around while the guys in the bed like ‚Äúyep these are my friends‚Äù
31-08-2019T00:50:29,Dadrobit,"Hey Noodle, just a heads up, get used to covering for no-call no-shows in retail and service gigs. Your store will always be short staffed, and there will always be overtime."
31-08-2019T00:59:14,AspiringNoodle,That was a nice nap
31-08-2019T01:05:57,SpazztasticKiwi,is there any good reaction to seeing a kid standing up in a shop cart acting up
31-08-2019T01:05:59,AspiringNoodle,It's amazing retail has survived for so long
31-08-2019T01:14:11,SpazztasticKiwi,we supposedly got a new guy
31-08-2019T01:14:16,SpazztasticKiwi,yet to see him
31-08-2019T01:48:11,Dadrobit,"Retail isn't going away any time soon. Low wage workers in automate-able positions, yes."
31-08-2019T02:01:10,AspiringNoodle,"Retail might change in the future, though"
31-08-2019T02:01:21,AspiringNoodle,Supposedly worker exploitation is increasing
31-08-2019T02:02:21,AspiringNoodle,"ah well, I'm gonna work to get out of retail now :3"
31-08-2019T02:03:53,AspiringNoodle,...do gas stations count as retail / service?
31-08-2019T02:29:53,FreedomCrusader,yes they do

31-08-2019T12:03:57,Dadrobit,Patreon declined my auto-pay because I got a new card. Old one was buggered and the chip stopped working all the time.

31-08-2019T22:07:39,Dadrobit,But I'm*
31-08-2019T22:08:10,Dadrobit,Corgis are the exception to the rule. Those motherfuckers are adorable.
31-08-2019T22:08:14,unsteddyphoenix,Agree on all points
31-08-2019T22:09:16,Ordithus,corgis ARE adorable
31-08-2019T22:10:28,Dadrobit,"Also, can I just mention. Online college textbook rentals are complete ass. I paid $50 for a digital rental of a book that I currently can't fuckin' access because my internet is going in and out with the storm right now."
31-08-2019T22:11:48,Ordithus,"What's next, textbook dlc?"
31-08-2019T22:11:50,Dadrobit,"And because the site it is rented from auto-updates itself to verify my credentials every few minutes, I can't even have the luxury of pulling it up in a tab and leaving in on a page."
31-08-2019T22:12:03,Dadrobit,That's literally a thing already dude.
31-08-2019T22:12:12,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-zenshocked:
31-08-2019T22:12:31,Dadrobit,"The odd numbered answers in math textbooks are given, to get the even answers you have to pay extra."
31-08-2019T22:13:23,unsteddyphoenix,Hahaha that's so ridiculous
31-08-2019T22:13:47,Ordithus,at least that is providing something that used to not even be offered to students at all
31-08-2019T22:14:18,Ordithus,but still... wtf
31-08-2019T22:14:26,Dadrobit,"I remember my applied mathematics textbook was $300+ with taxes. And here's the kicker, there were even incorrect answers in the answer key. These motherfuckers can't even be assed to do their own work right."
31-08-2019T22:14:48,Ordithus,That's just tradition
31-08-2019T22:15:54,Ordithus,I still really love my U's book rental program
31-08-2019T22:16:02,Dadrobit,"I remember bringing it up to the professor and even he was like, ""these dumb motherfuckers..."""
31-08-2019T22:16:06,Ordithus,It was like $50 to rent all the textbooks for a semester
31-08-2019T22:17:59,Dadrobit,Mildly envious over here. $50 gets me 190 days for one book.
31-08-2019T22:20:53,Dadrobit,"And I swear to God, half of this book is just stock photos of people doing random shit. Like, they just filled the pages with this stuff and the actual text in the textbook is relegated to small blurbs under the pictures."
31-08-2019T22:21:14,Dadrobit,"I'd take a screenshot but... Oh yeah, I can't fuckin'access it!"
31-08-2019T22:22:04,Ordithus,that all is very shit.  good luck...

31-08-2019T22:30:17,AspiringNoodle,It has shown me that I would rather use my degree and get a programming job that I may not entirely like
31-08-2019T22:30:44,AspiringNoodle,"That said, time to start looking for postings and get to work on some skillshare courses to shake off the rust xD"

31-08-2019T23:06:30,RimaDraws,i am actually okay with this because i need to write one page speeches like about 5 or 6
31-08-2019T23:06:44,RimaDraws,thats all i have left. everything else is already made
31-08-2019T23:06:52,RimaDraws,oh i hope they are okay
31-08-2019T23:06:54,CrRAR,Yeah the 22nd is already a while ago. Most colleges around here are just getting started.
31-08-2019T23:06:55,SpazztasticKiwi,two have died since - one was the lil brother of a guy I graduated with
31-08-2019T23:07:08,SpazztasticKiwi,three are in hospital
31-08-2019T23:07:17,CrRAR,Dang
31-08-2019T23:07:23,Ordithus,wow...
31-08-2019T23:07:26,RimaDraws,my college is diff. its the same as any university but this is a faster program about 18months
31-08-2019T23:07:29,RimaDraws,god dang...
31-08-2019T23:07:45,CrRAR,"Well like you said none wearing seatbelts, standing up in a Jeep."
31-08-2019T23:07:50,SpazztasticKiwi,yep
31-08-2019T23:08:07,RimaDraws,so the courses are six weeks each and there are four per semester which there are three so 12 courses.
31-08-2019T23:08:12,SpazztasticKiwi,19 year olds doing things they shouldn‚Äôt
31-08-2019T23:08:16,CrRAR,Driver's a loser jerk though.
31-08-2019T23:08:26,RimaDraws,i really am sorry kiwi. sucks they were killed in that wreck
31-08-2019T23:08:47,SpazztasticKiwi,I only knew the brother and even with him I wasn‚Äôt close
31-08-2019T23:09:15,SpazztasticKiwi,I showed for the vigil tonight cause I won‚Äôt make the funeral
31-08-2019T23:09:23,RimaDraws,that reminds me of the girl i didnt like in middle school. she didnt make it to freshmen year because she was in a car accident and died
31-08-2019T23:10:00,RimaDraws,thats nice of you to go. i am sure they would appreciate it
31-08-2019T23:10:17,SpazztasticKiwi,the brother tho looked ok - didn‚Äôt look real upset at all
31-08-2019T23:10:20,Ordithus,hope the others in the hospital recover
31-08-2019T23:10:38,SpazztasticKiwi,I imagine it may could be it hasn‚Äôt hit him yet
31-08-2019T23:11:25,SpazztasticKiwi,just kinda feel egh myself
31-08-2019T23:11:30,CrRAR,Those that survive can get some dang good settlement money.
31-08-2019T23:11:50,CrRAR,"Well, the families of the deceased too."
31-08-2019T23:12:05,RimaDraws,yea if it hasnt hit him now it definitely will later....hate to say it. a loss like that is a shock
31-08-2019T23:12:05,SpazztasticKiwi,it was a single wreck
31-08-2019T23:12:26,CrRAR,That kids whole family probably gonna lose their house.
31-08-2019T23:12:27,SpazztasticKiwi,their target was a light pole
31-08-2019T23:12:39,Ordithus,wait what
31-08-2019T23:13:30,CrRAR,The driver was clearly driving irresponsibly right?
31-08-2019T23:14:09,CrRAR,Was he drunk? Did he flee the scene or anything?
31-08-2019T23:14:10,SpazztasticKiwi,I guess - they wenr into the pole somehow
31-08-2019T23:14:30,CrRAR,Yeah
31-08-2019T23:14:37,SpazztasticKiwi,not all the details were out there but I don‚Äôt see alcohol in it
31-08-2019T23:15:06,SpazztasticKiwi,one of the boys that died - the brother of the boy I know - father was a cop
31-08-2019T23:15:35,SpazztasticKiwi,underage drinking doesn‚Äôt seem like a possibility for the equation
31-08-2019T23:15:43,CrRAR,Ah
31-08-2019T23:16:34,SpazztasticKiwi,feel bad for it all but....you know
31-08-2019T23:16:37,CrRAR,"Oh but yeah, the driver kid's insurance will get claims for bodily injury, the victims can get money w/ no other car involved."
31-08-2019T23:16:52,SpazztasticKiwi,is that REALLY important rn?
31-08-2019T23:16:54,CrRAR,How much depends on his policy.
31-08-2019T23:17:06,SpazztasticKiwi,kids died
31-08-2019T23:17:13,CrRAR,"No, but for the injured, yes for medical bills."
31-08-2019T23:17:20,Ordithus,did this happen in June?
31-08-2019T23:17:28,SpazztasticKiwi,this happened Friday
31-08-2019T23:17:30,CrRAR,"My brother went through the same thing, sucks."
31-08-2019T23:17:51,CrRAR,He was an occupant.
31-08-2019T23:18:36,SpazztasticKiwi,they‚Äôre doing a collection thing for expenses; the boys were friends
31-08-2019T23:18:58,CrRAR,"Aww, nice."
31-08-2019T23:19:11,SpazztasticKiwi,families knew each other at least
