28-01-2019T11:56:01,iliar,Good.
28-01-2019T11:57:11,iliar,"Tom, once you said that Nora Card can be used for remake pages. Can I use Nora Card for remaking Trace and Saria wedding? http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/406/"
28-01-2019T11:57:45,Twokinds,"Oh, uh..."
28-01-2019T11:58:23,Twokinds,"I dunno, I suppose so."
28-01-2019T11:58:34,Twokinds,"Though I think that page still holds up pretty well, honestly."
28-01-2019T11:58:46,Twokinds,I think it's one of my best early pages.
28-01-2019T11:58:51,Twokinds,If I'm honest.
28-01-2019T11:59:13,Twokinds,Hard to believe it's from 2007.
28-01-2019T11:59:48,Twokinds,I remember drawing these pages.
28-01-2019T12:00:08,iliar,"Yes, this page is pretty good."
28-01-2019T12:01:40,Azumachan,A whole page or just a panel ?
28-01-2019T12:02:23,Twokinds,A whole page is way too much work
28-01-2019T12:02:43,iliar,"I did not want to say ""this page is bad and you have to redo it."" I just want beautiful art with Saria. And I think second frame nice reference."
28-01-2019T12:03:01,Azumachan,Indeed.
28-01-2019T12:03:10,Mippy,"Yeah, it’s a pretty great early panel."
28-01-2019T12:03:10,Twokinds,"I know. I could do, though I wouldn't be the most excited to work on it."
28-01-2019T12:03:16,Azumachan,Don't kill Tom Iliar !
28-01-2019T12:03:25,Mippy,Hello 👋
28-01-2019T12:03:38,Azumachan,Hey
28-01-2019T12:04:59,iliar,"Okay, then."
28-01-2019T12:06:52,Azumachan,What would be exciting to draw ?
28-01-2019T12:09:38,iliar,I'm pretty sure that Tom will not answer this question.
28-01-2019T12:10:53,Azumachan,Shrugs
28-01-2019T12:12:22,Azumachan,How's going Iliar ?
28-01-2019T12:15:30,iliar,"Because Tom realizes that if he answers, ""I would like to color XXX"", I can Nora Carded it."
28-01-2019T12:16:59,Azumachan,Isn't that a win win if you like it too ?
28-01-2019T12:17:51,iliar,"All is well. As usual there is not enough time for everything that I want to do. I'm sure Amazon should sell ""Time"". I would buy a few boxes."
28-01-2019T12:21:40,Twokinds,I'd love that
28-01-2019T12:21:48,Twokinds,I would buy as much as I could afford
28-01-2019T12:21:59,Azumachan,^
28-01-2019T12:23:05,Twokinds,"If I could have one magic item, it would be a timeless pocket dimension I could go in to work as much as I want. XD"
28-01-2019T12:24:38,Azumachan,A tardis ?
28-01-2019T12:27:17,TerraTheWizard,you still age when you're in the tardis
28-01-2019T12:27:41,iliar,"Use timeless pocket dimension for work... is... There is one book called ""Monday Begins on Saturday"". People loved their work so much in it that they came to work on weekends too. Just for fun."

28-01-2019T13:20:09,RimaDraws,That’s good tom
28-01-2019T13:20:18,CrimsonQuill,It's a bit chilly over here....
28-01-2019T13:20:25,CrimsonQuill,"I have hot chocolate in a flask,"
28-01-2019T13:20:29,CrimsonQuill,And a biscuit.
28-01-2019T13:20:30,RimaDraws,Well business is booming with commissions now. Also yes cold here
28-01-2019T13:20:46,CrimsonQuill,"Heh, wooly jumper weather, isn't it?"
28-01-2019T13:21:29,RimaDraws,If you mean I need my hoodie yes
28-01-2019T13:21:53,CrimsonQuill,Weeeeelll...I actually meant the fact that I have more jumpers than I know what to do with.
28-01-2019T13:22:07,CrimsonQuill,Including no less than FIVE ARAN ISLAND JUMPERS.
28-01-2019T13:23:03,CrimsonQuill,"For the uninformed, they're jumpers made in the style of people living on the Aran islands, off the coast of Galway/Clare."
28-01-2019T13:23:13,CrimsonQuill,They're worn in Donegal too.
28-01-2019T13:23:16,CrimsonQuill,Really warm.
28-01-2019T13:23:17,RimaDraws,Oh well okay
28-01-2019T13:23:32,CrimsonQuill,A hoodie's not quite warm enough for me...
28-01-2019T13:23:40,CrimsonQuill,How many jumpers do you think Tom has?
28-01-2019T13:26:27,RimaDraws,Not sure
28-01-2019T13:26:34,CrimsonQuill,I'll ask him.
28-01-2019T13:26:45,CrimsonQuill,"Tom, how many jumpers do you think you have?"
28-01-2019T13:26:57,TerraTheWizard,why is it when i'm at my pc it's quiet here
28-01-2019T13:27:03,TerraTheWizard,but when i step away people start talking
28-01-2019T13:27:20,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-flomad:
28-01-2019T13:27:26,CrimsonQuill,"I don't know, Terra, it happens to me too."
28-01-2019T13:27:38,CrimsonQuill,OH. OH.
28-01-2019T13:27:43,RimaDraws,Terra ❤️❤️
28-01-2019T13:27:50,CrimsonQuill,Just remembered.
28-01-2019T13:27:58,CrimsonQuill,"Also, obligatory Nibbly"
28-01-2019T13:28:03,CrimsonQuill,:ctwokinds-nibsbounce:
28-01-2019T13:28:08,CrimsonQuill,Three bags.
28-01-2019T13:28:10,RimaDraws,I must scoot. Nice talking to you all on lunch
28-01-2019T13:28:16,CrimsonQuill,Bye Rima
28-01-2019T13:28:31,TerraTheWizard,o/
28-01-2019T13:28:45,CrimsonQuill,"On Sunday, I had three really heavy bags, and had to walk with them for twenty minutes."
28-01-2019T13:28:56,CrimsonQuill,"I packed them poorly, so they really weighed me down."
28-01-2019T13:29:03,CrimsonQuill,I'm drawing a picture of it.
28-01-2019T13:29:27,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
28-01-2019T13:29:37,CrimsonQuill,"I'm calling it ""Everything but the kitchen sink""...and then someone'll say, ""Oi, you forgot this!"" and throw the kitchen sink at me."
28-01-2019T13:29:45,CrimsonQuill,I felt like I just have to draw it.
28-01-2019T13:30:04,CrimsonQuill,It's something fun to do-a neat way to laugh at my own idiocy.
28-01-2019T13:30:49,TerraTheWizard,i think i've missed something here
28-01-2019T13:31:15,CrimsonQuill,Oh.
28-01-2019T13:31:18,CrimsonQuill,Ok
28-01-2019T13:31:36,CrimsonQuill,"Well, on Sunday, I had to walk 20 minutes with three bags I'd packed."
28-01-2019T13:31:42,CrimsonQuill,"As usual, I'd packed too much."
28-01-2019T13:31:56,CrimsonQuill,"Only this time, to the Nth degree."
28-01-2019T13:32:08,TerraTheWizard,ohh
28-01-2019T13:32:18,CrimsonQuill,"So I was basically stooped over, lurching for 20 minutes till I got to where I was going."
28-01-2019T13:32:20,TerraTheWizard,"ok, i see what message i missed now"
28-01-2019T13:32:28,CrimsonQuill,And now I'm caricaturising myself in it.
28-01-2019T13:32:55,CrimsonQuill,Hmmm...maybe I should ban myself from video games forever...
28-01-2019T13:33:13,CrimsonQuill,Then I'd...still procrastinate on the net. Bother
28-01-2019T13:33:30,CrimsonQuill,"Oh well, I'm watching LOtR tonight."
28-01-2019T13:33:34,CrimsonQuill,So there's that.
28-01-2019T13:35:53,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-KeithNeat:
28-01-2019T13:36:20,CrimsonQuill,And hot chocolate in a flask.
28-01-2019T13:36:33,CrimsonQuill,There's always room for a hot drink in a flask.
28-01-2019T13:37:01,TerraTheWizard,well picarto fixed the mislisted subscripion prices
28-01-2019T13:37:14,CrimsonQuill,'Mislisted'
28-01-2019T13:37:17,CrimsonQuill,?
28-01-2019T13:37:27,TerraTheWizard,the 6 months sub had the price for 12 months
28-01-2019T13:37:37,CrimsonQuill,Oh.
28-01-2019T13:37:53,CrimsonQuill,"Just looking at them now, and boy, it's expensive..."
28-01-2019T13:37:56,TerraTheWizard,they fixed the price on 6 months & added a 12 month
28-01-2019T13:37:57,CrimsonQuill,for a year that is
28-01-2019T13:38:06,Dadrobit,Hot tip for anyone picking up Kingdom Hearts 3.
28-01-2019T13:38:12,Dadrobit,Play on Proud Mode.
28-01-2019T13:38:29,CrimsonQuill,I can't pick up Kingdom Hearts 3.
28-01-2019T13:38:34,CrimsonQuill,So shame...
28-01-2019T13:38:46,TerraTheWizard,KH not my kinda thing
28-01-2019T13:38:48,Dadrobit,"The game gives you so many quick time events and power ups, normal has very little challenge honestly."
28-01-2019T13:39:17,TerraTheWizard,"went to watch a stream earlier, over half of the channels i follow were playing kh3"
28-01-2019T13:39:19,CrimsonQuill,My best friend advises me to play on higher difficulties in video games.
28-01-2019T13:39:42,CrimsonQuill,"So, I play Halo on Heroic or Legendary exclusively..."
28-01-2019T13:39:47,CrimsonQuill,Skyrim on Adept...
28-01-2019T13:39:49,TerraTheWizard,depends what you want out of the game though
28-01-2019T13:40:01,CrimsonQuill,I'm in for the story and the challenge.
28-01-2019T13:40:11,TerraTheWizard,you can game skyrim enough that legendary is easy peasy
28-01-2019T13:40:11,TerraTheWizard,lol
28-01-2019T13:40:12,CrimsonQuill,Unlike one of my sisters...
28-01-2019T13:40:28,CrimsonQuill,Who spawned 1000 chickens and a Dragon in Markarth.
28-01-2019T13:40:39,CrimsonQuill,She's said she's ignoring the main story entirely.
28-01-2019T13:40:43,TerraTheWizard,player.placeatme f 100000
28-01-2019T13:40:57,CrimsonQuill,I'm not using cheats either.
28-01-2019T13:41:00,TerraTheWizard,i did that command once
28-01-2019T13:41:04,TerraTheWizard,my pc wasn't happy
28-01-2019T13:41:07,CrimsonQuill,LOL
28-01-2019T13:41:13,CrimsonQuill,Mine'd probably lag too.
28-01-2019T13:41:25,TerraTheWizard,"well, it was fine after about 30 seconds"
28-01-2019T13:41:35,CrimsonQuill,I asked my friend how big the explosion of my laptop would be if I tried playing Arma 3.
28-01-2019T13:41:39,TerraTheWizard,but it didn't like trying to figure out the physics of 100k gold coins
28-01-2019T13:41:49,CrimsonQuill,"His response was ""Supernova""."
28-01-2019T13:42:00,CrimsonQuill,It's funny how the world of Skyrim works.
28-01-2019T13:42:19,CrimsonQuill,"I like to leave the giants and mammoths alone, though."
28-01-2019T13:42:23,CrimsonQuill,They're cool.

28-01-2019T13:49:11,Dadrobit,It took me some time to git gud. Bloodborne was my first. Took me literaly something like 2 hours to get past the first street with 20 dudes.
28-01-2019T13:49:21,Dadrobit,Now that shit is my jam
28-01-2019T13:49:28,CrimsonQuill,"Just today, the game broke."
28-01-2019T13:50:02,CrimsonQuill,"I was given a mission, but it then listed as 'completed' before I did it..so I had to load a save that left a lot of progress lost."
28-01-2019T13:56:36,CrimsonQuill,Not fun.

28-01-2019T14:16:45,CrimsonQuill,It's always a bit odd seeing them in real life.
28-01-2019T14:31:28,Xexanoth,...it's always surprising how often you hear that sentence...

28-01-2019T14:49:36,CrimsonQuill,I think my favourite tank is the Challenger 2.
28-01-2019T14:50:39,Twokinds,I've been trying to decide which one to use
28-01-2019T14:50:42,Twokinds,I think I'm going with the tiger
28-01-2019T14:51:03,CrimsonQuill,Panzer Nat? That'll be interesting.
28-01-2019T14:51:22,Twokinds,"I considered the Panzer, but... I honestly like how to the tiger looks better."
28-01-2019T14:51:48,CrimsonQuill,I'm not the most knowledgable about tanks (my father's far more studious than I am) but the Tiger was rather complicated as a vehicle.
28-01-2019T14:51:48,Twokinds,"Just, visually."
28-01-2019T14:52:00,CrimsonQuill,I look forward to seeing it drawn.
28-01-2019T14:52:10,CrimsonQuill,They are really an iconic tank.
28-01-2019T14:52:29,CrimsonQuill,"And I agree, tigers look better than Panzers."

28-01-2019T15:49:50,iliar,Another one ArtBook... nice! I'll be honest I like ArtBook more than Comic Book. Because when I get Comic Book I didn't get new experience. I already seen it on site.
28-01-2019T15:49:59,iliar,But ArtBook. New content always great.
28-01-2019T15:50:28,Twokinds,Yeah trouble with artbook is that it requires making a bunch of art.

28-01-2019T20:21:42,Twokinds,It's all I've been doing today
28-01-2019T20:30:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Ok. At least it’s something
28-01-2019T20:30:50,SpazztasticKiwi,that’s good right
28-01-2019T20:31:02,CrRAR,We... tank you for the dedication. :D
28-01-2019T20:31:20,Bgrmystr2,Tanks :V
28-01-2019T20:32:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Terrible puns
28-01-2019T20:32:14,SpazztasticKiwi,No where near military grade
28-01-2019T20:33:25,CrRAR,"Ironclad though, yes!"

28-01-2019T21:10:02,CrRAR,(And the climate)
28-01-2019T21:10:26,Ordithus,"By staying inside, where it is warm.  And not dying.  So I can continue to work."
28-01-2019T21:10:44,Ordithus,"I may not be the most productive employee, but I'm way more useful alive than an icicle."
28-01-2019T21:12:25,Bgrmystr2,can confirm
28-01-2019T21:12:37,CrRAR,I’m just pissed this year at the lack of snowdays.
28-01-2019T21:12:50,Bgrmystr2,"also, the cold can be an excuse for if you do get sick :V"
28-01-2019T21:20:37,Dadrobit,Transplant successful.
28-01-2019T21:20:50,SpazztasticKiwi,But did the patient live
28-01-2019T21:21:12,SonOfGoku,Were there any complications?
28-01-2019T21:21:15,Dadrobit,"Yeah, though it was suuuper sketchy for a bit."
28-01-2019T21:21:30,Dadrobit,CPU was damn near welded to the old cooler.
28-01-2019T21:21:49,SpazztasticKiwi,“I will not release! My brother!”
28-01-2019T21:21:51,Dadrobit,Ended up popping the cpu out with the cooler trying to remove it.
28-01-2019T21:22:02,CrRAR,wow
28-01-2019T21:22:07,Dadrobit,Was afraid I borked my mobo right off the bat.
28-01-2019T21:23:03,CrRAR,Protip: rubber cement is no good substitute for thermal paste
28-01-2019T21:23:22,Bgrmystr2,that actually happens sometimes for cpus and coolers
28-01-2019T21:23:36,CrRAR,Yeah when the stuff dries out or w/e
28-01-2019T21:23:47,Bgrmystr2,"it's not like.. majority or anything, but it is actually fairly common."
28-01-2019T21:24:02,CrRAR,Was it a OEM intel/amd heatsink?
28-01-2019T21:24:15,Dadrobit,"Yeah, it was stock."
28-01-2019T21:24:19,Bgrmystr2,1 or 2 out of 10 computers I've worked on had it happen
28-01-2019T21:24:21,Dadrobit,Totally dry.
28-01-2019T21:24:51,Dadrobit,And it sounded like a mini-turbine too often for comfort.
28-01-2019T21:24:51,CrRAR,Yeah that stuff gums up.
28-01-2019T21:25:08,Dadrobit,Got some third party stuff for the new cooler.
28-01-2019T21:25:18,CrRAR,:ok_hand:
28-01-2019T21:25:35,Bgrmystr2,"the whole point is transferring heat with no air pockets so yeah some of the ones that stick together cool better than the ones that didn't stick together,"
28-01-2019T21:25:55,CrRAR,Gotta fill dem micro-pokets~
28-01-2019T21:25:58,Bgrmystr2,yup
28-01-2019T21:26:07,Bgrmystr2,"new cooler, new thermal paste, all good"
28-01-2019T21:26:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Thermal pate makes me think of toothpaste for volcanoes
28-01-2019T21:26:34,Dadrobit,"Though, honestly, I could probably do with an upgrade one day in the future for my desktop. Still running a 6 or 7 year old cpu."
28-01-2019T21:26:57,Dadrobit,AMD FX-8350
28-01-2019T21:27:07,Dadrobit,Problem is. It still works just fine.
28-01-2019T21:27:26,CrRAR,Yeah
28-01-2019T21:27:31,Bgrmystr2,mine is near 10 years old now
28-01-2019T21:28:08,Ordithus,"FX 8350 is pretty powerful, at least"
28-01-2019T21:28:16,Ordithus,My desktop has an 8370
28-01-2019T21:28:19,Dadrobit,"Yeah, it's a workhorse."
28-01-2019T21:28:26,Ordithus,"More than happy with that, though I don't really game nowadays"
28-01-2019T21:28:39,Ordithus,It chugs through photo editing like a demon
28-01-2019T21:29:55,CrRAR,"I got like... a 4770k in one computer and a 4790k in another, still plenty of juice."
28-01-2019T21:30:08,Bgrmystr2,"Wish I had one of those, mine is just a $165 Phenom II 955. It's old, but it wasn't a $1000 quad core intel which was the only alternative."
28-01-2019T21:30:38,CrRAR,Was that the Pentium D eraish?
28-01-2019T21:31:03,Bgrmystr2,dunno
28-01-2019T21:31:17,CrRAR,I remember the smithfield and presler cores were numbered similar.
28-01-2019T21:31:33,Bgrmystr2,"When I bought my system on newegg back in Dec of 09, literally everything was either $1000 or sold out."
28-01-2019T21:31:42,Bgrmystr2,it was dumb as shit.
28-01-2019T21:32:00,Bgrmystr2,so I just got a $160 cpu and it's held me fine since then.
28-01-2019T21:32:06,CrRAR,Yeah that sounds around the time I’m thinking.
28-01-2019T21:32:27,CrRAR,Yeah that was coming off the athelon era nad Intel was WAAAAAY behind lol
28-01-2019T21:32:56,Bgrmystr2,"I spent $1200 on the whole system. I wasn't gonna pay $1000 for the CPU alone, that's fucktardedly expensive."
28-01-2019T21:33:18,Bgrmystr2,$20 motherboard with no gpu?
28-01-2019T21:33:28,Bgrmystr2,yeah.. nail that one as a nope
28-01-2019T21:33:38,CrRAR,Hech nawww
28-01-2019T21:34:03,Bgrmystr2,"I plan to upgrade of my cpu dies, I just hope it doesn't."
28-01-2019T21:35:03,Bgrmystr2,Life goals.. hold out till Ryzen 3000 destroys the market with OP chips
28-01-2019T21:35:07,Bgrmystr2,and get one of those.
28-01-2019T21:36:04,Dadrobit,"Quick passmark test is placing it in the 77th percentile. So yeah, I'm more than content. It takes on my sound design projects like a pro still. Hoping to get another few years out of it."
28-01-2019T21:36:29,Bgrmystr2,"good luck man, I hope it goes well"
28-01-2019T21:37:02,Dadrobit,Ohhhhhh~ But a threadripper looks sooo~ inviting...
28-01-2019T21:37:02,CrRAR,"Yeah should be plenty for that, if you were doing mucho high-res video editing it might be a different story."
28-01-2019T21:37:48,CrRAR,The gowing resolutions of dig media is really pushing tech requirements lately.
28-01-2019T21:37:55,CrRAR,*growing
28-01-2019T21:38:00,Bgrmystr2,"The ryzen release later this year should be something you want to watch then, Dadro"
28-01-2019T21:38:28,Dadrobit,Audio engineering has much the same effect. Running 100+ audio tracks with god knows how many plug-ins eats up processing power like it's going out of style.
28-01-2019T21:39:24,CrRAR,"Ahh, I see, yeah increasing parrallel workload’d do it too."
28-01-2019T21:40:08,Dadrobit,"And yeah, new realeases are part of why I'm going back to college to complete my degree and making plans for a stable job as an engineer somewhere."
28-01-2019T21:41:33,CrRAR,Gotta fuel the dream~
28-01-2019T21:41:47,Dadrobit,"All that jazz costs money, and I'm not ~that~ successful workgin from home."
28-01-2019T21:41:49,Dadrobit,yet
28-01-2019T21:43:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I left. For five minutes
28-01-2019T21:44:23,SpazztasticKiwi,My noodles aren’t even done - did you guys have an expression while I was away
28-01-2019T21:44:53,SpazztasticKiwi,expresso
28-01-2019T21:48:09,CrRAR,We are one with the espresso.
28-01-2019T21:48:29,Bgrmystr2,"I have butterscotch chips from Nestle, is that why?"
28-01-2019T21:50:07,CrRAR,:yin_yang:
28-01-2019T21:51:04,CrRAR,"You know, I’ve never tried butterscotch chips but my interest is suddenly piqued."
28-01-2019T21:51:08,Bgrmystr2,:yin_yang:
28-01-2019T21:51:14,Bgrmystr2,they are fairly good
28-01-2019T21:51:29,Bgrmystr2,they're not like chocolate chips where you could just eat em for hours and never tire of the taste
28-01-2019T21:51:32,Bgrmystr2,cuz they're really strong
28-01-2019T21:51:39,Bgrmystr2,"but just for a few of em, they're very good"
28-01-2019T21:51:42,Bgrmystr2,would recommend.
28-01-2019T21:51:51,CrRAR,"Any suggestions, or like just eat em by the handful?"
28-01-2019T21:52:03,Bgrmystr2,oh I'm literally just eating em out the bag
28-01-2019T21:52:29,Bgrmystr2,but any kind of sugary sweetness that looks good to you w/ butterscotch in it would be fine too.
28-01-2019T21:53:05,Bgrmystr2,can always just go with the tried-and-true butterscotch cookies
28-01-2019T21:53:19,CrRAR,ttru
28-01-2019T21:53:19,Bgrmystr2,but it's whatever have you :)
28-01-2019T21:54:25,CrRAR,Now I want em swirled with vanilla ice cream.
28-01-2019T21:54:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I like oatmeal cookies
28-01-2019T21:54:45,CrRAR,:9
28-01-2019T21:54:58,SpazztasticKiwi,And pumpkin/white chocolate
28-01-2019T21:55:03,CrRAR,Raisins or no?
28-01-2019T21:55:19,Bgrmystr2,ew no pls
28-01-2019T21:55:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Though maybe I shouldn’t mention white chocolate ‘round Tom
28-01-2019T21:55:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Raisins/no rasins - I like both ok
28-01-2019T21:55:51,CrRAR,(white) CHOCOLATE!!!
28-01-2019T21:55:57,Bgrmystr2,I remember being there for that but do not remember what happened
28-01-2019T21:56:06,Bgrmystr2,I'm sure I would remember if I were reminded
28-01-2019T21:56:17,Bgrmystr2,but yeah raisin cookies are evil
28-01-2019T21:56:33,Bgrmystr2,"Not inherently evil, but they do evil things."
28-01-2019T21:56:43,Bgrmystr2,Like.. making people believe they're chocolate chip..
28-01-2019T21:56:45,Bgrmystr2,then they're not
28-01-2019T21:56:47,Bgrmystr2,>:U

28-01-2019T21:57:55,Bgrmystr2,Every Raisin cookie.. could have chocolate chips in it instead..
28-01-2019T21:57:58,Bgrmystr2,:(
28-01-2019T21:58:39,CrRAR,If you want to be trule evil mix a batch of cookies with 10% raisins.
28-01-2019T21:59:03,CrRAR,90% chocolate chips
28-01-2019T21:59:15,CrRAR,Then watch the chaos.
28-01-2019T21:59:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Try chocolate/raisin cookies
28-01-2019T21:59:22,Bgrmystr2,..or even evilerest.. make M&M cookies and make half of them skittles
28-01-2019T21:59:33,CrRAR,xD
28-01-2019T21:59:39,Bgrmystr2,so 50% m&m and half skittle in the same cookie
28-01-2019T21:59:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Are they chocolate? Are they raisin? THEYRE BOTH
28-01-2019T22:00:16,Bgrmystr2,yeah chocolate chip + raisin is fairly evil.
28-01-2019T22:02:12,SpazztasticKiwi,🍜
28-01-2019T22:02:47,CrRAR,I’m sure Rose could dig up a recipe in one of the estate’s dusty old recipe books.
28-01-2019T22:04:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Ah yes. Trace’s worst feat in deacon form: chocoraisin cookies
28-01-2019T22:04:16,SpazztasticKiwi,demon
28-01-2019T22:04:56,Bgrmystr2,I had to put the chocolate and butterscotch chips away..

28-01-2019T23:31:55,Bgrmystr2,They just want it to be accurate lol
28-01-2019T23:34:44,RimaDraws,let them think how it should be
28-01-2019T23:34:51,RimaDraws,they can use their imagination lol

28-01-2019T23:58:47,Bgrmystr2,All the wireless computers are not getting any signal from it and it keeps logging me out on a wired connection while giving me script errors trying to go through the settings
28-01-2019T23:59:06,Bgrmystr2,absolutely fucked
28-01-2019T23:59:07,Ordithus,Have you tried turning it off and on

28-01-2019T23:59:54,Bgrmystr2,and usually resetting the wireless connection takes about 2 mins
28-01-2019T23:59:58,Bgrmystr2,if that
