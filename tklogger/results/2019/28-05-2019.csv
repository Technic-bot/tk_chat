28-05-2019T12:16:45,AspiringNoodle,This week's been fun so far
28-05-2019T12:17:16,AspiringNoodle,"AMD holds their keynote at Computex.  Intel holds their keynote.  And ever since the AMD keynote, everyone's screaming ""Intel ded"" at the top of their lungs."
28-05-2019T12:18:08,AspiringNoodle,Who's ready for computers to get a LOT more powerful in a short period of time? :D
28-05-2019T12:20:20,TerraTheWizard,"only people i've seen screaming ""intel ded"" is you tbh"
28-05-2019T12:20:34,TerraTheWizard,this just seems like business as usual to me
28-05-2019T12:20:49,TerraTheWizard,the eternal game of pingpong continues
28-05-2019T12:21:12,TerraTheWizard,"or i guess just pong, because computers"

28-05-2019T12:25:29,AspiringNoodle,Look at the tech channels on youtube <3
28-05-2019T12:26:29,AspiringNoodle,"It's gonna be a rough few years, at least.  And that's assuming they can recover."
28-05-2019T12:26:58,AspiringNoodle,"...is there a ""weh"" emote yet?"

28-05-2019T13:44:46,AspiringNoodle,"It was brought up during one of the last 2 streams, can't remember which."
28-05-2019T13:45:07,AspiringNoodle,"Apparently there was an image with a bunch of sketches / doodles with a derpy looking Maddie going ""Weh."""

28-05-2019T15:45:23,Bgrmystr2,"XD yeah Terra a lot of the tech channels are saying intel has nothing, or intel is ded, etc"

28-05-2019T16:17:55,Sclimshady,A 1 mile F-4 tornado just destroyed half the state and they're about to flood the town to keep the dam from breaking.  Kansas is Dying.
28-05-2019T16:18:35,Bgrmystr2,"if the dam breaks, it floods the town anyway."
28-05-2019T16:18:39,Bgrmystr2,so....
28-05-2019T16:18:43,Bgrmystr2,what's the difference?
28-05-2019T16:22:47,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-keith8D:
28-05-2019T16:25:35,Sclimshady,"It floods it more, and with a lot more force."
28-05-2019T16:34:32,Bgrmystr2,"welllll yeah, prolly just release extra water so it doesn't overflow"
28-05-2019T16:44:29,AspiringNoodle,"Bgr, I can always count on you to have my back :ptv-hearts:"

28-05-2019T16:51:39,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-condescending: All according to keikaku. For I am the guardian of the noodle.
28-05-2019T16:52:54,Bgrmystr2,"also, noodle, you are both an inspiration while simultaniously a danger to everyone."
28-05-2019T16:59:15,ElvenHunter84,"Hey Tom, is the Suggestion poll going to be posted on Saturday and we'll have a normal vote with TKpolls this week?"
28-05-2019T17:00:40,ElvenHunter84,Cause if we are doing the voting in advance again the suggestion form should be posted today or tomorrow
28-05-2019T17:18:29,ElvenHunter84,in which case the May patrons would get a bonus suggestion
28-05-2019T17:46:43,Twokinds,So? Doesn't matter.
28-05-2019T18:04:37,ElvenHunter84,"It's fine to give them an extra suggestion, I have no problem with that. I'm just asking if you are sticking to the new Pre-voting system"
28-05-2019T18:05:58,BadFoMo,"(Even though I won't be voting,) I think we should."
28-05-2019T18:06:43,Bgrmystr2,"The May patrons won't get an extra vote, Hunter, cuz there's going to be a stream on sunday regardless of what month it is."
28-05-2019T18:07:29,Bgrmystr2,"also, the sunday is in June. Not May."
28-05-2019T18:09:37,ElvenHunter84,"@Bgr, I meant an extra submission since the way we did the previous week of sketches we submitted our suggestions on wednesday and voted on saturday. if we did that again for the first sketch stream of june, some people would get an extra suggestion"
28-05-2019T18:09:56,ElvenHunter84,"which is fine since there are 5 sundays in june, so we'd get an extra week of sketches no matter what"
28-05-2019T18:10:31,Bgrmystr2,that happens all the time lol
28-05-2019T18:33:42,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:

28-05-2019T18:53:35,AspiringNoodle,"Dangit, pulled a Reni"
28-05-2019T18:54:58,SpazztasticKiwi,I might post that thing I made the other day on Twitter
28-05-2019T18:55:13,AspiringNoodle,"Oooo, do tell!"
28-05-2019T18:56:13,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m on lunch rn though so I’ll be back later
28-05-2019T18:56:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Try holding yourselves together till then
28-05-2019T20:38:45,AspiringNoodle,LMAO
28-05-2019T20:38:54,AspiringNoodle,"Dangit, I keep pulling reni's"
28-05-2019T20:47:59,AspiringNoodle,This first build was very much a learning experience.  My next one wil likely be the long play with parts slowly being upgraded and added over time.
28-05-2019T20:48:05,AspiringNoodle,CURSE OF RENI
28-05-2019T20:50:39,Bgrmystr2,"I ran the GTX 285 for many years before upgrading to the 760. There's literally no reason why a 900 series card can't do 1440p if mine can already do so and is probably half as powerful, if not worse."
28-05-2019T20:50:48,Bgrmystr2,ahh fail.
28-05-2019T20:50:49,AspiringNoodle,"Bruh, you got Reni'd!"
28-05-2019T20:50:55,Bgrmystr2,"no, it's a picarto fail"
28-05-2019T20:51:07,Bgrmystr2,cuz you type the whisper command and it ignores it and goes to normal chat.
28-05-2019T20:51:33,Bgrmystr2,it's been like that for a while now
28-05-2019T20:55:25,AspiringNoodle,"If I nuke every single setting to as low as possible, pessimist me says low - mid 50's"

28-05-2019T21:10:44,AspiringNoodle,"Considering my favorite game from childhood was Starfox 64, and I think that game ran at 8-12 fps often"
28-05-2019T21:10:51,AspiringNoodle,I WILL END THIS SITE
28-05-2019T21:11:19,Bgrmystr2,"ew, getouttahere with that copypaste and come back to me with SNES StarFox :P"

28-05-2019T21:21:11,AspiringNoodle,DID THEY RELEASE NUDES?!?
28-05-2019T21:21:22,Ordithus,What even
28-05-2019T21:21:36,Ordithus,Why would that be the first question
28-05-2019T21:23:55,Ordithus,"No, it's not letting me make links like it used to"

28-05-2019T21:40:57,SpazztasticKiwi,I translate that as “barely”
28-05-2019T21:42:03,SpazztasticKiwi,I have. A comment.  on that emote but the question is should I
28-05-2019T21:43:45,Ordithus,How bad can it be
28-05-2019T21:46:26,AspiringNoodle,"Ironically, that is the most effed up place of the expansion, lore wise."
28-05-2019T21:46:31,AspiringNoodle,DANGIT PICARTO
28-05-2019T21:48:48,SpazztasticKiwi,You asked for it
28-05-2019T21:48:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I thought there were plenty of guys that want a girl to sit on their face. What’s with that look
28-05-2019T21:49:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Also I saved a file on my mobile sketch app and now have no clue where it saved
28-05-2019T21:50:27,Ordithus,":ctwokinds-reniembarrassed:*[Oh, oh my]"
28-05-2019T21:51:39,Bgrmystr2,"Lol kiwi, there's a difference between that emote and what guys actually want. Just cuz guys are not specific doesn't mean they'll accept anything xD"
28-05-2019T21:52:03,Bgrmystr2,"Also, flora is probably heavy."
28-05-2019T21:52:35,Ordithus,[Who you callin' heavy]*:ctwokinds-flomad:
28-05-2019T21:52:43,Bgrmystr2,You! :ptv-pouty:
28-05-2019T21:52:56,SpazztasticKiwi,and that’s exactly why I said I wasn’t particular in actually saying it
28-05-2019T21:53:14,Ordithus,:fire::fire::fire::ctwokinds-sleepoverA:
28-05-2019T21:53:37,Bgrmystr2,"People are not 30-40 pounds. They're several dozen, over a hundred, sometimes more."
28-05-2019T21:54:04,Bgrmystr2,"you don't want a 150pound weight sitting on the back of your skull, now would you? :P"
28-05-2019T21:54:39,Ordithus,"First, she's 135!  Second, no, not really."
28-05-2019T21:55:22,Bgrmystr2,"135lbs is not much lighter. Oh no, taking 15lbs off. xD even that difference alone would feel painful"
28-05-2019T21:55:30,AspiringNoodle,"Idk why Flora is so upset about her bust size, she seems to have other assets to flaunt :ptv-laugh:"
28-05-2019T21:55:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I hauled 150 pieces of chicken and cooked it today. Besides that I haul 40-100 lb boxes of frozen chicken nearly daily when it’s called for
28-05-2019T21:56:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Stocking isn’t fun but I know and am used to that type of weight
28-05-2019T21:56:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Only time it didn’t work out was a huge pile of shrink wrapped supplies came in on a wheelie thingy taller than me
28-05-2019T21:56:57,SpazztasticKiwi,I put my weight on it to start it moving and it laughed
28-05-2019T21:57:36,Ordithus,Who was inside?
28-05-2019T21:57:46,Bgrmystr2,"you're not concentrating all that weight into a small point, kiwi xD"
28-05-2019T21:57:48,Bgrmystr2,so it's not the same
28-05-2019T21:59:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Nobody was inside. It didn’t move. I had to shove to get it rolling
28-05-2019T22:00:58,SpazztasticKiwi,"But besides that, this lady on FB I follow has the best stories. Yesterday she was cutting cardboard boxes up cause with her husbands job they get a metric ton of boxes"
28-05-2019T22:01:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"She cuts one open, and a “very special” doll pops out. Now first she’s about to kill her husband. Then she realized the address is wrong - it’s her neighbors"
28-05-2019T22:03:14,Ordithus,Well that was a close call
28-05-2019T22:03:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"It gets better. Well she can’t exactly walk over and say hey this got put on the wrong porch, so she loads up the doll and goes to dispose of it at a nearby shop dumpster"
28-05-2019T22:04:36,SpazztasticKiwi,"lo and behold, there’s a hobo. Looks at her then the doll. Then her. And the doll. And then asks “you throwing that away”"
28-05-2019T22:05:13,Ordithus,Oh god :ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
28-05-2019T22:05:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Her response had me in pieces. “Well yeah I’m throwing it away. I got a taco downstairs not a crispito”
28-05-2019T22:06:13,Bgrmystr2,"honestly, kiwi, there's nothing stopping her from putting it next door where it was ordered. If someone paid for that, then it's not her job to throw it away. That's actually theft and destruction of property. :x"
28-05-2019T22:06:21,Bgrmystr2,irrelevant of the product in question xD
28-05-2019T22:06:47,Dadrobit,"Yeah, just popping in for a second to mention that IF that story is true, that lady is a Grade A++ Cunt."
28-05-2019T22:06:47,SpazztasticKiwi,If you wait for me to finish the story before nitpicking...
28-05-2019T22:07:06,SpazztasticKiwi,"So she gives it to the hobo, who stays the thing to his backpack out in the open plain as day, writes an Anonymous note with money for the doll’s model for the neighbor"
28-05-2019T22:07:18,SpazztasticKiwi,And calls it a day
28-05-2019T22:08:56,AspiringNoodle,"Um, we may have different definitions of ""at all"" xD"
28-05-2019T22:09:07,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-angry::ptv-angry::ptv-angry:
28-05-2019T22:11:00,Dadrobit,"Yeah, still a turbo cunt tbh. ""Hey, I have this thing that doesn't belong to me, and Iknow EXACTLY who it does belong to. Let me give it to some random fuckking stranger instead!"""
28-05-2019T22:13:21,Dadrobit,"Ah well, now that I'm mildly angry at how much of a douche canoe people can be, I gotta head on into work."
28-05-2019T22:14:05,Ordithus,"Adios, robit"
28-05-2019T22:15:20,Dadrobit,Buenos noches
28-05-2019T22:20:44,AspiringNoodle,Then the standard $$$ for the current expansion + sub
28-05-2019T22:20:59,AspiringNoodle,"...Every time this happens, I get just the tiniest bit angrier"
28-05-2019T22:22:04,Ordithus,"Good, good, let the hate flow through you :ctwokinds-clovischuckle:"
28-05-2019T22:22:21,AspiringNoodle,I WILL END YOU FIRST

28-05-2019T22:30:07,AspiringNoodle,CLOVIS
28-05-2019T22:30:22,AspiringNoodle,I WANT TO HAVE A WORD WITH YOU
28-05-2019T22:31:43,AspiringNoodle,"Any moderators interested in deleting my swear, do so, I got this moving forward."
28-05-2019T22:31:59,Bgrmystr2,Noone cares about people saying the fuck word.
28-05-2019T22:32:12,SpazztasticKiwi,I would’ve likely done similar. Much better than the anxiety of facing your neighbor who you likely don’t know and “here’s your sex doll. It got mixed up in the mail so whoops. But here you are” now both of you have that memory to face each other with
28-05-2019T22:32:19,SpazztasticKiwi,So I guess I’m a cunt too
28-05-2019T22:32:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Goodnight
28-05-2019T22:32:35,AspiringNoodle,"Eh, you never know ;)"
28-05-2019T22:32:43,Bgrmystr2,"You don't have to do that, just ring the doorbell. and leave it in a box"
28-05-2019T22:32:49,Bgrmystr2,or just leave it at the door.
28-05-2019T22:32:54,Bgrmystr2,and don't stay there
28-05-2019T22:48:00,Ordithus,Night Kiwi
28-05-2019T22:57:59,AspiringNoodle,I have so many tabs to crunch through xD
