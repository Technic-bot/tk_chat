08-02-2019T00:00:43,SageSaga,"he asked me if i had downloaded it yet- and i was like ""Why?"""

08-02-2019T00:03:24,Dadrobit,Was quite miffed in my last match. Both squadmates left at the beginning of the match and I still managed second. Probably coulda' won if they'd stayed...
08-02-2019T00:03:38,Bgrmystr2,Overwatch is to the FPS genre as Mario Party was to the generic mario world series

08-02-2019T01:54:32,Bgrmystr2,The cat rebellion has begun.
08-02-2019T01:55:17,unsteddyphoenix,I like the video of the dude punching the kangaroo to save his dog though
08-02-2019T01:55:31,Bgrmystr2,as long as it's not a cat right
08-02-2019T01:55:36,Bgrmystr2,phoenix is a cat SPY

08-02-2019T01:58:43,Dadrobit,Not my fault I died tho. Teammates need to learn that the big glowing orange ball o death isn't their friend.

08-02-2019T02:01:38,Dadrobit,"Also, they should probably learn that simply sitting there with a gun is a bad idea when the enemy is actually just punching them to death"
08-02-2019T02:02:08,Dadrobit,Never not blame the team
08-02-2019T02:02:38,BadFoMo,That reminds me of another Non-Angry Kid video.
08-02-2019T02:04:19,BadFoMo,@Dadrobit should I wisper it to you or waot for Sage to get back and ask to link it.
08-02-2019T02:04:23,BadFoMo,*?

08-02-2019T02:26:55,Dadrobit,Maybe just one more....
08-02-2019T02:27:19,Bgrmystr2,"who said it would end up like that, dadro?"
08-02-2019T02:27:20,Bgrmystr2,cuz yeah
08-02-2019T02:27:24,Bgrmystr2,what they said came true.
08-02-2019T02:27:37,Dadrobit,I CAN QUIT ANY TIME I WANT
08-02-2019T02:27:44,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
08-02-2019T02:27:45,Bgrmystr2,HAHAHahaha
08-02-2019T02:27:49,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
08-02-2019T02:27:50,Bgrmystr2,"oh, dadro."
08-02-2019T02:28:00,MarvTheHugPharaoh,you playing with any one dad or randos?
08-02-2019T02:28:14,unsteddyphoenix,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpXsXr8TZU4
08-02-2019T02:28:17,unsteddyphoenix,Just sayin'
08-02-2019T02:28:27,unsteddyphoenix,Hey!
08-02-2019T02:28:30,Dadrobit,Randos at the moment
08-02-2019T02:28:54,unsteddyphoenix,"As a lawman, im above the law!"
08-02-2019T02:28:56,MarvTheHugPharaoh,If you want next time you can hook up with me and another guy Baron
08-02-2019T02:29:14,Bgrmystr2,"Lol, seems like a common thought process here, phoenix :P"
08-02-2019T02:29:17,Dadrobit,Was actually really content with my last meatshields. Complete newbies and they managed to last until the last moments
08-02-2019T02:29:22,Dadrobit,PS4?
08-02-2019T02:29:31,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"oof, nah we on pc"
08-02-2019T02:29:45,Dadrobit,:( I'm superbad at PC
08-02-2019T02:29:54,MarvTheHugPharaoh,So am I ;-;
08-02-2019T02:30:01,unsteddyphoenix,Shh its ok
08-02-2019T02:30:02,unsteddyphoenix,Me too
08-02-2019T02:30:07,Bgrmystr2,why so bad tho
08-02-2019T02:30:29,Dadrobit,I'm just attuned to the Dualshock 4 at this point.
08-02-2019T02:30:43,Bgrmystr2,can't just connect it to the pc and use it there..?
08-02-2019T02:30:52,SageSaga,Unsteddy- if you want to post a link since you are a mod just say what it is first and post the link XD
08-02-2019T02:31:05,Dadrobit,"I like a challenge, but I'm not gonna do that to myself."
08-02-2019T02:31:21,unsteddyphoenix,"Hm, ok"
08-02-2019T02:31:26,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"why no cross plat, AE!?"
08-02-2019T02:31:34,MarvTheHugPharaoh,EA even
08-02-2019T02:31:50,Bgrmystr2,expecting something that's good for the players..? From EA?
08-02-2019T02:32:03,Bgrmystr2,"Marv.. I know you're insane, but that's a new level"
08-02-2019T02:32:07,SageSaga,My main issue is i cant check what people are posting while streaming - i have to pull out my phone and get the link by clicking on my pc and stopping it before it plays - then use the phone and go to history for my pc-
08-02-2019T02:32:15,Dadrobit,yo yo yo yo
08-02-2019T02:32:18,ZRO4825,What game you guys talkin' 'bout? I was out getting food. :v
08-02-2019T02:32:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Well its also Respawn, so I have some hope"
08-02-2019T02:32:49,Bgrmystr2,"oh they talkin about Apex Legends, Zro"
08-02-2019T02:33:00,ZRO4825,oh -.-
08-02-2019T02:33:03,unsteddyphoenix,But im trustworthy~
08-02-2019T02:33:08,SageSaga,everyone be talking about it
08-02-2019T02:33:22,Dadrobit,I have no idea what I just watched. But the rap sequence was not nearly as good as the ones in Aggretsuko and Devilman Crybaby
08-02-2019T02:33:23,SageSaga,i wonder if this means i have to download it...
08-02-2019T02:33:44,unsteddyphoenix,Oh yeah ofc
08-02-2019T02:33:47,ZRO4825,It's a Battle Royale. I ain't touchin it.
08-02-2019T02:33:47,unsteddyphoenix,SHes just an amatuer
08-02-2019T02:33:53,unsteddyphoenix,Devilman Crybaby raps are awesome
08-02-2019T02:34:25,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I'm normally like that ZRO. But this just feels good."
08-02-2019T02:34:43,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah I thought I was done with battel royals but this looks really good
08-02-2019T02:35:02,Bgrmystr2,"it looks kind of like a cross between borderlands and call of duty to me, but I haven't really played it"
08-02-2019T02:35:19,Bgrmystr2,but just as a battle royale
08-02-2019T02:35:28,ZRO4825,"I'll stick with keeping Overwatch as my main source of anger, tyvm :joy:"
08-02-2019T02:35:28,Dadrobit,Class based battle royale.
08-02-2019T02:36:01,SageSaga,"im generally not a fan of battle royals, but im not gonna make that my only reason for not trying a game- because it makes me logically inconsistent"
08-02-2019T02:36:02,Dadrobit,I'm maining the combat medic at the moment
08-02-2019T02:36:30,Bgrmystr2,I'm kinda indifferent to it.
08-02-2019T02:36:36,SageSaga,people say they arent a fan of Isekai anime- and im a believer in they might have just not found one they like- not that they cant enjoy one
08-02-2019T02:36:52,ZRO4825,I just avoid BRs because I'm that guy who has the same amount of luck as an ice cube vs a bonfire.
08-02-2019T02:37:15,SageSaga,"so if i just say ""all battle royal games are not for me"" its logically inconsistent with my feelings about people liking a genre I do"
08-02-2019T02:38:26,Bgrmystr2,yeah I feel the same sage. There's too much of one genre to really throw a blanket over the whole thing
08-02-2019T02:38:46,Bgrmystr2,"I may end up playing it, I may not. :u"
08-02-2019T02:39:23,SageSaga,"normally i would just say ""I dont have the money for it right now"""
08-02-2019T02:39:28,SageSaga,but its free...
08-02-2019T02:39:29,Dadrobit,Freeeeeee
08-02-2019T02:39:50,SageSaga,and also companies keep telling me to keep my money and not buy their games lately
08-02-2019T02:39:55,Bgrmystr2,oh it begins again..
08-02-2019T02:39:55,SageSaga,its really a messed up time
08-02-2019T02:40:49,unsteddyphoenix,Freeee
08-02-2019T02:40:56,SageSaga,"you know- i was actually interested in a Metro game for once- i was kinda interest in the older ones but the newest one i was like ""That looks really neat! maybe -"""
08-02-2019T02:40:59,MarvTheHugPharaoh,eeeeeeerF
08-02-2019T02:41:12,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Merto is great
08-02-2019T02:41:25,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-unimpressed: Tharks marv.. for that.
08-02-2019T02:41:33,SageSaga,"and then they said ""You cant buy it on steam- Epic Exclusive"""
08-02-2019T02:41:41,ZRO4825,"That's how I feel about FO76. I was like ""Oh sweet, this one seems interesting""  dodge THAT bullet I did! <_>;"
08-02-2019T02:42:44,unsteddyphoenix,Wth is an EPIC exclusive
08-02-2019T02:42:45,Dadrobit,FO76 was never even a blip on the radar for my interests
08-02-2019T02:42:54,SageSaga,EPIC Game Launcher
08-02-2019T02:42:58,Bgrmystr2,I think it's objectively a good thing there's something that's giving steam competition.
08-02-2019T02:43:07,Bgrmystr2,"That being said, dunno if Epic is doin a good job at it."
08-02-2019T02:43:08,Dadrobit,It can only be downloaded through the EpicGames launcher
08-02-2019T02:43:11,Bgrmystr2,Cuz I'm not following it.
08-02-2019T02:43:18,ZRO4825,"I'd agree, if it was competition and not attempting to force people."
08-02-2019T02:43:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,they also allow Devs to keep more of the game revenue
08-02-2019T02:43:41,Bgrmystr2,"not like steam doesn't already do that, there's lots of games that you can't get without getting a steam account"
08-02-2019T02:43:46,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Epic takes like 12% of it while steam does 18% I think
08-02-2019T02:43:53,SageSaga,"Well lets see- no customer reviews, no help forums, no offline play, no groups,"
08-02-2019T02:44:12,ZRO4825,"Actually not as true as it seems, Marv. Steam takes less and less from a game based on sales. From what anyone's been able to find out, EPIC doesn't do that. So once the sales get past a certain point, Steam actually takes *less* than EPIC."
08-02-2019T02:44:18,unsteddyphoenix,Ahh yeah
08-02-2019T02:44:25,SageSaga,and exclusive titles preventing people from being able to get them without Epic
08-02-2019T02:44:31,unsteddyphoenix,Had to redownload origin for apex lol
08-02-2019T02:44:53,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"yeah, but epic is right off the bat 12%, a game has to work up to a point for stream to take less"
08-02-2019T02:45:00,ZRO4825,"I recently had to taint my system with Origin to try out Anthem. Which, actually, was pretty decent imo."
08-02-2019T02:45:42,ZRO4825,"Still ain't fond of EA or Origin, but I'm gonna actually keep an eye on what happens with Anthem post-release."
08-02-2019T02:45:55,SageSaga,epic also has no cloud saves no user profiles no mod distribution
08-02-2019T02:46:01,ZRO4825,"If it turns out EA didn't shove their dick too far up Bethesda's ass with it, then I might actually buy the game."
08-02-2019T02:46:04,SageSaga,no library sorting!
08-02-2019T02:46:15,SageSaga,not even a wishlist
08-02-2019T02:46:23,Bgrmystr2,I had to get Origin to be able to get SimCity 4 since my cd drive is dead.
08-02-2019T02:46:29,ZRO4825,:c
08-02-2019T02:46:34,Bgrmystr2,"that being said, free origin."
08-02-2019T02:46:42,Bgrmystr2,and free simcity 4 cuz I already own it.
08-02-2019T02:46:54,ZRO4825,"But yeah, other companies keep trying to make their own Steam platforms...and keep failing short of the mark, badly, lol"
08-02-2019T02:47:15,Bgrmystr2,and Steam REFUSED to give me a code for it even though I have both the original code on the box and legitimate proof that of who purchased it and where it was purchased.
08-02-2019T02:47:24,SpazztasticKiwi,🛌
08-02-2019T02:47:30,Dadrobit,o/ Spazz
08-02-2019T02:47:41,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nighty night kiwi
08-02-2019T02:47:42,SageSaga,Epic is throwing around fortnite money to make their platform compete through exclusive games
08-02-2019T02:47:45,Bgrmystr2,"so with steam being an assbag, Origin was legitimately the superior option for simcity 4."
08-02-2019T02:47:59,SageSaga,not by being useful or helpful or a better service
08-02-2019T02:48:21,Bgrmystr2,yeah they're probably not the heros we deserve.
08-02-2019T02:52:27,SageSaga,"Epic paid for The Division 2, Ashen, Satisfactory,  Metro Exodus - which was taken off of steam only a week ago that people had already preordered and it comes out like next week"
08-02-2019T02:52:28,ZRO4825,"All the heroes I deserve have long hair, cute faces, and a large rack. At least that's what I keep telling myself in hopes that it'll be a self-fulfilling prophecy. =D"
08-02-2019T02:53:17,Bgrmystr2,"you can only self-fulfilling prophecy on yourself, not other people."
08-02-2019T02:53:31,Bgrmystr2,so.. that unfortunately doesn't work.
08-02-2019T02:53:38,Bgrmystr2,"I mean.. hence the ""self"" part"
08-02-2019T02:53:39,SageSaga,oh! and a Dev from Metro pulled a terrible move
08-02-2019T02:53:53,Dadrobit,I'll just sit over here quietly with my PSN subscription...
08-02-2019T02:53:59,SageSaga,"""If you boycott our game for using the EpicStore, then we just wont make the games for the PC anymore"""
08-02-2019T02:54:14,ZRO4825,I legit laughed HARD when I read that.
08-02-2019T02:54:23,Bgrmystr2,legit suicide.
08-02-2019T02:54:31,ZRO4825,"All I could think was ""Sure, go ahead, shoot yourself in the nuts. That'll work."" lol"
08-02-2019T02:54:54,Dadrobit,"Where have I heard that before, Oh yeah! ""If you don't like it, don't buy Battlefield 5!"""
08-02-2019T02:54:57,SageSaga,"""Dont you guys have phones?"""
08-02-2019T02:55:06,ZRO4825,:rofl:
08-02-2019T02:55:12,Dadrobit,*Proceeds to have the worst sales of any BF mainseries game ever*
08-02-2019T02:55:44,ZRO4825,"omg I couldn't believe when I read about that from Blizzard. I'm a pretty big fanboy of Blizz's stuff over the years, but I heard about Diablo Immortal and I just stopped and shook my head."
08-02-2019T02:56:03,unsteddyphoenix,Oh yeah lmao
08-02-2019T02:56:06,Bgrmystr2,yeah I expected nothing less from blizzard haha
08-02-2019T02:56:08,unsteddyphoenix,What a disaster
08-02-2019T02:56:20,MarvTheHugPharaoh,what don't you have a phone?
08-02-2019T02:56:22,unsteddyphoenix,Didnt they make soldier 76 gay?
08-02-2019T02:56:29,Bgrmystr2,"I don't, actually."
08-02-2019T02:56:31,ZRO4825,"They did, yup."
08-02-2019T02:56:35,Bgrmystr2,Which is why it's so fucking funny to me.
08-02-2019T02:56:39,unsteddyphoenix,Lmao
08-02-2019T02:56:40,Bgrmystr2,because I do not own a smartphone.
08-02-2019T02:56:48,ZRO4825,"But they didn't do it *right* according to some of the LGBT community, lmao"
08-02-2019T02:56:55,Dadrobit,Is fucking every character in that game gay?
08-02-2019T02:57:03,SageSaga,dont see a problem with Soldier being Gay personally
08-02-2019T02:57:06,unsteddyphoenix,you mean that they just did it to cover their own PR mess
08-02-2019T02:57:15,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah its pretty manipulative
08-02-2019T02:57:31,ZRO4825,There were articles attempting to shame Blizz because they didn't make it blatant enough that Soldier was gay. It was basically a side-note detail in a story with him and Ana.
08-02-2019T02:57:46,ZRO4825,Cover what PR mess? Or you talkin' 'bout Diablo?
08-02-2019T02:58:19,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Some of their female workers called out some head members of blizz for being scumy
08-02-2019T02:58:34,ZRO4825,"And I think the only confirmed gay characters in OW are Tracer, and now Soldier."
08-02-2019T02:58:36,SageSaga,that seems odd
08-02-2019T02:58:52,SageSaga,Blizz has been pretty legit for a while
08-02-2019T02:58:56,SageSaga,but Activision -
08-02-2019T02:59:15,ZRO4825,"oooh, yeah, Activision, and their goal for Blizz this year being ""cutting costs"""
08-02-2019T02:59:20,Dadrobit,I thought 76 made 3?
08-02-2019T02:59:33,ZRO4825,"Fuck you, Activision, Blizz was doing great till ya'll stuck your fingers in it. :rage:"
08-02-2019T02:59:45,Dadrobit,"I could be mistaken, but I thought there was another besides Tracer?"
08-02-2019T02:59:47,ZRO4825,:thinking: I only know of Tracer and Soldier.
08-02-2019T02:59:56,unsteddyphoenix,Symmetra?
08-02-2019T03:00:08,ZRO4825,Symmetra gets credit for being autistic.
08-02-2019T03:00:08,SageSaga,Symmetra is super straight
08-02-2019T03:00:28,SageSaga,everything in order
08-02-2019T03:00:34,SageSaga,get it? har har
08-02-2019T03:00:44,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
08-02-2019T03:00:46,ZRO4825,I laughed. I'm not ashamed. :P
08-02-2019T03:00:52,unsteddyphoenix,I exhaled out of my nose
08-02-2019T03:00:59,Dadrobit,Voiced by Anjali Bhimani. Got to have lunch with her and Josh Petersdorf a few years back.
08-02-2019T03:01:36,ZRO4825,:o
08-02-2019T03:01:49,Bgrmystr2,I know literally nothing of whatever meme sage was referencing
08-02-2019T03:01:54,Dadrobit,"Now if they make Roadhog gay, I'm definitely calling him up for another drink, because that conversation would be funny as fuck."
08-02-2019T03:01:57,Bgrmystr2,so I'll just nod and agree. :ptv-confused:
08-02-2019T03:02:10,SageSaga,Symetra is a light construct engineer basically
08-02-2019T03:02:27,SageSaga,and shes obsessive compulsive i think
08-02-2019T03:02:31,ZRO4825,Yup.
08-02-2019T03:02:45,ZRO4825,"Like, not lightly OCD either."
08-02-2019T03:02:49,SageSaga,so shes all about perfect geometry
08-02-2019T03:02:59,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: huh
08-02-2019T03:03:49,DarthRexKing,Goodnight everyone.

08-02-2019T03:04:37,MarvTheHugPharaoh,but you have to buy him]
08-02-2019T03:04:51,DarthRexKing,"Oh! I'm Drex! Darth Rex=Drex. :V I was wondering who that was, but now I get it. Later. :V"
08-02-2019T03:05:20,Bgrmystr2,it only took you like 2 years or somesuch? XD
08-02-2019T03:05:22,DarthRexKing,Dominus Rex? o3o
08-02-2019T03:05:31,SageSaga,"thats great ""Wanna play a white straight male? Money plz"""
08-02-2019T03:05:31,Dadrobit,o/ Darth
08-02-2019T03:05:56,DarthRexKing,"I think it was last year I saw that name, not two years ago. And Later everyone."
08-02-2019T03:06:10,MarvTheHugPharaoh,well Bloodhound and Pathfinder might be straight.
08-02-2019T03:06:20,Dadrobit,Was about to mention pathfinder
08-02-2019T03:06:31,MarvTheHugPharaoh,lol
08-02-2019T03:06:37,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Pathfinder is my boy
08-02-2019T03:06:45,SageSaga,actually he doesnt look White enough for the white nationalist
08-02-2019T03:06:54,Dadrobit,Select the Arctic skin
08-02-2019T03:07:02,SageSaga,XD
08-02-2019T03:07:07,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Bloodhound is German
08-02-2019T03:07:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Or some one pretending to be German
08-02-2019T03:07:28,Dadrobit,lol
08-02-2019T03:07:59,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Bloodhounds voice acting is not that great imo
08-02-2019T03:08:00,SageSaga,"there was a post somewhere ""Please dont make my Apex Legends Main gay!"""
08-02-2019T03:08:07,unsteddyphoenix,Hahaha

08-02-2019T03:08:43,Bgrmystr2,"holyshit that laughter made me wheeze, my chest hurts"
08-02-2019T03:08:51,Bgrmystr2,that was good
08-02-2019T03:09:15,Dadrobit,Bloodhound is very legitimately just a dude trying to sound German. He keeps on slipping into a more Russian voice as well in some of his quips.
08-02-2019T03:09:24,Bgrmystr2,"sage, all games are dating sims. What u on about."
08-02-2019T03:09:24,Bgrmystr2,:U
08-02-2019T03:09:28,MarvTheHugPharaoh,amazing
08-02-2019T03:09:30,ZRO4825,"I miss the days when no one gave a rat's ass if the character was gay or not, lol"
08-02-2019T03:09:57,SageSaga,"i saw a podcast for a little bit last night and a guy said ""I used to think watching straight porn made me gay so i only watched lesbian stuff"""

08-02-2019T03:10:57,MarvTheHugPharaoh,not gay if there is screaming
08-02-2019T03:11:19,Dadrobit,"Hm, I think he just has an eastern asian accent in general."
08-02-2019T03:11:28,ZRO4825,"Now to play my usual game of ""Please connect tot he damned TV, Switch."""
08-02-2019T03:11:29,Dadrobit,"Like, almost Nordic."
08-02-2019T03:11:43,Dadrobit,Maybe that's what's throwing me
08-02-2019T03:12:28,Dadrobit,"Canonically, Bloodhound ""is a mystery"" with a ""long lost culture"""
08-02-2019T03:12:35,Dadrobit,So no help there

08-02-2019T03:13:09,MarvTheHugPharaoh,All I know is Pathfinder is the closest to titanfall I'm gonna get
08-02-2019T03:13:15,Dadrobit,lol
08-02-2019T03:13:53,MarvTheHugPharaoh,BT didn't die for this
08-02-2019T03:14:11,Dadrobit,Mirage is gonna probably become my main once I unlock him. His set looks so sick to use.
08-02-2019T03:15:09,Dadrobit,Lifeline feels almost OP though
08-02-2019T03:15:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I think I'm gonna stick with robo boy. I died as him too many times to leave him behind
08-02-2019T03:16:34,MarvTheHugPharaoh,and Lifeline saved my ass one game

08-02-2019T03:27:38,Bgrmystr2,oh you cut a scene?
08-02-2019T03:27:40,Bgrmystr2,D:
08-02-2019T03:27:53,SageSaga,"one of the ideas was after she cut the arm off he was going to be like ""That gauntlet gives regenerative properties- when i take it back with my arm from your dead corpse- i'll just reattach it-"" *Kaylin shakes the arm lose out of the gauntlet  into the"

08-02-2019T03:29:22,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock:
08-02-2019T03:31:59,SageSaga,but yeah its a bleed curse- the worse the wound- the more it bleeds- and only magical healing can remove the bleed curse- or it wears off with time but- yeeeeeah
08-02-2019T03:32:51,unsteddyphoenix,Orrrrr...the...other ending
08-02-2019T03:38:18,SageSaga,that last panel is best off being painted

08-02-2019T03:39:30,Bgrmystr2,so it's similar to Open Wounds from Diablo 2 but it eventually stops working.
08-02-2019T03:39:31,MarvTheHugPharaoh,thanks for the stream Sage
08-02-2019T03:39:32,Bgrmystr2,Interesting
08-02-2019T03:39:48,SageSaga,its basically Wounding from DnD
08-02-2019T03:39:48,Bgrmystr2,"nicely drawn sage, lookin forward to this. :D"
08-02-2019T03:40:02,Bgrmystr2,"that's probably what Open Wounds was based off, anyway."

08-02-2019T15:09:17,CatzArt,Hiya Quill! Sorry I missed the twokinds stream yesterday. Busy studying for tests no time for streams. except for now cuz Im procrastinating
08-02-2019T15:10:04,CrimsonQuill,I missed yesterday's stream as well. Time zones...
08-02-2019T15:12:26,CatzArt,Oh yeah its like a two hour jump from here to the UK if my memory is correct

08-02-2019T15:16:03,CrimsonQuill,Sorry
08-02-2019T15:16:04,SageSaga,:P
08-02-2019T15:16:41,SageSaga,Catz- it should have been obvious who i meant when they had a time difference of 12 minutes
08-02-2019T15:16:42,CatzArt,Yeah and Im EST so Im as close as you can get to Quills time zone before you gotta cross the Atlantic
08-02-2019T15:16:59,SageSaga,not true Catz
08-02-2019T15:17:06,CatzArt,No?
08-02-2019T15:17:35,CatzArt,Is eastern standard time not the closest?
08-02-2019T15:18:00,SageSaga,it is not- there is Greenland and Canada after all
08-02-2019T15:18:14,CrRAR,Yeah and the Caribbean has some time zones.
08-02-2019T15:19:03,CatzArt,Yes but i was reffering to the USA.
08-02-2019T15:19:29,SageSaga,Atlantic time i think is the timezone that is next to Eastern
08-02-2019T15:19:37,Tharkis,:ctharkis-earwiggle:
08-02-2019T15:19:48,CatzArt,Tharkis!

08-02-2019T15:19:54,CrimsonQuill,Hiya Tharkis
08-02-2019T15:20:47,CrimsonQuill,Quick Question guys
08-02-2019T15:20:50,CatzArt,Yeah but EST is still the closest you can get to Quills time zone on the Mainland before ya gotta hop on a boat
08-02-2019T15:20:52,CrimsonQuill,Stellaris is on sale in Steam
08-02-2019T15:20:58,CrimsonQuill,Is it worth buying?

08-02-2019T15:44:54,BadFoMo,Yo.
08-02-2019T15:50:25,SpazztasticKiwi,So I picked up all my socks yesterday to clean. And one has managed to disappear before even getting to the washer
08-02-2019T15:51:38,SageSaga,that is their power
08-02-2019T15:52:12,Tharkis,somewhere there's a pocket universe that's just filled with mountains of mismatched single socks
08-02-2019T15:52:53,georgiwolf2232,does tom stream outside of his schedule?
08-02-2019T15:53:07,CatzArt,on occasion
08-02-2019T15:53:18,Bgrmystr2,"yes he does, and he's gonna be streaming today"
08-02-2019T15:53:28,Bgrmystr2,in bout 6 mins
08-02-2019T15:54:10,SpazztasticKiwi,I have been reading room a bit - getting rid of “why do I still have this?”
08-02-2019T15:54:22,georgiwolf2232,oh cool
08-02-2019T15:54:34,georgiwolf2232,i was hoping he would stream again
08-02-2019T15:54:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Watch me find it in a week or something nowhere near where the reset was
08-02-2019T15:54:39,SpazztasticKiwi,rest
08-02-2019T15:57:46,CrRAR,The void needs its socky tribute.
08-02-2019T15:59:24,SageSaga,it's best when you find it right in front of the washer- when you go to get them out
08-02-2019T15:59:33,sunblaze,the neighbour kid probably wanted to make sock-puppets again
08-02-2019T15:59:37,sunblaze,sneaky one .D
08-02-2019T15:59:43,CrRAR,lol
08-02-2019T16:00:00,CrRAR,Follow the trail of google stick-on eyes .
08-02-2019T16:00:14,CrRAR,They hold the secret.

08-02-2019T16:03:36,BadFoMo,"Is it just me, or does it look like Kaylin's right hand is missing in panel 5?"
08-02-2019T16:07:30,SageSaga,why would it look that way?
08-02-2019T16:08:53,DanielXD,Hello
08-02-2019T16:09:02,SageSaga,yo
08-02-2019T16:09:05,BadFoMo,The wrist thing and the temp background look almost the same.
08-02-2019T16:09:07,DanielXD,Sup
08-02-2019T16:09:32,SageSaga,work'n
08-02-2019T16:09:51,DanielXD,So hows everyone doing?
08-02-2019T16:09:52,SageSaga,wow so Bad you have trouble seeing the difference between those shades of brown?
08-02-2019T16:10:11,SageSaga,that's interesting
08-02-2019T16:10:20,BadFoMo,...A little.
08-02-2019T16:10:29,RimaDraws,i dont see it as the same
08-02-2019T16:10:44,SageSaga,do you have any issues with color blindness?
08-02-2019T16:11:37,BadFoMo,It also helps that the blade of the sword was between the two colors.
08-02-2019T16:11:54,SageSaga,o_O
08-02-2019T16:12:05,RimaDraws,what
08-02-2019T16:12:05,NibblyBot,New Patreon Post: Book Club https://www.patreon.com/posts/book-club-24588215
08-02-2019T16:12:51,SageSaga,ah i think i see what you mean- the lighter color next to the darker brown seperates the two a bit so the darker color looks lighter next to the light grey
08-02-2019T16:13:09,SageSaga,i still see them as distinct different colors but you are seeing an optical illusion
08-02-2019T16:13:38,BadFoMo,I know.
08-02-2019T16:14:51,SageSaga,thankfully the walls arent going to stay brown - i just used it as the background for now- the walls are stucko white wall
08-02-2019T16:15:09,SageSaga,actually i think its a white wash but yeah- its like stucko
08-02-2019T16:20:39,Zakuru,yay

08-02-2019T16:24:45,Dadrobit,IIRC something along the lines of Alaric studying Maddie in a windtunnel to see how she moves so quickly. Maddie being unreasonably aerodynamic.

08-02-2019T17:42:54,Twokinds,Right now I'm just shading in black
08-02-2019T17:43:08,Nekonny,with low opacity setting?
08-02-2019T17:43:15,Twokinds,It's black at 65%
08-02-2019T17:43:28,RimaDraws,looks great tom
08-02-2019T17:43:35,Twokinds,"Usually I use a blue or dark orange, depending on setting."
08-02-2019T17:43:42,Twokinds,But for this scene I wanted different shadows
08-02-2019T17:44:06,CrRAR,weighty shadows
08-02-2019T17:44:17,Twokinds,And I use a Soft Light layer to give color to the lighted areas using a very light orange
08-02-2019T17:44:29,ShadowSoap,Emotional Lighting
08-02-2019T17:44:41,Twokinds,So it's not just straight muddly black
08-02-2019T17:44:42,RimaDraws,might remember that for shading
08-02-2019T17:44:54,Nekonny,srory checks out
08-02-2019T17:44:57,Nekonny,thats neat
