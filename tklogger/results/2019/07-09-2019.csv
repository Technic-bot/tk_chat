07-09-2019T13:57:49,CrimsonQuill,I'm getting better at drawing Raine though. Doodled her while watching Star Wars in Thursday. Really proud of it!

07-09-2019T17:55:11,CrimsonQuill,I am stupid like that.
07-09-2019T17:55:13,BadFoMo,@CrimsonQuill Are you still requesting Raine X Red as 'HalfKinds'?
07-09-2019T17:55:15,CrimsonQuill,Sorry guys.

07-09-2019T17:56:11,CrimsonQuill,Raine looks very flustered here.
07-09-2019T17:57:05,tehbear,"Raine: i invited Maren home, but forgot i left all my fanfics open"
07-09-2019T17:57:07,BadFoMo,Cool. I think my November request might complement it (if it doesn't win before then).
07-09-2019T17:57:28,CrimsonQuill,Interesting
07-09-2019T17:57:42,CrimsonQuill,My first ever sketch success was actually last December too

07-09-2019T18:08:25,CrimsonQuill,I chose CrimsonQuill because I have a Crimson feather quill.
07-09-2019T18:08:44,SpartanCrimson,does anyone sail?
07-09-2019T18:08:56,AnuSekaniArt,I do not
07-09-2019T18:09:14,CrimsonQuill,If by 'sail' you mean 'helped pilot a small dingy a few years ago' then yes.
07-09-2019T18:09:16,SomeNiceUser,"I chose SomeNiceUser because I’m nice, plus I’m not good with names."

07-09-2019T18:25:27,ProsePro7,Also Raine looks a little like Rose in this one

07-09-2019T18:46:59,SomeNiceUser,I would think that the sauna would turn everyone into a human.
07-09-2019T18:47:01,Ordithus,This reference means nothing to me
07-09-2019T18:47:06,FenceEqualizer,And that's how Sauna chan was born.
07-09-2019T18:47:20,SpartanCrimson,ROTFLMAO
07-09-2019T18:47:23,tehbear,magic backfires and turns everyone Basitin
07-09-2019T18:47:31,FloofyCat,We need to derail the chat before Tom gets back

07-09-2019T18:48:04,Katfeathers,"Ep 2 first run, or Brotherhood?"
07-09-2019T18:48:07,winrock,do it
07-09-2019T18:48:10,BadFoMo,What about the magic breaking and turning everyone else into Huma/Keiduan/Basitin(/Dragon?) Hybrids?
07-09-2019T18:48:21,BadFoMo,*Human
07-09-2019T18:48:21,tehbear,i would prefer that
07-09-2019T18:48:26,tehbear,humans are meh
07-09-2019T18:48:34,FloofyCat,Urhhmmm I think Brotherhood episode 2 and episode 3 on original? I can't remember.

07-09-2019T18:48:54,ArkanaCat,Keidran Can Can dance
07-09-2019T18:49:01,FloofyCat,What about magic making everyone paranoid
07-09-2019T18:49:06,FloofyCat,Very paranoid
07-09-2019T18:49:19,SpartanCrimson,i am already very paranoid
07-09-2019T18:49:40,FloofyCat,Kat: FLORA GUNNA STEAL MY CHEST I SWEAR! *wild crazy broomstick swinging*
07-09-2019T18:49:42,CrimsonQuill,"Ummm....Caboose in a Bathtub being pushed by Iron Man, who is being chased by the Doctor in the TARDIS."
07-09-2019T18:49:43,SomeNiceUser,What about magic turning everyone’s gender.
07-09-2019T18:49:49,CrimsonQuill,That's my crazy thing
07-09-2019T18:49:58,SpartanCrimson,genderbender
07-09-2019T18:50:08,Katfeathers,And now I forget if that's the end of the first town or the second stop
07-09-2019T18:50:13,FloofyCat,@SomeNiceUser Ya' mean sex or actually just gender?
07-09-2019T18:50:28,tehbear,Quill: sounds difficult to sketch
07-09-2019T18:50:34,FloofyCat,Change everyone's sex then give them crippling dysphoria!
07-09-2019T18:50:47,SomeNiceUser,Yes!
07-09-2019T18:51:08,tehbear,everyone is turned into a giant like Adelaide
07-09-2019T18:51:27,SomeNiceUser,Battle of the giants.
07-09-2019T18:51:32,ShadowedHand,What’s he asking for?
07-09-2019T18:51:35,FloofyCat,"Nora disguises herself as Kat but gets ambushed by Kat, Evil Kat and Human Kat then Eric walks in."
07-09-2019T18:52:02,tehbear,thats a lot of Kat
07-09-2019T18:52:10,tehbear,a katastrophe
07-09-2019T18:52:11,SomeNiceUser,Kat harem.
07-09-2019T18:52:15,TeapotOfDoom,I bet Eric would try to flirt with her
07-09-2019T18:52:24,FloofyCat,Tbh I kinda wanna see Na'rella shenanigans before Trace et al got there.
07-09-2019T18:52:37,SpartanCrimson,on DA i got blocked by one guy and i was scared for a whole month that everyone was just going to randomly block me
07-09-2019T18:53:03,ShadowedHand,3
07-09-2019T18:53:09,SpartanCrimson,2
07-09-2019T18:53:10,FloofyCat,Na'Rella shenanigans would be lovely. Evals and Mike both terrified of the slightest thing that turns out to be completely innocent.
07-09-2019T18:53:12,Katfeathers,"It has already been shown that Eric has a keen ""Kat or not"" sense"
07-09-2019T18:53:29,FloofyCat,Yup. Trace has a Flora-or-not sense too.
07-09-2019T18:53:46,tehbear,genuine Kat

07-09-2019T18:55:05,Twokinds,I have no bread
07-09-2019T18:55:05,FloofyCat,Stream starts at 4pm Tom's time and it has been going for 03:53 so yup it's probably 8pm for Tom.

07-09-2019T21:16:49,FenceEqualizer,Nice job Tom. Like the very subtle difference in cheek fluff
07-09-2019T21:17:10,unsteddyphoenix,...it must be VERY subtle
07-09-2019T21:17:28,CrimsonQuill,I've just realised.
07-09-2019T21:17:28,Orthonox,It's the least conspicuous form she has adorned. I barely noticed the horns and chest tuft.
07-09-2019T21:17:33,Starborn,And chest fluff
07-09-2019T21:17:34,Katfeathers,Iget the feeling Nora's headhair would be a bit more metallic
07-09-2019T21:17:35,CrimsonQuill,I have gone the whole stream.

07-09-2019T21:50:08,SpazztasticKiwi,"it’s a given if you’re here, you have at least one perverted bone in your body"
07-09-2019T21:50:30,SomeNiceUser,That’s only if you are a dog though.
07-09-2019T21:50:36,Sclimshady,How dare you accuse me of that :cw0lfmare-EmberSad:

07-09-2019T21:52:06,SpazztasticKiwi,a dog doesn’t have a perverted bone; animal can only act like animal without self awareness or free will
07-09-2019T21:52:50,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t start of finish fights; much are too worthless to involve myself in
07-09-2019T21:52:54,SpazztasticKiwi,or

07-09-2019T21:56:02,SpazztasticKiwi,there’s a difference in finishing something because or ignoring or passing it by when it no longer holds worth
07-09-2019T21:56:54,SpazztasticKiwi,but anyway
07-09-2019T21:57:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve been looking at book shelves since I don’t remember and have yet to find a good match for what I want

07-09-2019T22:15:09,Sclimshady,It was from the black tar wasnt it
07-09-2019T22:15:20,Sclimshady,Common injection site
07-09-2019T22:16:56,SpazztasticKiwi,it was him doing something stupid and cutting his lip on a can he dug out of the garbage
07-09-2019T22:17:15,Sclimshady,"Ah, cat stuff, I see"
07-09-2019T22:17:49,Ordithus,"those are sharp, ouch"
07-09-2019T22:18:00,SpazztasticKiwi,because having a closed bin that’s reasonably away from climbable surfaces isn’t enough to keep him out
07-09-2019T22:18:42,SpazztasticKiwi,though that’s not the case since he pulled it out of one of the bags set to be taken out that coming morning
07-09-2019T22:19:01,SpazztasticKiwi,there wasn’t blood
07-09-2019T22:19:15,SpazztasticKiwi,he just sorta more shaved the fur off his lip

07-09-2019T22:20:54,SpazztasticKiwi,all that’d happen is a fringe of fuzz running from his nose to his tail
07-09-2019T22:20:55,Sclimshady,Even shorter when you're done
07-09-2019T22:22:40,SpazztasticKiwi,then I can’t get him a tarantula costume for halloween
