10-06-2019T00:00:43,AspiringNoodle,"I'm having GPU-related troubles.  With a little over a week left to try out some software before a sale ends, and a little under a month before I build a new PC. Perfect timing :ptv-hearts:"
10-06-2019T00:01:14,AspiringNoodle,"But enough about me, what about you? :D"
10-06-2019T00:01:49,metalman20,"oooh i know those pains, hope things are able to work out noodle.  and i'm doing pretty good"
10-06-2019T00:02:10,metalman20,honestly i'm really happy i've discovered twokinds and the community cause i honestly love everything about it
10-06-2019T00:03:11,AspiringNoodle,"I want to take up drawing.  If I'm lucky / work hard enough, maybe I'll be a fraction as successful as Tom <3"
10-06-2019T00:03:42,AspiringNoodle,"That said, the internet changes really quickly."
10-06-2019T00:04:04,metalman20,"that's definitly true, just one day can be an eternity in interet years"
10-06-2019T00:04:34,Bgrmystr2,lol you love everything about the community?
10-06-2019T00:04:35,Bgrmystr2,give it time.
10-06-2019T00:04:41,AspiringNoodle,"The way I see it, if I start now, it'd be like trying to start a gaming channel on YouTube."
10-06-2019T00:04:59,AspiringNoodle,Looooooooots of competition.
10-06-2019T00:05:36,metalman20,it gets lewd in this community doesn't it bgrmystr2 lol. and the competition is nuts for gaming channels
10-06-2019T00:05:45,AspiringNoodle,"But that is rather cool, there are two youtubers who do mostly Dark Souls content who have recently gotten to the point where they can live off it."
10-06-2019T00:06:24,AspiringNoodle,"And yes, I've asked myself, ""Why do I want to do this?  Is it for the money?  The popularity?  Do I just really like doing this and want to make a living off it?"""
10-06-2019T00:06:47,AspiringNoodle,"Drawing would be a bit of a late start compared to video games, but I imagine it'd be more satisfying :3"
10-06-2019T00:07:18,Bgrmystr2,"technically yes metal, but that's not the bad part don't worry."
10-06-2019T00:07:34,AspiringNoodle,Is it the psycho fans?
10-06-2019T00:08:05,metalman20,that's pretty cool noodle and i feel it probalby would be more satisfying though i feel if anyone can be able to make a living off of something they enjoy it would be satisfying regardless
10-06-2019T00:08:12,Bgrmystr2,some of the scarier fans are not the vocal ones imo.
10-06-2019T00:08:31,Bgrmystr2,"some are vocal, some aren't."
10-06-2019T00:08:38,Bgrmystr2,"hard to say, gotta see em in action."
10-06-2019T00:09:36,metalman20,ah well i feel i can handle it (i might regret saying that lol)
10-06-2019T00:11:44,AspiringNoodle,"Oh yeah, and I forgot, YouTube won't stop trying to claim the title of world's stupidest company.  So YouTube is becoming more and more volatile as a platform..."
10-06-2019T00:12:23,AspiringNoodle,They seem to LOVE caving in to the organizations that would revel in its collapse.
10-06-2019T00:13:06,metalman20,i reallllly hate how youtube has already bascially dug it's own grave and is at this point just trying to see how far they can dig it
10-06-2019T00:13:15,AspiringNoodle,^
10-06-2019T00:13:31,AspiringNoodle,What would make me super happy is if the government would grow a pair and finally step in...
10-06-2019T00:13:37,metalman20,i just wish youtube could go back to the way it used to be when they actually gave a damn about the content creators
10-06-2019T00:13:54,AspiringNoodle,"These giant companies hold a monopoly on some aspect of the internet, and they have free reign to do whatever they want."
10-06-2019T00:14:21,AspiringNoodle,"And they always use the argument, ""Oh, but we're a PLATFORM!  We don't curate content."""
10-06-2019T00:14:27,metalman20,there needs to be some kind of limit on what can be done cause one of the biggest jokes on youtube is the crap copyright claim system
10-06-2019T00:14:29,AspiringNoodle,"To which I respond, THEN STOP ACTING LIKE A DAMN PUBLISHER."
10-06-2019T00:14:59,metalman20,also agreed
10-06-2019T00:15:01,AspiringNoodle,I've heard the Jim Sterling (not sure if he's distasteful or not) has played the copyright system like a fiddle.
10-06-2019T00:16:01,metalman20,hmmm not sure how i should feel about that
10-06-2019T00:16:14,AspiringNoodle,"He's one of those channels that seems like it's ripe for claims, but never gets hit.  And in his words, he's created a ""copyright gridlock."""
10-06-2019T00:16:59,AspiringNoodle,"He more or less, if he knows that his video is remotely likely to get struck, he'll throw in so much material from multiple companies, that they'd have to fight over who gets to claim infringement."
10-06-2019T00:17:42,metalman20,well that could definitly be a problem
10-06-2019T00:18:10,AspiringNoodle,"Well, YouTube seems to value these giant companies over the people who actually made the platform what it is and actively keep it alive."
10-06-2019T00:18:17,metalman20,it just sucks constantly seeing good youtubers on twitter showing how they keep getting screwed on youtube cause they really don't deserve it
10-06-2019T00:18:58,AspiringNoodle,The VoxAdpocalypse was a joke.  The government really DOES need to bring the hammer down on youtube.  They were demonitizing nature videos.  They were demonitizing journalists.
10-06-2019T00:19:13,AspiringNoodle,"They were DELETING historical footage of WWII Germany because ""offensive material"""
10-06-2019T00:19:30,AspiringNoodle,"Like... great job YouTube, apparently you WANT World War III."
10-06-2019T00:20:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Ok so obviously I haven’t gotten to sleep yet
10-06-2019T00:20:20,metalman20,doing okay kiwi?
10-06-2019T00:20:20,AspiringNoodle,RENI
10-06-2019T00:20:27,AspiringNoodle,KIWI NEEDS YOUR MAGIC
10-06-2019T00:20:35,SpazztasticKiwi,but if any of you know who Darren Knight is I just watched his teenage boys and teenage girls skits
10-06-2019T00:20:50,SpazztasticKiwi,and my sides hurt
10-06-2019T00:21:21,metalman20,nice i'll have to check his videos out
10-06-2019T00:21:29,AspiringNoodle,"That reminds me, anyone want to see something cringy?"
10-06-2019T00:21:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I get enough of that at work
10-06-2019T00:21:52,Bgrmystr2,mmmmnope
10-06-2019T00:21:58,AspiringNoodle,Damn :P
10-06-2019T00:21:58,Bgrmystr2,I get enough of that watching the community
10-06-2019T00:22:23,AspiringNoodle,Thought I'd keep the Captain Marvel controversy alive.
10-06-2019T00:22:36,metalman20,uggg noooo i'd rather not xd
10-06-2019T00:23:28,AspiringNoodle,"It's a shame, I liked their content (the few videos that I did watch).  But now I'm worried about future taint."
10-06-2019T00:24:32,AspiringNoodle,Anyone here watch ScottFalco?  Or at least know of him?
10-06-2019T00:24:50,metalman20,"no, sorry"
10-06-2019T00:25:29,AspiringNoodle,Well you're about to.  Go find his youtube channel.  He JUST did an animation about his Wind Waker speedrun method.
10-06-2019T00:25:53,AspiringNoodle,7 minutes long.  It's a hilarious parody of all the skips and glitches he uses.
10-06-2019T00:26:15,metalman20,i'll be right back
10-06-2019T00:26:27,AspiringNoodle,...*watches video for severalth time*
10-06-2019T00:33:45,metalman20,that was the most beautiful thing i've ever seen the freaking facial animations had me dying
10-06-2019T00:35:08,AspiringNoodle,xD
10-06-2019T00:35:42,AspiringNoodle,I love animation (it's one of my interests).  But there IS an internal conflict.
10-06-2019T00:35:53,AspiringNoodle,"It's awesome, but it's also time-consuming."
10-06-2019T00:36:30,AspiringNoodle,Also:  YouTube.
10-06-2019T00:37:07,AspiringNoodle,"I swear... it's like every time I turn around, a career path I consider gets shittier"
10-06-2019T00:37:22,metalman20,"might be time consuming, but it's always worth it with the final product"
10-06-2019T00:37:53,AspiringNoodle,Wouldn't be so bad if humans were relatively immortal.
10-06-2019T00:38:13,metalman20,"yeah it's like twitch, so many people trying to be the next ninja that it's difficult to get noticed.  but as long as you're having fun with it, i feel successful with it"
10-06-2019T00:38:16,AspiringNoodle,"Scientists ran the calculations:  If humans attained biological immortality, the average lifespan would be over 9,000 years."
10-06-2019T00:38:41,AspiringNoodle,The downside?  You'd die horribly <3
10-06-2019T00:39:05,metalman20,"yeah i can see that, not pleasant"
10-06-2019T00:40:38,AspiringNoodle,"On the bright side:  Think about it, you could do EVERYTHING you ever wanted.  and not feel rushed for time!"
10-06-2019T00:41:26,metalman20,ohhh that does sound nice.  being able to take your time to get something done.
10-06-2019T00:41:34,AspiringNoodle,And there ARE scientists who believe we are close to achieving biological immortality.
10-06-2019T00:41:53,AspiringNoodle,"Not *true* immortality, but something called escape velocity."
10-06-2019T00:42:29,metalman20,"and if we could live for a lot longer, think of all the amazing techology that could be build that we'd get to be alive to witness"
10-06-2019T00:42:32,AspiringNoodle,"Essentially, the amount of time X needed to extend life by Y would become inverted.  As it stands it's something like 5 years of development to extend average lifespans by 1."
10-06-2019T00:43:12,AspiringNoodle,"Even as we approach 1:1, it'll be ridiculous."
10-06-2019T00:43:43,AspiringNoodle,"Hell, maybe we could invent replicators if we achieve escape velocity :ptv-laugh:"
10-06-2019T00:45:10,metalman20,that would be freaking awesome
10-06-2019T00:45:23,metalman20,"i can see it now, how much stuff we would be able to accomplish"
10-06-2019T00:45:59,AspiringNoodle,I'm just thinking of it this way:  People could pursue art and tell the stories they want to tell without having to worry about financial success.
10-06-2019T00:47:57,metalman20,and they'd be able to tell their stories however they wanted to
10-06-2019T00:48:07,metalman20,such as the wonder of art
10-06-2019T01:08:27,metalman20,"i hope you enjoy the rest of your night noodle, i gotta get some sleep"
10-06-2019T01:09:42,AspiringNoodle,Have fun with that~
10-06-2019T01:11:50,metalman20,i'll try lol

10-06-2019T13:49:30,SpazztasticKiwi,That is the question
10-06-2019T14:17:47,AspiringNoodle,Went to the grocery store for the first time in like 1.5 months.  Bought a lot of apples :D
10-06-2019T14:17:59,AspiringNoodle,"Also snack cakes, but don't judge me!"
10-06-2019T14:21:14,Twokinds,I went grocery shopping today too

10-06-2019T19:55:02,AspiringNoodle,It is too pure for this world.
10-06-2019T19:55:07,RimaDraws,it is <3
10-06-2019T19:55:24,AspiringNoodle,One artist already made a gag gift about R34 xD
10-06-2019T19:55:28,AspiringNoodle,gif*
10-06-2019T19:55:45,AspiringNoodle,"It's hilarious, adorable, and makes me want to comfort the poor sheepie."

10-06-2019T19:57:20,AspiringNoodle,"And I lied, they made 2 gifs.  Both are equally adorable."
10-06-2019T19:57:40,RimaDraws,o.o
10-06-2019T19:58:48,AspiringNoodle,Want the 2nd one?  It's less risque and more adorbs
10-06-2019T19:59:17,RimaDraws,nuh
10-06-2019T20:00:59,AspiringNoodle,"Well, your life will forever be the lesser for not witnessing the gags of pure d'aww"
10-06-2019T20:01:24,RimaDraws,i will be alright without it till i get the game
10-06-2019T20:02:33,AspiringNoodle,I don't think you'll be able to add it to your team :)
10-06-2019T20:02:49,RimaDraws,fine with me
10-06-2019T20:03:41,AspiringNoodle,"If I lived in the Pokemon universe, I'd have a Wooloo farm.  I'd need nothing else.  My life would be complete <3"
10-06-2019T20:04:07,AspiringNoodle,*inb4 new pokemon mascot*
10-06-2019T20:42:27,SpazztasticKiwi,"according to pokemon go, I have a 13 pound, 6 foot snake for a pet"
10-06-2019T20:43:10,SpazztasticKiwi,“It would be great if pokemon were real” no it would not - have you looked at the size stats?
10-06-2019T20:47:56,AspiringNoodle,And have you seen Wooloo?
10-06-2019T20:47:59,AspiringNoodle,I would die for it
10-06-2019T21:14:59,Dadrobit,"As someone who has held giant snakes before, that's the least of our Pokemon worries."
10-06-2019T21:15:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom how’s that exercising thing going
10-06-2019T21:16:11,Dadrobit,I'd be much more concerned with them Earth type Pokemon and their trainers using shit like Earthquake for recreational battles.
10-06-2019T21:16:59,Dadrobit,Or half of the Ghost types that do shit like posess children and make them wander into forests to their doom in the middle of the night.
10-06-2019T21:17:36,Sclimshady,Those are already real
10-06-2019T21:18:12,AspiringNoodle,Looks like Wooloo can be used for battle.  But why would you use the floof like that?? :ptv-whiny:
10-06-2019T21:18:42,AspiringNoodle,"Actually... now I want a level 100 Wooloo.  ""Does this look like the face of mercy?"""
10-06-2019T21:19:42,Dadrobit,inb4 wooloo evolves into some horrific monster.
10-06-2019T21:23:07,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve never been one for leather but I’d like this jacket https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/524825976597643265/588191295567036437/image0.jpg

10-06-2019T21:24:21,SpazztasticKiwi,actually it’s legit the jacket
10-06-2019T21:24:41,AspiringNoodle,"Also, I will always keep Wooloo the cute fluffy boi that it is~"
10-06-2019T21:24:56,AspiringNoodle,What's the girl equivalent of boi?
10-06-2019T21:24:57,Sclimshady,"Lets be honest, that jacket is tacky, it's tom youre on about"
10-06-2019T21:25:03,AspiringNoodle,^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
10-06-2019T21:25:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Toms cool yes
10-06-2019T21:25:27,SpazztasticKiwi,There were other models for that jacket
10-06-2019T21:26:04,SpazztasticKiwi,While it’d be likely i wouldn’t wear it but for looks now and then I like it
10-06-2019T21:26:05,AspiringNoodle,"...I swear I'm gonna go out and buy every last pokemon game I've missed at this point, because I want to get caught up on everything"
10-06-2019T21:26:09,AspiringNoodle,ELECTRIC CORGI CONFIRMED
10-06-2019T21:26:44,Sclimshady,I need art of an electric corgo now
10-06-2019T21:27:19,AspiringNoodle,It has a heart on it's butt
10-06-2019T21:27:48,Sclimshady,Perfect
10-06-2019T21:28:04,AspiringNoodle,I haven't played pokemon since the first Black & White.  And now I already know 2 party members.
10-06-2019T21:30:36,AspiringNoodle,"Aw man, when did they release Luigi's Mansion 2??"
10-06-2019T21:31:36,SpazztasticKiwi,guess I won’t be mentioning people I find interesting anymore if this is the reaction

10-06-2019T22:02:19,Ordithus,Been 7 months
10-06-2019T22:03:48,AspiringNoodle,"It's only been like a day, and I already miss my GPU xD"
10-06-2019T22:04:02,AspiringNoodle,"It's like, wow.  My computer is so slow to wake up from sleep now."
10-06-2019T22:05:43,metalman20,nah i did't have time today to watch all his videos.  i was able to watch the nintendo direct tonight though which was amazing
10-06-2019T22:06:06,metalman20,and congrats on your desktop Ordithus!
10-06-2019T22:06:53,Ordithus,Now I wait for the wireless card
10-06-2019T22:07:27,metalman20,any idea on when that comes in?
10-06-2019T22:07:50,Ordithus,thurs/fri
10-06-2019T22:08:10,metalman20,sweet
10-06-2019T22:08:17,Ordithus,then I can send the surface off to be fixed
10-06-2019T22:10:49,metalman20,and then it's show time
10-06-2019T22:10:52,AspiringNoodle,The pain of having only 1 functioning modern computer... anything else lying around is either subpar or incompatible xD
10-06-2019T22:11:32,Ordithus,don't need little baby surfaces running around
10-06-2019T22:12:02,RimaDraws,hi ord
10-06-2019T22:12:17,Ordithus,Rima!
10-06-2019T22:12:45,metalman20,how are you tonight Rima?
10-06-2019T22:30:16,RimaDraws,i am alright....frustrated
10-06-2019T22:30:58,metalman20,"aw i'm sorry, is it okay if i ask what's wrong or is it personal matters?"
10-06-2019T22:33:27,RimaDraws,it is more i am stressed out and had a bad day
10-06-2019T22:35:25,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-reniderp: may tomorrow be a better day
10-06-2019T22:35:29,metalman20,i hope tomorrow is better
10-06-2019T22:35:46,RimaDraws,considering i have to work with the same idiots as i did today no it might not
10-06-2019T22:35:59,AspiringNoodle,Classic shitty coworkers :/
10-06-2019T22:36:12,RimaDraws,like man children are the worst
10-06-2019T22:36:19,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-zenshocked:
10-06-2019T22:37:19,metalman20,well if you need to vent i'm a good listener. and definitly agreed on that
10-06-2019T22:38:05,RimaDraws,its just younger men nowadays are so immature
10-06-2019T22:38:32,metalman20,can't argue with that
10-06-2019T22:41:15,AspiringNoodle,"As a young man, I can vouch for this.  But more in the sense that as far as life goals go, I'm immature.  Mentally, I'm not a jackass :/"
10-06-2019T22:41:31,AspiringNoodle,I assume you mean these young mean belong on the show of the same name.
10-06-2019T22:41:35,AspiringNoodle,men*
10-06-2019T22:41:54,RimaDraws,like one of these boys has Aspergers and its not an excuse to act like a dumbass
10-06-2019T22:42:18,AspiringNoodle,aaaaaaaaaaand point for me
10-06-2019T22:43:35,AspiringNoodle,What kind of work are you doing?  Is their behavior more of an annoyance or a potential hazard?
10-06-2019T22:44:09,RimaDraws,well working at jack daniels is technically a professional job. and we work as temporaries till we get hired full time.
10-06-2019T22:44:18,RimaDraws,but some of these temps like to be immature
10-06-2019T22:44:35,AspiringNoodle,*facepalm*
10-06-2019T22:45:05,RimaDraws,like i get my immature moments but im almost 32
10-06-2019T22:45:27,RimaDraws,i rode out my immature behavior till it settled a bit
10-06-2019T22:46:48,metalman20,"i can see that, everyone does have their immature moment now and then myself included"
10-06-2019T22:48:09,RimaDraws,but this boy and among others acts immature. he is just gross and he acts dumb
10-06-2019T22:48:17,RimaDraws,like no girl thinks that is attractive
10-06-2019T22:50:05,RimaDraws,"and he made some snarky comment about something and was like ""i'm your daddy "" i said ""uh no you're not because my daddy is a better man than you are"""
10-06-2019T22:50:25,Ordithus,yikes
10-06-2019T22:50:25,RimaDraws,i admit that was savage to say but i dont care for young guys acting like they're hot shit
10-06-2019T22:50:45,metalman20,have to agree with ord that's a big yikes righ there
10-06-2019T22:51:05,Ordithus,slapping is assault right
10-06-2019T22:51:42,metalman20,"i honestly don't know, i think so"
10-06-2019T22:52:11,RimaDraws,slap to who me or him
10-06-2019T22:52:20,Ordithus,him
10-06-2019T22:52:31,Ordithus,why would i slap you
10-06-2019T22:52:37,RimaDraws,yea it would be assault lol
10-06-2019T22:52:44,RimaDraws,but i wont do it because i know i am better
10-06-2019T22:52:53,AspiringNoodle,"Actually, I think that's considered battery xD"
10-06-2019T22:52:58,RimaDraws,i was literally shocked he decided to be a smart ass and think it was funny
10-06-2019T22:53:21,RimaDraws,and i mean....like i get when you joke but there is a fine line between joke and asshole.
10-06-2019T22:53:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Rima. I feel you
10-06-2019T22:53:55,AspiringNoodle,"Me:  Shy, nervous, huge fear of failure, takes any job seriously and is all about completing work efficiently and accurately"
10-06-2019T22:54:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Fist guy that tries to get me to call him daddy I’m telling him to go crawl back in his grave
10-06-2019T22:54:18,AspiringNoodle,"The other guy: ""How can I screw around today while doing the minimum amount of work to not get fired..."""
10-06-2019T22:54:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Want to be my dad? I’m lay the part
10-06-2019T22:54:24,RimaDraws,i mean the only one i wanna call that is my old man
10-06-2019T22:54:31,SpazztasticKiwi,play
10-06-2019T22:54:36,metalman20,i don't even know why people act like that in the first place
10-06-2019T22:54:43,Ordithus,:fire:
10-06-2019T22:54:45,Bgrmystr2,"> In an act of physical violence, assault refers to the act which causes the victim to apprehend imminent physical harm, while battery refers to the actual act causing the physical harm."
10-06-2019T22:54:47,AspiringNoodle,"Kiwi, I'm sorry about earlier, I just wanted to poke fun :ptv-sad:"
10-06-2019T22:54:48,Bgrmystr2,says legal site.
10-06-2019T22:54:56,AspiringNoodle,"Eeyyyyyyyyyyy, I was right!"
10-06-2019T22:54:59,RimaDraws,but besides that i had to deal with that all day and the other idiot man children working there. asking dumb gross questions to each other.
10-06-2019T22:55:08,RimaDraws,talking about how this one guys wife was hot
10-06-2019T22:55:13,Bgrmystr2,so they're usually paired together.
10-06-2019T22:55:21,RimaDraws,like guys keep that for break and not while working
10-06-2019T22:55:28,metalman20,"well they clearly don't know much about resepect towards others, that's just sad"
10-06-2019T22:55:40,SpazztasticKiwi,you’re fine dude
10-06-2019T22:56:01,SpazztasticKiwi,yeah the respect for others thing is an issue in some workplaces
10-06-2019T22:56:03,AspiringNoodle,"In my experience... the guys who talk about how ""hot"" and ""sexy"" girls are are typically the creeps MeToo was made for..."
10-06-2019T22:56:30,Bgrmystr2,lol like girls don't also do that :u
10-06-2019T22:56:35,AspiringNoodle,"First job, legit had a guy working there, he was a decent worker.  But his idle conversation during lulls was less than appropriate."
10-06-2019T22:56:46,RimaDraws,i made another savage move on the same guy
10-06-2019T22:56:52,SpazztasticKiwi,like the guy who made the dick joke about the corndog before he quit with me
10-06-2019T22:57:11,AspiringNoodle,"Go figure I don't see him around after awhile, ask what happened, and he was fired for creepy stuff (borderline criminal iirc)"
10-06-2019T22:57:14,RimaDraws,i was joking around that if he said I'm sowwy when he acts smart that i would want $5 for each time he said it
10-06-2019T22:57:18,SpazztasticKiwi,even if something had been said he was gone soon after
10-06-2019T22:57:25,RimaDraws,he was like you cant do that i will call the cops and i said
10-06-2019T22:57:32,RimaDraws,how about i tell them you underage drink
10-06-2019T22:57:43,metalman20,"oooh damn, shots fired"
10-06-2019T22:58:01,AspiringNoodle,Well... dumbass is literally dumb.
10-06-2019T22:58:09,AspiringNoodle,Threatens to call cops over joke
10-06-2019T22:58:22,AspiringNoodle,"Kiwi: ""How about I tell them the ACTUAL crimes you commit instead?"""
10-06-2019T22:58:36,Bgrmystr2,"not that it matters, cuz Rima would have to prove it, and he can just deny it."
10-06-2019T22:58:39,RimaDraws,because i  mean it was annoying he says that but it was just poking fun. and he was like oh i guess you got me there. like yea
10-06-2019T22:58:45,AspiringNoodle,Rima*
10-06-2019T22:58:50,RimaDraws,well he has told everyone at work he drinkns
10-06-2019T22:58:50,AspiringNoodle,"Bleh, I got names switched, haha"
10-06-2019T22:58:54,RimaDraws,and they know hes underage
10-06-2019T22:58:57,Bgrmystr2,the cops have better things to do than that.
10-06-2019T22:59:21,AspiringNoodle,"Believe me... if you call the cops, they WILL show up.  Doesn't matter how stupid the call is..."
10-06-2019T22:59:30,Bgrmystr2,yeah that's their job
10-06-2019T22:59:38,AspiringNoodle,"And if it turns out to be a waste of resources, they'll ticket you for inappropriate use of emergency services."
10-06-2019T22:59:54,RimaDraws,yeap
10-06-2019T22:59:54,SpazztasticKiwi,they’d show. Maybe an investigate. Maybe a ticket who knows
10-06-2019T23:00:21,SpazztasticKiwi,If I had to guess the guy who’s car rolled away from him yesterday got a ticket
10-06-2019T23:00:37,AspiringNoodle,"Oh, you mean kiddie pulling the e-brake and sending it into a ditch? xD"
10-06-2019T23:00:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Yep
10-06-2019T23:01:01,SpazztasticKiwi,If I had to guess he may have gotten a reckless endangerment
10-06-2019T23:01:14,AspiringNoodle,Here's how you can tell I was different as a kid:  I had a nightmare about that kind of scenario.
10-06-2019T23:01:14,SpazztasticKiwi,But I didn’t stick around or ask
10-06-2019T23:01:45,AspiringNoodle,"I cannot remember how old I was when I had this dream, but it's one of those ""random things"" people can remember"
10-06-2019T23:01:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Of course he also got hurt and there wasn’t any huge damage so they may have let him go too
10-06-2019T23:02:10,SpazztasticKiwi,"Rima, think they’ll last as temps?"
10-06-2019T23:02:12,AspiringNoodle,"More or less, in the car, car's locked, brakes fail, car rolls backwards down hill, somehow ends up going into a bottomless void."
10-06-2019T23:02:29,AspiringNoodle,Fun dream to have as a kid ^^
10-06-2019T23:02:35,RimaDraws,anyway i just had a bad day. hoping when i work with those bums again  i dont have any issues
10-06-2019T23:02:49,AspiringNoodle,Just wait until HR catches wind >_>
10-06-2019T23:02:59,SpazztasticKiwi,many people have disaster dreams as kids and even adults
10-06-2019T23:03:02,AspiringNoodle,They probably won't even last the entire trial phase.
10-06-2019T23:03:09,SpazztasticKiwi,brain doesn’t like itself sometimes
10-06-2019T23:03:29,AspiringNoodle,"Me: Life is good, I'm happy, everything I could ever want I have."
10-06-2019T23:03:45,AspiringNoodle,My brain: Here's a COMPLETELY unrealistic life or death scenario to scare you sh*tless :D
10-06-2019T23:03:52,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s weird but I work with primarily women in the deli
10-06-2019T23:04:18,AspiringNoodle,*insert handling meat joke*
10-06-2019T23:04:28,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-hearts:
10-06-2019T23:04:34,Ordithus,speaking of immaturity
10-06-2019T23:04:34,SpazztasticKiwi,likely because most guys that apply do back work or something though the times we’ve gotten male hires they were young and didn’t last
10-06-2019T23:05:04,AspiringNoodle,"Hey, that's my schtick, I like joking about the obligatory joke when an innuendo can be used :P"
10-06-2019T23:05:13,SpazztasticKiwi,maybe they think working in the deli would be boring
10-06-2019T23:05:43,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s not a good schrick
10-06-2019T23:06:04,AspiringNoodle,At least it's more tasteful than making an actual joke >_>
10-06-2019T23:06:21,Ordithus,delis 'round here seem to have a pretty wide mix
10-06-2019T23:06:47,Ordithus,"young, old; male, female; human, killbot"
10-06-2019T23:06:55,AspiringNoodle,"What, no hypnotoad?"
10-06-2019T23:07:02,SpazztasticKiwi,it was just as much a real joke as it could be seeing as though you said it
10-06-2019T23:07:03,AspiringNoodle,Speciest
10-06-2019T23:07:17,AspiringNoodle,Aww :(
10-06-2019T23:08:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I just figure they apply for the back room stuff and such because really when you think of a Walmart job - does your brain shift to a deli
10-06-2019T23:08:41,AspiringNoodle,"That reminds me, I should apply to Walmart."
10-06-2019T23:08:42,SpazztasticKiwi,"Or clothes, electronics, toys and such?"
10-06-2019T23:08:58,AspiringNoodle,For me: kinda.  They basically have *everything*
10-06-2019T23:09:50,SpazztasticKiwi,"also, maybe they don’t like the idea of the cooking and running essentially what equals a food bar"
10-06-2019T23:10:09,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m sure not always a fan
10-06-2019T23:11:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I know a lot of the back room guys like it back there cause they can talk and talk all they want with all the suppliers that come through and each other as they work
10-06-2019T23:11:24,RimaDraws,but yea sorry for the rant guys
10-06-2019T23:11:27,SpazztasticKiwi,They seem to have some fun in their way
10-06-2019T23:11:31,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s good
10-06-2019T23:11:43,SpazztasticKiwi,I get it at least
10-06-2019T23:11:44,AspiringNoodle,"I think we all agree, eff those morons ;)"
10-06-2019T23:11:54,metalman20,it's fine rima
10-06-2019T23:12:04,AspiringNoodle,And seriously... we don't need to mix jackasses with booze more than we already do.
10-06-2019T23:12:13,RimaDraws,night tho guys. i need my rest for work tomorrow.
10-06-2019T23:12:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve shared a story or two. If we can remember a certain person who seemed to believe I owed them a kiss..
10-06-2019T23:12:15,metalman20,"anyways i got work in the morning so please enjoy your night kiwi, noodle, rima"
10-06-2019T23:12:19,RimaDraws,you guys have a good night
10-06-2019T23:12:30,SpazztasticKiwi,nite nite

10-06-2019T23:12:34,Ordithus,"good night rima, dream of bouncy squirrels :ctwokinds-nibrun::ctwokinds-nibrun::ctwokinds-nibrun:"
10-06-2019T23:13:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Job stories are commonly shared. Tis healthy to share
10-06-2019T23:13:23,SpazztasticKiwi,We can rant together
10-06-2019T23:13:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Free therapy

10-06-2019T23:13:40,AspiringNoodle,I'm sure I'll have more to share when I don't have some wonky working arrangement.
10-06-2019T23:14:00,SpazztasticKiwi,the sweetest of dreams to you!
10-06-2019T23:14:22,metalman20,i'm just hoping i don't deal with any restarunt nonsense tomorrow
10-06-2019T23:14:49,Ordithus,I hope I'm more awake tomorrow.  Get things done
10-06-2019T23:17:22,AspiringNoodle,I'm working on sleeping less ^^
10-06-2019T23:17:35,AspiringNoodle,"Trying to get that quality sleep, but not oversleep."
