01-11-2019T00:03:43,SageSaga,thats soon - but its not a module- right? The Eberron Book is the campaign setting book right?
01-11-2019T00:04:06,AnuSekaniArt,Yeah

01-11-2019T00:06:50,Stormagedon,"Did his character by any chance, have no clue where and how he got there? (Lol btw)"
01-11-2019T00:07:23,unsteddyphoenix,cursed name
01-11-2019T00:07:37,SageSaga,Derpwood art - https://www.turaiel.me/twokinds/images/Derpwood.png

01-11-2019T00:08:59,BadXAsh,Can't find any Onenote for it...
01-11-2019T00:09:01,BadXAsh,Damn
01-11-2019T00:09:07,Fjellrev,Hi there! Hi Tom o/
01-11-2019T00:09:10,BadXAsh,But i am considering D&D Beyond
01-11-2019T00:09:28,Stormagedon,Does Dinglewood have Nibbly?
01-11-2019T00:09:30,BadXAsh,But man the cost
01-11-2019T00:10:05,BadXAsh,But i could have all my players keep their character sheets there... and such
01-11-2019T00:10:53,Stormagedon,Dangit it's derpwood... Curse you BadMoFo for getting the two names mixed up (LoL)
01-11-2019T00:11:06,SageSaga,Derpwood i think did have a squirrel Familiar
01-11-2019T00:11:22,BadXAsh,"Or I could just do it like my DM did it in the old days, a book and a pad of paper"
01-11-2019T00:11:23,Stormagedon,"In the Pic, it looks like Nibbly"
01-11-2019T00:11:30,BadFoMo,@Stormagedon Wat?
01-11-2019T00:11:35,SageSaga,Bad- I have yet to see anything on D&D Beyond worth paying for that i dont have elsewhere
01-11-2019T00:11:53,Stormagedon,Don't worry bout it Bad
01-11-2019T00:12:10,BadXAsh,Mostly it would just be a place to maintain my players and let them have access to books
01-11-2019T00:12:20,BadXAsh,But yeah... I should save the money
01-11-2019T00:12:59,BadFoMo,"@SageSaga So, was it based on Nibble, or is it Nibble who went to another reality?"
01-11-2019T00:13:19,RimaDraws,nyna derpy face
01-11-2019T00:13:21,RimaDraws,so cute
01-11-2019T00:13:35,Stormagedon,I think thats a Tom question Bad
01-11-2019T00:13:40,BadXAsh,Player's Handbook	Sourcebook	$29.99 Dungeon Master's Guide	Sourcebook	$29.99 Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide	Sourcebook	$29.99	 Volo's Guide to Monsters	Sourcebook	$29.99  Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus	Sourcebook	$29.99
01-11-2019T00:14:07,unsteddyphoenix,"Dndbeyond is pretty convinient, but yeah I probably wouldnt pay for it"
01-11-2019T00:14:15,BadXAsh,$150 for the basics
01-11-2019T00:14:17,unsteddyphoenix,Luckily lots of people can share one account :D
01-11-2019T00:14:58,BadXAsh,Yeah i don't know anyone who has an account i could borrow
01-11-2019T00:15:50,SageSaga,@BadFoMo it was a familiar made to look like and be called Nibbly
01-11-2019T00:16:01,BadFoMo,Thanks.
01-11-2019T00:16:49,Stormagedon,"So its' Nibbs, but is also not Nibbs?"
01-11-2019T00:17:18,SageSaga,i have actually found wikis to be better sources of rules and info than D&D Beyond which is just sad
01-11-2019T00:18:07,Stormagedon,that is sad
01-11-2019T00:18:34,SageSaga,Wizards has always had trouble when it comes to doing digital anything
01-11-2019T00:18:52,AnuSekaniArt,Yeah lol
01-11-2019T00:19:10,AnuSekaniArt,Though I don't know anyone who does digital TTRPGs well lol
01-11-2019T00:19:13,BadXAsh,It's the Infrastructure that is what's convenient. Managing your campaign and your players have access to all your books digitally
01-11-2019T00:19:15,SageSaga,"they had a terribly clunky website for many many years, a terrible forum, horrible attempts at programs"
01-11-2019T00:19:30,SageSaga,yeah bad- I have that with Dropbox
01-11-2019T00:19:38,Stormagedon,got to start somewhere I guess
01-11-2019T00:19:48,BadXAsh,Yeah dropbox... Hmmm
01-11-2019T00:20:08,unsteddyphoenix,Also the compatibility with our phones/tablets is nice
01-11-2019T00:21:44,SageSaga,Talespire is looking really good- their old kickstarter page - https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bouncyrock/talespire
01-11-2019T00:23:37,BadXAsh,"Oh yeah, what ever happened to that?"
01-11-2019T00:23:52,SageSaga,what are ya talking about?
01-11-2019T00:23:56,SageSaga,its being worked on-
01-11-2019T00:24:09,SageSaga,it only finished the campaign a few months ago
01-11-2019T00:24:19,BadXAsh,I remember seeing the kickstarter page a while back but then i didn't hear anything after that
01-11-2019T00:24:45,SageSaga,it passed its goal and they are doing updates on it often and showing cool progress
01-11-2019T00:25:35,BadXAsh,When do they think it will be released?
01-11-2019T00:25:57,SageSaga,when it's done?
01-11-2019T00:26:18,BadXAsh,ugh
01-11-2019T00:26:25,JojoF2415,I was watching a movie that I completely forgot about the live stream. Either way I’m back

01-11-2019T00:26:54,BadXAsh,I'll still be watching this and chatting
01-11-2019T00:27:03,SageSaga,multitasking
01-11-2019T00:27:22,SageSaga,"*Hangs kid on hook* ""Hold on- gotta comment on this live stream-"""
01-11-2019T00:27:49,SageSaga,btw folks- hes talking about playing Dead By Daylight
01-11-2019T00:28:11,Stormagedon,I Would have never gotten that
01-11-2019T00:28:17,BadXAsh,hehehehe
01-11-2019T00:28:54,SageSaga,Bad's a good friend of mine for a good while
01-11-2019T00:28:59,BadXAsh,Oh Dear lord jesus they got a murderer in their stream!
01-11-2019T00:29:04,SageSaga,not really sure where he came from
01-11-2019T00:29:11,BadXAsh,L4D
01-11-2019T00:29:22,SageSaga,yeah but i joined that late and already knew you
01-11-2019T00:29:39,BadXAsh,Well i was on the Katbox forum for a while as well?
01-11-2019T00:29:48,SageSaga,that was probably it
01-11-2019T00:29:49,BadXAsh,Mihari?
01-11-2019T00:30:08,SageSaga,I knew Mihari before we had anything to do with the Katbox XD
01-11-2019T00:30:22,AnuSekaniArt,Oh nice XD
01-11-2019T00:30:25,BadXAsh,Right but she started playing with me in L4D
01-11-2019T00:30:32,SageSaga,yeah
01-11-2019T00:30:36,BadXAsh,and then we probably started hanging more after that point
01-11-2019T00:30:45,BadXAsh,Ages ago now!
01-11-2019T00:30:57,SageSaga,then there was the Minecraft server with Misty and the people- i know i got to know you better there- along with Silver
01-11-2019T00:31:31,SageSaga,i dont think you really played on that Minecraft server but you were on the chat often
01-11-2019T00:32:05,Stormagedon,"Dang, you guys did a lot"
01-11-2019T00:32:19,Stormagedon,thats honestly really cool
01-11-2019T00:32:44,SageSaga,we're not kids so we've had a lot of time
01-11-2019T00:32:52,SageSaga,met for the first time though this year
01-11-2019T00:33:30,Stormagedon,"Dang, thats cool too"
01-11-2019T00:33:34,ZRO4825,"One day, I shall get to a con. Meet an artist. And probably keel over on the spot as my anxiety finally gets the better of me."
01-11-2019T00:33:48,SageSaga,when we met - Bad was exactly the kinda person I thought he would be in person
01-11-2019T00:34:32,Stormagedon,That predictable huh?
01-11-2019T00:34:54,SageSaga,he doesnt hide behind an online personality- Bad is Bad
01-11-2019T00:34:58,SageSaga,. . . Well
01-11-2019T00:35:02,unsteddyphoenix,You could say he was
01-11-2019T00:35:03,SageSaga,Bad is Himself
01-11-2019T00:35:04,unsteddyphoenix,Bad to the bone
01-11-2019T00:35:30,SageSaga,and his wife is super sweet too
01-11-2019T00:36:07,Stormagedon,"ZRO, one day, I hope that I can give out autographs and stuff, not as an artist. But I hope to make it as an archaeologist"
01-11-2019T00:36:23,Stormagedon,I think that would be really cool
01-11-2019T00:37:59,Stormagedon,"yah, I get Philosophical when I get tired"
01-11-2019T00:39:26,SageSaga,"I occasionally think back on the convention and go ""Oh crap- what did I tell Tom while I was delusional with a fever?"""
01-11-2019T00:40:03,Stormagedon,dang
01-11-2019T00:40:11,SageSaga,most of what i remember was that  I talked a lot
01-11-2019T00:40:33,unsteddyphoenix,Did you confess your love?
01-11-2019T00:40:36,Stormagedon,"That would be me, Talk a lot myself"
01-11-2019T00:40:39,whimsyWanderlost,you probably feel you talked more than you actually did
01-11-2019T00:40:59,SageSaga,I hope so
01-11-2019T00:41:54,SageSaga,Tom? Did I talk a lot while i was in bed with a fever at the hotel room?
01-11-2019T00:42:46,RimaDraws,nyna and her oh no face
01-11-2019T00:43:41,Stormagedon,I think Tom is very focused right now

01-11-2019T01:10:18,Dadrobit,Howdy y'all!

01-11-2019T01:12:32,Dadrobit,"Only been working a few hours, but it's been a looooong night. Huge party, lotta shitfaced piss drunk guests and belligerent Uber drivers. Time for a bit o relaxation."
01-11-2019T01:12:54,AnuSekaniArt,No better way to relax on a Friday night than with a Tom and Sage multistream :P
01-11-2019T01:13:16,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Kick back my dude, and look at tanks and flora"
01-11-2019T01:13:57,JojoF2415,This is how I will end my Friday
01-11-2019T01:14:27,Dadrobit,"Alas, my internet service is balls and I can only watch a slideshow of Tom at the moment."
01-11-2019T01:15:02,Sclimshady,Art power point
01-11-2019T01:15:12,Dadrobit,But I'm generally only here for the chatting with y'all anyways :D

01-11-2019T01:16:29,Sclimshady,That typo is kinda unfortunate
01-11-2019T01:16:33,Dadrobit,"Dada, I think that's a first here."
01-11-2019T01:17:01,JojoF2415,The eyes look so amazing
01-11-2019T01:18:34,unsteddyphoenix,Dada~
01-11-2019T01:19:32,Dadrobit,I... I legitimately am having trouble hearing in my head what you would sound like sayi
01-11-2019T01:19:38,Dadrobit,Saying that
01-11-2019T01:19:57,Sclimshady,Please dont
01-11-2019T01:19:59,unsteddyphoenix,Imagine a baby saying his first words
01-11-2019T01:20:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Having heared his voice, I can imagine it pretty well......0_0"
01-11-2019T01:20:26,Sclimshady,"Teddy, you have never heard my voice"
01-11-2019T01:20:31,Dadrobit,"Yeah, but, like in kiwi."
01-11-2019T01:20:38,RimaDraws,o.o
01-11-2019T01:20:40,Sclimshady,Stop imagining it ;-;
01-11-2019T01:20:46,unsteddyphoenix,Hows your voice sclim is it cute
01-11-2019T01:20:53,SageSaga,@Dadrobit do you ever feel like your screen name was a mistake?

01-11-2019T01:25:04,SageSaga,I didnt have to do any colored pictures today
01-11-2019T01:25:21,Dadrobit,"I recall we played together for like a week with him calling out ""Rob"" and I had no idea."
01-11-2019T01:25:28,Sclimshady,You gonna get some proper sleep?
01-11-2019T01:25:33,Mihari,Hahahahaha

01-11-2019T01:26:29,SageSaga,take care - though I will still be in chat until Tom finishes :P
01-11-2019T01:26:36,Mihari,"Yep, Sage is going to bed early and Tom is going to be a social butterfly embracing all the people!"
01-11-2019T01:26:45,Sclimshady,"Night Sage,  good Nyna faces as always"
01-11-2019T01:26:50,RimaDraws,oh i am sticking around

01-11-2019T01:26:56,Sclimshady,This must be hell
01-11-2019T01:27:04,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Mihari that sounds like the coming of the apocalypse
01-11-2019T01:27:10,RimaDraws,speaking of which i need to draw
01-11-2019T01:27:15,Dadrobit,Can
01-11-2019T01:27:24,Dadrobit,Can insects be furries?
01-11-2019T01:27:31,MarvTheHugPharaoh,......Yes and no
01-11-2019T01:27:31,unsteddyphoenix,Yes absolutely
01-11-2019T01:27:35,Mihari,Yes
01-11-2019T01:27:37,JojoF2415,I don’t know
01-11-2019T01:27:44,unsteddyphoenix,Havent you seen mothgirls? They pretty cute
01-11-2019T01:27:51,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Mothra is best girl
01-11-2019T01:27:55,JojoF2415,No
01-11-2019T01:28:03,JojoF2415,I haven’t seen it
01-11-2019T01:28:11,Dadrobit,I'm not particularly knowledgeable in this field...
01-11-2019T01:28:15,Sclimshady,Mothgirls light up my life
01-11-2019T01:28:35,Dadrobit,Bröther
01-11-2019T01:28:40,Mihari,"The term furry is a classification of a social group, not a species collection."
01-11-2019T01:29:04,unsteddyphoenix,The lööps bröther
01-11-2019T01:29:20,JojoF2415,I remember that

01-11-2019T01:29:47,JojoF2415,I saw that meme in 7th grade

01-11-2019T01:30:12,unsteddyphoenix,Its so good
01-11-2019T01:30:13,JojoF2415,Fat cat with the loops. I think he filled up a toilet
01-11-2019T01:30:34,JojoF2415,I really don’t know. It’s been so long
01-11-2019T01:31:37,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Gosh heck Flora is a cute
01-11-2019T01:31:56,Dadrobit,"Got a giggle outta me, thank you"
01-11-2019T01:32:13,unsteddyphoenix,T H E L O O P S
01-11-2019T01:32:28,JojoF2415,When will the loops be ready
01-11-2019T01:32:44,unsteddyphoenix,The lighting and the mood of this pic was always so good. Even the original.
01-11-2019T01:32:53,Dadrobit,Just download more lööps
01-11-2019T01:33:04,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Just feels max cozy
01-11-2019T01:33:08,unsteddyphoenix,requires addtional lööps
01-11-2019T01:34:00,CrimsonHelsing,"I agree, the lighting in this pic, even the original was so lovely"
01-11-2019T01:34:10,CrimsonHelsing,*and mood
01-11-2019T01:34:31,AnuSekaniArt,Night Sage!
01-11-2019T01:34:33,unsteddyphoenix,One of my fave pics. And it doesnt even have kat in it!
01-11-2019T01:34:35,JojoF2415,I like the color of the picture
01-11-2019T01:34:57,CrimsonHelsing,"just look at her, so happy, content, blissful, peaceful ^w^ <3"
01-11-2019T01:35:01,AnuSekaniArt,"Yeeeeee, the pallete, lighting, and overall pose and expression are really working well together <3"
01-11-2019T01:35:07,Dadrobit,"Could probably make a Kat edit outta this, they're basically the same."
01-11-2019T01:35:12,JojoF2415,Those eyes
01-11-2019T01:35:20,InTheLionsDen,Kat is ready to pop out from under the bed like she did with Keith and Natani.
01-11-2019T01:35:30,unsteddyphoenix,I dont even know where to START with that
01-11-2019T01:35:46,MarvTheHugPharaoh,stripes > spots imo
01-11-2019T01:36:10,unsteddyphoenix,You > go to heck
01-11-2019T01:36:21,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:cw0lfmare-EmberSad: How rude
01-11-2019T01:36:23,Dadrobit,Presumably you'd start with a photo editing program.
01-11-2019T01:37:05,unsteddyphoenix,They have different body types first of all
01-11-2019T01:37:16,JojoF2415,I’m tired but I want to be here
01-11-2019T01:38:23,unsteddyphoenix,Plus Kat is better :ctwokinds-katdryer:
01-11-2019T01:38:33,MarvTheHugPharaoh,X to doubt
01-11-2019T01:38:57,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:ctwokinds-FloDance:
01-11-2019T01:38:58,Dadrobit,"Honestly, Kat>Flora"
01-11-2019T01:39:11,RimaDraws,i like both
01-11-2019T01:39:18,unsteddyphoenix,Youre beginning to see the light~
01-11-2019T01:39:34,JojoF2415,Ive only drawn flora once and kat multiple times
01-11-2019T01:39:39,Sclimshady,At best Kat=Flora
01-11-2019T01:39:52,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"I prefer Flora, she has the funnest personality"
01-11-2019T01:40:03,RimaDraws,^
01-11-2019T01:40:07,CrimsonHelsing,^^^
01-11-2019T01:40:10,Dadrobit,That's me shining a flashlight to see if you're okay in this hole you've dug for yourself actually.
01-11-2019T01:40:18,AnuSekaniArt,XD
01-11-2019T01:40:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,lol
01-11-2019T01:40:34,Sclimshady,XD
01-11-2019T01:40:36,JojoF2415,This song seems familiar
01-11-2019T01:40:42,unsteddyphoenix,hecc u
01-11-2019T01:40:49,AnuSekaniArt,Kat and Flora are both hard to choose for me X3
01-11-2019T01:40:50,unsteddyphoenix,I'll die on this ship
01-11-2019T01:40:56,unsteddyphoenix,Or whatever the phrase
01-11-2019T01:41:04,Dadrobit,"Sry, but Holo is the light and the truth."
01-11-2019T01:41:05,AnuSekaniArt,Hill? :P
01-11-2019T01:41:06,Sclimshady,Because Kat is on it?
01-11-2019T01:41:16,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Holo is OP
01-11-2019T01:41:31,Sclimshady,Holo is the wisest good wolf
01-11-2019T01:41:39,Dadrobit,Obviously Perfect you mean
01-11-2019T01:41:51,unsteddyphoenix,Ugh weebs
01-11-2019T01:42:03,Sclimshady,I think shes my steam pic
01-11-2019T01:42:15,JojoF2415,Who is holo
01-11-2019T01:42:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"In terms of best girl, Holo, Senku, Yoko, and Erza"
01-11-2019T01:42:45,Dadrobit,You say that like you wouldn't binge watch an anime starring Kat
01-11-2019T01:43:59,unsteddyphoenix,...:ctwokinds-rose:
01-11-2019T01:44:18,MarvTheHugPharaoh,A rose anime would be sweet
01-11-2019T01:44:35,Dadrobit,You'd buy the physical Blu Ray edition just in case your internet went out.
01-11-2019T01:44:40,JojoF2415,I rarely watch anime
01-11-2019T01:44:51,unsteddyphoenix,But Rose is a villian
01-11-2019T01:44:52,Mihari,"I'd watch one of Rose cause it seems like life is more interesting that Kat's, but that's my opinion."
01-11-2019T01:45:07,RimaDraws,i am with mihari
01-11-2019T01:45:11,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Same
01-11-2019T01:45:17,Dadrobit,Yup
01-11-2019T01:45:27,CrimsonHelsing,totally
01-11-2019T01:45:28,Sclimshady,Kats would be one of those slice of life animes
01-11-2019T01:45:44,MarvTheHugPharaoh,A sitcom with a laugh track
01-11-2019T01:45:50,Sclimshady,Roses would be a magical tale of shadow forces and evil plots
01-11-2019T01:46:14,Dadrobit,"""Why Won't Big Brother Senpai Notice Me"" would be the first episode."
01-11-2019T01:46:22,Mihari,"You really need to remember Kat's backstory tho, how much would care to watch to see a breed for sex slave given to a child and grew up in slavery? Doesn't seem appealing XD"
01-11-2019T01:46:23,Sclimshady,XD
01-11-2019T01:46:54,RimaDraws,rose has more backstory and she's barely been in twokinds
01-11-2019T01:46:59,unsteddyphoenix,Well you gotta have a tragic backstory to overcome adversity
01-11-2019T01:47:03,JojoF2415,That’s true
01-11-2019T01:47:30,Mihari,"Well, has she really overcome adversity tho? XD"
01-11-2019T01:47:34,Sclimshady,"Teddy, you are just gonna dig a nice big hole to live in"
01-11-2019T01:47:52,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah true slavery is basically nothing
01-11-2019T01:48:05,SageSaga,<_<
01-11-2019T01:48:08,unsteddyphoenix,"Rose could never be the MC, at best she'd be a side character in Euchres anime"
01-11-2019T01:48:19,SageSaga,"I dont think Kat experienced ""True Slavery"""
01-11-2019T01:48:19,Mihari,She was never treated like most slaves so no need to get dramatic.
01-11-2019T01:48:20,RimaDraws,*baps unsteddy*
01-11-2019T01:48:22,Sclimshady,"Wow teddy, kinda spicy for chat doncha think"
01-11-2019T01:48:27,Dadrobit,Euchre's anime would actually be straight fire.
01-11-2019T01:48:35,unsteddyphoenix,I'd watch that
01-11-2019T01:48:39,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Same
01-11-2019T01:49:01,JojoF2415,I need to stay awake
01-11-2019T01:49:06,unsteddyphoenix,I dont think we're in much of a position to judge the differing severities of slavery
01-11-2019T01:49:29,SageSaga,I think maybe you dont know what I know then
01-11-2019T01:49:54,unsteddyphoenix,Thats true!
01-11-2019T01:50:14,Sclimshady,I know everything you know :eye:
01-11-2019T01:50:28,SageSaga,then you must be messed up too
01-11-2019T01:50:35,Dadrobit,"I think it's pretty cut and dry that Kat's experience is not representative, and even Mike and Evals (barring the ship event) have it okay compared to the majority on Mekkan."
01-11-2019T01:51:50,Dadrobit,"I mean, by Roderick's description that a slave collar prevents a slave from even saying the word ""no"", that has some serious fuckin connotation that really isn't depicted."
01-11-2019T01:52:15,unsteddyphoenix,"Thats true, but even a gilded cage is still a cage"
01-11-2019T01:52:33,MarvTheHugPharaoh,♪Despite all my rage♪
01-11-2019T01:53:00,unsteddyphoenix,just a kat in a cage...
01-11-2019T01:53:23,Dadrobit,That's not really an apt comparison. This is like comparing a cage that only allows for standing versus house arrest.
01-11-2019T01:54:36,SageSaga,it is not the same thing
01-11-2019T01:54:49,unsteddyphoenix,"Im just sayin we shouldnt shrug off Kat or the other slaves just because they ""had it easy"" with Eric"
01-11-2019T01:55:09,unsteddyphoenix,Its still...its still indentured servitude
01-11-2019T01:55:41,AnuSekaniArt,"Right, I gotta get some sleep now"
01-11-2019T01:55:48,MarvTheHugPharaoh,nighty night Anu

01-11-2019T02:13:03,SpazztasticKiwi,someone knocks on the door when you’re in there just yell “come back with a warrant”
01-11-2019T02:13:11,SpazztasticKiwi,or “come in”
01-11-2019T02:13:24,Dadrobit,"Not really, was just a bit more soul crushing."
01-11-2019T02:13:27,SpazztasticKiwi,they’ll stop bugging you
01-11-2019T02:13:32,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"""Come back in with a warrent"""

01-11-2019T02:14:36,Dadrobit,"Yeaahhhhh, that wod be less than optimal for me. The folks knocking on my door do it so they can actually enter their own homes. The bugging would intensify immediately."
01-11-2019T02:14:36,unsteddyphoenix,And knowing is half the banter
01-11-2019T02:14:46,Dadrobit,Would*

01-11-2019T02:15:41,Dadrobit,"Very little banter, just usually a mix of pendejo, gringo, and jodido,."
01-11-2019T02:16:15,Dadrobit,"She was not a nice lady. Very ""Skyrim belongs to the Nords"" type."
01-11-2019T02:16:29,JojoF2415,Dumb white wasted

01-11-2019T02:23:45,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Holo gets all the whistlin
01-11-2019T02:24:25,Dadrobit,A veritible wolf whistle you might say.

01-11-2019T02:26:15,SpazztasticKiwi,...because something something about animals joke?
01-11-2019T02:26:37,Dadrobit,Could be a beastars/zootopia thing about interspecial attraction/kinkiness?
01-11-2019T02:26:48,SpazztasticKiwi,yep
01-11-2019T02:26:56,SpazztasticKiwi,looks like it’s that time of night
01-11-2019T02:27:12,Dadrobit,"Also, for those unaware, the beastars manga is legit nutty, highly recommend."
01-11-2019T02:27:30,MarvTheHugPharaoh,The time of night when you watch zootopia alone in bed with a single candle lit
01-11-2019T02:27:38,Dadrobit,Zootopia on meth.
01-11-2019T02:27:47,SpazztasticKiwi,methtopia
01-11-2019T02:27:49,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah its pretty good
01-11-2019T02:28:25,SpazztasticKiwi,gives “try everything” a new spin
01-11-2019T02:28:44,Dadrobit,"Haven't seen the anime yet since it's not out in the US yet, so I wanted a head start. Was NOT what I was expecting."

01-11-2019T15:00:36,Kynum,Terra :3
01-11-2019T15:00:41,SageSaga,no i dont use a glove
01-11-2019T15:01:16,MatyMaty,I've been wondering if I should get one
01-11-2019T15:01:31,RimaDraws,i helps to keep the stylus on track for some reason?
01-11-2019T15:01:33,SageSaga,i just clean my tablet
01-11-2019T15:01:43,RimaDraws,or fingerprint proof
01-11-2019T15:02:01,Kynum,"I use one, 'cuz it makes me look legit :3"
01-11-2019T15:02:04,SageSaga,it just keeps your tablet clean from oils on the hand and such
01-11-2019T15:02:09,SageSaga,but i just clean mine
01-11-2019T15:02:18,RimaDraws,ohh. speaking of i need to clean mine
01-11-2019T15:02:30,MatyMaty,oooh alrighty
01-11-2019T15:03:31,sunblaze,ohhh tom more hydra-Reni :ptv-excited:
01-11-2019T15:03:45,Twokinds,"I've tried tablet gloves, but I can't stand it. I like having my hands free."
01-11-2019T15:04:46,McClaw,Lil'Reni-hydra! Kwaii!
01-11-2019T15:04:55,IronHorseComics,you could get fingerless gloves
01-11-2019T15:05:16,MoonDance,"For Sage and Tom, what would you say is the hardest part of making a comic series?"
01-11-2019T15:05:23,Twokinds,Writing
01-11-2019T15:05:47,SageSaga,backgrounds XD
01-11-2019T15:05:58,RimaDraws,i am with sage
01-11-2019T15:06:02,RimaDraws,backgrounds are hard
01-11-2019T15:06:04,Kynum,oof. backgrounds. true that.
01-11-2019T15:06:06,IronHorseComics,I know I wasn't asked but since I do a webcomic too I will answer anyway: for me it would be doing the lineart
01-11-2019T15:06:21,SageSaga,Tom became godtier at backgrounds and replicating materials
01-11-2019T15:06:32,SageSaga,i still struggle with it
01-11-2019T15:07:01,AnuSekaniArt,I actually had a question of my own for the webcomic makers here: how far out do you have your webcomics written/planned? Always been curious about that XD
01-11-2019T15:07:17,IronHorseComics,years ahead dude
01-11-2019T15:07:18,Zakuru,i have 11-13 chapters outlined and a lot written so far
01-11-2019T15:07:24,IronHorseComics,I love writing this thing
01-11-2019T15:07:40,Kynum,wow
01-11-2019T15:07:42,Zakuru,i always try to have 5 pages thumbnailed ahead
01-11-2019T15:07:45,RimaDraws,i dont have any out yet
01-11-2019T15:07:47,SageSaga,I have Yosh Planned out to the end and AI is also already planned out but i only have a 2 chapter lead written completely as a script
01-11-2019T15:08:05,IronHorseComics,I've had to rewrite multiple chapters though
01-11-2019T15:08:17,IronHorseComics,and even add one as it would be a great setup
01-11-2019T15:08:19,Zakuru,also that jack-o-lantern mouth looks like a batarang :joy:
01-11-2019T15:08:26,BadFoMo,@IronHorseComics Why is that?
01-11-2019T15:08:29,Kynum,x3
01-11-2019T15:08:30,MoonDance,"I understand The struggle for both those things honestly. For me, I have the story- but I struggle with a script for every page"
01-11-2019T15:08:40,IronHorseComics,"I'll explain in a minute, brb"
01-11-2019T15:08:45,TerraTheWizard,bat-o-lantern
01-11-2019T15:08:52,MoonDance,I hate there being unnecessarily low context when there should be
01-11-2019T15:08:59,Kynum,surprise: Reni is the BATMAN
01-11-2019T15:09:13,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-RaineEep:
01-11-2019T15:09:52,Twokinds,"I have an over-arching plot and synopsis to the end, but scripts are written day-by-day"
01-11-2019T15:10:15,Zakuru,nice XD
01-11-2019T15:10:23,SageSaga,"yep thats how i do Yosh, AI is different"
01-11-2019T15:10:32,IronHorseComics,and back
01-11-2019T15:10:42,IronHorseComics,so what happened was that I got my first review
01-11-2019T15:10:48,IronHorseComics,back in March
01-11-2019T15:10:51,IronHorseComics,I think
01-11-2019T15:11:02,TeapotOfDoom,I am back
01-11-2019T15:11:08,Zakuru,tbh i struggle with pacing low moments and high moments but its whatever :3
01-11-2019T15:11:26,IronHorseComics,"it pointed out a writing flaw and how Richard was kinda dull, which he was"
01-11-2019T15:11:26,TeapotOfDoom,It seems people are double teaming here whaddup
01-11-2019T15:11:48,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
01-11-2019T15:12:06,MoonDance,I might try something like that
01-11-2019T15:12:18,Many0,Rawr
01-11-2019T15:12:44,IronHorseComics,now I have had him go through an emotional struggle but there was no weight to it. So about halfway into chapter 3 I started rewriting both it and everything else onward
01-11-2019T15:13:16,BadFoMo,Cool.
01-11-2019T15:13:19,IronHorseComics,"now he's got trauma that DOES have weight to it, it causes him to panic in certain situations"
01-11-2019T15:13:35,AndreasBauch,Hello
01-11-2019T15:13:45,TeapotOfDoom,Aaaaahhh nose stuffed i hate at :ctwokinds-reniderp_flip:
01-11-2019T15:14:08,BadFoMo,"Also, this is making me want to get back to writing my L4D FanFic."
01-11-2019T15:14:18,TeapotOfDoom,O/
01-11-2019T15:14:19,IronHorseComics,"in chapter 4 he's gonna do something pretty stupid that could get him into a lot of trouble and the one girl he doesn't want to date, is the one with blackmail, and the new chapter 5 is what I added"
01-11-2019T15:16:36,BadFoMo,Reni's costume is reminding me of the giant in Monty Python and the Holy Grail.
01-11-2019T15:16:45,IronHorseComics,now what he does is stupid probably even to him but I couldn't pass up the great set up that it presents and I couldn't think of another way to do it so idiot lead character it is
01-11-2019T15:17:37,TeapotOfDoom,Is it a situation where it can be obvious that it's dumb?
01-11-2019T15:18:10,TeapotOfDoom,Also 'tis but a flesh wound. Way to long since i saw that
01-11-2019T15:19:23,RedDragonSyndicate,howdy
01-11-2019T15:19:33,TeapotOfDoom,Yo red o/
01-11-2019T15:19:39,BadFoMo,Yo.
01-11-2019T15:19:45,IronHorseComics,"yeah, kinda"
01-11-2019T15:20:22,IronHorseComics,but I hope the pitch made and a hint of ignorance of how he could get into serious trouble will be just enough
01-11-2019T15:20:40,SageSaga,yo Red!
01-11-2019T15:20:45,IronHorseComics,"and it's too late to change it now, I'm very, very close to that pitch"
01-11-2019T15:21:39,TeapotOfDoom,I was thinking you could maybe get a moke out of it but I dunno the story so dunno
01-11-2019T15:21:45,TeapotOfDoom,*joke
01-11-2019T15:21:57,PurpleLemons,Hiya :wave:
01-11-2019T15:22:11,BadFoMo,Yo.
01-11-2019T15:22:21,TeapotOfDoom,Hi purp
01-11-2019T15:22:52,SageSaga,yo Purple!
01-11-2019T15:23:04,SageSaga,hehe- I have a friend named Red and a Friend named Purple-
01-11-2019T15:23:17,SageSaga,and a character named Blue!
01-11-2019T15:23:40,TeapotOfDoom,All the colors \o/
01-11-2019T15:23:43,SageSaga,"I am Sage, friend of colors"
01-11-2019T15:23:46,RimaDraws,got another named pink?
01-11-2019T15:23:47,MatyMaty,red+blue make purple :thinking:
01-11-2019T15:23:48,RimaDraws,lol
01-11-2019T15:24:31,BadFoMo,thinks of changing his name to 'Plaid'.
01-11-2019T15:24:51,PurpleLemons,gonna have a rainbow soon sage
01-11-2019T15:25:02,TeapotOfDoom,May i ask why fomo?
01-11-2019T15:25:26,RimaDraws,reni so cute
01-11-2019T15:25:41,TeapotOfDoom,Precious reni :ctwokinds-maevecute:
01-11-2019T15:26:38,RimaDraws,cutest of smol dragons
01-11-2019T15:27:06,BadFoMo,Sage was saying that his friends were different colors and I decided to make a joke that probably worked better in my head.
01-11-2019T15:27:07,TeapotOfDoom,Conveniently pocket sized dragon
01-11-2019T15:27:42,TeapotOfDoom,Or me just not knowing english lol
01-11-2019T15:29:48,DarthRexKing,She a derpy King Ghidorah. :V
01-11-2019T15:30:12,DarthRexKing,Though you could say Kaizer King Ghidorah from Godzilla final wars since that one walked on four legs.
01-11-2019T15:31:15,TeapotOfDoom,"If reni's already derpy, how derpy is her kevin then?"
01-11-2019T15:31:37,Kynum,double-derp.
01-11-2019T15:32:11,SageSaga,"actually its a running gag in Godzilla that one of the 3 heads of King Ghidorah is ""derpy"""
01-11-2019T15:32:38,AnuSekaniArt,Hah XD
01-11-2019T15:33:06,BadFoMo,That's not a resent thing?
01-11-2019T15:33:27,SageSaga,nah it goes way back because it was hard to manage all 3 heads
01-11-2019T15:34:05,SageSaga,so occasionally one would kinda just twist or look away oddly
01-11-2019T15:34:21,BadFoMo,"Ah, that makes sense!"
01-11-2019T15:34:36,DarthRexKing,Lol. XD
01-11-2019T15:34:51,TeapotOfDoom,Thus he was named kevin lol
01-11-2019T15:34:59,DarthRexKing,"Wait. . . . .So, how many of you seen King of the monsters, because I don't want to spoil/"
01-11-2019T15:35:08,Kynum,not I
01-11-2019T15:35:29,DarthRexKing,"I just remembered something I thought of, and okay."
01-11-2019T15:35:37,TeapotOfDoom,Me neither but i dont really care
01-11-2019T15:35:48,DarthRexKing,"It was a question concerning the movie but I don't want to spoil, ya'll don't mind?"
01-11-2019T15:36:18,DarthRexKing,Kynum?
01-11-2019T15:36:39,BadFoMo,Kind of like how Stormtroopers are mostly white due to the plastic used for the costumes was hard to paint.
01-11-2019T15:37:20,BadFoMo,...I heard that yesterday.
01-11-2019T15:37:38,DarthRexKing,"Alright, so if Kevin's head was the last remaining part of him, if Ghidorra regenerates from that, does that mean all the heads will be derpy or restored to how he originally was?"
01-11-2019T15:38:10,TeapotOfDoom,Oh i would love them all to be derpy that would be hillarious
01-11-2019T15:38:17,DarthRexKing,.w.
01-11-2019T15:38:23,AnuSekaniArt,Lol
01-11-2019T15:38:23,TeapotOfDoom,I would watch that lol
01-11-2019T15:39:00,DarthRexKing,"There is actually a piece of fan art depicting that and Godzilla being like ""really?"" In the background and that had me thinking. .w."

01-11-2019T15:48:41,TerraTheWizard,babby reni is so adorable :ctwokinds-maddiessparkles:
01-11-2019T15:49:31,IronHorseComics,I wanna give her all the candy
01-11-2019T15:49:54,Ordithus,"No, let's make her teeth good and strong.  Apples!!"
01-11-2019T15:50:27,SageSaga,. . .
01-11-2019T15:50:36,BadFoMo,Hmm?
01-11-2019T15:50:43,SageSaga,shes a dragon- her teeth are probably plenty strong
01-11-2019T15:51:02,Ordithus,Cavities
01-11-2019T15:51:07,IronHorseComics,she could probably eat rocks and not leave a scratch on them
01-11-2019T15:51:27,TeapotOfDoom,also fix teeth with magic?
01-11-2019T15:51:38,Kynum,the ultimate dental plan: magic.
01-11-2019T15:51:59,TeapotOfDoom,that would be the best thing to have as a kid. ALL THE CANDIES \o/
01-11-2019T15:52:42,SageSaga,just hand out healthy nut snacks and things and enchant them to taste like candy
01-11-2019T15:53:07,TeapotOfDoom,even better trick
01-11-2019T15:53:49,BadFoMo,What about Magic Candy that causes no cavities/cleans the teeth?
01-11-2019T15:54:04,BadFoMo,...And ninja-ed again.
01-11-2019T15:54:14,Ordithus,"You think magic is the answer to all problems?  Sure, the mage can teleport the thumb tack out of Fido, but it takes a lifetime of research to teleport only the thumb tack."

01-11-2019T15:57:22,BadFoMo,*Hey! Welcome! Listen! Beware!
01-11-2019T15:59:04,IronHorseComics,or you could just do that to regular vegetables Sage

01-11-2019T16:31:41,SageSaga,i cant decide on what to go as- they wanted something scary- so im not sure which is worse- a republican or a centrist

01-11-2019T16:32:28,BadFoMo,...I was also thing Flat Earther.
01-11-2019T16:32:37,SageSaga,a person who cant decide on being republican or democrat and thus ends up empowering the worse of both
01-11-2019T16:33:05,MarvTheHugPharaoh,That would be a Xeno so go Centrist
