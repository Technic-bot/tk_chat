22-06-2019T18:08:44,vevans0009,"Funny how Nora got the cat form MOSTLY right.  Unlike her ""human"" form."
22-06-2019T18:08:45,IronHorseComics,it's normal for wolves and since Clovis is half wolf he gets it
22-06-2019T18:08:52,Rilea,Having to endure his enemy controlling her new body
22-06-2019T18:09:12,NezumiYuki,"Now imagine Nora neko with Eva Gabor's voice, just like Duchess from Aristocats.... Perfection!"

22-06-2019T18:11:40,vevans0009,And moana.  That animated tatoo what awesome.
22-06-2019T18:11:47,TeapotOfDoom,I saw some random youtuber speculating about the idea of a reboot of Gravity Falls in 3d. He made a 3d model of some caracters. It looked completely aweful
22-06-2019T18:11:51,IronHorseComics,"I remember when Pixar could do no wrong, then Brave came out and won over Wreck-It Ralph"
22-06-2019T18:12:13,vevans0009,Brave looked weird
22-06-2019T18:12:20,IronHorseComics,when Wreck-It was a much better movie
22-06-2019T18:12:52,Sclimshady,Brave was just brother bear but its the mom
22-06-2019T18:12:58,vevans0009,hehe
22-06-2019T18:13:00,vevans0009,True.
22-06-2019T18:13:19,Mippy,I wish Wreck - it was more about its title character though....it seemed like the focus shifted once the annoying princess was introduced
22-06-2019T18:13:33,IronHorseComics,that's Wreck-It Ralph 2
22-06-2019T18:13:41,vevans0009,Glad i did not watch it.
22-06-2019T18:13:43,IronHorseComics,and they betrayed Vinelloppe
22-06-2019T18:13:50,IronHorseComics,her character at least

22-06-2019T18:15:51,unsteddyphoenix,Who could say

22-06-2019T18:16:59,SpazztasticKiwi,while I don’t consider myself a “lady” in that general sense the quote stands
22-06-2019T18:17:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Pretty sure most of the population hasn’t seen it in awhile
22-06-2019T18:17:29,Sclimshady,I still have it on vhs. might pop that in later

22-06-2019T21:50:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"Bagheera, on this visit, was very well behaved despite not liking dogs"
22-06-2019T21:50:51,Ordithus,:ptv-excited:

22-06-2019T21:52:24,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-hearts:
22-06-2019T21:52:47,SpazztasticKiwi,he has been invited back to visit this weekend
22-06-2019T21:52:56,AspiringNoodle,Kitty did good
22-06-2019T21:53:46,SpazztasticKiwi,also it’s Sunday why y’all got alcohol
22-06-2019T21:53:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Shame
22-06-2019T21:53:59,SpazztasticKiwi,dishonor on you
22-06-2019T21:54:03,SpazztasticKiwi,ya family
22-06-2019T21:54:07,SpazztasticKiwi,And ya cow
22-06-2019T21:54:09,Ordithus,Oi
22-06-2019T21:54:19,Ordithus,Don't quote Mulan at me
22-06-2019T21:54:23,Ordithus,I love that movie
22-06-2019T21:54:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Shang is a good male rep
22-06-2019T21:54:43,SpazztasticKiwi,“You fite good”
22-06-2019T21:55:34,AspiringNoodle,"Fuck it, I'm taking all the money I plan to spend on my new computer, and I'm blowing it at the bar"
22-06-2019T21:55:40,AspiringNoodle,Just to spite Kiwi
22-06-2019T21:55:50,Ordithus,This kills the noodle
22-06-2019T21:55:55,SpazztasticKiwi,have fun with the hangover that won’t effect me at all
22-06-2019T21:55:59,AspiringNoodle,*The following day*
22-06-2019T21:56:06,AspiringNoodle,"""Mistakes were maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaade *ded"""
22-06-2019T21:56:20,SpazztasticKiwi,that brings up a good question
22-06-2019T21:56:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Think there’s a recipe that marinates noodles in wine or something to make alcoholic pasta
22-06-2019T21:56:56,SpazztasticKiwi,or would that be gross
22-06-2019T21:57:01,AspiringNoodle,DO IT
22-06-2019T21:57:04,Ordithus,Sounds soggy
22-06-2019T21:57:04,AspiringNoodle,DOOOOO EEEEEEEEEEEEET
22-06-2019T21:57:12,Ordithus,Maybe it cooks off?
22-06-2019T21:57:24,SpazztasticKiwi,“Spaghetti and wine? Why not combine and save time? ‘Murica”
22-06-2019T21:57:25,AspiringNoodle,"I had a pasta at Carabba's recently, mentioned the word Vodka in the sauce"
22-06-2019T21:57:36,AspiringNoodle,"Didn't get me drunk, 0/10 :ptv-snicker:"
22-06-2019T21:57:50,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m talking cook noodles then let them sit in wine for a few hours
22-06-2019T21:57:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Or maybe add it to the sauce
22-06-2019T21:57:57,Ordithus,There is very little vodka in vodka sauce
22-06-2019T21:58:06,SpazztasticKiwi,But I’m thinking it wouldn’t work
22-06-2019T21:58:11,Ordithus,"And the alcohol cooks off, pretty sure"
22-06-2019T21:58:11,AspiringNoodle,Then it is a sauce OF LIES
22-06-2019T21:58:40,Ordithus,"Otherwise you probably couldn't buy the stuff at the grocers, unless they are lies"
22-06-2019T21:58:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Reminds me I helped drive this guy that works at HellMart with me to the realm itself
22-06-2019T21:58:42,AspiringNoodle,Any other peeps see the Child's Play reboot?
22-06-2019T21:59:04,SpazztasticKiwi,it was after my run and he asked me what I meant by grabbing a drink
22-06-2019T21:59:09,AspiringNoodle,Something tells me a few drinks and friends would make the movie extra funny
22-06-2019T21:59:20,SpazztasticKiwi,I meant the sprite I had got from McDonald’s
22-06-2019T21:59:32,AspiringNoodle,xD
22-06-2019T21:59:45,SpazztasticKiwi,He thought I meant a 6 pack or something
22-06-2019T22:00:10,Ordithus,"I get what he was thinking, but he shouldn't be surprised, either"
22-06-2019T22:00:11,SpazztasticKiwi,The way he was talking I wonder if he was asking me to drinks and my brain just pffted
22-06-2019T22:00:32,Ordithus,Gotta hydrate
22-06-2019T22:00:59,SpazztasticKiwi,told me he used to run. Probably stopped cause of work and the fact he walks to it
22-06-2019T22:01:18,SpazztasticKiwi,“That’s enough exercise. No need to be extra”
22-06-2019T22:05:33,SpazztasticKiwi,pssst

22-06-2019T22:13:28,Ordithus,I almost said I didn't get the meme but that fella looked familiar.  But then I got it.
22-06-2019T22:14:15,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d be horrible seeing Mark Tom or anyone that I regularly follow in public
22-06-2019T22:14:27,SpazztasticKiwi,it’d just be me 👀 “is that....”
22-06-2019T22:14:34,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: Is it apliermarker? Markertool? Metalstylus?
22-06-2019T22:14:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Marker Pliers
22-06-2019T22:14:42,Bgrmystr2,I am a confooz

22-06-2019T22:15:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Marker tool works too sometimes
22-06-2019T22:15:18,Bgrmystr2,I knew it
22-06-2019T22:15:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I get some of my terrible humor from watching his bs
22-06-2019T22:16:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Or twitter

22-06-2019T22:22:01,AspiringNoodle,What makes it hilarious is the Jacksepticeye captioned picture :P
22-06-2019T22:22:58,SpazztasticKiwi,if septiplier could die that’d be great
22-06-2019T22:23:23,Bgrmystr2,"lol, the ship between jack and mark? xD"
22-06-2019T22:23:29,SpazztasticKiwi,unfortunately

22-06-2019T22:23:39,Bgrmystr2,just about as funny as all the other ships
22-06-2019T22:23:45,SpazztasticKiwi,oh you clearly don’t know how far some take it
22-06-2019T22:23:49,Bgrmystr2,oh I know
22-06-2019T22:24:21,Bgrmystr2,"I've already seen people do crazy shit, but it's not like that's the only one that has crazy shit done for it"

22-06-2019T22:38:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"If you’re hot, don’t be a youtuber. Just be ugly and talented"
22-06-2019T22:38:44,SpazztasticKiwi,"actually, you can’t be remotely attractive and do anything without being shipped"
22-06-2019T22:39:01,Ordithus,It is the interwebs.  There is no hope
22-06-2019T22:39:18,Bgrmystr2,"Maybe we shouldn't bother with anything, because someone, somewhere, is gonna find you hot. No matter what you look like."
22-06-2019T22:39:24,Bgrmystr2,no exceptions.
22-06-2019T22:39:39,SpazztasticKiwi,nah we’re safe
22-06-2019T22:39:40,Ordithus,I think they learn to deal with it.

22-06-2019T22:39:47,SpazztasticKiwi,🥁

22-06-2019T22:40:27,Bgrmystr2,"like.. we as a people, not we as in us in particular"

22-06-2019T22:48:43,SpazztasticKiwi,even though food
22-06-2019T22:51:10,SpazztasticKiwi,and I know can’t relate is very true. Watched a viner that once asked why girls talk about makeup like they’re military weapon
22-06-2019T22:52:11,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-rose:*[Fully automatic eyeliner]
22-06-2019T22:52:13,AspiringNoodle,"How about them bathroom lines, amirite?"
22-06-2019T22:52:25,AspiringNoodle,"Personally, I never have to deal with them, but apparently they're EVERYWHERE"
22-06-2019T22:52:30,SpazztasticKiwi,"normally you say brand, product, shade/number"
22-06-2019T22:52:48,AspiringNoodle,"Lmao, I'm just imagining makeup wars now xD"
22-06-2019T22:53:06,SpazztasticKiwi,bathroom lines are often due to the buddy system
22-06-2019T22:53:14,SpazztasticKiwi,“never walk alone”
22-06-2019T23:20:34,SpazztasticKiwi,baby oil or vanilla?
22-06-2019T23:20:43,SpazztasticKiwi,smell wise
22-06-2019T23:21:21,AspiringNoodle,Vanilla :ptv-hearts:
22-06-2019T23:22:54,Bgrmystr2,"Baby oil sounds like baby powder, which smells fuckin terrible, so if it's anything remotely similar, then vanilla straight up"
22-06-2019T23:23:05,Ordithus,Lavender
22-06-2019T23:23:43,Bgrmystr2,"To be honest, I wouldn't mind having a candle with the same smell as the Pantene shampoo"
22-06-2019T23:23:49,Bgrmystr2,"good smell, yo"
22-06-2019T23:24:09,AspiringNoodle,My favorite smell: BUFFALO WINGS
22-06-2019T23:24:28,Ordithus,But do you want to smell or smell someone else like buffalo wings
22-06-2019T23:24:42,SpazztasticKiwi,“How to attract men: smell like food”
22-06-2019T23:24:44,AspiringNoodle,"Hmmmm, tough question"
22-06-2019T23:25:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Also lavender is terrible and what is wrong with you baby powder smells great
22-06-2019T23:25:19,Bgrmystr2,I'll pass on food smell
22-06-2019T23:25:26,Bgrmystr2,and wtf baby powder do you use
22-06-2019T23:25:30,Ordithus,Oi flowers are nice
22-06-2019T23:25:44,SpazztasticKiwi,best thing for skin that rubs
22-06-2019T23:26:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Thighs particularly. Or to smell like a powder puff
22-06-2019T23:26:33,SpazztasticKiwi,flowers are nice
22-06-2019T23:26:41,SpazztasticKiwi,lavender is overused
22-06-2019T23:26:57,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d rather smell like a cookie
22-06-2019T23:26:59,Ordithus,"overused can still be nice, but fine"
22-06-2019T23:27:08,Ordithus,again with the food
22-06-2019T23:28:26,AspiringNoodle,loaded fries :D
22-06-2019T23:28:28,SpazztasticKiwi,I have a collection of smell stuff
22-06-2019T23:28:51,Bgrmystr2,"I'm kinda indifferent to lavender, myself."
22-06-2019T23:29:06,SpazztasticKiwi,including a perfume called “sweet crush”
22-06-2019T23:29:14,SpazztasticKiwi,whatever the hell that is
22-06-2019T23:29:23,SpazztasticKiwi,smells like a flower shop
22-06-2019T23:29:32,Bgrmystr2,most flowers smell whatever to me.
22-06-2019T23:30:05,Bgrmystr2,"They look pretty as hell, ofc, but I dunno, the smell is just a whole lotta nothin."
22-06-2019T23:30:30,Ordithus,Depends on the flower.
22-06-2019T23:30:35,Bgrmystr2,I guess
22-06-2019T23:31:01,Bgrmystr2,"I haven't smelled too many, but every one I did smell was very feint smell and wasn't particularly interesting or nice"
22-06-2019T23:32:13,Ordithus,Perhaps you just have a bad sense of smell :ptv-pouty:
22-06-2019T23:33:10,SpazztasticKiwi,I like magnolias
22-06-2019T23:33:33,SpazztasticKiwi,they get just about hand sized and you can smell em down the road
22-06-2019T23:33:51,Ordithus,Don't get those around here
22-06-2019T23:35:01,SpazztasticKiwi,or rather camellias
22-06-2019T23:35:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Both good
22-06-2019T23:35:13,Ordithus,"My lilacs are blooming, can smell those as soon as I get home"
22-06-2019T23:35:15,Ordithus,Not bad
22-06-2019T23:36:15,AspiringNoodle,Finally buying Clip Studio Paint
22-06-2019T23:36:26,AspiringNoodle,Cost is actually 25 USD *mind blown*
22-06-2019T23:38:20,SpazztasticKiwi,both white but I’d like to own a peachy colored rose that supposedly grows in Japan called the junjou romantica
22-06-2019T23:38:27,SpazztasticKiwi,“pure romance”
22-06-2019T23:38:42,SpazztasticKiwi,But it’s also the name of an.....uh..anime
22-06-2019T23:39:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Main thing is I’m looking for a smell for a new leave in conditioner
22-06-2019T23:40:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I did like the honey almond one but it was for Intense Repair™️ and I don’t need anything that heavy metal
22-06-2019T23:47:37,AspiringNoodle,I wonder if settings in CSP are tied to your computer or your account :ptv-wondering:
