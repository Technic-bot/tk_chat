02-04-2019T12:39:53,Dadrobit,"On the plus side, Tom got a nice break this weekend lol."
02-04-2019T12:47:00,TerraTheWizard,first colour stream for a long while i was up until pretty much the end
02-04-2019T12:47:01,TerraTheWizard,lol

02-04-2019T13:06:31,Azumachan,How's going ?
02-04-2019T13:12:28,iliar,"You not doing thing outside of characters morals. So I am curious is suggestion ""Human Nora pole dancing"" allowed?"
02-04-2019T13:12:33,iliar,Actually I don't want suggest this. And I know about legs problem. Just wondering about her moral principles.
02-04-2019T13:12:46,Dadrobit,"Huh, looks like it might be time to update the old password on Patreon methinks. Either Patreon is freaking out and liking most every comment on most every post from Tom, or someone is using my account for seriously benign reasons."
02-04-2019T13:14:06,Dadrobit,"Or at least I think benign, there are no extra pledges anywhere, no extra comments penned under my name, just a boatload of likes on comments all over."
02-04-2019T13:17:55,Twokinds,No it's just a visual bug on Patreon's end as far as I can tel
02-04-2019T13:18:06,Twokinds,Though changing passwords is a good idea every now and then regardless.
02-04-2019T13:18:18,Twokinds,Seemed to be affecting mobile.
02-04-2019T13:21:21,TerraTheWizard,"yeah, i'm getting stuff showing up as liked"
02-04-2019T13:22:08,TerraTheWizard,they done borked something

02-04-2019T13:29:31,iliar,"It's good for me. I do not need to update the bot often. But if one day your cookies are compromised, then the attacker will be able to use your account for a long time."
02-04-2019T13:32:34,Twokinds,That's interesting
02-04-2019T13:33:19,Azumachan,Good to know.
02-04-2019T13:35:17,Dadrobit,"Yeah, honestly it looked like a bug, still updated anyways though, I was using a super old password there from who knows when."
02-04-2019T13:35:32,Azumachan,Yeah same.

02-04-2019T14:05:24,BadFoMo,Sorry.

02-04-2019T14:07:14,Twokinds,It's fixed now

02-04-2019T14:14:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I got a question from left field
02-04-2019T14:17:07,SpazztasticKiwi,You know how some restaurants have signs about braille menus
02-04-2019T14:17:45,SpazztasticKiwi,How do the braille people see this unless the option is written in braille somewhere

02-04-2019T15:32:51,SpazztasticKiwi,I saw that tweet and Tomâ€™s handle with it and it short circuited my brain for a second
02-04-2019T15:33:25,SpazztasticKiwi,cause brain knew something was odd about those two together but I couldnâ€™t figure out what
02-04-2019T15:34:31,SpazztasticKiwi,that and all the skin but the was an afterthought
