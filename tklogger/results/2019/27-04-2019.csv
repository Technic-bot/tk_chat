27-04-2019T00:12:44,SpazztasticKiwi,I love Loki. But IW is next and I know what happens
27-04-2019T02:02:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Watched a vid. Pastor dressed as a homeless man outside his church for a week to test their reactions
27-04-2019T02:03:08,SpazztasticKiwi,If you listen close that noise is something in me shattering
27-04-2019T04:05:35,CrimsonQuill,Plenty of Study for me too (morning)
27-04-2019T04:05:51,CrimsonQuill,I've realised I'm going to spend much of my time in the library.
27-04-2019T04:06:06,CrimsonQuill,"The message to me is...""If you do not study...YOU SHALL NOT PASS!"""
27-04-2019T04:06:25,CrimsonQuill,As for the pastor....
27-04-2019T04:06:31,CrimsonQuill,well...
27-04-2019T04:06:58,CrimsonQuill,It's...
27-04-2019T04:07:09,CrimsonQuill,People. I think I heard that shattering.
27-04-2019T04:07:15,CrimsonQuill,"Anyhow, bye"

27-04-2019T11:43:25,TerraTheWizard,"wow, there is an edgy 12 y/o in the comments"
27-04-2019T11:44:27,Ordithus,Direktor?  I am surprised they haven't been banned
27-04-2019T11:46:12,TerraTheWizard,there isn't a report account button anywhere i can find
27-04-2019T11:47:25,TeapotOfDoom,Director da slav
27-04-2019T11:47:40,TeapotOfDoom,i think the username is expressive enough ^^
27-04-2019T11:48:05,TeapotOfDoom,that guy can't be serious
27-04-2019T11:48:29,TeapotOfDoom,btw hi there!
27-04-2019T11:49:00,TerraTheWizard,the guy follows 2 patreon's
27-04-2019T11:49:03,TerraTheWizard,a slav memes page
27-04-2019T11:49:06,TerraTheWizard,and twokinds
27-04-2019T11:49:18,TerraTheWizard,"and he just spews toxic ""slav memes"" on tk posts"
27-04-2019T11:49:41,TerraTheWizard,which just seem to consist of him saying furries should be executed or something
27-04-2019T11:52:09,TeapotOfDoom,well this is quite ironic considering he follows tk
27-04-2019T11:52:57,TeapotOfDoom,either they're trying their hardest to be edgy or their just think they are funny like that
27-04-2019T11:53:54,TerraTheWizard,12 y/o's don't know the difference between edgelord and funny
27-04-2019T11:54:05,RimaDraws,wow this is crazy
27-04-2019T11:56:03,SpazztasticKiwi,I read that as ‚Äúmade me boobier‚Äù
27-04-2019T11:56:09,TeapotOfDoom,it's so stupid it's nearly funny. they tried being a memelord by posting deus vult
27-04-2019T11:56:15,RimaDraws,i think its pathetic
27-04-2019T11:56:21,TeapotOfDoom,pretty much
27-04-2019T11:57:09,RimaDraws,i think tom needs to ban them
27-04-2019T11:58:12,TeapotOfDoom,"i mean apart from the stuff that's just dumb, commenting to be glad someone's dead (even in a comic) and everyone else should die with them is just not ok"
27-04-2019T11:58:37,TeapotOfDoom,thats way past edgy
27-04-2019T11:59:49,RimaDraws,that is just ban material
27-04-2019T12:00:46,TeapotOfDoom,bring in the mighty ban hammer
27-04-2019T12:00:57,TeapotOfDoom,* bring forth
27-04-2019T12:04:04,TeapotOfDoom,spazz you meen my username?

27-04-2019T12:08:24,TeapotOfDoom,it took me 5 mins to prepare an epic introduction xD
27-04-2019T12:08:36,Ordithus,"The meaning is the same, kiwi"

27-04-2019T12:33:01,CrimsonQuill,And now it looks like she's going to teach her how to use her ability
27-04-2019T12:33:03,CrimsonQuill,:)
27-04-2019T12:33:49,CrimsonQuill,My favourite character'll finally be able to use her magic...

27-04-2019T15:39:03,Bgrmystr2,"If her pawpads do not glow by the end of this, I'm gonna be disappoint lol"
27-04-2019T15:39:31,TeapotOfDoom,doesn't look like they will
27-04-2019T15:39:42,Bgrmystr2,It's still possible
27-04-2019T15:41:07,ZahnHolley,I wish I could use the magic tool for shading.  i need more practice
27-04-2019T15:41:23,FloofyCat,A lot of cyberpunk stuff is indeed not too pretty.
27-04-2019T15:41:50,Xexanoth,...
27-04-2019T15:41:58,Xexanoth,i feel personally insullted by that statement
27-04-2019T15:42:00,FloofyCat,Raine needs a glowing cyberpunk eye though \o/
27-04-2019T15:42:10,Xexanoth,cyberpunk stuff is pretty AF
27-04-2019T15:42:13,FloofyCat,Nah I mean Cyberpunk 2020/2077 as in that not the genre itself.
27-04-2019T15:42:19,Bgrmystr2,"cyberpunk has a huge reliance on glowy neon, signs, and such"
27-04-2019T15:42:21,Xexanoth,ooohh
27-04-2019T15:42:23,Xexanoth,ok i see
27-04-2019T15:43:07,FloofyCat,"Yeah those are kinda the dystopian cyberpunk things, the genre itself, well, can be whatever. It's future, people probably have mini roof gardens and stuff."
27-04-2019T15:43:59,Bgrmystr2,"Also, after looking up both titles, you are absolutely incorrect Floofy"
27-04-2019T15:44:22,Bgrmystr2,because both of them are still pretty despite the punk nature of the genre
27-04-2019T15:44:49,CrimsonQuill,Back for a short bit
27-04-2019T15:44:57,Sclimshady,wb
27-04-2019T15:45:21,CrimsonQuill,Just want to see how this is coming before I sleep

27-04-2019T15:45:54,HMM265,Paper  mache chair    yellow trash can.      Ice flawfored chicken.  Upside-down chair.    Pink refrigerated.    Green bean flavored koolaid
27-04-2019T15:45:56,CrimsonQuill,hullo Grishnark
27-04-2019T15:45:57,Sclimshady,"It's Raine, so it's coming along great"
27-04-2019T15:46:15,CrimsonQuill,She looks awesome.
27-04-2019T15:46:41,Sclimshady,:ctwokinds-nibsdance:
27-04-2019T15:47:03,CrimsonQuill,"By the way, did anyone get Detroit-Become Human vibes from the circle in the corner of the sketch?"
27-04-2019T15:47:27,Sclimshady,"Kinda, yeah"
27-04-2019T15:47:39,Mippy,bACK
27-04-2019T15:47:39,TeapotOfDoom,I am Connor

27-04-2019T15:48:32,CrimsonQuill,"""Hello Lieutenant. My name is Connor. I'm the Android sent by Cyberlife."""
27-04-2019T15:48:54,FloofyCat,Unpopular opinion: Detroit: Become Human was garbage.
27-04-2019T15:49:07,Combak,"Floofy, that's a popular opinion."
27-04-2019T15:49:13,CrimsonQuill,I liked Connor's story best.
27-04-2019T15:49:13,FloofyCat,Oh... well good!
27-04-2019T15:49:19,Bgrmystr2,is it really though?
27-04-2019T15:49:20,CrimsonQuill,The music was awesome.
27-04-2019T15:49:22,beid,yea it was full of questionable handling of sensitive issues at best
27-04-2019T15:49:26,Xexanoth,"honestly it reminds me more of ""Remember, Me"" or whatever that game was called"
27-04-2019T15:49:28,CrimsonQuill,It does have some failings.
27-04-2019T15:49:33,FloofyCat,Well it wasn't about androids that's my problem
27-04-2019T15:49:39,CrimsonQuill,"That being said, it was ambitious.."
27-04-2019T15:49:48,TeapotOfDoom,I think it was really well executed in the way that there were really different endings that yould be reached
27-04-2019T15:49:49,CrimsonQuill,And I have to say I liked the story chart
27-04-2019T15:49:58,CrimsonQuill,Any choice mattered.
27-04-2019T15:50:01,Bgrmystr2,Considering it all came from a concept youtube video..
27-04-2019T15:50:04,HMM265,8-9 20-8-5-18-5 6-18-9-5-14-4
27-04-2019T15:50:08,Bgrmystr2,I think it came out really well
27-04-2019T15:50:08,FloofyCat,Detroit: We ripped of Data from Star Trek but cheaper and not as good as Data.
27-04-2019T15:50:11,Bgrmystr2,can you not numbers?
27-04-2019T15:50:12,FloofyCat,^ Would've been amazing
27-04-2019T15:50:18,beid,"and coming from the kind of dude who says stuff akin to ""i have black/(insert whatever) friends my work can't have diversity issues"""
27-04-2019T15:50:23,beid,so :/
27-04-2019T15:50:29,Sclimshady,I think thats a bot
27-04-2019T15:50:41,beid,funny timing
27-04-2019T15:51:07,Bgrmystr2,nope
27-04-2019T15:51:08,Twokinds,Cat wants good brb
27-04-2019T15:51:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Yea. Bunch of numbers. We speak English not code
27-04-2019T15:51:11,Bgrmystr2,shows as normal person
27-04-2019T15:51:13,CrimsonQuill,"I am looking at this image, and have only just realised that that cable...plugs into her head."
27-04-2019T15:51:20,beid,understandable go give cat good
27-04-2019T15:51:22,FloofyCat,Good wha?!
27-04-2019T15:51:27,CrimsonQuill,Cat needs stroke
27-04-2019T15:51:33,CrimsonQuill,Cats are nice.
27-04-2019T15:51:36,Sclimshady,"Wierd, theyve been posting strange stuff"
27-04-2019T15:51:44,Bgrmystr2,Picarto has a specific icon for bot accounts
27-04-2019T15:51:44,FloofyCat,Cat requires ten units of pat.
27-04-2019T15:51:51,Bgrmystr2,they don't have that icon
27-04-2019T15:52:01,TeapotOfDoom,What if I only have 9?
27-04-2019T15:52:04,beid,i dont think they were saying it was like. a sanctioned bot
27-04-2019T15:52:11,FloofyCat,Then 1 pat will be taken from you
27-04-2019T15:52:18,TeapotOfDoom,Oh no!
27-04-2019T15:52:21,Bgrmystr2,"that's not how the accounts work, beid XD"
27-04-2019T15:52:43,TeapotOfDoom,Or does the cat owe me the one pet then?
27-04-2019T15:52:47,beid,how would it not? if picarto could identify bots that like that they'd get banned
27-04-2019T15:52:52,TeapotOfDoom,Is there interest on pets?
27-04-2019T15:52:54,HMM265,The numbers make a sentence
27-04-2019T15:53:02,Bgrmystr2,"bots are not illegal on the site, firstoff"
27-04-2019T15:53:04,beid,alright not bot
27-04-2019T15:53:04,Bgrmystr2,so no they would not
27-04-2019T15:53:08,FloofyCat,No you'll just be in debt on one pat and the interest rate is 10% weekly on pats.
27-04-2019T15:53:10,beid,thought they meant they were a spambot
27-04-2019T15:53:21,FloofyCat,Compound interest as well.
27-04-2019T15:53:22,CrimsonQuill,WOAH.
27-04-2019T15:53:25,TeapotOfDoom,Sounds fair
27-04-2019T15:53:28,CrimsonQuill,How did you do that TOm?
27-04-2019T15:53:37,FloofyCat,Wait do wha? I was looking at chat
27-04-2019T15:53:40,Bgrmystr2,"and secondly, there's ways to activate bot stuff on any account."
27-04-2019T15:53:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Technology
27-04-2019T15:53:45,CrimsonQuill,The whole shading thing.
27-04-2019T15:53:45,TeapotOfDoom,If I overpet is there repayment?
27-04-2019T15:53:50,beid,well yeah that's what i'm saying
27-04-2019T15:53:51,Bgrmystr2,there's no alternative account thing
27-04-2019T15:54:00,Sclimshady,Were apparently creating a pat black market now
27-04-2019T15:54:00,CrimsonQuill,"Once I am good at drawing, I must master photoshop."
27-04-2019T15:54:10,NibblyBot,Ban me?
27-04-2019T15:54:11,FloofyCat,Shading the entire thing or just one part of something?
27-04-2019T15:54:17,beid,"i was under the impression the person saying they were a bot meant it was a spambot, not like. a proper chatbot meant to be in here"
27-04-2019T15:54:23,Bgrmystr2,No nibblybot you will not be banned
27-04-2019T15:54:27,Sclimshady,Now weve offended nibbs

27-04-2019T16:06:03,TeapotOfDoom,well i see no problem there since hdmi is capable of carrying ethernet but i have not seen a single implementation to date that actually works
27-04-2019T16:06:08,Xexanoth,though it might depend on what cyberpunk fiction you're from exactly
27-04-2019T16:06:16,CrimsonQuill,Thanks Xexanoth
27-04-2019T16:06:18,MviluUatusun,"Xexa, that would explain her being pixilated."
27-04-2019T16:06:22,SpazztasticKiwi,I just imagine a tiny man sprinting along cyber lines
27-04-2019T16:06:27,Xexanoth,But that's one of the great things about cyberpunk

27-04-2019T16:17:21,TeapotOfDoom,I m waiting for the day you can just upload music to your brain. or pdfs
27-04-2019T16:17:32,FloofyCat,We'll be long dead before that
27-04-2019T16:17:38,Bgrmystr2,you think so
27-04-2019T16:17:41,TeapotOfDoom,Elon thinks otherwise
27-04-2019T16:17:43,Bgrmystr2,but you'd be surprised
27-04-2019T16:17:56,FloofyCat,"Yeah, psychology is very limited at the moment."
27-04-2019T16:18:29,Bgrmystr2,"maybe that is, but science is more understanding how the brain sends and recieves signals"
27-04-2019T16:18:36,TeapotOfDoom,Neuronal interfaces are a long way from perfect but i have already seen and tried already working implementations
27-04-2019T16:18:46,FloofyCat,"No one knows how to actually solve things like clinical depression, the current approach is ""Urrhm just... like take these things it MIGHT work?"""
27-04-2019T16:18:59,Bgrmystr2,"people missing limbs can use neural interfaces to control limbs like they never lost one. It's not perfect, but it's VERY good."
27-04-2019T16:19:13,FloofyCat,In some basic sense but translating impulses is a much easier task than uploading a book or something.
27-04-2019T16:19:28,TeapotOfDoom,Jup just about to say
27-04-2019T16:19:52,FloofyCat,Because people already know what nerve impulses are and how they work.
27-04-2019T16:19:52,Bgrmystr2,"lol, translation is the first step to speaking"
27-04-2019T16:20:00,TeapotOfDoom,If we are talking about it like a traditional file system i think the first think we will be able to read
27-04-2019T16:20:03,FloofyCat,No one really knows how memory actually works.
27-04-2019T16:20:05,Bgrmystr2,you have to understand a language before you can try to communicate
27-04-2019T16:20:37,MviluUatusun,"Well, unless you're trying to learn the langauge, Bgr.  But, it does help to have a common ground."
27-04-2019T16:21:05,Bgrmystr2,and that's what I'm saying. Science is trying to learn the language. Learn how the electrical signals in the brain function
27-04-2019T16:21:09,TeapotOfDoom,brain implant anyone?
27-04-2019T16:21:12,Bgrmystr2,so it can send them and recieve them
27-04-2019T16:21:16,Bgrmystr2,"no need for that, teapot"

27-04-2019T16:23:37,Sclimshady,Probably because that is easier to get funding for

27-04-2019T16:35:28,Bgrmystr2,considering the fact that they still use magnetic tape for storage
27-04-2019T16:35:30,FloofyCat,I wonder what future 'high definition' is. Ultra-Super-Duper  High Definition

27-04-2019T16:35:40,Ordithus,Used to be we kept movies on big rolls of many many transparent tiny pictures in sequence

27-04-2019T16:36:09,TeapotOfDoom,At least the Empire strikes back
27-04-2019T16:36:14,FloofyCat,A monster.
27-04-2019T16:36:15,TeapotOfDoom,The player struck last
27-04-2019T16:36:15,MviluUatusun,"Ooh.  Now you're going old school, Floofy."
27-04-2019T16:36:22,Sclimshady,"Shoot, I still use casettes in my car"
27-04-2019T16:36:35,FloofyCat,3.5 inch floppy disks for your Commodore Amiga
27-04-2019T16:36:44,MviluUatusun,My mom's car has a cassette player.  No tapes but a player.
27-04-2019T16:36:56,IronHorseComics,I found a third party app that lets me play DVDs on my computer

27-04-2019T16:37:26,IronHorseComics,"yeah, thanks Windows 10"
27-04-2019T16:37:29,Snowdayzz,My grandmothers 05 subaru had a cassette player
27-04-2019T16:37:42,TeapotOfDoom,Best thing I've ever seen is an AUX to casette adapter
27-04-2019T16:37:54,TeapotOfDoom,Came in really useful in my bathroom radio
27-04-2019T16:37:58,Sclimshady,"Well if this is gonna be a competition, my truck uses 8 tracks"
27-04-2019T16:38:09,IronHorseComics,Microsoft has done a half-baked DVD playing app for $15 on something that should be natural

27-04-2019T16:38:22,Sclimshady,I definitely have that teapot
27-04-2019T16:38:36,Sclimshady,It was cheap
27-04-2019T16:38:37,TeapotOfDoom,Microsoft managed to get sued over their zip implementation
27-04-2019T16:39:03,TeapotOfDoom,@Sclimshady It's amazing!
27-04-2019T16:39:09,IronHorseComics,the 3rd party app I'm using is called VLC Media player

27-04-2019T16:41:07,Ordithus,Aren't blu ray drives still $$$ for some weird reason?
27-04-2019T16:41:25,TeapotOfDoom,Yep they're multilayer
27-04-2019T16:41:30,CrRAR,Blue lasers probably still be expensive
27-04-2019T16:41:33,Snowdayzz,"Uh oh, cat in heat again..."
27-04-2019T16:41:37,TeapotOfDoom,that's why they are so expensive
27-04-2019T16:41:46,Ordithus,DVDs are multilayer though
27-04-2019T16:41:49,CrRAR,...and licensing cost for the technology too probably.
27-04-2019T16:41:53,TeapotOfDoom,yep
27-04-2019T16:42:00,TeapotOfDoom,DVD are multilayer?
27-04-2019T16:42:03,CrRAR,yeah
27-04-2019T16:42:06,Ordithus,Typically two
27-04-2019T16:42:10,Ordithus,Blu ray is often 3

27-04-2019T16:42:52,IronHorseComics,gimmie a price
27-04-2019T16:43:05,FloofyCat,4k Blu Rays is where its at.
27-04-2019T16:43:06,Ordithus,A microsd card can hold more anyways
27-04-2019T16:43:35,CrRAR,"Blue lasers allow for writing smaller ""pits and lands"" on the disc surface resulting in more data per sq inch."
27-04-2019T16:43:35,IronHorseComics,I still need to have my new graphics card installed and replace one of my monitors with an IPS one
27-04-2019T16:43:45,TeapotOfDoom,Online streaming can never beat the bitrate of local media. It would just crush any data connection
27-04-2019T16:44:00,FloofyCat,You gotta have insane amounts of DRM and spend 20+ hours figuring out how to legally watch it or its not worth it.
27-04-2019T16:44:01,CrRAR,"Yeah compression be sucky, yo"

27-04-2019T17:00:39,NeonMitsumi,@TeapotOfDoom Lead is garbage though.
27-04-2019T17:01:22,TeapotOfDoom,The mixdown is mushy in generall
27-04-2019T17:02:07,NeonMitsumi,"Yep. YouTube quality isn't the greatest, but their other tracks aren't too impressive either."
27-04-2019T17:02:26,TeapotOfDoom,but non the less it reminds me of 2015 bigroom which is nice
27-04-2019T17:03:09,TeapotOfDoom,I just love the classical khsmr long riser 01 effect before the drop. It's such a heavy kliche at this point
27-04-2019T17:03:18,NeonMitsumi,"Well, it is from 2015. But there are much better tracks from that era."
27-04-2019T17:03:29,Serja,This OST is giving me feels :sob:

27-04-2019T17:03:56,Serja,I'm just mostly lurking and working on art myself. It's nice to draw while others do.
27-04-2019T17:04:21,Serja,Tom is a huge inspiration to me and one of the reasons I decided to make a comic myself for my story :D
27-04-2019T17:04:35,TeapotOfDoom,hardwell - earthquake. newer but nice
27-04-2019T17:04:53,TeapotOfDoom,that track has its name for a reason
27-04-2019T17:05:13,NeonMitsumi,"Earthquake is pretty bad as well, tbh. Hardwell has been going downhill for a while. However collabs with KAAZE are a beauty."
27-04-2019T17:05:43,NeonMitsumi,Vocal in Earthquake is great though.

27-04-2019T17:07:04,TeapotOfDoom,pure party track
27-04-2019T17:07:07,Ordithus,Interesting to watch Tom work on a city night scene
27-04-2019T17:07:16,FloofyCat,^ It is indeed
27-04-2019T17:07:22,FloofyCat,The sketch of it was pretty fun to watch
27-04-2019T17:07:25,Serja,Yeah
27-04-2019T17:07:29,NeonMitsumi,The melody is the most generic thing ever. Like Maddix's Zero.
27-04-2019T17:07:31,Serja,I like it
27-04-2019T17:08:07,TeapotOfDoom,Well you could debate if that would be the point of the whole genre ^^
27-04-2019T17:08:24,FloofyCat,I wonder how good it'll look if we give Tom twice the pixel size and the entire stream to colour just one thing and see how detailed it gets
27-04-2019T17:08:33,NeonMitsumi,"Fair enough, but there are some brilliant tracks."
27-04-2019T17:08:47,MviluUatusun,Okay.  I'm back for about 10 minutes.

27-04-2019T17:10:38,NeonMitsumi,Tough choice... But I think I'd have to go with Immortal from DVBBS and Tony Junior.

27-04-2019T17:14:04,RimaDraws,good point
27-04-2019T17:14:04,TeapotOfDoom,"Depends tbh. I have a 4 hour playlist with only bigroom. All time favourites would be Garrix - Helicopter, Hardwell - Run Wild, whos in the house and earthquake"

27-04-2019T17:16:05,TeapotOfDoom,totally. i saw a really small club show about a year ago just before ultra and he tested like 7 completely new tracks
27-04-2019T17:16:16,TeapotOfDoom,that show was a banger
27-04-2019T17:16:18,Bgrmystr2,Apartments have generators usually.

27-04-2019T17:17:00,FloofyCat,"Because burglars would go cut the power that would trigger the alarms, but also the whole power cut kinda does the same thing"

27-04-2019T17:18:21,NeonMitsumi,I find the Anthem lead too mono for my taste.
27-04-2019T17:18:31,Bgrmystr2,Where I used to live had that. A normal residential street but across the street was a totally different power grid.
27-04-2019T17:18:33,FloofyCat,PAW COLAAAAA :D
27-04-2019T17:19:16,TeapotOfDoom,It just screams aoki
27-04-2019T17:19:27,TeapotOfDoom,not my fav tbh
27-04-2019T17:19:37,NeonMitsumi,Can't blame you.
27-04-2019T17:19:43,FloofyCat,"Thank you Tom, Paw Cola is 10/10"

27-04-2019T17:21:43,SpinoSpiritNinja,Hello humans/not humans
27-04-2019T17:21:43,FloofyCat,I wonder what TK pepsi is
27-04-2019T17:21:52,FloofyCat,Paw Cola seems more like Coca Cola
27-04-2019T17:22:00,TeapotOfDoom,"i just looked it up. New tracks were anthem, unity, everytime we touch and shine a light"
27-04-2019T17:22:09,NeonMitsumi,@FloofyCat Pupsi
27-04-2019T17:22:10,TeapotOfDoom,so all of them are out by now
27-04-2019T17:22:20,RimaDraws,it has the same label as pepsi tho
27-04-2019T17:22:25,NeonMitsumi,Shine a Light is <3
27-04-2019T17:22:26,FloofyCat,In before PEPSICO‚Ñ¢ conglomerate in TK universe starts to own a small portion of the market.
27-04-2019T17:22:28,RimaDraws,so pawpsi
27-04-2019T17:22:32,NeonMitsumi,Unity is absolute garbage.
27-04-2019T17:22:46,TeapotOfDoom,totally
27-04-2019T17:23:06,NeonMitsumi,Everyone needs to fuck off with that bandpassed lead already.
27-04-2019T17:23:13,TeapotOfDoom,i think it' part of the deal why he was allowed to play at tomorrowland again
27-04-2019T17:23:38,NeonMitsumi,I mean... I can't blame him there. I would do the same then.
27-04-2019T17:24:04,RimaDraws,uh...

27-04-2019T17:25:03,TeapotOfDoom,yeah so i don't complain. but i don't like vegas and mikes music anyway. it sounds so bland to me
27-04-2019T17:25:50,TeapotOfDoom,hardwell did a facetime with wildstylez while on the decks playing shine a light. that was fun
27-04-2019T17:26:12,CrRAR,lol Just had a thought...

27-04-2019T17:31:12,IronHorseComics,"well, he's from Ohio so that narrows things down a lot"
27-04-2019T17:31:20,NeonMitsumi,White wolf.

27-04-2019T17:33:32,TeapotOfDoom,@NeonMitsumi how do you come up with the assumption that he would be a white wolf?

27-04-2019T17:34:18,FloofyCat,Sprite? May as well just drink water at that point.
27-04-2019T17:34:35,TeapotOfDoom,That settles two for one
27-04-2019T17:34:47,FloofyCat,Also coca cola is technically a spiced citrus fruit drink.
27-04-2019T17:34:57,Mippy,Ooooo Like grape soda:ctwokinds-rainehappy:
27-04-2019T17:35:16,FloofyCat,That emote is very ^ adorable.

27-04-2019T17:40:57,tehbear,most sugarfree sodas taste like dishwasher liquid

27-04-2019T21:00:32,FloofyCat,What ya' going to ask for?
27-04-2019T21:00:48,Bgrmystr2,did you have any ideas of what you were originally going to ask for?
27-04-2019T21:00:57,Bgrmystr2,"since you picked it, you had to have intended to ask for something."
27-04-2019T21:01:08,FloofyCat,Is it sketched and coloured also?
27-04-2019T21:01:13,SamuelLeumas,At the time I was trying to decide on a few ideas involving flora
27-04-2019T21:01:18,Mippy,It better be adorable *shakes fist*

27-04-2019T21:10:29,FloofyCat,"It's not even comparable, usually 30-35 Celsius."
27-04-2019T21:10:30,unsteddyphoenix,If it has no sun it sounds pretty good
27-04-2019T21:10:38,Mippy,Britain sounds good to me

27-04-2019T21:11:56,Twokinds,I dunno Brittain seems like to a nice place.

27-04-2019T21:17:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Ethan once covered that. One day he had to delay a video because he couldn‚Äôt record normal time as his neighbors were very loudly getting their freak on
27-04-2019T21:17:19,CrRAR,The bst townhomes share the garage wall with the neighbor .
27-04-2019T21:17:20,BadFoMo,@SamuelLeumas Mippy and Muddy.

27-04-2019T21:18:37,ProsePro7,I miss the country we dont even share streets with people some times
27-04-2019T21:18:53,FloofyCat,It all rests in finding a full time job that pays even half-decent.
27-04-2019T21:19:01,Sclimshady,Thats the best Prose
27-04-2019T21:19:03,Twokinds,That's my dream!
27-04-2019T21:19:07,FloofyCat,Otherwise it's sharing a house with people.
27-04-2019T21:19:10,RimaDraws,i know one item in that store i want. gonna save up the money to get it

27-04-2019T21:19:48,ProsePro7,Well you share it with cow and horse pastures but the next house is like half a mile to a mile down the road
27-04-2019T21:19:51,unsteddyphoenix,One of my goals atm is just to live alone
27-04-2019T21:19:57,FloofyCat,^ yup.

27-04-2019T21:20:23,unsteddyphoenix,hey man
27-04-2019T21:20:24,Taremong,Farewell. This is awesome Tom.
27-04-2019T21:20:31,FloofyCat,My goal is to not share a house with someone.
27-04-2019T21:20:37,ProsePro7,Welcome to Kansas...build a basement
27-04-2019T21:20:38,FloofyCat,My second goal is to not be in an apartment
27-04-2019T21:20:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Travel the nation. Tour each state. Pick the one you like and move
27-04-2019T21:20:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Totally that easy
27-04-2019T21:21:09,FloofyCat,I wish we had basements in the UK.
27-04-2019T21:21:24,swack24,woo human kitties
27-04-2019T21:21:25,Sclimshady,"Im in a weird spot in Kansas that doesnt get tornadoes, they just miss us"
27-04-2019T21:21:29,FloofyCat,Even just a single room as a basement...
27-04-2019T21:21:35,ThorburnCreative,"now you mention it, why don't we?"
27-04-2019T21:21:39,ProsePro7,Its even easier than that move where the weather sucks that is usually where there is a lot of land
27-04-2019T21:21:40,FloofyCat,"Oh yeah that's one bonus about the UK, temperate weather means no tornadoes."
27-04-2019T21:22:03,Mippy,Basements are overrated
27-04-2019T21:22:03,FloofyCat,The closest thing to a natural disaster in the UK is a few inches of a snow that somehow shuts down half of the trains in the country.
27-04-2019T21:22:16,CrRAR,I heard Montana is really beautiful.
27-04-2019T21:22:17,Muddy,My goal is to sell one old house and buy a new one.
27-04-2019T21:22:19,ProsePro7,UK gets them there just more like dust devils and not the F5 finger of God that the States get
27-04-2019T21:22:20,FloofyCat,They're overrated if you already have space Mippy
27-04-2019T21:22:34,SamuelLeumas,A basement transformed into a cinema theatre would be great... maybe
27-04-2019T21:22:34,Sclimshady,"Try an inch of ice coating the road Floofy, thats what we get here"
27-04-2019T21:22:44,Mippy,I‚Äôve never had use for one

27-04-2019T21:44:46,FloofyCat,Sunday ones are much easier to catch.
27-04-2019T21:45:10,FloofyCat,Hopefully once uni ends and I'm in full time work I won't have to miss the Sunday streams.
27-04-2019T21:45:11,Xerenowicz,The friday ones would be for me... ~3 AM - ~9 AM
27-04-2019T21:46:05,FloofyCat,2am for me.
27-04-2019T21:46:45,FloofyCat,If I end up working weekdays only I'll be able to sleep a lot Sunday morning to catch all of Sunday and stay up for mast of Friday morning to catch that

27-04-2019T22:42:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I do work with a guy who‚Äôs deaf and there‚Äôs this lady that comes in with her husband who‚Äôs deaf
27-04-2019T22:43:02,SpazztasticKiwi,"They‚Äôre always walking around with each other, signing. Sometimes you‚Äôll catch what has to be a fight because their hands just get faster and faster. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt yell at me - use your inside hands‚Äù kinda thing"
27-04-2019T22:43:15,RimaDraws,LOL
27-04-2019T22:49:22,Bgrmystr2,haha
27-04-2019T22:49:49,Bgrmystr2,as if there's a difference between hands when you're inside or outside xD

27-04-2019T22:54:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"Adorable is this really old couple that always walks each other inside, around the building, and back put"
27-04-2019T22:54:57,SpazztasticKiwi,holding arms the entire time
27-04-2019T22:55:32,SpazztasticKiwi,They‚Äôre like 80s or somesuch
27-04-2019T22:55:42,CrRAR,"You know it's serious between the signing couple when one of them does that Rose two-fingered ""watching you"" gesture to the other."
27-04-2019T22:55:57,RimaDraws,LOL
27-04-2019T22:56:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Hey I‚Äôd do that and I‚Äôm not deaf

27-04-2019T22:56:55,SpazztasticKiwi,As soon as I leave the room? Crash
27-04-2019T22:57:05,CrRAR,"""Calm down you little shit if you intend on keeping ALL your nine lives."""
27-04-2019T22:57:07,RimaDraws,i know mine understands me
27-04-2019T22:57:35,RimaDraws,"like if i tell him to get off the table like ""get down"" and snap my fingers at him to go to the floor he goes down"
27-04-2019T22:57:43,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúNo Bagheera‚Äù *protesting mew* ‚ÄúI said no‚Äù *longer protesting mew*
27-04-2019T22:58:20,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúDon‚Äôt backtalk me. The answer is no‚Äù *louder longer protesting mew*
27-04-2019T22:58:28,CrRAR,haha

27-04-2019T23:09:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I see him running somewhere and my immediate question is what did you do
27-04-2019T23:09:59,SpazztasticKiwi,And he‚Äôs got the gall to look at me like ‚Äúwhy u so distrustful‚Äù
27-04-2019T23:10:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Should‚Äôve named him Loki
27-04-2019T23:10:20,Bgrmystr2,cuz cats are untrustworthy :ptv-pouty:
27-04-2019T23:12:04,Ordithus,Bagheera's got a reputation
27-04-2019T23:12:26,SpazztasticKiwi,He‚Äôs a fuzzy lil attention sponge yet very jealous and just about as mischievous as possible
27-04-2019T23:12:57,SpazztasticKiwi,And he‚Äôs smart. Which makes it worse most often
27-04-2019T23:40:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Imagine this is my black cat https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/524825976597643265/572280823751901230/image0.jpg

27-04-2019T23:41:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I posted all that shoe discussing linkage and you never said anything
27-04-2019T23:41:22,Bgrmystr2,discipline them all so they can go back to being lazy squishies that don't cause problems and don't do anything really at all.
27-04-2019T23:41:35,Bgrmystr2,yeah well
27-04-2019T23:41:45,Bgrmystr2,I FORGOT OKAY I'M SORRY :ptv-pouty:
27-04-2019T23:45:40,SpazztasticKiwi,This might make you feel smarter https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/524825976597643265/572282237744054272/image0.jpg
27-04-2019T23:47:53,Bgrmystr2,noooooooo don't show me these links Dxxxx
27-04-2019T23:48:01,Bgrmystr2,Is that china
27-04-2019T23:48:05,Bgrmystr2,that's probably china.
27-04-2019T23:49:08,SpazztasticKiwi,I want to believe that tiny red string at his waits is some attempt at a safety cord but
27-04-2019T23:49:27,Bgrmystr2,it's not a safty cord
27-04-2019T23:49:32,Bgrmystr2,..safety* even
27-04-2019T23:49:40,Bgrmystr2,cuz it won't save him from anything
27-04-2019T23:49:50,Bgrmystr2,it's not gonna stop him from falling in the water
27-04-2019T23:50:03,Bgrmystr2,and won't stop him from drifting away till the cable reaches it's length
27-04-2019T23:50:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Well I hope he can swim then. Provided that water is deep enough
27-04-2019T23:50:23,Bgrmystr2,"and if it reaches length before he falls, then he'll just swing towards the shore and smack the groun instead."
27-04-2019T23:50:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Otherwise splat
27-04-2019T23:50:56,Bgrmystr2,"yeah he's gonna probably splat either way if he falls. I dunno why the fuck they're not just,.. using the bucket."
27-04-2019T23:51:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I see people do stuff like that and a little part of me dies
27-04-2019T23:51:50,Bgrmystr2,"there's very little safety requirements for many countries, china is one of the worst"
27-04-2019T23:51:58,Bgrmystr2,but people do that dumb shit anywhere
27-04-2019T23:52:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Mainly because I hate heights. But also because I know that while it‚Äôs stupid they‚Äôre most likely to survive and have the ability to reproduce
27-04-2019T23:53:31,Bgrmystr2,part of me is angry that people would want to protect such stupidity and then proceed to teach such stupidity to their kids.. repeating the cycle
27-04-2019T23:53:32,SpazztasticKiwi,That reminds me I wish mippy was here because of Marks last upload
27-04-2019T23:54:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Not implying Mark is stupid it‚Äôs just he has his moments of course
27-04-2019T23:54:19,Bgrmystr2,"but then I'm also mad for the opposite reason.. we shouldn't need to get rid of people just cuz they're stupid, they just need to stop being dumb, yeah? But how the hell do you fix it"
