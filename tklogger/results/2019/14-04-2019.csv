14-04-2019T13:59:41,SpazztasticKiwi,notre dame is in flames. a spire has already collapsed
14-04-2019T14:00:00,SpazztasticKiwi,but they are reporting less smoke
14-04-2019T14:04:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Only cause I‚Äôve come across was a burning trash can started it
14-04-2019T15:35:23,Bgrmystr2,sad times.

14-04-2019T15:39:23,BadFoMo,I think I heard that they moved the copper statues (I don't really know anything much about the place) before the fire; so there's that?
14-04-2019T15:44:24,Bgrmystr2,yeah they were doing some work on the spire itself
14-04-2019T15:49:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Heard about the work on it
14-04-2019T16:09:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Se√°n‚Äôs brother Malcolm was who I saw it from. Se√°n retweeted his picture

14-04-2019T18:34:09,CrRAR,It reminds me of something that would have inspired the Ewoks from Star Wars.
14-04-2019T18:34:24,SpazztasticKiwi,"in other news, a prehistoric bee thought to be extinct is supposedly still alive"
14-04-2019T18:34:53,CrRAR,Is that what all the buzz is about!?

14-04-2019T18:52:13,SpazztasticKiwi,The consent condom. The only condom in the world that requires two people (4 hands) to open with two buttons on top and two on the bottom
14-04-2019T18:53:07,SpazztasticKiwi,"because when I think of someone who‚Äôs not worried about consent, I know he‚Äôs definitely worried about using a condom"

14-04-2019T19:16:00,Bgrmystr2,cuz that would make them super dangrous
14-04-2019T19:16:17,CrRAR,"Yeah, consensus on the bee is no beuno."

14-04-2019T19:17:18,CrRAR,Could become a deformed freak from that thing.
14-04-2019T19:18:34,SpazztasticKiwi,What I read said the photographers had been out looking and of course got a picture
14-04-2019T19:19:02,SpazztasticKiwi,"But thing is, are they just bee photographers, wildlife photographers"
14-04-2019T19:19:13,CrRAR,MAYBE the emergence of the bees is related to the appearance of the dwarf doggos.
14-04-2019T19:19:18,CrRAR,Maybe they CREATE dwarf doggos~
14-04-2019T19:19:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Did they have bee suits on or a x1000 feet zoom lenses or something
14-04-2019T19:19:46,CrRAR,maybe both
14-04-2019T19:19:48,CrRAR,sounds logical

14-04-2019T19:21:10,Bgrmystr2,does not look like he had bee suit at all
14-04-2019T19:22:04,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúFeeds on nectar and pollen‚Äù you‚Äôre trying to tell me this abomination is a goth honeybee
14-04-2019T19:22:23,CrRAR,You can buy one on EBAY!?

14-04-2019T19:23:28,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-clovischuckle:
14-04-2019T19:24:15,Bgrmystr2,and then your enemies make the bees their pets
14-04-2019T19:24:44,Bgrmystr2,and the children of those pets will be much more ferocious and deadly and they will attack you with them.
14-04-2019T19:24:46,Bgrmystr2,Probably.
14-04-2019T19:24:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Says they‚Äôre trying to push to change their conservation status
14-04-2019T19:25:05,Bgrmystr2,yeah
14-04-2019T19:25:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Small range. Thought to have been extinct till now. Rarely found and calm temper yeah
14-04-2019T19:25:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Goth honeybee
14-04-2019T19:25:26,Bgrmystr2,"if that's the only place in the world they're at and thought were extinct, then yeah they should be endangered off the bat."
14-04-2019T19:26:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Close off sales now before they become established where they shouldn‚Äôt
14-04-2019T19:26:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Chill or not they live where they live for a reason
14-04-2019T19:26:33,Bgrmystr2,also before sales make them actually go extinct.
14-04-2019T19:26:51,CrRAR,"Yeah, don't let them mingle the prehistoric bee with rambunctious africanized bees."
14-04-2019T19:27:01,CrRAR,We'll ALL have a bad time.
14-04-2019T19:27:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Who knows if other climates would agree too well with them

14-04-2019T19:27:21,SpazztasticKiwi,They look bigger than African bees
14-04-2019T19:27:47,Bgrmystr2,are african bees territorial?
14-04-2019T19:28:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"Or maybe the same size. But if they‚Äôre calmer, they‚Äôd likely make no effect on the African bees"
14-04-2019T19:28:02,Bgrmystr2,I don't recall what made them different from normal bees
14-04-2019T19:28:03,CrRAR,They have travelled quite far.
14-04-2019T19:28:13,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúAre they territorial‚Äù
14-04-2019T19:28:15,SpazztasticKiwi,YES
14-04-2019T19:28:21,Bgrmystr2,I don't know XD
14-04-2019T19:28:21,CrRAR,Bees are all territorrial to some extent.
14-04-2019T19:28:38,SpazztasticKiwi,and they can kill. It‚Äôs why they‚Äôre coined ‚Äúkiller bees‚Äù
14-04-2019T19:28:42,CrRAR,They... REALLY like their box.
14-04-2019T19:28:44,Bgrmystr2,"yeah but honeybees are what, fairly standard fare leave you alone?"
14-04-2019T19:28:56,Bgrmystr2,"aren't those not bees, but more in the wasp family?"
14-04-2019T19:29:15,CrRAR,Yeah usually big bugs need a warm steamy climate.
14-04-2019T19:29:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm not sure but I‚Äôm also not too sure I care
14-04-2019T19:29:37,SpazztasticKiwi,We had a nest outside our front door when my dad was still alive
14-04-2019T19:30:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Those things can hold up to being set on fire if you don‚Äôt use enough
14-04-2019T19:30:21,CrRAR,Did he show those bees what-for?
14-04-2019T19:30:53,CrRAR,bee armor - quite resiliant
14-04-2019T19:30:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Well they‚Äôre most definitely gone
14-04-2019T19:31:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Took a few days to completely spray down and take out the whole nest
14-04-2019T19:31:36,CrRAR,Sounds like a victory to me!
14-04-2019T19:32:28,SpazztasticKiwi,We only noticed them when we discovered the door hummed
14-04-2019T19:32:36,SpazztasticKiwi,"And if you know doors, they don‚Äôt hum"
14-04-2019T19:32:39,CrRAR,oh... oh dear.
14-04-2019T19:33:05,CrRAR,Were they in the roof eave or something?
14-04-2019T19:33:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Took a peek out the lil window and there they were
14-04-2019T19:33:28,CrRAR,Yeah they get quite busy... on occation.
14-04-2019T19:33:29,SpazztasticKiwi,"Well we don‚Äôt use what‚Äôs considered the ‚Äúfront door‚Äù, which was where they were"
14-04-2019T19:33:40,CrRAR,I could see that.
14-04-2019T19:34:13,SpazztasticKiwi,It was a door with a screen door. They‚Äôd nested in between since the door wasn‚Äôt used or bothered really at all and the screen had long been gone
14-04-2019T19:34:19,CrRAR,"People forget wreaths on their ""front"" doors till late spring sometimes xD"
14-04-2019T19:34:38,CrRAR,wow
14-04-2019T19:35:00,SpazztasticKiwi,And what did my dad do when we found them?
14-04-2019T19:35:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Bang the door and piss em off
14-04-2019T19:35:16,CrRAR,oh damn
14-04-2019T19:35:18,SpazztasticKiwi,My mom near had a fit
14-04-2019T19:35:36,CrRAR,"I was going to suggest ""attempt to negotiate"""
14-04-2019T19:35:45,CrRAR,At least he didn't OPEN the door.
14-04-2019T19:36:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Nah. I was standing there looking
14-04-2019T19:36:12,SpazztasticKiwi,And that door doesn‚Äôt open easy
14-04-2019T19:36:58,SpazztasticKiwi,And doing that would‚Äôve opened the nest open sure. But it would be opened in the middle of the living room
14-04-2019T19:37:23,CrRAR,That's what I would be most terrified of happening.
14-04-2019T19:37:39,CrRAR,Luckily you guys REALLY never used that door.
14-04-2019T19:37:44,SpazztasticKiwi,He was actually the one that went outside over the few days and doused em with insect killer
14-04-2019T19:38:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Killed the nest slowly - killing chunks every day or so until they had no one to protect and then tore it down
14-04-2019T19:39:04,CrRAR,Yeah a nest can have thousands
14-04-2019T19:39:09,SpazztasticKiwi,I just remember the one that got in the house
14-04-2019T19:39:24,CrRAR,Did you name it?

14-04-2019T21:53:04,Dadrobit,Probably one of my favorite stories came from when he taught auto shop. He had a stereo hooked up to a computer and he let the kids pick the song so long as there are no uncensored swears.
