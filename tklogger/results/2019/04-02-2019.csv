04-02-2019T00:40:41,Dadrobit,"5th grade, I think that's when I first got into Ender's Game? Maybe 4th?"
04-02-2019T00:44:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t remember half of what happened yesterday
04-02-2019T00:44:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Forget 5th grade
04-02-2019T00:44:49,SpazztasticKiwi,School wasn’t that fun anyway
04-02-2019T00:45:13,RimaDraws,i liked school. except the no friends part
04-02-2019T00:45:51,SpazztasticKiwi,I liked the time before my top friend moved
04-02-2019T00:46:16,SpazztasticKiwi,He was hyper protective of friends. It was a calmer time
04-02-2019T00:48:17,RimaDraws,well it is time i hit the bed. i got work tomorrow. so nighty night all and have a good rest of the night. <3 <3
04-02-2019T00:48:25,Dadrobit,I loved (and still do!) to read when I was a kid. Around 5th is when I got in some really fantastic series like the Crystal Singer trilogy and The Rowan series.
04-02-2019T00:49:24,Dadrobit,"No joke, I read too much as a kid. Had to go to a counselor for it. Still have the bookmark somewhere they gave me to ""ration out"" my reading."

04-02-2019T00:49:51,SpazztasticKiwi,I had a circle
04-02-2019T00:50:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I read. In middle school I could knocked out a three-book combo novel in a few days

04-02-2019T15:20:19,Dadrobit,Drawing the blood took all of one minute.
04-02-2019T15:21:06,Dadrobit,And the programming on their TV in the waiting room sucked. It was all super depressing shit like folks dying to cancer and Alzheimers.

04-02-2019T16:01:29,Dadrobit,They don't make em like they used to
04-02-2019T16:34:59,Mippy,I don’t even like McDonqlds fries 🍟
04-02-2019T16:35:18,SpazztasticKiwi,How dare
04-02-2019T16:35:45,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock:
04-02-2019T16:35:51,Bgrmystr2,that's the only good thing they SELL
04-02-2019T16:35:54,Bgrmystr2,how could you
04-02-2019T16:36:00,Mippy,I thibk they are too salty but without the salt I may as well eat a box. They have no flavour
04-02-2019T16:36:37,Bgrmystr2,yeah that's about what I expect if the location you bought fries at had the same quality fries as the rest of the food they sell.
04-02-2019T16:36:44,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s potatoes in a nutshell really
04-02-2019T16:36:54,Bgrmystr2,but there are locations where fries are actually good.
04-02-2019T16:37:04,Mippy,A good potato has a nice flavour
04-02-2019T16:37:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I like light salt. Both for the sake otherwise I get nauseous and I watch my salt eating
04-02-2019T16:37:44,Mippy,Unfortunately I have never met one Bgr
04-02-2019T16:37:52,Bgrmystr2,Mcdonald's fries are the only ones I've ever tasted salt on anyway
04-02-2019T16:38:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Tell you one thing tho if I can hear you chewing your fries I have fantasized about your death
04-02-2019T16:38:24,Bgrmystr2,"I've been around, Mippy, so there's that"
04-02-2019T16:38:42,Mippy,XD
04-02-2019T16:38:54,Bgrmystr2,"Mcdonalds from Georgia, Florida, Louisiana, Massechusetts, New Hampshire"
04-02-2019T16:39:16,Bgrmystr2,"some better than others, of course"
04-02-2019T16:39:39,Bgrmystr2,"but yeah I don't actually recall where the mcdonalds is that I recall, but they were good fries."
04-02-2019T16:39:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Few things bug me more than if I can hear *smack smack smack* 🍟
04-02-2019T16:39:59,SpazztasticKiwi,And of course that’s not limited to fries
04-02-2019T16:40:23,Bgrmystr2,lol kiwi I thought you were saying that about the crunchiness
04-02-2019T16:41:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Nah. Just people who can’t chew with their mouth closed
04-02-2019T16:41:15,ThingsAreMoving,absolutely barbaric
04-02-2019T16:41:18,Mippy,"Oh, by the way, I got that thing you told me to get. Says I’m good and running at an average of 33-34 degrees. Don’t know what any of the numbers mean. So I still don’t know why chat borks our during stream."
04-02-2019T16:41:19,ThingsAreMoving,also hi o/
04-02-2019T16:41:36,Mippy,Hi Things
04-02-2019T16:42:03,Bgrmystr2,chat borking during stream is probably a network connection thing.
04-02-2019T16:42:12,Mippy,I don’t even understand how people chew open mouth
04-02-2019T16:42:54,SpazztasticKiwi,I work with someone that does
04-02-2019T16:42:59,Mippy,Hmmm...probably. The great white north is not known for its spectacular connections
04-02-2019T16:43:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I sit there screaming internally every time
04-02-2019T16:43:36,SpazztasticKiwi,You can even hear with headphones in
04-02-2019T16:43:50,Bgrmystr2,"mostly what you're gonna be watching is read error rate, reallocated sectors (stuff that's been moved cuz the space it was on broke), seek error, reallocation event, uncorrectable sector, and write error rate."
04-02-2019T16:43:50,Mippy,He is
04-02-2019T16:44:33,Mippy,Dammit autocorrect
04-02-2019T16:44:34,ThingsAreMoving,Ask him politely if he can stop smacking while eating
04-02-2019T16:44:39,SpazztasticKiwi,She
04-02-2019T16:44:56,ThingsAreMoving,if he refuses download an ASMr from youtube and play it on full volume while he does it
04-02-2019T16:45:00,ThingsAreMoving,she*
04-02-2019T16:45:05,Bgrmystr2,read and write errors are bad because that means the arm is likely having problems moving or the disk itself is damaged.
04-02-2019T16:45:19,Bgrmystr2,"but yeah, as long as it says you're fine, then you should be fine. :)"
04-02-2019T16:45:38,Mippy,Got a screen shot. I’ll take a look hen I get home. Cool.
04-02-2019T16:46:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera is pulling every cute trick out of his little bag trying to get me to give him a nugget
04-02-2019T16:46:30,Bgrmystr2,"also, if it ever says caution next to health status, you can hover over the caution with your mouse and it'll tell you what's wrong. Or rather, it should. Mine does."
04-02-2019T16:46:47,Mippy,That’s handy
04-02-2019T16:46:56,Bgrmystr2,:thumbsup:
04-02-2019T16:47:28,Mippy,Especially since I’m not knowledgeable enough about computers to diagnose it myself.
04-02-2019T16:47:52,ThingsAreMoving,"You can open a support ticket with picarto, too. It's probably your network doin' some shenanigans, maybe losing packets or something."
04-02-2019T16:48:32,Bgrmystr2,"yeh, learning even the simplest stuff is probably a good idea. Even if you don't know how to fix a computer, being able to potentially identify a problem to begin with is a huge win."
04-02-2019T16:50:35,Mippy,Should probably get “Computers for Dummies” from the library then. Dose sound like a good idea to educate myself about it a bit.
04-02-2019T16:51:05,Mippy,The more you know....
04-02-2019T16:51:10,Bgrmystr2,"as long as you use a computer, or laptop, or whatever, it'll be beneficial."
04-02-2019T16:51:21,Bgrmystr2,It's never too late.
04-02-2019T16:51:50,Mippy,Which will probably be the rest of my life...
04-02-2019T16:52:02,Mippy,Unless I go blind
04-02-2019T16:52:20,Bgrmystr2,haha yeah
04-02-2019T16:59:46,Mippy,Silly question but did any of you have a favourite toilet at University or college? Like one you rather go to then any other?
04-02-2019T16:59:56,ThingsAreMoving,"diagnosing pc problems is easy nowadays, you have tons of tools and manuals online. Back in the day you had to listen to a pc speeker and count how many times it beeped on startup to know which part of your PC caused problems"
04-02-2019T17:00:33,Bgrmystr2,"to be fair, you still do that, but that's only ever been one part of it."
04-02-2019T17:00:34,ThingsAreMoving,"I did not. I had a least favorite one, it always smelled of cigarettes."
04-02-2019T17:00:52,Bgrmystr2,And nope
04-02-2019T17:01:41,Mippy,:ctwokinds-keithdotdotdot: ok... I’m strange then. Mine has some entertaining graffiti
04-02-2019T17:01:47,Bgrmystr2,"back then the only thing that was widespread was beepcodes. Nowadays the internet and computers and such is so mainstream that you don't really need beepcodes, the motherboards have screens that literally show you what error number it's having.."
04-02-2019T17:01:57,Bgrmystr2,"it didn't help that I didn't go to one, Mippy haha"
04-02-2019T17:02:42,Mippy,^ That’s true I guess
04-02-2019T17:03:37,Mippy,"That moment when you see some one exit the washroom without washing...,you disgusting human"
04-02-2019T17:04:16,ThingsAreMoving,could be worse... but I'll save you the need to bleach your brain
04-02-2019T17:04:26,ThingsAreMoving,"and not gonna tell, lol"
04-02-2019T17:04:45,Mippy,Quite alright
04-02-2019T17:05:20,ThingsAreMoving,"brb, need something hot to drink"
04-02-2019T17:05:36,Mippy,I can’t afford hot drink :ctwokinds-LauraCry:
04-02-2019T17:05:51,Mippy,And it’s fracking cold
04-02-2019T17:10:18,ThingsAreMoving,:ctwokinds-RaineEep: how the heck you can't afford a hot drink?
04-02-2019T17:13:05,Mippy,I only have money for my bus fair for the week. I’m not at home so I can’t just boil water right now.
04-02-2019T17:14:15,Mippy,Jan was hard. I had to pay off school and buy food and stuff
04-02-2019T17:14:58,ThingsAreMoving,You poor thing.
04-02-2019T17:15:21,Mippy,"Yes, I am poor right now."
04-02-2019T17:17:28,Mippy,"Oh well, still better than starch pie :ctwokinds-rainehappy:"
04-02-2019T17:17:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Pets. Assuring you can’t go to the bathroom for ANYTHING without them following

04-02-2019T17:20:22,Dadrobit,Can confirm. The bathroom in Studio 28 at school was my favorite bathroom.
04-02-2019T17:20:31,ThingsAreMoving,"Godspeed, Mippy"
04-02-2019T17:20:35,Mippy,Hi five Dad
04-02-2019T17:20:43,Dadrobit,o/
04-02-2019T17:22:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I have bathrooms I’ll more likely use. But there’s not much choice most often
04-02-2019T17:22:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Work is the worst because they like to close it for cleaning every 10 minutes
04-02-2019T17:22:55,SpazztasticKiwi,And yet those women with little boys will still manage to have Timmy make a mess and leave it
04-02-2019T17:23:05,SpazztasticKiwi,For all to see
04-02-2019T17:23:28,ThingsAreMoving,Trust me... drunk lorry drivers are worse
04-02-2019T17:24:08,ThingsAreMoving,unless your little Timmy had explosive diarrhea
04-02-2019T17:24:35,SpazztasticKiwi,We’ve had a case or two where the kid missed the toilet yea
04-02-2019T17:24:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Parent didn’t care
04-02-2019T17:25:22,ThingsAreMoving,"Yeah, been there, cleaned that. Changed jobs, no need to do that anymore."
04-02-2019T17:25:39,SpazztasticKiwi,"But at my sisters job, there was a little kid that smeared poo over the bathroom"
04-02-2019T17:25:47,SpazztasticKiwi,The dad was informed

04-02-2019T17:27:39,ThingsAreMoving,Proper upbringing? In 2019?
04-02-2019T17:28:08,SpazztasticKiwi,The dad wasn’t terribly happy. The kid was apparently having a fit
04-02-2019T17:28:22,SpazztasticKiwi,I imagine he got in bigger trouble at home
04-02-2019T17:30:17,unsteddyphoenix,We can only hope so

04-02-2019T17:33:27,ThingsAreMoving,Next friday I'll be going off to visit the company that I hope to be working for soon™.
04-02-2019T17:34:21,ThingsAreMoving,"2nd part of the interview. If everything goes according to plan I'll be earning moar, and learn how to operate more advanced machinery."
04-02-2019T17:34:36,Bgrmystr2,I hope it goes well
04-02-2019T17:35:10,unsteddyphoenix,Wish you many good lucks
04-02-2019T17:35:33,ThingsAreMoving,Thank. I feel pretty positive about it.
04-02-2019T17:38:19,unsteddyphoenix,Sounds like a very good win-win
04-02-2019T17:38:33,unsteddyphoenix,Alpha move: hand in your two weeks before the interview
04-02-2019T17:38:46,unsteddyphoenix,CONFIDENCE
04-02-2019T17:39:15,ThingsAreMoving,"I wanted to do it. I had it printed a week ago, same day I've had my 1st part of the interview"
04-02-2019T17:39:36,ThingsAreMoving,but I figured I'll be a bit more adult about it and play it safe.
04-02-2019T17:40:01,ThingsAreMoving,cuz just moving over will cost me ~£2000
04-02-2019T17:40:37,ThingsAreMoving,and that's a sizable chunk of my savings
04-02-2019T17:40:48,unsteddyphoenix,Mmmmfine
04-02-2019T17:42:41,Dadrobit,So I finished KH3 last night. Gonna get the plat trophy in it and then it's definitely going to be a GS return.
04-02-2019T17:42:57,ThingsAreMoving,still 2/10 ?
04-02-2019T17:43:02,Dadrobit,6/10
04-02-2019T17:43:12,ThingsAreMoving,solid
04-02-2019T17:44:28,Dadrobit,"The last 7ish percent was actually pretty alright. But man, the game had issues in everything from the combat ideology, to the story pacing, to the technical competency of basic functionality."
04-02-2019T17:45:13,Dadrobit,"I went in with slightly hotter than lukewarm expectations, and it barely delivered even on that."
04-02-2019T17:46:51,Dadrobit,"In a time where games like God of War are a thing, so many of the issues in KH3 are just inexcusable."
04-02-2019T17:47:17,ThingsAreMoving,"wait, is KH3 an AAA title?"
04-02-2019T17:47:46,Dadrobit,I was asking myself the same thing the third time the game bugged out a major story boss fight.
04-02-2019T17:47:59,ThingsAreMoving,ouch
04-02-2019T17:49:10,Dadrobit,"I've seen a few independent reviewers that are pointing out some of the same issues, but all of the major publications are giving it 8 or 9/10 scores."
04-02-2019T17:49:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Speaking of jobs
04-02-2019T17:49:49,SpazztasticKiwi,New policy changed the relationship between our bonuses and attendance
04-02-2019T17:50:08,ThingsAreMoving,"Let me guess, bonuses are now harder to get?"
04-02-2019T17:50:18,SpazztasticKiwi,0 points = 125% of the base bonus amount
04-02-2019T17:50:40,SpazztasticKiwi,So if the bonus is $200 that quarter....
04-02-2019T17:51:36,ThingsAreMoving,Is that a yearly bonus?
04-02-2019T17:51:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Quarterly
04-02-2019T17:51:56,ThingsAreMoving,"Damn, that's nice."
04-02-2019T17:52:15,SpazztasticKiwi,4 pts you get nothin but your check
04-02-2019T17:52:28,ThingsAreMoving,I got £150 as a christmas bonus in a form of a store gift card
04-02-2019T17:52:42,ThingsAreMoving,once a year
04-02-2019T17:53:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"Yeah other than these quarter bonuses and a 25%ish discount for thanksgiving/Christmas season, we don’t get much else"
04-02-2019T17:53:53,ThingsAreMoving,Yep. Still I wouldn't trade my current job for a job in retail
04-02-2019T17:53:59,SpazztasticKiwi,"Off on Christmas Day, close down early Christmas Eve, and work thanksgiving"
04-02-2019T17:54:28,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s some fun people
04-02-2019T17:54:46,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m surprised at how my patience can sometimes stretch
04-02-2019T17:55:11,SpazztasticKiwi,“I want a half pound of Cajun roast beef and pepper jack cheese”
04-02-2019T17:55:24,SpazztasticKiwi,“We no longer have the Cajun roast beef”
04-02-2019T17:55:26,ThingsAreMoving,Have you developed a deep hate for the humankind yet?
04-02-2019T17:55:39,SpazztasticKiwi,“I didn’t say Cajun roast beef I said Cajun turkey”
04-02-2019T17:55:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Madam. I am not deaf or stupid
04-02-2019T17:56:01,Dadrobit,Albertson's used to give a $20 gift card to the store to the cashier who sold the most donations. But those stopped a few months into my employment.
04-02-2019T17:56:05,SpazztasticKiwi,But wait. There’s more
04-02-2019T17:56:40,Dadrobit,Security gave a $50 Amazon gift card and dinner with the district manager at a steak house to the officer of the month.
04-02-2019T17:57:03,SpazztasticKiwi,She returns to the now cut turkey and pepper jack cheese and complains “I wanted colby jack cheese not pepper jack”
04-02-2019T17:57:20,ThingsAreMoving,I'd take it but only if the district manager sat on the other end of the steakhouse
04-02-2019T17:57:21,Dadrobit,Never won that though. Graveyard shift meant that I was never considered.
04-02-2019T17:57:33,SpazztasticKiwi,The lord was testing me
04-02-2019T17:57:56,SpazztasticKiwi,"Problem is, this lady is well known to do this"
04-02-2019T17:58:31,Dadrobit,"Well, as I understand it, it would have been a dozen or so officers all together with the district manager."
04-02-2019T17:58:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Steak dinner. Can I have fish?
04-02-2019T17:59:08,Dadrobit,"But again, working the night shift, I never got the commendation."
04-02-2019T17:59:16,ThingsAreMoving,I don't like distractions when I have a delicious steak before me
04-02-2019T17:59:29,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m only half kidding of course. I’ll eat both but I’m more of a fish person
04-02-2019T18:00:10,Dadrobit,"Oh man, made the best filet mignon the other night. Was damn near arousing tbh."
04-02-2019T18:00:18,ThingsAreMoving,"I like fish, but I absolutely hate cooking fish"
04-02-2019T18:00:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Which that reminds me. A lady came up to the hot case yesterday and asked what kind of fish was the catfish
04-02-2019T18:00:41,ThingsAreMoving,"Catfish, as the name implies is a meowing fish"
04-02-2019T18:00:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Didn’t even glance at the “catfish - $5.98/lb” sign
04-02-2019T18:01:47,SpazztasticKiwi,I told her it’s catfish and she physically shuddered “why’s catfish the only thing y’all eat in Alabama?”
04-02-2019T18:02:09,SpazztasticKiwi,I dont control the menu ok
04-02-2019T18:03:07,ThingsAreMoving,"Should've told her you're having a nice tuna steak for lunch, later on. Not for sale btw"
04-02-2019T18:04:07,Dadrobit,Be back in a bit.
04-02-2019T18:04:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t get near the stories that the cashiers do but I have a special kind
04-02-2019T18:51:28,RimaDraws,home
04-02-2019T18:59:41,ZahnHolley,Howdy cowboi

04-02-2019T19:29:30,SpazztasticKiwi,You know I realize now that I’m off Friday
04-02-2019T19:29:45,SpazztasticKiwi,So Friday stream I might actually stick

04-02-2019T19:37:15,Bgrmystr2,askin for a bit much xD
04-02-2019T19:38:02,ThingsAreMoving,"Zahn pls, I've  been welcoming you this way for more than a year"
04-02-2019T19:38:49,ThingsAreMoving,Here's a snep holding a gold piece if that makes you feel better. :ctwokinds-adiracoin:
04-02-2019T19:50:28,ZahnHolley,"Far enough bruh,"
04-02-2019T19:51:14,ZahnHolley,Fair enougn*
04-02-2019T19:51:38,ZahnHolley,Dangit i did it again >.>
04-02-2019T19:52:15,Dadrobit,Testing one two?
04-02-2019T19:52:24,Dadrobit,\o/ Internet works@
04-02-2019T19:52:36,Dadrobit,Typing sucks
04-02-2019T19:52:58,Dadrobit,Back from the Cox store to complain about my internet.
04-02-2019T19:53:11,ThingsAreMoving,wb dad
04-02-2019T19:53:39,Dadrobit,They gave me a new modem and upgraded me from 50 down 10 up to 300 down 30 up for free for a year.
04-02-2019T19:54:02,Dadrobit,"+$20 after a year, so it's not terrible actually."
04-02-2019T19:55:01,ThingsAreMoving,Good stuff
04-02-2019T19:55:25,ThingsAreMoving,How much for that 300/30 after one year?
04-02-2019T19:55:59,Dadrobit,$110 + tax.
04-02-2019T19:56:25,Dadrobit,I was paying $90 for 50/10.
04-02-2019T19:56:51,ThingsAreMoving,oof
04-02-2019T19:57:06,Dadrobit,"Evidentially that option is no longer even offered to folks in my area and my contract was just ""grandfathered in""."
04-02-2019T19:57:46,Dadrobit,Everything is at least 100/10 now.
04-02-2019T19:58:22,ThingsAreMoving,y'all need more ISP in the US. More competition to cut the prices down.
04-02-2019T19:58:45,ThingsAreMoving,"er... wait, we've had this conversation before. as you were."
04-02-2019T19:59:12,Dadrobit,"Didn't you hear about what just happened a few months back? That even if only one ISP is available in an area, it cannot be legally defined as a Monopoly?"
04-02-2019T19:59:32,Dadrobit,So they can fuck folks as hard as they want.
04-02-2019T20:00:21,ThingsAreMoving,":ctwokinds-keithdotdotdot: land of the free, huh"
04-02-2019T20:00:23,Dadrobit,"Unfortunately. As much as I'd love to get angry in this conversation, I have to go watch my nephew's school band. So I am off again."
04-02-2019T20:00:28,Dadrobit,o/
04-02-2019T20:00:32,ThingsAreMoving,o/
04-02-2019T20:01:08,RimaDraws,hm
04-02-2019T20:05:39,CrRAR,"bye robit, enjoy~"
04-02-2019T20:28:09,Bgrmystr2,The USA.. where definitions of words are not sourced from the dictionary.. which systematically defines words.
04-02-2019T20:28:31,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-confused: We have a lot of issues.
04-02-2019T20:34:16,RimaDraws,yup
04-02-2019T20:39:29,ZahnHolley,"Fluff Butt,"

04-02-2019T21:14:31,RimaDraws,just be careful with it. mine fell from my hand and onto concrete and it broke. this was last week then i had to replace it.
04-02-2019T21:15:19,RimaDraws,but i didnt have my screen protector on it i took off months ago nor a proper case

04-02-2019T21:43:47,SpazztasticKiwi,🍝
04-02-2019T21:44:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Why does it feel so late
04-02-2019T21:44:27,Dadrobit,Back from the kiddo's concert. It was moderate to high levels of adorable.
04-02-2019T21:44:54,SpazztasticKiwi,moigh?
04-02-2019T21:45:25,SpazztasticKiwi,On a scale 1-11
04-02-2019T21:45:26,Dadrobit,Yes. Prezactly
04-02-2019T21:47:21,Dadrobit,1st grade choir concert.
04-02-2019T21:47:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"There was no mob, but a light standing ovation"
04-02-2019T21:47:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Aw
04-02-2019T21:47:58,SpazztasticKiwi,I have few little cousins. Most are around my age
04-02-2019T21:48:20,SpazztasticKiwi,So little kid stuff isn’t something I get to go to
04-02-2019T21:49:03,Dadrobit,"I have tons of nieces and nephews. All ranging from learning to walk, to attending high school."
04-02-2019T21:49:57,SpazztasticKiwi,I got 1 sister. Nieces and nephews don’t appear to be a possibility in existence
04-02-2019T21:50:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Unless I marry. And that marriage gains me an in-law
04-02-2019T21:50:55,Dadrobit,A half brother and two half sisters. Two step brothers and one step sister.
04-02-2019T21:51:38,Dadrobit,Christmas is expensive.
04-02-2019T21:52:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Well considering there’s add ons of the nieces and nephews I’d say so
04-02-2019T21:52:37,SpazztasticKiwi,A good gag gift on year could be a pack of batteries “toy not included”
04-02-2019T21:52:43,SpazztasticKiwi,one
04-02-2019T21:52:52,Dadrobit,Only my little brother doesn't have any kids. But he wants some in the near future.
04-02-2019T21:53:11,Dadrobit,"Nah, I'm the cool uncle."
04-02-2019T21:53:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Uncle Dad Half Step Brother
04-02-2019T21:54:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Now that’s a title
04-02-2019T21:54:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Add Husband one day. You’ll have collected them all
04-02-2019T21:55:52,Dadrobit,"Even then I'd just be called ""Daddy"""
04-02-2019T21:56:45,SpazztasticKiwi,That reminds me of a funny story
04-02-2019T21:57:07,SpazztasticKiwi,"A woman was often told she had a high, young sounding voice on the phone"
04-02-2019T21:57:57,SpazztasticKiwi,One day a scam caller rang and she answered and immediately they went to a “talking to a kid voice” and asked “hey there little one. Is mommy around?”
04-02-2019T21:58:17,SpazztasticKiwi,She decides to play a trick “no mommy is in the shower”
04-02-2019T21:58:25,SpazztasticKiwi,“Ok how about daddy?”
04-02-2019T21:58:54,SpazztasticKiwi,“Daddy’s in the shower too. They’re making a lot of weird noises. Do you want me to go get them?”
04-02-2019T21:59:09,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-ohmy::ptv-laugh:
04-02-2019T21:59:25,Dadrobit,"""Can I face time them?"""
04-02-2019T21:59:31,Bgrmystr2,haha
04-02-2019T21:59:44,SpazztasticKiwi,“NO! NO whatever you do don’t go in there. I’ll call back”
04-02-2019T22:00:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Probably gave that telemarketer a heart attack
04-02-2019T22:00:25,Bgrmystr2,scammers.. not willing to sacrifice a little girl to get money from her parents.
04-02-2019T22:01:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Warms the heart
04-02-2019T22:02:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Little children astound me
04-02-2019T22:02:48,SpazztasticKiwi,I had one run up to me near tears cause he couldn’t find his mommy at the book fair
04-02-2019T22:03:13,SpazztasticKiwi,We were in the parking lot
04-02-2019T22:03:49,SpazztasticKiwi,My first thought was she’d somehow drove off without him
04-02-2019T22:04:25,SpazztasticKiwi,But no. She was inside - unaware her kid had wondered out the door into a parking lot where cars were leaving
04-02-2019T22:15:19,PackHunter10,Hi
04-02-2019T23:36:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Who sells a secluded 4 bedroom 2 bath house with a basement for $139000?  Who died in it?
04-02-2019T23:40:06,Bgrmystr2,seems fairly expensive for a house that someone died in..
04-02-2019T23:40:19,Bgrmystr2,least imo lol
04-02-2019T23:40:52,SpazztasticKiwi,That second question was rhetorical
04-02-2019T23:41:02,Bgrmystr2,"well, so was my statement"
04-02-2019T23:41:04,Bgrmystr2,xD
04-02-2019T23:41:09,SpazztasticKiwi,The thing also has two kitchens and a storm shelter
04-02-2019T23:41:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Who needs two kitchens
