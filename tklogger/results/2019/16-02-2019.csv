16-02-2019T10:57:48,ThingsAreMoving,So... could be better but not too many reasons to complain too?
16-02-2019T10:58:00,RimaDraws,i guess so
16-02-2019T10:59:00,ThingsAreMoving,Busy doing commisions?
16-02-2019T10:59:15,RimaDraws,watching neo yokio before i go to service
16-02-2019T11:00:10,ThingsAreMoving,Not sure if I get it right. If it's what I think it is then my condolences.
16-02-2019T11:00:21,RimaDraws,no its church service
16-02-2019T11:01:25,ThingsAreMoving,Is it fun? I'm not sure how to react to it.
16-02-2019T11:02:05,ThingsAreMoving,"I know some people enjoy it, or get some sense of fulfillment. Others feel like it's a waste of time and just do it cause of social pressure."
16-02-2019T11:02:31,RimaDraws,no i go for my nana. she dont like going alone and i dont like going alone so we go together.
16-02-2019T11:03:09,ThingsAreMoving,sounds wholesome
16-02-2019T11:03:42,ThingsAreMoving,enjoy your service then
16-02-2019T11:03:59,RimaDraws,its not till another hour. so i have to get around soon.
16-02-2019T11:04:56,ThingsAreMoving,"Is your church one of those ""sing your hearts out, praise hard and listen to the fiery sermon of the preacher"" kind of thing?"
16-02-2019T11:05:07,RimaDraws,no methodists arent like the baptists
16-02-2019T11:05:23,RimaDraws,we are much more mellow than them.
16-02-2019T11:05:50,RimaDraws,i used to be in a baptist church but i found methodist is more my thing. i still count myself as non denominational.
16-02-2019T11:06:30,RimaDraws,we're in an old fashioned small church building. we dont go all out for church. we just praise as we should
16-02-2019T11:06:39,ThingsAreMoving,"Most of the masses I've encountered were like ""sorry I'm alive, Lord, sorry I'm sinful, sorry for all the trouble but I'm trying to love you so pls don't sendf me to hell"" kind of thing"
16-02-2019T11:07:12,ThingsAreMoving,But that's catholic europe for ya.
16-02-2019T11:07:13,RimaDraws,well we do the prayers that methodists do but we refrain from the 'send me to hell' bit
16-02-2019T11:10:17,ThingsAreMoving,I feel the most comfortable with the idea that some higher force created the universe and then just peaced out.
16-02-2019T11:10:25,ThingsAreMoving,I guess that makes me a Deist.
16-02-2019T11:11:27,RimaDraws,That’s fine with me

16-02-2019T11:13:36,RimaDraws,^^
16-02-2019T11:22:40,RimaDraws,But still. How are you doing things? I haven’t been here majority of the week
16-02-2019T11:27:20,ThingsAreMoving,I had a job interview last friday. Production manager that was doing it seemed to be impressed with my knowledge and we agreed on many ideas how a company should be run. They'll let me know within the next one and a half week if I'll get the job.
16-02-2019T11:28:20,ThingsAreMoving,"If that happens I'll have to hand my notice and continue to provide services to my current employer for two weeks, during that time I'll have to find some accomodation and all that jazz."
16-02-2019T11:29:43,RimaDraws,Yea I bet. Sounds like a good opportunity
16-02-2019T11:34:51,RimaDraws,I had a pretty okay week. Lost 2.8 more pounds on my diet and I ranked up at work on the seniority list. Means I’m getting closer to full time

16-02-2019T11:50:29,ThingsAreMoving,also congrats on your potential full time work
16-02-2019T11:51:09,ThingsAreMoving,I know it makes a massive difference when you know how much you'll make per week
16-02-2019T11:51:17,ThingsAreMoving,instead of guessing
16-02-2019T11:52:00,RimaDraws,Thank you but it will be at least a year and a half before I get it. I appreciate it tho

16-02-2019T16:00:43,Ordithus,windows or apple
16-02-2019T16:00:45,Bgrmystr2,I'm under the impression that it's some kind of touch pad type deal.
16-02-2019T16:00:51,Bgrmystr2,and not actually a mousepad.

16-02-2019T16:30:40,Mihari,"One could argue that by not saying vixen Nat but vixen Keith they were implying male Nat, but still male Nat always looks 'female'"

16-02-2019T16:30:55,Ordithus,Except when Nat is extra male
16-02-2019T16:31:01,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah its an acceptable technicality

16-02-2019T16:31:53,Storyteller3010,Hi all. Im back.
16-02-2019T16:31:53,Mihari,Personally I hope tom considers pulling these damn requests because people are getting so bitchy about what they darn request says!
16-02-2019T16:31:54,CrRAR,Lady-fox Nat is still fresh in everyone’s memory banks.
16-02-2019T16:32:01,McClaw,"If a male (body) fox Natani was desired, ""todd Natani"" would have been appropriate."

16-02-2019T16:32:09,Xexanoth,so it would make sense nat would be in femaly body here too
16-02-2019T16:32:26,BadFoMo,@Mihari Which ones?

16-02-2019T16:32:34,CrRAR,;_;
16-02-2019T16:32:45,Bgrmystr2,I think it's fine to read the suggestion as-is instead of jumping to conclusions about what it could mean. :)
16-02-2019T16:32:50,BluePhantom90,I was just saying as a Joke Sketch idea. Since people love Keith and Nat sketches
16-02-2019T16:32:51,Xexanoth,but if we can't complain about stuff then what would we even talk about :ptv-laugh: @Mihari
16-02-2019T16:32:52,Ordithus,"Either way, both Keith and Nat are lookin fine :ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:"

16-02-2019T16:33:28,Mippy,Yes...interpretation...

16-02-2019T18:08:04,MuonNeutrino,"she's a person who is the child of a normal human and a wolf who had the magical ability to transform into a human. she considers herself human, but inherited her father's transformation ability"
16-02-2019T18:08:06,MrMongMong,It wasn't flawless enough.
16-02-2019T18:08:08,ThingsAreMoving,"huh, I believe ya. Not a werewolf expert"
16-02-2019T18:08:11,unsteddyphoenix,She is a full human.
16-02-2019T18:08:15,CrimsonQuill,"So she can't really control her for,m."
16-02-2019T18:08:25,MrMongMong,I wonder why her default form is the wolf?
16-02-2019T18:08:30,Bgrmystr2,"it's not, Mong,."
16-02-2019T18:08:34,ThingsAreMoving,^
16-02-2019T18:08:34,Ordithus,Because the TK fans are merciless
16-02-2019T18:08:37,Bgrmystr2,she just can't control it
16-02-2019T18:08:39,Ordithus,And fluffy biased
16-02-2019T18:08:40,CrimsonQuill,glares at Mary Silverlock for not giving her daughter an education
16-02-2019T18:08:42,MuonNeutrino,"@MrMongMong it's not, just she's been repressing it so long it bursts out"
16-02-2019T18:08:43,MrMongMong,Oh.
16-02-2019T18:08:44,vevans0009,She is confusing me.
16-02-2019T18:08:45,ThingsAreMoving,we prefer her floofy
16-02-2019T18:08:46,vevans0009,XD

16-02-2019T18:10:57,ThingsAreMoving,Jim simmer your tatas. Tom is doing his pick first
16-02-2019T18:11:08,unsteddyphoenix,straight up rigging the vote isnt allowed
16-02-2019T18:11:11,CrimsonQuill,"Aww, they have ice cream!"
16-02-2019T18:11:15,unsteddyphoenix,In case that wasnt obvious lol

16-02-2019T18:11:19,Bgrmystr2,"lol you could probably just not mention them here that'd be great, Jim"
16-02-2019T18:11:21,CrimsonQuill,That's sweet.
16-02-2019T18:11:22,MrMongMong,I'm thinking that it would be more Hanbok than Kimono.
16-02-2019T18:11:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Is raine wearing a kimono?
16-02-2019T18:11:27,CrimsonQuill,Maybe
16-02-2019T18:11:27,Mandag,It's not rigging though. People are free to vote whatever they want.
16-02-2019T18:11:30,ThingsAreMoving,"also, what Bgr said"
16-02-2019T18:11:36,CrRAR,very fancy
16-02-2019T18:11:38,Bgrmystr2,"that's the definition of rigging, Mandag."
16-02-2019T18:11:45,vevans0009,Hanbok is Korean?
16-02-2019T18:11:48,MrMongMong,Yeah.
16-02-2019T18:11:48,Zakuru,pfft
16-02-2019T18:11:55,JimMcDuff,"Really?  His pick first?  That's fine then I guess.  Oh, I also posted to the discords too about the Laurem."
16-02-2019T18:11:56,Bgrmystr2,so your argument is invalid.
16-02-2019T18:12:00,vevans0009,Yes!  I R smart.
16-02-2019T18:12:00,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Welp the Raine fan boy in me is screaming in joy :ctwokinds-sleepoverB:

16-02-2019T18:12:17,JimMcDuff,"No, I went too far advertising it."

16-02-2019T18:12:53,Bgrmystr2,not anymore
16-02-2019T18:12:56,MuonNeutrino,i would say that getting people who aren't watching the stream or otherwise participating in the process to come and vote is kinda rigging it.
16-02-2019T18:13:05,Bgrmystr2,"""Kinda"" lol"

16-02-2019T18:13:17,CrimsonQuill,"Actually, Tom, can I get those sweets outside of Korea, or are they a Korea only thing?"
16-02-2019T18:13:19,MuonNeutrino,@Bgrmystr2 i was being generous =P
16-02-2019T18:13:24,Bgrmystr2,I wasn't.
16-02-2019T18:13:26,Mandag,"You're not really an anon here, Jim."

16-02-2019T18:20:31,Mandag,But that was 7 years ago.
16-02-2019T18:20:34,vevans0009,I think its cruel that Keidran age fast. ( not blaming Tom)
16-02-2019T18:20:41,Ordithus,I forgot that 8 is the age of adulthood for the fluffy ones
16-02-2019T18:20:44,Mippy,She is very elderly then
16-02-2019T18:20:47,Mandag,"Since Saria is alive in it, and she hadn't even properly met Trace yet."
16-02-2019T18:20:50,MrMongMong,She ages well.
16-02-2019T18:20:52,unsteddyphoenix,But its literally Toms fault they age fast!
16-02-2019T18:20:58,vevans0009,Sexiest grandma I ever seen.
16-02-2019T18:21:05,Aimbotexe,Nows your chance mandag
16-02-2019T18:21:05,Ordithus,Except she isn't even a momma
16-02-2019T18:21:08,MuonNeutrino,TDM is probably 6ish years before the current comic timeline
16-02-2019T18:21:10,CrimsonQuill,I love the organs in this piece.
16-02-2019T18:21:11,vevans0009,Shhhhh.....
16-02-2019T18:21:16,Mandag,Now's my chance to what?
16-02-2019T18:21:24,CrimsonQuill,Let's not get bogged down with chronology.
16-02-2019T18:21:28,MuonNeutrino,"making nat 7ish during it, or mid-teens equivalent"
16-02-2019T18:21:39,CrimsonQuill,"Let's just look at the sketch, enjoy it, and enjoy the music."
16-02-2019T18:21:40,Aimbotexe,To find out how old nat is (possibly)
16-02-2019T18:21:44,MuonNeutrino,"and zen 8, 18-ish equivalent"
16-02-2019T18:21:46,MrMongMong,This is starting to sound like a Film Theory.
16-02-2019T18:21:47,Mandag,"Nah, she can't have been loder than 6, the math doesn't lie."
16-02-2019T18:21:51,Aimbotexe,Was*
16-02-2019T18:22:03,RedSamus4,Film theory?
16-02-2019T18:22:11,CrimsonQuill,MattPad?
16-02-2019T18:22:15,MrMongMong,Yes.
16-02-2019T18:22:16,MuonNeutrino,"@Mandag problem is if you look at the maeve aging chart tom posted, 6 is WAY too young for nat's appearance during TDM"
16-02-2019T18:22:18,Bgrmystr2,"perhaps it is a theory, Mong, but it's a comic theory"
16-02-2019T18:22:24,Mippy,Nssjsjsnsknsns
16-02-2019T18:22:24,ThingsAreMoving,"brb, need moar tea"
16-02-2019T18:22:28,Combak,Third channel!
16-02-2019T18:22:28,vevans0009,"Truthfully, no creature in the animal kingdom looks ugly when they are old."
16-02-2019T18:22:31,CrimsonQuill,OK Things
16-02-2019T18:22:32,Mandag,I know. Ain't my fault it doesn't make sense.
16-02-2019T18:22:34,CrRAR,go git dat tea
16-02-2019T18:22:38,ThingsAreMoving,"keep the chaos to a maximum while I'm gone, will ya?"
16-02-2019T18:22:39,CrimsonQuill,Earl grey
16-02-2019T18:22:40,vevans0009,I envy them.
16-02-2019T18:22:41,CrimsonQuill,Forever
16-02-2019T18:22:46,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-katdryer:
16-02-2019T18:22:50,Ordithus,"vevans, that's because wild animals die young"
16-02-2019T18:22:56,Mandag,We know TDM was 7 years ago because it took Trace 6 years from Saria's death until the start of the comic.
16-02-2019T18:23:04,CrimsonQuill,"I shall call forth the demons of chaos and turn this chat into a maelstrom for you, Things."
16-02-2019T18:23:10,Aimbotexe,"TOM you must settle this, how old was Nat in TDM"
16-02-2019T18:23:10,CrRAR,poor aminals
16-02-2019T18:23:12,MuonNeutrino,"@Mandag you can make it work, the key is realizing that nora stated the timeline wrong in her explanation to trace, she said it had been 6 years since saria's death but if you look at the dates on the tombstone and in trace's journal it was only 5"
16-02-2019T18:23:14,Storyteller3010,Just curiously asking. How many rounds do they pretend to be in these Sunday sketches?
16-02-2019T18:23:15,unsteddyphoenix,things will be civil
16-02-2019T18:23:16,Darkewulf,"Unrelated note, Karen did EXACTLY what I wanted to do in the current page"
16-02-2019T18:23:22,Darkewulf,poor Saddie Maddie
16-02-2019T18:23:23,vevans0009,Some age to old age.
16-02-2019T18:23:32,MuonNeutrino,@Darkewulf i think literally everyone would agree with you there
16-02-2019T18:23:33,Mandag,Then add another year because it took a full year for Saria and Trace to get married after they first met.
16-02-2019T18:23:33,vevans0009,I've seen them.
16-02-2019T18:23:34,Combak,Agreed Darke!
16-02-2019T18:23:52,MuonNeutrino,"@Mandag we don't know how long it took, it was presented as rather a whirlwind courtship tho"
16-02-2019T18:23:55,Darkewulf,I just wanted to give her a big hug
16-02-2019T18:24:02,CrimsonQuill,heads off to the loo
16-02-2019T18:24:08,vevans0009,"LIke when Laura said I am getting old"".  I call bullshit.  Girl, you look smokin'!"
16-02-2019T18:24:16,CrRAR,:ok_hand:
16-02-2019T18:24:20,Mippy,Loo loo skip to my loo
16-02-2019T18:24:22,Mandag,She explicitly states how he started courting her in summer and how they married the next spring or something.
16-02-2019T18:24:30,Darkewulf,"Yeah, they only courted for a few months"
16-02-2019T18:24:34,MrMongMong,"I think she meant ""I'm literally going to die soon"""
16-02-2019T18:24:38,LannAF,I love these outfits
16-02-2019T18:24:42,Mandag,"Don't remember teh exact details, but I remember it being a full year."
16-02-2019T18:24:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,same lann
16-02-2019T18:24:46,Ordithus,^
16-02-2019T18:24:54,Darkewulf,shrugs
16-02-2019T18:24:56,unsteddyphoenix,weeebs~
16-02-2019T18:24:57,Mippy,Trace really dose like jumping into relationships doesn’t he?
16-02-2019T18:25:03,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
16-02-2019T18:25:06,unsteddyphoenix,Not wrong mippy
16-02-2019T18:25:07,MuonNeutrino,"yeah, so that means that TDM is a year-ish before saria's death, which was 5 years before the current comic time as given by the dates on the tombstone/journal, so TDM was 6 years before making nat 7 during it"
16-02-2019T18:25:11,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Weeb with us teddy
16-02-2019T18:25:12,Mandag,...and then Saria fucking died.
16-02-2019T18:25:13,vevans0009,Hey interspecie couples are hot.
16-02-2019T18:25:14,BadFoMo,"@Storyteller3010 Uh, there's 4 voting rounds?"
16-02-2019T18:25:23,vevans0009,Hot topics.
16-02-2019T18:25:40,Storyteller3010,ok
16-02-2019T18:25:41,Mandag,But Nora said it took six years though. What tombstones are you referring to?
16-02-2019T18:25:42,MrMongMong,Flora's been pregnant for a a good portion of her adult life. Is that correct?
16-02-2019T18:25:45,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-sadtrace2:*[I believe in love at first sight]
16-02-2019T18:25:59,unsteddyphoenix,He's a hopeless romantic no bully
16-02-2019T18:25:59,CrRAR,very romantic
16-02-2019T18:26:02,Mandag,I only hold the main comic as canon.
16-02-2019T18:26:02,vevans0009,Trace is an exception.
16-02-2019T18:26:14,CatzArt,oh boy these convos are funny
16-02-2019T18:26:15,MuonNeutrino,"@Mandag saria's tombstone is visible, with a date, at the end of chapter 6. the date is also given in the excerpt from trace's journal in chapter 7"
16-02-2019T18:26:18,unsteddyphoenix,I only hold the sketches as canon
16-02-2019T18:26:24,vevans0009,Love in 2nd sight.
16-02-2019T18:26:27,Combak,"Unfortunately, Dragon Masquerade has shown itself to be canon."
16-02-2019T18:26:47,vevans0009,Dat a bad thing?
16-02-2019T18:26:56,CatzArt,I dont know?
16-02-2019T18:26:59,Aimbotexe,"Tom plez, how old is Nat in TDM?"
16-02-2019T18:27:01,BadFoMo,"Also, back, and holy crap, this is one of my votes!"
16-02-2019T18:27:01,Combak,"For someone, yes. XD"
16-02-2019T18:27:02,MuonNeutrino,"both of those are unambiguous in-universe numbers, where nora may well not always be a reliable narrator"
16-02-2019T18:27:15,vevans0009,Nora is unreliable.
16-02-2019T18:27:17,MrMongMong,"Wait, Nora is the narrator?"
16-02-2019T18:27:21,MuonNeutrino,no
16-02-2019T18:27:24,vevans0009,She causes mischef.
16-02-2019T18:27:28,MuonNeutrino,just in the flashback i was referring to
16-02-2019T18:27:32,MrMongMong,Oh. I thought I was missing something important.
16-02-2019T18:27:35,CrimsonQuill,returns from the loo
16-02-2019T18:27:37,MuonNeutrino,where she was telling trace about his past
16-02-2019T18:27:44,CatzArt,wb Quill
16-02-2019T18:27:49,CrimsonQuill,thanks
16-02-2019T18:27:51,MuonNeutrino,"she gives an incorrect number of years, which has caused much confusion"
16-02-2019T18:27:56,vevans0009,Or I am just on Team Reni.
16-02-2019T18:28:00,Mandag,Hm. So it's just an inconsistency then? I can live with that.
16-02-2019T18:28:06,Mippy,Was it a good pee Quill?
16-02-2019T18:28:09,BadFoMo,...What happened to the Laura thing?
16-02-2019T18:28:13,MrMongMong,Who said it was a pee?
16-02-2019T18:28:16,CrimsonQuill,glares at mippy
16-02-2019T18:28:18,vevans0009,pfff
16-02-2019T18:28:19,ZoopBoopLoop,I think he's doing his pick first
16-02-2019T18:28:24,CrimsonQuill,That is my business.
16-02-2019T18:28:42,Mippy,No one poos that quickly Mong...unless they oils
16-02-2019T18:28:43,vevans0009,We talk'n bodily functions now?
16-02-2019T18:28:46,MuonNeutrino,@Mandag the two comics with dates are http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/192/ and http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/222/
16-02-2019T18:28:52,CrRAR,We know it was transformational
16-02-2019T18:28:53,vevans0009,XD
16-02-2019T18:28:55,CrimsonQuill,"For all you know, i could've had a nosebleed in there."

16-02-2019T18:29:09,MarvTheHugPharaoh,wb Thingsbro
16-02-2019T18:29:14,CrimsonQuill,Is it chaotic enough for you Things?
16-02-2019T18:29:17,CrRAR,what matters is you grew as a person.
16-02-2019T18:29:25,Darkewulf,Perhaps the one thing I miss most about living in Japan is Hanami
16-02-2019T18:29:28,CatzArt,hahah
16-02-2019T18:29:29,ThingsAreMoving,I give it 5/7
16-02-2019T18:29:30,microbuss,hiyas TAM
16-02-2019T18:29:36,ThingsAreMoving,could use more rabble
16-02-2019T18:29:39,microbuss,hio Marvy
16-02-2019T18:29:42,vevans0009,Never been there. Afraid to.
16-02-2019T18:29:50,CatzArt,Hiya Micro
16-02-2019T18:29:54,Mippy,Rabbles loud
16-02-2019T18:30:02,Storyteller3010,Well everybody. I had the opportunity to enjoy the livestream for this long. But a new thing has come up and I have to attend to it. So I will not be able to see the fourth image until it comes out. You all have fun and take care
16-02-2019T18:30:03,vevans0009,"Heard about ""panty vending machines"". X<"
16-02-2019T18:30:05,MuonNeutrino,@Mandag meanwhile from maddie's letter in the trial we know it's now 482 http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/581/
16-02-2019T18:30:09,CrimsonQuill,"Japan's started Commercial whaling again though...not good,"
16-02-2019T18:30:11,unsteddyphoenix,buh bye~
16-02-2019T18:30:15,MuonNeutrino,hence 5 years ago
16-02-2019T18:30:16,MrMongMong,So five years.
16-02-2019T18:30:18,CrRAR,see ya
16-02-2019T18:30:21,CatzArt,yeah japan cant do that
16-02-2019T18:30:24,Sammit,Bye Storyteller
16-02-2019T18:30:28,Bgrmystr2,but.. they did it
16-02-2019T18:30:30,CrimsonQuill,Bye Storytelker!
16-02-2019T18:30:34,Storyteller3010,Thanks.
16-02-2019T18:30:37,ProsePro7,Oh kimonos!
16-02-2019T18:30:39,vevans0009,Fish not enough for them?
16-02-2019T18:30:42,Darkewulf,H E C K
16-02-2019T18:30:44,Mandag,"I see. So Nora, the near-omnipotent demigod, was wrong about the dates."
16-02-2019T18:30:44,Darkewulf,stupid net
16-02-2019T18:30:45,Storyteller3010,This was my last chance. Just glad I had the opportunity to see it.
16-02-2019T18:30:47,CatzArt,so we must sink the whaling ships again its fine
16-02-2019T18:30:55,MrMongMong,And they can't just come to a naval meeting with a flag of the same design as the Imperial flag...
16-02-2019T18:30:56,Darkewulf,"I was gonna say, "" I also miss obon"""
16-02-2019T18:31:02,Mippy,Fish suck...it’s all about whale
16-02-2019T18:31:02,Sammit,is being bad for me as well Wulf
16-02-2019T18:31:04,BadFoMo,Last chance?
16-02-2019T18:31:08,MuonNeutrino,"personally i give more weight to the explicitly given years, as there's no reason to expect those to be wrong - they're explicitly given as in-universe information. nora, meanwhile, is a *character* and there's no guarantee she's always right"
16-02-2019T18:31:09,ShaneProductionz,AA
16-02-2019T18:31:11,vevans0009,Didn;t Discovery have a show about killing whalers?
16-02-2019T18:31:20,CatzArt,yup Whale Wars
16-02-2019T18:31:25,MrMongMong,"Killing whales, or whalers?"
16-02-2019T18:31:30,ThingsAreMoving,I thought the japanese hated dolphins not whales
16-02-2019T18:31:33,vevans0009,WHalers.
16-02-2019T18:31:35,Mandag,There's no reason to think Nora's wrong either.
16-02-2019T18:31:37,vevans0009,Not whales.
16-02-2019T18:31:40,MrMongMong,What.
16-02-2019T18:31:42,Aimbotexe,"Nah, south park had a show about killing whalers"
16-02-2019T18:31:42,ThingsAreMoving,at least that's what South Park taught me
16-02-2019T18:31:43,Combak,Both
16-02-2019T18:31:43,CrimsonQuill,"They hunt Minke whales, among others."
16-02-2019T18:31:44,Mandag,But I guess I'll give it a rest for now.
16-02-2019T18:31:57,Aimbotexe,The real whale wars did nothing but slow the process
16-02-2019T18:32:03,Darkewulf,yeah let's just move past that
16-02-2019T18:32:09,Darkewulf,go back to enjoying the comic
16-02-2019T18:32:12,Darkewulf,and the stream
16-02-2019T18:32:13,vevans0009,Where is Moby Dick when you need him?
16-02-2019T18:32:20,vevans0009,Kay.
16-02-2019T18:32:24,Darkewulf,"oh joy, my net is blipping again"
16-02-2019T18:32:24,Mippy,On top of my TV
16-02-2019T18:32:34,Mandag,"Clovis is still a creep for perving on Nat though. Even with the dates people have stated here, Natani is underage as of TDM."
16-02-2019T18:32:41,MuonNeutrino,"@Mandag no obvious indications, yes,but there's no reason she has to be *right* either. she's a character in the comic, she says things that could be false or true. but the gravestone and journal are inanimate objects >.>"

16-02-2019T18:33:27,unsteddyphoenix,I...guess? I can accept that
16-02-2019T18:33:27,Dimensional,Or Rose and Clovis are cousins.
16-02-2019T18:33:33,MuonNeutrino,god i hope not

16-02-2019T18:33:45,Darkewulf,I DO hope this one ends up coloured
16-02-2019T18:33:45,Ordithus,That would be weird
16-02-2019T18:33:53,ThingsAreMoving,"Wow, Clovis's mom was a slut then"

16-02-2019T21:43:45,RimaDraws,mine was 31 votes behind the first place one
16-02-2019T21:43:48,RimaDraws,i was at 50
16-02-2019T21:43:50,Ordithus,"But, Tom did draw something marvelous for it"
16-02-2019T21:44:01,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah he monkey's paws'd it in th ebest way
16-02-2019T21:44:16,RimaDraws,i think that one turned out great
16-02-2019T21:44:22,ElvenHunter84,"Oh, and a Tie today as well"
16-02-2019T21:44:32,Bgrmystr2,tom subverted the hell out of that suggestion
16-02-2019T21:44:35,Bgrmystr2,It was great
16-02-2019T21:44:42,Bgrmystr2,and yeah Phoenix prettymuch summed it up
16-02-2019T21:45:19,ElvenHunter84,"Well, sounds like it was a fun stream. I expected to at least catch the end of it but I guess it finished early this week"
16-02-2019T21:45:28,Ordithus,"Yeah, round 1 was a tie!"
16-02-2019T21:45:54,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah, therell be a makeup stream tomorrow"
16-02-2019T21:46:01,RimaDraws,i didnt notice that at all
16-02-2019T21:46:12,SpazztasticKiwi,I work tomorrow
16-02-2019T21:46:14,ElvenHunter84,"My suggestion got a record low number of votes, that's disheartenening. Ah well"
16-02-2019T21:46:26,Ordithus,"What was yours, if you don't mind?"
16-02-2019T21:46:31,unsteddyphoenix,same~
16-02-2019T21:46:36,Ordithus,Mine did decently this week
16-02-2019T21:46:39,ElvenHunter84,The Keith dick in a box one
16-02-2019T21:46:45,Ordithus,"Oh, yeah, that one XD"
16-02-2019T21:47:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Audience ain’t feelin the lewd as strongly right now it seems
16-02-2019T21:47:53,SpazztasticKiwi,"Just cheeky, as the Kat one we got shows"
16-02-2019T21:48:04,Ordithus,That one was hot and adorable
16-02-2019T21:48:22,RimaDraws,i found kat to be funny
16-02-2019T21:48:42,Ordithus,She's so cute it hurts
16-02-2019T21:48:49,SpazztasticKiwi,“I was fine naked before. Why not now?”
16-02-2019T21:48:54,RimaDraws,lol
16-02-2019T21:49:08,unsteddyphoenix,Shes so cuuute
16-02-2019T21:49:13,Ordithus,"""The wind feels nice~"" :ctwokinds-daydreamingkat:"
16-02-2019T21:49:16,ElvenHunter84,I assume Eric reacted like that because it'd be like seeing your sister naked
16-02-2019T21:49:22,Ordithus,I expect
16-02-2019T21:49:26,unsteddyphoenix,Also she grew up with humans she totally knew what she was doing :ctwokinds-wink:
16-02-2019T21:49:27,Ordithus,"Also, the public nudity"
16-02-2019T21:49:51,SpazztasticKiwi,I wonder why that reaction and not shooting for the nearest cover up for her
16-02-2019T21:50:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Like swiping off the tablecloth
16-02-2019T21:50:12,Ordithus,That will come later
16-02-2019T21:50:32,ElvenHunter84,Standing up would have caused an even bigger problem
16-02-2019T21:50:50,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t believe Eric was that effected
16-02-2019T21:50:56,SpazztasticKiwi,At least not in that way
16-02-2019T21:51:09,unsteddyphoenix,"Even if they werent siblings, eric is furssexual"
16-02-2019T21:51:29,Ordithus,"As someone said, this was the only surefire way to make sure he was even less attracted to her"
16-02-2019T21:51:36,Ordithus,Even if it sure works on me <3
16-02-2019T21:51:59,RimaDraws,i like eric's reaction
16-02-2019T21:52:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Convenient censorship
16-02-2019T21:52:17,unsteddyphoenix,I dislike it.
16-02-2019T21:52:20,Ordithus,*inconvenient
16-02-2019T21:52:23,unsteddyphoenix,Get out of the WAY eric
16-02-2019T21:52:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Meh
16-02-2019T21:53:12,RimaDraws,that pic was 10/10 overall <3
16-02-2019T21:53:29,unsteddyphoenix,Agreeed :ctwokinds-KatDance:
16-02-2019T21:53:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I got something possibly better
16-02-2019T21:54:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Pizza rolls
16-02-2019T21:55:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Now Bagheera has been a very good boi today so he gets treats
16-02-2019T21:55:32,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-maevecute:
16-02-2019T21:55:41,RimaDraws,awww
16-02-2019T21:55:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Anyone want me to give him one in their name
16-02-2019T21:55:56,unsteddyphoenix,mememe
16-02-2019T21:55:58,Ordithus,Yes!!!!!
16-02-2019T21:56:19,RimaDraws,mow
16-02-2019T21:56:56,SpazztasticKiwi,He says crunchcrunchcrunch

16-02-2019T21:57:23,unsteddyphoenix,Yesssss
16-02-2019T21:57:48,RimaDraws,<3
16-02-2019T21:59:21,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s something to celebrate. Normally he doesn’t chew
16-02-2019T22:01:27,Ordithus,Cats usually don't do the chewing thing a whole lot
16-02-2019T22:05:51,ElvenHunter84,I feel like Pizza Rolls might upset kitty's tummy
16-02-2019T22:06:10,RimaDraws,yea maybe shouldnt feed your kitty people food
16-02-2019T22:07:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I gave him cat treats
16-02-2019T22:07:28,ElvenHunter84,"Oh, that's better"
16-02-2019T22:07:34,RimaDraws,was responding to elven
16-02-2019T22:07:44,ElvenHunter84,I thought you gave him one of your pizza rolls
16-02-2019T22:12:45,ElvenHunter84,Do you think a Pokemon themed suggestion would have a chance?
16-02-2019T22:13:14,RimaDraws,hmm not sure.
16-02-2019T22:13:30,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah, I think so"
16-02-2019T22:13:37,ElvenHunter84,"Tom's drawn some Pokemon stuff before, but Idk how much he knows about some of the newer pokes"
16-02-2019T22:13:49,unsteddyphoenix,One of the pokes he drew was the newer one
16-02-2019T22:13:57,unsteddyphoenix,The poisonfire lizard
16-02-2019T22:14:01,ElvenHunter84,I wanted him to draw Lucario fighting Zeraora
16-02-2019T22:14:21,ElvenHunter84,"One of those is in Smash, so he at least knows 50% of them"
16-02-2019T22:14:45,ElvenHunter84,"Plus, they're like the only 2 furbait pokemon he hasnt drawn yet"
16-02-2019T22:15:23,unsteddyphoenix,Ummm

16-02-2019T22:16:27,unsteddyphoenix,The girl that holds up the fight cards
16-02-2019T22:20:59,Dadrobit,Howdy y'all!

16-02-2019T22:31:59,Dadrobit,"There's a Christmas episode, but I haven't gotten around to that one yet"
16-02-2019T22:32:50,RimaDraws,i already watched it
16-02-2019T22:33:00,Dadrobit,Might do that tonight myself then.

16-02-2019T22:33:23,Dadrobit,Mid February is the best time to get hype aout Christmas.
16-02-2019T22:33:32,Dadrobit,about*
16-02-2019T22:33:37,ElvenHunter84,Speaking of Anime
16-02-2019T22:33:46,ElvenHunter84,Is My Hero Academia worth watching?
16-02-2019T22:34:20,unsteddyphoenix,"the first time I watched it, I didnt like it"
16-02-2019T22:34:25,unsteddyphoenix,Then I went back to it and enjoyed it
16-02-2019T22:35:42,Dadrobit,":( splitting headache, actually making it hard to justify Netflix right now."
16-02-2019T22:36:31,Dadrobit,Went to the arcade w/ pops. Had a great time. But fuck me in a sideways sprint if they don't have to play their music so damned loud.
16-02-2019T22:38:55,RimaDraws,well still i enjoyed neo yokio. if there is more coming soon ill watch it.
16-02-2019T22:39:04,RimaDraws,i need to watch my hero academia
16-02-2019T22:39:44,Bgrmystr2,Yes Elven
16-02-2019T22:42:20,SpazztasticKiwi,I was invited to Winter Jam a bit ago
16-02-2019T22:42:21,Bgrmystr2,"Also, I watched the movie the other day, was pretty good."
16-02-2019T22:42:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Wanna talk headache and loud music? You can feel your everything vibrate at Winter Jam
16-02-2019T22:43:01,SpazztasticKiwi,The BUILDING vibrates
16-02-2019T22:46:35,qwe304,"imo tom should tie the voting to patron, that would discourage future interferance"
16-02-2019T22:52:23,RimaDraws,i got a 93 on my geology exam last week!
16-02-2019T22:52:29,Ordithus,Congrats Rima
16-02-2019T22:53:14,RimaDraws,ty!
16-02-2019T22:55:09,ElvenHunter84,I think a better idea would be to occasionally have a week where only 10$+ patrons can vote
16-02-2019T22:55:20,ElvenHunter84,but make that like once a month tops
16-02-2019T22:56:45,qwe304,thats basically the color vote tho
16-02-2019T22:56:49,Dadrobit,That's called the color vote. Or was that the joke?
16-02-2019T22:57:22,Dadrobit,"Also, I don't think Patreon exclusivity is gonna fly. The backlash would just be too much."
16-02-2019T22:57:51,Bgrmystr2,the whole idea was NOT being paid exclusive to vote and view art
16-02-2019T22:57:55,Bgrmystr2,bar the color votes lol
16-02-2019T22:59:14,Dadrobit,be back in a bit.
16-02-2019T23:00:53,Ordithus,"Speaking of color vote, I'm going to need moar votes."
16-02-2019T23:07:06,ElvenHunter84,Can't decide on 3?
16-02-2019T23:09:01,Ordithus,There were 3 just from today :ptv-laugh:
16-02-2019T23:12:14,ElvenHunter84,I forget what half the suggestions for this month were
16-02-2019T23:12:25,ElvenHunter84,"besides like 4 ""X as a fox"" ones"
16-02-2019T23:12:32,Ordithus,"Yeah, that"
16-02-2019T23:13:55,Ordithus,"Aside from today's pieces, we had such gems as cheerleader Raine, Addie Suplex, bathing Laura, Maddie being oh so lewd (ankles), book club..."
16-02-2019T23:14:14,Ordithus,"And I just know I will need to vote for human Laura, and it's not even done"
16-02-2019T23:14:25,ElvenHunter84,Were there any WW2 pinups this month?
16-02-2019T23:14:44,Ordithus,Don't think so
16-02-2019T23:17:15,ElvenHunter84,"So far I think I'm voting for Laura Bathtime, Laura Bathtime 2, and hopefully one more good one comes out of the makeup stream"
16-02-2019T23:18:30,qwe304,"@ElvenHunter84 one was suggested, not voted tho"
16-02-2019T23:18:49,Ordithus,Many were suggested
16-02-2019T23:19:05,ElvenHunter84,"What was suggested, the stream?"
16-02-2019T23:19:13,qwe304,ww2 pinups
16-02-2019T23:19:16,ElvenHunter84,oh
16-02-2019T23:19:16,unsteddyphoenix,the stream was suggested
16-02-2019T23:19:25,Ordithus,*suggestive
16-02-2019T23:19:52,ElvenHunter84,Does anyone know if that Mike and Evals sailor pinup was supposed to be WW2 themed?
16-02-2019T23:20:08,ElvenHunter84,"It said naval guns, so I assumed a battleship, not like the cannons on the Na'rella"
16-02-2019T23:20:38,Ordithus,I dunno
16-02-2019T23:22:55,Ordithus,"Cute as those boys may be, they wouldn't be beefcake unless Nora'd or something"
16-02-2019T23:23:16,unsteddyphoenix,Someday I wanna force Tom to draw beefy mike
16-02-2019T23:23:23,unsteddyphoenix,Just to watch him struggle~
16-02-2019T23:24:08,Ordithus,":ptv-laugh: I got to give him credit, he did make Mike kinda sexy in a cute way"
16-02-2019T23:26:35,ElvenHunter84,All foxes are twinks
16-02-2019T23:26:38,ElvenHunter84,and that's okay
16-02-2019T23:27:44,unsteddyphoenix,No
16-02-2019T23:27:51,unsteddyphoenix,"Break the system, fight the mold"
16-02-2019T23:28:18,unsteddyphoenix,"Busty Laura and Buff Mike, coming soon the a stream near you"

16-02-2019T23:31:19,RimaDraws,lol
16-02-2019T23:35:33,ElvenHunter84,Alright. I'm gonna hit the hay. I'll try to make it to the makeup stream if there is one
16-02-2019T23:35:47,Ordithus,Night Elven
16-02-2019T23:35:54,ElvenHunter84,there are only like 2 more sketches so I don't think there needs to be a stream
16-02-2019T23:36:07,ElvenHunter84,unless Tom decides to also draw Human Laura and the Kat Ref
16-02-2019T23:36:23,InTheLionsDen,"Yes, he said he planned on trying to do the four."
16-02-2019T23:37:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Probably what he’s doodling now
16-02-2019T23:37:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Autocorrect just nearly turned the beginning of probably into pterodactyl
16-02-2019T23:40:08,RimaDraws,o.o lol
