13-04-2019T13:51:37,BluePhantom90,hey all
13-04-2019T13:51:44,CrimsonQuill,hullo
13-04-2019T13:51:50,CrimsonQuill,:ptv-greetings:
13-04-2019T13:52:20,BluePhantom90,is Tom around?
13-04-2019T13:52:33,CrimsonQuill,I don't think so
13-04-2019T13:53:07,Dominik1999,moin
13-04-2019T13:53:16,CrimsonQuill,Evening
13-04-2019T13:54:02,BluePhantom90,Just just wanted to ask about something.
13-04-2019T13:54:04,Twokinds,?
13-04-2019T13:54:13,BluePhantom90,Oh hello Tom
13-04-2019T13:54:15,CrimsonQuill,"Oooh, hello Tom"
13-04-2019T13:54:30,CrimsonQuill,You are here after all.
13-04-2019T13:54:32,CrimsonQuill,:)
13-04-2019T13:54:36,CrimsonQuill,:ptv-victory:
13-04-2019T13:55:54,BluePhantom90,well anyways I just wanted to talk about my Suggestion I posted for the sketch idea. I added a little detail to it just not trying to push the envelope to much
13-04-2019T13:56:57,Twokinds,?
13-04-2019T13:57:17,BluePhantom90,well may I whisper to you?
13-04-2019T13:58:11,Twokinds,Okay
13-04-2019T13:59:11,iliar,Tom can ask? Have you already downloaded the suggestions?
13-04-2019T13:59:51,Twokinds,Yes
13-04-2019T14:01:10,iliar,I just made a mistake. much easier -> much lighter
13-04-2019T14:02:53,Twokinds,"Oh, okay"
13-04-2019T14:02:57,RimaDraws,hi tom
13-04-2019T14:02:59,Twokinds,Your extra details were culled anyway
13-04-2019T14:03:56,iliar,I know. But you asked to be more specific in suggestions.
13-04-2019T14:06:08,Combak,Hey all.
13-04-2019T14:06:24,BluePhantom90,hey
13-04-2019T14:06:34,CrimsonQuill,Evening Combak
13-04-2019T14:08:19,BluePhantom90,-sighs- r-r have to do a small edit brb
13-04-2019T14:09:03,BluePhantom90,and done
13-04-2019T14:09:43,Twokinds,That's not what I mean by specific. I just mean that suggestions should describe the scene I should draw. They need to be visual.
13-04-2019T14:10:01,BluePhantom90,ah
13-04-2019T14:10:19,Twokinds,"""Maeve meeting Mrs Nibbly"" isn't very specific, because it's open ended. ""Maeve chasing Mrs Nibbly"" isn't any longer, but it's specfic."
13-04-2019T14:11:22,RimaDraws,true
13-04-2019T14:11:23,CrimsonQuill,"Yeah, clear and concise"
13-04-2019T14:11:50,CrimsonQuill,My suggestions for example are a bit too long winded and need slimming down.
13-04-2019T14:11:51,BluePhantom90,Well It would be a long one so kinda leaving it  to your creative idea's.
13-04-2019T14:12:07,CrimsonQuill,It's kind of hard to strike a balance.....
13-04-2019T14:12:37,Xexanoth,all i'm getting out of this example is the question: who has the fluffier tail Anthro-Nibbly or Maeve? :ptv-wondering:
13-04-2019T14:12:38,BluePhantom90,-shrugs- Mine I am kinda putting U.S. History into Twokinds for possible story building..
13-04-2019T14:12:48,Twokinds,Nibs for sure
13-04-2019T14:12:57,Dimensional,Keidran Nibbly becomes an Adrakist by the power of Reni! XP
13-04-2019T14:13:05,iliar,Sorry. Briefly expressing your thoughts is difficult for me.
13-04-2019T14:13:24,Twokinds,"Your suggestion is fine, iliar."
13-04-2019T14:13:24,BluePhantom90,Kinda like that whole Snep Village story building that kinda went out of hand
13-04-2019T14:14:23,CrimsonQuill,"Heh, if I could, my suggestions would be veritable encyclopediae of info. Too much info, for that matter."
13-04-2019T14:14:41,Xexanoth,and that's why you have to keep it short...
13-04-2019T14:14:54,Xexanoth,otherwise people are gonna post their entire fanfictions as a sketch suggestion
13-04-2019T14:15:07,iliar,"When you do not know the language, it is better to speak long. Even if you make a mistake, another person still understand you."
13-04-2019T14:15:10,CrimsonQuill,Yep.
13-04-2019T14:15:14,BluePhantom90,I want to make it more detailed but I would make it almost a full paragraph which doesn't work for votes
13-04-2019T14:15:29,CrimsonQuill,I kept my fanfiction/backstory for the comments.
13-04-2019T14:15:35,CrimsonQuill,LOL
13-04-2019T14:17:38,BluePhantom90,"r-r I have my own characters and kinda fanfic of Twokinds, but My characters would have only met 1 or 2 characters in Twokinds. Not super important characters."
13-04-2019T14:21:39,BluePhantom90,though my character has a magical issue
13-04-2019T14:22:29,CrimsonQuill,Mine was just the backstory for the Halo pic
13-04-2019T14:24:24,Twokinds,Patreon messages is bugged and now always says I have 1 new message despite there not being any.
13-04-2019T14:24:31,Twokinds,That's annoying.
13-04-2019T14:24:46,BluePhantom90,yeah its annoying
13-04-2019T14:25:10,Combak,"Sorry if anyone else said hi, my connection is bugging out atm."
13-04-2019T14:25:26,Combak,"And it deleted my message saying ""Hi Quill."""
13-04-2019T14:26:42,RimaDraws,oh that is weird

13-04-2019T14:36:48,CrimsonQuill,With great difficulty.
13-04-2019T14:36:55,CrimsonQuill,And the aid of a herding stick.
13-04-2019T14:37:04,Mippy,I don't belive they'd like being stuffed in s trunk
13-04-2019T14:37:11,CrimsonQuill,It's a rooy shed.
13-04-2019T14:37:13,CrimsonQuill,roomy
13-04-2019T14:37:27,CrimsonQuill,Just that the geese are being broody and don't want to share...

13-04-2019T14:44:36,NeonMitsumi,Any brownie is two-bite if you're determined enough.
13-04-2019T14:44:49,Twokinds,Fluff's spell managed to save the day yesterday during D&D
13-04-2019T14:45:01,Mippy,XD Can't argure with that Neon
13-04-2019T14:45:02,CrimsonQuill,How so?

13-04-2019T14:45:32,Twokinds,Defeated the boss with one massive god-tier spell
13-04-2019T14:45:36,CrimsonQuill,Woah.
13-04-2019T14:45:38,Twokinds,Leaving a splatter on the wall.
13-04-2019T14:45:39,Combak,What was it?
13-04-2019T14:45:43,CrimsonQuill,Niiiice.
13-04-2019T14:45:51,Mippy,XD Holy Crap
13-04-2019T14:46:01,Combak,"What spell, I mean."
13-04-2019T14:46:31,BluePhantom90,bet the spell cost him a something
13-04-2019T14:46:39,BadFoMo,Yo.
13-04-2019T14:46:43,Combak,Hi FoMo
13-04-2019T14:46:44,Twokinds,"The spell freezes an enemy for one round, and hitting the enemy stored up kinetic energy and was released all at once when they unfreeze."
13-04-2019T14:46:52,Twokinds,Boss went flying at 500mph into a wall.
13-04-2019T14:46:58,Glassan,Nice

13-04-2019T14:47:07,Mippy,Awesome
13-04-2019T14:47:10,Combak,So the Breath of the Wild Stasis rune?
13-04-2019T14:47:12,CrimsonQuill,That is an awesome spell.
13-04-2019T14:47:16,BadFoMo,Dang...
13-04-2019T14:47:18,CrimsonQuill,I need to play D and D
13-04-2019T14:47:35,Twokinds,Pretty much
13-04-2019T14:47:58,BluePhantom90,-sighs- wish I can find a decent DnD group. e-e Everyone I find seems fun but then their are those that want to play the game but not build on story
13-04-2019T14:48:38,BluePhantom90,or just play on their phone and be robots on auto-pilot
13-04-2019T14:49:00,Mippy,But dosn't part of the immersiveness of a table to RPG depend on that story
13-04-2019T14:49:55,Mippy,Geezze...some people
13-04-2019T14:49:59,RimaDraws,i am playing now
13-04-2019T14:50:21,Combak,Cool.
13-04-2019T14:50:24,BluePhantom90,"yeah but When you play Adventures League its more of the Game then the story. Your character would just appear with the group. No "" You spot a man from the distance"""
13-04-2019T14:50:33,Glassan,I find it also depends on what all the players want out of the game.
13-04-2019T14:50:43,Mippy,I am not playing...but I'm reading up...on and off
13-04-2019T14:50:50,CrimsonQuill,I just want fun...if I ever play.
13-04-2019T14:50:55,CrimsonQuill,I could make a dwarf.
13-04-2019T14:51:04,CrimsonQuill,Can you make any race in the game?
13-04-2019T14:51:16,Glassan,"Well, one person's fun may be someone else's boring."
13-04-2019T14:51:17,Mippy,I think I'd be more of a story player
13-04-2019T14:51:33,Mippy,I love a good story
13-04-2019T14:51:42,BadFoMo,@Glassan /Verry/ trus.
13-04-2019T14:51:42,Glassan,"Agreed, Mippy. Same here."
13-04-2019T14:51:58,BadFoMo,*?very/ true.
13-04-2019T14:52:05,Glassan,I've played with others that only focused on 'winning'
13-04-2019T14:52:13,Glassan,i.e. having the biggest numbers.
13-04-2019T14:52:14,BadFoMo,AH! *?Very/
13-04-2019T14:52:19,Combak,AKA Power gamers.

13-04-2019T14:52:27,Glassan,And that got grating very fast.
13-04-2019T14:52:42,BadFoMo,SOB!! */Very/
13-04-2019T14:52:49,Mippy,That dose not sound very fun Glassan

13-04-2019T14:53:21,BadFoMo,...I think my brain may be still half asleep./
13-04-2019T14:53:21,Twokinds,lol

13-04-2019T14:53:45,BluePhantom90,"I have another two of a Human Sorcerer with dragon bloodline, and a Warforge Eldritch Knight"
13-04-2019T14:53:46,Mippy,"Well, wacky is good"
13-04-2019T14:53:50,Twokinds,"My character was focused entirely on being the best cook, and being the fasters halfling ever"
13-04-2019T14:53:57,Twokinds,And she succeeded!
13-04-2019T14:54:01,Mippy,XD
13-04-2019T14:54:08,BadFoMo,Halfling?
13-04-2019T14:54:09,CrimsonQuill,I like that.
13-04-2019T14:54:17,CrimsonQuill,Is that halfling as in Hobbit?
13-04-2019T14:54:20,Glassan,"When you have a drunken, dwarven druid that turns into power-drinking angry bear that growls tavern songs, everything gets fun."
13-04-2019T14:54:25,CrimsonQuill,Or halfling as in some other thing?
13-04-2019T14:54:26,Mippy,Sounds good tp me Tom
13-04-2019T14:54:26,Glassan,Even when no story takes place.
13-04-2019T14:54:28,Twokinds,But she was definitely not the strongest because of that focus. XD
13-04-2019T14:54:44,CrimsonQuill,I could use my OC Julia Custodes.....

13-04-2019T16:26:47,Bgrmystr2,Flora was pregnant in the story when he drew the character sheet in 2015 but she wasn't pregonat in the ref sheet itself.
13-04-2019T16:26:52,BadFoMo,Go further down the page?
13-04-2019T16:26:53,Bgrmystr2,so I'm not expecting it

13-04-2019T16:28:18,Mippy,She’s probably gonna be purgnant for a bit longer

13-04-2019T16:33:32,MviluUatusun,"Rima, I'm jealous of that.  Mine used to be like that a couple of years ago."
13-04-2019T16:33:35,Mippy,Mine is very low....due to my low blood count
13-04-2019T16:33:45,RimaDraws,mine used to be 160 or 140 some but since i started to work out i am better
13-04-2019T16:33:46,SissyHairball,Get more blood in ye

13-04-2019T16:34:07,MviluUatusun,Mippy is a vampire in waiting.

13-04-2019T16:45:31,MviluUatusun,"Yeah, unfortunately, most of the time when something goes on hiatus, it means, ""I'm not doing it any more."""
13-04-2019T16:45:54,RimaDraws,not me
13-04-2019T16:46:17,Twokinds,Sad truth

13-04-2019T16:46:30,MviluUatusun,The author of the story says it's on hiatus until he finishes his exams.
13-04-2019T16:46:47,Twokinds,"So many webcomics, still on hiatus"
13-04-2019T16:46:49,Bgrmystr2,"hiatus always comes with the possibility that they don't continue it, but it's not a guarantee"
13-04-2019T16:47:10,MviluUatusun,"But, the last chapter was uploaded over a year ago."

13-04-2019T16:49:05,w0lfmare,Go on haitus every time you take a food break
13-04-2019T16:49:12,fanir,one minute hiatus for a very quick nap?
13-04-2019T16:49:28,MviluUatusun,"But, all of you are right.  I've found some great comics and while I'm trying to get caught up, the artist says the comic's going on temporary hiatus and the next thing I know, I can't find it any more."
13-04-2019T16:49:45,RimaDraws,i need to start mine asap
13-04-2019T16:50:00,Bgrmystr2,"I think people use the ""hiatus"" incorrectly"
13-04-2019T16:50:01,vevans0009,"Damn, Mvilu. 8o"
13-04-2019T16:50:13,Bgrmystr2,and that's why people associate it with things discontinuing
13-04-2019T16:50:18,Bgrmystr2,when it's just a mis-used term.
13-04-2019T16:50:34,MviluUatusun,"I really need to get back to writing, updating, my story so I can eventually upload it."
13-04-2019T16:50:37,andrewfr8man,"Well then. Been a day, 3"" of snow in the middle of April..."
13-04-2019T16:50:42,RimaDraws,are you saying i misuse it?
13-04-2019T16:50:47,Bgrmystr2,no
13-04-2019T16:50:48,vevans0009,"Like saying ""its been awhile"".  When its been like decade."
13-04-2019T16:50:50,Twokinds,Yeah I hate when artists take their stuff down
13-04-2019T16:50:52,MarvTheHugPharaoh,lucky Andrew
13-04-2019T16:51:02,RimaDraws,ive taken old art down because it looked like trash
13-04-2019T16:51:03,Bgrmystr2,"I'm saying some people use ""hiatus"" and then don't plan to continue the work at all"
13-04-2019T16:51:06,MviluUatusun,"Andrew, you must be wrong.  Global warming means it doesn't snow any more."
13-04-2019T16:51:19,Twokinds,"Like, I know it's their work and their right to do so, but when you put a story or a comic or whatever out there, it becomes a part of other peole's lives. It's sad to see it disappear."
13-04-2019T16:51:29,vevans0009,^^^
13-04-2019T16:51:34,FloofyCat,I'd certainly be sad if TK suddenly went poof.

13-04-2019T16:52:01,RimaDraws,ive honestly thought about shutting down my patreon many times.

13-04-2019T16:52:36,FloofyCat,Oh gosh I hate cliffhangers.
13-04-2019T16:52:42,sunblaze,bye
13-04-2019T16:52:52,sunblaze,(why dod that picarto link enter there? strange
13-04-2019T16:52:53,FloofyCat,Thankfully Tom has all his stuff saved.
13-04-2019T16:53:00,FenceEqualizer,"""And then they all died...The End"""
13-04-2019T16:53:06,FloofyCat,"Wait, Tom, do you store all your comics in cloud storage or on hard drives?"
13-04-2019T16:53:06,InTheLionsDen,But they think they will finish it so they don't want to reveal their intended story.
13-04-2019T16:53:11,MviluUatusun,"Fence, LOL."
13-04-2019T16:53:13,Sclimshady,rocks fall everyone dies
13-04-2019T16:53:19,Xexanoth,@Fence i guess someone pissed of the GM
13-04-2019T16:53:29,w0lfmare,I think most comics that go on haitus hope that they have the chance to come back to it
13-04-2019T16:53:31,vevans0009,An asteroid came down and killed everyone.
13-04-2019T16:53:51,MviluUatusun,"Yeah, that's possible, w0lf."
13-04-2019T16:53:56,Bgrmystr2,"I see a lot of people misuse the term ""Hiatus"" when they should use ""Discontinued"""
13-04-2019T16:54:15,Bgrmystr2,and do that intentionally because they get a lot of negative feedback from the latter
13-04-2019T16:54:19,w0lfmare,But really there's not a lot of stand on with a free comic
13-04-2019T16:54:21,vevans0009,"How about ""cancelled""?"
13-04-2019T16:54:22,Bgrmystr2,which only makes it look worse for them
13-04-2019T16:54:34,FenceEqualizer,I'm guessing they don't want to say Discontinued cause they're not sure if they're done done.
13-04-2019T16:54:42,Bgrmystr2,that wouldn't fit Vevans lol
13-04-2019T16:54:44,Mippy,Unless you are CLAMP....then you go on a 20 year hiatus
13-04-2019T16:54:49,Twokinds,I don't think I've ever seen a webcomic revive after being on hiatus for over a year or two
13-04-2019T16:54:51,vevans0009,oh god.
13-04-2019T16:54:53,FloofyCat,Hunter x Hiatus
13-04-2019T16:54:59,Aimbotexe,Prequel?
13-04-2019T16:55:29,Corinthian,I don't think Prequel ever went on an official hiatus.
13-04-2019T16:55:30,vevans0009,Alpha Luna webcomic took a hit.
13-04-2019T16:55:32,FloofyCat,"Hey Tom, if you have all your stuff saved on hard drives, I hope you have a second copy, because I've lost weeks of work to hard drive bad sectors before."
13-04-2019T16:55:37,w0lfmare,"I know I've seen at least one, but it's never the same"
13-04-2019T16:55:41,RimaDraws,that one webcomic that never came back is what made me miss it. altermeta
13-04-2019T16:55:43,vevans0009,I am sad.
13-04-2019T16:55:51,Twokinds,"Oh yeah, all my pages is redundantly backed up"
13-04-2019T16:55:56,FloofyCat,Oh good \o/
13-04-2019T16:56:01,Mandag,"Prequel's hiatus was never ""official"""
13-04-2019T16:56:06,vevans0009,"God bless u, Tom."
13-04-2019T16:56:09,Aimbotexe,"Not official yeah, but two years without updates?"
13-04-2019T16:56:16,RunionKorner,If your taking ideas: Natani breast expansion
13-04-2019T16:56:19,Mandag,"It was just TWO YEARS of ""It's coming soon guys trust me"""
13-04-2019T16:56:26,FloofyCat,"Every time I've had bad sectors, it's actually ended up destroying Windows files. Every time it becomes unbootable, lul."
13-04-2019T16:56:32,Corinthian,@Aimbotexe Tbf he was working on that flash game for the update.
13-04-2019T16:56:33,BadFoMo,@Twokinds How redundantly?
13-04-2019T16:56:41,vevans0009,Said artist must be delusional
13-04-2019T16:56:43,OrangeLimes,I have SAS drives working in RAID 5 for redundancy even then total storage is about 6TB
13-04-2019T16:56:47,Bgrmystr2,he probably never went on hiatus because he worked on it here and there in his free time
13-04-2019T16:56:48,Aimbotexe,And it dropped harder than my... Back account
13-04-2019T16:56:50,FloofyCat,I got a SSD to plop Windows on because Hard Drives have only a 2-6 year life span.
13-04-2019T16:56:53,Bgrmystr2,"and technically, that's not hiatus."
13-04-2019T16:57:04,w0lfmare,Ask enough people and you could probably find all of twokinds saved offline by fans XD
13-04-2019T16:57:04,ZoopBoopLoop,...should there a preggers variant
13-04-2019T16:57:20,Bgrmystr2,"well yeah the comic is reposted a bunch of places, w0lf"

13-04-2019T16:58:52,FloofyCat,Her tail looks like Keith's tail.
13-04-2019T16:58:58,RimaDraws,its a nice ref
13-04-2019T16:58:58,Bgrmystr2,"mhm, closed raid inside of a separate raid, eh?"
13-04-2019T16:59:11,OrangeLimes,No...
13-04-2019T16:59:13,w0lfmare,"I really need to sell more books, but I stink at marketing"
13-04-2019T16:59:15,Bgrmystr2,yeah i didn't think so

13-04-2019T17:00:24,Bgrmystr2,Why does it have to be only practical
13-04-2019T17:00:27,Mippy,Awwww...I understand W0lf. I suck too
13-04-2019T17:00:37,Sclimshady,good thing we still have like 20 years until she gives birth
13-04-2019T17:00:42,Bgrmystr2,can't just do it for the fuck of it? For science? You monster?
13-04-2019T17:01:02,146Time,And don't forget the 3 years she's going to spend doing it
13-04-2019T17:01:08,146Time,thanks to NARRATIVE TIME

13-04-2019T17:01:39,FloofyCat,Still one of the most regularly updated webcomics that looks extremely good
13-04-2019T17:01:54,FloofyCat,I don't think I've seen a better drawn comic that updates as regularly tbh

13-04-2019T17:02:24,FloofyCat,Flora's pregnancy I assume
13-04-2019T17:03:30,FloofyCat,In before all along the pregnancy wasn't even real and Nora was just messing with everyone all this time.
13-04-2019T17:04:03,146Time,Flora was just getting fat
13-04-2019T17:04:06,Mippy,Tuberculosis
13-04-2019T17:04:18,vevans0009,At least her breasts will be bigger during and after pregancy.
13-04-2019T17:04:28,FloofyCat,Ya' say that
13-04-2019T17:04:35,Mippy,Big bobs are overrated
13-04-2019T17:04:37,Sclimshady,she'll be happy about that

13-04-2019T17:06:45,vevans0009,As far as he goes is kissing embraces.
13-04-2019T17:06:59,Sclimshady,it is if you dont care what people think
13-04-2019T17:07:06,CrRAR,The can do attitude is strong in this one~

13-04-2019T20:58:56,Bgrmystr2,Probably because Natani was not likely prepared for Kat not even looking

13-04-2019T21:05:42,unsteddyphoenix,Basitins do have anime strength though
13-04-2019T21:05:47,vevans0009,Basitins are like Saiyans.
13-04-2019T21:05:48,Ordithus,True
13-04-2019T21:05:48,MuonNeutrino,@Bgrmystr2 the point more was that the way keith talked about it to himself makes it sound like he thinks nat is stronger than he is
13-04-2019T21:05:51,Bgrmystr2,just cuz you're not prepared for someone to be as strong as they are does not mean they are stronger.
13-04-2019T21:05:56,Ordithus,Keith and Alaric did destroy a bridge
13-04-2019T21:06:08,CrRAR,yeah
13-04-2019T21:06:09,Bgrmystr2,or just very strong in general
13-04-2019T21:06:15,Katfeathers,there is no spoon
13-04-2019T21:06:18,Mippy,Basitin are little power houses
13-04-2019T21:06:21,Bgrmystr2,not really comparison
13-04-2019T21:06:21,unsteddyphoenix,Theyre really DENSE
13-04-2019T21:06:25,Twokinds,Yeah Basitin strength is slightly further along on the anime scale
13-04-2019T21:06:32,CrRAR,Basitin DPW was probably just underfunded.
13-04-2019T21:06:34,MuonNeutrino,"the bridge thing is pure anime, that doesn't make sense regardless of how strong they are XD"
13-04-2019T21:06:36,vevans0009,And live longer lives.
13-04-2019T21:06:40,Twokinds,XD Deceptively strong
13-04-2019T21:06:40,MuonNeutrino,it's artistic license
13-04-2019T21:06:42,Taremong,Where does Adelaide go on that scale?
13-04-2019T21:06:44,FenceEqualizer,So if Humans didn't have magic they'd be screwed?
13-04-2019T21:06:48,Bgrmystr2,well duh?
13-04-2019T21:06:53,RimaDraws,great job on the sketches today tom
13-04-2019T21:06:57,Bgrmystr2,that's what makes them able to stand up to the others
13-04-2019T21:07:03,FenceEqualizer,:gun:
13-04-2019T21:07:14,unsteddyphoenix,I think they bridge thing was alaric smashing it with magically enhanced strength
13-04-2019T21:07:17,CrimsonHelsing,"to be fair I think that bridge had flawed construction, or it was getting weak over time anyway"
13-04-2019T21:07:17,unsteddyphoenix,Maybe?
13-04-2019T21:07:20,Mippy,That’s why the Templar wanted to take out the Basitins. They are a threat
13-04-2019T21:07:22,steelabjur,Adelaide is lift a whole wagon plus horse strong. ;p
13-04-2019T21:07:22,CrRAR,true
13-04-2019T21:07:23,Twokinds,Yeah Basitin have to have something to counterbalance the lack of magic
13-04-2019T21:07:25,unsteddyphoenix,"Whos stronger Tom, Natani or Keith"
13-04-2019T21:07:30,LannAF,the stronk

13-04-2019T21:07:45,vevans0009,Staying out of this.
13-04-2019T21:07:57,unsteddyphoenix,"Honestly even with the anime strength, the utility of magic is too useful. Basitins got the raw end"
13-04-2019T21:08:08,Bgrmystr2,unless you're the king
13-04-2019T21:08:13,Twokinds,"It depends. Natani outweights Keith be a considerable amount, so it's a totally different weight class. But Basitin strength closes the gap."
13-04-2019T21:08:13,FenceEqualizer,They do have magical defense though
13-04-2019T21:08:25,unsteddyphoenix,What if they arm wrestled
13-04-2019T21:08:32,FenceEqualizer,"Or rather I guess like a shield, since if they take too much they take like double damage."
13-04-2019T21:08:40,Twokinds,And Keith's better skilled.
13-04-2019T21:08:41,vevans0009,Basitans are Keidran 2.0

13-04-2019T21:09:01,Twokinds,If they arm wrestled? Hmm... I don't want to say who would win.
13-04-2019T21:09:04,ProsePro7,Keith beat both Natani and Zen so he can take Natani one on one
13-04-2019T21:09:06,CrimsonHelsing,iirc they are generally stronger than humans too

13-04-2019T22:06:57,Ordithus,Hi!
13-04-2019T22:07:09,Dadrobit,o/
13-04-2019T22:08:19,Ordithus,"Sushi is pretty good, Dumbo had some hard competition"
13-04-2019T22:09:03,unsteddyphoenix,ay daddy
13-04-2019T22:10:04,Dadrobit,"Alas, the place is no longer a Hibach Grill as well, they swapped out to all you can eat Korean BBQ where the hibachi tables used to be."
13-04-2019T22:10:12,Dadrobit,Gonna have to try that out next time.
13-04-2019T22:11:17,unsteddyphoenix,Luckily a good thing was swapped with a good thing
13-04-2019T22:11:17,Dadrobit,"Ah, and I haven't looked at the votes yet, but any chance Raine x Zen roller coaster made it?"
13-04-2019T22:11:29,unsteddyphoenix,Sadly not this day
13-04-2019T22:11:33,Dadrobit,RIP
13-04-2019T22:11:41,Ordithus,A diff Zen X Raine piece made it ho
13-04-2019T22:11:43,Ordithus,Though
13-04-2019T22:12:06,Dadrobit,"And yeah, tonight was pure sushi, next time though, definitely gonna hit up that BBQ."
13-04-2019T22:40:31,SpazztasticKiwi,We don’t have many fancy food places here
13-04-2019T22:41:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Did see a panda place in Tupelo a few days ago. Almost visited but the reviews bombed
13-04-2019T22:54:23,RimaDraws,night all!
13-04-2019T23:09:30,Twokinds,I miss rice
13-04-2019T23:11:13,unsteddyphoenix,Um?
13-04-2019T23:11:39,SpazztasticKiwi,...ok?
13-04-2019T23:11:47,unsteddyphoenix,Where did it go?
13-04-2019T23:11:53,unsteddyphoenix,Or was there a person named rice
13-04-2019T23:11:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Are you suddenly allergic
13-04-2019T23:11:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Like

13-04-2019T23:12:24,Ordithus,You can buy rice ya know
13-04-2019T23:12:56,Twokinds,No carb diet
13-04-2019T23:13:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh that still
13-04-2019T23:13:08,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-zenshocked:
13-04-2019T23:13:18,unsteddyphoenix,Oh ew
13-04-2019T23:13:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Any progress?
13-04-2019T23:13:21,unsteddyphoenix,Carbs are life
13-04-2019T23:14:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Every time I loose weight I find it in the refrigerator
13-04-2019T23:14:33,Twokinds,My body vehemently disagrees with my decision to give up sugar.
13-04-2019T23:14:45,unsteddyphoenix,"Wait so. No sugar, no carbs."
13-04-2019T23:14:49,unsteddyphoenix,What...what do you eat?
13-04-2019T23:14:54,Twokinds,And it's even more unhappy about giving up the rest of carbs too.
13-04-2019T23:15:18,unsteddyphoenix,What else is there? Just meat?
13-04-2019T23:15:24,Twokinds,And fat!
13-04-2019T23:15:39,Twokinds,fats and protein.
13-04-2019T23:15:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Keto diet apparently works so it’s possible
13-04-2019T23:15:41,unsteddyphoenix,Well thank god you still have that
13-04-2019T23:16:42,Twokinds,yeah I needed to go lighter on sugar a long time ago.
13-04-2019T23:16:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Though I fail to see why you’d want to lose weight
13-04-2019T23:16:49,Twokinds,My diet was very unhealthy for a while.
13-04-2019T23:17:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Doesn’t everyone have that
13-04-2019T23:17:05,Twokinds,lol
13-04-2019T23:17:07,SageSaga,Sugar is the devil
13-04-2019T23:17:11,Twokinds,I just want to get a little healthier.
13-04-2019T23:17:19,SpazztasticKiwi,But it’s a sweet devil
13-04-2019T23:18:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Grrrreetings Sage
13-04-2019T23:23:51,unsteddyphoenix,Sugar was MADE by the devil
13-04-2019T23:24:35,unsteddyphoenix,Just work out and then you can eat whatever you want! :D
13-04-2019T23:29:40,unsteddyphoenix,benchpress your cat
13-04-2019T23:29:57,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock: that's quite a high hurdle

13-04-2019T23:40:16,TheOtherEric,"I can imagine the adorable little grunts she makes with her little punches. ""Eh...hmph...gah....am i doing it right, Nat?"
13-04-2019T23:41:05,TheOtherEric,"""...sure are, kid"" *Kat's eyes light up like stars*"
