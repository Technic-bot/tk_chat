09-03-2019T00:16:29,Destro35,But the ice worm is a good original idea
09-03-2019T00:22:27,SpazztasticKiwi,The ice worn is a big nope is all it is

09-03-2019T01:10:43,Twokinds,I am too
09-03-2019T01:10:46,Twokinds,Now for the next one
09-03-2019T01:15:27,Bgrmystr2,yeh this page was good. Kind of expecting Rose to have a much broader sense of how much trace changed now that she knows moreso of all the stuff she was limited from knowing beforehand..
09-03-2019T01:19:30,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s that
09-03-2019T01:19:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Not sure on that last look though
09-03-2019T01:20:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I got distracted. But maybe now I’ll go 🛌

09-03-2019T06:16:55,js199456,I wonder why DemonTigerTrace hasnt been colored yet if in the color stream it was anounced as a sponsor color
09-03-2019T06:19:30,Bgrmystr2,He'll probably work on it a bit later. He's got a bunch of other art he has to color as well.
09-03-2019T06:20:02,Bgrmystr2,He may work on it soon. Just depends on how much he has to do.
09-03-2019T06:20:25,js199456,ah opk
09-03-2019T06:20:27,js199456,ok

09-03-2019T13:12:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Mines not too bad
09-03-2019T13:12:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Just seen what trailers show
09-03-2019T13:13:15,SpazztasticKiwi,And what Seán’s seen
09-03-2019T13:13:33,Twokinds,I'm trying my best not to look up anything about it until the full release.
09-03-2019T13:13:55,Azumachan,It might be months
09-03-2019T13:14:55,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s been speculated it may not be till next year
09-03-2019T13:15:33,SpazztasticKiwi,But there’s not much to it. Basically nothing but pretty visuals rn
09-03-2019T13:17:27,SpazztasticKiwi,But I’ve heard from last night you’ve been having time to game break which means progress is 📈
09-03-2019T13:36:29,Twokinds,I don't mind.
09-03-2019T13:36:38,Twokinds,I prefer complete games.

09-03-2019T14:07:12,Dadrobit,"Ahhh, makes sense."

09-03-2019T17:19:57,Bgrmystr2,should be easy to just add up all 4 polls for a few streams and get a decent average

09-03-2019T17:21:59,Katfeathers,Zen x Kat would save Kat from the utter sister zoning she got from Eric
09-03-2019T17:22:01,MuonNeutrino,"@Delphon if you're referring to which ones getinto the polls to start with, it's the ones suggested by patrons on his patreon page. if you're asking whichones *win*, the community votes"

09-03-2019T17:23:53,MuonNeutrino,"@Delphon the only time a patron suggestion doesnt get in is if that person is on cooldown from winning a vote the previous week or if tom vetoes their suggestion (too lewd, spoiler, etc)"
09-03-2019T17:24:06,Bgrmystr2,prettymuch what Muon said
09-03-2019T17:24:11,Delphon,Gotxha

09-03-2019T17:25:09,Delphon,Gotcha. Sorry if you didn't sign up for 20 questions
09-03-2019T17:25:20,Bgrmystr2,no it's fine

09-03-2019T17:26:12,Bgrmystr2,"Never do, usually."
09-03-2019T17:26:21,Ordithus,"Often the 2nd place vote, sometimes one that has been up for a while, or just what he wants to draw :P"
09-03-2019T17:26:27,Bgrmystr2,t'is why they're tom picks.
09-03-2019T17:26:28,Mippy,Whatever The Tom desires The Tom pickith

09-03-2019T17:26:56,Delphon,Personally I'm interested in seeing more about the mystery child. Not necessarily spoilers. More like Trace fussing over Flora when she tries to do things she shouldn't be or something like that.
09-03-2019T17:27:05,FloofyCat,And the most of the oil is soaked up and doesn't end up all over your pizza
09-03-2019T17:27:22,ThingsAreMoving,I like my pepperoni chewy
09-03-2019T17:27:38,CrRAR,:9
09-03-2019T17:27:49,Mippy,But grease is goodness
09-03-2019T17:27:53,FloofyCat,"It kinda depends on what you buy tbh, some pepperoni cooks too fast and will cook faster than the dough."

09-03-2019T17:28:40,ZephyrTWolffox,^never had em
09-03-2019T17:29:00,ThingsAreMoving,That's why I layer the pizza like this: dough -> cheese -> dry toppings -> wet toppings -> sauce
09-03-2019T17:29:10,Ordithus,Anchovies taste like oil and salt
09-03-2019T17:29:17,FJfox,MAGIC!

09-03-2019T20:59:51,RimaDraws,this is the first job ive made 12.77 a hour
09-03-2019T21:00:08,RimaDraws,full timers start at 22.07 for janitor and $26 for working on the line
09-03-2019T21:07:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,That feeling when you get pinched by 3 squads in Apex.... Fun times
09-03-2019T21:09:00,MviluUatusun,"Well, I guess I missed the end of the stream.  I got too busy doing other things and I missed most of it.  Maybe next week I'll be less busy and I can watch.  See y'all later."
09-03-2019T21:09:14,Ordithus,see ya mvilu
09-03-2019T21:09:21,MarvTheHugPharaoh,See ya mvilu

09-03-2019T21:13:27,Dadrobit,Apex sounds fun. Might hop on for a game or 12.
09-03-2019T21:13:44,Dadrobit,Also considering some LoL...
09-03-2019T21:13:54,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Got a slot open if you want
09-03-2019T21:14:09,Dadrobit,On PC tho
09-03-2019T21:14:19,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Yee
09-03-2019T21:14:24,Dadrobit,Reeeee*
09-03-2019T21:14:30,MarvTheHugPharaoh,;-;
09-03-2019T21:14:36,Dadrobit,Indeed.
09-03-2019T21:14:44,Dadrobit,I'm giga turbo shit on PC
09-03-2019T21:14:54,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Same
09-03-2019T21:15:17,Dadrobit,And I have yet to win a game with Caustic on PS4 too which is a super feelsbadman
09-03-2019T21:23:48,Bgrmystr2,"if controller is your preferred character control, just hook up a controller to the pc"
09-03-2019T21:23:51,Bgrmystr2,what's the issue?
09-03-2019T21:24:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Walking and reading I read “I’m gonna turbo shit” and I just
09-03-2019T21:24:32,Bgrmystr2,lol kiwi's tmi face..
09-03-2019T21:24:37,Bgrmystr2,and we can't see it through the chat
09-03-2019T21:26:38,Dadrobit,Because Dualshock 4 vs adept KBM players is actually soft inting.
09-03-2019T21:28:49,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Yee that would be insta death
09-03-2019T21:41:27,Bgrmystr2,inting..?
09-03-2019T21:41:34,Bgrmystr2,dunno the term
09-03-2019T21:42:29,Bgrmystr2,"and yeah I know controller is not as adaptable as keyboard+Mouse, but if you're better at the controller, you'll probably want to use that while practicing just the mecahnics of the keyboard+mouse"
09-03-2019T21:42:45,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"""Intentionally feeding or abbreviated as ""inting"" is the act of intentionally putting yourself or group of teammates behind by allowing yourself to be killed in doing something incredibly stupid or simply out of anger"""
09-03-2019T21:43:37,Bgrmystr2,"I would not agree it would be fully that, since if you're better at controller than keyboard+mouse, then using the latter would be inting."
09-03-2019T21:44:14,Bgrmystr2,it's just a matter of using what you're best at and practicing with the alternate until you're better with the new setup than the old one.
09-03-2019T21:44:23,Bgrmystr2,That's what I had to do for lots of games
09-03-2019T21:45:24,Bgrmystr2,"mouse+keyboard transferrs through most FPS games on the pc, though the rest of the buttons are usually different"
09-03-2019T21:45:57,Bgrmystr2,so there's lots of games out there you can play with just to get used to the setup without having to beat your face against a brick wall in Apex
09-03-2019T21:46:52,Bgrmystr2,"I can prettymuch go from controller to keyboard+mouse and back when I play Halo, whether on xbox or pc"
09-03-2019T21:46:59,Bgrmystr2,it's just practice :u
09-03-2019T21:52:45,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I have stopped playing apex so I can watch Dante from dmc 5 dance to different songs
09-03-2019T22:22:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Get home. Get food. Open box of food. Bagheera: “hi there”
09-03-2019T22:44:10,RimaDraws,castlevania is funny

09-03-2019T23:41:29,Dadrobit,Heading to bed myself
