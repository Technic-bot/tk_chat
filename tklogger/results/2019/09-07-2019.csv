09-07-2019T05:50:35,AspiringNoodle,Good news for Bgr
09-07-2019T05:50:44,AspiringNoodle,Apparently all the 3600/x cpus are available xD
09-07-2019T05:50:58,AspiringNoodle,Nobody wants that amazing $220/$250 6-core :(
09-07-2019T05:58:00,Bgrmystr2,xD
09-07-2019T05:58:34,Bgrmystr2,unrelated bad news for me
09-07-2019T05:58:41,AspiringNoodle,Oh no
09-07-2019T05:58:58,Bgrmystr2,there's a disturbance in the gulf going just south me so we're on the north side of it
09-07-2019T05:59:06,Bgrmystr2,it's goin from florida to texas
09-07-2019T05:59:24,Bgrmystr2,"and we're just north and will be getting heavy rain, probably flash flood warnings out the ass."
09-07-2019T05:59:41,Bgrmystr2,"tornados maybe, losing power or perhaps the internet."
09-07-2019T05:59:49,Bgrmystr2,gonna be a clutch couple of days
09-07-2019T06:00:01,AspiringNoodle,"Well... have fun with that, lol"
09-07-2019T06:00:35,Bgrmystr2,90% chance of forming a cyclone in 48 hrs. woo~
09-07-2019T06:00:51,AspiringNoodle,I experienced a tropical storm once
09-07-2019T06:00:55,AspiringNoodle,Loved it -w-
09-07-2019T06:01:21,Bgrmystr2,yeah well a storm lover like you probably would
09-07-2019T06:01:42,Bgrmystr2,though you'd change quick if you go through something like Katrina or Rita or whatnot :P
09-07-2019T06:15:04,AspiringNoodle,"Plug in the relevant RAM info, and you more or less have a number to tie to performance."
09-07-2019T06:16:12,Dadrobit,Just have to worry about flash floods during monsoon season out here.
09-07-2019T06:17:08,Dadrobit,"Just boils down to ""don't be stupid and try to take your tiny could through an overflowing wash."""
09-07-2019T06:17:18,Dadrobit,Tiny coupe*
09-07-2019T06:17:58,Bgrmystr2,lolo
09-07-2019T06:18:22,Dadrobit,"Having a ""stupid motorist law"" infraction on your record probably doesn't look all that great."
09-07-2019T06:18:54,Dadrobit,"I believe that's the name, or something close to it."
09-07-2019T06:20:23,Dadrobit,"Also, yes, it's cool to see that AMD is largely living up to the hype of its recent launches. This upcoming Black Friday might be my excuse for a new rig build. :D"
09-07-2019T06:21:12,Bgrmystr2,absolutely.
09-07-2019T06:22:03,Bgrmystr2,Newegg does a whole week for black friday and special deals specifically for cyber monday
09-07-2019T06:22:09,Dadrobit,Fx8350 to a 3600 or 3700 is gonna be a gnarly jump.
09-07-2019T06:22:11,Bgrmystr2,so it's cool to watch those sales be good
09-07-2019T06:22:35,Bgrmystr2,pff if I got a 3600.. now that would be something to behold
09-07-2019T06:22:42,Dadrobit,Dunno what to do about a GPU.
09-07-2019T06:22:44,Bgrmystr2,since I've still got 4core 4thread
09-07-2019T06:26:44,AspiringNoodle,"I also have a 4c/4t, but I'm using a 3570k :p"
09-07-2019T06:27:15,AspiringNoodle,"That said, can't overclock it too hard because of my cooler ^^;"
09-07-2019T06:27:30,Bgrmystr2,lol your cpu would probably flatten mine
09-07-2019T06:27:46,AspiringNoodle,"Kinda, it's showing its age in gaming."
09-07-2019T06:27:54,AspiringNoodle,Some games are pushing the cores preeeeeeeeetty high
09-07-2019T06:28:23,AspiringNoodle,"Back before the CPU usage bug in Rainbow Six Siege showed up, I was getting 80% util on all cores."
09-07-2019T06:28:31,Bgrmystr2,almost double the performance of mine on Passmark
09-07-2019T06:28:32,Bgrmystr2,so yeah
09-07-2019T06:29:28,Dadrobit,"8350 is marketed as an ""8 core"" CPU, but it's actually a 4c/8t and the threads aren't particularly efficient. I believe there's still a class action lawsuit still going on about them."
09-07-2019T06:29:47,AspiringNoodle,"Well, technically, it is an ""8-core"""
09-07-2019T06:30:02,AspiringNoodle,"It's just that it has 8 small cores with shared memory, but they aren't very efficient"
09-07-2019T06:30:19,AspiringNoodle,Assuming I'm thinking of the right SKUs
09-07-2019T06:30:42,AspiringNoodle,"AMD's philosphy hasn't changed too much, lol.  More cores now, single thread later ;P"
09-07-2019T06:31:04,Bgrmystr2,"honestly, I think it's the opposite now with Ryzen 3000"
09-07-2019T06:31:07,Dadrobit,"Yeah, it's got some blurry lines in there. 8 cores if you squint your eyes kinda deal."
09-07-2019T06:31:18,Bgrmystr2,because they said they worked particularly hard on getting single thread performance up
09-07-2019T06:31:36,AspiringNoodle,"Yeah, but they're still trying to push out the ""more cores is better"" marketing harder than ever"
09-07-2019T06:31:46,AspiringNoodle,And it's working!  Only took getting that ST performance up :D
09-07-2019T06:31:58,Bgrmystr2,"Yeah, but they already had multi-core improvements, but the single-thread performance is what was surprising"
09-07-2019T06:32:02,Bgrmystr2,the multi-core wasn't surprising
09-07-2019T06:32:11,Dadrobit,Single core performance is trash on mine lol. The multithread scores are still okay though.
09-07-2019T06:32:59,AspiringNoodle,I'm just bummed because it's Zen 1 all over again right now
09-07-2019T06:33:11,Dadrobit,Glad that they got single core up finally. My CPU is actually tragic when trying to compute off a single core.
09-07-2019T06:33:14,AspiringNoodle,People bought up EVERYTHING without even waiting for reviews
09-07-2019T06:34:05,Bgrmystr2,the fact that Ryzen 3000 prettymuch lives up to the hype bar a few percentage is really impressive imo
09-07-2019T06:34:19,AspiringNoodle,Pricing / availability is out the window
09-07-2019T06:34:39,Bgrmystr2,"yeah availability is a problem right now, but this was a given"
09-07-2019T06:34:49,AspiringNoodle,"If the thing you want IS available, there's a good chance that it's being sold by a third party for a steep price increase"
09-07-2019T06:34:57,Dadrobit,"Yeah, even as someone who uses AMD, I was super tentative on my hype, but it's cool to see them deliver."
09-07-2019T06:34:59,AspiringNoodle,This goes for MOBOs and RAM
09-07-2019T06:35:48,Bgrmystr2,there's no way they could ship as many as people wanted because there was no way for them to predict how many people would go to each individual store. I can only assume that pages like Amazon and Newegg severely underestimated how many they needed.
09-07-2019T06:36:52,AspiringNoodle,"Newegg, definitely"
09-07-2019T06:37:04,AspiringNoodle,"Amazon, eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh.  Last I checked they only had a listing for the 3700x"
09-07-2019T06:37:09,Bgrmystr2,amazon was out of stock across the board from what I heard.
09-07-2019T06:37:34,Bgrmystr2,they had a listing for all of them when I talked to a friend of mine not too long after I had woken up on the 7th
09-07-2019T06:40:01,AspiringNoodle,"I've been thinking, I'll probably end up getting a 2070 super or a 2080 when the price is cut"
09-07-2019T06:41:07,Bgrmystr2,I'm hoping to get an upgrade later this year
09-07-2019T06:41:20,AspiringNoodle,The extra money that will be going towards RAM / MOBO is one reason.  The other is the 2080 super will probably sell out immediately :/
09-07-2019T06:42:02,AspiringNoodle,"Man, it's so hard... being this close to building a new computer, but not being able to do so :c"
09-07-2019T06:42:18,Dadrobit,Was looking at a 2060 Super. Only use 1440p and it look like that would future proof me for a good long while. Maaaaaaaybe a 2070 super if I come across a ridiculous deal on Black Friday or something.
09-07-2019T06:43:59,AspiringNoodle,I'm going 2080 super just because I am going to start playing super demanding games on PC
09-07-2019T06:44:19,AspiringNoodle,And that should be more than enough to last 1440p for 5 years :3
09-07-2019T06:44:45,AspiringNoodle,Or not :P
09-07-2019T06:44:59,AspiringNoodle,"As processing power goes up, so does graphical demand to balance it out."
09-07-2019T06:45:45,Dadrobit,"Was looking at 2060 benchmarks and 1440p max settings were well beyond just ""playable""."
09-07-2019T06:46:58,Dadrobit,And I'm not one to why away from dropping a slider to get more frames over time.
09-07-2019T06:47:06,Dadrobit,Shy away*
09-07-2019T06:48:38,AspiringNoodle,"I'm working under the assumption that if I get the 2080 super, it'll go maybe 2 years at most before I start dropping graphics settings to maintain at least 60 fps"
09-07-2019T06:49:47,Dadrobit,"4k maybe, but I don't much care for that."
09-07-2019T06:50:04,AspiringNoodle,I'm also using a 144hz monitor ;)
09-07-2019T06:50:21,AspiringNoodle,"So every frame over 60 is a bonus (50, even)"
09-07-2019T06:51:23,Dadrobit,Too much damned money.
09-07-2019T06:51:37,AspiringNoodle,Agreed
09-07-2019T06:51:44,AspiringNoodle,But I was a dummy and got a 1440p 144hz monitor :p
09-07-2019T06:52:27,AspiringNoodle,"That said, 4k is still a bit of a ways off from being mainstream"
09-07-2019T06:52:50,AspiringNoodle,"Minimum 80 series, ideally 80 ti and up, or 80 in SLI."
09-07-2019T06:53:13,Dadrobit,"Mmmmmm, can't wait for some decent 4k capable consoles to come out."
09-07-2019T06:53:32,AspiringNoodle,They might hit actual 4k next gen
09-07-2019T06:53:45,AspiringNoodle,"That said, they're consoles, so the eye candy will be dialed back compared to what PC can pull ;)"
09-07-2019T06:54:25,Dadrobit,Next gen has me excited regardless of whether it can or not. Supposedly PS5 performance is beating out GTX 1080 performance.
09-07-2019T06:54:55,AspiringNoodle,"When I heard about that, my first that, ""Well, there's another checkmark to support the rumored $800 price tag"""
09-07-2019T06:54:59,AspiringNoodle,thought*
09-07-2019T06:55:00,Dadrobit,And the 1080 is still a heckuva card to begin with.
09-07-2019T06:55:38,AspiringNoodle,"But I find it funny they say 1080, and not 2070"
09-07-2019T06:55:46,AspiringNoodle,Because the 2070 is roughly the same in terms of raster ;)
09-07-2019T06:56:25,Dadrobit,"I don't think it will, I'd be shocked to see above $699. Even if they have to take a loss, I can't see them going that high."
09-07-2019T06:56:46,AspiringNoodle,*inb4 costs $1000*
09-07-2019T06:56:51,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-snicker:
09-07-2019T06:56:56,Dadrobit,PS3 hopefully taught them their lesson...
09-07-2019T06:58:37,Dadrobit,"PS4 is only $299, to introduce the next gen at much more than 2x the cost while the PS4 still looks as good as it does, it would be a kind bogglingly bad idea."
09-07-2019T06:58:49,Dadrobit,Mind*
09-07-2019T06:59:12,AspiringNoodle,There's only so much mass production can do to cut prices for consumers
09-07-2019T06:59:33,AspiringNoodle,"Custom SSD (supposedly better performing than anything on the market), custom mobo, cooling, CPU, GPU, RAM"
09-07-2019T07:00:05,AspiringNoodle,And they're talking about matching mid-to-high-end PC components in performance?
09-07-2019T07:00:19,Dadrobit,That's where software sales make the diff. They've taken losses on hardware before. I believe the PS4 has been it's whole life as well.
09-07-2019T07:00:59,AspiringNoodle,That's a rather risky gambit to keep employing each generation
09-07-2019T07:01:13,AspiringNoodle,Especially since Sony is under fire for controversial censorship policies
09-07-2019T07:03:17,Bgrmystr2,"Alright, it's too late, I'm off to bed. Here's to hoping we don't lose power or internet overnight."
09-07-2019T07:03:39,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-sleepy: gnight guys beep boop :robot:
09-07-2019T07:04:19,Dadrobit,That controversy is a drop in a lake of Sony's mindshare tbh.
09-07-2019T07:04:24,AspiringNoodle,:tea:
09-07-2019T07:04:54,AspiringNoodle,"Yeah, just wait until it starts affecting more and more games"
09-07-2019T07:05:01,AspiringNoodle,It hit DMC5 :/
09-07-2019T07:05:12,AspiringNoodle,It might hit Cyberpunk
09-07-2019T07:05:28,Dadrobit,"Sure, it's annoying to anyone who knows/cares, but I'd be willing to bet that the overwhelming majority are more peeved about things like not doing cross play between platforms."
09-07-2019T07:06:08,Dadrobit,o/ bgr
09-07-2019T07:08:03,AspiringNoodle,"That said, if they pull it off, I'm game >:3"
09-07-2019T07:08:17,AspiringNoodle,"After all, they'll still have exclusives"
09-07-2019T07:08:30,AspiringNoodle,And I think I'd like to play them at some nice visual fidelity :p
09-07-2019T07:10:44,Dadrobit,Brother has PSVR and even on his basic PS4 that shit is mind-blowing. I'm really hoping that PS5 introduces a next gen PSVR. I won't leave the house.
09-07-2019T07:15:28,Dadrobit,"Anywho, time for me to fill out some final reports and clock out for the day. Have a good one y'all."
09-07-2019T07:19:47,AspiringNoodle,I stand corrected about earlier... apparently the 2080's ARE getting price cuts for some manufacturers
09-07-2019T07:21:06,AspiringNoodle,"MSI's Ventus OC (black/white 2-fan) is normally $770, price cut to $740, rebate card available to knock it down to $720, and then there's a promo code on top of ALL that to drop it another $90 to $630"

09-07-2019T18:37:05,AspiringNoodle,Do you have him take the right track and kill a lady scientist who will someday cure cancer? (+10 cards to everyone's game if they choose her)

09-07-2019T20:35:39,IronHorseComics,"ya know, I had a thought, how would a world of furries describe a human to one another?"
09-07-2019T20:36:07,IronHorseComics,like say if someone saw a human walking around and went to tell his buddies about it
09-07-2019T20:38:19,Mippy,Shaved apes?
09-07-2019T20:39:25,IronHorseComics,"eeeehhhhh maybe as a start, but what if they wanted to get REALLY descriptive"
09-07-2019T20:39:49,IronHorseComics,I suppose they would say they have a mane for one

09-07-2019T21:22:35,AspiringNoodle,Rhea had the most glorious melons you ever laid eyes on :ptv-ohmy:
09-07-2019T21:22:49,Sclimshady,Watermelons are pretty great
09-07-2019T21:24:58,SpazztasticKiwi,🍉
09-07-2019T21:25:33,Sclimshady,^^
09-07-2019T21:25:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I got ice cream
09-07-2019T21:25:57,Sclimshady,Are you gonna share?
09-07-2019T21:26:08,SpazztasticKiwi,get yer own
09-07-2019T21:26:19,Sclimshady,:ctwokinds-maevecute:
09-07-2019T21:26:31,SpazztasticKiwi,ok I’ll share with the baby
09-07-2019T21:26:32,Sclimshady,:icecream:
09-07-2019T21:26:45,SpazztasticKiwi,but you on your own
09-07-2019T21:27:34,SpazztasticKiwi,also I’m pretty sure I interrupted this guy watching you know what on his phone in the parking lot
09-07-2019T21:28:30,Sclimshady,Oh no :ctwokinds-clovisgirl_shake:
09-07-2019T21:28:40,CrRAR,ew
09-07-2019T21:28:46,SpazztasticKiwi,at first it just looked like he was hunched over the steering wheel asleep
09-07-2019T21:29:16,IronHorseComics,*facepalm*
09-07-2019T21:29:34,SpazztasticKiwi,but my well meaning lil heart wanted to check if he was ok so I tapped the window and he hid his phone
09-07-2019T21:29:51,SpazztasticKiwi,I didn’t look further nor did I care to
09-07-2019T21:30:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I told a manager he may need to be checked on when I went back in and left it alone
09-07-2019T21:31:30,SpazztasticKiwi,oddly enough this is why they shortened the wifi range for the store. They’ve caught people using it for such things before
09-07-2019T21:31:46,IronHorseComics,*facepalms harder*
09-07-2019T21:32:45,SpazztasticKiwi,one man was arrested even

09-07-2019T21:38:17,CrRAR,You sure you don't work for THIS place spazz?
09-07-2019T21:38:21,CrRAR,https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/rockosmodernlife/images/d/dc/Chokey_Chicken.png
09-07-2019T21:38:53,CrRAR,Could explain SO much. xD
09-07-2019T21:41:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I work for Walmart
09-07-2019T21:42:06,IronHorseComics,oh that explains it even more
09-07-2019T21:42:14,SpazztasticKiwi,does it “man caught jacking in the parking lot” really sound that out of place for that
09-07-2019T21:42:14,Sclimshady,That also explains so much
09-07-2019T21:43:49,IronHorseComics,"I don't remember if my walmarts wifi were password locked, but I do know the vast majority of fast food resturants have signed a deal with the most evil cable company in the world (Comcast) and you have to have a Comcast account to access the wi-fi"
09-07-2019T21:44:10,SpazztasticKiwi,here you just link up
09-07-2019T21:44:44,IronHorseComics,it's really annoying and I have to turn the wi-fi off on my phone and use the LTE to avoid the popups that refuse to go away
09-07-2019T21:45:02,SpazztasticKiwi,there’s a “this wifi could access the websites you visit - protect your privacy” thing
09-07-2019T21:45:37,SpazztasticKiwi,a warning against “special” sites I’m sure but also for those doing online shopping and credit card or whatever information
09-07-2019T21:45:59,Mippy,:ctwokinds-nibspartyhard: Happy I can do this now

09-07-2019T22:02:31,Mippy,I gotta look at the switch library and see if it would be worth the purchace for me
09-07-2019T22:08:07,SpazztasticKiwi,for a second I was thinking you were just commenting on expensive bras
09-07-2019T22:08:20,SpazztasticKiwi,in which I feel
09-07-2019T22:09:50,Mippy,Dude! I resently baught bras and got a great deal! They had a buy one..get one thing going on. That is great for plus size bras. There is your bra comment

09-07-2019T22:11:41,Mippy,That's a steal.
09-07-2019T22:12:10,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s the advantage of lil boobies
09-07-2019T22:13:11,Mippy,*Mippy wishes for smaller bobs*
09-07-2019T22:14:22,SpazztasticKiwi,if we could I’d take some boob of ya hands
09-07-2019T22:14:46,SpazztasticKiwi,lil boobs ain’t too much to crack off about
09-07-2019T22:16:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I shit you not I once had a little boy ask “mommy is that a boy or a girl” in a supermarket
09-07-2019T22:16:33,SpazztasticKiwi,loudly

09-07-2019T22:22:24,SpazztasticKiwi,if there’s ever a time to be close to tears..
09-07-2019T22:22:24,Mippy,Why is Flora on vibreate?
09-07-2019T22:23:00,Bgrmystr2,Flora's always set on vibrate. :V
09-07-2019T22:23:02,Ordithus,The topic of conversation is highly relevant to Flora's vibrations

09-07-2019T22:26:45,SpazztasticKiwi,he was parked next to me
09-07-2019T22:26:46,Dadrobit,A guard was shot and killed a few years back after going up to a guy just sitting in his car in a parking lot.
09-07-2019T22:26:59,Dadrobit,Before shooting himself.
09-07-2019T22:27:00,SpazztasticKiwi,had no choice in the matter
09-07-2019T22:27:45,Mippy,Dang
09-07-2019T22:27:57,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m just happy I didn’t see anything cause I’m pretty sure I’d be gay now
09-07-2019T22:29:57,SpazztasticKiwi,got no issues with people and their sexy moments but there’s a time and place and Walmart parking lot is not one of em
09-07-2019T22:31:01,Ordithus,"Ok, yikes.  I got here late.  Sounds like you had a bad day at work."
09-07-2019T22:32:57,SpazztasticKiwi,"maybe. parked next to a guy slumped over his steering wheel. tapped the window after mentioning it to my manager, thinking he’s passed out or somethin"
09-07-2019T22:33:31,SpazztasticKiwi,dude hides his phone real quick and my brain decided not to look any harder lest I see something to fuel nightmares
09-07-2019T22:34:41,Ordithus,"yeeah, I gathered about as much.  WTF"
09-07-2019T22:46:48,SpazztasticKiwi,sadly it’s the reason they and McDonald’s has shortened the wifi range
09-07-2019T22:47:44,SpazztasticKiwi,granted they have firewalls against keywords or whatever blocking websites like that but apparently just the common or obvious ones
09-07-2019T22:48:35,SpazztasticKiwi,but much like the library wifi there’s holes
