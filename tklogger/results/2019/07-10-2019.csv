07-10-2019T00:41:07,AspiringNoodle,"At that point, my response would be, ""Okay, later and fuck you too!"""
07-10-2019T00:41:27,AspiringNoodle,It would be pretty funny if 75%+ of their staff just up and quit

07-10-2019T10:35:32,AspiringNoodle,"Will need to keep an eye on the week after that, though.  Need to make sure that I didn't get that many hours only because of availability"

07-10-2019T11:09:13,AspiringNoodle,"Reni's face says ""You don't have to be so mean about it..."""
07-10-2019T11:09:41,AspiringNoodle,"Also, please be irreversible, please be irreversible, please be irreversible xD"
07-10-2019T16:27:40,Xexanoth,"all the fluff, for once i actually had a good idea when i threw that lion option in chat :ptv-excited: (Yay i did a good)"
07-10-2019T17:30:27,TerraTheWizard,"hey tom, was going through an archive of twokinds images and saw a few things of characters with golfclubs"
07-10-2019T17:30:34,TerraTheWizard,do you remember what those were for?
07-10-2019T17:37:33,Twokinds,"Golfclubs are used to play golf with. They hit the ball, and the ball goes into a hole in the ground some distance away."
07-10-2019T17:38:02,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-keith8D:
07-10-2019T17:38:42,IronHorseComics,they require skill but 0 athleticism

07-10-2019T17:39:10,IronHorseComics,thus disqualifying golf as a sport
07-10-2019T17:39:46,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
07-10-2019T17:56:43,Twokinds,The real reason is because in 2009 I went to what was technically my first comic convention.
07-10-2019T17:57:15,Twokinds,"And the theme of the year was golf. They paid my way, and just asked me to draw my characters holding golf clubs."
07-10-2019T17:57:23,Twokinds,Thus... very random art. XD
07-10-2019T17:58:09,TerraTheWizard,ahh

07-10-2019T19:48:48,IronHorseComics,a $500 clarinet?

07-10-2019T19:49:51,SpazztasticKiwi,it looks like a toot toot of some sort but I don’t know what pitch
07-10-2019T19:50:17,IronHorseComics,"again, clarinet"
07-10-2019T19:50:43,IronHorseComics,"it's kind of a mid range between a flute and a tuba, a bit closer to the flute"
07-10-2019T19:51:05,SpazztasticKiwi,squidward gave up then
07-10-2019T19:51:31,IronHorseComics,took him long enough

07-10-2019T20:44:39,SpazztasticKiwi,the other day before I left work some 6+ish foot guy went through produce making race car noises behind what I guessed to his mom
07-10-2019T20:45:10,SpazztasticKiwi,who was disregarding him as well as she could
