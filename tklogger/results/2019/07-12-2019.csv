07-12-2019T14:56:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"fun filler idea: Kat runs into Flora on her way to the kitchen and compliments her, saying she’s glowing"
07-12-2019T14:56:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Flora tells her it’s just sweat
07-12-2019T14:56:49,TerraTheWizard,ew

07-12-2019T14:58:29,tehbear,do tigers even sweat?
07-12-2019T14:59:19,SpazztasticKiwi,cats and dogs - dogs I know at least sweat through their paws and panting - don’t sweat “traditionally”
07-12-2019T14:59:38,SpazztasticKiwi,cats...can pant but it means they’re overheating
07-12-2019T14:59:42,IronHorseComics,"ah a page with a whole lotta characters, I feel your pain bro"
07-12-2019T15:00:57,SpazztasticKiwi,"and according to google, cats sweat through their paws too"
07-12-2019T15:01:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"if you go to a zoo, or notice in the wild, plenty of big cats soak in water"
07-12-2019T15:01:42,tehbear,watercooled cats
07-12-2019T15:02:00,TeapotOfDoom,can you overclock them too?

07-12-2019T15:02:51,TeapotOfDoom,oh shit
07-12-2019T15:02:53,TeapotOfDoom,bad idea
07-12-2019T15:03:48,tehbear,"i never seen a panting cat, but dogs pant all the time"
07-12-2019T15:04:20,tehbear,"i guess their smaller bodies have less heat capacity, and they move more efficiently, so they dont need to?"
07-12-2019T15:04:58,PalmettoPathfinder1,I wonder if Trace and Flora's baby will be as cute as Baby Yoda!
07-12-2019T15:05:28,TeapotOfDoom,*insert baby yoda being pleasantly surprised*
07-12-2019T15:05:59,PalmettoPathfinder1,*insert gleeful joyous cheering over baby Yoda and baby Flora&Trace's baby*
07-12-2019T15:06:26,TeapotOfDoom,less volume means more surface in comparison to volume so more heat dissipated?
07-12-2019T15:06:55,TeapotOfDoom,we already know it has tail
07-12-2019T15:07:30,TeapotOfDoom,we'll see but I'm pretty positive on it being mindboglingly cute

07-12-2019T15:56:33,PalmettoPathfinder1,@TwoKinds did my suggestion get in alright? My internet was acting up when I sent it in.
07-12-2019T15:57:41,BadFoMo,@Twokinds ...Same question; but the form was acting a little weird.
07-12-2019T15:58:19,PalmettoPathfinder1,Ah so it wasn't just me.  The form was acting up a bit now that I think about it.
07-12-2019T15:58:24,tehbear,bad form
07-12-2019T15:58:30,AspiringNoodle,very bad form
07-12-2019T15:58:34,MarvTheHugPharaoh,You can probably check by re-entering the form.  If it says you already submitted you should be golden.
07-12-2019T15:58:48,BadFoMo,Thanks.
07-12-2019T15:58:52,PalmettoPathfinder1,Same here.
07-12-2019T15:58:54,PalmettoPathfinder1,Checks.
07-12-2019T15:59:04,Avolendi,That sounds inert
07-12-2019T15:59:52,PalmettoPathfinder1,Yep.  It says that you are editing a form you already sent in.  So I'm good.

07-12-2019T16:26:16,ThingsAreMoving,Imagine Tom was nervous about showing her human form. Maybe with this confidence boost we'll see more daring reveals?

07-12-2019T17:35:49,ThingsAreMoving,or just get the OST and play it in your headphones
07-12-2019T17:36:26,ThingsAreMoving,"Palmetto, this one: https://www.patreon.com/posts/exploring-tiger-28633401 ?"

07-12-2019T19:08:48,Xexanoth,@ThefreindlyDeathclaw it's a bit close to the turkey roleplaying idea we just had
07-12-2019T19:08:52,SpazztasticKiwi,the cat creatures from that live action movie are gonna come for teddy
07-12-2019T19:09:02,tehbear,Sonic?

07-12-2019T19:09:17,ThingsAreMoving,That horrifying musical?
07-12-2019T19:09:23,SpazztasticKiwi,yep
07-12-2019T19:09:29,SpazztasticKiwi,he’s calling him

07-12-2019T19:09:39,ThingsAreMoving,the cringe is strong with that one
07-12-2019T19:09:54,SpazztasticKiwi,I saw the trailer before frozen 2
07-12-2019T19:10:03,SpazztasticKiwi,so many drugs were involved
07-12-2019T19:10:03,TeapotOfDoom,accurate representation of furries
07-12-2019T19:10:19,tehbear,whats the title?
07-12-2019T19:10:32,TeapotOfDoom,./s
07-12-2019T19:10:36,tehbear,cats the musical?
07-12-2019T19:10:36,ThingsAreMoving,'Cats'
07-12-2019T19:10:43,SpazztasticKiwi,for a second it looked like Red just straight up had his face under Raines Christmas dress
07-12-2019T19:10:55,TeapotOfDoom,red lifts raine to decorate the tree but her tail gets in his sight

07-12-2019T19:11:22,falangie123,isn't it weird how anthro stuff/talking animals is solidly in the mainstream yet actual furry stuff is seen as 'weird'?
07-12-2019T19:11:42,tehbear,its on the tipping point
07-12-2019T19:11:51,ThingsAreMoving,cause the vocal minority of furries makes bad name for the rest of them
07-12-2019T19:11:58,TeapotOfDoom,curious which way it's gonna tip tho
07-12-2019T19:11:58,w0lfmare,^
07-12-2019T19:11:59,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah its the communities fault
07-12-2019T19:12:02,falangie123,"like the cats musical, zootopia etc"
07-12-2019T19:12:08,unsteddyphoenix,especially back in the day
07-12-2019T19:12:12,TeapotOfDoom,yup
07-12-2019T19:12:31,w0lfmare,Most people don't think looney tunes or zootopia as the primary example of furry stuff
07-12-2019T19:12:33,TeapotOfDoom,just watch the internet historian video on the tony the tiger desaster
07-12-2019T19:12:43,Katfeathers,o/
07-12-2019T19:12:44,w0lfmare,Most think of furry lewds
07-12-2019T19:12:51,TeapotOfDoom,o/ kat
07-12-2019T19:13:13,ThingsAreMoving,o/ kat
07-12-2019T19:13:16,falangie123,i have no experience or knowledge of the furry community so that's interesting
07-12-2019T19:13:20,TeapotOfDoom,indeed w0lf
07-12-2019T19:13:29,NezumiYuki,spouts Mtn Dew out her nose.... Did somebody say Furry Lewds?  >:3
07-12-2019T19:13:36,TeapotOfDoom,no
07-12-2019T19:13:39,w0lfmare,"Which is pretty justified, considering what the community does to the characters as soon as a new furry movie comes out"
07-12-2019T19:13:41,TeapotOfDoom,i heard nothing
07-12-2019T19:13:57,TeapotOfDoom,r34 is strong with this one
07-12-2019T19:14:03,unsteddyphoenix,Haha
07-12-2019T19:14:05,KodaLegacy,Oof
07-12-2019T19:14:13,Xexanoth,which is no different than normal humans and non furry stuff
07-12-2019T19:14:14,ThingsAreMoving,"Yeah, the lewding is strong and swift in this community"
07-12-2019T19:14:15,unsteddyphoenix,"I think it was more, the furries attitudes rather than the lewds"
07-12-2019T19:14:22,falangie123,but i mean that happens in every fanbase of every movie
07-12-2019T19:14:22,AspiringNoodle,baps Nezumi with a newspaper
07-12-2019T19:14:23,Katfeathers,The lewd side is a vocal sub group

07-12-2019T19:15:58,TeapotOfDoom,yeah people being abnoctious about it is the biggest problem
07-12-2019T19:16:09,Katfeathers,Technically aye
07-12-2019T19:16:12,falangie123,lol and there's a new furry race in WoW too

07-12-2019T19:16:22,unsteddyphoenix,But I doubt it started with trolls. I think it just started with a bunch of socially inept nerds yelling about their subculture

07-12-2019T19:20:55,tehbear,huskies are supposed to wear harnesses for mushing
07-12-2019T19:21:00,w0lfmare,Harnesses aren't for lewd marv get your mind out of the gutter
07-12-2019T19:21:08,w0lfmare,She was a rescue husky

07-12-2019T19:21:47,AspiringNoodle,Clean yet teasy seems like a much larger audience and just as fun :ptv-uneasy:
07-12-2019T19:21:50,Avolendi,Just start with stick figures? ^^
07-12-2019T19:21:53,TheFreindlyDeathclaw,Fluff kevlar drew  Jenna in nothing but a harness and that was very leeeewd
07-12-2019T19:22:03,w0lfmare,Bikinis are for the beach

07-12-2019T19:22:24,NezumiYuki,Okay well since you guys seem so deadset against my looding of laura... I'll just go back to looding Nibbly because who can resist that fluffy tree rat tail of hers?  <3
07-12-2019T19:22:28,ThingsAreMoving,not practical though
