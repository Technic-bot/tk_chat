21-09-2019T18:42:08,AspiringNoodle,"There seems to be limits as to how fast you can make things move / happen, and I would advise upping your mouse sensitivity big time if you don't want to flail your arms everywhere"
21-09-2019T18:44:00,SamuelCuucu,ah i see
21-09-2019T18:44:18,SamuelCuucu,r u guys seeing my comments?

21-09-2019T19:04:03,AspiringNoodle,I think I'ma call that a night.  Multiple failures + multiple falls back to near starting areas
21-09-2019T19:04:38,AspiringNoodle,"An hour in and I'm at the staircase, not bad"
21-09-2019T19:05:05,SamuelCuucu,oh yeah. take as much time as you need to
21-09-2019T19:05:18,SamuelCuucu,its good to take breaks
21-09-2019T19:05:32,SamuelCuucu,relieve some of the stress
21-09-2019T19:05:54,AspiringNoodle,"What's funny is, I think markiplier had so much trouble because the game's controls seem to be designed to handicap stressed players"
21-09-2019T19:06:04,AspiringNoodle,They require you to be a bit more slow and controlled
21-09-2019T19:06:22,SamuelCuucu,XD yeah.
21-09-2019T19:06:33,SamuelCuucu,my exact reasons why i dont wanna play it
21-09-2019T21:29:19,Dadrobit,"Blah, my main chair just broke."

21-09-2019T21:34:07,Dadrobit,Seems an emergency visit to Office Depot is in order
21-09-2019T21:46:17,AspiringNoodle,I would love to buy a chair without a wood base
21-09-2019T21:46:29,AspiringNoodle,"Pipe dream, I know :c"
