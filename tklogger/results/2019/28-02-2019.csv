28-02-2019T14:06:39,Mippy,Just got a lot to do in a day? Maybe a vitamin deficiency?
28-02-2019T14:10:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Low potassium sodium and iron can be that bad
28-02-2019T14:10:15,SpazztasticKiwi,I speak from experience
28-02-2019T14:11:20,Mippy,I know all about low iron. :ptv-dealwithit:
28-02-2019T14:12:00,Mippy,It is more common in females though.
28-02-2019T14:32:43,CrRAR,..and Vampires. Some say their thirst for blood stems from a chronic iron deficiency.
28-02-2019T14:33:09,CrRAR,Tom have you considered the possibility you might be a vampire?

28-02-2019T21:02:02,Bgrmystr2,it almost always says that
28-02-2019T21:02:04,SageSaga,well - i found out something interesting last night while trying to go to sleep
28-02-2019T21:02:15,unsteddyphoenix,ohoh?
28-02-2019T21:02:20,CrRAR,:question:
28-02-2019T21:02:21,Bgrmystr2,"and heya sage, whatchu found out"
28-02-2019T21:02:39,BadFoMo,You can't sleep when you want too?
28-02-2019T21:02:42,SageSaga,the books are gonna be more expensive than my original estimates- and i gotta start a kickstarter within the next 2 weeks
28-02-2019T21:02:58,Combak,Hi Sage!
28-02-2019T21:02:58,Bgrmystr2,you should probably try a gofundme instead.
28-02-2019T21:03:13,Bgrmystr2,"if kickstarter fails, everyone gets refunds and you get nothing but time and effort wasted"
28-02-2019T21:03:33,Bgrmystr2,gofundme still gives you the money you raised (if it is that one that I recall)
28-02-2019T21:04:02,Combak,One of those leads to angry fans asking for their money back. You guess which onethat is.
28-02-2019T21:04:03,Bgrmystr2,pretty sure I'm remembering the right one though. I can't think of any other fundraiser sites off the top my head.
28-02-2019T21:04:17,Nekonny,o/
28-02-2019T21:04:22,CrRAR,\o

28-02-2019T21:04:32,MarvTheHugPharaoh,RON \o/
28-02-2019T21:04:33,SageSaga,but if i dont make the money i need then i cant do it

28-02-2019T21:04:49,Combak,"Also, wrong person FoMo."

28-02-2019T21:04:54,SageSaga,yo Ron
28-02-2019T21:04:56,unsteddyphoenix,hey ron
28-02-2019T21:05:11,SageSaga,probably print ninja but they need 8-10 weeks to do it

28-02-2019T21:05:55,SageSaga,they can do it in 4 weeks if i want to spend an extra 1000 dollars
28-02-2019T21:06:02,Nekonny,"but yeah, it's a time crunch"
28-02-2019T21:06:12,SageSaga,music is playing- one sec
28-02-2019T21:06:26,Nekonny,"if you need any help or have questions about kickstarters, you know a lot of people that have run them ^^"

28-02-2019T21:07:54,Nekonny,thats the amount I had done
28-02-2019T21:08:58,SageSaga,im hoping the kickstarter will sell around 285-300
28-02-2019T21:11:40,Nekonny,the math for a kickstarter can get complicated
28-02-2019T21:11:48,SageSaga,i need to raise about 8400
28-02-2019T21:11:51,Nekonny,theres a lot to account for
28-02-2019T21:12:20,Nekonny,you often end up neededng a lot more than you expected
28-02-2019T21:12:23,BadFoMo,8400 Yen?
28-02-2019T21:12:30,CrRAR,lol

28-02-2019T21:13:26,Nekonny,theres always extra expenses that we didn't forsee
28-02-2019T21:13:33,Nekonny,some people don't
28-02-2019T21:14:07,SageSaga,"I already applied tax, shipping, patreon fees, processing fees, is there something else?"
28-02-2019T21:14:10,Nekonny,your goal amount is about the same as mine was for my print ninja run
28-02-2019T21:14:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,RON!!!.  liking this pose

28-02-2019T22:44:17,Kameloh,hello! how is everyone today :D
28-02-2019T22:44:19,Ordithus,"Something about bouncy animations, Xe"
28-02-2019T22:44:28,NezumiYuki,"Doing good, how'R you?"
28-02-2019T22:44:32,Nekonny,yah

28-02-2019T22:44:49,Xexanoth,"oh, i guess"
28-02-2019T22:44:58,Twokinds,Hope you're feeling better
28-02-2019T22:44:58,Kameloh,just painting a dragon :eyes:
28-02-2019T22:45:04,Kameloh,hey Tom -- yeah sorry about yesterday!
28-02-2019T22:45:06,CrRAR,Ooo
28-02-2019T22:45:19,Xexanoth,it's a subjective preference so...
28-02-2019T22:45:20,BadFoMo,What happened?
28-02-2019T22:45:36,Kameloh,better now -- gonna paint some gold tonight
28-02-2019T22:45:37,FoxxTrotter,"E'lo, Kameloh."
28-02-2019T22:46:09,Twokinds,goldbold?
28-02-2019T22:46:12,Twokinds,XD
28-02-2019T22:46:16,NezumiYuki,"Nice Tiger Tush there, Ron!"
28-02-2019T22:46:17,Ordithus,Tina booty
28-02-2019T22:46:27,Kameloh,I loved the goldbold XD
28-02-2019T22:46:54,BadFoMo,@Nekonny ...That looks ...deranged.
28-02-2019T22:47:12,CrRAR,lol
28-02-2019T22:47:43,Kameloh,water dragon :dragon_face:
28-02-2019T22:48:21,Nekonny,deranged?
28-02-2019T22:48:35,NezumiYuki,SpidorDance!
28-02-2019T22:48:37,unsteddyphoenix,oh man
28-02-2019T22:48:38,Nekonny,"oh, the tiger? XD"
28-02-2019T22:48:39,unsteddyphoenix,thats amazing
28-02-2019T22:48:41,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Dragon booty
28-02-2019T22:48:49,Kameloh,background is turning out great Tom
28-02-2019T22:48:50,NezumiYuki,Mmmm Lady Nora
28-02-2019T22:48:57,Xexanoth,well that was new
28-02-2019T22:49:02,BadFoMo,The look in her eyes did it for me.
28-02-2019T22:49:03,Ordithus,Gorgeous
28-02-2019T22:49:14,unsteddyphoenix,Honestly I cant wait for that nora pic to come out
28-02-2019T22:49:28,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Them leaves brush :eyes:
28-02-2019T22:49:30,BadFoMo,...Maybe even the lack of a nose too.
28-02-2019T22:49:34,totallynotTrace,Hi guys
28-02-2019T22:49:38,CrRAR,Hi
28-02-2019T22:49:38,BadFoMo,Y.
28-02-2019T22:49:44,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Trace
28-02-2019T22:49:44,BadFoMo,*Yo.
28-02-2019T22:49:49,Ordithus,Hi notTrace
28-02-2019T22:50:43,totallynotTrace,cool to see Tom got the music tag stuff workin
28-02-2019T22:51:03,Kameloh,:ckameloh-naokithinky:
28-02-2019T22:53:37,BadFoMo,I know I cracked this joke near the start but; @totallynotTrace FireFox: Time for an update!
28-02-2019T22:55:06,NezumiYuki,I totally wasn't paying attention... What was today's Firefox update about again?
28-02-2019T22:55:30,totallynotTrace,"like, I understand that firefox like to do anoying updates (still less than windows 10) but i think i missed the punchline on that. Its part of the video stream not the player i am watching it on"
28-02-2019T22:55:51,NezumiYuki,HERP!
28-02-2019T22:55:54,NezumiYuki,sorry  xD
28-02-2019T22:55:58,totallynotTrace,yeah same boat as Nezumi.... what?
28-02-2019T22:56:53,NezumiYuki,"Uhhh on a relevant note~  How's that brush working for you, Tom?"
28-02-2019T22:57:17,totallynotTrace,I should have read what Nezumi said a bit more carefully
28-02-2019T22:57:34,InTheLionsDen,Firefox: Fixed an issue with geolocation services affecting Windows users
28-02-2019T22:57:44,totallynotTrace,but i still dont understand the joke
28-02-2019T22:57:46,totallynotTrace,oh
28-02-2019T22:57:47,totallynotTrace,k
28-02-2019T22:57:49,Twokinds,Good?
28-02-2019T22:57:58,NezumiYuki,"Ohhhhh!   okay thanks for the clear up, Lions"
28-02-2019T22:58:55,totallynotTrace,oh im guessing Tom uses Firefox and it broke in a update a while back?
28-02-2019T22:59:05,NezumiYuki,Oh?
28-02-2019T22:59:22,Kameloh,Tom do you have room for another stream :thinking:
28-02-2019T23:00:27,Combak,You're asking the wrong person.
28-02-2019T23:00:27,KiTA,Apparently Disney is shutting down Marvel Comics
28-02-2019T23:00:34,KiTA,they're going to outsource the comics to other companies
28-02-2019T23:00:35,Bgrmystr2,"prolly better to ask sage since he's the one that hosts the Friday multistreams, Kame"
28-02-2019T23:00:45,Kameloh,"ahh, I didn't know, sorry!"
28-02-2019T23:00:46,Combak,I REALLY doubt that KiTA.
28-02-2019T23:01:09,KiTA,I would be surprised but then again Marvel has had some pretty big problems
28-02-2019T23:01:29,BadFoMo,Micky = EA?
28-02-2019T23:01:48,NezumiYuki,FoMo~   It appears so nowadays anyway
28-02-2019T23:02:05,Mippy,Mippy is here with meatballs and burritoes
28-02-2019T23:02:14,NezumiYuki,Hi hi Mippy
28-02-2019T23:03:09,Combak,Hi Mippy.
28-02-2019T23:04:04,NezumiYuki,"Looking kickass there, Nekonny!"
28-02-2019T23:04:47,Nekonny,thanks nezumi ^^
28-02-2019T23:04:56,NezumiYuki,Most welcome!
28-02-2019T23:06:03,Nekonny,eyes keep closing
28-02-2019T23:06:08,Nekonny,so tired
28-02-2019T23:06:12,NezumiYuki,Awww!
28-02-2019T23:06:20,Mippy,cute Nekonny
28-02-2019T23:06:38,Nekonny,hum?
28-02-2019T23:06:54,Mippy,squil girl
28-02-2019T23:07:08,Nekonny,ah ^^ thanks ^^
28-02-2019T23:07:11,BadFoMo,@Nekonny ...I think I see a problem with the ax. I don't think they can balence like that.
28-02-2019T23:07:47,Mippy,*squirrel
28-02-2019T23:08:00,Nekonny,it's just an element
28-02-2019T23:08:03,Ordithus,"They do balance pretty close to the head, but that axe is on another level"
28-02-2019T23:08:04,NezumiYuki,"I could be wrong, but I think Ron intends for this cute fluff tail to be holding and counter-balancing her axe."
28-02-2019T23:08:07,Nekonny,I had to draw it somewhere
28-02-2019T23:08:48,Mippy,I just choked on my sirracha
28-02-2019T23:08:48,Nekonny,see?
28-02-2019T23:08:57,Ordithus,Woah
28-02-2019T23:09:06,NezumiYuki,"Owwww, you okay Mipps?"
28-02-2019T23:09:17,Nekonny,yeah be careful mips  XD
28-02-2019T23:09:19,NezumiYuki,Sirracha is hot stuff!
28-02-2019T23:09:33,LannAF,HOWDY!
28-02-2019T23:09:38,NezumiYuki,Hi hi Lann
28-02-2019T23:09:40,SageSaga,i will always recommend to avoid choking on things because you need air to live
28-02-2019T23:09:49,Nekonny,^
28-02-2019T23:09:50,LannAF,Hiya Nezumi! :D
28-02-2019T23:09:55,SageSaga,yo Lann
28-02-2019T23:09:56,BadFoMo,So that's not it's finale location?
28-02-2019T23:09:58,LannAF,and who says I don't breathe through my skin sage
28-02-2019T23:10:03,Mippy,"Yeah, I'm fine. I just got to wipe my eye"
28-02-2019T23:10:04,Nekonny,no
28-02-2019T23:10:11,LannAF,...Actually that gave me really bad imagery.
28-02-2019T23:10:14,SageSaga,I know you Lann
28-02-2019T23:10:18,BadFoMo,Ah. Ok then.
28-02-2019T23:10:19,LannAF,"darn, you're right"
28-02-2019T23:10:25,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Lann
28-02-2019T23:10:37,Combak,"Hi Lann,"
28-02-2019T23:10:43,LannAF,The concept of someone's skin filling and emptying like lungs is terrifying though
28-02-2019T23:10:44,SageSaga,ive see you in-taking air with your face holes
28-02-2019T23:10:48,LannAF,"Hiya Marv, Hiya Combak :D"
28-02-2019T23:10:56,unsteddyphoenix,Yo Lann
28-02-2019T23:11:00,LannAF,maybe I was simply trying to hide my special abilities
28-02-2019T23:11:02,LannAF,YO unsteddy
28-02-2019T23:11:12,Combak,"Ron, why isn't that axe falling down?"
28-02-2019T23:11:26,NezumiYuki,HOLY CRAP!   Ron...  Dat Axe be THICC Yo!
28-02-2019T23:11:27,Combak,... And I finished that too late. XD
28-02-2019T23:11:38,SageSaga,Combak- unlike IRL animated things dont move on their own under gravity
28-02-2019T23:11:41,LannAF,That's like a greataxe from darksouls
28-02-2019T23:11:55,NezumiYuki,She got that Axe boi!
28-02-2019T23:12:11,LannAF,question: which would you all prefer
28-02-2019T23:12:14,Nekonny,Cause I havent drawn the hand yet
28-02-2019T23:12:33,LannAF,"Localized gravity control giving things negative gravity, or positive gravity"
28-02-2019T23:12:51,Combak,... Yes?
28-02-2019T23:12:52,LannAF,"like making things heavier or lighter, in a sense."
28-02-2019T23:12:57,unsteddyphoenix,negative gravity...
28-02-2019T23:13:20,microbuss,oh am I here? duh I was doing else things
28-02-2019T23:13:22,SageSaga,if you can do one you can probably do the other
28-02-2019T23:13:30,Mippy,Did you just assume the polarity of the gravity?
28-02-2019T23:13:35,LannAF,baha
28-02-2019T23:13:40,NezumiYuki,LOL well welcome bak Busses
28-02-2019T23:13:45,Combak,"And if you can't, you can probably mimic it somehow."
28-02-2019T23:13:54,LannAF,I guess it'd be more like repulsion and...whatever the inverse of repulsion is
28-02-2019T23:13:55,microbuss,hey I never left
28-02-2019T23:13:56,LannAF,pullsion
28-02-2019T23:14:05,Combak,Attraction
28-02-2019T23:14:08,LannAF,there you go
28-02-2019T23:14:16,LannAF,I've had a rough day so my thinking isn't exactly good.
28-02-2019T23:14:17,SageSaga,i like the idea of increasing gravity by stealing it from elsewhere
28-02-2019T23:14:24,microbuss,who is Tk drawing?
28-02-2019T23:14:24,BadFoMo,What if that's just a hatchit and she is just a slightly over-sized squirrel?
28-02-2019T23:14:33,SageSaga,so you have to make something lighter to make something else heavier
28-02-2019T23:14:37,LannAF,I had a dream of that Sage
28-02-2019T23:14:38,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:ctwokinds-nibsdance:
28-02-2019T23:14:50,MuonNeutrino,BOUNCY
28-02-2019T23:14:51,LannAF,"I had boots that would steal gravity temporarily, but apply it later"
28-02-2019T23:14:57,NezumiYuki,"Bounce Dat Window, Tom!"
28-02-2019T23:15:07,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-excited: bounciness
28-02-2019T23:15:09,Combak,"Also, just putting a repulsive force behind something would be the same as putting an attractive one in front of it, and vice versa."
28-02-2019T23:15:13,microbuss,:ptv-RainbowThrowup:
28-02-2019T23:15:15,LannAF,"So I could run on walls/jump really high, but as soon as I stopped using it, it'd force me downwards hard"
28-02-2019T23:15:27,LannAF,but it wouldn't break my bones
28-02-2019T23:15:28,MuonNeutrino,i went and got the entire soundtrack to this game because of hearing this song here >.>
28-02-2019T23:15:32,LannAF,just kinda anchor me
28-02-2019T23:15:41,SageSaga,if you removed gravity from an object it should leave earth on its own
28-02-2019T23:16:04,LannAF,"Well, reduction in gravity"
28-02-2019T23:16:05,Combak,Or impact Earth.
28-02-2019T23:16:14,SageSaga,gravity is one of the main driving forces that keeps things from flying off the planet- negating it completely should spin you off of it
28-02-2019T23:16:24,MuonNeutrino,if you removed gravity from an object it would shoot off in a straight line across the solar system
28-02-2019T23:16:43,Combak,So says the neutrino. XD
28-02-2019T23:16:50,MuonNeutrino,more or less
28-02-2019T23:16:59,SageSaga,yeah because its traveling at the speed the earth is spinning but no longer grounded to the earth
28-02-2019T23:17:13,MuonNeutrino,"and it's also traveling at the speed the earth is orbiting around the sun, too"
28-02-2019T23:17:21,SageSaga,yep
28-02-2019T23:17:29,Combak,+ Rotational speed.
28-02-2019T23:17:31,LannAF,WEEEEEE
28-02-2019T23:17:39,SageSaga,and the speed the earth is moving through space with the sun
28-02-2019T23:17:39,BadFoMo,@microbuss Maddie and her mother.
28-02-2019T23:17:52,MuonNeutrino,"yup, although you wouldn't be able to tell that last one from inside the solar system"
28-02-2019T23:18:01,Combak,+ Speed of the sun around the Milky Way.
28-02-2019T23:18:06,MuonNeutrino,yup
28-02-2019T23:18:07,SageSaga,yeah because they are all moving at the same speed
28-02-2019T23:18:10,MuonNeutrino,yeah
28-02-2019T23:18:20,SageSaga,though i wonder-
28-02-2019T23:18:43,SageSaga,would there be a side of the planet you could be on that would accelerate you into the earth rather than off it?
28-02-2019T23:19:05,Combak,You'd just need to be in a canyon for that to happen.
28-02-2019T23:19:05,MuonNeutrino,uhhhh
28-02-2019T23:19:07,MuonNeutrino,i dont THINK so
28-02-2019T23:19:11,LannAF,what combak said probs
28-02-2019T23:19:17,MuonNeutrino,well yeah barring that
28-02-2019T23:19:25,LannAF,Because without gravity there's no difference where it happens
28-02-2019T23:19:34,LannAF,it's the same force being applied in all instances
28-02-2019T23:19:38,SageSaga,Lann but you have 3 points of movement
28-02-2019T23:19:39,Nekonny,I never quite got wht there isn't a greater effect of angular momentum at the equator than at the poles
28-02-2019T23:19:40,MuonNeutrino,"relative to the earth, no i dont think there's any place where that'd happen, sage"
28-02-2019T23:19:44,SageSaga,1 of those points doesnt matter
28-02-2019T23:19:46,NezumiYuki,Guys... Speed of Earth rotation + speed of orbital rotation around sun + speed of sun around local arm of Milky way + speed of milkway in relation to local group + speed of local group in relation to regional cluster + speed of local super group in relati
28-02-2019T23:19:48,SageSaga,but the other 2 do
28-02-2019T23:20:22,SageSaga,yeah speed moving with the sun and everything beyond that doesnt matter
28-02-2019T23:20:23,LannAF,"true, I guess that means you'd need to know the acceleration of the earth's orbit around the sun versus the rotational speed of the earth"
28-02-2019T23:20:27,MuonNeutrino,"@NezumiYuki yes, but only the first two of those matter from the point of view of anything inside the solar system, for this question at least"
28-02-2019T23:20:43,MuonNeutrino,the rotational speed at the equator is 400-odd m/s
28-02-2019T23:20:50,microbuss,well I gtg need TV & movies but gotta go out to a few dumpsters 1st  hehe
28-02-2019T23:20:57,LannAF,what about the earth's orbit itself?
28-02-2019T23:20:59,Nekonny,I go on the teacpus and  I feel every change of direction
28-02-2019T23:20:59,MuonNeutrino,"the earth's orbital velocity is much larger, like 20-odd km/s"
28-02-2019T23:21:03,NezumiYuki,nite nite Busbus
28-02-2019T23:21:04,Combak,"I'm pretty sure most of those speeds are at different orders of magnitude, so most of them will not matter."
28-02-2019T23:21:12,MuonNeutrino,"however, the SPEED isn't what's important, it's the *acceleration* that's important"
28-02-2019T23:21:17,Nekonny,why doesnt that happen to everythign on the surface
28-02-2019T23:21:20,MuonNeutrino,the object starts out sharing those exact same speeds
28-02-2019T23:21:26,SageSaga,30km per second for the earth around the sun
28-02-2019T23:21:28,LannAF,like Muon said Nekonny
28-02-2019T23:21:36,MuonNeutrino,so what matters is how fast the earth accelerates away from the object
28-02-2019T23:21:38,LannAF,"It's acceleration, not speed that's the problem"
28-02-2019T23:21:58,MuonNeutrino,"relative to the surface, the object is going to start falling behind and drifting upwards"
28-02-2019T23:22:07,LannAF,that
28-02-2019T23:22:08,MuonNeutrino,"mostly upwards, at first"
28-02-2019T23:22:09,LannAF,sounds horrifying

28-02-2019T23:22:30,LannAF,sage.
28-02-2019T23:22:30,MuonNeutrino,"the earth's orbital acceleration is going to be a much smaller effect, i think"

28-02-2019T23:23:08,LannAF,but the concept of being dragged along the earth until being pulled up
