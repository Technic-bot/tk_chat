26-09-2019T04:54:41,SomeNiceUser,I tasted my coffee jello.
26-09-2019T05:41:21,CrimsonQuill,Good...morning? Afternoon? I don't even know now...
26-09-2019T05:41:52,CrimsonQuill,...I'm just tired...
26-09-2019T05:52:40,CrimsonQuill,It's been a little bit since I last came here...
26-09-2019T05:57:05,SomeNiceUser,Morning Quill!
26-09-2019T05:57:34,CrimsonQuill,Hello there NiceUser.

26-09-2019T06:04:50,SomeNiceUser,"When I get a graphics tablet, I'm gonna make some funny stuff with it to begin wit, just for practice."
26-09-2019T06:05:09,CrimsonQuill,I don't think I'll be here for a while.
26-09-2019T06:05:18,CrimsonQuill,Things are very...turbulent at present.
26-09-2019T06:05:22,SomeNiceUser,"Also, I should get a pfp"
26-09-2019T06:05:26,SomeNiceUser,Oh.
26-09-2019T06:05:55,CrimsonQuill,Hopefully those job applications'll pay off and I can pay for my internal repeat.
26-09-2019T06:06:41,SomeNiceUser,"Good luck with the applications, you'll certainly need."
26-09-2019T06:06:57,CrimsonQuill,Cheers.
26-09-2019T06:07:13,CrimsonQuill,I'm probably going to go off Patreon for October too...
26-09-2019T06:07:25,CrimsonQuill,I don't quite feel...worthy.
26-09-2019T06:07:33,CrimsonQuill,Y'know what I mean?
26-09-2019T06:07:55,SomeNiceUser,I know.
26-09-2019T06:08:02,CrimsonQuill,"Just...a feeling that I can't really go into some of my favourite stuff at the moment, because I don't quite feel right."
26-09-2019T06:08:53,SomeNiceUser,I got too many ideas right now for sketch suggestions.
26-09-2019T06:09:08,SomeNiceUser,I can make a list too.
26-09-2019T06:09:28,CrimsonQuill,"Heh, well, the Raine and Red kiss scene hasn't been having any luck anyhow..."
26-09-2019T06:09:41,CrimsonQuill,"So it's ok, really."
26-09-2019T06:11:22,SomeNiceUser,"Yeah, maybe some time off will help. And you may find te source of your discomfort."
26-09-2019T06:12:05,CrimsonQuill,I know what I need to do...it's doing it that's the problem.
26-09-2019T06:12:21,SomeNiceUser,Why's that?
26-09-2019T06:12:34,CrimsonQuill,"I'm a lazy, procrastinating git, that's why."
26-09-2019T06:12:43,CrimsonQuill,But I aim to fix that.
26-09-2019T06:12:53,CrimsonQuill,"No, scratch 'aim', I WILL fix it."
26-09-2019T06:13:26,CrimsonQuill,Today I think I'll go down to the local gym...see if they need any staff to clean equipment...that could really help.
26-09-2019T06:13:31,SomeNiceUser,That's the way to go! :ptv-victory:
26-09-2019T06:13:35,CrimsonQuill,I also have an application sent to Aldi.
26-09-2019T06:13:57,CrimsonQuill,And I am considering recruiting for the Royal Engineers Surveying branch.
26-09-2019T06:14:14,CrimsonQuill,"On-the-job training, plus a real boost  for a surveying career!"
26-09-2019T06:14:31,CrimsonQuill,"On the other hand, I'd probably miss a lot of TK stuff.."
26-09-2019T06:15:12,CrimsonQuill,I also met my favourite author's agent and publisher in Trinity College.
26-09-2019T06:15:26,CrimsonQuill,"Terry Pratchett's publisher, Colin Smythe. Lovely man."

26-09-2019T16:37:26,TeapotOfDoom,I mostly buy them from amazon. But there are other places as well to get keys from that are completely legal

26-09-2019T17:16:36,tehbear,what happened to Crimson?
26-09-2019T17:17:34,SomeNiceUser,I heard that he's gonna go do something for quite a while.
26-09-2019T17:19:39,tehbear,sounds serious
26-09-2019T17:20:25,SomeNiceUser,"Nah, he's trying to be more productive."
26-09-2019T17:20:40,tehbear,sounds sensible
26-09-2019T17:21:06,SomeNiceUser,"""I'm a lazy, procrastinating git, that's why. But I aim to fix that. No, scratch 'aim', I WILL fix it."""
26-09-2019T17:21:52,SomeNiceUser,"Yeah, I had my laptop open the entire time, and I still have the chat logs."
26-09-2019T17:22:40,tehbear,"hm. didnt thinking hanging out here took too much of his time. otoh, hes almost always here when i visit"
26-09-2019T17:23:16,tehbear,pomodoro technique works pretty well wrt procastrination imo
26-09-2019T17:23:54,TeapotOfDoom,Pomodoro?
26-09-2019T17:24:01,TeapotOfDoom,That's a sauce for pasta
26-09-2019T17:24:12,SomeNiceUser,lol
26-09-2019T17:24:48,SomeNiceUser,It's a technique to manage time.
26-09-2019T17:26:05,SomeNiceUser,I downloaded Clip Studio Paint.
26-09-2019T17:26:30,SomeNiceUser,"It's just the trial version, but it works."
26-09-2019T17:26:37,AspiringNoodle,"mmm, fresh laundry"
26-09-2019T17:26:50,tehbear,its the best
26-09-2019T17:26:55,TeapotOfDoom,indeed
26-09-2019T17:27:20,TeapotOfDoom,i made a synth with just an impact sample
26-09-2019T17:27:26,SomeNiceUser,sniffs laundry intensly.
26-09-2019T17:27:27,TeapotOfDoom,and had an idea ima try this
26-09-2019T17:27:58,tehbear,put it on soundcloud?
26-09-2019T17:28:07,tehbear,is it any good?
26-09-2019T17:28:19,SomeNiceUser,That seems pretty intersting.
26-09-2019T17:28:32,TeapotOfDoom,nope i forgot the pitch was controlled by the delay time
26-09-2019T17:28:54,TeapotOfDoom,i thought about making a preset from it
26-09-2019T17:29:20,TeapotOfDoom,but now the pitch just controlls the way it sounds not the actual pitch
26-09-2019T17:30:33,TeapotOfDoom,it's just a loop atm. i tried remaking this: https://youtu.be/l5snSyME_-o?t=287
26-09-2019T17:38:43,AspiringNoodle,I'm so tired of being sick with the same thing for the past month
26-09-2019T17:38:52,AspiringNoodle,So I am vigorously cleaning things
26-09-2019T17:40:02,SomeNiceUser,"The rgb on my keyboard stopped working all of a sudden, so I turned it off and on."
26-09-2019T17:40:15,TeapotOfDoom,I just opend a larger project file I'm working on and the sample stretching completely messed up the pitch of almost everything
26-09-2019T17:40:25,TeapotOfDoom,this sounds aweful...
26-09-2019T17:41:36,SomeNiceUser,I am courius on how it sounds right now...
26-09-2019T17:42:15,TeapotOfDoom,it's a remix. i used a heavily filtered sample of the original augmented by synths
26-09-2019T17:42:33,SomeNiceUser,Currently I mean.
26-09-2019T17:42:34,TeapotOfDoom,the synths are in the right pitch but the sample is 3 semitones off
26-09-2019T17:43:01,TeapotOfDoom,it just sounds out of pitch in the worst possible way
26-09-2019T17:44:03,TeapotOfDoom,restretching all the channels for the 3rd time now...
26-09-2019T17:44:21,TeapotOfDoom,tempo changes in fl are so poorly implemented
26-09-2019T17:46:12,TeapotOfDoom,i had to change the strech mode of every single sample i wanted tempo corrected to stretch and back to auto
26-09-2019T17:46:14,TeapotOfDoom,WHY:::
26-09-2019T17:46:26,SomeNiceUser,Oh no...
26-09-2019T17:46:39,TeapotOfDoom,now it finally workd
26-09-2019T17:46:51,SomeNiceUser,yay
26-09-2019T17:47:19,TeapotOfDoom,now i know what I'll have to do every damn time i want to open this project file
26-09-2019T17:49:23,SomeNiceUser,At least you know what to do.
26-09-2019T17:49:51,TeapotOfDoom,i'm not even sure if I'm gonna keep the tempo change
26-09-2019T17:50:08,TeapotOfDoom,going from 128 to 145 was to harsh ima try 135
26-09-2019T17:50:49,SomeNiceUser,Any news?
26-09-2019T17:51:21,TeapotOfDoom,better
26-09-2019T17:51:32,SomeNiceUser,Nice.
26-09-2019T17:52:23,TeapotOfDoom,but it lost the genre change. i still have a copy without the transition i think i'm alling back to that
26-09-2019T17:52:36,SomeNiceUser,Oh.
26-09-2019T17:53:17,TeapotOfDoom,i tried going from electro house-y to happy hardcore but the main synth gets a bit to hectic imo
26-09-2019T17:53:23,TeapotOfDoom,it's to much
26-09-2019T17:54:05,TeapotOfDoom,well at least i won't have to deal with fl being stupid when changing tempo
26-09-2019T17:54:32,SomeNiceUser,Yup!
26-09-2019T17:55:27,SomeNiceUser,"Since I don't have a tablet for Clip Studio Paint, ima use a mouse."
26-09-2019T17:56:24,TeapotOfDoom,drawing with mouse is quite the challenge
26-09-2019T17:56:52,TeapotOfDoom,if you're only able to use that i would suggest starting with vector graphics

26-09-2019T21:08:47,Venemes,Guys guys - Wolf raine is just raine with fur
26-09-2019T21:09:08,ThingsAreMoving,And pawpads
26-09-2019T21:09:08,Venemes,This is blasphemy
26-09-2019T21:09:13,Venemes,"And beans, yes"
26-09-2019T21:09:14,ThingsAreMoving,and a muzzle
26-09-2019T21:09:22,ThingsAreMoving,and rows... :ctwokinds-NoraEyebrows:
26-09-2019T21:09:27,Shierna,Which means Raine is just Wolf Raine WITHOUT fur.... hubba hubba!
26-09-2019T21:09:36,RimaDraws,paw beans
26-09-2019T21:09:56,CrimsonHelsing,^^^
26-09-2019T21:09:58,BadFoMo,I'm fine with Human or Halfling Raine (Too many Furries as it is).)

26-09-2019T21:10:03,BadFoMo,*too
26-09-2019T21:10:11,CrimsonHelsing,"basically kinda like video game logic, same player, different skin"
26-09-2019T21:10:28,Shierna,hisses @ BadFoMo
26-09-2019T21:10:34,BadFoMo,...*).
26-09-2019T21:10:35,Nekonny,I should give clip another go perhaps yeah
26-09-2019T21:10:36,AnuSekaniArt,XD
26-09-2019T21:11:02,Kufky,Any Raine is good Raine :).
26-09-2019T21:11:02,Venemes,Raine's just in her mega form
26-09-2019T21:11:31,ThingsAreMoving,"Is bad Raine a good Raine, too?"
26-09-2019T21:11:52,Venemes,Wolf raine is just Wii Fit trainer's fursona
26-09-2019T21:11:52,Sclimshady,"All Rain is good, even bad Raine"
26-09-2019T21:12:00,MuonNeutrino,bad..... Raine.......? O.o
26-09-2019T21:12:08,MuonNeutrino,those letters do not make sense to me in that order
26-09-2019T21:12:10,BadFoMo,Bad Wolf?
26-09-2019T21:12:15,Kufky,Awoo?
26-09-2019T21:12:16,Sclimshady,O.O
26-09-2019T21:12:20,Venemes,Noooo shes a good girl
26-09-2019T21:12:20,Nekonny,and somehow the pen has transparency here...
26-09-2019T21:12:20,ThingsAreMoving,":ctwokinds-rainehappy: *[I may be bad, but I feel... Gooood!]"
26-09-2019T21:12:38,Venemes,ImPoStEr
26-09-2019T21:12:40,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Bad Raine is just Raine that uses the banana peel in mario kart
26-09-2019T21:12:48,Venemes,No she uses blue shell
26-09-2019T21:12:51,ThingsAreMoving,the blue shell
26-09-2019T21:12:56,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Thats Evil Raine
26-09-2019T21:12:58,Sclimshady,Thats evil Raine
26-09-2019T21:13:02,Sclimshady,Dang
26-09-2019T21:13:05,MuonNeutrino,"also red must have a head made of solid bone to just be all ""i'm fine"" after that, but then again we already knew that >.>"
26-09-2019T21:13:12,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Great minds think alike

26-09-2019T21:14:01,Kufky,Is Bad Raine the Raine in her own fics?
26-09-2019T21:14:04,MarvTheHugPharaoh,We are the collective

26-09-2019T21:14:17,ThingsAreMoving,:ctwokinds-nibsdance:
26-09-2019T21:14:20,Venemes,I really want to see a pic of Wolf Raine playing like a gameboy or the wii lol
26-09-2019T21:14:40,AnuSekaniArt,:ctwokinds-nibsdance:
26-09-2019T21:14:54,Tharkis,"biggest problem for me with CSP which i have a copy of, is that i've used PS for so long"
26-09-2019T21:15:01,Tharkis,that i cant find the tool i want to do the thing i want when editing something
26-09-2019T21:15:04,RimaDraws,i love CSP
26-09-2019T21:15:05,Shierna,Switch...
26-09-2019T21:15:06,Tharkis,and get frustrated before learning how to find it
26-09-2019T21:15:08,RimaDraws,its my main program
26-09-2019T21:15:11,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Same Tharkis
26-09-2019T21:15:17,Tharkis,"since i dont draw, and just edit  / touch up"
26-09-2019T21:15:28,Tharkis,i've still got an ancient version of photoshop i bought when i graduated from college
26-09-2019T21:15:29,Venemes,I use CSP and Procreate normally but procreate can be a bit awkward
26-09-2019T21:15:36,AnuSekaniArt,I only use Sketchbook right now but I mainly just do traditional
26-09-2019T21:15:44,Nekonny,"Tharkis, you know my pain"
26-09-2019T21:15:46,Tharkis,i paid the 10$ for procreate for my ipad
26-09-2019T21:15:47,AnuSekaniArt,*for digital art anyway
26-09-2019T21:15:51,ThingsAreMoving,Graphics programs are sorcery for me
26-09-2019T21:15:59,Venemes,"Remember everyone, better programs dont mean better art~!"
26-09-2019T21:16:00,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I tried CSP's free trail and I just could not get into it.
26-09-2019T21:16:07,AspiringNoodle,I would love Photoshop
26-09-2019T21:16:14,AspiringNoodle,But Adobe is a giant butt :ptv-unimpressed:
26-09-2019T21:16:34,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-KatDance:
26-09-2019T21:16:36,Venemes,"Honestly as free things go, Firealpacas pretty good"
26-09-2019T21:16:37,ThingsAreMoving,"Need a giant paddle, then"
26-09-2019T21:16:39,Nekonny,I guess... perhaps this is the way it is?
26-09-2019T21:16:44,Venemes,I dont get why so many people like Gimp tho
26-09-2019T21:16:57,ThingsAreMoving,It's free?
26-09-2019T21:16:59,Nekonny,I don't recall this brush it being semi transparent
26-09-2019T21:17:02,AnuSekaniArt,Yeah it's free lol
26-09-2019T21:17:03,CrRAR,Just been around forever
26-09-2019T21:17:05,SageSaga,I used Photoshop for 14 years before CSP came out-
26-09-2019T21:17:12,SageSaga,i didnt have much of an issue switching over
26-09-2019T21:17:15,AnuSekaniArt,I've used Paint Tool SAI before as well.
26-09-2019T21:17:35,Venemes,I heard sai's pretty good
26-09-2019T21:17:44,Venemes,"I just bought CSP when it was 50% off, which is often lol"
26-09-2019T21:17:50,SageSaga,SAI is for people who dont have CSP
26-09-2019T21:17:54,Nekonny,it is
26-09-2019T21:18:01,Nekonny,very good
26-09-2019T21:18:03,CrRAR,haha
26-09-2019T21:18:24,SemuElo,I was using a lot SAI
26-09-2019T21:18:31,SemuElo,from 2018 jumpted to SAI 2
26-09-2019T21:18:39,Venemes,Ok but new question - Whats the *worst* art program
26-09-2019T21:18:40,RimaDraws,sai 2 is okay
26-09-2019T21:18:47,SemuElo,And now me at Csp from few month ago
26-09-2019T21:18:55,RimaDraws,sai 2 helps me in aspects that CSP dont
26-09-2019T21:19:02,AnuSekaniArt,MS Paint :P
26-09-2019T21:19:08,Venemes,Mario paint! xD
26-09-2019T21:19:09,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Now thats a Pro tool
26-09-2019T21:19:18,Nekonny,potato paint
26-09-2019T21:19:24,AspiringNoodle,I'm so glad I got CSP for $25 <3
26-09-2019T21:19:27,SemuElo,dunno
26-09-2019T21:19:37,Nekonny,semu!
26-09-2019T21:19:39,SemuElo,But i long ago started to dislike photoshop
26-09-2019T21:20:00,SemuElo,Neko :csemuelo-zombiedance:
26-09-2019T21:20:10,Venemes,"I used photoshop once but between me being new at art and the program not being focused on drawing, it was annoying"
26-09-2019T21:20:31,IronHorseComics,I use CSP for sketches and linework and I use photoshop for the rest
26-09-2019T21:20:51,AnuSekaniArt,At the moment I try and stick to traditional.
26-09-2019T21:20:51,Venemes,What like shading and highlights?
26-09-2019T21:20:52,RimaDraws,like i said i can't afford PS
26-09-2019T21:21:06,AspiringNoodle,Photoshop is BS in its current payment model
26-09-2019T21:21:11,IronHorseComics,"coloring, lettering, sound effects, shading everything"
26-09-2019T21:21:11,ZoopBoopLoop,">Red not impaled on Magical Shrapnel, now a woof as well"
26-09-2019T21:21:18,AspiringNoodle,Pay-to-Use :ptv-unimpressed:
26-09-2019T21:21:18,Sclimshady,"Yeah, PS monthly sub is kinda bs"
26-09-2019T21:21:18,SomeNiceUser,pc got the blue screen of ded
26-09-2019T21:21:21,Venemes,Yeah you cant even cancel the monthly until 6 months I believe
26-09-2019T21:21:22,AnuSekaniArt,but I've also not gone beyond lineart
26-09-2019T21:21:36,AnuSekaniArt,Eyo SNU
26-09-2019T21:21:56,SomeNiceUser,Hi Anu!
26-09-2019T21:22:07,IronHorseComics,honestly I'm still not sold on CSP
26-09-2019T21:22:21,SageSaga,why not?
26-09-2019T21:22:37,SemuElo,Also Neko i was lurking u long >:O
26-09-2019T21:22:47,Nekonny,XD
26-09-2019T21:22:58,SemuElo,:csemuelo-everywhere:
26-09-2019T21:22:58,Nekonny,ugh
26-09-2019T21:23:02,Nekonny,somethign is off
26-09-2019T21:23:14,IronHorseComics,"because it's a one trick pony, and even then I find to have less trouble on PS when working with lineart"
26-09-2019T21:23:17,Nekonny,it shouldnt be this transparent
26-09-2019T21:23:40,SageSaga,how is it a one trick pony?
26-09-2019T21:23:59,Sclimshady,"You cam only draw, I guess?"
26-09-2019T21:24:23,ThingsAreMoving,holy damn it's 3:24 in the morning. gotta bounce before i destroy my sleep schedule.
26-09-2019T21:24:26,IronHorseComics,I feel like it's only good for making lineart and comic panel layouts
26-09-2019T21:24:29,Kufky,I find GIMP acceptable. I know a lot of people don't.
26-09-2019T21:24:30,AnuSekaniArt,Take care Things!
26-09-2019T21:24:31,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nighty night Things <3
26-09-2019T21:24:33,ThingsAreMoving,"Thanks for the entertainment, guys, See ya next time"

26-09-2019T21:24:38,ThingsAreMoving,:ctwokinds-nibsdance:
26-09-2019T21:24:39,SageSaga,not coloring?
26-09-2019T21:24:41,BadFoMo,I like Gimp.
26-09-2019T21:24:42,IronHorseComics,nope
26-09-2019T21:24:44,AnuSekaniArt,:ctwokinds-nibsdance:
26-09-2019T21:24:50,SageSaga,how is it not good for coloring?
26-09-2019T21:25:03,SageSaga,it can do just about everything photoshop can
26-09-2019T21:25:11,Sclimshady,Night Things o/
26-09-2019T21:25:19,MuonNeutrino,"except anything having to do with vector art, at least as far as i can tell"
26-09-2019T21:25:25,BadFoMo,@ThingsAreMoving Bye.
26-09-2019T21:25:26,MuonNeutrino,gimp's text support is bad
26-09-2019T21:25:32,SageSaga,i do vectors all the time with Clip
26-09-2019T21:25:36,BadFoMo,It is?
26-09-2019T21:25:37,RimaDraws,i do everything art on CSP majority of the time
26-09-2019T21:25:51,Nekonny,there we go
26-09-2019T21:25:52,SageSaga,all of my comics are all done in Clip
26-09-2019T21:25:57,RimaDraws,^
26-09-2019T21:26:03,MuonNeutrino,oh whoops i mixed two conversations
26-09-2019T21:26:11,MuonNeutrino,"thought you were talking about gimp, sage"
26-09-2019T21:26:17,Nekonny,Clip is pretty roubust
26-09-2019T21:26:18,MuonNeutrino,sorry XD
26-09-2019T21:26:26,Tharkis,"i nabbed a copy of CSP a year ago when it was cheap like 45 bucks , needed it to open some clp files and some newere PSD files that my old version of photoshop wouldnt open"
26-09-2019T21:26:41,Nekonny,photoshop is still better at some things tho
26-09-2019T21:26:50,IronHorseComics,type for sure
26-09-2019T21:27:02,Nekonny,"thats one thing,"
26-09-2019T21:27:04,SageSaga,Clip had an update for Text
26-09-2019T21:27:11,Tharkis,photoshops mesh and liquify warp tools
26-09-2019T21:27:18,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Photoshop seems to run smoother on my pc, CSP has lag spikes here there when I was using the trail"
26-09-2019T21:27:18,Tharkis,are way superior to any other program still
26-09-2019T21:27:21,Venemes,Oh yeah liquify
26-09-2019T21:27:27,Nekonny,the best thing I liked about clip was thir word ballon tool
26-09-2019T21:28:46,AnuSekaniArt,Feel like the best thing to do to find the ideal art program would be to use free trials (if they have them) over a weekend and just experiment
26-09-2019T21:28:57,SageSaga,Clip had better brush options to Photoshop last i was using photoshop- but that has changed i know
26-09-2019T21:29:05,Nekonny,I usually bootstrap a bunh of programs anyway
26-09-2019T21:29:20,Nekonny,there is rarely a single step solution for everythign
26-09-2019T21:29:38,Nekonny,SAI has the best blending tool and pen hands down
26-09-2019T21:29:47,Nekonny,thats why I stuck with it for so long
26-09-2019T21:29:52,AnuSekaniArt,Plenty of folks I know use one method for sketching/linearting and another for coloring/shading/rendering.
26-09-2019T21:29:58,Nekonny,and the canvas flip/rotate
26-09-2019T21:30:04,Nekonny,photoshop has caught up now
26-09-2019T21:30:21,SageSaga,yeah photoshops rotate used to be horrible
26-09-2019T21:31:23,IronHorseComics,"I just wish adobe didn't fuck up the transform option, now if you wanna distort something you hold down shift but not if you want to do it proportionally"
26-09-2019T21:31:53,SageSaga,so they reversed it? XD
26-09-2019T21:32:03,SageSaga,probably good for new people
26-09-2019T21:32:06,Venemes,"Oh yeahhhh I remember that, that was super annoying"
26-09-2019T21:32:32,IronHorseComics,they finally fixed the ctrl+z thing but in that same patch they reversed it
26-09-2019T21:32:44,IronHorseComics,*reversed the transform tool
26-09-2019T21:33:08,IronHorseComics,"but if they wanted it to be that way for new users, they should have done it for ALL of their programs, not just photoshop"
26-09-2019T21:34:03,AspiringNoodle,"I swear, adobe has gotten lazy / super greedy with their ""industry standard"" status -_-"
26-09-2019T21:36:01,IronHorseComics,"I just roll my eyes when people whine about the subscription based service. I've heard it so much over the years that I've gone deaf from it. I don't care that it costs more in the long run, I have a stable job and I USE this stuff on a near daily basis"
26-09-2019T21:36:13,RimaDraws,ill see you guys soon i need to head home
26-09-2019T21:36:18,Twokinds,brb

26-09-2019T21:36:45,RimaDraws,im not leaving just going home
26-09-2019T21:36:48,Nekonny,not for people that dont make a living off of it though
26-09-2019T21:36:50,Sclimshady,Tom o/
26-09-2019T21:36:53,SamuelCuucu,OWO looking good Tom!
26-09-2019T21:36:54,Mihari,I wouldn't mind the subscription service if I had the option to just buy it outright if I wanted tho.
26-09-2019T21:36:56,ContagiousBordem16,Riiiiiima hi
26-09-2019T21:37:01,RimaDraws,hi

26-09-2019T22:24:02,DesertFox,The translation was brutality @.@
26-09-2019T22:24:14,Mihari,That evil programm...
26-09-2019T22:24:20,DesertFox,...
26-09-2019T22:24:25,Nekonny,evil?
26-09-2019T22:24:29,DesertFox,I just crashed twice in a row...
26-09-2019T22:24:36,SageSaga,it doesnt allow for proper boob physics
26-09-2019T22:24:38,Mihari,"If I need to explain why it's evil to, Ron..."
26-09-2019T22:24:45,LannAF,sage
26-09-2019T22:24:47,LannAF,that's horrible.
26-09-2019T22:24:52,SageSaga,?
26-09-2019T22:24:57,LannAF,improper boob physics
26-09-2019T22:25:07,LannAF,a concept I do not want to consider
26-09-2019T22:25:09,Tharkis,flora's flat enough that it's 'ok' =D
26-09-2019T22:25:12,Tharkis,ok
26-09-2019T22:25:15,SageSaga,look at it- Flora flops all over the place- those kinda boobies dont move like that
26-09-2019T22:25:16,Tharkis,ok
26-09-2019T22:25:17,Mihari,"No Tharkis, it's not."
26-09-2019T22:25:24,LannAF,oh I have streams paused
26-09-2019T22:25:32,Tharkis,"hrm, all my k letter presses are missing"
26-09-2019T22:25:35,Sclimshady,Nice job
26-09-2019T22:25:43,Tharkis,weird
26-09-2019T22:25:57,SageSaga,even larger girls bounce around unnaturally
26-09-2019T22:25:58,ZRO4825,"We're seeing them, Tharkis"
26-09-2019T22:26:00,ZRO4825,Or at least I am.
26-09-2019T22:26:03,Mihari,"I will admit it's nice what it can accomplish, but still."
26-09-2019T22:26:13,ZRO4825,But can it push its physics to Gainax?
26-09-2019T22:26:20,DarthRexKing,"Oh, you switched to the multi."
26-09-2019T22:26:22,PurpleLemons,"jesus Ron, killing with the adorable :eyes:"
26-09-2019T22:26:23,Tharkis,"hehe weird, going to close browser and reload"
26-09-2019T22:26:23,Nekonny,so.... neither sage or mihari are interested in animations.
26-09-2019T22:26:29,Mihari,"That, and I'm not fond of the whole leaning forward and back thing Ron chooses to use a lot XD"
26-09-2019T22:26:31,Tharkis,even my own name shows up as Thar is
26-09-2019T22:26:38,SageSaga,they arent animations
26-09-2019T22:26:44,DesertFox,If it were in English I'd jump back in :P
26-09-2019T22:26:45,SageSaga,its puppetry
26-09-2019T22:26:58,MarvTheHugPharaoh,who ever made cough drops needs a mile high statue.
26-09-2019T22:26:59,Nekonny,isn't all animation in a way
26-09-2019T22:27:03,Nekonny,jk
26-09-2019T22:27:08,Mihari,"And furthermore I've told you several times I wouldn't mind one, just to not do the leaning! >.<"
26-09-2019T22:27:29,DesertFox,:P
26-09-2019T22:27:30,Nekonny,leanig is one of the tools that helps the illusion
26-09-2019T22:27:46,DesertFox,You gotta cheat
26-09-2019T22:27:54,SamuelCuucu,NUU THE SONG ENDED

26-09-2019T22:27:55,Nekonny,"what we do isn't considered art, because it doesnt use real paint"
26-09-2019T22:28:07,Mihari,That's stupid
26-09-2019T22:28:14,Sclimshady,By who?
26-09-2019T22:28:16,Nekonny,so is saying that this isn't animation
26-09-2019T22:28:40,Nekonny,"I mean, it's not full fleged animation, I'll be the first to admit it"
26-09-2019T22:28:40,DesertFox,"I mean, you made custom scenes, didnt you?"
26-09-2019T22:28:45,Nekonny,its ultra lazy
26-09-2019T22:28:56,Nekonny,but it's still animation

26-09-2019T22:34:35,PurpleLemons,being clean is hard
26-09-2019T22:34:48,Tharkis,"i like it, it's over-emphasized motion but you see that in all sorts of cartoons and animated things"
26-09-2019T22:34:49,Sclimshady,?
26-09-2019T22:34:56,LannAF,Purple!

26-09-2019T22:35:14,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Looks great
26-09-2019T22:35:17,AspiringNoodle,I would argue that the animation is good in the same way Tharkis mentioned
26-09-2019T22:35:18,Sclimshady,^
26-09-2019T22:35:21,Mihari,Tharkis is biased and doesn't count XD

26-09-2019T22:35:49,Sclimshady,The animation is super cute too though
26-09-2019T22:35:51,AspiringNoodle,It really depends on what you'er going for
26-09-2019T22:35:51,DesertFox,...
26-09-2019T22:35:59,DesertFox,You people are crashing my computer =-=

26-09-2019T22:36:16,Mihari,"It looks good for the most part, it still looks very unnatural and too jerky. Sure it's fine for the whole 'anime' shtick, but yah..."
26-09-2019T22:36:19,DesertFox,I have to go I think XD
26-09-2019T22:36:20,AspiringNoodle,RIP your Clip :3

26-09-2019T22:39:21,SageSaga,yeah i'd never tell ron to stop making those but I wish the program gave more control to the secondary motions
26-09-2019T22:39:23,LannAF,Hi Rima!
26-09-2019T22:39:28,Sclimshady,Zangi is just punk cotton candy

26-09-2019T22:39:45,LannAF,wonderful job btw on that comic page you did
26-09-2019T22:39:52,Nekonny,secondary motions?
26-09-2019T22:39:52,RimaDraws,oh you saw
26-09-2019T22:39:59,AspiringNoodle,"Something tells me the program wasn't meant for ""subtle"" gestures :ptv-snicker:"
26-09-2019T22:40:05,Mihari,"If you enjoy it, all power to you, it's a fancy tool, just like Sage, I wish it gave you more control over subtle things."
26-09-2019T22:40:05,LannAF,dude why does my stomach hurt so much
26-09-2019T22:40:08,Sclimshady,"Yes,  waiting for more :eyes:"
26-09-2019T22:40:15,SageSaga,secondary motions- motions that occur because of something else moving
26-09-2019T22:40:15,RimaDraws,yea someone made comments on the page saying it was bad and it was a mistake. but im gonna try to make more pahes
26-09-2019T22:40:16,RimaDraws,pages
26-09-2019T22:40:17,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Lann, do you have the flu like I do?"
26-09-2019T22:40:23,LannAF,nop
26-09-2019T22:40:30,LannAF,we are not flu bros
26-09-2019T22:40:37,AspiringNoodle,Rima: First rule of making anything on the interwebz
26-09-2019T22:40:46,AspiringNoodle,"If someone hates it, you're doing something right :ptv-hearts:"
26-09-2019T22:40:49,Nekonny,when did we ever imagine that we were going to be able to see our characters move?
26-09-2019T22:40:50,SageSaga,Lann- spagetti regret thing?
26-09-2019T22:40:58,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Rima, people like those are just jelly they can't do what you are doing"
26-09-2019T22:41:02,Tharkis,"mmm, spaghetti"
26-09-2019T22:41:03,Sclimshady,^
26-09-2019T22:41:05,RimaDraws,*pats lann*
26-09-2019T22:41:05,Mihari,Half Life 3...
26-09-2019T22:41:12,Sclimshady,Im failing all my ^'s
26-09-2019T22:41:19,Mihari,Kidding...
26-09-2019T22:41:23,AspiringNoodle,Did somebody say Half-Life 3 confirmed?!?
26-09-2019T22:41:28,Mihari,"Umm, honestly Garry's Mod era."
26-09-2019T22:41:29,LannAF,nope lann
26-09-2019T22:41:30,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-whiny:
26-09-2019T22:41:37,AspiringNoodle,"Mihari, y u do dis?"
26-09-2019T22:41:44,LannAF,garry's mod era?
26-09-2019T22:41:57,BadFoMo,What about Garry's Mon?
26-09-2019T22:42:01,Mihari,"Yah, figured enough time could learn to model, rig, put it in the game, bam animated character."
26-09-2019T22:42:15,LannAF,animation in garry's mod was fucking stupid
26-09-2019T22:42:23,SageSaga,need better tools for modeling in 3D
26-09-2019T22:42:25,LannAF,even the good tools people provided
26-09-2019T22:42:29,LannAF,were still -asss-
26-09-2019T22:42:36,Mihari,"But if you got it work there, it means down the road you could have put it into source movie maker :P"
26-09-2019T22:42:36,Nekonny,"yeah, but getting that far is another story"
26-09-2019T22:42:47,MarvTheHugPharaoh,DasBoSchitt did gmod animations
26-09-2019T22:42:48,LannAF,depends on how you did it
26-09-2019T22:42:50,Mihari,And that has done magic
26-09-2019T22:42:50,Nekonny,much less being able to do it consistently
26-09-2019T22:42:54,LannAF,it didn't use the same methods
26-09-2019T22:43:03,Mihari,"You asked, I answered."
26-09-2019T22:43:05,LannAF,It was like using an extremely large sledgehammer to hit a tiny nail
26-09-2019T22:43:13,AspiringNoodle,SFM has lead to some of the funniest videos I've ever watched
26-09-2019T22:43:13,Nekonny,we only got one life
26-09-2019T22:43:16,Mihari,If I spent the same amount of time learn 3D that you did learning and using that tool...
26-09-2019T22:43:20,LannAF,gmod animators who didn't constantly sto-frame
26-09-2019T22:43:21,AspiringNoodle,The exaggerated motions you can pull off in that software...
26-09-2019T22:43:22,LannAF,were gods
26-09-2019T22:43:31,BadFoMo,GMod Idiot Box was fun.
26-09-2019T22:43:36,MarvTheHugPharaoh,^
26-09-2019T22:43:38,Mihari,Just sayin'
26-09-2019T22:43:38,LannAF,Kitty0706 (Rest in Piece my man) did so well
26-09-2019T22:43:45,LannAF,"It was, but it...Lost its touch imo"
26-09-2019T22:43:54,Nekonny,eh.... I should look into getting the stand for this
26-09-2019T22:44:05,Mihari,Surprised you didn't
26-09-2019T22:44:15,Mihari,It gets hot and heavy doesn't it?
26-09-2019T22:44:28,AspiringNoodle,screen tablet?
26-09-2019T22:44:30,Nekonny,not really no
26-09-2019T22:44:43,Nekonny,but I like to be able to stand it upright wnen no t in use
26-09-2019T22:44:52,Mihari,Gotcha
26-09-2019T22:44:58,SomeNiceUser,Kitty was a great animator.
26-09-2019T22:45:03,LannAF,He really was
26-09-2019T22:45:15,LannAF,did you see the action animations he made with gmod?
26-09-2019T22:45:19,LannAF,They were fucking insane.
26-09-2019T22:45:21,Mihari,"Bottom line, Ron. If you enjoy that tool, and what it produces and it suits your purposes, great! :3"
26-09-2019T22:45:35,PurpleLemons,"ohh that's why, shape dynamics is bugged"
26-09-2019T22:45:44,SomeNiceUser,I really love his Team Fabulous 2 vid.
26-09-2019T22:45:51,Nekonny,I appreciate that Mihari ^^
26-09-2019T22:45:53,Mihari,I thought it was well used on your cafe site for that little nav and notions for each comic.
26-09-2019T22:45:53,MarvTheHugPharaoh,shape dynamics?
26-09-2019T22:46:12,Mihari,The video was... 'fine' until axe chopping.
26-09-2019T22:46:19,PurpleLemons,yes
26-09-2019T22:46:23,Mihari,disinbodied people moving was creepy
26-09-2019T22:46:32,Nekonny,"yeah, that part was passing the limit of what could be done"
26-09-2019T22:46:44,Nekonny,at that point some licence was used
26-09-2019T22:47:06,Nekonny,disinbodied?
26-09-2019T22:47:10,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Happy Halloween Everybody :skull::ghost::skull:

26-09-2019T22:47:56,Nekonny,"I'm, between switching back to my old 13""cintiq to actually get shiit done and keep powering though on the 16"
26-09-2019T22:48:07,Nekonny,*and -> or
26-09-2019T22:48:08,Mihari,"Seeing Halloween crap in August is too early, and stupid."
26-09-2019T22:48:18,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Oh man, purp when I get paid I need to comm ya for a Kis costume"
26-09-2019T22:48:19,Nekonny,it is the 37h after all
26-09-2019T22:48:33,Sclimshady,Kisara costume :eyes:
26-09-2019T22:48:52,Nekonny,"I switched the Cafe to a fall theme, which does include some pumplins"
26-09-2019T22:49:00,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Don't know what yet, maybe hunters outfit from bloodborne"
26-09-2019T22:49:06,Nekonny,bit it's not overdone I hope
26-09-2019T22:49:08,Mihari,Pumpkins are not all inclusive to Halloween.
26-09-2019T22:49:17,Mihari,Unless you carved them
26-09-2019T22:49:25,Nekonny,"well, they have carved faces ^^"""
26-09-2019T22:49:29,Mihari,Then yes... XD
26-09-2019T22:49:54,Mihari,I would have done a special halloween eve / day theme with the place decorated and the pumpkins carved then
26-09-2019T22:49:57,Nekonny,"it's not overdone tho ^^"""
26-09-2019T22:50:12,Mihari,She's clearly questioning your decision to include them!
26-09-2019T22:50:18,Nekonny,XD
26-09-2019T22:50:21,AnuSekaniArt,I'd love to comm folks but muns :ctwokinds-LauraCry:
26-09-2019T22:50:24,SageSaga,it's not August though so you are ok?
26-09-2019T22:50:31,Tharkis,bah ! pumpkins are an all october thing where I live !

26-09-2019T22:50:35,Mihari,I saw them in August tho Sage...
26-09-2019T22:50:39,Mihari,Ron is fine tho...
26-09-2019T22:50:43,Nekonny,it's too much trouble to keep asking the developer to kepe changing the background for just a one day thing
26-09-2019T22:50:48,Tharkis,the roger williams park zoo has the world's largest carved pumpkin display the month of october =)
26-09-2019T22:50:56,SageSaga,yeah- make sure you only use that in Sept.
26-09-2019T22:50:59,Mihari,You can't change things yourself?
26-09-2019T22:51:10,Nekonny,this is more of the fall theme
26-09-2019T22:51:12,SageSaga,o-O
26-09-2019T22:51:14,Nekonny,which it is?
26-09-2019T22:51:24,SageSaga,yeah but you cant change that kinda thing on your own?
26-09-2019T22:51:38,Nekonny,I guess I could ask about that
26-09-2019T22:51:50,Sclimshady,They look so cute together Purp
26-09-2019T22:51:51,Mihari,"Yes, you should."
26-09-2019T22:51:53,SageSaga,=_= what happens when your developer leaves?
26-09-2019T22:51:56,Tjimmy1999,Raine really didn't want her top removed in front of her crush.
26-09-2019T22:51:59,Nekonny,we tend not to overstep each others areas; helps things flow a bit easier
26-09-2019T22:52:20,Nekonny,then I call muhari :ptv-laugh:
26-09-2019T22:52:23,SageSaga,o_O

26-09-2019T22:53:06,Tharkis,used to be the Keene NH pumpkin fest
26-09-2019T22:53:19,Tharkis,"but when that shut down, now it's the Pumpkin extravaganza at the zoo in RI"
26-09-2019T22:54:03,SageSaga,it doesnt sound like a professional relationship- because if it was - you would be telling the person to do whatever you want- and pay them
26-09-2019T22:54:11,RimaDraws,yea
26-09-2019T22:54:13,RimaDraws,that sounds like...

26-09-2019T22:57:07,Tharkis,@BadFoMo if you read AS you may note the frequent side character scotsman who does deliveries and moves heavy stuff
26-09-2019T22:57:12,Tharkis,and rarely stays a scotsman for long >_<
26-09-2019T22:57:22,Nekonny,https://kemono.cafe/

26-09-2019T22:58:06,SageSaga,you just said you try to keep things separate though
26-09-2019T22:58:16,SageSaga,so they have some influence over what you do

26-09-2019T23:02:11,Tharkis,best raine is the raine doodle i got from Tom as part of his first (or maybe 2nd?) kickstarter =P
26-09-2019T23:02:12,Ordithus,"Raine is always best Raine.  Human, wolf, or whatever"

26-09-2019T23:03:39,SageSaga,you should get your dev to work on making the site easy to manage and modify for when that comes
26-09-2019T23:04:07,Nekonny,"I do than k you gor the advice , you're right, having a backup is a good plan"

26-09-2019T23:32:27,steelabjur,"Depends on the work. I had several jobs that were just mentally void, so I'd just check out and mentally work on things I wanted to work on after I was done."
26-09-2019T23:32:34,w0lfmare,Tom's motivation motivates me

26-09-2019T23:33:28,LannAF,christ I blanket invited people I thought suitable
26-09-2019T23:33:37,LannAF,And like 15 people said yes
26-09-2019T23:33:39,LannAF,That never happens
26-09-2019T23:33:59,MarvTheHugPharaoh,tarkov sounds fun.
26-09-2019T23:34:00,LannAF,I really hope I made my choices right
26-09-2019T23:34:07,LannAF,"yeeee, the new patch is coming within 2 weeks"
26-09-2019T23:34:14,LannAF,apparently. Maybe longer. Maybe shorter.
26-09-2019T23:34:15,Sclimshady,Im still really bad at Tarkov
26-09-2019T23:34:34,RimaDraws,how do those elves have anything to cover lol
26-09-2019T23:34:34,BadFoMo,Trouble in Terrorist Town?

26-09-2019T23:34:47,Ordithus,wb
26-09-2019T23:34:47,w0lfmare,I'm sure it won't be disastrous Lann :cw0lfmare-PaperkiaClose:
26-09-2019T23:34:51,LannAF,I used to play it a LOT.
26-09-2019T23:35:04,LannAF,"My most played gamemode in gmod, with over 2.2k hours in the game"
26-09-2019T23:35:09,BadFoMo,Hey! I guessed right!
26-09-2019T23:35:10,SageSaga,Rima- wat?
26-09-2019T23:35:15,MarvTheHugPharaoh,for TTT you just need Gmod and CS source right?
26-09-2019T23:35:24,LannAF,But that was before youtubers kinda brought in...Really shitty kids into our servers.
26-09-2019T23:35:26,LannAF,Yeah Marv.
26-09-2019T23:35:28,Sclimshady,Yeah
26-09-2019T23:35:30,LannAF,My intention is to wait until a sale
26-09-2019T23:35:33,Combak,"... Wait, TTT patch?"
26-09-2019T23:35:36,LannAF,And then buy the stuff for everyone who needs it.
26-09-2019T23:35:41,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"sweet, middle school me hooked me up"
26-09-2019T23:35:44,LannAF,It goes on sale for less than 5 dollars sometimes.
26-09-2019T23:35:50,RimaDraws,with what marv
26-09-2019T23:36:05,Sclimshady,"its fun, but most people cheat with VC when I play"
26-09-2019T23:36:05,LannAF,We have a roster of fairly funny and nice people so I'm looking forward to it
26-09-2019T23:36:06,MarvTheHugPharaoh,the stuff needed for trouble in terrorist town
26-09-2019T23:36:13,RimaDraws,no marv
26-09-2019T23:36:33,MarvTheHugPharaoh,ok
26-09-2019T23:37:31,SageSaga,i have an unbeatable Tactic in TTT
26-09-2019T23:37:42,AspiringNoodle,Don't play?  Or cheat?
26-09-2019T23:37:44,MarvTheHugPharaoh,tell me
26-09-2019T23:37:45,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-snicker:
26-09-2019T23:37:45,w0lfmare,What is it Sage?
26-09-2019T23:37:47,BadFoMo,Kill everyone?
26-09-2019T23:37:49,Sclimshady,Kill the other team?
26-09-2019T23:37:56,LannAF,it better not be kill everyone.
26-09-2019T23:37:57,SageSaga,Grown man crying for people to not shoot him
26-09-2019T23:37:59,LannAF,LOL
26-09-2019T23:38:01,Sclimshady,XD
26-09-2019T23:38:06,w0lfmare,XD
26-09-2019T23:38:07,MarvTheHugPharaoh,learn how to spell innocent backwards?
26-09-2019T23:38:14,LannAF,lmao marv you know of it
26-09-2019T23:38:15,Sclimshady,^
26-09-2019T23:38:19,Combak,Marv: Mindcrack?
26-09-2019T23:38:23,PurpleLemons,Tneconni
26-09-2019T23:38:26,MarvTheHugPharaoh,^
26-09-2019T23:38:35,Sclimshady,Cannoli
26-09-2019T23:38:50,LannAF,I'm probably going to set karma rates really high purely to circumvent people being twits xD
26-09-2019T23:39:03,LannAF,"I want everyone to know when it starts that the point of it is to have fun, not to win"
26-09-2019T23:39:31,LannAF,I had so much fun with TTT back in the day.
26-09-2019T23:39:48,Sclimshady,Win by having the most fun.  I can have more than you
26-09-2019T23:39:51,LannAF,Gaining people's trusts and backstabbing them in the funniest ways
26-09-2019T23:39:55,RimaDraws,am i a twit
26-09-2019T23:40:02,LannAF,depends
26-09-2019T23:40:13,Sclimshady,I dont even need to ask
26-09-2019T23:40:14,LannAF,I have not witnessed your twittage in action so you are not as of yet
26-09-2019T23:40:18,RimaDraws,oh i see how it is
26-09-2019T23:40:21,LannAF,tom is the biggest twit
26-09-2019T23:40:46,LannAF,I recall a hilarious situation in TTT
26-09-2019T23:40:47,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"twittage, thats way to much fun to say"
26-09-2019T23:41:09,LannAF,"I killed a guy silently, then exclaimed ""Oh my god this guy just got killed!"" and identified his body"
26-09-2019T23:41:18,LannAF,"Someone else came in, checked the body too, and I silently killed them too"
26-09-2019T23:41:25,LannAF,"""THERE'S A SNIPER SOMEWHERE"""
26-09-2019T23:41:31,AspiringNoodle,"Oh my, I just had a horrible alliteration lined up thanks to my new word ""twittage"" xD"
26-09-2019T23:41:33,LannAF,people stream in frantically looking for a sniper
26-09-2019T23:41:34,RimaDraws,oh wow
26-09-2019T23:41:40,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
26-09-2019T23:41:49,LannAF,rinse and repeat with people alone
26-09-2019T23:41:50,SageSaga,I did that too Lann- the only difference though
26-09-2019T23:41:54,SageSaga,ive never played TTT
26-09-2019T23:41:54,AspiringNoodle,"Lann, that is EVIL"
26-09-2019T23:41:56,AspiringNoodle,And I LOVE IT
26-09-2019T23:42:05,LannAF,dude the situations you get into are hilarious
26-09-2019T23:42:06,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Sage was playing the real TTT
26-09-2019T23:42:08,Sclimshady,Sage O.O
26-09-2019T23:42:09,LannAF,sage ._.
26-09-2019T23:42:13,Ordithus,"The thing is, Lann was innocent the whole time"
26-09-2019T23:42:17,LannAF,lmao
26-09-2019T23:42:20,LannAF,hey
26-09-2019T23:42:21,Sclimshady,Lol
26-09-2019T23:42:24,LannAF,I only rdm'd sometimes
26-09-2019T23:42:28,LannAF,and only when it was funny
26-09-2019T23:42:31,LannAF,...most the time.
26-09-2019T23:42:39,RimaDraws,what is rdm'd
26-09-2019T23:42:45,LannAF,Random Death Match
26-09-2019T23:42:54,LannAF,It means to kill someone without proper proof/reasoning
26-09-2019T23:43:02,LannAF,You randomely start murdering them
26-09-2019T23:43:08,BadFoMo,"I remember Mark playing it. I think my faveret bit is when he was saying ""I'm not a Terrorest!"", killed the firest two players he saw only to be killed and find out that he killed the only other people what weren't traiters."
26-09-2019T23:43:09,MarvTheHugPharaoh,just like how swaggersouls would
26-09-2019T23:43:18,LannAF,I think my favorite tactic
26-09-2019T23:43:28,LannAF,"Was to become friends with someone, and talk in voice chat constantly with them"
26-09-2019T23:43:39,LannAF,"eventually  when we would be alone, I'd kill them but keep talking like normal"
26-09-2019T23:43:46,LannAF,And then pretend we got into a firefight
26-09-2019T23:44:01,RimaDraws,kill everyone?
26-09-2019T23:44:02,Combak,... Wouldn't the dead person go silent?
26-09-2019T23:44:03,LannAF,"So midway of me talking I'd kill them, keep walking, and then say ""oh no someone shot my friend"""
26-09-2019T23:44:11,SageSaga,"*Sage Shoot Lann* Lann - Hey! No RDM!, Me - I saw you were a terrorist on your stream so it wasnt random"
26-09-2019T23:44:15,LannAF,"no, because I woud establish that I talk a lot"
26-09-2019T23:44:23,LannAF,That's meta gaming >:L
26-09-2019T23:44:32,LannAF,see
26-09-2019T23:44:33,MarvTheHugPharaoh,pro strats there sage
26-09-2019T23:44:45,LannAF,it's believable that they don't talk if you establish that you go on long winded rants
26-09-2019T23:44:56,SageSaga,no its not Lann- you see- the character im playing has the ability to see into your past and only your past
26-09-2019T23:45:01,Sclimshady,The long con
26-09-2019T23:45:05,LannAF,THAT'S NOT HOW THIS WORKS.
26-09-2019T23:45:09,LannAF,Yeah sclim
26-09-2019T23:45:16,LannAF,Nowadays most people play to kill everyone asap
26-09-2019T23:45:31,Sclimshady,"Aww, thats no fun"
26-09-2019T23:45:35,LannAF,which isn't nearly as fun as just goofing off and making uneasy alliances which may or may not end in a heaping load of bodies
26-09-2019T23:45:54,LannAF,Another hilarious thing to do is when there's only one innocent left
26-09-2019T23:46:02,LannAF,"They're asking ""h-hello? Is anyone else still alive?"""
26-09-2019T23:46:18,Ordithus,"I'm gonna get some sleep.  Thanks for the streams, nice work Purp, Sage, Tom!  Goodnight!"
26-09-2019T23:46:18,LannAF,and they walk into the room you've hung all the corpses of literally everyone else in the server to the ceiling
26-09-2019T23:46:23,LannAF,Goodnight Ordithus!
26-09-2019T23:46:26,MarvTheHugPharaoh,nighty night Ord <3
26-09-2019T23:46:26,SageSaga,night Ord!
26-09-2019T23:46:28,AnuSekaniArt,Night Ord!
26-09-2019T23:46:34,Sclimshady,Night Ord o/
26-09-2019T23:46:51,LannAF,"It's a great experience, being on both ends of that situation"
26-09-2019T23:47:30,LannAF,Games of deception are fantastic but you -need- to play with the right people otherwise you lose out on a lot of fun.
26-09-2019T23:47:34,Combak,And being the spectators watching either person.
26-09-2019T23:47:42,LannAF,TTT is drastically less fun with less people too
26-09-2019T23:47:45,LannAF,dude yes
26-09-2019T23:48:11,LannAF,Spectating is a fricking heck of a time when things get intense or goofy
26-09-2019T23:48:28,Sclimshady,Night everyone.  Awesome art all around :heart:
26-09-2019T23:48:34,LannAF,Goodnight Sclim

26-09-2019T23:52:18,BadFoMo,...That may have sounded better in my head.
26-09-2019T23:52:27,Combak,"Nah, it works."
26-09-2019T23:52:35,Combak,"Also, I think you mean panel 6?"
26-09-2019T23:52:50,BadFoMo,"Yeah, 6."

26-09-2019T23:56:26,LannAF,don't be afraid to lose them
26-09-2019T23:56:29,BadFoMo,Maybe?
26-09-2019T23:56:33,LannAF,I can get them back easily.

26-09-2019T23:58:50,Combak,Because I've been here less than an hour?
26-09-2019T23:59:03,SageSaga,Want to post a link? So long as the link is SFW you can post it IF you first describe what the link is of and then post the link. If your description of the link is incorrect- you will be banned for abusing the system. So make sure you have the right link
26-09-2019T23:59:17,SageSaga,you are not new here Combak!
26-09-2019T23:59:36,BadFoMo,I thought it was nice to ask first.
