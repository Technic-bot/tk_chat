08-01-2019T00:05:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Lots of cosplays
08-01-2019T00:05:47,SpazztasticKiwi,She and her new husband just filmed a viking short
08-01-2019T00:06:05,Twokinds,that sounds fun
08-01-2019T00:06:23,unsteddyphoenix,Fun couple activity
08-01-2019T00:06:50,SpazztasticKiwi,And it’s really good too
08-01-2019T00:06:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Fake blood and everything
08-01-2019T00:07:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Husband also does sooo much Captain Jack Sparrow cosplay and of course they both do plenty of Star Wars work
08-01-2019T00:08:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I need to visit her
08-01-2019T00:08:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Bad

08-01-2019T00:27:33,unsteddyphoenix,Second best way to do it
08-01-2019T00:27:53,unsteddyphoenix,Number one is of course a viking axe
08-01-2019T00:28:08,unsteddyphoenix,But they sound amazing
08-01-2019T00:28:57,SpazztasticKiwi,My dads side. Of course they’re crazy cool
08-01-2019T00:30:30,SpazztasticKiwi,My moms side does robotics and craft stuff and fancy things too
08-01-2019T00:31:12,SpazztasticKiwi,But it’s my dads sisters who had kids close to what I nosedive into
08-01-2019T00:34:38,unsteddyphoenix,To what you somersault into
08-01-2019T00:39:49,SpazztasticKiwi,I can only nosedive. I am not athletic

08-01-2019T16:14:15,CrimsonQuill,Question
08-01-2019T16:14:33,CrimsonQuill,Have any of you ever heard about a regiment known as the South Irish Horse
08-01-2019T16:17:28,TerraTheWizard,nope
08-01-2019T16:22:09,Twokinds,Yes
08-01-2019T16:22:23,CrimsonQuill,"Really, Tom?"
08-01-2019T16:22:32,CrimsonQuill,You have?
08-01-2019T16:22:36,Twokinds,Yes. Someone on Picarto mentioned it a few minutes ago.
08-01-2019T16:22:47,CrimsonQuill,"Oh, haha."

08-01-2019T16:24:24,CrimsonQuill,"But anyhow, they're an actually rather unknown regiment, who fought during World War 1."
08-01-2019T16:24:34,CrimsonQuill,My father did a lot of research on them.
08-01-2019T16:24:41,CrimsonQuill,He's written a book.
08-01-2019T16:24:59,CrimsonQuill,They were an Irish Cavalry regiment.
08-01-2019T16:26:40,CrimsonQuill,Not much information is given about them in most books.
08-01-2019T16:26:56,CrimsonQuill,So my father decided that their story needed to be told.
08-01-2019T16:27:09,CrimsonQuill,And I'm reading the book right now.

08-01-2019T18:49:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Should be able to go at 10. Breads done so all we’s got is close stuff
08-01-2019T18:49:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Provided the church crowd is low
08-01-2019T18:49:41,SpazztasticKiwi,✌🏻
08-01-2019T19:03:03,Dadrobit,Done for the day myself.
08-01-2019T19:04:47,CommanderTrace,are you guys have instagram?
08-01-2019T19:05:10,Dadrobit,Had a lot of private religious academies today. Ironically had to patiently sit through a nun lecturing me about the trials of Job.
08-01-2019T19:10:04,unsteddyphoenix,"Sorry, a lot of acadamies?"
08-01-2019T19:10:43,Dadrobit,Private religious schools in an upper crust area.
08-01-2019T19:11:21,unsteddyphoenix,Hm.
08-01-2019T19:11:25,unsteddyphoenix,Did you learn from the nun?
08-01-2019T19:11:59,Dadrobit,"Not really, read the bible a few times. But the nun ~insisted~ I stay and learn with the students for ""just a moment""."
08-01-2019T19:12:45,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
08-01-2019T19:12:52,unsteddyphoenix,Hey your soul can still be saved
08-01-2019T19:13:00,unsteddyphoenix,Wait arent you jewish?
08-01-2019T19:13:11,Dadrobit,Used to be Jewish. I got better.
08-01-2019T19:13:49,unsteddyphoenix,Understandable have a nice barmitzvah
08-01-2019T19:13:49,Dadrobit,"If I were to ever follow a dogma again I think, it'd have to be Buddhism."
08-01-2019T19:14:15,Dadrobit,But alas. I am content being a listless heathen.
08-01-2019T19:14:18,unsteddyphoenix,seems like a fairly chill dogma
08-01-2019T19:15:03,Dadrobit,"Yeah, the eight-fold path is a pretty legit ideology."
08-01-2019T19:45:39,RimaDraws,Home from my workout
08-01-2019T21:06:07,Dadrobit,Holy shitballs. Looking up my route for tomorrow. First two deliveries is gonna be over 100 miles.
08-01-2019T21:06:58,Dadrobit,Northwest 38 miles. Then Southeast 74 miles
08-01-2019T21:11:20,Twokinds,:O
08-01-2019T21:11:27,Twokinds,That sounds like a lot.
08-01-2019T21:12:38,Dadrobit,No single day on the job thus far has been more than 90 miles.
08-01-2019T21:14:09,Dadrobit,That 112 mile stretch is just going to be my first two hours or so.
08-01-2019T21:14:26,Dadrobit,Then luckily everything after that is within about 15 miles of each other.
08-01-2019T21:15:29,Dadrobit,"Fortunately, I make bonus money by the mile. Not a ton, but it covers gas and then some."
08-01-2019T21:24:34,Twokinds,Are you doing delivery stuff?
08-01-2019T21:25:39,Mippy,Just learned some illustrator basics...like shortcuts and stuff. Be making the digital arts in no time. :ctwokinds-soon:
08-01-2019T21:36:51,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I'm working as a courier for the company my sister works at."
08-01-2019T21:37:05,Dadrobit,"$15 an hour, plus $.35 per mile."
08-01-2019T21:38:11,Dadrobit,Mostly easy work. Just have to deliver a few thousand flyers to a buncha schools around the state.
08-01-2019T21:38:34,Dadrobit,"Some poor sod has to go all the way to Yuma, (essentially Mexico/California)"
08-01-2019T21:39:07,Dadrobit,220 miles from the office.
08-01-2019T21:39:12,RimaDraws,oh boy
08-01-2019T21:39:54,Dadrobit,"Sorry, 210. Not 220."
08-01-2019T21:39:55,Twokinds,"I hate to drive, so that'd definitely not be a job for me."
08-01-2019T21:41:24,Dadrobit,"Put the cruise control on 75, load a couple CD's, and jam out all the way there."
08-01-2019T21:41:56,unsteddyphoenix,Unless youre bad at driving like me
08-01-2019T21:42:06,unsteddyphoenix,Then you spend the whole time anxious~
08-01-2019T21:42:06,Dadrobit,Free money as far as I'm concerned.
08-01-2019T21:42:22,RimaDraws,ah
08-01-2019T21:43:41,Dadrobit,"... I feel like I should know this, but what side of the street is the side you drive on in NZ? I know AUS is on the left."
08-01-2019T21:43:48,Dadrobit,But you aren't them.
08-01-2019T21:44:11,unsteddyphoenix,I appreciate the distinction
08-01-2019T21:44:26,unsteddyphoenix,"But we are both still colonies of the glorious british empire, so the left as well"
08-01-2019T21:45:12,Dadrobit,Canada is still a part of the UK and they drive on the right though.
08-01-2019T21:45:35,Dadrobit,(Kind of)
08-01-2019T21:45:53,Dadrobit,At least they still recognize the Queen I think.
08-01-2019T21:46:14,RimaDraws,you live in canada dadro?
08-01-2019T21:46:22,unsteddyphoenix,Imagine the disaster americans driving into canada or vice versa would have though :thinking:
08-01-2019T21:46:26,Dadrobit,"Nah, Canadians tend to live with us though."
08-01-2019T21:46:46,unsteddyphoenix,Probably a matter of convinience
08-01-2019T21:47:15,Dadrobit,I do love me some Canadian money though.
08-01-2019T21:47:26,unsteddyphoenix,its like pink and purple right?
08-01-2019T21:47:41,Dadrobit,Every winter they migrate down here and give us all their money.
08-01-2019T21:48:00,unsteddyphoenix,how generous!
08-01-2019T21:48:22,RimaDraws,oh wow
08-01-2019T21:48:50,Dadrobit,Only time my French education ever came in handy. Working with the French Canadians.
08-01-2019T21:49:47,Dadrobit,"Alas, they drive like shit. So that does kinda suck."
08-01-2019T21:50:17,Dadrobit,"""Speed limit is 65 and the flow is going at 80? Better hog the fast lane and do 50!"""
08-01-2019T21:53:30,unsteddyphoenix,"That does fit with their ""relaxed"" image"
08-01-2019T21:53:55,Dadrobit,But... But... Mah speed!
08-01-2019T21:54:17,unsteddyphoenix,Aaand that fits with the american image
08-01-2019T21:54:25,Dadrobit,It's a way of life here.
08-01-2019T21:54:55,unsteddyphoenix,Gotta go F A S T :race_car:
08-01-2019T21:55:03,Dadrobit,Specifically in central AZ. We used to have speed cameras on the freeways. But they eventually got taken down.
08-01-2019T21:55:32,Dadrobit,"Like, within two years."
08-01-2019T21:55:53,Dadrobit,"Literally everyone was getting tickets for speeding, but no one was paying."
08-01-2019T21:56:12,Dadrobit,Then one of their maintenance people got shot in a drive-by.
08-01-2019T21:56:39,Dadrobit,So they decided it was just better to let folks do whatever on the freeways.
08-01-2019T21:57:42,Dadrobit,They're still on the surface streets though. So there the limits are actually enforced.
08-01-2019T21:58:12,Dadrobit,But the freeways are kinda whatever. So long as you're not driving like an asshole you're good to go.
08-01-2019T21:58:39,Dadrobit,Best story I have was getting a warning for doing 120.
08-01-2019T21:59:09,Dadrobit,193 kph for you non-freedom units folks.
08-01-2019T22:00:22,Dadrobit,"It was 4 in the morning and it was my older brother and I going out paintballing. The cop just let us go saying to slow it down, and wishing he could go with us."
08-01-2019T22:01:30,unsteddyphoenix,So the freeway is like
08-01-2019T22:01:35,unsteddyphoenix,A lawless zone
08-01-2019T22:01:53,unsteddyphoenix,Its more dangerous to try stop the drivers so the cops dont try
08-01-2019T22:02:54,Dadrobit,"Nah, there are still cops and sheriffs. And they'll pull you over for being too aggressive. But traffic just generally flows at around 75-85. Normally that's a hefty ticket in other parts of the states."
08-01-2019T22:03:36,Dadrobit,"speed ""limit"" is 65."
08-01-2019T22:05:36,unsteddyphoenix,If the cops have to fill a ticket quota do they just pull over random people?
08-01-2019T22:06:42,Dadrobit,ticket quotas are a myth. Jsut sayin'.
08-01-2019T22:06:49,Dadrobit,Just*
08-01-2019T22:07:08,Dadrobit,"And no, there are still plenty of assholes doing asshole things getting pulled over."
08-01-2019T22:08:07,Dadrobit,Doing 80 is fine. Doing 80 while dodging between multiple lanes of traffic is fine-able.
08-01-2019T22:13:23,unsteddyphoenix,What if you do it while blasting eurobeat
08-01-2019T22:13:31,unsteddyphoenix,And doing sick drifts
08-01-2019T22:20:12,Dadrobit,eurobeat alone is a jailable offense.
08-01-2019T22:20:22,Dadrobit,Or at least I hope it is.
08-01-2019T22:21:05,unsteddyphoenix,Dejavu~
08-01-2019T22:23:04,Bgrmystr2,I've been in this place before~ :notes:
08-01-2019T22:23:37,Dadrobit,And with that. I need to head to bed. Gotta get up early for a long drive tomorrow lol.
08-01-2019T22:24:02,Dadrobit,"Likely accompanied by Pink Floyd, Metallica, and Tool."
08-01-2019T22:24:21,Dadrobit,Because I'm a normal person.
08-01-2019T22:24:29,unsteddyphoenix,Mhm~ night dad
08-01-2019T22:24:34,unsteddyphoenix,Learn to swim

08-01-2019T22:25:31,Dadrobit,<3 <3

08-01-2019T22:38:03,Bgrmystr2,So I just finished putting together a computer w/ couple of friends
08-01-2019T22:38:22,Bgrmystr2,"his mobo or cpu went out, not sure which, so we just replaced it with a new ryzen 2000 series"
08-01-2019T22:43:21,RimaDraws,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/453664824413650953/532766236023717908/rima1.png  @Twokinds wip of one of my characters in the upcoming comic

08-01-2019T22:43:58,RimaDraws,i still need to make a few facial expressions then color it

08-01-2019T22:47:47,RimaDraws,ty

08-01-2019T22:51:31,RimaDraws,Rimara is actually from germany
08-01-2019T22:52:56,RimaDraws,this story is far more than just her life in school it goes much further. i got the plot but i need to write it out
08-01-2019T22:54:18,unsteddyphoenix,Thats cool. I like watching characters age
08-01-2019T22:54:51,unsteddyphoenix,Makes development a lor smoother imo
08-01-2019T22:55:00,unsteddyphoenix,Instead of a bunch of things happening to them in a few weeks
08-01-2019T22:55:02,RimaDraws,this does go through her adolescence and adult life learning about past life secrets. involves some greek mythology for those interested
08-01-2019T22:59:25,unsteddyphoenix,Is she a daughter of zues?
08-01-2019T22:59:40,RimaDraws,no spoilers but yes
08-01-2019T22:59:50,RimaDraws,past life goddess but i wont say who
08-01-2019T23:02:38,unsteddyphoenix,Gotcha
08-01-2019T23:04:16,RimaDraws,mhm
08-01-2019T23:08:36,RimaDraws,sorry i am self conscious when it comes to revealing my ideas
08-01-2019T23:12:48,unsteddyphoenix,I think thats pretty common
08-01-2019T23:15:41,RimaDraws,yea i just dont like revealing them much like my sketch ideas
08-01-2019T23:21:46,SpazztasticKiwi,I feel
08-01-2019T23:22:12,SpazztasticKiwi,I have so many separate spin off ideas and no idea where they’re going let alone if I’ll finish them
08-01-2019T23:22:30,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s ridiculous
08-01-2019T23:23:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"Overheard in checkout line: guy 1 “bro, does that peanut butter have nuts in it?”"
08-01-2019T23:23:27,SpazztasticKiwi,guy 2 “nah man”
08-01-2019T23:23:49,SpazztasticKiwi,I hope nobody dies tonight
08-01-2019T23:25:31,RimaDraws,lol
08-01-2019T23:26:07,unsteddyphoenix,But does it have butter :thinking:
08-01-2019T23:26:18,Bgrmystr2,I mean..
08-01-2019T23:26:27,Bgrmystr2,peanut butter is literally ground peanuts
08-01-2019T23:26:31,Bgrmystr2,so..
08-01-2019T23:26:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’m afraid if I asked em that, they’d say yes"
08-01-2019T23:26:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Also I’d prefer not to talk to them at all
08-01-2019T23:27:04,SpazztasticKiwi,They smell heavily of cologne
08-01-2019T23:31:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Now I got to drive home in the cold
08-01-2019T23:46:17,SpazztasticKiwi,🏠
