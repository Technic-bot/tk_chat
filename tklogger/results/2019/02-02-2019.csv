02-02-2019T16:31:09,CrimsonQuill,I binged the entire Freelancer saga today.
02-02-2019T16:31:16,CrimsonQuill,"Tomorrow, the Chorus Trilogy!"
02-02-2019T16:31:24,ShadowSoap,o.O
02-02-2019T16:31:36,BadFoMo,I need to catch up on RvB.
02-02-2019T16:31:41,CrimsonQuill,"I tried Cowboy Bebop, but Crunchyroll and Funimation no longer have the dub... :ptv-grossedout:"
02-02-2019T16:31:55,CrimsonQuill,So I resorted to RvB instead.
02-02-2019T16:31:56,MrMongMong,What about... ONE PUUUUUUNCH!
02-02-2019T16:32:04,MrMongMong,Or Aggretsuko?

02-02-2019T16:32:45,MrMongMong,I would really reccomend Aggretsuko though. It's really good.
02-02-2019T16:32:52,TorqueEmUp,"""Goodbye industrious little fellows!"""
02-02-2019T16:32:54,CrimsonQuill,I'll add it to the list.
02-02-2019T16:32:55,MrMongMong,And everyone loves Haida.
02-02-2019T16:33:09,CrimsonQuill,The Ancient Magus' Bride is excellent.
02-02-2019T16:33:17,CrimsonQuill,And so is Yuri!!! On ice.
02-02-2019T16:33:19,Bgrmystr2,I'm not big on Aggretsuko
02-02-2019T16:33:31,CrimsonQuill,And Mob Psycho 100...I'll watch the new season of that
02-02-2019T16:33:34,ThingsAreMoving,Aggretsuko is like lucky star
02-02-2019T16:33:40,ThingsAreMoving,you have to like it to watch it
02-02-2019T16:33:53,Bgrmystr2,"well, Lucky star has a lot of things going for it"
02-02-2019T16:33:55,RimaDraws,i like it but its very extravagant
02-02-2019T16:34:06,Bgrmystr2,Aggretsuko really didn't for me.
02-02-2019T16:34:13,ThingsAreMoving,I tried getting into it three times
02-02-2019T16:34:34,ThingsAreMoving,couldn't get past third or forth ep
02-02-2019T16:34:51,RimaDraws,i watched all 11 eps
02-02-2019T16:34:53,Bgrmystr2,the first 5 episodes are made from a different director than the rest of the series
02-02-2019T16:35:22,ThingsAreMoving,I prefer stuff like Utawarerumono
02-02-2019T16:35:27,Bgrmystr2,lucky star has 24 episodes lel

02-02-2019T16:36:28,Bgrmystr2,so that's not surprising
02-02-2019T16:37:34,DanielXD,So what are u guys up to?
02-02-2019T16:37:34,ThingsAreMoving,Nowadays I don't have time to watch anime anyway.
02-02-2019T16:37:40,ThingsAreMoving,I just read the manga
02-02-2019T16:37:43,Bgrmystr2,stuff like Lucky Star partially require you to either appreciate or at least understand the everyday life of school in japan
02-02-2019T16:38:09,Bgrmystr2,"it's really specific, but good for those who experienced it.. IE all of japan xD"
02-02-2019T16:38:09,ThingsAreMoving,"Yup, that's the problem. Too much RL in my anime kills it for me"
02-02-2019T16:38:29,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Thats way FairyTail is best \o/
02-02-2019T16:38:40,Bgrmystr2,"you're prolly not looking at anime for slice of life then, you want some kind of fantasy or whatnot"

02-02-2019T20:14:18,ThingsAreMoving,or OBS doin a crazy

02-02-2019T23:05:17,Dadrobit,"Working as a cashier for three years, the number of sideways glances and blushes I've seen from kids buying condoms has made me numb to it lol."
02-02-2019T23:05:18,Bgrmystr2,at the end of the stream
02-02-2019T23:05:32,BluePhantom90,Reni has Kei and Nora has Trace
02-02-2019T23:05:54,Dadrobit,Was it at the end end? I left during the 4th or 5th sketch?
02-02-2019T23:06:08,Ordithus,"Yeah, he mentioned it at the end"

02-02-2019T23:06:21,unsteddyphoenix,Rumour has it that yours is getting drawn dad
02-02-2019T23:06:23,Ordithus,He didn't finish #5 quite
02-02-2019T23:06:31,unsteddyphoenix,But you didn't hear it from me
02-02-2019T23:06:33,RimaDraws,i had an awkward situation about a 17 year old asking me about condoms once
02-02-2019T23:06:44,Ordithus,Though he did say your complaining made him tempted to not sketch it
02-02-2019T23:06:54,Dadrobit,I was there for that lol
02-02-2019T23:07:39,Dadrobit,"Being an annoying asshole is kind of a defining trait of mine, so I understand."
02-02-2019T23:08:00,BluePhantom90,"that would be funny as hell! Has anyone seen ""Dragon Pilot"" anime on Netflix yet?"
02-02-2019T23:08:56,Ordithus,nope
02-02-2019T23:09:07,RimaDraws,you are not annoying dadro
02-02-2019T23:09:16,Dadrobit,"Awwww, thanks Rima"

02-02-2019T23:10:02,Dadrobit,"Naw, I've been annoying Tom for years and years now."
02-02-2019T23:10:07,unsteddyphoenix,I'm the leastest annoying   :D

02-02-2019T23:10:54,Ordithus,I am only moderately annoying
02-02-2019T23:11:55,Dadrobit,I do sometimes wonder if he takes it seriously or not though? Poe's Law and all that.
02-02-2019T23:12:43,ZahnHolley,"im afraid to ask, did tom do sketches or a comic? Im sorry, I wasnt around when he started."
02-02-2019T23:12:50,Ordithus,Sketches

02-02-2019T23:56:19,Twokinds,There must have been a period of time when I just wanted in the habit of mirroring Patreon color art to dA
02-02-2019T23:56:56,Twokinds,I guess that's one good thing about Patreon's shenanigans. It got me to pay more attention to mirroring the color art.
02-02-2019T23:57:48,RimaDraws,they all look great ^^
02-02-2019T23:58:07,Twokinds,lol thanks
