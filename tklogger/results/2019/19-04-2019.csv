19-04-2019T00:01:14,Twokinds,"I did, but weirdly I like it better uncolored"

19-04-2019T00:01:51,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
19-04-2019T00:02:09,Twokinds,I think it's just that uncolored it looks more like a diagram

19-04-2019T00:02:12,FoxxTrotter,"I'm off to bed. G'night, everyone. :0)"

19-04-2019T00:07:56,unsteddyphoenix,Final boss/10
19-04-2019T00:08:57,Sclimshady,10/10 would get stuck on final boss for hours
19-04-2019T00:09:34,unsteddyphoenix,Those glowy blue mushrooms are reminding me of something...
19-04-2019T00:09:41,unsteddyphoenix,Like theyre from a game
19-04-2019T00:09:58,CrimsonHelsing,I'm kind of split between fallout and skyrim on that
19-04-2019T00:09:59,Bgrmystr2,needs a good boss theme
19-04-2019T00:11:32,PositivePizza,I'm getting bloodborne vibes
19-04-2019T00:11:34,Twokinds,Hollow Knight?
19-04-2019T00:11:42,Twokinds,because that's the game I was thinking of when I drew them
19-04-2019T00:11:56,PurpleLemons,that rose piece is coming out nicely :clap:
19-04-2019T00:12:36,unsteddyphoenix,Hmm no but I heard that games amazing
19-04-2019T00:12:49,Combak,It is.
19-04-2019T00:12:59,Combak,I can see the Fungal Wastes influence.
19-04-2019T00:13:30,Combak,That way the blue contrasts so strongly with the red is a great bonus too.
19-04-2019T00:13:41,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
19-04-2019T00:13:41,Combak,"LOL, repairman Keith."
19-04-2019T00:13:42,unsteddyphoenix,lmao
19-04-2019T00:13:52,unsteddyphoenix,"Ok, this is already fantastic"
19-04-2019T00:13:54,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Keith ""Dude I need the shirt."""
19-04-2019T00:13:59,thestooge2222,oh that's nice of kieth holding Natani's bags!
19-04-2019T00:14:08,RimaDraws,lol
19-04-2019T00:16:19,unsteddyphoenix,"Is it ""Im here to lay some pipes"" plumber Keith or ""Honey im home"" businessman who's been working a lot of overtime lately Keith\"
19-04-2019T00:18:06,RimaDraws,hm
19-04-2019T00:18:29,Zakuru,turning this into a shopping day huh
19-04-2019T00:18:58,Mutterwolf,I'm going to have to buy the collected story books.  Your work has developed so much over the course of the stories.
19-04-2019T00:19:04,Sclimshady,katana tail ftw
19-04-2019T00:19:40,PositivePizza,I wonder what kind of thing would make Keith eye's look like everyone else's eyes.
19-04-2019T00:19:48,thestooge2222,Is it weird that I always pronounce Natani's name as (Nah-teni) in my head?
19-04-2019T00:20:38,Twokinds,Yes
19-04-2019T00:21:02,thestooge2222,I'll try to correct that
19-04-2019T00:21:36,Bgrmystr2,yeah it's Ntni
19-04-2019T00:21:45,Twokinds,"You know, Keith doesn't really have a lot of passions"
19-04-2019T00:21:45,Bgrmystr2,gotta be extra perfect
19-04-2019T00:21:51,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I always just called her Toby
19-04-2019T00:21:56,Twokinds,I was trying to think of something that would make him get really excited
19-04-2019T00:21:58,Zakuru,no surprise there
19-04-2019T00:22:06,RimaDraws,i sometimes call her tani
19-04-2019T00:22:08,unsteddyphoenix,Years of full on depression will do that to a cabbit :T
19-04-2019T00:22:09,Twokinds,"(you know, other than Natani XD)"
19-04-2019T00:22:19,Twokinds,But he doesn't really have any hobbies or interests
19-04-2019T00:22:26,RimaDraws,thats sad
19-04-2019T00:22:29,Combak,Time to give him some?
19-04-2019T00:22:37,PositivePizza,Lol
19-04-2019T00:22:38,thestooge2222,Kat should introduce him to some
19-04-2019T00:22:39,Zakuru,relatable tom
19-04-2019T00:22:40,unsteddyphoenix,"Now that he's less miserable, he can learn some~"
19-04-2019T00:22:43,Zakuru,i have a couple ocs like that
19-04-2019T00:22:49,Combak,"Or is it a case of ""they got tossed aside for other stuff."""
19-04-2019T00:22:53,Sclimshady,what more does he need besides Natani
19-04-2019T00:23:14,CrimsonHelsing,what about carving?
19-04-2019T00:23:16,Twokinds,Flora has food. That makes her eyes go big
19-04-2019T00:23:16,unsteddyphoenix,For some reason carpentry comes to mind
19-04-2019T00:23:27,Twokinds,But I can't imagine Keith getting big eyes for... anything
19-04-2019T00:23:30,Voxis,he could collect stamps
19-04-2019T00:23:40,Mutterwolf,Yeah Crimson - I thught carving too
19-04-2019T00:23:50,unsteddyphoenix,"Mayve he;s just, chill"
19-04-2019T00:24:05,Combak,Tom: Combat? Martial arts?
19-04-2019T00:24:10,Zakuru,time to go backwards om
19-04-2019T00:24:12,Zakuru,*tom
19-04-2019T00:24:19,PositivePizza,Keith is honestly a mood
19-04-2019T00:24:26,Sclimshady,"plot twist, he presses flowers"
19-04-2019T00:24:40,unsteddyphoenix,Heh
19-04-2019T00:24:43,Zakuru,thats cute
19-04-2019T00:24:48,unsteddyphoenix,Something he learnt from the fox villiage
19-04-2019T00:25:03,unsteddyphoenix,He secretly loves kittens and babies
19-04-2019T00:25:15,Combak,"I mean, Keith and Nat did initially bond over sparring... right?"
19-04-2019T00:25:15,Zakuru,or his childhood with alaric
19-04-2019T00:25:18,BowlOfSomething,"Uh, what's happening on this image exactly?"
19-04-2019T00:25:28,Sclimshady,im pretty sure he would prefer cubs
19-04-2019T00:25:41,Sclimshady,wink wink
19-04-2019T00:25:51,unsteddyphoenix,I dont get it

19-04-2019T00:26:08,CrimsonHelsing,"not necessarily a hobby, but I can see Keith enjoying sightseeing from time to time for some reason"

19-04-2019T00:26:55,TheOtherEric,Just throwing this out there. Nat's eyes looks extra cute today
19-04-2019T00:27:01,Twokinds,Shopping day. Natani is trying out outfits and asking Keith's opinion.
19-04-2019T00:27:03,Bgrmystr2,lol how do you forget xD

19-04-2019T00:27:22,unsteddyphoenix,Natani thats not an outfit.

19-04-2019T00:27:38,Zakuru,you have to finishing putting on the clothes
19-04-2019T00:27:39,Combak,"It's something about a katana, based on the google results."
19-04-2019T00:27:41,RimaDraws,just that being on is fine. she dont need pants
19-04-2019T00:28:12,unsteddyphoenix,Her tie's not even done right?
19-04-2019T00:28:17,unsteddyphoenix,Jeez Natani.

19-04-2019T00:28:31,CrimsonHelsing,it don't need to be finished in this case
19-04-2019T00:28:38,RimaDraws,^
19-04-2019T00:28:40,Sclimshady,what kind of man cant even properly tie a tie
19-04-2019T00:28:51,Combak,"Also, Tom, you know what you're going to see in the Sunday suggestion, right? ""Keith engaged in one of his hobbies with Natani."""
19-04-2019T00:29:06,RimaDraws,i know how to tie a tie. i love wearing them

19-04-2019T00:31:03,BowlOfSomething,That could kinda count as a hobby

19-04-2019T00:34:38,PositivePizza,Remembering Keith throughout the comic he pretty much only focused on getting back home the whole time after... Stuff
19-04-2019T00:34:58,TheOtherEric,"Yeah, and theres already tons of Kieth x Nat fighting drawings, isnt there?"
19-04-2019T00:35:05,RimaDraws,mhmm

19-04-2019T00:36:41,CrimsonHelsing,"never really found time for hobbies, I would gather from all he's been through. Unless there's something that's been left out during the time he was with the coastal foxes"

19-04-2019T00:43:55,Sclimshady,killin
19-04-2019T00:44:19,TheOtherEric,Expand leg
19-04-2019T00:44:56,PositivePizza,Ain't killin her job tho
19-04-2019T00:45:24,Sclimshady,if you love what you do yuo never work a day in your life
19-04-2019T00:45:35,SageSaga,bullcrap
19-04-2019T00:46:04,PositivePizza,Understandable
19-04-2019T00:46:19,Bgrmystr2,I'd say it's highly dependant on what you like to do.
19-04-2019T00:46:48,Combak,"Well, it's super late now."
19-04-2019T00:46:54,Combak,Night all!
19-04-2019T00:47:00,Sclimshady,if you love art then its double true
19-04-2019T00:47:02,Bgrmystr2,gnight combak
19-04-2019T00:47:04,Mihari,"I used to love what I do, then it became too much work and now I hate it."
19-04-2019T00:47:04,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nighty night combak
19-04-2019T00:47:09,Sclimshady,night combak
19-04-2019T00:47:43,SageSaga,I love art- I do it all the time- but saying its not work is retarded regardless of your train of thought
19-04-2019T00:48:07,Combak,"Thanks Bgr, Marv, Shady"
19-04-2019T00:48:22,Sclimshady,im joking about it being hard to find work as an artist
19-04-2019T00:48:23,Combak,See ya!
19-04-2019T00:48:38,Bgrmystr2,"most people consider ""work"" as going and doing something they don't like to do to make money."
19-04-2019T00:48:50,SageSaga,bullcrap
19-04-2019T00:49:08,Bgrmystr2,"It isn't, that's how work is seen"
19-04-2019T00:49:14,Bgrmystr2,that's the whole reason that saying exists
19-04-2019T00:49:36,Mihari,"Well that's not true either, I fully believe you can enjoy the work you do."
19-04-2019T00:49:38,Mihari,Some even do love it.
19-04-2019T00:49:52,RimaDraws,hell i work at a bottling plant and love it and its not my passion.
19-04-2019T00:50:00,Mutterwolf,"Natani would study combat styles, weapons and magic...always out to prove something.  Isolated aside from the link. Think how awkward  social interaction is unless it is applied stuff with Natani"
19-04-2019T00:50:13,Sclimshady,"i love my job, but luckily i rarely get to do it"
19-04-2019T00:50:37,Bgrmystr2,"that's the idea though. If you love what you do, you don't really consider it work. Because it's actively enjoyable to just.. do."
19-04-2019T00:50:51,SageSaga,you can love your work as much as you want- it doesnt mean its not work- people use that saying to make it seem like if you like what you do then you have it made- you dont work
19-04-2019T00:50:55,RimaDraws,i love art but i consider it a job
19-04-2019T00:51:02,CrimsonQuill,mornin'
19-04-2019T00:51:06,CrimsonQuill,o/
19-04-2019T00:51:19,PositivePizza,That statement can vary
19-04-2019T00:51:26,Sclimshady,morning crimson.
19-04-2019T00:51:34,Mutterwolf,Once it becomes work it changes from the pure loves of doing it.
19-04-2019T00:51:34,CrimsonQuill,just got up
19-04-2019T00:51:40,CrimsonHelsing,morning quill
19-04-2019T00:51:44,RimaDraws,not true either
19-04-2019T00:51:44,CrimsonQuill,:)
19-04-2019T00:51:55,SageSaga,if work was defined as doing something you dont like for money -then that would be the definition- but it isn't
19-04-2019T00:51:58,RimaDraws,when it becomes work you can still love it as it is
19-04-2019T00:52:06,Sclimshady,im a medic so i prefer not to do my job even though i enjoy it
19-04-2019T00:52:07,CrimsonHelsing,^
19-04-2019T00:52:22,CrimsonQuill,What conversation have I stumbled into?
19-04-2019T00:52:24,CrimsonHelsing,whoops that was meant to point at Rima's comment
19-04-2019T00:53:05,RimaDraws,the point is art is still a job. its not like we wave a magic wand and its done. no its a job to do and whether it is a job or its a hobby its still work and it can be enjoyed so long as you love doing it for you
19-04-2019T00:53:41,CrimsonHelsing,sometimes a job and a passion can be one and the same in several cases
19-04-2019T00:53:42,CrimsonQuill,Oh. True that.
19-04-2019T00:53:54,CrimsonQuill,"Well, I have art as a hobby"
19-04-2019T00:54:02,Bgrmystr2,"it's not made to be taken literal, sage. 'Work' is defined as putting forth effort. If you enjoy something to the point where you don't even notice effort going into it to do it, then it can't really be called work."
19-04-2019T00:54:05,CrimsonQuill,Because at the moment I am hoping to work as a surveyor...
19-04-2019T00:54:13,CrimsonQuill,Just the maths to take care of.
19-04-2019T00:54:38,CrimsonQuill,But it'd be nice to be able to draw a sci fi comic in my free time...
19-04-2019T00:55:20,Bgrmystr2,"That doesn't mean it isn't a legitimate job to make money, but work is all a matter of perspective."
19-04-2019T00:55:27,Twokinds,:saxophone::ctwokinds-nibsdance:
19-04-2019T00:55:31,SageSaga,yeah well did you have a boss who told you that when telling you he was cutting your hours?
19-04-2019T00:55:32,CrimsonQuill,Hullo Tom!
19-04-2019T00:55:33,CrimsonQuill,Doot
19-04-2019T00:55:38,CrimsonQuill,Hi Sage
19-04-2019T00:55:41,Bgrmystr2,:saxophone::ptv-excited:
19-04-2019T00:55:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:saxophone::cmarvthehugpharaoh-Yato:
19-04-2019T00:55:45,Sclimshady,:saxophone::ctwokinds-nibsdance:
19-04-2019T00:56:09,RimaDraws,ive had that happen to me sage.
19-04-2019T00:56:16,Bgrmystr2,"I've had hours cut before, I've had pay held from me because ""I didn't deserve it"""
19-04-2019T00:56:57,Bgrmystr2,yeah I know very much so.
19-04-2019T00:57:07,PositivePizza,Conversations aside this song is pretty funky
19-04-2019T00:58:19,SageSaga,then dont defend a stupid saying used to undermine peoples effort
19-04-2019T00:59:03,Bgrmystr2,"I have never heard it used that way, and I don't think that was ever the intent of the saying to begin with."
19-04-2019T00:59:10,Sclimshady,i feel really bad for making a joke about this now. im sorry sage
19-04-2019T01:00:37,BluePhantom90,You all know those re-usable bags can spread germs being used over and over. Unless you wash it over and over before use
19-04-2019T01:00:47,SageSaga,i dont care bout it too much Sclim- im more pissed off with Bgr trying to define work as doing something you dont like for money
19-04-2019T01:01:50,SageSaga,it's generally what Bgr does when he wants to argue- he redefines something to fit his argument
19-04-2019T01:01:53,Bgrmystr2,"That's the stereotype of ""work"", the 9 to 5 job in an officebuilding in a cubicle or whatnot."
19-04-2019T01:02:09,RimaDraws,its not necessarily 9 -5
19-04-2019T01:02:22,TheOtherEric,Could we not argue? Maybe?
19-04-2019T01:02:26,Xalrog,"If you love your job, you never have to work a day in your life"
19-04-2019T01:02:29,Bgrmystr2,"not necessarily yeah, but that's the stereotype"
19-04-2019T01:02:44,CrimsonQuill,"My (hopeful) line might be more floating on a boat with a GPS, or going down a mine with a Total Station."
19-04-2019T01:02:46,Bgrmystr2,yes that was the thing Xalrog
19-04-2019T01:03:23,Bgrmystr2,I guess I'm the only one looking at it from the perspective of the original saying :U
19-04-2019T01:06:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I return. Let’s see if stream drops again
19-04-2019T01:07:00,SpazztasticKiwi,this “vacation getaway” thing
19-04-2019T01:07:01,CrimsonQuill,mornin' Spazztastic
19-04-2019T01:07:04,SpazztasticKiwi,?
19-04-2019T01:07:14,CrimsonQuill,It's 7:00am here
19-04-2019T01:07:22,SpazztasticKiwi,I get that much
19-04-2019T01:07:24,Bgrmystr2,"lol kiwi, hope it works"
19-04-2019T01:07:44,SageSaga,you get wired to hate sayings like that when you have people telling you your work isnt worth paying for
19-04-2019T01:08:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"It’ll work, so I leave and when I come back everything returns with a vengeance. Especially the music"
19-04-2019T01:08:10,RimaDraws,yea i hate that...
19-04-2019T01:08:10,SageSaga,as if having fun doing something means you shouldnt be paid for it
19-04-2019T01:08:25,SpazztasticKiwi,*not work
19-04-2019T01:08:42,Bgrmystr2,"that saying was never about the money. If anyone's using that saying against you, sage, they're not even using it correctly to begin with."
19-04-2019T01:08:59,Xalrog,Why would people say that about your art? That makes no sense
19-04-2019T01:09:18,RimaDraws,there are people who think art isnt worth paying for when it is because it is our hard work
19-04-2019T01:09:20,SageSaga,people say it all the time about almost everyones artist
19-04-2019T01:09:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Keith looks like a deer in headlights bless him
19-04-2019T01:09:43,CrimsonQuill,Is this colouring Nora Cards?
19-04-2019T01:09:45,SageSaga,you probably can message any artist online asking them if they ever had to deal with that- and they would say yes
19-04-2019T01:09:57,SpazztasticKiwi,I clearly missed something I see
19-04-2019T01:09:58,Sclimshady,either theyre dumb or dont understand the work that goes into it
19-04-2019T01:10:16,Bgrmystr2,"it's not supposed to mean you don't deserve to get paid, that's just a shitty misinterpretation. Using it incorrectly just makes that person look dumb imo"
19-04-2019T01:10:24,SageSaga,"of course they dont- they think people are just ""born as good artists"""
19-04-2019T01:10:26,Xalrog,Those people are cleary ignorant and anything they say should be ignores
19-04-2019T01:10:56,RimaDraws,it takes dedication.
19-04-2019T01:11:02,CrimsonHelsing,^
19-04-2019T01:11:47,CrimsonQuill,"Yeah, it takes some time to figure out proportions, shadows, and making things look nice..."
19-04-2019T01:12:05,CrimsonQuill,I still haven't got the hang of it yet. :ptv-uneasy:
19-04-2019T01:12:06,RimaDraws,hell i just learned how to use the wand tool last week
19-04-2019T01:12:16,RimaDraws,and ive been doing digital for 7 years
19-04-2019T01:12:29,TheOtherEric,"Agreed. And once you think you have it down, theres more to learn"
19-04-2019T01:12:37,CrimsonQuill,"Heh, well, I'm still using pencils, pen and paper, and trying to figure it out!"
19-04-2019T01:12:46,Bgrmystr2,"it's supposed to mean that if you love your job, you won't need to put forth extra effort and stress into that job, and it won't feel like work. It's about the stigma work has of requiring a lot of effort and increases stress."
19-04-2019T01:12:58,RimaDraws,that is also bullcrap
19-04-2019T01:13:15,CrimsonQuill,"Brg, no matter what job there is, there'll be parts of it one hates."
19-04-2019T01:13:29,CrimsonQuill,That's one thing my parents have taught me.
19-04-2019T01:13:34,Bgrmystr2,"Yes I know that, but that's irrelevant. That's simply the meaning of the saying."
19-04-2019T01:13:46,SageSaga,yeah but the saying is wrong
19-04-2019T01:13:47,Bgrmystr2,It has nothing to do with money or people deserving of anything
19-04-2019T01:13:51,CrimsonHelsing,not necessarily irrelevant I would say
19-04-2019T01:13:51,RimaDraws,yea it is wrong
19-04-2019T01:13:59,Sclimshady,like chronic back pain since i was 21
19-04-2019T01:14:20,CrimsonQuill,Permission to leave debate before I say something stupid.
19-04-2019T01:14:31,Sclimshady,permission granted
19-04-2019T01:14:32,Bgrmystr2,it's not entirely wrong though. There could be jobs where there's no part of it that is stressfull or requires a lot of effort lol
19-04-2019T01:14:48,SageSaga,but its a generalization right? so it should work in most cases?
19-04-2019T01:14:50,Bgrmystr2,"it's just a user experience thing, it's impossible to say it applies to everyone."
19-04-2019T01:14:55,RimaDraws,it is stressful but we love doing our art.
19-04-2019T01:15:17,CrimsonHelsing,^^^
19-04-2019T01:15:17,Twokinds,Done
19-04-2019T01:15:23,SageSaga,its something a rich dick says as they put on their suntan lotion because they made so much money from their family they dont have to work
19-04-2019T01:15:23,RimaDraws,nice job tom
19-04-2019T01:15:28,CrimsonHelsing,gg tom!
19-04-2019T01:15:29,iliar,"Thank you Tom. Without Keith, this art looks a bit unfinished. I hope it was not very difficult."

19-04-2019T01:15:48,TheOtherEric,"Nice one, Tom"
19-04-2019T01:15:52,Twokinds,It wasn't very much effor to add Keith.

19-04-2019T02:06:22,Bgrmystr2,oh looks like I came back on time
19-04-2019T02:06:26,Bgrmystr2,this looks great
19-04-2019T02:07:20,SageSaga,time to look at the script for the comic
19-04-2019T02:07:43,Bgrmystr2,starting work on the comic at 3am
19-04-2019T02:08:30,SageSaga,yeah T_T
19-04-2019T02:08:58,SageSaga,hopefully i can do it in under 2 hours
19-04-2019T02:09:00,Bgrmystr2,"stark contrast from a few streams back when you finished super early at what, 11pm? midnight?"
19-04-2019T02:10:36,SageSaga,i did two 2 character color commissions
19-04-2019T02:12:19,Bgrmystr2,perhaps you could split the color commissions over the fridays so that way you never work too late but also don't have to little to do?
19-04-2019T02:12:31,Bgrmystr2,you seem to have less to do later in the month
19-04-2019T02:12:45,hanesaw13s,nice
19-04-2019T02:13:13,SageSaga,i make sure i have less at the end of the month because theres like 2-3 people who didnt put in their requests
19-04-2019T02:13:28,Bgrmystr2,ahh
19-04-2019T02:13:29,SageSaga,"so the off chance they all say ""HEY! DID I MAKE IT IN TIME?"""
19-04-2019T02:13:37,SageSaga,i have the time to do it...
19-04-2019T02:13:41,Bgrmystr2,xD
19-04-2019T02:17:52,ZRO4825,"Fun part is, I used to be one of the ones who did that. Now I seem to be the most reliable one for getting a request in early. XD"
19-04-2019T02:18:59,Mihari,Well I know mine is in XD
19-04-2019T02:20:19,Sclimshady,"i just noticed your avatar blinks Mihari, i thought it was just the sleep deprivation at first"
19-04-2019T02:20:34,Mihari,Yep.

19-04-2019T03:14:25,ZRO4825,I bounce around windows during streams like a rabbi on speed ^_^
19-04-2019T03:15:28,SageSaga,are Rabbi's on speed known to be bouncy?

19-04-2019T03:35:26,Bgrmystr2,"haha aw, I'd trade."
19-04-2019T03:35:35,SageSaga,"it must have been my Stand, Suffering Artist"

19-04-2019T03:37:06,Bgrmystr2,"oh haha so he's just ""oh no it's that elf girl"""
19-04-2019T03:37:12,ZRO4825,Probably trying to figure out how to avoid putting his foot in his mouth this time. :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
19-04-2019T03:37:45,ZRO4825,"So out of curiosity, is Relm gonna be a long-running comic cast member, or just these early chapters?"
19-04-2019T03:37:46,Vyctorian,This is looking good

19-04-2019T04:54:13,Bgrmystr2,noone has a recording that I'm following
19-04-2019T04:54:21,Bgrmystr2,so it's a picarto thing
19-04-2019T04:54:29,Bgrmystr2,"tom did some nora cards, Toxicator"
19-04-2019T04:55:39,Bgrmystr2,"he did the flora reference, showed off Vampire Rose, and added the spot diagram to Kat's ref"
19-04-2019T04:55:53,Bgrmystr2,and that was basically it.

19-04-2019T13:06:42,RimaDraws,i paid for it months ago
19-04-2019T13:06:44,RimaDraws,in advance
19-04-2019T13:06:49,CrimsonQuill,How much?
19-04-2019T13:07:07,RimaDraws,if she reschedules that trip for next saturday ill tell her to go to hell because i got endgame next saturday. $45
19-04-2019T13:07:11,RimaDraws,for three days

19-04-2019T13:08:13,RimaDraws,this week shes done nothing but screw up
19-04-2019T13:08:55,CrimsonQuill,Anger understandable.
19-04-2019T13:10:31,RimaDraws,nothing is replacing my movie day for endgame when it comes out.
19-04-2019T13:10:45,CrimsonQuill,I am looking really forward to that film.

19-04-2019T13:10:55,CrimsonQuill,Infinity War was incredible.
19-04-2019T13:11:05,CrimsonQuill,I can feel the hype...
19-04-2019T13:11:06,RimaDraws,i might have a friend go with me but if she cant make it i will go alone

19-04-2019T14:46:23,SageSaga,dont think i can finish it in 15 minutes
19-04-2019T14:46:30,Bgrmystr2,haha
19-04-2019T14:46:31,Bgrmystr2,I believe
19-04-2019T14:46:34,Mippy,You stream at such inconvenient times :ptv-unimpressed:
19-04-2019T14:46:50,SageSaga,but consistant
19-04-2019T14:47:09,Mippy,Cat argue with that
19-04-2019T14:47:12,Bgrmystr2,perhaps you simply work in shifts that are at such inconvenient times. :ptv-SteelwormHades:
19-04-2019T14:47:53,Mippy,:ctwokinds-reniderp:
19-04-2019T14:48:07,SageSaga,"i got up early today so i could go get my medicine- and they said ""That will be 370USD"" and i was like ""uhhh- i have insurance?"" and they said ""It didnt work"""
19-04-2019T14:48:32,Mippy,"Dude, not cool."
19-04-2019T14:48:48,BadFoMo,I think I know that story all too well.
19-04-2019T14:50:13,Bgrmystr2,xD sage
19-04-2019T14:50:33,BadFoMo,"AKA; ""So what do you (insert optonal insulting name here) cover?!"""
19-04-2019T14:51:09,Bgrmystr2,"from my experience, it tends to be covered, but the person doing the calcs selling you the medication fucked up somewhere"
19-04-2019T14:51:14,Bgrmystr2,or someone before them fucked up somewhere
19-04-2019T14:51:31,Bgrmystr2,so the stuff in the computer is broked
19-04-2019T14:52:11,Bgrmystr2,But I guess that comes with the territory here.. everyone's just trying to make a buck
19-04-2019T14:52:23,Mippy,Or you got the one cashier in the entire pharmacy that has no idea how to apply the insurance (ran into this problem last time I refill)
19-04-2019T14:52:46,Bgrmystr2,xD which is covered by the 'fucked up somewhere'
19-04-2019T14:53:02,Bgrmystr2,fuckups always covered.
19-04-2019T14:53:04,Mippy,Yeah...:ctwokinds-keith8D:
19-04-2019T14:55:12,Mippy,So... mobile is being shite and I have been looking at blank stream
19-04-2019T14:57:31,Bgrmystr2,I just close the app and reload it
19-04-2019T14:58:07,Mippy,I don’t know if that is a booger on the staff pepper shaker or not
19-04-2019T14:58:12,Mippy,:ctwokinds-zenshocked:
19-04-2019T14:58:56,SageSaga,most boogers are harmless if not still wet and even then- pretty harmless :P
19-04-2019T14:59:34,sunblaze,nom it and you will see :D
19-04-2019T14:59:42,SageSaga,do not do that
19-04-2019T14:59:49,Mippy,"Well, time to go. I’ll be a little o. Break maybe"
19-04-2019T14:59:54,SageSaga,take care!

19-04-2019T15:07:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Didn’t want to double. But my coworker nearly killed me
19-04-2019T15:08:12,Sclimshady,thats some serious workplace tension
19-04-2019T15:08:13,sunblaze,on purpose?
19-04-2019T15:08:16,BadFoMo,...Why does this brush exest outside of this one page?
19-04-2019T15:08:16,SpazztasticKiwi,the store boss actually came back to our area to help make cupcakes and help out
19-04-2019T15:08:46,SpazztasticKiwi,and when I met this coworker back at the back sink she looked me dead in the eye and said “it must be a cold day in hell”
19-04-2019T15:09:20,SageSaga,?
19-04-2019T15:09:34,SpazztasticKiwi,the boss never comes back to help
19-04-2019T15:09:39,SageSaga,To Bad - ?
19-04-2019T15:10:28,SpazztasticKiwi,the only time she does come help would be a cold day in hell
19-04-2019T15:10:29,BadFoMo,The 'Instant-Book' brush.
19-04-2019T15:10:48,SageSaga,is super handy- i have several such brushes
19-04-2019T15:11:08,BadFoMo,...Ok.

19-04-2019T15:12:56,BadFoMo,I knew that.
19-04-2019T15:14:14,SageSaga,I used similar brushes before- though this particular one is new

19-04-2019T15:35:31,Nekonny,OH
19-04-2019T15:35:39,Nekonny,cool
19-04-2019T15:35:47,Nekonny,that is part of clip?
19-04-2019T15:35:55,Nekonny,or assets you made yourself?
19-04-2019T15:35:56,SageSaga,they are free on clip yeah
19-04-2019T15:36:10,Nekonny,"i'll look it up, thanks!"
19-04-2019T15:36:15,SageSaga,but if you want you can make these pretty easy
19-04-2019T15:36:42,Nekonny,how do you add perspective to it though
19-04-2019T15:36:52,Nekonny,guess I would need to see th epage again
19-04-2019T15:37:23,SageSaga,like that
19-04-2019T15:37:24,Nekonny,"ah, manually"
19-04-2019T15:37:26,Nekonny,got it
19-04-2019T15:37:39,SageSaga,a lot easier than drawing a ton of books
19-04-2019T15:38:15,Bgrmystr2,that is really cool sage
19-04-2019T15:43:30,RimaDraws,this looks good

19-04-2019T16:06:31,zsombiofficial,Hello
19-04-2019T16:08:22,SageSaga,yo
19-04-2019T16:13:19,zsombiofficial,What kind of digital tablet do you use for drawing?
19-04-2019T16:14:06,SageSaga,im using a 13HD Cintiq Touch
19-04-2019T16:14:43,SageSaga,a lot of my friends dont use the touch version and i dont know why- i love it for moving around the canvas and zooming in
19-04-2019T16:17:07,SageSaga,its exactly the same as the Cintiq companion except not a stand alone tablet- i also have the companion for drawing away from home
19-04-2019T16:17:54,Azumachan,Can you zoom and rotate ?
19-04-2019T16:18:31,SageSaga,yus
19-04-2019T16:18:38,Azumachan,neat
19-04-2019T16:23:19,zsombiofficial,What are you drawing?

19-04-2019T16:47:23,Bgrmystr2,I wonder how Kaylin got Nyna to wear something actually decent.
19-04-2019T16:47:34,sunblaze,holy.... with nynas colouring that frontpage looks wicked good!

19-04-2019T16:48:50,sunblaze,but with that blue illumination is works jsut fine
