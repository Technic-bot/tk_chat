12-03-2019T17:20:49,Twokinds,I got a new monitor!
12-03-2019T17:20:55,Twokinds,It's so biiiiig
12-03-2019T17:21:02,Twokinds,So much screen realestate!

12-03-2019T17:25:02,Bgrmystr2,30? 40inch? :o

12-03-2019T17:26:41,Bgrmystr2,oh nice
12-03-2019T17:37:05,Dadrobit,Welcome to the world of 1440!
12-03-2019T17:37:32,Dadrobit,"Also, yes. 35"" is humongous."
12-03-2019T17:40:48,Twokinds,"It is only 100Hz, not 144, but that was my compromise for price."
12-03-2019T17:41:56,Bgrmystr2,how much was it? :o
12-03-2019T17:42:22,Twokinds,"Man, $500!"
12-03-2019T17:42:28,Bgrmystr2,damn
12-03-2019T17:42:31,Twokinds,Yeah
12-03-2019T17:42:58,Dadrobit,I'm running 100Hz at the moment as well. That's as much as my poor old GPU can put out. As long as the response time is also nice and quick there shouldn't be any terrible ghosting.
12-03-2019T17:43:06,Twokinds,"I didn't want to spend that much, but I really wanted to try an ultrawide for once."
12-03-2019T17:44:04,Dadrobit,Moderate amounts of jelly. That's up there on the old wishlist. Report back with thoughts after a few months of usage!
12-03-2019T17:48:09,Bgrmystr2,"not quite jealous considering my setup, but it's still better than any of the displays I have. Nicely purchased. :sparkles::ok_hand:"

12-03-2019T18:03:08,Twokinds,"It's so sad. 100hz, but I can only get 45fps on low."

12-03-2019T18:25:58,Dadrobit,I can imagine an ultrawide being super awesome for productivity though. Having all the editing tools and windows open in front with a full sized active preview off to one side on the same screen.
12-03-2019T18:29:16,Twokinds,It'll be nice just for streams
12-03-2019T18:29:31,Twokinds,Can have the obs window chat and references up while I work
12-03-2019T18:30:08,Dadrobit,ohhhhh~
