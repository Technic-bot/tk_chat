17-10-2019T20:25:02,JojoF2415,What are chat rules
17-10-2019T20:25:27,SageSaga,Stream Rules!  Want to post a link? So long as the link is SFW you can post it IF you first describe what the link is of and then post the link. If your description of the link is incorrect- you will be banned for abusing the system.
17-10-2019T20:25:38,SageSaga,"No promotions. Streamers in multi-streams can promote themselves and their works and things they want, but viewers should not promote anything without permission."
17-10-2019T20:25:52,SageSaga,"Links to our official pages is fine. Official Pages include our websites, twitter, and Deviant art/FA accounts. Don't be rude."
17-10-2019T20:26:26,MoonDance,Ah I see. Might be cooped up on a project perhaps
17-10-2019T20:26:43,JojoF2415,Ok cause I got in trouble in another stream because it was English only

17-10-2019T20:27:48,Twokinds,one second
17-10-2019T20:27:48,SageSaga,yeah its an unwritten rule because speaking in a language no one else can understand is like spamming - which is rude

17-10-2019T20:42:55,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nero stay pink with me
17-10-2019T20:43:01,RimaDraws,purple is a good color.
17-10-2019T20:43:06,SageSaga,the more white you add to red the more Mihari seethes with anger
17-10-2019T20:43:09,AnuSekaniArt,Purple is a great color :3
17-10-2019T20:43:11,RimaDraws,i personally like pink and red tho
17-10-2019T20:43:17,CrimsonHelsing,^
17-10-2019T20:43:21,Issus,I'm waiting for that last pic to be the guy singing from over the mountain.
17-10-2019T20:43:21,Twokinds,Purple's a good color.

17-10-2019T20:43:37,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Pink, Green, and blue are my faves"
17-10-2019T20:43:42,AcePilotIV,though if i was forced it would be purple
17-10-2019T20:43:44,Mihari,You don't need to apologize to me for liking / using pink. XD
17-10-2019T20:44:03,SageSaga,"purple is a great color because a lot of people cant see it so you can be like ""ha! you cant even see my favorite color with your defective eyes!"" and then you go to hell for being a horrible person"
17-10-2019T20:44:16,Mihari,O_o
17-10-2019T20:44:24,Issus,"It's funny that pink used to be a manly color because it was ""flesh"" colored, and now it's somehow feminine."
17-10-2019T20:44:31,Issus,Cultures are weird.
17-10-2019T20:44:34,ZRO4825,What if I'm already probably going to hell for being a terrible person anyway? :P

17-10-2019T20:56:05,RimaDraws,im passionate about art but i dont know if im that passionate anymore
17-10-2019T20:56:19,CrRAR,Oh no
17-10-2019T20:56:40,RimaDraws,like its a persuasion powerpoint on what we are passionate about
17-10-2019T20:56:47,RimaDraws,i can go on about disney
17-10-2019T20:57:09,SageSaga,Disney is a sad subject though
17-10-2019T20:57:21,RimaDraws,hmph
17-10-2019T20:57:29,RimaDraws,then i am screwed
17-10-2019T20:57:40,RimaDraws,i was passionate about art
17-10-2019T20:57:46,SageSaga,"""it's so amazing and great and they do so much- it's just destroyed story telling though for the next 150 years"""
17-10-2019T20:57:48,JojoF2415,Ok I’m back
17-10-2019T20:57:52,CrRAR,wb
17-10-2019T20:58:04,RimaDraws,i was talking about old disney stuff not the new stuff sage...
17-10-2019T20:58:35,SageSaga,it started with the old stuff though
17-10-2019T20:58:41,RimaDraws,uh duh
17-10-2019T20:58:43,SageSaga,they changed copyright forever
17-10-2019T20:58:58,RimaDraws,then idk what to do this powerpoint on
17-10-2019T20:59:18,JojoF2415,I used watch old Disney. All I do now is play Geometry Dash and get my bpm up to 156
17-10-2019T20:59:19,AcePilotIV,and there goes my headphones
17-10-2019T20:59:27,Twokinds,Why do a powerpoint on anything
17-10-2019T20:59:46,SageSaga,so its just a power point presentation about something you are passionate about and to persuade others to share that passion?
17-10-2019T20:59:48,RimaDraws,uh because its a speech tom and speeches go well with pictures and powerpoint
17-10-2019T20:59:59,RimaDraws,yea it is
17-10-2019T21:00:11,JojoF2415,Why do I feel I’m the youngest here
17-10-2019T21:00:26,AnuSekaniArt,You'd be surprised XD
17-10-2019T21:00:26,SageSaga,are you 12 or under?
17-10-2019T21:00:42,RimaDraws,also tom its for my interpersonal communications class thats why i have to
17-10-2019T21:00:44,JojoF2415,No I’m in high school freshman
17-10-2019T21:00:53,HoverdudeXL,Nice
17-10-2019T21:00:57,Orthonox,So 14/15 then?
17-10-2019T21:01:06,SageSaga,good- because no one under 13 should be on Picarto SFW or not XD
17-10-2019T21:01:33,JojoF2415,Yeah but I’ve been looking at the stream and people are talking about jobs
17-10-2019T21:01:40,RimaDraws,but i dont know what to do. art isn't something everyone is passionate about
17-10-2019T21:01:55,JojoF2415,I love to draw
17-10-2019T21:01:59,RimaDraws,well
17-10-2019T21:02:02,RimaDraws,i mean not everyone
17-10-2019T21:02:10,SageSaga,you dont need to be passionate for something to get someone passionate about it
17-10-2019T21:02:45,JojoF2415,I tried drawing a comic slide from toms comic and I gave up. The paper size was too small
17-10-2019T21:02:46,CrRAR,"How about crafts, or something else creative?"
17-10-2019T21:02:46,RimaDraws,its in the syllabus for the assignment. something we are passionate about to persuade someone
17-10-2019T21:02:47,SageSaga,so if you do art- focus on one part of it- like the importance of art
17-10-2019T21:03:01,RimaDraws,that's the thing....i dont know what that is...
17-10-2019T21:03:11,JojoF2415,I don’t take art class until this year.
17-10-2019T21:03:21,JojoF2415,I’m self taught
17-10-2019T21:03:30,CrRAR,Nice
17-10-2019T21:03:45,RimaDraws,i always thought that art would be my major in college when i moved to my bachelors but i went with business management and leadership.
17-10-2019T21:03:46,SageSaga,Art's purpose is to enrich human lives
17-10-2019T21:04:05,CrRAR,I feel enriched
17-10-2019T21:04:05,SageSaga,Art defines culture and inspires
17-10-2019T21:04:09,JojoF2415,I like to draw anime and twokinds. Sometimes realism
17-10-2019T21:04:24,AcePilotIV,i can only draw tonks
17-10-2019T21:04:31,CrRAR,Tonks?
17-10-2019T21:04:35,ZRO4825,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRtV-ugIT0k   A link to a video from an artist that I found to be quite a good point about how to look at your own art starting out.
17-10-2019T21:04:35,CrRAR,From Harry Potter?
17-10-2019T21:04:44,CrRAR,or tanks?
17-10-2019T21:04:53,AcePilotIV,tanks
17-10-2019T21:05:01,CrRAR,niiice
17-10-2019T21:05:19,AcePilotIV,at least i can make models
17-10-2019T21:05:19,JojoF2415,I find realism boring though
17-10-2019T21:05:20,RimaDraws,maybe i just found my calling better to be in business than art
17-10-2019T21:05:37,AcePilotIV,as in the the plastic paint and glue ones
17-10-2019T21:05:56,JojoF2415,I drew Kathrin yesterday
17-10-2019T21:06:12,JojoF2415,I’m surprised how clean the sketch was
17-10-2019T21:06:13,SageSaga,art and business are entwined
17-10-2019T21:06:16,RimaDraws,i havent drawn two kinds art since the laura picture i made
17-10-2019T21:06:33,Shierna,can't draw shit.
17-10-2019T21:06:39,AcePilotIV,LOL
17-10-2019T21:06:45,SageSaga,there's more money in art than there is in human necessities
17-10-2019T21:07:22,JojoF2415,The only characters I’ve drawn are flora kathrin natani and roselyn

17-10-2019T21:19:51,Sclimshady,The chrismas music on every station is my personal Hell
17-10-2019T21:19:56,JojoF2415,I don’t celebrate Halloween
17-10-2019T21:19:56,CrRAR,It's a very strange mix of holiday emotions
17-10-2019T21:20:09,JojoF2415,My brother and sister do
17-10-2019T21:20:11,RimaDraws,i mean christmas used to be an okay holiday now its all about getting shit

17-10-2019T21:20:23,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-statuerawr:

17-10-2019T21:21:09,CrRAR,Blasphemy!
17-10-2019T21:21:12,SageSaga,i would argue christmas hasnt changed that much in the past 50 years
17-10-2019T21:21:17,HoverdudeXL,Yea
17-10-2019T21:21:20,JojoF2415,The rest of my friends are ok with it
17-10-2019T21:21:27,CrRAR,oh good
17-10-2019T21:21:40,JojoF2415,In class a kid was accused of being a furry
17-10-2019T21:22:18,CrRAR,dang

17-10-2019T21:22:49,SageSaga,and he was burned at the stake
17-10-2019T21:22:55,CrRAR,haha
17-10-2019T21:23:04,JojoF2415,I drew Kathrin on front of everyone in intro to design and nobody cared
17-10-2019T21:23:05,Sclimshady,Burn the furries!  Oh wait
17-10-2019T21:23:24,HoverdudeXL,Lol

17-10-2019T21:23:52,JojoF2415,My friend says I’m homo because I draw furries. He’s weird though
17-10-2019T21:24:07,Tharkis,when you get old enough you'll reach a state of zen
17-10-2019T21:24:07,CrRAR,That is quite a bad diagnosis.
17-10-2019T21:24:08,Sclimshady,Were all Homo...Homo sapiens
17-10-2019T21:24:13,Tharkis,where you dont GAF what other people think
17-10-2019T21:24:19,Tharkis,and just do what makes you happy =)
17-10-2019T21:24:22,SageSaga,maybe he wants you to be gay because he is and he wants you
17-10-2019T21:24:27,CrRAR,xD
17-10-2019T21:24:31,Sclimshady,lol

17-10-2019T21:25:10,HoverdudeXL,yea
17-10-2019T21:25:12,JojoF2415,He takes it too far u mean too far.
17-10-2019T21:25:23,JojoF2415,I mean auto correct
17-10-2019T21:25:56,JojoF2415,To the point where he shows me weird stuff
17-10-2019T21:25:56,CrRAR,"It's just the social construct of High School, doesn't matter, just survive the four years."
17-10-2019T21:26:07,HoverdudeXL,Yea
17-10-2019T21:26:36,SageSaga,too far like calling people Nakuma or too far like - he runs like Naruto because he thinks its really the superior way to run around?
17-10-2019T21:26:52,CrRAR,"People are trying to find themselves, some folks find friends by finding common enemies those aren't real friendships... seek a higher path~"

17-10-2019T21:27:22,JojoF2415,He just annoys me and he claims he gave his cousin a aheg$& sweater
17-10-2019T21:27:27,SageSaga,it certainly isnt because drawing arms flailing in a normal running method causes the body to shift a lot and makes animating it really hard! <_< >_>
17-10-2019T21:27:38,AnuSekaniArt,XD
17-10-2019T21:28:05,JojoF2415,Anybody melt metal

17-10-2019T21:54:07,BadFoMo,Ok. Anyone else think that Natani just made a nervis remark about Flora's antics and Zen is now messing with her about being careful with Keith or she might end up like her?
17-10-2019T21:54:20,CrRAR,Or maybe that's the infection fever.
17-10-2019T21:54:23,HoverdudeXL,Kinda

17-10-2019T23:37:13,CrimsonHelsing,"speaking of said sword! I wonder if he kept it, or at least some of what's left of it. Idk, I think it'd be cool if that blade was unique in any way, plus you never know when a melee weapon can come in handy, even if you can't remember your swordsmanship"
17-10-2019T23:37:13,SageSaga,Hes the guy who marries Trace and Flora so they can be good christians
17-10-2019T23:37:23,CrRAR,haha
17-10-2019T23:37:24,SageSaga,this is of course a joke
17-10-2019T23:37:26,Ordithus,pfft
17-10-2019T23:37:30,HoverdudeXL,lol
17-10-2019T23:37:34,Sclimshady,Its canon now
17-10-2019T23:37:37,CrimsonHelsing,*Trace's sword I mean
17-10-2019T23:38:00,HoverdudeXL,Oh
17-10-2019T23:38:02,JojoF2415,I plan to forge that sword in the future
17-10-2019T23:38:17,CrimsonHelsing,would be nice to see an updated version of that maybe someday
17-10-2019T23:38:28,CrimsonHelsing,could help in making a more accurate replication
17-10-2019T23:38:42,HoverdudeXL,YeA
17-10-2019T23:38:46,JojoF2415,My sword for my oc is based of a fachion
17-10-2019T23:38:57,JojoF2415,Falchion
17-10-2019T23:38:58,CrimsonHelsing,would also be cool if he got that blade reforged
17-10-2019T23:39:26,CrimsonHelsing,"there's blacksmiths in Edinmire, he has the coin, maybe he could commission them"
17-10-2019T23:39:36,HoverdudeXL,Yea
17-10-2019T23:39:47,JojoF2415,I wish I had a power hammer
17-10-2019T23:39:47,Ordithus,I don't think we've seen that sword since the fight with the bros
17-10-2019T23:40:00,CrimsonHelsing,yeah
17-10-2019T23:40:01,Ordithus,There wasn't much of it then
17-10-2019T23:40:16,CrimsonHelsing,yeah it was shattered after bashing apart a mask
17-10-2019T23:40:25,HoverdudeXL,Oh yea
17-10-2019T23:40:58,CrimsonHelsing,"still, like I said, kinda hope Trace kept it since then, maybe he can reforge it"
17-10-2019T23:41:18,Ordithus,He's probably got more in the estate
17-10-2019T23:41:24,HoverdudeXL,Well see

17-10-2019T23:41:43,CrimsonHelsing,"just feel like that blade is unique to him somehow, other than its design, and silly enough being the first weapon he grabs when he wakes up"
17-10-2019T23:41:53,HoverdudeXL,I feel sleepy again
17-10-2019T23:42:11,JojoF2415,Drink coffee
