07-11-2019T00:07:48,Dadrobit,"By 4 wheeler, do you mean truck or quad ATV?"
07-11-2019T00:09:15,Dadrobit,Had a family friend who did the same for his girl a couple years back. Quads are dangerous as fuck. Dude had already crushed himself once and his wife wanted him to stick around longer.
07-11-2019T00:09:54,SpazztasticKiwi,4 wheeler
07-11-2019T00:10:04,Dadrobit,"Also, trucks aren't exactly the ideal family vehicle if you mean that kind of 4 wheeler."
07-11-2019T00:10:17,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s his tho and all you gotta do is be careful
07-11-2019T00:10:32,SpazztasticKiwi,not like she’s gonna be riding it
07-11-2019T00:10:38,JojoF2415,can I say my biggest accomplishment so far today
07-11-2019T00:11:08,Dadrobit,"""I'll be careful"" are plenty of folks famous last words."
07-11-2019T00:11:50,SpazztasticKiwi,well surely he doesn’t have to just completely give it up I’m sure he liked it
07-11-2019T00:12:11,SpazztasticKiwi,and think how cool it’d be teaching his future kid how to drive it
07-11-2019T00:12:25,Dadrobit,Accidents happen. When you got a wife and kid on the way you gotta make those risk assessments. And quads are dangerous as fuck.
07-11-2019T00:22:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I know a few teens that pulled a heyguyswatchthis and flipped a wheeler on themselves
07-11-2019T00:23:07,SpazztasticKiwi,and I swear none of them around here know what a helmet is even though it’s a literal law
07-11-2019T00:23:26,SpazztasticKiwi,for any open vehicle
07-11-2019T00:26:04,SpazztasticKiwi,and this guy is has listed his truck “for sale” ~$6000 to see how much he can get offered for it
07-11-2019T00:26:24,SpazztasticKiwi,"lift kit, needs new front tires, low miles, new transmission"
07-11-2019T00:26:39,SpazztasticKiwi,extended cab but short bed
07-11-2019T00:27:23,SpazztasticKiwi,what’s he doing
07-11-2019T01:21:00,Dadrobit,"Alas, no such helmet law in AZ. Only need eye protection."
07-11-2019T01:21:15,Dadrobit,Makes me cringe every time I see it.
07-11-2019T01:21:39,SpazztasticKiwi,they only fix it when someone dies
07-11-2019T01:21:51,Dadrobit,"And by eye protection, they mean ""sunglasses""."
07-11-2019T01:22:12,SpazztasticKiwi,that nasty sun gonna cause eye damage
07-11-2019T01:22:47,SpazztasticKiwi,what asphalt? pft asphalt doesn’t go in the eyes dontbesilly
07-11-2019T01:23:02,Dadrobit,"Well, to be honest, as a Phoenician, ""Fuck the sun and all it stands for"" is an understandable sentiment."
07-11-2019T01:23:03,SpazztasticKiwi,sunglasses will do
07-11-2019T01:23:46,Sclimshady,Please dont fuck the sun
07-11-2019T01:24:02,SpazztasticKiwi,but it’s so hot
07-11-2019T01:24:32,Dadrobit,"I mean, we hate the sun so much we went to court over it and outlawed daylight savings time so that we can avoid it that much more."
07-11-2019T01:24:49,Sclimshady,:sun_with_face::ctwokinds-NoraEyebrows:
07-11-2019T01:25:01,SpazztasticKiwi,yes because that controls the sun
07-11-2019T01:25:27,Dadrobit,"AZ has some shit laws, but that is one I'll stand by!"
07-11-2019T01:28:15,Dadrobit,"Also, just finished Carole and Tuesday on Netflix. Pretty good. 6.8/10."
07-11-2019T01:29:00,Sclimshady,"Yiss,  love that anime"
07-11-2019T01:29:13,Sclimshady,Best soundtrack
07-11-2019T01:31:24,Dadrobit,"Interesting premise, mostly likeable characters, questionable dub, inconsistent animation quality, great soundtrack."
07-11-2019T01:34:27,Dadrobit,Most of my bugbears come from my mild dislike of Tuesday. She's just.... Meh. And the animation inconsistency was shocking in places.
07-11-2019T01:34:51,Dadrobit,Especially in the final episodes.
07-11-2019T01:36:27,Dadrobit,"It would swap from what appeared to be fantastically rotoscoped high framerated singing/dancing animations to still frame ""reaction"" images for long stretches that were VERY liberally recycled again and again."
07-11-2019T01:36:48,Dadrobit,Highly off-putting IMHO.
07-11-2019T01:37:09,Sclimshady,"Yeah, I'm hoping she will have a build up to some character development"
07-11-2019T01:38:12,Sclimshady,"I just look at it as to separate parts of the show,  makes it better"
07-11-2019T01:38:48,Dadrobit,Kyoto Animation has spoiled me. Their quality just makes everything else pale.
07-11-2019T01:39:57,Sclimshady,Ive been watching a lot of older animes recently so I havent had that problem
07-11-2019T01:40:25,Dadrobit,"And Bones isn't bad by any stretch of the imagination, but when they stumble, it's really noticeable."
07-11-2019T01:40:29,Sclimshady,They feel so tropey even though they are where the tropes started
07-11-2019T01:43:47,Dadrobit,"Hell, even old stuff was/is better animated than many recent ones. See: Akira, any Ghibli movie..."
07-11-2019T01:47:28,Sclimshady,"Calling up Ghibli is just cheating,  no one will ever live up"
07-11-2019T01:48:41,Dadrobit,"Debatable. Like I mentioned before, Kyoto Animation is damn near fucking flawless in just about everything they do."
07-11-2019T01:49:16,Dadrobit,"Violet Evergreen, Hibike Euphonium, Free!"
07-11-2019T01:50:03,Sclimshady,Ive been meaning to watch Violet Evergreen
07-11-2019T01:51:19,Dadrobit,Do it. I fucking bawled Midway through. 9.5/10 for me. Some of the action bits were a bit overdone.
07-11-2019T01:51:53,Dadrobit,You'll know the episode when you get to it.
07-11-2019T01:52:19,Dadrobit,Favorite anime of the last many years of not all time for me.
07-11-2019T01:52:27,Dadrobit,If not*
07-11-2019T01:53:03,Dadrobit,They're making a movie to be released soon-ish as well.
07-11-2019T01:54:24,Sclimshady,"Hmm, sounds like a binge tomorrow"
07-11-2019T01:56:05,Sclimshady,"Oh wait, its evergarden not evergreen right?"
07-11-2019T01:57:23,Dadrobit,Evergarden

07-11-2019T19:27:11,AspiringNoodle,I'm getting Metro 2033 vibes from that game.  Somebody (or groups of somebodies) somewhere did something REALLY effing stupid
07-11-2019T19:27:37,AspiringNoodle,"And as a result, not only do you have new anomalies, but the spirit and physical realms are intermingling"
07-11-2019T20:04:04,FloofyCat,I thought it only came out on the Steam page
07-11-2019T20:05:39,AspiringNoodle,Just watched a video on bureaucracy and bloat

07-11-2019T21:32:53,unsteddyphoenix,Wait this is Nora'd? By azuma I guess
07-11-2019T21:33:22,Nekonny,which book?
07-11-2019T21:33:56,SageSaga,the title is...
07-11-2019T21:34:00,SageSaga,"""Seriously Seeking Sister! Ultimate Vampire Princess Just Wants Little Sister; Plenty of Service Will Be Provided!"""
07-11-2019T21:34:27,SageSaga,yep
07-11-2019T21:34:30,Twokinds,That's quite the title
07-11-2019T21:34:35,BadFoMo,...Wat?
07-11-2019T21:34:48,SageSaga,so far- it's actually pretty decent
07-11-2019T21:35:10,IronHorseComics,and the award for needlessly longest title goes to...
07-11-2019T21:35:17,Nekonny,they seem like they are enjoying these sort of things
07-11-2019T21:35:17,SageSaga,it's about a vampire that wants a little sister to dote on
07-11-2019T21:36:18,JeremySenpai,boy or Gril Vampire
07-11-2019T21:36:19,SageSaga,but her father wont give her a little sister- so she throws a tantrum and freezes herself in time till she can have her little sister...
07-11-2019T21:37:27,SageSaga,unfortunately it seems she hid in such a place that her family has long since vanished and shes woken up over a thousand years from when she threw her tantrum
07-11-2019T21:37:39,AspiringNoodle,There's the twist
07-11-2019T21:37:50,IronHorseComics,bit of an oopsie there
07-11-2019T21:37:58,SageSaga,so- now she still wants a little sister
07-11-2019T21:38:10,AspiringNoodle,But does she get little sister? I must know! :ptv-excited:
07-11-2019T21:38:29,SageSaga,and her spell was broken by- a cute girl that is a few years younger than her (in stopped time not from time of birth)
07-11-2019T21:39:04,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-excited:
07-11-2019T21:39:10,IronHorseComics,and does she come to the realization that she is now completely alone and her family is now all gone? or does that come later?
07-11-2019T21:39:36,SageSaga,so far she hasnt become her little sister yet- but its cute and classic OP character dealing with relationships and society rather than things solved by killing
07-11-2019T21:39:51,Nekonny,Ah
07-11-2019T21:39:55,Nekonny,stuff shes not used
07-11-2019T21:39:56,Nekonny,to
07-11-2019T21:40:04,Nekonny,mordern arge tech or fantasy?
07-11-2019T21:40:33,SageSaga,still fantasy- but its hit the age where Humans are outbreeding all the other races
07-11-2019T21:40:49,AspiringNoodle,I still sense plenty of shenanigans
07-11-2019T21:40:53,AspiringNoodle,I'm sold :ptv-hearts

07-11-2019T22:25:52,SteelDragonFist,My kroger store is like a second home from home!
07-11-2019T22:26:10,ZahnHolley,I lost my communication

07-11-2019T22:39:49,ZahnHolley,The franchise is my old time favorite
07-11-2019T22:40:05,neocloud88h,It's a great set of movies and some great books

07-11-2019T22:49:48,JustPlaying,how often does tom update the actual story?
07-11-2019T22:49:57,neocloud88h,Maybe the phone just has low self esteem because of how you talk about it

07-11-2019T22:51:34,neocloud88h,That sounds like a weird riddle
07-11-2019T22:51:50,SageSaga,breaking phones- possibly the stupidest thing to do with a phone...
07-11-2019T22:52:37,IronHorseComics,^

07-11-2019T22:52:57,HoverdudeXL,truu
07-11-2019T22:53:29,SageSaga,wasnt there a video of a guy who got angry and tried to snap his phone- and the battery exploded and he got burns all on his hands and shrapnel in his eyes?
07-11-2019T22:53:44,CrRAR,Oh jeez
07-11-2019T22:53:48,neocloud88h,Psh probably a Samsung
07-11-2019T22:54:05,Almighty404,...Wait. Does that mean that Trace won't recognize Flora after she becomes a mother ?
07-11-2019T22:54:16,IronHorseComics,what he gets for being an idiot

07-11-2019T22:55:19,Almighty404,"It still probably was a Samsung, since those seem to be the most frequent brand of Android phones"

07-11-2019T22:58:38,HoverdudeXL,that is garbage
07-11-2019T23:00:22,SageSaga,fix it and stop complaining
07-11-2019T23:01:16,JeremySenpai,^ or go apple
07-11-2019T23:01:28,SageSaga,funny joke
07-11-2019T23:01:29,neocloud88h,Never go to the dark side
07-11-2019T23:01:30,HoverdudeXL,my parrents think apple is garbage
07-11-2019T23:01:36,CrRAR,:grapes:
07-11-2019T23:01:36,IronHorseComics,because they are
07-11-2019T23:01:48,HoverdudeXL,idk if its the internet
07-11-2019T23:02:18,HoverdudeXL,well the app is garbage
07-11-2019T23:02:21,SageSaga,apple products arent garbage unfortunately for those of us who dont like them
07-11-2019T23:02:28,HoverdudeXL,the phone wroks with everything else
07-11-2019T23:02:38,neocloud88h,My understanding is the picarto app is just garbage.
07-11-2019T23:02:50,SageSaga,that's true
07-11-2019T23:03:09,HoverdudeXL,it is true
07-11-2019T23:03:19,HoverdudeXL,who is on phone rn

07-11-2019T23:04:13,HoverdudeXL,yea it dose not let me sign in
07-11-2019T23:04:31,SageSaga,honestly- i would probably use a Desktop streaming app to access a stream on desktop and watch it on a phone via sharing
07-11-2019T23:05:07,SageSaga,adds a bit of lag but it would work better
07-11-2019T23:05:12,HoverdudeXL,yea
07-11-2019T23:05:25,IronHorseComics,"or just look it up on the browser app and go from there, works alright"
07-11-2019T23:05:47,neocloud88h,Aw she's really cute Nekonny
07-11-2019T23:06:48,HoverdudeXL,ima do a factory reset on my phone to see if it works
07-11-2019T23:07:25,neocloud88h,I wouldn't do that if it's just the Picarto app that's acting up but you do yo
07-11-2019T23:07:27,neocloud88h,you*
07-11-2019T23:08:19,SageSaga,if it stops the complaining for a bit im for it

07-11-2019T23:12:55,FloofyCat,I've honestly used mobile chrome to watch Picarto streams
07-11-2019T23:13:15,HoverdudeXL,Oh it does not work for me on chrome that much
07-11-2019T23:13:49,SpazztasticKiwi,aren’t factory resets for wiping a phone and not force stopping apps

07-11-2019T23:14:14,IronHorseComics,"yeah, a soft reset would be better"

07-11-2019T23:14:40,Mihari,I would force stop and purge cache for a app if it was misbehaving.
07-11-2019T23:14:57,HoverdudeXL,I did not factory reset so thatis good

07-11-2019T23:36:23,jackoboy,my mind just shifted to where the comic is finished and maybe tom would redo all the old arts to make it look good XD
07-11-2019T23:36:39,Mihari,"You make me sad sometimes, Ron."
07-11-2019T23:36:47,Nekonny,>.>

07-11-2019T23:38:40,BadFoMo,SMH?
07-11-2019T23:38:40,Mihari,"Pretty sure Flora is laughing, Kat is humouring her, as the only two people in the comic who really care about their bust is Flora and Nat."
07-11-2019T23:38:42,jackoboy,XD
07-11-2019T23:39:03,CrimsonHelsing,lol!

07-11-2019T23:42:20,unsteddyphoenix,Honestly what kind of loyal Flora fan would pick a pic with big breasts
07-11-2019T23:42:31,BadFoMo,I thought he did ones with Flora /and/ Tiger Trace.
07-11-2019T23:42:44,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:ctwokinds-flomad:
07-11-2019T23:42:45,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:ctwokinds-florajiggle:
07-11-2019T23:42:56,unsteddyphoenix,Or...maybe thats the MOST loyal thing a Flora fan could do...hmm...
07-11-2019T23:43:02,jackoboy,yeah
07-11-2019T23:43:03,jackoboy,actually
07-11-2019T23:43:17,Muddy,"Well, she's gonna have larger attributes when the kid's born. That's normal for most gals."
07-11-2019T23:43:26,CrimsonHelsing,^
07-11-2019T23:43:29,FloofyCat,"I love the comic book ""MRA-HA-HA!"" text."
07-11-2019T23:43:57,JojoF2415,I’m back after raging so bad on a video game
07-11-2019T23:44:02,Mihari,"For a while anyway, but they can go either way after birth/nursing is complete."
07-11-2019T23:44:02,FloofyCat,"I mean I love everything else but that's a given, it's just really neat, pfft"
07-11-2019T23:44:14,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah its cute~ I love that laugh
07-11-2019T23:44:28,unsteddyphoenix,"I doubt they go up THAT much though, right Mihari?"
07-11-2019T23:44:28,ZahnHolley,Gnight y’all
07-11-2019T23:44:34,unsteddyphoenix,"Thats like what, 4-5 cup sizes?"

07-11-2019T23:44:45,Mihari,Flora is not THAT flat.
07-11-2019T23:44:49,jackoboy,^
07-11-2019T23:44:56,MarvTheHugPharaoh,She's pretty flat
07-11-2019T23:45:03,jackoboy,but not THAT flat
07-11-2019T23:45:05,ZahnHolley,Have a great night people
07-11-2019T23:45:06,Sclimshady,Flattern a raccoon in a roadway
07-11-2019T23:45:11,Muddy,As long as Flora doesn't get a large as DD or DDD.
07-11-2019T23:45:13,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah. Shes only not that flat atm 'cause shes pregnant
07-11-2019T23:45:18,Mihari,sighs.
07-11-2019T23:45:18,CrimsonHelsing,she has a noticable chest that makes her unmistakably female
07-11-2019T23:45:29,jackoboy,^
07-11-2019T23:45:32,unsteddyphoenix,"Remember her before the pregnancy, she's pretty flat"
07-11-2019T23:45:34,JangoBob,"flora honestly does look better being less ""flat"""
07-11-2019T23:45:37,Mihari,Please don't just use the cup letters for a end all measurement of the chest. T_T
07-11-2019T23:45:41,JangoBob,wonder what trace has to say to this xD
07-11-2019T23:45:44,Mihari,"And again, she's not flat."
07-11-2019T23:45:56,IronHorseComics,she's just smol
07-11-2019T23:45:56,unsteddyphoenix,She...is though.
07-11-2019T23:45:58,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Sythe has more boobage then she does
07-11-2019T23:46:04,Muddy,No.. Flora's not flat.. .definitely not in my eyes.
07-11-2019T23:46:07,ZRO4825,1) Flora isn't entirely flat. 2) Boobs are more than a single cup size. =D
07-11-2019T23:46:09,Mihari,Unless you compare her to standard anime or furry back breaking sizes out there.
07-11-2019T23:46:14,SageSaga,isn't Nyna more flat than Flora?
07-11-2019T23:46:19,Mihari,VERY much so.
07-11-2019T23:46:19,ZRO4825,"^ what Mihari said, lol."
07-11-2019T23:46:29,unsteddyphoenix,"Again, remember to look BEFORE she was pregnant"
07-11-2019T23:46:40,Twokinds,"There'll be a background, but I'm done for the time being."
07-11-2019T23:46:47,BadFoMo,Flora: Yes! My breasts are finally bigger! (Natani walks in with even bigger breasts after giving birth to her and Keith's child.) Flora: FUUU-!
07-11-2019T23:46:50,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nice work Tom
07-11-2019T23:46:51,JojoF2415,Ok
07-11-2019T23:46:51,CrimsonHelsing,"I don't think Trace cares much about how busty or flat she is xD Loves the woman, not just the body"
07-11-2019T23:46:53,unsteddyphoenix,Ok! Great work
07-11-2019T23:46:56,JojoF2415,Nice work

07-11-2019T23:47:12,ZRO4825,"That's also before Tom's artstyle took a drastic jump up in quality, so is that really ""Flora's super flat"" or ""Early Tom figured small is flat is justice""? :P"
07-11-2019T23:47:12,Sclimshady,Lookin good Ron
07-11-2019T23:47:14,Muddy,I remember lady relatives when they were pregnant... lactation made them (obviously) fill out.

07-11-2019T23:48:19,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah sage ending at a reasonable time?
07-11-2019T23:48:20,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Sage, it hasn't even been 3 hours..... how are you almost done 0_0"
07-11-2019T23:48:22,unsteddyphoenix,Too unsettling

07-11-2019T23:49:30,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Oh, sorry"
07-11-2019T23:49:32,Muddy,"Jojo... I'm wondering as well, but I'm betting Flora will have to *really* be showing by then."
07-11-2019T23:49:33,ZRO4825,:musical_note: Iiiiii've been kissed by a Rose on the grey~
07-11-2019T23:49:42,CrimsonHelsing,ooh finishing her ref!

07-11-2019T23:50:38,Muddy,I love Rose... just never thought we'd see her as a spinster when she re-appeared in the comic.
07-11-2019T23:50:40,jackoboy,more
07-11-2019T23:50:56,FloofyCat,@unsteddyphoenix Euchre but as a dragon that is chapeshifting into a cat Keidran cosplaying an old wolf Keidran
07-11-2019T23:51:00,SageSaga,i'll probably work on Mihari's patreon image a bit after i finish this at least
07-11-2019T23:51:02,unsteddyphoenix,Rose reappearing was the best twist that was obvious in hindsight
07-11-2019T23:51:08,Muddy,True
07-11-2019T23:51:20,unsteddyphoenix,Cant believe I didnt see it comin' at all

07-11-2019T23:51:38,BadFoMo,It was?
07-11-2019T23:51:40,jirka,Hmmm Rose
07-11-2019T23:51:40,Muddy,"I'm going with my gut, in that Rose had much to do with Trace's memory loss."
07-11-2019T23:51:56,FloofyCat,@unsteddyphoenix it'd be my request if I wasn't on cooldown!
07-11-2019T23:52:07,unsteddyphoenix,Lol

07-11-2019T23:54:31,jackoboy,.
07-11-2019T23:54:43,Muddy,Young ... if she's got that much magic she could probably make herself look younger.

07-11-2019T23:55:31,Muddy,Besides and older Rose in a bikini? I wonder if gravity might affect her figure?
07-11-2019T23:55:35,jackoboy,baiiiiiii guys
07-11-2019T23:55:47,unsteddyphoenix,Is 'myself but younger' a valid transformation?

07-11-2019T23:56:02,unsteddyphoenix,Wait and its true transformation...
07-11-2019T23:56:14,unsteddyphoenix,Shit is that how Euchre is still alive? Did I solve it?
07-11-2019T23:56:30,MarvTheHugPharaoh,You done did it
07-11-2019T23:56:40,Muddy,Rose's wild red hair reminds me of an Irish gal I dated once.
07-11-2019T23:57:07,unsteddyphoenix,Hope I didnt actually spoilers with my genius
07-11-2019T23:57:21,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Oh heck, Muddy now I'm not gonna stop reading her lines in an Irish accent"
07-11-2019T23:57:54,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-rose: *[TOP O' TE MORNIN' TO YA]
07-11-2019T23:58:02,Muddy,LOL... Let me say I've found Irish gals as (ahem) wild as their hair.
07-11-2019T23:58:03,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:ptv-scilove:
07-11-2019T23:58:33,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Oh man, I can just hear JackSepticeyes voice coming out of her"
07-11-2019T23:58:44,unsteddyphoenix,...weird!
07-11-2019T23:58:48,IronHorseComics,"you realize Rose is southern, right?"
07-11-2019T23:59:38,IronHorseComics,she'd more likely sound like a sweet Georgia peach
07-11-2019T23:59:55,Random124537383,Gtg see y’all later
