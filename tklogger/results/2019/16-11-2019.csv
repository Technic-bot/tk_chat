16-11-2019T15:18:17,TheFreindlyDeathclaw,I got the Double pack
16-11-2019T15:18:49,JojoF2415,"In geometry dash, I was playing god eater easy and died at 77%. My heart rate was around 160 bpm"
16-11-2019T15:19:13,TheFreindlyDeathclaw,Sleepy Natani is always adorable

16-11-2019T15:20:23,JojoF2415,No I was playing a video game
16-11-2019T15:20:37,JojoF2415,Search up geometry dash
16-11-2019T15:20:58,ThingsAreMoving,Lemme get my encyclopedia
16-11-2019T15:22:47,ThingsAreMoving,"geometry is a branch of mathematics that handle shapes, dashing is basically sprinting"
16-11-2019T15:22:49,ThingsAreMoving,checks out
16-11-2019T15:22:58,ThingsAreMoving,good workout
16-11-2019T15:23:07,TheFreindlyDeathclaw,I needs a drank brb
16-11-2019T15:23:08,ThingsAreMoving,running in circles
16-11-2019T15:23:49,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I prefer to run in triangles
16-11-2019T15:24:03,JojoF2415,Search up geometry dash bloodlust
16-11-2019T15:24:21,ThingsAreMoving,"Squares are fun, but try running in cubes"

16-11-2019T15:25:35,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Running in a tesseract.  Now thats pro level
16-11-2019T15:26:15,ThingsAreMoving,"Now that's dangerous, Marv. You could end up in a Moebious loop if you're not careful"
16-11-2019T15:26:46,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Ah, whats life without a dash of recklessness"
16-11-2019T15:27:09,SpazztasticKiwi,safe
16-11-2019T15:27:20,JojoF2415,A joke only geometry dash fans would understand.
16-11-2019T15:27:43,JojoF2415,Teacher says the test is easy. The test: Zodiac
16-11-2019T15:34:16,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Kiwi, Mark and Ethan need parental supervision"

16-11-2019T16:12:27,Chooper,stream lasts till ~4 am where I live so I am usually late for whatever I have to go in the morning

16-11-2019T16:15:00,ThingsAreMoving,"I envy you. I have to be up at 6 in the morning, and the stream usually starts at 9PM local time, so I usually can stick around only for 3 hours"

16-11-2019T18:03:44,TeapotOfDoom,your downlink strongly depends on the density of receivers

16-11-2019T18:04:22,ThingsAreMoving,get several receiver nodes in a city and distribute it wirelesly from there
16-11-2019T18:04:35,TeapotOfDoom,starlink will be sick in rural areas but he already said it's not meant for cities

16-11-2019T22:33:20,totallynotTrace,also this looks really good
16-11-2019T22:34:40,totallynotTrace,this sounds like interstellar not stranger things
16-11-2019T22:38:25,CrimsonHelsing,Mixing realistic look with some of their other features is possible. I've seen it in a portrait on FA
16-11-2019T22:38:49,TheFreindlyDeathclaw,brb after i eat dinner
16-11-2019T22:38:58,CrimsonHelsing,Specifically a portrait someone did of Flora
16-11-2019T22:39:25,Ordithus,She's got those hungry eyes
16-11-2019T22:39:32,CrimsonHelsing,This tbh is somewhere along those lines
16-11-2019T22:39:40,IronHorseComics,when is Flora NOT hungry?
16-11-2019T22:39:48,Katfeathers,"ya, was wondering which of three directions ""more realistic"" would take"
16-11-2019T22:40:03,CrimsonHelsing,"Since the baby, @IronHoeseComics? Not often"
16-11-2019T22:40:07,BluePhantom90,The really funny thing about Tigers and those spots on the back of their ears. They have those white spots to be like fake eyes for other predictors sneaking up behind them
16-11-2019T22:40:34,totallynotTrace,predictors lol
16-11-2019T22:40:34,IronHorseComics,really? I did not know that
16-11-2019T22:40:49,BluePhantom90,*predators
16-11-2019T22:40:53,CrimsonHelsing,That's actually cool
16-11-2019T22:41:22,BluePhantom90,Now here is the other question. What predator would go after a Tiger?
16-11-2019T22:41:40,CrimsonHelsing,I'd imagine her hair would fuse with her fur towards the base on  her head
16-11-2019T22:41:40,CrRAR,SuperTiger
16-11-2019T22:41:41,unsteddyphoenix,"Human, duh"
16-11-2019T22:41:46,Stormagedon,Hey if your hungry
16-11-2019T22:41:55,ProsePro7,Honey Badger
16-11-2019T22:42:01,CrRAR,lol
16-11-2019T22:42:08,IronHorseComics,a lot of preds would go after tiger cubs
16-11-2019T22:42:13,IronHorseComics,plus there's always bears
16-11-2019T22:42:55,IronHorseComics,she actually looks like the tiger mural that was painted on the wall of the basketball gym at the community college I went to
16-11-2019T22:42:57,BluePhantom90,there was a poster that asked that question its still kinda funny
16-11-2019T22:44:27,CrimsonHelsing,"Tigers are practically the biggest big cat outside of hybridization,and the toughest, and the meanest on the block, when provoked"
16-11-2019T22:44:52,totallynotTrace,"""what type of predator would take down a tiger"" ""the super predator called Homo Sapien, duh"""
16-11-2019T22:45:30,totallynotTrace,"homo sapien used pointy stick from distance, it was super effective"
16-11-2019T22:45:36,Ordithus,I've known some house cats that would like to think they're tougher
16-11-2019T22:46:08,IronHorseComics,"park ranger used boom stick on homo sapien for poaching, it's super effective"
16-11-2019T22:46:55,DarthRexKing,Real Vision. :V
16-11-2019T22:47:02,totallynotTrace,was reffering more to ancient hunter gatherer humans not poaching but yeah that too
16-11-2019T22:47:18,BluePhantom90,Would be more funny seeing what Keith and Nat looking like though those glasses
16-11-2019T22:47:44,Ordithus,"Natani like a pretty fluffy wolf, Keith like a rabbit"
16-11-2019T22:47:51,IronHorseComics,"I'm curious more for Keith, I'd be really interested to see what he would look like"
16-11-2019T22:47:55,Ordithus,:rabbit2:
16-11-2019T22:48:03,IronHorseComics,and I don't think he'd loon ENTIRELY like a bunny
16-11-2019T22:48:05,totallynotTrace,if i had to pick one it would be keith cuz you can look up wolves.
16-11-2019T22:48:10,IronHorseComics,*look
16-11-2019T22:48:22,johnnytho,keith would be a rabbit dog thing
16-11-2019T22:48:37,Ordithus,bunny with a long tail and fangs
16-11-2019T22:48:50,totallynotTrace,"yeah john, ive never sean a rabit dog thing, have you?"

16-11-2019T22:49:59,CrimsonHelsing,"Ah, fur-but-no-hair realistic ;P still really damn cool!"
16-11-2019T22:50:31,totallynotTrace,if this doesnt get voted to be colored idk what this community likes
16-11-2019T22:50:32,IronHorseComics,I'd still hug that

16-11-2019T22:51:22,Ordithus,would give chin scritches
16-11-2019T22:51:29,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Flora now in 1080p
16-11-2019T22:51:41,Sclimshady,4K

16-11-2019T22:52:16,Ordithus,In 4K you could see the blood from her last meal still in her fur
16-11-2019T22:52:34,IronHorseComics,"I'd be like ""Please don't eat me."" ""Why would I eat you?"" ""Oh you know, just paranoid is all."""
