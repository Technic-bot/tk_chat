06-07-2019T01:26:37,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-sleepy:
06-07-2019T01:36:44,CrimsonQuill,Morning all
06-07-2019T01:36:59,CrimsonQuill,Is there no stream this week? I can't see any emails.
06-07-2019T01:59:15,Bgrmystr2,missed the point where we've constantly been talking about anthrocon this weekend?
06-07-2019T01:59:33,Bgrmystr2,for several weeks now
06-07-2019T01:59:37,Bgrmystr2,probably over a month.
06-07-2019T02:29:03,CrimsonQuill,No.
06-07-2019T02:29:14,CrimsonQuill,Just wondering if this is the week
06-07-2019T02:29:24,CrimsonQuill,"Besides, I've been busy over the past two weeks."
06-07-2019T02:29:28,CrimsonQuill,Please don't judge me.
06-07-2019T02:29:34,CrimsonQuill,:(
06-07-2019T02:29:53,Bgrmystr2,"It was a question, not a judgement. If it was a judgement, you'd know. :)"
06-07-2019T02:30:00,CrimsonQuill,ok
06-07-2019T02:30:03,CrimsonQuill,ok
06-07-2019T02:30:08,Bgrmystr2,Yes this weekend.
06-07-2019T02:30:18,CrimsonQuill,Okee Dokee
06-07-2019T02:30:22,CrimsonQuill,"Now, Got to go"
06-07-2019T02:30:25,CrimsonQuill,Time for Mass
06-07-2019T02:30:45,CrimsonQuill,See you later
06-07-2019T06:14:21,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-natsducky:
06-07-2019T06:26:46,AspiringNoodle,"JUDGEMENT, JUDGEMENT, JUDGEMENT, JUDGEMENT!!! :ptv-angry:"
06-07-2019T06:26:49,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-snicker:
06-07-2019T06:27:28,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-keithdotdotdot:
06-07-2019T06:29:36,AspiringNoodle,"Huh, honestly thought Extra Credits would stop losing viewers by now"
06-07-2019T06:29:48,AspiringNoodle,Guess things don't play out as quicklyo n the internet as I thought
06-07-2019T06:30:03,AspiringNoodle,Also hi Terra :ptv-greetings:
06-07-2019T06:54:42,CrimsonQuill,"Hullo AspiringNoodle, TerraTheWizard...ummm...What's with the 'Judgement Judgement?'"
06-07-2019T07:02:05,AspiringNoodle,I HEREBY JUDGE YOU :ptv-angry:
06-07-2019T07:02:08,AspiringNoodle,JUDGE
06-07-2019T07:02:09,AspiringNoodle,JUDGE
06-07-2019T07:02:14,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-snicker:
06-07-2019T07:07:18,CrimsonQuill,Oh.
06-07-2019T07:07:21,CrimsonQuill,Hmmm
06-07-2019T07:08:02,AspiringNoodle,Ouch... Extra Credits seems to basically be ignoring the fallout of their recent video...
06-07-2019T07:08:21,AspiringNoodle,"Not a good look for an ""educational"" channel :/"
06-07-2019T07:09:18,CrimsonQuill,What's Extra Credits?
06-07-2019T07:09:38,AspiringNoodle,Channel that covers history and video game design
06-07-2019T07:09:50,CrimsonQuill,Ok...
06-07-2019T07:09:53,AspiringNoodle,"The history part probably ties into their philosophy that in order to make better games, learn ALL the things :D"
06-07-2019T07:10:10,AspiringNoodle,But one of their recent videos... boy is it bad
06-07-2019T07:10:25,CrimsonQuill,How bad?
06-07-2019T07:11:35,AspiringNoodle,"Is intellectually dishonest, has some misinformation, has some logical fallacies.  Even took some plays from Jack Thompson's book."
06-07-2019T07:12:03,AspiringNoodle,What makes it worse is that some of the points made in their video completely go against what they've said in the past on different subjects.
06-07-2019T07:12:36,AspiringNoodle,11k likes - 106k dislikes
06-07-2019T07:12:54,CrimsonQuill,Nasty.
06-07-2019T07:13:20,AspiringNoodle,Didn't help that their community manager basically poured gasoline on the fire via twitter
06-07-2019T07:13:39,AspiringNoodle,I actually unsubscribed because of this...
06-07-2019T07:14:25,CrimsonQuill,Yeesh
06-07-2019T07:15:24,AspiringNoodle,There's a link if you want to watch the trainwreck
06-07-2019T07:15:45,AspiringNoodle,"I know it'll give them ad revenue, but it's worth pointing out how lacking the video is in terms of critical thinking :/"
06-07-2019T07:16:46,CrimsonQuill,"Oooooouch, They done goofed."
06-07-2019T07:17:07,AspiringNoodle,Wait... did you start watching the video?
06-07-2019T07:37:32,AspiringNoodle,Cat attacking objects: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NoAcfa618w
06-07-2019T07:37:49,AspiringNoodle,Just thought I'd share something cute to make up for all the negativity :ptv-hearts:
06-07-2019T09:06:24,CrimsonQuill,Hullo again
06-07-2019T09:06:33,CrimsonQuill,Sorry it took so long to say something
06-07-2019T09:06:39,CrimsonQuill,The cats are so cute!
06-07-2019T09:08:05,AspiringNoodle,"The embargo lifted, and every tech youtuber uploaded their Zen 2 videos all at once!"
06-07-2019T09:08:13,AspiringNoodle,So much AMD @_@
06-07-2019T09:16:44,AspiringNoodle,"Well there's one for the ""what the fuck"" compilation"
06-07-2019T09:17:05,AspiringNoodle,LTT's gaming benchmarks just threw a bombshell into themix
06-07-2019T09:17:14,AspiringNoodle,Rainbow Six Siege:
06-07-2019T09:17:41,AspiringNoodle,9900k: 282 FPS (1080p since I forgot)
06-07-2019T09:17:53,AspiringNoodle,3900x: 332 FPS
06-07-2019T09:27:43,CrimsonQuill,My friend loves a quote from the Raibow Six trailer...
06-07-2019T09:27:48,CrimsonQuill,F@@@ laser sights
06-07-2019T09:29:40,AspiringNoodle,Ha
06-07-2019T09:29:52,CrimsonQuill,We use it in Elite Dangerous for the lasers too.
06-07-2019T09:30:19,AspiringNoodle,"I'll be honest, from what I'm seeing from these benchmarks, get the 3900x if you would've bought the 9900k"
06-07-2019T09:30:39,CrimsonQuill,"I will, once I know what those mean XD"
06-07-2019T09:30:59,AspiringNoodle,"While it's likely that the 3700x will overclock higher (moreso for the 3800x), the extra 4c/8t will come in handy if Rainbow Six Siege says anything."
06-07-2019T09:38:49,AspiringNoodle,Guess I shoudl break it down for the dum-dumbs (non tech-savvy) :p
06-07-2019T09:39:07,AspiringNoodle,9900k: $485 8c/16t Intel processor
06-07-2019T09:39:18,AspiringNoodle,3900x: $499 12c/24t AMD processor
06-07-2019T09:39:32,AspiringNoodle,3700x: $329 8c/16t AMD processor
06-07-2019T09:39:41,AspiringNoodle,3800x: $399 8c/16t AMD processor
06-07-2019T09:39:57,CrimsonQuill,Ok
06-07-2019T09:40:02,CrimsonQuill,So expensive stuff
06-07-2019T09:40:52,AspiringNoodle,"Yeah, except the 3700x is so close to the 9900k in performance (even more than last gen's 2700x), that it's impossible to justify the $150 price premium"
06-07-2019T09:43:45,AspiringNoodle,Aaaaaaaaand apparently Ryzen is sold out everywhere already?
06-07-2019T09:44:01,CrimsonQuill,Oh
06-07-2019T09:44:08,AspiringNoodle,"Nvm, looks like the 3700x is in stock :p"
06-07-2019T09:47:11,CrimsonQuill,...
06-07-2019T09:47:14,AspiringNoodle,And the 3800x is only available in bundles? What?
06-07-2019T09:48:24,AspiringNoodle,"Well, time to watch der8auer and learn what he thinks will be the best overclocking processors :p"
06-07-2019T09:49:03,CrimsonQuill,:)
06-07-2019T09:49:10,CrimsonQuill,"Well, cya in a bit"
06-07-2019T09:49:13,CrimsonQuill,Going for a walj
06-07-2019T09:49:15,CrimsonQuill,walk
06-07-2019T10:10:23,AspiringNoodle,"According to der8auer, at 1.35 - 1.4V, you should be able to get an all-core overclock of 4.2 - 4.3Ghz"
06-07-2019T10:10:29,AspiringNoodle,Not bad.

06-07-2019T11:19:20,AspiringNoodle,So cute <3
06-07-2019T11:47:43,AspiringNoodle,Huh... interesting
06-07-2019T11:47:54,AspiringNoodle,Tell me if this is crazy
06-07-2019T11:48:28,AspiringNoodle,Spending the extra money to buy 3600 CAS16 RAM for a new Zen 2 build could get you up to 50%+ more performance in games over basic 2133 memory
06-07-2019T11:54:48,AspiringNoodle,I need to go lie down for a while... too much information for one man to absorb @_@
06-07-2019T12:23:25,CrimsonQuill,Hahah
06-07-2019T13:11:47,TeapotOfDoom,Those ryzens are epic
06-07-2019T13:12:11,TeapotOfDoom,Aha quill got the upgrade

06-07-2019T13:15:22,TeapotOfDoom,Sounts like a nice evening

06-07-2019T13:15:42,TeapotOfDoom,I hope the rain stops long enough i have to walk the dog
06-07-2019T13:15:57,CrimsonQuill,:)
06-07-2019T13:16:13,CrimsonQuill,I know how to spend my Sunday night
06-07-2019T13:16:28,CrimsonQuill,Seeing as there's no stream on and I read Chapter 16 last night...
06-07-2019T13:16:35,TeapotOfDoom,Nope. It's made by rooster teeth right?
06-07-2019T13:16:43,CrimsonQuill,"Yeah, it is."
06-07-2019T13:17:00,TeapotOfDoom,Then I might have to
06-07-2019T13:17:05,CrimsonQuill,:)
06-07-2019T13:17:26,TeapotOfDoom,I'm also thinking about getting ze upgrade when za ztream iz back
06-07-2019T13:17:41,CrimsonQuill,"Anyway, tonight I'm reading the (relatively short) 10th anniversary chapter...and then re-watching the stream where Tom sketched up Halo Raine."
06-07-2019T13:17:43,CrimsonQuill,:)
06-07-2019T13:17:52,CrimsonQuill,Among the best nights in my life.
06-07-2019T13:18:32,TeapotOfDoom,Haha sounds like it
06-07-2019T13:19:17,TeapotOfDoom,Looks like the rain has stopped for the forseeable future
06-07-2019T13:19:26,TeapotOfDoom,Ima head out

06-07-2019T17:51:21,MisterWho,No streaming today = AnthroCon time
06-07-2019T18:42:11,BadFoMo,"So, is Streamlabs OBS free to use? The ToS is confusing me."
06-07-2019T18:50:42,Bgrmystr2,"yeah it is, but you should probably just use normal OBS"
06-07-2019T18:50:49,Bgrmystr2,Streamlabs has some limitations far as I know
06-07-2019T18:51:40,Bgrmystr2,"it's made specifically for some tasks and is better at the basic OBS, but for everything else and overall it's not as good from what I've heard / read"
06-07-2019T21:20:27,SpazztasticKiwi,y’all
06-07-2019T21:20:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I got tea
06-07-2019T21:20:52,SpazztasticKiwi,this new chick they got to work here
06-07-2019T21:21:23,SpazztasticKiwi,she’s left a bad taste with everyone. I worked with her maybe two hours at one time
06-07-2019T21:22:09,SpazztasticKiwi,"she wasn’t expected to last but today the fan may have fallen from the ceiling. For context, I’ll tell you that to call in sick or late you have a number to call"
06-07-2019T21:23:22,SpazztasticKiwi,she called one of the dept. managers and said “I’m not gonna close tonight. I don’t think I’m gonna work out back there in the deli. Can you tell (store manager) that I won’t be in and if she can put me somewhere else”
06-07-2019T21:24:07,SpazztasticKiwi,store managers not here today. She and the other managers will be learning of this tomorrow when they come in or whenever they come in next
06-07-2019T21:43:09,SpazztasticKiwi,What. In the everloving fuck. Is this https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/524825976597643265/597618522591330314/image0.jpg
