02-12-2019T00:02:47,BadFoMo,Unarmed Security?! Tell me you at least have a tazer!
02-12-2019T00:03:15,AspiringNoodle,It's high-income neighborhood if I remember correctly
02-12-2019T00:03:27,AspiringNoodle,The kind that has its own country club / golf course
02-12-2019T00:03:47,Dadrobit,"Back, had to make a call."
02-12-2019T00:03:54,MarvTheHugPharaoh,wb
02-12-2019T00:04:00,Dadrobit,"And no, totally unarmed."
02-12-2019T00:04:03,Sclimshady,Selling your meth house?
02-12-2019T00:04:45,BadFoMo,"Also, I know my 'friend' would love for open cary to be a thing. His only methed of conseling is a jacket, which gets hot in the summer."
02-12-2019T00:05:40,Dadrobit,"That's the thing, I work for some absurdly rich folks, and 95% don't want actual security, they want a concierge with a badge."
02-12-2019T00:06:06,BadFoMo,Not even a nightstick?
02-12-2019T00:06:32,Dadrobit,"In fact, the last company that worked this post had to get rid of the badges because the residents felt that it is too intimidating to wear a badge."
02-12-2019T00:06:52,AspiringNoodle,...those folks deserve a harsh reality check...
02-12-2019T00:07:25,BadFoMo,WTF are you supposted to do in the event of an attack?!
02-12-2019T00:07:28,AspiringNoodle,"Nothing serious, but enough of a slap in the face that they are pulled out of their little bubble"
02-12-2019T00:07:43,Ordithus,No one deserves bad crap
02-12-2019T00:08:05,AspiringNoodle,"Ord, I doubt these people could survive if they didn't have as much money as they did"
02-12-2019T00:08:10,AspiringNoodle,They're too sheltered
02-12-2019T00:08:21,Dadrobit,That's a huge reason why I left. I got attacked by a pair of drunks who had restraining orders and otherwise wanted in.
02-12-2019T00:08:22,Ordithus,You're not making a convincing argument that something bad should happen to them
02-12-2019T00:08:49,AspiringNoodle,"I said a harsh reality check, and nothing serious"
02-12-2019T00:09:00,Ordithus,"Oh, so that makes it better?"
02-12-2019T00:09:04,Dadrobit,They fucked up my face for over a month.
02-12-2019T00:09:12,AspiringNoodle,Something where nobody gets hurt
02-12-2019T00:09:16,BadFoMo,Dang!
02-12-2019T00:10:12,Ordithus,Kame you always manage to make nice looking outfits
02-12-2019T00:10:15,Dadrobit,And the last security company was slacking super hard and none of the cameras that saw it were functional which fucked with the court proceedings afterwards.
02-12-2019T00:10:23,Kameloh,but ord I rarely draw clothes :eyes:
02-12-2019T00:10:37,unsteddyphoenix,But the ACCESSORIES
02-12-2019T00:10:41,Ordithus,You do most the time I see!
02-12-2019T00:10:46,AspiringNoodle,Sometimes clothing can be more lewd than no clothing :p

02-12-2019T00:11:37,BadFoMo,@AspiringNoodle Like tell them what they have and explane how little what they have wouln't actually help in an attack?
02-12-2019T00:11:38,Kameloh,it's like drawing a bikini vs. drawing underwear
02-12-2019T00:11:40,Sclimshady,Night Jazz
02-12-2019T00:11:42,MarvTheHugPharaoh,nighty night jazz

02-12-2019T00:12:32,Dadrobit,"Most of them would be fine, I know a lot of them are armed themselves."
02-12-2019T00:12:57,Dadrobit,Two of them have their own underground shooting ranges.
02-12-2019T00:13:18,HeresyArtStream,This pic is real cute Kame :3
02-12-2019T00:13:19,AspiringNoodle,"Something tells me that the people with ranges need to talk to the people triggered by badges, lmao"
02-12-2019T00:13:21,Ordithus,Depends on the underwear
02-12-2019T00:13:24,Kameloh,ty!
02-12-2019T00:13:37,BadFoMo,@AspiringNoodle I agree.
02-12-2019T00:14:24,Dadrobit,What about drawing a bikini with underwear?
02-12-2019T00:14:34,BadFoMo,"Also, /underground/ shooting ranges? ...I am interested."
02-12-2019T00:14:42,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
02-12-2019T00:14:53,Kameloh,drawing a bikini vs. drawing underwear: one seems more lewd than the other in some situations :snail:

02-12-2019T00:16:58,Kameloh,D:
02-12-2019T00:17:06,AspiringNoodle,You need at least several layers of clothing beneath underwear
02-12-2019T00:17:06,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Box's and a over sized t-shirt?
02-12-2019T00:17:08,unsteddyphoenix,WHAT?

02-12-2019T00:17:49,AspiringNoodle,Not sure if lewd :thinking:
02-12-2019T00:17:53,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I can feel w0lfy shuddering
02-12-2019T00:18:05,BadFoMo,I think I remember this from part on an episode of... Boy Meets World (maybe?) that I saw /years/ oag.
02-12-2019T00:18:13,AspiringNoodle,oag?

02-12-2019T00:19:10,Dadrobit,"Marv, I'll do you one better. Boxers with a large but unbuttoned dress shirt."

02-12-2019T03:05:52,AspiringNoodle,"I don't know why.  But happy ending?  I can accept it.  I might give the stray thought to the after-story, but nothing too time-consuming"
02-12-2019T03:06:08,HeresyArtStream,"First few chapters are kind of hard to get into because it's very clearly a comic made by a teenager, but part of the fun is seeing Tom's art evolve as it goes."
02-12-2019T03:06:15,AspiringNoodle,"Bad ending?  ""Welp, there goes my week."""
02-12-2019T03:06:39,w0lfmare,It's okay ame
02-12-2019T03:07:09,Dadrobit,"Yeah, basitin isles is the highlight of Tom starting to make a legitimately good comic. Still has elements of youth in it tho."

02-12-2019T03:34:01,Dadrobit,Unsteddy is harder to read than you think. I once thought for like two hours that he just talks to himself during Apex Legends games.

02-12-2019T03:35:48,unsteddyphoenix,Lmao
02-12-2019T03:35:52,unsteddyphoenix,that was so funny

02-12-2019T03:38:04,9LG,I remember it being a big deal for like 2 weeks and then I never heard anything about it again
02-12-2019T03:38:47,Dadrobit,I'm actively terrible on kb/m.

02-12-2019T12:09:11,TeapotOfDoom,the cold air is wonderfull when jogging
02-12-2019T12:19:13,ThingsAreMoving,Swimming my cardio of choice.
02-12-2019T12:21:05,ThingsAreMoving,"One day I've spent 12 hours in a water park. Best day ever. Had to take 2 aspirins cause I got a high fever from exhaustion, but goddamn it was worth it."
02-12-2019T12:22:40,CrRAR,"Yes, swimming is underapprciated. The world needs more pools."
02-12-2019T12:25:31,CrRAR,"Good for muscles, respritory, cardio AND low impact. Easy on knees and other joints."

02-12-2019T12:36:43,ThingsAreMoving,I wasn't aware
02-12-2019T12:37:05,TeapotOfDoom,i like to think it is lol
02-12-2019T12:37:21,TeapotOfDoom,i just shopped a hat on my teapot picture xD

02-12-2019T13:29:10,TeapotOfDoom,btw will there be a third stream tonight?
02-12-2019T13:29:35,ThingsAreMoving,"Dunno, only managed to watch an hour on sunday."
02-12-2019T13:30:09,ThingsAreMoving,Watching a vod of yesterday's stream atm.
02-12-2019T13:43:41,CrRAR,hats on all the things!
02-12-2019T13:43:53,CrRAR,(that are moving)
02-12-2019T13:44:50,CrRAR,The winky Kat emoji would be cute in a santa hat.
02-12-2019T13:53:11,ThingsAreMoving,All of them would be cute
02-12-2019T13:53:48,ThingsAreMoving,"Also, didn't you have a hat on your avatar last year, too?"

02-12-2019T14:20:47,Dadrobit,So... Close...

02-12-2019T14:22:48,Dadrobit,https://i.imgur.com/Uex0Ivi.png
02-12-2019T14:31:14,ThingsAreMoving,That's a nice case. 10/10 would buy again https://i.imgur.com/IX2tfaA.jpg
02-12-2019T14:33:25,Dadrobit,Which series is that? I think It's slightly different. I'm going with the PB600
02-12-2019T14:35:16,Dadrobit,"Also, now that I have the DRP4, I am praying to the case gods that the case is big enough. This is a beefy ass cooler."
02-12-2019T14:35:32,Dadrobit,I may have underestimated its mass.
02-12-2019T14:36:20,ThingsAreMoving,Mine is the Dark Base 700. Three chamber case
02-12-2019T14:37:35,Dadrobit,I considered the 700. But the adjustable top on the 600 really really sold me.
02-12-2019T14:37:38,ThingsAreMoving,"I finally were able to do some proper cable management, and no longer have to suffer due to lack of space when cleaning stuff"
02-12-2019T14:38:46,Dadrobit,"Like, it's just such a ridiculously cool idea to have adjustable elements for better sound dampening on top of the manually adjustable fan speeds."
02-12-2019T14:39:29,ThingsAreMoving,"It is quiet, even when the fans are on max setting"
02-12-2019T14:40:09,ThingsAreMoving,"I'm thinking of upgrading to liquid cooling in the future, and this case will allow a smooth transition"
02-12-2019T14:40:43,ThingsAreMoving,Honestly I don't think I'll need another one for... probably a decade
02-12-2019T14:41:41,Dadrobit,"NGL. I just really don't want to do water cooling. I get that it's ""easier than ever"" to get into. But still..."
02-12-2019T14:41:44,ThingsAreMoving,btw I have a Coolermaster Hyper 212 Evo installed and still have at least 20mm to spare
02-12-2019T14:43:53,Dadrobit,116.00 x 51.00 x 159.00 mm vs 146.00 x 136.00 x 163.00 mm
02-12-2019T14:44:38,Dadrobit,1.26 lb vs 2.5 lb
02-12-2019T14:45:15,ThingsAreMoving,Are you planning on cooling your entire room with that? :ctwokinds-keith8D:
02-12-2019T14:45:44,ThingsAreMoving,"Jeez that's a big one. But it should fit, nevertheless."
02-12-2019T14:46:17,Dadrobit,crosses fingers
02-12-2019T14:47:41,ThingsAreMoving,"""Max.construction height of CPU cooler unit (mm)"""
02-12-2019T14:47:50,ThingsAreMoving,You'll have 4mm to spare. ezpz
02-12-2019T14:47:58,ThingsAreMoving,167mm
02-12-2019T14:48:14,Dadrobit,#Calculated
02-12-2019T14:48:32,ThingsAreMoving,just don't put more than 3mm of thermal paste on your CPU :ctwokinds-keith8D:
02-12-2019T14:49:00,Dadrobit,"I'd be willing to bet it was legit calculated. Ya know, considering they're brand identical."
02-12-2019T14:49:34,ThingsAreMoving,"Yeah, most of the components from the same brand usually are meant to fit with eachother"
02-12-2019T14:49:42,Dadrobit,"Worst ""case"" sceario, I have a wee bulge on one side. Thank goodness I didn't go with tempered glass."
02-12-2019T14:50:17,ThingsAreMoving,Nice tiny pun over there.
02-12-2019T14:50:37,ThingsAreMoving,I think I'll start buying upgrades after I get a pay rise next year
02-12-2019T14:50:38,Dadrobit,I try
02-12-2019T14:50:48,ThingsAreMoving,gotta upgrade my PC before Cyberpunk 2077
02-12-2019T14:51:23,ThingsAreMoving,"Fortunately I only need a new MOBO, CPU and RAM (possibly an M.2 SSD, too)"
02-12-2019T14:51:36,ThingsAreMoving,All the rest is fairly new
02-12-2019T14:52:47,Dadrobit,This is my first build not using a mechanical drive. Decided to take the dive into SSD with an M.2.
02-12-2019T14:53:25,Dadrobit,My current computer I built years ago when SSD's were still rather expensive.
02-12-2019T14:53:33,ThingsAreMoving,I'm hella curious about the efficiency of those
02-12-2019T14:54:47,ThingsAreMoving,"I currently have three SSD drives that I have bought over the course of... five years. The most recent one is a 512GB one, purely for important programs and games"
02-12-2019T14:55:51,Dadrobit,"Well, it's sure as shit gonna be faster than my current drive, and that's what I'm after. Waiting almost a full minute to get Windows booted and all my start up programs booted is getting real old."
02-12-2019T14:57:18,ThingsAreMoving,Yeah I feel you. With a SATA SSD my system boots in about 15 seconds. And I have a fair bit of stuff in my autostart
02-12-2019T14:57:37,ThingsAreMoving,I imagine having M.2 would cut that time at least in half
02-12-2019T14:57:53,Dadrobit,Anywho. I am off to bed. I stayed up way too damn late waiting for my packages. Can still get 5 hours if I got to bed now >.>

02-12-2019T18:16:38,TeapotOfDoom,i hope he publishes the version of adira with the viewfinder. it was just so much more funny
