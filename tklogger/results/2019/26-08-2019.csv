26-08-2019T00:16:49,AspiringNoodle,I had my slushie and cheezburg3r
26-08-2019T00:17:03,AspiringNoodle,Still got a Yoohoo.  And I finally bought a reusable cup :D
26-08-2019T00:17:20,AspiringNoodle,Not to mention my manager was SUPER nice and bought most of my stuff for me tonight
26-08-2019T00:17:32,AspiringNoodle,It was $10 worth ;w;
26-08-2019T02:33:35,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-kingtea:
26-08-2019T02:35:13,AspiringNoodle,AAAAAAAAND DONE
26-08-2019T02:35:20,AspiringNoodle,GPU overclock dialed in <3
26-08-2019T03:41:59,qwe304,Are the Templar inherintly evil of is it just the remnants of traces coup de' utat that are the bad guys?
26-08-2019T03:42:06,qwe304,*or
26-08-2019T03:56:09,Sclimshady,"I'd say Trace made it evil,  before it was just slightly intolerant"
26-08-2019T03:57:34,Sclimshady,The festival of beasts was still a thing before Trace
26-08-2019T04:48:59,Yarik1866,wait stream ^ ^
26-08-2019T04:58:40,Sclimshady,??
26-08-2019T05:49:00,TerraTheWizard,the templar were just a mage guild

26-08-2019T12:11:05,AspiringNoodle,Love the new stream offline image <3
26-08-2019T12:16:37,TerraTheWizard,technically it's the old one but yeah
26-08-2019T13:24:23,AspiringNoodle,"Well, I am still new*ish* xD"
26-08-2019T13:36:31,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-florajiggle:
26-08-2019T13:43:04,Sclimshady,Natani is a real cute loaf though :ctwokinds-smug:
26-08-2019T15:28:13,CrimsonQuill,EXAMS DONE.
26-08-2019T15:28:16,CrimsonQuill,FINALLY.
26-08-2019T15:29:17,TerraTheWizard,nice
26-08-2019T15:33:53,Sclimshady,Noice
26-08-2019T15:34:24,CrimsonQuill,*breathes sigh of relief*
26-08-2019T16:28:36,RimaDraws,hi
26-08-2019T16:29:19,Sclimshady,Hi Rima o/
26-08-2019T16:31:56,CrimsonQuill,Hello Rima
26-08-2019T16:51:36,RimaDraws,heyo
26-08-2019T17:04:44,CrimsonQuill,And goodnight all
26-08-2019T17:06:02,Sclimshady,Night Quill o/
26-08-2019T17:54:21,RimaDraws,oh boy i have so much to do
26-08-2019T18:00:30,RimaDraws,"art, homework, and other things like my podcast to write out for this week"
26-08-2019T18:03:24,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
26-08-2019T18:36:47,AspiringNoodle,*slaps self in face*
26-08-2019T18:37:05,AspiringNoodle,"Alright, saw the Lion King remaster blatant cash grab, got dinner, should probably do some grocery shopping later"
26-08-2019T18:37:26,AspiringNoodle,Time to see about fixing my processor woes!
26-08-2019T18:56:58,Sclimshady,"Ugh, homework.  why do I need gen ed classes for a technical degree?"
26-08-2019T19:22:33,AspiringNoodle,"Because they want you to be a ""well-rounded person"""
26-08-2019T19:22:45,AspiringNoodle,"Aka, ""We want to charge you for an additional 2 years of classes"""
26-08-2019T19:26:14,RimaDraws,i personally think its good to have general studies to refresh but i had those in a two year college but mine was supported with aid and scholarships
26-08-2019T19:28:15,RimaDraws,also i love the lion king remake

26-08-2019T20:26:05,RimaDraws,hii
26-08-2019T20:26:58,CrRAR,hello rima!
26-08-2019T20:27:11,CrRAR,how are you?
26-08-2019T20:27:18,RimaDraws,sick with heartburn
26-08-2019T20:27:24,CrRAR,ugh
26-08-2019T20:27:25,RimaDraws,but other than that ok i guess
26-08-2019T20:27:44,CrRAR,get some cinnamon toast
26-08-2019T20:27:58,RimaDraws,i took some pepcid
26-08-2019T20:28:06,RimaDraws,none of those natural remedies work for me
26-08-2019T20:28:11,CrRAR,good plan
26-08-2019T20:28:13,CrRAR,aww
26-08-2019T20:28:17,RimaDraws,i think i had too much salt this week and its upset me
26-08-2019T20:29:34,CrRAR,"yeah it happens, too addicting any of that stuff"
26-08-2019T20:29:40,CrRAR,"I had like half a bag of ""organic"" cheetos earlier"
26-08-2019T20:29:54,CrRAR,something tells me they're not any better than regular ones
26-08-2019T20:30:10,CrRAR,but they're puffy and delicious
26-08-2019T20:39:43,AspiringNoodle,"Oh Rima, I saw the Lion King today as well :D"
26-08-2019T20:40:09,AspiringNoodle,"Also, I've been enjoying the new PC <3"
26-08-2019T20:42:44,CrRAR,excellenté
26-08-2019T20:42:52,AspiringNoodle,"And CrRAR, I think I tried planter's version of cheetos once"
26-08-2019T20:43:08,AspiringNoodle,The serving size was much larger for the same amount of calories
26-08-2019T20:43:15,CrRAR,lol the peanut man makes cheetos?
26-08-2019T20:43:26,AspiringNoodle,"After eating them, it was easy to see why.  They were very light and regular cheetos quite dense :P"
26-08-2019T20:43:28,CrRAR,interesting
26-08-2019T20:44:42,CrRAR,"I grew up with the ""Jax"" cheese curls, but yeah when I saw cheetos had poofy ones I wanted to try em."
26-08-2019T20:48:42,CrRAR,conclusion: poofy wins again
26-08-2019T20:48:46,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-adiracoin:
26-08-2019T20:49:12,AspiringNoodle,I wonder when I'll get around to tweaking my CPU performance
26-08-2019T20:49:37,AspiringNoodle,"So far, RAM is set (not really interested in OC'ing a factory oc'd kit), and my GPU has stable settings"
26-08-2019T20:52:35,CrRAR,"The tinkering can be fun, the gains are cool to measure, but realistically it isn't crazy worth it."
26-08-2019T20:58:47,IronHorseComics,that moment when you don't know what the title of the chapter should be
26-08-2019T21:01:37,AspiringNoodle,iunno :P
26-08-2019T21:01:56,AspiringNoodle,My Heaven score is 91.2 default
26-08-2019T21:02:04,AspiringNoodle,94.3 with core clock oc
26-08-2019T21:02:11,AspiringNoodle,98.4 with core / memory clock oc
26-08-2019T21:02:20,AspiringNoodle,And 97.2 with the final *stable* settings :P
26-08-2019T21:02:52,AspiringNoodle,Got me an extra 6 fps <3
26-08-2019T21:03:15,CrRAR,:ptv-ohmy:
26-08-2019T21:03:38,CrRAR,What % gain is that 5-10%?
26-08-2019T21:03:41,AspiringNoodle,"So far, my 32GB kit of memory is running at the rated 3600 16-16-16-36 timings"
26-08-2019T21:03:48,AspiringNoodle,6 - 7%
26-08-2019T21:03:54,CrRAR,nice
26-08-2019T21:04:17,AspiringNoodle,"I don't really feel like tinkering with RAM timings atm, lol"
26-08-2019T21:04:32,AspiringNoodle,So all that's left is to properly set up the boosting behavior for my 3700x
26-08-2019T21:04:58,CrRAR,"Latency isn't super worth paying attention too, if you can get them tighter than that's good."
26-08-2019T21:05:17,CrRAR,The thing is with every new gen of RAM latency values have actually crept up.
26-08-2019T21:05:27,AspiringNoodle,Indeed
26-08-2019T21:05:59,CrRAR,Clock even back when with like 8-8-8-12 timings or whatever all th emagazines always told you to chase clocks.
26-08-2019T21:06:07,AspiringNoodle,"3600CL16 has a slightly higher ""true latency"" than 3200CL14, BUT testing has shown that it can result in significant gains over the latter"
26-08-2019T21:06:24,CrRAR,I see
26-08-2019T21:06:35,AspiringNoodle,"Keep in mind, this is Ryzen specific"
26-08-2019T21:07:32,AspiringNoodle,"So, 3600CL16 is a latency of 8.89ns, 3200CL14 at 8.75ns"
26-08-2019T21:09:08,CrRAR,I see
26-08-2019T21:25:52,HoverdudeXL,Hi
26-08-2019T22:00:36,AspiringNoodle,"Hehe, looks like my OC might not have been 100% stable ^^;"
26-08-2019T22:00:44,AspiringNoodle,"Dropped the core clock another 15 mhz, looks good now :D"
26-08-2019T22:20:44,RimaDraws,boop
26-08-2019T22:40:14,AspiringNoodle,Oh no... the urges are coming
26-08-2019T22:40:59,AspiringNoodle,"Apparently when I was a child, there was a period of 3 weeks where I watched the Lion King EVERY night"
26-08-2019T22:41:05,AspiringNoodle,...must resist >_<
26-08-2019T22:49:36,RimaDraws,oh my
26-08-2019T23:08:07,RimaDraws,night!
