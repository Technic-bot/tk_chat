05-03-2019T13:33:05,Twokinds,Came across this while looking up common desktop resolutions. Clearly an old article lol
05-03-2019T13:33:11,TerraTheWizard,lol
05-03-2019T13:41:27,Twokinds,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KXHTRT5/
05-03-2019T13:41:33,Twokinds,I think this monitor looks good?
05-03-2019T13:42:15,Dadrobit,Sticking with 1080?
05-03-2019T13:42:41,Twokinds,Yeah for the framerate
05-03-2019T13:42:49,Twokinds,(And the price)
05-03-2019T13:42:57,Dadrobit,Understandable.
05-03-2019T13:43:24,Twokinds,"The higher res ones are very expensive, especially if you want 1ms response time"
05-03-2019T13:44:01,Twokinds,"I mean, unless there's a really good one out there I'm missing."
05-03-2019T13:44:06,Twokinds,I am willing to take suggestions XD
05-03-2019T13:45:17,Dadrobit,"I got a 1440 at 120hz myself, but it did in fact cost an arm and a leg."
05-03-2019T13:46:36,Twokinds,I am hoping not to spend $500+ dollars if I can avoid it.
05-03-2019T13:49:09,Dadrobit,"For sure, I think my monitor was right at that $500 range, and it's only a 24 inch model."
05-03-2019T13:55:52,TorqueEmUp,"I gotta wonder though if anyone can really notice a 1ms response time, or if that's just gaming monitor marketing mumbo jumbo. :P"
05-03-2019T13:56:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I wake up and come over here to start the day and I see numbers
05-03-2019T13:56:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Egh
05-03-2019T13:56:35,Twokinds,"Well, anything is probably better than using my wacom tablet as a gaming monitor"
05-03-2019T13:56:44,Twokinds,With it's response time of 12ms
05-03-2019T13:58:53,TorqueEmUp,I am going to watch a video on monitor response times to try and understand this more before I start spouting stuff I don't fully understand. lol
05-03-2019T14:01:52,TorqueEmUp,"But yeah, I ain't a picky person. I used a 43"" 4k TV that I just recently bought for $200 as a monitor, I am sure the response times are probably shit. lol"

05-03-2019T14:08:09,Twokinds,I'm not all that picky either
05-03-2019T14:08:31,Twokinds,"But if given the choice, I would like to make sure the monitor I ultimately do get for my new PC is at least not garbage XD"
05-03-2019T14:08:49,Twokinds,"Since I don't know much about monitors, I do like to get second opinions"
05-03-2019T14:08:55,TorqueEmUp,Very Understandable
05-03-2019T14:10:49,iliar,I think for the artist more important is a high-quality matrix with good color rendition than the response time.
05-03-2019T14:11:24,Twokinds,"Well of course, but I already have that with my Cintiq."
05-03-2019T14:11:43,Twokinds,Right now my second monitor is very bad
05-03-2019T14:11:51,TorqueEmUp,"Yeah, I was going to say, he'd probably still use his tablet for arting."
05-03-2019T14:12:05,Twokinds,"It's an old monitor, with 72% color gamut"
05-03-2019T14:12:38,Twokinds,"I actually like to use it for art, to see what people with crappy monitors see when they view my work XD"
05-03-2019T14:12:45,TorqueEmUp,"Sounds like the 24"" Dell Monitor I was using up until recently that was still CFL backlit."
05-03-2019T14:12:47,TorqueEmUp,XD
05-03-2019T14:16:21,TorqueEmUp,These gaming monitors are stupidly priced IMO. 3 inch bigger screen costs over $100 more.
05-03-2019T14:17:46,TorqueEmUp,But then again I don't personally understand what goes into making a panel that can display 144hz.
05-03-2019T14:18:27,TorqueEmUp,"I keep wanting to think it's just them ""Oh it's ""gaming"" related so charge insane prices for it."" :P"
05-03-2019T14:25:20,TorqueEmUp,If you're not concerned with it being a refurb. This monitor has the same tech specs for less than half the price.

05-03-2019T14:26:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Samsung gave Ethan a 120hz 49‚Äù curved monitor
05-03-2019T14:26:02,TorqueEmUp,I need to stop copy pasting the address bar
05-03-2019T14:26:18,SpazztasticKiwi,for gaming
05-03-2019T14:29:35,TorqueEmUp,"If you just want to stay at the under $500 mark, then I'd be looking at 1440p 144hz displays"
05-03-2019T14:30:32,TorqueEmUp,"Or if you want want raw pixel count, go for a small 4k TV."
05-03-2019T14:31:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"I figure that‚Äôd be overkill or not for you but other than knowing what Mark, Ethan, & Se√°n uses, I don‚Äôt have much on insight"
05-03-2019T14:32:12,TorqueEmUp,Well a small 4k tv costs less than most 1080p gaming monitors.
05-03-2019T14:32:25,Twokinds,It does seem like a good deal
05-03-2019T14:32:35,Twokinds,The only issue is that it's a TN penl display rather than IPS
05-03-2019T14:32:49,TorqueEmUp,"ahh, my bad, I didn't notice that."
05-03-2019T14:34:15,TorqueEmUp,"I just kinda automatically assumed most displays, especially if it's a monitor, would be IPS by default."
05-03-2019T14:34:44,Twokinds,"Yeah it doesn't say it anywhere on the amazon page, so I had to look it up."
05-03-2019T14:35:07,Twokinds,"Still, for almost 200 dollars less, it's a good deal."
05-03-2019T14:37:43,TorqueEmUp,"Honestly looking at most of these gaming monitors on Amazon, a lot of them seem to use TN panels."
05-03-2019T14:39:51,TorqueEmUp,Yeah seems like IPS can pretty much double the price.
05-03-2019T14:45:33,TorqueEmUp,"TNs are going to be cheaper, but IPS will give you better viewing angles, and color accuracy."
05-03-2019T14:51:38,TorqueEmUp,Honestly a good TN panel can be just as good as a crappy IPS.
05-03-2019T14:53:47,TorqueEmUp,"And I doubt it's really all that noticeable, but apparently IPS displays can have more input lag over TN."
05-03-2019T14:54:26,TorqueEmUp,Just something to think about possibly.
05-03-2019T14:54:59,TorqueEmUp,"But time for me to stop spamming the chat, and finally roll out of bed for the day."

05-03-2019T15:17:21,Dadrobit,"Probably my only complaint about my current workstation setup is the screen size. I'm working off of an i7-7700 with 16 gigs of ram and a GTX 1050, so it's beefy enough to run Pro Tools under load, but damn what I wouldn't do for a proper screen sometimes"
05-03-2019T15:18:03,Dadrobit,"15.6"" is just.. Not fun..."

05-03-2019T15:19:27,Dadrobit,I don't NEED a big screen. 99% of the time I'm just looking at a single audio track so it's whatever. But it does feel cramped.
