05-12-2017T02:30:29,Dadrobit,Except real social interaction. He stays away from that unless gratuitous coupons are involved.
05-12-2017T02:30:34,MidnightBlue78,its pretty common
05-12-2017T02:30:37,unsteddyphoenix,Being attractive is cheating agreed

05-12-2017T02:38:41,Bgrmystr2,Ain't difficult.
05-12-2017T02:39:18,rawrimawolf,u rite
05-12-2017T02:39:34,MarvTheHugPharaoh,the pillars of the ancients
05-12-2017T02:40:22,TheBeckoner,large chocolate
05-12-2017T02:40:52,Dadrobit,Ancients? Isn't this Clovis's crib? Dude's not that old?
05-12-2017T02:41:39,Kullax,Remember to Save :3
05-12-2017T02:41:45,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"the pillars are ancient, they have come to bless the two dancing"
05-12-2017T02:41:53,rawrimawolf,"we can dance, we can dance"
05-12-2017T02:42:00,Dadrobit,if we want to
05-12-2017T02:42:03,Serpentfrog,No one who is very old has a crib.
05-12-2017T02:42:09,Bgrmystr2,I wouldn't think so Dadro. I think this is potentially where The Dragon Masquerade took place.
05-12-2017T02:42:09,rawrimawolf,we can leave your friends behind
05-12-2017T02:42:32,Dadrobit,But Clovis was at his own place no?
05-12-2017T02:42:58,Serpentfrog,"And sketches are canon, no?"
05-12-2017T02:43:02,Bgrmystr2,xD
05-12-2017T02:43:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,they are canon when the please my bais's
05-12-2017T02:43:21,Bgrmystr2,Zen wasn't at Clovis's place though.
05-12-2017T02:43:21,Serpentfrog,My eyes.
05-12-2017T02:43:26,Dadrobit,"I mean, I totally could be wrong, but I figured this was something Clovis put on for a show/reputation boost."
05-12-2017T02:43:34,Bgrmystr2,I just don't see that.
05-12-2017T02:44:17,Bgrmystr2,"Seems more like the showroom for the Dragon Masquerade, and clovis is watching from a distance. Tis where everyone would have been anyway."
05-12-2017T02:44:54,Dadrobit,Maybe probably.
05-12-2017T02:45:14,Bgrmystr2,"Anything is possible, it was a sunday sketch after all. :thinking:"
05-12-2017T02:45:17,Dadrobit,Just that Clovis wasn't there.
05-12-2017T02:45:23,Dadrobit,Also that.
05-12-2017T02:45:48,Bgrmystr2,"well, Zen and Raine didn't go to where Clovis was either"
05-12-2017T02:46:19,Dadrobit,"Aye, but this doesn't have to be ~that~ masquerade."
05-12-2017T02:46:20,Keilani5747,Wolfu is the orchestrator of it all
05-12-2017T02:46:25,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"they went were the dance is, didn't find it so they made it"
05-12-2017T02:46:34,rawrimawolf,Let's dance
05-12-2017T02:46:40,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:ctwokinds-KatDance:
05-12-2017T02:46:41,Bgrmystr2,"maybe not, Dadro, but it is the same outfit Zen is wearing."
05-12-2017T02:46:42,rawrimawolf,put on your red shoes and dance the blues~
05-12-2017T02:47:00,Dadrobit,Outfiuts are expensive yo. Probably only has that one.
05-12-2017T02:47:17,MarvTheHugPharaoh,its a great outfit
05-12-2017T02:47:21,Bgrmystr2,"It is, Marv"
05-12-2017T02:47:22,TheBeckoner,not if you steaaaaaaaaaaal

05-12-2017T02:48:14,TheBeckoner,yup
05-12-2017T02:48:26,TheBeckoner,maybe i sleep now
05-12-2017T02:48:30,Bgrmystr2,I'd just question what reason they would be anywhere other than the Dragon Masquerade. They were there for reason. There's too many questions unanswered to really place this setting
05-12-2017T02:48:36,Dadrobit,"Just woke up for a call, not tired now, so streaming is it for me."
05-12-2017T02:49:11,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"I was tired, but then I saw Zen and Raine, now i'm woke as fuck"
05-12-2017T02:49:17,Dadrobit,Clovis might like to show off his wealth. Having a ball with everyone important might be in his calendar.
05-12-2017T02:49:17,TheBeckoner,WOKE

05-12-2017T02:50:48,Bgrmystr2,"No I mean like, the dance being at their place is out of nowhere. There's no setting to support it other than the guy's flamboyancy"
05-12-2017T02:50:55,Bgrmystr2,which is very little
05-12-2017T02:51:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"they are in the dance hall in Traces manor, my head canon at least"
05-12-2017T02:51:30,Bgrmystr2,xD
05-12-2017T02:51:45,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, just as likely as anything else"
05-12-2017T02:51:53,Bgrmystr2,though how would clovis be there haha
05-12-2017T02:51:59,CrimsonHelsing,Aye

05-12-2017T02:52:42,unsteddyphoenix,H-he's just keeping an eye on him is all~

05-12-2017T02:53:11,TheBeckoner,nice
05-12-2017T02:53:13,Dadrobit,"But there also is the fact that Clovis was nowhere near the estate. Zen- ""We were the ones traveling halfway across human lands to get this for you."""
05-12-2017T02:53:34,Dadrobit,spoilers btw
05-12-2017T02:53:39,unsteddyphoenix,That's what Zen THOUGHT
05-12-2017T02:53:47,TheBeckoner,im all read up
05-12-2017T02:54:04,Bgrmystr2,"the thing is, we can place both Zen and Raine at the Masquerade. We know they were there for a fact. We don't know where Clovis was."

05-12-2017T15:08:58,Twokinds,stretches
05-12-2017T15:11:35,MidnightBlue78,Good Morning Tom!!!
05-12-2017T15:11:51,iliar,"@Twokinds I want to clarify one thing. On page 100 Euchre says ""I’m twenty-one."". And on characters page ""Raine Age: ~18"". 21-18=3. That is, Euchre was 3 years old when Raine was born. How is this possible?"
05-12-2017T15:11:58,MidnightBlue78,*[Stretch carefully]
05-12-2017T15:14:01,Twokinds,"The word Euchre means ""to deceive"""
05-12-2017T15:14:23,MidnightBlue78,"ah, makes sense"
05-12-2017T15:15:39,MidnightBlue78,Euchre is a big fat furry liar
05-12-2017T15:18:40,Twokinds,"He doesn't want people to know he's pushing 30, because in a few more years it'll be very suspicious for someone the equivient of 120 to be walking around like it's no big deal."
05-12-2017T15:20:40,MidnightBlue78,"but,he's a deceiver, he can make others believe he's younger, right?"
05-12-2017T15:21:06,MidnightBlue78,"he can make himself look young, i mean, if thats the issue"
05-12-2017T15:23:59,Twokinds,"Sure, but it's be strange for Flora to see Euchre, a childhood friend, years later and he looks younger. Or exactly the same."
05-12-2017T15:24:09,Twokinds,He has to show some signs of aging.
05-12-2017T15:24:15,iliar,Hm... If I'm not mistaken on stream you said now Rose 18 years old. And Raine 18 years old too. Rose liar too?
05-12-2017T15:24:36,Twokinds,Shh spoilers

05-12-2017T15:26:21,MidnightBlue78,Tom I cant give you enough praise for the flora nora card. It turned out incredible :ctwokinds-rainehappy:
05-12-2017T15:26:54,Twokinds,Thanks!
05-12-2017T15:27:23,MidnightBlue78,its my favorite from all of them
05-12-2017T15:28:13,Azumachan,Thanks Midnight
05-12-2017T15:28:26,Azumachan,I hope Tom had fun doing it.
05-12-2017T15:28:40,MidnightBlue78,thank you for sponsoring it :)
05-12-2017T15:29:33,Azumachan,I have my eyes on some old unfinished wallpapers too
05-12-2017T15:29:39,Azumachan,2007 ish
05-12-2017T15:32:41,MidnightBlue78,I look forward to them
05-12-2017T15:33:14,Azumachan,If Tom is okay with it of course.
05-12-2017T15:58:31,iliar,Nora card holders problem. Tom have so many good sketches. And you have only one card per month.
05-12-2017T16:12:28,MidnightBlue78,Choosing must be quite a task. I dont know if I'd like to be in their shoes....
05-12-2017T16:12:54,MidnightBlue78,"Who am I kidding, of course I do"
05-12-2017T16:17:33,Twokinds,Erugh
05-12-2017T16:17:58,Azumachan,What's wrong ?
05-12-2017T16:18:00,Twokinds,"I really hate this, but I just can't eat spicy foods anymore. It messes my stomach up all the next day. ;_;"
05-12-2017T16:18:12,Twokinds,"But like 50% of Korean food is spicy, and I love spicy food..."
05-12-2017T16:18:33,Azumachan,Olive oil helps
05-12-2017T16:18:59,MidnightBlue78,"that's really a bummer, not being able to eat the things you like"
05-12-2017T16:19:31,MidnightBlue78,do you have a lot of pain right now?
05-12-2017T16:22:59,MidnightBlue78,"If you can, try having pepcid or zantac on hand to help with that"
05-12-2017T16:24:21,TheBeckoner,If I eat cereal too early in the morning it messes me up pretty good. Only in the morning tho
05-12-2017T16:41:57,Twokinds,It's NEVER helped.
05-12-2017T16:43:11,Twokinds,Sad thing is I always say NEVER AGAIN the next day but I always do.
05-12-2017T16:44:21,TheBeckoner,Always do? You mean you end up eating spicy food again lol?
05-12-2017T16:45:07,Twokinds,Of course.
05-12-2017T16:45:23,Twokinds,I wouldn't be in pain now if I ever learned my lesson.
05-12-2017T16:46:10,TheBeckoner,lol My dad was like that until one day he a had a gallbladder attack and puked everywhere...not a good day
05-12-2017T16:49:58,MidnightBlue78,:ctwokinds-sadtrace2:
05-12-2017T16:51:01,MidnightBlue78,"yeah, i remember a few weeks ago you had the same thing happen and you still ate those jalapeños"
05-12-2017T16:57:22,MidnightBlue78,"You are addicted to spicy, you need a serious intervention :ctwokinds-clovischuckle:"
05-12-2017T17:14:44,QuinnAuer,"this is a weird suggestion out of the blue, but you could try pro-biotic tablets"
05-12-2017T17:15:29,QuinnAuer,"After several years on and off anti-biotics I found that wheat based things gave me terrible indigestion, things like bread or pastry"
05-12-2017T17:16:09,QuinnAuer,and it was because the anti-biotics had killed the bacteria in my stomach that digested that kind of food. You might be getting something similar
05-12-2017T17:17:07,MidnightBlue78,that actually sounds like a good suggestion
05-12-2017T17:17:31,MidnightBlue78,it wouldnt hurt to try
05-12-2017T17:19:06,QuinnAuer,"I'd preface it with a warning of 'I'm no doctor', but I am a doctor. It's just in physics so I could be just as wrong as any other fool on the internet."
05-12-2017T17:20:16,TheBeckoner,"I second the probiotics, I have had good luck with them"
05-12-2017T17:22:21,TheBeckoner,experience* Idk why said luck

05-12-2017T23:38:39,ZRO4825,I wanna use 64GB of RAM for just games. NEVER run out of RAM again. :3
05-12-2017T23:38:51,Bgrmystr2,"lol, not that it'll help"
05-12-2017T23:38:52,Serpentfrog,Download more RAM.
05-12-2017T23:38:55,Bgrmystr2,cuz games have limitations too
05-12-2017T23:39:00,Bgrmystr2,and ram will not help that
05-12-2017T23:39:03,ZRO4825,"Nope, won't help, but it'd be fun anyway =D"
05-12-2017T23:39:20,funnyman42,I only got so much because it was on sale and I wanted to.

05-12-2017T23:39:28,Bgrmystr2,xD I highly doubt that having 1 or 2 more sticks of ram when you don't use it will increase your fun in any way.
05-12-2017T23:39:32,TheBeckoner,Also fixed my icon issue
05-12-2017T23:39:55,ZizzoGaming,@TheBeckoner how?
