10-12-2017T00:05:03,Dadrobit,Is... Is it safe to come out again?
10-12-2017T00:05:15,DontuDare,maybe
10-12-2017T00:05:27,iZute,yep!
10-12-2017T00:05:34,iZute,we are somewhere else
10-12-2017T00:05:49,unsteddyphoenix,The bad kids can't hurt you anymore~
10-12-2017T00:07:50,Dadrobit,"I'm torn. On the one hand, I should probably get some rest for tomorrow's final. On the other hand, I know my shit's gonna blow everyone else's out of the water and I literally have nothing to worry about, so screw it, more Monster Hunter Beta."
10-12-2017T00:08:31,Dadrobit,"One of these hands is the correct hand, and I am not sure which is which..."
10-12-2017T00:08:40,unsteddyphoenix,Oh snap that betas out
10-12-2017T00:08:55,unsteddyphoenix,Do you have to sign up or whatever?
10-12-2017T00:09:10,Dadrobit,"Yepper, it's very simplified, but it's super good still. Very hyped."
10-12-2017T00:09:25,Dadrobit,On PS4 you just go to the store and download it.
10-12-2017T00:09:34,unsteddyphoenix,Yo I'll try it out later
10-12-2017T00:09:41,Dadrobit,Dunno if the other platforms have it up or not.
10-12-2017T00:09:58,unsteddyphoenix,Do you really need to sleep for fruit day?
10-12-2017T00:10:38,Dadrobit,"Well I also have to do an oral presentation for the showing, but I got that on lockdown for moderately obvious reasons."
10-12-2017T00:11:24,Dadrobit,Public speaking has been good to me after I hit middle school.
10-12-2017T00:11:57,unsteddyphoenix,Heh. I can imagine.
10-12-2017T00:12:14,Dadrobit,"Though I did forget my lines in a school play in the second grade and just stood there crying, so I wasn't always amazeballs."
10-12-2017T00:12:42,Dadrobit,"From that day forward, I promised myself, ""NEVER AGAIN WILL I BE DEFEATED"
10-12-2017T00:12:44,Dadrobit,""""
10-12-2017T00:13:06,unsteddyphoenix,Current defeat record since then?
10-12-2017T00:13:40,Dadrobit,Only been knocked out twice.
10-12-2017T00:13:50,Dadrobit,Once by my eye doctor.
10-12-2017T00:14:07,Dadrobit,That was funny as hell.
10-12-2017T00:15:17,Dadrobit,"I was super not okay after a really long shift, hadn't eaten all day, barely anything to drink, and when the doc starting probing my eyeball I had a bit of a panic attack and my body was like, ""Fuck it, I'm out..."""
10-12-2017T00:15:51,Dadrobit,Woke up with him supporting my upper body as I slumped out of the chair.
10-12-2017T00:17:09,Dadrobit,"Doc said I was the third that year. Rare, but it happens."
10-12-2017T00:17:13,unsteddyphoenix,That sounds really convenient considering
10-12-2017T00:19:51,Dadrobit,"The other time was when I asked this super androgynous kid in the eighth grade if they were a dude or a chick in my English class. They slammed the back of my jaw, right on the button with a textbook. GG, lights out for me."
10-12-2017T00:20:16,Dadrobit,Never figured it out either.
10-12-2017T00:21:10,Dadrobit,"Got into a few fights other than that, came out on top otherwise."
10-12-2017T00:23:14,Bgrmystr2,"You didn't deserve that one, Dadro"
10-12-2017T00:23:20,Bgrmystr2,they're just a shitty kid
10-12-2017T00:23:30,Bgrmystr2,don't worry about it
10-12-2017T00:23:38,unsteddyphoenix,Hahaha
10-12-2017T00:23:56,Bgrmystr2,I would have jumped his ass for ya
10-12-2017T00:23:59,Bgrmystr2,that's bull xD
10-12-2017T00:24:09,Bgrmystr2,happens a lot here
10-12-2017T00:24:16,unsteddyphoenix,I feel like I'd REALLY wanna know if a girl knocked me out
10-12-2017T00:25:37,Dadrobit,I'm moderately sure it was just a really lithe dude who hadn't quite gotten the hang of puberty yet.
10-12-2017T00:26:33,Dadrobit,"Had no way to see it coming, another kid started talking to me right before I got blindsided."
10-12-2017T00:26:38,unsteddyphoenix,But not COMPLETELY
10-12-2017T00:26:44,Dadrobit,But it's whatever.
10-12-2017T00:26:53,Dadrobit,It's a funny story now.
10-12-2017T00:27:01,unsteddyphoenix,Could've been a natani in training
10-12-2017T00:27:51,Dadrobit,Maybe that's why I like TK so much; I'm still subconsciously trying to figure all this gender stuff out.
10-12-2017T00:28:23,unsteddyphoenix,This IS the webcomic to do it
10-12-2017T00:28:39,Dadrobit,"No, this is the comic to obfuscate the matter further."
10-12-2017T00:29:01,unsteddyphoenix,Eh either or
10-12-2017T00:29:46,Dadrobit,"No, that's the point I think, that there is no either/or. There's a lot of grey area."
10-12-2017T00:30:12,Dadrobit,"At least, I think that's the point."
10-12-2017T00:31:48,unsteddyphoenix,Touche. I like to think the point is that in the end it's not all that important
10-12-2017T00:31:57,Dadrobit,There ya go!
10-12-2017T00:32:20,Dadrobit,"""Fuck it, I got mine"" That's a motto to live by!"
10-12-2017T00:32:48,Dadrobit,"Right next to, ""What would Brian Boitano do?"""
10-12-2017T00:33:27,unsteddyphoenix,Uh
10-12-2017T00:36:18,Dadrobit,It's kind of a mixed message huh?
10-12-2017T00:37:15,unsteddyphoenix,Whoever he is he's workin with some nice alliteration
10-12-2017T00:38:24,Dadrobit,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNJmfuEWR8w
10-12-2017T00:40:50,Dadrobit,"Fuck, that's nearly a twenty year old reference I just made.... God I feel weirdly old...."
10-12-2017T00:43:51,unsteddyphoenix,Reference nearly as old as you
10-12-2017T00:44:39,Dadrobit,Lolwut? I saw the movie when it came out.
10-12-2017T00:47:26,Dadrobit,"Granted, I was probably not exactly as old as I should have been. But whatever, I think I turned out alright."
10-12-2017T00:47:50,Dadrobit,I just tend to avoid androgynous optometrists and it's all god.
10-12-2017T00:48:01,Dadrobit,good*
10-12-2017T00:48:20,unsteddyphoenix,You have a very specific weakness
10-12-2017T00:51:05,Dadrobit,It's the only one I admit at least :)
10-12-2017T00:51:42,Dadrobit,Better than being weakened by proximity to a rock from my home planet. I'd be screwed.
10-12-2017T00:54:23,unsteddyphoenix,And your parents probably weren't killed by your weakness so that's another plus
10-12-2017T00:54:56,Dadrobit,The odds are ever in my favor.
10-12-2017T00:56:02,Dadrobit,Unless it's a Sunday vote. Fuck the odds there.
10-12-2017T00:58:25,unsteddyphoenix,Haha at your success rate has increased exponentially
10-12-2017T01:00:29,Dadrobit,"I suppose, to be fair, though I've only won twice, I've gotten like 6 sketches."
10-12-2017T01:00:52,Dadrobit,"By the way, thanks again Tom for all the awesomeness!"
10-12-2017T01:04:27,unsteddyphoenix,I too have enjoyed all the awesomeness
10-12-2017T01:06:06,Dadrobit,7 sketches actually. NotBad.png
10-12-2017T01:06:28,Dadrobit,Bloated slightly by a double feature last Christmas.
10-12-2017T01:06:53,Dadrobit,7o7
10-12-2017T02:23:55,Dinoman515,Anyone still here?
10-12-2017T02:24:48,Dinoman515,"Nope, obviously... xD"
10-12-2017T07:36:02,Devlfry,me?
10-12-2017T09:58:34,MetalAppleSauce,Herro?
10-12-2017T14:53:21,RandomTKLover,When its 38 outside and you‚Äôre the only one wearing short sleeves. ‚ùÑÔ∏è
10-12-2017T15:14:59,Bgrmystr2,you're nuts
10-12-2017T15:21:23,DontuDare,i wear sweaters in 90-100 degree weather but thats just me
10-12-2017T18:00:00,RandomTKLover,"There was snow on the ground, and I didn‚Äôt even care."
10-12-2017T18:07:14,Dinoman515,O_o
10-12-2017T18:36:41,Dadrobit,Just got back from my Sound Design II class finals presentations. My partner and I absolutely blew everyone else out of the water! \o/
10-12-2017T18:36:45,Dadrobit,FeelsGoodMan.zip
10-12-2017T18:42:35,TheBeckoner,Congrats man. Your project was the audio edit on that video you linked right?
10-12-2017T18:46:13,Dadrobit,"Yeah, came in on my day off and a bit early on finals day to get in a few more hours of work to make some more mixing and fine tune adjustments, but the video that I uploaded to YT is more or less the final project."
10-12-2017T18:47:41,Dadrobit,Next semester I'm gonna spend the first two or so weeks working on the project some more. We're gonna head into the studio proper and mix it in 5.1 Surround to get our feet wet in that area.
10-12-2017T18:48:28,Dadrobit,Then the rest of the semester will be a single project
10-12-2017T18:48:39,Dadrobit,Kind of like a capstone project.
10-12-2017T19:01:50,RandomTKLover,"Congrats dad, good luck"
10-12-2017T19:02:00,RandomTKLover,üëç
10-12-2017T19:02:52,MidnightBlue78,Congratulations Dadro üéâüéâüéâüéâüéâ
10-12-2017T19:35:21,CrRAR,Huzzah!
10-12-2017T19:35:59,Combak,Congrates Robit.
10-12-2017T19:42:34,Combak,"So, looks like a stream tonight is unlikely."
10-12-2017T19:45:45,BluePhantom90,"well maybe. could be at 9pm like Wed,Fri."
10-12-2017T19:49:58,Bgrmystr2,Mon streams not scheduled.
10-12-2017T19:50:01,Bgrmystr2,potentially unlikely
10-12-2017T19:50:04,Bgrmystr2,:u
10-12-2017T19:50:54,Combak,"It's normally a Nora card if it happens, and Tom did two Friday, so..."
10-12-2017T19:51:28,BluePhantom90,Well Tom still has to do those two other sketches
10-12-2017T20:30:13,BadFoMo,I thought he would do those off screen.
10-12-2017T20:31:24,Bgrmystr2,he said he would probably do the Flora school one off-screen
10-12-2017T20:31:58,Bgrmystr2,he'll prolly do the other one off-screen too
10-12-2017T21:03:59,RandomTKLover,"Really, that one got the card?"
10-12-2017T21:07:05,Dadrobit,"The Nora flirting one? Yeah, he said he'd do it off-screen and post it as a surprise."
10-12-2017T21:07:13,Dadrobit,"Also, thanks y'all. :D"
10-12-2017T21:09:46,Combak,Can someone post the sketch for the Nora flirting one? I can't seem to remember it.
10-12-2017T21:09:57,Dadrobit,It's not done yet.
10-12-2017T21:10:16,Combak,"Also, the Flora at School in her Underwear was a Sunday suggestion, not a Nora card."
10-12-2017T21:10:43,Combak,"Wait, what? A Nora card on something that isn't even a scketch?"
10-12-2017T21:10:48,Combak,*sketch
10-12-2017T21:10:55,Dadrobit,I was referencing BGR and Blue.
10-12-2017T21:11:02,Combak,Oh.
10-12-2017T21:11:04,Dadrobit,There are two sketches that need to be done.
10-12-2017T21:11:10,Dadrobit,One being the Nora flirt.
10-12-2017T21:11:21,Combak,"Oh, I see."
10-12-2017T22:35:50,TheBeckoner,"So I woke up extra early today because I thought I had a final this morning at 9. As it turned out, it wasn't till wednesday and I didn't even need to wake  up till like 10."
10-12-2017T22:35:59,TheBeckoner,RIP a healthy amount of sleep
