14-11-2017T17:16:17,MidnightBlue78,I think you need more practice xD
14-11-2017T17:20:01,BluePhantom90,I mean he did tell us his job is his art. And he doesn't sleep in and do what ever he wants
14-11-2017T17:22:12,MidnightBlue78,"hmmm, idk, Tom is always working"
14-11-2017T17:23:35,MidnightBlue78,"Tom, do you draw in your dreams too? legitimate question"
14-11-2017T17:25:07,Twokinds,I'm pretty sure I have a few times
14-11-2017T17:26:30,MidnightBlue78,is it things you draw all the time or things you've never seen before?
14-11-2017T17:30:30,Twokinds,I once had a stream where there was a chapter early on during the Trace Flora Keith travel days where they're climbing a mountain.
14-11-2017T17:30:55,BluePhantom90,hmm
14-11-2017T17:31:11,Twokinds,"When I woke up, I was determined to go find it, before quickly remembering that it never happened."
14-11-2017T17:31:23,BluePhantom90,making sure this is not cannon huh
14-11-2017T17:31:35,BluePhantom90,or spoiler
14-11-2017T17:32:02,Twokinds,"For a minute, I was certain it actually happened somewhere around chapter 3 or 4 and I somehow just forgot to post the entire chapter."
14-11-2017T17:32:59,BluePhantom90,lol wow
14-11-2017T17:33:57,MidnightBlue78,that's interesting

14-11-2017T17:36:28,BluePhantom90,oh btw did you get that story I send\t you Tom?
14-11-2017T17:37:05,MidnightBlue78,"i really hope i'm wrong, although if that were the case, you're not going to tell us"
14-11-2017T17:37:20,BluePhantom90,your crazy its ending soon Midnight. unless your predicting Toms Death?
14-11-2017T17:37:30,BadFoMo,Weren't we all talking about it?

14-11-2017T17:38:32,MidnightBlue78,it's just me assuming
14-11-2017T17:39:28,MidnightBlue78,"since team a and team b might be meeting soon, although i know there is still much to develop in the comic"
14-11-2017T17:39:32,BluePhantom90,could be your feeling your time is coming soon Midnight? I mean people have predicted their own deaths before
14-11-2017T17:39:39,MidnightBlue78,oh crap

14-11-2017T18:19:33,Bgrmystr2,"hey, I would have been here earlier but the firefox devs think they're the center of the universe, so that's cool"
14-11-2017T18:19:38,Bgrmystr2,had to fix what they broke
14-11-2017T18:19:55,Bgrmystr2,got it all working again
14-11-2017T18:20:33,Kinipshun,is that not what's in the center of the  universe? i giant flaming fox??
14-11-2017T18:20:47,Bgrmystr2,naw
14-11-2017T18:20:56,Kinipshun,it totally has to be
14-11-2017T18:20:57,Bgrmystr2,they just want you to think so
14-11-2017T18:21:04,Kinipshun,BUT IT IS
14-11-2017T18:21:57,Kinipshun,(whispers in your ear): it is
14-11-2017T18:22:27,Bgrmystr2,"mmm, mawh."
14-11-2017T18:22:33,Bgrmystr2,nope
14-11-2017T18:22:54,Bgrmystr2,they aren't remotely perfect enough.
14-11-2017T18:23:11,Kinipshun,then how do you explain laura???
14-11-2017T18:24:25,Bgrmystr2,laura isn't firefox. Laura is Ascended Fox.
14-11-2017T18:24:47,Kinipshun,true. but she's still perfect
14-11-2017T18:24:56,BluePhantom90,well she was fire Fox when she was cremated.
14-11-2017T18:25:00,Bgrmystr2,"She is, but firefox is not."
14-11-2017T18:25:22,Bgrmystr2,"The ash is just a coincidence, Blue. :P"
14-11-2017T18:25:24,Kinipshun,true. firefox the browser sucks
14-11-2017T18:26:40,Bgrmystr2,"better than the others, at least version 56"
14-11-2017T18:27:09,Kinipshun,i still like chrome better
14-11-2017T18:27:30,Bgrmystr2,"wouldn't touch chrome with a 10 mile pole, never will"
14-11-2017T18:27:55,Kinipshun,what if i paid you to
14-11-2017T18:28:05,Bgrmystr2,they can go fuck themselves.
14-11-2017T18:28:16,Kinipshun,okay then
14-11-2017T18:28:21,Bgrmystr2,My privacy has no value and cannot be bought.
14-11-2017T18:28:30,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-unimpressed:
14-11-2017T18:28:51,Kinipshun,i have no argument for that lol
14-11-2017T18:28:56,Kinipshun,cuz ur right
14-11-2017T18:29:32,Bgrmystr2,tis why I don't use chrome or google search either
14-11-2017T18:29:34,Kinipshun,"but i dont really use chrome that much, and when i do, i dont really do anything that would require pravacy"
14-11-2017T18:30:06,Kinipshun,bgr ima get you the google pixel 2 for your birthday
14-11-2017T18:30:06,Bgrmystr2,"I don't really either, it's the principle they step on"
14-11-2017T18:30:15,Bgrmystr2,lol nuh
14-11-2017T18:30:19,Kinipshun,XD
14-11-2017T18:31:35,Kinipshun,"the problem with being anti-google these days, is google has interlaced themselves so heavily into the internet, it's hard to use it for extended amounts of time without google eventually becoming involved"
14-11-2017T18:32:28,Bgrmystr2,yeah that's true
14-11-2017T18:32:43,Bgrmystr2,I'm not exactly anti-google really
14-11-2017T18:32:47,Bgrmystr2,just anti-spying
14-11-2017T18:32:56,Bgrmystr2,and I know damn well what they're doing
14-11-2017T18:33:15,Kinipshun,understandable but not completely relateable
14-11-2017T18:33:22,Kinipshun,]and yeah they totally are
14-11-2017T18:36:26,Kinipshun,"and you can use ""Incognito mode"", but its usually more hassle than it's worth, and STILL some things ARE tracked"
14-11-2017T18:42:57,Kinipshun,"honestly, i hate to say this, but on some computers, internet explorer/edge is ACTUALLY pretty good in comparison to all the other browsers. usually it's a heaping sack of cow shit, but on SOME SELECT machines, its not that bad"
14-11-2017T18:43:55,Bgrmystr2,yeah that applies to most things
14-11-2017T19:34:10,BluePhantom90,this is Sick. would do a Sketch idea with Osiris poping into Twokinds Reality for a joke. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyIP0PGPlTU

14-11-2017T21:44:52,Bgrmystr2,it's just a line
14-11-2017T21:44:57,Bgrmystr2,the first one is the original one

14-11-2017T21:46:45,Bgrmystr2,you did
14-11-2017T21:46:56,midnight777,......
14-11-2017T21:47:16,Dadrobit,777 is more like dusk. Not quite Midnight.
14-11-2017T21:47:40,MidnightBlue78,not quite lol
14-11-2017T21:47:52,midnight777,What
14-11-2017T21:48:05,Bgrmystr2,it's ok midnightblue isn't dark vibrant blue enough to be midnight blue
14-11-2017T21:48:07,SpotTheLeopard,dusk is the start of a new night. I shall dub thee newnight
14-11-2017T21:48:10,Bgrmystr2,"so I mean, they're even on that"
14-11-2017T21:48:17,Bgrmystr2,at least original midnight is closer.
14-11-2017T21:48:51,MidnightBlue78,my color is like that bc then no one can read it
14-11-2017T21:49:00,midnight777,I thought we were leaving the original or other alone
14-11-2017T21:49:02,Dadrobit,777 Is the crepuscularity before Midnight.
14-11-2017T21:49:05,RichterApokalypse,+
14-11-2017T21:49:10,Bgrmystr2,"not only that, but you can't increase the vibrancy of the colors anyway"
14-11-2017T21:49:12,MidnightBlue78,I've tried
14-11-2017T21:49:48,MidnightBlue78,"No, this is going to continue most likely"
14-11-2017T21:49:59,Bgrmystr2,as usual

14-11-2017T23:08:30,MidnightBlue78,that was golden
14-11-2017T23:08:40,Twokinds,Heheh
14-11-2017T23:08:42,unsteddyphoenix,Tom when you were learning to draw did you do the method where you measure with the head?
14-11-2017T23:08:54,Twokinds,"Uh... I mean, yeah, I learned that."
14-11-2017T23:09:19,Dadrobit,Apply it though? Evidence points elsewhere lol.
14-11-2017T23:09:29,Combak,"Tom is self-taught, at first, so... Not really. :p"
14-11-2017T23:09:38,Twokinds,No
14-11-2017T23:09:41,Twokinds,I don't use it.
14-11-2017T23:09:56,unsteddyphoenix,Hm~ I see...
14-11-2017T23:10:16,Twokinds,My characters have pretty large heads. A lot of cartoony art does.
14-11-2017T23:10:34,Dadrobit,http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/20/  And sometimes super long bodies
14-11-2017T23:10:36,BluePhantom90,btw tom whats your Magic Rune style basied off?
14-11-2017T23:11:13,unsteddyphoenix,That method just seems like a huge amount of work
14-11-2017T23:11:17,unsteddyphoenix,For not so much payoff
14-11-2017T23:11:26,Twokinds,"Uh, nothing really."
14-11-2017T23:11:34,Dadrobit,"Yeah, not really in the vein of TK"
14-11-2017T23:11:54,Twokinds,It's not like that
14-11-2017T23:12:09,BluePhantom90,So just drew random symbols?
14-11-2017T23:12:25,Twokinds,I don't think there's any artist out there that actually measures out the heads of their characters every time they draw them.
14-11-2017T23:12:41,unsteddyphoenix,Well I assume you graduate from it.
14-11-2017T23:12:46,Twokinds,It's just about creating a model and then keeping everything consistant.
14-11-2017T23:13:22,Twokinds,But head size varies from character to character.
14-11-2017T23:14:05,unsteddyphoenix,"True, true."
14-11-2017T23:14:16,unsteddyphoenix,"A consistent style, so to speak?"
14-11-2017T23:14:32,unsteddyphoenix,Im trying to work out the most efficient way to practise.
14-11-2017T23:15:08,unsteddyphoenix,"The head thing feels so slow, but I thought maybe it was the best way anyway"
14-11-2017T23:15:27,CrRAR,Step 1) Practice getting gud
14-11-2017T23:15:31,CrRAR,Step 2) be gud Step
14-11-2017T23:15:34,CrRAR,3) Repeat
14-11-2017T23:15:44,unsteddyphoenix,Wise~
14-11-2017T23:15:45,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Step 4) never stop step 1
14-11-2017T23:16:22,Twokinds,Hate to say it but it really is just practice
14-11-2017T23:16:51,MarvTheHugPharaoh,practice makes beautiful
14-11-2017T23:16:54,CrRAR,never stop never stopping
14-11-2017T23:17:38,Twokinds,"I'm not the fastest learner out there. I'm not like, naturally gifted. It just took years. I think it took more than a decade before Twokinds art got to a point I was happy with."
14-11-2017T23:18:06,midnight777,Wait quick question 6 pm eastern right
14-11-2017T23:18:09,unsteddyphoenix,"Well, you were pretty young for a lot of that."
