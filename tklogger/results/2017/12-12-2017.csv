12-12-2017T12:49:52,TheBeckoner,Welp Unfortunately I just took my math final. The unfortunate thing is I didnt finish like 45% of the test so I'm pretty sure I failed.
12-12-2017T12:56:52,qwe304,what level of math?
12-12-2017T12:59:14,TheBeckoner,"I'm a freshman so college algebra, I guess it should be easy but I suck at it apparently."
12-12-2017T13:02:48,qwe304,did you have a calculator?
12-12-2017T13:03:49,TheBeckoner,yup
12-12-2017T13:04:49,TheBeckoner,"I had everything I needed to do well, its just I didnt go over enough material because I got like halfway through and started seein stuff I hadnt gone over recently and couldnt remember what to do."
12-12-2017T13:05:44,qwe304,"for algebra, you can solve like 70 by graphing"
12-12-2017T13:05:50,qwe304,*70%
12-12-2017T13:05:57,qwe304,least the course i took
12-12-2017T13:07:57,TheBeckoner,"Well you can get some really solid direction from graphing, but in this course it rarely gives you an answer to a non-graphing problem."
12-12-2017T13:08:25,TheBeckoner,"plus the dude teaching it is kinda picky and often makes us do problems in ""his"" way"
12-12-2017T13:09:21,qwe304,"ah, so not multiple choice questions"
12-12-2017T13:09:59,TheBeckoner,"Some were, but no the majority of the test was not"
12-12-2017T13:10:17,TheBeckoner,are you in college?
12-12-2017T13:12:57,qwe304,"o lol,"
12-12-2017T13:13:09,qwe304,i thought you meant fresman in HS
12-12-2017T13:14:14,TheBeckoner,nope
12-12-2017T13:14:34,TheBeckoner,in college...makes failing this test even more shameful
12-12-2017T13:18:09,qwe304,"im in a calculus course right now, dual credit"
12-12-2017T13:18:19,qwe304,(im a HS junior)
12-12-2017T13:20:30,TheBeckoner,Nice. I'm starting to reconsider pursuing a career with math lol You seem like you got it though to be doing calculus
12-12-2017T13:20:37,Devlfry,Hey guys

12-12-2017T13:22:40,Devlfry,"I just got home from college, I'm dying of sleep"
12-12-2017T13:29:15,qwe304,im considering an engineering degree
12-12-2017T13:30:06,qwe304,i drew a winner for my giveaway but they havent responded to the email i sent

12-12-2017T14:51:37,RandomTKLover,"Where I’m at it’s 23 outside, and it feels like nine because of the windchill."
12-12-2017T14:51:45,RandomTKLover,I just wasn’t having that
12-12-2017T15:06:07,qwe304,sweating in 23 weather? C or F?
12-12-2017T15:08:30,Devlfry,Here in Brazil it's making 43 ° C in my city

12-12-2017T16:05:45,MidnightBlue78,"Tom, how have you been? :)"
12-12-2017T16:05:50,Twokinds,Do you think it would be weird to buy a house you used to live in?
12-12-2017T16:06:07,Bgrmystr2,"I don't, but maybe I'm weird."
12-12-2017T16:06:10,Bgrmystr2,I grew up there though
12-12-2017T16:06:21,MidnightBlue78,I don't think it would be
12-12-2017T16:06:26,Twokinds,I've actually wanted to do just that. Or at least the same old neighborhood.
12-12-2017T16:06:29,Bgrmystr2,most of my first memories are from that house :(
12-12-2017T16:06:34,MidnightBlue78,I think it would be awesome imo
12-12-2017T16:06:43,Bgrmystr2,"not my first two, but the rest of em sure."
12-12-2017T16:07:13,MidnightBlue78,I thought you lived in your  childhood home Tom..

12-12-2017T16:26:44,MidnightBlue78,hi~
12-12-2017T16:27:39,Devlfry,everything is fine here?
12-12-2017T16:28:45,Devlfry,I'm trying to learn new words in English
12-12-2017T16:33:52,MidnightBlue78,"Everything is as good as its gunna get, apparently"
12-12-2017T16:34:38,Devlfry,okay
12-12-2017T16:35:47,MidnightBlue78,how are you @Devlfry?
12-12-2017T16:37:02,Devlfry,"Well, just dying of HEAT."

12-12-2017T16:39:35,Devlfry,But now is a little more bearable  xD
12-12-2017T16:39:58,Devlfry,I'm creating new Fursonas
12-12-2017T16:41:20,MidnightBlue78,"Again, thank you so much for mine"
12-12-2017T16:41:49,Twokinds,"No, I don't live in my childhood home."
12-12-2017T16:42:11,MidnightBlue78,"I never thought anyone would ever make one for me, although I've never considered having a fursona"
12-12-2017T16:43:32,Devlfry,"All right, I'm glad you enjoyed it, I'm making better ones when I make another one a little better, I'll tell you"

12-12-2017T16:44:53,Devlfry,My childhood home and a village in Patagonia Argentina
12-12-2017T16:45:31,RandomTKLover,How did you find tom?
12-12-2017T16:45:49,MidnightBlue78,I've moved so much in my entire lifetime :(
12-12-2017T16:46:02,MidnightBlue78,I'm sick of moving
12-12-2017T16:46:35,MidnightBlue78,"But, I could really move out of this shithole I live in now"
12-12-2017T16:47:34,Twokinds,We didn't have a lot of money growing up around that time. Our family eventually lost the home I grew up in and moved to a townhouse when I was around 12.
12-12-2017T16:47:34,Devlfry,"Now, remembering the village where I lived, I felt like a Keidran, I hunted with my father and played in the forest with my old friends 1995 xD"
12-12-2017T16:49:00,MidnightBlue78,that's really sad Tom
12-12-2017T16:49:00,RandomTKLover,How old are you?:ptv-confused:
12-12-2017T16:49:08,Twokinds,30!
12-12-2017T16:49:23,MidnightBlue78,you so old Tom!!!!
12-12-2017T16:49:27,Devlfry,I was born in 1993
12-12-2017T16:49:33,Twokinds,I know ;-;
12-12-2017T16:49:35,TheBeckoner,"I have only moved once when I was 17, from my first house to this one now."
12-12-2017T16:49:46,MidnightBlue78,I'm older :3
12-12-2017T16:49:53,Devlfry,xD
12-12-2017T16:50:01,TheBeckoner,Didnt you move around quite a bit Tom?
12-12-2017T16:50:16,Twokinds,Yeah for a while
12-12-2017T16:50:26,MidnightBlue78,"hey Tom, wanna go to the senior center to play bingo and drink prune juice??? lol"
12-12-2017T16:50:31,TheBeckoner,lol
12-12-2017T16:50:42,RandomTKLover,So I’m like the youngest one here.
12-12-2017T16:50:44,TheBeckoner,hes only half old
12-12-2017T16:50:47,Twokinds,"It was sad at the time. Though weirdly, some of my fondest memories are during the most difficult times."
12-12-2017T16:50:47,MidnightBlue78,I hear their puddings really good
12-12-2017T16:50:53,Twokinds,Is that weird?
12-12-2017T16:51:16,MidnightBlue78,"no, it's not"
12-12-2017T16:51:18,RandomTKLover,"Idk, maybe not?"
12-12-2017T16:51:23,Devlfry,I think not
12-12-2017T16:51:29,TheBeckoner,Thats probably because even more medicore things semm really special in hard time since everything else seems bad at the time.
12-12-2017T16:51:35,MidnightBlue78,The happiest I've been was when I was little
12-12-2017T16:51:36,Diskas,no it isn´t. hi btw
12-12-2017T16:51:37,TheBeckoner,seem*
12-12-2017T16:51:48,MidnightBlue78,And we didn't have much either
12-12-2017T16:51:59,Bgrmystr2,the reason you remember that is cuz the happier memories are more of a statement when they're surrounded by not-so-happy ones.
12-12-2017T16:52:03,TheBeckoner,I hope that made since lol this keyboard sucks for typing
12-12-2017T16:52:10,MidnightBlue78,my family was pretty dysfunctional
12-12-2017T16:52:14,TheBeckoner,yeah what bgr said lol
12-12-2017T16:52:19,Twokinds,We didn't have a lot. I have a picture of us from a very pathetic Christmas around a not-even-pine-tree. But I have strange nostalgia around those days.
12-12-2017T16:52:22,Devlfry,I remember when I fell from a tree and broke my leg xD my best memories
12-12-2017T16:52:37,Bgrmystr2,"was it a charlie brown tree, Tom?"
12-12-2017T16:52:48,Bgrmystr2,that poor thing.. xD
12-12-2017T16:53:03,RandomTKLover,"I have such a horrible memory, I can barely remember last Christmas"
12-12-2017T16:53:05,MidnightBlue78,maybe bc you know that your parents were doing the best they could to keep things as normal as possible
12-12-2017T16:53:21,Twokinds,I think it was just a fake tree we had in our house anyway.
12-12-2017T16:53:39,TheBeckoner,My parents grew up without much in abusive houses and worked really hard so me and my sister could do well.
12-12-2017T16:53:42,Twokinds,"But yeah, my dad did everything he could to make sure we still lived well dispite it."
12-12-2017T16:54:18,TheBeckoner,From what mark has described Tom your dad seemed like a cool guy
12-12-2017T16:54:27,MidnightBlue78,those are the things that make you value him so much
12-12-2017T16:54:29,Twokinds,I know now it must have stressed him out a lot.
12-12-2017T16:54:38,Devlfry,"my father never cared much for me, and for my part I never asked for his acceptance, when I said that he was doing a course design he said that it is ""pathetic"""
12-12-2017T16:54:45,MidnightBlue78,"yes, it must have"
12-12-2017T16:55:16,TheBeckoner,"It probably did, but at the same time he was probably happy to make you as happy as he could"
12-12-2017T16:56:02,RandomTKLover,"Tom, how are you doing life-wise.  Didn’t you go to college to become a radiologist or something?"
12-12-2017T16:57:42,Twokinds,Everything is awesome~

12-12-2017T19:52:53,MasamotoTakeshi,;-;
12-12-2017T19:52:55,Devlfry,MEU pt ngn intende vlw ?
12-12-2017T19:52:58,Twokinds,It is due to lack of sunlight.
12-12-2017T19:53:07,Twokinds,I have been considering getting a mobile drawing tablet.
12-12-2017T19:53:17,Twokinds,But I don't like what's currently on the market right now.
12-12-2017T19:53:48,TheBeckoner,If you could get a full color tablet that used that paper like screen it would be perfect for outdoor drawing...I think
12-12-2017T19:54:06,Twokinds,heheh if only
12-12-2017T19:54:36,BadFoMo,//Troll What's wrong with paper and pencil?
12-12-2017T19:54:38,MidnightBlue78,"That would be really awesome if you could take it everywhere and draw, draw, draw..."
12-12-2017T19:54:51,MidnightBlue78,are they too pricey?
12-12-2017T19:54:55,Twokinds,Yeah.
12-12-2017T19:55:02,Twokinds,In the 2000's range
12-12-2017T19:55:02,TheDixieNutjob,"I'll tell ya this, they are expensive as hooey"
12-12-2017T19:55:16,Twokinds,And Wacom's Mobilestudios are known to be really buggy.
12-12-2017T19:55:17,MidnightBlue78,crap
12-12-2017T19:55:34,TheDixieNutjob,and let's not even mention the apps for regular tablets...
12-12-2017T19:55:41,Devlfry,So imagine Brazil 3 times more money
12-12-2017T19:55:44,MidnightBlue78,holy shit ...2000
12-12-2017T19:55:47,TheDixieNutjob,most of them aren't worth a crap
12-12-2017T19:56:04,TheDixieNutjob,and the tablets don't really have pressure sensitivity
12-12-2017T19:56:29,Devlfry,"That would be R$ 6,000"
12-12-2017T19:56:31,TheDixieNutjob,of course you could get a laptop and get an intuos
12-12-2017T19:56:49,TheDixieNutjob,then you can do it at a park table
12-12-2017T19:57:17,TheBeckoner,I use an intuos cause I aint got 1k for anything better lol
12-12-2017T19:57:57,Twokinds,It's really just more about the lack of offerings.
12-12-2017T19:58:06,Twokinds,I'm hoping next year Wacom comes out with some new hardware.
12-12-2017T19:58:07,TheDixieNutjob,"oh that's nothing, I still use my bamboo"
12-12-2017T19:58:32,TheBeckoner,If only Nvidia was interesting in the drawing market...
12-12-2017T19:58:45,Devlfry,gtx 1070

12-12-2017T20:08:19,OnliStanding,but the gtx 1070 ti hasnt been released on laptops
12-12-2017T20:08:40,Devlfry,truth
12-12-2017T20:08:53,OnliStanding,so why not just call the gtx 1080 max q which also already exists the gtx 1070 ti for laptops
12-12-2017T20:09:04,Devlfry,"I'm going to the bathroom, I'm going back."
12-12-2017T20:09:16,OnliStanding,kk

12-12-2017T20:17:47,TheDixieNutjob,"I've already graduated college, mwahahahahahaaa"
12-12-2017T20:17:48,Dadrobit,And then one more semester...
12-12-2017T20:17:57,Dadrobit,Acting.
12-12-2017T20:18:11,Dadrobit,"Written test, and then a scene performance."
12-12-2017T20:18:38,TheBeckoner,Ah I see. I would 100% fail. I hate doing stuff in front of people
12-12-2017T20:18:53,DarkLinnk,scene performance ? what is that final for ?
12-12-2017T20:19:07,TheBeckoner,Acting he said
12-12-2017T20:19:19,Dadrobit,"Meh, the way I see it, if I screw up, at least I'm doing it in front of a person who likely knows how to fix it."
12-12-2017T20:20:35,TheBeckoner,Well that's a way to look at it I suppose. Wouldnt your grade go down anyway though?
12-12-2017T20:20:40,Dadrobit,That and I've had a fair shake of charisma since middle school. Not always though lol. I remember being in a play and crying on stage because of stage fright and forgetting my lines.
12-12-2017T20:20:59,TheBeckoner,"Oh dang, I just freeze up"
12-12-2017T20:21:49,Dadrobit,I'm really not worried. Last two performances I got a 98% and a 99% on. I got docked for my hair covering up too much of my face.
12-12-2017T20:22:13,unsteddyphoenix,hahaha what
12-12-2017T20:22:18,Dadrobit,The 98 I got docked for not making the most of the physical space.
12-12-2017T20:22:30,unsteddyphoenix,hair on your face
12-12-2017T20:22:41,TheBeckoner,Like facial hair or head hair?
12-12-2017T20:22:54,unsteddyphoenix,Im mimagine daddy emo fringe
12-12-2017T20:23:13,Dadrobit,"My hair is just long enough to cover my eyes, so in a profile view the audience loses a fair bit of my facial expressions."
12-12-2017T20:23:32,unsteddyphoenix,"""that gorgeous face shouldnt be kept hidden -1 point"""
12-12-2017T20:23:39,Dadrobit,"True dat.,"
12-12-2017T20:24:45,TheBeckoner,"lol I have pretty long curly hair, Id be screwed"
12-12-2017T20:25:24,Dadrobit,"It was because I was warned about it in my practice run and didn't do anything to fix it in the final. But it's not long enough to ponytail, I don't know how to use clips, and I refuse to let gel or hairspray anywhere near this mane."
12-12-2017T20:27:25,TheBeckoner,lol
12-12-2017T20:27:53,Dadrobit,"And the scene I'm doing tomorrow, (I'm a psychiatrist who becomes utterly captivated by the thought of the butt of his client's mother) I have down pat."
12-12-2017T20:27:56,unsteddyphoenix,what a conundrum
12-12-2017T20:28:34,TheBeckoner,haha is there a name for that scene?
12-12-2017T20:29:00,DarkLinnk,understandable
12-12-2017T20:29:57,Combak,"Sounds like SAD really got to ya, huh @Twokinds?"
12-12-2017T20:30:08,TheDixieNutjob,"well, there's something you don't see everyday"
12-12-2017T20:30:55,MetalAppleSauce,Which?
12-12-2017T20:31:50,TheDixieNutjob,the scene dadrobit just explained
12-12-2017T20:32:06,Twokinds,More like Year-Round Affective Disorder
12-12-2017T20:32:26,Twokinds,Or YeRAD!
12-12-2017T20:32:32,Twokinds,It's less exciting than it sounds
12-12-2017T20:32:35,unsteddyphoenix,Could be better
12-12-2017T20:32:40,unsteddyphoenix,haha

12-12-2017T20:34:18,MetalAppleSauce,Yeah that
12-12-2017T20:34:45,MidnightBlue78,"yeah, it really isn't exciting at all"

12-12-2017T20:39:15,Dadrobit,Just a good old fashioned parody.
12-12-2017T20:41:41,TheDixieNutjob,"okay, good"

12-12-2017T21:03:53,Supahbuzzer,welcome to the losers club

12-12-2017T21:05:04,RandomTKLover,"Maybe, im here alot"
12-12-2017T21:05:05,BadFoMo,//Troll Tonic?
12-12-2017T21:05:06,ZizzoGaming,"Ok, cause it was starting to sound like maybe it was a sketch stream"
12-12-2017T21:05:22,Combak,"Lynn, Maddie, Sealeen, Landen, Eric, Kat, Evals, Mike, and Rose are all still back at the manor."
12-12-2017T21:05:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"hope to see Zenny, I need to know if my baby boy is at least alive"
12-12-2017T21:05:28,Dadrobit,Cutaway to Daniels and 37 waking up
12-12-2017T21:05:28,TheDixieNutjob,"not here, I feel like i've seen you elsewhere"
12-12-2017T21:05:35,RandomTKLover,And the two chickens
12-12-2017T21:05:48,Combak,"... Man, that really makes you think about how many characters there are in TK."
12-12-2017T21:05:50,ZizzoGaming,We don't know what they are yet TK
12-12-2017T21:06:01,TheDixieNutjob,maybe on DA
12-12-2017T21:06:01,ZizzoGaming,Might not be chickens/hens
12-12-2017T21:06:08,Dadrobit,"Zen is fine. Called it before, again now. When the bandage comes off, his leg will be almost if not entirely healed."
12-12-2017T21:06:10,MetalAppleSauce,"Marv, he's a main character, of course he's still alive"
12-12-2017T21:06:21,MetalAppleSauce,If Natani's alive then zen is
12-12-2017T21:06:25,unsteddyphoenix,There's a lot yeah

12-12-2017T21:06:49,unsteddyphoenix,broken characte
12-12-2017T21:07:03,Dadrobit,It'll bring forth the revelation that she's more powerful than they all realized.
12-12-2017T21:07:09,Dadrobit,even more*
12-12-2017T21:07:11,Combak,"I mean, really, I thought most of the cast was now in one group, but after listing them off it seems that the cast is evenly split."
12-12-2017T21:07:21,Supahbuzzer,raine's gonna have to shapeshift unintentionally if she gets attacked by natani by putting that inhibitor on zenny boy
12-12-2017T21:07:21,RandomTKLover,Wait no because they hid when renni showed up
12-12-2017T21:07:30,DarkLinnk,Rain needs a nerf ;D
12-12-2017T21:07:33,ZizzoGaming,So my government teacher is making us do an assignment on Net Neutrality. Very informative
12-12-2017T21:07:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Raine is the Goku of TK
12-12-2017T21:07:48,BadFoMo,@Dadrobit Like Tetsuo form Akira?

12-12-2017T21:09:07,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I don't see raine turning into a giant boiled potato any time soon
12-12-2017T21:09:08,Dadrobit,"Marv, I'm like the Anti-Weeb and even I respect Akira"
12-12-2017T21:09:08,Supahbuzzer,what if raine became clovis' apprentice?
12-12-2017T21:09:12,BadFoMo,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akira_(1988_film)

12-12-2017T21:10:18,unsteddyphoenix,what a url
12-12-2017T21:10:26,RandomTKLover,We laughed so hard
12-12-2017T21:10:44,ZizzoGaming,It bypasses a bunch of sublinks on the FCC's webpage to take you to where you need to go.
12-12-2017T21:10:50,DarkLinnk,I though it was a joke in the r/pcmasterrace
12-12-2017T21:10:54,BadFoMo,@MarvTheHugPharaoh What about a sketch request of Raine dressed like Tetsuo and with a power crazy look on her face?
12-12-2017T21:10:59,ZizzoGaming,"Also, thank John Oliver for that url"
12-12-2017T21:11:12,Dadrobit,Forewarning: Any automated system that sends the same message to the FCC with jusrt a different name attached they throw out on the assumption that it was sent by a botter.
12-12-2017T21:11:20,Combak,Why'd you ping Marv FoMo?
12-12-2017T21:11:21,Dadrobit,just a *

12-12-2017T21:13:26,BadFoMo,"@Combak He didn't want to see Raine end up like Tetsuo did in the movie, so I though why not before that point."

12-12-2017T21:17:07,RandomTKLover,I reject your reality and substitute my own
12-12-2017T21:17:08,Combak,"Substitute, not replace @unsteddyphoenix."

12-12-2017T22:56:31,HeresyArtStream,I've known Kiit0s long enough by now to recognize his voice at least.
12-12-2017T22:56:47,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"No Mute, must hear baby voice"
12-12-2017T22:56:57,TheBeckoner,Im hecka confused about the voice thing

12-12-2017T22:58:10,HeresyArtStream,I use in-ear monitoring when I voice chat so I know my voice isn't as deep as it sounds to me.
12-12-2017T22:58:11,MidnightBlue78,i hate hearing my recoded voice
12-12-2017T22:58:12,RoloArts,Keith's about ready to get choppy

12-12-2017T23:29:10,HeresyArtStream,"I didn't buy a lot of movies when I was a kid or have cable, but I got to watch 80s reruns and borrow lots of movies from the library."
12-12-2017T23:29:40,BluePhantom90,Tom likes general grievous
12-12-2017T23:29:46,Dadrobit,"Awww man, I remember that. Going to the library to pick out a VHS was the bomb."
12-12-2017T23:29:51,HeresyArtStream,^
12-12-2017T23:29:54,NightMeaty22,Is it bad if i have no friends
12-12-2017T23:29:55,MarvTheHugPharaoh,^
12-12-2017T23:30:01,unsteddyphoenix,I just got books from the library :thinking:
12-12-2017T23:30:01,ZahnHolley,"Sylv is awesome,"
12-12-2017T23:30:13,HeresyArtStream,It's the little things that kids today don't appreciate because they have so much access to entertainment.
12-12-2017T23:30:17,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I alwasy rented a eyewitness movie about dinosaurs
12-12-2017T23:30:31,HeresyArtStream,"When I was a kid, if it wasn't at the library, the only way I'd get to see it was if all the family agreed to rent it on movie night."
12-12-2017T23:30:35,unsteddyphoenix,KIDS these days
12-12-2017T23:30:38,RandomTKLover,Facts heresy
12-12-2017T23:30:44,MidnightBlue78,i didnt have much growing up either
12-12-2017T23:30:50,Bgrmystr2,I think I know two people by Sylv
12-12-2017T23:30:56,Dadrobit,"Usually got books, but sometimes my siblings and I could beg hard enough to let us pick out a movie."
12-12-2017T23:30:59,MarvTheHugPharaoh,my school had this tiny library were they let us check out movies
12-12-2017T23:31:00,MidnightBlue78,but i would be entertained pretty easily
12-12-2017T23:31:15,unsteddyphoenix,growing up in the 90's we at least had seasonal movies and hella cartoons :ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
12-12-2017T23:31:17,Serpentfrog,"""were"" :ctwokinds-keifacepalm:"

12-12-2017T23:31:31,Dadrobit,"Ohhhhh, watch it!"
12-12-2017T23:31:32,TheBeckoner,scary nooo
12-12-2017T23:31:33,HeresyArtStream,Alien is a classic
12-12-2017T23:31:36,MarvTheHugPharaoh,its the best horror movie
12-12-2017T23:31:36,HeresyArtStream,And Aliens
12-12-2017T23:31:41,MarvTheHugPharaoh,^
12-12-2017T23:31:41,HeresyArtStream,make it a double feature
12-12-2017T23:31:42,TheBeckoner,Good movie th
12-12-2017T23:31:44,Bgrmystr2,Keep that to yourself nopenopenope :c

12-12-2017T23:31:49,TheBeckoner,tho*
12-12-2017T23:31:52,unsteddyphoenix,Thats the male pregnancy movie right?
12-12-2017T23:31:55,RandomTKLover,🎵 Running in the 90’s 🎵
12-12-2017T23:31:55,HeresyArtStream,Aliens blew my mind. That was another library pickup.
12-12-2017T23:32:03,MarvTheHugPharaoh,one is horror the other is the most quotable movie of all time
12-12-2017T23:32:05,HeresyArtStream,I actually saw Aliens first.
12-12-2017T23:32:18,Dadrobit,"Got to see them in theatres last year, oh my goodness are they meant to be watched like that."
12-12-2017T23:32:18,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I saw alien before ET
12-12-2017T23:32:19,NightMeaty22,When i was 6 i would put glue on my hands and peel it off and now 6 year olds get smart phones
12-12-2017T23:32:41,Ordithus,:ptv-confused:
12-12-2017T23:32:44,TheBeckoner,When I was 6 I found bugs under rocks
12-12-2017T23:32:44,qwe304,i played with legos as a kid
12-12-2017T23:32:45,MarvTheHugPharaoh,6 year old me should have not had access to a vcr XD
12-12-2017T23:33:01,TheBeckoner,and climbed trees
12-12-2017T23:33:05,HeresyArtStream,Tom probably has a big list of movies people tell him to see like Captain America does. :V
12-12-2017T23:33:06,Ordithus,6 year old me went outside
12-12-2017T23:33:12,TheBeckoner,^
12-12-2017T23:33:23,NightMeaty22,I still play with legos
12-12-2017T23:33:28,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"the rest can wait, Alien first"
12-12-2017T23:33:29,Bgrmystr2,"I know I do, Heresy xD"
12-12-2017T23:33:32,RandomTKLover,I tried to fix my dad’s old walkman when I was 10
12-12-2017T23:33:40,RandomTKLover,I failed
12-12-2017T23:33:53,HeresyArtStream,My list of movies I have to catch up on ended up getting replaced with my video game backlog. T_T
12-12-2017T23:34:00,Dadrobit,I only ruined one tape iirc. I remember my father's belt quite vividly. It was a brass buckle with a unicorn recess and a jewel inlay for the horn.
12-12-2017T23:34:16,HeresyArtStream,"I own hundreds of games but I haven't played all of them, much less finished them."
12-12-2017T23:34:21,TheBeckoner,I tried to fix my dads dewalt drill and failed pretty bad...let the smoke out
12-12-2017T23:34:28,TheBeckoner,whe I was like 12
12-12-2017T23:34:56,HeresyArtStream,Today I found an old Advanced Dungeons & Dragons campaign at Goodwill for $3!
12-12-2017T23:35:04,MarvTheHugPharaoh,neat
12-12-2017T23:35:05,HeresyArtStream,It was in the box and came with everything.
12-12-2017T23:35:07,Dadrobit,I wonder if he still has that belt :pondering:
12-12-2017T23:35:12,Ordithus,cool
12-12-2017T23:35:26,HeresyArtStream,It was totally early 90s because it came with an audio CD that I guess is part of the campaign?
12-12-2017T23:35:33,RandomTKLover,Dad tried
12-12-2017T23:35:37,unsteddyphoenix,thats a nice find
12-12-2017T23:35:57,HeresyArtStream,I also found a boxed copy of 2E D&D for $2 at Savers years ago.
12-12-2017T23:36:07,HeresyArtStream,It goes for like $80 on eBay.
12-12-2017T23:36:25,BluePhantom90,damn should have bought that

12-12-2017T23:37:12,Dadrobit,"Is it like various ambient music to set the tone of the campaign? If so, that's an awesome understanding of using media to set the tone for the time."

12-12-2017T23:38:34,Dadrobit,People are always talking about doing something TK related in some outside form. Come get me when you can show me results.

12-12-2017T23:39:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,there is a TK in the works
12-12-2017T23:39:23,HeresyArtStream,"truth be told I have only played actual ""official"" D&D once. My group has always preferred Pathfinder."

12-12-2017T23:39:31,ZRO4825,Herro thar ^^/
12-12-2017T23:39:51,HeresyArtStream,"Pathfinder is starting to get a bit silly with all the changes they've had to tack on though so we might try out D&D 5E, or switch to Starfinder for a while."
12-12-2017T23:39:59,BluJax,Same here Pathfinder or the GURPS system
12-12-2017T23:40:00,HeresyArtStream,The Pathfinder core book is about due for a revision.
12-12-2017T23:40:09,Kamaro12,I need to get in an rpg group

12-12-2017T23:40:39,MarvTheHugPharaoh,and she has red hair
12-12-2017T23:40:42,HeresyArtStream,My favorite game to DM is Savage Worlds just because it's so open ended and I can make a campaign around just about any setting.
12-12-2017T23:40:56,ZahnHolley,Goodnight guys thanks for stream tom
12-12-2017T23:41:05,Sammit,Bye Zahn
12-12-2017T23:41:09,HeresyArtStream,"It's a bit easier to pick up and learn than the D20 system or GURPS, too."

12-12-2017T23:41:44,unsteddyphoenix,How else would he respond?
12-12-2017T23:41:45,Ordithus,Savage Worlds was my first RPG system.  I think it was a good way to get into rpgs
12-12-2017T23:41:50,HeresyArtStream,^
12-12-2017T23:42:03,HeresyArtStream,If someone has never played an RPG Savage Worlds is the one I recommend.

12-12-2017T23:43:02,Twokinds,I'm in a Savage Worlds game right now.

12-12-2017T23:43:36,unsteddyphoenix,Ayy im playing a monk right now
12-12-2017T23:43:37,HeresyArtStream,It's super easy to create races in Savage Worlds.
12-12-2017T23:43:55,unsteddyphoenix,"They start off ok, they can use their bonus action immediately so"
12-12-2017T23:44:06,qwe304,@ZizzoGaming an attempt was made...
12-12-2017T23:44:08,CrimsonHelsing,"easy, or too simplified?"
12-12-2017T23:44:26,HeresyArtStream,There's an open-source Fallout RPG system that I am curious about.
12-12-2017T23:44:37,MarvTheHugPharaoh,the amount of yugioh in this stream pleases me :)
12-12-2017T23:44:39,HeresyArtStream,SW is simple and easy.
12-12-2017T23:44:51,HeresyArtStream,"Like, it's not as deep as D&D but it's very fast and accessible."
12-12-2017T23:44:52,Ordithus,"SW can do fantasy, super heros, whatever"
12-12-2017T23:44:57,HeresyArtStream,^
12-12-2017T23:45:29,Ordithus,I kinda want to play now
12-12-2017T23:45:31,HeresyArtStream,Savage Worlds Weird Wars is good fun.
12-12-2017T23:45:34,VenZi,"hey, you guys have taken over the frontpage."
12-12-2017T23:45:42,HeresyArtStream,Tons of WW2 weapons and machines with stats
12-12-2017T23:45:47,unsteddyphoenix,only just now?
12-12-2017T23:45:48,Ordithus,cool
12-12-2017T23:45:57,HeresyArtStream,It's basically like Wolfenstein
12-12-2017T23:45:58,Bgrmystr2,"hmm, I don't recall the name of the song"
12-12-2017T23:46:00,Bgrmystr2,but I know it
12-12-2017T23:46:15,SageSaga,my DnD game finished so we started a Super Hero Scifi game using Savage Worlds
12-12-2017T23:46:23,HeresyArtStream,cool!
12-12-2017T23:46:28,Ordithus,nice!
12-12-2017T23:46:28,HeresyArtStream,One of the things that really attracted me to Savage Worlds was how vehicles work.
12-12-2017T23:46:31,Bgrmystr2,you don't like Undertale music? :o
12-12-2017T23:46:35,unsteddyphoenix,Hoo~ xool
12-12-2017T23:46:37,HeresyArtStream,Vehicle chases and combat in Savage Worlds are fun.
12-12-2017T23:46:53,unsteddyphoenix,So it's a good system? I've never looked into it
12-12-2017T23:47:05,SageSaga,its great and cheap too
12-12-2017T23:47:06,HeresyArtStream,The core book is nice and lean.
12-12-2017T23:47:18,Ordithus,It really just never gets in the way.
12-12-2017T23:47:30,HeresyArtStream,All you need to play is a set of dungeon dice and playing cards.
12-12-2017T23:47:44,HeresyArtStream,A grid mat helps but you can play without one.
12-12-2017T23:47:45,MarvTheHugPharaoh,dungeon dice monsters
12-12-2017T23:48:29,HeresyArtStream,"The books even encourages the DM to improvise for pieces, like using matchbox cars for vehicle chases or coins for large-scale battles."
12-12-2017T23:48:35,unsteddyphoenix,fatecore sounds like a terrible music genre
12-12-2017T23:49:28,TheBeckoner,"I'll be back later, Im gonna shower"
12-12-2017T23:49:45,VenZi,that makes sense to me.
12-12-2017T23:50:33,unsteddyphoenix,No that happens in Dnd too?
12-12-2017T23:50:36,HeresyArtStream,I really want to try Shadowrun sometime because the setting looks really cool.
12-12-2017T23:50:46,HeresyArtStream,Getting a group to try a new RPG can be a bit daunting though.
12-12-2017T23:50:57,unsteddyphoenix,If you roll badly climbing a cliff you could do it while getting injured
12-12-2017T23:51:01,unsteddyphoenix,Or fall off mid climb
12-12-2017T23:51:04,unsteddyphoenix,It's not like nothing happens
12-12-2017T23:51:20,Ordithus,I hope you have lots of d6
12-12-2017T23:51:20,HeresyArtStream,I played 5 Rings once but the guy who DMd kind of sucked any potential fun out of it.
12-12-2017T23:51:28,ZizzoGaming,BRB I gotta go to formation
12-12-2017T23:51:33,Kamaro12,"heresy, lemme know if you ever figure out a group"
12-12-2017T23:51:46,Kamaro12,I haven't really tried any RPGs :P
12-12-2017T23:51:54,unsteddyphoenix,"Ahh I see, so you pick your own punishment?"
12-12-2017T23:51:58,Serpentfrog,Please tell me 5 rings is about dwarves.
12-12-2017T23:52:11,VenZi,"if you roll something that can decide the game, whether your party succeeds or dies, and you ROLL A 1....."
12-12-2017T23:52:14,VenZi,EPIC FAIL.
12-12-2017T23:52:28,unsteddyphoenix,Ahh like Call of Cthulu
12-12-2017T23:52:32,HeresyArtStream,So far I've only played RPGs with IRL groups. Maybe sometime I'll give an online one a try though.
12-12-2017T23:52:39,VenZi,sometimes the DM decides and it can be hilarious.
12-12-2017T23:52:43,SageSaga,Shadowrun is one of my all time favorites but it is super complex and takes people really familiar with the world
12-12-2017T23:53:04,unsteddyphoenix,D6 stripes
12-12-2017T23:53:12,HeresyArtStream,Sage yeah that's what I worry about with it.
12-12-2017T23:53:23,Serpentfrog,Shadowrun is pretty good.
12-12-2017T23:53:34,Ordithus,I'm playing a heavily modified shadowrun
12-12-2017T23:53:35,HeresyArtStream,It might be a bit too much for our group to chew through unless we can play it on for dummies mode or whatever.
12-12-2017T23:53:46,HeresyArtStream,At least initially.
12-12-2017T23:54:06,Ordithus,It's actually combined with Battletech
12-12-2017T23:54:07,SageSaga,use Interface Zero
12-12-2017T23:54:34,SageSaga,Savage Worlds Cyber Punk - Interface Zero - add magic and races- done- you have Shadowrun
12-12-2017T23:54:39,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"you could be streaming too, Edge"
12-12-2017T23:54:42,HeresyArtStream,"5 Rings seems like it's probably a good system, but our DM basically demanded we all act like we were in feudal Japan and be super polite and respectful to every NPC we interacted with and it just got aggravating."
12-12-2017T23:54:54,Ezedger,"Azeroth, hmmm I have 6 max level chars"
12-12-2017T23:54:56,Ezedger,I need more
12-12-2017T23:55:29,SageSaga,Japan wasnt really like that back then - you only respected your superior and in certain settings
12-12-2017T23:55:46,HeresyArtStream,Yeah but our DM was a know-it-all.
12-12-2017T23:56:22,SageSaga,most important rule of RPGs- the rule of cool
12-12-2017T23:56:27,VenZi,NOPE.AVI this is not anime.
12-12-2017T23:56:28,HeresyArtStream,I don't talk to him anymore because everyone got sick of arguing with him about literally everything.
12-12-2017T23:56:36,unsteddyphoenix,agreed sage
12-12-2017T23:56:39,Ordithus,ouch
12-12-2017T23:56:53,Twokinds,Ink done. Hungry.
12-12-2017T23:56:55,Twokinds,Food.
12-12-2017T23:56:58,Twokinds,brb
12-12-2017T23:57:04,MarvTheHugPharaoh,have fun Tom
12-12-2017T23:57:05,RandomTKLover,Have fun
12-12-2017T23:57:06,HeresyArtStream,"Also, he moved away so he started arguing with everyone on Facebook instead of IRL."
12-12-2017T23:57:06,SageSaga,used to play with a guy who when he DMed he felt it was his job to kill the party
12-12-2017T23:57:11,BadFoMo,Oh! Silent Hill Theme!
12-12-2017T23:57:11,Bgrmystr2,Looks nice tom :D
12-12-2017T23:57:19,HeresyArtStream,Enjoy your munchies Tom!
12-12-2017T23:57:21,TheBeckoner,Loookin good so far Tom
12-12-2017T23:57:22,unsteddyphoenix,quitter!
12-12-2017T23:57:34,Bgrmystr2,"Also, Kiit0s this looks real nice dude"
12-12-2017T23:57:37,SageSaga,he started making every encounter have anti-characters- characters designed specifically to kill certain people in the party
12-12-2017T23:57:37,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"don't stop, your on a roll"
12-12-2017T23:57:42,RheyareZeta,Great job with this so far Kiit0s
12-12-2017T23:58:03,Ordithus,"wow, sage."
12-12-2017T23:58:04,Serpentfrog,What about his on a roll?
12-12-2017T23:58:07,HeresyArtStream,If I am running a campaign where character death is likely I will warn people far in advance and tell them to roll up multiple characters.
12-12-2017T23:58:10,unsteddyphoenix,oo nice kiit
12-12-2017T23:58:17,MarvTheHugPharaoh,That is adorable Kiit
12-12-2017T23:58:33,Ordithus,Kitty! :ptv-excited:
12-12-2017T23:58:36,MidnightBlue78,looks great Kiit
12-12-2017T23:58:37,HeresyArtStream,Lovely! :ok_hand:
12-12-2017T23:58:40,Ezedger,&lt;3
12-12-2017T23:58:54,Sammit,it looks very good
12-12-2017T23:59:31,Dadrobit,"Anytime I think of player killing, I think back to a bit with Matt Mercer where one of his players insulted him, so he looked at the camera and said, ""And in my next video on How To DM, we'l be talking about dealing with PK!"""
12-12-2017T23:59:39,Bgrmystr2,gotta mess with our wireless network brb
