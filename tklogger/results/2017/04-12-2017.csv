04-12-2017T20:44:42,Combak,"It's melanistic, not albino."
04-12-2017T21:05:43,TheBeckoner,Did you know leopards are considered small cats and are easily domesticated? That's why they keep them as pets in the east.
04-12-2017T21:06:06,TheBeckoner,Sorry I ment cheetahs not leopards
04-12-2017T21:23:54,TheJashter,Not so small looking to me.
04-12-2017T21:24:15,Combak,"I'm not so sure on the domestication bit, but I do know that cheetahs aren't exactly cats. They have more than a few dog-like features."

04-12-2017T22:01:36,iZute,Yea! when i first started reading the comic i was ike not bad but i then became insanly hooked not only with the story but the artstyle as well
04-12-2017T22:01:50,iZute,insanely*
04-12-2017T22:02:06,TheBeckoner,yea the art at the beginning of the comic vs the now is pretty crazy
04-12-2017T22:02:07,Dinoman515,Same thing happened to mostly everyone who tunes into his streams.
04-12-2017T22:02:42,iZute,what i think is funny is a read from start to most recent update in one day
04-12-2017T22:03:00,iZute,i bindged that hardcore
04-12-2017T22:03:08,MidnightBlue78,you sure did
04-12-2017T22:03:20,Dinoman515,I think the sad thing is that I read all 976 pages in two days... :^) Not sayin' its bad though.

04-12-2017T22:06:26,Dinoman515,Im still supprized that Tom has been able to stay dedicated enough with his comics that hes been doing this for 14 years... üëç and a ‚ù§ to Tom for that.
04-12-2017T22:06:35,TheBeckoner,I read to the 2012 mark in 2012 then read some again in 2013 and only recently I just read from 2013 to current last night.
04-12-2017T22:07:51,iZute,i know! 14 years is a long time to be doing anything
04-12-2017T22:07:53,TheJashter,"Same. I remember the two days I spent in 2015 binging Twokinds. Been lurking since, and have loved it. Props to Tom for the wonderful world he shares within his art."
04-12-2017T22:09:36,TheBeckoner,"The most amazing to me is that all of this comic came straight out of his head lol idk if i have the mental capacity to make a huge story like this, let alone stay committed for 14 years AND make art."
04-12-2017T22:09:58,iZute,amen to that
04-12-2017T22:10:35,MidnightBlue78,"it truly is, i have to agree with you on that Beckoner"
