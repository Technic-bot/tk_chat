13-12-2017T00:51:44,SpotTheLeopard,So what you're telling me is that the basitin species is simply the species of sentient beards?
13-12-2017T00:51:44,Serpentfrog,"He's a good man, he's a dark man."
13-12-2017T00:52:07,Dadrobit,"Randal, the dead architect, but close, Serp."

13-12-2017T00:53:22,RandomTKLover,Did anyone else notice the master spy on the bastion islands?
13-12-2017T00:53:24,CrimsonHelsing,"he was an idiot that needed to be stopped. he would have brought back the old Trace and... well, game over"
13-12-2017T00:53:25,Ordithus,"That's a badass Rose you've got there, heresy"

13-12-2017T00:53:59,HeresyArtStream,I recently got premium and I've been making custom emotes.

13-12-2017T00:54:22,RandomTKLover,"Oh, I meant before that"
13-12-2017T00:54:26,CrimsonHelsing,"ah the master spy, still a wild card as far as I can tell"
13-12-2017T00:54:45,unsteddyphoenix,He has some schemes probably
13-12-2017T00:54:45,CrimsonHelsing,dare I say maybe even a loose cannon
13-12-2017T00:54:55,CrimsonHelsing,like a freelancer
13-12-2017T00:55:22,Dadrobit,"Yeah, he was a tavern keeper or somesuch?"

13-12-2017T00:56:07,unsteddyphoenix,If youve made it to the streams you proooobably know all the times he's popped up
13-12-2017T00:56:20,RandomTKLover,I think he wants trace back as grand templar
13-12-2017T00:56:51,Combak,"Well, he was around before Trace, so..."
13-12-2017T00:57:01,unsteddyphoenix,He's probably working for someone.
13-12-2017T00:57:01,Ordithus,Raine is barefoot.
13-12-2017T00:57:12,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"he was all like ""Trace was a good boss, I want him back"""

13-12-2017T00:57:15,Ordithus,Where did you leave your shoes?
13-12-2017T00:57:21,Dadrobit,"Yeah, seems there was a schism in the upper ranks with Euchre and Sirus remaining loyal to varying degrees."
13-12-2017T00:57:35,CrimsonHelsing,"the spy definitely has an agenda. he seemed to have planned a lot of what happened, or at least had involvement in it"
13-12-2017T00:58:01,Dadrobit,"Actually, I have that reversed."
13-12-2017T00:58:22,Dadrobit,"They want him in power, but they want him different."
13-12-2017T00:58:44,funnyman42,"Well, goodnight everyone.  I have to prep my dress uniform for tomorrow's change of command thing.  I'll see you guys later."
13-12-2017T00:58:49,CrimsonHelsing,they don't want a genocidal maniac to lead the guild

13-12-2017T01:00:33,Dadrobit,I'm fairly convinced Chaos has/had hold of Trace at some point. Negated mostly by Neutral.
13-12-2017T01:01:05,Ordithus,Trace is defnitely an unwitting pawn in their duel
13-12-2017T01:01:11,RandomTKLover,"I think that is what black mana is,"
13-12-2017T01:01:22,DontuDare,Clap
13-12-2017T01:01:25,HeresyArtStream,I have made an absolutely dreadful emote.
13-12-2017T01:01:30,MarvTheHugPharaoh,do show
13-12-2017T01:01:34,HeresyArtStream,Yawg is gonna love it though.
13-12-2017T01:01:35,unsteddyphoenix,Very obvious to us who it's intentionally made obvious to.
13-12-2017T01:01:35,RandomTKLover,Just chaos’ version of mana
13-12-2017T01:01:41,HeresyArtStream,:cheresyartstream-sonichu:
13-12-2017T01:01:45,MarvTheHugPharaoh,amazing
13-12-2017T01:01:47,unsteddyphoenix,Nani the fuck.
13-12-2017T01:01:58,CrimsonHelsing,"perhaps... what if this was an elaborated plan by Order to stabilize the situation over time? in essence... the ""Master Spy"" IS Order, perhaps"
13-12-2017T01:01:58,Kamaro12,heresy: blankachu?
13-12-2017T01:02:00,Combak,lol
13-12-2017T01:02:40,Bgrmystr2,xD That's great Heresy
13-12-2017T01:02:48,Dinoman515,You're still streaming! Nice!
13-12-2017T01:02:51,Bgrmystr2,That gif is even further beyond.
13-12-2017T01:03:00,Dadrobit,Bomb ass gif yo
13-12-2017T01:03:25,Ordithus,"Nah.  In the fight with Neutral, Sirius and Euchre weren't supposed to interfere by some weird rules"
13-12-2017T01:03:47,Ordithus,So I don't think Sirius is Order.
13-12-2017T01:03:53,RandomTKLover,"If I had to write out my whole theory on the TK plot, it would take about an hour"
13-12-2017T01:03:56,CrimsonHelsing,good point.
13-12-2017T01:03:58,Dinoman515,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
13-12-2017T01:04:10,iZute,k we back and ready for bisnasty!
13-12-2017T01:04:16,CrimsonHelsing,so who do you think the Master Mage is? (we haven't seen him once) Order or Chaos?
13-12-2017T01:04:33,Combak,"The funny thing is, Chaos wouldn't like Evil Trace. Sure, he's causing wars and stuff, but that's only a short term gain in cause. The end result for Trace winning would be less species on Mekkan, which would make the world more Ordered."
13-12-2017T01:04:46,Combak,gain in *chaos
13-12-2017T01:04:51,unsteddyphoenix,Uhh
13-12-2017T01:05:06,unsteddyphoenix,Made some leaps with that one
13-12-2017T01:05:21,Ordithus,That's entropy you're thinking of
13-12-2017T01:05:46,RandomTKLover,But would  entropy even exist with gods?
13-12-2017T01:05:53,Combak,... Entropy IS literally the measure of the disorder or chaos in a system.
13-12-2017T01:06:13,Ordithus,yay definitions
13-12-2017T01:06:21,RandomTKLover,Entropy is the property of any isolated system to reach a point in which all energy and matter is close to or at the same state
13-12-2017T01:06:55,RandomTKLover,I think I nailed it
13-12-2017T01:07:30,Combak,"No, that's equilibrium."
13-12-2017T01:07:48,Ordithus,They're related.
13-12-2017T01:07:53,Ordithus,Cousins.
13-12-2017T01:07:55,RandomTKLover,No equilibrium is the result that comes after
13-12-2017T01:07:56,Dadrobit,Their names have no meaning in reference to their ideologies. They are simply the names given to them by the humans and each race has their own names.
13-12-2017T01:08:35,Combak,"Actually, I think Tom said they're basically those ""elements"" personified."
13-12-2017T01:08:50,Dadrobit,https://www.twokinds.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=32650#p32650
13-12-2017T01:09:15,Combak,... Ooh.
13-12-2017T01:09:26,Combak,"Then again, that was 12 years ago. :p"
13-12-2017T01:09:39,Dadrobit,"Details, deatails..."
13-12-2017T01:09:45,Dadrobit,details*
13-12-2017T01:09:47,Combak,"Eh, maybe I'm misunderstanding I saw in a stream."
13-12-2017T01:09:50,unsteddyphoenix,"Mm, i'd have to question anything that old"
13-12-2017T01:09:51,Ordithus,Tom never retcons
13-12-2017T01:09:58,Dadrobit,Never
13-12-2017T01:10:33,Ordithus,That's probably still close to the current plot.
13-12-2017T01:10:39,Ordithus,Do note that the names changed.
13-12-2017T01:10:57,Bgrmystr2,"I don't think what's written there, least the important story stuff, has changed much since then"
13-12-2017T01:11:10,Bgrmystr2,least doesn't seem like it
13-12-2017T01:11:18,Combak,"Of course, we haven't touched on that topic, so..."
13-12-2017T01:11:23,unsteddyphoenix,You say that...
13-12-2017T01:12:08,RandomTKLover,But why can’t all three masks/races get along?
13-12-2017T01:12:24,unsteddyphoenix,'cause then the story would end
13-12-2017T01:12:25,Dadrobit,"Behind the masks, they are all cats. That's why"
13-12-2017T01:12:34,MarvTheHugPharaoh,mew
13-12-2017T01:12:35,Combak,THERE CAN OLD BE ONE!

13-12-2017T01:24:01,siergiejew,bye...
13-12-2017T01:24:14,MarvTheHugPharaoh,see ya Siergie
13-12-2017T01:25:03,Dadrobit,"Hey w0lf,just how wiped out are the Arctos? Just mostly dead, or just super dead?"
13-12-2017T01:25:08,Dadrobit,o/ Sie
13-12-2017T01:26:06,w0lfmare,The Tennin haven't seen an Arctos in a long time
13-12-2017T01:26:46,w0lfmare,"But supposedly, there's still some living in the vast catacombs under Sai-vay"
13-12-2017T01:29:33,Dadrobit,"What portion of the population went through the God Scarring? Are those that are left just regular people, or have they survived this long secluded because they were made superior through Death/ one of the artifacts?"
13-12-2017T01:29:40,siergiejew,I was saying bye to those who left &gt;.&gt;
13-12-2017T01:29:51,MarvTheHugPharaoh,&lt;.&lt; oh
13-12-2017T01:29:59,Dadrobit,Welcome back Sie
13-12-2017T01:30:04,w0lfmare,XD
13-12-2017T01:30:46,Ordithus,Awkward
13-12-2017T01:31:08,w0lfmare,"Well, all living Arctos have either a god scarred ancestor, or come from a strong bloodline"
13-12-2017T01:31:59,w0lfmare,"I couldn't fit all the details into the comic, but Death didn't mess with the bloodlines that were already powerful"
13-12-2017T01:32:10,Dadrobit,"Ohhh, so ""The Great War"" was more than a few decades ago then."
13-12-2017T01:32:24,unsteddyphoenix,Woah
13-12-2017T01:32:27,w0lfmare,It went on for a long time
13-12-2017T01:32:33,unsteddyphoenix,I need to catch up on bloodline
13-12-2017T01:32:42,w0lfmare,XD
13-12-2017T01:32:53,Ordithus,The past few comics have contained a lot of lore
13-12-2017T01:33:05,w0lfmare,^
13-12-2017T01:33:05,Dadrobit,"Legit, one of my current favorites. Good stuff man."
13-12-2017T01:33:21,unsteddyphoenix,Lol I see
13-12-2017T01:33:28,unsteddyphoenix,Like I didnt think I was THAT far behind but damn
13-12-2017T01:33:30,unsteddyphoenix,What is this lore
13-12-2017T01:33:44,w0lfmare,There's still so much to explain! I can't wait to get farther into it
13-12-2017T01:34:51,Bgrmystr2,I read the last few pages but ended up getting confused by things. Mainly just.. I have to re-read it again because so many references I just don't recall or remember
13-12-2017T01:36:19,Dadrobit,Been meaning to go back and re-read the whole thing some time.
13-12-2017T01:36:56,w0lfmare,Yeah there's a lot to take in a certain parts
13-12-2017T01:37:10,Kynum,:3
13-12-2017T01:37:20,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Kynum
13-12-2017T01:37:29,Kynum,"sup, Marv!"
13-12-2017T01:37:35,MarvTheHugPharaoh,how are ya?
13-12-2017T01:37:45,Kynum,acceptable :3
13-12-2017T01:37:47,Kynum,Yourself?
13-12-2017T01:37:47,Dadrobit,"Oh, lookit that. Page 2, ""It's been 350 years since the great war."""
13-12-2017T01:37:54,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"i'm good, a bit sleepy to"
13-12-2017T01:37:55,Dadrobit,o/ Ky
13-12-2017T01:38:05,Kynum,"hey, Robit :3"
13-12-2017T01:38:40,w0lfmare,"I like stories that have deep lore though. I enjoy putting the pieces together, and theorizing about the pieces that are missing"
13-12-2017T01:39:37,Dadrobit,Do you read Erfworld? It's like the pinnacle of heavy lore/ missing pieces webcomics.
13-12-2017T01:40:20,w0lfmare,Nope. Got a link?
13-12-2017T01:41:05,Dadrobit,http://www.erfworld.com/
13-12-2017T01:41:20,Dadrobit,DnD based plotline.
13-12-2017T01:41:34,Dadrobit,Dude gets sucked into a world that operates on tabletop rules
13-12-2017T01:43:13,Dadrobit,The level of world and character building details that comic puts into itself is just this side of ludicrous.
13-12-2017T01:43:47,Kamaro12,it definitely grabs your attention with the weird mix of fantasy and modern elements
13-12-2017T01:43:55,w0lfmare,I'll have to check it out
13-12-2017T01:44:09,w0lfmare,"For now, I'm calling it for tonight"
13-12-2017T01:44:11,Kamaro12,reminds me of Homestuck with the amount of text there is
13-12-2017T01:44:14,Kamaro12,not in a bad way though
13-12-2017T01:44:17,Kamaro12,thanks for the stream w0lf

13-12-2017T01:46:13,Dadrobit,"Oh yeahhhhh! Man, I really do need to re-read it."
13-12-2017T01:46:30,w0lfmare,"Yeah, it's been a while since we've seen her XD"
13-12-2017T01:46:33,w0lfmare,Poor Lupa
13-12-2017T01:48:03,Ordithus,Is this the last time?! http://w0lfmare.xepher.net/comic/bloodline-64

13-12-2017T01:49:02,Ordithus,"Over 3 years now.  Well, you aren't as bad as Tom yet :P"
13-12-2017T01:49:34,Dadrobit,D: Approaching Euchre levels of distance to the plot.
13-12-2017T01:50:06,TheBeckoner,To be fair the in story time hasnt been that long
13-12-2017T01:50:08,Ordithus,"Anyways, good night! :ptv-sleepy:"
13-12-2017T01:50:16,TheBeckoner,goodnight

13-12-2017T02:18:07,Bgrmystr2,awww RIP
13-12-2017T02:18:11,Bgrmystr2,I had to leave for a bit
13-12-2017T02:18:29,TheBeckoner,Im here still
13-12-2017T02:18:39,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-sad: Yeah but I missed the end of W0lf's stream
13-12-2017T02:19:16,TheBeckoner,Ohh
13-12-2017T12:33:34,qwe304,is it just me or do toms sketches look better in black?: https://imgur.com/a/I8Wnl
13-12-2017T15:21:27,TheBeckoner,Eh I personally prefer the blue
13-12-2017T15:22:13,TheBeckoner,"also i think I got atleast a B on my chem final, and the teacher said he was gonna round my final grade to an A anyway. So I think Im good"
13-12-2017T16:52:30,RandomTKLover,Id settle for full color
13-12-2017T18:08:33,Bgrmystr2,"Black is just something most people generally look towards. Blue is.. unorthadox, so it's strange. Understandable that some ppl would prefer black"
13-12-2017T18:09:19,Bgrmystr2,"plus, black is easier to fill in colors next to. It won't really blend generally."
13-12-2017T18:44:27,TorqueEmUp,I personally find the blue easier on the eyes
13-12-2017T22:52:16,KuroganeWatanoshi,Hey? Is anyone there?
13-12-2017T22:52:58,CrRAR,"Me! ME! Ooo, oo, I am!"
13-12-2017T22:53:52,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-nibsdance:
13-12-2017T22:56:15,KuroganeWatanoshi,how are you doing? x3
13-12-2017T22:56:38,CrRAR,Just fantastic
13-12-2017T22:56:42,CrRAR,a little tired
13-12-2017T22:56:59,CrRAR,Tomorrow's Friday though!
13-12-2017T22:57:03,CrRAR,Huzzah!
13-12-2017T22:57:29,KuroganeWatanoshi,yeah! That means weekend and a two day break from school!
13-12-2017T22:57:58,KuroganeWatanoshi,I can actually start working on the Flora drawing now as a matter of fact
13-12-2017T22:58:05,KuroganeWatanoshi,I may just do that
13-12-2017T22:59:33,CrRAR,Oh nice.
13-12-2017T23:00:05,CrRAR,the mo' Flora the better as I always say.
13-12-2017T23:00:15,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
13-12-2017T23:00:55,KuroganeWatanoshi,x3 yeah. though I am having a bit of trouble with it xD
13-12-2017T23:01:20,KuroganeWatanoshi,"just doing the general head shape, ears and the eyes... prertty much the entire head"
13-12-2017T23:02:22,TheBeckoner,I am now also here
13-12-2017T23:02:27,KuroganeWatanoshi,Oh hi
13-12-2017T23:02:47,KuroganeWatanoshi,"brb, gonna go brush my teeth"
13-12-2017T23:02:55,CrRAR,Yeah what I don't understand about art styles is how consistent it is between so MANY different poses.
13-12-2017T23:02:58,CrRAR,Ok
13-12-2017T23:03:32,CrRAR,"Like that blows my mind, I mean practicing till you draw one character one particular way, I understand."
13-12-2017T23:04:19,CrRAR,"...but keeping proportions and everything looking and feeling the same comic to comic is wild, to me at least."
13-12-2017T23:04:51,TheBeckoner,well thats what happens when you draw the same things for 10 plus years
13-12-2017T23:04:57,CrRAR,lol
13-12-2017T23:05:00,CrRAR,indeed
13-12-2017T23:05:12,CrRAR,...and evolving all the while. :3
13-12-2017T23:05:43,TheBeckoner,True. Altough Tom improved rather quickly at one point in the comic
13-12-2017T23:06:13,TheBeckoner,I'm not sure what happened at that point
13-12-2017T23:06:33,CrRAR,"Yeah I find sometimes I look back at older comics and go, ""THAT'S WHAT THAT LOOKED LIKE!?"""
13-12-2017T23:07:14,CrRAR,I feel like my imagination automatically imagines older comics in a more recent style somehow.
13-12-2017T23:07:18,CrRAR,haha
13-12-2017T23:07:38,TheBeckoner,haha yeah. I re read TK recently and I kept comparing the website banner and the comic until they matched lol
13-12-2017T23:07:44,TheBeckoner,Yeah mine too!
13-12-2017T23:07:45,CrRAR,haha
13-12-2017T23:08:23,TheBeckoner,I remembered the Alric death pages much better than they actually were lol
13-12-2017T23:08:30,CrRAR,"I think it was just that back whenever as a viewer, you just sit there going ""This can't possibly be any more awesome!"""
13-12-2017T23:08:36,TheBeckoner,when he fell off the bridge
13-12-2017T23:08:37,CrRAR,...then it does.
13-12-2017T23:08:40,CrRAR,Oh yeah
13-12-2017T23:09:04,TheBeckoner,"Yeah youre probably right, and the second time you analyze it more"
13-12-2017T23:09:15,TheBeckoner,alot more*
13-12-2017T23:09:16,CrRAR,"Yeah I feel back then the comic felt ""flatter""."
13-12-2017T23:09:36,TheBeckoner,Right around the middle he discovered shading lol
13-12-2017T23:09:57,CrRAR,yeah
13-12-2017T23:10:04,CrRAR,I think Tom really worked to add depth to backgrounds and upped his shading skills.
13-12-2017T23:10:15,TheBeckoner,Oh for sure.
13-12-2017T23:10:48,CrRAR,mmm
13-12-2017T23:10:50,TheBeckoner,The backgrounds and scenery have grown to be art in themselves and not just a boring passive background.
13-12-2017T23:11:43,CrRAR,"Yeah, when he literally paints the backgrounds (like for the manor), that's dedication right there."
13-12-2017T23:13:05,TheBeckoner,"Oh yeah the zen x raine scene was beautiful, and if you read the natani/clovis side comic you can see how much time he spent on it since the whole comic was inside the manor"
13-12-2017T23:13:27,TheBeckoner,or Noras manor
13-12-2017T23:13:29,KuroganeWatanoshi,And I am back
13-12-2017T23:14:19,TheBeckoner,"Hello Back, I am Beck"
13-12-2017T23:14:43,KuroganeWatanoshi,x3
13-12-2017T23:16:02,CrRAR,wb
13-12-2017T23:17:45,CrRAR,"yeah the interiors and wardrobe styling prolly took ages. Developing new things stylistically is a pretty big investment, let alone time it takes to draw it."
13-12-2017T23:18:20,CrRAR,I mean I'm pretty sure he made custom brushes for the wallpaper and fabrics.
13-12-2017T23:19:16,KuroganeWatanoshi,UGH! WHY IS FLORA'S HAIR SO DIFFICULT TO DRAW!!??!
13-12-2017T23:19:20,TheBeckoner,I wouldn't doubt it
13-12-2017T23:19:34,CrRAR,just make it flowy
13-12-2017T23:19:42,TheBeckoner,At the end of the comic he goes into a little detail about the research he did
13-12-2017T23:20:11,CrRAR,Yeah I love the behind the scenes blurbs
13-12-2017T23:21:31,KuroganeWatanoshi,I just can't wait till I get to draw Keith
13-12-2017T23:21:40,CrRAR,haha
