19-11-2017T13:33:14,MidnightBlue78,hello Wooffin
19-11-2017T13:33:47,Wooffin,How do you do?
19-11-2017T13:34:15,MidnightBlue78,"i'm ok, how about you?"
19-11-2017T13:34:25,Wooffin,Drinking coffee and nomming cereal
19-11-2017T13:34:28,Wooffin,So could be worse
19-11-2017T13:34:57,MidnightBlue78,totally :)
19-11-2017T13:36:50,Wooffin,"Any idea when tom tom may start a stream, if he is feeling better/has his drawing hand on point?"
19-11-2017T13:37:35,MidnightBlue78,"No, no word yet on any of that"
19-11-2017T13:37:41,Wooffin,Okay
19-11-2017T13:51:42,FenceEqualizer,If he's feeling up to it then probably the same time as yesterday. Though i could be wrong.
19-11-2017T14:23:06,Wooffin,Well I guess I will just leave stream on and see if something happens every 30 mins
19-11-2017T14:23:13,Wooffin,Until I faint to pc or crawl to bed
19-11-2017T14:23:17,Wooffin,Or hug my coffee maker
19-11-2017T14:35:44,MidnightBlue78,I've never hugged my coffee maker and i probably should. My coffee makes me happy :ctwokinds-rainehappy:
19-11-2017T14:37:18,Wooffin,Same
19-11-2017T14:37:26,Wooffin,Though we may never match landen
19-11-2017T14:44:58,MidnightBlue78,:ctwokinds-clovischuckle:
19-11-2017T14:45:24,Wooffin,Wonder if he shares coffee or not
19-11-2017T14:47:10,Wooffin,Like if there would be pot of coffee that he has made
19-11-2017T14:47:20,Wooffin,And you'd walk to him and ask if you could have a cup
19-11-2017T14:47:29,Wooffin,"Then would he let you take some, or would he punch your face in"
19-11-2017T14:57:03,Twokinds,AAAAAAAAAAAA

19-11-2017T14:58:38,Wooffin,Normal when you try to do your first pullup
19-11-2017T14:58:53,NeonMitsumi,"But in all seriousness, I assume your arm is feeling better today?"
19-11-2017T14:59:04,NeonMitsumi,Hopefully?

19-11-2017T15:02:15,Wooffin,But no beer as it is monday :/
19-11-2017T15:02:51,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I don't drink anything alcoholic anyway so
19-11-2017T15:03:03,Wooffin,Well that's good
19-11-2017T15:03:27,Wooffin,As alcohol costs and is not nice to drink alone. Plus if you go overboard you will find yourself on next morning with a toilet
19-11-2017T15:04:37,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:ctwokinds-MikeLewd:
19-11-2017T15:04:49,Wooffin,That is not lewd if you just merely kiss the toilet
19-11-2017T15:04:54,NeonMitsumi,lol
19-11-2017T15:04:56,Wooffin,(And maybe throw up)
19-11-2017T15:05:13,Wooffin,How are you doing Neon?

19-11-2017T15:05:40,NeonMitsumi,Busy. As usual. But other than that alright.

19-11-2017T15:06:48,NeonMitsumi,"These two, haha"
19-11-2017T15:06:49,Wooffin,While I eat my cereal
19-11-2017T15:07:23,MidnightBlue78,Tom are you doing better?
19-11-2017T15:07:31,MidnightBlue78,Sorry I just got here
19-11-2017T15:08:37,Wooffin,I think he is preparing his things or getting coffee
19-11-2017T15:08:39,Wooffin,Or both
19-11-2017T15:09:17,MidnightBlue78,Oh cool thank you
19-11-2017T15:09:43,Twokinds,My hand is still stiff and uncooperative
19-11-2017T15:09:56,Wooffin,Can it hold coffee mug properly?
19-11-2017T15:10:05,Twokinds,I got one of those hand-squeezy things and I'm trying to making it art better.
19-11-2017T15:10:15,MidnightBlue78,awww that sucks
19-11-2017T15:10:31,NeonMitsumi,"If needed, you can always skip this week completely."
19-11-2017T15:10:49,Twokinds,"I think it's a little better than yesterday, but it's hard to tell."
19-11-2017T15:11:09,MidnightBlue78,Totally :)
19-11-2017T15:11:12,Wooffin,Well maybe you should give it some type of little test to see how it is
19-11-2017T15:11:19,Wooffin,And then decide whenever you'll stream or not
19-11-2017T15:11:35,MidnightBlue78,Just don't overdo it
19-11-2017T15:11:46,MidnightBlue78,:ctwokinds-maevecute:
19-11-2017T15:11:55,Twokinds,I might try some sketching off camera and see how it goes

19-11-2017T16:59:43,Wooffin,Or at least not focus on chat

19-11-2017T17:39:50,BluePhantom90,Anyone can hack them.
19-11-2017T17:39:53,Bgrmystr2,Something tells me the network wasn't secure at all.

19-11-2017T18:00:17,FenceEqualizer,Boss made Christmas rice krispies treat. I said cool thanks. But isn't it still November? Now he's making me wait to eat one.
19-11-2017T18:00:42,Combak,Niiiice. XD
19-11-2017T18:00:59,unsteddyphoenix,That read like a joke

19-11-2017T18:02:39,Wooffin,&lt;3
19-11-2017T18:04:03,Combak,"BTW, did we get any sort of confirmed plan for today? I thought Tom was going to start at 4, but I don't recall a yes or no on delay or cancellation."
19-11-2017T18:04:25,ChromeDragon24,hes still trying his hand at the art seeing if he can do it
19-11-2017T18:04:33,BadFoMo,I don't think Tom said.
19-11-2017T18:04:44,unsteddyphoenix,Eh nothin' really. At this point I hope it's tomorrow.
19-11-2017T18:04:46,NeonMitsumi,I am fine with skipping.
19-11-2017T18:04:59,BadFoMo,@NeonMitsumi Same.
19-11-2017T18:05:00,NeonMitsumi,Might as well let arm heal properly.
19-11-2017T18:05:46,FenceEqualizer,"Yeah, no problem with waiting. Though I think Tom hates built up work."
19-11-2017T18:05:53,unsteddyphoenix,My guess is he would do the sketch stream and skip the wednesday stream
19-11-2017T18:06:06,unsteddyphoenix,Or perhaps do the sketches on wednesday
19-11-2017T18:06:22,BadFoMo,Or save it for Friday.
19-11-2017T18:06:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I think sketches on wednesday might be the best plan
19-11-2017T18:06:31,MarvTheHugPharaoh,if his hand heals
19-11-2017T18:07:07,NeonMitsumi,"Oh, well. @Twokinds take care! Hopefully the arm heals quickly! Night everyone! Have a nice rest of the day"

19-11-2017T19:15:33,BadFoMo,Nice.
19-11-2017T19:15:44,unsteddyphoenix,I see the windows now match the throne room.
19-11-2017T19:16:01,Twokinds,They also match what they look like later in the comic
19-11-2017T19:16:02,unsteddyphoenix,Consistent architecture :ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
19-11-2017T19:16:50,unsteddyphoenix,Even better!
19-11-2017T19:17:19,unsteddyphoenix,Is that the only change? Besides the quality of course.
19-11-2017T19:18:30,Twokinds,"Yeah, just expanding the background."
19-11-2017T19:18:59,Twokinds,"I didn't used full-bleeds very often in the old days, but whereever I did, I have to extend it so it goes to the edge of the paper."
19-11-2017T19:19:21,Twokinds,"Though it's a lot of work, most people probably wont even notice."
19-11-2017T19:19:50,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah I didnt notice until you pointed it out
19-11-2017T19:20:04,unsteddyphoenix,But I can imagine people noticing on a physical book though
19-11-2017T19:20:35,unsteddyphoenix,"Oh there's a whole keith behind the panels now, that's pretty cool."
19-11-2017T19:20:59,Twokinds,Yeah that too
19-11-2017T19:21:05,Twokinds,https://i.imgur.com/TRcwUfw.jpg
19-11-2017T19:21:48,Twokinds,"Here's an example. Almost unnoticable, but all the edges are expanded, which means they're drawing in from scratch."
19-11-2017T19:22:36,unsteddyphoenix,"Oh, from scratch? You cant just...extend the prexisting one a bit?"
19-11-2017T19:22:54,unsteddyphoenix,Or is that what you meant
19-11-2017T19:23:04,unsteddyphoenix,This looks MUCH better though.
19-11-2017T19:23:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,agreed
19-11-2017T19:23:13,unsteddyphoenix,Sythe isnt cut off for one
19-11-2017T19:23:24,Twokinds,"I could just expand, but it would both decrease the quality, and people would end up cut off."
19-11-2017T19:23:35,Twokinds,because the edges get chopped off. It's called the bleed area.
19-11-2017T19:23:48,Twokinds,It's a buffer zone. So blowing up artwork means the edges get cut.
19-11-2017T19:23:58,Twokinds,"But if you don't, you might end up with white edges."
19-11-2017T19:24:05,Twokinds,Which looks bad.
19-11-2017T19:24:33,unsteddyphoenix,I see. You have to redraw it 'cause you cant risk anything important on the edges getting cut off
19-11-2017T19:25:24,unsteddyphoenix,Its the type of thing that people only notice when done badly
19-11-2017T19:27:50,unsteddyphoenix,"You just have to do chapter 13 and you're done, right?"
19-11-2017T19:29:44,Wooffin,Huh
19-11-2017T19:29:57,Wooffin,When I dissapear for half hour or hour people chat ^^;
19-11-2017T19:30:15,Twokinds,Still a lot of work to do
19-11-2017T19:30:36,Twokinds,"I have to proofread everything, and some of the pages are getting rearranged so it reads better"
19-11-2017T19:31:05,unsteddyphoenix,"Good point, you STILL have chapter 13 to do~"
19-11-2017T19:31:14,Wooffin,How is your hand Tom tom?
19-11-2017T19:31:16,unsteddyphoenix,"You can outsource the proofreading, surely."
19-11-2017T19:31:56,unsteddyphoenix,An hour ago I would've offered
19-11-2017T19:31:59,Twokinds,Sure if I can rangle people to help
19-11-2017T19:32:07,Twokinds,https://i.imgur.com/GzHVxTf.jpg
19-11-2017T19:32:24,Twokinds,Here's a more major example of art expansion.
19-11-2017T19:32:28,Twokinds,From Book 3
19-11-2017T19:33:04,FenceEqualizer,"Oh dear, that looks awesome. This crappy phone can spot the changes on that last pic."
19-11-2017T19:33:32,BluePhantom90,yeah the quality looks so much better
19-11-2017T19:33:40,unsteddyphoenix,"Ahh, nostalgia~"
19-11-2017T19:33:40,MarvTheHugPharaoh,shadows on the mountains look better too
19-11-2017T19:33:40,BluePhantom90,Btw Tom hows your hand doing?
19-11-2017T19:33:48,unsteddyphoenix,My reaction was the same as Kats when I first saw that vista
19-11-2017T19:34:20,unsteddyphoenix,"""chapter 10 title page panel redraw"" request~ :ctwokinds-NoraEyebrows:"
19-11-2017T19:34:29,Bgrmystr2,Next level quality right there
19-11-2017T19:34:30,Twokinds,lol
19-11-2017T19:34:39,Bgrmystr2,definitely improved
19-11-2017T19:35:00,Twokinds,"If I were to redraw it, I'd probably try to have it from the perspective of the ship instead of a bird's eye."
19-11-2017T19:35:27,BluePhantom90,Yeah Birds eye was way better.
19-11-2017T19:35:33,unsteddyphoenix,"You talk as if you'd consider it, this interests me."
19-11-2017T19:36:23,Twokinds,Eh maybe
19-11-2017T19:37:24,BluePhantom90,What you wouldn't get the same awesome view.
19-11-2017T19:37:33,unsteddyphoenix,Noted. Perhaps after I get/give up on my current dumb one.
19-11-2017T19:37:51,MarvTheHugPharaoh,never give up
19-11-2017T19:38:00,Wooffin,Never give in

19-11-2017T19:40:17,unsteddyphoenix,"""Tomtom"""
19-11-2017T19:40:18,BluePhantom90,lol Don't call Tom a TomTom thats a GPS.
19-11-2017T19:40:33,Wooffin,But tom tom sounds funny
19-11-2017T19:41:02,unsteddyphoenix,"Sure, if he was 3 and a half."
19-11-2017T19:41:12,Wooffin,Or maybe that sounds funny just because I am childish weirdo
19-11-2017T19:42:21,Wooffin,But it seems my question got ignored =/
19-11-2017T19:46:12,unsteddyphoenix,A FAQ would be better
19-11-2017T19:46:24,unsteddyphoenix,The same few questions get repeated a lot
