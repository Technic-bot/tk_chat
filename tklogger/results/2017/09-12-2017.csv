09-12-2017T03:04:35,iZute,wellthat not your fault XD

09-12-2017T03:06:26,DontuDare,i was walking and turned but my leg didnt go with the body
09-12-2017T03:06:39,DontuDare,it was just random

09-12-2017T16:03:31,Kamaro12,and?
09-12-2017T16:03:50,FoxxTrotter,A little bit more than that.
09-12-2017T16:03:57,Kamaro12,you donate 100 dollars and that's going to be 3.25 extra
09-12-2017T16:04:11,Kamaro12,"if you don't like that, lower your pledge until it matches that"
09-12-2017T16:04:17,Kamaro12,all you have to do
09-12-2017T16:04:31,unsteddyphoenix,But what if you have 100 $1 donations :thinking:
09-12-2017T16:04:32,Kamaro12,"er, matches 100 again, is what I meant to say"
09-12-2017T16:04:34,TheGamakazi,@Kamaro12 if you only want to donate $1 you will have to pay nearly 50% just to donate that
09-12-2017T16:04:44,NeonMitsumi,"Then your fukd, Phoenix"
09-12-2017T16:04:50,Kamaro12,unsteddy: then you're very noncommittal :U

09-12-2017T16:05:16,Foxpie,the problem is for people who donate to multiplu people  you pay it for each of them and that can add up

09-12-2017T16:07:36,CrimsonHelsing,Eh sixty cents on the ten dollar pledge is no biggie for me. Though I am not okay with the extra anyway

09-12-2017T16:39:08,Bgrmystr2,Traitor tail absolutely requires that the user NOT want the tail to be doing what it's doing.

09-12-2017T16:44:42,Bgrmystr2,"it needs a taller room, stat."
09-12-2017T16:44:54,Combak,Hi Abist.
09-12-2017T16:45:10,MetalAppleSauce,1 Maeve = 1.5 m or about 4.9 ft
09-12-2017T16:45:20,SushiWolf0123,"oh, now it's larger"
09-12-2017T16:45:23,ValSalianResident,She's that tall?
09-12-2017T16:45:27,CrRAR,I wonder if some poor town is now missing the christmas tree they just painstakingly decorated.
09-12-2017T16:45:27,unsteddyphoenix,"Should be measuring in Keiths, really."
09-12-2017T16:45:33,SushiWolf0123,nvm 2.3 maeves is probably right

09-12-2017T16:46:23,MetalAppleSauce,it's barely past 1.5 Maeves
09-12-2017T16:46:23,SushiWolf0123,"well, now the perspective has changed"
09-12-2017T16:46:24,Sarandiel,"The tree is from Clovis's house, it's ok"

09-12-2017T17:50:02,Kamaro12,bgr: both his parents died. you really think those qualities are because he's feminine and not from the trauma of that event?

09-12-2017T17:50:39,Bgrmystr2,That's just the tip of the iceberg Kam. Plenty of times Natani has taken a more lead role during the comic rather than keith
09-12-2017T17:50:46,CrimsonHelsing,Yea I'd be pretty defensive too if I were orphaned firsthand and labeled a criminal

09-12-2017T17:51:08,ValSalianResident,Needs either a wagging tail or katanatail
09-12-2017T17:51:18,ProsePro7,I think Keith is pretty manly I mean he got Madie  all flustered and I have yet to see him lose a fight

09-12-2017T17:52:12,BluePhantom90,well we are seeing Keith lose a fight to himself. But he would have lost to his General Friend if divine luck had not helped him.
09-12-2017T17:52:13,unsteddyphoenix,A lot of the irony in his relationship with natani is that she often takes the traditionally male role.
09-12-2017T17:52:15,Kamaro12,bgr: the comic and basitin culture are reflections of real life
09-12-2017T17:52:33,Bgrmystr2,Literally what phoenix says.

09-12-2017T18:03:54,Dadrobit,Only minor magics.
09-12-2017T18:03:55,BadFoMo,A minute?! Where did you see it?
09-12-2017T18:03:58,unsteddyphoenix,Also this is sidecomic majicks
09-12-2017T18:04:00,MetalAppleSauce,They're immune to poisons
09-12-2017T18:04:00,NeonMitsumi,What a waste of magic bracelet.
09-12-2017T18:04:04,unsteddyphoenix,Which is different from comic magic
09-12-2017T18:04:11,ProsePro7,Pixie magic didn't affect them so the necklace shouldn't either
09-12-2017T18:04:11,Bgrmystr2,"they can't USE magic naturally, no, but large magics tend to hurt them in general."
09-12-2017T18:04:13,BluePhantom90,you know didn't anyone do a Keith and Nat swap Races. Nat becomes a Basitin and Keith becomes Full wolf?
09-12-2017T18:04:14,Bgrmystr2,Like the tower
09-12-2017T18:04:18,Dadrobit,Magic is what stopped their invasion in years past.
09-12-2017T18:04:45,unsteddyphoenix,That and overwhelming force from two united races
09-12-2017T18:04:47,Bgrmystr2,"You have to think what level of magic the necklace is though, Prose"
09-12-2017T18:04:49,Dadrobit,And it totally wiped the King's guard in comic canon.
09-12-2017T18:04:50,NeonMitsumi,"Swaps are overused, but so is ""Keith and Nat do a thing #84"""
09-12-2017T18:04:58,Bgrmystr2,Pixie magic is probably very light
09-12-2017T18:05:03,Serpentfrog,Magic makes them go mad hence they become feral keidran.
09-12-2017T18:05:03,BaronVonDrachen,Superior Basitin Militarism always wins
09-12-2017T18:05:28,ProsePro7,Don't care if it's over used I love it
09-12-2017T18:05:52,ValSalianResident,"How about ""Keith and Natani swap genders/race/whatever"""
09-12-2017T18:06:02,Serpentfrog,"That's how you get fat, Prose."
09-12-2017T18:06:06,ValSalianResident,Now THERE'S an original idea!
09-12-2017T18:06:13,BadFoMo,"@NeonMitsumi //Troll? Yse, lets do things like Naga TFs!"
09-12-2017T18:06:15,Serpentfrog,Mhmmm.
09-12-2017T18:06:15,MetalAppleSauce,"I think we're forgetting which race is immune to what, serp"
09-12-2017T18:06:17,KuroganeWatanoshi,hey
09-12-2017T18:06:20,BadFoMo,*Yes
09-12-2017T18:06:24,NeonMitsumi,@BadMoFo ban
09-12-2017T18:06:31,Dadrobit,"Years ago Tom posted in the forums about their magic resists. 50% resist, but whatever makes it over the threshold is devastating to them."
09-12-2017T18:06:40,Serpentfrog,"Not really, Metal."
09-12-2017T18:06:52,Kamaro12,sounds like a shitty racial trait :U
09-12-2017T18:07:05,unsteddyphoenix,I mean...
09-12-2017T18:07:06,ValSalianResident,"Wait, that's not how percentage-based damage resistance works..."
09-12-2017T18:07:10,Bgrmystr2,it makes them balanced otherwise.
09-12-2017T18:07:16,Bgrmystr2,:u
09-12-2017T18:07:39,BadFoMo,@NeonMitsumi Keidran Red getting bellyrubs from Human Raine?
09-12-2017T18:07:39,KuroganeWatanoshi,I wonder if Keidrans are a spieces people make fursonas of
09-12-2017T18:07:43,unsteddyphoenix,"In any case, the collar's made up and the rules dont matter."
09-12-2017T18:07:46,MarvTheHugPharaoh,No Fofmo
09-12-2017T18:07:57,ValSalianResident,"They're kinda generic furry species, kuro"
09-12-2017T18:08:00,unsteddyphoenix,Nope noone does that.
09-12-2017T18:08:00,Bgrmystr2,"If basitins weren't weak to strong magic, they'd be the strongest race of the three."
09-12-2017T18:08:02,Dadrobit,"Yes Kuro, it's happened."
09-12-2017T18:08:10,NeonMitsumi,@BadFoMo Better.
09-12-2017T18:08:16,unsteddyphoenix,Nah disagree bgr
09-12-2017T18:08:20,Dadrobit,There are even cosplays out there.
09-12-2017T18:08:28,Bgrmystr2,"How so, Phoenix?"
09-12-2017T18:08:35,unsteddyphoenix,"The utility of magic is way too useful, humans would still be the strongest."
09-12-2017T18:08:45,MetalAppleSauce,"Twokinds is 14 years old, if there isn't cosplays there's something wrong"
09-12-2017T18:08:53,Bgrmystr2,That's really the only thing the humans have against the basitin though
09-12-2017T18:08:58,Bgrmystr2,is magic
09-12-2017T18:08:58,KuroganeWatanoshi,I'd like to make a basitin OC XD
09-12-2017T18:09:10,Serpentfrog,"If there are cosplays, something else is wrong."
09-12-2017T18:09:14,BadFoMo,@MarvTheHugPharaoh ...As a mild form of abuse?
09-12-2017T18:09:15,unsteddyphoenix,That and superior numbers and resources
09-12-2017T18:09:21,Dadrobit,"Yeah, but magic really has no hard limits on its powers."
09-12-2017T18:09:24,unsteddyphoenix,And dragons
09-12-2017T18:09:37,MarvTheHugPharaoh,@BadFoMo Red getting belly rubs from sythe
09-12-2017T18:09:41,ValSalianResident,So how does the Twokinds powerlevel chart look?
09-12-2017T18:09:52,ChromeDragon24,over 9000
09-12-2017T18:09:53,Serpentfrog,It's over 9000!
09-12-2017T18:10:02,Serpentfrog,"Damn it, Chrome."
09-12-2017T18:10:03,Twokinds,Done
09-12-2017T18:10:05,ValSalianResident,Oh wow it's like I'm back in 2005
09-12-2017T18:10:07,Dadrobit,Adelaide&gt;Nora&gt;Reni&gt;Trace&gt;Keith
09-12-2017T18:10:08,TraceLegacy,Wonder whats next?
09-12-2017T18:10:12,Kamaro12,so who wins
09-12-2017T18:10:12,CrRAR,good one!
09-12-2017T18:10:12,unsteddyphoenix,Nice job~
09-12-2017T18:10:13,Bgrmystr2,"Basitin are already physically the strongest. Tom has already said if Basitins could use magic, they'd be OP :P"
09-12-2017T18:10:17,BluePhantom90,nice Tom
09-12-2017T18:10:17,ChromeDragon24,lovely

09-12-2017T18:10:27,CrimsonHelsing,x3
09-12-2017T18:10:28,Kamaro12,seems like Keith's got the advantage here. Keith could make a comeback though
09-12-2017T18:10:30,MarvTheHugPharaoh,L:ove it Tom
09-12-2017T18:10:30,ValSalianResident,Masks&gt;Dragons&gt;Adelaide&gt;Everyone else

09-12-2017T18:10:37,KuroganeWatanoshi,nice
09-12-2017T18:10:38,unsteddyphoenix,Always bet on Keith
09-12-2017T18:10:46,Ordithus,Noice!
09-12-2017T18:10:48,unsteddyphoenix,You literally dispelled your own point my dude.
09-12-2017T18:10:53,Kamaro12,spoiler alert: keith wins
09-12-2017T18:10:55,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I bet on boob keith
09-12-2017T18:10:57,Devlfry,N.o.i.c.e
09-12-2017T18:10:57,Dadrobit,I'm betting on the spectators being the winners.
09-12-2017T18:10:57,unsteddyphoenix,(Get it? Dispelled?)
09-12-2017T18:10:59,NeonMitsumi,Fucking Moppy
09-12-2017T18:11:05,CrRAR,indeed robit

09-12-2017T18:11:25,Serpentfrog,"Unboob me, Marv."
09-12-2017T18:11:31,ProsePro7,Watch your fricking language!
09-12-2017T18:11:34,unsteddyphoenix,I bet on the effeminate keith.
09-12-2017T18:11:34,Bgrmystr2,"xD I haven't changed anything. You're just agreeing to the same point you disagreed to, so I mean.. :thinking: okay."
09-12-2017T18:11:34,BoxStealthFox,lol
09-12-2017T18:11:36,MarvTheHugPharaoh,UNBOOB ME HUMANS
09-12-2017T18:11:49,TheBeckoner,I do like this very much
09-12-2017T18:11:59,ProsePro7,Which effeminate Keith?
09-12-2017T18:12:02,unsteddyphoenix,How do you get lost EVERY time.
09-12-2017T18:12:04,TraceLegacy,THIS IS A CHRISTIAN MINECRAFT SERVER
09-12-2017T18:12:06,Serpentfrog,And now I get massive lag. It's a Christmas miracle.
09-12-2017T18:12:09,unsteddyphoenix,You have to be doing this on purpose
09-12-2017T18:12:15,CrRAR,yaaay
09-12-2017T18:12:16,NeonMitsumi,Stop spamming Trace
09-12-2017T18:12:18,BluePhantom90,well let see what Tom will Draw next
09-12-2017T18:12:28,Bgrmystr2,I haven't gone anywhere. Still here. Same spot.
09-12-2017T18:12:41,BaronVonDrachen,This is a Hindu server thank you very hecking much
09-12-2017T18:12:41,ValSalianResident,I'm hoping he will draw the one he skipped last time
09-12-2017T18:12:43,unsteddyphoenix,That's why im baffled that you've somehow gotten lost.
09-12-2017T18:12:58,Serpentfrog,"As a Buddhist, this offends me."
09-12-2017T18:13:02,Bgrmystr2,More baffling to me where you ran off to. xD
09-12-2017T18:13:04,NeonMitsumi,Same Serp
09-12-2017T18:13:14,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I'm just here for the food
09-12-2017T18:13:16,katadom,@Bgrmystr2 What strengths do Keidran have over the other races?
09-12-2017T18:13:20,NeonMitsumi,Food sounds good
09-12-2017T18:13:22,Dadrobit,Libido
09-12-2017T18:13:23,KuroganeWatanoshi,How does one use OBS without the lag.
09-12-2017T18:13:26,unsteddyphoenix,"Lol. Alright man, enjoy that place youre livin' in"

09-12-2017T18:13:29,Ordithus,"lol, robit"
09-12-2017T18:13:32,BaronVonDrachen,Dad has ir right
09-12-2017T18:13:36,ValSalianResident,...Superior strength?
09-12-2017T18:13:37,MetalAppleSauce,@katadom the excuse to walk around naked
09-12-2017T18:13:51,ChromeDragon24,heh
09-12-2017T18:13:51,unsteddyphoenix,Keidran have...
09-12-2017T18:13:58,unsteddyphoenix,...
09-12-2017T18:13:58,Bgrmystr2,"lol Kata I don't actually recall. I mean, they can use magic via crystals"
09-12-2017T18:14:02,ChromeDragon24,"they have, charisma"
09-12-2017T18:14:07,Dadrobit,"Literally nothing, they're a trash race"
09-12-2017T18:14:14,TheBeckoner,I believe basitins are strongest?
09-12-2017T18:14:18,Ordithus,"Wow, rude."
09-12-2017T18:14:26,TheBeckoner,Humans are most intellegent
09-12-2017T18:14:29,unsteddyphoenix,I mean...yeah...they kinda suck lol
09-12-2017T18:14:35,TheBeckoner,except I spelled that wrong
09-12-2017T18:14:39,Dadrobit,It's like playing an Argonian.
09-12-2017T18:14:40,ValSalianResident,...Fast breeding cycles?
09-12-2017T18:14:45,TheBeckoner,Intelligent* lol
09-12-2017T18:15:05,unsteddyphoenix,"If they all banded together, then theyd be the horde race"
09-12-2017T18:15:07,Erroneous,"its true though, no magic without crystals, life expectancy of like 24 to 28, prone to losing themselves to their primal instincts"
09-12-2017T18:15:10,unsteddyphoenix,But they're all divided so~
09-12-2017T18:15:12,BaronVonDrachen,They breed quick but die faster.
09-12-2017T18:15:13,Serpentfrog,Argonians? Bring on thescalies!
09-12-2017T18:15:16,Erroneous,being a keidran is suffering
09-12-2017T18:15:27,Bgrmystr2,"Keidran are fast and agile, just simply because of their form. But yeah I think phoenix is right. They're mostly a horde race."
09-12-2017T18:15:27,Tytytyty1410,Animal senses
09-12-2017T18:15:35,Serpentfrog,"Only because of the whole enslavement thing, Err."
09-12-2017T18:15:42,Ordithus,"They are stronger than humans, and can do magic unlike the Basitins."
09-12-2017T18:15:56,Dadrobit,"There's been speculation that they're all actually potentially intellectual savants, but the culture of Mekkan keeps them down."
09-12-2017T18:15:57,katadom,I guess that they are the balance race between physical and Magic power.
09-12-2017T18:15:57,ValSalianResident,So a jack-of-all-trades race?
09-12-2017T18:16:04,unsteddyphoenix,"Well considering they enslave each other all the time, thats not much of an excuse"
09-12-2017T18:16:06,Lumberin,hello
09-12-2017T18:16:18,Ordithus,Looks like Adelaide.
09-12-2017T18:16:25,BaronVonDrachen,wilkommen
09-12-2017T18:16:29,Bgrmystr2,"They're definitely stronger than humans physically, but can't do as much magic.. but not as strong as basitins"
09-12-2017T18:16:29,TheBeckoner,Human supreme they all suck eggs
09-12-2017T18:16:35,Ordithus,Basitins are the theme today.
09-12-2017T18:16:42,Serpentfrog,Nicht willkommen. geh weg.
09-12-2017T18:16:47,CrimsonHelsing,"Whoa, wuzzis? o3o"
09-12-2017T18:16:55,ValSalianResident,"Doesn't Keith complain about Nat's ""freakish wolf strength"" all the time though?"
09-12-2017T18:17:13,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: I don't.. recall that Val
09-12-2017T18:17:24,Serpentfrog,He knows he likes it. ;)
09-12-2017T18:17:29,MarvTheHugPharaoh,lol
09-12-2017T18:17:30,Dadrobit,"He's just surprised by it is all, doesn't mean he's not stronger."
09-12-2017T18:17:42,unsteddyphoenix,"When she breaks a stone bridge with a sword, we'll reevaluate"
09-12-2017T18:17:50,TheBeckoner,^
09-12-2017T18:17:51,WereKeidran,"he made one comment when she was sleep grabbing him,not something that happens all the time though"

09-12-2017T18:18:02,unsteddyphoenix,lmao

09-12-2017T18:18:51,Dadrobit,"But he did, and it was when he was eakened."
09-12-2017T18:18:53,unsteddyphoenix,basitins have anime powers
09-12-2017T18:18:54,Dadrobit,weakened

09-12-2017T20:31:25,MetalAppleSauce,the true link to it
09-12-2017T20:31:31,MarshallMelon,To be fair that's just how 4chan works. Anything not related to B or POL gets sent there

09-12-2017T20:31:40,Dimensional,Not a belly rub?

09-12-2017T20:32:22,Tempystral,It's just shittier versions of 4chan memes and a constant sense that if you're not a failure you'll be rejected
09-12-2017T20:32:30,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:ctwokinds-KatDance:
09-12-2017T20:32:30,BadFoMo,@Tempystral ...What's on it?
09-12-2017T20:32:34,PalmettoPathfinder1,"@Bgrmystr2 well, I think you would enjoy reading it.  Since you enjoy reading TwoKinds as well.  It's similar to that as well (some key differences but I'm not going to spoil everything for you though)."
09-12-2017T20:32:46,BadFoMo,Never mind.
09-12-2017T20:32:56,swedishkitsune,what sketch is this?
09-12-2017T20:32:57,Tempystral,Not the funnest place

09-12-2017T20:33:31,MetalAppleSauce,"for some reason i had it in my head that it was sythe there, not zen"
09-12-2017T20:33:35,MarshallMelon,"Anyways, apologies for that link. It was the closest I had on hand"
09-12-2017T20:33:40,swedishkitsune,"ah, thanks for the answer :)"
09-12-2017T20:33:54,Bgrmystr2,So you can stop being a telemarketer.
09-12-2017T20:34:14,BadFoMo,He's helping her back up?
09-12-2017T20:34:16,Sarandiel,lol telemarketer
09-12-2017T20:34:18,CrRAR,yerp
09-12-2017T20:34:31,MarshallMelon,Wouldn't it be an intramarketer here?
09-12-2017T20:34:43,ZizzoGaming,^
09-12-2017T20:34:53,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Hey hey, no need to be mean.  I was just suggesting something I think you might like that's all.  I'm sorry okay."
09-12-2017T20:35:00,Tempystral,"If tele- is meant to be read as ""distantly"", yes"
09-12-2017T20:35:08,MarshallMelon,It's just that you took it too far Palm
09-12-2017T20:35:16,MarshallMelon,"When someone says no, that's when you stop"
09-12-2017T20:35:20,Tempystral,"If tele- is instead an abbreviation of telephone, it would be... chatamarketer???"
09-12-2017T20:35:21,Nekonny,Just dial it back a bit ^^
09-12-2017T20:35:29,unsteddyphoenix,no means no

09-12-2017T20:36:39,Tempystral,"That's actually neat, cause the tele- prefix in ""telemarketer"" comes from ""telephone"", not the original greek teleo"
09-12-2017T20:36:42,unsteddyphoenix,./s
09-12-2017T20:36:42,Combak,"So, this is sketch 6 right?"

09-12-2017T20:36:48,unsteddyphoenix,Think so
09-12-2017T20:36:55,Tempystral,"But tele- in telephone does come from greek, neato"

09-12-2017T20:44:33,CrRAR,haha Metal
09-12-2017T20:44:34,DarthKeidran,So what sketches did I miss?
09-12-2017T20:44:44,CrRAR,I'm having MIB flashbacks.
09-12-2017T20:45:06,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"@ikearat I tried the link out on my end, did it have red text on the bottom?"
09-12-2017T20:45:09,Vexd,"I disagree, look at the way it's worded"
09-12-2017T20:45:11,ZizzoGaming,MIB? As in Men in Black?
09-12-2017T20:45:16,CrRAR,yeah
09-12-2017T20:45:23,Vexd,Doesn't it seem a little off?
09-12-2017T20:45:26,Twokinds,Basitins do not get winter coats
09-12-2017T20:45:27,Tempystral,Aaaaand the expected one won
09-12-2017T20:45:35,Combak,Does anyone know what the suggestion for the current sketch was?
09-12-2017T20:45:38,Sarandiel,Can basitins have long fur at all?
09-12-2017T20:45:43,WereKeidran,there was a sketch with Zen and Natani as MIB operatives
09-12-2017T20:45:46,Twokinds,no
09-12-2017T20:45:47,unsteddyphoenix,Neither does Kats~
09-12-2017T20:45:50,Starflight,Well there we go.
09-12-2017T20:45:50,thestooge,"Missed the poll, but was pleased with the results! :)"
09-12-2017T20:45:52,MarvTheHugPharaoh,here come the MIB
09-12-2017T20:45:53,Sarandiel,D:
09-12-2017T20:46:05,Tempystral,They do live on what looks like a temperate island
09-12-2017T20:46:07,DarthKeidran,I got sidetracked by working on the poster so I missed the stream until now. What has been sketched?
09-12-2017T20:46:10,Starflight,So we won't be getting floofy keith.
09-12-2017T20:46:13,Starflight,Damn
09-12-2017T20:46:16,DJSylveon,When you forget theres an app for picarto
09-12-2017T20:46:19,BadFoMo,Back. Who's being drawn half octopus?
09-12-2017T20:46:25,ikearat,"No. All black and white with an option to clear local storage. No other ""buttons"" and only the link for additional info."
09-12-2017T20:46:26,Kryp7ic,"but theres also apparently exiles up north, so...."
09-12-2017T20:46:28,Ordithus,"Basitins, Darth.  You missed Basitins."
09-12-2017T20:46:29,CrRAR,Floofy Keith could be a curse.
09-12-2017T20:46:38,Starflight,How dare you say such
09-12-2017T20:46:45,Starflight,NONSENSE
09-12-2017T20:46:48,Xexanoth,Floofy Keith: Nat pranks Keith by replacing his Shampoo with hair Growth Formula
09-12-2017T20:46:55,CrRAR,lol
09-12-2017T20:47:02,Sarandiel,Yeah Keith explained the short fur thing when they were at the inn on the basitin islands. They would be so cute floofy though....
09-12-2017T20:47:10,Twokinds,no no more floofy aaaah
09-12-2017T20:47:12,MarvTheHugPharaoh,@ikearat Weird
09-12-2017T20:47:14,TheVileOne,or like cousin it
09-12-2017T20:47:20,TheVileOne,:p
09-12-2017T20:47:23,DarthKeidran,What's this sketch? I'm so confused.
09-12-2017T20:47:23,unsteddyphoenix,All the flooffy sketches are the same anyway
09-12-2017T20:47:26,unsteddyphoenix,Ah yeah
09-12-2017T20:47:27,Sarandiel,I wonder if with their military culture they'd find long fur inconvenient and/or unhygenic
09-12-2017T20:47:28,CrRAR,The floof stops here
09-12-2017T20:47:39,Kryp7ic,aw man...
09-12-2017T20:47:39,MarvTheHugPharaoh,does happy dance while will smith raps
09-12-2017T20:47:52,unsteddyphoenix,The first sketch was amazing but the rest are just all the same as that one
09-12-2017T20:47:59,BluePhantom90,lol come on tom we want fluff!
09-12-2017T20:48:00,DarthKeidran,Oh wait. That's Raine. Now I'm less confused.
09-12-2017T20:48:10,BadFoMo,"@DarthKeidran Zen and Raine 'Ice Scating""."
09-12-2017T20:48:16,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:D

09-12-2017T20:48:44,Combak,"... Oh, I thought it was Nat too. XD"
09-12-2017T20:48:47,PalmettoPathfinder1,I prefer Sythe and Raine @Tempystral
09-12-2017T20:48:52,MarshallMelon,At first I thought it was Massage 2.0
09-12-2017T20:48:53,ZizzoGaming,Marv ships Zaine
09-12-2017T20:48:54,DarthKeidran,"Zen and Raine are my primary ""Secondary Couple"" Ship."
09-12-2017T20:49:01,Vexd,What counts as an invalid ship?
09-12-2017T20:49:02,MarshallMelon,"Apologies for getting ahead of myself there, Tom"
09-12-2017T20:49:04,CrRAR,Tail is good cushion for fall.

09-12-2017T20:50:41,ZizzoGaming,Don't worry about it
09-12-2017T20:50:42,Combak,No one worth mentioning.
09-12-2017T20:50:43,FenceEqualizer,Some arse.
09-12-2017T20:50:48,Starflight,Fair enough.
09-12-2017T20:50:51,CrRAR,you're finding out marv
09-12-2017T20:50:52,Bgrmystr2,Someone causing trouble
09-12-2017T20:50:54,MidnightBlue78,irrelevant
09-12-2017T20:50:58,ZizzoGaming,"They are gone now, that's all that matters"
09-12-2017T20:51:06,BadFoMo,@Tempystral What Combak said.
09-12-2017T20:51:14,DJSylveon,Whats important is its a present
09-12-2017T20:51:25,unsteddyphoenix,Ok only one person has to answer lol
09-12-2017T20:51:37,Combak,"You know what, now that I think about... Digitigrade ice skates would be really small."
09-12-2017T20:51:42,Sarandiel,Nope the entire chat must answer
09-12-2017T20:51:43,unsteddyphoenix,And super difficult
09-12-2017T20:51:44,FenceEqualizer,We all have to answer. IN unison.
09-12-2017T20:51:47,MarshallMelon,Would they even need them?
09-12-2017T20:51:48,BoxStealthFox,Faded has faded away
09-12-2017T20:51:48,Bgrmystr2,and that's why everyone answers Phoenix
09-12-2017T20:51:49,unsteddyphoenix,No wonder Raine fell over
09-12-2017T20:51:53,Bgrmystr2,cuz everyone must be that one person.
09-12-2017T20:52:04,Sarandiel,Idk I think the ice skates would be long like mini-skis
09-12-2017T20:52:08,unsteddyphoenix,"""No-one important"" -everyone, making them seem important."
09-12-2017T20:52:21,Ordithus,Raine has a hard enough time walking Keidran-style already
09-12-2017T20:52:27,DJSylveon,So if someone were to ask the time we all have to answer according to internet law 23.7c?
09-12-2017T20:52:27,Ordithus,"So skating, yikes."
09-12-2017T20:52:29,qwe304,am i the only one a bit nervous about the look on zen's face?
09-12-2017T20:52:35,Combak,I guess they could have a long arch support thing for extra length.
09-12-2017T20:52:39,MarvTheHugPharaoh,yes qwe
09-12-2017T20:52:41,DarthKeidran,"By the look of things, mine wasn't included in the poll, but I don't blame Tom, it could be a potential spoiler, but most likely, it was just too dang complex."
09-12-2017T20:52:43,Bgrmystr2,Yeah qwe
09-12-2017T20:52:46,MarshallMelon,She's falling down 'cause of the roofies
09-12-2017T20:52:49,MarshallMelon,Not the ice
09-12-2017T20:52:50,Sarandiel,"if they're just paw sized I think it'd be hard to balance. Idk, I only skated once and I spent the whole time on the floor"
09-12-2017T20:52:50,MetalAppleSauce,am i the only one who thinks that looks suspiciously like not zen?
09-12-2017T20:52:50,Combak,"Yeah qwe, it's just a smile."
09-12-2017T20:53:16,Starflight,I think it looks like zen.
09-12-2017T20:53:17,MarshallMelon,"Dunno, looks like him, Metal"
09-12-2017T20:53:19,unsteddyphoenix,Maybe they're like...adjustable.
09-12-2017T20:53:20,BadFoMo,@qwe304 What dose it say to you?
09-12-2017T20:53:21,Starflight,Tom knows how to draw.

09-12-2017T20:55:24,qwe304,@BadFoMo lets hope
09-12-2017T20:55:28,MarshallMelon,"Where do you post this stuff, Darth?"
09-12-2017T20:55:30,Ordithus,Bye Darth
09-12-2017T20:55:36,Sarandiel,I've been thinking about suggesting Zen and Sythe clothes shopping together...since they've travelled almost nude for so long
09-12-2017T20:55:37,DarthKeidran,My DeviantArt
09-12-2017T20:55:56,MarshallMelon,Huh. Interesting. Never seen it come up in searches before.
09-12-2017T20:56:00,DarthKeidran,As well as on the community page on Patreon
09-12-2017T20:56:06,MarvTheHugPharaoh,@Sarandiel Raine and Maren forces Sythe and Zen to go clothe shopping?
09-12-2017T20:56:11,MetalAppleSauce,"bah, the group's joined up. kat's gonna be on it in no time"
09-12-2017T20:56:27,Ordithus,"Hmm... considering her journal entries, I expect if Raine knew she's shipped with Team B, she'd be flattered."
09-12-2017T20:56:36,Starflight,Kat isn't with the Reni squad though?
09-12-2017T20:56:40,MarvTheHugPharaoh,back to happy dance
09-12-2017T20:56:45,TheBeckoner,"I am back, what's this drawing of?"
09-12-2017T20:56:50,ImaShadow,What is he drawing?
09-12-2017T20:56:57,Tempystral,Skating I think
09-12-2017T20:56:58,WereKeidran,Zen adn Raine ice skating
09-12-2017T20:57:01,Sarandiel,Marv not a bad addition
09-12-2017T20:57:01,ZizzoGaming,Ice Skating
09-12-2017T20:57:03,qwe304,@Starflight no
09-12-2017T20:57:03,MarshallMelon,Zen's drugged Raine and is taking her back to his lair
09-12-2017T20:57:04,WereKeidran,*and
09-12-2017T20:57:13,BadFoMo,@Starflight I don't think so.

09-12-2017T20:58:07,Combak,You got summer up there Tempy.
09-12-2017T20:58:08,MetalAppleSauce,I think the plan is reni squad was gonna save group B and return to the estate
09-12-2017T20:58:10,BadFoMo,@Starflight Unless she stowed away somehow.
09-12-2017T20:58:14,Tempystral,Yep
09-12-2017T20:58:46,Combak,"Reni was overloaded the way there, I doubt Kat could've come along."
09-12-2017T20:58:54,Starflight,She would've fallen out of the bags when Reni crashed too.
09-12-2017T20:58:59,Starflight,So no Seamstress Kat.
09-12-2017T20:59:09,Sarandiel,"No Reni can't carry that much weigh, she's gonna make an ice path all the way to the estate and make them all skate back"
09-12-2017T20:59:12,Zakuru,im done drawing for today
09-12-2017T20:59:14,MetalAppleSauce,Reni squad is just the main four as far as we've seen
09-12-2017T20:59:17,Combak,... That actually raises a decent question. I guess they'll be walking back?
09-12-2017T20:59:20,Zakuru,time to nibble on some cheez-its
09-12-2017T20:59:21,DarthKeidran,"Well, good to see yall, hopefully I get back soon."
09-12-2017T20:59:27,Combak,Bye Zak!

09-12-2017T20:59:37,MarvTheHugPharaoh,see ya Darth
09-12-2017T20:59:39,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah my guess is Zen + Nat goes back on Reni and the rest walk?
09-12-2017T20:59:41,Zakuru,pounces in combak's lap
09-12-2017T20:59:43,Combak,"Yeah, just processed that. XD"
09-12-2017T20:59:44,Sammit,Bye Darth
09-12-2017T20:59:46,Ordithus,They're probably only a day's walk away.
09-12-2017T20:59:56,Combak,Maybe two.
09-12-2017T21:00:02,Zakuru,now you'll have crumbs in your lap
09-12-2017T21:00:06,Zakuru,*om nom nom nom*
09-12-2017T21:00:09,MetalAppleSauce,i think the entirety of the joined group's gonna go back in the bag
09-12-2017T21:00:11,Sarandiel,"Yeah the wolves need to go back on Reni, but Trace might have an issue with Flora walking that far"
09-12-2017T21:00:21,Combak,"Either way, Reni could probably ferry them back in smaller groups once she recovers."
09-12-2017T21:00:24,PalmettoPathfinder1,Loving this pic.
09-12-2017T21:00:27,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"@unsteddyphoenix Nah man, Reni goes ""Fuck y'all, I'm leaving!"""
09-12-2017T21:00:42,qwe304,trace could teleport...
09-12-2017T21:00:43,Sarandiel,OR Reni transforms into a truck/train
09-12-2017T21:00:55,Ordithus,She did land on her face guys...
09-12-2017T21:00:59,Combak,"No he can't, he can't really use magic ATM."
09-12-2017T21:01:09,unsteddyphoenix,"Puts on shades, flips them off, flies away"
09-12-2017T21:01:18,FenceEqualizer,"""Welp, Reni left us. Guess we have to amputate Zen's leg"""
09-12-2017T21:01:23,MetalAppleSauce,"there's like 5 amateur magic users among the group, i'm sure if they could telepoert they would"
09-12-2017T21:01:26,qwe304,"he did before, without and black magic stuff"
09-12-2017T21:01:46,MetalAppleSauce,have we even seen trace teleport yet?
09-12-2017T21:02:03,PalmettoPathfinder1,Yes he did.
09-12-2017T21:02:04,BadFoMo,"@FenceEqualizer Hey, that's on my list of sketch requests!"
09-12-2017T21:02:05,qwe304,"he can use magic, black mana is produced when too much magic energy is drawn from the earth at a particular location"
09-12-2017T21:02:16,Starflight,Black mana hella bad
09-12-2017T21:02:18,Sarandiel,Wait but they're at the hot springs
09-12-2017T21:02:19,MetalAppleSauce,i know but have we seen him teleport specifically
09-12-2017T21:02:20,MarvTheHugPharaoh,FoMo  D:
09-12-2017T21:02:21,qwe304,@MetalAppleSauce in the early chapters yes
09-12-2017T21:02:23,PalmettoPathfinder1,It was way back in the beginning.
09-12-2017T21:02:29,FenceEqualizer,:ptv-confused: Well then.
09-12-2017T21:02:30,Ordithus,He used magic back in town to save Adira
09-12-2017T21:02:34,qwe304,i can get the page in a sec
09-12-2017T21:02:34,Sarandiel,THere's a ton of magic. Foreshadowing that Trace has lots to draw on?
09-12-2017T21:02:36,Starflight,I'll admit it that was super duper edgy too.
09-12-2017T21:03:02,Tempystral,Didn't it get worse last time he used regular magic?
09-12-2017T21:03:05,Dinoman515,Weeeeee
09-12-2017T21:03:10,Starflight,Yeah it did.
09-12-2017T21:03:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,&lt;3 too cute
09-12-2017T21:03:26,Starflight,He's got a black glove covering his (left?) hand.
09-12-2017T21:03:33,MetalAppleSauce,left yes
09-12-2017T21:03:35,Combak,Nora told Trace not to use magic to prevent the black mana from spreading.
09-12-2017T21:03:35,MarshallMelon,I thought the implication was the only way to get that much power so quickly was by using Black Mana
09-12-2017T21:03:38,Starflight,Said hand is a black claw.
09-12-2017T21:03:44,Sarandiel,"Thought regular magic was ok, he just exhausted what was available from the surroundings"
09-12-2017T21:03:46,Ordithus,"@MarvTheHugPharaoh Adorable, even."
09-12-2017T21:03:48,qwe304,not necesarily dark mana tho
09-12-2017T21:03:53,BadFoMo,"@FenceEqualizer @MarvTheHugPharaoh Well, sort of. It's just Zen with a peg-leg."
09-12-2017T21:03:55,PalmettoPathfinder1,http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/140/
09-12-2017T21:04:11,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Here's the pic, although that might be the wrong one."
09-12-2017T21:04:12,CrRAR,aww
09-12-2017T21:04:16,Starflight,Teleporting proof
09-12-2017T21:04:25,MetalAppleSauce,oh yeah that happened
09-12-2017T21:04:30,Sarandiel,lol that scene
09-12-2017T21:04:33,CrRAR,cute
09-12-2017T21:04:36,Starflight,"And while non-canon, we saw in that one sketch where trace brought Laura back."
09-12-2017T21:04:38,TheBeckoner,Looks good Tom
09-12-2017T21:04:38,MarvTheHugPharaoh,&lt;3
09-12-2017T21:04:40,Starflight,Dunno how
09-12-2017T21:04:56,FenceEqualizer,Black magic
09-12-2017T21:04:58,Starflight,But he got even more demonized.
09-12-2017T21:05:02,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
09-12-2017T21:05:04,Ordithus,"More recent, but is that black magic or not... http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/918/"
09-12-2017T21:05:15,MviluUatusun,"Obviously, the one lying down is Raine.  LOL."
09-12-2017T21:05:16,BadFoMo,ME?!
09-12-2017T21:05:17,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Amazing Tom
09-12-2017T21:05:24,BadFoMo,Thank you.
09-12-2017T21:05:25,Ordithus,lol Tom
09-12-2017T21:05:40,MidnightBlue78,love the chest floof on Raine
09-12-2017T21:05:50,Starflight,"It's not black magic, but just normal magic @Ordithus"
09-12-2017T21:06:02,MetalAppleSauce,And it isn't teleportation. just a sheild
09-12-2017T21:06:06,Starflight,I think using any magic will cause the corruption on trace's body to spread.
09-12-2017T21:06:10,unsteddyphoenix,"It kinda looks like she said ""fwuffy"""
09-12-2017T21:06:20,Starflight,Which is why he's avoiding it so much.
09-12-2017T21:06:20,qwe304,no that was teleporting
09-12-2017T21:06:24,MviluUatusun,"However, is that Sythe or Zen holding her."
09-12-2017T21:06:25,Twokinds,She's apparently been partaking in the nog too
09-12-2017T21:06:26,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"""fwffy"""
09-12-2017T21:06:30,TorqueEmUp,Fluffybutt

09-12-2017T21:06:39,MetalAppleSauce,Nog! Mine!
09-12-2017T21:06:46,Tempystral,Oh man I forgot
09-12-2017T21:06:47,WereKeidran,"@Starflight, i don't know, the fact that his hand got worse because of it might indicat3e black magic"
09-12-2017T21:06:50,FenceEqualizer,Who spiking the nog?!
09-12-2017T21:06:51,Sarandiel,At least she didn't hit her NOGGIN
09-12-2017T21:06:51,Starflight,BEGIN THE NOG CHANT FOR NOG.

09-12-2017T21:35:44,unsteddyphoenix,"Well, now we've figured out who has the accents."
09-12-2017T21:35:48,MetalAppleSauce,And now i'm thinking of keidran-trump
09-12-2017T21:35:48,BadFoMo,Who built a wall?
09-12-2017T21:35:50,MarshallMelon,Oh jeez you ain't kitten

09-12-2017T21:36:29,unsteddyphoenix,Thats a bigger reaction than when people call trace furryhitler

09-12-2017T21:37:04,iZute,oh please dont let this chat become cancer again ;-;
09-12-2017T21:37:05,nekoanon,and stay away from mspa
09-12-2017T21:37:30,MetalAppleSauce,"reading evil trace's personality on the site, i'm pretty sure evil trace is much, much worse than hitler"
09-12-2017T21:37:39,unsteddyphoenix,eehhhhh...
09-12-2017T21:37:40,MetalAppleSauce,considering he doesn't discriminate
09-12-2017T21:37:45,DontuDare,did someone say Cancer
09-12-2017T21:37:49,MetalAppleSauce,"""Trace is a heartless killer, who wants nothing less than the death of all peoples. He doesn't care for any life."""
09-12-2017T21:37:56,TheJashter,XD
09-12-2017T21:37:59,Xexanoth,"go reread the comic, but read all of Traces lines in hitlers Voice = Hilarious"
09-12-2017T21:38:02,FenceEqualizer,"Don't know, he spared Laura."
09-12-2017T21:38:11,iZute,@DontuDane NO PLEASE
09-12-2017T21:38:14,Dadrobit,You realize Hitler targeted more than one type of person right? It was pretty broad.
09-12-2017T21:38:45,iZute,idid i really spell a name wrong when omg why
09-12-2017T21:39:23,TheJashter,"Gypsies, disabled, Jews, pretty much anyone who wouldnt conform to the party's values"
09-12-2017T21:39:40,MarshallMelon,Eugenics. Fun stuff.
09-12-2017T21:39:57,MetalAppleSauce,Yes but Trace worked alone aside from the templar (which isn't actually that many people)
09-12-2017T21:40:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"I'm gonna go get food, see ya Werido's later &lt;3"
09-12-2017T21:40:26,TheJashter,Seeya marv!
09-12-2017T21:40:26,Dadrobit,Cya Marvel.
09-12-2017T21:40:29,iZute,well hitler pretty much became the standard for super evil leader
09-12-2017T21:40:33,unsteddyphoenix,later
09-12-2017T21:40:34,iZute,see ya marv!
09-12-2017T21:40:37,MidnightBlue78,seeya Marvie
09-12-2017T21:40:40,MarshallMelon,Stalin technically killed more
09-12-2017T21:40:41,MetalAppleSauce,down to 47 :/
09-12-2017T21:40:44,MarshallMelon,"Like, a LOT more"
09-12-2017T21:40:49,PalmettoPathfinder1,He also targeted gays and blacks.
09-12-2017T21:40:52,MetalAppleSauce,yes but roses are red
09-12-2017T21:40:55,MetalAppleSauce,violets are blue
09-12-2017T21:40:56,Twokinds,Trace did nothing wrong.
09-12-2017T21:41:04,Xexanoth,FAKE NEWS!
09-12-2017T21:41:04,PalmettoPathfinder1,Wait what!?!
09-12-2017T21:41:06,TheJashter,XD
09-12-2017T21:41:06,MetalAppleSauce,there's always an asian better than you
09-12-2017T21:41:07,unsteddyphoenix,tbh agreed
09-12-2017T21:41:22,unsteddyphoenix,Keidran propaganda
09-12-2017T21:41:33,Dadrobit,Trace was framed.
09-12-2017T21:41:42,PalmettoPathfinder1,Didn't Trace also kill other humans as well?
09-12-2017T21:41:45,Bgrmystr2,tom pls lol
09-12-2017T21:41:53,MarshallMelon,Trace is a cool guy. Eh kills keydrins and doesn't afraid of anything.
09-12-2017T21:41:57,unsteddyphoenix,he was an equal-oppertunity killer
09-12-2017T21:42:09,TheJashter,It was all Euchre's plan! Dirty keidran!
09-12-2017T21:42:14,Bgrmystr2,xD Marshall
09-12-2017T21:42:15,MidnightBlue78,he's been wrongfully accused
09-12-2017T21:42:20,Twokinds,The previous regime was weak on national defense.
09-12-2017T21:42:23,Twokinds,Trace took charge.
09-12-2017T21:42:30,Twokinds,He cleaned up crime along the border.
09-12-2017T21:42:36,PalmettoPathfinder1,He went overboard though.
09-12-2017T21:42:36,unsteddyphoenix,So what youre saying is
09-12-2017T21:42:37,MetalAppleSauce,At least Hitler's followers actually followed him
09-12-2017T21:42:40,unsteddyphoenix,He made humans great again?
09-12-2017T21:42:45,Ordithus,Did he kiss babies?
09-12-2017T21:42:55,iZute,"wait someone probably remembers this but how did trace know his name when in the beginning he said ""Who am I?!"""
09-12-2017T21:42:57,Ordithus,Or did he punt them.
09-12-2017T21:42:59,Dadrobit,"He didn't go overboard, he was just an over-achiever."
09-12-2017T21:43:01,MidnightBlue78,"oh right, the wall and all lol"
09-12-2017T21:43:11,iZute,because i dont remember
09-12-2017T21:43:24,iZute,and i dont want to spend forever looking though the comic to find it
09-12-2017T21:43:27,PalmettoPathfinder1,"And now, humans are about to wipe out the Keidran and they almost did it to the Basitin (by making the Basitins wipe themselves out!)"
09-12-2017T21:43:28,unsteddyphoenix,He wasnt afraid to roll his sleeves up and do what he had to
09-12-2017T21:43:36,unsteddyphoenix,Gotta respect that
09-12-2017T21:43:49,Dadrobit,Neutral told him his name
09-12-2017T21:43:53,MidnightBlue78,a guy of morals and values
09-12-2017T21:43:57,Dadrobit,Literally 10 seconds of searching
09-12-2017T21:44:02,iZute,Ah thanks man
09-12-2017T21:44:07,Dadrobit,YW lol
09-12-2017T21:44:21,iZute,well i was starting from the very beginning from the comic and reading
09-12-2017T21:44:30,Dadrobit,Page 4
09-12-2017T21:44:32,TheJashter,"Only 2% on my battery, i'll brb"
09-12-2017T21:44:35,MetalAppleSauce,"Neutral didnt tell him his name, flora did"
09-12-2017T21:44:45,MetalAppleSauce,page 9
09-12-2017T21:44:46,BadFoMo,"Had to leave after that 'wall' bit, what did I miss?"
09-12-2017T21:44:53,Xexanoth,"List of Serial killers: ""This list is incomplete, you can help by expanding it"" - Trace: "" i got this"""
09-12-2017T21:44:55,MetalAppleSauce,neutral only said he was the grand templar
09-12-2017T21:45:04,ZahnHolley,Goodnight everyone sorry i havnt said anything i was busy.
09-12-2017T21:45:15,iZute,???
09-12-2017T21:45:19,TheJashter,Night Zahn!
09-12-2017T21:45:42,unsteddyphoenix,haha
09-12-2017T21:45:42,Dadrobit,"Sorry, only saw Master Templar, brain filled in Trace, page 9 it is"
09-12-2017T21:46:12,iZute,see ya man
09-12-2017T21:46:27,Dadrobit,o/ Zahn
09-12-2017T21:46:42,iZute,i checked and i couldnt find it :/
09-12-2017T21:46:45,iZute,i must be blind
09-12-2017T21:46:52,MetalAppleSauce,I'm confused on why trace hasn't talked with the templar since the tiger meeting
09-12-2017T21:47:21,MetalAppleSauce,"Since because of that, trace knows all currently living master templars are supposedly good guys"
09-12-2017T21:47:59,unsteddyphoenix,:thinking:
09-12-2017T21:48:04,Dadrobit,"""This shirt gets kinda uncomfortable against my fur after a while... Trace"""
09-12-2017T21:48:34,iZute,yea i just saw it
09-12-2017T21:48:44,iZute,Wait how did she know his name?
09-12-2017T21:48:55,iZute,also did trace know floras name?
09-12-2017T21:49:06,iZute,i dont think its been confirmed
09-12-2017T21:49:42,unsteddyphoenix,Whats this?
09-12-2017T21:49:49,MetalAppleSauce,"Brahn was at the meeting, Randal died at the basitin tower, Euchre is a friend, Trace personally saw Mary get freed from Ephemural, and Edmund repeatedly gives trace advantages"
09-12-2017T21:50:28,MarshallMelon,Master Mage is still AWOL
09-12-2017T21:50:37,MetalAppleSauce,Mary's the master mage
09-12-2017T21:50:52,MarshallMelon,I thought she was the previous Grand Master?
09-12-2017T21:51:02,Dadrobit,"Trace knowing Flora's name is never explained, but forum speculation says that it was likely an implant from Neutral."
09-12-2017T21:51:07,Ordithus,"She was the previous grand templar, who Trace lead the coup against."
09-12-2017T21:51:39,MetalAppleSauce,"Either way, ephemural no longer controls the current mage"
09-12-2017T21:51:50,Dadrobit,God I love/hate the internet: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3nfweteZck
09-12-2017T21:51:59,MetalAppleSauce,since he moved on to flora and fucked it up
09-12-2017T21:51:59,unsteddyphoenix,Dont know that for sure
09-12-2017T21:52:14,MarshallMelon,That old character sheet kinda hints at MM and Chaos having some kind of bond
09-12-2017T21:52:23,MarshallMelon,Wouldn't be surprised if that shows up
09-12-2017T21:52:28,Ordithus,"Neutral went from Mary to Flora, then got beat up."
09-12-2017T21:52:44,unsteddyphoenix,"Chaos would be the ""human"" mask"
09-12-2017T21:52:47,unsteddyphoenix,Probably
09-12-2017T21:52:58,unsteddyphoenix,the human-sponsoring mask
09-12-2017T21:52:59,MarshallMelon,He's certainly the dickish one
09-12-2017T21:53:14,RandomTKLover,Trace and co were the ones who attacked floras caravan with sythe. Probably because he knew that a felid-canid aliance would be too powerful to go to war against
09-12-2017T21:53:21,RandomTKLover,I think
09-12-2017T21:53:53,MetalAppleSauce,the masks as a whole havent appeared for exactly 800 pages
09-12-2017T21:54:07,RandomTKLover,Just finished chapter 6-2 again
09-12-2017T21:54:21,RandomTKLover,Also not true
09-12-2017T21:54:28,TheJashter,?
09-12-2017T21:54:43,MetalAppleSauce,their last appearance was page 206
09-12-2017T21:54:44,RandomTKLover,Who do you think the smoke hallucinations were?
09-12-2017T21:55:09,Dadrobit,Old Trace/Chaos
09-12-2017T21:55:26,RandomTKLover,Cahos is a mask right?
09-12-2017T21:55:35,DontuDare,ahhh migraine
09-12-2017T21:55:40,MarshallMelon,"Chaos, Neutral, Order"
09-12-2017T21:55:44,MarshallMelon,"Or at least, we assume"
09-12-2017T21:55:56,RandomTKLover,"Yep, those that we know of"
09-12-2017T21:56:09,MarshallMelon,Man we need to get Doctor Fate in here pronto
09-12-2017T21:56:15,Twokinds,And Heart
09-12-2017T21:56:18,MarshallMelon,All this talk of Order and Chaos
09-12-2017T21:56:34,RandomTKLover,Heart?
09-12-2017T21:56:35,Dadrobit,"Yeah, completely personal speculation: Chaos came to Trace in his time of grief and influenced him, pushing him to Evil Trace much like what Neutral did to Flora."
09-12-2017T21:56:44,Ordithus,"Ah yes, the Mike Mask."
09-12-2017T21:57:01,unsteddyphoenix,What happened to the mask of love and friendship?
09-12-2017T21:57:07,RandomTKLover,Tom can you confirm my first statement?
09-12-2017T21:57:19,Dadrobit,Banned for using loaded die
09-12-2017T21:57:31,MarshallMelon,It found its way to a tropical island and had to help a genetically modified bandicoot save the world
09-12-2017T21:57:43,MetalAppleSauce,Stop
09-12-2017T21:57:46,Ordithus,Mike is heart mask confirmed https://twokinds.deviantart.com/art/Captain-Twokinds-506330262
09-12-2017T21:58:11,RandomTKLover,Is heart a mask?
09-12-2017T21:58:20,MetalAppleSauce,"according to what tom just said, yes"
09-12-2017T21:58:27,Ordithus,And Tom never jokes.
09-12-2017T21:58:27,RandomTKLover,Ohhh
09-12-2017T21:58:30,MarshallMelon,It's as much a mask as mayonnaise is an instrument
09-12-2017T21:58:38,RandomTKLover,Plot addition
09-12-2017T21:58:42,MetalAppleSauce,"it is, marshall"
09-12-2017T21:58:55,MarshallMelon,But what about horseradish?
09-12-2017T21:58:58,Dadrobit,"Gimme a microphone and a pitch shifter, and I'll make that Mayo sing"
09-12-2017T21:58:58,TheJashter,"Viable instrument, I saw someone play All Star on Mayo"
09-12-2017T21:59:08,Ordithus,lol Robit
09-12-2017T21:59:14,MidnightBlue78,heart? That reminded me of captain planet
09-12-2017T21:59:19,MetalAppleSauce,I saw someone play allstar on horseradish too
09-12-2017T21:59:21,iZute,ahh that was a beautiful video jash

09-12-2017T22:06:06,iZute,like really good
09-12-2017T22:07:03,MetalAppleSauce,i still think page 727 is best page and should have been canon :P
09-12-2017T22:07:14,MetalAppleSauce,http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/727/
09-12-2017T22:07:33,iZute,YES
09-12-2017T22:07:34,MetalAppleSauce,"i mean, it was the only april fools page to be on the main site..."
09-12-2017T22:07:38,iZute,SHOULD BE CANON
09-12-2017T22:07:44,Dinoman515,"Is almost done with his Char, but realizes... The hardest part is yet to come..."
09-12-2017T22:08:13,iZute,SCALES?!
09-12-2017T22:08:21,TheJashter,O NO

09-12-2017T22:08:47,TheJashter,@metalapplesauce MY SHIP
09-12-2017T22:08:51,Dinoman515,"Coloring... its just the proto-type, remember..."
09-12-2017T22:09:16,MetalAppleSauce,i also think the way red acted in the second last panel confirms Red x Raine to be canon
09-12-2017T22:09:39,iZute,did you know when i was reading the 727 page i was thinking it was real until the end
09-12-2017T22:09:45,MetalAppleSauce,as did i
09-12-2017T22:09:54,iZute,because it wouldkinda make sense because look at the two!
09-12-2017T22:09:55,MetalAppleSauce,"i was like ""wait... wait really? holy shit!"""
09-12-2017T22:10:02,TheJashter,"I hope so, it'd be great to have the guy who hates Keidran end up falling in love with a girl who turns into a keidran"
09-12-2017T22:10:05,iZute,red hair and green eyes!?
09-12-2017T22:10:08,iZute,they both have em!
09-12-2017T22:10:15,TheJashter,"Woops, i let my tongue slip"
09-12-2017T22:10:16,DarthRexKing,Goodnight!
09-12-2017T22:10:20,iZute,(the non mom and non child)
09-12-2017T22:10:24,iZute,see ya man
09-12-2017T22:10:32,TheJashter,Gnight DarthRexKing!
09-12-2017T22:11:05,Dadrobit,o/
09-12-2017T22:11:20,Dinoman515,Qwe?!
09-12-2017T22:11:22,MetalAppleSauce,"i'm waiting for wolf red to re-canonize, and then rose recognizes him when they all go back to the estate"
09-12-2017T22:11:32,TheJashter,XD
09-12-2017T22:11:43,Dinoman515,OwO
09-12-2017T22:11:50,Dinoman515,Yes..
09-12-2017T22:12:01,iZute,please...
09-12-2017T22:12:36,TheJashter,"But, mah ship!"
09-12-2017T22:13:05,Dinoman515,..?
09-12-2017T22:13:13,TheJashter,Red x Raine!
09-12-2017T22:13:19,iZute,BUT KEIDRIEN RED
09-12-2017T22:13:29,Dinoman515,OeO
09-12-2017T22:14:10,MetalAppleSauce,"i feel like wolf red will happen, but the circumstances will be different (eg. nora makes it a thing)"
09-12-2017T22:14:28,TheJashter,XD
09-12-2017T22:14:34,TheJashter,I could see that though
09-12-2017T22:14:41,iZute,mhm!
09-12-2017T22:14:41,MetalAppleSauce,and a goodway for those circumstances to happen would be a certain spell in a certain estate's floor
09-12-2017T22:14:52,MetalAppleSauce,casted by a certain dragon
09-12-2017T22:15:26,Dadrobit,"Sorry, but Red is already taken by the alchemist."
09-12-2017T22:15:49,Dadrobit,"Clearly, the one true ship for him."
09-12-2017T22:15:55,Dinoman515,The only similarity between them is that their names bith start with R...
09-12-2017T22:16:07,MetalAppleSauce,and their hair
09-12-2017T22:16:10,MetalAppleSauce,and eyes
09-12-2017T22:16:27,TheJashter,Mhm
09-12-2017T22:16:38,MetalAppleSauce,and that every time red has been imagined as a keidran (by anyone that wasn't himself) he was a white wolf
09-12-2017T22:16:50,TheJashter,But I wonder about aging lineups here too
09-12-2017T22:17:06,TheJashter,"I mean, rose is kinda old at this point, in her 20s"
09-12-2017T22:17:15,MetalAppleSauce,i say anyone other than him because of this:
09-12-2017T22:17:16,MetalAppleSauce,http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/721/
09-12-2017T22:17:22,iZute,im not even paying ataention im just singing to some song so whats happening?
09-12-2017T22:17:42,MetalAppleSauce,"we're talking about how wolf-red can still happen, despite the april fools"
09-12-2017T22:18:27,unsteddyphoenix,Someone being magically transformed into the thing that they discriminate against?
09-12-2017T22:18:27,TheJashter,He can't be related to Raine though. Mah ship gotta sail mang
09-12-2017T22:18:33,unsteddyphoenix,Could work
09-12-2017T22:18:44,iZute,oh god i hope it still happens
09-12-2017T22:18:52,TheJashter,"I like the idea, bring some dragon magic into his life :3"
09-12-2017T22:18:58,MetalAppleSauce,It could happen
09-12-2017T22:19:02,iZute,^u^
09-12-2017T22:19:10,Dadrobit,"Well, Jaster, depending on your ""views"" you might still think it could work...."
09-12-2017T22:19:47,TheJashter,"I don't approve of that, Dad xD"
09-12-2017T22:20:29,MetalAppleSauce,Because of a certain dragon casting a certain trap in a certain floor in a certain estate that a certain group of people are going back to within the next chapter
09-12-2017T22:20:47,Dadrobit,"Too bad for you then, sorry, don't know what else to tell you."
09-12-2017T22:20:53,TheJashter,"So, if Trace forgets to invite them in..."
09-12-2017T22:21:10,MetalAppleSauce,Trace doesn't even know about the trap
09-12-2017T22:21:56,MetalAppleSauce,Rose just happened to have answered the door
09-12-2017T22:22:37,TheJashter,"It's possible, I wanna see it happen. :3"
09-12-2017T22:24:42,MetalAppleSauce,i keep looking at the banner on the top of the keenspot site and thinking that lynn has two sets of ears... damn you nibbly!
09-12-2017T22:25:08,iZute,XD
09-12-2017T22:25:14,iZute,i just noticed that XD
09-12-2017T22:25:15,TheJashter,XD
09-12-2017T22:25:18,Dadrobit,"It works off of intent of the guest, and some for of connection to Trace's view of an individual that does not require his physical presence."
09-12-2017T22:25:38,Dadrobit,form*
09-12-2017T22:26:28,iZute,hey has anyone else heard of Mystery Skulls?
09-12-2017T22:26:46,iZute,(by mysteryben27)
09-12-2017T22:27:11,TheJashter,The music videos he animates are pretty cool :3
09-12-2017T22:27:33,iZute,have you heard Freaking out? UHH SO GOOOD
09-12-2017T22:27:41,TheJashter,"And that's an interesting spell mechanic, basing things off of the victim's intent"
09-12-2017T22:28:02,TheJashter,"I prefer Ghost, imo xD Freaking out is pretty cool too"
09-12-2017T22:28:22,iZute,i like ghost because to me its more fun to sing ^u^
09-12-2017T22:28:57,MetalAppleSauce,"If that was the case, the templar in the most recent page should have been allowed in"
09-12-2017T22:29:09,MetalAppleSauce,so its not built on victim intent
09-12-2017T22:29:51,MetalAppleSauce,cuz the trap was set when trace was still evil
09-12-2017T22:30:01,iZute,hey i just found this and i have a feeling you will all enjoy this XD
09-12-2017T22:30:07,iZute,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aneAWxzOUk
09-12-2017T22:30:43,DontuDare,-__-

09-12-2017T22:32:39,MetalAppleSauce,"Excuses excuses. what do you identify as, dino?"
09-12-2017T22:32:48,Dinoman515,O_O
09-12-2017T22:32:49,Dadrobit,"There was no mention that the values of the trap are relegated to being a static representation of the ideologies of Trace at the time it was formed, just that the connection is there and it may be ongoing, thus they were poofed."
09-12-2017T22:33:05,Dinoman515,A Dinosaur...
09-12-2017T22:33:09,iZute,an chipotle burrito. thats what i identify as
09-12-2017T22:33:18,Dinoman515,O_o
09-12-2017T22:33:19,MetalAppleSauce,...what kind of dinosaur
09-12-2017T22:33:27,TheJashter,"I'll brb, but looks good Dino!"
09-12-2017T22:33:39,Dadrobit,"Furthermore, the ""Templar"" very well may not be real Templar, and the trap may be able to identify that."
09-12-2017T22:33:43,Dinoman515,Spinosaurus...
09-12-2017T22:34:06,Dinoman515,"OC's are getting weirder, ill tell you that..."
09-12-2017T22:34:18,MetalAppleSauce,how the hell did you pick up a pencil
09-12-2017T22:34:29,Dinoman515,Claws...
09-12-2017T22:34:34,MetalAppleSauce,all your claws face one way
09-12-2017T22:34:53,Dinoman515,It was like a tooth pick...
09-12-2017T22:35:17,TheJashter,Typing must be a nightmare XD
09-12-2017T22:35:30,Dinoman515,Plus I havent drawn in like... 4 years...
09-12-2017T22:35:41,Dinoman515,Keyboard...

09-12-2017T22:39:53,TheJashter,Bye Beck!
09-12-2017T22:40:19,iZute,realizes that he over estimated the size of the wave
09-12-2017T22:40:30,Dinoman515,O_o
09-12-2017T22:40:34,Dinoman515,No shet.
09-12-2017T22:40:46,TheJashter,"Well, estimations from where I am put the spinosaurus at several tonnes..."

09-12-2017T22:44:04,TheJashter,I can see things possible getting outta hand here XD

09-12-2017T22:44:39,MetalAppleSauce,de-summons the pail
09-12-2017T22:44:39,Dadrobit,Let's perhaps not let it go down that path again?
09-12-2017T22:44:50,Dadrobit,Yesterday was enough methinks
09-12-2017T22:44:56,TheJashter,Yes please
09-12-2017T22:44:57,Dinoman515,"Aww, why didnt you give it to meee?!"

09-12-2017T22:45:04,MetalAppleSauce,"Hmmmm, what's an efficient way to shoot water?"

09-12-2017T22:46:03,MetalAppleSauce,manifests a minigun specially designed to shoot mass amounts of water
09-12-2017T22:46:06,TheJashter,Those things are scary powerful though.
09-12-2017T22:46:12,Dadrobit,Shoot water? .22 is pretty cheap I guess.

09-12-2017T22:47:39,MetalAppleSauce,A minigun that shoots infinite water
09-12-2017T22:47:51,Dinoman515,"When you say minigun, i think of 8 pressure washers taped together..."
09-12-2017T22:48:14,MetalAppleSauce,"I think of an actual minigun, but designed as if it were a watergun"
09-12-2017T22:48:18,iZute,slowly sneaks out of the room out of fear
