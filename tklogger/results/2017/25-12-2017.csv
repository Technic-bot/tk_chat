25-12-2017T13:05:07,Combak,"Hey all. So, stream later today?"
25-12-2017T13:09:16,DevlNuK,Hello Guys! Good everning! =)
25-12-2017T14:52:02,TheBeckoner,Anybody else here reading slightly damned?
25-12-2017T14:52:07,TheBeckoner,good comic imo
25-12-2017T14:52:14,TheBeckoner,reading it for the second time
25-12-2017T14:55:36,RandomTKLover,I already read it 3 times
25-12-2017T14:56:10,TheBeckoner,It think  twokinds is the only thing Ive read 3 times.
25-12-2017T14:58:18,Combak,Slightly Damned is great. Combats with TK for my favorite webcomic often enough.
25-12-2017T14:58:35,Combak,Did you know the artist streams on Picarto?
25-12-2017T14:58:50,TheBeckoner,"ID rate them as equals tbh, although Toms art is better imo"
25-12-2017T14:58:57,TheBeckoner,They do?
25-12-2017T14:59:01,TheBeckoner,whats the channel?
25-12-2017T15:01:48,Combak,https://picarto.tv/raizap
25-12-2017T15:03:02,Combak,"Yeah, the better art part is what keeps TK as my favorite... along with a few other things."
25-12-2017T16:20:32,Combak,So...
25-12-2017T16:37:32,TorqueEmUp,Don't think anything is going to happen today either. :P
25-12-2017T16:41:50,Combak,"Well that sucks. :( I guess I'll keep the tab open until about 9:00 PM, just to be sure."
25-12-2017T17:13:17,TorqueEmUp,"Right, if anything is going to be streamed, it sure isn't going to be a sketch stream as there was never a sketch suggestion form posted on patreon."
25-12-2017T17:34:30,Dadrobit,"IIRC, Tom said that he'd try to take one of the Christmas suggestions and do it as a Christmas filler page. But nothing was guaranteed, and whether or not it'd be done on stream was not said, but I'd assume not."
