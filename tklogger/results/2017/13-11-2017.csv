13-11-2017T00:50:48,Bgrmystr2,Lol.. that made me think of that old show with the aggro crag
13-11-2017T00:50:56,Bgrmystr2,dunno why
13-11-2017T00:51:02,Bgrmystr2,"rhymed, I guess"
13-11-2017T00:51:24,Twokinds,"Oh man, Guts"
13-11-2017T00:51:29,Twokinds,Haven't thought of that in a while
13-11-2017T00:52:45,BadFoMo,"I /think/ I may have heard of it, but what is it?"
13-11-2017T00:53:02,Bgrmystr2,I liked that Guts as well as the other show w/ the bigass face and the totems and the coins.. and going through all the ancient civilization thing..
13-11-2017T00:53:10,Bgrmystr2,Damn if I could remember the name of it
13-11-2017T00:53:38,BadFoMo,Legend of the Hiden Temple!
13-11-2017T00:53:41,Bgrmystr2,"Guts was like.. action sports, sorta kinda competition, basically"
13-11-2017T00:53:44,Bgrmystr2,THAT'S IT
13-11-2017T00:53:49,Bgrmystr2,That thing was awesome
13-11-2017T00:54:11,Bgrmystr2,Guts was basically in the same vein vaguely speaking.
13-11-2017T00:54:15,Bgrmystr2,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickelodeon_Guts
13-11-2017T00:58:29,BadFoMo,I think I was more a Double Dare 2000 fan. Mostly due to being too young back then and not really having anything but PBS/WQED until early 2000.
13-11-2017T01:00:03,Bgrmystr2,I liked that too
13-11-2017T01:00:50,Bgrmystr2,watched the hell out of all those shows
13-11-2017T01:44:17,Twokinds,Same
13-11-2017T01:44:29,Twokinds,"90's kids, woo"

13-11-2017T22:37:12,BluePhantom90,"but Keith while asleep, in the comic he was hugging Nat vary tightly"
13-11-2017T22:38:14,BluePhantom90,"and Tom doing the ""morning wood"" joke with Nat"
13-11-2017T22:38:31,CrRAR,hehe
13-11-2017T22:39:18,CrRAR,"ohhh we're talking unconcious Keith, he's a rascal."
13-11-2017T22:39:28,BluePhantom90,yes.
13-11-2017T22:40:47,BluePhantom90,But Crimson and I have done our best to be original with the characters as possible. r-r did want to put like Reni got stuck in a Dream caused by Nora when she looking into Trace's dream as a joke
13-11-2017T22:41:12,BluePhantom90,*memories
13-11-2017T22:46:41,BluePhantom90,"lol Oh I looked up some of the idea's. One is when Flora pokes a Keidran their fur goes all ""Poof"" like with that Fluffy Kat sketch"

13-11-2017T22:54:20,BluePhantom90,e-e been talking about this thing since last year I believe
13-11-2017T22:57:17,BluePhantom90,-sighs- and so many things just got in the way or I been preoccupied doing other things.
13-11-2017T22:59:10,unsteddyphoenix,It took you a year and you got 5 pages?
13-11-2017T23:00:28,BluePhantom90,well it took like 1 month. But yeah a lot of crap just got us preoccupied. Some of it was mainly Army
