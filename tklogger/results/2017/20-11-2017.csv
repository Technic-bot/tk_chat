20-11-2017T01:01:15,Combak,"Hey, wait a second... What's that thing high up on the mountain?"
20-11-2017T01:02:24,Bgrmystr2,"Combak, you mean the thing at the top left of the mountainface?"
20-11-2017T01:02:59,Bgrmystr2,"structures of some type, as referenced by the older image tom posted earlier https://i.imgur.com/GzHVxTf.jpg"
20-11-2017T01:03:17,Combak,"I think so... A little- Oh, cool."
20-11-2017T01:03:27,Combak,Night! :p
20-11-2017T01:04:27,Bgrmystr2,:&gt; Interesting how the structure inside the wall section changed over time.
20-11-2017T01:05:48,Bgrmystr2,Also interesting.. the part of the village on the left side just kinda disappeared.
20-11-2017T01:07:15,Bgrmystr2,the structures and castle-lookin thing on the right side invisible'd too.
20-11-2017T01:29:10,qwe304,https://imgur.com/a/g49oD I knew someone would do it...

20-11-2017T11:53:30,TorqueEmUp,I doubt my internet has anything to do with your emotes. :P
20-11-2017T12:13:10,qwe304,"well the individual files themselves are perfectly synced, when they dont all download at the same time they will start out of sync"

20-11-2017T12:52:12,iliar,@qwe304 Maybe. But I think some people use different chat box size. For example they can use mobile phones. https://yadi.sk/i/BVjON2pf3PuLpd
20-11-2017T12:53:01,qwe304,@iliaron desktops unless you have the chat popped out (in my experience at least) the shat always is six emotes

20-11-2017T13:00:54,iliar,@qwe304 Yes. Six emotes default. But chat box can be resized. https://yadi.sk/i/jUyFXKai3PuMcu https://yadi.sk/i/e1_Pkn8E3PuMeH

20-11-2017T13:05:30,FenceEqualizer,One day i will purchase those emotes
20-11-2017T14:21:27,PalmettoPathfinder1,I hope Tom doesn't try to stream today. Not being rude here.  I'm just concerned about his hand.  Although he could train himself to draw with his other hand.  And when that hand starts hurting he can use his mouth to draw!
20-11-2017T14:23:33,PalmettoPathfinder1,Oh and Tom did you get my Patreon message?  I apologize that I got it sort of well late.
20-11-2017T14:24:04,PalmettoPathfinder1,Btw does anyone have the link to the Patreon pic of Nat and the rubber duck?
20-11-2017T14:24:19,PalmettoPathfinder1,Hello?  Anyone there?
20-11-2017T14:26:52,TorqueEmUp,"Mine was at default chat box size on my laptop, they weren't out of sync, just out of place."

20-11-2017T14:32:08,MidnightBlue78,heyo~
20-11-2017T14:33:28,PalmettoPathfinder1,So I'm trying to find the Patreon pic of Nat and the duck. The one where's she is mortified to be caught with
20-11-2017T14:33:31,PalmettoPathfinder1,It
20-11-2017T14:34:01,PalmettoPathfinder1,Stupid Patreon really needs a better mobile version
20-11-2017T14:36:09,MidnightBlue78,"ok, just go to Tom's last patreon post and under the sketch there are some tags, one of them says Natani. Click on it and it should bring up all sketches with Natani"
20-11-2017T14:36:38,MidnightBlue78,"i am mortified by a bird too, a turkey to be precise"
20-11-2017T14:37:07,MidnightBlue78,I hate cooking for Thanksgiving :ctwokinds-eyeroll:
20-11-2017T14:37:34,PalmettoPathfinder1,Yeah that's what I'm doing.  I know On the website there's a place you can view stuff sorted by month but on the mobile site no such option.
20-11-2017T14:38:23,PalmettoPathfinder1,And what's wrong with cooking for Thanksgiving? Well besides cooking all that food that is. My biggest thing doing for Thanksgiving is cleaning ones house!

20-11-2017T14:40:33,PalmettoPathfinder1,@Midnight Hmm...I guess that makes sense.
20-11-2017T14:41:20,PalmettoPathfinder1,You know I could have sworn that the one of Nat and the duck was colored. I could be mistaken though.
20-11-2017T14:41:54,MidnightBlue78,I guess I'll drink more coffee and deal with this sucker before I change my mind

20-11-2017T14:44:27,MidnightBlue78,Have fun!
20-11-2017T14:44:30,PalmettoPathfinder1,Turns out I had to change my request.  No Raine in a Body style line up since according to Tom there's a bit of a running gag in development of her being clothed even in Keidran form.  Tom apologized for that though. Turns out he likes doing line ups even
20-11-2017T14:44:39,PalmettoPathfinder1,Though they're a lot of work.
20-11-2017T14:45:44,MidnightBlue78,"Oh, he does?"
20-11-2017T14:45:50,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Plus if you look at it, both Adria and Raine have about the same body style (although granted Raine is not as fluffy as Adira)."
20-11-2017T14:46:45,PalmettoPathfinder1,And since the body style line ups are for different characters it really wouldn't make since to have another character with the same body style to appear.
20-11-2017T14:47:14,PalmettoPathfinder1,Yeah he likes doing them but they're a lot of work though.  So....
20-11-2017T14:49:25,PalmettoPathfinder1,"I opted to do a request of poor Keith finding himself in bed with Adelaide and Natani and wondering how the heck did this happen!  Also I saw in a name generator for D&D 5th edition sourcebook, Adeladie's name appears under the name list for Female"
20-11-2017T14:49:29,PalmettoPathfinder1,English names
20-11-2017T15:05:23,PalmettoPathfinder1,So i have another idea: the only being Nora is terrified of!

20-11-2017T15:29:00,Twokinds,Page 1 of Book 4
20-11-2017T15:29:22,qwe304,bonus pages i assume?
20-11-2017T15:29:36,qwe304,like book 1&2 had
20-11-2017T15:29:47,qwe304,cause i dont recognise that page
20-11-2017T15:30:00,Twokinds,Because otherwise this would be the first page of the book: http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/445/ Which feels like a pretty awkward start without an establishing shot.
20-11-2017T15:31:07,qwe304,"yeah, that wouldnt be a great start-off"
20-11-2017T15:31:22,Twokinds,"So this shows the outside of the tavern and Trace being dragged away by Basitins, then goes into Keith and Natani's room."
20-11-2017T15:31:32,qwe304,"thanks for the sneak peek, cant wait to get my little hands on a printed copy"

20-11-2017T15:33:43,TerraTheWizard,neat
20-11-2017T15:35:02,qwe304,are you going to try to reproduce your old style with this one? otherwise it will be a bit weird going suddenly between them
20-11-2017T15:36:39,Twokinds,"I will for the bottom two panels, but the top one, I'll make a little fancy."
20-11-2017T15:36:40,Twokinds,Why not.
20-11-2017T15:37:16,Twokinds,I already do it for the chapter titles. xD It'll be like the art progresses back to how it was before as the page progresses. Like an old video game going from fmv to gameplay.
20-11-2017T15:38:06,qwe304,"yeah, just gotta be carefull to not interupt the immersion too much"
20-11-2017T15:38:41,qwe304,are you still aiming for a late december launch?

20-11-2017T16:27:52,MidnightBlue78,You're not doing anything with the family? :ctwokinds-sadtrace2:
20-11-2017T16:27:58,Zakuru,i get that tom might be away from his family but...
20-11-2017T16:28:32,FenceEqualizer,Family in another state
20-11-2017T16:28:47,PalmettoPathfinder1,I'm looking forward to thanksgiving as I get to see my grandma.  Not looking forward to working at the bookstore on Black Friday though.
20-11-2017T16:29:10,MidnightBlue78,"oh, i thought they all lived in cincinnati"
20-11-2017T16:30:16,PalmettoPathfinder1,"And I'm also guessing no stream tonight as well.  That's alright.  Tom is probably letting his hand heal.  Although he could train himself to draw with his other hand, or his mouth.  I do recall reading of someone who taught himself to draw with his toes."
20-11-2017T16:30:26,MidnightBlue78,I hate black friday with a passion
20-11-2017T16:30:43,PalmettoPathfinder1,I agree.  Too much chaos.
20-11-2017T16:30:53,Zakuru,mark lives elsewhere for sure
20-11-2017T16:30:58,Zakuru,west coast maybe
20-11-2017T16:31:00,MidnightBlue78,i'm like whatever
20-11-2017T16:31:08,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"online black Friday is ok, but yeah to much chaos"
20-11-2017T16:31:15,Bgrmystr2,I've never gone out to buy stuff on black friday and don't ever plan to as long as I live around here.
20-11-2017T16:31:22,PalmettoPathfinder1,And mayhem.  People fighting over stuff and things of that nature.
20-11-2017T16:31:23,MidnightBlue78,"yeah, buy online instead"
20-11-2017T16:31:31,MidnightBlue78,Saves you the hassle
20-11-2017T16:31:35,Zakuru,imma participate in black friday when i have my money back
20-11-2017T16:31:56,PalmettoPathfinder1,Speaking of buying online I wonder if the Twokinds art book will be in PDF one day.
20-11-2017T16:32:05,Bgrmystr2,"most black friday sales are just stores selling off stuff they couldn't already sell normally, so they slash the prices off and people buy it"
20-11-2017T16:32:15,Bgrmystr2,partial profit is better than zero profit
20-11-2017T16:32:20,FenceEqualizer,There's something fun about the chaos of blackfriday though
20-11-2017T16:32:35,Bgrmystr2,tis why I avoid black friday sales anyway
20-11-2017T16:32:54,Bgrmystr2,"there's no actual quality items in it, people buy them so stores don't drop the costs of it"
20-11-2017T16:32:55,FenceEqualizer,At least there was till I worked retail. People are ready to fisticuff you if you don't have there items in stock
20-11-2017T16:32:56,PalmettoPathfinder1,And the people arrive in hordes to stampede because of said sales.
20-11-2017T16:33:15,Zakuru,i've been seeing less of that?
20-11-2017T16:34:11,PalmettoPathfinder1,Yep. I remember reading about that Walmart employee being trampled to death one year.  Even the police couldn't get to him because of the get now mentality of the shipper horde
20-11-2017T16:34:43,MidnightBlue78,people are worse than animals
20-11-2017T16:34:58,PalmettoPathfinder1,But yeah thankfully that sort of stuff is happening less these days because stores are offering Black Friday sales early.  Yep.
20-11-2017T16:34:59,MidnightBlue78,Just to save a couple of bucks
20-11-2017T16:35:07,MidnightBlue78,Its truly shameful
20-11-2017T16:35:23,Bgrmystr2,for sub-par items that they wouldn't normally buy at normal price anywa
20-11-2017T16:35:25,Bgrmystr2,anyway*
20-11-2017T16:35:30,FenceEqualizer,That's alright all about cyber monday. The fun of black Friday except not
20-11-2017T16:36:11,MidnightBlue78,"Oh, i just remembered today is Tom's patreon anniversary"
20-11-2017T16:36:19,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Hm....I got an idea for a request: Flora, Natani and Sythe commenting on how humans are hypocrites for calling Keidran animals while the three are observing several humans fighting over Black Friday sales."
20-11-2017T16:36:27,Bgrmystr2,"where I live, lots of people buy cheap simply because it's cheap, not because it's a good quality item that has a lower price."
20-11-2017T16:36:32,FenceEqualizer,._.
20-11-2017T16:36:47,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Happy anniversary Tom's Patreon :D
20-11-2017T16:36:59,MidnightBlue78,WOO HOO!!!!!
20-11-2017T16:37:05,Bgrmystr2,"maybe you should keep that idea and put it into the request page on patreon, palm?"
20-11-2017T16:37:05,PalmettoPathfinder1,@Bgrmystr2 what do you think of that idea?
20-11-2017T16:37:14,Bgrmystr2,instead of just blurting it out to everyone :P
20-11-2017T16:37:18,MidnightBlue78,Congratulations on many amazing sketches!!!
20-11-2017T16:37:58,PalmettoPathfinder1,Oh I don't mind.  I got so many request ideas it's a pain to keep up with them.  So I'm alright if someone else uses some of my ideas as inspiration.
20-11-2017T16:38:05,Bgrmystr2,And I think I'd keep my suggestions to myself.
20-11-2017T16:38:09,Bgrmystr2,"""Inspiration"" lol"
20-11-2017T16:38:23,FenceEqualizer,I...don't think that's...err nevermind
20-11-2017T16:38:48,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Well it's alright.    Anyhow, anyone got their houses decorated for Christmas."
20-11-2017T16:38:50,PalmettoPathfinder1,?
20-11-2017T16:39:05,MidnightBlue78,"pfff, nah"
20-11-2017T16:39:15,Bgrmystr2,"I would, but that would require work."
20-11-2017T16:39:24,Bgrmystr2,so I don't.
20-11-2017T16:39:45,Bgrmystr2,and I don't really use the rest of the house
20-11-2017T16:39:46,CanadianArts,What’s up
20-11-2017T16:39:55,PalmettoPathfinder1,Thank you Tom for all of the hard work you do.  Bgr that's just wrong.  Work is good for the soul and body!
20-11-2017T16:39:56,MidnightBlue78,oh hey
20-11-2017T16:40:03,Bgrmystr2,buuuuuut my desktop background is christmas themed
20-11-2017T16:40:12,Bgrmystr2,"screw that Palm, your face is wrong :v"
20-11-2017T16:40:35,Zakuru,my food is wrong
20-11-2017T16:40:43,CanadianArts,Ok who has at least one picture of two kinds on there phone or laptop saved :v
20-11-2017T16:40:52,Zakuru,nein
20-11-2017T16:40:52,PalmettoPathfinder1,Okay I'll count your desktop as Christmas themed as counting.  Actually while I'm 33 people say I look like I'm 22.
20-11-2017T16:40:58,Bgrmystr2,"Basically, I'm not going to work for something in my own house if I don't normally spend the time going around and appreciating it. xD"
20-11-2017T16:41:28,Bgrmystr2,"I appreciate stuff in my room, and don't spend a lot of time elsewhere"
20-11-2017T16:41:51,Bgrmystr2,"food, maybe, but eh"
20-11-2017T16:41:59,MidnightBlue78,My sister put up a black christams tree
20-11-2017T16:42:10,Bgrmystr2,I decorate my desktop wallpapers and such for events such as halloween or christmas.
20-11-2017T16:42:18,Bgrmystr2,tis how I decorate.
20-11-2017T16:42:18,MidnightBlue78,i'm like Ok emo girl whatever
20-11-2017T16:42:24,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Okay.  Well, I'm stuck in Walmart waiting to check out.  Had to get some hangers and command strips for garland."
20-11-2017T16:43:20,qwe304,@CanadianArts I have hundreds saved... i have the whole comic on my ipod as well...
20-11-2017T16:43:31,Bgrmystr2,"yknow, palm.. I used to spend 4-6 hours helping my mom put up decorations for christmas every year when I was a kid"
20-11-2017T16:43:38,Bgrmystr2,if not even longer than that
20-11-2017T16:43:49,Bgrmystr2,and I got to spend all but maybe a half hour to one hour appreciating it
20-11-2017T16:44:01,Bgrmystr2,because presents on xmas morning
20-11-2017T16:44:11,Bgrmystr2,and that was really it.
20-11-2017T16:44:28,Bgrmystr2,eh :ptv-uneasy:
20-11-2017T16:45:20,PalmettoPathfinder1,I think that's why you should decorate way ahead of time to appreciate it but I can understand what you mean.
20-11-2017T16:45:39,Bgrmystr2,"but that, again, requires so much effort for very little reward"
20-11-2017T16:45:51,Bgrmystr2,I don't think the tradeoff is worth it
20-11-2017T16:46:11,MidnightBlue78,"yeah, just like a said earlier about cooking on thanksgiving"
20-11-2017T16:46:46,MidnightBlue78,You slave for hours cooking and everyone eats in the blink of an eye
20-11-2017T16:47:02,MidnightBlue78,and then comes the clean up that takes forever
20-11-2017T16:47:20,MidnightBlue78,"But, people gotta eat anyway so..."
20-11-2017T16:47:48,PalmettoPathfinder1,Yeah the cleanup is a pain I'll agree with
20-11-2017T16:47:50,PalmettoPathfinder1,You
20-11-2017T16:48:11,MidnightBlue78,I think i have thanksgiving ptsd i swear lol
20-11-2017T16:48:50,Bgrmystr2,"exactly, tis why I would just leave the tree up all year"
20-11-2017T16:48:55,Bgrmystr2,or just not decorate
20-11-2017T16:49:17,Bgrmystr2,"if atmosphere is THAT important, leave it up"
20-11-2017T16:49:31,Bgrmystr2,"if it's not, then it's unnecessary"
20-11-2017T16:51:06,MidnightBlue78,christmas trees just take up space
20-11-2017T16:51:24,Bgrmystr2,"nah, if you dedicate a place specifically for the tree then it won't"
20-11-2017T16:51:36,Bgrmystr2,"but if you don't plan for the tree when planning your house in general, then it's gonna conflict"
20-11-2017T16:51:52,FenceEqualizer,But for the two months you have it up it's awesome
20-11-2017T16:52:11,Bgrmystr2,"Bah, give me a year-round tree or no tree at all."
20-11-2017T16:52:51,Bgrmystr2,To tree.. or not to tree :v
20-11-2017T16:53:12,MidnightBlue78,no tree
20-11-2017T16:55:01,Bgrmystr2,"personally, I'd rather a tree year round cuz I like christmas, but hate taking everything down"
20-11-2017T17:07:59,Dadrobit,Back from class.
