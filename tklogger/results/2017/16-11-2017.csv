16-11-2017T22:47:08,Pepethecat,Stupid mobile typing..
16-11-2017T22:47:15,ZRO4825,"It's like when you get a picture, and you think it's a snow leopard, and you're all happy. And then you find out someone's a butt and left the black & white filter on and it's actually just a normal leopard."
16-11-2017T22:47:15,Bgrmystr2,"Friday has always been stream longer than sunday streams existed, bro"

16-11-2017T22:47:54,ZRO4825,"I don't know myself, since I'm on Sage's channel~"
16-11-2017T22:47:55,Bgrmystr2,"yes, zro it is"
16-11-2017T22:48:05,Ordithus,"zro, it is if you're based on Tom's stream"
16-11-2017T22:48:20,Bgrmystr2,it's defined by what channel you're on
16-11-2017T22:48:32,ZRO4825,Why yes. Yes it is.
16-11-2017T22:48:34,Bgrmystr2,"long as you're on that channel, it has the banner till you close it out"
16-11-2017T22:48:46,ZRO4825,"Thus why I asked if it was on there during multi-streams, since I'm NOT on that channel to double check. :P"
16-11-2017T22:49:02,Pepethecat,Okay im on my desktop
16-11-2017T22:49:02,Bgrmystr2,can confirm it's there
16-11-2017T22:49:14,ZRO4825,"Damnit, get off the desk!"
16-11-2017T22:49:23,ZRO4825,That's where the computer goes! D:
16-11-2017T22:49:24,SpotTheLeopard,ZRO ;__; I would be sad if it were not a snow leopard
16-11-2017T22:49:28,ZRO4825,RIGHT?
16-11-2017T22:49:28,Bgrmystr2,computer monitors and keyboards go there too lool
16-11-2017T22:49:35,Pepethecat,"I need answers, Since when does he stream on Fridays and Wedsday!?!?"

16-11-2017T22:50:11,unsteddyphoenix,Ok but since WHEN?
16-11-2017T22:50:26,Bgrmystr2,Sunday streams are only about a year old. Friday streams have been going on for much longer than I've been around lol
16-11-2017T22:50:33,Bgrmystr2,"also, phoenix you don't get to ask that question"
16-11-2017T22:50:36,Bgrmystr2,you've BEEN here
16-11-2017T22:50:39,Bgrmystr2,you know.
16-11-2017T22:51:00,ZRO4825,Prepare the phoenix steadying machine....
16-11-2017T22:51:04,Pepethecat,Is he drawing a comic or art rn?
16-11-2017T22:51:05,unsteddyphoenix,Bgr I NEEEED answers~
16-11-2017T22:51:07,SageSaga,Tom has been streaming with me on Friday for over a year now
16-11-2017T22:51:19,Bgrmystr2,"at least a year and a half, I think"
16-11-2017T22:51:23,Bgrmystr2,since I've seen
16-11-2017T22:51:24,MarshallMelon,"Comic. It says it on the stream, bucko"
16-11-2017T22:51:29,Pepethecat,Uh.. I never noticed.
16-11-2017T22:51:34,MarshallMelon,Situational awareness -6/10
16-11-2017T22:51:36,Bgrmystr2,yeh says on bottom left of the stream
16-11-2017T22:51:37,CrRAR,Comic = art lol
16-11-2017T22:51:49,Bgrmystr2,"A comic is art, yes"
16-11-2017T22:51:53,CrRAR,but I catch yur drift
16-11-2017T22:51:55,ZRO4825,Don't you lie to me and get my hopes up spouting that kind of nonsense CrRAR o_o
16-11-2017T22:52:06,unsteddyphoenix,Uh.
16-11-2017T22:52:08,CrRAR,haha
16-11-2017T22:52:22,Bgrmystr2,"usually says the song playing, but today is robocop soundtrack."
16-11-2017T22:52:25,Bgrmystr2,apparently.
16-11-2017T22:52:26,Pepethecat,Yeah I realized it says that on the buttom. But it also says on top of chat that comic is on Wednesdays -_-
16-11-2017T22:52:27,Twokinds,lol
16-11-2017T22:52:33,Twokinds,Yeah that's because of Firefox's update
16-11-2017T22:52:36,Twokinds,It broke the plugin
16-11-2017T22:52:42,SageSaga,my comic hit 2000+ pages
16-11-2017T22:52:42,Bgrmystr2,ahhh yeah
16-11-2017T22:52:42,ZRO4825,Damnit Firefox!
16-11-2017T22:52:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,curse you Mike
16-11-2017T22:52:45,MarshallMelon,Robocop is love though
16-11-2017T22:52:46,unsteddyphoenix,hah rip
16-11-2017T22:52:49,Bgrmystr2,I rolled the update backwards
16-11-2017T22:52:56,Bgrmystr2,and turned off the autoupdate
16-11-2017T22:52:58,ZRO4825,Shoulda been Mozilla SnowLeopard. Then if it DID break it'd just turn into floof.
16-11-2017T22:53:03,Ordithus,"congrats, sage"
16-11-2017T22:53:05,MarshallMelon,I've been using an outdate version for months now
16-11-2017T22:53:11,Bgrmystr2,"then you'd never find anything useful, zro"
16-11-2017T22:53:12,MarshallMelon,50 borked my extensions
16-11-2017T22:53:15,Bgrmystr2,too much fur
16-11-2017T22:53:21,CrRAR,Their update schedule is whack
16-11-2017T22:53:25,MarshallMelon,"*outdated, crap"
16-11-2017T22:53:26,ZRO4825,There is no such thing you heretic! o_O
16-11-2017T22:53:39,Serpentfrog,Too much fur? Just download more RAM.
16-11-2017T22:53:45,CrRAR,Ever since like 2010 it's so dumb
16-11-2017T22:53:50,Bgrmystr2,lool
16-11-2017T22:53:57,Bgrmystr2,"I can't stop the FurMark, Serp"
16-11-2017T22:54:01,Bgrmystr2,it's too much
16-11-2017T22:54:05,CrRAR,Software should NEVER be version 60
16-11-2017T22:54:06,MarshallMelon,RAM = Really Adventurous Mews?
16-11-2017T22:54:08,Bgrmystr2,it generates ALL the fur
16-11-2017T22:54:09,CrRAR,It's just WEIRD
16-11-2017T22:54:14,ZRO4825,"Mozilla Snep. Now with more RAM needed, to control your floof."
16-11-2017T22:54:20,Serpentfrog,"Regular, average man."
16-11-2017T22:54:26,unsteddyphoenix,Keeps you on your toes
16-11-2017T22:54:40,Supahbuzzer,"spoiler alert: natani gets pissed cause of zen knocked unconsious, blames team b, bites raine, raine transforms again and big fight occurs and teams end up dividing."
16-11-2017T22:54:58,Pepethecat,Oh well.. Now I know that I can see pages before they are even done.
16-11-2017T22:55:05,MarvTheHugPharaoh,How about Natani Bites red
16-11-2017T22:55:08,SageSaga,you are bad at writing fake spoilers
16-11-2017T22:55:12,MarvTheHugPharaoh,cause that would be funny
16-11-2017T22:55:14,Supahbuzzer,shaddap
16-11-2017T22:55:16,Serpentfrog,"Surprise or something, Pepe."
16-11-2017T22:55:23,Ordithus,"... for once, I agree, Marv"
16-11-2017T22:55:24,SageSaga,you need to work on it
16-11-2017T22:55:39,ZRO4825,Better. Red bites Natani. Blames it on being around too many Keidran.
16-11-2017T22:55:44,Ordithus,lol
16-11-2017T22:55:46,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
16-11-2017T22:55:50,Serpentfrog,We sentence you to a manditory creative writing course.
16-11-2017T22:55:52,CrRAR,lol
16-11-2017T22:55:53,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Then keith Bites red
16-11-2017T22:55:57,Ordithus,Natani becomes a werehuman
16-11-2017T22:55:57,unsteddyphoenix,"Or maybe, no biting!"
16-11-2017T22:55:58,CrRAR,that's more like it
16-11-2017T22:56:00,SageSaga,throw in a thing about Natani dying and Keith being so depressed he kicks Flora in the stomach so hard they have to use magic to save the baby
16-11-2017T22:56:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,someone has to get bit Unsteddy
16-11-2017T22:56:18,Pepethecat,How tf have i not noticed that there is a stream on goddamn Fridays and Wednesdays

16-11-2017T22:56:40,Serpentfrog,"Careful, Sage. You'll attract Moppy."
16-11-2017T22:56:46,ZRO4825,"We have this giant situation involving multiple wolf people and a person who's sometimes a wolf person. Someone has to get bit, damnit!"

16-11-2017T22:57:19,FenceEqualizer,Holy crap Sage. I just get here and I see something super dark
16-11-2017T22:57:29,ZRO4825,It's kinda like Multipass.
16-11-2017T22:57:32,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Fence

16-11-2017T22:58:11,Pepethecat,Well idk about you but im on https://picarto.tv/Twokinds and I wanted to see Twokinds not the other 3 streams
16-11-2017T22:58:22,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-keifacepalm:
16-11-2017T22:58:27,ZRO4825,"You're going to see all 4 at once anyway right now, no matter which of them you're on."
16-11-2017T22:58:29,FenceEqualizer,Rude Pepe
16-11-2017T22:58:31,Bgrmystr2,but.. it's a multistream

16-11-2017T22:58:40,ZRO4825,"Unless you're on mobile, because the mobile app hasn't figured out multi-stream yet"
16-11-2017T22:58:42,Serpentfrog,You can maximize one.
16-11-2017T22:58:42,Bgrmystr2,:D
16-11-2017T22:58:44,MidnightBlue78,oh well...
16-11-2017T22:58:52,unsteddyphoenix,It's like he's trying to cover every bad stereotype in record time
16-11-2017T22:58:54,SageSaga,Tom joins me every week for Multistreaming on Fridays
16-11-2017T22:59:04,Pepethecat,Ah.

16-11-2017T22:59:16,Ordithus,Ron also joins 99/100 times
16-11-2017T22:59:18,CrRAR,be nice pepe
16-11-2017T22:59:20,GreatGreen,The mobile app hasn't figured out anything yet.
16-11-2017T22:59:26,ZRO4825,"Usually Nekonny too, but sometimes he takes a lazy day, damned cat."
16-11-2017T22:59:30,Bgrmystr2,most mobile apps seem to be trash
16-11-2017T22:59:34,Bgrmystr2,so that's not surprising
16-11-2017T22:59:43,ZRO4825,#4 is always random though. Sometimes it's Nero. Sometimes it's w0lfmare. o.o
16-11-2017T22:59:48,CrRAR,become good app dev
16-11-2017T22:59:50,Pepethecat,"Sorry, I've been really frustrated really."
16-11-2017T22:59:52,CrRAR,profit~
16-11-2017T23:00:13,Pepethecat,Today hasn't been cooperating with me :/
16-11-2017T23:00:15,Ordithus,Can you imagine 4 streams on a tiny little phone?
16-11-2017T23:00:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,yes
16-11-2017T23:00:26,Bgrmystr2,yeah
16-11-2017T23:00:32,Bgrmystr2,"easily, actually"
16-11-2017T23:00:36,Ordithus,It'd be like a stream for ants.
16-11-2017T23:00:41,Bgrmystr2,"Perhaps, yes."
16-11-2017T23:00:48,Bgrmystr2,but not difficult to imagine.
16-11-2017T23:00:52,CrRAR,Microfische
16-11-2017T23:01:01,CrRAR,practically
16-11-2017T23:01:07,SageSaga,that is why you hit the project button and put it on your wall
16-11-2017T23:01:07,MrAMP,Salutatons all
16-11-2017T23:01:11,ZRO4825,I can't. It's hard enough to get that app to play just ONE stream. :rofl:
16-11-2017T23:01:16,ZoieFalcona,*blinks curiously*
16-11-2017T23:01:19,Serpentfrog,"Hi, AMP."
16-11-2017T23:01:22,Ordithus,"that would be fancy, sage"
16-11-2017T23:01:25,Bgrmystr2,most phones have a big enough display to cover four streams though.
16-11-2017T23:01:26,Sammit,HI Amp
16-11-2017T23:01:29,Ordithus,I just use a TV
16-11-2017T23:02:10,CrRAR,good strateg-e
16-11-2017T23:02:29,FenceEqualizer,Like the iphone plus
16-11-2017T23:02:49,Bgrmystr2,"My phone has a 3 inch widescreen display, so it's not big by any means, and I can easily see myself watching four streams on a display that small."
16-11-2017T23:02:51,FenceEqualizer,Though with the size of it....it is no longer a phone but a small tablet to me.
16-11-2017T23:03:09,ZRO4825,ver smol tablet
16-11-2017T23:03:16,Bgrmystr2,"granted my phone wouldn't be able to, but pretty irrelevant honestly"
16-11-2017T23:03:53,furhead,Brb
16-11-2017T23:03:54,Ordithus,I suppose.
16-11-2017T23:04:04,Ordithus,"Of course, modern phones easily have the power to do it."
16-11-2017T23:04:07,Supahbuzzer,"what do you expect? raine's an outsider, gotta stay that way"
16-11-2017T23:04:46,Bgrmystr2,yeh mine's not designed for power. It's designed for survivability
16-11-2017T23:06:30,Crosseyedscribbles,i still wait for a compact smartphone that can reliably withstand being chucked across a parking lot
16-11-2017T23:06:40,MarshallMelon,"Well it's 4AM here. Better make a quiet exit. See you guy on Sunday, maybe."
