11-11-2017T15:18:18,Twokinds,I already defragged my memory since then.
11-11-2017T15:18:39,Twokinds,It was dumped to clear up space.
11-11-2017T15:18:41,Kinipshun,ouch theres a term i havent heard in a while
11-11-2017T15:19:02,MekalBoy,lel

11-11-2017T15:19:37,Kinipshun,like it was automatic or something

11-11-2017T15:20:54,Bgrmystr2,and yeah if you use SSD there's no reason to do Defrag
11-11-2017T15:20:58,Kinipshun,"what even IS defragmentation, exactly? i never looked into it"
11-11-2017T15:20:59,MekalBoy,"If you have non-SSDs, you gotta do it"
11-11-2017T15:21:06,MekalBoy,alright lemme link it
11-11-2017T15:21:10,Twokinds,My hard drive is from 1987
11-11-2017T15:21:10,Xexanoth,yeah but who has the money to buy large ssds

11-11-2017T15:21:38,Twokinds,Used to be top of the line but now it's prettyh old school.
11-11-2017T15:21:47,Xexanoth,How many MBs does your Hardrive have Tom? ^^
11-11-2017T15:22:07,MekalBoy,IMO you might want to get SSD only for OS and speedy-needy apps
11-11-2017T15:22:13,MekalBoy,And maybe gaming
11-11-2017T15:22:23,Bgrmystr2,"SSDs don't last too long, not compared to HDDs though"
11-11-2017T15:22:25,Bgrmystr2,unfortunate
11-11-2017T15:22:25,MekalBoy,But other than that a HDD should do the trick
11-11-2017T15:22:38,WereKeidran,i got an MSI a couple of weeks ago so that i can run my Oculus Rift
11-11-2017T15:22:41,Kinipshun,i still have a huge 16GB hdd layin around from the 90's

11-11-2017T15:23:42,Bgrmystr2,I actually have a 10gb drive sitting in my room from my dad's old computer shop
11-11-2017T15:23:53,MekalBoy,Happens
11-11-2017T15:23:56,Bgrmystr2,don't know where it is atm
11-11-2017T15:23:59,Bgrmystr2,but got one
11-11-2017T15:24:02,Bgrmystr2,still works too lol
11-11-2017T15:24:06,Bgrmystr2,xD
11-11-2017T15:24:08,Kinipshun,is it sATA?
11-11-2017T15:24:15,Kinipshun,or IDE
11-11-2017T15:24:20,Bgrmystr2,I don't actually recall
11-11-2017T15:24:49,Bgrmystr2,it's been probably about 7 or so years since I saw it
11-11-2017T15:25:10,Kinipshun,then you need to clean your room XD
11-11-2017T15:25:13,Bgrmystr2,"put it in a box, moved everything around about a hundred times since then"
11-11-2017T15:25:23,Bgrmystr2,bro that has happened a hundred times
11-11-2017T15:25:38,Bgrmystr2,just because the room is clean does not mean I remember where each and every little thing is hiding
11-11-2017T15:25:58,Bgrmystr2,That would take valuable space in my brain
11-11-2017T15:26:01,MekalBoy,"You, my friend, need a journal for organizing"
11-11-2017T15:26:03,Kinipshun,i was able to solve that issue with plastic drawers
11-11-2017T15:26:10,Kinipshun,lots of them
11-11-2017T15:26:14,Kinipshun,i mean LOTS
11-11-2017T15:26:15,Bgrmystr2,lack of space for that
11-11-2017T15:26:42,Xexanoth,just keep everything in a big pile on the floor
11-11-2017T15:26:44,Kinipshun,just download more space
11-11-2017T15:26:47,Xexanoth,problem solved
11-11-2017T15:26:51,MekalBoy,Actually sorting into different divisions is very nice
11-11-2017T15:27:07,Kinipshun,or just sorting in general
11-11-2017T15:27:07,MekalBoy,Like the work stuff could be divided in more work stuff
11-11-2017T15:27:30,Kinipshun,THAT sounds like it tkes up a lot of room
11-11-2017T15:27:37,MekalBoy,Work - 1-Art - Tools - Brushes
11-11-2017T15:27:38,Bgrmystr2,"I have six sets of plastic shelving, two desks, and two mobile computer carts all filled with boxes, mostly with computer shit."
11-11-2017T15:27:49,WereKeidran,stream starts in about 30 minutes right?
11-11-2017T15:27:50,Bgrmystr2,all in the same room
11-11-2017T15:28:02,Kinipshun,yeah about 30 mins
11-11-2017T15:28:20,WereKeidran,cool
11-11-2017T15:28:21,Kinipshun,just sell/scrap some of the stuff you know you wont use
11-11-2017T15:28:31,MekalBoy,That is a nice idea
11-11-2017T15:28:43,MekalBoy,Just don't sell the stuff that you *might* use
11-11-2017T15:29:17,MekalBoy,"idk about you, but I would much rather have more stuff than I need than having less stuff than I need"
11-11-2017T15:29:23,Kinipshun,"you can get a lot of money from scrap collectors, plus, if you desolder all the resistors and ICs you might use, youll always have THOSE if you need em"
11-11-2017T15:29:38,Bgrmystr2,"unfortunately for me, I have used at least everything I have. :P"
11-11-2017T15:29:46,MekalBoy,Old computer components are really nice to not sell
11-11-2017T15:29:55,MekalBoy,"I mean, if they still work you might find a use for them"
11-11-2017T15:29:58,Bgrmystr2,"story of my life, Mekel"
11-11-2017T15:29:59,MekalBoy,Make a server or something
11-11-2017T15:30:07,Bgrmystr2,lolol make a server
11-11-2017T15:30:09,Kinipshun,i want to make a server really bad
11-11-2017T15:30:10,MekalBoy,"""mekel"" *triggered*"
11-11-2017T15:30:16,Bgrmystr2,good

11-11-2017T15:30:19,Bgrmystr2,&gt;;v
11-11-2017T15:30:19,Kinipshun,has anyone here ever made a server
11-11-2017T15:30:30,Kinipshun,?
11-11-2017T15:30:35,MekalBoy,"Besides me, idk"
11-11-2017T15:30:41,Kinipshun,did you?
11-11-2017T15:30:46,MekalBoy,of course
11-11-2017T15:30:55,Bgrmystr2,"helped my dad build a server back in the 90s, don't have one myself though."
11-11-2017T15:30:57,Kinipshun,"what does it entail, and is it easy?"
11-11-2017T15:31:11,Bgrmystr2,so a lot has changed since then
11-11-2017T15:31:13,MekalBoy,"Well, I do it basic, so can't really say for sure"
11-11-2017T15:31:21,MekalBoy,I just recycle old PC components
11-11-2017T15:31:26,Kinipshun,i know you can use a micro-ITX for it
11-11-2017T15:31:30,Kinipshun,and thats all i know
11-11-2017T15:31:37,Bgrmystr2,xDD
11-11-2017T15:31:56,Kinipshun,"oh, and you need a power cable"
11-11-2017T15:32:03,Bgrmystr2,really
11-11-2017T15:32:08,MekalBoy,I basically make PCs that I use as servers or use them for a network
11-11-2017T15:32:11,Bgrmystr2,I thought it was just.. yknow.. wireless power :V
11-11-2017T15:32:30,MekalBoy,I find it surprisingly easy to hack in wherever I want in my neighbourhood
11-11-2017T15:32:52,Bgrmystr2,"but for what purpose, exactly"
11-11-2017T15:33:04,Kinipshun,"i want to stuff a second motherboard in my computer case (it'll fit if i get creative), then have it run alongside off the same PSU"
11-11-2017T15:33:09,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, you aren't gonna just make money by building servers for your house lol"
11-11-2017T15:33:14,MekalBoy,"Although I only ever tried actual hacks at a friend's house, with his consent"
11-11-2017T15:33:31,MekalBoy,Servers... I usually use them for mailing stuff
11-11-2017T15:33:46,Bgrmystr2,"most psus only have one power cuplink, Kinip"
11-11-2017T15:33:48,MekalBoy,Actually I have a long list with uses for the servers
11-11-2017T15:34:06,Kinipshun,oh yeah thats ttru
11-11-2017T15:34:35,MekalBoy,"Power is a nightmare, but as long as I don't do anything on the servers they automatically go to sleep"
11-11-2017T15:35:00,MekalBoy,Which I can override from the main control pannel
11-11-2017T15:35:14,MekalBoy,I am telling you they are really nice for video editing and rendering
11-11-2017T15:36:01,Kinipshun,"keeping the video files on the server and editing them from another computer, you mean?"
11-11-2017T15:36:42,MekalBoy,"Yes, or making commands/instructions that I then send to the servers"
11-11-2017T15:36:47,MekalBoy,so they can do stuff
11-11-2017T15:37:03,MekalBoy,Easy stuff once you get the hang of it
11-11-2017T15:37:15,MekalBoy,Or once you ~automate everything
11-11-2017T15:37:33,Kinipshun,"i never learned coding, and i know very little command line. how long does it take to learn?"
11-11-2017T15:38:00,Thatshyguy,Hey everyone!
11-11-2017T15:38:03,MekalBoy,hey

11-11-2017T15:38:11,Kinipshun,yoy
11-11-2017T15:38:16,MekalBoy,"Well, Kinip, it depends on the language and your determination"
11-11-2017T15:38:24,MekalBoy,"Also, usually you don't only learn one"
11-11-2017T15:39:02,MekalBoy,Although usually the basic stuff remains the same while only the syntax changes
11-11-2017T15:39:06,Thatshyguy,stream delayed?
11-11-2017T15:39:34,BadFoMo,@Thatshyguy Starts a 4:00 PM EST.
11-11-2017T15:39:41,MekalBoy,Doesn't it start at 4:00? It's like 3:40 rn
11-11-2017T15:40:40,Thatshyguy,ahh okay
11-11-2017T15:41:15,Thatshyguy,strange though it ususally has started by this time for me
11-11-2017T15:41:58,MekalBoy,"Just realised I didn't specify the time to learn. Depending on the syntax, you can get the hang of it in as little as 3 hours or so."
11-11-2017T15:42:19,Xexanoth,@Thatshyguy it starts at different time

11-11-2017T15:47:33,WereKeidran,hey Terra
11-11-2017T15:47:39,BadFoMo,Hi.
11-11-2017T15:47:41,Thatshyguy,hey terra
11-11-2017T15:47:43,Bgrmystr2,xD it's not even something you need to inspect element for though.. it's just.. normal internet proceedings
11-11-2017T15:48:12,MekalBoy,"Nevermind, they are synced"
11-11-2017T15:48:41,MekalBoy,"Neon sent a different one, judging by the ID"
11-11-2017T15:48:51,MekalBoy,That is why it doesn't move like the other two
11-11-2017T15:49:00,Bgrmystr2,"mine sometimes are, sometimes are not synced"
11-11-2017T15:49:08,MekalBoy,"It is not synced, for it is not the same"
11-11-2017T15:49:19,Bgrmystr2,That's actually irrelevant
11-11-2017T15:49:37,MekalBoy,How do I know
11-11-2017T15:49:40,Bgrmystr2,"Neon's not subscribed to tom, but saved the icon so now he has it cuz it's basic"
11-11-2017T15:50:11,MekalBoy,"Yes but, as you said, they run based on the download time"
11-11-2017T15:50:20,Bgrmystr2,"the sync is not based on what icon it is or who sends it, it's based on when your pc gets it. if you refresh the chat a bunch of times, eventually neon's nibbly icon will sync with the others"
11-11-2017T15:50:33,Bgrmystr2,because it was able to load them from the cache
11-11-2017T15:51:14,MekalBoy,Yes but you see
11-11-2017T15:51:25,MekalBoy,It caches based on ID
11-11-2017T15:51:30,Bgrmystr2,"it doesn't always work, and usually chat goes fast enough where multiple icons don't stay on the bottom. but that's the jist of it"
11-11-2017T15:51:41,MekalBoy,Just because it looks the same it doesn't mean it is the same
11-11-2017T15:51:49,MekalBoy,Different ID means different cache
11-11-2017T15:51:59,MekalBoy,"So it just loads the other ID, even if it is the same gif"
11-11-2017T15:52:04,Bgrmystr2,you don't seem to understand the icons then. The icons are easily saved and uploaded
11-11-2017T15:52:07,MekalBoy,I just checked on the phone
11-11-2017T15:52:44,Bgrmystr2,"it's the exact same gif, just saved and uploaded from a different user's icon list :P"
11-11-2017T15:52:47,MekalBoy,This is not something worth arguing over.
11-11-2017T15:52:56,MekalBoy,Let it be your way :p
11-11-2017T15:53:00,Bgrmystr2,it ain't an argument. I've been here for over a year bro
11-11-2017T15:53:03,NeonMitsumi,Why are you arguing over my Nibs god dammit
11-11-2017T15:53:23,Bgrmystr2,I've already synced different icons from different people. It's happened.
11-11-2017T15:53:39,Bgrmystr2,because it's worth it neon
11-11-2017T15:53:41,Bgrmystr2,:v
11-11-2017T15:53:50,MekalBoy,"src=""/user_data/usrimg/neonmitsumi/emoticons/49200.gif"" &lt;- this is Neon"
11-11-2017T15:53:51,MekalBoy,'s
11-11-2017T15:53:56,NeonMitsumi,Give me a second to make it fully out of sync.
11-11-2017T15:53:57,Xexanoth,just don't have shit internet that take forever to load shit *problem solved*
11-11-2017T15:54:10,NeonMitsumi,I do
11-11-2017T15:54:16,NeonMitsumi,lol
11-11-2017T15:54:20,MekalBoy,"src=""/user_data/usrimg/twokinds/emoticons/31481.gif"" &lt;- This is the normal subbed one"
11-11-2017T15:54:46,Bgrmystr2,"it wouldn't make a diff though Xexanoth, cuz you can't control the speed of every single node between your picarto client and the picarto host"
11-11-2017T15:55:03,Bgrmystr2,so there's no way for you to guarantee the icons will be synced or unsynced
11-11-2017T15:55:16,MekalBoy,It shall be coincidence
11-11-2017T15:55:19,MekalBoy,Let it be like that

11-11-2017T16:29:13,Serpentfrog,"It may be a proper word, but that wasn't a proper use."
11-11-2017T16:29:15,Kamaro12,"was gonna say, haven't we already seen this?"

11-11-2017T16:31:18,Bgrmystr2,so it was more than likely going to be a pick of his own if it didn't win the poll

11-11-2017T16:45:38,ThingsAreMoving,you need to work on your focus

11-11-2017T16:50:54,Xexanoth,he did get taller though
11-11-2017T16:50:58,MarvTheHugPharaoh,and cuter
11-11-2017T16:50:59,ChromeDragon24,a bit
11-11-2017T16:51:02,ValSalianResident,"Wow, you're right"
11-11-2017T16:51:05,Danodan94,Quite a bit taller.

11-11-2017T16:51:14,DarthKeidran,Meant to whisper that.
11-11-2017T16:51:20,Xexanoth,"nah, he changed cuteness for sexiness, might be just his current expression though"
11-11-2017T16:51:22,Ordithus,"Natani had to sit down, or the swoonage would knock him off his feet."

11-11-2017T16:52:30,WereKeidran,Natani looks to have inherited the katana tail
11-11-2017T16:52:34,habilonionart,is that a sword nat or are you excited?
11-11-2017T16:52:34,ValSalianResident,That's more like a TailUltraGreatsword

11-11-2017T17:10:55,BoxStealthFox,Phantom thief Keith was in the previous round
11-11-2017T17:10:56,DarthKeidran,The question is what tom's pick is.
11-11-2017T17:11:00,ValSalianResident,Lokks like a basitin or Mike
11-11-2017T17:11:05,Kamaro12,"jesus, I hope we don't go back to them being all votes"

11-11-2017T17:11:12,Combak,So... Is Tom doing his pick now or just predicting?
11-11-2017T17:11:14,Wooffin,Btw does Raines keidran form effect her apetite? Like food preferences and such?
11-11-2017T17:11:16,Xexanoth,'s drawing the tom pick of the first vote round
11-11-2017T17:11:20,ThingsAreMoving,symmetry in all things!

11-11-2017T17:11:22,PalmettoPathfinder1,I thought it was the one about Keidran rituals that got second place?

11-11-2017T17:13:25,MysteryEzekude,I don't give a damn about Zen.
11-11-2017T17:13:27,Kamaro12,"okay, what exactly is the point of the poll if he's immediately going to start drawing one anyways?"
11-11-2017T17:13:28,BadFoMo,@w0lfmare //Troll With the Blueberry Inflation?!
11-11-2017T17:13:29,MarvTheHugPharaoh,both cute and adorable

11-11-2017T17:14:13,Ordithus,"same, xexa"
11-11-2017T17:14:15,Kamaro12,unsteddy: so he has to do both at the same time? That just gets unecessarily confusing
11-11-2017T17:14:17,NeonMitsumi,Dis gon be gud
11-11-2017T17:14:20,Bgrmystr2,good

11-11-2017T17:14:24,Zakuru,oh so i missed a vote ;w;
11-11-2017T17:14:24,Wooffin,And wonder if Raine giggles or blushes eiyj sekestf look on her face. If the scene would happen Marv
11-11-2017T17:14:34,Serpentfrog,rubs his flippers together.
11-11-2017T17:14:37,PalmettoPathfinder1,I'm surprised that no one likes Iris and her friend.  :(
11-11-2017T17:14:42,Combak,... Flippers?
11-11-2017T17:14:43,MidnightBlue78,"Ooh, my jam is on"
11-11-2017T17:14:43,JimBat,Love me a good 4th wall break
11-11-2017T17:14:44,unsteddyphoenix,"Maybe you shouldnt be taking it so seriously, then you wouldnt be so confused"
11-11-2017T17:14:45,BoxStealthFox,"Welp, it was nice talking to ya chaalsfsfjaofafca"
11-11-2017T17:14:46,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"@thestooge mine was 2nd place, I smell a winner in the future"
11-11-2017T17:14:48,ThingsAreMoving,who's Iris ?
11-11-2017T17:14:51,WereKeidran,i voted for the Iris one
11-11-2017T17:14:57,Ordithus,Iris is the sexy tiger lady
11-11-2017T17:14:57,Dadrobit,This is SRS BSNS Princess!!!
11-11-2017T17:14:58,NeonMitsumi,Iris is a hoe
11-11-2017T17:14:58,ProsePro7,Alright everybody lets start writing so good stuff for Natani to be disgusted with.
11-11-2017T17:15:00,KiTA,Oh wow there was another vote haha
11-11-2017T17:15:02,MysteryEzekude,"Anyway, I was away during the first hour due to my faulty connection."
11-11-2017T17:15:02,Wyvern088,welp.... better late than never... what did I miss?
11-11-2017T17:15:02,Serpentfrog,"I'm part frog. get with the program, Combak."
11-11-2017T17:15:09,WereKeidran,The tigress that was mean to Flora
11-11-2017T17:15:09,w0lfmare,Who's Iris? :cw0lfmare-SilSly:
11-11-2017T17:15:11,Kamaro12,unsteddy: why wouldn't i be if I'm putting money towards this?
11-11-2017T17:15:12,PalmettoPathfinder1,Nat and Adelaide would make a hot couple!
11-11-2017T17:15:14,MysteryEzekude,So we had Fem!Keith...Anything before that?
11-11-2017T17:15:16,Sammit,HI Wyvern
11-11-2017T17:15:23,BadFoMo,"Ok, I voted for the triplets; who is the other voter?"
11-11-2017T17:15:28,DarthKeidran,Look's like tom's pick is Brahn's daughter. What's her name? And I am absolutely astonished that the Natani looking at the chat disgusted won out.
11-11-2017T17:15:29,ThingsAreMoving,this is the second sketch
11-11-2017T17:15:30,WereKeidran,nope that was the first sketch
11-11-2017T17:15:39,NeonMitsumi,@BadFoMo That'd be me.
11-11-2017T17:15:39,Combak,... I wouldn't call those flippers @SerpentFrog.
11-11-2017T17:15:47,ThingsAreMoving,flip flops ?
11-11-2017T17:15:48,Dadrobit,"Kam, don't think of it as an investment, it's a donation."
11-11-2017T17:15:53,Ordithus,I don't think she's been given a name yet
11-11-2017T17:15:55,Dadrobit,makes it easier
11-11-2017T17:15:56,PalmettoPathfinder1,Iris is a tigress who while sexy looks down on tamed Keidran (like Flora) and thinks wild Keidran are superior to both humans and domesticated Keidran.
11-11-2017T17:16:01,Serpentfrog,What would you call them?
11-11-2017T17:16:05,MekalBoy,Well this should be enough for today
11-11-2017T17:16:08,unsteddyphoenix,what dad said
11-11-2017T17:16:11,MarvTheHugPharaoh,worthy investment
11-11-2017T17:16:13,MekalBoy,Have a great stream everyone
11-11-2017T17:16:14,Kamaro12,"I'm not demanding anything from him, I'm just saying it's kind of confusing when he starts drawing as soon as a poll is up"
11-11-2017T17:16:20,MekalBoy,Cya l8r
11-11-2017T17:16:21,NeonMitsumi,Seeya Mekal
11-11-2017T17:16:24,Kamaro12,I like it when he lets the vote happens and then picks one after
11-11-2017T17:16:25,ProsePro7,We see so little of her.  I want to see more of the seer's daughter.  Does she have a name?
11-11-2017T17:16:26,PalmettoPathfinder1,I agree with Kamaro12 too.
11-11-2017T17:16:29,WereKeidran,l8r Mekal
11-11-2017T17:16:29,MysteryEzekude,Was there anything before the Fem!Keith sketch?
11-11-2017T17:16:34,Combak,Paws? Hands? Paddles? Flippers makes me think of dolphins.
11-11-2017T17:16:34,ZahnHolley,Bye mekal
11-11-2017T17:16:40,WereKeidran,no Mystery
11-11-2017T17:16:42,FoxxTrotter,"C-ya, Mekal."
11-11-2017T17:16:43,Combak,Nope Ezekude!
11-11-2017T17:16:44,PalmettoPathfinder1,Bye mekal.
11-11-2017T17:16:48,MysteryEzekude,Okay. Thank you.
11-11-2017T17:16:49,Combak,Bye Mekal!
11-11-2017T17:16:50,ThingsAreMoving,paddles on a frog
11-11-2017T17:16:54,unsteddyphoenix,"An old, wise philosopher once said:"
11-11-2017T17:16:57,Sammit,Bye Mekal

11-11-2017T17:17:00,Bgrmystr2,"I don't see what the problem is. If he draws something, and it wins, then people claim ""PREDICTION!@"". If it doesn't win, then it's something he would have picked anyway."
11-11-2017T17:17:00,ThingsAreMoving,perfect for bitchslapping people
11-11-2017T17:17:01,unsteddyphoenix,"""Fuck you I wont do what you tell me"
11-11-2017T17:17:02,DarthKeidran,Be back in a few. It's been a while since we've seen Brahn's daughter. I'm curious to see how this turns out.
11-11-2017T17:17:03,Dadrobit,"I like this style, it saves time between sketches."
11-11-2017T17:17:07,CrRAR,haha
11-11-2017T17:17:08,unsteddyphoenix,I think we can all learn a lot by that.
11-11-2017T17:17:11,Kamaro12,bgr: that's the problem though
11-11-2017T17:17:13,MysteryEzekude,That's what EVERYONE says!
11-11-2017T17:17:15,unsteddyphoenix,*from
11-11-2017T17:17:36,Kamaro12,"unless he's recylcing some of the ballots back into the next vote, that's even less opportunity for the people who put in those suggestions to get their drawn"
11-11-2017T17:17:39,BadFoMo,I probably should have asked who the other two voters for Kat & Eric as Nagas were at the time.
11-11-2017T17:17:42,TorqueEmUp,I am personally fine with it this way
11-11-2017T17:17:42,Kamaro12,because then we just skip to the next vote
11-11-2017T17:17:48,Kamaro12,assuming that's how he's doing it anyways
11-11-2017T17:17:58,NeonMitsumi,@BadFoMo That wouldn't be me!
11-11-2017T17:18:07,BadFoMo,Dang.
11-11-2017T17:18:13,unsteddyphoenix,"Well lets be honest, were you particularly interested in any from the first poll&gt;"
11-11-2017T17:18:18,unsteddyphoenix,I wasnt.
11-11-2017T17:18:20,ThingsAreMoving,I was!
11-11-2017T17:18:23,Kamaro12,that doesn't matter
11-11-2017T17:18:25,ThingsAreMoving,Ceiling Kat ftw
11-11-2017T17:18:25,NeonMitsumi,First one? Not too much.
11-11-2017T17:18:27,w0lfmare,This one he's drawing is a Tom pick. He probably did the next vote early so there was more time to think up a good idea
11-11-2017T17:18:29,Kamaro12,I wan't eveyone to get an equal chance
11-11-2017T17:18:33,PalmettoPathfinder1,I think Nat's reaction to the chat would be like this: https://kitfox-crimson.deviantart.com/art/Pipa-FanArt-681090760
11-11-2017T17:18:38,NeonMitsumi,"Ceiling Kat, yes."
11-11-2017T17:18:43,Kamaro12,even if it means the ones I dont' like get picked a lot
11-11-2017T17:18:44,WereKeidran,I'm excitedly waiting for my sketch topop up on the polls
11-11-2017T17:18:48,Kamaro12,at least it's equal opportunity
11-11-2017T17:18:50,unsteddyphoenix,Even if it means Tom has to draw something he doesnt really want to?
11-11-2017T17:18:52,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Sorry for the link, but couldn't figure out how to describe it."
11-11-2017T17:18:57,w0lfmare,Also hey! I liked the first poll :cw0lfmare-EmberSad:
11-11-2017T17:19:03,Kamaro12,"well if he didn't want to draw it, he shouldn't put it on the poll"
11-11-2017T17:19:03,MarvTheHugPharaoh,me too
11-11-2017T17:19:05,unsteddyphoenix,Whats the point of him picking if he has to pick something he doesnt like
11-11-2017T17:19:10,Combak,"Same, lots of options I liked."
11-11-2017T17:19:14,unsteddyphoenix,For the sake of abiding to the rules HE made
11-11-2017T17:19:17,Bgrmystr2,It's still equal opportunity either way. He's going to draw what was voted for next
11-11-2017T17:19:19,ValSalianResident,https://imgur.com/wUYvulq Kinda related
11-11-2017T17:19:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,first poll was a fun one
11-11-2017T17:19:23,Kamaro12,unstedy: because it's fair?
11-11-2017T17:19:35,NeonMitsumi,My favorite poll was the third one.
11-11-2017T17:19:42,Bgrmystr2,xDD Neon
11-11-2017T17:19:59,Thatshyguy,"btw the Top Web Comics Voting Incentive button on the main site is yet to have changed to the new incentive (Raine tail movment), it still shows Floras hair thingies"
11-11-2017T17:20:00,Kamaro12,"there's like twenty options each round, I doubt he wouldn't be able to find one he can deal with"
11-11-2017T17:20:01,w0lfmare,Apparently we have TWO seers here?
11-11-2017T17:20:02,Ordithus,This is looking good so far.
11-11-2017T17:20:16,DarthKeidran,"She's turning out beautifully. Question is, is this meant to be a few years later because that looks like a pretty styling prom dress."
11-11-2017T17:20:26,Bgrmystr2,Tom doesn't have to pick a vote in the polls to draw. He can pick whatever suggestion he wants from the entire list.
11-11-2017T17:20:28,ZahnHolley,My words speaks volume.
11-11-2017T17:20:32,Combak,"Yes, Master Seer Brann and his daughter."
11-11-2017T17:20:32,Bgrmystr2,We only get to pick from the vote.
11-11-2017T17:20:45,Serpentfrog,We aren't worthy.
11-11-2017T17:20:46,unsteddyphoenix,"7 sketches will get picked from 7 people, thats perfectly fair"
11-11-2017T17:20:47,TorqueEmUp,Indeed

11-11-2017T17:22:05,Kamaro12,Combak: not sure what you mean by that. I loved it when tom changed it so he was picking every other one
11-11-2017T17:22:05,Bgrmystr2,The one we voted for will come after this.
11-11-2017T17:22:07,Dadrobit,"Aye, I can't say this changes anything."

11-11-2017T17:23:41,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Well, I wonder if people would vote for my suggestion of Keith waking up and freaking out that he slept with Nat and Adelaide!"

11-11-2017T17:31:45,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Well, I think Natani cosplaying as a Starcraft Terran Ghost would be cool."

11-11-2017T20:20:06,unsteddyphoenix,I think maybe it was just too much work?
11-11-2017T20:20:07,ProsePro7,Just remember ceiling Tom watches us chat
11-11-2017T20:20:11,unsteddyphoenix,Drawing dragons is hard mang
11-11-2017T20:20:11,FenceEqualizer,Don't mind that. Wasn't sure who he was answering.

11-11-2017T20:21:00,FenceEqualizer,lol
11-11-2017T20:21:22,BadFoMo,@Bgrmystr2 I'd vote for it.

11-11-2017T20:21:35,CrimsonHelsing,"Well who suggested that idea that got 2nd place in the final poll? Do it again next time, it's a good one! Like, legit! IF Tom doesn't pick it off screen that is ;P"

11-11-2017T20:21:52,MarshallMelon,"Things there's a cooldown of a month, minimum"
11-11-2017T20:22:04,ThingsAreMoving,sure it's a month?
11-11-2017T20:22:05,w0lfmare,"Clovis, but with more money, power, and full wolf"
11-11-2017T20:22:06,MarshallMelon,Yeah
11-11-2017T20:22:10,Menke,"My experience is that it's two weeks, not counting coloring weeks"
11-11-2017T20:22:13,MarshallMelon,That's how it's been since last year
11-11-2017T20:22:17,Xexanoth,it used to be a week
11-11-2017T20:22:19,Dadrobit,Yep. Done that wait a few times :D
11-11-2017T20:22:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"the seer's daughter and the last Flora one, are my fav's from this stream"

11-11-2017T20:22:23,ThingsAreMoving,see I remember it being a week
11-11-2017T20:22:37,ThingsAreMoving,not long ago (two or three months)
11-11-2017T20:22:39,MarshallMelon,"It might've changed, but i've definitely seen it being a month"
11-11-2017T20:22:41,FenceEqualizer,Felt it was longer then a week.
11-11-2017T20:22:53,MidnightBlue78,@Ordithus great suggestion
11-11-2017T20:23:08,Menke,"Like I said, the coloring weeks don't count.  So if you win the last week of a month, you have to wait longer, in my experience"
11-11-2017T20:23:08,unsteddyphoenix,Agreed
11-11-2017T20:23:09,Ordithus,Thanks.
11-11-2017T20:23:10,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Well, I just have to wait until next month until I can get a new pic done.  :)"

11-11-2017T20:24:03,MarshallMelon,It won't be considered until the cooldown period is over
11-11-2017T20:24:07,FenceEqualizer,Yeah.
11-11-2017T20:24:23,FenceEqualizer,Just keep putting it in. When you see it then you're good to go
11-11-2017T20:24:26,ThingsAreMoving,yup
11-11-2017T20:24:31,PalmettoPathfinder1,Cool.  Thank you Fence!
11-11-2017T20:24:48,CrimsonHelsing,what were you talking about?
11-11-2017T20:24:59,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah it used to be a week but I think it's changed to a month
11-11-2017T20:25:08,Ordithus,"Great timing, my roast squash is ready!"
11-11-2017T20:25:14,FenceEqualizer,Which is fair.
11-11-2017T20:25:15,Dadrobit,"It was a week, but that was a pretty long time ago"
11-11-2017T20:25:18,CrimsonHelsing,No answer? o.o
11-11-2017T20:25:24,w0lfmare,What's the suggestion?
11-11-2017T20:25:26,CrimsonHelsing,I'm confussed
11-11-2017T20:25:35,Dadrobit,Flora's ultrasound
11-11-2017T20:25:43,Dadrobit,Which is literally a spoiler
11-11-2017T20:25:52,MarshallMelon,Crimson we're talking about the cooldown between getting a sketch drawn and being able to suggest again
11-11-2017T20:25:54,FenceEqualizer,Talking about how long you have to wait when you win a vote.
11-11-2017T20:25:54,unsteddyphoenix,Lmao
11-11-2017T20:26:03,FenceEqualizer,It's safe from being a spoiler.
11-11-2017T20:26:12,CrimsonHelsing,I dunno if it's a spoiler it wouldn't make the poll Dad
11-11-2017T20:26:18,FenceEqualizer,Just don't show the answer.
11-11-2017T20:26:19,Serpentfrog,As opposed to figurative spoilers?
11-11-2017T20:26:19,unsteddyphoenix,The ultrasound? No that's def a spoiler.
11-11-2017T20:26:24,unsteddyphoenix,Cmon
11-11-2017T20:26:26,thestooge,So is Tom done?
11-11-2017T20:26:28,w0lfmare,"Don't think there is a wait, was one ever mentioned?"
11-11-2017T20:26:31,MarshallMelon,"We don't necessarily see the result, phoenix"
11-11-2017T20:26:38,CrimsonHelsing,"Tom said himself, if it's spoilers it doesn't make it"
11-11-2017T20:26:50,FenceEqualizer,We know she's expected...we don't know anything after that Phoenix.
11-11-2017T20:26:56,Twokinds,I somehow don't see them having an ultrasound in the comic
11-11-2017T20:27:11,Ordithus,"Magic(k)al Ultrasound, or Whatever"
11-11-2017T20:27:18,unsteddyphoenix,"So it's the equivalent of ""Trace and Flora find out the babies gender"" and it's just them reacting?"
11-11-2017T20:27:32,CrimsonHelsing,"The ultrasound made it, so it's clearly not spoilers, not like he'll let us see what's on the screen anyway"
11-11-2017T20:27:32,BluePhantom90,What you mean Tom?
11-11-2017T20:27:33,FenceEqualizer,Pretty much. At least how I saw it.
11-11-2017T20:27:35,unsteddyphoenix,"""Wow! Im so happy that the baby is XXXXXXXX! Ive always wanted a little XXXXX"""
11-11-2017T20:27:47,FenceEqualizer,Also...MAGIC!

11-11-2017T20:28:01,BluePhantom90,Well you can have the Screen not pointed at the view point of us the readers or watchers
11-11-2017T20:28:04,unsteddyphoenix,Seems pretty good im in.
11-11-2017T20:28:07,w0lfmare,"Wow, I am happy with the gender that is a this"
11-11-2017T20:28:10,FenceEqualizer,Scrying or something.
11-11-2017T20:28:16,CrimsonHelsing,Exactly Blue

11-11-2017T20:28:57,BluePhantom90,As long as we don't see the baby. But Ultrasounds is difficult to understand or see anyways
11-11-2017T20:29:08,MidnightBlue78,having Trace reacting all surprised but without showing it
11-11-2017T20:29:23,MidnightBlue78,i like that idea
11-11-2017T20:29:37,Dadrobit,"Reminds me of an old comic where the mother asked for the nurse to drop a subtle hint on the baby's gender because the father didn't want to know. So the nurse started belting out ""The boys are back in town!"""
11-11-2017T20:29:38,unsteddyphoenix,I feel like the people who would vote on it would expect it to reveal the gender though
11-11-2017T20:29:42,Ordithus,Maybe... maybe Kat was right.  Flora's just a tubby tiger.
11-11-2017T20:29:44,unsteddyphoenix,It's kinda bait-y
11-11-2017T20:30:01,unsteddyphoenix,Could be subtler lol
11-11-2017T20:30:03,MidnightBlue78,"hmmmm, maybe"
11-11-2017T20:30:10,CrimsonHelsing,Like the song the Bus Boys sang?
11-11-2017T20:30:12,FenceEqualizer,"I suppose. I didn't see it like that, but I can understand why others would."
11-11-2017T20:30:14,Ordithus,"Anyways, din din time.  Bye!"

11-11-2017T20:31:24,Twokinds,I'd just make it a joke
11-11-2017T20:31:32,MarshallMelon,The only logical answer
11-11-2017T20:31:38,BluePhantom90,The Doctor would be the one to know if its a boy or Girls since they do it like a million tims a year

11-11-2017T20:42:51,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno, I just go into the link on the site and vote for TK when I see there's a new incentive"
11-11-2017T20:43:19,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah, I dont think Tom really cares so"
11-11-2017T20:43:20,MidnightBlue78,i've always wondered what its for
11-11-2017T20:43:23,w0lfmare,It's super useful for getting your comic some traffic
11-11-2017T20:43:37,unsteddyphoenix,I mean that IS how I found Twokinds personally
11-11-2017T20:43:43,MarshallMelon,"Yeah, I imagine it's a lot more important for new comics versus established ones"
11-11-2017T20:43:46,MidnightBlue78,"oh, so to like advertise it?"
11-11-2017T20:43:59,unsteddyphoenix,Basically yeah
11-11-2017T20:44:00,MarshallMelon,But the established ones get more presence due to their fanbases
11-11-2017T20:44:03,MidnightBlue78,cool
11-11-2017T20:44:07,MarshallMelon,Good ol' Catch-22
11-11-2017T20:44:07,Dadrobit,"It's not the most important thing in the world for Tom pre se, but it acts like an information hub to new readers for what might be an interesting comic to check out"
11-11-2017T20:44:18,Dadrobit,per se*
11-11-2017T20:46:04,Dadrobit,"Which reminds me, gotta go give Bloodline a vote."
11-11-2017T20:46:12,w0lfmare,:cw0lfmare-AriahHappy:
11-11-2017T20:46:17,unsteddyphoenix,"Oh, i'll do it"
11-11-2017T20:46:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Gotta vote
11-11-2017T20:46:34,w0lfmare,I gotta get back on track with my incentives
11-11-2017T20:46:38,MarshallMelon,I too will deliver the internet points
11-11-2017T20:46:47,w0lfmare,I used to put up new ones every week
11-11-2017T20:47:09,Serpentfrog,Is that maintainable?
11-11-2017T20:47:30,thestooge,good night guys
11-11-2017T20:47:35,Dadrobit,o/ stooge
11-11-2017T20:47:38,MarshallMelon,"Toodles, stooge"
11-11-2017T20:47:40,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nigthy night Stooge
11-11-2017T20:47:43,w0lfmare,Maintainable?
11-11-2017T20:47:56,MarshallMelon,Can you do it consistently over a long period of time?
11-11-2017T20:48:03,Serpentfrog,^
11-11-2017T20:48:23,w0lfmare,"Add incentives you mean? Yeah, as long as I keep drawing"
11-11-2017T20:48:46,MarshallMelon,Just be careful not to burn out
11-11-2017T20:49:18,Dadrobit,"Well, they don't have to be full color glossies like Tom"
11-11-2017T20:49:46,w0lfmare,"Yeah, I usually just throw up a sketch there before I post it on Deviantart"
11-11-2017T20:49:49,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah it can just be a sketch or something
11-11-2017T20:50:08,Dadrobit,"Lot of folks do different ""Here's my art progress"" variants"
11-11-2017T20:50:22,unsteddyphoenix,Do you post it on DA after youve taken it off the incentive?
11-11-2017T20:50:34,w0lfmare,Usually
11-11-2017T20:50:49,unsteddyphoenix,Makes sense
11-11-2017T20:51:33,w0lfmare,"Sometimes the incentives wind up on my Patreon, and the people who keep up with the voting get to see it for free as a thanks"
11-11-2017T20:52:07,Dadrobit,":( Wish I made more dosh man, or I'd definitely throw you a bone"
11-11-2017T20:52:08,unsteddyphoenix,"Aha, smart."
11-11-2017T20:52:45,w0lfmare,"Though, I guess that's rarely planned. Usually I try to keep regular content flowing to both Deviantart and Patreon, and I don't always know where the sketches are going to end up"
11-11-2017T20:53:12,w0lfmare,No worries Robit
11-11-2017T20:54:02,unsteddyphoenix,I'd rather see a sketch a week than a really detailed colour pic every few months or so
11-11-2017T20:54:37,w0lfmare,Agreed
11-11-2017T20:54:46,w0lfmare,Though a variety of the two is nice
11-11-2017T20:55:01,unsteddyphoenix,Thats true~
11-11-2017T20:55:23,unsteddyphoenix,"Maybe you should do 3 weeks of sketches, then at the end of the month do some colours and..."
11-11-2017T20:56:40,FenceEqualizer,Don't think it needs to be so heavily scheduled. Just throwing a color every now and then is awesome.
11-11-2017T20:57:03,MarshallMelon,I think he was doing the sarcasms
11-11-2017T20:58:06,unsteddyphoenix,(its funny 'cause thats what Tom does)
11-11-2017T20:58:08,FenceEqualizer,Doh.
11-11-2017T20:58:22,Serpentfrog,Now I want to write something similar to Phantom Toll Booth with a chasm of sar.
11-11-2017T21:06:05,MarshallMelon,"Welp, looks like everything's dropped off. See you next time, everyone."
11-11-2017T21:06:12,Dadrobit,o/ Marshall
