29-12-2017T00:44:24,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: So the question is.. do I pronounce it wrong on purpose because fuckit? Or do I pronounce it wrong just to tease?

29-12-2017T00:45:59,ZRO4825,"Back when I created the name (back in the dark days of arcade games and archaic highscore systems), I was only allowed a total of THREE spaces for a name on the listings. As I was using the name Zero at the time, something had to go. :P"
29-12-2017T00:46:02,Bgrmystr2,"Yeah, Sage can make fun of names, but I can't. Some people are just above the law. :P"
29-12-2017T00:46:16,ZRO4825,"Tis a good question, Sage."
29-12-2017T00:46:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nothing will get done if Tom talks
29-12-2017T00:46:27,Dadrobit,"Bullshit, Serp. Your Mad Max references are definitely questionable."
29-12-2017T00:46:37,Serpentfrog,I said never.
29-12-2017T00:46:39,ZRO4825,Just don't get Fluff on the mic. Fluff impregnates chat streams when he talks just right to his mic.
29-12-2017T00:46:50,Tharkis,the ref sheet i had made also answers the question 'how the hell do kemonomimi wear glasses? =P

29-12-2017T11:23:50,Sheeron,Hey pink bat
29-12-2017T13:39:08,RandomTKLover,Who is pink bat?
29-12-2017T13:44:56,TheBeckoner,Hello everyone ^-^
29-12-2017T14:51:22,qwe304,did anyone ask tom about the conflicting timeline given in the most recent ccomic page?
29-12-2017T14:58:17,RandomTKLover,"Flora did say “two months, maybe more” you know"
29-12-2017T14:58:48,RandomTKLover,She probably wasn’t keeping the most precise time
29-12-2017T15:01:15,RandomTKLover,I guess that’s my way of saying no
29-12-2017T15:01:24,RandomTKLover,Hi btw
29-12-2017T15:04:18,MidnightBlue78,hey Sage :ctwokinds-daydreamingkat:
29-12-2017T15:04:39,SageSaga,yo
29-12-2017T15:05:06,FoxxTrotter,E'los... :0)
29-12-2017T15:05:11,MidnightBlue78,Are your internet issues solved?
29-12-2017T15:05:15,RandomTKLover,"Hi sage, just wanted to say that I think ai was hilarious"
29-12-2017T15:05:21,MidnightBlue78,hey Foxx o/
29-12-2017T15:05:24,RandomTKLover,Love it
29-12-2017T15:05:31,SageSaga,glad ya like it!
29-12-2017T15:05:51,RandomTKLover,But I also wanted to ask you something
29-12-2017T15:06:15,RandomTKLover,What exactly is the job of a moderator on picarto
29-12-2017T15:06:44,SageSaga,to enforce the rules set by the streamer
29-12-2017T15:07:58,RandomTKLover,"Ohh, so if you say no spamming, then a moderator can kick or block people for spamming?"
29-12-2017T15:08:36,SageSaga,yep - though that is a general rule so even if thats not written i expect my mods to deal with it if i dont
29-12-2017T15:08:56,RandomTKLover,"Oh, ok"
29-12-2017T15:10:29,RandomTKLover,"Do moderators get paid, or is it voluntary?"
29-12-2017T15:12:08,SageSaga,volunteer work - usually it's status given to close friends or trusted regulars as a way to let them help the streamer out when they are busy
29-12-2017T15:12:24,RandomTKLover,Oh cool
29-12-2017T15:13:46,SageSaga,that way if im busy painting a complex background - someone like Mihari can get rid of a guy who jump in trying to sell everyone penis enlargement pills
29-12-2017T15:14:14,RandomTKLover,Nice example XD
29-12-2017T15:15:12,SageSaga,the no linking rule came into being because someone came in here and posted a link to a virus
29-12-2017T15:15:35,RandomTKLover,"Oh wow, what an asshole"
29-12-2017T15:15:38,SageSaga,and yet still people try to click on links before we delete them
29-12-2017T15:16:16,RandomTKLover,Is that only during streams or all the time
29-12-2017T15:16:46,SageSaga,"ive seen people do it after we ""leave"" and ive seen people try and do it while we are streaming"
29-12-2017T15:17:23,ZRO4825,Heyyo ^_^
29-12-2017T15:17:49,SageSaga,yo Zro

29-12-2017T15:18:21,ZRO4825,"Just woke back up, but I'm okay with this. Been operating on little sleep all week -.-"
29-12-2017T15:19:36,RandomTKLover,"I used to be able to only sleep a little and be fine, but now I just pass out during the streams"
29-12-2017T15:19:39,DontuDare,woag
29-12-2017T15:20:16,ZRO4825,"I used to be the same Random. I still am to an extent, but it's been the last 4 days in a row. And it's been hellish 10 hour shifts all 4 days at work. Eventually ya need a blasted break, lol"

29-12-2017T15:21:41,FoxxTrotter,"Hey, Tom."
29-12-2017T15:21:47,ZRO4825,"Yeah, it's like...half, lol"
29-12-2017T15:22:02,ZRO4825,"And it doesn't even matter if we're talking 'bout the comnic, or the circle of artists o_o"
29-12-2017T15:22:09,ZRO4825,comic*
29-12-2017T15:22:14,ZRO4825,apparently my fingers aren't awake yet...

29-12-2017T15:36:27,Rosscoe,goes to check on hotdogs
29-12-2017T15:36:56,FoxxTrotter,:hotdog::hotdog::hotdog:
29-12-2017T15:37:33,RandomTKLover,steals a hot dog while his back is turned
29-12-2017T15:38:20,TheBeckoner,alsos teals one because making my own is too much work
29-12-2017T15:38:47,DontuDare,Takes bit of pizze
29-12-2017T15:39:00,ZRO4825,Hot dogs? You can have those. Chicken sandwiches however I would happily steal.
29-12-2017T15:39:17,DontuDare,pizza cough
29-12-2017T15:39:33,FoxxTrotter,I can always go to Shorty's and get hot dogs. They some good stuff there. :0)
29-12-2017T15:41:26,ZRO4825,"Nope, don't want pizza. I work in pizza. Do not want right now. :joy:"
29-12-2017T15:41:46,FoxxTrotter,I had pizza last night. :pizza:
29-12-2017T15:41:55,w0lfmare,:cw0lfmare-HeadSil:
29-12-2017T15:41:59,FoxxTrotter,"Hey, w0lf."
29-12-2017T15:42:03,ZRO4825,Heyyo w0lf! ^_^
29-12-2017T15:42:06,w0lfmare,Hello
29-12-2017T15:43:49,Rosscoe,Hi Wolf
29-12-2017T15:47:01,TheBeckoner,Hello wolf
29-12-2017T15:47:23,ZRO4825,Leafy brush ftw!
29-12-2017T15:48:26,Rosscoe,I see it more as a stamp
29-12-2017T15:48:35,ZRO4825,:thinking:
29-12-2017T15:48:45,ZRO4825,I'm trying to remember which CLIP considers it now. :joy:
29-12-2017T15:49:36,Rosscoe,I cant remember my CSP login off the top of my head. Its drainig=ng cause there were some nice tools I downloaded and have on my workstation back in ontario
29-12-2017T15:50:06,ZRO4825,doh :(
29-12-2017T15:50:38,ZRO4825,"And I guess CLIP would consider it a Decoration, lol"
29-12-2017T15:51:20,ZRO4825,":thinking: Nyna's the first digitigrade humanoid character you've had in either comic, isn't she, Sage?"
29-12-2017T15:53:08,SageSaga,main character yes
29-12-2017T16:02:51,RandomTKLover,"Wait, is Nyna the one with the slpit tail, or the elf"
29-12-2017T16:03:07,FoxxTrotter,Split tail.
29-12-2017T16:03:30,FoxxTrotter,Kaylin is the elf.
29-12-2017T16:04:17,RandomTKLover,Oohh yeeaaa
29-12-2017T16:04:29,ZRO4825,Kaylin's the hottie. Nyna's the other hottie. :3
29-12-2017T16:04:31,RandomTKLover,I always forget names
29-12-2017T16:06:56,RandomTKLover,Nyna is cuter in my opinion
29-12-2017T16:08:49,ZRO4825,"I prefer not to compare. I operate on a basis of ""Is she cute/hot or not?"" ^_^"
29-12-2017T16:09:30,ZRO4825,"And even then, that's not really accurate, because that's all based on personal aesthetics. :thinking:"
29-12-2017T16:09:46,ZRO4825,"So it's more like ""Do I consider her attractive in one fashion or another?"""
29-12-2017T16:09:47,RandomTKLover,"In comics, totally. But not in rl"
29-12-2017T16:10:48,ZRO4825,"Eh. Way I see it, the whole ""You shouldn't judge on looks"" is a thing that is and is not really true. Yes, it's true, you shouldn't judge people /as a person/ based on their looks. But, when it comes down to a potential partner, looks are certainly a"
29-12-2017T16:11:05,ZRO4825,"factor to one degree or another. After all, you're not going to want to spend your life with someone you don't feel any attraction to."
29-12-2017T16:11:45,ZRO4825,"Enjoying someone's personality mind you, does tend to factor in quite heavily. After all, don't matter what a person looks like if they're a major PITA, lol."
29-12-2017T16:11:57,RandomTKLover,"True, but I feel after a certain point, looks don’t matter"
29-12-2017T16:11:59,ZRO4825,I think too much for my own good. &gt;_&gt;;
29-12-2017T16:12:22,RandomTKLover,"Like, if a girl is too hot, then I don’t even bother"
29-12-2017T16:12:28,SageSaga,"""I find your personality to be sooooo hot"""
29-12-2017T16:12:37,ZRO4825,lol
29-12-2017T16:12:45,RandomTKLover,😏
29-12-2017T16:13:38,RandomTKLover,I’m not old enough to be worrying about that
29-12-2017T16:15:19,ZRO4825,This a Two Steps From Hell song by chance?
29-12-2017T16:15:29,ZRO4825,"Well, the one that just ended"
29-12-2017T16:16:05,RandomTKLover,I can’t even hear any music
29-12-2017T16:16:21,ZRO4825,Do you by chance not have the sound on for Sage's stream? lol
29-12-2017T16:16:24,SageSaga,Thomas Bergersen
29-12-2017T16:16:56,ZRO4825,"Co-founder of Two Steps from Hell. That makes sense then, lol"
29-12-2017T16:17:29,TheBeckoner,I can hear the music just fine
29-12-2017T16:17:31,RandomTKLover,"Yeah, that’s why"
29-12-2017T16:17:39,RandomTKLover,:ptv-condescending:
29-12-2017T16:17:39,Rosscoe,Nyna looks so coe in that last pannel. I wonder what she is scheming XD
29-12-2017T16:18:23,sunblaze,hiya everyone
29-12-2017T16:18:45,SageSaga,yo Sunblaze!
29-12-2017T16:19:06,ZRO4825,Heyyo Sunblaze
29-12-2017T16:19:25,sunblaze,reindeer blue came out great so thx for that!
29-12-2017T16:20:11,SageSaga,glad ya liked it - wasnt sure about how to do her costume- first idea i had looked too much like bondage gear
29-12-2017T16:20:24,TheBeckoner,lol
29-12-2017T16:20:31,sunblaze,as if she would care
29-12-2017T16:20:58,ZRO4825,":thinking: Not sure Blue's into that. Though I wouldn't put it past her to wear it to embarrass someone, lol"
29-12-2017T16:21:11,SageSaga,Blue will try just about anything at least once :P
29-12-2017T16:21:22,Rosscoe,hello Sunblaze!
29-12-2017T16:21:55,SageSaga,"Even Men, but that was her college years"
29-12-2017T16:22:08,ZRO4825,oh my~
29-12-2017T16:22:44,RandomTKLover,XD
29-12-2017T16:22:53,sunblaze,hey I get her point why choose men if a bunch ob robot (soon catgirl) androids are around
29-12-2017T16:23:26,ZRO4825,Somehow I'm doubting that was what caused that decision. :joy:
29-12-2017T16:23:31,sunblaze,not to mention the aggressive lesbian line (sooo totally true)
29-12-2017T16:23:54,ZRO4825,"lol, I liked that spot in the comic with Kate complaining about aggressive lesbians always hitting on her"
29-12-2017T16:24:18,sunblaze,jep that one
29-12-2017T16:24:29,SageSaga,Lilith is a very aggressive lesbian...
29-12-2017T16:24:31,FoxxTrotter,"Meh, just had a partial power outage here. XP"
29-12-2017T16:24:49,ZRO4825,"I think Phil had it right, Lilith is just aggressive, period. XD"
29-12-2017T16:25:02,ZRO4825,"Definitely can't claim she half asses anything though, lol"
29-12-2017T16:25:04,SageSaga,also true
29-12-2017T16:26:00,SageSaga,Blue is an outgoing lesbian
29-12-2017T16:26:10,Twokinds,I like this music
29-12-2017T16:26:23,ZRO4825,"Heyyo again, Tom, lol, and yeah,it's good stuff =D"
29-12-2017T16:26:28,sunblaze,yo tom
29-12-2017T16:26:45,SageSaga,if you have amazon prime its free
29-12-2017T16:27:24,ZRO4825,"Ain't got no silly prime. I hardly ever order anything off of Amazon, lol"
29-12-2017T16:28:28,SageSaga,yeah but i know Tom does and hes the one who said he likes it :P
29-12-2017T16:28:45,RandomTKLover,Oooooo
29-12-2017T16:28:55,ZRO4825,Valid point!
29-12-2017T16:29:12,w0lfmare,"I'm off to my brother's, thanks for the stream Sage ^^"
29-12-2017T16:29:18,ZRO4825,Take care w0lf! ^^/
29-12-2017T16:29:20,SageSaga,take care w0lf!
29-12-2017T16:29:27,w0lfmare,Later everyone
29-12-2017T16:29:27,RandomTKLover,0/
29-12-2017T16:29:31,FoxxTrotter,"C-ya, w0lf."
29-12-2017T16:29:33,ZRO4825,Trying to remember what the last thing I ordered off Amazon was...might've been my flute :thinking:
29-12-2017T16:30:07,RandomTKLover,There is this cool thing called order history
29-12-2017T16:31:09,ZRO4825,"Yeah, there is. But I didn't feel like going to amazon to check atm. :rofl:"
29-12-2017T16:31:24,RandomTKLover,Me all the time
29-12-2017T16:31:43,ZRO4825,I think I have it open in another tab atm actually...
29-12-2017T16:31:52,ZRO4825,"Yup, there's the symbol."
29-12-2017T16:34:18,RandomTKLover,"Ok, I need to eat. I’m becoming an asshole. Be back in a few"
29-12-2017T16:34:53,ZRO4825,And there was much Hangry.
29-12-2017T16:35:20,RandomTKLover,True that. Brb
29-12-2017T16:35:38,ZRO4825,"May I throw out an amazon link, Sage?"
29-12-2017T16:35:43,ZRO4825,Tis to a controller~
29-12-2017T16:35:54,SageSaga,go ahead
29-12-2017T16:35:57,ZRO4825,https://www.amazon.com/Thrustmaster-T-16000M-FCS-HOTAS-Controller/dp/B01KCHPRXA
29-12-2017T16:36:10,ZRO4825,"I want this thing, cuz friends showed it to me. But I can't justify it right now."
29-12-2017T16:36:21,ZRO4825,But it looks like such a fun controller! lol
29-12-2017T16:36:42,SageSaga,why you call that a controller?
29-12-2017T16:37:19,ZRO4825,Because it says it in the link? lol
29-12-2017T16:37:58,SageSaga,but its obviously a joystick- do kids these days not know what joystick is?
29-12-2017T16:38:08,SageSaga,what a*
29-12-2017T16:38:16,ZRO4825,"Funny story, if you look up just the joystick part, it DOES call it a joystick, iirc, lol"
29-12-2017T16:38:58,Rosscoe,So its a flight sim joystick with hand throttle.
29-12-2017T16:39:01,ZRO4825,"I'm kinda itching to get it though, because there's a new Mechwarrior finally being made (besides the crap that is MWO)"
29-12-2017T16:39:21,SageSaga,but hardly anything supports joysticks anymore
29-12-2017T16:39:55,ZRO4825,Really? That seems silly. I should hope all the flight sims at least do.
29-12-2017T16:40:09,ZRO4825,"Anything else though, besides like, Mechwarrior games and similar, I can kinda understand I suppose."
29-12-2017T16:40:37,ZRO4825,"Like, I'd rather use my PS4 or Xbone controller for racing/driving (or a good steering wheel, which the one I own is NOT)"
29-12-2017T16:40:41,SageSaga,"""I play all my fighting games with a F-22 figher joystick"""
29-12-2017T16:41:02,ZRO4825,XD

29-12-2017T16:45:06,TheBeckoner,Tanks
29-12-2017T16:45:16,ZRO4825,I played WarThunder for a small bit. Just couldn't really get into it well enough to bother sticking with it.
29-12-2017T16:45:32,SageSaga,ya know- if they werent doing a PC release at all-
29-12-2017T16:45:38,SageSaga,i would have bought a PS4 Pro
29-12-2017T16:45:53,RandomTKLover,I used to love wot ob my iPad for the longest time
29-12-2017T16:46:16,TheBeckoner,World of Tanks? I was a beta tester for the mobile version
29-12-2017T16:46:27,TheBeckoner,We all got the Pz 2j lol
29-12-2017T16:46:32,TheBeckoner,lots of fun
29-12-2017T16:46:40,RandomTKLover,Oh cool
29-12-2017T16:47:05,TheBeckoner,The PC version is mainly what I played though
29-12-2017T16:49:00,RandomTKLover,I could only play on my iPad because I don’t have a pc
29-12-2017T16:49:45,TheBeckoner,Wait in wot on console too?
29-12-2017T16:49:50,TheBeckoner,I cant remember
29-12-2017T16:49:54,Rosscoe,"I mainly play Tanks in Warthunder, but I do like flying bombers"
29-12-2017T16:50:03,Rosscoe,Ye they made  console version
29-12-2017T16:50:19,TheBeckoner,Ooh didnt know that
29-12-2017T16:50:22,Rosscoe,"and console version uses a gunenrs sight on each tank, not a pin point sniepr mode off he fonr ot the gun like on PC XD"
29-12-2017T16:51:08,TheBeckoner,I haven't played war thunder planes in a while...
29-12-2017T16:51:15,TheBeckoner,I should probably
29-12-2017T16:51:33,SageSaga,im just gonna point out-
29-12-2017T16:51:49,SageSaga,i had an argument with a squirrel in my dream about MHW
29-12-2017T16:52:09,sunblaze,^too much MHW I guess :D
29-12-2017T16:52:28,SageSaga,how can i have had too much?
29-12-2017T16:52:36,ZRO4825,Not enough~
29-12-2017T16:52:42,SageSaga,when i only got an hour or two with it
29-12-2017T16:52:56,Rosscoe,lol
29-12-2017T16:53:02,ZRO4825,"Yeah, even I've had more time with it, and I'm not even a long-time MH fan!"
29-12-2017T16:53:19,ZRO4825,I DO like the armors from it though. Kirin armor was always a nice design on the females. &lt;3
29-12-2017T16:53:38,TheBeckoner,MHW?
29-12-2017T16:53:53,Rosscoe,Monster Hunter World
29-12-2017T16:55:15,RandomTKLover,Merijuana
29-12-2017T16:55:33,RandomTKLover,"Aaggg, i cant spell"
29-12-2017T16:55:49,SageSaga,i guess when it does come out i should start a guild/clan
29-12-2017T16:56:04,TheBeckoner,Oh yeah
29-12-2017T16:56:28,TheBeckoner,When is that supposed to come out?
29-12-2017T16:56:42,ZRO4825,"I need to get more money on the job. Too many games coming up already this year. Dragonball FighterZ, MHW, SoulCalibur 6 (that one is probably going to own my soul for a while)"
29-12-2017T16:57:39,SageSaga,MHW has no release date yet for the PC release but it comes out for PS4 and Xbone/X Jan 26th
29-12-2017T16:57:47,SageSaga,same day DBFZ comes out
29-12-2017T16:59:06,ZRO4825,That...seems like a bad business choice on Capcom's part to me.
29-12-2017T16:59:17,SageSaga,how?
29-12-2017T16:59:39,ZRO4825,"I mean, don't get me wrong, two different genres, but gamers a lot of times aren't the type to lock themselves to one genre."
29-12-2017T17:00:07,ZRO4825,"Fighting games are a niche, but, Dragonball is HUGE. That game's had more hype already than new installations of most prior fighting game series."
29-12-2017T17:00:27,eric190,yo
29-12-2017T17:00:31,SageSaga,ok so - how is that a mistake by Capcom?
29-12-2017T17:00:52,ZRO4825,They're basically putting MHW up against DBFZ for sales.
29-12-2017T17:01:01,ZRO4825,Just strikes me as a bad idea.
29-12-2017T17:01:15,SageSaga,MHW announced first- they are different companies
29-12-2017T17:01:34,ZRO4825,"Well yes, I'm quite aware they're different companies."
29-12-2017T17:01:56,SageSaga,pretty sure MH games sell better than DB games
29-12-2017T17:01:59,Rosscoe,Sage if your doing a guild / clan I'll so be there
29-12-2017T17:04:30,TheBeckoner,I really wish fallout 4 hasn't uninstalled itself...
29-12-2017T17:04:34,SageSaga,MHX sold a million more copies in japan than Xenoverse sold world wide
29-12-2017T17:04:40,TheBeckoner,hadn't*
29-12-2017T17:05:27,SageSaga,MHW has also had much better press than DBFZ
29-12-2017T17:06:08,ZRO4825,Has it? Because I've seen a lot more DBFZ than MHW myself.
29-12-2017T17:07:02,SageSaga,MHW has had 2 very successful open betas and has announced that they wont be doing any lootbox and most DLC will be free
29-12-2017T17:07:15,SageSaga,DBFZ is getting slammed for how they plan to do DLC
29-12-2017T17:07:17,ZRO4825,"That being said, I haven't really gone looking for either one for the most part, but, the channels I do watch/follow have been more interested in DBFZ."
29-12-2017T17:07:39,ZRO4825,Every company gets slammed for doing DLC. That's nothing new nor surprising.
29-12-2017T17:08:09,ZRO4825,"Capcom might be doing free DLC for MHW, but they've been slammed several times for the crap that's been involved in MvC:I"
29-12-2017T17:08:11,SageSaga,except the press for MHW is better because of their anti-paid dlc/lootbox stance
29-12-2017T17:08:28,SageSaga,rumor is that DBFZ has worse DLC than MvC:I
29-12-2017T17:08:47,ZRO4825,Wouldn't surprise me. ArkSys is bad about that in general.
29-12-2017T17:09:15,SageSaga,so when i say the press is better- i dont mean there is more- theres plenty of both
29-12-2017T17:09:16,ZRO4825,And I still haven't bought their latest fighting games because they suddenly started deciding that we didn't need English voices anymore in two different series that they've religiously done English voices for.
29-12-2017T17:09:31,SageSaga,but the press for MHW is mostly positive while DBFZ is all over the place
29-12-2017T17:09:39,ZRO4825,REALLY not happy with ArkSys about not giving English voices for BlazBlue's latest iteration. &gt;:(
29-12-2017T17:09:59,Rosscoe,I found the english voices to be a little too repeditive
29-12-2017T17:10:15,ZRO4825,"That's because you can understand them. If you actually pay attention, the Japanese ones are just as bad about that, lol"
29-12-2017T17:12:51,SageSaga,funny thing is- im probably going to be getting DBFZ before i get MHW simply because- PC RELEASE DATE NOT FOUND
29-12-2017T17:13:28,ZRO4825,I didn't know you played fighters :o
29-12-2017T17:13:45,SageSaga,yep
29-12-2017T17:14:02,ZRO4825,"I play the crap out of'em, but the only one I think I'm actually any better than halfway decent at is SoulCalibur, lol"
29-12-2017T17:14:33,ZRO4825,"That being said, I'll most likely be picking up DBFZ just because I love DBZ. Silly me grew up on it, lol"
29-12-2017T17:14:35,SageSaga,i only likes SoulCalibur for the custom characters
29-12-2017T17:14:57,TheBeckoner,I like tank because it make boom
29-12-2017T17:15:05,TheBeckoner,and squish
29-12-2017T17:15:13,ZRO4825,"A lot of people like it for that, and I don't see that as a problem. I love the gameplay of it myself. 6 looks like it's going to be GOOD, but, still reserving judgment after what they did with 5."
29-12-2017T17:15:37,SageSaga,i'll probably wait for DBFZ to go on sale actually and have lower cost DLC packs
29-12-2017T17:15:52,ZRO4825,"Do you go online with the fighters, Sage?"
29-12-2017T17:16:07,SageSaga,no - thats how you get your ego bruised!
29-12-2017T17:16:28,SageSaga,i dont need a 12 year old messaging me to git gud scrub
29-12-2017T17:17:07,SageSaga,id rather watch their little brains struggle with MH and then show them how its done
29-12-2017T17:17:09,Rosscoe,"I see enough of that in EVE online by a group who soles purpose ot is gank everyone, tell the mt oget gud or pay them ISK for protection XD"
29-12-2017T17:17:11,ZRO4825,"lol, can't argue that. I don't go online either myself."
29-12-2017T17:17:30,Rosscoe,I wonder how much character customizeation you can do in MHW
29-12-2017T17:17:33,ZRO4825,That...sounds like a horrible thing to have happen in a game like that Ross.
29-12-2017T17:17:43,ZRO4825,It's pretty decent from what I saw in the beta.
29-12-2017T17:17:54,ZRO4825,"Not SUPER customizable, but, we'll see when full version comes out."
29-12-2017T17:18:03,SageSaga,the beta had presets only
29-12-2017T17:18:08,ZRO4825,Yar
29-12-2017T17:18:09,SageSaga,the main game has a lot of customization
29-12-2017T17:18:25,SageSaga,you can look it up on youtube
29-12-2017T17:18:28,SageSaga,whole videos on it
29-12-2017T17:19:18,ZRO4825,"Now if only Capcom woould fix up SFV a bit. I enjoy that, even took it online a few times, but haven't been playing much because I can't afford to get the added characters since the beginning. :joy:"
29-12-2017T17:19:39,ZRO4825,"Though, it does look like they're touching it up a good bit when they do this ""Arcade Edition"" upgrade, so that may be worth dropping the money on."
29-12-2017T17:22:19,Rosscoe,Cause a coop game that has online support for coop play you kinda want to be your alter ego in a game like that :)
29-12-2017T17:22:38,ZRO4825,I usually design a chick that I like the look of. :joy:
29-12-2017T17:22:50,ZRO4825,I'm a simple man. I make what I wanna see. =D
29-12-2017T17:22:53,SageSaga,the last game i made Kaylin
29-12-2017T17:22:58,ZRO4825,:o
29-12-2017T17:23:49,SageSaga,the one before that i think i made Nami
29-12-2017T17:23:55,ZRO4825,Nice ^_^
29-12-2017T17:24:01,SageSaga,i also made Sage but i didnt use him much
29-12-2017T17:24:15,ZRO4825,Poor Sage. Ignored for his own ladies.
29-12-2017T17:24:37,ZRO4825,"I'm assuming in the full game, you don't start with a bunch of different armors like we did on the beta."
29-12-2017T17:24:44,SageSaga,nah
29-12-2017T17:24:58,ZRO4825,"taking a guess, but you have to get the parts off the monsters to make the pieces of the armor sets and/or better weapons?"
29-12-2017T17:24:59,SageSaga,gotta make your armors and weapons- you should start with one of each weapon though
29-12-2017T17:25:09,SageSaga,yep
29-12-2017T17:25:14,SageSaga,thats how monster hunter works
29-12-2017T17:25:22,ZRO4825,"Aight, that's what I figured from what I was seeing, but like I mentioned, no previous MH experience outside of demos~"
29-12-2017T17:25:23,SageSaga,kill monsters- get parts- make better gear
29-12-2017T17:26:26,ZRO4825,"And are armor/weapons upgradeable? Like if you get the Kirin set (just example, can't remember the other names) and you like it, can you upgrade it instead of having to change to a better set?"
29-12-2017T17:27:01,SageSaga,yep - all armor and weapons are upgradeable- some upgrades will change their appearance or branch off
29-12-2017T17:27:10,ZRO4825,Huh. Nifty.
29-12-2017T17:27:28,ZRO4825,Now I'm really curious to see the full game. I wish they'd shown a bit more of that in the demo instead of JUST the hunts.
29-12-2017T17:27:38,ZRO4825,"But, I guess it IS just a demo, lol"
29-12-2017T17:27:48,Rosscoe,"I tend to make an alter ego of myself, and make an alt of whatever if the most uglyest thing I can come up with"
29-12-2017T17:28:04,ZRO4825,why? XD
29-12-2017T17:28:29,SageSaga,http://mhgen.kiranico.com/chargeblade
29-12-2017T17:28:59,SageSaga,Rosscoe will have to have his helmet toggled on at all times
29-12-2017T17:30:10,ZRO4825,XD
29-12-2017T17:30:31,ZRO4825,Some of those weapons look awesome~

29-12-2017T17:32:48,Bgrmystr2,"well, my friend went home without any words"
29-12-2017T17:32:52,Bgrmystr2,so.

29-12-2017T17:33:33,ZRO4825,Sometimes
29-12-2017T17:33:36,ZRO4825,Not all the time~
29-12-2017T17:33:36,Bgrmystr2,sometimes.
29-12-2017T17:33:38,ZRO4825,I should know.
29-12-2017T17:33:51,SageSaga,"we're all alone, the laws of physics prevents us from ever having physical contact"
29-12-2017T17:33:51,TheBeckoner,Did something happen to them?
29-12-2017T17:33:55,ZRO4825,"Always alone...well, 'cept for when talkin to peeps via discord and such."
29-12-2017T17:34:05,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-unimpressed: sage pls
29-12-2017T17:34:15,TheBeckoner,Technically he's right
29-12-2017T17:34:19,SageSaga,its true
29-12-2017T17:34:21,TheBeckoner,yah cant ever touch anything
29-12-2017T17:34:21,DontuDare,being alone is my faovorite
29-12-2017T17:34:33,Bgrmystr2,hence why I said that.
29-12-2017T17:34:35,Bgrmystr2,:P
29-12-2017T17:35:19,SageSaga,"you know what Fusion said to the particles around it? ""Let's touch intimately"""
29-12-2017T17:35:33,Rosscoe,You know in Blak Desert online I made a goblin dark knight character XD
29-12-2017T17:36:43,Rosscoe,Thats quite the charge blade helmet stats page sage
29-12-2017T17:36:45,Bgrmystr2,Guessing you're gonna be goin to D&D tonight Sage? :o
29-12-2017T17:37:00,SageSaga,yep
29-12-2017T17:37:35,SageSaga,Savage Worlds Super Heroes in Space actually but yes
29-12-2017T17:39:03,SageSaga,"it's like- Star Trek, with a colony sized ship, with super heroes"
29-12-2017T17:39:20,ZRO4825,"o.O; That sounds interesting, and at the same time, a great recipe for disaster, lol"
29-12-2017T17:39:34,Bgrmystr2,"you still goin with the same people? Fluff, Tom, and Mihari? :o"
29-12-2017T17:39:45,ZRO4825,I'm hoping this ship is capable of withstanding the goings-ons with superhero strengths and such :joy:
29-12-2017T17:39:50,SageSaga,"and Silver, yep"
29-12-2017T17:39:54,Bgrmystr2,cool
29-12-2017T17:40:12,Bgrmystr2,glad to know it's still doin well. :thumbsup:
29-12-2017T17:40:18,SageSaga,if the ship broke down Mihari could get out and push
29-12-2017T17:40:29,Twokinds,I'm a tentacle monster :D
29-12-2017T17:40:29,ZRO4825,XD
29-12-2017T17:41:06,Rosscoe,So Toms the Kraken in this case
29-12-2017T17:41:33,Bgrmystr2,":ptv-ohmy: You didn't transfer from Japan, did you Tom?"
29-12-2017T17:41:35,SageSaga,and silver is a robot
29-12-2017T17:41:52,Bgrmystr2,"sounds like a lot of fun, honestly"
29-12-2017T17:42:51,SageSaga,Mihari's character is like 170 years old
29-12-2017T17:43:38,Rosscoe,So we talking 170 years old as in old age or 170 years old as in young? Cause Elves thinking in age here :P
29-12-2017T17:43:40,SageSaga,"still looks 18, she used to look 16 but she had some help from another hero to help her finish maturing a bit"
29-12-2017T17:44:18,SageSaga,she's ageless - her power keeps her cells from ever breaking down
29-12-2017T17:44:52,Bgrmystr2,"lool, that's a classic"

29-12-2017T17:45:33,SageSaga,Fluff is a - uhhhh- doctor?
29-12-2017T17:45:52,ZRO4825,....Suddenly I'm picturing Fluff's Raine birb in a labcoat.
29-12-2017T17:46:06,Bgrmystr2,xD
29-12-2017T17:46:11,Bgrmystr2,Rane*
29-12-2017T17:46:25,Bgrmystr2,Raine is from TK :P
29-12-2017T17:46:52,SageSaga,hes a scientist of some kind- i dont remember his powers-
29-12-2017T17:47:01,Rosscoe,"Anyrate I'll have to check out the cusomtizeation video for MHW, wonder if you can a non human thing in it"
29-12-2017T17:47:15,SageSaga,i think it was Energy manipulation and - absorption
29-12-2017T17:47:17,ZRO4825,"ty Bgr, too much Raine in my Rane"
29-12-2017T17:47:43,SageSaga,all hunters are human
29-12-2017T17:47:47,Bgrmystr2,"Better than the alternative, Zro XD :ptv-laugh:"
29-12-2017T17:50:53,TheBeckoner,#TomIsATentacleMonster2018
29-12-2017T17:51:50,Rosscoe,Human only?
29-12-2017T17:52:45,Rosscoe,Well I guess it has to be.
29-12-2017T17:53:40,SageSaga,all done
29-12-2017T17:53:48,ZRO4825,"Nice, Sage =D"
29-12-2017T17:53:56,Rosscoe,Its  pretty piece.
29-12-2017T17:54:04,TheBeckoner,Looks good. Im gonna have to read your comic lol
29-12-2017T17:54:14,Rosscoe,Your colouring has come along to Sage.
29-12-2017T17:54:16,Bgrmystr2,I like this page
29-12-2017T17:54:38,Bgrmystr2,I can already tell something about this page
29-12-2017T17:54:49,Bgrmystr2,feels like this is a 'join me' kinda deal
29-12-2017T17:55:20,SageSaga,http://ai.katbox.net/
29-12-2017T17:58:56,FoxxTrotter,:0)
29-12-2017T17:59:30,ZRO4825,"That one's adorable. Mihari and one of her characters, I assume?"
29-12-2017T18:00:06,SageSaga,the one im coloring is Mihari and Nami
29-12-2017T18:00:17,TheBeckoner,I made my quesadilla too hot :cry:
29-12-2017T18:01:01,ZRO4825,"I was thinking it might be Nami, but I have a bad habit of doubting my first choice all the time, lol"
29-12-2017T18:01:52,SageSaga,Nami is one of Mihari's favorite Yosh! characters
29-12-2017T18:02:13,ZRO4825,For good reason imo!
29-12-2017T18:02:59,ZRO4825,Where's her cat-ears? They're her new thing. :P
29-12-2017T18:05:10,SageSaga,shes not going to wear those all the time
29-12-2017T18:05:24,ZRO4825,"lol, I figured as much, but they are cute ^_^"
29-12-2017T18:05:38,Rosscoe,"Oh I se it now, its a new years selfie!"
29-12-2017T18:05:55,SageSaga,yep
29-12-2017T18:06:30,TheBeckoner,"Good news, Fallout didn't actually uninstall, steam just stopped recognizing the launcher :smile:"
29-12-2017T18:07:04,Rosscoe,lol
29-12-2017T18:07:36,TheBeckoner,This is good because f04 is 32gb and I have 12 down lol
29-12-2017T18:10:27,Rosscoe,ARK with current expansions + free DLC (didnt install Primitive) the game is 129 gigs now
29-12-2017T18:10:50,ZRO4825,do what now? o.o;
29-12-2017T18:11:04,SageSaga,i wanna play more Ark again
29-12-2017T18:11:49,ZRO4825,That's crazy. I've seen MMOs with like 5 expansions don't take up that much space. D:
29-12-2017T18:11:50,TheBeckoner,Wow thats a solid 50+ hour download for me
29-12-2017T18:11:56,Rosscoe,So you plan to play ARK and not the expansions then dont check on the expansion map content to save 6- 80 gigs XD
29-12-2017T18:12:08,Rosscoe,60-80*
29-12-2017T18:12:20,Bgrmystr2,129gb? What in the fuck xD
29-12-2017T18:12:20,TheBeckoner,6-80 is a pretty wide range there lol
29-12-2017T18:12:34,ZRO4825,"I could probably get it down within a few hours with my connection, but holy freaking hell."
29-12-2017T18:12:35,Rosscoe,"the new expansion is rather...huuuuge. Like I dicied to start at the protal spawn, its massive"
29-12-2017T18:13:05,Bgrmystr2,"is there really that much content, or is it just obssessively detailed high quality renders?"
29-12-2017T18:13:13,Rosscoe,"Yea, I kinda wish though the devs would have made the HD textures (Very High setting in the graphic menu under textures) would have been a seprate download"
29-12-2017T18:13:46,ZRO4825,"Oh, yeah, textures will do that. I remember getting into HD texture mods on Skyrim, lol"
29-12-2017T18:13:55,Bgrmystr2,"that'd prolly explain a lot. If they have super-high level graphics included in all copies of the game, it'll be huge but barely anyone will be utilizing them"
29-12-2017T18:13:57,Rosscoe,"The biggest HDD eater for ARK is the texture files, cause they get absurb, 2nd up would be the model files"
29-12-2017T18:14:38,SageSaga,i love this song
29-12-2017T18:14:43,Rosscoe,Sadly thoug hI do not see Xbobx one or PS4 using the HD textures so they wil have a smaller size
29-12-2017T18:15:18,Rosscoe,"Ah Sage, those are pretty revelling dress's she has them wearing again"
29-12-2017T18:15:45,ZRO4825,"Nah, those aren't that bad. Just high sides."
29-12-2017T18:16:01,ZRO4825,"Well, and strapless in Mihari's case, lol"
29-12-2017T18:16:03,Rosscoe,The proper word would be  Thigh Highs :3
29-12-2017T18:16:11,ZRO4825,"No, thigh-highs are a type of sock. :P"
29-12-2017T18:16:16,TheBeckoner,"Fallout has this dumb thing where are the textures (even tiny bullet shells) are put at 2k resolution on the high setting, and it make the game laggy af in shoot outs"
29-12-2017T18:16:31,ZRO4825,....why would bullet hole textures need to be 2k? wtf? lol
29-12-2017T18:16:32,TheBeckoner,makes* all*
29-12-2017T18:16:42,ZRO4825,"oh, wait, bullet shells, lol"
29-12-2017T18:16:49,Rosscoe,Yea I never understood that for some dev studios
29-12-2017T18:16:52,ZRO4825,I read that as bullet holes for some reason. Stupid skimming brain. :joy:
29-12-2017T18:17:02,TheBeckoner,Those are 2k as well lol
29-12-2017T18:17:02,Rosscoe,its like we must give EVERYTHING a 2K+ texture
29-12-2017T18:17:22,Bgrmystr2,Some people have gpus that can handle that
29-12-2017T18:17:31,TheBeckoner,I just got a 1080ti and even it struggles without the de-2k-afying mod lol
29-12-2017T18:17:46,ZRO4825,Mine MIGHT be able to I think. But I think my CPU/mobo might be bottlenecking me at times.
29-12-2017T18:17:51,Bgrmystr2,"gpus are really powerful, they can handle that kinda stuff."
29-12-2017T18:17:53,ZRO4825,I've got a 970 myself.
29-12-2017T18:17:58,Bgrmystr2,"You probably have other bottlenecks, Beck"
29-12-2017T18:18:10,Rosscoe,"I just buy the games and use at most high setting for textures, I dont see a need to waste GPU power / heat for a 17 inch screen, if I upgrad hte creen it will be a 20 INCH"
29-12-2017T18:19:08,TheBeckoner,"Youre correct, I have a cruddy 4770k that happens to have a really really hot die. Im about to upgrade to coffee lake stuff"
29-12-2017T18:19:12,Rosscoe,and I still wouldnt likely go past high XD
29-12-2017T18:19:19,TheBeckoner,And fo4 is very cpu intense
29-12-2017T18:19:29,TheBeckoner,vs other things
29-12-2017T18:19:53,SageSaga,"""LOOK AT THESE FREAKN BULLET CASINGS! THEY ARE GORGEOUS"""
29-12-2017T18:20:12,Rosscoe,I rather look at a 4K print of this picture your drawing Sage
29-12-2017T18:20:13,sunblaze,yay :P
29-12-2017T18:20:19,TheBeckoner,"I also got the haswell i7 thinking I could overclock it not realizing that haswell is a ""eco"" chipset lol"
29-12-2017T18:20:30,sunblaze,rosscoe has it! straight to the point
29-12-2017T18:20:41,Bgrmystr2,You should get better cooling if you go with intel CPUs
29-12-2017T18:20:46,TheBeckoner,That lip tho
29-12-2017T18:20:59,SageSaga,impossible- this is only a 2.6k image
29-12-2017T18:21:21,TheBeckoner,I have a h100i but when I go coffee im gonna do the i5 and something that is 280mm range
29-12-2017T18:21:33,SageSaga,for cooling on my i7700K i put a baby sized heatsink on it
29-12-2017T18:21:39,TheBeckoner,the coffee i7 gets stupid hot for me to justify buyin it
29-12-2017T18:23:08,TheBeckoner,the 8700k is 33% faster than the 4770k and has way better thermals and OC potential :ok_hand:
29-12-2017T18:23:28,TheBeckoner,Now to fork over way too much money to play video games...
29-12-2017T18:23:42,SageSaga,im not kidding btw- my heat sink is like the size of a newborn baby human
29-12-2017T18:23:48,TheBeckoner,lol
29-12-2017T18:23:55,TheBeckoner,thats uhhh
29-12-2017T18:23:58,TheBeckoner,pretty big?
29-12-2017T18:24:00,SageSaga,NH-D15
29-12-2017T18:24:05,TheBeckoner,oh yeah
29-12-2017T18:24:25,TheBeckoner,that thing is huge
29-12-2017T18:24:32,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, that's what I plan to get when I upgrade my system"
29-12-2017T18:24:34,Bgrmystr2,whenever it happens
29-12-2017T18:24:44,TheBeckoner,I went with the h100i coz I wanna see my leds yo
29-12-2017T18:25:36,TheBeckoner,sadly nothing can cool an unhappy i7...
29-12-2017T18:26:28,Bgrmystr2,Liquid Nytrogen.
29-12-2017T18:26:33,Bgrmystr2,"Do not recommend, but yes."
29-12-2017T18:26:34,Rosscoe,Well Sage its still better to look at then a game shell casing XD
29-12-2017T18:26:35,Bgrmystr2,Yes it can.
29-12-2017T18:27:17,TheBeckoner,lol
29-12-2017T18:27:54,TheBeckoner,I need a new monitor too. Im really squandering the beauty of this 1080ti at 1080p
29-12-2017T18:28:32,Rosscoe,I like ot enjoy my games
29-12-2017T18:28:55,Rosscoe,And smooth playing is a must
29-12-2017T18:29:13,ZRO4825,I personally don't know if bumping up to 4k is really a great thing. I think I'd almost rather just crank everything to max at 1080 and enjoy it running smoothly.
29-12-2017T18:29:30,Bgrmystr2,tis what I do with my 760
29-12-2017T18:29:34,Bgrmystr2,run 1080p
29-12-2017T18:29:44,Bgrmystr2,but that's cuz I have 3 monitors running all the time
29-12-2017T18:29:46,Rosscoe,"Like if your using 4K textures you must have a big monitor like 50 inch, or a wall screen projector :P"
29-12-2017T18:30:11,ZRO4825,"Yeah, because below that, what's the point? lol"
29-12-2017T18:30:17,Bgrmystr2,"so I've got a 5760x1080 display space, with a lot of stuff going xD"
29-12-2017T18:30:40,SageSaga,my display space is a L shape-
29-12-2017T18:30:44,Bgrmystr2,"and 50inch is actually not THAT necessary for 4k, but I remember it being like.. 4k or something?"
29-12-2017T18:30:55,Bgrmystr2,er
29-12-2017T18:30:56,Bgrmystr2,40+
29-12-2017T18:30:58,Bgrmystr2,about
29-12-2017T18:31:04,Bgrmystr2,40inch or so?
29-12-2017T18:31:13,SageSaga,Monitor - Monitor -
29-12-2017T18:31:17,SageSaga,and a monitor here
29-12-2017T18:31:33,Bgrmystr2,yeah running corner desks are great for multi-monitor setups
29-12-2017T18:31:37,Bgrmystr2,tis what I have
29-12-2017T18:32:17,Rosscoe,My old L shape desk is falling part
29-12-2017T18:32:30,Rosscoe,when I left the farm to move east the centre was bowing out
29-12-2017T18:33:00,Rosscoe,"Now I found a nice light weight but very sturdy metal desk with a single drawer, I wanted to get the other tone too but no room to set up for an l shape"
29-12-2017T18:33:13,Rosscoe,be amazed at what I been finding out here in Nova Scotia for used sales
29-12-2017T18:33:13,ZRO4825,"Yeah, I can't really run a multi-monitor setup myself. Well, not side-by-side at least."
29-12-2017T18:33:27,ZRO4825,Not enough desk space.
29-12-2017T18:33:28,Bgrmystr2,"need a bigger desk, zro"
29-12-2017T18:33:38,ZRO4825,But I love this old 1970s behemoth of a small desk.
29-12-2017T18:33:51,ZRO4825,"I've had this thing since I was like 12 or some shit, lol"
29-12-2017T18:34:10,Bgrmystr2,"if it's not big enough to have multiple monitors, it's not a behemoth."
29-12-2017T18:34:24,ZRO4825,You wouldn't be saying that if you had to move the fat bastard. &lt;_&lt;;
29-12-2017T18:34:39,Bgrmystr2,"Yes I would, cuz my desk is massive."
29-12-2017T18:34:41,Bgrmystr2,:v
29-12-2017T18:34:49,SageSaga,there is my layout XD
29-12-2017T18:34:57,Bgrmystr2,lolo
29-12-2017T18:35:06,Bgrmystr2,Sage with the interesting layout
29-12-2017T18:35:09,Bgrmystr2,but not something I would want
29-12-2017T18:35:17,Bgrmystr2,Useful for you though
29-12-2017T18:35:44,SageSaga,my monitor on the right is centered with the keyboard IRL - i could never handle having the space between monitors dead center XD
29-12-2017T18:35:49,sunblaze,do you even use the TV?
29-12-2017T18:35:56,sunblaze,seems kinda hight
29-12-2017T18:36:07,ZRO4825,"I've just got a TV that is potentially second monitor set up above my monitor, myself. Well, that, and I use the TV for consoles, obviously."
29-12-2017T18:36:18,SageSaga,i can stream stuff to the TV but right now it just shows sexy pictures and the time. temp and weather
29-12-2017T18:36:27,Nekonny,o/
29-12-2017T18:36:29,sunblaze,:D
29-12-2017T18:36:31,Bgrmystr2,hey Ron
29-12-2017T18:36:32,Nekonny,heya sage
29-12-2017T18:36:34,SageSaga,yo
29-12-2017T18:36:35,Nekonny,heya eveybody
29-12-2017T18:36:38,FoxxTrotter,"Hey, Neko."
29-12-2017T18:36:39,sunblaze,yo nekonny
29-12-2017T18:36:42,Bgrmystr2,I just use my TV as another monitor
29-12-2017T18:36:59,ZRO4825,Heyyo Ron!
29-12-2017T18:37:50,SageSaga,i can stream my desktop to my tv or i can stream my cell phone up there or play my switch on it or pretty much anything
29-12-2017T18:38:32,Bgrmystr2,yeah that's pretty normal with the right wiring :P
29-12-2017T18:38:52,SageSaga,i have an HDMI switch on my desk as well as a network switch
29-12-2017T18:38:54,ZRO4825,"Yeah, but finding people capable of ""right wiring"" anymore is hilariously difficult :joy:"
29-12-2017T18:39:35,Nekonny,tvs usually arent that great for collor fidelity
29-12-2017T18:40:03,Bgrmystr2,"I basically have a similar setup to sage, but instead of having the TV on the wall above my two computer monitors, it's on the desk in between the monitors"
29-12-2017T18:40:33,Bgrmystr2,granted I don't have a tablet or whatnot cuz I don't draw
29-12-2017T18:41:04,Bgrmystr2,but the TV I've got I can connect to prettymuch anything.
29-12-2017T18:41:37,Bgrmystr2,"can watch tv, play xbox, or use it as pc monitor, switch anytime. Use speakers on my monitors + the stereo for audio too"
29-12-2017T18:41:39,ZRO4825,"Yeah, gotta admit, I've noticed the color differences with both the monitor and TV running, and I never actually noticed it when I was just using the TV as a monitor."
29-12-2017T18:41:54,Bgrmystr2,"hell, I can use my stereo for computer AND console audio at the same time. :v"
29-12-2017T18:42:14,Bgrmystr2,&lt;3 desk so versatile
29-12-2017T18:42:21,Rosscoe,heya Nekonny!
29-12-2017T18:42:38,Bgrmystr2,TVs aren't made to handle really small text like computer monitors have
29-12-2017T18:42:44,Bgrmystr2,they're not made with the pixel density
29-12-2017T18:43:04,Bgrmystr2,tis why monitors tend to be more expensive for what looks like the same thing
29-12-2017T18:43:15,Bgrmystr2,TVs have gotten better over the years though
29-12-2017T18:43:45,ZRO4825,"Mine seemed to handle the text just fine as long as the HDMI was going straight from comp to TV. Once I put a switch in the middle, for some reason that fucked with it."
29-12-2017T18:44:13,Bgrmystr2,Was your switch set to 720p? or 1080i?
29-12-2017T18:44:20,ZRO4825,It didn't have an option~
29-12-2017T18:44:28,Bgrmystr2,there's an option in the switch settings
29-12-2017T18:44:32,ZRO4825,"It's just an HDMI switch, I would assume the data just gets sent straight through."
29-12-2017T18:44:40,ZRO4825,"Uh...no, Bgr, there's no switch settings, lol"
29-12-2017T18:44:52,Bgrmystr2,"The Nintendo Switch has settings, zro"
29-12-2017T18:45:00,ZRO4825,"switch, not Switch"
29-12-2017T18:45:11,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
29-12-2017T18:45:17,ZRO4825,As in an HDMI switch.
29-12-2017T18:45:35,ZRO4825,As in I push the button and it changes which HDMI line is going to the TV. :P
29-12-2017T18:45:45,Bgrmystr2,does your display only have one HDMI input?
29-12-2017T18:45:45,Rosscoe,I wouldnt mind getting another monitor like i have for my work station
29-12-2017T18:45:52,ZRO4825,It has 2.
29-12-2017T18:45:58,Bgrmystr2,do you need more than two?
29-12-2017T18:46:01,ZRO4825,Yes.
29-12-2017T18:46:06,Bgrmystr2,I see
29-12-2017T18:46:14,ZRO4825,3 Consoles and a PC.
29-12-2017T18:46:16,Bgrmystr2,I just unplug / replug myself
29-12-2017T18:46:19,Bgrmystr2,I don't use switches
29-12-2017T18:46:43,Bgrmystr2,just use the same cable for the tv and swap the cable to whatever console you're using
29-12-2017T18:46:45,Bgrmystr2,easy :u
29-12-2017T18:46:47,KuroganeWatanoshi,wait. He was live again?
29-12-2017T18:46:54,Bgrmystr2,"who, Kuro?"
29-12-2017T18:47:00,KuroganeWatanoshi,Twokinds
29-12-2017T18:47:03,Bgrmystr2,No
29-12-2017T18:47:08,KuroganeWatanoshi,oh
29-12-2017T18:47:11,Bgrmystr2,Sage is live right now
29-12-2017T18:47:14,ZRO4825,"Too much of a pain in the ass, I'd have to remove everything from in front of the TV in order to move it to change the cable on the back of it. Trying to change out the cable to each console would be even worse."
29-12-2017T18:47:18,Bgrmystr2,they're still in the multi-stream
29-12-2017T18:47:19,KuroganeWatanoshi,oh
29-12-2017T18:47:33,Bgrmystr2,Tom doesn't usually stream on Saturdays.
29-12-2017T18:47:51,Bgrmystr2,Yeah Zro you really need to replace your desk thing then
29-12-2017T18:48:00,Bgrmystr2,cuz that's just more trouble than it's worth
29-12-2017T18:48:09,ZRO4825,That's why the switch. The switch isn't trouble at all.
29-12-2017T18:48:19,ZRO4825,"Except the thing with the text, but that's why I have a monitor for the PC."
29-12-2017T18:48:25,Bgrmystr2,"if you don't have quick access to the hardlines behind your actual devices, then there's a problem."
29-12-2017T18:48:35,Bgrmystr2,switch is just a crutch :P
29-12-2017T18:48:38,ZRO4825,Um...why is that a problem?
29-12-2017T18:48:47,Bgrmystr2,"useful crutch, to be fair"
29-12-2017T18:48:50,Bgrmystr2,but still
29-12-2017T18:48:58,ZRO4825,"Like, legit, why is that a problem? I don't need to swap the cables on consoles on a daily basis or anything, so I'm not sure why this is a problem?"
29-12-2017T18:49:16,SageSaga,lol Picarto tweeted in reply to something i said
29-12-2017T18:49:22,ZRO4825,"Hell, with this setup, I NEVER need to get to the cables unless something completely borks. o_O;"
29-12-2017T18:49:26,ZRO4825,"lol, nice Sage"
29-12-2017T18:49:49,Nekonny,oh?
29-12-2017T18:49:56,Nekonny,what did you say?
29-12-2017T18:50:07,Bgrmystr2,"Lol zro, if you don't have easy access to cables, then the very concept of having to re-wire things is a problem. Even if you don'"
29-12-2017T18:50:13,Bgrmystr2,don't do it that often.*
29-12-2017T18:50:17,Bgrmystr2,hate apostrophe
29-12-2017T18:50:48,ZRO4825,I can get to them well enough in the case that I need to.
29-12-2017T18:50:54,ZRO4825,It's not THAT difficult to get to them.
29-12-2017T18:51:08,Bgrmystr2,difficult enough that you would rather a switch?
29-12-2017T18:51:12,ZRO4825,"Oh, and I was wrong. It's 4 consoles. Forgot, PS3. :joy:"
29-12-2017T18:51:17,SageSaga,some person wanted me to stop using Picarto and start using twitch
29-12-2017T18:51:31,ZRO4825,why on earth would you want to do that? O_o
29-12-2017T18:51:34,Rosscoe,eeeh???
29-12-2017T18:51:46,Rosscoe,I take it the guy doesnt like Picarto XD
29-12-2017T18:51:51,SageSaga,https://twitter.com/Sagesaga/status/947253621254651905
29-12-2017T18:51:59,ZRO4825,"And Bgr, as often as I switch consoles I'm playing, switch is worth it, period. It's not worth the hassle of swapping cables every 5 minutes with how my ADHD gets with games at times."
29-12-2017T18:52:39,ZRO4825,Kanna gif is on point &lt;3
29-12-2017T18:52:52,Rosscoe,I had no issue watching streams on my old phone XD
29-12-2017T18:53:03,Rosscoe,couldnt text on it but you could watch
29-12-2017T18:53:05,SageSaga,i had no issues with my phone either
29-12-2017T18:53:15,ZRO4825,Mine does
29-12-2017T18:53:21,Rosscoe,Some people are just overly picky I guess
29-12-2017T18:53:35,ZRO4825,"No Ross, concerns with the Picarto app are legit."
29-12-2017T18:53:39,Bgrmystr2,"lol zro, that very statement is why your cable switch is a crutch. :u"
29-12-2017T18:53:40,SageSaga,"nah its a legit issue but im like ""watch on your PC then"""
29-12-2017T18:53:55,ZRO4825,Why is that a crutch??
29-12-2017T18:54:08,Nekonny,Nice reply there sage XD
29-12-2017T18:54:21,Nekonny,"Oh, did your net issues sort themselves out?"
29-12-2017T18:54:22,Rosscoe,"Twitch on the other hand I fouind has gone down the drain, only time I will watch a twitch stream if its linked to my phone or discord other wise nothing works and video feed is rubbish off the site itself XD"
29-12-2017T18:54:32,Bgrmystr2,Because you're using it to make up for not making the primary problem go away.
29-12-2017T18:54:35,SageSaga,kinda but we need a tech out here to look for the issue
29-12-2017T18:54:38,ZRO4825,It's not a damned problem
29-12-2017T18:54:42,Nekonny,I ve seen some people stream to both at the same time
29-12-2017T18:54:56,SageSaga,its an intermittent signal issue so its a physical problem somewhere
29-12-2017T18:55:03,SageSaga,probably an area with water in it
29-12-2017T18:55:23,ZRO4825,"Anyway, Picarto's app is an issue. I only get a working stream on it around 20% of the time, regardless of my connection speeds and such."
29-12-2017T18:55:24,Bgrmystr2,"I can understand why the guy doesn't like the picarto app. though, I hear a lot of people have problems with it"
29-12-2017T18:55:39,SageSaga,Zro- ignore Bgr hes not making much sense atm
29-12-2017T18:55:57,ZRO4825,"Nah, we're friends, we argue like this all the time. He just thinks everything is a problem even when it's a non-issue."
29-12-2017T18:56:12,SageSaga,nothing wrong with using an HDMI switch
29-12-2017T18:56:20,SageSaga,HDMI switch bro
29-12-2017T18:56:31,SageSaga,come on- we must clap hands now
29-12-2017T18:56:37,Bgrmystr2,"Hey, Just cuz I can see it :v"
29-12-2017T18:56:44,ZRO4825,It's a tool. Humans are where we are on the food chain because we learned to use tools.
29-12-2017T18:56:53,ZRO4825,"You're not ""seeing"" a problem, you're ""creating"" a problem."
29-12-2017T18:56:56,SageSaga,i said clap the hands
29-12-2017T18:57:12,ZRO4825,"Not understanding reference, Sage o_O"
29-12-2017T18:57:12,SageSaga,CLAP HANDS
29-12-2017T18:57:32,Bgrmystr2,"Naw, it's already there. I'm just good at identifying things. Have your handclap Sage lol :pray:"
29-12-2017T18:57:35,Rosscoe,claps his hands half hardedly
29-12-2017T18:57:55,SageSaga,noooo i dont wanna clap hands with mystery burger!
29-12-2017T18:57:56,Rosscoe,"oh your talking about the picarto app, I was talking aout picarto over the wbebsorwer on my phone XD"
29-12-2017T18:58:37,Bgrmystr2,"it's ok, I never wanted to enjoy a sega anyway :v"
29-12-2017T18:58:50,ZRO4825,I quite enjoyed my Dreamcast.
29-12-2017T18:59:41,Rosscoe,Dreamcast brough the consoles wars to the next levelm tobad it didnt live long
29-12-2017T19:00:02,ZRO4825,Yeah :(
29-12-2017T19:00:30,SageSaga,lol brought the console wars to a new level- the first actual murder of a console XD
29-12-2017T19:00:51,Rosscoe,XD
29-12-2017T19:01:43,BadFoMo,It died for its war crimes?
29-12-2017T19:02:45,Rosscoe,Now I am wondering something.
29-12-2017T19:03:06,Rosscoe,What if you wanted to set your channel up so its both for art and game streams? Your only allowed to set one catagory option
29-12-2017T19:03:20,Rosscoe,on picarto that is
29-12-2017T19:03:34,ZRO4825,"Yeah, but you can change it"
29-12-2017T19:04:37,ZRO4825,Holy crap. Toyoko's black dress date with Shiden was back in 2010? That...doesn't feel right.
29-12-2017T19:05:10,SageSaga,SEVEN YEARS AGO GOING ON EIGHT
29-12-2017T19:05:54,ZRO4825,"Yeah, that was right at the end of 2010"
29-12-2017T19:06:02,ZRO4825,"WHERE DID THE TIME GO, SAGE? @.@"
29-12-2017T19:06:40,SageSaga,I DONT KNOW
29-12-2017T19:06:48,SageSaga,I WANT IT BACK!
29-12-2017T19:07:17,SageSaga,wait- actually i might know
29-12-2017T19:07:50,ZRO4825,"Also, I &lt;3 that sparkle effect. While I was going through the archive to find the black dress, I saw the Serena bathing suit again and was like ""We need more of this."" :rofl:"
29-12-2017T19:08:50,SageSaga,Mister Mind
29-12-2017T19:09:36,SageSaga,Mister Mind eats time and space- he could be the cause
29-12-2017T19:09:51,Rosscoe,Looks like a Zergling to me
29-12-2017T19:09:57,Rosscoe,or a new type of Tryanid XD
29-12-2017T19:10:10,SageSaga,thankfully the greatest super hero of all time saved us- you all know who he is right?
29-12-2017T19:10:10,ZRO4825,lol
29-12-2017T19:10:19,ZRO4825,Booster Gold? :thinking:
29-12-2017T19:10:21,Nekonny,Squiel girl?
29-12-2017T19:10:27,Rosscoe,Space Dandy?
29-12-2017T19:10:33,ZRO4825,The Dovahkiin?
29-12-2017T19:10:44,SageSaga,dang straight its BOOSTER GOLD
29-12-2017T19:10:49,ZRO4825,:joy:
29-12-2017T19:10:51,Nekonny,That face
29-12-2017T19:11:01,SageSaga,GREATEST SUPER HERO EVER
29-12-2017T19:11:18,Nekonny,thanks flash
29-12-2017T19:11:31,Nekonny,or was it green latern?
29-12-2017T19:13:14,ZRO4825,Why would someone mistake him for GL? :rofl:
29-12-2017T19:13:25,BadFoMo,//Troll I thought the greatist super hero of all time was Brownstreak Man.
29-12-2017T19:14:03,SageSaga,perhaps because of his ring? Which he totally didnt steal from a museum
29-12-2017T19:14:39,TheBeckoner,Im back :smile:
29-12-2017T19:14:45,DevlNuK,"hello people, good evening!"
29-12-2017T19:14:49,Nekonny,what does his ring do?
29-12-2017T19:14:51,TheBeckoner,Hey devl
29-12-2017T19:15:45,SageSaga,it lets him fly
29-12-2017T19:16:21,TheBeckoner,And I was really just thinking of going to 2k and not 4k. 4k seems a bit much and tbh I cant tell the difference between the two on fo4
29-12-2017T19:17:21,ZRO4825,"If it's not on a bigger screen, I can't tell the dif between 1080p and 4k"
29-12-2017T19:17:35,ZRO4825,It's like people saying FLAC is SO much better than MP3s. I can't hear it.
29-12-2017T19:17:44,ZRO4825,"I'm sure some people can, but I can't, lol"
29-12-2017T19:18:56,TheBeckoner,"I can tell a small difference as far as audio qualities go. and yeah I have a 21"" or something right now, but a bigger 2k monitor would be nice"
29-12-2017T19:20:00,ZRO4825,"Yeah, mine's a 21.5"" monitor. Damned nice for 1080p, but that's also its limit, lol"
29-12-2017T19:20:34,TheBeckoner,Yeah lol mine is 1080p max at 59.9hz lol
29-12-2017T19:21:38,ZRO4825,60hz myself. Don't understand why they're not just ALL the same hz. What's the point in making different ones? lol
29-12-2017T19:23:25,TheBeckoner,There is probably a hardware challenge/cost the higher the frequency
29-12-2017T19:24:15,TheBeckoner,I'd like to get a 120fps or a 144fps monitor...Just to make sure this 1080ti is getting somewhat of a workout lol
29-12-2017T19:24:26,SageSaga,my monitor is a 144hz monitor
29-12-2017T19:24:53,TheBeckoner,What gpu do you have again? 970?
29-12-2017T19:25:03,DevlNuK,1070
29-12-2017T19:25:13,SageSaga,if you only have a 60hz monitor theres not much reason to try to get more than 60fps
29-12-2017T19:25:27,Bgrmystr2,"FLAC audio is lossless. It's something you need high quality audio equipment to hear the difference on. And usually MP3s can have such a high quality that unless you have studio equipment, you still won't hear a difference."
29-12-2017T19:25:36,TheBeckoner,"Which is why I'd like a new monitor, that and better resolution"
29-12-2017T19:25:38,Bgrmystr2,interference plays a major part.
29-12-2017T19:25:56,Bgrmystr2,I still haven't used a 144hz display myself
29-12-2017T19:26:07,Bgrmystr2,all the displays I've ever used are 60hz
29-12-2017T19:26:19,TheBeckoner,Same
29-12-2017T19:26:40,TheBeckoner,"well mine is a 60hz, Ive used 120 and 144 before"
29-12-2017T19:26:49,TheBeckoner,very smooth witha good card
29-12-2017T19:27:06,Bgrmystr2,I wouldn't know
29-12-2017T19:27:11,Bgrmystr2,I don't think they have any around here
29-12-2017T19:27:27,ZRO4825,"Not sure I understand the point though. iirc, the human eye is only capable of noticing an actual difference up to around 60fps, anything beyond that and we're actually losing some of the frames ourselves."
29-12-2017T19:27:46,Bgrmystr2,that's not true
29-12-2017T19:27:47,ZRO4825,Some people can't notice a difference past something like 40fps for that matter iirc
29-12-2017T19:27:51,TheBeckoner,"Not losing, just not noticing."
29-12-2017T19:28:03,SageSaga,yeah hate to say it but Bgr is correct
29-12-2017T19:28:16,Bgrmystr2,we can see much higher than 60hz
29-12-2017T19:28:39,Bgrmystr2,"the eye is just more complex and it depends on where you're focusing and at what angle, etc etc"
29-12-2017T19:28:44,TheBeckoner,"True, which is why I said not noticing"
29-12-2017T19:28:46,SageSaga,the human eye can perceive much higher especially with focus and under stress or when certain chemicals are released in our brains
29-12-2017T19:29:00,TheBeckoner,Adrenaline my dudes
29-12-2017T19:29:04,Mihari,"We don't see frequency response, we see frames per second XD"
29-12-2017T19:29:05,TheBeckoner,and dopamine
29-12-2017T19:29:18,Mihari,"Well, okay that came out wrong"
29-12-2017T19:29:33,Bgrmystr2,XD human eye is webcam confirmed
29-12-2017T19:29:40,ZRO4825,Middle ground. Frequencies per second!
29-12-2017T19:29:44,TheBeckoner,lol
29-12-2017T19:29:56,TheBeckoner,s^-1
29-12-2017T19:29:59,TheBeckoner,right?
29-12-2017T19:30:03,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock: can we see radio waves now?
29-12-2017T19:30:05,SageSaga,the frequency though is how many times a monitor can refresh an image- so if you are seeing more than 60FPS but getting 140FPS you wont notice a different between 60FPS and 140 on a 50hz monitor
29-12-2017T19:30:16,Mihari,"The point is, you notice the difference between 40hz, 60hz, 120hz, 144hz, 240hz it's just night and day as you go higher, the smoothness and clearness is just that much better."
29-12-2017T19:30:24,SageSaga,60*hz
29-12-2017T19:30:37,TheBeckoner,But it only counts if the monitor can handle it
29-12-2017T19:30:41,ZRO4825,right
29-12-2017T19:31:05,Bgrmystr2,a 60hz won't actually show smoother framerate higher than what it's labeled as.
29-12-2017T19:31:09,SageSaga,so the only point to having more FPS than your refresh rate is to buffer
29-12-2017T19:31:26,TheBeckoner,"Lol before I set the frame cap on fo4 I was getting 2400fps with this 108ti, unfortunately it sped the game itself up and messed stuff up"
29-12-2017T19:31:28,SageSaga,so when you have frame drops yo wont notice
29-12-2017T19:31:40,Mihari,"Yah, also why a lot of people cap their games framerates at 60 fps."
29-12-2017T19:32:09,TheBeckoner,I capped it at 120 just to keep everything constatly above 60 just so I didnt notice any drops
29-12-2017T19:32:37,Rosscoe,"I set Vsync on just about all my games, saves on heating and power and what yoiu hadBeckoner XD"
29-12-2017T19:32:44,Mihari,"Hehe, kinda backwards thinking XD"
29-12-2017T19:33:10,ZRO4825,:thinking: I think I just found my January sketch request.
29-12-2017T19:33:13,TheBeckoner,I used fast Vsync because normal vsync was knockin me down to 40fps
29-12-2017T19:33:17,Mihari,"If you computer can constantly exceed 60, why set it higher than 60 to avoid drops XD"
29-12-2017T19:33:25,TheBeckoner,lol why not
29-12-2017T19:33:29,TheBeckoner,I wanna be cool too
29-12-2017T19:33:56,TheBeckoner,But really Im just getting ready for a new monitor
29-12-2017T19:34:00,Bgrmystr2,"that's not what vsync is for, Beck"
29-12-2017T19:34:05,SageSaga,actually thats something ive been curious about- if you cap at 60 and something happens that would make it drop- does it still drop?
29-12-2017T19:34:07,TheBeckoner,I know
29-12-2017T19:34:09,Bgrmystr2,that's contrary to what it's designed for XD
29-12-2017T19:34:13,TheBeckoner,Its for tearing
29-12-2017T19:34:16,SageSaga,since its capable of putting out more than that-
29-12-2017T19:34:21,Mihari,It only drops if it can't maintain the 60
29-12-2017T19:34:39,Mihari,It will never fall below 60 unless it can't maintain it
29-12-2017T19:34:48,TheBeckoner,However different  types of vsync can handle tearing differently
29-12-2017T19:35:07,TheBeckoner,Fast vsync handles it better for my setup I guess
29-12-2017T19:35:17,Mihari,g-sync! :D
29-12-2017T19:35:19,sunblaze,sleepy.....
29-12-2017T19:35:23,SageSaga,because ive noticed drops in Overwatch from time to time- running it at 200FPS when i have a 144 hz monitor- and the drop didnt take it under 144-
29-12-2017T19:35:25,sunblaze,bye time fo bed
29-12-2017T19:35:34,SageSaga,sleep well Sunblaze thanks for joining!
29-12-2017T19:35:37,TheBeckoner,See yah Sun
29-12-2017T19:35:47,FoxxTrotter,"G'night, Sunblaze."
29-12-2017T19:35:58,SageSaga,Zro- whats your next request?
29-12-2017T19:36:08,ZRO4825,Revisit Toyoko's black dress! =D
29-12-2017T19:36:27,TheBeckoner,Lol this 6 year old monitor doesnt support g-sync
29-12-2017T19:36:31,Mihari,Well it just means you can't always maintain that high
29-12-2017T19:36:56,SageSaga,but why would i notice the drops in game?
29-12-2017T19:37:16,TheBeckoner,Youre magic thats why
29-12-2017T19:37:19,TheBeckoner,i dunno
29-12-2017T19:37:46,ZRO4825,Sounds like perhaps CPU/RAM bottlenecking for a moment as opposed to GPU?
29-12-2017T19:39:08,Bgrmystr2,SSD maybe?
29-12-2017T19:39:11,Bgrmystr2,cable bottleneck?
29-12-2017T19:39:15,Bgrmystr2,even network bottleneck
29-12-2017T19:39:27,Bgrmystr2,many variables
29-12-2017T19:39:36,TheBeckoner,Could be a high ping momentarily
29-12-2017T19:39:43,Bgrmystr2,"When I played Diablo 3, I would sometimes have the screen stop and go, while the FPS never changed"
29-12-2017T19:39:45,Mihari,Depends on how big the drop is
29-12-2017T19:40:01,Rosscoe,There is also the thing to remember the game engine your using too
29-12-2017T19:40:03,Bgrmystr2,"it was the network connection to the blizzard servers that dropped, usually"
29-12-2017T19:40:30,Bgrmystr2,the game engine also has to be able to handle displaying things
29-12-2017T19:40:49,Mihari,"Think of it as a video, if you're watching something at 4K UHD then suddenly it buffers down to 720P for just a moment because network issues, it's gonna be a jarring moment XD"
29-12-2017T19:41:17,Bgrmystr2,Exactly
29-12-2017T19:41:19,ZRO4825,Yar
29-12-2017T19:41:28,Bgrmystr2,and it's not like your wouldn't handle the 4k
29-12-2017T19:41:44,Bgrmystr2,other things can also affect what you see.
29-12-2017T19:41:47,Mihari,"That's why you should cap at 60, and run at the fast refresh possible for your monitor"
29-12-2017T19:41:48,Bgrmystr2,your rig*
29-12-2017T19:42:03,Mihari,60 is easy to maintain on newer and high end machines
29-12-2017T19:42:45,SageSaga,why not cap at 144 since thats the monitors refresh rate?
29-12-2017T19:43:04,Mihari,cause you can't reliably and constantly do 144 FPS
29-12-2017T19:43:24,SageSaga,seems to- it runs at 244 regularly
29-12-2017T19:43:36,Mihari,The key word is constantly
29-12-2017T19:43:53,SageSaga,and did a drop of 40-50 so it was still over what should be visible
29-12-2017T19:44:13,Bgrmystr2,I'm not sure if switching to 60hz will change anything. The outside sources that affect the 144hz signal will affect the 60hz signal as well.
29-12-2017T19:44:20,Mihari,Keep in mind this...
29-12-2017T19:44:47,ZRO4825,"FPS display is an average of however many fractions of a second though, isn't it?"
29-12-2017T19:44:49,Mihari,"If your system flat out stalled or stuttered thats something else, it does cause a HUGE dip in FPS because it's just that, frames per second, you'll notice a massive stop all of a sudden, period."
29-12-2017T19:45:08,Bgrmystr2,&lt;3 this song
29-12-2017T19:48:58,TheBeckoner,Whats the most amount of hours y'all have put into a  game?
29-12-2017T19:49:30,ZRO4825,Too many.
29-12-2017T19:49:40,TheBeckoner,I personally have 4142 in Besiege
29-12-2017T19:49:44,SageSaga,i have over 900 hours into MH4U and MHGen
29-12-2017T19:49:49,TheBeckoner,Too many isnt enough
29-12-2017T19:50:06,Bgrmystr2,"Beck, you don't wanna know"
29-12-2017T19:50:09,ZRO4825,"Most of my gaming hours were done before we had any way to track how many hours we put into them, lol"
29-12-2017T19:50:11,TheBeckoner,I havent ever played any of the MH games
29-12-2017T19:50:26,Bgrmystr2,I played an MMO nearly every single day almost all day for about 10 years and a couple months.
29-12-2017T19:50:32,Bgrmystr2,I don't have timestamps on that
29-12-2017T19:50:37,TheBeckoner,"Thats fair, I probably have a ton of hours on the N64"
29-12-2017T19:50:40,Bgrmystr2,but I do have games with over 4000+ hours
29-12-2017T19:50:41,Rosscoe,I wantto live stream MHW
29-12-2017T19:50:52,Rosscoe,With people of course cause alone sucks
29-12-2017T19:51:00,ZRO4825,I know for a fact I've got somewhere near or in excess of 10k hour put into FFXI.
29-12-2017T19:51:04,SageSaga,PEACE GUYS!

29-12-2017T19:51:49,Rosscoe,I stopped with the consoles after getting computer and seeing how muhc interesting PCs are over a console
29-12-2017T19:51:54,TheBeckoner,"Well I think Im gonna get it, we could play if you wanted. Ive never played before but yeah lol"
29-12-2017T19:51:58,Bgrmystr2,"played for a long, long time."
29-12-2017T19:52:12,Bgrmystr2,I put even more time into D2 honestly

29-12-2017T19:53:27,Bgrmystr2,the cuteness of early game is charming
29-12-2017T19:53:32,TheBeckoner,Thats why I stopped playing Wot
29-12-2017T19:53:43,Rosscoe,Well im off to tinkering with my picarto account
