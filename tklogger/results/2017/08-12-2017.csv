08-12-2017T00:07:09,unsteddyphoenix,Send me the thing if you can be bothered~
08-12-2017T00:07:14,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
08-12-2017T00:07:17,TLDragon,"so, Twokinds was the featured stream when I decided to check who was on. :)"
08-12-2017T00:07:18,CrRAR,I think it depends on whose stream he joined how the sub icon shows up.
08-12-2017T00:07:23,Tharkis,thanks for the stream nero !
08-12-2017T00:07:31,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"See ya Neon, love ya"
08-12-2017T00:07:33,TLDragon,"First time catching one of the streams, though not new to the comic. ^^"
08-12-2017T00:07:34,TheBeckoner,makes sense
08-12-2017T00:07:45,Nekonny,Welcome!
08-12-2017T00:07:59,neropan,welcom
08-12-2017T00:08:03,Combak,"@TLDragon, it normally is on Friday. Too many people here. :p Welcome to the stream!"
08-12-2017T00:08:05,SageSaga,they dont do Featured as much anymore it seems - just most watched that is SFW
08-12-2017T00:08:17,CrRAR,hmm
08-12-2017T00:08:21,funnyman42,Should I make cinnamon rolls tonight or wait untill tomarrow?
08-12-2017T00:08:26,CrRAR,RIGHT NOW
08-12-2017T00:08:27,TheBeckoner,make them now
08-12-2017T00:08:31,CrRAR,^^^^^
08-12-2017T00:08:32,Ordithus,And send them my way.
08-12-2017T00:08:34,CrRAR,NAOW
08-12-2017T00:08:38,SageSaga,Tomorrow
08-12-2017T00:08:39,TheBeckoner,DO ET
08-12-2017T00:08:44,Combak,"That's how I'd set it up, tbh."
08-12-2017T00:08:45,iZute,jesus xD
08-12-2017T00:08:45,TLDragon,"well, whatever they do, Sage, I loaded up picarto and there was Two Kinds, big as life and twice as fuzzy. :)"
08-12-2017T00:09:13,SageSaga,yeah- and i was one of those squares next to it
08-12-2017T00:09:24,TheBeckoner,lol
08-12-2017T00:09:28,Tharkis,"@sagesaga from what i understand 'featured' requires a picarto employee/mod to notice your stream and afix it there, where front page is just an algorithm combining time spent streaming and number of viewers"
08-12-2017T00:09:36,TLDragon,"given the multistream, that's not surprising"
08-12-2017T00:09:43,SageSaga,i believe that is correct Tharkis
08-12-2017T00:09:55,Whitestripes,Im back
08-12-2017T00:09:58,Combak,Actually Sage... :p
08-12-2017T00:10:00,CrRAR,wb
08-12-2017T00:10:08,unsteddyphoenix,So they physically have to feature it?
08-12-2017T00:10:11,TLDragon,Tharkis? That name seems familiar
08-12-2017T00:10:13,unsteddyphoenix,Its not automatic?
08-12-2017T00:10:26,SageSaga,for it to be actually Featured
08-12-2017T00:10:27,SageSaga,yes
08-12-2017T00:10:40,SageSaga,when it is featured there is a Star on it saying Featured
08-12-2017T00:10:42,TLDragon,"my memory may be failing, but... did you ever play Everquest, Tharkis?"
08-12-2017T00:10:43,unsteddyphoenix,Huh. TIL.
08-12-2017T00:10:45,Combak,"Teddy, it's manually. :p"
08-12-2017T00:10:49,Tharkis,"yes TLDragon, still do"
08-12-2017T00:11:01,TLDragon,"oooh, the pretty kitty princess shaman! :)"
08-12-2017T00:11:16,Tharkis,"bah!  i'm not a princess, and i wasnt always a kitty either"
08-12-2017T00:11:23,Tharkis,i was a barbarian guy till the devs turned me into a catgirl
08-12-2017T00:11:32,TLDragon,and yet...
08-12-2017T00:11:33,Combak,... Why?
08-12-2017T00:11:44,unsteddyphoenix,:thinking:
08-12-2017T00:11:54,Ordithus,So... you became a pretty princess?
08-12-2017T00:11:55,Tharkis,"but i still play, in fact next tuesday a new expansion comes out"
08-12-2017T00:12:02,SageSaga,because the Devs are benevolent?
08-12-2017T00:12:04,Tharkis,do i look like a pretty kitty princess to you?
08-12-2017T00:12:11,Ordithus,Maybe?
08-12-2017T00:12:18,CrRAR,perhaps
08-12-2017T00:12:23,TLDragon,"we never grouped up, different servers, but I saw you a bunch of times on the betatest servers, and you were definitely a kitty princess there. :)"
08-12-2017T00:12:30,CrRAR,yaaay
08-12-2017T00:12:40,Tharkis,that's because the devs are evil and made a script on old man thorren
08-12-2017T00:12:49,Tharkis,so anyone who says 'princess' to old man will turn me into a catgirl
08-12-2017T00:13:10,unsteddyphoenix,Convoluted...
08-12-2017T00:13:17,ZRO4825,Wait....Everquest has ANOTHER expansion coming out? Isn't it on like....the 29th or some crap? o.o;
08-12-2017T00:13:17,Tharkis,"in fact, ijus ttabbe dover to beta server, and someone's turned me into  a catgirl again"
08-12-2017T00:13:31,Whitestripes,Alright. Thanks for the stream. I'm off to bed. Bye bye
08-12-2017T00:13:41,iZute,see ya man
08-12-2017T00:13:46,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nighty night Stripes

08-12-2017T00:13:48,FoxxTrotter,"G'night, Whitestripes."
08-12-2017T00:13:58,TheBeckoner,goodnight White
08-12-2017T00:14:15,Tharkis,"24th expansion, ZRO"
08-12-2017T00:14:25,ZRO4825,"Okay, so I'm a little off on my count, still, wtf :joy:"
08-12-2017T00:14:33,unsteddyphoenix,Wait.
08-12-2017T00:14:37,unsteddyphoenix,Everquest still exists?
08-12-2017T00:14:44,ZRO4825,IKR? XD
08-12-2017T00:14:51,TLDragon,"it's been going since 1999, though I drifted away in Veil"
08-12-2017T00:14:57,unsteddyphoenix,What the hell~ How
08-12-2017T00:15:02,Tharkis,still fun too !
08-12-2017T00:15:07,TheBeckoner,dang its old
08-12-2017T00:15:09,ZizzoGaming,"Ok, I'm back. I've calculated the fire to be ~9.5 miles away. It's up to 15% containment, this morning it was 0% contained"
08-12-2017T00:15:12,unsteddyphoenix,That might have the oldest playerbase of any videogame
08-12-2017T00:15:16,TLDragon,did the lore ever improve after Veil?
08-12-2017T00:15:17,ZRO4825,"One of the very few games running longer than one of the MMOs I still play on occasion, that being Final Fantasy XI, lol"
08-12-2017T00:15:42,TheBeckoner,Hey zizzo. Thats good right?
08-12-2017T00:15:42,Ordithus,wb zizzo
08-12-2017T00:15:43,CrRAR,Still sounds a lil scary.
08-12-2017T00:15:55,TLDragon,"I thought SE was going to close down XI, or did that get put off?"
08-12-2017T00:16:22,ZizzoGaming,"It's good, but still scary. Yesterday we had ash blowing around our campus."
08-12-2017T00:16:34,CrRAR,wow
08-12-2017T00:16:41,CrRAR,sounds apocalyptic
08-12-2017T00:16:47,ZizzoGaming,Pretty much
08-12-2017T00:16:52,TLDragon,"15% contained is good, by the time you get to 50% or so, it's basically controlled"
08-12-2017T00:16:52,MarvTheHugPharaoh,PINK!!!!! \o/
08-12-2017T00:16:58,CrRAR,ooooOOoo
08-12-2017T00:16:59,TheBeckoner,man thats gotta be unnerving to see
08-12-2017T00:17:06,Bgrmystr2,"Zizzo, some of the fires in Cali are blowing smoke several miles into the pacific"
08-12-2017T00:17:06,Tharkis,surprised someone recognized me here &gt;_&lt;
08-12-2017T00:17:09,CrRAR,ic ic
08-12-2017T00:17:12,Bgrmystr2,from NASA pictures
08-12-2017T00:17:14,ZRO4825,"They never closed it TL, they did however put out its final questline, and the server's are basically now just being updated once a month to change the Ambuscade fights, other than that, nothing really huge and new on it anymore"
08-12-2017T00:17:15,Bgrmystr2,so yeah it's not surprising
08-12-2017T00:17:22,TLDragon,"I'm surprised, too, Tharkis. Small world. :)"
08-12-2017T00:17:24,CrRAR,Oh nice color blue.
08-12-2017T00:17:36,ZRO4825,"Wait, Tharkis, your actual character gets turned into a catgirl, or some NPC that they named after you? :o"
08-12-2017T00:17:37,ZizzoGaming,"Oh yeah, the Thomas Fire has reached the friggin ocean, so I'm not suprised"
08-12-2017T00:17:39,CrRAR,sweet sweet purp
08-12-2017T00:18:01,unsteddyphoenix,Woah you guys have started naming the fires?
08-12-2017T00:18:02,TLDragon,"With the server mergers, my character might be on your server, though. I was on Nameless server, still have my character for that matter."
08-12-2017T00:18:06,ZRO4825,"I wish to see this suddenly catgirl in action, lol"

08-12-2017T01:27:10,rawrimawolf,with dedication?
08-12-2017T01:27:15,TheBeckoner,Case mod and backlight mod along with audio mods
08-12-2017T01:27:28,unsteddyphoenix,...you modded a backlight on.
08-12-2017T01:27:30,SageSaga,and the magnifying glass
08-12-2017T01:27:34,TheBeckoner,makes it wayyyyyyy more useable
08-12-2017T01:27:45,TheBeckoner,the backlight is the best first mod to do imo
08-12-2017T01:27:56,SageSaga,http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/550/192/169.jpg
08-12-2017T01:28:10,TheBeckoner,lol I have those attachments
08-12-2017T01:28:13,Ordithus,haha sage
08-12-2017T01:28:17,unsteddyphoenix,Oh wow it's a thing
08-12-2017T01:28:23,Mihari,I had that.
08-12-2017T01:28:23,unsteddyphoenix,10 minute video tutorial. Huh.
08-12-2017T01:28:27,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
08-12-2017T01:28:34,TheBeckoner,but im talking about something different
08-12-2017T01:28:42,Mihari,Yah modding was a thing
08-12-2017T01:29:03,Mihari,I modded my xbox.
08-12-2017T01:29:06,unsteddyphoenix,When I think of modding I think of like...chipped PS2s
08-12-2017T01:29:06,Mihari,Almost modded my 3ds
08-12-2017T01:29:09,TheJashter,"Hey, I love this song"
08-12-2017T01:29:11,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah
08-12-2017T01:29:14,TheJashter,Cool game too
08-12-2017T01:29:20,unsteddyphoenix,Never thought of modding a gameboy lol.
08-12-2017T01:29:21,TheJashter,"Now, back to lurking"
08-12-2017T01:29:25,unsteddyphoenix,So pointless?
08-12-2017T01:29:38,TheBeckoner,a backlight is far from pointless
08-12-2017T01:29:55,Combak,It lets you play in the dark!
08-12-2017T01:30:00,TheBeckoner,Yea!
08-12-2017T01:30:07,iZute,UPDATE: (this is going to be a thing i do becuase i have some small amout of time to write these) First big load started! drying bros blanket because he is wanting it
08-12-2017T01:30:10,TheBeckoner,I also made a portable N64
08-12-2017T01:30:11,Ordithus,I had the thing that was a magnifying glass and a light
08-12-2017T01:30:25,unsteddyphoenix,Noone who owns a gameboy at this point has to play in the dark lol
08-12-2017T01:30:34,unsteddyphoenix,The 90's have already been
08-12-2017T01:30:37,iZute,im not even sure anyone is reading these
08-12-2017T01:30:41,BadFoMo,Then there was a Gameboy mod that would give you a little sleeping gas as you went through the game. ...It was a surgery thing.
08-12-2017T01:30:41,TheBeckoner,I am
08-12-2017T01:30:42,rawrimawolf,what if I live in a cave
08-12-2017T01:30:47,iZute,oh
08-12-2017T01:30:51,ZizzoGaming,i am
08-12-2017T01:30:52,unsteddyphoenix,Im defintely not reading them on purpose
08-12-2017T01:30:56,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"who provides you internet, wolf"
08-12-2017T01:30:57,TheBeckoner,lol
08-12-2017T01:31:03,iZute,XD thanks
08-12-2017T01:31:17,unsteddyphoenix,Talk about icecream or something instead
08-12-2017T01:31:19,rawrimawolf,my cave is directly underneath the Verizon building
08-12-2017T01:31:25,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
08-12-2017T01:31:35,rawrimawolf,I duct taped a few potatoes to my toaster
08-12-2017T01:31:39,rawrimawolf,and tada
08-12-2017T01:31:40,unsteddyphoenix,Ahh. So you work for them then.
08-12-2017T01:31:53,rawrimawolf,:ptv-condescending:
08-12-2017T01:31:53,unsteddyphoenix,Heard the conditions were bad but...
08-12-2017T01:32:07,Ordithus,Saria is pretty darn cute as a lioness
08-12-2017T01:32:09,rawrimawolf,they'll sometimes throw me a loaf of moldy bread
08-12-2017T01:32:10,TheBeckoner,hey Tom it looks good :grin:
08-12-2017T01:32:35,Twokinds,Thanks!
08-12-2017T01:32:39,BadFoMo,@unsteddyphoenix Ice Cream? Uh... Remember thoes butterscotch Klondiks?
08-12-2017T01:32:39,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"just want to point out, that is one super clean mirror"
08-12-2017T01:32:42,SageSaga,you would need over 200 potatoes to power a toaster
08-12-2017T01:32:44,ZizzoGaming,Looks great
08-12-2017T01:32:48,iZute,tom is done?
08-12-2017T01:32:55,iZute,Its awesome man!
08-12-2017T01:32:56,TheBeckoner,7/10 Mirror too clean
08-12-2017T01:32:57,rawrimawolf,"Sage, I stocked up"
08-12-2017T01:32:58,Bgrmystr2,"""A few"" needs 200 xD"
08-12-2017T01:33:18,rawrimawolf,never question the amount of potatoes I have in my kitchen
08-12-2017T01:33:21,unsteddyphoenix,Magic mirror?
08-12-2017T01:33:24,HeresyArtStream,Some smudges on the edges of the mirror would make it look more antique.
08-12-2017T01:33:32,HeresyArtStream,The edges would be the part that gets cleaned the least.
08-12-2017T01:33:35,TheBeckoner,You'd also have to account for voltage drop
08-12-2017T01:33:54,TheBeckoner,in the potatoes
08-12-2017T01:33:55,SageSaga,sorry - my math was off
08-12-2017T01:33:57,iZute,i dont think he has the time/wants to add smudges XD
08-12-2017T01:34:07,HeresyArtStream,"Regardless, it's beautiful! &lt;3"
08-12-2017T01:34:10,iZute,be too much work
08-12-2017T01:34:13,TheBeckoner,I was joking with the 7/10
08-12-2017T01:34:22,SageSaga,"its closer to 2,000,000"
08-12-2017T01:34:26,TheBeckoner,really a 10/10 like most everything you do
08-12-2017T01:34:31,Tharkis,doodles a smudged paw print on the corner of the mirror to appease thebeckoner
08-12-2017T01:34:37,iZute,Mhm! to cool for school good
08-12-2017T01:34:37,TheBeckoner,thats probably closer

08-12-2017T01:35:00,TheBeckoner,how long would it take to get 2 million potatoes...
08-12-2017T01:35:04,unsteddyphoenix,Eh basically the same number sage
08-12-2017T01:35:20,rawrimawolf,how many laws am I allowed to break
08-12-2017T01:35:22,Ordithus,"If you're growing them, I'd say a few months."
08-12-2017T01:35:27,Ordithus,And a lot of land.
08-12-2017T01:35:34,rawrimawolf,huge tracts?
08-12-2017T01:35:34,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"7, habibi"

08-12-2017T02:13:05,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Sage VaatiVidya said that the new blood borne might be a new IP, if not that then it might take place in a Lovecraft like futile Japan"

08-12-2017T02:14:02,iZute,true true
08-12-2017T02:14:11,SageSaga,well the writing on the parchment certainly did look like an Asian script
08-12-2017T02:14:16,unsteddyphoenix,"Speaking of weebs, yall seen weebatman trailer?"
08-12-2017T02:14:19,iZute,i was gonna say humans but magic probably goes to them
08-12-2017T02:14:22,iZute,YES
08-12-2017T02:14:28,TheBeckoner,no?
08-12-2017T02:14:30,iZute,i did see the weebman trailer

08-12-2017T02:14:42,TheBeckoner,yes
08-12-2017T02:14:47,unsteddyphoenix,It so weird I dont know how to feel
08-12-2017T02:14:55,MarvTheHugPharaoh,and the music was also used Asian instruments
08-12-2017T02:14:57,iZute,I loved it
08-12-2017T02:15:26,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"that ""was"" was not needed"
08-12-2017T02:15:27,SageSaga,i didnt have the audio on
08-12-2017T02:15:57,MarvTheHugPharaoh,there were Taiko drums

08-12-2017T02:16:09,iZute,night man
08-12-2017T02:16:10,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nighty night Ord
08-12-2017T02:16:17,SageSaga,but you know its dumb when your teaser makes more sense than death strandings full trailer
08-12-2017T02:16:36,SageSaga,why was the baby in his stomach?!
08-12-2017T02:16:37,unsteddyphoenix,Anything makes more sense than that tailer
08-12-2017T02:16:56,unsteddyphoenix,"""What the hell is a metaphor and how does it work"" -Hideo Kojima, probably."
08-12-2017T02:17:12,iZute,true XD
08-12-2017T02:17:16,ZRO4825,"""Be quiet, don't breathe!"" In the meantime, detector thing is going CLACK CLACK CLACK CLACK CLACK!!"
08-12-2017T02:17:25,SageSaga,and that drunk guy with his game about the 2 guys who break out of prison
08-12-2017T02:17:46,ZRO4825,"omg that guy, lol, so much facepalm at hearing him"
08-12-2017T02:18:24,SageSaga,"""He's just passionate"" Translation - ""Hes drunk and wont be invited on stage ever again*"
08-12-2017T02:18:44,unsteddyphoenix,Was that the guy that wouldnt stop swearing?
08-12-2017T02:18:58,SageSaga,and flipping off the Camera and not talking about his game
08-12-2017T02:19:09,iZute,XD
08-12-2017T02:19:13,TheBeckoner,What are yall talking about now?
08-12-2017T02:19:25,unsteddyphoenix,lol
08-12-2017T02:19:31,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah that was...a thing
08-12-2017T02:19:31,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"not sure if drunk, or finally had permission to walk out side?"
08-12-2017T02:19:45,SageSaga,the game looks sweet- but he was rude
08-12-2017T02:20:13,SageSaga,the Game Awards from last night
08-12-2017T02:20:26,iZute,I just love seeing you guys rant XD
08-12-2017T02:20:55,MarvTheHugPharaoh,not really a rant
08-12-2017T02:21:29,TheBeckoner,Oh
08-12-2017T02:21:31,iZute,criticizing
08-12-2017T02:21:50,TheBeckoner,sharing observations
08-12-2017T02:23:16,SageSaga,crapping on other award shows is like putting people down to try and make yourself seem better- it doesnt work
08-12-2017T02:23:47,unsteddyphoenix,If it didnt work people wouldnt do it~
08-12-2017T02:24:39,SageSaga,people doing it thinks it works because they are venting- they dont realize how many people see them as more of a dick and get ousted eventually
08-12-2017T02:25:05,iZute,im watch a grown man bathe in potatos
08-12-2017T02:25:12,iZute,this is how i end my nights
08-12-2017T02:25:18,unsteddyphoenix,"Naw, depends on other factors too"
08-12-2017T02:25:29,unsteddyphoenix,"How hated the thing theyre roasting is, and how they say it."
08-12-2017T02:25:36,unsteddyphoenix,John Oliver is pretty popular~
08-12-2017T02:25:39,TheBeckoner,how zute? I wanna see
08-12-2017T02:26:28,SageSaga,im talking about a drunk man saying the Oscars are garbage and the Video Game awards are soooo cooooolll!!!!!
08-12-2017T02:26:42,iZute,this is the video
08-12-2017T02:26:43,SageSaga,and then proceeds to curse about the oscars over and over
08-12-2017T02:26:44,iZute,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cfofrCp12M
08-12-2017T02:26:49,TheBeckoner,but they are garbage
08-12-2017T02:26:51,unsteddyphoenix,Lel
08-12-2017T02:27:10,iZute,am i not allowed to post links or something?
08-12-2017T02:27:15,TheBeckoner,whisper it
08-12-2017T02:27:16,Bgrmystr2,Rules are hard to read :u
08-12-2017T02:27:20,SageSaga,no one is- its in the rules
08-12-2017T02:27:27,unsteddyphoenix,"Well ""putting people down to make yourself seem better"" sometimes works is what im saying"
08-12-2017T02:27:34,rawrimawolf,Nickelodeon's Kids Choice Awards is superior
08-12-2017T02:27:40,TheBeckoner,lol
08-12-2017T02:27:40,iZute,where are the rules? i havent been able to read them yet
08-12-2017T02:28:10,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"""General Rule - Ask first. Want to post a link? "" and say what the link is for"
08-12-2017T02:28:18,SageSaga,it doesnt - hurting people to feel better means you are either just venting -which can be done without harming others- or you are a sadist
08-12-2017T02:28:51,SageSaga,rules are at the bottom of the page
08-12-2017T02:28:57,iZute,???
08-12-2017T02:29:20,iZute,"in the ""description""?"
08-12-2017T02:29:30,SageSaga,yes
08-12-2017T02:29:31,iZute,because there is none for me
08-12-2017T02:29:44,MarvTheHugPharaoh,are you on toms page?
08-12-2017T02:30:03,iZute,mhm
08-12-2017T02:30:07,SageSaga,"Stream Rules!  General Rule - Ask first. Want to post a link? Check with me or another mod/streamer first. No promotions. Streamers in multi-streams can promote themselves and their works and things they want, -"
08-12-2017T02:30:18,SageSaga,but viewers should not promote anything without permission. Don't be rude. Puns are only tolerated :stuck_out_tongue:
08-12-2017T02:30:31,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: honestly picarto should really show the description of the host of the multistream
08-12-2017T02:30:37,SageSaga,they used to
08-12-2017T02:30:42,Bgrmystr2,or at least let the host choose
08-12-2017T02:30:49,iZute,just send a screenshot of the rules
08-12-2017T02:30:54,TheBeckoner,Yeah I couldnt find them either
08-12-2017T02:31:02,TheBeckoner,just whisper the link to whoever
08-12-2017T02:31:12,SageSaga,I just copied and pasted the entire rules
08-12-2017T02:31:15,Bgrmystr2,It's probably with the new change to how the UI functions
08-12-2017T02:31:27,iZute,oh
08-12-2017T02:33:11,Bgrmystr2,The rules for multi-streams are on sage's description
08-12-2017T02:33:30,Bgrmystr2,Which used to show for all streams during a multi-stream
08-12-2017T02:33:59,SageSaga,it also doesnt have my latest edit - i must have not saved it- but it was this-
08-12-2017T02:34:22,TheBeckoner,lol zute great vid
08-12-2017T02:34:33,iZute,XD
08-12-2017T02:34:49,SageSaga,You may post links so long as they are links to comics/artwork of current streamers and the links are directly to their official sites only
08-12-2017T02:35:24,iZute,oh its of markiplier batheing in a bathtub of mashed potatos

08-12-2017T03:09:17,w0lfmare,Suddenly remembering Sage's wisdom on obtaining exotic mounts in D&D
08-12-2017T03:09:42,SageSaga,Dont mount it if it's undead?
08-12-2017T03:09:57,w0lfmare,And imagining cat girl piggybacking that thing everywhere XD
08-12-2017T03:10:02,MarvTheHugPharaoh,well then
08-12-2017T03:10:05,SageSaga,thats on the list of things to remember when obtaining Exotic mounts
08-12-2017T03:10:37,Bgrmystr2,Thanks for streaming sage :D
08-12-2017T03:10:51,SageSaga,last thing you need is to mount an undead horse only for its bones to necrotize your flesh
08-12-2017T03:11:04,w0lfmare,"I was thinking of your ""just go for it"" when the giant wolf came up in an earlier stream"
08-12-2017T03:11:28,SageSaga,thats for creatures that it makes sense for
08-12-2017T03:11:42,w0lfmare,:cw0lfmare-KiaHalo:
08-12-2017T03:11:46,SageSaga,if Princess Mononoke can do it so can you!
08-12-2017T03:12:19,SageSaga,i was in a game where a guy mounted a giant snake and punched it to death
08-12-2017T03:13:05,w0lfmare,Not a bad plan
08-12-2017T03:13:22,w0lfmare,"Though, a waste of a pretty sweet mount"
08-12-2017T03:13:39,w0lfmare,Must have failed that animal handling roll
08-12-2017T03:14:06,SageSaga,yeah it wouldnt cooperate so he tried to punch it into submission but it's life gave out before its will
08-12-2017T03:16:16,w0lfmare,"By the way, I'll probably try to stream with you tomorrow, if weather permits. Do you multistream on Saturdays?"
08-12-2017T03:16:30,SageSaga,sure
08-12-2017T03:16:49,w0lfmare,Awesome

08-12-2017T15:34:50,TheBeckoner,"Weird, I would never pick a class on saturday"
08-12-2017T15:35:16,SageSaga,depends on the school
08-12-2017T15:35:54,SageSaga,some schools share rooms so for finals they may schedule them at different days to use certain rooms for the test
08-12-2017T15:38:12,eric190,"better to have a final on saturday, then to drag things out over another weekend."

08-12-2017T16:20:37,funnyman42,make an energy drink?
08-12-2017T16:20:53,TheBeckoner,"no, drink an energy drink"
08-12-2017T16:21:12,TheBeckoner,from the fridge
08-12-2017T16:21:18,funnyman42,oh..........
08-12-2017T16:21:25,funnyman42,that's much less interesting.
08-12-2017T16:21:36,FoxxTrotter,Wiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiings.
08-12-2017T16:21:45,TheBeckoner,Although making one would be interresting
08-12-2017T16:25:14,Kynum,just melt sugar and drink that. should have a similar effect...

08-12-2017T17:04:56,FoxxTrotter,:0)
08-12-2017T17:05:51,Kynum,I'll see you guys later.
08-12-2017T17:06:30,FoxxTrotter,"C-ya, Kynum."
08-12-2017T17:09:33,SageSaga,take care
08-12-2017T17:10:08,w0lfmare,See ya Kynum
08-12-2017T17:11:31,w0lfmare,So what do you think about the new fee changes on Patreon Sage?
08-12-2017T17:14:08,SageSaga,"i think its a great idea! if it was a freakn option =_= if they just had a check box when you pledge saying ""I would like to cover fees for my creator"" - i would be totally fine with it- what I cannot get behind is charging multiple transaction fees for"
08-12-2017T17:14:13,SageSaga,a SINGLE TRANSACTION
08-12-2017T17:15:36,w0lfmare,"One of their main ideas for it was ""creators always get exactly 95%"" though. They couldn't say that if it was optional"
08-12-2017T17:16:47,SageSaga,"but its a failure because you are saying ""This is good for the creator!"" and not realizing ""My customers all have customers that are integral to our success and theirs"""
08-12-2017T17:17:42,TheBeckoner,&gt;insert good time for someone to swoop in and make a good patreon alternative
08-12-2017T17:18:11,SageSaga,i think with the blow back Patreon might change
08-12-2017T17:18:24,w0lfmare,Have you lost any patrons over it Sage?
08-12-2017T17:18:48,SageSaga,yep
08-12-2017T17:19:02,SageSaga,one messaged me to let me know and i told him what i think and that i understood
08-12-2017T17:19:32,SageSaga,also sent him my Paypal.me and email if he ever wants a commission
08-12-2017T17:20:15,w0lfmare,"Yeah, same"
08-12-2017T17:20:30,w0lfmare,It seems to hit extra hard for people living outside the US
08-12-2017T17:23:21,w0lfmare,I've been looking to setup some kind of alternative
08-12-2017T17:25:10,SageSaga,Kickstarter is starting something
08-12-2017T17:26:04,SageSaga,they are making a Patreon clone thing
08-12-2017T17:28:03,w0lfmare,Interesting
08-12-2017T17:30:34,ZizzoGaming,Hm
08-12-2017T17:31:34,thestooge,"Glad we're seeing more of this cuite, Sage ;)"
08-12-2017T17:31:54,Bgrmystr2,Some people have dropped their tier costs to make up for the fees and such
08-12-2017T17:32:31,Bgrmystr2,"but overall, I've read that it went from creators getting 80-85% down to creators getting around 70%"
08-12-2017T17:32:34,Bgrmystr2,of what patrons pay
08-12-2017T17:33:11,Bgrmystr2,It seems like a lose-lose no matter what side you're on.
08-12-2017T17:33:20,Bgrmystr2,unless you're patreon. :thinking:
08-12-2017T17:33:23,SageSaga,it's the fee per pledge that is insulting
08-12-2017T17:34:09,ViscariaSongbird,Wolf Stream! And I might have missed it
08-12-2017T17:34:16,Bgrmystr2,hey Vis
08-12-2017T17:34:21,ViscariaSongbird,Hi
08-12-2017T17:34:48,SageSaga,if you pledge 1 dollar to 20 people - patreon does one 20 dollar charge... but with this new fee system they pay transaction fees per pledge so 20 transaction fees for 1 transaction
08-12-2017T17:35:01,w0lfmare,Hey Viscaria
08-12-2017T17:35:12,SageSaga,if it were just a percentage it wouldnt mean much but the 35 cents per transaction stacks
08-12-2017T17:35:12,ViscariaSongbird,Hi Wolfmare
08-12-2017T17:35:46,FoxxTrotter,"Hey, Viscaria."
08-12-2017T17:35:53,Bgrmystr2,and the 35 cent sucks for $1 pledges too
08-12-2017T17:36:06,ViscariaSongbird,hi fox
08-12-2017T17:36:09,w0lfmare,"Yeah, I hope they realize that this update was a mistake"
08-12-2017T17:36:36,ViscariaSongbird,we can pray on that
08-12-2017T17:37:36,w0lfmare,I don't think we'll really know how bad it will be until January 5th rolls around
08-12-2017T17:39:00,Bgrmystr2,"a lot of people are calculating some pretty bad numbers, and I've also seen some people saying they're shutting down their patreon when the change hits."
08-12-2017T17:40:24,SageSaga,calculating bad numbers? as in getting different numbers? because its really simple math o_o
08-12-2017T17:40:46,Bgrmystr2,"no, as in the numbers they calculated look bad o.O"
08-12-2017T17:40:55,Bgrmystr2,compared to before the change
08-12-2017T17:41:35,w0lfmare,Well it's hard to predict the factor of patrons lowering or deleting their pledges
08-12-2017T17:41:46,SageSaga,a lot of those numbers are no different to what Creators were paying originally
08-12-2017T17:43:21,SageSaga,the only place its really screwed up is when people are pledged to multiple creators
08-12-2017T17:43:40,SageSaga,the more the worse because its multiplicative
08-12-2017T17:44:13,Bgrmystr2,"Paying $100 to one creator would cost $103.25, but paying 100 creators $1 would cost $138"
08-12-2017T17:44:32,SageSaga,exactly
08-12-2017T17:44:59,Bgrmystr2,I would consider that bad xD
08-12-2017T17:45:41,SageSaga,look at it this way- if a creator had 100 1 dollar subs then they had to pay the fines of 38 dollars + 5% more
08-12-2017T17:45:49,ViscariaSongbird,looks like you would have to chose your artists with care
08-12-2017T17:46:30,SageSaga,easiest solution is to give patrons a check box for if they want to pay the fees
08-12-2017T17:46:42,SageSaga,or have the fee taken out of the pledge
08-12-2017T17:47:33,SageSaga,but yeah- right now if i had 100 one dollar pledges i would only get 57 dollars
08-12-2017T17:49:28,SageSaga,"i wish they had a yearly patreon option ""Hey I could afford to send you a dollar a month but the fees take so much- so what if i gave you 12 dollars a year?"""
08-12-2017T17:49:47,Bgrmystr2,"There just doesn't seem like a whole lot of benefit either way. Patreon's getting their fee money from someone, whether it be the creators or the patrons :/"
08-12-2017T17:50:33,SageSaga,yeah- which is why again - it would make more sense to leave it as it is now- or give patrons an option so they can choose to pay for their creators or not
08-12-2017T17:57:29,Kiit0s,o/
08-12-2017T17:58:09,FoxxTrotter,"Hey, Kiit0s."

08-12-2017T20:05:06,w0lfmare,Maybe you're too tense when you draw?
