02-11-2017T20:57:39,TorqueEmUp,There is no reason it should have those apps.
02-11-2017T20:57:45,Bgrmystr2,why would you need them on the switch?
02-11-2017T20:57:46,TorqueEmUp,shouldn't*

02-11-2017T20:58:52,ZRO4825,"Wait, they're NOT on the Switch? WTF, they're on the WiiU"
02-11-2017T20:59:20,Dadrobit,3DS is gonna get them before the Switch
02-11-2017T20:59:21,TorqueEmUp,"Granted I have about 4 devices hooked up to my TV, and the TV itself, that all can stream from any of those services. lol"
02-11-2017T20:59:38,SageSaga,&lt;_&lt; 3DS already has Netflix i think XD

02-11-2017T21:18:40,unsteddyphoenix,"Speak the queens english, you american swine"
02-11-2017T21:18:59,TorqueEmUp,Too bad the queen is German. :P
02-11-2017T21:18:59,Serpentfrog,Then it would be organisation.
02-11-2017T21:19:07,Bgrmystr2,No phoenix
02-11-2017T21:19:26,Celestine,OHHHHHHH TORQUE BURRRNNN
02-11-2017T21:19:35,unsteddyphoenix,I was actually saying origin-station
02-11-2017T21:19:59,unsteddyphoenix,Just using slang though
02-11-2017T21:20:04,unsteddyphoenix,Jeez cant you tell?
02-11-2017T21:20:04,neropan,woa
02-11-2017T21:20:09,BadFoMo,What did Tom write? I can't read it.
02-11-2017T21:20:24,Bgrmystr2,Reni is asking trace if he would vouch for the wolves
02-11-2017T21:20:25,ZRO4825,Tree Fitty
02-11-2017T21:20:26,Serpentfrog,"Not enough levels of irony for that, sadly."
02-11-2017T21:20:28,Celestine,tom wrote

02-11-2017T21:20:41,Ordithus,jinx
02-11-2017T21:20:42,Zakuru,wow ok
02-11-2017T21:20:45,Bgrmystr2,lol Cel xD
02-11-2017T21:20:50,unsteddyphoenix,Wrong dragon
02-11-2017T21:20:55,ZRO4825,Every dragon.
02-11-2017T21:21:06,unsteddyphoenix,Every female being*
02-11-2017T21:21:07,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Rock the Dragon
02-11-2017T21:21:10,Ordithus,"we even both missed the second """
02-11-2017T21:21:10,Celestine,Trace knows what the dragon's like
02-11-2017T21:21:17,ZRO4825,Trace Legacy - Dragon Layer.
02-11-2017T21:21:17,BadFoMo,Thank you.
02-11-2017T21:21:27,Bgrmystr2,"now see Torque, if you wanted a worried Natani, that middle panel there"
02-11-2017T21:21:32,Bgrmystr2,that's applicable
02-11-2017T21:21:36,TorqueEmUp,Even though technically Nat only stayed with the group initially to keep an eye on Trace.
02-11-2017T21:21:41,Serpentfrog,“Dragon’s like”:ctwokinds-keifacepalm:
02-11-2017T21:21:49,Celestine,God this is reminding me of a lot and D&D right now
02-11-2017T21:22:02,TorqueEmUp,Ehh they are both worried Bgr.
02-11-2017T21:22:22,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno Torque, seen too many faces to consider that top one"
02-11-2017T21:22:22,ZRO4825,"Which part of it, Cel? The dragons, the people, or the comments about banging said dragon? :P"
02-11-2017T21:22:25,Serpentfrog,They’re not killing the dragon. Analogy rejected.
02-11-2017T21:23:02,Celestine,Zro my response is
02-11-2017T21:23:04,Celestine,Ye
02-11-2017T21:23:08,Celestine,*Yes
02-11-2017T21:23:12,ZRO4825,lol
02-11-2017T21:23:16,Bgrmystr2,good response.
02-11-2017T21:23:24,MuonNeutrino,ahahh that expression on rose
02-11-2017T21:23:33,MuonNeutrino,i dont even know what the characters are saying and it's already glorious
02-11-2017T21:23:37,Serpentfrog,#DragonsArePeo
02-11-2017T21:23:42,BadFoMo,"Trace: Um, yeah, I guess. Reni: Good! If it's a trap, I can blame you."
02-11-2017T21:23:45,Serpentfrog,*PeopleToo
02-11-2017T21:23:49,Celestine,I hosted a pathfinder game where this lizard druid king guy's wife was a trex
02-11-2017T21:23:58,TorqueEmUp,lol FoMo
02-11-2017T21:24:07,Celestine,and the party ended up killing the trex before they arrived in the village
02-11-2017T21:24:49,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, I don't see why Reni can't just go into Natani's mind and make sure she's telling the truth?"
02-11-2017T21:25:01,Celestine,oooooh
02-11-2017T21:25:01,Bgrmystr2,seems easier
02-11-2017T21:25:06,Celestine,Reni is the dragon princess lady
02-11-2017T21:25:23,unsteddyphoenix,She cant understand keidran thoguh
02-11-2017T21:25:27,Ordithus,"Weeeell, Natani is an assassin still following Trace on assignment, kinda."
02-11-2017T21:25:37,Bgrmystr2,you don't need to understand keidran to see what happened to Zen's leg
02-11-2017T21:25:39,TorqueEmUp,yeah pretty much
02-11-2017T21:25:41,ZRO4825,Wasn't she originally assassinating Keith??
02-11-2017T21:25:44,Bgrmystr2,"pain is universal, bro"
02-11-2017T21:25:52,Bgrmystr2,language is unneeded.
02-11-2017T21:25:55,ZahnHolley,Hi everyone
02-11-2017T21:25:56,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Zen's leg :(
02-11-2017T21:25:56,Ordithus,Keith was collateral damage.
02-11-2017T21:26:00,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Zahn
02-11-2017T21:26:02,Crosseyedscribbles,i think originally she was after flora
02-11-2017T21:26:05,Serpentfrog,"Hi, Zahn."
02-11-2017T21:26:19,unsteddyphoenix,"Even if she knows Zens leg is injured, she doesnt know for sure that it's not a trap of some kind."
02-11-2017T21:26:29,Ordithus,"Yeah, killing Trace was like a bonus :ptv-laugh:"
02-11-2017T21:26:30,Celestine,Flora is also apparently a princess...
02-11-2017T21:26:30,ZahnHolley,How are you guys its been a week.
02-11-2017T21:26:32,Nekonny,brb
02-11-2017T21:26:33,unsteddyphoenix,"Though, admittedly that WOULD be extremely paranoid of her"
02-11-2017T21:26:37,unsteddyphoenix,If she still didnt believe it
02-11-2017T21:26:42,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: yeh
02-11-2017T21:26:51,Bgrmystr2,going that far for a trap
02-11-2017T21:26:56,Bgrmystr2,seems pretty excessive
02-11-2017T21:27:15,Dadrobit,"Well, I mean, they did just have a Wolf attack just the previous day."
02-11-2017T21:27:28,Celestine,DUN DUN DUUUUUUUN
02-11-2017T21:27:28,Dadrobit,That had subterfuge at its core
02-11-2017T21:27:31,TorqueEmUp,I mean Nat and Trace haven't really had a whole lot of interaction.
02-11-2017T21:27:33,unsteddyphoenix,True
02-11-2017T21:27:41,Serpentfrog,Tricksy wolfses.
02-11-2017T21:27:49,Celestine,Not that we've seen Torque...
02-11-2017T21:27:53,Bgrmystr2,"well, Nora already said she cleared everyone Trace was with."
02-11-2017T21:27:58,Ordithus,"Yeah, it's really new to see Natani look to Trace, at all."
02-11-2017T21:28:04,unsteddyphoenix,Did she?
02-11-2017T21:28:09,Bgrmystr2,yup
02-11-2017T21:28:09,TorqueEmUp,Ok Gollum back to your cave
02-11-2017T21:28:22,Celestine,GOLLUM GOLLUM!
02-11-2017T21:28:25,unsteddyphoenix,"I thought she said ""go away im talking to my husbando"""
02-11-2017T21:28:28,ZahnHolley,I have a question is cintiq hard to work with?
02-11-2017T21:28:36,Serpentfrog,You forgot “and never come back!”
02-11-2017T21:28:48,Bgrmystr2,"it was in there, she said the wolves trace was with didn't have anything to do with the attack on the city lol"
02-11-2017T21:29:04,Dadrobit,"Pretty much they've had almost no direct interaction. Neither speaks the other's language, (much) so everything has to go through either Flora or Keith."
02-11-2017T21:29:26,TorqueEmUp,Yup
02-11-2017T21:29:45,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah. Basically Trace has to trust his friend who trusts his friend lol
02-11-2017T21:29:50,Ordithus,Nora freaking out Reni: http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/958/
02-11-2017T21:30:39,TorqueEmUp,"Trace, the probably most clueless person out of everyone in that Estate right now. lol"
02-11-2017T21:30:52,Dadrobit,"Naw, that'd be Kat"
02-11-2017T21:30:55,unsteddyphoenix,Though Reni should probably see from Traces memories that he's basically never talked with Nat lol
02-11-2017T21:30:57,Celestine,sage do you play D&D or pathfinder?
02-11-2017T21:30:58,TorqueEmUp,true
02-11-2017T21:30:59,Serpentfrog,:ctwokinds-sadtrace2:
02-11-2017T21:31:02,TorqueEmUp,only second to Kat
02-11-2017T21:31:07,Celestine,you seem like you're the guy who would based on your comics &gt;.&gt;
02-11-2017T21:31:08,SageSaga,Both
02-11-2017T21:31:09,TorqueEmUp,But Kat is smarter than she lets on.
02-11-2017T21:31:12,Celestine,ice
02-11-2017T21:31:13,Ordithus,The one time they talked to each other was when the ship was on fire.
02-11-2017T21:31:15,Celestine,*nice
02-11-2017T21:31:17,SageSaga,but i currently prefer 5e
02-11-2017T21:31:21,qwe304,its safr that trace stay uninformed of many things
02-11-2017T21:31:27,SageSaga,just easier to get a game going and characters made
02-11-2017T21:31:30,Celestine,I only recently got into pathfinder
02-11-2017T21:31:31,SageSaga,Pathfinder is a lot more work
02-11-2017T21:31:45,Celestine,hmmm
02-11-2017T21:31:55,Ordithus,And that was still via Flora.
02-11-2017T21:31:59,Celestine,might have to go to D&D again then :T
02-11-2017T21:32:09,Ordithus,"Wait, Mike."
02-11-2017T21:32:11,Celestine,"well not again, i mean i've never played D&D"
02-11-2017T21:32:17,TorqueEmUp,same
02-11-2017T21:32:33,Dadrobit,"Reni ""Sooo, this wolf tried to kill you, then you let it travel with you immediately afterwords and have barely talked at all since? Yeah, totally trustworthy."""
02-11-2017T21:32:34,TorqueEmUp,got a friend though that is trying to put a group and everything together.
02-11-2017T21:32:47,Serpentfrog,"Remember, Trace knows things when they are convenient to the plot. E.g. how to speak Basitin."
02-11-2017T21:32:52,Celestine,oh man
02-11-2017T21:32:54,Bgrmystr2,"lol well, lotta things changed since then, Dadro"
02-11-2017T21:33:10,Celestine,i'm rereading your comic again while high
02-11-2017T21:33:21,SageSaga,really you can have fun in any system- ones not exactly superior- ok thats not totally true
02-11-2017T21:33:27,Serpentfrog,“Afterwords” :ctwokinds-keifacepalm:
02-11-2017T21:33:36,Celestine,"it is lovely, i'm connecting a lot more with it"
02-11-2017T21:33:37,SageSaga,Pathfinder is amazing- but super complex
02-11-2017T21:33:42,unsteddyphoenix,This is more about Trace trusting Keiths judgement rahter than his own. I wouldnt be surprised if Trace looking at Keith for help is one of the last two panels
02-11-2017T21:33:49,BadFoMo,"@Dadrobit Reni: Eh, **** it; let's just go."
02-11-2017T21:33:55,ZahnHolley,Keidrans speak there own languages
02-11-2017T21:33:57,SageSaga,5e is really easy and REALLY open so you just have to accept the rule of cool and go with it
02-11-2017T21:34:02,Celestine,i don't like the limits pathfinder society sets on itself though
02-11-2017T21:34:14,Serpentfrog,“There own” :ctwokinds-keifacepalm:
02-11-2017T21:34:42,Bgrmystr2,This page is going to be important to Rose
02-11-2017T21:34:42,SageSaga,Savage Worlds is extremely easy and great for a ton of stuff
02-11-2017T21:34:53,Bgrmystr2,It's going to solidify to her that Trace has changed as a person
02-11-2017T21:35:02,Ordithus,SW was the first system I rp'd with... really easy
02-11-2017T21:35:08,TorqueEmUp,I like these alots allot. :P
02-11-2017T21:35:12,Celestine,bgrmystr only because he has lost his memory
02-11-2017T21:35:20,Bgrmystr2,"Yeah, of course"
02-11-2017T21:35:23,Celestine,like Trace was committing genocide on all keidran kind
02-11-2017T21:35:30,Serpentfrog,casually stabs Torque.
02-11-2017T21:35:31,Bgrmystr2,but he's slowly gaining his memories again
02-11-2017T21:35:34,Celestine,that takes a man in it pretty deep psychologically
02-11-2017T21:35:41,Bgrmystr2,and he hasn't gone evil yet
02-11-2017T21:35:48,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Frog and his friendly stabbing
02-11-2017T21:35:49,Celestine,'yet'
02-11-2017T21:35:50,TorqueEmUp,"""yet"""
02-11-2017T21:35:52,Dadrobit,"Yeah, Bgr, he's definitely changed, now instead of killing keidrans, he's switched it up to basitins and mostly human children."
02-11-2017T21:36:03,Dadrobit,:D
02-11-2017T21:36:13,Celestine,i'm actually hoping this comic has a dark end where trace goes back to the dark side
02-11-2017T21:36:14,Serpentfrog,"Nothing friendly about it, Marv."
02-11-2017T21:36:23,Celestine,and it becomes like some star wars stuff
02-11-2017T21:36:24,Bgrmystr2,"Trace anti-human confirmt, lol dadro"
02-11-2017T21:36:31,ZahnHolley,"Im anxious for black friday there lots of good deals in the market, i might save up to get a switch,"
02-11-2017T21:36:48,Dadrobit,I'll have a snowball fight in Phoenix in July before that happens Cel.
02-11-2017T21:36:57,Bgrmystr2,I have literally zero money for black Friday
02-11-2017T21:36:58,Serpentfrog,You might... switch your cash for a console.
02-11-2017T21:37:05,Bgrmystr2,but I usually don't spend money on that day anyway
02-11-2017T21:37:17,Bgrmystr2,everything on sale is usually stuff that they can't sell cuz noone buys it
02-11-2017T21:37:25,Bgrmystr2,it's just stuff that's been sitting aroun
02-11-2017T21:37:27,Bgrmystr2,d
02-11-2017T21:37:32,unsteddyphoenix,"If someone has no recollection of committing a crime, should they still be punished for it? :thinking:"
02-11-2017T21:37:33,TorqueEmUp,"Oh yeah, I almost forget that he killed those templar when he was chained"
02-11-2017T21:37:39,Bgrmystr2,"Polite pass, really."
02-11-2017T21:37:45,ZahnHolley,I only have 74 dollars in my wallet not enough for the switch.
02-11-2017T21:38:01,TorqueEmUp,Yes unsteddy
02-11-2017T21:38:02,Dadrobit,yes.
02-11-2017T21:38:05,qwe304,@unsteddyphoenix depends on the type of crime
02-11-2017T21:38:05,MidnightBlue78,"well, if someone else remebers they committed the crime, yes"
02-11-2017T21:38:06,Serpentfrog,“Noone” :ctwokinds-keifacepalm:
02-11-2017T21:38:16,MarvTheHugPharaoh,noone one
02-11-2017T21:38:24,Bgrmystr2,"they are technically a different person, so I would say no. If you can confirm WITHOUT A DOUBT that they were not the same person, mentally."
02-11-2017T21:38:50,Bgrmystr2,"Who you are, mentally, defines what actions you would make"
02-11-2017T21:39:00,Bgrmystr2,that is what judgement should be based on.
02-11-2017T21:39:16,MidnightBlue78,you're still responsible for your actions
02-11-2017T21:39:22,Serpentfrog,So... brain scan?
02-11-2017T21:39:28,MidnightBlue78,regardless if you remeber or not
02-11-2017T21:39:30,unsteddyphoenix,I dont think Rose can confirm that herself
02-11-2017T21:39:33,Bgrmystr2,"Yes, the ones you WOULD make with the same thought process, Midnight"
02-11-2017T21:39:33,MuonNeutrino,"legally speaking, i guess it'd be a variant on the 'not guilty by reason of insanity' thing &gt;.&gt;"
02-11-2017T21:39:34,unsteddyphoenix,She can be TOLD that
02-11-2017T21:39:56,unsteddyphoenix,But unsure if she would trust a dragon likely paid by rich humans
02-11-2017T21:40:01,Dadrobit,"You'd still be locked up Muon, unless it was like a crime of passion or something."
02-11-2017T21:40:16,Dadrobit,You'd just have a padded room instead
02-11-2017T21:40:16,Bgrmystr2,"Remembering or not is irrelevant. In real life, you can't use it as an excuse becuse we have no real way to prove someone is different, mentally."
02-11-2017T21:40:18,andrewfr8man,Evening all.
02-11-2017T21:40:23,TorqueEmUp,"If something alters your state of mind, that isn't caused by someone else, or something completely outside your power, then yeah you shouldn't be help accountable."

02-11-2017T21:40:56,andrewfr8man,Where's Marv?
02-11-2017T21:40:57,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"digs from underneath andrew, and pulls him into the ground Tremors style, then hugs him"
02-11-2017T21:41:04,andrewfr8man,AHHHHH!!!!
02-11-2017T21:41:06,Bgrmystr2,and there it is.
02-11-2017T21:41:15,MarvTheHugPharaoh,HI Andrew ;)
02-11-2017T21:41:21,Bgrmystr2,You knew it was coming
02-11-2017T21:41:28,Ordithus,"Ron, stop freezing."

02-11-2017T22:10:40,ZRO4825,She has teeth and claws. You try to tell Flora no.
02-11-2017T22:10:43,unsteddyphoenix,Reni could probably carry just Natani and Trace or something
02-11-2017T22:10:44,Ordithus,And miss riding a dragon?
02-11-2017T22:10:47,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Reni's basically as big as steve buscemi
02-11-2017T22:11:08,CrimsonHelsing,And Flora is undoubtedly hormonal xP
02-11-2017T22:11:29,TorqueEmUp,dem hormones

02-11-2017T22:18:20,Dadrobit,It's mostly legal in AZ. Getting your green card is as easy as nothing.
02-11-2017T22:18:21,TorqueEmUp,Too many people with deep pockets that wouldn't allow alcohol or tobacco to become illegal
02-11-2017T22:18:27,Celestine,and I just take the back roads going home where the cops aren't

02-11-2017T22:24:57,MidnightBlue78,pizza is good as long as it doesnt have pineapple
02-11-2017T22:25:02,Tharkis,they caused papa johns and pizzahut to both go out of business and close in my town
02-11-2017T22:25:03,Celestine,how could you betray me like this? :ptv-shock:

02-11-2017T22:25:26,ZRO4825,Pizza Hut has gone downhill. Papa John's is okay. Domino's is good.
02-11-2017T22:25:37,Tharkis,papa ginos is best but they're a local chain
02-11-2017T22:25:40,Nekonny,I liked super supreme from pizza hut
02-11-2017T22:25:43,ZRO4825,I get Papa John's when I'm tired of eating the pizza from my own store. :rofl:

02-11-2017T22:25:48,Celestine,maybe that is the same with dominos then?
02-11-2017T22:25:49,SageSaga,they also fired a guy for helping a new person for 5 minutes over their time
02-11-2017T22:25:56,qwe304,i like papa murphys stuffed pizza
02-11-2017T22:25:57,Celestine,because in my city dominos and pizza hut are garbage

02-11-2017T22:27:15,SageSaga,i normally dont judge based on one persons perspective
02-11-2017T22:27:15,Kagiyama89,:ptv-sad:
02-11-2017T22:27:16,ZRO4825,Typically speaking all of the stores in a specific region SHOULD taste the same.
02-11-2017T22:27:22,BadFoMo,Why is Zen in just his shorts?
02-11-2017T22:27:22,Tharkis,and a lot of local chains in new england that are fantastic universally

02-11-2017T22:27:36,ZRO4825,Because they should all be getting their ingredients from the same central chain.
02-11-2017T22:27:41,Bgrmystr2,"@Kagiyama89 lol, that was nothing out of the ordinary. Calm down Hina :V"

02-11-2017T23:30:10,Bgrmystr2,but lets ignore me lol
02-11-2017T23:30:23,Celestine,so mirahi would you like to tell me more about your character?
02-11-2017T23:30:24,SageSaga,they used some treasure to make some clothes- Platinum cloth
02-11-2017T23:30:28,Bgrmystr2,"lol Hina, there's three streams, not just one"
02-11-2017T23:30:30,ZRO4825,Ahh...now I remember why I don't like using this TV as a monitor like this. it doesn't scan right. The screensize doesn't match the TV's screen. And it's a bitch to fix. -.-
02-11-2017T23:30:40,unsteddyphoenix,That is so absurdly decadant
02-11-2017T23:30:51,Ordithus,did you try percussive maintenance?
02-11-2017T23:30:52,Kagiyama89,.. Platinum panties?
02-11-2017T23:30:52,Celestine,"platinum cloth, because silk is for poor people"

02-11-2017T23:30:55,Bgrmystr2,"gotta probably change the resolution, zro"

02-11-2017T23:31:17,Serpentfrog,Platinum... cloth? Is it metal or fabric?
02-11-2017T23:31:28,Bgrmystr2,it might be that your tv isn't properly calibrated
02-11-2017T23:31:44,ZRO4825,TV works perfectly fine for everything else that is 1080p~
02-11-2017T23:31:45,Kagiyama89,it's.. 95% platinum alloy that bends?
02-11-2017T23:31:48,unsteddyphoenix,Make sure the plugs arent in the wrong holes
02-11-2017T23:31:54,KizunaDragonWolf,No you didn't
02-11-2017T23:31:55,unsteddyphoenix,That can make things go very badly
02-11-2017T23:31:55,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, cuz it's calibrated for that"
02-11-2017T23:32:05,ZRO4825,"Oh no worries Unsteddy, I'm great at getting the right things in the right holes."
02-11-2017T23:32:08,Kagiyama89,neropanties the weird hilbilly redneck
02-11-2017T23:32:10,Bgrmystr2,they usually gotta calibrate for every little thing lol
02-11-2017T23:32:14,unsteddyphoenix,I have no faith
02-11-2017T23:32:14,KizunaDragonWolf,I just scrolled up and I didn't see you say hi once
02-11-2017T23:32:19,SageSaga,its mostly just silk but with woven platinum threads

02-11-2017T23:33:43,SageSaga,Tom's character was wearing a fancy suit made of the same stuff - so they all had matching outfits
02-11-2017T23:33:44,Mihari,"Sorry, not really up to sharing background info on her atm, and besides I doubt the rest of the chat wants to hear and I hate picarto whispers XD"

02-11-2017T23:35:13,KizunaDragonWolf,I would like to do a multistream but idk if they would allow any of us to do one with them

02-11-2017T23:35:38,Ordithus,"no votes against, so far!"
02-11-2017T23:35:40,unsteddyphoenix,100% of those who votes said yes 0% said no
02-11-2017T23:35:52,Bgrmystr2,can't argue with those odds haha
02-11-2017T23:35:55,SpotTheLeopard,"I'm just quiet for the most part, but I'll vote for"

02-11-2017T23:50:37,Kagiyama89,"well, you finished inking / lining, TwoKinds!"
02-11-2017T23:50:37,SageSaga,the answer is- Consume it's spirit for source. Of course

02-11-2017T23:50:53,Serpentfrog,"So I was right, Sage?"
02-11-2017T23:50:56,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I thought the correct answer was scream
02-11-2017T23:51:07,Mihari,There was a correct answer?
02-11-2017T23:51:12,neropan,the answer is cream

02-11-2017T23:51:22,SageSaga,there's always a correct answer
02-11-2017T23:51:23,Kagiyama89,the correct answer depends on how intimate you are with the ghost
02-11-2017T23:51:30,unsteddyphoenix,Absorb it in a friendly way
02-11-2017T23:51:40,MarvTheHugPharaoh,does ghost man have nards?
02-11-2017T23:51:41,Kagiyama89,"Casper does not like it when you touch him there, oh no"
02-11-2017T23:51:43,Ordithus,Some would say walking through a person is quite intimate.
02-11-2017T23:52:00,Kagiyama89,does that mean there's lots of intimate touching in G-Mod?
