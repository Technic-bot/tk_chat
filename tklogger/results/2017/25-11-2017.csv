25-11-2017T14:40:46,MidnightBlue78,hey guys :)
25-11-2017T14:40:50,BluePhantom90,hey
25-11-2017T14:40:54,NeonMitsumi,Heyyo
25-11-2017T14:41:06,MidnightBlue78,oh look! A Poofball!!! :D
25-11-2017T14:41:18,NeonMitsumi,Floof! &lt;3
25-11-2017T14:42:02,MidnightBlue78,too much cuteness
25-11-2017T14:42:28,BluePhantom90,was hoping tom would do the same with Flora and Trace. But since his hand hurt I understand
25-11-2017T14:43:12,NeonMitsumi,rolls eyes.
25-11-2017T14:53:15,JumpyLizard,Is the streaming today?
25-11-2017T14:53:57,BluePhantom90,should be. BUT Tom was sick on Friday. so we don't know if it will happen
25-11-2017T14:54:54,NeonMitsumi,"I mean, he did open idea submissions. However I am worried that he might end up in even worse condition after all of this."
25-11-2017T14:55:33,BluePhantom90,Well Its because he doesn't like to go out often.
25-11-2017T14:56:40,BluePhantom90,"If your cooped up in a house/room for so long and with no fresh air cycled though, or messed with other germs you will get sick real easy"
25-11-2017T14:56:45,JumpyLizard,"Well... Here it is 10 pm, so I  going to sleep.  Bye"
25-11-2017T14:56:56,MidnightBlue78,bye Jumpy
25-11-2017T14:57:00,NeonMitsumi,Don't forget his hand.
25-11-2017T14:57:02,BluePhantom90,night
25-11-2017T14:57:03,NeonMitsumi,Night Jumpy.
25-11-2017T14:57:42,MidnightBlue78,i prefer he gets well before attempting anything
25-11-2017T14:57:59,NeonMitsumi,Same. Health is the priority.
25-11-2017T14:59:51,BluePhantom90,"and that he needs something to exercise his hand. If you don't do that and continue doing art for a long time, you can get issues. Should buy Tom one. Like that one from Doctor Strange."
25-11-2017T15:25:50,Bgrmystr2,"Blue, you do know that's not true? Being cooped up in a house or room for a long period of time will not make you any more succeptable to germs or disease."
25-11-2017T15:25:57,Bgrmystr2,it's just blatantly fals.
25-11-2017T15:26:01,Bgrmystr2,"false, even"
25-11-2017T15:26:51,Bgrmystr2,"not good on a variety of other levels, sure"

25-11-2017T15:45:13,BluePhantom90,But a brotherhood. People you know you can count on to help. Military is great for that. Just sucks when NCO's get involved because they are the ones that give you orders
25-11-2017T15:45:37,NeonMitsumi,lifts an eyebrow.
25-11-2017T15:45:40,Bgrmystr2,"It's just other people in general, Blue lol"
25-11-2017T15:46:15,BluePhantom90,Well the whole idea idea is. You can count on the person beside you to back you just as much the other can count on you.
25-11-2017T15:46:54,Xexanoth,until you stop being in the military and no one gives a fuck anymore
25-11-2017T15:47:18,BluePhantom90,"I mean We had some epic moments in life with a mother who was out of breath and just wanted to give up, We cheered and motivate her to keep going. Our squad got 1st place because of her."

25-11-2017T16:38:01,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Hey y'all, I do have a question: why do y'all think crossover requests don't do that well in the votes?  Yes, I know that some crossovers won in the past, but usually they don't win or score high enough.  Why do you suppose that is?"
25-11-2017T16:38:05,SailorFederation,Hey Foxy!
25-11-2017T16:38:11,NeonMitsumi,Heyyo Foxy!

25-11-2017T16:38:30,w0lfmare,:cw0lfmare-HeadEmber:
25-11-2017T16:38:33,Bgrmystr2,Because not everyone knows that crossover.

25-11-2017T16:38:41,Kamaro12,@Palmetto: probably because there's not enough of the crossover's fanbase represented in the 2k community
25-11-2017T16:38:45,ThingsAreMoving,o/ W0lf
25-11-2017T16:38:45,Xexanoth,Even if you know the Crossover you might not vote for it
25-11-2017T16:38:48,unsteddyphoenix,Because I dont like starcraft lol
25-11-2017T16:38:48,SailorFederation,"I generally find there arent any /bad/ options that people dont like, its just deciding whats better I suppose"

25-11-2017T16:38:55,Kamaro12,most people in these streams just want to see the 2k characters

25-11-2017T16:39:13,MidnightBlue78,"at least, i prefer 2k characters always"
25-11-2017T16:39:15,BoxStealthFox,"Try to disguise the crossover, like dont call it x + y, but describe it"
25-11-2017T16:39:15,Kynum,sup W0lf
25-11-2017T16:39:16,SailorFederation,anyways imma dip for a bit before his stream RKOs me again
25-11-2017T16:39:20,Sammit,Hi Mekal
25-11-2017T16:39:23,SailorFederation,brb
25-11-2017T16:39:29,MuonNeutrino,"the thing about crossovers is that it inherently divides the voter base - everyone voting knows about/is a fan of TK, not everyone will know or care about whatever other universe the crossover is, and even if they do they many not like the crossover idea"
25-11-2017T16:39:32,Xexanoth,"Also i'd rather vote for a funny suggestion, like the nora one, instead of just having the Characters in a different outfit"
25-11-2017T16:39:33,MidnightBlue78,It's what I'm familiar with
25-11-2017T16:39:47,Bgrmystr2,What Muon said lol
25-11-2017T16:39:51,MidnightBlue78,i like funny/ cute things
25-11-2017T16:39:58,ThingsAreMoving,"why would a female squirrel kiss a female nimbat is beyond my small, innocent mind"
25-11-2017T16:40:07,Xexanoth,because cute
25-11-2017T16:40:16,FieryPenguin,"Sappy is what i vote for 100%, and maybe epic"
25-11-2017T16:40:16,Combak,You know why.
25-11-2017T16:40:24,MidnightBlue78,Bc they are good friends

25-11-2017T16:40:40,FenceEqualizer,You say that but Fidget does not look amused.
25-11-2017T16:40:43,ThingsAreMoving,I accept the explanation of cute
25-11-2017T16:40:55,MuonNeutrino,"and even if they know the other universe the crossover may not appeal - e.g. in this case i know and am a fan of starcraft, but i really don't think the two universes go together at all"
25-11-2017T16:41:07,KaleganTheFurryous,gotta go :( later guys
25-11-2017T16:41:11,w0lfmare,Hope you're feeling better Tom!

25-11-2017T16:41:32,FieryPenguin,#metoo
25-11-2017T16:41:38,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Well, I think crossovers have potential and I feel that we all should give it a chance, plus, you're still seeing the TK characters but dressed up.  I mean I know that a lot of people here are big Star Wars fans so you would think the Star Wars one would"
25-11-2017T16:41:43,PalmettoPathfinder1,have won.
25-11-2017T16:41:51,PalmettoPathfinder1,@Xexanoth  I agree!  Power Armor rocks!
25-11-2017T16:42:00,Kamaro12,"well, cant' decide the choices for the peopl"
25-11-2017T16:42:00,unsteddyphoenix,Stars wars one has won before
25-11-2017T16:42:02,Thatshyguy,did Tom remove the Currently playing thingie due to that firefox update?
25-11-2017T16:42:06,FieryPenguin,"welp, accidently his refresh, and now the stream wont play"
25-11-2017T16:42:10,FieryPenguin,...
25-11-2017T16:42:12,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Plus, the new SW movie comes out next month."
25-11-2017T16:42:16,FieryPenguin,hit
25-11-2017T16:42:18,MuonNeutrino,"@thatshyguy yes, it doesn't work with the new firefox"
25-11-2017T16:42:26,Wyvern088,does Scythe know Nibs is cheating on him?
25-11-2017T16:42:38,FieryPenguin,nvm

25-11-2017T16:43:10,ThingsAreMoving,Roberto needs a companion
25-11-2017T16:43:13,PalmettoPathfinder1,*smoking
25-11-2017T16:43:14,BadFoMo,@Tamerlee Oh...
25-11-2017T16:43:27,MuonNeutrino,"@palmettopathfinder1 yes, we are still seeing the TK characters in a crossover, but a lot of people, if they don't care about the crossover, would rather see the TK characters as themselves doing something in the TK universe that they'd find more interest"
25-11-2017T16:43:32,Bgrmystr2,"perhaps, Palm, but you and how many others?"
25-11-2017T16:43:37,FenceEqualizer,Who's Roberto?

25-11-2017T16:44:33,Xexanoth,"If you want to make the Crossover fun, do something like, Natani Challengges Adelaide for a Rematch, with her new secret Weapon a Terran Power Armor, or something like that"
25-11-2017T16:44:36,Sammit,Bye Mekal
25-11-2017T16:44:38,FenceEqualizer,Later Mekal.

25-11-2017T16:44:51,PalmettoPathfinder1,"@MuonNeutrino That's true, but unfortunately, I would like to see the TK characters in a crossover once in a while."
25-11-2017T16:44:52,ThingsAreMoving,Natani in a power armor? meh
25-11-2017T16:45:01,ThingsAreMoving,Nat in a ghost suit? Yisssssssss pls
25-11-2017T16:45:18,FieryPenguin,"Natani is an assassin, power armor doesn't really suit that"
25-11-2017T16:45:18,Serpentfrog,Musclehead general in a thor.
25-11-2017T16:45:22,MuonNeutrino,"@palmettopathfinder1 well, you'll probably have to come up with a crossover with wider appeal in that case"
25-11-2017T16:45:24,Wyvern088,I could be convinced to do such a thing
25-11-2017T16:45:25,unsteddyphoenix,It would have to be a good crossover
25-11-2017T16:45:30,ThingsAreMoving,rip musclehead
25-11-2017T16:45:32,unsteddyphoenix,Not just an outfit change
25-11-2017T16:45:42,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Alaric as Jotero from stardust crusaders
25-11-2017T16:45:43,PalmettoPathfinder1,"@Xexanoth That might work.  I'll have to think about how to word it so it would have a chance of winning, without people realizing it's a crossover."
25-11-2017T16:45:48,MuonNeutrino,"and/or a crossover that grab's *tom's* interest, for a tom pick"
25-11-2017T16:45:54,NeonMitsumi,Raine as JarJar
25-11-2017T16:45:54,MuonNeutrino,*grabs
25-11-2017T16:45:55,unsteddyphoenix,"No, dont do that lmao"
25-11-2017T16:45:59,ThingsAreMoving,Neon NO!
25-11-2017T16:46:00,ChromeDragon24,Neon pls
25-11-2017T16:46:03,MuonNeutrino,jfc no
25-11-2017T16:46:09,Xexanoth,Neon just solve the raine shipping war
25-11-2017T16:46:14,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Raine as Kenshiro
25-11-2017T16:46:16,Xexanoth,now no one is gonna want her
25-11-2017T16:46:21,NeonMitsumi,Hahahahahaha
25-11-2017T16:46:35,Serpentfrog,"I'd vote for it, Neon."
25-11-2017T16:46:49,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Well, @ThingsAreMoving I like that idea with Nat in a ghost/spectre outfit!"
25-11-2017T16:46:53,FieryPenguin,"Red as JarJar, a little more fitting"
25-11-2017T16:46:58,MarvTheHugPharaoh,^
25-11-2017T16:47:00,Xexanoth,"Raine could be from ranma, she changes species when hit with Cold/Warm water"
25-11-2017T16:47:00,ThingsAreMoving,^
25-11-2017T16:47:04,Bgrmystr2,I find it hysterical how many people hate him. xD
25-11-2017T16:47:14,ThingsAreMoving,"Who, JarJar or Red ?"
25-11-2017T16:47:18,MuonNeutrino,what's there not to hate? &gt;.&gt;
25-11-2017T16:47:18,Bgrmystr2,yes.
25-11-2017T16:47:20,NeonMitsumi,JarJar best Star Trek character
25-11-2017T16:47:23,FieryPenguin,"I don't hate red, he's just not the brightest"
25-11-2017T16:47:23,Bgrmystr2,but mostly the former
25-11-2017T16:47:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
25-11-2017T16:47:32,BadFoMo,So crossovers are a 50 - 50 shot. What about non-TwoKinds requests?
25-11-2017T16:47:33,Serpentfrog,Not as much as that bastard Wesley Crusher.
25-11-2017T16:47:43,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Also, there's a good chance of dressing Nat or Keith as the Witcher."
25-11-2017T16:47:49,PalmettoPathfinder1,might get suggested
25-11-2017T16:47:55,Serpentfrog,I already did that.
25-11-2017T16:47:56,MuonNeutrino,"@badfomo probably some of the same considerations - you gotta find something that appeals to lots of the voters, or tom"
25-11-2017T16:48:04,Xexanoth,"Tom likes Non Twokinds Pics, because it gives him something different to draw ^^"
25-11-2017T16:48:07,Bgrmystr2,"Honestly, there's nothing about JarJar that isn't seen in other shows, but noone else gets the same hatred."
25-11-2017T16:48:09,unsteddyphoenix,im pretty sure 90% of the red hate is marv
25-11-2017T16:48:14,unsteddyphoenix,Inflating the numbers
25-11-2017T16:48:18,NeonMitsumi,You aren't wrong.
25-11-2017T16:48:21,ChromeDragon24,^
25-11-2017T16:48:25,Bgrmystr2,"Marv is everyone, phoenix"
25-11-2017T16:48:39,Bgrmystr2,happened several streams ago bro xD
25-11-2017T16:48:43,MuonNeutrino,"i know tom's done a couple different freefall sketches along the way, for example, so a freefall request might grab his interest"
25-11-2017T16:48:44,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Marv's o/
25-11-2017T16:48:45,NeonMitsumi,MarvTheRedHatingPharaoh
25-11-2017T16:48:49,PalmettoPathfinder1,"That's a problem though, as while it's easy to come up with ideas that Tom might like to draw, it's a pain to figure out what the general TK stream audience likes."
25-11-2017T16:48:50,unsteddyphoenix,Marv fights an unwinnable battle
25-11-2017T16:48:56,Xexanoth,"@Bgr the problem is not that it's inherently bad, the problem is that it's too much"
25-11-2017T16:48:56,ThingsAreMoving,I'm the REAL Marv!
25-11-2017T16:49:03,NotDragonKai,Anyone knows what timezone the streaming timetable refers to?
25-11-2017T16:49:05,BoxStealthFox,"I am thou, thou art I"
25-11-2017T16:49:08,Bgrmystr2,"it's no more than anyone else, Xex lol"
25-11-2017T16:49:13,FieryPenguin,Russian time
25-11-2017T16:49:14,unsteddyphoenix,Dont try figure our what the stream will like. If it's good then Tom will pick it anyway
25-11-2017T16:49:16,BadFoMo,"@MuonNeutrino Well, the only one I had was Fidget accadentally turning Dust into a Nimbat."
25-11-2017T16:49:17,MuonNeutrino,@notdragonkai probably US eastern
25-11-2017T16:49:17,ChromeDragon24,will the real Marv stand up
25-11-2017T16:49:28,Bgrmystr2,"Eastern time, yeah"
25-11-2017T16:49:32,Serpentfrog,PST @notdragonkai.
25-11-2017T16:49:36,ZoopBoopLoop,"There should be a cap on character reqs, as not to overload on Keith and Natani Do a Thing #173."
25-11-2017T16:49:39,Bgrmystr2,Serp no
25-11-2017T16:49:43,Xexanoth,"@Bgr lemme Phrase it better, it's basicially about the amount of screentime and focus on his ""antics"""
25-11-2017T16:49:52,MuonNeutrino,"@badfomo he's done a couple of dust sketches too, so maybe he might pick that one for a tom pick"
25-11-2017T16:49:57,MuonNeutrino,i dunno
25-11-2017T16:49:58,PalmettoPathfinder1,"I guess that works though.  @ZoopBoopLoop, yeah that does make sense."
25-11-2017T16:50:02,Bgrmystr2,and that's the character's fault why?
25-11-2017T16:50:07,Bgrmystr2,"misplaced blame, bro"
25-11-2017T16:50:08,MuonNeutrino,"depends if he feels like doing a non-tk thing, and who knows?"
25-11-2017T16:50:18,qwe304,@ZoopBoopLoop there is an unspoken rule limiting to 4 characters
25-11-2017T16:50:19,Xexanoth,"no, it'S the writers fault, but that's why people hate the character"
25-11-2017T16:50:34,Kamaro12,who're we talking about?
25-11-2017T16:50:39,MuonNeutrino,jarjar &gt;.&gt;

25-11-2017T16:50:55,MidnightBlue78,donkey!
25-11-2017T16:51:00,BadFoMo,Karen as Jar Jar?
25-11-2017T16:51:03,Xexanoth,"it's like the Ewoks in the original, if they had stopped using em after the Rebels started the attack on the Shield Generator it would have been fine"
25-11-2017T16:51:12,Bgrmystr2,lots of characters are like him.
25-11-2017T16:51:13,Kamaro12,bgr: easier to hate the character on screen than to hunt down the person who wrote his character
25-11-2017T16:51:18,Xexanoth,but having them fight and win against the imperial army was just stupid
25-11-2017T16:51:24,MuonNeutrino,"to be fair, the ewoks are somewhat less universally disliked than jar jar is"
25-11-2017T16:51:25,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Yeah that's true.  I mean, the Dragon's Crown request scored high in the rankings, so it might win next time."
25-11-2017T16:51:29,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, people always take the easy road instead of the right one, Kam"
25-11-2017T16:51:32,Bgrmystr2,:c
25-11-2017T16:51:38,Kamaro12,"human nature, go figure :P"
25-11-2017T16:51:40,Xexanoth,but the problem is the same
25-11-2017T16:51:46,Xexanoth,aka George Lucas
25-11-2017T16:51:52,PalmettoPathfinder1,Or Disney
25-11-2017T16:51:52,FenceEqualizer,JarJar the Sith Lord. (As stupid as that whole theory was...I admit I kinda wish it happen)
25-11-2017T16:51:53,Xexanoth,and his terrible writing

25-11-2017T16:53:07,Bgrmystr2,"honestly, Muon, if they did that, and changed his ideas, they weren't 100% his ideas to begin with."

25-11-2017T16:53:30,MuonNeutrino,michael bay should stick to mindless action movies

25-11-2017T16:54:26,FenceEqualizer,He knows what he's doing.

25-11-2017T16:56:50,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Also, no one raised Cain when I mentioned them, so I guess people liked them or they thought they were okay."
25-11-2017T16:56:53,FenceEqualizer,See you say annoy everyone but he keeps making money off his films.
25-11-2017T16:56:58,FenceEqualizer,So it must be working.

25-11-2017T17:01:17,unsteddyphoenix,Most of them dont even make any sense
25-11-2017T17:01:19,Serpentfrog,Why are we going postal with our suggestions?
25-11-2017T17:01:33,ChromeDragon24,so we can send them by owl
25-11-2017T17:01:33,Bgrmystr2,"of course they don't, phoenix, that's why crossovers are so rare"
25-11-2017T17:01:42,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Well, @unsteddyphoenix it depends on the crossover."
25-11-2017T17:01:59,ThingsAreMoving,take your suggestions to the post office and post them to the nearest refuse collection company
25-11-2017T17:02:08,BadFoMo,@ThingsAreMoving @Serpentfrog The Runing With Sissers FPS that's 'only as violent as you are'?

25-11-2017T17:02:28,Serpentfrog,I know some of those words.
25-11-2017T17:02:43,PalmettoPathfinder1,The TK characters dressed up as characters from Starcraft makes sense (from an artistic or fan perspective)

25-11-2017T17:03:21,Bgrmystr2,and it wouldn't even fit in the story

25-11-2017T17:04:52,Zakuru,time for some lunch... at 5pm
25-11-2017T17:04:53,CrimsonHelsing,Teehee x3 this is adorable!
25-11-2017T17:04:54,ThingsAreMoving,grab a kit kat
25-11-2017T17:04:55,FieryPenguin,Nibbly seems to REALLY enjoy that kiss
25-11-2017T17:04:59,MuonNeutrino,"note it got picked by TOM, not the voters, and it was specifically a crossover with a thing he's sketched before"
25-11-2017T17:05:02,FieryPenguin,sych passion XD
25-11-2017T17:05:05,FieryPenguin,such
25-11-2017T17:05:05,WereKeidran,bsck
25-11-2017T17:05:07,BadFoMo,Vote or another Artist's Choice?
25-11-2017T17:05:11,MuonNeutrino,tom pick
25-11-2017T17:05:18,PalmettoPathfinder1,Still a crossover (even if it's a Tom Pick)
25-11-2017T17:05:21,unsteddyphoenix,"Also this DOES make sense, theres clearly a relation here."
25-11-2017T17:05:39,MuonNeutrino,"yes, but it's not relevant to the question of coming up with crossover suggestions the voters would like"
25-11-2017T17:05:45,Xexanoth,"should be vote, unless Tom is now up for the Nora one"
25-11-2017T17:06:09,unsteddyphoenix,Tom should just pick them all for now imo.
25-11-2017T17:06:19,PalmettoPathfinder1,I wonder: has anyone forfeited his request winning?
25-11-2017T17:06:26,MidnightBlue78,i second that
25-11-2017T17:06:38,Serpentfrog,"Why would they, Palm?"
25-11-2017T17:06:42,Bgrmystr2,"normally, the voted one would be next, but this may not be a normal stream."
25-11-2017T17:07:01,BadFoMo,//Troll Pick ALL the the requests!
25-11-2017T17:07:03,MuonNeutrino,i like the contrast in this one between fidget's more humanoid body shape and nibs the regular squirrel ^^
25-11-2017T17:07:37,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Well, say someone who's request won, but he/she felt bad about the request he beat and felt that it was a better request than his/her own request so they decided to forfeit."
25-11-2017T17:07:49,Bgrmystr2,that's not really a thing palm
25-11-2017T17:07:49,Byzantinefire,I wish i knew about this earlier.
25-11-2017T17:08:00,PalmettoPathfinder1,It could happen.
25-11-2017T17:08:05,ChromeDragon24,X doubt
25-11-2017T17:08:09,MuonNeutrino,"i suppose it could happen, but i certainly don't remember seeing it occur"
25-11-2017T17:08:10,MidnightBlue78,i wouldnt forfeit my suggestion
25-11-2017T17:08:22,BadFoMo,Same.
25-11-2017T17:08:24,MuonNeutrino,i would expect it'd be quite unlikely
25-11-2017T17:08:25,Bgrmystr2,happen here though? With this specific setup? Unlikely
25-11-2017T17:08:25,Wooffin,Coffee~
25-11-2017T17:08:31,Xexanoth,@Palmetto often people who win aren't even in the Chat
25-11-2017T17:08:34,Bgrmystr2,"because it's what the chat wants, or what tom wants."
25-11-2017T17:08:37,Serpentfrog,My suggestions are the best and therefore that is impossible.
25-11-2017T17:08:42,DarthKeidran,What was the first sketch?
25-11-2017T17:08:44,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Being the nice guy that I am, if given the chance I would forfeit"
25-11-2017T17:08:45,unsteddyphoenix,Ay same
25-11-2017T17:08:47,Bgrmystr2,one person does not get to deny the vote.
25-11-2017T17:08:49,Byzantinefire,Never seen a Picarto channel this full before.
25-11-2017T17:08:51,tehbear,this is the first
25-11-2017T17:08:52,ChromeDragon24,this one dart
25-11-2017T17:08:58,BadFoMo,@DarthKeidran That was it.
25-11-2017T17:08:59,DarthKeidran,"Oh, Nevermind"
25-11-2017T17:09:01,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I'm too bias to give up on my suggestions
25-11-2017T17:09:10,ThingsAreMoving,Byzanthine this is the norm here
25-11-2017T17:09:13,Serpentfrog,"Try Twitch sometime, Fire."
25-11-2017T17:09:15,Bgrmystr2,"you likely wouldn't make any change to it, cuz the votes are what tom draws, Palm xD"
25-11-2017T17:09:15,Wooffin,Marv lets be bias together!
25-11-2017T17:09:15,DarthKeidran,Time to see the tom's pick of the day. Unless that was it.
25-11-2017T17:09:27,Xexanoth,"technicially there was a vote for the Nora as Human one, but Tom didn't feel up to"
25-11-2017T17:09:32,MuonNeutrino,@darth that previous one was a tom pick
25-11-2017T17:09:38,RandomTKLover,Y no vote?
25-11-2017T17:09:42,BaudelaireGaudi,Mew
25-11-2017T17:09:49,Bgrmystr2,"Because there was a vote before that one, Random"
25-11-2017T17:09:51,BaudelaireGaudi,Next Random.Rand
25-11-2017T17:09:54,BaudelaireGaudi,?
25-11-2017T17:09:58,MarvTheHugPharaoh,if there was a vote TKbot will say so
25-11-2017T17:10:03,Serpentfrog,"Because you're not a legal citizen, Random."
25-11-2017T17:10:04,DarthKeidran,"I would have voted, but due to fan art I'm working on, I goofed and forgot to check for a vote."
25-11-2017T17:10:06,MuonNeutrino,"@randomtklover given that tom hasn't been feeling well lately, he may not do things the usual way"
25-11-2017T17:10:35,MviluUatusun,"Oh, who is Mrs. Nibbly getting all chummy with here."
25-11-2017T17:10:41,Serpentfrog,Fidget.
25-11-2017T17:10:41,MarvTheHugPharaoh,fidget
25-11-2017T17:10:46,Byzantinefire,I guess Twokinds would be too busy for being a contestant in an art contest.

25-11-2017T17:10:50,Bgrmystr2,"lol, a bit late on the stream, Mvilu?"

25-11-2017T17:11:05,MviluUatusun,"Well, I've been busy with laundry."

25-11-2017T17:13:37,Serpentfrog,No links.
25-11-2017T17:13:41,Bgrmystr2,I don't think Maddie is capable of causing mischief on Nora's scale
25-11-2017T17:13:44,MuonNeutrino,"uhhh, if it's not a link to something of tom's, you're not supposed to post it"

25-11-2017T21:18:44,Dadrobit,"Seems I didn't miss too much, looks like Tom ended not long after I left."
25-11-2017T21:24:20,Ordithus,"Yeah, Tom was pretty worn out.  Apparently he was pretty ill this last week.  Poor guy."
25-11-2017T21:25:13,Dadrobit,"Yeah, been that way since last week. Couldn't finish last Saturday and wasn't up for Friday either. Rough stuff."
25-11-2017T21:27:13,CrRAR,yay for recordings.
25-11-2017T21:27:32,CrRAR,def a lot of cute stuff tonight.

25-11-2017T21:29:38,CrRAR,See ya Ord!
25-11-2017T21:37:39,unsteddyphoenix,Tom was in the mood for kyoot I guess
25-11-2017T21:40:09,CrRAR,indeed haha
25-11-2017T21:43:10,CrRAR,"I like that the Kat/Slave Leia one finally got done, it's gooooood."
25-11-2017T21:44:04,qwe304,did he finish the nora one?
25-11-2017T21:44:39,unsteddyphoenix,"I can always appreciate some choice Kat, even if we're a bit young to feel the...affection other starwars fans have for it"
25-11-2017T21:44:55,unsteddyphoenix,Nah he didnt finish it but he probably will.
25-11-2017T21:45:05,unsteddyphoenix,Seemed like it was mostly done
25-11-2017T21:46:59,CrRAR,What was the humanoid Nora suggestion?
25-11-2017T21:48:23,CrRAR,Or is that Sera who knocked the table over?
25-11-2017T21:48:38,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah the humanoid nora
25-11-2017T21:48:49,unsteddyphoenix,acting very unnoralike
25-11-2017T21:49:16,CrRAR,Being clumsy and crashing parties?
25-11-2017T21:49:56,RandomTKLover,"Just finished watching the stream from 11/23, is he remastering all the previous chapters?"
25-11-2017T21:50:12,CrRAR,Working on Book 4
25-11-2017T21:50:13,Dadrobit,It's for the book print
25-11-2017T21:50:48,RandomTKLover,"Ohh, its only for the book"
25-11-2017T21:51:58,RandomTKLover,That’s sad
25-11-2017T21:52:29,Dadrobit,He created a new page so that the intro to book 4 wouldn't be so awkward. Otherwise the first page would be http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/445/ with no context.
25-11-2017T21:53:52,RandomTKLover,That page was already in the book
25-11-2017T21:54:37,RandomTKLover,Ohh wait
25-11-2017T21:54:44,RandomTKLover,I see
25-11-2017T21:55:14,RandomTKLover,My brain is just slow because i’m tired
25-11-2017T21:55:25,Dadrobit,That's my default
25-11-2017T21:56:43,RandomTKLover,"I wish he would go back and remaster it, but that would be a lot to ask of him"
25-11-2017T21:58:57,RandomTKLover,"Well, I’m going to bed before I pass out. G’night all.:ptv-sleepy:"
25-11-2017T21:58:58,Dadrobit,They actually have been. Twice now
25-11-2017T21:59:00,Dadrobit,o/
25-11-2017T21:59:38,RandomTKLover,What does /o mean
25-11-2017T21:59:52,RandomTKLover,Or whatever it was
25-11-2017T22:00:38,RandomTKLover,"And, im out"
25-11-2017T22:00:44,CrRAR,see ya
25-11-2017T22:01:00,RandomTKLover,:ptv-laugh::ptv-sleepy:
25-11-2017T22:01:03,Bgrmystr2,"It's a wave, Random ._."
25-11-2017T22:01:17,Bgrmystr2,"the head of the person, and their arm in the air"
25-11-2017T22:01:26,Bgrmystr2,are emoticons that difficult?
25-11-2017T22:01:30,Bgrmystr2,o.O
25-11-2017T22:02:09,Bgrmystr2,Not that he'll ever know considering he ran off.
25-11-2017T22:07:35,PalmettoPathfinder1,"You know, I wonder if Tom would ever draw a Kilrathi.  Of course, the females have six breasts."
25-11-2017T22:07:39,PalmettoPathfinder1,;P
25-11-2017T22:07:51,unsteddyphoenix,just like keidran
25-11-2017T22:08:03,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Actually, they really do have six breasts!"
25-11-2017T22:20:24,Dadrobit,"Whoa, Firefox changed."
25-11-2017T22:21:54,Dadrobit,"Just downloaded the update finally, things are different. Chaaaaange....."
25-11-2017T22:27:11,JackeryTheWinter,awwwww just got here....
25-11-2017T22:29:22,Bgrmystr2,why.. would you get the update?
25-11-2017T22:29:26,Bgrmystr2,just why? xD
25-11-2017T22:29:45,Bgrmystr2,"Soon as the update hit me, I noped the fuck out when I realized they removed everything that allowed customization"
25-11-2017T22:29:49,Bgrmystr2,all the APIs
25-11-2017T22:29:59,Bgrmystr2,and rolled back to the previous version
25-11-2017T22:38:46,Dadrobit,"My computer did a forced update for windows which closed my browser. Then when I reopened FF, it auto-updated that. Probably going to go back myself."
25-11-2017T22:39:37,Bgrmystr2,"It's pretty easily honestly. Just download the exe for  56.0.2, save the browser profile elsewhere just in case, and install the old version on top of the updated version"
25-11-2017T22:39:42,Bgrmystr2,then just disable updates xD
25-11-2017T22:39:49,Bgrmystr2,"for the browser version itself, anyway"
25-11-2017T22:39:56,Bgrmystr2,"otherwise, it'll update all over again."
