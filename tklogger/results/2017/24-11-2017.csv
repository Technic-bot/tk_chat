24-11-2017T00:00:11,Bgrmystr2,"I have it set to ""Do nothing"""
24-11-2017T00:00:16,Bgrmystr2,so it doesn't lower volume
24-11-2017T00:00:42,Bgrmystr2,"If it's already set to that, then there's something else that could be doing the same thing."
24-11-2017T00:00:58,Bgrmystr2,But I never did find out what it was
24-11-2017T00:01:42,Bgrmystr2,"It affected my system for a few months, I played with all sorts of audio settings, and nothing worked, but then about a week of not changing anthing, it stopped"
24-11-2017T00:02:05,Bgrmystr2,super weird stuff :thinking:
24-11-2017T00:02:21,ZRO4825,skype I believe has that option in its settings as well
24-11-2017T00:02:27,Bgrmystr2,"hm, does it?"
24-11-2017T00:02:30,Bgrmystr2,lemmy look
24-11-2017T00:03:35,Bgrmystr2,"not seeing it offhand, might have been the thing I remember fighting with"
24-11-2017T00:05:30,Bgrmystr2,yeah everything online says that skype relies on the communications tab in sound settings for that.
24-11-2017T00:08:41,Bgrmystr2,This whole time Ron's stream had been paused ffffff :ptv-shock:
24-11-2017T00:08:57,Nekonny,XD
24-11-2017T00:09:29,ZRO4825,"Good old random pausing of Picarto strikes again, eh?"
24-11-2017T00:09:46,Bgrmystr2,It paused again within 30 seconds
24-11-2017T00:09:51,Bgrmystr2,something is up with it
24-11-2017T00:09:57,Bgrmystr2,&gt;;/
24-11-2017T00:12:31,Tharkis,"Nekonny's stream randomly pauses for me if i'm watching other streams in the same window, i gota watch nchan in the corner to notice"
24-11-2017T00:12:45,Tharkis,"when he's solo though it never happens to me, so it must be on my end not his =D"
24-11-2017T00:13:05,SageSaga,i havent had a stream pause yet
24-11-2017T00:13:25,SageSaga,its pretty common for me for one to stop when i have 4 going
24-11-2017T00:13:43,Bgrmystr2,"I recently upgraded to a 100mbit line, so there's no excuse on my internet speed's end"

24-11-2017T01:39:13,unsteddyphoenix,:thinking:
24-11-2017T01:40:02,Kagiyama89,:thinking: because I only played Sonic 2 when I was young and tails looked a bit feminine
24-11-2017T01:40:18,Kagiyama89,and games always had male + female main characters
24-11-2017T01:40:44,Kagiyama89,is that shadow

24-11-2017T02:50:40,ZRO4825,And occasionally I pull my mind out of the gutter for a change of pace!
24-11-2017T02:50:41,HyperTheFox,just....playing ultra sun. havent got through with it yet
24-11-2017T02:52:30,Bgrmystr2,Same story for me with Path of Exile
24-11-2017T02:52:45,ZRO4825,Does one truly get /through/ a game such as PoE? :thinking:
24-11-2017T02:53:16,HyperTheFox,path to exile?
24-11-2017T02:53:23,ZRO4825,Path of Exile
24-11-2017T02:53:35,ZRO4825,it's a free to play Isometric view RPG in the vein of Diablo and such
24-11-2017T02:53:35,HyperTheFox,...wuts that?
24-11-2017T02:53:44,Bgrmystr2,Path of Exile does have an ending
24-11-2017T02:53:59,Bgrmystr2,"just like Diablo, and D2, and D3"
24-11-2017T02:54:33,ZRO4825,"but Diablo series is never truly finished. Always with the changing and the builds, and the improving and the farming o_o"
24-11-2017T02:54:37,HyperTheFox,never heard of it
24-11-2017T02:54:38,SageSaga,"Path of Exile, 1 white mana instant, exile target creature, that player may search their library for a basic land and put it into play tapped"
24-11-2017T02:54:45,ZRO4825,^ win
24-11-2017T02:55:36,SageSaga,some things you never forget- why do i remember magic cards?
24-11-2017T02:55:38,Bgrmystr2,"What PoE did, instead of giving a ""New game Plus"" like many other games did, they make the journey back to there part of the story continued after you left."
24-11-2017T02:56:13,ZRO4825,"Because some M:TG cards are awesome, that's why, Sage"
24-11-2017T02:56:26,ZRO4825,"I used to have one for some Angel...remembered her for years, finally can't quite remember anymore though..."
24-11-2017T02:56:35,ZRO4825,I blame my age
24-11-2017T02:56:40,HyperTheFox,"anyways, atm doing second trial with an evolved....whatever rockruff is"
24-11-2017T02:56:45,Bgrmystr2,"lol Hyper, Diablo is one of those games that defined genres"
24-11-2017T02:56:59,Bgrmystr2,not the first of it's kind
24-11-2017T02:57:05,ZRO4825,I think he meant that he hadn't heard of PoE :P
24-11-2017T02:57:10,Bgrmystr2,but definitely one that made such a big impression
24-11-2017T02:57:23,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno, it was open to interpretation :P"
24-11-2017T02:57:32,HyperTheFox,yeah never heard of poe
24-11-2017T02:57:48,ZRO4825,"Well you're always free to interpret things different, just doesn't make for a guarantee that you'll be correct =D"
24-11-2017T02:57:56,Bgrmystr2,"Nor you, sir."
24-11-2017T02:57:59,Bgrmystr2,But still
24-11-2017T02:58:01,ZRO4825,I agree ^_^
24-11-2017T02:58:31,Bgrmystr2,Path of Exile is considered by many to be a spiritual successor to Diablo 2
24-11-2017T02:58:44,Bgrmystr2,similar to the likes of Torchlight 2
24-11-2017T02:59:01,HyperTheFox,Oh crud! a giant pokemon spider
24-11-2017T02:59:04,HyperTheFox,....water spider
24-11-2017T02:59:16,Bgrmystr2,hit it with a newspaper?
24-11-2017T02:59:16,ZRO4825,"damnit, that's going to annoy me now till I remember what that angel card was"
24-11-2017T02:59:27,ZRO4825,"She wasn't a normal angel, iirc....but I can't remember what she was &gt;_&lt;;"
24-11-2017T02:59:34,SageSaga,what did it do?
24-11-2017T03:00:02,ZRO4825,I wish I could remember at this point
24-11-2017T03:00:04,Bgrmystr2,"lol zro. Rely on sage, the one who remembers MTG cards for no reason other than reasons"
24-11-2017T03:00:12,SageSaga,Serah Angel is the most famous
24-11-2017T03:00:20,ZRO4825,I haven't been able to find my MTG cards for about 3 residence moves now
24-11-2017T03:00:31,ZRO4825,That doesn't sound familiar
24-11-2017T03:00:43,HyperTheFox,zap it with shocks
24-11-2017T03:00:49,ZRO4825,"This one, the one of her I had, she had I think white hair, was leaning over a guy on the battleground or something"
24-11-2017T03:01:03,ZRO4825,"Like, I vaguely remember the artwork at this point, but can't recall squat other than that"
24-11-2017T03:01:21,ZRO4825,Which I realize helps for just about naught
24-11-2017T03:01:53,ZRO4825,It would've been a card from like...early 2000s at best
24-11-2017T03:02:32,SageSaga,well its not Akroma
24-11-2017T03:02:53,SageSaga,she had Purple hair
24-11-2017T03:02:57,SageSaga,hotie
24-11-2017T03:03:17,ZRO4825,"Just found her...she DOES sound familiar...I might've had her too at some point, but I don't think she's the one I""m thinking of"
24-11-2017T03:03:45,SageSaga,Avacyn?
24-11-2017T03:03:58,SageSaga,she had white hair
24-11-2017T03:04:13,ZRO4825,Nein
24-11-2017T03:04:26,ZRO4825,Hopefully I'm not misremembering the hair...
24-11-2017T03:04:27,SageSaga,well not Iona
24-11-2017T03:06:36,ZRO4825,"Well it's not what I'm looking for, but holy crap that effect on Sunblast Angel :rofl:"
24-11-2017T03:06:50,ZRO4825,"""When Sunblast Angel enters the battlefield, destroy all tapped creatures."""
24-11-2017T03:07:26,ZRO4825,"And just did a search for ""angel"" on the MTG page from wizards and didn't see what I'm thinking of"
24-11-2017T03:07:34,ZRO4825,I may just be remembering too many details wrong &gt;:(
24-11-2017T03:07:43,SageSaga,im not sure it was a creature
24-11-2017T03:08:02,ZRO4825,There's a chance it might not have been
24-11-2017T03:08:25,Bgrmystr2,Are you sure it was an angel? Perhaps it maybe said angel in the description or something?
24-11-2017T03:08:36,ZRO4825,I might be thinking of an item that just had one of the angel characters on it in the flavor text or something
24-11-2017T03:08:57,SageSaga,Iona's Judgement?
24-11-2017T03:09:32,ZRO4825,"Nah, that's wasn't it"
24-11-2017T03:09:40,ZRO4825,that*
24-11-2017T03:10:42,ZRO4825,"That's it...searching the whole database now on wizards, because this is gonna bug me now that I'm on it."
24-11-2017T03:10:55,ZRO4825,"wish these pictures were just a bit bigger though, yeesh, what'd they design this site for, ants?"
24-11-2017T03:11:13,SageSaga,set it to visual spoiler?
24-11-2017T03:12:29,SageSaga,https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/gamelore/images/b/bb/Phage_vs._Akroma.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130530161255
24-11-2017T03:12:45,SageSaga,Akroma was awesome- so awesome i read the books- then they ruined her
24-11-2017T03:13:11,ZRO4825,....doh
24-11-2017T03:13:24,ZRO4825,I feel like it WAS Akroma on the card...but it wasn't Akroma's card...
24-11-2017T03:13:34,SageSaga,they gave her like the body of a lion and made her like a sphinx angel
24-11-2017T03:13:41,ZRO4825,&lt;_&gt;;; da hell?
24-11-2017T03:14:13,SageSaga,oh and she was mechanical or something? man its been a long time
24-11-2017T03:14:45,ZRO4825,double da hell? lol
24-11-2017T03:15:01,ZRO4825,FOUND IT!!!
24-11-2017T03:15:10,ZRO4825,Convalescent Care

24-11-2017T03:15:57,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: doesn't have white hair
24-11-2017T03:15:59,SageSaga,yep
24-11-2017T03:16:01,ZRO4825,Just that image stuck with me for the LONGEST damned time

24-11-2017T03:18:32,ZRO4825,"Well, at least Akroma stuck out in my mind? :rofl:"
24-11-2017T03:18:43,ZRO4825,"That IS her on the card, if I'm lookin at that right, lol"
24-11-2017T03:19:03,SageSaga,http://www.abugames.com/images/products/gradedlegionscards/21224122.jpg
24-11-2017T03:19:10,SageSaga,i used to cast her on turn 4
24-11-2017T03:19:11,Bgrmystr2,Can't be. Doesn't have white hair.  :ptv-laugh:
24-11-2017T03:19:42,ZRO4825,"Bgr, I'mma stick you in Yukari's thigh gap you keep it up :P"
24-11-2017T03:19:47,Bgrmystr2,LOLOL
24-11-2017T03:20:07,MarvTheHugPharaoh,-_-
24-11-2017T03:20:36,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: I'm not sure if I would enjoy that or fear that.
24-11-2017T03:20:45,ZRO4825,I believe the answer is yes.
24-11-2017T03:20:57,Bgrmystr2,You're right. The answer is yes. xD
24-11-2017T03:21:14,SageSaga,i started playing MTG Online
24-11-2017T03:22:25,sunblaze,nyna looks insanely ferocious! neat
24-11-2017T03:22:35,SageSaga,hey Sunblaze
24-11-2017T03:22:36,ZRO4825,"btw Sage, ty for the advice of working on a vector layer for lines"
24-11-2017T03:22:41,sunblaze,hey
24-11-2017T03:22:42,ZRO4825,That makes shit SO much easier to trim at times
24-11-2017T03:23:24,ZRO4825,I have made a mistake...I opened a page for mods for Skyrim
24-11-2017T03:23:29,ZRO4825,must avoid going back down that path....
24-11-2017T03:23:38,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"no, stay on the path"
24-11-2017T03:23:53,MarvTheHugPharaoh,let it keep you up for hours
24-11-2017T03:23:54,Bgrmystr2,yes.. the path.. to becoming an exile? :V
24-11-2017T03:24:02,ZRO4825,I've got like 300+ hours into that game and I think maybe only a third of that was actually PLAYING the damned game! XD
24-11-2017T03:24:26,MarvTheHugPharaoh,thems rookie numbers
24-11-2017T03:24:27,Bgrmystr2,hey 100 hours of a base game is pretty good imo
24-11-2017T03:24:34,MarvTheHugPharaoh,gotta get those hours up
24-11-2017T03:24:36,Bgrmystr2,Marv's right tho
24-11-2017T03:24:40,SageSaga,http://ft.trillian.im/7341912faba1e920e6f0122f2799e355b3a2189d/6VcyEPDwnf1F4zkbO4hSOuOKPD5IZ.jpg
24-11-2017T03:24:50,ZRO4825,They are rookie number Marv. And I'm trying to keep them that way when I've still got 700+ other games to play through. :rofl:
24-11-2017T03:25:02,sunblaze,I know the feeling. there is an update for a 10 year old game -&gt; titanquest since lasdt week. right now I am isntalling mods :D
24-11-2017T03:25:40,ZRO4825,TQ's sudden update came out of like freaking nowhere o_o
24-11-2017T03:25:51,sunblaze,no kidding. but I still like it
24-11-2017T03:25:58,ZRO4825,"I used to play that game a good bit back in the day, it was a good Diablo successor imo."
24-11-2017T03:26:14,ZRO4825,"Lost some flair over the years, but still a good hack-n-slash."
24-11-2017T03:27:03,ZRO4825,"I'm trying to dissect that screen Sage, lol. I can see that you won, but I don't recognize enough of what else is going on :o"
24-11-2017T03:27:12,sunblaze,but it is a bit ironic that THQ nordic is making a Ragnarok update.... but cool :D
24-11-2017T03:27:27,SageSaga,well that stack is the important part- and 3 cards in play
24-11-2017T03:28:09,SageSaga,"basically - Trespassers curse says ""When an opponent has a creature come into play under their control- that player looses 1 life and you gain 1 life"""
24-11-2017T03:28:23,ZRO4825,Oh god...and Dowsing Dagger forces them to create creatures...
24-11-2017T03:28:39,SageSaga,"2 artifacts in play say ""Come into play effects are doubled"""
24-11-2017T03:28:53,ZRO4825,O_O;;;
24-11-2017T03:29:03,ZRO4825,"Holy crap, no wonder the guy gave up XD"
24-11-2017T03:29:13,SageSaga,so - he was going to lose 81 life and i would gain 81 life- and i had another one in my hand to do it again
24-11-2017T03:29:27,ZRO4825,Jeeeeeeeez
24-11-2017T03:29:37,Bgrmystr2,oh fuck
24-11-2017T03:29:43,Bgrmystr2,how much life is there total lol
24-11-2017T03:29:45,ZRO4825,"That's one of those points of greatness and frustration in Magic, is you can set up shit like that, lol"
24-11-2017T03:29:47,ZRO4825,"20, iirc"
24-11-2017T03:29:49,SageSaga,you start with 20
24-11-2017T03:29:50,ZRO4825,is what you start at at least
24-11-2017T03:29:54,Bgrmystr2,..oh
24-11-2017T03:30:02,Bgrmystr2,"wait, if he loses all 20 life, he would have lost anyway, eh"
24-11-2017T03:30:03,Bgrmystr2,?
24-11-2017T03:30:06,ZRO4825,Yup
24-11-2017T03:30:12,Bgrmystr2,so.. ow
24-11-2017T03:30:37,SageSaga,the best part is-
24-11-2017T03:30:42,Bgrmystr2,I don't think there's any coming back from that lol
24-11-2017T03:30:50,SageSaga,in that particular circumstance- he though he was safe
24-11-2017T03:31:16,SageSaga,because he had a card that took my curse - and made it so i couldnt play that card at all
24-11-2017T03:31:55,SageSaga,and i used a bounce spell to get rid of his enchantment holding it hostage- so it was in his hand to cast again... but it was still my turn...
24-11-2017T03:32:00,SageSaga,so he didnt get a chance
24-11-2017T03:32:33,Bgrmystr2,rip
24-11-2017T03:32:53,SageSaga,"its kinda like taking someones gun and the guy being like ""Its ok- you can hold on to it"" and then when its time to die I suddenly go ""Btw- I got my gun back"" ""NANI?!"" *Bang*"
24-11-2017T03:33:14,ZRO4825,XD
24-11-2017T03:34:08,Bgrmystr2,this is the part where sage drifts sideways out of the room xD
24-11-2017T03:34:19,Bgrmystr2,with no leg movement physics
24-11-2017T03:34:27,Bgrmystr2,cuz that's the best shit xD
24-11-2017T03:34:59,SageSaga,so i keep getting so hype for MHW that i keep looking at how much a PS4 Pro costs- even though im not going to buy one
24-11-2017T03:36:09,ZRO4825,lol
24-11-2017T03:36:18,ZRO4825,"Waiting on PC release, aye?"
24-11-2017T03:37:04,SageSaga,yeah
24-11-2017T03:37:21,SageSaga,which is kinda funny because the person i most want to play with- wont get the game
24-11-2017T03:37:38,ZRO4825,well....that sucks
24-11-2017T03:38:17,SageSaga,"yeah, but there are plenty of others I'd like to play with"
24-11-2017T03:38:34,ZRO4825,I've only ever played the MHU3 Demo for 3DS
24-11-2017T03:38:48,ZRO4825,"Seemed interesting, and looking at some World gameplay has been really nifty"
24-11-2017T03:38:48,SageSaga,i dont know what weapons im going to main O_O
24-11-2017T03:39:00,MarvTheHugPharaoh,a very tiny toothpic
24-11-2017T03:39:16,ZRO4825,"So, in the case of Monster Hunter weapons, you mean a 6-foot long broadsword? :P"
24-11-2017T03:41:08,SageSaga,like- Bows looks freakn awesome- but so do the light bow guns
24-11-2017T03:41:35,SageSaga,"but i also love Sword and Shield... and Great Sword, the new long sword looks like a ton of fun"
24-11-2017T03:41:56,SageSaga,and charge blade was my best friend for MH4U
24-11-2017T03:42:55,Bgrmystr2,Who did you want to play with? :o
24-11-2017T03:43:17,SageSaga,Mihari
24-11-2017T03:43:50,Bgrmystr2,She doesn't want to get it?
24-11-2017T03:43:54,Bgrmystr2,:{
24-11-2017T03:44:28,SageSaga,she loved MHGen too much because of the Palicos and this game doesnt let you play as Palicos
24-11-2017T03:44:38,ZRO4825,awww
24-11-2017T03:44:43,ZRO4825,Maybe later as DLC?
24-11-2017T03:45:20,SageSaga,nah they are fundamentally different- very unlikely
24-11-2017T03:45:38,ZRO4825,"Oh. Wasn't sure what a Palicos was to start with, so just takin a stab in the dark there :o"
24-11-2017T03:46:37,SageSaga,Palicos are your Cat hunting pals
24-11-2017T03:47:11,ZRO4825,"awww, that'd be cool"
24-11-2017T03:47:26,ZRO4825,And MHGen actually let you play AS them?
24-11-2017T03:48:11,Bgrmystr2,"Ahh, was that the whole.. them adding the cats as a side-thing to keep around as a companion?"
24-11-2017T03:48:32,Bgrmystr2,cuz I remember you guys talking about that
24-11-2017T03:48:56,SageSaga,the cats are still AI companions to help gather and hunt in the game
24-11-2017T03:49:02,SageSaga,but you cant play AS a cat
24-11-2017T03:49:05,Bgrmystr2,yeah
24-11-2017T03:49:11,Bgrmystr2,that's RIP
24-11-2017T03:49:27,Bgrmystr2,is the game online only? or can you play offline?
24-11-2017T03:49:46,SageSaga,its solo and online
24-11-2017T03:49:56,Bgrmystr2,double rip
24-11-2017T03:50:03,SageSaga,?
24-11-2017T03:50:32,Bgrmystr2,"if it was an offline-based game with online play, I was expecting modders to do something about it"
24-11-2017T03:50:38,Bgrmystr2,since they love that kinda challenge
24-11-2017T03:50:47,Bgrmystr2,"but if it's online only, then none of that's gonna be happening"
24-11-2017T03:51:27,SageSaga,i just said its solo and online
24-11-2017T03:51:40,SageSaga,that means its not online only
24-11-2017T03:51:52,SageSaga,that being said- modding wouldnt fly well
24-11-2017T03:52:20,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: Does it? I figured you meant it was generally a solo-based game played online. Kind of like D3 is
24-11-2017T03:52:28,Bgrmystr2,"you play solo, but it's still online only"
24-11-2017T03:53:08,SageSaga,no - its drop in multiplayer- or you can just not have anyone ever join you
24-11-2017T03:53:18,Bgrmystr2,hm
24-11-2017T03:54:00,Bgrmystr2,"Well, as long as the game doesn't have to connect to a server for you to be able to play, then modders will still mess with it"
24-11-2017T03:54:12,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, they'll mess with stuff regardless, but yknow"
24-11-2017T03:54:57,SageSaga,yeah but doing that- is pointless for the MH players - modding it is basically a sin
24-11-2017T03:55:40,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-wondering: that's very strange. Why is that a thing?
24-11-2017T03:56:21,Bgrmystr2,I've never heard of that kind of thing before.
24-11-2017T03:56:38,SageSaga,if the modding was 100% cosmetic- its not a big deal
24-11-2017T03:57:50,Bgrmystr2,as long as it doesn't affect other people and only affecting people in their own playthroughs.
24-11-2017T03:58:11,SageSaga,But MH is at its core a team co-op game about overcoming the challenge of taking down a massive powerful monster
24-11-2017T03:58:23,Bgrmystr2,hm
24-11-2017T04:00:19,SageSaga,people can be competitive with what team or what solo player can defeat a creature the fastest with challenges imposed on themselves
24-11-2017T04:00:44,SageSaga,soon as you mod something- it becomes unfair- comparing your playthrough with mods to mind without is not the same
24-11-2017T04:01:08,SageSaga,anywho- im done folks!
24-11-2017T04:01:15,SageSaga,take care im turning off the stream
24-11-2017T04:01:19,sunblaze,ok take care
24-11-2017T04:01:32,SageSaga,gonna color this at 3pm EST
24-11-2017T04:01:34,Bgrmystr2,well yeah you shouldn't be comparing the two in the first place. xD
24-11-2017T04:01:35,SageSaga,11 hours from now

24-11-2017T15:54:16,Tharkis,because everyone knows the innanity of your statements increases with your proximity to cats
24-11-2017T15:54:24,Tharkis,XKCD did a comic about that
24-11-2017T15:56:01,Tharkis,xkcd comic 231 =)
24-11-2017T15:56:58,w0lfmare,:cw0lfmare-HeadEmber:
24-11-2017T15:57:06,w0lfmare,Hello everyone
24-11-2017T15:57:15,SageSaga,yo w0lf
24-11-2017T15:57:49,Bgrmystr2,heya w0lf
24-11-2017T15:58:04,SageSaga,i need to take a break and cook some lunch
24-11-2017T15:58:20,FoxxTrotter,"Hey, w0lf."
24-11-2017T16:23:59,SageSaga,food is cooked- meds are taken-
24-11-2017T16:24:24,SageSaga,ouch- ok food is still very hot
24-11-2017T16:26:01,sunblaze,now thats one surprised catgirl :D
24-11-2017T16:26:11,sunblaze,and pissed off ...
24-11-2017T16:27:02,Bgrmystr2,"ehh, just angry"
24-11-2017T16:27:08,Bgrmystr2,don't think pissed off levels quite yet
24-11-2017T16:27:25,sunblaze,yeah thats for the next comic
24-11-2017T16:37:59,Bgrmystr2,"jesus, you think that shine is bright enough?"
24-11-2017T16:38:42,SageSaga,you think i need to turn down a flash bomb?
24-11-2017T16:39:02,sunblaze,she is throwing a flashbang? cool :D
24-11-2017T16:39:09,Bgrmystr2,looks more like it's coming off the sword to me? :thinking:
24-11-2017T16:39:16,w0lfmare,Turn it into a glowbomb :cw0lfmare-HeadSil:
24-11-2017T16:39:52,Bgrmystr2,"but yeah, flash bombs are kinda bright xD"
24-11-2017T16:39:55,SageSaga,let me show ya something then-
24-11-2017T16:40:16,SageSaga,sword is there
24-11-2017T16:40:28,SageSaga,focal point of the burst?
24-11-2017T16:40:53,Bgrmystr2,"yeah below the sword, I didn't understand that either xD"
24-11-2017T16:41:04,Bgrmystr2,why would there be flash bombs in such a setting?
24-11-2017T16:41:04,sunblaze,more like the forrestfloor yes
24-11-2017T16:41:23,SageSaga,now look at her arm
24-11-2017T16:41:32,sunblaze,why not? the AI setting is a fantasy setting in a virtual world made kind real
24-11-2017T16:41:42,sunblaze,technology is a possibility
24-11-2017T16:41:50,Bgrmystr2,because fantasy doesn't usually include technology
24-11-2017T16:42:03,Bgrmystr2,otherwise it's not exactly fantasy anymore :thinking:
24-11-2017T16:42:07,sunblaze,tell that to the steampunkers
24-11-2017T16:42:20,w0lfmare,Light magic of course
24-11-2017T16:42:49,Bgrmystr2,"xD steampunk isn't really fantasy though. Steam is a legitimate resource, and we use it for lots of things"
24-11-2017T16:43:09,SageSaga,have you seen how steampunk uses steam?
24-11-2017T16:43:30,SageSaga,they use it for generating lasers
24-11-2017T16:43:36,SageSaga,in portable laser guns
24-11-2017T16:43:55,Bgrmystr2,it's just bigass steam engines attached to stuff. :thinking:
24-11-2017T16:43:56,sunblaze,and 100 feet robots with a steam engine
24-11-2017T16:44:07,w0lfmare,Excessive gears and such
24-11-2017T16:44:31,SageSaga,besides- DnD has flash bombs
24-11-2017T16:44:46,Bgrmystr2,"I would consider steampunk less fantasy and more scifi. Realism isn't exclusive, really. :u"
24-11-2017T16:44:50,SageSaga,alchemical bombs
24-11-2017T16:45:01,SageSaga,lots of steam punk uses magic too
24-11-2017T16:45:17,SageSaga,regardless- alchemy is a thing in most fantasy games
24-11-2017T16:45:17,Bgrmystr2,Haven't seen any xD
24-11-2017T16:45:50,Bgrmystr2,"Magic in steam punk, I mean/"
24-11-2017T16:45:55,sunblaze,play arcanum
24-11-2017T16:46:14,Bgrmystr2,presuming I knew what that was :v
24-11-2017T16:46:18,sunblaze,love my timemage with an elephant gun :D
24-11-2017T16:46:44,Bgrmystr2,it.. is a city in ohio
24-11-2017T16:46:49,Bgrmystr2,thanks internet.
24-11-2017T16:47:09,SageSaga,"Bgr, you gotta understand that just because you have never seen or heard about something doesnt mean it cant be a thing"
24-11-2017T16:47:21,sunblaze,sierra game from 2001
24-11-2017T16:47:40,sunblaze,50% magic and 50% tech both fighting for rulership kinda.
24-11-2017T16:47:43,Bgrmystr2,"I'm not saying it can't be a thing, I'm just saying I didn't understand because I've never seen it before."
24-11-2017T16:48:29,SageSaga,"so when you saw an airplane for the first time in your life you were like ""Impossible! Metal cant fly!"""
24-11-2017T16:48:46,Bgrmystr2,lol no?
24-11-2017T16:49:03,sunblaze,or you were a geek and thought superman sure has some STRANGE pants :D
24-11-2017T16:49:35,Bgrmystr2,"I love all of these exclamations you make of me, though, sage. XD I always get a kick out of em. :ptv-laugh:"
24-11-2017T16:49:54,SageSaga,then why assume a fantasy world with magic - cant also have tech or alchemy - especially when in the comic i literally reference a nation of magi-tech people?
24-11-2017T16:51:08,Bgrmystr2,"Because I know how to differenciate fantasy from reality? Also, kinda seems weird when you suddenly see mecha and guns and stuff in games centered around swords and shields."
24-11-2017T16:51:48,Bgrmystr2,"That's just a disconnect, and I see a lot of people complain about it, so I mean.. I dunno? xD"
24-11-2017T16:52:00,Bgrmystr2,"also, I don't recall magi-tech reference?"
24-11-2017T16:52:10,sunblaze,you really should watch more anime
24-11-2017T16:52:16,Bgrmystr2,as if I don't already
24-11-2017T16:52:22,Bgrmystr2,and they make really bad disconnects xD
24-11-2017T16:52:23,SageSaga,Chapter 2 - they talk about airplanes
24-11-2017T16:52:26,sunblaze,lots of sword/shield countered by mechas and cannons
24-11-2017T16:52:49,Bgrmystr2,anime doesn't usually bother trying to stay in one genre
24-11-2017T16:52:54,Bgrmystr2,xD
24-11-2017T16:53:06,SageSaga,neither do games
24-11-2017T16:53:11,sunblaze,true and neither do comics in fact
24-11-2017T16:53:23,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno about that, honestly."
24-11-2017T16:53:31,SageSaga,Skyrim
24-11-2017T16:53:47,SageSaga,did you play on Steam?
24-11-2017T16:53:50,Bgrmystr2,Everything I've seen of skyrim is literally swords and shields and magic and dragons.
24-11-2017T16:53:58,Bgrmystr2,I never played it xD
24-11-2017T16:54:09,sunblaze,myriads of superheroes that get their power from the dark dormant power of the universe vs. batman and ironman techbased
24-11-2017T16:54:17,SageSaga,so you didnt see the Portal Space core fall from space
24-11-2017T16:54:27,Bgrmystr2,no?
24-11-2017T16:54:41,Bgrmystr2,obligatory spaaaaaaace though
24-11-2017T16:54:55,sunblaze,yes axactly that and es witht he voice as well
24-11-2017T16:54:59,SageSaga,did you play Divinity Originial Sin 2 yet?
24-11-2017T16:55:00,neropan,ayo~
24-11-2017T16:55:12,sunblaze,hi nero stremaing agin?
24-11-2017T16:55:13,SageSaga,how about the Ultima series?
24-11-2017T16:55:14,FoxxTrotter,"Heya, Nero."
24-11-2017T16:55:23,Bgrmystr2,Neither one I've played lol
24-11-2017T16:55:25,Bgrmystr2,or have
24-11-2017T16:55:51,sunblaze,then on what are you basing your fantasy asumptions? what games HAVE you played
24-11-2017T16:55:53,SageSaga,How about Dungeons and dragons- where they actually have stats for rare treasure including ANTIMATER RIFLES
24-11-2017T16:56:11,neropan,maybe later sun boi
24-11-2017T16:56:15,sunblaze,alright
24-11-2017T16:56:22,Bgrmystr2,"lolol, the Diablo series is a good start."
24-11-2017T16:56:53,SageSaga,Ultima was all swords and magic- TILL YOU BOUGHT A SPACE SHIP AND FOUGHT TIE FIGHTERS!
24-11-2017T16:57:14,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-confused:
24-11-2017T16:58:00,sunblaze,lands of lore is similar to that as well
24-11-2017T16:58:11,SageSaga,its almost like Fantasy is something you can do almost anything with! like some kinda fantastical thing!
24-11-2017T16:58:11,Bgrmystr2,I don't know.. why that would be a thing xD
24-11-2017T16:58:18,sunblaze,or might and magic. andboss of MM6 is a computercore......
24-11-2017T16:58:35,sunblaze,that shoots lighting at you
24-11-2017T16:58:42,SageSaga,they stole that from Ultima
24-11-2017T16:58:51,sunblaze,oh? good to know
24-11-2017T16:59:03,Bgrmystr2,A lot of that seems like too much disconnect to me
24-11-2017T16:59:06,SageSaga,Yeah Ultima 3 or something- theres so many
24-11-2017T16:59:32,SageSaga,final boss was a computer apocalypse device
24-11-2017T16:59:58,SageSaga,"you just dont know how to fantasy then Bgr, im sorry"
24-11-2017T17:00:18,sunblaze,yeah its kinda amargeddon dragonslave spells are not enough powergaming? switch to spaceships and destroy galaxies.
24-11-2017T17:00:22,sunblaze,part of the powergrind
24-11-2017T17:00:34,Bgrmystr2,"Well that's fine. If fantasy means you can allow the world to lose it's belivability simply because you can add anything to it, then I don't think I'll ever understand it."
24-11-2017T17:01:17,SageSaga,you missed the point of Fantasy then- almost anything should be believable in a fantasy
24-11-2017T17:01:40,SageSaga,even more so if you know it's a fantasy- like what takes place inside of a game where someone is aware it is a game
24-11-2017T17:01:47,Bgrmystr2,xD
24-11-2017T17:02:05,Bgrmystr2,I'm ok being /that one guy/
24-11-2017T17:02:39,SageSaga,"Some fantasy worlds have aliens regularly show up- everyone on the planet is like ""This is normal"" but you- you reject what is normal for them because ""IMPOSSIBULL!"""
24-11-2017T17:02:42,sunblaze,well you do have a point that hardcore fantasy is low tech thats true.
24-11-2017T17:03:00,sunblaze,problem is hardcore fatasy is extraordinary rare and almost never 100%
24-11-2017T17:03:29,Bgrmystr2,I don't know of anything fantasy that isn't lowtech.
24-11-2017T17:03:42,SageSaga,Final Fantasy
24-11-2017T17:03:43,eric190,waves hello
24-11-2017T17:03:57,SageSaga,yo Eric
24-11-2017T17:04:03,Bgrmystr2,I guess I just haven't delved into the fantasy genre as far as other people
24-11-2017T17:04:19,SageSaga,if you are only familiar with LotR...
24-11-2017T17:04:25,sunblaze,start by playing 15 years of games and you learn in no time!
24-11-2017T17:04:33,Bgrmystr2,xD I didn't watch that either. It never interested me at all
24-11-2017T17:04:41,Bgrmystr2,"I'm a lost cause, sage"
24-11-2017T17:04:49,sunblaze,really? strange that is one of the hardcore ones.
24-11-2017T17:05:24,Bgrmystr2,"it seems cool for the genre and such, and it's all sords and shields and monsters and BIGGLOWYEYETHING and etc"
24-11-2017T17:05:28,Bgrmystr2,but ehh
24-11-2017T17:05:47,SageSaga,what the heck do you base your fantasy around!? The Neverending Story!?
24-11-2017T17:05:59,SageSaga,actually that cant be- even that has tech
24-11-2017T17:06:02,Bgrmystr2,xDD I haven't seen that either.
24-11-2017T17:06:07,sunblaze,that is mixed as well sage
24-11-2017T17:06:07,Bgrmystr2,So that doesn't help me
24-11-2017T17:06:33,Bgrmystr2,"Or if I did see it, I don't really remember"
24-11-2017T17:06:39,SageSaga,o_o are you a 12 year old? am i yelling at a child?
24-11-2017T17:06:43,Bgrmystr2,LOL
24-11-2017T17:06:55,Bgrmystr2,"At this point, I don't know?"
24-11-2017T17:06:57,sunblaze,it has a flying dog-like dragon in it.
24-11-2017T17:07:00,sunblaze,you remember that
24-11-2017T17:07:06,ZRO4825,Damnit Bgr!
24-11-2017T17:07:10,Bgrmystr2,I don't remember anything from it
24-11-2017T17:07:15,Bgrmystr2,literally zero
24-11-2017T17:07:26,ZRO4825,XD
24-11-2017T17:07:28,Bgrmystr2,"so if I did see it, it was too long ago for me to even recall that I saw it"
24-11-2017T17:07:31,Bgrmystr2,Heya zro
24-11-2017T17:07:46,ZRO4825,"Just poppin in via the app for a moment, lol"
24-11-2017T17:07:47,w0lfmare,What HAVE you seen?
24-11-2017T17:08:00,Bgrmystr2,NOT FANTASY APPARENTLY XD
24-11-2017T17:08:20,w0lfmare,:cw0lfmare-EmberHide:
24-11-2017T17:08:52,Bgrmystr2,"Every time I see something labeled ""fantasy"", it's always the ye old sword and shield and olden times"
24-11-2017T17:09:00,Bgrmystr2,where technology isn't exactly a thing
24-11-2017T17:09:14,SageSaga,what have you ever seen that is labeled fantasy!? I must know!!!
24-11-2017T17:09:23,sunblaze,wait labeled? so you did not watch/play it?
24-11-2017T17:09:27,SageSaga,WHO HURT YOU?!
24-11-2017T17:09:30,Bgrmystr2,haha
24-11-2017T17:09:43,sunblaze,thats an advertisment thing them. fentasy sells better then sci-fi most of the time
24-11-2017T17:10:06,Bgrmystr2,"a lot of things over the years, lotta games, lotta movies, usually didn't have the money to buy movies or games to play/watch em"
24-11-2017T17:10:35,Bgrmystr2,but I don't know why the advertisement would be different from the final product. It's like.. false advertisement or something :thinking:
24-11-2017T17:10:49,sunblaze,it sells. thats all they care
24-11-2017T17:10:54,Bgrmystr2,yeh
24-11-2017T17:11:15,Bgrmystr2,I've seen a friend of mine play Oblivion from start to finish
24-11-2017T17:11:23,SageSaga,"so you just see the covers of these things and all you see is a guy holding a sword or a Shield and you say ""That's fantasy- people with swords and shields- that's make believe!"""
24-11-2017T17:11:46,sunblaze,you mean a game where you literally have sci-fi warp-gates drop on your head :D
24-11-2017T17:12:04,Bgrmystr2,I don't recall that sun XD
24-11-2017T17:12:10,SageSaga,so unrealistic!
24-11-2017T17:12:15,sunblaze,its like 60% of the gameeeee....
24-11-2017T17:12:38,Bgrmystr2,Most of the game I saw was just him running around the map stabbing things
24-11-2017T17:12:42,Bgrmystr2,or talking to people to make things
24-11-2017T17:13:07,sunblaze,after kvatch those thing appear EVERYWHERE and are all blood&gore inside
24-11-2017T17:13:47,sunblaze,not to mention all those steampunk dweemer ruins
24-11-2017T17:14:05,Bgrmystr2,"Honestly, I've seen lots of clips of Final Fantasy, but it's always like.. magicstuffs. I don't recall seeing anything technology. Buildings, sure, but not technology."
24-11-2017T17:14:07,sunblaze,but granted there are very few in oblivion most are in morrowind and skyrim
24-11-2017T17:14:28,Bgrmystr2,"I don't think I saw much of the latter two, Sun"
24-11-2017T17:14:32,sunblaze,Bgrmystr2 like the motorbikes?
24-11-2017T17:14:38,sunblaze,or thousands of guns?
24-11-2017T17:14:47,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: I don't know?
24-11-2017T17:15:02,Bgrmystr2,I was thinking like spells and stuff
24-11-2017T17:15:06,Bgrmystr2,and elementals
24-11-2017T17:15:13,Bgrmystr2,and stuff you put on your items
24-11-2017T17:15:29,Bgrmystr2,things like that. magicstuffs
24-11-2017T17:15:31,sunblaze,watch advent children just for fun
24-11-2017T17:15:40,sunblaze,and then tell me again tehre is only magic inside :D
24-11-2017T17:15:48,SageSaga,http://thenerdstash.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Ragnarok-3.jpg
24-11-2017T17:16:04,sunblaze,^so low-tech
24-11-2017T17:16:07,Bgrmystr2,that's a mech of some type.
24-11-2017T17:16:14,SageSaga,that is a spaceship from FF
24-11-2017T17:16:29,SageSaga,A SPACE SHIP
24-11-2017T17:16:47,sunblaze,you are raging sage. and so am I in fact... :(
24-11-2017T17:17:05,Bgrmystr2,"I get the feeling that not all FF games are based around sword/shield, but aren't there like 14+ games now? maybe 15?"
24-11-2017T17:17:47,Bgrmystr2,unless we're on like FF 40 or someshit now :v
24-11-2017T17:18:04,Bgrmystr2,I don't think either of you are raging XD
24-11-2017T17:18:12,Bgrmystr2,doesn't look like it
24-11-2017T17:18:24,SageSaga,nah im just flabbergasted
24-11-2017T17:19:14,w0lfmare,"""How do you live a life without fantasy?!"""
24-11-2017T17:19:23,Bgrmystr2,Uh.. pretty easily I guess?
24-11-2017T17:19:26,sunblaze,and I admit I do not know FF1-6 but since 7 tech has a good part in it
24-11-2017T17:19:35,sunblaze,sometimes more sometimes less depends on the setting
24-11-2017T17:20:31,SageSaga,6 was heavy Magi-Tech
24-11-2017T17:20:51,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, I want fantasy, I jump into something like Diablo and shoot fireballs and stab things.. I mean, I sat there and played Maple Story, a fantasy-based MMORPG, originally.."
24-11-2017T17:20:56,SageSaga,but even earlier ones had tech in them
24-11-2017T17:21:10,Bgrmystr2,then they added mechs and lasers and it just kinda created a bigass disconnect
24-11-2017T17:21:24,SageSaga,why cant they both exist?
24-11-2017T17:21:38,SageSaga,heck wouldnt magic make it more possible for things like that to be made?
24-11-2017T17:21:59,Bgrmystr2,"because if the technology for mechanical stuff exists, then why hasn't it been widely adopted to make life better? Industrial revolution etc"
24-11-2017T17:22:43,sunblaze,easy to answer
24-11-2017T17:22:44,SageSaga,can you not reason that out at all?
24-11-2017T17:23:00,SageSaga,let him come up with a reason- that's how you create stories
24-11-2017T17:23:13,sunblaze,why reserach medics and health when you have clerics that can res people.
24-11-2017T17:23:23,Bgrmystr2,"That's not the same question, Sun"
24-11-2017T17:23:43,sunblaze,so you focus on the destructive part of tech or reason that either magic or tech is to expensive to the common man to use
24-11-2017T17:24:30,SageSaga,"Ok Bgr, let's just google what Fantasy means and end this"
24-11-2017T17:24:37,SageSaga,"Fantasy - the faculty or activity of imagining things, especially things that are impossible or improbable."
24-11-2017T17:24:39,SageSaga,OMG
24-11-2017T17:25:34,Rosscoe,Good eveing all!
24-11-2017T17:25:40,FoxxTrotter,"Hey, Rosscoe."
24-11-2017T17:25:40,SageSaga,yo Rosscoe
24-11-2017T17:25:45,Rosscoe,:ptv-confused: uuuuuh is this a bad time?
24-11-2017T17:26:28,Bgrmystr2,":thinking: I dunno, just seems like normal conversation to me"
24-11-2017T17:26:30,Rosscoe,"Seems like a heated debate has started, or ended?"
24-11-2017T17:26:51,SageSaga,Bgr is just blowing our minds with how his fantasy is all based in reality and how anything not based in reality cant be fantasy
24-11-2017T17:27:03,Rosscoe,Ooooooh
24-11-2017T17:27:26,Bgrmystr2,I think.. you may have that backwards?
24-11-2017T17:27:43,Bgrmystr2,xD
24-11-2017T17:28:34,SageSaga,Bgr cant accept fantastical elements in a fantasy story.
24-11-2017T17:29:06,SageSaga,they are just too much- hes ok with magic to a point- but throw some tech in there and IMMERSION BROKEN! you cant have TECH AND MAGIC!
24-11-2017T17:29:43,Rosscoe,So hes a scientology minded person.
24-11-2017T17:30:00,w0lfmare,"I'm not so sure a bright flash of light has to be tech though, if it's in a world of magic"
24-11-2017T17:30:21,Bgrmystr2,xD I like how this has escalated from my not seeing anything with science and magic together somehow magically means that I believe they are unconnectable
24-11-2017T17:31:08,SageSaga,you insisted that you cannot see it existing because you dont see those things co-existing in fantasy
24-11-2017T17:31:20,Rosscoe,Just means you have no imagination Bgrmystr2 XD
24-11-2017T17:31:42,Bgrmystr2,XD and then the escalation goes further.
24-11-2017T17:31:47,Bgrmystr2,"That's just untrue, Ross"
24-11-2017T17:33:01,Bgrmystr2,"Breaking immersion is a dealbreaker to me though, you've got that one right Sage"
24-11-2017T17:33:22,Bgrmystr2,but it's not exactly black and white
24-11-2017T17:33:33,SageSaga,yeah but you are saying fantasy elements can break your immersion XD
24-11-2017T17:33:55,Rosscoe,DEAD POOL BREAKS EVERYTHING! There fights over now lets enjoy the show!
24-11-2017T17:34:09,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, Torchlight 2 is fantasy yeah? Has sword&shield magic, but it also has guns and mechs and such"
24-11-2017T17:34:13,Bgrmystr2,in a steampunk style
24-11-2017T17:34:21,Bgrmystr2,and doesn't really break the immersion of the world at all
24-11-2017T17:34:43,w0lfmare,Small vial of magic that makes a bright flash when broken
24-11-2017T17:34:54,w0lfmare,"Done, immersion fixed :cw0lfmare-KiaHalo:"
24-11-2017T17:35:01,Bgrmystr2,"it's a great example, albeit recent"
24-11-2017T17:35:12,Bgrmystr2,lol w0lf
24-11-2017T17:36:27,Rosscoe,@Sagesaga I been see nthis REM gif surface alot on other streams on teh front Picarto page recently. its becoming a trend
24-11-2017T17:36:46,Bgrmystr2,dancing rem is always acceptable
24-11-2017T17:37:12,SageSaga,I was the first- they are all just copying me
24-11-2017T17:38:04,Bgrmystr2,Hmm.. was it Re:zero or Smartphone that the guy made himself a gun in the world he went to?
24-11-2017T17:38:23,SageSaga,Smartphone brat
24-11-2017T17:38:31,Bgrmystr2,okay
24-11-2017T17:39:03,Bgrmystr2,"It makes sense in the story, but it was strange to everyone else in the world"
24-11-2017T17:39:19,Bgrmystr2,though the smartphone was too
24-11-2017T17:39:40,SageSaga,he just told everyone the smartphone was a magical artifact- everyone just accepted that
24-11-2017T17:39:49,Bgrmystr2,yeah xD
24-11-2017T17:40:08,SageSaga,even people who were very familiar with magical artifacts
24-11-2017T17:41:40,SageSaga,god that show was so bad... i kinda hope it gets a second season but i also hope it doesnt
24-11-2017T17:41:45,Bgrmystr2,XD
24-11-2017T17:42:02,Rosscoe,Is that Sonico in the other gif?
24-11-2017T17:42:07,Bgrmystr2,no
24-11-2017T17:42:12,w0lfmare,"Re:zero, or that other one?"
24-11-2017T17:42:16,Bgrmystr2,It's Ero-manga sensei
24-11-2017T17:42:30,SageSaga,Smartphone anime
24-11-2017T17:42:38,SageSaga,I would love another Re:Zero anime
24-11-2017T17:42:51,SageSaga,but i know what happens next so maybe not
24-11-2017T17:43:43,Bgrmystr2,"I love that the smartphone anime took that disconnect, completely downplayed it, and acted like it was completely normal xD"
24-11-2017T17:43:59,SageSaga,god that anime was so dumb
24-11-2017T17:44:46,Rosscoe,"Well I got a email here from the one Asain only hobby store I get emails from, theres pre-orders up for some new stuff and one of it is Sonico in a bikini weilding a big chain saw, must be zombie season again"
24-11-2017T17:44:48,SageSaga,i really hope it just turns out hes in a hospital bed dreaming this new perfect life- wakes up and cant take the stress of the real world where not everything goes his way and offs himself
24-11-2017T17:45:49,Bgrmystr2,that anime literally puts front-and-center the disconnect I tend to see from technology added to fantasy
24-11-2017T17:47:13,SageSaga,the only reason i like it is to see how he can use knowledge of tech to do cool things in a world without tech- BUT he just abuses it to absurd levels because hes the most over powered magic user in the world because LITERALLY GOD MADE IT SO
24-11-2017T17:47:27,Bgrmystr2,XD yeah
24-11-2017T17:47:49,Rosscoe,that anime sounds messed up +20
24-11-2017T17:48:05,Bgrmystr2,"you should give it a watch Ross, and see for yourself"
24-11-2017T17:48:16,SageSaga,ive read stories about how a guy used his knowledge of biology and tech in a fantasy world that he wasnt from to basically cause a retrovirus to infuse him with the mana of a god
24-11-2017T17:48:21,SageSaga,that was awesome!
24-11-2017T17:48:44,SageSaga,it also had serious drawbacks- but it worked
24-11-2017T17:48:46,Bgrmystr2,"I'd give it a 'So bad it's good' rating, myself."
24-11-2017T17:49:43,Rosscoe,So its so bad its funny?
24-11-2017T17:49:48,Rosscoe,Whats the name of it?
24-11-2017T17:50:03,SageSaga,"=_= ""In another world with my smartphone"""
24-11-2017T17:50:13,SageSaga,even the name pisses me off
24-11-2017T17:50:15,Rosscoe,Ok I'll google that
24-11-2017T17:50:31,Rosscoe,"Sounds like ""I have ALL THIS POWER! But I wont go after the booty"""
24-11-2017T17:50:45,Bgrmystr2,Don't worry about that
24-11-2017T17:50:48,Bgrmystr2,the booty went to him
24-11-2017T17:50:53,Bgrmystr2,:V
24-11-2017T17:51:57,Rosscoe,Hmmm
24-11-2017T17:52:02,Rosscoe,Yea
24-11-2017T17:52:02,SageSaga,"yeah- even God is like ""It's ok- in this world you can take multiple lives and being a Pedo is ok too!"" ""God- you scare me"""
24-11-2017T17:52:18,SageSaga,multiple wives*
24-11-2017T17:52:22,Rosscoe,"Yea seems like a comdey that is SO BAD, its good."
24-11-2017T17:52:30,Bgrmystr2,right? xD
24-11-2017T17:52:49,SageSaga,"""God- this girl is 14"" ""So?"" ""WHAT ARE YOU THE GOD OF?!"""
24-11-2017T17:53:32,w0lfmare,So many disappointing anime
24-11-2017T17:53:35,Bgrmystr2,I love the absurdity of it. The fact that it takes it's obsurdity and owns it. Then rolls with it
24-11-2017T17:53:42,Bgrmystr2,that's just icing on the cake
24-11-2017T17:53:58,SageSaga,at least they didnt send his sister there and make her part of the harem
24-11-2017T17:54:00,w0lfmare,"I like plenty of anime, but I tend to be pretty picky"
24-11-2017T17:54:13,SageSaga,. . . omg someone check to make sure that didnt happen- that feels like something that would happen
24-11-2017T17:54:49,Rosscoe,"I like Anime wit ha good story, dont care if its a slow story, long as its goooood. Also something that mix's sillyness is also welcomed"
24-11-2017T17:55:45,SageSaga,watch Recovery of an MMO Junkie
24-11-2017T17:57:01,Rosscoe,"Ok I'll add those two to my list, right now I gota finish binge watching the new season of American Dad, finished Family guy the other night."
24-11-2017T17:57:26,Rosscoe,"Also, Nyan, being so mean"
24-11-2017T17:57:53,Crimellgrim,sage ya wanna join a lewd furry multystream?
24-11-2017T17:58:14,SageSaga,... why would i do that?
24-11-2017T17:58:28,Crimellgrim,idk
24-11-2017T17:58:31,Crimellgrim,jsut asking
24-11-2017T17:58:37,Crimellgrim,we got a spot
24-11-2017T17:58:42,SageSaga,besides- im almost done
24-11-2017T17:58:45,Crimellgrim,ah
24-11-2017T18:00:17,SageSaga,"im also always worried that if someone sees im streaming- they click and suddenly - theres streams of dicks and tits around people will be like ""OMG! UN FOLLOW!"""
24-11-2017T18:00:32,Bgrmystr2,xD
24-11-2017T18:00:51,Rosscoe,Is that why you go by Crime-llgrim? XD
24-11-2017T18:01:20,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, it's possible sage.. but it would also increase your fanbase by introducing more people to your art"
24-11-2017T18:01:57,SageSaga,maybe but then those people might be asking me to draw dicks and tits too
24-11-2017T18:02:54,Crimellgrim,peopel do that anway
24-11-2017T18:03:02,SageSaga,not really
24-11-2017T18:03:13,SageSaga,very rarely
24-11-2017T18:03:18,Rosscoe,"Sage, you can charge them for Censored Dicks and tits via undies!"
24-11-2017T18:04:05,Rosscoe,And then they will weep salty tears cause their all wearing their underware
24-11-2017T18:04:46,SageSaga,"i guess some people could translate ""Draw Toyoko"" to mean ""Draw big tits"""
24-11-2017T18:05:08,Rosscoe,The system works :thumbsup:
24-11-2017T18:05:17,Bgrmystr2,you say that as if people probably don't already do that? :thinking:
24-11-2017T18:06:45,SageSaga,i dont think they do
24-11-2017T18:09:22,w0lfmare,Yeah I don't like the idea of streaming with NSFW streamers
24-11-2017T18:09:42,Nekonny,o/
24-11-2017T18:09:47,FoxxTrotter,"Heya, Neko."
24-11-2017T18:09:58,Rosscoe,Evening Nekonny!
24-11-2017T18:10:01,SageSaga,yeah- like Nekonny
24-11-2017T18:10:06,w0lfmare,"If you're a SFW artist with a following interested in your SFW stuff, it's feels like alienating your own audience"
24-11-2017T18:10:38,Nekonny,like me?
24-11-2017T18:10:48,Nekonny,LIke me what?
24-11-2017T18:11:08,SageSaga,you stream with NSFWers all the time - and even do some such art!
24-11-2017T18:11:23,Bgrmystr2,I don't think it would alienate your audience just because you're streaming with somone who's NSFW. You're still making the SFW stuff they're there for.
24-11-2017T18:11:25,Nekonny,You have more experience in that than me
24-11-2017T18:11:28,Nekonny,I'm sure
24-11-2017T18:11:50,SageSaga,ive never had to change my SFW settings
24-11-2017T18:12:12,SageSaga,"you stream with Godai, Chalo, and Aven all the time"
24-11-2017T18:12:15,w0lfmare,"But your chats merge. so suddenly, the chat gets flooded with vulgar jokes and comments"
24-11-2017T18:12:18,Nekonny,so....
24-11-2017T18:12:40,Nekonny,"Actually, that seems to happen less often than you would think"
24-11-2017T18:12:44,Nekonny,art is art
24-11-2017T18:13:03,Mihari,Excuse senses tingling...
24-11-2017T18:13:04,SageSaga,i see it happen all the time
24-11-2017T18:13:20,Nekonny,"I've been called the most prude person on the KB, and even I think thats"
24-11-2017T18:13:31,Rosscoe,Fabulas?
24-11-2017T18:13:34,Nekonny,an exaggeration
24-11-2017T18:13:34,Mihari,I used to call you that.
24-11-2017T18:13:45,Mihari,Key word... used to.
24-11-2017T18:13:54,Nekonny,you werent the only one
24-11-2017T18:14:05,Nekonny,and it's not like Ive fallen off a deep end
24-11-2017T18:14:10,Mihari,Yet ;P
24-11-2017T18:14:23,Nekonny,I don't see it ever happeneing
24-11-2017T18:15:22,Nekonny,YOu said it as a defect
24-11-2017T18:15:24,Mihari,"Time will tell, cause lets face it, if you asked me years ago if you'd be drawing what you are these days... I would have laughed :P"
24-11-2017T18:15:29,SageSaga,we werent talking as much about you doing NSFW stuff as streaming with a lot of people who do and how we feel it alienates part of your audience if ya do that
24-11-2017T18:15:37,Nekonny,"and now that it's not, its just another kind of defect? ^_^ """
24-11-2017T18:15:44,Nekonny,"Oh, I see"
24-11-2017T18:15:53,Nekonny,"yeah, some stuff may be way tooo out there"
24-11-2017T18:15:55,Mihari,"I never said it was a defect, I often praised for it too."
24-11-2017T18:16:02,Nekonny,but art is art I suppose
24-11-2017T18:16:08,Rosscoe,Art is Art
24-11-2017T18:16:19,Bgrmystr2,"Tis the way I see it, Ross"
24-11-2017T18:17:04,Nekonny,"A lot of people could see Toms stuff as technically nsfw, for example"
24-11-2017T18:17:07,Rosscoe,"See Avencri does wonderful nude art , Chalo & Godai feed what the super pervs want :neutral_face:"
24-11-2017T18:17:31,Nekonny,Bu tthers nothing wrong with it from the cultural perspective of the comic
24-11-2017T18:17:34,w0lfmare,"If you do truly see them as equivalent, why do you stay on the SFW side Ron?"
24-11-2017T18:17:44,SageSaga,he doesnt
24-11-2017T18:17:58,Nekonny,naked is naked
24-11-2017T18:18:09,Mihari,Now you're just glazing over things.
24-11-2017T18:18:16,Mihari,But have it your way.
24-11-2017T18:18:22,w0lfmare,"Ah, I must have missed something XD"
24-11-2017T18:18:37,Nekonny,I'm not judging. I'm just pointing out what it could look as from an outsiders perspective
24-11-2017T18:18:57,Mihari,"You're not judging, you're excusing, and justifying."
24-11-2017T18:19:10,Mihari,Waving it off like it's absolutely nothing.
24-11-2017T18:19:24,Nekonny,What do you mean?
24-11-2017T18:20:35,Nekonny,I don't think that there is anything wrong with it
24-11-2017T18:21:01,Rosscoe,Ok im craving tater chips REALLY badly.
24-11-2017T18:21:04,Mihari,No one said there was anything wrong with it.
24-11-2017T18:21:14,Nekonny,and I thought I was doing the opposite of glazing it over
24-11-2017T18:21:32,Mihari,"""art is art"" ""naked is naked"" Yep, totally not. :P"
24-11-2017T18:21:59,Rosscoe,The phrasing I could do right now would get me banned for a day :joy:
24-11-2017T18:22:13,Nekonny,"the expression or application of human creative skill and imagination,"
24-11-2017T18:22:15,Nekonny,art
24-11-2017T18:22:22,Nekonny,so it's all art
24-11-2017T18:22:46,Nekonny,"I can appreciate well done art, regardless of the content"
24-11-2017T18:23:13,Nekonny,but not all content is my cup of tea. I respect what everyone does and I hope nobody takes offence if I don't like this or that
24-11-2017T18:23:19,Mihari,"And that so wasn't the point of all of this either... ya know what, nevermind."
24-11-2017T18:23:25,Nekonny,I don't press my opinion on other people
24-11-2017T18:24:10,Nekonny,"Well, we were talking about the hole idea of it being tabloo to stream with NSFW artists"
24-11-2017T18:24:16,Nekonny,*taboo
24-11-2017T18:24:22,Nekonny,*whole
24-11-2017T18:24:46,SageSaga,not Taboo
24-11-2017T18:25:11,SageSaga,we were talking about alienating your SFW fans by streaming with NSFW artists
24-11-2017T18:25:15,Mihari,"Ummm no, the it was stated that Sage didn't want to stream with NSFW artists because it COULD aliennate the people who are there and only want to see SFW content."
24-11-2017T18:25:35,Mihari,"Which means art is NOT just art, there are subsets, categories, content, etc."
24-11-2017T18:25:39,Nekonny,I agree that is a possibility
24-11-2017T18:25:53,Mihari,"And naked while is just naked, some people aren't comfortable with it."
24-11-2017T18:26:12,Mihari,You of all people should know that.
24-11-2017T18:26:16,Nekonny,But people have criteria of what constitutes NSFW
24-11-2017T18:26:34,Nekonny,an it changes somewhat from person to person. there is a greay area
24-11-2017T18:26:42,Nekonny,But I do get what you mean
24-11-2017T18:26:48,Mihari,I think we all know here what is NSFW by the definitions of art...
24-11-2017T18:26:52,Mihari,No need to get techincal.
24-11-2017T18:26:52,Nekonny,"And yeah, you guys make good points"
24-11-2017T18:27:31,Nekonny,I think there are a lot of extremes out there
24-11-2017T18:27:40,Mihari,"Again, not really the point."
24-11-2017T18:28:06,Nekonny,"if all we are doing is streaming for the readers/viewers, then sure"
24-11-2017T18:28:28,Nekonny,"there are good people out there that happen to do NSFW art,"
24-11-2017T18:28:56,Nekonny,And I do enjoy their company from time to time
24-11-2017T18:29:03,Mihari,"... again, not the point."
24-11-2017T18:29:16,Nekonny,But I'm obviously looking at it from a different perspective.
24-11-2017T18:29:29,SageSaga,i never said NSFW artists are bad people Ron
24-11-2017T18:29:33,Nekonny,I know
24-11-2017T18:29:37,w0lfmare,"True, there are plenty of wonderful people who happen to draw NSFW"
24-11-2017T18:30:08,Rosscoe,"Guys I'll be back in a few minutes, just going down a house over to teh gas station to grab some chips sooo brb XD"
24-11-2017T18:30:15,w0lfmare,Later Ross
24-11-2017T18:30:18,SageSaga,by bringing it up you are using it as a defense- which means you are saying we dont feel that way
24-11-2017T18:30:35,Nekonny,not at all
24-11-2017T18:30:43,Nekonny,and I'm sorry it came across as that
24-11-2017T18:32:58,SageSaga,Allow me to explain what you missed then- The issue was someone asked if i wanted to join a Lewd Furry multi-stream
24-11-2017T18:33:18,SageSaga,I declined because i didnt want to alienate my SFW only audience
24-11-2017T18:33:31,Nekonny,Completely understandable
24-11-2017T18:33:32,SageSaga,and i had no idea who they were so that too
24-11-2017T18:34:44,Nekonny,"I guess I ended up speaking up because of what came after; Ive been criticized for streaming with NSFW artists, and it comes off in a bad way"
24-11-2017T18:35:37,Nekonny,It's perfectly fine to only want to do SFW stuff and stream with like minded content creators
24-11-2017T18:37:14,SageSaga,we were talking about streaming with NSFW streamers and then you for some reason said i had more experience with that when almost half the time i see you streaming it says NSFW
24-11-2017T18:37:36,Crimellgrim,man
24-11-2017T18:37:42,Crimellgrim,this derailed really badly
24-11-2017T18:37:46,SageSaga,so i stream twice a week every week for the past year- how does that compare?
24-11-2017T18:37:50,Rosscoe,Annnd back
24-11-2017T18:38:13,Bgrmystr2,"To be fair, it was probably just an eventuality, Crimell"
24-11-2017T18:38:17,Bgrmystr2,:c
24-11-2017T18:38:19,Nekonny,Not what I mean't
24-11-2017T18:39:22,Nekonny,"Obviously, since you don't stream with nsfw"
24-11-2017T18:39:53,SageSaga,then what the heck did you mean?
24-11-2017T18:41:16,Nekonny,"The point got lost in the discussion,"
24-11-2017T18:41:47,Nekonny,So I take it back and apologize
24-11-2017T18:42:47,Rosscoe,This calls for a multistream!
24-11-2017T18:44:24,Nekonny,more like it calls for me to be quiet and stop being a doofus.
24-11-2017T18:44:28,SageSaga,why would we have a multistream?
24-11-2017T18:44:30,Nekonny,Sorry everyone
24-11-2017T18:44:41,Nekonny,Sage is ending soon it look slike
24-11-2017T18:44:47,Nekonny,page is pretty far ahead
24-11-2017T18:44:51,Rosscoe,Oh right
24-11-2017T18:45:02,Bgrmystr2,soon.. her eys will have color lol
24-11-2017T18:45:53,Rosscoe,Dont feel bad Nekonny! We all have our days where the point flew over our heads.
24-11-2017T18:46:25,Bgrmystr2,"It's ok, Ron's not alone in that"
24-11-2017T18:46:31,Bgrmystr2,I'm sure it could be said of many.
24-11-2017T18:46:37,Nekonny,"Yeah, but I should know better, I don't want to alienate friends"
24-11-2017T18:47:09,Bgrmystr2,I would presume friends should be accepting of someone's changes. :thinking:

24-11-2017T18:55:19,Bgrmystr2,it didn't have a dub when I watched it
24-11-2017T18:55:43,RedDragonSyndicate,"Oh hey, it's that character I've been waiting six decades to arrive in AI :D"
24-11-2017T18:55:50,RedDragonSyndicate,yaaaaaaaaaaay

24-11-2017T18:56:41,SageSaga,also thats 60 years...
24-11-2017T18:56:41,RedDragonSyndicate,I've been enjoying it :)
24-11-2017T18:56:57,RedDragonSyndicate,"We all know you're immortal, Sage"
24-11-2017T18:57:09,SageSaga,yeah but that means so are you

24-11-2017T18:57:49,Rosscoe,"annnnnd yea, this is a trash anime"
24-11-2017T18:58:08,SageSaga,doesnt take long does it Rosscoe?
24-11-2017T18:58:12,Bgrmystr2,you got that out of how long watching it?
24-11-2017T18:58:51,SageSaga,you can figure it out easily by the time before he reaches the 2 helpless girls THAT ARENT HELPLESS AT ALL LATER!
24-11-2017T18:59:13,SageSaga,She freakn punches through bricks! and she was all helpless when 2 thugs showed up
24-11-2017T18:59:31,RedDragonSyndicate,#tropes
24-11-2017T19:00:11,w0lfmare,Hate it when stories aren't consistent
24-11-2017T19:00:13,Bgrmystr2,"""Saved"" them. If they're capable of magic, I don't see why the thungs are not"
24-11-2017T19:00:21,Bgrmystr2,..thugs* even
24-11-2017T19:00:37,SageSaga,you didnt hear her explain magic then
24-11-2017T19:01:07,Bgrmystr2,Yeah I don't actually recall that part too well :thinking:
24-11-2017T19:01:54,SageSaga,the magic user sister was gifted with magic - being able to use multiple types- and her sister was extremely gifted with one type - so they were both above average and armed- the Thug were not and easily taken down by a guy with the same power as her
24-11-2017T19:02:35,Bgrmystr2,maybe he just thinks they were in trouble when they weren't and he's too stupid to realize he was dumb.
24-11-2017T19:02:54,Bgrmystr2,stereotypical dumb protag
24-11-2017T19:03:00,Rosscoe,Saaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaage. What trashy corny nime did you send me binge wtching on?!
24-11-2017T19:03:00,SageSaga,then why did they take him back to their hotel to thank him for his UNEEDED HELP
24-11-2017T19:03:20,SageSaga,I WARNED YOU IT WAS TRASH!
24-11-2017T19:04:37,Bgrmystr2,"Hey, I would have still thanked him. It'd be two less people I needed to deal with."
24-11-2017T19:04:55,Bgrmystr2,even if it wasn't that big a deal
24-11-2017T19:05:12,SageSaga,the younger sister may have but the older one wouldnt
24-11-2017T19:05:16,SageSaga,it was out of character
24-11-2017T19:05:38,Rosscoe,Nekonny! your watching this on youtube with meeeh! I will not sink to this alone! Or wil lI? XD
24-11-2017T19:05:38,SageSaga,"unless she was actually ""OMG hes soooo Protag Hot- i gotta get that boy to myself!"""
24-11-2017T19:06:35,SageSaga,Protag Hot is a Trope right?
24-11-2017T19:07:06,Bgrmystr2,uh..
24-11-2017T19:07:08,Bgrmystr2,I don't know
24-11-2017T19:07:30,SageSaga,it might have a different name but -
24-11-2017T19:07:38,Bgrmystr2,I would expect it to just be simply BECAUSE protag.
24-11-2017T19:07:47,Bgrmystr2,doesn't need to be hot or useful or smart
24-11-2017T19:07:51,Bgrmystr2,just.. because protag.
24-11-2017T19:07:59,SageSaga,a character who everyone is attracted to for no apparent reason other than because they are the main character
24-11-2017T19:08:13,Bgrmystr2,yeah that
24-11-2017T19:08:15,Bgrmystr2,that's a trope
24-11-2017T19:08:18,SageSaga,Protag Hot
24-11-2017T19:08:18,Bgrmystr2,of some type
24-11-2017T19:08:28,SageSaga,should be the name for it now
24-11-2017T19:08:31,SageSaga,someone find it
24-11-2017T19:08:31,Bgrmystr2,xDD

24-11-2017T19:10:45,Rosscoe,God gave this boy too much power &gt;.&gt;
24-11-2017T19:11:00,SageSaga,God made him a boring Gary Sue
24-11-2017T19:11:31,SageSaga,"there are interesting version of the ""Gary/Mary Sue"" but this is not one of them"

24-11-2017T19:13:48,Bgrmystr2,"I know it's out there, but dunno what it's called"
24-11-2017T19:14:09,SageSaga,gotta let the song play out
24-11-2017T19:15:18,Bgrmystr2,loser protagonist may be a good place to start on tv tropes
24-11-2017T19:15:23,Bgrmystr2,but that's as far as I've gotten
24-11-2017T19:15:26,Bgrmystr2,:c
24-11-2017T19:15:37,Bgrmystr2,hard to find things on there sometimes
