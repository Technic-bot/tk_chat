06-11-2017T21:44:25,BluePhantom90,hmm Netflix came out with a new Fate anime. Its really good
06-11-2017T22:03:55,Dadrobit,D: I have delicious pierogies.... But cooking them requires effort... And I don't feel like doing effort right now...
06-11-2017T22:12:55,unsteddyphoenix,Are those those things you cook with vodka?
06-11-2017T22:13:52,BluePhantom90,thought we call them vodka gummy bears
06-11-2017T22:16:19,unsteddyphoenix,Damn the masks are so cool~
06-11-2017T22:16:28,Dadrobit,N... No?
06-11-2017T22:16:34,Dadrobit,Maybe?
06-11-2017T22:16:52,Dadrobit,Am I missing out on a new and amazing method of cooking?
06-11-2017T22:17:40,Dadrobit,"Or, like, do you mean that you're usually smashed on vodka when you cook them?"
06-11-2017T22:18:00,BluePhantom90,its not really cooking. you get a big bowl of gummy bears and pour in vodka. they absorb it and get swollen up. Its a treat to get drunk without drinking
06-11-2017T22:18:37,unsteddyphoenix,Uh...
06-11-2017T22:18:45,unsteddyphoenix,Putting that aside
06-11-2017T22:19:17,unsteddyphoenix,Cooking with vodka as in putting it in and reducing the alcohol out
06-11-2017T22:19:23,unsteddyphoenix,Never cooked with wine before?
06-11-2017T22:20:41,Dadrobit,"Oh, no wasn't talking about the gummy bears. I went through college, I'm very aware of spike gummy bears. Was just unaware someone would cook pierogies with vodka."
06-11-2017T22:20:48,Dadrobit,spiked*
06-11-2017T22:21:54,Dadrobit,"For sure I've cooked with wine, bourbon too, but vodka's not my deal usually. That being said, I was curious if I was missing out on a crucial methodology."
06-11-2017T22:27:44,Dadrobit,"Hmmm, I have some Malibu coconut rum, vanilla Smirnoff, Makers Mark, and some Makers 46. Might use some later tonight when I feel better on my feet."
06-11-2017T22:32:58,unsteddyphoenix,Niiice~
