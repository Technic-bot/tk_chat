07-11-2017T00:12:56,BluePhantom90,"this New anime from Netflix is vary cool. just weird a women keeps calling herself a man, and her... Father is a Women"
07-11-2017T00:13:45,BluePhantom90,Which her mother was a witch. Sooooo yeah weird
07-11-2017T00:16:48,Bgrmystr2,ahhhhhhhhh this page is HYPE :ptv-excited:
07-11-2017T00:17:08,Bgrmystr2,I am so ready to see the pages you drew earlier before the anniversary
07-11-2017T00:17:20,Bgrmystr2,"or.. what's left of them, I guess."
07-11-2017T00:18:48,BadFoMo,Pages? All I remember is the one where Reni was flying to the place.
07-11-2017T00:19:16,Dadrobit,Was that the same one where she landed and killed everyone except Red?
07-11-2017T00:20:09,BluePhantom90,"there was one when Reni lands in front of Team B, then I Think Tom drew the other page with Zen taken to the Estate. but I am not too sure"
07-11-2017T00:20:41,Bgrmystr2,That's two separate page
07-11-2017T00:20:43,Bgrmystr2,s
07-11-2017T00:20:55,Bgrmystr2,One page was almost fully drawn
07-11-2017T00:20:58,Bgrmystr2,and the other one was not
07-11-2017T00:21:35,Bgrmystr2,"One was flying to the place, the other one was landing there."
07-11-2017T00:21:39,Bgrmystr2,far as I remember
07-11-2017T00:21:49,Bgrmystr2,it should still be in the recordings.
07-11-2017T00:21:58,BluePhantom90,oh yeah that one
07-11-2017T00:22:03,Bgrmystr2,"though, maybe not.."
07-11-2017T00:22:07,Bgrmystr2,cuz all the sunday streams
07-11-2017T00:22:11,Bgrmystr2,and friday streams
07-11-2017T00:26:03,Bgrmystr2,"Actually, I don't think it's there"
07-11-2017T00:26:18,Bgrmystr2,cuz the earliest stream saved here on picarto is the 21st of Oct
07-11-2017T00:26:27,Bgrmystr2,and it was the day before that he did the other pages
07-11-2017T00:26:32,Bgrmystr2,and that's not here.
07-11-2017T00:29:21,BluePhantom90,Even Vlad the 3rd is in this anime. or Vlad the impaler is in the anime
07-11-2017T00:32:24,unsteddyphoenix,Congrats on your 1000th page Tom! :D

07-11-2017T00:54:08,BluePhantom90,or well later today since it is tomorrow for me
07-11-2017T00:54:46,Dadrobit,"11pm, you?"
07-11-2017T00:55:00,BluePhantom90,12:54
07-11-2017T00:56:40,Dadrobit,"Also, my house smells like an Italian eatery inside of a brewery."
07-11-2017T00:56:46,Dadrobit,This is not a bad thing
07-11-2017T01:00:51,Dadrobit,"Hmmm, it does give it kind of a faint caramel taste to the breading of the periogi, but it's pretty easily overpowered by the spices and herbs inside once you really start chewing. Not bad at all though."
07-11-2017T01:44:43,unsteddyphoenix,outta 10?
07-11-2017T01:46:56,Dadrobit,7.5
07-11-2017T01:47:46,unsteddyphoenix,sounds positively edible :ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
07-11-2017T01:48:13,Dadrobit,Absolutely
07-11-2017T01:49:07,Dadrobit,"I think if I do it again next time, I'll probably brush on a a tiny bit of fresh bourbon after they cooked to give it a more distinct kick."
07-11-2017T01:49:27,Dadrobit,Without drowning it of course
07-11-2017T01:49:51,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
07-11-2017T01:50:11,unsteddyphoenix,I hear you can make some sort of alcohol cream sauce that goes with it. :thinking:
07-11-2017T01:50:35,Dadrobit,a dipping sauce?
07-11-2017T01:51:17,unsteddyphoenix,ye
07-11-2017T01:52:29,Dadrobit,"In a small saucepan, whisk together the butter, the sugar, half & half, and the beaten egg over low heat. Continue whisking and cooking until the butter has melted and the mixture has thickened slightly (between 5-7 minutes)."
07-11-2017T01:52:37,Dadrobit,"Remove from the heat, and stir in the Jameson"
07-11-2017T01:52:59,Dadrobit,"Whiskey butter sauce, for a desert though"
07-11-2017T01:53:53,unsteddyphoenix,hoo~
07-11-2017T01:54:29,Dadrobit,Also finding some places that recommend mixing cheese sauces with the alchohol.
07-11-2017T01:54:41,Dadrobit,alcohol*
07-11-2017T01:54:52,unsteddyphoenix,"Mm, im getting that too"
07-11-2017T01:54:57,unsteddyphoenix,"Vodka Cream Sauce  3 tbsp. butter 1 clove of garlic, crushed 1 cans of tomato paste ¼ cup of vodka 1 cup heavy cream pinch of red chilli flakes salt and pepper to taste 2 tbsp. sour cream 1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese"
07-11-2017T01:56:07,Dadrobit,"Mouth is literally watering. Stop it, I just ate!"
07-11-2017T01:56:27,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah damn I wanna try this
07-11-2017T01:57:50,Dadrobit,"Dumb question, do you guys have a lot of bourbon variety in NZ, or is it mostly just whiskys?"
07-11-2017T02:00:33,unsteddyphoenix,I...dunno. How many is a lot?
07-11-2017T02:03:12,Dadrobit,"Well, I mean, if I go to even just Wal-Mart, you'll find well over a dozen brands taking up a quarter of the aisle from top to bottom with different variants."
07-11-2017T02:03:50,Dadrobit,"But I know actual bourbon is a very American thing, so I would assume it's not so prevalent elsewhere."
07-11-2017T02:04:52,unsteddyphoenix,I think just everythings bigger in america~
07-11-2017T02:04:56,Dadrobit,Lol
07-11-2017T02:13:30,Dadrobit,"Alright, I'm still sick, and it's past midnight with class still happening tomorrow. Gonna head off to bed now."
07-11-2017T02:13:32,Bgrmystr2,"Every time you guys say Burbon, I think of that time I went to Burbon Street.."
07-11-2017T02:13:37,Dadrobit,Have a good one y'all!
07-11-2017T02:13:40,Bgrmystr2,"Place smelled rancid as fuck, but"
07-11-2017T02:13:43,Bgrmystr2,cool place tho
07-11-2017T02:13:49,Bgrmystr2,Seeya later Dadro
07-11-2017T02:13:54,unsteddyphoenix,gnight~ enjoying your sickness~
07-11-2017T02:14:11,unsteddyphoenix,"Hm. I meant ""enjoy"" actually but that works too."
07-11-2017T02:14:17,Dadrobit,.... Bourbon Street is a strip club out here....
07-11-2017T02:14:26,Bgrmystr2,haha
07-11-2017T02:14:32,Bgrmystr2,Those exist here.
07-11-2017T02:14:37,Bgrmystr2,Probably dozens of them
07-11-2017T02:14:44,unsteddyphoenix,Strip clubs or streets?
07-11-2017T02:14:48,Bgrmystr2,Yes.
07-11-2017T02:15:32,Bgrmystr2,Strip clubs named after streets? Proably..
07-11-2017T02:15:44,Bgrmystr2,Streets named after Strip Clubs? Don't doubt it.
07-11-2017T02:15:46,Dadrobit,o7

07-11-2017T16:44:08,Bgrmystr2,whatever that means.. :thinking:
07-11-2017T16:44:28,MidnightBlue78,"i accidentally typed 14, it has absolutely no meaning"
07-11-2017T16:44:34,MidnightBlue78,xD
07-11-2017T16:44:40,BluePhantom90,lol
07-11-2017T16:47:51,MidnightBlue78,"hmmmmm, i wonder what tonight's stream will consist of? :ctwokinds-natsducky:"
07-11-2017T16:48:29,Bgrmystr2,dunno
07-11-2017T16:55:04,BluePhantom90,uhhh man I come up with funny sketch idea's when I am work. One I think a lot of people might like to see.. maybe
07-11-2017T16:55:26,BadFoMo,Whatis it?
07-11-2017T16:55:32,BadFoMo,*What is
07-11-2017T16:56:18,MidnightBlue78,so today after almost a year i finally put the 13 year tk anniversary poster on a frame. Now i can show it off to everyone
07-11-2017T16:57:06,MidnightBlue78,"My son said it looks really nice, and I told him that Tom worked very hard on it :ctwokinds-rainehappy:"
07-11-2017T16:59:12,BluePhantom90,"Okay Female Markiplier and Flora talk of plan on how to kill Boobs Mackenzie from going on a date with Flora, from the Yandere Simulator"
07-11-2017T16:59:28,BluePhantom90,*with Trace
07-11-2017T16:59:32,BluePhantom90,damn me
07-11-2017T17:00:22,BluePhantom90,though of this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKqX-P2gX7U
07-11-2017T17:01:21,BluePhantom90,Thought What if Trace was the guy Flora was teaming up with Fem-Markiplier to make sure Boobs Mackenzie doesn't go on a date together
07-11-2017T17:13:38,BluePhantom90,-sighs-
07-11-2017T17:21:59,MidnightBlue78,who's Boobs Mackenzie?
07-11-2017T17:22:11,BluePhantom90,its on the video
07-11-2017T17:22:24,MidnightBlue78,Oh:ptv-uneasy:
07-11-2017T17:22:43,BluePhantom90,Mark called the girl in the game that because she was the big boob gir
07-11-2017T17:22:44,MidnightBlue78,"sorry, i derp sometimes"
07-11-2017T17:22:46,BluePhantom90,*girl
07-11-2017T17:23:18,BluePhantom90,its okay
07-11-2017T17:24:23,Bgrmystr2,"Midnight, 14 would have been a good anniversary too.. 1k pages and everything"
07-11-2017T17:24:53,Bgrmystr2,but it seems like anniversary pages are far and few between
07-11-2017T17:26:37,MidnightBlue78,"you know what, i was actually thinking about that a few moments ago lol"
07-11-2017T17:29:05,TheGamePlayer,@Bgrmystr2 I have a question for you
07-11-2017T17:29:57,Bgrmystr2,wassap
07-11-2017T17:30:58,TheGamePlayer,is copying a file considered backing it up?
07-11-2017T17:31:27,Bgrmystr2,"well, if you copy the file to a different drive entirely"
07-11-2017T17:31:32,Bgrmystr2,then technically yes
07-11-2017T17:31:58,Bgrmystr2,"some people consider partitions a way of backing stuff up, but if the drive goes, all partitions go with it."
07-11-2017T17:32:28,Bgrmystr2,so you wanna get important things on multiple drives
07-11-2017T17:32:32,Bgrmystr2,just in case one dies. :&gt;
07-11-2017T17:32:33,TheGamePlayer,im asking because a Mod on nexus wants a backup save of my game file just in case it breaks the game
07-11-2017T17:33:18,TheGamePlayer,ok
07-11-2017T17:33:20,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: is the game online only?
07-11-2017T17:33:26,TheGamePlayer,no
07-11-2017T17:33:33,TheGamePlayer,single player as well
07-11-2017T17:33:36,TheGamePlayer,Dying Light
07-11-2017T17:33:59,Bgrmystr2,"Well, in this case, it's probably a good idea to copy/paste the gamesave somewhere else on your computer"
07-11-2017T17:34:11,Bgrmystr2,so if the game itself breaks due to what happens in the game
07-11-2017T17:34:28,TheGamePlayer,ya thats what i thought ok thanks
07-11-2017T17:34:31,Bgrmystr2,then it's probably a good idea to have a backup elsewhere
07-11-2017T17:34:40,Bgrmystr2,"so you can, you know, not do that thing that broke the game"
07-11-2017T17:34:51,TheGamePlayer,lol
07-11-2017T17:35:32,Bgrmystr2,that's what I do with TerraTech sometimes. save game and let the game's autosave be the source of problems
07-11-2017T17:35:51,Bgrmystr2,"so if I run into a bug, I can send the devs the autosave and they can see the bug"
07-11-2017T17:36:00,Bgrmystr2,and I can revert back to the last savepoint I had
07-11-2017T17:36:01,TheGamePlayer,ooh
07-11-2017T17:36:18,TheGamePlayer,didnt think og that
07-11-2017T17:36:22,Bgrmystr2,and I don't lose that much time :)
07-11-2017T17:36:28,Bgrmystr2,and i just kind of avoid the bug
07-11-2017T17:36:58,Bgrmystr2,"Also, because my savepoint is a specific point in time, I can always start from there and try to replicate the bug"
07-11-2017T17:37:28,Bgrmystr2,which helps in identifying what could be causing it
07-11-2017T17:39:33,TheGamePlayer,oky doky i thing i have it
07-11-2017T17:40:48,TheGamePlayer,i have no Idea if this is the modded game or the regular
07-11-2017T17:41:58,TheGamePlayer,oh should i have put it into the original file or the backup?
07-11-2017T18:12:16,Bgrmystr2,uh? You lost me. xD
07-11-2017T18:12:44,Bgrmystr2,"putting files inside files is where you lose me, cuz that's not usually a thing that happens on save files unless they're archives"
07-11-2017T18:12:51,Bgrmystr2,and I dunno any game that does that besides minecraft

07-11-2017T19:40:59,Bgrmystr2,Nibbly drinking coffee and ending up like Hammie from Over the Hedge?

07-11-2017T19:41:40,unsteddyphoenix,Perhaps a character birthday party?
07-11-2017T19:41:42,unsteddyphoenix,Could be cute
07-11-2017T19:42:10,MidnightBlue78,trace and flora with a gender reveal cake

07-11-2017T19:43:55,unsteddyphoenix,Could draw like a very quick Seraphina origin story
07-11-2017T19:43:58,Dadrobit,Howdy y'all
07-11-2017T19:44:03,unsteddyphoenix,Why she fell in love with draggos

07-11-2017T19:44:43,Dadrobit,"very sick, imbibing in nyquil all day, might not make it through stream entirely"
07-11-2017T19:45:08,unsteddyphoenix,With enough drugs anything is possible
07-11-2017T19:45:09,Dadrobit,"Speaking of, what is the topic for the day?"
07-11-2017T19:45:22,Bgrmystr2,"What's gonna be streamed, if there is a stream, is currently up for debate. Tom's thinking about voting incentive"
07-11-2017T19:45:33,Bgrmystr2,and asked for quick ideas lol
07-11-2017T19:45:37,MidnightBlue78,he's looking for ideas
07-11-2017T19:45:50,Bgrmystr2,"""Short comic ideas"""
07-11-2017T19:45:55,BrunoYcaro,hello everyone
07-11-2017T19:45:57,unsteddyphoenix,And somewhat questionably asked us
07-11-2017T19:45:59,Dadrobit,"Ha, gave him an idea last time, doubt that's gonna be the winner today though."
07-11-2017T19:46:15,Bgrmystr2,heya Bruno
07-11-2017T19:46:18,BrunoYcaro,heya
07-11-2017T19:46:20,Dadrobit,o/ Bruno
07-11-2017T19:46:24,unsteddyphoenix,o/
07-11-2017T19:47:16,Dadrobit,"Hmmmm, speaking of imbibing in drugs, how about some of the feline characters partaking in some catnip?"
07-11-2017T19:47:36,Bgrmystr2,That already happened with flora
07-11-2017T19:47:39,Bgrmystr2,so there is that
07-11-2017T19:48:13,Dadrobit,"Was that a thing? I feel like I almost recall it, but not %100 sure."
07-11-2017T19:48:21,Bgrmystr2,it was a thing.
07-11-2017T19:48:34,unsteddyphoenix,Hm
07-11-2017T19:48:35,MidnightBlue78,i've always thought it would be funny to have karen giving nibbly a ride on a stroller and she's dressed nibbly in a baby outfit
07-11-2017T19:48:45,Bgrmystr2,lesse if I can find it
07-11-2017T19:48:48,unsteddyphoenix,That sounds absurdly cute
07-11-2017T19:48:57,MidnightBlue78,probably really silly but thought  it might be funny
07-11-2017T19:48:58,Bgrmystr2,yeah here it is https://twokinds.deviantart.com/art/Catnip-313263879
07-11-2017T19:49:19,unsteddyphoenix,"Oh, huh."
07-11-2017T19:49:19,Dadrobit,"Ah, indeed"
07-11-2017T19:49:28,unsteddyphoenix,"Still, could work."
07-11-2017T19:49:45,unsteddyphoenix,Perhaps a short comic that gives some exposition?
07-11-2017T19:49:48,BadFoMo,@Twokinds @unsteddyphoenix Seraphina Human into Adrakist or Maddie into Were-Squirral transformation sequince?
07-11-2017T19:50:08,BrunoYcaro,Tom i posted my drawing of Flora on my twitter there is a link here in picarto in case you want to check it out later
07-11-2017T19:50:15,unsteddyphoenix,Isnt she already an adrakist basically?
07-11-2017T19:50:59,unsteddyphoenix,Could have a quick thing that explains magic for instance.
07-11-2017T19:51:04,Dadrobit,I think he meant the first transformation
07-11-2017T19:51:06,TheRedFoxArt,Or... A young Eric and Kat? ^^
07-11-2017T19:51:11,unsteddyphoenix,More Nat-Kat lessons
07-11-2017T19:51:20,unsteddyphoenix,With the last panel obviously being another spell mishap
07-11-2017T19:51:24,unsteddyphoenix,"'cause, thats the good stuff."
07-11-2017T19:51:26,BadFoMo,@unsteddyphoenix What Dadrobit said.
07-11-2017T19:51:41,Bgrmystr2,it still needs to fit a short comic form
07-11-2017T19:52:01,Bgrmystr2,"or, least, that's what he was askin for"
07-11-2017T19:52:16,Bgrmystr2,";u I dunno, tom's been quiet for a bit now"
07-11-2017T19:52:20,unsteddyphoenix,I can see it being short.
07-11-2017T19:52:44,unsteddyphoenix,Nats explaining stuff while Kat's just fiddling with a spell the whole time until the last panel where it misfires
07-11-2017T19:52:59,unsteddyphoenix,Hmm...what else.
07-11-2017T19:55:10,unsteddyphoenix,Hm. Idk. There's so much POTENTIAL.
07-11-2017T19:56:19,TheRedFoxArt,"Well, I'd like to see a mini comic with Eric and Kat in their younger years ^^"
07-11-2017T19:56:26,Dadrobit,How about a picture of Landen and Sealeen enjoying some of their respective hobbies?
07-11-2017T19:57:19,Bgrmystr2,Hmm.. Makes me wonder if tom said that just to make have something to talk about while he runs off and doodles his own thing.. :thinking:
07-11-2017T19:57:36,unsteddyphoenix,Landan obviously being dragged around the whole time
07-11-2017T19:57:37,Bgrmystr2,make us*
07-11-2017T19:58:09,unsteddyphoenix,"Unless he suddenly started enjoying walls of text, unlikely."
07-11-2017T19:58:41,Bgrmystr2,"yeah hence the ""runs off"" part"
07-11-2017T19:58:43,Bgrmystr2,xD
07-11-2017T20:01:30,BadFoMo,"I now have a TF sequence mind-set; and can only think of 'Suddenly Tails', 'Merfolk', 'Half and Half', 'Were-Squirral Maddie', 'Seraphina's First Transformation' and 'Naga Kathrin and Eric'."
07-11-2017T20:02:23,Dadrobit,I like to think that Landen has a massive collection of novelty coffee mugs that he takes great pride in. :)
07-11-2017T20:03:09,unsteddyphoenix,"Lol you THINK his interest is coffee, but he actually just thinks coffee is ""ok"" and is all about the novelty mugs"
07-11-2017T20:03:12,Dadrobit,"And when he sets them out across the shelves, it literally becomes a wall of text."
07-11-2017T20:03:28,Bgrmystr2,"XD phoenix ""NOONE MUST EVER KNOW"""

07-11-2017T20:07:30,Bgrmystr2,unless he gets more mugs than he leaves behind?
07-11-2017T20:08:23,Dadrobit,"Of course, what else is he going to spend the money on?"
07-11-2017T20:08:38,Bgrmystr2,but then.. why would he leave cups behind if he's buying them?
07-11-2017T20:08:51,Dadrobit,Brb
07-11-2017T20:08:53,unsteddyphoenix,He leaves behind his spares
07-11-2017T20:09:02,Bgrmystr2,lool

07-11-2017T20:09:20,unsteddyphoenix,Ofc
07-11-2017T20:09:44,Bgrmystr2,and then something happens to the cup collection
07-11-2017T20:09:54,Bgrmystr2,and that's the end of it
07-11-2017T20:10:08,Bgrmystr2,has no spare cups just in case.
07-11-2017T20:10:59,unsteddyphoenix,That is the beginning of the end.
07-11-2017T20:11:07,unsteddyphoenix,And we find out...the TRUE villian of twokinds
07-11-2017T20:11:11,BadFoMo,He trades his spares with the target's?
07-11-2017T20:11:51,Bgrmystr2,He leaves his spares there.. so he can TRACK every single cup
07-11-2017T20:11:53,Bgrmystr2,where it goes

07-11-2017T20:17:35,Bgrmystr2,that poor robot though..
07-11-2017T20:17:56,qwe304,i loved the OWB dlc
07-11-2017T20:19:52,qwe304,"if someone ever asks you for your IP, tell them it is 192.168.1.1"
07-11-2017T20:20:41,Bgrmystr2,xDD

07-11-2017T20:21:02,Bgrmystr2,or 1.0
07-11-2017T20:21:12,BadFoMo,I don't get it.
07-11-2017T20:21:36,Bgrmystr2,that's the natural IP address of the local router
07-11-2017T20:21:38,Bgrmystr2,usually
07-11-2017T20:21:52,Bgrmystr2,it's generally the same across the board by default

07-11-2017T20:23:01,Bgrmystr2,cuz they'll know how to get it
07-11-2017T20:25:19,TheRedFoxArt,xD Nice
07-11-2017T20:28:08,qwe304,@Bgrmystr2 it'd probably be enough to confuse a 14y/o running kalilinux
07-11-2017T20:29:08,Dadrobit,"Okay, here's an idea. What about Mike fantasizing about being able to actually pay for and own things for himself for the first time in his life. Lots of d'awwww potential there no?"

07-11-2017T21:14:11,unsteddyphoenix,Trace carrying Flora and desperately trying to pretend that she isnt way heavier

07-11-2017T21:14:34,BadFoMo,@Bgrmystr2 I meant as a story.
07-11-2017T21:14:37,Bgrmystr2,"people are attempting to think of ideas for the next Voting Incentive, Torque"
07-11-2017T21:14:42,MidnightBlue78,trace and flora putting the crib together
07-11-2017T21:14:44,BluePhantom90,"7.	Alternate Reality Flora owns Trace as a slave, and Trace begins to fall for Flora."

07-11-2017T21:14:57,Dadrobit,#QualityTheft

07-11-2017T21:15:43,BadFoMo,"Also, I think I had an idea simmlar to that."
07-11-2017T21:15:52,Dadrobit,"I kinda like the crib building idea, could be fun to watch them figuring that out."
07-11-2017T21:16:16,TorqueEmUp,Yup at the theater right now. We got here a bit early. :stuck_out_tongue:
07-11-2017T21:16:19,Zakuru,do we have clarification?
07-11-2017T21:16:26,BluePhantom90,I had a funny idea with Nat and Keith do a Double Date with Flora and Trace.
07-11-2017T21:16:31,Bgrmystr2,"of what, Zak?"
07-11-2017T21:16:39,Zakuru,"to stream, or not to stream"

07-11-2017T21:17:07,Twokinds,Today is now
07-11-2017T21:17:12,RichterApokalypse,:v
07-11-2017T21:17:21,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Thought today was 5 minutes ago
07-11-2017T21:17:22,unsteddyphoenix,I....thiiiiink that answers my question.

07-11-2017T21:17:39,TorqueEmUp,"Ah, no stream again? Bummer"
07-11-2017T21:17:44,Zakuru,so i guess I'll have no distractions so i can actually do my homework today
07-11-2017T21:17:46,Twokinds,Don't let your todays be tomorrows
07-11-2017T21:17:47,Dadrobit,"""today is now"" sounds like lyrics you's find in a Beatles song."
07-11-2017T21:17:53,MidnightBlue78,:ctwokinds-reniderp:
07-11-2017T21:17:55,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD

07-11-2017T21:18:20,MidnightBlue78,make your tomorrows today
07-11-2017T21:18:33,BluePhantom90,I am still figuring out what would Nat and Keith want to do. Keith I thought Groom resort but doesn't sound like him
07-11-2017T21:18:39,unsteddyphoenix,Time is circular that's why clocks are round
07-11-2017T21:18:50,CrRAR,lol

07-11-2017T21:19:40,BadFoMo,"Dang, a little late."
07-11-2017T21:20:04,unsteddyphoenix,So basically what ive gotten from this
07-11-2017T21:20:10,unsteddyphoenix,Is that the stream will start in 3 hours
07-11-2017T21:20:24,unsteddyphoenix,got it
07-11-2017T21:20:42,Dadrobit,But 3 hours from now is still today...
07-11-2017T21:20:49,Bgrmystr2,not according to Tom
07-11-2017T21:20:52,Bgrmystr2,and that's what matters.

07-11-2017T21:24:17,qwe304,the files are perfectly synced
07-11-2017T21:24:18,BluePhantom90,yeah its insync for me
07-11-2017T21:24:19,Bgrmystr2,because internet.
07-11-2017T21:24:47,MarvTheHugPharaoh,its weird seeing floras left eye turn in to a butt

07-11-2017T21:26:12,MarvTheHugPharaoh,how so?
07-11-2017T21:26:18,qwe304,"it took me like an hour to decompile the gif, cut each frame into 4 and make 4 new gifs"
07-11-2017T21:27:10,Bgrmystr2,it will still be out of sync for most people more often than not because you can't control the speed of data that's outside of your network connection speed.
07-11-2017T21:28:52,BadFoMo,I now have Flora's head and butt murging in and out of themeselves.
07-11-2017T21:29:10,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Eek!

07-11-2017T21:29:30,Bgrmystr2,Never go full derp.
07-11-2017T21:29:31,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Flora heard someone talking behind her back
07-11-2017T21:29:39,Dadrobit,"Yo, NSYNC's It's Gonna Be Me music video, creepy AF."

07-11-2017T21:32:19,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I find it funny that a bunch of G I Joes rope down to fight Nsync
07-11-2017T21:33:06,Dadrobit,"The make-up in on point though, if a bit uncanny-valley"
07-11-2017T21:34:21,MarvTheHugPharaoh,it is a tad bit creepy how plastic they look
07-11-2017T21:35:18,BadFoMo,"//Troll Wait, doesn't Book 1 have extra pages? So we've sort of passed the 1000th page before the 14th anaversery?"
07-11-2017T21:35:26,CrRAR,How's the progress thus far?
07-11-2017T21:37:29,Combak,"I think Tom wants to do a new vote incentive today, but is having trouble coming up with ideas."
07-11-2017T21:37:41,Dadrobit,:( I feel old... Everybody from Backstreet Boys came out 20 years ago.....
07-11-2017T21:38:11,Combak,"I'd throw up the Reni idea again, but I'm pretty sure he wants something simple, not a whole mini-comic. XD"
07-11-2017T21:38:11,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"wow, I was 1 at the time"
07-11-2017T21:38:13,MidnightBlue78,yikes!!!! it's been that long!?!?
07-11-2017T21:38:36,Combak,Everybody in the Backstreet Boys was gay?
07-11-2017T21:38:46,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"XD, the song everybody"
07-11-2017T21:38:48,Bgrmystr2,You don't say Combak xDD... I mean that was the first thing that tom said several hours ago
07-11-2017T21:38:50,MidnightBlue78,xD
07-11-2017T21:38:53,Bgrmystr2,and that's when the chat started
07-11-2017T21:39:03,Dadrobit,"I remember when it came out, watched it on MTV. Was 5 or 6 at the time."
07-11-2017T21:39:17,Dadrobit,My sister was so unbelievably into them
07-11-2017T21:39:31,Combak,Some people may have arrived.
07-11-2017T21:39:32,MidnightBlue78,i was a teenager way back then :ctwokinds-keith8D:
07-11-2017T21:39:41,BadFoMo,@Combak How about a part 2? 74.	Trace (being controlled by ‘Mini Nora’) versus Flora (still being controlled by Nibbly) in a city of cardboard boxes.
07-11-2017T21:39:49,Bgrmystr2,I don't see anyone new
07-11-2017T21:39:55,Dadrobit,"And the Gay parody was ""I want it that way"" I think"

07-11-2017T21:41:55,BluePhantom90,well after my sketch idea gets drawn I was thinking Flora Fort part 2. Flora conquer the Kitchen. Rose questioning Trace and Reni notice Flora is eyeing her as shes dinner.
07-11-2017T21:42:39,Dadrobit,Ace Of Base -All That She Wants in suggested. Yes please.

07-11-2017T21:53:22,BadFoMo,BRB.
07-11-2017T21:55:52,Combak,"@BadFoMo, I was referring to the ""Reni checks the memories of Trace's other guests"" idea."
07-11-2017T21:56:21,Combak,"... Hey Tom, you reading chat ATM? Got two quick questions for ya."
07-11-2017T21:57:08,BluePhantom90,"Had one with Kat asks Princess Reni, to fix her infertility. Finds out why Nat hated being in heat"
07-11-2017T21:58:13,BadFoMo,That might be NSFW.
07-11-2017T21:58:19,Combak,^
07-11-2017T21:59:53,Twokinds,Reni can't use magic.
07-11-2017T22:00:05,BadFoMo,She can't?
07-11-2017T22:00:11,Combak,... Say what?
07-11-2017T22:00:44,Combak,"Are dragons, like, creatures of pure magic?"
07-11-2017T22:00:49,Combak,*Aren't
07-11-2017T22:00:56,Combak,Or is that just Nora?
07-11-2017T22:01:09,Bgrmystr2,"according to lore, they are. Or at least, should be"
07-11-2017T22:01:57,Bgrmystr2,I dunno if that entails automatic-knowledge or ability to use it.
07-11-2017T22:02:00,BluePhantom90,"well I ment as in a joke see Kat locked in her room saying "" I Regret my deission!"""
07-11-2017T22:02:25,Twokinds,That's not... no
07-11-2017T22:03:08,BluePhantom90,lol so how dose Nora turn a man into a Female horse? or Mare if we want to be correct?
07-11-2017T22:03:57,Twokinds,Because Nora is 2000 years old and Reni's a baby by comparison.
07-11-2017T22:04:04,BrunoYcaro,"Tom i think you missed when i said it,i posted the drawing of military flora in my twitter there is a link for it here in my channel in picarto if you want to check it out later"
07-11-2017T22:04:10,BluePhantom90,I thought 400?
07-11-2017T22:04:19,BrunoYcaro,"gtg,bye people!"
07-11-2017T22:04:38,BadFoMo,Why not post it here?BrunoYcaro
07-11-2017T22:04:48,Combak,"... Is this a case of ""can't right now"" being taken as ""can't ever"" Tom?"
07-11-2017T22:04:50,Twokinds,400? Noooo
07-11-2017T22:04:52,BluePhantom90,oh nvm. yeah
07-11-2017T22:04:53,BadFoMo,@BrunoYcaro Why not post it here?
07-11-2017T22:04:57,BluePhantom90,lol
07-11-2017T22:05:16,BrunoYcaro,idk how to doi tho im new by here
07-11-2017T22:05:23,BrunoYcaro,do it*
07-11-2017T22:05:31,Combak,Just paste the link in the text box.
07-11-2017T22:05:43,Bgrmystr2,"lol, that's what happens combak xD"
07-11-2017T22:05:50,MidnightBlue78,legitimate question here from me...do dragons die?
07-11-2017T22:05:53,unsteddyphoenix,Is nora the oldest dragon?
07-11-2017T22:05:59,Combak,"Teddy, yes."
07-11-2017T22:06:36,Combak,Tom has said she's about as powerful as the Masks... Or at least is the next step down from them.
07-11-2017T22:08:04,unsteddyphoenix,I know shes powerful but that doesnt necessarily mean shes the oldest
07-11-2017T22:08:19,unsteddyphoenix,Nora is a special case
07-11-2017T22:08:31,Combak,"By the way, the two questions I wanted to ask: 1. Reni took Seraphina to the Estate, right? Or was it the jail? 2. What's the story behind the one mention of the Wolf Pens during the Edinmire attack? Cut story line?"
07-11-2017T22:09:01,Bgrmystr2,Story line that hasn't been followed up yet
07-11-2017T22:09:27,Twokinds,All the dragon stuff is spoilers
07-11-2017T22:09:35,Bgrmystr2,"the Wolf Pens are literally pens. They're trying to free the wolves, and probably did so"
07-11-2017T22:09:40,BluePhantom90,awwww
07-11-2017T22:09:41,Combak,Including Sera?
07-11-2017T22:09:50,MidnightBlue78,dang it!
07-11-2017T22:09:53,BluePhantom90,well can Dragon shed their scales?
07-11-2017T22:10:01,BadFoMo,@Twokinds How so?
07-11-2017T22:10:08,BluePhantom90,seems like a simple one there
07-11-2017T22:10:11,Dadrobit,Wolf pens are the guard barracks re-purposed as a holding center.
07-11-2017T22:10:13,Bgrmystr2,"Because.. spoilers, Fomo?"
07-11-2017T22:10:20,Bgrmystr2,relevant to the story in the future
07-11-2017T22:10:20,Combak,"FoMo, THAT'S spoilers!"
07-11-2017T22:10:29,Twokinds,Serah is spoilers too
07-11-2017T22:10:37,Bgrmystr2,hahaha
07-11-2017T22:10:39,Bgrmystr2,damnit
07-11-2017T22:10:39,Twokinds,Everything is spoilers
07-11-2017T22:10:46,Combak,*spiders. :p
07-11-2017T22:10:49,BluePhantom90,lol awww
07-11-2017T22:11:01,BadFoMo,@Combak @Bgrmystr2 Shh! I'm trying to trick him!
07-11-2017T22:11:05,MidnightBlue78,"well, we tried"
07-11-2017T22:11:14,Bgrmystr2,it's.. not gonna work
07-11-2017T22:11:15,BluePhantom90,Well Is my question to spoiler? About Dragons Shedding their scales?
07-11-2017T22:11:35,Twokinds,Whether it's spoilers or not is a spoiler
07-11-2017T22:11:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,questions are spoilers?
07-11-2017T22:11:45,BadFoMo,Curses! Foiled again!
07-11-2017T22:11:56,Bgrmystr2,"apparently, marv"
07-11-2017T22:12:06,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, they could be"
07-11-2017T22:12:22,Combak,"Hey, there's an idea. Tom, the master puppeteer, directing his characters."
07-11-2017T22:12:31,MarvTheHugPharaoh,what about questions on theoretical physics?
07-11-2017T22:12:47,Dadrobit,"This might be a little bit spoiler-y, but, how does the story end?"

07-11-2017T22:13:54,Bgrmystr2,"what does it say, Bruno"
07-11-2017T22:13:56,Combak,"It had a few, last I recall."
07-11-2017T22:14:02,Twokinds,The story ends with rocks falling
07-11-2017T22:14:04,Dadrobit,Never finished Wolf's Rain sadly
