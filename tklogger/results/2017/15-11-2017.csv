15-11-2017T00:00:47,Serpentfrog,"Did you make that, Spot? That's pretty good."

15-11-2017T00:01:00,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Thats awesome stuff, pls teach"

15-11-2017T00:02:42,MidnightBlue78,Not bad at all Spot
15-11-2017T00:05:03,SpotTheLeopard,"Tom, the tricky thing I see between the panels is reversing the curve of the spine for the pose, so I sketched it with a double impact where the bounce flops the spine in the direction I think you're going for"
15-11-2017T00:05:37,Bgrmystr2,that impact would be intense though.
15-11-2017T00:05:45,Bgrmystr2,Reni is gonna feel that.

15-11-2017T01:41:45,Serpentfrog,Only in the mind are we children.
15-11-2017T01:41:46,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I'm a young lad

15-11-2017T01:42:01,Bgrmystr2,but you're not wrong
15-11-2017T01:42:47,Serpentfrog,It is fun to stay up at the... Twokinds stream chat.

15-11-2017T01:44:08,Twokinds,:ptv-uneasy:
15-11-2017T01:44:15,Bgrmystr2,but it's actually more likely you can find at least one person active here about 75% of the time.
15-11-2017T01:44:17,FenceEqualizer,With how people lurk you'd think it'd be 24/7
15-11-2017T01:44:19,Twokinds,need something like this

15-11-2017T01:46:25,unsteddyphoenix,I dont really see any difference
15-11-2017T01:46:27,Bgrmystr2,cuz flora doesn't derp in a happy way
15-11-2017T01:46:31,Bgrmystr2,she derps angrily
15-11-2017T01:46:39,Bgrmystr2,she doesn't get so happy she goes full derp
15-11-2017T01:46:47,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, noone's suggested it"
15-11-2017T01:46:54,Bgrmystr2,and it's never happened in the comic

15-11-2017T01:48:07,Bgrmystr2,xD
15-11-2017T01:48:19,Sunfish43,IDK I thought it was just in general
15-11-2017T01:48:49,Dadrobit,Don't judge me. I'm tired and full of bad descisions.

15-11-2017T01:51:20,Dadrobit,The closest is the one i posted earlier w/ the merchant
15-11-2017T01:51:25,Dadrobit,I think
15-11-2017T01:51:28,Serpentfrog,Is it 11:51 there?
15-11-2017T01:51:37,Sunfish43,Maybe child like innocence?
15-11-2017T01:51:37,Bgrmystr2,"yeah see maddie isn't really shifty, but more crafty"
15-11-2017T01:51:50,BadFoMo,I have 1:51
15-11-2017T01:51:53,BadFoMo,AM.
15-11-2017T01:51:53,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah probably, but Steve the merchant probably would just confused people"
15-11-2017T01:51:55,Sunfish43,It's 1:51 am in the big OH
15-11-2017T01:52:01,MarvTheHugPharaoh,11:51pm for me
15-11-2017T01:52:15,unsteddyphoenix,"I mean she never LOOKS shifty or crafty. She's always got the ""innocent"" thing going on."
15-11-2017T01:52:29,FenceEqualizer,It's the wide eyes.
15-11-2017T01:52:32,Bgrmystr2,yeah that is true
15-11-2017T01:52:47,Bgrmystr2,it's cuz I don't think she does it with the intention of harm
15-11-2017T01:52:49,Dadrobit,http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/658/

15-11-2017T01:53:26,unsteddyphoenix,He merchants on the side
15-11-2017T01:53:30,MarvTheHugPharaoh,thinks of Apothecary Man! suggestions
15-11-2017T01:53:40,Bgrmystr2,Those who tend to have a really good shifty or crafy look usually end up doing it on purpose. Knowingly at the expense of others.
15-11-2017T01:54:08,unsteddyphoenix,maybe Evals or Mike? Theyve spent most of the comic nervous.
15-11-2017T01:54:16,Dadrobit,http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/613/
15-11-2017T01:54:30,Serpentfrog,I shall search my sketch screencaps.
15-11-2017T01:54:31,Dadrobit,But it's impossible to know it's her specifically.
15-11-2017T01:54:34,FenceEqualizer,Not sure that counts.
15-11-2017T01:55:03,FenceEqualizer,Yeah to those who didn't read the comic. That may just be a very angry barrel.
15-11-2017T01:55:09,unsteddyphoenix,Ugh Eric just let her eat something.
15-11-2017T01:55:12,unsteddyphoenix,Douche.
15-11-2017T01:55:52,Bgrmystr2,that barrel image is a good lurker one though
15-11-2017T01:56:01,Serpentfrog,Do you remember baka Eric? That should be an emote.
15-11-2017T01:56:12,MarvTheHugPharaoh,lol

15-11-2017T01:57:24,Serpentfrog,Umm... Marv if I send you the picture can you make an imgur link for it?
15-11-2017T01:57:31,Dadrobit,http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/884/ The last panel's expression out of context could be kinda shifty.

15-11-2017T18:56:03,MrsNibbly,"stream on one screen, game on middle, then music on another, chat on one laptop and discord on the other"
15-11-2017T18:56:05,SpotTheLeopard,One computer is for stream watching

15-11-2017T18:56:26,Bgrmystr2,there are some things one single computer cannot always do
15-11-2017T18:56:33,SpotTheLeopard,The other is for the task you're supposed to be doing but are too distracted by the stream
15-11-2017T18:56:37,Serpentfrog,Get a better computer.
15-11-2017T18:56:40,Bgrmystr2,especially when there's hardware limitations.

15-11-2017T21:34:00,CrRAR,...but not in common english
15-11-2017T21:34:01,Serpentfrog,So? I've read a book with no capitalization or punctuation.

15-11-2017T23:17:17,BluePhantom90,Oh so you were working on the Page Tom? Embarrassed by it are you?
15-11-2017T23:17:40,Twokinds,Huh?
15-11-2017T23:17:47,Twokinds,What do you mean?

15-11-2017T23:25:14,Twokinds,Yeah
15-11-2017T23:25:24,Twokinds,I almost always sketch the page before the stream.
15-11-2017T23:25:51,BluePhantom90,huh I figured you already had it sketch from those few pages ago?
15-11-2017T23:26:00,Twokinds,Because it's a long process of redoing over and over. I've been working this page for two days.
15-11-2017T23:26:03,Twokinds,It'd be a long stream.
15-11-2017T23:26:07,Combak,Probably redid... Yep.
15-11-2017T23:26:10,CrRAR,mmm
15-11-2017T23:26:18,CrRAR,lotsa brainstormin
15-11-2017T23:26:26,BluePhantom90,we all wouldn't mind seeing how you all sketch
15-11-2017T23:26:37,Twokinds,"No, it's seriously really boring."
15-11-2017T23:26:42,Combak,"Out of curiousity, how many different versions of the page do you have?"
15-11-2017T23:26:46,Bgrmystr2,sketchwork for comics is a long process. It's not something one would stream and expect to be done in a few hours.
15-11-2017T23:26:52,CrRAR,^
15-11-2017T23:27:05,Twokinds,"It's a lot of... dead air, as I look up references and... think."
15-11-2017T23:27:12,BluePhantom90,"Tom, I think some of us have watched ""How its made"" it can be boring. But your work its interesting"
15-11-2017T23:27:14,Combak,I.E. Still have access to. I'm wondering about how much it changed.
15-11-2017T23:27:37,Combak,"Phantom, ""How its Made"" would be more interesting."
15-11-2017T23:27:41,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno combak, probably a lot of renditions existed, but he may have just not saved them."
15-11-2017T23:27:59,Combak,Especially since Tom might not want to show us as he looks up some references.
15-11-2017T23:28:08,Bgrmystr2,"a lot of artists I see tend to sketch something, redo a part they don't like, pick the one they do like, and delete the old one"
15-11-2017T23:28:17,Combak,"Or might not be able to, now that I think about it."
15-11-2017T23:28:19,Bgrmystr2,and then move on from there
15-11-2017T23:28:43,Combak,"I know that bgr, I'm asking just in case."
15-11-2017T23:28:44,Bgrmystr2,"so there'd be a lot of different parts of the sketch along the time they draw it, from early to late"
15-11-2017T23:28:46,Bgrmystr2,xD
15-11-2017T23:28:55,Bgrmystr2,dunno how many tom would actually have saved lol
15-11-2017T23:29:23,BluePhantom90,lol we all  could help you Tom if you let us.
15-11-2017T23:29:46,CrRAR,this isn't twitch tho lol
15-11-2017T23:29:59,Twokinds,Streaming under pressure is not fun for me. I don't enjoy it.
15-11-2017T23:30:14,Twokinds,Creativity can't really be forced. It just sometimes has to come out.
15-11-2017T23:30:18,Combak,The references he was going to be looking up would be hard to find Phantom.
15-11-2017T23:31:00,BluePhantom90,Tom you can relax we are not like Japan and their Fan base. We all relax and cool right guys?

15-11-2017T23:36:28,Serpentfrog,Unforgivable.
15-11-2017T23:36:35,CrRAR,:&lt;
15-11-2017T23:36:56,BluePhantom90,"Plus Bill isn't a scientist, Hes got a engineers degree."
15-11-2017T23:37:05,CrRAR,mmm
15-11-2017T23:37:20,CrRAR,Just got good explainin' skillz
15-11-2017T23:37:37,CrRAR,and excellent EMPHASIS
15-11-2017T23:37:42,Bgrmystr2,everyone I know still thinks he's a real scientist.
15-11-2017T23:37:44,Bgrmystr2,baffles me
15-11-2017T23:37:48,CrRAR,XD
15-11-2017T23:37:52,Bgrmystr2,"been debunked for years, many a time"
15-11-2017T23:38:05,CrRAR,If he was a real scientist he wouldn't be on TV.
15-11-2017T23:38:10,CrRAR,he'd be...
15-11-2017T23:38:17,CrRAR,researchin stuff
15-11-2017T23:38:22,CrRAR,n junk
15-11-2017T23:38:45,CrRAR,n stuff
15-11-2017T23:39:08,CrRAR,"boyyy, do I crack myself up."
15-11-2017T23:39:15,Bgrmystr2,things n stuff n junk n shit ;v
15-11-2017T23:39:21,CrRAR,lol
15-11-2017T23:40:21,BluePhantom90,"I laughed more when women were complaining about not having enough ""Wind-turbines"" and they were told those kill birds. Then the girls go ""But We are more important then Birds""!"
15-11-2017T23:41:23,Bgrmystr2,They called her.. the Wind Turbine :V
15-11-2017T23:41:23,CrRAR,Wind Turbines: They'll scare your cat!
15-11-2017T23:41:34,Bgrmystr2,grand total of zero people in this chat will get that reference.
15-11-2017T23:41:50,Combak,"Unfortunately, you need SOMEONE to explain science stuff to the layman."
15-11-2017T23:41:55,CrRAR,"yeah, one non-getter here."
15-11-2017T23:43:04,CrRAR,"probably karma, cuz I constantly say wacky non-nonsensical things."
15-11-2017T23:43:09,BluePhantom90,Well Wind Turbines kill a lot of birds because they can't hear or see them. Thus they get killed. And we might put the Bold eagle back to extinction levels since they died because of them
15-11-2017T23:43:53,Combak,I'm pretty sure they learn to avoid them.
15-11-2017T23:44:14,Bgrmystr2,Uncommon to most people.. Birds actually do have eyes
15-11-2017T23:44:18,BluePhantom90,Kinda hard to learn when you died
15-11-2017T23:44:19,Bgrmystr2,and can see.
15-11-2017T23:44:33,CrRAR,bless their hearts
15-11-2017T23:44:36,Combak,Learn by example.
15-11-2017T23:45:00,CrRAR,reap what you sow?
15-11-2017T23:45:08,BluePhantom90,um well can you see a big spinning blades about to hit you from under or above you?
15-11-2017T23:45:19,Bgrmystr2,"also, wind turbines don't always spin fast enough."
15-11-2017T23:45:28,CrRAR,yeah
15-11-2017T23:45:47,Bgrmystr2,usually they're not built to withstand high speed winds.
15-11-2017T23:45:53,CrRAR,Lots even have brakes to stop them from spinning too fast in extreme winds
15-11-2017T23:45:57,CrRAR,yeah
15-11-2017T23:45:58,Bgrmystr2,exactly
15-11-2017T23:46:07,CrRAR,They's wobble apart
15-11-2017T23:46:10,Bgrmystr2,birds are what really fly into em
15-11-2017T23:46:11,CrRAR,*they'd

15-11-2017T23:48:59,Bgrmystr2,"""oh look an entire open sky. lets fly around the spinning blades of death instead.ï»¿"" Says one comment."
15-11-2017T23:49:04,Bgrmystr2,Literally my thoughts on it.
15-11-2017T23:49:11,CrRAR,oh god
15-11-2017T23:49:13,CrRAR,lol
15-11-2017T23:49:35,CrRAR,It's...natural selection at it's finest!
15-11-2017T23:49:52,CrRAR,Birds that avoid the blades will live long and peosper.
15-11-2017T23:50:01,CrRAR,*prosper
15-11-2017T23:51:50,Bgrmystr2,"also, the bird dosn't explode"
15-11-2017T23:51:52,Bgrmystr2,or anything
15-11-2017T23:51:54,Bgrmystr2,so yknow
15-11-2017T23:51:58,Bgrmystr2,whatever.
15-11-2017T23:52:12,CrRAR,awww
15-11-2017T23:52:42,Bgrmystr2,"hell, the bird would probably live if someone actually got it to a medical center that cares for birds."
15-11-2017T23:52:53,Bgrmystr2,presuming it didn't just get the wind knocked out of it
15-11-2017T23:53:09,CrRAR,lol I was just literally typing that
15-11-2017T23:53:52,CrRAR,An animal shelter could help mend its wing if it was just that
15-11-2017T23:53:56,Twokinds,The turbine stole it's wind! We're harnessing the bird lifeforce for energy!
15-11-2017T23:54:00,Twokinds,The birdmanity!
15-11-2017T23:54:12,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-laugh:
15-11-2017T23:54:17,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
15-11-2017T23:54:19,Bgrmystr2,"brutal, tom"
15-11-2017T23:54:28,CrRAR,lol
15-11-2017T23:54:37,CrRAR,The truth REVEALED
15-11-2017T23:55:07,CrRAR,Also that bird could have just been the Don Quixote of birds.
15-11-2017T23:55:39,CrRAR,"Takin on windmills, thinking they're dragons or some shiz"
15-11-2017T23:56:12,CrRAR,bird be trippin
15-11-2017T23:57:24,Twokinds,dragons v windmills
15-11-2017T23:57:48,CrRAR,sounds like a blockbuster
15-11-2017T23:57:55,MarvTheHugPharaoh,$10 on windmills
15-11-2017T23:58:03,Twokinds,Reni can't get to Group B. Clovis set up windmills! D:
15-11-2017T23:58:17,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
15-11-2017T23:58:20,CrRAR,EVASIVE MANUVERS!
15-11-2017T23:58:36,CrRAR,damn him and his endless resources!
15-11-2017T23:59:32,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock: *[Somebody set us up the Windmill!]
15-11-2017T23:59:44,Twokinds,That's the real reason why fantasy airships have so many random slowly rotating blades. It's the ward off dragons.
