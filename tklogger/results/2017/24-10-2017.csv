24-10-2017T14:55:47,TorqueEmUp,Midnight did that first. :P
24-10-2017T14:56:00,TorqueEmUp,Bootleg dancing Nibbly.
24-10-2017T14:56:09,TorqueEmUp,:musical_note::chipmunk:
24-10-2017T15:35:37,MidnightBlue78,is the pioneer of the bootleg Dancing Nibbly
24-10-2017T17:48:24,Combak,I think I did :chipmink: first...
24-10-2017T17:48:31,Combak,:chipmunk:
24-10-2017T17:48:48,Combak,"So, stream tonight, right?"
24-10-2017T17:52:37,Bgrmystr2,"Tis the schedule, yes"
24-10-2017T17:52:43,Bgrmystr2,but remains to be seen
24-10-2017T18:00:56,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Tom said we was gonna take a break this week, so most likely no stream tonight.  But I can be very, very wrong :ctwokinds-rainehappy:"
24-10-2017T18:01:59,BluePhantom90,"I can tell most of us are all like ""Oh boy oh boy oh boy! Tom's streaming today!!!"""
24-10-2017T18:20:42,Combak,I assumed he meant no Sunday or Friday stream when he said that. I think he mentioned wanting to get page 1000 done.
24-10-2017T18:21:22,Bgrmystr2,"uhh, I dunno Blue"
24-10-2017T18:21:27,Bgrmystr2,I think it just might be you.
24-10-2017T18:21:58,Combak,As a side note: Does anyone think the current page should have been a flashback that occurs after Reni arrives? It'd make sense for it to be Nat explaining what happened... and might flow better too.
24-10-2017T18:22:30,Bgrmystr2,Eh. I dunno
24-10-2017T18:22:58,Bgrmystr2,"Flashbacks never seem to be done very well imo, so I'm pretty indifferent."

24-10-2017T19:44:17,Zakuru,saw my ex in public OwO
24-10-2017T19:44:48,BluePhantom90,Anyone watched Hellsing Ultimate? Anyone notice people have more blood then they should have in their entire body
24-10-2017T19:45:46,Twokinds,You mean people don't really die in bloodsplosions?
24-10-2017T19:46:54,MarvTheHugPharaoh,more like a bloodpoof
24-10-2017T19:46:58,MidnightBlue78,Bloodplosions is a thing?
24-10-2017T19:47:06,katadom,"tom, just want to say that your writing/storytelling has also improved over the years not just your art."
24-10-2017T19:47:09,BluePhantom90,that and the fact they bleed for like 3 or 5 min after they lose a arm and legs. In fact you would go into shock and possibly die in like 1 min

24-10-2017T20:52:17,MidnightBlue78,i think....
24-10-2017T20:52:22,Bgrmystr2,Atm better than I was 10 mins ago :c
24-10-2017T20:53:48,ViscariaSongbird,:grinning:
24-10-2017T20:53:55,DarthKeidran,"Thank heavens Natani didn‚Äôt Faint again, We can‚Äôt afford another year of unconsciousness."
24-10-2017T20:53:59,dartvader48,ayy vis
24-10-2017T20:54:33,FoxxTrotter,"OK, BBL."
24-10-2017T20:55:42,DarthKeidran,I need to figure out all these tricks of the trade so I can punch out my TwoKinds/Star wars The Last Journey/Jedi poster.
24-10-2017T20:55:58,ViscariaSongbird,"I return, and I see PROGRESS"
24-10-2017T20:56:07,dartvader48,and streams
24-10-2017T20:56:18,DarthKeidran,I would sAy Natani facing right is better than away from Keith.
24-10-2017T20:56:34,BaronVonDrachen,Praise be unto the glorious 1000th page stream
24-10-2017T20:56:58,Corinthian,It's amazing how it hasn't been that long in the comic. Like months have passed. Yet it's been going on for 14 years.
24-10-2017T20:57:22,BluePhantom90,Wonder if Tom will just slam us with pages. since he did do the one where Reni is flying with the characters in that sack of hers
24-10-2017T20:57:40,dartvader48,i should've start reading tk since i was 4
24-10-2017T20:57:49,BluePhantom90,lol
24-10-2017T20:57:54,Bgrmystr2,"There will prolly be a few pages in between now and then, Blue."
24-10-2017T20:57:56,DarthKeidran,"Now I‚Äôm split. I want to make a fan-made movie poster, but also want to make a fan-made 14th anniversary banner for Tom."
24-10-2017T20:57:59,Combak,I think he scrapped that page...
24-10-2017T20:58:03,BluePhantom90,No because you would have to wait for every page
24-10-2017T20:58:08,dartvader48,yeah
24-10-2017T20:58:18,dartvader48,i love the wait tho
24-10-2017T20:58:27,Corinthian,Twokinds began when I was 3. I wish I found it sooner.
24-10-2017T20:58:30,BadFoMo,@DarthKeidran Why not both?
24-10-2017T20:58:40,MuonNeutrino,"i dont think he *scrapped* it, just it might not come quite yet"
24-10-2017T20:58:52,MuonNeutrino,it still makes sense as something to happen a couple pages from now
24-10-2017T20:59:06,BluePhantom90,Not me... well besides when I was Afghanistan. I was like a day behind Tom updated his page. so I got it a day ahead lol
24-10-2017T20:59:10,MidnightBlue78,it was just a teaser
24-10-2017T20:59:25,DarthKeidran,"@BadFoMo Yes, but being a new homeowner sucks. I don‚Äôt have as much time as I thought I would due to getting ready for winter."
24-10-2017T21:00:08,MviluUatusun,"Well, everyone, it's 10:00 here and I have to get up at 3:30 - 4:00 in the morning.  So, I'm going to head off to bed now.  I'll see y'all later."
