28-10-2017T13:58:56,BluePhantom90,guess Tom is looking over the color sketches... Is there another three way Tie?
28-10-2017T14:01:15,Combak,We're supposed to start in an hour...
28-10-2017T14:02:46,Kinipshun,i hope pet daughter makes it
28-10-2017T14:03:17,Combak,I'm hoping for Thriller... ideally in time for Halloween!
28-10-2017T14:03:19,Dadrobit,#Thriller
28-10-2017T14:03:29,Kinipshun,i think pet daughter is my new favorite side story
28-10-2017T14:03:51,Kinipshun,thriller is cute too tho
28-10-2017T14:03:54,Combak,"When it was first suggested, I know I said it had enough potential to be a side comic."
28-10-2017T14:04:00,Combak,And timely Kini!
28-10-2017T14:04:30,Kinipshun,i love pet daughter lol
28-10-2017T14:04:47,TorqueEmUp,same
28-10-2017T14:07:04,BluePhantom90,I thought the dog was a boy. but you said daughter so -shrugs-
28-10-2017T14:07:17,Kinipshun,but
28-10-2017T14:07:24,Kinipshun,"""pet daughter"" lol"
28-10-2017T14:07:46,TorqueEmUp,lol
28-10-2017T14:08:15,Combak,It has always been a girl.
28-10-2017T14:08:43,Kinipshun,"i left this comment on patreon, but do we know her name?"
28-10-2017T14:11:17,Combak,Nope
28-10-2017T14:12:07,BluePhantom90,well you helped with the idea. You and tom can think of a name.
28-10-2017T14:12:43,Kinipshun,it would have to be a name that works both as a pet's name AND a person's name
28-10-2017T14:12:50,BluePhantom90,Oh I got some sketch idea's for people who want to do a joke one. Ask from a list of characters and I may have a idea if you want one from my list
28-10-2017T14:12:55,TorqueEmUp,Daisy?
28-10-2017T14:12:56,TorqueEmUp,:P
28-10-2017T14:13:05,Kinipshun,daisy could work
28-10-2017T14:13:11,BluePhantom90,yeah
28-10-2017T14:13:23,Kinipshun,but thhat kinda sounds more like a mrs robinson name to me
28-10-2017T14:13:24,Kinipshun,lol
28-10-2017T14:14:09,TorqueEmUp,Don't know what that is. lol
28-10-2017T14:14:18,Kinipshun,maybe bella
28-10-2017T14:14:26,Kinipshun,i like that name
28-10-2017T14:14:37,TorqueEmUp,I actually got the name from HousePets.
28-10-2017T14:14:54,Combak,Bella ella ella hey hey:musical_note::notes:
28-10-2017T14:14:57,Kinipshun,"although she doesn't seem like a ""bella"""

28-10-2017T14:17:32,BluePhantom90,hmm Lucy seems better. but -shrugs-
28-10-2017T14:17:38,Kinipshun,she seems like a Lily
28-10-2017T14:17:55,TorqueEmUp,"Lucy makes me think of that old TV show ""I love Lucy"" :P"
28-10-2017T14:18:01,BluePhantom90,SO anyone want some sketch idea's on my list! I have like over a 100... with some crossed out
28-10-2017T14:18:15,Combak,Let's hear a few.
28-10-2017T14:18:31,Kinipshun,"troll// if it doesn't involve pet daughter, im not interested"
28-10-2017T14:18:42,TorqueEmUp,Flower names seem like a good bet for Pet Daughter
28-10-2017T14:18:53,Kinipshun,eeeeeeehhhhh
28-10-2017T14:18:58,Combak,Speaking of... https://www.patreon.com/posts/pet-daughter-3-15104695
28-10-2017T14:18:59,TorqueEmUp,"I would say Rose, if TwoKinds didn't already have a Rose. lol"
28-10-2017T14:19:37,Kinipshun,he posted that a WHILE ago lol
28-10-2017T14:20:31,Combak,"If you count 2 hours as ""a while ago"" sure..."
28-10-2017T14:20:55,Kinipshun,"if your food was ready two hours ago, you'd say a while"
28-10-2017T14:20:56,TorqueEmUp,He's probably thinking the one he posted with the Color Vote.
28-10-2017T14:20:58,qwe304,my Halloween costume: https://imgur.com/a/eSbbO
28-10-2017T14:21:00,Combak,"Also, did any of the pet daughter sketches get colored?"
28-10-2017T14:21:06,Kinipshun,hey qwe
28-10-2017T14:21:12,TorqueEmUp,"Or She, since I don't actually know. lol"

28-10-2017T14:21:29,qwe304,i wont be here for the stream though
28-10-2017T14:21:35,TorqueEmUp,Bummer
28-10-2017T14:21:38,Combak,Neat Qwe. Might want to rotate the picture though.
28-10-2017T14:21:52,qwe304,o lol xd
28-10-2017T14:21:59,qwe304,i didnt check it first
28-10-2017T14:22:57,TorqueEmUp,Hmm Petunia sounds like a old lady name. Maybe because it reminds me of that old lady from Futurama.
28-10-2017T14:23:05,Kinipshun,now you need some chick in a tiger costume lol
28-10-2017T14:23:09,TorqueEmUp,Just thinking of different flower names
28-10-2017T14:23:34,qwe304,if i could find someone willing to do that id probably already be married to them
28-10-2017T14:23:48,Kinipshun,^
28-10-2017T14:23:53,BluePhantom90,Rosette isn't a old name. Its from a character I liked in a anime
28-10-2017T14:24:07,Kinipshun,"qwe just look for a ""FURRY"""
28-10-2017T14:24:25,qwe304,"they are rare, and hard to detect"
28-10-2017T14:24:30,Kinipshun,very true
28-10-2017T14:24:37,Kinipshun,especially the female ones
28-10-2017T14:24:42,qwe304,its like finding a shiny pokemon
28-10-2017T14:25:11,Kinipshun,or you could roll the dice and get a girlfriend to turn INTO a furry
28-10-2017T14:25:20,qwe304,not easy...
28-10-2017T14:25:27,Kinipshun,also very true
28-10-2017T14:26:52,TorqueEmUp,"True, Blue but it is still close to Rose, and some stupid people might try and assume that it's Rose's abandoned daughter or something."
28-10-2017T14:27:19,Kinipshun,nah i dont want to beleive that
28-10-2017T14:27:20,qwe304,wait wut :|
28-10-2017T14:27:23,BluePhantom90,lol well floppy ears mean they are a dog

28-10-2017T14:27:53,Kinipshun,its usually bgr that fucks up my carrots
28-10-2017T14:27:56,BluePhantom90,plus they are in modern times
28-10-2017T14:28:18,TorqueEmUp,"Still the TwoKinds universe, I think anyway"
28-10-2017T14:28:28,TorqueEmUp,but yeah
28-10-2017T14:28:30,TorqueEmUp,I dunno
28-10-2017T14:28:53,Kinipshun,"i dont think rose ever mated tho, did she?"
28-10-2017T14:29:03,TorqueEmUp,We don't know that
28-10-2017T14:29:04,qwe304,we dont know
28-10-2017T14:29:09,TorqueEmUp,I am sure she has
28-10-2017T14:29:11,Kinipshun,"she seems kinda like a ""lone wolf"""
28-10-2017T14:29:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Ello o/
28-10-2017T14:29:15,qwe304,no evidence of such
28-10-2017T14:29:25,Kinipshun,hey marv
28-10-2017T14:29:30,TorqueEmUp,No evidence doesn't mean that it didn't happen.
28-10-2017T14:29:36,BluePhantom90,Well she would go into heat at times. So we wont know who her mate was
28-10-2017T14:29:37,Kinipshun,also true
28-10-2017T14:29:44,Bgrmystr2,grumblemumble :ptv-sleepy:
28-10-2017T14:30:07,Kinipshun,"speaking of fucking up my carrots, hey bgr!"
28-10-2017T14:30:15,TorqueEmUp,Plus Keidran mate to get to know one another.
28-10-2017T14:30:26,TorqueEmUp,typically
28-10-2017T14:30:35,Bgrmystr2,fuh?
28-10-2017T14:30:39,TorqueEmUp,ones that haven't lived around humans all their lives.
28-10-2017T14:30:40,Kinipshun,"again, i raise my ""lone wolf"" point"
28-10-2017T14:31:15,Kinipshun,were there any males in the legacy estate other than trace?
28-10-2017T14:31:24,Kinipshun,human OR keidran?
28-10-2017T14:31:38,Kinipshun,(or basitin (i dont discriminate))
28-10-2017T14:31:43,qwe304,other slaves prob.

28-10-2017T14:32:07,TorqueEmUp,"We don't know enough about Rose. We know she is a cousin to Euchre, and watches over the Legacy Estate, but we haven't seen enough of her to judge her personality as a ""lone wolf"""
28-10-2017T14:32:26,qwe304,well il be missing it
28-10-2017T14:32:31,BluePhantom90,she could be les
28-10-2017T14:32:39,TorqueEmUp,Yup
28-10-2017T14:33:30,BluePhantom90,Okay anyone want a Western Basitin joke sketch idea I came up with
28-10-2017T14:33:56,BluePhantom90,and those that already heard it don't spoil it
28-10-2017T14:34:09,Kinipshun,sure
28-10-2017T14:34:19,Kinipshun,i wanna hear a joke
28-10-2017T14:34:42,qwe304,my social life is a joke
28-10-2017T14:35:10,TorqueEmUp,"Also I just noticed that Tom have given ""Pet Daughter"" its own tag on Patreon."
28-10-2017T14:35:12,WereKeidran,pops out of the ground

28-10-2017T14:36:09,Kinipshun,like if lily will be pet daughter's official name
28-10-2017T14:36:17,Kinipshun,*Lily
28-10-2017T14:36:26,Bgrmystr2,lily already exists though
28-10-2017T14:36:31,Bgrmystr2,as a nickname
28-10-2017T14:36:33,Kinipshun,*lillith
28-10-2017T14:36:38,Kinipshun,thats diff
28-10-2017T14:36:43,Bgrmystr2,no it's not
28-10-2017T14:36:51,Bgrmystr2,lily is short for lillith
28-10-2017T14:36:53,WereKeidran,"Lilith is a wolf, the pet daughter is a dog"
28-10-2017T14:37:10,Dadrobit,Pet Daughter should be named Fido
28-10-2017T14:37:12,Bgrmystr2,or lillian
28-10-2017T14:37:36,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Pet daughter should be named Florbo
28-10-2017T14:37:39,Kinipshun,"okay so apparently my ""Lily"" idea is no good and now i have to come up with a diff one"
28-10-2017T14:37:49,BadFoMo,Hi (sorry for the late reply). So Tom didn't give out any lore?
28-10-2017T14:37:57,Kinipshun,no
28-10-2017T14:38:01,BadFoMo,Cool.
28-10-2017T14:38:06,Dadrobit,"Hey FoMo, happy B-day"
28-10-2017T14:38:13,WereKeidran,"I'm channeling my inner Trace right now, ie listing all the female names already being used in the comic"
28-10-2017T14:38:14,Kinipshun,yeah it's still kindof a blank canvas
28-10-2017T14:38:17,BadFoMo,Thanks!
28-10-2017T14:38:18,qwe304,i hope someone is writing all the stuff tom says down
28-10-2017T14:38:26,Kinipshun,^
28-10-2017T14:38:30,Bgrmystr2,"I like lily, but that was the original name people gave to Lillith"

28-10-2017T14:38:45,qwe304,even if he ends up contradicting it himself
28-10-2017T14:39:13,Bgrmystr2,"lol que, you mean like everything / nothing is canon?"
28-10-2017T14:39:16,BadFoMo,@qwe304 I really need to stop procrastanating and do that.
28-10-2017T14:39:18,Kinipshun,i'd be fine if tom shoots my idea down. im just giving ideas
28-10-2017T14:39:28,BadFoMo,@NeonMitsumi Thanks.

28-10-2017T14:41:56,TorqueEmUp,How about Sophia for Pet Daughter?
28-10-2017T14:42:17,MarvTheHugPharaoh,but we did get #thriller

28-10-2017T15:26:16,BadFoMo,@TanConan Atleast the first three.
28-10-2017T15:26:20,Combak,"First three will be, other 2 might depending on time."
28-10-2017T15:26:29,TanConan,Ah ok thanks
28-10-2017T15:26:34,Dadrobit,The last ones will get colored eventually if he does stop today

28-10-2017T15:33:40,FenceEqualizer,I'm aware of the importance. I still will shake my fist at it
28-10-2017T15:33:41,TorqueEmUp,"but nah, the U.S doesn't deal with DST crap until the 5th of Nov."
28-10-2017T15:33:49,ThingsAreMoving,well daylight saving time it not necessary anymore
28-10-2017T15:33:58,Bgrmystr2,"technically, no Torque. it's on right now."
28-10-2017T15:34:00,ThingsAreMoving,y'know with all the electric lights we can use
28-10-2017T15:34:12,Dadrobit,Legit. AZ gave it up because it made people pissed.
28-10-2017T15:34:13,Ordithus,"I like my noon to be at noon, dagnabbit!"
28-10-2017T15:34:14,Dimensional,DST ends on the 5th.
28-10-2017T15:34:16,Bgrmystr2,and it goes back to normal time that everyone else is on for November 5th
28-10-2017T15:34:20,unsteddyphoenix,Has anyonee else noticed that adelaide is somwhat big and tall?
28-10-2017T15:34:26,Bgrmystr2,"Everyone has, Phonenix."
28-10-2017T15:34:27,Dimensional,There's a push in other states to get rid of DST because it's useless now
28-10-2017T15:34:28,ThingsAreMoving,she B I G !
28-10-2017T15:34:36,unsteddyphoenix,noticed just now
28-10-2017T15:34:37,Ordithus,What gets weird in AZ is some of the reservations DO observe DST.
28-10-2017T15:34:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hail to the King
28-10-2017T15:34:46,Dadrobit,"We already get enough sun, so changing our clocks to sort of get more made people depressed."
28-10-2017T15:34:49,ChromeDragon24,hail
28-10-2017T15:34:52,ThingsAreMoving,makes you wonder how tall will Maddie be when she's all grown up
28-10-2017T15:34:55,TorqueEmUp,"Honestly DST is never on or off to me, it's just fall back 1 hour in the Fall, and go forward an hour in the spring. :P"
28-10-2017T15:35:12,Dadrobit,"Yeah, Reservations do their own thing, for better or worse."
28-10-2017T15:35:27,ZizzoGaming,Hail Hydra
28-10-2017T15:35:32,Bgrmystr2,it's one day out of the year
28-10-2017T15:35:37,Ordithus,"There is one resevation that is inside of another.  The big one observes DST, the little one does not."
28-10-2017T15:35:40,MarvTheHugPharaoh,get out of here Captain America
28-10-2017T15:35:43,Ordithus,That was confusing
28-10-2017T15:35:44,TorqueEmUp,"Yeah, because the jump forward makes people late for work, or lose an hour of sleep."
28-10-2017T15:35:54,FenceEqualizer,Tell that to my bodies internal clock
28-10-2017T15:36:05,TorqueEmUp,"Fall back just makes people either early for work, or get to sleep in an hour later."
28-10-2017T15:36:11,FenceEqualizer,My body does not play by the rules.
28-10-2017T15:36:13,Bgrmystr2,the accumulative hour saved every single day while DST is up is huge.
28-10-2017T15:36:16,ThingsAreMoving,should be at least
28-10-2017T15:36:25,Bgrmystr2,Peole work on Saturday too lol

28-10-2017T15:36:39,FenceEqualizer,And me!
28-10-2017T15:36:40,unsteddyphoenix,is it a more-sleep-in clock change or a less-sleep-in clockchange?
28-10-2017T15:36:47,MarvTheHugPharaoh,damn these keys near my enter key
28-10-2017T15:36:52,ThingsAreMoving,goto bed one hour early lol
28-10-2017T15:36:58,Bgrmystr2,"when you move forward an hour, you sleep in less"
28-10-2017T15:37:01,Combak,"Fall back, spring forward."
28-10-2017T15:37:06,Bgrmystr2,"cuz instead of 6 in the morning, it's 7"
28-10-2017T15:37:09,CrRAR,yeah the sucky kinda time change
28-10-2017T15:37:10,TorqueEmUp,"My days off are Wednesdays and Thursdays, so the whole DST changes on weekends doesn't do a damn thing to help me. lol"

28-10-2017T15:37:32,ThingsAreMoving,I used to work 12h shifts all week so I know how to control my sleep cycle well
28-10-2017T15:37:35,FoxxTrotter,I noticed a news article that Massachusetts and Maine want to move over to Atlantic Standard Time and do away with DST completely.
28-10-2017T15:37:49,FoxxTrotter,Plenty of changeovers.
28-10-2017T15:37:50,Bgrmystr2,"Extra hour of day, Torque. Your days off aren't really relevant xD"
28-10-2017T15:38:10,Ordithus,Laura cute.

28-10-2017T15:57:28,TheGamakazi,So... Has she actually SPOKEN to him yet? or is she sliently following him around :ptv-uneasy:
28-10-2017T15:57:30,Menke,Does Tom mirror all pics when he colors then or just the ones I suggest? XD
28-10-2017T15:57:45,Bgrmystr2,Generally all images
28-10-2017T15:57:52,Combak,"All of them, probably. It helps with seeing stuff."
28-10-2017T15:57:53,Bgrmystr2,it's a common thing for artists to do
28-10-2017T15:58:02,Menke,Interesting.  I guess I haven't noticed in the past
28-10-2017T15:58:05,ILoveRainee,Is anyone here a NoraCard user?
28-10-2017T15:58:11,Dadrobit,Things get mirrored to more easily allow drawing lines that flow with the artist's movements at times
28-10-2017T15:58:13,FenceEqualizer,I don't think Therie Sah-van speaks human
28-10-2017T15:58:20,ThingsAreMoving,they flip often?
28-10-2017T15:58:35,TheGamakazi,unless it's straight on
28-10-2017T15:58:37,Ordithus,Some artists more than others
28-10-2017T15:58:39,Bgrmystr2,"it's not that, though dadro, it's for looking for misplaced and improper lines"
28-10-2017T15:58:48,Dadrobit,And flipping can often show imperfections that were not obvious before
28-10-2017T15:59:10,Bgrmystr2,"tis what it's for, yes :P"
28-10-2017T15:59:18,Menke,"I imagine it's kind of like how when you're revising something you've written, it often helps to put it in a different size/font so it's not as 'familiar' and you don't skim over imperfections, like you said."
28-10-2017T15:59:20,ZizzoGaming,Well the video died on my end
28-10-2017T15:59:27,ThingsAreMoving,"sooo, it's for a different perspective, so to speak"
28-10-2017T15:59:39,ThingsAreMoving,video is well on this end
28-10-2017T15:59:46,Combak,"... Interesting Menke, I should remember that tip."
28-10-2017T15:59:52,LeKnightWolf,does any think these two would be able to have a successful side comic/mini comic if Tom decided to work on one?
28-10-2017T16:00:03,Combak,Eh...
28-10-2017T16:00:10,ThingsAreMoving,depends on the plot tbh
28-10-2017T16:00:11,ChromeDragon24,maybe
28-10-2017T16:00:15,Menke,I think there are like 3 side comics that would be successful out of sketches he's done
28-10-2017T16:00:18,unsteddyphoenix,tom could basically have a successful side comic with most iddeas
28-10-2017T16:00:19,Dadrobit,"It'd be a short one, but probably."
28-10-2017T16:00:24,ZizzoGaming,It plays for like half a second before freezing
28-10-2017T16:00:26,unsteddyphoenix,Should be aiming higher lol
28-10-2017T16:00:36,Menke,"This one, the dog-daughter, that one with the really tall dog-man, etc."
28-10-2017T16:00:41,ThingsAreMoving,to the stars!
28-10-2017T16:00:51,LeKnightWolf,dog man or dog daughter?
28-10-2017T16:01:03,LeKnightWolf,your confusing me here.
28-10-2017T16:01:04,Combak,Dog daughter.
28-10-2017T16:01:08,Ordithus,They both are things.
28-10-2017T16:01:09,CrRAR,dog girl supreme
28-10-2017T16:01:10,unsteddyphoenix,"the real challeng is to think up an idea that WOULDNT suceed, even with Toms art."
28-10-2017T16:01:24,Combak,Colin IS a side project. XD
28-10-2017T16:01:35,Dadrobit,I could do that
28-10-2017T16:01:39,LeKnightWolf,what are you trying to say unsteddy
28-10-2017T16:01:44,TorqueEmUp,Probably will be a while though.
28-10-2017T16:01:48,Menke,"If the artist is good enough, they can make anything work.  Like when someone dared Jim Butcher to make a fantasy series based on the Lost Roman Legion and Pokemon and he made Codex Alera and it was awesome."
28-10-2017T16:01:56,Dimensional,The comic that was the original idea for TwoKinds
28-10-2017T16:02:00,Bgrmystr2,We've been trying to figure that out for years @LeKnightWolf
28-10-2017T16:02:09,TorqueEmUp,Halfkinds?
28-10-2017T16:02:11,Dadrobit,Probably not Dime
28-10-2017T16:02:17,ThingsAreMoving,lol bgr
28-10-2017T16:02:20,Combak,It's out there @dimensional
28-10-2017T16:02:21,Bgrmystr2,:v
28-10-2017T16:02:27,unsteddyphoenix,bgr is the greatest at understanding things
28-10-2017T16:02:37,Combak,https://www.2kinds.com/halfkind/?p=1
28-10-2017T16:02:39,ThingsAreMoving,"that's true, he understands me"
28-10-2017T16:02:43,unsteddyphoenix,look to him for guidance
28-10-2017T16:03:01,MarvTheHugPharaoh,id rather not
28-10-2017T16:03:07,LeKnightWolf,well if all depends on how much effort he will place on such comic.
28-10-2017T16:03:27,Bgrmystr2,"also, I agree with your sentiments phoenix. It would be difficult to find something that would not succeed with Tom drawing it."
28-10-2017T16:03:37,FenceEqualizer,A comic about the stream chat.
28-10-2017T16:03:38,ThingsAreMoving,Stickman comics
28-10-2017T16:03:39,TorqueEmUp,I mean he'd probably have to slow down on the comic if he were to do a side project.
28-10-2017T16:03:41,LeKnightWolf,not that he doesn't put any at all but its...
28-10-2017T16:03:50,ThingsAreMoving,lol fence
28-10-2017T16:04:08,ThingsAreMoving,that would require a whole army of artists
28-10-2017T16:04:14,LeKnightWolf,XD
28-10-2017T16:04:20,Bgrmystr2,nuh uh
28-10-2017T16:04:24,Bgrmystr2,just ONE artist.
28-10-2017T16:04:26,Xexanoth,nah it would just be random scribbles to represent the chaos of chat
28-10-2017T16:04:42,MarvTheHugPharaoh,an army of one artist
28-10-2017T16:04:47,Bgrmystr2,I can already think of an artist who draws what goes on in chat.
28-10-2017T16:04:54,FenceEqualizer,Don't think it would make a good side comic
28-10-2017T16:04:57,ThingsAreMoving,"Well some people were able to make comic out of Jaden's tweets. so yeah, it is doable imho"
28-10-2017T16:05:07,TorqueEmUp,Me too Bgr
28-10-2017T16:05:08,FenceEqualizer,Well I stand corrected then.
28-10-2017T16:05:11,Ordithus,The loop around the tail is a neat detail.  The mechanics of pants and anthro characters.
28-10-2017T16:05:14,djikoz,the room chat will be represented destroyed
28-10-2017T16:05:15,CrRAR,Where's Kei to pester Daniels about his slacking?
28-10-2017T16:05:27,CrRAR,He should be out there slaying more of the unreighteous!
28-10-2017T16:05:34,ThingsAreMoving,Kei is busy spying on flora
28-10-2017T16:05:42,CrRAR,Ahh
28-10-2017T16:05:43,Combak,"""Unreighteous"""
28-10-2017T16:05:47,Dimensional,Too bad the sketch of Fem Wolf Red didn't win. XP
28-10-2017T16:05:48,CrRAR,That explains it
28-10-2017T16:05:52,LeKnightWolf,it just matters how skilled you are and how fast you can think.
28-10-2017T16:05:55,CrRAR,*unrighteous
28-10-2017T16:05:57,CrRAR,there
28-10-2017T16:05:58,CrRAR,fixed
28-10-2017T16:06:01,Dimensional,Slay those dirty but cute wolves?
28-10-2017T16:06:02,TorqueEmUp,Wait a minute I am a wolf!
28-10-2017T16:06:07,CrRAR,you...are!?

28-10-2017T16:06:15,CrRAR,"wuff, wuff"

28-10-2017T16:06:27,Bgrmystr2,"I don't think you are Torque, I think you are a car engine."
28-10-2017T16:06:34,FenceEqualizer,Oh god this music is putting me to sleep.
28-10-2017T16:06:35,Bgrmystr2,But you know
28-10-2017T16:06:48,MarvTheHugPharaoh,he seems to be a 4a-ge
28-10-2017T16:06:49,Ordithus,"bgr, by that logic I'm a log."
28-10-2017T16:06:55,CrRAR,awwww
28-10-2017T16:06:58,Bgrmystr2,"Yes, Ord. Yes you are."
28-10-2017T16:06:59,unsteddyphoenix,LOGic
28-10-2017T16:07:00,FenceEqualizer,"It's like, soothing."

28-10-2017T16:07:12,LeKnightWolf,indeed it is fence
28-10-2017T16:07:14,ThingsAreMoving,and we are in motion
28-10-2017T16:07:15,ProsePro7,Tom don't forget the bells on the base of her tail
28-10-2017T16:07:25,unsteddyphoenix,<2 because too young for <3
28-10-2017T16:07:32,CrRAR,tru
28-10-2017T16:07:34,TorqueEmUp,"and hell I couldn't even tell what BGR would be, looks like a TV screen with something random playing on it."
28-10-2017T16:07:42,Bgrmystr2,haha
28-10-2017T16:07:46,Ordithus,I think CrRar is a box
28-10-2017T16:07:47,ThingsAreMoving,BGR would be a nice wallpaper
28-10-2017T16:07:51,CrRAR,"I didn't know it, but it was right at the time"
28-10-2017T16:07:53,BadFoMo,I'm back.
28-10-2017T16:07:55,Bgrmystr2,"I would be a nice wallpaper, Things."
28-10-2017T16:07:58,MarvTheHugPharaoh,wb FoMo
28-10-2017T16:08:08,FenceEqualizer,Welcome back.
28-10-2017T16:08:09,ThingsAreMoving,o/ FoMo
28-10-2017T16:08:12,djikoz,wb
28-10-2017T16:09:00,ZizzoGaming,Bgr looks like a tablet with a Fluff-Kevlar drawing on it
28-10-2017T16:09:01,TorqueEmUp,Therie's cousin is such a bitch.
28-10-2017T16:09:18,BadFoMo,I was aiding my 'friend' and his mother pack candy into snack baggys for Halloween.
28-10-2017T16:09:21,Xexanoth,pretty sure BGR is ara
28-10-2017T16:09:22,Kamaro12,so how's everyone's sundays going
28-10-2017T16:09:31,Xexanoth,the profile pic i mean
28-10-2017T16:09:32,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Kam
28-10-2017T16:09:33,Combak,"Fine, how about you Kam?"
28-10-2017T16:09:35,TorqueEmUp,"Decent, your's Kam?"
28-10-2017T16:09:39,Kamaro12,lazy :P
28-10-2017T16:09:40,Bgrmystr2,"It's a framed wallpaper, Zizzo"
28-10-2017T16:09:41,Sammit,Hi Kamaro
28-10-2017T16:09:44,TanConan,What does „wb“ mean?
28-10-2017T16:09:49,Dadrobit,"Okay, so hear me out. Ronald Regan suddenly appears in Mekkan, confused about the world which so easily gave up its currency for Templar coins, he attempts to implement Regan-omics into society with the help of Vehra who he accidentally saved. The Title?"
28-10-2017T16:09:51,BadFoMo,I'm fine too. You?
28-10-2017T16:09:53,Kamaro12,tan: welcome back
28-10-2017T16:09:54,ThingsAreMoving,wb = welcome back
28-10-2017T16:09:58,Combak,WB=Welcome Back
28-10-2017T16:09:59,Dadrobit,It's morning in mekkan again
28-10-2017T16:10:01,ZizzoGaming,Wb= welcome back
28-10-2017T16:10:05,TanConan,oh thx
28-10-2017T16:10:08,unsteddyphoenix,sold.
28-10-2017T16:10:11,MarvTheHugPharaoh,^
28-10-2017T16:10:12,CrRAR,lol
28-10-2017T16:10:14,unsteddyphoenix,not bad enough
28-10-2017T16:10:24,TanConan,that was quite obvious
28-10-2017T16:10:31,CrRAR,Dead Precedence?
28-10-2017T16:10:32,ThingsAreMoving,"brb, gonna grab me some hot cocoa with brandy"
28-10-2017T16:10:36,Menke,"I've actually imagined a scene in my head of the two mean tigers telling their people that the humans can't be trusted, and Therie coming in to lay the verbal smackdown"
28-10-2017T16:10:37,ThingsAreMoving,best for cold nights
28-10-2017T16:10:52,FenceEqualizer,I think it hits so bad it's good territory.
28-10-2017T16:10:55,Dadrobit,How would you improve it?
28-10-2017T16:11:13,djikoz,"about Therie Sah-Van, i know her name comes from 37, but why 37 ?"
28-10-2017T16:11:16,CrRAR,There's nothing that cannot be improved by pizza.
28-10-2017T16:11:17,FenceEqualizer,Like you want to see the train wreck
28-10-2017T16:11:24,Vexd,This has got to be about more than just a bet now
28-10-2017T16:11:28,Bgrmystr2,xD Cr
28-10-2017T16:11:32,Combak,Random number picked by people on the TK forums.
28-10-2017T16:11:33,Menke,"Or, you know, Therie actually talking in the comic. XD  Which I think at this point would about as dramatic as someone saying Red's name"
28-10-2017T16:11:34,Xexanoth,That was just a random number she got assigne
28-10-2017T16:11:50,unsteddyphoenix,Uh
28-10-2017T16:11:51,djikoz,oh ok XD
28-10-2017T16:11:57,Xexanoth,"she was ""Tigress #37"""
28-10-2017T16:12:00,Xexanoth,as a joke
28-10-2017T16:12:02,unsteddyphoenix,I mean I doubt she'll ever be in the comic again?
28-10-2017T16:12:08,FenceEqualizer,^
28-10-2017T16:12:19,FenceEqualizer,She will live through the stream.
28-10-2017T16:12:27,Dadrobit,Ronald Reagan attempts to implement Reagan-omics through the acquisition of all local pizzarias which he holds hostage against the might of the Templar opposing his ideologies.
28-10-2017T16:12:28,TorqueEmUp,Like Laura
28-10-2017T16:12:29,unsteddyphoenix,yeah
28-10-2017T16:12:35,CrRAR,"The feathers the tigers wear, are they off a favorite game foul/food source?"
28-10-2017T16:12:37,TorqueEmUp,except less dead
28-10-2017T16:12:41,unsteddyphoenix,people get weirdly hung up on these minor characters lol
28-10-2017T16:12:48,Bgrmystr2,"uh.. yeah that could be written as a comedy, Dadro"
28-10-2017T16:12:53,Bgrmystr2,and people would still want to read it
28-10-2017T16:13:02,FenceEqualizer,A little but I think that's the charm of Tom stream
28-10-2017T16:13:09,CrRAR,How could we not love Therie Sehvan!?
28-10-2017T16:13:10,Dadrobit,Written as a dark gritty noir
28-10-2017T16:13:11,Menke,It's natural for people to want more depth to the minor characters that don't get as much comic screen-time.  Because the main characters get plenty of attention.
28-10-2017T16:13:17,TorqueEmUp,^
28-10-2017T16:13:18,FenceEqualizer,You get to see how the minor characters react to certain situations.
28-10-2017T16:13:28,Xexanoth,"also she's cute, so"
28-10-2017T16:13:31,Combak,"Eh, we'll probably see 37 again when it comes to the Tiger-Templar meeting... Or next time the story turns towards the town of Edenmire."
28-10-2017T16:13:32,Bgrmystr2,"aaaaand it would still have comedy, Dadro XD"
28-10-2017T16:13:38,unsteddyphoenix,I think Xex has it closer
28-10-2017T16:13:44,TorqueEmUp,"Well tell me a tigress that ""isn't"" cute. lol"
28-10-2017T16:13:45,BluePhantom90,wont deny she is cute
28-10-2017T16:13:51,FenceEqualizer,Also Robit. I'm sold. Give me the first entry to the comic
28-10-2017T16:13:52,CrRAR,...wait
28-10-2017T16:13:56,BadFoMo,@Vexd I like to think that she's useing the bet as an excuse to try dating outside her speches due to no one in her tribe being right for her.
28-10-2017T16:14:08,CrRAR,^
28-10-2017T16:14:10,Dadrobit,#QualityShitPosting
28-10-2017T16:14:13,CrRAR,sound reasonable
28-10-2017T16:14:20,unsteddyphoenix,Main characters get screentime...because...theyre the main characters.
28-10-2017T16:14:21,Vexd,That's a way to look at it
28-10-2017T16:14:42,TorqueEmUp,"Well those two that hurt Flora's feelings weren't cute, they were just being cunts."
28-10-2017T16:14:55,MarvTheHugPharaoh,they were prety ot
28-10-2017T16:14:57,MarvTheHugPharaoh,hot even
28-10-2017T16:15:03,BluePhantom90,Most Tigresses haven't seen a lot of humans in one place or at all. So they want to see what they look like under the clothing
28-10-2017T16:15:05,Menke,"I just realized that all the suggestions I've managed to get drawn by Tom are of side characters. XD  Except for one with Mike/Raine, since Raine is more main now"
28-10-2017T16:15:14,TorqueEmUp,Hot =/= Cute
28-10-2017T16:15:21,Bgrmystr2,Visual looks are not representitive of personality.
28-10-2017T16:15:27,Bgrmystr2,Never will be.
28-10-2017T16:15:29,unsteddyphoenix,its a spectrum
28-10-2017T16:15:34,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
28-10-2017T16:15:39,TorqueEmUp,No but personalities could be found cute
28-10-2017T16:15:40,unsteddyphoenix,"well, not so true bgr"
28-10-2017T16:15:44,CrRAR,a...continuum of sorts.
28-10-2017T16:15:49,CrRAR,all verrry complicated
28-10-2017T16:15:50,Menke,"But every character has their own life which is just as interesting to them as any main character's life.  And while the comic explores the main characters, the stream helps people to see exploration of the side characters."
28-10-2017T16:16:01,Menke,BadFoMo - The Mike/Raine sitting at a bar
28-10-2017T16:16:02,unsteddyphoenix,A characters personality should be able to displayed visualy in some cases
28-10-2017T16:16:16,Bgrmystr2,Coincidence and convenience does not a confirmation make lol
28-10-2017T16:16:17,Zebranky,The way you present and carry yourself certainly does have some connection to your personality
28-10-2017T16:16:20,BadFoMo,@Menke Oh that one. Thanks.
28-10-2017T16:16:26,CrRAR,"When you can FEEL the crazy, you should probably run."
28-10-2017T16:16:29,unsteddyphoenix,E.g. look at Rose
28-10-2017T16:16:40,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-keith8D:
28-10-2017T16:16:46,FenceEqualizer,Young Rose or sassy old Rose?
28-10-2017T16:16:52,unsteddyphoenix,Old
28-10-2017T16:16:56,MarvTheHugPharaoh,sassy
28-10-2017T16:17:03,MuonNeutrino,"though it can be that a side character gets more main comic time *because* they're liked in side situations like this, e.g. rose >.>"
28-10-2017T16:17:06,TorqueEmUp,"Honestly I feel Old Rose, and Young Rose feel like two completely different characters."
28-10-2017T16:17:15,MuonNeutrino,i doubt tom would have brought her back if she hadn't been such a hit with the fans

28-10-2017T16:18:22,TorqueEmUp,Damn does Therie have dem hips
28-10-2017T16:18:36,MuonNeutrino,"i disagree about the not much attention thing, but i may be biased >.>"
28-10-2017T16:18:39,Combak,"IDK... Then again, it made sense to use her in Dragon Masquerade to show that she turned out fine, and then reusing her as Trace's manor manager just adds a nice bit of drama under the surface."
28-10-2017T16:18:40,Bgrmystr2,"As do most tigers, from the looks of it, Torque"
28-10-2017T16:18:42,CrRAR,Them hip made for pouncin'
28-10-2017T16:18:45,TheGamakazi,Battling fires in heavy armour and what looks to be a very flamable cape does not seem like the best course of action :ptv-confused:
28-10-2017T16:18:54,Twokinds,brb! Heard a crash
28-10-2017T16:18:55,MuonNeutrino,i will say that she grabbed pretty much everyone's hearts in her brief appearance in that flashback

28-10-2017T16:19:04,Bgrmystr2,"that's not good, tom"
28-10-2017T16:19:05,ThingsAreMoving,shoot the burglars!
28-10-2017T16:19:07,MuonNeutrino,certainly relative to how little screen time she had

28-10-2017T16:26:27,PalmettoPathfinder1,Why no female eric?
28-10-2017T16:26:37,PalmettoPathfinder1,I thought she was canon....to an extent
28-10-2017T16:26:45,TorqueEmUp,"We've had female eric before, at least as a Keidran."

28-10-2017T16:27:19,FenceEqualizer,Wasn't someone trying to put up a butt line up before?
28-10-2017T16:27:22,Edinku,Now a male lineup?
28-10-2017T16:27:23,ThingsAreMoving,2 many in quick succession
28-10-2017T16:27:24,Dadrobit,They're boring and uncreative?
28-10-2017T16:27:28,TorqueEmUp,^
28-10-2017T16:27:30,Serpentfrog,Line ups don't really do anything new.
28-10-2017T16:27:32,BadFoMo,@Dadrobit I think I can get behind that.
28-10-2017T16:27:35,Vexd,We've gone through 3 of em in the span of two months
28-10-2017T16:27:41,Menke,"I'm not a huge fan of line-ups myself, because I prefer for characters to be doing something instead of posing.  But that's me.  I hate posing for pictures too."

28-10-2017T16:27:51,FenceEqualizer,Wouldn't mind a break that's for certain.
28-10-2017T16:28:15,TheGamakazi,"Yeah, line ups are not that fun"
28-10-2017T16:28:20,ThingsAreMoving,we need more comedy sketches
28-10-2017T16:28:28,TheGamakazi,I like it when the sketchs do something
28-10-2017T16:28:31,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Well, I could do my other request idea: Mike beats Natani and Adelaide at strip poker and while basking in victory, he fails to see the murderous glares of Nat and Adelaide."
28-10-2017T16:28:47,Kamaro12,we've already had like three strip poker suggestions XD
28-10-2017T16:28:53,unsteddyphoenix,^

28-10-2017T16:29:02,TorqueEmUp,Awoooo!
28-10-2017T16:29:04,Kamaro12,how about something that's not as blatantly fanservice?
28-10-2017T16:29:08,Menke,"Ironically I came up with a humorous suggestion idea and was going to swap it out for this one, but I decided to see how well this one did. XD"

28-10-2017T16:29:44,FenceEqualizer,Probably going to be on that for a while lol
28-10-2017T16:29:47,Kamaro12,but stuff like lineups and strip poker are too obvious

28-10-2017T16:30:32,FenceEqualizer,Yeah surprise Strip poker became so popular.
28-10-2017T16:30:33,LeKnightWolf,What about King Adelaid trying to find Maddie
28-10-2017T16:30:34,Edinku,"How about ""Adelaide meeting her future partner for the first time""?"
28-10-2017T16:30:41,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Well, I guess I could have it where Adelaide is piloting a Basitin Zaku, or Nat piloting a Keidran styled Gundam."
28-10-2017T16:30:42,Vexd,Wonder if the tail bells are hiding down there somewhere
28-10-2017T16:30:44,Kamaro12,gama: exactly. We could easily be putting in a lot more lore-filling questions
28-10-2017T16:30:47,BadFoMo,"So, should I go back to 'Keidran [Database error] getting a tummy rum' or do somthing else?"
28-10-2017T16:30:51,ThingsAreMoving,tries to get his Kat idea through
28-10-2017T16:30:55,BadFoMo,*rub
28-10-2017T16:30:59,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Seriously, no one is going to comment on my gundam ideas?"
28-10-2017T16:31:01,drykeon,fanservice not limited to his own comic apparently
28-10-2017T16:31:06,ThingsAreMoving,tummy rum?
28-10-2017T16:31:13,ThingsAreMoving,sounds vile
28-10-2017T16:31:16,BluePhantom90,I got idea's guys. If you want to hear them. I got a list

28-10-2017T16:32:14,MarvTheHugPharaoh,see ya buss
28-10-2017T16:32:15,PalmettoPathfinder1,Bye Micro!
28-10-2017T16:32:17,Serpentfrog,Tummy rum > tummy rub
28-10-2017T16:32:18,Bgrmystr2,The chat has gotten pretty big a few times
28-10-2017T16:32:20,Bgrmystr2,nothing unusual
28-10-2017T16:32:21,ThingsAreMoving,o/ Buss
28-10-2017T16:32:28,BluePhantom90,"Oh how about this guys. Two portraits 1. With King Adelaid and husband. 2. King Adelaid well pregnant, with Husband in bed with Cast around his lower body."
28-10-2017T16:32:32,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah just make your requests as self-indulgent as possible

28-10-2017T16:32:45,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Hero
28-10-2017T16:32:48,ThingsAreMoving,o/
28-10-2017T16:32:52,TorqueEmUp,I don't think we've had a single tummy rub sketch of any kind. At least none that I can recall.
28-10-2017T16:32:54,djikoz,o/
28-10-2017T16:32:55,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Still, it would help if I knew how many TwoKinds fans are Gundam fans as well."
28-10-2017T16:32:56,drykeon,hello
28-10-2017T16:32:59,Sammit,Hi Hero

28-10-2017T16:33:07,drykeon,wait
28-10-2017T16:33:08,ThingsAreMoving,Tummy rubs are lewd
28-10-2017T16:33:09,Vexd,"Nope, no belly rubs to be seen"
28-10-2017T16:33:10,unsteddyphoenix,"Blue thats good, I wanna see Adelaides husbando"
28-10-2017T16:33:13,HeroKing7077,Hug me phararo!
28-10-2017T16:33:17,Vexd,This must be fixed
28-10-2017T16:33:21,PalmettoPathfinder1,Wait....Idea storm!
28-10-2017T16:33:23,TheGamakazi,"I have to say though, I'm not happy with the way Twokinds ended at page 1,000. TOTAL CLIFFHANGER!"
28-10-2017T16:33:24,ThingsAreMoving,don't you know there are... ROWS going down on them?
28-10-2017T16:33:27,TorqueEmUp,Agree'd Vex!
28-10-2017T16:33:36,PalmettoPathfinder1,TOM!  Do a side comic of how Adelaide and her husband.
28-10-2017T16:33:45,Ordithus,"Then human tummy rubs, things"
28-10-2017T16:33:47,BluePhantom90,lol
28-10-2017T16:33:50,ThingsAreMoving,Adelaide's husbando may be considered a spoiler
28-10-2017T16:33:51,Edinku,A sketch request.
28-10-2017T16:33:52,ThingsAreMoving,jus sayin
28-10-2017T16:33:57,TheGamakazi,"Also Well done on 1,000 pages Tom :ptv-hearts:"
28-10-2017T16:34:00,drykeon,I dont think a side comic is an order
28-10-2017T16:34:07,Edinku,Adelaide meeting Maddie's father or something like that.
28-10-2017T16:34:08,BluePhantom90,No because we never see Maddie's father
28-10-2017T16:34:10,PalmettoPathfinder1,I think he's a Western Basitin.
28-10-2017T16:34:13,BadFoMo,@Vexd @TorqueEmUp Even if it's a Male's belly?
28-10-2017T16:34:14,Edinku,Just a sketch
28-10-2017T16:34:23,HeroKing7077,Who here likes Flower Girl?
28-10-2017T16:34:25,TorqueEmUp,I personally like to see a Wolf or Dog Keidran kicking their leg while getting a tummy rub. :P
28-10-2017T16:34:29,Keilani5747,Stahp the degeneracy
28-10-2017T16:34:30,ThingsAreMoving,We never see Lyn'Knoll as well. there's a reason
28-10-2017T16:34:38,TorqueEmUp,you know because completely original
28-10-2017T16:34:41,ThingsAreMoving,"jus sayin, it's a hazard"
28-10-2017T16:34:42,TorqueEmUp,:P
28-10-2017T16:34:44,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Torque that give me a idea
28-10-2017T16:34:53,Vexd,@BadFoMo WHAT? You don't have a perfectly good pregnant character and NOT use the belly rub on them!
28-10-2017T16:34:57,Serpentfrog,You heard Keilani! Stream cancelled!
28-10-2017T16:35:02,ThingsAreMoving,wat

28-10-2017T16:35:13,ThingsAreMoving,dun cancel the stream
28-10-2017T16:35:14,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Hm........BTW, here's an idea, alternate timeline, Adelaide and Nat fall in love with one another and get married!  This confuses Maddie however, who doesn't know whether to call Nat Mom or Dad."
28-10-2017T16:35:15,ThingsAreMoving,i needs it
28-10-2017T16:35:26,Zakuru,did i already say i was back?

28-10-2017T16:35:47,HeroKing7077,Zak attack!
28-10-2017T16:35:56,BluePhantom90,I thought of the beginning of Madness. With that Portrait one. Having King Adelaid her self. the second portrait with her Pregnant with Maddie. But the Husband is bed ridden
28-10-2017T16:35:59,drykeon,Zakuru
28-10-2017T16:36:04,PalmettoPathfinder1,I said Natani and Adelaide fall in love.
28-10-2017T16:36:13,PalmettoPathfinder1,In an alternate universe
28-10-2017T16:36:16,ThingsAreMoving,Oh damn I just got an idea
28-10-2017T16:36:20,FenceEqualizer,Didn't know they had songs with lyrics on divinity
28-10-2017T16:36:25,FenceEqualizer,Music be the credits song.
28-10-2017T16:36:27,drykeon,go on
28-10-2017T16:36:32,TorqueEmUp,must be Fence
28-10-2017T16:36:37,ThingsAreMoving,"Several characters playing ""Hangman"" with Clovis as the hangman"
28-10-2017T16:36:41,BluePhantom90,No there was one With Nat and Zen become Adelaide's children
28-10-2017T16:36:42,unsteddyphoenix,"its...really weird, this song lol"
28-10-2017T16:36:43,HeroKing7077,"I never seen these guys before, who are they?"
28-10-2017T16:36:45,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Hm.......So, those are the ones that won eh?  Well, two of the three I voted for won."
28-10-2017T16:36:49,MviluUatusun,Okay.  I'm back.
28-10-2017T16:36:53,Sammit,Wb
28-10-2017T16:36:55,TorqueEmUp,"but even for a fantasy game, having lyrics not in a folk style song is quite odd."
28-10-2017T16:36:56,drykeon,@things how does that work?
28-10-2017T16:36:58,djikoz,wb

28-10-2017T16:37:04,LeKnightWolf,can we bring up an idea that isn't on romance
28-10-2017T16:37:06,FenceEqualizer,It's not bad. Just was not expecting it

28-10-2017T16:39:17,ThingsAreMoving,we had some suggestions with mecha I think
28-10-2017T16:39:20,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Hm..........Say, what sort of mobile suits would Natani pilot?"
28-10-2017T16:39:25,ThingsAreMoving,they didn't get through

28-10-2017T19:07:00,ThingsAreMoving,Figuring the most efficient and easy way to do stuff is great.
28-10-2017T19:07:05,unsteddyphoenix,Are you still playing Divinity with w0lf and them?
28-10-2017T19:07:11,Terryschannel,Gn eb

28-10-2017T19:07:37,ThingsAreMoving,Yeah coop up to 4 players
28-10-2017T19:07:39,FenceEqualizer,It's fun as hell
28-10-2017T19:07:48,ProsePro7,Well this is only my eight stream so I guess I am kind of a newbie
28-10-2017T19:07:50,MarvTheHugPharaoh,have you made any lore on the biggest wolf?
28-10-2017T19:07:52,Twokinds,"It can be played single player, but it's also a lot of fun with each character in the party controlled by a person."
28-10-2017T19:07:54,FenceEqualizer,They even have a weird D&D mode.
28-10-2017T19:08:06,Dimensional,heheh
28-10-2017T19:08:07,ThingsAreMoving,It is very time consuming tho
28-10-2017T19:08:09,unsteddyphoenix,Is combat easier with 4 people?
28-10-2017T19:08:15,FenceEqualizer,Kind of?
28-10-2017T19:08:20,ThingsAreMoving,It took me and my friend almost 30hrs to get out from act 1
28-10-2017T19:08:21,Ordithus,"Adios, amigos."
28-10-2017T19:08:22,unsteddyphoenix,I assume less silly mistakes are made
28-10-2017T19:08:26,Xexanoth,When my Friends played the first one they killed all the important NPCs in the first Village by accident...
28-10-2017T19:08:29,ThingsAreMoving,just because we had to explore everything
28-10-2017T19:08:31,Twokinds,Depends on how well you work together.

28-10-2017T19:26:59,unsteddyphoenix,Animal voice actors all deserve adwards
28-10-2017T19:27:05,Twokinds,It really adds to the charm of the game.
28-10-2017T19:27:07,Combak,Which game?

28-10-2017T19:27:10,TorqueEmUp,Ehh I just don't have it in me bgr.
28-10-2017T19:27:16,ThingsAreMoving,Divinity 2: Original Sin
28-10-2017T19:27:17,Twokinds,All the voice actors are surprisingly good.
28-10-2017T19:27:27,Twokinds,Bethesda could learn a thing or two.
28-10-2017T19:27:29,Dadrobit,Truly I am in the wrong field
28-10-2017T19:27:30,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah, seriously"
28-10-2017T19:27:48,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Bethesda could use more then two VAs

28-10-2017T19:28:49,unsteddyphoenix,Worth
28-10-2017T19:29:07,ThingsAreMoving,I'm still hoping EA will release Darkspore to the fans and let them run it on private servers with no monetization.
28-10-2017T19:29:11,w0lfmare,I'm super impressed that the sequel came out even better
28-10-2017T19:29:16,ThingsAreMoving,Like with Battleforge
28-10-2017T19:29:30,TorqueEmUp,Hoping EA will do anything is futile.
28-10-2017T19:29:39,FenceEqualizer,The Devs on Divinity know what's up.
28-10-2017T19:29:49,ThingsAreMoving,Well they did release Battleforge to the fans
28-10-2017T19:29:53,unsteddyphoenix,Give them money yall
28-10-2017T19:30:05,FenceEqualizer,But I need food
28-10-2017T19:30:08,Serpentfrog,:ctwokinds-adiracoin:
28-10-2017T19:30:28,ThingsAreMoving,I need monies to buy myself a house. Can't start a family without a house.
28-10-2017T19:30:54,Xexanoth,are you fucking the house? O.o
28-10-2017T19:30:57,ZizzoGaming,:ctwokinds-adiracoin:
28-10-2017T19:30:58,unsteddyphoenix,Buying a house? In current year?
28-10-2017T19:30:59,FenceEqualizer,Just get a very big van.
28-10-2017T19:31:05,unsteddyphoenix,Nice joke
28-10-2017T19:31:13,FenceEqualizer,And unsteddy has made me sad.
28-10-2017T19:31:18,TorqueEmUp,"Get and RV, then you can take your house anywhere"
28-10-2017T19:31:21,TorqueEmUp,an*
28-10-2017T19:31:45,ThingsAreMoving,"Why not, I am currently working in UK, and planning to go back to my country and buy a house"
28-10-2017T19:32:01,Dadrobit,"Sister did that for a year, said it was the worst year of her life"
28-10-2017T19:32:10,ThingsAreMoving,I guess in 4 years I'll have enough for a 4 bedroom house
28-10-2017T19:32:11,FenceEqualizer,Riding a RV?
28-10-2017T19:32:23,Dadrobit,"Aye, lived in an RV"
28-10-2017T19:32:28,TorqueEmUp,"RVs kinda suck in Europe. Too damn small, since roads as so damn small. lol"
28-10-2017T19:32:30,ZizzoGaming,"Things, what country are you from?"
28-10-2017T19:32:32,FenceEqualizer,Hopfully the economy won't get worse.
28-10-2017T19:32:35,Bgrmystr2,maybe if you get a shitty RV yeah
28-10-2017T19:32:38,BluePhantom90,So Tom are there Silver Foxes in Twokinds world?
28-10-2017T19:32:40,Bgrmystr2,there are some nice ones
28-10-2017T19:32:45,ThingsAreMoving,I'm from Poland
28-10-2017T19:33:04,ThingsAreMoving,You can get a decent house for about 100k$ here
28-10-2017T19:33:09,TorqueEmUp,Basically RVs in europe are nothing BUT big vans. :P
28-10-2017T19:33:12,FenceEqualizer,I'm not surprise. I feel like you have to have a certain mentality to drive/live in a rv for a year.
28-10-2017T19:33:38,ThingsAreMoving,"No, wait, that figure is pretty high. Make that 50k$"
28-10-2017T19:33:43,Xexanoth,dam
28-10-2017T19:33:48,Xexanoth,thats cheap
28-10-2017T19:33:51,TorqueEmUp,"Yeah, that's damn cheap"
28-10-2017T19:33:52,ThingsAreMoving,With 100k you could get a small mansion
28-10-2017T19:34:03,FenceEqualizer,....
28-10-2017T19:34:07,Dadrobit,100k is roughly the price range for a decent house in my area.
28-10-2017T19:34:19,ThingsAreMoving,"Yeah, but you guys earn a bit more"
28-10-2017T19:34:20,FenceEqualizer,California sucks.
28-10-2017T19:34:23,TorqueEmUp,"my folk's house is a single story with a basement, built in the 50s, and they bought it in 80s in the $50k range."
28-10-2017T19:35:00,drykeon,real houses are more like 250k
28-10-2017T19:35:07,unsteddyphoenix,Here its like 600k average
28-10-2017T19:35:16,Dadrobit,yo fuck that
28-10-2017T19:35:19,FenceEqualizer,600k For like a closet.
28-10-2017T19:35:30,unsteddyphoenix,Rich foreigners op
28-10-2017T19:35:31,ZizzoGaming,In the US $100k might get you a cabin
28-10-2017T19:35:33,Dadrobit,I'm staying right here it would seem
28-10-2017T19:35:50,TorqueEmUp,Depends on where in the U.S
28-10-2017T19:36:01,ThingsAreMoving,That's weird considering how much unused space you guys have in the US
28-10-2017T19:36:03,FenceEqualizer,I guess if you avoid the major city areas.
28-10-2017T19:36:13,FenceEqualizer,Unused space!?
28-10-2017T19:36:17,ThingsAreMoving,Unless it's in some major cities
28-10-2017T19:36:36,TorqueEmUp,"You can still get decent, but small houses for like $50k, nothing modern, but all modern houses are are plywood pieces of shit they overcharge for."
28-10-2017T19:36:56,ThingsAreMoving,Well I'm looking at population map and you have loooooooooads of unused ground
28-10-2017T19:37:01,FenceEqualizer,It really depends on the area. U.S is getting packed.
28-10-2017T19:37:07,Bgrmystr2,"the US is massive though, Things."
28-10-2017T19:37:19,Xexanoth,"yeah, but no one want's to live in the ""unused"" area"
28-10-2017T19:37:27,FenceEqualizer,Freaking nice areas getting torn down to make more houses and stores.
28-10-2017T19:37:32,TorqueEmUp,^
28-10-2017T19:37:40,ThingsAreMoving,that's the problem
28-10-2017T19:37:42,Bgrmystr2,"and a lot of the unused areas are unused for a reason. Mountains, or heat, farmland, etc etc"
28-10-2017T19:37:51,TorqueEmUp,Happening all around me right now. building more and more $200k+ houses that aren't worth a damn.
28-10-2017T19:38:25,Dadrobit,"Yeah, most of central US is allllll Farms"
28-10-2017T19:38:34,Bgrmystr2,yup
28-10-2017T19:38:37,TorqueEmUp,"You want a nice house here in the states, you need to live in debt for the rest of your life. lol"
28-10-2017T19:38:38,FenceEqualizer,Farm land wouldn't be so bad.
28-10-2017T19:38:45,TorqueEmUp,or just get really lucky. lol
28-10-2017T19:39:01,Bgrmystr2,a lot of the population live in major cities on rivers or ocean ports
28-10-2017T19:39:16,Dadrobit,Looking at prices in my area now. You probably wouldn't want to spend less than 150k on ahouse.
28-10-2017T19:39:23,Bgrmystr2,because shipping was how they rose
28-10-2017T19:39:29,FenceEqualizer,Why's that?
28-10-2017T19:39:39,Dadrobit,lots of trailer park houses below 150k
28-10-2017T19:39:40,MarvTheHugPharaoh,someone say shipping?
28-10-2017T19:39:46,Bgrmystr2,no marv
28-10-2017T19:39:54,MarvTheHugPharaoh,because I want to live on a boat
28-10-2017T19:40:08,Bgrmystr2,it burned in the last chapter :V
28-10-2017T19:40:11,ThingsAreMoving,"So, Dakota or Nebraska is mostly farmlands?"
28-10-2017T19:40:23,Bgrmystr2,all the ships burned xD
28-10-2017T19:40:24,ThingsAreMoving,cuz I see it's not highly populated
28-10-2017T19:40:26,TorqueEmUp,I rent an apartment. roughly $650 a month split down the middle with my roommate. Only thing I wish I had was a garage to work on my cars. lol
28-10-2017T19:41:19,Bgrmystr2,"those are rather far north, Things"
28-10-2017T19:41:22,Bgrmystr2,and very landlocked
28-10-2017T19:41:36,Bgrmystr2,not easy to get a lot of goods and services there
28-10-2017T19:41:49,Bgrmystr2,not a lot of people are there so there's less reason to populate it
28-10-2017T19:42:12,ThingsAreMoving,"yeah, but if people populate them, the goods will start flowing"
28-10-2017T19:42:21,ThingsAreMoving,but I get your point
28-10-2017T19:42:31,FenceEqualizer,Just got to convince people to move there.
28-10-2017T19:42:38,drykeon,those places are just not as desireable
28-10-2017T19:42:46,Bgrmystr2,there's no  desire to live there
28-10-2017T19:42:48,TorqueEmUp,"I've actually seen some pretty nice Trailerpark houses. My grandmother use to live in one that was two trailers side by side, you wouldn't know it was a trailer unless you crawled into the crawl space underneath the house."
28-10-2017T19:42:51,Bgrmystr2,cuz they're not near the coast lol
28-10-2017T19:42:56,Serpentfrog,It's Greenland all over again.
28-10-2017T19:43:03,ThingsAreMoving,"I wouldn't want to live someplace where my nextdoor neighbour is 20miles away, lol"
28-10-2017T19:43:15,FenceEqualizer,You have a point.
28-10-2017T19:43:28,Bgrmystr2,plus you have to go through a mountain range no matter which direction
28-10-2017T19:43:32,TorqueEmUp,"had a carport, and was in a really nice neighborhood withother old folks"
28-10-2017T19:43:34,Bgrmystr2,costs money
28-10-2017T19:43:51,ThingsAreMoving,"So what, we are going to wait for teleportation to happen before we populate those areas?"
28-10-2017T19:43:58,drykeon,no
28-10-2017T19:44:04,FenceEqualizer,Just give it 200 years.
28-10-2017T19:44:07,Bgrmystr2,"it's easier, cheaper, and more efficient to just live on the coast where everything is convenient to get."
28-10-2017T19:44:13,drykeon,because even with teleportation there is no reason to live there
28-10-2017T19:44:15,ThingsAreMoving,and expensive
28-10-2017T19:45:09,FenceEqualizer,Still waiting on Flying cars. we're not seeing teleportation for a while.
28-10-2017T19:45:24,drykeon,cars should never fly
28-10-2017T19:45:39,Bgrmystr2,teleportation of goods would be extremely beneficial in spreading how far away from the coast civilization gets.
28-10-2017T19:45:42,TorqueEmUp,"People can't even drive cars on the ground properly, and you want to give them flying cars?"
28-10-2017T19:45:44,ThingsAreMoving,only smartcars should fly
28-10-2017T19:45:45,Dadrobit,"Yeah, Torque, those are roughly what you get for 100k out here. They're not terrible, but having lived in one myself, I prefer a good foundation house."
28-10-2017T19:45:50,Bgrmystr2,"yes, Torque"
28-10-2017T19:45:51,FenceEqualizer,That's fine. I'll settle for augmentative VR
28-10-2017T19:45:55,ThingsAreMoving,I would never trust a common Joe to pilot a car
28-10-2017T19:45:56,Combak,"We could have flying cars, it just doesn't make economic sense. Teleportation we don"
28-10-2017T19:46:17,Bgrmystr2,"Think of it this way. When you get flying cars, the FIRST thing all the people who are SHIT at driving will do is crash"
28-10-2017T19:46:28,Bgrmystr2,"and it's more than likely they may not be able to drive again, if ever"
28-10-2017T19:46:34,FenceEqualizer,So you just have to wait it out
28-10-2017T19:46:40,Combak,"... don't have yet,  but it will probably involve getting torn apart by subatomic blades and molecularly reconstructed elsewhere."
28-10-2017T19:47:12,FenceEqualizer,Honestly never liked apartments. It's just too crowded.
28-10-2017T19:47:35,FenceEqualizer,And all it'll take is one jerk to mess up the area for like 15 other people.
28-10-2017T19:48:07,TorqueEmUp,"luckily we don't have that ""jerk"""
28-10-2017T19:48:08,drykeon,you will cease to exist and your clone will live your life
28-10-2017T19:48:12,Dadrobit,My folks bought a couple homes when the economy went into the shitter and now they rent them. I'm currently one of their tennants lol.
28-10-2017T19:48:15,ThingsAreMoving,I'm pretty happy with my current house.
28-10-2017T19:48:50,FenceEqualizer,Hopfully they give you a nice discount.
28-10-2017T19:48:56,ThingsAreMoving,"4 bedrooms (small, but oh well) for 950 pounds + 400 pounds for bills"
28-10-2017T19:49:20,Dadrobit,"Yeah, they're being nice."
28-10-2017T19:49:23,ThingsAreMoving,Only problem is there's only one toilet
28-10-2017T19:49:36,Bgrmystr2,RIP
28-10-2017T19:49:39,TorqueEmUp,"400 for bills? sheesh, what do you have in there, a car payment? lol"
28-10-2017T19:49:41,Dadrobit,Mostly because I helped refurbish the houses for them lol
28-10-2017T19:49:43,Bgrmystr2,4 bedroom only 1?
28-10-2017T19:49:48,Bgrmystr2,you need two imo
28-10-2017T19:49:49,ThingsAreMoving,yup
28-10-2017T19:49:52,ThingsAreMoving,nope
28-10-2017T19:50:02,ThingsAreMoving,"I mean, a second would be nice"
28-10-2017T19:50:04,Bgrmystr2,2 at least for a 4 bedroom
28-10-2017T19:50:18,ThingsAreMoving,technically it's a 3 bedroom
28-10-2017T19:50:27,Bgrmystr2,"if you don't have at least two, the designer didn't bother thinking about the people living in the house"
28-10-2017T19:50:30,ThingsAreMoving,but we don't need a living room so we made a bedroom out of it xD
28-10-2017T19:50:40,Zebranky,"In college I lived in a 3-bedroom, with a total of 7 people, and one bathroom"
28-10-2017T19:50:41,Bgrmystr2,3 bedroom should still have 2
28-10-2017T19:50:56,Dadrobit,Fuck that Zeb

28-10-2017T19:51:20,TorqueEmUp,geez
28-10-2017T19:51:25,Bgrmystr2,1 is too little.
28-10-2017T19:51:29,MarvTheHugPharaoh,FenceEqualizer did you use bathroom as a verb?
28-10-2017T19:51:51,Bgrmystr2,no he didn't
28-10-2017T19:51:54,ThingsAreMoving,"Enjoy your ease of access to simple plumbing amenities, people."
28-10-2017T19:52:04,Zebranky,"It was a pretty gross toilet, yes. And this was a school-owned apartment. :/"
28-10-2017T19:52:31,Zebranky,"Heh, touche."
28-10-2017T19:52:36,FenceEqualizer,Did I?

28-10-2017T20:00:07,FenceEqualizer,Jeopardy
28-10-2017T20:00:25,ThingsAreMoving,Is that the game that makes you put answers as a question?
28-10-2017T20:00:42,ZizzoGaming,"okay, thanks. now i got it"
28-10-2017T20:00:43,Combak,Yes

28-10-2017T20:01:09,Bgrmystr2,"Let's go with 'Thanks, Captain Obvious' for $800, bob."

28-10-2017T20:02:25,Bgrmystr2,"Things, are you drunk?"
28-10-2017T20:02:48,ThingsAreMoving,"Give me a break, I said I've watched it back in the 90's"
28-10-2017T20:02:57,Bgrmystr2,that's not what I was referencing
28-10-2017T20:02:58,Bgrmystr2,xD
28-10-2017T20:03:01,ThingsAreMoving,that's about 20 years ago
28-10-2017T20:03:23,Bgrmystr2,I was referencing where you asked if it was the game that made you answer in questions
28-10-2017T20:03:39,Bgrmystr2,"also, I haven't seen it since the 90s as well"
28-10-2017T20:04:02,ThingsAreMoving,Oh. So unknowingly I've made an answer... Oooooooh
28-10-2017T20:04:08,ThingsAreMoving,no longer confus

28-10-2017T20:17:35,Combak,It's not bad so long as it isn't too old.
28-10-2017T20:17:39,LeKnightWolf,what does it..
28-10-2017T20:17:40,Bgrmystr2,depends on what kind
28-10-2017T20:17:43,Bgrmystr2,but generally sugar
28-10-2017T20:17:46,MidnightBlue78,"tastes like sadness, disappointment, regrets, lost hopes and dreams"
28-10-2017T20:17:53,LeKnightWolf,wow.
28-10-2017T20:17:55,Bgrmystr2,"prolly had a bad batch, Midnight"
28-10-2017T20:18:03,MidnightBlue78,no
28-10-2017T20:18:13,LeKnightWolf,that's so much for something so little
28-10-2017T20:18:15,MidnightBlue78,that shit's nasty
28-10-2017T20:18:21,Bgrmystr2,so is that what suger tastes like to you too?

28-10-2017T20:18:36,MidnightBlue78,"No, just candy corn xD"
28-10-2017T20:18:43,LeKnightWolf,"never had one,"
28-10-2017T20:18:45,LeKnightWolf,.'
28-10-2017T20:18:51,Bgrmystr2,"I think you taste buds may be broken, midnight, just sayin :P"
28-10-2017T20:18:55,MidnightBlue78,you're blessed
28-10-2017T20:19:01,MidnightBlue78,nope xD
28-10-2017T20:19:02,Bgrmystr2,I'm not saying they're GOOD or anything like that
28-10-2017T20:19:09,Bgrmystr2,but they're not as bad
28-10-2017T20:19:25,Bgrmystr2,not nearly as bad as ppl say lol
28-10-2017T20:20:00,LeKnightWolf,well what now. So do you all have some ideas to talk about?
28-10-2017T20:20:02,FenceEqualizer,Candy corn is alright.
28-10-2017T20:20:04,MidnightBlue78,i think i'm going trick or treating this year
28-10-2017T20:20:05,FenceEqualizer,Rather have real candy
28-10-2017T20:20:19,Bgrmystr2,it's no more or less real candy than anything else we have lol
28-10-2017T20:20:25,MidnightBlue78,i wonder if i coukd make people believe i'm a kid
28-10-2017T20:20:40,Bgrmystr2,"probably some people, midnight"
28-10-2017T20:20:43,MidnightBlue78,i prefer chocolate though
28-10-2017T20:20:50,LeKnightWolf,yeah its nice.
28-10-2017T20:20:53,Bgrmystr2,but mostly kids who don't actually know how to tell the difference
28-10-2017T20:20:56,FenceEqualizer,Tell that to the kids who throw candy corn away
28-10-2017T20:21:04,MidnightBlue78,"with my height, i might fool them"
28-10-2017T20:21:18,FenceEqualizer,Or the parents who let that stuff meld into some biological mess.
28-10-2017T20:21:23,MidnightBlue78,i just need a cheap mask from walmart
28-10-2017T20:21:35,FenceEqualizer,...Or that one weird kid who only eats the white part of candy corn.
28-10-2017T20:21:56,Bgrmystr2,didn't they make the three parts as different flavors?
28-10-2017T20:21:59,Bgrmystr2,back in the early 90s?
28-10-2017T20:22:03,Bgrmystr2,or mid 90s?
28-10-2017T20:22:08,Bgrmystr2,I remember something about that
28-10-2017T20:22:25,FenceEqualizer,Did they? Never could tell. Figure you just eat that stuff whole.
28-10-2017T20:22:43,Bgrmystr2,"well if you ate it whole, of course you couldn't tell xD"
28-10-2017T20:23:09,Bgrmystr2,"I recall there was something about it, but not sure whether it was rumor or true or what the story was"
28-10-2017T20:23:15,MidnightBlue78,"i know i've seen different types of candy corn, different colors"
28-10-2017T20:23:16,LeKnightWolf,:expressionless:listening to the piano right now...
28-10-2017T20:23:27,Bgrmystr2,I mostly ate those candy pumpkins more than the corn

28-10-2017T21:10:11,Twokinds,Playing Mario reminds me of when I was a kid
28-10-2017T21:10:33,BluePhantom90,oh never played Mario
28-10-2017T21:10:38,Dadrobit,Know that feeling. It's always odd coming back down
28-10-2017T21:10:47,Bgrmystr2,RIP Blue
28-10-2017T21:10:51,BluePhantom90,well besides the carts one
28-10-2017T21:11:26,MidnightBlue78,i thougth everyone's played mario at some point in their lives
28-10-2017T21:11:47,unsteddyphoenix,It's like a rite of passge
28-10-2017T21:11:54,unsteddyphoenix,To be like...a human.
28-10-2017T21:11:56,MidnightBlue78,true
28-10-2017T21:12:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
28-10-2017T21:12:40,MidnightBlue78,"i wasnt  very successful at it, i guess thats why my life is a mess xD"
28-10-2017T21:12:58,unsteddyphoenix,Hahaha
28-10-2017T21:13:01,MidnightBlue78,cuz i sucked at playing mario :ctwokinds-LauraCry:
28-10-2017T21:13:14,TorqueEmUp,Ahh picked up Mario Odyssey? I am quite enjoying it myself right now.
28-10-2017T21:13:17,MidnightBlue78,hehehe
28-10-2017T21:14:38,unsteddyphoenix,Oooh Tom was the older brother playing Mario though.
28-10-2017T21:14:56,unsteddyphoenix,"It sucks being the older sibling in multiplayer, there's no challenge. :/"
28-10-2017T21:15:16,TorqueEmUp,Well Mario wasn't about being competitive really. :P
28-10-2017T21:15:32,TorqueEmUp,Well not the main games anyway
28-10-2017T21:15:46,MidnightBlue78,"i wonder if  he let mark play, with the remote that wasnt connected xD"
28-10-2017T21:15:50,unsteddyphoenix,It's about LOVE and FRIENDSHIP
28-10-2017T21:15:55,unsteddyphoenix,Hahaha
28-10-2017T21:16:05,unsteddyphoenix,"That's the best move, can recommend"
28-10-2017T21:16:06,Dadrobit,I was player 2 so much...
28-10-2017T21:16:19,TorqueEmUp,I don't think there is that big of an age divide between Tom an Mark for Tom to have been doing that. lol
28-10-2017T21:16:21,FenceEqualizer,Nothing wrong with green mario.
28-10-2017T21:16:26,MidnightBlue78,older siblings always did that
28-10-2017T21:16:51,Dadrobit,I was always on the right side of the screen in fighting games. To be anywhere else now feels weird.
28-10-2017T21:16:53,MidnightBlue78,why did no one want to be Luigi? He was alright
28-10-2017T21:16:54,TorqueEmUp,"I didn't with my little brother, he just got to sit out. lol he liked watching me play games anyway."
28-10-2017T21:17:19,BluePhantom90,had a little sister. The real game I played was Pokemon Blue
28-10-2017T21:17:32,TorqueEmUp,"brother is only 3 years younger than I was so, yeah."

28-10-2017T21:18:13,TorqueEmUp,"3 brothers, no sister :D"
28-10-2017T21:18:19,BluePhantom90,My sister made me do most of the gaming for her
28-10-2017T21:18:27,Dadrobit,"2 brothers, 3 sisters"
28-10-2017T21:18:40,Dadrobit,2nd youngest
28-10-2017T21:18:50,TorqueEmUp,"Older brothers were long gone, technically only half brothers, but still brothers nonetheless"
28-10-2017T21:19:02,TorqueEmUp,long gone I mean out of the house
28-10-2017T21:19:09,TorqueEmUp,not dead :P
28-10-2017T21:19:17,unsteddyphoenix,Oh good

28-10-2017T22:50:38,BluePhantom90,oooookay
28-10-2017T22:50:48,OwenStarr,"Personally, I like Nat the best, but Raine's a close second."
28-10-2017T22:51:20,BluePhantom90,-nods- yeah I understand that. Raine hasn't been really flushed out fully yet
28-10-2017T22:51:34,OwenStarr,Yeah
28-10-2017T22:52:01,ZizzoGaming,"I like Laura, Trace, Nat, Raine, Flora"
28-10-2017T22:52:42,BluePhantom90,I like Flora but same issue. Not fully drawn out yet. But yeah Nat is second with Kat and Keith.
28-10-2017T22:55:55,BluePhantom90,wonder if more characters will join the group
28-10-2017T23:02:20,BluePhantom90,huh well gtg
