23-11-2017T00:19:12,Combak,I'm going to break this combo.
23-11-2017T00:19:36,BluePhantom90,lol I was about too but refused lol

23-11-2017T00:27:40,MidnightBlue78,so rood :ctwokinds-eyeroll:
23-11-2017T00:27:49,Combak,:p
23-11-2017T00:27:52,Combak,Night all.
23-11-2017T00:28:02,MidnightBlue78,lol
23-11-2017T00:28:16,MidnightBlue78,good night Combak
23-11-2017T00:37:02,FenceEqualizer,The best part of thanksgiving? The annual standing in line for a hour black friday Christmas shopping!
23-11-2017T00:38:13,BluePhantom90,well not really. Black Friday come sooner and sooner even before Thanksgiving
23-11-2017T00:44:57,FenceEqualizer,Ain't that the truth.
23-11-2017T00:58:12,FenceEqualizer,But I love giving gifts to family and can save a ton on black Friday. :ctwokinds-adiracoin:
23-11-2017T00:59:28,BluePhantom90,Eh your not really saving money. You save more money after Christmas. Because everyone wants to sell their supplies to get next years supplies
23-11-2017T01:02:21,FenceEqualizer,True but a slight flaw with that plan.
23-11-2017T01:02:38,FenceEqualizer,It's after Christmas.
23-11-2017T01:02:41,BluePhantom90,"yeah yeah its ""After Christmanst"""
23-11-2017T01:03:28,FenceEqualizer,The after christmas sale is for me. If I have money to spare.
23-11-2017T01:04:09,BluePhantom90,My family kinda do Christmas after Christmas since sales are so much better after.
23-11-2017T01:07:38,FenceEqualizer,You have a patience family. Though dang it it's a good plan.
23-11-2017T01:08:47,FenceEqualizer,Unless you have kids who believe in Santa. Might be hard to explain to them why Santa gave them an I.O.U
23-11-2017T01:10:33,BluePhantom90,"well my family have different religions. I am Wiccan, Mother is I think Buddhist, and my Step Dad has his Birthday on the 27th. and my Step brother has a kid but we do small things on Christmas and the big stuff after"
23-11-2017T01:15:03,FenceEqualizer,"Wait, Wiccan? As in, excuse if i'm being insensitive, Witchcraft?"
23-11-2017T01:32:10,FenceEqualizer,That's pretty interesting if it is. Never really hear people talk about it. Though guess that's usually the case unless it's the bigger religions.
23-11-2017T01:33:46,BluePhantom90,Well I am more of a open minded wiccan that do what I want and use what I learn to go though life. Witchcraft I have done but pentagrams are bad luck for me. I created my own symbol
23-11-2017T01:36:55,BluePhantom90,"Some Wiccan's create their own symbols. Mine is based on the body, mind, and soul."
23-11-2017T09:51:59,BluePhantom90,morning all

23-11-2017T19:03:41,DukeTheCat,than*
23-11-2017T20:03:21,BluePhantom90,kinda odd not hearing from Tom?

23-11-2017T20:05:06,MidnightBlue78,not at all odd
23-11-2017T20:05:46,MidnightBlue78,there are days when he's not in chat
23-11-2017T20:23:51,CaptainJack,top of the evening
23-11-2017T20:25:15,CaptainJack,tom has been somewhat late with updates and patreon recently do you guys think that maybe itâ€™s because of the way hes is describing his health recently
23-11-2017T20:27:16,BluePhantom90,could be. I open my window today to get some fresh air
23-11-2017T20:34:09,BluePhantom90,Like everyone should to freshen up the air you already have

23-11-2017T21:39:02,Dadrobit,"Mhmm, back when I was in security, I had nothing else to do except watch late night streams. Nowadays I have an almost normal-ish schedule"
23-11-2017T21:39:34,Dadrobit,It can be rough staying up past one just to chill in a chat.

23-11-2017T21:49:18,MarvTheHugPharaoh,and suddenly the chat turned into fairy tail
23-11-2017T21:49:25,SageSaga,considering i just asked him if he was ok and his answer was that hes Miserable? i dont think so

23-11-2017T21:55:51,Bgrmystr2,or a show :thinking:
23-11-2017T21:55:52,Dadrobit,Also a mecha anime
23-11-2017T21:55:57,Bgrmystr2,Iwin :v
23-11-2017T21:56:02,Dadrobit,&gt;.&gt;
23-11-2017T21:56:12,Bgrmystr2,great minds tho
23-11-2017T21:56:16,Bgrmystr2,as they say
23-11-2017T21:56:26,Dadrobit,"Indeed, it was a good show as I recall"
23-11-2017T21:56:29,BadFoMo,@Dadrobit I thought that was Roger Smith's gient robot?
23-11-2017T21:56:39,BadFoMo,*giant
23-11-2017T21:56:40,Bgrmystr2,"it was the title too, Fomo"
23-11-2017T21:56:42,Dadrobit,Yup
23-11-2017T21:57:21,Dadrobit,I think I watched some of it not so long ago for nostalgia's sake and found it a little vacuous.
23-11-2017T21:57:40,Dadrobit,"Not bad, but not as epic as I recalled as a kid."
23-11-2017T21:57:42,ZRO4825,BIG OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!
23-11-2017T21:57:55,GeneralIrrelevant,It's show time!
23-11-2017T21:58:02,ZRO4825,"the robot maid was awesome, even though I can't remember her name, lol"
23-11-2017T21:58:30,BadFoMo,There was just something about the music that I liked.
23-11-2017T21:58:38,ZRO4825,It had good music as I recall
23-11-2017T21:58:53,ZRO4825,ya know what was awesome as a kid though? The original Batman The Animated Series.
23-11-2017T21:58:56,Dadrobit,"Yeah, the artistic direction was on point"
23-11-2017T21:59:13,BadFoMo,R. Dorthy Wainright?
23-11-2017T21:59:17,BluePhantom90,heh Tom juggling around trying to set up I take.

23-11-2017T21:59:42,BadFoMo,I most likely miss speled the last name.
23-11-2017T21:59:47,BadFoMo,Hi?
23-11-2017T21:59:48,Dadrobit,Big O and one of the Batman series was made by the same studio actually
23-11-2017T22:00:20,ZRO4825,Really? I thought Big-O was japanese anime :thinking:
23-11-2017T22:00:24,ZRO4825,was a*
23-11-2017T22:00:52,BadFoMo,@neropan Is that you talking?

23-11-2017T22:01:41,ZRO4825,I'm not opposed to this ideal.

23-11-2017T22:01:47,Dadrobit,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrise_(company)
23-11-2017T22:02:04,Dadrobit,Sunrise also did the Batman series
23-11-2017T22:02:18,BadFoMo,Which one?
23-11-2017T22:02:34,Dadrobit,92-95
23-11-2017T22:02:42,Dadrobit,Batman the Animated Series
23-11-2017T22:02:44,Bgrmystr2,"It was made in Japan, but brought to the US like any other."
23-11-2017T22:02:47,ZRO4825,"So, that would've been original series, yeah"
23-11-2017T22:02:51,BadFoMo,I think I liked that one.
23-11-2017T22:03:04,ProsePro7,Tyger Tyger

23-11-2017T22:15:20,unsteddyphoenix,Same
23-11-2017T22:15:32,SageSaga,the idea is she lost her top when her giant floppy breasts destroyed a layer of cake as she popped out
23-11-2017T22:15:50,MarvTheHugPharaoh,amazing
23-11-2017T22:15:54,SageSaga,NERO

23-11-2017T22:16:13,Bgrmystr2,"Well, it's pretty obvious by te image, Sage"
23-11-2017T22:16:20,Bgrmystr2,so I'd consider that a success.

23-11-2017T22:17:39,Mihari,"Well if they are locking arms, Kaylin could just be holding her up too"
23-11-2017T22:17:44,Bgrmystr2,that's true.
23-11-2017T22:17:46,ZRO4825,Either that or Nyna's just being held off the ground by Kaylin's elfy strength :P
23-11-2017T22:17:50,ZRO4825,Damnit Mihari! :rofl:

23-11-2017T22:27:08,SageSaga,no Toyoko feels embarrassment- she just gets into things a lot and shes a bit ditzy
23-11-2017T22:27:14,LannAF,Anytime bud
23-11-2017T22:27:23,LannAF,well. Not anytime. Unless I win the lottery.
23-11-2017T22:27:25,LannAF,Then most of the time.

23-11-2017T22:29:26,ZRO4825,Chinese if you're feeling daring. Pizza if you'd rather be safe.
23-11-2017T22:29:34,ZRO4825,So much cake. So much Toyoko. &lt;3

23-11-2017T22:30:22,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: Wouldn't that mean you should just get pizza?
23-11-2017T22:30:42,SageSaga,how is Chinese a gamble?
23-11-2017T22:30:53,LannAF,someone said chinese if you're feeling daring
23-11-2017T22:31:02,SageSaga,where the heck are you ordering chinese food from that its a gamble?
23-11-2017T22:31:09,LannAF,Also most of my family agrees chinese is a higher chance of getting sick at times.
23-11-2017T22:31:11,unsteddyphoenix,Not china
23-11-2017T22:31:33,LannAF,"idk man I just want something cheap and filling, I haven't eaten anything today"
23-11-2017T22:31:47,Flake,i only ever buy sushi

23-11-2017T22:32:25,Flake,how about NOPE
23-11-2017T22:32:38,SpotTheLeopard,so it could be a gamble to randomly order Chinese &gt;.&gt;

23-11-2017T22:41:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,\[T]/
23-11-2017T22:41:29,ZRO4825,\[T]/
23-11-2017T22:42:39,ZRO4825,:thinking: Maybe I can get some more money in the bank and commision you a little extra to color it later on? :P
23-11-2017T22:46:05,SageSaga,hmm if ya want Zro
23-11-2017T22:46:11,ZRO4825,=D
23-11-2017T22:46:26,Bgrmystr2,Color would look nice on that image
23-11-2017T22:46:41,Matthew250,"This seems a little nsfw for a birthday pic, Sage. But still... Happy Birthday!"
23-11-2017T22:46:41,SageSaga,brb
23-11-2017T22:46:52,ZRO4825,Righto~
23-11-2017T22:46:56,Bgrmystr2,"Lol Matt, Blame Zro."
23-11-2017T22:47:14,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-right:
23-11-2017T22:47:51,Tharkis,ooh i see a nyna
23-11-2017T22:48:01,Tharkis,go afk a bit come back and it's all kitties !
23-11-2017T22:48:24,ZRO4825,And titties.
23-11-2017T22:48:29,MarvTheHugPharaoh,lol
23-11-2017T22:48:30,Tharkis,"yes, thsoe too lol"
23-11-2017T22:48:31,ZRO4825,Kittie and titties everywhere!
23-11-2017T22:48:37,SageSaga,"nonsense Matt, i used to go to work dressed in only cake and frosting all the time and no one said a thing"
23-11-2017T22:48:54,ZRO4825,I'd show it to my co-workers. :P
23-11-2017T22:49:02,Mihari,"I could blame ZRO, but he's just the enabler :P"
23-11-2017T22:49:14,ZRO4825,"Hell, I'll take all the blame for it either way! :rofl:"
23-11-2017T22:49:15,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
23-11-2017T22:51:24,Zakuru,i hate drawing blades of grass....
23-11-2017T22:51:35,SageSaga,but its so easy
23-11-2017T22:51:51,w0lfmare,She's in her birthday suit obviously
23-11-2017T22:52:19,w0lfmare,"Though, maybe there was some miscommunication involved..."
23-11-2017T22:53:24,Mihari,"If I had a time machine and could only use it to go back once and return, I'd go kill the person who came up with non-canon."
23-11-2017T22:54:41,unsteddyphoenix,Bit of a waste
23-11-2017T22:54:47,ZRO4825,Would you prefer Uncanonized? :thinking:
23-11-2017T22:55:27,SageSaga,Mihari just likes characters to stay true to their character regardless of what fans want
23-11-2017T22:55:36,Mihari,Your right I'd kill the person who came up with puns.
23-11-2017T22:55:41,Mihari,Much better.
23-11-2017T22:55:57,unsteddyphoenix,"Better, but idk. Still seems like a missed oppertunity."
23-11-2017T22:56:01,ZRO4825,"I'm on the fence. I like seeing them stay in character, but sometimes it's nice to see some OOC stuff."
23-11-2017T22:56:05,unsteddyphoenix,"Could do something cool, like kill yourself as a baby"
23-11-2017T22:56:23,unsteddyphoenix,Thats what id do
23-11-2017T22:56:31,unsteddyphoenix,Uh
23-11-2017T22:56:33,Zakuru,:/
23-11-2017T22:56:35,unsteddyphoenix,:thinking:
23-11-2017T22:56:39,Bgrmystr2,"I love Marisa to bits, but it'd be nice if she wasn't a legitimate kleptomaniac. So really, non-canon is fine IMO"
23-11-2017T22:56:52,SageSaga,little known fact- i dont want anyone even jokingly saying to kill themselves
23-11-2017T22:56:55,Bgrmystr2,Nothing is perfect
23-11-2017T22:57:03,ZRO4825,"idk Bgr, somehow having her canonically described as having ""naughty fingers"" is kinda hilarious"
23-11-2017T22:57:10,Bgrmystr2,xD'
23-11-2017T22:57:15,Bgrmystr2,of course it is
23-11-2017T22:57:41,Bgrmystr2,but that description doesn't need to change just because she stops being a kleptomaniac. :ptv-SteelwormHades:
23-11-2017T22:57:57,unsteddyphoenix,Guess i'd just take candy from myself then
23-11-2017T22:58:01,unsteddyphoenix,PG version
23-11-2017T22:58:06,ZRO4825,Maybe it wasn't talking about her kleptomania to begin with? :o
23-11-2017T22:58:16,Bgrmystr2,Maybe it wasn't
23-11-2017T22:58:49,Nekonny,"Has anyone here played ""Soma""?"
23-11-2017T22:59:03,Nekonny,It really made me think
23-11-2017T22:59:09,Nekonny,even about AI
23-11-2017T23:01:08,Nekonny,Would be really freaky if Kaylin is just an artificial construct with the consciousness of Kevin implanted
23-11-2017T23:01:19,Nekonny,Imagine the system just kept runnign on the PC
23-11-2017T23:01:45,Nekonny,and that some thing happened in the real world that killed off everyone else
23-11-2017T23:02:04,Nekonny,"Sorry, that game just made me think a lot about it"
23-11-2017T23:03:26,w0lfmare,Watch Nekonny accidentally guess the plot
23-11-2017T23:03:59,SageSaga,the real world does play a major roll in the story much later
23-11-2017T23:04:29,SageSaga,next chapter i drop a bit of a bombshell
23-11-2017T23:05:13,ZRO4825,O_O
23-11-2017T23:05:20,ZRO4825,starts building shelter now.
23-11-2017T23:07:43,unsteddyphoenix,ooo
23-11-2017T23:08:26,Tharkis,cant wait for bombshell now !
23-11-2017T23:08:47,Tharkis,forges armor to protect from bombs :ctharkis-smithing:
23-11-2017T23:09:58,Bgrmystr2,"Just so you guys are aware, bombshells don't always contain bombs. Could be empty."
23-11-2017T23:10:09,Bgrmystr2,Potentially.
23-11-2017T23:10:10,w0lfmare,"By the way Sage, I'd love to chat sometime about story writing"
23-11-2017T23:10:27,Bgrmystr2,"But feel free to prepare. This is sage, after all. xD"
23-11-2017T23:13:38,ZRO4825,I am....maybe prepared.
23-11-2017T23:14:28,SageSaga,you have a way to chat with me outside of Picarto?
23-11-2017T23:14:50,w0lfmare,Discord should work
23-11-2017T23:15:18,MrAMP,OH!  I know that girl.
23-11-2017T23:15:23,MrAMP,it's the two tail hottie from AI!
23-11-2017T23:15:41,MarvTheHugPharaoh,nyna
23-11-2017T23:17:18,Tharkis,Nyna's awesome and we hardly even know her yet =D
23-11-2017T23:17:20,BluePhantom90,"Hey Neko you should have included this Video to your paprika. Should have done this, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaA_cs4WZHM"
23-11-2017T23:17:28,Zakuru,hue
23-11-2017T23:17:31,Zakuru,fool
23-11-2017T23:17:31,MarvTheHugPharaoh,lol
23-11-2017T23:19:34,BadFoMo,What happened?
23-11-2017T23:19:55,Bgrmystr2,Sage removed a message.
23-11-2017T23:20:03,BluePhantom90,Oh I posted a link to something Neko should have used. Still could use it in his Comic
23-11-2017T23:20:03,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
23-11-2017T23:20:04,MidnightBlue78,yep
23-11-2017T23:20:31,Bgrmystr2,Sounds about right
23-11-2017T23:20:40,Bgrmystr2,removed as per norm
23-11-2017T23:21:18,Tharkis,"noo, come back nekonny!"
23-11-2017T23:21:24,GeneralIrrelevant,Nekonny ded!
23-11-2017T23:21:24,Tharkis,:ctharkis-ewok:

23-11-2017T23:21:25,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Ron, Ron, RON!!!!!!!"
23-11-2017T23:21:28,GeneralIrrelevant,:cgeneralirrelevant-c9:
23-11-2017T23:21:38,ZRO4825,"Ladies and....men, we have lost our cat."
23-11-2017T23:21:38,OmniOtter,:clordmagicpants-ewokcheri:
23-11-2017T23:21:45,MarvTheHugPharaoh,he's back
23-11-2017T23:21:46,Bgrmystr2,hahaha is that face a meme or something I don't know about? xDD
23-11-2017T23:21:46,ZRO4825,"Wait, false alarm, he came back, we're okay!"
23-11-2017T23:22:09,unsteddyphoenix,\o/
23-11-2017T23:22:11,ZRO4825,"OBS crash, or OBS disconnect there, Nekonny?"
23-11-2017T23:23:27,Nekonny,Kinda?
23-11-2017T23:23:38,Nekonny,It should be back up
23-11-2017T23:23:53,ZRO4825,"It is, was just curious if OBS was still doing that random disconnect thing"
23-11-2017T23:30:51,Nekonny,no
23-11-2017T23:30:59,Nekonny,"see, I wanted to listen to youtube"
23-11-2017T23:31:07,Nekonny,but obs turns down the volume
23-11-2017T23:31:30,ZRO4825,ahhh
23-11-2017T23:33:08,Zakuru,yeah i hate it when it does that
23-11-2017T23:36:27,SageSaga,my OBS doesnt do that
23-11-2017T23:37:08,w0lfmare,Strange
23-11-2017T23:37:15,BluePhantom90,hmm Wondering how sick Tom is feeling
23-11-2017T23:38:36,ZRO4825,Sick enough that he's too weak to stream properly apparently
23-11-2017T23:38:46,Zakuru,wehk
23-11-2017T23:38:51,Nekonny,its a win thing
23-11-2017T23:38:59,Nekonny,same thing happens with skype
23-11-2017T23:39:18,Bgrmystr2,You can disable that
23-11-2017T23:39:30,BluePhantom90,hmm?
23-11-2017T23:39:39,Bgrmystr2,it's an audio option that turns down other stuff on your computer when you're on VOIP or whatnot.
23-11-2017T23:39:55,Bgrmystr2,you can disable it entirely
23-11-2017T23:40:31,ZRO4825,"(And should, because it's stuuuuuupid)"
23-11-2017T23:40:45,Bgrmystr2,yeh I disabled it long ago
23-11-2017T23:40:49,Bgrmystr2,when I installed windows lol
23-11-2017T23:54:27,Nekonny,how do you do that?
23-11-2017T23:54:30,Nekonny,where is it?
23-11-2017T23:57:33,w0lfmare,"I'm off for tonight, thanks for streaming you three!"
23-11-2017T23:57:47,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nighty night W0LFY!!!!!!
