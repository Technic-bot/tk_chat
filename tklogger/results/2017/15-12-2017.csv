15-12-2017T11:18:14,neropan,ooi
15-12-2017T11:28:26,Tharkis,:ctharkis-earwiggle:
15-12-2017T11:35:35,Tharkis,have you given names to any of these characters yet? hehe
15-12-2017T11:36:21,denmander,do you need to?
15-12-2017T11:37:45,neropan,ay tharkii o/
15-12-2017T11:38:59,neropan,not yet tho
15-12-2017T11:39:46,neropan,but i'll need it soon
15-12-2017T11:42:46,sunblaze,hiya everyone!
15-12-2017T11:45:44,neropan,ayo~
15-12-2017T12:04:37,KDhynamo,Oh boy a Neropan
15-12-2017T12:06:13,Tharkis,ack a KD
15-12-2017T12:06:16,Tharkis,get it!
15-12-2017T12:06:24,Tharkis,flails :ctharkis-duster: at KDhynamo
15-12-2017T12:06:53,KDhynamo,initiates dodge maneuvers
15-12-2017T12:07:42,Tharkis,"muwahahah, dusters are a blunt force attack combined with an AOE cloud! you cant dodge the aoe even if it doesnt hit you !"
15-12-2017T12:10:43,neropan,OOO
15-12-2017T12:16:08,Tharkis,"hrm, what size canvas to you use nero?"
15-12-2017T12:16:18,Tharkis,pixelwise that is
15-12-2017T12:17:38,neropan,preset a4-300 dpi
15-12-2017T12:17:50,Tharkis,i think half the trouble i had with my nekonny doodle the other day was my canvas was tiny and i didnt realize it
15-12-2017T12:18:37,Tharkis,"well, half the mechanical trouble.  the fact that i only can draw stick figures and havent drawn in 20 years is why it's ugly and stuff"
15-12-2017T12:19:08,KDhynamo,BUNNI
15-12-2017T12:19:29,Tharkis,ahah!  the preset on my canvas is 5x7 inches 72 pixel/inch
15-12-2017T12:19:47,Tharkis,so my resolution is waayy too low
15-12-2017T12:19:47,KDhynamo,or maybe just a cool headpiece
15-12-2017T12:20:05,Tharkis,"she's a bun bun , and wicked cute based on the drawings nero did last night"
15-12-2017T12:20:06,KDhynamo,yeah that's like a baby canvas
15-12-2017T12:20:25,Tharkis,"hehe, well you saw in your discord just how msall the image was right?"
15-12-2017T12:20:30,KDhynamo,yeah
15-12-2017T12:20:36,Tharkis,"turns out that was 100% size, and i was drawing with it zoomed 200%"
15-12-2017T12:20:59,Tharkis,"and tryignm to figure out how the hell i was suplposed to squeeze more detail in it, when i was already only using a 4 pixel brush"
15-12-2017T12:21:45,Tharkis,"i totally dont draw, but Nekonny pestered me a bunch saying i should at least try &gt;_&lt; hence  the 2 doodles i did last week lol"
15-12-2017T12:22:00,KDhynamo,it's a start!
15-12-2017T12:22:04,Tharkis,"well, 3 if you include the MSPaint stickfig character sheet lol"
15-12-2017T12:22:12,Tharkis,but that was drawn with a trackball
15-12-2017T12:22:14,Tharkis,in MSPaint
15-12-2017T12:22:17,Tharkis,so that doesnt count lol
15-12-2017T12:22:38,KDhynamo,more bunnies! \o/
15-12-2017T12:23:15,Tharkis,"hrm, A4 is 8.5x11 inches?"
15-12-2017T12:23:36,Tharkis,my editor doesnt have preset for standard paper sizes (15year old version of photoshop CS1)
15-12-2017T12:23:36,KDhynamo,"a bit bigger, but yeah basically"
15-12-2017T12:23:54,neropan,"8,2x 11,6"
15-12-2017T12:23:57,Tharkis,"oh there we go, it was under a different menu"
15-12-2017T12:24:05,Tharkis,210 mm x 297mm
15-12-2017T12:24:12,denmander,my first digital drawing ended up in over 11000x8000 pixels
15-12-2017T12:24:19,KDhynamo,2342342 units by 34535333 units
15-12-2017T12:24:27,neropan,why xD
15-12-2017T12:24:30,Shaze,I felt a Nero in the force O.O
15-12-2017T12:24:54,Tharkis,did you ask nero for consent before you felt him?! :ctharkis-ewok:
15-12-2017T12:24:59,neropan,woa
15-12-2017T12:25:02,Tharkis,love those claws
15-12-2017T12:25:41,Shaze,I am Shaze! I don't need no consent. Nero accepted this long ago
15-12-2017T12:26:31,denmander,right...
15-12-2017T12:27:30,Tharkis,kicking myself now that i didnt pick up CSP EX when it was on sale for the same price as CSP Pro while i wasin chicago
15-12-2017T12:28:00,Tharkis,i got this wacom tablet up and running on wednesday
15-12-2017T12:28:20,Tharkis,and promptly discovred that i keep tryign to rotate the tablet in my lap to rotate the image on screen... which doesnt work &gt;_&lt;
15-12-2017T12:28:35,Tharkis,so i then tried to see if i could bind a button to rotate canvas on screen or something
15-12-2017T12:28:44,Tharkis,and found out that there is no option in photoshop CS1 to do so
15-12-2017T12:28:47,Tharkis,=/
15-12-2017T12:29:45,Tharkis,"or i should say there is, but it's not a logical rotation, you can only do it by changing the actual picture to be at an angle"
15-12-2017T12:29:47,denmander,photoshop has a rotate tool
15-12-2017T12:30:02,Tharkis,maybe newer versions =D
15-12-2017T12:30:15,KDhynamo,Gah she cute
15-12-2017T12:30:40,Tharkis,"photoshop CS1 only has 'rotate canvas"" -&gt; input angle, it changes what's on the canvas to be at an angle, but leaves the canvas size and shape the same"
15-12-2017T12:32:49,denmander,"it was implemented in 2009, anything older won't have it"
15-12-2017T12:33:35,Tharkis,my copy is from 2003
15-12-2017T12:33:50,Tharkis,got it with student discount during my last year of college
15-12-2017T12:34:54,KDhynamo,going to draw this bun later just because
15-12-2017T12:36:19,neropan,shes the same as this bun
15-12-2017T12:36:37,Shaze,Looks very Final Fantasy
15-12-2017T12:37:01,Tharkis,"i 'd like to draw a neropan fan art, but i cant draw and i dont want ot insult his characters &gt;_&lt;"
15-12-2017T12:37:26,neropan,go for it
15-12-2017T12:37:31,denmander,and now you know why I don't do fan art Tharkis
15-12-2017T12:37:33,neropan,:ptv-excited:
15-12-2017T12:37:44,KDhynamo,are any of these your new OCs

15-12-2017T12:39:40,Tharkis,=P
15-12-2017T12:39:53,denmander,"If he just made a random sketch once, does it even count as a oc?"
15-12-2017T12:40:38,Tharkis,"he drew like 6 or 7 of that character, so yes !"
15-12-2017T12:42:08,CuteNikeChan,aa this art style is adorablee ♥

15-12-2017T14:40:52,Tharkis,"if he catches up wtih one giant bulk dump, then it'll be easier for him to stay caught up if he keeps posting =)"
15-12-2017T14:44:53,CuteNikeChan,he could always post stuff little by little ~ that way it seems like hes active to his followers without having to draw too often ~
15-12-2017T14:45:23,neropan,there are some many pics that ican post a chunk little by little tho

15-12-2017T15:03:16,ZRO4825,Just cuz it's back on doesn't necessarily mean it's better. :P
15-12-2017T15:03:17,sunblaze,hi
15-12-2017T15:03:40,ZRO4825,Mine likes to do that sometimes where it doesn't QUITE go down all the way and keeps coming back with less than optimal connection &lt;.&lt;;
15-12-2017T15:04:01,SageSaga,considering the issue last night was a local Node dying and it being gone means i had no internet- i am now here- so the node is obviously fixed-
15-12-2017T15:04:11,neropan,sagy~~
15-12-2017T15:04:25,ZRO4825,Hurray for fixed nodes.

15-12-2017T15:20:14,SageSaga,Nero - did i guess right already?

15-12-2017T15:26:41,ZRO4825,"And lol, shoulda known it was you Shaze &lt;3"
15-12-2017T15:27:06,Shaze,XD not hard to figure out. I'm pretty typical.
15-12-2017T15:27:25,ZRO4825,"Yeah, lol. Hey, nothing wrong with it if ya enjoy it =D"
15-12-2017T15:31:30,Shaze,Shaze is a good little canine boy with the best weakness :P
15-12-2017T15:34:16,ZRO4825,XD
15-12-2017T15:37:32,FoxxTrotter,^_^
15-12-2017T15:40:01,SageSaga,so I got to play Monster Hunter World this past Monday
15-12-2017T15:40:15,Shaze,How was it?
15-12-2017T15:40:28,SageSaga,fantastic
15-12-2017T15:40:59,SageSaga,a friend of mine invited me over to try it out- some of his online friends wanted to play so we had a little team and well- they sucked
15-12-2017T15:41:48,Shaze,Lol fair enough. Monster Hunter is just better with people in general. :) So excited for the PC release
15-12-2017T15:41:52,SageSaga,"they were like ""Let's try and take down the Sand Dragon!"" and i was like ""It's name is Diablos"""
15-12-2017T15:42:09,sunblaze,did you still have fun?
15-12-2017T15:42:19,sunblaze,and lol sage MH-nerd
15-12-2017T15:42:52,SageSaga,"yeah- it was funny though because they were like ""Man this thing is so hard!"" and i was like ""I havent died once"" ""how?"" ""It's called dodging"""
15-12-2017T15:43:01,Shaze,Have not played with my friend's since the days of Freedom Unite and me discovering the Ukonloss stun lock method
15-12-2017T15:44:21,SageSaga,"they were then like ""Well you've fought this thing before"""
15-12-2017T15:44:54,SageSaga,"and i was like ""Actually ive never fought against a Diablos before. He wasnt in 4U or MHGen"
15-12-2017T15:44:59,Tharkis,"i really liked the animations for the spear use, or whateve tehyr'e calling it in MHworld"
15-12-2017T15:45:14,Tharkis,i need whatever weapon i'm using to look cool when i'm using it =D
15-12-2017T15:45:41,Tharkis,"really didnt care for the animations on sword and board, the big 2h swords, or the 2h axe thing they call an axe but looks like a giant club"
15-12-2017T15:45:50,SageSaga,the Insect Glaive?
15-12-2017T15:46:07,Tharkis,yeah i think that's what it was the glaive
15-12-2017T15:46:28,SageSaga,and do you mean the switch Axe?
15-12-2017T15:46:36,SageSaga,the axe that turns into a sword
15-12-2017T15:46:58,Tharkis,yes that was it
15-12-2017T15:47:02,Shaze,I like the Switch Axe but I'm a gunlancer at heart
15-12-2017T15:47:24,SageSaga,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsltopn6Zis
15-12-2017T15:47:34,Tharkis,i liked the animations for bow use too
15-12-2017T15:47:38,neropan,15 min break
15-12-2017T15:47:50,SageSaga,all the weapons are awesome if you know how to use em
15-12-2017T15:47:58,Shaze,Loving it Nero
15-12-2017T15:48:41,ZRO4825,"I think when I was playing the demo I only ever died against the hardest one, and that's cuz I went with a completely inappropriate weapon for soloing at my current knowledge level, lol"
15-12-2017T15:48:46,neropan,:ptv-hearts:
15-12-2017T15:49:06,Tharkis,it's more the animations for using them that i didnt care for on a lot of weaps hehe
15-12-2017T15:49:13,Shaze,Could still use more boobage tho :ptv-uneasy:
15-12-2017T15:49:42,Shaze,:ptv-laugh:never enough boobage for Shaze
15-12-2017T15:49:48,Tharkis,"loved the animations for the gun lance, for the bow, and some others"
15-12-2017T15:49:54,SageSaga,im very familiar with the animations- ive studied them quite thorough
15-12-2017T15:49:57,Tharkis,really didnt like the animations for some of the ohthers
15-12-2017T15:50:13,Tharkis,i think the most egregiously akward looking oen for me was the warhorn thing
15-12-2017T15:50:22,Tharkis,hunting horn?
15-12-2017T15:50:25,SageSaga,hunting horn yes
15-12-2017T15:50:42,Shaze,The support weapon. I used it for a while
15-12-2017T15:50:46,Tharkis,some of the weaps look so smooth and natural in use
15-12-2017T15:50:48,SageSaga,you gotta remember that the Monster Hunters are basically super human
15-12-2017T15:52:02,Tharkis,insect glaive and bow were my favorites in the little bit i played around with
15-12-2017T15:52:27,SageSaga,any normal person trying to block a blow from a diablos with a shield would just get pulverized- a Monster Hunter just flinches
15-12-2017T15:52:52,Tharkis,though bow was difficult keeping hte right range
15-12-2017T15:53:05,Tharkis,seemed like my rocks always fell infront of the monster without landing on them
15-12-2017T15:54:03,Tharkis,i liked the grenades/moarters wiht the heavy bowgun they were fun
15-12-2017T15:54:11,SageSaga,you can use the reticle to see where the heavy shot will land
15-12-2017T15:55:14,KDhynamo,lookin good nero
15-12-2017T15:58:11,sunblaze,nyna's last expression is strange
15-12-2017T15:58:30,sunblaze,kinda wierded out pissed off and several other just all at once
15-12-2017T15:58:38,sunblaze,certainly unsure
15-12-2017T16:01:17,ZRO4825,"Well, it's pretty much what would be the case, lol"
15-12-2017T16:01:31,ZRO4825,"I mean, it's basically a ""wtf I'm tryign to kill you but you kissed me and WTH!"" look :P"
15-12-2017T16:02:27,sunblaze,true WTF at its best
15-12-2017T16:05:33,SageSaga,brb water time
15-12-2017T16:07:30,Tharkis,i cant wait for Bright next week
15-12-2017T16:07:36,Tharkis,i hope it does smashingly well
15-12-2017T16:07:40,Tharkis,so they do a whole series
15-12-2017T16:08:18,SageSaga,i hope so
15-12-2017T16:08:37,Tharkis,only thing i'ts missing to be like shadowrun the movie is deckers =P
15-12-2017T16:08:44,Tharkis,or they dont call them deckers anymore do they?
15-12-2017T16:08:50,Tharkis,been so long since i did a shadowrun campaign
15-12-2017T16:10:21,SageSaga,some still call em deckers
15-12-2017T16:10:59,SageSaga,but the decks are pretty much gone - replaced by AR and VR comlinks
15-12-2017T16:12:50,SageSaga,but they call Otaku Technomancers now
15-12-2017T16:20:13,KDhynamo,the winking one is &lt;3
15-12-2017T16:20:40,Shaze,Haruka is a very seductive tease for sure
15-12-2017T16:25:55,TreasureVault,"otaku is a funny word, I prefer weeb tho"
15-12-2017T16:26:03,TreasureVault,le weaboo americano
15-12-2017T16:26:42,SageSaga,its not the otaku you are thinking of
15-12-2017T16:27:43,TreasureVault,it isn't?
15-12-2017T16:28:01,TreasureVault,I guess there are different variations
15-12-2017T16:28:04,TreasureVault,mkay then
15-12-2017T16:28:15,SageSaga,im taking about Shadowrun Otaku not anime otaku
15-12-2017T16:28:27,neropan,aaa
15-12-2017T16:28:27,neropan,lil break again
15-12-2017T16:28:46,TreasureVault,Ah gotcha
15-12-2017T16:29:41,Shaze,This is wonderful Nero
15-12-2017T16:30:31,neropan,:ptv-excited:
15-12-2017T16:37:20,SageSaga,brb
15-12-2017T16:41:41,SageSaga,back
15-12-2017T16:42:17,ZRO4825,wb ^_^
15-12-2017T16:42:41,jayroejohnson,whoa - neropan
15-12-2017T16:47:05,jayroejohnson,melon pan &gt; currypan
15-12-2017T16:47:13,jayroejohnson,neropan &gt; melon pan
15-12-2017T16:49:55,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-sleepy: gmornin guys
15-12-2017T16:50:13,SageSaga,yo Bgr
15-12-2017T16:50:32,ZRO4825,"Mornin Bgr, finally sleep did ye? lol"
15-12-2017T16:50:54,Bgrmystr2,finally got enough sleep after being woken up every 2 hrs :ptv-unimpressed:
15-12-2017T16:51:23,ZRO4825,"Ugh, hate that"
15-12-2017T16:51:46,ZRO4825,"Also, I'm blaming you guys. I was on Forze Horizon till like 8am my time. :joy:"
15-12-2017T16:51:51,ZRO4825,Forza*
15-12-2017T16:52:16,SageSaga,how the heck is that our fault? we never encouraged that behavior
15-12-2017T16:52:19,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-laugh: Your fault. We'll take the blame for it though.
15-12-2017T16:52:26,Bgrmystr2,"@Zro, specifically"
15-12-2017T16:52:48,Bgrmystr2,"but you can take it if you like sage, the blame is made up and and the fault doesn't matter :D"
15-12-2017T16:54:06,SageSaga,i would never encourage people to play games about driving cars
15-12-2017T16:54:10,SageSaga,driving cars is boring
15-12-2017T16:54:42,SageSaga,unless its rocket powered RC cars playing soccer/Football
15-12-2017T16:54:52,Bgrmystr2,bah
15-12-2017T16:56:00,Bgrmystr2,"it's not a driving car game, it's a racing game :v"
15-12-2017T16:56:19,SageSaga,same thing
15-12-2017T16:56:38,Bgrmystr2,"nuh, very different. cuz they have like.. driving simulators."
15-12-2017T16:56:50,Bgrmystr2,like.. Eurotruck simulator?
15-12-2017T16:56:52,SageSaga,yeah so its even more boring
15-12-2017T16:56:54,Bgrmystr2,if I recall correctly
15-12-2017T16:57:06,SageSaga,now you dont go anywhere- you just go along a preset track
15-12-2017T16:57:15,Bgrmystr2,why would you think racing is boring? ;o
15-12-2017T16:58:01,SageSaga,because it is intensely boring doing the same thing - who likes running around in circles?
15-12-2017T16:58:15,Bgrmystr2,xD it isn't nascar
15-12-2017T16:58:55,SageSaga,it's slightly less circular Nascar- can you throw shells at your enemies?
15-12-2017T16:59:32,Bgrmystr2,why would you want to? Throwing shells takes zero skill and it's all RNG whether you get it or not
15-12-2017T16:59:57,SageSaga,bull crap- there are aiming mechanics
15-12-2017T17:00:15,SageSaga,and every item has a use and you can always get more
15-12-2017T17:01:06,Bgrmystr2,"It still rotates around the items, not the racing skill."
15-12-2017T17:01:08,SageSaga,its the only way to make a racing game interesting - gotta blow stuff up
15-12-2017T17:01:29,Bgrmystr2,that does the opposite for me
15-12-2017T17:01:32,Bgrmystr2,xD
15-12-2017T17:01:38,SageSaga,"yeah because racing is hardly a skill- its boring ""Oh no i didnt take that corner as tightly as i could- guess i lose now"""
15-12-2017T17:02:00,SageSaga,"""Gotta hope they screw up now"""
15-12-2017T17:02:36,Bgrmystr2,xD that's not even remotely true. there's a hell of a lot of skill involved in racing simulators. a lot more than just angle and wallbounce mechanics for shooting green shells
15-12-2017T17:02:51,SageSaga,racing games are some of the most boring tiresome forms of games imaginable
15-12-2017T17:03:12,ZRO4825,I beg to differ personally :P
15-12-2017T17:03:16,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: I would too
15-12-2017T17:03:34,ZRO4825,Given how difficult it is to accurately get a vehicle around a track in as small a time as possible with consistent results ^_^
15-12-2017T17:03:58,ZRO4825,"But yeah, NASCAR can feck right off on that matter XD"
15-12-2017T17:04:21,SageSaga,yeah boy- i always love how a games main attribute is completing it faster than everyone else and only that
15-12-2017T17:04:47,SageSaga,only to see the scoreboard has someone who completed a match in an impossibly low time
15-12-2017T17:04:57,ZRO4825,Isn't that what leaderboards are in just about every game though? See who can get it done faster/better/higher score?
15-12-2017T17:05:08,SageSaga,yeah- and thats where Racing ends
15-12-2017T17:05:13,ZRO4825,Fighting games are about who can drop the other person's health to 0 first
15-12-2017T17:05:17,SageSaga,just a score board- nothing gained
15-12-2017T17:05:31,ZRO4825,"To be honest, they're games. We don't really gain anything from'em anyway. ^_^"
15-12-2017T17:05:40,ZRO4825,Except entertainment
15-12-2017T17:05:46,Bgrmystr2,it's not like you gain anything from something like mario kart either
15-12-2017T17:06:09,ZRO4825,"I mean, there's bragging rights, I suppose in all games :thinking:"
15-12-2017T17:06:10,Shaze,Bragging rights with roommates
15-12-2017T17:06:11,Bgrmystr2,"you shoot a shell at someone ahead of you, you win the race, same score"
15-12-2017T17:06:11,SageSaga,the rage you fester in your heart from Mario Kart is something you gain
15-12-2017T17:06:18,ZRO4825,lmao
15-12-2017T17:06:24,Bgrmystr2,yeah that's not actually a good thing Sage xD
15-12-2017T17:07:13,SageSaga,that feeling of vengeance when you send a guy from first to last with nothing but a banana peel...
15-12-2017T17:07:39,SageSaga,meanwhile y'all play your car porn game
15-12-2017T17:07:54,ZRO4825,I can do that with a PIT maneuver if I really need to (and if the game isn't pulling the AI-is-on-rails mechanic) :3
15-12-2017T17:08:07,Bgrmystr2,and that's why I don't like rng mechanics like that. Skill with vehicle and good racing lines mean literally nothing in Mario Kart :/
15-12-2017T17:08:24,Bgrmystr2,lol zro yeh
15-12-2017T17:08:29,Bgrmystr2,AI cars made of tank armor
15-12-2017T17:08:43,Bgrmystr2,impossble to pit
15-12-2017T17:08:44,SageSaga,The RNG of Mario Kart is to take out the boorishness of racing games
15-12-2017T17:09:28,Shaze,"The farther back you are, the better the items to help you catch up. Keeps the game competitive"
15-12-2017T17:09:49,Bgrmystr2,imo it only made it extremely unbalanced to whoever gets lucky with the rng boxes and rewards that luck instead of one's skill driving
15-12-2017T17:09:50,Shaze,Your not getting a lightning bolt if your in first
15-12-2017T17:10:01,SageSaga,instead of getting smoked because one guy took corners a little better for only the first 20 seconds
15-12-2017T17:10:18,SageSaga,driving skill is a pathetic skill though
15-12-2017T17:10:35,Bgrmystr2,^dis guy lol
15-12-2017T17:11:03,SageSaga,its more about memory of a track than skill
15-12-2017T17:11:47,ZRO4825,"I still beg to differ, both IRL and in-game, lol. Skill is about execution. Knowledge of a track means squat if you can't execute properly. ^_^"
15-12-2017T17:12:08,ZRO4825,Bgr can attest to that from last night. :P
15-12-2017T17:12:12,Bgrmystr2,"memory is important too, but that doesn't mean skill isn't a major requirement. exactly what zro said xD"
15-12-2017T17:12:13,ZRO4825,&lt;3
15-12-2017T17:12:23,Bgrmystr2,getouttahere &gt;;u
15-12-2017T17:12:45,ZRO4825,"It's just like art for that matter. I have LOTS of knowledge of how I want those pictures to end up. But I lack your skill in execution, Sage, and my end results therefore are...lacking."
15-12-2017T17:13:06,Crimellgrim,ey neropan
15-12-2017T17:13:21,Crimellgrim,my human firend
15-12-2017T17:13:25,neropan,ay cremlincream
15-12-2017T17:13:35,Bgrmystr2,heya Crim
15-12-2017T17:13:45,neropan,and you came right at the time i was going to take a  break
15-12-2017T17:13:54,neropan,i'm going *
15-12-2017T17:14:19,neropan,but ye thanks everywan for watching and i'll see you bery bery soon
15-12-2017T17:14:55,neropan,my eyes buuurn
15-12-2017T17:15:09,Bgrmystr2,thanks for streaming :D
15-12-2017T17:15:11,SageSaga,Racing games are boring to me without a purpose- executing things on a preset track has more to do with memory than anything else
15-12-2017T17:16:39,ZRO4825,to each their own. ^_^
15-12-2017T17:16:54,ZRO4825,"Memory goes to squat when there's other cars in the way though, just sayin. :P"
15-12-2017T17:17:20,SageSaga,you still need to make the same turns and again- when a car is in the way it comes down to who makes a mistake
15-12-2017T17:18:01,ZRO4825,"Yup, a battle of skill vs skill =D"
15-12-2017T17:18:54,SageSaga,a boring one where no matter how good you play  - if the person in front plays the exact same you never have a chance
15-12-2017T17:22:06,SageSaga,whats the difference between your current racing game and your last racing game?
15-12-2017T17:22:26,Tharkis,going to scoot for supper
15-12-2017T17:22:28,ZRO4825,"Car selection, better physics, better graphics"
15-12-2017T17:22:29,Tharkis,thanks for the streams !
15-12-2017T17:22:34,ZRO4825,Later Tharkis ^^/
15-12-2017T17:22:39,SageSaga,take care Tharkis
15-12-2017T17:22:40,Tharkis,:ctharkis-earwiggle:
15-12-2017T17:23:02,ZRO4825,"Overall updated UIs and such, different track selection. What's so different from the next iteration of whatever other genre? o.O"
15-12-2017T17:23:53,SageSaga,"FPS are innovating new things all the time, sometimes its a stall rehash but most of the time they try to find new ways to improve the gameplay itself"
15-12-2017T17:24:16,SageSaga,and when they cant do that- they add more story
15-12-2017T17:25:35,SageSaga,every version of Monster Hunter adds new mechanics
15-12-2017T17:25:59,ZRO4825,"There's campaign modes in racing as well, so we have story to go with as well. Never overall too deep, to be fair, but it exists."
15-12-2017T17:26:32,ZRO4825,"Plus there's always different styles of racing. Pure racing, knockout races, drift races, can go with destruction derby in some games as well."
15-12-2017T17:26:37,Bgrmystr2,"And driving games are the same thing. Instead of being more arcade-y, it adds better physics, better damage impacts, more accurate damage models and vehicle effects, better driving AI, etc etc"
15-12-2017T17:27:01,SageSaga,even though some racing games wont allow cars to be damaged still?
15-12-2017T17:27:13,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, because not all racing games are simulators"
15-12-2017T17:28:12,SageSaga,they dont allow damage on many because they are based on real cars and those manufacturers dont want them being damaged in the game
15-12-2017T17:28:31,ZRO4825,Tis a truth.
15-12-2017T17:28:39,ZRO4825,Not much that can be done 'bout that
15-12-2017T17:28:52,SageSaga,Racing games just arent very interesting unless you really like cars or really like racing- neither of which im interested in
15-12-2017T17:29:53,Bgrmystr2,"that doesn't make racing games inherently boring to everyone, though. Just you. Which is fine, but it's not inherent."
15-12-2017T17:30:10,SageSaga,Racing games sell less than every other game for a reason
15-12-2017T17:30:38,Bgrmystr2,"because they're niche, not because they're boring"
15-12-2017T17:30:39,SageSaga,"they sell less than ""Other"" XD"
15-12-2017T17:31:18,Bgrmystr2,"Nascar is HUGE, people find it amazing to watch. It's not inherently boring, even though it's a long track with four left turns."
15-12-2017T17:31:23,SageSaga,im pretty sure there is a correlation of them being niche and their being boring
15-12-2017T17:32:01,SageSaga,how is Nascar huge?
15-12-2017T17:32:03,ZRO4825,So not everyone likes cars and/or racing. That doesn't bother those of us who find it interestig. =D
15-12-2017T17:32:09,ZRO4825,Uh....dude...wut? o.O
15-12-2017T17:32:21,SageSaga,isnt Tennis more popular than Nascar?
15-12-2017T17:32:41,ZRO4825,I find way more people interested in NASCAR than I EVER do Tennis...
15-12-2017T17:32:56,SageSaga,in MURICA
15-12-2017T17:33:00,Bgrmystr2,"xD there really isn't a correlation though. Just because not everyone is interested in it does not mean the game is inherently boring. If it were, then absolutely everyone would find it boring, even people who love cars and racing"
15-12-2017T17:33:24,ZRO4825,"Well, we live in ""MURICA"" so it stands to reason we'd discuss it as such."
15-12-2017T17:33:33,ZRO4825,"And in the international scene, Le Mans racing is big too."
15-12-2017T17:33:39,ZRO4825,F1 as well.
15-12-2017T17:33:58,SageSaga,Baseball is still bigger than Nascar
15-12-2017T17:34:01,ZRO4825,"That being said, NASCAR isn't as poular as it once was."
15-12-2017T17:34:03,SageSaga,in Murica
15-12-2017T17:34:19,SageSaga,College Football is bigger too XD
15-12-2017T17:34:47,SageSaga,it does beat Basketball and the NHL though
15-12-2017T17:34:56,ZRO4825,"Yeah, but Football is stupid. ^_^"
15-12-2017T17:36:27,SageSaga,my point is - the majority of the world doesnt care much for racing games in general- the market is small and they arent innovating - so its boring and getting worse
15-12-2017T17:36:49,ZRO4825,Getting worse is a debatable point that I'm sure any fan of racing games will happily argue.
15-12-2017T17:37:14,SageSaga,they can argue but they cant be right- sales have declined too and less games are being made
15-12-2017T17:37:49,ZRO4825,"Less games are being made because it takes so damned long to make them. Gran Turismo just recently finally put out their first incarnation for the PS4. And it's been out for...what, 3 years now?"
15-12-2017T17:38:07,ZRO4825,"Forza in the meantime is still churning out like a game a year or so, iirc"
15-12-2017T17:38:34,SageSaga,how is it that they take so long to make?
15-12-2017T17:38:40,ZRO4825,"Forza Horizon 3 is a different case from most racing games, being in an open world environment"
15-12-2017T17:38:48,ZRO4825,Take about as long as any other game these days near as I can tell.
15-12-2017T17:39:03,SageSaga,im rather familiar with the process of making games and Racing seems to me to be one of the easier- its a lot easier to model cars than people for one
15-12-2017T17:39:32,Bgrmystr2,the car models isn't the hard part
15-12-2017T17:39:40,Bgrmystr2,"far as I know, it's the physics that's the hard part"
15-12-2017T17:39:46,ZRO4825,"It is. But getting physics engines working properly for wear and tear during a race is harder, along with determining grip levels for certain ranges of heat on the tires"
15-12-2017T17:39:58,ZRO4825,"Brake wear during a race, fuel consumption per how much the pedal is actually being used"
15-12-2017T17:40:00,SageSaga,but the physics arent that big of an issue either because you just fake it
15-12-2017T17:40:11,ZRO4825,Not in a simulation you don't
15-12-2017T17:40:13,Bgrmystr2,"if you fake it, then it's not a good simulator."
15-12-2017T17:40:21,SageSaga,bull crap
15-12-2017T17:40:29,ZRO4825,Not bullcrap at all.
15-12-2017T17:40:32,SageSaga,you have to fake everything in a game
15-12-2017T17:40:50,SageSaga,"you cant ""Simulate real world physics"" perfectly in a game"
15-12-2017T17:40:58,ZRO4825,They're running Gran Turismo simulation settings past F1 drivers who are authenticating its physics as being top notch.
15-12-2017T17:41:04,SageSaga,you have to fake every part people will notice
15-12-2017T17:41:14,ZRO4825,All games are faked by that logic.
15-12-2017T17:41:19,SageSaga,they are
15-12-2017T17:41:20,Bgrmystr2,xD
15-12-2017T17:41:25,ZRO4825,The point of a simulator is to get it as absolutely close to realism as possible.
15-12-2017T17:41:39,SageSaga,you dont do that by making the game PHYSICS better though
15-12-2017T17:41:46,SageSaga,you do it by making the outcome the same
15-12-2017T17:41:56,ZRO4825,Your logic makes no sense to me
15-12-2017T17:42:04,SageSaga,omg
15-12-2017T17:42:07,ZRO4825,The physics determine the outcome.
15-12-2017T17:42:11,Bgrmystr2,wait.. how would you change the outcome without changing the physics? O.o
15-12-2017T17:42:27,SageSaga,the physics arent physics- games dont run on the rules of the universe
15-12-2017T17:43:01,ZRO4825,"You're right, they run on a simulation of the rules of the universe, recreated as realistically as possible, assuming that's what they're aiming for."
15-12-2017T17:43:43,ZRO4825,"So, logically speaking, if your physics engine is working properly, performing an action across a section of road will produce the same results in-game as it will in reality."
15-12-2017T17:44:13,ZRO4825,"So, in effect, yes, your physics engine is looking to reproduce a result, but, it's also in place so that if a different input is used, then it changes the result."
15-12-2017T17:44:39,Bgrmystr2,It has to be close enough for real people to play and say it feels like it's driving on a real road. And driving simulators are doing so
15-12-2017T17:45:39,ZRO4825,A bit too much so at times for our own good. Stupid brake lock-ups. &lt;_&lt;;; Bane of my existence I tell ye.
15-12-2017T17:50:29,Bgrmystr2,grass still loves me :c
15-12-2017T17:50:32,SageSaga,uhg
15-12-2017T17:50:42,Bgrmystr2,what happen
15-12-2017T17:50:51,SageSaga,you two
15-12-2017T17:51:05,Bgrmystr2,:(
15-12-2017T17:51:17,ZRO4825,"We like our racing, and we disagree with your anti-racing viewpoints. No big deal really. Just differences of opinion. ^_^"
15-12-2017T17:51:19,SageSaga,i come back and see you think they are actually trying to recreate real world physics in a video game
15-12-2017T17:51:28,ZRO4825,Is there some reason they would not be?
15-12-2017T17:51:39,ZRO4825,That's been Gran Turismo's goal for years now.
15-12-2017T17:51:52,Bgrmystr2,"when the devs are going out of their way to say they are, and they have real F1 racers test it to confirm."
15-12-2017T17:52:03,SageSaga,its too much for computers to handle- their goal isnt to create real physics in a game- its to make it seem like there are real physics in a game
15-12-2017T17:52:03,Bgrmystr2,I mean.. kinda hard to argue with the results :thinking:
15-12-2017T17:52:55,ZRO4825,"Well, really Sage, you're just kinda arguing semantics at that point. Either you're recreating physics, or you're recreating a simulacrum of physics."
15-12-2017T17:53:13,ZRO4825,I think the end result kinda ends up the same
15-12-2017T17:53:17,SageSaga,true to a point
15-12-2017T17:53:25,Bgrmystr2,You should less worry about us and more worry about finishing the page. I don't wanna be distracting you or whatnot
15-12-2017T17:53:32,Bgrmystr2,:c
15-12-2017T17:53:49,ZRO4825,Well it's not like he doesn't have till Wed to work on it or anything. :P
15-12-2017T17:53:51,Bgrmystr2,though I'm very ok with this panel lol
15-12-2017T17:53:54,ZRO4825,And I rarely get to be here on Saturdays!
15-12-2017T17:53:54,SageSaga,it's just not as difficult as you make it out to be like they are some kinda masters of making real world physics in a game far beyond anything anyone has ever done!
15-12-2017T17:54:17,ZRO4825,"Oh we're not claiming they are. But as far as racing goes, they're getting DAMNED close."
15-12-2017T17:54:30,ZRO4825,"Also, I like Tsundere angry Nyna, lol."
15-12-2017T17:54:37,ZRO4825,Though smirking Kaylin is awesome as well.
15-12-2017T17:54:37,SageSaga,"and having worked in animation and ""dynamic physics"" before it triggers me :P"
15-12-2017T17:54:52,Bgrmystr2,tsundere angry? Not seeing it
15-12-2017T17:55:00,ZRO4825,That last panel? Really?
15-12-2017T17:55:08,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, not tsun"
15-12-2017T17:55:10,ZRO4825,Looks like Tsundere to me
15-12-2017T17:55:19,ZRO4825,But i get all these fuckin -eres mixed up at times I admit
15-12-2017T17:55:24,Bgrmystr2,not seeing it. level is very low
15-12-2017T17:55:34,SageSaga,"""Sir, these fluids dont seem to be moving as fast as i set them to"" ""Just decrease the frame rate then"" ""But then its not actually moving faster it just looks like it- "" ""Welcome to ""Game Physics"""
15-12-2017T17:56:20,Bgrmystr2,ahh workarounds. the corner-cutting of the gameindustry :v
15-12-2017T17:56:52,SageSaga,its not cutting corners- its how the job is done
15-12-2017T17:57:04,SageSaga,your racing car game do it all the time
15-12-2017T17:57:19,ZRO4825,I don't feel they're doing that near as much these days as you might think :o
15-12-2017T17:57:32,SageSaga,they have just gotten good at it
15-12-2017T17:57:41,Bgrmystr2,Just cuz they're doing it doesn't mean it's not cutting corners
15-12-2017T17:57:42,ZRO4825,"Mind you, not saying it's NOT being done at times, but I don't think it's being done to quite that level."
15-12-2017T17:58:29,SageSaga,the whole point is to create the illusion of a physics based world-
15-12-2017T17:59:04,SageSaga,if they didnt cut corners we wouldnt have games the way they are now- they would be 200 dollars a pop and take 10-20 years to make
15-12-2017T18:00:04,Bgrmystr2,"Well, at that point it wouldn't be a game, and would be a true simulator, and would be used literally by those who do what it simulates irl"
15-12-2017T18:00:38,ZRO4825,"Which iirc, Ferrari at least does have an actual simulator that their F1 racers use"
15-12-2017T18:01:04,SageSaga,simulators cut corners too - the difference is they keep more faults to simulate more real world issues
15-12-2017T18:05:00,SageSaga,"for example- wind turbulence in a Flight simulator isnt a complex algorithm determined by how you are flying - its based on a set of random values that are impacted by a chart on they set weather parameters, they didnt simulate air"
15-12-2017T18:08:48,SageSaga,"but yeah- my ranting was mostly me taking my Trolling too far and then getting triggered by ""Real World Game Physics"" :P"
15-12-2017T18:08:57,ZRO4825,lol
15-12-2017T18:09:33,ZRO4825,"It's a fair point on some issues, but I believe they ARE attempting to get as realistic results as possible. But yeah, you're right, trying to do 1:1 simulation would require a HELL of a lot of processing power."
15-12-2017T18:10:25,SageSaga,its one of the reasons i love MH so much- the effort put into the animations and how it looks like these people are using these giant weapons- it looks real
15-12-2017T18:11:05,SageSaga,its not like Cloud twirling around a sword 3 times his body weight like a baton
15-12-2017T18:11:26,SageSaga,it looks like the things they are carrying are heavy- and their impacts are solid
15-12-2017T18:12:12,SageSaga,and knowing all that is based on their hard work animating it to look and feel that way- its incredible
15-12-2017T18:12:41,SageSaga,meanwhile in school we were told if we wanted an easy job that everyone would marvel at- make a realistic car
15-12-2017T18:12:50,ZRO4825,"It's got a good feel to it, I agree. That being said, at times I hate how clunky it is, but, it is realistic."
15-12-2017T18:13:53,SageSaga,some weapons are fast and very responsive- but if you pick a heavy weapon you have to commit to your attacks
15-12-2017T18:16:09,SageSaga,if you could move around like a spider monkey while using a greatsword in MH it would be OP and would make a bunch of other weapons pointless
15-12-2017T18:17:13,SageSaga,"my friend was like ""Geez how are you so fast with the great sword? When i tried it it took me forever to get anywhere"""
15-12-2017T18:18:03,SageSaga,"i was like ""It's easy- Don't draw it till you are attacking- when it's time to move- roll- put it away- run- position - Draw it again"""
15-12-2017T18:18:40,SageSaga,meanwhile all the noobs are playing with dual blades
15-12-2017T18:19:13,ZRO4825,"lol, I actually didn't like how those were. I liked the feel of the giant sword much better."
15-12-2017T18:19:20,ZRO4825,Each hit felt like I actually DID something
15-12-2017T18:20:25,SageSaga,"i did the charge combo and my friend was like ""Holy crap! Did that just say 170?!"" and i was like ""Yeah- greatsword"" and he was like ""The highest number i saw with the guns was like 25!"""
15-12-2017T18:21:14,SageSaga,then i showed him that the bow has combos that go into power shots
15-12-2017T18:21:29,ZRO4825,lol
15-12-2017T18:22:18,SageSaga,"""how did you do that thing where you scrapped the arrow on the ground and made it explode?!' ""I hit - 2 buttons"" ""Wait their are combo buttons?"""
15-12-2017T18:22:52,SageSaga,but the light bow gun play was embarrassing for me
15-12-2017T18:23:10,SageSaga,the controls were changed
15-12-2017T18:23:24,SageSaga,but i kept hitting what it would be on the DS
15-12-2017T18:23:40,SageSaga,so i kept putting mines at my feet instead of shooting the monster =_=
15-12-2017T18:24:15,ZRO4825,doh
15-12-2017T18:24:28,ZRO4825,"I kept doing that on accident too, but that was just sheer unfamiliarity with me XD"
15-12-2017T18:24:34,SageSaga,i did do a cool thing with it though once- i screwed up and put a mine at my feet- and then the monster charged at me- i rolled to the side and shot the mine and he exploded
15-12-2017T18:24:42,ZRO4825,"Nice, lol"
15-12-2017T18:26:13,ZRO4825,"Are you just using a darker color brush there to add that in, or a separate layer with a specific effect?"
15-12-2017T18:26:14,SageSaga,i convinced my brother to hopefully bring his PS4 over for christmas
15-12-2017T18:26:44,SageSaga,im actually using a separate layer with a different color on multiply
15-12-2017T18:27:04,ZRO4825,Interesting
15-12-2017T18:27:22,ZRO4825,"You keep most of your tools stuff offscreen/covered, so I'm never completely sure, lol"
15-12-2017T18:27:55,SageSaga,feel free to ask
15-12-2017T18:28:05,SageSaga,im using a transparent watercolor brush for this too
15-12-2017T18:28:37,nekoanon,it seems that people in the comments guessed correctly:ctwokinds-clovischuckle:
15-12-2017T18:29:38,ZRO4825,lol
15-12-2017T18:30:21,SageSaga,its more surprising that some didnt considering Kaylin has mentioned before she can go for long periods of time without sleep
15-12-2017T18:30:48,ZRO4825,Is that a raster layer you're using for that?
15-12-2017T18:31:02,nekoanon,not the she not sleeping the nyana will learn more than she want to about kaylin
15-12-2017T18:31:25,SageSaga,Nyna
15-12-2017T18:31:36,SageSaga,and she hasnt learned more than she wants yet
15-12-2017T18:31:42,nekoanon,ok thanks for correcting me
15-12-2017T18:32:07,nekoanon,...yet:ctwokinds-reniembarrassed:
15-12-2017T18:32:11,ZRO4825,XD
15-12-2017T18:32:48,SageSaga,some people havent seen the other picture of Nyna and Kaylin
15-12-2017T18:33:05,SageSaga,pictures*
15-12-2017T18:34:18,nekoanon,haah
15-12-2017T18:34:22,nekoanon,*haha
15-12-2017T18:36:13,Bgrmystr2,ohello
15-12-2017T18:36:13,ZRO4825,"You need to redo that one in full color, Sage :P"
15-12-2017T18:36:39,SageSaga,i will when it happens in the comic
15-12-2017T18:37:01,nekoanon,:ctwokinds-reniderp::ctwokinds-reniembarrassed::ctwokinds-reniderp_flip:
15-12-2017T18:37:38,ZRO4825,"Oh, so that brush goes more opaque the harder you press, where the g-pen just goes bigger...alrighty then, that's learned for later"
15-12-2017T18:38:13,ZRO4825,God your pen control must be awesome then with the way you do this stuff O_o
15-12-2017T18:38:22,ZRO4825,the more I learn the more awed I am by the stuff you guys do
15-12-2017T18:38:38,ZRO4825,"Freaking Skidd, dude doesn't even sketch, just goes into lines. That floored me watching him during commisions. o.o;"
15-12-2017T18:39:21,SageSaga,that's nothing more than a trick and a bad one at that tbh
15-12-2017T18:39:54,ZRO4825,Oh?
15-12-2017T18:41:30,SageSaga,it's an old caricature artist technique
15-12-2017T18:41:47,ZRO4825,ahhh
15-12-2017T18:41:53,SageSaga,the trick is to over exaggerate things to draw attention away from the flaws
15-12-2017T18:42:10,SageSaga,and do it very fast - it looks neat- but it has a lot of weaknesses
15-12-2017T18:42:42,SageSaga,its mostly to look cool- like you are so professional you dont even need to sketch- but thats a recipe for disaster
15-12-2017T18:43:21,ZRO4825,Makes sense
15-12-2017T18:43:42,SageSaga,"for Comics Consistency is very important and if you just go willy nilly with your lines you probably wont even notice when an eye is too big, a head is too thick, etc etc"
15-12-2017T18:44:02,ZRO4825,Makes sense
15-12-2017T18:44:06,ZRO4825,...I say that too much
15-12-2017T18:45:17,SageSaga,its one of the reason i do the coloring on a separate day
15-12-2017T18:45:31,SageSaga,you might see me occasionally fixing line work while coloring
15-12-2017T18:46:59,SageSaga,its also why Tom puts so much work into his sketches
15-12-2017T18:47:37,TheBeckoner,hello people
15-12-2017T18:48:26,SageSaga,yo
15-12-2017T18:49:24,TheBeckoner,How has everyone's day gone so far?
15-12-2017T18:51:16,TheBeckoner,I just made a grilled cheese sandwich

15-12-2017T18:51:51,ZRO4825,"I just tried to scroll the comic down on my screen....again, lol"
15-12-2017T18:52:17,TheBeckoner,I do that a lot when Tom is drawing and I wanna see something else lol
15-12-2017T18:52:34,TheBeckoner,then I get frustrated when it doesn't work
15-12-2017T18:52:38,ZRO4825,I do it with both Tom and Sage a lot XD
15-12-2017T18:55:42,ZRO4825,"G-pen there. Just a different color, or another layer effect?"

15-12-2017T19:00:56,nekoanon,:ctwokinds-reniderp_flip::ctwokinds-daydreamingkat::ctwokinds-reniderp:

15-12-2017T19:03:41,TheBeckoner,Tom is a crazy lurker person too?
15-12-2017T19:04:25,Twokinds,Uh... I don't have a PS4

15-12-2017T19:06:27,ZRO4825,"Since it'll be on PC, good chance I'll pick this one up"
15-12-2017T19:06:48,ZRO4825,"Well, I should say, since it's not going to be on a handheld. I rarely touch my 3DS anymore..."
15-12-2017T19:07:01,ZRO4825,"'course, part of that is the direction circle pad is sticking constantly now days..."
15-12-2017T19:07:13,ZRO4825,Makes it a bit of a pain to fight with at times
15-12-2017T19:07:20,TheBeckoner,If I pick up a handheld its usually to play tetris
15-12-2017T19:08:29,TheBeckoner,"people keep talking about this monster hunter game, so i guess i'll have to check it out"
15-12-2017T19:13:11,Bgrmystr2,I'm not too bothered with it lol
15-12-2017T19:16:06,SageSaga,do you have a PS4?
