12-11-2017T00:10:59,Bgrmystr2,Lol yeah stream is way over
12-11-2017T00:11:07,Bgrmystr2,"I'm late, but whatever :v"
12-11-2017T00:54:16,Twokinds,I'm still drawing. Just not streaming.
12-11-2017T00:55:43,unsteddyphoenix,"Oh? Doing another sketch, or something else?"
12-11-2017T01:00:30,BluePhantom90,well gtg. but hope to see more sketches Tom. but night all
12-11-2017T01:10:08,Twokinds,I am converting all the old files into book files
12-11-2017T01:10:13,Twokinds,For Book 4
12-11-2017T01:11:39,Twokinds,It's a lot of work.
12-11-2017T01:11:43,iliar,You redraw some pages or just converting?
12-11-2017T01:11:43,Kinipshun,ooooh
12-11-2017T01:12:06,Kinipshun,i really want to buy the books
12-11-2017T01:12:23,Twokinds,"No redrawing for the most part, but a lot of upscaling, a lot of redoing of text and speech bubbles"
12-11-2017T01:12:39,Twokinds,Some backgrounds are improved.
12-11-2017T01:12:48,unsteddyphoenix,"It's correctly formatted for book form already, right?"
12-11-2017T01:12:49,Kinipshun,what resolution do you use for the books?
12-11-2017T01:13:20,Twokinds,300dpi
12-11-2017T01:13:34,Twokinds,"What do you mean, what is corrected formatted for book form already?"
12-11-2017T01:13:51,Twokinds,The old files unfortunately for a long time were 200dpi.
12-11-2017T01:13:59,Twokinds,So I have a lot of work.
12-11-2017T01:14:06,Kinipshun,is that waht it is on keenspot?
12-11-2017T01:14:48,Twokinds,I don't know what you mean.
12-11-2017T01:15:03,Twokinds,Yes?
12-11-2017T01:15:30,Kinipshun,i mean is that the dpi for the comic on keenspot or the books printed in the past?
12-11-2017T01:15:46,Twokinds,It's my files.
12-11-2017T01:15:50,Twokinds,My original photoshop files.
12-11-2017T01:15:55,Kinipshun,oh
12-11-2017T01:15:56,Kinipshun,OH
12-11-2017T01:18:04,unsteddyphoenix,"Hm, nvm, ignore me. More importantly, how much have you converted so far?"
12-11-2017T01:19:42,iliar,About upscaling. Do you know about waifu2x? This program gives a better result than Photoshop.
12-11-2017T01:23:28,Twokinds,I am on Page Natani-gets-thrown-into-a-wall
12-11-2017T01:23:47,Twokinds,"And yes, I do know about waifu2x, but that is not how I am upscaling."
12-11-2017T01:24:15,Kinipshun,"that's what i use, but yeah i dont blame you; it's far from perfect"
12-11-2017T01:24:45,unsteddyphoenix,Ahh. Musclebro 'bout to blow up :(
12-11-2017T01:25:12,Twokinds,"Since I have layers, it is more effective for me to upscale them and then modify the linart seperately."
12-11-2017T01:27:27,Bgrmystr2,"wait, you know what page that is, phoenix?"
12-11-2017T01:27:49,Twokinds,"Did you know that in one version of the script, he did not blow up?"
12-11-2017T01:28:14,Twokinds,He actually becomes so flustered that he steps backwards and falls down the bridge cliff.
12-11-2017T01:28:14,Kinipshun,i did not
12-11-2017T01:28:29,unsteddyphoenix,LOL
12-11-2017T01:28:43,unsteddyphoenix,I knew that Natani and Flora defeated him with nudity in another version
12-11-2017T01:28:51,unsteddyphoenix,I DIDNT know he died as a result.
12-11-2017T01:29:05,unsteddyphoenix,I can see why you didn't go for that.
12-11-2017T01:29:17,Kinipshun,that'd be a great way to go
12-11-2017T01:29:23,Kinipshun,dying of nudity
12-11-2017T01:29:30,Twokinds,"He doesn't. He just is presumed dead, and after the chapter is over there's a page of him climbing out of the canyon."
12-11-2017T01:29:58,unsteddyphoenix,"Ahh, I see."
12-11-2017T01:30:05,Twokinds,"""I'm not dead!"""
12-11-2017T01:30:37,Twokinds,"But yeah, defeat by nudity was a little too silly"
12-11-2017T01:30:47,Twokinds,Although it would be funny
12-11-2017T01:31:26,unsteddyphoenix,"Plus if you did that, I bet some people would think Alaric lived somehow."
12-11-2017T01:31:39,Kinipshun,lol yes
12-11-2017T01:31:40,unsteddyphoenix,"""If HE fell off a cliff and lived, then SURELY..."""
12-11-2017T01:31:47,Kinipshun,XD
12-11-2017T01:32:24,Twokinds,"Well no, he's only come out of the canyon after they sailed away."
12-11-2017T01:32:31,Twokinds,Like a comically long time later.
12-11-2017T01:32:43,Twokinds,Just took so long to climb back up.
12-11-2017T01:32:58,unsteddyphoenix,Hahaha
12-11-2017T01:33:01,unsteddyphoenix,I can imagine that
12-11-2017T01:33:35,unsteddyphoenix,And some say...Alaric is still climbing...
12-11-2017T01:33:57,Kinipshun,still to this day
12-11-2017T01:34:45,unsteddyphoenix,Who would win: The strongest (male)general in the entire basitin isles VS a pair of panties.
12-11-2017T01:35:21,Kinipshun,no... ankle coverings placed suspiciously on the floor
12-11-2017T01:39:11,Kinipshun,killed unsteddy with such lewd talk
12-11-2017T01:41:50,Kinipshun,anyway im gonna get to bed. gn unsteddy and tom
12-11-2017T01:42:20,unsteddyphoenix,later
12-11-2017T01:58:01,MekalBoy,You guys are still on?
12-11-2017T01:59:08,Twokinds,No
12-11-2017T02:01:02,MekalBoy,It's been like 10 hours
12-11-2017T02:03:51,unsteddyphoenix,what are you the TIME police?
12-11-2017T02:03:56,MekalBoy,No
12-11-2017T02:04:12,MekalBoy,"I am your boy, Mekal, who just woke up"
12-11-2017T02:38:07,Dadrobit,So ded
12-11-2017T02:40:37,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-flomad:
12-11-2017T02:42:54,Dadrobit,You 'n yer fancy emotes.
12-11-2017T02:44:34,BadFoMo,Crap. What all of the chat did I miss (and is anyone willing to send what I missed to me)?
12-11-2017T02:46:57,Twokinds,"You missed everything. So much lore, lost to the ages."
12-11-2017T02:47:11,BadFoMo,CRAP!
12-11-2017T02:47:35,BadFoMo,I am sad now.
12-11-2017T02:49:21,Twokinds,Heheh
12-11-2017T02:49:26,Twokinds,I am joking.
12-11-2017T02:50:04,Twokinds,I think all talked about was how the Musclehead General was once gunna fall to his doom rather than explode.
12-11-2017T02:51:00,Dadrobit,And comic dpi and upscaling techniques. But that's about it.
12-11-2017T02:51:53,BadFoMo,"Thanks, I am less sad now."
12-11-2017T02:52:49,BadFoMo,So what was the reason for the change?
12-11-2017T02:52:50,Dadrobit,Just got a cherry-mango monster icepop. I too am less sad now.
12-11-2017T02:53:37,Dadrobit,It was too silly
12-11-2017T02:57:02,Twokinds,Sleep time for me.
12-11-2017T02:57:49,Dadrobit,"Have a good one, Tom."
12-11-2017T02:58:15,iliar,"Good night, Tom."
12-11-2017T02:58:17,BadFoMo,Good night.
