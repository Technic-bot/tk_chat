27-10-2017T00:00:25,ZRO4825,must figure out what to do for sketch o.o
27-10-2017T00:00:45,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Next month is the month I double in size
27-10-2017T00:00:48,Unenlagia,Kids'll get up to some mischief
27-10-2017T00:00:58,Twokinds,Done
27-10-2017T00:01:01,FoxxTrotter,That...and cats.
27-10-2017T00:01:03,BadFoMo,Cool.
27-10-2017T00:01:05,Sammit,Very nice

27-10-2017T00:01:24,Unenlagia,Excellent
27-10-2017T00:01:25,ZRO4825,"But, you can't do that Marv. If you double in size, you'll no longer be the Hug Pharaoh. You'll then be the ""Sit on People Pharaoh"""
27-10-2017T00:01:36,Ordithus,Maeve has saved the day
27-10-2017T00:01:38,Bgrmystr2,10/10 NOMs

27-10-2017T00:02:12,Bgrmystr2,Thanks for streaming Ron :D
27-10-2017T00:02:15,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Nighty night Ron, thank you for the streamy stream"
27-10-2017T00:02:34,Nekonny,thanks for having me over again

27-10-2017T00:03:37,KHVathiel,"First in one of these streams, and I already like it x3"
27-10-2017T00:03:44,SpotTheLeopard,"Awesome job, all of you guys"
27-10-2017T00:04:05,Mihari,I'm afraid to f5 to get rid of the offline window T_T
27-10-2017T00:04:09,Ordithus,Hmm... I hit refresh.  I regret everything
27-10-2017T00:04:15,Mihari,That's why... XD
27-10-2017T00:04:16,Ordithus,Broken scripts
27-10-2017T00:04:32,ZRO4825,"I was all like ""Oh, need to fix streams *F5* ....WHAT HAVE I DONE???"""
27-10-2017T00:04:44,KHVathiel,What did it do o-o
27-10-2017T00:04:46,BluePhantom90,Oh the Rose one
27-10-2017T00:04:47,w0lfmare,"Oh hey, this is an old page sketch"
27-10-2017T00:05:04,Combak,Night Ron!
27-10-2017T00:05:06,ZRO4825,"Picarto's having issues KhVathiel. So, sometimes...you just get endlessly loading streams"
27-10-2017T00:05:07,Unenlagia,Finally getting some follow through there
27-10-2017T00:05:13,Combak,has been very distracted tonight.
27-10-2017T00:05:15,BadFoMo,"""What has science DOOOOONE?!"""
27-10-2017T00:05:19,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"yep, these nora card holders tend to live in the past"
27-10-2017T00:05:29,Sammit,instead of F5 i duplicate the tab if it loads correctly i close the previous one
27-10-2017T00:05:34,ZRO4825,":thinking: Gee, I wonder why that might be"
27-10-2017T00:05:40,unsteddyphoenix,Oh yeah
27-10-2017T00:05:42,unsteddyphoenix,THIS card lmao
27-10-2017T00:06:00,KHVathiel,"Oh, picarto on desktop crashing huh"
27-10-2017T00:06:13,ZRO4825,"Yeah, it's acting like the phone app now XD"
27-10-2017T00:06:35,KHVathiel,Funny enough the phone app has never given me issues
27-10-2017T00:06:36,Mihari,"If I had a Nora card, I wonder if D&D doodles would count... they did have Flora and Nora..."
27-10-2017T00:06:57,CrimsonHelsing,"Whoa whoa whoa, what is this? O.o"
27-10-2017T00:07:05,MarvTheHugPharaoh,a old page sketch
27-10-2017T00:07:08,KHVathiel,Rather the desktop always makes my laptop bluescreen after a while u less I switch to flash or html4 >. <;
27-10-2017T00:07:12,Combak,"I'd say no, but you are Mihari."
27-10-2017T00:07:15,unsteddyphoenix,It probably would
27-10-2017T00:07:20,Zakuru,WHOA
27-10-2017T00:07:21,Zakuru,WHAT?!
27-10-2017T00:07:22,unsteddyphoenix,It seems like basically anything goes lol
27-10-2017T00:07:33,Zakuru,he's doing this one..!?
27-10-2017T00:07:34,Mihari,"I don't garnish any special treatment from Tom, you should see how he picks on me in D&D XD"
27-10-2017T00:07:35,unsteddyphoenix,Sketch from 2004? Sure. Entire page? You bet.
27-10-2017T00:07:44,MarvTheHugPharaoh,@Zakuru it got nora carded
27-10-2017T00:07:51,unsteddyphoenix,I would like an example please
27-10-2017T00:07:56,Zakuru,wowsers
27-10-2017T00:08:00,unsteddyphoenix,Weave us a tale
27-10-2017T00:08:06,SageSaga,"Tom bought a magic item to basically say ""Haha look at me - im Mihari's character"""
27-10-2017T00:08:12,Bgrmystr2,"well, even the sketches on his deviantart are mostly fair game for the color"
27-10-2017T00:08:14,Zakuru,he's probably only get the line art done tonight
27-10-2017T00:08:18,Mihari,Sage is tho XD
27-10-2017T00:08:22,Bgrmystr2,for nora cards I think
27-10-2017T00:08:26,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
27-10-2017T00:08:48,Bgrmystr2,haha that sounds amazing
27-10-2017T00:08:53,Combak,"Dang it, I refreshed and now the streams won't play. XD"
27-10-2017T00:08:54,Bgrmystr2,suddenly there's two miharis
27-10-2017T00:08:57,BluePhantom90,So Sage when is your birthday?
27-10-2017T00:08:58,KHVathiel,What's a nora card?
27-10-2017T00:09:08,SageSaga,i already said
27-10-2017T00:09:09,Ordithus,WE WARNED YOU
27-10-2017T00:09:14,SageSaga,the 24th of November
27-10-2017T00:09:15,LeKnightWolf,"well am going to sleep now, i'll be back tomorrow. Bye everyone."
27-10-2017T00:09:22,Ordithus,g'night knight
27-10-2017T00:09:23,BluePhantom90,sorry I got like 4 streams going and watching
27-10-2017T00:09:27,FoxxTrotter,"G'night, LeKnight."
27-10-2017T00:09:28,Combak,Night Knight!
27-10-2017T00:09:29,Sammit,bye Knight
27-10-2017T00:09:31,BluePhantom90,Ah
27-10-2017T00:09:43,LemonTheBichir,yup came to check if random streams are loading
27-10-2017T00:09:44,Bgrmystr2,with two miharis it's as if suddenly a thousand voices cried into the night.. and were instantaniously silenced..
27-10-2017T00:09:46,LemonTheBichir,no luck
27-10-2017T00:10:02,BluePhantom90,So just like my mom's Birthday. her birthday is the 24th as well.
27-10-2017T00:10:08,MarvTheHugPharaoh,does a dance because his streams work
27-10-2017T00:10:12,unsteddyphoenix,Coincidence? I think NOT.
27-10-2017T00:10:19,SageSaga,if there were 2 Miharis i would hope they would make out together
27-10-2017T00:10:25,SageSaga,but thats just me... maybe
27-10-2017T00:10:28,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
27-10-2017T00:10:36,FoxxTrotter,Hehe...
27-10-2017T00:10:43,Bgrmystr2,I would be conflicted between recording and
27-10-2017T00:10:45,Bgrmystr2,abandoning ship
27-10-2017T00:11:00,KHVathiel,What could possibly go wrong tho?
27-10-2017T00:11:05,Bgrmystr2,haha
27-10-2017T00:11:10,Mihari,"That would get awkward quick, especially if we both had the same foot injury XD"
27-10-2017T00:11:14,ZRO4825,lmao
27-10-2017T00:11:15,unsteddyphoenix,Get lost in the spots
27-10-2017T00:11:16,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"I will nail gun you too the floor boards bgr, your the camera man you saty"
27-10-2017T00:11:20,MarvTheHugPharaoh,stay even
27-10-2017T00:11:28,Bgrmystr2,Poor KHV lol
27-10-2017T00:11:29,unsteddyphoenix,"It would be mirrored though, so together youd be equally supported."
27-10-2017T00:11:50,Mihari,"So mirrored huh, she'd be dom? Cool!"
27-10-2017T00:11:56,ZRO4825,XD
27-10-2017T00:11:58,Mihari,But that means she'd also be straight T_T
27-10-2017T00:11:59,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
27-10-2017T00:12:00,Mihari,That sucks!
27-10-2017T00:12:08,Bgrmystr2,RIP
27-10-2017T00:12:09,unsteddyphoenix,"Fuck, that is problematic..."
27-10-2017T00:12:14,Combak,I'm learning so much about Mihari right now. XD
27-10-2017T00:12:15,Unenlagia,Raises the age old question; is that incest or masturbation?
27-10-2017T00:12:17,KHVathiel,Why poor me? There's probably some joke I'm not aware of xD
27-10-2017T00:12:23,Mihari,selfcest
27-10-2017T00:12:27,Bgrmystr2,none of this is new though combak lol
27-10-2017T00:12:28,unsteddyphoenix,Is the mirror of bi celibate?
27-10-2017T00:12:32,ZRO4825,That is what it is. Yes.
27-10-2017T00:12:33,Combak,It's new to me!
27-10-2017T00:12:37,KHVathiel,Or twincest if you wanted to be creepy
27-10-2017T00:12:40,SageSaga,if a neutral person comes from the mirror universe- are they any different besides the facial hair?
27-10-2017T00:12:48,unsteddyphoenix,tWINcest
27-10-2017T00:12:52,Bgrmystr2,and yeah with yourself is selfcest
27-10-2017T00:12:57,MarvTheHugPharaoh,II thought it was cannibalism
27-10-2017T00:12:58,ZRO4825,How would you denote neutrality that way though? Half a goatee?
27-10-2017T00:13:01,Unenlagia,makes notes
27-10-2017T00:13:14,Mihari,It's only that if you actually eat someone of the same race.
27-10-2017T00:13:21,Mihari,Eating out doesn't apply.
27-10-2017T00:13:23,BluePhantom90,will do this Sage. When I get my army paycheck I will donate 50 when I become a patron to you. sound good?
27-10-2017T00:13:28,unsteddyphoenix,Phrasing!
27-10-2017T00:13:38,SageSaga,sounds great
27-10-2017T00:13:41,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"if you eat your clone is that cannibalism, or masturbation?"
27-10-2017T00:13:46,ZRO4825,Phrasing was perfect though.
27-10-2017T00:13:49,KHVathiel,O.o
27-10-2017T00:13:55,Mihari,"And this is quickly getting NSFW, Soooooooo... how about them artsies!"
27-10-2017T00:13:58,SageSaga,my brother ate his twin
27-10-2017T00:14:09,Unenlagia,"Wouldn't know, my picarto locked up"
27-10-2017T00:14:12,SageSaga,well absorbed him
27-10-2017T00:14:15,KHVathiel,I am officialy weirded out xD
27-10-2017T00:14:19,Unenlagia,I'm in the loading hole now
27-10-2017T00:14:24,Mihari,So he highlandered him?
27-10-2017T00:14:33,unsteddyphoenix,Never go full highlander
27-10-2017T00:14:35,SageSaga,yeah but all he got was more stupid
27-10-2017T00:14:43,SageSaga,hohoho
27-10-2017T00:14:46,unsteddyphoenix,Looool
27-10-2017T00:14:50,unsteddyphoenix,Roasted and toaste
27-10-2017T00:14:52,MarvTheHugPharaoh,lol
27-10-2017T00:14:54,Unenlagia,Shots fired!
27-10-2017T00:15:32,unsteddyphoenix,Adding a negative number~
27-10-2017T00:15:44,MarvTheHugPharaoh,your crazy
27-10-2017T00:16:04,KHVathiel,"I still don't know what a Nora card is, but is it possible to check out what they are on Tom's DA?"
27-10-2017T00:16:14,FoxxTrotter,His Patreon.
27-10-2017T00:16:19,ZRO4825,It's a rank on his Patreon
27-10-2017T00:16:28,KHVathiel,Ooohhh. Thanks o.o
27-10-2017T00:16:29,MarvTheHugPharaoh,only 4 holders a month
27-10-2017T00:16:59,KHVathiel,Oh so after the month ends it boots the pledge so 4 more can dive in or does he select em?
27-10-2017T00:17:10,ZRO4825,don't think it boots'em
27-10-2017T00:17:13,Bgrmystr2,it doesn't boot them no
27-10-2017T00:17:22,Bgrmystr2,they have to manually remove themselves.
27-10-2017T00:17:36,KHVathiel,"Ah, thanks."
27-10-2017T00:18:03,Twokinds,I priced it so people wouldn't want to sit on it. And I wouldn't have to work as much.
27-10-2017T00:18:15,Twokinds,>_>
27-10-2017T00:18:17,Unenlagia,Very smart
27-10-2017T00:18:21,SageSaga,it hasnt worked
27-10-2017T00:18:29,Bgrmystr2,can agree w/ sage
27-10-2017T00:18:42,Unenlagia,You know what they say about fools and money
27-10-2017T00:18:47,KHVathiel,"Lol, whoops?"
27-10-2017T00:19:01,BluePhantom90,"yeah, people who have the money can sit on the Nora cards as long as they want."
27-10-2017T00:19:02,unsteddyphoenix,Yeaaah~
27-10-2017T00:19:21,SageSaga,i wish i had more fools?
27-10-2017T00:19:30,unsteddyphoenix,"Take it down for a month, then bring it back with increased price?"
27-10-2017T00:19:31,FoxxTrotter,Joker's Wild.
27-10-2017T00:19:36,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"nope your stuck with the smart ones,Sage"
27-10-2017T00:19:38,Twokinds,Nah
27-10-2017T00:19:50,Ordithus,"yay streams back, no more broken scripts"
27-10-2017T00:19:51,Twokinds,I'm pretty sure slots will be open next month
27-10-2017T00:19:52,SageSaga,but my money is really becoming a problem XD
27-10-2017T00:19:54,BluePhantom90,and someone already suspects one of the Nora card holders is Leo
27-10-2017T00:19:55,Bgrmystr2,"that's already a bad idea, phoenix xD"
27-10-2017T00:20:08,unsteddyphoenix,Ohyeah? Some peeps droppin' out?
27-10-2017T00:20:15,unsteddyphoenix,Why is it a bad idea?
27-10-2017T00:20:17,KHVathiel,"I mean if the same few people are able to hold it for months, what's to prevent em from holding the new prices o-o"
27-10-2017T00:20:22,w0lfmare,Aren't you lacking a store Sage?
27-10-2017T00:20:31,unsteddyphoenix,The...increased price...would prevent them in theory
27-10-2017T00:20:39,SageSaga,a store?
27-10-2017T00:20:40,unsteddyphoenix,Unless they have UNLIMITED MONEY
27-10-2017T00:20:42,Bgrmystr2,because increasing prices for the same thing tends to generate problems
27-10-2017T00:20:47,w0lfmare,Why not setup a few print on demand things?
27-10-2017T00:20:58,unsteddyphoenix,Uh.
27-10-2017T00:21:04,Unenlagia,That might have to go through third parties
27-10-2017T00:21:06,SageSaga,i dont think those work very well
27-10-2017T00:21:12,unsteddyphoenix,Alright guys increasing the price of things is problematic
27-10-2017T00:21:15,unsteddyphoenix,Shut down captilisn
27-10-2017T00:21:16,unsteddyphoenix,Its over
27-10-2017T00:21:25,w0lfmare,What about books?
27-10-2017T00:21:34,ZRO4825,Those of us who DO want prints...don't have a lot of spare money running around XD
27-10-2017T00:21:37,Bgrmystr2,"Lol phoenix, it's better to have something too expensive and lower the price than have something too cheap and increase the price"
27-10-2017T00:21:38,SageSaga,it takes years to make a book
27-10-2017T00:21:41,KHVathiel,Prints are the reason I'm broke
27-10-2017T00:22:19,unsteddyphoenix,"Oh, I agree with that. Ship has sailed though."
27-10-2017T00:22:28,unsteddyphoenix,I think I even said that at the time lol
27-10-2017T00:22:41,Unenlagia,Artbooks are niche items anyway
27-10-2017T00:22:42,KHVathiel,The print=broke thing?
27-10-2017T00:22:48,Bgrmystr2,it still applies now though
27-10-2017T00:22:52,ZRO4825,Capitalism is flawed anyway. It's always run by capitalist pigs!
27-10-2017T00:22:53,w0lfmare,It just doesn't seem right to rely on the Patreon income
27-10-2017T00:22:55,SageSaga,ive done an art book
27-10-2017T00:23:03,ZRO4825,I have that book. <3
27-10-2017T00:23:04,Unenlagia,A print can be framed and hung on a wall. Not so with an entire book unless you take a blade to it.
27-10-2017T00:23:09,unsteddyphoenix,Why not w0lf?
27-10-2017T00:23:10,Mihari,"Exclusive prints sometimes work, IE cons and such, but beyond that, print on demand are very lackluster and random."
27-10-2017T00:23:12,SageSaga,AI will be a comic book that will be self published- but it takes time
27-10-2017T00:23:17,KHVathiel,Well it seems to work so people keep using it
27-10-2017T00:23:21,w0lfmare,Not that there's anything wrong with Patreon income
27-10-2017T00:23:32,Unenlagia,Con swag are big ticket items
27-10-2017T00:23:55,Bgrmystr2,"lol w0lf, it's not really different.. being paid by a company to provide a service to people.. and people pay the company"
27-10-2017T00:24:00,KHVathiel,And yeah. I know for a fact unless I like a particular character in a print I probs will ignore it
27-10-2017T00:24:05,Bgrmystr2,"Patreon cuts out the middleman, being the company itself."
27-10-2017T00:24:11,ZRO4825,sort of...
27-10-2017T00:24:15,Ordithus,Patreon is the middle man though
27-10-2017T00:24:30,Unenlagia,^
27-10-2017T00:24:36,Bgrmystr2,"not exactly, people pay you, and patreon takes part of the profit to fund the site"
27-10-2017T00:24:49,Ordithus,"A helpful middle man, perhaps."
27-10-2017T00:24:51,Bgrmystr2,"it's not the same as people paying patreon, and patreon paying you as an employee"
27-10-2017T00:24:55,KHVathiel,"It's just meant for these sorts of things, unlike paypal which while reliable is for direct purposes in a"
27-10-2017T00:25:08,KHVathiel,nything. Why did my message cut..
27-10-2017T00:25:12,ZRO4825,Paypal is also risky in the case of some artists
27-10-2017T00:25:13,unsteddyphoenix,Paypal isnt that reliable ive heard
27-10-2017T00:25:16,w0lfmare,A more passive source of income would be handy though
27-10-2017T00:25:35,KHVathiel,No paypal is really is not.
27-10-2017T00:25:44,unsteddyphoenix,More passive than automatic monthly payments?
27-10-2017T00:26:05,SageSaga,also - Patreon is supporting the work im already doing- which is a lot
27-10-2017T00:26:10,ZRO4825,"Like, if you're a NSFW artist, and Paypal decides that they suddenly don't wanna be associated with your NSFW-ness, then they can cut you off completely."
27-10-2017T00:26:36,Bgrmystr2,yeh paypal is kinda shitty like that
27-10-2017T00:26:41,ZRO4825,I've heard of them doing that before with artists
27-10-2017T00:26:56,Zakuru,ITS MOVING
27-10-2017T00:26:57,Zakuru,YAS
27-10-2017T00:27:00,Combak,"... Finally, I can see the stream again!"
27-10-2017T00:27:07,Unenlagia,"In that case you'd have to go to other sites, ones that cater to the clientele. Though that's also risky."
27-10-2017T00:27:13,Mihari,Sage go check your mail
27-10-2017T00:27:15,w0lfmare,Well the patreon campaign is supporting the comics (A huge ammount of work for Yosh and AI) and the commissions are a drawing for a fee
27-10-2017T00:27:37,unsteddyphoenix,Technically patreon is just about supporting creators
27-10-2017T00:27:47,unsteddyphoenix,"Out of curiosity, are the people who are having trouble with the stream using firefox?"
27-10-2017T00:27:57,w0lfmare,"That's a lot of work, I wouldn't call it passive income"
27-10-2017T00:27:58,Unenlagia,Not just firefox
27-10-2017T00:27:59,Bgrmystr2,"honestly, paypal isn't that bad if you only use them as a setup to transfer money. As long as it's a simple ""Payment for services"" and that's it, they've got nothing"
27-10-2017T00:28:00,Ordithus,I WAS having trouble both FF and Edge.
27-10-2017T00:28:09,ZRO4825,"It fixed a short bit ago, but yeah, I'm on Chrome and was having trouble."
27-10-2017T00:28:13,Ordithus,Now both work fine.
27-10-2017T00:28:30,unsteddyphoenix,I see. dude I know was only havin trouble with FF
27-10-2017T00:28:32,Ordithus,NoScript was showing some weird script sources
27-10-2017T00:28:46,w0lfmare,"Having something for sale somewhere would be an easier source of income, without adding more long term commitment"
27-10-2017T00:28:59,Bgrmystr2,I was getting the same result using OBS's browser source too
27-10-2017T00:29:01,Ordithus,https (insert characters here) 2-full
27-10-2017T00:29:07,Ordithus,never seen that before
27-10-2017T00:29:12,Bgrmystr2,I don't know what it uses though..
27-10-2017T00:29:22,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah, fair enough, I can understand that."
27-10-2017T00:29:32,w0lfmare,"Even if you didn't make a lot, it would be something to help"
27-10-2017T00:29:38,Unenlagia,That's very weird
27-10-2017T00:29:58,Ordithus,I think someone did a goof
27-10-2017T00:30:09,Bgrmystr2,"probably, Ord"
27-10-2017T00:30:13,unsteddyphoenix,"THey wont always sell though, that money is temporary"
27-10-2017T00:30:18,SageSaga,just gonna put this out there- If you like my work and you want to support me but dont like patreon or dont want to subscribe to something long term - i do take commissions  i just dont often go around asking if people want them- so just ask any time and
27-10-2017T00:30:24,SageSaga,i'll work it into my schedule
27-10-2017T00:30:34,ZRO4825,"can attest, did ask, did get~ <3"
27-10-2017T00:30:38,Mihari,They do happen... eventually :P
27-10-2017T00:30:41,KHVathiel,All I definitely know is that when patreon happened people rejoiced and said they had something better than paypal
27-10-2017T00:30:59,SageSaga,some take longer i admit- for example this month all the people wanted Halloween pictures-
27-10-2017T00:31:04,FoxxTrotter,"I'm off to bed. I have another early day ahead. Sage, Tom...thanks for the streams. G'night, all. :0)"
27-10-2017T00:31:09,SageSaga,so this has been a super busy month
27-10-2017T00:31:14,ZRO4825,Not me. Screw holidays! :P
27-10-2017T00:31:16,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nighty Night Foxx
27-10-2017T00:31:24,ZRO4825,'cept birthday. Birthday is a good holiday. =D
27-10-2017T00:31:26,Sammit,bye Foxx
27-10-2017T00:31:30,Mihari,Clearly all the people XD
27-10-2017T00:31:37,ZRO4825,:P
27-10-2017T00:31:40,SageSaga,Mihari's picture will be done in a week or so - might even do it during the next stream
27-10-2017T00:31:46,Bgrmystr2,"Paypal isn't the same as patreon though, so it's not like a replacement lol"
27-10-2017T00:31:49,SageSaga,all the patreon requests i mean
27-10-2017T00:32:18,Mihari,"Eh, wouldn't use patreon when I can just pay direct."
27-10-2017T00:32:23,SageSaga,normally the color requests are 2 per month- this time its 4
27-10-2017T00:32:28,Mihari,Besides direct doesn't come with limitations :P
27-10-2017T00:32:37,ZRO4825,2 per month normally? O_o
27-10-2017T00:32:46,ZRO4825,but...4 slots?
27-10-2017T00:32:54,ZRO4825,just got a confused.
27-10-2017T00:33:01,Mihari,Some people double and save it so they can get two characters.
27-10-2017T00:33:02,SageSaga,yeah the color commissions usually do 2 character commissions which is basically like saving a month
27-10-2017T00:33:50,SageSaga,so usually i end up doing 2 2-characters each month- sometimes 1 single character and 1 dual character
27-10-2017T00:34:11,SageSaga,and they usually swap around like that- so i usually dont have to do 4 in one month
27-10-2017T00:34:18,Mihari,I shall get a 5 character one!
27-10-2017T00:34:20,Mihari,cackles!
27-10-2017T00:34:29,SageSaga,heck even when they do i usually sketch one the month before so its easier to ink and color the next month
27-10-2017T00:35:31,Ordithus,that's not procrastinating!
27-10-2017T00:35:52,SageSaga,i dont generally procrastinate that much
27-10-2017T00:36:07,SageSaga,i generally dont have time to do that
27-10-2017T00:36:21,Ordithus,You're too good for us
27-10-2017T00:36:24,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
27-10-2017T00:37:09,SageSaga,i do 4 comics a week
27-10-2017T00:37:23,KHVathiel,Damn that's a lot o-o
27-10-2017T00:37:48,ZRO4825,Thus why his sketch/color slots via patreon are as limited as they are.
27-10-2017T00:38:07,ZRO4825,"Tom (typically) only does one comic page a week, so he ends up with more time for the sketch streams and such. Usually."
27-10-2017T00:38:19,SageSaga,if i didnt do so many i would double my color commission slots XD
27-10-2017T00:38:49,Ordithus,Tom often gets 2 comics in a week.  Or he goes 2 months without to make a side comic!
27-10-2017T00:39:25,SageSaga,i started making comics shortly after Tom - my comic is hitting 2000 pages next month
27-10-2017T00:39:37,ZRO4825,"Much as I hate to actually even suggest it, have you thought perhaps of dropping a day off of Yosh! perhaps?"
27-10-2017T00:39:42,Unenlagia,claps
27-10-2017T00:40:00,SageSaga,ive thought about it but i need AI to catch on more before i risk that
27-10-2017T00:40:19,ZRO4825,Understandable.
27-10-2017T00:40:43,unsteddyphoenix,"Hopefully it does, id like to see it updated more"
27-10-2017T00:40:52,unsteddyphoenix,2-2 would be ideal
27-10-2017T00:42:25,Ordithus,is this AI you are drawing now?
27-10-2017T00:42:30,ZRO4825,Yesh!
27-10-2017T00:42:34,Ordithus,I see ears!
27-10-2017T00:42:41,ZRO4825,"....that's a legit Yesh!, not a misspelling of Yosh!"
27-10-2017T00:43:17,Unenlagia,Totally a misspelling of Yosh!
27-10-2017T00:43:29,unsteddyphoenix,Exposed!
27-10-2017T00:43:45,ZRO4825,"Well, I mean, it IS....but it was intentional"
27-10-2017T00:43:47,Bgrmystr2,Yush!

27-10-2017T00:44:52,Unenlagia,Yis
27-10-2017T00:45:30,KHVathiel,My god trying to log into old accounts you forgot you had is horrid ;_;
27-10-2017T00:45:53,Zakuru,yeah
27-10-2017T00:46:25,KHVathiel,That and ones you made at 13 14
27-10-2017T00:47:29,Ordithus,"Hey Tom, is Saria something like 14 in this?"
27-10-2017T00:47:55,unsteddyphoenix,Saria!?
27-10-2017T00:48:04,Ordithus,The one with the hair
27-10-2017T00:48:11,MarvTheHugPharaoh,they all have hair
27-10-2017T00:48:16,Ordithus,and eyes
27-10-2017T00:48:20,MarvTheHugPharaoh,yep
27-10-2017T00:48:35,KHVathiel,Lewl
27-10-2017T00:48:37,unsteddyphoenix,I...would be suprised if she was 14 here
27-10-2017T00:48:38,Ordithus,No triangles
27-10-2017T00:48:59,MarvTheHugPharaoh,you got something against triangles?
27-10-2017T00:49:07,Bgrmystr2,they're not blue enough
27-10-2017T00:49:19,Ordithus,"Yeah, the fact that everyone seems to not know they've got one"
27-10-2017T00:49:57,MarvTheHugPharaoh,they got em at best buy
27-10-2017T00:50:04,Ordithus,So Saria died around 4 years ago... ish... at 28
27-10-2017T00:50:17,Ordithus,"Raine is 18, and this should be before she was born, right?"
27-10-2017T00:50:37,w0lfmare,Wrong
27-10-2017T00:50:44,w0lfmare,:cw0lfmare-HeadEmber:
27-10-2017T00:50:45,Ordithus,Left?
27-10-2017T00:50:46,MarvTheHugPharaoh,lol
27-10-2017T00:50:56,CrimsonHelsing,Wait a minute... a mask had a similar fake human face like that before...
27-10-2017T00:51:03,MarvTheHugPharaoh,educate him W0lfy!
27-10-2017T00:51:41,CrimsonHelsing,It can't be the same mask... can it? O.o;
27-10-2017T00:52:26,Twokinds,No this is the real version of that person
27-10-2017T00:52:31,w0lfmare,"Raine is older than Natani, and Natani is in this bit"
27-10-2017T00:52:48,CrimsonHelsing,Whoever it was
27-10-2017T00:52:51,Unenlagia,This is how Rose and Saria met
27-10-2017T00:52:56,Ordithus,"So 4 years ago, Saria was alive and 28, Raine was 14.  Ergo, Saria being 14ish here, if this is before Raine was born (Mary kicking Euchre out)"
27-10-2017T00:52:58,MarvTheHugPharaoh,is that Sif from DS1 sage?
27-10-2017T00:53:00,unsteddyphoenix,The real fake perosn
27-10-2017T00:53:05,Twokinds,"Also, Crimson"
27-10-2017T00:53:20,Twokinds,You should resubmit your color votes
27-10-2017T00:53:30,Twokinds,You voted in the first 5 minutes and it was lost
27-10-2017T00:53:31,CrimsonHelsing,Oh? Why?
27-10-2017T00:53:36,SageSaga,why would i have a Dark Souls character in my comic?
27-10-2017T00:53:40,Ordithus,w0lf... you...
27-10-2017T00:53:44,MarvTheHugPharaoh,why not?
27-10-2017T00:53:47,Ordithus,lol

27-10-2017T00:53:56,unsteddyphoenix,w0lf how dare you make so much sense
27-10-2017T00:54:00,SageSaga,Copyright claims for one?
27-10-2017T00:54:07,MarvTheHugPharaoh,darn
27-10-2017T00:54:43,CrimsonHelsing,"Pff, okay I'll have a look"

27-10-2017T00:56:09,unsteddyphoenix,Was it?
27-10-2017T00:56:18,Twokinds,I don't know
27-10-2017T00:56:21,unsteddyphoenix,Would be pretty hard to fit in seems like
27-10-2017T00:56:22,Twokinds,I don't remember drawing this at all.
27-10-2017T00:56:27,Bgrmystr2,What comic page is on the left side?
27-10-2017T00:56:31,unsteddyphoenix,"Lol, wow."
27-10-2017T00:56:47,Ordithus,Huh
27-10-2017T00:56:48,unsteddyphoenix,I suppose it makes sense to lose track

27-10-2017T00:57:01,BluePhantom90,lol you don't remember drawing this.
27-10-2017T00:57:05,unsteddyphoenix,Oh yo it even includes background templars huh
27-10-2017T00:57:15,CrimsonHelsing,"@Twokinds Okay, I resubmitted, noticed a few sketches that we're missing I think the first time around. Memory could be playing tricks on me but idk"
27-10-2017T00:57:16,Ordithus,Maybe... you didn't draw this.
27-10-2017T00:57:33,unsteddyphoenix,No that's right Crimson
27-10-2017T00:57:36,unsteddyphoenix,THat's why the remake
27-10-2017T00:57:37,Ordithus,Mabye... it was your evil twin.

27-10-2017T00:57:48,unsteddyphoenix,No they would all have goatees if it was him
27-10-2017T00:58:05,Ordithus,Keith has a goatee in the latest page...
27-10-2017T00:58:14,Ordithus,Is this Tom the evil twin?!
27-10-2017T00:58:36,CrimsonHelsing,"Wait a minute, two of them, just like the fakes... O.O"

27-10-2017T01:00:07,Bgrmystr2,Still don't recall where they were
27-10-2017T01:00:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,they were before the mask part
27-10-2017T01:00:30,CrimsonHelsing,A resistance that didn't get off the ground because the would have been leader was killed by a poison arrow...
27-10-2017T01:02:35,SageSaga,i gotta take a short break- should i turn on the break image?

27-10-2017T01:03:49,Dadrobit,Here we go? But I just got here!
27-10-2017T01:03:52,CrimsonHelsing,Pulling strings from the shadows... it definitely sounds like something a mask would do. And it's starting to make sense now

27-10-2017T01:06:02,BadFoMo,What did Sage do?
27-10-2017T01:06:27,BadFoMo,"Also, I'm back from watching Archer."
27-10-2017T01:06:49,Dadrobit,wb
27-10-2017T01:06:59,unsteddyphoenix,Are they still doing phrasing?
27-10-2017T01:07:07,MarvTheHugPharaoh,no
27-10-2017T01:07:16,unsteddyphoenix,Wow so theyre just not doing phrasing anymore?
27-10-2017T01:07:17,Zakuru,what is this doing here...
27-10-2017T01:07:24,unsteddyphoenix,I need to get back on that shit tho
27-10-2017T01:07:26,CrimsonHelsing,@Twokinds Any slight way these Masks are inspired by the God Hands in Berserk? Even just one of them? O.O
27-10-2017T01:07:42,Twokinds,I've never seen Berserk
27-10-2017T01:07:43,unsteddyphoenix,You think Tom is a filthy weeb?
27-10-2017T01:07:51,MarvTheHugPharaoh,reed berserk Tom
27-10-2017T01:07:56,MarvTheHugPharaoh,read even
27-10-2017T01:08:10,Dadrobit,That's one of those Chinese cartoons right?
27-10-2017T01:08:24,CrimsonHelsing,Japanese manga comic Dadrobit
27-10-2017T01:08:26,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah the ones with the waifis and sunders
27-10-2017T01:08:33,CrimsonHelsing,Been ongoing since the 80s
27-10-2017T01:08:45,Ordithus,*wifi
27-10-2017T01:08:46,Unenlagia,The most recent Berserk anime is atrocious.
27-10-2017T01:08:48,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"its brutal, while give you night terrors,  and get you kicked out of church, but damn its goos"
27-10-2017T01:08:50,MarvTheHugPharaoh,good
27-10-2017T01:09:09,SageSaga,Berserk is amazing
27-10-2017T01:09:10,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah it's pretty good. Updates at like Prequel tier speed though
27-10-2017T01:09:20,CrimsonHelsing,"Really good, yes, pretty dark, yes, very interesting hell yes!"
27-10-2017T01:09:37,MarvTheHugPharaoh,still on hiatus too
27-10-2017T01:09:42,Unenlagia,God I hate Prequel now
27-10-2017T01:09:52,Twokinds,Not really a fan of anything gritty
27-10-2017T01:09:59,SageSaga,its worth it Tom
27-10-2017T01:10:04,MarvTheHugPharaoh,^
27-10-2017T01:10:06,Kamaro12,"wait, berserk is still going?"
27-10-2017T01:10:08,w0lfmare,I'm still trying to figure out where the money for Trace's estate came from
27-10-2017T01:10:09,MarvTheHugPharaoh,da
27-10-2017T01:10:17,Kamaro12,when did it start?
27-10-2017T01:10:21,Unenlagia,The dark shit is contrasted well
27-10-2017T01:10:22,Bgrmystr2,"government, w0lf"
27-10-2017T01:10:23,Dadrobit,Nora financed him.
27-10-2017T01:10:24,Twokinds,taxes
27-10-2017T01:10:27,unsteddyphoenix,"It's VERY far beyond gritty, so might not be worth it"
27-10-2017T01:10:30,MarvTheHugPharaoh,1989 Kam
27-10-2017T01:10:35,Kamaro12,jesus christ
27-10-2017T01:10:52,SageSaga,"I know Tom pretty well, I think he would enjoy it"
27-10-2017T01:10:55,Kamaro12,"if something's been going on for THAT long, then I'm not sure about the quality"
27-10-2017T01:10:57,unsteddyphoenix,Templar just...stole the kings taxes?
27-10-2017T01:11:00,Ordithus,It's good to be the autocratic overlord
27-10-2017T01:11:08,Kamaro12,there's only so much you can put a protagonist through
27-10-2017T01:11:09,BadFoMo,@w0lfmare Stole form the Templar?
27-10-2017T01:11:11,unsteddyphoenix,"Or, they must get a huge stipend"
27-10-2017T01:11:35,Kamaro12,I guess I can't say for sure since I haven't seen it
27-10-2017T01:11:51,SageSaga,or hes a Lord and gets all the taxes from his land and sends some to the king
27-10-2017T01:11:52,Kamaro12,but almost 30 years? Jeez
27-10-2017T01:11:54,unsteddyphoenix,It updates super slow though Kam
27-10-2017T01:12:02,Kamaro12,fair enough
27-10-2017T01:12:08,Kamaro12,"but still, that's a lot of story"
27-10-2017T01:12:10,Ordithus,Duke
27-10-2017T01:12:36,unsteddyphoenix,It is. I agree that all of it is good though
27-10-2017T01:12:43,w0lfmare,"Well I'd have to fact check again, but I think Saria was still alive when he owned the estate, so he wasn't evil yet"
27-10-2017T01:13:08,SageSaga,maybe he was never evil
27-10-2017T01:13:18,unsteddyphoenix,It's all a huge conspiracy
27-10-2017T01:13:21,Dadrobit,He was always a dick tho
27-10-2017T01:13:22,SageSaga,maybe all that evil stuff they think he did was because he was possessed
27-10-2017T01:13:46,unsteddyphoenix,Or maybe the templar spread propaganda about him
27-10-2017T01:14:15,unsteddyphoenix,They prolly control all the information output
27-10-2017T01:14:18,Twokinds,Trace did nothing wrong.
27-10-2017T01:14:19,Kamaro12,maybe it's all in flora's mind because she's in a coma while going crazy :U
27-10-2017T01:14:24,unsteddyphoenix,Big same
27-10-2017T01:14:33,unsteddyphoenix,The keidran figures are all lies!
27-10-2017T01:14:36,Bgrmystr2,rofl Kam xD
27-10-2017T01:14:38,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Trace and Griffith did nothing wrong
27-10-2017T01:14:42,Ordithus,He estabilished several important infrastructure projects!
27-10-2017T01:14:47,Bgrmystr2,"""Did nothing wrong"" yeah ok"
27-10-2017T01:14:48,SageSaga,Griffith raped
27-10-2017T01:14:51,BadFoMo,Maybe the Trace we're following is an imposter.
27-10-2017T01:14:54,MarvTheHugPharaoh,that was femto
27-10-2017T01:14:55,Mihari,"G'night everyone, thanks Sage and Tom for the streams, take care and have a good evening or whenever it is wherever you are."
27-10-2017T01:15:02,Serpentfrog,But he also saved.
27-10-2017T01:15:04,Dadrobit,Cya Mihari
27-10-2017T01:15:05,unsteddyphoenix,Gnight~
27-10-2017T01:15:10,SageSaga,Griffith Raped a girl before he turned into Femto ty
27-10-2017T01:15:11,Kamaro12,"I'd make a joke about Trace and Hitler, but I don't know if I want to go THAT far"
27-10-2017T01:15:20,Bgrmystr2,gnight Mihari
27-10-2017T01:15:25,unsteddyphoenix,"He attac, he protecc, but most importantly he rape"
27-10-2017T01:15:29,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I have no memory of that Sage
27-10-2017T01:15:31,BadFoMo,Maybe he's a clone?
27-10-2017T01:15:33,CrimsonHelsing,"*After, Sage, not before"
27-10-2017T01:15:41,w0lfmare,Guess the real question I'm coming to is how he became Duke of Edinmire
27-10-2017T01:15:47,unsteddyphoenix,Tom already made that joke Kam lol
27-10-2017T01:15:48,MarvTheHugPharaoh,are you talking about the princess?
27-10-2017T01:15:49,SageSaga,it was before
27-10-2017T01:15:53,SageSaga,yeah
27-10-2017T01:16:16,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Griffith is a prick
27-10-2017T01:16:24,unsteddyphoenix,So was human-keidran relations good pre-trace? Or was it already going downhill
27-10-2017T01:16:28,Ordithus,Maybe he did something really good for Edinmire before he went all crazy?
27-10-2017T01:16:29,SageSaga,he also sacrificed everyone who ever cared about him
27-10-2017T01:16:31,unsteddyphoenix,I forget specificis
27-10-2017T01:16:41,CrimsonHelsing,"I thought he did that after he transformed into Femto, he was Femto when he did that"
27-10-2017T01:16:52,CrimsonHelsing,I saw
27-10-2017T01:16:54,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"too be fair, he got super tortured"
27-10-2017T01:17:03,SageSaga,he wasnt Femto till after he was released from the egg
27-10-2017T01:17:06,unsteddyphoenix,"Did you just ""to be fair"" a rape :thinking:"
27-10-2017T01:17:16,CrimsonHelsing,Ohhh
27-10-2017T01:17:21,CrimsonHelsing,I see now
27-10-2017T01:17:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,not that thats why he got tortured
27-10-2017T01:17:27,Kamaro12,unsteddy: somehow I feel that two different races won't get along well even without a fantasy Hitler making it worse
27-10-2017T01:17:29,SageSaga,he had all those people killed before that and raped the princess before that
27-10-2017T01:17:30,Ordithus,"Sythe I think said things were never really good, but went downhill after Trace took power"
27-10-2017T01:17:48,Kamaro12,who is this Griffith guy we're talking about?
27-10-2017T01:17:49,unsteddyphoenix,"There was definitely a time where they DID get along though, just not sure when that ended."
27-10-2017T01:18:05,BadFoMo,"eyes go dirpy ""The Trace we're following is really Grand Templar Trace's Son who he experamented on!"""
27-10-2017T01:18:07,unsteddyphoenix,Character in beserlk
27-10-2017T01:18:08,Kamaro12,unsteddy: probably sometime after the basitin invasion ended
27-10-2017T01:18:10,MarvTheHugPharaoh,in all honesty  judeau is the true hero of Berserk
27-10-2017T01:18:28,Kamaro12,conflict necessitates cooperation
27-10-2017T01:18:30,unsteddyphoenix,Since the humans saved the keidrans asses it'd have to be lol. But that's a long time.
27-10-2017T01:18:37,Kamaro12,"but after you take that out, well..."
27-10-2017T01:18:39,SageSaga,"Griffith is the shining prince, the white hawk, the guy who raped and people said did nothing wrong- those people are wrong"
27-10-2017T01:18:42,BadFoMo,Just like Jake from Bioshock!
27-10-2017T01:18:45,Kamaro12,crimson: thanks
27-10-2017T01:18:49,BadFoMo,*Jack
27-10-2017T01:19:01,Ordithus,It would be a shame if Rose had to sneeze then and there
27-10-2017T01:19:02,Kamaro12,rabit: naaaah
27-10-2017T01:19:06,Kamaro12,robit*
27-10-2017T01:19:15,MarvTheHugPharaoh,dadrabit
27-10-2017T01:19:17,SageSaga,also Femto is still Griffith- why else would he be so obsessed with Guts?
27-10-2017T01:19:20,Dadrobit,No.
27-10-2017T01:19:50,unsteddyphoenix,Griffiths personality is too huge to be deleted by something as insignificant as ascending to godhood
27-10-2017T01:19:55,SageSaga,he did her while looking right at Guts for a reason- he was also aborting their child- hes messed up - dont care if he was part demon
27-10-2017T01:19:56,unsteddyphoenix,It's defintely still him
27-10-2017T01:20:02,Keklilyrandoms,meow
27-10-2017T01:20:11,Kamaro12,"uh, wow"
27-10-2017T01:20:13,CrimsonHelsing,"As far as I'm concerned, the eclipse is the day the hero known as Griffith died"
27-10-2017T01:20:22,SageSaga,yeah - Griffith is messed up
27-10-2017T01:20:30,Kamaro12,"I guess given the background story of Guts's that I've heard, I should expect shit like that to happen in that anime"
27-10-2017T01:20:44,CrimsonHelsing,manga
27-10-2017T01:20:45,SageSaga,the day Guts left him and he lost a sword fight was the day Griffith the hero died
27-10-2017T01:20:51,unsteddyphoenix,The point is that Griffith was always that person. He was ALWAYS prepared to do ANYTHING.
27-10-2017T01:21:04,MarvTheHugPharaoh,and Griffith's pride
27-10-2017T01:21:32,SageSaga,Griffith was building an army of bodies to climb his way to the top from childhood
27-10-2017T01:21:37,Kamaro12,"I do like it when a fantasy setting takes on a gritty approach, but you do need some levity to balance it out"
27-10-2017T01:21:50,CrimsonHelsing,Well said Sage on both accounts
27-10-2017T01:22:00,Kamaro12,"it's why I don't like stuff like Game of Thrones. I haven't watched any episode all the way through, but I get enough of an idea from the clips I've seen"
27-10-2017T01:22:09,Kamaro12,episodes*
27-10-2017T01:22:11,unsteddyphoenix,"Exactly. There is no ""good"" or ""bad"" griffith, there's only ""ambitious"" griffith"
27-10-2017T01:22:33,CrimsonHelsing,Yeah GoT is pretty messed up
27-10-2017T01:22:35,unsteddyphoenix,Berserk is far less dark now though. Seems like it'll even have a happy ending prolly
27-10-2017T01:22:53,Unenlagia,Though it'll be earned
27-10-2017T01:22:58,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"super eyepatch wolf on youtube said, that in berserk there is no real ""good and Evil"""
27-10-2017T01:23:00,unsteddyphoenix,Oh yeah.
27-10-2017T01:23:13,Twokinds,I've never seen GoT
27-10-2017T01:23:19,Ordithus,Hmm I think I could be wrong on when exactly this Rose + Saria thing happened.
27-10-2017T01:23:22,CrimsonHelsing,"The author actually plans a happy ending for Guts, was quoted on that unsteddy"
27-10-2017T01:23:26,MarvTheHugPharaoh,GoT is a very watered down berserk
27-10-2017T01:23:30,Bgrmystr2,I don't really plan to watch GoT
27-10-2017T01:23:35,Bgrmystr2,"not interested, myself"
27-10-2017T01:23:37,Unenlagia,"Berserk starts grim and gritty, the situation for the characters gets brighter, then it all goes to hell"
27-10-2017T01:23:42,Ordithus,Raine says that Mary released her to Keidran territory after she was questioned
27-10-2017T01:23:49,Ordithus,So this could be years later.
27-10-2017T01:23:52,ZRO4825,"From what I saw of Berserk, there's no real good or evil because everyone's had to do evil shit at some point to survive"
27-10-2017T01:24:02,MarvTheHugPharaoh,^
27-10-2017T01:24:03,Ordithus,Caught spying... again.
27-10-2017T01:24:10,Unenlagia,"Now it's Guts clawing his way back, quite literally in some cases"
27-10-2017T01:24:15,SageSaga,actually- Guts as a character is very much a good guy
27-10-2017T01:24:25,MarvTheHugPharaoh,just has anger issues
27-10-2017T01:24:28,CrimsonHelsing,Yeah Midland is beyond messed up xP
27-10-2017T01:24:29,Zakuru,its 2:30!
27-10-2017T01:24:33,Zakuru,im working on a project!
27-10-2017T01:24:37,unsteddyphoenix,His armour fucks him up sometimes but that's it
27-10-2017T01:24:46,SageSaga,he will often interfere- make it about him- and wreck anything in his way- hes not really doing it for selfish reasons
27-10-2017T01:24:50,Zakuru,T^T
27-10-2017T01:24:51,ZRO4825,"It's 2:30, and I'm wondering what I'm doing with my life. :thinking:"
27-10-2017T01:25:15,unsteddyphoenix,If you take into consideration his life he's basically a shining angel compared to what he's been through
27-10-2017T01:25:17,SageSaga,he goes out of his way all the time to save people
27-10-2017T01:25:23,SageSaga,even if they dont want his help
27-10-2017T01:25:33,BadFoMo,@Zakuru //Troll don't over react; it's only 2:25 AM.
27-10-2017T01:25:40,BadFoMo,*Don't
27-10-2017T01:25:46,CrimsonHelsing,Or if they hate him for it afterwards xP
27-10-2017T01:25:52,Bgrmystr2,AYYY EnV again :D!
27-10-2017T01:25:55,Keklilyrandoms,it's 0825 CEST
27-10-2017T01:25:59,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"if Guts did not join the hawks, would he have gone out of his way to save now?"
27-10-2017T01:26:14,unsteddyphoenix,No he'd be dead probably lol
27-10-2017T01:26:24,Keklilyrandoms,and it's my day off why ain't I sleeping?
27-10-2017T01:26:33,CrimsonHelsing,"No point asking at this point, what happened happened, and for a reason"
27-10-2017T01:26:58,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I need to re-read berserk
27-10-2017T01:27:04,SageSaga,thats why hes conflicted - he feels like Griffith made him who he is- and Griffith hates and loves Guts because- He's better than Griffith in every way- Griffith created a hero beyond himself
27-10-2017T01:27:34,unsteddyphoenix,I thought Griffith wanted to be a king not a hero
27-10-2017T01:27:46,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Guts also was the first person to make Griffith forget his dream
27-10-2017T01:28:04,unsteddyphoenix,An unforgivable crime
27-10-2017T01:28:34,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Guts was the only person Griffith would sacrifice himself to protect

27-10-2017T01:35:29,Bgrmystr2,you could make an entire series on this side-story and people would love it to bits

27-10-2017T01:36:48,Twokinds,Probably not a good idea.
27-10-2017T01:36:51,iliar,"Good night, Tom!"
27-10-2017T01:36:58,unsteddyphoenix,Name ONE flaw
27-10-2017T01:37:01,Bgrmystr2,haha that'd be amazing
27-10-2017T01:37:10,Twokinds,It'll devolve into endless gender and species swap suggestions eventually.
27-10-2017T01:37:15,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
27-10-2017T01:37:17,Bgrmystr2,that's true xD

27-10-2017T01:37:23,Bgrmystr2,well
27-10-2017T01:37:26,Bgrmystr2,I guess perhaps maybe

27-10-2017T01:37:49,ZRO4825,"you said that's a vector layer you use for doing those lines, right Sage?"
27-10-2017T01:37:53,Dadrobit,"Oh, like that doesn't happen already with the Patreon suggestions lol."
27-10-2017T01:37:59,ZRO4825,"for the inking lines, I mean~"

27-10-2017T01:38:23,SageSaga,yeah i use a vector layer
27-10-2017T01:38:25,BluePhantom90,"Tom you know ""HalfKinds"" was good right! I finished the first chapter and was like ""NUUUUUU"""
27-10-2017T01:38:26,BadFoMo,I had to go to the Bathroom; what did I miss? Other than everything.
27-10-2017T01:38:30,Dadrobit,"Oh, only glanced at the comics... My bad. I need to be more observant..."
27-10-2017T01:38:31,ZRO4825,Are you just using G-pen?
27-10-2017T01:38:37,SageSaga,yep
27-10-2017T01:38:59,Casidhe,Thanks for streaming!
27-10-2017T01:39:56,ZRO4825,I'll have to start tinkering with settings on mine. I always seem to end up with fuzzy edges compared to the lines you put down.
27-10-2017T01:40:09,ZRO4825,"Probably partially lack of practice/experience, but still"
27-10-2017T01:40:28,ZRO4825,"Might not be working high enough resolution either, could be part of it. Never sure, lol"

27-10-2017T01:42:20,Dadrobit,Do you have Blast Processing?
27-10-2017T01:42:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
27-10-2017T01:42:27,ZRO4825,typically I'm working with smaller stuff. Like last I was just working with like 512x512.
27-10-2017T01:42:35,ZRO4825,300dpi I think
27-10-2017T01:42:59,SageSaga,you should do 512x512 at 72 then upscale it to 300dpi
27-10-2017T01:43:11,SageSaga,ink on that
27-10-2017T01:43:16,unsteddyphoenix,overclock your pen

27-10-2017T01:44:10,BluePhantom90,So tom left for good for bed huh
27-10-2017T01:44:11,ZRO4825,"pffft, a Sunfire would twist in half from a V12 of any sort I'm pretty sure XD"
27-10-2017T01:44:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,not if you make it mid engine
27-10-2017T01:44:31,ZRO4825,:thinking: Hmmm...

27-10-2017T02:12:15,ZRO4825,That...that is a hell of a figure of 18 o.O
27-10-2017T02:12:19,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Android 18 deployed airbags
27-10-2017T02:12:31,ZRO4825,"Also, somewhat looks like her spine might be broke XD"
27-10-2017T02:12:38,Bgrmystr2,"must have been a hard landing, marv ;v"
27-10-2017T02:12:48,MarvTheHugPharaoh,lol
27-10-2017T02:12:53,SageSaga,i own this one - http://img.amiami.jp/images/product/main/162//FIGURE-019728.jpg
27-10-2017T02:12:59,SageSaga,Mihari bought it for me
27-10-2017T02:13:06,Bgrmystr2,that one's nice
27-10-2017T02:13:16,MarvTheHugPharaoh,like that one more then the last one
27-10-2017T02:13:23,ZRO4825,"Now see, I like that one. That one at least it looks like she's leaning over on purpose"
27-10-2017T02:13:47,Bgrmystr2,yeah
27-10-2017T02:13:49,ZRO4825,The other one kinda looks like she's got some sort of rearward curve in her spine but she's trying to stand with her head still straight
27-10-2017T02:13:56,Bgrmystr2,right?
27-10-2017T02:14:04,Bgrmystr2,the first one looks kinda like her spine is broke
27-10-2017T02:14:11,Bgrmystr2,.. minus the fact that she's an android
27-10-2017T02:14:16,MarvTheHugPharaoh,it looked like a tree landed on her
27-10-2017T02:14:20,Bgrmystr2,haha
27-10-2017T02:14:22,ZRO4825,"Can still break it, if 16 is anything to go by!"
27-10-2017T02:14:27,SageSaga,you cant just minus the fact shes an android!
27-10-2017T02:14:30,ZRO4825,And 19...and 20....
27-10-2017T02:14:39,ZRO4825,And...pretty much every android so far other than 17 and 18...
27-10-2017T02:14:46,Bgrmystr2,"well I mean, I don't know if she has a spine, Sage"
27-10-2017T02:14:58,ZRO4825,"Actually, come to think of it, I think they ARE the only two androids from DB to NOT get smashed :thinking:"
27-10-2017T02:15:17,MarvTheHugPharaoh,they are
27-10-2017T02:15:27,Bgrmystr2,"I know humans have spines, but I don't know if 18 still has hers after she was turned into an android"
27-10-2017T02:15:28,MarvTheHugPharaoh,even the movie ones got crushed
27-10-2017T02:15:46,ZRO4825,Super Android 13 still holds a special place in my heart though.
27-10-2017T02:15:51,SageSaga,i need a Videl one next-
27-10-2017T02:15:56,ZRO4825,Only being I'm aware of that just straight up punched Goku in the dick.
27-10-2017T02:16:17,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"XD, with a trucker hat"
27-10-2017T02:16:18,Bgrmystr2,Haha
27-10-2017T02:16:45,SageSaga,not seeing a good Videl one- never mind
27-10-2017T02:17:00,ZRO4825,"Yeah, Videl for some reason has just never hit it off as a popular character :("
27-10-2017T02:17:19,SageSaga,http://img.amiami.jp/images/product/main/154//FIGURE-014852.jpg
27-10-2017T02:17:24,SageSaga,Bulma one looks good
27-10-2017T02:17:30,MarvTheHugPharaoh,agreed
27-10-2017T02:17:56,ZRO4825,"Bulma. She's been such a fashion-whore throughout that series, I swear, lol"

27-10-2017T02:18:18,ZRO4825,"I find it amusing how they poke fun at her in Super, like the one guy she goes to ask questions of is like ""And you're starting to sag just a little"" XD"
27-10-2017T02:18:32,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Rem!!!!
27-10-2017T02:18:46,Bgrmystr2,Bulma's spine looks JUST as broken XD

27-10-2017T02:27:42,ZRO4825,Like you just really need to Master Spark something? And you can't find Cirno?
27-10-2017T02:27:51,Bgrmystr2,ohh nuh

27-10-2017T02:27:59,Bgrmystr2,the fun part
27-10-2017T02:28:04,Bgrmystr2,..ok the OTHER fun part
27-10-2017T02:28:51,ZRO4825,"Like you just stole a bunch of books from Patchi's library and you're being chased by an angry librarian, a depressed Koakuma, an apathetic maid, and a laughing vampire girl?"
27-10-2017T02:29:19,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-confused:
27-10-2017T02:29:29,Bgrmystr2,you uh.. have a very strange understanding of fun.
27-10-2017T02:29:41,ZRO4825,No. I foresee Marisa having a very strange sense of fun.
27-10-2017T02:29:51,ZRO4825,Because I foresee her being the type to get VERY bored....very easily.
27-10-2017T02:31:03,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno about that lol I think she'd probably be snarky, sarcastic, and teasy, but you know, maybe you're right. She probably loves the thrill of that kinda stuff"
27-10-2017T02:31:31,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-wondering: too little to go on
27-10-2017T02:31:47,ZRO4825,That's what I'm thinking myself. She enjoys incidents because they're exciting.
27-10-2017T02:31:54,ZRO4825,Reimu just gets irritated with'em.
27-10-2017T02:32:12,ZRO4825,"Yukari. Well, Yukari causes some of them, so...who fuckin knows? :rofl:"
27-10-2017T02:32:35,Bgrmystr2,"Marisa's just bored, Reimu just wants peace cuz she doesn't get any recognition for solving problems anyway"

27-10-2017T08:11:54,denmander,I currently have a stray kitten in my house : P
27-10-2017T08:12:00,denmander,it makes a lot of noise
27-10-2017T08:12:26,FFrost,Huh... Maybe something in between then like Meuff?Mawoo?
27-10-2017T08:13:17,Nekonny,"well, let it go sen XD"
27-10-2017T08:13:39,denmander,it's badly nourished and missing a good chunck of fur
27-10-2017T08:14:16,denmander,it probably dies if it just left
27-10-2017T08:14:33,denmander,also... it may have gotten chased by a very large labrador during a whole night...
27-10-2017T08:17:36,Nekonny,ah i see

27-10-2017T08:26:08,MrAMP,Asking as it is COLD down here.
27-10-2017T08:26:40,denmander,the meowing cat didn't keep me up last night
27-10-2017T08:28:43,MrAMP,XD
27-10-2017T08:28:51,MrAMP,And how's this new comic coming alonng?
27-10-2017T08:30:29,denmander,steadily I think?
27-10-2017T08:30:46,Nekonny,^
27-10-2017T08:31:24,Mislakane,it must go faster
27-10-2017T08:31:26,Mislakane,moer energy
27-10-2017T08:31:31,Mislakane,more bit coins
27-10-2017T08:32:14,denmander,I guess I could fill this bottle with coffee instead of water and see if that helps productivity
27-10-2017T08:33:59,MrAMP,More determinaiton.
27-10-2017T08:34:23,denmander,-less depression-
27-10-2017T08:41:41,MrAMP,More cats.
27-10-2017T08:41:57,denmander,this cat isn't mine
27-10-2017T08:43:15,MrAMP,She has a nice bod.
27-10-2017T08:43:33,MrAMP,That guy must have several references or that woman surfed the hot model site. XD
27-10-2017T08:44:13,denmander,you'll find out eventually <.<
27-10-2017T08:47:38,Nekonny,"so, that GeneralMarcoMiller guy"
27-10-2017T08:49:47,Masterzero86,Oh that smug face x3
27-10-2017T08:51:16,Nekonny,Wendys inspired
27-10-2017T08:51:36,MrAMP,"Yeah, what about him?"
27-10-2017T08:52:00,Nekonny,How do you guys think is the best way to handle people that come into streams asking for free requests
27-10-2017T08:52:01,Masterzero86,At least a better meme then the THICC meme...
27-10-2017T08:52:28,Nekonny,"I mean, people that just out of the blue show up and are obviously just tossing it everywhere to see what works"
27-10-2017T08:54:07,Mislakane,warning
27-10-2017T08:54:10,Mislakane,if they keep at it
27-10-2017T08:54:11,Mislakane,kick
27-10-2017T08:55:13,MrAMP,Quite simple...
27-10-2017T08:55:17,MrAMP,Warn them once.
27-10-2017T08:55:20,MrAMP,They keep doing it...ban them.
27-10-2017T08:55:45,MrAMP,There are billions of people on the world.  ONe banned person won't make a difference.
27-10-2017T08:56:50,SpotTheLeopard,Kindly - Inform them you don't do that. Authoritatively - warn/kick/ban. Troll - have a horrid backup sketch to give them
27-10-2017T08:57:54,SpotTheLeopard,"Good morning, all"
27-10-2017T08:58:25,Nekonny,heya
27-10-2017T08:58:30,Nekonny,I like that last one XD
27-10-2017T08:58:41,Nekonny,"I mean, sometimes it's innocent enough"
27-10-2017T08:59:04,Nekonny,"they are new, they don't understand the ethics of what they are doing"
27-10-2017T08:59:23,Nekonny,like a kid stealing money from a walleyt he cound
27-10-2017T08:59:28,SpotTheLeopard,That's why I have three different tiers of what to do XD
27-10-2017T09:01:34,Nekonny,"enjoy watching the stream, thats already free GeneralMarcoMiller: its boring to watch, like nothing to do"
27-10-2017T09:02:30,ZoieFalcona,*still enjoys watching Nekonny stream*
27-10-2017T09:03:11,ZoieFalcona,:GeneralMarcoMiller:
27-10-2017T09:03:15,ZoieFalcona,hmm... bleh
27-10-2017T09:03:54,denmander,"I might learn something, but more probably won't :P"
27-10-2017T09:04:41,Mislakane,hey zoie
27-10-2017T09:06:19,Nekonny,"and then he kept telling me he "" had nothing"""
27-10-2017T09:06:36,Mislakane,you gotta show the free loaders no mercy
27-10-2017T09:08:07,Masterzero86,Brb doggy needs me
27-10-2017T09:08:23,Nekonny,"I mean, I try to be nice"
27-10-2017T09:08:30,Nekonny,and even take the time to explain
27-10-2017T09:08:55,Nekonny,Do I seem like a jerk if I just cut them off as soon as they ask?
27-10-2017T09:09:01,denmander,"The good side of getting no viewers, don't have to deal with any of that :p"
27-10-2017T09:09:02,Mislakane,nope
27-10-2017T09:09:14,Mislakane,most of them arent really broke
27-10-2017T09:09:18,Mislakane,just trying their luck
27-10-2017T09:10:13,Nekonny,just because it's the internet doent mean you have to check your shame at the door
27-10-2017T09:10:29,SpotTheLeopard,"Other troll move would be, instant stream request gratifications must pay the upfront cost of $1000 (or whatever price point would make it worthwhile)"
27-10-2017T09:10:32,Nekonny,"I mean, you have nothing, and thats ok"
27-10-2017T09:10:48,Nekonny,but then you come in and want free work
27-10-2017T09:11:20,Nekonny,why don't you ask me to go to the street corner and beg for 3 hours
27-10-2017T09:11:45,Mislakane,cause thats what they like to do
27-10-2017T09:11:47,Mislakane,guilt trip
27-10-2017T09:12:16,Nekonny,"Iand I told him, ""you may not understand it, but thats considered offensive"""
27-10-2017T11:21:55,LeKnightWolf,hello...
27-10-2017T12:51:10,drykeon,helol
27-10-2017T13:45:11,LeKnightWolf,hey Drykeon what's up.
27-10-2017T14:02:37,SageSaga,howdy

27-10-2017T14:08:51,sunblaze,hiya everyone
27-10-2017T14:09:47,SageSaga,yo Sunblaze
27-10-2017T14:10:29,sunblaze,ohhh nice wolfie. finally a challenge worthy an elf :D
27-10-2017T14:10:54,SageSaga,hardly XD
27-10-2017T14:19:36,w0lfmare,:cw0lfmare-HeadEmber:
27-10-2017T14:20:14,SageSaga,yo w0lf
27-10-2017T14:20:31,w0lfmare,Hello
27-10-2017T14:21:20,SageSaga,brb foodz
27-10-2017T14:23:38,FoxxTrotter,:0)
27-10-2017T14:26:28,SageSaga,back
27-10-2017T14:43:07,aeoronwah,Heya
27-10-2017T14:43:28,SageSaga,yo Aeoronwah
27-10-2017T14:48:51,SageSaga,im gonna have to draw a lot of forests in this arc...
27-10-2017T14:49:35,sunblaze,better learn your trees!
27-10-2017T14:51:53,SageSaga,i was an RA not a Boy Scout
27-10-2017T15:01:06,SageSaga,time to get to the wolf... jeez hes gonna be a pain- what do i use for fur
27-10-2017T15:03:24,GioCarMan,ello sage
27-10-2017T15:03:48,SageSaga,yo Gio
27-10-2017T15:04:52,GioCarMan,hmmm so what are you trying to do with the fur?
27-10-2017T15:05:23,SageSaga,make it look like fur
27-10-2017T15:06:24,SageSaga,gonna use water color for now- might go back and detail it more once im done with the basics
27-10-2017T15:07:06,GioCarMan,"alright, the water color is making it look more like fur right now"
27-10-2017T15:29:29,sunblaze,to be honest in her place I would cry for joy and hug the wolf till it gets annoyed.
27-10-2017T15:30:15,sunblaze,strangely I actually made that with a RPG-char of mine and a unicorn twice :D
27-10-2017T15:30:24,sunblaze,hugging is required!
27-10-2017T15:30:50,SageSaga,gotta be careful with them Unicorns though
27-10-2017T15:31:57,ZahnHolley,:ptv-sad: sniff... sniff...
27-10-2017T15:31:58,SageSaga,lots of creepy lore revolves around Unicorns
27-10-2017T15:32:04,SageSaga,hi Zahn
27-10-2017T15:32:13,ZahnHolley,Hi....
27-10-2017T15:32:44,sunblaze,well the char was a virgin female so the unicorn was tame and friendly
27-10-2017T15:33:48,SageSaga,some Unicorn lore involves them carrying away virgin females with the promise of taking them to a special place- where they then stomp their heads in and feast on their flesh
27-10-2017T15:34:07,sunblaze,ahh good times :D
27-10-2017T15:35:44,FoxxTrotter,Heh...sounds like it. :0P
27-10-2017T15:35:50,w0lfmare,Oh dear
27-10-2017T15:36:02,ZahnHolley,Hi fox
27-10-2017T15:36:10,FoxxTrotter,"E'lo, Zahn."
27-10-2017T15:36:37,SageSaga,ever wonder why there are no humans in My Little Pony anymore? There ya go
27-10-2017T15:36:43,GioCarMan,woah
27-10-2017T15:37:01,sunblaze,now you are just nasty sage :D
27-10-2017T15:37:42,GioCarMan,so if you see a unicorn you should just kill it
27-10-2017T15:37:45,SageSaga,i havent even gotten to the nasty stuff about Unicorns
27-10-2017T15:37:50,GioCarMan,got it
27-10-2017T15:37:57,SageSaga,oh god no- dont kill a unicorn
27-10-2017T15:38:02,SageSaga,it will curse you
27-10-2017T15:38:08,GioCarMan,thats unfair
27-10-2017T15:38:11,FoxxTrotter,"Kill Unicron, not Unicorn."
27-10-2017T15:38:21,GioCarMan,whats the curse
27-10-2017T15:38:53,SageSaga,lore has a bunch of different curses- one is eternal life not not eternal youth-
27-10-2017T15:39:03,SageSaga,life but not*
27-10-2017T15:40:05,GioCarMan,"that sucks, you cant have the peace of ever dying"
27-10-2017T15:40:12,SageSaga,i think another one is necrosis that takes over your entire body
27-10-2017T15:40:31,SageSaga,think about being physically 200 years old and unable to die
27-10-2017T15:40:51,GioCarMan,yeah and seeing all your friends go
27-10-2017T15:41:26,GioCarMan,man unicorns have no mercy
27-10-2017T15:42:21,GioCarMan,so the only option for me is to run away?
27-10-2017T15:42:51,GioCarMan,no possible way of killing it without being curse?
27-10-2017T15:42:53,sunblaze,empty your backpack and THEN run away
27-10-2017T15:42:56,SageSaga,generally you dont need to run- unless its pursuing you in which case- hope you can run faster than a race horse?
27-10-2017T15:43:07,sunblaze,works with bears too. give them something to eat/keep them busy
27-10-2017T15:43:24,SageSaga,lol you only have to run faster than your friend
27-10-2017T15:43:52,sunblaze,yeah no need to be the fastest just be faster then someone :D
27-10-2017T15:44:33,GioCarMan,Unicorns are to over powered
27-10-2017T15:44:51,GioCarMan,come on i have to sacrifice a fat dude to escape
27-10-2017T15:45:19,SageSaga,it might be possible to kill it without being cursed
27-10-2017T15:45:32,SageSaga,but the area covered in its blood will be cursed
27-10-2017T15:46:08,GioCarMan,hmmmm
27-10-2017T15:46:25,GioCarMan,yeah i think i should just stray away from unicorns
27-10-2017T15:46:27,SageSaga,you would have to kill it without being seen or known- so a sniper shot would do it- oh and breaking its horn might work too- that would cut it off from most of its power- but its blood could still curse you
27-10-2017T15:47:31,GioCarMan,welp if a unicorn was in the modern times than i would risk it with the sniper shot but if i have to kill it with a bow an arrow i wouldn't take the shot
27-10-2017T15:47:58,GioCarMan,i wouldn't even think about going for the horn
27-10-2017T15:48:17,GioCarMan,i know it will just spot or hear me as soon as i get close to it
27-10-2017T15:49:26,SageSaga,"they can also teleport so if you see it and it disappears and you hear ""You are already dead"" make sure you scream ""NANI?!"" for memes before it plunges its horn through your back and into your heart"
27-10-2017T15:49:39,GioCarMan,lol sage
27-10-2017T15:49:59,GioCarMan,where's that nerf for the unicorn at?
27-10-2017T15:50:07,GioCarMan,I stand no chance
27-10-2017T15:50:20,SageSaga,Dragons can eat them without being affected by the curses
27-10-2017T15:50:42,GioCarMan,oh yeah let me just tame a DARN DRAGON REAL QUICK
27-10-2017T15:51:05,SageSaga,Demons and Devils too- Devils love making deals so you could do that
27-10-2017T15:51:11,GioCarMan,Nah
27-10-2017T15:51:14,GioCarMan,Never
27-10-2017T15:51:15,ZahnHolley,"That thing is huge,"
27-10-2017T15:51:24,GioCarMan,I like my soul too much
27-10-2017T15:51:29,GioCarMan,even if its empty
27-10-2017T15:51:37,SageSaga,dont make deals with a Fey though- they might be unable to lie but they with screw you hard
27-10-2017T15:51:46,GioCarMan,ah so word play
27-10-2017T15:52:11,SageSaga,they are masters of dancing around truth and lies
27-10-2017T15:52:17,GioCarMan,I wish there was just something to remove curses
27-10-2017T15:52:30,GioCarMan,I dont want to make deals with anyone
27-10-2017T15:52:45,SageSaga,XD that reminded me of the terrible movie Dracula 2000
27-10-2017T15:53:31,ZahnHolley,I.ll seeya around sage bye
27-10-2017T15:53:37,SageSaga,"*holds out a cross at the vampire* ""Sorry, Im an atheist!"" *Dagger extends from the bottom of the cross* ""God loves you anyways"" *eye stab*"
27-10-2017T15:53:41,SageSaga,take care Zahn
27-10-2017T15:53:58,GioCarMan,lol
27-10-2017T15:56:26,SageSaga,it was like the only good thing in the whole movie
27-10-2017T15:57:35,GioCarMan,a 17% on rotten tomatoes
27-10-2017T15:57:49,SageSaga,"they were all like ""I understand why holy water and the cross works on him - but why Silver?"" and im like ""Because it's literally a symbol of purity in culture"" and they are like ""There must be a special reason"""
27-10-2017T15:59:11,GioCarMan,I feel like i would be that person asking the dumb questions
27-10-2017T15:59:20,SageSaga,"the twist- Dracula is actually Judas, the Betrayer, the man who sold Jesus out for 30 silver coins"
27-10-2017T16:00:01,SageSaga,"im like ""So why do you make him look like a handsome young man? Judas is well depicted and he is and was not a young heart-throb esque character"
27-10-2017T16:01:16,GioCarMan,im guessing because no one wants a old man with possible heart problems as a vampire
27-10-2017T16:01:27,GioCarMan,got to appeal to the audience
27-10-2017T16:01:57,GioCarMan,just imagine an old man trying to suck your blood
27-10-2017T16:02:15,SageSaga,so why not go with the classic Cain?
27-10-2017T16:02:47,GioCarMan,ah that is the question for the producers of the film
27-10-2017T16:03:36,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-sleepy: I slept hard
27-10-2017T16:03:39,Bgrmystr2,good morning
27-10-2017T16:03:41,GioCarMan,hey bgr
27-10-2017T16:04:12,FoxxTrotter,"Hey, Bgr."
27-10-2017T16:04:19,SageSaga,"i get why they didnt go full on and just make him Jesus and be like ""the silver is what he was sold for so hes weak to it- he was also killed on a Cross so he has an aversion to it and is forsaken for everyones sins -you know- do a big"
27-10-2017T16:04:36,SageSaga,"""you think dying once was enough to take care of all of humanities sins?"""
27-10-2017T16:04:59,GioCarMan,yeah
27-10-2017T16:05:44,SageSaga,"i get that it would never have been green lit if they said ""What if the enemy- was Jesus"""
27-10-2017T16:05:51,SageSaga,but still- would be a cooler story
27-10-2017T16:06:40,GioCarMan,just imagine trying to sell that to movie studios
27-10-2017T16:07:02,GioCarMan,"""so who's the main enemy in this film"""
27-10-2017T16:07:07,GioCarMan,"""Its jesus"""

27-10-2017T16:07:21,Bgrmystr2,xD
27-10-2017T16:07:23,SageSaga,pretty much
27-10-2017T16:07:39,SageSaga,although- i think Drifters is literally doing just that
27-10-2017T16:08:10,Bgrmystr2,"Personally, I like the idea of the villain of a story being someone who everyone thinks is supposed to be good"
27-10-2017T16:10:38,GioCarMan,drifters has warriors fighting jesus?
27-10-2017T16:12:09,SageSaga,it's believed that the big bad guy in Drifters is Jesus
27-10-2017T16:12:54,SageSaga,"because he has healing powers, stigmata, and is shrouded"
27-10-2017T16:13:10,GioCarMan,if jesus has an evil within him or was corrupted somehow than i think it makes more sense
27-10-2017T16:13:24,SageSaga,he also gave a dragon cancer which fits in line with godlike powers and healing
27-10-2017T16:13:49,GioCarMan,yeah that sounds about right
27-10-2017T16:15:11,SageSaga,also the whole story is all about historical figures being brought to this other world
27-10-2017T16:17:45,SageSaga,Hitler was in the world too but he is presumed to be dead
27-10-2017T16:17:50,SageSaga,again
27-10-2017T16:17:58,GioCarMan,slow clap
27-10-2017T16:18:16,GioCarMan,when you get a second chance but still mess up
27-10-2017T16:18:37,SageSaga,he apparently built an empire though
27-10-2017T16:18:51,SageSaga,and enslaved all the Dwarves and Elves... classic hitler
27-10-2017T16:19:08,GioCarMan,so the historical figures can change their outcomes from last time then
27-10-2017T16:19:21,SageSaga,its a different world
27-10-2017T16:19:44,GioCarMan,correct but they lived a past life right
27-10-2017T16:20:07,SageSaga,they enter the world at the age they died
27-10-2017T16:20:13,GioCarMan,so they have the knowledge of their past selfs right?
27-10-2017T16:20:26,SageSaga,yep - all of it
27-10-2017T16:20:55,GioCarMan,and yet hilter didn't keep himself alive this time
27-10-2017T16:21:24,SageSaga,?
27-10-2017T16:21:57,GioCarMan,he died again in the other world right?
27-10-2017T16:22:31,SageSaga,it's assumed - but he could have died from old age- the time they appear is kinda random
27-10-2017T16:22:56,SageSaga,not everyone is from the same time period appearing in this world at random times-
27-10-2017T16:23:23,GioCarMan,ah okay
27-10-2017T16:23:25,SageSaga,for example- a Japanese WW2 pilot joined shortly after a Samurai appeared
27-10-2017T16:23:53,SageSaga,hundreds of years apart - arrived within days of each other
27-10-2017T16:26:19,Nekonny,o/
27-10-2017T16:26:28,GioCarMan,I think I understand now

27-10-2017T16:29:54,Nekonny,I need to get some pointers from everyone... although my stuff tends to be in more urban enviroments
27-10-2017T16:31:57,Mihari,"Yah, no more preset banana trees for you!"
27-10-2017T16:32:31,FoxxTrotter,:banana::banana::banana:
27-10-2017T16:33:52,Nekonny,"urk, random pc crash"
