06-12-2017T02:46:49,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, I figure the house has food stores"

06-12-2017T02:47:08,Bgrmystr2,it has to come from somewhere
06-12-2017T02:47:13,Dadrobit,Unsteddy probably has it right where it has to be permanent or else they would have caught on quick. Unless the spell uses a mind-wipe after a week or so and they just wake up with a gnarly headache and a mouth full of feed.
06-12-2017T02:47:21,unsteddyphoenix,Rose would have to go outside to get more food and then she'd be vulnerable.
06-12-2017T02:47:29,unsteddyphoenix,But this way...food is delievered to their doorstep
06-12-2017T02:47:34,Bgrmystr2,"that's what I'm thinking, phoenix"
06-12-2017T02:48:02,unsteddyphoenix,I adore how this makes the most sense

06-12-2017T16:04:42,iZute,i first went from tenor 1 to bass then to baritone to tenor 2
06-12-2017T16:04:55,iZute,and im like WHAAAA?
06-12-2017T16:05:14,iZute,ive litterally sang all of the guys parts at some point

06-12-2017T16:05:38,iZute,so its just like MAKE UP YO MIND TEACH
06-12-2017T16:06:15,iZute,and its funny because i like to sing baritone because its the most comfortable
06-12-2017T16:06:21,iZute,BUT
06-12-2017T16:06:44,iZute,when ever she is testing us for voice parts Im the ONLY GUY she said this to:

06-12-2017T16:10:04,iZute,)*
06-12-2017T16:10:12,TheJashter,"Indeed, he has improved greatly!"
06-12-2017T16:10:31,TheBeckoner,"this is true. I evaluate things based off of effort and ability. for instance I usually say ""can I learn this? yes"" ""is it worth it to me? no."" lol"

06-12-2017T17:39:52,Bgrmystr2,but he does doodle things that happen in the chat
06-12-2017T17:40:53,TheJashter,"Good to know, thanks for the warning."
06-12-2017T17:42:00,TheJashter,"I really only made an account to participate in Tom's chat though, lol"
06-12-2017T17:42:33,MidnightBlue78,thats what i did too

06-12-2017T17:43:27,TheJashter,I might branch out to look for more if I get bored
06-12-2017T17:43:34,TheJashter,But that's rare
06-12-2017T17:44:14,MidnightBlue78,"i never wander far, i always come back here"
06-12-2017T17:44:53,TheJashter,"It's just so nice here, I like the atmosphere and interactivity of this stream :)"

06-12-2017T17:52:43,MidnightBlue78,hey Dadro
06-12-2017T17:52:45,Bgrmystr2,attempting to go inside of a house without permission is a serious offense.
06-12-2017T17:52:59,MidnightBlue78,they had it coming
06-12-2017T17:53:14,TheJashter,"True, true"
06-12-2017T17:53:38,Dadrobit,"Soooo, Picarto changing their policies, charging folks their overhead now. Wonder how much backlash that's gonna get?"
06-12-2017T17:53:44,Dadrobit,Patreon*
06-12-2017T17:53:55,TheJashter,Huh?
06-12-2017T17:54:08,unsteddyphoenix,According to fluff it's gonna be hard for people to support multiple artists
06-12-2017T17:54:10,MidnightBlue78,"oh yeah, i got an email about that"
06-12-2017T17:54:16,unsteddyphoenix,'cause you'll get fees from each one
06-12-2017T17:54:24,unsteddyphoenix,Also keep fighting dad~
06-12-2017T17:54:28,MidnightBlue78,"Yeah, thats gonna suck"
06-12-2017T17:55:00,TheJashter,"I had no idea, but I haven't donated yet. Should I wait in case they change it back?"
06-12-2017T17:55:05,Dadrobit,"Hey unsteddy, and thanks for the support."
06-12-2017T17:55:25,Dadrobit,Only one more semester and I'll have earned my certificate.
06-12-2017T17:55:42,TheJashter,Woo! You are super close! :D

06-12-2017T17:56:20,MidnightBlue78,patreon that is
06-12-2017T17:57:51,Dadrobit,I wonder how many folks are gonna see a loss in total revenue after the changes.
06-12-2017T17:57:58,unsteddyphoenix,Just donate 3% less of what you wouldve~
06-12-2017T17:58:13,Dadrobit,:( But that takes me out of the running...
06-12-2017T17:58:35,unsteddyphoenix,"Up your pledged now, then lower it when the changes happen"
06-12-2017T17:58:44,unsteddyphoenix,Beat the system
06-12-2017T17:58:50,TheJashter,That's the way to do it!
06-12-2017T17:59:33,TheJashter,"I have an idea for a sketch. Swap Reni's and Kei's species, see what happens. xD"
06-12-2017T17:59:42,TheJashter,I just need to donate though
06-12-2017T18:02:29,Bgrmystr2,Some creators are lowering their tiers by certain amounts so the patrons pay about the same as they would have before the change
06-12-2017T18:09:21,Dadrobit,Good on them!

06-12-2017T21:27:38,Dinoman515,I just hope i make it to the stream tomarrow. Dad's going into surgery to fix the shattered bones.
06-12-2017T21:27:55,Dinoman515,So i might not make it.
06-12-2017T21:28:07,iZute,awww that would suck

06-12-2017T21:29:33,TheJashter,"Yeah, just prepping for a final lab in class"
06-12-2017T21:29:38,Dinoman515,But he has to wear a massive cast.
06-12-2017T21:29:46,TheJashter,"Oof, rough!"

06-12-2017T21:30:22,Dinoman515,"He'll be fine, he's a strong dude."
06-12-2017T21:30:25,TheJashter,XD What class you doing

06-12-2017T21:30:45,TheJashter,"Ah, smart stuff"
06-12-2017T21:30:55,Nadroj341,I do not know what they are talking about
06-12-2017T21:31:00,Dinoman515,Not really...
06-12-2017T21:31:05,iZute,Nadroj341 can't speak english as clear of spanish so i want you to do something
06-12-2017T21:31:16,Dinoman515,Okay?
06-12-2017T21:31:25,Bgrmystr2,"Most internet translations are really, REALLY bad and inaccurate, Zute"
06-12-2017T21:31:36,iZute,right click the webpage and click translate to english
06-12-2017T21:31:41,TheJashter,"Im on mobile, so if that affects things..."
06-12-2017T21:32:03,iZute,sure but this allows me to communicate with him easily
06-12-2017T21:32:03,Dinoman515,"Not on my computer, pcs broken. Remember?"
06-12-2017T21:32:13,iZute,ah dang it!
06-12-2017T21:32:14,TheJashter,"Oh, ah. I cannot right click, but I do have a right thumb."
06-12-2017T21:32:16,Dinoman515,Cpu is fried
06-12-2017T21:32:25,iZute,forgot sorry guys
06-12-2017T21:32:36,TheJashter,Any idea on when you might get it fixed?
06-12-2017T21:32:39,Bgrmystr2,"also, not all browsers do that, Zute"
06-12-2017T21:32:48,TheJashter,Or will you just replace it?
06-12-2017T21:32:51,iZute,i know chrome does
06-12-2017T21:32:53,Dinoman515,"Its fine, once I get it back up i'll do that."
06-12-2017T21:32:59,Bgrmystr2,Chrome is likely the only one that does
06-12-2017T21:33:01,Bgrmystr2,cuz google translate
06-12-2017T21:33:09,Dinoman515,This weekend.
06-12-2017T21:33:10,Bgrmystr2,which is pretty garbage at translations overall
06-12-2017T21:33:18,iZute,i could check later if it works on safari and others
06-12-2017T21:33:22,Nadroj341,yes is true
06-12-2017T21:33:59,Dinoman515,Brb have to find out what y=mx.
06-12-2017T21:34:19,iZute,its been working fine for me for a while only a few minor grammatical errors that i could easily understand
06-12-2017T21:34:23,iZute,see ya soon
06-12-2017T21:34:40,Bgrmystr2,some languages are easier to translate than others
06-12-2017T21:34:42,TheJashter,Good luck! I'm gonna go finish this course up
06-12-2017T21:34:55,Bgrmystr2,"Japanese, for example, is terrible xD"
06-12-2017T21:35:00,iZute,mhm XD
06-12-2017T21:35:06,Nadroj341,ja xD
06-12-2017T21:35:12,iZute,but spanish is one of the easier ones
06-12-2017T21:36:26,CrRAR,"Hey hey, you guys, I just realized I had .08 of a bitcoin."
06-12-2017T21:36:32,CrRAR,XD
06-12-2017T21:36:37,iZute,for example be and nadroj were just having a full blown convo before and i was using the auto translate and i believe he was as well
06-12-2017T21:36:45,CrRAR,Completely forgot about it.

06-12-2017T22:47:08,TheJashter,"I believe the moon is just coming into view just about now for me, rising over the mountain tops"
06-12-2017T22:47:45,iZute,how long has it been dark for you?
06-12-2017T22:49:43,TheJashter,For maybe 3-4 hours

06-12-2017T22:50:59,iZute,and its llikely im going to miss every sunday stream ;-;-;-;-;-;
06-12-2017T22:51:13,iZute,because i work on sundays
06-12-2017T22:51:29,iZute,plus my shift normally ends at 6:30 NOOO
06-12-2017T22:53:27,TheJashter,"I generally miss the first part of it on sunday, but I hop in later"
06-12-2017T22:54:30,iZute,unless the stream is going to last around 4 hours im going to miss all of it!
06-12-2017T22:55:00,iZute,unlessi get that super rare chance where lets me leave early
06-12-2017T22:55:06,iZute,they*
06-12-2017T22:55:17,Bgrmystr2,Tom has streamed upwards of 6-7 hours sometimes
06-12-2017T22:55:35,iZute,W A T
06-12-2017T22:55:36,Bgrmystr2,but usually he's pretty damn fast on his drawings
06-12-2017T22:56:14,iZute,plus i dont like to watch the recording because i cant chat with all of you ;-;
06-12-2017T22:58:09,Bgrmystr2,"the stream on his recordings, the oldest one April 3rd, is 9 1/2 hrs"
06-12-2017T22:59:13,iZute,he streamed for 9 and a half hours?!
06-12-2017T22:59:23,TheJashter,"Yeah, I usually show up 2 hours late or so on sunday, and he goes another 4 or 5 hours"
06-12-2017T22:59:36,Bgrmystr2,yeah he streams for quite a while
06-12-2017T22:59:51,iZute,i hope so ;-;
06-12-2017T22:59:53,TheJashter,"Its amazing, I can't imagine how bad his hand must hurt after xS"
06-12-2017T23:00:05,iZute,i really don't like to miss them
06-12-2017T23:00:09,Bgrmystr2,"it doesn't always hurt, from what it seems like"
06-12-2017T23:00:11,Bgrmystr2,sometimes it does
06-12-2017T23:00:14,Bgrmystr2,sometimes it doesn't
06-12-2017T23:00:28,Bgrmystr2,it totally depends on the complexity and ease of the drawing he's doing
06-12-2017T23:00:40,Bgrmystr2,whether it requires more stress to his hand while he's drawing it
06-12-2017T23:00:49,iZute,maybe he has a pen that fits his hand very comfortably
06-12-2017T23:01:24,Bgrmystr2,xD that's not really the problem I don't think. It's just the sheer length of time combined with muscle strain
06-12-2017T23:01:37,Dinoman515,"It gets tiring, trust me. Even with your comfortable stuff it still gets tiring."
06-12-2017T23:02:35,Dinoman515,Time √ó Aching + Style = Tom's Streams.
06-12-2017T23:02:50,iZute,i know! and my hand hurts sometimes when im just writing in class
06-12-2017T23:02:58,iZute,wow XD
06-12-2017T23:03:40,Bgrmystr2,"it's just something you can or can't do. I can't draw since I don't have the hand muscles for it, but I could type all hours of the day"
06-12-2017T23:04:05,Dinoman515,Unless you get some sorta sci-fi robotic arm.
06-12-2017T23:04:07,OMGITSABIST,Most of the times I only get to watch the first 2 sketches in Sunday streams due to time zones and school.
06-12-2017T23:04:11,iZute,yea
06-12-2017T23:04:31,Bgrmystr2,"those aren't dextrious enough yet, Dino"
06-12-2017T23:04:33,Bgrmystr2,unfortunately.
06-12-2017T23:04:38,Bgrmystr2,but they're improving.
06-12-2017T23:04:58,OMGITSABIST,And I wake up 5 am every Monday to vote
06-12-2017T23:05:16,Dinoman515,O_O
06-12-2017T23:05:44,TheJashter,Woah man! Dedication!
06-12-2017T23:06:09,iZute,Holy!
06-12-2017T23:06:11,Dinoman515,His streams start around noonish for me?!
06-12-2017T23:06:18,OMGITSABIST,I find it a great incentive to wake up on Mondays
06-12-2017T23:06:34,Dinoman515,But 5 a.m.?! Wow.
06-12-2017T23:07:01,iZute,thats super early!
06-12-2017T23:07:18,OMGITSABIST,Have to head for school at 7 anyways
06-12-2017T23:08:19,iZute,ah taking advantage of the early time you wake up
06-12-2017T23:18:43,Dinoman515,Lurking in the Darkness?
06-12-2017T23:21:12,iZute,im assuming so XD
06-12-2017T23:26:45,iZute,"im curious, the sketch streams are those the streams where he sketches out all the pages of the comic and the illustrations for NoraCards and suggestions?"
06-12-2017T23:27:00,iZute,or does he do that while he isnt streaming?
06-12-2017T23:32:13,Bgrmystr2,The Sketch streams on sunday are for Patron suggestions.
06-12-2017T23:32:36,Bgrmystr2,The sketches for the comic tom does off-screen.
06-12-2017T23:32:41,Bgrmystr2,"We don't see those, usually."
06-12-2017T23:33:15,iZute,i can kinda understand that actually spoiling before he starts drawing it
06-12-2017T23:33:28,Bgrmystr2,And the Nora Cards are just tom inking and coloring the sketches he's already done via the sketch streams on sunday or possibly any images he has on deviantart
06-12-2017T23:34:10,Bgrmystr2,"he usually sketches the comic page without being on stream. When he streams the ink / color of a comic page, it goes up after the stream finishes."
06-12-2017T23:34:31,iZute,thanks for filling me in
06-12-2017T23:34:50,Bgrmystr2,Glad to be of service o7 :ptv-victory:
06-12-2017T23:35:07,iZute,dear lord XD
