10-11-2017T00:04:44,crimsonreaper,"i think shes screaming in desperation ""AHHHH let me down!"" cause she did say ""wait.. me in the air"" or something like that"
10-11-2017T00:05:33,CrimsonHelsing,The bag is cramped and she's complaining xP
10-11-2017T00:05:52,crimsonreaper,regardless she aint happy heh

10-11-2017T00:09:57,crimsonreaper,smells like my upstairs neighbors have pizza
10-11-2017T00:10:31,MarvTheHugPharaoh,steal it
10-11-2017T00:10:32,SageSaga,"ya know- for a long time while drawing i didnt really think ""Ok which hand will this character be doing this with?"" even though it's relatively important-"
10-11-2017T00:10:51,crimsonreaper,haha
10-11-2017T00:10:52,BluePhantom90,yeah its weird for me today as well. I feel like falling asleep but I really don't want too.
10-11-2017T00:10:54,crimsonreaper,yea it is
10-11-2017T00:11:01,SageSaga,but mostly because i dont think about it all that often because im ambidextrous
10-11-2017T00:11:13,crimsonreaper,ah yea makes sense
10-11-2017T00:11:28,crimsonreaper,most people use primarily one arm for most things
10-11-2017T00:11:34,SageSaga,"""oh your character is left handed?"" ""What? no- oh no"""
10-11-2017T00:11:38,crimsonreaper,me im wierd i use mostly one side
10-11-2017T00:12:01,crimsonreaper,which it shows cause my whole right is fragged
10-11-2017T00:12:05,SageSaga,baseball was very confusing for me
10-11-2017T00:12:25,crimsonreaper,yea that could be abit confusing
10-11-2017T00:12:29,SpotTheLeopard,I never knew which side of the plate to stand on for baseball
10-11-2017T00:13:33,ZRO4825,Depends on if you're left or right handed
10-11-2017T00:13:46,SpotTheLeopard,"I'm primarily a lefty, but there are some tasks where I'm just confused"
10-11-2017T00:13:50,crimsonreaper,"they use both, thats why they where ?_?"
10-11-2017T00:14:13,w0lfmare,:cw0lfmare-HeadEmber:
10-11-2017T00:14:18,crimsonreaper,hey wolf

10-11-2017T00:14:28,MarvTheHugPharaoh,W0LFY!!!!!!!!
10-11-2017T00:14:29,SageSaga,when throwing a baseball i always threw left
10-11-2017T00:14:34,Bgrmystr2,heya w0lf
10-11-2017T00:14:42,unsteddyphoenix,Yo w0lf
10-11-2017T00:15:15,SageSaga,my team captain thought i was left handed and was utterly confused when i signed my name on the team banner
10-11-2017T00:15:16,Nekonny,I should take a snack break
10-11-2017T00:15:18,MarvTheHugPharaoh,loving this troonks Nero
10-11-2017T00:15:23,Nekonny,brb
10-11-2017T00:15:26,Combak,Hi W0lf!
10-11-2017T00:15:28,MarvTheHugPharaoh,have fun Ron
10-11-2017T00:15:53,unsteddyphoenix,He looks pretty badass
10-11-2017T00:15:59,crimsonreaper,so how goes the hunt for something to read wolf?
10-11-2017T00:16:41,neropan,wooolf
10-11-2017T00:16:49,SpotTheLeopard,"yep. My mom writes left-handed, unless it's on the wall board. Then she's righthanded. Confusing."
10-11-2017T00:17:58,SageSaga,well if she wrote left handed on a chalk or white board she would erase as she wrote
10-11-2017T00:18:05,Bgrmystr2,So.. nora's wingspan is much larger than previously shown :thinking:
10-11-2017T00:18:13,ZizzoGaming,"Iâ€™m confused, and it was probably already discussed, but could somebody please inform me why there are to different versions of this page?"
10-11-2017T00:18:18,Bgrmystr2,Reni*
10-11-2017T00:18:24,Bgrmystr2,my brain is all sorts of broked
10-11-2017T00:18:38,SageSaga,Zizzo - because this one is better
10-11-2017T00:18:51,ZizzoGaming,Got it. Thanks
10-11-2017T00:18:56,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"you borked our brain, BGR"
10-11-2017T00:18:57,crimsonreaper,tom being a perfectionist was not happy with the last version :P
10-11-2017T00:19:00,Bgrmystr2,Tom's redrawing it
10-11-2017T00:19:06,Bgrmystr2,he didn't like the previous one
10-11-2017T00:19:47,Bgrmystr2,"it's looking much nicer. To be fair, I did like Flora and Trace's hair blowing in the wind"
10-11-2017T00:19:53,crimsonreaper,this version of the page looks great so im not going to complain heh
10-11-2017T00:19:54,Bgrmystr2,and now it's not.
10-11-2017T00:20:12,BadFoMo,@ZizzoGaming Old on was to quickly explain why Group A was on there way to meet Group B for the 1000th page?
10-11-2017T00:20:24,crimsonreaper,besides i think the saddle bags are kind of a fun idea
10-11-2017T00:20:35,Bgrmystr2,This wouldn't have been 1000 though
10-11-2017T00:20:36,BadFoMo,*Old one
10-11-2017T00:20:38,Bgrmystr2,would have been 999
10-11-2017T00:21:15,crimsonreaper,the thousandth page is already in the archives if you include the chapter vanners and such
10-11-2017T00:21:23,BadFoMo,@Bgrmystr2 They weren't meeting pn that page.
10-11-2017T00:21:33,crimsonreaper,banners*
10-11-2017T00:21:42,BadFoMo,*arn't
10-11-2017T00:21:54,BadFoMo,*on
10-11-2017T00:22:41,Bgrmystr2,"they would've, originally. :thinking: least if this and the one after were going to be put on as-is"
10-11-2017T00:22:52,Bgrmystr2,but didn't happen that way
10-11-2017T00:23:29,SpotTheLeopard,I still think dragon crash explosion page is best page. :ptv-laugh:
10-11-2017T00:23:46,crimsonreaper,dragon crash explosion?
10-11-2017T00:23:57,Bgrmystr2,Hahahaha
10-11-2017T00:23:59,Bgrmystr2,that was the best
10-11-2017T00:24:21,SpotTheLeopard,"It was too much for Reni to carry them. Team A crashed into Team B, the end"
10-11-2017T00:24:38,BadFoMo,"I think I worded that wrong. That would have been page 999, they would have meet on page 1000."
10-11-2017T00:25:10,CrimsonHelsing,@crimsonreaper that sounded like that Battlefield1 Literal Trailer that Tobuscus did xD
10-11-2017T00:25:34,Bgrmystr2,yeh Fomo that's what I was thinking xD
10-11-2017T00:26:06,Bgrmystr2,This new page is looking nice though :D
10-11-2017T00:26:21,BadFoMo,@Bgrmystr2 Yep.
10-11-2017T00:26:47,Twokinds,"Dragon falls, everybody dies"
10-11-2017T00:26:53,Twokinds,Greatest page 1000 ever
10-11-2017T00:27:04,crimsonreaper,lol
10-11-2017T00:27:15,Bgrmystr2,hahaha
10-11-2017T00:27:15,ZizzoGaming,@Twokinds where can I find that?
10-11-2017T00:27:31,Bgrmystr2,the internet
10-11-2017T00:27:34,Bgrmystr2,probably.
10-11-2017T00:27:45,BadFoMo,"Welp, Twokinds is done. Time to move on to better things."
10-11-2017T00:27:51,Twokinds,I didn't save it.
10-11-2017T00:27:55,CrimsonHelsing,Lol yeah that was hilarious
10-11-2017T00:27:58,CrimsonHelsing,Aw
10-11-2017T00:28:03,Twokinds,"Er I mean, it's spoilers for the next page"
10-11-2017T00:28:10,BadFoMo,//Troll You fool!
10-11-2017T00:28:14,MidnightBlue78,xD

10-11-2017T00:28:41,SpotTheLeopard,aw XD
10-11-2017T00:29:43,w0lfmare,"Hunt for something to read? Ah, that's been going on for years"
10-11-2017T00:31:17,w0lfmare,I did read AI though
10-11-2017T00:31:48,ZizzoGaming,AI?
10-11-2017T00:31:50,SageSaga,and you were unimpressed T_T
10-11-2017T00:32:12,w0lfmare,I wouldn't say unimpressed
10-11-2017T00:32:25,SageSaga,ouch- not a firm denial either XD
10-11-2017T00:32:25,BadFoMo,What's the A stand for?
10-11-2017T00:32:30,w0lfmare,XD
10-11-2017T00:32:39,SageSaga,Artificial
10-11-2017T00:32:42,w0lfmare,Good enough to keep me reading ; P

10-11-2017T00:33:09,w0lfmare,Not not a new favorite
10-11-2017T00:33:13,SageSaga,Incident
10-11-2017T00:33:24,w0lfmare,"Though to be fair, it's still basically just getting started"
10-11-2017T00:33:30,crimsonreaper,yea
10-11-2017T00:33:32,SageSaga,chapter 3
10-11-2017T00:33:44,crimsonreaper,but basically the introductions just got finished
10-11-2017T00:33:56,crimsonreaper,so yea just started
10-11-2017T00:34:16,BadFoMo,"Ok, I got it. ...What's the A stand for again? Sage: Moving on..."
10-11-2017T00:34:38,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah you need buildup
10-11-2017T00:34:39,SageSaga,so cruel
10-11-2017T00:34:49,SageSaga,http://ai.katbox.net/

10-11-2017T00:37:55,Kamaro12,I don't remember
10-11-2017T00:38:00,w0lfmare,I think an android broke it?

10-11-2017T01:26:33,Serpentfrog,Does that give me control over the rat king?
10-11-2017T01:26:40,crimsonreaper,im fine with whatever tom decides because he was really killing himself around two years ago
10-11-2017T01:26:40,MarvTheHugPharaoh,no
10-11-2017T01:26:54,Serpentfrog,What about thefatrat?
10-11-2017T01:27:09,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:thinking:
10-11-2017T01:29:21,crimsonreaper,that reminds me in rpgs the most common begginner mobs are almost always rats and slimes...
10-11-2017T01:30:35,SageSaga,ive never ran an RPG where the first mission was rats or slime
10-11-2017T01:30:44,crimsonreaper,really?
10-11-2017T01:30:53,crimsonreaper,ive played tons like that
10-11-2017T01:30:57,Serpentfrog,"Never played Morrowind, sage?"
10-11-2017T01:31:12,SageSaga,please re-read what i said
10-11-2017T01:31:26,crimsonreaper,rats is a american european thing and slimes is more of a japanese thing
10-11-2017T01:31:34,unsteddyphoenix,Dragon Age had rats at the start
10-11-2017T01:31:39,unsteddyphoenix,They even made a meta joke about it
10-11-2017T01:32:29,unsteddyphoenix,"Something like ""that was like a classic adventure tale"""
10-11-2017T01:32:45,Ordithus,It would be a short rpg if they started against a dragon.
10-11-2017T01:32:52,SageSaga,"ive never ran such a game- ive played plenty of video games that did it - but never ran a RPG (DnD, Pathfinder, Savage World etc) and did that to my players"
10-11-2017T01:33:00,crimsonreaper,"personally i did not like dragon age, i found it glitchy, and awkward"
10-11-2017T01:33:34,unsteddyphoenix,"But, have you started your players in a tavern?"
10-11-2017T01:34:23,Serpentfrog,I start my players in rats and make them fight taverns.
10-11-2017T01:34:24,SageSaga,taverns are great places to start a RPG regardless- ive also started one in the pool house of one of the rich players parents estate
10-11-2017T01:34:41,unsteddyphoenix,lol frog
10-11-2017T01:34:56,crimsonreaper,you know whats great in D&D? the red sun campaign
10-11-2017T01:34:57,Ordithus,I once played one that started on a yacht.
10-11-2017T01:35:22,crimsonreaper,its also a great classic PC game
10-11-2017T01:35:32,SageSaga,fight the all mighty GAZEBO!
10-11-2017T01:35:38,crimsonreaper,lol
10-11-2017T01:35:46,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
10-11-2017T01:36:02,Ordithus,haha that reminds me of the house enemy in FF7.
10-11-2017T01:36:05,unsteddyphoenix,The pool house is now the miniboss
10-11-2017T01:36:06,Ordithus,So weird.
10-11-2017T01:37:06,crimsonreaper,not as weird as the game legend of gaia for PS1 where you basically are fighting a mountain as the end boss
10-11-2017T01:37:15,SageSaga,have you all heard the legend of the Gazebo?
10-11-2017T01:37:27,crimsonreaper,nope
10-11-2017T01:37:32,Bgrmystr2,I come back to legend of the Gazebo

10-11-2017T01:38:06,unsteddyphoenix,You gotta deliever
10-11-2017T01:38:20,Twokinds,It's not a story the jedi would tell you.
10-11-2017T01:38:24,SageSaga,"ok so a team of adventures were walking down a path when the dungeon master said ""Up ahead you spot a Gazebo"""
10-11-2017T01:38:41,Bgrmystr2,xD..
10-11-2017T01:39:06,SageSaga,the played- unaware that a Gazebo is just a covered area to rest - assumed it was some kind of terrifying beast
10-11-2017T01:39:36,Bgrmystr2,Can confirm. Too convenient imo xD
10-11-2017T01:39:47,MidnightBlue78,everyone knows what a gazebo is

10-11-2017T01:41:38,unsteddyphoenix,Ahhh I see
10-11-2017T01:41:41,crimsonreaper,would it be ineffective if it was a flame arrow?
10-11-2017T01:41:56,unsteddyphoenix,But do you know the tale of Sir Bearington?
10-11-2017T01:42:02,Ordithus,"Gazebos do have an elemental weakness to fire, yes."
10-11-2017T01:42:02,Bgrmystr2,"""It's too late. You've awakened the Gazebo; it catches you and eats you."" Pffft :ptv-laugh:"
10-11-2017T01:42:07,SageSaga,the dread gazebo fears flames

10-11-2017T01:58:28,Twokinds,Yes
10-11-2017T01:58:35,Twokinds,"Well no, Sage streams forever"
10-11-2017T01:58:45,Dadrobit,"Yeah, he does that"
10-11-2017T01:59:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"its best to forget about sleeping when Sage streams, gonna be here for a bit"
10-11-2017T01:59:27,Twokinds,Sage is a machine
10-11-2017T01:59:35,Dadrobit,"If that gif girl had Shakeweights, she'd be jacked as hell by now!"
10-11-2017T01:59:45,FoxxTrotter,Sleep? What's that? ;0P
10-11-2017T01:59:52,Bgrmystr2,":thinking: I dunno tom, you're pretty machine too"
10-11-2017T02:00:11,Twokinds,I tire easily.
10-11-2017T02:00:43,Twokinds,I am a machine with a rechargable battery that's getting on in years
10-11-2017T02:00:50,Bgrmystr2,Awwh
10-11-2017T02:00:55,SageSaga,IM OLDER
10-11-2017T02:00:57,Dadrobit,lol

10-11-2017T02:01:03,Twokinds,Old Man Sage
10-11-2017T02:01:05,Bgrmystr2,"Btw I did save that page 1000 explosion, tom. xD"
10-11-2017T02:01:11,SageSaga,you darn kids!
10-11-2017T02:01:12,Ordithus,nice

10-11-2017T02:01:14,Bgrmystr2,"if you, yknow, wanted it for whatever reason :v"
10-11-2017T02:01:35,Twokinds,sh no spoilers
10-11-2017T02:01:47,Bgrmystr2,okay lololo
10-11-2017T02:01:53,MarvTheHugPharaoh,all the spoils
10-11-2017T02:02:19,Dadrobit,"Speaking of saving old pages, holy crap man, it took me forever to find the source image for the last Azuma Nora Card that just came out. Damn thing was buried."
10-11-2017T02:04:43,Dadrobit,"Azuma is definitely testing the boundaries of the ""old images"" stipulation. (Not that I mind all that much, I get a cool picture out of it:) )"
10-11-2017T02:04:56,SageSaga,i hit 2000 comics on wednesday
10-11-2017T02:05:03,Dadrobit,Congrats!
10-11-2017T02:05:06,Bgrmystr2,"aha I forgot I had that angry gazebo demotivational in my other tab, so when I went to find out what I forgot, the face gave me another laugh"
10-11-2017T02:05:12,MidnightBlue78,sweet!!!
10-11-2017T02:05:28,Bgrmystr2,Congratulations Sage :D
10-11-2017T02:05:37,FoxxTrotter,:0)
10-11-2017T02:05:55,DavidLikesArtSometimes,hears a binp in the night
10-11-2017T02:06:19,SageSaga,if we count filler and stuff-
10-11-2017T02:06:25,DavidLikesArtSometimes,knows what that means
10-11-2017T02:06:37,SageSaga,i think i hit 2k last year
10-11-2017T02:06:49,Dadrobit,Ha!
10-11-2017T02:07:08,MarvTheHugPharaoh,double anniversary
10-11-2017T02:07:50,SageSaga,Yosh doesnt have a good Anniversary date though because it had a weird start
10-11-2017T02:07:54,DavidLikesArtSometimes,My legs keep getting super sweaty but my feet are freezing
10-11-2017T02:08:14,SageSaga,long run on a forum- then transferred to an actual site months later
10-11-2017T02:08:36,SageSaga,"me asking Tom ""How's Comic Genesis as a host?"""
10-11-2017T02:08:54,Dadrobit,You could just arbitrarily set one? Like how people celebrate a pet's birthday without actually knowing the exact date?
10-11-2017T02:08:59,SageSaga,though at the time it was called Keen Space i think
10-11-2017T02:09:19,SageSaga,Kate's birthday was the 25th of October
10-11-2017T02:10:31,SageSaga,shes 22 years old- IRL
10-11-2017T02:11:24,Dadrobit,Perspective is a weird thing man.
10-11-2017T02:12:35,SageSaga,i created Kate when i was 10 years old- along with 2 other characters- one of those being Sage :P
10-11-2017T02:15:25,Dadrobit,"Like, I have a classmate who's only 17, Kate's got half a decade on her and she doesn't even know it."
10-11-2017T02:17:22,FoxxTrotter,"I'm off to bed. Thanks for the stream, Sage. G'night, everyone. :0)"
10-11-2017T02:17:31,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nighty night Foxx
10-11-2017T02:18:06,SageSaga,take care Foxx

10-11-2017T02:37:56,SageSaga,done
10-11-2017T02:38:07,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Very Nicely Done Sage

10-11-2017T02:41:03,DarthRexKing,Night!
10-11-2017T14:03:50,MidnightBlue78,:ctwokinds-rose:
10-11-2017T14:03:57,Dadrobit,Hey
10-11-2017T14:04:21,MidnightBlue78,hi~
10-11-2017T14:11:57,Twokinds,hoy
10-11-2017T14:15:48,MidnightBlue78,feeling better today Tom?
10-11-2017T14:16:42,Twokinds,I'm always better
10-11-2017T14:18:40,MidnightBlue78,:ctwokinds-karenOOO:
10-11-2017T14:18:52,SEOTheo,hey everyone
10-11-2017T14:19:16,TorqueEmUp,:ctorqueemup-26635:
10-11-2017T14:23:08,MidnightBlue78,"i'm feeling this cold weather slowly creeping in my life. Temp is 61, feels like 59 :ctwokinds-flomad:"
10-11-2017T14:24:02,MidnightBlue78,"Went outside, ran back inside. Aint nobody got time for that"
10-11-2017T14:25:34,TorqueEmUp,was 23F when I went to work this morning
10-11-2017T14:26:15,MidnightBlue78,cold makes me feel so miserable
10-11-2017T14:27:34,qwe304,would suggesting a sketch with maddies father in it be considered spoilers?
10-11-2017T14:29:08,MidnightBlue78,i really wanna know who was brave enough to impregante Adelaide
10-11-2017T14:29:29,MidnightBlue78,he deserves a whole comic to himself
10-11-2017T14:29:31,qwe304,^
10-11-2017T14:30:19,Dadrobit,"Lol, speaking of, Tom, any chance you've had a moment to give my side comic another thought?"
10-11-2017T14:55:37,Twokinds,Yeah
10-11-2017T14:56:06,Twokinds,I'd say the biggest issue I have with it is that you retconned that Maddie isn't Adelaide's biological daughter
10-11-2017T14:57:27,Dadrobit,"Hm, I figured it would make a rather good amount of sense. Very few physiological similarities, and being the Kingship is largely based around strength, the rigors of rearing a biological child would be disadvantagous."
10-11-2017T14:58:11,Dadrobit,"Though, I have long suspected that the real canonical father is Lynn :)"
10-11-2017T14:59:58,Dadrobit,"And being that the ending is so open to interpretation with the two books, I figure you could pretty easily just write it off as ""just a fiction she made up"" whenever you wanted to tackle the reality in the main canon."
10-11-2017T15:01:40,Dadrobit,"Since working off of manipulation is right there in her bio, it'd still make a fair amount of sense."
10-11-2017T15:02:04,Twokinds,I guess but a good lie is surrounded by a lot of truth
10-11-2017T15:02:26,Dadrobit,Hrmmm
10-11-2017T15:02:27,Twokinds,"And having so much of it be potentially fabricated, especially her biological relationship with he rmother"
10-11-2017T15:03:02,Twokinds,It'd just end up being a huge contradiction
10-11-2017T15:03:50,Twokinds,A major part of Mad's character is that she's a disappointment. She didn't live up to her mother's legend. She's small.
10-11-2017T15:07:07,Dadrobit,Really? She's not really portrayed as a disappointment as far as I can see? She was in on the trial sitting right next to the new generals. And pretty much anything she's attempted throughout the comic (like escaping capture or breaking from the brig) has
10-11-2017T15:07:12,Dadrobit,been successful.
10-11-2017T15:07:32,Dadrobit,The only failure afaik was the ship fire
10-11-2017T15:07:36,Twokinds,I'm not saying she is. That's just how a lot of Basitins see her.
10-11-2017T15:07:53,MidnightBlue78,i was just about to ask
10-11-2017T15:08:08,iliar,"Maddie isn't Adelaide's biological daughter?! In that case, I want to know. Does Adelaide have a husband?"
10-11-2017T15:08:09,Twokinds,They wanted another Adelaide.
10-11-2017T15:08:16,Twokinds,...
10-11-2017T15:08:16,MidnightBlue78,if she was a disappointment to her own mother or just to others
10-11-2017T15:08:57,MidnightBlue78,and you answered my question :)
10-11-2017T15:09:29,Twokinds,"Maddie doesn't allow it to show, but it causes a lot of angst and inspired her to be as different as possible."
10-11-2017T15:09:44,Twokinds,"Beacuse early on, everyone was sure she'd grow."
10-11-2017T15:09:52,Twokinds,A lot of pressure.
10-11-2017T15:10:04,Dadrobit,"Hmmm, okay, I think I can maybe work with that..."
10-11-2017T15:10:06,MidnightBlue78,"so, she's trying to prove herself to everyone? Thats why she left?"
10-11-2017T15:10:50,Twokinds,Yeah it's a big reason. She wanted to leave her mother's shadow.
10-11-2017T15:11:11,BadFoMo,What did I miss?
10-11-2017T15:12:01,Twokinds,"As you might have been able to tell, a lot of Basitin higher ups... are dicks."
10-11-2017T15:12:23,MidnightBlue78,"yep, straight up dicks xD"
10-11-2017T15:12:41,Dadrobit,"So skip the orphanage then. Go straight to the castle. Same story applies where she got good at evasion and hiding from the orphanage trainers, and have her do the same to her private trainer?"
10-11-2017T15:13:10,Twokinds,That might be fine. All the rest is good.
10-11-2017T15:14:15,Dadrobit,Any chance we could keep the Albion giving her the scar scene? I really kinda liked that detail
10-11-2017T15:15:16,Dadrobit,"Except it would be personal at that point. He catches her with the book, and takes out his anger at her not being her mother on her in the moment."
10-11-2017T15:15:48,Dadrobit,That sentence is a mess to read...
10-11-2017T15:19:51,Twokinds,lol
10-11-2017T15:19:54,Twokinds,sure'
10-11-2017T15:20:17,Twokinds,Though now Albion is just the scar giverer!
10-11-2017T15:20:40,Twokinds,"Everyone with a scar in the comic from now on, somehow it's Albion's fault!"
10-11-2017T15:20:58,Dadrobit,That's what I figured it would be. Like he has a thing for scratching at peoples eyes.
10-11-2017T15:21:03,Dadrobit,:D
10-11-2017T15:21:34,Dadrobit,"First Alaric and Maddie! And next, the World!"
10-11-2017T15:23:00,BadFoMo,Of Corse!
10-11-2017T15:27:13,Twokinds,It's also indirectly his fault Keith got his eye scar
10-11-2017T15:27:28,Dadrobit,Lol
10-11-2017T15:27:34,Twokinds,"...Man, Basitins have a thing for eye scars."
10-11-2017T15:27:57,Twokinds,"I think back then, I just really wanted to show that Basitins fight a lot. And that just translated to... lots of eye scars."
10-11-2017T15:28:57,Dadrobit,"I figured it was a logical choice when I noticed all the eye scars. Go for the eyes and your opponent can't rightly fight back. Not exactly the most honorable way to win, but whatever."
10-11-2017T15:29:12,Dadrobit,Albion wasn't the most honorable guy.
10-11-2017T15:33:11,BadFoMo,"//HeadCanon? He's only like that due to his oponinte hitting him in the gentelmen's area when he was a young man, and nobody called it out."
10-11-2017T15:44:10,BadFoMo,"//Troll While we are talking about side-comics, What did you think of the Blueberry one I sent in, Tom?"
10-11-2017T15:45:17,BadFoMo,Inb4 Tom: You are banned for sending in side-comic ideas.
10-11-2017T15:48:11,Dadrobit,lol
10-11-2017T15:56:31,qwe304,anyone here play fortnite?
10-11-2017T17:46:37,MidnightBlue78,"i don't know why, but I'm not getting twitter notifications when the comic is updated, and I have notifications on. It's so irritating :ctwokinds-flomad:"
10-11-2017T18:15:52,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-flomad:
10-11-2017T18:34:15,MidnightBlue78,i guess twitter hates me :ctwokinds-katwet:
10-11-2017T18:50:27,TorqueEmUp,The new page. &lt;3 ^^

10-11-2017T18:57:50,Twokinds,Young

10-11-2017T18:58:41,unsteddyphoenix,Or keidran
10-11-2017T18:58:46,unsteddyphoenix,Shes actually 7
