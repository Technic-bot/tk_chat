26-10-2017T20:01:09,MaxHernandez,Its time
26-10-2017T20:01:45,Walphin,:0
26-10-2017T20:03:34,TorqueEmUp,"It may be time, but there is a distinct lack of a Tom in our midst."
26-10-2017T20:03:40,TorqueEmUp,:P
26-10-2017T20:03:47,Dadrobit,It happens
26-10-2017T20:03:54,TorqueEmUp,yup
26-10-2017T20:04:12,TorqueEmUp,I'll just play some more Mario Odyessey
26-10-2017T20:04:16,Serpentfrog,But nobody came...
26-10-2017T20:05:05,Dadrobit,Are people still obsessing over that game?
26-10-2017T20:05:38,TorqueEmUp,"It literally JUST came out today, so what do you mean ""still""? :P"
26-10-2017T20:05:41,BluePhantom90,nope
26-10-2017T20:05:53,Dadrobit,"Serpent, I mean."
26-10-2017T20:06:29,MaxHernandez,Lol
26-10-2017T20:07:01,Serpentfrog,I am not allowed to reference games that are still relevant. Got it.
26-10-2017T20:07:04,TorqueEmUp,ahhh Undertale XP didn't quite catch that
26-10-2017T20:07:35,MaxHernandez,:ptv-unimpressed:
26-10-2017T20:07:40,Dadrobit,Only thing I know about Mario Odyssey is that it has Mario in the name and The Living Tombstone made a pretty legit song for it.
26-10-2017T20:07:49,MaxHernandez,Ikr
26-10-2017T20:08:34,Dadrobit,"Sorry, was never a fan of Untertale. The whole thing was very overblown imo."
26-10-2017T20:08:45,Dadrobit,Undertale*
26-10-2017T20:09:09,unsteddyphoenix,But you got that fairly obscure reference :thinking:
26-10-2017T20:09:11,unsteddyphoenix,I had to google that
26-10-2017T20:09:20,Serpentfrog,So obscure.
26-10-2017T20:09:58,unsteddyphoenix,"I should probably watch someone play it, I feel like it's good but I couldnt really get into it."
26-10-2017T20:10:09,Dadrobit,Watched the Game Grumps Steam Train genocide run.
26-10-2017T20:10:24,unsteddyphoenix,"Ahh, theyre not bad"
26-10-2017T20:10:27,unsteddyphoenix,Might hit that up
26-10-2017T20:10:34,Dadrobit,Good times were had.
26-10-2017T20:10:47,Walphin,Anyone like Halo 3?

26-10-2017T20:11:17,Dadrobit,Thought there was a spaghetti conspiracy for a sec there.
26-10-2017T20:11:19,Walphin,halo 3 is probably my favorite halo game
26-10-2017T20:11:25,Serpentfrog,"'Ello, Marv."
26-10-2017T20:11:31,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Ello
26-10-2017T20:11:33,TorqueEmUp,I watched one of the Steamtrain playthroughs as well
26-10-2017T20:11:34,unsteddyphoenix,If pizza can have one the spaghetti is inevitable
26-10-2017T20:11:47,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Halo 3 is way up there for me, but nothing can overtake Jak and Daxter"
26-10-2017T20:12:04,unsteddyphoenix,Halo 1 only great halo desu
26-10-2017T20:12:06,BadFoMo,@Walphin I'm waiting for a PC port to come to steam.

26-10-2017T20:12:45,TorqueEmUp,"Halo 1 honestly I think was one of the weakest, but that just IMHO."
26-10-2017T20:12:57,Dadrobit,Only ever played the first Halo.
26-10-2017T20:12:58,Kinipshun,howdy tom
26-10-2017T20:13:00,Serpentfrog,"Quick, eveyone tell him he's late so he knows."
26-10-2017T20:13:01,Walphin,"I'd agree, but damn Halo 1's pistol was beast."
26-10-2017T20:13:03,unsteddyphoenix,How dare you disagree with the general nostalgia
26-10-2017T20:13:15,unsteddyphoenix,Fall in line!
26-10-2017T20:13:20,BadFoMo,@Dadrobit Same.
26-10-2017T20:13:28,TorqueEmUp,Halo 1 had way too many boring corridors that all looked the same. lol
26-10-2017T20:13:37,Bgrmystr2,I still rather prefer Halo 1 the most out of all the series.
26-10-2017T20:13:43,unsteddyphoenix,Ayyy gettem goons!

26-10-2017T20:22:32,unsteddyphoenix,"Like, walking them on the street and shit."
26-10-2017T20:22:37,Dadrobit,Lol

26-10-2017T20:23:00,Bgrmystr2,where did she get that idea from..?
26-10-2017T20:23:10,unsteddyphoenix,She saw the statistic that is like
26-10-2017T20:23:14,Bgrmystr2,I'd be more surprised if you DID
26-10-2017T20:23:16,unsteddyphoenix,we have 7 sheep per person here
26-10-2017T20:23:28,Kinipshun,10/10 on that emote
26-10-2017T20:23:32,OwenStarr,^
26-10-2017T20:23:46,Bgrmystr2,"the blank one, Kinip? Yeah can agree."
26-10-2017T20:24:00,unsteddyphoenix,"Obviously we only have pet lambs, then we give them away fully grown normally theyre so messy"

26-10-2017T20:24:23,Bgrmystr2,no Dadro lol
26-10-2017T20:24:25,Bgrmystr2,xD
26-10-2017T20:24:34,Bgrmystr2,qwe posts blank emotes all the time
26-10-2017T20:24:59,Bgrmystr2,"I've seen it quite a few times now, not sure if accidentally or just troll :thinking:"
26-10-2017T20:25:00,MidnightBlue78,i've already gotten used to them
26-10-2017T20:25:21,Dadrobit,"Seen it before, but ignored it usually."
26-10-2017T20:25:24,Dadrobit,This time tho
26-10-2017T20:25:27,Dadrobit,It got to me
26-10-2017T20:25:32,Serpentfrog,What is the point of a blank emote? I feel like that is very philisophical.
26-10-2017T20:25:49,Dadrobit,I think it points to the duality of man
26-10-2017T20:25:59,Bgrmystr2,why would you refresh though? I just don't understand the decision
26-10-2017T20:26:15,Bgrmystr2,the fact that you can see the emote means it already loaded
26-10-2017T20:26:19,unsteddyphoenix,"By posting a blank emote, he's actually referring to the lack of emotion he feels and his general listlessness in his day to day life."
26-10-2017T20:26:27,Bgrmystr2,"if it never loads the emote, the message wouldn't be that big"
26-10-2017T20:26:30,Bgrmystr2,and the line would be blank
26-10-2017T20:26:48,unsteddyphoenix,"Qwe, if you ever want to talk..."
26-10-2017T20:26:56,Dadrobit,"Bgr, my ass is nowhere near lubed up enough for how up it you truly are right now."

26-10-2017T20:30:31,Serpentfrog,Yes.
26-10-2017T20:30:33,Dadrobit,Depends on the phase of the moon I think

26-10-2017T22:24:29,BluePhantom90,you know tom. We know a little about that Seraphina and how she got that dragon like abilities. I mean from the sounds of it she kinda dose something like in D&D of dragon worshiping
26-10-2017T22:24:43,Bgrmystr2,"hmm.. :thinking: refreshing the page, the player opens but then immediately crashes"

26-10-2017T22:25:08,nearbyeclipse,picarto runs an ad
26-10-2017T22:25:19,nearbyeclipse,and then i get the loading wheel and a preview
26-10-2017T22:25:22,Vixxystix,:< streams won't load
26-10-2017T22:25:30,SageSaga,you shouldnt get an ad on mine

26-10-2017T22:26:06,nearbyeclipse,well picarto ran one for you anyway
26-10-2017T22:26:18,Bgrmystr2,perhaps that's what is breaking the videos?
26-10-2017T22:26:35,unsteddyphoenix,Picarto forcing ads through
26-10-2017T22:26:51,Twokinds,"Like tattoos and body mods irl, getting magically modified isn't unheard of in the Twokinds world, though it is considered deviant behavior."
26-10-2017T22:26:54,nearbyeclipse,but yeah 3 min of loading wheel and no progress
26-10-2017T22:27:06,nearbyeclipse,refreshed both the browser and chrome and no improvement

26-10-2017T22:27:42,nearbyeclipse,time to find pikachu i guess
26-10-2017T22:27:44,unsteddyphoenix,I assume like
26-10-2017T22:27:47,Ordithus,"With her Keidran ears, that is"
26-10-2017T22:27:51,unsteddyphoenix,Akidrasts are the most extreme examples?
26-10-2017T22:27:53,unsteddyphoenix,of modding
26-10-2017T22:28:14,Bgrmystr2,"isn't that one of the picarto devs, @nearbyeclipse?"

26-10-2017T22:29:56,Ordithus,People must think that Karen is pretty odd.

26-10-2017T23:21:15,BadFoMo,"How about The Trace's place being a Hounted House atraction with him, Rose and (Pumpkin belly) Flora handing out candy while Zen and Raine are inside about to be scaired by Maeve dressed as a Ghost and Maddie dressed as a Were-Squirral?"
26-10-2017T23:21:47,Bgrmystr2,"well, Kam, beyond the mainstay team of different people who play in different ways"
26-10-2017T23:21:58,w0lfmare,Can the rest of Flora be Flowey?
26-10-2017T23:22:15,Bgrmystr2,Floray? ;v
26-10-2017T23:22:40,Bgrmystr2,"Dunno, doesn't really.. flow all that well"
26-10-2017T23:22:41,Kamaro12,bgr: you could literally say that about any team-based class shooter
26-10-2017T23:23:13,Mihari,"LIke that game you press left click on to do something, or press a button on your controller to do another!"
26-10-2017T23:23:24,Kullax,Hehe. I like this Sage
26-10-2017T23:23:25,Kamaro12,lol
26-10-2017T23:23:28,Ordithus,I love that one
26-10-2017T23:23:29,Unenlagia,Overwatch has a lot more in the terms of character variety and integrating ability cooldowns like a MOBA
26-10-2017T23:23:40,Bgrmystr2,"perhaps, but how many of them are based the rocket-jumping type of gameplay that the original Unreal Tournement did?"
26-10-2017T23:23:46,Bgrmystr2,not many.
26-10-2017T23:23:58,Kamaro12,enough to still make it not very clear what you're referring to :P
26-10-2017T23:24:00,BadFoMo,What's Sage doing?
26-10-2017T23:24:15,Kullax,A Halloween pic
26-10-2017T23:24:16,Unenlagia,"But map variety, game mods, and customization is lacking behind it's peers"
26-10-2017T23:24:17,Bgrmystr2,They're also very old and much past their hayday
26-10-2017T23:24:26,Kamaro12,"and yeah, cooldowns on abilities seem to be overwatch's answer to TF2's different weapon loadouts"
26-10-2017T23:24:37,Kamaro12,or just abilities in general I mean
26-10-2017T23:25:14,Kamaro12,"I honestly don't think ""rocket jump"" shooters are obsolete though"
26-10-2017T23:25:29,Kamaro12,"Overwatch does sound fun in some ways, but it also just sounds like a shooter MOBA"
26-10-2017T23:25:31,Bgrmystr2,TF2 is really the only one that still stands as a known name of that type.
26-10-2017T23:26:03,Bgrmystr2,even though it is pretty old now
26-10-2017T23:26:16,Kamaro12,"and there aren't any loadouts that you can do with the characters, right?"
26-10-2017T23:26:52,Bgrmystr2,There aren't any that I know of.
26-10-2017T23:27:03,Unenlagia,In Overwatch the character's kits are static
26-10-2017T23:27:07,Bgrmystr2,I've been into Torchlight 2 for the past week or so
26-10-2017T23:27:08,Kamaro12,gotcha
26-10-2017T23:27:50,Unenlagia,The only one that can change at the moment is Symmetra who has a choice of two ultimate abilities
26-10-2017T23:29:10,Unenlagia,And Overwatch isn't the first to do this kind of gameplay by far.
26-10-2017T23:29:40,Unenlagia,"But benefited greatly from a striking visual style, just as TF2 did back in the day."
26-10-2017T23:29:45,Bgrmystr2,it's definitely in the same genre for sure.
26-10-2017T23:30:24,BadFoMo,Tom: And let's just add a happy little Dragon over there.
26-10-2017T23:30:32,Bgrmystr2,xDD
26-10-2017T23:30:42,Bgrmystr2,pretty sure that's the bigass dragon statue in the mountains
26-10-2017T23:30:46,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"and another one here, because everyone needs a friend"
26-10-2017T23:30:50,SpotTheLeopard,lol
26-10-2017T23:30:51,Kamaro12,now I'm just thinking of that Bob Ross remix that PBS Digital made
26-10-2017T23:31:04,MaxHernandez,Lol
26-10-2017T23:31:45,BadFoMo,I didn't bother trying to spell 'statue'.
26-10-2017T23:31:46,missjessicadawn,"I'm gonna head to bed, gotta be at work early... Have a good night, guys! Thanks for streaming! :-)"
26-10-2017T23:31:56,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nighty night Jess :ctwokinds-nibsbounce:
26-10-2017T23:32:00,FoxxTrotter,"G'night, Jess."
26-10-2017T23:32:03,Bgrmystr2,gnight jess
26-10-2017T23:32:16,BadFoMo,"Wait, there's more than one of them?"
26-10-2017T23:32:25,Serpentfrog,Sleep well. :ctwokinds-RainezZz:
26-10-2017T23:32:29,Bgrmystr2,"well, everyone has their things their good at"
26-10-2017T23:32:30,Sammit,bye Jess
26-10-2017T23:32:41,Bgrmystr2,"whenTom draws nature, he channels his inner Bob Ross"
26-10-2017T23:32:58,Bgrmystr2,;v
26-10-2017T23:34:16,Serpentfrog,Bob Ross channels his inner Tom.
26-10-2017T23:34:51,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Bob Ross channels his inner bathtub alligator
26-10-2017T23:36:37,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-confused: wait what
26-10-2017T23:36:44,Bgrmystr2,marv are you sure you're not drunk
26-10-2017T23:36:47,Bgrmystr2,have you been drinking?
26-10-2017T23:36:57,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Bob Ross kept a alligator in his parents bathtub
26-10-2017T23:37:15,BadFoMo,For real?
26-10-2017T23:37:18,MarvTheHugPharaoh,yep
26-10-2017T23:37:24,Bgrmystr2,.. not joking are you
26-10-2017T23:37:30,MarvTheHugPharaoh,no joke
26-10-2017T23:37:31,Bgrmystr2,xD what even
26-10-2017T23:37:41,Bgrmystr2,was it real

26-10-2017T23:37:48,Bgrmystr2,holyshit man
26-10-2017T23:38:15,Bgrmystr2,there are some things.. I just do not want to know the answer to
26-10-2017T23:38:18,Bgrmystr2,but why
26-10-2017T23:38:22,Bgrmystr2,..why?
26-10-2017T23:38:28,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"it was injured so he took it home to care for it, until it healed up"
26-10-2017T23:38:46,Bgrmystr2,a wild gator
26-10-2017T23:38:51,MarvTheHugPharaoh,yes
26-10-2017T23:38:58,Bgrmystr2,he is insane
26-10-2017T23:39:14,MarvTheHugPharaoh,he also had a armadillo  who ran around the house
26-10-2017T23:39:16,Bgrmystr2,rather a gator than a croc
26-10-2017T23:39:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"a Gator will mess up up, a croc will eat ya"
26-10-2017T23:39:50,Bgrmystr2,yeah
26-10-2017T23:40:07,Bgrmystr2,we have a lot of crocs around here
26-10-2017T23:40:13,Bgrmystr2,"NOT your friend, lemmy tell ya"
26-10-2017T23:40:15,Twokinds,He had a squirrel!
26-10-2017T23:40:27,MarvTheHugPharaoh,yep
26-10-2017T23:40:30,CrimsonHelsing,Who?

26-10-2017T23:40:34,MarvTheHugPharaoh,bob ross
26-10-2017T23:40:38,Unenlagia,Oh is that where the fixation came from Tom?
26-10-2017T23:40:46,Bgrmystr2,"probably not, Unen"
26-10-2017T23:40:53,MarvTheHugPharaoh,squirrels are just awesome
26-10-2017T23:41:11,Unenlagia,I was being facetious
26-10-2017T23:41:23,Bgrmystr2,it's ok
26-10-2017T23:41:27,Bgrmystr2,I chose to ignore it :D
26-10-2017T23:45:03,MarvTheHugPharaoh,That looks awesome Sage :D
26-10-2017T23:46:05,Unenlagia,Agreed
26-10-2017T23:47:22,BadFoMo,Still the Halloween art?

26-10-2017T23:49:10,SageSaga,"Thanksgiving is the warden, holding the Christmas at bay to protect Halloween"
26-10-2017T23:49:11,Serpentfrog,Canada.
26-10-2017T23:49:23,SageSaga,or perhaps- to protect Christmas- FROM HALLOWEEN
26-10-2017T23:49:30,Bgrmystr2,lolo
26-10-2017T23:49:44,Bgrmystr2,Canada celebrates Thanksgiving?

26-10-2017T23:49:52,unsteddyphoenix,Really?

26-10-2017T23:50:05,BadFoMo,"""What's this? What's this?!"""

26-10-2017T23:52:26,BluePhantom90,SO I guess Dragons are sensitive at the end of their tails

26-10-2017T23:55:02,Bgrmystr2,>;v
26-10-2017T23:55:03,SageSaga,The important thing to remember about Columbus is he didnt do half the things people say he did and hes a total bag of dicks for the things most people dont know about him
26-10-2017T23:55:05,unsteddyphoenix,It is the only thing that means anything
26-10-2017T23:55:21,MarvTheHugPharaoh,@SageSaga true
26-10-2017T23:55:24,unsteddyphoenix,Surely most people know that about Columbus by now
26-10-2017T23:55:32,unsteddyphoenix,It was a big deal a while ago
26-10-2017T23:55:42,SageSaga,they still teach kids about him in schools
26-10-2017T23:55:52,Bgrmystr2,I literally was only ever taught ONE thing in school of Columbus.
26-10-2017T23:55:53,SageSaga,and not the murder parts
26-10-2017T23:55:56,Bgrmystr2,One thing ever.
