22-10-2017T20:55:56,LeKnightWolf,i have a question for all of you in the chat.
22-10-2017T20:56:04,BluePhantom90,yes?
22-10-2017T20:57:38,LeKnightWolf,Would you consider time more valuable or life choices(the decisions you make/what your response to something is)?
22-10-2017T20:58:09,BluePhantom90,that is a good question
22-10-2017T20:58:54,LeKnightWolf,it just popped in my head so i figured i might as well let it see where it leads me.
22-10-2017T21:00:03,BluePhantom90,hmm I think Choices.
22-10-2017T21:00:10,Sammit,same here

22-10-2017T21:01:48,LeKnightWolf,:worried::pensive:I desire so much yet this thing has me put in a box.
22-10-2017T21:04:37,BluePhantom90,hmm
22-10-2017T21:05:06,LeKnightWolf,:grin:that thing is me..:unamused:
22-10-2017T21:07:18,LeKnightWolf,:neutral_face:say how much longer do you think we(humans) will live?
22-10-2017T21:07:31,Sammit,humans or humanity?
22-10-2017T21:07:47,LeKnightWolf,humans.
22-10-2017T21:08:18,LeKnightWolf,:smirk:age is such a stupid thing.
22-10-2017T21:09:21,LeKnightWolf,:grimacing:nah. i believe i need to elaborate that better.
22-10-2017T21:18:16,Sammit,Is hard to find the words when the ideas are complex
22-10-2017T21:24:36,LeKnightWolf,you can't give a definition to the thing you don't know.
22-10-2017T22:01:54,Bgrmystr2,"I don't think so, Knight. I commonly encounter situations where I can describe or define something I am looking for, yet not be able to put my finger on what exactly it is that I am looking for."
22-10-2017T22:29:42,LeKnightWolf,well
22-10-2017T22:31:30,LeKnightWolf,"i'll be back tomorrow, farewell for now."
