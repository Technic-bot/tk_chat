17-12-2017T00:18:51,TheBeckoner,Its been good so far but since I bought it on disc its currently downloading like 13 gigs of stuff
17-12-2017T00:22:38,Dadrobit,"Stream Kitteh, Lap Panther, Nyx. All these names and more are hers."
17-12-2017T00:22:48,Dadrobit,And she acknowledges none of them.
17-12-2017T00:27:30,MidnightBlue78,"well guys, I'm off to bed..."
17-12-2017T00:27:48,Combak,Night Midnight!
17-12-2017T00:27:51,MidnightBlue78,good night :ctwokinds-rainehappy:
17-12-2017T00:30:37,Combak,"Hey Tom, do you mind if I ask you a few questions? I want to make sure I'm understanding the whole Masks thing correctly."
17-12-2017T00:30:46,Twokinds,I guess so?
17-12-2017T00:32:21,Combak,"So, do they had a race they support? Or are they more representatives of their name?"
17-12-2017T00:32:56,Combak,"I THINK you said during a stream they were more representatives of their name, but I could be mis-remembering things."
17-12-2017T00:33:02,Dadrobit,Night Midnight
17-12-2017T00:36:06,Twokinds,"They started out supporting one of each race, but they're goals are just what they symbolize."
17-12-2017T00:44:53,Combak,"Ah, I see!"
17-12-2017T00:45:12,Combak,"Wait, so you mean historically or your idea of them?"
17-12-2017T00:48:47,Twokinds,The first one
17-12-2017T00:49:37,unsteddyphoenix,"They So they have like, a vague affection for their race but ultimately want to further their own goals?"
17-12-2017T00:49:43,unsteddyphoenix,Thats the way I figured it
17-12-2017T00:50:11,TheBeckoner,^ sounds good to me
17-12-2017T00:50:36,unsteddyphoenix,"Chaos is the ""human"" mask and order is the ""basitin"" mask, right?"
17-12-2017T00:50:57,Twokinds,yes
17-12-2017T00:51:39,unsteddyphoenix,Is there any particular reason one of the masks seemed to be a wolf in the sketch you drew?
17-12-2017T00:51:43,TheBeckoner,"Those both fit pretty well, I haven't really given much thought to the masks."
17-12-2017T00:51:45,unsteddyphoenix,Since it wasnt ephemeral
17-12-2017T00:57:26,Twokinds,I don't know what sketch you mean
17-12-2017T01:03:24,Combak,I'm guessing the one with Nora and a mask? Nora messing with early humans or something.

17-12-2017T01:13:14,unsteddyphoenix,This one
17-12-2017T01:13:24,unsteddyphoenix,The one on the left looks doggoish?
17-12-2017T01:13:57,Combak,... I think you're just seeing a shadowy bit of it's hood as an ear.
17-12-2017T01:14:58,unsteddyphoenix,might be right
17-12-2017T01:19:35,Twokinds,"Yeah, not my intention."
17-12-2017T01:19:51,Dadrobit,Order lookin' tight.
17-12-2017T01:22:05,Bgrmystr2,is that a tear for Order?
17-12-2017T01:22:09,Bgrmystr2,or is that a crack?
17-12-2017T01:22:12,Bgrmystr2,looks like a tear though
17-12-2017T01:22:47,unsteddyphoenix,Looks like a scar
17-12-2017T01:23:01,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
17-12-2017T01:24:06,iliar,"Okay, Tom. I want to know if the Lady Nora so powerful enough to change mask's gender?"
17-12-2017T01:31:03,Combak,Do the Masks even have a gender in the first place?
17-12-2017T01:37:11,Twokinds,lol
17-12-2017T01:37:38,Twokinds,"They don't have gender to begin with, and even if they did, no."
17-12-2017T01:37:51,iliar,"It doesn't matter. If after a meeting with Nora they will have gender, it does count too!"
17-12-2017T01:38:54,Combak,The Masks are on a whole 'nother power level above Nora. So probably not.
17-12-2017T01:39:45,Bgrmystr2,"that's to be expected, honestly"
17-12-2017T01:40:20,Dadrobit,"Even if they did, would they not hide it behind a mask?"
17-12-2017T01:40:32,Dadrobit,Seems like the thing to do.
17-12-2017T01:42:37,TheBeckoner,Because if people find out you're a boy or girl in twokinds... YOU DIE
17-12-2017T01:47:07,ElvenHunter84,Will there be a stream next Sunday with it being Christmas Eve and all
17-12-2017T01:51:37,KuroganeWatanoshi,darn I missed the stream

17-12-2017T02:32:28,unsteddyphoenix,Seriously it happens WAY too often
17-12-2017T02:36:54,Dadrobit,"Huh, turns out one of my professors is a bit of a night owl. Just checked my email and I got a message from him only a couple minutes ago."
17-12-2017T02:37:29,Dadrobit,Time received: 00:27
17-12-2017T02:37:46,TheBeckoner,"ooh that reminds me, I need to check my math grade"
17-12-2017T02:38:41,KuroganeWatanoshi,@unsteddyphoenix yeah xD
17-12-2017T02:39:10,Dadrobit,Email reminding me that I need to pick out a video to use for next semester (preferably) before the semester starts .
17-12-2017T02:40:09,Dadrobit,Anyone got any cool 5-9 minute videos/animations?
17-12-2017T02:47:27,TheBeckoner,Yes. This one is my favorite. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgGzAKP_HuM
17-12-2017T02:47:40,TheBeckoner,although you probably cant use it like you'll want to
17-12-2017T02:48:00,TheBeckoner,I just like it :ptv-hearts:
17-12-2017T02:48:48,Dadrobit,No. No that is definitely not acceptable.
17-12-2017T02:49:05,TheBeckoner,lol I figured
17-12-2017T02:51:06,TheBeckoner,Is there a list of requirements?
17-12-2017T02:54:09,Dadrobit,"cool video, 5-9 minutes long, some narration for dialogue training, but not drowning in it."
17-12-2017T02:54:28,TheBeckoner,hmm ok
17-12-2017T02:55:25,Dadrobit,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_XwzBMTJaM was the video I used last semester.
17-12-2017T02:56:12,Dadrobit,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XNo5andfho was what it became
17-12-2017T02:57:12,Dadrobit,Need something that I can work with and move forward with to show off to studios and get jobs with.
17-12-2017T02:57:28,Dadrobit,"""With"" overload"
17-12-2017T02:58:10,TheBeckoner,I like yours much better
17-12-2017T02:58:31,TheBeckoner,"I may have a video that will work, will WW2 stuff work?"
17-12-2017T02:58:42,TheBeckoner,I mean its not my video of course
17-12-2017T03:00:30,Dadrobit,"Uhhh, maybe?"
17-12-2017T03:00:43,Dadrobit,"Also, ty."
17-12-2017T03:01:12,Dadrobit,"Still think it could have been better w/ another week or two of work, but whatever, it is what it is."
17-12-2017T03:01:43,KuroganeWatanoshi,wow I am so tired
17-12-2017T03:05:05,TheBeckoner,Dang Im having a hard time finding something that doesnt have music all over it
17-12-2017T03:05:35,Dadrobit,Doesn't matter. I don't use any of the stock audio. Everything is replaced.
17-12-2017T03:06:14,Dadrobit,"All we bring to class is the video, the rest we have to make up."
17-12-2017T03:08:35,TheBeckoner,"Oh, ok then well here's a few War Thunder trailers. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzgPXOw2plI"

17-12-2017T03:08:49,TheBeckoner,I guess When I said a few I meant two
17-12-2017T03:08:57,TheBeckoner,I personally like the first one
17-12-2017T03:12:04,Dadrobit,"Waaay too short. Cool, but short."
17-12-2017T03:12:19,TheBeckoner,yeah I figured that...hmmm
