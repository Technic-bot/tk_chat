01-12-2017T02:27:37,unsteddyphoenix,Im not sure I can be friends with someone like that
01-12-2017T02:27:40,Dadrobit,Spent most of the stream making money :)
01-12-2017T02:28:44,Dadrobit,"Though, I think Tom made a bit more lol."
01-12-2017T02:28:52,unsteddyphoenix,lol
01-12-2017T02:28:54,MarvTheHugPharaoh,lol
01-12-2017T02:29:28,unsteddyphoenix,Maybe.
01-12-2017T02:29:53,unsteddyphoenix,Screw both of you and your respective talents.
01-12-2017T02:30:21,unsteddyphoenix,Punish excellence

01-12-2017T02:31:06,Serpentfrog,"Stalinist, tyvm."
01-12-2017T02:31:33,Dadrobit,"No, pretty sure he made more, only made $150 off that gig. Commercial work. Just a quick buck."
01-12-2017T02:32:07,Serpentfrog,But we get to hear your voice for free. What a bargain!
01-12-2017T02:32:16,Dadrobit,GG
01-12-2017T02:32:22,unsteddyphoenix,A steal one might say
01-12-2017T02:32:27,Dadrobit,I need to start charging y'all.
01-12-2017T02:32:33,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
01-12-2017T02:33:06,Serpentfrog,"Do you know what it says about you if you read the things you read for us for money, you giggolo?"
01-12-2017T02:33:42,Dadrobit,"As long as I get called daddy at the end, I don't care."
01-12-2017T02:33:49,Serpentfrog,Hot.
01-12-2017T02:33:52,MarvTheHugPharaoh,amazing
01-12-2017T02:34:14,MidnightBlue78,:ctwokinds-MikeLewd:
01-12-2017T02:34:30,MidnightBlue78,ehehehe
01-12-2017T02:34:55,unsteddyphoenix,~correct answer~
01-12-2017T02:57:41,Dinoman515,You guys are still here..?
01-12-2017T02:57:49,MarvTheHugPharaoh,nah
01-12-2017T02:57:55,Dadrobit,What else would we do?
01-12-2017T03:06:10,Twokinds,I'm trying to come up with a way to create a gallery for the Patreon
01-12-2017T03:06:34,unsteddyphoenix,A gallery?
01-12-2017T03:06:38,Dadrobit,Within patreon? Or like a subsection of DA?
01-12-2017T03:06:45,Twokinds,So people can see thumbnails of all the sketches without having to scroll down down down.
01-12-2017T03:06:58,Twokinds,But that's gunna be a lot of work with almost 300 links.
01-12-2017T03:07:04,MarvTheHugPharaoh,can you do that on Patreon?
01-12-2017T03:07:11,Dadrobit,"Yeah, Patreon kinda sucks for that."
01-12-2017T03:07:12,Twokinds,No but I could make one myself.
01-12-2017T03:07:18,unsteddyphoenix,Ahh
01-12-2017T03:07:40,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah I cant really see a way that doesnt involve an absurd amount of work
01-12-2017T03:08:01,unsteddyphoenix,Which sucks 'cause patreons search function is awful too~
01-12-2017T03:09:37,iliar,"Well, I can't quite understand what you mean. But I think I can create little python script which can help you."
01-12-2017T03:10:11,unsteddyphoenix,You can do that without understand what he means? Impressive~
01-12-2017T03:10:26,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"what are you, Magic?"
01-12-2017T03:12:09,unsteddyphoenix,Hmm so we have 20 sketches to choose from this month. More than I thought!
01-12-2017T03:12:17,unsteddyphoenix,"I forgot about the seers daughter one, hope that gets in"
01-12-2017T03:12:36,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"same, that one would be a awesome desktop wallpaper"
01-12-2017T03:13:27,Dadrobit,"I really, really hope Seer's daughter wins a vote."
01-12-2017T03:13:52,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"It would be cool to see""Lights on the mountain""  get colored aswell"
01-12-2017T03:14:25,unsteddyphoenix,The masks too while we're at it
01-12-2017T03:14:34,unsteddyphoenix,Hit me with some atmosphere~
01-12-2017T03:15:18,iliar,@unsteddyphoenix Because I have already done few python script for Patreon. And I think not will be hard edit one of them for Tom's request.
01-12-2017T03:16:19,unsteddyphoenix,Hoo~ maybe youve already done what he wants then?
01-12-2017T03:16:54,iliar,@Twokinds  Could you please explain in more detail what you want to do.
01-12-2017T03:17:15,Bgrmystr2,He wants a gallery like you would see on deviantart or furaffinity
01-12-2017T03:17:18,Bgrmystr2,but on patreon
01-12-2017T03:17:30,Bgrmystr2,so people don't have to scroll down to infinity to see the older images
01-12-2017T03:18:42,Bgrmystr2,https://twokinds.deviantart.com/gallery/ This kind of setup shows many images using thumbnails and has several pages where you can just click on the image and go to the post immediately
01-12-2017T03:18:58,Dadrobit,Mastodon- Alseep in the Deep has one of the oddest music videos I've seen in a good long while.
01-12-2017T03:19:03,Dadrobit,Just sayin'
01-12-2017T03:19:24,Bgrmystr2,Patreon doesn't have that kind of gallery design as a feature.
01-12-2017T03:19:43,iliar,"@unsteddyphoenix Probably not. I created scripts for my tasks. For example, I created a script that automatically sends notifications to my community when Tom publishes a new art."
01-12-2017T03:19:59,unsteddyphoenix,I like mastodon
01-12-2017T03:20:20,unsteddyphoenix,Thanks for reminding me about them I should hit them up
01-12-2017T03:20:29,unsteddyphoenix,Aw there's a cat in this video big fan
01-12-2017T03:22:21,Dadrobit,lol
01-12-2017T08:54:45,RandomTKLover,wonders why nobody is talking.

01-12-2017T14:19:49,Dinoman515,OwO
01-12-2017T14:38:49,Dadrobit,She retired and moved out here. She just travels to see relatives that don't live in AZ.
01-12-2017T14:39:25,Dadrobit,Spent a month or so in NY with my aunt who's still out there.
01-12-2017T15:04:11,eric190,yo
01-12-2017T15:05:17,SageSaga,yo - starting soon- just gotta take care of some stuff real quick

01-12-2017T15:12:10,SageSaga,alright
01-12-2017T15:13:16,ZoieFalcona,awww... Blue look like she needs a long hug
01-12-2017T15:13:37,Mihari,Blue?
01-12-2017T15:13:57,ZoieFalcona,"Well, she reminds me a lot of Blue... sorry :/"
01-12-2017T15:14:53,Mihari,"Kinda missing out in key features to make that, unless your solely looking at very basic hair design. XD"
01-12-2017T15:15:21,ZoieFalcona,&gt;.&lt;
01-12-2017T15:16:07,FoxxTrotter,^_^

01-12-2017T15:34:10,ZoieFalcona,And here we see in the studio the green sceen where we will be doing our background effects on soon!
01-12-2017T15:39:34,Bgrmystr2,xD

01-12-2017T15:50:48,SageSaga,that emote looks weird

01-12-2017T15:52:55,ZoieFalcona,Well... dunno any that's better for being embarassed

01-12-2017T15:56:12,ZoieFalcona,:ptv-scratch:
01-12-2017T16:04:05,Bgrmystr2,"So I guess as soon as Nyna heard the term ""adventurer"" she bugged out"
01-12-2017T16:06:40,SageSaga,"well - if you were in a fight with a person who was clearly very strong and probably outmatched you and you asked who they were and they said ""*Enter name of worlds greatest fighter*"" and you suddenly realized- that might be the truth- what would you do?"
01-12-2017T16:07:40,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: As if it isn't obvious
01-12-2017T16:07:56,Bgrmystr2,Clearly do battle with the greatest fighter of all time :D
01-12-2017T16:08:02,Bgrmystr2,clearly.
01-12-2017T16:08:51,SageSaga,ok - this greatest fighter is also known for executing every single one of his opponents to the point you are pretty sure hes just a mass murderer even killing children (because adventurers kill all the things)
01-12-2017T16:09:52,SageSaga,oh and just to make it even more clear- you are also the greatest in the world at escaping :D
01-12-2017T16:10:08,w0lfmare,"""I wonder if I can kill children in this game... Yep"""
01-12-2017T16:10:17,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-victory: Bah. Nyna's got this. I believe
01-12-2017T16:10:30,ZoieFalcona,-.-  the mommawuff will have words about htat
01-12-2017T16:11:13,Bgrmystr2,You say that as if the adventurer didn't already get to the mother wolf first? :o
01-12-2017T16:11:23,Bgrmystr2,usually that's the first one you encounter.
01-12-2017T16:11:26,Bgrmystr2,:u
01-12-2017T16:13:55,SageSaga,Adventurers are the boogymen of Monsters
01-12-2017T16:14:47,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-laugh: Who are the real monsters tho xD
01-12-2017T16:15:42,SageSaga,"everyone that is evil - NPCs, Adventurers, and monsters that havent formed a functional community with rules and laws..."
01-12-2017T16:16:09,SageSaga,there were lots of bad adventurers
01-12-2017T16:17:18,ZoieFalcona,Momma's protecting kiddos can easily become monsters
01-12-2017T16:18:07,SageSaga,it's gonna be a while before we meet Nyna's Momma
01-12-2017T16:21:51,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: I'm not used to seeing monsters with family lol
01-12-2017T16:22:12,ZoieFalcona,Hmm... what would her momma be like :3
01-12-2017T16:23:48,Bgrmystr2,full-power nekomata possibly?
01-12-2017T16:24:11,Bgrmystr2,don't they gain power as they get older?
01-12-2017T16:25:48,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: might be thinking of 9 tailed foxes
01-12-2017T16:25:54,Bgrmystr2,I know they do
01-12-2017T16:27:11,SageSaga,Nekomata don't really get stronger with age as Kitsune do- but with age comes wisdom and Nekomata are very long lived
01-12-2017T16:27:38,Bgrmystr2,"ahh ok. Aren't Nekomata considered stronger than normal cats though, usually?"
01-12-2017T16:27:57,Bgrmystr2,or is that like.. a game / anime kind of adaptation thing?
01-12-2017T16:30:04,SageSaga,. . .
01-12-2017T16:30:43,SageSaga,yes - Nekomata are CONSIDERABLY stronger than NORMAL cats.
01-12-2017T16:31:09,Bgrmystr2,"well, are there not cat youkai in general that aren't nekomata? ._."
01-12-2017T16:32:35,Mihari,"I imagine things like normal feral cats would be fodder for crafting, and a laughable threat to a player, where as the nekomattas would be elite monsters."
01-12-2017T16:32:41,Bgrmystr2,I didn't mean like household cats or whatever
01-12-2017T16:32:49,SageSaga,the two Yokai cats im most familiar with are Nekomata and Bakeneko
01-12-2017T16:34:00,Twokinds,oi
01-12-2017T16:34:05,Bgrmystr2,maybe I'm thinking of Bakeneko
01-12-2017T16:34:07,Bgrmystr2,heya tom
01-12-2017T16:34:10,FoxxTrotter,"Hey, Tom."
01-12-2017T16:34:11,BadFoMo,Yo?
01-12-2017T16:34:14,SageSaga,someone posted on the comments when Kaylin grabbed Nyna's tail and said it was split- so she must be a Nekomata
01-12-2017T16:34:26,SageSaga,"and they said ""Could also be a Bakeneko"""
01-12-2017T16:34:30,SageSaga,and its like . . . NO
01-12-2017T16:34:35,SageSaga,yo Tom
01-12-2017T16:34:57,Azumachan,Hey Tom
01-12-2017T16:35:20,SageSaga,Nekomata are the split tail Yokai
01-12-2017T16:35:24,Bgrmystr2,lol sage yeah I saw that
01-12-2017T16:35:58,Bgrmystr2,"I was just wondering if Nekomata are stronger in general than non-split tail cat youkai, didn't recall they were bakeneko"
01-12-2017T16:35:58,Mihari,Hey Tom
01-12-2017T16:36:29,Bgrmystr2,I'm not super-brushed up on a lot of folklore
01-12-2017T16:37:45,Bgrmystr2,Touhou has introduced me to a lot of great folklore.. perhaps too much to remember reliably :ptv-uneasy:
01-12-2017T16:37:59,SageSaga,Bakeneko are basically cats that have turned into monsters- usually from being treated cruelly or after killing a human
01-12-2017T16:38:16,Twokinds,Hallo
01-12-2017T16:38:33,SageSaga,they retain a lot of their cat like features and are more of a feral state
01-12-2017T16:38:55,Bgrmystr2,hmm
01-12-2017T16:39:38,Dinoman515,Heyy

01-12-2017T16:41:24,Bgrmystr2,the songs are really nice
01-12-2017T16:41:28,SageSaga,it would
01-12-2017T16:41:47,SageSaga,is it available from google play?
01-12-2017T16:42:04,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-wondering: I don't actually know
01-12-2017T16:42:07,Bgrmystr2,I don't have google play
01-12-2017T16:42:24,SageSaga,everyone has google play
01-12-2017T16:42:31,Bgrmystr2,I don;t.
01-12-2017T16:42:35,Bgrmystr2,don't* even
01-12-2017T16:42:38,Bgrmystr2,and yeah it is
01-12-2017T16:42:40,Bgrmystr2,I found it
01-12-2017T16:43:03,BadFoMo,What's Google Play?
01-12-2017T16:43:15,Bgrmystr2,Some music store I presume
01-12-2017T16:43:48,Dinoman515,"I am new to Tom's Comics, I read all 1005 pages in two days. I couldn't put ma' phone down. I think I have either a problem, or I'm supportive? Google Play's like the app store but for android."
01-12-2017T16:43:49,SageSaga,i'll buy it when i get my money
01-12-2017T16:45:48,Dinoman515,üëç
01-12-2017T16:47:05,Bgrmystr2,"That just means you like the comic, Dino"
01-12-2017T16:49:39,Dinoman515,"But trust me, once I get a well paying job, (if I ever do) I would go for the Nora Fate card just to help Tom out even more. ‚ù§"
01-12-2017T16:49:58,Dinoman515,But its not availiable apparently.
01-12-2017T16:50:01,FoxxTrotter,"Google Play is an app store for Android phones, I believe."
01-12-2017T16:50:23,Dinoman515,"Yeah, exactly."
01-12-2017T16:50:31,SageSaga,how do you people not know what google play is?
01-12-2017T16:50:31,Bgrmystr2,"of course not, Dino, there's only four per month"
01-12-2017T16:50:37,Bgrmystr2,I don't use google stuff
01-12-2017T16:50:56,Bgrmystr2,o.O
01-12-2017T16:51:01,SageSaga,everyone uses google-  dont tell me you use bing
01-12-2017T16:51:09,Bgrmystr2,no? I use startpage.
01-12-2017T16:51:17,Bgrmystr2,or IXquick if startpage doesn't work
01-12-2017T16:51:26,BadFoMo,"//Troll Ok, I won't."
01-12-2017T16:51:33,Bgrmystr2,"I don't use bing, no lol"
01-12-2017T16:51:43,Bgrmystr2,"never touched it, honestly"
01-12-2017T16:51:51,SageSaga,startpage is google
01-12-2017T16:52:32,Dinoman515,Do people still use Yahoo?
01-12-2017T16:52:33,Bgrmystr2,"It's not google itself, it just gets the results from google without google logging your information to their servers lol"
01-12-2017T16:52:38,Bgrmystr2,"some people do, dino"
01-12-2017T16:52:44,Bgrmystr2,someone I live with does
01-12-2017T16:53:05,Dinoman515,"Oh, i thought it died or something like that."
01-12-2017T16:53:35,SageSaga,"people trying to protect themselves from companies like google and facebook, they just dont get it- if they are online- it's too late"
01-12-2017T16:53:43,Bgrmystr2,Yahoo is still there lol
01-12-2017T16:53:52,Dinoman515,XD
01-12-2017T16:54:05,Azumachan,"Sage what kind of Brush have you used for the magic effect, its really nice"
01-12-2017T16:54:25,SageSaga,i use a bunch of different brushes
01-12-2017T16:54:35,Bgrmystr2,Just because it's a possibility doesn't mean it's actually factual.
01-12-2017T16:56:14,Dinoman515,"Well if you use Magic on Bushes, can you clean the Ticks out of Sage Brush? My dog got a Tick last month because he ran through a small forest of them."
01-12-2017T16:57:40,SageSaga,i used a splatter brush for part of it- and then i used a flame brush ontop of that
01-12-2017T16:57:50,SageSaga,and a droplet brush for a little extra
01-12-2017T16:58:17,SageSaga,brb
01-12-2017T17:04:23,SageSaga,back to working on this comic
01-12-2017T17:04:41,Twokinds,Welcome back!!
01-12-2017T17:04:49,SageSaga,ty Tom
01-12-2017T17:04:56,SageSaga,wonder how long this will take-
01-12-2017T17:06:38,SageSaga,Tom- Did ya think of a super hero character yet? :P
01-12-2017T17:07:16,Twokinds,"Man, it's such bad timing"
01-12-2017T17:07:23,Twokinds,"First of the Month, aaah"
01-12-2017T17:07:56,SageSaga,it's the second...
01-12-2017T17:08:43,Twokinds,I mean at the beginning of the month I do all my color work stuff. All the Nora Cards and Color Vote.
01-12-2017T17:10:06,Twokinds,Always a busy time.
01-12-2017T17:11:13,w0lfmare,"Boy, time flies"
01-12-2017T17:11:40,FoxxTrotter,"Hi, w0lf. :0)"
01-12-2017T17:11:41,Azumachan,Were sorry to give you extra work Tom.
01-12-2017T17:11:52,w0lfmare,Hello :cw0lfmare-HeadEmber:
01-12-2017T17:12:11,Bgrmystr2,heya w0lf
01-12-2017T17:12:51,Dinoman515,üòÄ
01-12-2017T17:12:58,Twokinds,I wish Wacom tablets just worked.
01-12-2017T17:13:10,Twokinds,This 27QHD has given me nothing but headaches.
01-12-2017T17:13:22,Azumachan,How so ?
01-12-2017T17:13:22,FoxxTrotter,Avencri just got one.
01-12-2017T17:13:33,Azumachan,I thought it was a new one ?
01-12-2017T17:14:01,Bgrmystr2,It was.
01-12-2017T17:14:21,Twokinds,"The tablet randomly stops working when you turn it on. The drivers crash Photoshop randomly every few days. The pen jitters randomly, and requires me to change windows to stop it."
01-12-2017T17:14:52,Twokinds,It's a lot more frustrating than my old tablet. I wish I had my 24 back.
01-12-2017T17:15:35,Dinoman515,Thats gotta suck when you livestream drawing. üò£
01-12-2017T17:15:36,w0lfmare,"My 12 has been super reliable, but it's getting old..."
01-12-2017T17:16:06,Dinoman515,But knowing me i only sketch with a pencil since i dont have money.
01-12-2017T17:16:14,SageSaga,i occasionally have touch on my tablet stop functioning but thats still pretty rare
01-12-2017T17:16:15,w0lfmare,It's starting to get spots and jitter along the edges of the screen
01-12-2017T17:16:54,MidnightBlue78,hello~ :ctwokinds-daydreamingkat:
01-12-2017T17:16:58,Twokinds,The Wacom expresskeys (wireless remote because the 27QHD doesn't have built-in controls) is AWFUL.
01-12-2017T17:17:22,Dinoman515,Hi! üòÅ
01-12-2017T17:17:25,w0lfmare,"I'd get a new one, but I'm saving what I have for books"
01-12-2017T17:17:28,Twokinds,"It's laggy and more inaccurate than built-in controls, and I feel like I'm turning it back on more often than using it."
01-12-2017T17:17:47,MidnightBlue78,"Sage,that looks really good"
01-12-2017T17:18:53,SageSaga,thanks
01-12-2017T17:19:02,Bgrmystr2,Yeah this is looking nice :thumbsup:

01-12-2017T18:38:42,MidnightBlue78,"oops, almost forgot about the color vote. Dont wanna forget that :ctwokinds-totallykat:"
01-12-2017T18:45:15,Azumachan,Anything today Tom ?
01-12-2017T19:17:53,BluePhantom90,I think he is just lurking
01-12-2017T20:45:30,BluePhantom90,soo anyone still alive here?

01-12-2017T21:00:13,BluePhantom90,do hope Fluffy Flora and Trace win. ^-^ would be a good laugh
01-12-2017T21:12:26,BluePhantom90,might not happen but would like to see it
01-12-2017T22:04:04,Dadrobit,"Not gonna lie, I really hope it doesn't. So many other ones that are so much more, I'd hate to see a slot used like that."
01-12-2017T22:05:33,BluePhantom90,hmmm yeah I mean I voted for others.
01-12-2017T22:42:55,MidnightBlue78,I am voting for Colin Boop just because I really want to see what color Tom will choose for Colin
01-12-2017T23:11:41,Bgrmystr2,We've already seen that in color midnight ._.
01-12-2017T23:17:16,Bgrmystr2,Tom's got what.. 4 or 5 of the comic pages WIP?
01-12-2017T23:20:39,Bgrmystr2,"to be fair, the poke one is nice though"
01-12-2017T23:24:44,MidnightBlue78,i've never seen them
01-12-2017T23:25:29,MidnightBlue78,:ctwokinds-sadtrace2:
01-12-2017T23:25:55,Bgrmystr2,they've been put into the chat lots of times
01-12-2017T23:26:09,Bgrmystr2,"unfortunately, I don't recall the direct links off the top of my head"
01-12-2017T23:26:43,Bgrmystr2,"the only one I do remember has 'spoiler' in the title, and that was the next book cover"
01-12-2017T23:27:11,Bgrmystr2,"I don't have those links either, though. :c"
01-12-2017T23:27:53,MidnightBlue78,during streams?
01-12-2017T23:28:20,MidnightBlue78,Bc I truly have never seen them before
01-12-2017T23:31:06,Bgrmystr2,hang around more then :v
01-12-2017T23:31:17,Bgrmystr2,usually it's right after the stream though
01-12-2017T23:31:36,MidnightBlue78,I thought i already did xD
01-12-2017T23:31:42,MidnightBlue78,I guess not
01-12-2017T23:31:43,Bgrmystr2,obviously not enough
01-12-2017T23:31:45,Dadrobit,"AFAIK we've only seen two and a half pages, but they're all in greyscale"
01-12-2017T23:32:01,Bgrmystr2,no? There's color on several of them
01-12-2017T23:32:25,Bgrmystr2,"I recall at least three pages, if not four"
01-12-2017T23:32:37,Bgrmystr2,and I'm fairly certain at least four.
01-12-2017T23:32:37,Dadrobit,https://i.imgur.com/qJew6WN.jpg is the most complete color i have
01-12-2017T23:33:20,Bgrmystr2,"ahhh, yeah that's the color I remember"
01-12-2017T23:33:43,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: It's a lot more purple than I remember though..
01-12-2017T23:33:49,MidnightBlue78,Is it right after the wed/friday streams by any chance? Bc i sometimes can stay awake for those. Bc if it had been after a sunday stream i would've definitely seen it
01-12-2017T23:34:19,Dadrobit,https://imgur.com/a/jHGY4 here's everything official that I have on the comic.
01-12-2017T23:34:21,MidnightBlue78,*cant

01-12-2017T23:35:45,Bgrmystr2,"Hell if I know, midnight. There's usually people chatting after every stream"
01-12-2017T23:36:29,Dadrobit,Sometimes it's at two in the morning on a Tuesday. Lurk harder :)
01-12-2017T23:36:29,MidnightBlue78,"yeah, i know üòõ"
