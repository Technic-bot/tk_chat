31-10-2017T15:43:23,drykeon,hello?
31-10-2017T15:44:47,TorqueEmUp,apparently there is too much lag in the joycons to do that challenge without the joycons connected directly to the system.
31-10-2017T15:45:09,drykeon,omg
31-10-2017T15:45:23,BluePhantom90,huh
31-10-2017T15:45:24,drykeon,i just watched my friend do that
31-10-2017T15:46:44,TorqueEmUp,"yeah, read something something about it, undocked it, and played it in handheld mode, and timed my jumps to the dust and got it first try, after almost an hour of trying it with wireless joycons while docked."
31-10-2017T15:47:56,drykeon,and then the records are in the thousands
31-10-2017T15:48:07,drykeon,and your just like

31-10-2017T15:50:33,TorqueEmUp,"Yeah, some people just have too much time on their hands, to basically do something that no one will ever really care about. lol"
31-10-2017T15:51:50,TorqueEmUp,or those records are cheats that just managed to cheat it using something that can perfectly time button presses.
31-10-2017T15:58:24,TorqueEmUp,"Heh just realized the Taxi license plates say 1981, the year Donkey Kong hit the arcades."

31-10-2017T22:04:29,TorqueEmUp,"this phone has like no dev scene, and all the typical rooting tools don't work for it."
31-10-2017T22:08:17,Bgrmystr2,"@BadFomo the moon is called the moon cuz that's what it is, a moon. Our moon has no name other than ""The moon"" simply because we're lazy xD.. other satellites on other planets are moons too"
31-10-2017T22:08:40,Bgrmystr2,"they have names, just like ours. it's just that ours isn't fancy"
31-10-2017T22:08:54,Bgrmystr2,"It's like calling a planet ""The Planet"""
31-10-2017T22:09:11,Bgrmystr2,past humans.. feh :ptv-unimpressed:

31-10-2017T22:55:55,MidnightBlue78,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
31-10-2017T22:58:41,TorqueEmUp,"Yeah I briefly looked into that one dadro, while the story may be good, I can't get passed the nekomimi style characters."
31-10-2017T23:08:45,Dadrobit,"Eh, it's whatever, there's some variety at least. Though the main character does suffer the rather fatal flaw of being a ""special snowflake"" breed"
31-10-2017T23:09:53,Dadrobit,"""Oh mah goodness! Everyone look at the main character just because she has an ears and tail that are slightly more special that the other characters!"""
31-10-2017T23:11:28,Dadrobit,"Only came up like two or three times in about 300+ pages, so it's not like, a main feature of the comic or anything. It's thankfuly mostly ignored."
31-10-2017T23:19:58,Dadrobit,"434 actually. It's in my ""comics"" BM folder, so it'll get checked on every once in a while at least. Hopefully it keeps up."
31-10-2017T23:21:42,Bgrmystr2,ugh 'passed' is gonna drive me up the wall dx
