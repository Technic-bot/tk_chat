04-11-2017T14:31:41,MidnightBlue78,"hmmmm, what seems to be causing you the most stress? is it the nora cards, or everything in general?"

04-11-2017T14:44:32,MidnightBlue78,is it scary?
04-11-2017T14:44:41,Twokinds,It's okay. A little cloudy.
04-11-2017T14:45:21,MidnightBlue78,cloudy... with a chance of meatballs?

04-11-2017T14:47:12,MidnightBlue78,xD
04-11-2017T14:48:47,MarshallMelon,"2 months after being AWOL and this place hasn't changed a bit. Same old crew as always. How's it happening, dudearinos?"
04-11-2017T14:49:02,MarshallMelon,Also i'm never using that word again jesus christ
04-11-2017T14:49:12,MidnightBlue78,hey Marshall!
04-11-2017T14:49:25,MidnightBlue78,"everything good, how about you?"
04-11-2017T14:49:29,NeonMitsumi,"Hahaha, welcome back Marshall! It's going well. Hopefully at you is too!"
04-11-2017T14:49:48,MarshallMelon,Had a near miss with a malfunctioning firework but aside from that all's good
04-11-2017T14:50:03,MarshallMelon,That's the 5th for you. It isn't a party until someone's on fire
04-11-2017T14:50:16,NeonMitsumi,takes note of that.
04-11-2017T14:50:17,MidnightBlue78,holy crap!
04-11-2017T14:52:26,MidnightBlue78,that is why i do not handle pyrotechnia
04-11-2017T14:53:42,MarshallMelon,Yeah. Luckily it was a smaller one. But there's nothing like that sinking feeling you get when a rocket uses up its thruster without budging an inch.
04-11-2017T14:54:12,NeonMitsumi,"Well, damn."
04-11-2017T14:54:33,MarshallMelon,So are we 30 mins or an hour and 30 mins out? I think US/UK times are temporarily out of sync
04-11-2017T14:55:35,Twokinds,one hour
04-11-2017T14:55:54,MarshallMelon,Gotcha
04-11-2017T14:56:45,Twokinds,It is currently 3:64 QM Eastern Time
04-11-2017T14:57:00,NeonMitsumi,Yes.
04-11-2017T14:59:38,MarshallMelon,We switched over from DST before you guys so I forgot your clocks synced up with ours this morning I believe?
04-11-2017T15:01:30,Twokinds,"We just flipped, apparently"
04-11-2017T15:01:40,Twokinds,I didn't really notice
04-11-2017T15:02:44,MidnightBlue78,"daylight saving's a bunch of bullshit, imo"
04-11-2017T15:02:59,Twokinds,Yeah

04-11-2017T15:15:52,iliar,@MarshallMelon Tom say you want Roses Backstory comic?
04-11-2017T15:16:01,MarshallMelon,He proposed a trade between us
04-11-2017T15:16:09,MarshallMelon,I believe he's handling it
04-11-2017T15:16:36,BadFoMo,"Wait, what?"
04-11-2017T15:16:50,NeonMitsumi,Huh
04-11-2017T15:17:03,MarshallMelon,I've got a high-res version of one of his sketches that i'm giving him
04-11-2017T15:17:07,ThingsAreMoving,"Are art commissions taxable, btw?"
04-11-2017T15:17:17,MarshallMelon,Only in souls
04-11-2017T15:17:20,ChromeDragon24,probably? idk
04-11-2017T15:17:29,NeonMitsumi,Damn. I have no souls to spare.
04-11-2017T15:17:30,MarshallMelon,But seeing as they're digital? I dunno
04-11-2017T15:17:47,MarshallMelon,"International as well, so stuff like VAT's all over the place"
04-11-2017T15:17:48,WereKeidran,"i commissioned a sketch from him at SDCC, there was no tax"
04-11-2017T15:18:13,ThingsAreMoving,I reckon tax offices could get billions of taxes every year out of it.
04-11-2017T15:18:19,MarshallMelon,I guess since it's not an official product and was made on the premises?
04-11-2017T15:18:38,MarshallMelon,It's like doodling something for someone in class and charging VAT for it
04-11-2017T15:18:53,Serpentfrog,I have plenty of souls. I harvest every time I correct someone.
04-11-2017T15:18:56,ThingsAreMoving,"One man's trash, etc. etc."
04-11-2017T15:18:58,NeonMitsumi,I'll just sit here and nod my head like I understand what's happening.
04-11-2017T15:19:09,djikoz,same here
04-11-2017T15:19:15,MarshallMelon,*Economics intensify*
04-11-2017T15:19:35,iliar,"@MarshallMelon As i say I do not need anything in return. But if you get the PSD file ""Private Muse"" I'll be glad."
04-11-2017T15:20:29,MarshallMelon,Got it
04-11-2017T15:20:33,ThingsAreMoving,"Alright, gonna afk for a bit more."
04-11-2017T15:20:39,ThingsAreMoving,cya in 35min
04-11-2017T15:20:47,MarshallMelon,Toodles
04-11-2017T15:20:56,NeonMitsumi,"Private Muse, ha?"
04-11-2017T15:21:03,Twokinds,"Well, I have to pay tax. xD"
04-11-2017T15:21:18,Twokinds,But I don't add tax. It's just in the price.
04-11-2017T15:21:34,WereKeidran,Tom! :ctwokinds-reniderp_flip:

04-11-2017T15:22:18,MarshallMelon,I never understood why Americans have to calculate it for everything they buy. The price you see should be the price you pay.
04-11-2017T15:22:30,NeonMitsumi,@MidnightBlue78 Perfect.
04-11-2017T15:22:30,MuonNeutrino,because we never do anything the most sensible way &gt;.&gt;
04-11-2017T15:22:36,ChromeDragon24,^
04-11-2017T15:22:37,MidnightBlue78,i agree damn it
04-11-2017T15:22:42,NeonMitsumi,Fahrenheit.  *cough*
04-11-2017T15:23:04,ChromeDragon24,honestly i had never heard of taxes being included in the price until not too long ago
04-11-2017T15:23:04,MuonNeutrino,the imperial measurements in general &gt;.&gt;
04-11-2017T15:23:13,ChromeDragon24,well for other countries i mean
04-11-2017T15:23:22,MarshallMelon,It's standard in the UK. Willing to bet in other places too.
04-11-2017T15:23:37,TheSocialLycanthrope,Standard in Sweden.
04-11-2017T15:23:42,TheSocialLycanthrope,Hello by the way.
04-11-2017T15:23:46,MarshallMelon,Hey
04-11-2017T15:23:47,Twokinds,That's why I generally calculate out my work at around $40 an hour.
04-11-2017T15:23:53,djikoz,hi
04-11-2017T15:23:59,Twokinds,About $10 of that ends up going to THE MAN. :ctwokinds-flomad:

04-11-2017T15:24:19,ChromeDragon24,omg
04-11-2017T15:24:20,AegisWolf,@MarshallMelon companies in the U.S. do it to make the price seem lower. You're less likely to balk at something that gets added at the last second.

04-11-2017T17:16:56,TheGamakazi,"The will be one for Humans, Keidran and Basitin"
04-11-2017T17:17:11,frmCast351,"i'm pretty sure it mentions subtly that chaos is relevant to the humans, neutral to the keidran, leaving order, reasonably, to the basitin"
04-11-2017T17:17:12,Bgrmystr2,I don't see why you think the masks are for the races
04-11-2017T17:17:16,Dadrobit,"They do not have a sense of morality, they follow their own desires as they will, for better or worse."
04-11-2017T17:17:19,ThingsAreMoving,What about Fishmen? @Gama
04-11-2017T17:17:22,TorqueEmUp,inb4 Tom is one of the masks.
04-11-2017T17:17:29,unsteddyphoenix,It's implied during their conversations
04-11-2017T17:17:32,Bgrmystr2,"Tom is above the masks, Torque"
04-11-2017T17:17:36,NeonMitsumi,The pizza guy runs the place

04-11-2017T17:17:48,ThingsAreMoving,"Tom is ""The Presence™"" of TwoKinds"
04-11-2017T17:17:48,unsteddyphoenix,He's actually...THE MANAGER
04-11-2017T17:17:50,TheGamakazi,@ThingsAreMoving ... We don't take about him :ptv-uneasy:
04-11-2017T17:17:52,ChromeDragon24,tom is more like the one above all
04-11-2017T17:17:52,Ordithus,He can erase them.  With his eraser.  It wouldn't even be hard.
04-11-2017T17:17:54,CrRAR,lol
04-11-2017T17:18:02,ThingsAreMoving,:ptv-confused:
04-11-2017T17:18:04,Bgrmystr2,"As far as I've read, the masks only align themselves with a race, but they're not specifically FOR that race."
04-11-2017T17:18:08,MidnightBlue78,does he know how to make pizza tho?
04-11-2017T17:18:11,Bgrmystr2,seems like a choice
04-11-2017T17:18:20,CrimsonHelsing,"TwoKinds vs Berserk, Godhands vs Masks! FIGHT!"
04-11-2017T17:18:20,ProsePro7,"Tom is what do they call it in Marvel universe ""The One Above All"""
04-11-2017T17:18:22,SomeOtherTom,The masks are above using super glue then I take it?

04-11-2017T17:18:40,djikoz,"Tom is above everything, thanks to his magic pen"
04-11-2017T17:18:43,Zakuru,is it bad that i kinda want this colored?
04-11-2017T17:18:48,unsteddyphoenix,YES

04-11-2017T17:18:51,MarshallMelon,The Living Tribunal would whoop their asses
04-11-2017T17:18:55,TheGamakazi,There will then most likely be a Mask on each races side
04-11-2017T17:18:55,AegisWolf,It's already colored. xD
04-11-2017T17:18:56,ThingsAreMoving,Wouldn't the Chaos mask allow cross species breeding just to create more... chaos?
04-11-2017T17:18:57,Zakuru,it'll be all black and white huh
04-11-2017T17:18:57,unsteddyphoenix,YOU SHOULD FEEL BAD ABOUT THIS
04-11-2017T17:19:01,ProsePro7,That would be a quick coloring
04-11-2017T17:19:06,TheGamakazi,so at least 3
04-11-2017T17:19:13,unsteddyphoenix,Ay I bet the background would have some sick effect though
04-11-2017T17:19:14,Zakuru,it would be a great wallpaper
04-11-2017T17:19:16,Flarenightshade,Reminds me a bit of the anbu black ops

04-11-2017T17:20:38,ThingsAreMoving,I mean... I've seen a comic with melons a few years back
04-11-2017T17:20:42,ProsePro7,Does anyone else thing of the Q when they see the Masks
04-11-2017T17:20:43,TheGamakazi,Why does a Mask need a cloak? :ptv-confused:
04-11-2017T17:20:47,AegisWolf,"Birds just want you think they need wings to fly, they're really just cooling fins for the hyperdrive."

04-11-2017T17:36:55,ValSalianResident,I can imagine Nora accidentally killing/horribly tranforming a lot of people until she mastered true transformation

04-11-2017T17:37:14,unsteddyphoenix,Can only be a few
04-11-2017T17:37:15,ThingsAreMoving,yup

04-11-2017T17:37:28,unsteddyphoenix,Tom can salvage almost any suggestion
04-11-2017T17:37:29,Ordithus,She turned me into a newt!
04-11-2017T17:37:35,Bgrmystr2,and then you'll see the result and instant regret
04-11-2017T17:37:36,Bgrmystr2,calling it
04-11-2017T17:37:39,WereKeidran,doesn't she use illusions for her transformation? i know Clovis was a permanent change but Mike's was an illusion
04-11-2017T17:37:40,ValSalianResident,"""My zeal for blood rituals and summoning rites had begun to ebb, as each attempt invariably brought only failure and disappointment. Progress was halting, and the rapidly accumulating surplus of wasted flesh had become burdensome."""

04-11-2017T17:37:48,Foxpie,you could joke and say nora messed up and made dog keidran form trying to change a wolf to somthing
04-11-2017T17:37:54,Dadrobit,This just boils down to awkward genderbend suggestion #452
04-11-2017T17:37:57,unsteddyphoenix,Well with Nora it can be either
04-11-2017T17:38:10,unsteddyphoenix,"Nora is broken, shes basically the same level as a mask"
04-11-2017T17:38:16,unsteddyphoenix,Way beyond a normal dragon
04-11-2017T17:38:17,Bgrmystr2,it doesn't have to be genderbend
04-11-2017T17:38:20,Glassan,Maybe this is how Basitins came to be. Mixing cats and rabbits.
04-11-2017T17:38:21,MarshallMelon,Except when she's almost dead
04-11-2017T17:38:22,Dimensional,Nora uses either depending on who is the subject and if they are deserving of it
04-11-2017T17:38:23,Bgrmystr2,it only says transformation
04-11-2017T17:38:26,MarshallMelon,"Like now, for instance"
04-11-2017T17:38:30,ThingsAreMoving,"Nora OP, better nerf Irelia!"

04-11-2017T17:39:30,ThingsAreMoving,Nora could be an avatar of chaos mask

04-11-2017T18:48:10,Dadrobit,Please oh please don't let there be a Raine suggestion when mine comes up. I want at least something of a chance...

04-11-2017T18:49:21,PalmettoPathfinder1,And Nat and Keith aren't doing too well!  The dwarf has already drank 95 mugs of ale and he's still freaking somber!  he demands 150 more ales much to Nat and Keith's regret

04-11-2017T18:59:37,Bgrmystr2,I don't think you understand that concept.
04-11-2017T18:59:40,PalmettoPathfinder1,Why?  is that bad?
04-11-2017T18:59:41,ThingsAreMoving,what was that?
04-11-2017T18:59:45,LeKnightWolf,So would this spell work on humans like Red?
04-11-2017T18:59:50,crimsonreaper,that is one long tail dang :P
04-11-2017T18:59:53,MarshallMelon,"There would be no survivors, Pal"
04-11-2017T18:59:58,Bgrmystr2,Basitins don't get drunk really easily.
04-11-2017T19:00:01,Bgrmystr2,"like, at all."
04-11-2017T19:00:02,Dimensional,"Hmm, I wonder if Nibbly and Raine can speak to each other now."
04-11-2017T19:00:07,Dimensional,Both are feral animals now.
04-11-2017T19:00:16,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Raine's not feral
04-11-2017T19:00:19,MviluUatusun,"Well, Bgr, they are immune to most poisons."
04-11-2017T19:00:20,PalmettoPathfinder1,I remember that pic of where Keith and Nat are getting drunk together.
04-11-2017T19:00:29,Bgrmystr2,"that's my point, Mvilu"
04-11-2017T19:00:32,MarshallMelon,"Sober Keith, Drunk Nat"
04-11-2017T19:00:33,Kynum,"""Name your poison"""
04-11-2017T19:00:33,MviluUatusun,LOL.
04-11-2017T19:00:35,MarshallMelon,I remember that one
04-11-2017T19:01:01,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Well, Keith was slightly drunk....I think."
04-11-2017T19:01:03,Xexanoth,"Basitin can get Drunk, just not as easy"
04-11-2017T19:01:14,Beardedskynet,High metabolism
04-11-2017T19:01:16,Bgrmystr2,not nearly as drunk as others
04-11-2017T19:01:18,Bgrmystr2,likely only a buzz
04-11-2017T19:01:20,Bgrmystr2,and that's it
04-11-2017T19:01:25,Bgrmystr2,it's already been explained a few times
04-11-2017T19:01:27,Ordithus,Never trust Karen with magic and magical artifacts
04-11-2017T19:01:31,MuonNeutrino,"adelaide being a basitin with the inherent resistance, and then her sheer size, she could probably chug an entire keg and not feel a thing"
04-11-2017T19:01:40,Bgrmystr2,"basically, Muon"
04-11-2017T19:01:42,ThingsAreMoving,You inject 100ml pure alcohol directly into their bloodstream to get them tipsy.
04-11-2017T19:01:50,ThingsAreMoving,that's how badass they are
04-11-2017T19:01:51,Beardedskynet,Adelaide would need 3 barrels
04-11-2017T19:01:59,MarvTheHugPharaoh,thats one smol wolfy
04-11-2017T19:02:01,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Hm.....Okay then, let's switch it.  A drunk Nat hits on Adelaide, who is both interestedd and confused."
04-11-2017T19:02:04,Bgrmystr2,"you say that as if you could break their skin with a needle, Things?"
04-11-2017T19:02:09,Bgrmystr2,cuz I dunno if you're gonna get that far
04-11-2017T19:02:27,ThingsAreMoving,You need a powerdrill ofc
04-11-2017T19:02:32,ThingsAreMoving,a magic powerdrill
04-11-2017T19:02:36,Ordithus,She must be stopped https://www.patreon.com/posts/kitty-maren-11311151
04-11-2017T19:02:38,Bgrmystr2,haha
04-11-2017T19:02:39,Beardedskynet,Don't think they have exoskeletons. :D
04-11-2017T19:02:43,PalmettoPathfinder1,oh gosh!  I've become a Natani x Adelaide shipper!
04-11-2017T19:02:50,FenceEqualizer,Errr...
04-11-2017T19:02:52,ThingsAreMoving,nothing wrong with that
04-11-2017T19:02:53,Strongpaw,I thought it was never trust Mike and Evals with magical artifacts and giving Flora booze :P
04-11-2017T19:03:05,PalmettoPathfinder1,@Strongpaw that's true.
04-11-2017T19:03:09,Bgrmystr2,"it's not an exoskeleton, it's sheer skin toughness, skynet"
04-11-2017T19:03:10,MidnightBlue78,"nothing wrong with it, just not gonna happen"
04-11-2017T19:03:12,Zebranky,Also never give Flora enchanted mistletoe
04-11-2017T19:03:15,Ordithus,That too
04-11-2017T19:03:42,MviluUatusun,"It worked once, Zebranky."
04-11-2017T19:03:50,unsteddyphoenix,Flora has the power to screw up any and all pranks she attempts.
04-11-2017T19:03:51,KiTA,"Kat, with Enchanted Mistletoe on her tail, running streaming from a stream of everyone except Eric"
04-11-2017T19:03:53,ThingsAreMoving,once in five years?
04-11-2017T19:03:57,ThingsAreMoving,or six?
04-11-2017T19:03:58,Zebranky,It has a pretty bad track record.
04-11-2017T19:04:16,MviluUatusun,"Well, that's true, Zeb."
04-11-2017T19:04:22,Bgrmystr2,the magic mistletoe?
04-11-2017T19:04:24,Bgrmystr2,no it hasn't
04-11-2017T19:04:25,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Ah okay.  Well, I think this one might be good: Keith in bed with Nat....and Laura, and Adelaide, and he's wondering what the heck has happened!"
04-11-2017T19:04:29,Bgrmystr2,it's got a good track record
04-11-2017T19:04:30,Bgrmystr2,it WORKS
04-11-2017T19:04:33,MviluUatusun,"But, only because the wrong people got ahold of it."
04-11-2017T19:04:33,Bgrmystr2,and that's what matters.
04-11-2017T19:04:36,PalmettoPathfinder1,It's the morning after people.
04-11-2017T19:04:41,Zebranky,Well... yes.
04-11-2017T19:04:53,unsteddyphoenix,what else you got
04-11-2017T19:04:55,Bgrmystr2,just because people use it wrong doesn't mean the track record is bad
04-11-2017T19:05:00,Bgrmystr2,it just means the people are the bad.
04-11-2017T19:05:04,Bgrmystr2,xD
04-11-2017T19:05:09,Beardedskynet,"I think if Keith found himself in bed with the King by accident, he'd be running away out the closest window."
04-11-2017T19:05:24,Bgrmystr2,how would that even happen
04-11-2017T19:05:27,ChromeDragon24,smart
04-11-2017T19:05:36,Xexanoth,i think Laura would be more creepy considering she's dead

04-11-2017T19:13:23,Beardedskynet,Tom
04-11-2017T19:13:27,FenceEqualizer,Didn't think that was debatable.
04-11-2017T19:13:31,Dadrobit,"Depends on whether or not the ice cream counted,"
04-11-2017T19:13:31,ThingsAreMoving,Do we count the ice cream incident?
04-11-2017T19:13:34,MarshallMelon,"Next one is a Tom Pick, one after that is a vot"

04-11-2017T19:13:36,MarshallMelon,*vote
04-11-2017T19:13:36,Bgrmystr2,it's not debatable
04-11-2017T19:13:44,Bgrmystr2,ice cream isn't counted
04-11-2017T19:13:50,Sarandiel,wait ice cream happened?

04-11-2017T20:06:27,MarvTheHugPharaoh,@Sarandiel but then my suggestion's fall apart

04-11-2017T20:06:30,TheRedFoxArt,Owo
04-11-2017T20:06:42,Ordithus,Then there's her apperances in the art book
04-11-2017T20:06:50,ThingsAreMoving,"Ord, that is not sexy. That's sweet"
04-11-2017T20:06:58,Ordithus,And sexy

04-11-2017T20:07:08,Ordithus,He just drew her completely naked!

04-11-2017T20:07:38,Xexanoth,"@MuonNeutrino the Raine not being drawn in the Body chart was acutally Tom not wanting to do 4 characters, and raine had already been drawn 2 Time that stream if i remember correctly"

04-11-2017T20:07:56,ThingsAreMoving,lol muon
04-11-2017T20:07:59,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Well, I did request that she was trying to cover herself up."
04-11-2017T20:08:05,unsteddyphoenix,"And again, Raine would need two iterations in a chart, since she has two forms"

04-11-2017T20:08:13,ThingsAreMoving,now three
04-11-2017T20:08:13,Bgrmystr2,It was due to 4 characters.

04-11-2017T20:10:56,w0lfmare,Doesn't really make sense...
04-11-2017T20:11:02,ThingsAreMoving,Imagine how hyper is Maddie going to be once she digests all this sugar.
04-11-2017T20:11:14,PalmettoPathfinder1,"That's okay, Bgr.  Well, she is trying to do that, but she's fighting it as her aunt is telling her it's okay to walk around with no clothes on."

04-11-2017T20:37:47,PalmettoPathfinder1,"So, yeah Maddie will be like this at Christmas, just not with candy.  @FenceEqualizer, I'm doing that before Thanksgiving.  Well, dang Tom has us beat."
04-11-2017T20:37:47,CrimsonHelsing,Clever guy!
04-11-2017T20:37:48,Bgrmystr2,"lol everyone I know keeps the christmas tree up all year, or as long as they can"
04-11-2017T20:37:50,ProsePro7,Tom be honest you never took it down
04-11-2017T20:37:50,FenceEqualizer,Ooo. I like the way you think Tom. Super prepared.

04-11-2017T20:37:52,unsteddyphoenix,Thats...not how that works
04-11-2017T20:37:57,Bgrmystr2,they decorate it for every holiday
04-11-2017T20:37:58,MidnightBlue78,or you just never took it down
04-11-2017T20:37:59,CrRAR,That means you get priority present processing.
04-11-2017T20:38:03,azenzeph,yes
04-11-2017T20:38:05,Twokinds,No we took it down in June

04-11-2017T20:38:13,TheRedFoxArt,oooh
04-11-2017T20:38:13,Xexanoth,LIFEHACK: You never have to decorate for christmas if you never take the decorations down
04-11-2017T20:38:16,MidnightBlue78,seriously??
04-11-2017T20:38:19,ThingsAreMoving,"you're supposed to cut the tree in may, and plant a new one in august"
04-11-2017T20:38:20,Bgrmystr2,"Tom, you didn't have a 4th of July tree?"
04-11-2017T20:38:22,unsteddyphoenix,That is literally the worst way to do it
04-11-2017T20:38:24,Bgrmystr2,That makes me sad
04-11-2017T20:38:25,MidnightBlue78,but why so early tho?
04-11-2017T20:38:25,Ordithus,So Christmas lasts 10 months or something?
04-11-2017T20:38:26,Sarandiel,Why'd you take the tree down for a month?
04-11-2017T20:38:27,Sammit,wb Edinku

04-11-2017T20:38:33,PalmettoPathfinder1,"What's wrong with how Tom does it, unstedddy?"
04-11-2017T20:38:37,Combak,Tom obviously has a fake tree.
04-11-2017T20:38:43,Ordithus,Or a fire hazard
04-11-2017T20:38:44,PalmettoPathfinder1,Fake trees are safer.
04-11-2017T20:38:51,Bgrmystr2,they are also boring
04-11-2017T20:38:53,ThingsAreMoving,uglier
04-11-2017T20:38:55,MidnightBlue78,you should have just left it then
04-11-2017T20:39:02,Bgrmystr2,the good ones aren't uglier
04-11-2017T20:39:05,TheRedFoxArt,"Yeah, are better thn the real ones"

04-11-2017T20:39:08,Sarandiel,I plan on building a house around a live tree...never need to kill a tree or get a fake. Just expand the roof every few years
04-11-2017T20:39:09,Ordithus,what's this
04-11-2017T20:39:09,FenceEqualizer,Fake trees are cleaner.

04-11-2017T21:38:37,FenceEqualizer,Well it's not for everyone. Movies are too expensive nowa days.
04-11-2017T21:38:59,Twokinds,Not really.
04-11-2017T21:39:01,BluePhantom90,THOR
04-11-2017T21:39:02,FenceEqualizer,"Same Robit, People keep saying they're good"
04-11-2017T21:39:03,TorqueEmUp,Blade Runner 2049 was pretty friggin' sweet
04-11-2017T21:39:08,unsteddyphoenix,And netflix exists
04-11-2017T21:39:15,BluePhantom90,i still need to go see the Thor movie
04-11-2017T21:39:18,Ordithus,Just not into it?
04-11-2017T21:39:35,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Torque, I think the new Thor is better then blade runner"
04-11-2017T21:39:40,TorqueEmUp,Movies aren't expensive to go to at all. Stupid people who buy the overpriced concessions think that. lol
04-11-2017T21:39:53,unsteddyphoenix,Ive seen neither yet but im upset
04-11-2017T21:39:53,TorqueEmUp,Also probably depends on where you live.
04-11-2017T21:40:08,FenceEqualizer,San Diego says otherwise
04-11-2017T21:40:12,TorqueEmUp,Oh really? Marv?
04-11-2017T21:40:13,Ordithus,Oooh Blade Runner is in theaters.  I must go see that.
04-11-2017T21:40:22,FenceEqualizer,Dang tickets are to high.
04-11-2017T21:40:28,MarvTheHugPharaoh,tickets here are like 12 per person
04-11-2017T21:40:28,unsteddyphoenix,Though the new thor has that kiwi guy right?
04-11-2017T21:40:36,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
04-11-2017T21:40:49,TorqueEmUp,"It's definitely worth seeing, I honestly like it more than the original."
04-11-2017T21:40:53,Dadrobit,"12.50 a ticket, and 2$ for a Big Gulp and large popcorn with a free refill here."
04-11-2017T21:40:57,TorqueEmUp,Blade runner I mean
04-11-2017T21:40:59,unsteddyphoenix,His accent was beautiful
04-11-2017T21:41:09,MarvTheHugPharaoh,it fits him
04-11-2017T21:41:10,FenceEqualizer,I hate you Robit. :ptv-whiny:
04-11-2017T21:41:12,Ordithus,"The original was really good, so that is some hig praise"
04-11-2017T21:41:17,Ordithus,high
04-11-2017T21:41:18,TorqueEmUp,"Get MoviePass, $10 a month, you can see 1 movie a day, every day of the month."
04-11-2017T21:41:22,FenceEqualizer,I say that with love.
04-11-2017T21:41:33,Dadrobit,"Sorry, come out here to AZ, good times will be had."
04-11-2017T21:41:41,Dadrobit,Not even hot anymore :D
04-11-2017T21:41:54,unsteddyphoenix,The original was completely carried by the amazing atmosphere imo
04-11-2017T21:41:56,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"the theater here its 12 for a ticket, the like 4 or 5 for a feel meal thats delivered to you when its done"
04-11-2017T21:42:04,Dadrobit,except in your car in the middle of the day if you can't find shade...
04-11-2017T21:42:16,TorqueEmUp,"agreed unsteddy, Harrison Ford's acting was like a plank of wood."
04-11-2017T21:42:16,MarvTheHugPharaoh,the hell is going on with my typing
04-11-2017T21:42:35,Dadrobit,feel meal.
04-11-2017T21:42:43,Ordithus,"I will touch my food, thank you"
04-11-2017T21:42:50,FenceEqualizer,Lewd?
04-11-2017T21:43:03,TorqueEmUp,I sneak my own food and drink into the theater. lol
04-11-2017T21:43:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,ment to type full meal
04-11-2017T21:43:25,Dadrobit,We have a chain called AMC that does the same. Big comfy lazy boy electric chairs with subwoofers under each one.
04-11-2017T21:43:36,Dadrobit,Except they are a bit expensive.
04-11-2017T21:43:42,FenceEqualizer,That sounds amazing
04-11-2017T21:43:43,TorqueEmUp,Yeah we have Cinemark theaters here that have those
04-11-2017T21:43:45,MarvTheHugPharaoh,like chicken Teriyaki with a side of rice
04-11-2017T21:44:00,FenceEqualizer,Like one could fall asleep in those chairs.
04-11-2017T21:44:01,Ordithus,Marcus is copying AMC now
04-11-2017T21:44:27,Ordithus,They finally have decent chairs
04-11-2017T21:45:37,Dadrobit,"Huh, actually not as bad as I remembered. $10.29 for one adult to reserve a seat in the Blade Runner showing"
04-11-2017T21:45:58,MarvTheHugPharaoh,is that on fandago?
04-11-2017T21:46:11,FenceEqualizer,And does that cover weekends?
04-11-2017T21:46:21,TorqueEmUp,they always charge a convenience fee
04-11-2017T21:46:47,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"here its around 12 if you buy at the theater, 24 if you use fandago"
04-11-2017T21:46:52,FenceEqualizer,"Oh wait, They charge 10.29 to reserve a seat? Not including tickets?"
04-11-2017T21:46:53,TorqueEmUp,"Look into MoviePass though, I've got that, and it works great."
04-11-2017T21:47:11,Dadrobit,"Ah, indeed. $2.00 convenience fee."
04-11-2017T21:47:31,TorqueEmUp,"$10 a month, if you use it once a month you are already out on top. lol"
04-11-2017T21:47:32,MidnightBlue78,that's why i would rather wait until theyre out on redbox
04-11-2017T21:47:36,Dadrobit,14.29 for Thor Ragnarok
04-11-2017T21:47:37,FenceEqualizer,Oh forget that. I'll stick to my cheapskate lawn chair seat
04-11-2017T21:47:46,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"go see Thor, its super Funny"
04-11-2017T21:47:51,LeKnightWolf,:neutral_face::zipper_mouth:
04-11-2017T21:48:01,Dadrobit,"No, reservation includes ticket price lol"
04-11-2017T21:48:15,MidnightBlue78,i dont spend that much money on a movie i might fall asleep watching
04-11-2017T21:48:19,FenceEqualizer,"Oh, nevermind then."
04-11-2017T21:48:33,Dadrobit,"I would Torque, except I probably wouldn't even do that lol."
04-11-2017T21:48:44,TorqueEmUp,any theater that has recliner chairs usually has reserved seating.
04-11-2017T21:48:49,Dadrobit,I see movies like 4-7 times a year
04-11-2017T21:48:56,FenceEqualizer,^
04-11-2017T21:49:15,Dadrobit,And half of those are the $5 showings
04-11-2017T21:49:25,TorqueEmUp,I probably go more than most people. lol
04-11-2017T21:49:48,TorqueEmUp,"anything remotely interesting comes up, me and a friend go and see it, even if it's something that most likely will be crap. lol"
04-11-2017T21:49:53,TorqueEmUp,Like The Mummy
04-11-2017T21:49:59,Dadrobit,"Maybe if I had the service, I'd make use of it, but since I don't feel like spending more money right now...."
04-11-2017T21:50:03,TorqueEmUp,or Dark Tower
04-11-2017T21:50:31,FenceEqualizer,The mummy was terrible.
04-11-2017T21:50:39,MarvTheHugPharaoh,the mummy game is awesome
04-11-2017T21:50:45,Dadrobit,I think the last movie I saw was Cars 3 with the grandparents and some of my nieces and nephews.
04-11-2017T21:51:01,unsteddyphoenix,A classic
04-11-2017T21:51:04,Dadrobit,"And that was like, in July"
04-11-2017T21:51:09,TorqueEmUp,"The Mummy was alright, it was watchable"
04-11-2017T21:51:26,FenceEqualizer,Well I got to see Tom cruise get his butt kicked. So that was fun.
04-11-2017T21:51:35,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"It had no brendan fraser, so the fun was sucked out of it"
04-11-2017T21:51:43,Dadrobit,^
04-11-2017T21:51:50,MidnightBlue78,Tom cruise :ctwokinds-eyeroll:
04-11-2017T21:51:56,FenceEqualizer,^
04-11-2017T21:51:56,TorqueEmUp,"Never saw the original, so I didn't have that prejudice against it"
04-11-2017T21:52:15,Dadrobit,Actually went back and watched the old movies not too long ago. They are waaaay more slapstick than I remembered as a kid lol
04-11-2017T21:52:18,MidnightBlue78,You never saw the original Mummy movie????
04-11-2017T21:52:21,TorqueEmUp,and I enjoy Tom Cruise movies so *shrug*
04-11-2017T21:52:32,FenceEqualizer,Don't think you need prejudice for it. The movie just felt all over the place.
04-11-2017T21:52:33,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"the old ones are amazing, just so dumb and fun"
04-11-2017T21:52:46,FenceEqualizer,As you said it was watchable
04-11-2017T21:52:48,Ordithus,The originals were pretty self aware
04-11-2017T21:52:49,MidnightBlue78,major flop
04-11-2017T21:53:09,Dadrobit,"The first one was the best by far, but the others were still definitely great."
04-11-2017T21:53:21,TorqueEmUp,*shrug* like I said it was watchable
04-11-2017T21:53:27,TorqueEmUp,probably something I won't watch again though
04-11-2017T21:53:30,FenceEqualizer,90's mummy will always be my favorite.
04-11-2017T21:53:54,Dadrobit,Tom Cruise is alright when he's not over-acting his parts.
04-11-2017T21:54:10,MarvTheHugPharaoh,he was fun in edge of tomorrow
04-11-2017T21:54:12,Ordithus,"'99 wow, that was a long time ago"
04-11-2017T21:54:19,FenceEqualizer,Well if it helps he wasn't overacting in the mummy
04-11-2017T21:54:33,MidnightBlue78,"no, just acting badly"
04-11-2017T21:54:50,Dadrobit,"Yeah, actually liked Edge of Tomorrow for the most part."
04-11-2017T21:55:47,Dadrobit,"The plot had a few too many issues by the end, but the action was fun."
04-11-2017T21:56:20,FenceEqualizer,"Huh, just looked that up. I never saw that movie but the premise sounds interesting"
04-11-2017T21:56:48,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Its good for the most part
04-11-2017T21:57:31,TorqueEmUp,Is that the one where he dies over and over?
04-11-2017T21:57:35,MarvTheHugPharaoh,yes
04-11-2017T21:57:37,FenceEqualizer,Yeah
04-11-2017T21:57:48,MarvTheHugPharaoh,alot of those deaths are just funny
04-11-2017T21:57:54,FenceEqualizer,I'll have to see if it's on amazon prime later
04-11-2017T21:58:21,TorqueEmUp,That one was pretty good. I think there was another sci-fi Tom Cruise movie that came out around that same time too
04-11-2017T21:58:32,TorqueEmUp,trying to remember what it was
04-11-2017T21:59:20,TorqueEmUp,ahh it came out the year before
04-11-2017T21:59:22,TorqueEmUp,Oblivion
04-11-2017T21:59:27,Dadrobit,The one with Morgan Freeman right?
04-11-2017T21:59:31,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Oblivion was neat
04-11-2017T21:59:45,MarvTheHugPharaoh,visually it looked amazing
04-11-2017T21:59:48,Dadrobit,We actually used a clip from that in my Sound Design II class.
04-11-2017T22:00:28,MarvTheHugPharaoh,thats cool
04-11-2017T22:00:42,TorqueEmUp,"Yeah, looks like it was pretty subpar in terms of reviews. but I rather enjoyed it."
04-11-2017T22:01:06,FenceEqualizer,Whoa whoa whoa....Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman did a action movie together?
04-11-2017T22:01:08,Dadrobit,Had to re-create the audio of a part where Tom Cruise is flying past his base talking to his engineer getting landing permission or something like that
04-11-2017T22:01:15,FenceEqualizer,And I missed this!?
04-11-2017T22:01:34,TorqueEmUp,http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1483013/
04-11-2017T22:02:29,TorqueEmUp,Looks like it bombed hard
04-11-2017T22:02:38,TorqueEmUp,didn't come close to making its money back
04-11-2017T22:03:04,FenceEqualizer,Damn it Amazon prime never has anything.
04-11-2017T22:03:05,Dadrobit,It was pretty alright.
04-11-2017T22:03:17,TorqueEmUp,^
04-11-2017T22:03:32,TorqueEmUp,Far better than The Mummy. lol
04-11-2017T22:03:56,Dadrobit,"it was very ""Style over Substance"""
04-11-2017T22:04:15,MarvTheHugPharaoh,^
04-11-2017T22:05:08,FenceEqualizer,:arrow_up:
04-11-2017T22:05:38,TorqueEmUp,"NVM it did make some money back, I was looking at the US gross. Worldwide gross was more than double the budget, so yeah."
04-11-2017T22:06:06,TorqueEmUp,usually marketing costs about as much as the movie itself. so they didn't lose money. lol
04-11-2017T22:06:42,FenceEqualizer,So it just stayed above from flopping
04-11-2017T22:06:51,TorqueEmUp,pretty much
04-11-2017T22:08:58,TorqueEmUp,Though unfortunately Blade Runner 2049 seems to be doing rather awful at the box office
04-11-2017T22:10:01,TorqueEmUp,Seems like we can't have nice things.
04-11-2017T22:10:12,FenceEqualizer,Really? Thought it was going to do well from how everyone here was talking about it
04-11-2017T22:10:15,Dadrobit,I wonder how many folks went back to watch the first one for the first time for context and just decided to skip it if they watched a bad version?
04-11-2017T22:10:54,FenceEqualizer,Maybe it's just timing?
04-11-2017T22:11:00,TorqueEmUp,"Dunno, the most common dvd copy out there is the Final Cut, which is the best version."
04-11-2017T22:11:30,Dadrobit,"Yeah, but then there's the digital option where the original version is still available."
04-11-2017T22:12:01,Dadrobit,Who knows how many poor souls thought the original was the option to go for...
04-11-2017T22:12:12,TorqueEmUp,"Yeah the Theatrical release was the worst, with that god awful voice over throughout the entire movie."
04-11-2017T22:13:16,TorqueEmUp,Honestly you didn't need to see the original to see the sequel at all.
04-11-2017T22:13:33,FenceEqualizer,Was going to ask that
04-11-2017T22:13:34,Dadrobit,"""What is nuanced interpretation? : The Movie"""
04-11-2017T22:13:49,FenceEqualizer,Maybe I should try to catch the midnight showing
04-11-2017T22:14:40,TorqueEmUp,"Probably not going to find one, movies been out for a while now, most theaters around here only have a few showings a day of it."
04-11-2017T22:15:41,TorqueEmUp,But I do recommend it.
04-11-2017T22:15:58,Dadrobit,"Latest I can find in my area is a 10:45pm showing, so close enough."
04-11-2017T22:16:09,FenceEqualizer,You're right. One over here has a 10:25 P.M showing though
04-11-2017T22:16:37,FenceEqualizer,Might be worth checking out. Rather go when there's not a crowd.
04-11-2017T22:16:52,TorqueEmUp,understandable
04-11-2017T22:16:56,Dadrobit,Not throwing around extra money right now though. Need to save up dosh to get the kiddos gifts soon.
04-11-2017T22:17:06,TorqueEmUp,heck you would probably be the only one there sometimes.
04-11-2017T22:17:27,FenceEqualizer,I'm for that. I'll feel less akward about sneaking snacks and drinks
04-11-2017T22:17:29,TorqueEmUp,"When me and a friend went to see The Foreigner with Jackie Chan, we were the only two people in the entire theater. lol"
04-11-2017T22:17:51,TorqueEmUp,well
04-11-2017T22:17:52,Dadrobit,Forgot about that movie
04-11-2017T22:18:01,Dadrobit,"looked ""meh"""
04-11-2017T22:18:10,FenceEqualizer,Just wait for Cyber monday. Unless it's a birthday gift
04-11-2017T22:18:20,Dadrobit,"Which is odd to say about a Jackie Chan movie, love that guy"
04-11-2017T22:18:29,FenceEqualizer,Jackie Chan and meh should never be used in the same phrase.
04-11-2017T22:18:50,TorqueEmUp,It was pretty decent
04-11-2017T22:19:24,TorqueEmUp,"definitely had that feel of ""Taken"" in it, with the whole revenge thing."
04-11-2017T22:19:33,Dadrobit,"Looked too serious for me, like a Taken Ripoff"
04-11-2017T22:19:53,Dadrobit,"brb, gonna get some liquids."
04-11-2017T22:20:02,FenceEqualizer,"Huh, Jackie Chan in a full on serious movie seems off."
04-11-2017T22:20:23,TorqueEmUp,"yeah pretty much, except it was a Jackie Chan, as a father now that has nothing left to lose."
04-11-2017T22:21:08,FenceEqualizer,That is weird. I know he's done some serious movies but...damn it it's Jackie Chan! Most of his fight scenes always had a little bit of slap stick
04-11-2017T22:22:48,FenceEqualizer,That movie pass is starting to sound more and more tempting.
04-11-2017T22:23:04,FenceEqualizer,Missed to many movies in the years.
04-11-2017T22:23:17,Twokinds,:octopus:
04-11-2017T22:23:23,TorqueEmUp,"Again, decent movie. Saw it for free though because when we originally went to see it, the projectors fucked up since the theater had just opened a few days before, and the projectionist had already went home and no one there knew how to fix thm."
04-11-2017T22:23:27,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:snake:
04-11-2017T22:23:32,TorqueEmUp,So we got 2 free movie tickets and a refunds.

04-11-2017T22:26:56,LeKnightWolf,....
04-11-2017T22:27:36,TorqueEmUp,"But yeah take a look into MoviePass fence. It supports most theaters, but make sure your theaters are on the list of supported theaters."
04-11-2017T22:28:07,TorqueEmUp,"Only theater chain i've seen that doesn't support it around here was Cineopolis, but they are a small chain."
04-11-2017T22:28:32,BluePhantom90,Heard Kat box has few more cons they will bring some artist too so just wondering
04-11-2017T22:29:23,FenceEqualizer,I shall. Figure it'll be cheaper then buying tickets
04-11-2017T22:29:37,FenceEqualizer,And can watch two movies a month to get my money worth.
04-11-2017T22:29:50,TorqueEmUp,"of course, even if you only see 1 movie a month."

04-11-2017T23:16:27,Dadrobit,Was Nat in a basket spinning ever an official emote? Or was that relegated only to the forums?
04-11-2017T23:16:58,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I think forums
04-11-2017T23:18:06,Dadrobit,"S'what I thought, just makin' sure."
04-11-2017T23:34:33,Twokinds,I haven't seen that one
04-11-2017T23:36:12,BluePhantom90,"someone has to do a sketch idea of the Keidran characters at age 1, in a basket."
04-11-2017T23:36:25,Twokinds,I'm not good at drawing babies
04-11-2017T23:36:47,BluePhantom90,awww. then 3?
04-11-2017T23:38:32,Twokinds,no D:&lt;
04-11-2017T23:38:37,BluePhantom90,awww
04-11-2017T23:38:55,BluePhantom90,you did so good on baby flora
04-11-2017T23:39:18,BluePhantom90,could have them all wrapped up in a blanket.
04-11-2017T23:40:43,Kynum,like pigs?! :ptv-excited:
04-11-2017T23:41:26,BluePhantom90,"I mean baby Raine was cute, and Baby Maeve. YOU GOT THIS TOM!"
04-11-2017T23:43:36,Dadrobit,"If the forums search function actually works this century, I'll see if I can't find it."
04-11-2017T23:44:07,Aquaninja101,"If not, it's no big deal"
04-11-2017T23:44:18,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I feel like I want to make a Jurassic park theme's suggestion :thinking:
04-11-2017T23:44:30,MarvTheHugPharaoh,theme'd
04-11-2017T23:44:54,Aquaninja101,too me that wouldn't fit Marv
04-11-2017T23:46:30,FenceEqualizer,We had a fall out suggestion. Don't think there would be anything wrong with a jurassic park suggestion.
04-11-2017T23:47:03,MarvTheHugPharaoh,maybe some of the TK crew go one a jeep tour of the park?
04-11-2017T23:48:05,Dadrobit,"Does the TK forum search function crap out on any of you guys as well from time to time, or is it just me?"
04-11-2017T23:48:08,Aquaninja101,And Nora is the dinosaur stalking the jeep giving Trace looks?
04-11-2017T23:48:48,FenceEqualizer,Unfortuantly I haven't used the forums. So can't really say.
04-11-2017T23:49:15,Twokinds,It's not surprising
04-11-2017T23:49:18,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Nah aqua, just jeep tour, maybe some of them freak out over seeing a T-rex ro something"
04-11-2017T23:49:18,Twokinds,I mean it's phpbb
04-11-2017T23:49:27,Aquaninja101,"Sorry Dad, don't use the search much"
04-11-2017T23:49:32,Twokinds,It's 90% ducttape
04-11-2017T23:49:38,Aquaninja101,lel

04-11-2017T23:51:30,BluePhantom90,"How about this To""?"
04-11-2017T23:51:37,Dadrobit,"D: Ok, tried FF, Chrome, and Chrome on mobile off Wi Fi, definitely probably not me."
04-11-2017T23:51:39,BluePhantom90,damn
04-11-2017T23:51:41,Bgrmystr2,"At first, I read that as tom giving you a raspberry instead of actually labeling the forum"
04-11-2017T23:51:53,Bgrmystr2,but I guess he'd spell that differently. xDD
04-11-2017T23:52:21,Dadrobit,Tom and I are not so close that he would give me a raspberry me thinks lol.
04-11-2017T23:52:22,Bgrmystr2,"considering the nora sketch today, definitely learned. :thinking:"
04-11-2017T23:52:30,BluePhantom90,"How about this Tom. "" Baby Keidran Main charcaters wrapped in blankets in a basket""?"
04-11-2017T23:52:35,Bgrmystr2,"haha, you never know Dadro"
04-11-2017T23:52:39,Dadrobit,lol

04-11-2017T23:54:01,MarvTheHugPharaoh,my typing sucks hard today
04-11-2017T23:55:11,Dadrobit,"ugh, listening to a music stream, and they started playing a song with some muted pseudo-intellectual BS on an underlying track. Very distracting."
04-11-2017T23:55:43,Aquaninja101,kek?
04-11-2017T23:55:56,Aquaninja101,I have no idea what that even is
04-11-2017T23:56:49,Dadrobit,"Just some lady spouting off about ""unlocking the brain"" or something like that, except her voice is super muted so you can only make out every few words."
04-11-2017T23:57:41,unsteddyphoenix,Sounds like you didnt have a high enough IQ to understand their stream :thinking:
04-11-2017T23:57:56,Dadrobit,I guess not...
