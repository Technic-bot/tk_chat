03-11-2017T01:13:38,Bgrmystr2,"Well, I guess sometimes"
03-11-2017T01:13:41,Bgrmystr2,but not often
03-11-2017T01:14:09,crimsonreaper,uh the chat goes by pretty fast most of time i call that caos lol
03-11-2017T01:14:10,ZRO4825,"Oh, my bad. Brb, getting more Chaos."
03-11-2017T01:14:15,crimsonreaper,XD
03-11-2017T01:14:45,MarvTheHugPharaoh,its not Chaos until someone goes full on tour guide Nixon
03-11-2017T01:15:05,Bgrmystr2,"reaper, have you ever even touched twitch? D"
03-11-2017T01:15:06,Bgrmystr2,xD
03-11-2017T01:15:12,Bgrmystr2,cuz this chat isn't even remotely fast
03-11-2017T01:15:16,Bgrmystr2,even with 200 people it's not
03-11-2017T01:15:22,crimsonreaper,"yes i have, bunch of 3 year olds in those chats"
03-11-2017T01:15:40,Bgrmystr2,then you should probably know the difference between a fast chat and picarto chat :P
03-11-2017T01:15:47,crimsonreaper,hehe
03-11-2017T01:16:00,Bgrmystr2,though I guess after sitting through Twitch Plays Pokemon..
03-11-2017T01:16:05,Bgrmystr2,I'm sort of like..
03-11-2017T01:16:10,crimsonreaper,i diddnt say this was madness i said it was caos differance :P twitch is madness
03-11-2017T01:16:21,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno, I just don't see anything the same anymore."
03-11-2017T01:16:22,unsteddyphoenix,:thinking:
03-11-2017T01:16:31,TheVileOne,chaos is probably the word you want???
03-11-2017T01:16:42,crimsonreaper,fair enough Bgrmystr2
03-11-2017T01:16:53,TheVileOne,That pesky silent h
03-11-2017T01:17:14,Bgrmystr2,I wouldn't call anything less than Twitch Plays Pokemon as chaos
03-11-2017T01:17:16,unsteddyphoenix,kaos
03-11-2017T01:17:24,Bgrmystr2,phoenix pls
03-11-2017T01:18:14,Twokinds,kayauce
03-11-2017T01:18:23,Bgrmystr2,XD

03-11-2017T01:18:27,crimsonreaper,"hey tom, thaught you went to bed?"
03-11-2017T01:18:34,Bgrmystr2,he didn't.
03-11-2017T01:18:38,unsteddyphoenix,Hes sleepposting
03-11-2017T01:18:45,crimsonreaper,lol
03-11-2017T01:18:48,MarvTheHugPharaoh,its his stand
03-11-2017T01:18:55,Twokinds,I don't go to bed the moment I stop streaming.
03-11-2017T01:19:29,unsteddyphoenix,You mean sometimes youre awake and not streaming?
03-11-2017T01:19:31,Bgrmystr2,common misconception. Tom waits exactly two minutes and seven point five seconds before going to sleep
03-11-2017T01:19:39,unsteddyphoenix,This is unacceptable
03-11-2017T01:19:42,Bgrmystr2,and then is IMMEDIATELY sleeping
03-11-2017T01:19:46,crimsonreaper,tks for the stream tom
03-11-2017T01:20:05,unsteddyphoenix,i get it

03-11-2017T01:20:33,crimsonreaper,"oh yea gz on 14 years and 1,000 pages for 2kinds"
03-11-2017T01:20:52,MarvTheHugPharaoh,yosh is about to hit 2000 pages soon
03-11-2017T01:21:01,unsteddyphoenix,"Damn, really?"
03-11-2017T01:21:09,unsteddyphoenix,What is Yosh even about at this point
03-11-2017T01:21:12,crimsonreaper,lol it just hit 1k how is it going to hit 2k already?
03-11-2017T01:21:15,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Sage, educate this fool"
03-11-2017T01:21:17,crimsonreaper,"oh wait nvrm,"
03-11-2017T01:21:26,unsteddyphoenix,Give me a synopses in 20 words or fewer
03-11-2017T01:21:33,crimsonreaper,used to people using yosh as a turn of frase XD
03-11-2017T01:22:16,crimsonreaper,phrase* bah i cant spell
03-11-2017T01:23:13,ZRO4825,"Catgirls, magic, and dude with a heavy stick fight paranormal happenings."
03-11-2017T01:23:27,crimsonreaper,"AKA, snorefest :D"
03-11-2017T01:23:32,unsteddyphoenix,got it
03-11-2017T01:23:33,crimsonreaper,joking
03-11-2017T01:23:41,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-karenOOO:
03-11-2017T01:23:48,ZRO4825,":thinking: Not sure if actually joking, or just trying to save face"
03-11-2017T01:23:52,SageSaga,Yosh is about - An alternate earth where magic has caused chaos and a group of people working to make the world better - basically
03-11-2017T01:24:19,MarvTheHugPharaoh,and then theres the main cast which is mostly cute cat girls
03-11-2017T01:24:22,unsteddyphoenix,I see~
03-11-2017T01:24:28,unsteddyphoenix,That part I did know
03-11-2017T01:24:58,crimsonreaper,i read yosh i did not dislike it but i think i got bored of it after awile cant remember
03-11-2017T01:25:01,ZRO4825,Still not sure how more people aren't into it. Catgirls = win
03-11-2017T01:25:20,ZRO4825,"To be fair Crimson, the first...what did you say, Sage? 400 pages or so? Were all kinda...unimportant, lol"
03-11-2017T01:25:31,MarvTheHugPharaoh,catgirls &lt; Wolfgirls
03-11-2017T01:25:33,SageSaga,it is not a fast moving adventure
03-11-2017T01:25:41,ZRO4825,"At the beginning it was just kind of a day-to-day random happenings, lol"
03-11-2017T01:26:07,crimsonreaper,"personally i dont care for humanized beast races, i say go full beast race or go home :)"
03-11-2017T01:26:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,like balto?
03-11-2017T01:26:23,SageSaga,Yosh started as a way to joke around with friends on a Message Board back when Message Boards were the coolest thing ever
03-11-2017T01:26:33,crimsonreaper,@ZRO4825 that may be where i got bored :/
03-11-2017T01:27:03,crimsonreaper,yea proves how long Yosh has been running Sage
03-11-2017T01:27:24,ZRO4825,Long damned time &lt;3
03-11-2017T01:27:32,SageSaga,there were entire comics removed involving Phil dressing as Tsubasa from .Hack and Chii from Chobits
03-11-2017T01:27:43,crimsonreaper,one of the reasons message boards where so cool is looking for cheats and secrets for games :P
03-11-2017T01:27:46,ZRO4825,Which I think is part of why I like it. I like long stories. Most of'em die off by now and leave me hanging D:
03-11-2017T01:28:31,crimsonreaper,yea
03-11-2017T01:28:45,crimsonreaper,thats why ive been reading WN lately
03-11-2017T01:29:45,Bgrmystr2,"ooh, so the beginning of Yosh is like slice of Life?"
03-11-2017T01:29:46,SageSaga,Yosh has been going for like a month or two less than Twokinds
03-11-2017T01:30:21,SageSaga,and yeah it was random slice of life- a lot having to do with me not having confidence in doing a long form series- LOOK AT ME NOW! XD
03-11-2017T01:31:05,unsteddyphoenix,Started from the bottom now we here
03-11-2017T01:31:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,pls not that song
03-11-2017T01:31:30,unsteddyphoenix,Ive tried Yosh but I just cant break in. Im all in on AI
03-11-2017T01:31:53,unsteddyphoenix,So...better make it good~
03-11-2017T01:31:53,crimsonreaper,AI?
03-11-2017T01:32:03,ZRO4825,"The comic he's working on now, Artificial Incident"
03-11-2017T01:32:06,unsteddyphoenix,Amoblie intergers
03-11-2017T01:32:06,SageSaga,when Yosh is done- i will probably compress and rewrite Yosh because there is a lot there that IS good and fun - but - yeeeeah
03-11-2017T01:32:27,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Wish you luck with that sage
03-11-2017T01:32:28,unsteddyphoenix,"If you ever though, i'll read that one"
03-11-2017T01:32:31,unsteddyphoenix,*do
03-11-2017T01:32:35,ZRO4825,I didn't even get to see what Pheonix said that time XD
03-11-2017T01:32:47,SageSaga,http://ai.katbox.net/
03-11-2017T01:32:50,ZRO4825,I'm all in for Yosh!
03-11-2017T01:32:51,ZRO4825,And AI
03-11-2017T01:32:53,SageSaga,AI - Artificial Incident
03-11-2017T01:32:54,ZRO4825,and TK
03-11-2017T01:33:01,ZRO4825,And....and I have commitment issues. :rofl:
03-11-2017T01:33:04,unsteddyphoenix,You cant all in on 3 things
03-11-2017T01:33:11,unsteddyphoenix,Thats not how...words work
03-11-2017T01:33:15,ZRO4825,You can if you try hard enough!
03-11-2017T01:33:15,Bgrmystr2,why the hell not
03-11-2017T01:33:20,unsteddyphoenix,...
03-11-2017T01:33:25,crimsonreaper,compressing Yosh would be a huge pain i can just imagine the workload that would entail... ouch -_-
03-11-2017T01:33:33,SageSaga,i can do it
03-11-2017T01:33:37,ZRO4825,Honestly? I don't think it would be THAT hard.
03-11-2017T01:33:39,SageSaga,i have tons i can just cut
03-11-2017T01:33:45,Celestine,sagesaga thank you very much for drawing more of Artificial Intelligence &lt;3
03-11-2017T01:33:46,ZRO4825,There's a lot of it that honestly isn't massively important to storyline.
03-11-2017T01:34:01,Bgrmystr2,"not like sage wasn't gonna do it, Celes xD"
03-11-2017T01:34:04,crimsonreaper,yea never said you couldnt do it :P just saying it would take  along time hehe
03-11-2017T01:34:21,Bgrmystr2,I should get around to reading Yosh
03-11-2017T01:34:27,Bgrmystr2,I wanna read it before it compresses
03-11-2017T01:34:29,ZRO4825,"Could cut like, the first quarter of what's online right now, cuz  it just ain't important, admittedly"
03-11-2017T01:34:51,ZRO4825,"I still enjoy it personally, but it's definitely a point that Yosh! could use a Yosh! Kai!"
03-11-2017T01:35:03,unsteddyphoenix,Yosh Z
03-11-2017T01:35:10,ZRO4825,Kai
03-11-2017T01:35:14,MarvTheHugPharaoh,GT
03-11-2017T01:35:19,ZRO4825,"Kai's the shortened ""no filler"" version :P"
03-11-2017T01:35:19,SageSaga,SUPER
03-11-2017T01:35:34,ZRO4825,"....damnit Sage, now we need Kate going SSGSS D:"
03-11-2017T01:35:36,MarvTheHugPharaoh,DB super is really good right now
03-11-2017T01:35:46,SageSaga,"""None of this makes any sense!"" ""IM SUPER GREEN PHIL!"""
03-11-2017T01:35:49,ZRO4825,"And yes, Super has been good so far &lt;3"
03-11-2017T01:35:59,crimsonreaper,"okay now that ive seen the art for AI i have to read it XD, its very well done"
03-11-2017T01:36:08,ZRO4825,Sage's stuff is awesome ^_^
03-11-2017T01:36:10,unsteddyphoenix,Hahha
03-11-2017T01:36:15,Celestine,well Marv you might feel like that but the rest of us think DBZ Abridged is the only good DBZ :ptv-uneasy:
03-11-2017T01:36:15,SageSaga,oh Zro... we disagree on Super then
03-11-2017T01:36:21,ZRO4825,"I'm the resident mouthy fanboy though, so, my opinion is somewhat biased :thinking:"
03-11-2017T01:36:25,Celestine,or DB period
03-11-2017T01:36:28,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah im with Sage
03-11-2017T01:36:32,ZRO4825,You don't think Super has been good?
03-11-2017T01:36:42,SageSaga,noooo Super has been mostly terrible
03-11-2017T01:36:43,ZRO4825,"I mean, it's had a few spots of bleh, but that's Dragonball period"
03-11-2017T01:36:49,unsteddyphoenix,I was wholly dissapointed
03-11-2017T01:36:50,SageSaga,it has had SOME good
03-11-2017T01:36:50,Celestine,ZRO i think its good at being terrible
03-11-2017T01:36:52,SageSaga,totally
03-11-2017T01:36:54,SageSaga,buuut
03-11-2017T01:36:55,MarvTheHugPharaoh,ultra instinct was badass
03-11-2017T01:37:05,Bgrmystr2,"I consider everything from DB to be Eh overall, but that's more just the core of the story to begin with"
03-11-2017T01:37:08,SageSaga,but it came out of NOWHERER
03-11-2017T01:37:13,SageSaga,without the extra R
03-11-2017T01:37:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,in know but still
03-11-2017T01:37:26,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I
03-11-2017T01:37:29,Bgrmystr2,perhaps the nowhere it came from
03-11-2017T01:37:30,SageSaga,SS was talked about
03-11-2017T01:37:31,ZRO4825,"Yeah, the whole Ultra Instinct thing was kind of a WTF moment admittedly. Fun to see, but still wtf."
03-11-2017T01:37:38,Bgrmystr2,was even more nowherer than nowhere could possibly be
03-11-2017T01:37:39,SageSaga,even God was talked about
03-11-2017T01:37:52,Celestine,DB has always been about martial arts and stuff like that
03-11-2017T01:37:56,Celestine,but
03-11-2017T01:37:57,crimsonreaper,*walks away from DBZ convo*
03-11-2017T01:38:00,Bgrmystr2,Haha
03-11-2017T01:38:06,SageSaga,"Instinct ""Oh crap - how do we make him go beyond god?"""
03-11-2017T01:38:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"too be fair, I think I like it so much because of Akira Kushida's insert song"
03-11-2017T01:38:24,Celestine,what made DBZ so good is that it added a world of depth to the Dragon Ball universe that are otherwise poorly done in other series
03-11-2017T01:38:28,ZRO4825,"Then again, I kind've liked that about Ultra Instinct. BECAUSE it came out of nowhere. There was no talking about breaking the next limit. It just happened."
03-11-2017T01:38:40,Celestine,for example the two main protagonists Alpha Vegeta and Beta Goku
03-11-2017T01:38:45,SageSaga,yeah but thats the crap Bleach did
03-11-2017T01:38:49,ZRO4825,"And now it's ""Well shit, I did it once? Now how the fuck do I do it again?"""
03-11-2017T01:38:57,unsteddyphoenix,"I like how they did god, then god of the gods, now it's like...Another god but...stronger"
03-11-2017T01:38:58,MarvTheHugPharaoh,yeah but bleach did it over and over again
03-11-2017T01:39:09,ZRO4825,"....I liked Bleach, sooo.....Uh... Hi? :rofl:"
03-11-2017T01:39:10,SageSaga,"""I am a hollow shinigami vanguard hellsing vampire bontou Quincy!"""
03-11-2017T01:39:12,Celestine,but anyways what i'm saying is that the series doesn't concentrate on anything Saiyan anymore
03-11-2017T01:39:16,crimsonreaper,"Vegeta? BAHAHAHA tahts a seasoning here, its made from veggies"
03-11-2017T01:39:20,crimsonreaper,thats*
03-11-2017T01:39:21,unsteddyphoenix,Also Vegeta? RUINED
03-11-2017T01:39:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"""also I'm all might"""
03-11-2017T01:39:34,ZRO4825,Vegeta ruined? How so?
03-11-2017T01:39:34,Celestine,or the follow up of who would rule frieza's space napoleon hitler empire
03-11-2017T01:39:35,unsteddyphoenix,How dare you comic relief Vegeta
03-11-2017T01:39:45,SageSaga,i do like how Vegeta wants to go to planet Salad
03-11-2017T01:39:50,Bgrmystr2,I'm just on the sidelines really.
03-11-2017T01:40:11,ZRO4825,And it's kinda gotten back to being about Saiyans atm.
03-11-2017T01:40:11,Celestine,Planet Salad?
03-11-2017T01:40:13,crimsonreaper,Vegeta planet salad? ok that is DEFINATELY a gag charecter
03-11-2017T01:40:21,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I also like how Vegeta's wish is for others and not himself
03-11-2017T01:40:28,ZRO4825,"Crimson, the Saiyans are almost all play-on-words names for different veggies."
03-11-2017T01:40:28,SageSaga,Planet Salada or something like that- it's Salad XD
03-11-2017T01:40:37,unsteddyphoenix,Hahaha really?
03-11-2017T01:40:42,ZRO4825,Yeah
03-11-2017T01:40:46,Celestine,"ZRO if it wants to get back into saiyans and being good, its going to have to runescape it and delete the past decades worth of crap its added to the series"
03-11-2017T01:40:52,unsteddyphoenix,Im both mad and amused
03-11-2017T01:41:00,Bgrmystr2,"the veggie things I can confirm, that was the entire joke from the start lol"
03-11-2017T01:41:12,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"kakarot-carrot, Vegeta-vegetable"
03-11-2017T01:41:22,SageSaga,and all the Veggies are found in the final boss-
03-11-2017T01:41:25,Celestine,piccolo pickle
03-11-2017T01:41:26,SageSaga,The Frieza
03-11-2017T01:41:31,ZRO4825,":thinking: So, wait, you're thinking somehow that it's NOT about the Saiyans at this point? Even though Goku and Vegeta have been pretty much the only main characters that mattered since the Saiyan Saga? O_o"
03-11-2017T01:41:36,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"king cold, cooler"
03-11-2017T01:41:40,unsteddyphoenix,Haha
03-11-2017T01:41:44,Celestine,oh shit sage
03-11-2017T01:41:48,Celestine,that was really good!
03-11-2017T01:41:51,unsteddyphoenix,"None of that was intentional by the creator, right?"
03-11-2017T01:41:58,unsteddyphoenix,"Well, apart from freiza and cooler"
03-11-2017T01:42:00,SageSaga,its truly how he came up with it all
03-11-2017T01:42:07,ZRO4825,"Actually, Piccolo is a reference to the instrument. As was King Piccolo's group, which was Cymbal and Tambourine."
03-11-2017T01:42:09,unsteddyphoenix,Amazing
03-11-2017T01:42:09,Celestine,brilliant
03-11-2017T01:42:21,SageSaga,it was totally intentional - its like he couldnt come up with a name sooo-
03-11-2017T01:42:25,Celestine,SHUT UP ZRO ITS PICKLE!

03-11-2017T01:42:34,Celestine,he's even green and bumpy for christ's sake
03-11-2017T01:42:35,unsteddyphoenix,What the hell lol
03-11-2017T01:42:39,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Dragon ball was written with ""convenience"" in mind"
03-11-2017T01:42:41,Bgrmystr2,he couldn't think of names so he just used those
03-11-2017T01:42:49,Bgrmystr2,yeah marv's got it
03-11-2017T01:42:52,unsteddyphoenix,I know they like to throw some english in there but...cmon

03-11-2017T01:43:16,crimsonreaper,no wonder i could never get into DBZ...
03-11-2017T01:43:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"in super there is a character named after the word ""urine"""
03-11-2017T01:43:28,Celestine,i'm sorry but i can never think of piccolo without thinking of pickle and ONEYG cartoons agrees with me
03-11-2017T01:43:46,Bgrmystr2,The fact that there exists Bulma and Trunks..
03-11-2017T01:43:55,MarvTheHugPharaoh,and bra
03-11-2017T01:43:55,Celestine,the Briefs
03-11-2017T01:43:57,Bgrmystr2,IKR
03-11-2017T01:44:00,Bgrmystr2,Like
03-11-2017T01:44:01,MarvTheHugPharaoh,and Pan
03-11-2017T01:44:03,unsteddyphoenix,When Cashew has to save the world from an evil intergalatic overlord then i'll call it a bit silly
03-11-2017T01:44:04,SageSaga,and there used to be Bra but she doesnt exist anymore
03-11-2017T01:44:04,Bgrmystr2,SEE
03-11-2017T01:44:18,Bgrmystr2,like.. you can't even second guess anymore
03-11-2017T01:44:18,SageSaga,Bra is forever lost
03-11-2017T01:44:20,unsteddyphoenix,Bulma?
03-11-2017T01:44:30,Celestine,"The Brief Familys consists of Bulma Bulma's Dad, Bulma's Mom, Bra,, and Trunks"
03-11-2017T01:44:30,unsteddyphoenix,Whats that a reference to
03-11-2017T01:44:34,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Bulma briefs
03-11-2017T01:44:39,Bgrmystr2,bulma was the english interpretation of bloomers
03-11-2017T01:44:53,Bgrmystr2,it was basically a phonetic of how they pronounce it
03-11-2017T01:44:59,Celestine,so her japanese name is bloomers :T
03-11-2017T01:45:03,Bgrmystr2,and then transferred into english
03-11-2017T01:45:04,MarvTheHugPharaoh,yes
03-11-2017T01:45:06,unsteddyphoenix,...oh my god
03-11-2017T01:45:07,Bgrmystr2,"yeah basically, Celes"
03-11-2017T01:45:12,unsteddyphoenix,This is fucking me up
03-11-2017T01:45:21,Bgrmystr2,"It's a thing, phoenix"
03-11-2017T01:45:21,Celestine,same here unsteddy
03-11-2017T01:45:25,Bgrmystr2,from the very beginning
03-11-2017T01:45:26,SageSaga,and Hercule is Mr Satan
03-11-2017T01:45:31,Celestine,and i'm about two hours into a good high
03-11-2017T01:45:33,Bgrmystr2,yeah
03-11-2017T01:45:42,unsteddyphoenix,So why is he called Satan then?
03-11-2017T01:45:47,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hercule is the true savoir of the universe
03-11-2017T01:45:55,Celestine,Marv
03-11-2017T01:45:59,unsteddyphoenix,Hercule strongest character
03-11-2017T01:46:03,Celestine,you're actually thinking of Hodor
03-11-2017T01:46:04,Bgrmystr2,lool
03-11-2017T01:46:07,SageSaga,English version censored him to Hercule
03-11-2017T01:46:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,until Kai was released on blu-ray
03-11-2017T01:46:37,SageSaga,"they didnt think parents would like hearing their kids listen to people chant ""SATAN! SATAN! SATAN!"""
03-11-2017T01:46:43,unsteddyphoenix,"I knew that one, but why did he call him Satan?"
03-11-2017T01:46:44,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
03-11-2017T01:46:49,ZRO4825,Original uncensored version was calling him Satan as well
03-11-2017T01:46:58,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Toriyama thought it would be funny
03-11-2017T01:47:01,crimsonreaper,i can stop thinking of that veggietales pirate tv movie or w/e it was
03-11-2017T01:47:03,Bgrmystr2,I don't actually recall what was behind the name Satan
03-11-2017T01:47:05,ZRO4825,It's just the censored for TV version that was calling him Hercule~
03-11-2017T01:47:59,unsteddyphoenix,Im pretty sure Satan isnt vegetable related...
03-11-2017T01:48:09,Bgrmystr2,"well, Bulma isn't"
03-11-2017T01:48:11,unsteddyphoenix,Unless you believe what they say about vegans...
03-11-2017T01:48:13,Bgrmystr2,xD
03-11-2017T01:48:15,MarvTheHugPharaoh,or trunks
03-11-2017T01:48:23,Bgrmystr2,haha
03-11-2017T01:48:23,SageSaga,Satan was after the Frieza saga
03-11-2017T01:48:30,crimsonreaper,theres that one hot sauce that has his name on it...
03-11-2017T01:48:34,ZRO4825,"Nope. Because his family is based on ""evil"" names. Satan, and his daughter is Videl. Which is a mix-up of Devil."
03-11-2017T01:48:35,MarvTheHugPharaoh,during the Cell games
03-11-2017T01:48:38,Celestine,Satan is the rule of a fiery place
03-11-2017T01:48:39,unsteddyphoenix,"Mr. Satan, Videl, Pan?"
03-11-2017T01:48:46,Celestine,and vegetables get cooked in hell
03-11-2017T01:48:49,SageSaga,Videl is so hot
03-11-2017T01:48:52,SageSaga,i mean
03-11-2017T01:48:52,ZRO4825,Yesh!

03-11-2017T01:48:57,Celestine,would tap
03-11-2017T01:48:57,SageSaga,&lt;_&lt;
03-11-2017T01:48:59,Celestine,10/10
03-11-2017T01:49:01,MarvTheHugPharaoh,18 is great
03-11-2017T01:49:03,Bgrmystr2,"Oh right, cuz her name was that mixup of the word devil yeah"
03-11-2017T01:49:11,MarvTheHugPharaoh,17 is kicking ass too
03-11-2017T01:49:12,ZRO4825,18 is amazing &lt;3
03-11-2017T01:49:13,Bgrmystr2,I don't remember what the word for that was
03-11-2017T01:49:16,SageSaga,18 is my favorite but Videl is cute and toned
03-11-2017T01:49:20,Celestine,not videl
03-11-2017T01:49:23,Celestine,i mean videl
03-11-2017T01:49:24,Celestine,not 18
03-11-2017T01:49:25,ZRO4825,"Android 21 from the new Dragonball Fighter Z game though, err mah gerd &lt;3"
03-11-2017T01:49:27,unsteddyphoenix,Ohhh shit youre right
03-11-2017T01:49:29,unsteddyphoenix,I knew that actually
03-11-2017T01:49:42,Celestine,Videl with short hair is the greatest thing in this series
03-11-2017T01:50:06,Celestine,right next to Universe Six's super saiyan girl
03-11-2017T01:50:11,Celestine,at least i think its universe six
03-11-2017T01:50:15,ZRO4825,"Trunks is because Bulma's family names are all underwear of some sort. Bulma bloomers like we said. But also, Dr. Briefs. Trunks. Their daughter is Bulla which was a translation of Bra."
03-11-2017T01:50:16,SageSaga,Videl in biker shorts is the best thing
03-11-2017T01:50:18,Celestine,but that super saiyan girl is smoking
03-11-2017T01:50:27,ZRO4825,Yeah. Caulifla
03-11-2017T01:50:31,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Vados I think is best
03-11-2017T01:50:34,ZRO4825,Saiyan name....cauliflower....
03-11-2017T01:50:41,Bgrmystr2,XDD
03-11-2017T01:50:42,Celestine,Trunks is DBZ's most beautiful princess yes
03-11-2017T01:50:42,ZRO4825,"Also, Kale. which is an herb...."
03-11-2017T01:50:47,Celestine,all hail princess Trunks
03-11-2017T01:50:49,Bgrmystr2,The names CONTINUE
03-11-2017T01:50:50,unsteddyphoenix,Hahhaa
03-11-2017T01:50:50,Bgrmystr2,XD
03-11-2017T01:50:52,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
03-11-2017T01:51:17,crimsonreaper,"Kale is not a herb, its just vegatation like lettuce"
03-11-2017T01:51:24,unsteddyphoenix,Haha he got called princess what a dork.
03-11-2017T01:51:39,MarvTheHugPharaoh,..... yes

03-11-2017T01:52:11,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"it will be back, just stuff came up"
03-11-2017T01:52:17,crimsonreaper,the A stands for what? amazing?
03-11-2017T01:52:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,abridge
03-11-2017T01:52:28,crimsonreaper,ah
03-11-2017T01:52:32,unsteddyphoenix,*[𝐈 𝐀 𝐌 𝐓 𝐇 𝐄 𝐇 𝐘 𝐏 𝐄]
03-11-2017T01:52:38,SageSaga,they arent talking about the stuff though- which makes me think its LEGAL stuff which is very bad
03-11-2017T01:52:50,crimsonreaper,yea thats never good
03-11-2017T01:52:52,unsteddyphoenix,Ahh
03-11-2017T01:53:02,crimsonreaper,its either funding or legal
03-11-2017T01:53:08,Celestine,legal
03-11-2017T01:53:09,unsteddyphoenix,I suppose since Super is going on they might care more now
03-11-2017T01:53:09,SageSaga,cuz they cant win a legal fight - it isnt funding
03-11-2017T01:53:31,Celestine,those guys could become millionaires overnight
03-11-2017T01:53:37,Celestine,if they started a patreon or something
03-11-2017T01:53:43,ZRO4825,"Actually, I believe what they said it is is that they're being contracted to do ACTUAL anime voice-overs."
03-11-2017T01:53:44,SageSaga,they have a patreon
03-11-2017T01:54:06,Bgrmystr2,"Sage, I had a question. Is Kaylin going to meet that wolf again? Or is that spoilers?"
03-11-2017T01:54:17,Celestine,oh well i stand mistaken
03-11-2017T01:54:20,SageSaga,the wolf is gone
03-11-2017T01:54:21,MarvTheHugPharaoh,that wolf was badass
03-11-2017T01:54:26,Bgrmystr2,noo
03-11-2017T01:54:32,Bgrmystr2,:(
03-11-2017T01:54:33,crimsonreaper,sage just gave a spoiler O_O
03-11-2017T01:54:38,SageSaga,:P
03-11-2017T01:54:39,Bgrmystr2,SPOILERS@
03-11-2017T01:54:41,unsteddyphoenix,goodbye forever wolfu
03-11-2017T01:54:50,SageSaga,but am i spoiling or lying?
03-11-2017T01:54:53,Celestine,you know an anime that was actually SEMI decent?
03-11-2017T01:54:56,Celestine,Spice and Wolf
03-11-2017T01:54:56,Bgrmystr2,Will maybe she get another? :o
03-11-2017T01:55:01,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Unsteddy if you need more dbza Vegeta goodness watch the Renegade for Life on TFS gaming
03-11-2017T01:55:08,crimsonreaper,speaking of wolves im staring and my giant banner poster of one right now :D
03-11-2017T01:55:09,SageSaga,Spice and Wolf was fun
03-11-2017T01:55:22,ZRO4825,Spice and Wolf. Holo is love. Holo is life. &lt;3
03-11-2017T01:55:28,SageSaga,btw TFS used to make like 30k a month on their patreon
03-11-2017T01:55:32,unsteddyphoenix,Will eventually read
03-11-2017T01:55:37,unsteddyphoenix,"Woah, damn"
03-11-2017T01:55:44,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, if something took to their habitat, and pushed them out, then obviously there should be more than one displaced.. I would hope she runs into another when she's more prepared."
03-11-2017T01:55:44,unsteddyphoenix,Nostalgia is powerful
03-11-2017T01:55:45,Celestine,oh what happened?
03-11-2017T01:55:47,crimsonreaper,thats godly to me *_*
03-11-2017T01:55:55,SageSaga,now its down to 12k a month- not bad - but a lot of people dropped when they said no more DBZA till they worked something out
03-11-2017T01:56:04,Celestine,aaaah
03-11-2017T01:56:10,Celestine,ouch
03-11-2017T01:56:13,unsteddyphoenix,Makes sense
03-11-2017T01:56:14,Celestine,like a kick to the dick
03-11-2017T01:56:20,unsteddyphoenix,They'd probably come back once it's sorted
03-11-2017T01:56:20,SageSaga,but- the Patreon was NEVER about paying for DBZA
03-11-2017T01:56:25,crimsonreaper,yea thats a big differance
03-11-2017T01:56:36,ZRO4825,"At this point, I think it might hurt Fuji/funimation more to try and shut down DBZA than it would to let it keep going."
03-11-2017T01:56:43,ZRO4825,Because they'd piss off a LOT of people...
03-11-2017T01:56:48,Celestine,A LOT
03-11-2017T01:57:14,crimsonreaper,im still upset about there being no se3 of spice and wolf T_T
03-11-2017T01:57:18,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"toei animation is the butt hurt one, Zro"
03-11-2017T01:57:36,SageSaga,that said- still having that much support is amazing and goes to show just how awesome the guys are
03-11-2017T01:57:45,Celestine,me too crimson me too
03-11-2017T01:57:52,ZRO4825,"Yeah. But no matter how butthurt they might be, they have to realize that if even a HINT of the fact that they forced it to shut down gets out....that's gonna be SO much backlash..."
03-11-2017T01:57:54,SageSaga,and yeah- a lot of them work with Funimation
03-11-2017T01:58:03,Celestine,say sage
03-11-2017T01:58:04,SageSaga,they are very good friends over all
03-11-2017T01:58:17,SageSaga,?
03-11-2017T01:58:20,Bgrmystr2,yeah the fandom will be very unhappy
03-11-2017T01:58:23,unsteddyphoenix,I feel like the backlash would be fairly small in the overall scheme of things
03-11-2017T01:58:32,Bgrmystr2,"well, of course"
03-11-2017T01:58:35,crimsonreaper,i agree
03-11-2017T01:58:38,Celestine,out of curiosity would you be interested in moving into an apartment complex full of other artists?
03-11-2017T01:58:55,unsteddyphoenix,They probably could get away with it fairly unscathed. I dont really know what harm there is in leaving TFS alone though
03-11-2017T01:58:55,SageSaga,i couldnt afford it
03-11-2017T01:58:58,Bgrmystr2,cuz everything over on this side of the Pacific means literally nothing to the creation of dragonball
03-11-2017T01:59:03,unsteddyphoenix,"Theyre not even abridging super, are they?"
03-11-2017T01:59:04,Bgrmystr2,or the company that funds it
03-11-2017T01:59:17,ZRO4825,"They did some scenes out of it phoenix, but for some reason it's not on their channels."
03-11-2017T01:59:24,Celestine,oh?
03-11-2017T01:59:25,ZRO4825,Can find'em on other channels though.
03-11-2017T01:59:33,Celestine,I was thinking about something like 500$ a month for rent
03-11-2017T01:59:44,Celestine,utilities included :ptv-uneasy:
03-11-2017T01:59:50,SageSaga,couldnt afford that
03-11-2017T02:00:01,Celestine,what about with a roomie?
03-11-2017T02:00:01,crimsonreaper,how much are you paying now? nothing?
03-11-2017T02:00:02,unsteddyphoenix,"'cause they were forced to have them taken down, probably"
03-11-2017T02:00:27,SageSaga,im paying about 200
03-11-2017T02:00:36,crimsonreaper,wow thats cheap
03-11-2017T02:00:46,unsteddyphoenix,Celes boudda propose over here
03-11-2017T02:01:02,unsteddyphoenix,"Ah, foods here. Gotta bail"

03-11-2017T02:02:42,ZRO4825,"I am so confused. I want to hate people for ordering pizza and making my job harder. But if they did not order pizza, I would have no job at all."
03-11-2017T02:02:49,crimsonreaper,so sage i imagine you live in a single room student type residance then?
03-11-2017T02:03:09,MarvTheHugPharaoh,he lives in castle super beast
03-11-2017T02:03:18,Celestine,he is a hermit in a cave
03-11-2017T02:03:22,crimsonreaper,ZRO4825 you do deliveries as a job?
03-11-2017T02:03:24,Celestine,with wifi to the local hotel
03-11-2017T02:03:27,Bgrmystr2,"Oh, I was gonna say under a bridge, Celes"

03-11-2017T02:03:37,Bgrmystr2,not sure if that's any better or worse than cave
03-11-2017T02:03:41,Celestine,Arakawa already beat him to that bgrmystr
03-11-2017T02:03:50,Bgrmystr2,ikr

03-11-2017T02:04:33,Bgrmystr2,no I didn't. I am but a simple rock you speak to. :(
03-11-2017T02:04:34,ZRO4825,"You too, Sage? lol"
03-11-2017T02:04:35,crimsonreaper,yea XD

03-11-2017T02:04:37,Celestine,FUCK
03-11-2017T02:04:39,MarvTheHugPharaoh,thats me too
03-11-2017T02:04:48,Celestine,You said sage was a hermit under a bridge
03-11-2017T02:04:51,Celestine,or were going to
03-11-2017T02:05:00,Bgrmystr2,"no, just living under a bridge"
03-11-2017T02:05:01,Bgrmystr2,xD
03-11-2017T02:05:09,Celestine,and there's an anime called arakawa under the bridge which is pretty much exactly just that
03-11-2017T02:05:14,SageSaga,man i wish i could afford a place under the bridge
03-11-2017T02:05:17,Celestine,same dif
03-11-2017T02:05:18,SageSaga,thats water front though
03-11-2017T02:05:24,crimsonreaper,LOL
03-11-2017T02:05:27,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
03-11-2017T02:05:29,Bgrmystr2,xDDD
03-11-2017T02:05:40,Bgrmystr2,never actually heard of Arakawa
03-11-2017T02:05:50,crimsonreaper,im going to look that up
03-11-2017T02:06:05,SageSaga,if yall look at my Patreon - that's my income
03-11-2017T02:06:25,SageSaga,its not good and its not easy to live on
03-11-2017T02:06:28,ZRO4825,I'm trying to find more to throw at it! D:
03-11-2017T02:06:29,Celestine,if you did porn commissions you'd earn a little more than that i'm sure =w=
03-11-2017T02:06:40,Bgrmystr2,"at this point, I'm lucky to even have firefox playing your stream."
03-11-2017T02:06:54,Bgrmystr2,cuz everything is super slow
03-11-2017T02:06:57,SageSaga,XD ive thought about going to the dark side
03-11-2017T02:07:07,ZRO4825,"wth did you do to your Firefox THIS time, Bgr? XD"
03-11-2017T02:07:15,Celestine,more like the pleasurable side amiright?
03-11-2017T02:07:25,ZRO4825,"Just cuz it's fun, doesn't mean it's not dark~"
03-11-2017T02:07:27,Bgrmystr2,"nothing, I'm in the middle of diagnosing the extent of the damage to this laptop HD"
03-11-2017T02:07:45,MarvTheHugPharaoh,what did you do to the laptop this time
03-11-2017T02:07:54,Bgrmystr2,Not mine
03-11-2017T02:07:57,Bgrmystr2,a school laptop
03-11-2017T02:08:00,Bgrmystr2,was dropped 3 times
03-11-2017T02:08:11,SageSaga,the adult Katbox is literally called after dark so- dark side
03-11-2017T02:08:19,Bgrmystr2,has 151 Current Pending Sectors
03-11-2017T02:08:19,MarvTheHugPharaoh,stop dropping shit and maybe they would last longer
03-11-2017T02:08:27,crimsonreaper,so your only incone is from your patreon?
03-11-2017T02:08:28,Bgrmystr2,Ain't my fault
03-11-2017T02:08:31,Bgrmystr2,I don't go to school
03-11-2017T02:08:43,ZRO4825,"iirc, the ads on Katbox and such don't add up to much at all~"
03-11-2017T02:08:45,MarvTheHugPharaoh,you stool a school laptop?
03-11-2017T02:08:46,Bgrmystr2,the laptop comes from a special education classroom
03-11-2017T02:08:54,ZRO4825,"So yeah, pretty much all he's got is Patreon :x"
03-11-2017T02:08:55,Bgrmystr2,"no, one of the teachers brought it to me to diagnose"
03-11-2017T02:09:05,SageSaga,Patreon is 99% of all my income
03-11-2017T02:09:09,MarvTheHugPharaoh,sounds like a lazy teacher
03-11-2017T02:09:11,crimsonreaper,uh wow
03-11-2017T02:09:14,Bgrmystr2,naw marv
03-11-2017T02:09:23,Bgrmystr2,the school would take it and promise to fix it
03-11-2017T02:09:23,crimsonreaper,you still make 6x what i do though :P
03-11-2017T02:09:30,SageSaga,the other 1% is the occasional non-patreon commission work i get
03-11-2017T02:09:31,Bgrmystr2,then wait till the end of the year and do NOTHING about it
03-11-2017T02:09:38,MarvTheHugPharaoh,true
03-11-2017T02:09:41,Bgrmystr2,and they have no laptop till the end of the year
03-11-2017T02:09:54,Bgrmystr2,so the school tech office is completely worthless
03-11-2017T02:10:21,Bgrmystr2,so I'm just doin what I can to help :c
03-11-2017T02:10:22,SageSaga,though i am going to do a print run of Artificial Incident after chapter 5
03-11-2017T02:10:25,SageSaga,hope that sells
03-11-2017T02:10:38,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Awesome
03-11-2017T02:10:52,crimsonreaper,"well, the real question is how many will sell?"
03-11-2017T02:10:56,Bgrmystr2,"hope it works for you, Sage"
03-11-2017T02:11:05,ZRO4825,I'll buy it~
03-11-2017T02:11:16,crimsonreaper,see i knew some people would jump on it XD
03-11-2017T02:11:45,SageSaga,i know some people will buy it- over 200 people bought my Anniversary art book and that was 4 years ago
03-11-2017T02:12:12,crimsonreaper,thats not bad actually
03-11-2017T02:12:13,Bgrmystr2,"it can't just be some people though, reaper. It needs to outsell the cost of making them"
03-11-2017T02:12:24,crimsonreaper,i know that Bgr
03-11-2017T02:12:30,Bgrmystr2,I know it ain't cheap
03-11-2017T02:12:31,SageSaga,whats really not bad about it is i didnt have to spend any money on it myself
03-11-2017T02:12:37,Bgrmystr2,really
03-11-2017T02:12:41,Bgrmystr2,that's actually really good
03-11-2017T02:12:48,crimsonreaper,how did you swing that?
03-11-2017T02:13:12,SageSaga,i had 80 preorders- and used that money to print the books and pay for all the shipping - got extra books printed and sold those separately
03-11-2017T02:13:29,Bgrmystr2,ooh
03-11-2017T02:13:33,crimsonreaper,ahhhh gotcha
03-11-2017T02:13:34,Bgrmystr2,you still handled the costs
03-11-2017T02:13:42,Bgrmystr2,but it didn't come out of pocket
03-11-2017T02:13:53,Bgrmystr2,that's not bad
03-11-2017T02:13:58,SageSaga,all costs were paid out of preorders - like a kickstarter but not kickstarter
03-11-2017T02:14:01,crimsonreaper,"there was no investment cost, but it was also not free"
03-11-2017T02:14:10,Bgrmystr2,yeah reaper
03-11-2017T02:14:21,Bgrmystr2,"hopefully you can get a similar setup to work again, Sage"
03-11-2017T02:14:32,crimsonreaper,when you first said it i thought you meant it was literally free XD
03-11-2017T02:14:46,SageSaga,nah if it was free i would have said free
03-11-2017T02:15:09,crimsonreaper,good point
03-11-2017T02:15:13,SageSaga,having a venture pay for itself means total profit
03-11-2017T02:15:24,Bgrmystr2,well
03-11-2017T02:15:26,Bgrmystr2,more like net gain
03-11-2017T02:15:27,SageSaga,i even had special artist editions printed and sent to everyone who helped with the book
03-11-2017T02:15:33,ZRO4825,"I need to start doing like...daily practice at drawing or something. This ""occasionally load up CLIP and attempt to do something"" isn't doing much for improving my meager skills..."
03-11-2017T02:15:36,Bgrmystr2,cuz profit doesn't include bills
03-11-2017T02:15:46,SageSaga,net gain is the correct lingo but its the same
03-11-2017T02:15:56,crimsonreaper,yea
03-11-2017T02:16:04,SageSaga,there was no loss
03-11-2017T02:16:16,Kamui,"also, wrt Team Four Star and Funi: Funimation recently got bought"
03-11-2017T02:16:21,Kamui,by Sony Pictures.
03-11-2017T02:16:22,SageSaga,so many people buy a bunch of stuff and never sell it all
03-11-2017T02:16:37,SageSaga,and its even worse when they dont even sell enough to break even
03-11-2017T02:16:41,Kamui,So basically DBZA is dead because Sony.
03-11-2017T02:16:55,SageSaga,oh jeez
03-11-2017T02:16:59,SageSaga,that makes sense
03-11-2017T02:17:19,ZRO4825,"lol. I could set my OBS up to stream my CLIP, but right now it'd be more for people to watch me go ""draw line. Nope, Undo. Draw line. Nope, undo. Draw line. Nope, undo."" XD"
03-11-2017T02:17:33,crimsonreaper,"ah my nail just broke, same with my heart... funimation got baught by sony... now they will not produce nearly as many good things"
03-11-2017T02:17:41,SageSaga,if it was another company they could be OK but Sony is a Japanese company- uhg
03-11-2017T02:17:43,Kamui,demonstrate your feelings by mailing sony packages full of adam sandler movies and human feces
03-11-2017T02:18:19,crimsonreaper,id rather mail them a justin beiber cencert *shudder*
03-11-2017T02:18:25,SageSaga,the Japanese generally dont get the concept of things like abridged series and lets plays driving interest in their work
03-11-2017T02:18:52,ZRO4825,"Ya know, sometimes a thing I don't understand. Companies buy other companies because they're doing well. Which I understand. But then they go in and decide they need to CHANGE the way it works....which...ISN'T why it was doing well to begin with..."
03-11-2017T02:19:11,SageSaga,Zro you are missing something there
03-11-2017T02:19:22,SageSaga,companies being bought out are usually for sale for a reason
03-11-2017T02:19:24,ZRO4825,the money?
03-11-2017T02:19:28,crimsonreaper,sometimes they buy a company just to drive it into the ground
03-11-2017T02:19:49,SageSaga,you generally dont buy a company because things are going soooo well - that is expensive
03-11-2017T02:20:09,Bgrmystr2,you usually see startups bought like that
03-11-2017T02:20:14,Bgrmystr2,or companies losing money
03-11-2017T02:20:21,Kamui,"unless you're sony, who are bleeding money in every direction and only ever just flail around"
03-11-2017T02:20:23,ZRO4825,"Eh, I suppose. But it seems like we never hear about companies NOT doing well, being bought, and doing better. It's almost always either companies doing well, get bought out, and go to crap. Or companies are doing middling to bad, and get bought out."
03-11-2017T02:20:24,Bgrmystr2,those are the ones being bought by bigger corps
03-11-2017T02:20:31,crimsonreaper,"yea most companies are not agressively purchased, they are AcQUIRED"
03-11-2017T02:20:45,ZRO4825,"Stocks buyouts and such, aye."
03-11-2017T02:21:26,crimsonreaper,"companies dont leak info about them doing bad, cause well its bad for business :P"
03-11-2017T02:21:47,crimsonreaper,lowers their buyout value for one even if they DID want to sell they could be baught for a song
03-11-2017T02:21:49,Bgrmystr2,"bah, gotta brb, hope you're still streaming when I get back ;&lt;"
03-11-2017T02:22:08,SageSaga,that technically means that TFS has contracts WITH Sony
03-11-2017T02:22:20,crimsonreaper,TFS?
03-11-2017T02:22:22,SageSaga,which is really bad news if they are saying to stop
03-11-2017T02:22:25,SageSaga,Team Four Star
03-11-2017T02:22:25,MarvTheHugPharaoh,team four star
03-11-2017T02:22:28,crimsonreaper,ah
03-11-2017T02:22:51,SageSaga,"thats a lot worse than just ""Hey- we own it now- so stop"""
03-11-2017T02:23:00,SageSaga,"its like ""We own it- and you now- SO STOP"""
03-11-2017T02:23:04,ZRO4825,Yar :(
03-11-2017T02:24:17,SageSaga,now hopefully- they will have enough sway to get permission to basically close out DBZA - and do a big DBSuper Promotion
03-11-2017T02:24:48,Celestine,maybe
03-11-2017T02:24:48,crimsonreaper,if they are vlosed out doubt that will happen
03-11-2017T02:24:54,crimsonreaper,closed*
03-11-2017T02:24:59,SageSaga,"if they push ""DBZA is to get people excited for DB as a series"" it could work"
03-11-2017T02:25:06,Celestine,its because they're trying to end DBZA that these legal proceedings have emerged
03-11-2017T02:25:09,crimsonreaper,maybe
03-11-2017T02:25:22,SageSaga,actually-
03-11-2017T02:25:26,crimsonreaper,but sony is a rigid company
03-11-2017T02:25:32,Celestine,if DBZA was ended it would likely reduce profit for the company that owns Dragonball
03-11-2017T02:25:48,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Dbza is what got me into dragon ball to begin with
03-11-2017T02:25:59,Celestine,think of how much DBZA has gotten people back into the franchise
03-11-2017T02:26:02,SageSaga,"it seems more likely that Funimation let them know ahead of time that ""We are being bought by Sony- this could affect you- we recommend putting a hault asap until something is worked out"""
03-11-2017T02:26:05,Celestine,see?
03-11-2017T02:26:39,Celestine,ah
03-11-2017T02:26:40,Celestine,or that
03-11-2017T02:26:52,SageSaga,and they couldnt talk about it because NDA's usually prevent people from releasing information about buy outs to prevent competition
03-11-2017T02:27:04,SageSaga,so they would have to be quiet about why
03-11-2017T02:27:46,crimsonreaper,and now im thinking about dungeon runner and how its probably blizzard that shut down that game forever
03-11-2017T02:29:30,ZRO4825,"Blizzard doesn't really have a habit of shutting games down to my knowledge. They seem to usually operate on ""Oh, that's a good idea...join us."" At least that's how it seems to me."
03-11-2017T02:29:51,crimsonreaper,you would be surprised blizzard is pretty ruthless
03-11-2017T02:30:09,SageSaga,yeah Blizzard isnt the sharing type
03-11-2017T02:30:14,ZRO4825,Oh now THAT I'm not surprised about. But if they see something they think is potentially profitable? They like to pull it in.
03-11-2017T02:30:30,ZRO4825,Or shut it down and THEN use the idea themselves. Whatever works. :P
03-11-2017T02:30:56,crimsonreaper,"dungeon runners was farily popular but not all the profitable, and honestly blizzard wanted to shut down all games similar to wow"
03-11-2017T02:31:04,SageSaga,kinda like how Overwatch almost got cancelled
03-11-2017T02:31:45,crimsonreaper,doesnt surprise me
03-11-2017T02:32:19,crimsonreaper,i also wouldnt be surprised if blizzard somehow cause my favorite mmo to crash and burn
03-11-2017T02:32:21,Kamui,blizzard is activision
03-11-2017T02:32:32,crimsonreaper,yea? and?
03-11-2017T02:32:41,Kamui,activision is super cutthroat and awful and has been for over a decade.
03-11-2017T02:32:43,ZRO4825,Blizzard is owned by Activision. Bit of a difference.
03-11-2017T02:33:10,ZRO4825,"And iirc, Overwatch was actually part of the ideas that were Project Titan at one point, which DID get canceled."
03-11-2017T02:33:13,crimsonreaper,ea is in many ways than activision tho tho
03-11-2017T02:33:29,crimsonreaper,ways worse*
03-11-2017T02:33:49,crimsonreaper,speaking of i wonder where that vid went...
03-11-2017T02:34:25,ZRO4825,"WTH Picarto, y u stop stream? D:"
03-11-2017T02:34:37,ZRO4825,That's twice it's done that to me with Sage's stream tonight &gt;:(
03-11-2017T02:35:00,SageSaga,streaming 6 hours- not a single frame dropped
03-11-2017T02:35:12,MarvTheHugPharaoh,woohoo
03-11-2017T02:35:15,ZRO4825,"Oh, yeah, it's not you. It's just Picarto being a pain in my ass."
03-11-2017T02:35:15,SageSaga,i love you awesome computer named Toyoko
03-11-2017T02:35:22,ZRO4825,I love Toyoko too.
03-11-2017T02:35:27,MarvTheHugPharaoh,me too
03-11-2017T02:35:27,ZRO4825,Wait...
03-11-2017T02:35:35,crimsonreaper,hey sage mind if i link a vid? its not crass or anything just fun :)
03-11-2017T02:35:37,ZRO4825,"Meh, fuckit! \[T]/"
03-11-2017T02:35:42,MarvTheHugPharaoh,\[T]/
03-11-2017T02:35:42,SageSaga,my desktop is always named Toyoko because its the biggest
03-11-2017T02:35:59,ZRO4825,I approve of this naming process.
03-11-2017T02:36:01,SageSaga,you need to say what it is you want to link

03-11-2017T02:41:23,crimsonreaper,so sage your saying you live and die by the net huh? most appropiate considering patreon is your lifeline
03-11-2017T02:41:27,ZRO4825,Definitely seeing why you do lineart in Vector layer Sage. this works out so much nicer than using a silly raster layer
03-11-2017T02:41:32,SageSaga,"and i can go ""Thats my cell, that's my computer, that's my tablet-"""

03-11-2017T02:43:32,crimsonreaper,LOL
03-11-2017T02:44:25,SageSaga,"""Your computer keeps trying to reconnect to the network- you probably messed with your network settings-"" ""I was trying to get the printer-"""

03-11-2017T02:46:17,SageSaga,well he likes it for Crafting and survival
03-11-2017T02:46:26,SageSaga,but he wont play Minecraft &lt;_&lt;
03-11-2017T02:46:37,SageSaga,Minecraft is so much better for that XD
03-11-2017T02:46:54,SageSaga,i think Space Engineers would be too much for him
03-11-2017T02:47:02,Bgrmystr2,I am the back :D
03-11-2017T02:47:03,crimsonreaper,"well stranded 3 is coming out around the turn of the year, that should be great"
03-11-2017T02:47:05,Bgrmystr2,and you're still here!
03-11-2017T02:47:12,Bgrmystr2,he won't play minecraft? Kinda sad
03-11-2017T02:47:15,SageSaga,Stranded 3? hadnt heard of that

03-11-2017T02:47:30,crimsonreaper,stranded 2 is free you should see if he enjoys it
03-11-2017T02:47:32,SageSaga,yeah im done for tonight but id like to talk a bit
03-11-2017T02:47:44,Bgrmystr2,"MC is pretty fun, though you gotta go into it knowing what to expect"
03-11-2017T02:47:58,SageSaga,i'll be coloring AI Saturday at 3pm EDT
03-11-2017T02:48:03,Bgrmystr2,page looks good

03-11-2017T02:48:21,MarvTheHugPharaoh,looks great Sage
03-11-2017T02:48:24,SageSaga,thanks
03-11-2017T02:48:38,SageSaga,anyone have recommendations for Survival Crafting games for my dad?
03-11-2017T02:49:10,SageSaga,he played a MMO for years- running from goblins trying to collect rare materials where things were way too tough for him
03-11-2017T02:49:25,SageSaga,masted a bunch of crafting skills- ended up working for a guild
03-11-2017T02:49:45,SageSaga,they would help him get materials and he would just craft and craft-
03-11-2017T02:49:54,SageSaga,and explore
03-11-2017T02:50:06,crimsonreaper,so hes a craft maniac...
03-11-2017T02:50:18,SageSaga,kinda- he likes the idea of building stuff
03-11-2017T02:50:26,Bgrmystr2,I'm tempted to suggest TerraTech
03-11-2017T02:50:48,crimsonreaper,so even if its a game with lots to explore and an extensive crafting system he should like it if its not too hard
03-11-2017T02:50:55,Bgrmystr2,it's more like.. building vehicles with bigass legos to shoot other bigass lego techs and picking up the blocks from them to make yours better
03-11-2017T02:51:13,Bgrmystr2,and you can craft items and use the resources in the world to make stuff too
03-11-2017T02:51:22,Bgrmystr2,it's fun I've played it a bit
03-11-2017T02:51:31,crimsonreaper,let me look at my game list to see if i can find anything he would like
03-11-2017T02:51:48,Bgrmystr2,"""994 hours played"" .. a bit :ptv-confused:"
03-11-2017T02:51:58,SageSaga,Terratech looks interesting
03-11-2017T02:52:20,SageSaga,i dont think its his thing but i'll get him to have a look
03-11-2017T02:52:21,ZRO4825,"well that was fucked up. Some Tablet input panel accesory program called TabTip.exe apparently suddenly exploded and ate like, ALL my RAM and CPU..."
03-11-2017T02:52:30,Bgrmystr2,"I love it to death, they're working on multiplayer atm, but it's suuuuper early so it won't be out for a bit"
03-11-2017T02:52:55,ZRO4825,"And...my RAM is STILL maxed out for some reason...looks like a restart is in order, brb '.'/"
03-11-2017T02:52:59,Bgrmystr2,"It's probably not exactly what he's lookin for, but it has a certain charm to it"
03-11-2017T02:53:57,Mihari,"Hrm, he MIGHT like Subnautica."
03-11-2017T02:54:17,crimsonreaper,subnautica is a scam dont buy it
03-11-2017T02:54:25,Mihari,A scam how?
03-11-2017T02:54:39,SageSaga,i thought about Subnautica- im a little worried though because- same reason as Space Engineers
03-11-2017T02:54:45,crimsonreaper,i got scammed by the bastard on another game dont buy it
03-11-2017T02:55:04,Bgrmystr2,"it doesn't look like a scam to me, crimson"
03-11-2017T02:55:09,Mihari,What about Kerbal?
03-11-2017T02:55:12,SageSaga,3D movement is not his forte
03-11-2017T02:55:19,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Kerbal is a lot of fun
03-11-2017T02:55:35,Bgrmystr2,What about Terraria?
03-11-2017T02:55:37,SageSaga,Kerbal might work for him - i mean he did work at Nasa for a while
03-11-2017T02:56:06,Bgrmystr2,"it's a 2d platformer that starts out like minecraft, and has a whole slew of things on top of that"
03-11-2017T02:56:20,SageSaga,he worked for northrop grumman for 40 years
03-11-2017T02:56:27,Bgrmystr2,that's cool
03-11-2017T02:56:31,SageSaga,i know about Terraria
03-11-2017T02:56:53,SageSaga,i have over 100 hours played - even though i think Steam says a lot more-
03-11-2017T02:56:55,SageSaga,its a liar
03-11-2017T02:57:20,SageSaga,. . . i left it on in the background for days or weeks
03-11-2017T02:57:28,ZRO4825,There we go. That fixed the RAM....seriously a wtf moment there. Apparently CLIP disapproved of me holding shift to draw straight lines a moment. &lt;_&lt;;;
03-11-2017T02:57:31,crimsonreaper,kerbal is nto realistic at all that might bug him lol
03-11-2017T02:57:36,ZRO4825,or something did at least...
03-11-2017T02:57:45,crimsonreaper,not*
03-11-2017T02:57:52,SageSaga,he wasnt launching rockets
03-11-2017T02:57:59,SageSaga,so thats not gonna bother him
03-11-2017T02:58:00,crimsonreaper,lol k
03-11-2017T02:58:02,SageSaga,he was a programmer
03-11-2017T02:58:21,crimsonreaper,but yea other than stranded i cant think of a single thing sry
03-11-2017T02:58:23,SageSaga,past 15 years or more he was Quality assurance- dang good at it too
03-11-2017T02:58:57,crimsonreaper,being good at that job is important :D
03-11-2017T02:58:57,Bgrmystr2,is stranded the one where you start off on that island
03-11-2017T02:59:06,Bgrmystr2,and you make rafts and go to other islands
03-11-2017T02:59:09,crimsonreaper,one of the many with that start yes
03-11-2017T02:59:11,Bgrmystr2,and search downed ships
03-11-2017T02:59:18,crimsonreaper,no
03-11-2017T02:59:21,SageSaga,but the government shut down funding for his last project- so they moved him to a different office building- over an hour longer drive
03-11-2017T02:59:21,Bgrmystr2,no?
03-11-2017T02:59:23,Bgrmystr2,hmm
03-11-2017T02:59:29,crimsonreaper,not that one Bgrm
03-11-2017T02:59:29,Bgrmystr2,what was the game I watched then..
03-11-2017T02:59:35,Bgrmystr2,i don't know what game I'm thinking of
03-11-2017T02:59:37,Bgrmystr2,dunno the title
03-11-2017T02:59:40,MarvTheHugPharaoh,stranded  deep is what you were think about bgr
03-11-2017T02:59:52,Bgrmystr2,ooh
03-11-2017T03:00:16,crimsonreaper,"i had no interest in stranded deep, imbalanced peice of trash i say"
03-11-2017T03:00:21,Bgrmystr2,OH yes
03-11-2017T03:00:22,SageSaga,someone reported to the people about the budget saying the project they were working on could be done on a cell phone- i know what the basics of the program were- yeah it could be done on a cell phone- if you wanted to leak national secrets
03-11-2017T03:00:23,Bgrmystr2,yes that's it
03-11-2017T03:00:27,Bgrmystr2,that's the one I was thinking of
03-11-2017T03:00:53,crimsonreaper,lol
03-11-2017T03:01:16,ZRO4825,"Well....damnit. Just lost that last like, hour of work I did in CLIP because of that RAM issue flipping out...I saved before I closed out CLIP before the restart, but apparently it didn't actually save. &gt;:("
03-11-2017T03:01:20,SageSaga,the whole point of the project was to keep it all secure for military ops
03-11-2017T03:01:38,crimsonreaper,that stinks ZRO
03-11-2017T03:01:45,Bgrmystr2,"look in the temp folders, zro?"
03-11-2017T03:01:51,ZRO4825,?
03-11-2017T03:02:00,crimsonreaper,thats a good point
03-11-2017T03:02:02,Bgrmystr2,"perhaps it's in the temp folder for the program, or even for windows"
03-11-2017T03:02:17,ZRO4825,"Ain't even sure where I'd start to look within them, or which ones to even be looking in~"
03-11-2017T03:02:55,Bgrmystr2,"well, windows has a lot of temp folders and it also highly depends on whether CSP uses the windows one or not"
03-11-2017T03:03:08,Bgrmystr2,or whether it has it's own temp folder for writing files
03-11-2017T03:03:21,Bgrmystr2,would need to look it up
03-11-2017T03:03:22,Bgrmystr2,:c
03-11-2017T03:03:25,crimsonreaper,"yea windows has a ton of temp folders, and some of them are even hidden"
03-11-2017T03:03:37,ZRO4825,"Yeah, that much I knew"
03-11-2017T03:03:44,Bgrmystr2,hidden files not exactly difficult to get to
03-11-2017T03:03:51,Bgrmystr2,"but knowing where it is, that's the hard part xD"
03-11-2017T03:04:01,crimsonreaper,yea but you need to know where they are to find them and reveeal them
03-11-2017T03:04:08,Bgrmystr2,no you don't
03-11-2017T03:04:20,Bgrmystr2,you can make all hidden files visible with folder options
03-11-2017T03:04:25,SageSaga,anyone know about the Wild 8?
03-11-2017T03:04:45,Bgrmystr2,"it's a basic function, super easy to get to, and uh"
03-11-2017T03:04:49,Bgrmystr2,don't know it sage
03-11-2017T03:04:50,Bgrmystr2,:(
03-11-2017T03:05:00,crimsonreaper,"theres basic hidden files and theres windows hiddenf iles basic hidden files are ez, you just make hidden folders visible, for hidden hidden folders you need to know their location"
03-11-2017T03:05:19,SageSaga,"""The Wild Eight"" on steam"
03-11-2017T03:05:26,crimsonreaper,ill look at it
03-11-2017T03:05:37,Bgrmystr2,"well yeah that's what I'm talkin about, you need to know where they are. Hidden isn't really an issue"
03-11-2017T03:05:40,SageSaga,im also considering The Long Dark but it might be too hard for him
03-11-2017T03:06:23,Bgrmystr2,that was a laugh
03-11-2017T03:06:24,crimsonreaper,"well like i said you could start him on stranded 2, free and not that hard"
03-11-2017T03:06:28,Bgrmystr2,I heard the hell out of that
03-11-2017T03:07:16,crimsonreaper,"the controlls on ""the wild eight"" looks like they are bad"
03-11-2017T03:08:03,SageSaga,he asked me about Ark...
03-11-2017T03:08:10,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Ark is alright
03-11-2017T03:08:13,SageSaga,"i was like ""I love Ark... but-"""
03-11-2017T03:08:13,crimsonreaper,oh god NOOOO!!!
03-11-2017T03:08:22,crimsonreaper,its a dino collecting game
03-11-2017T03:08:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"played it for a bit, but it was not for me"
03-11-2017T03:08:32,SageSaga,"i can see it now ""HELP! RAPTORS!"""
03-11-2017T03:08:43,crimsonreaper,Ark is not a survival game nor is it a building game
03-11-2017T03:08:43,Bgrmystr2,"Wild Eight doesn't look like my kind of game, but seems interesting"
03-11-2017T03:08:50,Bgrmystr2,a lot of people complaining about bugs though
03-11-2017T03:09:04,Bgrmystr2,I would consider Ark a survival game
03-11-2017T03:09:09,crimsonreaper,no its not
03-11-2017T03:09:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"the ""HELP RAPTORS"" can go quickly to ""HELP MEGALODON"""
03-11-2017T03:09:23,SageSaga,"""Philip- i just cant handle these raptors!"" ""Phil! I killed a raptor! But then a T-rex looking thing ate me!"" ""Was it a T-rex?"" ""I think?"" ""Thats a Carnosaur"""

03-11-2017T03:10:08,MarvTheHugPharaoh,you had one job phil
03-11-2017T03:10:09,SageSaga,"""WHY IS THERE A DRAGON?!"" =_= ""Daaaad"""
03-11-2017T03:10:09,crimsonreaper,you surviving is not that hard i say now getting your pet dinos to survive is actually much harder
03-11-2017T03:10:37,SageSaga,maybe i should just buy him Civ 6 and wait for a new Survival game XD
03-11-2017T03:10:43,crimsonreaper,and the resource costs for crafting are just stupid i say
03-11-2017T03:11:01,Bgrmystr2,"you do know, reaper, that Ark has survival in the NAME right?"
03-11-2017T03:11:10,Bgrmystr2,and is considered a survival game by steam? xD
03-11-2017T03:11:10,SageSaga,yeah i wouldnt play Ark without 4 players co-op or the resources bumped way up
03-11-2017T03:11:33,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"does your dad like games like theme park, or zoo tycoon, because there is a new Jurassic park game coming out made by the guys who did planet coaster"
03-11-2017T03:11:34,crimsonreaper,yea them putting 80 steel bars for a gun is just dumb
03-11-2017T03:11:47,Bgrmystr2,"even minecraft is a survival game. Isn't difficult, but still applies"
03-11-2017T03:12:02,DarthRexKing,going to bed. night.
03-11-2017T03:12:09,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nighty night Darth
03-11-2017T03:12:10,Bgrmystr2,gnight Rex
03-11-2017T03:12:24,SageSaga,i think if Minecraft didnt look like minecraft my dad would play it forever
03-11-2017T03:12:38,ZRO4825,:thinking:
03-11-2017T03:12:40,Bgrmystr2,There's texture packs all day every day
03-11-2017T03:12:43,SageSaga,"i think he looks at it and says ""THIS GAME IS FOR BABIES"""
03-11-2017T03:12:53,crimsonreaper,so your dads big on grafics?
03-11-2017T03:12:56,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, I got zro to play it"
03-11-2017T03:13:08,Bgrmystr2,and zro was so adamant about not playing it xD
03-11-2017T03:13:16,SageSaga,no hes not huge on graphics- he plays 7 Days- that game looks bleh
03-11-2017T03:13:27,crimsonreaper,heh true
03-11-2017T03:13:32,ZRO4825,I played because Ran.

03-11-2017T03:13:40,SageSaga,but i think he sees it as cartoonish
03-11-2017T03:13:46,crimsonreaper,well that is true
03-11-2017T03:13:59,crimsonreaper,but cartoon does not = kids
03-11-2017T03:14:01,Bgrmystr2,I think if you got a realistic texture pack for minecraft with shaders
03-11-2017T03:14:06,SageSaga,my dad is old
03-11-2017T03:14:12,Bgrmystr2,he might give it a thought
03-11-2017T03:14:26,SageSaga,the shaders wont change anything for him
03-11-2017T03:14:26,Bgrmystr2,there's also many mods that deal with industrial stuff
03-11-2017T03:14:30,SageSaga,i know
03-11-2017T03:14:34,Bgrmystr2,:c
03-11-2017T03:14:36,SageSaga,i love minecraft- ive done em all
03-11-2017T03:14:44,crimsonreaper,yea people that are 40+ do tend to have the idea that cartoons = kids stuff
03-11-2017T03:14:45,Bgrmystr2,there's SO MUCH sage ;~;
03-11-2017T03:15:02,SageSaga,"but my father is very much ""no minecraft! Rabble rabble rabble!"""
03-11-2017T03:15:08,Bgrmystr2,haha
03-11-2017T03:15:10,crimsonreaper,LOL
03-11-2017T03:15:23,SageSaga,i asked him tonight at dinner
03-11-2017T03:15:31,SageSaga,well lunch for me
03-11-2017T03:15:34,SageSaga,dinner for him
03-11-2017T03:16:26,SageSaga,"i was like ""What do you like"" and he was like ""You know what i like"" and i was like ""I reeeeeally dont"""
03-11-2017T03:16:56,crimsonreaper,hehe
03-11-2017T03:17:00,SageSaga,im a little worried about him though tbh
03-11-2017T03:17:06,crimsonreaper,in what way
03-11-2017T03:17:14,ZRO4825,:(
03-11-2017T03:17:20,SageSaga,i dont think hes really ready for Retirement- hes been kinda a workaholic all his life
03-11-2017T03:17:31,SageSaga,hes retiring like 5 years early
03-11-2017T03:17:40,SageSaga,earlier than he planned
03-11-2017T03:17:45,crimsonreaper,"AHHHH i get it, workaholics do tend to have trouble retiring"
03-11-2017T03:17:49,ZRO4825,"Oh god, yeah, those're the worst kind of people to watch try to retire. They just literally don't know what to do with themselves without a solid job. :x"
03-11-2017T03:18:02,SageSaga,so im trying to find something he will enjoy- and he does LIKE playing video games
03-11-2017T03:18:35,SageSaga,and hes not able to work like my grandfather- my grandfather was a carpenter all his life- he still does it but in his little shop
03-11-2017T03:18:57,SageSaga,its now a hobby- my dad doesnt have a hobby- or a group of friends to do stuff with
03-11-2017T03:19:03,crimsonreaper,so a family full of workaholics got it
03-11-2017T03:19:41,SageSaga,so im concerned and i want to help him ease into his retirement with some relaxing games that he will enjoy and play for a while
03-11-2017T03:20:00,SageSaga,because he doesnt get games for a story- play it till its done and move on to the next one
03-11-2017T03:20:17,crimsonreaper,"considering he was a coder, he probably likes puzzles right?"
03-11-2017T03:20:35,SageSaga,he wants a game that he can just sink hours into day to day
03-11-2017T03:21:01,SageSaga,not really- some but - yeah
03-11-2017T03:21:14,SageSaga,he might like the new Myst like games
03-11-2017T03:21:27,SageSaga,like Witness or Obli- Ob- uhhh
03-11-2017T03:21:36,SageSaga,Obduction!
03-11-2017T03:21:46,crimsonreaper,so only  amoderate interest... dang its really hard to find a good game for him
03-11-2017T03:22:03,SageSaga,but i cant afford to buy him a bunch of games either- im going to buy him one definitely but i want it to be a winner
03-11-2017T03:22:14,crimsonreaper,yea i hear you
03-11-2017T03:22:39,crimsonreaper,i mostly play rpgs and such so im not much help in this field :P
03-11-2017T03:22:40,SageSaga,when steam sale hits i can throw 50 dollars at games and try and get a hit or two- but for now i need one sure thing
03-11-2017T03:23:10,SageSaga,im gonna stop the stream now but i'll still be here
03-11-2017T03:23:28,Bgrmystr2,"lol, I would sink hours into Sim City titles"
03-11-2017T03:24:18,crimsonreaper,im still waiting for wolfquest to go on sale...
03-11-2017T03:24:38,SageSaga,i could get him Cities: Skyline
03-11-2017T03:24:43,ZRO4825,Why must boobs be so awesome yet frustrating to draw correctly as a noobie artist-ish person? XD
03-11-2017T03:25:10,crimsonreaper,arent hands harder for you? its what gets most people
03-11-2017T03:25:17,SageSaga,because curves are both fun to draw but need to be perfect or else it looks totally wrong
03-11-2017T03:25:23,ZRO4825,Hands are a bitch.
03-11-2017T03:25:30,ZRO4825,But they lack the awesome that is boobs.
03-11-2017T03:25:34,ZRO4825,"But yes, what Sage said."
03-11-2017T03:25:38,crimsonreaper,hehe
03-11-2017T03:25:43,Bgrmystr2,"Skylines might be interesting. It's not a survival/crafting game, but it's worth a shot"
03-11-2017T03:25:55,SageSaga,also when drawing you naturally want to make curves because of how our joints work
03-11-2017T03:26:19,crimsonreaper,very true
03-11-2017T03:26:33,ZRO4825,And said curves your hand wants to draw may not be the right curves.
03-11-2017T03:26:34,SageSaga,single lines may be good for math and making things easy but the universe is curves
03-11-2017T03:26:55,crimsonreaper,ooo niche is finally full release... check the commnets to see if its really done
03-11-2017T03:27:07,Kamui,nini
03-11-2017T03:27:09,SageSaga,there are more spheres in the universe than there are grains of sand
03-11-2017T03:27:18,SageSaga,on earth
03-11-2017T03:27:19,SageSaga,:P
03-11-2017T03:27:25,crimsonreaper,hehe nice save :D
03-11-2017T03:27:33,SageSaga,i hit enter too soon
03-11-2017T03:27:49,SageSaga,but also many of those grains of sand are spheres too so it may be true
03-11-2017T03:28:18,crimsonreaper,"well ive seen sand under a micro and yea not round, many are jagged"
03-11-2017T03:28:56,crimsonreaper,"which is why sand has that rough feeling, only find sand tends to be round."
03-11-2017T03:28:56,SageSaga,look closer
03-11-2017T03:29:09,SageSaga,we are all made up of spheres
03-11-2017T03:29:23,Mihari,atoms nuf said
03-11-2017T03:29:26,crimsonreaper,yea maybe sphere at the core :P
03-11-2017T03:29:29,SageSaga,quarks!
03-11-2017T03:29:37,crimsonreaper,and those
03-11-2017T03:29:37,SageSaga,which are one of the coolest things ever
03-11-2017T03:30:07,crimsonreaper,i dont pay attention past the atomic level
03-11-2017T03:30:21,SageSaga,omg i was blown away when i found out if you take a quark pair- and seperate them- they both become 2 pairs - still the same size- holy crap- they just generate matter but dont have mass wth
03-11-2017T03:30:41,MarvTheHugPharaoh,@reaper then you might want to stay out of string field theory
03-11-2017T03:31:08,crimsonreaper,had no intention to enter that field Marv :P
03-11-2017T03:32:33,crimsonreaper,"ah people complaining about games because they suck at them how nostalgic, they game doesnt suck you do XD"
03-11-2017T03:33:01,crimsonreaper,reading steam reveiws lol
03-11-2017T03:33:21,SageSaga,thank you everyone for your help - i'll have some videos to show my father and see what he wants XD
03-11-2017T03:33:37,Bgrmystr2,"not always, reaper. Some people suck at games because of bad UI and other unhelpful things"
03-11-2017T03:33:50,MarvTheHugPharaoh,@SageSaga sure thing
03-11-2017T03:33:54,SageSaga,hope to see some of ya in 10 hours and change for the coloring of the comic :D
03-11-2017T03:34:04,Bgrmystr2,"people suck sometimes, truth, but it's always grounded in some way or another"
03-11-2017T03:34:08,crimsonreaper,yea i prolly wont be there
03-11-2017T03:34:09,ZRO4825,I will be at work. Again. Stupid job. &gt;:(
03-11-2017T03:34:18,Bgrmystr2,"I hope it goes well for you and your father, Sage"
03-11-2017T03:34:23,crimsonreaper,but who knows?
03-11-2017T03:34:23,SageSaga,keep working Zro- i need you to keep working
03-11-2017T03:34:27,Bgrmystr2,XD
03-11-2017T03:34:30,crimsonreaper,HAHA
03-11-2017T03:34:38,ZRO4825,He's not lying! XD
03-11-2017T03:34:46,Bgrmystr2,Ikr xD
03-11-2017T03:34:48,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"damn it, now im watching Michio Kaku videos"
03-11-2017T03:34:56,ZRO4825,Though I think I need me to keep working more than Sage needs me to keep working. :thinking:
03-11-2017T03:35:16,ZRO4825,"No job = no payments on car made. Though...without the job, I wouldn't NEED this particular car... Hmmm....."
03-11-2017T03:36:02,SageSaga,i need taxes to be cut on the less wealthy to bolster the economy so people feel more inclined to give their money to me so that i can draw sexy elf girl with sexy catmonster girl
03-11-2017T03:36:02,Bgrmystr2,"but that job pays for more than just that car, doesn't it?"
03-11-2017T03:36:19,Bgrmystr2,haha sage
03-11-2017T03:36:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
03-11-2017T03:36:31,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, it's accurate"
03-11-2017T03:36:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"you can sleep in a car, but you can't race a house Bgr"
03-11-2017T03:36:49,SageSaga,if corporations were the ones sending me money i might feel differently but they arent!
03-11-2017T03:37:23,Bgrmystr2,I dunno marv
03-11-2017T03:37:29,Bgrmystr2,I've seen houses on wheels.
03-11-2017T03:37:37,Bgrmystr2,and not RVs
03-11-2017T03:37:40,Bgrmystr2,I mean real houses
03-11-2017T03:37:43,Bgrmystr2,sitting on trucks.
03-11-2017T03:37:53,SageSaga,im also a firm believer in capitalism stops working when its cheaper to have machines do all the work
03-11-2017T03:38:04,ZRO4825,Tis true.
03-11-2017T03:38:39,SageSaga,I want Star Trek Economy
03-11-2017T03:38:52,crimsonreaper,i havent liked a single star trek game yet
03-11-2017T03:39:00,SageSaga,everyone is taking care of- if you contribute to society you get more benefits
03-11-2017T03:39:26,SageSaga,sounds like communism o_o
03-11-2017T03:41:34,SageSaga,no comment on that? XD
03-11-2017T03:41:36,crimsonreaper,you make it sound like communism is evil
03-11-2017T03:41:56,SageSaga,well in the US it's seen that way still
03-11-2017T03:42:17,ZRO4825,Communism if done RIGHT is not evil.
03-11-2017T03:42:20,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"I got no comment, becasue I was to busy being ""God I want to live on a boat, and get away from the world"""
03-11-2017T03:42:21,crimsonreaper,"which makes no sense, communism in itself is not bad"
03-11-2017T03:42:28,ZRO4825,"Problem is...it's never done right, because humans are selfish creatures."
03-11-2017T03:42:38,crimsonreaper,heh true
03-11-2017T03:42:45,Bgrmystr2,"it works on a small scale, not exactly on a big one"
03-11-2017T03:42:47,ZRO4825,Marv. There's nowhere to race on a boat. At least not with a car.
03-11-2017T03:42:50,Bgrmystr2,nothing is perfect though
03-11-2017T03:42:57,ZRO4825,Unless that's one HELL of a boat...
03-11-2017T03:43:16,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"yeah, but on a boat, its just you a small crew, and the blue"
03-11-2017T03:43:19,ZRO4825,"That, and I play Subnautica. Living on the water all the time isn't all ti's cracked up to be!"
03-11-2017T03:43:33,ZRO4825,Fucking exploding pufferfish thingies...
03-11-2017T03:43:45,SageSaga,all you really need to make it work is a method of providing all requirements for living and working to every living being in the controlled location- how hard can that- oh right
03-11-2017T03:44:26,SageSaga,we have people in our own country starving while we throw away hundreds of tons of perfectly good food every few months
03-11-2017T03:46:04,SageSaga,night guys- dont forget my birthday is coming up and the best present is subscribing to my patreon or sending money :D
03-11-2017T03:46:22,Bgrmystr2,yeah I don't think we've come across the ideal society yet :P
03-11-2017T03:46:25,crimsonreaper,nn sage
03-11-2017T03:46:28,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Nighty night Sage, thanks for the streamy, and speaky speaks"

03-11-2017T03:46:37,Bgrmystr2,thanks for streaming :D
03-11-2017T03:46:43,Bgrmystr2,will try to make it tomorrow
03-11-2017T03:47:09,crimsonreaper,gn every1 im closing the page down :)
03-11-2017T03:47:13,ZRO4825,How could I forget? o.o

03-11-2017T18:02:58,BadFoMo,Cool.
03-11-2017T18:06:04,QuinnAuer,But Kat is still in the tumble dryer then?

03-11-2017T18:12:11,BadFoMo,Same.
03-11-2017T18:24:51,Bgrmystr2,probably because you guys don't get bothered by little details like some of us lol
03-11-2017T18:25:22,MidnightBlue78,:ctwokinds-eyeroll:
03-11-2017T18:25:40,Bgrmystr2,doesn't make it any less true. :P
03-11-2017T18:26:04,Bgrmystr2,and now I can't unsee the kat gif getting bigger every time it loops
03-11-2017T18:31:45,MidnightBlue78,*[sigh]
03-11-2017T18:33:05,MidnightBlue78,Why is my life so boring? :ctwokinds-sadtrace2:
03-11-2017T18:39:39,Bgrmystr2,would you rather have every little thing drive you up the wall? lol
03-11-2017T18:52:25,MidnightBlue78,no....
03-11-2017T18:52:55,MidnightBlue78,😋
03-11-2017T19:04:57,Bgrmystr2,xD
03-11-2017T19:09:01,MidnightBlue78,"i meant, that my life is way too uneventful and nothing exciting ever happens 😕"
03-11-2017T19:14:49,BadFoMo,"So, anyway; for Sunday I requested 'Kathrin and Eric turned into Nagas (like http://twokinds.deviantart.com/art/Snake-Lady-46189197 maybe?) through either a magical accident or Collar (maybe some other type of ‘clothing’?) of Naga Transformation'."
03-11-2017T19:15:05,BadFoMo,What did everyone else request?
03-11-2017T19:31:12,Twokinds,I feel like there's collar overload
03-11-2017T19:33:37,BadFoMo,How about a necklace then?
03-11-2017T19:36:18,BadFoMo,"Actually, now that Ithink about it, a magical accident sound more fun."
03-11-2017T19:51:26,Twokinds,"Yeah, plenty of other magic in the sea"
03-11-2017T20:07:03,Dadrobit,Just submitted my newest #QualitySuggestion!
03-11-2017T21:25:30,unsteddyphoenix,Put all the collars in one vote
03-11-2017T21:25:41,unsteddyphoenix,"""Collar round"""
03-11-2017T21:30:07,Bgrmystr2,biggest problem is that the collar is the most known way to change someone
03-11-2017T21:30:22,Bgrmystr2,"there may be a lot of magic, but most of it is probably not well-known"
03-11-2017T21:32:08,unsteddyphoenix,"Could do something other than just ""change someone""~"
03-11-2017T21:42:46,unsteddyphoenix,Seriously though I like the idea of putting all the collar/transforms in a single vote.
03-11-2017T21:54:45,Bgrmystr2,"What else does the coller do? I mean, it's literally specifically for turning one person into a keidran XD"
03-11-2017T21:56:03,Bgrmystr2,We need something more than just changing what ppl are. More magic in general
03-11-2017T21:56:51,unsteddyphoenix,Thats what I mean
03-11-2017T21:56:54,MidnightBlue78,teleportation
03-11-2017T21:57:16,MidnightBlue78,"Invisiblity, supernatural powers"
03-11-2017T21:57:46,MidnightBlue78,traveling through time
03-11-2017T21:59:36,OwenStarr,Teleportation would be cool.
03-11-2017T22:00:20,MidnightBlue78,hey Owen
03-11-2017T22:00:34,TheRedFoxArt,Hello everyone!
03-11-2017T22:00:57,MidnightBlue78,hello~
03-11-2017T22:01:10,TheRedFoxArt,How are you? ^^
