05-11-2017T00:02:55,Aquaninja101,watch some quality programming to bring that number up
05-11-2017T00:03:24,BluePhantom90,been watching Archer this whole time.... well after the Stream Ended
05-11-2017T00:04:30,Dadrobit,cookie clicker and searching for this damned gif.
05-11-2017T00:04:57,Aquaninja101,kek
05-11-2017T00:05:05,Aquaninja101,you could always try googling it
05-11-2017T00:05:43,Dadrobit,Google and Bing have failed me thus far
05-11-2017T00:06:11,MarvTheHugPharaoh,have you tried screaming at your neighbor?
05-11-2017T00:06:11,Dadrobit,I'm afraid that it was saved on photobucket before they went and screwed everyone over
05-11-2017T00:06:51,BluePhantom90,hmmm sooo
05-11-2017T00:07:19,BluePhantom90,other idea's for Sketch idea's.
05-11-2017T00:08:34,BluePhantom90,Oh! Tom Sketch himself with Flora and Nat threatening him to change their breast sizes.
05-11-2017T00:08:55,MarvTheHugPharaoh,sounds a lot like unboob me human
05-11-2017T00:09:09,BluePhantom90,yes
05-11-2017T00:10:34,BluePhantom90,hmmm what else.
05-11-2017T00:11:58,BluePhantom90,Well Nat getting Doomfist's Gauntlet. would be interesting
05-11-2017T00:11:58,Dadrobit,"Sorry, mate. My list of #QualitySuggestionsDoNotSteal is kept securely on a notepad on my desktop. :D"

05-11-2017T00:15:30,Dadrobit,That's one file name I do not screw around with.
05-11-2017T00:16:00,BadFoMo,//Troll 'NotPorn.txt'.
05-11-2017T00:17:30,BluePhantom90,"Its not porn idea, I said well as in fed and gotten a nice room together."
05-11-2017T00:17:49,Dadrobit,"Hmmm, might go well next to my ""Mountain of Porn"" file."
05-11-2017T00:17:54,FenceEqualizer,"Alright. How about ""AOL"" Who's going to look into that folder"
05-11-2017T00:19:50,Dadrobit,AOL.txt. Seems legit.
05-11-2017T00:20:04,BluePhantom90,isn't that getting shut down?
05-11-2017T00:20:38,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock: That's terrible!

05-11-2017T00:21:09,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I'm more worried about the space jam site going down
05-11-2017T00:21:39,Bgrmystr2,yeah anything hosted by aol would be died.
05-11-2017T00:22:40,FenceEqualizer,They're closing down the space jam site?
05-11-2017T00:23:49,MarvTheHugPharaoh,hope not
05-11-2017T00:24:45,BluePhantom90,kinda excited for this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbBo0USZUz0
05-11-2017T00:24:49,FenceEqualizer,Hope not. Suppose to be talks of a space jam 2
05-11-2017T00:25:03,FenceEqualizer,Everybody get up! It's time to slam now.
05-11-2017T00:25:38,Dadrobit,brb
05-11-2017T00:29:03,Dadrobit,Back
05-11-2017T00:29:10,Dadrobit,And I found one of the versions
05-11-2017T00:29:16,Dadrobit,http://i.imgur.com/Nd3ccbE.gif
05-11-2017T00:29:30,Dadrobit,But the clean version with just a spinning Nat eludes me yet
05-11-2017T00:29:33,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"XD, wat?"
05-11-2017T00:30:03,FenceEqualizer,"wb also what is the story to that Gif, lol."
05-11-2017T00:30:11,BluePhantom90,what?
05-11-2017T00:33:47,Dadrobit,"Tom sketched Natani in a basket of clothes. Then someone else asked, ""Is that how she's washed in her coma?"" And the rest is history."
05-11-2017T00:34:26,Bgrmystr2,hahahahaha
05-11-2017T00:34:29,Bgrmystr2,that's great
05-11-2017T00:34:40,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
05-11-2017T00:35:22,Dadrobit,"Also, Tom, did you do a ""behind the gif"" a couple years back?"

05-11-2017T02:19:00,Dadrobit,Just sent an email your way.
05-11-2017T02:22:35,Dadrobit,Missed him by thaaaaaat~~~ much I think.
05-11-2017T02:23:00,MarvTheHugPharaoh,lol
05-11-2017T02:30:48,Twokinds,Nah I saw your email pop up
05-11-2017T02:32:40,Dadrobit,Coolio
05-11-2017T02:41:55,Dadrobit,But there's a lot in it that I know Tom wouldn't do.
05-11-2017T02:42:02,Dadrobit,whisper fail lol
05-11-2017T02:49:28,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-flomad: IS THAT A CHALLENGE?
05-11-2017T02:49:54,Dadrobit,"LOL,"
05-11-2017T02:50:00,Dadrobit,I'd win this one.
05-11-2017T02:50:41,FenceEqualizer,Got me curious.
05-11-2017T02:50:44,Dadrobit,Mostly concerning the manufacturing of hard lore.
05-11-2017T02:51:00,unsteddyphoenix,http://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/cheese_it_futurama.gif
05-11-2017T02:51:30,MarvTheHugPharaoh,you know its been a good day when you see a bender gif
05-11-2017T02:51:37,Dadrobit,And some bow chicka wow wow that was in the original version of a fanfic I was making. Mostly sure you wouldn't do that. :D

05-11-2017T02:55:33,Dadrobit,:ptv-uneasy:
05-11-2017T02:57:42,Twokinds,I do like the idea
05-11-2017T02:57:50,Twokinds,But it does break some of the lore about Basitins
05-11-2017T02:58:10,Dadrobit,Hm?
05-11-2017T03:00:08,unsteddyphoenix,Is it fixable?
05-11-2017T03:00:11,Dadrobit,"Do you wanna chat here, or email, or is it unworkable?"
05-11-2017T03:05:09,Twokinds,Hm...
05-11-2017T03:05:34,Twokinds,It is 3am so I'm le tired
05-11-2017T03:06:06,Twokinds,"Some of it is minor issues, others are larger"
05-11-2017T03:07:54,Twokinds,And there's some... pretty dramatic departures from the story
05-11-2017T03:08:03,Dadrobit,"Well, whenever you're up for it, shoot me the issues and I'll see if I can't fix and or loophole 'em up. 1am here and I have class at the crack of noon tomorrow, so I should probably be getting my sick butt to bed as well."
05-11-2017T03:08:08,Dadrobit,Lol
05-11-2017T03:08:24,Twokinds,ok
05-11-2017T03:08:32,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nighty night you guys

05-11-2017T03:08:38,unsteddyphoenix,alternate universe~
05-11-2017T03:08:48,Dadrobit,Glad you at least like the idea Tom. :D
05-11-2017T03:08:54,unsteddyphoenix,Gnight
05-11-2017T03:08:57,FenceEqualizer,Night all you night owls
05-11-2017T03:09:26,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"its only 12 here, so I reckon I'll stay up and read more on dinosaurs"
05-11-2017T03:09:38,Dadrobit,#Priorities
05-11-2017T03:09:53,unsteddyphoenix,Tell me a dinosaur fact
05-11-2017T03:09:54,MarvTheHugPharaoh,its a nostalgia fix for me
05-11-2017T03:10:23,FenceEqualizer,Dinosaurs are very big.
05-11-2017T03:10:36,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"the raptor is Jurassic park were molded off the utahraptor,"
05-11-2017T03:11:14,MarvTheHugPharaoh,which stood around 6ft tall and about 14ft long
05-11-2017T03:11:51,unsteddyphoenix,That fact was pretty fun! subscribed
05-11-2017T03:12:18,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"The T-Rex was also not in the Jurassic period, it was in the Ceratosaurus"
05-11-2017T03:12:41,unsteddyphoenix,that one i did know
05-11-2017T03:14:04,Twokinds,Dinosaurs are very rare these days.
05-11-2017T03:14:32,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"yep, almost like they are not around any more"
05-11-2017T03:14:41,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:(
05-11-2017T03:15:09,Twokinds,They'll be back. And in greater numbers.
05-11-2017T03:15:21,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:)
05-11-2017T03:15:28,unsteddyphoenix,They kind of turned into an underground movement
05-11-2017T03:15:48,unsteddyphoenix,Though I hear there's one in the new Mario game.
05-11-2017T03:16:18,MarvTheHugPharaoh,looks like I'm gonna have to buy a switch and the new mario now
05-11-2017T03:17:46,unsteddyphoenix,No dragons though. When are THOSE coming back?
05-11-2017T03:17:52,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"yep, gonna happen just saw a video with a T-rex wearing marios hat"
05-11-2017T03:19:52,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"also another dino fact, In JP 3 we don't actually see a Spinosaurus.  What we see is a Baryonyx with that sail of a Spinosaurus"
05-11-2017T03:20:27,FenceEqualizer,Don't think the world could handle dragons.
05-11-2017T03:21:05,FenceEqualizer,"Also wait, I know it's a movie. I know it's not fact but JP couldn't get there awesome Dinosaurs right?"
05-11-2017T03:21:21,Twokinds,Dragons are very friendly.
05-11-2017T03:21:36,MidnightBlue78,:ctwokinds-NoraEyebrows:
05-11-2017T03:21:56,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:ctwokinds-renirawr: yeah...... friendly
05-11-2017T03:21:58,unsteddyphoenix,We could handle it. Crazier things have happened this year.
05-11-2017T03:22:38,unsteddyphoenix,Risk of gender-jumping is a small price to pay~
05-11-2017T03:23:00,FenceEqualizer,Depends on the dragons. Super intellegent dragons could lead to a good few years of issues.
05-11-2017T03:23:42,MarvTheHugPharaoh,just make sure they can't grant wishes.  Don't want the wrong people getting what they want
05-11-2017T03:24:01,unsteddyphoenix,But...IM the wrong people! D:
05-11-2017T03:24:06,MarvTheHugPharaoh,so am I
05-11-2017T03:25:34,Twokinds,Humans in Twokinds are generally not afraid of dragons.
05-11-2017T03:25:41,Twokinds,Keidran less so.
05-11-2017T03:25:52,unsteddyphoenix,And basitin not at all?
05-11-2017T03:26:07,FenceEqualizer,Keidran knows what's up.
05-11-2017T03:26:24,unsteddyphoenix,Why are keidran not afraid? They probably wouldnt interact with very many like humans would.
05-11-2017T03:26:36,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"""oh Look, a flying dinosaur that breath fire and can turn me into a women at any time.  Im gonna go say hi"""
05-11-2017T03:27:18,MidnightBlue78,i'm gonna poke it with this stick  and see what happens xD
05-11-2017T03:27:29,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
05-11-2017T03:27:35,unsteddyphoenix,"""Flying dinosaur"" is offensive slang and you should apologise"
05-11-2017T03:27:54,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-renirawr:
05-11-2017T03:28:10,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"whats more offensive , Dinosaur or lizard?"
05-11-2017T03:28:22,unsteddyphoenix,Now we're asking the real questions
05-11-2017T03:28:27,FenceEqualizer,Probably Lizard.
05-11-2017T03:28:42,MidnightBlue78,definitely lizard
05-11-2017T03:28:44,Twokinds,"Sometimes, a village might just find a dragon sleeping on a hill nearby."
05-11-2017T03:28:52,unsteddyphoenix,Also I think only Nora has gender-bending-tier magic
05-11-2017T03:29:02,unsteddyphoenix,That sounds really cute~
05-11-2017T03:29:08,MidnightBlue78,mushu disnt like being called a lizard
05-11-2017T03:30:09,Twokinds,Heheh
05-11-2017T03:30:13,MidnightBlue78,and then what would they do?
05-11-2017T03:30:26,FenceEqualizer,"""Omg is that a dragon by the fields? Let's poke it with a stick."" - Joe the Keidran."
05-11-2017T03:30:38,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"pete and the dragon, came to my mind from the Tom"
05-11-2017T03:31:03,MarvTheHugPharaoh,or Pete's dragon
05-11-2017T03:31:30,unsteddyphoenix,I enjoy the idea that every humanoid race might find each other scarier than dragons.
05-11-2017T03:32:04,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"have you seen a human, those things are crazy"
05-11-2017T03:32:09,Twokinds,Heheh
05-11-2017T03:33:21,unsteddyphoenix,I heard they dont have tails AT ALL :ctwokinds-reniderp_flip:
05-11-2017T03:33:37,MidnightBlue78,some do tho
05-11-2017T03:33:37,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:ctwokinds-reniderp: NO WAY !?
05-11-2017T03:33:59,FenceEqualizer,Does a tail bone count?
05-11-2017T03:34:10,unsteddyphoenix,On every level except physical I have a tail
05-11-2017T03:34:16,unsteddyphoenix,Prooobably not
05-11-2017T03:37:35,unsteddyphoenix,I wonder if war broke out would there be dragons who would fight for the humans?
05-11-2017T03:37:49,unsteddyphoenix,Assuming they were paid/in love with guard captains enough
05-11-2017T03:38:04,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:ctwokinds-reniembarrassed:
05-11-2017T03:38:57,Twokinds,lol
05-11-2017T03:39:07,Twokinds,Maybe.
05-11-2017T03:40:36,unsteddyphoenix,Hmm~
05-11-2017T03:40:45,Twokinds,Would be pretty bad for Keidran. But odds are Dragons would not fight a total war.
05-11-2017T03:41:07,Twokinds,"Reni is a loyal member of humanity, but she's almost the only one."
05-11-2017T03:41:37,unsteddyphoenix,"Ahh, I see."
05-11-2017T03:41:58,unsteddyphoenix,"It's not like they'd come together and make a desicion as a race though, right?"
05-11-2017T03:42:04,unsteddyphoenix,Considering how individualistic they seem
05-11-2017T03:42:14,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"The rest are mostly ""you do what ever as long as it doesn't me"" type?"
05-11-2017T03:43:40,Twokinds,"No, certainly not."
05-11-2017T03:44:06,Twokinds,Dragons have no concept of natonality or government.
05-11-2017T03:44:41,unsteddyphoenix,"I really like that, it make so much sense."
05-11-2017T03:45:00,unsteddyphoenix,What's the point of banding together when you're already so powerful.
05-11-2017T03:45:56,Twokinds,Exactly. They're each entirely self sufficient.
05-11-2017T03:46:52,unsteddyphoenix,"Oh btw, wanted to ask, what was human-keidran relations like 5-10 years before Trace took over? Was it still fairly strained?"
05-11-2017T03:46:55,FenceEqualizer,Though makes me wonder if there's dragons out there that just destroy things for Sh** and giggles.
05-11-2017T03:47:23,Twokinds,It was headed downhill before Trace.
05-11-2017T03:47:38,Twokinds,Things were a lot better the previous generation.
05-11-2017T03:48:28,unsteddyphoenix,What was causing it? Were the templar becoming corrupted before Trace took over?
05-11-2017T03:48:38,unsteddyphoenix,Or was it...just a bunch of small things adding up
05-11-2017T03:49:51,unsteddyphoenix,By the way yes I AM asking lore questions late at night because im a jerk
05-11-2017T03:49:59,Twokinds,There was an upswelling of nationalism among younger generations of wolves following a period of peace that lead to increased conflicts along the boards.
05-11-2017T03:50:55,unsteddyphoenix,"Damn, damn that's interesting. There's so much potential there."
05-11-2017T03:52:23,unsteddyphoenix,"Since the humans lands are in the middle of the continent, do some keidran trade with each other by sea?"
05-11-2017T03:52:24,Bgrmystr2,was there slavery during the peace? Or was that something post-trace?
05-11-2017T03:52:36,Bgrmystr2,"well, post-trace coming to power"
05-11-2017T03:53:06,Bgrmystr2,"also, interesting to know that there was problems brewing before trace was even a thing :thinking:"
05-11-2017T03:54:06,Twokinds,There just isn't much trade between the west and east sides.
05-11-2017T03:55:21,unsteddyphoenix,We dont really know much about keidrans technology levels
05-11-2017T03:55:46,unsteddyphoenix,Like whether they can even build ships :thinking:
05-11-2017T03:56:05,Bgrmystr2,I presume they would be able to
05-11-2017T03:56:07,Twokinds,"At the time Twokinds takes place, technology is just reaching the point where cross-sea shipping is possible."
05-11-2017T03:56:28,Bgrmystr2,"wow, even with all the magic"
05-11-2017T03:56:34,Bgrmystr2,and the towers and stuff
05-11-2017T03:57:29,Bgrmystr2,"Well, I guess since Eric's boat shape-shifts, obviously magic is related :V"
05-11-2017T03:57:38,Bgrmystr2,or.. did shapeshift.
05-11-2017T03:57:42,Bgrmystr2,before you murdered it.
05-11-2017T03:57:49,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-unimpressed:
05-11-2017T03:58:00,Twokinds,Hey that wasn't me. That was the wolves.
05-11-2017T03:58:08,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-laugh:
05-11-2017T03:58:39,Bgrmystr2,fair
05-11-2017T03:58:40,Bgrmystr2,I guess.
05-11-2017T03:59:12,Bgrmystr2,but you wrote it! :ptv-sad:
05-11-2017T03:59:14,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Wolves did nothing wrong
05-11-2017T03:59:17,unsteddyphoenix,Well all the towers and stuff were all human stuff
05-11-2017T03:59:31,unsteddyphoenix,Which kind of made me think there was a tech gap
05-11-2017T03:59:40,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: yeah that is true
05-11-2017T04:00:16,Bgrmystr2,I would have expected a lesser tech gap if the the races saw each other as equals during the peace
05-11-2017T04:01:01,Bgrmystr2,"but since it's only just now becoming possible to create ships, it's more likely that it was just never a thing"
05-11-2017T04:02:24,Bgrmystr2,I'm gonna ignore marv.
05-11-2017T04:02:28,Bgrmystr2,just gonna sit here.
05-11-2017T04:02:30,Bgrmystr2,and ignore.
05-11-2017T04:02:40,unsteddyphoenix,Except those WHITE wolves
05-11-2017T04:02:42,unsteddyphoenix,Ugh
05-11-2017T04:02:47,Bgrmystr2,ikr
05-11-2017T04:02:49,MarvTheHugPharaoh,you can't hide from the truth for long bgr
05-11-2017T04:02:53,Bgrmystr2,beyond that one
05-11-2017T04:03:01,Bgrmystr2,that one white wolf
05-11-2017T04:03:06,Bgrmystr2,she was nice
05-11-2017T04:03:10,Bgrmystr2,kinda sassy though
05-11-2017T04:03:14,MarvTheHugPharaoh,natani?
05-11-2017T04:03:15,Bgrmystr2,but nice nonetheless.
05-11-2017T04:03:18,Bgrmystr2,WHITE wolf?
05-11-2017T04:03:27,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Flora?

05-11-2017T04:03:41,Bgrmystr2,is obviously nora
05-11-2017T04:03:50,Bgrmystr2,"yeah we don't sleep, DJ"
05-11-2017T04:03:50,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"oh yeah, Nora"
05-11-2017T04:04:21,FenceEqualizer,But...Nora is silver....:ptv-confused:
05-11-2017T04:04:29,FenceEqualizer,And not a wolf. :ptv-sad:

05-11-2017T11:56:33,MidnightBlue78,:ctwokinds-katwet:
05-11-2017T12:49:34,Twokinds,Morning
05-11-2017T12:50:04,iliar,Morning
05-11-2017T12:51:49,BadFoMo,//Troll Shut up! It's almost 1:00 PM! People are trying to sleep!
05-11-2017T12:56:04,MidnightBlue78,good morning!
05-11-2017T12:56:43,MidnightBlue78,*[I HATE MONDAYS]
05-11-2017T12:58:43,MidnightBlue78,:ctwokinds-FloDance:
05-11-2017T13:07:36,Twokinds,What's wrong with Mondays?
05-11-2017T13:07:39,Twokinds,They're my day off.
05-11-2017T13:07:59,iliar,@BadFoMo Well... In world many time zones. In some time zones right now is morning.
05-11-2017T13:14:24,MidnightBlue78,they suck
05-11-2017T13:14:44,MidnightBlue78,plus i never get a day off :ctwokinds-nataniAAAAshake:
05-11-2017T13:17:48,MidnightBlue78,"do you even have any real days off, Tom? I bet you're drawing something right now..."
05-11-2017T13:28:17,MidnightBlue78,:ctwokinds-katdryer:
05-11-2017T13:36:40,Dadrobit,"Blargle argh. Still feel like crap, gotta head into class in a bit though..."
05-11-2017T14:03:59,Twokinds,...
05-11-2017T14:04:13,Twokinds,"Yes, I am. I'm sketching comic pages."
05-11-2017T14:04:19,Twokinds,But that doesn't prove anything!
05-11-2017T14:08:50,QuinnAuer,"I can't decide if it counts as a day off then if you're doing what is kind of your job, but you like doing it."
05-11-2017T14:09:04,QuinnAuer,"At least I hope you like doing it, otherwise we're all a bunch of slave drivers."
05-11-2017T14:10:10,iliar,New page? You already have a few fully drawn pages. I thought you'd take a days off. And you will publish already drawn pages.
05-11-2017T14:12:37,Twokinds,Well I'm not entirely satisfied with the current pages right now.
05-11-2017T14:17:30,Twokinds,"And you know, gotta make future pages too"
05-11-2017T14:30:10,MidnightBlue78,"It's ok Tom, we actually really like it when you work :ctwokinds-rainehappy:"
05-11-2017T14:35:57,iliar,Yeah. Future pages is needed. MORE PAGES!!!
05-11-2017T14:36:03,iliar,But it seems to me you worked hard in last month. So I think... never mind...
05-11-2017T18:10:51,BrunoYcaro,"Tom i did sketch flora in a military theme during your stream,can i post it in my twitter once it's ready?"
05-11-2017T18:11:06,BrunoYcaro,like when i finish it
05-11-2017T18:30:18,MidnightBlue78,:ctwokinds-natsducky:
05-11-2017T18:31:11,Twokinds,Sure
05-11-2017T18:31:48,unsteddyphoenix,Hey! What's wrong with the current pages!
05-11-2017T18:32:03,unsteddyphoenix,I wont have you dissin' one of my favourite webcomics! :ctwokinds-flomad:
05-11-2017T18:32:29,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-floAAA: I'll diss it all I want!
05-11-2017T18:34:23,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-nataniAAAAshake: ITS A LOT OF WORK TO MAKE A WEBCOMIC YOU SHOULD APPRECIATE THAT DEDICATION THAT GOES INTO IT
05-11-2017T18:35:25,unsteddyphoenix,Is there anything...you think you could be doing in particular? Or are you just always lookin' for general improvement :thinking:
05-11-2017T18:36:51,Twokinds,Eh I dunno
05-11-2017T18:37:13,Twokinds,"I'm working on dialogue, which is a process that tends to make me the most time"
05-11-2017T18:39:40,unsteddyphoenix,I have noticed~
05-11-2017T18:42:32,unsteddyphoenix,Sometimes there's a lot of information that needs to be conveyed but you dont wanna fill up the page with text
05-11-2017T18:42:39,unsteddyphoenix,I can see how tricky it must be
05-11-2017T18:44:49,Bgrmystr2,haha that exchange though xD
05-11-2017T18:44:58,Bgrmystr2,that's what I stay here for.
05-11-2017T19:05:47,Twokinds,Yeah there's a struggle between trying to convey information and just dumping exposition.
05-11-2017T19:06:32,Twokinds,"And also, there's writing characters doing stuff, and then there's trying to explain why and how characters are doing stuff."
05-11-2017T19:06:49,Twokinds,Which is easy to not get right.
05-11-2017T19:11:21,BrunoYcaro,^
05-11-2017T19:20:16,TheRedFoxArt,"Oh, hello everyone, hi Tom ^^/"
05-11-2017T19:22:55,unsteddyphoenix,"Not to mention trying to figure out what info people will grasp through the artworks and context, and what  needs to be specifically explained."
05-11-2017T19:23:09,unsteddyphoenix,"Thats the part that would mess me up the most, I think"
05-11-2017T19:24:07,unsteddyphoenix,"Will people notice that a character has done/not done a thing, or does it need to be pointed out..."
05-11-2017T19:25:04,TheRedFoxArt,I agree with that..
05-11-2017T19:34:28,TheRedFoxArt,"Well.. it depends the type of people who read and see the things, and how the people read and see, i think ^^"
05-11-2017T19:44:48,TheRedFoxArt,"Uh, heeello? o.O"
05-11-2017T19:52:30,TheRedFoxArt,I will  come back lateeeer O.o
05-11-2017T19:53:45,TheRedFoxArt,has just disappeared
05-11-2017T21:34:01,Bgrmystr2,"No matter how many times I look at that Halloween image of Flora on the page right now, I just can't help but notice how soft she actually looks."
05-11-2017T21:34:19,Bgrmystr2,Seems like you could just reach into the monitor and poke her
05-11-2017T21:34:48,Bgrmystr2,not often I see colors so well done :u
05-11-2017T21:51:40,Twokinds,:D
05-11-2017T21:53:04,Twokinds,Warm colors have a way of making things look soft and fluffy
05-11-2017T22:13:18,TheRedFoxArt,What stories inspired you to create your comic? I'm curious about that ^^
05-11-2017T22:38:15,BluePhantom90,Hello all
05-11-2017T22:39:27,BluePhantom90,hmm?
05-11-2017T22:41:23,TheRedFoxArt,Hello!
05-11-2017T22:42:37,BluePhantom90,hey
05-11-2017T22:42:49,TheRedFoxArt,How are you buddy? ^^
05-11-2017T22:43:43,BluePhantom90,"oh alright. Just one thing kinda bugging me now, What dose Tom use for Magic symbols its Runic but which kind"
05-11-2017T22:46:41,BluePhantom90,Or if he could give us a Magic Runes for us to play around with.
05-11-2017T22:47:44,TheRedFoxArt,"I dont know about magic runes so well ^^"""
05-11-2017T22:48:56,BluePhantom90,Oh its vary interesting. Tom's runes look slightly Long-Branch with a mix of Elvish in it
05-11-2017T22:50:19,TheRedFoxArt,Elvish huh?
05-11-2017T22:51:47,TheRedFoxArt,Like...The lord of the rings?
05-11-2017T22:51:50,BluePhantom90,Elvish has a fancy look to it. But Toms magic Runes have more Artistic look to it
05-11-2017T22:51:56,BluePhantom90,in a way yes
05-11-2017T22:54:34,TheRedFoxArt,Mmh... I prefer the Artistic look of Tom a bit more
05-11-2017T22:56:02,BluePhantom90,Yeah the Runes Tom makes are interesting. So I wanted to check see what his magic Rune style is biased on
05-11-2017T22:57:24,TheRedFoxArt,"Ooh, i understand"
05-11-2017T22:57:54,TheRedFoxArt,And you found Elvish
05-11-2017T22:59:04,BluePhantom90,Elvish is good. But I was fascinated by runes
05-11-2017T23:00:11,TheRedFoxArt,I agree ^^
05-11-2017T23:20:23,BluePhantom90,"Soy de Ohio, es muy barato aquí. Pero creo que California es una causa perdida."
