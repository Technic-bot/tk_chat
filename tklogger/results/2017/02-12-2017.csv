02-12-2017T16:58:48,MidnightBlue78,adjustable firmness and shit
02-12-2017T16:58:49,CrRAR,tru dover lol
02-12-2017T16:59:00,Ordithus,It would be neat if they had different presets in the software.
02-12-2017T16:59:25,ThingsAreMoving,so those pens are like steaks?
02-12-2017T16:59:27,Ordithus,Like having multiple real pens
02-12-2017T16:59:51,Twokinds,Technically the pens are just backups in case one breaks. But I found they could be programmed differently
02-12-2017T16:59:53,Ordithus,Though I suppose you can just hotkey it...
02-12-2017T16:59:54,Twokinds,So I take advantage of that
02-12-2017T17:00:01,Serpentfrog,"I'll have my pen medium rare, Things."
02-12-2017T17:00:02,Ordithus,Cool.
02-12-2017T17:00:03,CrRAR,nice
02-12-2017T17:00:06,ThingsAreMoving,Mmmmmyesss.. I need the pen with medium rare firmness
02-12-2017T17:00:08,Twokinds,Could just change the settings but it's easier just to switch pens
02-12-2017T17:00:09,funnyman42,Very nice.
02-12-2017T17:00:17,CrRAR,yeah
02-12-2017T17:00:21,ChromeDragon24,nice
02-12-2017T17:00:37,CrRAR,I would put little colored dots on em for identification.
02-12-2017T17:00:44,Ordithus,Racing stripes!

02-12-2017T17:00:50,CrRAR,lol
02-12-2017T17:01:14,Serpentfrog,Fun fact: stripes make you move faster.
02-12-2017T17:01:17,CrRAR,Name them appropriately different 2K characters
02-12-2017T17:01:19,MidnightBlue78,i think its a pretty cool feature
02-12-2017T17:01:25,CrRAR,The firmest... Is musclehead
02-12-2017T17:01:29,MidnightBlue78,that they can be adjusted
02-12-2017T17:01:32,CrRAR,yah
02-12-2017T17:01:38,Ordithus,Stripes add 5 horsepower.  Which is a lot for a pen.
02-12-2017T17:01:42,Twokinds,"The pens have different grip textures, so I can tell which one they are by feel."
02-12-2017T17:01:51,funnyman42,Also nice

02-12-2017T17:22:24,PalmettoPathfinder1,These remind me of the Blue Ridge Mountains here in the South.
02-12-2017T17:22:56,ChromeDragon24,this just keeps getting better
02-12-2017T17:22:59,Lukewci25,"Thanks, but that is not that. What I mean is normal curriculum of studies, but only durring weekends"

02-12-2017T17:28:41,Lukewci25,What is a difference between military school and normal school in USA? Because here the major differences are uniforms and more nationalist pupils from what I know.
02-12-2017T17:28:42,CrRAR,It's funny you should mention considering the two Navy ships that crashed randomly
02-12-2017T17:28:42,Combak,... How can there be too much bureaucracy and no organization? Those are opposites!

02-12-2017T20:21:54,HeresyArtStream,That Kat pic turned out great!
02-12-2017T20:21:56,Creosha,"Or do something super lewd, like hold his hand and be happy with him."
02-12-2017T20:21:56,unsteddyphoenix,Or he isnt oblivious but just sisterzoned her
02-12-2017T20:21:58,HeresyArtStream,So cute! &lt;3

02-12-2017T23:29:34,Twokinds,I couldn't
02-12-2017T23:29:47,Twokinds,The settings were saved but I couldn't open the program without deleting everything

02-12-2017T23:30:48,Combak,"Okay, but this time. Does it make some file or something that contains the settings? Couldn't you copy that file somewhere, save it, and copy it back in case this happens again?"
02-12-2017T23:30:54,Twokinds,I never backed them up seomwhere else because I never considered that a program would just refuse to open.
02-12-2017T23:30:59,Bgrmystr2,"what do you mean, palm. The recordings naturally open in it's own window"

02-12-2017T23:31:38,unsteddyphoenix,Tragic
02-12-2017T23:31:50,Combak,"I understand that. I'm asking if a back-up of this is possible, and if so, recommending you do one."
02-12-2017T23:31:53,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Well, I mean yeah if you want to watch different recordings you can't do that."
02-12-2017T23:31:55,Bgrmystr2,"I'm sure there was probably something that could have fixed it without losing settings, but I couldn't be sure what"
02-12-2017T23:31:57,CrRAR,Yeah way to technically presumptuous to expect.
