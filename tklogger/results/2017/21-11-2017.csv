21-11-2017T14:36:30,PalmettoPathfinder1,Of course I don't think he'll do both a sketch and comic together.

21-11-2017T16:42:18,MidnightBlue78,:ctwokinds-kingtea:
21-11-2017T16:42:19,Mitternachtfox,No sometimes its the ceiling
21-11-2017T16:42:31,Bgrmystr2,that's only if you're inside
21-11-2017T16:42:41,Bgrmystr2,then it's the ceiling
21-11-2017T16:42:50,Mitternachtfox,Yea but its not always the sky
21-11-2017T16:42:57,Bgrmystr2,sometimes ceiling fan.
21-11-2017T16:43:20,Bgrmystr2,and sky is above the ceiling
21-11-2017T16:43:28,Bgrmystr2,so it's still up
21-11-2017T16:43:38,Bgrmystr2,"doesn't specify what you see, just what is above."
21-11-2017T16:45:06,MidnightBlue78,"ok, jeez"
21-11-2017T16:45:17,MidnightBlue78,"the sky, the ceiling"
21-11-2017T16:45:32,MidnightBlue78,Both correct answers xD
21-11-2017T16:45:46,Bgrmystr2,you can't use the ceiling if you're outside though :V
21-11-2017T16:45:54,Bgrmystr2,cuz then it is false
21-11-2017T16:46:00,Mitternachtfox,Lol
21-11-2017T16:46:06,Bgrmystr2,these are important rules
21-11-2017T16:46:16,MidnightBlue78,and what if you'renin the Upside Down???? :ctwokinds-floraquestion:
21-11-2017T16:46:34,MidnightBlue78,like in the tv show
21-11-2017T16:46:49,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno what ""nin the upside down"" means, but y'know what, I'll allow it"
21-11-2017T16:46:52,qwe304,what if you are above the sky?
21-11-2017T16:46:55,Mitternachtfox,Idk that
21-11-2017T16:47:04,Bgrmystr2,"then the sky is down, and space is up"
21-11-2017T16:47:10,Bgrmystr2,obviously
21-11-2017T16:47:15,MidnightBlue78,"*""You're in the Upside down"""

21-11-2017T16:47:33,MarvTheHugPharaoh,sweet
21-11-2017T16:47:49,Bgrmystr2,is 'the upside down' an object of some type you can get inside of? xD
21-11-2017T16:48:26,MidnightBlue78,it's like a parallel world but it's all dark and shit
21-11-2017T16:48:51,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: and they call it the upside down?
21-11-2017T16:48:56,MidnightBlue78,yeah

21-11-2017T16:52:17,Mitternachtfox,Oh
21-11-2017T16:55:15,Bgrmystr2,I don't watch horror or anything of the like
21-11-2017T16:56:09,MarvTheHugPharaoh,its not really horror but more like a mystery
21-11-2017T16:56:15,MidnightBlue78,right
21-11-2017T16:56:43,Bgrmystr2,that's what they said about a lot of shows.
21-11-2017T16:56:51,Bgrmystr2,"It's not horror, it's this"
21-11-2017T16:56:57,Bgrmystr2,fuckin turns out to be horror
21-11-2017T16:56:59,Bgrmystr2,&gt;.&gt;

21-11-2017T17:01:52,MidnightBlue78,"Now star trek, you wouldnt catch me dead watching it"
21-11-2017T17:02:33,qwe304,is wearing a star trek shirt right now
21-11-2017T17:02:44,Bgrmystr2,"well, it is sci-fi"
21-11-2017T17:02:55,Bgrmystr2,so it caters to certain people
21-11-2017T17:02:57,Bgrmystr2,and that's ok
21-11-2017T17:03:15,MidnightBlue78,stranger things too
21-11-2017T17:03:21,qwe304,I havent found a comedy show I like

21-11-2017T17:03:40,MidnightBlue78,"i mean, i have nothing against it, i've just never been interested in it"
21-11-2017T17:03:52,Bgrmystr2,"still being aired, don't know qwe"
21-11-2017T17:04:01,Bgrmystr2,lots of ones in the past were good
21-11-2017T17:04:33,qwe304,ive watched a lot of comedies from the 60s and 70s
21-11-2017T17:04:59,MidnightBlue78,I loved the jeffersons
21-11-2017T17:05:05,Combak,Apparently The Orville is a good spiritual successor to some parts of Star Trek.
21-11-2017T17:05:11,MidnightBlue78,I used to watch it witb my grandma
21-11-2017T17:05:19,MidnightBlue78,*with
21-11-2017T17:05:38,Combak,"Note: Never seen it, just heard a bit about an episode."
21-11-2017T17:06:05,qwe304,ive seen a bit
21-11-2017T17:06:31,qwe304,to me it just felt like a dumbed down star trek
21-11-2017T17:07:23,TorqueEmUp,Late reply @qwe304 But Horizon Zero Dawn.
21-11-2017T17:08:07,qwe304,Thats ps4 exclusive

21-11-2017T17:08:41,TorqueEmUp,"playing in on a PS4 Pro, game looks friggin' beautiful"
21-11-2017T17:08:59,qwe304,my computer could easily run it though
21-11-2017T17:09:09,TorqueEmUp,"Got Platinum in the main game, going through the DLC Frozen Wilds right now."
21-11-2017T17:09:30,TorqueEmUp,Well ain't that a shame
21-11-2017T17:09:34,TorqueEmUp,:P
21-11-2017T17:09:53,qwe304,"though its kinda ironic that i built my own computer but then play 7y/o games on it, even though i have newer games"

21-11-2017T17:12:03,TorqueEmUp,"Damn good game, I slightly like Fallout 3 more."
21-11-2017T17:12:34,TorqueEmUp,can't say I was a big fan of deserts
21-11-2017T17:13:18,TorqueEmUp,"New Vegas felt like it had a lot of open empty space, and the scale of the whole area felt really off."
21-11-2017T17:13:38,qwe304,to me fallout 3 felt short
21-11-2017T17:14:01,qwe304,i finished it in a day
21-11-2017T17:14:02,TorqueEmUp,"Like the dessert was big, but they made the city of vegas extremely tiny."
21-11-2017T17:14:17,qwe304,but ive got 50 or so hours in nv
21-11-2017T17:15:46,qwe304,yeah the games more fun if you increase your move speed
21-11-2017T17:16:14,TorqueEmUp,"That and the whole american western theme kinda put me off a bit, never was a fan of the old west, or cowboys or that kinda thing."
21-11-2017T17:17:53,qwe304,who did you side witjh?
21-11-2017T17:18:26,TorqueEmUp,First time I Beat the game I sided with the NCR.
21-11-2017T17:21:32,qwe304,"Ive played throug twice, once with house and once with yes man"

21-11-2017T17:23:50,TorqueEmUp,"I'm a goody  goody, I always do the good guy side. It's just how I am. :P"
21-11-2017T17:24:25,TorqueEmUp,"I did too Sammit, got 100% of the achievements including DLC out of the 360 version."
21-11-2017T17:24:42,qwe304,"well, honestly i belive the mohave was better off without the legion and ncr"
21-11-2017T17:24:47,TorqueEmUp,picked up the GOTY edition right before Fallout 4 came out and plowed through it.
21-11-2017T17:25:31,TorqueEmUp,The only thing really negative the NCR employed was taxes.
21-11-2017T17:25:59,qwe304,pretty sure they made people house and feed soldiers too
21-11-2017T17:25:59,Sammit,i liked the minor faction Followers of the Apocalypse and The Boomers
21-11-2017T17:26:09,Sammit,Factions*

21-11-2017T17:27:09,TorqueEmUp,"Nope, I actually got them and the NCR to be nice to eachother"
21-11-2017T17:27:18,Sammit,i used them to get the power armors
21-11-2017T17:28:28,Sammit,i also got the Enclave  Remnants  to help in the battle
21-11-2017T17:28:52,qwe304,i used the enclave for that
21-11-2017T17:29:11,qwe304,to get the power armor training i mean

21-11-2017T21:38:20,BluePhantom90,thats how people get sick though winter. Never letting new air in can cause that issue.

21-11-2017T21:39:17,MarvTheHugPharaoh,too much sleep and not a lot moving can also make one feel that way
21-11-2017T21:39:37,MidnightBlue78,I wish I had some advice for you Tom
21-11-2017T21:39:46,BadFoMo,Same.
21-11-2017T21:40:04,MidnightBlue78,"i feel that way too most of the time, i ha dragging myself everyday"

21-11-2017T21:41:09,unsteddyphoenix,Lol Tom suddenly has become a lot more relatable true
21-11-2017T21:41:19,BluePhantom90,"And Tom you don't do much working out, or get out and move around can cause the Sluggish feeling. Need to do some exercise"
21-11-2017T21:41:32,MarvTheHugPharaoh,^
21-11-2017T21:41:44,MidnightBlue78,maybe go out for a walk or something
21-11-2017T21:41:57,TorqueEmUp,Out in some nice brisk air.
21-11-2017T21:41:58,Serpentfrog,Don't judge my lifestyle choices.
21-11-2017T21:41:58,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"every once in a blue moon its good to get out and walk around for a bit, maybe even run"
21-11-2017T21:41:59,MidnightBlue78,doesn't have to be a very long walk
21-11-2017T21:42:00,unsteddyphoenix,Take anti allergy meds and pet your cat
21-11-2017T21:42:14,Combak,A bike ride may be a decent option.
21-11-2017T21:42:18,CaptainJack,i bought a treadmill and put it in front of my tv now i play xbox while working out
21-11-2017T21:42:40,RandomTKLover,"Have we been pushing you too hard? Oh no, now I feel bad."
21-11-2017T21:42:51,TorqueEmUp,"I know if I don't go outside at least once a day, I feel super sluggish."
21-11-2017T21:42:58,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"it does not have to be a work out, just something that makes sure all the parts are not gummed up"
21-11-2017T21:43:17,CaptainJack,dang it randomtk now i feel bad cause i didn’t think of that before
21-11-2017T21:44:02,Serpentfrog,Tom works as hard as he wants to work. We only encourage him.
21-11-2017T21:44:14,CaptainJack,true
21-11-2017T21:44:18,TorqueEmUp,"like even just going out, and driving somewhere, and then coming back home I feel a lot more awake, otherwise I just feel slow."
21-11-2017T21:45:10,BluePhantom90,Lol it what happens when you don't do much moving around and just sleep all the time. You need to get some movement and some exercise. A walk around the mall or checking out some stuff you want for Christmas helps a bit.
21-11-2017T21:48:06,unsteddyphoenix,Meirl
21-11-2017T21:48:18,unsteddyphoenix,One day i'll go to the gym again...
