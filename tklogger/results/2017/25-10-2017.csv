25-10-2017T00:42:53,MaxHernandez,My wifi says 81mbps... Doesnt seem like it tho
25-10-2017T00:43:02,hillbillyinablimp,might as well be watching on a motorola razor
25-10-2017T00:43:28,Bgrmystr2,"Probably the wirless connection speed, not the internet speed."
25-10-2017T00:43:35,MaxHernandez,True
25-10-2017T00:43:40,hillbillyinablimp,Mine is wired :^)

25-10-2017T02:44:39,MarvTheHugPharaoh,no clue
25-10-2017T02:44:58,Dadrobit,"He was amazing in Pursuit of Happyness, so obviously his acting must have only gotten better"
25-10-2017T02:45:23,Dadrobit,stalls further while his PlayStation updates.
25-10-2017T02:45:34,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD

25-10-2017T02:58:40,MarvTheHugPharaoh,oki doki
25-10-2017T02:58:42,Dadrobit,"Ah, probably for the best then."
25-10-2017T02:58:43,Bgrmystr2,probably a good idea to sleep on it
25-10-2017T02:59:03,Twokinds,It'll probably be up by 3pm tomorrow
25-10-2017T02:59:14,MarvTheHugPharaoh,cool
25-10-2017T02:59:20,Bgrmystr2,sounds about right xD

25-10-2017T03:00:57,MarvTheHugPharaoh,WooHoo \o/
25-10-2017T03:01:22,Bgrmystr2,I'm an hour earlier. I usually have my phone start waking me up at 2pm so I don't miss early streams
25-10-2017T03:01:31,Bgrmystr2,since I'm central
25-10-2017T03:02:10,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I don't think there's gonna be a stream for dialog
25-10-2017T03:02:28,Dadrobit,"MST here, so the comic should be up around noon tomorrow."
25-10-2017T03:02:30,Twokinds,lol yeah no stream tomorrow
25-10-2017T03:03:36,Twokinds,"watching someone write on stream wouldn't probably be very entertaining,"
25-10-2017T03:03:50,Dadrobit,It would be enrapturing
25-10-2017T03:03:59,Bgrmystr2,"well, we do every time you add text during the stream though"
25-10-2017T03:04:05,MarvTheHugPharaoh,it could be good for some laughs
25-10-2017T03:04:41,Bgrmystr2,"haha have a stream just to make a ""Fill in the blanks"" from the chat, for humorus captions xD"
25-10-2017T03:04:44,Dadrobit,"Huh, Balto is trending on the front page, odd."
