22-11-2017T13:23:13,TorqueEmUp,Merry Turkey day Midnight. ^^
22-11-2017T16:09:45,PalmettoPathfinder1,Happy Thanksgiving everyone!
22-11-2017T16:23:02,PalmettoPathfinder1,I see that Tom did a stream today.  Anyone know what he drew?
22-11-2017T16:23:40,Bgrmystr2,"uh. Today? 16 hours ago, bro"
22-11-2017T16:24:18,PalmettoPathfinder1,Oh never mind.  I see it was the comic.  Well I was probably asleep or getting things ready for company.   :)
22-11-2017T16:24:43,Bgrmystr2,He did page 1 of Chapter 11 yesterday afternoon
22-11-2017T16:25:21,Bgrmystr2,mmmmm 10pm Eastern? or so
22-11-2017T16:26:05,PalmettoPathfinder1,"That's good to hear.  So a new chapter begins.  That's good to hear.  And yep, I was with my family around that time."
22-11-2017T16:28:01,Bgrmystr2,Dude we're on chapter 19 ._.
22-11-2017T16:28:32,Bgrmystr2,Chapter 11 began in 2008
22-11-2017T16:29:09,Bgrmystr2,It's gonna be the page before this one. http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/445/
22-11-2017T16:34:02,PalmettoPathfinder1,Sorry. My brain went into lag mode.
22-11-2017T16:36:49,PalmettoPathfinder1,"So he's tidying up so old pages.  You know I got some of his original pages.  Like when Trace dreams of that female Keidran killing someone back in chapter 1?  Originally it was a Tigress, but in the book it's a wolf."
22-11-2017T16:46:09,Bgrmystr2,It was a completely new page to transition the previous chapter to the next one. It's for book 4
22-11-2017T16:46:18,Bgrmystr2,he's talked about it in the chat this week
22-11-2017T16:46:35,Bgrmystr2,not a tidying up in this case.
22-11-2017T16:49:52,PalmettoPathfinder1,Okay.  Well has he said when he thinks book 4 will be out?
22-11-2017T17:01:41,Bgrmystr2,"He's previously stated a end of the year release, but this was apparently months ago, perhaps more than a year ago? I don't actually know."
22-11-2017T17:01:54,Bgrmystr2,"But it was a while back, so it remains to be seen"
22-11-2017T17:02:03,Bgrmystr2,"he is working on it, though, so there is that."
22-11-2017T17:19:33,PalmettoPathfinder1,Okay.   Well I'm looking forward to seeing the next book.
22-11-2017T17:56:52,Dadrobit,"Happy Turkey Day folks, just pulled mine out of the oven. Good times"

22-11-2017T18:34:58,MidnightBlue78,:ctwokinds-sadtrace2: why?
22-11-2017T18:36:40,Twokinds,Do they not have turkey over there?
22-11-2017T18:37:11,Twokinds,I hadn't even considered that some places do not have turkeys. I guess that makes sense.
22-11-2017T18:37:52,unsteddyphoenix,Well more like we dont give thanks
22-11-2017T18:38:17,MidnightBlue78,"ah, i see"
22-11-2017T18:38:25,unsteddyphoenix,Most of the world is decidedly unthankful
22-11-2017T18:38:34,MidnightBlue78,"yeah, true"
22-11-2017T18:39:04,MidnightBlue78,People just wanna eat til food comes outte their noses
22-11-2017T18:39:19,MidnightBlue78,*outta
22-11-2017T18:39:24,Bgrmystr2,Considering it's a holiday based in the US... it doesn't surprise me that noone else would really celebrate it.
22-11-2017T18:40:07,BluePhantom90,hello all
22-11-2017T18:40:28,unsteddyphoenix,Im jealous tho
22-11-2017T18:40:38,unsteddyphoenix,I want cranberry sauce
22-11-2017T18:40:58,unsteddyphoenix,And those potato things
22-11-2017T18:41:05,MidnightBlue78,my thanksgiving meal turned out pretty decent for not wanting to make it at all
22-11-2017T18:41:40,MidnightBlue78,hey Blue
22-11-2017T18:42:14,BluePhantom90,eh mine was alright... then went to game stop to pick up something and had to wait 2 hours just to pick up something I already bought... it would have taken me 2 min but nope! e-e
22-11-2017T18:49:54,Twokinds,I didn't even have turkey anyway XD
22-11-2017T18:50:35,Twokinds,I had biscuts and gravy.  Which I hear is also a mostly American thing.
22-11-2017T18:52:03,BluePhantom90,Should make a Twokinds Thanksgiving with Flora and Nat fighting for the Turkey
22-11-2017T18:52:52,unsteddyphoenix,Dont americans say cookies not biscuit?
22-11-2017T18:53:13,FenceEqualizer,Nope.
22-11-2017T18:53:16,BluePhantom90,no we say biscuits.
22-11-2017T18:55:06,LeKnightWolf,:ok_hand::cookie::beer:
22-11-2017T18:55:25,unsteddyphoenix,Oh neat
22-11-2017T18:55:35,LeKnightWolf,indeed
22-11-2017T18:55:36,BluePhantom90,Had EU guys look at me weird when I had pancakes sausage and poured maple syrup on all of it.
22-11-2017T18:55:53,BluePhantom90,*and sausage
22-11-2017T18:55:56,unsteddyphoenix,Seems ok?
22-11-2017T18:56:25,unsteddyphoenix,Biscuits and gravy seems weird tho
22-11-2017T18:56:26,BluePhantom90,"To the British guy he looked at me saying "" That's disgusting"""
22-11-2017T18:56:30,FenceEqualizer,The hell? What do they have aginst syrup?
22-11-2017T18:56:47,Bgrmystr2,"That's cuz British people don't know what disgusting is, Blue."
22-11-2017T18:56:52,Bgrmystr2,Easy enough.
22-11-2017T18:57:04,LeKnightWolf,hmm.
22-11-2017T18:57:24,BluePhantom90,pouring Maple syrup on my sausages that I ate. I don't makes them taste better
22-11-2017T18:57:43,BluePhantom90,"*I don't know, it makes them taste better"
22-11-2017T18:57:51,BluePhantom90,My english is failing me today
22-11-2017T18:57:57,Bgrmystr2,I would think it tastes better. But I like syrup cuz it's sweet.
22-11-2017T18:58:08,Bgrmystr2,Maybe they just have zero sweet tooth.
22-11-2017T18:58:18,Bgrmystr2,lotta countries seem to be like that.
22-11-2017T18:58:46,FenceEqualizer,It's okay. That's why we separated from the British.  They had no taste.
22-11-2017T18:59:17,Bgrmystr2,haha
22-11-2017T18:59:59,Twokinds,Uh... buscuts are not cookies
22-11-2017T19:00:11,Twokinds,Buscuits are like... bread.
22-11-2017T19:00:30,Bgrmystr2,yeah
22-11-2017T19:01:16,FenceEqualizer,Cookies and gravy
22-11-2017T19:01:27,unsteddyphoenix,Ahh
22-11-2017T19:01:35,FenceEqualizer,:ptv-grossedout:
22-11-2017T19:01:55,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah, right?"
22-11-2017T19:02:10,Bgrmystr2,"I don't eat gravy anyway, so eh"
22-11-2017T19:02:13,unsteddyphoenix,Was iffy on it lol
22-11-2017T19:02:14,BluePhantom90,"there was some things we say differently then most countries. got to look this up because in Afghanistan the people would say ""biscuit"" and we all thought that meant ""Food"""
22-11-2017T19:02:25,Twokinds,And they gravy isn't like the stuff you put on mashed potatoes.
22-11-2017T19:02:29,Twokinds,So it's hard to explain...
22-11-2017T19:02:39,unsteddyphoenix,Wait what
22-11-2017T19:02:47,Twokinds,It's a different kind of gravy.
22-11-2017T19:03:03,unsteddyphoenix,So its not biscuits OR gravy then
22-11-2017T19:03:11,unsteddyphoenix,Gotcha
22-11-2017T19:03:30,Twokinds,Well it is. It's just... different kind of biscuits and gravy.
22-11-2017T19:04:22,BluePhantom90,You mean the bits of meat in the gravy and looks gray? Loved that stuff with biscuits and gravy
22-11-2017T19:04:48,FenceEqualizer,Didn't know there was a different term for gravy
22-11-2017T19:05:00,FenceEqualizer,Always picture that sludge you put on mashed potatoes
22-11-2017T19:05:10,BluePhantom90,its not a term just different styles of gravy
22-11-2017T19:05:36,BluePhantom90,Like gumbo. anyone know what Gumbo is?
22-11-2017T19:06:11,FenceEqualizer,o/ Have family in Mississippi
22-11-2017T19:07:10,BluePhantom90,"yeah people make Gumbo as different as Gravy. some put chunks of sausage in it, to mushrooms, and so on"
22-11-2017T19:10:22,Dadrobit,Guys... I think my cat may be defective...
22-11-2017T19:10:35,BluePhantom90,how so?
22-11-2017T19:10:38,BadFoMo,What happened?
22-11-2017T19:10:43,MidnightBlue78,what's wrong with kitty?
22-11-2017T19:11:05,Dadrobit,Tried sharing some of my (friggin' delicious) turkey with her and she totally snubbed it.
22-11-2017T19:11:18,BluePhantom90,lol
22-11-2017T19:11:47,BluePhantom90,BTW Tom sooo your brother took a bath in mash potato's.... what do you have to say about that?
22-11-2017T19:11:48,Dadrobit,"On the plus side, more for me."
22-11-2017T19:11:56,unsteddyphoenix,Lol i love defective cats
22-11-2017T19:12:18,Dadrobit,Spatchcock cooking is my new favorite method of turkey baking
22-11-2017T19:12:40,Dadrobit,Done in an hour and tastes awesome.

22-11-2017T19:12:45,unsteddyphoenix,My friends cat has a bug where if you scratch her right shoulder she licks her left leg
22-11-2017T19:13:02,Dadrobit,"""a bug"" lol"
22-11-2017T19:13:30,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah sloppy cat coding

22-11-2017T19:15:38,Dadrobit,"Nope, my cat is very cat like"
22-11-2017T19:15:51,unsteddyphoenix,Or cats that chase the thing then domt bring it back cause YOURE JUST GONNA THROW IT AGAIN
22-11-2017T19:16:05,Glassan,"Of course. Refusing food because you are offering it, rather than giving into demands..."
22-11-2017T19:16:07,unsteddyphoenix,They know.
22-11-2017T19:16:20,Glassan,They do.
22-11-2017T19:16:48,Glassan,Just like they know they'll get the scritches they want if they sit in your way on a desk or keyboard.
22-11-2017T19:22:37,Dadrobit,Legends in the Legendary Fate Book of Fate hold a tale heralding a day in which I am able to tear cling wrap in the perfect amount on the first try without tangling the whole thing up 47 times.
22-11-2017T19:22:42,Dadrobit,Today is not that day.
22-11-2017T19:23:23,FenceEqualizer,Yet history refuse to change....
22-11-2017T19:23:38,Dadrobit,"But my food is successfully put away now, so I'll give myself some points for not gorging myself to death."

22-11-2017T19:25:20,Dadrobit,\o/
22-11-2017T19:25:44,FenceEqualizer,But the point of turkey day is to gorge yourself then regret your choice later!
22-11-2017T19:25:48,Dadrobit,Your accolades are what I'm thankful for this year Unsteddy.
22-11-2017T19:26:06,Glassan,"The food coma is real, yo."
22-11-2017T19:26:19,Dadrobit,"Well my little brother is gonna come over for a bit later today, so I'm saving some for him."
22-11-2017T19:26:40,Dadrobit,I'll probably enter the regret zone later.
22-11-2017T19:27:12,Dadrobit,"Oh, also walking, I'm super grateful for that. Walking is pretty nifty.\"
22-11-2017T19:29:34,FenceEqualizer,Walking helps get rid of the regret
