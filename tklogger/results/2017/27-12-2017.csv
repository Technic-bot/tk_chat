27-12-2017T01:54:01,RichterApokalypse,^
27-12-2017T01:54:10,Bgrmystr2,"Tom did a comic page, Beck"
27-12-2017T01:54:19,Bgrmystr2,you can see it in the recording
27-12-2017T01:54:25,Bgrmystr2,it'll prolly be up soon though
27-12-2017T01:54:34,Bgrmystr2,"give a couple hours, or maybe tomorrow"
27-12-2017T01:54:37,TheBeckoner,Yeah I was there at the beginning.
27-12-2017T01:54:45,TheBeckoner,Oh I guess he colored it too?
27-12-2017T01:54:48,Bgrmystr2,"well, that's all he did yeah"
27-12-2017T01:55:04,TheBeckoner,"Cool, I look forward to seeing it."
27-12-2017T01:55:19,Bgrmystr2,"he didn't finalize the text on screen, but did show it off"
27-12-2017T01:55:27,Bgrmystr2,prolly wanted to work on it more
27-12-2017T01:55:38,TheBeckoner,How long did he go for?
27-12-2017T01:56:04,Bgrmystr2,3 1/2 hrs
27-12-2017T01:56:37,TheBeckoner,"Oh ok, so about normal"
27-12-2017T01:57:24,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, he doesn't cut streams short often"
27-12-2017T01:58:11,KuroganeWatanoshi,oh?? I just fixed my internet and got back on and the stream is offline... welp
27-12-2017T01:58:31,Unenlagia,Yeah...
27-12-2017T01:58:37,KuroganeWatanoshi,rip
27-12-2017T01:58:53,Bgrmystr2,Fix it quicker :c
27-12-2017T01:58:56,TheBeckoner,"Well I'm on mobile, I just wanted to check in and see what was happening. See y'all"
27-12-2017T01:59:03,Unenlagia,Later
27-12-2017T01:59:11,KuroganeWatanoshi,Oh well. did he post the new comic page to the website?
27-12-2017T01:59:30,KuroganeWatanoshi,nope
27-12-2017T02:00:05,Unenlagia,"Started up the recording, I'm already laughing"
27-12-2017T02:00:18,Bgrmystr2,"Like I said earlier, he probably wanted to work on the text a bit more before he uploaded the page"
27-12-2017T02:00:23,KuroganeWatanoshi,"wait, did he even finish the comic page?"
27-12-2017T02:00:28,Bgrmystr2,since he didn't finalize the text before stopping
27-12-2017T02:00:32,KuroganeWatanoshi,oh
27-12-2017T02:01:07,Bgrmystr2,"the colors and shading are ""done"" according to him, but he always says that soo.. :thinking:"
27-12-2017T02:01:17,KuroganeWatanoshi,hmm
27-12-2017T02:01:27,ZRO4825,"he does this like...almost every week, lol"
27-12-2017T02:01:52,KuroganeWatanoshi,"Well, it kinda is a busy time for him though, right?"
27-12-2017T02:03:41,Unenlagia,It's a busy time for everyone.
27-12-2017T02:04:40,KuroganeWatanoshi,true. I need to do my New year's sketch and then the Keith Keiser piece for the next part of the project I am doing
27-12-2017T02:05:30,Unenlagia,Sounds neat
27-12-2017T02:05:34,KuroganeWatanoshi,yep
27-12-2017T02:35:18,Immarshallity,Hey what do you call a magic owl
27-12-2017T02:40:04,KuroganeWatanoshi,"I don't know, what do you call a magic owl?"
27-12-2017T02:44:45,unsteddyphoenix,Sounds like a hoot
27-12-2017T02:50:48,Immarshallity,Hoodini
27-12-2017T02:54:10,Dadrobit,"I woulda' guessed Hedwig, but that's just me."
27-12-2017T02:55:48,TheBeckoner,Anybody try this coca cola holiday flavor? its pretty good imo
27-12-2017T02:56:52,unsteddyphoenix,Owl allowl it
27-12-2017T02:57:01,TheBeckoner,too much
27-12-2017T02:57:51,TheBeckoner,Youve given me apundicitis
27-12-2017T02:58:08,Dadrobit,"His bird puns are in ""beak"" performance."
27-12-2017T02:58:56,Dadrobit,"Also, no, unfortunately I cannot do soda much anymore. Screws w/ my stomach."
27-12-2017T03:00:15,TheBeckoner,mmm thats unfortunate. Im sure I'll get to that point someday...or hopefully not.
27-12-2017T03:00:52,TheBeckoner,"I try to eat pretty good, its the candy that gets me."
27-12-2017T03:02:07,Dadrobit,"""Bored eating"" is my bugbear. Working from home w/ a ton of downtime leaves a lot of space for idle snacking."
27-12-2017T03:02:56,Dadrobit,"But I do well enough, 183lbs is pretty alright, but I'd like to drop a little more and get better muscle definition."
27-12-2017T03:04:24,unsteddyphoenix,I bored eat sometimes too~
27-12-2017T03:04:33,unsteddyphoenix,But I suck at gaining weight so
27-12-2017T03:05:06,unsteddyphoenix,We need to go get pumped dad
27-12-2017T03:05:34,Dadrobit,Gotta look good in those Haka performances.
27-12-2017T03:06:08,Dadrobit,^^^ Literally all I know of NZ culture
27-12-2017T03:06:22,unsteddyphoenix,s'all you need
27-12-2017T03:06:33,Dadrobit,lol
27-12-2017T03:08:25,TheBeckoner,"Yeah, whenever I wanna eat just cause, I drink water"
27-12-2017T03:08:42,Dadrobit,Hail Hydrate!
27-12-2017T03:08:45,TheBeckoner,"Although I could stand to gain some weight, Im 135 at 5'6"""
27-12-2017T03:08:51,TheBeckoner,lol
27-12-2017T03:09:48,TheBeckoner,I wish I was 183 and muscle lol I'd be huge
27-12-2017T03:10:07,Dadrobit,That's actually something of a problem in AZ. People mistake constant thirst with hunger and will eat instead of drink water. Makes for a lot of dehydration stories in the newspapers.
27-12-2017T03:11:02,TheBeckoner,yeah. its usually pretty wet here in Texas so you dont really get a dry sorta thirst. Atleast I dont
27-12-2017T03:11:11,Dadrobit,All the folks who travel here from northern areas and just aren't used to this kind of weather.
27-12-2017T03:11:21,TheBeckoner,its dry and hot correct?
27-12-2017T03:11:27,TheBeckoner,we have wet and hot
27-12-2017T03:12:12,Dadrobit,"Very, very dry. And I will stab the next person with their own femur that tries to tell me, ""but it's a dry heat!"""
27-12-2017T03:12:38,Dadrobit,"We got like two days that rained this year, sucks."
27-12-2017T03:13:49,unsteddyphoenix,Better dead than...humid
27-12-2017T03:14:47,TheBeckoner,Well hey the humidity keep yah young
27-12-2017T03:14:59,unsteddyphoenix,Do they say that?
27-12-2017T03:15:05,TheBeckoner,Yee
27-12-2017T03:15:31,TheBeckoner,Well I dunno if its true
27-12-2017T03:15:54,TheBeckoner,but hey my parents are middle aged and lookin pretty good so why not belive it? lol
27-12-2017T03:16:18,Dadrobit,It's probably definitely better than living in AZ sun. People who work outside look like wrinkled leather here.
27-12-2017T03:16:19,unsteddyphoenix,sure im in
27-12-2017T03:16:36,TheBeckoner,I'd assume its good for you though since your skin wants to be moist anyway
27-12-2017T03:17:06,TheBeckoner,"yeah and drier climate people tend to, as Robit said look like wrinkled leather"
27-12-2017T03:17:29,TheBeckoner,well atleat the ones that go outside
27-12-2017T03:18:58,Dadrobit,"Yeah, construction contractors and roadside jerky salespeople. They got it rough."
27-12-2017T03:24:31,unsteddyphoenix,They look like what they sell~
27-12-2017T03:24:45,unsteddyphoenix,"wait hold on, didnt you go sleep dad"
27-12-2017T03:25:21,Dadrobit,"Yeah, woke back up."
27-12-2017T03:25:34,TheBeckoner,yeah I know how it feels to work in the heat. It absolutely sucks until you start sweating.
27-12-2017T03:25:43,Dadrobit,Only got a  nap for whatever reason
27-12-2017T03:26:01,TheBeckoner,naps are good for people who go to sleep at 4 am (me)
27-12-2017T03:27:10,Dadrobit,"Probably not good for me. Planning on going out with grandma to the movies later today. Gonna go see The Shape of Water w/ her, grandaddy, and my bor."
27-12-2017T03:27:16,Dadrobit,bro*
27-12-2017T03:27:36,TheBeckoner,its also 2am there yes?
27-12-2017T03:28:21,unsteddyphoenix,review it for me
27-12-2017T03:28:43,Dadrobit,1:28 am
27-12-2017T03:28:49,Dadrobit,Will do.
27-12-2017T03:29:05,TheBeckoner,"oh, ok not as bad."
27-12-2017T03:29:31,Dadrobit,Planning on a 16:00 showing.
27-12-2017T03:29:40,TheBeckoner,just nap again before you go. Or drink like 300mg of caffeine
27-12-2017T03:30:54,Dadrobit,Get me a triple shot Americano on the double!
27-12-2017T03:31:08,TheBeckoner,heck yea
27-12-2017T03:31:35,TheBeckoner,"I've been drinking ""bang"" energy drinks, they are for working out, but I love em"
27-12-2017T03:31:41,TheBeckoner,no sugar
27-12-2017T03:31:48,TheBeckoner,and a TON of vitamins
27-12-2017T03:32:36,Dadrobit,Stuff like that is what ruined my stomach in the first place. 5 hr energies and their 5000% vitamin doses.
27-12-2017T03:32:57,Dadrobit,Used to do 2-3 a day in retail to keep up my checkout speed.
27-12-2017T03:33:07,Dadrobit,Now I got problems.
27-12-2017T03:33:07,TheBeckoner,woa
27-12-2017T03:33:13,TheBeckoner,I aint that crazy
27-12-2017T03:33:55,Dadrobit,Figured they were better than Monster and Redbull and stuff like that.
27-12-2017T03:34:11,TheBeckoner,Ive never drank more than one of these in a day since im sorta small and 600mg of caffeine is a bit much lol
27-12-2017T03:34:17,Dadrobit,Since it had fewer chemicals that I couldn't pronounce.
27-12-2017T03:34:22,TheBeckoner,lol
27-12-2017T03:34:58,TheBeckoner,well thats reasonable
27-12-2017T03:35:06,Dadrobit,I'm a fairly thick dude. But still. Shit's poison to me now.
27-12-2017T03:35:17,unsteddyphoenix,those taste gross thoughg
27-12-2017T03:35:26,TheBeckoner,Ive never had one actually
27-12-2017T03:35:49,Dadrobit,Berry wasn't so bad. The others are unpalatable though.
27-12-2017T03:38:28,TheBeckoner,"I like french press coffee too, it tastes super good"
27-12-2017T03:39:30,Dadrobit,Had an officer back in security that swore by that.
27-12-2017T03:40:39,TheBeckoner,"Its really good imo, much better than stuff like starbucks or the stuff you find in offices."
27-12-2017T03:40:48,TheBeckoner,man Im tired
27-12-2017T03:41:02,Dadrobit,The club I guarded had a Keurig that I used to send the patrol officers to fetch for me. Stuff was like crack.
27-12-2017T03:42:02,Dadrobit,They also had some of that literal shit coffee that I got tricked into consuming once.
27-12-2017T03:42:05,Dadrobit,Only once.
27-12-2017T03:42:33,TheBeckoner,"lol I had some coffee from a keurig once. The trash can finished that cup for me lol. Although it was probablt the stuff that was in it that was bad, a lot of people like the keurig"
27-12-2017T03:42:45,TheBeckoner,stuff
27-12-2017T03:43:07,TheBeckoner,yeah the stuff I find at offices and churches just utterly sucks
27-12-2017T03:44:34,unsteddyphoenix,...literal?
27-12-2017T03:45:05,Dadrobit,This was a suuuuuuper upper-crust country club. 10k a month sub fee or something like that. They had a lot of good shit. That coffee is fucking stupid.
27-12-2017T03:45:13,Dadrobit,"Yes, literal."
27-12-2017T03:45:40,Dadrobit,They feed the coffee beans to some small cat like animal and then harvest them when they pass through.
27-12-2017T03:45:55,Dadrobit,Several hundred dollars a bag
27-12-2017T03:46:01,Dadrobit,And an utter waste of money
27-12-2017T03:47:33,unsteddyphoenix,Sweet mother of christ
27-12-2017T03:47:46,unsteddyphoenix,now that you mention it I think I have heard of that before
27-12-2017T03:48:23,Dadrobit,https://www.twokinds.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=895688#p895688
27-12-2017T03:48:29,Dadrobit,The story of that night
27-12-2017T03:48:49,Dadrobit,"Sorry, it's a rodent, not a cat."
27-12-2017T03:48:54,Dadrobit,Even better...
27-12-2017T03:49:27,unsteddyphoenix,Are you SURE it was an accident
27-12-2017T03:50:00,Dadrobit,"Yeah, this officer in particular would definitely do something like this on accident."
27-12-2017T03:51:35,unsteddyphoenix,concerning sentence
27-12-2017T03:52:06,Dadrobit,"He was an idiot jaggalo, but he was honest."
27-12-2017T03:52:21,Dadrobit,juggalo*
27-12-2017T03:52:23,unsteddyphoenix,Haha he was a juggalo
27-12-2017T03:52:39,unsteddyphoenix,Is anyone around you normal or
27-12-2017T03:52:56,Dadrobit,"Yeah, had to wear long sleeves even in summer from the clown tattoos on his arms."
27-12-2017T03:53:08,Dadrobit,Literally no one.
27-12-2017T03:53:14,Dadrobit,I think it's the heat
27-12-2017T03:53:21,Dadrobit,Bakes the brain
27-12-2017T03:53:49,unsteddyphoenix,Like Salem
27-12-2017T03:53:55,unsteddyphoenix,"Except instead of drugs in the water,"
27-12-2017T03:53:56,unsteddyphoenix,No water
27-12-2017T03:54:53,Dadrobit,"We also had an IT guy get busted for being in an underage prostitution solicitation ring on his lunch break,"
27-12-2017T03:55:29,Dadrobit,The HOA was PISSED because he still had on his uniform in his mugshot.
27-12-2017T03:55:51,unsteddyphoenix,"Was he soliciting little boys, or was HE a little boy"
27-12-2017T03:56:17,Dadrobit,Dude was going after little girls. He was mid-thirties.
27-12-2017T03:56:43,Dadrobit,"Pretty sure he did heroin as well. Always had pricks on his arms from ""bed-bugs"""
27-12-2017T03:56:47,unsteddyphoenix,Next time he should be wealthier before attempting that.
27-12-2017T03:58:09,Dadrobit,https://www.twokinds.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=853204#p853204
27-12-2017T03:58:15,Dadrobit,There's that story lol
27-12-2017T03:58:52,unsteddyphoenix,noone wanted to touch that one I see
27-12-2017T04:00:21,Dadrobit,Spero was still around at that time. Dude took the proverbial spotlight almost everywhere he tried posting before his meltdown.
27-12-2017T04:00:51,Dadrobit,"Also, yeah, touchy subject."
27-12-2017T04:04:03,Dadrobit,"Oh, holy shit, just re-read your ""wealthier"" statement. Thought you said ""healthier"" at first, but this is much funnier lol."
27-12-2017T04:07:11,unsteddyphoenix,Feels too real man
27-12-2017T04:15:56,Dadrobit,"brb, gonna go grab a beverage"
27-12-2017T04:16:24,TheBeckoner,Serpo? like the serpentfrog dude?
27-12-2017T04:21:49,Dadrobit,Spero. SperoWolf. A kid that Alaric made gay.
27-12-2017T04:22:04,unsteddyphoenix,Not that specific
27-12-2017T04:22:32,Dadrobit,Ha
27-12-2017T04:22:54,TheBeckoner,Oh
27-12-2017T04:23:05,Dadrobit,He also wrote a gay fanfic about Trace. And made a YouTube channel for Undertale.
27-12-2017T04:23:13,TheBeckoner,yeah I have no clue i just read someone had a meltdown lol
27-12-2017T04:23:29,TheBeckoner,also sounds like a weird dude
27-12-2017T04:23:35,Dadrobit,Even changed his IRL name too for the sake of that game.
27-12-2017T04:23:41,TheBeckoner,woa
27-12-2017T04:23:50,TheBeckoner,crazy
27-12-2017T04:23:55,Dadrobit,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmuhCHpUymTgIwQUBYzEy5g/featured
27-12-2017T04:24:11,Dadrobit,He deleted all hi Undertale content it would seem.
27-12-2017T04:24:15,Dadrobit,his*
27-12-2017T04:24:27,unsteddyphoenix,Sounds like a Chris-chan type
27-12-2017T04:24:43,TheBeckoner,Im gonna regret clickin on this I can feel it
27-12-2017T04:26:07,TheBeckoner,maybe not? This content seems kinda ok not crazy like
27-12-2017T04:26:17,Dadrobit,"I mean, I never had a problem w/ the guy, even tried to help him w/ bettering his writing, but I know he rubbed a lot of people the wrong way."
27-12-2017T04:26:46,Dadrobit,That and it's really hard to end up on my shit-list. You really gotta try to make it there.
27-12-2017T04:27:57,TheBeckoner,Some of the vids are mildly entertaining
27-12-2017T04:28:18,TheBeckoner,"yeah, I tend not to care enough to remember the people I dont like lol"
27-12-2017T04:28:30,TheBeckoner,I forget literally everything
27-12-2017T04:30:03,Dadrobit,"He used to have a shitload of videos. Lots of Undertale theories, a couple that really got attention. Then he got kicked out by his mom and his computer broke down and made a post asking for donations. I guess whenever he finally came back, he decided to"
27-12-2017T04:30:09,Dadrobit,go for a different image.
27-12-2017T04:31:48,Dadrobit,"I'm pretty good at remembering shit, I just don't care. People just get too worked up over the internet."
27-12-2017T04:32:05,Dadrobit,"""Oh nooooo!!!! MAH PIXELS!!!"""
27-12-2017T04:32:51,TheBeckoner,"exactly. its the internet, you dont even know the person who offended you, get over it lol"
27-12-2017T04:33:44,Dadrobit,"I know a couple people here pretty well, but they're good folks."
27-12-2017T04:34:17,Dadrobit,"Except for w0lf, fuck that guy. Doesn't want to come down here and get an ultimate quesadilla with us..."
27-12-2017T04:34:30,Dadrobit,//sarcasm//
27-12-2017T04:34:31,TheBeckoner,Yeah I know nobody here.
27-12-2017T04:34:32,TheBeckoner,lol
27-12-2017T04:34:48,TheBeckoner,Most of y'all seem sane
27-12-2017T04:35:13,Dadrobit,"Went to Comic Con w/ Johny and Infinite, but those are the only ones I've actually met."
27-12-2017T04:35:53,Dadrobit,"w0lf was invited, but he had issues, something stupid about living 1000 miles away or something."
27-12-2017T04:36:24,TheBeckoner,that's so unreasonable.
27-12-2017T04:36:25,TheBeckoner,i mean
27-12-2017T04:36:28,TheBeckoner,just walk?
27-12-2017T04:36:30,TheBeckoner,duh

27-12-2017T04:36:38,Dadrobit,Seriously.
27-12-2017T04:36:59,Dadrobit,"His loss, no ultimate quesadilla for him!"
27-12-2017T04:37:04,TheBeckoner,"I walk a 1000 miles every nano second, I cant believe he wouldnt go"
27-12-2017T04:37:11,TheBeckoner,so easy
27-12-2017T04:37:24,TheBeckoner,whats this quesadilla?
27-12-2017T04:37:31,Dadrobit,"Yep, just gotta do it 500 miles at a time."
27-12-2017T04:37:48,TheBeckoner,1000/2 is 500
27-12-2017T04:37:51,TheBeckoner,basically 2 miles
27-12-2017T04:38:33,TheBeckoner,"Hmm it says iliar is a bot account, what does that mean?"
27-12-2017T04:39:11,Dadrobit,"There were a couple food trucks there. One was a Mexican food truck that offered ""The Ultimate Quesadilla"". It was a quesadilla that was just massive and came with everything you could ever want to eat."
27-12-2017T04:39:38,Dadrobit,"Like, just a three pound quesadilla full of steak and cheese and various other things."
27-12-2017T04:40:24,Dadrobit,Dunno?
27-12-2017T04:40:27,TheBeckoner,dang

27-12-2017T04:41:38,TheBeckoner,love*
27-12-2017T04:42:48,Dadrobit,"Dunno, maybe he uses it elsewhere and has it automated for stuff?"
27-12-2017T04:43:59,TheBeckoner,maybe maybe
27-12-2017T04:44:27,TheBeckoner,got a triwing screwdriver i can borrow? if so just shove it through your screen pleez

27-12-2017T04:47:11,Dadrobit,"Sorry, only phillips head and flat head."

27-12-2017T04:48:27,TheBeckoner,So what kinda music do you listen to? since we're stuck here without a triwing screwdriver...
27-12-2017T04:49:25,Dadrobit,Literally everything. Except country.
27-12-2017T04:51:08,TheBeckoner,"I'll listen to some country, but I don't have any favorite songs from the genre"
27-12-2017T04:51:41,TheBeckoner,Swing and classic rock is mostly what I consume
27-12-2017T04:52:54,Dadrobit,"For me to listen to country, it has to be damned near rock."
27-12-2017T04:54:52,TheBeckoner,yeah
27-12-2017T04:55:06,TheBeckoner,I grew up listening to it so its sorta there
27-12-2017T04:55:10,TheBeckoner,in my head
27-12-2017T04:55:23,TheBeckoner,kind of a neutral genre to me
27-12-2017T04:59:12,TheBeckoner,Have you found any short vids for your project next semester?
27-12-2017T05:00:36,TheBeckoner,Idk if anyone is here but my computer just deleted fallout 4
27-12-2017T05:00:40,TheBeckoner,lol cool
27-12-2017T05:02:05,Dadrobit,"No, haven't come across any new/interesting videos. I need to text my partner and see if he's found anything since I sent him my last idea."
27-12-2017T05:02:18,Dadrobit,"Also, GG Fallout."
27-12-2017T05:02:57,TheBeckoner,"Thats unfortunate, hopefully something pops up."
27-12-2017T05:03:11,TheBeckoner,and yeah I have no clue wtf happened to fo4
27-12-2017T05:03:21,Dadrobit,"Yeah, we'll be fine."

27-12-2017T05:10:55,unsteddyphoenix,So Sythe knew what Natani and Zen looked like even. So they met before?
27-12-2017T05:10:58,unsteddyphoenix,Did we know that?
27-12-2017T05:11:31,Dadrobit,Didn't see this past the sketch level. Interesting.
27-12-2017T05:11:52,Dadrobit,Maybe he heard the rumors of the Magi Brothers?
27-12-2017T05:12:10,unsteddyphoenix,Heard rumours of Nats amazing hair?
27-12-2017T05:12:32,Dadrobit,It's possible? It is pretty luxurious.
27-12-2017T05:13:04,Dadrobit,runs his fingers through what remains of his own...
27-12-2017T05:13:47,Dadrobit,"Not gonna lie, I'm not hot on the cartoon-ified Flora in the last panel."
27-12-2017T05:13:58,TheBeckoner,Yah goin bald?
27-12-2017T05:13:59,unsteddyphoenix,More likely than rumours of their pro

27-12-2017T05:15:18,Dadrobit,"Thought you were going for exaggeration on ""skills"" lol"
27-12-2017T05:15:41,TheBeckoner,hmm yeah that cartoon style hasnt really been used previously so it kind doesn't fit
27-12-2017T05:15:50,TheBeckoner,or not that i can remember..
27-12-2017T05:16:24,Dadrobit,"And no, I just needed to cut my hair for a photo shoot. It was just barely too short to fully pony-tail. And it was too unruly without banding."
27-12-2017T05:17:12,TheBeckoner,"thats about where mine is right now, wont stay off my eyeballs"
27-12-2017T05:17:52,Dadrobit,I'm actually super bummed about it.
27-12-2017T05:18:16,unsteddyphoenix,My hair is long but I cant run my hand through it cause its a curly mess
27-12-2017T05:18:24,Dadrobit,"But sister wanted a holiday family album, and it just wasn't going to do."
27-12-2017T05:19:18,TheBeckoner,yea that sucks. I have longish curly hair and it sorta places itself wherever it wants.
27-12-2017T05:19:21,Dadrobit,"Huh, that changes my image of you slightly, alright."

27-12-2017T16:24:01,DevlNuK,[Nuk System] Did you call me Random?
27-12-2017T16:24:35,RandomTKLover,"Yes, please tell dev to chear up. Tell him we are here for him"

27-12-2017T16:28:57,DevlNuK,[Nuk System] Waiting for questions ...
27-12-2017T16:29:30,RandomTKLover,Why are you depressed?
27-12-2017T16:29:57,DevlNuK,Because
27-12-2017T16:30:09,DevlNuK,I do not know ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
27-12-2017T16:33:04,RandomTKLover,But you seem like such a nice guy. There must be a reason
27-12-2017T16:38:45,RandomTKLover,Could you do a video chat?
27-12-2017T16:40:09,Bgrmystr2,You guys should just add each other on discord :v
27-12-2017T16:40:17,Bgrmystr2,so that way you can talk there all the time
27-12-2017T16:40:33,RandomTKLover,I should start using discord
27-12-2017T16:41:40,DevlNuK,Is there an option to ignore someone Bgr : -)
27-12-2017T16:42:51,Bgrmystr2,"Devl, that's irrelevant. :)"
27-12-2017T16:43:14,Bgrmystr2,Bringing it up more than once won't make it moreso.
27-12-2017T16:43:59,DevlNuK,And I want to be important? nop sry
27-12-2017T16:45:06,Bgrmystr2,"I literally don't know where you're going with this. I'm just saying you can chat on discord where there's way more chat options, as well as support for both audio chat and video sharing."
27-12-2017T16:45:24,Bgrmystr2,a lot of chat clients support that though
27-12-2017T16:45:46,RandomTKLover,"I said I don’t use it, sry to butt in"
27-12-2017T16:45:56,DevlNuK,I'm not taking this conversation to nowhere I'm just talking to Random I do not care
27-12-2017T16:46:45,DevlNuK,￢_￢
27-12-2017T16:46:48,Bgrmystr2,And there's the problem. :v
27-12-2017T16:47:15,DevlNuK,what problem?
27-12-2017T16:47:36,Bgrmystr2,"I'm not saying you can't chat here, but this isn't a private chat between the two of you. If you want one, you should get one, but you shouldn't treat this as such like you do."
27-12-2017T16:48:02,Bgrmystr2,That's all I'm sayin. :thumbsup:
27-12-2017T16:48:50,DevlNuK,BUT NOT A PRIVATE. We are just talking normally
27-12-2017T16:49:26,DevlNuK,but thanks for your opinion :v::punch:
27-12-2017T16:49:36,RandomTKLover,Im so confused
27-12-2017T16:49:47,DevlNuK,Xd
27-12-2017T16:50:19,Bgrmystr2,"You're treating this like a private chat, not a public one. If you can't see the difference, that's ok, I'm just telling you there /is/ a difference and you're on the wrong side of it."
27-12-2017T16:50:28,DevlNuK,he thinks that the fact that I can not spend the end of the year with my family and a subject just between you and me Random
27-12-2017T16:50:43,RandomTKLover,"I am very new to the online chat thind, and I (no joke) always thought discord was a game"
27-12-2017T16:51:03,RandomTKLover,4 subjects at once 😂
27-12-2017T16:51:18,Bgrmystr2,"Also, Devl, you can't have a subject that's just in between the two of you, because this isn't a chat between the two of you :v. I'm here too."
27-12-2017T16:51:27,Bgrmystr2,as are 13 other people.
27-12-2017T16:52:03,Bgrmystr2,Granted they are lurking.
27-12-2017T16:52:56,RandomTKLover,But aren’t the whispers private?
27-12-2017T16:53:04,DevlNuK,"But I do not care about it, you do not understand yet I told you if you do not want to see my messages, just ignore  (-_- )"
27-12-2017T16:53:09,Bgrmystr2,Whispers are private yes
27-12-2017T16:53:55,Bgrmystr2,"Devl, that's not the point. You wouldn't go into a public area irl and expect to have a private conversation without someone being able to butt into it, would you?"
27-12-2017T16:53:57,Bgrmystr2,same thing here.
27-12-2017T16:54:16,RandomTKLover,Wait can we just calm down for a moment
27-12-2017T16:54:34,Bgrmystr2,I'm calm. :) Just making a statement
27-12-2017T16:54:58,RandomTKLover,"Your speech says otherwise, both of you"
27-12-2017T16:55:30,RandomTKLover,We are all getting too flustered over some stupid argument
27-12-2017T16:55:45,RandomTKLover,Let’s just forget it
27-12-2017T16:55:49,Bgrmystr2,Maybe. It's not like you run into someone who has no idea how public and private chats work. :)
27-12-2017T16:55:59,Bgrmystr2,not everyday
27-12-2017T16:56:05,Bgrmystr2,it's a pretty rare occurance
27-12-2017T16:56:17,RandomTKLover,What did I just say :ptv-angry:
27-12-2017T16:56:20,DevlNuK,Ignored
27-12-2017T16:56:32,RandomTKLover,Omg
27-12-2017T16:56:53,RandomTKLover,:expressionless:
27-12-2017T16:57:11,Bgrmystr2,":thumbsup: S'alright random. I'm not the only person who feels this way, it's just a matter of time before someone else says something."
27-12-2017T16:58:19,DevlNuK,Best music for this moment https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wO5TnYaJ4o
27-12-2017T16:58:29,RandomTKLover,"For the purposes of nut hating each other when we see each others name in chat, we’re all wrong"
27-12-2017T16:58:40,Bgrmystr2,I just happen to be one of the few people willing to speak up.
27-12-2017T16:58:47,Bgrmystr2,"and no Random, that's not how it works. xD"
27-12-2017T16:58:54,Bgrmystr2,I don't hate anyone
27-12-2017T16:59:20,RandomTKLover,That enough
27-12-2017T16:59:27,RandomTKLover,All of you
27-12-2017T16:59:34,Bgrmystr2,all one of me? O.o
27-12-2017T16:59:47,RandomTKLover,-_-
27-12-2017T16:59:57,DevlNuK,You're never wrong then ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
27-12-2017T17:00:22,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: I thought I was ignored
27-12-2017T17:01:12,RandomTKLover,16:58

27-12-2017T22:57:02,Dadrobit,o/
27-12-2017T22:57:18,DevlNuK,me
27-12-2017T22:57:56,Dadrobit,"Very, very, very not safe for work. Don't bring the kids."
27-12-2017T22:58:10,DevlNuK,Blue Fursona of paper for pc  https://imgur.com/w84m76Z
27-12-2017T22:58:11,Dadrobit,I basically just watched a porno with my grandparents.
27-12-2017T22:58:15,DevlNuK,XD
27-12-2017T22:58:46,KuroganeWatanoshi,wonder if anyone has a Discord

27-12-2017T22:59:43,Dadrobit,"Like, 3 minutes in and the main character was going to town on herself in the bath. No censors."
27-12-2017T22:59:55,DevlNuK,lol
27-12-2017T23:00:04,Dadrobit,Very awkward sitting next to grandma....
27-12-2017T23:19:11,unsteddyphoenix,Noted
27-12-2017T23:19:14,unsteddyphoenix,Any good though?
27-12-2017T23:20:05,Dadrobit,"It was definitely not my usual fare, but it was pretty alright. It was like watching a French film, but Americanized."
27-12-2017T23:20:18,DevlNuK,Hey Teddy
27-12-2017T23:20:43,unsteddyphoenix,Hopefully that's better than watching an americanised japanese film
27-12-2017T23:20:53,unsteddyphoenix,Still mad about Death Note
27-12-2017T23:21:13,unsteddyphoenix,'lo
27-12-2017T23:21:25,Dadrobit,"Also, there were a bunch of racist old people in the theater. Like, being set in 1962, there were slurs thrown around and shit right?"
27-12-2017T23:21:51,unsteddyphoenix,"Sure, 'twas the era"
27-12-2017T23:21:57,Dadrobit,"But a couple of folks in the audience kept on laughing at them, when it really was not meant to be funny."
27-12-2017T23:22:53,unsteddyphoenix,Haha
27-12-2017T23:23:00,unsteddyphoenix,They miss it
27-12-2017T23:23:06,Dadrobit,But that's just a personal experience thing for me. It really disengaged my attention whenever it happened.
27-12-2017T23:24:19,Dadrobit,"Michael Shannon was the main baddie .I love a good bad guy, and he friggin' nailed it imo."
27-12-2017T23:25:08,Dadrobit,"The cast in general was good, but he absolutely sold it."
27-12-2017T23:25:39,unsteddyphoenix,VIllians are at least as important as the protagonists imo
27-12-2017T23:26:31,Dadrobit,"Yup, fully agree."
27-12-2017T23:28:19,Dadrobit,"Brb, gonna get a drink."
27-12-2017T23:30:22,DevlNuK,"Zzzzzzzzz~I'm going to sleep until this night. Good Night, guys.!"
27-12-2017T23:37:54,Dadrobit,Back.
27-12-2017T23:40:32,Dadrobit,"But yeah, not sure how I'd rate it honestly. There was just something... Unsettling about that movie besides just watching a lady fuck a fish with a bunch of old racist people.... It all just felt very uncanny..."
27-12-2017T23:40:59,unsteddyphoenix,Perhaps that was intentional? It sure sounds like it.
27-12-2017T23:42:49,TheBeckoner,lol  sounds like a fun movie
27-12-2017T23:51:03,Dadrobit,Probably certainly intentional. Guillermo del Toro was the director. Dude does weird stuff.
27-12-2017T23:53:54,TheBeckoner,What was it called again?
