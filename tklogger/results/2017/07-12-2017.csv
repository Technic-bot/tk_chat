07-12-2017T17:08:25,Devlfry,I like

07-12-2017T17:12:14,Devlfry,truth

07-12-2017T17:19:13,TheBeckoner,or threatened potentially
07-12-2017T17:20:38,Devlfry,"So this is strange if you say ""Today I ate a kale""?"
07-12-2017T17:22:53,Dadrobit,"Only grammatically. The proper wording would be ""ate a leaf of kale"" or ""ate a kale leaf""."
07-12-2017T17:23:36,TheBeckoner,Not strange if kale is your intimate partner
07-12-2017T17:23:45,TheBeckoner,wait

07-12-2017T17:24:52,Devlfry,Beck a sincere question
07-12-2017T17:25:19,TheBeckoner,sure
07-12-2017T17:26:04,Devlfry,Do you have something against Brazilians or have you heard someone speak?
07-12-2017T17:28:11,TheBeckoner,"I have no problems with anyone, Brazilians included. Did I say something that made you think that? If I did I apologize as  that was not my intent."
07-12-2017T17:28:40,TheBeckoner,And im not sure if I've ever heard a brazilian in person tbh
07-12-2017T17:29:12,Devlfry,"No, you did not say anything.  the fact that I see a lot of racism on the internet"
07-12-2017T17:30:35,Devlfry,I have the feeling people from other countries have something against Brazilians
07-12-2017T17:33:20,TheBeckoner,"Well I in particular have no problems with any kind of people, so you wont get any racism from my end :blush:"
07-12-2017T17:33:43,Devlfry,"But okay, thanks for your sincerity."
07-12-2017T17:35:21,Devlfry,I think if I spoke in Portuguese it would be like keidran for you xp

07-12-2017T17:35:59,TheBeckoner,"I got english, a bit of spanish and if you spoke german slow enough I may would get that too"

07-12-2017T17:36:04,Devlfry,oi tudo bem beck como voce esta
07-12-2017T17:37:52,TheBeckoner,I believe that is asking something about me lol
07-12-2017T17:38:15,Devlfry,"Hi, how are you? All right, Beck. How are you?"
07-12-2017T17:39:29,Devlfry,But I think English is still a world language everyone knows a little
07-12-2017T17:39:52,TheBeckoner,Its the current latin of its day
07-12-2017T17:40:08,Devlfry,yes

07-12-2017T19:02:42,Dinoman515,O_O
07-12-2017T19:03:13,PalmettoPathfinder1,"I get that it'll charge us on the anniversary of when we subscribed to a creator, but according to what I've read it starts on December 18.  I just got charged on December 1.  Does that mean I'll be charged again on December 18 as well?"
07-12-2017T19:06:29,TheBeckoner,good question
07-12-2017T19:06:47,TheBeckoner,I subbed not to long ago as well
07-12-2017T19:08:16,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Yeah, I don't even remember the dates of my subscriptions.  I'm going to have to withdraw several of my pledges ."
07-12-2017T19:10:29,CrRAR,In the FAQ:
07-12-2017T19:10:32,CrRAR,"""The new rates will apply to your monthly pledges starting December 18th so you'll see your first payment with the fee included January 1st, 2018."""
07-12-2017T19:11:02,TheBeckoner,ah that makes sense

07-12-2017T19:13:58,CrRAR,be careful
07-12-2017T19:14:09,Devlfry,ok ok
07-12-2017T19:14:10,Bgrmystr2,Not a fan of this new payment thing Patreon is doing.
07-12-2017T19:14:29,CrRAR,Mmm it seems like a drastic change...
07-12-2017T19:14:37,Devlfry,not by PC and by hand
07-12-2017T19:14:47,CrRAR,It's not like the fee never came out of your pledge
07-12-2017T19:15:02,Bgrmystr2,yeah but it's bad for creators
07-12-2017T19:15:17,CrRAR,Yeah
07-12-2017T19:15:19,Bgrmystr2,"because someone did the math, and instead of getting around 82% or something of the money people paid"
07-12-2017T19:15:22,CrRAR,Tough PR move.
07-12-2017T19:15:25,Bgrmystr2,they now get about 75%
07-12-2017T19:15:40,CrRAR,hmm
07-12-2017T19:16:25,CrRAR,"Yeah and I heard it impacts lower pledge amounts higher, considering the structure has a flat fee component part of the equation."
07-12-2017T19:17:05,CrRAR,It's weird though the way they explain the way it worked before says the fees RANGED from 7-15% or something.
07-12-2017T19:17:19,CrRAR,I wonder if it depended on the funding source?
07-12-2017T19:17:34,CrRAR,Like Mastercard vs Visa vs Amex
07-12-2017T19:18:31,CrRAR,So they came up with a new fee structure that displaces the weight differently.
07-12-2017T19:18:35,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Yeah.  I got someone I'm pledging for $99.99 right now and another I'm doing $25 for and another one I'm doing $41 for as well.  So, I'm going to have to do some pausing and unpausing of my pledges."
07-12-2017T19:18:51,Bgrmystr2,"Oh, it's even less than I remember. like 80-85% down to 70% https://twitter.com/GibsonTwist/status/938510432582717441"
07-12-2017T19:19:30,Bgrmystr2,So creators are getting shafted on top of patrons getting shafted.
07-12-2017T19:19:36,PalmettoPathfinder1,"So, hopefully, Patreon will realize it's a bad idea before they start doing it.  I know that several creators aren't happy about it."
07-12-2017T19:19:38,CrRAR,Yeah
07-12-2017T19:19:39,Bgrmystr2,this is bad no matter how you look at it.
07-12-2017T19:19:45,TheBeckoner,lots of shaft
07-12-2017T19:19:55,Bgrmystr2,people pay more money and creators get LESS money
07-12-2017T19:19:59,Bgrmystr2,how exactly is this a good idea?
07-12-2017T19:19:59,CrRAR,"Anytime there's a NEW, EXCITING change it always has the devil in the details."
07-12-2017T19:20:13,TheBeckoner,"alright guys I'm gonna go, and hopefully I make it back before the stream"
07-12-2017T19:20:17,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Now, people are going to have to figure out when they started their subscriptions"
07-12-2017T19:20:24,Devlfry,it's a bad idea

07-12-2017T19:20:37,PalmettoPathfinder1,Wait....There's a stream tonight?
07-12-2017T19:20:45,CrRAR,It's FRIDAY
07-12-2017T19:20:50,PalmettoPathfinder1,Oh.
07-12-2017T19:21:00,PalmettoPathfinder1,I just noticed the stream schedule.
07-12-2017T19:21:02,PalmettoPathfinder1,DOH!
07-12-2017T19:21:02,CrRAR,Consult Maddie up the top.

07-12-2017T19:21:31,PalmettoPathfinder1,"So, what does Tom usually draw on Friday streams?"
07-12-2017T19:21:50,CrRAR,"Umm, Nora Cards and Comics and whatever"
07-12-2017T19:21:51,PalmettoPathfinder1,I know it says art but I've never been to one of his Friday streams before.
07-12-2017T19:21:56,Bgrmystr2,Whatever he has to do
07-12-2017T19:22:03,CrRAR,OH
07-12-2017T19:22:08,CrRAR,Sometimes Colin
07-12-2017T19:22:16,CrRAR,and... um... Sam
07-12-2017T19:22:16,Bgrmystr2,Friday streams are the longest running he has on that list XD
07-12-2017T19:22:30,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Ah okay.  So, has Tom said anything about the new payment plan?"
07-12-2017T19:22:35,CrRAR,...and a rare appearance of Wrinry
07-12-2017T19:22:38,Bgrmystr2,more than a year and a half I believe
07-12-2017T19:22:51,Bgrmystr2,"not that I know of, Palm"
07-12-2017T19:23:18,PalmettoPathfinder1,"I've been a patron of Tom's for about a year now, so I'm sad that I have to cancel my pledge to him now."
07-12-2017T19:23:54,Bgrmystr2,Tom might want to drop the pledges so that way they're just about equal to what people pay now.
07-12-2017T19:23:55,CrRAR,dumb Patreon
07-12-2017T19:23:59,CrRAR,y u so mean
07-12-2017T19:24:04,CrRAR,XD
07-12-2017T19:24:14,Bgrmystr2,tis what some people are doing
07-12-2017T19:24:23,PalmettoPathfinder1,@Bgrmystr2 what do you mean drop the pledges?
07-12-2017T19:24:37,Bgrmystr2,lowering the pledge amount required to pay.
07-12-2017T19:25:07,Bgrmystr2,"So instead of $10 you're paying now, You'd pay $10 + 35 cent plus the fee."
07-12-2017T19:25:29,Bgrmystr2,and some people are just lowering the pledge by that same percent and 35 cent
07-12-2017T19:25:57,Bgrmystr2,so you'd still pay $10 even after the change
07-12-2017T19:26:08,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Hm.....That....might work actually.  Although, me being a business major, I can see how this might help some creators especially those who have to hire staff and work as an organization, but those who rely on Patreon pledges to help pay bills and survive"
07-12-2017T19:26:15,PalmettoPathfinder1,will be severely hurt by this.
07-12-2017T19:26:41,Dinoman515,O_o
07-12-2017T19:27:10,PalmettoPathfinder1,"But, from the other side of the fence (patrons that is), it will hurt those who have small pledges spread out to multiple creators so now that they have to pick and choose."
07-12-2017T19:28:00,PalmettoPathfinder1,As well as worry over their budgets since it was easier to figure out one's budgets with the fees coming out on the first of each month.
07-12-2017T19:28:09,Bgrmystr2,it's not going to really help anyone honestly.
07-12-2017T19:28:27,Bgrmystr2,There's lots of creators coming out and saying it's a problem.
07-12-2017T19:28:40,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Yeah, in the short run it might be helpful to a few creators, but eventually, in the long run it will hurt everyone and not help anyone."
07-12-2017T19:28:41,CrRAR,Just like all the Net Neutrality conflict going on now. XD
07-12-2017T19:28:45,CrRAR,WE MUST FIGHT
07-12-2017T19:29:41,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Ugh.  The Net Neutrality thing is something I don't really worry about.  The reason: big corporations like Google, Amazon, and Yahoo (and Facebook) won't let the government take over the Net."
07-12-2017T19:30:21,CrRAR,"well, Verizon and Comcast and Time Warner control your ability to access the net and they can do some pretty shitty stuff."
07-12-2017T19:30:45,PalmettoPathfinder1,That's true.   Although Google and Amazon have a lot more power than them.
07-12-2017T19:31:12,Dinoman515,I talked about that last stream CrRAR... XD
07-12-2017T19:31:17,PalmettoPathfinder1,Oh?
07-12-2017T19:31:18,CrRAR,"Well, did you know that Comcast charges Netflix to not NOT throttle Nexflix streams?"
07-12-2017T19:31:22,Dinoman515,Well.. the one before that
07-12-2017T19:31:33,CrRAR,Essentially Comcast is already driving up the cost of Netflix.
07-12-2017T19:31:51,Dinoman515,"Woah, whats Nexflix?"
07-12-2017T19:31:53,CrRAR,It would get worse w/o Net Neutrality
07-12-2017T19:31:54,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Well, Netflix had to cancel House of Cards after the Spacey controversy."
07-12-2017T19:32:05,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
07-12-2017T19:32:13,PalmettoPathfinder1,That's what I've heard.
07-12-2017T19:32:37,CrRAR,"I'm just saying, those that hold the keys to accessing content are doing what they can to stragle the system for more money."
07-12-2017T19:32:46,CrRAR,It's sooo damn sad
07-12-2017T19:32:47,Bgrmystr2,"Palm, you do know the corporations are the ones trying to remove net neutrality right? The ones trying to make the net have fast and slow lanes? To make people pay them extra money to have ""normal"" speeds?"
07-12-2017T19:32:52,CrRAR,^
07-12-2017T19:33:00,Bgrmystr2,The corps are NOT the good guys in any scenario for this
07-12-2017T19:33:11,Bgrmystr2,It's not even remotely debatable either
07-12-2017T19:33:16,CrRAR,It's sad to me because it's the CREATORS we have to credit for the content.
07-12-2017T19:33:27,CrRAR,Not the damn distribution company.
07-12-2017T19:33:40,CrRAR,They should go suck eggs.
07-12-2017T19:33:51,CrRAR,"(Old timey saying, YEAh I said it)"
07-12-2017T19:33:54,PalmettoPathfinder1,I know.  What I was saying was that you're basically between a rock and a hard place: on one side you have the corporations trying to control stuff and the government on the other side trying to do the same thing.
07-12-2017T19:33:54,CrRAR,XD
07-12-2017T19:34:08,PalmettoPathfinder1,I probably could have worded it better though.
07-12-2017T19:34:20,CrRAR,Well the gov't is now happy to let it happen. *blegh*
07-12-2017T19:34:29,CrRAR,"No, it makes sense"
07-12-2017T19:34:33,CrRAR,Good job

07-12-2017T19:34:45,CrRAR,Indeed
07-12-2017T19:34:46,Bgrmystr2,they would destroy the internet as it stands
07-12-2017T19:34:58,Bgrmystr2,the govt benefits from the internet being open and free
07-12-2017T19:35:05,Bgrmystr2,"the corps do not,"
07-12-2017T19:35:11,PalmettoPathfinder1,"True.  But at the same time, the government would also censor stuff a lot more than the corporations would."
07-12-2017T19:35:25,Dinoman515,All the gov wants is $_$
07-12-2017T19:35:49,Bgrmystr2,"it's a lot of questionable grey area really, cuz there's a lot of good and bad people in the govt"
07-12-2017T19:35:57,CrRAR,"Well, gov't should be open to production of entertainment as it makes a population docile."
07-12-2017T19:36:12,CrRAR,Can't revolt GOTTA WATCH THE VOICE!

07-12-2017T19:36:57,PalmettoPathfinder1,"True.  Of course, nowadays you don't who's in the government as a lot of them are having to leave due to the sexual harassment scandals.  I mean you had one guy who was part of the Civil Rights Movement and one of the first Black Senators being forced to"
07-12-2017T19:36:59,PalmettoPathfinder1,retire.

07-12-2017T19:41:21,Dinoman515,I will die...
07-12-2017T19:41:24,CrRAR,awww
07-12-2017T19:41:27,PalmettoPathfinder1,I wonder: does necromancy exist in the TwoKinds universe?
07-12-2017T19:41:33,CrRAR,Ummm
07-12-2017T19:41:36,Dinoman515,PROBS
07-12-2017T19:42:16,Dinoman515,I AM SUBSCRIBING ON THE MARROW THO! I. NEED. THE. EMOJIS.
07-12-2017T19:42:22,CrRAR,I'm sure Trace has dabbled.
07-12-2017T19:42:36,CrRAR,sweet sweet emojis
07-12-2017T19:42:44,Dinoman515,"So, I can join in on the Nibbly Trains now!"
07-12-2017T19:42:50,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-clovischuckle:
07-12-2017T19:43:01,Bgrmystr2,XD Cr
07-12-2017T19:43:05,iZute,me too XD
07-12-2017T19:43:08,CrRAR,The Nibbly trains will be UNSTOPABLE
07-12-2017T19:43:11,CrRAR,*P
07-12-2017T19:43:14,Bgrmystr2,"Trace tried to bring his wife back, Palm"
07-12-2017T19:43:18,Dinoman515,OwO yes they will
07-12-2017T19:43:19,iZute,i need them emotes XD
07-12-2017T19:43:24,Bgrmystr2,it nearly destroyed him.
07-12-2017T19:43:39,Bgrmystr2,"you should probably, you know, read the comic"
07-12-2017T19:43:44,CrRAR,lol
07-12-2017T19:43:51,Bgrmystr2,it actually explains things. Like it has a story or something
07-12-2017T19:43:53,Dinoman515,"Mhmm, Bleck Magic. As dangerous as a pack of Cigarettes."
07-12-2017T19:44:06,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-wondering: imagine that.. a comic telling a story
07-12-2017T19:44:06,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Well, according to what I've read: you can do it, but it kills you before you can do it.  My question is this: what if you're already dead, can you still use necromancy without the negative side effects?  like a lich."
07-12-2017T19:44:41,iZute,maybe? i dont know if black bagic can doube kill someone
07-12-2017T19:44:41,Bgrmystr2,"I don't think you can do anything as a ghost, really"
07-12-2017T19:44:43,PalmettoPathfinder1,Wait....do Lichs even exist in the TwoKinds universe?  Do the Undead exist in the TwoKinds universe at all?
07-12-2017T19:44:59,Bgrmystr2,Saria was a ghost
07-12-2017T19:45:02,Bgrmystr2,so that's a thing
07-12-2017T19:45:03,iZute,"palmetto, have you read the comic?"
07-12-2017T19:45:07,Dinoman515,For a breif while.
07-12-2017T19:45:16,Bgrmystr2,"I don't know if he has, Zute. XD"
07-12-2017T19:45:20,Bgrmystr2,I question it more every time.
07-12-2017T19:45:33,CrRAR,"Well, considering that one sketch where Trace saved Laura from internal injuries.... maybe it would cost you your entire life?"
07-12-2017T19:45:44,CrRAR,Like Trace was pretty injured fixing her organs.
07-12-2017T19:46:04,Dinoman515,I am a beautiful person who has been the most important thing is that the company.
07-12-2017T19:46:05,Bgrmystr2,"lol, turned him pretty demonic from what I recall"
07-12-2017T19:46:09,Dinoman515,XD
07-12-2017T19:46:15,PalmettoPathfinder1,"I have read the comic, yes, but what I was curious about would it possible for someone to do what a lich does and place their soul in a gem and then use black magic without having to worry about getting killed by the black magic."
07-12-2017T19:46:16,iZute,i do know twards the middle trace is was trying to find a way to make flora live longer
07-12-2017T19:46:17,Dinoman515,That eye tho.
07-12-2017T19:46:26,iZute,towards*
07-12-2017T19:46:26,CrRAR,^ That's what I'm sayin
07-12-2017T19:46:29,CrRAR,Plus maybe you could never finish saving someone yourself as you'd collapse before hand?
07-12-2017T19:46:35,Dinoman515,He still is!
07-12-2017T19:46:53,Dinoman515,"But, not as much."
07-12-2017T19:46:55,iZute,i know! but it was kinda put on hold for a little while XD
07-12-2017T19:47:12,Dinoman515,"Well duh, the baby names dude."
07-12-2017T19:47:28,CrRAR,So the answer is.... we just need MORE Traces to sacrifice!
07-12-2017T19:47:35,Bgrmystr2,"also, Dino your  statement about the most important thing or whatever.. completely unfinished thought, so.. wat."
07-12-2017T19:47:38,iZute,YEA lets try and guess names for traces and floras baby
07-12-2017T19:47:38,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-sadtrace2::ctwokinds-sadtrace2::ctwokinds-sadtrace2:
07-12-2017T19:47:49,CrRAR,Three should do it.
07-12-2017T19:47:56,Dinoman515,"Uh, theres only one."
07-12-2017T19:48:02,CrRAR,CLONIG!
07-12-2017T19:48:02,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Liches (for those who don't play D&D) are people who remove their soul from their body in order to gain immortality and then placed their soul inside a container for safe keeping.  However, while they are immortal, their bodies still decay over time"
07-12-2017T19:48:07,CrRAR,*CLONING!
07-12-2017T19:48:16,CrRAR,haha
07-12-2017T19:48:40,CrRAR,ahh
07-12-2017T19:48:43,Bgrmystr2,"Pretty sure that's not a thing, Palm. That requires people post-dead to be able to do things."
07-12-2017T19:48:55,Dinoman515,"HOLY SH!T DOOD, WHY THE MESSAGES BE SO LONGGGGG"
07-12-2017T19:49:00,iZute,"Wait guys i have a theory, one that mmight not be true be hear me out"
07-12-2017T19:49:04,Bgrmystr2,"and it seems like they can float around and act like people, but otherwise can't do much else."
07-12-2017T19:49:04,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Well, liches cheat death."
07-12-2017T19:49:09,Dinoman515,Otay..
07-12-2017T19:49:15,PalmettoPathfinder1,Sure go ahead iZute.
07-12-2017T19:49:23,Bgrmystr2,"yeah that's likely not a thing, Palm"
07-12-2017T19:49:29,iZute,its about floras child
07-12-2017T19:49:37,Dinoman515,OwO
07-12-2017T19:49:43,Dinoman515,Go on...
07-12-2017T19:49:57,PalmettoPathfinder1,"@Bgrmystr2, well, has Tom said anything about there not being any liches or undead in the TwoKinds universe?"
07-12-2017T19:50:08,PalmettoPathfinder1,I don't recall him saying anything like that.
07-12-2017T19:50:13,CrRAR,The masks are pretty freaky.
07-12-2017T19:50:25,CrRAR,Freaky deaky
07-12-2017T19:50:31,Dinoman515,Ephemural was wierd.
07-12-2017T19:50:34,iZute,you know how its stated how human and keidriens (not sure if i spelled that right) cant reproduce together right? then how did trace and flora have a child?
07-12-2017T19:50:39,Bgrmystr2,"It's pretty plainly explained in the story that cheating death is damn difficult, if not impossible"
07-12-2017T19:50:41,iZute,this is where my theory comes in
07-12-2017T19:50:51,CrRAR,IZute the mask did it.
07-12-2017T19:51:02,iZute,???
07-12-2017T19:51:18,Bgrmystr2,"Also explained in the story Zute, the mask changed that"
07-12-2017T19:51:19,iZute,the mask that possesed flora gave her a child?
07-12-2017T19:51:19,Bgrmystr2,xD
07-12-2017T19:51:26,CrRAR,"Tht one page Neutral is all like ""Some Keidran blood must survive!"""
07-12-2017T19:51:31,Bgrmystr2,no? They changed it so that Trace and Flora could have a child.
07-12-2017T19:51:38,CrRAR,It is the will of the GODS!
07-12-2017T19:51:38,Bgrmystr2,"exactly, Cr"
07-12-2017T19:51:46,Bgrmystr2,LITERALLY the will of the gods. XD
07-12-2017T19:51:47,Dinoman515,She did say that she had another race!
07-12-2017T19:52:04,CrRAR,also... this means the Keidran are gonna.. umm...
07-12-2017T19:52:04,PalmettoPathfinder1,@Bgrmystr2 this is what I meant by a lich:
07-12-2017T19:52:05,PalmettoPathfinder1,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lich_(Dungeons_%26_Dragons)#Ecology
07-12-2017T19:52:08,CrRAR,*POOF*
07-12-2017T19:52:19,iZute,WHAT?! how?! did i not read that part like what?!
07-12-2017T19:52:23,CrRAR,Even Flora.
07-12-2017T19:52:24,Bgrmystr2,"Palm, Twokinds is not D&D. xD"
07-12-2017T19:52:37,Bgrmystr2,"They have similarities, but they are not the same thing."
07-12-2017T19:52:40,CrRAR,...or maybe not if our Heroes can intervene!
07-12-2017T19:52:47,CrRAR,We don't know yet.
07-12-2017T19:52:48,Bgrmystr2,You won't find everything in D&D in Twokinds as well.
07-12-2017T19:52:53,CrRAR,lol
07-12-2017T19:53:16,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Well, you can tell there are some D&D influences and inspirations. But yes, I know it's different.  Still, Tom hasn't said yes or no about their being undead necromancers in the TwoKinds universe."
07-12-2017T19:53:21,iZute,would that make their child a keidruman?
07-12-2017T19:53:33,iZute,brb
07-12-2017T19:53:46,CrRAR,I think Keith can totally use his triple jump with Maddie/Lynn to jump into the Cosmos and murder AT LEAST one of the masks.
07-12-2017T19:53:57,CrRAR,I mean coooome on.
07-12-2017T19:53:58,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Of course, you do make a good point that if someone was able to achieve Lichdom in the TK universe, it would make that person on par with almost the masks themselves."
07-12-2017T19:54:00,CrRAR,He's KEITH
07-12-2017T19:54:25,PalmettoPathfinder1,Or even almost as powerful as Nora herself.
07-12-2017T19:55:05,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Especially, since there are dracoliches (dragon liches) to worry about.  Oh great, I got Forgotten Realms into TK!"
07-12-2017T19:55:26,PalmettoPathfinder1,Next time we'll have the heroes run into a certain dark elven ranger with a heart of gold!
07-12-2017T19:56:16,PalmettoPathfinder1,"But yeah Bgr, it's just a theory of mine.  It might 100% wrong, but who knows.  I'm sure Tom will tell us today or something."
07-12-2017T19:56:34,PalmettoPathfinder1,"But you do make several good points, ones that I totally agree with."
07-12-2017T19:58:09,Bgrmystr2,@iZute the page you're looking for is this one http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/206/
07-12-2017T19:58:11,CrRAR,I def think there's a bunch of hocus-pocus yet to see concerning Trace/Nora/magick/masks.
07-12-2017T19:58:14,CrRAR,It's totally gonna get interesting.
07-12-2017T19:58:22,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Ninjaed me, Bgr!"
07-12-2017T19:58:29,Bgrmystr2,"Lol Palm, late"
07-12-2017T19:58:34,CrRAR,We've only seen like the tip of the iceberg.
07-12-2017T19:58:35,PalmettoPathfinder1,I was just about to post it.
07-12-2017T19:58:41,Bgrmystr2,"Also, you're looking for attachment points that aren't there in the comic man"
07-12-2017T19:58:43,PalmettoPathfinder1,But good job on finding it
07-12-2017T19:59:04,PalmettoPathfinder1,"yeah, that's true.  I'm also probably overthinking things too."
07-12-2017T20:00:07,Bgrmystr2,"you're not gonna find something that isn't likely to be there. The fact that it's so difficult to raise the dead as a living being, and the fact that the dead, as ghosts, don't really have much way to do anything anyway"
07-12-2017T20:00:17,Bgrmystr2,it's just unlikely what you're looking for is even a thing
07-12-2017T20:00:20,Bgrmystr2,not even considered.
07-12-2017T20:00:53,PalmettoPathfinder1,True.  I sometimes overthink things in terms of what might happen in a comic or TV show.
07-12-2017T20:01:32,PalmettoPathfinder1,I was thrown totally for a loop when Pumayra betrayed the Thundercats and was revealed as Mumm-Ra's lover and spy!  (2011 version of Thundercats.
07-12-2017T20:01:57,PalmettoPathfinder1,That was a plot twist that I didn't see coming!
07-12-2017T20:02:08,PalmettoPathfinder1,Still sad that they cancelled the show.
07-12-2017T20:02:28,Dinoman515,Jesus Zute! That took forever for me to find! https://goo.gl/images/JiP3h1
07-12-2017T20:02:54,Bgrmystr2,Dino.. I already linked the page on the comic above earlier. &gt;.&gt;

07-12-2017T20:03:07,Dinoman515,O_O
07-12-2017T20:03:19,Bgrmystr2,"didn't even look at it, didja?"
07-12-2017T20:03:27,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-unimpressed:
07-12-2017T20:03:42,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Also, apparently people are comparing the Basitins with orcs and dwarves and the Keidran with elves."
07-12-2017T20:03:45,Dinoman515,I'm killing myself.... :ptv-whiny: it took me so long to find...
07-12-2017T20:03:55,Dinoman515,Why...
07-12-2017T20:04:04,Bgrmystr2,"Next time just use this, dude http://2ks.wogcodex.com/"
07-12-2017T20:04:09,Dinoman515,&gt;~&lt;
07-12-2017T20:04:12,Bgrmystr2,to search the page
07-12-2017T20:04:33,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Well, there are some good similarities between them if you think about it."
07-12-2017T20:04:40,Dinoman515,"Damn, i used google!"
07-12-2017T20:04:54,Bgrmystr2,I didn't bother. Google's rather useless sometimes
07-12-2017T20:05:38,Bgrmystr2,"also, Just went to google"
07-12-2017T20:05:43,Bgrmystr2,and just found it using google
07-12-2017T20:06:14,MidnightBlue78,"yeah, cuz google xD"
07-12-2017T20:06:22,Bgrmystr2,"all I did was search ""Twokinds keidran blood"" and the third link was the twokinds wiki"
07-12-2017T20:06:24,CrRAR,google google google
07-12-2017T20:06:35,Bgrmystr2,and the wiki has a link to the page of the webcomic
07-12-2017T20:06:40,Bgrmystr2,so..
07-12-2017T20:06:45,Bgrmystr2,"your google-fu is weak, sir."
07-12-2017T20:06:52,Bgrmystr2,You should work on it.

07-12-2017T20:11:08,MidnightBlue78,hey Blue
07-12-2017T20:11:09,CrRAR,Yo Blue!
07-12-2017T20:11:46,BluePhantom90,Well I caved and put something else in the sketch idea. T-T really wanted that Pillow Fort part2
07-12-2017T20:12:57,BadFoMo,@BluePhantom90 What did you request?
07-12-2017T20:13:24,BluePhantom90,The Sword in the Stone one
07-12-2017T20:14:00,BluePhantom90,Instead of Adelaide pulling the sword out she lifts the bolder with it. with a side pic with Maddie moving the sword.
07-12-2017T20:14:43,PalmettoPathfinder1,lol!
07-12-2017T20:16:56,BluePhantom90,I mean She might not be the chosen one. BUT who would argue with Adelaide able to lift the bolder with it.... I don't think anyone would challenge her to be king
07-12-2017T20:18:50,PalmettoPathfinder1,Good point.
07-12-2017T20:18:58,iZute,k im back just got some take out

07-12-2017T20:19:46,BluePhantom90,Oh talking about my sketch idea
07-12-2017T20:19:53,iZute,ah
07-12-2017T20:20:14,BadFoMo,"@BluePhantom90 That reminds me of the Excalibur Uber-Loot from Evil Genius. Your minions couldn’t pull the sword from the stone, so they just steal the stone with the sword in it."
07-12-2017T20:20:57,BluePhantom90,lol yeah well Just imagine Adelaide using that sword as a Mega hammer lol
07-12-2017T20:21:32,PalmettoPathfinder1,I do remember someone requested Natani and Adelaide dressedd up as the Sorceress and Amazon from the Dragon's Crown game.
07-12-2017T20:21:40,Dinoman515,Hubba Hubba

07-12-2017T22:22:14,Nekonny,"Unfortunately I made a miscalculation, and this new MB feels like it has 4 less USB ports than my last"
07-12-2017T22:22:25,CrRAR,aww
07-12-2017T22:22:29,Nekonny,that could prove to be a problem
07-12-2017T22:22:39,microbuss,MB?
07-12-2017T22:22:43,Panko,You could get a USB hub or a PCI USB card
07-12-2017T22:22:44,CrRAR,motherboard
07-12-2017T22:22:49,funnyman42,You can get a fancy device that turns 1 USB port into many.
07-12-2017T22:22:50,Panko,That would add some more USB ports
07-12-2017T22:22:51,microbuss,ah ok duuuh

07-12-2017T22:23:25,ZizzoGaming,He just said he has a MacBook. You can't install a PCI with more USBS
07-12-2017T22:23:34,ZizzoGaming,He needs a USB hub
07-12-2017T22:23:45,Nekonny,I have a pc

07-12-2017T22:39:56,Bgrmystr2,"Zute, the way I see it.. is if they think ANY less of you just cuz you like anthro art, then they're NOT worth your friendship."
07-12-2017T22:40:04,SageSaga,we can help you with art- we cant help you with your sociological problems
07-12-2017T22:40:05,funnyman42,True
07-12-2017T22:40:22,Dinoman515,Exactly what i was trying to say!
07-12-2017T22:40:22,neropan,how furry we talking
07-12-2017T22:40:23,iZute,thats what i thought sorry
07-12-2017T22:40:32,funnyman42,"BUT, if you don't think you can find other friends IRL&lt; it may be worth keeping it a secret."
07-12-2017T22:40:36,MidnightBlue78,i mind my business :ctwokinds-kingtea:
07-12-2017T22:40:51,Bgrmystr2,That's not how friendships should work funnyman
07-12-2017T22:40:58,Mihari,Friends aren't really friends if they cant' accept you for how you really are.
07-12-2017T22:41:00,funnyman42,It's better than being alone.
07-12-2017T22:41:02,SageSaga,"its easy for us to say ""Yeah its fine dont worry about it"" and not realize your situation and circumstances"
07-12-2017T22:41:03,Bgrmystr2,"exactly, Mihari"
07-12-2017T22:41:03,CrRAR,mmm
07-12-2017T22:41:08,w0lfmare,Liking anthro stuff isn't a big deal to begin with
07-12-2017T22:41:15,Bgrmystr2,I agree w0lf
07-12-2017T22:41:24,Tharkis,"man, chat in here flies so fast i cant read anything and follow any conversations"

07-12-2017T22:41:37,SageSaga,and if we give you advice and you take it and it turns out you live in a very uncivilized backwards town and you end up in a hospital- weeeeeelllll
07-12-2017T22:41:40,Bgrmystr2,Truth marv xD
07-12-2017T22:41:46,TheBeckoner,Im ok not having anyone know soooo idk
07-12-2017T22:42:11,iZute,but they are starting to catch on and its been a pain hiding for so long
07-12-2017T22:42:34,Dinoman515,It would probably be good to tell them unless they are like what Sage was getting at. :P
07-12-2017T22:43:12,Dinoman515,Because stress is not a good thing.
07-12-2017T22:43:36,iZute,by best friend would be the most accepting
07-12-2017T22:43:39,SageSaga,it would be best if we didnt get involved and you spoke to a single person you trust rather than a bunch of strangers on the internet
07-12-2017T22:43:52,Dadrobit,Get your friends into it. Give them a gateway furry with some catgirls and work them down the ladder until they down on your level.
07-12-2017T22:43:56,iZute,but i honestly trust you guys more
07-12-2017T22:44:02,Dadrobit,they're

07-12-2017T23:13:51,CrRAR,np
07-12-2017T23:14:03,CrRAR,Might want to hire Natani nxt time.
07-12-2017T23:14:10,Nekonny,has to be a compatibility issue
07-12-2017T23:14:22,TheBeckoner,no thanks gun is painless
07-12-2017T23:14:22,SageSaga,with what?
07-12-2017T23:14:30,CrRAR,Did you do all the windows updates?
07-12-2017T23:14:36,Nekonny,no idea
07-12-2017T23:14:45,CrRAR,I know some early ones fix compat problems
07-12-2017T23:14:49,BadFoMo,"Wait, her dress has an opening for a tail. Does the collor change cloths too, or did she have to get Non-Human cloths?"
07-12-2017T23:14:51,NightServant,what is doing wrong?
07-12-2017T23:15:09,Nekonny,YYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS :ptv-angry::ptv-angry:
07-12-2017T23:15:10,Ordithus,She could have borrowed Rose's clothing
07-12-2017T23:15:10,Panko,"Nekonny, if you're using Windows 10, sometimes SAI wants to have ""Windows 8 Compatibility Mode"" turned on."
07-12-2017T23:15:21,Nekonny,^that was it
07-12-2017T23:15:24,Panko,ahh
07-12-2017T23:15:29,CrRAR,what was it?
07-12-2017T23:15:46,Mihari,"Still not sure why you don't just use Clip, but whatever."
07-12-2017T23:16:02,w0lfmare,We're rooting for ya nekonny XD
07-12-2017T23:16:08,SageSaga,im not
07-12-2017T23:16:11,NightServant,Same.
07-12-2017T23:16:11,FoxxTrotter,^_^
07-12-2017T23:16:13,SageSaga,he shouldnt be using Sai
07-12-2017T23:16:21,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I shall root in sage's place
07-12-2017T23:16:21,Mihari,Probably not even a legal copy XD
07-12-2017T23:16:26,unsteddyphoenix,:O
07-12-2017T23:16:26,Nekonny,Everyone should be using photoshop
07-12-2017T23:16:32,CrRAR,TRU
07-12-2017T23:16:36,SageSaga,not true
07-12-2017T23:16:37,Nekonny,:ptv-uneasy:
07-12-2017T23:16:39,CrRAR,k
07-12-2017T23:16:44,w0lfmare,Clip is king
07-12-2017T23:16:48,ZizzoGaming,Then why aren't you Ron?
07-12-2017T23:16:51,Mihari,"Technically Photoshop is for photo manipulation, illustrator was for illustation and designs :P"
07-12-2017T23:16:52,SageSaga,Photoshop is expensive and you cant even really buy it anymore- you have to subscribe
07-12-2017T23:16:54,Panko,Mario Paint :^)
07-12-2017T23:17:05,CrRAR,yeah sub models suck
07-12-2017T23:17:08,NightServant,Even Chalo who was the staunchest SAI user I watched switched to Clip
07-12-2017T23:17:16,SageSaga,mario paint is for swatting flys
07-12-2017T23:17:19,Nekonny,"I have CS6, and it is legit"
07-12-2017T23:17:21,NightServant,after Matymaty convinced him.
07-12-2017T23:17:40,Nekonny,I cant seem to adapt to it
07-12-2017T23:17:49,w0lfmare,CHALO used Sai???
07-12-2017T23:17:51,SageSaga,because you wont try
07-12-2017T23:18:00,Dinoman515,"Howdy, im back."
07-12-2017T23:18:04,unsteddyphoenix,How different can it be? :thinking:
07-12-2017T23:18:05,CrRAR,hi
07-12-2017T23:18:22,iZute,maybe tom should do a drawng challenge where he draws a certien pic with a tabet then he draws the same one but with a mouse &gt; : )
07-12-2017T23:18:25,SageSaga,every difference is a mountain to Ron
07-12-2017T23:18:26,NightServant,Chalo used SAI and PHotoshop on his streams for the longest time. But lately he only streams using Clip
07-12-2017T23:18:32,Nekonny,it's pretty bad
07-12-2017T23:18:42,Nekonny,those mountins
07-12-2017T23:18:53,TheBeckoner,lol Zute I wanna see that
07-12-2017T23:19:01,iZute,XD
07-12-2017T23:19:03,Nekonny,those mountains
07-12-2017T23:19:28,neropan,japang
07-12-2017T23:19:31,Dinoman515,@CrRAR WAZZZZAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPP
07-12-2017T23:19:37,unsteddyphoenix,You have a lot of experience with drawing and mountain-shaped things though
07-12-2017T23:19:44,CrRAR,nm
07-12-2017T23:19:46,BluePhantom90,heh do like this
07-12-2017T23:19:51,NightServant,My problem with SAI is that you can tell right away when something was drawn on it
07-12-2017T23:19:59,unsteddyphoenix,Nero did you upload that ~saucy picture~
07-12-2017T23:20:00,NightServant,it looks... less professional than Clip
07-12-2017T23:20:15,Nekonny,Not at all
07-12-2017T23:20:20,NightServant,Very sketchy
07-12-2017T23:20:22,CrRAR,such a cute sketch
07-12-2017T23:20:23,Nekonny,thats not true at all
07-12-2017T23:20:32,NightServant,Sorry that's my opinion :P
07-12-2017T23:20:33,Dinoman515,Indeed
07-12-2017T23:20:36,ZizzoGaming,What kind of ~saucy~ are we talkin' here?
07-12-2017T23:20:46,CrRAR,the sauciest
07-12-2017T23:20:52,CrRAR,saucy
07-12-2017T23:20:53,TheBeckoner,link?
07-12-2017T23:20:54,HeresyArtStream,Hi everyone! o/
07-12-2017T23:20:57,w0lfmare,I'd call Sai the opposite of sketchy. The super clean lines are why everyone loves it so much
07-12-2017T23:20:58,TheBeckoner,heelo
07-12-2017T23:21:00,CrRAR,XD
07-12-2017T23:21:02,neropan,nope but i can send ya
07-12-2017T23:21:04,FoxxTrotter,"Hey, Heresy."
07-12-2017T23:21:24,unsteddyphoenix,Ayy¬ make it so number one
07-12-2017T23:21:28,unsteddyphoenix,"(I mean,  yes please)"
07-12-2017T23:21:29,Nekonny,"Ok, next issue... wacom key bindings"
07-12-2017T23:21:32,NightServant,"wolfmare. Clip can do lines much, much cleaner"
07-12-2017T23:21:40,Nekonny,sighs
07-12-2017T23:21:44,NightServant,Because you can draw using vectors
07-12-2017T23:21:47,w0lfmare,And why everyone who uses Sai eventually upgrades to Clip XD
07-12-2017T23:21:57,Panko,"I'm going to have to do a clean install of Windows sometime soon, I feel your pain x_x"
07-12-2017T23:22:00,Dinoman515,Man's not hot.
07-12-2017T23:22:06,Nekonny,why would you want to draw with vectors
07-12-2017T23:22:08,iZute,Raw sauce
07-12-2017T23:22:17,w0lfmare,"Ew, vectors"
07-12-2017T23:22:19,TheBeckoner,cook the sauce then
07-12-2017T23:22:23,Nekonny,unless you were doing graphic design work
07-12-2017T23:22:26,NightServant,"Vectors, many more tools, more layer options."
07-12-2017T23:22:28,FoxxTrotter,I've only seen Mora use vectors so far.
07-12-2017T23:22:34,iZute,2 + 2 = 4 - 1 = 3 QUICK MATHS
07-12-2017T23:22:40,NightServant,There is something called vector layer
07-12-2017T23:22:44,TheBeckoner,lol wat
07-12-2017T23:22:55,Nekonny,but why though
07-12-2017T23:22:56,Bgrmystr2,"wait, why would you not not vectors? Sheer quality and ability to work with shapes, not pixels"
07-12-2017T23:23:10,w0lfmare,Vectors hate my style of drawing
07-12-2017T23:23:14,Dinoman515,..?
07-12-2017T23:23:20,SageSaga,Ron
07-12-2017T23:23:24,NightServant,"no artifacts, and you can resize/deform without loss of quality?"
07-12-2017T23:23:25,SageSaga,seriously
07-12-2017T23:23:28,Nekonny,that seems like a lot more fork for a lot of added limitation
07-12-2017T23:23:36,w0lfmare,I do a lot of short strokes to make a long line
07-12-2017T23:23:38,CrRAR,hehe
07-12-2017T23:23:44,NightServant,I think you have never used a vector layer :P
07-12-2017T23:23:50,Nekonny,no textures
07-12-2017T23:23:52,Nekonny,gradients
07-12-2017T23:23:52,SageSaga,Ron- all my lines are vectors
07-12-2017T23:23:53,w0lfmare,I have...
07-12-2017T23:23:56,MarvTheHugPharaoh,brb
07-12-2017T23:24:04,SageSaga,and you can do all that with vectors too
07-12-2017T23:24:08,SageSaga,ya dingus
07-12-2017T23:24:09,NightServant,yes
07-12-2017T23:24:14,NightServant,you can do it
07-12-2017T23:24:20,Nekonny,eyou can try to emulate it sure
07-12-2017T23:24:26,SageSaga,omg
07-12-2017T23:24:28,Nekonny,doesnt even come close and takes a lot more work
07-12-2017T23:24:31,Mihari,"Honestly I think doing comics in vectors would be the way to go, especially if you wanted to easy scale for print."
07-12-2017T23:24:39,TheBeckoner,I have no idea what anyone is referring to lol
07-12-2017T23:24:48,ZizzoGaming,^
07-12-2017T23:24:50,NightServant,But with your style of work vector layers would be great
07-12-2017T23:24:54,Nekonny,the res we qork with is already high enough for that
07-12-2017T23:25:04,NightServant,your furred characters don't even have fur texture
07-12-2017T23:25:06,TheBeckoner,im just hopelessly trying to use krita
07-12-2017T23:25:06,iZute,vectors is points and lines instead of pixels right?
07-12-2017T23:25:07,Davoerlo,Afternoon all
07-12-2017T23:25:10,Mihari,"For somethings, yes."
07-12-2017T23:25:13,NightServant,why would you care so much for that?
07-12-2017T23:25:15,FoxxTrotter,"Hey, Davo."
07-12-2017T23:25:16,neropan,hungry
07-12-2017T23:25:33,SageSaga,seriously ron you arent even making real arguments here
07-12-2017T23:25:36,neropan,5 min break for cookies
07-12-2017T23:25:44,unsteddyphoenix,Niiiice¬
07-12-2017T23:25:46,unsteddyphoenix,Get those cookies
07-12-2017T23:25:47,Ordithus,:cookie:
07-12-2017T23:25:48,iZute,solid argument
07-12-2017T23:25:52,FoxxTrotter,:cookie::cookie::cookie:
07-12-2017T23:25:54,iZute,tasty
07-12-2017T23:25:56,Nekonny,The work fulfills it's purpose; just because you can draw on a canvas in 1200dpi doenst mean there is a point to doing that
07-12-2017T23:26:09,Nekonny,an exageration of course
07-12-2017T23:26:15,Nekonny,but still
07-12-2017T23:26:21,NightServant,that's such a terrible comparison :P
07-12-2017T23:26:22,TheBeckoner,Doin great Tom. I haven't forgotten about you lol
07-12-2017T23:26:25,unsteddyphoenix,Wait what the hell
07-12-2017T23:26:33,CrRAR,wut?
07-12-2017T23:26:44,TheBeckoner,who waht
07-12-2017T23:26:45,unsteddyphoenix,My keyboard has somehow swapped some buttons around
07-12-2017T23:26:47,SageSaga,Ron. Modern Vectors are basically your standard lines- with more options
07-12-2017T23:26:52,CrRAR,oh lord
07-12-2017T23:27:00,SageSaga,its not like ye' olden times
07-12-2017T23:27:00,unsteddyphoenix,"@ and "" are switched what??"
07-12-2017T23:27:07,CrRAR,like physically?
07-12-2017T23:27:12,Nekonny,you are talking about just the linework sage
07-12-2017T23:27:13,CrimsonHelsing,"Whew, back. What'd I miss?"
07-12-2017T23:27:14,Ordithus,that's an odd swap
07-12-2017T23:27:14,CrRAR,or keymap?
07-12-2017T23:27:15,Nekonny,right?
07-12-2017T23:27:17,unsteddyphoenix,Keymap
07-12-2017T23:27:27,unsteddyphoenix,How has this happened
07-12-2017T23:27:27,CrRAR,wow
07-12-2017T23:27:32,SageSaga,yes because you dont color in vectors
07-12-2017T23:27:42,Dinoman515,":( I wish I could support Tom more than I already am, but I just dont have the money..."
07-12-2017T23:27:53,TheBeckoner,^

07-12-2017T23:28:07,Nekonny,sure
07-12-2017T23:28:09,SageSaga,texture work and shading can be scaled properly with vectors
07-12-2017T23:28:13,CrRAR,purge the demonz

07-12-2017T23:28:22,CrRAR,lol
07-12-2017T23:28:25,unsteddyphoenix,Big sorry accidentally entered
07-12-2017T23:28:26,SageSaga,no one is saying you need to color with vectors
07-12-2017T23:28:34,SageSaga,it doesnt even let you do that in clip
07-12-2017T23:28:39,Nekonny,thats what I thought they were implying
07-12-2017T23:28:49,SageSaga,thats why your argument makes no sense- no one colors in vectors!
07-12-2017T23:28:54,CrRAR,is it built in to a laptop or a external?
07-12-2017T23:29:12,TheBeckoner,I think they were talking about key binding
07-12-2017T23:29:15,TheBeckoner,s*
07-12-2017T23:29:19,SageSaga,if you want to color or texture your vector lines- you can!
07-12-2017T23:29:20,TheBeckoner,idk tho
07-12-2017T23:29:22,unsteddyphoenix,"This is my desktop, so external."

07-12-2017T23:30:49,Bgrmystr2,"Phoenix, you probably have your keyboard switched to  a separate country setting"
07-12-2017T23:30:51,TheBeckoner,they need appreciation too
