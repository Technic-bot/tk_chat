17-11-2017T02:18:50,FenceEqualizer,Hiya Kei
17-11-2017T02:18:56,LannAF,Is discord still being funky?
17-11-2017T02:19:12,LannAF,"If you suddenly get spammed with several duplicate messages, sorry Sage."
17-11-2017T02:19:15,Keilani5747,Not nearly as bad as before nah.
17-11-2017T02:19:21,SageSaga,np
17-11-2017T02:19:24,LannAF,Sometimes when discord is being screwy it'll duplicate messages CONSTANTLY.
17-11-2017T02:19:37,Bgrmystr2,really
17-11-2017T02:19:40,Bgrmystr2,never had that before
17-11-2017T02:19:43,Bgrmystr2,it just doesn't send them
17-11-2017T02:19:45,LannAF,"Yeah, it's strange."
17-11-2017T02:19:50,Serpentfrog,Really
17-11-2017T02:19:53,Serpentfrog,Really
17-11-2017T02:19:56,Serpentfrog,Really
17-11-2017T02:19:59,LannAF,"I once accidently sent ""GODDAMNIT AUTODI"" to my friend during it"
17-11-2017T02:20:01,Bgrmystr2,serp no pls
17-11-2017T02:20:03,LannAF,and it repeated like 12 times.
17-11-2017T02:20:06,LannAF,She was not amused.
17-11-2017T02:20:13,LannAF,"Wait no, she was VERY amused"
17-11-2017T02:20:27,LannAF,Because I was frantically trying to delete them all as they spammed.
17-11-2017T02:20:51,Serpentfrog,It's fantastic when it dupes a ping.
17-11-2017T02:20:56,Keilani5747,I love it when Discord duplicates my typos.
17-11-2017T02:21:02,LannAF,Bahaha
17-11-2017T02:21:06,MarvTheHugPharaoh,so does Frog
17-11-2017T02:21:13,LannAF,Antagonizing you in just the right way
17-11-2017T02:21:20,Bgrmystr2,the only thing better
17-11-2017T02:21:50,Bgrmystr2,"would be if discord lagged in such a way that it sent a message, then accidently reverted any changes to the original message because of lag"
17-11-2017T02:22:20,Bgrmystr2,"There will be no fixed messages 'round these parts, partner."
17-11-2017T02:22:22,Keilani5747,"And you know I love it when people complain to me about pings, I am so patient lul"
17-11-2017T02:22:40,Bgrmystr2,so difficult to turn pings off lol
17-11-2017T02:23:40,LannAF,My only complaint is when people go to community servers and suddenly use @everyone LITERALLY to just say hi
17-11-2017T02:23:42,LannAF,Or other things
17-11-2017T02:23:52,Keilani5747,And so much worse to supress @everyone in settings
17-11-2017T02:24:00,LannAF,"It causes people to mute those pings, and when you're an admin, it kinda sucks."
17-11-2017T02:24:15,LannAF,Because @everyone is useful for important announcements
17-11-2017T02:24:34,LannAF,So I naturally tend to try to limit people's usage of it so everyone doesn't mute it
17-11-2017T02:24:41,SageSaga,they need to make an option for the servers to let you make it so @everyone only works when used by an admin or mod
17-11-2017T02:24:46,SageSaga,brb
17-11-2017T02:24:54,Serpentfrog,They already do.
17-11-2017T02:24:56,LannAF,It's SUPPOSED to work like that if you restrict it to admins
17-11-2017T02:24:57,ZRO4825,"Tis an option, actually, yup."
17-11-2017T02:24:59,aeoronwah,^
17-11-2017T02:25:03,LannAF,But from what I've seen it doesn't work
17-11-2017T02:25:13,Keilani5747,Oh it does from what I know.
17-11-2017T02:25:14,ZRO4825,It does on our server.
17-11-2017T02:25:15,LannAF,Maybe it was just being buggy
17-11-2017T02:25:17,LannAF,Hm.
17-11-2017T02:25:24,LannAF,Yeah our members could still ping everyone
17-11-2017T02:25:31,LannAF,Maybe something just got fucky
17-11-2017T02:25:36,Serpentfrog,Check the permissions.
17-11-2017T02:25:37,ZRO4825,Always possible
17-11-2017T02:25:44,LannAF,"Yeah, the owner did"
17-11-2017T02:25:58,Twokinds,brb
17-11-2017T02:26:00,LannAF,Members had restricted access and admins were the only ones permitted to use @everyone and @here
17-11-2017T02:26:01,Keilani5747,Have you tried turning it off and back on again?
17-11-2017T02:26:08,LannAF,Aw crap I forgot to do that
17-11-2017T02:26:16,LannAF,I'm such a dunce
17-11-2017T02:26:31,LannAF,In reality we put like 5% effort into fixing it

17-11-2017T02:28:22,ZRO4825,RIGHT? @.@
17-11-2017T02:28:35,LannAF,I just realized

17-11-2017T02:28:46,LannAF,I've never thought about there being fandom discords

17-11-2017T02:29:12,LannAF,Pings?
17-11-2017T02:29:17,LannAF,Or just message notifications
17-11-2017T02:29:19,Keilani5747,The intensity of my apathy makes me not care about complaints.
17-11-2017T02:29:21,MarvTheHugPharaoh,by looking in the channel

17-11-2017T02:30:07,LannAF,Like the name of the channel becomes white and flips the marker on the server right?

17-11-2017T03:02:14,Bgrmystr2,and it's much more likely that something else would have killed you before that.

17-11-2017T03:39:51,Bgrmystr2,A lot of that was brought over even when the internet became a thing and more people got interested in their culture and the things they make
17-11-2017T03:39:52,HeresyArtStream,By default the Playstations are very good Blu-ray players because they're so popular that they're the industry standard.
17-11-2017T03:40:19,HeresyArtStream,If you are putting out a Blu-Ray movie you gotta make sure it works on PS3 and PS4.

17-11-2017T03:44:50,CrimsonHelsing,mama tiger butt x3
17-11-2017T03:44:54,Bgrmystr2,I haven't needed a CD drive for my pc other than to install OSes since... oh god.. 2006? maybe 2004?
17-11-2017T03:45:23,HeresyArtStream,I use mine mostly to watch movies and burn games for my old game consoles.
17-11-2017T03:45:43,HeresyArtStream,"I could make some MP3 CDs for my car if I wanted, though..."
17-11-2017T03:45:52,Bgrmystr2,I don't know any consoles that don't have write-protected cds o.O
17-11-2017T03:46:07,HeresyArtStream,Dreamcast
17-11-2017T03:46:09,HeresyArtStream,Sega CD
17-11-2017T03:46:14,Bgrmystr2,"ooh ok, those"
17-11-2017T03:46:22,HeresyArtStream,Turbo CD / PC Engine CD
17-11-2017T03:46:28,Keilani5747,"Mmm sleep, that sounds nice. As long as it's a flat surface I can sleep."
17-11-2017T03:46:41,HeresyArtStream,(I still need to get a Turbo Duo / PC Engine Duo)
17-11-2017T03:46:54,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"A tree for my bed, pls"
17-11-2017T03:46:55,HeresyArtStream,My Gamecube is also modded to read DVD-Rs
17-11-2017T03:47:19,Keilani5747,I have even sucessfully slept on hardwood flooring.
17-11-2017T03:47:25,HeresyArtStream,"Still have a few consoles that need modding though, particularly my Xbox and Sega Saturn."
17-11-2017T03:47:33,Bgrmystr2,had the SNES and went straight to windows 95 I believe
17-11-2017T03:47:50,Bgrmystr2,never did get big on consoles
17-11-2017T03:48:32,HeresyArtStream,"I am a retro game collector. I think I have somewhere around 200 or so carts and discs, probably more."
17-11-2017T03:48:43,HeresyArtStream,Probably closer to 300 now.
17-11-2017T03:48:54,SageSaga,problem is -if i start thinking about getting a Playstation-
17-11-2017T03:49:07,SageSaga,i'll end up getting a PS4 Pro and get Monster Hunter
17-11-2017T03:49:30,HeresyArtStream,I would say hold off on the PS4 Pro a little longer. It's about due for a price drop.
17-11-2017T03:49:47,HeresyArtStream,The rumor is that Sony is coming out with a new PS4 model next year to replace the Pro with.
17-11-2017T03:49:59,ZRO4825,"You make me sad, Heresy. I used to be around that range on restro stuff ;_;"
17-11-2017T03:50:11,MarvTheHugPharaoh,or another mid gen PlayStation will come out in like a year
17-11-2017T03:50:14,FenceEqualizer,Goood Goood. Let the Palico guide you.
17-11-2017T03:50:34,HeresyArtStream,I don't know if the specs will be any better but the rumor mill is that it will at least have a UHD Blu-Ray drive built-in.
17-11-2017T03:50:49,Bgrmystr2,"I wonder if the OS I had when I first got a computer was actually 95, or if it was the one beforehand :thinking:"
17-11-2017T03:50:59,Bgrmystr2,I'm not quite sure
17-11-2017T03:51:07,HeresyArtStream,My first computer was a Commodore 64 that my mom had since before I was born.
17-11-2017T03:51:08,SageSaga,while im a bit of a Monster Hunter fanatic- im TRYING to wait for the PC release
17-11-2017T03:51:11,ZRO4825,"Windows 3.1, lol"
17-11-2017T03:51:16,SageSaga,but its probably not going to be soon T_T
17-11-2017T03:51:21,ZRO4825,"Also, Commodore 64 &lt;3"
17-11-2017T03:51:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"I too am waiting for pc, MH"
17-11-2017T03:51:32,HeresyArtStream,"I never learned to program for the C64, but I knew LOAD ""*"",8,1 and that's all I needed. :V"
17-11-2017T03:51:37,SageSaga,meanwhile i will be seeing a ton of videos of people playing it on PS4 soon
17-11-2017T03:51:50,ZRO4825,YUP! love that load command &lt;3 lmao
17-11-2017T03:52:16,Bgrmystr2,"might not have been 3.1, zro. My dad came out of the navy and started his own store, so he had more access to all the workstation software"
17-11-2017T03:52:22,FenceEqualizer,I hope PC and Ps4 are compatible.
17-11-2017T03:52:31,SageSaga,wat?
17-11-2017T03:52:47,HeresyArtStream,Cross compatability between games is more likely if it's only on PC and PS4.
17-11-2017T03:52:55,MarvTheHugPharaoh,you mean cross platform multiplayer? Fence
17-11-2017T03:53:02,FenceEqualizer,There you go. The word escaped me.
17-11-2017T03:53:09,SageSaga,they already confirmed- no Crossplay
17-11-2017T03:53:13,FenceEqualizer,sfjaklsjflkasj
17-11-2017T03:53:16,HeresyArtStream,"Sony is in the same position Microsoft was in most of last gen, and the market leader usually isn't interested in cross-compatability with their competetors."
17-11-2017T03:53:16,Bgrmystr2,RIP
17-11-2017T03:53:17,MarvTheHugPharaoh,thats up to the developers of the game
17-11-2017T03:53:22,HeresyArtStream,Sadly that's just the way it usually goes.
17-11-2017T03:53:26,Serpentfrog,When will they make Pyre:tm: multiplayer?
17-11-2017T03:53:36,FenceEqualizer,Argggh. That's the only thing I don't like. The community will get split.
17-11-2017T03:53:38,HeresyArtStream,If you're not the market leader you have more to gain from cooperating with your competitors.
17-11-2017T03:53:38,Twokinds,I'd like that
17-11-2017T03:53:43,Bgrmystr2,the community is already split
17-11-2017T03:53:49,Bgrmystr2,and the companies want it to stay that way
17-11-2017T03:53:50,FenceEqualizer,exactly
17-11-2017T03:53:52,Bgrmystr2,so the wars continue
17-11-2017T03:53:56,Bgrmystr2,so they get more money if they win
17-11-2017T03:54:03,Serpentfrog,"I call the imps, Tom."
17-11-2017T03:54:26,HeresyArtStream,I am still waiting for an American release of PSO2. It will probably be written on my grave.
17-11-2017T03:54:32,FenceEqualizer,Oh well. Guess i'll be getting MH on PC and PS4
17-11-2017T03:54:37,Bgrmystr2,"That last panel is gold, tom :ptv-laugh:"
17-11-2017T03:54:39,SageSaga,I would think if there was going to be any crossplay it would be Xbox/PC
17-11-2017T03:54:46,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Bgr, Phil Spencer the head of X-box, he hate the fanboy wars"
17-11-2017T03:54:46,HeresyArtStream,"""Here lies Heresy: He died waiting for PSO2."""
17-11-2017T03:54:55,Twokinds,"Okay, that's gunna be it for me tonight."

17-11-2017T04:02:41,ZRO4825,Depends. Is Serpentfrog an invertebrate?
17-11-2017T04:02:44,Bgrmystr2,Everyone is sleeping
17-11-2017T04:02:49,Bgrmystr2,generally
17-11-2017T04:02:53,Serpentfrog,Let me ask you this: was that comment removed?
17-11-2017T04:02:56,Bgrmystr2,"everyone else is a vampire, eobot"
17-11-2017T04:02:57,ZRO4825,Never trust invertebrates. They lack substance....

17-11-2017T04:05:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"is ""albeit"" a word?"
17-11-2017T04:05:29,Serpentfrog,Yes.
