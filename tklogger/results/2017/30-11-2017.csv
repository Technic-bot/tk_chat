30-11-2017T20:40:46,Dadrobit,Maddie is not the spy she's definitely there in Edinmere with ream A. He was already on the docks http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/852/ while Maddie is seen descending the next page.

30-11-2017T20:42:10,funnyman42,:T
30-11-2017T20:42:19,funnyman42,How is that evidence?
30-11-2017T20:42:20,Serpentfrog,Fun fact: arm wraps are very hard to take off. /s
30-11-2017T20:43:14,Bgrmystr2,he doesn't take off that arm wrap even when in disguise.
30-11-2017T20:43:26,Serpentfrog,That we know of.
30-11-2017T20:43:34,Bgrmystr2,so he'd be wearing it if he was actually disguised as Maddie.
30-11-2017T20:43:38,Dadrobit,"Also, dunno where musclehead general falls into that theory? I mean, it's 100% confirmed to be the spy."
30-11-2017T20:43:44,Bgrmystr2,But Maddie doesn't have any arm wraps
30-11-2017T20:43:58,CrRAR,"Everytime we've seen him, yeah, he's had arm wraps. Even as the Basitin in the inn that one time."
