24-12-2017T19:10:10,CrRAR,uh huh~
24-12-2017T19:12:24,DevlNuK,"I'm with my old notebook, my pc went to repair. I bought a new processor"
24-12-2017T19:13:53,CrRAR,"ohh nice, the new ones are pretty sweet, it's a good generation to buy into."
24-12-2017T19:14:36,CrRAR,I was eyeing getting a 8th gen Intel at some point.
24-12-2017T19:16:21,DevlNuK,I was with I3 7100 but I found a promotion and upgraded to an I5
24-12-2017T19:18:22,CrRAR,"ohh, clutch upgrade. The i5s are so worth it. Extra snappy."
24-12-2017T19:19:29,DevlNuK,"My PC is not there and these things 1050ti, 8gb ram and now i5"
24-12-2017T19:20:01,CrRAR,nice
24-12-2017T19:22:03,DevlNuK,And your pc like it is Cr?
24-12-2017T19:26:44,CrRAR,"My builds are a bit older, I have two machines, one's running a i7 4770k the other a i7 4790k 16/32GB RAM.... kinda old gfx though, just a 780. Haha"
24-12-2017T19:27:28,DevlNuK,Wow cool!
24-12-2017T19:28:11,CrRAR,"Yeah, gotta rebuild at some point. Time really files."

24-12-2017T20:14:15,RandomTKLover,I have no clue what your talking about
24-12-2017T20:14:44,RandomTKLover,"I get the ram part, but I donâ€™t follow computers much"

24-12-2017T21:13:30,Bgrmystr2,I'm running a way slower pc than you are and it runs like a dream
24-12-2017T21:13:58,Bgrmystr2,"so unless you're heavy on the rendering or whatnot, I'm just not seeing a reason for you to upgrade from what you have"
24-12-2017T21:14:01,Bgrmystr2,it's wasted power.
24-12-2017T21:14:08,Bgrmystr2,and wasted money
