16-12-2017T00:00:40,TheBeckoner,I like both but something in between would look the best Imo
16-12-2017T01:04:14,Bgrmystr2,oh nvm my dumbass browser reversed them
16-12-2017T01:04:19,Bgrmystr2,the 2nd one looked better
16-12-2017T01:04:49,Bgrmystr2,"for the overall eye structure, anyway"
16-12-2017T01:04:49,TheBeckoner,If I had to pick one Id go with the second too
16-12-2017T01:05:56,Bgrmystr2,"the iris on the gx link looks good for the left eye, but not so much for the right"
16-12-2017T01:06:03,Bgrmystr2,"nice round shape, honestly"
16-12-2017T01:06:08,Bgrmystr2,the right eye isn't.
16-12-2017T01:06:30,Bgrmystr2,and the other image doesn't have em either
16-12-2017T01:06:46,Bgrmystr2,but the rest of the eye looks way better
16-12-2017T01:06:52,Bgrmystr2,the outline shape and such
16-12-2017T02:31:18,TheBeckoner,Good night fellow lurkers

16-12-2017T12:37:09,MidnightBlue78,"they hate each other and fight and argue as soon as they see each other, its gotten really bad"
16-12-2017T12:37:21,RandomTKLover,The comic might not be so good for the younger one
16-12-2017T12:37:29,MidnightBlue78,they cant be together
16-12-2017T12:37:41,Devlfry,buy minecraft for them XDDDDDDDDDDD
16-12-2017T12:37:46,MidnightBlue78,i dont know if they'll like the comic

16-12-2017T12:41:47,MidnightBlue78,i'll figure something out

16-12-2017T12:49:53,Devlfry,But food for me. It's already good xD
16-12-2017T12:49:53,MidnightBlue78,"it has potatoes, right?"
16-12-2017T12:50:04,Devlfry,Yes potatoes
16-12-2017T12:50:20,MidnightBlue78,looks good though....i'm making breakfast too :)
16-12-2017T12:50:31,RandomTKLover,That’s what the fries are
16-12-2017T12:51:49,Devlfry,wha?
16-12-2017T12:52:45,MidnightBlue78,"yeah, sorrty i didnt catch the ""fries"" part when i read it"
16-12-2017T12:52:54,MidnightBlue78,*sorry
16-12-2017T12:53:04,RandomTKLover,It’s cool
16-12-2017T12:54:18,RandomTKLover,I need to train myself to be less of an asshole. I’m always pointing out other peoples mistakes.
16-12-2017T12:54:30,RandomTKLover,Kind of like serp.
16-12-2017T12:54:42,Devlfry,"And so you cut the potatoes into cubes and then fry,  then beat 2 eggs and mix the potatoes in beaten eggs, and put everything in the frying pan"
16-12-2017T12:55:23,Devlfry,ready to eat
16-12-2017T12:55:25,MidnightBlue78,"no Random, it's ok"
16-12-2017T12:56:01,MidnightBlue78,"Devl, that reminds of spanish omelet"
16-12-2017T12:56:33,Devlfry,"Random Relax, man, you're not like Serp, be yourself."
16-12-2017T12:57:02,Devlfry,And a modification of it : P
16-12-2017T12:58:51,RandomTKLover,I need to stop it because I’m always puting people down in public too.
16-12-2017T12:59:18,RandomTKLover,It gets people (and myself) so mad
16-12-2017T13:00:29,Devlfry,"if I speak as a ""Brazilian"" even I would be up I would be 200% worse than Serp"
16-12-2017T13:00:43,RandomTKLover,XD
16-12-2017T13:01:30,Devlfry,Brazilian and very arrogant
16-12-2017T13:01:56,Devlfry,{as vezes}
16-12-2017T13:02:21,MidnightBlue78,brazilians are considered arrogants?
16-12-2017T13:03:13,Devlfry,yep
16-12-2017T13:03:30,RandomTKLover,"One time I put a girl down for being bad at drawing, when I can’t draw for my life. If that isn’t arrogant, then I don’t know what is."
16-12-2017T13:04:03,RandomTKLover,"Unless I got the meaning wrong, then I’m just an asshole."
16-12-2017T13:06:12,Devlfry,And what do you think of my drawing? http://prntscr.com/hoqam7
16-12-2017T13:08:29,RandomTKLover,I wish I could draw like that
16-12-2017T13:09:00,MidnightBlue78,very good Devl
16-12-2017T13:09:09,Devlfry,even though I think I know the basics of drawing I do not keep talking about what others do not know how to draw because there are several types of drawings.
16-12-2017T13:13:42,Devlfry,"Drawing is not 100% a characteristic of a person, you can try to learn but that is not why you will feel sad because a person said they do not know how to draw! Keep positive thinking that one hour you will be able to"
16-12-2017T13:14:56,MidnightBlue78,"yes, everyone's style is different, there is no right or wrong way to draw i guess"
16-12-2017T13:15:17,MidnightBlue78,"but I'm no artist,so..."
16-12-2017T13:15:58,MidnightBlue78,"i like to encourage people to keep doing what they love, eventually people become better the more they practice"
16-12-2017T13:16:32,Devlfry,"I know what a person is talking about, that you're terrible and you better stop. My dad always said my pathetic designs, but that's not why I stopped trying to improve my drawings"

16-12-2017T17:12:22,unsteddyphoenix,nat is
16-12-2017T17:12:24,Xexanoth,"nah, it's nat"
16-12-2017T17:12:24,Combak,Or Nat. Which is more likely?
16-12-2017T17:12:30,Glassan,Maybe they both will.

16-12-2017T17:12:30,ProsePro7,Nat
16-12-2017T17:12:42,MarvTheHugPharaoh,flipping each other off is what siblings do
16-12-2017T17:13:13,MviluUatusun,Okay.  I'm back.  I had to start a load of clothes and prepare my dinner.
16-12-2017T17:13:14,djikoz,"i have the impression Natani is thinking ""i would kill you if you weren't that cute"""
16-12-2017T17:13:18,Kamaro12,marv: can attest :P
16-12-2017T17:13:27,FenceEqualizer,"That's how we say ""Love you bro/sis"""

16-12-2017T17:13:55,MviluUatusun,"Neon, didn't Keith make a comment about Natani's ineptitude as an assassin?  LOL."
16-12-2017T17:14:05,unsteddyphoenix,"Natani and killing, pick one"
16-12-2017T17:14:09,Wyvern088,is it a bad time to mention we've never actually seen Natani win a fight?
16-12-2017T17:14:22,Aquaninja101,her ineptitude is why they are in this situation in the first place
16-12-2017T17:14:25,ProsePro7,"""Watch it or else your back on the list""  Was her response"
16-12-2017T17:14:30,Foxpie,funny thing is if me or my older borther flip each other off its like in dragonn ball z where its just there and we still chatting
16-12-2017T17:14:38,Foxpie,like so how was your day then
16-12-2017T17:14:38,FenceEqualizer,Natani being top tier assassin off screen. They work better when not being watched.
16-12-2017T17:14:39,MviluUatusun,"Prose, yup.  LOL."
16-12-2017T17:14:40,djikoz,well Natani is an assassin but not a good one
16-12-2017T17:14:49,Mustanglvr007,True
16-12-2017T17:14:53,Wyvern088,bad assassins tend to die
16-12-2017T17:15:03,unsteddyphoenix,Or get saved by their targets
16-12-2017T17:15:04,MviluUatusun,"Like a ninja, Fence?"
16-12-2017T17:15:05,unsteddyphoenix,One of the two

16-12-2017T17:29:24,unsteddyphoenix,still counts

16-12-2017T17:30:37,MviluUatusun,I would guess it all depends on the angle of her foot from her toes to her ankle.
16-12-2017T17:30:38,Wyvern088,"Im 6'0""?"
16-12-2017T17:30:41,ZahnHolley,nyaah :3

16-12-2017T17:34:23,ProsePro7,I'm guessing that this is all happening at the estate
16-12-2017T17:34:33,Erroneous,in Zens body
16-12-2017T17:35:14,unsteddyphoenix,Thats a bit abstract

16-12-2017T19:06:59,unsteddyphoenix,I suppose it makes more sense next to Rose
16-12-2017T19:07:02,Vexd,She just kinda defaults back to it
16-12-2017T19:07:06,WereKeidran,most of the Raine sketches end up with her in wolf form

16-12-2017T19:07:38,unsteddyphoenix,A lot of people miss some pretty key stuff when they read.
16-12-2017T19:07:43,w0lfmare,Makes her look more like Euchre's daughter
16-12-2017T19:07:55,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah, exact;y"
16-12-2017T19:08:22,Kamaro12,maybe. I think it'd be more interesting if she was in her human form
16-12-2017T19:08:25,WereKeidran,Isn't Rose more of Raine's 2nd cousin? Rose and Euchre were cousins right or am i remembering wrong?
16-12-2017T19:08:29,Mustanglvr007,Yeah
16-12-2017T19:08:32,BadFoMo,@goldgardian I think that's why I say 'Human Raine' in my request.

16-12-2017T19:21:04,BadFoMo,Maybe she's with Euchre?
16-12-2017T19:21:20,Sarandiel,Didn't she and Raine get attacked and separated so Raine could get away? Or was that before the Neutral fight?

16-12-2017T20:22:52,CrRAR,He's just preserved them forever in solid mana
16-12-2017T20:23:03,Sarandiel,There can be an assassin general. Maddie's not a knight either

16-12-2017T22:34:27,CrRAR,I think it's good for mental pliability!

16-12-2017T23:00:26,MidnightBlue78,*fingers crossed*
16-12-2017T23:00:42,Dadrobit,Honestly don't know what I'll do if my Seasonal Suggestion doesn't get picked.
16-12-2017T23:00:48,MviluUatusun,"Well, bedtime.  I'll see everyone next time.  Y'all take care"

16-12-2017T23:01:25,Dadrobit,"Honestly really really want to see it, but I never got my last one done either."
16-12-2017T23:01:32,Dadrobit,o/ Buddy
16-12-2017T23:01:56,FenceEqualizer,I already plan to turn my christmas party suggestion into a new years one
16-12-2017T23:02:32,Dadrobit,"King Adelaide bringing Zen and Natani as cubs to give their Christmas wish-list to ""Santa""."
16-12-2017T23:02:54,Ordithus,d'awww
16-12-2017T23:03:06,FenceEqualizer,ooo that's a good one
16-12-2017T23:03:26,Dadrobit,"My other one is Alaric and Maddie sparring/fencing, but Alaric is getting frustrated as Maddie is impossible to hit."
16-12-2017T23:04:35,Dadrobit,"Don't wanna give up on the Christmas one, but I also don't want to keep doing it until July rolls around either."
16-12-2017T23:04:56,Dadrobit,Such ismy luck
16-12-2017T23:04:57,FenceEqualizer,Well if you don't mind missing the holiday I would say throw it out every other vote
16-12-2017T23:05:02,Dadrobit,is my*
16-12-2017T23:06:49,Dadrobit,"Constancy is key imo. These voting masses are fickle and not altogether intelligent, I wouldn't want to confuse them by switching things up so often."
16-12-2017T23:08:38,FenceEqualizer,low key savage.
16-12-2017T23:09:13,Dadrobit,"Jeez, if that's what you consider low key, I'd hate to see what you consider tactless."
16-12-2017T23:09:35,FenceEqualizer,Walking up to someone face and going F*** you
16-12-2017T23:10:14,CrRAR,lol
16-12-2017T23:10:36,CrRAR,*nataniflipoff.jpg*
16-12-2017T23:11:00,FenceEqualizer,Though you have a point about the fickleness.
16-12-2017T23:13:38,Dadrobit,"Brb, gonna go make a slice of toast."
16-12-2017T23:13:40,Ordithus,Today's stream had an unusually high number of clothed characters.
16-12-2017T23:13:44,Ordithus,Only Kat was nude.
16-12-2017T23:15:02,FenceEqualizer,I know *sniff* I'm so proud.
16-12-2017T23:15:54,ClockworkTDC,XD

16-12-2017T23:23:36,CrRAR,Haha
16-12-2017T23:24:27,CrRAR,He'll finally shed a tear.
16-12-2017T23:25:38,Dadrobit,"Hey, Kat. Got a haircut?"
16-12-2017T23:25:46,Dadrobit,-Eric probably
16-12-2017T23:27:17,unsteddyphoenix,too real
16-12-2017T23:27:38,FenceEqualizer,Kat: Oh...yeah...thank you for noticing...:ctwokinds-LauraCry:
16-12-2017T23:27:38,CrRAR,What kinda toast ya bring back?
16-12-2017T23:27:42,CrRAR,"(say cinnamon sugar, say cinnamon sugar)"
16-12-2017T23:27:46,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-maddiessparkles:
16-12-2017T23:28:06,FenceEqualizer,I feel bad for laughing at the idea.
16-12-2017T23:28:29,Ordithus,"""Looks good, sis"""
16-12-2017T23:28:50,CrRAR,"Haha, she'd probably then proceed to strangle him with said clothing."
16-12-2017T23:29:03,Ordithus,Platonically strangle
16-12-2017T23:29:12,unsteddyphoenix,hahhaha
16-12-2017T23:29:27,CrRAR,Importantest qualifier there
16-12-2017T23:29:32,CrRAR,XD
16-12-2017T23:29:42,Ordithus,After reading Raine
16-12-2017T23:29:50,Ordithus,"'s fics, I think it's needed"
16-12-2017T23:30:16,CrRAR,Yeh
16-12-2017T23:32:18,Dadrobit,"Oh, no, simple Rye with a little butter and Peach Preserves"
16-12-2017T23:32:36,Dadrobit,I thought you were talking for Eric and I was very confused lol.
16-12-2017T23:32:52,CrRAR,Oh nice.
16-12-2017T23:32:55,Ordithus,lol
16-12-2017T23:33:32,CrRAR,Yeah I've gravitated toward toast recently for a cold weather snack. XD
16-12-2017T23:33:40,Dadrobit,"Considered making a salami sandwich, but I didn't want to over-eat."
16-12-2017T23:33:59,Dadrobit,"""cold weather"" what's that?"
16-12-2017T23:34:13,Ordithus,"My life, robit."
16-12-2017T23:34:17,Dadrobit,People are legit still swimming at the public pool out here man.
16-12-2017T23:34:30,CrRAR,What we have up here in the dark north.
16-12-2017T23:34:39,CrRAR,Haha
16-12-2017T23:34:59,CrRAR,But yeah I've become addicted to pumpernickel for some reason.
16-12-2017T23:35:02,Dadrobit,Though the big water parks did shut down for the most part in August.
16-12-2017T23:35:26,CrRAR,Back to school~
16-12-2017T23:35:27,Dadrobit,Because it can be delicious?
16-12-2017T23:35:39,CrRAR,Yis
16-12-2017T23:36:02,Dadrobit,I didn't go this past summer :(
16-12-2017T23:36:12,Dadrobit,"Wanted to, but never got around to it."
16-12-2017T23:36:56,Dadrobit,"I pass by one on my way to class every day, and it just sits there, taunting me...."
16-12-2017T23:37:33,Ordithus,"Similar, here.  I""m only a few miles from a nice sandy beach.  I never went this summer."
16-12-2017T23:37:46,Ordithus,In a month I can probably walk on the water instead.
16-12-2017T23:38:52,Dadrobit,"I did hit up the river a few times this summer, but natural stuff like that and beaches are kinda sketchy sometimes with glass shards lurking."
16-12-2017T23:39:35,Ordithus,"""Hence, pumpernickel means ""devil's fart"", a definition accepted by the publisher Random House"" - Wikipedia"
16-12-2017T23:39:54,CrRAR,:|
16-12-2017T23:40:35,CrRAR,"I'll be calling it ""Dark Rye"" then HENCEFORTH"

16-12-2017T23:47:50,CrRAR,Like clockwork
16-12-2017T23:48:01,Dadrobit,"Have to kick her out if I get a gig though, she complains too loudly if she's not being held sometimes."
16-12-2017T23:48:20,Ordithus,Cute.
16-12-2017T23:49:20,CrRAR,"Yeah, cat's do crave attention and warmth. Their lifeblood."
16-12-2017T23:49:23,Dadrobit,I need to tack on a bit of carpet to my door. It's getting too scrathced...
16-12-2017T23:50:06,Dadrobit,BF1 was super good though. No complaints here.
16-12-2017T23:52:28,Dadrobit,"Brb again, gonna go put away dishes."
