18-11-2017T16:22:34,Twokinds,How do you mean?
18-11-2017T16:22:43,unsteddyphoenix,Kat also taught raine to cook
18-11-2017T16:22:51,Rrolf,For me the first association with Natani is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TilQ8BIHisw
18-11-2017T16:22:52,unsteddyphoenix,...with debatable success
18-11-2017T16:22:58,ThingsAreMoving,Kat showed Rose how to care for the manor

18-11-2017T16:23:09,Rrolf,... damn I'm old.
18-11-2017T16:23:11,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Zen should teach Raine how to use a bow
18-11-2017T16:23:24,TheUniverse,Keith is already the translator for the group so it seems it would make sense for Keith to teach Natani english
18-11-2017T16:23:29,Kamaro12,Tom: like putting suggestions about the same character together in one poll
18-11-2017T16:23:33,WereKeidran,I thought Natani was the archer of the pair
18-11-2017T16:23:38,Kamaro12,"dunno how much work that would entail, granted"
18-11-2017T16:23:56,TheGamakazi,Keith should teach Natani how to kill someone :ptv-uneasy:
18-11-2017T16:23:56,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I think Zen tought Nat a fair bit of what he nows
18-11-2017T16:24:00,unsteddyphoenix,If there's a bunch of one type he could do that
18-11-2017T16:24:11,unsteddyphoenix,"Like all the transform ones in one poll, if there's a lot"
18-11-2017T16:24:12,NeonMitsumi,@TheGamakazi He might as well teach Zen then.

18-11-2017T16:24:29,Kamaro12,just read for character names and categorize them based on who is mentioned

18-11-2017T19:02:04,MarshallMelon,"Uh oh, looks like the stream didn't save"
18-11-2017T19:02:05,unsteddyphoenix,Hopefully rest is all you need
18-11-2017T19:02:06,Zebranky,"Don't screw up your hands, we need those. Take care, dude."
18-11-2017T19:02:06,MidnightBlue78,"Tom, you need some pbysical therapy for that hand"
18-11-2017T19:02:08,Xexanoth,Stream is Ded

18-11-2017T19:02:21,CrimsonHelsing,"Ayy xP understood Tom, we'll see you in the next stream, hope that hand heals up soon xP"
18-11-2017T19:02:23,FenceEqualizer,You may want to take a longer break tom. Don't want to F up your hand.
18-11-2017T19:02:27,BadFoMo,@MarshallMelon It didn't?!
18-11-2017T19:02:33,MarshallMelon,Notification isn't there
18-11-2017T19:02:36,Xexanoth,Put you hand in a Tiny Bed and tuck it in for a good rest :)
18-11-2017T19:02:38,ThingsAreMoving,yup
18-11-2017T19:02:48,CrRAR,sometimes it takes a second
18-11-2017T19:02:53,BadFoMo,MarshallMelon
18-11-2017T19:02:55,TorqueEmUp,Dangit. Just realized I am gonna have to try and watch the continuation of the stream tomorrow at work.
18-11-2017T19:02:55,LeKnightWolf,if healing is required then take such action
18-11-2017T19:03:00,TorqueEmUp,oh well
18-11-2017T19:03:00,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I think it might be time for some Hot Cocoa
18-11-2017T19:03:09,Bgrmystr2,it usually takes a bit before it states whether it saved
18-11-2017T19:03:16,FenceEqualizer,Just pour the hot cocoa on your hand.
18-11-2017T19:03:20,TorqueEmUp,Feel better Tom
18-11-2017T19:03:22,MarshallMelon,Seems longer than usual
18-11-2017T19:03:23,BadFoMo,"@MarshallMelon Well, if the one bot didn't get it, I did."
18-11-2017T19:03:28,CrRAR,Isn't warmth better for therapy?
18-11-2017T19:03:32,ThingsAreMoving,"Alright, gonna use the spare time to catch some Zzzz's"

18-11-2017T19:03:46,CrRAR,Ice is good for swelling n injury
18-11-2017T19:03:49,FenceEqualizer,Night things.
18-11-2017T19:03:51,MarshallMelon,"Yeah, not the first time you've had to bail the Youtube guy out, huh FoMo?"
18-11-2017T19:03:57,TorqueEmUp,Cold just reduces swelling
18-11-2017T19:04:00,CrRAR,Tom you need a lil hand jacuzzi
18-11-2017T19:04:02,NeonMitsumi,There's the recording
18-11-2017T19:04:09,CrRAR,see
18-11-2017T19:04:10,MarshallMelon,"Ah, I've been bamboozled"
18-11-2017T19:04:12,MviluUatusun,I guess Tom's finished for the night?
18-11-2017T19:04:12,CrRAR,told ya
18-11-2017T19:04:15,NeonMitsumi,Git gud

18-11-2017T19:04:21,BadFoMo,@MarshallMelon I've only had to do it twice.
18-11-2017T19:04:23,MidnightBlue78,sends Tom some serious healing
18-11-2017T19:04:28,TorqueEmUp,"Indeed, Tom's hand be all messed up"
18-11-2017T19:04:41,Xexanoth,quick someone cast Curaga
18-11-2017T19:04:44,MviluUatusun,"Well, I'm sorry I missed most of it.  I had to work on my stories before I shower and go to bed."
18-11-2017T19:04:48,MarshallMelon,"So we've got the current sketch, a Tom pick, and then how many more in the next one?"
18-11-2017T19:05:03,MarshallMelon,3?
18-11-2017T19:05:07,Xexanoth,"that was the third sketch, so 4 more"
18-11-2017T19:05:09,MviluUatusun,I'm sorry to hear about Tom's hand.  What's wrong with it?
18-11-2017T19:05:19,CrRAR,overworked hand
18-11-2017T19:05:19,Xexanoth,He drew to much
18-11-2017T19:05:21,MarvTheHugPharaoh,over worked it on the comic pages
18-11-2017T19:05:24,MidnightBlue78,pain and cramping
18-11-2017T19:05:27,MviluUatusun,"Oh, I can understand."
18-11-2017T19:05:35,Bgrmystr2,The recording showed up in the list before it actually announced on the notification window.
18-11-2017T19:05:42,FenceEqualizer,Hands rebelling.
18-11-2017T19:05:45,NeonMitsumi,"Oh, well. Good night everyone, have a nice rest of the night. Tom, take care of your hand! If needed, feel free to completely skip this weeks stream. Take care! &lt;3"
18-11-2017T19:05:45,Bgrmystr2,Maybe you should give that a check
18-11-2017T19:05:51,Bgrmystr2,if the notification doesn't show up

18-11-2017T19:09:47,luna146,Yes we do. &gt;:)
18-11-2017T19:10:39,FenceEqualizer,We help places look more crowded then it really is.
18-11-2017T19:11:03,FenceEqualizer,Like wall flowers at a party.
18-11-2017T19:11:17,Mitternachtfox,I back what did i miss
18-11-2017T19:11:23,MarshallMelon,Everything
18-11-2017T19:11:26,MarshallMelon,For real this time
18-11-2017T19:11:28,Xexanoth,stream dead
18-11-2017T19:11:30,Mitternachtfox,Again crap
18-11-2017T19:11:51,Mitternachtfox,Wait streams dead?
18-11-2017T19:11:57,Xexanoth,"Tom overworked his Hand, so continue tommorow"
18-11-2017T19:11:58,FenceEqualizer,Yep.
18-11-2017T19:12:09,Mitternachtfox,What time tomorrow
18-11-2017T19:12:14,MarvTheHugPharaoh,4pm est
18-11-2017T19:12:23,Kryp7ic,strem ded?
18-11-2017T19:12:34,MarshallMelon,Nah it's just sleeping
18-11-2017T19:12:36,TorqueEmUp,Probably same time as today. which mean I will have to watch at work tomorrow. X_x
18-11-2017T19:12:38,Xexanoth,look above :)
18-11-2017T19:13:07,FenceEqualizer,Same.  Though hope he doesn't over work his hand
18-11-2017T19:13:17,MarshallMelon,Man I should've changed my username while I was AWOL. I haven't used MM in anything else for years
18-11-2017T19:13:33,MarshallMelon,"Only other one is my Reddit account, and I can't change that either"
18-11-2017T19:13:37,FenceEqualizer,Crap is not fun when it is stubborn to heal.
18-11-2017T19:14:17,MarshallMelon,Is it carpal or RSI?
18-11-2017T19:14:19,Mitternachtfox,Yea but its better to let it heal then hurt it more
18-11-2017T19:14:43,MarshallMelon,"RSI can go away by itself, but carpal's more serious"
18-11-2017T19:16:33,MarshallMelon,&gt;_&gt;
18-11-2017T19:16:34,MarshallMelon,&lt;_&lt;
18-11-2017T19:16:42,MarshallMelon,Man i'm great at killing chats
18-11-2017T19:16:47,MarvTheHugPharaoh,&gt;_&lt;
18-11-2017T19:17:06,Xexanoth,:ptv-SteelwormHades:
18-11-2017T19:17:10,Mitternachtfox,Nein das marv did
18-11-2017T19:17:17,PalmettoPathfinder1,Wow!  There's a new DLC for Titan's Quest!  Oh snap!  Regional styles for my character's clothes!  Sweet!
18-11-2017T19:17:21,Mitternachtfox,:ptv-SteelwormHades:
18-11-2017T19:17:31,MarshallMelon,I understood maybe 3 of those words
18-11-2017T19:17:31,Xexanoth,isn't Titan Quest like...10 years old?
18-11-2017T19:17:44,Xexanoth,and pretty much died half a year after release?
18-11-2017T19:17:51,Xexanoth,or am i thinking of a different game
18-11-2017T19:18:04,qwe304,i just finished making a gif/music vid
18-11-2017T19:18:13,qwe304,took me like 4 hours
18-11-2017T19:18:20,qwe304,for 1 minute
18-11-2017T19:18:24,Mitternachtfox,:ptv-excited:
18-11-2017T19:18:28,PalmettoPathfinder1,"@Xexanoth, well, yeah, which is the reason for my surprise."
18-11-2017T19:18:46,Xexanoth,"yep, just googled it myself"
18-11-2017T19:18:47,MarshallMelon,TF2's also celebrating its 10th anniversary
18-11-2017T19:18:53,Mitternachtfox,Im going to start replying with only emojis
18-11-2017T19:18:53,Xexanoth,dam
18-11-2017T19:18:57,PalmettoPathfinder1,Still it's nice for a game company to continue to provide support to its games even after a decade.
18-11-2017T19:19:02,MarshallMelon,But that never really left the public eye
18-11-2017T19:19:04,Xexanoth,"then again, the game was kinda weird, expecially the final boss"
18-11-2017T19:19:24,Zebranky,"Wow, that's a throwback. I went to a lecture from the lead designer on Titan Quest when I was in college."
18-11-2017T19:19:42,MarshallMelon,Meanwhile Ultima looks in wistfully from a window
18-11-2017T19:19:49,Dadrobit,"Okay, I'm back."
18-11-2017T19:19:53,MarvTheHugPharaoh,WB Dad
18-11-2017T19:20:04,Dadrobit,Aaaaand it would seem Tom need to break for his hand?
18-11-2017T19:20:10,Zebranky,And I look back wistfully at Ultima
18-11-2017T19:20:11,Xexanoth,"The best thing about Titan Quests it that you can throw it in the face of all the ""Piracy isn't bad"" people"
18-11-2017T19:20:11,MarvTheHugPharaoh,da
18-11-2017T19:20:14,Bgrmystr2,yeah Dadro
18-11-2017T19:20:20,DarthKeidran,Tom stop the stream? My app says it’s offline
18-11-2017T19:20:24,Xexanoth,same time tomorrow
18-11-2017T19:20:26,PalmettoPathfinder1,@Zebranky wow!  That's really cool.
18-11-2017T19:20:30,qwe304,tf2 has more daily players 10 years later than COD:IW did on launch day (pc)
18-11-2017T19:20:32,Xexanoth,@Darth and Dad
18-11-2017T19:20:44,Dadrobit,"Whelp, Tom, if you're still here, feel better mah dude."
18-11-2017T19:20:48,DarthKeidran,I see. How far did it get?
18-11-2017T19:20:55,MarshallMelon,Partly through sketch 3
18-11-2017T19:20:55,DarthKeidran,What sketches?
18-11-2017T19:21:05,qwe304,bout 60% through the third
18-11-2017T19:21:06,DarthKeidran,I saw teaching human
18-11-2017T19:21:14,Xexanoth,"Tiger Winter Fur, and NibNab2"
18-11-2017T19:21:16,DarthKeidran,And poof coats.
18-11-2017T19:21:17,qwe304,"i can get u 2nd, just a sec"
18-11-2017T19:21:27,Dadrobit,"Teaching Human, Winter Fluff, and Nib Nab part deux"
18-11-2017T19:21:43,qwe304,here darth https://imgur.com/a/urJ2O
18-11-2017T19:21:48,DarthKeidran,I can envision what bob nab 2 will look like
18-11-2017T19:22:03,Zebranky,"@PalmettoPathfinder1 Better was having a sit-down conversation with the designer of Loom, tbh. :)"
18-11-2017T19:22:21,DarthKeidran,Meant to say nib but autocorrect took over.
18-11-2017T19:22:38,DarthKeidran,And thanks @qwe304
18-11-2017T19:23:29,DarthKeidran,"Well, the advantage is I have more time to get my TwoKinds the last journey poster closer to completion."
18-11-2017T19:23:30,qwe304,"mhh, no matter how i save and open this gif, the sound is lost"
18-11-2017T19:24:32,Bgrmystr2,"because it's playing a video, not putting audio in the file itself."
18-11-2017T19:24:35,DarthKeidran,I can’t wait to finish it.
18-11-2017T19:24:43,Bgrmystr2,there's no audio in the file.
18-11-2017T19:24:46,qwe304,dang
18-11-2017T19:25:00,Bgrmystr2,you need to create a flash or something for that.
18-11-2017T19:25:18,DarthKeidran,"Flash, mp4, or mov"
18-11-2017T19:25:24,qwe304,wait i think i can download it as an mp4
18-11-2017T19:25:37,DarthKeidran,That should work.
18-11-2017T19:25:56,DarthKeidran,MP4 is a video format.
18-11-2017T19:26:01,BadFoMo,What's being downloaded?
18-11-2017T19:26:19,Xexanoth,everything
18-11-2017T19:26:48,BadFoMo,Which part of everything?
18-11-2017T19:26:56,Bgrmystr2,all parts of it
18-11-2017T19:27:01,Bgrmystr2,otherwise it's not everything now is it?
18-11-2017T19:27:07,Xexanoth,mostly the porn though
18-11-2017T19:27:16,BadFoMo,Ah.
18-11-2017T19:27:18,Bgrmystr2,that's the most important part of everything.
18-11-2017T19:27:19,qwe304,just a thing i made
18-11-2017T19:27:42,BadFoMo,Cool.
18-11-2017T19:27:59,DarthKeidran,I’m going to head out now so I can get more work done on my TK fan art project.
18-11-2017T19:28:18,qwe304,"dangit, still no audio"
18-11-2017T19:28:20,FenceEqualizer,Have a good night.
18-11-2017T19:28:21,MidnightBlue78,bye Darth
18-11-2017T19:28:27,MarvTheHugPharaoh,see ya Darth
18-11-2017T19:28:33,DarthKeidran,Night everyone!
18-11-2017T19:28:38,qwe304,guess ill have to use windows movie maker since its an mp4 now
18-11-2017T19:28:47,BadFoMo,What is it?
18-11-2017T19:29:11,qwe304,a thing i made
18-11-2017T19:29:15,Bgrmystr2,you didn't do that in the first place? O.O
18-11-2017T19:29:17,Dadrobit,Cya Darth
18-11-2017T19:30:00,qwe304,"i was trying to make it a gif, not knowing they didnt support audio by default"
18-11-2017T19:30:13,qwe304,luckily i was able to download it as an mp4
18-11-2017T19:31:14,BadFoMo,Maybe you could re-record it with BandiCam?
18-11-2017T19:32:06,BadFoMo,"Er, what all were you trying to do?"
18-11-2017T19:34:31,qwe304,i got it an an mp4
18-11-2017T19:34:44,qwe304,going to add the music in windows movie maker now
18-11-2017T19:35:15,Bgrmystr2,"pretty roundabout way to do it, but I guess if it works.. :thinking:"
18-11-2017T19:36:24,qwe304,it didnt add the music itself so ill have to do it
18-11-2017T19:36:27,Bgrmystr2,"You do know, though, that Windows Movie Maker supports image files, and you can use the original files instead of using the compressed gif you got from that site"
18-11-2017T19:36:44,Bgrmystr2,and then just add the music you want
18-11-2017T19:36:55,qwe304,its not ccompressed since i downloaded it as an mp4
18-11-2017T19:37:06,qwe304,least not as much
18-11-2017T19:37:08,Bgrmystr2,mp4 is not raw
18-11-2017T19:37:17,Bgrmystr2,"and that's irrelevant, because GIF is compression"
18-11-2017T19:37:17,qwe304,eh its good enough
18-11-2017T19:37:22,Bgrmystr2,and GIF to MP4 is more compression
18-11-2017T19:37:32,qwe304,its onlt 300x350 anyway
18-11-2017T19:37:51,qwe304,it wasnt gif-mp4 it was png-mp4
18-11-2017T19:38:10,Bgrmystr2,animated png to mp4 is still compression
18-11-2017T19:38:19,Bgrmystr2,it's a conversion
18-11-2017T19:38:30,Bgrmystr2,and it's not a raw conversion either
18-11-2017T19:38:33,qwe304,its good enough for me
18-11-2017T19:39:04,Bgrmystr2,maybe for future reference then..?
18-11-2017T19:39:11,qwe304,"the alternative is spending another hour or two remaking it, for a quality increase that may or may not be noticeable"
18-11-2017T19:39:26,qwe304,im not that fluent with movie maker anyway
18-11-2017T19:40:28,Bgrmystr2,Not even remotely an hour or two XD
