09-11-2017T01:21:53,unsteddyphoenix,"""Yeeeup. Hasnt been that much damage since the Chediski Rodeo of '98."""
09-11-2017T01:22:12,Dadrobit,2002
09-11-2017T01:22:27,Dadrobit,And it's the Rodeo-Chediski Fire
09-11-2017T01:22:30,unsteddyphoenix,"Oh btw, I had literally the most mundane dream where you won some sort of writing competition."
09-11-2017T01:22:35,Dadrobit,\o/
09-11-2017T01:22:45,unsteddyphoenix,So congrats!
09-11-2017T01:22:54,unsteddyphoenix,Put that on your resume too
09-11-2017T01:23:11,unsteddyphoenix,Chediski Rodeo sounds cooler.
09-11-2017T01:23:15,Dadrobit,"Unless Tom gets back to me on the side comic project, I don't think I'll be winning much in the way of writing contests."
09-11-2017T01:23:52,Dadrobit,"Well, that's cause you're on the opposite side of the planet, everything's backwards there"
09-11-2017T01:24:20,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-eyeroll:
09-11-2017T01:27:05,Dadrobit,"Huh, get this. One of the fires was started by a seasonal tribal firefighter looking to prove his stuff and get hired as a fast response firefighter for the Bureau of Indian Affairs."
09-11-2017T01:27:33,Dadrobit,"He set two fires, but only managed to put one out."
09-11-2017T01:27:45,Dadrobit,10 years in jail.
09-11-2017T01:28:10,unsteddyphoenix,tribal firefighter?
09-11-2017T01:29:20,Dadrobit,The other fire was set by a stranded motorist trying to signal a chopper. The White Mountain Apache Tribal Court as of 2014 fined her 57 million in restitution to the tribe.
09-11-2017T01:29:42,Dadrobit,And $1650 in civil penalties.
09-11-2017T01:30:04,unsteddyphoenix,57million lol
09-11-2017T01:30:31,Dadrobit,"Yeah, the Native American reservations are almost completely independent of Arizona"
09-11-2017T01:30:50,unsteddyphoenix,"by ""tribal"" firefighter you mean native american?"
09-11-2017T01:31:30,Dadrobit,"Taken verbatim from the wiki, but pretty much yeah."
09-11-2017T01:33:56,unsteddyphoenix,"The hell is the point of a 57million dollar fine, just throw her in jail too"
09-11-2017T01:37:17,Dadrobit,"I think it was to make a point, basically the tribe flexing as much as it can. She was initially not charged with arson by the US Attorney's Office. But that pissed off the local tribe a lot. So after pressuring for 7 more years, in 2009 another judge"
09-11-2017T01:38:05,Dadrobit,"ruled that she was eligible for trial in a civil case by the tribe. That finally ended in 2014. But it was a civil case, no jail time. Just a life time of debt."
09-11-2017T01:39:00,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
09-11-2017T01:39:14,unsteddyphoenix,"when youre in that much debt, it becomes to governments problem more than yours"
09-11-2017T01:44:44,Dadrobit,"Yeah, they're not gonna see pretty much any of it beyond the $1650."
09-11-2017T02:08:21,Dadrobit,Gonna go take more meds and see if I can't get some sleep tonight.
09-11-2017T02:08:28,Dadrobit,Have a good one guys.
09-11-2017T02:18:05,unsteddyphoenix,Bye~

09-11-2017T16:47:26,MidnightBlue78,Power outages are the worst
09-11-2017T16:47:53,MidnightBlue78,My family in PR is still without power more tgan a month after hurricane Maria
09-11-2017T16:48:03,Bgrmystr2,hoping it's all fixed and they don't need to do any more work on it ;&lt;

09-11-2017T16:51:20,Dadrobit,Like shit. Just got back from the doctor.
09-11-2017T16:52:07,Dadrobit,Really bad case of strep.
09-11-2017T16:52:13,MidnightBlue78,oh crap
09-11-2017T16:52:21,MidnightBlue78,sorry hun
09-11-2017T16:52:41,Dadrobit,"Doc went to take a swab, and when I opened my mouth to let her in she just said, ""Oh wow!"""
09-11-2017T16:52:51,Dadrobit,"So yeah, my throat's fucked atm."
09-11-2017T16:53:45,Dadrobit,"But whatever, I have my amoxicillin now, everything's gonna be peachy in a day or two."
09-11-2017T16:54:08,Dadrobit,"But thank you for asking, how're you doing yourself?"
09-11-2017T16:54:37,MidnightBlue78,"well, i struggled to get outta bed today"
09-11-2017T16:54:50,Dadrobit,:(
09-11-2017T16:54:56,MidnightBlue78,"not with pain or anything, just completely unmotivated"
09-11-2017T16:55:23,MidnightBlue78,"i'm takung medications, some days i feel better than others"
09-11-2017T16:55:33,Bgrmystr2,"wow dadro, hope you heal up soon :("
09-11-2017T16:56:07,Dadrobit,One day at a time man.
09-11-2017T16:56:59,MidnightBlue78,"yes, that's right, one day at a time"
09-11-2017T16:57:11,MidnightBlue78,:)
09-11-2017T16:57:41,Dadrobit,:)
09-11-2017T17:01:22,MidnightBlue78,"so now, just trying to do a few things around the house so i can watch tonight's stream"
09-11-2017T17:13:30,Twokinds,"Ever since a major power outage a few years a go, I keep ice packs in my freezer."
09-11-2017T17:14:01,Twokinds,If there's a power outtage food should last at least a day or two.
09-11-2017T17:17:49,MidnightBlue78,never hurts to be prepared
09-11-2017T17:18:16,TorqueEmUp,"Yeah, thought doesn't help in the winter when it knocks out your furnace, and have to stay at a hotel, or at a friend or relatives place so you don't freeze to death. :P"
09-11-2017T17:18:22,TorqueEmUp,Though*
09-11-2017T17:19:34,TorqueEmUp,"That happened to us one winter about 5 years ago or so, give or take."
09-11-2017T17:20:46,TorqueEmUp,"Took like 2-3 days to get the power back on at home. we're lucky we didn't have our water pipes burst with how much ass the electric company was dragging their ass, when the damned substation is almost literally in our backyard."
09-11-2017T17:20:53,MidnightBlue78,what really scares me about power outages is that they mess up your appliances
09-11-2017T17:21:05,MidnightBlue78,and appliances are not cheap
09-11-2017T17:22:00,TorqueEmUp,Those are usually surges that break stuff.
09-11-2017T17:22:43,TorqueEmUp,but sometimes a power outtage comes with those surges.
09-11-2017T17:24:16,TorqueEmUp,"Only thing that freaks me out, is I know I am going to jump out of my skin one day, because I have a power transformer sitting rightoutside my apartment window, it it looks friggin' old, and I know one day that thing is going to fail."
09-11-2017T17:25:07,TorqueEmUp,and those things sound like bombs going off.
09-11-2017T17:25:41,Bgrmystr2,"They don't always explode, that's just one thing out of many"
09-11-2017T17:30:42,TorqueEmUp,No but I've had at least 3-4 times where one has exploded and resulted in our power going out.
09-11-2017T17:30:50,TorqueEmUp,when I still lived at home
09-11-2017T17:34:32,Bgrmystr2,unlucky
09-11-2017T17:39:20,TorqueEmUp,"granted like I said, I had a substation like literally in my backyard, probably no more than 100 yards away"
09-11-2017T17:40:13,TorqueEmUp,probably more those big boys going than these cylindrical pole mounted ones.
09-11-2017T17:44:55,TorqueEmUp,"but still, this one outside my window is like 15 feet away. lol"
09-11-2017T17:58:20,TheGamePlayer,skimmed chat herd something about a pole... did you lick it and have your tong freeze?

09-11-2017T18:38:06,MidnightBlue78,"Well, that's kunda rude, saying something's dead when it's not"

09-11-2017T18:38:30,MidnightBlue78,"so, i'm with Tom on this one"
09-11-2017T18:39:49,Twokinds,It's just pointless. Sometimes people don't talk for a while.
09-11-2017T18:39:58,Twokinds,It's not necessary to point it out every time there's a lull.
09-11-2017T18:40:02,TheGamePlayer,ya im joking
09-11-2017T18:40:29,unsteddyphoenix,No~ everyone loves forced conversation~

09-11-2017T18:43:01,MidnightBlue78,I guess most people are just way too used to a chat moving 100miles per second

09-11-2017T19:52:21,Bgrmystr2,so none of that
09-11-2017T19:53:27,unsteddyphoenix,Next stream video game stream 'cause you said that
09-11-2017T19:53:36,Bgrmystr2,"Hey, I'll watch it"
09-11-2017T19:53:41,Bgrmystr2,and my statement stills tands
09-11-2017T19:53:59,Bgrmystr2,cuz every stream beforehand makes it accurate as-of time stated
09-11-2017T19:54:00,Bgrmystr2,:P
09-11-2017T19:54:20,qwe304,art is usually meanin nora cards or other stuff
09-11-2017T19:54:37,TheGamePlayer,i ment art as in what it says up there but not a comic strip nor sketch
09-11-2017T19:54:41,TheGamePlayer,just art
09-11-2017T19:54:57,MidnightBlue78,it would be actually interesting if Tom did a game stream
09-11-2017T19:55:14,TheGamePlayer,i do it but its very annoying
09-11-2017T19:55:28,Bgrmystr2,Were you here when Tom said he did the nora cards in a row earlyer this week?
09-11-2017T19:55:30,TheGamePlayer,my bitrate and delay are awful
09-11-2017T19:55:35,Bgrmystr2,"and showed them off on the stream, even"
09-11-2017T19:55:37,TheGamePlayer,well bitrate is fine
09-11-2017T19:55:56,Bgrmystr2,earlier* goddamn my fingers
09-11-2017T19:56:07,TheGamePlayer,but i need to delay it as far as it can go
09-11-2017T19:58:50,qwe304,which stream bgr..

09-11-2017T19:59:41,qwe304,"or at least the 2 he showed at the end, were there more?"
09-11-2017T20:00:13,Bgrmystr2,"If tom did all the Nora cards and the next voting incentive, then what else is there to do?"
09-11-2017T20:00:27,Bgrmystr2,"I think he did them already, or they aren't set up on patreon yet"
09-11-2017T20:01:08,MidnightBlue78,what exactly is the voting incentive?
09-11-2017T20:01:09,qwe304,ive only seen 2 nora cards
09-11-2017T20:01:18,qwe304,a mini comic
09-11-2017T20:01:42,Bgrmystr2,"when you go to the main page, you can see it on the left side"
09-11-2017T20:01:45,Bgrmystr2,just above the patreon link
09-11-2017T20:01:58,Bgrmystr2,and it's not always a mini-comic
09-11-2017T20:02:04,TheGamePlayer,".... sooo im at the airport before the brotherhood they said there was ""an army of ghouls"" i count 15 all dead and they said "" lots of men died taking this airport"" wow XD how weak are they"

09-11-2017T20:42:02,Bgrmystr2,it's called a web crawler
09-11-2017T20:42:03,MidnightBlue78,should i get myself some :ctwokinds-kingtea:?

09-11-2017T20:42:23,Bgrmystr2,and that's why it's not called a spider
09-11-2017T20:42:30,TheGamePlayer,XD
09-11-2017T20:42:48,Bgrmystr2,"also, it's because there's several types of impressively scary malware under the spider category"
09-11-2017T20:43:07,Bgrmystr2,so getting the two confused is a rather bad idea

09-11-2017T20:55:11,Twokinds,It's not you guys. It's not chatting like this.
09-11-2017T20:55:17,Dadrobit,"No shit though, you're really upset about this?"
09-11-2017T20:55:23,Dadrobit,ah
09-11-2017T20:55:29,unsteddyphoenix,"Its more a problem talking IRL, right?"
09-11-2017T20:55:41,MidnightBlue78,oh good
09-11-2017T20:55:55,Twokinds,"It's just being taked to, individually."

09-11-2017T20:56:27,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"I sometimes have to deal with people like that at work, thats were earbuds help out"
09-11-2017T20:56:29,MidnightBlue78,bc of that
09-11-2017T20:56:37,Bgrmystr2,I'm rather the opposite. I can deal with one on ones. I hate being in large groups of people irl. Especially when everyone turns their attention to you
09-11-2017T20:56:41,Bgrmystr2,"man, fuck some of that"
09-11-2017T20:56:48,MidnightBlue78,"i can't be around people, they drain me"
09-11-2017T20:56:53,unsteddyphoenix,Im definitely more comfortable in groups
09-11-2017T20:56:54,SpotTheLeopard,"Or talked -at- where you're not actually part of the conversation, just dumped on?"

09-11-2017T20:57:25,TheArtApprentice,Yep that's a typo I can't explain
09-11-2017T20:57:52,Twokinds,"Anyone, I'm gunna be a little late because someone wouldn't stop destracting me ALL DAY."
09-11-2017T20:58:04,Dadrobit,Fuckin' Mark...

09-11-2017T20:59:50,unsteddyphoenix,"It's fine, you shouldnt feel stressed about these streams at least."
09-11-2017T20:59:53,SpotTheLeopard,"... to the setting up late bit, not to the stroke o_o; poor timing on text reply"
09-11-2017T20:59:53,Bgrmystr2,"ikr Dadro. Take your time, tom, we'll wait. :)"

09-11-2017T21:09:32,Dadrobit,He facepalmed so hard...
09-11-2017T21:09:39,MarshallMelon,Oh hey I managed to preempt one of these things for once
09-11-2017T21:09:41,TheArtApprentice,GASP oh no my sickness is contagious via internet
09-11-2017T21:09:48,MidnightBlue78,makes you sick for real

09-11-2017T21:10:41,MarshallMelon,o7
09-11-2017T21:10:43,MarshallMelon,Hey all
09-11-2017T21:10:49,Bgrmystr2,heya Marshall
09-11-2017T21:11:13,BadFoMo,"I don't have the money for Nora Cards eather. Mostly due to my slowly turning into my 'friend' who is a ""Cheap *******"" and takes pride in that self given title."
09-11-2017T21:11:34,TheArtApprentice,?
09-11-2017T21:11:42,TheArtApprentice,Oh
09-11-2017T21:11:47,MarshallMelon,But if you're becoming more frugal surely that would mean more disposable income?
09-11-2017T21:11:51,MarshallMelon,Or did I misread that
09-11-2017T21:13:07,TheArtApprentice,Brb
09-11-2017T21:17:35,Bgrmystr2,"technically yes, Marshall"
09-11-2017T21:18:03,Bgrmystr2,but being frugal doesn't always equate to being cheap xD
09-11-2017T21:18:25,Bgrmystr2,"cuz I live with someone who's frugal, not cheap, and someone else who is cheap, and not frugal"
09-11-2017T21:18:31,Bgrmystr2,so.. there's a world of difference
09-11-2017T21:18:50,MarshallMelon,"Yeah, I guess so"
09-11-2017T21:19:56,BluePhantom90,You okay Tom?
09-11-2017T21:20:49,MarshallMelon,Yeah if you're feeling good you probably shouldn't be drawing
09-11-2017T21:20:55,MarshallMelon,*not feeling good
09-11-2017T21:21:04,Dadrobit,Cheap is only going to the movies when they hit the dollar theatre and always buying the cheapest meat at the grocery store. Frugal is puttin goff going to the movies so you can afford the decent steak.
09-11-2017T21:21:15,Dadrobit,putting off*
09-11-2017T21:22:39,BluePhantom90,"From the great U.S. Army of given knowledge, I shall give tom advice  that my Drill Sergeants tell us when we have headaches."

09-11-2017T21:23:28,CrRAR,"Ooo, could work."
09-11-2017T21:23:30,MarshallMelon,I hear that's a great way to put your mind off things
09-11-2017T21:23:41,BluePhantom90,nu. Or drink lots of water.
09-11-2017T21:23:48,MarshallMelon,Hail Hydrate
09-11-2017T21:23:48,CrRAR,Step 1) Be hero
09-11-2017T21:24:11,Bgrmystr2,"Yeah, Dadro's nailed it 100%"
09-11-2017T21:24:17,TheArtApprentice,Step 2) don't hide a pastry in your foot locker
09-11-2017T21:25:00,TheArtApprentice,Forgot the name of that movie
09-11-2017T21:25:16,MarshallMelon,"Honestly it depends on the cause of the headache. Dehydration is countered by water. Stress can be countered by massaging the right spot. Clusters, on the other hand..."
09-11-2017T21:25:30,CrRAR,oh no
09-11-2017T21:25:44,CrRAR,not that
09-11-2017T21:25:50,TheArtApprentice,What?
09-11-2017T21:25:51,MarshallMelon,Yeah. There's a reason they're called Suicide Headaches
09-11-2017T21:25:59,TheArtApprentice,Oh
09-11-2017T21:26:00,BadFoMo,"Step 3) Say ""Come to Butt-Head""?"
09-11-2017T21:26:04,unsteddyphoenix,Oooo ive heard of those
09-11-2017T21:26:05,CrRAR,anything but the clusters
09-11-2017T21:26:31,Dadrobit,"Apprentice, you're thinking of Full Metal Jacket."
09-11-2017T21:26:35,BluePhantom90,"could be not drinking enough water, or blood suger is low"
09-11-2017T21:26:37,BadFoMo,Clusters?
09-11-2017T21:26:42,TheArtApprentice,Yes thanks Dad
09-11-2017T21:26:53,TheArtApprentice,Robit
09-11-2017T21:26:56,MarshallMelon,They're basically like 100 migraines hitting you simultaneously every day or week for minutes on end
09-11-2017T21:26:58,MarshallMelon,No cure
