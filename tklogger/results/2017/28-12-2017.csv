28-12-2017T22:52:23,DJSylveon,.///. why do you want black hole boobies
28-12-2017T22:52:30,unsteddyphoenix,Obviously it would be Natani or Clovis with the mammoth boobs
28-12-2017T22:52:39,ZRO4825,Clovis. Has to be Clovis. :joy:
28-12-2017T22:52:47,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"DJ if boobs are not blocking the flow of time and space, not big enough"
28-12-2017T22:52:58,SageSaga,i want him to draw big boobs that are fun to draw not big boobs that a chore to draw
28-12-2017T22:53:00,NeonMitsumi,lifts an eyebrow.
28-12-2017T22:53:10,unsteddyphoenix,That's a...difficult distinction
28-12-2017T22:53:10,DJSylveon,See someone agrees with me
28-12-2017T22:53:29,ZRO4825,Wait...so does Toyoko fall under fun to draw? :rofl:
28-12-2017T22:53:40,unsteddyphoenix,How big is unfun :thinking:
28-12-2017T22:53:40,SageSaga,Toyoko is the maximum fun size
28-12-2017T22:53:44,MarvTheHugPharaoh,lol
28-12-2017T22:53:46,ZRO4825,I can agree with this.

28-12-2017T22:54:16,SageSaga,Tom has drawn Toyoko
28-12-2017T22:54:21,Twokinds,"lol Natani is only biggest because Natani is one of the largest female characters in general. Proportionally, Adelaide is smaller and Kathrin is larger, relative to their frames."
28-12-2017T22:54:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,!?

28-12-2017T23:01:52,NeonMitsumi,Nothx
28-12-2017T23:01:57,Serpentfrog,Prodigous size alone is not admirable unless you consider exorbitant sanguination a virtue.
28-12-2017T23:01:59,unsteddyphoenix,hue
28-12-2017T23:02:05,Nekonny,"Well, sage mentored me on this one"

28-12-2017T23:03:29,SageSaga,quick question folks-
28-12-2017T23:03:34,NeonMitsumi,2
28-12-2017T23:03:36,SageSaga,how would you read these 3 panels?
28-12-2017T23:03:38,ZRO4825,Later Melon
28-12-2017T23:03:40,NeonMitsumi,Seeya Marshall!
28-12-2017T23:03:42,CrimsonHelsing,"Eh that's boring for me, and I might go mad at this point from the boredom with *even more* transformation stuff. But I guess I'm being a bit harsh there ^^;"
28-12-2017T23:03:44,Bgrmystr2,hmm
28-12-2017T23:03:49,ZRO4825,Upper left &gt; right &gt; lower left
28-12-2017T23:03:49,Serpentfrog,"In order, Sage."
28-12-2017T23:03:54,Bgrmystr2,"Top right, top left, then bottom left"
28-12-2017T23:03:57,DJSylveon,top left top right bottom left
28-12-2017T23:03:58,Bgrmystr2,but I'm spoiled
28-12-2017T23:04:01,Bgrmystr2,ignore me :v
28-12-2017T23:04:04,ZRO4825,"It's a comic, not a manga, Bgr! :P"
28-12-2017T23:04:08,Bgrmystr2,Ikr XD
28-12-2017T23:04:10,Sammit,Bye Marshall
28-12-2017T23:04:18,SageSaga,for ease of reference
28-12-2017T23:04:30,ZRO4825,&lt;3 Star X
28-12-2017T23:04:33,BadFoMo,"@SageSaga Heart, Star, X."
28-12-2017T23:04:36,DJSylveon,^
28-12-2017T23:04:37,Bgrmystr2,"yeah basically, same ^"
28-12-2017T23:04:49,InTheLionsDen,Same
28-12-2017T23:04:57,Bgrmystr2,the heart panel might be worth making a little bit taller
28-12-2017T23:05:00,SageSaga,Ron? Tom?
28-12-2017T23:05:03,Mihari,"Guess I'm the weird one, I'd go Heart X Star"
28-12-2017T23:05:12,Nekonny,"heart, star  cross"
28-12-2017T23:05:13,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, see I can understand"
28-12-2017T23:05:30,Bgrmystr2,it's cuz the heart panel is kinda small
28-12-2017T23:05:39,SageSaga,if i change this though-
28-12-2017T23:05:47,ZRO4825,"Yeah, I can see it either way, but my default pattern would be the way I said~"
28-12-2017T23:06:05,SageSaga,when its like this you would read Heart X Star?
28-12-2017T23:06:08,Nekonny,"Honestly, it could depend on the rest of the page"
28-12-2017T23:06:11,InTheLionsDen,Now Heart X star
28-12-2017T23:06:18,Nekonny,heart x star
28-12-2017T23:06:20,Bgrmystr2,"like that, it would definitely be heart X Star"
28-12-2017T23:06:28,BadFoMo,@SageSaga I think so.
28-12-2017T23:06:29,SageSaga,i think the long panel is called a Leading panel?
28-12-2017T23:06:30,Mihari,"See, size doesn't make a difference."
28-12-2017T23:06:38,SageSaga,it leads the eye to the next section
28-12-2017T23:06:42,Serpentfrog,Heart x star :ptv-shipit:
28-12-2017T23:06:43,Nekonny,it does
28-12-2017T23:06:44,Mihari,"Atleast to me, it's general paneling flow I've gotten used to with manga"
28-12-2017T23:06:51,Nekonny,depending on what is on the lower right
28-12-2017T23:06:54,Bgrmystr2,"it's not the size, it's the relation to the right panel"
28-12-2017T23:07:04,Bgrmystr2,and what's below it
28-12-2017T23:07:12,Mihari,Okay it DOES but I meant in this specific kinda case when things are side by side like that
28-12-2017T23:07:27,Bgrmystr2,this one's rather difficult so xD
28-12-2017T23:07:35,reddragon,Can I please post a link ?
28-12-2017T23:07:40,Bgrmystr2,I could see it either way
28-12-2017T23:07:47,Mihari,@reddragon Of what?
28-12-2017T23:07:54,TheBeckoner,I think heart - star - X
28-12-2017T23:07:57,TheBeckoner,idk tho
28-12-2017T23:08:11,TheBeckoner,I have to education to this stuff
28-12-2017T23:08:15,TheBeckoner,no*
28-12-2017T23:08:18,NeonMitsumi,The amount of accounts without profile picture tonight seems suspiciously high.
28-12-2017T23:08:33,ZRO4825,"Also, Sage, you completely missed a joke chance there by not putting a horse shoe in that third panel :P"
28-12-2017T23:08:35,reddragon,A song that I found youtube

28-12-2017T23:10:13,unsteddyphoenix,"I'd go heart-star, but if the star panel was bigger I might go heart-x"
28-12-2017T23:10:29,TheVileOne,@NeonMitsumi what do you mean? :ptv-wondering:
28-12-2017T23:10:49,Bgrmystr2,Ron has the right idea for the comparison. The left to right takes priority over top to bottomleast it should imo
28-12-2017T23:10:56,NeonMitsumi,lifts an eyebrow.
28-12-2017T23:11:46,Bgrmystr2,I need to pay attention to which chat is what &gt;.&gt; I'm sitting here talking in fluff's chat trying to talk to you guys

28-12-2017T23:40:57,Bgrmystr2,you could always talk to sage. But I don't know if that's a guarentee yes for the latter question :u
28-12-2017T23:41:00,unsteddyphoenix,If anyone in a multi starts talking I normally tune into them
28-12-2017T23:41:09,MarvTheHugPharaoh,same
28-12-2017T23:41:22,SageSaga,i could talk
28-12-2017T23:41:23,Bgrmystr2,Yeah same. Tis why I'm listening to Fluff's audio atm
28-12-2017T23:41:29,Bgrmystr2,since he chats it up
28-12-2017T23:41:47,ZRO4825,I have heard Sage talk before. It is a more rare occurence than Tom talking.
28-12-2017T23:41:51,TheBeckoner,I like Toms music choice \
28-12-2017T23:41:56,TheBeckoner,So I listen to him
28-12-2017T23:42:01,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah ive never heard Sage talk

28-12-2017T23:42:51,ZRO4825,lol Sage
28-12-2017T23:42:56,unsteddyphoenix,I see no evidence for this Sage
28-12-2017T23:43:08,unsteddyphoenix,"Or, hear, I guess."
28-12-2017T23:43:09,FatCowMom,Hallo
28-12-2017T23:43:14,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Mom
28-12-2017T23:43:20,Bgrmystr2,Sage didn't have the recordings turned on at the time
28-12-2017T23:43:27,SageSaga,Tom doesnt leave his house and when he does he doesnt talk to anyone! Im on discord all the time and I go out to hang out with friends!
28-12-2017T23:43:39,BadFoMo,Is Sage using a mic now?
28-12-2017T23:43:54,unsteddyphoenix,Mere conjecture
28-12-2017T23:43:56,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Tom just looks and people gift him what he needs
28-12-2017T23:43:59,unsteddyphoenix,I deal with EVIDENCE and FACTS
28-12-2017T23:44:14,Bgrmystr2,and sometimes opinions disguised as facts :v
28-12-2017T23:44:27,unsteddyphoenix,And sometime fake news
28-12-2017T23:44:39,ZRO4825,I can attest at least that Sage is on Discord. Still can't say anything 'bout the talking though. :P
28-12-2017T23:44:41,Bgrmystr2,that too.
28-12-2017T23:45:00,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I have not seen Sage talk at all on Katbox server
28-12-2017T23:45:19,unsteddyphoenix,Witness testimony speaks volumes
28-12-2017T23:45:28,unsteddyphoenix,Which is the OPPOSITE of how much Sage speaks~
28-12-2017T23:45:37,MidnightBlue78,how about you all talk now? Problem solved
28-12-2017T23:46:18,ZRO4825,Kaylin looks kinda like a happy tanned Maren with pointy ears :o lol
28-12-2017T23:46:40,MarvTheHugPharaoh,lol
28-12-2017T23:46:41,Nekonny,I kinda hhave a cold
