26-12-2017T22:56:44,OMGITSABIST,Is Tom inking without the sketch?
26-12-2017T22:56:56,WereKeidran,"I'm totally hungry but I can't eat, flu has me down"
26-12-2017T22:56:58,MarshallMelon,Sketch layer is faded
26-12-2017T22:56:59,NeonMitsumi,@Combak What's the joke there?
26-12-2017T22:57:00,Combak,"No, he already did the sketchBist."
26-12-2017T22:57:01,PicartoRowan,there is a sketch with little transparency
26-12-2017T22:57:54,PalmettoPathfinder1,I just saw the Last Jedi!

26-12-2017T22:58:26,Combak,"... Wait, I missed the word ""Just"" in there. XD"
26-12-2017T22:58:29,PalmettoPathfinder1,@Combak just two hours ago as well?
26-12-2017T22:58:32,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Not the jarjar

26-12-2017T22:58:54,OMGITSABIST,I can't seem to see the sketch layer for some reason
26-12-2017T22:58:56,Serpentfrog,You mean Darth Binks?
26-12-2017T22:59:01,EnergisticAnomaly,Dark bowser is prolly my favorite boss battle at least in terms of music.
26-12-2017T22:59:14,JustARedFox,^
26-12-2017T22:59:21,NeonMitsumi,You mean the character that makes the movie good?
26-12-2017T22:59:26,Combak,It is pretty good.
26-12-2017T22:59:26,MarvTheHugPharaoh,lol
26-12-2017T22:59:37,PalmettoPathfinder1,@MarshallMelon yep just now.  Or actually three hours ago.
26-12-2017T22:59:37,unsteddyphoenix,You mean the main character of the prequels?
26-12-2017T22:59:43,Bgrmystr2,"Bist, what we see is what tom sees"
26-12-2017T22:59:46,MarshallMelon,Okay real talk though. The Porgs were unnecessary AF
26-12-2017T22:59:57,PicartoRowan,why does this look like the page was flipped
26-12-2017T23:00:03,CrRAR,it issss
26-12-2017T23:00:10,PalmettoPathfinder1,But you have to admit the Vulptice were cool
26-12-2017T23:00:11,Bgrmystr2,because Tom flips the page sometimes
26-12-2017T23:00:12,PicartoRowan,oh
26-12-2017T23:00:14,Serpentfrog,Real talk Star Trek is better than Star Wars.
26-12-2017T23:00:16,CrRAR,for accuracy checks
26-12-2017T23:00:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Firefly you fool
26-12-2017T23:00:23,MarshallMelon,Damn straight Serp
26-12-2017T23:00:25,Combak,"Oh, oh! I know why they added the porgs!"
26-12-2017T23:00:27,ZizzoGaming,No SERP.
26-12-2017T23:00:32,MarshallMelon,Enterprise &gt; Falcon fite me IRL
26-12-2017T23:00:36,Serpentfrog,Firefly &gt; Star Trek &gt; Star Wars
26-12-2017T23:00:38,PicartoRowan,that's good
26-12-2017T23:00:40,Bgrmystr2,"because merchandicing, Combak?"
26-12-2017T23:00:44,Bgrmystr2,literally only reason imo
26-12-2017T23:00:45,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Good man
26-12-2017T23:00:47,DontuDare,Real talk SpaceJam was Better
26-12-2017T23:01:04,PicartoRowan,you people talk about ships
26-12-2017T23:01:11,PicartoRowan,i prefer a Stargate instead
26-12-2017T23:01:17,BluePhantom90,lol its the hair
26-12-2017T23:01:23,Serpentfrog,Titanic &gt; Na'rella
26-12-2017T23:01:24,MarshallMelon,But Spaceball One is greater than all
26-12-2017T23:01:25,Combak,"The porgs were added to hide the puffins on the island. They couldn't have them not be in shots, and it was easier to put something over them instead of hide them."
26-12-2017T23:01:35,Combak,"Plus, they're cute and funny."
26-12-2017T23:01:38,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Serenity is my fav
26-12-2017T23:01:49,Combak,"Ah, Spaceballs is great. XD"
26-12-2017T23:01:52,Serpentfrog,And porgs are delicious too.
26-12-2017T23:01:53,MarshallMelon,Hiding Puffins on the island is fine. But having them in the Falcon is not
26-12-2017T23:02:41,Combak,"Meh, they've been in most of the movie at that point; might as well include them for some humor for the rest of it."
26-12-2017T23:02:42,Serpentfrog,"There's no place I could be, once I've found Serenity."
26-12-2017T23:02:43,PicartoRowan,Ooh Starbound
26-12-2017T23:02:58,MarvTheHugPharaoh,you can't take the sky from me

26-12-2017T23:04:48,Tegani,Really not pleased with the Porgs. They serve no purpose in the storyline.  The Crystal Foxes should have been the cute merchandise.
26-12-2017T23:05:05,PicartoRowan,also Natani looks cute here
26-12-2017T23:05:10,Serpentfrog,How boring a name was crystal foxes though?
26-12-2017T23:05:22,MarshallMelon,I love how the chat instantly snowballed as soon as someone mentioned TLJ
26-12-2017T23:05:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Crystal critters
26-12-2017T23:05:27,Tegani,They had some in-movie name... I just don't recall it.
26-12-2017T23:05:30,Mustanglvr007,Lol
26-12-2017T23:05:31,MarshallMelon,Vulptices

26-12-2017T23:06:40,Twokinds,Just draw them perfectly then you won't have any problems
26-12-2017T23:06:41,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Someday when you are older You could get hit by a boulder
26-12-2017T23:06:42,MarshallMelon,Or go OG Madness style and use crosses
26-12-2017T23:06:53,Combak,Try a ruler to help.

26-12-2017T23:13:46,PalmettoPathfinder1,Looking forward to when Nat will let Sythe know the truth.  But yeah I agree I thought those vulptice would have played a bigger role in the movie but they were still cool.
26-12-2017T23:13:47,Willow12,Why are the streams so late?
26-12-2017T23:13:48,MidnightBlue78,"yes, since the holidays XD"

26-12-2017T23:14:25,NeonMitsumi,Because timezones
