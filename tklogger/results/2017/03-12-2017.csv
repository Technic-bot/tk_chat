03-12-2017T00:09:52,Combak,It's pretty unusual Dino.
03-12-2017T00:10:00,MarvTheHugPharaoh,all dogs are american heros

03-12-2017T00:19:37,Dinoman515,Afterstream chats are weird.
03-12-2017T00:19:54,MarvTheHugPharaoh,only after stream chats are weird?
03-12-2017T00:19:55,Serpentfrog,During stream chats are weird.
03-12-2017T00:20:52,ZRO4825,TK chat. It's always weird.
03-12-2017T00:20:57,Dinoman515,Then afterstream chats are weirder... better?
03-12-2017T00:21:20,ZRO4825,"TK chat. If we can't turn you on, we'll at least make you feel dirty. Showers mandatory."
03-12-2017T00:21:27,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"not really, afterstream chats are pretty tame compared to during stream"
03-12-2017T00:21:30,Serpentfrog,We all float down here.

03-12-2017T00:41:05,Bgrmystr2,bitrate seems a bit high for 1080p
03-12-2017T00:41:11,Bgrmystr2,but it's nice
03-12-2017T00:41:12,Dadrobit,"If you're keeping the vertically scrolling text top right for general purposes, you might consider slowing it down a tad bit."
03-12-2017T00:41:13,FenceEqualizer,Hope this isn't a placebo effect cause it looks better to me.
03-12-2017T00:41:13,Bgrmystr2,very sharp

03-12-2017T00:48:22,unsteddyphoenix,"Or at least, OBS wont keep them from us"

03-12-2017T00:49:13,BadFoMo,@unsteddyphoenix So much for a break from my self appointed job.
03-12-2017T00:49:27,unsteddyphoenix,The hero we need
03-12-2017T00:50:16,TheJashter,So who lives here permanently?
03-12-2017T00:50:19,Twokinds,"I don't know how photoshop window capture is working, but I'm glad."
03-12-2017T00:50:35,Serpentfrog,0/ @Jash
03-12-2017T00:50:40,unsteddyphoenix,Is there any reason it WOULDNT work? :thinking:
03-12-2017T00:50:57,TheJashter,Yay for Toms success!
03-12-2017T00:51:12,Dinoman515,Woohoo!
03-12-2017T00:51:44,unsteddyphoenix,Or did it just...not work before for no reason
03-12-2017T00:51:49,Twokinds,"before, the way photoshop would work meant you couldn't see windows in photoshop, including canvases."
03-12-2017T00:51:49,unsteddyphoenix,And is now doing what it's supposed to lol
03-12-2017T00:52:07,Twokinds,So the only thing you could do is capture the whole screen and just crop it.
03-12-2017T00:52:23,Dinoman515,So this is a good thing right?
03-12-2017T00:52:31,Dadrobit,That's ghetto as hell.
03-12-2017T00:52:38,unsteddyphoenix,so photoshop windows were just...invisible?
03-12-2017T00:52:49,unsteddyphoenix,Why does OBS interact with everything so weirdly
03-12-2017T00:53:04,Twokinds,Yeah. You'd just see the grey background of photoshop when nothing's open
03-12-2017T00:53:27,FenceEqualizer,The cost of free unsteddy
03-12-2017T00:53:30,TheJashter,"OBS actually stands for Oddly Behaving Software, fyi"
03-12-2017T00:53:45,unsteddyphoenix,the more you know
03-12-2017T00:53:46,Dinoman515,"Oh, nice. Woohoo that it fixed itself?"
03-12-2017T00:53:48,Twokinds,"That's why sometimes when I accidentally minimize photoshop, you'd see the desktop."
03-12-2017T00:54:02,Dinoman515,"Ohh, thats what that was."
03-12-2017T00:54:09,unsteddyphoenix,'least your background's pretty
03-12-2017T00:54:11,Twokinds,"But now, it's specifically always displaying just the Photoshop window."
03-12-2017T00:54:20,Dinoman515,Great!
03-12-2017T00:54:21,Dadrobit,"Huh, so this means no more sneak peeks at your desktop."
03-12-2017T00:54:31,Bgrmystr2,Rip ppl wanting to see the desktop XD
03-12-2017T00:54:32,Ezedger,feelsbad :^)
03-12-2017T00:54:42,TheJashter,"Dangit, was looking forward to more desktop."
03-12-2017T00:54:42,Dinoman515,No more sneak peeks.
03-12-2017T00:54:48,Dinoman515,XD
03-12-2017T00:54:54,Twokinds,"So now I can, for example, move the obs tool onto my tablet screen, and not have that blackhole effect"
03-12-2017T00:55:12,unsteddyphoenix,Convinient
03-12-2017T00:55:22,Dinoman515,👌
03-12-2017T00:55:24,DarthRexKing,the stream crashed?
03-12-2017T00:55:30,unsteddyphoenix,Was the OBS version you justr downloaded an updated version of the one you had?
03-12-2017T00:55:38,Twokinds,Yeah
03-12-2017T00:56:01,unsteddyphoenix,"I seee~ so they fixed I guess, nice."
03-12-2017T00:56:21,unsteddyphoenix,Hopefully everything feels smoother from now
03-12-2017T00:56:36,TheJashter,Thatll be great
03-12-2017T00:56:39,DarthRexKing,And what were you saying sorry about an email for?
03-12-2017T00:56:42,Dinoman515,"""Hopefully""?"
03-12-2017T00:56:59,unsteddyphoenix,"well, OBS could always mess with something else for no reason"
03-12-2017T00:57:07,TheJashter,Email notification for followers
03-12-2017T00:57:22,Dinoman515,"Yeah, wish that couldnt happen tho."
03-12-2017T00:57:43,Dinoman515,But some wishes just cant come true...
03-12-2017T00:57:48,Serpentfrog,Quit whinging and change your settings.

03-12-2017T00:59:09,Dadrobit,"Hey, Tom. This probably doesn't need to be said, but you might probably, definitely want to go make a backup of your stream setup right about now."
03-12-2017T00:59:12,unsteddyphoenix,"That's so weird, it's not that uncommon I thought?"
03-12-2017T00:59:18,Serpentfrog,Whinging is its own word.
03-12-2017T00:59:38,TheJashter,I love whings! Spicy ones are good.
