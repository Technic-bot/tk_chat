397,2018-01-03 18:11:07,Twokinds,Welp
398,2018-01-03 18:11:12,Twokinds,No audio I guess

433,2018-01-03 18:12:39,Twokinds,I opened a second audio channel with the same settings as the first
434,2018-01-03 18:12:43,Twokinds,Now there's two playing the same thing
444,2018-01-03 18:13:17,Twokinds,I mean fine whatever works
656,2018-01-03 18:38:36,Twokinds,None of the real bouncy songs have come up yet

866,2018-01-03 19:00:33,Twokinds,"There you go, another hint."

1255,2018-01-03 19:27:59,Twokinds,Not in the mainline comics
1264,2018-01-03 19:28:53,Twokinds,Raine is full human with the ability to transform into a wolf. her parents were both humans when she was conceived.
1385,2018-01-03 19:37:27,Twokinds,The spell functions via universal truth.
1393,2018-01-03 19:37:58,Twokinds,"If Trace himself allows in an assassin disguised as a servant, the spell will still kick them out because Trace wouldn't want him in if he knew."
1452,2018-01-03 19:43:13,Twokinds,I'm not good at 3D modelling
1473,2018-01-03 19:45:09,Twokinds,"The reason is that my style has kinda shifted more to cartoony, and I feel solid stripes just look nicer this way"
1478,2018-01-03 19:45:36,Twokinds,Ahoy Moooooom!
1481,2018-01-03 19:45:48,Twokinds,Long time no see. I thought you died.
1608,2018-01-03 19:54:22,Twokinds,Nib's parents were killed in a tragic origin story accident
1636,2018-01-03 19:56:14,Twokinds,They died after taking a shortcut down Squirrelmurder Alley when leaving the theater
1645,2018-01-03 19:56:44,Twokinds,"Luckily, her mother's protection saved her from the dark squirrel's power, leaving only a scar."
1665,2018-01-03 19:57:36,Twokinds,Yeah you just can't see it. It's under the fur.
1755,2018-01-03 20:05:28,Twokinds,This is my greatest work
1782,2018-01-03 20:06:20,Twokinds,This is about 2 years before Twokinds.
1795,2018-01-03 20:06:46,Twokinds,2 or 3 years.
1798,2018-01-03 20:06:52,Twokinds,I think I was 13 when I drew this.

2501,2018-01-03 20:49:43,Twokinds,I was supposed to go get food when I finished inking
2502,2018-01-03 20:49:46,Twokinds,I forgot....

2915,2018-01-03 21:16:24,Twokinds,Why did the chicken cross the road?

3665,2018-01-03 22:57:29,Twokinds,I was pretty proud of that one
3672,2018-01-03 23:00:22,Twokinds,Jeez I have to very carefully change all the 2017s to 2018
3678,2018-01-03 23:04:33,Twokinds,Only one so far
3679,2018-01-03 23:04:42,Twokinds,But I'm sure I'll slip up more as time goes on.
3680,2018-01-03 23:05:05,Twokinds,"Then again, I like 2018 as a number better than 2017 so it shouldn't be too hard."
3681,2018-01-03 23:05:10,Twokinds,I didn't like 2007 either.
3682,2018-01-03 23:05:14,Twokinds,Such an awkward number.
50,2018-01-04 00:35:29,Twokinds,Sythe probably wouldn't entertain the idea at all if he didn't see firsthand Raine's transformation.
55,2018-01-04 00:47:06,Twokinds,Pretty far back. It pretty much started  happening the moment humans and keidran collided.
58,2018-01-04 00:48:41,Twokinds,"Hm, it's vague, isn't it?"
59,2018-01-04 00:48:46,Twokinds,lol

2039,2018-01-04 23:04:04,Twokinds,I've never had a fuse go before. I think it was the space heater.

2080,2018-01-04 23:06:04,Twokinds,I can go an hour without power
2093,2018-01-04 23:06:42,Twokinds,This house IS old
2097,2018-01-04 23:06:48,Twokinds,The outlets don't even have ground
2103,2018-01-04 23:07:05,Twokinds,They're two-prong. All of them. It's a problem.
2118,2018-01-04 23:07:45,Twokinds,It's a house from the 60s.
2126,2018-01-04 23:08:08,Twokinds,I wish I could get the plugs changed to ones with grounding
2136,2018-01-04 23:08:34,Twokinds,It would require rewiring everything.
2161,2018-01-04 23:10:09,Twokinds,I'm planning to move anyway.
2184,2018-01-04 23:12:01,Twokinds,"No, just shopping around for now"

2662,2018-01-04 23:47:32,Twokinds,I dunno. Probably some deadly artifacts. Disguarded traps. A phylactery or two.
2675,2018-01-04 23:48:16,Twokinds,And alternate universe portal. Doomsday device. Something that turns Mike into a girl again. The usual.

2288,2018-01-05 18:02:50,Twokinds,But here is an anicdote I found while googling:
2290,2018-01-05 18:02:55,Twokinds,"""unless it can be proven person A is specifically trying to harass person B, then person B must leave. My ex wife filed one on me. If I am within 500' of her for any reason, even if she comes to somewhere I am already, I must leave"""

4397,2018-01-06 20:18:29,Twokinds,I don't know what they're called.

48,2018-01-07 16:49:00,Twokinds,My real goal is to find out which characters are underrated and draw them xD

169,2018-01-07 17:16:56,Twokinds,no
179,2018-01-07 17:19:09,Twokinds,I can do it if I make it just canon Twokinds characters with less than 15 tags on Patreon

1012,2018-01-08 02:10:04,Twokinds,Then you can just turn them off and on or adjust them whenever.
1015,2018-01-08 02:10:16,Twokinds,"The only problem is it makes the filesize a lot bigger, lol."

1087,2018-01-08 02:13:25,Twokinds,I'll be back Wed for the comic stream
1121,2018-01-08 02:19:03,Twokinds,You are welcome!

873,2018-01-09 21:47:47,Twokinds,Trace has a mom
883,2018-01-09 21:48:42,Twokinds,She went for a walk in the manor and got lost a few years ago.
895,2018-01-09 21:49:27,Twokinds,"She's a few hundred miles away, in the west wing of the estate."
906,2018-01-09 21:50:55,Twokinds,yeah 3rd floor leads to the other estate districts and travel terminals.
1023,2018-01-09 22:02:36,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-NoraEyebrows:
1079,2018-01-09 22:07:20,Twokinds,I'm going to delay the stream for now. It's not ready yet.
1092,2018-01-09 22:07:49,Twokinds,"Not sure, need to finish sketching this page first."
1120,2018-01-09 22:09:23,Twokinds,I'm considering hiring someone to help me out with the thumbnailing process.
1128,2018-01-09 22:10:05,Twokinds,Oh right I'm talking to non-comicy people.
1136,2018-01-09 22:10:25,Twokinds,Thumbnailing is the process of roughly sketching out the layout of each page.
1150,2018-01-09 22:11:22,Twokinds,I hate it. So getting someone else to do scripts and prelim sketches would save a lot of time.
1176,2018-01-09 22:13:35,Twokinds,It's not writing the scripts or sketching the page. It's the inbetween part. The process of taking a sketch and breaking it down into 6-10 panel chunks and directing the scene and pacing for each panel.
1179,2018-01-09 22:14:04,Twokinds,taking a script*
18,2018-01-10 00:35:53,Twokinds,Give what
25,2018-01-10 00:37:28,Twokinds,Eh could be better
28,2018-01-10 00:38:55,Twokinds,A little
218,2018-01-10 02:37:04,Twokinds,Cool
225,2018-01-10 03:21:14,Twokinds,lol That'd be mean

558,2018-01-10 18:48:37,Twokinds,Feeling accomplished
573,2018-01-10 18:49:47,Twokinds,I just recently spent 15500 dollars!
590,2018-01-10 18:50:24,Twokinds,Retirement fund contributions for 2018
628,2018-01-10 18:53:08,Twokinds,I would recommend it. Always good to plan for the future.
630,2018-01-10 18:53:17,Twokinds,Don't want to be 60  years old and regret it.
672,2018-01-10 18:56:47,Twokinds,That's what I'm doing. I've got a Roth IRA
676,2018-01-10 18:56:58,Twokinds,"Not giving investing advice of course,  but mine are through Vanguard."
690,2018-01-10 18:58:40,Twokinds,That's... pretty bad.
693,2018-01-10 18:59:03,Twokinds,"I mean, even my terrible bank savings account gives .70%"
694,2018-01-10 18:59:16,Twokinds,You ARE losing money at .01%
695,2018-01-10 18:59:26,Twokinds,To inflation
702,2018-01-10 19:00:01,Twokinds,I'm using a dead-simple lazy portfolio

798,2018-01-10 19:09:00,Twokinds,I'm a huge nerd when it comes to investing.
810,2018-01-10 19:09:57,Twokinds,It's like an RPG in real life. Trying to make the numbers to get bigger.
825,2018-01-10 19:11:01,Twokinds,Taxes are the tedious boss
843,2018-01-10 19:12:54,Twokinds,"Hm, I don't remember that"
844,2018-01-10 19:13:00,Twokinds,Maybe I will check it out
892,2018-01-10 19:19:58,Twokinds,Should have been protein powder

1327,2018-01-10 20:10:14,Twokinds,I dunno
1330,2018-01-10 20:10:16,Twokinds,I had to look it up
1335,2018-01-10 20:10:41,Twokinds,Oooor
1336,2018-01-10 20:10:46,Twokinds,"You could do what I did, and have it delivered"

1480,2018-01-10 20:20:31,Twokinds,one moment
1669,2018-01-10 20:37:40,Twokinds,Byyeeee ron
1787,2018-01-10 20:50:23,Twokinds,Infection is the biggest issue.
1793,2018-01-10 20:50:37,Twokinds,"That can't be fixed by magic, because no one knows what causes it."
1830,2018-01-10 20:53:06,Twokinds,Knowing what something is and why it is are two very different things
1831,2018-01-10 20:53:21,Twokinds,People have known since all of human history what infections WERE
1833,2018-01-10 20:53:25,Twokinds,They didn't know why
1844,2018-01-10 20:54:08,Twokinds,Oh come on. Are you being serious right now?
1863,2018-01-10 20:56:10,Twokinds,No one's dying
1903,2018-01-10 20:58:33,Twokinds,Yeah infection would be a long term thing
1929,2018-01-10 21:00:09,Twokinds,yes
1981,2018-01-10 21:02:13,Twokinds,Like an hour

2368,2018-01-10 21:28:43,Twokinds,I dunno.
2387,2018-01-10 21:29:31,Twokinds,General rules of thumb
2393,2018-01-10 21:29:41,Twokinds,And drawing them over and over for 15 years
2454,2018-01-10 21:33:46,Twokinds,NO
2455,2018-01-10 21:33:51,Twokinds,It was important!

2507,2018-01-10 21:36:27,Twokinds,He's gotta die in a blaze of glory with his awesome magical steampunk claw-leg
2691,2018-01-10 21:48:21,Twokinds,My internet went out
2828,2018-01-10 22:01:57,Twokinds,Dang it
2833,2018-01-10 22:02:06,Twokinds,Lotta dropped frames
2891,2018-01-10 22:06:46,Twokinds,"Huh, that's true"
2910,2018-01-10 22:08:06,Twokinds,Yeah I'm trying some experimental stuff on this page
3089,2018-01-10 22:24:36,Twokinds,Done

3159,2018-01-10 22:28:22,Twokinds,Yeah her shirt is ripped.
3166,2018-01-10 22:28:44,Twokinds,It's pretty much a... long sleeved turtleneck with no stomach part
3184,2018-01-10 22:29:27,Twokinds,I'm sure Kat would be willing to make a new one for her
3193,2018-01-10 22:29:54,Twokinds,I'm done for now too
3219,2018-01-10 22:30:35,Twokinds,Byeee everyone!
3223,2018-01-10 22:30:40,Twokinds,Sorry for the technical difficulties
3240,2018-01-10 22:31:06,Twokinds,I have no clue what's going on with my internet
3265,2018-01-10 22:33:22,Twokinds,"I'm getting 36 down, 6 up"
3266,2018-01-10 22:33:30,Twokinds,That's... definitely not right.
3275,2018-01-10 22:33:57,Twokinds,I shouldn't be

141,2018-01-11 01:54:56,Twokinds,Aw crap
142,2018-01-11 01:55:15,Twokinds,My new keyboard I like doesn't have a numpad :\
144,2018-01-11 02:02:28,Twokinds,"Nah, probably not. It's a cheap, pretty niche keyboard."
145,2018-01-11 02:05:08,Twokinds,The only reason I bought this one was because it was referbished anyway.
147,2018-01-11 02:06:44,Twokinds,I use a few alt codes.
148,2018-01-11 02:07:00,Twokinds,alt+7 makes •
149,2018-01-11 02:07:32,Twokinds,alt+0151 makes —
150,2018-01-11 02:08:05,Twokinds,alt+0150 makes –
151,2018-01-11 02:08:29,Twokinds,But the alt codes only work on the numpad
153,2018-01-11 02:10:17,Twokinds,It's nothing.
154,2018-01-11 02:10:43,Twokinds,I just got a nice bluetooth keyboard that can switch between devices.
155,2018-01-11 02:11:03,Twokinds,It's just inconvenient without a numpad.
156,2018-01-11 02:16:39,Twokinds,"Actually, I may have found a replacement. It's more expensive, but... eh..."
157,2018-01-11 02:17:01,Twokinds,Ordered.
159,2018-01-11 02:19:37,Twokinds,That's actually the exact one I ordered.
160,2018-01-11 02:19:39,Twokinds,Haha
161,2018-01-11 02:20:15,Twokinds,Refurbished. So it was cheaper.
600,2018-01-11 21:14:25,Twokinds,No streams today bye
739,2018-01-11 22:02:35,Twokinds,One minute. I'm working on it.
745,2018-01-11 22:03:00,Twokinds,Stupid thing is never working.
817,2018-01-11 22:07:49,Twokinds,HAPPY BIRTHDAY AEORONWAH
833,2018-01-11 22:09:11,Twokinds,No I have no idea what to do with that one
838,2018-01-11 22:09:32,Twokinds,Adelaide giving advice to Natani isn't really a visual suggestion.
853,2018-01-11 22:10:40,Twokinds,But Natani doesn't even have a father
858,2018-01-11 22:10:57,Twokinds,Natani is the chosen one. Born from the force.
901,2018-01-11 22:14:13,Twokinds,My work inspired me to draw too.
1067,2018-01-11 22:30:10,Twokinds,I can't tell if my tablet is flickering or if I'm hallucinating
1073,2018-01-11 22:30:33,Twokinds,Of course not
1074,2018-01-11 22:30:58,Twokinds,That would be a bad thing to have on a drawing tablet. Anything that messes with colors or brightness could throw things off.
1077,2018-01-11 22:31:08,Twokinds,I think the lights in my house are flickering too
1084,2018-01-11 22:31:31,Twokinds,"No, it's inconsistant"
1086,2018-01-11 22:31:35,Twokinds,It did just snow a lot
1092,2018-01-11 22:32:08,Twokinds,It already is
1097,2018-01-11 22:32:40,Twokinds,It stopped I think
1253,2018-01-11 22:49:36,Twokinds,"I remember that book, with the pigs. So sad when the spider dies."
1268,2018-01-11 22:51:08,Twokinds,Close enough
1278,2018-01-11 22:52:20,Twokinds,"Knowing Keidran, she's probably her cousin and aunt"

188,2018-01-12 00:38:38,Twokinds,I am unfortunately puttering out
194,2018-01-12 00:39:21,Twokinds,I don't want to continue working on a Nora Card unless I can give it 100% so I'm gunna call it here.

3274,2018-01-13 19:34:14,Twokinds,He doesn't even wear them.
3286,2018-01-13 19:34:45,Twokinds,Because she's aBasitin now
3295,2018-01-13 19:35:25,Twokinds,Adelaide has literal fantasy gigantism
3305,2018-01-13 19:35:54,Twokinds,"Anyway, that's it!"

3425,2018-01-13 19:41:55,Twokinds,#5
3432,2018-01-13 19:42:03,Twokinds,Humanoid Reni is spoiler.
3444,2018-01-13 19:42:23,Twokinds,Pet pet pet

3493,2018-01-13 19:45:12,Twokinds,I'm done for tonight! Thanks for joining me!
3541,2018-01-13 19:46:58,Twokinds,That stream was pretty quick
3560,2018-01-13 19:48:05,Twokinds,"Yeah, other than the lizard, every other suggestion was only 1 o 2 characters"
3562,2018-01-13 19:48:09,Twokinds,That really speeds up the process
3570,2018-01-13 19:48:45,Twokinds,Mmhm
3590,2018-01-13 19:55:16,Twokinds,Too bad it's Sunday. These streams would have been filled tomorrow.
3603,2018-01-13 19:58:50,Twokinds,...
3610,2018-01-13 20:01:19,Twokinds,eugh
3614,2018-01-13 20:01:55,Twokinds,lizard shedding is creepy
3626,2018-01-13 20:02:47,Twokinds,They aren't either of those things
3648,2018-01-13 20:05:40,Twokinds,Heheh
3649,2018-01-13 20:05:47,Twokinds,No unfortunately the dragons have scales
3650,2018-01-13 20:05:51,Twokinds,Which they shed
3652,2018-01-13 20:06:05,Twokinds,The scales are used as money in some places.
3670,2018-01-13 20:08:21,Twokinds,Farmer consider it lucky to find a dragon sleeping in their fields. They can usually find a few disguarded scales.
3674,2018-01-13 20:09:28,Twokinds,"Well, probably not. It's not like a dragon would know a tresspasser from a resident."
3679,2018-01-13 20:09:52,Twokinds,That or trampled crops.
3685,2018-01-13 20:10:12,Twokinds,Heheh

3785,2018-01-13 20:37:00,Twokinds,Just realized I have one random hair on my head that's way longer than all the others.
3796,2018-01-13 20:39:37,Twokinds,"Uh, not it does not"
3797,2018-01-13 20:39:46,Twokinds,"And I doubt it could, or it'd hit the ceiling xD"
3813,2018-01-13 20:41:38,Twokinds,My hair goes to the bottom of my shoulderblades.
3818,2018-01-13 20:42:32,Twokinds,But the one hair was down to my tailbone. Almost twice as long.
3829,2018-01-13 20:43:15,Twokinds,Probably just a freakish random fast grower
3838,2018-01-13 20:43:56,Twokinds,Can't be
3839,2018-01-13 20:44:02,Twokinds,I already have a goatee

3909,2018-01-13 21:08:18,Twokinds,I'll be at virtual Cincinnati Comic-con
3911,2018-01-13 21:08:56,Twokinds,Nothing! Even better

1369,2018-01-16 23:06:56,Twokinds,"The pizza is jalapeno, black olive, mushroom, and pineapple pizza."
1508,2018-01-16 23:22:36,Twokinds,I don't see why not
1519,2018-01-16 23:23:52,Twokinds,Of course it's about getting high. Gotta ride the dragon.

809,2018-01-18 22:31:34,Twokinds,Nora in kneesocks does not sound like a good idea
810,2018-01-18 22:31:42,Twokinds,That will end in torn kneesocks.
821,2018-01-18 22:34:09,Twokinds,I don't think stretchy will help when you have knives for toes

2899,2018-01-19 17:33:46,Twokinds,"Thanks for forcing me to stream with you today, Sage!"
2910,2018-01-19 17:34:43,Twokinds,"I'm not going to be here, btw"
2917,2018-01-19 17:35:10,Twokinds,XD
2927,2018-01-19 17:36:11,Twokinds,Why does everything think I'm not streaming tomorrow?
2928,2018-01-19 17:36:31,Twokinds,I didn't say anything of the sort.

269,2018-01-20 15:53:09,Twokinds,"""Re-sketch of “don’t be shy” (Keith) from comicon"" Which sketch?"

273,2018-01-20 15:53:45,Twokinds,"Well, okay now"
277,2018-01-20 15:53:57,Twokinds,"It needs to be short, but to the point."
288,2018-01-20 15:55:10,Twokinds,Oh I see
292,2018-01-20 15:55:42,Twokinds,"One person's suggestion is just ""SailorFederation"""
294,2018-01-20 15:55:45,Twokinds,I don't know what that means.
298,2018-01-20 15:56:10,Twokinds,Ah
301,2018-01-20 15:56:22,Twokinds,"Yeah, he switched the lines. WHY? How"
327,2018-01-20 15:58:32,Twokinds,"""Flora gets freaked out by a surprise cucumber."" okay, I Know what this is referencing. Cats getting startled by cucumbers."
331,2018-01-20 15:58:48,Twokinds,But I don't think I can draw it without the cucumber looking like something else.
345,2018-01-20 15:59:19,Twokinds,One week what?
349,2018-01-20 15:59:28,Twokinds,Cooldown what?
352,2018-01-20 15:59:36,Twokinds,Yeah it's a week
354,2018-01-20 15:59:42,Twokinds,A month

431,2018-01-20 16:04:56,Twokinds,"Your suggestions are always like, 4 people full body, 3 dragons, full scale. SO MUCH."
451,2018-01-20 16:06:13,Twokinds,"Next week, 144 char limit"
518,2018-01-20 16:10:42,Twokinds,I'm not upset or anything. I'm just letting you know.
523,2018-01-20 16:10:52,Twokinds,It's difficult to draw so much for one suggestion.
530,2018-01-20 16:11:26,Twokinds,I don't want to put hard limits
536,2018-01-20 16:11:56,Twokinds,"5 or 6 characters are fine when, say, half of them are obscured, or behind a table, or distant and undetailed."
537,2018-01-20 16:12:07,Twokinds,It's when people ask for full-body characters or dragons that it's a problem.
548,2018-01-20 16:13:10,Twokinds,Stream will begin at 4:30
552,2018-01-20 16:13:31,Twokinds,"You can have full body characters, but then limit it to one or two."
732,2018-01-20 16:28:39,Twokinds,Hm... maybe I should try have the suggestions be short (max 90 char) and then an optional line where people can add details.
745,2018-01-20 16:29:30,Twokinds,One thing that takes so much time is me rephrasing suggestions to make them shorter.
762,2018-01-20 16:30:22,Twokinds,"Yeah, it'd be a good place to put references."
771,2018-01-20 16:30:45,Twokinds,"Like, the line cold be titled ""OPTIONAL: Add details or references here"""

1625,2018-01-24 18:49:11,Twokinds,"There's some inate tallent of of course, but 90% of ""innate talent"" is just... the willingness to do it."

1768,2018-01-24 21:05:16,Twokinds,"Or look up a picture online, and copy it."
1797,2018-01-24 21:39:28,Twokinds,I'm finally getting into Reni's backstory a little with the next view pages. I'm happy :D
1848,2018-01-24 21:55:25,Twokinds,Yeah a few days extra will help me a lot
1849,2018-01-24 21:55:47,Twokinds,Just takes a long time. I've got four pages scripted.
1857,2018-01-24 21:57:51,Twokinds,Just 100 to go.
1866,2018-01-24 21:58:52,Twokinds,My goal is to plan out the rest of the year.

1980,2018-01-24 23:39:23,Twokinds,You have to use your imagination to see it.
1982,2018-01-24 23:41:17,Twokinds,"Wait, then how are you sad"

60,2018-01-26 00:06:24,Twokinds,Yeah but I don't want her to be too big.
99,2018-01-26 00:09:32,Twokinds,Reni's supposed to be small for a dragon
117,2018-01-26 00:11:19,Twokinds,How's that?
137,2018-01-26 00:13:20,Twokinds,He's a dragon
140,2018-01-26 00:13:31,Twokinds,And they specifically said the bags reduce weight
722,2018-01-26 01:18:47,Twokinds,I am unfortunately crashing pretty hard over here.
724,2018-01-26 01:18:59,Twokinds,I don't think I have the energy to do the rest of the shading and backgrounds
729,2018-01-26 01:19:17,Twokinds,I'll get it done tomorrah

823,2018-01-27 16:18:46,Twokinds,Nora would know.
824,2018-01-27 16:18:51,Twokinds,She can see out of all her cards.
993,2018-01-27 16:35:55,Twokinds,"Yeah, I figured it'd make it easier for people to see the full picture when I'm zoomed in"
1109,2018-01-27 16:49:23,Twokinds,Flora doesn't have pierced ears
1122,2018-01-27 16:50:24,Twokinds,"Well, they'd probably have some sort of fabric solution for that"
1123,2018-01-27 16:50:34,Twokinds,"Like, a strip of cloth that goes over the zipper."
1124,2018-01-27 16:50:42,Twokinds,So it's between the body and the zipper itself.
1147,2018-01-27 16:52:18,Twokinds,My mother has a lot of doggy clothes for her dogs XD and they do that with zippers.
1149,2018-01-27 16:52:26,Twokinds,Have a little cloth shield so the fur doesn't get caught.
1209,2018-01-27 16:57:11,Twokinds,CC

2107,2018-01-27 18:29:07,Twokinds,Just got a message
2111,2018-01-27 18:29:16,Twokinds,"All it says is ""make rice"" so I guess I'm doing that real quick."

2312,2018-01-27 18:55:10,Twokinds,"Funny enough, what made me decided to do it, is because it'd make the number of skeches for the month an even number."
2313,2018-01-27 18:55:20,Twokinds,So the two rows on the voting form would be equal.
2332,2018-01-27 18:57:12,Twokinds,Well I also did it because I liked the idea ^^
2552,2018-01-27 19:23:18,Twokinds,"Okay, sure"

2987,2018-01-27 20:00:33,Twokinds,"Anyway, that's coming this year :)"
2992,2018-01-27 20:00:47,Twokinds,"It'll go over both how to draw, and how to start a webcomic."
3005,2018-01-27 20:01:35,Twokinds,Hehe

3018,2018-01-27 20:02:47,Twokinds,...ehehe
3027,2018-01-27 20:03:07,Twokinds,There's no helping the Voyager
3079,2018-01-27 20:09:34,Twokinds,I hadn't considered any gryphons
3173,2018-01-27 20:21:39,Twokinds,I like olives too
3176,2018-01-27 20:22:00,Twokinds,Yeah
3190,2018-01-27 20:24:21,Twokinds,I just like flavor extremes.
3194,2018-01-27 20:24:34,Twokinds,I eat green olives a lot just because they're sour.
3200,2018-01-27 20:25:11,Twokinds,No. I just don't like boring stuff. More flavor = more betterer!
3214,2018-01-27 20:26:13,Twokinds,Yes!
3218,2018-01-27 20:26:30,Twokinds,"I had some stuffed green olives recently, it was very good."

3659,2018-01-27 21:46:32,Twokinds,Done
3688,2018-01-27 21:47:55,Twokinds,1 martini  = $5. w/ Kat  garnish = $500.

3730,2018-01-27 21:50:18,Twokinds,But not right now XD I'm tired

3816,2018-01-27 21:56:15,Twokinds,I thought that went well.
3826,2018-01-27 21:57:47,Twokinds,"Well, there's always the timelaps ^^"
3829,2018-01-27 21:57:59,Twokinds,"Yeah, this month was good."

3832,2018-01-27 21:58:48,Twokinds,Yeah XD
3833,2018-01-27 21:59:12,Twokinds,I wonder if it was actually because it was newer than all the others.
3834,2018-01-27 21:59:18,Twokinds,Or if it was just the power of the tiger booty.
3847,2018-01-27 22:00:53,Twokinds,"Could be, could be"
3848,2018-01-27 22:01:04,Twokinds,"Though I don't think they'd vote for it if they didn't like it, regardless."
3933,2018-01-27 23:03:38,Twokinds,"Not really. Most dragons don't, anyway."
261,2018-01-28 22:48:07,Twokinds,Youtube crashed
449,2018-01-28 23:13:38,Twokinds,I was wondering
450,2018-01-28 23:14:08,Twokinds,"Do any of you guys use these newfangled comic websites, like tapastic or webtoons, or whatever? What do you think of those."
470,2018-01-28 23:16:28,Twokinds,That's on there now?
491,2018-01-28 23:20:59,Twokinds,Yeah I was just wondering what the kids are using these days
492,2018-01-28 23:21:02,Twokinds,XD
508,2018-01-28 23:22:09,Twokinds,"It's so much easier these days to get yourself out there. But being so easy, it's also a lot harder to get noticed with so much."
525,2018-01-28 23:23:07,Twokinds,Yeah I do like tapastic's format
528,2018-01-28 23:23:14,Twokinds,It's very easy to read a comic
607,2018-01-28 23:28:58,Twokinds,Getting it wrong is the first step to getting it right
768,2018-01-28 23:43:54,Twokinds,RIght now I have 12 layers
787,2018-01-28 23:44:33,Twokinds,42 layers wouldn't be unusual
792,2018-01-28 23:44:48,Twokinds,Just depends.
443,2018-01-29 00:37:34,Twokinds,"Don't worry. Now that all the heroes are together, nothing bad will eeeever happen again"

959,2018-01-29 01:10:44,Twokinds,Just a simple round brush.
962,2018-01-29 01:10:57,Twokinds,I don't usually do anything fancy when it comes to inking.
963,2018-01-29 01:11:03,Twokinds,I'm on Reddit too much.

2660,2018-02-10 18:59:59,Twokinds,Just pull the string in the box
2664,2018-02-10 19:00:12,Twokinds,Man I'm making a lot of Spongebob references tonight.
2677,2018-02-10 19:00:45,Twokinds,What won?
2699,2018-02-10 19:01:30,Twokinds,Okay I've got a steak cooking
2703,2018-02-10 19:01:43,Twokinds,I'll be back in another 5

2724,2018-02-10 19:03:01,Twokinds,ThingsAreMoving
2730,2018-02-10 19:03:21,Twokinds,"Your name trips me up every time I glance at the chat. Because it's white, and a sentence."
2731,2018-02-10 19:03:27,Twokinds,I keep thinking someone said that.
2745,2018-02-10 19:04:07,Twokinds,"I mean, it's not a big deal. It's just... I always have to stop and realize it's your name"
2748,2018-02-10 19:04:11,Twokinds,It's so distracting
2753,2018-02-10 19:04:28,Twokinds,"Yeah, it's not okay to be white"
2780,2018-02-10 19:05:50,Twokinds,So what won for real
2790,2018-02-10 19:06:08,Twokinds,I can draw that
2839,2018-02-10 19:10:34,Twokinds,This steak is so good~
2844,2018-02-10 19:10:51,Twokinds,Burnt to perfection
2874,2018-02-10 19:12:11,Twokinds,Seasoned with mayo
2880,2018-02-10 19:12:26,Twokinds,XD
2910,2018-02-10 19:14:33,Twokinds,He's going to have an even worse cowlick in a moment
3258,2018-02-10 19:47:53,Twokinds,I don't like animals
3345,2018-02-10 19:55:21,Twokinds,done
3393,2018-02-10 19:59:55,Twokinds,Uh oh
3401,2018-02-10 20:00:14,Twokinds,I took longer than I expected. I need to get going at 8
3404,2018-02-10 20:00:23,Twokinds,Uh...
3414,2018-02-10 20:00:38,Twokinds,"I'm drawing ""Trace feels the baby kick"""
3419,2018-02-10 20:00:45,Twokinds,I'm going to run the last poll
3428,2018-02-10 20:01:16,Twokinds,Go vote!
3486,2018-02-10 20:06:14,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-MikeLewd:

3504,2018-02-10 20:06:41,Twokinds,"But unfortunately, it'll be drawn tomorrow"
3511,2018-02-10 20:06:56,Twokinds,"For now, I'm gunna head out"
3513,2018-02-10 20:07:00,Twokinds,Sorry for cutting things short
3518,2018-02-10 20:07:05,Twokinds,Hope you enjoyed it!
3531,2018-02-10 20:07:15,Twokinds,"Yes, of course"
3538,2018-02-10 20:07:19,Twokinds,I'll finish Flora
3647,2018-02-10 20:12:40,Twokinds,"Okay, I'm gunna head out! See you guys soon!"
3653,2018-02-10 20:12:49,Twokinds,Thanks for joining me tonight!
3662,2018-02-10 20:12:55,Twokinds,"Another stream tomorrow, probably"
3699,2018-02-10 20:14:47,Twokinds,AAAAAAAAAAAA
3706,2018-02-10 20:15:15,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-reniderp_flip:
3717,2018-02-10 20:17:24,Twokinds,nope!
3743,2018-02-10 20:20:48,Twokinds,"I gotta go, send me an email!"
3750,2018-02-10 20:21:17,Twokinds,"Also, I'm sorry to hear you got screwed by the gov"
3752,2018-02-10 20:21:19,Twokinds,That sucks
3961,2018-02-10 22:08:20,Twokinds,I am back!
195,2018-02-11 02:31:48,Twokinds,Opposite sides of the country pretty much
202,2018-02-11 02:36:57,Twokinds,https://youtu.be/RtWBlDC2-ss?t=20s
760,2018-02-11 22:32:11,Twokinds,HELLO

772,2018-02-11 22:37:24,Twokinds,It needs to get done this month
825,2018-02-11 22:47:50,Twokinds,This week we're gunna have Christmas in February
828,2018-02-11 22:48:08,Twokinds,I've got at least 3 christmas drawings to post xD
854,2018-02-11 22:51:25,Twokinds,And A Gift for Raine
855,2018-02-11 22:51:27,Twokinds,Nora Card
858,2018-02-11 22:51:55,Twokinds,Yes
1091,2018-02-11 23:35:59,Twokinds,Still working on book 4
1100,2018-02-11 23:38:12,Twokinds,Life's good
1101,2018-02-11 23:38:16,Twokinds,Just working working working
1102,2018-02-11 23:38:23,Twokinds,Putting away for retirement
1105,2018-02-11 23:38:43,Twokinds,I hope so!
1112,2018-02-11 23:40:41,Twokinds,"Hm, maybe not a lake."
1113,2018-02-11 23:40:46,Twokinds,Just woods.
1114,2018-02-11 23:40:55,Twokinds,I don't want too many bugs from living close to water.
1115,2018-02-11 23:41:09,Twokinds,My ideal home would be on a hill.
1134,2018-02-11 23:43:43,Twokinds,"Yeah, I just want somewhere really high up, so I can lord over my neighbors."
1140,2018-02-11 23:44:30,Twokinds,Every morning I'll go out onto my second story deck in my robe and wave to my subjects.
1153,2018-02-11 23:45:08,Twokinds,The squirrels
0,2018-02-12 00:02:02,Twokinds,California is too expensive.
11,2018-02-12 00:07:38,Twokinds,I'm sticking with Cincinnati
19,2018-02-12 00:08:52,Twokinds,Though a decent house is still 350k. A selfish part of me is kinda hoping a market correction sends housing prices down at least temporarily.
23,2018-02-12 00:10:39,Twokinds,Snow doesn't bother me because I just don't go outside when it snows.
57,2018-02-12 00:25:20,Twokinds,1 cat is too many
64,2018-02-12 00:26:34,Twokinds,I am alergic.
68,2018-02-12 00:27:23,Twokinds,I did not buy the cat.
70,2018-02-12 00:27:40,Twokinds,My mother buys all the pets.
72,2018-02-12 00:27:50,Twokinds,I would never have a pet if given the choice.
80,2018-02-12 00:29:41,Twokinds,"I don't hate animals, I just like to be alone."
89,2018-02-12 00:30:46,Twokinds,It's just extra hassle. XD
106,2018-02-12 00:33:16,Twokinds,"I can't explain it, I just love being isolated. It feels nice. :) I'm just a natural hermit."
107,2018-02-12 00:33:25,Twokinds,I swear I'm not a miserable sod.
113,2018-02-12 00:35:42,Twokinds,If the cat or squirrel paid rent I'd be happy to live with them.
122,2018-02-12 00:38:32,Twokinds,Yeah
123,2018-02-12 00:38:51,Twokinds,"I have an air filter and my roomba, but I do deal with allergies a lot too"
126,2018-02-12 00:41:23,Twokinds,"The problem is she's extremely clingy. She never leaves my room, so I'm stuck with her 24/7."
132,2018-02-12 00:42:33,Twokinds,She just came over looking for attention.
167,2018-02-12 01:11:20,Twokinds,No prob
171,2018-02-12 01:13:52,Twokinds,I'm putting together a digital artbook with all the sketches and color art from 2017 in high res.
175,2018-02-12 01:14:33,Twokinds,It'll have the names of all the patrons next to their sketches.
176,2018-02-12 01:15:07,Twokinds,"Sort of a yearbook, I guess."
180,2018-02-12 01:16:30,Twokinds,"Nope, just Book 4. I'll do the artbook after I'm done."
185,2018-02-12 01:17:52,Twokinds,"Yeah, hopefully people like it!"
190,2018-02-12 01:19:25,Twokinds,I didn't take any classes to start out.
191,2018-02-12 01:19:31,Twokinds,Though I started drawing very young.
192,2018-02-12 01:19:34,Twokinds,Uh...
193,2018-02-12 01:19:45,Twokinds,I went to college for art.
194,2018-02-12 01:19:51,Twokinds,I learned a lot there.
199,2018-02-12 01:25:13,Twokinds,Use it 100%
201,2018-02-12 01:25:40,Twokinds,Just make a collage.
204,2018-02-12 01:26:11,Twokinds,No.
205,2018-02-12 01:26:31,Twokinds,Use references as much as you can.
207,2018-02-12 01:27:05,Twokinds,No artist knows how to draw everything from memory.
208,2018-02-12 01:27:21,Twokinds,I have to look up how to draw stuff ALL the time.
211,2018-02-12 01:28:53,Twokinds,You'd never learn anything if you didn't reference anything
212,2018-02-12 01:29:04,Twokinds,It's a big part of learning to draw.
214,2018-02-12 01:29:34,Twokinds,"I wouldn't trust someone who says don't use references, or that it's cheating."
215,2018-02-12 01:29:52,Twokinds,"As long as you're not literally tracing art and calling it your own, do whatever you can to improve"
230,2018-02-12 01:47:49,Twokinds,aaaah
231,2018-02-12 01:47:53,Twokinds,There's so many typos
232,2018-02-12 01:48:16,Twokinds,I can't believe how many typos there are. It's like every page.
236,2018-02-12 01:49:02,Twokinds,That doesn't fix grammer
237,2018-02-12 01:49:12,Twokinds,And Photoshop's spellcheck is pretty primative.
238,2018-02-12 01:49:16,Twokinds,But that's not the issue
240,2018-02-12 01:49:22,Twokinds,I have all the errors listed
242,2018-02-12 01:49:29,Twokinds,I got it back from my editor
243,2018-02-12 01:49:37,Twokinds,It's just taking forever to do all the changes
249,2018-02-12 01:53:27,Twokinds,I have the master files. They just review the pages and give me a text file of the issues.
288,2018-02-12 02:11:41,Twokinds,ikidakimasu!
296,2018-02-12 02:13:04,Twokinds,Don't eat at all. That'll help you lose weight.
298,2018-02-12 02:13:20,Twokinds,All of it.
301,2018-02-12 02:14:09,Twokinds,Eh just eat less.
305,2018-02-12 02:14:27,Twokinds,Less in than out.
307,2018-02-12 02:15:12,Twokinds,Eh it's not unhealthy.
315,2018-02-12 02:17:24,Twokinds,I once only ate 1400 calories / day. Lost weight.
329,2018-02-12 02:21:28,Twokinds,"5'8"" 180. I'd like to get back down to 170."
408,2018-02-12 02:41:41,Twokinds,I finally managed to get through all the corrections.
412,2018-02-12 02:41:59,Twokinds,Well I've been working on it all day
413,2018-02-12 02:42:24,Twokinds,It's only a first pass too
414,2018-02-12 02:42:33,Twokinds,Now I'll be going back through and reading every panel
418,2018-02-12 02:44:13,Twokinds,Pretty much
419,2018-02-12 02:44:42,Twokinds,"If I have time, I'll fix up some panels I feel are a little derpy"
420,2018-02-12 02:45:13,Twokinds,"I'm not redoing any art in the comics, but if there's art flubs, I'll try to correct them."
433,2018-02-12 02:47:09,Twokinds,I'll show an example if you like
438,2018-02-12 02:52:33,Twokinds,https://www.dropbox.com/s/wfaj720gvz70574/nobleEric.png
439,2018-02-12 02:52:54,Twokinds,web v book version
441,2018-02-12 02:54:28,Twokinds,"Eric's face was a bit uneven, so it's been shifted just a little."
450,2018-02-12 02:56:23,Twokinds,"Yeah, I feel like it reads a lot better."
457,2018-02-12 02:59:28,Twokinds,All the bubbles have been changed
463,2018-02-12 03:03:27,Twokinds,My bubbles are a lot rounder these days with more padding for easier reading.
464,2018-02-12 03:03:36,Twokinds,For example:
465,2018-02-12 03:03:38,Twokinds,https://www.dropbox.com/s/ve6zmclz9sy01md/bbble.png
470,2018-02-12 03:06:12,Twokinds,"I also use bold and italics a lot more. For some reason, I was really reluctant to use it for a long time. Even when people were shouting."
471,2018-02-12 03:06:16,Twokinds,I'm not sure why.
476,2018-02-12 03:08:28,Twokinds,Well yeah.
477,2018-02-12 03:08:34,Twokinds,You don't wanna go full Miller
480,2018-02-12 03:09:21,Twokinds,That's more 90's early 2000's though
482,2018-02-12 03:09:23,Twokinds,I never got that.
486,2018-02-12 03:11:20,Twokinds,I try to be careful with it.
490,2018-02-12 03:13:25,Twokinds,Oh
495,2018-02-12 03:13:57,Twokinds,Night
498,2018-02-12 03:14:37,Twokinds,The other day I was going through some of my old files on my old PC and found something I thought was very interesting. A very early draft of chapter 11.
499,2018-02-12 03:15:05,Twokinds,"It must have been way back. A lot of it was the same, but there were some big differences too."
505,2018-02-12 03:15:55,Twokinds,"For example, Keith actually does stab himself to stop from killing Natani."
507,2018-02-12 03:16:36,Twokinds,"Natani has to go for help naked, but Laura doesn't recognize Natani, due to womanliness."
510,2018-02-12 03:17:18,Twokinds,Eric apparently was going to heal Keith(?) I guess using magic.
512,2018-02-12 03:17:39,Twokinds,He can't really do that. I can see why it was cut. Maybe a magic artifact.
516,2018-02-12 03:18:11,Twokinds,Very basic magic. Healing is hard. it's a whole school.
517,2018-02-12 03:18:17,Twokinds,You gotta get a degree and everything.
521,2018-02-12 03:19:01,Twokinds,"Anyway, then it goes on about the same"
522,2018-02-12 03:19:05,Twokinds,They take the three bridges.
524,2018-02-12 03:19:17,Twokinds,But Natani and Flora find the Arms General already dead.
526,2018-02-12 03:20:24,Twokinds,Then it's about the same. Alaric falls. The king is revealed.
527,2018-02-12 03:20:43,Twokinds,"Keith throws a dagger at the towers weak point, which destroys it."
530,2018-02-12 03:21:09,Twokinds,I... uh... can see why I changed that. It's a bit anticlimactic.
531,2018-02-12 03:22:09,Twokinds,And the chapter ends with King Adelaide dying!
537,2018-02-12 03:23:03,Twokinds,"Yeah, very different. Oriignally the conflict was that the king's life was literally tied to the tower."
538,2018-02-12 03:23:39,Twokinds,I think that's why I eventually wrote that jab about Adelaide 'tragicly surviving' later on.
542,2018-02-12 03:24:53,Twokinds,It's interesting sometimes what ends up on the cutting room floor.
543,2018-02-12 03:28:25,Twokinds,"Anyway, I am going to end up on the floor if I don't get to bed soon. G'night!"
1000,2018-02-12 20:03:16,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-floraquestion: hm?
1271,2018-02-12 21:40:53,Twokinds,I am not
1273,2018-02-12 21:41:03,Twokinds,I resent that remark
1277,2018-02-12 21:41:29,Twokinds,I type at at least a 14-year-old level.
1314,2018-02-12 21:49:27,Twokinds,Tom?
1318,2018-02-12 21:50:09,Twokinds,What's that?
1322,2018-02-12 21:50:39,Twokinds,"Ah, then yes."
1329,2018-02-12 21:51:53,Twokinds,"Yes, horrible."
1330,2018-02-12 21:51:59,Twokinds,That's why I've never used it.
1357,2018-02-12 22:01:36,Twokinds,"Thanks, Katiozi!"
1358,2018-02-12 22:01:42,Twokinds,"I'll stream tomorrow, probably, maybe"
1375,2018-02-12 22:09:36,Twokinds,What's Discord?
1384,2018-02-12 22:11:25,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
1421,2018-02-12 22:21:35,Twokinds,Who's Markiplier?
1542,2018-02-12 23:53:07,Twokinds,Some of these pages really need to be reordered...
1545,2018-02-12 23:54:23,Twokinds,Yeah. just a tiny bit
1547,2018-02-12 23:55:21,Twokinds,"There's some scene transitions, particularly with Mike and Evals' gender adventures, that are really sudden, because they're just sorta randomly scattered throughout the chapter."
1549,2018-02-12 23:55:47,Twokinds,"So like, on the left page, you have Alabaster saying Keith has ""ONE HOUR!"" and then on the right, it's Heartbutt Mike."
1550,2018-02-12 23:56:04,Twokinds,"And it's like, wow, this is sudden, since it's the first time Mike's shown up in the book."
1553,2018-02-12 23:57:12,Twokinds,"Yeah, so I'm just going to move that page and the next one with Mike and Evals to a good transition point a few pages back."
1554,2018-02-12 23:57:41,Twokinds,It's a very minor sort order and doesn't change the order of events any.
1557,2018-02-12 23:59:00,Twokinds,Of course
1558,2018-02-12 23:59:12,Twokinds,I go through and I check to see which pages end up on the left and right
1559,2018-02-12 23:59:17,Twokinds,I try to make sure it flows well
0,2018-02-13 00:00:28,Twokinds,It's way easier to get away with transitions online since it's 1 page at a time
3,2018-02-13 00:01:45,Twokinds,"Yes, a lot"
4,2018-02-13 00:03:05,Twokinds,"One thing I try very hard to make sure, is that when there's something dramatic happening, it happens after a pageturn."
5,2018-02-13 00:03:33,Twokinds,"So it's like ""And then suddenly!"" and then you have to turn the page to see Adelaide appear in the courtroom, or the tower blow up, etc"
7,2018-02-13 00:04:23,Twokinds,Exactly
9,2018-02-13 00:04:55,Twokinds,"Or like if there's a flashback, I like to have it start on the left page. So that both left and right pages are black bordered."
10,2018-02-13 00:06:04,Twokinds,"Luckily, since a lot of stuff is going on at once, usually, and there's just one-off pages with Mike and Evals or whatever, it's very easy to just shift one page without changing the order of events."
11,2018-02-13 00:06:17,Twokinds,And I only do that if absolutely necessary for a dramatic reveal or whatever.
14,2018-02-13 00:07:46,Twokinds,"Yeah, obviously I can't shift the page where they spot the tower exploding"
15,2018-02-13 00:08:07,Twokinds,"I probably put more thought into it than I should, but this is why the books take so long."
25,2018-02-13 00:11:54,Twokinds,"When you do things right, people will think I am a god. I think that's how the saying goes."
29,2018-02-13 00:12:44,Twokinds,"Yeah, I'm very close to being done."
30,2018-02-13 00:13:02,Twokinds,I am just going over the book for any obvious mistakes before handing it off to my proofreaders
39,2018-02-13 00:16:25,Twokinds,"Uh, it's like Sage, and stuff"
40,2018-02-13 00:16:35,Twokinds,Mostly Sage.

76,2018-02-13 00:25:07,Twokinds,"Er, well, not formatting wise."

84,2018-02-13 00:27:53,Twokinds,You know what's weird to think about? Book 4 starts in 2008. And 2008 is when I was redoing the first pages in color for Book 1.
85,2018-02-13 00:28:30,Twokinds,"So in 2008 I was thinking about how much of an idiot I was in 2003 and redoing that work, and now I'm here thinking how much of an idiot I was in 2008, redoing his work."
88,2018-02-13 00:29:12,Twokinds,"Then like in 2022, I'm gunna be thinking ""man 2018 Tom was an idiot"" and redoing his work."
90,2018-02-13 00:30:22,Twokinds,"In 2114, when I become a perfect, immortal machine."

3675,2018-02-17 19:53:16,Twokinds,Start thinking about which ones you want in color
3707,2018-02-17 19:54:17,Twokinds,Now I gotta do tax stuff....
3721,2018-02-17 19:55:11,Twokinds,Not messy. It's just a standard 1040
3728,2018-02-17 19:55:58,Twokinds,"But yeah, as a self employed person, things can get complicated. And I never get anything back."
3729,2018-02-17 19:56:02,Twokinds,I always just pay and pay.
3734,2018-02-17 19:56:27,Twokinds,"In fact I pay twice, since I am both employee and employer"
3737,2018-02-17 19:56:35,Twokinds,There's a whole self employment tax on top.
3738,2018-02-17 19:56:43,Twokinds,No.
3745,2018-02-17 19:57:17,Twokinds,BUT! I also can do things like contribute to a 401k as both employee and employer
3746,2018-02-17 19:57:20,Twokinds,Which is pretty sweet.
3758,2018-02-17 19:58:40,Twokinds,"Also, I recently found out I can still contribute to a SEP-IRA for 2017 until April which is fantastic."

3762,2018-02-17 19:58:53,Twokinds,Darn it. How did this happen.
3774,2018-02-17 19:59:33,Twokinds,"But yeah, investing in retirement is nice because it reduces my taxable income."
3782,2018-02-17 20:00:24,Twokinds,"SEP-IRA is another type of retirement fund. It's a US thing, so it's understandable you aren't aware."
3806,2018-02-17 20:03:36,Twokinds,No prob!
3816,2018-02-17 20:11:09,Twokinds,401k loan?
3818,2018-02-17 20:13:05,Twokinds,That sounds dangerous.
3822,2018-02-17 20:13:58,Twokinds,Ooooh
3823,2018-02-17 20:14:02,Twokinds,I see what you're saying
3828,2018-02-17 20:14:29,Twokinds,"Yeah I was going to say, I would not take a loan out of my retirement fund."

442,2018-02-19 23:56:31,Twokinds,Feel pretty accomplished.
443,2018-02-19 23:56:47,Twokinds,Vol 4 almost done
446,2018-02-19 23:57:48,Twokinds,Yeah I got all the proofing back
447,2018-02-19 23:57:51,Twokinds,"Thanks for that, btw!"
452,2018-02-19 23:59:11,Twokinds,Yeah I have
2,2018-02-20 00:00:25,Twokinds,lol
3,2018-02-20 00:00:47,Twokinds,I don't like paperwork. But I do like tax deductions!
4,2018-02-20 00:01:01,Twokinds,And numbers going up.
5,2018-02-20 00:01:04,Twokinds,That's why I like RPGs.
14,2018-02-20 00:04:34,Twokinds,"Finances are just rpg irl. Just gotta grind, and use the systems to automate the process."

36,2018-02-20 00:12:47,Twokinds,So sad.
55,2018-02-20 00:17:47,Twokinds,The server mods are pretty strict on cheaters.
86,2018-02-20 00:26:08,Twokinds,Indeed it is.
391,2018-02-20 01:25:45,Twokinds,:no_mouth: Alllways watching
421,2018-02-20 01:34:13,Twokinds,Do you think Basitin and Keidran should be lower or uppercase
445,2018-02-20 01:39:40,Twokinds,But you uppercase natonality. So a basitin is also a Basitin.
447,2018-02-20 01:40:04,Twokinds,"Grammatically, it should be context sensitive, but in practicality, it's just weird to see it seemingly randomly changing case all the time."
456,2018-02-20 01:41:24,Twokinds,I prefer it uppercase...
464,2018-02-20 01:44:04,Twokinds,Hm
505,2018-02-20 01:55:47,Twokinds,But like...
510,2018-02-20 01:57:03,Twokinds,"When characters say ""The Keidran"" ""That Keidran""... is it not like saying ""The Brit"" ""That Swede"""
517,2018-02-20 01:59:55,Twokinds,But... Brit and Yank are capitalized.
525,2018-02-20 02:01:44,Twokinds,Eugh
526,2018-02-20 02:01:49,Twokinds,"I dunno, I don't care enough"
532,2018-02-20 02:03:10,Twokinds,"Any time it's wrong, the character is just referring to their race/nationality, whichever is right."
534,2018-02-20 02:03:31,Twokinds,Problem solved.
546,2018-02-20 02:06:28,Twokinds,"What about a keidran who's nationality is Basitin? They are a Basitin, but not a basitin."
558,2018-02-20 02:08:19,Twokinds,You know what? This is why a lot of comics are in all caps.
562,2018-02-20 02:09:07,Twokinds,THE BASITIN FROM THE BASTIN ISLAND IS A BASITIN.
563,2018-02-20 02:09:12,Twokinds,THERE I FIXED IT
572,2018-02-20 02:09:53,Twokinds,"I get what's right, I just don't wanna do the work :P"
578,2018-02-20 02:10:26,Twokinds,"Anyway, Book 4 is pretty much done now"

585,2018-02-20 02:11:01,Twokinds,Just a little extra

644,2018-02-20 02:28:26,Twokinds,Nope kids are extra points
666,2018-02-20 02:36:16,Twokinds,It wasn't
672,2018-02-20 02:45:41,Twokinds,"It wasn't removed, it was lost and no one told me."
676,2018-02-20 02:47:01,Twokinds,"Most changes like that aren't because I'm maliciously changing things. It's because the process was automated, and the photoshop file long ago wasn't saved after a change was made between the jpg and psd."
679,2018-02-20 02:48:24,Twokinds,So something like tail wagging or blood added last minute that wasn't saved and caused a discrepensy and people don't tell me it's different so I never fix it.
682,2018-02-20 02:49:37,Twokinds,"I see the issue. The original jpg has a tail wagging, but the original psd doesn't have a tail there"
683,2018-02-20 02:50:26,Twokinds,I must have put it in last minute and put it in right before saving it as a jpg but forgot to save the updated psd.
686,2018-02-20 02:51:11,Twokinds,Alaric's statue

697,2018-02-20 02:56:36,Twokinds,Yeah but books are ordered in bulk.
698,2018-02-20 02:56:50,Twokinds,It'd have to be on another printing run.

195,2018-02-23 00:32:31,Twokinds,I've had them for a long long time
201,2018-02-23 00:32:53,Twokinds,I just keep them cause I don't want to buy a new pair
207,2018-02-23 00:33:27,Twokinds,Buying a new pair would be like $20!

2735,2018-02-24 20:12:25,Twokinds,I was going to title it something like that but couldn't make the pun work
2737,2018-02-24 20:12:44,Twokinds,Hit (on) [in] the showers? Doesn't work
3122,2018-02-24 23:06:03,Twokinds,Uh... I think she's around 9?
3123,2018-02-24 23:06:11,Twokinds,I actually can't remember exactly.

9,2018-02-25 00:11:10,Twokinds,I did read the script
10,2018-02-25 00:11:19,Twokinds,I'd have to compile my thoughts about it
19,2018-02-25 00:14:04,Twokinds,"Uh, I don't know about papercraft"
28,2018-02-25 00:15:32,Twokinds,I feel like the script is a bit.. how shall I say... one note
29,2018-02-25 00:16:43,Twokinds,And it feels as though the whole story is written to make the ending work.
38,2018-02-25 00:21:44,Twokinds,"I just feel like like, with pixie panic 2, there should be a lot of interesting stuff going on"
39,2018-02-25 00:22:04,Twokinds,"And... well... ""everyone's a girl!"" is... well, it's just one thing..."
45,2018-02-25 00:24:54,Twokinds,"When I think ""queen of the pixies"" I'm sorta thinking ""siren"""
54,2018-02-25 00:27:13,Twokinds,"Yeah not literally a merefolk, but like, a unique aquatic humanoid creature that ensnares men"
55,2018-02-25 00:27:23,Twokinds,Kinda the reverse of what you wrote honestly XD
60,2018-02-25 00:30:23,Twokinds,Sorry I can tell it was a lot of work. I just feel like there should be more interesting stuff.
63,2018-02-25 00:32:13,Twokinds,"Pixie Panic was really just an excuse to have all the characters go through a bunch of weird magical stuff. I think if I were to make a sequel, it'd need to fulfill a similiar purpose."
64,2018-02-25 00:32:16,Twokinds,If that makes sense.
67,2018-02-25 00:33:21,Twokinds,"Having a different plot and setting is good, but at least for me, I like having fun stuff going on throughout."
68,2018-02-25 00:33:29,Twokinds,I like the idea of an island.
69,2018-02-25 00:33:38,Twokinds,Can't be all ship corridors again.
70,2018-02-25 00:33:55,Twokinds,As much as that makes it easy to draw...
75,2018-02-25 00:35:09,Twokinds,Ever play dragon age?
79,2018-02-25 00:36:01,Twokinds,There's a sequence when all the characters are trapped in the fade and they're all experiencing a dream or nightmare constructed for me.
81,2018-02-25 00:36:36,Twokinds,That's a concept I've been toying with to delve further into the characters.
82,2018-02-25 00:37:19,Twokinds,And have the group going into each fantasy relm to retrieve a trapped character could lead to some fun situations.
87,2018-02-25 00:38:24,Twokinds,Yeah. Or it could be their ideal world that turns into a nightmare.
89,2018-02-25 00:39:25,Twokinds,"I'm picturing Eric surrounded by busy keidran, and the cast that enters his dream turn into busty women as well."
90,2018-02-25 00:40:16,Twokinds,"And then it turns into a nightmare when all the keidran turn into kat and Eric has to reject them all, and the real kat is insulted XD"
94,2018-02-25 00:41:11,Twokinds,lol
95,2018-02-25 00:41:16,Twokinds,"Yeah. You know, something like that."
99,2018-02-25 00:43:47,Twokinds,"I dunno. Like I said, still toying with that concept."
101,2018-02-25 00:43:55,Twokinds,I'm not sure if anything will come of it.

208,2018-02-25 01:50:53,Twokinds,Maybe I'd be a Radiation Tech in a hospital somewhere?
209,2018-02-25 01:51:39,Twokinds,Who knows.
211,2018-02-25 01:52:51,Twokinds,I started Twokinds so young that I didn't have any other plans for my future.

220,2018-02-25 01:54:42,Twokinds,Probably tried other comic ideas sooner.
222,2018-02-25 01:54:59,Twokinds,Most likely. that's the real answer.

224,2018-02-25 01:55:14,Twokinds,Comics were almost inevitable.

358,2018-03-14 04:00:03,Twokinds,Thanks
359,2018-03-14 04:00:05,Twokinds,G'night
0,2018-03-15 00:48:57,Twokinds,I came across webcomics for the first time in 1999 and really wanted to make one myself after getting hooked on them.
1,2018-03-15 00:48:59,Twokinds,So I did
7,2018-03-15 01:35:08,Twokinds,The first webcomic I read had an anthro cat. I wanted to make something like that.
9,2018-03-15 01:36:45,Twokinds,"The internet was a lot more primative back then, so it was hard to find stuff. I didn't know about furries or anything like that until well after I started drawing them."
12,2018-03-15 01:39:05,Twokinds,Probably not.
14,2018-03-15 01:40:40,Twokinds,There were other 'furry' comics back then. But most were just ALL anthro characters. I wanted a story with humans and anthros together.
15,2018-03-15 01:40:50,Twokinds,So I made Twokinds.
19,2018-03-15 01:42:13,Twokinds,lol
20,2018-03-15 01:42:37,Twokinds,Yeah
24,2018-03-15 01:44:44,Twokinds,"They don't have a lot of differences, other than their legs."
27,2018-03-15 01:45:33,Twokinds,I think digitigrade legs just look better. Human feet on animal characters like Sonic just look WRONG. To me.
219,2018-03-15 20:16:00,Twokinds,I'm busy. I'll stream when I'm able
387,2018-03-15 20:43:23,Twokinds,sorry brb

464,2018-03-15 20:51:55,Twokinds,"If you hadn't noticed, the fireplace isn't even partially done yet"
656,2018-03-15 21:19:57,Twokinds,"You just know even if Stan Lee passes away, he'll still somehow keep showing up in Marvel movies.."

1661,2018-03-15 23:32:09,Twokinds,Okay
1663,2018-03-15 23:32:22,Twokinds,I think I'm going to save the rest of this for later.
1698,2018-03-15 23:36:38,Twokinds,So sad that today's internet youths have no concept of culture!
1704,2018-03-15 23:37:20,Twokinds,"It is clearly Trogdor the Burninator, burninating the countryside."
1787,2018-03-15 23:49:00,Twokinds,Sorry I'm about out of juice at the moment
1789,2018-03-15 23:49:13,Twokinds,I think I'm about done. Afraid I'm going to need to call it a little early

41,2018-03-17 13:46:41,Twokinds,People really need to learn to use capitalization more.
44,2018-03-17 13:51:15,Twokinds,I assume it's because they're making the suggestion on a phone
45,2018-03-17 13:52:07,Twokinds,We have some good suggestions this week
53,2018-03-17 13:58:22,Twokinds,No more Daniels and Therie! X_x It's too much. I'm gunna have to call a kibosh on that soon.
56,2018-03-17 13:58:45,Twokinds,"I'm glad people like it, but there's just a little too much bandwagoning going on."
59,2018-03-17 14:00:11,Twokinds,I just like good ideas.
62,2018-03-17 14:00:58,Twokinds,No it's not. My opinions are objective facts.
89,2018-03-17 14:24:29,Twokinds,I'm going to miss a good chunk of the stream as well.
90,2018-03-17 14:24:36,Twokinds,That's life though.

5307,2018-03-17 21:53:00,Twokinds,"College for me was very casual. I too two classes every week, usually on the same day. So I only went to college once a week."

5319,2018-03-17 21:54:44,Twokinds,"But like, it didn't really matter. I prefer less workload and longer time in college, than the opposite of that."
5322,2018-03-17 21:55:02,Twokinds,And it didn't cost any more.
5344,2018-03-17 21:58:04,Twokinds,haha

33,2018-03-18 00:26:39,Twokinds,My mother is the type of person who just likes to buy stuff
34,2018-03-18 00:26:43,Twokinds,"And at the time, it was pets"
36,2018-03-18 00:26:53,Twokinds,She also bought me a fish and two hamsters
41,2018-03-18 00:27:14,Twokinds,And a puppy
43,2018-03-18 00:27:22,Twokinds,And four other puppies
49,2018-03-18 00:27:45,Twokinds,Nope. We still have most of the dogs.
50,2018-03-18 00:28:02,Twokinds,She has four dogs now.

59,2018-03-18 00:28:54,Twokinds,because I just couldn't take care of a dog.
63,2018-03-18 00:29:34,Twokinds,Yeah
68,2018-03-18 00:30:15,Twokinds,Thankfully she's sworn off pets now
73,2018-03-18 00:30:36,Twokinds,Yes. She's a thrifter now.
76,2018-03-18 00:30:56,Twokinds,She buys and sells junk she finds at flea markets hoping she'll find that million dollar painting.
78,2018-03-18 00:31:18,Twokinds,She brought in a fax machine the other day asking me if it was valuable.
86,2018-03-18 00:32:12,Twokinds,She's the type of person that spends anything she gets.
90,2018-03-18 00:32:35,Twokinds,I'm thankful I ended up the opposite of that.
98,2018-03-18 00:33:57,Twokinds,I'm playing Infinifactory

197,2018-03-18 00:54:05,Twokinds,It's just... really packed houses that are narrow from the front
198,2018-03-18 00:54:18,Twokinds,Every house is like that near Cincinnati

215,2018-03-18 00:58:16,Twokinds,They all look like that. Square. Close together.
224,2018-03-18 00:59:15,Twokinds,Well it was built 100 years ago
229,2018-03-18 00:59:31,Twokinds,That's how all the houses are near the city. Pretty much.
233,2018-03-18 00:59:51,Twokinds,"When I move, it'll be outside Cinci."
236,2018-03-18 01:00:18,Twokinds,I only need to be close enough to get good internet.
238,2018-03-18 01:00:32,Twokinds,And Amazon Prime Now would be a plus. But I doubt it.
377,2018-03-18 01:42:16,Twokinds,"Nora, when she's a horse"
385,2018-03-18 01:42:51,Twokinds,There's no naturally sapient hooved people though
716,2018-03-18 02:46:09,Twokinds,I'm gunna go to bed too soon
719,2018-03-18 02:46:26,Twokinds,As soon as my bed heater heats up.
726,2018-03-18 02:48:53,Twokinds,lol
727,2018-03-18 02:49:00,Twokinds,I just hate getting into a cold bed
731,2018-03-18 02:49:53,Twokinds,"It used to be, I had a bed in an attic and it got REALLY cold. It was misery. Now, I don't put up with that."
732,2018-03-18 02:49:58,Twokinds,"Warm bed, all the time."
740,2018-03-18 02:51:57,Twokinds,"Well, there were some hard times back then."
743,2018-03-18 02:52:58,Twokinds,"It's complicated, but we had to put up with a lot of moving around for a while."
744,2018-03-18 02:53:14,Twokinds,Lotta downsizing.
749,2018-03-18 02:53:55,Twokinds,My cat hasn't slept in my bed since her first year
750,2018-03-18 02:54:09,Twokinds,I think I kicked her in my sleep once and it's scared her off ever since.
755,2018-03-18 02:54:38,Twokinds,lol

857,2018-03-18 15:24:51,Twokinds,"Ah, I forgot there was text on it"
860,2018-03-18 16:20:45,Twokinds,Hello!
868,2018-03-18 17:01:36,Twokinds,I never nap
869,2018-03-18 17:01:44,Twokinds,Naps are always bad for me.
873,2018-03-18 17:12:25,Twokinds,That's always been my experience
874,2018-03-18 17:12:38,Twokinds,Naps just throw everything off. I think it's something you have to make a habit of
875,2018-03-18 17:12:52,Twokinds,"Like, if you nap at the same time for a week or two, you get used to it."
876,2018-03-18 17:13:11,Twokinds,But I don't want to end up dependant on naps.
877,2018-03-18 17:13:28,Twokinds,Cause then you'd just feel awful when you have to disrupt that cycle.
956,2018-03-18 17:46:42,Twokinds,I just go to bed at night and fall asleep and then wake up the next day.
959,2018-03-18 17:47:02,Twokinds,"More like... bed planning, am I right?"
973,2018-03-18 17:57:45,Twokinds,"If I planned my sleeps, I wouldn't be going to bed at 4am most nights."

976,2018-03-18 17:58:29,Twokinds,I'm the loser on the highway going exactly the speed limit on cruise.
1041,2018-03-18 18:10:38,Twokinds,The thought of being pulled over scares me a lot.
1049,2018-03-18 18:12:18,Twokinds,Not that I know of. I just don't deal with unexpected human contact well.
1052,2018-03-18 18:12:39,Twokinds,I live right next to the police/fire department actually.
1056,2018-03-18 18:13:02,Twokinds,"Like, it's literally right across from our neighborhood. And it's a pretty chill community."
1058,2018-03-18 18:13:55,Twokinds,Nah
1059,2018-03-18 18:14:06,Twokinds,Do I seem like the type that would? XD
1062,2018-03-18 18:14:32,Twokinds,"But it's a very safe area. It should be, our local taxes are extremely high."
1068,2018-03-18 18:17:37,Twokinds,I'm considering just ubering full-time. It probably wouldn't be that much more expensive.
1080,2018-03-18 18:20:15,Twokinds,"Well yeah, that's humanity."
1105,2018-03-18 18:24:30,Twokinds,"Yes, I'd like to request one uber, extra no talking."
1110,2018-03-18 18:24:57,Twokinds,They should have that as an option in the app.
1117,2018-03-18 18:25:30,Twokinds,Just   :ballot_box_with_check:Silence
1138,2018-03-18 18:28:43,Twokinds,mmm mystery food delivery
1144,2018-03-18 18:29:08,Twokinds,The food of the day is Indian spicy chicken curry.
1153,2018-03-18 18:30:48,Twokinds,"Mmm, it's good"
1154,2018-03-18 18:31:17,Twokinds,"Indian curry is quite different from the Korean or Japanese curries I usually have, but I like it."
1158,2018-03-18 18:34:15,Twokinds,"Oh, it's very hard to explain. It's more... savory? Thicker, with like, carrots and potatoes. More like a curry stew, put on rice. At least the type my mother makes."
1159,2018-03-18 18:34:21,Twokinds,I'm sure there's other types.
1167,2018-03-18 18:39:12,Twokinds,"It's pretty easy. You can just get it in a box, it's called Golden Curry"
1169,2018-03-18 18:39:39,Twokinds,That's what my mother uses. You just melt it and start mixing in your stuff.
1171,2018-03-18 18:40:21,Twokinds,"Curry is meant to be pretty easy by design. It's just stuff, put on rice."
1178,2018-03-18 18:41:54,Twokinds,"One thing I really like about Indian food is they're not afraid to get spicy. In a good way. Hot, but still tastes good."
1186,2018-03-18 18:43:17,Twokinds,lol sorry for all the food talk XD
1189,2018-03-18 18:43:28,Twokinds,"Can't help it, I love curry."
1323,2018-03-18 19:09:04,Twokinds,I don't like sand snakes.
1326,2018-03-18 19:09:38,Twokinds,They're coarse and rough and irritating and they get everywhere.
1340,2018-03-18 19:23:10,Twokinds,"I legit came back and just read ""I like how he goes butt first"" and was really confused."
1349,2018-03-18 19:26:36,Twokinds,lol
1350,2018-03-18 19:26:43,Twokinds,"Very apt, yes."
1398,2018-03-18 19:44:55,Twokinds,I love white chocolate!
76,2018-03-19 03:06:04,Twokinds,What do humans do for fun
95,2018-03-19 03:42:54,Twokinds,no I meant in real life
96,2018-03-19 03:43:23,Twokinds,A friend of mine asked me what I wanted to do in Atlanta. But I don't know what people do.
103,2018-03-19 03:50:39,Twokinds,lol
104,2018-03-19 03:50:52,Twokinds,Aquarium is exactly what they suggested.
107,2018-03-19 03:51:12,Twokinds,They have panthers at the aquarium?
110,2018-03-19 03:51:45,Twokinds,I don't know what anyone does for fun.
113,2018-03-19 03:52:49,Twokinds,I suggested skydiving but they said that's not a normal thing people casually do.
118,2018-03-19 03:54:09,Twokinds,"A lot of things I think of are physical, like rock climbing, but not everyone can participate in something like that."
119,2018-03-19 03:55:31,Twokinds,"I like bowling, but do people bowl anymore? I don't even know."
123,2018-03-19 03:56:48,Twokinds,"Now I'm wondering if Wii Bowling had a noticable impact on Bowling alleys, up or down."
127,2018-03-19 03:57:22,Twokinds,bigly
151,2018-03-19 04:19:15,Twokinds,Nope. Nothing came of it. Yes...
154,2018-03-19 04:20:01,Twokinds,"In the end, I couldn't come up with a story."

269,2018-03-19 16:33:27,Twokinds,Who should be on the 2018 signature print?
271,2018-03-19 16:35:14,Twokinds,Flora Natani Kathrin
276,2018-03-19 16:38:29,Twokinds,Raine's a good possibility
188,2018-03-20 20:02:56,Twokinds,"Today's comic stream is postponed until tomorrow, same time. I apologise."
196,2018-03-20 20:03:29,Twokinds,"Yesterday was my mother's birthday so I was out of the house and not drawing, unfortunately."
203,2018-03-20 20:03:57,Twokinds,Wasn't able to do the comic prep work I usually do on Tuesdays.
213,2018-03-20 20:04:47,Twokinds,lol
244,2018-03-20 20:07:33,Twokinds,She can paint
195,2018-03-21 02:14:55,Twokinds,I wonder if I could watch all of Game of Thrones and Westworld in 7 days...
202,2018-03-21 02:22:13,Twokinds,"Well, the HBO free trial is only 7 days"
203,2018-03-21 02:22:31,Twokinds,and I don't want to pay money for it
212,2018-03-21 02:25:44,Twokinds,I'm more interested in Westworld so that's what I'll probably do.
214,2018-03-21 02:29:40,Twokinds,It's 10 hours long. I could watch it on one sitting.
219,2018-03-21 02:36:11,Twokinds,I have an obsessive personality.
239,2018-03-21 02:51:55,Twokinds,I have game screencaps too
241,2018-03-21 02:52:28,Twokinds,http://twokindscomic.com/images/tomsgameskillz.png
246,2018-03-21 02:53:31,Twokinds,"Rimworld. First thing I did was tame a squirrel, after finding out I could."
251,2018-03-21 02:56:13,Twokinds,I don't have time. And I'm not really into realistic fantasy.
253,2018-03-21 02:56:59,Twokinds,"Well, gritty fantasy, for lack of a better term."
254,2018-03-21 02:57:11,Twokinds,Same reason I never watched Game of Thrones.
258,2018-03-21 02:58:58,Twokinds,2018 Signature Print on the way
259,2018-03-21 02:59:07,Twokinds,http://twokindscomic.com/images/2017signatureprint_preview.png
264,2018-03-21 03:01:40,Twokinds,"Usually, they're just for conventions. They're something I sign for $5, if people just want something small and not a book or whatever."
269,2018-03-21 03:02:42,Twokinds,"Yeah, I usually bring a small number of the old ones to cons, if people want to have the whole series"
271,2018-03-21 03:03:01,Twokinds,Thanks!
280,2018-03-21 03:04:51,Twokinds,Yeah
281,2018-03-21 03:05:01,Twokinds,That's my primary convention
315,2018-03-21 03:14:34,Twokinds,lol it's just a sketch right now
333,2018-03-21 03:22:31,Twokinds,Or make it a lenticular print! With the human version and wolf version showing up depending on the angle you hold it!
336,2018-03-21 03:23:28,Twokinds,But then I couldn't sign it
348,2018-03-21 03:26:56,Twokinds,It'd be all bumpy
350,2018-03-21 03:27:11,Twokinds,"You know, it's all angles. It'd be quite hard to write on with anything."
353,2018-03-21 03:28:20,Twokinds,lpol
354,2018-03-21 03:28:29,Twokinds,lol
367,2018-03-21 03:30:21,Twokinds,Maybe i'll just make a seperate print series
371,2018-03-21 03:32:01,Twokinds,"Then I could do one where Raine turns into a wolf, one where Mike turns into a girl, etc"
386,2018-03-21 03:35:17,Twokinds,I'm headed to bed
387,2018-03-21 03:35:19,Twokinds,G'night!

996,2018-03-21 20:14:44,Twokinds,20
1022,2018-03-21 20:16:49,Twokinds,I'm 40
1351,2018-03-21 21:00:52,Twokinds,Ngh...
1354,2018-03-21 21:01:03,Twokinds,These are the last couple pages of the chapter. I'd like to get them correct.
1363,2018-03-21 21:01:30,Twokinds,Yeah I need more time
1368,2018-03-21 21:01:46,Twokinds,2 or 3 more pages.
1377,2018-03-21 21:02:27,Twokinds,Depending on how long the last ominous conversation lasts.
1398,2018-03-21 21:03:50,Twokinds,"Good, I suppose."
1403,2018-03-21 21:04:20,Twokinds,12
1431,2018-03-21 21:06:51,Twokinds,"People anticipating the stream, and being disappointed when the page isn't ready yet, has caused me so much stress."
1441,2018-03-21 21:07:20,Twokinds,"I have to cancel it on an official capacity. There'll be a comic stream each week, but when it is, I'm not going to say."
1456,2018-03-21 21:08:20,Twokinds,It'll just be smoother if I could do the comic stream whenever I need to.
1462,2018-03-21 21:08:37,Twokinds,"Then I can do it on Tuesday if it's ready early, or thursday, if it's late, etc"
1470,2018-03-21 21:09:00,Twokinds,"Afraid not, sorry."
1472,2018-03-21 21:09:11,Twokinds,I don't want to rush it out just for the sake of the stream.
1504,2018-03-21 21:14:23,Twokinds,Why?
1566,2018-03-21 21:21:27,Twokinds,I don't do animations
1569,2018-03-21 21:21:42,Twokinds,I'm not creative enough to make stuff like that
1571,2018-03-21 21:21:55,Twokinds,Eh
1573,2018-03-21 21:22:01,Twokinds,I'm fine here
1613,2018-03-21 21:26:01,Twokinds,"If I had a million dollars, I probably still wouldn't. My love is comics."
1622,2018-03-21 21:27:20,Twokinds,"I would, however, update more often XD"
1639,2018-03-21 21:28:43,Twokinds,"If I had a million dollars, I would hire someone to help bounce ideas off of, and an inker to speed things up a little."
1640,2018-03-21 21:28:48,Twokinds,And put out three pages a week.
1645,2018-03-21 21:29:06,Twokinds,3 pages is realistic.
1672,2018-03-21 21:33:46,Twokinds,Yeah
1674,2018-03-21 21:33:55,Twokinds,Sometimes it's hard being the only one running everything.
1675,2018-03-21 21:34:02,Twokinds,I feel like I'm always putting out fires.
1680,2018-03-21 21:34:48,Twokinds,I wish I could afford to take the pressure off a little.
1684,2018-03-21 21:35:00,Twokinds,It's why I've been looking for side writers.
1700,2018-03-21 21:36:34,Twokinds,I was 16.
1706,2018-03-21 21:36:54,Twokinds,"Well, technically, I was 13 when I made the first Twokinds website."
1710,2018-03-21 21:37:13,Twokinds,But it took me a few years to learn to draw.
1723,2018-03-21 21:38:47,Twokinds,I had to learn how to write html
1728,2018-03-21 21:39:06,Twokinds,But that wasn't too hard. I'd been writing qbasic since I was 9.
1761,2018-03-21 21:42:11,Twokinds,"Well, there'll always been more twokinds, so I guess you'll just have to live forever."
1768,2018-03-21 21:42:54,Twokinds,I can't die. I'm asian.
1780,2018-03-21 21:43:46,Twokinds,Yes
1799,2018-03-21 21:46:13,Twokinds,I've been to cons in Florida
1801,2018-03-21 21:46:20,Twokinds,I was at one a few years ago with Ron
1803,2018-03-21 21:46:30,Twokinds,A couple times
1804,2018-03-21 21:46:38,Twokinds,I don't go to a lot of cons.
1810,2018-03-21 21:47:18,Twokinds,"Although, it's looking like I might be going to anthrocon this year. Which is scary."
1816,2018-03-21 21:47:46,Twokinds,"I've never been to a ""fur"" con."
1830,2018-03-21 21:48:47,Twokinds,lol
436,2018-03-22 20:21:15,Twokinds,what up

462,2018-03-22 20:25:12,Twokinds,awesfull
469,2018-03-22 20:26:09,Twokinds,It means streama time
680,2018-03-22 20:46:10,Twokinds,It's just showing the time I ended on last stream
700,2018-03-22 20:47:57,Twokinds,"it's... hours and minutes, not time..."
714,2018-03-22 20:49:54,Twokinds,It doesn't matter
730,2018-03-22 20:51:19,Twokinds,I hate drawing tiny people
836,2018-03-22 20:59:21,Twokinds,This is actually the first time old wolf Euchre has been in the comic since page 242
850,2018-03-22 20:59:53,Twokinds,"That was January 31, 2006"
1348,2018-03-22 21:41:58,Twokinds,you only awoo once
1370,2018-03-22 21:42:49,Twokinds,awoo another day
1376,2018-03-22 21:43:09,Twokinds,"don't ask for whom the wolf awoos, it awoos for thee"

2575,2018-03-22 23:14:12,Twokinds,I feel like I've already gone over the calendar system here before
2711,2018-03-22 23:23:47,Twokinds,True true
2719,2018-03-22 23:24:15,Twokinds,But still you can kinda see how Rose would be mad about the whole... about to be hanged angle.
2725,2018-03-22 23:24:28,Twokinds,And the... you still work for those guys who were going to hang me thing.
2739,2018-03-22 23:25:21,Twokinds,Well it all worked out :)
3085,2018-03-22 23:57:17,Twokinds,What does she know that she shouldn't?
55,2018-03-23 00:06:43,Twokinds,I'm done
73,2018-03-23 00:07:46,Twokinds,She's looking to the right
111,2018-03-23 00:10:11,Twokinds,It's a print that's signed
120,2018-03-23 00:10:37,Twokinds,I'm looking into having it included in the preorders for Vol 4
122,2018-03-23 00:10:40,Twokinds,As a bonus
127,2018-03-23 00:10:50,Twokinds,"Yes, signed"
132,2018-03-23 00:10:59,Twokinds,It's the only way I can get anything signed into the preorder

146,2018-03-23 00:11:41,Twokinds,I'm not sure and I'm not sure
148,2018-03-23 00:11:53,Twokinds,The preorder was going to be this week but people at Keenspot are sick
149,2018-03-23 00:11:59,Twokinds,Something is going around
163,2018-03-23 00:12:23,Twokinds,Digital signature
169,2018-03-23 00:13:08,Twokinds,Believe me signing just one thing for each preorder is a blessing.
173,2018-03-23 00:13:29,Twokinds,"Anyway, I'm done for tonight"
177,2018-03-23 00:13:40,Twokinds,Gunna format the comic and put it up
193,2018-03-23 00:13:59,Twokinds,unsteddy you're already getting it

618,2018-03-23 01:56:18,Twokinds,ok
658,2018-03-23 02:06:55,Twokinds,So confusing seeing people talk about someone named holly
663,2018-03-23 02:07:22,Twokinds,Holly is the name of my cat.
669,2018-03-23 02:09:14,Twokinds,Hey!

906,2018-03-23 17:00:28,Twokinds,Sometimes I forget
912,2018-03-23 17:02:57,Twokinds,I have a table at SDCC and possibly anthrocon
919,2018-03-23 17:05:11,Twokinds,"It's a print, that I signature in 2018"
922,2018-03-23 17:05:30,Twokinds,"Prints are usually physical, yes"
933,2018-03-23 17:07:33,Twokinds,I like to have something small that someone can get at a con that doesn't cost as much as a book
934,2018-03-23 17:07:37,Twokinds,But is still something to have

946,2018-03-23 17:11:40,Twokinds,Raine is too floofy
950,2018-03-23 17:12:34,Twokinds,"I wonder if, when Raine sheds, and then turns back... does the shed fur disappear?"
951,2018-03-23 17:12:39,Twokinds,Does it stay?
962,2018-03-23 17:15:21,Twokinds,"When Raine's cut as a wolf, the injury goes away when she's human and comes back when she returns to wolf form."
974,2018-03-23 17:16:28,Twokinds,"The question is, would the wound be healed more by the time she's spent as a human?"
975,2018-03-23 17:16:35,Twokinds,Or would it be the same amount as it was when she changed back
985,2018-03-23 17:17:36,Twokinds,Hulk's not really a fair comparison though
986,2018-03-23 17:17:57,Twokinds,Hulk is Hulk. Injuries aren't really too much of a problem for him.
1007,2018-03-23 17:20:10,Twokinds,Well she wouldn't really know
1010,2018-03-23 17:21:19,Twokinds,"Actually she would. She did change back partially, so maybe I'm the one that's wrong. XD"
1014,2018-03-23 17:21:54,Twokinds,"So injuries do remain, I suppose"
1023,2018-03-23 17:22:56,Twokinds,Does food stay in her stomach when she changes?
1029,2018-03-23 17:23:09,Twokinds,If she ate a bunch of bread and then changed into a wolf would she get sick?
1037,2018-03-23 17:23:41,Twokinds,lol
1039,2018-03-23 17:23:49,Twokinds,Well it's not like I've thought of EVERYTHING
1041,2018-03-23 17:23:58,Twokinds,Raine is holding Raine
1046,2018-03-23 17:24:24,Twokinds,Well bread doesn't really hurt adult Keidran that much
1047,2018-03-23 17:24:29,Twokinds,But too much of anything isn't good
1052,2018-03-23 17:25:22,Twokinds,They probably can't handle as much chocolate as a human
1057,2018-03-23 17:25:37,Twokinds,But they are a lot more massive than your average cat or dog
1058,2018-03-23 17:25:42,Twokinds,So they could eat some fine
1115,2018-03-23 17:37:55,Twokinds,no more food I'm on a diet

1249,2018-03-23 18:04:21,Twokinds,"The real reason Raine has paws on her hands is because, otherwise, she's pretty much entirely snow-white."
1251,2018-03-23 18:04:35,Twokinds,So having a vibrant pink on her hands and feet makes them stand out.
1308,2018-03-23 18:29:03,Twokinds,Now's a pretty good time to jump in. We're just finishing up a chapter.
1316,2018-03-23 18:29:40,Twokinds,Yeah there's two pages left

1234,2018-03-25 17:08:35,Twokinds,"I honestly miss my old 24HD. If it weren't for the resolution, and how outdated it is now, I'd just get another one."
1236,2018-03-25 17:10:28,Twokinds,It just came out this year
1237,2018-03-25 17:10:35,Twokinds,It's a 4k tablet
1238,2018-03-25 17:10:50,Twokinds,The old 24HD was 1080
1243,2018-03-25 17:12:37,Twokinds,Thinking on it
1244,2018-03-25 17:13:17,Twokinds,Honestly the new tablets are pretty lackluster too
1245,2018-03-25 17:13:29,Twokinds,Other than resolution they don't have anything I want.

1282,2018-03-25 17:37:45,Twokinds,But you don't have to buy it for me XD

1295,2018-03-25 17:40:38,Twokinds,"The thing is uncomfortable, though."
1297,2018-03-25 17:40:57,Twokinds,I find myself reluctant to play for long periods of time simply because it's not comfortable to wear.
1298,2018-03-25 17:41:12,Twokinds,I feel like making it lighter and easier to wear is  the #1 they need to work on.

207,2018-03-26 23:06:49,Twokinds,30 bucks? jeez
209,2018-03-26 23:07:30,Twokinds,I replaced my phone's battery last December and it was 13.99
218,2018-03-26 23:09:46,Twokinds,Eh my phone's batter only lasted about 2 years before it became noticable short
233,2018-03-26 23:17:06,Twokinds,I have a Note 4

1105,2018-03-30 03:00:00,Twokinds,I have no idea.
1108,2018-03-30 03:00:28,Twokinds,I've never traced my geneology.
1109,2018-03-30 03:00:42,Twokinds,At least not far.
1114,2018-03-30 03:01:01,Twokinds,My mother's father was born and raised in what's now North Korea.
1117,2018-03-30 03:01:39,Twokinds,"He was actually from a pretty well-off family, before they had to flee. Hard times after that."
1119,2018-03-30 03:01:48,Twokinds,Especially after he had 6 daughters trying to get a son.
1120,2018-03-30 03:01:50,Twokinds,XD

1174,2018-03-30 03:14:19,Twokinds,I think I see a solution in this
1176,2018-03-30 03:14:35,Twokinds,Combining a child and a pet...
1180,2018-03-30 03:14:43,Twokinds,It's the perfect solution.
1226,2018-03-30 03:23:47,Twokinds,Or gained! :D
14,2018-03-31 14:16:23,Twokinds,"Darn you, Easter"

17,2018-03-31 14:16:59,Twokinds,Now I'm not sure what to do.

37,2018-03-31 14:22:39,Twokinds,"Hm. The dinner's at 6, I could probably be back by 8 and do some sketches then."
39,2018-03-31 14:23:53,Twokinds,"No, I won't be able to do the whole thing, but I should be able to do a few at least."
40,2018-03-31 14:24:07,Twokinds,"I've got a lot of Nora Cards to post anyway, so it should be fine."
43,2018-03-31 14:29:23,Twokinds,There
44,2018-03-31 14:29:32,Twokinds,New offline thing for people who come in
53,2018-03-31 14:31:52,Twokinds,"Does the name really change too? Ugh I'm just gunna keep calling it est pff timezones, whatever"
54,2018-03-31 14:32:07,Twokinds,Tis a silly system anyway

1170,2018-03-31 21:04:21,Twokinds,"I think I'm going to work on sketches later, maybe on my own time."
1179,2018-03-31 21:04:43,Twokinds,Tomorrow I need to stream Nora card
1187,2018-03-31 21:05:06,Twokinds,Tuesday I need to stream Nora card

1419,2018-03-31 21:36:32,Twokinds,I apologize
1423,2018-03-31 21:36:51,Twokinds,I didn't expect the sudden change of plans until I got the message this morning.
1433,2018-03-31 21:37:27,Twokinds,"I was intending to stream at the regular time up until I woke up. Just playing it by ear, didn't know if I would be or now."
1453,2018-03-31 21:40:09,Twokinds,"I'm sorry, in the future I'll just say to wait for the post."
1458,2018-03-31 21:40:33,Twokinds,"I make an announcement on the Patreon, and you can follow the Picarto to get notified when a stream starts."
1527,2018-03-31 21:53:03,Twokinds,"Fine, I'm feeling a little better"

649,2018-04-01 01:00:59,Twokinds,So I don't have a favorite.
655,2018-04-01 01:01:31,Twokinds,Uh...
656,2018-04-01 01:01:40,Twokinds,"I saw the first pirates movie, I think"
660,2018-04-01 01:01:53,Twokinds,I don't watch many movies.
664,2018-04-01 01:02:52,Twokinds,Star Wars
668,2018-04-01 01:03:19,Twokinds,You're dead to me
677,2018-04-01 01:04:06,Twokinds,For the longest time that's all I had
679,2018-04-01 01:04:16,Twokinds,"a tv, a vcr, and a box set of star wars."
680,2018-04-01 01:04:23,Twokinds,So I watched them over and over.
688,2018-04-01 01:06:02,Twokinds,"Fine, you're alive to me again."
692,2018-04-01 01:06:31,Twokinds,Recording? I did not have such luxuries.
694,2018-04-01 01:06:36,Twokinds,I had to hope it wasn't a rerun.
695,2018-04-01 01:06:53,Twokinds,And hope I didn't miss one

719,2018-04-01 01:09:20,Twokinds,"It's more like, the difference between Scots and Brits"
736,2018-04-01 01:11:49,Twokinds,That would have been such a foreign concept to my young self's mind
738,2018-04-01 01:12:06,Twokinds,"When I was little, the original Star Wars wasn't even a movie."
739,2018-04-01 01:12:24,Twokinds,It was just a... thing that exists. Everyone saw it. It was it's own classification of media.
746,2018-04-01 01:13:23,Twokinds,"No, I mean, I was little. I didn't have solid concepts. I just knew there were movies, and then Star Wars"
763,2018-04-01 01:15:49,Twokinds,I've seen most Star Trek
766,2018-04-01 01:16:02,Twokinds,Of course

1350,2018-04-01 04:06:18,Twokinds,I mean they are
1352,2018-04-01 04:06:29,Twokinds,But they're not made by the people who make Elder Scrolls and Fallout
1353,2018-04-01 04:06:34,Twokinds,Those are seperate studios
1357,2018-04-01 04:08:13,Twokinds,Prey's a great game though.
1358,2018-04-01 04:09:07,Twokinds,Not entirely linear. The station itself you unlock as you go and then can freely move around it.

3224,2018-04-02 23:58:29,Twokinds,But no computers.
8,2018-04-03 00:00:59,Twokinds,Yeah colin is a lot more rustic and down to earth
314,2018-04-03 00:32:48,Twokinds,Doesn't really fit her character to give her hightlights
326,2018-04-03 00:33:27,Twokinds,"She's known as an up-tight, no-risks, neat-freak"
347,2018-04-03 00:36:52,Twokinds,I dunno I dunno
348,2018-04-03 00:37:01,Twokinds,I'll keep working on his furcolor but I'm tired
392,2018-04-03 00:41:16,Twokinds,These are my jokes
401,2018-04-03 00:42:15,Twokinds,I'm not satistfied with these colors
416,2018-04-03 00:43:38,Twokinds,No no
418,2018-04-03 00:43:45,Twokinds,It doesn't match the sketch version of him
437,2018-04-03 00:46:49,Twokinds,Perfect
461,2018-04-03 00:48:02,Twokinds,nononononoon
464,2018-04-03 00:48:07,Twokinds,No character with complex fur
465,2018-04-03 00:48:08,Twokinds,Never
606,2018-04-03 01:00:57,Twokinds,Golden is pretty much what I imagined him to be
609,2018-04-03 01:01:13,Twokinds,"Like, originally"
612,2018-04-03 01:01:33,Twokinds,"I mean, I named him colin"
613,2018-04-03 01:01:43,Twokinds,"Like, a collie"
630,2018-04-03 01:03:44,Twokinds,"Okay, stream over thanks to Vatruvius"
635,2018-04-03 01:03:59,Twokinds,xD
661,2018-04-03 01:06:40,Twokinds,Okay it'll be something like this
662,2018-04-03 01:06:41,Twokinds,Maybe
663,2018-04-03 01:06:43,Twokinds,Possibly
713,2018-04-03 01:10:57,Twokinds,I'm done for tonight
728,2018-04-03 01:11:16,Twokinds,Thanks for joining me
739,2018-04-03 01:11:45,Twokinds,G'night!
757,2018-04-03 01:13:05,Twokinds,byeee!
784,2018-04-03 01:25:18,Twokinds,I immediately changed Colin's colors again after the stream
792,2018-04-03 01:28:59,Twokinds,There's not enough colors to choose from.
793,2018-04-03 01:29:05,Twokinds,Photoshop really needs to add a new one.
808,2018-04-03 01:35:25,Twokinds,I already did that with Trace
858,2018-04-03 03:10:55,Twokinds,I think I've finally settled on a color scheme
859,2018-04-03 03:11:02,Twokinds,Though I'll have to see how I feel when I wake up tomorrow
868,2018-04-03 03:39:26,Twokinds,He's a golden
873,2018-04-03 04:14:21,Twokinds,You know what's sad?
876,2018-04-03 04:15:41,Twokinds,A thought I had while working on this was that I have to make the colors work for when someone inevitably requests a gender / sppecies swap of these two.
879,2018-04-03 04:16:29,Twokinds,I just did. I'm headed to bed soon.
883,2018-04-03 04:18:01,Twokinds,"My concern now is that if she's blonde and he's a golden, they're both going ot look similiar when shifted."
889,2018-04-03 04:20:49,Twokinds,"Maybe, maybe not"
890,2018-04-03 04:20:51,Twokinds,I don't know.
897,2018-04-03 04:27:36,Twokinds,g'night

547,2018-04-05 03:46:31,Twokinds,"She's whining because I ran out of wet cat food, so all she has is - gasp!- dry!"

1351,2018-04-05 20:17:31,Twokinds,Naw they just keep him. He lives happily among islander basitin hippies.
1384,2018-04-05 20:19:55,Twokinds,Well whatever happens to him after this can be left to the viewer's imagination XD

2287,2018-04-05 21:43:42,Twokinds,arg
2288,2018-04-05 21:43:45,Twokinds,so hungry
2307,2018-04-05 21:44:47,Twokinds,Want burrito
2478,2018-04-05 21:59:03,Twokinds,I am starving - I'm gunna grab something to eat real quick
2480,2018-04-05 21:59:09,Twokinds,"Sorry, brb!"
2520,2018-04-05 22:02:20,Twokinds,Sandwich time
2532,2018-04-05 22:02:51,Twokinds,It's kinda like a burrito
2604,2018-04-05 22:07:50,Twokinds,Very good
2606,2018-04-05 22:07:57,Twokinds,Also have an ice cream sandwich
2610,2018-04-05 22:08:10,Twokinds,Which is like a burrito but with ice cream and a sandwich
2613,2018-04-05 22:08:25,Twokinds,They should make an ice cream burrito
2985,2018-04-05 22:43:21,Twokinds,She dipped her arm in the paint
536,2018-04-06 00:46:08,Twokinds,roll charisma

750,2018-04-06 01:08:48,Twokinds,Done! :)
842,2018-04-06 01:19:02,Twokinds,"They're not tattoos, it's just paint"
849,2018-04-06 01:19:32,Twokinds,So I could just have them wearing simplier markings
851,2018-04-06 01:19:42,Twokinds,If I ever need to draw them more XD
874,2018-04-06 01:21:35,Twokinds,Yeah thanks for watching!
878,2018-04-06 01:21:47,Twokinds,G'night!
885,2018-04-06 01:21:59,Twokinds,White hair is common among Westerners
890,2018-04-06 01:22:08,Twokinds,It's a genetic anomoly
905,2018-04-06 01:22:59,Twokinds,"A long, long time ago"
906,2018-04-06 01:23:07,Twokinds,On an island far far away.
912,2018-04-06 01:23:26,Twokinds,Western Basitins are more spread out than their Eastern cousins.
917,2018-04-06 01:23:51,Twokinds,There are a lot on various small islands that don't really associate at all with the main island.
921,2018-04-06 01:24:41,Twokinds,"Yeah, small enclaves of islanders."
922,2018-04-06 01:24:49,Twokinds,They're the 'Wild' Basitins
930,2018-04-06 01:26:51,Twokinds,The mainlanders consider them weirdos because they're generally pacifistic and don't care about purpetual war.
931,2018-04-06 01:26:56,Twokinds,How uncivilized.
943,2018-04-06 01:28:20,Twokinds,Eh they''ll still spear ya
952,2018-04-06 01:29:33,Twokinds,"Yeah, not really. But at the same time Eastern Basitins don't really care about wiping out tiny islands of random people."
960,2018-04-06 01:30:34,Twokinds,They dip their legs in paint
961,2018-04-06 01:30:40,Twokinds,That makes it okay.
965,2018-04-06 01:31:09,Twokinds,(the easterners do not agree)
986,2018-04-06 01:35:25,Twokinds,"No, Westerners do not have the compulsion."
988,2018-04-06 01:35:40,Twokinds,They are 'dangerously free-willed'
992,2018-04-06 01:35:50,Twokinds,G'night!
1148,2018-04-06 02:57:08,Twokinds,I don't know a sound effect for ocean waves
1238,2018-04-06 04:43:22,Twokinds,I've been lucky enough to never have a bad experience at a dmv
1239,2018-04-06 04:43:43,Twokinds,"There's always just been one or two people there, and I'm in and out."
1240,2018-04-06 04:44:04,Twokinds,I'm sure it's different in denser places.
1244,2018-04-06 04:53:37,Twokinds,I'm working on it now
1253,2018-04-06 05:15:37,Twokinds,XD
1254,2018-04-06 05:15:42,Twokinds,That's great
1256,2018-04-06 05:51:02,Twokinds,Comic up
1261,2018-04-06 05:53:34,Twokinds,"Oh, I meant to write grand"
1262,2018-04-06 05:53:37,Twokinds,It's 7am
1275,2018-04-06 05:58:50,Twokinds,G'night everyone!
1280,2018-04-06 06:01:22,Twokinds,Sail away sail away
1281,2018-04-06 06:01:33,Twokinds,Thanks!
1298,2018-04-06 16:54:57,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-KatDance:
1301,2018-04-06 16:58:51,Twokinds,I'm having some wrist pain.
1302,2018-04-06 16:58:56,Twokinds,But otherwise I am good.
1305,2018-04-06 17:00:19,Twokinds,"Like, from a Chinese restaurant?"
1311,2018-04-06 17:03:21,Twokinds,"yeah, I like broccoli."
1314,2018-04-06 17:03:34,Twokinds,"I like most things, though."
1316,2018-04-06 17:03:45,Twokinds,I haven't played any of the Devil May Cry games.
1321,2018-04-06 17:04:57,Twokinds,I'm afraid not.
1336,2018-04-06 17:13:40,Twokinds,She's reluctantly eating.
1337,2018-04-06 17:13:54,Twokinds,She's fat anyway. So a diet is good for her.
1342,2018-04-06 17:18:44,Twokinds,"That sounds like a lot of work, and I'm not a... language expert"
1344,2018-04-06 17:20:31,Twokinds,Now I'm hungry for General Tso's Chicken
1350,2018-04-06 17:27:37,Twokinds,It probably wouldn't be worth it since Western Basitins aren't really a big part of the story
1351,2018-04-06 17:28:09,Twokinds,Maybe if I did side work involving Western Islanders. Then it might be funny  to hide hidden messages on their bodies.
1356,2018-04-06 17:41:20,Twokinds,I want to draw a Male Western Islander. Never drawn one before.
1362,2018-04-06 17:46:23,Twokinds,"yeah those are the original concept art for Western Basitins, back at the start of the comic."
1363,2018-04-06 17:47:07,Twokinds,Amazing they never showed up in the comic until 14 years later XD
1374,2018-04-06 18:01:59,Twokinds,"Nah Westerners are like anywhere else, close to 50-50 male-female."
1375,2018-04-06 18:03:20,Twokinds,It's not Themyscira XD
1377,2018-04-06 18:12:00,Twokinds,If they want to?
1384,2018-04-06 18:17:05,Twokinds,"I don't have a detailed map on Western Basitin culture, but no, they probably don't seperate roles between the genders like that."
1385,2018-04-06 18:18:05,Twokinds,"It's not a female-dominant society, like the tigers."
1387,2018-04-06 18:18:49,Twokinds,"It's pretty much a free, hippy-dippy anyone takes whatever roles they can fulfill kind of deal. A lot less rigid than Easterners."
1388,2018-04-06 18:20:03,Twokinds,They don't have the huge physical segrigation of gender like Keith's people.
1389,2018-04-06 18:20:27,Twokinds,"But you know, like any society, it's impossible to completely generalize."
1391,2018-04-06 18:22:02,Twokinds,Westerners are a lot less centralized than easterners. The eastern Basitins were pretty much one massive colony.
1392,2018-04-06 18:22:41,Twokinds,Westerners exist both on the mainland and on lots of tiny islands. So there's lots of micro-societies with different rules.
1394,2018-04-06 18:24:07,Twokinds,Well it didn't end very well.
1397,2018-04-06 18:28:32,Twokinds,"Well obviously she did, at least to an extent."
35,2018-04-07 01:22:16,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-sadtrace2:
100,2018-04-07 02:03:40,Twokinds,"Okay, I got that conversation mixed up"
102,2018-04-07 02:04:04,Twokinds,"I thought someone had combined a TCG with scrabble. Like, you play advanced, holographic letters."
103,2018-04-07 02:04:26,Twokinds,New letters!
108,2018-04-07 02:05:06,Twokinds,"It's the legendary ""th"" card!"
109,2018-04-07 02:05:08,Twokinds,So useful!
114,2018-04-07 02:06:31,Twokinds,"Little does he know, attaching to my word activates my word's trap card."
128,2018-04-07 02:19:16,Twokinds,No way man
129,2018-04-07 02:19:21,Twokinds,Can't do it again. Not again.
133,2018-04-07 02:23:36,Twokinds,lol
134,2018-04-07 02:23:51,Twokinds,So many allowances... wasted...
138,2018-04-07 02:25:13,Twokinds,"Though, admittedly, I wasted way more money on anime dvds"
139,2018-04-07 02:25:41,Twokinds,"Man those things were so expensive. Like, 20 bucks for a DVD with maybe 3-4 episodes."
141,2018-04-07 02:26:20,Twokinds,Yeah
143,2018-04-07 02:26:54,Twokinds,Well... that wasn't really an option back then.
151,2018-04-07 02:28:11,Twokinds,I remember I started out at 2 dollars / week
154,2018-04-07 02:28:43,Twokinds,"It went up to $10 / week, though for a while, we had to give up allowances when we were going through rough times."
158,2018-04-07 02:29:21,Twokinds,Yeah
160,2018-04-07 02:30:03,Twokinds,It really makes me realize in retrospect how bad things were at the time. My dad did a lot to hide it.
161,2018-04-07 02:30:39,Twokinds,He would promise to reemburse all the allowances later.
286,2018-04-07 14:33:34,Twokinds,3:33
288,2018-04-07 14:33:49,Twokinds,Good morning
289,2018-04-07 14:33:51,Twokinds,I just woke up
301,2018-04-07 14:39:09,Twokinds,No stream is on schedule
336,2018-04-07 14:58:33,Twokinds,Okay it's going to be a bit late...
347,2018-04-07 14:59:38,Twokinds,Man I need to implement a word count on these suggestions
351,2018-04-07 14:59:54,Twokinds,Seriously... 7 paragraphs? come on...
367,2018-04-07 15:00:56,Twokinds,I'm going to have to make it like 120 characters. People will have to actually think about the words they use.
460,2018-04-07 15:10:22,Twokinds,"Okay, almost done editing"
541,2018-04-07 15:19:57,Twokinds,"Okay, I was rushed"
545,2018-04-07 15:20:17,Twokinds,Hopefully all the suggestions are fine and in there if not whatever we'll deal with it
555,2018-04-07 15:21:01,Twokinds,Obviously I have to take out the dumb ones
557,2018-04-07 15:21:11,Twokinds,And I have to rewrite everything so they fit in the poller
567,2018-04-07 15:22:11,Twokinds,Anyone who adds an extra blank line in their suggestion to break up all the text earns my ire
578,2018-04-07 15:23:32,Twokinds,"Whatever, it's fine."
907,2018-04-07 15:50:02,Twokinds,"sorry, brb I need to fix something"
962,2018-04-07 15:57:54,Twokinds,Uh... I usually find myself replacing them maybe 1 or 2 times a year?
1087,2018-04-07 16:11:49,Twokinds,Trace was 8 years old when he met Nora
1102,2018-04-07 16:13:17,Twokinds,She was one of the teachers at the school
1105,2018-04-07 16:13:33,Twokinds,no
1358,2018-04-07 16:33:55,Twokinds,Done
1466,2018-04-07 16:42:03,Twokinds,Thanks
1467,2018-04-07 16:42:08,Twokinds,I was happy with how they came out
1469,2018-04-07 16:42:23,Twokinds,I've had their designs in my head for a looooong time
1470,2018-04-07 16:42:26,Twokinds,"Like, the beginning of the comic"
1481,2018-04-07 16:42:55,Twokinds,Of course they're western
1757,2018-04-07 17:12:35,Twokinds,done
1876,2018-04-07 17:19:13,Twokinds,"Oh for crying out loud, I didn't see it."
1884,2018-04-07 17:19:36,Twokinds,Yeah if it wins I'll just make her dragon
1886,2018-04-07 17:19:39,Twokinds,It won't be humanoid
2027,2018-04-07 17:28:11,Twokinds,oh crap
2031,2018-04-07 17:28:21,Twokinds,locked my cat in the bathroom
2033,2018-04-07 17:28:22,Twokinds,brb
2056,2018-04-07 17:29:21,Twokinds,I didn't know she was in there. And I couldn't hear her meowing with my headphones on
2061,2018-04-07 17:29:47,Twokinds,She mad
2124,2018-04-07 17:36:24,Twokinds,eugh that's an ugly dress
2213,2018-04-07 17:45:45,Twokinds,Lynn op
2271,2018-04-07 17:53:18,Twokinds,I am unfortunately not a fashion designer
2451,2018-04-07 18:13:10,Twokinds,I didn't even look at what suggestions place
2454,2018-04-07 18:13:28,Twokinds,I just pick one at random
2483,2018-04-07 18:15:40,Twokinds,All dresses look the same. I'm basing this on what dresses generally look like
2525,2018-04-07 18:19:07,Twokinds,Wait one sec
2562,2018-04-07 18:23:01,Twokinds,Back in 4 minutes
2787,2018-04-07 18:38:13,Twokinds,Done!
2852,2018-04-07 18:42:59,Twokinds,Yeah I don't look at the placements usually
2857,2018-04-07 18:43:13,Twokinds,Which leads to people getting mad sometimes when I pick the one that was least voted on ^^;
3345,2018-04-07 19:28:28,Twokinds,Done!
3462,2018-04-07 19:34:29,Twokinds,Okay done for real
3508,2018-04-07 19:37:36,Twokinds,I don't know

133,2018-04-08 01:02:10,Twokinds,Imagine if you really could pay people to take your weight for you.

2090,2018-04-12 22:04:54,Twokinds,indeed
2099,2018-04-12 22:05:54,Twokinds,At least these shouldn't be as difficult to do

6302,2018-04-14 21:57:17,Twokinds,I'm sure it won't be

6660,2018-04-14 23:45:54,Twokinds,"I had something similiar happen to be, but with Steam"
6662,2018-04-14 23:46:17,Twokinds,"You play ONE survival crafting game, and that's ALL steam will ever recommend."
6663,2018-04-14 23:46:26,Twokinds,"Darn you, Subnautica."
6668,2018-04-14 23:47:09,Twokinds,I mean if you consider being stuck out in the middle of an endless sea 'horror'
6672,2018-04-14 23:47:40,Twokinds,I did really enjoy Subnautica.
6675,2018-04-14 23:47:59,Twokinds,But I don't generally like most of the other crap that's flooded Steam
6681,2018-04-14 23:48:56,Twokinds,Especially since most of them are multiplayer focused
6683,2018-04-14 23:49:02,Twokinds,And I couldn't care less about multiplayer.
6686,2018-04-14 23:49:42,Twokinds,I put 79 hours into my playthrough of Subnautica before I beat it. I think that's pretty signifigent.
6692,2018-04-14 23:50:20,Twokinds,"Yeah I guess Rimworld is technically a survival crafting game too. Darn it, they've got me."
6697,2018-04-14 23:51:10,Twokinds,I'm just waiting for Pillars of Eternity 2 to come out...
6704,2018-04-14 23:53:53,Twokinds,I did get some sun the other day

6722,2018-04-14 23:55:27,Twokinds,"Yeah. Not even riding, I had to push it."
6728,2018-04-14 23:55:36,Twokinds,"Sigh, times are tough."
6734,2018-04-14 23:56:21,Twokinds,"This morning I woke up at noon, and 1 and 2."
6736,2018-04-14 23:56:31,Twokinds,And then one last time at 2:20
6745,2018-04-14 23:57:23,Twokinds,Kinda wish I had a wall clock.
6747,2018-04-14 23:57:28,Twokinds,Or an alarm clock
6749,2018-04-14 23:57:34,Twokinds,I have to ask my computer what time it is.
6758,2018-04-14 23:58:01,Twokinds,I feel like Alexa gets annoyed by me constantly asking what time it is every half hour before I can be bothered to get up.
6761,2018-04-14 23:58:34,Twokinds,"It is nice living in the future, though."
8,2018-04-15 00:02:10,Twokinds,"Well, unsteddy is in the future"

86,2018-04-15 00:39:32,Twokinds,It's the second half of the Basitin island arc
87,2018-04-15 00:39:43,Twokinds,So it goes until they leave the island.

113,2018-04-15 00:45:04,Twokinds,You get a signed print.
116,2018-04-15 00:45:20,Twokinds,"Well, the first 400 or so people get a signed print. Then they run out."
122,2018-04-15 00:46:33,Twokinds,"I mean, I can only send a finite number"
123,2018-04-15 00:46:47,Twokinds,I have to sign them all and send them to keenspot ahead of time
131,2018-04-15 00:48:22,Twokinds,"I signed 14,000 pieces of merch during the Kickstarter."
132,2018-04-15 00:48:27,Twokinds,I'm never doing that again.

212,2018-04-15 01:07:45,Twokinds,"She has this terrible habit of laying down on my space bar, causing Youtube videos go pause and play rapidly"
222,2018-04-15 01:09:25,Twokinds,Well that's why I'd never have a dog.
225,2018-04-15 01:10:00,Twokinds,I'm not alergic to dogs.
239,2018-04-15 01:12:12,Twokinds,Still don't know what I want Colin to be.

294,2018-04-15 01:28:50,Twokinds,He's painfully naive and self-concious.
295,2018-04-15 01:29:04,Twokinds,He's like a dog. A little dim but lovable.

411,2018-04-15 02:27:33,Twokinds,"I was told there wasn't going to be bundles this time, but the books can be bought together and have the discount applied."
414,2018-04-15 02:27:57,Twokinds,So the discount code is their way of trying to simplify things.
417,2018-04-15 02:29:16,Twokinds,not sure

807,2018-04-16 20:33:40,Twokinds,Books are a lot heavier than prints.
808,2018-04-16 20:34:09,Twokinds,And I don't want to handle thousands of pounds of books.

1240,2018-04-16 22:56:24,Twokinds,There was only three students in my entire 1st grade class.
1241,2018-04-16 22:56:37,Twokinds,"Like, for the whole school. Just us three."
1242,2018-04-16 22:56:44,Twokinds,"And our names were Tom, Tim, and Tonya."
1247,2018-04-16 22:57:15,Twokinds,It's true.
1249,2018-04-16 22:57:36,Twokinds,I never saw Tonya again but I was friends with Tim for a while. I actually met up with him again a few years back.
1251,2018-04-16 22:57:56,Twokinds,It's weird meeting up with old friends from school.
1253,2018-04-16 22:58:36,Twokinds,"I looked up my best friend from middle school, and I was pretty surprised. Completely different."
1255,2018-04-16 22:58:58,Twokinds,"From what I can tell, he's SUPER religious now."
1257,2018-04-16 22:59:16,Twokinds,"He definitely wasn't before. I don't have anything against the religious, but it's like... wow..."
1261,2018-04-16 23:00:00,Twokinds,"Like, how does that happen."
1266,2018-04-16 23:01:26,Twokinds,I am exactly the same as I was when I was 14!

1322,2018-04-16 23:11:33,Twokinds,True
1324,2018-04-16 23:11:43,Twokinds,I'd probably be just as much of a shut in.

1440,2018-04-16 23:29:51,Twokinds,Uh... that's hard to tell
1441,2018-04-16 23:29:55,Twokinds,I couldn't say
1443,2018-04-16 23:30:31,Twokinds,"More male than female, but not by that much."
1456,2018-04-16 23:33:08,Twokinds,"You know, there was one girl who would hang around our booth for hours."
1459,2018-04-16 23:33:23,Twokinds,She'd sit down next to our table.
1466,2018-04-16 23:34:05,Twokinds,Oh she wasn't nervous
1467,2018-04-16 23:34:11,Twokinds,She was extremely energetic and talkative
1473,2018-04-16 23:34:47,Twokinds,"I mean, you CAN"
1474,2018-04-16 23:34:51,Twokinds,physically
1479,2018-04-16 23:35:24,Twokinds,"You know, my first year at comic con was funny. We had a little girl who hung around the booth. She was a daughter of another creator."
1484,2018-04-16 23:35:42,Twokinds,"She would ask to see my artwork and I'd be very reluctant to because she was like, 10"
1490,2018-04-16 23:36:14,Twokinds,But then one of the other people working there showed me what her mom does. Her mom's a pinup artist.
1498,2018-04-16 23:37:15,Twokinds,lol yeah that made me feel a lot better.
1499,2018-04-16 23:37:28,Twokinds,They were very open and nice people.
1504,2018-04-16 23:38:14,Twokinds,There's no min age. There's kids all over the place.
1508,2018-04-16 23:38:30,Twokinds,Nudity isn't allowed to be shown. You have to cover it with sticky notes if there is any.
1514,2018-04-16 23:39:17,Twokinds,No not mine.
1523,2018-04-16 23:39:54,Twokinds,No people are good about it because it's hard to get in comic-con and no one wants to screw up and get kicked out
1554,2018-04-16 23:45:58,Twokinds,"Honestly, nothing really comes to mind. I've never had a very bad con experience."
1560,2018-04-16 23:46:55,Twokinds,"Everything always generally goes my way, so unfortunately, that means I have very little to complain about."
1565,2018-04-16 23:47:43,Twokinds,"Yeah, it sucks. Everything's just great all the time."
1593,2018-04-16 23:53:37,Twokinds,Did you say 'blatantly ignoring'?
1594,2018-04-16 23:53:39,Twokinds,Hm...
1595,2018-04-16 23:53:44,Twokinds,This gives me an idea...
1610,2018-04-16 23:58:55,Twokinds,I pronounce it 'Proto-Fries'

30,2018-04-17 00:08:49,Twokinds,Just eating less diet.
32,2018-04-17 00:09:02,Twokinds,I'm aiming for around 1200 - 1400 calories.
37,2018-04-17 00:09:41,Twokinds,That's... interesting
44,2018-04-17 00:10:13,Twokinds,I want it
47,2018-04-17 00:10:29,Twokinds,"I used to not like bell peppers, but my tastes have changed a lot."
50,2018-04-17 00:10:42,Twokinds,I like pretty much anything these days.
52,2018-04-17 00:10:49,Twokinds,Except mushrooms.
54,2018-04-17 00:11:02,Twokinds,"I don't like mushroom. I'll eat it, but I don't care for it."
60,2018-04-17 00:11:44,Twokinds,Ever smell mushroom soaked in water? Fills the whole house.
70,2018-04-17 00:13:03,Twokinds,If someone offers me mushrooms and tells me they're good they better be magic.
73,2018-04-17 00:13:17,Twokinds,hahaha
75,2018-04-17 00:14:00,Twokinds,"Eh, I'm find with either. Steamed brocoli and coliflower is good."
91,2018-04-17 00:16:31,Twokinds,I really want to make some bulgogi
96,2018-04-17 00:17:06,Twokinds,ya
130,2018-04-17 00:24:52,Twokinds,"We should all go out for a barbecue, I'll make you a korean feast."
181,2018-04-17 00:36:05,Twokinds,"If you get rid of all the 10s, wouldn't the 9s just become 10s?"
261,2018-04-17 01:59:06,Twokinds,"Man, I fall asleep easy."
262,2018-04-17 01:59:12,Twokinds,No one ever thinks of me! :D
268,2018-04-17 02:00:47,Twokinds,What if they're standing in the room
270,2018-04-17 02:00:51,Twokinds,watching
269,2018-04-17 02:00:51,Twokinds,in the dark
271,2018-04-17 02:00:59,Twokinds,thinking of you.
278,2018-04-17 02:01:28,Twokinds,What if it's your cat
280,2018-04-17 02:01:40,Twokinds,Cause that's what mine does
290,2018-04-17 02:03:01,Twokinds,Well she does scratch me sometimes
291,2018-04-17 02:03:08,Twokinds,"So yeah, yandere"
303,2018-04-17 02:21:08,Twokinds,I don't think my cat could ever be conditioned for another person.
304,2018-04-17 02:21:17,Twokinds,She's very much a 1 person cat.
322,2018-04-17 14:26:09,Twokinds,What's Cold Waters?
335,2018-04-17 14:40:39,Twokinds,I don't find horror games interesting.
337,2018-04-17 14:41:28,Twokinds,"I don't find being scared very fun, and horror movies and games don't usually have much else to offer."
343,2018-04-17 14:43:48,Twokinds,"Hm, suspense... I guess it depends on the show."
344,2018-04-17 14:43:50,Twokinds,Or movie.

378,2018-04-17 16:09:25,Twokinds,That's their hobby don't judge.
496,2018-04-17 18:27:51,Twokinds,"At my high school, you had very limited pickings on classes you could take. Usually during Junior and Senior years."
708,2018-04-17 19:48:54,Twokinds,I've never even bought a gun and I have guns.
709,2018-04-17 19:48:59,Twokinds,That's how many guns are everywhere.
711,2018-04-17 19:49:39,Twokinds,No

737,2018-04-17 19:54:28,Twokinds,He also carved powder horns out of these near big animal horns.
742,2018-04-17 19:54:57,Twokinds,He was really into westerns.
752,2018-04-17 19:56:56,Twokinds,"Well, his family was from Louisville, Kentucky"
754,2018-04-17 19:57:17,Twokinds,"So, after getting out of the military and moving around a lot, we eventually settled down somewhat nearby."
755,2018-04-17 19:57:36,Twokinds,"He wanted to be close enough to visit family, I suppose."
756,2018-04-17 19:58:28,Twokinds,"Plus, liking westerns in books is a lot different than wanting to live it for real."
757,2018-04-17 19:58:32,Twokinds,XD
2,2018-04-18 00:31:05,Twokinds,I'm so frustrated working on this chapter 20 title page art.
7,2018-04-18 00:34:14,Twokinds,Yeah
8,2018-04-18 00:34:18,Twokinds,I just suck at title pages
12,2018-04-18 00:36:31,Twokinds,I want chapter 20 to be a calm before the storm. Just a short chapter where the characters can all interact sorta relaxed before stuff hits the fan for chapter 21
16,2018-04-18 00:37:13,Twokinds,yeah
18,2018-04-18 00:37:15,Twokinds,I got nothing
23,2018-04-18 00:38:59,Twokinds,That stuff is chapter 21
25,2018-04-18 00:39:24,Twokinds,Chapter 20 is the beach episode
32,2018-04-18 00:40:34,Twokinds,The beach room in Trace's estate.
44,2018-04-18 00:42:08,Twokinds,"Trace's beach has sand, but it's smooth and gentle and soothing, and it stays put."
54,2018-04-18 00:43:34,Twokinds,"I know you guys think I'm joking but I really do want just one day where all the characters can relax, since they're all in the same place for once."
56,2018-04-18 00:44:08,Twokinds,And then things can blow up
77,2018-04-18 00:48:03,Twokinds,Trace's magic beach is freshwater
81,2018-04-18 00:48:19,Twokinds,"It's his shower room, it's just enchanted to look like a beach."
93,2018-04-18 00:50:03,Twokinds,"putting the estate on the cover seems like a good idea, but at the same time"
95,2018-04-18 00:50:08,Twokinds,I really don't want to draw the estate again
101,2018-04-18 00:50:41,Twokinds,WELL I CAN'T EXACTLY HAVE A MANSION NOT LOOK FANCY
109,2018-04-18 00:51:04,Twokinds,"CAN you imagine. ""Look, there it is! Trace's estate!"" [it's a box]"
132,2018-04-18 00:53:48,Twokinds,"Trace, smiling in the shadows"
159,2018-04-18 01:00:25,Twokinds,yeah no

180,2018-04-18 01:06:38,Twokinds,"Yeah I know, it's pretty early, but I'm trying to get to bed earlier."
185,2018-04-18 01:07:20,Twokinds,lol that's what Sage says to me
186,2018-04-18 01:07:37,Twokinds,"Literally, the other day I told him I was going to bed and he said ""it's not even 4 yet"""
187,2018-04-18 01:07:46,Twokinds,Cause he's always going to bed around 7 - 8
202,2018-04-18 01:11:53,Twokinds,ok
203,2018-04-18 01:12:05,Twokinds,What kind of interactions are you guys hoping to see
204,2018-04-18 01:12:16,Twokinds,now that everyone is in one place
270,2018-04-18 01:26:37,Twokinds,"Well the only Basitin lady is Maddie, and she's not particularly feminine"

2373,2018-04-18 21:28:13,Twokinds,Probably because it matches her eyes

70,2018-04-19 00:16:15,Twokinds,That's what usually delayed the upload by like 12 hours
79,2018-04-19 00:17:27,Twokinds,"Creating all the dialogue, deciding someone wouldn't  say it like that. Changing it 100 times before deciding it was better the first way."

6533,2018-04-28 23:45:55,Twokinds,You can add 420 to that if you're feeling fancy.
6541,2018-04-28 23:47:00,Twokinds,Is it a boy?
66,2018-04-29 00:56:51,Twokinds,I should sleep...
74,2018-04-29 00:59:12,Twokinds,Allergies are just starting to steamroll me.
76,2018-04-29 00:59:25,Twokinds,Trying to push through the headfog. It's the worst.
79,2018-04-29 01:00:11,Twokinds,Well it's not like that.
81,2018-04-29 01:00:22,Twokinds,It's just a miserable tiredness.
84,2018-04-29 01:00:32,Twokinds,"Like, hard to focus."
85,2018-04-29 01:00:52,Twokinds,"Then again, that might also just be a side effect of the allergy meds."
89,2018-04-29 01:01:12,Twokinds,"I use Flonase, which isn't supposed to cause drowsiness or anything like that."
90,2018-04-29 01:01:15,Twokinds,But I dunno.
94,2018-04-29 01:02:01,Twokinds,I've been having vivid lucid dreams lately.
95,2018-04-29 01:02:10,Twokinds,"Which is cool, but I wake up feeling unrested."
100,2018-04-29 01:03:09,Twokinds,"I usually only dream when I'm having troubled sleep. Which makes sense, since I assume remembering dreams requires waking up, or being near awake."
104,2018-04-29 01:03:50,Twokinds,I'm pretty stressed.
107,2018-04-29 01:04:14,Twokinds,"Yeah It's always been my experience that I'm always dreaming, but 99.9% of it gets forgotten immediately."
110,2018-04-29 01:04:57,Twokinds,The stress is mostly just a feeling of being stuck in a rut.
114,2018-04-29 01:05:40,Twokinds,"I want to move, but feel a bit trapped by my family and cat. And also nerves about living on my own."
122,2018-04-29 01:08:46,Twokinds,I'm not sure what will happen to my mother if I move away.
126,2018-04-29 01:10:53,Twokinds,"My biggest fear is that I move, she later sells her house and needs a place to stay. Then it's back to square one again."
133,2018-04-29 01:18:36,Twokinds,"Eh, the taxes in this village are crazy."
134,2018-04-29 01:19:42,Twokinds,"I'd want to move a little bit farther from the city, into some of the more open areas."
141,2018-04-29 01:39:13,Twokinds,I don't know enough about lines on a map to know the difference.
145,2018-04-29 01:39:38,Twokinds,I'm not sure why one house has 6k taxes and one block over it's 3k taxes
148,2018-04-29 01:40:46,Twokinds,"Also, I ended up continuing working on these drawings after the stream lol."
169,2018-04-29 01:56:53,Twokinds,Gave the Adelaide one a simple background
172,2018-04-29 01:57:30,Twokinds,Uh... sort of a tribal hut wall
175,2018-04-29 01:58:17,Twokinds,"Also, improved the lighting of Maren and Raine a bit. Also, now Raine is providing her own steam via blushing."
181,2018-04-29 02:02:20,Twokinds,Also there's more hotsprings in the background
182,2018-04-29 02:02:49,Twokinds,Just don't fall into Spring of Drowned Squirrel

823,2018-04-29 15:47:38,Twokinds,He's so old he remembers when Adelaide was a kid.
826,2018-04-29 15:48:02,Twokinds,He was already a general even then.
837,2018-04-29 15:49:40,Twokinds,I can't remember if I ever gave him an exact number.
838,2018-04-29 15:49:50,Twokinds,He's just been around a long time.
857,2018-04-29 15:52:56,Twokinds,They don't really need it until they're an adult.

1205,2018-04-29 17:02:08,Twokinds,Just something simple...

1297,2018-04-29 17:12:27,Twokinds,I kinda think so too

1487,2018-04-29 17:47:10,Twokinds,I don't think being a shut in has much of an influence on knowing video games.
1489,2018-04-29 17:47:20,Twokinds,"In fact, there's probably a corrolation."
1498,2018-04-29 17:48:51,Twokinds,What else is there?
1511,2018-04-29 17:50:48,Twokinds,"I'm a pretty big shut in, but unless it's about sports or celebrities, I know most things in a general sense."
1515,2018-04-29 17:51:54,Twokinds,"Yeah, that's why I said I don't know it."
1522,2018-04-29 17:52:27,Twokinds,What? I know webcomics.
1524,2018-04-29 17:52:34,Twokinds,Are you misunderstanding

9,2018-04-30 01:52:37,Twokinds,Could be some possibilities with that.

394,2018-04-30 21:46:24,Twokinds,This is just about colors.

410,2018-04-30 21:53:52,Twokinds,That's silly.

542,2018-04-30 22:30:27,Twokinds,It said I had an even more than perfect score.

704,2018-04-30 22:55:07,Twokinds,"Yeah, just like... a little room I could go to whenever I want, outside of time."

2567,2018-05-03 23:22:38,Twokinds,Euchre might not have sided with Trace if he'd been aware he had a daughter.

167,2018-05-05 14:42:27,Twokinds,"It'd take too long on stream, it'd eat other suggestion's time."

172,2018-05-05 14:43:29,Twokinds,I can draw something if someone tells me what the prank is.
173,2018-05-05 14:43:35,Twokinds,But suggestions have to be specific.
179,2018-05-05 14:44:10,Twokinds,"Yeah, it'd also be pretty similiar to thatone."
184,2018-05-05 14:45:03,Twokinds,I'm going to delay the sketch stream until Monday. I need to message some suggestors and give time to change things.

220,2018-05-07 01:55:52,Twokinds,She's just pretty much existed in my room with me her whole life.
221,2018-05-07 01:56:05,Twokinds,"I try to get her out, but she just doesn't want to."
224,2018-05-07 01:56:39,Twokinds,She's bigger than three of my mom's dogs. But she's still scared of them.
229,2018-05-07 01:57:29,Twokinds,Yeah

1157,2018-05-10 21:53:49,Twokinds,Which is why Laura is so high up. I think I made them around the Basitin Island saga.

31,2018-05-16 16:32:19,Twokinds,I took your advice and made a salad. :D
34,2018-05-16 16:32:57,Twokinds,"Iceburg lettuce, bell pepper, and carrots. Simple, but effective."
35,2018-05-16 16:33:28,Twokinds,6 oz of ranch dressing.

41,2018-05-16 16:34:41,Twokinds,Since it's a lot less sugar.
44,2018-05-16 16:35:09,Twokinds,"It's a lot like french, but californian."
46,2018-05-16 16:35:31,Twokinds,It's like a less sharp version of Russian.
49,2018-05-16 16:39:00,Twokinds,"Growing up, I didn't like Ranch. French was my go-to, because it's sweet. Unfortunately, that sweetness also means it's not healthy, and kinda defeats the purpose of a salad."

5980,2018-05-19 22:28:51,Twokinds,I can't help with the excersize problem.

5994,2018-05-19 22:30:31,Twokinds,I should probably feed her the pouches at night.

6030,2018-05-19 22:34:58,Twokinds,Air holes?
6041,2018-05-19 22:38:26,Twokinds,Holly would not be happy with other cats around
6043,2018-05-19 22:38:38,Twokinds,She's terrified of every living thing that isn't me shaped.
6045,2018-05-19 22:38:53,Twokinds,Yeah.
6049,2018-05-19 22:39:20,Twokinds,I think I've given her stockholm syndrome.
6054,2018-05-19 22:39:45,Twokinds,"Eh... she's sort of okay with Mark, at least when he stays for a while."
6055,2018-05-19 22:39:55,Twokinds,Maybe because he's the most like me.

6139,2018-05-19 22:53:46,Twokinds,I'm not sure.

6149,2018-05-19 22:57:35,Twokinds,I might need to buy an auto-feeder.

6187,2018-05-19 23:11:06,Twokinds,But it's about 75000 more than I want to spend.
6203,2018-05-19 23:14:46,Twokinds,I actually am wondering if there's something wrong with the house.
6205,2018-05-19 23:15:19,Twokinds,"Because it looks so nice in photos, and it seems like a normal price for the neighborhood, but it hasn't sold in months."
6206,2018-05-19 23:15:30,Twokinds,"Nah, I haven't looked at any houses in person yet."
6216,2018-05-19 23:16:46,Twokinds,"Yeah, I guess"
6217,2018-05-19 23:17:13,Twokinds,Right now I'm just trying to save as much money as possible so I'm in the best position when I do decide to talk to a broker and see how much I can afford.

24,2018-05-21 00:19:16,Twokinds,It gets reduced a little but not that much. It has a lid.
27,2018-05-21 00:20:00,Twokinds,It's just simmering
31,2018-05-21 00:21:40,Twokinds,"2lb beef, 2lb carrots, 2lb potatoes, 1lb onions, beef stock and seasoning."
37,2018-05-21 00:22:24,Twokinds,"You simmer the beef onions and seasoning for an hour, then with the water level lower, fill it back up with carrots and potatoes."
46,2018-05-21 00:26:21,Twokinds,"After 3 hours of simmering, you can't even see the onions anymore."
47,2018-05-21 00:26:30,Twokinds,They just disintigrate into the broth.
53,2018-05-21 00:28:11,Twokinds,No
54,2018-05-21 00:28:49,Twokinds,You just dump the beef in the soup and skim the fat and junk as it heats up.
58,2018-05-21 00:30:33,Twokinds,"This is an old picture, but here's what it looks like:"

110,2018-05-21 00:48:46,Twokinds,"Yeah, it's so each slice also gets you bacon."
111,2018-05-21 00:48:52,Twokinds,Because bacon.

137,2018-05-21 00:57:52,Twokinds,Yeah
138,2018-05-21 00:58:42,Twokinds,I used to have a drawer at my work desk dedicated to snacks. A huge variety of candy boxes. The other side was a drawer for chips and salsa.
139,2018-05-21 00:58:49,Twokinds,"Man, I miss those days."
141,2018-05-21 00:59:06,Twokinds,The days when I didn't care at all. XD
143,2018-05-21 00:59:24,Twokinds,lol no I had an office desk.
145,2018-05-21 00:59:46,Twokinds,So I could work on twokinds and snacks were within easy idle eating reach.
150,2018-05-21 01:00:15,Twokinds,"Well, I had a minifridge for dip."
151,2018-05-21 01:00:22,Twokinds,Can't just leave that out.

178,2018-05-21 01:05:46,Twokinds,I tell anyone who comes by that I don't live here.
179,2018-05-21 01:06:09,Twokinds,I'll probably keep doing that when I get my new house.
186,2018-05-21 01:07:12,Twokinds,"Well, it helps with the rare door salesman or neighbor that comes by."
188,2018-05-21 01:07:46,Twokinds,"Probably confusing though when I answer the door, say I don't live there, and close it again."
194,2018-05-21 01:09:11,Twokinds,lol
195,2018-05-21 01:09:32,Twokinds,It's much less responsibility if people just assume I'm renting a room.
196,2018-05-21 01:09:51,Twokinds,"Of course, now I have a doorbell intercom, so I just don't go to the door at all now."
202,2018-05-21 01:11:04,Twokinds,"If it's someone I don't recognize, I ask what they want through my phone. if it's a sales person, I say I'm not home and turn it off."

222,2018-05-21 01:16:13,Twokinds,lol maybe that's why I've never seen them

1021,2018-06-14 21:46:53,Twokinds,But I guess you guys have all seen it now.
1047,2018-06-14 21:48:04,Twokinds,Yeah it's been a very long time
1048,2018-06-14 21:48:07,Twokinds,I apologize for that
1051,2018-06-14 21:48:21,Twokinds,Patreon keeps me so busy I never get a lot of free time to work on something else
1202,2018-06-14 22:09:10,Twokinds,Rose has a lot of experience not trusting people
1237,2018-06-14 22:16:20,Twokinds,XD
1256,2018-06-14 22:20:29,Twokinds,Yeah Trace doesn't legally own Rose.
1269,2018-06-14 22:21:54,Twokinds,It really depends.
1275,2018-06-14 22:22:36,Twokinds,Most end up in servitude to someone else one way or another.
1278,2018-06-14 22:22:45,Twokinds,A lot don't really have any means of getting back to their own lands.
1284,2018-06-14 22:23:19,Twokinds,"Some are willed land by their owners, which is technically legal, but well..."
1286,2018-06-14 22:23:32,Twokinds,"Human neighbors like more land, and..."
1291,2018-06-14 22:24:08,Twokinds,Keidran like Adira are fairly uncommon exceptions
1308,2018-06-14 22:26:06,Twokinds,I can imagine a someone darkly humorous situation where a Keidran inherits land from a human and just pretends to be his own servent by proxy.
1330,2018-06-14 22:27:43,Twokinds,"I can imagine it as a dark comedy, where he gets really successful, then keidran freedom fighters come along and try to drag him to 'freedom'"
1361,2018-06-14 22:29:59,Twokinds,ooo
1366,2018-06-14 22:30:15,Twokinds,And then the plot could be him sending mercs to recapture himself

616,2018-06-20 21:52:38,Twokinds,So don't start quoting me.

648,2018-06-20 21:59:22,Twokinds,lol
650,2018-06-20 21:59:38,Twokinds,"I suppose. Tigers are very isolations, so humans are hugely exotic to them."
654,2018-06-20 22:00:55,Twokinds,They see humans as very ugly. But some tigers like ugly.
658,2018-06-20 22:01:51,Twokinds,"Well, the jungles and forests of tiger territory are very damp."
659,2018-06-20 22:02:00,Twokinds,So shaving might actually be better.
663,2018-06-20 22:02:43,Twokinds,Oh yes.
671,2018-06-20 22:04:09,Twokinds,A lot of tigers will assume a shaved tiger is an actor.
674,2018-06-20 22:05:07,Twokinds,Because a lot of plays that portray humans use shaved tigers.
679,2018-06-20 22:06:40,Twokinds,Well... theatre is a common form of entertainment.

5,2018-06-24 00:03:36,Twokinds,I'm trying to do another project
7,2018-06-24 00:03:49,Twokinds,But it's hard to get any free moments.
11,2018-06-24 00:04:59,Twokinds,Exactly
12,2018-06-24 00:05:04,Twokinds,Which
15,2018-06-24 00:05:33,Twokinds,15 years of practice will make anyone good
16,2018-06-24 00:05:42,Twokinds,Or at least halfway decent
38,2018-06-24 00:12:06,Twokinds,I wish I could write better
39,2018-06-24 00:12:32,Twokinds,I can draw for hours but I write with great difficulty.
40,2018-06-24 00:12:58,Twokinds,I just can't stand to sit down and write out a script.
54,2018-06-24 00:14:44,Twokinds,"It wasn't easy, starting out. But I just loved to draw."
55,2018-06-24 00:14:55,Twokinds,"Did it all the time, even when I was bad."

810,2018-06-25 14:45:57,Twokinds,"Yeah, I found out while I was coming home from the funeral."
812,2018-06-25 14:46:40,Twokinds,It's been a long couple of days.
813,2018-06-25 14:46:50,Twokinds,"When it rains, it pours."
819,2018-06-25 14:49:51,Twokinds,I've made an appeal.
820,2018-06-25 14:50:06,Twokinds,We'll see what they end up deciding.
825,2018-06-25 14:52:07,Twokinds,"yeah, I don't like how they've chosen to handle this."
827,2018-06-25 14:52:28,Twokinds,"Some forewarning would be appreciated, instead of surprising people with it at 3am."
837,2018-06-25 14:58:22,Twokinds,"I don't even use Paypal through the,."
838,2018-06-25 14:58:31,Twokinds,Through Patreon.
841,2018-06-25 14:59:18,Twokinds,"At the end of the day, what is considered 'too sexy' will always be subjective."
857,2018-06-25 16:00:33,Twokinds,"Worst comes to worse, I'll just have to label anything too risque as ""Patron Only"" so only those subscribed can see it. And then put those sketches up on Deviantart as well or something."
868,2018-06-25 16:06:43,Twokinds,I hope they're reasonable.
997,2018-06-25 20:35:03,Twokinds,Patreon is back.

125,2018-06-30 14:48:09,Twokinds,Takis are a rolled chip. They're spicy!
129,2018-06-30 14:48:20,Twokinds,They aren't stingy with the spicy powder like other chips.
168,2018-06-30 14:52:27,Twokinds,lol it's not THAT spicy.
169,2018-06-30 14:52:50,Twokinds,"I just think they taste very good, and have just the right amount. But then again I'm not really a great judge."
175,2018-06-30 14:53:30,Twokinds,They're great though. I wish I could just order the powder by itself.
177,2018-06-30 14:53:39,Twokinds,I'd but an entire tub of the stuff.

11,2018-07-14 11:55:45,Twokinds,Dragons are pretty rare.
16,2018-07-14 12:06:31,Twokinds,I guess
42,2018-07-14 12:23:54,Twokinds,Of course they can.
45,2018-07-14 12:24:49,Twokinds,Why not? That's like asking if they can get piercings.
46,2018-07-14 12:24:51,Twokinds,Of course they can.
66,2018-07-14 12:43:03,Twokinds,-miss-

132,2018-07-14 13:23:02,Twokinds,"Difficult? No, easy! It worked for my brother and me! Everyone should quit their jobs and follow their dreams~! :sparkles:"
139,2018-07-14 13:25:20,Twokinds,I don't see why not.
141,2018-07-14 13:26:01,Twokinds,"I'll probably be drawing until I'm 100. The next 100, maybe I'll work on something else then."
164,2018-07-14 13:30:53,Twokinds,lol
168,2018-07-14 13:31:09,Twokinds,I've never been able to stop smoking.
169,2018-07-14 13:31:20,Twokinds,Cause I never started.
176,2018-07-14 13:32:15,Twokinds,My dad used to smoke a lot. Camels.
188,2018-07-14 13:33:37,Twokinds,"I won't lie, I like the smell of Camel cigarettes. To this day it always brings back memories from childhood."
203,2018-07-14 13:36:16,Twokinds,"There are always outliers, but I'd never bet my life on it. The statistics are not in anyone's favor."
207,2018-07-14 13:37:17,Twokinds,"Exercise, don't smoke, don't drink excessively."
215,2018-07-14 13:38:36,Twokinds,It'd be nice if I could both draw and excerise.
216,2018-07-14 13:38:48,Twokinds,That's the biggest issue for me. Art takes so much of my time.
385,2018-07-14 14:30:19,Twokinds,Me too!

1544,2018-07-14 15:54:10,Twokinds,"Yes, but it's not only fur"
1898,2018-07-14 16:12:55,Twokinds,"The crab cannot be stopped, only contained. For now."

1927,2018-07-14 16:13:29,Twokinds,I wanted to do a slightly different take on the standard beach pinup
1936,2018-07-14 16:13:49,Twokinds,"I figured, the best time for a snowmom to have the beach to herself, is during winter!"
2255,2018-07-14 16:27:23,Twokinds,sure
2295,2018-07-14 16:31:21,Twokinds,I unfortunately forgot to take pictures of a lot of them

4034,2018-07-14 18:16:07,Twokinds,Hm...
4035,2018-07-14 18:16:13,Twokinds,Yeah that might have been cute too
4057,2018-07-14 18:17:30,Twokinds,I don't have designs for that sketch!

4614,2018-07-14 18:59:41,Twokinds,Clovis is just short
4621,2018-07-14 19:00:00,Twokinds,Even as a guy he was only 5'6 which is really small for a wolf.

5461,2018-07-14 22:48:38,Twokinds,Maybe it was Rose's.
17,2018-07-15 10:16:24,Twokinds,Morning!
22,2018-07-15 10:20:53,Twokinds,My biggest issue is that designing a dragon is a lot of effort.
23,2018-07-15 10:21:04,Twokinds,It's not something easy to do on the spot during a stream.
24,2018-07-15 10:21:23,Twokinds,I would have to invent a dragon and a princess.
26,2018-07-15 10:27:04,Twokinds,I do like the suggestion
27,2018-07-15 10:27:10,Twokinds,But I'll need more preperation
28,2018-07-15 10:27:17,Twokinds,Perhaps next week when I'm not streaming sketches
31,2018-07-15 10:30:55,Twokinds,Yes
49,2018-07-15 10:54:30,Twokinds,They'd be silhouettes
51,2018-07-15 11:00:02,Twokinds,"Hm, doesn't matter"
62,2018-07-15 11:29:41,Twokinds,wow
65,2018-07-15 11:30:40,Twokinds,:O
66,2018-07-15 11:30:48,Twokinds,metadata?
80,2018-07-15 11:59:54,Twokinds,"I just got my passport recently, after having it go missing about a decade ago."
82,2018-07-15 13:09:02,Twokinds,Ys
84,2018-07-15 13:11:38,Twokinds,I don't remember.
85,2018-07-15 13:11:46,Twokinds,I think I lost it on the plane during a return flight.
86,2018-07-15 13:11:54,Twokinds,Just left it in the seat pocket.
90,2018-07-15 13:14:44,Twokinds,Yeah in 10 years
91,2018-07-15 13:14:50,Twokinds,My new one will expire in 2028
94,2018-07-15 13:15:06,Twokinds,No I just finally got a new one.
99,2018-07-15 13:15:18,Twokinds,"I have no idea what happened to the old one, but I never went overseas again, so..."
100,2018-07-15 13:15:25,Twokinds,Eh it didn't really matter
101,2018-07-15 13:15:32,Twokinds,But I'm going to Korea this year. So I needed a new one.
105,2018-07-15 13:16:26,Twokinds,West Korea
106,2018-07-15 13:16:49,Twokinds,Visiting family
108,2018-07-15 13:24:48,Twokinds,"I wish passports were slightly smaller, so I could fit it in my wallet."
114,2018-07-15 15:59:21,Twokinds,QUaCK
120,2018-07-15 19:04:14,Twokinds,"I thought about adding it, but I kept finding cards that had different numbers on them"
121,2018-07-15 19:04:27,Twokinds,So I didn't want to risk using the wrong one.
122,2018-07-15 19:11:02,Twokinds,I'm going to be running a brief stream test.
195,2018-07-15 19:31:03,Twokinds,Yeah it's choppy
197,2018-07-15 19:31:16,Twokinds,That's because I'm streaming over wifi from a mobile device
199,2018-07-15 19:31:25,Twokinds,That's what the stream test is.
219,2018-07-15 19:32:46,Twokinds,Twitch no has multistream
254,2018-07-15 19:35:35,Twokinds,This is probably not a good stream to be new in as this is not a stream
261,2018-07-15 19:35:48,Twokinds,I am just running some tests to see how it handles streaming
294,2018-07-15 19:38:12,Twokinds,Okay I'm going now
297,2018-07-15 19:38:23,Twokinds,Goodbye!
311,2018-07-15 19:38:45,Twokinds,Could you guys hear the music?
322,2018-07-15 19:39:16,Twokinds,I can't display music because that requires Chrome to be open and it can't handle Chrome at the same time as photoshop and firefox...
327,2018-07-15 19:39:50,Twokinds,Firefox displays chat
329,2018-07-15 19:40:12,Twokinds,"I can't remember why I don't use Chrome for chat, but there was some issue with it"
336,2018-07-15 19:41:16,Twokinds,But then... how am I supposed to chat back?
342,2018-07-15 19:41:34,Twokinds,Well I am right now
351,2018-07-15 19:42:32,Twokinds,nothing
363,2018-07-15 19:44:18,Twokinds,"There was no stream, I was just running a test of some settings."
368,2018-07-15 19:46:04,Twokinds,"Hm, image quality seems okay from those screenshots, considering the bitrate was a lower."
376,2018-07-15 19:46:40,Twokinds,"Well, jumpy can't be helped. There were no dropped frames."
377,2018-07-15 19:46:46,Twokinds,It's just a less powerful device.
379,2018-07-15 19:46:57,Twokinds,"I might try adjusting some settings, see if that helps."
404,2018-07-15 19:52:41,Twokinds,Yeah just seeing if I might be able to do a primative stream at SDCC
411,2018-07-15 19:53:11,Twokinds,Yeah perhaps
419,2018-07-15 19:54:29,Twokinds,Although most hotels I've stayed at in San Diego have ethernet cables
420,2018-07-15 19:54:39,Twokinds,Though I still am not confident in their connections.
421,2018-07-15 19:54:45,Twokinds,ESPECIALLY during Comic Con
427,2018-07-15 19:55:26,Twokinds,"yeah, it's a fancy hotel"
428,2018-07-15 19:55:31,Twokinds,So no free wifi
434,2018-07-15 19:55:46,Twokinds,The more expensive the hotel the less you get
455,2018-07-15 19:57:59,Twokinds,I wouldn't go otherwise
478,2018-07-15 20:01:06,Twokinds,lol
482,2018-07-15 20:01:43,Twokinds,It's a little sea of people
483,2018-07-15 20:02:00,Twokinds,You'll see
492,2018-07-15 20:03:05,Twokinds,It can take half an hour or more to get from one side of the convention hall to the other.
499,2018-07-15 20:03:55,Twokinds,XD
516,2018-07-15 20:06:45,Twokinds,lol yeah
517,2018-07-15 20:10:36,Twokinds,I have my doubts I'll get a comic out this week
518,2018-07-15 20:10:39,Twokinds,but I'll try
519,2018-07-15 20:10:56,Twokinds,I've preloaded all my patreon and deviantart posts for now
521,2018-07-15 20:12:19,Twokinds,On the 18th. So... a day and a half from now.
523,2018-07-15 20:13:20,Twokinds,I could but I'd have to work on it
525,2018-07-15 20:13:30,Twokinds,"Knowing cons, dunno if I'll have the energy."
533,2018-07-15 20:14:30,Twokinds,Fresh pots!
538,2018-07-15 20:15:02,Twokinds,Don't you see the stream? I'm streaming right now.
554,2018-07-15 20:18:05,Twokinds,Oh yeah
556,2018-07-15 20:18:10,Twokinds,Depends on the person
559,2018-07-15 20:18:51,Twokinds,"Hm, you probably could, but you'd need to be prepared to wait in line for a couple hours or more"
561,2018-07-15 20:19:10,Twokinds,"You might get lucky though. I don't know, I've never tried waiting in line for something like that."
564,2018-07-15 20:19:49,Twokinds,I need to pick up the special edition lego sets at the con
566,2018-07-15 20:20:01,Twokinds,"My cousins want them, so I gotta get like 8 sets"
567,2018-07-15 20:20:05,Twokinds,Apparently
570,2018-07-15 20:20:13,Twokinds,"I dunno anything about Lego, just know they want em"
573,2018-07-15 20:20:24,Twokinds,No you gotta wait in line for them
574,2018-07-15 20:20:30,Twokinds,That's your job for me at the convention.
580,2018-07-15 20:20:49,Twokinds,lol
581,2018-07-15 20:20:59,Twokinds,I doubt the lines at lego are as large as signings
585,2018-07-15 20:21:09,Twokinds,8 sets
587,2018-07-15 20:21:15,Twokinds,I've seen the lego booth
589,2018-07-15 20:21:29,Twokinds,"It's big, they got lots of booths"
591,2018-07-15 20:21:35,Twokinds,lots of registers
594,2018-07-15 20:21:52,Twokinds,lol
596,2018-07-15 20:22:13,Twokinds,"You might not have to, I'll probably try to sneak there on Wed and see if I can nab em"
600,2018-07-15 20:22:40,Twokinds,They got a huge game section
601,2018-07-15 20:22:44,Twokinds,Probably demos to play
606,2018-07-15 20:23:12,Twokinds,Yeah perks of being an exibitor
607,2018-07-15 20:23:16,Twokinds,Early access

144,2018-07-18 23:15:46,Twokinds,But screen is just fundimentally better.
145,2018-07-18 23:15:57,Twokinds,"Funds, though, is the key word."
152,2018-07-18 23:17:20,Twokinds,I've never used a Huion. I've heard they're pretty good.

91,2018-07-29 01:22:08,Twokinds,Probably... not. The royal family kinda... use her. Having a dragon is very prestigous.
94,2018-07-29 01:23:12,Twokinds,But she doesn't really have royal athority. It's a mostly empty title.

104,2018-07-29 01:25:51,Twokinds,There are isolated human colonies ruled by a dragon. But that's because human settlers moved to an island owned by a dragon first.
106,2018-07-29 01:26:48,Twokinds,Nah
107,2018-07-29 01:27:02,Twokinds,Just regular settlers.

113,2018-07-29 01:30:00,Twokinds,Haha XD
115,2018-07-29 01:31:29,Twokinds,Well the dragon keeps pretty much any other monster or outside group from threatening them.
116,2018-07-29 01:31:34,Twokinds,Just by being there.
122,2018-07-29 01:33:29,Twokinds,Yeah they're not connected with the rest of the human empire
123,2018-07-29 01:33:44,Twokinds,Probably in a few hundred years they'll turn into their own citystate and then country.
127,2018-07-29 01:34:51,Twokinds,Yeah
129,2018-07-29 01:36:16,Twokinds,"No, not really."

133,2018-07-29 01:36:43,Twokinds,Dragons always make dragons.

190,2018-07-29 01:47:12,Twokinds,Adrakists are almost all complete imitations
191,2018-07-29 01:47:16,Twokinds,phonies
192,2018-07-29 01:47:23,Twokinds,It's just for looks
198,2018-07-29 01:48:14,Twokinds,"I mean, that's not to say it can't be effective. Sarah's skin is quite strong."
200,2018-07-29 01:48:38,Twokinds,The transformations are substantial. But they're trying to be dragon. They aren't actually dragon.
201,2018-07-29 01:48:40,Twokinds,If you know what I mean.
208,2018-07-29 01:49:46,Twokinds,"No, there are Keidran Adrakists."
209,2018-07-29 01:49:58,Twokinds,No Basitin ones.
215,2018-07-29 01:51:04,Twokinds,"There's actually a small group of Adrakist fanatics (oxymoron) who's figurehead is actually a lizardfolk, and not an Adrakist at all."
217,2018-07-29 01:51:30,Twokinds,"Which is a little funny, because Lizardfolk in the Twokinds world aren't as intellegent as Keidran or Humans."
218,2018-07-29 01:51:43,Twokinds,"So, it kinda doesn't know what's going on."
223,2018-07-29 01:52:26,Twokinds,"I mean, he rolls with it."
227,2018-07-29 01:53:49,Twokinds,Sssh

234,2018-07-29 01:55:53,Twokinds,Uh... I hadn't thought of that.
235,2018-07-29 01:56:07,Twokinds,I don't know!
237,2018-07-29 01:56:13,Twokinds,Yes
238,2018-07-29 01:56:14,Twokinds,Sure
240,2018-07-29 01:56:26,Twokinds,Tigers don't trade slaves.
243,2018-07-29 01:56:40,Twokinds,And the cat tribe are completely buffered by the tigers.
246,2018-07-29 01:57:09,Twokinds,"Most humans haven't seen one, though they do exist outside of their territory in tiny numbers."
247,2018-07-29 01:57:12,Twokinds,G'night!

253,2018-07-29 01:58:47,Twokinds,Oh yes
254,2018-07-29 01:58:50,Twokinds,Quite a lot
263,2018-07-29 02:01:37,Twokinds,Don't be late!
277,2018-07-29 02:08:14,Twokinds,"Well, I always say, everythign is canon - until it's contradicted in the comic."
281,2018-07-29 02:09:15,Twokinds,Impossible? Well... lots of things.
284,2018-07-29 02:09:40,Twokinds,"Magic still needs knowledge, in Twokinds. So, curing infection through magic is impossible until mages know what causes infection."
291,2018-07-29 02:13:07,Twokinds,A lot of magic is just limited by creativity. The rest is just the energy required to do it.
298,2018-07-29 02:14:57,Twokinds,"Yeah, he had a bigger well to draw from, especiaally after trying to resurrect Saria."
300,2018-07-29 02:16:13,Twokinds,Yup
304,2018-07-29 02:17:06,Twokinds,True but there's a little to how much you can draw. Drawing is a lot slower than using your own reserves.
305,2018-07-29 02:17:18,Twokinds,limit*
309,2018-07-29 02:18:08,Twokinds,Mana reserve is like a waterballoon. Black magic is like filling the waterballoon with acid that weakens the rubber so it gets bigger.
310,2018-07-29 02:18:18,Twokinds,Until it pops.
316,2018-07-29 02:19:14,Twokinds,lol reds just bad at both

494,2018-08-30 21:02:10,Twokinds,And the rest wear cloaks and turtlenecks so when I'm lazy I can just draw them entirely covered up
516,2018-08-30 21:04:26,Twokinds,Uh...

116,2018-09-01 14:56:02,Twokinds,stream will be 4:30
209,2018-09-01 15:10:45,Twokinds,arg
219,2018-09-01 15:11:09,Twokinds,"SCPilot, Palmetto, I reject your suggestion for being too hard to draw!"
230,2018-09-01 15:11:42,Twokinds,"6 characters, full bodies, three original"
233,2018-09-01 15:11:46,Twokinds,No no no
264,2018-09-01 15:14:32,Twokinds,Well I only usually read the first sentence of every suggestion
269,2018-09-01 15:14:39,Twokinds,Then delete everything else
281,2018-09-01 15:15:50,Twokinds,Well it's just so detailed
284,2018-09-01 15:16:07,Twokinds,"It's a good suggestion, but these kids are pretty much OCs"
287,2018-09-01 15:16:25,Twokinds,Which is also against the rules
293,2018-09-01 15:17:01,Twokinds,I'm kidding about the one sentence thing
297,2018-09-01 15:17:15,Twokinds,"Just if it's really long, I go cross-eyed after a while"
299,2018-09-01 15:17:25,Twokinds,Like some suggestions are 6-7 paragraphs
309,2018-09-01 15:17:58,Twokinds,Yes don't do that please
316,2018-09-01 15:18:35,Twokinds,Well I made those kids up
327,2018-09-01 15:19:20,Twokinds,Yeah I have to crop all the suggestions so it fits in the polling thing
329,2018-09-01 15:19:32,Twokinds,"And then, at that point, it's all I see of it..."
336,2018-09-01 15:20:08,Twokinds,Not really
348,2018-09-01 15:20:58,Twokinds,I've never said that
349,2018-09-01 15:21:06,Twokinds,If you changed it now I'd put it in
360,2018-09-01 15:21:55,Twokinds,I can still do Flora and Sythe have a family
364,2018-09-01 15:22:12,Twokinds,It's just probably not going to be exactly all the details you included
467,2018-09-01 15:30:34,Twokinds,No one ever suggests it
547,2018-09-01 15:35:39,Twokinds,No

1209,2018-09-01 16:36:13,Twokinds,I am going to do this sketch later :D
1215,2018-09-01 16:36:25,Twokinds,because it refuses to come out of my pen at the moment :D
1225,2018-09-01 16:36:59,Twokinds,Sometimes the art just doesn't flow right away
1347,2018-09-01 16:51:47,Twokinds,"I feel bad, these drawings aren't coming out well at all."
1348,2018-09-01 16:51:54,Twokinds,I'm having some trouble today.
1359,2018-09-01 16:52:27,Twokinds,"Obvious not, I'm just having some coordination issues."
1579,2018-09-01 17:10:31,Twokinds,Nothing so far
1580,2018-09-01 17:10:40,Twokinds,Stop saying that Blue
1614,2018-09-01 17:14:24,Twokinds,"I think unfortunately, I'm going to have to take a sick day."
1623,2018-09-01 17:14:54,Twokinds,"I will stream later this evening or tomorrow, when my hand feels like cooperating more"
1635,2018-09-01 17:15:36,Twokinds,remember to do note about unusual stream time
1650,2018-09-01 17:16:12,Twokinds,Sorry about that
1657,2018-09-01 17:16:29,Twokinds,"Man, dunna what's going on. Maybe low blood sugar or something"
1668,2018-09-01 17:16:59,Twokinds,I don't wanna force it and make people's suggestions look crappy.
1670,2018-09-01 17:17:11,Twokinds,I always want to draw my best if possible
1684,2018-09-01 17:17:54,Twokinds,You missed me being really bad at drawing!
1717,2018-09-01 17:20:02,Twokinds,Whoops
1719,2018-09-01 17:20:11,Twokinds,I also forgot to post today's drawing
1768,2018-09-01 17:24:05,Twokinds,Whoops
1770,2018-09-01 17:24:12,Twokinds,I forgot to make it Patreon Only
1773,2018-09-01 17:24:23,Twokinds,"I don't know if it needs to be but just in case, dun want Patreon to get mad"
1882,2018-09-01 17:35:07,Twokinds,I'll try! I'm really dizzy...
1947,2018-09-01 17:48:03,Twokinds,Yes
1949,2018-09-01 17:48:05,Twokinds,All 7
1992,2018-09-01 18:00:06,Twokinds,Home remedies are much cheaper
1999,2018-09-01 18:01:21,Twokinds,That's why I've never been to the hospital
2008,2018-09-01 18:01:58,Twokinds,I haven't even seen my doctor in 10 years
2018,2018-09-01 18:02:35,Twokinds,Never get sick
2020,2018-09-01 18:02:46,Twokinds,"If you get sick, ignore it until it goes away"
2046,2018-09-01 18:05:14,Twokinds,I do have health insurance now
2053,2018-09-01 18:05:28,Twokinds,"Which is rediculous. It's the biggest expense I pay, and I never even use it."
2065,2018-09-01 18:06:05,Twokinds,Eh
2067,2018-09-01 18:06:11,Twokinds,Why would I get a checkup if there's nothing wrong
2102,2018-09-01 18:09:43,Twokinds,I feel terrible for the people living there
2104,2018-09-01 18:10:00,Twokinds,It's terrifying to think your money can just suddenly become worthless
2129,2018-09-01 18:12:57,Twokinds,Not tonight
2131,2018-09-01 18:13:04,Twokinds,Probably
2139,2018-09-01 18:13:26,Twokinds,I'll see how I feel when my food arrives
2151,2018-09-01 18:14:00,Twokinds,Chicken curry
2152,2018-09-01 18:14:04,Twokinds,From an indian resturant
2175,2018-09-01 18:16:42,Twokinds,"Man, now I'm hungry from some curry"
2210,2018-09-01 18:21:18,Twokinds,oh no
2212,2018-09-01 18:21:37,Twokinds,I still don't know what to do with mine
2215,2018-09-01 18:21:54,Twokinds,Yeah
2216,2018-09-01 18:22:01,Twokinds,I'm headed to Korea on the 19th
2218,2018-09-01 18:22:14,Twokinds,It'll cost $300 to set her up in a cat hotel
2223,2018-09-01 18:23:23,Twokinds,Yeah Holly is terrified of other people and aninmals
2225,2018-09-01 18:23:45,Twokinds,She will not be happy to spend two weeks in an unfamiliar setting
2229,2018-09-01 18:24:06,Twokinds,"Unfortunately, I don't have anyone who could really do that"
2233,2018-09-01 18:24:17,Twokinds,I don't have any friends.
2239,2018-09-01 18:24:42,Twokinds,"Mark lives in California, and will also be in Korea too"
2245,2018-09-01 18:27:31,Twokinds,I don't know Bob or Wade
2309,2018-09-01 18:40:56,Twokinds,I don't think my cat has her vaccinations up to date
2320,2018-09-01 18:43:58,Twokinds,Can it just be Freya and Flora?
2321,2018-09-01 18:44:07,Twokinds,That would make it a lot easier
2326,2018-09-01 18:44:49,Twokinds,Final Flora 9
2340,2018-09-01 18:47:27,Twokinds,fod has rived
2458,2018-09-01 19:00:16,Twokinds,I might ask my stepmother if she or anyone she knows can stop in a couple times to check on her
2460,2018-09-01 19:00:29,Twokinds,This curry is really good...
2670,2018-09-01 19:33:55,Twokinds,I don't feel so good
2675,2018-09-01 19:34:21,Twokinds,So much curry...
2700,2018-09-01 19:38:58,Twokinds,Wow I am really out of step today
2701,2018-09-01 19:39:05,Twokinds,I forgot to post the art to dA
2717,2018-09-01 19:42:32,Twokinds,wow the da post broke
2721,2018-09-01 19:43:13,Twokinds,Is anyone else seeing it
2722,2018-09-01 19:43:18,Twokinds,the lack of thumbnail
2731,2018-09-01 19:43:48,Twokinds,Apparently nothing is working for me today

2988,2018-09-01 21:28:03,Twokinds,Not particularly
2989,2018-09-01 21:33:56,Twokinds,I am familiar with Western Comics from movies and media
2990,2018-09-01 21:34:11,Twokinds,Mostly through internet reviewers
2991,2018-09-01 21:34:24,Twokinds,But I never took much of an interest in them as a kid.
2996,2018-09-01 21:45:05,Twokinds,The first I remember?
2997,2018-09-01 21:45:12,Twokinds,Probably My Neighbor Totoro
3156,2018-09-01 23:29:10,Twokinds,Need assistance
3158,2018-09-01 23:35:18,Twokinds,What do you imagine Trace and Rose's first meeting was like
3161,2018-09-01 23:36:27,Twokinds,Well I honestly had no idea
3168,2018-09-01 23:38:17,Twokinds,Yeah
3182,2018-09-01 23:42:21,Twokinds,Trace was just a kid when Rose and Saria met
3183,2018-09-01 23:42:32,Twokinds,Saria was much older than Trace
3184,2018-09-01 23:43:29,Twokinds,So Rose and Saria would have already been living together for a while by the time she started dating Trace.
3188,2018-09-01 23:43:58,Twokinds,"Remember, when Rose was being hanged, Trace was there"
3189,2018-09-01 23:44:01,Twokinds,He was a little kid
46,2018-09-02 00:27:15,Twokinds,I can't believe you've done this

119,2018-09-02 13:51:31,Twokinds,Where is it snowing?
123,2018-09-02 13:53:33,Twokinds,It's 91 degrees here
125,2018-09-02 13:56:26,Twokinds,It's a little warm yeah
130,2018-09-02 13:59:24,Twokinds,Good luck!

204,2018-09-02 15:08:55,Twokinds,Looking forward to the dlc
217,2018-09-02 15:15:15,Twokinds,Just the sense of exploration
218,2018-09-02 15:15:21,Twokinds,I went into it blind'
232,2018-09-02 15:17:55,Twokinds,I'm glad it wasn't multiplayer
240,2018-09-02 15:18:46,Twokinds,There are so many early access open world survival crafting games
242,2018-09-02 15:19:01,Twokinds,It's just nice to have a solitary experience once in a while.
254,2018-09-02 15:20:07,Twokinds,"Sure, but multiplayer survival games are usually designed around the expectation"
255,2018-09-02 15:20:21,Twokinds,I wouldn't mind if multiplayer was added after the fact.
441,2018-09-02 19:46:10,Twokinds,When's the stream?
457,2018-09-02 19:49:18,Twokinds,When should I stream

790,2018-09-02 20:44:58,Twokinds,Done
801,2018-09-02 20:46:14,Twokinds,These pages will be going up as sketches
805,2018-09-02 20:46:35,Twokinds,"So I can put as much detail as I want into the backgrounds, and coloring them will be future Tom's problem."
813,2018-09-02 20:47:31,Twokinds,Well I'm sure I'll go back and color them eventually
814,2018-09-02 20:47:42,Twokinds,But for now they're sketches
818,2018-09-02 20:48:19,Twokinds,Doing sketch side comics is a lot faster than doing color comics
819,2018-09-02 20:48:21,Twokinds,That's for sure
870,2018-09-02 21:01:19,Twokinds,I celebrated by not doing any work

1056,2018-09-02 21:51:49,Twokinds,Yes my hand is a lot less dumb today

132,2018-09-06 01:18:38,Twokinds,I feel like that makes sense. If you're gunna get Mcd you'd probably just get it yourself.

159,2018-09-06 01:25:05,Twokinds,Though I do prefer Goldstar
162,2018-09-06 01:26:42,Twokinds,"It's basically spaghetti with chili, and then toped with a boatload of cheese."

190,2018-09-06 01:29:28,Twokinds,I usually drown it in RedHot
193,2018-09-06 01:30:17,Twokinds,It's not American cheese. I think it's sharp cheddar.
212,2018-09-06 01:32:53,Twokinds,"Huh, I never heard of those"
214,2018-09-06 01:33:07,Twokinds,I'd have definitely tried it. Though I do just prefer the regular mcdoubles.
218,2018-09-06 01:33:54,Twokinds,Especially back when you could get two for a dollar. That was great.
219,2018-09-06 01:34:03,Twokinds,"I would order like, 10 of them."

370,2018-09-12 22:55:11,Twokinds,So what happens is that a website will redirect to another page

373,2018-09-12 22:55:28,Twokinds,So you end up in an loop.
376,2018-09-12 22:55:52,Twokinds,Which is why it seems like it's trapping you. You just have to right click the back button and tell it to go back two spots.

137,2018-09-17 04:26:01,Twokinds,But she's always been clothed in all the scenes they're together in.
141,2018-09-17 04:27:12,Twokinds,She was wearing Natani's robe

3386,2018-10-13 20:11:39,Twokinds,Why wouldn't I?!

3409,2018-10-13 20:13:13,Twokinds,Did you know there's only 1 sketch in the entire patreon that has Red but not Raine as well?
3412,2018-10-13 20:13:25,Twokinds,ALL the other ones have Raine in it with him.
3451,2018-10-13 20:20:57,Twokinds,I never did finish it
3452,2018-10-13 20:21:05,Twokinds,I wasn't happy with how it was coming out
3461,2018-10-13 20:23:15,Twokinds,The issue was I never had any real idea of how they met
3462,2018-10-13 20:23:22,Twokinds,And it's hard to come up with something on the spot.
3498,2018-10-13 20:27:04,Twokinds,I hate power outages
3499,2018-10-13 20:27:08,Twokinds,We get them so often

45,2018-10-14 09:17:45,Twokinds,It's a tactics style game.
48,2018-10-14 09:18:22,Twokinds,"It's a bit ""looser"" than most tactics games, which makes it pretty unique in my opinion."
50,2018-10-14 09:18:40,Twokinds,You move and interact via ranges rather than grids.
51,2018-10-14 09:18:57,Twokinds,Which leads to some manipulation of the system if you're clever enough
57,2018-10-14 09:20:43,Twokinds,Way looser than Rabbids. Rabbids is pretty strict with it's numbers.

407,2018-10-14 10:51:51,Twokinds,Just magicked to look like the outside.

3,2018-10-23 12:59:18,Twokinds,Hello all
5,2018-10-23 13:08:47,Twokinds,Okay I guess.

615,2018-10-25 21:09:21,Twokinds,Done
648,2018-10-25 21:11:06,Twokinds,"When I post it I'll attach a version without the canvas, and with the canvas seperate."
657,2018-10-25 21:11:45,Twokinds,"""with the canvas seperate"" = this one"
662,2018-10-25 21:12:05,Twokinds,Why would I do that
667,2018-10-25 21:12:24,Twokinds,I...
669,2018-10-25 21:12:28,Twokinds,Reread what I said.
672,2018-10-25 21:12:44,Twokinds,"With canvas, without canvas, and with the painting seperate."
675,2018-10-25 21:12:47,Twokinds,Figure it out.
729,2018-10-25 21:16:48,Twokinds,XD
732,2018-10-25 21:16:57,Twokinds,The memory of a Nora becomes itself a Nora
748,2018-10-25 21:17:45,Twokinds,"I mean, it was partially just a gag, but I don't really want to say anything difinitive one way or another. I guess it could be interpretted as either a telepathic communication, or some sort of mental trap."
773,2018-10-25 21:20:01,Twokinds,"I actually considered going back and editing an old page temporarily, just to see if anyone went looking"
777,2018-10-25 21:20:23,Twokinds,But it wouldn't really fit anywhere. The convo doesn't exactly line up.
798,2018-10-25 21:22:07,Twokinds,"It's weird, I remember sketching this."
803,2018-10-25 21:22:30,Twokinds,I drew it at a convention in Florida.
814,2018-10-25 21:23:03,Twokinds,It feels like yesterday.
816,2018-10-25 21:23:13,Twokinds,But then I remember that was in 2009. Almost a decade ago.
962,2018-10-25 21:37:11,Twokinds,THANKS :D
968,2018-10-25 21:39:15,Twokinds,We're the same age then!
1014,2018-10-25 21:46:39,Twokinds,Thanks for reading :)
1041,2018-10-25 21:49:36,Twokinds,How's this?
1067,2018-10-25 21:51:43,Twokinds,I used to read dozens of webcomics
1069,2018-10-25 21:51:53,Twokinds,"Sadly, nowadays it's only like... 3"
1084,2018-10-25 21:53:51,Twokinds,I swear I've sneezed a hundred times today
1092,2018-10-25 21:54:50,Twokinds,I'm not sick. Just been having lots of sneezing fits. Dunno.
1106,2018-10-25 21:56:08,Twokinds,Nicht... much
1184,2018-10-25 22:04:50,Twokinds,Yes.

1368,2018-10-25 22:27:02,Twokinds,spooky
1405,2018-10-25 22:30:22,Twokinds,I know how that feels
1539,2018-10-25 22:43:20,Twokinds,Done
1718,2018-10-25 23:05:48,Twokinds,ew no
1773,2018-10-25 23:16:37,Twokinds,I've never gotten eye strain.
1785,2018-10-25 23:17:51,Twokinds,lol
1790,2018-10-25 23:18:17,Twokinds,I stare at a screen literally every waking moment. It doesn't affect me.
1814,2018-10-25 23:20:38,Twokinds,"Uh, I don't see how that's unbelievable."
1820,2018-10-25 23:21:18,Twokinds,I don't get eye strain from screens.
1831,2018-10-25 23:21:57,Twokinds,"In fact, I don't think people really get eye strain from screens."
1933,2018-10-25 23:35:08,Twokinds,It's getting late for me too.
1935,2018-10-25 23:35:26,Twokinds,"I think with Reni inked, I'm calling it for now too."
1937,2018-10-25 23:35:41,Twokinds,"Sorry, Sage. ^^; I'm still on a regular sleep schedule."
1955,2018-10-25 23:36:36,Twokinds,"Oh man, the peer pressure"

6,2018-10-26 00:00:36,Twokinds,"Okay! 1am, I think that's good enough for me."
14,2018-10-26 00:00:57,Twokinds,We got a lot done tonight
46,2018-10-26 00:04:55,Twokinds,Should be fun. White dress on black scales.
484,2018-10-26 18:23:09,Twokinds,"As she travels, Magpie retells legends from Twokinds, but is always getting them wrong."
492,2018-10-26 18:27:22,Twokinds,"""Keith returned to the Basitin islands... for revenge!"""
87,2018-10-27 12:00:00,Twokinds,Good afternoon!
91,2018-10-27 12:01:32,Twokinds,We'll finally get an uninterrupted sketch stream today.

407,2018-10-27 15:18:38,Twokinds,Finished drawing that dust and fidget sketch just a few minutes ago.
408,2018-10-27 15:18:44,Twokinds,So sorry for the delay but we're here now!
421,2018-10-27 15:19:48,Twokinds,Time for round 1?
443,2018-10-27 15:22:26,Twokinds,I have 3 minutes to eat
444,2018-10-27 15:22:29,Twokinds,Haven't eaten yet
467,2018-10-27 15:25:42,Twokinds,Yes! Made a sandwich in time!
476,2018-10-27 15:26:11,Twokinds,How did I know this would win XD
535,2018-10-27 15:32:21,Twokinds,oi ROBIT
574,2018-10-27 15:36:08,Twokinds,eurgh
575,2018-10-27 15:36:14,Twokinds,I inhaled the entire sandwich
586,2018-10-27 15:36:36,Twokinds,It was good though
591,2018-10-27 15:36:55,Twokinds,Should have chewed more. I almost choked XD
842,2018-10-27 15:55:39,Twokinds,ʰᵉᶜᵏ
1086,2018-10-27 16:13:15,Twokinds,Wacom glitches out sometimes
1089,2018-10-27 16:13:20,Twokinds,Makes random spot
1107,2018-10-27 16:14:49,Twokinds,"You're right, Zen will have to disguise himself as a guy. On top of as a girl."

1940,2018-10-27 17:45:51,Twokinds,"They told me this massage technique was forbidden, but I didn't listen."
1944,2018-10-27 17:46:00,Twokinds,"Oh well, more material for my outfits!"
2046,2018-10-27 17:56:57,Twokinds,Don
2335,2018-10-27 18:27:19,Twokinds,Done
2648,2018-10-27 19:09:15,Twokinds,I wish I was back with food
2669,2018-10-27 19:11:24,Twokinds,"Well she is a Keidran, so yeah, basically."
2678,2018-10-27 19:12:16,Twokinds,I'm done for now
2696,2018-10-27 19:13:02,Twokinds,No
2785,2018-10-27 19:22:22,Twokinds,Mrs Nibbly is designed to match a lot of rythems
2892,2018-10-27 19:34:40,Twokinds,Done
2909,2018-10-27 19:35:40,Twokinds,It's the default photoshop round brush
2935,2018-10-27 19:38:39,Twokinds,"Huh, two people asked for the same thing"
2972,2018-10-27 19:41:14,Twokinds,lol
2975,2018-10-27 19:41:34,Twokinds,I guess they want a double body swap?
2981,2018-10-27 19:41:52,Twokinds,"Although, if I include them wearing the costumes, that's 8 people + nora"
2997,2018-10-27 19:42:38,Twokinds,I'll try it!
3334,2018-10-27 20:29:20,Twokinds,Yeah I'm going to clean it up later but for now it's going to be very sloppy
3416,2018-10-27 20:38:32,Twokinds,Done
3487,2018-10-27 20:44:28,Twokinds,"Like I said, I'll probably clean this up more"
3488,2018-10-27 20:44:31,Twokinds,"but for now, the recap"
3504,2018-10-27 20:45:39,Twokinds,I'll probably finish this

3702,2018-10-27 21:11:59,Twokinds,I am back with another sandwich
3707,2018-10-27 21:15:35,Twokinds,It's a... ham? sandwich on sandwich bread
3708,2018-10-27 21:16:38,Twokinds,With mustard mayo and ketchup
3714,2018-10-27 21:18:04,Twokinds,Of course ketchup!
3715,2018-10-27 21:18:09,Twokinds,Just like on steak
3719,2018-10-27 21:19:03,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
3727,2018-10-27 21:24:45,Twokinds,It's meat. It came in a box.
3731,2018-10-27 21:25:38,Twokinds,I don't ask questions. Delicious suspicious meat.
3735,2018-10-27 21:27:09,Twokinds,"But seriously, I bought both ham and turkey, and I can't remember which container I got the meat from."
3738,2018-10-27 21:27:31,Twokinds,And I can't tell the difference because of all the ketchup.
3743,2018-10-27 21:32:52,Twokinds,"Well, there definitely ketchup in this sandwich."
3744,2018-10-27 21:33:02,Twokinds,And mayo.
3745,2018-10-27 21:33:10,Twokinds,"The more flavor the better, that's always my motto."
3749,2018-10-27 21:36:07,Twokinds,:O!
3750,2018-10-27 21:36:12,Twokinds,No ketchup on fries?!
3755,2018-10-27 21:37:02,Twokinds,And you say I'm weird.
3760,2018-10-27 21:38:28,Twokinds,I know!
3761,2018-10-27 21:38:34,Twokinds,Plain fries are so much worse!
3826,2018-10-27 21:59:46,Twokinds,I agree with you there
3827,2018-10-27 21:59:50,Twokinds,Can't drink
3910,2018-10-27 22:40:25,Twokinds,cheeese
3913,2018-10-27 22:40:41,Twokinds,:cheese:
3919,2018-10-27 22:44:03,Twokinds,Nope. I don't have a console.
3923,2018-10-27 22:44:32,Twokinds,"And I've been really busy getting stuff done. If I get the chance, I'll play next month."
12,2018-10-28 12:08:45,Twokinds,The sketches are going to be posted slightly out of order. I'd like to cluster all the halloween related ones around the holiday.
14,2018-10-28 12:10:33,Twokinds,"I know, I'm sorry!"
21,2018-10-28 12:41:50,Twokinds,Oh!
22,2018-10-28 12:42:27,Twokinds,"Wow... uh, my red dead ps4 arrived just now. It wasn't supposed to arrive yet."
24,2018-10-28 12:42:41,Twokinds,"Aw, now it's going to be sitting here cause I can't play it. XD"
28,2018-10-28 12:43:29,Twokinds,Haha yeah
29,2018-10-28 12:43:35,Twokinds,The halloween presents
33,2018-10-28 12:47:57,Twokinds,I heard there was a bit of a texture smudging issue on the ps4 pro
35,2018-10-28 12:48:18,Twokinds,Something about the way it filtered stuff.
36,2018-10-28 12:48:22,Twokinds,I dunno.
38,2018-10-28 12:48:44,Twokinds,I don't even have a tv that can do anything over 1080p
147,2018-10-28 13:51:40,Twokinds,yes please
148,2018-10-28 13:52:41,Twokinds,Give me choices and skill checks back.
154,2018-10-28 14:05:14,Twokinds,"In New Vegas, for example, there's a quest where cannibals ask for help, but only if you're evil, have high speech, or find clues. You can expose them, help them, find replacement meat, and unique dialogue if you're a cannabal too."
155,2018-10-28 14:05:21,Twokinds,There are multiple ways to fail and several alternate ways to succeed. I feel like this sort of thing was sorely lacking in Fallout 4.
156,2018-10-28 14:08:51,Twokinds,"Obviously a video game can't really capture all the possibilities like in D&D, but I appreciate it when they try."
160,2018-10-28 14:19:02,Twokinds,nooooo
161,2018-10-28 14:19:12,Twokinds,Although I can't imagine having that many tabs
163,2018-10-28 14:20:55,Twokinds,I start feeling bad when the tabs get so crowded they start to shrink
164,2018-10-28 14:21:00,Twokinds,Then I have to do some culling
220,2018-10-28 17:42:37,Twokinds,"Mmm, dinner"
221,2018-10-28 17:42:49,Twokinds,I miss home cooked food.
225,2018-10-28 17:49:03,Twokinds,...Most of my food comes from cans.
226,2018-10-28 17:49:23,Twokinds,Does a microwaved can of soup count as home cooked?
274,2018-10-28 19:02:34,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-katandflo:
327,2018-10-28 20:40:49,Twokinds,hey
332,2018-10-28 20:43:23,Twokinds,Good
333,2018-10-28 20:43:25,Twokinds,Thanks for the suggestion!
336,2018-10-28 20:44:19,Twokinds,I do too
339,2018-10-28 20:45:45,Twokinds,Thanks!
346,2018-10-28 20:48:33,Twokinds,I'm almost always here.
522,2018-10-28 22:56:51,Twokinds,I would fear designing a character with a tattoo knowing that I'd have to draw it all the time.
523,2018-10-28 22:58:02,Twokinds,Flora's fur pattern is bad enough.
571,2018-10-28 23:22:45,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-NoraEyebrows:
576,2018-10-28 23:24:03,Twokinds,Oh?
578,2018-10-28 23:24:24,Twokinds,"Okay, I'll add Kiwi to Scythe Sythe"
603,2018-10-28 23:31:24,Twokinds,Yeah multiple people suggesting the same thing happens quite a bit
604,2018-10-28 23:31:27,Twokinds,I don't mind it
606,2018-10-28 23:31:47,Twokinds,It's nice being able to get 2 or more people's suggestions at once
0,2018-10-29 00:09:39,Twokinds,Nibbly at the center of a turducken.
8,2018-10-29 00:23:26,Twokinds,Probably not. Anything involving all the characters would be too much for a suggestion
16,2018-10-29 00:34:13,Twokinds,OH CRAP

28,2018-10-30 10:04:36,Twokinds,It's pretty popular in the US
29,2018-10-30 10:05:03,Twokinds,"Prooobably the third most popular holiday, behind Christmas and Thanksgiving."
36,2018-10-30 11:43:33,Twokinds,"You know, it's funny, we never get trick or treaters, because we're on a tiny street with only four houses."
37,2018-10-30 11:43:40,Twokinds,I don't know what I'd do if someone actually showed up.
38,2018-10-30 11:43:50,Twokinds,I guess I'd have to give them some Korean candy.
44,2018-10-30 12:07:16,Twokinds,My cat is asleep and it's snoring sounds like an alarm set to vibrate is going off.
45,2018-10-30 12:07:32,Twokinds,I keep checking my phone thinking I'm getting a ton of messages or something.

2504,2018-11-03 18:52:01,Twokinds,Because I won't allow it.
2689,2018-11-03 19:07:18,Twokinds,Maybe?

3581,2018-11-03 20:24:32,Twokinds,I think there's only ever been one double before...
3582,2018-11-03 20:24:36,Twokinds,Either that or this is the first.

4340,2018-11-03 23:57:56,Twokinds,That way you don't end up with a huuuge page that might glitch out at any moment and make you start all over again.

329,2018-11-08 18:50:53,Twokinds,But Basitin ears make their heads so wide that it's almost inevitable that their ears go over the line.
345,2018-11-08 18:53:29,Twokinds,I should do a panel gag where the ears are hitting the edge of the border.
353,2018-11-08 18:59:46,Twokinds,I hate when songs add a bunch of unnecessary bs at the beginning or end
354,2018-11-08 19:00:18,Twokinds,"Like, I don't need to hear a song open with the mechanical sounds of a jukebox picking out the disk and slowly putting it in before starting."
355,2018-11-08 19:00:40,Twokinds,It's cliche
366,2018-11-08 19:04:38,Twokinds,"I also hate it when a song is REALLY good, but then, right near the end, before they do the last 1/3, they insert a vocal. Darn it, no other voice in the whole thing, and you ruin it."

395,2018-11-08 19:11:31,Twokinds,I liked the song but I hated that one part. So I just snipped it out with Audacity.
397,2018-11-08 19:12:01,Twokinds,Matched the ends up so the cut isn't too obvious though I'm not great at audio editing. It was a very basic hack job..

548,2018-11-09 01:40:43,Twokinds,twenty dollars seems like a lot for coffee.
554,2018-11-09 01:43:56,Twokinds,But for twenty dollars you could get 3 months worth of coffee.
556,2018-11-09 01:44:02,Twokinds,Just have to make it yourself.
559,2018-11-09 01:45:35,Twokinds,I don't know how to use those
562,2018-11-09 01:46:15,Twokinds,But you still have to set everything up beforehand.
564,2018-11-09 01:46:34,Twokinds,I don't have that kind of forethought.
566,2018-11-09 01:47:01,Twokinds,I use coffee packets. They have the cream and sugar and coffee all in the packet.
567,2018-11-09 01:47:04,Twokinds,Just add water.

683,2018-11-09 02:01:36,Twokinds,"One packet, everything inside, and it actually tastes good. At least to me."
685,2018-11-09 02:02:05,Twokinds,The only issue with them is that I need two packets per cup.
686,2018-11-09 02:02:10,Twokinds,Cause... I like coffee.

3134,2018-11-10 20:03:58,Twokinds,Considering he doesn't normally wear one

3628,2018-11-10 20:57:51,Twokinds,Lots of people worship Nora
3642,2018-11-10 20:59:11,Twokinds,Adrakists usually worship dragons in general. And specifically any nearby or ones they've met.
3657,2018-11-10 21:00:28,Twokinds,"A lot of Adrakists aren't as fanatical as Sarah. Many are normal people who just appreciate dragons, or are people who were saved or know someone saved by a dragon."
3669,2018-11-10 21:01:50,Twokinds,Adrakist just refers to anyone who worships dragons. The zealots like Sarah that transform themselves to look like dragons usually give the rest a bad name.
3683,2018-11-10 21:02:37,Twokinds,lol
3782,2018-11-10 21:08:17,Twokinds,That's how basitins work

4295,2018-11-10 22:12:07,Twokinds,I'm sure it'll get picked eventually.
4297,2018-11-10 22:14:08,Twokinds,Yeah I don't think there's a lot of fighting game players

173,2018-11-15 01:48:14,Twokinds,Oh! No wonder I couldn't find it
176,2018-11-15 01:48:34,Twokinds,All those sketches were in the comic psd for the page I later drew in that stream
187,2018-11-15 01:53:44,Twokinds,"You know, the comic psds probably contain a lot of draft sketches and different versions of panels that are just lost to time."
188,2018-11-15 01:54:08,Twokinds,Cause sometimes I'll just doodle while trying to come up with ideas

258,2018-11-15 10:49:38,Twokinds,Most of my time was inside a convention.
259,2018-11-15 10:49:44,Twokinds,So I never saw much of the city.
261,2018-11-15 11:19:48,Twokinds,"I'm not sure about that. I went to Pittsburg and it was really nice, I thought."
262,2018-11-15 11:20:04,Twokinds,Quite different than other cities I've been in. A lot less busy.
265,2018-11-15 11:43:04,Twokinds,yes
268,2018-11-15 12:05:31,Twokinds,I spent two weeks in a town south of Frankfurt and then two weeks in München. I also visited Salzburg.

330,2018-11-15 19:11:13,Twokinds,My pen nib was so worn down it started becoming warped.
332,2018-11-15 19:11:25,Twokinds,It was causing my lines to be inaccurate.

4922,2018-11-17 22:41:43,Twokinds,"It's your sketch suggestion, does it count?"

11,2018-11-18 00:50:15,Twokinds,True. It's probably unlikely I've eaten deer.
12,2018-11-18 00:50:22,Twokinds,I wouldn't be opposed to trying it.

386,2018-11-18 18:50:42,Twokinds,It's fleece. Basically a long towel with sleeves.
387,2018-11-18 18:51:23,Twokinds,But it'll be warm when the temp drops
392,2018-11-18 18:53:23,Twokinds,heheheh
393,2018-11-18 18:55:22,Twokinds,"I also bought a fleece blanket and comfortor for my bed. Queen size, despite only having a twin. I'm gunna go full hiberation. Not going to be cold this winter."

409,2018-11-18 19:00:43,Twokinds,XD
411,2018-11-18 19:00:46,Twokinds,NOOOOOOOOOO
413,2018-11-18 19:01:41,Twokinds,"The nice thing about having a twin bed is that queen sized blankets are, oddly, usually the same price as twin."
414,2018-11-18 19:01:52,Twokinds,So you can just get a bigger one and then just double it up if you're still cold.
415,2018-11-18 19:02:12,Twokinds,I'm guessing it's because queen is the most common size or something?

446,2018-11-18 21:35:58,Twokinds,Haha
447,2018-11-18 21:36:34,Twokinds,I just set up all the sketches for the next week to post automatically. That feels nice. Good to get it out of the way.
452,2018-11-18 21:41:22,Twokinds,Noon
456,2018-11-18 21:42:00,Twokinds,"And yeah. It's really what I should do. Unfortunately, I'm sometimes lazy, which ends up costing my more time in the long run."
457,2018-11-18 21:42:20,Twokinds,Because I make the Patreon post and the thumbnail on the website each day. Instead of all in one go.
460,2018-11-18 21:46:21,Twokinds,yeah my biggest hinderence in always doing it is that I often touch up sketches after the stream
461,2018-11-18 21:46:27,Twokinds,And that takes a lot of time.
462,2018-11-18 21:46:38,Twokinds,"But this week the sketches were pretty good as is, so it didn't take long."
464,2018-11-18 21:50:02,Twokinds,lol yeah usually

565,2018-11-18 23:55:29,Twokinds,"I once planned to write a comedy about a guy who travelled around ending up in ridiculous romantic situations with various creatures. One of them was a ghost, that he later comes back to and finds out she's had kids."

585,2018-11-18 23:58:43,Twokinds,I've seen a little of it

17,2018-11-19 00:02:35,Twokinds,Yeah nah
19,2018-11-19 00:02:54,Twokinds,"Not exactly a great anime to watch for the plot. Or... is, depending on your definition of plot."
43,2018-11-19 00:05:38,Twokinds,It went on foreeever
53,2018-11-19 00:06:51,Twokinds,That jewel sure to shatter into a lot of pieces
60,2018-11-19 00:07:42,Twokinds,"Uh, yeah, I saw episodes whenever I caught it on tv"
63,2018-11-19 00:07:59,Twokinds,"And I think I had some of the manga. I never watched it all the way through, no."
65,2018-11-19 00:08:21,Twokinds,This was back in the day when it was really hard for me to get ahold of entire sets of anime.
67,2018-11-19 00:08:32,Twokinds,I always had like the first couple disks or books of everything.
85,2018-11-19 00:12:14,Twokinds,"Trigun was an anime I saw very little of, it was always just in the periphery of my childhood."
89,2018-11-19 00:12:31,Twokinds,"Fooly cooly, yeah. Saw all of that, since it was so short."
92,2018-11-19 00:12:44,Twokinds,Anyone remember the other trippy anime
93,2018-11-19 00:12:47,Twokinds,What was it...
101,2018-11-19 00:13:05,Twokinds,"No, but I did see that. I have the dvd!"

108,2018-11-19 00:13:30,Twokinds,I actually really liked that anime. I don't remember why.
111,2018-11-19 00:13:38,Twokinds,The theme song was great though. I remember that.
191,2018-11-19 01:24:05,Twokinds,Well this is new
192,2018-11-19 01:24:27,Twokinds,I completed a sketch I started almost exactly a year ago.
196,2018-11-19 01:30:40,Twokinds,Nora has trouble walking on two legs.
199,2018-11-19 01:31:50,Twokinds,Yeah I meant to but the sketch wasn't finished during stream and I never got back around to it.
202,2018-11-19 01:32:17,Twokinds,Recently?
204,2018-11-19 01:32:26,Twokinds,Yeah
206,2018-11-19 01:32:29,Twokinds,"Funny thing is, the person who suggested it isn't even a sketch suggestor anymore."

247,2018-11-19 01:37:22,Twokinds,It's today's sketch
259,2018-11-19 01:40:06,Twokinds,That one was one of my favorites.
264,2018-11-19 01:40:33,Twokinds,There's also another sketch that could be described the same way
266,2018-11-19 01:40:39,Twokinds,But with natani flipping Zen off
272,2018-11-19 01:41:16,Twokinds,What are my favorites? That one
273,2018-11-19 01:41:25,Twokinds,I was really happen doing the background of it
276,2018-11-19 01:41:40,Twokinds,Also I was listening to a post apocolypic audiobook while working on it.
280,2018-11-19 01:42:03,Twokinds,"I don't know why, but if I was doing anything else while working on a long piece, I can tell you what it was."
285,2018-11-19 01:42:53,Twokinds,"Like, while playing subnautica, I was listening to an audiobook about finance."
286,2018-11-19 01:42:59,Twokinds,I just know that.
287,2018-11-19 01:43:04,Twokinds,"Why,I don't know."
292,2018-11-19 01:43:55,Twokinds,"yeah it was fun, because other than being terrifying, Subnautica is pretty chill"
295,2018-11-19 01:44:21,Twokinds,You wouldn't think so
300,2018-11-19 01:44:48,Twokinds,"I like to multitask. I feel like if I'm playing a game but not also learning stuff, I'm wasting my time. So often I'll listen to financial podcasts and stuff."
304,2018-11-19 01:45:44,Twokinds,"Eh, Dave Ramsey I've listened to a lot of his stuff."
305,2018-11-19 01:46:06,Twokinds,"I don't find it very applicable for me, because he deals mostly in debt management, which is not an issue I have, thankfully."
306,2018-11-19 01:46:16,Twokinds,But it is interesting listening to some of the success stories.
307,2018-11-19 01:46:25,Twokinds,I woldn't take investing advice from him.
311,2018-11-19 01:48:27,Twokinds,Which one was it?
314,2018-11-19 01:48:49,Twokinds,Oh
315,2018-11-19 01:48:52,Twokinds,That was a vote
319,2018-11-19 01:50:11,Twokinds,"Seven, one for each day of the week"
324,2018-11-19 01:51:24,Twokinds,That seems about right
326,2018-11-19 01:51:46,Twokinds,"My ""Sunday Sketch"" folder of just the pngs is 482 MB"
329,2018-11-19 01:52:37,Twokinds,Oh in that case my folder is 58.5GB

340,2018-11-19 01:56:31,Twokinds,Tiny? D:
341,2018-11-19 01:56:35,Twokinds,It's not that tiny...
342,2018-11-19 01:56:45,Twokinds,I used to post at 600 x 800
345,2018-11-19 01:57:11,Twokinds,"You know, back in the day, I was told that if a comic page was over 200kb, that was too much."
347,2018-11-19 01:57:21,Twokinds,"And it was true, it was really slow to load each page!"
351,2018-11-19 01:57:49,Twokinds,"Well I wasn't on keenspot at the time, but the keenspace forums"
354,2018-11-19 01:57:57,Twokinds,Back when I was asking people for advice on how to make a webcomic
360,2018-11-19 01:58:43,Twokinds,"Next comic I do, for sure, it'll be higher res"
362,2018-11-19 01:58:53,Twokinds,And I'll probably use a slightly taller page format
363,2018-11-19 01:59:01,Twokinds,Maybe Standard comic size
371,2018-11-19 02:03:48,Twokinds,Mmhm
372,2018-11-19 02:03:53,Twokinds,Tech has just moved so much
373,2018-11-19 02:04:42,Twokinds,Back when I started I had to worry about people with monitors of 640 x 480
374,2018-11-19 02:04:55,Twokinds,That's why I chose 600x width originally. So it'd fit on those monitors.
377,2018-11-19 02:05:15,Twokinds,People don't like to scroll sideways.

625,2018-11-19 19:11:09,Twokinds,lol It's not like I didn't wash them.
630,2018-11-19 19:13:43,Twokinds,They were really wearing down in the middle. Color completely faded. I'm sure one day a hole would've been worn completely through them.
631,2018-11-19 19:14:31,Twokinds,So good to get something completely new finally.

660,2018-11-19 20:29:20,Twokinds,lol
661,2018-11-19 20:30:10,Twokinds,What I do is use one of those fine-tooth fur brushes and a handheld vaccuum. More effective on fabric and don't have to spend an arm and leg on lint rollers.
662,2018-11-19 20:30:38,Twokinds,"But seriously, Holly is a cat fur factory."
670,2018-11-19 20:44:07,Twokinds,"You know what's funny is I literally took one of the pillow cases, made of the same fleece fabric, put it on a pillow and put that in Holly's usual sleeping spot."
671,2018-11-19 20:44:12,Twokinds,It's the same material!
672,2018-11-19 20:44:16,Twokinds,And yet she goes for my bed.
674,2018-11-19 20:47:49,Twokinds,I can't though.
675,2018-11-19 20:48:05,Twokinds,She's so relaxed. I can't interrupt that.

75,2018-11-21 10:32:34,Twokinds,ten hours seems pretty normal for me but I hate the loss of productive time

81,2018-11-21 10:34:32,Twokinds,I managed to just get almost five
82,2018-11-21 10:34:38,Twokinds,So I think you took some of my hours

108,2018-11-21 12:19:00,Twokinds,So I ran around closing everything again and turn the heat back on. X_x

116,2018-11-21 12:30:11,Twokinds,My house is maintained at 20C
119,2018-11-21 12:33:50,Twokinds,It's not cold. It's... pretty reasonable
120,2018-11-21 12:34:00,Twokinds,Any more and it'd be too hot.
131,2018-11-21 12:54:54,Twokinds,Well if you're keeping it at 77 I would think so!
132,2018-11-21 12:55:00,Twokinds,77 would be too hot for me.
146,2018-11-21 14:44:35,Twokinds,Yeah what a bunch of weirdos!

287,2018-11-21 18:31:32,Twokinds,I always did find it kind of ridiculous
295,2018-11-21 18:32:49,Twokinds,"If I was a cranberry canner, I would at least intent the can with like, thanksgiving shapes or something. But I guess that would be way more expensive than just a standard can."

1088,2018-11-23 14:38:35,Twokinds,Black friday got me.
1091,2018-11-23 14:40:23,Twokinds,12 pack of sharpies. 4 dollars.
1102,2018-11-23 14:44:53,Twokinds,33¢ each
1105,2018-11-23 14:47:31,Twokinds,Seemed like a good deal.
1106,2018-11-23 14:47:39,Twokinds,I do always need pens.
1107,2018-11-23 14:48:07,Twokinds,I lose them all the time.
1108,2018-11-23 14:48:22,Twokinds,"I once bought a 50 pack of pens so that if I lost the one I was using, I could just get another one from the box."
1109,2018-11-23 14:48:30,Twokinds,"50 pens later, the box is empty. I can't find the pens."
1111,2018-11-23 14:49:31,Twokinds,Usually 50 - 1 dollar.
1114,2018-11-23 14:49:53,Twokinds,Silver ones are the most expensive. And it's the ones I use the most for signing.
1116,2018-11-23 14:57:17,Twokinds,"The worst part is, the times I've bought a huge box of them, they're all worthlessly dried out."
1120,2018-11-23 14:57:51,Twokinds,The blister pack of pens are the only ones that consistantly work for me.
1152,2018-11-23 15:16:19,Twokinds,Gotta tell the stomach to get it's act together.
1153,2018-11-23 15:17:02,Twokinds,Stop having acid where it doesn't belong.

1341,2018-11-23 16:30:20,Twokinds,There's never enough time
1346,2018-11-23 16:32:07,Twokinds,It's especially hard during winter because there's just no sun
1347,2018-11-23 16:32:13,Twokinds,Except when I don't want it
1348,2018-11-23 16:32:24,Twokinds,It's always dark
1358,2018-11-23 16:37:00,Twokinds,Yeah I'm looking at lamps now
1360,2018-11-23 16:37:10,Twokinds,My floor lamp broke months ago and I haven't replace it
1366,2018-11-23 16:39:06,Twokinds,I don't know?
1397,2018-11-23 16:54:59,Twokinds,I really need a new pc one day
1399,2018-11-23 16:55:17,Twokinds,That can support stuff like that.

21,2018-11-24 11:35:28,Twokinds,I wish I could gift subs
22,2018-11-24 11:36:07,Twokinds,Dunno why Picarto doesn't allow this.
36,2018-11-24 12:18:15,Twokinds,I dunno about that
37,2018-11-24 12:18:27,Twokinds,If everyone could gift each other subs I think it'd encourage subs
39,2018-11-24 12:19:46,Twokinds,? I don't follow you.
41,2018-11-24 12:21:00,Twokinds,I don't know Twitch
44,2018-11-24 12:21:22,Twokinds,I don't know. Doesn't have to.
46,2018-11-24 12:24:34,Twokinds,If I could gift subs I'd start giving them out like candy XD
52,2018-11-24 12:29:43,Twokinds,Why? More money for Picarto.
53,2018-11-24 12:29:51,Twokinds,I don't see a downside.
57,2018-11-24 12:34:00,Twokinds,"Right now, picarto gets 5% of every sub. So, every sub I give costs me 25 cents. Sure, I miss out on the other 4.75 but perhaps someone likes having the sub and then subs later. Or gives someone else a sub."
59,2018-11-24 12:34:57,Twokinds,I think it'd encourage people to participate more. Thus giving Picarto more revenue than they would otherwise.
63,2018-11-24 12:35:59,Twokinds,Heheh
64,2018-11-24 12:36:16,Twokinds,It's just a thought. I think I'll try bringing the idea up with Picarto.
299,2018-11-24 14:35:24,Twokinds,Beautiful ^^XD
305,2018-11-24 14:51:17,Twokinds,Yeah probably wouldn't want to show everything to someone too young XD
307,2018-11-24 14:54:42,Twokinds,Quite possibly if I can get the free time to make it happen.
315,2018-11-24 15:03:02,Twokinds,I said I MIGHT.
316,2018-11-24 15:03:07,Twokinds,I never promised anything.

3828,2018-12-01 23:26:38,Twokinds,I will try to go back and fix it up a little to make it more Halo-y. lol
3834,2018-12-01 23:27:04,Twokinds,I'm afraid I'm not as familiar with Halo as I am with many other games.
3848,2018-12-01 23:29:40,Twokinds,I was using the female varient of this concept art for Halo Reach as reference: https://www.writeups.org/wp-content/uploads/MJOLNIR-Armor-HALO-video-game-Bungie-h.jpg
3850,2018-12-01 23:29:53,Twokinds,I will try to find better references for the helmet.

336,2018-12-02 10:58:36,Twokinds,The overarching story is plotted out. The details of what happens in each chapter is done chapter-by-chapter.
338,2018-12-02 11:04:04,Twokinds,lol
339,2018-12-02 11:04:11,Twokinds,It's more than it just takes me a long time to tell it
340,2018-12-02 11:08:16,Twokinds,That's why I'm slowly programming Alexa to be my personal assistant. So I can keep better track of time.
342,2018-12-02 11:22:53,Twokinds,Just embracing the inevitable!
346,2018-12-02 12:30:43,Twokinds,Welp
349,2018-12-02 12:32:12,Twokinds,Seems Tumblr has decided they want to go down in flames.
351,2018-12-02 12:34:00,Twokinds,"Apparently, they announced they'll be banning all adult content Dec 17."
353,2018-12-02 12:34:39,Twokinds,"I don't use Tumblr at all, but I feel like that's not a good idea."
359,2018-12-02 12:41:12,Twokinds,I'm honestly worries more sites will start to follow suit as the 'professional' side of the web tries to become more sanitized.
360,2018-12-02 12:41:40,Twokinds,Patreon feels like it's trying to go the same way.
386,2018-12-02 12:56:29,Twokinds,lol no
387,2018-12-02 12:56:59,Twokinds,"I do not like that Tumblr doesn't have comments, or any way to easily browse old stuff."
388,2018-12-02 12:57:24,Twokinds,Honestly it's always baffled me why people liked it so much.
389,2018-12-02 12:57:58,Twokinds,"Reading people react to stuff is half the fun of online posts, for me."
392,2018-12-02 13:00:22,Twokinds,"What's the point of the little dropdown, where you can scroll through the name of every person who ever liked something, one at a time?"
393,2018-12-02 13:01:14,Twokinds,Seems useless.

529,2018-12-02 15:09:23,Twokinds,Better to just double them up.

597,2018-12-02 15:37:51,Twokinds,I'm not sure yet how work will be split up
599,2018-12-02 15:38:29,Twokinds,"But likely I will do the writing, designs, characters. They would be doing layout and art."
602,2018-12-02 15:39:10,Twokinds,"Yeah I've got tons of ideas, but not the time to make them happen."
604,2018-12-02 15:39:40,Twokinds,"So, while it will be my character designs, the art style probably won't be exactly the same. But I will of course be looking for someone who can get close."
606,2018-12-02 15:40:35,Twokinds,"Yeah, of course. This would be to free up time so I can keep doing other stuff."
632,2018-12-02 15:50:04,Twokinds,No absolutely not

717,2018-12-02 16:26:00,Twokinds,Raine is human. She was made from two human parents.
719,2018-12-02 16:26:18,Twokinds,That's how the loophole worked with Euchre. His special ability was perfect transformation.
722,2018-12-02 16:27:06,Twokinds,"Raine has it too, it's just repressed and buggy due to her bad upbringing."
725,2018-12-02 16:31:03,Twokinds,Well it would be hard science fiction
726,2018-12-02 16:31:21,Twokinds,But it would be about a journey through space

84,2018-12-03 13:35:52,Twokinds,And then maybe they like it and keep subbing. Or give a sub to someone else.

215,2018-12-05 15:23:34,Twokinds,What's a Halo?
217,2018-12-05 15:24:14,Twokinds,I'm a PC gamer. I played Halo 1 sometime in 2002 or 2003. And that was it.
219,2018-12-05 15:24:21,Twokinds,So it's been a while.
222,2018-12-05 15:24:55,Twokinds,I THINK I played Halo 3 multiplayer back in the day.

230,2018-12-05 15:27:31,Twokinds,I'm not really someone who obsesses over one game. And I never got into MMOs.
231,2018-12-05 15:27:40,Twokinds,So I don't have crazy thousands of hours in anything.
233,2018-12-05 15:28:17,Twokinds,Yeah.
236,2018-12-05 15:28:40,Twokinds,"According to Steam, the most hours in any one game was Skyrim, but that's not really accurate."
237,2018-12-05 15:28:55,Twokinds,New Vegas has a lot of hours that weren't counted. I'm sure I have more in that game.
239,2018-12-05 15:29:40,Twokinds,Morrowind I probably have a crazy amount of hours in over my lifetime.
246,2018-12-05 15:33:05,Twokinds,You get pretty good at calculating weight / value

92,2018-12-12 08:47:05,Twokinds,Morning
93,2018-12-12 08:47:10,Twokinds,Oh Sage was here
98,2018-12-12 09:29:35,Twokinds,GOOD MORNING
101,2018-12-12 09:29:58,Twokinds,"Reasonably well. I only got 7 hours, but I feel fine."
103,2018-12-12 09:30:20,Twokinds,Still no coffee. I am now taking caffeine in tablets.
105,2018-12-12 09:30:46,Twokinds,It's been good so far. I am glad I've cut back on sugar.
107,2018-12-12 09:30:56,Twokinds,Yeah Sage has a really bad sleep schedule.
113,2018-12-12 09:37:08,Twokinds,"""Why"""
114,2018-12-12 09:37:24,Twokinds,And I quit coffee because of the high amount of sugar I was eating.
116,2018-12-12 09:37:57,Twokinds,"I cannot have black coffee, because I don't want to, so I stopped drinking coffee."
117,2018-12-12 09:38:32,Twokinds,"I was drinking 3 cups of coffee, which is ~285mg of caffeine."
118,2018-12-12 09:38:43,Twokinds,The caffeine tablet is only 100mg of caffeine.
120,2018-12-12 09:38:57,Twokinds,An almost 1/3 decrease.
122,2018-12-12 09:39:22,Twokinds,"Er, 2/3 decrease"
125,2018-12-12 09:52:58,Twokinds,Honestly pretty true
128,2018-12-12 09:53:58,Twokinds,The tablets are just to slowly wean off the stuff so I don't get headaches.

379,2018-12-12 19:18:58,Twokinds,It took a few minutes. It's only shifting pixels around.
380,2018-12-12 19:19:29,Twokinds,Though it did take a little trial and error to get it to loop naturally
384,2018-12-12 19:49:56,Twokinds,Anyone read any good books lately
410,2018-12-12 20:07:41,Twokinds,I'm starting an audible trial
411,2018-12-12 20:07:47,Twokinds,And I get two books
412,2018-12-12 20:08:05,Twokinds,I already know 1 I want.
413,2018-12-12 20:08:10,Twokinds,The other is up in the air.
417,2018-12-12 20:10:59,Twokinds,Ew old
419,2018-12-12 20:11:24,Twokinds,Also I already read it
448,2018-12-12 21:16:05,Twokinds,"With audible, do credits build up, or do they expire at the end of the month?"
450,2018-12-12 21:16:24,Twokinds,Ah
451,2018-12-12 21:16:28,Twokinds,I don't think I'd want to use Audible
453,2018-12-12 21:16:52,Twokinds,"Seems like I'd be way better off just buying audio books as I want them, and I'd probably end up spending less money."
457,2018-12-12 21:18:41,Twokinds,But 1 per month is so little
458,2018-12-12 21:18:52,Twokinds,"Like, you listen to a book for 1 day, and then you're done."

104,2018-12-15 12:22:41,Twokinds,Yeah for the small little hockey puck thing
105,2018-12-15 12:22:53,Twokinds,The old one is 25 and the new ones are 30
107,2018-12-15 12:24:01,Twokinds,"Actually, the old dots are on sale for 20 right now. Must be getting rid of their inventory."
109,2018-12-15 12:27:03,Twokinds,"They do have more expensive ones with better speakers or with screens, but it's not really necessary."
110,2018-12-15 12:27:12,Twokinds,They can intigrate with any smartphone.
111,2018-12-15 12:27:34,Twokinds,I'm sure Amazon sells them at near cost just to get people into the ecosystem.
112,2018-12-15 12:27:44,Twokinds,That's how they get ya.

229,2018-12-15 15:34:00,Twokinds,I'm sure I'd be completely lost with the new stuff.
231,2018-12-15 15:34:20,Twokinds,Yeah
242,2018-12-15 15:35:00,Twokinds,I still can't understand those weird cards with the arrows and different conditions on them
250,2018-12-15 15:35:29,Twokinds,"I mean, it was the original trading card game"
253,2018-12-15 15:35:48,Twokinds,It's what yu-gi-oh and pokemon are inspired by.
300,2018-12-15 15:41:26,Twokinds,Is arena new?
302,2018-12-15 15:41:41,Twokinds,Is it online only?

333,2018-12-15 15:49:04,Twokinds,"Cause I have never bought in game items for any game, and I would not want to start."
335,2018-12-15 15:49:17,Twokinds,Well that sounds more reasonable.
338,2018-12-15 15:49:25,Twokinds,Maybe I will give it a shot then.

254,2018-12-16 13:19:11,Twokinds,"But go one block, and it's the poor neighborhood."
256,2018-12-16 13:19:24,Twokinds,It's weirdly right next to each other.

267,2018-12-16 13:21:51,Twokinds,I think it's related.
268,2018-12-16 13:22:13,Twokinds,"Best locations get the best schools, which get the best service, which attracts people, then business, and value goes up."
269,2018-12-16 13:22:17,Twokinds,It's a circle.

466,2018-12-16 18:26:02,Twokinds,"My sewing is not pretty, but well, they're pajama pants that go with my bath robe. So I don't care how they look."

44,2018-12-17 00:23:02,Twokinds,I don't know
46,2018-12-17 00:23:08,Twokinds,Probably just an open call?
47,2018-12-17 00:23:18,Twokinds,I need to get people who aren't crap at writing
49,2018-12-17 00:23:47,Twokinds,So it can't just be anyone
50,2018-12-17 00:24:10,Twokinds,Obviously they'd have to understand Twokinds and it's characters and style of humor
51,2018-12-17 00:24:22,Twokinds,But they'd also have to be good at writing a complete narrative

70,2018-12-28 00:22:05,Twokinds,Yeah rows of soldiers
75,2018-12-28 00:23:04,Twokinds,Stratego!
76,2018-12-28 00:23:07,Twokinds,"Found it, finally."
81,2018-12-28 00:23:47,Twokinds,"Huh, really? I thought it was more popular."
84,2018-12-28 00:24:02,Twokinds,"Sage, you don't?"
85,2018-12-28 00:24:43,Twokinds,lol
86,2018-12-28 00:25:30,Twokinds,?
89,2018-12-28 00:25:41,Twokinds,Stairs?
94,2018-12-28 00:26:19,Twokinds,...Does it?
96,2018-12-28 00:26:41,Twokinds,I've always thought spazz was pretty harmless.
97,2018-12-28 00:27:13,Twokinds,"Well, yeah, but it's kinda jokey negative"
115,2018-12-28 00:32:56,Twokinds,I hate drawing action
123,2018-12-28 00:33:41,Twokinds,lol
125,2018-12-28 00:34:15,Twokinds,I gotta draw this big lizard lizarding around in action
127,2018-12-28 00:34:22,Twokinds,"Well, paint."
130,2018-12-28 00:34:30,Twokinds,"See, I don't know how to put action together."
131,2018-12-28 00:34:40,Twokinds,"Like, sequentially. So it 'flows' or whatever"
135,2018-12-28 00:35:33,Twokinds,I wanted to give the lizard an otherworldly quality by styling it differently.
137,2018-12-28 00:35:51,Twokinds,"Sorta unsettling to make it seem like it's still part of the scenery, even as it's moving."
140,2018-12-28 00:36:47,Twokinds,"Also, it's good painting practice."
144,2018-12-28 00:37:19,Twokinds,"I like doing things different, just to challenge myself and keep up my own interest."
148,2018-12-28 00:37:37,Twokinds,The whole comic is a learning experience.
150,2018-12-28 00:38:51,Twokinds,"Yeah, and once TK is done, I can start my first REAL comic!"
152,2018-12-28 00:39:00,Twokinds,XD

580,2018-12-28 17:12:45,Twokinds,That's weird. That was one of the names I considered for the stone lizard.
589,2018-12-28 17:13:48,Twokinds,Well now I'm sad the name's already taken.

242,2018-12-29 15:53:15,Twokinds,I'll get to as many as I can.
250,2018-12-29 15:54:12,Twokinds,Any left over will be done off stream.
261,2018-12-29 15:55:21,Twokinds,Because I'm not here tomorrow
297,2018-12-29 15:57:51,Twokinds,Just want to give everyone time to get their notifications
