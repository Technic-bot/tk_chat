128,2017-10-24 20:04:57,Twokinds,Hello!
129,2017-10-24 20:05:02,Twokinds,I'll be streaming in just a little bit
140,2017-10-24 20:07:16,Twokinds,Wednesday streams are the least... official of the three
144,2017-10-24 20:07:48,Twokinds,Indeed. Although I did enjoy taking the last two days break.
146,2017-10-24 20:08:02,Twokinds,I used it to finally finish Disgaea 5.
148,2017-10-24 20:08:13,Twokinds,It was a much needed rest.
153,2017-10-24 20:08:37,Twokinds,Disgaea 5 is a very Japanese tactical rpg game.
157,2017-10-24 20:09:13,Twokinds,"The story is... garbage. xD But it's very addictive, gameplay wise."
165,2017-10-24 20:12:20,Twokinds,The main character is a blue-haired guy who is constantly battling a dark version of himself in his mind from a past after his ex-lover was killed.

555,2017-10-26 21:22:10,Twokinds,This stuff is so stressful
561,2017-10-26 21:22:51,Twokinds,It's stressful because there's never enough time.

913,2017-10-26 22:05:45,Twokinds,Obviously it works. Has anyone heard of anybody turning to stone recently?

985,2017-10-26 22:26:51,Twokinds,"Like tattoos and body mods irl, getting magically modified isn't unheard of in the Twokinds world, though it is considered deviant behavior."

4284,2017-10-28 19:07:52,Twokinds,"It can be played single player, but it's also a lot of fun with each character in the party controlled by a person."
4295,2017-10-28 19:08:31,Twokinds,Depends on how well you work together.
4305,2017-10-28 19:09:11,Twokinds,We once managed to one-shot an enemy by all attacking it at the exact same time before combat started.
4311,2017-10-28 19:09:30,Twokinds,But then there's times when we don't work together and it goes south
4323,2017-10-28 19:10:00,Twokinds,Yeah but well...
4332,2017-10-28 19:10:37,Twokinds,"Like last night, SOMEONE in our party got caught stealing from someone's upstairs area, and suddenly we're fighting a shop full of puppets"
4425,2017-10-28 19:21:41,Twokinds,I need to start tanking better. People ignore my character because I have so much health and armor.

4495,2017-10-28 19:27:05,Twokinds,It really adds to the charm of the game.
4500,2017-10-28 19:27:17,Twokinds,All the voice actors are surprisingly good.

760,2017-11-10 14:16:42,Twokinds,I'm always better
773,2017-11-10 14:55:37,Twokinds,Yeah
774,2017-11-10 14:56:06,Twokinds,I'd say the biggest issue I have with it is that you retconned that Maddie isn't Adelaide's biological daughter
779,2017-11-10 15:02:04,Twokinds,I guess but a good lie is surrounded by a lot of truth
781,2017-11-10 15:02:27,Twokinds,"And having so much of it be potentially fabricated, especially her biological relationship with he rmother"
782,2017-11-10 15:03:02,Twokinds,It'd just end up being a huge contradiction
783,2017-11-10 15:03:50,Twokinds,A major part of Mad's character is that she's a disappointment. She didn't live up to her mother's legend. She's small.
787,2017-11-10 15:07:36,Twokinds,I'm not saying she is. That's just how a lot of Basitins see her.
790,2017-11-10 15:08:09,Twokinds,They wanted another Adelaide.
791,2017-11-10 15:08:16,Twokinds,...
794,2017-11-10 15:09:29,Twokinds,"Maddie doesn't allow it to show, but it causes a lot of angst and inspired her to be as different as possible."
795,2017-11-10 15:09:44,Twokinds,"Beacuse early on, everyone was sure she'd grow."
796,2017-11-10 15:09:52,Twokinds,A lot of pressure.
799,2017-11-10 15:10:50,Twokinds,Yeah it's a big reason. She wanted to leave her mother's shadow.
801,2017-11-10 15:12:01,Twokinds,"As you might have been able to tell, a lot of Basitin higher ups... are dicks."
804,2017-11-10 15:13:10,Twokinds,That might be fine. All the rest is good.

816,2017-11-10 15:27:13,Twokinds,It's also indirectly his fault Keith got his eye scar
818,2017-11-10 15:27:34,Twokinds,"...Man, Basitins have a thing for eye scars."
819,2017-11-10 15:27:57,Twokinds,"I think back then, I just really wanted to show that Basitins fight a lot. And that just translated to... lots of eye scars."

17,2017-11-12 01:13:51,Twokinds,The old files unfortunately for a long time were 200dpi.
18,2017-11-12 01:13:59,Twokinds,So I have a lot of work.
20,2017-11-12 01:14:48,Twokinds,I don't know what you mean.
21,2017-11-12 01:15:03,Twokinds,Yes?
23,2017-11-12 01:15:46,Twokinds,It's my files.
24,2017-11-12 01:15:50,Twokinds,My original photoshop files.
29,2017-11-12 01:23:28,Twokinds,I am on Page Natani-gets-thrown-into-a-wall
30,2017-11-12 01:23:47,Twokinds,"And yes, I do know about waifu2x, but that is not how I am upscaling."
33,2017-11-12 01:25:12,Twokinds,"Since I have layers, it is more effective for me to upscale them and then modify the linart seperately."
35,2017-11-12 01:27:49,Twokinds,"Did you know that in one version of the script, he did not blow up?"
36,2017-11-12 01:28:14,Twokinds,He actually becomes so flustered that he steps backwards and falls down the bridge cliff.
44,2017-11-12 01:29:30,Twokinds,"He doesn't. He just is presumed dead, and after the chapter is over there's a page of him climbing out of the canyon."
46,2017-11-12 01:30:05,Twokinds,"""I'm not dead!"""
47,2017-11-12 01:30:37,Twokinds,"But yeah, defeat by nudity was a little too silly"
48,2017-11-12 01:30:47,Twokinds,Although it would be funny
53,2017-11-12 01:32:24,Twokinds,"Well no, he's only come out of the canyon after they sailed away."
54,2017-11-12 01:32:31,Twokinds,Like a comically long time later.
55,2017-11-12 01:32:43,Twokinds,Just took so long to climb back up.

80,2017-11-12 02:50:04,Twokinds,I think all talked about was how the Musclehead General was once gunna fall to his doom rather than explode.

20,2017-11-14 17:25:07,Twokinds,I'm pretty sure I have a few times
22,2017-11-14 17:30:30,Twokinds,I once had a stream where there was a chapter early on during the Trace Flora Keith travel days where they're climbing a mountain.
24,2017-11-14 17:31:11,Twokinds,"When I woke up, I was determined to go find it, before quickly remembering that it never happened."
27,2017-11-14 17:32:02,Twokinds,"For a minute, I was certain it actually happened somewhere around chapter 3 or 4 and I somehow just forgot to post the entire chapter."
50,2017-11-14 18:00:08,Twokinds,Stream in 3 hours
51,2017-11-14 18:00:12,Twokinds,This is a warning to myself
55,2017-11-14 18:12:33,Twokinds,I've been feeling tired the last two days so I haven't been particularly productive
142,2017-11-14 20:08:03,Twokinds,"Yes, there will be a stream in 3 hours"
248,2017-11-14 20:59:25,Twokinds,I'm gunna be a little late
251,2017-11-14 20:59:35,Twokinds,This page is hard to draw

955,2017-11-14 22:35:38,Twokinds,It's very difficult to draw a dragon at the best of times. Much less... uh... going through some unique dragon-y acrobatics
976,2017-11-14 22:37:48,Twokinds,A roll or flip is not... unaccurate
1085,2017-11-14 22:51:41,Twokinds,Sorrry guys!
1091,2017-11-14 22:51:56,Twokinds,"This is giving me way more trouble than I thought it would. I'm gunna just call it and say, stream tomorrow."
1098,2017-11-14 22:52:11,Twokinds,I don't wanna try and rush out something I'm not happy with.
1108,2017-11-14 22:52:31,Twokinds,Probably a little earlier
1110,2017-11-14 22:52:38,Twokinds,But it depends. I'll aim for 6pm or so
1111,2017-11-14 22:52:39,Twokinds,est

1329,2017-11-14 23:09:41,Twokinds,I don't use it.
1331,2017-11-14 23:10:16,Twokinds,My characters have pretty large heads. A lot of cartoony art does.
1336,2017-11-14 23:11:26,Twokinds,"Uh, nothing really."
1338,2017-11-14 23:11:54,Twokinds,It's not like that
1340,2017-11-14 23:12:25,Twokinds,I don't think there's any artist out there that actually measures out the heads of their characters every time they draw them.
1342,2017-11-14 23:12:46,Twokinds,It's just about creating a model and then keeping everything consistant.
1343,2017-11-14 23:13:22,Twokinds,But head size varies from character to character.
1353,2017-11-14 23:16:22,Twokinds,Hate to say it but it really is just practice
1356,2017-11-14 23:17:38,Twokinds,"I'm not the fastest learner out there. I'm not like, naturally gifted. It just took years. I think it took more than a decade before Twokinds art got to a point I was happy with."
1369,2017-11-14 23:19:15,Twokinds,Sorry!
1370,2017-11-14 23:19:16,Twokinds,Tomorrow

1963,2017-11-15 23:26:00,Twokinds,Because it's a long process of redoing over and over. I've been working this page for two days.
1964,2017-11-15 23:26:03,Twokinds,It'd be a long stream.

2553,2017-11-17 15:20:37,Twokinds,I get stomach issues often because I eat very spicy food all the time.
2554,2017-11-17 15:20:48,Twokinds,If I stop it goes away.

2337,2017-11-18 18:21:17,Twokinds,I'm having a lot of trouble today. Yesterday's double update is causing a lot of instability. I don't think I'll be able to keep this up at this rate.
2345,2017-11-18 18:21:39,Twokinds,"Yes, obviously"
2821,2017-11-18 18:58:01,Twokinds,"I apologize for this, but would you guys mind if we resumed this on Monday?"
2828,2017-11-18 18:58:15,Twokinds,"I don't want to, but I'm not happy with the quality of my work at the moment."
2836,2017-11-18 18:58:23,Twokinds,"I'm hoping if I rest my hand for a day, it'll be better."
2845,2017-11-18 18:58:47,Twokinds,"I don't like delaying, but I don't want to give people sketches I'm not satisfied with."
2855,2017-11-18 18:59:07,Twokinds,"The double update from yesterday and the day before just destroyed my hand, apparently."
2864,2017-11-18 18:59:32,Twokinds,I'm gunna put it on ice

80,2017-11-19 15:10:49,Twokinds,"I think it's a little better than yesterday, but it's hard to tell."
86,2017-11-19 15:11:55,Twokinds,I might try some sketching off camera and see how it goes
100,2017-11-19 15:30:36,Twokinds,But art's all I do

745,2017-11-19 19:16:01,Twokinds,They also match what they look like later in the comic
749,2017-11-19 19:18:30,Twokinds,"Yeah, just expanding the background."
750,2017-11-19 19:18:59,Twokinds,"I didn't used full-bleeds very often in the old days, but whereever I did, I have to extend it so it goes to the edge of the paper."
751,2017-11-19 19:19:21,Twokinds,"Though it's a lot of work, most people probably wont even notice."
755,2017-11-19 19:20:59,Twokinds,Yeah that too
756,2017-11-19 19:21:05,Twokinds,https://i.imgur.com/TRcwUfw.jpg
757,2017-11-19 19:21:48,Twokinds,"Here's an example. Almost unnoticable, but all the edges are expanded, which means they're drawing in from scratch."
763,2017-11-19 19:23:24,Twokinds,"I could just expand, but it would both decrease the quality, and people would end up cut off."
764,2017-11-19 19:23:35,Twokinds,because the edges get chopped off. It's called the bleed area.
765,2017-11-19 19:23:48,Twokinds,It's a buffer zone. So blowing up artwork means the edges get cut.
766,2017-11-19 19:23:58,Twokinds,"But if you don't, you might end up with white edges."
767,2017-11-19 19:24:05,Twokinds,Which looks bad.
773,2017-11-19 19:30:15,Twokinds,Still a lot of work to do
774,2017-11-19 19:30:36,Twokinds,"I have to proofread everything, and some of the pages are getting rearranged so it reads better"

101,2017-11-20 15:31:22,Twokinds,"So this shows the outside of the tavern and Trace being dragged away by Basitins, then goes into Keith and Natani's room."

108,2017-11-20 15:36:40,Twokinds,Why not.
109,2017-11-20 15:37:16,Twokinds,I already do it for the chapter titles. xD It'll be like the art progresses back to how it was before as the page progresses. Like an old video game going from fmv to gameplay.

511,2017-11-22 18:49:54,Twokinds,I didn't even have turkey anyway XD
512,2017-11-22 18:50:35,Twokinds,I had biscuts and gravy.  Which I hear is also a mostly American thing.
537,2017-11-22 18:59:59,Twokinds,Uh... buscuts are not cookies
538,2017-11-22 19:00:11,Twokinds,Buscuits are like... bread.
547,2017-11-22 19:02:25,Twokinds,And they gravy isn't like the stuff you put on mashed potatoes.
548,2017-11-22 19:02:29,Twokinds,So it's hard to explain...
550,2017-11-22 19:02:47,Twokinds,It's a different kind of gravy.

1185,2017-12-01 03:06:10,Twokinds,I'm trying to come up with a way to create a gallery for the Patreon
1188,2017-12-01 03:06:45,Twokinds,So people can see thumbnails of all the sketches without having to scroll down down down.
1189,2017-12-01 03:06:58,Twokinds,But that's gunna be a lot of work with almost 300 links.
1192,2017-12-01 03:07:12,Twokinds,No but I could make one myself.

1378,2017-12-01 17:08:43,Twokinds,I mean at the beginning of the month I do all my color work stuff. All the Nora Cards and Color Vote.
1379,2017-12-01 17:10:06,Twokinds,Always a busy time.
1386,2017-12-01 17:12:58,Twokinds,I wish Wacom tablets just worked.
1387,2017-12-01 17:13:10,Twokinds,This 27QHD has given me nothing but headaches.
1392,2017-12-01 17:14:21,Twokinds,"The tablet randomly stops working when you turn it on. The drivers crash Photoshop randomly every few days. The pen jitters randomly, and requires me to change windows to stop it."
1393,2017-12-01 17:14:52,Twokinds,It's a lot more frustrating than my old tablet. I wish I had my 24 back.
1400,2017-12-01 17:16:58,Twokinds,The Wacom expresskeys (wireless remote because the 27QHD doesn't have built-in controls) is AWFUL.
1403,2017-12-01 17:17:28,Twokinds,"It's laggy and more inaccurate than built-in controls, and I feel like I'm turning it back on more often than using it."

1455,2017-12-02 16:59:51,Twokinds,Technically the pens are just backups in case one breaks. But I found they could be programmed differently
1457,2017-12-02 16:59:54,Twokinds,So I take advantage of that
1462,2017-12-02 17:00:08,Twokinds,Could just change the settings but it's easier just to switch pens
1477,2017-12-02 17:01:42,Twokinds,"The pens have different grip textures, so I can tell which one they are by feel."
1880,2017-12-02 17:36:22,Twokinds,AHOY!

5821,2017-12-02 22:39:55,Twokinds,Photoshop refused to open even after a restart. I have to turn off Wacom drivers manually before I could open it.
5831,2017-12-02 22:40:16,Twokinds,Wacom drivers are causing Photoshop to crash.
5842,2017-12-02 22:40:41,Twokinds,"It's okay now, but now I'm concerned"
5844,2017-12-02 22:40:49,Twokinds,I'm going to have to reinstall them again.
5846,2017-12-02 22:40:50,Twokinds,Later
5881,2017-12-02 22:43:13,Twokinds,OBS won't open
5975,2017-12-02 22:48:26,Twokinds,ugh reinstalling obs
6102,2017-12-02 23:00:21,Twokinds,Okay I had to completely reinstall OBS which means all my settings need to be redone
6145,2017-12-02 23:03:05,Twokinds,That's gunna be it for streaming tonight
6174,2017-12-02 23:04:45,Twokinds,I don't know

6192,2017-12-02 23:05:28,Twokinds,It's all gone

6347,2017-12-02 23:26:46,Twokinds,I'm having to compare the recording so I can try and remake the stream
6355,2017-12-02 23:27:10,Twokinds,The way the stream looks. Where all the windows and text is placed.
6367,2017-12-02 23:29:34,Twokinds,I couldn't
6368,2017-12-02 23:29:47,Twokinds,The settings were saved but I couldn't open the program without deleting everything
6374,2017-12-02 23:30:54,Twokinds,I never backed them up seomwhere else because I never considered that a program would just refuse to open.
6378,2017-12-02 23:31:11,Twokinds,"Like, that's not a possibility I considered."
74,2017-12-03 00:32:25,Twokinds,Okay
75,2017-12-03 00:32:32,Twokinds,Everything is just about back together.

117,2017-12-03 00:39:00,Twokinds,Is it working?
122,2017-12-03 00:39:11,Twokinds,I changed the color and quality settings.

154,2017-12-03 00:41:41,Twokinds,It'll make recordings bigger for sure
197,2017-12-03 00:44:37,Twokinds,This is pretty interesting. It's doing window capture rather than screen capture.
198,2017-12-03 00:44:54,Twokinds,It's something I never managed to get working before.
201,2017-12-03 00:45:10,Twokinds,It's better
206,2017-12-03 00:45:18,Twokinds,Hopefully it'll work the next time I turn it on.
217,2017-12-03 00:46:21,Twokinds,Goodbye!
246,2017-12-03 00:47:51,Twokinds,That was just a test
259,2017-12-03 00:48:16,Twokinds,Sorry to anyone who got an email
272,2017-12-03 00:50:19,Twokinds,"I don't know how photoshop window capture is working, but I'm glad."
278,2017-12-03 00:51:49,Twokinds,"before, the way photoshop would work meant you couldn't see windows in photoshop, including canvases."
280,2017-12-03 00:52:07,Twokinds,So the only thing you could do is capture the whole screen and just crop it.
285,2017-12-03 00:53:04,Twokinds,Yeah. You'd just see the grey background of photoshop when nothing's open
290,2017-12-03 00:53:48,Twokinds,"That's why sometimes when I accidentally minimize photoshop, you'd see the desktop."
293,2017-12-03 00:54:11,Twokinds,"But now, it's specifically always displaying just the Photoshop window."
301,2017-12-03 00:54:54,Twokinds,"So now I can, for example, move the obs tool onto my tablet screen, and not have that blackhole effect"
306,2017-12-03 00:55:38,Twokinds,Yeah

100,2017-12-12 16:41:49,Twokinds,"No, I don't live in my childhood home."
110,2017-12-12 16:47:34,Twokinds,We didn't have a lot of money growing up around that time. Our family eventually lost the home I grew up in and moved to a townhouse when I was around 12.

142,2017-12-12 16:52:19,Twokinds,We didn't have a lot. I have a picture of us from a very pathetic Christmas around a not-even-pine-tree. But I have strange nostalgia around those days.
148,2017-12-12 16:53:21,Twokinds,I think it was just a fake tree we had in our house anyway.
150,2017-12-12 16:53:42,Twokinds,"But yeah, my dad did everything he could to make sure we still lived well dispite it."
153,2017-12-12 16:54:29,Twokinds,I know now it must have stressed him out a lot.

668,2017-12-12 19:52:58,Twokinds,It is due to lack of sunlight.
669,2017-12-12 19:53:07,Twokinds,I have been considering getting a mobile drawing tablet.
670,2017-12-12 19:53:17,Twokinds,But I don't like what's currently on the market right now.
