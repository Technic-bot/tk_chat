835,2022-01-01 17:48:12,Twokinds,It means hill. Restful hill.
836,2022-01-01 17:48:18,Twokinds,Saria of Boring Hill.
862,2022-01-01 17:51:57,Twokinds,That's pretty much how people really were named
871,2022-01-01 17:53:33,Twokinds,Yeah
875,2022-01-01 17:53:52,Twokinds,It's like... Fishing Brook.
879,2022-01-01 17:54:21,Twokinds,So the original Fischbachs were presumably fishermen. Or people who lived near a place were they fished.
898,2022-01-01 17:56:05,Twokinds,old human
909,2022-01-01 17:57:02,Twokinds,Same old human that came up with the word Keidran. Which means beast people.
911,2022-01-01 17:57:26,Twokinds,"And Keiren, which means beast killer, or just Hunter."
918,2022-01-01 17:58:39,Twokinds,It's just the old version of what humans speak now in the comic
920,2022-01-01 17:58:43,Twokinds,It's a made-up language.
925,2022-01-01 17:59:16,Twokinds,No
926,2022-01-01 17:59:20,Twokinds,Not a real language

1030,2022-01-01 18:07:31,Twokinds,Yeah
1031,2022-01-01 18:07:45,Twokinds,Because her family are blacksmiths 
1076,2022-01-01 18:13:46,Twokinds,Uh... I can't do the math...
1081,2022-01-01 18:13:58,Twokinds,Yeah she was much older than Trace when they married.
1082,2022-01-01 18:14:20,Twokinds,It was a point of contention
1107,2022-01-01 18:16:01,Twokinds,No
1114,2022-01-01 18:16:37,Twokinds,She's was apprehensive about dating someone so young.
1136,2022-01-01 18:20:03,Twokinds,It doesn't mean Keidran hunter
1138,2022-01-01 18:20:06,Twokinds,It just mean hunter
1139,2022-01-01 18:20:11,Twokinds,Like... guys who are named hunter.
1147,2022-01-01 18:20:57,Twokinds,Kei means animal.
1153,2022-01-01 18:21:32,Twokinds,Yeah
1170,2022-01-01 18:23:38,Twokinds,"Not an unusual thing for a long time in human history, sadly."
1214,2022-01-01 18:29:05,Twokinds,"I gave up soda for New Years exactly 10 years ago, in 2012."

2372,2022-01-01 20:45:40,Twokinds,oh yeah
2373,2022-01-01 20:45:45,Twokinds,I'll probably clean it up
2410,2022-01-01 20:50:44,Twokinds,"Well, the strongest Basitins are almost entirely immune to magic, so I'm not sure it'd be that big of an advantage."
2411,2022-01-01 20:51:02,Twokinds,So I guess it depends on how powerful she is
2417,2022-01-01 20:52:29,Twokinds,"It's possible. Jane's not invincible, for sure."
2418,2022-01-01 20:52:44,Twokinds,"She's getting up there in age, but it'd be a challenge for sure."
2436,2022-01-01 20:53:57,Twokinds,"Being a human, you'd be without the Basitin's supernatural strength."
2651,2022-01-01 21:23:18,Twokinds,Done
2671,2022-01-01 21:25:34,Twokinds,"She was like family to Keith, before his banishment. Keith knew she was off the mainland, and thought dead, but he figured finding her was his best bet, if he ended up banished forever."
2672,2022-01-01 21:25:42,Twokinds,So he thought about her often.
2687,2022-01-01 21:27:12,Twokinds,Yeah probably
2690,2022-01-01 21:27:54,Twokinds,"The next one, I actually am already done with!"

2769,2022-01-01 21:30:36,Twokinds,I drew this over the holidays because I liked the idea
2783,2022-01-01 21:31:39,Twokinds,I'm glad it was suggested again. I had a fear it wouldn't be and then that would have been awkward.
2848,2022-01-01 21:39:34,Twokinds,7 isn't it?

3062,2022-01-01 21:52:48,Twokinds,I imagine it was pretty mundane.
3088,2022-01-01 21:55:22,Twokinds,"There's not a lot, but there are some travelers."
3094,2022-01-01 21:56:22,Twokinds,Sometimes people just crash on the island and need time to leave.
3261,2022-01-01 22:24:39,Twokinds,Classic old style
3264,2022-01-01 22:25:03,Twokinds,"Friendly, casual, for the stylish retro Basitin"
3298,2022-01-01 22:28:03,Twokinds,Done
3356,2022-01-01 22:31:47,Twokinds,"Probably not much to say about Saria, since her whole story's pretty much been told at this point."
3372,2022-01-01 22:32:55,Twokinds,"Saria loved to say ""boy I need this like I need a poisoned arrow to the shoulder"". Her favorite phrase would soon turn tragically ironic."

388,2022-01-07 00:57:36,Twokinds,What do you think?
407,2022-01-07 00:59:33,Twokinds,Yeah he's just fox but... all neck
413,2022-01-07 01:01:09,Twokinds,I wanted a distinctive silhouette.
440,2022-01-07 01:04:46,Twokinds,"Whoops, there goes the neighborhood! (laugh track)"
460,2022-01-07 01:06:57,Twokinds,It's too dangerous to be removed
462,2022-01-07 01:07:07,Twokinds,It contains his power
592,2022-01-07 01:27:42,Twokinds,"I'm done for tonight. I've got other things to work on, but due to future comic spoilers, I can't stream it."
593,2022-01-07 01:27:47,Twokinds,"So, tata for now!"
672,2022-01-07 02:06:11,Twokinds,"Somehow, those two things sound like they fit together."
699,2022-01-07 03:22:39,Twokinds,Special brushes?
701,2022-01-07 03:25:48,Twokinds,XD
702,2022-01-07 03:25:52,Twokinds,Waaat
705,2022-01-07 03:26:55,Twokinds,That's silly
711,2022-01-07 03:29:12,Twokinds,But how good could a fried chicken brush really be?
716,2022-01-07 03:32:05,Twokinds,lol
717,2022-01-07 03:32:11,Twokinds,Wow meat
734,2022-01-07 03:36:31,Twokinds,The art of hand painting food is half the fun.
738,2022-01-07 04:25:12,Twokinds,Which one?
740,2022-01-07 04:29:07,Twokinds,Sounds intense
748,2022-01-07 04:37:13,Twokinds,"Oh yeah, this is sounding familiar."
749,2022-01-07 04:37:26,Twokinds,I think you mentioned this one before. Sounds interesting!

478,2022-01-08 17:21:11,Twokinds,I've had to drive like that once. It's scary stuff.
483,2022-01-08 17:21:50,Twokinds,Literally poking my arm with a pencil to stay attentive on my way home.
493,2022-01-08 17:22:54,Twokinds,lol yeah

1161,2022-01-08 18:17:33,Twokinds,Someone already tried that.

2295,2022-01-08 20:14:19,Twokinds,"Raine, eh?"
2301,2022-01-08 20:14:38,Twokinds,Honestly I just picked E because it made her name sound like Rainy
2333,2022-01-08 20:17:13,Twokinds,"They're just different stylistic ways to representing it. Like, serif and san serif type faces."
2343,2022-01-08 20:17:35,Twokinds,Also Keith's symbol is often drawn reversed from the standard version.
2353,2022-01-08 20:18:22,Twokinds,"I mean, maybe it could be that too. I haven't really given it enough thought to go into detail."
2356,2022-01-08 20:18:41,Twokinds,"I'm not much of a... symbol artist? I don't know what that's called, but it's a specialization I'm no good with."

2415,2022-01-08 20:24:04,Twokinds,btw next week we'll be doing an Omnipoll on the Patreon
2416,2022-01-08 20:24:12,Twokinds,To determine next Sunday's sketches.
2425,2022-01-08 20:24:43,Twokinds,I think I've decided that a good way to do it is to run an omnipoll on every month where there's an extra week of sketches.
2721,2022-01-08 21:12:12,Twokinds,Done
3053,2022-01-08 21:40:47,Twokinds,She's running to go fight some old basitin guy shooting lightning

172,2022-01-09 00:14:30,Twokinds,I don't remember him ever being a horse...

447,2022-01-13 21:40:45,Twokinds,There's some people I'm waiting on to get back to me about their suggestion

497,2022-01-13 21:52:15,Twokinds,2012 doesn't feel that long ago when I look at some of the games I was playing.
499,2022-01-13 21:52:24,Twokinds,But then other games make me feel old.
501,2022-01-13 21:52:49,Twokinds,Oh did you not see Flora's color yet?
510,2022-01-13 21:53:48,Twokinds,I showed it to Ron

595,2022-01-15 17:08:42,Twokinds,I just took an extended break during the holidays.
598,2022-01-15 17:08:52,Twokinds,I really needed it.
603,2022-01-15 17:09:09,Twokinds,I wanted to work on some personal artwork.
621,2022-01-15 17:10:38,Twokinds,"I apologize anyway, I will be more upfront with my schedule this year, once I get my feet under myself again."

775,2022-01-15 17:22:17,Twokinds,"I mostly studied on my own, by looking at other people's art and practicing to try and replicate it."
782,2022-01-15 17:22:37,Twokinds,"That's not to say I don't have art books, they are nice."
804,2022-01-15 17:24:05,Twokinds,I understand the frustration of trying to learn art well.
805,2022-01-15 17:24:22,Twokinds,I'm getting started on 3D and it feels like starting from square one again.
827,2022-01-15 17:26:12,Twokinds,I'm definitely not making 3d models of all the characters haha
831,2022-01-15 17:26:25,Twokinds,But you might expect a 3d Nibbs in the future
843,2022-01-15 17:26:50,Twokinds,Seems like an easy first real project
848,2022-01-15 17:27:18,Twokinds,Because she's a small simple character to start out on?
854,2022-01-15 17:27:51,Twokinds,"She's got no hair, has a basic body with one color that's pretty small and simple."
857,2022-01-15 17:28:08,Twokinds,Sure

1283,2022-01-15 18:06:58,Twokinds,"Uh, 99 is really good."
1312,2022-01-15 18:08:43,Twokinds,lol yeah sorry about that. Obscure references will tend to do that.

2417,2022-01-15 19:37:20,Twokinds,As long as it's not a human run streaming service she might be ok
2431,2022-01-15 19:38:47,Twokinds,"In the modern day Twokinds setting, being ""in the fur"" is less practiced, but still technically legal. It's actual a big point of contention in the setting, as many humans wish for it to be made illegal, ever since the two races began cohabitating more."
2481,2022-01-15 19:43:35,Twokinds,"Some humans argue against it on moral grounds, because they don't want kids exposed to that kind of thing. But others argue it's an equality issue. Since humans can't, they claim it's unequal treatment under the law, which is against their rights."
2482,2022-01-15 19:43:48,Twokinds,So it's one of the big conflicts of the modern setting.
2490,2022-01-15 19:44:15,Twokinds,The Keidran see it as yet another attempt by humans to destroy their culture for the sake of human sensibilities.
2672,2022-01-15 20:09:34,Twokinds,I remember feeling extremely ripped off when I payed $700 for my 2080
2678,2022-01-15 20:10:28,Twokinds,Just in time
2835,2022-01-15 20:23:32,Twokinds,The only people who die are those that can't afford not to.

3701,2022-01-15 22:06:38,Twokinds,red vs blue
3822,2022-01-15 22:21:33,Twokinds,Then he'd make some dumb joke and she'd quickly change her mind
4109,2022-01-15 23:01:40,Twokinds,emotion-driven magic

4339,2022-01-15 23:18:21,Twokinds,fake cat
4363,2022-01-15 23:20:13,Twokinds,I'm gunna go make a sandwich
4370,2022-01-15 23:20:20,Twokinds,Then I'll do the rest of the sketches
4381,2022-01-15 23:20:47,Twokinds,[Intermission]
4528,2022-01-15 23:31:51,Twokinds,I just realized it's snowing outside
4544,2022-01-15 23:32:41,Twokinds,There's an inch or two on the ground
4559,2022-01-15 23:33:31,Twokinds,I love snow
4565,2022-01-15 23:33:42,Twokinds,"I never have to go outside, so it never bothers me."
4587,2022-01-15 23:34:50,Twokinds,"Yeah, they're dancing lights, just magic decoration."
4597,2022-01-15 23:35:21,Twokinds,"That said, they are based on actual living Wisps or Dancing Lights."
4605,2022-01-15 23:36:02,Twokinds,"Not to be confused with Will o the Wisps, just plane wisps are mostly harmless things that float around. They're like jellyfish."
4607,2022-01-15 23:36:10,Twokinds,Except ethereal.
4609,2022-01-15 23:36:16,Twokinds,They have no minds.
4623,2022-01-15 23:36:59,Twokinds,"They gather around strong emotion and absorb it. If one passes through someone, though, they'll get all the emotion it was storing up, which can be bad or dangerous."
4624,2022-01-15 23:37:01,Twokinds,Or good.
4637,2022-01-15 23:37:49,Twokinds,"It's why fake dancing lights became a thing, because the living wisps often gathered during parties."
4644,2022-01-15 23:38:29,Twokinds,I don't see why they wouldn't be.
4647,2022-01-15 23:38:40,Twokinds,lol
4651,2022-01-15 23:38:45,Twokinds,They're just made of harmless magic
4656,2022-01-15 23:39:06,Twokinds,Some people keep them as pets in jars.
4665,2022-01-15 23:39:28,Twokinds,"Usually the negative ones, actually."
4670,2022-01-15 23:39:56,Twokinds,The negative ones feed off things like fear or anger.
4675,2022-01-15 23:40:09,Twokinds,So they'll take away some of your fear or anger. You wouldn't want a happy one.
4676,2022-01-15 23:40:12,Twokinds,Because... I mean...
4679,2022-01-15 23:40:18,Twokinds,You don't want it to eat your happiness.
4685,2022-01-15 23:40:39,Twokinds,They're not related to pixies at all
4688,2022-01-15 23:40:49,Twokinds,Pixies are actual physical creatures.
4691,2022-01-15 23:40:56,Twokinds,These are just magic balls of light and emotion.
4692,2022-01-15 23:41:18,Twokinds,"Well, not the ones in this picture, they're just fakes."
4700,2022-01-15 23:41:56,Twokinds,"I'm not sure if slimes are actually canon or not, I haven't put any thought into that."
4717,2022-01-15 23:42:54,Twokinds,I've considered the wisps a lot.
4812,2022-01-15 23:48:52,Twokinds,This was a study.
4815,2022-01-15 23:49:13,Twokinds,Just for practice
4825,2022-01-15 23:49:38,Twokinds,The other one's from 2006
4834,2022-01-15 23:50:05,Twokinds,It was my first real attempt at digital painting
4835,2022-01-15 23:50:18,Twokinds,"Yeah, 16 years. I'm a slow learner."
4868,2022-01-15 23:51:52,Twokinds,"The left I painted about a year ago, then I repainted it now."
4893,2022-01-15 23:53:02,Twokinds,I didn't keep track of how long I took on either of them
4896,2022-01-15 23:53:16,Twokinds,And obviously the second one I already had the first as a base to work off of.
4899,2022-01-15 23:53:46,Twokinds,Random wolf shepherd.
4922,2022-01-15 23:54:39,Twokinds,shading is so difficult

5005,2022-01-15 23:59:19,Twokinds,When I have more time
9,2022-01-16 00:00:46,Twokinds,"It's fine. The next page is one it's way, I just need a bit more time."

442,2022-01-16 00:35:03,Twokinds,Must have gotten mixed up with hers when the showered before the show.
454,2022-01-16 00:35:53,Twokinds,Yes. It's eco friendly that way.
629,2022-01-16 01:00:59,Twokinds,Done
642,2022-01-16 01:01:29,Twokinds,Revenge for that assistant outfit last time.
