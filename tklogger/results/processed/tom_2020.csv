394,2020-01-02 21:22:29,Twokinds,There are ghosts though
398,2020-01-02 21:22:53,Twokinds,Clearly not
744,2020-01-02 21:55:59,Twokinds,brb
833,2020-01-02 22:10:57,Twokinds,This guy is the same guy from http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/1006/
834,2020-01-02 22:11:05,Twokinds,Beardy McFakeTemplar
848,2020-01-02 22:12:47,Twokinds,The real Templar already know Trace's estate can't be entered without permission.
850,2020-01-02 22:13:07,Twokinds,That's why The Master Seer Braun never tried to occupy it while Trace was gone.
910,2020-01-02 22:20:28,Twokinds,Boredom
967,2020-01-02 22:26:08,Twokinds,This is also the guy who threw a fireball at Maeve
996,2020-01-02 22:26:59,Twokinds,"Nope. Clovis was in the middle. Brutus was on the left, he was on the right."
1000,2020-01-02 22:27:09,Twokinds,Left from Clovis' perspective.
1004,2020-01-02 22:27:28,Twokinds,And the right one threw the fireball.
1020,2020-01-02 22:29:45,Twokinds,Just some other lacky named Sam
1038,2020-01-02 22:31:59,Twokinds,I get it.
1062,2020-01-02 22:34:43,Twokinds,He died in chicken form.
1072,2020-01-02 22:35:38,Twokinds,"Uh, no"
1083,2020-01-02 22:36:54,Twokinds,This is Roan
1085,2020-01-02 22:36:57,Twokinds,Sam is the cow.
1112,2020-01-02 22:39:49,Twokinds,"Other than the Keidran meat, no."
1132,2020-01-02 22:41:42,Twokinds,"He loved Keidran. Keidran steaks, Keidran burgers, Keidran kabobs..."
1169,2020-01-02 22:44:44,Twokinds,"The kitchens of the manner used to just make food all day long, constantly."
1171,2020-01-02 22:44:47,Twokinds,There was a lot of staff.
1175,2020-01-02 22:45:13,Twokinds,"He employed over 100 people in the building alone, and more in the surrounding area, like the fields."
1179,2020-01-02 22:45:29,Twokinds,The food was placed in storage. Suspended animation.
1180,2020-01-02 22:45:40,Twokinds,"It can then be called upon, and it's just like it was made moments ago."

1205,2020-01-02 22:46:52,Twokinds,"Trace got more and more paranoid, and his staff became smaller and smaller."
1209,2020-01-02 22:47:03,Twokinds,Until it was just Rose and a handful of others.
1473,2020-01-02 23:15:55,Twokinds,XD
1494,2020-01-02 23:18:07,Twokinds,Yes

504,2020-01-03 01:32:11,Twokinds,Writing.
537,2020-01-03 01:34:37,Twokinds,"Anyway, I'm out!"
543,2020-01-03 01:34:44,Twokinds,Byyeeee
16,2020-01-04 14:08:38,Twokinds,I have a feeling today's stream is going to go terribly XD
17,2020-01-04 14:08:51,Twokinds,I got 2 hours of sleep last night. I'm the walking dead right now.
23,2020-01-04 14:17:04,Twokinds,I'm going to try taking a nap. If the stream doesn't start... uh... I didn't wake up.
918,2020-01-04 17:40:27,Twokinds,brb
996,2020-01-04 17:52:34,Twokinds,Yeah I've never used SAI
1019,2020-01-04 17:53:53,Twokinds,Hallo Lann
1051,2020-01-04 17:56:11,Twokinds,I have no memory of ever using SAI for any of my art. I'm almost certain.
1088,2020-01-04 18:02:34,Twokinds,Yeah just a way to make variety
1089,2020-01-04 18:02:44,Twokinds,Same reason some foxes have muzzles and some don't.
1094,2020-01-04 18:03:45,Twokinds,Yes
1126,2020-01-04 18:09:54,Twokinds,Done

1442,2020-01-04 19:05:47,Twokinds,I'm crashing real bad right now
1459,2020-01-04 19:08:54,Twokinds,I'm almost certainly going to have to.
1462,2020-01-04 19:09:04,Twokinds,I don't think I can draw well enough pretty soon
1555,2020-01-04 19:21:59,Twokinds,"Okay, I'm done."
1557,2020-01-04 19:22:02,Twokinds,I can't go on.
1579,2020-01-04 19:22:38,Twokinds,Hopefully I can get more than 2 hours of sleep

500,2020-01-09 22:25:05,Twokinds,"That's why the original title for this drawing was ""Flora and Slavegirl"""
502,2020-01-09 22:25:13,Twokinds,Cause she had no name.
511,2020-01-09 22:26:59,Twokinds,Well she's still a fairly side-ly character
527,2020-01-09 22:28:57,Twokinds,Honestly I think I had Kat tag along because I didn't have almost any female characters in the cast besides Flora at that point XD
535,2020-01-09 22:29:56,Twokinds,"Maren and Karen were out by then when they reached the docks. So besides Nora, who was a cat, that was it, I think."

518,2020-01-11 16:56:15,Twokinds,Dragons turn into lots of things that can't use magic.
546,2020-01-11 16:58:15,Twokinds,Really? No one mentioned the stream wasn't up
547,2020-01-11 16:58:17,Twokinds,until now
608,2020-01-11 17:04:25,Twokinds,I already said Dragons shapeshift innately. They're MADE of magic. It doesn't matter what form they're in. They take forms that can't use magic literally ALL the time.

1495,2020-01-11 19:27:24,Twokinds,No
1497,2020-01-11 19:27:27,Twokinds,That would be a spoiler
1773,2020-01-11 19:51:25,Twokinds,The mindscape is like a holodeck.

2059,2020-01-11 20:20:08,Twokinds,I don't think so.

2143,2020-01-11 20:26:06,Twokinds,I gotta run more often too.
2147,2020-01-11 20:26:28,Twokinds,Need the exercise.
2153,2020-01-11 20:26:39,Twokinds,Never.
2211,2020-01-11 20:31:35,Twokinds,"Oh yeah, I forgot to do a pick"
2233,2020-01-11 20:34:53,Twokinds,Man I can't decide
2373,2020-01-11 20:49:20,Twokinds,Not posted yet
2384,2020-01-11 20:53:31,Twokinds,Clovis doesn't get hit. He pays people to get hit for him.
2417,2020-01-11 20:57:36,Twokinds,"I've never been able to really draw Clovis and Natani standing full length, side by side, but he's actually pretty small."
2429,2020-01-11 21:00:04,Twokinds,I can't remember if I ever mentioned how tall he is exactly.
2440,2020-01-11 21:01:12,Twokinds,He's shorter than Trace
2465,2020-01-11 21:03:28,Twokinds,"Probably about 5' 6"" or so"
2479,2020-01-11 21:04:37,Twokinds,Yeah for a 'wolf' he looks extremely short by comparison
2483,2020-01-11 21:05:27,Twokinds,"A lot of people underestimated him early in his career because of it. But it never really bothered Clovis too much, since they... you know, ended up dead or serving him, one way or another."
2491,2020-01-11 21:06:22,Twokinds,Magic and money tends to even the playing field.
2495,2020-01-11 21:06:35,Twokinds,Height and physical prowess doesn't really matter.
2501,2020-01-11 21:07:19,Twokinds,"Clovis is good with magic. He's not great, but he does have talent."
2506,2020-01-11 21:07:42,Twokinds,It's his money that really puts him over the edge into extremely good.
2508,2020-01-11 21:07:54,Twokinds,Cause he buys enchantments that supplement his power.
2518,2020-01-11 21:08:44,Twokinds,"But yeah, a lot of people underestimate him thinking he's all money and no talent, but that's not true either. He's still good in his own right."
2525,2020-01-11 21:09:37,Twokinds,Possibly. But he's almost always surrounded by his hired muscle.
2577,2020-01-11 21:17:05,Twokinds,Clovis would never stab himself. There's no one he loves more.
2591,2020-01-11 21:20:20,Twokinds,Definitely not
2593,2020-01-11 21:20:26,Twokinds,Since Clovis isn't actual royalty
2600,2020-01-11 21:21:23,Twokinds,He likes to be called that

3619,2020-01-11 23:47:29,Twokinds,Yeah
3620,2020-01-11 23:47:32,Twokinds,I think so
3622,2020-01-11 23:47:39,Twokinds,Unless they decided to change it.
3624,2020-01-11 23:48:06,Twokinds,Pretty much
3651,2020-01-11 23:53:52,Twokinds,I'd have nothing to say about Nibbly.

3677,2020-01-11 23:56:28,Twokinds,Nibbly's going to outlive some of the Keidran.

470,2020-01-23 22:19:18,Twokinds,It's gunna happen. chill
529,2020-01-23 22:27:52,Twokinds,brb
560,2020-01-23 22:36:10,Twokinds,Thanks for stopping by
750,2020-01-23 23:02:57,Twokinds,Calm down
753,2020-01-23 23:03:09,Twokinds,"You'll see why this is all happening soon enough, and a lot of things will end up resolved."
876,2020-01-23 23:28:43,Twokinds,I am not feeling very well
962,2020-01-23 23:36:03,Twokinds,I need to quit for now

279,2020-01-24 15:36:51,Twokinds,The cough has largely subsided.
281,2020-01-24 15:37:03,Twokinds,Sore throat is improving
291,2020-01-24 15:43:10,Twokinds,I meant the prospects of them having sex
324,2020-01-24 15:59:43,Twokinds,It's not a romantic relationship.
325,2020-01-24 15:59:56,Twokinds,It's just casual.
394,2020-01-24 16:20:29,Twokinds,"The reasoning is not very deep. Maren is a distant person due to events in her past. She only wants a relationship when there's no strings attached. No love. Like with Trace. In a way, being a Keidran works for that."
395,2020-01-24 16:20:37,Twokinds,Especially since Sythe proposed it so casually.
398,2020-01-24 16:21:27,Twokinds,Yeh
402,2020-01-24 16:22:12,Twokinds,"I mean, she's clearly lying to herself about wanting no love, but it's her defense mechanism."
410,2020-01-24 16:25:27,Twokinds,Yeah totally
412,2020-01-24 16:26:46,Twokinds,Have PATIENCE

498,2020-01-24 16:47:14,Twokinds,Bye Sage
584,2020-01-24 17:02:07,Twokinds,I use a script to organize my layers

616,2020-01-24 17:05:06,Twokinds,It certainly makes the process simpler.
622,2020-01-24 17:05:29,Twokinds,Just had to do it once. Photoshop lets you record all your actions and replay them.
628,2020-01-24 17:05:56,Twokinds,Yeah they're macros
916,2020-01-24 17:47:48,Twokinds,iliar you're making some assumptions
917,2020-01-24 17:47:56,Twokinds,Please have patience
1039,2020-01-24 18:09:35,Twokinds,Thanks
1041,2020-01-24 18:09:48,Twokinds,I'm pretty excited for this next part of the story. I'm actually getting to reveal things that I had in mind since when I started the comic.
1396,2020-01-24 18:43:28,Twokinds,Initiate emergency forgotten birthday procedure. Teleporting in flowers.
1404,2020-01-24 18:44:17,Twokinds,"Trace, you have forgotten [6] years worth of birthdays."
1410,2020-01-24 18:44:50,Twokinds,Maren is crushed under flowers and chocolate. The end.
1439,2020-01-24 18:47:09,Twokinds,I think I'm done

191,2020-01-25 14:16:35,Twokinds,They spelled it the same wrong way three times
195,2020-01-25 14:16:53,Twokinds,It looks like Raine
197,2020-01-25 14:17:08,Twokinds,But the suggestion seems otherwise.
199,2020-01-25 14:17:14,Twokinds,"""Nora and Raini are resting in a rainforest, it starts raining and Nora wraps her wing around Raini."""
200,2020-01-25 14:17:22,Twokinds,This feels like Reni.
208,2020-01-25 14:18:11,Twokinds,Man I spend so much time fixing typos with these 100's of suggestions :ctwokinds-LauraCry:
306,2020-01-25 16:04:25,Twokinds,Welcome!

346,2020-01-25 16:07:33,Twokinds,Had to save my roomba from the bathroom lol
352,2020-01-25 16:07:43,Twokinds,I gotta set her up to not run on Sundays.
355,2020-01-25 16:07:54,Twokinds,"Yeah, it's scheduled to run at 4pm every day"
359,2020-01-25 16:08:08,Twokinds,"Not often, but the bathroom's kinda tricky."
362,2020-01-25 16:08:15,Twokinds,And it's distracting when I'm trying to work.
392,2020-01-25 16:09:21,Twokinds,Hi Heresy!

409,2020-01-25 16:10:16,Twokinds,Ready for the first vote?
456,2020-01-25 16:14:51,Twokinds,Put shadows where light gets blocked by something.
470,2020-01-25 16:15:31,Twokinds,Yeah it's way easier said than done.
474,2020-01-25 16:15:44,Twokinds,But that's basically it. Just learning how to think in 3d and imaging what's blocking what.
479,2020-01-25 16:16:14,Twokinds,Then it's largely technique. When to use soft and hard edges for shadows.
553,2020-01-25 16:21:23,Twokinds,Con was fun
625,2020-01-25 16:34:28,Twokinds,how do you spell hi5
626,2020-01-25 16:34:31,Twokinds,High five?
875,2020-01-25 17:01:52,Twokinds,"Old Trace was searching for candidates. People close enough, from backwater towns who wouldn't be missed."
880,2020-01-25 17:02:43,Twokinds,"Obviously, he didn't really think of Maren as a girlfriend. He tested tranformation on Karen, and planned to test more magic on Maren."
906,2020-01-25 17:06:06,Twokinds,Done
955,2020-01-25 17:12:54,Twokinds,Yeah
963,2020-01-25 17:14:09,Twokinds,As long as it's accidental it's fine.

2001,2020-01-25 19:10:27,Twokinds,I'll clean this up later. I'm done

2456,2020-01-25 19:51:34,Twokinds,Ignore that one. There was two of the same theme.

4202,2020-01-25 22:57:48,Twokinds,I think I have some ideas now
4210,2020-01-25 23:04:56,Twokinds,That gallery is really useful
4212,2020-01-25 23:05:39,Twokinds,I need to remember to put up a link to it on my patreon.
4213,2020-01-25 23:05:52,Twokinds,I actually use it a lot to look up sketches I've done in the past.
4216,2020-01-25 23:06:51,Twokinds,Oh that? I don't think I even ever posted that anywhere.
4218,2020-01-25 23:07:10,Twokinds,Patreon doesn't have tag cross referencing.
4219,2020-01-25 23:07:14,Twokinds,Which is a shame.
4220,2020-01-25 23:07:42,Twokinds,twokinds.gallery lets you search for multiple tags at once with the + signs.

7,2020-01-26 00:55:11,Twokinds,As for the king and thor's hammer...
8,2020-01-26 00:55:12,Twokinds,Uh...
9,2020-01-26 00:56:07,Twokinds,I'm not sure. Basitins have a few similarities to asgardians. But I don't know if she's really qualify as 'worthy'.
15,2020-01-26 01:00:56,Twokinds,True she is.
17,2020-01-26 01:01:11,Twokinds,I don't know enough about Marvel to know the specifics of what 'worthy' means.
18,2020-01-26 01:01:31,Twokinds,Could make a good suggestion.

102,2020-03-19 20:17:56,Twokinds,I've got a headache because I forgot to drink coffee this morning.
106,2020-03-19 20:18:28,Twokinds,"I did MAKE the coffee, but left it in the pot and got caught up with work. Forgot."
113,2020-03-19 20:21:07,Twokinds,Yeah I always get a headache after a few hours if I go off my routine.
122,2020-03-19 20:22:41,Twokinds,I do drink a lot of coffee. I should probably cut back.

225,2020-04-04 14:53:05,Twokinds,It's hard to find duplicates
226,2020-04-04 14:53:10,Twokinds,Because people use different wording
227,2020-04-04 14:53:17,Twokinds,"And some are similiar, but not similiar enough to be combined"

4703,2020-04-04 21:27:12,Twokinds,"Hm, I don't think the story would have changed at all if Alaric was a girl"
4725,2020-04-04 21:28:49,Twokinds,"Perhaps Alaric and Keith's fiendship wouldn't have been as possible, because they'd have been segregated."
4733,2020-04-04 21:29:23,Twokinds,But I'm sure they'd still have met at some point.
4760,2020-04-04 21:32:23,Twokinds,Keith running off to hang out with Alaric in secret would really make Alabaster mad.
4762,2020-04-04 21:32:34,Twokinds,Probably justify his thoughts of Keith being a bad egg.
4806,2020-04-04 21:38:46,Twokinds,"Same thing, except Evals would be stuck as a girl for a long time"
4820,2020-04-04 21:40:05,Twokinds,It was the kiss that changed Mike back
4827,2020-04-04 21:40:29,Twokinds,"But Mike would never have gotten into bed with Evals like he had, so Evals wouldn't get a kiss and he'd be stuck."

560,2020-04-09 08:35:20,Twokinds,It would be handy right about now. I'll have to look into it.

943,2020-04-10 18:24:03,Twokinds,if you could make the same thing happen with rock
952,2020-04-10 18:25:47,Twokinds,"No no, it's not the t1000"
954,2020-04-10 18:25:55,Twokinds,He's not actually liquid
963,2020-04-10 18:27:36,Twokinds,"Yeah, I know. It's magic, so it's an impossible thing, rock that moves fluidly without being liquid."

350,2020-04-11 14:52:35,Twokinds,The stream will be slightly late
351,2020-04-11 14:52:38,Twokinds,Probably 1 hor
353,2020-04-11 14:52:42,Twokinds,I'm finishing the comic now
356,2020-04-11 14:52:46,Twokinds,It'll be posted shortly
457,2020-04-11 15:06:35,Twokinds,The flashback is from before Saria's death.
458,2020-04-11 15:06:46,Twokinds,The hint is Trace not being crazy.
466,2020-04-11 15:07:30,Twokinds,Because it's her best friend's fiance.
468,2020-04-11 15:07:44,Twokinds,Sort of a social obligation to be nice to the new family of a good friend.
477,2020-04-11 15:09:23,Twokinds,"Trace is always wanting to make a big show for Saria. Nora cares for Trace, so she's often dragged along on his schemes."
535,2020-04-11 15:19:40,Twokinds,Finally got breakfast

647,2020-04-11 15:41:49,Twokinds,Quite a few funny ones
739,2020-04-11 15:53:30,Twokinds,Stream in 10 min
876,2020-04-11 16:06:16,Twokinds,ok
1419,2020-04-11 16:53:43,Twokinds,Hm
1421,2020-04-11 16:53:55,Twokinds,I don't think... Maren and Natani have ever interacted.
1436,2020-04-11 16:54:48,Twokinds,"No, just interesting"
1448,2020-04-11 16:55:33,Twokinds,"I searched the gallery, and this is the ONLY sketch where they're technically in the same picture https://www.patreon.com/posts/christmas-23532971"

2002,2020-04-11 17:48:02,Twokinds,No I mean the stream recording
2010,2020-04-11 17:48:47,Twokinds,"Ok, so I don't need to restart"
2011,2020-04-11 17:48:52,Twokinds,The recording is fine?

2717,2020-04-11 18:55:57,Twokinds,Wolves don't fight their mates
2732,2020-04-11 18:56:45,Twokinds,"I mean, traditional wolf romance is just code"

3422,2020-04-11 19:51:50,Twokinds,Thanks. I enjoyed drawing Nora again
3429,2020-04-11 19:52:31,Twokinds,There was a point where I considered cutting the page
3436,2020-04-11 19:53:01,Twokinds,"Because there'd been a long gap, and I thought maybe people would like to come back to just a flashback, since it technically could be skippable."
3437,2020-04-11 19:53:08,Twokinds,But I just thought it'd be a shame to lose the scene.
3438,2020-04-11 19:53:16,Twokinds,wouldn't*
3475,2020-04-11 19:55:17,Twokinds,Yes
3476,2020-04-11 19:55:19,Twokinds,I'm working on it
3477,2020-04-11 19:55:23,Twokinds,We're reprinting a lot
3488,2020-04-11 19:56:30,Twokinds,Maybe
3496,2020-04-11 19:57:15,Twokinds,"Uh... well, the stoney thing was another scene I was going to skip"
3498,2020-04-11 19:57:28,Twokinds,But at the last minute I decided to change the two panels to include it
3500,2020-04-11 19:57:34,Twokinds,And just push the door to the next page
3513,2020-04-11 19:58:51,Twokinds,I decided to include it to give Stoney more personality..
3514,2020-04-11 19:58:59,Twokinds,"I can't draw, so many questions"
3869,2020-04-11 20:34:53,Twokinds,it's pronounced exactly how it's spelled

4412,2020-04-11 21:29:31,Twokinds,"I'm looking into buying a generator for my house, so I'm not without power again."
4419,2020-04-11 21:30:45,Twokinds,I'd just need enough to power the computer and internet
4433,2020-04-11 21:33:54,Twokinds,That's more than I know how to do. I'm just looking for a small unit that I can plug my computer stuff.
4434,2020-04-11 21:34:16,Twokinds,Would need to generate clean power
4441,2020-04-11 21:36:02,Twokinds,"Yeah, an inverter looks like what I need"
4447,2020-04-11 21:37:51,Twokinds,"Uh, just gas"
4456,2020-04-11 21:40:55,Twokinds,"I don't need wifi, I can just plug in the modem."
4458,2020-04-11 21:41:37,Twokinds,Unless something really bad happened and the internet lines are down too
4459,2020-04-11 21:41:59,Twokinds,Then I guess I'd have to get internet off my phone
4513,2020-04-11 22:00:11,Twokinds,Generators are so expensive
4523,2020-04-11 22:02:33,Twokinds,The one recommended was $1k
4530,2020-04-11 22:03:25,Twokinds,"The Honda one, which is apparently the one everyone say to get, is actually more than $2k"
4531,2020-04-11 22:03:30,Twokinds,But that seems a little excessive
4553,2020-04-11 22:06:49,Twokinds,I've heard the noninverter ones don't play nice with a lot of UPSs
4554,2020-04-11 22:06:57,Twokinds,Cause of the power fluxuations.
4580,2020-04-11 22:11:31,Twokinds,I wish I knew more about electrical stuff. I only have the vaguest notions about it.
4582,2020-04-11 22:11:59,Twokinds,My computer has a 750w power supply. Does that mean it uses at most that?
4587,2020-04-11 22:12:14,Twokinds,See above
4593,2020-04-11 22:13:07,Twokinds,ok
4597,2020-04-11 22:14:25,Twokinds,Right now my UPS says it's under 175w of load.
4600,2020-04-11 22:14:38,Twokinds,"Which seems like a low amount, but I'm not doing anything but typing here."
4606,2020-04-11 22:15:48,Twokinds,"The one I'm looking at, the $1k one, is 3000W"
4610,2020-04-11 22:16:17,Twokinds,"The cheaper ones, in the $500 - $800 range, are 2000"
4624,2020-04-11 22:20:20,Twokinds,https://amazon.com/dp/B01FAWMMEY
4632,2020-04-11 22:22:14,Twokinds,Yeah this might be overkill
4642,2020-04-11 22:26:18,Twokinds,That 2000 champion looks pretty good

236,2020-04-12 16:56:39,Twokinds,yeah the honda ones are very expensive. Though I assume they're quality.

1482,2020-04-17 18:32:27,Twokinds,It's why she was sidelined in all but the side comics
1486,2020-04-17 18:33:00,Twokinds,"And in her place is Reni, a young dragon untrained in magic."
1493,2020-04-17 18:33:59,Twokinds,"Oh yeah, she's still a giant lizard"

499,2020-04-18 15:37:12,Twokinds,You guys just need to tell me if I forget to turn on the music tracker
500,2020-04-18 15:37:18,Twokinds,Otherwise it's just going to be stuck forever
514,2020-04-18 15:38:50,Twokinds,"Well I can't always remember. If you want to know the song, you gotta remind me."

1284,2020-04-18 17:00:01,Twokinds,Usually during the day the bed is repurposed as a sitting place.
1286,2020-04-18 17:00:11,Twokinds,So there's pillows around it that act as seats.
1294,2020-04-18 17:00:25,Twokinds,And the mattress can be lifted to a way to make a table.
1320,2020-04-18 17:02:06,Twokinds,You kinda have to be. Most Keidran houses can't afford to have a lot of furnature.
1323,2020-04-18 17:02:19,Twokinds,The bed is the most expensive purchase most make for their homes.
1326,2020-04-18 17:02:28,Twokinds,And it takes up a lot of space
1327,2020-04-18 17:02:31,Twokinds,So gotta be creative.

2522,2020-04-18 18:35:55,Twokinds,Now I gotta figure out how to make a dragon hula

327,2020-04-19 20:26:29,Twokinds,For fairness' sake.
332,2020-04-19 20:28:28,Twokinds,"It used to be just in the order they were sketched, but I felt like that was introducing a biasing factor."

1785,2020-05-16 18:32:09,Twokinds,It can leave the estate.
1788,2020-05-16 18:32:18,Twokinds,It's self powered.

1243,2020-05-21 22:45:23,Twokinds,"It's fools other senses too. Sight, sound, touch, proprioception, etc"
1273,2020-05-21 22:50:10,Twokinds,The illusions interact with physical matter just fine.

1466,2020-05-21 23:21:04,Twokinds,He wouldn't have a rat. Or any sort of rodent or rodent-like pet.

2061,2020-05-23 19:42:59,Twokinds,Same way humans look at apes. Weirdly similiar in a lot of ways.
2071,2020-05-23 19:44:04,Twokinds,Not really. Some wolves have wolves as pets.
2079,2020-05-23 19:44:37,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
2087,2020-05-23 19:45:27,Twokinds,There was actually supposed to be a scene in Twokinds where the characters encountered wolves
2091,2020-05-23 19:45:38,Twokinds,"And Keith asked Natani to talk to them, and Natani looked insulted"
2210,2020-05-23 20:00:11,Twokinds,Done

1551,2020-05-24 22:15:29,Twokinds,Seemed like a good time
1606,2020-05-24 22:28:31,Twokinds,Thanks w0lf!
1608,2020-05-24 22:28:37,Twokinds,I like doing special effects
1710,2020-05-24 22:58:16,Twokinds,"Most of Natani's spells are basic, raw elemental magic."
1711,2020-05-24 22:58:24,Twokinds,Which is the simpliest form of offensive magic.
1713,2020-05-24 22:58:34,Twokinds,"So, wind, fire, lightning, ice, water, etc"
1719,2020-05-24 22:59:15,Twokinds,"Natani has very few ""advance spells""."
1722,2020-05-24 22:59:38,Twokinds,Pretty much just the heart's desire spell and the mark and recall spell.
1724,2020-05-24 23:00:01,Twokinds,"And scent covering, of course."
1731,2020-05-24 23:01:18,Twokinds,"Every two-bit assassin type knows the scent covering spell, as it's dead useful among wolves."
1736,2020-05-24 23:01:57,Twokinds,"And yeah, mark and recall is just... marking a place, and then teleporting back to it. It's the most basic teleport spell, as it requires you to have already been there and set it up ahead of time."
1747,2020-05-24 23:04:23,Twokinds,"Natani's pretty good, though... I'm not sure how well Natani would do in a traditional academic setting."
1748,2020-05-24 23:04:39,Twokinds,Something tells me he'd be the type to slack off.
1760,2020-05-24 23:06:21,Twokinds,Natani's a pretty practical wolf. Learn what's useful. But the fundimentals necessary to learn advanced magic might be too frustrating.
1766,2020-05-24 23:08:17,Twokinds,"For the bandages, Natani doesn't know how it works, just that it does. It's a copy and paste job."
1769,2020-05-24 23:09:04,Twokinds,Probably from some sort of enchanted bag or something that displaces it's content's mass.
1812,2020-05-24 23:17:28,Twokinds,"No, it can't displace very much mass."
1822,2020-05-24 23:19:26,Twokinds,Possibly
1844,2020-05-24 23:24:41,Twokinds,"In canon, no. XD"
1854,2020-05-24 23:27:37,Twokinds,"I guess I don't see why not, but it's too exploity to actually have something like in the main comic XD"
1857,2020-05-24 23:28:15,Twokinds,I'm pretty much done
1873,2020-05-24 23:29:41,Twokinds,Sure
1877,2020-05-24 23:29:58,Twokinds,I like making things glowy ^^
1900,2020-05-24 23:31:18,Twokinds,"I gotta add text and post this, then I can play"

2162,2020-06-06 19:06:00,Twokinds,It's considered gimmicky. Most people just buy the flavor they want.
2178,2020-06-06 19:06:48,Twokinds,True

2418,2020-06-06 19:26:48,Twokinds,It seems a bit excessive
2487,2020-06-06 19:36:48,Twokinds,Dragons have their own unique style of cuisine.
2488,2020-06-06 19:36:56,Twokinds,Most isn't very palatable to bipeds.

2654,2020-06-06 19:52:27,Twokinds,When I'm in the mood for spicy I want... an ordeal.
2661,2020-06-06 19:53:19,Twokinds,"Well, no, I don't like things way too spicy"
2663,2020-06-06 19:53:24,Twokinds,Then I don't get any flavor
2664,2020-06-06 19:53:29,Twokinds,I like a good balance

31,2020-06-08 16:32:35,Twokinds,It makes it extremely hard to concentrate on the work I need to get done.
55,2020-06-08 17:36:38,Twokinds,Yesterday I started taking a generic version of Clariten. Hoping it improves things

27,2020-06-09 01:22:04,Twokinds,I'll get that transcript put up
28,2020-06-09 01:22:21,Twokinds,I just forgot to update it. I had several people message me about it

53,2020-06-09 01:52:40,Twokinds,"Well, I don't know."
54,2020-06-09 01:52:57,Twokinds,I don't usually take allergy meds regularly. I'm just saying I haven't noticed it yet.
58,2020-06-09 01:54:16,Twokinds,"Well, then they seem fine."
82,2020-06-09 02:13:57,Twokinds,I also vaccuumed and changed the filters of my air purifier.
83,2020-06-09 02:14:01,Twokinds,Hoping that helps too.
89,2020-06-09 02:18:27,Twokinds,Yeah I usually remember to change it
99,2020-06-09 02:39:10,Twokinds,"Dragons are creatures of magic, for sure. It comes to them naturally, but they do still have to learn how to use it. Reni's only 20 and hasn't trained any combat magic."

16,2020-06-24 15:11:45,Twokinds,They disabled the ability for non-patrons to leave comments. And there's no way for me to allow it.
19,2020-06-24 15:16:38,Twokinds,I don't understand why companies can't leave well enough alone.

218,2020-06-25 20:52:36,Twokinds,it depends on the lighting. I generally use a reddish brown #914d2d
220,2020-06-25 20:53:18,Twokinds,But when I'm taking shading seriously I'll generally use a grey blue and work my way to warmer colors towards light sources. It also depends on what color it's shading.
221,2020-06-25 20:53:26,Twokinds,"I usually shade white fur with blue, for example"

222,2020-07-11 14:57:32,Twokinds,Well there's still time
227,2020-07-11 14:58:53,Twokinds,Well I don't know why that would be. What do you want to suggest? I'll just pit it in there
229,2020-07-11 15:01:10,Twokinds,ok
279,2020-07-11 15:08:39,Twokinds,I haven't eaten today
282,2020-07-11 15:08:49,Twokinds,Can't
287,2020-07-11 15:09:53,Twokinds,Gotta finish
291,2020-07-11 15:10:34,Twokinds,"Can't, carbs."
313,2020-07-11 15:15:01,Twokinds,I prefer eggs over-difficult
324,2020-07-11 15:16:34,Twokinds,"I shuttered from revoltion drinking my cold black coffee, and ended up with some going up my nose. Gah"
328,2020-07-11 15:17:13,Twokinds,Get it right into the veins
1075,2020-07-11 16:58:55,Twokinds,I don't remember how to do a double update XD
1527,2020-07-11 17:57:21,Twokinds,Turns out this sunday stream is just going to be at the usual friday stream time XD
1538,2020-07-11 17:58:01,Twokinds,Sorry!
1540,2020-07-11 17:58:04,Twokinds,There's always the recording
1542,2020-07-11 17:58:09,Twokinds,And the 20x recording
1765,2020-07-11 18:29:46,Twokinds,I'm going to quickly grab some food and start the stream
1876,2020-07-11 18:41:43,Twokinds,"mmm, food"
1879,2020-07-11 18:41:50,Twokinds,"Sorry, I didn't eat all day until I finished the comic"
1882,2020-07-11 18:42:00,Twokinds,It's a... deconstructed burger.
1904,2020-07-11 18:45:45,Twokinds,Cold cereal is good.
1916,2020-07-11 18:47:14,Twokinds,no

2038,2020-07-11 19:03:22,Twokinds,It was probably the most challanging pages to draw I've had.
2044,2020-07-11 19:03:42,Twokinds,"I repainted the big panel 3 times, cause I didn't like how it looked."
2046,2020-07-11 19:03:51,Twokinds,Which is why it was so late
2062,2020-07-11 19:04:31,Twokinds,It just didn't look how I wanted
2064,2020-07-11 19:05:06,Twokinds,"I actually had this page sketched out months ago, but it went through a lot of iterations"
2137,2020-07-11 19:10:32,Twokinds,Sorry give me 2 seconds
2140,2020-07-11 19:10:36,Twokinds,I need to add the suggestions
2237,2020-07-11 19:22:52,Twokinds,If anyone is having trouble voting let me know
2238,2020-07-11 19:23:00,Twokinds,I didn't get a chance to check it beforehand which I normally do
2248,2020-07-11 19:24:33,Twokinds,To make sure it's working
2250,2020-07-11 19:24:47,Twokinds,And that everyone who's allowed to vote is allowed to vote
2286,2020-07-11 19:27:47,Twokinds,"you know what's funny, I had that ""Rose Garden Greenhouse"" file on my pc for month, and I had to be like ""plz o plz don't accidentally open this during a stream"" XD"
2297,2020-07-11 19:28:22,Twokinds,yeah big spoiler
2309,2020-07-11 19:29:16,Twokinds,Oh I've got future chapter stuff
2310,2020-07-11 19:29:23,Twokinds,"Don't worry, it's all happy and good"
2325,2020-07-11 19:30:26,Twokinds,Yeah
2378,2020-07-11 19:36:36,Twokinds,Hm...
2382,2020-07-11 19:36:59,Twokinds,Nothing :D

2948,2020-07-11 20:59:14,Twokinds,I'm not sure what to do with wolf raine
2963,2020-07-11 21:01:11,Twokinds,Uh...
2965,2020-07-11 21:01:17,Twokinds,That might not be healthy XD
2966,2020-07-11 21:01:22,Twokinds,I'm not sure how long this'll go
2969,2020-07-11 21:01:28,Twokinds,Don't keep yourself up on my account.
3040,2020-07-11 21:09:03,Twokinds,HI KAMELOH!
3043,2020-07-11 21:09:28,Twokinds,Oh thanks XD
3044,2020-07-11 21:09:32,Twokinds,I thought maybe you would
3047,2020-07-11 21:09:47,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-reniderp:
3107,2020-07-11 21:17:00,Twokinds,Ah I see Kameloh

3145,2020-07-11 21:21:15,Twokinds,It's in the upper half
3153,2020-07-11 21:22:40,Twokinds,hm...
3160,2020-07-11 21:23:28,Twokinds,not sure how to draw this
3165,2020-07-11 21:23:53,Twokinds,hm...
3167,2020-07-11 21:24:03,Twokinds,What clothes would they try on
3175,2020-07-11 21:24:35,Twokinds,There's already a pic of them in kimonos
3267,2020-07-11 21:42:49,Twokinds,I don't know what I'm doing XD
3280,2020-07-11 21:43:41,Twokinds,Some of them
3299,2020-07-11 21:47:17,Twokinds,Can someone please suggest something for Raine
3322,2020-07-11 21:49:33,Twokinds,oh this is your suggestion?
3324,2020-07-11 21:49:40,Twokinds,Did you have something in mine for Rose
3328,2020-07-11 21:50:05,Twokinds,I can do sundress and hat
3331,2020-07-11 21:50:23,Twokinds,I kinda thought maybe they'd be in a thrift store just trying on stuff
3386,2020-07-11 22:00:38,Twokinds,6am still here
3430,2020-07-11 22:07:39,Twokinds,Have a good one!
3431,2020-07-11 22:07:50,Twokinds,I imagine a lot of people will be dropping out soon ^^;
3435,2020-07-11 22:08:08,Twokinds,"We'll be going maybe an hour more or so, then I'll call it wherever we are."
3499,2020-07-11 22:15:49,Twokinds,Done
3530,2020-07-11 22:19:43,Twokinds,"Maybe a little, Elven."
3534,2020-07-11 22:20:17,Twokinds,Thift stores were better when they couldn't google the going price of everything.
3539,2020-07-11 22:21:10,Twokinds,"Used to be you'd find stuff that they had no idea was valuable. Still happens, but not as much."
3566,2020-07-11 22:24:38,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-nibsdance:
3609,2020-07-11 22:30:29,Twokinds,Pretty sure it already is
3656,2020-07-11 22:32:53,Twokinds,Ya gotta know your potatoes inside and out.
3657,2020-07-11 22:32:57,Twokinds,"Boil em, mash em, etc"
3877,2020-07-11 23:01:20,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
3934,2020-07-11 23:06:00,Twokinds,I will do the last pick off screen
3937,2020-07-11 23:06:08,Twokinds,I'm done for tonight ^^
3945,2020-07-11 23:07:01,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-florademon:
3947,2020-07-11 23:07:13,Twokinds,Since the moment I woke up
3949,2020-07-11 23:07:19,Twokinds,It'll be nice to take a break XD;
3954,2020-07-11 23:08:17,Twokinds,I'm really sorry about that.
3956,2020-07-11 23:08:37,Twokinds,I wish they hadn't changed it. I asked them to not have it that way.
3958,2020-07-11 23:08:38,Twokinds,Thanks!
3962,2020-07-11 23:08:51,Twokinds,I hope they change it back.
3968,2020-07-11 23:09:13,Twokinds,I do not care for them changing things without warning at a whim.
3976,2020-07-11 23:09:43,Twokinds,You have to be a patron to leave comments now.
3978,2020-07-11 23:09:52,Twokinds,"As far as I can tell, there's no way to allow anyone to comment."
4017,2020-07-11 23:13:26,Twokinds,1:45 to go
4028,2020-07-11 23:14:00,Twokinds,"Incorrect, 1:08"
4039,2020-07-11 23:14:31,Twokinds,Two color streams would be very hard on me
4066,2020-07-11 23:15:43,Twokinds,Alright!
4134,2020-07-11 23:19:13,Twokinds,That's all folks!
4138,2020-07-11 23:19:20,Twokinds,Goodnight!

80,2020-07-12 14:23:51,Twokinds,Could be
82,2020-07-12 14:40:04,Twokinds,in what regard
84,2020-07-12 14:40:50,Twokinds,They're probably within a year of each other
85,2020-07-12 14:40:59,Twokinds,"She's his big sister, so maybe a year or two older?"
86,2020-07-12 14:41:05,Twokinds,I hadn't really thought about it.
260,2020-07-16 21:23:16,Twokinds,I lived.
265,2020-07-16 21:24:28,Twokinds,I think I have all the votes collected
267,2020-07-16 21:24:37,Twokinds,Going to start the omnipoll and then get the stream started.
272,2020-07-16 21:24:56,Twokinds,The sketch stream sunday
296,2020-07-16 21:34:19,Twokinds,"Actually, it's kinda late, I might wait until tomorrow to post the omnipoll"
298,2020-07-16 21:34:27,Twokinds,Give any stragglers more time.
300,2020-07-16 21:34:56,Twokinds,"There wasn't as many as last week, so some people didn't submit yet"
312,2020-07-16 21:36:47,Twokinds,"I haven't done an omnipoll since March, but it's all the sketch suggestions put in one poll, and voted on by Patrons."
313,2020-07-16 21:37:01,Twokinds,I'll be putting it up tomorrow.
330,2020-07-16 21:44:32,Twokinds,Very odd
339,2020-07-16 21:48:06,Twokinds,Well I already added your suggestion.
342,2020-07-16 21:48:18,Twokinds,From last week. Just let me know if you want it different.
356,2020-07-16 21:50:56,Twokinds,Hi! :ctwokinds-rainehappy:
371,2020-07-16 21:52:28,Twokinds,Pick your poison
438,2020-07-16 22:00:37,Twokinds,I doubt anyone would recognize this character haha
451,2020-07-16 22:01:34,Twokinds,That's honestly not too far off
452,2020-07-16 22:01:38,Twokinds,Mihari
516,2020-07-16 22:18:43,Twokinds,You got it!
520,2020-07-16 22:18:58,Twokinds,This is Mzzkiti
554,2020-07-16 22:24:00,Twokinds,"Yeah, she's a very old character. I was feeling nostalgic."
573,2020-07-16 22:28:04,Twokinds,"I'm not sure what the story is, but from what I can recall, one of the creators sadly passed."
576,2020-07-16 22:28:18,Twokinds,"I think, I'm not 100% about that."
680,2020-07-16 22:42:31,Twokinds,"I watch some when I can, sometimes."
788,2020-07-16 22:58:19,Twokinds,hiya purp

840,2020-07-16 23:05:44,Twokinds,"I was sad, but I'm also honestly relieved."
844,2020-07-16 23:06:18,Twokinds,Gives me some time to relax and focus on other things this year.
856,2020-07-16 23:07:57,Twokinds,"mmm, freeze dried"
895,2020-07-16 23:17:20,Twokinds,It has yet to be approved by the Nora Card holder.
1027,2020-07-16 23:38:18,Twokinds,I've had a pretty good connection tonight
1028,2020-07-16 23:38:20,Twokinds,Better than usual
1092,2020-07-16 23:48:47,Twokinds,I didn't get that it was a pun for a long time.
1093,2020-07-16 23:49:00,Twokinds,Which I should have since everyone's name in the comic was a pun.
1152,2020-07-16 23:59:54,Twokinds,?
0,2020-07-17 00:00:02,Twokinds,Everything looks fine on my end
40,2020-07-17 00:06:18,Twokinds,very early 2000's
43,2020-07-17 00:06:29,Twokinds,I know it looked like that as far back as 2002
65,2020-07-17 00:09:50,Twokinds,"I know it's just nostalgia talking, but I really enjoyed the internet back then."
68,2020-07-17 00:10:34,Twokinds,Everyone was amature. Websites were little scattered islands you discovered or heard about.
193,2020-07-17 00:41:52,Twokinds,Thanks
194,2020-07-17 00:41:56,Twokinds,I'm kinda just experimenting
196,2020-07-17 00:42:05,Twokinds,A sunset beach is a lot harder than a normal one
386,2020-07-17 01:21:29,Twokinds,night!
415,2020-07-17 01:28:31,Twokinds,Night!
416,2020-07-17 01:28:35,Twokinds,I'm done as well actually
434,2020-07-17 01:29:34,Twokinds,Thanks!
437,2020-07-17 01:29:39,Twokinds,Byebye!
464,2020-07-17 03:46:27,Twokinds,"Yeah, I think it could have had potential, but it never really got off the ground."
466,2020-07-17 03:47:09,Twokinds,"Honestly, feels familiar. A lot of my deadend comic projects are that way. A cast and ideas, but no substance."
468,2020-07-17 03:48:50,Twokinds,oh my
473,2020-07-17 03:57:04,Twokinds,mmhm
474,2020-07-17 03:57:17,Twokinds,"Welp, time to sleep."

591,2020-07-17 17:16:42,Twokinds,"It took me forever to compile them, I really hope there's nothing left out."
593,2020-07-17 17:20:23,Twokinds,you know
594,2020-07-17 17:20:27,Twokinds,the poll
596,2020-07-17 17:21:05,Twokinds,HUGE
601,2020-07-17 17:49:37,Twokinds,There it is. Let me know if there's anything wrong with it so I can fix the issue asap
603,2020-07-17 17:59:26,Twokinds,Yeah ^^; I know

55,2020-07-18 13:08:16,Twokinds,Hola
61,2020-07-18 13:10:50,Twokinds,Yes
65,2020-07-18 13:26:03,Twokinds,hi
75,2020-07-18 13:51:46,Twokinds,Uh...
76,2020-07-18 13:51:55,Twokinds,I remember playing Medal of Honor: Allied Assault
77,2020-07-18 13:52:12,Twokinds,In 2002 XD
78,2020-07-18 13:53:05,Twokinds,IronHorse: Oh yeah? It's going now?
83,2020-07-18 13:55:25,Twokinds,Yeah
93,2020-07-18 13:58:18,Twokinds,I collect indie comics
103,2020-07-18 14:03:41,Twokinds,I'm currently in the process of printing a new edition of my first two volumes
106,2020-07-18 14:04:14,Twokinds,It'll feature updated cover art and correct some errors inside.
109,2020-07-18 14:04:33,Twokinds,It happens to us all.
115,2020-07-18 14:05:39,Twokinds,"Huh, I'm the opposite. I dread traditional art"
187,2020-07-18 14:40:53,Twokinds,"You're welcome, Deathclaw!"
273,2020-07-18 15:02:02,Twokinds,does anyone have that compiled list of suggestors
274,2020-07-18 15:02:13,Twokinds,"Also, give me a minute, putting together the winners"
298,2020-07-18 15:07:48,Twokinds,It's truly impressive
378,2020-07-18 15:21:30,Twokinds,"Ok, we'll be starting soon"
380,2020-07-18 15:21:40,Twokinds,Just trying to spice up the presentation of the winners a little bit XD
387,2020-07-18 15:21:50,Twokinds,Hard to make the reveal exciting when it's all over with at the start
393,2020-07-18 15:22:25,Twokinds,"That's the benifit of the stream polls, you never know what's going to win throughout"
396,2020-07-18 15:22:34,Twokinds,"But with the pre-poll, it's like... you know what the votes are"
399,2020-07-18 15:23:14,Twokinds,The only question is the tom picks at that point
451,2020-07-18 15:31:29,Twokinds,Sometimes the problem with votes is that I just don't know how to draw something XD
462,2020-07-18 15:32:52,Twokinds,"Well, true, but it's more difficult when the ideas are a bit abstract"
467,2020-07-18 15:33:38,Twokinds,Ok I quickly threw together an animation in 5 minutes
473,2020-07-18 15:33:53,Twokinds,To make the winning reveal a little more exciting lets go
475,2020-07-18 15:34:03,Twokinds,It's not an animation animation
482,2020-07-18 15:34:58,Twokinds,It's just moving boxes around
486,2020-07-18 15:35:03,Twokinds,True animation takes more than 5 minutes
541,2020-07-18 15:38:35,Twokinds,Well I couldn't fit all 115 on one page
549,2020-07-18 15:39:32,Twokinds,So you can be revealed
557,2020-07-18 15:39:52,Twokinds,...Ready?
567,2020-07-18 15:40:15,Twokinds,ok... 3... 2... 1...
584,2020-07-18 15:41:17,Twokinds,If I had more time I'd have made it fancier and adjusted the value
625,2020-07-18 15:43:24,Twokinds,In order
632,2020-07-18 15:44:14,Twokinds,It's not changed I just like doing things differently sometimes.
657,2020-07-18 15:46:32,Twokinds,Here's why I didn't include them all
658,2020-07-18 15:46:35,Twokinds,lol
659,2020-07-18 15:46:41,Twokinds,I can't even read it on my full sized screen
664,2020-07-18 15:46:59,Twokinds,And you can see why it took me so long to compile
666,2020-07-18 15:47:07,Twokinds,I have to make this graph
668,2020-07-18 15:47:12,Twokinds,Google forms doesn't provide it
692,2020-07-18 15:48:39,Twokinds,Haha
696,2020-07-18 15:48:54,Twokinds,"I mean it's not too bad, it juts requires an annoying amount of excel"
697,2020-07-18 15:49:03,Twokinds,"Which I'm not great at, always have to google how to do things"
699,2020-07-18 15:49:10,Twokinds,Like create a randomly ordered list of 30
707,2020-07-18 15:50:43,Twokinds,oh did you guys see today's sketch? I did that at 4-5amXD
709,2020-07-18 15:50:54,Twokinds,"I wish all my actions could be automated, that'd be great"
729,2020-07-18 15:52:29,Twokinds,ok
730,2020-07-18 15:52:57,Twokinds,Someone please remind me to update CURRENTLY WORKING ON if I forget. I always forget.
733,2020-07-18 15:53:14,Twokinds,I lost my tablet pen
739,2020-07-18 15:53:31,Twokinds,It was on the floor
773,2020-07-18 15:59:44,Twokinds,Not exactly
774,2020-07-18 15:59:57,Twokinds,It's isn't the same for Basitins as it is for Keidran.
785,2020-07-18 16:01:25,Twokinds,Basitins on the island are all pretty much on the same cycle.
794,2020-07-18 16:02:26,Twokinds,The male Basitins during the spring become aggitated and agressive.
796,2020-07-18 16:02:46,Twokinds,They're affected much more.
797,2020-07-18 16:02:53,Twokinds,They go through the rut.
810,2020-07-18 16:03:43,Twokinds,It's why they're separated
812,2020-07-18 16:03:55,Twokinds,"The males get very territorial, there's a lot of fighting."
820,2020-07-18 16:04:20,Twokinds,"Interestingly, Keith's never gone through it, since he's never been on the island during spring since becoming an adult."
829,2020-07-18 16:05:15,Twokinds,No to minimize it. It's being around women during spring that causes it.
841,2020-07-18 16:07:15,Twokinds,lol
855,2020-07-18 16:08:56,Twokinds,"Adelaide's personal guards are well trained to keep their emotions in check, though people do notice they're a little more protective of Adelaide than usual."
879,2020-07-18 16:12:45,Twokinds,Maddie didn't have official personal guards.
882,2020-07-18 16:13:03,Twokinds,Though Adelaide did have her watched at times.
888,2020-07-18 16:13:30,Twokinds,They had a hard time keeping up
1106,2020-07-18 16:38:41,Twokinds,Keith doesn't wear leg bindings anyway.
1119,2020-07-18 16:39:33,Twokinds,He's gone native
1160,2020-07-18 16:43:15,Twokinds,Big thunder outside
1194,2020-07-18 16:45:48,Twokinds,BIG thunder
1195,2020-07-18 16:45:51,Twokinds,right outside my window
1245,2020-07-18 16:49:07,Twokinds,"I first came across it on the internet in 98. Started reading webcomics in '99, but didn't really know it was a whole thing until a few years later though."
1475,2020-07-18 17:04:38,Twokinds,Doooone
1514,2020-07-18 17:06:03,Twokinds,brb
1533,2020-07-18 17:07:45,Twokinds,It's neither alive or dead. It's a magical construct in the shape of the girl she got killed.
1542,2020-07-18 17:08:13,Twokinds,It can become alive
1547,2020-07-18 17:08:41,Twokinds,Stoney is a magical constuct too.
1551,2020-07-18 17:08:52,Twokinds,Though he's pretty alive thanks to Nora
1554,2020-07-18 17:08:59,Twokinds,More alive than the others.
1602,2020-07-18 17:13:11,Twokinds,Thank you
1620,2020-07-18 17:15:11,Twokinds,This one I'm picking just cause it's been on the ballot for so long ^^;
1869,2020-07-18 17:43:07,Twokinds,Well maybe she did after getting caught
1902,2020-07-18 17:47:49,Twokinds,"""No more live Keidran."" ""Of course, ma'am! ...Well, time for plan B. Better get ze shovel"""
1911,2020-07-18 17:48:30,Twokinds,lol
1913,2020-07-18 17:48:38,Twokinds,"It'd be kinda hard though, since Keidran burn their dead."
1930,2020-07-18 17:51:02,Twokinds,Done
1973,2020-07-18 17:54:56,Twokinds,"I will just release them... oh no! Ze breaks! There they go, over that cliff!"""
1981,2020-07-18 17:55:24,Twokinds,"They land on a bush, fine. ""Dang it!"""
1984,2020-07-18 17:55:56,Twokinds,Uh... hm... I dunno
1985,2020-07-18 17:56:01,Twokinds,Not really

2749,2020-07-18 19:12:47,Twokinds,I'm taking a short food break
2751,2020-07-18 19:12:51,Twokinds,and letting the dogs out
2756,2020-07-18 19:13:01,Twokinds,So please come back in like 10 - 15 mins
2764,2020-07-18 19:13:21,Twokinds,me
2823,2020-07-18 19:19:58,Twokinds,Just imagine that dancing scene from Escaflowne
2825,2020-07-18 19:20:01,Twokinds,That's pretty much it
2831,2020-07-18 19:20:46,Twokinds,An old anime
2834,2020-07-18 19:20:56,Twokinds,Food's cookin
2836,2020-07-18 19:21:05,Twokinds,And by cooking I mean in the microwave

3116,2020-07-18 20:14:46,Twokinds,Flora wouldn't fight fair
3118,2020-07-18 20:14:53,Twokinds,Her first move would probably be to pants him
3164,2020-07-18 20:17:51,Twokinds,Done
3223,2020-07-18 20:22:19,Twokinds,I made a whole comic page about that
3229,2020-07-18 20:22:43,Twokinds,He doesn't mind on anyone but other Basitin

3255,2020-07-18 20:25:12,Twokinds,Certainly not!
3257,2020-07-18 20:25:17,Twokinds,That's how it was drawn.
3340,2020-07-18 20:31:24,Twokinds,That was easy

3897,2020-07-18 21:27:38,Twokinds,I've never seen Ghostbusters.
3925,2020-07-18 21:28:56,Twokinds,I know a little about Ghostbusters.
3928,2020-07-18 21:29:03,Twokinds,"It has an all female cast, right?"
3936,2020-07-18 21:29:16,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
3955,2020-07-18 21:30:05,Twokinds,I heard it was a big improvement over the original
3999,2020-07-18 21:34:14,Twokinds,Wow
4001,2020-07-18 21:34:20,Twokinds,How did they put together the results so fast
4006,2020-07-18 21:34:52,Twokinds,But like I hardly had the numbers on screen XD
4010,2020-07-18 21:35:09,Twokinds,I'm just impressed
4029,2020-07-18 21:36:59,Twokinds,I'm not sure I understand that one either
4030,2020-07-18 21:37:08,Twokinds,I guess... just those two things haha
4072,2020-07-18 21:40:49,Twokinds,Nothing got 0 votes
4080,2020-07-18 21:41:30,Twokinds,Perhaps the records are incomplete

4690,2020-07-18 22:45:26,Twokinds,I will do another stream tomorrow
4709,2020-07-18 22:45:56,Twokinds,Probably around the Friday stream time

4719,2020-07-18 22:46:16,Twokinds,(I also want to try out some designs first)
4725,2020-07-18 22:46:35,Twokinds,Not sure what he'd look like feminine
4779,2020-07-18 22:50:01,Twokinds,totally canon
4799,2020-07-18 22:51:24,Twokinds,I've noticed that tends to happen with Omnipolls XD
4803,2020-07-18 22:51:33,Twokinds,It's good to have variety.
4814,2020-07-18 22:52:27,Twokinds,I try to pick some wholesome ones
4832,2020-07-18 22:53:43,Twokinds,This is wholesome right?
4844,2020-07-18 22:54:07,Twokinds,"I didn't pick this one, w0lf!"
4847,2020-07-18 22:54:13,Twokinds,It was the voters.
4863,2020-07-18 22:54:49,Twokinds,Here w0lf. Cat against glass. Better?
4945,2020-07-18 22:57:33,Twokinds,"So many lines, every Sunday ^^;"
4978,2020-07-18 22:58:31,Twokinds,"That was a long one, sorry."

5001,2020-07-18 23:00:13,Twokinds,"Oh yeahm, I'm sure that'd have taken forever"
5002,2020-07-18 23:00:16,Twokinds,It's TWO things
5086,2020-07-18 23:19:25,Twokinds,50 is around the middle of the pack.
5088,2020-07-18 23:19:54,Twokinds,"I think that's another benifit of the Omnipoll, it makes it clear the general sentiment of ideas. Though, it's always disheartening if it's lower on the poll, I know."
5092,2020-07-18 23:20:34,Twokinds,"I do actually try to pick from various places - both high, low, and middle, when choosing my picks."
5098,2020-07-18 23:21:06,Twokinds,"I'll take the top 1/3, pick one, 2/3, pick one, 3/3 pick one."
5100,2020-07-18 23:21:13,Twokinds,"Not that mathmatically, of course."
138,2020-07-19 04:03:42,Twokinds,"I've included the poll results in the omnipoll post from yesterday, if anyone needs it."

919,2020-07-19 18:41:20,Twokinds,"Yeah, and himself."
920,2020-07-19 18:41:22,Twokinds,That's two things!
928,2020-07-19 18:41:53,Twokinds,"Technically, yeah"
931,2020-07-19 18:42:06,Twokinds,"Though the guild does have women, but not as part of the guild lol"
934,2020-07-19 18:42:32,Twokinds,"So I guess Brutus would have to be relabled as Clovis' personal girl. Which, I guess wouldn't change much."
945,2020-07-19 18:43:53,Twokinds,"Wolves in Twokinds are quite sexist, especially in both the upperclass and the underworld, somewhat ironically, the two ends of the societal spectrum."

1179,2020-07-19 19:30:48,Twokinds,It's not rigid or designed like cities or indoor stuff
1197,2020-07-19 19:32:29,Twokinds,"There's rules, of course, with nature. Structures in nature exist for a reason, but you can get away with more. It's more intuitive, for me anyway."

155,2020-07-22 18:50:33,Twokinds,My bad. It was censored for being too brutal
158,2020-07-22 18:51:07,Twokinds,btw are you guys satisfied with the number of votes you get for the color poll?
160,2020-07-22 18:51:47,Twokinds,"It used to be 3, now it's 5. I've even considered letting people vote for up to 7. Is more options better, or no?"
162,2020-07-22 18:52:41,Twokinds,True
164,2020-07-22 18:53:11,Twokinds,"I sometimes wonder if people just pick something to get up to the max, and then a lot of people end up pushing their 7th place least wanted pick to the point where it ends up winning against ones that people really wanted"

168,2020-07-22 18:53:29,Twokinds,I'm about it

174,2020-07-22 18:54:16,Twokinds,Either way
178,2020-07-22 18:56:03,Twokinds,But it almost means its less likely none of your votes will win
179,2020-07-22 18:56:20,Twokinds,Almost no one gets all 5 right
185,2020-07-22 18:56:48,Twokinds,True
186,2020-07-22 18:56:59,Twokinds,"For no, I'll stick with 5, I guess."
187,2020-07-22 18:57:18,Twokinds,"I did just increase it last month for 3, so maybe we'll stick with this for a while"

520,2020-08-08 16:15:15,Twokinds,A product made during the last D&D session yesterday XD
541,2020-08-08 16:16:39,Twokinds,"Cauis? He's my character, he's still alive so far."
547,2020-08-08 16:17:07,Twokinds,"He's the healer, though weirdly he's becoming quite the tank"
558,2020-08-08 16:18:17,Twokinds,oh don't ask me game questions
647,2020-08-08 16:31:00,Twokinds,They're... fine?
694,2020-08-08 16:38:51,Twokinds,I dunno
699,2020-08-08 16:39:04,Twokinds,Dragons don't take much interest in each other.
705,2020-08-08 16:39:17,Twokinds,"But I guess, if anything, size."
720,2020-08-08 16:40:04,Twokinds,"The larger a dragon, the older it is, and thus usually the more powerful and more desirable."
725,2020-08-08 16:40:14,Twokinds,"But, you know, dragons are just like people, they have their own individual interests."
727,2020-08-08 16:40:18,Twokinds,Hi Kameloh!
760,2020-08-08 16:41:59,Twokinds,"They keep growing, but the growth is exponentially slower as they age."
769,2020-08-08 16:42:37,Twokinds,"The dragons of twokinds are shapeshifters, so obviously physical attraction is a bit meaningless."
779,2020-08-08 16:43:38,Twokinds,"They have a default size, which requires no energy to maintain. They can make themselves larger, but it takes more and more energy, so they can't stay big for long."
785,2020-08-08 16:44:04,Twokinds,"So a young dragon could pretend to be older, but it would be taxing, and they'd run out of energy pretty fast."
829,2020-08-08 16:51:29,Twokinds,There are technically bigger dragons. There's some that specifically do nothing but work on making themselves big. Puff themselves up.
837,2020-08-08 16:52:22,Twokinds,magic
838,2020-08-08 16:52:25,Twokinds,They're all beings of magic
861,2020-08-08 16:54:24,Twokinds,that ould be cute
1053,2020-08-08 17:11:46,Twokinds,Do you want just Илиар?
1068,2020-08-08 17:12:25,Twokinds,is that right?
1074,2020-08-08 17:13:11,Twokinds,I'm not used to writing cyrillic
1083,2020-08-08 17:13:55,Twokinds,done
1096,2020-08-08 17:14:30,Twokinds,Yeah wanted to draw Nora being a bit more serious this time
1332,2020-08-08 17:33:53,Twokinds,XD
1338,2020-08-08 17:34:31,Twokinds,I'm trying desperately to figure out how to get a dragon into a maid outfit
1348,2020-08-08 17:35:09,Twokinds,I don't wnat to make it human reni
1350,2020-08-08 17:35:11,Twokinds,it's not as funny
1361,2020-08-08 17:35:45,Twokinds,eh maid outfits aren't really sexy
1701,2020-08-08 18:10:04,Twokinds,Done
1758,2020-08-08 18:15:51,Twokinds,brb

2359,2020-08-08 19:18:02,Twokinds,huh? We're still at 992
2373,2020-08-08 19:18:50,Twokinds,Well unless someone finds which ones are missing the tag
2374,2020-08-08 19:18:54,Twokinds,It can't be sure
2395,2020-08-08 19:21:02,Twokinds,?
2637,2020-08-08 19:45:00,Twokinds,bye
2731,2020-08-08 19:52:45,Twokinds,I'm not doing well
2754,2020-08-08 19:53:49,Twokinds,"It's not working out, I can't draw at the moment."
2755,2020-08-08 19:54:06,Twokinds,"Wow, that's nice!"
2855,2020-08-08 20:01:57,Twokinds,yeah it's gone
2859,2020-08-08 20:02:06,Twokinds,I can't make art happen
3343,2020-08-08 20:48:02,Twokinds,"ok I did the best I could, I'll refine this at a later date."
4004,2020-08-08 21:56:53,Twokinds,Done
4025,2020-08-08 21:59:04,Twokinds,I'm done for tonight
4040,2020-08-08 21:59:40,Twokinds,"The ice cream went to her stomach, but not the way she'd ideally have wanted."
4047,2020-08-08 21:59:57,Twokinds,Time for the recap
4131,2020-08-08 22:05:47,Twokinds,"That's all for tonight, thanks for joining me! Sorry for the technical difficults in the middle"
4148,2020-08-08 22:06:43,Twokinds,Yeah perhaps catchup stream tomorrow
4160,2020-08-08 22:07:10,Twokinds,NO
4165,2020-08-08 22:07:47,Twokinds,I just hate getting up so early
4167,2020-08-08 22:07:56,Twokinds,It'll probably be around 8 if it happens
4180,2020-08-08 22:10:20,Twokinds,You're welcome!

174,2020-08-09 21:03:25,Twokinds,I spent the last hour trying to count how many sketches there are
177,2020-08-09 21:04:06,Twokinds,But all the numbers I'm getting say we actually already passed 1000.
181,2020-08-09 21:04:35,Twokinds,"Trying to count every sketch, not counting bonuses or alternate version, I got 1013"
185,2020-08-09 21:05:23,Twokinds,I don't know
186,2020-08-09 21:05:32,Twokinds,"Like, my count was 1013 - 1016"
188,2020-08-09 21:05:52,Twokinds,"But that could be off by a couple if I missed one, or accidentally counted an alternate duplicate."
192,2020-08-09 21:06:50,Twokinds,I have no clue why patreon still says 992 if that's not the true number
193,2020-08-09 21:07:04,Twokinds,"It seems to be stuck, since it said 992 yesterday."
195,2020-08-09 21:07:23,Twokinds,But I can't keep counting.
196,2020-08-09 21:07:33,Twokinds,"We hit it, or will hit sometime around now."
210,2020-08-09 21:14:28,Twokinds,"Since we hit 1000, I might try a contest where I ask people their favorite sketches."
211,2020-08-09 21:14:43,Twokinds,I would be interested to see which ones people liked the most.
215,2020-08-09 21:16:17,Twokinds,heheh maybe more sketches
216,2020-08-09 21:16:34,Twokinds,"Yeah, that was a good one."
219,2020-08-09 21:17:05,Twokinds,mmmhm
227,2020-08-09 21:19:25,Twokinds,"Patreon does not allow for games of chance, so I can't do a random lottery. Therefore, it would have to be not Patreon only."
228,2020-08-09 21:19:54,Twokinds,"I would have it somewhere else, and anyone can participate by naming their faveorite sketch(es)"
232,2020-08-09 21:20:56,Twokinds,I'm not sure.
235,2020-08-09 21:21:21,Twokinds,"It's hard, there's not a good place to do it."
239,2020-08-09 21:21:37,Twokinds,"the forums aren't very active anymore, and DA isn't very active anymore."
240,2020-08-09 21:21:40,Twokinds,"Twitter, maybe."
243,2020-08-09 21:22:03,Twokinds,lol
244,2020-08-09 21:22:19,Twokinds,I dunno
247,2020-08-09 21:23:00,Twokinds,Well...
252,2020-08-09 21:23:37,Twokinds,I was kinda thinking I'd color the sketch
257,2020-08-09 21:24:17,Twokinds,"Well, no, I'd just pick one that didn't have color already."
261,2020-08-09 21:25:23,Twokinds,No any year
267,2020-08-09 21:27:56,Twokinds,I don't think so
273,2020-08-09 21:31:21,Twokinds,I didn't have a tournament in mind
275,2020-08-09 21:31:55,Twokinds,"Just, name your favorite sketch, and your in the raffle."
281,2020-08-09 21:33:03,Twokinds,"Well, it'd be fine to name more than one if you want. XD Though if I did do this, I think only one would get the color treatment."
282,2020-08-09 21:33:32,Twokinds,"So if your name was drawn, you'd have to pick."
287,2020-08-09 21:35:04,Twokinds,"Yeah, I dunno, something casual."
288,2020-08-09 21:35:10,Twokinds,I'm not sure.
319,2020-08-09 21:41:06,Twokinds,lol
323,2020-08-09 21:41:16,Twokinds,Could use marbles
326,2020-08-09 21:41:34,Twokinds,but I don't have mables
381,2020-08-09 21:53:30,Twokinds,night!

360,2020-08-10 21:12:44,Twokinds,Just shrinkin her down a wee bit
361,2020-08-10 21:12:58,Twokinds,"She's a short fox, so maybe a little too long in the legs, I think that's good now."
414,2020-08-10 21:52:57,Twokinds,Done
421,2020-08-10 21:54:26,Twokinds,And that finally makes seven
424,2020-08-10 21:54:40,Twokinds,I also finished the other sketches

22,2020-08-12 02:03:27,Twokinds,I'm going to painstakingly count every suggestion from the beginning.
26,2020-08-12 02:05:32,Twokinds,"Man, Nov 2016. So long ago, and yet, it doesn't feel so long."
30,2020-08-12 02:06:25,Twokinds,"Yeah, it is. I have to go month by month or it slows to a crawl."
32,2020-08-12 02:06:41,Twokinds,"So I'm starting in Nov 2016, and going through each post one by one"
43,2020-08-12 02:11:15,Twokinds,Only the official sunday sketches that started on Nov 6 and onward count
44,2020-08-12 02:11:20,Twokinds,The ones that were suggestions
49,2020-08-12 02:14:10,Twokinds,there's your sketch
50,2020-08-12 02:14:17,Twokinds,I always remember it was one of the first.
52,2020-08-12 02:14:24,Twokinds,And first to color
134,2020-08-12 03:16:22,Twokinds,I'm at Jun 2018 so far
136,2020-08-12 03:21:38,Twokinds,tallying the sketches
141,2020-08-12 03:24:44,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-renirar:
173,2020-08-12 03:36:24,Twokinds,Baby Nibbly was exactly 100 sketches ago
203,2020-08-12 04:00:58,Twokinds,How can it already been august
207,2020-08-12 04:03:11,Twokinds,"No, I'm not planning on anything"
209,2020-08-12 04:03:33,Twokinds,Just counting to make sure everything is right. Didn't forget to label any Sunday Sketches
213,2020-08-12 04:06:48,Twokinds,Those don't count
214,2020-08-12 04:07:06,Twokinds,only sketches that say 'suggested by'
216,2020-08-12 04:09:44,Twokinds,ok
217,2020-08-12 04:09:47,Twokinds,I'm done
219,2020-08-12 04:10:15,Twokinds,"We are currently, as of right now, at 998 sketches, according to my counting."
220,2020-08-12 04:11:03,Twokinds,"I still don't know why patreon says 993, since I counted them from their website."
224,2020-08-12 04:11:36,Twokinds,They're not missing tags.
225,2020-08-12 04:12:00,Twokinds,I was checking both with no filters and with 'sunday sketch' filtered and comparing as I went.
226,2020-08-12 04:12:16,Twokinds,"I actually found one sketch that was mislabled as ""sunday sketch"" that wasn't."
227,2020-08-12 04:12:22,Twokinds,That was the only error I found.
231,2020-08-12 04:13:34,Twokinds,lol well more thanks to people who get on me when I inevitably make an mistake.
232,2020-08-12 04:13:37,Twokinds,But I try.
236,2020-08-12 04:14:59,Twokinds,Hey! It seems my 998 number lines up with Terra's spreadsheet
237,2020-08-12 04:15:02,Twokinds,That's good
239,2020-08-12 04:15:20,Twokinds,"Always possible for me to miscount, but I did try to double check myself each month."
241,2020-08-12 04:15:56,Twokinds,"Random fact: the month I posted the most sketches was May 2020, with 28 sketches."
245,2020-08-12 04:16:55,Twokinds,"I do like to have accurate data, but it's such a pain in the butt."
246,2020-08-12 04:17:33,Twokinds,"Also a lot of the early ones have problems not due to my own fault, but simply because Patreon only allowed like, 5 tags, originally"
247,2020-08-12 04:17:42,Twokinds,"Or 6, some small number."
248,2020-08-12 04:17:50,Twokinds,So I could only list a few characters.
250,2020-08-12 04:18:11,Twokinds,"If there were more than four characters, impossible to tag right."
253,2020-08-12 04:18:59,Twokinds,Yeahh
254,2020-08-12 04:19:01,Twokinds,heheh
256,2020-08-12 04:20:07,Twokinds,I would always try to add the most relevent characters.
260,2020-08-12 04:22:40,Twokinds,That's hopefully not an issue anymore.
261,2020-08-12 04:22:54,Twokinds,I do appreciate all the help.
262,2020-08-12 04:23:01,Twokinds,I wouldn't be able to do all this alone.
265,2020-08-12 04:25:39,Twokinds,"Ah, that's handy."
266,2020-08-12 04:25:41,Twokinds,Cool

404,2020-08-13 20:55:15,Twokinds,Did you get your new chair?
410,2020-08-13 20:56:52,Twokinds,...so did you get it?
441,2020-08-13 21:02:08,Twokinds,what chair
492,2020-08-13 21:11:57,Twokinds,Yeah it doesn't take place in the past
493,2020-08-13 21:12:00,Twokinds,It's a fantasy world
500,2020-08-13 21:12:27,Twokinds,Much of it is pretty modern.
545,2020-08-13 21:19:56,Twokinds,beep boop boop beep
659,2020-08-13 21:42:14,Twokinds,It depends
663,2020-08-13 21:42:41,Twokinds,I don't use it often but it is useful when you want to push things back
671,2020-08-13 21:43:42,Twokinds,I used a blurred background here to keep focus on the characters
893,2020-08-13 22:21:00,Twokinds,varian

929,2020-08-13 22:28:12,Twokinds,That's good to hear
932,2020-08-13 22:28:32,Twokinds,"Karen and Maddie are very similiar in many ways, but also fundimentally different in quite a few."

439,2020-08-15 15:21:13,Twokinds,The system is complicated.
441,2020-08-15 15:21:18,Twokinds,I don't fully understand it myself.
447,2020-08-15 15:21:48,Twokinds,But the top one is what you vote for unless that one gets knocked out then your vote goes to the next one down on your list. I think.
448,2020-08-15 15:21:56,Twokinds,So the order matters.

3614,2020-09-19 21:27:48,Twokinds,She was using this to get free manual labor but her body packed her in the box.
3625,2020-09-19 21:28:27,Twokinds,Yeah it requires context
3627,2020-09-19 21:28:39,Twokinds,She is dumb. She taped herself in a box.
3652,2020-09-19 21:33:21,Twokinds,"Normally she could just leave the lamp and go through objects, but maybe the box lid is keeping the lamp's top from opening. She can't go through her lamp."

182,2020-09-27 19:29:13,Twokinds,I'd have to make it a lot wider to fit that ratio
187,2020-09-27 19:30:12,Twokinds,I think I've decided I'm going to make scenery builder sets. Since I can't find anything like it online.

502,2020-10-03 16:24:22,Twokinds,ok 5 min
512,2020-10-03 16:24:50,Twokinds,It's gotten cold which is annoying

641,2020-10-03 16:37:08,Twokinds,Ready
664,2020-10-03 16:38:13,Twokinds,Sorry it took so long. Some of the suggestions were reallly long
688,2020-10-03 16:39:17,Twokinds,My hair is too long
784,2020-10-03 16:44:59,Twokinds,You just stay on the page
792,2020-10-03 16:45:37,Twokinds,Anyone not able to vote?
1143,2020-10-03 17:18:45,Twokinds,"Hey don't worry about it, MrMini!"
1148,2020-10-03 17:19:22,Twokinds,Thank you for your support!
1283,2020-10-03 17:32:10,Twokinds,done
1340,2020-10-03 17:36:27,Twokinds,lol
1341,2020-10-03 17:36:33,Twokinds,I remember that
1351,2020-10-03 17:37:41,Twokinds,"Since I pulled that joke last month with the typo, I told the suggestor that if they resubmitted, I'd go ahead and try the real way as a bonus."
1618,2020-10-03 18:02:12,Twokinds,I mean if Laura is anything to go by
1619,2020-10-03 18:02:14,Twokinds,That's very vixen
2382,2020-10-03 19:12:24,Twokinds,done
2416,2020-10-03 19:14:33,Twokinds,brb gunna grab fud
2946,2020-10-03 20:12:45,Twokinds,After writing it a thousand times it gets tiring
3054,2020-10-03 20:23:01,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-floAAA:
3200,2020-10-03 20:31:42,Twokinds,Oh I'm glad amenon managed to set that up for you!
3379,2020-10-03 20:53:28,Twokinds,later!
3628,2020-10-03 21:26:06,Twokinds,is it?
3632,2020-10-03 21:26:14,Twokinds,I was just having her feel for the clothes that aren't there anymore
3724,2020-10-03 21:33:36,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
3759,2020-10-03 21:36:50,Twokinds,Done
3837,2020-10-03 21:44:15,Twokinds,"I'm a little tired, I'm going to do the last ones later"
3844,2020-10-03 21:44:31,Twokinds,Let's see what gets picked
3853,2020-10-03 21:45:02,Twokinds,Uh...
3860,2020-10-03 21:45:28,Twokinds,Yeah
3874,2020-10-03 21:46:30,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
3888,2020-10-03 21:47:23,Twokinds,"Dragons don't have a lot of children, but Nora has had, by dragon standards, a lot."
3904,2020-10-03 21:49:28,Twokinds,"The problem with dragons in the Twokinds world is that they're so powerful, I really have to limit them a lot."
3907,2020-10-03 21:49:42,Twokinds,So I make it so there's just very little of them.
3911,2020-10-03 21:49:54,Twokinds,And isolated. Or they'd just take over.
3924,2020-10-03 21:51:25,Twokinds,"I mean, pretty much. They live on the islands. Mostly don't care about humans. Don't need gold or wealth for anything, so there's little conflict with mortals."
3941,2020-10-03 21:52:44,Twokinds,That's an interesting pick!
3948,2020-10-03 21:53:14,Twokinds,"I'm not sure how I'll go about that one, so I'm glad I'm putting it off so I have time to think XD"
3955,2020-10-03 21:53:38,Twokinds,"Man, that would be so awkward"
3968,2020-10-03 21:54:11,Twokinds,"I think maybe Laura and Keith would try to rekindle things, but find that after so long, it's difficult to relate again. Which would be tragic for Laura, who tries so hard to find him again."
3981,2020-10-03 21:54:46,Twokinds,XD
3991,2020-10-03 21:55:17,Twokinds,"Or, you know, poly relationship"
3995,2020-10-03 21:55:22,Twokinds,Laura joins Natani's pack
4045,2020-10-03 21:57:27,Twokinds,DO NOT ask me how it works
4049,2020-10-03 21:57:39,Twokinds,I dunno
4100,2020-10-03 22:00:36,Twokinds,"Alright, more later! Byebye for now!"
4124,2020-10-03 22:01:13,Twokinds,It's a very convincing prostesis
4202,2020-10-03 22:08:32,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-keith8D:
4233,2020-10-03 22:14:29,Twokinds,I mean maybe
4244,2020-10-03 22:16:13,Twokinds,I don't think so.
31,2020-10-04 13:45:48,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-nibsdance:

638,2020-10-08 20:56:50,Twokinds,hm...
644,2020-10-08 20:57:23,Twokinds,My wacom pen broke to pieces when I dropped it.
651,2020-10-08 20:57:45,Twokinds,"Nope, had to buy a new one."
662,2020-10-08 20:58:36,Twokinds,"I still dunno how it broke like that, though."
664,2020-10-08 20:58:43,Twokinds,They're usually pretty sturdy.
705,2020-10-08 21:05:40,Twokinds,that;d be interesting
751,2020-10-08 21:10:52,Twokinds,Literally just after a girl for her body
841,2020-10-08 21:28:11,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-nibsdance: Dancy Necromancy
854,2020-10-08 21:29:52,Twokinds,It is... uh... good
855,2020-10-08 21:29:57,Twokinds,when it's not extremely buggy
861,2020-10-08 21:30:22,Twokinds,It was unplayable the first night
863,2020-10-08 21:30:32,Twokinds,They did a second day patch which fixed it mostly
871,2020-10-08 21:33:08,Twokinds,I'm rogue first time
873,2020-10-08 21:33:14,Twokinds,gunna do wizard next
901,2020-10-08 21:39:57,Twokinds,I figure it's like a liquid inside
910,2020-10-08 21:42:55,Twokinds,Yeah?
928,2020-10-08 21:48:45,Twokinds,The special halloween?
967,2020-10-08 21:58:34,Twokinds,I think this is pretty good
971,2020-10-08 21:58:46,Twokinds,any qualms
980,2020-10-08 21:59:29,Twokinds,"Maren'll be fine. Well, her body will be. Just might be under new management soon."
991,2020-10-08 22:00:52,Twokinds,Maybe I should watch Ghostbusters this month
1023,2020-10-08 22:09:30,Twokinds,"No, not at all, probably"
1025,2020-10-08 22:09:41,Twokinds,"Trace wasn't thinking that far, though he'd have likely lied to her about what was involved."
1034,2020-10-08 22:10:34,Twokinds,Though it'd be hard to not notice she has a completely different woman's body suddenly.
1046,2020-10-08 22:11:15,Twokinds,lol
1048,2020-10-08 22:11:36,Twokinds,I think extending a Keidran's life span would involve a similiar level of sacrifice
1050,2020-10-08 22:12:05,Twokinds,Detritus is a shapeshifting monster he put his memories into. Think a mimic with his mind
1063,2020-10-08 22:14:27,Twokinds,"It was his first test. If he'd succeeded, he'd have resurrected Saria using the creature instead."
1069,2020-10-08 22:14:59,Twokinds,"But Detritus was a failure. It thinks he's Trace, but it's still a monster."
1070,2020-10-08 22:15:08,Twokinds,So it's insane
1081,2020-10-08 22:16:41,Twokinds,Mmhm
1093,2020-10-08 22:18:27,Twokinds,"Old Trace considered Detritus too danger to use. But he forgot it was still triggered to wake if Rose ever gained full power, since he never intended to ever lift Rose's restrictions."
1107,2020-10-08 22:22:32,Twokinds,She is floating
1114,2020-10-08 22:23:17,Twokinds,"She was originally going to be on a table, according to the script."
1116,2020-10-08 22:23:40,Twokinds,I changed it to the crystal to be more dramatic. lol
1121,2020-10-08 22:24:27,Twokinds,Seemed kinda lame to just have this giant room and one small table in the middle with her on it.
1123,2020-10-08 22:24:33,Twokinds,Couldn't really visualize it.
1193,2020-10-08 22:35:50,Twokinds,"Honestly, of all the villains, Clovis is probably the one most likely to break out into song"
1196,2020-10-08 22:35:56,Twokinds,Describing his evil plan
1264,2020-10-08 22:42:37,Twokinds,Howdie
1284,2020-10-08 22:48:08,Twokinds,Yeah he seemed pretty fun
1302,2020-10-08 22:53:10,Twokinds,>> Hold his stare.
1304,2020-10-08 22:53:16,Twokinds,HOLD HIS STARE HARDER

1458,2020-10-08 23:36:44,Twokinds,Very dynamic
1486,2020-10-08 23:45:42,Twokinds,"There's evil involved, and thus math"
76,2020-10-09 00:32:04,Twokinds,Aaaaand... doneio

1211,2020-10-10 17:21:11,Twokinds,Saria is much older than Trace.
1214,2020-10-10 17:21:23,Twokinds,She even says in TDM that Trace is too young for her.
1236,2020-10-10 17:23:18,Twokinds,There's only one calendar.
1286,2020-10-10 17:28:19,Twokinds,Not surprising

3282,2020-10-10 20:48:47,Twokinds,"Since the month split exactly at the end of October, it didn't matter which way it went, but since Oct is a holiday month, I gave it the extra week"
3304,2020-10-10 20:51:29,Twokinds,Done
3338,2020-10-10 20:53:17,Twokinds,brb!

3747,2020-10-10 21:36:05,Twokinds,There's nothing wrong with the computer
3754,2020-10-10 21:37:27,Twokinds,The tablet and the computer are two seperate devices
3755,2020-10-10 21:37:50,Twokinds,It's not an ipad

414,2020-10-15 20:29:30,Twokinds,Hi W0lf!
515,2020-10-15 20:33:04,Twokinds,This took a long time XD
544,2020-10-15 20:34:09,Twokinds,This was done purely in Photoshop
562,2020-10-15 20:34:51,Twokinds,Yeah
569,2020-10-15 20:35:08,Twokinds,It's a 20k image so it took forever
578,2020-10-15 20:35:17,Twokinds,20000 x 10000 px
592,2020-10-15 20:36:03,Twokinds,It really makes photoshop chug trying to paint in 3d at this res
595,2020-10-15 20:36:13,Twokinds,"So I had to go back and forth, painting in 2d and then seeing how it looked in 3d"
610,2020-10-15 20:37:03,Twokinds,In the final person I'll probably have Nora in the sky somewhere
617,2020-10-15 20:37:36,Twokinds,You're looking at the inside of a 3d sphere
623,2020-10-15 20:37:52,Twokinds,The scene is projected so it wraps around the viewer
648,2020-10-15 20:38:59,Twokinds,"Unfortunately, neither Patreon nor Deviantart supports panoramas"
651,2020-10-15 20:39:11,Twokinds,The only art site I know of that does is Artstation
656,2020-10-15 20:39:29,Twokinds,No legs
663,2020-10-15 20:39:46,Twokinds,I could put it onto my own website with javascript
672,2020-10-15 20:40:08,Twokinds,Quake fov
703,2020-10-15 20:41:34,Twokinds,I'll probably hide a bunch of stuff in the final version
708,2020-10-15 20:41:45,Twokinds,"And yeah, this was just done for fun."
710,2020-10-15 20:41:51,Twokinds,Oh yeah
712,2020-10-15 20:41:54,Twokinds,I plan to paint this
719,2020-10-15 20:42:07,Twokinds,It'll take forever I'm sure
743,2020-10-15 20:43:09,Twokinds,Here's was the art looks like flat
756,2020-10-15 20:43:44,Twokinds,The photoshop file is 1GB XD And it's just a 1 layer sketch
786,2020-10-15 20:45:48,Twokinds,yeah well photoshop isn't really meant for this I imagine XD
800,2020-10-15 20:46:47,Twokinds,"Well, ideally you'd just use a dedicated 3d software. XD But I'm not familiar enough."
870,2020-10-15 20:51:55,Twokinds,I'm working on the final touches of book 5. It'll be ready for print soon.
878,2020-10-15 20:52:23,Twokinds,ghost sheet
907,2020-10-15 20:54:04,Twokinds,Yeah I'm not sure how you'd do it
908,2020-10-15 20:54:13,Twokinds,Laura doesn't have that many distinguishing features
915,2020-10-15 20:55:21,Twokinds,Lots of people lack a life
928,2020-10-15 20:56:14,Twokinds,Yeah! I painted it quite a while ago.
935,2020-10-15 20:56:55,Twokinds,Book 5 was supposed to come out in July
937,2020-10-15 20:57:01,Twokinds,But then... uh... this year happened
945,2020-10-15 20:57:38,Twokinds,brb laundry
983,2020-10-15 21:00:07,Twokinds,Hopefully the next artbook
984,2020-10-15 21:00:15,Twokinds,"Fun fact, we're actually on Book 7 right now"
986,2020-10-15 21:00:27,Twokinds,It's on track to be about 200 pages.
987,2020-10-15 21:00:32,Twokinds,Book 6 is plotted out already.
991,2020-10-15 21:00:56,Twokinds,Not really
993,2020-10-15 21:01:10,Twokinds,"Right now my priority is book 5, and then I'm working on a short choose your own adventure story"
994,2020-10-15 21:01:17,Twokinds,And then book 6 and the next artbook
1032,2020-10-15 21:03:28,Twokinds,I like gamebooks so I'm hoping it's fun.
1046,2020-10-15 21:04:52,Twokinds,Oh yeah
1047,2020-10-15 21:05:02,Twokinds,Lone Wolf is great.
1295,2020-10-15 21:35:54,Twokinds,"The current chapter only has about 20 or so pages left, so I'll have to start thinking about the next one."
1386,2020-10-15 21:48:47,Twokinds,Thanks Fence ^^
1393,2020-10-15 21:49:48,Twokinds,"I can show it again, if you guys don't mind"
1404,2020-10-15 21:50:30,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-smug:
1425,2020-10-15 21:52:23,Twokinds,That's it
1432,2020-10-15 21:52:39,Twokinds,"Uh, getting this to work was pretty much my project for the last week"
1441,2020-10-15 21:53:23,Twokinds,"Really big image, 3d panorama"
1454,2020-10-15 21:54:09,Twokinds,I dunno how to show kame
1459,2020-10-15 21:54:18,Twokinds,"Oh, hi Kameloh!"
1498,2020-10-15 21:55:53,Twokinds,"This is that really big image I was talking about, Kameloh XD"
1505,2020-10-15 21:56:06,Twokinds,20000 x 10000
1516,2020-10-15 21:57:02,Twokinds,I know of some javascript that could display it. Or I could just put it on artstation
1531,2020-10-15 21:59:32,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-sytheeyebrows:
1555,2020-10-15 22:04:33,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-nibsdance:
1662,2020-10-15 22:22:44,Twokinds,Flora went through a fairly significant redesign around 2015 or so
1669,2020-10-15 22:24:07,Twokinds,"Not intensionally, but just in hindsight, it was quite the shift from before."
1687,2020-10-15 22:27:12,Twokinds,I could really go for some tea
1874,2020-10-15 22:52:25,Twokinds,o/
2013,2020-10-15 23:21:33,Twokinds,o/
2033,2020-10-15 23:24:09,Twokinds,Yeah!
2158,2020-10-15 23:39:48,Twokinds,Done
2173,2020-10-15 23:42:32,Twokinds,I get it
2199,2020-10-15 23:49:13,Twokinds,I think I'm gunna go for tonight
2228,2020-10-15 23:51:26,Twokinds,^_^
2229,2020-10-15 23:51:29,Twokinds,Night everyone!
2243,2020-10-15 23:53:04,Twokinds,XD
2247,2020-10-15 23:54:37,Twokinds,I was thinking I'm just gunna get one of those javascript 360 viewers and put it on the website. Or perhaps get an artstation account.
2257,2020-10-15 23:57:51,Twokinds,Yeah...
2258,2020-10-15 23:58:04,Twokinds,"If I got an artstation I'd have to actually use it, I guess."
2271,2020-10-15 23:59:14,Twokinds,Yep!
2274,2020-10-15 23:59:31,Twokinds,Sorry to cut and run but I'm sleepy
3,2020-10-16 00:00:21,Twokinds,I know DA doesn't.
4,2020-10-16 00:00:44,Twokinds,"I checked. Only art station as far as I can tell, out of the major art sites."
10,2020-10-16 00:03:02,Twokinds,Animating something like this would be pretty ambitious. Too ambitious for me. XD
14,2020-10-16 00:05:02,Twokinds,"I mean, it's more fun to look around yourself"
29,2020-10-16 00:09:48,Twokinds,And here we see the Western Basitins in their natural habitat.
362,2020-10-16 03:17:59,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
405,2020-10-16 14:01:03,Twokinds,morning
125,2020-10-17 15:01:26,Twokinds,I'll let you know when I'm about to start
182,2020-10-17 15:23:21,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-nibsbounce:
447,2020-10-17 15:55:48,Twokinds,no question
586,2020-10-17 16:15:39,Twokinds,what's mike dressed as
716,2020-10-17 16:31:22,Twokinds,brb
873,2020-10-17 16:48:33,Twokinds,uh
879,2020-10-17 16:48:57,Twokinds,"yeah mike's much smaller than Natani, but they're still probably much bigger."
910,2020-10-17 16:51:42,Twokinds,Done
951,2020-10-17 16:53:44,Twokinds,brb again
985,2020-10-17 16:57:29,Twokinds,"This has been in the suggestions a long time, so I think now's an appropriate time to pick it."
1108,2020-10-17 17:10:55,Twokinds,Twokinds very nearly started out as taking place in a game world
1113,2020-10-17 17:11:32,Twokinds,"No, not an Isekai"
1115,2020-10-17 17:11:42,Twokinds,Just a game world
1131,2020-10-17 17:13:48,Twokinds,The original first page had a text box saying Trace was lvl 7 or something
1132,2020-10-17 17:13:58,Twokinds,He was planned to be a fighter and Flora was a mage
1140,2020-10-17 17:14:39,Twokinds,Well yeah it didn't work
1298,2020-10-17 17:50:28,Twokinds,Sorry
1313,2020-10-17 17:54:27,Twokinds,That's kinda how I started too. I wanted to do games but didn't know how. But I could try to draw.
1339,2020-10-17 17:58:21,Twokinds,These characters are wearing a lot of leather
1340,2020-10-17 17:58:28,Twokinds,Every single one has leather gloves and boots
1343,2020-10-17 17:58:35,Twokinds,The artist clearly likes this look
1360,2020-10-17 18:02:25,Twokinds,Hiring someone to do 3d can get expensive
1391,2020-10-17 18:07:46,Twokinds,Done
1421,2020-10-17 18:13:12,Twokinds,"no, oddly"
1425,2020-10-17 18:13:46,Twokinds,"You'd think I would considering how much time I spend working on Twokinds, and how dreams supposedly reflect what you dwell on. But no, I don't dream about Twokinds."
1434,2020-10-17 18:14:29,Twokinds,I sometimes dream about drawing at my desk.
1561,2020-10-17 18:25:21,Twokinds,Just so long as Reni's not trying to jump on the heads of giraffes
1761,2020-10-17 18:58:36,Twokinds,Done
1880,2020-10-17 19:08:04,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-natsducky:
1893,2020-10-17 19:08:29,Twokinds,Wish I had spaget
1913,2020-10-17 19:09:04,Twokinds,I have pretzels
2419,2020-10-17 19:54:11,Twokinds,Done
2433,2020-10-17 19:54:32,Twokinds,"Thought this was appropriate, given the season"
2826,2020-10-17 20:42:23,Twokinds,Done
2900,2020-10-17 20:49:39,Twokinds,I'm hungry
2902,2020-10-17 20:49:43,Twokinds,I'm gunna break for food
2955,2020-10-17 20:57:32,Twokinds,"Sorry, meant to start the vote while I was gon"
2956,2020-10-17 20:57:35,Twokinds,brb again
2992,2020-10-17 21:03:10,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-reniderp:
2997,2020-10-17 21:03:51,Twokinds,Hey at least the witch costume is on dragon form reni XD
3122,2020-10-17 21:19:57,Twokinds,yeah
3163,2020-10-17 21:23:26,Twokinds,Maeve the snep queen
3185,2020-10-17 21:28:24,Twokinds,now sneps won't be quite so nearly extinct
3268,2020-10-17 21:37:52,Twokinds,"half tiger, half human, half snow leopard"
3348,2020-10-17 21:46:56,Twokinds,Imagine a snep in florida during summer tho
3381,2020-10-17 21:49:39,Twokinds,Done
3393,2020-10-17 21:50:23,Twokinds,I'm going to finish the laura one later
3399,2020-10-17 21:50:30,Twokinds,"But for now, I think I'm done for tonight"
3537,2020-10-17 21:57:14,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-sytheeyebrows:
3539,2020-10-17 21:57:17,Twokinds,bye!
85,2020-10-21 10:59:59,Twokinds,Oh don't spoil it
86,2020-10-21 11:00:05,Twokinds,"Dang it, I'm so sad"
89,2020-10-21 11:00:36,Twokinds,"I wanted it to be a surprise, and of course there's technical difficulties. It worked in the test site, but keenspot's having problems."
92,2020-10-21 11:02:03,Twokinds,the site guys are on it
93,2020-10-21 11:02:17,Twokinds,Sorry you guys didn't get to see it working.
94,2020-10-21 11:02:47,Twokinds,I went without sleep to get it finished.
103,2020-10-21 11:07:44,Twokinds,"It's working now, I think"
118,2020-10-21 11:18:10,Twokinds,This is the real reason why I was practicing 360 panoramics last stream
119,2020-10-21 11:18:20,Twokinds,I was testing for this anniversary page.
127,2020-10-21 11:20:42,Twokinds,The tavern waaaay harder
128,2020-10-21 11:20:49,Twokinds,Every straight line is curved
137,2020-10-21 11:21:41,Twokinds,"With nature, you can just make stuff up and well, things are bendy. Buildings? Buildings aren't supposed to be bendy."
147,2020-10-21 11:22:53,Twokinds,You can see in the stretched out version just how bendy things really are in perspective.
151,2020-10-21 11:23:41,Twokinds,The stretched out version wasn't supposed to be published
152,2020-10-21 11:23:48,Twokinds,But of course people grabbed it when it broke
155,2020-10-21 11:24:09,Twokinds,Yeah
157,2020-10-21 11:24:21,Twokinds,"I mean, nothing stopping, just wish they saw the way it's mean to be seen first"
160,2020-10-21 11:25:33,Twokinds,I'm going to sleep. I spent so many days on this.
161,2020-10-21 11:25:40,Twokinds,Did an all nighter.
368,2020-10-21 17:52:07,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-katwet:
375,2020-10-21 18:24:05,Twokinds,lol
376,2020-10-21 18:25:00,Twokinds,maybe
377,2020-10-21 18:25:42,Twokinds,But you can actually see that it's still broken all the way back on page 863
378,2020-10-21 18:25:43,Twokinds,http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/863/
379,2020-10-21 18:25:58,Twokinds,So I carried it over while painting this version.
96,2020-10-22 01:14:27,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-nibsdance:
105,2020-10-22 02:45:03,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
210,2020-10-22 20:04:46,Twokinds,o/
217,2020-10-22 20:06:29,Twokinds,I'm updating photoshop
218,2020-10-22 20:06:37,Twokinds,New version came out.
222,2020-10-22 20:07:14,Twokinds,Not sure yet. Currently saving all of my stuff just in case
224,2020-10-22 20:07:22,Twokinds,I don't trust software updates to remember all my settings.
266,2020-10-22 20:18:54,Twokinds,uh oh what
325,2020-10-22 20:45:12,Twokinds,It works fine
328,2020-10-22 20:45:21,Twokinds,Had a slight hickup importing brushes
330,2020-10-22 20:45:43,Twokinds,It said I had reached max number of brushes
336,2020-10-22 20:46:04,Twokinds,But it was a bug where they multiplied all my brushes
339,2020-10-22 20:46:16,Twokinds,"Er, dupped"
349,2020-10-22 20:49:33,Twokinds,One of the new features I'm most excited about is the new pattern maker assist
352,2020-10-22 20:50:24,Twokinds,It'll be good for textures
361,2020-10-22 20:51:27,Twokinds,"er... well, I mean, I guess. I don't know if it'd be good for fur."
362,2020-10-22 20:51:41,Twokinds,"It'd be good for things like ground, rocks, wooden wall textures"
363,2020-10-22 20:51:42,Twokinds,etc
365,2020-10-22 20:51:51,Twokinds,wallpaper patterns
366,2020-10-22 20:52:07,Twokinds,I'll show when I stream
370,2020-10-22 20:52:33,Twokinds,It's a boring thing to be excited about
382,2020-10-22 20:54:25,Twokinds,"Give me a little while, like an hour. I need to finish up a script before I can stream"
383,2020-10-22 20:54:31,Twokinds,Sorry
387,2020-10-22 20:54:40,Twokinds,I was distracted earlier
390,2020-10-22 20:54:47,Twokinds,"And well, I spent all my week on the filler"
396,2020-10-22 20:55:20,Twokinds,I'm still tired
397,2020-10-22 20:55:26,Twokinds,But about normal tired
399,2020-10-22 20:55:43,Twokinds,man I can't do all nighters like I used to
402,2020-10-22 20:56:13,Twokinds,"Yeah, then again, they've always been bad"
479,2020-10-22 21:21:47,Twokinds,"Nope, summer is gone yaay"
480,2020-10-22 21:21:54,Twokinds,XD
489,2020-10-22 21:22:33,Twokinds,"Can we just have eternal fall? That'd be nice. My allergies are finally going away, but it's not too cold yet."
491,2020-10-22 21:22:48,Twokinds,"Plus, cool fall colors"
515,2020-10-22 21:26:12,Twokinds,Just wait until Nora dives onto it
530,2020-10-22 21:27:46,Twokinds,It's just one image
531,2020-10-22 21:27:59,Twokinds,This is the image
534,2020-10-22 21:28:05,Twokinds,I literally painted it like this.
543,2020-10-22 21:28:36,Twokinds,Yeah
546,2020-10-22 21:28:42,Twokinds,It was incredibly hard around the edges
551,2020-10-22 21:29:09,Twokinds,Like this chandelier is perfectly round in perspective
552,2020-10-22 21:29:13,Twokinds,But I had to paint it like this
555,2020-10-22 21:29:40,Twokinds,Floorboards were the hardest
562,2020-10-22 21:30:04,Twokinds,Some of it was painted in 3D
563,2020-10-22 21:30:13,Twokinds,"Other times, I had to paint and then view it in the viewer"
565,2020-10-22 21:30:29,Twokinds,Getting the room's pespective right was the trickiest part
567,2020-10-22 21:30:36,Twokinds,"I tried to do it freehand, but I could never get it right"
570,2020-10-22 21:30:47,Twokinds,"In the end, I actually modelled the room out in 3d"
573,2020-10-22 21:30:59,Twokinds,"Then painted over with my own work, once I had something to work off of"
577,2020-10-22 21:31:19,Twokinds,hehee
580,2020-10-22 21:31:23,Twokinds,Wanna see the secret?
582,2020-10-22 21:31:30,Twokinds,This is how it started out
599,2020-10-22 21:32:18,Twokinds,I don't know 3d software all that well
603,2020-10-22 21:32:37,Twokinds,"So then I thought... wait, what if I download a program that lets me take pictures like this in minecraft..."
605,2020-10-22 21:32:40,Twokinds,and then just build the tavern
618,2020-10-22 21:33:21,Twokinds,"Uh, like an hour"
619,2020-10-22 21:33:37,Twokinds,Then I sketched over it
645,2020-10-22 21:35:46,Twokinds,Stuff like the floor was the hardest part cause it'd do stuff like this
654,2020-10-22 21:36:35,Twokinds,The seams were the last thing I fixed
686,2020-10-22 21:39:20,Twokinds,Here's what I was talking about with photoshop's new pattern maker
690,2020-10-22 21:39:36,Twokinds,"A texture like this would be hard to make, because of the seams"
692,2020-10-22 21:39:43,Twokinds,But I mocked this up in a matter of minutes
709,2020-10-22 21:41:11,Twokinds,No need to guess where the edges are going to line up now!
712,2020-10-22 21:41:12,Twokinds,:D
713,2020-10-22 21:41:15,Twokinds,It's brilliant
716,2020-10-22 21:41:19,Twokinds,I can paint anywhere on this
728,2020-10-22 21:42:01,Twokinds,XD
730,2020-10-22 21:42:13,Twokinds,I know it's not very exciting but I can see how this is going to speed things up for me a lot
860,2020-10-22 21:52:27,Twokinds,Been trying some more traditional looking digital painting
870,2020-10-22 21:52:51,Twokinds,Hi w0lf!
1015,2020-10-22 22:18:59,Twokinds,"Well, like I said in an earlier stream, she was just supposed to be on a table, but that's kinda boring"
1083,2020-10-22 22:28:50,Twokinds,"Oh, this is stupid."
1088,2020-10-22 22:29:17,Twokinds,The new version of Photoshop's line tool can no longer make raster lines
1097,2020-10-22 22:29:45,Twokinds,They want you to apply a stroke to a vector line
1101,2020-10-22 22:29:54,Twokinds,Which is just... way more steps than necessary
1112,2020-10-22 22:30:52,Twokinds,This makes no sense
1113,2020-10-22 22:31:00,Twokinds,If I wanted to make vector lines I'd just use the pen tool
1115,2020-10-22 22:31:03,Twokinds,It even works better for that
1146,2020-10-22 22:34:15,Twokinds,This is a really stupid change. I hope someone gets through to them and they change it back
1147,2020-10-22 22:34:22,Twokinds,There's no reason to remove features
1162,2020-10-22 22:36:22,Twokinds,"Adobe does a lot of cool stuff I find very useful, but they also do a lot of really mindbogglingly bad moves too."
1173,2020-10-22 22:37:36,Twokinds,Yeah I have both versions installed

1405,2020-11-14 18:23:48,Twokinds,I'm not sure what would constitute raunchy considering Willow goes around without clothes often XD
1449,2020-11-14 18:27:19,Twokinds,I think with this suggestion Willow's shown up in the modern setting more than the normal one.
1474,2020-11-14 18:30:07,Twokinds,"I was wondering if Keidran clothing stores would still have changing rooms, but I suppose they would. Still need somewhere to put your old clothes and stuff where it won't get taken."
1475,2020-11-14 18:30:12,Twokinds,"They might not have doors, though."
1906,2020-11-14 19:05:47,Twokinds,It's her own body
1909,2020-11-14 19:05:57,Twokinds,Who needs mirrors when you can just go into 3rd person mode
1912,2020-11-14 19:06:02,Twokinds,Hello!
2365,2020-11-14 19:39:33,Twokinds,She keeps the phone charged
2378,2020-11-14 19:40:04,Twokinds,Done
2397,2020-11-14 19:40:43,Twokinds,"In the future setting, keidran can still go around in the fur, though it's a little less common."
2423,2020-11-14 19:43:04,Twokinds,"Prudes actually tried to have it outlawed. One arguement was that it wasn't fair that keidran could be humans couldn't. This backfired, and now humans have the same decency laws as Keidran, though it's rarely used, obviously."
2729,2020-11-14 20:16:57,Twokinds,It will more so

2820,2020-11-14 20:28:14,Twokinds,It's pretty much a requirement for any bartender to learn a few simple bar tricks. Which are actual magic tricks in the Twokinds universe.
2831,2020-11-14 20:28:50,Twokinds,"Adira isn't a magic user though, these are just very basic tricks."
2846,2020-11-14 20:29:51,Twokinds,"Technically, there is no age limit for drinking alcohol for Keidran. But in the future, it's 8."
3032,2020-11-14 20:44:32,Twokinds,Done
3057,2020-11-14 20:45:54,Twokinds,"It is magic, it's just very basic."
3064,2020-11-14 20:46:16,Twokinds,"Adira knows specific tricks, but not how to do magic. It's like... copy and pasting code without knowing how to program."
3089,2020-11-14 20:47:42,Twokinds,A lot of people in the twokinds universe know little tiny bits of magic. Just specific things they picked up through their lives.
3099,2020-11-14 20:48:02,Twokinds,"But they couldn't for the life of them explain how it works, or apply it in a different context."
3100,2020-11-14 20:48:10,Twokinds,That's the difference between a layman and a mage.
3135,2020-11-14 20:50:03,Twokinds,knight!

3250,2020-11-14 20:58:13,Twokinds,A lot of canines are like Clovis or Carver.
3257,2020-11-14 20:58:44,Twokinds,But I don't know. I haven't really given much thought into how their society views same sex relations.
3274,2020-11-14 21:00:04,Twokinds,"There's obviously always going to be different opinions from person to person, since clearly wolves aren't all one hivemind."

1318,2020-11-28 17:24:14,Twokinds,She just becomes lighter.

2360,2020-11-28 19:45:40,Twokinds,I think Laura would definitely prefer to stay on the petite side.
2363,2020-11-28 19:45:52,Twokinds,Nothing wrong with being small.
2369,2020-11-28 19:46:09,Twokinds,She's shy. She likes not to draw a lot of attention.

116,2020-12-02 10:34:07,Twokinds,?
271,2020-12-02 10:56:15,Twokinds,It's not like you have to go into some crazy falsetto. Most audiobooks with a male reader tends to just go up a little when voicing female characters.
335,2020-12-02 11:12:11,Twokinds,Maybe.
367,2020-12-02 11:19:08,Twokinds,She probably couldn't go much smaller than a cat.

575,2020-12-02 12:05:52,Twokinds,"It was hard, because it's all white on grey on white with all these characters."
579,2020-12-02 12:06:47,Twokinds,I knew I needed a really dark background to contrast Nora's white coloring
599,2020-12-02 12:10:30,Twokinds,Yeah I think white and black are the most challanging for me
600,2020-12-02 12:10:42,Twokinds,It's why I struggle with night scenes
611,2020-12-02 12:13:45,Twokinds,I think I'm pretty much done
644,2020-12-02 12:21:00,Twokinds,I'm not particularly fashionably minded
661,2020-12-02 12:24:57,Twokinds,Well when you're wearing clothes everything gets pushed together. It'd be different if there were no fabric.
666,2020-12-02 12:25:55,Twokinds,haha yes 'interesting'
695,2020-12-02 12:29:53,Twokinds,"Maybe. Nora can make illusions, so certainly that. But making actually bodies? I'm not sure if that's within her power."
697,2020-12-02 12:30:01,Twokinds,"In the mindscape, easy."
703,2020-12-02 12:30:52,Twokinds,Nora promotes self confidence. Love Thyself.
705,2020-12-02 12:31:12,Twokinds,Though... perhaps not quite as much as Nora.
729,2020-12-02 12:33:22,Twokinds,I mean that's the story of Willow Wisp
731,2020-12-02 12:33:50,Twokinds,"She's a split off piece of her ""mother"" that ran away."
