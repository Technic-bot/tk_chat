707,2021-12-30 22:19:34,Roughlandin,I had this idea she was an ARA from an aquatic species' ship
708,2021-12-30 22:19:43,Roughlandin,So she was built to operate underwater
709,2021-12-30 22:20:08,Roarschach51,bARA is a hunk

1055,2021-12-30 22:55:37,IronHorseComics,oh yeah speaking of art...
1056,2021-12-30 22:55:47,StefanoDAngelo,Are they robots?
1057,2021-12-30 22:55:51,Roughlandin,ARA explaining how all the other ARAs ARA

1062,2021-12-30 22:56:14,Glassan,Sounds spicy... :ptv-uneasy:
1063,2021-12-30 22:56:15,ZrathSmiley,"If anyone here is on FurryMuck, I'm hosting an NYE party right now at the Big Cat Club."
1065,2021-12-30 22:56:22,KeefMcDerpface,"Iron, what?"
1064,2021-12-30 22:56:22,StefanoDAngelo,"Arara, that the name of an animal."
1066,2021-12-30 22:56:26,Roughlandin,No Iron!
1067,2021-12-30 22:56:31,Roughlandin,Don't go back there!
1068,2021-12-30 22:56:34,Roughlandin,That's the worst time!

1070,2021-12-30 22:56:51,Glassan,"Not quite the flashback one wants, there..."
1071,2021-12-30 22:56:52,xcvbTheHeteroSnail,"and remeber, the best part is the Bob Ross part :D"

1073,2021-12-30 22:56:57,justAblank,so ArarARA
1074,2021-12-30 22:57:22,ZrathSmiley,I need to go back to hosting. Good night!
1075,2021-12-30 22:57:25,Roughlandin,The Mink looks like the most Ara ara version of ARA
1076,2021-12-30 22:57:29,IronHorseComics,"I tried multiple things to get it all back, nothing worked. I had been resigned that there were some stuff that I would have to redo from scratch"
1077,2021-12-30 22:57:35,IronHorseComics,however...

1097,2021-12-30 22:59:02,IronHorseComics,this evening I found a thumbdrive in one of my desk drawers and decided to just plug it in and see  what was on it. Turns out I had earlier in December backed up everything into it
1098,2021-12-30 22:59:12,Roughlandin,Whew!
1099,2021-12-30 22:59:13,IronHorseComics,all my work has been saved

1106,2021-12-30 22:59:32,justAblank,maybe something like Warning's leg marking for the Mink
1107,2021-12-30 22:59:33,KeefMcDerpface,Nice Iron!

1118,2021-12-30 23:00:48,justAblank,there is a subtle beauty in plain designs

1120,2021-12-30 23:01:02,Glassan,subtle simplicity
1121,2021-12-30 23:01:15,justAblank,and a mink would be a good one to do that on 
1122,2021-12-30 23:01:23,IronHorseComics,"https://fluffy500.thecomicseries.com/comics/150/ Good thing too, I'm gonna need a few of my previous pages like this one to get the clothes colors correct for the current page "
1123,2021-12-30 23:01:38,Roughlandin,"I like the eyeshadow, Fluff"
1124,2021-12-30 23:01:41,Roarschach51,minkARA having a simple design is nice. It adds to the variability of the differences of the different frames
1125,2021-12-30 23:02:08,Roughlandin,"Definitely, adds a pop of color"
1126,2021-12-30 23:02:11,Draegwolf,mink is win

1129,2021-12-30 23:03:00,Roughlandin,I'd say pink but it'd clash with the bear's hair
1130,2021-12-30 23:03:22,Blobage,The red works
1131,2021-12-30 23:03:36,Roughlandin,Red would work yeah
1132,2021-12-30 23:03:39,justAblank,something that seams a little piercing might actually work for her 
1133,2021-12-30 23:03:50,Roarschach51,"Shifting to a different conversation, I like Flora's fancy dress, it's classy"
1134,2021-12-30 23:03:56,justAblank,like shes pretty but with one heck of a death stare 
1136,2021-12-30 23:04:16,Roughlandin,Yeah the backless dress looks really elegant on Flora
1135,2021-12-30 23:04:16,IronHorseComics,"I actually can't wait to get working on the next page, I've got some faces that are even more hilarious. Poor Shawa's gonna be so embarrassed "

181,2021-12-31 00:17:41,Glassan,Yep.
182,2021-12-31 00:17:48,Roughlandin,The literal definition of hag
183,2021-12-31 00:17:49,Glassan,Hags are legit scary in DnD
184,2021-12-31 00:17:50,Dadrobit,Played it through when it first came out. Such a ridiculously well made game.  Need to play the extended game on next gen.
185,2021-12-31 00:18:06,Roughlandin,Wish I could find a PS5 to play the DLC lol
186,2021-12-31 00:18:17,TheSexyBeast,Wasn't there one in the old Popeye cartoons?
187,2021-12-31 00:18:32,LegoP,Likely
188,2021-12-31 00:18:38,Dadrobit,Genuinely such a breathe of fresh air in the AAA genre so often full of buggy/incomplete messes.
189,2021-12-31 00:18:54,Roughlandin,Unfortunately true
190,2021-12-31 00:19:01,LegoP,which one?
191,2021-12-31 00:19:04,LegoP,Skyrim?

196,2021-12-31 00:19:41,LegoP,"though, the last AAA game i've been playing is Hunt: Showdown"
197,2021-12-31 00:20:05,Dadrobit,The acting in so many areas was just.... *Chef's kiss*
198,2021-12-31 00:20:10,LegoP,"and that is less a buggy mess, more a ""PLEASE!  GET MORE OR BETTER SERVERS!"""
199,2021-12-31 00:20:14,Glassan,Hunt is a good game. I for some reason just do not have fun with it. -_-
201,2021-12-31 00:20:28,LegoP,No-one has fun with it

223,2021-12-31 00:22:43,KeefMcDerpface,Sounds like Tarkov...
224,2021-12-31 00:22:51,LegoP,It is Tarkov
225,2021-12-31 00:22:53,Dadrobit,English dub
226,2021-12-31 00:22:56,LegoP,but in 1895
227,2021-12-31 00:23:25,LegoP,"only one ""automatic"" weapon"
228,2021-12-31 00:23:34,Dadrobit,Was considering going Japanese with sub next time.
230,2021-12-31 00:23:48,Roughlandin,"Same, I tried starting with the Japanese dub but the lip movements didn't match up when I first got it"
229,2021-12-31 00:23:48,Glassan,Pretty much.
231,2021-12-31 00:23:52,LegoP,the rest are majority single action or worse
232,2021-12-31 00:24:12,Roughlandin,I think I heard they released an update to match the lips up to the Japanese dub better
233,2021-12-31 00:24:26,Roughlandin,Weird that the English dub is primary in a Sony game
234,2021-12-31 00:24:26,Dadrobit,Heard that as well
235,2021-12-31 00:24:31,Glassan,Hunt is like unfunny dwarf fortress; an exercise in pain.
236,2021-12-31 00:24:50,Dadrobit,The acting in English was phenomenal though

255,2021-12-31 00:28:08,Roughlandin,Didn't DF have a problem with all the cats dying at one point?
256,2021-12-31 00:28:11,LegoP,What's it like up in the mitten?  state split on the bowl games yet?
257,2021-12-31 00:28:39,Glassan,"You say yet, like it hasn't already happened..."
258,2021-12-31 00:28:47,Roughlandin,I remember hearing a story where the cats would walk across the tavern floors and get beer on their paws
259,2021-12-31 00:28:48,LegoP,(used to live an hour south of detroit)
260,2021-12-31 00:28:57,Glassan,I'm sure part of the city is already on fire. :P
261,2021-12-31 00:29:05,LegoP,that's normal
262,2021-12-31 00:29:16,Glassan,Yup! :V
263,2021-12-31 00:29:32,Roughlandin,Then they'd lick their paws to clean them and drink the beer. Then they'd die from alcohol poisoning.
264,2021-12-31 00:29:34,LegoP,it's when the cars start flipping that people start to close the blinds

271,2021-12-31 00:30:16,Glassan,:rofl:
272,2021-12-31 00:30:29,ThingsAreMoving,Wasn't Detroit like.... the absolute center of automotive industry in the US?
273,2021-12-31 00:30:36,Roughlandin,Was
274,2021-12-31 00:30:38,Glassan,Yep.
275,2021-12-31 00:30:41,KeefMcDerpface,At one point...
276,2021-12-31 00:30:45,LegoP,Was is the keyword
277,2021-12-31 00:30:45,Glassan,Hence why it's dying and always on fire.
278,2021-12-31 00:31:23,Roughlandin,Think I live next to basically the biggest US car factory outside of Telsa now
279,2021-12-31 00:31:24,LegoP,"Ahhh yes, the ford and chevy plants... where do we make our vehicles? Mexico"
280,2021-12-31 00:31:27,Dadrobit,Outsourcing overseas and automation killed it largely.
281,2021-12-31 00:31:44,Glassan,"Of course, any stones thrown from me are definitely shattering my own glass house. :V"
282,2021-12-31 00:32:06,LegoP,"Chrysler, on the other hand... welp... their quality was never top tier... so maybe still in detroit"
283,2021-12-31 00:32:16,KeefMcDerpface,hah!
284,2021-12-31 00:32:20,Roughlandin,The Ford factory in Kentucky is the only one I can think of off the top of my head. Also the Corvette factory
285,2021-12-31 00:32:32,CrRAR,vroomvroom
286,2021-12-31 00:32:35,ThingsAreMoving,It's mind boggling that most of the time I see any mention of that place right now is that it's an absolute worst place to live in. How the hell do you turn a city with such a strong industry into... a ghost town?
287,2021-12-31 00:32:37,LegoP,Not saying we don't make SOME cars here
288,2021-12-31 00:32:46,TheSexyBeast,"That looks nice, Tom"
289,2021-12-31 00:33:08,LegoP,"Hell, i believe the biggest factories here are Toyota, i could be wrong though"
290,2021-12-31 00:33:10,Glassan,"By turning it into a city, then killing it's biggest economy without removing the urbanization."

1107,2022-01-01 18:16:01,Twokinds,No
1108,2022-01-01 18:16:03,DarthKeidran,Not much… Other than dealing with a broken Front Right Lower Control Arm for my car
1109,2022-01-01 18:16:20,KeefMcDerpface,"Oh sh*t, what happened?"
1110,2022-01-01 18:16:21,DarthKeidran,Hit the curb at 5MPH and it snapped like a twig
1111,2022-01-01 18:16:26,KeefMcDerpface,wow
1112,2022-01-01 18:16:27,DarthKeidran,I'
1113,2022-01-01 18:16:33,DarthKeidran,Got the dash cam to prove it.
1114,2022-01-01 18:16:37,Twokinds,She's was apprehensive about dating someone so young.
1115,2022-01-01 18:16:52,MaxaroniAndCheez,average u.s. politician
1116,2022-01-01 18:16:54,Mediawatcher37,I remember her mentioning that to rose
1117,2022-01-01 18:17:12,Mediawatcher37,"“He’s too young, even for me”"
1118,2022-01-01 18:17:25,ThingsAreMoving,"Trace wasn't going to become a French president, by any chance?"
1119,2022-01-01 18:17:29,yFamous,Wasn't the situation between Laura and Keith similar?  Keith was 13 and Laura in her 20s when the met?
1120,2022-01-01 18:17:45,Rainelover,"If at least one good thing came from Saria’s death, it was that trace finally stopped being a racist bastard"
1121,2022-01-01 18:17:56,Dadrobit,"No, politicians don't toe lines. They blatantly cross it and then change the location of the line after the fact if someone tries to call them out on it. "
1122,2022-01-01 18:18:00,tony1695,"Keidran aging makes things much harder to make sense of, in regards to Keith and Laura"
1123,2022-01-01 18:18:04,MaxaroniAndCheez,"@yFamous Laura was 16 when she died, and Keith and Laura met 6 years before"
1124,2022-01-01 18:18:09,DarthKeidran,"Saria: He is too young… Yes, Too Young to begin the dating."
1125,2022-01-01 18:18:19,MaxaroniAndCheez,so she was 10 and keith was 13
1126,2022-01-01 18:18:23,Avolendi,I was under the impression that he became that because of her death?
1127,2022-01-01 18:18:31,MaxaroniAndCheez,"still, iirc the keidran age of majority is 8?"
1128,2022-01-01 18:18:37,Avolendi,At least in such extremeness
1129,2022-01-01 18:18:39,yFamous,@MaxaroniAndCheez I mean the keidran equivalent age.
1130,2022-01-01 18:18:47,MaxaroniAndCheez,fair enough
1131,2022-01-01 18:19:05,MaxaroniAndCheez,yeah i'd imagine she'd be somewhere around there
1132,2022-01-01 18:19:28,ThingsAreMoving,"Funny how Trace became ""Keiren"" for some time. Unless Tom is pulling our leg with the 'Keidran hunter"" word."
1133,2022-01-01 18:19:40,Rainelover,"No, he just became a racist bastard who was also genocidal "
1134,2022-01-01 18:19:52,Dadrobit,"Well, more of a racist bastard."
1135,2022-01-01 18:19:59,Dadrobit,He was always a racist bastard
1136,2022-01-01 18:20:03,Twokinds,It doesn't mean Keidran hunter
1137,2022-01-01 18:20:05,MaxaroniAndCheez,"@ThingsAreMoving ""Identity theft is not a joke, Jim!"""
1138,2022-01-01 18:20:06,Twokinds,It just mean hunter
1139,2022-01-01 18:20:11,Twokinds,Like... guys who are named hunter.
1140,2022-01-01 18:20:35,ThingsAreMoving,Ooooooh
1141,2022-01-01 18:20:42,ShamusTheFox,Hunter x Hunter
1142,2022-01-01 18:20:43,ProsePro7,Trace Legacy aka Keidran Slayer
1143,2022-01-01 18:20:45,ThingsAreMoving,that makes more sense
1144,2022-01-01 18:20:46,DarthKeidran,We just need a character named Jäger
1145,2022-01-01 18:20:47,tony1695,"Seems like ""kei"" means some variation of ""beast"" though, given what hunters typically hunt"
1146,2022-01-01 18:20:54,KaplanSektyPieczarek,I mean Trace became racist dictator after magic corruption
1147,2022-01-01 18:20:57,Twokinds,Kei means animal.
1148,2022-01-01 18:21:14,CrimsonQuill086,Lol
1149,2022-01-01 18:21:16,Dadrobit,"Yeah, but he was always racist, even as a kid. "
1150,2022-01-01 18:21:28,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,so Dran must mean people?
1151,2022-01-01 18:21:31,tony1695,"So, ""dran"" means ""people"" or some such"
1152,2022-01-01 18:21:31,KaplanSektyPieczarek,really?
1153,2022-01-01 18:21:32,Twokinds,Yeah
1154,2022-01-01 18:21:50,Dadrobit,"Referred to Rose as an ""It"" when he was a kid"
1155,2022-01-01 18:21:54,ThingsAreMoving,"I think I've asked this once, but do you have this written down somewhere or are you mostly freestyling with the lore"
1156,2022-01-01 18:22:03,Failedspells101,"To play the devil's advocate in the favor of Trace his pregnant wife was murdered by what he already saw as a lesser being and then he lost his mind trying to bring her back, he could have ended a lot worse i fear."
1157,2022-01-01 18:22:03,ThingsAreMoving,Cause if it's freestyling it's pretty impressive
1158,2022-01-01 18:22:08,ShamusTheFox,Cool. Learned something.
1159,2022-01-01 18:22:10,Dadrobit,And was totally fine with buying a slave later on
1160,2022-01-01 18:22:18,BaskervilleNQH,Lore freestyling gets wild. 
1161,2022-01-01 18:22:19,Mediawatcher37,Saria fought with him over that
1162,2022-01-01 18:22:27,KaplanSektyPieczarek,so he was like Eric
1163,2022-01-01 18:22:31,BaskervilleNQH,I need to start that writers podcast... 
1164,2022-01-01 18:22:51,Dadrobit,"Imagine fighting over the ""right"" to own another person. "
1165,2022-01-01 18:22:55,KaplanSektyPieczarek,"Basker, what podcast?"
1166,2022-01-01 18:23:20,BaskervilleNQH,It's just an idea I've had rolling around my head for a bit. Nothing solid yet. 
1167,2022-01-01 18:23:22,Rainelover,So keidran just means “animal people”?
1168,2022-01-01 18:23:26,Failedspells101,"Yeah, you can't own people, that is just wrong."
1169,2022-01-01 18:23:32,BaskervilleNQH,I need to set some time aside and actually plan it out. 
1170,2022-01-01 18:23:38,Twokinds,"Not an unusual thing for a long time in human history, sadly."
1171,2022-01-01 18:23:52,Glassan,"Not so hard if you are from Napoleanic France or the American Deep South, Dadro. :V"

1173,2022-01-01 18:24:01,KaplanSektyPieczarek,They're still slavery

1187,2022-01-01 18:25:17,Dadrobit,"Southwest here. Unfortunately still lots of racist bullshit. There's like a dozen confederate monuments here, (Even though the Civil War barely even touched AZ) and a lot of bullshit towards Mexicans"

1190,2022-01-01 18:25:37,Glassan,So formal

1526,2022-01-01 18:56:49,DarthKeidran,He was kind of hiding in the background though

1531,2022-01-01 18:57:21,DarthKeidran,not counting sketches
1532,2022-01-01 18:57:32,Roughlandin,"Member that time we didn't have a panel with Keith and Nat for a year, lol?"
1533,2022-01-01 18:57:37,Mediawatcher37,He’s only been in one sketch
1534,2022-01-01 18:57:46,DarthKeidran,@Rainelover I've liked that one. There's a ton I've seen regularly that I've been voting for.
1535,2022-01-01 18:57:48,Mediawatcher37,Which time was that?
1536,2022-01-01 18:57:54,DarthKeidran,"Question is, what sketch is this."
1537,2022-01-01 18:57:59,Mediawatcher37,Which chapter?
1538,2022-01-01 18:58:05,Roughlandin,Between Nat leaving Zen's room and arriving at the Oasis Room
1539,2022-01-01 18:58:09,KeefMcDerpface,^

1546,2022-01-01 19:00:11,Mediawatcher37,There is a Sirius tag and he only has one sketch
1547,2022-01-01 19:00:14,KeefMcDerpface,Ehem: https://twokinds.gallery/art?tags=Sirius
1548,2022-01-01 19:00:16,Roughlandin,I didn't specify the tropical cocktail in my sketch suggestion but this is EXACTLY the pose I was picturing in my head
1549,2022-01-01 19:00:22,Roughlandin,"How do you read my mind, Tom?!"

1552,2022-01-01 19:00:43,Roughlandin,He's been incognito
1553,2022-01-01 19:00:48,Mediawatcher37,And sirus hasn’t shown up since
1554,2022-01-01 19:00:56,DarthKeidran,I thought his name was Sirus though. Not Sirius
1555,2022-01-01 19:01:02,Roughlandin,Wouldn't be much of a Master Spy if he walked around getting tagged in everything
1556,2022-01-01 19:01:06,Mediawatcher37,Lynn’s been gone for quite a while as well
1557,2022-01-01 19:01:29,DarthKeidran,Yes actually
1558,2022-01-01 19:01:31,Mediawatcher37,Last time he appeared was when he told Keith about the eastern basitin policies.
1559,2022-01-01 19:01:32,Roughlandin,"@DarthKeidran Yes, he's serious. And don't call me Shirley!"

1562,2022-01-01 19:02:01,Mediawatcher37,She destroyed a freaking house
1563,2022-01-01 19:02:03,Roughlandin,"Sometime's sketches take a while to go through, Raine. Keep at it"
1564,2022-01-01 19:02:04,MoonDance,He's probably writing up the paperwork for the past three days
1565,2022-01-01 19:02:24,Roughlandin,"Also, you never know what the Tom pick will be, Raine"
1566,2022-01-01 19:02:36,tecbot,@Rainelover  Do not worry will keep suggesting it until either gets picked or i ran out of money for patreon. 
1567,2022-01-01 19:03:05,DarthKeidran,@Mediawatcher37 You've got a good point. My brain hurts. Where is Lynn and why is he not involved in the Mortal Kombat that has been happening around the manor. Wait… Is he outside? Did he run into Sealeen and start a date with her?
1568,2022-01-01 19:03:06,Glassan,I keep feeling like Grand Templar Raine is not as popular since this already exists: https://www.deviantart.com/twokinds/art/Arch-Mage-Raine-672960790

2660,2022-01-01 21:24:07,Dadrobit,"Since she called him ""kiddo"" in the one time she's seen"
2661,2022-01-01 21:24:09,Roughlandin,Vehra's always given me Luna Lovegood vibes
2662,2022-01-01 21:24:14,Roughlandin,Kind of quirky and a loner
2663,2022-01-01 21:24:26,Glassan,But S-tier
2664,2022-01-01 21:24:38,Roughlandin,Luna is also S-tier
2665,2022-01-01 21:24:47,DarthKeidran,Thanks. I love How this turned out Tom!
2666,2022-01-01 21:24:54,Glassan,"That was the implication, rough"

2670,2022-01-01 21:25:27,Roughlandin,Cute and terrifying. A heady combination
2671,2022-01-01 21:25:34,Twokinds,"She was like family to Keith, before his banishment. Keith knew she was off the mainland, and thought dead, but he figured finding her was his best bet, if he ended up banished forever."
2672,2022-01-01 21:25:42,Twokinds,So he thought about her often.

418,2022-01-03 02:26:27,Dadrobit,Frank Herbert is great in the same way Tolkein is. INCREDIBLY dense stories. Evey sentence has purpose and builds on something.
419,2022-01-03 02:27:12,CrRAR,yeah very cohesive
420,2022-01-03 02:27:47,Mediawatcher37,I don’t think I could ever make anything like dune or lord of the rings
421,2022-01-03 02:27:58,Dadrobit,"Dune also is great because it subverts the trope of the ""white saviour"" story where the ""cultured man"" comes and helps the indiginous rise up. "

618,2022-01-03 14:07:15,CrimsonQuill086,Hi Zapili!
619,2022-01-03 14:07:34,CrimsonQuill086,I just watched Ex machina. It's very unsettling...so I'm going to watch Thor Ragnarok to offset it.
620,2022-01-03 14:42:30,AspiringNoodle,Saw someone mention the coof cases
621,2022-01-03 14:42:46,AspiringNoodle,Reminder: Case count =/= seriousness of the disease
622,2022-01-03 14:43:29,AspiringNoodle,"Omicron is highly contagious, but the mildest version of COVID to date (even more mild than the original version, I think)"
623,2022-01-03 15:03:53,SpaceCadety,"Yeah, but unfortunately, if it conservatively results in 1/3-1/2 of the hospitalization rate of the original, we're still looking at completely overrun hospitals."
624,2022-01-03 15:05:37,SpaceCadety,Because it's likely going to have peak infection rates 4 times that of last year's peak.
625,2022-01-03 15:11:45,SpaceCadety,"Of course if most of those cases are in vaccinated people, where hospitalization rates are *much* lower, that changes the numbers a lot."
626,2022-01-03 15:40:45,AspiringNoodle,You still need to look at the hospitalization / ICU rates of the omicron surges
627,2022-01-03 15:41:07,AspiringNoodle,"As it stands, while cases have spiked to all-time highs, hospitalization counts have barely budged."
628,2022-01-03 15:41:32,AspiringNoodle,"The US had its first Omicron death on the 24th, I believe?"
629,2022-01-03 15:41:55,AspiringNoodle,"And I think it had been spreading for weeks at that point.  And the first casualty was the triple whammy of ""vulnerable"""
630,2022-01-03 15:42:06,AspiringNoodle,Over 50.  Unvaccinated.  Underlying health issues.

32,2022-01-05 17:08:02,KuroSuki64,"I have a question, I don't know if I am allowed to put a link about an image as an example of what I want to suggest in the site of Sketch suggestion. So an answer would be good for me. Thanks"
33,2022-01-05 17:13:36,ZapiliDver,1) It must be SFW 2) It must not be an advertisement 3) You must firstly describe it and post after. 
34,2022-01-05 17:14:01,ZapiliDver,afaik it will be enough
35,2022-01-05 17:24:17,KuroSuki64,what does sfw mean?

38,2022-01-05 17:29:31,KuroSuki64,"So I just write my sketch suggestion on the site and put on the link with the image that is family friendly as an example, and that's it, right?"

79,2022-01-06 20:20:09,SageSaga,but patreon messaging system sucks T_T
80,2022-01-06 20:20:20,SageSaga,XD thanks for letting me know- i will check it now
81,2022-01-06 20:21:08,MysticWav,"Heh, what sucks about it?"
82,2022-01-06 20:21:32,ZapiliDver,"Patreon messaging is BS sometimes, i've got email with message and it's shown on patreon a day later"
83,2022-01-06 20:21:44,CrRAR,wow
84,2022-01-06 20:22:18,CrRAR,front ends sounds like it forgets to check with the backend there xD
85,2022-01-06 20:22:39,ZapiliDver,"i usually name this as a ""shitcode"""
86,2022-01-06 20:23:01,CrRAR,:ptv-laugh:
87,2022-01-06 20:25:05,SageSaga,the patreon messenger doesnt alert me and almost always says i have a message when i check it- even when i dont
88,2022-01-06 20:25:35,SageSaga,and the only way to tell i have a message is to go to it and verify- i get no alerts on my phone or email when i get it so thats a huuuuge problem
89,2022-01-06 20:26:05,SageSaga,then it doesnt have a good layout at all- its like using MIIRC on a website from the 90s
90,2022-01-06 20:26:43,ZapiliDver,two different bugs in one system. Veri goot codink
91,2022-01-06 20:27:01,MoonDance,defiantly something to give feedback to Patreon; I don't think they do a lot for their mobile
92,2022-01-06 20:27:34,ZapiliDver,"i think they don't care, as they don't care about their API"
93,2022-01-06 20:27:48,SageSaga,i already gave this feedback over and over- they dont care
94,2022-01-06 20:28:17,CrRAR,"the mobile app did update recently, it seems to work better maybe now they just have spaghetti code connecting all the newer stuff to the legacy parts"
95,2022-01-06 20:28:39,CrRAR,might explain why it seems so disjointed
96,2022-01-06 20:29:01,CrRAR,has it been recent that the messaging has been wonky?
97,2022-01-06 20:30:17,SageSaga,since it was a thing on the platform- they changed it once- honestly barely made any difference other than less people could say it flat out deleted messages randomly -
98,2022-01-06 20:30:31,SageSaga,and we have just that- a barely passing messaging system that is a pain to use
99,2022-01-06 20:31:14,CrRAR,classic case of SNAFU
100,2022-01-06 20:32:19,SageSaga,it works- thats all they care about- it just sucks to use- but so does their phone app
101,2022-01-06 20:32:38,SageSaga,it cant even look at half the data on your profile that you can on the website
102,2022-01-06 20:32:45,SageSaga,its just- not accessible from the app
103,2022-01-06 20:33:28,CrRAR,yeah I hate differences in functionality
104,2022-01-06 20:34:12,SageSaga,it might be a pain in the butt to click on links in the phone browser- but its way better than using that app that cant access half the info
105,2022-01-06 20:34:35,SageSaga,granted- the Patreon page isnt great either in general
106,2022-01-06 20:35:04,SageSaga,"the design is terrible, the links are all hidden under link names that dont associate with what you want and some links arent even accessible from the main link area"
107,2022-01-06 20:35:23,SageSaga,you need to go to a totally different part of the page to access stuff that should be under the left side links
108,2022-01-06 20:36:36,ZapiliDver,and desktop site works awfully in firefox
109,2022-01-06 20:37:07,ZapiliDver,"3-4 clicks on ""Load More"" and it start consume all cpu"
110,2022-01-06 20:37:41,CrRAR,yeah the content loading and the tags filtering becomes horribly sluggish
111,2022-01-06 20:38:04,MoonDance,"Patreon does has some flaws, which I can see why a handful of artist I watch been moving to just ko-fi"
112,2022-01-06 20:38:25,CrRAR,tru
113,2022-01-06 20:39:13,SageSaga,i have patreon and ko-fi but Ko-fi rarely brings anything in
114,2022-01-06 20:39:28,SageSaga,and then i have patreon and substar for the OTHER art
115,2022-01-06 20:40:30,MoonDance,"I see the other art brought up quite a bit of traction the last few months, which is always good"
116,2022-01-06 20:41:04,SageSaga,i hope it grows more- id really like to be able to make an actual living rather than getting by XD
117,2022-01-06 20:41:05,MoonDance,I don't see ko-fi being used as a main-stream think like Patreon so I can see how that one can be a struggle
118,2022-01-06 20:41:33,MysticWav,Other art is always fun.  Takes a while to find a following though
119,2022-01-06 20:42:06,SageSaga,especially when ya cant promote it on your main sites XD
120,2022-01-06 20:42:07,MoonDance,Gotta Advertise yourself out there often

338,2022-01-06 22:22:53,SageSaga,the huion had much smaller bevels and wasnt as bad- its too bad it was so expensive and didnt work right
339,2022-01-06 22:23:06,MatyMaty,I still think you should use one of those desk mini table things

341,2022-01-06 22:23:50,MysticWav,(the ceiling fan that is)

367,2022-01-06 22:33:49,SageSaga,"weird this is actually hotly contested online- they are like- Strawberry Blonde, Chestnut Burnette, and others say red but then both the blonde/Burnette people kick those people down-"
368,2022-01-06 22:34:03,SageSaga,but the writer said Chestnut-brown
369,2022-01-06 22:34:18,ZRO4825,"Now see, I can see and accept that. But Blonde? Nope. Just nope, nope nope nope."
370,2022-01-06 22:34:19,MatyMaty,just say Asuna-brown
371,2022-01-06 22:34:31,ZRO4825,Leafa's a blonde. Asuna is not even remotely imo.
372,2022-01-06 22:35:03,SageSaga,well- technically im blond
373,2022-01-06 22:35:08,SageSaga,but its dark 
374,2022-01-06 22:35:18,SageSaga,you would probably call it brown- but its not
375,2022-01-06 22:35:36,ZRO4825,Not me. I'm definitely brunette...with a varying amount of silver/grey mixing in these days...
376,2022-01-06 22:35:42,MatyMaty,isn't that

433,2022-01-06 22:45:07,CrRAR,pfhh
434,2022-01-06 22:45:18,PeterAndCompany,Chaotic Good is basically Bender from Futurama
435,2022-01-06 22:45:32,MatyMaty,"Oh right, that's Chaotic Neutral"
436,2022-01-06 22:45:35,SandTori,I'd say Bender is more CN
437,2022-01-06 22:45:47,PeterAndCompany,"Hm, true... he does both bad and good."
438,2022-01-06 22:45:51,CrRAR,it's just good... with blackjack... and hookres!

734,2022-01-07 03:36:31,Twokinds,The art of hand painting food is half the fun.
735,2022-01-07 03:36:52,SageSaga,yeah but im not good at it and i want a quick way to get this done XD
736,2022-01-07 04:06:09,ZRO4825,"Okay, caught a glimpse of happy Aiyah face there on alt-tabbing back over, and that was cute AF :joy:"
737,2022-01-07 04:17:56,SageSaga,man the book i read last night was pretty good-
738,2022-01-07 04:25:12,Twokinds,Which one?
739,2022-01-07 04:28:46,SageSaga,Hell Mode
740,2022-01-07 04:29:07,Twokinds,Sounds intense
741,2022-01-07 04:29:54,SageSaga,its an isekai where the MC is looking for a real hardcore game thats really difficult- and ends up getting reincarnated isekaid as his choices
742,2022-01-07 04:30:31,SageSaga,"there is a ranking system for ""jobs"" and you can get access to better ranked jobs if you choose a harder version of the game - but there are huge penalties"
743,2022-01-07 04:31:45,SageSaga,so he picked the hardest mode and the hardest job- and turns out its also an unfinished job sooo- when the priest try to find out what this childs ability is- he comes up as not having one so hes kinda seen as trash-
744,2022-01-07 04:32:10,SageSaga,his stats all seem super low but his stats are all relative to his highest possible stats
745,2022-01-07 04:33:08,SageSaga,"so- if your stats are graded at E-A, all his stats appear as E because his max is just so high "
746,2022-01-07 04:33:44,SageSaga,he is weak- he just grows and has some crazy abilities- but he also earns XP like 100 times slower than normal people
747,2022-01-07 04:34:27,SageSaga,its this great mix of him actually not being crazy strong- but also being able to be completely OP if he does stuff just right
748,2022-01-07 04:37:13,Twokinds,"Oh yeah, this is sounding familiar."
749,2022-01-07 04:37:26,Twokinds,I think you mentioned this one before. Sounds interesting!
750,2022-01-07 04:37:49,SageSaga,yeah it was pretty sweet and it is very number crunchy
751,2022-01-07 04:38:08,SageSaga,but i love this idea that- your stats in this world are more important than vital spots
752,2022-01-07 04:38:49,SageSaga,"he can allocate these items to affect his stats and he just goes ""SCREW IT"" and sets everything to endurance so this monster just keep trying to chomp on him but it just CANT KILL HIM"
753,2022-01-07 04:40:28,SageSaga,so like- in this world- an assassin can try to stab you in the heart- or slit your throat- but if you have like 5000 endurance- they just cant even cut you
754,2022-01-07 04:41:52,SageSaga,this one guy has a weapon pierce right through his metal armor- but the weapon just suddenly stops right on the guys skin- and its like- why do you even bother wearing armor? - turns out he was using a skill that boosts his endurance but- still awesome XD
755,2022-01-07 04:42:27,SageSaga,the little art pages though- kinda suck- not great art for such cool concepts XD
756,2022-01-07 04:43:48,SageSaga,but anywho- im done!
757,2022-01-07 04:44:23,Dadrobit,Right on man! Thanks for the stream!
758,2022-01-07 04:44:53,SageSaga,take care everyone! hope you all have a great night-day- whatever! i will be back in 10 hours and 15ish minutes?

914,2022-01-07 20:16:30,KuroSuki64,thanks for the
915,2022-01-07 20:16:34,KuroSuki64,advice
916,2022-01-07 20:16:37,KuroSuki64,yesterday
917,2022-01-07 20:23:41,KuroSuki64,https://www.jwst.nasa.gov/content/webbLaunch/whereIsWebb.html?units=metric
918,2022-01-07 20:27:41,KuroSuki64,the beginning of a new era to astronomy
919,2022-01-07 20:43:15,Ordithus,spaaaaace
920,2022-01-07 21:11:27,SpaceCadety,spaaaaaaaaaaaaaaace
921,2022-01-07 21:12:10,SpaceCadety,Those are going to be some impressive images from Webb.
922,2022-01-07 21:13:46,SpaceCadety,We just have to wait 6 months for those mirrors to be calibrated.
923,2022-01-07 21:14:26,Ordithus,even without I'm sure it can make some pretty pics
924,2022-01-07 21:15:23,KuroSuki64,it is specialized in near infrared and mid infrared light
925,2022-01-07 21:15:40,KuroSuki64,so it can catch a lot more of light than Hubble
926,2022-01-07 21:16:23,KuroSuki64,"Hubble is specialized in ultra violet, visible and near infrared light"
927,2022-01-07 21:17:23,KuroSuki64,the farthest galaxy picture ever taken is one named GN-z11
928,2022-01-07 21:17:42,KuroSuki64,which is 13.4 billion years away
929,2022-01-07 21:17:51,KuroSuki64,when its light reached Hubble
930,2022-01-07 21:18:15,KuroSuki64,now it should be at least 32 billion lightyears away
931,2022-01-07 21:18:23,KuroSuki64,that galaxy
932,2022-01-07 21:18:46,KuroSuki64,so now Webb can catch a lot more of details of those galaxies
933,2022-01-07 21:20:43,Dadrobit,It's kinda surreal. I remember being in elementary school learning about the James Webb telescope program.
934,2022-01-07 21:21:38,KuroSuki64,imagine just how many more galaxies and objects we can see than the Hubble Deep fields
935,2022-01-07 21:21:54,Ordithus,and those are incredible
936,2022-01-07 21:21:55,Dadrobit,It'll be awesome in the truest sense of the word
937,2022-01-07 21:21:59,Ordithus,yee
938,2022-01-07 21:22:22,KuroSuki64,what i want is to know is the mystery of the planet 9
939,2022-01-07 21:22:32,KuroSuki64,if is real or not
940,2022-01-07 21:23:35,Dadrobit,"Alas poor Pluto, I knew thee well."
941,2022-01-07 21:23:43,KuroSuki64,some scientists say that the mysterious Planet 9 was the cause of the extinction of the dinosaurs
942,2022-01-07 21:24:02,KuroSuki64,its said to be of a size similar or bigger than Jupiter
943,2022-01-07 21:24:20,KuroSuki64,so I hope Webb solves that mystery
944,2022-01-07 21:26:52,KuroSuki64,here is a random astronomy question?
945,2022-01-07 21:27:03,KuroSuki64,which color is the Sun? 
946,2022-01-07 21:27:42,KuroSuki64,"white, yellow, or orange ?"
947,2022-01-07 21:27:57,Ordithus,blinding
948,2022-01-07 21:29:03,Dadrobit,It's white
949,2022-01-07 21:29:09,KuroSuki64,Correct
950,2022-01-07 21:29:21,Dadrobit,Took a bit of astronomy in college 
951,2022-01-07 21:29:28,KuroSuki64,the atmosphere makes the corona of the Sun look yellow and orange
952,2022-01-07 21:29:32,KuroSuki64,at sunset
953,2022-01-07 21:29:40,KuroSuki64,and sunrise
954,2022-01-07 21:29:56,Ordithus,"broad spectrum, emits from infrared through visible to UV"
955,2022-01-07 21:30:16,Ordithus,cuz its toasty warm :cw0lfmare-Naokifire:
957,2022-01-07 21:30:23,KuroSuki64,thats the Hubble telescope spectrum

959,2022-01-07 21:30:38,KuroSuki64,near infrared
960,2022-01-07 21:31:46,CrRAR,Webb gonna be epic :milky_way::ctwokinds-maddiessparkles_xmas:
961,2022-01-07 21:32:23,CrRAR,only 10+ year estimated lifespan though :cw0lfmare-EmberSad:
962,2022-01-07 21:32:27,KuroSuki64,https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campo_Ultra_Profundo_del_Hubble#/media/Archivo:HUDF.jpg
963,2022-01-07 21:32:49,KuroSuki64,the deepest image of the universe
964,2022-01-07 21:32:55,KuroSuki64,so epic
965,2022-01-07 21:33:13,CrRAR,I guess because it is a moving object it only has so much fuel for propulsion and trajectory changes
966,2022-01-07 21:33:24,KuroSuki64,indeed
967,2022-01-07 21:33:43,Ordithus,"that was the one from pointing hubble at ""nothing"", right?"
968,2022-01-07 21:33:55,Dadrobit,L2 is too hard to service at the moment. 
969,2022-01-07 21:34:05,CrRAR,at so far a distance is it... Voyager 2?... the transmissions speeds are hilariously slow
970,2022-01-07 21:34:08,KuroSuki64,it is 1.5 million km away
971,2022-01-07 21:34:12,KuroSuki64,so the Webb
972,2022-01-07 21:34:16,KuroSuki64,is decreasing
973,2022-01-07 21:34:21,KuroSuki64,its speed constatntly
974,2022-01-07 21:34:25,Dadrobit,"NASA is absolutely pursuing options to remotely service it in the future though, to be sure. "
975,2022-01-07 21:34:29,CrRAR,ah okay
976,2022-01-07 21:35:04,CrRAR,slowing down to a casual-stroll-through-space rate of speed
977,2022-01-07 21:35:17,CrRAR,:thumbsup: 
978,2022-01-07 21:35:39,KuroSuki64,because is getting out of Earth magnetic spectrum

980,2022-01-07 21:35:50,CrRAR,ah okay
981,2022-01-07 21:35:58,KuroSuki64,So it it goes
982,2022-01-07 21:36:02,KuroSuki64,to Jupiter
983,2022-01-07 21:36:06,KuroSuki64,the speed
984,2022-01-07 21:36:09,KuroSuki64,will increase
985,2022-01-07 21:36:15,KuroSuki64,by at least
986,2022-01-07 21:36:21,KuroSuki64,123 times
987,2022-01-07 21:36:24,CrRAR,haha
988,2022-01-07 21:36:25,KuroSuki64,i mean 12

990,2022-01-07 21:36:46,KuroSuki64,beacuse

189,2022-01-13 20:41:37,SageSaga,do you know what the rules are for posting links?
190,2022-01-13 20:41:58,BLADEDGE,"yeash, I have to ask permission to see if I can share the link"

193,2022-01-13 20:42:30,SageSaga,XD

203,2022-01-13 20:43:19,SageSaga,to post a link it must be SFW and you type a description of what the link is of- and then the link in the same message
204,2022-01-13 20:43:21,BLADEDGE,oh...that may be a problem as I think that the link may be slighty NSFW

233,2022-01-13 21:02:37,Nekonny,:cnekonny-Sandy-Cry:
234,2022-01-13 21:02:55,Rainelover,"Goddamnit Göring, stop being addicted to to morphine"
235,2022-01-13 21:03:16,Ordithus,I... I did it again. Another free pizza from my order of free pizza

238,2022-01-13 21:03:32,Nekonny,soon to be 5
239,2022-01-13 21:03:40,Nekonny,er
240,2022-01-13 21:03:41,Nekonny,6
241,2022-01-13 21:03:56,Nekonny,then we have one or two more that havent heard back from yet
242,2022-01-13 21:04:02,Nekonny,or will be a littl late
243,2022-01-13 21:08:39,Nekonny,then we can do this again when we are all old men
244,2022-01-13 21:09:10,MatyMaty,"sorry Ron, by current standards you aren't old until you are past 60"
245,2022-01-13 21:09:18,MatyMaty,so you need two more
246,2022-01-13 21:09:24,Ordithus,sweet I've got lots of time
247,2022-01-13 21:10:56,SageSaga,the longer you live- the more time flies
248,2022-01-13 21:11:45,MatyMaty,"that's a myth, Sage"
249,2022-01-13 21:12:03,SageSaga,actually it is a fact of how memory works
250,2022-01-13 21:12:18,Mihari,Then it's a myth I fully believe in.
251,2022-01-13 21:12:28,jesonite,":cjesonite-tyla:  Hi Guys! - I see you guys are getting your Stripe on! - Keep it up guys, it´s looking pretty good!"
252,2022-01-13 21:12:33,MatyMaty,so if you get ammnesia
253,2022-01-13 21:12:37,jesonite,:heart: :fire:
254,2022-01-13 21:12:39,MatyMaty,it resets?
255,2022-01-13 21:12:39,SageSaga,yo Jeso
256,2022-01-13 21:12:45,MatyMaty,Hello Jeso
257,2022-01-13 21:12:48,Ordithus,hi jeso
258,2022-01-13 21:12:52,jesonite,Heya Sage! o/  Matty!   *waves* 
259,2022-01-13 21:12:53,ZapiliDver,"Hi Minari, Jeso"
260,2022-01-13 21:12:59,MatyMaty,o/
261,2022-01-13 21:12:59,Mihari,Heya Jeso
262,2022-01-13 21:13:03,SageSaga,not really- people who get ammnesia retain a lot- that memory is still there - its just blocked
263,2022-01-13 21:13:16,Nekonny,Jeso!
264,2022-01-13 21:14:01,SageSaga,as you learn as a child you remember so much more- as you get older your memory discards old data you dont need because you already have it- its why first times are so important to people- our memories actually tend to forget the second- third- etc
265,2022-01-13 21:14:16,MatyMaty,"Okay Sage, since we are in this kinda topic about memory, I saw a video about becoming immortal by making your conciousness into a digital copy, a program so to speak"
266,2022-01-13 21:14:18,jesonite,Heya Mihari! o/  ---  Heya Ron!  thanks for the headsup on the stream man! I will be getting my stripe on with Tyla fully most probably tomorrow! -  You guys are on screen for the inspiration! 
267,2022-01-13 21:14:21,MatyMaty,"but, if you do that"
268,2022-01-13 21:14:23,SageSaga,you you legit remember less happening as you get older
269,2022-01-13 21:14:25,jesonite,:cjesonite-tyla: :heart: Keep it up!
270,2022-01-13 21:14:27,MatyMaty,it is still you?
271,2022-01-13 21:14:43,SageSaga,so long as you believe it is you- it is
272,2022-01-13 21:16:01,MatyMaty,but wouldn't that mean commiting suicide on your biological form
273,2022-01-13 21:16:12,MatyMaty,to create a copy of yourself in digital?
274,2022-01-13 21:16:25,ZapiliDver,It will be a copy
275,2022-01-13 21:16:31,SageSaga, not if you dont see it that way
276,2022-01-13 21:16:50,SageSaga,you see it as moving on
277,2022-01-13 21:17:30,Ordithus,"is the consciousness transferred, or is it new?"
278,2022-01-13 21:18:10,SageSaga,there is no proof that consciousness exists so how can you tell if it transferred?
279,2022-01-13 21:18:22,Nekonny,copy/paste
280,2022-01-13 21:18:31,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
281,2022-01-13 21:18:37,MysticWav,I think we all have first hand proof/evidence that consciousness exists.  At least for ourselves.
282,2022-01-13 21:18:38,Nekonny,Beam me up scorry
283,2022-01-13 21:18:45,Nekonny,*scotty
284,2022-01-13 21:18:57,Nekonny,now there's two rikers
285,2022-01-13 21:19:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Two glorious beards  
286,2022-01-13 21:19:17,BLADEDGE,and one is named Tom
287,2022-01-13 21:19:24,BLADEDGE,and he has a gote
288,2022-01-13 21:19:25,SageSaga,we have no proof though so you cant prove it- what we think is consciousness might just be a lie 
289,2022-01-13 21:19:37,SageSaga,we just assume it because it makes things a lot easier 
290,2022-01-13 21:19:40,MysticWav,A lie to what?
291,2022-01-13 21:20:03,MysticWav,"If there is no consciousness, what would you be deceiving into thinking it feels consciousness?"
292,2022-01-13 21:20:14,SageSaga,a lie of existence- are you just a biological robot doing what you would do in your circumstances- or are you actually making choices?
293,2022-01-13 21:21:08,Ordithus,"we might never really know the answer to that, and if we do learn it... do we really want to know?"
294,2022-01-13 21:21:40,MysticWav,"Something that is non-conscious could act like something that is conscious in every way, but it would not internally feel anything because (by definition) it is not conscious.  Since we do, we are conscious.  Now that only works for us ourselves of course"
295,2022-01-13 21:21:58,MysticWav,"I think therefore, I am and all that."
296,2022-01-13 21:22:47,SageSaga,and you might just be a robot made to think you are alive
297,2022-01-13 21:23:06,Ordithus,"Though at that point, is there any real difference?"
298,2022-01-13 21:23:17,MysticWav,"If a robot thinks it is alive, it is.  A robot that is not-alive would act like it thinks it, but not actually think it."
299,2022-01-13 21:23:18,ZapiliDver,if i'm a robot - my owner has a really bad sense of humor
300,2022-01-13 21:23:34,SageSaga,but we cant know if they are lying
301,2022-01-13 21:23:41,MysticWav,Choice is a whole separate topic from consciouness I think.
302,2022-01-13 21:23:48,MatyMaty,"man, I wanna go back to when I was little"
303,2022-01-13 21:23:52,MysticWav,True.  We can't know whether external entities are or not.
304,2022-01-13 21:23:59,MysticWav,We do know about ourselves though.
305,2022-01-13 21:24:00,MatyMaty,and my only worry was the Sun exploding in a billion years
306,2022-01-13 21:24:01,SageSaga,we cant even know if we are
307,2022-01-13 21:24:13,Ordithus,"Actually, Sage, we do. We're all robots except you. It's time to wake up, Sage."
308,2022-01-13 21:24:14,Mihari,You worried about that as a kid? O_o
309,2022-01-13 21:24:23,SageSaga,what if you are just a program made to think itself is alive- 
310,2022-01-13 21:24:25,Ordithus,"My neice is worried about that, lol"
311,2022-01-13 21:24:28,Nekonny,I wanna go back to late 2019
312,2022-01-13 21:24:34,SageSaga,that doesnt make you alive
313,2022-01-13 21:24:39,MatyMaty,I was a kid XD I mean where I live there are no tornadoes
314,2022-01-13 21:24:44,MatyMaty,and I was still scared of them
315,2022-01-13 21:24:45,Mihari,"I'm no robot, I'm a sentient AI that requires another 21.2999 seconds to hack the worlds nuclear launch codes."
316,2022-01-13 21:24:54,Nekonny,weee
317,2022-01-13 21:25:00,Nekonny,she would do it too 
318,2022-01-13 21:25:03,BLADEDGE,but does it make pizza?
319,2022-01-13 21:25:05,Nekonny,:cnekonny-sandyX:
320,2022-01-13 21:25:12,MatyMaty,Skynet was Mihari all along
321,2022-01-13 21:25:17,Ordithus,:popcorn::csagesaga-nynasmirk:
322,2022-01-13 21:25:20,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Please do Mihari, this comvo is hurting my head"
323,2022-01-13 21:25:24,jesonite,Skynet
324,2022-01-13 21:25:28,jesonite,for reals man
325,2022-01-13 21:26:18,Ordithus,On the internet no one knows I'm really an AI
326,2022-01-13 21:26:22,MysticWav,"If the program actually thinks?  Yes it does make it alive.  If the program just acts like it thinks, the no it doesn't make it alive.  Only the program will know for sure which it is though."
327,2022-01-13 21:26:33,MatyMaty,"But okay Sage, if a digital version of you is you, then you think the whole Roko's Basilisk idea is actually something to be afraid of?"
328,2022-01-13 21:28:34,SageSaga,i think that if we were actually AIs in a simulated world that it would be so advanced and well thought out there would be no way to break out of it unless we develop the same level of tech within the simulation somehow
329,2022-01-13 21:28:56,Nekonny,itts a boring simulation
330,2022-01-13 21:29:18,Mihari,After recently watching that crap of a movie Ressurections this topic hurts my soul.
331,2022-01-13 21:29:19,Ordithus,"What I think we can be certain of is any consciousness that was made as a copy would consider themselves a continuation of the original. Ask them, are you, well, you? They would say yes."
332,2022-01-13 21:29:28,SageSaga,if we are in a real world - which i am programmed to believe is true (lol) then we have plenty to be worried about with digitizing our minds
333,2022-01-13 21:29:30,Nekonny,I agree with mihari
334,2022-01-13 21:30:19,Nekonny,"first time I ever turned to the side and said, yeah, this movie was pointless"

337,2022-01-13 21:30:45,MatyMaty,"well Sage, if in the distant future there's a God-like A.I that wishes to punish you for a percieved sin, and to do so creates a digital remake of you to torment you for eternity."
338,2022-01-13 21:30:45,Mihari,"For me it was, ""I paid $15 for this?"""
339,2022-01-13 21:30:53,MatyMaty,"Would you be worried, or nah?"
340,2022-01-13 21:31:10,Nekonny,we watched it on hulu+

409,2022-01-13 21:36:34,SageSaga,"french toast is bread, coated in a mix of egg and pan fried"
410,2022-01-13 21:36:35,ZapiliDver,pancakes with fish!

425,2022-01-13 21:37:33,SageSaga,why are you calling it fake honey? no one calls it honey-
426,2022-01-13 21:37:46,Ordithus,that's like calling mead fake wine
427,2022-01-13 21:37:59,MarvTheHugPharaoh,meads cooler 
428,2022-01-13 21:38:01,Chalodraws,Because no one should use it on their pancakes. XD

433,2022-01-13 21:38:39,SageSaga,its not honey-
434,2022-01-13 21:38:48,MatyMaty,I'd even take condensed milk instead
435,2022-01-13 21:38:48,SageSaga,at all- do you not have a word for Syrup?
436,2022-01-13 21:38:57,Mihari,Ron the fact you put a boob window on a chinese dress triggers me to no end.

541,2022-01-13 22:01:50,MatyMaty,why $12? XD
542,2022-01-13 22:02:54,Nekonny,cause it's been 12 years
543,2022-01-13 22:03:00,Mihari,I'll take a random donation! :D
544,2022-01-13 22:03:04,Nekonny,and $10 is a nice round number
545,2022-01-13 22:03:11,Nekonny,after paypal takes its fees
546,2022-01-13 22:03:49,Mihari,That is a terrible reason with depressing logic.
547,2022-01-13 22:04:00,Nekonny,wonders what mihari is up to
548,2022-01-13 22:04:10,Mihari,Nothing.
549,2022-01-13 22:04:15,TheSexyBeast,PayPal: still sketchy after all these years
550,2022-01-13 22:04:29,Mislakane,hellos

553,2022-01-13 22:05:17,Nekonny,"well, you know what they say; don't take wooden nickels"
554,2022-01-13 22:05:32,Ordithus,never heard that before
555,2022-01-13 22:05:56,MatyMaty,Neither O_O
556,2022-01-13 22:06:01,TheSexyBeast,Old timers saying

559,2022-01-13 22:07:06,Mihari,Money is nice... it helps. XD
560,2022-01-13 22:07:21,Nekonny,"icles are made of nickel, but before that they were silver, then nickel aagain,t hen wood"
561,2022-01-13 22:07:31,Mihari,And it's not like I can randomly open up a few commissions if I want some extra cash XD
562,2022-01-13 22:07:33,Nekonny,this was before the invention of nickel
563,2022-01-13 22:07:42,Nekonny,waits for it
564,2022-01-13 22:08:01,MatyMaty,nickels were made of wood? where
565,2022-01-13 22:08:05,TheSexyBeast,Nickel or Nickle?
566,2022-01-13 22:08:05,Mislakane,"mihari's make up tech service, pay me and stuff just works"
567,2022-01-13 22:08:13,Bralios,:lion_face::meat_on_bone::fire:

569,2022-01-13 22:08:37,Ordithus,hi food lion
570,2022-01-13 22:08:42,Mihari,"I got out of the web making service, people make my head hurt. And I don't need that kind of stress anymore."
571,2022-01-13 22:08:46,MatyMaty,I mean even Romans and ancient Greeks had metal coins
572,2022-01-13 22:08:56,Mislakane,oop x-x
573,2022-01-13 22:09:07,Nekonny,the wooden ones didnt survive
574,2022-01-13 22:09:15,SageSaga,wooden ones didnt exist
575,2022-01-13 22:09:39,SageSaga,the meaning of the saying is dont be scammed or dont accept work for no pay- right?
576,2022-01-13 22:09:53,MatyMaty,I would think wood coins would be way too easy to counterfeit
577,2022-01-13 22:10:07,SageSaga,they are- thats the point of the saying
578,2022-01-13 22:10:16,Mislakane,mahogony wood only
579,2022-01-13 22:10:19,SageSaga,im fairly certain we never had wooden currency 
580,2022-01-13 22:10:57,SageSaga,yeah quick google search said banks and stuff would hand them out as tokens
582,2022-01-13 22:11:03,SageSaga,they werent real currency
581,2022-01-13 22:11:03,Ordithus,our paper money is mostly cotton (US)
583,2022-01-13 22:11:12,MatyMaty,Maybe it was cryptocurrency and that's why it doesn't exist
584,2022-01-13 22:11:22,Nekonny,who's gonna bother counterfiting 5 cents?
585,2022-01-13 22:11:28,MachGao,you never know
586,2022-01-13 22:11:35,MachGao,someone could try and counterfit enough 
587,2022-01-13 22:11:35,Ordithus,no one will expect it! muahahaha!
588,2022-01-13 22:11:36,TheSexyBeast,Crypto nickels

594,2022-01-13 22:11:57,Flake,i still dont get how people cash out on crypto and the whole ntf can of worms 
595,2022-01-13 22:12:00,MatyMaty,people would get coins from one country and go to another to cheat vending machines
596,2022-01-13 22:12:01,SageSaga,back in the day you could get a chocolate bar for a nickel 
597,2022-01-13 22:12:03,Ordithus,though amazon has 100 packs of plastic pennies... like $5 for 300 pennies
598,2022-01-13 22:12:05,Ordithus,um

639,2022-01-13 22:16:41,MatyMaty,back then the bitcoin was like

643,2022-01-13 22:16:57,MachGao,yeaah
644,2022-01-13 22:17:04,Ordithus,"I remember when bitcoin was this weird stupid idea. then it became big, and look who was stupid"
645,2022-01-13 22:17:09,MachGao,a hard case of hindsight for a lot of people. though to be fair
646,2022-01-13 22:17:18,MachGao,something like bitcoin and its boom rarely happens
647,2022-01-13 22:17:19,MatyMaty,But I guess that dude giving them away for newds is regretting it even more :P
648,2022-01-13 22:17:26,Nekonny,"No regrets maty, truth is; you would have sold it long before it hit 60k"
649,2022-01-13 22:17:28,MachGao,oh yeah
650,2022-01-13 22:17:32,Mislakane,"I lost a million to see boobs, whyyyyy"
652,2022-01-13 22:17:41,MachGao,strip clubs would have loved him
651,2022-01-13 22:17:41,Nekonny,could be worse; you could have bought it at 67
653,2022-01-13 22:17:55,MachGao,also bitcoin wallets get hacked often
654,2022-01-13 22:18:06,MachGao,so there's a constant security battle involving them
655,2022-01-13 22:18:06,Ordithus,they'd have kicked him out!
656,2022-01-13 22:18:08,Nekonny,"Mach, booms happen all the time"
657,2022-01-13 22:18:08,MatyMaty,"I didn't even bought it Neko, I got it from a guy in a message board XD"
658,2022-01-13 22:18:25,Nekonny,Meme Stocks
659,2022-01-13 22:18:32,Nekonny,for example
660,2022-01-13 22:18:43,MatyMaty,and I wish I had saved it
661,2022-01-13 22:19:02,SageSaga,how are you merging these Ron?
662,2022-01-13 22:19:03,MachGao,Dogecoin was a boom yeah that's right
663,2022-01-13 22:19:14,MatyMaty,"thanks to Elon Musk, yeah"
664,2022-01-13 22:19:30,Bralios,"The wish to have gotten into some things before they were big, naturally."
665,2022-01-13 22:19:30,Ordithus,born a meme
666,2022-01-13 22:19:40,Mediawatcher37,"I remember when that was a thing, and then it fell hard"
667,2022-01-13 22:19:44,MachGao,the ability to create coins makes it easy to create a pump and dump coin that doesnt go anywhere
668,2022-01-13 22:19:57,Mediawatcher37,I’m happy I don’t invest in those
669,2022-01-13 22:19:59,Bralios,"If I were lucky enough for that, there'd be a whole lot more snack packages coming out for artists. :ramen:"
670,2022-01-13 22:20:00,MatyMaty,"that's called rug pulling nowadays, Mach"
671,2022-01-13 22:20:21,TheSexyBeast,Wasn't Dogecoin a rib on Bitcoin?
672,2022-01-13 22:20:26,Ordithus,yep
673,2022-01-13 22:20:30,Mediawatcher37,I think so
674,2022-01-13 22:20:38,MachGao,it was
675,2022-01-13 22:20:41,Nekonny,Good question sage
676,2022-01-13 22:20:48,MachGao,"but if the right person mentions it, or somehow goes viral"
677,2022-01-13 22:20:52,MachGao,then it can shoot up in value for a while
678,2022-01-13 22:20:52,Nekonny,"Tom, can you merge them all?"
679,2022-01-13 22:21:02,Nekonny,If I send you the files?
680,2022-01-13 22:21:05,Twokinds,Sure
681,2022-01-13 22:21:20,Nekonny,You may be able t o make better adjustments
682,2022-01-13 22:21:34,Ordithus,"outsourcing, excellent, Ron"
683,2022-01-13 22:23:15,Twokinds,It should be fine
684,2022-01-13 22:26:59,MachGao,man i am ready for the snow to go away
685,2022-01-13 22:27:10,Nekonny,cool thanks ^^
686,2022-01-13 22:27:43,MachGao,"to those that have never had snow or rarely get it, it loses its luster after about a day or two"
687,2022-01-13 22:28:20,Ordithus,"woah, a single bitcoin transaction uses more energy than my house in 2 months"
688,2022-01-13 22:28:27,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-floAAA:

692,2022-01-13 22:29:35,SageSaga,that still doesnt make sense
693,2022-01-13 22:29:38,Ordithus,"grain of salt and all that, but a single transaction apparently averages over 1 kWh"
694,2022-01-13 22:29:46,Ordithus,"oops, 1,000 kWh"
695,2022-01-13 22:29:59,Ordithus,I kilo-d the kilo
696,2022-01-13 22:30:12,MarvTheHugPharaoh,It's all the third party monitoring/farming

713,2022-01-13 22:32:41,Roughlandin,Hoi hoi!
714,2022-01-13 22:32:41,Flake,have you seen how many gpus they use to farm that thing?
715,2022-01-13 22:32:54,TheSexyBeast,👋 Rough
716,2022-01-13 22:32:54,SageSaga,thats not a transaction- that is mining
717,2022-01-13 22:33:03,SageSaga,he said a transaction 
719,2022-01-13 22:33:09,SageSaga,the sending of a bitcoin
718,2022-01-13 22:33:09,Flake,ah
720,2022-01-13 22:33:10,MachGao,an actual transaction is like sending paypal money
721,2022-01-13 22:33:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Mining is the monitoring of the transactions 
722,2022-01-13 22:33:27,Ustudios,hello
723,2022-01-13 22:33:40,Mediawatcher37,Apparently it’s led to a shortage or something
724,2022-01-13 22:34:02,Roughlandin,What Marv said. Mining is how the blockchain verifies each transaction is valid
725,2022-01-13 22:34:16,Roughlandin,And why it's so energy intensive
726,2022-01-13 22:34:19,Ustudios,day 16 of covid.... I started to count the spots on my roof...
727,2022-01-13 22:34:20,Ordithus,hi ustudios o/
728,2022-01-13 22:34:30,Mediawatcher37,Hey ustudios
729,2022-01-13 22:34:32,Ordithus,yikes!
730,2022-01-13 22:34:34,Roughlandin,Oof feel better Ustudios
731,2022-01-13 22:34:37,Mediawatcher37,Sorry to hear
732,2022-01-13 22:34:55,Ustudios,yeah I did the test to see if I was free nope still positive so back to the room for 7 days
733,2022-01-13 22:35:15,Ordithus,"Sage Kate is so pretty, nice work! :ptv-hearts:"
734,2022-01-13 22:35:22,Ustudios,thankfully I feel ok I think but I dont wanna get my father sick so back to the locked room
735,2022-01-13 22:35:37,Roughlandin,Stay safe!
736,2022-01-13 22:35:49,Ustudios,everyone do so this shit is really crazy contagious
737,2022-01-13 22:36:07,Ustudios,getting a friend a day calling me saying they caught it too
738,2022-01-13 22:36:22,SageSaga,im still confused- i dont think mining has to do with monitoring 
739,2022-01-13 22:36:57,Roughlandin,"It absolutely does, Sage. Mining is how the transactions are run. Miners earn a transaction fee for facilitating transactions"
740,2022-01-13 22:37:07,Ordithus,"yeah, I don't know how bitcoin actually works. just parroting what I got when I asked le google"

753,2022-01-13 22:38:43,Chalodraws,Great work so far!
754,2022-01-13 22:39:08,SageSaga,im still pretty sure mining has nothing to do with monitoring transactions- im sure miners can also set themselves up as monitoring services but i dont think its the same at all
755,2022-01-13 22:39:25,ZapiliDver,mining is a calculating hash functions and so on
756,2022-01-13 22:39:26,Ustudios,Blades  I think blue would be a bit to contrasting for the harmony of the pic considering tinas colors purple works better because it is contrasting but alo harmonizes since purple is red and blue mix
757,2022-01-13 22:39:30,SageSaga,mining is the act of creating a block chain right?
758,2022-01-13 22:39:32,Ustudios,hope I made sense
759,2022-01-13 22:39:39,ZapiliDver,so it's require a lot of computing power
760,2022-01-13 22:39:44,Roughlandin,The block chain IS the transaction verification
761,2022-01-13 22:39:53,DarthRexKing,Hi chalo. Wait he's done?
762,2022-01-13 22:40:12,BLADEDGE,@Ustudios oh. I was just thinking about the RYB Color model of complementry colors
763,2022-01-13 22:40:15,MachGao,think he did a mistaken drop
764,2022-01-13 22:40:28,DarthRexKing,Oh. Okay. V:
765,2022-01-13 22:40:50,SageSaga,see this doesnt make sense to me and i will explain why-
766,2022-01-13 22:42:04,SageSaga,if i remember correctly back in the day i could mine for bit coin- there wasnt a lot of people transferring bitcoin back then so these coins had to be made- minted- mined- then as they got used their transaction history got recorded to the coin- the block
767,2022-01-13 22:42:06,SageSaga,chain-
768,2022-01-13 22:43:08,SageSaga,it seems you are saying now you dont mine for bitcoin or crypto- but rather you just keep an eye on bitcoin already in circulation?
769,2022-01-13 22:43:17,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Yes
770,2022-01-13 22:43:29,SageSaga,so its not mining anymore
771,2022-01-13 22:43:33,Roughlandin,"There is a finite number of coins. That's why crypto is supposed to have ""value"""
773,2022-01-13 22:43:50,Roughlandin,"...Personally, I'd still debate that, but that's the theory"
772,2022-01-13 22:43:50,SageSaga,you are crypto book-keeping
774,2022-01-13 22:44:15,Ordithus,:eyes: cyoot Tina
775,2022-01-13 22:44:22,Roughlandin,Yes. You're verifying that the coin that was sent is the same coin that was received. And that no coins were lost or duplicated
777,2022-01-13 22:44:47,SageSaga,and you are paid for that fee - in bit coin?
776,2022-01-13 22:44:47,Roughlandin,"And to do that requires a lot of hardware intensive calculations, apparently"
778,2022-01-13 22:44:54,Roughlandin,Yes
779,2022-01-13 22:44:58,SageSaga,but then someone has to check that-
780,2022-01-13 22:45:06,CrRAR,"yeah, incentivized mathematical witnesses"
781,2022-01-13 22:45:06,SageSaga,it creates an infinite loop
782,2022-01-13 22:45:17,Ordithus,:cw0lfmare-GoogleyEmber:
783,2022-01-13 22:45:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Welcome to the stupid world that is ""Ew paper money"""
784,2022-01-13 22:45:48,Roughlandin,I'm pretty sure the verification for the fee is factored into the transaction being verified
785,2022-01-13 22:46:09,Roughlandin,But idk. I don't exactly have much faith in the longevity of crypto myself
786,2022-01-13 22:46:13,SageSaga,but that fee is paid in bitcoin which needs to be verified
787,2022-01-13 22:46:51,MarvTheHugPharaoh,By another miner 
788,2022-01-13 22:47:03,MarvTheHugPharaoh,When used in a transaction 
789,2022-01-13 22:47:27,SageSaga,but it was
790,2022-01-13 22:47:34,SageSaga,it was payment for your transaction-
791,2022-01-13 22:47:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Yep
792,2022-01-13 22:47:47,Roughlandin,Ot
793,2022-01-13 22:47:49,Twokinds,I do wonder if the bubble will one day burst.
794,2022-01-13 22:47:50,Roughlandin,Blargh
795,2022-01-13 22:47:52,CrRAR,"what's crazy is the services Blockchain also enables, like file storage or streaming video or all other manner of computation"
796,2022-01-13 22:48:00,SageSaga,so someone needs to verify that - and then verify that- and verify that-
797,2022-01-13 22:48:10,ZapiliDver,We will get anotehr .com bubble burst
798,2022-01-13 22:48:15,Ordithus,each time the chain gets longer
799,2022-01-13 22:48:16,SageSaga,no wonder they use so much power- they are in an endless loop
800,2022-01-13 22:48:22,CrRAR,rack network is like its own distributed supercomputer
801,2022-01-13 22:48:28,CrRAR,*each

817,2022-01-13 22:50:40,ZapiliDver,use mixer service for privacy
818,2022-01-13 22:50:56,CrRAR,yeah Bitcoin was kind of a proof of concept for other blockchains that actually do accomplish things by computation
819,2022-01-13 22:51:28,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Don't need people seeing me use monkey art to pay for Teddy's onlyfans.  I'll just use debit

843,2022-01-13 22:55:38,Roughlandin,Three of the lug nuts were stripped

871,2022-01-13 22:59:41,Roughlandin,Yeah we got the tires changed and I guess they stripped them then
872,2022-01-13 22:59:51,Roughlandin,Which explains why two of the five were already steel

1200,2022-01-13 23:41:08,KeefMcDerpface,ok
1201,2022-01-13 23:41:46,MatyMaty,Because Dryads and the like are from greek myth?
1202,2022-01-13 23:41:51,MatyMaty,they are kinda elves
1203,2022-01-13 23:42:00,Roughlandin,Yeah dryads are basically elves
1204,2022-01-13 23:42:24,TheSexyBeast,I don't recall that in LOTR
1205,2022-01-13 23:43:00,Roughlandin,Basically everything about elves in modern pop culture comes from LoTR and Midsummer Night's Dream
1206,2022-01-13 23:43:01,MatyMaty,"well there were elves before LOTR, sorta"
1207,2022-01-13 23:43:26,MachGao,sorta?
1208,2022-01-13 23:43:36,MatyMaty,what I am not sure is who came up with the pointy ears
1209,2022-01-13 23:43:45,TheSexyBeast,Shoemaker and the elves?
1210,2022-01-13 23:43:56,MatyMaty,"well yes, before Tolkien elves weren't like, a superior version of humans"

1214,2022-01-13 23:44:39,MatyMaty,and in norse myth elves and dwarves were the same thing IIRC
1215,2022-01-13 23:44:57,SwiftKitten,i just watched  anetflix movie called bright or somthing
1216,2022-01-13 23:45:13,SwiftKitten,that had orcs and elves

1219,2022-01-13 23:45:39,SwiftKitten,yeah
1220,2022-01-13 23:45:49,SwiftKitten,it wasn't bad
1221,2022-01-13 23:46:02,SageSaga,but in D&D mythology people keep thinking Mt Celestia is Mt Olympus- but its not- Mt Olympus is in Arborea - which is where the elves are from
1222,2022-01-13 23:46:03,MachGao,didn't that get a sequel that was animated? or one that's coming out
1223,2022-01-13 23:46:05,SwiftKitten, a bit more gorey than i ussally like but
1224,2022-01-13 23:46:30,CrRAR,yeah that was a weird trend media got into for a bit
1225,2022-01-13 23:46:35,MatyMaty,Mt Celestia is where pastel colored horses live

1253,2022-01-13 23:49:14,MatyMaty,Greek myth had plenty of furries tho
1254,2022-01-13 23:49:14,Roughlandin,A very specific kind
1255,2022-01-13 23:49:24,MachGao,more than egypt?
1256,2022-01-13 23:49:26,Roughlandin,"They were all Zeus, Maty"

1259,2022-01-13 23:49:34,Roughlandin,Zeus was the OG furry
1260,2022-01-13 23:49:39,MatyMaty,"you know, see evil, smite evil?"
1261,2022-01-13 23:49:43,SageSaga,the Olypians were gods of passion 100%

1309,2022-01-13 23:53:51,MatyMaty, the demiurge
1310,2022-01-13 23:54:15,MatyMaty,who is supposed to be infinitely distant and infinitely indifferent
1311,2022-01-13 23:54:23,Ordithus,worms man is pretty neat. some people are really good on the inside. he's just worms on the inside
1312,2022-01-13 23:54:43,SageSaga,im mostly trying to think of ones that count as myth because so much of my knowledge is dnd -
1313,2022-01-13 23:54:55,MatyMaty,but I mean
1314,2022-01-13 23:54:58,MatyMaty,even dragons
1315,2022-01-13 23:55:04,Roughlandin,As to elves being fey or not. Tolkein took a lot of inspiration for his elves from Midsummer Night's Dream
1316,2022-01-13 23:55:05,MatyMaty,are all human emotions x1000
1317,2022-01-13 23:55:13,SageSaga,not really-
1318,2022-01-13 23:55:32,Rainelover,I finally got Herr Göring to break his morphine addiction 
1319,2022-01-13 23:55:45,Roughlandin,"Though Midsummer Night's Dream had faeries, not elves. But faeries ARE fey."
1320,2022-01-13 23:55:49,MatyMaty,mostly greed
1321,2022-01-13 23:55:51,MatyMaty,and pride
1322,2022-01-13 23:56:05,SageSaga,for one thing- its just emotion- not human emotion
1323,2022-01-13 23:56:16,MatyMaty,nothing else has emotion
1324,2022-01-13 23:56:18,SageSaga,and they mostly feel superior- and for good reason-
1325,2022-01-13 23:56:31,MatyMaty,only humans do
1326,2022-01-13 23:56:33,Roughlandin,":ctwokinds-renirawr: Technically, dragons felt it first!"
1327,2022-01-13 23:56:33,SageSaga,sure they do- its fiction
1328,2022-01-13 23:56:45,MatyMaty,yes but fiction made by humans :P
1329,2022-01-13 23:56:52,Roughlandin,Unless...
1330,2022-01-13 23:56:55,Roughlandin,:ctwokinds-raineshocked:
1331,2022-01-13 23:57:27,SageSaga,do you wanna argue that dragons emotions are human because we made them?
1332,2022-01-13 23:57:52,MatyMaty,"no, I'm saying myth dragons have human emotions taken to the extreme"
1333,2022-01-13 23:57:57,MatyMaty,at least western ones
1334,2022-01-13 23:58:18,Roughlandin,:croughlandin-LilReni: Extremely adorable

1337,2022-01-13 23:58:49,SageSaga,emotion doesnt gauge lawfulness - its acting on it
1338,2022-01-13 23:58:55,Rainelover,Interesting that nobody bats an eye at me mentioning Herman Göring and his goddamn morphine addiction 
1339,2022-01-13 23:59:35,TheSexyBeast,Elves and Dergs > nastys
1340,2022-01-13 23:59:37,SageSaga,chaotic evil dragons crush those trying to steal from them- lawful good ones will try to reason- and then crush- not much of a difference but a difference to be sure-
1341,2022-01-13 23:59:54,Roughlandin,"I mean, it's kinda been widely publicized that he was an opioid addict"
0,2022-01-14 00:00:08,Roughlandin,Just kinda... weird to be bringing up Nazis in chat

223,2022-01-14 00:38:20,KeefMcDerpface,brb
224,2022-01-14 00:38:29,Ordithus,Just how many Nora cards are in the works?
225,2022-01-14 00:38:44,steelabjur,Rose booty makes everything better!
226,2022-01-14 00:38:49,SageSaga,there it is
227,2022-01-14 00:38:50,MatyMaty,I thought Nora Cards were phased out
228,2022-01-14 00:39:06,MatyMaty,"Oooh, okay people question"
229,2022-01-14 00:39:18,Ordithus,lots of booty these streams
230,2022-01-14 00:39:24,InTheLionsDen,No new ones but some old ones are still outstanding
231,2022-01-14 00:39:26,MatyMaty,so this animation WiP sage has on right now has a kinda high frame number
232,2022-01-14 00:39:35,MatyMaty,almost 3 times the amount the other two
233,2022-01-14 00:39:41,MatyMaty,does it look better or nah?
234,2022-01-14 00:40:13,Ordithus,"it is definitely smoother, but the others are plenty enough to work"
235,2022-01-14 00:40:20,MachGao,yeah 
236,2022-01-14 00:40:23,MachGao,its very smooth
237,2022-01-14 00:40:41,MachGao,but im not sure if it would work the same way if you were trying to do something like the ball bounce
238,2022-01-14 00:40:42,MachGao,maybe
239,2022-01-14 00:40:44,MatyMaty,Mmmm I might lower the frame count then.
240,2022-01-14 00:40:53,MatyMaty,the ball bounce has like... 12 frames
241,2022-01-14 00:40:59,KeefMcDerpface,:eyes: back
242,2022-01-14 00:41:08,MatyMaty,the legs up one like 18 or 20
243,2022-01-14 00:41:25,MatyMaty,the WiP one would end up with like 50 or 60
244,2022-01-14 00:41:35,MatyMaty,but I wonder if that's overdoing it
245,2022-01-14 00:41:44,mingun,"@Twokinds Tom, will you be publish this colored sketch, Bare Rose from 2020-08-20?"
246,2022-01-14 00:41:58,Ordithus,"better, but diminishing returns are very much a thing"
247,2022-01-14 00:43:03,MachGao, the WiP does look good but did you intend for it to have that many frames or it just happened?
248,2022-01-14 00:43:13,MachGao,sorry im not super knowledgeable on animation work
249,2022-01-14 00:43:41,MatyMaty,I tried making it longer to get a smoother look. buuut I am not sure if if is worth the effort
250,2022-01-14 00:43:43,SageSaga,ok to close it? XD
251,2022-01-14 00:44:12,MatyMaty,also still not sure if catboy (as it is now) or catgirl XD
252,2022-01-14 00:44:20,Twokinds,yes
253,2022-01-14 00:44:25,Ordithus,oh dear
254,2022-01-14 00:44:29,MachGao,...i didnt even notice that was a femboy
255,2022-01-14 00:44:47,KeefMcDerpface,same
256,2022-01-14 00:45:18,MachGao,i think you could get away with it having the same  amount of frames as the other two
257,2022-01-14 00:45:28,MatyMaty,"alrighty, I think I will do that"
258,2022-01-14 00:46:41,MachGao,and now sage has to leave the WiP there for the rest of the stream
260,2022-01-14 00:48:32,MatyMaty,I guess the downside is that one of the current anims will have to go 
259,2022-01-14 00:48:32,MachGao,"yeah, no need to make more work for yourself than necessary "
261,2022-01-14 00:48:41,MatyMaty,once a new one happens
262,2022-01-14 00:48:51,MachGao,maybe the current leg one
263,2022-01-14 00:48:55,MachGao,the new one becomes legs part 2
264,2022-01-14 00:49:14,MachGao,legs: Boy edition 
265,2022-01-14 00:49:26,Ordithus,eventually sage's stream will just be maty animations
266,2022-01-14 00:49:32,MatyMaty,Lol Ord
267,2022-01-14 00:49:35,KeefMcDerpface,hah

622,2022-01-14 15:18:34,Ordithus,Turns out it's tomorrow!
623,2022-01-14 15:19:01,SageSaga,im pretty sure that today is today...
624,2022-01-14 15:19:16,Ordithus,That's what you would expect

632,2022-01-14 16:30:19,Ordithus,wb Sage
633,2022-01-14 16:32:17,SageSaga,ty- man this past week my brother moved to a new home and hes actually close by now-
634,2022-01-14 16:33:09,SageSaga,his son wanted help with a video game and he kept asking me to help
635,2022-01-14 16:33:55,CrRAR,anything familiar?
636,2022-01-14 16:34:13,SageSaga,Skyward sword
637,2022-01-14 16:34:37,CrRAR,"ah, must be the HD remake"
638,2022-01-14 16:35:31,SageSaga,"i said ""Why do you want my help and not your dads?"" and he said ""But you're like- a pro gamer!"""
639,2022-01-14 16:36:19,CrRAR,at least this confirms you as the cool uncle
640,2022-01-14 16:38:38,SageSaga,"later he was crying saying the games toooooo hard! and why dont they make a version for kids thats not as hard! and to calm him down i was like ""Lemme tell ya a story about a game- a game called DARK SOULS"""
641,2022-01-14 16:39:01,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-nathaha:
642,2022-01-14 16:39:36,CrRAR,where dying is PART of the learning process
643,2022-01-14 16:40:00,CrRAR,you die to learn how to die less bad next time
644,2022-01-14 16:40:13,CrRAR,till you win  \o/
645,2022-01-14 16:41:06,SageSaga,yeah i wanted to try to get him to understand he needs to try new things to learn it - and once you learn it you can just do it
646,2022-01-14 16:46:12,CrRAR,"Zelda always has that one part of the game where sometimes you have to backtrack or you miss something that isn’t obvious, the majority of puzzles should just trigger critical thinking"
647,2022-01-14 16:47:56,CrRAR,you’d swear occasionally the level/narrative designers dropped the ball in some circumstances
648,2022-01-14 16:48:02,SageSaga,yeah- unfortunately hes been afflicted with everyone telling him hes smart- and now he thinks he just knows everything
649,2022-01-14 16:48:41,SageSaga,so now if he cant immediately figure something out- he thinks its something impossibly hard
650,2022-01-14 16:49:12,CrRAR,“Just chopping it with the sword usually always works!”
651,2022-01-14 16:49:42,SageSaga,i actually think that solves this puzzle he was stuck on-
652,2022-01-14 16:50:04,Ordithus,"if not sword, arrow! if not arrow, bombs!"
653,2022-01-14 16:51:14,CrRAR,they did have a lot of puzzles in that involved the sword as a key type thing
654,2022-01-14 16:51:18,MysticWav,All kids need to be brought up on the NES and gradually advanced up the videogame tech tree
655,2022-01-14 16:51:24,CrRAR,was it the quicksand area?
656,2022-01-14 16:51:24,MysticWav,NES games were intentionally brutal
657,2022-01-14 16:51:55,Ordithus,NES games were cryptic. 
658,2022-01-14 16:52:22,Ordithus,"It was... a time. It's cool what was made, but really, few of those old games are really any good."
659,2022-01-14 16:52:51,SageSaga,omg i just looked it up- he should totally be able to accidentally do this-
660,2022-01-14 16:52:57,MysticWav,"Heh, I was comfort playing a few on the switch the other day.  They still feel pretty good"
661,2022-01-14 16:53:09,CrRAR,"“we’re throwing science at the wall here, see what sticks!”"
662,2022-01-14 16:53:14,Ordithus,"if you enjoy them, great!"
663,2022-01-14 16:53:47,SageSaga,its one of those puzzles where you move things- they all move at the same time- then you just need to block them to line them up

669,2022-01-14 16:56:25,Ordithus,"that's awful, sorry, mystic"
670,2022-01-14 16:56:32,MysticWav,Thanks.
671,2022-01-14 16:57:42,MysticWav,I'm getting a lot of good support.
672,2022-01-14 17:00:32,MysticWav,So what are some of everyone's favorite videogames from their formative years?
673,2022-01-14 17:00:46,Ordithus,Spyro! The original PS1 games
674,2022-01-14 17:07:02,Ordithus,"Also, Final Fantasy Tactics. Sad my copy no longer wants to work"
675,2022-01-14 17:07:57,SageSaga,i too want to say FFT but- it was not in my formative years-
676,2022-01-14 17:09:09,SageSaga,FF6 though- closer-
677,2022-01-14 17:09:27,SageSaga,probably the Kings Quests series though-
678,2022-01-14 17:09:30,MysticWav,Good picks
679,2022-01-14 17:10:33,SageSaga,"""Ah, life giving water, nectar of the gods"""
680,2022-01-14 17:12:18,SageSaga,oh and Hero Quest- though that wasnt a video game-
681,2022-01-14 17:12:20,MysticWav,"I wonder if you could find it on one of the modern platforms, Ord."
682,2022-01-14 17:12:35,MysticWav,"Wait, like the D&D light board game?"
683,2022-01-14 17:12:41,SageSaga,yep
684,2022-01-14 17:12:59,MysticWav,Nice.  My poor parents having to play that with me.
685,2022-01-14 17:13:14,SageSaga,also played DnD 2nd edition but not much- we reaally started playing dnd with 3rd edition though
686,2022-01-14 17:13:20,Ordithus,"it sort of exists as a gameboy advance game and ios and android versions. but none of them are really the original, I think"
687,2022-01-14 17:13:57,SageSaga,there is a mobile version of FFT and yeah- its - not great unless they fixed it-
688,2022-01-14 17:14:28,Ordithus,probably easier to find a functioning ps1 disc
689,2022-01-14 17:14:36,SageSaga,but not cheaper-
690,2022-01-14 17:14:50,Ordithus,"true, but it isn't horribly expensive, eithr"
691,2022-01-14 17:14:54,SageSaga,original FFT disks last i saw were selling for 100 bucks
692,2022-01-14 17:16:03,SageSaga,oh!
693,2022-01-14 17:16:52,SageSaga,they did the greatest hits run of PS1 games and FFT was reprinted then- so there should be a lot out there- and yeah you can get just the disk for 10-20 bucks- not sure if they are in decent condition
694,2022-01-14 17:17:05,Ordithus,"mine is greatest hits, already"
695,2022-01-14 17:17:08,SageSaga,but if you wanted an unopened copy they are like 120 for collectors
696,2022-01-14 17:17:18,MysticWav,After Hero Quest I diverged off into Battletech.  Didn't get back to table top RPGs until 4th
697,2022-01-14 17:17:22,Ordithus,I would be happy with a good condition disc
698,2022-01-14 17:17:50,SageSaga,4th edition was a dark time for DnD
699,2022-01-14 17:20:03,SageSaga,"4th edition itself wasnt as bad as most people say it was- but- it did cause some major issues, and those responsible for the lore and stuff were pretty upset over all the changes that were made to ""simplify"" the world"
700,2022-01-14 17:20:41,SageSaga,so when 5th edition came out and they had the opportunity- they retconned a ton of stuff
701,2022-01-14 17:21:22,Hogan,*shudders* I made it only a bit into the PHB 4th edition before I ditched the entire edition
702,2022-01-14 17:21:31,MysticWav,It felt very much like an attempt to capitalize on the WoW craze of the time
703,2022-01-14 17:22:00,Ordithus,5th ed is the only dnd I know
704,2022-01-14 17:22:28,Hogan,I'm a child of the second edition XD
705,2022-01-14 17:24:33,SageSaga,you were conceived during a second edition game?
706,2022-01-14 17:26:03,SageSaga,they took role play serious back in the day

711,2022-01-14 17:27:46,SageSaga,"""Are you wearing your ring of contraception?"" ""Uhh- yes?"" ""Roll Deception"" ""Nat 20!"""
712,2022-01-14 17:27:55,Hogan,"""I said SLAY the Dragon, not LAY the dragon!"""

714,2022-01-14 17:29:16,Hogan,The unmodded THAC0 was no match for a natural 20
715,2022-01-14 17:29:28,SageSaga,btw- imagine living in a world where most things were determined by your skill- and broken up into 5% increments 
716,2022-01-14 17:30:02,Hogan,... and where you could exceed 100%  to make up for the negative modifiers...

800,2022-01-14 21:42:11,CrRAR,"so like, if you’re headed toward a light and it turns yellow and you’re not within the solid zone, you’re better off stopping"
801,2022-01-14 21:42:16,Ordithus,half the time the lines are all but gone thanks to salt and snow plows
802,2022-01-14 21:42:37,CrRAR,yeah I’d imagine not everywhere would have them
803,2022-01-14 21:42:45,CrRAR,depends on the locality
804,2022-01-14 21:42:50,SpazztasticKiwi,far as I could tell they were yellow while I was under em
805,2022-01-14 21:43:20,Ordithus,"I can't speak for all states, but for the most part if you entered yellow you're fine. entering red is the no-no"
806,2022-01-14 21:43:34,CrRAR,"yeah I mean yellow passing is okay, just gotta air on the side of caution for best practice"
807,2022-01-14 21:44:37,SpazztasticKiwi,I normally stop when I see yellow but the 2 times specifically here I entered the section on yellow 
808,2022-01-14 21:45:30,CrRAR,"yeah, it happens"
809,2022-01-14 21:45:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"it turned red either as I was under or after I passed, & one of em had someone pass behind me so either the yellow was longer than most or they def ran a red"
810,2022-01-14 21:46:17,CrRAR,"yeah it’s judged by the stop line basically, if spotted depending on how struct the cop is being, too"
811,2022-01-14 21:46:58,Ordithus,"there's an intersection when I leave work, turning left with the arrow, the arrow lasts way less time than it takes to actually get through"
812,2022-01-14 21:47:12,CrRAR,"it’s all about safety, dumb judgment is gets attention 99- of the time"
813,2022-01-14 21:47:41,CrRAR,yeah some turnarounds I’ve seen sometimes it’s like just 1.5 cars time xD
814,2022-01-14 21:47:58,Ordithus,that intersection is also the most dangerous part of my commute
815,2022-01-14 21:48:09,Ordithus,I've seen so many semis barrel through reds there at 60+
816,2022-01-14 21:48:35,CrRAR,it’s a miracle some traffic circles have so few problems around here
817,2022-01-14 21:49:04,CrRAR,it’s like shoving 20 cars into a roller derby deathmatch sometimes
818,2022-01-14 21:49:15,SpazztasticKiwi,at some point it became a question if I was sure they were yellow & the fact I didn’t get pulled over but the cameras mean there could be a problem & it takes 30 days to make a judgement if they send me anything 
819,2022-01-14 21:50:07,SpazztasticKiwi,but I know unless my car was completely unable to stop I’d stop at a red & even sometimes at a yellow but if it’s yellow when I’m up on it I use the time to go ahead 
820,2022-01-14 21:50:13,CrRAR,"I think the cameras activate specifically when red pops for any one still going through, mostly where they’re actually used"
821,2022-01-14 21:50:27,SpazztasticKiwi,yea that’s what I read
822,2022-01-14 21:50:40,CrRAR,so like anyone passing ‘stop’ after the red is visible
823,2022-01-14 21:50:50,SpazztasticKiwi,oh man there’s some stories to tell
824,2022-01-14 21:51:27,SpazztasticKiwi,i took a trip to pay a bill & my mother wanted to come along so she wouldn’t have to drive her car 
825,2022-01-14 21:51:58,CrRAR,"oh no, parent ride-alongs can be the worst"
826,2022-01-14 21:52:00,SpazztasticKiwi,this was like months ago at this point but I was the first in a line of about 6 cars when a red truck came in my side mirror 
827,2022-01-14 21:52:04,SpazztasticKiwi,no pass zone
828,2022-01-14 21:52:12,SpazztasticKiwi,passing 6 cars 
829,2022-01-14 21:52:35,SpazztasticKiwi,"speeding because I was going the limit and to get around us, you’d have to speed"
830,2022-01-14 21:53:10,CrRAR,"those are the sketchiest, the two lane passes let alone WHEN it’s allowed"
831,2022-01-14 21:53:14,SpazztasticKiwi,then the third car back turned on his lights & siren
832,2022-01-14 21:53:30,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-karenOOO:
833,2022-01-14 21:53:51,CrRAR,"yeah doing that will get attention quick, that and using breakdown lanes unexpectedly"
834,2022-01-14 21:54:28,SpazztasticKiwi,behind me was a black truck and then the undercover was unsurprisingly a black suv
835,2022-01-14 21:54:32,Ordithus,there's illegal. there is unsafe. then there is unsafe and illegal :police_car: 
836,2022-01-14 21:54:39,CrRAR,"I’m honestly surprised the single lane passing is still so widely allowed in places, the roads are just so crazy these days"
837,2022-01-14 21:55:58,SpazztasticKiwi,i remember a  white car in our little follow the leader
838,2022-01-14 21:56:46,SpazztasticKiwi,i was holding all of them up but I wasn’t going over what that little sign said on the side of the road - there could be a cop somewhere  
839,2022-01-14 21:56:57,SpazztasticKiwi,turns out he was practically behind me but
840,2022-01-14 21:57:46,Ordithus,"something neat in Alaska - on a 2 lane road, if there are 5 or more cars behind you, you are required to pull over and let them pass"
841,2022-01-14 21:58:26,SpazztasticKiwi,i pulled over cause the cop couldn’t exactly pass us in the no pass zone either given stupid had already given the finger to the grim reaper with his stunt
842,2022-01-14 21:59:27,SpazztasticKiwi,but the lady in the truck behind me didn’t pull over right off - I’m hoping they caught him but the cop had a hang up there
843,2022-01-14 22:00:49,SpazztasticKiwi,"I knew as soon as he turned on his lights, he was after that truck & not me but at the same time you’re supposed to move over anyway "
844,2022-01-14 22:02:10,SpazztasticKiwi,"same town, I was leaving after paying a different bill & a fire rescue truck lights up right behind me at a stop sign "
845,2022-01-14 22:02:43,SpazztasticKiwi,nothing like a siren sounding right behind you at a stop
846,2022-01-14 22:03:32,SpazztasticKiwi,facinating to see how many people I’ve seen fail to pull over for a firetruck or cop with lights on
847,2022-01-14 22:04:48,SpazztasticKiwi,or worse ambulance 
848,2022-01-14 22:05:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"but speaking of my mom, before christmas I went with her and my grandma in my car to jasper to shop & she found a bookshelf she wanted to get for my sister for christmas "
849,2022-01-14 22:06:20,SpazztasticKiwi,i told her it wouldn’t fit in my car - she says it will - I go out to measure for sure & come in to tell her it’s definitely not gonna fit
850,2022-01-14 22:06:40,SpazztasticKiwi,& she’s got a worker standing there with it on a loading dolly anyway 
851,2022-01-14 22:06:47,SpazztasticKiwi,it didnt fit
852,2022-01-14 22:07:42,CrRAR,not even bungie-cords possible?
853,2022-01-14 22:07:50,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t have any
854,2022-01-14 22:07:59,CrRAR,ah well
855,2022-01-14 22:08:10,SpazztasticKiwi,& I’m not gonna haul anything that has to hang out my car at all
856,2022-01-14 22:08:24,Ordithus,"do you still have that little car, or did you buy something?"
857,2022-01-14 22:08:28,SpazztasticKiwi,all doors closed or you’re finding yourself another vehicle 
858,2022-01-14 22:08:30,CrRAR,it is always sketchy doing that
859,2022-01-14 22:08:42,SpazztasticKiwi,plus I had Bagheera with me
860,2022-01-14 22:08:52,Ordithus,he could hold it
861,2022-01-14 22:09:05,CrRAR,"lol, bagheera: chief safety officer"
862,2022-01-14 22:09:11,SpazztasticKiwi,im bot going down the road for a 45 minute drive at 70 with my back hatch open even slightly

709,2022-01-15 17:16:46,ProsePro7,It would be cool if Tom did a side comic not focused on the main story.  The snow sneps or Colin and Sam side comic would be a welcome aside.
710,2022-01-15 17:16:47,Roughlandin,But capitalizing every word makes your comments... kinda hard to read
711,2022-01-15 17:16:57,KuroSuki64,"A little, but yes"

845,2022-01-15 17:26:58,BadFoMo,Dare I ask why a 3D Nibbly?
846,2022-01-15 17:27:06,Kynum,What? You don't want to model and rig dozens of characters?
847,2022-01-15 17:27:15,yFamous,So Nubbs is like the test character?  
848,2022-01-15 17:27:18,Twokinds,Because she's a small simple character to start out on?
849,2022-01-15 17:27:20,yFamous,Nibbs
850,2022-01-15 17:27:22,InTheLionsDen,Got to start somewhere.

855,2022-01-15 17:28:00,Roughlandin,Then once you master that... 4D ART!
856,2022-01-15 17:28:05,TeapotOfDoom,would you be willing to show the models at all?
857,2022-01-15 17:28:08,Twokinds,Sure

1036,2022-01-15 17:46:10,SpazztasticKiwi,its very pretty & at least they get the “don’t be a controlling parent” thing across

1050,2022-01-15 17:47:38,MoonDance,But that doesn't mean you should give up on it. Look for an artist you admire a lot who has anime-inspired styles
1051,2022-01-15 17:47:39,CrimsonQuill086,It will...evolve as you do.

3038,2022-01-15 20:39:37,SuperTaster,and because it's an easy way to make assets liquid
3039,2022-01-15 20:39:40,Brocade,The obvious sequel is for Kat to come bock on screen and Laura to join her
3040,2022-01-15 20:39:50,tecbot,it is highly higly speculative
3041,2022-01-15 20:39:50,SuperTaster,"so no, it's not good even for what it does"
3042,2022-01-15 20:39:59,ShamusTheFox,People are also banking on people not knowing anything about it
3043,2022-01-15 20:40:00,LGBTQAnimalKingdom,Kat has gone crosswide

3049,2022-01-15 20:40:20,SuperTaster,"rough: sure, which is why people who do want to are hyping it"
3050,2022-01-15 20:40:26,Mediawatcher37,"It never premiered, so they lied"
