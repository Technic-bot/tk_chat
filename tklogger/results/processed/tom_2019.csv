95,2019-01-01 16:18:19,Twokinds,I guess
134,2019-01-01 16:44:15,Twokinds,Nora's magic would still affect most Basitin.
136,2019-01-01 16:45:27,Twokinds,Basitin become more resist to magic the stronger they are. Adelaide is almost completely immune to direct magic.
138,2019-01-01 16:45:39,Twokinds,(Though of course you could still use magic to throw a rock at her or something)

102,2019-01-06 16:58:43,Twokinds,Though it is an interesting thought
103,2019-01-06 16:59:02,Twokinds,Could make for an intriging angle.
104,2019-01-06 16:59:15,Twokinds,"Clovis hates foxes, but has a half brother who is full fox."
106,2019-01-06 16:59:53,Twokinds,"I'd say if they were, Carver would be younger"
108,2019-01-06 17:00:57,Twokinds,Maybe his mother leaving to have another son with a different father also fueled Clovis' misogyny.
116,2019-01-06 18:40:14,Twokinds,"Oh right, it is, isn't it?"
117,2019-01-06 18:40:25,Twokinds,I couldn't remember if I'd ever mentioned it before
118,2019-01-06 18:40:33,Twokinds,And I didn't want to try looking it up on stream

344,2019-01-06 23:02:38,Twokinds,I feel like it would be uncomfortable

382,2019-01-06 23:52:13,Twokinds,Monopoly.

6,2019-01-07 00:04:55,Twokinds,Never
7,2019-01-07 00:05:11,Twokinds,The last time I got to play was when my brother was in the hospital.
8,2019-01-07 00:05:14,Twokinds,One of the times...
9,2019-01-07 00:05:36,Twokinds,I don't remember which one. I think it was like three hospital trips ago.
15,2019-01-07 00:09:27,Twokinds,Eh they don't want to play Monopoly.

387,2019-01-07 22:53:57,Twokinds,Not bad. Busy. Haven't had a lot of time to do anything today.
389,2019-01-07 22:55:51,Twokinds,"Well, I mean busy with real life stuff. Cleaning the house."
390,2019-01-07 22:56:05,Twokinds,Needs to be taken care of at least once in a while.
392,2019-01-07 22:56:35,Twokinds,Haven't had time to do internet stuff - the stuff that matters!
403,2019-01-07 23:18:46,Twokinds,Luckily wash day is only on Saturday
404,2019-01-07 23:18:52,Twokinds,According to Alexa
409,2019-01-07 23:26:02,Twokinds,I'm considering hiring someone else to mow the lawn this year.
410,2019-01-07 23:26:08,Twokinds,It's just not worth my time.
420,2019-01-07 23:33:17,Twokinds,I wonder what the neighbors would say if I got a lizard statue for my yard.
422,2019-01-07 23:33:48,Twokinds,Yeah.

42,2019-01-09 14:24:26,Twokinds,Okay just curious
43,2019-01-09 14:24:43,Twokinds,I was hoping I could use more iconography than just an acron to associate with Mrs Nibbly
44,2019-01-09 14:24:49,Twokinds,But I can't think of anything else.
49,2019-01-09 14:39:39,Twokinds,She is just a completely normal squirrel.
53,2019-01-09 14:57:06,Twokinds,I bet I could make one.
54,2019-01-09 14:58:22,Twokinds,A completely sealed container. Birdseed can't come out at all.
58,2019-01-09 15:01:51,Twokinds,A solid ball of steel. There's no inside at all.
62,2019-01-09 15:02:42,Twokinds,A solid sphere of air. There's no birdfeeder at all.
68,2019-01-09 15:08:58,Twokinds,I just have squirrel feeders that birds steal from.
74,2019-01-09 15:56:12,Twokinds,New Years Resolution going strong.

922,2019-01-10 22:43:48,Twokinds,Hopefully getting more sleep will help

970,2019-01-10 22:46:41,Twokinds,But I don't think you're supposed to bath in it.
982,2019-01-10 22:47:15,Twokinds,I'm going to stick around a little
985,2019-01-10 22:47:27,Twokinds,"Well, I'm going to get some meds"

163,2019-01-11 11:17:11,Twokinds,That seems way too expensive to do.
170,2019-01-11 11:37:32,Twokinds,Well that's the pain of being a one-man team
177,2019-01-11 11:43:28,Twokinds,I've heard of that but I don't trust a third party like that

264,2019-01-13 12:28:37,Twokinds,That's true.
265,2019-01-13 12:29:06,Twokinds,Usually when it's a Nora Card and I forget to also include the original suggester.
266,2019-01-13 12:29:26,Twokinds,"But for sketches, I don't think I've ever forgotten."
272,2019-01-13 12:47:45,Twokinds,That's because iliar asked me to add a second name only when I was coloring it.
273,2019-01-13 12:47:57,Twokinds,I didn't have the other name when I was sketching it.
300,2019-01-13 13:01:58,Twokinds,Man maybe I'm not as recovered as I thought

116,2019-01-14 16:22:51,Twokinds,I'll be a young 74 years old!

142,2019-01-14 16:28:30,Twokinds,It could happen!

230,2019-01-14 19:39:19,Twokinds,"Money has different buying power in the Twokinds world that makes it hard to be directly equivalent to our money, but a gold coin is essentially like a 100 dollar bill, I suppose."
237,2019-01-14 19:47:03,Twokinds,300 gold coins is the average price of a small house.
243,2019-01-14 19:52:00,Twokinds,"Yes but it would have in 1900, in equivalent today's dollars. You have to remmeber that these aren't modern homes, with wiring, advanced materials or insulation."
246,2019-01-14 19:53:00,Twokinds,"That's why I say, it's hard to directly compare the dollar to the buying power."
247,2019-01-14 19:53:11,Twokinds,Because our costs today have changed so much.
250,2019-01-14 19:54:28,Twokinds,"But essentially, for an average Twokinds citizen, a gold coin is a little more than 1 month of mortgage, factoring in a 30 year 300g home."
251,2019-01-14 19:54:37,Twokinds,"Not counting taxes and interest, of course."
257,2019-01-14 19:55:32,Twokinds,Oi Robit
259,2019-01-14 19:55:50,Twokinds,"I don't know. I imaigne, though, that's what a lot of people would do."
260,2019-01-14 19:56:01,Twokinds,Probably just the material costs.
267,2019-01-14 19:58:16,Twokinds,"Looking at prices for houses in the Sears cataloge, some house kits could be bought for 600 dollars in 1908, which is the equivilent of $17,936 in today's money."
270,2019-01-14 19:58:35,Twokinds,"So, it would vary, but I imagine building it yourself would be something like 200 gold, + time."
276,2019-01-14 20:01:39,Twokinds,Some luxery manors you could buy back then cost a whopping $8000!
279,2019-01-14 20:02:00,Twokinds,"Which would be 240,000 in today's money."
280,2019-01-14 20:02:12,Twokinds,And they are biiig houses.
281,2019-01-14 20:02:27,Twokinds,So that'd be like 2000 gold houses in the Twokinds world.
282,2019-01-14 20:03:06,Twokinds,Or 2500 gold houses.
283,2019-01-14 20:03:23,Twokinds,That's a rich person.
287,2019-01-14 20:05:12,Twokinds,lol

289,2019-01-14 20:05:47,Twokinds,Trace's manor is definitely not a 2500g manor.
293,2019-01-14 20:06:07,Twokinds,More like 250000g manor.
300,2019-01-14 20:07:28,Twokinds,"For the average person, who thinks 300g is a ton of money, it's an unthinkable amount."
303,2019-01-14 20:07:59,Twokinds,I generally tried to make each gold piece hold a lot of value.
304,2019-01-14 20:08:41,Twokinds,Because bronze and sometimes silver is what most people are stuck using in day to day.
312,2019-01-14 20:12:47,Twokinds,Copper is 1c. Silver is 100c. Gold is 1000c.
314,2019-01-14 20:13:38,Twokinds,1 copper piece will buy you one candy bar. 1 gold piece will buy you 1000 CANDY BARS!

56,2019-01-15 13:20:55,Twokinds,Probably.
67,2019-01-15 13:26:38,Twokinds,"Right now, it's at 20 pages"
68,2019-01-15 13:26:43,Twokinds,I suspect it'll be 24 pages
69,2019-01-15 13:26:50,Twokinds,Same size as PPP and TDM
72,2019-01-15 13:27:16,Twokinds,I also have smaller ones planned.
74,2019-01-15 13:27:24,Twokinds,Just a few pages.
77,2019-01-15 13:27:45,Twokinds,I'll probably put those together into a print collection.

100,2019-01-15 13:31:07,Twokinds,Some of the ideas I have don't feature any TK characters at all. Though I'm not sure how well they'll be received.
102,2019-01-15 13:31:15,Twokinds,I'm not sure if people are expecting them to all by TK related.
115,2019-01-15 13:34:10,Twokinds,pff who likes that comic anyway
118,2019-01-15 13:34:23,Twokinds,A comic about a guy and his tiger? Ridiculous.
124,2019-01-15 13:35:01,Twokinds,I dunno
126,2019-01-15 13:35:26,Twokinds,I think there was a sketch suggestion once for a calvin and hobbes sledding panel but instead featuring Flora and Trace
127,2019-01-15 13:35:30,Twokinds,But it wasn't picked
138,2019-01-15 13:37:20,Twokinds,C&H is definitely great.

1815,2019-01-15 21:28:20,Twokinds,Now I'm stuck waiting for Photoshop to load.
1823,2019-01-15 21:28:40,Twokinds,I accidentally used the smudge tool instead of the brush tool

2125,2019-01-15 21:56:35,Twokinds,Yeah I figured he'd be deceptively agile for a stone statue
2126,2019-01-15 21:56:37,Twokinds,Since he's a lizard

108,2019-01-17 11:35:24,Twokinds,Why half my characters wear turtlenecks lol
120,2019-01-17 11:37:08,Twokinds,Yes that makes it way easier
123,2019-01-17 11:38:59,Twokinds,"Except I also hate drawing legs, especially when they're just standing around. Which is why I also draw a lot of people wearing robes. No legs. No arms too, if I'm feeling lazy lol"

214,2019-01-17 12:24:37,Twokinds,The room I want to get it into is unfortunately the farthest point in the house away from the router.

2084,2019-01-17 22:02:58,Twokinds,They're small on purpose
2087,2019-01-17 22:03:16,Twokinds,I also draw them with a sharpie so I literally CAN'T add detail

306,2019-01-18 01:50:49,Twokinds,"And it doesn't stop the effects of direct magic usage, like the damage happens to all Basitins that try to use magic."

526,2019-01-18 12:13:44,Twokinds,I'll consider it
529,2019-01-18 12:19:18,Twokinds,Oh
531,2019-01-18 12:19:32,Twokinds,I clarified because I didn't want it to be ambiguous
534,2019-01-18 12:20:06,Twokinds,"I've had people try to write their suggestions one way, then try to secretly get me to draw something else instead."

551,2019-01-18 12:30:50,Twokinds,"Put suggestion worded carefully in quotes, then below it clarify they want something else"

2422,2019-01-19 18:45:59,Twokinds,It would require too much trial and error for a stream.

2728,2019-01-19 19:12:46,Twokinds,Euchre is a pretty big wolf

3084,2019-01-19 19:52:58,Twokinds,Whi?
3268,2019-01-19 20:08:40,Twokinds,Done
3403,2019-01-19 20:19:16,Twokinds,It was proto-twokinds
3404,2019-01-19 20:19:26,Twokinds,it has proto-maren and karen
3405,2019-01-19 20:19:34,Twokinds,And the main character was a proto-Raine
3463,2019-01-19 20:33:24,Twokinds,I don't think it would have lasted nearly as long
3494,2019-01-19 20:37:26,Twokinds,I had three comics that came close to being made
3499,2019-01-19 20:37:36,Twokinds,"This one, Twokinds, and a third called Spirittail"
3501,2019-01-19 20:37:43,Twokinds,I don't know
3533,2019-01-19 20:40:55,Twokinds,SpiritTail was a comic about a girl born with the ability to move her spirit outside of her body.
3555,2019-01-19 20:43:58,Twokinds,"The story would have revolved around a cat spirit that decides to inhabits her body while she's outside of it. Then, it would have been a race to exercise the spirit, while it slowly turned her into a cat."
3556,2019-01-19 20:44:11,Twokinds,lol
3569,2019-01-19 20:45:05,Twokinds,"Well, because it's also slowly taking her over. And every time she uses her ability, it leaves the cat to take her body for a joyride."
3582,2019-01-19 20:46:29,Twokinds,"It just starts out as a dumb cat, but I probably would have had it slowly become more human too, and eventually the two of them working together."

3772,2019-01-19 21:01:01,Twokinds,Done

3970,2019-01-19 21:10:01,Twokinds,I always liked Windstraw as a concept
3971,2019-01-19 21:10:06,Twokinds,Yeah she's one of the Cat Clan
3977,2019-01-19 21:10:26,Twokinds,These are oooold
3978,2019-01-19 21:10:31,Twokinds,I could draw her much better now
4008,2019-01-19 21:11:57,Twokinds,The main character of the series
4016,2019-01-19 21:12:23,Twokinds,The human who crashlands in a world of animal people
4034,2019-01-19 21:13:16,Twokinds,lol
4040,2019-01-19 21:13:29,Twokinds,Unfortunately Riftwall is pretty far back on the backburner
4043,2019-01-19 21:13:43,Twokinds,I just couldn't come up with a compelling story
4422,2019-01-19 21:47:58,Twokinds,Done

4534,2019-01-19 21:54:23,Twokinds,Because Raine is howling
4539,2019-01-19 21:54:39,Twokinds,It sounds like a very high pitched howl
4629,2019-01-19 21:59:03,Twokinds,And that's it for this week

155,2019-01-22 15:23:59,Twokinds,"Of course, off-panel, she probably would have inevitably encountered flora or kat roaming the ship at some point, but I've never actually drawn her reacting to such a thing."
156,2019-01-22 15:25:04,Twokinds,roaming naked*
160,2019-01-22 15:32:22,Twokinds,I said that.
161,2019-01-22 15:32:42,Twokinds,All I'm saying is I've never drawn how she reacts to it.

174,2019-01-22 16:16:35,Twokinds,"Well, I don't play a lot of them."
190,2019-01-22 16:48:55,Twokinds,not so far
194,2019-01-22 16:49:36,Twokinds,Well I don't know what it was
198,2019-01-22 16:50:37,Twokinds,Well is it a secret?
201,2019-01-22 16:51:11,Twokinds,Well then why won't you tell me what it is
208,2019-01-22 16:54:20,Twokinds,"""Has any of you"" is gramatically correct."
210,2019-01-22 16:55:01,Twokinds,I would.
212,2019-01-22 16:55:14,Twokinds,"And if I would use that phrase, than someone like Mike certainly would."
218,2019-01-22 16:58:04,Twokinds,I am aware
221,2019-01-22 16:58:45,Twokinds,"But again, I wouldn't think this much about it. And I feel like an uneducated sailor wouldn't either."

225,2019-01-22 16:59:21,Twokinds,Even though I don't think it's a big deal.

111,2019-01-25 00:21:32,Twokinds,I tried making two pages out of this
114,2019-01-25 00:21:54,Twokinds,But then the pacing was off because the scene had to be stretched over a lot more
122,2019-01-25 00:23:08,Twokinds,It's not enough to fill two pages
126,2019-01-25 00:23:20,Twokinds,"And I don't do extra long pages, those are always double pages."

4887,2019-02-02 23:56:19,Twokinds,There must have been a period of time when I just wanted in the habit of mirroring Patreon color art to dA
4888,2019-02-02 23:56:56,Twokinds,I guess that's one good thing about Patreon's shenanigans. It got me to pay more attention to mirroring the color art.
4890,2019-02-02 23:58:07,Twokinds,lol thanks
4891,2019-02-02 23:58:14,Twokinds,I just set it to post a picture every hour
5,2019-02-03 00:01:56,Twokinds,"I didn't stop, I forgot"
9,2019-02-03 00:02:12,Twokinds,"And, uh... I don't think I have dice."
16,2019-02-03 00:03:41,Twokinds,We had a really cool fight last session
17,2019-02-03 00:03:47,Twokinds,Lasted the entire game night
22,2019-02-03 00:04:42,Twokinds,It was basically our part of four v another party of adventurers. All very high level
26,2019-02-03 00:05:30,Twokinds,I'm not sure
27,2019-02-03 00:05:32,Twokinds,Maybe
28,2019-02-03 00:05:44,Twokinds,It took a lot out of us though.
31,2019-02-03 00:05:53,Twokinds,They were pulling out stuff like time stop
36,2019-02-03 00:06:10,Twokinds,Right off the bat their mage got five turns in one round
40,2019-02-03 00:06:38,Twokinds,"No, Time Stop"
44,2019-02-03 00:07:21,Twokinds,yeah we're playing 5e
49,2019-02-03 00:07:55,Twokinds,Time Stop is a 9th lvl spell that lets you take 1d4+1 turns in a row
54,2019-02-03 00:08:25,Twokinds,21
60,2019-02-03 00:09:10,Twokinds,We're doing epic levels
63,2019-02-03 00:09:26,Twokinds,"And yeah, it's pretty darn fun being so powerful. It's the first epic level game I've played."
68,2019-02-03 00:10:12,Twokinds,My monk once hitting 21 got an ability that causes her to glow and fly and deal radiant damage on every hit. She basically goes super sayan.
74,2019-02-03 00:11:05,Twokinds,That's going to be my next one XD The one that lets me punch people at range
75,2019-02-03 00:11:08,Twokinds,With ki
79,2019-02-03 00:11:43,Twokinds,Her speed is ridiculous now
82,2019-02-03 00:12:15,Twokinds,Her base speed is 70
86,2019-02-03 00:12:31,Twokinds,We have a bard that does haste buffs and an alchemist that makes potions of speed.
87,2019-02-03 00:12:41,Twokinds,"And she's a monk, so she can use ki to double that speed."
105,2019-02-03 00:15:14,Twokinds,halfling
124,2019-02-03 00:17:53,Twokinds,no it's 5 ft
125,2019-02-03 00:18:01,Twokinds,Oh
126,2019-02-03 00:18:08,Twokinds,Each square is 5 ft sorry
127,2019-02-03 00:18:13,Twokinds,yeah the speed units are ft
137,2019-02-03 00:20:01,Twokinds,"Base speed 70 +70 haste, +40 potion, +180 dash, +180 step of the wind."
148,2019-02-03 00:21:42,Twokinds,So 90 ft / sec or about 30 m / s
151,2019-02-03 00:22:18,Twokinds,lol
153,2019-02-03 00:22:32,Twokinds,Their wizard also has other tricks
155,2019-02-03 00:22:41,Twokinds,He was using a duplicit
161,2019-02-03 00:23:42,Twokinds,"And the real one was protected by an Invulnerability spell, which made him immune to all damage until it ended."
164,2019-02-03 00:24:22,Twokinds,Yeah buffed and layed out delayed fireball mines
167,2019-02-03 00:24:55,Twokinds,It was a great fight
171,2019-02-03 00:25:07,Twokinds,I ended up killing the real wizard in one punch ^^
176,2019-02-03 00:25:34,Twokinds,And I punched him through his invunerability spell
181,2019-02-03 00:26:14,Twokinds,I couldn't damage him at all
182,2019-02-03 00:26:18,Twokinds,While he was invunerable
183,2019-02-03 00:26:21,Twokinds,But I didn't need to
184,2019-02-03 00:26:31,Twokinds,I used Quivering Palm
189,2019-02-03 00:27:32,Twokinds,"The moment the shield was dispelled, snapped my finger and bam, he failed the roll and HP went immediately to 0."
192,2019-02-03 00:27:56,Twokinds,It totally is!
194,2019-02-03 00:28:12,Twokinds,I mean he was a spellcaster
196,2019-02-03 00:28:22,Twokinds,Pretty much
197,2019-02-03 00:28:32,Twokinds,"Well, I gave him a heart attack, not turned him to dust."
204,2019-02-03 00:29:33,Twokinds,"Anyway, it was a blast. Their cleric was summoning high level angels after us. They were a problem."
206,2019-02-03 00:30:05,Twokinds,lol no
208,2019-02-03 00:30:11,Twokinds,UNFORTUNATELY
213,2019-02-03 00:30:25,Twokinds,Our big spellcaster was blinded right at the very beginning of the fight
217,2019-02-03 00:30:47,Twokinds,"Then blindly tried to take a potion to cure it, turned out to be the wrong potion, ended up in the astral plane instead"
219,2019-02-03 00:30:51,Twokinds,Completely missed the entire fight
228,2019-02-03 00:31:38,Twokinds,"It's okay. That was our missing player of the week, Fluff. He was at a wedding, so he was being piloted by Sage."
233,2019-02-03 00:32:09,Twokinds,lol yeah scrambling blindly in the wrong dimension.
235,2019-02-03 00:32:24,Twokinds,He didn't even know what was happening.
240,2019-02-03 00:33:39,Twokinds,He just KEPT FAILING his roll to save v blind
242,2019-02-03 00:33:47,Twokinds,The entire fight
245,2019-02-03 00:34:10,Twokinds,The bard was the real hero
251,2019-02-03 00:34:34,Twokinds,His debuffs screwed the other party
253,2019-02-03 00:35:18,Twokinds,"Telling jokes making them laugh so they kept losing their turn, slowing them, stunning them."
257,2019-02-03 00:35:50,Twokinds,lol
258,2019-02-03 00:35:51,Twokinds,No
259,2019-02-03 00:35:57,Twokinds,Unfortunately not
262,2019-02-03 00:36:09,Twokinds,Oh yeah and Mihari was also a big help
264,2019-02-03 00:36:30,Twokinds,I took a huge amount of damage right off the bat due to a sneak attack first round.
266,2019-02-03 00:36:47,Twokinds,"She's the alchemist that makes potions, but she also has the shield and the healing."
267,2019-02-03 00:36:57,Twokinds,So my monk hid behind her shield a LOT.
269,2019-02-03 00:37:28,Twokinds,SURPRISE ROUND
271,2019-02-03 00:37:45,Twokinds,Took half my life
275,2019-02-03 00:38:25,Twokinds,"But outside of that, I was prioritizing flurries and stunning strikes to patient defense"
276,2019-02-03 00:38:39,Twokinds,My character is a hot head and prefers to go fast to being patient
280,2019-02-03 00:39:18,Twokinds,Gotta go fast
286,2019-02-03 00:43:27,Twokinds,Indeed!
289,2019-02-03 00:43:49,Twokinds,Thank goodness I am a monk. I really needed those dex saves
290,2019-02-03 00:43:54,Twokinds,BYE Rima!
298,2019-02-03 00:44:58,Twokinds,lol!
299,2019-02-03 00:45:05,Twokinds,Just don't get hit
302,2019-02-03 00:45:33,Twokinds,That's my monk's weakness. A couple hits and she's out.

413,2019-02-03 13:04:48,Twokinds,Sigh
416,2019-02-03 13:11:08,Twokinds,Sometimes I suspect people use sketch suggestions just to get me to draw new characters and sneak around the no OC rule.
417,2019-02-03 13:11:32,Twokinds,"""Draw me a cheetah... no, an ORIGINAL cheetah. Or OC for short."""
419,2019-02-03 13:14:48,Twokinds,Not the point.
450,2019-02-03 13:33:42,Twokinds,"Of course, the easiest way to get me to draw OCs is to start a webcomic and get me to draw fanart for it XD"
451,2019-02-03 13:33:50,Twokinds,Loophole!
453,2019-02-03 13:35:11,Twokinds,lol yeah not exactly the easy way.

1529,2019-02-08 17:44:17,Twokinds,And I use a Soft Light layer to give color to the lighted areas using a very light orange

1565,2019-02-08 17:56:19,Twokinds,Like during a big moment or at the end of an episode or something XD

719,2019-02-10 16:20:43,Twokinds,in the Twokinds world it's sort of an unwritten understanding that relations happen all the time.
720,2019-02-10 16:20:51,Twokinds,But you're not supposed to say it.
722,2019-02-10 16:21:19,Twokinds,"And it's not really seen as true romance or anything. No one considers it love, and if they did, that'd be considered immoral."

748,2019-02-10 16:42:31,Twokinds,I have to wait until it grows out more.

753,2019-02-10 16:43:31,Twokinds,But I can't clip it off because it's too deep.

77,2019-02-12 15:30:00,Twokinds,MarshallMelon
79,2019-02-12 15:32:16,Twokinds,I don't know that one
82,2019-02-12 15:36:33,Twokinds,That one's not on the list.
84,2019-02-12 15:39:59,Twokinds,What iliar does is helpful. It's just a google doc with the cards you want organized by month.
85,2019-02-12 15:40:09,Twokinds,"Not saying you have to do that, just that a list is handy."
87,2019-02-12 15:40:49,Twokinds,The problem is you add things out of order
88,2019-02-12 15:41:02,Twokinds,And I can't tell how many cards have been fulfilled
92,2019-02-12 15:42:12,Twokinds,"When you have your updated list, message me with it on Patreon."
102,2019-02-12 16:01:52,Twokinds,"I mean, you can tell me which one you want to do first, but I'd like them listed by month."
103,2019-02-12 16:02:12,Twokinds,Just organize them by month and then put a number by which one you want me to get to next.
106,2019-02-12 16:04:04,Twokinds,Message me on Patreon
12,2019-02-13 00:36:14,Twokinds,I can't have too much sugar.

505,2019-02-14 21:52:12,Twokinds,I have them both on Airplane mode so I don't receive any calls.
571,2019-02-14 21:58:51,Twokinds,I would never spend money on cosmetics.
572,2019-02-14 21:58:54,Twokinds,Or anything in any game.
580,2019-02-14 21:59:15,Twokinds,I don't like spending money.

1012,2019-02-14 22:56:01,Twokinds,"Well if I run out of three months, then something really bad is happening."
1014,2019-02-14 22:56:29,Twokinds,"So then I'd have to start on the emergency rations, which would last about another two months."
1023,2019-02-14 22:57:27,Twokinds,XD By then I'd hope to have a farm or another source. Or just be a zombie haha
1028,2019-02-14 22:58:29,Twokinds,lol

864,2019-02-15 16:24:27,Twokinds,I still use it sometimes on the rare occassion I do have to implement something.

339,2019-02-19 19:00:20,Twokinds,Indeed
359,2019-02-19 19:07:40,Twokinds,Bye!
362,2019-02-19 19:08:02,Twokinds,One of Reni's biggest fears is that she's going to end up conceited like other dragons when she gets older.
374,2019-02-19 19:12:52,Twokinds,She's a black-scaled dragon which pretty much means she's destined for evil.
392,2019-02-19 19:23:40,Twokinds,Mrs Nibbly's tail is annoying
393,2019-02-19 19:23:53,Twokinds,It's so big it's impossible to get her all in frame half the time
400,2019-02-19 19:24:29,Twokinds,It's like as big as she is!
438,2019-02-19 19:39:20,Twokinds,Yeah
450,2019-02-19 19:44:47,Twokinds,I'm pretty good at drawing food so I think I could draw origami.
32,2019-02-20 00:38:51,Twokinds,Dragons do help with making gold.
33,2019-02-20 00:38:59,Twokinds,They are dragon poop.
38,2019-02-20 00:39:22,Twokinds,Makes you see the hobbit in a new light.

75,2019-02-20 02:27:22,Twokinds,Or I'm getting there.
77,2019-02-20 02:27:40,Twokinds,"You know, I just realized all of Trace's love interested were felines."
78,2019-02-20 02:28:10,Twokinds,Saria is a lion. Maren is a black cat. Flora is a Tiger.
84,2019-02-20 02:29:25,Twokinds,It's true.
87,2019-02-20 02:31:58,Twokinds,I wonder what Reni's animal form would be.
89,2019-02-20 02:32:58,Twokinds,I mean all dragons in the Twokinds universe can shapeshift into most animals. But they all have favorites.
90,2019-02-20 02:33:44,Twokinds,It'd have to be something black
91,2019-02-20 02:33:47,Twokinds,Perhaps just a black cat
92,2019-02-20 02:34:31,Twokinds,"Or maybe a black dog. Although, for Reni dog doesn't really feel suitable to her personality."
94,2019-02-20 02:35:51,Twokinds,no
97,2019-02-20 02:36:42,Twokinds,That's neat
110,2019-02-20 02:48:17,Twokinds,Yes I cannot stand noise
111,2019-02-20 02:48:24,Twokinds,So I could never have a bird
115,2019-02-20 02:51:11,Twokinds,Thanks
116,2019-02-20 02:51:37,Twokinds,It's kinda weird to draw her like that.
120,2019-02-20 02:57:14,Twokinds,Time to try for bed again.

53,2019-02-21 13:24:08,Twokinds,I finished that on the stream a few days ago.
64,2019-02-21 13:41:21,Twokinds,"Oh right, that's. I dunno."

306,2019-02-21 20:47:40,Twokinds,I plan to work on it Monday.
308,2019-02-21 20:47:59,Twokinds,A little.
351,2019-02-21 21:02:27,Twokinds,no
353,2019-02-21 21:02:38,Twokinds,Obviously ko was referring to the stock symbol for coca-cola and my plans to purchase shares in the company.
546,2019-02-21 21:32:13,Twokinds,That was hollow knight actually
548,2019-02-21 21:32:20,Twokinds,From the Grimm Troupe DLC
556,2019-02-21 21:33:20,Twokinds,It's one of my favorites from the game
557,2019-02-21 21:33:26,Twokinds,Though a lot of the boss fights are really good
564,2019-02-21 21:34:59,Twokinds,It's legit one of my top games of the last five years
565,2019-02-21 21:35:22,Twokinds,Uh... I wouldn't say so
589,2019-02-21 21:38:53,Twokinds,Yeah I have it on steam
591,2019-02-21 21:38:59,Twokinds,It can be challenging
601,2019-02-21 21:39:36,Twokinds,Man... the Path of Pain is killer
605,2019-02-21 21:39:57,Twokinds,yes
607,2019-02-21 21:40:22,Twokinds,"Weirdly, Hollow Knight is the kind of game where a boss can seem really, really hard when you first get to him."
609,2019-02-21 21:40:43,Twokinds,"But then you come back after 20 hours of experience, and replaying it, you think ""wow, was this boss always so slow?"""
633,2019-02-21 21:42:46,Twokinds,Yeah

33,2019-03-05 13:44:01,Twokinds,"I mean, unless there's a really good one out there I'm missing."
34,2019-03-05 13:44:06,Twokinds,I am willing to take suggestions XD
36,2019-03-05 13:46:36,Twokinds,I am hoping not to spend $500+ dollars if I can avoid it.
41,2019-03-05 13:56:35,Twokinds,"Well, anything is probably better than using my wacom tablet as a gaming monitor"
42,2019-03-05 13:56:44,Twokinds,With it's response time of 12ms
47,2019-03-05 14:08:09,Twokinds,I'm not all that picky either
48,2019-03-05 14:08:31,Twokinds,"But if given the choice, I would like to make sure the monitor I ultimately do get for my new PC is at least not garbage XD"

52,2019-03-05 14:11:24,Twokinds,"Well of course, but I already have that with my Cintiq."
53,2019-03-05 14:11:43,Twokinds,Right now my second monitor is very bad
55,2019-03-05 14:12:05,Twokinds,"It's an old monitor, with 72% color gamut"
56,2019-03-05 14:12:38,Twokinds,"I actually like to use it for art, to see what people with crappy monitors see when they view my work XD"
73,2019-03-05 14:32:25,Twokinds,It does seem like a good deal
74,2019-03-05 14:32:35,Twokinds,The only issue is that it's a TN penl display rather than IPS
77,2019-03-05 14:34:44,Twokinds,"Yeah it doesn't say it anywhere on the amazon page, so I had to look it up."
78,2019-03-05 14:35:07,Twokinds,"Still, for almost 200 dollars less, it's a good deal."

1354,2019-03-14 23:24:52,Twokinds,I went to college but I never interacted with anyone
1363,2019-03-14 23:25:28,Twokinds,I just went to my 2 classes each week and then went home.
1367,2019-03-14 23:25:50,Twokinds,Yeah
1370,2019-03-14 23:26:02,Twokinds,I always had 2 3-hour classes each week.
1375,2019-03-14 23:26:25,Twokinds,And that's all I did. XD Most of them were at night too so the place was mostly empty.
1378,2019-03-14 23:26:47,Twokinds,Oh yeah they were the best
1379,2019-03-14 23:26:52,Twokinds,Very few people
1452,2019-03-14 23:34:26,Twokinds,Modern settings are so hard for me
1455,2019-03-14 23:34:36,Twokinds,I don't know anything about what people wear
1460,2019-03-14 23:34:52,Twokinds,NEVER
1624,2019-03-14 23:54:44,Twokinds,Probably
46,2019-03-15 00:06:33,Twokinds,"My only experience with college: People drinking coffee, running, and carrying lots of stuff"

424,2019-03-15 11:33:24,Twokinds,"I had a crazy number of dreams last night. Felt like I didn't sleep at all, just constant dreams."
426,2019-03-15 11:34:23,Twokinds,It didn't feel like sleeping.
427,2019-03-15 11:34:34,Twokinds,Most of the dreams were about how tired I was.
429,2019-03-15 11:34:43,Twokinds,I had one where I hadn't slept in 3 days.
431,2019-03-15 11:35:52,Twokinds,Also the fact that people remember dreams because they're waking up repeatedly.
432,2019-03-15 11:35:59,Twokinds,It wasn't exactly the best night's sleep.
435,2019-03-15 11:37:09,Twokinds,No I can't stand naps. Makes me feel awful.
439,2019-03-15 11:44:48,Twokinds,That's what I don't do all the time!
559,2019-03-15 15:42:00,Twokinds,Cookin soup!
562,2019-03-15 15:42:23,Twokinds,Dad's old recipe

568,2019-03-15 15:43:12,Twokinds,It's still got another hour and a half to go.
571,2019-03-15 15:43:45,Twokinds,Yup! Simmers for 3 hours
627,2019-03-15 17:30:12,Twokinds,Soup's done!
630,2019-03-15 17:33:19,Twokinds,"It's a beef soup, with carrots and potatoes. My dad's old recipe."
631,2019-03-15 17:33:23,Twokinds,It's so good!
634,2019-03-15 17:33:43,Twokinds,"This is probably the best one I've made in a while. Basic, but hearty."
639,2019-03-15 17:37:42,Twokinds,It's even better later. After a few days it basically turns into stew.
644,2019-03-15 17:38:22,Twokinds,The wedding one?
649,2019-03-15 17:40:36,Twokinds,Hmmm...
650,2019-03-15 17:41:07,Twokinds,"I already plan to color all the pages eventually, but I could make a full-effort version of that panel"
651,2019-03-15 17:41:37,Twokinds,"If it's okay that I can use the full version for that panel in the final comic, then I'd say it's okay."
656,2019-03-15 17:44:54,Twokinds,Good night!
657,2019-03-15 17:45:12,Twokinds,"You'll see it soon enough, Bgr!"
658,2019-03-15 17:45:22,Twokinds,"iliar: Then yes, that's fine."
10,2019-03-16 10:40:48,Twokinds,Aaaaand it's snowing outside. The weather truly can't make up its mind.

138,2019-03-16 15:08:03,Twokinds,Let us get started.
309,2019-03-16 15:38:15,Twokinds,I actually can't decide on what Trace would do that would be impressive XD
801,2019-03-16 16:25:41,Twokinds,Done
842,2019-03-16 16:29:45,Twokinds,I had to get a drink
859,2019-03-16 16:31:13,Twokinds,"Trace was attempting to stop time. He doesn't even come close, because it's practically impossible, but time is slowed by a tiny fraction of a second, enough for Nora it sense it and wake up"
930,2019-03-16 16:38:27,Twokinds,The snap would just bring her back
947,2019-03-16 16:40:41,Twokinds,lol
951,2019-03-16 16:40:59,Twokinds,Yes Kat had undiagnosed poor eyesight
954,2019-03-16 16:41:24,Twokinds,She see's Eric as a potential love interest
1030,2019-03-16 16:50:03,Twokinds,Default Laura is manlier than Mike
1081,2019-03-16 16:56:23,Twokinds,Laurence looks like a surfer dude

1463,2019-03-16 17:36:59,Twokinds,Well there are only so many characters
1486,2019-03-16 17:38:25,Twokinds,"As far as trends go, I don't mind the character sheets as much"
1521,2019-03-16 17:40:57,Twokinds,I won't name names
1522,2019-03-16 17:40:58,Twokinds,lol
1525,2019-03-16 17:41:14,Twokinds,But some people sure do like to bandwagon
1597,2019-03-16 17:50:14,Twokinds,Laura is the definition of petite
1599,2019-03-16 17:50:21,Twokinds,"But she's never minded it, unlike Flora."
1649,2019-03-16 17:55:54,Twokinds,Yeah Laura can't do magic
1796,2019-03-16 18:10:30,Twokinds,"Char sheets are hard because you not only have to try and not cover as much as possible, but also show their personality in the way they stand."
1798,2019-03-16 18:10:44,Twokinds,But just showing personality while standing still is difficult sometimes. XD
1834,2019-03-16 18:13:09,Twokinds,Who would be the others
2056,2019-03-16 18:30:27,Twokinds,Thanks

2307,2019-03-16 18:48:55,Twokinds,But she's listed as 1.66 on the sketch body side chart
2354,2019-03-16 18:51:46,Twokinds,Fixed
2372,2019-03-16 18:52:22,Twokinds,Laura's height changed ever so slightly over the course of her lifetime
2374,2019-03-16 18:52:26,Twokinds,And also becoming a ghost

3259,2019-03-16 20:13:51,Twokinds,I can relate to being flat

91,2019-03-17 16:18:59,Twokinds,"It might have also been some other reason, though I usually try to message people beforehand if their suggestion is not appropriate, a spoiler, or some reason why I can't draw it."

15,2019-03-18 11:39:25,Twokinds,Did patreon change something again?
18,2019-03-18 11:46:48,Twokinds,I guess?
20,2019-03-18 11:51:21,Twokinds,I see. So they're upping their price fee. Wonderful...
21,2019-03-18 11:53:51,Twokinds,Prices will stay the same for me for now. Wonder how long though.
23,2019-03-18 11:57:06,Twokinds,I'm not sure why Patreon needs more than 5%.
24,2019-03-18 11:59:50,Twokinds,"I can understand offering premium services, but taking out stuff they already offer like membership tiers and making those require 8% from now on... seems like they just want a bigger cut."

71,2019-03-18 14:11:12,Twokinds,Nothing to put it in yet.
72,2019-03-18 14:11:15,Twokinds,But it's a lot!
96,2019-03-18 15:02:49,Twokinds,You mean Nurse Kat? It's not age gated as far as I can tell.
110,2019-03-18 15:15:20,Twokinds,I remember Inuyasha
138,2019-03-18 15:32:29,Twokinds,Next to nothing

166,2019-03-18 16:28:24,Twokinds,I bought some flowers and gifts for my mom for her birthday tomorrow... but now I'm second guessing whether her birthday really is tomorrow or not.
167,2019-03-18 16:28:50,Twokinds,I'm not sure. I think it is.

217,2019-03-18 18:19:04,Twokinds,"Hopefully, writer's block will not be a problem for a while now."
222,2019-03-18 18:24:53,Twokinds,Yeah it took a lot of effort to get it all sorted out.
223,2019-03-18 18:25:02,Twokinds,I think I have a good idea now how to get it going.
225,2019-03-18 18:25:09,Twokinds,I'll try to make up for lost time.
226,2019-03-18 18:25:13,Twokinds,No promises.

41,2019-03-19 10:32:43,Twokinds,"That is my plan for today, anyway."
50,2019-03-19 10:43:06,Twokinds,I keep getting mental characteristics and personality mixed up
51,2019-03-19 10:43:31,Twokinds,"Obviously one is what someone knows and what skills they have, while the other is how they act. But sometimes there is overlap."
52,2019-03-19 10:47:42,Twokinds,"Is kindness a mental characteristic or a personality trait? A person can act kind, but they can also be naturally inclinded to be kind."
70,2019-03-19 12:42:20,Twokinds,I'm not sure if I should add the lore about ghosts to Laura's character sheet.
71,2019-03-19 12:42:57,Twokinds,"Probably not, it might make people think Laura's showing up again as a character, which is not the case for the mainline comic."
72,2019-03-19 12:43:20,Twokinds,Though I might use ghost laura in a magical mishap side comic one day.
73,2019-03-19 12:43:27,Twokinds,That's the side comic canon though.
74,2019-03-19 12:43:36,Twokinds,Where things can be a bit more flexible. XD
119,2019-03-19 14:18:03,Twokinds,"Yeah, fixed"
134,2019-03-19 16:54:31,Twokinds,You mean Karen? XD
167,2019-03-19 19:15:34,Twokinds,"Honestly, I'm realizing now, I probably shouldn't have given Maren and Karen such close names. XD"
168,2019-03-19 19:15:40,Twokinds,But they are minor characters.
172,2019-03-19 19:19:59,Twokinds,"Yeah, I did."
173,2019-03-19 19:20:35,Twokinds,"But for some reason they always get mixed up, probably because they aren't really considered important enough to remember 1 letter difference. XD"
178,2019-03-19 19:22:41,Twokinds,Where in the world is Karmen Taverndatter
199,2019-03-19 19:33:06,Twokinds,Yah Kei's long name is confusing
200,2019-03-19 19:33:36,Twokinds,It's mostly because of Kei & Keidran.
202,2019-03-19 19:34:11,Twokinds,Kei means beast in old human.
205,2019-03-19 19:34:55,Twokinds,Keidran means beast people. Keiren means hunter.
207,2019-03-19 19:35:15,Twokinds,"So, Kei's name is Hunter."
235,2019-03-19 20:03:10,Twokinds,Uh no no name for the explorer people

249,2019-03-19 20:08:47,Twokinds,Yeah
250,2019-03-19 20:09:06,Twokinds,"I mean I'm not sure if it's better or not, but I figure one per hour is probably better than 1 per minute"

252,2019-03-19 20:09:17,Twokinds,I dunno
253,2019-03-19 20:09:36,Twokinds,I could do one per day but then it'd take forever.

123,2019-03-20 13:34:50,Twokinds,Did you guys see the upcoming Zelda / Necrodancer fusion?
124,2019-03-20 13:34:53,Twokinds,I want
173,2019-03-20 13:42:44,Twokinds,Thinking of swords
180,2019-03-20 13:43:15,Twokinds,"No, Raine is a swimsuit"
194,2019-03-20 13:46:58,Twokinds,Survive death? Beach party!
202,2019-03-20 13:48:39,Twokinds,Yeah pretty much
204,2019-03-20 13:48:45,Twokinds,That was the intention of this chapter
205,2019-03-20 13:48:52,Twokinds,"you know, before things explode"
213,2019-03-20 13:49:23,Twokinds,Can't have a beach episode without action and drama
223,2019-03-20 13:51:18,Twokinds,Well character development requires some sort of motivating factor
235,2019-03-20 13:52:56,Twokinds,Indeed
240,2019-03-20 13:53:52,Twokinds,I hadn't considered as such
250,2019-03-20 13:59:56,Twokinds,Yeah all these new clothes are raided from the estate
252,2019-03-20 14:00:34,Twokinds,"So, either Trace, Saria, or one of the servants or guests."
260,2019-03-20 14:03:12,Twokinds,Honestly she probably did insist that
262,2019-03-20 14:03:34,Twokinds,Keidran don't tend to wear anything when swimming. Fur is heavy enough as it is.
263,2019-03-20 14:03:39,Twokinds,Most Keidran can't swim.
266,2019-03-20 14:04:24,Twokinds,For sure
276,2019-03-20 14:09:43,Twokinds,"It's been so long since I've played Dead Money, I don't remember the plot"
400,2019-03-20 14:57:30,Twokinds,Uh... because gaussian blur isn't very useful in shading
403,2019-03-20 14:58:57,Twokinds,Well if it works for you that's great ^^
404,2019-03-20 14:59:16,Twokinds,I prefer to have more specific control over the softness or hardness of shadows
406,2019-03-20 15:00:37,Twokinds,brb Alexa just told me there's something in my mailbox
417,2019-03-20 15:04:14,Twokinds,I am back!
421,2019-03-20 15:04:39,Twokinds,Trash bags.
422,2019-03-20 15:04:41,Twokinds,Box of 100. XD
423,2019-03-20 15:04:44,Twokinds,Exciting stuff.
430,2019-03-20 15:05:03,Twokinds,Yeah. Why not?
434,2019-03-20 15:05:29,Twokinds,"I mean, when I run out, I just say Alexa buy more trash bags and then they just show up eventually."
438,2019-03-20 15:06:08,Twokinds,I love it.
440,2019-03-20 15:06:12,Twokinds,Don't have to lift a finger!
444,2019-03-20 15:06:42,Twokinds,Going to Amazon and buying it is too much work for me now
459,2019-03-20 15:07:43,Twokinds,oh? alright
461,2019-03-20 15:07:45,Twokinds,Sure
463,2019-03-20 15:07:56,Twokinds,I'll check my email later
483,2019-03-20 15:09:23,Twokinds,Actually I don't think I have any email from Picarto
485,2019-03-20 15:09:34,Twokinds,"I have one, from support@picarto, but it's blank"
489,2019-03-20 15:10:22,Twokinds,How long ago was it
495,2019-03-20 15:11:23,Twokinds,Yeah I see just one but it's a totally blank email XD
500,2019-03-20 15:11:51,Twokinds,No problem
503,2019-03-20 15:12:00,Twokinds,Hope it's not bad news...
505,2019-03-20 15:12:03,Twokinds,Now I'm paranoid
517,2019-03-20 15:13:00,Twokinds,Ah I see
569,2019-03-20 15:19:16,Twokinds,Belayed Hiiii Sage!
651,2019-03-20 15:29:26,Twokinds,The right panel is from Raine's perspective
652,2019-03-20 15:29:31,Twokinds,Of course that's not the door she just opened
712,2019-03-20 15:44:45,Twokinds,I've been trying really hard to get better at drawing the human characters
720,2019-03-20 15:46:10,Twokinds,More consistant
721,2019-03-20 15:46:29,Twokinds,Better at different angles. Able to tilt head towards and away from the camera
723,2019-03-20 15:46:53,Twokinds,Well I'm not saying here specifically
726,2019-03-20 15:47:26,Twokinds,Doing skin better
727,2019-03-20 15:47:28,Twokinds,Skin is hard
730,2019-03-20 15:47:36,Twokinds,All that... subsurface skattering
740,2019-03-20 15:48:39,Twokinds,lol
741,2019-03-20 15:48:40,Twokinds,Yeah
742,2019-03-20 15:48:54,Twokinds,And realistic skin doesn't transistion straight from light to shadow
743,2019-03-20 15:49:02,Twokinds,"There's like... colors inbetween, and it's hard to wrap my head around"
756,2019-03-20 15:50:11,Twokinds,yeah I'm doing a lot of research on other artists who are very good at skin tones
761,2019-03-20 15:50:27,Twokinds,"I'm always impressed when an artist can do skin, but also still be stylized"
766,2019-03-20 15:50:51,Twokinds,Like this is really well done
770,2019-03-20 15:51:10,Twokinds,I'm taking a lot of inspiration from this artist
777,2019-03-20 15:52:18,Twokinds,Not that I'd ever put so much effort into a Twokinds comic page XD
778,2019-03-20 15:52:22,Twokinds,4 pages a year if I did
788,2019-03-20 15:54:14,Twokinds,"As always, I will keep trying to do as best I can with the time I have available."
812,2019-03-20 15:59:06,Twokinds,Done!
829,2019-03-20 16:00:01,Twokinds,Congratulations!
830,2019-03-20 16:00:04,Twokinds,"Anyway, gotta go!"
832,2019-03-20 16:00:07,Twokinds,Byyeeee!
23,2019-03-21 11:08:37,Twokinds,morning
28,2019-03-21 11:48:52,Twokinds,20180105 is a bug in my automated Save Twokinds macro
29,2019-03-21 11:49:28,Twokinds,It's not supposed to change the filename but I still need to fix it.
30,2019-03-21 11:55:03,Twokinds,"As for my pc build, here was my goal: https://pcpartpicker.com/list/Ymy6tg"
31,2019-03-21 11:55:22,Twokinds,Although I was also considering an AMD build: https://pcpartpicker.com/list/3k3rbX
35,2019-03-21 12:23:58,Twokinds,"Yes, expensive. More than I'd like it to be, but graphic card prices are insane."
36,2019-03-21 12:25:14,Twokinds,"I already have the case and RAM, both bought on sale."
37,2019-03-21 12:25:30,Twokinds,Just getting them piece by piece as I find good deals. It'll be built eventually.
42,2019-03-21 12:39:14,Twokinds,No prob!
43,2019-03-21 12:39:27,Twokinds,I've been doing a lot of computer part research lately for this build.
44,2019-03-21 12:41:15,Twokinds,"The last time I really got into pc building was 10 years ago, when I built my first one."
122,2019-03-21 20:11:24,Twokinds,Starting in 2 minutes
272,2019-03-21 20:40:14,Twokinds,brb
280,2019-03-21 20:42:03,Twokinds,Back
289,2019-03-21 20:43:27,Twokinds,I think I'm pretty much done with this.
290,2019-03-21 20:43:34,Twokinds,"Very cute, Ron! :D"
303,2019-03-21 20:45:29,Twokinds,It's Sage's character Nyna from Artificial Incident! :D
589,2019-03-21 21:25:57,Twokinds,catdog
689,2019-03-21 21:39:08,Twokinds,Don't you mean they'd never see it coming unsteddy
755,2019-03-21 21:50:49,Twokinds,54G3.com
759,2019-03-21 21:51:24,Twokinds,Darn
836,2019-03-21 22:05:21,Twokinds,Not much
1109,2019-03-21 22:41:55,Twokinds,Hi Lonn!
1621,2019-03-21 23:32:27,Twokinds,I don't see how I could do that
1623,2019-03-21 23:32:42,Twokinds,Since Raine's face shape changes completely between form
1646,2019-03-21 23:36:53,Twokinds,hi
1666,2019-03-21 23:39:18,Twokinds,This panel of raine was driving me crazy
1671,2019-03-21 23:39:37,Twokinds,She's so imbalanced it makes trying to pose her difficult
1674,2019-03-21 23:39:45,Twokinds,And draw her proportionally
61,2019-03-22 00:05:17,Twokinds,Finally done sketching this
102,2019-03-22 00:08:09,Twokinds,Hmmm....
129,2019-03-22 00:11:04,Twokinds,I think I'm done though
142,2019-03-22 00:11:31,Twokinds,Goodnight everyone!
153,2019-03-22 00:11:41,Twokinds,Have a happy March 23
17,2019-03-23 12:18:06,Twokinds,No
30,2019-03-23 12:37:50,Twokinds,I know of Sequential Art. I haven't read it.
34,2019-03-23 12:46:54,Twokinds,I think it's fine
39,2019-03-23 13:01:58,Twokinds,Sure
40,2019-03-23 13:02:50,Twokinds,As long as it is not nsfw content or links to nsfw content.
55,2019-03-23 13:10:43,Twokinds,Yeah duh
56,2019-03-23 13:10:47,Twokinds,Jesus
75,2019-03-23 13:31:59,Twokinds,Oh great there's no way to directly link to AI
76,2019-03-23 13:32:04,Twokinds,At least as far as I can tell
77,2019-03-23 13:32:09,Twokinds,And Mihari and Sage are still asleep
82,2019-03-23 13:32:27,Twokinds,Because of the borked website
83,2019-03-23 13:32:31,Twokinds,I can't believe it still isn't fixed
89,2019-03-23 13:33:09,Twokinds,Less than idea
92,2019-03-23 13:33:15,Twokinds,If I tweet that it'll be outdated in a week
93,2019-03-23 13:33:55,Twokinds,ai.katbox.net forwards to sage.katbox.net which is just the general screen for both comics
94,2019-03-23 13:33:58,Twokinds,I guess whatever
95,2019-03-23 13:33:59,Twokinds,It works
108,2019-03-23 13:55:06,Twokinds,That's a really clunky url
549,2019-03-23 15:29:59,Twokinds,I hate openoffice
551,2019-03-23 15:30:03,Twokinds,There's no easy way to do anything
557,2019-03-23 15:30:42,Twokinds,Not great but let's do this
577,2019-03-23 15:31:39,Twokinds,"tkpolls is undergoing maintainance right now, so today we're not going to be having polls"
607,2019-03-23 15:32:59,Twokinds,I have a random number generator here
644,2019-03-23 15:35:08,Twokinds,It literally says
696,2019-03-23 15:37:58,Twokinds,It's not a raffle or gambling. I'm just picking which ones I want to draw.
714,2019-03-23 15:39:06,Twokinds,Oh shut up
733,2019-03-23 15:40:16,Twokinds,That was a joke you moron
1293,2019-03-23 16:38:40,Twokinds,Done I guess
1324,2019-03-23 16:40:48,Twokinds,It's supposed to be a nightmarish perseption of Rose
1326,2019-03-23 16:40:58,Twokinds,The blood is part of the nightmare
1366,2019-03-23 16:43:19,Twokinds,brb
1448,2019-03-23 16:49:13,Twokinds,I don't know what baywatch is
1450,2019-03-23 16:49:19,Twokinds,So I can't do this suggestion
1570,2019-03-23 16:59:24,Twokinds,?
1587,2019-03-23 17:00:13,Twokinds,Oh right
1592,2019-03-23 17:00:32,Twokinds,Like that
1634,2019-03-23 17:04:58,Twokinds,I assume it's some sort of floaty thingy
1708,2019-03-23 17:18:05,Twokinds,Maren's not a very popular character. I think mostly because she hasn't had a lot of character development until recently.
1709,2019-03-23 17:18:12,Twokinds,And also she doesn't have fur. XD
1796,2019-03-23 17:29:28,Twokinds,Like who
1838,2019-03-23 17:34:21,Twokinds,lol
1845,2019-03-23 17:34:45,Twokinds,Yeah Maren and Red share sort of the general sentiment of the average human
1848,2019-03-23 17:35:01,Twokinds,But Maren probably wouldn't call someone like Kat a fleabag to her face.
1856,2019-03-23 17:35:31,Twokinds,Maren calls Sythe fleabag to his face because she's more comfortable doing so.
1860,2019-03-23 17:35:59,Twokinds,Red is the type to call any Keidran a fleabag to their face and not see anything wrong with it
1890,2019-03-23 17:39:26,Twokinds,Red doesn't think of himself as racist.
1898,2019-03-23 17:39:54,Twokinds,"I mean he certainly is, but he's the type that doesn't even think about things. He just accepts that things are the way they are and why change things if it works fine."
1922,2019-03-23 17:42:50,Twokinds,The Red Haired Guy is certainly in for some culture shock now that he's in a house full of them.
1925,2019-03-23 17:42:59,Twokinds,He hasn't realized the extent of it yet.
1949,2019-03-23 17:45:07,Twokinds,Oooh yeah Red and Natani would not get along
1968,2019-03-23 17:46:51,Twokinds,Done
1987,2019-03-23 17:47:43,Twokinds,lol
2083,2019-03-23 17:55:57,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-nibsbounce::ctwokinds-nibsdance::ctwokinds-nibsbounce::ctwokinds-nibsdance::ctwokinds-nibsbounce::ctwokinds-nibsdance::ctwokinds-nibsbounce::ctwokinds-nibsdance::ctwokinds-nibsbounce:
2197,2019-03-23 18:10:03,Twokinds,Done
2225,2019-03-23 18:12:38,Twokinds,Aw
2227,2019-03-23 18:12:44,Twokinds,The music displayer was broken
2289,2019-03-23 18:21:16,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA::ctwokinds-NataniHAHA::ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
2496,2019-03-23 18:50:08,Twokinds,Doooooooooone
2553,2019-03-23 18:54:42,Twokinds,No
2554,2019-03-23 18:54:46,Twokinds,I'm just picking them
2559,2019-03-23 18:55:08,Twokinds,Would you give me one second to change it
2564,2019-03-23 18:55:29,Twokinds,This is the last one
2570,2019-03-23 18:55:56,Twokinds,I'm clearing changing it
2606,2019-03-23 18:58:26,Twokinds,They didn't specify
2614,2019-03-23 18:59:19,Twokinds,No
2882,2019-03-23 19:33:33,Twokinds,Done
3048,2019-03-23 19:49:51,Twokinds,That's because she's the first human character to get a ref sheet
3117,2019-03-23 19:55:49,Twokinds,I'm not going to be able to finish this tonight. My lines are just getting too sloppy.
3119,2019-03-23 19:55:58,Twokinds,But you get the general idea. Raine ref sheet
3122,2019-03-23 19:56:06,Twokinds,So that's going to be it from me
3157,2019-03-23 19:58:02,Twokinds,She's made because someone spilled ketchup everywhere
3158,2019-03-23 19:58:05,Twokinds,mad*
3257,2019-03-23 20:05:59,Twokinds,It was a bonus because originally at the beginning of the month I was planning to take a break
3258,2019-03-23 20:06:03,Twokinds,But then decided not to.
3259,2019-03-23 20:06:13,Twokinds,So that's the only reason.
3307,2019-03-23 20:19:46,Twokinds,Raine is going to be a big focus soon
3313,2019-03-23 20:20:12,Twokinds,I just finished writing the whole section with Rose and Raine training
3319,2019-03-23 20:20:44,Twokinds,"Yes, exactly like that."
7,2019-03-24 10:59:00,Twokinds,Good morning everyone
16,2019-03-24 11:11:26,Twokinds,Yes I've shown that one the stream a few times
20,2019-03-24 11:15:39,Twokinds,One of my failed projects D :
22,2019-03-24 11:16:03,Twokinds,I did like the character. I wish I could have done something with her. Maybe some day I will.
24,2019-03-24 11:52:43,Twokinds,I slept so badly last night and now I'm just exhausted and I haven't even done anything today.
71,2019-03-24 17:26:32,Twokinds,"Oh man, I had my pc case open on my bed being worked on, and I turned around and see my cat eyeing it like she wants to jump in."
0,2019-03-25 03:07:54,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-katdryer:
4,2019-03-25 03:20:13,Twokinds,It took me all day but my build is complete
6,2019-03-25 03:23:05,Twokinds,Yeah.
8,2019-03-25 03:26:21,Twokinds,Most of it was installing software and settings and backing up files.
9,2019-03-25 03:26:33,Twokinds,"But yes, I was more careful with cables this time."
10,2019-03-25 03:26:47,Twokinds,"In my old computer... well, I did not know the meaning of the word cable management."
12,2019-03-25 03:35:30,Twokinds,Yeah. I'll probably be working on getting all the settings back to the way I like it for a days still.
26,2019-03-25 13:36:38,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-nibsdance:
32,2019-03-25 14:22:16,Twokinds,"Yeah, I've watched a few episodes. Unfortunately, I haven't seen all of it."
33,2019-03-25 14:22:25,Twokinds,So I can't say I'm a watcher of the show.
44,2019-03-25 18:06:58,Twokinds,Wanna see my new build? :D
48,2019-03-25 18:13:47,Twokinds,One second I'll get it

52,2019-03-25 18:17:11,Twokinds,"Nora is now actually white, like she's supposed to be."
56,2019-03-25 18:17:33,Twokinds,The rgb is magic
58,2019-03-25 18:18:07,Twokinds,2700x
67,2019-03-25 18:19:11,Twokinds,"Yeah, but I don't see myself needing to upgrade any time soon."
70,2019-03-25 18:19:37,Twokinds,Thanks! I am just grateful it booted on the first try.
73,2019-03-25 18:20:27,Twokinds,"Uh... yeah, I think that's the one."
76,2019-03-25 18:20:58,Twokinds,They're both Fractal Design. The new one is the Focus G
78,2019-03-25 18:21:24,Twokinds,I got it because it was only $50 XD
82,2019-03-25 18:22:03,Twokinds,lol it's a $2000 pc
83,2019-03-25 18:22:10,Twokinds,I didn't want to spend any more!
91,2019-03-25 18:24:54,Twokinds,Thanks XD It's my first time really trying with cable management.
106,2019-03-25 18:28:32,Twokinds,That's actually what's in here.
107,2019-03-25 18:28:35,Twokinds,There's only m.3
108,2019-03-25 18:28:40,Twokinds,m.2*

122,2019-03-25 18:30:14,Twokinds,Cost a pretty penny but I wanted the fastest drive I could afford.

15,2019-03-26 02:24:08,Twokinds,I need to find something
18,2019-03-26 03:35:06,Twokinds,Thanks!
20,2019-03-26 03:38:08,Twokinds,Someone asked me what my most complicated sktech suggestion was.
21,2019-03-26 03:38:45,Twokinds,I needed an easy way to search.
22,2019-03-26 03:38:53,Twokinds,Now to bed
39,2019-03-26 14:16:26,Twokinds,"Re: Baywatch, my bad, new computer."

175,2019-03-28 20:07:01,Twokinds,My music display doesn't seem to be working right now
183,2019-03-28 20:07:47,Twokinds,"Shoot, I also forgot to actually get my music"
185,2019-03-28 20:07:49,Twokinds,Onto this new pc
221,2019-03-28 20:10:01,Twokinds,Just had to download it
226,2019-03-28 20:10:31,Twokinds,displayer still down
247,2019-03-28 20:12:44,Twokinds,Oh yeah
248,2019-03-28 20:12:51,Twokinds,Her wolf form adds two inches
250,2019-03-28 20:13:00,Twokinds,That's a typo XD
262,2019-03-28 20:14:08,Twokinds,Eh
267,2019-03-28 20:14:24,Twokinds,Yeah all that fur is heavy
270,2019-03-28 20:14:31,Twokinds,She's extremely fluffy
273,2019-03-28 20:14:36,Twokinds,Even compared to other wolves
277,2019-03-28 20:14:58,Twokinds,I've been hard at work all week transfering settings over to this new PC
280,2019-03-28 20:15:06,Twokinds,So I'm not sure how well this stream will go XD
285,2019-03-28 20:15:31,Twokinds,Oh?
288,2019-03-28 20:15:51,Twokinds,Yes
302,2019-03-28 20:16:31,Twokinds,So far so good
305,2019-03-28 20:16:46,Twokinds,"I had one crash yesterday, but I think that might have been because I needed several windows updates."
308,2019-03-28 20:17:06,Twokinds,Here is the Nora 1 btw
338,2019-03-28 20:20:40,Twokinds,I do need to do a bois update to the most recent version.
347,2019-03-28 20:21:14,Twokinds,"Eh, everything in the bois is currently at default, except RAM which I had to set manually."
352,2019-03-28 20:22:01,Twokinds,"I'm not going to be overclocking anything, especially with the default cooler."
358,2019-03-28 20:22:50,Twokinds,Seems good
365,2019-03-28 20:23:16,Twokinds,Well most intel don't come with coolers these days anywy
373,2019-03-28 20:24:00,Twokinds,Woah XD
374,2019-03-28 20:24:12,Twokinds,Those builds are crazy
412,2019-03-28 20:26:42,Twokinds,Before their colors were established
424,2019-03-28 20:27:03,Twokinds,"Karen, Keith, Trace, Flora, and Sythe."
445,2019-03-28 20:28:06,Twokinds,"I don't think I ever used this banner, because I changed all the colors once Twokinds started. XD"
447,2019-03-28 20:28:13,Twokinds,This is pre-Twokinds test coloring.
452,2019-03-28 20:28:39,Twokinds,Just a staff.
459,2019-03-28 20:29:16,Twokinds,EARLY map
467,2019-03-28 20:29:52,Twokinds,Yeah
469,2019-03-28 20:30:04,Twokinds,Here's something to show that anyone can be an artist
482,2019-03-28 20:30:27,Twokinds,My art about 3 years before Twokinds.
503,2019-03-28 20:31:49,Twokinds,I found this old scan and really wanna finish that top left sketch
521,2019-03-28 20:33:09,Twokinds,More old art
524,2019-03-28 20:33:24,Twokinds,XD I was just going through ALL my records while transfering docs onto new PC
531,2019-03-28 20:33:41,Twokinds,9
546,2019-03-28 20:34:05,Twokinds,Early mask
562,2019-03-28 20:34:46,Twokinds,I was not good
568,2019-03-28 20:35:06,Twokinds,"And interestingly, the date this happened to be on."
628,2019-03-28 20:37:23,Twokinds,Yeah like 99% of my old stuff is still just in a folder somewhere
691,2019-03-28 20:41:48,Twokinds,I had to animate it by hand.
692,2019-03-28 20:41:55,Twokinds,"Obviously, copied from youtube's"
803,2019-03-28 20:52:11,Twokinds,Red's hair annoys me lol
808,2019-03-28 20:52:43,Twokinds,I've considered having him get a haircut and becoming more like Scarlet's
812,2019-03-28 20:53:38,Twokinds,Eh okay
814,2019-03-28 20:53:42,Twokinds,I'll keep it then XD
1098,2019-03-28 21:52:35,Twokinds,The computer didn't crash
1099,2019-03-28 21:52:42,Twokinds,So I don't know what you're talking about.
1101,2019-03-28 21:52:57,Twokinds,I just restarted to see if it fixed Photoshop.
1138,2019-03-28 21:56:20,Twokinds,Man it did it again
1139,2019-03-28 21:56:25,Twokinds,Something's really wrong
1143,2019-03-28 21:56:35,Twokinds,It freezes
1150,2019-03-28 21:57:14,Twokinds,Everything else works fine
1152,2019-03-28 21:57:45,Twokinds,Whenever I use a large brush
1168,2019-03-28 21:59:41,Twokinds,Running tests
1232,2019-03-28 22:10:49,Twokinds,?
1234,2019-03-28 22:10:54,Twokinds,No it's still fine
1244,2019-03-28 22:12:08,Twokinds,I changed some photoshop settings
1246,2019-03-28 22:12:22,Twokinds,"So far it hasn't crashed again, we'll see"
1258,2019-03-28 22:16:59,Twokinds,Galexica
1259,2019-03-28 22:17:04,Twokinds,Panda Eye

1641,2019-03-28 23:39:22,Twokinds,Done
1652,2019-03-28 23:40:10,Twokinds,How should I know
1661,2019-03-28 23:42:36,Twokinds,Why does it need updating
1690,2019-03-28 23:51:00,Twokinds,Thanks! I inspire me too
1726,2019-03-28 23:56:31,Twokinds,I've seen you

23,2019-03-30 14:02:14,Twokinds,That was in the artbook
30,2019-03-30 14:18:58,Twokinds,Yeah the artbook is one of the few things I keep as purely physical
34,2019-03-30 14:20:52,Twokinds,I'm hoping to do Artbook v2
35,2019-03-30 14:21:14,Twokinds,But drawing enough new art for 120 pages takes a long time
42,2019-03-30 14:28:42,Twokinds,The color poll was interesting
43,2019-03-30 14:29:12,Twokinds,"All were very close, nothing was a huge runaway winner"
47,2019-03-30 14:30:47,Twokinds,pool
56,2019-03-30 14:31:57,Twokinds,"Yeah not a regular sunday sketch... though it was posted on a sunday, so technically... lol"

328,2019-03-30 15:12:47,Twokinds,"And now, for the top 3"
415,2019-03-30 15:15:59,Twokinds,"And finally, for the number 1 spot"
416,2019-03-30 15:16:01,Twokinds,Place your bets
441,2019-03-30 15:17:07,Twokinds,Loootta Natani this month
452,2019-03-30 15:17:23,Twokinds,"Surprisingly, not a landslide"
460,2019-03-30 15:17:37,Twokinds,All the votes were very close.
464,2019-03-30 15:17:47,Twokinds,The runners up were within 2 - 4 votes too
468,2019-03-30 15:17:55,Twokinds,Every sketch got a lot of votes
479,2019-03-30 15:18:33,Twokinds,Yeah I was a bit surprised too.
612,2019-03-30 15:37:47,Twokinds,you guys were very kind to me this month
692,2019-03-30 15:50:25,Twokinds,Done

895,2019-03-30 16:27:56,Twokinds,"Okay, typing all this up will take a while, so I'm calling it done here ^^"
901,2019-03-30 16:28:22,Twokinds,It is a color stream not a writing stream after all lol
1005,2019-03-30 16:46:08,Twokinds,Yeah maybe
1008,2019-03-30 16:46:21,Twokinds,I know some people naturally tiptoe when not wearing shoes just all the time.
1036,2019-03-30 16:53:10,Twokinds,yeah it's just part of the character design
1037,2019-03-30 16:53:28,Twokinds,Like why some foxes have muzzles and some don't. It's just to make them look different.
1044,2019-03-30 16:59:08,Twokinds,Done
1050,2019-03-30 16:59:22,Twokinds,brb

1222,2019-03-30 18:01:09,Twokinds,That was odd
1224,2019-03-30 18:01:14,Twokinds,The music just ended for some reason
1230,2019-03-30 18:01:44,Twokinds,"It shouldn't - the Twokinds playlist is randomized, and over 14 hours long"
1242,2019-03-30 18:05:13,Twokinds,I'm always on the lookout for more bouncy music
1340,2019-03-30 18:19:37,Twokinds,Done
1354,2019-03-30 18:20:12,Twokinds,Wanted to make it more general magic
1422,2019-03-30 18:26:22,Twokinds,This is pretty out of character for Keith XD
1485,2019-03-30 18:34:31,Twokinds,"Not true - Keith also has ""walked in on someone"" face"
1499,2019-03-30 18:35:24,Twokinds,Usually Natani
1501,2019-03-30 18:35:26,Twokinds,Yeah
1843,2019-03-30 19:14:47,Twokinds,Oops All Floras
1859,2019-03-30 19:15:59,Twokinds,The side story where somehow errant magic turns everyone in the estate except Trace into Flora.
1908,2019-03-30 19:20:20,Twokinds,I'm done for now
2092,2019-03-30 19:35:39,Twokinds,Done

29,2019-04-02 13:17:55,Twokinds,No it's just a visual bug on Patreon's end as far as I can tel
30,2019-04-02 13:18:06,Twokinds,Though changing passwords is a good idea every now and then regardless.
31,2019-04-02 13:18:18,Twokinds,Seemed to be affecting mobile.
36,2019-04-02 13:32:34,Twokinds,That's interesting
42,2019-04-02 14:05:16,Twokinds,Man I'm having a lot of typos lately

13,2019-04-03 10:21:33,Twokinds,"Yeah, I suppose that's true."
14,2019-04-03 10:22:00,Twokinds,Getting good at something does require having the drive to put in the effort.
15,2019-04-03 10:40:44,Twokinds,That applies to anything. I can't learn a foreign language because I lack the drive to dedicate myself to it.
24,2019-04-03 10:57:01,Twokinds,I don't know
25,2019-04-03 10:57:15,Twokinds,It would depend on the context. I don't know what animal terms means.
26,2019-04-03 10:57:20,Twokinds,Maybe animal?
27,2019-04-03 10:57:29,Twokinds,No clue.
28,2019-04-03 10:57:51,Twokinds,I took 1 semester of Japanese in college and retained NONE of it. :\
37,2019-04-03 12:02:47,Twokinds,I do like the emphasize that they aren't human.

862,2019-04-04 22:23:32,Twokinds,Why not just tell your body to stop it
874,2019-04-04 22:24:54,Twokinds,Darn
876,2019-04-04 22:25:03,Twokinds,It works for me!
1047,2019-04-04 23:05:25,Twokinds,Dawn of the last day 24 hours remaining
1062,2019-04-04 23:09:06,Twokinds,That sucks
1066,2019-04-04 23:10:12,Twokinds,DONE

198,2019-04-05 01:35:54,Twokinds,Yeah my 970 lasted me a looong time
200,2019-04-05 01:35:59,Twokinds,Very faithfully.

225,2019-04-06 14:59:31,Twokinds,Getting things organized
335,2019-04-06 15:10:24,Twokinds,I've decided to start trying to excerise between sketches during votes for my health XD ^^
338,2019-04-06 15:10:35,Twokinds,It's good to get up and stretch
340,2019-04-06 15:10:39,Twokinds,Sitting for hours is unhealthy
522,2019-04-06 15:22:33,Twokinds,I hope it does!

1392,2019-04-06 16:17:33,Twokinds,Yeah I know I'll fix it later

1723,2019-04-06 16:38:40,Twokinds,Nora and other dragons see lizardfolk like dogs
1775,2019-04-06 16:42:46,Twokinds,Depends? They're less intellegent than Keidran.
1791,2019-04-06 16:44:05,Twokinds,"They're not quite animals, but less than human."
1794,2019-04-06 16:44:09,Twokinds,They're about inbetween.
1802,2019-04-06 16:44:46,Twokinds,"No, Keidran and humans are generally on the same level."
1804,2019-04-06 16:44:58,Twokinds,"Or I should say, they're both capable of the same range of intellegence."
1809,2019-04-06 16:45:12,Twokinds,But it'd be a very rare lizardfolk who ever came close to the average keidran or human.

2045,2019-04-06 17:02:55,Twokinds,"Since dragons are pretty rare, probably."
2083,2019-04-06 17:05:24,Twokinds,Have I drawn Flora human?
2095,2019-04-06 17:05:49,Twokinds,I don't think I have.
2113,2019-04-06 17:06:43,Twokinds,Thanks for the links ^^
2114,2019-04-06 17:06:50,Twokinds,I just wanted someone to get them for me
2360,2019-04-06 17:33:37,Twokinds,"Pro-tip: if you're having trouble drawing, just write the name of the thing it's supposed to be."

2446,2019-04-06 17:41:39,Twokinds,Well Twokinds isn't referring to the number of species
2449,2019-04-06 17:41:50,Twokinds,It's about relationships that form between two different kinds of people.
2459,2019-04-06 17:42:30,Twokinds,It's also about people who have two sides to themselves.
2512,2019-04-06 17:45:43,Twokinds,Yeah unfortunately Patreon Sunday streams are non-multi
2513,2019-04-06 17:45:51,Twokinds,Sorry!
2518,2019-04-06 17:46:31,Twokinds,"Yeah Patreon special stream, every sunday"

2922,2019-04-06 18:34:22,Twokinds,She's fine.
2931,2019-04-06 18:34:52,Twokinds,She's always just asking for trouble getting underfoot.
2936,2019-04-06 18:35:07,Twokinds,She's the bravest dog my mother has
2937,2019-04-06 18:35:20,Twokinds,Which is funny because she's also tiny

4039,2019-04-06 20:44:52,Twokinds,Because it hinged on me ACTUALLY being able to draw an attractive guy.

52,2019-04-07 19:14:58,Twokinds,That's so much better. Now I can finally include all characters when there's a big group.

744,2019-04-11 21:48:12,Twokinds,It's pretty much a mutant entity unto its own
753,2019-04-11 21:49:35,Twokinds,I really enjoyed Togue Legacy. I think that's one of my favorites.

758,2019-04-11 21:50:02,Twokinds,I liked the sense of progression.
760,2019-04-11 21:50:09,Twokinds,I beat it.
766,2019-04-11 21:50:55,Twokinds,FTL
768,2019-04-11 21:51:01,Twokinds,Probably one of the best.
774,2019-04-11 21:51:35,Twokinds,I'm not sure if I liked Into the Breach
776,2019-04-11 21:52:21,Twokinds,"I played through one game, beat it, and then didn't really feel like going through again. Which is weird, I like puzzle-y games, but it felt too easy."

811,2019-04-11 21:56:04,Twokinds,I both loved and hated the final challanges.
814,2019-04-11 21:56:24,Twokinds,Darkwood... haven't played that one.
818,2019-04-11 21:57:50,Twokinds,Yeah I've heard of it. I do want to give it a try.
820,2019-04-11 21:58:19,Twokinds,Even though I'm not really into dark or grimey themes in games. Not really my bag.

1029,2019-04-11 22:52:58,Twokinds,I dreamt it was a phone app.
1030,2019-04-11 22:53:14,Twokinds,And it was just a really mundane thing and a bit of a hastle.
1062,2019-04-11 22:58:11,Twokinds,"In one of the upcoming comics I'm working on there's teleport circles that are set up like automated ticket booths outside train stations. Dial in destination, swipe credit card, arrive outside apartment."

1076,2019-04-11 22:59:14,Twokinds,Yeah Sam and Colin
1081,2019-04-11 22:59:31,Twokinds,And the Trains are because of that credit card part. Long distance is expensive.
1084,2019-04-11 22:59:44,Twokinds,"So it's ""local calls only"""
1095,2019-04-11 23:04:55,Twokinds,"Like I said, expensive to do."
1098,2019-04-11 23:05:25,Twokinds,"Much cheaper to take the train, especially for moving large amounts between cities, or for someone going back and forth frequently."
1101,2019-04-11 23:07:33,Twokinds,I imagine cities themselves would be layed out completely differently.
1108,2019-04-11 23:08:25,Twokinds,"Probably very sprawling, with no public inner city traffic. Just goods and bulk freight delivery."
1123,2019-04-11 23:10:51,Twokinds,Probably
1126,2019-04-11 23:11:27,Twokinds,That's what this building here is. The teleportation nexus.
1132,2019-04-11 23:12:30,Twokinds,The one next to it is the teleportation nexus. The one split in half.
1133,2019-04-11 23:12:57,Twokinds,It takes people from one place and drops them off at another.
1142,2019-04-11 23:13:41,Twokinds,"It can handle a lot of traffic, but it has once gotten backed up. Boy were people miffed to be hours late when they appeared."

1303,2019-04-11 23:59:41,Twokinds,I went with the hair changing across panels because otherwise it's just two characters talking statically.
1305,2019-04-11 23:59:48,Twokinds,I needed something to add to the flow.

58,2019-04-12 00:33:09,Twokinds,Wonder what Raine would look like if her hair was cut short
64,2019-04-12 00:35:07,Twokinds,But then she'll lose her powers
90,2019-04-12 00:46:38,Twokinds,Byeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
99,2019-04-12 01:15:24,Twokinds,lol that's well done
100,2019-04-12 01:15:27,Twokinds,It's certainly interesting
133,2019-04-12 01:32:47,Twokinds,Done
140,2019-04-12 01:34:42,Twokinds,"I'm happy with the way this one turned out, personally."
143,2019-04-12 01:35:22,Twokinds,"And now, I shall make my great escape!"
144,2019-04-12 01:35:28,Twokinds,So long!
202,2019-04-12 03:13:36,Twokinds,augh
205,2019-04-12 03:14:37,Twokinds,It's hard to decide what text I should cut out.
208,2019-04-12 03:16:34,Twokinds,Yeah I've had to cut a few lines
214,2019-04-12 03:22:45,Twokinds,Yeah but this stuff is necessary
237,2019-04-12 15:14:06,Twokinds,I have Alexa turn my lights on automatically so I don't have to walk across the room and flip a switch.
239,2019-04-12 15:14:59,Twokinds,"Oh, smart bulbs are so needlessly expensive"
240,2019-04-12 15:15:10,Twokinds,I use smart plugs
242,2019-04-12 15:15:28,Twokinds,More versitile and don't need to throw them away when the bulb dies
243,2019-04-12 15:15:52,Twokinds,"Yeah, just have the lamp plugged into the wifi plug."
245,2019-04-12 15:17:18,Twokinds,Yeah I don't use my ceiling light as a result.
247,2019-04-12 15:18:30,Twokinds,"But because the smart plug is attached to a power strip, I can have multiple things plugged in at once and set to a routine. My dream is to get electronic blinds and then have them open up in the morning, so I can pretend I'm Adam Jensen."
267,2019-04-12 15:54:14,Twokinds,"Mmm, decontructed hamburger"
269,2019-04-12 16:00:16,Twokinds,lol yeah I guess

46,2019-04-13 14:02:53,Twokinds,"Oh, okay"
48,2019-04-13 14:02:59,Twokinds,Your extra details were culled anyway
55,2019-04-13 14:09:43,Twokinds,That's not what I mean by specific. I just mean that suggestions should describe the scene I should draw. They need to be visual.
57,2019-04-13 14:10:19,Twokinds,"""Maeve meeting Mrs Nibbly"" isn't very specific, because it's open ended. ""Maeve chasing Mrs Nibbly"" isn't any longer, but it's specfic."
65,2019-04-13 14:12:48,Twokinds,Nibs for sure
68,2019-04-13 14:13:24,Twokinds,"Your suggestion is fine, iliar."
81,2019-04-13 14:24:24,Twokinds,Patreon messages is bugged and now always says I have 1 new message despite there not being any.
82,2019-04-13 14:24:31,Twokinds,That's annoying.

149,2019-04-13 14:45:32,Twokinds,Defeated the boss with one massive god-tier spell
151,2019-04-13 14:45:38,Twokinds,Leaving a splatter on the wall.
159,2019-04-13 14:46:44,Twokinds,"The spell freezes an enemy for one round, and hitting the enemy stored up kinetic energy and was released all at once when they unfreeze."
160,2019-04-13 14:46:52,Twokinds,Boss went flying at 500mph into a wall.
169,2019-04-13 14:47:35,Twokinds,Pretty much
199,2019-04-13 14:53:21,Twokinds,lol
203,2019-04-13 14:53:50,Twokinds,"My character was focused entirely on being the best cook, and being the fasters halfling ever"
204,2019-04-13 14:53:57,Twokinds,And she succeeded!
213,2019-04-13 14:54:28,Twokinds,But she was definitely not the strongest because of that focus. XD

1067,2019-04-13 16:20:11,Twokinds,I need to try and adjust the timing
1078,2019-04-13 16:21:04,Twokinds,Sure but I can make it start sooner
1299,2019-04-13 16:46:17,Twokinds,Sad truth
1302,2019-04-13 16:46:47,Twokinds,"So many webcomics, still on hiatus"
1308,2019-04-13 16:47:39,Twokinds,btw guys Twokinds is going on a hiatus
1318,2019-04-13 16:47:56,Twokinds,Ok I'm back
1342,2019-04-13 16:50:50,Twokinds,Yeah I hate when artists take their stuff down
1347,2019-04-13 16:51:19,Twokinds,"Like, I know it's their work and their right to do so, but when you put a story or a comic or whatever out there, it becomes a part of other peole's lives. It's sad to see it disappear."
1383,2019-04-13 16:54:49,Twokinds,I don't think I've ever seen a webcomic revive after being on hiatus for over a year or two
1393,2019-04-13 16:55:51,Twokinds,"Oh yeah, all my pages is redundantly backed up"
1543,2019-04-13 17:14:54,Twokinds,meh
1545,2019-04-13 17:15:02,Twokinds,I like the idea of that pose but it covers her back
1546,2019-04-13 17:15:08,Twokinds,Which defeats the purpose
1640,2019-04-13 17:29:32,Twokinds,Hello Lann! Welcome!
1645,2019-04-13 17:29:44,Twokinds,Always good to see someone for the first time!

1788,2019-04-13 17:44:29,Twokinds,I'll fill in the rest of this later

2257,2019-04-13 18:34:05,Twokinds,That's why I like using grapes XD
2260,2019-04-13 18:34:09,Twokinds,Cause it doesn't make sense
2313,2019-04-13 18:39:35,Twokinds,It's a terrible clock with a battery backup that doesn't switch in time to prevent it from reading 12:00 during an outage.
2330,2019-04-13 18:41:14,Twokinds,Done
2350,2019-04-13 18:43:32,Twokinds,Yeah I don't get to do cityscapes very often
2352,2019-04-13 18:43:42,Twokinds,And I love rain. So I really wanted to do this one.
2359,2019-04-13 18:44:10,Twokinds,oh.
2364,2019-04-13 18:44:34,Twokinds,Someone else must have requested the same thing and I didn't notice
2374,2019-04-13 18:45:35,Twokinds,Then it's the second pick obviously
2388,2019-04-13 18:48:43,Twokinds,3 more to go
2415,2019-04-13 18:53:07,Twokinds,"You know, I've never seen Ghostbusters"
2453,2019-04-13 18:54:45,Twokinds,Oh! I haven't seen Back to the Future! I watched it for the first time I think last year.
2454,2019-04-13 18:54:50,Twokinds,"Er, HAVE"

2461,2019-04-13 18:55:22,Twokinds,It's on the list

3622,2019-04-13 20:56:00,Twokinds,"lol yeah, but for real, Natani actually has a harder time fighting unbound, because it throws off muscle memory with the shift in center of balance."
3705,2019-04-13 21:04:19,Twokinds,Done!
3741,2019-04-13 21:06:25,Twokinds,Yeah Basitin strength is slightly further along on the anime scale
3745,2019-04-13 21:06:40,Twokinds,XD Deceptively strong
3759,2019-04-13 21:07:23,Twokinds,Yeah Basitin have to have something to counterbalance the lack of magic
3768,2019-04-13 21:08:13,Twokinds,"It depends. Natani outweights Keith be a considerable amount, so it's a totally different weight class. But Basitin strength closes the gap."
3772,2019-04-13 21:08:40,Twokinds,And Keith's better skilled.
3778,2019-04-13 21:09:01,Twokinds,If they arm wrestled? Hmm... I don't want to say who would win.
3783,2019-04-13 21:09:16,Twokinds,Keep speculating XD

3872,2019-04-13 21:14:08,Twokinds,Just showing what the underside of her tail looks like.

4121,2019-04-13 23:14:54,Twokinds,And it's even more unhappy about giving up the rest of carbs too.
4123,2019-04-13 23:15:24,Twokinds,And fat!
4124,2019-04-13 23:15:39,Twokinds,fats and protein.
4127,2019-04-13 23:16:42,Twokinds,yeah I needed to go lighter on sugar a long time ago.
4129,2019-04-13 23:16:49,Twokinds,My diet was very unhealthy for a while.

115,2019-04-15 19:47:24,Twokinds,I'm trrying to find a way to describe Flora on her character sheet as being a little dumb without being mean about it XD

158,2019-04-15 19:59:34,Twokinds,No?
160,2019-04-15 20:00:36,Twokinds,"How about ""head in the clouds""?"
166,2019-04-15 20:02:52,Twokinds,I've never heard that
167,2019-04-15 20:03:03,Twokinds,I misread it as ingenius at ifrst
171,2019-04-15 20:03:57,Twokinds,How about earnest.
172,2019-04-15 20:04:07,Twokinds,"And yeah, of course, disingenuous"
173,2019-04-15 20:04:14,Twokinds,But I don't think anyone would really use ingenuous
178,2019-04-15 20:05:08,Twokinds,Well I'm thinking of any way to describe Flora's mental characterstics or personality.
190,2019-04-15 20:07:51,Twokinds,she pounces
197,2019-04-15 20:08:54,Twokinds,"Eh, she isn't really ""bubbly"""
198,2019-04-15 20:09:12,Twokinds,And her emotional moments are due to pregnancy mostly
200,2019-04-15 20:09:15,Twokinds,She is romantic
201,2019-04-15 20:09:25,Twokinds,She has a wanderlust

207,2019-04-15 20:10:52,Twokinds,Natural and honest I feel counts under Earnest
209,2019-04-15 20:11:23,Twokinds,She is bi-lingual
210,2019-04-15 20:11:29,Twokinds,She is semi-illiterate
215,2019-04-15 20:12:25,Twokinds,haha
218,2019-04-15 20:12:50,Twokinds,She is... a disney princess who 'wants more'
228,2019-04-15 20:15:51,Twokinds,Is adventurous personality or mental trait?
232,2019-04-15 20:16:31,Twokinds,"Personality is how they act, mental is how they think"
236,2019-04-15 20:17:48,Twokinds,lol personality it is
241,2019-04-15 20:18:53,Twokinds,Twokinds AU where Flora is Gryffindor and Trace is Slytherin.
278,2019-04-15 20:29:06,Twokinds,I wonder if I should include the lore about tiger tribes onto her page
279,2019-04-15 20:29:34,Twokinds,"I mean, it's not strictly necessary, but it does describe where she came from before being captured."
283,2019-04-15 20:30:14,Twokinds,Yeah maybe not
284,2019-04-15 20:30:25,Twokinds,I don't think I'll included it.
294,2019-04-15 20:32:19,Twokinds,I don't know how to translate Tiger society into english
297,2019-04-15 20:33:25,Twokinds,lol
299,2019-04-15 20:33:41,Twokinds,There's no words for the kind of ranks the tigers arranged themselves in.
307,2019-04-15 20:34:59,Twokinds,I don't know
317,2019-04-15 20:44:45,Twokinds,Flora's backstory is pretty long
319,2019-04-15 20:47:25,Twokinds,lol
322,2019-04-15 20:48:34,Twokinds,"Flora was captured by slavers, who were taking her to the capital to be sold as a slave to nobility, tigers being considered exotic."
323,2019-04-15 20:49:36,Twokinds,"But she escaped from the cart cages during the journey (when the caravan was attacked), and ended up falling into a river while on the run and washing up on a farm in Edinmire."
324,2019-04-15 20:49:46,Twokinds,Where she was found by a white wolf named Euchre.
328,2019-04-15 20:54:06,Twokinds,"Euchre took her to the humans of the farm, who took her in. When the slaving company came looking for the escaped tiger, the farm family covered her up."
333,2019-04-15 20:56:54,Twokinds,"They grew to treat her as somewhat of a daughter, but the relationship grew increasingly strained as she got older and the realities of the class different became more present."
334,2019-04-15 20:57:39,Twokinds,Flora eventually decided she had to leave the life behind and ran.
336,2019-04-15 20:59:37,Twokinds,Yes.
340,2019-04-15 21:00:19,Twokinds,"He worked as a voluntary indentured servant, which is something Keidran can do legally, though obviously it's rarely a good arrangement."
342,2019-04-15 21:00:40,Twokinds,But in his case he was careful to pick the family well and of course forged his documents.
347,2019-04-15 21:02:33,Twokinds,"It's complicated. Some keidran are freer than others in human society, but it's always a tenuous relationship."
348,2019-04-15 21:02:45,Twokinds,Keidran have to always be careful to 'know their place' among humans.
350,2019-04-15 21:04:55,Twokinds,"Yeah. A lot of humans during this time don't like to be told what to do by Keidran, even if the Keidran is technically in the right to do so."
354,2019-04-15 21:07:20,Twokinds,Indeed
356,2019-04-15 21:08:29,Twokinds,There are quite a few humans in the empire who are actually keidran in disguise.
357,2019-04-15 21:08:44,Twokinds,"Euchre, of course, being one of them."
358,2019-04-15 21:09:00,Twokinds,Same goes for the other way around.
360,2019-04-15 21:09:08,Twokinds,Though less common.
362,2019-04-15 21:09:44,Twokinds,"Usually when it's the other way around, it's for espionage."
377,2019-04-15 21:28:27,Twokinds,Anything else I should add to Flora's character sheet?
379,2019-04-15 21:29:01,Twokinds,No no more descriptions anything else?

2383,2019-04-20 18:54:31,Twokinds,She lifted one side of a stone tower with all her might causing it to fall and collapse.
2412,2019-04-20 18:56:41,Twokinds,lol
2435,2019-04-20 18:58:30,Twokinds,"Adelaide has ridiculous strength, but I don't want it to be TOO ridiculous. I want it to be realistic enough that it can be appreciated as impressive. After a point there's just no frame of reference."
2447,2019-04-20 18:58:56,Twokinds,"her bringing down that tower was what made her legendary in Basitin eyes, but it nearly destroyed her body in the process."
2677,2019-04-20 19:31:41,Twokinds,NO
2686,2019-04-20 19:32:07,Twokinds,Not every pair of panties is THE panties. jeez.
2832,2019-04-20 19:49:37,Twokinds,Done
3142,2019-04-20 20:22:25,Twokinds,Done
3166,2019-04-20 20:23:21,Twokinds,I used body intentionally
3172,2019-04-20 20:23:40,Twokinds,The masks are just masks. They literally need a body to interact with the physical world.
3177,2019-04-20 20:24:11,Twokinds,Yeah sure
3188,2019-04-20 20:24:49,Twokinds,Of course
3190,2019-04-20 20:24:53,Twokinds,Neutral was broken
3196,2019-04-20 20:25:28,Twokinds,They've vulnerable when the body they're in is compromised
3198,2019-04-20 20:25:47,Twokinds,"They can't be killed, but it takes a while to regen"
3200,2019-04-20 20:25:56,Twokinds,And they can't full possess someone when they're in pieces
3206,2019-04-20 20:26:20,Twokinds,I mean this was a previous suggestion
3208,2019-04-20 20:26:27,Twokinds,This is what Neutral's face is now
3237,2019-04-20 20:27:30,Twokinds,Iknow right?
3238,2019-04-20 20:27:32,Twokinds,Time man
3241,2019-04-20 20:27:38,Twokinds,It don't let up
3250,2019-04-20 20:27:53,Twokinds,I try to just not worry about time
3252,2019-04-20 20:27:59,Twokinds,Things happen as they happen
3255,2019-04-20 20:28:06,Twokinds,It'll get done no matter how long it takes.
3264,2019-04-20 20:28:41,Twokinds,"They would be powerless that that point, so essentially dead."
3267,2019-04-20 20:28:47,Twokinds,They wouldn't be able to mess with mortals anymore.
3269,2019-04-20 20:29:04,Twokinds,That's the end goal of each mask
3271,2019-04-20 20:29:13,Twokinds,The the only 'god'
3275,2019-04-20 20:29:20,Twokinds,Be the only god
3292,2019-04-20 20:30:18,Twokinds,That would be Order
3301,2019-04-20 20:30:53,Twokinds,He wants peace... at all costs. He'd be happy if everyone was dead. Ultimate peace.
3325,2019-04-20 20:31:46,Twokinds,Chaos wants things to be interesting.
3331,2019-04-20 20:32:06,Twokinds,"He likes races mixing together, as Trace and co are doing."
3337,2019-04-20 20:32:25,Twokinds,"He also likes wars and slavery. But not too much, cause if one side wins it's boring."
3357,2019-04-20 20:33:07,Twokinds,They're all kinda good and evil in different ways
3363,2019-04-20 20:33:32,Twokinds,Neutral is neurotic. They want everything in their proper place and NEVER CHANGING.
3367,2019-04-20 20:33:41,Twokinds,They would be happy if time didn't move at all.
3380,2019-04-20 20:34:24,Twokinds,lol
3382,2019-04-20 20:34:27,Twokinds,Yes
3387,2019-04-20 20:34:41,Twokinds,Neutral hates it when people mess with its toys.
3397,2019-04-20 20:35:13,Twokinds,"Order keeps putting everything in rows where they're not supposed to be, and chaos keeps mixing everything up."
3400,2019-04-20 20:35:24,Twokinds,There's an order and only ORDER can fix it.
3404,2019-04-20 20:35:40,Twokinds,"There's an order and only Neutral can fix it,"
3409,2019-04-20 20:35:51,Twokinds,Typo
3415,2019-04-20 20:36:11,Twokinds,"Yeah, there was a fourth mask"
3417,2019-04-20 20:36:15,Twokinds,But it doesn't exist anymore
3446,2019-04-20 20:37:51,Twokinds,"If a mask is truly destroyed, their concept ceases to exist."
3460,2019-04-20 20:38:35,Twokinds,"If Neutral was fully destroyed, there'd be no middle ground at all. It's be all chaos and all order and no inbetween all the time."
3467,2019-04-20 20:39:06,Twokinds,Chaos OR order
3480,2019-04-20 20:39:41,Twokinds,I mean it's hard to imagine. Just as the people of Twokinds can't imagine the concept the 4th mask would represent.
3483,2019-04-20 20:39:46,Twokinds,Like imagining a new color.
3497,2019-04-20 20:40:49,Twokinds,Clearly it's Nibbs
3498,2019-04-20 20:40:54,Twokinds,The fourth mask all along
3538,2019-04-20 20:44:30,Twokinds,Next week
3540,2019-04-20 20:44:37,Twokinds,"And no, Kat's never had a control collar on"
3544,2019-04-20 20:45:13,Twokinds,Control collars are a pretty recent invention and weren't really in common use until after Trace's instatement.
3551,2019-04-20 20:45:48,Twokinds,"Rich people had them. Kat's owners might have had them, but for domestic servants, it's a matter of pride that Keidran are 'broken' properly."
3557,2019-04-20 20:46:23,Twokinds,Using a collar kinda goes against it when it just subverts their will.
3561,2019-04-20 20:46:35,Twokinds,"If the collar stops working, suddenly you have unruly Keidran."
3571,2019-04-20 20:46:57,Twokinds,Ah I don't know how
3654,2019-04-20 20:52:32,Twokinds,what one pose
3676,2019-04-20 20:54:12,Twokinds,This was sunday sketch #005!
3678,2019-04-20 20:54:19,Twokinds,From the very first sunday sketch week

3945,2019-04-20 21:26:58,Twokinds,"Her sisters waylayed him and lied, saying she didn't want to see him."

4136,2019-04-20 21:46:25,Twokinds,I couldn't fit the third one
4138,2019-04-20 21:46:33,Twokinds,"But uh, she looks kinda like Laura"
4150,2019-04-20 21:47:01,Twokinds,Sure
4157,2019-04-20 21:47:36,Twokinds,"Honestly, she was just supposed to have a cloak on but I got lazy"
4159,2019-04-20 21:47:45,Twokinds,Might nakkedify later maybe
4173,2019-04-20 21:48:24,Twokinds,ok
4176,2019-04-20 21:48:37,Twokinds,She's the weird one who wears clothes
4177,2019-04-20 21:48:39,Twokinds,What a weirdo
4190,2019-04-20 21:49:06,Twokinds,lol
4210,2019-04-20 21:50:39,Twokinds,Last one
4331,2019-04-20 22:00:01,Twokinds,"No, cocaine"
4637,2019-04-20 22:21:00,Twokinds,Done
4691,2019-04-20 22:22:52,Twokinds,Okay I'm done for today
4712,2019-04-20 22:23:23,Twokinds,lol
4716,2019-04-20 22:23:27,Twokinds,Yours was in one of the first polls
4738,2019-04-20 22:24:23,Twokinds,Yep
4745,2019-04-20 22:24:38,Twokinds,Two people wanted Rose Ref so I figured I would
4747,2019-04-20 22:24:44,Twokinds,Uh...
4752,2019-04-20 22:24:50,Twokinds,This one I'll finish later.
4866,2019-04-20 22:30:42,Twokinds,Pretty much
4870,2019-04-20 22:30:50,Twokinds,All foxes are flat

5085,2019-04-20 22:43:41,Twokinds,So tired
5119,2019-04-20 22:46:48,Twokinds,Easter was hard
5122,2019-04-20 22:47:05,Twokinds,I went to an easter party and my stepmom even gave me an easter basket
5129,2019-04-20 22:47:29,Twokinds,I had one cadburry egg and I felt really bad about it. XD
5139,2019-04-20 22:47:42,Twokinds,It was all my sugar allowance for the entire day in one egg
5142,2019-04-20 22:47:50,Twokinds,20g
5154,2019-04-20 22:48:18,Twokinds,Yes I've been tired for the last week without sugar
5162,2019-04-20 22:48:54,Twokinds,Cutting back from like... 100 - 300g of sugar a day to 20g is not easy.
5181,2019-04-20 22:51:17,Twokinds,I'm losing weight fast though.
5182,2019-04-20 22:51:28,Twokinds,Soon I shall be beach body ready
5192,2019-04-20 22:51:58,Twokinds,3lb
5204,2019-04-20 22:52:43,Twokinds,Probably none
5226,2019-04-20 22:55:07,Twokinds,50
5229,2019-04-20 22:55:21,Twokinds,Yes
5237,2019-04-20 22:56:03,Twokinds,1000
5246,2019-04-20 22:56:27,Twokinds,50

5272,2019-04-20 22:59:32,Twokinds,Mwahahahaha
5273,2019-04-20 22:59:38,Twokinds,Alexa remind me to break hearts
5310,2019-04-20 23:04:21,Twokinds,"House... But In A Fantasy Universe: ""I dunno what's wrong with you, have a healing potion. Not working? Have an antidote."" Series over."
6,2019-04-21 01:21:05,Twokinds,How old is rose again... lol
7,2019-04-21 01:21:31,Twokinds,Oh righ
12,2019-04-21 01:23:45,Twokinds,Honestly sometimes the fans know better than me.
17,2019-04-21 01:26:12,Twokinds,She is probably about 28
18,2019-04-21 01:26:58,Twokinds,"She was 8-9 in the flashbacks when euchre went off to the Templar college, and it probably took a year or two for Euchre to get together with Mary and make Raine."
19,2019-04-21 01:27:03,Twokinds,And then Raine is 18 right now.
20,2019-04-21 01:30:25,Twokinds,...
21,2019-04-21 01:30:32,Twokinds,How tall would you say Rose is?
40,2019-04-21 01:39:21,Twokinds,She's hunched over
43,2019-04-21 01:39:49,Twokinds,Cause she old
44,2019-04-21 01:40:19,Twokinds,I'll say 5'11
45,2019-04-21 01:40:48,Twokinds,Much lighter than Raine though.
58,2019-04-21 01:46:51,Twokinds,Rose is much skinnier than Raine
62,2019-04-21 01:47:39,Twokinds,Yeah but you can see it when she's young too
64,2019-04-21 01:47:52,Twokinds,Very little fat on her bones
66,2019-04-21 01:48:15,Twokinds,Indeed
70,2019-04-21 01:50:08,Twokinds,"No, 30 seems about right."
74,2019-04-21 01:55:13,Twokinds,"20 is average, but most Keidran that make it out of childhood can live to be 20 - 30"
77,2019-04-21 01:55:31,Twokinds,Just as human lifespan is around 68 or something but technically humans can live to be 100.
79,2019-04-21 01:56:02,Twokinds,A 30 year old Keidran is like seeing a 115 year old human. Pretty rare.
82,2019-04-21 01:56:19,Twokinds,Euchre is suspiciously youthful.
105,2019-04-21 02:27:10,Twokinds,I'm trying to figure out how to describe Rose and Saria's friendship.
108,2019-04-21 02:30:02,Twokinds,pff
116,2019-04-21 02:36:25,Twokinds,Let me check...
119,2019-04-21 02:39:19,Twokinds,"Ah, I see."
120,2019-04-21 02:39:22,Twokinds,It was in the final round.
121,2019-04-21 02:39:55,Twokinds,"Because I switched Tom's Pick and Vote, the final round was just a Tom Pick and didn't get voted on."
122,2019-04-21 02:40:01,Twokinds,I'll make sure that doesn't happen again.
125,2019-04-21 02:42:10,Twokinds,Yeah
134,2019-04-21 02:47:43,Twokinds,"Yeah, Saria and Rose loved each other very deeply, in a platonic sense. They were extremely close."
143,2019-04-21 02:53:38,Twokinds,"Yeah, they'd be on the final round"
144,2019-04-21 02:54:26,Twokinds,Keidran are more open than humans. Their definition of platonic might be more flexible.
147,2019-04-21 03:01:31,Twokinds,Yeah.
158,2019-04-21 03:14:17,Twokinds,rose personality...
160,2019-04-21 03:16:16,Twokinds,What's... enjoys messing with people...
177,2019-04-21 03:29:32,Twokinds,Could be
198,2019-04-21 04:02:47,Twokinds,Saria: Good Puppy! PET PET Rose: ???
203,2019-04-21 04:09:38,Twokinds,Well the ref sheet is finally done so I can sleep

205,2019-04-21 04:09:43,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
208,2019-04-21 04:10:10,Twokinds,Yeah I noticed right before posting
267,2019-04-21 21:09:57,Twokinds,Darn it I misinterpreted this sketch suggestion I think
270,2019-04-21 21:21:23,Twokinds,"I had Natani defending Keith from attackers, but they had competitors."
271,2019-04-21 21:21:29,Twokinds,Which might mean something different...
273,2019-04-21 21:22:41,Twokinds,I took it seriously
277,2019-04-21 21:26:16,Twokinds,Yeah I'm going to keep it this way
278,2019-04-21 21:26:20,Twokinds,Sorry Storymaker2
279,2019-04-21 21:26:27,Twokinds,I think they won't mind
307,2019-04-21 21:36:43,Twokinds,Feral form doesn't really exist anymore
308,2019-04-21 21:36:48,Twokinds,Feral is completely different
345,2019-04-21 22:05:29,Twokinds,Actually I went ahead and made two versions

73,2019-04-22 11:02:02,Twokinds,The post scheduler got mixed up
76,2019-04-22 11:02:28,Twokinds,It had to happen eventually
80,2019-04-22 11:04:18,Twokinds,Oops I already did
82,2019-04-22 11:04:51,Twokinds,I mean whatever it was on the stream
85,2019-04-22 11:05:44,Twokinds,I unpublished it.
87,2019-04-22 11:05:59,Twokinds,It'll be posted tomorrow
105,2019-04-22 11:20:19,Twokinds,The Adelaide sketch was unfinished.
106,2019-04-22 11:20:26,Twokinds,Tomorrow the finished version will be posted. XD
107,2019-04-22 11:20:50,Twokinds,( I cleaned it up some more so now the version will be different than the one posted today lol )
110,2019-04-22 11:24:12,Twokinds,Honestly all I did was make the background characters not have circles for faces
116,2019-04-22 12:43:51,Twokinds,How tall would you say red is?
118,2019-04-22 12:46:08,Twokinds,"5'7""? That seems a bit short"
120,2019-04-22 12:47:48,Twokinds,Well that's a big difference
122,2019-04-22 12:48:17,Twokinds,I'm just trying to figure out if he's taller or shorter than rose
124,2019-04-22 12:49:29,Twokinds,Yeah
125,2019-04-22 12:49:45,Twokinds,He's taller than Trace
130,2019-04-22 12:54:19,Twokinds,All the heights started out shorter because I was younger and shorter when I started.
131,2019-04-22 12:54:44,Twokinds,Everyone's sorta either grown a little or shrunk a little to make them more different from one another over time.
140,2019-04-22 12:59:44,Twokinds,Yeah for sure
142,2019-04-22 13:01:41,Twokinds,Thanks!
146,2019-04-22 13:15:25,Twokinds,I imagine him being 5'10
155,2019-04-22 13:20:37,Twokinds,Have I ever drawn Red as a kid?
158,2019-04-22 13:20:57,Twokinds,First time for everything then!
166,2019-04-22 13:22:27,Twokinds,So detailed!

215,2019-04-22 14:05:07,Twokinds,Also I saw that Mippy! Thank you
218,2019-04-22 14:05:22,Twokinds,Yeah making up for the comic missed this weekend
219,2019-04-22 14:05:31,Twokinds,I'm not going to have it go without a new page
224,2019-04-22 14:05:58,Twokinds,I really appreciate it.
295,2019-04-22 14:52:59,Twokinds,The reason I had to do a filler Sunday was because I was actually spending time with my family over the weekend.
296,2019-04-22 14:53:15,Twokinds,There just wasn't enough time left over to draw a whole comic so the filler was necessary
388,2019-04-22 15:12:54,Twokinds,Cause he cut it like that?
400,2019-04-22 15:14:24,Twokinds,lol
401,2019-04-22 15:14:31,Twokinds,"If you're wondering how I came up with it, I don't know."

3647,2019-05-11 21:00:17,Twokinds,But those were the top 7
3653,2019-05-11 21:00:32,Twokinds,7th place was actually a 4 way tie
3660,2019-05-11 21:00:49,Twokinds,But I just put Clovis Ref to add to all the other refs
3674,2019-05-11 21:01:32,Twokinds,#1

3767,2019-05-11 21:06:39,Twokinds,Her human form isn't canon though.
3768,2019-05-11 21:06:49,Twokinds,"In the comic, she specifically avoids mortal forms."
3825,2019-05-11 21:10:39,Twokinds,And that's all folk!

50,2019-05-12 02:08:29,Twokinds,I've never broken a bone. Hope I never do.
53,2019-05-12 02:16:35,Twokinds,A lot?!
54,2019-05-12 02:16:39,Twokinds,Seems like a bad idea.
83,2019-05-12 02:31:54,Twokinds,I guess it is a bit.
99,2019-05-12 02:49:08,Twokinds,I suppose I could add a background if it was Nora Carded.

156,2019-05-12 13:11:55,Twokinds,It's perfect
158,2019-05-12 13:32:42,Twokinds,lol no
159,2019-05-12 13:32:53,Twokinds,Unless you consider Keith faceplanting snow to be special.
162,2019-05-12 13:47:05,Twokinds,Whatever
181,2019-05-12 16:50:17,Twokinds,I hate staff meetings
191,2019-05-12 21:06:50,Twokinds,What's Keith's weight...
193,2019-05-12 21:08:27,Twokinds,Wow that's light
202,2019-05-12 21:38:28,Twokinds,I feel like maybe 160 might be more reasonable.
203,2019-05-12 21:38:51,Twokinds,150 - 160
228,2019-05-12 21:53:33,Twokinds,I hate that!
237,2019-05-12 22:55:35,Twokinds,I saw the albion squirrel this morning again
248,2019-05-12 23:07:17,Twokinds,"Hm, I don't really have much to say about Keith"
250,2019-05-12 23:11:35,Twokinds,Yeah. Exactly.
251,2019-05-12 23:11:40,Twokinds,He's just a Keith.
252,2019-05-12 23:13:15,Twokinds,A lot of his background has already been covered in the comic itself.
253,2019-05-12 23:13:26,Twokinds,There isn't a lot of fun facts I can add.
256,2019-05-12 23:21:24,Twokinds,Of course not.
257,2019-05-12 23:21:32,Twokinds,He's German.
260,2019-05-12 23:25:44,Twokinds,I can't just make something up.
261,2019-05-12 23:25:47,Twokinds,What if it's not true?
264,2019-05-12 23:27:45,Twokinds,I only write it like I see it.
78,2019-05-13 17:42:38,Twokinds,o/
79,2019-05-13 17:43:04,Twokinds,I return from my doctor's appointment.
84,2019-05-13 17:44:24,Twokinds,"Good! They said I am literally the most healthy person on the planet, and I should expect to live forever."
91,2019-05-13 17:47:28,Twokinds,XD
92,2019-05-13 17:47:37,Twokinds,Wanna know when the last time I saw my doctor was?
95,2019-05-13 17:48:02,Twokinds,2010.
99,2019-05-13 17:48:31,Twokinds,Yeah I had no idea it was that long ago.
103,2019-05-13 17:49:39,Twokinds,"But my health is the same as always. Blood pressure's the same, weight is the same. So basically I'm great."
108,2019-05-13 17:50:12,Twokinds,He does?
225,2019-05-13 18:34:41,Twokinds,Yeah.
226,2019-05-13 18:34:59,Twokinds,5 for 5 would actually mean 5+tax usually
228,2019-05-13 18:35:21,Twokinds,"The only exception is food, and only if you don't eat there."
230,2019-05-13 18:36:12,Twokinds,"Or wait, do they? I don't remember now."
231,2019-05-13 18:36:18,Twokinds,"But yeah, it's annoying"
232,2019-05-13 18:36:24,Twokinds,I wish prices were just what was listed.
233,2019-05-13 18:36:29,Twokinds,Would make using money way easier.
237,2019-05-13 18:37:49,Twokinds,It was so easy in Korea
239,2019-05-13 18:38:23,Twokinds,"If something said 1000 won, it was 1000 won. You just give one bill or coin and go on your way."
240,2019-05-13 18:38:31,Twokinds,So much better.
241,2019-05-13 18:38:37,Twokinds,"And yes, pennies need to be abolished."
244,2019-05-13 18:38:58,Twokinds,"In fact, get rid of nickles too."
264,2019-05-13 18:44:48,Twokinds,"Outside of the US, I've been to Korea and Germany."
25,2019-05-14 12:56:24,Twokinds,It takes me literally all day to fill out these ref sheets. Two in a row is too much.
29,2019-05-14 12:57:19,Twokinds,I had a doctor's apointment yesterday. With the next Nibbly comic coming out today there was just no time.
45,2019-05-14 14:06:33,Twokinds,There's 3 pages left
48,2019-05-14 14:10:05,Twokinds,"Yes, there will be a break. The next one isn't quite ready."
49,2019-05-14 14:10:38,Twokinds,"I'd hoped it would but, or I could come up with some smaller ones."
50,2019-05-14 14:10:50,Twokinds,"Unfortunately, I've kinda has some writer's block lately."
55,2019-05-14 14:16:52,Twokinds,lol how do you think I feel!
56,2019-05-14 14:17:04,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-floAAA:

100,2019-05-14 14:52:48,Twokinds,Yeah true
108,2019-05-14 14:58:56,Twokinds,Heheh
109,2019-05-14 14:59:11,Twokinds,"Half the time when I try to write dialogue, I think to myself ""how do I say my ideas in English"""
110,2019-05-14 14:59:50,Twokinds,It's sometimes tricky to translate a concept that seems simple into a story with words that flow well.
114,2019-05-14 15:00:38,Twokinds,"Yeah, double meanings must be hard."
137,2019-05-14 15:36:53,Twokinds,179!
138,2019-05-14 15:37:22,Twokinds,"I'm finally in the 170's again, barely."
140,2019-05-14 15:56:39,Twokinds,?
141,2019-05-14 15:56:56,Twokinds,XD It's just nice to make progress.
142,2019-05-14 15:57:04,Twokinds,Or at least see it.
145,2019-05-14 15:58:07,Twokinds,81.2kg
147,2019-05-14 16:05:43,Twokinds,Having a scale certainly helps.
148,2019-05-14 16:05:53,Twokinds,I also have a body fat monitor.
150,2019-05-14 16:07:00,Twokinds,"Eh, it's not very accurate. But it gives at least an impression."
153,2019-05-14 16:11:53,Twokinds,Haha yeah
156,2019-05-14 16:12:43,Twokinds,"Yeah, I can see that. It's hard to tell if such devices actually do what they claim."
157,2019-05-14 16:13:28,Twokinds,Probably the best way to test body fat is the pinch test. But I don't know how to do it. Nor do I have the calipers.
158,2019-05-14 16:13:47,Twokinds,"I'm just happy I can wear my belt without it being uncomfortable now, once again."

4,2019-05-15 01:48:49,Twokinds,Uh... that's a good question.
5,2019-05-15 01:49:38,Twokinds,Do animals feel their horns? I don't know.
10,2019-05-15 01:51:46,Twokinds,I assume Nora can feel them like I can feel my teeth.
27,2019-05-15 02:19:59,Twokinds,I haven't worn a dress since prom either.
33,2019-05-15 02:37:43,Twokinds,who cares about salmon that much?
35,2019-05-15 02:39:55,Twokinds,"Phew, I think I'm done with the Nora sheet."
41,2019-05-15 02:45:49,Twokinds,I'm always afraid there is not enough info
42,2019-05-15 02:45:55,Twokinds,But there's a lot of info on here
43,2019-05-15 02:46:13,Twokinds,Stupid giant Nora's giant tail and wings made it hard to fit the text.
46,2019-05-15 02:49:37,Twokinds,I want all the ref sheets to be the same size

144,2019-05-18 14:57:42,Twokinds,The whole voting system is in flux this week
145,2019-05-18 14:57:46,Twokinds,This month
146,2019-05-18 14:57:55,Twokinds,I'm going to see about having some open votes again
147,2019-05-18 14:57:59,Twokinds,But I'm not sure how it'd work
171,2019-05-18 15:01:25,Twokinds,A lot of results
172,2019-05-18 15:01:47,Twokinds,There were over 300 ballots
180,2019-05-18 15:02:12,Twokinds,"Which is good. The more people voting, the more fair it is."
183,2019-05-18 15:02:38,Twokinds,Mostly because a lot of people don't watch the streams
184,2019-05-18 15:02:47,Twokinds,24 vote has much more opportunity
185,2019-05-18 15:02:51,Twokinds,24hour
213,2019-05-18 15:09:45,Twokinds,Are we on?
219,2019-05-18 15:09:57,Twokinds,Weird
221,2019-05-18 15:10:00,Twokinds,It says I'm live
271,2019-05-18 15:12:32,Twokinds,"Okay, I don't really have a good way to announce the winners"
362,2019-05-18 15:18:38,Twokinds,"So... #1, with 127 votes: ""Flora getting excited about the changes pregnancy is making to her chest. She's not flat anymore! She decides to try and brag it up to Kat."""
389,2019-05-18 15:20:52,Twokinds,My hands are frozen
392,2019-05-18 15:21:05,Twokinds,It's very hard to draw when my hands are cold
431,2019-05-18 15:24:22,Twokinds,I'm trying to figure out a good way to export a graph of the results
433,2019-05-18 15:24:33,Twokinds,Right now I don't know excel well enough to know how to do it
444,2019-05-18 15:25:16,Twokinds,The problem is google's default graph is really ugly
445,2019-05-18 15:25:26,Twokinds,The names don't show up for half of them unless you hovor over them
447,2019-05-18 15:25:35,Twokinds,So a screenshot isn't really helpful
454,2019-05-18 15:26:14,Twokinds,Nope
457,2019-05-18 15:26:17,Twokinds,Not that I can tell
462,2019-05-18 15:26:52,Twokinds,Because then everyone would see everyone's username
464,2019-05-18 15:26:57,Twokinds,And some people want to be anonymous
479,2019-05-18 15:29:01,Twokinds,I just need to figure out how to do it
480,2019-05-18 15:29:16,Twokinds,I'm sure if I do enough googling I'll find out how to seperate tons of text into seperate cells
484,2019-05-18 15:29:40,Twokinds,Because google outputs all the pics as text in one cell
487,2019-05-18 15:29:53,Twokinds,per submitter
491,2019-05-18 15:31:05,Twokinds,I wonder if COUNTIF can use variables
493,2019-05-18 15:31:11,Twokinds,Cause that could work
545,2019-05-18 15:35:49,Twokinds,The problem is countif doesn't count if there's more text
547,2019-05-18 15:35:57,Twokinds,Oh
548,2019-05-18 15:36:00,Twokinds,Does stars work?
551,2019-05-18 15:36:09,Twokinds,Okay! That could work
688,2019-05-18 15:50:00,Twokinds,Kat can't.
710,2019-05-18 15:51:46,Twokinds,Kat wants to have a family but can't make one of her own
768,2019-05-18 15:55:54,Twokinds,"Nice, I'll look into making the graph"

1560,2019-05-18 17:08:07,Twokinds,Not sure
1574,2019-05-18 17:09:05,Twokinds,"Uh, I was 194lbs, now I'm 177lb"
1576,2019-05-18 17:09:09,Twokinds,Someone translate that
1595,2019-05-18 17:10:28,Twokinds,I've been fine so far
1629,2019-05-18 17:13:10,Twokinds,Sugar is next to unavoidable
1631,2019-05-18 17:13:24,Twokinds,"Even with my extreme version of the diet, I can't avoid it completely."
1635,2019-05-18 17:13:32,Twokinds,So there's probably no danger of having too little.
1664,2019-05-18 17:17:28,Twokinds,"It's pretty bad, but I've felt worse"
1865,2019-05-18 17:35:52,Twokinds,Huh

2174,2019-05-18 18:02:52,Twokinds,Because she's still based on Kat

2254,2019-05-18 18:10:01,Twokinds,My pc is struggling

2263,2019-05-18 18:10:43,Twokinds,Barbarian Raine seems fun
2399,2019-05-18 18:32:17,Twokinds,I don't think Mike or Evals have ever shown an attraction for Kat at all.
2410,2019-05-18 18:33:27,Twokinds,"Which is odd, because they're both kinda horndogs, Evals especially, but I guess they just don't even consider her in that context."

2477,2019-05-18 18:41:56,Twokinds,XD

4032,2019-05-18 22:07:52,Twokinds,It's pretty huge
4033,2019-05-18 22:07:59,Twokinds,And was kind of a pain to put together
4034,2019-05-18 22:08:28,Twokinds,http://twokindscomic.com/images/omnipoll20190519.png
4039,2019-05-18 22:11:18,Twokinds,"Kat against glass was originally lower than Birbkinds, but more people voted after the stream started, pushing it above Birb."
4044,2019-05-18 22:12:49,Twokinds,Yeah they didn't get voted on nearly as much as last time either. Except for... Tom for some reason. Whhhyyy
4048,2019-05-18 22:13:15,Twokinds,"I hope they realize it won't be a ME reference sheet, but the background delivery guy. XD"
4054,2019-05-18 22:13:46,Twokinds,No
4056,2019-05-18 22:13:52,Twokinds,Votes weren't counted after the stream started
4057,2019-05-18 22:14:00,Twokinds,But people could still vote.
4058,2019-05-18 22:14:16,Twokinds,So the numbers changed a little.
4061,2019-05-18 22:14:48,Twokinds,They're roughly accurate
4063,2019-05-18 22:14:59,Twokinds,There was only a few extra votes after we started
4064,2019-05-18 22:15:14,Twokinds,"Bad, I just forgot to close the votes down it wasn't on purpose."
4067,2019-05-18 22:16:20,Twokinds,I dunno?
4076,2019-05-18 22:18:39,Twokinds,Yeah overall I like this voting system
4079,2019-05-18 22:18:54,Twokinds,"But I do feel like it misses out on the ""Audience participation"" part of the stream"
4082,2019-05-18 22:19:56,Twokinds,"Yeah, waaaay more participants"
4119,2019-05-18 22:34:28,Twokinds,No prob!

4152,2019-05-18 22:44:57,Twokinds,I can't really say
4153,2019-05-18 22:45:10,Twokinds,"Honestly, I'm often surprised what people choose"
4154,2019-05-18 22:45:19,Twokinds,So I'm no good at guessing
