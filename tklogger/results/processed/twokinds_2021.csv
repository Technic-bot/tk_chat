730,2021-01-01 02:15:48,Twokinds,It's easy to write 'cow' in the script but it's another thing to draw.

515,2021-01-21 22:24:42,Twokinds,Sketch suggestions
590,2021-01-21 22:34:17,Twokinds,Just 5
610,2021-01-21 22:39:54,Twokinds,I've always thought the idea of classes was kind of rigid and unrealistic.
612,2021-01-21 22:40:06,Twokinds,I'm not sure what I'd be.
633,2021-01-21 22:42:21,Twokinds,I'm certainly no fan of politics.
636,2021-01-21 22:42:33,Twokinds,Though an easy life appeals to me.
650,2021-01-21 22:43:16,Twokinds,I don't wanna be a steet urchin XD
652,2021-01-21 22:43:20,Twokinds,I don't wanna deal with anyone
660,2021-01-21 22:43:44,Twokinds,I think I'd be pretty miserable in a fantasy world.

28,2021-01-22 00:08:05,Twokinds,I should stress most Adrakist don't look like Sarah
36,2021-01-22 00:08:59,Twokinds,They're just dragon worshipers. 90% don't change themselves.
46,2021-01-22 00:09:39,Twokinds,A small percentage try to look like dragons. Most have just small things like dragon claws.
49,2021-01-22 00:09:56,Twokinds,Maybe 5 percent go as far as Sarah.
235,2021-01-22 00:46:15,Twokinds,Done
267,2021-01-22 00:48:41,Twokinds,"Just to clarify, in the Twokinds world, ""drake"" is just what they call male dragons. It's not a lower type of dragon or anything."
371,2021-01-22 01:06:04,Twokinds,I was such an idiot - I misread a suggestion
377,2021-01-22 01:06:37,Twokinds,I thought it said Adrakist Flora and Sarah. But it said Adrakist Flora and Wrinry.
378,2021-01-22 01:06:41,Twokinds,So now I'm drawing this.
392,2021-01-22 01:07:24,Twokinds,Well they're both half dragons. I guess I got them mixed up in my head.
395,2021-01-22 01:07:35,Twokinds,Maybe this is Flora continuing to explore the Adrakist compound.
400,2021-01-22 01:07:51,Twokinds,And... Wrinry is there cause they assumed she was an adrakist too.
404,2021-01-22 01:07:59,Twokinds,Not realizing she's a full dragon in disguise.
432,2021-01-22 01:11:24,Twokinds,I actually can't remember how old I planned Sivil to be
452,2021-01-22 01:17:34,Twokinds,He is sworn to do that.
500,2021-01-22 01:27:09,Twokinds,"I mean, yeah, she comes from a city of dragons. They don't normally wear clothes."

578,2021-01-22 01:43:40,Twokinds,I don't remember what warlocks are
595,2021-01-22 01:46:51,Twokinds,Oh yeah
596,2021-01-22 01:46:53,Twokinds,No
598,2021-01-22 01:46:58,Twokinds,I don't like being beholden to anyone.
599,2021-01-22 01:47:08,Twokinds,I would not be a warlock
626,2021-01-22 01:54:47,Twokinds,I'd definitely be some sort of elf just for the lifespan
630,2021-01-22 01:55:09,Twokinds,Living forever is certainly prefereable to not living forever.
631,2021-01-22 01:55:21,Twokinds,Plus no sleep
667,2021-01-22 02:00:23,Twokinds,Done
675,2021-01-22 02:00:48,Twokinds,I need to be a hivemind of warforges.

740,2021-01-22 02:21:27,Twokinds,Yeah well I don't like the idea of being beholden to any being.
742,2021-01-22 02:21:49,Twokinds,There's no freedom.
745,2021-01-22 02:22:42,Twokinds,I would if I could!

1633,2021-02-06 17:18:22,Twokinds,Depends on the song
1635,2021-02-06 17:18:35,Twokinds,I don't listen to a lot of music so I might not get it
1647,2021-02-06 17:19:30,Twokinds,"I don't care for music, no."
1815,2021-02-06 17:43:30,Twokinds,"For some reason my randomizer keeps repeating songs. Which I know is true random, but is still odd when it's picking between hundreds of songs"
1822,2021-02-06 17:44:04,Twokinds,youtube used to do random shuffle.
1823,2021-02-06 17:44:11,Twokinds,But now it just picks one at random.

4125,2021-02-06 22:12:42,Twokinds,"I mean, I guess she can be Fauna. If I can't think of anything else."
4188,2021-02-06 22:15:43,Twokinds,Most of the tigers have flower names
4211,2021-02-06 22:16:42,Twokinds,She could be lily or daisy
4227,2021-02-06 22:17:07,Twokinds,There's already well known characters named daisy but tht's fine
4233,2021-02-06 22:17:24,Twokinds,Hm.....
4244,2021-02-06 22:17:53,Twokinds,Lilly would be fine

4325,2021-02-06 22:21:31,Twokinds,Sakura is already a very common Japanese name.
4344,2021-02-06 22:22:55,Twokinds,I'll figure it out later

154,2021-02-08 18:57:27,Twokinds,Not for myself!
157,2021-02-08 18:57:41,Twokinds,I built a new pc as a gift for my stepmother.
160,2021-02-08 18:58:09,Twokinds,"It's a budget build, but other than the graphics card, it's pretty beefy"
163,2021-02-08 19:00:09,Twokinds,"She's only going to use it for word processing, so I put an old Geforce 660 in there, but everything else is pretty modern. Ryzen 3600, 16GB Ram, 1TB m.2"
164,2021-02-08 19:00:36,Twokinds,"If you swapped out the old graphics card with a newer one, it could totally play modern games no prob."
166,2021-02-08 19:01:09,Twokinds,Was about a $700 build. Booted up first try!
171,2021-02-08 19:07:29,Twokinds,"Uh, I decided to start this weekend."
172,2021-02-08 19:07:38,Twokinds,"Got all the parts monday, built it today."
182,2021-02-08 19:14:29,Twokinds,XD
183,2021-02-08 19:14:41,Twokinds,Probably the smoothest build I've ever done
184,2021-02-08 19:14:52,Twokinds,"Just... everything worked, first try."
185,2021-02-08 19:15:00,Twokinds,Even installing windows was easy.
190,2021-02-08 19:15:32,Twokinds,"I did indeed, though I always do in anticipation that something is gunna go wrong and need changing."
215,2021-02-08 19:25:12,Twokinds,Getting windows and software was suuuuuch a pain in the olden days.
216,2021-02-08 19:25:20,Twokinds,Back when you had to manually search for every single driver
228,2021-02-08 19:27:21,Twokinds,"Yeah PCs were waaay more expensive back then, too."
229,2021-02-08 19:27:29,Twokinds,PC building is way nicer these days.
233,2021-02-08 19:27:49,Twokinds,And it's all the graphics card XD

237,2021-02-08 19:28:14,Twokinds,Here's my build.
241,2021-02-08 19:29:02,Twokinds,Pretty basic stuff.
244,2021-02-08 19:29:23,Twokinds,I can't believe how cheap m.2s are
246,2021-02-08 19:29:36,Twokinds,It was only a few years ago they were really high end
252,2021-02-08 19:30:19,Twokinds,"Yeah it's funny, I way prefer this simple look to the flashy, LED covered ""High end"" stuff"
259,2021-02-08 19:32:21,Twokinds,I considered prebuilt just to save time but I really didn't need a lot of the stuff the prebuilt come with.
260,2021-02-08 19:32:24,Twokinds,They usually cater to gamers.
261,2021-02-08 19:32:28,Twokinds,And my stepmom is not a gamer.
264,2021-02-08 19:33:23,Twokinds,haha
265,2021-02-08 19:33:29,Twokinds,She does play cards online a lot
266,2021-02-08 19:33:36,Twokinds,which I guess is technically gaming
271,2021-02-08 19:34:08,Twokinds,Never heard of it

319,2021-02-08 19:46:39,Twokinds,"Honestly, most of my gaming is just whatever Kameloh pulls me into, these days XD"
324,2021-02-08 19:47:07,Twokinds,"I used to exclusively be a singleplayer gamer, but now I just don't have time. I'm always just playing multiplayer stuff. It's weird."

86,2021-02-11 19:05:03,Twokinds,Also book 6.
87,2021-02-11 19:06:33,Twokinds,"I can't believe it, but book 6 goes all the way to Edinmire, with Reni Adira and Maeve. It ends at ch19's start, and then Book 7 is current events."
88,2021-02-11 19:06:51,Twokinds,So the books will finally be caught up with the online comic.

887,2021-02-12 02:21:01,Twokinds,Templar were conducting an experiment that resulted in an island and all it's inhabitants to be blown to bits.
896,2021-02-12 02:21:17,Twokinds,"She's there to investigate what happened, what went wrong, and cover it up."
914,2021-02-12 02:22:24,Twokinds,This is the island that got blowed up
918,2021-02-12 02:22:31,Twokinds,It's constantly being blowed up now.
990,2021-02-12 02:27:56,Twokinds,"Well, it's not supposed to be floating."
999,2021-02-12 02:28:38,Twokinds,It's going to be a fairly large book.
1012,2021-02-12 02:29:26,Twokinds,"At the moment, I'm just writing the story down as text. My plan is to make it into a comic, but for now, just story."
1013,2021-02-12 02:29:29,Twokinds,With pictures.
1025,2021-02-12 02:30:00,Twokinds,Yeah like... light novels. Or prequel. Without the choices.
1035,2021-02-12 02:31:06,Twokinds,"I have all the major story beats mapped out, except for a bit in the middle."
1041,2021-02-12 02:31:36,Twokinds,We'll see. I'm really hoping to get this one out by this year.
1058,2021-02-12 02:33:03,Twokinds,The timescale is more for my sake
1060,2021-02-12 02:33:12,Twokinds,I have trouble with infinite deadlines
1067,2021-02-12 02:33:49,Twokinds,"Don't worry, definitely not. XD"
1074,2021-02-12 02:34:08,Twokinds,It's actually probably not going to look like that. There's no mountain on it in the final story.
1076,2021-02-12 02:34:23,Twokinds,"I drew this concept art a few months ago, back when I had a vague idea whta the island looked like."
1078,2021-02-12 02:34:35,Twokinds,But there's only a large hill where the templar research facility sits.
1105,2021-02-12 02:38:22,Twokinds,"Alright, I'm heading off to go back to writing"

3455,2021-02-20 22:25:32,Twokinds,All the ones I've spoken to have told me they can't.

3496,2021-02-20 22:31:24,Twokinds,"she was one of the original cast for the comic that willow, magpie, windstraw, etc came from"
3501,2021-02-20 22:31:48,Twokinds,She kept the books and ran numbers for the Riftwall tavern Amelia ran.
3512,2021-02-20 22:33:30,Twokinds,yeah
3540,2021-02-20 22:36:04,Twokinds,oh yeah she's extremely thin
3551,2021-02-20 22:37:55,Twokinds,oh yeah
3554,2021-02-20 22:38:11,Twokinds,She's a grandmother
3587,2021-02-20 22:41:30,Twokinds,This was an old draft of the cast from that comic
3602,2021-02-20 22:42:30,Twokinds,The bird was still really wip
3605,2021-02-20 22:42:40,Twokinds,I knew I wanted a bird character but didn't have much of a design yet.
3615,2021-02-20 22:43:01,Twokinds,Magpie is a Basitin yes
3625,2021-02-20 22:44:05,Twokinds,"Magpie is extremely removed from her original ancestors. So she ends up mixing and matching western and eastern customs, putting on the white paint mostly just for tourists."
3630,2021-02-20 22:44:34,Twokinds,"She doesn't really know what any of it is, and the words she writes on herself are mostly gibberish."
3639,2021-02-20 22:45:13,Twokinds,"She doesn't know what original Basitins are like, and most people don't either, so it's all for show."
3661,2021-02-20 22:47:19,Twokinds,Vivian would need major redesign work since she was never finished.
3674,2021-02-20 22:48:33,Twokinds,I was going for a griffin thing yeah but was never happy with it
3676,2021-02-20 22:48:38,Twokinds,Cause I'm not good at drawing birds
3696,2021-02-20 22:49:40,Twokinds,I can't do that cause Fluff's current DnD char is an owl XD

3879,2021-02-20 23:14:47,Twokinds,Confronting Willow's mother would not be a good idea.

3898,2021-02-20 23:16:14,Twokinds,Hi Kameloh again! :spaghetti:
3920,2021-02-20 23:18:14,Twokinds,That'd be too hard as a sketch suggestion
3951,2021-02-20 23:22:16,Twokinds,yeah
3965,2021-02-20 23:23:09,Twokinds,Thanks!
3974,2021-02-20 23:24:01,Twokinds,lol well she's like in her 60's
3980,2021-02-20 23:24:48,Twokinds,That's why I figured a cane would be appropriate
3991,2021-02-20 23:25:55,Twokinds,It was originally a different universe
4005,2021-02-20 23:27:24,Twokinds,I don't recall if she ever did have a name
4013,2021-02-20 23:28:00,Twokinds,Fine she's... Olivia
4236,2021-02-20 23:58:23,Twokinds,Those were her wings
4240,2021-02-20 23:58:52,Twokinds,"Actually, I don't think I can really come up with her design full right now during the stream."
4246,2021-02-20 23:59:09,Twokinds,I can tell you what her backstory was
16,2021-02-21 00:01:44,Twokinds,There once was born a very beautiful dragon. One of the very first.
23,2021-02-21 00:02:19,Twokinds,"At and early age she had a fear of death. When her mother assured her she was biologically immortal, and would almost certainly live for centuries, she only became more terrified"
24,2021-02-21 00:02:30,Twokinds,"as it meant unlike other creatures with finite lives, when she died, she would have missed out on infinite potential."
29,2021-02-21 00:04:04,Twokinds,So she looked for ways to keep herself safe. She hid herself away and eventually found safety and power when she started feeding on black magic.
35,2021-02-21 00:04:32,Twokinds,"Instead of going out herself, she used her shapeshifting to split parts of herself off, while her main body remained safe."
39,2021-02-21 00:04:55,Twokinds,"At first only a little at a time, but then more and more over the years"
45,2021-02-21 00:05:29,Twokinds,"Over time she resembled less and less of a dragon, and began losing her sanity as she tore herself into more and more pieces every time she grew, eventually becoming the source of the fey in the forest."
47,2021-02-21 00:05:34,Twokinds,The end! :D
74,2021-02-21 00:07:24,Twokinds,No willow is independant from her mother
80,2021-02-21 00:07:48,Twokinds,Dragons are being of magic.
83,2021-02-21 00:08:04,Twokinds,"But willow's mother has fed on black magic for so long, she's literally made of black magic now."
91,2021-02-21 00:08:53,Twokinds,"She sends out her little versions of herself, the fey creatures, to go find new sources of black magic crystals."
95,2021-02-21 00:09:04,Twokinds,"It does, but it doens't kill a dragon like it does mortals."
104,2021-02-21 00:10:06,Twokinds,The parts of her that go out sometimes end up getting lost and then become indepenant.
107,2021-02-21 00:10:32,Twokinds,"That's what happened to willow, and that's what would happen to willow's body if she left it somewhere for long enoguh."
109,2021-02-21 00:10:45,Twokinds,Black magic is just souls.
111,2021-02-21 00:10:51,Twokinds,It's the life force of other things.
113,2021-02-21 00:11:13,Twokinds,Willows go out and tempt travelers to their death to capture their souls and bring them back.
117,2021-02-21 00:11:51,Twokinds,"Anyway, I'm gunna finish this one later. see if I can draw it better."
129,2021-02-21 00:12:54,Twokinds,"I do have old versions of willow's mom, but I never liked how it looked. Could never get her to look right"
135,2021-02-21 00:13:19,Twokinds,one sec I'll find them
182,2021-02-21 00:15:58,Twokinds,"In the story, she never confronts the characters in person until the very end. Until then, she just sends proxy versions of herself, like the anthro version there."
191,2021-02-21 00:17:03,Twokinds,It was a long time ago
194,2021-02-21 00:17:17,Twokinds,"Unfortunately, even though it gets suggested a lot, I just don't have time to work on it right now XD"
228,2021-02-21 00:21:59,Twokinds,She's probably too far gone. She'd likely die if cut off from her black magic now.
250,2021-02-21 00:26:00,Twokinds,That'd be quite the effort in itself
336,2021-02-21 00:35:13,Twokinds,"She's definitely evil, but she doesn't see herself as evil."
343,2021-02-21 00:35:40,Twokinds,"She still sees herself as a glorious dragon. It's why the Willow's don't outright kill people, then just... cause accidents."
344,2021-02-21 00:35:52,Twokinds,She'd never just kill someone.
351,2021-02-21 00:36:22,Twokinds,"Well, they do. But she thinks she's good."
352,2021-02-21 00:36:25,Twokinds,She's clearly not.
355,2021-02-21 00:36:48,Twokinds,Yeah she has a lot of control over her forest.
359,2021-02-21 00:37:03,Twokinds,"Outside of her forest, her willow's don't have as much power to manupulate fate."
367,2021-02-21 00:37:42,Twokinds,"Well, yeah. She did."
372,2021-02-21 00:38:08,Twokinds,"If she actually went to her mother like this, she would be reobsorbed and all the power she gained while out and about would be added to her mother."
379,2021-02-21 00:38:56,Twokinds,"It just happens, Willow doesn't mean for any of the bad stuff that happens around her."
380,2021-02-21 00:39:01,Twokinds,It's just automatic.
387,2021-02-21 00:39:49,Twokinds,lol
390,2021-02-21 00:40:14,Twokinds,"Well it's more like, she unconciously takes one step to the left or right, which causes the person behind her to follow in just a way that she slides down into a pit."
424,2021-02-21 00:43:12,Twokinds,no right now it's just The Mother
440,2021-02-21 00:44:55,Twokinds,Well she is her mother's daughter
590,2021-02-21 00:53:14,Twokinds,Yep! Sorry it ran pretty long today

1171,2021-02-26 03:33:58,Twokinds,It stopped bleeding.

1223,2021-02-26 03:44:11,Twokinds,I made a makeshift bandage. It started bleeding again when I cleaned it.

1257,2021-02-26 03:50:47,Twokinds,Yeah. I'm mostly just worried about infection. I've heard too many medical horror stories that even minor cuts like this leave me paranoid.
1281,2021-02-26 03:58:30,Twokinds,Yeah same
1283,2021-02-26 03:58:49,Twokinds,It's like... don't tell me at 10yo about a tiny creature that can just kill me.

1834,2021-03-01 23:28:42,Twokinds,Went after his jewels

1880,2021-03-01 23:36:53,Twokinds,Need to invent a character with the last name of Lewd and then ask W0lf to draw some art of her.

5,2021-03-02 00:01:30,Twokinds,I still can't believe Photoshop took away the line tool.
18,2021-03-02 00:04:43,Twokinds,Yup
19,2021-03-02 00:04:46,Twokinds,The Pixel line tool
20,2021-03-02 00:04:58,Twokinds,Now you can only make vector lines.
21,2021-03-02 00:05:07,Twokinds,"But if you just want to draw a simple line, the pixel option is greyed out now."
27,2021-03-02 00:05:40,Twokinds,They say it's to bring it in line with their other products
32,2021-03-02 00:06:17,Twokinds,"To make a pixel line now, you have to use the vector line tool, set a weight, then rastorize it. One step per line is now 3, yaaay"
40,2021-03-02 00:06:51,Twokinds,I don't know.
42,2021-03-02 00:06:59,Twokinds,And it seems like they're being really stubborn on it.
69,2021-03-02 00:12:54,Twokinds,"Part of me cynically thinks they tool the line tool away so they can ""fix"" it with the next version"
70,2021-03-02 00:12:58,Twokinds,Gives them something to do.
97,2021-03-02 00:17:23,Twokinds,No
99,2021-03-02 00:17:41,Twokinds,The programs themselves don't have different versions
100,2021-03-02 00:18:02,Twokinds,Their tiers are purely how many programs you get.
101,2021-03-02 00:18:16,Twokinds,"And yeah, I pay $10 per month for photoshop"
110,2021-03-02 00:19:06,Twokinds,Thanks!
115,2021-03-02 00:21:08,Twokinds,"It's good software, they just make boneheaded moves. And also, the program's become so bloated I think they have trouble with it, considering all the bugs every update."
119,2021-03-02 00:21:37,Twokinds,"Photoshop 2021 was extremely poor, regarding bugs."
121,2021-03-02 00:21:50,Twokinds,But they have tools no other program does
124,2021-03-02 00:22:37,Twokinds,I tried CSP a long time ago
125,2021-03-02 00:22:48,Twokinds,"I dunno if things are better now, but they lacked a lot of basic stuff I use regularly."
126,2021-03-02 00:23:01,Twokinds,They didn't even have alignment tools.
137,2021-03-02 00:25:38,Twokinds,I have my eye on affinity photo
140,2021-03-02 00:26:48,Twokinds,The first program to have an ai-driven auto-inking mechnic will take me away instantly. XD

204,2021-03-02 00:53:50,Twokinds,These background kill me
213,2021-03-02 00:59:23,Twokinds,It's difficult
218,2021-03-02 00:59:55,Twokinds,"I have to do it fast so it can't ever be my best work, but at the same time, once you've established a certain level of fidelity, you can't really get too sloppy with it either"

3137,2021-03-06 22:18:16,Twokinds,Maybe changing back and forth would prevent Raine from ever existing at all.

57,2021-03-08 15:24:08,Twokinds,Hi!
69,2021-03-08 15:29:22,Twokinds,"Live is good, Crimson!"
70,2021-03-08 15:29:31,Twokinds,"Life is good, Crimson!"
73,2021-03-08 15:32:32,Twokinds,I make typos sometimes.
76,2021-03-08 15:33:58,Twokinds,"Well, life was good, I guess."
78,2021-03-08 15:34:04,Twokinds,Thanks for bringing me back down.
50,2021-03-11 15:38:23,Twokinds,"Oh shoot, I asked that alerts be turned off."
51,2021-03-11 15:38:28,Twokinds,Sorry
55,2021-03-11 15:39:28,Twokinds,"Patreon is cracking down again. Now, any post containing unclothed characters regardless of context much be labeled adult and Patron Only."
56,2021-03-11 15:39:36,Twokinds,"So, I'm doing a lot of mirroring."
60,2021-03-11 15:41:19,Twokinds,Yeah. I've got a feeling. They better watch themselves. Twitter I've heard is making plans to impement something similiar.
61,2021-03-11 15:41:23,Twokinds,Not that I trust twitter any more
62,2021-03-11 15:41:37,Twokinds,But anyone can look and see what happened to Tumblr
65,2021-03-11 15:42:29,Twokinds,Yeah I've heard that
98,2021-03-11 17:47:41,Twokinds,"Okay, I can't seem to get into contact with iliar, so... I can't turn off the alerts"
99,2021-03-11 17:47:47,Twokinds,This chat might end up spammed.
102,2021-03-11 17:54:20,Twokinds,"Oh, Snowmanwizard"
104,2021-03-11 17:55:53,Twokinds,"Going through my backlog, I actually did a suggestion you made back in November."
105,2021-03-11 17:56:14,Twokinds,"It was the end of the month, I pre-sketched it off-stream thinking you'd suggest it again, and then I'd just pull it out and be like ""Done!"" But then you changed your suggestion."
106,2021-03-11 17:56:34,Twokinds,"So then I just hung on to it, thinking maybe you'd get back to it."
107,2021-03-11 17:57:03,Twokinds,But you never did XD
108,2021-03-11 17:57:20,Twokinds,So I forgot about it
112,2021-03-11 17:58:11,Twokinds,Yeah it was the one with Tigger. Do you still want that one?
114,2021-03-11 17:59:06,Twokinds,"Alright, I'll have it posted once all of this week's are posted, as a bonus sketch, I suppose."
116,2021-03-11 17:59:24,Twokinds,I just feel awkward continuing to hang on to it now. No problem!
132,2021-03-11 19:17:34,Twokinds,It's fine. Don't worry about it
136,2021-03-11 19:31:37,Twokinds,I might not stream tonight since I'm still working out this issue with patreon.
145,2021-03-11 19:36:12,Twokinds,Sorry. Expect like 200 more.
148,2021-03-11 19:40:23,Twokinds,"Ok, thankfully got Nibbly bot to chill"
151,2021-03-11 19:43:22,Twokinds,"No, but any instance where a character is unclothed"
152,2021-03-11 19:43:28,Twokinds,Which is unfortunately a lot
154,2021-03-11 19:44:39,Twokinds,"Practically every Flora and Kathrin piece, except when they're wearing something specific. XD"
156,2021-03-11 19:45:14,Twokinds,Yep
159,2021-03-11 19:45:36,Twokinds,Yeep
163,2021-03-11 19:46:07,Twokinds,"Probably gonna mean a lot more lingerie going forward, but I'm still going to draw characters naked. Just gunna have to be Patrons Only and mirrored."
167,2021-03-11 19:50:34,Twokinds,"I did that just in case. I don't wanna push my luck while they're keeping an eye on me, even though it's technically within their rules."
170,2021-03-11 19:54:22,Twokinds,not really

535,2021-03-12 19:46:05,Twokinds,"It's a little late, I think I'm going to continue drawing sketches from the omnipoll"
536,2021-03-12 19:46:48,Twokinds,Things are a little upside down at the moment
539,2021-03-12 19:49:19,Twokinds,Still have no word back from Patreon whether my actions have been sufficiant.
565,2021-03-12 20:01:46,Twokinds,You can see all the mirrored stuff here:
566,2021-03-12 20:01:58,Twokinds,https://www.deviantart.com/twokinds/gallery/77584748/patreon-mirror
570,2021-03-12 20:02:49,Twokinds,Yeah it's just made Patrons Only
572,2021-03-12 20:04:17,Twokinds,I just don't like having an axe hanging over my head all the time.

215,2021-03-13 14:59:22,Twokinds,yeah
218,2021-03-13 14:59:30,Twokinds,I'm gunna start in a bit just woke up
220,2021-03-13 14:59:37,Twokinds,Finally got a full nights sleep.
231,2021-03-13 15:00:35,Twokinds,Oh is that why time feels weird?
235,2021-03-13 15:00:52,Twokinds,"Then the stream is at it's normal time, at 4 EST"
705,2021-03-13 16:41:20,Twokinds,Well she's a princess of the human empire
706,2021-03-13 16:41:26,Twokinds,She has her own tailors
723,2021-03-13 16:43:17,Twokinds,The queen would be the queen
728,2021-03-13 16:44:15,Twokinds,And the royal dragon is not actually part of the royal succession
730,2021-03-13 16:44:38,Twokinds,"It's an honorary title, because humans wouldn't accept being ruled over by a non-human."
740,2021-03-13 16:45:19,Twokinds,"They want the dragon as part of the royal family, because dragons are symbols of power, so it helps them."
745,2021-03-13 16:45:31,Twokinds,"But they don't want to give the royal dragon actual power. Cause, again, nonhuman"
759,2021-03-13 16:47:29,Twokinds,There is one island in the world with a dragon ruling over and collecting taxes from the humans. But it's specific to that island.
764,2021-03-13 16:48:04,Twokinds,"I don't remember if that was on the map, or if it was too small a location"
770,2021-03-13 16:48:32,Twokinds,"The humans actually did, after hundred of years, try to rebel against the ruling dragon to stop the tax collection."
776,2021-03-13 16:49:17,Twokinds,It was a tax for protection against other invading humans.
778,2021-03-13 16:49:25,Twokinds,"The dragon left and the island began to sink into the ocean, because the dragon made the island with magic, and without him, it couldn't stay up."
786,2021-03-13 16:50:06,Twokinds,"No, they had to quest again, now to get the dragon back."
792,2021-03-13 16:50:53,Twokinds,"Well it was originally to kill the dragon who 'cursed' their island in revenge, but the adventurers eventually put things together."
803,2021-03-13 16:51:56,Twokinds,lol
806,2021-03-13 16:52:10,Twokinds,"Probably another dragon could do it, if they could find one willing."
812,2021-03-13 16:52:50,Twokinds,At least 3
818,2021-03-13 16:53:28,Twokinds,I mean 4. Nora Reni Reni's Mom and that island dragon
824,2021-03-13 16:53:53,Twokinds,Oh and Reni's grandfather.
827,2021-03-13 16:54:06,Twokinds,Willow's mom doesn't count as a dragon anymore.
884,2021-03-13 17:01:33,Twokinds,hey Skidd

1144,2021-03-13 17:46:48,Twokinds,Oh they definitely think Reni is very pompous.

1336,2021-03-13 18:11:40,Twokinds,Thank goodness for pocket dimension technology.
1341,2021-03-13 18:12:07,Twokinds,"Although it would be funny if even with pocket dimension pockets, the ones in women's clothing was still smaller."
1345,2021-03-13 18:12:47,Twokinds,We'll see. I guess this'll sort of be a little test to see what Patreon does.
1671,2021-03-13 18:44:07,Twokinds,Done
1693,2021-03-13 18:45:27,Twokinds,Gunna get some food brb

1823,2021-03-13 19:00:30,Twokinds,I dunno

2240,2021-03-13 19:55:18,Twokinds,I've been watching God of War videos recently
2595,2021-03-13 20:49:12,Twokinds,It's not actually paint.
2605,2021-03-13 20:50:06,Twokinds,It's made from the fruit of a plant that grows on the island.
2626,2021-03-13 20:51:30,Twokinds,"It's white, fairly sweet, and slightly psychoactive in large quantities."
2646,2021-03-13 20:52:39,Twokinds,I mean it's treated about as seriously as coffee.
2703,2021-03-13 21:00:12,Twokinds,Done
2758,2021-03-13 21:06:25,Twokinds,brb
2832,2021-03-13 21:21:49,Twokinds,It's already done
2995,2021-03-13 21:52:48,Twokinds,Yeah this is going to end up patreon only just for dragon butt prob
3072,2021-03-13 22:01:32,Twokinds,Sorry
3073,2021-03-13 22:01:33,Twokinds,Done
3096,2021-03-13 22:04:25,Twokinds,And now I can show the ones I did off stream
3141,2021-03-13 22:07:19,Twokinds,lol
3142,2021-03-13 22:07:34,Twokinds,Tenchi muyo was one of the things I researched while trying to find inspiration
3152,2021-03-13 22:08:10,Twokinds,"Second off screen, also Mike"
3180,2021-03-13 22:10:15,Twokinds,Qutie a lot of Nira
3199,2021-03-13 22:11:47,Twokinds,That Nira always messing with people
3202,2021-03-13 22:12:04,Twokinds,I have one more
3209,2021-03-13 22:12:21,Twokinds,"I actually mentioned it the other day, I drew it a long time ago expecting it to be suggested again"
3210,2021-03-13 22:12:24,Twokinds,It's from bad last Nov
3215,2021-03-13 22:12:37,Twokinds,"But the suggestor changed their suggestion, so I held onto it thinking they'd suggest it again"
3216,2021-03-13 22:12:39,Twokinds,And they never did
3219,2021-03-13 22:12:49,Twokinds,So it just got awkward to keep holding on to it
3252,2021-03-13 22:14:33,Twokinds,"I don't remember, they've changed their suggestion several times since then"
3256,2021-03-13 22:14:48,Twokinds,"I was hoping they'd go back to this one so I could be all impressive. ""Haha! Done, instantly!"""
3258,2021-03-13 22:14:56,Twokinds,But my schemes did not pan out
3270,2021-03-13 22:15:45,Twokinds,Yeah
3271,2021-03-13 22:15:58,Twokinds,I should have figured someone with the name snowmanwizard would want a holiday themed suggestion
3284,2021-03-13 22:16:55,Twokinds,Recap tiem

3465,2021-03-13 22:30:59,Twokinds,I'll work out who's on cooldown.

3469,2021-03-13 22:31:21,Twokinds,You were last week
3478,2021-03-13 22:32:30,Twokinds,Look at all that drawing I did
3500,2021-03-13 22:33:05,Twokinds,Isn't that just... drawing normally?
3503,2021-03-13 22:33:06,Twokinds,XD
3509,2021-03-13 22:33:21,Twokinds,Yeah!

3535,2021-03-13 22:33:52,Twokinds,Thanks for joining the stream!
3541,2021-03-13 22:34:00,Twokinds,Sorry this week was a little off due to the Patreon crap
3544,2021-03-13 22:34:05,Twokinds,Hopefully it doesn't disrupt anything
3557,2021-03-13 22:34:36,Twokinds,"I'm still paranoid their going to temp close the Patreon anyway, just to be spiteful even after Patron Only-ing so many things. lol"
3559,2021-03-13 22:34:38,Twokinds,Hope not.
3588,2021-03-13 22:36:26,Twokinds,It's all hosted on my DA
3589,2021-03-13 22:36:30,Twokinds,For anyone not a Patron.
3597,2021-03-13 22:37:18,Twokinds,Honestly I like DA's image handling way better than all this constant-scrolling stuff every website is going for these days.
3599,2021-03-13 22:37:35,Twokinds,"I just want a nice grid of images,. Easy viewing."
3622,2021-03-13 22:38:55,Twokinds,"I don't have a huge issue with it, though I do hate how they kneecapped the search function for the rest of dA by removing catagories."
3623,2021-03-13 22:39:07,Twokinds,"Makes it impossible to find, for example, resources and textures."
3624,2021-03-13 22:39:15,Twokinds,Which I used to do a lot.
3633,2021-03-13 22:40:16,Twokinds,tk gallery is super useful!
3637,2021-03-13 22:40:37,Twokinds,It was actually invaluable for quickly finding all the stuff I needed to move off of Patreon
3639,2021-03-13 22:40:42,Twokinds,Patreon itself is soooo slow
3646,2021-03-13 22:41:08,Twokinds,And Patreon's constant scrolling just hangs the website after like 3 scrolls down
3648,2021-03-13 22:41:18,Twokinds,It's completely broken
3649,2021-03-13 22:41:22,Twokinds,Why not just use pages like before
3651,2021-03-13 22:41:24,Twokinds,Makes no sense
3652,2021-03-13 22:41:33,Twokinds,Nothing has been removed
3748,2021-03-13 22:52:34,Twokinds,"Well, I don't have any technical know how."
3750,2021-03-13 22:52:55,Twokinds,No the ability to handle that kind of infastructure or bill handling.
3751,2021-03-13 22:52:59,Twokinds,You gotta go through someone.
3753,2021-03-13 22:53:44,Twokinds,"Yeah, people still like to use it. So for now, I'm gunna stick it out with them."
3754,2021-03-13 22:54:02,Twokinds,Someday a competitor might come along and I'll consider it.
3810,2021-03-13 23:04:48,Twokinds,Is it? I feel like it came out and then I heard nothing about it.
3825,2021-03-13 23:07:47,Twokinds,huh?
3831,2021-03-13 23:08:51,Twokinds,Rules are: Don't be a idiot.
3841,2021-03-13 23:09:42,Twokinds,Yes don't bring up porn sites. That should be obvious.
3842,2021-03-13 23:10:09,Twokinds,That falls under don't be an idiot.

328,2022-01-03 01:59:01,Twokinds,The Templar are legitimately concerned things are getting a little out of hand from what Trace started.
329,2022-01-03 01:59:12,Twokinds,That's why they want to ensure that the Tigers stay out of the war.
343,2022-01-03 02:03:08,Twokinds,Reminds me of the kobold kanun
346,2022-01-03 02:04:24,Twokinds,The video on the kobold kanun is great
347,2022-01-03 02:04:32,Twokinds,I can't look it up right now though
355,2022-01-03 02:11:57,Twokinds,I don't remember where I came across it. But it does sound like a fun encounter.

621,2022-01-06 23:40:07,Twokinds,The new version of the armor doesn't even show off the midriff anymore. Poor w0lf.
637,2022-01-06 23:41:02,Twokinds,Always thought it was funny how the old version just had an opening to show off the abs.
640,2022-01-06 23:41:11,Twokinds,Guess to give the demons a fighting chance.
644,2022-01-06 23:41:43,Twokinds,Yeah still got the arms

2343,2022-01-08 20:17:35,Twokinds,Also Keith's symbol is often drawn reversed from the standard version.
