29-11-2020T00:00:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"though the saying is more for ‚Äúfat‚Äù, or this nicer ‚ÄúcUrVy‚Äù term, girs"
29-11-2020T00:01:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"tell you what, what I see of this curvy nonsense is all these girls that look like me from the ribcage down"
29-11-2020T00:01:23,SpazztasticKiwi,their hips match their boobs
29-11-2020T00:01:43,SpazztasticKiwi,"there‚Äôs some of us that aren‚Äôt like that, so what do call us"
29-11-2020T00:03:11,SpazztasticKiwi,"corsets keep you at the perfect angle, that‚Äôs the answer and no it‚Äôs not good for you - never I did the core muscles"
29-11-2020T00:03:21,SpazztasticKiwi,nevermind
29-11-2020T00:05:04,Ordithus,"try to be healthy, and don't break yourself trying to be attractive to strangers"
29-11-2020T00:06:49,Dadrobit,"Like, I get the ""appeal"" of wanting a certain figure. But I don't get trying artificial attempts to get it?"
29-11-2020T00:07:39,Ordithus,vanity is a powerful thing
29-11-2020T00:09:03,Dadrobit,I get vanity. I'm super self-conscious of my figure. But outside forces to sculpt the body is such a weird way to go about it.
29-11-2020T00:09:39,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-natsducky:
29-11-2020T00:10:59,Dadrobit,Getting sick earlier had super-sucked for my piece of mind in that way too. I still get coughing fits and wheeze like a motherfucker if I try to work out too hard. I am substantially less in shape that I used to be and it feels pretty bad.

29-11-2020T00:25:26,Dadrobit,S'pecially if it's to impress a dude.
29-11-2020T00:25:41,Dadrobit,Majority of dudes do not give a fuck.
29-11-2020T00:25:51,SpazztasticKiwi,because you can be shunned if you don‚Äôt

29-11-2020T01:08:07,Ordithus,worth
29-11-2020T01:11:39,SpazztasticKiwi,the trick lies in trying to tell who‚Äôs acting to get their goal and who‚Äôs interested in getting to know you till the end regardless
29-11-2020T01:12:19,SpazztasticKiwi,you can fall for it a few times before you get smart about it
29-11-2020T01:14:31,SpazztasticKiwi,look out for ones that‚Äôll start agreeing with you about things if you‚Äôre friends and given any indication what you‚Äôre looking for isn‚Äôt in them
29-11-2020T01:15:33,SpazztasticKiwi,but anyhoo thanksgiving food is out & so is the void with eyes
29-11-2020T01:16:22,Ordithus,"stare into the void, it stares back"

29-11-2020T11:07:32,SpazztasticKiwi,I had more tea today
29-11-2020T11:07:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I have work in around an hour
29-11-2020T11:07:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm already suddenly nauseous
29-11-2020T11:25:51,CrRAR,"Uhh, you might want to quit the tea then"
29-11-2020T11:26:05,CrRAR,was it the same tea as last time?
29-11-2020T11:27:31,SpazztasticKiwi,yep
29-11-2020T11:27:47,SpazztasticKiwi,diluted this time from what it tastes like
29-11-2020T11:28:14,SpazztasticKiwi,google says it‚Äôs tannin
29-11-2020T11:29:22,SpazztasticKiwi,& starches might help because this happens if you drink tea with nothing else
29-11-2020T11:29:31,SpazztasticKiwi,so I‚Äôm having some danishes
29-11-2020T11:33:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"the nausea is hard waves & it‚Äôll go away - Monday, it was persistent up until I got sick"
29-11-2020T11:37:25,CrRAR,Yeah tannins are that weird waxy taste some grapes have
29-11-2020T11:37:49,CrRAR,Tea can be avoided by not letting it steep very long
29-11-2020T11:38:02,CrRAR,The longer the steeping the more ya get basically
29-11-2020T11:41:07,SpazztasticKiwi,well it‚Äôll either fix it or break it
29-11-2020T11:41:20,SpazztasticKiwi,I still got a hour before work
29-11-2020T11:43:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I no longer feel absolutely rotten at least

29-11-2020T17:44:15,CrRAR,"Yeah, buttery crossiant I feel isn't ideal for chicken salad."
29-11-2020T17:44:19,SpazztasticKiwi,thanks for that imagery when I‚Äôm trying to eat
29-11-2020T17:44:32,CrRAR,Maybe something like molasses bread is though!
29-11-2020T17:44:33,Roughlandin,"Hey, what else are Roughs for"
29-11-2020T17:44:35,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs not a butter crossiant
29-11-2020T17:44:59,SpazztasticKiwi,or it doesn‚Äôt taste like it eventhough that‚Äôs what the package claims
29-11-2020T17:45:19,CrRAR,ah
29-11-2020T17:45:20,SpazztasticKiwi,honestly there might be too much chicken salad on it for me to tell
29-11-2020T17:45:26,Roughlandin,Mildly buttery. Flaky and crispy is what I look for in a good sandwich croissant
29-11-2020T17:45:35,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs definitely flaky
29-11-2020T17:45:43,Roughlandin,"And with enough mayo, chicken salad can mask the taste of anything"
29-11-2020T17:45:48,SpazztasticKiwi,positively falling to pieces
29-11-2020T17:46:05,CrRAR,haha
29-11-2020T17:46:08,SpazztasticKiwi,but it‚Äôs good
29-11-2020T17:46:15,SpazztasticKiwi,which for $4 it better be
29-11-2020T17:46:21,CrRAR,"flaky, both literally and figuratively"
29-11-2020T17:46:50,Roughlandin,So flaky it keeps cancelling on your weekend plans
29-11-2020T17:47:02,CrRAR,:'<
29-11-2020T17:47:21,CrRAR,wind be kicking up here
29-11-2020T17:47:31,SpazztasticKiwi,"the mayo taste tastes slightly off though, like a mayo mimic or something extra is in the salad"
29-11-2020T17:47:42,Roughlandin,Probably miracle whip
29-11-2020T17:47:47,CrRAR,^
29-11-2020T17:47:49,Roughlandin,Or the generic equivalent
29-11-2020T17:47:58,SpazztasticKiwi,"nah, I know miracle whip"
29-11-2020T17:48:14,CrRAR,hmmm
29-11-2020T17:48:17,Roughlandin,It's a distinct flavor
29-11-2020T17:48:26,SpazztasticKiwi,good chucks of chicken tho - breast meat
29-11-2020T17:48:33,Roughlandin,Maybe just cheap vegetable oil based mayo then
29-11-2020T17:48:58,CrRAR,hellman's mayo has a distinct taste
29-11-2020T17:49:11,CrRAR,"mayos do vary, yeah"
29-11-2020T17:49:42,SpazztasticKiwi,"it‚Äôs really good though, and big as my hand so I say with as hungry as I was it worth ‚úÖ"
29-11-2020T17:50:03,CrRAR,lunchbreak accomplished
29-11-2020T17:50:03,Roughlandin,Kiwi approved
29-11-2020T17:50:07,SpazztasticKiwi,hellmans was my dads mayo - I know hellmans taste
29-11-2020T17:50:15,CrRAR,ah

29-11-2020T17:58:20,SpazztasticKiwi,my grandma was saying she needs a new set of spices
29-11-2020T17:58:39,SpazztasticKiwi,and that reminds me she said her dog died last night

29-11-2020T20:50:20,Dadrobit,"Nah, not gift cards, just give em cash and call it a day."
29-11-2020T20:51:18,Dadrobit,"Gift cards are like, ""I don't know what you like, so I'm going to give you money that only works at a place you might or might not like."""
29-11-2020T20:51:26,Dadrobit,Doesn't make sense to me.
29-11-2020T21:02:26,Roughlandin,"Eh. I'm getting my sister a Macy's gift card because she wants a new jacket, and this way I don't have to worry about getting her the wrong size or something"
29-11-2020T21:02:49,Roughlandin,Everybody else I have actual gift gifts for
29-11-2020T21:05:31,Ordithus,already shopped? dang
29-11-2020T21:08:21,Dadrobit,I dunno how many folks I'm even getting anything for. My parents have their gifts. Maybe one brother who still lives right by me. Maybe a few nieces/nephews?
29-11-2020T21:09:58,Dadrobit,I need to figure out if my nephews even ever played with the MTG set I got them last year.
29-11-2020T21:10:41,Dadrobit,"They were starting to get into Pokemon TGC, and they seemed pretty excited when they got the MTG set. But I have no clue where they got with that."
29-11-2020T21:15:33,Roughlandin,"Might as well lol. My nephew and niece have a December 1st birthday, so I grab their birthday and Christmas gifts at the same time. Figured I'd get everybody else while I was at it"
29-11-2020T21:17:42,Ordithus,I barely make it in time before the worlds worst burglar makes his rounds
29-11-2020T21:21:38,Roughlandin,"Lol. It helps that I don't have to bother with actually going out to buy stuff anymore. The internet has made shopping so much easier. Shame for the malls, though"
29-11-2020T21:21:56,Roughlandin,I think this year might be the final nail in the coffin for the American shopping mall
29-11-2020T21:24:52,Dadrobit,Maybe in minor cities and towns. But major cities and some of the larger capitals will still have theirs stick around.
29-11-2020T21:26:15,Roughlandin,Oh we've still got a couple in Louisville. It's about half of what it used to be though. And the ones here on the Indiana side of the river have all disappeared
29-11-2020T21:26:28,Roughlandin,"Well, one is a Bass Pro now"
29-11-2020T21:29:23,AspiringNoodle,"Honestly, it was going to happen sooner or later"
29-11-2020T21:29:48,AspiringNoodle,Too many malls were built because they were tax havens for the people who owned / built them.  More or less a way to keep more money out of the government's hands
29-11-2020T21:30:48,AspiringNoodle,Retail as a whole is in tough shape just because online shopping means people don't need to put up with aggressive sales tactics BS.  And they have more options :P
29-11-2020T21:32:09,Roughlandin,2020 probably hasn't helped to maintain foot traffic either
29-11-2020T21:33:17,Dadrobit,"""And they have more options"" So long as the USPS can stay afloat."

29-11-2020T22:46:33,SpazztasticKiwi,she hates strangers
29-11-2020T22:47:15,Roughlandin,"Sounds like my Stormie. Any time the kids come over, she vanishes"
29-11-2020T22:47:39,SpazztasticKiwi,and loathes men with every fiber of her being and every single fur strand on her body
29-11-2020T22:48:32,Roughlandin,My grandma had a cat that hated men. Probably because my uncle was an asshat
29-11-2020T22:49:15,CrRAR,that‚Äôd do it
29-11-2020T22:49:38,CrRAR,"prank the cat, that‚Äôs that"

29-11-2020T22:50:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Kiwi never liked my ex...for an entire 5 years

29-11-2020T22:50:57,SpazztasticKiwi,"but yet when he contacted me here recently (after 5 years of nothing), he told me he‚Äôs got one"
29-11-2020T22:51:30,CrRAR,Cats have calming powers
29-11-2020T22:51:36,Roughlandin,That's the thing. You don't need to like cats to have a cat. The cat doesn't care!
29-11-2020T22:52:19,Roughlandin,"That's why I like my cat. It's like having a roommate. I feed her and hang out with her from time to time, and otherwise we kinda do our own thing"
29-11-2020T22:52:35,Ordithus,cat moves in. you can't stop it
29-11-2020T22:53:01,Roughlandin,I have never bought a cat. I've had like 4 but I've never bought one
29-11-2020T22:53:15,Ordithus,spooked a rabbit this afternoon

29-11-2020T22:53:59,SpazztasticKiwi,you‚Äôd love this zoltan kaszas comedian on why he likes cats more than dogs
29-11-2020T22:54:31,Roughlandin,I can probably guess why lol
29-11-2020T22:54:38,CrRAR,"I think I saw that one, also wow that guys name"
29-11-2020T22:55:29,CrRAR,Is that the the jeans and sandals guy?
29-11-2020T22:56:11,Roughlandin,"I like dogs, but they're too much energy for me. They're like a co-dependant SO. They constantly need attention and affirmation or they go nuts and destroy all your stuff"

29-11-2020T22:57:22,Roughlandin,I like other people's dogs! Exactly!
29-11-2020T22:57:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm not a fan of dogs because of the energy and more than enough ‚Äúhe don‚Äôt bite‚Äù lies told to me
29-11-2020T22:57:39,SpazztasticKiwi,yes he do bite
29-11-2020T22:58:06,SpazztasticKiwi,and the noise
29-11-2020T22:58:38,Roughlandin,See I'm actually really good with dogs. That's the problem really. They love me and WON'T LEAVE ME ALONE
29-11-2020T22:58:51,SpazztasticKiwi,kids I just don‚Äôt like
29-11-2020T22:59:11,SpazztasticKiwi,sorta for the same reasons but I‚Äôve yet to have one bite me like a dog
29-11-2020T22:59:22,SpazztasticKiwi,if one does there‚Äôs gonna be a big problem
29-11-2020T22:59:57,Roughlandin,I love my niece and nephews... in small doses
29-11-2020T23:00:02,SpazztasticKiwi,but both still like me - I swear kids gravitate towards me more ~because~ I don‚Äôt like them
29-11-2020T23:00:03,Ordithus,only been bit by a kid
29-11-2020T23:00:06,Ordithus,never a cat or dog

29-11-2020T23:00:48,SpazztasticKiwi,had an unknown child run up to me and hug me once unprompted at church
29-11-2020T23:01:00,SpazztasticKiwi,never seen this child in my life
29-11-2020T23:01:15,Roughlandin,Throw holy water on it

29-11-2020T23:05:16,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm not a babysitter...or a dog sitter at this point
29-11-2020T23:05:29,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve lived with dogs that bark constantly for too long
29-11-2020T23:05:59,Roughlandin,I always get stuck dogsitting my best friends' rescue border collie. He's special needs and I'm one of the only people he likes
29-11-2020T23:06:31,CrRAR,"Aww, border collies are pretty chill dogs"
29-11-2020T23:06:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"sometimes I think a kid is an entertainable idea, provided I adopt because me no into the pregnancy thing.....or labor"

29-11-2020T23:08:03,Roughlandin,I once had the option to sit in on a live birth during my hospital internship... I chose to audit an open heart surgery instead
29-11-2020T23:08:07,SpazztasticKiwi,but then a kid shrieks at work and I have to slap that little part of me in my head
29-11-2020T23:08:38,CrRAR,yep
29-11-2020T23:08:44,Roughlandin,The open heart surgery actually wasn't that bad.

29-11-2020T23:12:00,Roughlandin,They should have just had Tom and Mark's mom come explain everything
29-11-2020T23:12:10,CrRAR,The fairy tales ended that day for so many
29-11-2020T23:12:13,CrRAR,;_;
29-11-2020T23:12:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Jesus that video almost killed me
29-11-2020T23:12:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Mark would be dead if he gave birth
29-11-2020T23:12:38,SpazztasticKiwi,he never breathed for his contractions
29-11-2020T23:12:54,Roughlandin,I think he almost passed out
29-11-2020T23:13:52,SpazztasticKiwi,with how much he was holding his breath? p r o b a b l y

29-11-2020T23:16:15,Roughlandin,I'm watching a compilation and Momma Fischbach just asked Mark to imagine sticking a knife into his butthole
29-11-2020T23:16:32,Roughlandin,She has such a way with words
29-11-2020T23:16:32,CrRAR,Choice moment
29-11-2020T23:16:36,SpazztasticKiwi,"that‚Äôs for 5-7 days, not a possible ~24 hours max of contractions (the longest labor I would guess lasted a day and some change but could be more, but after awhile they do a emergency c section)"
29-11-2020T23:17:10,SpazztasticKiwi,a good way to describe childbirth is putting a ping pong ball in a balloon
29-11-2020T23:17:26,SpazztasticKiwi,inflate it just a bit and have the ball fall so it stops the air
29-11-2020T23:17:43,SpazztasticKiwi,that‚Äôs the baby in the birth canal after it‚Äôs moved down
29-11-2020T23:17:54,Roughlandin,Momiplier just said to imagine passing a watermelon through your peehole
29-11-2020T23:18:10,SpazztasticKiwi,"squeeze with one hand, and that‚Äôs the beginning/Braxton Hicks contractions"
29-11-2020T23:18:52,SpazztasticKiwi,and the opening of the balloon will be stretching just like the cervix does as it dilated and the baby is born
29-11-2020T23:19:03,CrRAR,"You know, bodies‚Äô special abilities should be fun to use"
29-11-2020T23:19:13,CrRAR,not... any of this

29-11-2020T23:22:34,SpazztasticKiwi,make sure nothing tore or pulled
29-11-2020T23:23:04,SpazztasticKiwi,and they have to make sure you‚Äôre ok to go to the bathroom & shower

29-11-2020T23:26:18,AspiringNoodle,"Biologically, it stems from times long past where children commonly died shortly after being born"
29-11-2020T23:26:43,AspiringNoodle,No incentive to become attached to something that was likely to die
29-11-2020T23:27:01,AspiringNoodle,"I can't remember exactly when we become attached, but I do believe it's 6 - 9 months or later."
29-11-2020T23:27:06,Roughlandin,There's also the fact that it's hard to love something that won't let you get 3 staight hours of sleep
