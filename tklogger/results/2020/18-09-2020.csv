18-09-2020T00:00:56,ZRO4825,Keanu's one of the few actors I actually recognize on sight. That's saying something. :joy:
18-09-2020T00:01:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I recognize plenty of actors
18-09-2020T00:01:56,SpazztasticKiwi,the concept of me caring if I saw them in person is another story
18-09-2020T00:04:06,SageSaga,oh Zoie
18-09-2020T00:04:17,SageSaga,remember the original drawing  of Mihari i did?
18-09-2020T00:04:20,SpazztasticKiwi,boogyman has won out against aliens

18-09-2020T00:06:05,SageSaga,Mihari asked me to try redrawing it
18-09-2020T00:06:22,Dadrobit,"Gonna head out for a bit myself, got some paperwork to do for the weekend."
18-09-2020T00:06:25,RimaDraws,AWWWW <3

18-09-2020T00:08:21,RimaDraws,later dadro
18-09-2020T00:08:23,SageSaga,swapped her old laptop for a switch and the yosh comic for AI XD

18-09-2020T00:08:52,SpazztasticKiwi,headphones for a lil touch?
18-09-2020T00:08:59,ZRO4825,"I'mma point out, Sage. You got one thing right that almost every furry artist screws up."
18-09-2020T00:09:05,ZRO4825,The proportions of the Switch. :joy:
18-09-2020T00:10:42,ZoieFalcona,the bed sheets went from blue to purple too
18-09-2020T00:11:02,SageSaga,XD
18-09-2020T00:11:22,SageSaga,bed sheets change- if they dont you may need to buy new ones
18-09-2020T00:11:35,ZRO4825,lol
18-09-2020T00:11:44,ZRO4825,"Hey, some people stick with the same color ones all the time! :P"
18-09-2020T00:11:45,ZoieFalcona,"I knooooow, besides, gotta clean them up or otherwise they'd stink :P"
18-09-2020T00:12:48,ZoieFalcona,Pulled up my old portable hard drive to find that pic.... all the pics I saved T.T
18-09-2020T00:17:27,SpazztasticKiwi,how long do you give a movie to be good before you drop it
18-09-2020T00:17:50,SageSaga,till its over usually
18-09-2020T00:18:27,Ordithus,five to ten minutes
18-09-2020T00:18:28,SageSaga,its pretty rare that i start watching a movie that i actually stop it and dont watch it unless it was like- false advertising or has something i physically cant watch
18-09-2020T00:18:31,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve given boogyman 3 minutes & it’s worse than the first 2
18-09-2020T00:19:10,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s eaither really draggy or no good so far
18-09-2020T00:22:01,Mihari,Well... I did it Sage. T_T
18-09-2020T00:22:26,ZoieFalcona,Mihari!!
18-09-2020T00:22:47,Mihari,The monitor will be here on Monday.
18-09-2020T00:23:09,Mihari,Altho... I can't use it till the new desk arrives too...
18-09-2020T00:23:15,Mihari,Hello Zoie
18-09-2020T00:23:29,ZRO4825,Heyyo Mihari!  Gettin a new monitor? Whatcha gettin? :o
18-09-2020T00:24:09,Mihari,This is monitor I just bought - https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07L9HCJ2V/
18-09-2020T00:24:35,SageSaga,let me know if its good so i can get one toooooo
18-09-2020T00:24:47,Mihari,I think we both know already if it will be.
18-09-2020T00:24:49,SageSaga,oi- but i also have surgery coming up-
18-09-2020T00:24:59,ZRO4825,"Oh, nice! I don't know if I could deal with an ultrawide like that. I feel like I miss too much as it is just with a normal 1440p,  lol"
18-09-2020T00:25:33,Mihari,I'm actually afraid it won't be enough.
18-09-2020T00:25:41,Mihari,I was tossing around the idea of tri-monitor setup.
18-09-2020T00:26:00,ZRO4825,lol
18-09-2020T00:26:08,Mihari,I think I've already resolved all the concerns I had about just a single ultrawide tho.
18-09-2020T00:26:26,ZRO4825,I don't have the desk space to pull that off. I'm doing good as is to cram what I need on here currently. XD
18-09-2020T00:26:36,AspiringNoodle,"Very Naisu, Mihari"
18-09-2020T00:26:38,ZoieFalcona,*drools looking at the monitor!*
18-09-2020T00:26:39,Mihari,"Well, like I said, I am getting a new desk too XD"
18-09-2020T00:26:41,ZRO4825,"Any time I set my art tablet it up it's a less than ideal position as is, lol"
18-09-2020T00:26:55,ZRO4825,Better be a big desk for that bad boy. :D
18-09-2020T00:27:01,AspiringNoodle,"I'm on board with that ""play your favorite games while also watching video"" thing"
18-09-2020T00:27:02,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-RainezZz: g'night!
18-09-2020T00:27:12,AspiringNoodle,That thing's basically 2 1440p's put together
18-09-2020T00:27:21,AspiringNoodle,Could easily split up the screen and do multiple things
18-09-2020T00:27:26,unsteddyphoenix,o/
18-09-2020T00:27:27,Mihari,Precisely
18-09-2020T00:27:56,Mihari,My video card will finally be utilized.
18-09-2020T00:28:27,Mihari,Well... properly.
18-09-2020T00:28:39,Mihari,I feel like running 1080 on this is a sin T_T
18-09-2020T00:28:40,SageSaga,more than it is currently
18-09-2020T00:30:49,SpazztasticKiwi,ok it’s kinda picking up
18-09-2020T00:33:14,SageSaga,?
18-09-2020T00:33:52,SpazztasticKiwi,movie
18-09-2020T00:34:02,SageSaga,lol you are still watching?
18-09-2020T00:34:51,SpazztasticKiwi,yeah..?
18-09-2020T00:34:56,ZoieFalcona,"watching, yes."
18-09-2020T00:35:14,SageSaga,i wasnt sure if Kiwi was going to still watch that movie
18-09-2020T00:36:04,SageSaga,man i wish clip studios perspective rulers had a version where you just manipulate a plane in 3D space
18-09-2020T00:36:09,SpazztasticKiwi,kiwi was starting to think that movie wasn’t worth watching but decided to give movie a few more minutes of faith
18-09-2020T00:36:11,SageSaga,i know they could do it-
18-09-2020T00:39:07,ZoieFalcona,Yuns got me looking through my old pictures... the memories coming back
18-09-2020T00:39:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"if you don’t like movies that kill dogs, don’t watch boogyman 3"
18-09-2020T00:39:39,SpazztasticKiwi,just a warning
18-09-2020T00:44:20,ZoieFalcona,XD  Just found the first pic of Grey-chan
18-09-2020T00:50:31,SageSaga,where the heck is my stonewall brush XD

18-09-2020T00:53:58,SpazztasticKiwi,did Jackson take it
18-09-2020T00:54:41,SageSaga,found it
18-09-2020T00:55:39,CheddarCat,"Hi, how's the night?"
18-09-2020T00:56:03,SageSaga,a bit slow
18-09-2020T00:56:29,ZoieFalcona,not complaining on a quiet evening
18-09-2020T00:59:31,SageSaga,i'll complain! i gotta start on my comic and i didnt get this finished!
18-09-2020T00:59:43,SageSaga,so im gonna have to finish this later T_T
18-09-2020T01:00:04,SageSaga,but first- a bathroom break
18-09-2020T01:00:04,CheddarCat,oh noo
18-09-2020T01:01:07,CheddarCat,i have no motive for art tonight. debating horizon zero dawn or tales of zestiria
18-09-2020T01:02:14,AspiringNoodle,Zero Dawn sounds good~
18-09-2020T01:02:30,AspiringNoodle,"I'm just having one of those nights where I wish I never played WoW 14 some years ago, haha"
18-09-2020T01:04:38,CheddarCat,how come?
18-09-2020T01:05:13,SpazztasticKiwi,🍪
18-09-2020T01:05:14,AspiringNoodle,You don't want to know my /played
18-09-2020T01:05:25,CheddarCat,lol
18-09-2020T01:05:32,AspiringNoodle,And I don't even have access to how much time I've spent just because of deleted characters
18-09-2020T01:06:04,CheddarCat,eso was that for me for a while
18-09-2020T01:06:44,AspiringNoodle,I'm a classic example of sunk cost fallacy
18-09-2020T01:09:46,eric190,time for me to be off. g'night all
18-09-2020T01:09:50,CheddarCat,you just had me look something up lol never heard that term before.
18-09-2020T01:09:58,SageSaga,take care Eric have a good night
18-09-2020T01:09:59,CheddarCat,night
18-09-2020T01:10:59,SageSaga,im almost always shocked when i use a word or phrase that someone ive known for a long time has never heard before
18-09-2020T01:11:14,AspiringNoodle,inorite???
18-09-2020T01:11:48,SageSaga,man what was that phrase Tom had never heard before-
18-09-2020T01:12:05,SageSaga,"""Ive gotta head down the road"" and he had no clue what i meant"
18-09-2020T01:12:06,CheddarCat,yay learning multiple new things
18-09-2020T01:12:44,SageSaga,"""What does down the road mean?"" ""It means I literally need to get in a car and travel south"""
18-09-2020T01:13:10,SageSaga,"""It can also mean in the future-"""
18-09-2020T01:13:37,AspiringNoodle,"On the bright side, if Blizzard screws up Shadowlands as badly as I'm afraid they are, I'll probably quit WoW forever :D"
18-09-2020T01:13:51,AspiringNoodle,"...because they'll shut down the servers, lmao"
18-09-2020T01:15:20,CheddarCat,i tried getting into wow but i was super lost cause there was soo much. felt really lost in it all
18-09-2020T01:15:44,AspiringNoodle,"Which expansion?  And that's actually one of WoW's big problems they're hoping to fix in Shadowlands, it's super hostile to new players atm"
18-09-2020T01:16:19,CheddarCat,i think i came in when legion hit
18-09-2020T01:16:45,AspiringNoodle,That would do it
18-09-2020T01:18:18,AspiringNoodle,"If I ever had advice to give to my younger self, it would be ""never touch World of Warcraft"""
18-09-2020T01:19:16,AspiringNoodle,I have completionist and fixation tendencies.  I'm one of the ideal kinds of subs for the game because I'm more likely to spend extended periods inside the game and less likely to drop my sub
18-09-2020T01:19:19,ZRO4825,"See, that would be me with FFXI....but then I'd miss some of the greatest times I ever had"
18-09-2020T01:19:28,CheddarCat,for now ive been between gw2 ffxiv and eso. although im trying to take a step back from mmos and try relearning to enjoy single players again
18-09-2020T01:19:36,SpazztasticKiwi,somebody help me out here - there’s a superhero with a helmet crown thing that has what looks like feathers sticking out of if pointing behind them
18-09-2020T01:19:39,SageSaga,"oh another word a friend didnt know ""subsist"""
18-09-2020T01:19:50,SpazztasticKiwi,who am I thinking of because I’m lost here
18-09-2020T01:19:58,AspiringNoodle,"Sage, buy your friends some dictionaries"
18-09-2020T01:20:42,AspiringNoodle,"MMO's are great in a lot of ways.  Perfect vehicle for socialization.  Lots of content to do at your own pace, a million different ways to play"
18-09-2020T01:20:42,SageSaga,to be fair subsist isnt commonly used in modern english
18-09-2020T01:21:06,SageSaga,only when you are talking about like- subsistence farming tXD
18-09-2020T01:21:53,Sclimshady,I use subsist all the time though?
18-09-2020T01:21:59,AspiringNoodle,"But they're also bad in that they're literal crack (at least WoW is), neverending flow of content, so you're never really ""done"" with the game, and that they can be so engaging that you lose track of time"
18-09-2020T01:22:01,ZRO4825,Then you weird. :D
18-09-2020T01:23:37,CheddarCat,yal be teachin me new words and phrases and im jotting them down on my notepad so i can remember them later
18-09-2020T01:23:50,AspiringNoodle,I'm gonna go to bed now.
18-09-2020T01:23:51,CheddarCat,feels like im back in colge
18-09-2020T01:24:02,CheddarCat,Night!

18-09-2020T01:24:17,SageSaga,take care sleep well!
18-09-2020T01:24:23,AspiringNoodle,Need to decide when to hand in my notice and if I'm gonna do 2 weeks or be nice and do 3 :ptv-unimpressed:
18-09-2020T01:25:01,AspiringNoodle,[*angry sleeping noises*]*:ptv-sleepy:
18-09-2020T01:26:29,ZRO4825,"Take care, Noodle~"
18-09-2020T01:29:42,SpazztasticKiwi,I think thor is whose helmet it reminded me of
18-09-2020T01:39:02,SageSaga,at some point i need to have Henry hit on Kaylin for Nyna to intervene -
18-09-2020T01:39:21,ZRO4825,lol
18-09-2020T01:40:30,SageSaga,but it will have to be a few chapters away-
18-09-2020T01:41:02,SageSaga,next chapter involves returning to Mike- and the chapter after that is meeting Nyna's mom...
18-09-2020T01:42:56,ZRO4825,And poor Relm will be forgotten for pages and pages D:
18-09-2020T01:44:22,SageSaga,"Nyna's mother - ""Oh and who is this?"" Callum - ""My name is Callum, it's a pleasure to meet you"" ""My what a delicious looking child, I could just eat him up"" ""Uhh-"" ""Oh not that way! You know- sexually!"" ""UHM"" Nyna - ""Mom hes not a halfing- hes a kid"" ""oh"""
18-09-2020T01:45:21,SageSaga,and So Nyna's mother went to monster jail
18-09-2020T01:47:40,ZRO4825,XD
18-09-2020T01:53:51,SageSaga,"Nyna - ""you're not my dad, Callum!"" ""If what your mother said is true i suppose I am actually your grandfather -"" ""WHAT?!"""
18-09-2020T01:54:28,SageSaga,(only degenerates will get that joke)

18-09-2020T02:03:22,ZRO4825,I think it's all tags and stuff. but idk for sure. I'm no twitter expert.

18-09-2020T02:06:16,SageSaga,ok spent too much time looking for this -

18-09-2020T02:19:23,johnnytho,I mean Cali's nice. You should see Yosemite
18-09-2020T02:20:19,SageSaga,"i heard some people saying that the US needs to get rid of California because its just a bunch of liberals ruining the Republic- and im like ""it looks like you are from alabama- we need 18 more alabamas to bring in all the money Cali brings in-"""
18-09-2020T02:20:53,SageSaga,and i think we can all say we rather have another cali than even a single more alabama
18-09-2020T02:21:09,SpazztasticKiwi,am I tired or did that make no sense
18-09-2020T02:21:13,johnnytho,amen

18-09-2020T02:22:01,SpazztasticKiwi,cali only makes more because it’s denser
18-09-2020T02:22:16,SageSaga,. . .
18-09-2020T02:22:26,SpazztasticKiwi,a $500000 house there is also $200000 here
18-09-2020T02:23:04,SpazztasticKiwi,whether it’s location and risk or worse understanding of value who knows
18-09-2020T02:23:33,Hogan,Morninges
18-09-2020T02:23:34,SageSaga,cali brings in the most per person too Kiwi
18-09-2020T02:23:54,SageSaga,per capita* not person
18-09-2020T02:23:59,SpazztasticKiwi,they have higher pay rates than us for the most part too
18-09-2020T02:24:01,DarthRexKing,o/
18-09-2020T02:24:11,SpazztasticKiwi,because of the cost of living
18-09-2020T02:24:24,SageSaga,yeah the point is Cali makes the most money that goes to the US as a whole
18-09-2020T02:24:31,Hogan,Knowing Sage's long streams I chanced stepping in this morning even though its been 6+ hours since notification came.... and was rewarded :-)
18-09-2020T02:28:03,SageSaga,"Cali, New York, and Texas have GDPs equal to many countries- they are responsible for keeping smaller states afloat"
18-09-2020T02:30:51,SpazztasticKiwi,so why not start with the states that make the less first then
18-09-2020T02:31:01,SageSaga,start what with them?
18-09-2020T02:31:03,SpazztasticKiwi,cut them out
18-09-2020T02:31:13,SageSaga,we dont want to cut anyone out
18-09-2020T02:31:30,SageSaga,we want all of america to be america-
18-09-2020T02:31:59,SageSaga,there are other people- such as the republicans that dont know how federal funds work that want blue states gone
18-09-2020T02:32:18,SageSaga,like trump who says if we just ignore the blue states were'd doing great with covid
18-09-2020T02:32:34,SageSaga,ignoring that in that case- it IS about population
18-09-2020T02:34:13,SageSaga,im saying I'd rather have an innovative progressive Alabama than a racist uneducated Alabama
18-09-2020T02:35:29,SageSaga,that make sense?
18-09-2020T02:35:53,SageSaga,Alabama isnt all bad of course
18-09-2020T02:36:35,SpazztasticKiwi,what that started as was cut A because B makes 18x more as a response to C party saying B should be cut
18-09-2020T02:36:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Alabama is torn and twisted like the rest of the country
18-09-2020T02:36:57,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s no different
18-09-2020T02:37:41,SageSaga,ok whats a state you dont like since being from Alabama I assume you have some tie to it you dont get what im saying-
18-09-2020T02:38:37,SageSaga,or are you just trying to defend your state from a fictional idea?
18-09-2020T02:40:04,SageSaga,maybe this will make it clear- the point of what i said is not to say- its a better idea to get rid of alabama - but rather to point out the absurdity of getting rid of a state that does more good for the country than bad
18-09-2020T02:41:08,SageSaga,Alabama gets a lot of crap for being a backward state like Mississippi - but not as much as Florida i think=
18-09-2020T02:42:18,SageSaga,Oh! great example of this-
18-09-2020T02:42:38,SageSaga,when people talk about a state where people marry their cousins- whats the first couple states you think of?
18-09-2020T02:43:18,SpazztasticKiwi,the problem is those that are educated hearing what they want to hear or deciding to outright reason around what they actually hear
18-09-2020T02:44:49,SageSaga,im sorry- im not sure i understood that. To me it sounded like you were saying educated people don't think critically- which is what most educated people are taught-
18-09-2020T02:45:56,SageSaga,Is that what you mean? Or did you mean something else?
18-09-2020T02:45:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t care how smart anyone is if they want to explain away trump without hearing some of what he’s said and done or denying it once exposed to it
18-09-2020T02:46:04,ZRO4825,"If my personal experience is any indication, they learn how to do that well within whatever their chosen field is. But hand'em a credit card slip to sign and they get dumb as rocks. :x"
18-09-2020T02:46:26,ZRO4825,Wait
18-09-2020T02:46:33,ZRO4825,When did Trump come in to this? O_o
18-09-2020T02:46:56,SpazztasticKiwi,the division between states?
18-09-2020T02:47:05,ZRO4825,Maybe I didn't read back far enough and missed something. :thinking:
18-09-2020T02:47:06,SageSaga,it was trumpers talking about getting rid of California so its fair to bring him up
18-09-2020T02:47:11,SpazztasticKiwi,you got people for trump out there that are refusing to hear his errors
18-09-2020T02:47:18,ZRO4825,You get that with any leader.
18-09-2020T02:47:29,ZRO4825,"Ain't claiming it's smart or anything, but it's certainly nothing new."
18-09-2020T02:47:47,SpazztasticKiwi,or explaining them away while being a part of or knowing someone in a group he badmouthed
18-09-2020T02:48:23,SpazztasticKiwi,not to mention being ok with him doing so and claiming to be religious or being ok with him signing bibles like he’s Jesus
18-09-2020T02:48:26,SageSaga,sorry do you think i was being pro trump in any way? Im confused where you are going now XD
18-09-2020T02:49:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m referring to the split in states and the country & why there’s “get rid of them” talk
18-09-2020T02:49:33,SageSaga,yeah i was disputing the get rid of states thing
18-09-2020T02:49:44,SageSaga,so we're on the same page Kiwi
18-09-2020T02:49:44,ZRO4825,"Hasn't the ""get rid of them"" talk been a thing like...through numerous presidents?"
18-09-2020T02:49:46,SpazztasticKiwi,"if you don’t support trump and worship his words, you need to leave the country or be removed"
18-09-2020T02:50:06,SpazztasticKiwi,totally not a sign of dictatorship
18-09-2020T02:50:14,SageSaga,"yeah - ""If you dont like this country you can just leave"""
18-09-2020T02:50:32,SageSaga,"Its like- no- i cant, first off I love this country and i want to make it better-"
18-09-2020T02:50:38,SpazztasticKiwi,other leaders have also had better vocabulary than a kindergartner
18-09-2020T02:50:48,SageSaga,"2 - we cant leave no other countries will let us in right now"" XD"
18-09-2020T02:51:49,Hogan,... I think the only place that can accomondate 55 mil+ immigrating Americans would be Antarctica...
18-09-2020T02:52:24,SpazztasticKiwi,“if you don’t like it here leave”
18-09-2020T02:53:10,SpazztasticKiwi,"it is $2,350 to renounce us citizenship"
18-09-2020T02:53:18,SpazztasticKiwi,the highest in the world
18-09-2020T02:54:20,johnnytho,ok guys its late if it comes it comes
18-09-2020T02:54:23,johnnytho,gn
18-09-2020T02:54:25,SageSaga,"its like that episode of The Office- ""I declare BANKRUPTCY!"" ""you cant just say it - there's a process"""
18-09-2020T02:54:34,SageSaga,take care Johnny!
18-09-2020T02:54:40,johnnytho,thx
18-09-2020T02:54:49,SpazztasticKiwi,and on the matter of the educated
18-09-2020T02:55:46,SpazztasticKiwi,there are people in my FAMILY that believe a baby by rape should be carried to term and born and given a chance  because “it’s not the baby’s fault”
18-09-2020T02:55:52,SageSaga,oof Kiwi are you gonna bring up Trumps Patriotic education thing?
18-09-2020T02:56:37,SpazztasticKiwi,not exactly
18-09-2020T02:57:59,SpazztasticKiwi,what on earth is his patriotic education
18-09-2020T02:58:27,SageSaga,omg
18-09-2020T02:58:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"if it’s anything about not being an American if I don’t like him, I’m very much not"
18-09-2020T02:59:17,SageSaga,do you know what the 1619 project is?
18-09-2020T03:01:54,SpazztasticKiwi,wanting to erase slavery on the grounds that religious freedom was why america was founded does not erase the slavery
18-09-2020T03:03:13,SageSaga,so the 1619 project is mostly uncovering how slavery has affected how the US was formed and its role in it- because its often left out of American history
18-09-2020T03:03:48,SpazztasticKiwi,americas actual origin is erased from history period
18-09-2020T03:03:49,SageSaga,"for example textbooks having very little information on slavery or saying ""people were brought in from Africa to help perform chores"""
18-09-2020T03:04:21,SageSaga,so due to the 1619 project people are trying to fix that and do a bit of a better job at explaining US history
18-09-2020T03:04:38,SageSaga,Trump doesnt like this and thinks its a plot to get children to grow up hating america
18-09-2020T03:05:07,SageSaga,so he made an executive order to start a commission into changing education to be more patriotic- so kids will grow up loving america
18-09-2020T03:05:21,SpazztasticKiwi,america should be hated - it exists because it killed and silenced through killing or threats those that opposed it
18-09-2020T03:06:00,SpazztasticKiwi,or actually had a right to the land and resources america stole
18-09-2020T03:06:41,SageSaga,Kiwi- i dont know if i asked you about this - i asked some people a while back but- what did you learn about the Trail of Tears in Grade school?
18-09-2020T03:07:45,SpazztasticKiwi,it was the forcing of some millions of Indians from their homeland regardless of health or security - during the trek or when they ended up where they were forced - to make room for settlers
18-09-2020T03:08:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"most died from old age, hunger, disease, thirst, exhaustion, you name it"
18-09-2020T03:08:13,SageSaga,did you learn about why it happened?
18-09-2020T03:08:32,SpazztasticKiwi,and that’s not taking into account how soldiers treated them because they were thought as lesser
18-09-2020T03:08:42,SpazztasticKiwi,don’t completely remember why
18-09-2020T03:08:52,SageSaga,this was by far one of the sickest abuses of presidential power i had ever heard of -
18-09-2020T03:08:54,SpazztasticKiwi,other than to make room for settlers
18-09-2020T03:09:19,SageSaga,so the main nation that refused to leave- the Cherokee Indians -took the US to court about the forced moving
18-09-2020T03:09:27,SpazztasticKiwi,"they wanted the land so despite the Indians being there first bad having history there, they were moved out"
18-09-2020T03:09:42,SageSaga,the court case went all the way to the supreme court
18-09-2020T03:09:42,SpazztasticKiwi,and
18-09-2020T03:09:45,SageSaga,and they won
18-09-2020T03:09:53,SageSaga,The Cherokee won
18-09-2020T03:10:22,SageSaga,"Then the president said ""The supreme court has made their decision- now let them enforce it"""
18-09-2020T03:10:25,SpazztasticKiwi,yeah sounds like the oil debate
18-09-2020T03:10:26,SageSaga,and did it anyways
18-09-2020T03:10:53,SageSaga,its the presidents duty to uphold the supreme courts ruling- and he just ignored it
18-09-2020T03:11:11,SpazztasticKiwi,rich white man in power stops at nothing to keep his position and get more
18-09-2020T03:11:18,SpazztasticKiwi,that’s history
18-09-2020T03:11:58,SpazztasticKiwi,be it speaking for God or as God or explaining away outright murder
18-09-2020T03:12:04,SageSaga,"except another group of ""white rich men"" told him he couldnt and that it was wrong even way back then- and he went against the law and did it anyways"
18-09-2020T03:12:29,SpazztasticKiwi,through psychology or whatever gobbledygook he can think of
18-09-2020T03:12:55,SageSaga,so the story is- there were good people back then doing the right thing- but a blowhard with too much power still screwed everyone
18-09-2020T03:13:25,SpazztasticKiwi,the only reason why I know america will be a dictatorship if trump is reelected
18-09-2020T03:13:56,SpazztasticKiwi,"we need someone to backtrack his work, make natzis illegal, supporting it illegal, and so on"
18-09-2020T03:14:11,SageSaga,but how do you convince these people that trump is what he is?
18-09-2020T03:14:38,SpazztasticKiwi,I just show them clips of what he’s said or say it and lay them look it up if they choose
18-09-2020T03:14:42,SageSaga,my parents dont like Trump- but they are still going to vote for him because hes the republican and you cant trust those socialist...
18-09-2020T03:14:55,SpazztasticKiwi,maybe the do or maybe they don’t but I’ve yet to move on my opinions
18-09-2020T03:15:13,SageSaga,"i show them clips and they just go ""he didnt really mean that"" or ""Thats out of context!"""
18-09-2020T03:15:26,SpazztasticKiwi,“be ignorant then”
18-09-2020T03:15:30,SageSaga,and again- they dont even like him but they will twist everything
18-09-2020T03:15:46,SpazztasticKiwi,my mother and family specifically are the same
18-09-2020T03:15:47,SageSaga,all because they think he will end the baby killing
18-09-2020T03:16:15,SpazztasticKiwi,my aunt shared a “I was left out of things when I was young so trust me to include you”
18-09-2020T03:17:06,SpazztasticKiwi,she and the others in my family threw a fit rivaling a presidential tantrum when I refused to talk to them after they made plans to go shopping FOR THE SECOND TIME without including me in the plans
18-09-2020T03:17:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"they just decided to go, knowing I worked that day, never asked about my schedule"
18-09-2020T03:17:43,SpazztasticKiwi,and I was set to be off the next day yet they didn’t reschedule
18-09-2020T03:18:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I get kicked out of fucking family outings rather regularly too
18-09-2020T03:18:59,SageSaga,because you are a commie socialist?
18-09-2020T03:19:19,SpazztasticKiwi,"when black panther came out, I said to my mom and sister that I’d like to go so we made plans to go that Tuesday for discount ticket night at 12 pmish"
18-09-2020T03:19:44,SpazztasticKiwi,but they decided that night to instead wake up earlier and go to the earlier showing
18-09-2020T03:19:57,SpazztasticKiwi,didn’t even try to wake me and ask
18-09-2020T03:20:04,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t give a damn why
18-09-2020T03:20:26,SpazztasticKiwi,my point is they have nerve to be mad I’m mad when all I want was to be included
18-09-2020T03:20:29,SageSaga,i certainly would- the commie socialist thing was a joke though i hope you know
18-09-2020T03:21:21,SpazztasticKiwi,which is why I’m even more furious lann deleted that fucking server
18-09-2020T03:21:52,SpazztasticKiwi,oh and might I add they left me for a marvel movie showing THREE DIFFERENT TIMES
18-09-2020T03:21:55,SageSaga,but id very much like to know why all that happened- people even stupid people (no offense) do things for a reason- either they just dont think about others as much or they truly think something about you like you dont like them-
18-09-2020T03:22:20,SageSaga,there's gotta be a reason even if the reason is stupid
18-09-2020T03:22:27,SpazztasticKiwi,“oh but you don’t have as much interest in the marvel movies as your sister” legit what my moms response was
18-09-2020T03:22:37,SpazztasticKiwi,don’t have favorites my ass
18-09-2020T03:23:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t drool over them or invest my life in the lore but I still like them
18-09-2020T03:23:13,SpazztasticKiwi,I still would’ve liked to got
18-09-2020T03:23:16,SpazztasticKiwi,go
18-09-2020T03:23:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I honestly can’t be bothered to figure out why
18-09-2020T03:23:57,SageSaga,"the other day- get this - my mother was complaining about how horrible my sister was being and she said ""Well- you know how she can be!"" and i was like ""Yeah- I know very well because you never stopped her when she did it as a kid"""
18-09-2020T03:23:58,SpazztasticKiwi,maybe they believe I won’t mind even after all that or they don’t like I don’t agree with them
18-09-2020T03:24:12,ZRO4825,oof
18-09-2020T03:24:22,SpazztasticKiwi,I can’t say I’m bothered to care at this point
18-09-2020T03:24:54,SpazztasticKiwi,"if they treat me like this now, what happened if I really do show my true colors"
18-09-2020T03:25:30,SpazztasticKiwi,anti abortion anti lgbt hypocrites
18-09-2020T03:26:36,SpazztasticKiwi,mother didn’t like Mark and Seán and all them in the beginning at all - they swear too much & are too vulgar and crass
18-09-2020T03:26:46,SpazztasticKiwi,yet you’ll watch the walking dead
18-09-2020T03:27:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t know if she’s warmed up to them or has begrudgingly gotten it across that I’m an adult she can’t control anymore but she hasn’t said anything for years
18-09-2020T03:28:03,SpazztasticKiwi,but it’s pitiful  I’m more at home in their communities than at home
18-09-2020T03:28:19,SageSaga,what im looking for in life when it comes to dealing with these people is this- Im looking for a way to break through to them
18-09-2020T03:28:34,SageSaga,i dont know if a way exists- but i want one
18-09-2020T03:29:12,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d say a bullet gets through things pretty easy but that might be too far
18-09-2020T03:30:01,SageSaga,"my mother said ""I hate talking to you about anything political!"" and i said ""Well I just hope that I can get you to understand some of these things"" and she said ""you dont understand any of it!"" and i said ""If you can prove anything to me I will change"
18-09-2020T03:30:21,SageSaga,"my mind- its what i do - if i get new and better information i update my thoughts and opinions"""
18-09-2020T03:31:00,SageSaga,and i ask her if she can do they same and she says no
18-09-2020T03:31:05,SageSaga,so im just- yeeeeeah
18-09-2020T03:31:28,SageSaga,and maaaaan she gets angry if i call her ignorant for that XD
18-09-2020T03:33:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t give a damn if people find or think I’m rude or mean
18-09-2020T03:33:22,SageSaga,"so she tried to give me some political  information and i was like ""Ive heard all of this"" and she said ""And why didnt you change your mind then?"" and i said ""Because it's not true- this information is completely false- all these fact checkers say so"""
18-09-2020T03:33:51,SpazztasticKiwi,at this point it’s because I don’t repeat their own opinions back at them like they want
18-09-2020T03:35:08,SpazztasticKiwi,people that think I’m calm or nice don’t realize I just have a very good control on when I do explode
18-09-2020T03:35:16,SageSaga,im not pro abortion - i dont like it- but my goal isnt to make abortion illegal - i'd like it to be an non issue- i'd like to make it so abortions just arent needed at all
18-09-2020T03:35:58,SpazztasticKiwi,the problem there is some are done because the fetus developing will kill the mother of not removed
18-09-2020T03:36:04,SpazztasticKiwi,if
18-09-2020T03:36:29,SageSaga,those are extremely rare to the point where its practically a non issue
18-09-2020T03:36:39,SpazztasticKiwi,or it will not survive when it is separated from the womb
18-09-2020T03:36:45,SageSaga,besides - again - i dont want to make them illegal
18-09-2020T03:36:55,SageSaga,i want to make them unnessary
18-09-2020T03:37:20,SpazztasticKiwi,my only problem with it is people using it because they didn’t use a condom or think about birth control
18-09-2020T03:37:29,SageSaga,exactly
18-09-2020T03:37:50,SpazztasticKiwi,we’re you expecting a flat screen tv?
18-09-2020T03:37:51,SageSaga,"i want to promote better sex education, protection methods, and of course- no more rape"
18-09-2020T03:38:12,ZRO4825,"That'd be the dream, aye."
18-09-2020T03:38:29,SageSaga,i think doing those things would be better than trying to make it illegal
18-09-2020T03:38:42,SageSaga,because you know what happens when you make abortions illegal?
18-09-2020T03:38:51,SageSaga,People find other ways
18-09-2020T03:39:04,ZRO4825,Say hell to Prohibition #2412345
18-09-2020T03:39:05,SageSaga,and without a medical professional - more people die than just babies
18-09-2020T03:39:07,ZRO4825,hello*
18-09-2020T03:39:52,SageSaga,this was one of the whole reasons it was made legal- people were doing their own abortions and dying or of course- doing it wrong
18-09-2020T03:39:58,SpazztasticKiwi,things were better when rapists and pedophiles were rounded up and sacrificed to the goddess of beauty
18-09-2020T03:40:12,JeremySenpai,O.o sage still going
18-09-2020T03:40:26,SageSaga,naturally
18-09-2020T03:40:44,SageSaga,and discussing heavy topics XD
18-09-2020T03:40:53,SpazztasticKiwi,or when they just cut the guys shit off in the middle of the public square
18-09-2020T03:41:55,SageSaga,so basically if someones going to point a gun at my head and tell me i have to pick Prochoice or Prolife- im prochoice because it has the better outcomes- but i prefer no deaths at all
18-09-2020T03:46:36,SageSaga,oh - thinking about abortion topics- there was an argument where if you were talking to a christian that believes animals have souls- you can say abortions are natural and ok- because there are many animals capable of natural self abortion
18-09-2020T03:47:01,SageSaga,horses are capable of this- they do it to protect themselves and their unborn children
18-09-2020T03:47:12,SpazztasticKiwi,animals don’t have free will
18-09-2020T03:47:32,SageSaga,debatable anything does
18-09-2020T03:47:44,SpazztasticKiwi,free will is what separates humans as the ruling race of the planet
18-09-2020T03:48:10,SpazztasticKiwi,yet put a hiker on a trail and let him do much as get lost and nature whoops his ass
18-09-2020T03:48:15,SageSaga,we dont have any proof of that and we can generally tell what people will do given circumstances
18-09-2020T03:48:19,SageSaga,its jsut more complex
18-09-2020T03:49:13,SpazztasticKiwi,the ability to tell right from wrong is what separates the human race as the superior body and is supposed to be our claim as rulers of the earth
18-09-2020T03:49:53,SageSaga,yet people choose to do the wrong thing all the time- due to circumstances - so did they ever really have a choice at all?
18-09-2020T03:50:02,SpazztasticKiwi,"after the fall, communication with the animals and nature ended and man had to work for themselves rather than live in harmony and have everything provided"
18-09-2020T03:50:58,SpazztasticKiwi,the choice to do wrong or right is usually determined by following the rules that were given in the beginning like thou shalt not kill
18-09-2020T03:51:20,SpazztasticKiwi,but because of sin and yadayadayada do we really want me to explain this
18-09-2020T03:51:56,SpazztasticKiwi,the fall of man is why we can’t have nice things is the short of it
18-09-2020T03:52:21,SageSaga,i like the idea that we have free will but i can also see that if you break down the complexities almost everything we do is just a more puzzling web of obvious decisions any animal would make
18-09-2020T03:53:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"we have religion which is supposed to guide us in a good life, theoretically a perfect life but one bad apple ruins that for everyone thus we have the world we have today"
18-09-2020T03:53:43,SpazztasticKiwi,animals don’t have religion
18-09-2020T03:54:14,SageSaga,and there are people who say animals dont need religion because they already know God
18-09-2020T03:54:50,SpazztasticKiwi,I mean maybe but you show me a cow doing a Hail Mary
18-09-2020T03:55:03,SpazztasticKiwi,or a hamster in the confessional booth
18-09-2020T03:55:05,SageSaga,it doesnt need to - it knows God- it has no need to do so
18-09-2020T03:55:22,SageSaga,whatever it does it does as it is meant to by God
18-09-2020T03:55:43,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d say humans must be the same way then
18-09-2020T03:56:00,SageSaga,the same might be said of humans- maybe all humans in some way- already know God- maybe they dont need to worship or study a book of what our ancestors thought of God
18-09-2020T03:56:12,SpazztasticKiwi,God interferes and interacts how he sees fit yet we’re told he withdrew from meddling with the world
18-09-2020T03:56:19,SpazztasticKiwi,so who’s to really know
18-09-2020T03:56:34,Dadrobit,Back for a bit I think. Busy night. Vandalism popping up in some communities. Not good....
18-09-2020T03:56:43,SageSaga,that sucks man
18-09-2020T03:56:46,ZRO4825,"That sucks to hear, Dadro. :c"
18-09-2020T03:56:49,SageSaga,anything interesting?
18-09-2020T03:57:00,SpazztasticKiwi,“joe wuz here”
18-09-2020T03:57:37,SageSaga,"like weird vandalism or like ""ACAB - Also sorry to whoever has to clean this up, we let our emotions get the best of us but we also have work and dont have time to help - so sorry"""
18-09-2020T03:57:45,SpazztasticKiwi,too bad Tom didn’t say night
18-09-2020T03:57:51,Dadrobit,Spray paint on cars. Very fucking expensive ones.
18-09-2020T03:57:57,ZRO4825,>:(
18-09-2020T03:58:11,SpazztasticKiwi,will they buy a new one or get it repainted
18-09-2020T03:58:34,SageSaga,oof- did it say anything or was it art?
18-09-2020T03:58:56,Dadrobit,"No idea, but security is getting a new ass ripped for it."
18-09-2020T03:59:13,Dadrobit,"The spray paint is just random marks, no messages."
18-09-2020T03:59:18,SageSaga,Zro- imagine you go out to your car- and someone has spray painted it- BUT - it looks like a super amazing painting of all your favorite anime girls-
18-09-2020T03:59:50,SpazztasticKiwi,speedpaint or the flash has hobbies
18-09-2020T03:59:51,Dadrobit,Fuckin blows because it's happening on my shift....
18-09-2020T04:00:10,Dadrobit,Has to be at least.
18-09-2020T04:00:13,SageSaga,yeah that really sucks Robit- so they snuck in or - was it an inside job?!
18-09-2020T04:00:41,Dadrobit,"No clue, no real way to know. The area it happened in was an unmanned community."
18-09-2020T04:00:59,SpazztasticKiwi,but it’s secuis fault?
18-09-2020T04:01:15,SageSaga,unmanned?
18-09-2020T04:01:24,Dadrobit,So security patrol is only in there for 20-40 minutes a night at random times with how much ground they have to otherwise cover.
18-09-2020T04:01:36,Dadrobit,The access gate is automated.
18-09-2020T04:01:57,SageSaga,and the entire community is fenced?
18-09-2020T04:02:08,Dadrobit,"No one man's the gate. Cameras capture vehicles entering and leaving, but that's it"
18-09-2020T04:02:14,SageSaga,so you have particular areas you can generally only access it from
18-09-2020T04:02:31,Dadrobit,"Yeah, 8 or 9 foot tall concrete walls."
18-09-2020T04:02:41,SageSaga,no cameras i assume in the non-manned area - but are there on the perimeter?
18-09-2020T04:03:02,Dadrobit,"Nope, just entry cameras and homeowners cameras if they got em."
18-09-2020T04:04:00,SageSaga,i assume they checked if any cameras were on any homes or buildings that may have been in the area? or was it like a parking lot away from any buildings?
18-09-2020T04:04:03,Dadrobit,"And there are foot paths that can be used at the gates that are not secured, so you can just walk in if you want."
18-09-2020T04:04:42,Dadrobit,Cars were in the car ports of the homes.
18-09-2020T04:04:43,SageSaga,man if people want security they sure dont know how to keep a place secure-
18-09-2020T04:05:17,SageSaga,and none of those homes had cameras i guess?
18-09-2020T04:05:18,Dadrobit,"That's the thing. These people, 98% don't want security, they want a concierge with a badge that greets them."
18-09-2020T04:05:37,Dadrobit,"Not that I am aware of, no."
18-09-2020T04:06:06,Dadrobit,Convenience > Security for most of these folks.
18-09-2020T04:06:10,SageSaga,man more rich people need to take their stuff seriously or just get over the fact that their stuff gets ruined sometimes
18-09-2020T04:06:54,SageSaga,if your rich- use your money to protect your stuff- or just buy new stuff
18-09-2020T04:07:22,Dadrobit,"My guess is it was just an asshole kid with a rattle can, not much we can realistically do...."
18-09-2020T04:08:12,Dadrobit,But fuck me does it look bad. Security gets millions of dollars from the HOA every year and we can't stop vandalism? Fuckin A.
18-09-2020T04:08:48,SageSaga,XD y'all need cameras
18-09-2020T04:09:13,ZRO4825,"It's a simple fact. No one wants Big Brother, but everyone wants perfect security. You're not gonna have one without the other, really. :x"
18-09-2020T04:09:26,Dadrobit,I have 30 cameras I gotta watch already...
18-09-2020T04:09:45,SageSaga,Zro - you never answered me!
18-09-2020T04:12:21,ZRO4825,I didn't? o.O
18-09-2020T04:12:35,ZRO4825,"Oh, the paint thing"
18-09-2020T04:12:46,ZRO4825,"Honestly...I'd probably be appreciative of the art, but still pissed. XD"
18-09-2020T04:12:50,Dadrobit,"16 cameras for the unmanned gates I monitor, plus the ones that show that the other guards are up to, plus the ones in and around my community. Doesn't help I only have 2 monitors so everything is tiny..."
18-09-2020T04:13:03,Dadrobit,What the*
18-09-2020T04:13:11,ZRO4825,And those 2 monitors are also probably not exactly huge to begin with
18-09-2020T04:13:12,SageSaga,"*huff!* ""This is really cool but- man i wish they had asked first!"""
18-09-2020T04:13:35,ZRO4825,"Well that and if you're trying to bank on a car's resale value, a custom paintjob shoots that right in the foot. :P"
18-09-2020T04:13:36,Dadrobit,"One is huge, the other is small even for a computer monitor."
18-09-2020T04:14:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Sage you see that anime car I found at work a year ago
18-09-2020T04:14:21,SageSaga,i think so
18-09-2020T04:14:32,SpazztasticKiwi,and then when it was back earlier this year with more
18-09-2020T04:14:32,Dadrobit,Big one is for the guards and my community. Teeny tiny one has 16 shots crammed on it for the unmanned
18-09-2020T04:14:45,SpazztasticKiwi,because the cars got more stuff on it
18-09-2020T04:15:11,SpazztasticKiwi,I have work in 7 hours
18-09-2020T04:15:53,SageSaga,man if we could get cars that were made of screens-
18-09-2020T04:16:20,ZRO4825,We'd have I'm wagering at least 30% higher accident rates due to distracted drivers. :P
18-09-2020T04:16:27,Dadrobit,"Lewd cars, lewd cars everywhere."
18-09-2020T04:16:58,SageSaga,like- no animations allowed- sfw only- but like- custom designs based on the driver
18-09-2020T04:17:20,SageSaga,kinda like you have a design saved to your phone and if you are in the driver seat it displays that options while you drive
18-09-2020T04:17:27,Dadrobit,Major brands would sell custom screens.
18-09-2020T04:17:29,SpazztasticKiwi,not unless everyone can get really cool about alot of things really quick
18-09-2020T04:17:39,SageSaga,XD ty Kiwi
18-09-2020T04:17:41,SageSaga,ty so much
18-09-2020T04:18:16,Dadrobit,So you could pay $X and rep the Diamondbacks or something and maybe get a few free home games.
18-09-2020T04:18:45,Dadrobit,"Fuck, I'd do it."
18-09-2020T04:19:49,Dadrobit,"Also, what's the point if it's not animated? We already have that by just getting a car wrapped."
18-09-2020T04:21:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I can send the pictures next time your online here or somewhere you get messages
18-09-2020T04:21:23,SpazztasticKiwi,you’re
18-09-2020T04:21:44,Dadrobit,?
18-09-2020T04:21:56,SpazztasticKiwi,but it’s really more stickers were added
18-09-2020T04:22:13,SpazztasticKiwi,the anime car I shared on lanns server a year ago
18-09-2020T04:22:35,SpazztasticKiwi,it came back around with more stuff
18-09-2020T04:22:45,SageSaga,my mother would be pissed if i put one of these in her car XD
18-09-2020T04:22:54,Dadrobit,"Ohhh, I have something similar at my college. 99% sure I've shared it here before. Totally covered in anime."
18-09-2020T04:23:05,SageSaga,(i got rid of my car a long time ago and I just use her car now) XD
18-09-2020T04:23:52,Dadrobit,"That reminds me, I really need to invest in a good furry steering wheel cover."
18-09-2020T04:24:01,Dadrobit,Furry as in hair.
18-09-2020T04:24:13,SpazztasticKiwi,*sighs of disappointment*
18-09-2020T04:24:14,ZRO4825,"omg I hate those kind of covers, lol"
18-09-2020T04:24:43,Dadrobit,Shit vote too hot to touch in the summer without waiting 15 minutes for the A/C to co things down enough to touch.
18-09-2020T04:24:57,Dadrobit,Shit vote???? What???
18-09-2020T04:25:10,SageSaga,I - Dont- KNOW
18-09-2020T04:25:34,SpazztasticKiwi,pomegranate
18-09-2020T04:25:39,Dadrobit,Shit is too hot*
18-09-2020T04:25:47,SpazztasticKiwi,hot damn
18-09-2020T04:25:51,SpazztasticKiwi,call the police
18-09-2020T04:26:03,ZRO4825,"Damnit, Kiwi, get outta my head, lol"
18-09-2020T04:26:10,Dadrobit,Cars be dangerous yo.
18-09-2020T04:26:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m walking fun the problem is I’m not around the people I’m fun with
18-09-2020T04:26:54,Dadrobit,Every summer you gotta listen to these absurdly depressing commercials on the radio about babies and toddlers dying in cars from heat.
18-09-2020T04:26:59,Dadrobit,Shit suuuucks
18-09-2020T04:27:23,SpazztasticKiwi,must be a local station
18-09-2020T04:27:42,ZRO4825,I still don't understand how anyone in this day and age doesn't already understand that.
18-09-2020T04:27:43,Dadrobit,"I mean, it's on most all of em."
18-09-2020T04:27:43,SpazztasticKiwi,there’s no announcements on what I listen to
18-09-2020T04:28:40,Dadrobit,And Hubbard Broadcasting is pretty huge. Iheartradio does it too.
18-09-2020T04:28:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I have neither
18-09-2020T04:29:16,SpazztasticKiwi,I change it when there’s a commercial anyway
18-09-2020T04:29:19,SageSaga,if i listen to anything while driving- its what yall are hearing now if you got the stream music on XD
18-09-2020T04:30:13,Dadrobit,"ZRO, the latest one was about getting back into the routine of work and forgetting you also had to stop and drop the kids off at a babysitter. They make sure to have a baby go from laughing to screaming all the while to really well it with just silence."
18-09-2020T04:30:35,Dadrobit,Sell it*
18-09-2020T04:31:12,Dadrobit,"Alas, Sage no Aux in on my radio. Just a CD player."
18-09-2020T04:31:29,SageSaga,cell phone?
18-09-2020T04:31:49,ZRO4825,"I'm guessing no bluetooth either, lol"
18-09-2020T04:31:54,Dadrobit,Like... Just play music on my phone in the passenger seat?????
18-09-2020T04:32:09,SageSaga,yes?
18-09-2020T04:32:14,Dadrobit,"No, no bluetooth either."
18-09-2020T04:32:43,Dadrobit,"No. My phone has okay speakers, but I'm not gonna settle for that on drives."
18-09-2020T04:33:22,SageSaga,get one of those local band wave radio things to attach to your phone!
18-09-2020T04:33:40,Dadrobit,The sound system in my car is actually surprisingly excellent. I am more than happy to just listen to the occasional commercial for it.
18-09-2020T04:33:59,Dadrobit,Or just swap to one of my CDs.
18-09-2020T04:35:31,Dadrobit,"""local band wave radio""?"
18-09-2020T04:37:37,SageSaga,there were these old things we used with old MP3 players- they sent out your mp3 players audio as an AM signal
18-09-2020T04:37:55,SageSaga,so you set your car radio to the AM frequency and listened to your music
18-09-2020T04:38:09,Dadrobit,"Ohhhhh, like a mini pirate radio."
18-09-2020T04:38:16,SageSaga,very mini
18-09-2020T04:38:28,SageSaga,usually didnt work more than 6 feet from the antena
18-09-2020T04:38:40,Dadrobit,Local band-wave not local-band wave.
18-09-2020T04:38:55,Dadrobit,I was confused where local bands came into it.
18-09-2020T04:39:02,SageSaga,XD
18-09-2020T04:39:31,ZRO4825,lol
18-09-2020T04:39:42,SageSaga,you wave to a local band and they get in your car and play music for you
18-09-2020T04:40:37,Dadrobit,"I was gonna say, I already support local talent where I can, dunno how that helps my car's radio though."
18-09-2020T04:41:14,Dadrobit,Actually have an album from a local band in my radio atm.
18-09-2020T04:41:24,Dadrobit,Heartstrings I think is the name.
18-09-2020T04:45:19,SageSaga,so i watched the first 2 seasons of Cobra Kai
18-09-2020T04:45:44,Dadrobit,Wasn't that the Karate Kid spin-off?
18-09-2020T04:45:50,SageSaga,yes
18-09-2020T04:46:12,ZRO4825,"Aight, on that note, I gotta head off. Getting too much yawn build-up. Have a good morning. ^^/"
18-09-2020T04:46:12,SageSaga,it's- really good- like pretty silly at times- but really good
18-09-2020T04:46:18,SageSaga,take care man!
18-09-2020T04:46:24,Dadrobit,o/ ZRO
18-09-2020T04:47:19,SageSaga,if you liked the original movie- or all the original movies- i recommend it
18-09-2020T04:48:10,Dadrobit,"Tbh, the only one I ever saw was with Jackie Chan and Jaiden Smith."
18-09-2020T04:48:25,Dadrobit,"I liked it, it was cute."
18-09-2020T04:48:35,SageSaga,that one was fine but the original is a classic
18-09-2020T04:48:47,SageSaga,if you like 80s films- its a must watch
18-09-2020T04:50:12,Dadrobit,Honestly thatre
18-09-2020T04:50:31,Dadrobit,They're not terribly high on my to-do list of movies
18-09-2020T04:50:53,SageSaga,what ya got?
18-09-2020T04:52:17,Dadrobit,I was actually planning on a binge watch of all of the hobbit and lotr movies over one of the next few weekends. My brother and I haven't seen them in forever and we wanted to refresh it
18-09-2020T04:53:09,Dadrobit,"Lotr came up I  a conversation a week or so back and we realized we really wanted to see it again, so it became a plan-ish."
18-09-2020T04:55:11,SageSaga,well - if you ever want to see the story of a young man take up Karate to defend himself and in the end get a father figure that is flawed and wise and the roller coaster of their adventurers that then leads into a series of his rival turning into a
18-09-2020T04:55:16,SageSaga,decent person - i recommend it
18-09-2020T04:55:54,Dadrobit,"Lol, one day I'll get to it."
18-09-2020T04:56:37,SageSaga,the rival is the main character of Cobra Kai but hes like finally getting out of his 30 year funk of losing XD
18-09-2020T04:57:12,SageSaga,hes totally out of it- he is also very very uncouth- and its pretty great because hes not really a dick about it- but he is dumb
18-09-2020T04:57:52,SageSaga,"so like at first hes like ""No girls, girls cant fight"" and his student is like ""First off- thats wrong to treat her that way- and second- you neeeeeed the money!"""
18-09-2020T04:58:18,Dadrobit,Money. Everybody's got a price.
18-09-2020T04:58:43,SageSaga,"and then later hes on the phone and he says ""Non binary? Oh Gender- yeah we allow boys and girls... huh? Is this a prank call?!"""
18-09-2020T04:59:12,Dadrobit,"""pansexual??? You really into Cuisinart or somethin'???"""
18-09-2020T04:59:59,SageSaga,"""I really like these tiny bananas"" ""Those are plantains"" ""Well here we call them Bananas"""
18-09-2020T05:00:14,Dadrobit,Lol
18-09-2020T05:01:06,SageSaga,the kinda twist is- hes a dick- but hes not really a bad person- so while hes crude- hes actually teaching the kids how to be proud of themselves - while they are teaching him how to be a better person
18-09-2020T05:02:07,Dadrobit,"I feel like I've seen that trope a bunch, but I can't think of any off the top of my head."
18-09-2020T05:02:30,SageSaga,its totally a trope but this is it done very well
18-09-2020T05:02:36,SageSaga,they did it in the Mighty Ducks
18-09-2020T05:02:56,Dadrobit,Hello childhood memories

18-09-2020T14:09:39,Ordithus,yeah?
18-09-2020T14:10:32,SageSaga,i was in this creepy castle and i found a room with only a refrigerator in the middle of the room
18-09-2020T14:11:39,SageSaga,i opened it up and it had these pudding cups with cat faces of chocolate pudding in the vanilla pudding-
18-09-2020T14:12:50,SageSaga,i ate one and i turned into a catgirl - and then all these guys started hitting on me
18-09-2020T14:13:25,Ordithus,people would pay good money for those
18-09-2020T14:13:26,BadFoMo,I was about te ask if the catgirl part happened.
18-09-2020T14:13:28,SageSaga,next thing i know im running from a bunch of guys chasing me
18-09-2020T14:13:31,BadFoMo,*to
18-09-2020T14:14:15,Titanarisium,i-
18-09-2020T14:14:24,Ordithus,"""I'm not into guys! I'm into more catgirls!"""
18-09-2020T14:14:59,SageSaga,"and as i was running one of the doors opened and a maid popped her head out and was like ""Quick! in here!"""
18-09-2020T14:15:03,SageSaga,and so i ran in-
18-09-2020T14:18:09,SageSaga,"she closed the door shut behind me and locked it and i was like ""Wow that was close- thank you-"" and then she hand slammed me against the door and she was like ""Anything for a cutie like you"""
18-09-2020T14:18:22,SageSaga,"and i was like ""Oh no! Im trapped!"""
18-09-2020T14:19:12,SageSaga,then my alarm went off and now im streaming-
18-09-2020T14:19:32,Ordithus,saved by the bell
18-09-2020T14:19:38,Titanarisium,^
18-09-2020T14:20:08,Titanarisium,Now you got me wondering what was she gonna do (I sound like an idiot saying that)
18-09-2020T14:20:24,Hogan,"Darn, your dreams are much more interesting than mine usually are :-)"
18-09-2020T14:20:32,Hogan,... I keep dreaming about work :-|
18-09-2020T14:20:59,Ordithus,what are dreams
18-09-2020T14:25:20,BlackjackSec99,vivid hallucinations that only appear when in a daily coma-like state
18-09-2020T14:26:19,Hogan,"Okay, thats one for the books Blackjack! :-)"

18-09-2020T14:45:09,K3IDRAN,I just wanna play Doom 2016 now
18-09-2020T14:45:14,K3IDRAN,but it got removed off gamepass

18-09-2020T15:04:26,TeapotOfDoom,how has dnd been going?
18-09-2020T15:04:36,SageSaga,pretty good
18-09-2020T15:04:53,TeapotOfDoom,is mihari immortal yet?
18-09-2020T15:05:08,SageSaga,not as immortal as everyone else at this point funny enough
18-09-2020T15:05:16,TeapotOfDoom,wut
18-09-2020T15:05:22,TeapotOfDoom,how is that even possible xD
18-09-2020T15:05:44,SageSaga,Tom doesnt even know yet but hes immortal-
18-09-2020T15:05:56,TeapotOfDoom,WUT
18-09-2020T15:05:56,SageSaga,so is Silver and Fluff-
18-09-2020T15:06:03,TeapotOfDoom,xD
18-09-2020T15:06:16,TeapotOfDoom,now that is a move i have not seen being pulled yet
18-09-2020T15:06:21,SageSaga,Mihari is the only one that hasnt become immortal technically-
18-09-2020T15:06:25,TeapotOfDoom,but i love the idea that sounds hilarious
18-09-2020T15:06:47,SageSaga,if Tom dies he gets reincarnated within 3 days
18-09-2020T15:07:04,SageSaga,if Silver dies he can resurrect himself within 24 hours
18-09-2020T15:07:07,Dakina,Ello
18-09-2020T15:07:09,TeapotOfDoom,last i asked they were stuck in someone else's body
18-09-2020T15:07:17,TeapotOfDoom,what has happened since then?
18-09-2020T15:07:22,SageSaga,and if Fluff dies he can come back but stuck in a random form for 24 hours
18-09-2020T15:07:24,TeapotOfDoom,clone spell?
18-09-2020T15:07:34,TeapotOfDoom,lol
18-09-2020T15:07:56,TeapotOfDoom,that's some nice immortality they got there xD
18-09-2020T15:11:18,SageSaga,Mihari doesnt get any of that- but she can turn into a dragon-
18-09-2020T15:23:27,K3IDRAN,If i die i wanna my ashes to be put into a statue of myself
18-09-2020T15:23:31,K3IDRAN,want
18-09-2020T15:23:49,SageSaga,why would you randomly say that in my stream?
18-09-2020T15:24:04,TeapotOfDoom,into a dragon?
18-09-2020T15:24:09,K3IDRAN,yeah
18-09-2020T15:24:16,K3IDRAN,plus I'm joking about the ashes
18-09-2020T15:24:39,K3IDRAN,when i'm hyper I'm not ymself
18-09-2020T15:24:40,TeapotOfDoom,like an ancient red or like a bit less op
18-09-2020T15:24:50,K3IDRAN,myself
18-09-2020T15:25:29,K3IDRAN,just a Dragon looking down at the people
18-09-2020T15:25:32,K3IDRAN,or at the ground
18-09-2020T15:25:41,TeapotOfDoom,my second level party got fucked up intentionally by a ancient red last session. catapulted into a city ripped from time
18-09-2020T15:25:53,K3IDRAN,Damn
18-09-2020T15:26:01,TeapotOfDoom,they don't know yet but they are stuck there until the whole town is freed from the time loop
18-09-2020T15:26:09,SageSaga,Adult Silver Teapot
18-09-2020T15:26:14,TeapotOfDoom,holy hell
18-09-2020T15:26:18,TeapotOfDoom,what level are they
18-09-2020T15:26:22,SageSaga,15
18-09-2020T15:26:25,TeapotOfDoom,ok
18-09-2020T15:26:26,TeapotOfDoom,ok
18-09-2020T15:26:30,TeapotOfDoom,that makes sense xD
18-09-2020T15:27:36,K3IDRAN,I don't think i can draw Ember in my crappy MS paint style xd
18-09-2020T15:28:50,TeapotOfDoom,fun thing is i wanted to do something big with them right off the bat but they are only level 2
18-09-2020T15:29:23,TeapotOfDoom,so the backstory behind the city is a bunch of bandits who made the heist of their life
18-09-2020T15:29:38,K3IDRAN,Facsinating
18-09-2020T15:29:46,K3IDRAN,Please continue
18-09-2020T15:30:10,TeapotOfDoom,"they got wind of a magical item so unstable, it can rip the material plane apart at a small scale. so they managed to get ahold of it and managed to activate it"
18-09-2020T15:30:49,K3IDRAN,Also I wanna do something more then just paint for the rest of my life
18-09-2020T15:30:50,K3IDRAN,hmm
18-09-2020T15:31:18,TeapotOfDoom,as promised it ripped a part of the material plane out of it's place but it does not care about timing. so an old city from about 150 years before their time became the victim of the incident
18-09-2020T15:31:48,TeapotOfDoom,the inhabitants are oblivious that they are stuck in a groundhog day situation. and the bandits are having the time of their life
18-09-2020T15:32:19,TeapotOfDoom,the item has split into four aspects that when brought together will reseal the power within them. which is what my party has to do now
18-09-2020T15:32:46,TeapotOfDoom,also it will destroy the item (so they can't mess with my plans)
18-09-2020T15:33:50,TeapotOfDoom,one of the aspects materialises as an ancient red in the material plane near sources of extreme wild magic. which is where they just so happened to be
18-09-2020T15:35:17,TeapotOfDoom,and the whole thing is very convenient because now the enemies are just some random bandits buffed up with some weapons they stole out of the city armery
18-09-2020T15:35:51,SpazztasticKiwi,🌊
18-09-2020T15:35:54,TeapotOfDoom,hi spazz

18-09-2020T22:14:33,AspiringNoodle,"Let me know when Windows is at the same level as those two, and then we'll talk ;)"
18-09-2020T22:15:09,SpazztasticKiwi,the air police is called the air marshel right
18-09-2020T22:15:17,Ordithus,don't think I've had a virus since XP
18-09-2020T22:15:29,AspiringNoodle,"Yeah, those are the guys who usually monitor planes"
18-09-2020T22:15:43,Ordithus,air marshals yeah
18-09-2020T22:16:12,AspiringNoodle,Anywho
18-09-2020T22:16:16,SpazztasticKiwi,is there a specific captain guy or are they all marshals aside from the supervisor
18-09-2020T22:16:32,AspiringNoodle,"Bitdefender is $36 for the first year, or I can get 3 years of Kaspersky for $104."
18-09-2020T22:16:56,Ordithus,no idea
18-09-2020T22:17:12,AspiringNoodle,Air Marshal is more or less a position
18-09-2020T22:17:37,AspiringNoodle,"If they're in plain clothes, and sit on a plane to monitor the passengers, they is Marshal"
18-09-2020T22:17:45,SpazztasticKiwi,3/$104 - ~$34 year
18-09-2020T22:18:17,AspiringNoodle,"I guess I'm asking the wrong people, lol"
18-09-2020T22:18:32,Ordithus,"I haven't paid for antivirus since 2006, so"
18-09-2020T22:18:38,AspiringNoodle,"Like, I *know* Kaspersky is the cheaper option (and I get the low price for 3 years to boot)"
18-09-2020T22:19:12,AspiringNoodle,Windows is perfectly fine if you generally play it safe online
18-09-2020T22:19:28,AspiringNoodle,"But the moment you venture to riskier sites, it's not really adequate"
18-09-2020T22:20:01,Ordithus,then don't go there?
18-09-2020T22:20:14,AspiringNoodle,"Here's a question, what defines a ""risky"" site?"
18-09-2020T22:20:33,SpazztasticKiwi,did Tom every day he was wanting ideas to count as suggestions from patreons
18-09-2020T22:20:58,SpazztasticKiwi,ever say
18-09-2020T22:22:50,Ordithus,I remember him saying he was welcoming ideas for the vote incentive a while back
18-09-2020T22:26:21,SpazztasticKiwi,oh cool
18-09-2020T22:26:29,SpazztasticKiwi,I probably missed that
18-09-2020T22:26:43,SpazztasticKiwi,I wonder if he’d like the idea of themes
18-09-2020T22:27:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I got an idea I could run by him for that too though
18-09-2020T22:27:24,SpazztasticKiwi,did he say to put it here or is he ok if I messaged it on patreon
18-09-2020T22:28:11,Ordithus,probably email
18-09-2020T22:28:30,SpazztasticKiwi,& do you think the mike boobification & pen gimmick has overstayed its welcome
18-09-2020T22:29:04,SpazztasticKiwi,because I have an idea for a continuation but not if everyone’s tired of it
18-09-2020T22:29:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ll ask when he’s on next if he’d like an email
18-09-2020T22:29:33,Ordithus,so many questions
