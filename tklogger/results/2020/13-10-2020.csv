13-10-2020T18:54:52,AspiringNoodle,My parent's / grandparents can't seem to comprehend the idea of NOT wanting to eat out at an indoor only restaurant that isn't exactly ventilation friendly

13-10-2020T19:06:12,AspiringNoodle,Restaurants are the perfect breeding ground for COVID.  Capacity restrictions be damned.  You are literally inviting large groups of people to spend over an hour indoors with their masks off.
13-10-2020T19:07:08,Ordithus,"Yep. Restaurants/bars and other social gatherings are driving a lot of cases. Weddings, funerals, too."

13-10-2020T19:13:38,AspiringNoodle,We are nearing (and will eventually exceed) infection rates from way back in spring
13-10-2020T19:15:00,AspiringNoodle,"All these infections in the US are allowing COVID to mutate rapidly.  Apparently new infections are being spurred on by a newer strain with higher infectivity, but no change in lethality"
13-10-2020T19:15:30,AspiringNoodle,But JFC has the US done the shittiest job possible in stopping this thing
13-10-2020T19:16:50,Ordithus,stopping? barely slowed it down

13-10-2020T19:56:32,Ordithus,true
13-10-2020T19:56:55,Ordithus,I will not forget the time I was at a car dealership and the salesman went to go show a customer the turbo in an acura rsx
13-10-2020T19:57:03,Ordithus,acura rsx did not have a turbo
13-10-2020T19:57:04,AspiringNoodle,"Is like, ""Bish, unless you paying at LEAST $15 an hour, don't expect me to be anymore knowledgeable than where stuff is, and how to check people out."""

13-10-2020T20:02:37,Ordithus,willingness to learn is a big thingy thing
13-10-2020T20:02:49,AspiringNoodle,The store is staffing / scheduling like every employee knows exactly what to do for every situation
13-10-2020T20:03:03,AspiringNoodle,But you don't get to that point until months down the road
13-10-2020T20:04:12,AspiringNoodle,"If something needs done, it needs done.  But if customers are streaming in when said thing needs done, we gotta skip thel esson and let the experienced person do it >_>"
