19-10-2020T14:15:57,AspiringNoodle,I've been experiencing some stability issues in the game recently
19-10-2020T14:17:14,AspiringNoodle,"And it can happen even if the game is running in the background at a significantly reduced framerate.  If I'm in a web browser, it'll be noticed as a moment of unresponsiveness, with the task popping up with WoW's icon flickering in and out of existence"

19-10-2020T19:27:36,AspiringNoodle,"Games companies are doing this shit to avoid the, rightfully, negative press they'd get if this shit was in the game at launch."
19-10-2020T19:28:09,AspiringNoodle,"They hold off on it, let the reviews go out, make sure no more outlets are reviewing the game, or will change their reviews, THEN do it."
19-10-2020T19:28:26,AspiringNoodle,"Late enough to avoid backlash, and late enough where if people are going to buy the game, they probably did."

19-10-2020T19:30:35,CrRAR,Some have ditched the word 'decent'
19-10-2020T19:30:54,CrRAR,I play things occationally
19-10-2020T19:31:37,AspiringNoodle,you like action rpgs?

19-10-2020T19:40:45,CrRAR,ha
19-10-2020T19:40:57,AspiringNoodle,Some game called Dou Shan Zen made years ago.  It was their equivalent of a AAA game
19-10-2020T19:41:30,AspiringNoodle,Was an online MMO-type dealie.  But apparently Tencent pushed the developers into doing something that made a huge portion of the playerbase up and leave.
19-10-2020T19:42:01,AspiringNoodle,"They further monetized the game after that, and while the developers worked their butts off to undo the damage, by the time they did it was too late.  If people had already left, they stayed away after that."
19-10-2020T19:42:29,CrRAR,Game companies getting catty
19-10-2020T19:42:35,AspiringNoodle,"Hence the ""fire"" ""rebuilt"" and ""no followers"" remarks."
19-10-2020T19:43:11,AspiringNoodle,I do believe the game eventually died
19-10-2020T19:45:31,AspiringNoodle,"Also, if you haven't figured it out yet, the game is about Sun Wukong"
19-10-2020T19:45:37,AspiringNoodle,He basically Chinese Superman

19-10-2020T19:50:55,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,Whatâ€™s your favorite era of cars? (Like 40 or 60
19-10-2020T19:51:41,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,(Like 40s or 60s etc)*
19-10-2020T19:51:48,AspiringNoodle,"Dude, if I was a game developer in China"
19-10-2020T19:51:52,AspiringNoodle,And I saw that trailer
19-10-2020T19:52:11,AspiringNoodle,I'd be firing off an application to their studio so fast I'd bring down their freaking modern internet infrastructure
19-10-2020T19:52:15,CrRAR,"Umm, some 70s cars are nice"
19-10-2020T19:52:32,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,I love the 50s cars
19-10-2020T19:52:43,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,The bel-air
19-10-2020T19:52:48,CrRAR,Certain cars had their good and bad decades
19-10-2020T19:53:11,CrRAR,The mustang was nice even I'm the50/60s
19-10-2020T19:53:24,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,I didnâ€™t like 2000-2010s look at all XD
19-10-2020T19:53:49,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,(From the video)
19-10-2020T19:54:00,AspiringNoodle,mid 1980's - mid 2000's cars were GARBAGE
19-10-2020T19:54:19,AspiringNoodle,"There were a few good designs coming out (like the 2001 ford escape I had for a long time), but most of them were bleh"
19-10-2020T19:54:20,CrRAR,",60'smoreso I guess for the mustangs"
19-10-2020T19:54:47,AspiringNoodle,"For w/e reason, the soul of designing cars died in the 80's"
19-10-2020T19:54:55,AspiringNoodle,Didn't come back until 20 - 30 years later
19-10-2020T19:55:01,CrRAR,Any cars from the detectivin' days were flashy
19-10-2020T19:55:14,CrRAR,Like from noir films
19-10-2020T19:55:29,CrRAR,Dick Tracy days~
19-10-2020T19:55:35,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,I like d one 80s car
19-10-2020T19:55:39,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,Liked*
19-10-2020T19:56:01,CrRAR,Delorean?
19-10-2020T19:56:22,CrRAR,Or was that 90s?
19-10-2020T19:56:55,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,"No, the Buick grand national"
19-10-2020T19:57:04,AspiringNoodle,fun fact: the whole 88 mph shtick from back to the future is because deloreans weren't that fast xD
19-10-2020T19:57:23,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,It was in partnership with McLaren tho
19-10-2020T19:57:24,CrRAR,Buick did have some nice cars once upon atime
19-10-2020T19:57:35,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,Thatâ€™s probably why I like it XD
19-10-2020T19:58:46,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,Did you see it?
19-10-2020T20:00:32,AspiringNoodle,holy fudge

19-10-2020T20:03:10,AspiringNoodle,I'm in shock at how big a difference this new box is making
19-10-2020T20:03:34,AspiringNoodle,I'm realizing how much the old one was holding back the experience.  I feel like I need to watch Gravity Falls in full to rectify this situation.

19-10-2020T20:10:58,CrRAR,I can't remember precisely what happened but I remember that episode was somewhat disturbing
19-10-2020T20:11:18,CrRAR,Most Nicktoons of that era were in retrospect xD
19-10-2020T20:11:24,AspiringNoodle,"Honestly, any cartoon from the late 80's - entire 90's was straight nightmare fuel"

19-10-2020T20:12:07,AspiringNoodle,I *loved* courage when I was younger
19-10-2020T20:12:22,CrRAR,That show had already come to terms with that it was disturbing and ran with it.
19-10-2020T20:12:24,AspiringNoodle,"But looking back, how the f*ck was I not terrified of that Grade A nightmare fuel???"
19-10-2020T20:12:30,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,Imagine a keidran or one of those monkeys with no fur on there butt

19-10-2020T20:13:15,AspiringNoodle,I've watched every episode multiple times at this point
19-10-2020T20:13:18,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,Only One episode tho
19-10-2020T20:13:40,CrRAR,Evil space chicken was the pilot episode

19-10-2020T20:15:15,AspiringNoodle,Indeed he was
19-10-2020T20:15:34,CrRAR,The 'concept' Hey Arnold episode was also VERY trippy
19-10-2020T20:15:40,CrRAR,It was claymation
19-10-2020T20:15:48,CrRAR,Also mildly disturbing
19-10-2020T20:16:02,CrRAR,I THINK that was it's pilot at least
19-10-2020T20:16:40,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,Thatâ€™s the show with the pink dog right?
19-10-2020T20:16:55,CrRAR,Yup!
19-10-2020T20:16:55,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,I watched it a VERY long time ago
19-10-2020T20:17:06,CrRAR,He was a 'twit'
19-10-2020T20:17:15,CrRAR,...according to the computer

19-10-2020T20:17:54,CrRAR,It was also a villian at one point I think
19-10-2020T20:18:08,CrRAR,Near the end season though
19-10-2020T20:18:18,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,Think so
19-10-2020T20:18:31,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,I remember something faintly
19-10-2020T20:18:35,CrRAR,I know Courage got sucked in in 3D
19-10-2020T20:18:51,AspiringNoodle,"Iirc, the computer got a virus"
19-10-2020T20:19:06,CrRAR,Yeah it may have been a medusa lady
19-10-2020T20:19:09,AspiringNoodle,And it caused it to become mobile by manipulating wires or pipes or something connected to it
19-10-2020T20:19:23,AspiringNoodle,"Allowed it to become mobile, but I can't remember what it was doing in particular"
19-10-2020T20:19:25,CrRAR,or not that could have just been Muriel
19-10-2020T20:20:10,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,Is the show still going!

19-10-2020T20:21:23,AspiringNoodle,I don't know what it is...
19-10-2020T20:21:33,AspiringNoodle,But having such an improved image on TV is calming

19-10-2020T20:31:02,AspiringNoodle,It was able to connect into the TV in ways the old one was not.
19-10-2020T20:31:49,AspiringNoodle,I can now actually change the input through the new remote.
19-10-2020T20:32:01,AspiringNoodle,Now the only reason I have to use the old one is if I need to change the TV's settings

19-10-2020T22:45:05,AspiringNoodle,"Hmmm, nah, that paints him in a bad light.  I'd argue that he has a self-deprecating humor."
