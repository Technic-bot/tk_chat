11-02-2020T00:02:19,CrRAR,"Sad, because the slackers in that situation win yet AGAIN!"
11-02-2020T00:07:21,AspiringNoodle,I find that the main problem with retail is that they want to schedule as few people as possible
11-02-2020T00:07:31,AspiringNoodle,"I mean, I get it, labor is the easiest cost you can control"
11-02-2020T00:07:54,AspiringNoodle,"But at the same time, if someone doesn't show or quits, and you're already running at the bare minimum, it's gonna become a giant circus trying to get your bases covered"
11-02-2020T00:08:14,AspiringNoodle,When companies could EASILY rectify this and make the work environment more relaxed by having a buffer of an employee or two

11-02-2020T16:51:58,tehbear,lots of dishes?
11-02-2020T16:52:12,CrimsonQuill,Yes.
11-02-2020T16:59:48,tehbear,"ive been very stressed lately, and i guess ive been drinking too much coffee"
11-02-2020T17:00:03,tehbear,should convert to tea 100% :ctwokinds-kingtea:
11-02-2020T17:00:49,tehbear,"also, lots of future work stuff coming up and im stressed about that"
11-02-2020T17:02:12,CrimsonQuill,I'm trying to do too much at once in my spare time...
11-02-2020T17:02:33,CrimsonQuill,"Between books, video games, drawing, listening to music and watching music, i feel paralyzed."
11-02-2020T17:02:39,CrimsonQuill,I feel like I have to do it all.
11-02-2020T17:03:30,funnyman42,"I have the oposite problem.  I have all these things I want to do, but I feel like I can't."
11-02-2020T17:03:52,tehbear,ive also been doing that lately. burning the candle in both ends. usually ends with a crash.
11-02-2020T17:04:02,CrimsonQuill,Indeed
11-02-2020T17:05:38,tehbear,usually this happens to me in the winter months also.
11-02-2020T17:09:39,CrimsonQuill,I see
11-02-2020T17:10:09,tehbear,in summer im better at balancing work/home projects and just having fun
11-02-2020T17:11:06,CrimsonQuill,"Well, for me, it's been a problem for a few years."
11-02-2020T17:11:25,CrimsonQuill,"I feel like I have to do everything at once, and then I do nothing"
11-02-2020T17:11:37,CrimsonQuill,"I feel like it all has to happen ""Now"""
11-02-2020T17:11:47,tehbear,"i know that feeling, its paralyzing"
11-02-2020T17:11:52,CrimsonQuill,never going for a more sustainable move.

11-02-2020T17:12:09,CrimsonQuill,It's kinda like corporations and profits to be honest
11-02-2020T17:12:33,CrimsonQuill,"On top of that, today I'm trying to prevent myself from having a bad habit relapse. It's very tough."
11-02-2020T17:13:31,tehbear,i cant say i have any advice but the first step is to acknowledge it
11-02-2020T17:15:04,CrimsonQuill,"Well, I managed to do that so far.."
11-02-2020T17:15:52,CrimsonQuill,"The problem I always have is even when I recognize it and what I need to do to prevent it, I take the path of least resistance and relapse anyway. So I have to watch for that too."
11-02-2020T17:15:59,CrimsonQuill,But I'll get there.
11-02-2020T17:16:02,CrimsonQuill,Baby steps.
11-02-2020T17:25:09,tehbear,"if taking all measures is too hard, try to do 1"
11-02-2020T17:25:22,CrimsonQuill,??
11-02-2020T17:25:34,CrimsonQuill,is confused
11-02-2020T17:26:01,tehbear,"if the problem is that youre doing too many things, try to do 1 thing less."
11-02-2020T17:26:25,CrimsonQuill,Ah
11-02-2020T17:26:28,CrimsonQuill,I See
11-02-2020T17:26:30,CrimsonQuill,Thanks
11-02-2020T17:34:33,tehbear,this reminds me of the little book of calm scene in black books
11-02-2020T17:34:41,CrimsonQuill,Oh?
11-02-2020T17:34:56,tehbear,how manny is stressed out in his accountant job
11-02-2020T17:35:08,tehbear,"and reads the little book of calm, but it doesnt help him"

11-02-2020T17:35:45,CrimsonQuill,Well
11-02-2020T17:35:45,tehbear,i was surprised the little book of calm is an actual thing and not something they just made up
11-02-2020T17:35:52,CrimsonQuill,Wait. What?
11-02-2020T17:35:58,CrimsonQuill,Pardon?

11-02-2020T17:40:22,tehbear,but its funny in black books
11-02-2020T17:40:41,tehbear,Manny ends up eating the book somehow and becomes completely zen

11-02-2020T17:43:45,tehbear,i think he almost choked to death and went to hospital
11-02-2020T17:44:05,CrimsonQuill,XD
11-02-2020T17:44:06,tehbear,"but he rises again, in the hospital gown and looks like jesus"

11-02-2020T21:52:30,AspiringNoodle,"And apparently some of the issues might be fixable- if the company was willing to pony up, lol"
11-02-2020T21:52:43,AspiringNoodle,But I like our manager
11-02-2020T21:53:01,AspiringNoodle,"And so, I'm making an exception to my 3-day work availability for him :P"
11-02-2020T21:53:45,AspiringNoodle,"(it's not that I refuse to work more than 4 days a week, I just don't want to be consistently scheduled above 3, but I'll cover the occasional shift)"
