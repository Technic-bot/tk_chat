08-11-2020T01:06:50,KeefMcDerpface,aaawwwww
08-11-2020T01:08:28,AspiringNoodle,Time to find out how this sub stacks up to a local pizza joint
08-11-2020T01:09:02,AspiringNoodle,"This pizza place's half-sub costs $8, but it's basically the same as this full sub I got from the store for $9.30"

08-11-2020T01:25:19,AspiringNoodle,"But I am spoiled by local pizza joints, lol"
08-11-2020T01:25:31,AspiringNoodle,"Heck, the subs where I work I think are better if I add mayo to them"
08-11-2020T01:26:20,AspiringNoodle,"So now all I need is to get a sub from the pizza joint 3 min from home, and decide which is better.  And if it's worth the 15 min drive to the other place, haha"
08-11-2020T01:26:49,CrRAR,yeah some places are good for one thing in paticular
08-11-2020T01:28:36,SpazztasticKiwi,so I got distracted
08-11-2020T01:28:57,CrRAR,did you now? haha
08-11-2020T01:29:13,AspiringNoodle,"Not while driving, I hope"
08-11-2020T01:29:50,CrRAR,How is bagheera coping with coat day 2?
08-11-2020T01:30:43,Dadrobit,"Back, went and watched Borat 2."
08-11-2020T01:30:57,Dadrobit,Got some laughs. Mostly just made me sad.

08-11-2020T01:33:41,Dadrobit,The last third or so was the stuff of nightmares.
08-11-2020T01:33:43,CrRAR,Was it from all the aggressive coat distraction eating?
08-11-2020T01:35:18,CrRAR,"Nuclear can be okay I guess as long as it's well funded, I just think it seems like poorly maintained/forgotten/neglected reactors due to funding lead to the problems we've historically seen"
08-11-2020T01:35:54,CrRAR,It does seem to be an unecessary hazard esp with the other clean energy methods we have now
08-11-2020T01:36:27,AspiringNoodle,"The thing is, no new nuclear plants (to my knowledge) have been built in like, over half a century."

08-11-2020T01:37:50,CrRAR,ah dang
08-11-2020T01:38:15,CrRAR,maybe at 3AM during turbo zoomies
08-11-2020T01:38:25,SpazztasticKiwi,he feels like he’s losing weight
08-11-2020T01:39:00,CrRAR,aww
08-11-2020T01:47:52,CrRAR,Has he otherwise been his usual old self?
08-11-2020T01:48:51,SpazztasticKiwi,a regular little shite
08-11-2020T01:49:25,SpazztasticKiwi,but I’ve yet to catch him eating his hard food
08-11-2020T01:52:07,AspiringNoodle,Has he flipped the bowl in recent times?
08-11-2020T01:53:48,SpazztasticKiwi,he’s had no problem talking hard treats so it’s like he’s just not hungry
08-11-2020T01:54:17,SpazztasticKiwi,but he can’t be getting enough anywhere else to not be because he gets fed when I get home at night
08-11-2020T01:54:50,SpazztasticKiwi,I do have some wet food I was gonna split between him and Kiwi but https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/524825976597643265/775251531649384458/image0.jpg

08-11-2020T17:30:49,AspiringNoodle,It was about one of the *biggest* scandals in game show history.
08-11-2020T17:31:43,AspiringNoodle,"I remember calling the period the ""Golden Age of Television"".  Can't remember where I got that descriptor from, but it was definitely true.  This scandal was smack dab in an era where game shows and other big programs were watched almost universally."

08-11-2020T17:33:19,AspiringNoodle,"I need to look it up.   This show was known for having two contestants compete in trivia, but each contestant was locked in a separate sound-proofed booth."
08-11-2020T17:34:21,AspiringNoodle,"It was a huge scandal because all the ""winners"" were pre-picked.  If you won fairly and were popular, they'd start giving you the questions and answers in advance."
08-11-2020T17:34:50,AspiringNoodle,"And when your popularity started fading, they'd want you to take a dive."
08-11-2020T17:41:28,CrimsonQuill,I'm (Supposed) to be writing an essay on the management of Marine Spatial Planning (Essentially how surveyors and logistics can handle environmental and physical challenges around the coast) by reviewing a series of texts.
