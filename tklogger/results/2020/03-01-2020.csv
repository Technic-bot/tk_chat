03-01-2020T01:30:06,MrEase,"wolf disguised as a human, cursed by door magic to become a chicken"
03-01-2020T01:30:11,FloofyCat,"Ah yes, um. Beer sausage world war"
03-01-2020T01:30:14,Tjimmy1999,I wonder why Nora's spell worn off.
03-01-2020T01:30:40,Tjimmy1999,And why is Brutus naked (not that I'm complaining)?
03-01-2020T01:30:41,CrRAR,great mystery
03-01-2020T01:30:43,InTheLionsDen,Brutus has an anti-magic bite.
03-01-2020T01:30:50,FloofyCat,"I dunno, guessing hurting dispels it or some other thing happened."
03-01-2020T01:31:02,BadFoMo,"As much as I am agenst turning others into farm animals, I like the look of Roan's eye in panel 2."
03-01-2020T01:31:12,CrRAR,haha
03-01-2020T01:31:15,KeefMcDerpface,"Either way, lucky wolf/chicken."
03-01-2020T01:31:28,Dadrobit,"Wolf disguised as a human, turned into a chicken, holding a sign reading, ""eat most tigers."""

03-01-2020T01:33:27,LannAF,it counts as negative 1
03-01-2020T01:33:28,SageSaga,"max our charisma- take levels in warlock, bard, and sorcerer"

03-01-2020T01:39:49,BadFoMo,Picarto! WTF?!
03-01-2020T01:40:04,CrRAR,you advanced
03-01-2020T01:40:44,CrRAR,Picarto: Your Experience May Vary!
03-01-2020T01:40:48,CrRAR,(a lot)
03-01-2020T01:42:30,Dadrobit,For real tho. It's actually pretty astonishing how true that is. Their app in particular is so unreasonably sub-par.
03-01-2020T01:42:51,CrRAR,"yes, very cludgy"
03-01-2020T01:43:31,DarthRexKing,What is this song?
03-01-2020T01:44:18,SageSaga,which song?
03-01-2020T01:44:28,DarthRexKing,The one playing now. X3
03-01-2020T01:44:43,SageSaga,on my stream- Rightfully
03-01-2020T01:44:50,DarthRexKing,Okies. :3
03-01-2020T01:46:51,LannAF,Hey Sage!
03-01-2020T01:46:55,LannAF,you watching Oresuki yet?
03-01-2020T01:47:04,SageSaga,not yet but it is on the list
03-01-2020T01:47:09,DarthRexKing,Japanese have such good music. ;3;
03-01-2020T01:47:19,SageSaga,i will probably have time with the lineup for Winter not looking so good
03-01-2020T01:47:36,KeefMcDerpface,Yes they do DarthRex.
03-01-2020T01:48:21,HisBrideDraws,Haii <3
03-01-2020T01:48:25,DarthRexKing,X3
03-01-2020T01:48:31,LannAF,oh is it not?
03-01-2020T01:48:51,JeremySenpai,Hoi Hisbride
03-01-2020T01:49:15,FoxxTrotter,:cfoxxtrotter-FoxEye:
03-01-2020T01:49:29,SageSaga,there's an anime about a little human girl that gets picked up by a Golem - that looks kinda interesting
03-01-2020T01:50:00,SageSaga,there's an edgy Isekai looking anime
03-01-2020T01:50:17,LannAF,Little human girl already sets me on edge
03-01-2020T01:50:21,LannAF,"also, how edgy"
03-01-2020T01:50:22,SageSaga,and theres the anime version of Nekopara
03-01-2020T01:50:33,LannAF,what's a nekopara
03-01-2020T01:50:49,LannAF,oh
03-01-2020T01:50:53,SageSaga,:P
03-01-2020T01:51:00,LannAF,I
03-01-2020T01:51:09,LannAF,probably shoulda been able to guess that lol
03-01-2020T01:51:22,SageSaga,the edgy one looks like it has a guy with black flames coming from his fist- so - preeeetty edgy bro
03-01-2020T01:51:34,LannAF,oof
03-01-2020T01:51:37,LannAF,that's maximum edgy
03-01-2020T01:52:16,SageSaga,and theres the original Edgy anime getting a remake- Orphen!
03-01-2020T01:53:05,SageSaga,so those are the main list
03-01-2020T01:53:08,SageSaga,for all of winter
03-01-2020T01:53:34,LannAF,eeeeh
03-01-2020T01:53:37,LannAF,edgy's not my thing
03-01-2020T01:53:45,JeremySenpai,I have yet to make my watch list. Due to Vacation I need to catch up
03-01-2020T01:53:51,SageSaga,some edgy stuff is alright
03-01-2020T01:54:05,SageSaga,oh but we do get Isekai Quartet season 2!
03-01-2020T01:54:08,SageSaga,10 days from now
03-01-2020T01:54:22,JeremySenpai,:cjeremysenpai-ezgifcom-gif-m-0:
03-01-2020T01:54:54,Dadrobit,"Bbl, gonna do some actual work now."
03-01-2020T01:55:12,LannAF,oh that's pretty good
03-01-2020T01:56:23,CrRAR,bye robit
03-01-2020T01:56:52,BadFoMo,Bye.
03-01-2020T01:56:55,SageSaga,oh btw- i thought i was gonna get tired of and drop Overly Cautious Hero - and just keep watching Wrestler in another world-
03-01-2020T01:57:03,SageSaga,but they swapped places in my enjoyment
03-01-2020T01:57:12,BadFoMo,I think I bay take a nap now.
03-01-2020T01:57:30,CrRAR,okay
03-01-2020T01:57:35,BadFoMo,*may
03-01-2020T01:57:36,KeefMcDerpface,Bye FoMo.
03-01-2020T01:57:54,LannAF,Yeah Wrestler was
03-01-2020T01:57:55,LannAF,eugh.
03-01-2020T01:58:01,LannAF,overly cautious was great
03-01-2020T01:58:20,SageSaga,Wrestler had so much promise- but went nowhere
03-01-2020T01:58:38,SageSaga,i cant believe it was written by the same person that did Konosuba
03-01-2020T01:59:30,LannAF,yeah it fell flat on its face SO HARD
03-01-2020T01:59:33,LannAF,like aqua
03-01-2020T01:59:36,SageSaga,and Overly Cautious hero feels more like Konosuba
03-01-2020T01:59:52,SageSaga,and just went into serious storytelling mode- havent seen the last episode
03-01-2020T01:59:59,LannAF,ooooooooooo you should
03-01-2020T02:00:11,SageSaga,i will soon
03-01-2020T02:00:22,LannAF,yeah I liked that
03-01-2020T02:00:51,LannAF,it was still more shallow in terms of plot depth than most other story-centered anime
03-01-2020T02:01:05,LannAF,but it was nice to not heavily think about it and enjoy it for what it was
03-01-2020T02:01:06,SageSaga,Radiant is still enjoyable- and so is Black Clover- even if the art has some of the lowest lows- their highs are great and its fast paced
03-01-2020T02:02:03,LannAF,radiant?
03-01-2020T02:02:19,LannAF,also sorry if I'm keeping you from working fully on your work xD
03-01-2020T02:02:45,SageSaga,google Radiant anime and watch a video on it or something
03-01-2020T02:02:59,LannAF,oh it's literally just called radiant
03-01-2020T02:03:01,SageSaga,its a Shonen story- the dub actually has ProDZ
03-01-2020T02:03:12,SageSaga,or is it ProZD
03-01-2020T02:03:22,SageSaga,Sung Won
03-01-2020T02:03:38,SageSaga,or as we like to call him SANG WAAANG
03-01-2020T02:04:02,LannAF,:OOOO
03-01-2020T02:04:08,LannAF,I watched the premise
03-01-2020T02:04:12,LannAF,it looks great
03-01-2020T02:04:24,SageSaga,it starts kinda slow
03-01-2020T02:04:30,SageSaga,but it ramps up and gets interesting
03-01-2020T02:04:34,SageSaga,and it looks nice
03-01-2020T02:04:46,LannAF,will recommend to sticky o7
03-01-2020T02:04:52,SageSaga,reminds me of a cross between Naruto and One Piece
03-01-2020T02:04:58,LannAF,oooo
03-01-2020T02:05:04,SageSaga,maybe more like Fairy Tail
03-01-2020T02:05:20,SageSaga,it is its own thing
03-01-2020T02:05:25,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Ow0 Fairy tail?
03-01-2020T02:05:53,LannAF,I heard badish things about fairy tail?
03-01-2020T02:05:57,LannAF,also hi again marv
03-01-2020T02:06:05,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Ello
03-01-2020T02:06:41,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Fairy tail is bad in a good way
03-01-2020T02:06:48,SageSaga,it's also kinda funny to have a character named Seth and not a Japanese person alive can say his name right
03-01-2020T02:06:58,LannAF,hahaha
03-01-2020T02:07:17,SageSaga,he might as well be Seto Kaiba
03-01-2020T02:07:49,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Seto was my first anime crush
03-01-2020T02:08:15,SageSaga,mmhmm yeah- him and all that money
03-01-2020T02:08:17,SageSaga,so hot
03-01-2020T02:08:18,ZRO4825,Fairy Tail is <3
03-01-2020T02:08:44,SageSaga,i gotta get some water and take a quick break- i'll be back in a bit!

03-01-2020T02:45:25,ZRO4825,I can't wait for Overwatch 2. Actual PVE content will be so nice. <3
03-01-2020T02:45:45,ZRO4825,I've adjusted to the PVP factor of it...somewhat...but damn if being able to take a break from it wouldn't be nice.
03-01-2020T02:46:19,ZRO4825,"I'll happily play MHW with you, so long as you accept that I'm not quite on yours and Mihari's level. :joy:"

03-01-2020T03:45:54,JeremySenpai,well that escalated quickly
03-01-2020T03:46:43,SageSaga,easier to just redraw it
03-01-2020T03:52:08,ZRO4825,"Yes, must correctly balance the Dark Elf. By making sure to not quite max out the bust slider. O.O"

03-01-2020T04:11:21,JeremySenpai,but the doc said I has the Anesthesiologist on his toes when I did that
03-01-2020T04:12:26,SageSaga,i had a pleasant dream while I was out

03-01-2020T04:15:43,AspiringNoodle,I know this because there was a swamp with purple and gold koi fish.  And the psych book had purple and gold goldfish on the cover

03-01-2020T05:13:13,JeremySenpai,mostly because its pro work I think

03-01-2020T05:18:20,JeremySenpai,I can't remember what this piece was for. But I have one of her Mikus in the same costume

03-01-2020T15:15:27,BadFoMo,Ah. I figerd it was tests.
03-01-2020T15:15:32,CrimsonQuill,Hi there Teapot!
03-01-2020T15:15:33,SageSaga,yo Teapot
03-01-2020T15:16:31,TeapotOfDoom,Hi Quill!
03-01-2020T15:17:19,Ordithus,:ptv-excited: fancy whirly engines
03-01-2020T15:20:26,SageSaga,it's just a toy steam engine o_o
03-01-2020T15:20:45,Ordithus,"""just"" that thing looks fun"
03-01-2020T15:21:37,SageSaga,you never played with one growing up?
03-01-2020T15:22:29,neropan,Ayoo
03-01-2020T15:22:36,SageSaga,yo Nero
03-01-2020T15:22:40,Ordithus,"nope, but that doesn't change the fact that it's awesome"
03-01-2020T15:26:01,CrimsonQuill,"I have an electrically powered ""Thomas Kincade"" set my aunt got me in an auction..."
03-01-2020T15:26:18,CrimsonQuill,"It has two ""steam"" locomotives, three carriages and a good few tracks."
03-01-2020T15:26:29,CrimsonQuill,"I barely use it now...not enough space, not enough time."
03-01-2020T15:28:33,SageSaga,these old steam engine toys are to show the proof of concept of how steam engines work to young people- you put a tea candle under the boiler and once it starts boiling you give  the wheel a little push and it will continue till it runs out of water or ya
03-01-2020T15:28:37,SageSaga,remove the heat source
03-01-2020T15:29:25,Ordithus,a few folks at work have mini stirling engines that run off the heat from a cup of coffee
03-01-2020T15:29:44,SageSaga,yep ive seen those- those are newer XD
03-01-2020T15:29:47,CrimsonQuill,"It's quite interestingm when you think about it, that whatever the power source is-coal, solar, oil-it all, in the end, powers steam."
03-01-2020T15:29:53,CrimsonQuill,Steam powers the world...
03-01-2020T15:30:12,Ordithus,don't forget nuclear
03-01-2020T15:30:34,CrimsonQuill,I actually support the idea of Nuclear power...as long as it's used safely.
03-01-2020T15:30:52,CrimsonQuill,"And with other, more renewable sources of power to back it up."
03-01-2020T15:31:40,SageSaga,i really wish they would give thorium reactors a shot
03-01-2020T15:31:51,CrimsonQuill,What's thorium?
03-01-2020T15:32:02,SageSaga,its a low energy nuclear material
03-01-2020T15:32:39,SageSaga,"we have absolutely massive amounts of it- its pretty safe, and can be used for low energy reactions to create steam"
03-01-2020T15:32:45,Ordithus,is the waste less hazardous?
03-01-2020T15:32:46,SageSaga,so it cant ever go critical
03-01-2020T15:32:56,SageSaga,yeah less waste too
03-01-2020T15:33:34,SageSaga,"it doesnt produce massive bursts of heat  - it's more of a slow burn, but the cost of the material- we legit have billions of tons of it doing nothing"
03-01-2020T15:33:49,CrimsonQuill,Then we should use it
03-01-2020T15:34:15,CrimsonQuill,But knowing the world there'll be procrastination and prevarication to protect business interests in other sources...
03-01-2020T15:36:31,SageSaga,thorium is so safe you can just load it into a reactor by hand XD
03-01-2020T15:36:40,CrimsonQuill,Wow.
03-01-2020T15:36:50,CrimsonQuill,"And you say we have tons of the stuff,"
03-01-2020T15:36:54,CrimsonQuill,Wheesh
03-01-2020T15:38:02,SageSaga,also because it is low energy- it cant be used to make weapons
03-01-2020T15:38:14,CrimsonQuill,Very handy.
03-01-2020T15:39:42,SageSaga,oh and only about 1% of uranium mined is usable while 100% of thorium is usable because it's so low energy
03-01-2020T15:40:46,Ordithus,"So what you're saying is, I can power my toy steam engine with thorium"
03-01-2020T15:41:22,SageSaga,hmmm- you might need a bigger one to get the reaction high even to make the heat needed
03-01-2020T15:41:25,SageSaga,but yes?
03-01-2020T15:42:22,CrimsonQuill,"It's essentially lower amounts of power at more sustainable rates, isn't it?"
03-01-2020T15:42:45,SageSaga,yep
03-01-2020T15:43:07,SageSaga,it also lasts a lot longer- its lower energy output over a longer amount of time
03-01-2020T15:43:19,TeapotOfDoom,i see we're talking about thorium reactors
03-01-2020T15:43:25,CrimsonQuill,Yep
03-01-2020T15:43:49,TeapotOfDoom,molten salt is neat concept
03-01-2020T15:44:02,TeapotOfDoom,inherently safe as well i hear
03-01-2020T15:44:21,CrimsonQuill,Molten salt is a very good power generation method
03-01-2020T15:44:28,CrimsonQuill,"Once heated, it stays hot for a while"
03-01-2020T15:45:05,TeapotOfDoom,no i mean the moderator for thorium reactors is molten salt if i remember correctly
03-01-2020T15:45:32,CrimsonQuill,Ohkay
03-01-2020T15:45:41,SageSaga,yeah i think it was molten salt was part of the safety mechanism
03-01-2020T15:45:46,TeapotOfDoom,the neat thing is if you remove it the reaction immediatly stops and no core meltdown
03-01-2020T15:46:08,TeapotOfDoom,also way shorter half life
03-01-2020T15:46:15,TeapotOfDoom,no part 3 needed
03-01-2020T15:46:21,CrimsonQuill,Yep
03-01-2020T15:46:23,CrimsonQuill,Oh God
03-01-2020T15:46:26,CrimsonQuill,Oh no
03-01-2020T15:46:33,TeapotOfDoom,sry had to make that reference
03-01-2020T15:46:38,CrimsonQuill,"No, not that"
03-01-2020T15:46:44,CrimsonQuill,Just been reading the news
03-01-2020T15:46:46,CrimsonQuill,...
03-01-2020T15:46:49,TeapotOfDoom,hm?
03-01-2020T15:46:55,TeapotOfDoom,oh noes is it trum
03-01-2020T15:46:59,TeapotOfDoom,trump
03-01-2020T15:47:04,CrimsonQuill,Yes.
03-01-2020T15:47:06,TeapotOfDoom,please tell me it's not trump
03-01-2020T15:47:10,TeapotOfDoom,oh fuck
03-01-2020T15:47:12,CrimsonQuill,It unfortunately is.
03-01-2020T15:47:25,TeapotOfDoom,ima go look
03-01-2020T15:47:26,CrimsonQuill,I just am sick and tired of seeing rising tensions in the news.
03-01-2020T15:47:27,SageSaga,=_= what's happened now
03-01-2020T15:47:33,TeapotOfDoom,1-10 how bad
03-01-2020T15:47:38,CrimsonQuill,Saw an article from the morning
03-01-2020T15:48:00,CrimsonQuill,About how people are being advised to leave the middle East ASAP
03-01-2020T15:48:11,CrimsonQuill,How a few rockets have landed near the US Embassy and Base
03-01-2020T15:48:37,CrimsonQuill,And how a efforts to free a British Charity Worker imprisoned in Iran could be jeopardized.
03-01-2020T15:49:37,Ordithus,"could people please stop killing each other for once, k"
03-01-2020T15:51:09,CrimsonQuill,I am hoping to God that these tensions are simmered down.
03-01-2020T15:51:51,SageSaga,ok i gotta ask- do y'all know what the incident was with the US contractor that was killed?
03-01-2020T15:51:54,SageSaga,i cant find crap on it
03-01-2020T15:56:22,TeapotOfDoom,ok so nothing i haven't heard yet. good
03-01-2020T15:56:40,TeapotOfDoom,i was fearing the worst
03-01-2020T15:57:58,TeapotOfDoom,"trump is just the worst. peace by force. with our conidtions attached to it. if you don't want to, we'll give you some freedom"
03-01-2020T15:58:14,TeapotOfDoom,"sounds just like the perfect plan, doesn't it"
03-01-2020T15:58:47,TeapotOfDoom,sry got a bit political there
03-01-2020T15:58:55,CrimsonQuill,I'll be honest
03-01-2020T15:59:01,CrimsonQuill,I want to give up on politics
03-01-2020T15:59:13,CrimsonQuill,I don't trust any bugger further than I can throw them
03-01-2020T15:59:18,CrimsonQuill,Except maybe Rory Steward
03-01-2020T15:59:21,CrimsonQuill,Stewart
03-01-2020T15:59:21,TeapotOfDoom,i have hope in ours. not much but it's there
03-01-2020T15:59:41,TeapotOfDoom,stream is kil

03-01-2020T16:04:18,SageSaga,im getting some kinda drop in my upload speed
03-01-2020T16:04:32,SageSaga,it might clear up- it might get worse
03-01-2020T16:04:39,CrimsonQuill,"I haven't noticed anything...then again, I keep pausing and unpausing it"
03-01-2020T16:08:51,TeapotOfDoom,maybe someone else bloating the link
03-01-2020T16:13:46,Ordithus,at least the flash player is working for me
03-01-2020T16:18:02,TeapotOfDoom,flash player?
03-01-2020T16:18:38,Ordithus,"""RTMP Flash"" under tech in the settings.  HLS and MP4 are sometimes spotty"
03-01-2020T16:19:11,SageSaga,but Flash is... flash
03-01-2020T16:19:25,TeapotOfDoom,isn't flash being shut down this year?
03-01-2020T16:19:31,Ordithus,Working better than the others right now :P
