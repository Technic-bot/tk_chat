17-09-2020T00:33:00,SpazztasticKiwi,would Nora mimic a squirrel to pull a nib nab on Trace
17-09-2020T01:36:52,Dadrobit,"Honestly, I can almost see an appeal. It would be an extremely complex flavor combination for sure, and I wouldn't use plain yellow. But I'd give it a shot."
17-09-2020T01:48:03,SpazztasticKiwi,for a second I was thinking you were talking about Nora as a squirrel
17-09-2020T01:48:20,SpazztasticKiwi,also do you do costumes for oreo
17-09-2020T01:49:47,Dadrobit,Not really beyond bandanas
17-09-2020T01:53:56,SpazztasticKiwi,lil bowties
17-09-2020T01:54:18,SpazztasticKiwi,ive put hats on Bagheera
17-09-2020T01:54:27,SpazztasticKiwi,he‚Äôs not a fan but he tolerates it
17-09-2020T01:54:56,Dadrobit,Oreo hates anything near his head.
17-09-2020T01:59:17,SpazztasticKiwi,that‚Äôs kiwi
17-09-2020T01:59:43,SpazztasticKiwi,‚Äúwhat are you doing? what is that? get that away from me STAHP‚Äù
17-09-2020T02:00:37,Dadrobit,"He snuggles his head into me in the morning when I wake him up, but after that his head is forbidden territory."
17-09-2020T02:03:10,SpazztasticKiwi,you actually let him on the bed
17-09-2020T02:03:20,SpazztasticKiwi,aren‚Äôt people touchy about that with big dogs
17-09-2020T02:03:44,Dadrobit,"No, he doesn't get in my bed."
17-09-2020T02:04:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera headbutts me if he wants attention
17-09-2020T02:04:28,Dadrobit,"He has a crate to sleep in, and there is a cushion on the floor of my living room and another in my room."
17-09-2020T02:04:42,Dadrobit,A couch cushion.
17-09-2020T02:05:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Mark has about the same for chica
17-09-2020T02:05:15,Dadrobit,So he can hang out and relax in either place wherever I am.
17-09-2020T02:05:20,SpazztasticKiwi,he says she doesn‚Äôt get in the bed cause her panting shakes the bed
17-09-2020T02:06:04,Dadrobit,"Oreo knows not to get up on anything, couch or bed."
17-09-2020T02:06:06,SpazztasticKiwi,pets in bed aren‚Äôt bad to me but there‚Äôs some that just need a floor bed
17-09-2020T02:06:20,SpazztasticKiwi,‚Äúit‚Äôs bad for their joints‚Äù ‚Äúit‚Äôs unsanitary‚Äù ‚Äúit‚Äôs uncomfortable‚Äù
17-09-2020T02:06:35,Dadrobit,"It's not that he's too big, just that I am acutely aware of how dirty he is."
17-09-2020T02:06:42,SpazztasticKiwi,usually what you can hear from those that dont like or do it
17-09-2020T02:07:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera likes my pillow and kiwi does too - it can be a problem when everyone wants the pillow on a single night
17-09-2020T02:07:58,SpazztasticKiwi,I get to sleep in the middle
17-09-2020T02:08:25,SpazztasticKiwi,but kiwi prefers the living room for some reason if she doesn‚Äôt sleep on my pillow or at the foot of the bed
17-09-2020T02:09:30,SpazztasticKiwi,my only real issue is his grooming - there‚Äôs not a cat on this planet that grooms like he does
17-09-2020T02:09:42,SpazztasticKiwi,"if you poke him, he‚Äôs gotta clean the cooties"
17-09-2020T02:26:06,SpazztasticKiwi,have you seen the ads for mr squatch soap
17-09-2020T02:26:30,Dadrobit,Yeah
17-09-2020T02:26:48,Dadrobit,"They're funny, but kinda bullshit."
17-09-2020T02:27:45,SpazztasticKiwi,why do they radiate like old spice commercials
17-09-2020T02:27:55,SpazztasticKiwi,and why haven‚Äôt I seen it in stores
17-09-2020T02:28:49,Dadrobit,"Afaik it's an online only subscription model thing, like dollar shave club."
17-09-2020T02:29:45,SpazztasticKiwi,yeah I‚Äôm looking at that now
17-09-2020T02:29:57,Dadrobit,But the marketing is similar because it is. It's a visible dude just talking to the consumer. Most are you see are B-Roll clips with narration of the product. Totally different vibes.
17-09-2020T02:30:04,SpazztasticKiwi,why I‚Äôm getting men‚Äôs soap ads is beyond me but their new scent
17-09-2020T02:30:10,SpazztasticKiwi,choccy milk
17-09-2020T02:30:11,Dadrobit,Most ads you see*
17-09-2020T02:30:47,SpazztasticKiwi,not a terrible proposition but then you realize
17-09-2020T02:31:05,SpazztasticKiwi,there‚Äôs guys that want to smell like chocolate dairy?
17-09-2020T02:31:32,SpazztasticKiwi,the axe dark temptations may be dark chocolate but....chocolate milk?
17-09-2020T02:32:12,Dadrobit,"Like I said, the whole thing is just silly bullshit."

17-09-2020T02:34:34,SpazztasticKiwi,isn‚Äôt that advertising in a nutshell?
17-09-2020T02:34:55,Dadrobit,Hostile advertising I s'pose.
17-09-2020T02:35:32,Dadrobit,"Also, just bullshit. I want detergent properties in my soap."
17-09-2020T02:35:51,SpazztasticKiwi,gotta blast all the man nasty off?
17-09-2020T02:36:21,Dadrobit,Detergent is the stuff in soap that grabs onto dirt and grime.
17-09-2020T02:36:47,SpazztasticKiwi,skin detergent: bar soap

17-09-2020T12:53:02,AspiringNoodle,"Honestly, I'm on board with it being banned.  Anonymous themselves said to get rid of that spyware"
17-09-2020T12:53:17,AspiringNoodle,And they are typically AGAINST big corporations / government
17-09-2020T12:53:35,Xexanoth,"the problem is of course that it's CHINESE spyware, and not the god old US of A spyware"
17-09-2020T12:55:32,TerraTheWizard,like facebook

17-09-2020T12:56:16,AspiringNoodle,"Lol, but that's why so many people are jumping ship from those big platforms"
17-09-2020T12:56:30,Xexanoth,yeah but zoom is currently to useful to say anything
17-09-2020T12:56:52,JojoGD,im having a zoom class meeting right now
17-09-2020T12:56:53,Xexanoth,kinda hard to ban zoom when your education system and your corporate overlords currently depend on it
17-09-2020T12:57:06,TerraTheWizard,zoom is so hecking shady

17-09-2020T12:59:23,AspiringNoodle,What the hecc do they have to hide?
17-09-2020T12:59:42,JojoGD,also your basically teaching yourself
17-09-2020T12:59:44,AspiringNoodle,Is it possible they're pushing political agendas on their kids instead of core subjects?
17-09-2020T13:00:16,Xexanoth,"Also Terra, Zoom didn't come out of nowhere, it's been around for awhile as a ""pay only"" service, the change was that they made it free to use"

17-09-2020T20:16:57,BadFoMo,Picarto...
17-09-2020T20:17:04,Ordithus,could try a lower bitrate?
17-09-2020T20:17:04,SageSaga,its probably a connection between you and the picarto servers

17-09-2020T20:18:28,NezumiYuki,We jokingly said it was probably Kat's messing around with the ethernet cabling that was the problem.  xD

17-09-2020T20:18:44,Twokinds,It's going down to <1000 kb/s at times. I tried lowering the bitrate a tad but there's not much else I can do.
17-09-2020T20:18:50,NezumiYuki,Nah Picarto is never to blame... never....

17-09-2020T20:38:13,BlackjackSec99,thats a nice suit and tie
17-09-2020T20:38:17,NezumiYuki,Trace Legacy:  My life as a Keidran loving Grand Tempar....

17-09-2020T20:39:29,NezumiYuki,Well now!  That's a rather Military looking uniform!
17-09-2020T20:39:46,CrRAR,t-trenchcoat incoming?
17-09-2020T20:39:52,NezumiYuki,maybe?
17-09-2020T20:40:14,CrRAR,yes he must look the part directing the forces of the damned
17-09-2020T20:40:16,BADBackgroundProductions,A side by side comparison of Tom and Mark. On one side you have Tom hanging on and having a good time with the Twokinds crew and on the other you have Mark about to be killed by the FNAF crew
17-09-2020T20:40:21,BadFoMo,@BADBackgroundProductions Original pregnant Fem-Mike stuff?
17-09-2020T20:41:24,CrRAR,I feel like with that staff there kinda drawn in he's liable to break out into evil song-and-dance
17-09-2020T20:41:48,ContagiousBordem16,"Lol. Toms the king of TwoKinds, and Mark is THe kInG Of FiVe NIghtS At FrEDdyS"
17-09-2020T20:41:51,NezumiYuki,Oh speaking of Femme Mike... Did I ever show this?

17-09-2020T20:42:15,Ordithus,"Yuki, please describe the link when you drop it"

17-09-2020T20:43:27,Stormagedon,"did the same actor play in that one... hold on, must google"
17-09-2020T20:43:42,Dragusthor,constantine of dc comic?
17-09-2020T20:43:45,NezumiYuki,I never thought that Keanu Reeves as an American Constantine would have worked so well considering Constantine is british?
17-09-2020T20:43:47,CrRAR,it's Keanu and Tilda Swinton
17-09-2020T20:43:52,BADBackgroundProductions,I once had the idea that there should be a fan game where Mark meets the Twokinds crew but he has so much FNAF PTSD that he thinks they are all animatronics and Tom can‚Äôt convince him otherwise
17-09-2020T20:44:11,ContagiousBordem16,Kinda looks like he gonna go venture with Eggsy
17-09-2020T20:44:14,Ordithus,pfft
17-09-2020T20:44:18,Stormagedon,"Yah Drag, I like the actor they got for DC's legends of tomorrow"
17-09-2020T20:44:54,Stormagedon,"Names Matt Ryan, Does a very good job"
17-09-2020T20:44:55,Dragusthor,yeah!
17-09-2020T20:45:01,BADBackgroundProductions,"Oh wait, is this gangster Trace and gangster Flora?"

17-09-2020T20:45:41,BADBackgroundProductions,Watching Good Fellas so the thought entered my mind

17-09-2020T20:45:58,Dragusthor,trace y nora version g√°ngster?
17-09-2020T20:46:15,NezumiYuki,So then I'm guessing that's a Browning Automatic Rifle Trace is holding?
17-09-2020T20:46:32,BADBackgroundProductions,I thought it was supposed to be Tiger Trace tho
17-09-2020T20:46:35,CrimsonHelsing,"It's just a staff, a walking stick"
17-09-2020T20:46:37,ContagiousBordem16,PatchFace. Staring Trace Legacy

17-09-2020T20:48:07,Stormagedon,"Hello Mihari, didn't know you were here. How are you tonight!"
17-09-2020T20:48:50,Dragusthor,dracula does not use a staff at least if he pretends to be weak to catch prey.
17-09-2020T20:49:01,Dragusthor,I believe
17-09-2020T20:49:06,CrRAR,Flora's gonna be like the seductress with a look that could kill~
17-09-2020T20:49:17,CrRAR,(and maybe a sharp knife)

17-09-2020T21:19:58,Twokinds,I liked both. I definitely liked the Cinematography of 1.
17-09-2020T21:20:04,NezumiYuki,Ahh!
17-09-2020T21:20:08,Twokinds,"2 was way more action than the first, but was good too."

17-09-2020T21:20:38,BADBackgroundProductions,I LOVE the original Alien! That film is masterpiece!

17-09-2020T21:20:43,CrimsonHelsing,"Ugh, xenomorphs... But I like the second one more personally. Colonial Marines kicking sum a**!"
17-09-2020T21:20:49,Dragusthor,the first was the scariest
17-09-2020T21:21:09,Twokinds,I think the effects hold up really well
17-09-2020T21:21:25,Dragusthor,why are they called xenomorphs?
17-09-2020T21:21:39,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah its nice seeing non-cgi effects

17-09-2020T21:21:48,CrRAR,well they take the form of their host kinda
17-09-2020T21:21:49,CrimsonHelsing,Because that makes them distinct from other alien species?

17-09-2020T22:28:25,NezumiYuki,"@BadBG   well that could either be sunset showing through the window, or it could be a redish neon sign?   *shrugs*"
17-09-2020T22:28:49,SageSaga,yeah its pretty nuts when that happens Tom- you could stop the stream and start it again and we should see a current image- but yeeeeeah it would miss all the changes of course

17-09-2020T22:51:06,KeefMcDerpface,lol
17-09-2020T22:51:06,SageSaga,which caused a massive drop in frames without the lose in timing- which means it multiplied the time in the form of a delay
17-09-2020T22:51:12,SpazztasticKiwi,picarto uses spspspsps
17-09-2020T22:51:20,jirka,Rridey? It's Saturday

17-09-2020T22:52:59,SageSaga,thus after about an hour of drawing he just stopped and it took almost 2 hours to catch up
17-09-2020T22:53:00,SpazztasticKiwi,isn‚Äôt the green stuff supposed to slow you down
17-09-2020T22:53:31,BadFoMo,Isn't that what was happening?
17-09-2020T22:54:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"speaking of, there‚Äôs hemp stuff at my walmart - I have the scrub but the bar soap smells better"

17-09-2020T23:09:49,ZoieFalcona,that it has...
17-09-2020T23:10:38,SageSaga,Eric- you can post links so long as they are SFW and you say what they are before you post. Look at my link to the youtube video to see what i mean- i typed a description and then put the link
17-09-2020T23:10:54,eric190,gotcha. here's the pic then
17-09-2020T23:10:55,eric190,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/740794935543988286/754829243401371730/Eric_Request.png
17-09-2020T23:11:06,Nekonny,hope everything is going ok ^^
17-09-2020T23:11:10,SageSaga,=_=
17-09-2020T23:11:16,SageSaga,you failed so quickly
17-09-2020T23:11:32,SageSaga,why cant anyone just follow instructions-
17-09-2020T23:11:44,Nekonny,"well, he did say what it was"
17-09-2020T23:11:52,SpazztasticKiwi,to be a little fair he said what it was twice before
17-09-2020T23:11:57,Ordithus,"looks nice, for what it's worth!"
17-09-2020T23:11:59,SageSaga,it doesnt matter holy crap
17-09-2020T23:12:15,SageSaga,the whole point is to get people to follow the directions to know if they actually listen
17-09-2020T23:12:32,ZoieFalcona,I think Sage meant that he wants people to put a description first and then the link in the same post
17-09-2020T23:12:39,Nekonny,oh right
17-09-2020T23:12:42,Nekonny,my bad
17-09-2020T23:12:53,SageSaga,"and an actual description - not ""Here picture - Link"""
17-09-2020T23:13:15,SageSaga,"even something like ""A commission of my OC - link"""
17-09-2020T23:13:38,AspiringNoodle,"Ooooo, synth"
17-09-2020T23:14:11,eric190,i fully understand it now. wont mess it up again if i ever get anything else i'd like to share.
17-09-2020T23:14:19,SageSaga,ty
17-09-2020T23:14:43,SageSaga,thats all i want - if people mess up- i just want them to learn- not feel bad- just learn
17-09-2020T23:15:30,ZoieFalcona,and now I got an image of Link pushing a photograph into Zelda or Ganondorf's face  in full Hughes mode from Full Metal Alchemist
17-09-2020T23:15:59,SageSaga,this way when i see a link pop up while im working i can quickly tell what it is- if theres no description they dont know the rule or they are refusing to follow the rule- so i delete it usually
17-09-2020T23:16:02,AspiringNoodle,liiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiink
17-09-2020T23:16:08,SpazztasticKiwi,it does come off as slightly condescending at times

17-09-2020T23:18:05,eric190,"i'm a bit more used to streams where you directly ask to post, describing it there, then post after getting the OK."
17-09-2020T23:18:06,SageSaga,yeah im not great at being perfect nice person all the time
17-09-2020T23:18:20,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm rarely nice period

17-09-2020T23:19:32,SpazztasticKiwi,or rather day before yesterday - I had to shut down early cause the closer called in
17-09-2020T23:19:42,Ordithus,someone earlier said you were mean

17-09-2020T23:21:18,Ordithus,what even was that
17-09-2020T23:21:21,SpazztasticKiwi,"anyhoo, this lady wanted something cut and starts off with I‚Äôve been waiting ten minutes bull when I‚Äôd been on the phone for maybe 5-7 taking a cake order"

17-09-2020T23:21:52,SpazztasticKiwi,it took me longer to say I was shutting down early/could not put an out of order sign up than it was for her to leave
17-09-2020T23:21:55,ZRO4825,"Like, every video I clicked had me cracking up, and that's rare for me."
17-09-2020T23:22:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I repeated the same point at least 3 times

17-09-2020T23:23:23,SpazztasticKiwi,the closer called in so I MUST shut down early - yes that means the slicers are closed and no I cannot put a closed or out of order sign up because that‚Äôs higher up‚Äôs department

17-09-2020T23:24:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"the fact the lights were off, the slicers were cleaned covered and unplugged, & the scale was dark was apparently not enough of a hint - she needed, nay, Demanded a SIGN"
17-09-2020T23:24:41,AspiringNoodle,"They'll have multi-part orders, give you money at some point, and when everything's done, they argue with you over the total, as if the bill they gave you is in the system"
17-09-2020T23:24:49,SpazztasticKiwi,"I figured you had work or something keeping you from streams at times, zro"
17-09-2020T23:24:53,Dadrobit,Howdy y'all!

17-09-2020T23:26:27,Dadrobit,"Mmm, yeah, even I don't stream n drive at work whenever I need to do something in-person."

17-09-2020T23:27:11,Dadrobit,Yeah

17-09-2020T23:27:43,ZoieFalcona,"ahh, a competitor"
17-09-2020T23:28:04,Dadrobit,"Slight damage which I'm a bit miffed about, but it's not the end of the world."
17-09-2020T23:28:12,SpazztasticKiwi,closest one is over 50 miles
17-09-2020T23:28:22,SageSaga,who's a competitor?
17-09-2020T23:28:46,ZoieFalcona,Zro works for Dominos while Grey works for Marcos
17-09-2020T23:28:49,Dadrobit,Back cover was crimped on itself and one corner of a bunch of pages are dog eared.
17-09-2020T23:29:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve never heard of a Marcos
17-09-2020T23:29:12,Dadrobit,Never heard of a Marcos
17-09-2020T23:29:15,SageSaga,ouch wth
17-09-2020T23:29:21,SpazztasticKiwi,does it have a brother chain called polos?
17-09-2020T23:29:30,ZRO4825,"I don't consider the workers of other pizza places to be competitors, except in friendliness. I consider them brothers in arms in the battle against stupid customers."
17-09-2020T23:29:32,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
17-09-2020T23:29:32,SageSaga,is Marcos a local place?
17-09-2020T23:29:46,Dadrobit,Los Hermanos Polos?
17-09-2020T23:30:13,Dadrobit,(pretty sure that was the name)
17-09-2020T23:30:20,SpazztasticKiwi,"when in doubt, team up against stupidity"
17-09-2020T23:31:06,SageSaga,the only true enemy to Pizza is Papa Johns
17-09-2020T23:31:07,SpazztasticKiwi,it looks like Marcos is a ‚Äúnot from this side of the country‚Äù place
17-09-2020T23:31:26,AspiringNoodle,"Don't you guys love customers who ask, ""Do you have [insert product here]?"" That could be answered with even a modicum of effort?"
17-09-2020T23:31:33,SpazztasticKiwi,....I‚Äôve yet to have papa johns
17-09-2020T23:31:36,RimaDraws,back
17-09-2020T23:31:40,SpazztasticKiwi,or at least I don‚Äôt remember it
17-09-2020T23:31:41,RimaDraws,i finally finished that piece
17-09-2020T23:31:42,ZoieFalcona,"*moves over for Grey*  It's a 900 store chain that is in every state of the US, the Bahamas, India, and a few other nations."
17-09-2020T23:31:43,SageSaga,dont ever have it
17-09-2020T23:31:51,Dadrobit,Blegh. Papa John's is actually terrible. The pizza is worse than the box it comes in.
17-09-2020T23:31:59,SageSaga,never heard of it Zoie
17-09-2020T23:32:13,SpazztasticKiwi,dude I don‚Äôt even like pizza hit
17-09-2020T23:32:16,SpazztasticKiwi,hut
17-09-2020T23:32:25,AspiringNoodle,Actually can't remember the last time I had pizza that wasn't from a local joint
17-09-2020T23:32:36,AspiringNoodle,Pizza hut was maybe at the beginning of the year?
17-09-2020T23:32:42,AspiringNoodle,But hadn't been there in years before that
17-09-2020T23:33:04,SageSaga,"there are two ""nearby"" me but ive never heard of it before- and by nearby i mean  12-15 miles"
17-09-2020T23:33:32,SpazztasticKiwi,now who‚Äôs grey

17-09-2020T23:33:53,Ordithus,grats rima!
17-09-2020T23:33:54,ZRO4825,"I haven't heard of'em either, but considering I rarely leave my city (and never go looking for pizza anywhere else, lol), that's not saying much."
17-09-2020T23:33:58,RimaDraws,ty ord
17-09-2020T23:34:04,ZRO4825,She did a good too. :3
17-09-2020T23:34:13,SpazztasticKiwi,oooooooo I was thinking you were talking about someone who was grey
17-09-2020T23:34:14,SageSaga,if i could eat Pizza again i would go to Tony and Melienas and get their's because it tastes like your mouth is having an orgy of cheese and sauce
17-09-2020T23:34:16,ZoieFalcona,"anywho, no worries about that. I'll just hush about Grey's work."
17-09-2020T23:34:29,Dadrobit,"Can confirm, Rima is excellent"
17-09-2020T23:34:33,ZRO4825,"How's his knee, Zoie? iirc didn't he hurt it a while back?"
17-09-2020T23:34:46,RimaDraws,aw shucks
17-09-2020T23:34:48,SageSaga,you eat it and feel like God is judging you for your sinful act- and hes jealous
17-09-2020T23:34:55,RimaDraws,lol sage
17-09-2020T23:35:04,SpazztasticKiwi,I smell that you‚Äôre exaggerating
17-09-2020T23:35:16,Sclimshady,Nice work on that pic Rima
17-09-2020T23:35:18,ZRO4825,"Maybe, but if Sage is willing to wax that poetic about it, I'd be willing to try it. :P"
17-09-2020T23:35:26,ZoieFalcona,"tbh, I don't think Sage is exaggerating."
17-09-2020T23:35:39,RimaDraws,ty sclim
17-09-2020T23:36:32,Dadrobit,RIP pizza for folks with bad gerd....
17-09-2020T23:36:40,SageSaga,remember im also a man that can no longer eat pizza ever without intense pain and havent touched anything with tomato sauce in over 3 years
17-09-2020T23:37:00,ZoieFalcona,Sage needs a hug.. a long hug T.T

17-09-2020T23:37:37,SpazztasticKiwi,a cheesy garlic bread hug
17-09-2020T23:37:44,ZoieFalcona,this song sounds like  remixed song from ChronoCross
17-09-2020T23:37:45,Dadrobit,I need to get checked out again myself. Some red pepper hummus got my reflux acting up so bad I couldn't sleep all night.
17-09-2020T23:37:54,Dadrobit,Couple days back.
17-09-2020T23:38:09,SpazztasticKiwi,I sometimes wonder what I‚Äôll be like when I‚Äôm old
17-09-2020T23:38:17,SageSaga,Zoie- that's because it IS
17-09-2020T23:38:18,SpazztasticKiwi,then these conversations happen
17-09-2020T23:38:26,ZoieFalcona,the sad thing is that I can't eat cheese or I get massive migraines... I miss it
17-09-2020T23:38:30,ZoieFalcona,:D
17-09-2020T23:38:52,ZoieFalcona,I haven't picked that game up in I don't remember when but I still remembered!
17-09-2020T23:38:54,Dadrobit,"Hiatal hernia. Sucks dick, but doctor didn't think it was bad enough to warrant attention at the time."
17-09-2020T23:38:56,Ordithus,"had pizza tonight, was yum"
17-09-2020T23:38:58,ZRO4825,I don't think I could give up cheese. I'd probably starve. :rofl:
17-09-2020T23:39:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Jesus what made cheese start originating from satans basement
17-09-2020T23:39:04,RimaDraws,cheese gives me problems. i am kinda lactose intolerant
17-09-2020T23:39:10,RimaDraws,i still eatit
17-09-2020T23:39:31,ZoieFalcona,I still need to function somewhat as I teach kids for a living.
17-09-2020T23:40:01,SpazztasticKiwi,my dad had some sort of hernia before he died
17-09-2020T23:40:03,ZoieFalcona,"migraines around young, loud children SUCK"

17-09-2020T23:47:42,ZRO4825,"Apparently you did not, or if you did, it didn't get posted on FA~"
17-09-2020T23:48:17,ZoieFalcona,Nyna isn't flat by a longshot.
17-09-2020T23:48:18,ZRO4825,"Only ones I see on FA are one you did of Nyna in a tree, the one from Fluff, and a fanart by Nixieseal~"

17-09-2020T23:50:59,SpazztasticKiwi,then you must have a low threshold
17-09-2020T23:51:11,unsteddyphoenix,sage flexing on all us
17-09-2020T23:51:31,ZRO4825,"I prefer to consider myself focused. I ain't worried 'bout that normal horror stuff, but leave the boobies out alone. >:V"
