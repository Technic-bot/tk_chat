10-12-2020T00:02:37,SpazztasticKiwi,honestly one of those turbine toys that you see on toddler toys would probably entertain him
10-12-2020T00:02:40,CrRAR,:guitar::notes:
10-12-2020T00:03:06,CrRAR,Like the thing with the button that spins?
10-12-2020T00:03:21,CrRAR,or like those mini carousels?
10-12-2020T00:06:06,CrRAR,That just reminded me of a park thing somewhere that you would spin like a middle circle wheel and it would rotate the platform dealie.
10-12-2020T00:06:23,CrRAR,I guess kinda how those mad tea cup rides work.
10-12-2020T00:07:04,CrRAR,though now that I think of it I swear there was like a 'little tykes' at home version of that.
10-12-2020T00:10:04,CrRAR,Ah yes this freakin thing

10-12-2020T00:11:31,CrRAR,"18 months and up! Wow, sign me up!"
10-12-2020T00:11:41,CrRAR,fun for ALL ages
10-12-2020T00:12:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I had that
10-12-2020T00:12:08,SpazztasticKiwi,two at one point
10-12-2020T00:12:35,SpazztasticKiwi,bet talking a boat propeller thing
10-12-2020T00:12:44,SpazztasticKiwi,but
10-12-2020T00:12:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Im
10-12-2020T00:12:56,CrRAR,two!? That's maniacal.
10-12-2020T00:13:14,CrRAR,ah yeah I figured it was something different
10-12-2020T00:13:39,CrRAR,just went off into memory rabbitholes
10-12-2020T00:14:46,CrRAR,Wait is the boat propellor thing like a puzzle or just a 'fun' toy?
10-12-2020T00:14:51,SpazztasticKiwi,"also, there is a sugar cookie bomb"
10-12-2020T00:15:03,CrRAR,add it to the list!
10-12-2020T00:15:07,CrRAR,pronto
10-12-2020T00:15:16,SpazztasticKiwi,don’t like em
10-12-2020T00:15:36,CrRAR,Is it weird smelling?
10-12-2020T00:15:48,SpazztasticKiwi,not fond of gingerbread either but I figured it’d be ok
10-12-2020T00:15:57,CrRAR,"also, you got my hopes up"
10-12-2020T00:16:19,SpazztasticKiwi,yet I turned out liking the mulled wine when I thought it would be the bad one
10-12-2020T00:16:35,SpazztasticKiwi,and the snowflake and snowman shaped ones
10-12-2020T00:16:48,SpazztasticKiwi,evergreen & winter smells
10-12-2020T00:16:57,SpazztasticKiwi,v nice
10-12-2020T00:17:09,CrRAR,Are the cookie ones shaped like cookies? :thinking:
10-12-2020T00:17:19,SpazztasticKiwi,....maybe
10-12-2020T00:17:28,CrRAR,Yeah evergreen is amazing
10-12-2020T00:17:40,CrRAR,long as it's not overdone
10-12-2020T00:19:12,SpazztasticKiwi,you know you can get these things yourself too right
10-12-2020T00:19:53,CrRAR,"lol, I haven't taken a bath since like 4th grade"
10-12-2020T00:20:15,SpazztasticKiwi,the sugar cookie is seasonal but for some reason it’s no longer available for this year
10-12-2020T00:20:15,CrRAR,Though might be worth running one just for the gud scents
10-12-2020T00:20:28,CrRAR,damnnit
10-12-2020T00:20:46,CrRAR,too popular
10-12-2020T00:20:51,CrRAR,I bet
10-12-2020T00:20:58,SpazztasticKiwi,"if it was sold out, the picture and the add to cart button would be grey"
10-12-2020T00:21:03,SpazztasticKiwi,but it’s just gone
10-12-2020T00:21:07,SpazztasticKiwi,the candle too
10-12-2020T00:21:19,CrRAR,"stupid business logic, aww :c"
10-12-2020T00:21:27,SpazztasticKiwi,"which, you know they have candles too so the bath thing is no excuse"
10-12-2020T00:21:51,CrRAR,I kno :ptv-sad:
10-12-2020T00:23:03,CrRAR,"honestly, I srsly think I'll just bake some sugar cookies c:"
10-12-2020T00:23:11,CrRAR,...tomorrow
10-12-2020T00:23:33,CrRAR,or frikkin snickerdoodles
10-12-2020T00:23:42,SpazztasticKiwi,the drawback is they have rings even in the candles

10-12-2020T00:25:17,CrRAR,(wh)Ooo
10-12-2020T00:25:41,SpazztasticKiwi,there’s 4 dragon bombs too
10-12-2020T00:25:44,CrRAR,"The ring is kinda nice, the owl is... a bit scary"
10-12-2020T00:25:54,CrRAR,xD
10-12-2020T00:25:59,SpazztasticKiwi,"dragon, wicked dragon, snow dragon, & lucky dragon"
10-12-2020T00:26:13,SpazztasticKiwi,I have an owl ring
10-12-2020T00:26:30,CrRAR,It's pretty
10-12-2020T00:26:50,SpazztasticKiwi,not that owl ring
10-12-2020T00:26:58,SpazztasticKiwi,but a owl ring
10-12-2020T00:27:11,CrRAR,"Ah an ACTUAL owl, neat"
10-12-2020T00:28:02,CrRAR,Are the dragon ones like dragonfruit scented?
10-12-2020T00:28:18,SpazztasticKiwi,they’re different
10-12-2020T00:28:52,CrRAR,Dragonfruit and passionfruit are both confusing smells. Sweet berry-like I guess.

10-12-2020T00:30:12,SpazztasticKiwi,wicked dragon isn’t available for awhile again
10-12-2020T00:30:36,SpazztasticKiwi,but this is one of the themed collections that are sterling silver
10-12-2020T00:30:46,SpazztasticKiwi,...and $26 each
10-12-2020T00:31:08,CrRAR,def cool metalwork on the rings
10-12-2020T00:31:35,SpazztasticKiwi,the wicked dragon could definitely be a men’s ring
10-12-2020T00:31:35,CrRAR,yeah the scent ingredients on all those seem quite exotic~
10-12-2020T00:32:01,SpazztasticKiwi,its pretty much just a redo of the dragon bomb but in black and dark stones
10-12-2020T00:32:18,AspiringNoodle,"Mmmm, swedish fish~ *nom*"
10-12-2020T00:32:31,CrRAR,There is the one that's like no gem that kind of just looks like a coiled draggie.
10-12-2020T00:32:56,CrRAR,"Swedish fish, so indulgently sugary~"
10-12-2020T00:33:14,CrRAR,:cw0lfmare-BerninAngry::fish:
10-12-2020T00:34:01,CrRAR,Of course 2/3 are egg shaped. haha
10-12-2020T00:34:56,SpazztasticKiwi,they also had a death by chocolate collection
10-12-2020T00:38:09,CrRAR,"chocolate can be a weird one, appealing but only enjoyable so long."
10-12-2020T00:44:37,SpazztasticKiwi,related to the dragon collections is the rising phoenix  & phoenix reborn
10-12-2020T00:44:51,SpazztasticKiwi,the chocolate one was too weird to me
10-12-2020T00:46:47,CrRAR,It's amazing how many options they have
10-12-2020T00:47:29,CrRAR,"Yeah chocolate scents try to be indulgent, but probably turn ""rich"" into sickening."
10-12-2020T00:48:20,CrRAR,Chocolate one of those things not meant to be constantly tasted.
10-12-2020T00:48:36,CrRAR,or smelled
10-12-2020T00:51:42,SpazztasticKiwi,more like I don’t want to bathe in chocolate
10-12-2020T00:51:46,SpazztasticKiwi,even if it’s the smell
10-12-2020T00:52:02,CrRAR,"They got a 'get 'em tiger' one seems interesting, got bergamot, which is a citrus."
10-12-2020T00:52:23,CrRAR,It's the citrus that's in earl grey tea xD
10-12-2020T00:52:43,SpazztasticKiwi,these are the choices for rising pheonix https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/524825976597643265/786832674416623637/image0.jpg
10-12-2020T00:52:57,SpazztasticKiwi,yeah I mentioned the tiger one when they announced it
10-12-2020T00:53:14,CrRAR,"I don't really know what FRESH bergamot would be like, cuz earl grey is not orangy tasting by any means"
10-12-2020T00:53:22,CrRAR,oo
10-12-2020T00:53:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"some time before, I sent in a request that they partner with the big cat sanctuary for big cat conservation"
10-12-2020T00:53:58,CrRAR,Did you get a tiger one?
10-12-2020T00:54:26,SpazztasticKiwi,"like the snow and amur leopards, which are both have under ~1000 alive"
10-12-2020T00:54:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I bough 2
10-12-2020T00:54:49,CrRAR,did you like it?
10-12-2020T00:55:07,CrRAR,was it citrusy?
10-12-2020T00:55:32,CrRAR,"yeah, gotta save the kitties"
10-12-2020T00:55:41,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-maevecute:
10-12-2020T00:55:59,SpazztasticKiwi,they partnered with The Phoenix Fund and Greater Good Charities for go get em tiger
10-12-2020T00:56:38,CrRAR,Yeah I saw the phoenix banner thing :revolving_hearts:
10-12-2020T00:56:49,SpazztasticKiwi,for the amur leopard and tiger but it says they conserve for all endangered big cats
10-12-2020T00:56:53,SpazztasticKiwi,close enough
10-12-2020T00:57:02,SpazztasticKiwi,they smells good
10-12-2020T00:57:10,CrRAR,ah nice
10-12-2020T01:00:29,CrRAR,"Yeah, preserving habitats is probably the biggest part of that"
10-12-2020T01:00:35,CrRAR,and poachers
10-12-2020T01:00:42,CrRAR,stopping them
10-12-2020T01:01:44,CrRAR,gotta give those regions more productive outlets to be prosperous
10-12-2020T01:02:31,CrRAR,"though, I guess it's really rich jerks demand for rare furs or whatever that creates the market."
10-12-2020T01:03:00,CrRAR,difficult problems
10-12-2020T01:04:36,SpazztasticKiwi,spent maybe 2 hours sitting there last night
10-12-2020T01:04:49,SpazztasticKiwi,used 2 bombs
10-12-2020T01:06:02,SpazztasticKiwi,https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/524825976597643265/786835936221724687/image0.jpg got the middle opal on the ring finger
10-12-2020T01:06:26,SpazztasticKiwi,the picture doesn’t do the sparkle justice
10-12-2020T01:06:42,CrRAR,"nope, never does"
10-12-2020T01:06:53,CrRAR,the teardrop shapy one?
10-12-2020T01:07:12,SpazztasticKiwi,they look like rainbows living in white
10-12-2020T01:07:22,CrRAR,pretty
10-12-2020T01:07:27,SpazztasticKiwi,cracks of rainbows shining through white
10-12-2020T01:07:33,SpazztasticKiwi,yeah the teardrop
10-12-2020T01:07:54,SpazztasticKiwi,there’s 3 teardrop/pears
10-12-2020T01:08:20,CrRAR,oh yeah it even has the two flanking stones there
10-12-2020T01:08:32,SpazztasticKiwi,I wanted the heart but I got the heart cut with the emerald birthstone candle
10-12-2020T01:08:42,CrRAR,"are those just crystal tho, they contrast well"
10-12-2020T01:08:58,CrRAR,ah yeah
10-12-2020T01:09:50,CrRAR,I think out of all of em that teardrop one is nice cuz
10-12-2020T01:10:14,CrRAR,just seems like a thoughtful design w/ the stones
10-12-2020T01:11:19,CrRAR,heart on is more sleek tho
10-12-2020T01:11:28,CrRAR,*one
10-12-2020T01:11:39,SpazztasticKiwi,"all the birthstone rings are the same cuts and designs, they just have different center stones"

10-12-2020T01:12:35,SpazztasticKiwi,emerald (may) birthstone collection - I got the heart cut
10-12-2020T01:12:53,SpazztasticKiwi,the white bg helps noone
10-12-2020T01:13:13,CrRAR,"Nah, it don't"
10-12-2020T01:13:20,CrRAR,pretty

10-12-2020T01:13:36,CrRAR,:sparkles:
10-12-2020T01:14:05,CrRAR,"but yeah the opal one ya got is like kinda british royalty looking, I feel like."
10-12-2020T01:14:18,CrRAR,like more regal styling
10-12-2020T01:14:54,Dadrobit,Howdy y'all.
10-12-2020T01:14:57,SpazztasticKiwi,shiny make bird brain go ooo
10-12-2020T01:14:59,CrRAR,"simple, but bold"
10-12-2020T01:15:10,CrRAR,heyo daddio!
10-12-2020T01:15:31,CrRAR,any Cyberpunk playtime yet?
10-12-2020T01:15:46,Dadrobit,"Yeah, couple hours yesterday."
10-12-2020T01:15:54,SpazztasticKiwi,"yeah it’s not the one I wanted most but they were all plenty good to get, whichever I ended up with"
10-12-2020T01:16:26,Dadrobit,"It's stretches of really strong fun, interspersed with literally game breaking bugs...."
10-12-2020T01:16:26,CrRAR,yus
10-12-2020T01:16:38,SpazztasticKiwi,some of the designs could pass as engagement or wedding rings
10-12-2020T01:16:56,CrRAR,yeah I heard the bugginess out of the reviews rumors
10-12-2020T01:17:00,CrRAR,That sucks
10-12-2020T01:17:12,CrRAR,Kinda hope that they patch then
10-12-2020T01:17:24,Dadrobit,Had three occasions so far that just needed to be reloaded. And a clue stupid death bugs.
10-12-2020T01:17:32,Dadrobit,A couple*
10-12-2020T01:17:38,CrRAR,Yeah it is funny how nuanced ring designs can be
10-12-2020T01:17:50,CrRAR,weird
10-12-2020T01:18:03,Dadrobit,climbs fence and is thrown 200 feet backwards off a cliff to his death.
10-12-2020T01:18:03,SpazztasticKiwi,so the games out but still has notable bugs
10-12-2020T01:18:14,Dadrobit,Stuff like that
10-12-2020T01:18:22,SpazztasticKiwi,testers note: found a bug
10-12-2020T01:18:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"a tiny one, really"
10-12-2020T01:18:46,Dadrobit,And my hair keeps disappearing...
10-12-2020T01:19:07,CrRAR,:beetle::ptv-excited:
10-12-2020T01:19:21,SpazztasticKiwi,they’re giving you a look at yourself forward and backward through time
10-12-2020T01:19:44,CrRAR,"lol robot, sounds like a personal problem"
10-12-2020T01:19:49,Dadrobit,I don't think tits are in my future tbqh
10-12-2020T01:19:59,SpazztasticKiwi,oh and I take it this means you found another name to call yourself too
10-12-2020T01:20:21,SpazztasticKiwi,or there’s a body in the basement
10-12-2020T01:20:26,Dadrobit,"Nope, just didn't sign in to their services."
10-12-2020T01:20:59,SpazztasticKiwi,don’t say that - you’ll end up single forever
10-12-2020T01:22:07,CrRAR,"yeah, I got it downloaded haven't played it yet, might wait for at least some news about big fixin then."
10-12-2020T01:22:17,Dadrobit,"I mean, maybe I'll get with someone who's had a bilateral mastectomy?"
10-12-2020T01:22:21,CrRAR,big/bug w/e
10-12-2020T01:23:41,CrRAR,so many p o s s i b i i I t i e s
10-12-2020T01:23:45,Dadrobit,"I don't judge much. I'm a guy, the most important thing we look for is a pulse. Pretty much everything else is just a bonus."
10-12-2020T01:24:18,Dadrobit,"RAR, it's still fun, I just learned to start saving often lol."
10-12-2020T01:24:21,CrRAR,"hehehe, so inspiring"
10-12-2020T01:24:28,CrRAR,:ptv-unimpressed:
10-12-2020T01:24:38,CrRAR,oh good
10-12-2020T01:24:49,CrRAR,"Save early, save often"
10-12-2020T01:26:04,Dadrobit,"Oh, well. Theft mechanics are kinda dumb. You can take items from anywhere at any time. Except for the one or two times you can't and suddenly everyone's shooting at you with no indication beforehand that you're doing a  no-no."
10-12-2020T01:26:30,CrRAR,"Yeah I mean GTA had those bugs where you could get flung by geometry anomolies , but like they were so rare."
10-12-2020T01:27:29,CrRAR,ah weird
10-12-2020T01:27:46,Dadrobit,Inside a base full of psychopath enemies that are temporarily not shooting you? Take everything. In a hotel with the concierge offering you a night? Don't you fuckin dare touch that datapad.
10-12-2020T01:28:12,CrRAR,is detection stealth based? or what?
10-12-2020T01:28:46,Dadrobit,"Yeah, it has stealth mechanics. But for taking stuff, you can literally take anything anywhere in broad daylight."
10-12-2020T01:29:23,Dadrobit,"But there's like one or two places that are just like, naw dawg, you're dead now."
10-12-2020T01:29:38,CrRAR,haha wow
10-12-2020T01:30:00,Dadrobit,And there's no distinction between theft and simply picking stuff up.
10-12-2020T01:30:07,CrRAR,"yeah, that just sounds like oversight/lack of polish"
10-12-2020T01:30:51,Dadrobit,The UI/UX of the looting pop-up is a nightmare because it's all deep red text. Which in any other game is an indication of theft.
10-12-2020T01:31:07,CrRAR,"when it's uniformity it's probably cuz no one had time to stop mid-design and be like ""does this make sense""?"
10-12-2020T01:31:09,Dadrobit,But in CP2077 it's just... Because...
10-12-2020T01:31:39,SpazztasticKiwi,"like I said, I’ve heard that before"
10-12-2020T01:31:49,CrRAR,"yeahhh, sounds like some design cues skipped some review steps... or several"
10-12-2020T01:32:13,SpazztasticKiwi,I just did 3 German lesson with no mistakes
10-12-2020T01:32:28,Dadrobit,"Still not met Keanu Reeves yet, but it is still pretty solid besides."
10-12-2020T01:32:37,CrRAR,wunderbar!

10-12-2020T01:33:12,CrRAR,yeah gotta build up to that
10-12-2020T01:33:26,Dadrobit,I'm pretty sure I'm on the mission that puts him in the game.
10-12-2020T01:34:42,CrRAR,german is an interesting language because word structure literally becomes a string of descriptions.
10-12-2020T01:34:55,CrRAR,like sentence-words
10-12-2020T01:35:00,Dadrobit,"I'm pretty excited, because the game has already opened up the world to me kind of in the same way The Witcher 3 has its own giant tutorial area, and I'm not even close to completing this one yet with a majority of the city still locked out."
10-12-2020T01:35:06,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s a smol whoohoo but all it is review
10-12-2020T01:36:10,Dadrobit,"I think it's kinda like Skyrim back when it launched on PS3. Shit bugs, but ultimately a good time."
10-12-2020T01:36:22,CrRAR,"I guess that what makes german more able to be ""throaty"" cuz words are easier expressed as a sound if they're just a kludge of things."
10-12-2020T01:36:48,SpazztasticKiwi,it does show that those lesson steps are pretty well covered
10-12-2020T01:37:08,CrRAR,Silly other languages with their many PUNY worrdsss.

10-12-2020T01:59:11,CrRAR,hmmm
10-12-2020T01:59:16,Dadrobit,We used to make our own as a kid.
10-12-2020T01:59:19,SpazztasticKiwi,half because he doesn’t chew and half because he seemed confused what to do with a stick of meat
10-12-2020T01:59:38,Dadrobit,Was a fun family project.
10-12-2020T01:59:41,CrRAR,yeah I could see the texture being a problem

10-12-2020T02:13:07,SpazztasticKiwi,can’t dogs and cats get salmonella too
10-12-2020T02:13:34,Dadrobit,Wash your eggs. Salmonella is on the outside.
10-12-2020T02:14:15,Dadrobit,"Also, it's super duper incredibly rare in the US because all the store bought have to be cleaned before they're sold."
10-12-2020T02:15:10,Dadrobit,"It's why they have a shorter shelf life in the US, cuz the protective layer they have on the outside is washed off."
10-12-2020T02:15:42,SpazztasticKiwi,it can be present instead and outside
10-12-2020T02:16:07,Dadrobit,"But is give n take. Short shelf life, but no death by pooping yourself.death"
10-12-2020T02:16:15,Dadrobit,To death*
10-12-2020T02:16:43,SpazztasticKiwi,most people argue now that salmonella isn’t in eggs now because of the industrialization of it
10-12-2020T02:17:41,SpazztasticKiwi,you see the lady that made a crock meal topper for her dogs
10-12-2020T02:18:24,Dadrobit,"One sec, bbl, boss here!"

10-12-2020T17:45:25,Rainelover,Hello Tom!
10-12-2020T17:45:27,CrRAR,secret to everybody!
10-12-2020T17:45:37,MisterWho,As that iOS update which makes you iPhone waterproof...and the ppl really tried it!
10-12-2020T17:45:44,pretorian,It's surprisingly hard to kill GPU with water https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJUl_IqDbNA
10-12-2020T17:46:15,CrRAR,If it’s off with no residual electricity
10-12-2020T17:46:30,pretorian,on that video it's on use

10-12-2020T17:46:42,Rainelover,"Wow, so maybe Laura really DOES know what she’s doing..."
10-12-2020T17:46:52,CrRAR,in fact distilled water is actually not conductive
10-12-2020T17:47:05,MisterWho,for a short time
10-12-2020T17:47:08,SpazztasticKiwi,normally I don’t give too much on my suggestion but this time I layed out what I had in mind
10-12-2020T17:47:11,CrRAR,Only when there is dissolved things in water does it become conductive
10-12-2020T17:47:20,CrRAR,Like that’s why salt water is MORE conductive
10-12-2020T17:47:28,MisterWho,distilled water like to grab every ion it can get
10-12-2020T17:47:29,SpazztasticKiwi,...except for the pose....hold on
10-12-2020T17:47:31,NezumiYuki,It's all about the ions
10-12-2020T17:47:39,CrRAR,But yeah it’s tough to keep water pure long enough to keep it NOT conductive
10-12-2020T17:47:52,CrRAR,Yeah it would quickly become conductive
10-12-2020T17:48:02,MisterWho,IPA would be better for a GPU cleaning
10-12-2020T17:48:15,CrRAR,Mineral oil!
10-12-2020T17:48:19,MisterWho,ewwwww
10-12-2020T17:48:22,SpazztasticKiwi,is there a name for that pose couples do with the guys arm over the wife’s shoulder
10-12-2020T17:48:22,MisterWho,what a mess!
10-12-2020T17:48:31,CrRAR,There were PC enthusiasts that made PC’s submerged in mineral olis
10-12-2020T17:48:42,MisterWho,"i know, i've seen em."
10-12-2020T17:48:57,CrRAR,Look up ReactorPC they were a boutique builder that made OEM designs like fishtank PCs
10-12-2020T17:49:02,CrRAR,Small form factor though
10-12-2020T17:49:13,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve seen some of the stuff on people’s computers
10-12-2020T17:49:13,NezumiYuki,"Yes true because oddly enough, highly purified water by it's very nature wants to strip ions from anything around it... so while pure water isn't conductive, given a minute or two, it'll leech strip metals and in an effort to balance itself out.   Which i"
10-12-2020T17:49:15,CrRAR,Horrible business model as they aren’t quite... servicable
10-12-2020T17:49:21,NezumiYuki,Which is frightening!
10-12-2020T17:49:22,SpazztasticKiwi,you wash that gpu in holy water

10-12-2020T17:50:21,SpazztasticKiwi,"if Nora blessed water, would it just turn black or become an aphrodisiac"

10-12-2020T17:50:57,NezumiYuki,I forgot to book mark that youtube...
10-12-2020T17:52:08,NezumiYuki,Nora's blessed water would indeed be an aphrodisiac!  xDD
10-12-2020T17:52:12,CrRAR,Nora would just bless a whole hot spring or something
10-12-2020T17:52:21,NezumiYuki,Yeah she would
10-12-2020T17:52:23,NezumiYuki,xD

10-12-2020T17:55:12,CrRAR,Might actually explain the real story behind that old minikind where someone touched water > got boobs
10-12-2020T17:55:44,NezumiYuki,Ahhhh!
10-12-2020T17:55:50,CrRAR,It might have been an incentive
10-12-2020T17:55:53,CrRAR,:thinking:
10-12-2020T17:56:00,CrRAR,It was REALLY long ago
10-12-2020T17:56:10,CrRAR,It was animated... slightly
10-12-2020T17:56:12,MisterWho,"Ohhh, what minikind?"
10-12-2020T17:56:33,CrRAR,I wonder if that was one of the first bwoms?
10-12-2020T17:56:45,NezumiYuki,"I really wish Nora's magical floating hot spring existed... If I could find it, I'd bottle some of that water for myself and others, right after I took a dip in it! <3"

10-12-2020T17:58:51,Rainelover,The question is are you desperate enough to use the boob water on your GPU and risk it growing boobs?
10-12-2020T17:59:17,NezumiYuki,well
10-12-2020T17:59:32,NezumiYuki,it's certain enhance any giggle physics in games

10-12-2020T18:05:09,NezumiYuki,Hmmm sounds awesome!  >:3
10-12-2020T18:05:36,SpazztasticKiwi,where is this hot spring that gives extra boob
10-12-2020T18:05:47,NezumiYuki,Well I'd sure like to know!
10-12-2020T18:05:48,SpazztasticKiwi,I have important research

10-12-2020T18:06:19,NezumiYuki,"OH that... LOL well this idea of ours certainly isn't new, but the most iconic regarding hot-springs would be Ranma 1/2"

10-12-2020T18:08:27,SpazztasticKiwi,how about a plastic surgery spring
10-12-2020T18:08:48,SpazztasticKiwi,if you could just move the jiggle up a bit....
10-12-2020T18:09:22,MisterWho,noonononononono XD
10-12-2020T18:09:43,MisterWho,A splashbomb into the spring and the outcome...
10-12-2020T18:10:20,SpazztasticKiwi,one frat guy type decides to cannonball to soak everyone around not knowing what the spring can do
10-12-2020T18:10:36,SpazztasticKiwi,ends up with huge hongongabongonaloos
10-12-2020T18:10:57,SpazztasticKiwi,and an angry mob of boobified victims

10-12-2020T18:27:04,NezumiYuki,Yep xDD
10-12-2020T18:28:19,NinoGD,...
10-12-2020T18:28:39,NezumiYuki,"Funny enough... Hentai literally applies to that anime... with hentai meaning Strange, perverted, and weird in the literal sense."
10-12-2020T18:29:00,NezumiYuki,"Ero manga and anime is just that, erotica. Nothing strange about that."

10-12-2020T20:24:06,Dadrobit,[06:02:16] <Tom> Laura x Keith is lesbians.
10-12-2020T20:24:16,Dadrobit,[06:02:46] <Tom> Because Keith is a girl.

10-12-2020T20:31:39,Dadrobit,[06:06:52] <Tom> Alaric is actually the only one who's found out Keith's true gender.
10-12-2020T20:31:45,Dadrobit,[06:07:12] <Tom> So he's actually completely heterosexual.

10-12-2020T20:34:16,Ordithus,think he would know he's a boy
10-12-2020T20:34:21,Ordithus,or not
10-12-2020T20:34:54,Dadrobit,"[06:07:56] <Tom> Also, Keith's father knew, which was why he was never happy with Keith. So he raised Keith as a boy."

10-12-2020T20:35:06,Dadrobit,"He was raised as one, he doesn't know the difference."
10-12-2020T20:36:01,Dadrobit,"That's why when Natani came into the baths with Keith, he said, ""Don't make me show you the difference"". Because he didn't know himeself."

10-12-2020T23:26:29,SageSaga,"things like- plastic bags as clothes- weird out there ""fashion"" i have no interest in"
10-12-2020T23:26:43,SageSaga,but even then im generally not gonna hate it
10-12-2020T23:26:45,NezumiYuki,"Ah okay yeah, that I can see and agree with.  xD"
10-12-2020T23:27:06,ChromaticBard,Hello!
10-12-2020T23:27:10,MoonDance,Yeah the trash as fashion is a really weird one
10-12-2020T23:27:13,NezumiYuki,Hey Bard
10-12-2020T23:27:17,KeefMcDerpface,hello Bard
10-12-2020T23:27:28,Kiwipower,Hello Bard
10-12-2020T23:27:30,Twokinds,I don't like stuff that's tacky or trashy
10-12-2020T23:27:35,KeefMcDerpface,Noted
10-12-2020T23:28:11,SageSaga,depending on the definition used for Trashy- i like some trashy outfits XD
10-12-2020T23:28:11,Kiwipower,@Twokinds What about dollar store clothes? XD
10-12-2020T23:28:22,KeefMcDerpface,"I say that, and I don't know what you consider tacky or trashy."
10-12-2020T23:29:02,MoonDance,I think the one fashion trend I really don't like is like a recent one. One were chicks where super short shorts and a super long shirt. I can't remember what they were called
10-12-2020T23:29:22,Kiwipower,Karen’s?
10-12-2020T23:29:29,KeefMcDerpface,hah!
10-12-2020T23:29:36,MoonDance,oh vsco girls! Yeah I don't like
10-12-2020T23:29:42,SageSaga,i try not to judge someone by their outfit- unless their outfit says something in a factual sense to judge them by XD
10-12-2020T23:30:10,SageSaga,"like how- if someone is wearing a ""im with stupid"" they themselves are probably stupid"
10-12-2020T23:30:27,Kiwipower,I’m poor irl so I don’t judge outfit at all.
10-12-2020T23:30:29,SageSaga,shirt*
10-12-2020T23:30:31,Kiwipower,Lol
10-12-2020T23:31:04,Twokinds,Yeah I'm fine with most stuff. I just don't like that blatant in-your-face stuff. Trying too hard.
10-12-2020T23:31:22,MoonDance,Some people do make some... questionable picks of clothing. But if that's what they want go for it
10-12-2020T23:31:31,Zakuru,like the ahegao collage shirts? i haaaate those
10-12-2020T23:31:32,Pwatcher67,"hi all, i i can't see anything on your screen david"
10-12-2020T23:31:43,KeefMcDerpface,hello Pwatcher
10-12-2020T23:32:07,NezumiYuki,Oh common!!  Don't tell me you guys also hate the Sugoi Dekai shirts?!
10-12-2020T23:32:14,Kiwipower,Me either
10-12-2020T23:32:23,Pwatcher67,is twokinds David or tom?
10-12-2020T23:32:28,Kiwipower,Tom
10-12-2020T23:32:31,NezumiYuki,??
10-12-2020T23:32:39,KeefMcDerpface,Last I checked it was Tom...
10-12-2020T23:32:39,Kiwipower,But I can’t see anything either
10-12-2020T23:32:56,InTheLionsDen,It is currently dark
10-12-2020T23:33:04,SageSaga,if someone wants to wear an ahegao shirt ive no issue with it- most people who see it will just be confused by it
10-12-2020T23:33:09,Kiwipower,Oop
10-12-2020T23:33:14,Pwatcher67,i mix him up with the guy who makes dreamkeepers
10-12-2020T23:34:16,SageSaga,guess im lucky you dont get me mixed up with anyone
10-12-2020T23:34:17,MoonDance,I seen so many Ahegao outfits at Ohayocon this year it wasn't funny
10-12-2020T23:34:25,MoonDance,I even as an my little pony one!
10-12-2020T23:35:31,CrRAR,"oo, Kaylin looking chipper"
10-12-2020T23:35:40,NezumiYuki,"For me, the outlandish stuff give me a giggle, so stuff like Sugoi Dekai, Ahegao etc gets my vote"
10-12-2020T23:35:50,NezumiYuki,"Also how's the stream for you now, Tom?"
10-12-2020T23:36:04,Kiwipower,I wouldn’t judge anyone’s outfit unless someone was like having a casual day in a outfit from a music video
10-12-2020T23:36:08,MoonDance,the ramen outfit is okay
10-12-2020T23:36:36,MoonDance,I kinda like outfits of non clother brand brands
10-12-2020T23:37:26,SageSaga,so - how many of you actually read Yosh?
10-12-2020T23:37:47,Kiwipower,What are we drawing now?? 👀
10-12-2020T23:38:01,MoonDance,I do a bit. Still pretty far befind... like super
10-12-2020T23:38:10,NezumiYuki,"Well, I'm still mostly soaking in Artificial Incident, Sage, so I can't say."
10-12-2020T23:38:17,KeefMcDerpface,Only read AI have yet to read Yosh.
10-12-2020T23:38:54,SageSaga,latest Yosh! page has a joke that includes an inside joke of sorts for the chat folks who remember me talking about that idea for a story XD
10-12-2020T23:39:13,SageSaga,"the ""I Became My Own Waifu"" story"
10-12-2020T23:39:15,CrRAR,a willow doth appear~

10-12-2020T23:39:37,MoonDance,Oh yeah!
10-12-2020T23:39:41,Kiwipower,A-a willow??
10-12-2020T23:39:46,MoonDance,"It was a side comic idea, right?"
10-12-2020T23:39:56,SageSaga,nope
10-12-2020T23:39:58,CrRAR,In-dillow
10-12-2020T23:40:04,CrRAR,a willow
10-12-2020T23:40:05,SageSaga,it was an idea for a light novel
10-12-2020T23:40:51,SageSaga,"problem is- most of the people seeing it think im talking about a Chinese comic called ""I am my wife"""
10-12-2020T23:41:03,SageSaga,"and im like - ""no"""
10-12-2020T23:41:19,SageSaga,i looked it up- it's- it's bad
10-12-2020T23:41:33,Ordithus,:eyes: willow
10-12-2020T23:41:41,SageSaga,obviously someone new to writing and making comics- needs a loooot of work
10-12-2020T23:41:45,NezumiYuki,"Wait Sage, there's a chinese comic named ""I am my wife""  ??"
10-12-2020T23:42:04,NezumiYuki,*goes to goog this
10-12-2020T23:42:09,CrRAR,:eyes: d'aww
10-12-2020T23:42:26,SageSaga,yeah- guy gets struck by lightning - goes back in time 10 years- hes a girl now- and goes to school with his old self
10-12-2020T23:42:31,MoonDance,"Sounds like the term ""I'm my own man"" as a gender opposite doesn't sounds as pleasing"
10-12-2020T23:42:44,CrRAR,interestingg
10-12-2020T23:42:52,SageSaga,it sounds like it should be
10-12-2020T23:43:19,SageSaga,but it suffers a lot from poor writing and wonky art
10-12-2020T23:43:22,NezumiYuki,If I may.... I just found this link...  ??  xD
