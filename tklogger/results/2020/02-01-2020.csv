02-01-2020T09:37:57,CrRAR,(we made it)
02-01-2020T09:38:01,CrimsonQuill,Yep
02-01-2020T09:38:12,CrimsonQuill,the 1st and 2nd were rocky for me
02-01-2020T09:38:18,CrimsonQuill,But I'm getting into a stride
02-01-2020T09:38:24,CrimsonQuill,News looks rather bleak though
02-01-2020T09:38:37,CrRAR,"Yeah, right!?"
02-01-2020T09:38:52,CrimsonQuill,Yep
02-01-2020T09:38:56,CrRAR,"Like, we just got to the new year and now THAT!?"
02-01-2020T09:39:08,CrRAR,What a way to start.
02-01-2020T09:39:15,CrimsonQuill,"I swear, if we have WW3..."
02-01-2020T09:39:53,CrRAR,"I was hoping things were looking up out of 2019, but NOPE. *smh*"
02-01-2020T09:40:16,CrimsonQuill,I hate politics and the petty power struggles.
02-01-2020T09:41:31,CrRAR,"Yeah, what's sad is how cyclical it is, it's like there's some sort of war-mongerer playbook these presidents pick up."
02-01-2020T09:41:47,CrimsonQuill,I just want us to have peace...
02-01-2020T09:42:13,CrimsonQuill,"I keep thinking back to the Doctor's Anti-War speech in ""Zygon Inversion."""
02-01-2020T09:42:14,CrRAR,This time we didn't even try to justify it with false intelligence xD

02-01-2020T09:43:09,CrRAR,"Yesss, good quote."
02-01-2020T09:43:15,CrimsonQuill,...
02-01-2020T09:43:21,CrRAR,So many unintended casualties.
02-01-2020T09:43:34,CrRAR,...and a legacy of hatred.
02-01-2020T09:43:40,CrimsonQuill,Let's hope that people SIT DOWN and TALK things out this time.

02-01-2020T09:43:58,CrimsonQuill,Blowing people up is just going to make things worse.
02-01-2020T09:44:16,CrimsonQuill,"XD, not you CrRAR"
02-01-2020T09:44:32,CrRAR,Yeah it only perpetuates the war machine.
02-01-2020T09:45:02,CrRAR,"I agree, make art not war!"
02-01-2020T09:45:16,CrimsonQuill,Yes PLEASE.

02-01-2020T09:48:59,CrimsonQuill,Woah.
02-01-2020T09:49:43,CrRAR,...and we sit around forgetting the anguish created in old wars feeds the animosity everywhere.
02-01-2020T09:50:05,CrRAR,Bad blood only will lead to spilled blood.
02-01-2020T09:50:38,CrimsonQuill,A lot of the troubles today have roots in the past
02-01-2020T09:51:06,CrimsonQuill,"I feel ominously that it is, for the western nations, like th Forerunners and the Precursors in Halo..."
02-01-2020T09:51:36,CrRAR,"TBH, the way I see it, the position of presidents is just a job. We can pick the persona that staffs it, but the same things always need accomplishing."
02-01-2020T09:51:37,CrimsonQuill,"Given that many nations giving problems were colonies that were poorly managed, or not given independence in a stable fashion."
02-01-2020T09:51:45,CrRAR,Yeah
02-01-2020T09:52:24,CrimsonQuill,I look at the rise of unrest in Northern Ireland and the Middle East. It is saying something to us...
02-01-2020T09:52:32,CrimsonQuill,"""I am the monument to all your sins!"""
02-01-2020T09:52:58,CrimsonQuill,And I am afraid.

02-01-2020T09:53:45,CrimsonQuill,"Yes, they do."
02-01-2020T09:53:54,CrimsonQuill,"Empires, however, seldom are good"
02-01-2020T09:54:04,CrRAR,There was a quote from Halo's creator Jason Jones I thing that's haunting... about the nature of the Flood.
02-01-2020T09:54:42,CrRAR,"""Remember that as energetic and tenacious as life is, it has an antithesis just as powerful"""
02-01-2020T09:55:03,CrRAR,aka Don't feed the Flood.
02-01-2020T09:55:18,CrRAR,(especially after midnight) xD
02-01-2020T09:55:26,CrRAR,Bad shit happens.
02-01-2020T09:55:32,CrimsonQuill,Yes indeed....
02-01-2020T09:55:51,CrimsonQuill,Talking about Halo (If I may move the subject from deprssing real world politics...)
02-01-2020T09:56:30,CrimsonQuill,I have been having art frustration
02-01-2020T09:56:48,CrimsonQuill,Because I decided to redraw Raine's Halo ref because I thought it looked a bit off...
02-01-2020T09:57:06,CrRAR,oh? The char sheet?
02-01-2020T09:57:07,CrimsonQuill,"Every time I tried, the sketch was good, then i started inking it...and something went wrong."
02-01-2020T09:57:18,CrimsonQuill,The Halo Char sheet
02-01-2020T09:57:30,CrimsonQuill,Her Haloverse version
02-01-2020T09:57:41,CrRAR,"Lines, yes, but not always the RIGHT ones."
02-01-2020T09:57:47,CrimsonQuill,I have a whole ton of Fireteam luna sketches (and the beginnings of a storyline)
02-01-2020T09:57:55,CrRAR,Yeah I remember.
02-01-2020T09:58:05,CrimsonQuill,First thing that went wrong...her eyes were crosed
02-01-2020T09:58:11,CrimsonQuill,Then her mouth was porly done
02-01-2020T09:58:22,CrimsonQuill,Then her expression just went *DERP*
02-01-2020T09:58:29,CrimsonQuill,I'm on the fourth attempt now.

02-01-2020T10:02:27,CrimsonQuill,She's a bit difficult
02-01-2020T10:02:35,CrimsonQuill,I have a good character arc for her though
02-01-2020T10:02:48,CrimsonQuill,And I have Thomas Bailey's prologue arc in the script stages
02-01-2020T10:03:28,CrRAR,"Hey, look at it this way, once the rough work is done, coloring will be a breeze!"

02-01-2020T10:04:04,CrimsonQuill,I just have to say what Lasky said...
02-01-2020T10:04:07,CrimsonQuill,"""AXIOS!"""
02-01-2020T10:09:29,CrimsonQuill,...But I probably won't be arting much till after Monday

02-01-2020T10:09:43,CrimsonQuill,"Reason being, I have an exam on Monday."
02-01-2020T10:09:49,CrimsonQuill,That I absolutely have to pass.

02-01-2020T10:10:00,CrimsonQuill,Yeah...
02-01-2020T10:10:03,CrRAR,Tom's strategy when all else failed was to just draw rabbits.
02-01-2020T10:10:12,CrimsonQuill,Rabbits?
02-01-2020T10:10:16,CrimsonQuill,OF all things...
02-01-2020T10:10:23,CrimsonQuill,That actually might work
02-01-2020T10:10:30,CrimsonQuill,If I can find some pictures and try it...
02-01-2020T10:10:34,CrRAR,I partly think he drew so many rabbits one came out looking like a squirrel.
02-01-2020T10:10:35,CrimsonQuill,Practice..

02-01-2020T10:11:44,CrimsonQuill,But Imma gonna bounce back
02-01-2020T10:12:05,CrimsonQuill,Usually I just spiral into self-loathing and self-destruction...like over the three months I was away

02-01-2020T22:02:01,CrRAR,Then you would look upon foods and yearn for the delicious tastes.
02-01-2020T22:02:04,Mippy,You’ll have to procure rice elsewhere

02-01-2020T22:42:47,STVL1X,Awww sh*t!! So the steak Flora was chewing at breakfast could be a man/keidran turn into a cow??
02-01-2020T22:42:58,swack24,OH mai!
02-01-2020T22:43:13,CrRAR,"Hey, gotta solve world hunger somehow."
02-01-2020T22:43:17,MrEase,I kinda thought that when I reread Nat and Keith getting the chicken from the table
02-01-2020T22:43:48,HoverdudeXL,Oh
02-01-2020T22:43:57,STVL1X,This just got a lot darker than expected
02-01-2020T22:44:02,MrEase,"if rose can't leave the manor, where'd the table get the chicken from"
02-01-2020T22:44:08,HoverdudeXL,Mo powa babeh
02-01-2020T22:44:17,MuonNeutrino,she can still order stuff and have it delivered
02-01-2020T22:44:21,KeefMcDerpface,Amazon delivery?
02-01-2020T22:44:22,MuonNeutrino,she doesn't have to leave to do that
02-01-2020T22:44:27,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-maevecute:
02-01-2020T22:44:31,QuinnMalachite,Possibly the regular chickens in the manor?
02-01-2020T22:44:34,HoverdudeXL,Cute
02-01-2020T22:44:35,CrRAR,Maeve delivers
02-01-2020T22:44:37,Garrettb1425,medieval door dash
02-01-2020T22:44:37,KeefMcDerpface,Or in this case Tom delivery.
02-01-2020T22:44:44,MuonNeutrino,there's no way magical message delivery isn't part of the mansion's enchantments given all the rest of the stuff it's got
02-01-2020T22:44:44,Twokinds,"The kitchens of the manner used to just make food all day long, constantly."
02-01-2020T22:44:45,QuinnMalachite,or maybe that egg Roan laid is fertilized
02-01-2020T22:44:47,Twokinds,There was a lot of staff.
02-01-2020T22:44:57,HoverdudeXL,Oh0
02-01-2020T22:45:02,SomeNiceUser,Oh...
02-01-2020T22:45:10,ShamusTheFox,Tom's Pizza! With real Keidran toppings for the Nyah lover in you!
02-01-2020T22:45:13,Twokinds,"He employed over 100 people in the building alone, and more in the surrounding area, like the fields."
02-01-2020T22:45:21,HoverdudeXL,Dang
02-01-2020T22:45:26,Ordithus,He must have hosted a ton of events
02-01-2020T22:45:28,BadFoMo,There /was/ a lot of staff?
02-01-2020T22:45:29,Twokinds,The food was placed in storage. Suspended animation.
02-01-2020T22:45:40,Twokinds,"It can then be called upon, and it's just like it was made moments ago."
02-01-2020T22:45:45,ShamusTheFox,"Man, that's some next level magery."
02-01-2020T22:45:46,InTheLionsDen,Along with the staff.
02-01-2020T22:45:46,FluffKevlar,"just like at home, right Tom"

02-01-2020T22:46:52,Twokinds,"Trace got more and more paranoid, and his staff became smaller and smaller."

02-01-2020T22:47:03,HoverdudeXL,Ohh0
02-01-2020T22:47:03,Twokinds,Until it was just Rose and a handful of others.
02-01-2020T22:47:11,HoverdudeXL,Wierd
02-01-2020T22:47:16,IronHorseComics,"wait, others?"
02-01-2020T22:47:23,IronHorseComics,what happened to them?
02-01-2020T22:47:27,Mippy,"Oh, well, paranoia is not fun"
02-01-2020T22:47:28,CrRAR,Sounds like Rose needs a union rep.
02-01-2020T22:47:32,ShamusTheFox,That dark magic really did a number on him.
02-01-2020T22:47:33,CrimsonHelsing,just as we thought
02-01-2020T22:47:35,CrRAR,Lynn!
02-01-2020T22:48:04,SageSaga,Rose got hungry
02-01-2020T22:48:05,PalmettoPathfinder1,I don't think we want to know what happened.  Some things are best left unknown.
02-01-2020T22:48:10,FluffKevlar,"they demanded a Union, worker's comp, and filed a complaint with the BBB until Trace couldn't afford the tax expemtions for dependents in his care"
02-01-2020T22:48:10,SageSaga,so now there is just rose
02-01-2020T22:48:13,RimaDraws,she ate them
02-01-2020T22:48:14,MuonNeutrino,the real question is whether it's *just* Rose now or whether those handful of others are still around
02-01-2020T22:48:15,Ordithus,lol
02-01-2020T22:48:18,PalmettoPathfinder1,Especially when dark magic is involved.

02-01-2020T22:49:02,SomeNiceUser,The Rose Legion.
02-01-2020T22:49:18,ShamusTheFox,What are you talking about? Chaos is awesome. As long as you let others clean up the mess.
02-01-2020T22:49:21,HoverdudeXL,Oh
02-01-2020T22:49:28,Corinthian,Brutus's face looks so innocent in the bottom left panel

02-01-2020T22:49:33,MuonNeutrino,"@Ordithus to be fair, with her magical integration and mysterious 'be everywhere she's needed instantly' habits, it's not impossible that there ARE multiple Roses... or projections of her, anyway"
02-01-2020T22:50:00,MrEase,all the others were turned into rose and no longer exist
02-01-2020T22:50:06,HoverdudeXL,Oh
02-01-2020T22:50:10,MrEase,which might be why there are multiple roses
02-01-2020T22:50:18,MrEase,or she is everywhere at once

02-01-2020T22:55:27,RimaDraws,i still stand by my opinion tho.
02-01-2020T22:55:29,FluffKevlar,GOTTA GO GAAA-GOOO
02-01-2020T22:55:34,CrRAR,bye?

02-01-2020T22:55:44,BadFoMo,Bye?
02-01-2020T22:55:51,FluffKevlar,nvm
02-01-2020T22:55:52,BadFoMo,Oh.
02-01-2020T22:55:53,Rolley,Ooh! Maybe even the evil trace wouldn’t eat a being in the form of livestock so if anyone is transformed and is about to be eaten they turn back.
02-01-2020T22:55:53,CrRAR,lol
02-01-2020T22:56:18,FluffKevlar,i couldnt get into uno peece
02-01-2020T22:56:20,SageSaga,it's from horrible 4kids entertainment saying people cant watch original japanese openings for shows- gotta make our own
02-01-2020T22:56:28,RimaDraws,me either
02-01-2020T22:56:36,Rolley,That’s why the chicken/wolf turned back so suddenly
02-01-2020T22:57:03,CrRAR,Safety first!
02-01-2020T22:57:11,ShamusTheFox,"I mean, let's be realistic: If Evil Trace wanted to kill someone, he could do it pretty easily. The fact that he just transforms them with his defensive spells shows some restraint."
02-01-2020T22:57:22,CrRAR,Friends don't let friends eat friends.
02-01-2020T22:57:27,Ordithus,The transformation spell is Nora's work
02-01-2020T22:57:35,CrRAR,or something
02-01-2020T22:57:38,IronHorseComics,aren't most anime openings in their original weeb dub outlandishly long?
02-01-2020T22:57:44,MrEase,whoa lets not get crazy
02-01-2020T22:57:46,SageSaga,Shamus - are you familiar with things worse than death?
02-01-2020T22:57:49,BadFoMo,@Ordithus That's what I was about to say.
02-01-2020T22:58:00,Rolley,Well Nora is a good “person” at heart
02-01-2020T22:58:03,MuonNeutrino,"@ShamusTheFox keep in mind that Rose's line showed that the transformation spell was courtesy of *nora*, not trace"
02-01-2020T22:58:14,MuonNeutrino,so it may or may not reflect any restraint on his part
02-01-2020T22:58:16,SageSaga,on a list of things worse than death- Enslavement is usually on there
02-01-2020T22:58:23,RimaDraws,yup
02-01-2020T22:58:28,Mippy,I wouldn’t say that Iron Horse but maybe I’m use to it

02-01-2020T22:59:22,SageSaga,hmm - maybe we shouldnt have the stream next week... (MHW Iceborne comes out)
02-01-2020T22:59:29,KeefMcDerpface,"If I remember, most if not all of the defensive spells of the estate were from Nora."

02-01-2020T23:00:17,MuonNeutrino,@KeefMcDerpface afaik we only know for sure about the 'transform intruders into animals' one being from nora
02-01-2020T23:00:27,MuonNeutrino,or at least I don't recall any of the others as being states to be from her
02-01-2020T23:00:34,unsteddyphoenix,Heylo!
02-01-2020T23:00:39,KeefMcDerpface,Good point Muno.
02-01-2020T23:00:40,Ordithus,Teddy!!!
02-01-2020T23:00:42,Mippy,@FluffKevlar isn’t that this gens Naruto?
02-01-2020T23:00:47,unsteddyphoenix,Hows it comin/goin'?
02-01-2020T23:00:48,SageSaga,i will still do the stream- i got work to do - XD but i will be itching to play during so i might sound irritated - that's just gonna be my addiction so dont take offense
02-01-2020T23:00:49,FluffKevlar,"yes, but better written"
02-01-2020T23:01:00,FluffKevlar,"its sure still tropey, but hey"
02-01-2020T23:01:03,MuonNeutrino,"they COULD be from her, but it hasn't been explicitly stated"
02-01-2020T23:01:08,unsteddyphoenix,Naruto didnt start off that bad either
02-01-2020T23:01:22,ShamusTheFox,"Well, the Keidran Transforming Collar and The Grand Templar's transformation were all Trace's doing."
02-01-2020T23:01:24,MrEase,What if Naruto was about superheroes but good and Rock Lee was basically the main character
02-01-2020T23:01:26,KeefMcDerpface,Which is why I include 'most.'
02-01-2020T23:01:30,ZRO4825,Iceborne is fun :3
02-01-2020T23:01:30,FluffKevlar,yeah did ever become the hokitage
02-01-2020T23:01:34,MrEase,thats MHA basically
02-01-2020T23:01:35,ShamusTheFox,So Trace learned some things from Nora.
02-01-2020T23:01:38,SageSaga,Tropes are tools
02-01-2020T23:01:44,Mippy,I lost it around the zombies

02-01-2020T23:02:12,FluffKevlar,MHA wastes a ton of time so not much different there
02-01-2020T23:02:14,SageSaga,Naruto Kai
02-01-2020T23:02:25,IronHorseComics,what if the show had learned the age old thing: SHOW DON'T TELL
02-01-2020T23:02:35,FluffKevlar,but it also has a lot of clever and fun things so
02-01-2020T23:02:41,FluffKevlar,its rather creative at least
02-01-2020T23:02:45,SageSaga,it did Iron

02-01-2020T23:13:00,SageSaga,so - the new book series i started had an announcement in 2018 that an anime was coming out- and they had a trailer... but it hasnt come out and theres been no news

02-01-2020T23:14:24,SageSaga,they didnt but it's strange to release a fully animated trailer - only for the thing to not be released within a year
