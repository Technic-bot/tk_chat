03-06-2020T14:53:52,CrimsonQuill,:)
03-06-2020T14:55:14,SpazztasticKiwi,what does that mean Nora‚Äôs got a thing for ghosts
03-06-2020T14:55:46,SpazztasticKiwi,I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm surprised with how unpicky she seems to be but really
03-06-2020T14:56:01,AspiringNoodle,hi peeps :D
03-06-2020T14:57:15,CrimsonQuill,Ullo
03-06-2020T14:57:22,CrimsonQuill,Day off tomorrow
03-06-2020T14:57:26,CrimsonQuill,Game night
03-06-2020T14:57:29,Roughlandin,Noice
03-06-2020T14:57:31,CrimsonQuill,Household chores
03-06-2020T14:57:45,CrimsonQuill,And I can make some sketches for my sketch-a-day thingamabob on Deviantart
03-06-2020T14:58:26,CrimsonQuill,"Also...anyone who has a Tablet (Tom included), any advice for a complete beginner? Because I have a WACOM One I ordered on a whim coming on the 15th"
03-06-2020T14:58:50,SpazztasticKiwi,I draw on my phone
03-06-2020T15:00:01,CrimsonQuill,:ptv-shock: Uuuuuuh....Phone screens are so Smol!
03-06-2020T15:00:28,SpazztasticKiwi,I zoom in & out alot
03-06-2020T15:01:09,CrimsonQuill,Aheheheh
03-06-2020T15:02:17,TerraTheWizard,find out how to set brush stabilisation on the art program you want to use
03-06-2020T15:02:20,TerraTheWizard,it'll help
03-06-2020T15:02:21,TerraTheWizard,a lot
03-06-2020T15:02:44,CrimsonQuill,Brush Stabalisation?
03-06-2020T15:03:04,TerraTheWizard,smooths out the wobbles your hand does that you don't want in the art
03-06-2020T15:03:12,TerraTheWizard,gives you nice lines instead of wiggly ones
03-06-2020T15:03:28,CrimsonQuill,Oh crumbs!
03-06-2020T15:03:31,CrimsonQuill,Thanks Terra
03-06-2020T15:04:23,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúI want a straight line‚Äù
03-06-2020T15:04:27,CrimsonQuill,That will be VERY handy.
03-06-2020T15:04:29,SpazztasticKiwi,‚Äúok I‚Äôll curve it‚Äù
03-06-2020T15:04:34,TerraTheWizard,straight line is easier
03-06-2020T15:04:35,CrimsonQuill,I'm going to be using Krita
03-06-2020T15:04:37,TerraTheWizard,just hold shift
03-06-2020T15:04:38,SpazztasticKiwi,"‚Äúno, I said a straight line‚Äù"
03-06-2020T15:04:40,TerraTheWizard,line tool shortcut
03-06-2020T15:04:41,CrimsonQuill,XD
03-06-2020T15:04:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"‚Äúno, you want it curved‚Äù"
03-06-2020T15:05:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"‚Äúno, StRaIgHt‚Äù"
03-06-2020T15:05:03,TerraTheWizard,oh gods
03-06-2020T15:05:07,SpazztasticKiwi,‚Äúdon‚Äôt wanna‚Äù
03-06-2020T15:05:07,CrimsonQuill,"I admit, the main reason I'm getting a tablet is because I don't know how I'll be able to draw the comic the way I want without it"
03-06-2020T15:05:08,TerraTheWizard,krita is useable
03-06-2020T15:05:12,TerraTheWizard,but ehhh
03-06-2020T15:05:20,TerraTheWizard,it likes to overcomplicate everything
03-06-2020T15:05:31,CrimsonQuill,I can't really go for photoshop
03-06-2020T15:05:37,TerraTheWizard,there are other free ones
03-06-2020T15:05:47,TerraTheWizard,i recommend medibang paint pro
03-06-2020T15:05:48,CrimsonQuill,I've been getting so many things lately that I am now going to be saving hard.
03-06-2020T15:05:54,TerraTheWizard,or firealpaca
03-06-2020T15:06:03,CrimsonQuill,Medibang or Firealpaca? i'll give them a shot
03-06-2020T15:06:06,SpazztasticKiwi,stabilization is very useful don‚Äôt get me wrong but it can take several tries before it actually gets the line smoothness I want
03-06-2020T15:06:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"I could just be picky but with lettering and b&w line art work, you gotta be"
03-06-2020T15:06:54,CrimsonQuill,"One day, I'll be as good as the other artists are, and I can finally say, 'I CAN ART!'"
03-06-2020T15:11:21,Roughlandin,"Are we still doing a sketch stream this week? I understand Tom's probably been pretty busy. He's had A LOT of coloring work to do for this week. Plus, not to get topical, but stuff here in the US has been... pretty bonkers this week."
03-06-2020T15:12:39,CrimsonQuill,Been reading the news on it...
03-06-2020T15:12:52,CrimsonQuill,So I can understand that things are a little more difficult than usual.
03-06-2020T15:12:58,CrimsonQuill,To put it mildly.
03-06-2020T15:13:13,CrimsonQuill,"I'll be honest, I am legitimately worrying about safety over there."
03-06-2020T15:16:31,Roughlandin,"Yeah, tensions are kind of high here right now, to say the least. Stay safe, to all my US local folk in chat!"
03-06-2020T15:17:35,CrimsonQuill,And a stay-safe to you all from the British Isles!

03-06-2020T15:25:22,SpazztasticKiwi,as much as I like actually moving the thing in my hands to work on it - much of the reason I like my mini clay work - I‚Äôve had to try starting on digital
03-06-2020T15:25:34,SpazztasticKiwi,much harder to lose your copy that way
03-06-2020T15:31:03,JojoGD,I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm doing decent progress on bloodbath bath
03-06-2020T15:31:37,JojoGD,I close to completing ASonic‚Äôs and GGBOY‚Äôs part

03-06-2020T17:29:03,SpazztasticKiwi,what are parents gonna tell their kids about Santa this year
03-06-2020T17:50:00,SpazztasticKiwi,"if mule day happens this year, there‚Äôs a period ball"
