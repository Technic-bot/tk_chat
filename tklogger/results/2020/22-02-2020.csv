22-02-2020T17:30:16,Roughlandin,^ What Terra said
22-02-2020T17:30:17,TLDragon,Clovis would be more like Hel.
22-02-2020T17:30:21,vevans0009,Cause he genderbends?
22-02-2020T17:30:27,Roughlandin,Nah Natani is Hel
22-02-2020T17:30:43,Ordithus,Raine <3
22-02-2020T17:30:52,sybaris1,Kat would be Neith

22-02-2020T17:31:09,vevans0009,Guess Flora would Bastet then.
22-02-2020T17:31:10,hyneria,Zen is a good Loki
22-02-2020T17:31:11,ProsePro7,Natani could be Dionysis

22-02-2020T17:31:57,Roughlandin,I'm thinking more Patron aspects than specific mythologies

22-02-2020T18:16:35,vevans0009,Now is this Teen Rose?
22-02-2020T18:16:55,Roughlandin,"But they ARE adults. I don't know why that confuses so many people. Like, literally every time a adult Maeve/Maddie pic gets posted"
22-02-2020T18:16:58,vevans0009,Oh its not
22-02-2020T18:17:06,Muddy,Sooo teen Rose is 5?
22-02-2020T18:17:22,ThingsAreMoving,We'll know once Tom puts the text in
22-02-2020T18:17:41,vevans0009,"So its pup Rose, Teen Rose, Adult Rose and ""Old"" Rose?"
22-02-2020T18:17:50,Twokinds,She's maeve's age there
22-02-2020T18:17:56,ThingsAreMoving,But for consistency I think he'd use the same age spans as in Maeve chart

22-02-2020T18:19:02,Muddy,I wonder if I’d have less foot pain if the had feet like a Keidran?
22-02-2020T18:19:11,ThingsAreMoving,Old doesn't mean she's less of a character.
22-02-2020T18:19:20,ThingsAreMoving,We still <3 her

22-02-2020T18:56:15,Roughlandin,Plot twist. Trace and Saria never actually got married. He just told everybody and since he was Grand Templar they had to believe him

22-02-2020T18:57:05,falangie123,i thought the similarity was a plot point?
22-02-2020T18:57:12,ThingsAreMoving,Maren was his gf for a while
22-02-2020T18:57:22,vevans0009,See another nod to Saria and her
22-02-2020T18:57:32,Mediawatcher,Yeah but trace just used her to potentially bring back saria
22-02-2020T18:57:33,KeefMcDerpface,Apparently people didn't get that falangie.
22-02-2020T18:57:34,vevans0009,Its ALL connected
22-02-2020T18:57:35,LyricZ,The similarity is currently a huge plot point
22-02-2020T18:57:40,Roughlandin,It's implied Trace only started his relationship with Maren because she looked like Saria
22-02-2020T18:57:46,vevans0009,^
22-02-2020T18:57:56,falangie123,poor maren

22-02-2020T18:58:01,Twokinds,Trace was going around to small towns like Marens to find candidates.

22-02-2020T18:58:15,vevans0009,Trace was a freaky man
22-02-2020T18:58:22,TeapotOfDoom,That sounds even more creepy
22-02-2020T18:58:22,TLDragon,"eh, looks like a teleportation effect more than Trace vanishing."
22-02-2020T18:58:26,Roughlandin,Old Trace was a bastard man
22-02-2020T18:58:30,DarthRexKing,"What can I say, he's had a very bad LEGACY. :V"
22-02-2020T18:58:31,Mediawatcher,"Yikes, let’s hope they can save her because man trace was a monster"

22-02-2020T18:58:48,ThingsAreMoving,Most wanted: Saria lookalikes
22-02-2020T18:58:51,Twokinds,"Trace thought Maren was close enough, but what really solidified it was Maren's strong personality. She didn't treat him with fear and respect, which made him hate her, and decide then to use her."
22-02-2020T18:58:59,vevans0009,"You know what Flora, Saria and Maren ALL have in common?"
22-02-2020T18:59:02,Ordithus,he doesn't understand what he's missing

22-02-2020T19:05:15,vevans0009,He was happy.  Saria died.  He got pissed and did nasty things.

22-02-2020T19:05:45,Roughlandin,Exactly. He was a regular old work obsessed slaver jerk. Instead of a mass murdering lunatic slaver jerk
22-02-2020T19:05:49,Twokinds,But that's typical of a human of the time

22-02-2020T19:06:02,Avolendi,I'm guessing Trace is doing something rather stupid in the sketch moment :)

22-02-2020T22:37:44,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-floraquestion: I wonder if the lewder version of my suggestion would have gotten more votes?
22-02-2020T22:38:07,Ordithus,"Wait, this audience, why am I asking :ctwokinds-sytheeyebrows:"
22-02-2020T22:38:26,Roughlandin,Probably. Also probably wouldn't have been allowed lol
22-02-2020T22:38:37,Twokinds,Goodbye everyone headed out!
22-02-2020T22:38:44,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,Goodbye
22-02-2020T22:38:44,Ordithus,Clearly it wasn't :ctwokinds-reniembarrassed:
22-02-2020T22:39:06,AspiringNoodle,"Ord, lol"
22-02-2020T22:39:26,AspiringNoodle,I was thinking about that pic where Nora more or less teased her tongue at Flora
22-02-2020T22:39:38,AspiringNoodle,And imagined what would happen if she did that to Jade
22-02-2020T22:39:51,AspiringNoodle,But it would probably be too l00d
22-02-2020T22:39:52,JojoF2415,I’m working on this drawing with flora holding a falchion sword on one hand and the ban hammer on the other
22-02-2020T22:40:01,Roughlandin,I'm still torn on whether to resubmit my Adira Advice sequel or try something new. Guess I've got a couple weeks to think on it

22-02-2020T22:42:18,JojoF2415,Lol
22-02-2020T22:45:03,Roughlandin,"Welp. That does it for me, y'all. See everybody for next weeks color stream. Gonna be another hard moth to narrow down the vote on"

22-02-2020T22:49:32,steelabjur,@AspiringNoodle this took me far longer to find than it should have: https://www.patreon.com/posts/nora-and-flora-27570434
22-02-2020T22:51:45,KeefMcDerpface,"After those two incidents, I feel like Nora wouldn't dare to stick out her tongue at anyone."
22-02-2020T22:52:20,Ordithus,I guess Saria was not so cruel
22-02-2020T22:52:32,Ordithus,"She did say yes, after all"
22-02-2020T22:53:21,steelabjur,"Besides, Nora probably likes it. After all, she likes getting chained up. ;)"
22-02-2020T22:53:45,KeefMcDerpface,*New kink discovered.*
22-02-2020T22:56:01,SpazztasticKiwi,how dare kitty do a bad right after I gave him some chicken
22-02-2020T22:56:23,JojoF2415,I want to finish that time lapse today but I don’t think I’ll be able to
22-02-2020T22:56:25,SpazztasticKiwi,"but hey, what’d we get done here"
22-02-2020T22:59:44,AspiringNoodle,Thanks steel
22-02-2020T22:59:56,Ordithus,arts were done
22-02-2020T22:59:59,AspiringNoodle,"I'm just imagining someone grabbing her tongue and being like: ""You. My bed. NOW."""
22-02-2020T23:00:17,KeefMcDerpface,haha
22-02-2020T23:00:21,AspiringNoodle,I wonder if Nora would blush at that proposition
22-02-2020T23:00:40,RimaDraws,night all! <3

22-02-2020T23:09:13,Twokinds,It'd take a lot to make Nora blush
22-02-2020T23:09:29,KeefMcDerpface,has signed off
22-02-2020T23:11:21,unsteddyphoenix,Trace saying yes unexpectedly?

22-02-2020T23:16:00,SpazztasticKiwi,beatle is
22-02-2020T23:16:58,AspiringNoodle,"Yeah, Raine writing a fanfic that ticks off all of Nora's kinks should do it :p"
22-02-2020T23:17:17,AspiringNoodle,Ofc... then she'd probably drag Raine to the mindscape to act out the story :ptv-laugh:
22-02-2020T23:17:40,AspiringNoodle,"""C-can I not do this?..."""
22-02-2020T23:17:43,AspiringNoodle,"""No."""

22-02-2020T23:21:34,Twokinds,I don't know what a click beatle is no
22-02-2020T23:31:32,steelabjur,"IIRC, it's a beetle that can make a clicking sound with it's exoskeleton."
22-02-2020T23:34:40,steelabjur,"Assuming that's what @SpazztasticKiwi meant. Have them in Ohio, at least when I still lived there."
22-02-2020T23:36:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"they make the noise yeah but I was wondering cause if you’ve seen one, I’d be fun to see Flora’s reaction to one"
22-02-2020T23:36:40,Ordithus,"She's cat, would probably attempt to eat it"
22-02-2020T23:36:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"when they fall on their back, their two plated bodies flex at the hinge and flip themselves back over"
22-02-2020T23:37:06,SpazztasticKiwi,making a click sound
22-02-2020T23:37:58,JojoF2415,Inking a drawing is entertaining
22-02-2020T23:37:59,SpazztasticKiwi,"animals, primarily cats, are often fascinated by them"
22-02-2020T23:38:24,SpazztasticKiwi,"they don’t bite, so it’s rather entertaining to watch them"
22-02-2020T23:41:30,Ordithus,cats are curious lil buggers
22-02-2020T23:41:47,Ordithus,"Had a cat, she killed a wasp.  I had to spot her from eating it"
22-02-2020T23:42:45,JojoF2415,"I have a cat. Out of all of the cats in the world, it had to be that furball that killed my chicken"
22-02-2020T23:43:37,JojoF2415,not even the stray cats get close to them. They just ignore my chickens
22-02-2020T23:44:00,steelabjur,"Clovis, dressed only in a robe, dancing in front of a mirror ala Buffalo Bill from Silence of the Lambs. ""Would you do me? I'd do me!"" Someone's comment on Cute Clovis gave me that mental imagine and I must share. :x"
22-02-2020T23:44:05,JojoF2415,i feed my cat but he seriously pissed me off that day
22-02-2020T23:44:37,Ordithus,that's awful.
22-02-2020T23:45:02,Ordithus,Same cat did attempt to kill a bird we took care of for a while.  Had some close calls
22-02-2020T23:45:24,JojoF2415,Some random person is stealing my chicken eggs
22-02-2020T23:47:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"cats chase anything that moves, the smaller the more likely they attack"
22-02-2020T23:48:00,JojoF2415,I don't know who it is but we put a lock on the fence where the chickens are at
22-02-2020T23:48:04,AspiringNoodle,housecats are one of the worst invasive species to plague the planet :c
22-02-2020T23:48:19,JojoF2415,A pet tiger
22-02-2020T23:49:01,JojoF2415,I had a pet peacock once. My dad gave it away so it can breed
22-02-2020T23:50:01,SpazztasticKiwi,peacocks are like any other bird
22-02-2020T23:50:03,SpazztasticKiwi,loud

22-02-2020T23:50:36,JojoF2415,It was on top of the roof one time
22-02-2020T23:50:38,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m fine seeing them and any other animal at a zoo
22-02-2020T23:50:41,SpazztasticKiwi,not at home
22-02-2020T23:50:58,Ordithus,they are allowed to just roam the Milwaukee Zoo
22-02-2020T23:50:59,SpazztasticKiwi,not since I lived with when my sister had 5 cockatiels at once
22-02-2020T23:51:00,JojoF2415,I still have the tail feathers though. They fall off
22-02-2020T23:51:23,JojoF2415,My house is a zoo
22-02-2020T23:51:24,SpazztasticKiwi,you wanna talk about noise
22-02-2020T23:51:47,Ordithus,Open plan offices?
22-02-2020T23:51:51,Ordithus,Those are loud
22-02-2020T23:52:07,SpazztasticKiwi,"not counting them tho, now I get to deal with my moms obsession with dogs"
22-02-2020T23:52:46,SpazztasticKiwi,three of them technically are my sisters with two being permanent
22-02-2020T23:52:54,JojoF2415,"I have a pet cat named Nino, a bearded dragon, a jungle carpet python, 7 chickens, 3 desert tortoises"
22-02-2020T23:53:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Gingers old but the sweetest and never any trouble
22-02-2020T23:53:21,SpazztasticKiwi,bear stays in her room with her

22-02-2020T23:54:02,Ordithus,I'm looking to get dog when the snow melts
22-02-2020T23:54:24,SpazztasticKiwi,"He doesn’t shut up, like my moms little. whiny as hell. chihuahua mix"
22-02-2020T23:54:47,Ordithus,that's annoying

22-02-2020T23:55:24,JojoF2415,I have a pet snek
22-02-2020T23:56:24,SpazztasticKiwi,"I despise going shopping with her most often cause as soon as the car stops, he whines. as soon as she steps out of his eyesight or bubble, he whines"
22-02-2020T23:56:29,JojoF2415,he/she doesn't have a name yet
22-02-2020T23:56:39,SpazztasticKiwi,“bUt He’S tRaInEd”
22-02-2020T23:57:35,SpazztasticKiwi,makes it worse is people always think he’s so cute and delightful and precious dressed up in his sweaters and sitting in the shopping cart
22-02-2020T23:58:26,JojoF2415,my cat gave me a 3 inch scar
22-02-2020T23:58:35,SpazztasticKiwi,"cute and whatever yeah, but not always tolerable to be around, especially if you’re like me and love peace and quiet"
22-02-2020T23:59:06,JojoF2415,2 mm wide
22-02-2020T23:59:39,JojoF2415,he used my leg as a launch pad
22-02-2020T23:59:42,SpazztasticKiwi,ever tried to get sleep with a gaggle of dogs being let out in the mornings barking when you have a late shift?
