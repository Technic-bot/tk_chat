15-05-2020T00:18:24,DarthRexKing,OH THIS SONG! I forgot the name of this song. Can someone remind me?
15-05-2020T00:18:36,DarthRexKing,I have been trying to remember but my memory sucks.

15-05-2020T00:22:38,AspiringNoodle,I find myself listening to more stuff from japan and lyricless titles these days
15-05-2020T00:23:08,DarthRexKing,"Ah, this song is a classic. X3"
15-05-2020T00:23:14,SageSaga,XD
15-05-2020T00:25:58,SageSaga,i saw that tweet from Tony Hawk again recently- the one that went like this-
15-05-2020T00:26:41,SageSaga,"Woman - ""Are you Tony Hawk?"" Tony - ""Yes I am."" Woman - ""But Why?"" I didn't know how to answer her"
15-05-2020T00:27:00,DarthRexKing,>W> Lol.
15-05-2020T00:27:30,AspiringNoodle,My brain can't even comprehend the level of stupidity right there
15-05-2020T00:27:34,Sclimshady,She has a point
15-05-2020T00:29:35,SageSaga,now listen to this amazing song
15-05-2020T00:29:50,Mihari,That quality difference!

15-05-2020T00:31:33,AspiringNoodle,But it sure as hell ain't NOT catchy!
15-05-2020T00:31:37,SageSaga,you dont need to- just feeeeeel it
15-05-2020T00:31:54,SageSaga,it has a whimsical nature!
15-05-2020T00:32:20,Ordithus,whimsy is good
15-05-2020T00:32:21,SageSaga,it says the world is tough- but it's amazing too!
15-05-2020T00:33:19,AspiringNoodle,I can't help but think back to SAO's first opening
15-05-2020T00:38:37,DarthRexKing,"So, when will we see the female jojo? When will the next season of JoJo come out? I haven't watched that much of the anime but I understand there are long breaks in between each series?"
15-05-2020T00:39:55,SageSaga,yeah it takes a while
15-05-2020T00:40:49,JojoGD,Hi

15-05-2020T01:25:38,AspiringNoodle,"Sage, have I said that I love the spiderweb motif?  I love the spiderweb motif."
15-05-2020T01:25:45,AspiringNoodle,Though maybe the exposed chest is helping c:
15-05-2020T01:26:25,SageSaga,XD
15-05-2020T01:26:33,Ordithus,spider boobs
15-05-2020T01:26:55,SageSaga,well you know why she has a spiderweb right?
15-05-2020T01:27:20,BadFoMo,So she can walk on walls?
15-05-2020T01:27:27,SageSaga,yep
15-05-2020T01:27:48,BadFoMo,Yay! I remembered something!
15-05-2020T01:27:51,AspiringNoodle,I knew about that :P
15-05-2020T01:28:00,Ordithus,"spider elf, spider elf, does whatever spider elf does"
15-05-2020T01:28:17,SageSaga,it's sympathetic enchanting
15-05-2020T01:30:23,Ordithus,"So if Nyna's sleeves can get longer, can the rest of it?"
15-05-2020T01:30:29,Ordithus,"Like, the bottom part"
15-05-2020T01:30:34,SageSaga,yep
15-05-2020T01:30:37,SageSaga,shes done it too
15-05-2020T01:30:46,Mihari,It can also the other way! :D
15-05-2020T01:30:51,Ordithus,ohmy
15-05-2020T01:31:05,SageSaga,yeah it can turn into a strip of cloth
15-05-2020T01:32:14,SageSaga,makes it really easy to clean
15-05-2020T01:36:31,Ordithus,"Ah, found the long form"

15-05-2020T01:55:17,SuigetsuYussaki,Hello
15-05-2020T01:55:40,SuigetsuYussaki,"May I ask, who is Maty?"
15-05-2020T02:00:53,SageSaga,im back
15-05-2020T02:02:33,SageSaga,Suigetsu if you are still around- Maty is an artist friend that doesnt draw much but when she does they are generally thick lewdie
15-05-2020T02:03:23,SuigetsuYussaki,"Sorry if my english is broken, but does it take commissions? Where do I find this artist?"
15-05-2020T02:04:34,SageSaga,Her twitter is @matypup but i don't know if shes doing commissions right now
15-05-2020T02:05:02,SageSaga,her twitter is also NSFW so - warning
15-05-2020T02:05:20,SageSaga,should have lead with that but im distracted
15-05-2020T02:05:58,SuigetsuYussaki,Thank you very much
15-05-2020T02:07:17,SageSaga,np
15-05-2020T02:17:18,ZRO4825,Maty's stuff is <3
15-05-2020T02:17:23,ZRO4825,Got a pic of my kitty from her. =D
15-05-2020T02:18:39,Dadrobit,Fer fucks sake. Chasing kids trying to run from me in a golf cart is not how I wanted to spend my Friday night....
15-05-2020T02:19:34,BadFoMo,Did you catch them?
15-05-2020T02:19:51,BadFoMo,"Also, what did they do?"
15-05-2020T02:20:16,Dadrobit,Bout a dozen kids fucking around in somebody else's house under construction. 8 of them were reasonable. 2 tried booking it in the golf cart.
15-05-2020T02:20:47,Dadrobit,"When I say kids, I mean 15-18 btw."
15-05-2020T02:21:33,SageSaga,savages
15-05-2020T02:21:39,Dadrobit,Called the parents of the kids who had invited their friends to the party.
15-05-2020T02:22:48,Dadrobit,"""Hey Mrs. So-and-so, I have your kids and most of their friends here, are there two other kids at your house that took a golf cart to get there?"""
15-05-2020T02:23:35,Dadrobit,"""Huh, no, they should all be.... Wait, two of them just pulled into my driveway.... What happened this time, Dadrobit..."""
15-05-2020T02:24:05,SageSaga,"""if you do not send the apology letter and come to pick them up in the next 15 minutes i'm going to start executing them every minute"""
15-05-2020T02:25:10,SageSaga,"""Can you start with billy? we will be there in 16 minutes-"""
15-05-2020T02:25:19,Dadrobit,"Long story short, no more friends for a long time, and no more golf cart privileges. I also had to wait around while their parents arrived so I could explain to all of them that their kids are lucky as fuck that I was called instead of the police..."
15-05-2020T02:26:20,Dadrobit,"When I say under construction, I mean 99.5% complete. Foyer chandelier lights up and everything."
15-05-2020T02:26:26,SageSaga,jeez-
15-05-2020T02:26:35,Dadrobit,So these idiots were just
15-05-2020T02:26:58,SageSaga,in someones house
15-05-2020T02:27:00,Dadrobit,"""having fun"" in someone else very legitimate home."
15-05-2020T02:27:15,SageSaga,that's messed up
15-05-2020T02:27:53,Dadrobit,"Had to do a ""quick"" inspection to make sure there was no obvious damage, but it still took a while. Big fuckin mansion."
15-05-2020T02:28:38,Dadrobit,Thankfully the kids that stayed knew they were fucked enough and didn't try screwing with me any more than what had transpired.
15-05-2020T02:31:27,sunblaze,"what gave them the idea that was a ""proper"" thing to do? are were they just idiots?"
15-05-2020T02:32:11,Dadrobit,It's just.... Ughhhh. The family in general is one of my favorite groups of people. Real decent folks. Fuckin sucks that their sons decided to screw up like this and I have to give them all the bad guy talk.
15-05-2020T02:33:25,SageSaga,"better than ""your kids were tresspassing and now are all dead"""
15-05-2020T02:33:34,Dadrobit,"Teenage kids, sun. Having a little party for the sake of a party. Told the parents they were just gonna hang out at the top of the mountain. Big idiot mistakes."
15-05-2020T02:33:39,sunblaze,yeah USA I forgot that :(
15-05-2020T02:34:35,Dadrobit,"Yeah, a lot of my residents are gun owners. I was in one of their houses a while back. They even had an underground shooting range."
15-05-2020T02:34:56,BadFoMo,I remember that.
15-05-2020T02:37:20,SageSaga,the US is pretty messed up- i follow this guy on twitter- he had talked about his neighbor before- the guy taught him about weapons- how to safely use them and be responsible- 3 weeks into the covid crisis and he finds out his neighbor shot and killed his
15-05-2020T02:37:26,SageSaga,kid- then his wife- and then himself
15-05-2020T02:37:44,sunblaze,oh dear :(
15-05-2020T02:38:14,Dadrobit,So now it's all in the HOA's hands. Monday they're gonna find out and the homeowner of the construction lot will get to hear what happened.
15-05-2020T02:38:27,SageSaga,im  like- so what exactly is a responsible gun owner? someone wealthy and healthy enough to not be at risk of breaking under stress?
15-05-2020T02:39:11,Dadrobit,"Yeah, that's one of the side effects of the quarantine. All the people who suffer from domestic abuse already are cooped up on a whole nother level."
15-05-2020T02:40:46,SageSaga,"""I have created the ultimate gun safety device- this here is a robot that you give all your guns to- in the event of an emergency it will dispense guns and will also act as your shield and can fire guns on its own. It is capable of determining your stress"
15-05-2020T02:40:49,Dadrobit,"That and isolated people. If someone notices someone else is missing for a while, courtesy calls are always an option. But whose gonna notice someone's no longer active in their neighborhood when nobody is active?"
15-05-2020T02:40:57,SageSaga,levels and will take your weapons if you are unstable
15-05-2020T02:41:12,sunblaze,that sounds like the game Borderlands sage......
15-05-2020T02:41:30,SageSaga,"""what do we do if the robots turn against us and now have our guns?"""
15-05-2020T02:41:52,SageSaga,"""didnt you hear me? they were already gun proof- what would the guns have done?"""
15-05-2020T02:42:08,Dadrobit,Suddenly the preppers burying Mosins in PVC pipes in their backyard are gonna be useful.
15-05-2020T02:43:41,SageSaga,"""I dont understand! The robots are rising up against us- but our children are siding with the robots!"" ""Curses! Its because they were raised by nannybots!"""
15-05-2020T02:44:15,sunblaze,granny is there as well. since grannybot is so useful to her
15-05-2020T02:44:49,SageSaga,and that is how the robots win- a social victory
15-05-2020T02:45:02,sunblaze,its like on a street in the wrong direction. ONE wrong dirver? they are ALL in the wrong direction!
15-05-2020T02:46:12,Dadrobit,"""Sir, the robots are demanding equal rights and treatment!"" ""Curse those deep state snowflake robots!"""
15-05-2020T02:47:08,Dadrobit,Deepstate Snowflake Robot is my new underground Ska Electronica band name.
15-05-2020T02:47:18,sunblaze,haha
15-05-2020T02:47:32,sunblaze,"I created ""emergency retribution waffles"" last week"
15-05-2020T02:47:52,sunblaze,becuase thats exactly what I did I had to bake waffles for my mum to avoid retribution :D
15-05-2020T02:48:10,Dadrobit,"Ahhh, I get it"
15-05-2020T02:48:26,sunblaze,I totally forgot mothers day. fail me :P
15-05-2020T02:48:39,SageSaga,"""Sir! The robots are demanding higher wages!"" ""Wait- but all their wages are going to the people of the country, they dont get any of it-"" ""So- they just want us to give more to the citizens?"" ""Seems so"" ""Such kind robots"""
15-05-2020T02:49:47,Dadrobit,"Didn't forget it, but it still sucked. Was talking about it before, but I really wanted to take my grandma out for dinner for Mother's Day, then I remembered..."
15-05-2020T02:50:48,SageSaga,"the happy worker imitative - ""Alright robot 302, we are resigning you from packing to collection"" ""But- I love packing!"" *beep beep* ""But now i love collecting more!"" *whirls away*"
15-05-2020T02:50:57,SageSaga,initiative*
15-05-2020T02:51:30,sunblaze,happy worker? more like instant brainwash
15-05-2020T02:52:10,Dadrobit,"I took a split second to go from, ""boy wouldn't that be nice to be able to do for my own interests,"" to go to, ""oh fuck no, that's a horrific premise!"""
15-05-2020T02:54:12,sunblaze,did the day at least end well?
15-05-2020T02:56:22,Dadrobit,My day isn't even half way over yet.
15-05-2020T03:01:41,SageSaga,ya ever watch an anime - that was kinda dry but you kinda liked- and then ya read the manga- and its  still dry but you still wanna know more- and then you find out theres a ton of light novels- but you are worried to start reading them because they might
15-05-2020T03:01:50,SageSaga,be even more dry than the manga and anime?
15-05-2020T03:02:23,unsteddyphoenix,I do occassionally have moments of like
15-05-2020T03:02:42,sunblaze,sure that happens :D
15-05-2020T03:02:53,unsteddyphoenix,"""This writing is so dumb. Nothing's happening, I bet nothing's going to happen."""
15-05-2020T03:02:56,Dadrobit,Actually no. But I don't watch a ton of anime or manga. So that's kinda a thing.
15-05-2020T03:02:59,unsteddyphoenix,*watches all 3 seasons*
15-05-2020T03:03:34,SageSaga,im kinda inbetween a bunch of series at the moment- got a good book - but im looking forward to the other books-
15-05-2020T03:03:36,SageSaga,buuuuut
15-05-2020T03:03:53,SageSaga,theres this series i keep seeing that i saw the anime and manga and im like- maaaaaan
15-05-2020T03:03:55,sunblaze,nah tht does not happen to me. I usally give a series 3 maybe 4 episodes if it had not caught my interest by then its rearly worth it anyway
15-05-2020T03:04:06,SageSaga,it wasnt a great series- but it did do some stuff i really enjoyed XD
15-05-2020T03:04:10,Dadrobit,There's a difference between a slow burn anime and one that just doesn't go anywhere. I can't stand media that just doesn't go anywhere.
15-05-2020T03:05:09,SageSaga,i can get behind that Robit
15-05-2020T03:05:35,SageSaga,like- Ascendance of a Bookworm is a reeeeeally long series - but it moves!
15-05-2020T03:08:43,Dadrobit,"Not to sound like a weirdo, but I was brought in to watching MLP by a couple IRL friends and honestly it was pretty good for the first few seasons because every episode and series arc contained actual character development."
15-05-2020T03:09:03,unsteddyphoenix,what a weirdo
15-05-2020T03:09:23,SageSaga,yeah MLP was legit pretty good for a while
15-05-2020T03:09:35,SageSaga,but then the characters kinda stopped
15-05-2020T03:09:35,Dadrobit,"But later on, they were just rehashing the same exact character flaws and development over and over again. Like every show was just a reset."
15-05-2020T03:10:15,sunblaze,yeah sage sadly it did. 4-5 seasons great then it kinda turned wothout moving at all
15-05-2020T03:10:46,SageSaga,one of the things i like about a lot of Isekai stories is they often have OP characters- but they grow in different ways
15-05-2020T03:11:24,SageSaga,its better when they are powerful but not all powerful
15-05-2020T03:11:43,SageSaga,but still- even god tier ones can be fine if they still grow socially
15-05-2020T03:11:47,sunblaze,otherwise its the dragonball-meme
15-05-2020T03:11:56,sunblaze,OP chars give them even MORE OP enemies!
15-05-2020T03:12:08,Dadrobit,Isekai is the one where they're brought/reincarnated to another world?
15-05-2020T03:12:13,sunblaze,^yes that
15-05-2020T03:12:17,SageSaga,yes
15-05-2020T03:12:44,SageSaga,isekai means - another world
15-05-2020T03:13:24,Dadrobit,Yu yu hakasho. Would that not kinda fit?
15-05-2020T03:14:05,SageSaga,not really because it takes place mostly in the real world- and the spiritual world is just a hidden part of the world
15-05-2020T03:14:09,SageSaga,like Harry Potter
15-05-2020T03:14:15,Dadrobit,S'the closest thing I can think of that I watched.
15-05-2020T03:14:21,SageSaga,Wizard of Oz?
15-05-2020T03:14:30,unsteddyphoenix,dorothy op
15-05-2020T03:14:42,unsteddyphoenix,Oneshots one of the strongest characters instantly
15-05-2020T03:14:52,SageSaga,XD
15-05-2020T03:14:56,Dadrobit,"Yeah, that's what I was thinking. It's like more hidden from others more than ""other"" world."
15-05-2020T03:14:58,SageSaga,ty Unsteddy
15-05-2020T03:15:27,Dadrobit,IMeanIGuess.png
15-05-2020T03:16:33,SageSaga,what animes have ya seen?
15-05-2020T03:16:48,Dadrobit,"Makes me wonder if you you hakasho still holds up. I remember really liking it at the time, but that was like 11 year old me"
15-05-2020T03:16:49,SageSaga,Escaflowne? Sword Art Online? .Hack?
15-05-2020T03:16:58,ZRO4825,.Hack! <3
15-05-2020T03:17:04,Dadrobit,Ohhhh! Escaflowne! Yeah!
15-05-2020T03:17:04,SageSaga,Yu Yu still holds up
15-05-2020T03:17:17,SageSaga,Escaflowne is a great example of an Isekai
15-05-2020T03:17:25,SageSaga,girl transported to a fantasy world
15-05-2020T03:18:12,SageSaga,how about Captain N The Game Master? XD
15-05-2020T03:18:48,SageSaga,or the D&D Cartoon!
15-05-2020T03:19:48,Dadrobit,"She's the viewport through which the story is mostly told, but the story really revolves around the guy and the political intrigues. I really need to watch it again."
15-05-2020T03:22:25,SageSaga,she was the goddess that put everything into motion
15-05-2020T03:22:28,Dadrobit,Been meaning to watch Perfect Blue again as well. Probably my favorite anime movie of all time.
15-05-2020T03:23:22,Dadrobit,Didn't the attack on the guys kingdom happen right before she was transported though?
15-05-2020T03:23:59,Dadrobit,And she became useful because she could detect the cloaked Mecha.
15-05-2020T03:24:25,SageSaga,she was his blessing- without her he would fail
15-05-2020T03:25:10,Dadrobit,There's a word I'm trying to remember that defines her position....
15-05-2020T03:25:11,SageSaga,she's also the vessel for the story to be told- you are supposed to see everything from her perspective-
15-05-2020T03:25:31,SageSaga,how she would see neither side as evil but each side saw eachother as monsters
15-05-2020T03:25:51,Dadrobit,MacGuffin! That's the one!
15-05-2020T03:26:46,SageSaga,i dont think so - she grows from the adventure- before she was transported she was thinking of suicide
15-05-2020T03:27:00,SageSaga,her adventure gave her an appreciation for life
15-05-2020T03:27:48,Dadrobit,"Was she? It's been forever. I just remember she was into tarot card reading, and she had a necklace that acted like a dowsing rod."
15-05-2020T03:28:12,Dadrobit,And she was of course the other side of the romantic interest.
15-05-2020T03:28:21,SageSaga,yeah
15-05-2020T03:28:30,SageSaga,you should watch the movie
15-05-2020T03:29:02,Dadrobit,I missed the movie. Been meaning to buy it as well for a watch.
15-05-2020T03:30:20,SageSaga,This is the theme song
15-05-2020T03:31:39,Dadrobit,"T-Mobile sucks, only hearing every 5th second. But I know it, Tom plays it all the time as well."
15-05-2020T03:31:58,SageSaga,looking for the official version
15-05-2020T03:32:02,SageSaga,this isnt it-
15-05-2020T03:32:58,Dadrobit,"The music of the show is probably my only gripe, and a small one at that. The music is great, don't get me wrong, but there is a TON of repetition that is just impossible to miss once you're in deep."
15-05-2020T03:33:51,SageSaga,it's in the draconic language so its all made up
15-05-2020T03:34:12,Dadrobit,"And the Escaflowne song is just comedic. They just repeat ""Escaflowne"" over and over again."
15-05-2020T03:34:14,SageSaga,i think i have the actual song on here- gonna try and find it
15-05-2020T03:35:23,Dadrobit,"Nah, not even the music with lyrics. The worst offender I think was the quiet interlude music. They just play the same song for every single quiet moment in the show."
15-05-2020T03:35:51,SageSaga,they didnt exactly have a big budget ^^
15-05-2020T03:36:27,Dadrobit,"""Memory of Fanellia"" that was the one."
15-05-2020T03:37:28,Dadrobit,"Like I said, it's not even a big gripe imo. Just something noticable enough to take me out of the zone ya know?"
15-05-2020T03:39:34,SageSaga,cant find it- oh well
15-05-2020T03:39:38,SageSaga,take care folks!
15-05-2020T03:39:41,SageSaga,im done!
15-05-2020T03:39:48,sunblaze,fair enough. nap well!
15-05-2020T03:39:50,BadFoMo,Good night.
15-05-2020T03:39:51,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Very well done Sage
15-05-2020T03:40:04,Dadrobit,"Right on, man. Thanks kindly for the stream!"
15-05-2020T03:40:10,SageSaga,if Picarto is willing- i shall be back at 3pm edt
15-05-2020T03:40:13,unsteddyphoenix,o/
15-05-2020T03:40:21,BadFoMo,Bye.
15-05-2020T03:40:27,ZRO4825,"Take care, Sage ^_^"
15-05-2020T03:40:39,SageSaga,ty! byeeee!
15-05-2020T03:40:45,AspiringNoodle,Night sage
15-05-2020T03:41:28,Dadrobit,"Have a good night, Sage. o/"
15-05-2020T03:46:00,SageSaga,oh jeez guys-
15-05-2020T03:46:10,SageSaga,yall still here? I just noticed something kinda funny-
15-05-2020T03:46:23,unsteddyphoenix,aw jeez!?
15-05-2020T03:46:50,SageSaga,"i got a new follower tonight- i was like ""oh neat- wait- this name looks familiar!"""
15-05-2020T03:47:36,SageSaga,and its that guy who messaged me like almost 2 months ago after i banned them here
15-05-2020T03:48:23,unsteddyphoenix,Lmao
15-05-2020T03:48:26,unsteddyphoenix,Are they still banned?
15-05-2020T03:48:35,SageSaga,heres his messages- and yes- he is still banned
15-05-2020T03:48:44,SageSaga,"""Why did u guys banned my I hate everyone of u guys I’m just going to ... see u later"""
15-05-2020T03:49:03,unsteddyphoenix,Ahhh...to be 12 again...
15-05-2020T03:49:04,SageSaga,"followed by this message - ""Don’t talk too me ever"""
15-05-2020T03:49:15,SageSaga,and then tonight- he follows me
15-05-2020T03:49:27,unsteddyphoenix,Oh shit. Well sounds like he's put his foot down
15-05-2020T03:50:35,SageSaga,"why would someone who never wants to talk to me and someone who ""hates me"" follow me?"
15-05-2020T03:50:53,SpazztasticKiwi,boobs
15-05-2020T03:51:08,unsteddyphoenix,Not a bad theory
15-05-2020T03:51:09,SageSaga,XD Like the art hate the artist?
15-05-2020T03:51:21,SpazztasticKiwi,that’s my guess
15-05-2020T03:51:22,unsteddyphoenix,Maybe he forgot
15-05-2020T03:52:55,Dadrobit,Was that the guy coming in demanding free arts?
15-05-2020T03:53:25,SageSaga,i think so
15-05-2020T03:53:56,Dadrobit,#Classy
15-05-2020T03:54:03,SageSaga,"he was like ""Can i get free art? Dont ban me"""
15-05-2020T03:54:09,SageSaga,so i banned him
15-05-2020T03:54:23,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I definitely remember that one."
15-05-2020T03:54:32,SageSaga,look if your begging includes dont punish me it means you know you are doing something wrong
15-05-2020T03:55:48,unsteddyphoenix,Haha
15-05-2020T03:56:08,unsteddyphoenix,"Well he asked ""why did u ban me"" so clearly he didnt"
15-05-2020T03:56:18,Dadrobit,"""please don't scream while I stab you, it makes me uncomfy."""
15-05-2020T03:56:20,unsteddyphoenix,He just cant work it out to this day poor thing
15-05-2020T03:57:00,SpazztasticKiwi,there’s a chance he would’ve kept on it if you just said no and then you could’ve banned him
15-05-2020T03:57:25,SpazztasticKiwi,would’ve made given the air he has
15-05-2020T03:57:31,SpazztasticKiwi,sense
15-05-2020T03:57:39,SageSaga,"its like a guy runs up to you holding a bag of money and a knife and is covered in blood and yells at you ""DONT CALL THE COPS!"" im calling the cops!"
15-05-2020T03:59:12,SpazztasticKiwi,I stay off all streams for what it’s come to
15-05-2020T03:59:16,unsteddyphoenix,"Well hold on, maybe something could be negotiated there"
15-05-2020T03:59:29,unsteddyphoenix,Could just be a *cough* misunderstanding
15-05-2020T03:59:53,Dadrobit,"Shit, he's coughing, stay away!"
15-05-2020T04:00:22,SageSaga,robit and i are on the same wavelength- stay away!
15-05-2020T04:01:54,Dadrobit,"Also, what do you mean, spazz?"
15-05-2020T04:02:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"last stream I was on, my message got removed despite the entire chat containing a running  incest joke"
15-05-2020T04:02:48,SpazztasticKiwi,and it was a youtube refrence
15-05-2020T04:03:10,SpazztasticKiwi,plus I’ve worked for the past 4 days straight going on my 5th so
15-05-2020T04:03:14,SageSaga,we dont take kindly to youtubers around here
15-05-2020T04:03:15,SpazztasticKiwi,I be busy anyway
15-05-2020T04:03:26,SageSaga,only familial love
15-05-2020T04:04:07,SpazztasticKiwi,"also, some....interesting characters as of late"
15-05-2020T04:04:10,SageSaga,Incest is the ultimate sign of your love for your family! *Said the creepiest person living in the mountains*
15-05-2020T04:04:24,SpazztasticKiwi,bless em they’re young but the sometimes spam...
15-05-2020T04:04:53,SpazztasticKiwi,half the time I wonder if I’m reading English
15-05-2020T04:05:28,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I've definitely noticed that. There's a revolving door of em though. They come and go."
15-05-2020T04:06:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"but yes, even after asking wtf with my situation, I got no answer so I’m off stream times for awhile"
15-05-2020T04:06:08,Dadrobit,"But spazz, don't you want to hear more about my obsession with Halo on the art stream?"
15-05-2020T04:06:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Lord knows I might say something that’s taken so I get banned
15-05-2020T04:07:35,SpazztasticKiwi,plus I had family over at the time that planned a whole trip out of town together on a day I worked when I was off the next day and had been off for the two days prior
15-05-2020T04:07:37,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I probably walk that tightrope a bit too much with poking fun at Kat and her fans. One of these days unsteddy's gonna snap."
15-05-2020T04:08:42,SpazztasticKiwi,"they left my sister out too, but she went to see them the next day when they found out - shocker - it was all closed and they couldn’t go"

15-05-2020T04:10:21,unsteddyphoenix,D:<
15-05-2020T04:10:31,Dadrobit,o/ Terra
15-05-2020T04:11:02,Dadrobit,"Awww, I've been reigning myself in a bit more for ya, unsteddy, I promise!"
15-05-2020T04:11:22,unsteddyphoenix,>:T
15-05-2020T04:12:21,Dadrobit,"I mean, I'll still make fun of all y'all for the ~amount~ of Kat getting pumped out, but that's different."
15-05-2020T04:13:14,Dadrobit,The principal of the thing and all that jazz
15-05-2020T04:14:19,unsteddyphoenix,Sorry shes so likable I guess
15-05-2020T04:14:38,Dadrobit,Apology accepted! <3
15-05-2020T04:14:55,unsteddyphoenix,>:S
15-05-2020T04:15:07,SpazztasticKiwi,multistream changed and messed up chat
15-05-2020T04:15:54,Dadrobit,"Which reminds me, you should give me more ideas unsteddy, your last one with Reni went through at warp speed."
15-05-2020T04:16:22,unsteddyphoenix,It was pretty cuuute
15-05-2020T04:16:34,Dadrobit,Hekkin precious
15-05-2020T04:16:44,SpazztasticKiwi,I have no ideas for my suggestion
15-05-2020T04:17:44,SpazztasticKiwi,I sorta had an idea for Nibbly family reunion but
15-05-2020T04:17:56,Dadrobit,"My current one with Maddie was super last second. Dunno how long it'll take. First vote it was 4th, second time it didn't get a single vote."
15-05-2020T04:18:59,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t see what good it does when I don’t bother with streams anymore either
15-05-2020T04:20:06,Dadrobit,shrugs
15-05-2020T04:20:13,Dadrobit,I wouldn't take it so hard
15-05-2020T04:20:25,SpazztasticKiwi,might swap out one of my ignored people with that ki3dran or whatever he’s called
15-05-2020T04:20:39,SpazztasticKiwi,at the very least
15-05-2020T04:21:12,Dadrobit,"Sage, ord, unsteddy, they've all removed shit I've posted and I'm still here more or less. They're all decent folks just trying to keep stuff on track in the chat."
15-05-2020T04:21:47,SpazztasticKiwi,but incest is ok while a youtube reference is too far?
15-05-2020T04:22:01,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
15-05-2020T04:22:11,SpazztasticKiwi,that’s what got me
15-05-2020T04:22:14,Dadrobit,"K13 probably won't last much longer, dude got multiple warnings thrown his way earlier."
15-05-2020T04:22:31,SpazztasticKiwi,the unfortunate part is streams land on times that I work
15-05-2020T04:22:36,Dadrobit,Incest that was brought up by sage right?
15-05-2020T04:22:48,SpazztasticKiwi,no this was Sunday
15-05-2020T04:23:06,Dadrobit,"Then I dunno, couldn't tell ya."
15-05-2020T04:23:07,SpazztasticKiwi,I skipped this stream - just got off work as usual
15-05-2020T04:24:20,TerraTheWizard,i can't catch sunday streams for the forseeable
15-05-2020T04:24:31,TerraTheWizard,because i gotta work at 3am on sundays so gotta sleep :ctwokinds-sadtrace2:
15-05-2020T04:24:37,TerraTheWizard,& mondyas
15-05-2020T04:25:10,Dadrobit,"Now that I work graves regularly again, I'll be missing at least the beginnings of them again."
15-05-2020T04:25:22,SpazztasticKiwi,yeah I was skipping streams for a week before that already because of the spammyness that had kinda picked up
15-05-2020T04:25:45,SpazztasticKiwi,not that it was noticeable
15-05-2020T04:25:49,SpazztasticKiwi,then the day I came back that happened
15-05-2020T04:26:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Sundays started to be days I worked on stuff if not spent watching youtube
15-05-2020T04:26:40,SpazztasticKiwi,so it’s back to that on my off days
15-05-2020T04:27:35,SpazztasticKiwi,tell me if this makes sense: they gave me an extra day this week but I was “over” by 45 so I had to take it off at lunch
15-05-2020T04:28:14,SpazztasticKiwi,"I did but that day, I ended up having to stay over 30 minutes to finish up and then the next day, stay an hour 20 to finish up"
15-05-2020T04:28:39,Dadrobit,"Yeah, now that my voice is back, weekends are gonna be vo time if I can get the work. So even less time for streams if I can't help it"
15-05-2020T04:29:19,Dadrobit,"Ahh, you are normally kept under 40 a week?"
15-05-2020T04:29:47,Dadrobit,32-35 or something like that?
15-05-2020T04:30:18,SpazztasticKiwi,they’re more picky about hours than a cat with toys
15-05-2020T04:30:55,SpazztasticKiwi,they’ll give or set you at a set of hours and that’s what they’ll fill you in for
15-05-2020T04:31:02,Dadrobit,"Yup, sounds like retail."
15-05-2020T04:31:13,SpazztasticKiwi,and heaven forbid you go near 40
15-05-2020T04:31:39,SpazztasticKiwi,they will hunt you down and send you home in some departments
15-05-2020T04:31:47,Dadrobit,"Meanwhile security is like, ""you only took two overtime shifts last period? You fuckin slacker."""
15-05-2020T04:31:58,SpazztasticKiwi,but I’m normally in the 20 hours range
15-05-2020T04:32:10,SpazztasticKiwi,sometimes 30s
15-05-2020T04:32:38,SpazztasticKiwi,but they don’t like anyone going over they’re given scheduled piece
15-05-2020T04:32:44,SpazztasticKiwi,their
15-05-2020T04:33:42,Dadrobit,Next week we have 200 hours of overtime. Shit is neverending.
15-05-2020T04:34:09,SpazztasticKiwi,you can’t have one or barely two people keep everything full run and have perfect punches
15-05-2020T04:35:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"speaking of, you think that whole thing effected your voice at all"
15-05-2020T04:35:21,Dadrobit,"They can demand it though. And when you don't deliver, you're fired and replaced in one to two days for your ""inability"" to complete your assigned tasks properly."
15-05-2020T04:35:50,SpazztasticKiwi,oh we complete it but by going over times
15-05-2020T04:35:53,Dadrobit,It absolutely has. The high end of my voice is completely gone
15-05-2020T04:36:11,Dadrobit,I'm all grindstone all the time now
15-05-2020T04:36:11,SpazztasticKiwi,no more soprano dadro
15-05-2020T04:36:23,SpazztasticKiwi,the opera will be devastated
15-05-2020T04:36:30,Dadrobit,Seriously.
15-05-2020T04:36:53,Dadrobit,Lucky I'm no longer in the choir
15-05-2020T04:38:12,SpazztasticKiwi,how will they go on
15-05-2020T04:38:24,SpazztasticKiwi,sooooooo
15-05-2020T04:38:39,SpazztasticKiwi,does this mean you’re throat to the grindstone
15-05-2020T04:38:42,SpazztasticKiwi,or tongue
15-05-2020T04:40:06,Dadrobit,"Picarto kicked me, sorry."
15-05-2020T04:40:21,Dadrobit,And it's the glottis. Glottis to the grindstone.
15-05-2020T04:40:53,SpazztasticKiwi,that sounds messy
15-05-2020T04:42:14,SpazztasticKiwi,"now I’m imagining a horror short that’s just a singer working away at a grindstone and as the camera gets closer/in focus, there she is sharpening her vocal chords for her next show"
15-05-2020T04:43:35,Dadrobit,I'm actually super excited to get back to it. The podcast group I'm a part of was/is totally understanding of what happened and I'm still on the team.
15-05-2020T04:44:17,SpazztasticKiwi,oh you gots sick? nEvEr SpEaK tO Us AgAiN
15-05-2020T04:44:29,SpazztasticKiwi,oh wait
15-05-2020T04:46:13,SpazztasticKiwi,you know I have work in 10 hours
15-05-2020T04:46:21,Dadrobit,They've been super kind about myself and my situation. I'm easily the least recognizable name on their roster and still getting work is actually awesome.
15-05-2020T04:47:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’d have to say ask teddy about Sunday since he’s the one that did it & can explain it with whatever explanation there is, idunno"
15-05-2020T04:48:01,SpazztasticKiwi,but yeah I don’t imagine why they wouldn’t be
15-05-2020T04:48:49,SpazztasticKiwi,some tones and voices are too good for particular jobs & it’s not like social distancing is an issue with voice work
15-05-2020T04:49:18,SpazztasticKiwi,can’t just swap out some people and “find another one”
15-05-2020T04:49:40,Dadrobit,Internet voice actors are a dime a dozen. They could replace me in under a week and probably at half the cost
15-05-2020T04:50:06,SpazztasticKiwi,now that’s I don’t feel valued talk
15-05-2020T04:51:01,Dadrobit,It's honesty. The best value a VA can have isn't their mic setup or their vocal talent. It's their ability to show up every time.
15-05-2020T04:51:03,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve been told my work voice is a different person
15-05-2020T04:51:10,SpazztasticKiwi,she is
15-05-2020T04:51:23,SpazztasticKiwi,girl’s faker than barbie
15-05-2020T04:52:10,SpazztasticKiwi,they kept me on the intercom the entire time I was at my old voice because so many people were just in love with how I sounded
15-05-2020T04:52:20,Dadrobit,Someone with a worse setup or worse chops will always get the part if the guy with the best everything just doesn't show up.
15-05-2020T04:52:36,SpazztasticKiwi,quite a bit of men in that group
15-05-2020T04:52:45,SpazztasticKiwi,yeah that makes sense
15-05-2020T04:53:34,SpazztasticKiwi,“where’s the understudy? Bob went bye bye”
15-05-2020T04:53:47,Dadrobit,That's the pitfall of working as an online VA. Your replacement if you don't do something perfect is only one tab over
15-05-2020T04:57:41,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m just happy today’s my last day
15-05-2020T04:58:00,Dadrobit,Enjoy!
15-05-2020T04:58:31,SpazztasticKiwi,be surprised if I don’t sleep all Sunday
15-05-2020T04:59:35,SpazztasticKiwi,the drag of the days is so bad it’s like it’s summer school
15-05-2020T04:59:54,Dadrobit,"By today, you mean the shift 10 hours from now right?"
15-05-2020T05:00:02,SpazztasticKiwi,yea
15-05-2020T05:00:23,Dadrobit,You have something else lined up?
15-05-2020T05:00:37,SpazztasticKiwi,work
15-05-2020T05:00:49,SpazztasticKiwi,then finally off after 5 days
15-05-2020T05:01:27,Dadrobit,"Ohhhh, when you said last day, I thought you meant you were at the end of your two weeks notice or something."
15-05-2020T05:02:26,SpazztasticKiwi,I will quit if they push me to it but I’ve got a bigger stubborn streak than they’ve liked to take on so far
15-05-2020T05:04:56,SpazztasticKiwi,flows gotten better here recently from what I can tell though
15-05-2020T05:05:37,SpazztasticKiwi,scheduling is awful if not worse because of hours changes but working stuff outs been easier
15-05-2020T05:06:55,SpazztasticKiwi,people are the garbage part - rude & demanding for the most part
15-05-2020T05:07:16,Dadrobit,"Man, I will never work in retail again. Overtime sucks in the moment, but the pay is just too good."
15-05-2020T05:07:28,SpazztasticKiwi,💵

15-05-2020T05:09:48,Dadrobit,3 extra days is like an extra $1k on my paycheck. Fuck working less than a 40hr week in that case lol.

15-05-2020T05:25:20,Azumachan,Good night Tom
15-05-2020T05:44:21,qwe304,So when is it going to be revealed that it was actually natani that killed Saria?
15-05-2020T06:04:23,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-RaineEep:
15-05-2020T06:06:54,TheSexyBeast,..so who put out the hit on Saria?
15-05-2020T06:08:33,TerraTheWizard,euchre
15-05-2020T06:17:43,TerraTheWizard,"but yeah, the issue with that is the assassin had long hair in a ponytail http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/408/"
15-05-2020T06:17:49,TerraTheWizard,and nat around that age had short hair
15-05-2020T06:43:51,TerraTheWizard,also
15-05-2020T06:44:27,TerraTheWizard,"nat looked right at the painting of saria and no hint of remembering who she was, you'd think they'd remember getting sent to kill a human who ended up protected by a templar"
15-05-2020T06:44:28,TerraTheWizard,http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/964/
15-05-2020T06:51:16,Avolendi,Pff. Rose glaring at Natani in that was is awesome xD
15-05-2020T08:03:20,Dadrobit,"The contract wasn't to kill Saria though, she was collateral damage. Trace was the real target."
15-05-2020T08:03:53,Dadrobit,"Wait, nevermind, I am a dumb dumb"
15-05-2020T08:04:19,Dadrobit,I totally misremembered that page.
15-05-2020T08:16:52,Dadrobit,"To be fair though, it might still be Natani. You're referencing TDM where Natani has short hair, sure, but Page 408 presumably happens at least a half a year later. Plenty of time to grow a medium ponytail."
15-05-2020T08:19:15,Dadrobit,"Also, it was one botched mission 6 years in the past, literally half a lifetime ago."
15-05-2020T08:19:34,Dadrobit,Very possible Saria's image was just forgotton.
15-05-2020T08:24:28,Dadrobit,"And it would be some undeniably spicy drama for D. Trace to take hold and recall Natani as ""The one who escaped,"" or ""The one I spared not knowing what they had done"" and it falls to Keith to stop (et al?) to stop him."
15-05-2020T08:24:55,Dadrobit,"Keith, (et al?) to stop*"
15-05-2020T08:33:20,TerraTheWizard,hmm
15-05-2020T08:36:23,Dadrobit,Also very on-brand for their operations to be successful fuckups.
15-05-2020T08:38:15,Dadrobit,"Side question, has http://2ks.wogcodex.com/ been down for a while? I feel like I was using it fairly recently. Hoping it's just under maintenance."
15-05-2020T08:40:20,TerraTheWizard,it was up yesterday
15-05-2020T08:40:31,TerraTheWizard,or the day before
15-05-2020T08:41:04,Dadrobit,"Imma check the forums, see if amenon posted something on it."
15-05-2020T08:41:55,Dadrobit,"Hm, nope, amenon hasn't posted since January actually."
15-05-2020T08:42:00,Dadrobit,Hope they're okay...
15-05-2020T10:39:01,NotNuhteneye,h
15-05-2020T10:52:57,TerraTheWizard,"""h""?"
15-05-2020T10:52:59,qwe304,The search engine is up for me
15-05-2020T10:53:14,qwe304,also if Trace found out that natany was the one that killed saria I doubt it would end well
15-05-2020T10:53:28,qwe304,"forgive the atrocious spelling, voice to text doesn't know how to work"
15-05-2020T10:58:54,CrimsonHelsing,"Doubtful that it was her or Zen, really. Despite the vague resemblance"

15-05-2020T15:02:59,SageSaga,what time is it for ya? XD
15-05-2020T15:03:20,Hogan,"10 PM, me taking the CET watch"
15-05-2020T15:03:46,SageSaga,ah so start at 9pm for ya
15-05-2020T15:04:21,Mihari,I'm having one of those weird days where it feels a lot later than it is.
15-05-2020T15:04:29,Mihari,So it's got me on whack.
15-05-2020T15:04:30,Hogan,"Yep, but I admit usually being busy otherwhere on Sat night, so I've missed out so far :-)"
15-05-2020T15:04:59,Hogan,"Oh? Here it feels a lot earlier, probably because its light outside so late..."
15-05-2020T15:05:36,SageSaga,let's see-
15-05-2020T15:05:51,SageSaga,on friday i stream from 9pm to around 4am
15-05-2020T15:06:24,Ordithus,"spring cleaning woot gonna run some junk outta here, be back in a bit"
15-05-2020T15:06:27,Hogan,Your time?
15-05-2020T15:06:30,SageSaga,that would be like 3am for you? Did i math right?
15-05-2020T15:07:18,Hogan,"9 PM your time... yeah, sounds like 3 AM for me :-)"
15-05-2020T15:07:59,Hogan,"Yep, my Picarto notification from Friday night says 3.02 AM"
15-05-2020T15:07:59,SageSaga,yeah- not a great time zone for my schedule XD
15-05-2020T15:08:30,Hogan,"Yeah, well, cant catch them all :-)"
15-05-2020T15:08:36,Hogan,Gotta enjoy it when I can
15-05-2020T15:35:47,SageSaga,i need a yosh booru
15-05-2020T15:36:37,BadFoMo,What's a booru?
15-05-2020T15:36:54,SageSaga,image site search thing
15-05-2020T15:37:04,SageSaga,like an image board
15-05-2020T15:37:12,SageSaga,safebooru is one
15-05-2020T15:37:15,BadFoMo,Thanks.
15-05-2020T15:37:26,Grip,Hard to find stuff made easy.
15-05-2020T15:38:08,SageSaga,yeah inbetween strokes on the page im looking through my patreon images and - its sloooow
15-05-2020T15:38:15,SageSaga,and the old old pictures have no tags
15-05-2020T15:38:21,SageSaga,because tags were added later
15-05-2020T15:38:36,Grip,"Right, no tags is a pain/"
15-05-2020T15:40:10,Mihari,Those booru sites are a pain to setup.
15-05-2020T15:40:27,SageSaga,is there a better option?
15-05-2020T15:40:40,ZRO4825,Tags on each page with the characters that're on them?
15-05-2020T15:40:53,ZRO4825,"Wait, you have that mostly I think :thinking:"
15-05-2020T15:41:03,SageSaga,im talking about for my patreon art
15-05-2020T15:41:14,Mihari,"Well, could do a gallery site in wordpress, it does support tags, but it downright won't be as clean or fast as a booru would be to navigate."
15-05-2020T15:41:28,ZRO4825,"Oh, for Patreon art, that'd be a great idea."
15-05-2020T15:41:44,ZRO4825,Cuz trying to navigate Patreon back past a certain point is just hell.
15-05-2020T15:42:01,ZRO4825,"Seriously, who thought continuously auto-scrolling forever back through YEARS of content was a good idea?"
15-05-2020T15:43:08,SageSaga,thats why they added tags- but even then- yeeeeah
15-05-2020T15:43:32,ZRO4825,"It's still hell even with those depending on how often an artist updates, lol"
15-05-2020T15:44:34,SageSaga,at least the new posts show like all the images in a thread as a preview
15-05-2020T15:47:19,SageSaga,lulz
15-05-2020T15:47:28,SageSaga,old Nyna concept pictures where she had boobs
15-05-2020T15:47:50,ZRO4825,:o
15-05-2020T15:47:58,ZRO4825,A booby Nyna?
15-05-2020T15:48:45,SageSaga,never again (unless she wears that swim suit)
15-05-2020T15:48:46,BadFoMo,Its a trap!
15-05-2020T15:48:53,ZRO4825,XD I love that swimsuit.
15-05-2020T15:49:01,ZRO4825,Put it on Relm! It does nothing. o_o
15-05-2020T15:49:07,SageSaga,of course you do...
15-05-2020T15:49:09,ZRO4825,Gives her a reduction somehow.
15-05-2020T15:49:22,SageSaga,nope
15-05-2020T15:49:48,ZRO4825,Would be funny though. :P
15-05-2020T15:50:06,SageSaga,i think it's funny enough that it doesnt seem to do anything
15-05-2020T15:50:33,ZRO4825,"True, true. Either way. Either it does nothing. Or it gives her a reduction like she's somehow broken the limits of the game. :rofl:"
15-05-2020T16:01:02,SageSaga,yall can tell the difference in when i use touch to move around the screen and when i use the navi right?
15-05-2020T16:04:48,ZRO4825,"I'm...not certain, tbh, lol"
15-05-2020T16:05:42,SageSaga,watch
15-05-2020T16:06:26,SageSaga,see?
15-05-2020T16:06:44,SageSaga,also- wow the delay right now for me is next to nada
15-05-2020T16:07:10,SageSaga,lol i have only a 3-4 second delay- never seen it that fast before

15-05-2020T16:13:39,IronHorseComics,what madness is this?
15-05-2020T16:13:54,ShamusTheFox,How was the D & D?
15-05-2020T16:14:44,SageSaga,D&D is in 2 hours and 45 minutes
15-05-2020T16:15:08,IronHorseComics,I misread that at first and thought your session was that short
15-05-2020T16:15:18,ShamusTheFox,"Ah, gotcha gotcha. Is it streamed? I would like to watch if possible."
15-05-2020T16:15:50,SageSaga,nope- i wouldnt do that to my poor friends
15-05-2020T16:15:58,ZRO4825,lol
15-05-2020T16:16:08,ZRO4825,He says this like 3/4 of them aren't already artists that stream anyway. :P
15-05-2020T16:16:25,ShamusTheFox,*chuckles* Ah well...I hope to hear tales of your adventures nevertheless!
15-05-2020T16:17:12,ZRO4825,We usually get a story or two out of their sessions every couple weeks. :P
15-05-2020T16:17:27,SageSaga,only half of the players stream
15-05-2020T16:18:11,Mihari,"I mean I could stream, but being a twitch streamer doesn't really appeal to me. XD"
15-05-2020T16:18:44,Mihari,"I tend to prefer immersion with my games, and I'd never get that if I streamed. You have to pay attention to your audience to succeed."
15-05-2020T16:19:05,ShamusTheFox,I want to game with my friends. but one of them just got back from a hospital stint last week and got out on Wednesday. Can postpone gaming until my friend has a chance to properly recuperate.
15-05-2020T16:19:06,Mihari,Or just being a revealing outfit or something...
15-05-2020T16:19:07,Hogan,"Some people stream, some people watch... I'm a watcher :-)"

15-05-2020T16:19:35,IronHorseComics,you could Mihari
15-05-2020T16:19:44,IronHorseComics,but then Twitch would delete your channel
15-05-2020T16:19:47,Ordithus,Yee it's not like every moment of your existence needs to be online in front of people anyways
15-05-2020T16:19:56,IronHorseComics,because they're kinda dicks
15-05-2020T16:19:58,Mihari,I didn't mean THAT revealing.
15-05-2020T16:20:14,IronHorseComics,you don't even have to go that far
15-05-2020T16:20:16,Mihari,"You can dress enough to be appealing, but still not be slutty."
15-05-2020T16:20:31,SageSaga,you can go body paint as your character
15-05-2020T16:20:41,IronHorseComics,there's an idea
15-05-2020T16:21:06,Mihari,The girls that usually get banned are ones that have their camera block most of the game footage
15-05-2020T16:21:29,Hogan,... I watch the wrong games I see...
15-05-2020T16:21:48,Mihari,"If you're watching them, it just means they haven't been banned and for those reasons XD"
15-05-2020T16:23:01,IronHorseComics,haven't been banned YET
15-05-2020T16:23:03,ShamusTheFox,I just enjoy the camaraderie of a game. It's entertaining in real time to see how people handle situations and come up with solutions.
15-05-2020T16:23:11,Mihari,sighs...
15-05-2020T16:23:26,IronHorseComics,picarto would probably be cooler about it though
15-05-2020T16:23:29,SageSaga,hope ya enjoy silence and me explaining things over again
15-05-2020T16:23:41,Ordithus,sounds like dnd :P
15-05-2020T16:24:14,ShamusTheFox,"I have some friends that were doing a D & D series called Dungeons and Draggets. It was very entertaining, but was put on hold for a next season, and quarantine is delaying that."
15-05-2020T16:24:44,IronHorseComics,"so, top tip on Mtn Dew Frost Bite... avoid"
15-05-2020T16:24:45,Mihari,Streaming our game wouldn't work for a great many reasons.
15-05-2020T16:25:09,ShamusTheFox,@Mihari And that's fair.
15-05-2020T16:25:27,IronHorseComics,"oh I don't know, I've been on a tabletop stream before. There weren't a lot of people watching but it was still fun as hell"
15-05-2020T16:25:39,BadFoMo,What would thoes reasons be?
15-05-2020T16:25:44,IronHorseComics,I say A stream but it was a whole series
15-05-2020T16:25:57,Mihari,Lots of dead air would be the biggest reason.
15-05-2020T16:26:41,Mihari,Nothing would kill a stream more than when we have one of our usual random ninja AFK's and we are stuck waiting.
15-05-2020T16:26:51,SageSaga,none of the players are as experienced as i am at quickly reacting and coming up with ideas
15-05-2020T16:26:55,ZRO4825,lol
15-05-2020T16:26:57,BadFoMo,Ah.
15-05-2020T16:27:08,SageSaga,so that also causes people to spend a lot of time thinking about what to say and do
15-05-2020T16:27:11,Ordithus,Hmm I wouldn't be so out of place haha
15-05-2020T16:27:40,BadFoMo,YouTube highlight reel time!
15-05-2020T16:27:52,Ordithus,:eyes: Kaylin looks so damn good in that first panel
15-05-2020T16:27:55,ShamusTheFox,Sometimes it takes a little whe for a group to gel and find their niche.
15-05-2020T16:28:02,ShamusTheFox,While
15-05-2020T16:28:04,SageSaga,"there's 2 things that happen a lot - one - I say something as a character and the party goes - ""Oh no it's a smart NPC"" or 2 ""Oh no- it's an idiot"""
15-05-2020T16:28:06,Mihari,We've been doing this for years... XD
15-05-2020T16:28:17,IronHorseComics,"ah, yeah I was playing with experienced players, it was my first time playing any tabletop RPG and I thought I did alright"
15-05-2020T16:28:20,Mihari,I think it's actually gotten worse XD
15-05-2020T16:28:31,ShamusTheFox,Hee hee!
15-05-2020T16:29:32,IronHorseComics,"I ended up with the nickname of that campaign ""Nascitur the Kill Stealer!"""
15-05-2020T16:29:41,SageSaga,hard to talk about it since yall know the players- i love em all but one in particular has a lot of issues sometimes that can make it frustrating
15-05-2020T16:30:54,Ordithus,great now everyone is gonna wonder who that is
15-05-2020T16:31:01,Mihari,Another big issue with streaming is actually me.
15-05-2020T16:31:06,ShamusTheFox,"Nah, not me."
15-05-2020T16:31:44,Ordithus,"My dnd group has a few players who have been playing together for 20 years, so they tend to keep something going at all times"
15-05-2020T16:31:45,ShamusTheFox,I've been in enough groups to know each one is uniqur and has their own dynamic.
15-05-2020T16:32:05,Ordithus,even if it is just spirited discussion of rules :D
15-05-2020T16:32:58,SageSaga,i am super happy with how the game is going so far though
15-05-2020T16:33:11,ShamusTheFox,"""I attempt to brofist the monster."" ""Brofist?"" ""Yeah, you know, touch knuckles."""
15-05-2020T16:33:47,Mihari,chuckles.
15-05-2020T16:33:50,Mihari,That nat 1...
15-05-2020T16:33:54,Mihari,It was perfect.
15-05-2020T16:34:33,SageSaga,little catfolk drinking a hard liquor
15-05-2020T16:34:53,ShamusTheFox,I remember playing Rise of the Rune Lords with a critical hit / fumble deck. It caused some hilarity.
15-05-2020T16:35:04,IronHorseComics,so I have a story from that campaign
15-05-2020T16:35:14,ShamusTheFox,God I love Chrono Cross music.
15-05-2020T16:35:37,Hogan,"Allright, time for the CET-crew to sign off for tonight."
15-05-2020T16:35:57,BadFoMo,Good night?
15-05-2020T16:35:58,ShamusTheFox,Take care!
15-05-2020T16:36:09,Hogan,"Thanks for the company everyone, and thanks for the entertainment Sage. Nice finally catching your stream :-)"
15-05-2020T16:36:47,Ordithus,bye hogan
15-05-2020T16:37:01,SageSaga,take care!
15-05-2020T16:37:09,ShamusTheFox,"One of our players was a druid, and had a bear companion."
15-05-2020T16:37:15,ShamusTheFox,That poor bear.
15-05-2020T16:37:33,IronHorseComics,"so for context, we were trying to prove to the king that darkling spies were in the city, which was like a big gateway to the rest of the continent, to open up a path for a massive hoard to take over the world."
15-05-2020T16:37:43,ShamusTheFox,The bear never died. It just probably wished it was dead.
15-05-2020T16:38:00,ShamusTheFox,*listens*
15-05-2020T16:39:23,IronHorseComics,"So, we found that the best way to draw the darkling spies out, was to participate in gladiatorial tournament. I was actually the newcomer for that group so I stayed mostly in the stands to keep an eye out. I was a catman paladin..."
15-05-2020T16:40:03,IronHorseComics,a catman paladin that worshiped a water god and my holy item was a trident that had water and ice magic.
15-05-2020T16:40:35,ShamusTheFox,OK OK...
15-05-2020T16:41:35,IronHorseComics,"So anyway as the tournament goes on I catch two orcs preparing to storm the arena and I made my way over there. Meanwhile the rest of my team was fighting this other team that included a totally cool big Russian guy, a serial killer..."
15-05-2020T16:42:43,SageSaga,how do you have a russian guy in a fantasy world? is this a fantasy place with Russia?
15-05-2020T16:42:55,IronHorseComics,that's just how the GM acted him
15-05-2020T16:43:03,IronHorseComics,he just sounded Russian
15-05-2020T16:43:37,SageSaga,so hes a big strong guy that has a Russian style accent
15-05-2020T16:43:48,IronHorseComics,yeah pretty much
15-05-2020T16:44:19,SageSaga,ok - continue your fantasy Soviet world story
15-05-2020T16:44:25,IronHorseComics,we actually came back later and found himself as a slave even though he was strong enough to leave at any time and the slavers totally wouldn't be able to stop him
15-05-2020T16:45:15,IronHorseComics,"anyway there were a couple of other mercs, I can't remember. They manage to defeat someone and then when the orcs rush the area I manage to jump in and kill one, the other orc totally abandons him and then one of mercs takes out this amulet that's..."
15-05-2020T16:46:05,SageSaga,a screaming skull that wails a banshee scream?
15-05-2020T16:46:36,Mihari,Sounds cool.
15-05-2020T16:46:38,IronHorseComics,"no, it was a homebrew world played with microlite"
15-05-2020T16:46:55,SageSaga,i dont see how that matters
15-05-2020T16:47:12,Mihari,"Was the skull flaming, preferably blue flames? :D"
15-05-2020T16:47:25,ShamusTheFox,Why blue?
15-05-2020T16:47:34,Mihari,Going with the banshee theme... I dunno
15-05-2020T16:47:46,SageSaga,green flames better
15-05-2020T16:47:57,Mihari,"Yah, but I like blue, what can I say..."
15-05-2020T16:48:11,IronHorseComics,"darkling in origin and it lets him grow super big and all that jazz. Well, the leader of our group, a birdman fighter, had this demon possessed flail (the demon himself was a party demon and I think his name was Partius Maximus) and well..."
15-05-2020T16:48:15,Mihari,Perfect scenario is purple tho...
15-05-2020T16:48:19,Mihari,Sexy flames!
15-05-2020T16:48:28,ShamusTheFox,I like purple.
15-05-2020T16:49:08,ShamusTheFox,Sounds like a pretty mid to high level scenario with all the magic gear.
15-05-2020T16:49:10,SageSaga,"so he pulls out an amulet and a staff falls from the moon and you hear ""MAKE MY MONSTER GROW!"""
15-05-2020T16:49:23,SageSaga,or is it just like 1 size category up?
15-05-2020T16:49:44,IronHorseComics,it was closer to the first one
15-05-2020T16:49:59,SageSaga,so you had to fight a Kaiju monster
15-05-2020T16:50:10,SageSaga,see your should have said that
15-05-2020T16:50:15,IronHorseComics,"not kaiju sized, he still fit inside the arena just fine"
15-05-2020T16:50:31,SageSaga,so he was like one or two size catagories max
15-05-2020T16:50:45,IronHorseComics,"I'd say three or four, but yeah"
15-05-2020T16:50:50,ZRO4825,"Damnit, Sage. Fuckin Rita Repulsa reference. :joy: Bout snorted my tea."
15-05-2020T16:50:58,SageSaga,4 and your talking as big as an arena
15-05-2020T16:51:28,IronHorseComics,"anyway our fighter got himself possessed by the demon to make himself grow to equal size! I meanwhile run in, stab the big monster, almost kill him and then use a move call ""Wrath of the Divine"" which manifested a giant iceberg that kills him..."
15-05-2020T16:52:12,IronHorseComics,"our fighter was a bit surprised looked at the party demon in his head and went. ""Well, shit, looks like I just wasted your time, as well as my time and pretty much everyone's time"""
15-05-2020T16:53:29,IronHorseComics,"the demon was like ""Yeah, it's all good bro"" and then leaves the body of our fighter back into the flail and he returns to normal... he was already in rough shape and now he kinda needed to wait for a while in a hospital"
15-05-2020T16:53:32,SageSaga,"Wrath of the Titanic! ""Dont you mean wrath of the titan?"" ""NOPE!"""
15-05-2020T16:53:59,IronHorseComics,"but he ended up with the crown and the love and that's how I got the name ""Nascitur the Kill Stealer"""
15-05-2020T16:54:12,ShamusTheFox,"Dammit Sage, now I want a spell that drops an ocean liner on an enemy."
15-05-2020T16:54:17,IronHorseComics,it was all pretty funny
15-05-2020T16:55:23,IronHorseComics,that whole campaign was funny
15-05-2020T16:56:00,ShamusTheFox,It's good to know if the campaign you're in is going to be a serious one or a lighthearted one.
15-05-2020T16:57:33,IronHorseComics,first group mission I was in with them we were going into a treasure room with a sketchy elf wizard and we ended up having to fight a lich wizard and some of his summons.
15-05-2020T16:57:48,ShamusTheFox,"I tried Shadowrun for a while and I kinda liked it. Much more gritty than I'm used to, but still had fun and some genuinely funny moments."
15-05-2020T16:58:31,IronHorseComics,"when his head first came off it started floating around the room and he was like ""Now then, I need a new body, which one of you is the most intelligent?"""
15-05-2020T16:59:04,IronHorseComics,"our dwarf paladin goes ""The smartest one here is Doomfluff, you can't have Doomfluff!"""
15-05-2020T16:59:51,IronHorseComics,Doomfluff was a young griffin that was a traveling companion for our cat lady ranger
15-05-2020T17:01:46,funnyman42,~<3
15-05-2020T17:05:13,IronHorseComics,who later on shot an arrow at the lich's mouth and stuck him into the wall
15-05-2020T17:05:54,SageSaga,he then cast imprisonment on her and sent her to the core of the earth
15-05-2020T17:06:42,IronHorseComics,"can't chant your spells when you can't talk, can you?"
15-05-2020T17:06:50,SageSaga,heck yeah you can
15-05-2020T17:06:59,ShamusTheFox,Silent Spell
15-05-2020T17:07:16,ShamusTheFox,It's a feat in some versions
15-05-2020T17:07:57,SageSaga,how does a lich talk in the first place? They dont have lungs- they dont need to move their mouth or tongue if they even have one to speak
15-05-2020T17:08:37,Mihari,Further more arrow that sticks to the wall? If I was undead I'd just pull my head toward and off it XD
15-05-2020T17:08:54,SageSaga,or have protection from arrows up in the first place
15-05-2020T17:08:55,Ordithus,the undead are notoriously difficult to re-dead
15-05-2020T17:09:06,IronHorseComics,"he used to be a wizard and his head was already detached, it was the head that was stuck to the wall while the body was fighting our fighter"
15-05-2020T17:09:18,SageSaga,i think what we are saying is- your lich is a beach.
15-05-2020T17:09:26,SageSaga,I dont curse so ya gotta stick with beach
15-05-2020T17:09:39,Mihari,power word kill the lot of you.
15-05-2020T17:09:41,IronHorseComics,"yeah, he pretty much was. He was funny but still"
15-05-2020T17:10:25,SageSaga,"Time Stop - Power Word Kill, Power Word Stun, Circle of Death, Delayed Blast Fireball"
15-05-2020T17:11:01,RimaDraws,hey sorry i'm late...
15-05-2020T17:11:05,SageSaga,yo Rima
15-05-2020T17:11:06,IronHorseComics,hey Rima
15-05-2020T17:11:10,BadFoMo,Yo.
15-05-2020T17:11:12,Mihari,"Unforgivable, Rima! XD"
15-05-2020T17:11:18,RimaDraws,i slept three hours for a nap.
15-05-2020T17:11:23,Mihari,Good reason
15-05-2020T17:11:23,RimaDraws,i dozed off last night
15-05-2020T17:11:40,IronHorseComics,"actually now that I think of it, he may have been a demi-lich"
15-05-2020T17:11:50,Ordithus,hi rima!
15-05-2020T17:11:51,RimaDraws,but this looks great sage <3
15-05-2020T17:11:53,SageSaga,so yall should be way more dead
15-05-2020T17:11:54,RimaDraws,hi ord <3
15-05-2020T17:12:01,SageSaga,Demi liches are waaaay worse
15-05-2020T17:12:21,IronHorseComics,"*shrug* I dunno, he just sucked at his job"
15-05-2020T17:12:42,SageSaga,im sorry sir but lich is more of a lifestyle not a job
15-05-2020T17:12:45,IronHorseComics,plus this was years ago so I don't remember off the top of my head
15-05-2020T17:13:19,IronHorseComics,he could have just been an undead wizard for all I know
15-05-2020T17:13:40,IronHorseComics,the sessions are on youtube so I could go back and check
15-05-2020T17:13:43,SageSaga,part of that- sacrificing souls to your phylactery to maintain your regenerative abilities is not a job
15-05-2020T17:14:39,SageSaga,last week our party ran into a Lich
15-05-2020T17:14:55,SageSaga,they had zero chance of killing it
15-05-2020T17:14:57,Werewing,Did they impologize for knocking them over?
15-05-2020T17:15:03,Werewing,apologize*
15-05-2020T17:15:17,SageSaga,they are still alive so they mus
15-05-2020T17:15:19,SageSaga,t
15-05-2020T17:15:27,ShamusTheFox,"It must be really difficult to hide becoming a lich, given thay you have to research forbidden knowledge and all that. ""Do you have a book on how to make a phylactery?"" ""Why would you want to know? ""...no reason..."""
15-05-2020T17:16:15,Werewing,"I think they usually get their knowledge from other liches, or evil beings."
15-05-2020T17:16:57,SageSaga,Liches arent into sharing power
15-05-2020T17:17:14,Werewing,Never said it was willing.
15-05-2020T17:17:46,ShamusTheFox,You probably have to make one heck of a pitch. Most wouldn't want to raise uo a potential rival for power unless there was something significant to gain.
15-05-2020T17:17:56,ShamusTheFox,raise up
15-05-2020T17:18:03,Werewing,It could also be a inflicted status. Like Zeus granting Tithonus immortality.
15-05-2020T17:18:19,SageSaga,if a lich gives you a ritual to become a lich you can bet its not gonna turn you into a lich
15-05-2020T17:18:27,Werewing,"I was specifically thinking, kill the old lich, raid library or compel them to tell you."
15-05-2020T17:18:44,Werewing,There are spells for talking to the unwilling.
15-05-2020T17:19:08,SageSaga,heck one of the first things a lich does after becoming a lich is to destroy everything from the ritual except what he needs to continue
15-05-2020T17:21:40,ShamusTheFox,Not exactly a high profile job. Live forever? Sure. Massive power? OK. Approval from your peers? Miiiiight be asking for a bit much.
15-05-2020T17:21:41,SageSaga,shocked none of you asked how they survived the lich
15-05-2020T17:21:51,Werewing,"And while rivals could be a problem, immortal (thinking) underlings could be useful to a would be Lich-King."
15-05-2020T17:22:04,Werewing,"I mean, you are talking a tabletop game, right? Doesn"
15-05-2020T17:22:32,SageSaga,"""All my peers are dead- except Johnny, right Johnny?"" ""uuuurrrrrggggg"" ""Good Johnny, keep sweeping my zombie friend"""
15-05-2020T17:22:35,Werewing,'t it boil down to smack the Lich or their phylactery until it yields? They could also have someone woo the lich.
15-05-2020T17:23:00,ShamusTheFox,"""How did they survive the lich?"" He asks, waiting for the tale..."
15-05-2020T17:23:27,SageSaga,a red dragon swooped in - drew out his greatsword and smashed the lich with it
15-05-2020T17:23:50,ShamusTheFox,Fortuitous!
15-05-2020T17:23:54,Ordithus,deus ex dragona
15-05-2020T17:24:13,SageSaga,then a black dragon came in and reprimanded the red dragon and then apologized for the idiocy of his ward and they left
15-05-2020T17:24:38,ShamusTheFox,"""Well, that was a thing..."""
15-05-2020T17:24:54,SageSaga,"while Mihari's character fumed and the other characters were like ""Wait- i thought Red and Black dragons were the evil ones?"""
15-05-2020T17:25:05,Werewing,Sounds like something Sage would do.
15-05-2020T17:25:45,ShamusTheFox,You can be evil and still have manners.
15-05-2020T17:26:01,Werewing,"Yes, that is what most Ordered Evil is about."
15-05-2020T17:26:04,IronHorseComics,"yeah it was a demilich, he had a silver sword stuck in his chest holding him to a chair for centuries and he used to be a wizard before paladins stabbed him and stuck him to said chair"
15-05-2020T17:26:25,SageSaga,nah that was the introduction to Dragons of Eberron - there is no innately evil creatures in Eberron
15-05-2020T17:27:20,ShamusTheFox,So the Lich could have been a buddy?
15-05-2020T17:27:31,SageSaga,yes
15-05-2020T17:27:35,SageSaga,but he was clearly not
15-05-2020T17:27:58,SageSaga,there are good liches in Eberron though
15-05-2020T17:28:08,SageSaga,heck a good portion of the elven people are -
15-05-2020T17:28:17,ShamusTheFox,"""Hey guys! Just being undead up in here. Would you like a lemonade? Oh, hey, a dragon! How are you mister-"" *smacked with sword*"
15-05-2020T17:29:02,SageSaga,brb i need to take some allergy meds
15-05-2020T17:29:32,ShamusTheFox,"Allergic to my commentary, I see! (jk)"
15-05-2020T17:31:20,ShamusTheFox,"Also, I am not sure I like the idea of dragons flying around smacking people with swords out of the blue. Seems like a very obvious safety hazard."
15-05-2020T17:31:47,ShamusTheFox,I would be walking around with my head constantly scanning the sky.
15-05-2020T17:32:21,Werewing,I think that is how most Fantasy Worlds work.
15-05-2020T17:32:38,Werewing,"So many flying, magical, dangerous creatures, everyone must constantly be on edge."
15-05-2020T17:33:30,Werewing,"If it isn't a Dragon, it is a Gryphon, if it isn't a Gryphon, it is a reckless Mage, if not that, an Artificer."
15-05-2020T17:33:48,ShamusTheFox,"Griffins, Hippogryfs, Dragons, Rocs, all with huge chips on their shoulders."
15-05-2020T17:34:18,Werewing,"And that's only the tip of iceberg. What about ghosts, demons, angels, abberations!"
15-05-2020T17:35:21,ShamusTheFox,"Wyverns, Chimera, it's a madhouse!"
15-05-2020T17:36:21,Werewing,It almost makes sense why Dwarves and Gnomes stay underground all the time.
15-05-2020T17:36:34,ShamusTheFox,"Oh wait, is it Chimera or Manticores that can fly?"
15-05-2020T17:36:38,SageSaga,back
15-05-2020T17:36:50,BadFoMo,Yo.
15-05-2020T17:36:54,Werewing,"Depending on the setting and homebrew, either or both can."
15-05-2020T17:36:55,ShamusTheFox,Welcome back!
15-05-2020T17:41:44,ShamusTheFox,"One of my favorite D & D moments...playing a Tengu Ranger, I was trying to find a specific location in an enemy stronghold. I goofed and got noticed by a couple of orc guards."
15-05-2020T17:43:07,ShamusTheFox,"Being that I wasn't human, I dropped the name of someone I had heard about in passing and pretended I was lost and looking for the cafeteria. Rolled a nat 19 on my bluff and managed to avoid a conflict."
15-05-2020T17:43:51,ShamusTheFox,"Not a huge story, but I was glad I could think on my feet."
15-05-2020T17:44:17,RimaDraws,omg i just got my cosplay make up in. excited

15-05-2020T18:25:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom rising makes it sound like the dude comes out of a coffin
15-05-2020T18:57:24,RimaDraws,lol
15-05-2020T19:56:56,CrRAR,Whole other mythical creature if reports of helping the blind to see and/or walks on water.
15-05-2020T20:42:35,RimaDraws,finally got my red lip gloss for the cosplay i want to do. i picked the lighter red when i couldn't decide
15-05-2020T20:50:08,SpazztasticKiwi,my dresses that I WAS bringing to pittsburgh showed up yesterday
15-05-2020T20:50:44,SpazztasticKiwi,but I still had to fashion some shoes and hair band for it anyway
15-05-2020T20:54:19,RimaDraws,oooh
15-05-2020T22:13:26,NotNuhteneye,it's been so long since i got a haircut the short hair on side of my head has decided to become a horn
15-05-2020T22:25:48,AspiringNoodle,It's getting super uncomfortable at work now :/
15-05-2020T22:26:07,AspiringNoodle,"Long hair making me extra hot when combined with the mask, and it's also making it easier for my glasses to fall off"
15-05-2020T22:27:21,RimaDraws,yea i know that feeling
15-05-2020T22:28:13,AspiringNoodle,But today was just too much
15-05-2020T22:28:35,AspiringNoodle,That car wash NEVER works right
15-05-2020T22:28:43,AspiringNoodle,"If it's not one thing, it's another."
15-05-2020T22:29:08,AspiringNoodle,"So, I'm super uncomfortable, having to make sure my glasses don't fall of my face and break constantly"
15-05-2020T22:29:37,AspiringNoodle,"Try and do an impossibly large amount of tasks, handle special situations because I'm the more experienced employee"
15-05-2020T22:29:43,AspiringNoodle,I'm sick of it
15-05-2020T22:31:53,AspiringNoodle,Guess I'll throw in doing other peoples jobs and cleaning up after coworkers while I'm at it.
15-05-2020T22:34:57,AspiringNoodle,"Rima, you said you had some jackass coworkers, right?"
15-05-2020T22:41:18,RimaDraws,i am not gonna bring that up
15-05-2020T22:44:13,NotNuhteneye,i get more annoyed when i fog up my glasses with my breath
15-05-2020T22:46:09,AspiringNoodle,"Oh, that's extra fun in the cooler / freezer"
15-05-2020T22:56:20,AspiringNoodle,"Anyways, I was working wwith my one coworker who's gonna be retrained starting next week"
15-05-2020T22:56:41,AspiringNoodle,"Because yes, apparently that were that many complaints about his inactivity / antics"
15-05-2020T23:01:06,JojoGD,Hi
15-05-2020T23:44:20,SpazztasticKiwi,where’s that German teapot I got questions
15-05-2020T23:47:57,AspiringNoodle,Access to that particular SCP requires level-4 clearance and the approval of no less than 3 O5 members
15-05-2020T23:48:02,AspiringNoodle,:upside_down:
15-05-2020T23:54:57,BlackjackSec99,which one was the vending machine?
15-05-2020T23:58:40,AspiringNoodle,"uuuuuuh, there's two"
15-05-2020T23:59:19,BlackjackSec99,the one in the employee lounge
15-05-2020T23:59:22,AspiringNoodle,"One is SCP-294, which looks like a coffee vending machine, and can dispense anything that's capable of liquid form in a liquid form"
15-05-2020T23:59:30,BlackjackSec99,thats the one
15-05-2020T23:59:31,BlackjackSec99,!
15-05-2020T23:59:37,AspiringNoodle,"Awww, but 261 is much more fun :D"
