09-09-2020T08:26:30,Dadrobit,Made him make a cameo video where Arpaio congratulates furries for hosting a convention for animal lovers
09-09-2020T08:27:13,Dadrobit,Also has him mention Kelly Townsend who's a state Rep who got a crash course in furries a few years back and ended up getting her own fursona out of it.
09-09-2020T08:27:41,Dadrobit,The video itself though is the stuff of literal nightmares and is circulating on the morning radio shows right now
09-09-2020T09:23:14,CrimsonQuill,I still don't know how to count a person as a 'furry' or not...there are so many different definitions.
09-09-2020T09:23:47,CrimsonQuill,"Some people say that one's a furry if they so much as like anthropomorphic characters, others say it's only for some of the most extreme in the fandom..,"

09-09-2020T19:29:56,CrRAR,yeah 'net jacket' I think they call it officially
09-09-2020T19:30:16,Dadrobit,"Don't know how power cycling could kill an HDMI port on a monitor, but here we are."
09-09-2020T19:30:48,Dadrobit,I guess I can just order a meter long DP cable and just call it a day.
09-09-2020T19:31:01,CrRAR,"They're trying to confuse everyone, just when we all thought it was okay to tun it off/on again"
09-09-2020T19:31:06,CrRAR,NOOOOOO
09-09-2020T19:31:42,CrRAR,"""These tech people are getting TOO smart thinking they know how to fix stuff"""
09-09-2020T19:31:50,CrRAR,"""We'll show them"""

09-09-2020T19:32:51,AspiringNoodle,I had a power cycle kill my ssd once
09-09-2020T19:33:05,CrRAR,"Some monitors do have F/W updates, I shit you not"
09-09-2020T19:33:48,AspiringNoodle,"Left to go see a movie, came back and when I went to turn my pc on from sleep, it was unresponsive"
09-09-2020T19:33:55,AspiringNoodle,"When I rebooted the computer, it couldn't detect the ssd"
09-09-2020T19:34:04,CrRAR,Controller probably died
09-09-2020T19:34:28,CrRAR,Also I recall certain monitors are picky about resolutions and such over certain cables
09-09-2020T19:35:25,CrRAR,"We had a varient of a monitor at work I was like ""HDMI"" is good for everything... it wouldn't do a certain resolution I was dumbstruck, it would do it on DVI though which was crazy"
09-09-2020T19:36:14,CrRAR,When I finally looked it up there was like a 2312HD & 2312HD't' or something like that and the 't' model had a shitty HDMI scaler or something
09-09-2020T19:36:34,CrRAR,basically it was the cheaper somewhat defective model
09-09-2020T19:36:58,CrRAR,"that they probably still wanted to sell, like thos 3 core AMDs forever ago xD"
09-09-2020T19:37:18,CrRAR,one core defective: DISABLE IT!
09-09-2020T19:37:23,CrRAR,SELL IT!
09-09-2020T19:37:32,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-clovischuckle::moneybag:
09-09-2020T19:38:29,CrRAR,There is some weird key combo it Windows 10 to reset GFX drivers
09-09-2020T19:38:44,CrRAR,it's like alt+ctrl+shif+B
09-09-2020T19:39:20,CrRAR,"ah excuse me, ctrl+win+shif+B"
09-09-2020T19:41:42,Dadrobit,"Well, I know that the DP is still functional, so I just got a meter of that."
09-09-2020T19:42:00,CrRAR,"problem fixed, good to go"
09-09-2020T19:42:06,CrRAR,:cw0lfmare-Paperembercool:
09-09-2020T19:42:16,Dadrobit,"Monitor is kinda sorta oldish, so it's not the end of the world"
09-09-2020T19:42:16,CrRAR,:thumbsup:
09-09-2020T19:42:30,CrRAR,yeah no biggie
09-09-2020T19:43:39,Dadrobit,"3 or 4 years in service. not great, not terrible."
09-09-2020T19:54:38,SpazztasticKiwi,I was gone
09-09-2020T19:54:43,SpazztasticKiwi,for FIVE MINUTES
09-09-2020T19:55:47,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve been sorta dozing for an hour
09-09-2020T19:56:44,SpazztasticKiwi,dadro did you get to see the chihuahua in the clown costume
09-09-2020T20:06:31,SpazztasticKiwi,someone tell me this ain‚Äôt a fridge door I‚Äôm looking at in this houses kitchen https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/524825976597643265/753783335700135956/image0.jpg
09-09-2020T20:06:50,SpazztasticKiwi,what are you hanging in there? whole meat cuts?
09-09-2020T20:10:00,Dadrobit,"The IT dog? Yeah, I think so."
09-09-2020T20:10:28,Dadrobit,"Also, fridges like that are pretty common in the houses where I work."
09-09-2020T20:10:59,Dadrobit,"These folks have their own personal professional chefs that cook anything at any time, so they need everything they could ever need at all times."
09-09-2020T20:11:52,CrRAR,oh yeah full size commercial
09-09-2020T20:12:17,CrRAR,The town I worked in's Fire Dept built a brand new station and had that setup
09-09-2020T20:12:19,SpazztasticKiwi,that ain‚Äôt a fridge it‚Äôs a restaurant cooler
09-09-2020T20:12:37,SpazztasticKiwi,hang a whole slaughtered cow in there
09-09-2020T20:12:48,CrRAR,I think they are like two completely separate units that are just bracketed together with trim
09-09-2020T20:12:51,SpazztasticKiwi,love the house look tho
09-09-2020T20:12:58,SpazztasticKiwi,don‚Äôt need 4 bedrooms
09-09-2020T20:13:01,CrRAR,like freezer/fridge
09-09-2020T20:13:22,CrRAR,Works for people I guess who love to keep months of meats frozen on-hand
09-09-2020T20:13:27,Dadrobit,Even the servants for these folks are loaded. Was talking to one of them about their day job and he started talking about his own chef traveling with him to his day job.
09-09-2020T20:13:45,Dadrobit,"Like, it's a completely different echelon of people here."
09-09-2020T20:13:53,CrRAR,yeahhh
09-09-2020T20:14:33,Dadrobit,"Oh, how much do you make doing that? ""Hm, oh it's only $45 an hour"""
09-09-2020T20:14:41,SpazztasticKiwi,more money than sense or more money than there are reasonable things to spend it on
09-09-2020T20:15:18,Dadrobit,The second for most of em. They're good folks for the most part just doing their own thing.
09-09-2020T20:15:38,SpazztasticKiwi,I need to start doing my jogging in another neighborhood
09-09-2020T20:15:38,CrRAR,It really is just like royalty social circles back in the medieval times
09-09-2020T20:16:00,SpazztasticKiwi,have you seen the video of the girl driving by the docks with a loudspeaker on her car
09-09-2020T20:17:08,SpazztasticKiwi,‚Äúattention. attention. I am looking for a sugar daddy with a boat. I repeat: I am looking for a sugar daddy with a boat. my beginning requested allowance is $200/week-‚Äú (cuts off)
09-09-2020T20:33:06,CrRAR,Those announcements are probably like the ice cream truck jingle to them at this point
09-09-2020T20:36:26,CrRAR,"also, $200 a week is pretty modest"
09-09-2020T20:36:43,CrRAR,...for rich dude caliber
09-09-2020T21:00:19,SpazztasticKiwi,am I wasting my breath on a guy that thinks getting a girlfriend is gonna solve his problems
