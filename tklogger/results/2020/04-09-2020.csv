04-09-2020T00:00:09,Dadrobit,Hentai you say? Guess I'm getting the hardback versions.
04-09-2020T00:00:17,Dadrobit,o/ kirov
04-09-2020T00:00:18,Ordithus,night kirov
04-09-2020T00:01:37,SageSaga,it's probably digital only
04-09-2020T00:02:33,Dadrobit,"Yeah, it was a joke. I might legitimately check it out though."
04-09-2020T00:04:30,Dadrobit,By Dutch?
04-09-2020T00:04:40,Dadrobit,Futch*
04-09-2020T00:04:56,SpazztasticKiwi,high school of the dead is not kindle unlimited
04-09-2020T00:05:00,SpazztasticKiwi,I checked
04-09-2020T00:05:08,SageSaga,Scottie Futch yes
04-09-2020T00:05:37,Dadrobit,I just wanna know how you found this in the first place.
04-09-2020T00:06:24,SageSaga,it was recommended after i read one of the authors Friends work
04-09-2020T00:06:25,SpazztasticKiwi,but the power fantasy one is unlimited
04-09-2020T00:06:50,SageSaga,daniel shinhofen
04-09-2020T00:07:00,SageSaga,who by the way is an awesome guy
04-09-2020T00:07:22,SageSaga,i recommend his Aether's Revival series- book 2 just went up recently
04-09-2020T00:10:12,SageSaga,hes also awesome because he was the guy who sent me all the money i needed to get AI printed
04-09-2020T00:10:58,Dadrobit,I am legitimately astounded. Over 100 reviews and nearly a perfect 5 star rating.
04-09-2020T00:11:17,Dadrobit,Ohhhh~ so you legit know these folks
04-09-2020T00:11:30,SageSaga,just Daniel- i dont know the other guy
04-09-2020T00:11:47,SageSaga,and even then I only know Daniel because he contacted me back when i was trying to kickstart
04-09-2020T00:12:34,SageSaga,hes one of those awesome people that believes strongly in supporting other creatives because if interest is drummed up in similar material people will find their way around to others doing similar things
04-09-2020T00:12:39,SageSaga,like him and his friends
04-09-2020T00:12:58,SageSaga,you know- that crazy idea that by helping others you help yourself
04-09-2020T00:15:22,SageSaga,but yeah- when my kickstarter failed- he sent me 4K to get it printed anyways
04-09-2020T00:15:53,Dadrobit,"Well, he just got some of it back at least, got the first book in the Aether series just now."
04-09-2020T00:16:27,PurpleLemons,pretty much done if not close
04-09-2020T00:16:38,Ordithus,great work purp
04-09-2020T00:16:41,SageSaga,im gonna be trying to put AI up on Amazon soon
04-09-2020T00:16:48,SageSaga,yeah awesome work Purple!
04-09-2020T00:16:58,Ordithus,:zap:
04-09-2020T00:17:08,Dadrobit,"Alas, Power Fantasy was only available through Kindle, so had to get the e-version."
04-09-2020T00:19:39,Dadrobit,"Which is too bad, I enjoy having weird parody books mixed in with the real stuff for flavor."
04-09-2020T00:20:07,SageSaga,he needs more readers for sure- hes probably not making enough to do printed
04-09-2020T00:21:17,Dadrobit,"Actually just got a new parody book in last week or so. ""The Dragon With The Girl Tattoo""."
04-09-2020T00:21:29,SageSaga,"what drew my attention to Power Fantasy was the cover to book 2 - i was like- ""Is that just a bad CG version of Darkness from Konosuba? IT IS!"""
04-09-2020T00:21:34,Dadrobit,"Haven't sat down to read it yet, but I have high hopes."
04-09-2020T00:21:36,Ordithus,"must be late, I had to read that a few times"
04-09-2020T00:22:41,Dadrobit,"It's real, very real."
04-09-2020T00:23:28,Dadrobit,Hardcover n everything
04-09-2020T00:24:16,PurpleLemons,next time

04-09-2020T00:24:49,Cynra,thx for streaming!
04-09-2020T00:24:57,SageSaga,night Purple! thanks for joining me!
04-09-2020T00:25:31,Dadrobit,"Oh, almost forgot a resident brought some snacks for the guards!"
04-09-2020T00:26:19,Dadrobit,"Came into my guard house and the guy on shift tells me, ""hey, they brought us some really nice stuff! I think that candy on top is imported from Europe!"""
04-09-2020T00:26:45,Dadrobit,I pop into our kitchen and it's legit just pocky lol
04-09-2020T00:28:27,ZRO4825,lmao
04-09-2020T00:29:04,AspiringNoodle,You f***ing lucky bastard
04-09-2020T00:29:08,SpazztasticKiwi,“europe”
04-09-2020T00:29:33,SageSaga,they do sell Pocky in Europe -
04-09-2020T00:29:36,AlphaWolf85,Missed the stream because I passed out and fell down the stairs. What was all drawn?
04-09-2020T00:29:59,SageSaga,for whos stream?
04-09-2020T00:30:12,AlphaWolf85,Twokinds
04-09-2020T00:30:30,SageSaga,he worked on the comic and ended early because he got sick
04-09-2020T00:30:48,AlphaWolf85,Ok
04-09-2020T00:31:03,BadFoMo,He also colored ther Zen X Raine pic.
04-09-2020T00:31:09,BadFoMo,*the
04-09-2020T00:31:13,Dadrobit,Pretty sure they just got it from Costco lol. Everything else is Kirkland's.
04-09-2020T00:31:26,MarvTheHugPharaoh,That pic is already my pc background >.>
04-09-2020T00:31:34,Dadrobit,"Oh, sorry to hear he's not doing well."
04-09-2020T00:31:55,SageSaga,hopefully he just ate something that didnt sit well
04-09-2020T00:32:07,SageSaga,he does that a lot actually
04-09-2020T00:32:24,SageSaga,hes gotta stop eating canned stuff that he cooks- forgets about and finds later
04-09-2020T00:32:40,AlphaWolf85,I hope he doesn't have to go to the hospital like me
04-09-2020T00:33:13,ZRO4825,That....sounds like a terrible habit.
04-09-2020T00:33:22,Dadrobit,Ohhhh no. I am super cautious about food left out. Everything goes in the fridge before I even dig into the first serving.
04-09-2020T00:33:30,AlphaWolf85,Have a nice day Bye
04-09-2020T00:33:52,Dadrobit,Enjoy the fentanyl 85
04-09-2020T00:35:39,SageSaga,oh D&D last night went pretty well
04-09-2020T00:35:57,SageSaga,i managed to trivialize part of the final boss fight
04-09-2020T00:36:01,Werewing,Get any sweet kills?
04-09-2020T00:36:21,SageSaga,kinda-
04-09-2020T00:36:43,SageSaga,i was responsible for sinking the Soulmonger into the lava while also protecting the entire party
04-09-2020T00:37:43,Dadrobit,Was it entirely killed by the damage from the lava?
04-09-2020T00:38:05,SageSaga,the soulmonger was an artifact- so yes
04-09-2020T00:38:32,SageSaga,our mission was to track it down and either turn it off or destroy it
04-09-2020T00:38:40,Ordithus,lava is pretty effective
04-09-2020T00:38:51,Dadrobit,"Ahhh, gotcha"
04-09-2020T00:39:29,SageSaga,it traps all souls in the world and uses them to convert into power used for arcane rituals - it even starts to drain  the souls from living people that had been resurrected at some point
04-09-2020T00:39:53,AspiringNoodle,My vote would be tactical nuke on Soulmonger's location
04-09-2020T00:40:01,AspiringNoodle,What's the D&D equivalent of a tactical nuke? xD
04-09-2020T00:40:19,SageSaga,basically a wizard who had been resurrected was suddenly starting to die- she found out a bunch of other people were also suddenly losing hold of their souls - discovered the source was in Chult
04-09-2020T00:40:39,SageSaga,they did some research and hired adventurers to go out into the Jungles of Chult and find it to stop it
04-09-2020T00:40:56,Werewing,"Ah, I think I read a bit of the module via the Idle game Wizards made."
04-09-2020T00:40:58,Dadrobit,Was unfamiliar with it. Soulmonger sounds like a battlemage necromancer-esque character that steals souls
04-09-2020T00:41:18,SageSaga,a powerful lich was using it to create some kind of creature that was feeding off of its power
04-09-2020T00:41:37,Ordithus,darn liches
04-09-2020T00:41:44,Ordithus,always causing trouble
04-09-2020T00:41:46,SageSaga,"soon as we found it suspended over lava i was like ""This thing needs to go in the Lava"""
04-09-2020T00:42:53,SageSaga,it was way too big to just break- so our druid and cleric put down AOE sustainable spells on the monster and on one of the Struts holding it up
04-09-2020T00:43:39,SageSaga,"and i used Steel Wind Strike to attack it all- then i got slapped by a tentacle and i was like ""never again"" and threw up a wall of force"
04-09-2020T00:44:03,SageSaga,positioned it to block the tentacles but still gave room to attack the strut
04-09-2020T00:44:12,Werewing,Never drag Sage into your Hentai!
04-09-2020T00:44:18,SageSaga,it also blocked the monster so they just had to sit there and diiiieeee
04-09-2020T00:45:09,SageSaga,a few rounds later we destroy the strut and the other two came loose and it fell into the lava- and shattered from the heat
04-09-2020T00:45:44,SageSaga,then the lich came out to mess us up- immediately stopped time and destroyed a bunch of stuff and buffed himself
04-09-2020T00:46:13,SageSaga,time started again and my wall of force was gone and he was floating over the lava
04-09-2020T00:46:26,Werewing,Destroyed stuff? Wasn't it in its own lair?
04-09-2020T00:46:38,SageSaga,he destroyed the exit
04-09-2020T00:46:44,SageSaga,and technically its not his lair
04-09-2020T00:46:52,SageSaga,hes using it but its not his XD
04-09-2020T00:46:57,Ordithus,what is with this guy and lava
04-09-2020T00:47:11,Ordithus,"keeping valuables over it, floating over it"
04-09-2020T00:47:32,SageSaga,yeah Ord- its why I cast dispell magic on him
04-09-2020T00:47:36,Ordithus,haha
04-09-2020T00:48:22,SageSaga,"he should have fallen into the lava- or tried to counter my spell- but the DM instead just said ""He appears to have no spells responsible for his ability to fly"""
04-09-2020T00:49:03,Werewing,"Darn it, he must've been using wires."
04-09-2020T00:49:21,SageSaga,"which he admitted after it was over that was bullcrap- it was the fly spell but a bunch of resources say ""Best to just not let them do this if they figure it out because it ruins the fight"""
04-09-2020T00:50:13,Werewing,That could have been handled more elegantly.
04-09-2020T00:51:00,SageSaga,not really- theres no magical item that lets you fly that wouldnt be affected as well
04-09-2020T00:51:35,Werewing,"Counterspell or Magical Nullification Fields, or Featherfall."
04-09-2020T00:51:46,SageSaga,he also didnt have to explain it because i didnt have detect magic up
04-09-2020T00:51:55,Werewing,Alright.
04-09-2020T00:53:15,SageSaga,i was a little disappointed i didnt get my Phoenix Down Achievement
04-09-2020T00:53:59,Werewing,I do not understand that reference.
04-09-2020T00:54:18,SageSaga,killing an enemy with an item or spell that isnt meant to kill
04-09-2020T00:54:35,SageSaga,using a Phoenix down in FF on an undead boss is where it comes from
04-09-2020T00:55:15,Werewing,Oh.
04-09-2020T00:56:33,SageSaga,oh yeah- since that Power Fantasy Book is going to FF7 i bet hes gonna buy a bunch of Phoenix downs
04-09-2020T00:57:09,Dadrobit,Lol
04-09-2020T00:58:11,Ordithus,could have had the fly spell be a 9th level cast... maybe with a really weird charm
04-09-2020T00:58:34,SageSaga,i can easily dispel lvl 9 magic
04-09-2020T00:58:37,Ordithus,the power of the gods! to float about
04-09-2020T00:58:38,Ordithus,ah
04-09-2020T00:59:08,SageSaga,im an abjuration wizard- its kinda my thing
04-09-2020T00:59:35,SageSaga,even the smartest of wizards only get a max of a +5 to their caster check
04-09-2020T00:59:40,SageSaga,I had a +9
04-09-2020T00:59:58,SageSaga,so i just had to roll 10 or higher
04-09-2020T01:00:22,SageSaga,and i did
04-09-2020T01:03:07,SageSaga,hmm- he wont be able to buy Ethers i bet- even those are something he needs really badly
04-09-2020T01:03:36,SageSaga,were there any MP restoring items you could buy in FF7?
04-09-2020T01:03:44,Ordithus,ethers
04-09-2020T01:03:53,SageSaga,. . .
04-09-2020T01:04:02,Ordithus,elixirs are the ones that you can't buy
04-09-2020T01:04:07,ZRO4825,"No ethers, either."
04-09-2020T01:04:11,Ordithus,really?
04-09-2020T01:04:40,Ordithus,"huh, memory fails me.  it has been quite a few years..."
04-09-2020T01:05:13,SageSaga,Ether joke - https://twitter.com/ProZD/status/812067795030671360
04-09-2020T01:07:09,SageSaga,i dont think a Tent would work-
04-09-2020T01:07:58,Ordithus,"tents are like an inn, full rest"
04-09-2020T01:08:02,Dadrobit,Back. Work is working.
04-09-2020T01:08:29,Dadrobit,"Is he going to OG FF7, or Remake?"
04-09-2020T01:08:51,SageSaga,probably OG but since i guess hes writing it now it could be Remake
04-09-2020T01:09:14,Dadrobit,"(not a fan of the female, just a personal opinion)"
04-09-2020T01:09:25,Dadrobit,Remake*
04-09-2020T01:09:37,Dadrobit,Females are excellent
04-09-2020T01:09:40,Ordithus,"oddly my ancient ff7 guide was handy, ethers can be bought! :P"
04-09-2020T01:10:50,SageSaga,not in midgar though right?
04-09-2020T01:12:15,SageSaga,oh! he has the steal ability- he can probably steal them and turbo ethers
04-09-2020T01:12:16,Ordithus,no not in midgar... it would be the most expensive thing in midgar if you could
04-09-2020T01:15:10,Dadrobit,"If he wants to really make it interesting, he could enter the Remake world in hard mode and find that he can't use ANY items."
04-09-2020T01:17:59,SageSaga,funny thing is- hes going there for a cure to Zombie
04-09-2020T01:18:17,SageSaga,but FF7 didnt have Zombify as a status
04-09-2020T01:18:39,SageSaga,he did know that though because he requested a version of the FF7 parody world that did have it
04-09-2020T01:19:21,Dadrobit,That seems like an abusable amount of power.
04-09-2020T01:19:52,Dadrobit,"But... I mean... I guess ""Power Fantasy"""
04-09-2020T01:20:02,Dadrobit,S'kinda right in the title.
04-09-2020T01:20:11,SageSaga,yep XD but the trade off is hes not in control of everything
04-09-2020T01:20:44,SageSaga,the flying Spaghetti monster is basically the DM and is looking for entertainment - so hes gonna throw curve balls
04-09-2020T01:21:14,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I was gonna ask if the FSM is just a ""be careful what you wish for"" genie substitute."
04-09-2020T01:21:43,SpazztasticKiwi,I feel like I’ve stumbled into a language I know but the words are jumbled
04-09-2020T01:24:56,SageSaga,and im done!
04-09-2020T01:25:02,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Very well done
04-09-2020T01:25:02,BadFoMo,Cool.
04-09-2020T01:25:03,Dadrobit,Right on man
04-09-2020T01:25:08,Ordithus,sweet!
04-09-2020T01:25:17,JeremySenpai,:cjeremysenpai-thumbsup:
04-09-2020T01:25:31,SpazztasticKiwi,huzzah
04-09-2020T01:25:32,SageSaga,i'll be back to color it in uhhh- 12 hours and 35 minutes
04-09-2020T01:25:38,Ordithus,"""ha, you're dead now, right? Right? Oh no"""
04-09-2020T01:25:50,SageSaga,oh
04-09-2020T01:25:52,SageSaga,sneak peak
04-09-2020T01:25:59,SageSaga,only gonna show it for a second
04-09-2020T01:26:07,SageSaga,not literally a second but not long
04-09-2020T01:27:03,Ordithus,boom
04-09-2020T01:27:11,BadFoMo,Dang!
04-09-2020T01:27:27,SageSaga,next update is gonna have 2 pages
04-09-2020T01:27:32,ZRO4825,:o

04-09-2020T01:27:37,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:eyes:
04-09-2020T01:27:41,ZRO4825,"Welp, I missed it, silly me being alt-tabbed, lol"
04-09-2020T01:27:43,Ordithus,:ptv-excited:
04-09-2020T01:27:53,Ordithus,you'll see it later~
04-09-2020T01:27:56,SageSaga,one of the pages is mostly a splash page
04-09-2020T01:28:03,ZRO4825,"That I will most likely, Ord~"
04-09-2020T01:28:05,SageSaga,so i did it earlier
04-09-2020T01:28:12,Ordithus,or watch the vod

04-09-2020T01:28:25,BadFoMo,Bye.
04-09-2020T01:28:25,ZRO4825,"That, Ord, would require time and effort. :V"

04-09-2020T01:28:33,ZRO4825,"Have a g'night, Sage. ^_^"

04-09-2020T01:41:24,Dadrobit,"Ohh, that reminds me, I need to get my suggestion in."
04-09-2020T01:43:27,Dadrobit,Aaaaand it's in!
04-09-2020T01:43:56,Dadrobit,"Got second place last voting week, so I am CONFIDENT"
04-09-2020T01:44:09,Dadrobit,That it'll at least get three votes this time.
04-09-2020T01:44:39,SpazztasticKiwi,confidence leads to arrogance dear grasshopper
04-09-2020T01:45:36,SpazztasticKiwi,speaking of grasshoppers one flew in my car when I backed out of the driveway
04-09-2020T01:45:55,SpazztasticKiwi,then started trying to eat the floorboard fabric
04-09-2020T01:46:35,Dadrobit,Did you help your new friend find real food?
04-09-2020T01:46:52,AspiringNoodle,"Oof, what did you eat Tom???"
04-09-2020T01:47:04,SpazztasticKiwi,flicked him back out the window like a used cigarette
04-09-2020T01:47:13,AspiringNoodle,lol
04-09-2020T01:47:28,SpazztasticKiwi,“no free rides”
04-09-2020T01:47:29,Dadrobit,gasps

04-09-2020T01:47:47,Dadrobit,Littering is a crime!
04-09-2020T01:48:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I say no free rides but I was in town before I bothered with him
04-09-2020T01:48:23,SpazztasticKiwi,“I’ll get to the store .... then you shall be yeeted”
04-09-2020T01:48:43,Dadrobit,"I s'pose since it was a big, what you committed was ""crittering"""

04-09-2020T01:51:57,Dadrobit,Fun! So how's the fresh linens feel now?
04-09-2020T01:52:28,SpazztasticKiwi,I was unimpressed
04-09-2020T01:52:45,SpazztasticKiwi,likely the one that stung me a day ago & lost
04-09-2020T01:54:09,Dadrobit,"Never been stung by a scorpion to my knowledge. Dealt with em all my life, but sfaik I've always seen them first."
04-09-2020T01:54:56,SpazztasticKiwi,spotted the fker crawling across my top sheet right in front of my phone next to my arm when I catapulted him to Jerusalem  to pray before meeting the all maker
04-09-2020T01:55:05,Dadrobit,"Have had some crazy bug bites/stings that came from unknown sources though, so I dunno."
04-09-2020T01:55:37,SpazztasticKiwi,found him missing a claw in the blanket when I stabbed him with my scissors & set him on fire
04-09-2020T01:56:49,SpazztasticKiwi,the only time I’ll kill a bug besides it being a wasp is if it’s in my space
04-09-2020T01:57:16,SpazztasticKiwi,this shit had stung me 4+ times
04-09-2020T01:58:05,SpazztasticKiwi,death warrant signed
04-09-2020T01:59:10,SpazztasticKiwi,scorpion stings grow into a welt with a red dot in the middle - wasps do the same for me but scorpions don’t swell like a wasp sting does
04-09-2020T01:59:44,AspiringNoodle,scorpions have not learned to fear the weird furless things walking on two legs
04-09-2020T01:59:47,AspiringNoodle,Kill them 'til they do
04-09-2020T01:59:49,AspiringNoodle,@w@
04-09-2020T01:59:51,SpazztasticKiwi,the whole area swells if it’s a wasp - scorpions itch & look like the eye of Sauron
04-09-2020T02:01:36,AspiringNoodle,Dunno why... but I bought pork rinds from Sheetz...
04-09-2020T02:01:54,AspiringNoodle,"Not sure if I'll like them, didn't care for the BBQ ones I bought from work... but this one has fancy packaging :ptv-excited:"
04-09-2020T02:07:50,SpazztasticKiwi,5/6 stings
04-09-2020T02:07:57,SpazztasticKiwi,I wish I could kill him again
04-09-2020T02:12:44,SpazztasticKiwi,worst bedmate
04-09-2020T02:13:00,SpazztasticKiwi,night was not enjoyed
04-09-2020T02:17:52,SpazztasticKiwi,but I spooked Bagheera when I went on my murder manhunt
04-09-2020T02:28:41,AspiringNoodle,"""Momma has this weird look in her eye... it scares me."""
04-09-2020T02:43:06,AspiringNoodle,Tried the new pork rinds
04-09-2020T02:43:14,AspiringNoodle,They're okay-ish.  Better than the other ones I bought
04-09-2020T02:43:26,AspiringNoodle,"Just don't hink I'm a pork rind person, lol"
