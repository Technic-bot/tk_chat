30-03-2020T00:09:48,AspiringNoodle,I feel old
30-03-2020T00:09:53,AspiringNoodle,Only 26 and I see multiple gray hairs xD
30-03-2020T00:11:05,SonOfGoku,"Could be worse, I have a friend from high school that had a few grey hairs when we were in middle school"
30-03-2020T00:12:00,AspiringNoodle,Me: *35 and fully gray*
30-03-2020T00:12:11,AspiringNoodle,"Other people: ""You look so young! How?"""
30-03-2020T00:12:33,AspiringNoodle,...just realized that's the perfect chance to troll people
30-03-2020T00:12:40,AspiringNoodle,"""I found a great anti-aging treatment! :D"""
30-03-2020T00:12:57,SonOfGoku,He's just turned 21 a few weeks ago and is half way there
30-03-2020T00:13:02,AspiringNoodle,Them: :ptv-ohmy:
30-03-2020T00:13:09,SonOfGoku,That would be funny
30-03-2020T00:13:14,AspiringNoodle,"Me: ""I'm not even 40."""
30-03-2020T00:13:19,AspiringNoodle,Them: :ptv-unimpressed:
30-03-2020T00:13:27,AspiringNoodle,Me: :ptv-snicker:
30-03-2020T00:14:01,AspiringNoodle,"That said, I'm not completely turned off by gray hair"
30-03-2020T00:14:10,AspiringNoodle,"It just sucks that you can only get it with age, ahahaha"
30-03-2020T00:14:32,SonOfGoku,Unless your Raine
30-03-2020T00:14:40,AspiringNoodle,Lucky girl :ptv-unimpressed:
30-03-2020T00:14:49,AspiringNoodle,*still gives all the brushies*
30-03-2020T00:15:04,AspiringNoodle,*makes raine clone out of shed fur*
30-03-2020T00:15:07,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-snicker:
30-03-2020T00:16:10,SonOfGoku,Saria beat you to that idea
30-03-2020T00:16:29,SonOfGoku,https://www.patreon.com/posts/shed-fur-cloning-28403525
30-03-2020T00:16:51,AspiringNoodle,That's the idea :ptv-hearts:
30-03-2020T00:17:01,AspiringNoodle,See if she's as amused as Rose was
30-03-2020T00:17:32,AspiringNoodle,"Also, can you imagine how *good* that would probably feel?"
30-03-2020T00:17:57,SonOfGoku,"Question is would ""Red"" be tricked?"
30-03-2020T00:17:59,AspiringNoodle,"Probably like an overdue haircut, but x10 more refreshing"
30-03-2020T00:18:06,AspiringNoodle,...we must find out
30-03-2020T00:18:16,AspiringNoodle,Too bad more people aren't online to scoop up that suggestion xD
30-03-2020T00:18:53,AspiringNoodle,Fur Clone 2: Raine Edition.  Will Red be fooled?  Stick around to find out!
30-03-2020T00:19:48,AspiringNoodle,"Btw, almost beat A Story About My Uncle.  Good game!  Might try some of the time trials.  One last level and I've found 20 / 25 collectibles :)"
30-03-2020T00:32:36,SonOfGoku,Right now I'm playing Call of Duty but I'm waiting for Resident Evil 2 to go on sale to buy it
30-03-2020T00:39:39,BlackjackSec99,waves at the lurking Tom
30-03-2020T00:40:25,SonOfGoku,Hi Blackjack
30-03-2020T00:40:30,BlackjackSec99,hallo
30-03-2020T00:40:59,BlackjackSec99,"dont mind me, just dropping in for a few before bed. I go back to work tomorrow :("
30-03-2020T00:41:30,SonOfGoku,Good luck out there tomorrow
30-03-2020T00:41:52,AspiringNoodle,My job irks me
30-03-2020T00:41:57,AspiringNoodle,Ton of things that need done
30-03-2020T00:42:14,AspiringNoodle,+ stupid checks that need done every 1 / 2 / 4 hours
30-03-2020T00:42:36,AspiringNoodle,I swear it's like they expect ADHD people to run this place
30-03-2020T00:44:31,AspiringNoodle,I'll probably make it a point to quit before I'm there for a year
30-03-2020T00:44:54,AspiringNoodle,"Soooo... new job in 5 months, lol"
30-03-2020T00:45:56,JojoF2415,One of the best Geometry dash reactions in my opinion
30-03-2020T00:46:00,JojoF2415,https://youtu.be/Bs1kVySdUtI
30-03-2020T00:47:33,SonOfGoku,How's your present for your mom going Jojo?
30-03-2020T00:48:17,AspiringNoodle,"LOL, that first guy flipped the freak out"
30-03-2020T00:49:06,JojoF2415,Less than half way done
30-03-2020T00:49:10,AspiringNoodle,"Also, Geometry dash is officially ""ADHD the game"""
30-03-2020T00:49:22,JojoF2415,That was kind of me on new years
30-03-2020T00:56:00,AspiringNoodle,1 second less? :P
30-03-2020T00:56:17,AspiringNoodle,stupid taskbar
30-03-2020T00:59:03,JojoF2415,I need more wave practice for Nine Circles
30-03-2020T01:02:02,SonOfGoku,How many attempts have you had so far?
30-03-2020T01:05:04,JojoF2415,3583 attempts
30-03-2020T01:05:43,SonOfGoku,"That's a lot, how far have you gotten?"
30-03-2020T01:06:07,JojoF2415,Still a 41%
30-03-2020T01:06:24,JojoF2415,I reduced the amount of attempts in practice mode
30-03-2020T01:06:45,JojoF2415,God eater easy was my worst nightmare
30-03-2020T01:07:55,JojoF2415,About 12000 attempts. More than half a year of practice. 1 97% fail
30-03-2020T01:08:34,JojoF2415,My last achievement of 2019
30-03-2020T01:09:04,SonOfGoku,That must have been frustrating
30-03-2020T01:09:07,JojoF2415,Literally 9 minutes before 2020
30-03-2020T01:09:30,JojoF2415,It was. I almost cried when I got that 97%
30-03-2020T01:10:07,JojoF2415,Also there was a bug on 54% on the level which instantly killed me
30-03-2020T01:10:53,SonOfGoku,Has it been fixed?
30-03-2020T01:10:59,JojoF2415,No
30-03-2020T01:11:28,JojoF2415,It was a huge relief beating that level
30-03-2020T01:12:11,JojoF2415,Lately I’ve been playing Minecraft
30-03-2020T01:12:25,JojoF2415,I found a skeleton spawner
30-03-2020T01:12:30,AspiringNoodle,A Story About My Uncle <3
30-03-2020T01:12:48,JojoF2415,I really need to read bloodline
30-03-2020T01:12:54,AspiringNoodle,"Played WoW earlier, slipped back into the grind a little when I did, quickly got tired of it.  Didn't even play for half an hour..."
30-03-2020T01:13:07,AspiringNoodle,"If that doesn't scream burnout, I don't know what does."
30-03-2020T01:13:41,JojoF2415,Also improve my art skill because I’m not satisfied with it
30-03-2020T01:13:51,AspiringNoodle,"Have fun feeling that way for your entire life, haha"
30-03-2020T01:14:13,AspiringNoodle,"Artist - Age 20: Eugh, this looks like crap!"
30-03-2020T01:14:23,AspiringNoodle,"Artist - Age 90: Eugh, this looks like crap!"
30-03-2020T01:14:34,SonOfGoku,At least your making more progress than I am
30-03-2020T01:14:49,AspiringNoodle,And definitely more than me :ptv-snicker:
30-03-2020T01:15:10,JojoF2415,Is my art skill good for a 15 year old
30-03-2020T01:15:31,SonOfGoku,The last time I drew something was probably a year ago for a drafting class I took
30-03-2020T01:15:32,BlackjackSec99,*sigh* its always disappointing when you find out a public figure you liked drank way too much of the Koolaid...  *clicks unfollow on IG of their profile*
30-03-2020T01:16:25,BlackjackSec99,"jojo, yes, yes it is."
30-03-2020T01:16:38,SonOfGoku,Yes it is
30-03-2020T01:16:47,AspiringNoodle,It's definitely above where I'm at.  So keep at it!
30-03-2020T01:16:58,JojoF2415,Ok thanks
30-03-2020T01:17:16,AspiringNoodle,"Also, keep this in mind, as it's something I'm struggling with"
30-03-2020T01:17:29,AspiringNoodle,"It's not a matter of when you start, or how long you do something"
30-03-2020T01:17:52,AspiringNoodle,It's a matter of how much you get out of the effort you put in
30-03-2020T01:17:59,BlackjackSec99,"lol I can barely draw stick figures. I got a wacom, but its a learning process, esp when I dont have steady hands that always listen to what I tell them"
30-03-2020T01:18:09,AspiringNoodle,"Someone could do art for 15 years, and barely improve because they don't put the effort in to learn and get better"
30-03-2020T01:18:15,BlackjackSec99,^
30-03-2020T01:18:20,AspiringNoodle,"Meanwhile someone could only be at it for 4 years, and be light years ahead of the other guy"
30-03-2020T01:18:23,JojoF2415,I can’t do digital art
30-03-2020T01:18:48,JojoF2415,That’s how long I’ve been drawing. 4 years
30-03-2020T01:18:57,AspiringNoodle,"My barrier will be that I bought an overpriced tablet for digital art, but didn't bother getting one with a screen"
30-03-2020T01:19:15,AspiringNoodle,"Quick question, how often do you draw?  How many hours in a session?"
30-03-2020T01:19:16,BlackjackSec99,"yeah, youre doing good, no worries."
30-03-2020T01:19:32,AspiringNoodle,"Do you work on finished pieces, or do you do a lot of practice sketches and studies?"
30-03-2020T01:19:43,JojoF2415,Rarely now
30-03-2020T01:20:03,AspiringNoodle,"Ultimately, my questions are meaningless"
30-03-2020T01:20:34,AspiringNoodle,"The real questions are: ""Are you happy with your work?""  If yes, everything's cool.  If no, ""Do you want to get better?"""
30-03-2020T01:21:08,AspiringNoodle,"If yes, ""Practice harder"".  If no, ""Then why do you draw?  Do you enjoy it?"""
30-03-2020T01:21:58,AspiringNoodle,"26 here, still haven't really gotten any momentum into art"
30-03-2020T01:22:03,JojoF2415,sometimes I am happy with my work sometimes I’m not
30-03-2020T01:22:26,JojoF2415,I joined the TK streams when I was 14
30-03-2020T01:22:28,AspiringNoodle,"As much as I would LOVE to blame video games and Warcraft for the past 14 years or so, it's also my own dang fault"
30-03-2020T01:22:55,AspiringNoodle,That said... hmm... might try drawing a reference sketch tomorrow...
30-03-2020T01:23:20,AspiringNoodle,"Also, keep this in mind Jojo, very few people actually have their whole deal together at such a young age"
30-03-2020T01:24:00,AspiringNoodle,Western Society LOVES focusing on the firsts and the very young successful individuals who were doing something basically their whole life.
30-03-2020T01:24:19,AspiringNoodle,"But they are the exception, not the rule"
30-03-2020T01:24:48,JojoF2415,I really don’t want my future job to be art related
30-03-2020T01:24:57,AspiringNoodle,Then that's perfectly fine~
30-03-2020T01:25:31,AspiringNoodle,"You can keep it as a hobby, devote more time to it, if you wish, in order to get better.  If it gets to a point that it can become your primary source of income, that's also cool"
30-03-2020T01:25:45,AspiringNoodle,But don't stress too much
30-03-2020T01:26:48,JojoF2415,Ok
30-03-2020T01:31:06,JojoF2415,Is animal crossing a good game?
30-03-2020T01:31:39,SonOfGoku,I've been told it is by some of my friends
30-03-2020T01:33:04,JojoF2415,I may buy it
30-03-2020T01:33:42,AspiringNoodle,The 1 major criticism of the newest game is that it has a 1-island-per-switch policy
30-03-2020T01:33:55,AspiringNoodle,I need to check and see if there are any updates on that situation
30-03-2020T01:34:38,JojoF2415,I miss the old features of the gen 6 Pokémon games
30-03-2020T01:37:32,JojoF2415,Time for me to go to bed
