30-09-2020T01:08:18,SpazztasticKiwi,they have to keep in mind a stranger renting their property for multitudes of other strangers for an event so yeah - it’s called insurance

30-09-2020T01:20:55,AspiringNoodle,I should add the disclaimer that this only applies to a more traditional wedding.
30-09-2020T01:21:22,AspiringNoodle,Plenty of ways to have a wedding that won't break the bank.  Which is where I should admit fault in assuming they were having a traditional wedding.

30-09-2020T20:03:02,Ordithus,despite glasses
30-09-2020T20:04:19,CrRAR,we're you talking about Bluetooth car adapters or the earbuds? I've had the Kinivo BTC450 in the past it works great in cars.
30-09-2020T20:04:20,Dadrobit,"What are they? For me, they have to not leak any sound, so either in ear, or over ear closed backs."
30-09-2020T20:04:42,CrRAR,"the designers at our work though have a square looking one I'm not sure what it is though, that works good too"
30-09-2020T20:05:16,Dadrobit,"The Bluetooth for me is (probably) not even gonna get used again, everything I have is 3/5 compatible."
30-09-2020T20:05:21,Dadrobit,3.5*
30-09-2020T20:05:32,CrRAR,ah
30-09-2020T20:05:56,Dadrobit,But they came in the box and Spazz was asking about Bluetooth buds because she has an IPhone.
30-09-2020T20:06:35,CrRAR,ah x2
30-09-2020T20:06:56,Dadrobit,https://www.shure.com/en-US/products/accessories/rmce-bt2
30-09-2020T20:07:44,Dadrobit,Also has a standard 3.5 cable and a 1/4 inch adapter. So I just swap em.
30-09-2020T20:07:45,Ordithus,I don't have that kind of need.  Bose QC35 and Sennheiser hd 4.40
30-09-2020T20:08:09,CrRAR,oh it turns wired into wireless buds I see
30-09-2020T20:08:15,CrRAR,neat
30-09-2020T20:08:47,CrRAR,damn apple making everything so complictaed
30-09-2020T20:09:34,Dadrobit,MMCX cables are great. Turn anything into anything else.
30-09-2020T20:10:52,CrRAR,:ccrrar-chickcr:
30-09-2020T20:11:51,Dadrobit,"Yeah, Ord. It wasn't purely cuz I wanted them. Though I totally did. Also like to keep work in mind, so a totally flat response was something I was looking for in these."
30-09-2020T20:12:20,Dadrobit,"Hence, they are not great for music and general media consumption."
30-09-2020T20:12:30,Dadrobit,"Like, for fun."
30-09-2020T20:12:43,Dadrobit,Audiobooks probably
30-09-2020T20:13:07,Dadrobit,The 215s are bangers though for music.
30-09-2020T20:13:17,Ordithus,consumer stuff is a-ok for what I need!
30-09-2020T20:13:49,Dadrobit,Moar BASS!
30-09-2020T20:13:50,Ordithus,but these buds are tempting
30-09-2020T20:15:33,Dadrobit,"No joke, the 215s replaced everything else I use. OCCASIONALLY I'll pop in something else for reference, but otherwise..."
30-09-2020T20:15:41,CrRAR,"Yeah, I've noticed Sennheiser is more an ""accurate""/true listening experience, they don't over compensate for the bass."
30-09-2020T20:16:11,CrRAR,That's the reason beats were popular
30-09-2020T20:17:17,CrRAR,all personal opinion and preference though
30-09-2020T20:22:15,Dadrobit,RAYCONS Baby! Who needs to hear dialogue or singers anyways??? https://www.rtings.com/headphones/1-4/graph#1665/3992
30-09-2020T20:23:13,Ordithus,that's... wow
30-09-2020T20:24:38,Dadrobit,When all you want to hear is the sub bass and the snare drum
30-09-2020T20:25:39,Ordithus,huh the qc35 ii seems really good
30-09-2020T20:27:23,Dadrobit,"Honestly, there are a ton of great options nowadays"
30-09-2020T20:28:12,CrRAR,haha
30-09-2020T20:28:18,CrRAR,dat analysis
30-09-2020T20:28:36,Dadrobit,The home artist industry absolutely rocketed forward pro-sumer devices in all things audio for affordable quality.
30-09-2020T20:30:59,Dadrobit,"Anywho, time to get ready for work, be back later!"
30-09-2020T20:31:08,Ordithus,see ya
30-09-2020T20:37:52,AspiringNoodle,Ugh... my sleep schedule is a wreck...
30-09-2020T20:40:29,SpazztasticKiwi,so those headphones are no good for listening to stuff
30-09-2020T20:40:42,SpazztasticKiwi,you know that was the point of me getting new ones right
30-09-2020T20:41:01,SpazztasticKiwi,other than having an excuse to ignore people
30-09-2020T20:52:07,AspiringNoodle,Excuses to ignore people always a good choice :snake: <3
30-09-2020T20:55:37,Dadrobit,"425 no, 215 emphatically yes."

30-09-2020T22:06:25,AspiringNoodle,Honest question time
30-09-2020T22:06:47,AspiringNoodle,"Should I be worried if a retail job starts going, ""This is kinda hurting the business"" when you request less hours?"
30-09-2020T22:07:19,AspiringNoodle,Because not sure if well-intentioned support for the business or manipulation to get more labor...
30-09-2020T22:08:47,CrRAR,Yeah that sounds like they’re trying to appea; to your feelings without actually telling you how much they value you?
30-09-2020T22:08:56,CrRAR,Like a guilt-trip!
30-09-2020T22:10:30,CrRAR,"“You’re the best employee we have, holding the place together, if you could work more again, that’d be GREAAAT”"
30-09-2020T22:11:29,AspiringNoodle,"I like my manager, but it's a bit worrying, because it's 1 day less a week"
30-09-2020T22:11:50,AspiringNoodle,And the store ALWAYS seems to be shortstaffed.
30-09-2020T22:12:08,Dadrobit,"Bruh, don't you already only work like 2 opr 3 days?"
30-09-2020T22:12:10,Dadrobit,or8
30-09-2020T22:12:13,Dadrobit,or*
30-09-2020T22:12:35,AspiringNoodle,That's my point exactly.
30-09-2020T22:12:47,Dadrobit,"Yeah, at that point I can see why they're tired of scheduling around you."
30-09-2020T22:12:54,AspiringNoodle,?
30-09-2020T22:14:43,Dadrobit,Part timers are hella tiring to work with as a manager. People who are only around 2-3 days a week means everyone else has to move their schedules around you.
30-09-2020T22:15:29,Dadrobit,The shifts the part timer doesn't work means someone else has to pick up overtime.
30-09-2020T22:16:11,Dadrobit,"Speaking of, time for me to head out o/"
30-09-2020T22:16:27,AspiringNoodle,have a good one
