02-03-2020T19:06:54,AspiringNoodle,"Question: Every 1 - 2 weeks (I'm gonna say 1.5 or lower on average), I get at least one call asking if I can come in early, cover a missed shift, or swap shifts with someone else.  Is this unreasonable on the part of the employer?"
02-03-2020T19:07:20,AspiringNoodle,It's happening enough that I'm concerned.
02-03-2020T19:09:39,AspiringNoodle,I should also mention that we only get the schedule for the following week at earliest one week in advance.
02-03-2020T21:24:01,Dadrobit,Nope. Welcome to employment my dude. I pull extra hours pretty much every single week to cover for call offs. Literally just got a text asking me to come in early tomorrow as well.
02-03-2020T21:54:17,AspiringNoodle,Do you call off often?  Or have to miss work for any reason?
02-03-2020T22:01:53,JojoF2415,I was successful in making a skeleton farm in Minecraft
