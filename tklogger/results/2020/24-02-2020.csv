24-02-2020T20:24:20,JojoF2415,This is what I get for procrastinating
24-02-2020T20:33:56,SonOfGoku,What happened?
24-02-2020T20:36:59,SpazztasticKiwi,2 cars pulled out in front of me
24-02-2020T21:48:41,AspiringNoodle,"Me to body: ""If you're planning on getting sick anyways, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DO IT THIS WEEK!"""
24-02-2020T22:21:53,SonOfGoku,How are you holding up Noodle?
24-02-2020T22:24:19,AspiringNoodle,My feet hurt and I've got 3 more days before a day off
24-02-2020T23:23:10,CrRAR,Do you have one of those pressure relief pads you can stand on... or maybe get some fancy shoe cushions?

24-02-2020T23:48:22,SpazztasticKiwi,"so I got up today, off for the next 48ish hours now, pretty run of the mill stuff"
24-02-2020T23:48:45,SpazztasticKiwi,surprise - family from out of towns come to visit
24-02-2020T23:49:00,SpazztasticKiwi,everyone else has expected this for a week
24-02-2020T23:49:06,SpazztasticKiwi,nobody told me this
24-02-2020T23:53:21,AspiringNoodle,We do have anti-fatigue mats
24-02-2020T23:53:33,AspiringNoodle,But it's the inherent issue of standing for 8+ hours straight
24-02-2020T23:53:58,AspiringNoodle,For multiple days in a row.  Something the human body really wasn't designed for.
24-02-2020T23:54:35,AspiringNoodle,"We can argue the same about sitting in front of computer monitors 24/7, but at the very least sitting is more comfortable :P"
24-02-2020T23:55:02,SpazztasticKiwi,feels kinda sucky - I have family over and Alonzo Lerone just came online after close to a month of silence to mention that his mom is fading in the hospital
24-02-2020T23:59:46,SpazztasticKiwi,"ah, the update, she‚Äôs passed away"
