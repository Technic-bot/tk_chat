27-12-2020T17:38:57,Ordithus,Good! I have the whole week off from work. You?
27-12-2020T17:39:17,CrimsonQuill,"I'm alright, thanks!"
27-12-2020T17:39:35,CrimsonQuill,I took a few days off for Christmas. Now I have a week to study before my exams.
27-12-2020T17:39:57,CrimsonQuill,"They're all open-book, but they're still going to be hard. I also have a project essay to hand up soon."
27-12-2020T17:40:09,CrimsonQuill,Oh! And I also caught up with the comic.
27-12-2020T17:40:30,CrimsonQuill,Reni is such a sweetheart! (And are those fluffy ears I see atop the Silverlock's head?)
27-12-2020T17:42:19,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-rainehappy: they be
27-12-2020T17:42:41,CrimsonQuill,It's also good to see that Landen and Sealeen are still about.
27-12-2020T17:43:06,CrimsonQuill,I have a theory they may contribute to the story somehow...because what if Sealeen still has those bottles?
27-12-2020T17:43:14,CrimsonQuill,And Landy can punch through a brick wall!
27-12-2020T17:46:36,Ordithus,yeah would be nice if they could make themselves useful after the long hiatus
27-12-2020T17:47:07,Ordithus,"if Sealeen ""breaches and clears"" using a love potion..."
27-12-2020T17:47:08,CrimsonQuill,It's stuff like this that makes me hope that Twokinds is only the first stage in a huge verse.

27-12-2020T17:47:55,CrimsonQuill,"They'd be wondering how the boss was looking so attractive all of a sudden..,and, illusions or no, the secret'd be out!"
27-12-2020T17:54:23,CrimsonQuill,"So, how was the stream last night?"
27-12-2020T18:02:18,Ordithus,I only saw about 5 minutes of it
27-12-2020T18:02:52,CrimsonQuill,Ah okay
27-12-2020T18:03:02,CrimsonQuill,"I missed it, 'cos I was reading chapters 20-21 again"
27-12-2020T18:05:35,CrimsonQuill,Oooohhh...I...may also have done a thing...

27-12-2020T20:49:55,CrRAR,I think I literally played Spyro for all of 3 minutes in my life
27-12-2020T20:49:59,CrRAR,"so, an attempt was made you could say"

27-12-2020T21:46:38,AspiringNoodle,"About to hand in notice, yaaaaaay"
27-12-2020T21:47:02,AspiringNoodle,So far got a blank envelope with the letter inside... I wonder if I should address it to my manager on the outside :thinking:
27-12-2020T21:48:30,CrRAR,Direct manager usually I guess?
27-12-2020T21:50:45,Dadrobit,You do have another job already right?
27-12-2020T21:50:49,AspiringNoodle,Yeah
27-12-2020T21:50:57,Dadrobit,Where at?
27-12-2020T21:51:14,AspiringNoodle,Instacart
27-12-2020T21:51:28,Dadrobit,"Oof, good luck."
27-12-2020T21:51:55,AspiringNoodle,I still have that *other* job that's kinda stuck in limbo
27-12-2020T21:52:10,Dadrobit,"Also, I'd send an email as well. Keep a paper trail on your end as well."
27-12-2020T21:52:28,Dadrobit,"Speaking of work, off I go."
27-12-2020T21:52:30,AspiringNoodle,"But at this point, this place has worn away my last nerve."
27-12-2020T21:52:41,CrRAR,:v: dadro
27-12-2020T21:52:51,AspiringNoodle,I also still have outstanding applications to DoorDash and GrubHub.
27-12-2020T21:52:54,AspiringNoodle,"Well, have fun at work."
27-12-2020T21:54:13,CrRAR,"yeah, I swear there should be some sort of mechanism to getting some downtime after leaving poorly managed jobs"
27-12-2020T21:54:45,AspiringNoodle,At this point I SWEAR it's corporate...
27-12-2020T21:55:46,AspiringNoodle,"That said, I am getting some time off, haha"
27-12-2020T21:55:52,CrRAR,"like, enough people should be able to raise a grievance to a labor bureau or something"
27-12-2020T21:55:57,CrRAR,nice
27-12-2020T21:56:03,CrRAR,:ptv-dealwithit:
27-12-2020T21:56:18,AspiringNoodle,Instacart gives you 45 days after either signing on or being approved to make a delivery before they remove you for inactivity
27-12-2020T21:56:37,AspiringNoodle,"If it's starting the application, I'm good until the end of January."
27-12-2020T21:56:53,CrRAR,Ah cool
27-12-2020T21:57:23,AspiringNoodle,"If it's when I was officially given the green light, then I've got 40 days, lmao"
27-12-2020T21:57:44,CrRAR,Use the non terrible winter weather to your advantage though
27-12-2020T21:57:45,AspiringNoodle,On top of that... I've built up quite a bit of money in my bank account thanks to the freeze on federal student loans
27-12-2020T21:58:03,CrRAR,fantastic
27-12-2020T21:58:07,AspiringNoodle,Which was once again extended until the end of january
27-12-2020T21:58:15,AspiringNoodle,"Seriously, just extend it on a 3-month basis..."
27-12-2020T21:58:31,AspiringNoodle,"Don't do this thing where we near the end of the current freeze and it's like, ""We pushed it back a month."""
27-12-2020T21:59:20,CrRAR,Eh that tells you how disorganized everything is
27-12-2020T22:01:12,AspiringNoodle,Well
27-12-2020T22:01:21,AspiringNoodle,"To celebrate handing this in, I'ma get some Macca's :D"
27-12-2020T22:01:26,AspiringNoodle,Either that or Sheetz if they're closed
27-12-2020T22:01:43,CrRAR,Though it is pretty severe that everyone isn’t paying anything
27-12-2020T22:01:48,CrRAR,Oh nice
27-12-2020T22:01:59,AspiringNoodle,"Also, hopefully handing in this notice will end the constant stress headaches I've had on my days off for the past 2 weeks or so..."
27-12-2020T22:02:04,CrRAR,"I skipped pizza today, had to food shop"

27-12-2020T22:02:15,AspiringNoodle,"I tell yah, it's fun"
27-12-2020T22:02:32,AspiringNoodle,Either spending the entire day off sleeping / not enjoying it fully because of a numb tightness in the back of the head all day.
27-12-2020T22:02:49,AspiringNoodle,Or stressing about going in and being exhausted at the end of the shift :|
27-12-2020T22:03:17,AspiringNoodle,I legit had one day where I went to bed at 3 am the previous night
27-12-2020T22:04:01,AspiringNoodle,"Slept until 1pm the next day, went in to work, didn't get home until 1am, went to sleep at roughly 2, and slept until 2 the next day :\"
