03-08-2020T01:20:56,AspiringNoodle,"Lol, love it.  This channel has 6 koreans who react to cultural differences between the US and Korea and give their commentary on it"
03-08-2020T01:21:27,AspiringNoodle,"They did a video comparing US and Korean ghosts in film, and the video did so well that they listened to the comment section.  They kept using old horror films."
03-08-2020T01:21:53,AspiringNoodle,"So now they're watching modern horror films, including Lights Out. F"

03-08-2020T07:00:54,CrimsonQuill,Hi CrRAR
03-08-2020T07:07:25,CrimsonQuill,How is you
03-08-2020T08:40:55,Dadrobit,\o/ Election day
03-08-2020T08:41:13,Dadrobit,Only day of the year I turn on a TV to get news.
03-08-2020T08:48:14,CrimsonQuill,Hiya Dadrobit
03-08-2020T08:48:33,CrimsonQuill,Election day for what exactly?
03-08-2020T08:51:35,Dadrobit,Arizona Primary
03-08-2020T08:51:48,CrimsonQuill,"Oh, local politicians?"
03-08-2020T08:52:17,Dadrobit,"I mean, it's a state election."
03-08-2020T08:52:30,CrimsonQuill,I see.
03-08-2020T08:52:33,Dadrobit,Stuff like the Senate position is up for grabs
03-08-2020T08:52:50,CrimsonQuill,"Well, that would be a big day...now I get it"
03-08-2020T08:53:40,Dadrobit,Getting that unelected loser fuckswab McSally out finally.
03-08-2020T08:54:05,Dadrobit,Infuruating beyond belief that she has her position
03-08-2020T08:59:02,CrimsonQuill,We have an altogether different problem where I live
03-08-2020T08:59:27,CrimsonQuill,Fíanna Fáil and Fine Gáel are in a coalition that is nevertheless...fragile.
03-08-2020T08:59:42,CrimsonQuill,And the Independents are not very happy about 'speaking restrictions'
03-08-2020T09:00:14,CrimsonQuill,"I hardly know anything about politics though, which is a problem when I'm trying to figure out who's the least-worst person to vote for"
03-08-2020T09:03:06,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I'm taking the husband of local legendand literal astronaut Mark Kelly over the idiot hate-puppet who lost her election and was fucking gifted her position anyways."
03-08-2020T09:04:37,CrimsonQuill,"I'm just going to say, good luck with those elections, because I am very scared of taking a side when I live over 3000 miles away."
03-08-2020T09:08:06,Dadrobit,I got my ballot in 5 days ago and it's all verified and in. Initial numbers have Kelly smashing McSally.
03-08-2020T09:08:16,Dadrobit,Cannot goddamn wait
03-08-2020T09:09:57,CrimsonQuill,Looking good for you then
03-08-2020T09:10:15,Dadrobit,I've been giddy for weeks
03-08-2020T09:11:11,CrimsonQuill,Ok
03-08-2020T09:23:12,CrimsonQuill,soooo
03-08-2020T09:23:33,CrimsonQuill,anyone know any good krita tutorials?
03-08-2020T09:23:54,CrimsonQuill,"I did do a little doodle of my Chonky Halo boi, but it was...rudimentary."

03-08-2020T09:29:29,TerraTheWizard,beard
03-08-2020T09:29:55,CrimsonQuill,Uuuumm...yeah...about that...
03-08-2020T09:30:23,TerraTheWizard,also i'm not sure how much tutorials will help
03-08-2020T09:30:27,CrimsonQuill,uuuummm...I just randomly picked brushes...
03-08-2020T09:30:43,TerraTheWizard,i've been using krita for image editing and it's by far the most klunky software i use
03-08-2020T09:31:10,TerraTheWizard,the way the tools work is just bad
03-08-2020T09:31:18,TerraTheWizard,and the hotkeys are terrible
03-08-2020T09:31:25,CrimsonQuill,There are hotkeys?
03-08-2020T09:31:44,CrimsonQuill,"Just, my tablet doesn't have any of those buttons on the side"
03-08-2020T09:31:49,TerraTheWizard,ctrl+y is supposed to be redo
03-08-2020T09:31:53,TerraTheWizard,not in krita
03-08-2020T09:32:01,CrimsonQuill,...I am very scared now.
03-08-2020T09:32:11,TerraTheWizard,also ctrl+t is supposed to be transform tool
03-08-2020T09:32:12,TerraTheWizard,it isn't
03-08-2020T09:32:19,CrimsonQuill,I feel like I'm going to have to learn to draw all over again
03-08-2020T09:32:29,TerraTheWizard,ctrl+t is bound to like 7 things
03-08-2020T09:32:31,TerraTheWizard,7
03-08-2020T09:32:39,CrimsonQuill,Jesus wept
03-08-2020T09:33:05,TerraTheWizard,"i'm not sure how good gimp is these days, but i think that's more geared to editing"
03-08-2020T09:33:22,TerraTheWizard,2 free art programs i do recommend are: medibang paint pro
03-08-2020T09:33:27,TerraTheWizard,or firealpaca
03-08-2020T09:33:34,CrimsonQuill,Mine is more total drawing
03-08-2020T09:33:48,CrimsonQuill,"Just, using it like a sketchpad"
03-08-2020T09:33:57,CrimsonQuill,I want to be good at traditional art in one hand
03-08-2020T09:34:03,CrimsonQuill,and good at digital art in the other
03-08-2020T09:34:17,TerraTheWizard,2 drawings at the same time :ctwokinds-keith8D:
03-08-2020T09:34:53,CrimsonQuill,:ptv-laugh: I wish! I'm sadly not ambidexterous...nor do I have much multitasking capability...
03-08-2020T09:35:11,CrimsonQuill,I'll check those programs out though.
03-08-2020T09:43:26,TerraTheWizard,i use clip studio paint
03-08-2020T09:43:32,TerraTheWizard,but that's one-time payment
03-08-2020T09:43:40,CrimsonQuill,Oh
03-08-2020T09:43:47,CrimsonQuill,Winterspec uses that one
03-08-2020T09:43:53,CrimsonQuill,...tempted now
03-08-2020T09:43:57,TerraTheWizard,though i still do most of my image editing on software from 2003
03-08-2020T09:44:03,TerraTheWizard,because i know how it works
03-08-2020T09:44:04,CrimsonQuill,XD

03-08-2020T09:45:00,TerraTheWizard,because you can't get it legit because adobe forces you into their subscription bs
03-08-2020T09:45:10,CrimsonQuill,Oh dear
03-08-2020T09:45:28,TerraTheWizard,but yea
03-08-2020T09:45:38,TerraTheWizard,praise be to windows backwards compaitbility
03-08-2020T09:53:03,Dadrobit,Jesus wept lol
03-08-2020T09:53:11,Dadrobit,Allow me to introduce you to Pro Tools
03-08-2020T09:53:18,CrimsonQuill,Pro tools?
03-08-2020T09:53:20,Dadrobit,70 odd pages of hotkeys
03-08-2020T09:53:29,Dadrobit,http://resources.avid.com/SupportFiles/PT/Pro_Tools_Shortcuts_12.8.2.pdf
03-08-2020T09:53:36,CrimsonQuill,A Maire Máthair!
03-08-2020T09:53:45,CrimsonQuill,Whatg even is that?!
03-08-2020T09:53:51,Dadrobit,Digital Audio Workstation
03-08-2020T09:54:12,CrimsonQuill,...help
03-08-2020T09:54:38,Dadrobit,"Truthfully, I only have a couple dozen committed to heart."
03-08-2020T09:54:55,Dadrobit,But shortcut keys are your best friend no matter the program
03-08-2020T09:55:22,CrimsonQuill,...I have a long way to go...
03-08-2020T09:56:30,Dadrobit,Being able to instantly commit an action instead of right clicking/dragdown menu searching is like using a calculator on a maths test with a cheatsheet of common equations while everyone else works with a pencil and scratch paper from memory
03-08-2020T09:56:51,Dadrobit,It's efficiency you can~feel~
03-08-2020T09:57:10,TerraTheWizard,nice
03-08-2020T09:57:22,TerraTheWizard,"also on the hotkey front, if you ever get into blender stuff"
03-08-2020T09:57:30,TerraTheWizard,you *need* the hotkeys
03-08-2020T09:57:50,TerraTheWizard,because otherwise you're constantly going 6 tabs deep in cascading menus
03-08-2020T09:59:23,Dadrobit,"When I was taking classes on Pro Tools, the final exam was to sit one on one with the instructor and set up and navigate a session in the program without using the mouse almost at all. 95% of the exam it was both hands on the keyboard being as efficient"
03-08-2020T09:59:31,Dadrobit,with hotkeys as you possibly could
03-08-2020T10:00:22,Dadrobit,"""Be so efficient that you're waiting on the client. If the client has to wait on you because you're wasting time searching with a mouse, then you're losing a client."""
03-08-2020T10:00:54,Dadrobit,"He was a hardass professor, but he was fantastic at what he did."
03-08-2020T10:01:28,Dadrobit,Dude was professional to the core.
03-08-2020T10:01:42,CrimsonQuill,"Wow....so, is that just editing?"
03-08-2020T10:02:01,Dadrobit,The exam? Or Pro Tools in general?
03-08-2020T10:02:48,CrimsonQuill,Pro tools in general
03-08-2020T10:05:15,Dadrobit,"It does everything audio. Recording, editing, setting it to video. Whatever you can imagine you can do to audio plus a bunch that you didn't know you could."
03-08-2020T10:07:03,CrimsonQuill,"Wow...so when you say shortcuts are essential, that would go for drawing as well, wouldn't it?"
03-08-2020T10:08:17,Dadrobit,for sure
03-08-2020T10:09:06,CrimsonQuill,Wow...I wonder how long it'll take before I'm as good as Winterspec or Tom...

03-08-2020T12:24:25,CrimsonQuill,'Cause I've been dealing with a hyperactive kitten most of the day

03-08-2020T12:52:54,CrimsonQuill,That is heart-rending.
03-08-2020T12:54:55,CrimsonQuill,At least they should have a decent home now.
03-08-2020T13:45:50,TheSexyBeast,Warm body + fur + low melting point = bath time.
03-08-2020T13:49:05,CrimsonQuill,"Bath time? I prefer showers, tbh"
03-08-2020T13:49:09,CrimsonQuill,They're quicker
03-08-2020T13:49:34,Dadrobit,"Huh, I've had this TV for like 4+ years now, and I'm just now discovering that it comes with like 100+ free channels."
03-08-2020T13:50:16,Dadrobit,Literally only turn it on to watch actual TV once every election cycle on local news.
03-08-2020T13:51:48,Dadrobit,"The free channels of course mean nothing, still not watching regular TV, but it is kinda cool Samsung does it."
03-08-2020T13:52:59,CrimsonQuill,Okee

03-08-2020T20:31:12,Ordithus,"newer controllers work on most games, some old games require old controllers"
03-08-2020T20:31:38,Ordithus,my xbox 360 style controller works great for most stuff
03-08-2020T20:31:59,SpazztasticKiwi,what kind of sense does that make
03-08-2020T20:32:39,Ordithus,sorry for trying to help
03-08-2020T20:35:46,SpazztasticKiwi,I mean the controllers
03-08-2020T20:37:15,Ordithus,probably don't have to worry about it
03-08-2020T20:37:31,SpazztasticKiwi,“will you work on this game?” 🎮:🤷🏻‍♀️
03-08-2020T20:39:02,Ordithus,I remember having to buy that controller to play Bastion
03-08-2020T20:41:42,SpazztasticKiwi,the actual steam controller or is the controller emoji actually based on a real controller & isn’t a generic gameboy rip off
03-08-2020T20:42:29,Ordithus,you don't need a steam controller
03-08-2020T20:44:59,SpazztasticKiwi,I wouldn’t guess so because it calls for bluetooth & there’s plenty of toys with bluetooth
03-08-2020T20:48:46,SpazztasticKiwi,I used my phones bluetooth at my friends wedding for music
03-08-2020T20:49:05,SpazztasticKiwi,they had a speaker but their internet device was fading fast and needed life support
03-08-2020T20:50:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"now if it’s on and my phone detects it, I can connect and play anything I want"
03-08-2020T20:52:43,Ordithus,such potential for mischief
03-08-2020T21:00:29,CrRAR,So basically you get your own theme music anytime you visit.
03-08-2020T21:00:35,CrRAR,wow
03-08-2020T21:01:09,CrRAR,Have you ever considered doing the Seinfeld intro? xD

03-08-2020T22:26:28,SpazztasticKiwi,I think I messed up assembling my kitten
03-08-2020T22:26:39,SpazztasticKiwi,he’s all wonky
03-08-2020T22:31:27,CrRAR,Just came to check in on him
03-08-2020T22:31:32,CrRAR,He’s so flopsy!

03-08-2020T22:37:04,SpazztasticKiwi,he’s settled himself in the corner on my pillow
03-08-2020T22:39:06,CrRAR,He’s defending his sacred sleepy spot
03-08-2020T22:42:26,CrRAR,Actually you really rescued him from the hot pavement right? Was that why you think he was hiding in the wheelwell?
03-08-2020T22:42:30,CrRAR,:feet:

03-08-2020T22:49:28,SpazztasticKiwi,he had to be in there when the guy drove there
03-08-2020T23:05:07,AspiringNoodle,Just watched a video about 10 kinds of injuries you can get while gaming
03-08-2020T23:05:22,AspiringNoodle,The sad part?  The more serious ones all had stories coming out of east Asia
03-08-2020T23:06:05,AspiringNoodle,"""Person [x] suffered injury [y] after a [z] hour gaming session."" Basically"
03-08-2020T23:06:34,CrRAR,"Huh, that actually reminds me of those stories where a dog/cat/deer is hit by a car and gets stuck in the bumper cuz it broke through the plastic."
03-08-2020T23:06:41,CrRAR,haha
03-08-2020T23:07:17,CrRAR,In lots of those cases the come out pretty fine surprisingly
03-08-2020T23:07:45,CrRAR,*they
03-08-2020T23:08:29,CrRAR,"Maybe lots of repetitive motion injuries, noodle?"
03-08-2020T23:08:50,CrRAR,Probably some more wacky unexpected ones tho too
03-08-2020T23:12:15,CrRAR,Maybe the kitty chased a chipmunk or mouse or something into the car paneling but then forgot how to get out xD
03-08-2020T23:12:48,CrRAR,"Newer cars have so much plastic shielding now, it’s absurd"
03-08-2020T23:12:53,CrRAR,Like a maze
03-08-2020T23:13:24,CrRAR,Gives a fun little stowaway platform basically
03-08-2020T23:14:14,AspiringNoodle,Gamer paralyzed from the legs down after 20 hour gaming session
03-08-2020T23:14:27,AspiringNoodle,Gamer blind in right eye after 24 hour mobile binge
03-08-2020T23:14:37,CrRAR,Oh crap
03-08-2020T23:14:58,CrRAR,Yeah long duration sitting can lead to clots
03-08-2020T23:14:58,AspiringNoodle,"Seriously man, every time, EVERY, TIME, a gamer suffers a serious injury or death from gaming, this shiz comes from China or Korea"
03-08-2020T23:15:18,AspiringNoodle,Because these people have such a problem that they will spend DAYS in a gaming cafe
03-08-2020T23:15:46,AspiringNoodle,"There's a mother in south america who's son is so addicted, she honestly needs to cut him off, and get the gaming cafe to cut him off"
03-08-2020T23:16:05,AspiringNoodle,He will get so zoned into his games that you can't snap him out of it unless you rip him away from the computer
03-08-2020T23:16:39,AspiringNoodle,"he won't eat, he won't use the restroom.  He will be so hyperfocused on the game that it's all he notices"
03-08-2020T23:16:58,CrRAR,"The internet is both a great resource, and great detriment. Can be abused like anything else."
03-08-2020T23:17:22,AspiringNoodle,"Honestly, when I think *I* have a gaming problem, these stories remind me that nah, I don't really have it xD"
03-08-2020T23:17:39,CrRAR,haha
03-08-2020T23:17:47,AspiringNoodle,I'm guilty of overindulgence
03-08-2020T23:17:52,AspiringNoodle,These people are straight addicts
03-08-2020T23:18:35,CrRAR,"I guess if it’s all you know plus lots of those tournaments are for monies, right?"
03-08-2020T23:18:45,AspiringNoodle,"Also, thanks to that video, I might be able to explain the subtle pain in my shoulder, haha"
03-08-2020T23:18:53,AspiringNoodle,"""Mouse shoulder"" is apparently a thing"
03-08-2020T23:19:17,CrRAR,g r e a t
03-08-2020T23:19:37,AspiringNoodle,"And sadly, most of these people aren't playing for a profession.  Most, anyways"
03-08-2020T23:20:03,AspiringNoodle,"I remember reading about a girl in China who disappeared and 3 years later, it turned out she was living in an internet / gaming cafe"
03-08-2020T23:20:04,SpazztasticKiwi,there are levels to addiction
03-08-2020T23:20:12,CrRAR,"Oh right, they mostly just spend money on in game goodies"
03-08-2020T23:20:15,SpazztasticKiwi,you can still have it but not be extreme
03-08-2020T23:20:18,CrRAR,Indeed
03-08-2020T23:20:32,AspiringNoodle,"Turns out she was *so* good at a given competitive shooter, she was getting hired to coach or boost accounts"
03-08-2020T23:20:45,AspiringNoodle,And she made enough money to live in that cafe
03-08-2020T23:21:37,CrRAR,Someday maybe BUY the cafe
03-08-2020T23:21:45,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-adiracoin:
03-08-2020T23:22:48,AspiringNoodle,It's kinda sad
03-08-2020T23:23:04,AspiringNoodle,"While there has never been a greater time to be a professional gamer, it's also never been more volatile"
03-08-2020T23:23:30,CrRAR,"Yeah, well, there’s so much saturation at this point"
03-08-2020T23:23:44,AspiringNoodle,I'd argue that they've done poor jobs maintaining their games
03-08-2020T23:23:48,AspiringNoodle,overwatch is a prime example
03-08-2020T23:24:01,CrRAR,"If EVERYONE can game, no one GOT game~"
03-08-2020T23:24:02,AspiringNoodle,"Overwatch is the ""How to NOT"" example of a competitive shooter"
03-08-2020T23:24:21,CrRAR,"Eh, eventually they just pander to the masses"
03-08-2020T23:24:23,AspiringNoodle,"Poor balancing choices, complete neglection of power creep.  Nonsensical tuning"
03-08-2020T23:24:44,AspiringNoodle,On top of that. SLOW.  We're talking stuff can be broken for months if not YEARS
03-08-2020T23:24:57,AspiringNoodle,The dive meta in overwatch lasted over a year
03-08-2020T23:25:07,AspiringNoodle,And then that was followed up by GOATS for just as long
03-08-2020T23:25:22,CrRAR,Like I think they realized all the minecraft kiddies grew up and the bar was low and wanted other “more mature” platforms for them to flood into
03-08-2020T23:25:53,CrRAR,Like the whole dancing mechanics in shooters just pissed me off
03-08-2020T23:25:57,AspiringNoodle,"Also, cheating is a *major* problem right now"
03-08-2020T23:26:26,CrRAR,I mean it’s kind of charming for like 2 mins but... wut
03-08-2020T23:26:32,AspiringNoodle,Every single company that makes anti-cheat does so in such a way that they're just trying to flex their muscles and show how great of a learning system they can implement...
03-08-2020T23:26:40,AspiringNoodle,"Also, dancing mechanics?"
03-08-2020T23:27:29,CrRAR,Like in Destiny and Fortnite I guess?
03-08-2020T23:27:48,CrRAR,That’s when I knew Bungie lost their way. xD
03-08-2020T23:28:01,CrRAR,"I was like “aight, I’m out” lol"
03-08-2020T23:28:28,AspiringNoodle,It's... it's not even a core part of the game...
03-08-2020T23:28:36,AspiringNoodle,It's just a flavor feature for those who are interested...
03-08-2020T23:29:34,CrRAR,"Yeah I know, but it just is a overall hint at where the company culture went"
03-08-2020T23:30:22,AspiringNoodle,"I mean, it's such a small part of the game, too"
03-08-2020T23:30:31,AspiringNoodle,It's just something for their animators to do to kill time
03-08-2020T23:30:55,AspiringNoodle,WoW has had a dancing emote since the very beginning
03-08-2020T23:31:09,CrRAR,"I know, I know, just “small parts” of games used to be easter eggs and cheat codes and originality"
03-08-2020T23:32:52,CrRAR,Back when Frank O’ Connor was part of Bungie and did the weekly updates and whatnot they would explore different parts of game making through interviews and discussion and passion
03-08-2020T23:33:32,CrRAR,"You could tell they were, internally, excited just as much to share the making of the game, while making the game."
03-08-2020T23:34:37,CrRAR,Plus all those ‘Mister Chiefs’. I wonder if those are archived somewhere. xD
03-08-2020T23:35:22,AspiringNoodle,"I have the original destiny, just never played it :ptv-laugh:"
03-08-2020T23:35:34,AspiringNoodle,And now Destiny 2 is this giant live service
03-08-2020T23:35:42,AspiringNoodle,Not sure if they'll ever pull a Destiny 2 and make a Destiny 3
03-08-2020T23:37:46,CrRAR,"Yeah, Bungie broke back free, but supposedly the ownership by Activision did some damage to their franchise direction/story"
03-08-2020T23:38:54,CrRAR,"They took the Best part of Bungie, its lore and mystery, and turned it into a gimmick where you discover no real story just keep grinding/playing going “Where’s the story, I expect there to be a story”"
03-08-2020T23:39:06,CrRAR,*drops hint of a story element*
03-08-2020T23:39:25,CrRAR,*more endless grinding/play*
03-08-2020T23:39:42,CrRAR,Basically like a giant hampster wheel
03-08-2020T23:39:42,AspiringNoodle,Activision is a cancer
03-08-2020T23:39:45,CrRAR,Yup
03-08-2020T23:39:51,AspiringNoodle,I dread the day they take Blizzard with them
03-08-2020T23:40:14,AspiringNoodle,Hopefully Blizzard could find some investors willing to get it back on its feet and they can reconnect with what made them great in the first place
03-08-2020T23:40:22,AspiringNoodle,"That said, Shadowlands shows promise"
03-08-2020T23:40:34,CrRAR,"Who knew activision could turn the galaxies greatest weapon, Halo, into a giant hamster wheel. xD"
03-08-2020T23:41:00,CrRAR,Maybe THAT’S what “The Traveller” was
03-08-2020T23:41:10,CrRAR,A GIANT hampster ball xD
03-08-2020T23:41:20,CrRAR,Bungie KNEW
03-08-2020T23:41:53,CrRAR,"“ALRIGHT KIDDIES, everyone pile on inside!”"
03-08-2020T23:42:05,CrRAR,“WHEEEEEEEE”
03-08-2020T23:43:16,CrRAR,Meanwhile srs gamers who cared about Bungie’s nariritive prowess: :ccrrar-reni:
03-08-2020T23:43:21,CrRAR,“NOOOOOOOOOO”
03-08-2020T23:43:39,CrRAR,“I want off Mr. Activision’s Wild RIDE!”
03-08-2020T23:44:02,AspiringNoodle,Bobby Kotick needs to suck part of his namesake and eff off already
03-08-2020T23:44:11,CrRAR,lul
03-08-2020T23:44:31,AspiringNoodle,That man has destroyed the quality and integrity of so many damn franchises
03-08-2020T23:44:37,AspiringNoodle,He doesn't want game development to be fun
03-08-2020T23:44:41,AspiringNoodle,He doesn't want games to be fun
03-08-2020T23:44:52,SpazztasticKiwi,🍿
03-08-2020T23:45:04,AspiringNoodle,He just wants an efficient mill churning out garbage games that will rake in money hand over fist
03-08-2020T23:46:17,CrRAR,"Yup, a stunning spawn probably of overall EA mindset"
03-08-2020T23:46:43,CrRAR,“Let’s figure out how to synthesise FUN”
03-08-2020T23:46:56,AspiringNoodle,"Also, dude's one of the most overpaid CEO's in the entire world"
03-08-2020T23:47:28,AspiringNoodle,"He is compensated almost 10x as much as the CEO of Sony, whose entire company generates 10x the revenue of Activision"
03-08-2020T23:47:49,AspiringNoodle,How in the living hell can ANYONE justify his compensation
03-08-2020T23:48:37,CrRAR,Yeah it doesn’t make any sense
03-08-2020T23:49:14,CrRAR,Just because a given company just so sits on a larger pile of cash than another company someone can make more money
03-08-2020T23:50:10,AspiringNoodle,Hopefully activist investors can change the entire economy
03-08-2020T23:50:27,AspiringNoodle,"Reduce overall compensation of CEOs, protect the rights / pay / benefits of workers"
03-08-2020T23:50:36,CrRAR,"It’s really unfair when naturally a less lucrative industry, which may not be an less work being CEO, just arbitrarially pays order of magnitudes less because cosmic luck basically"
03-08-2020T23:51:19,AspiringNoodle,"Because, and I shit you not, last year, Activision-Blizzard celebrated their best year yet in 2018"
03-08-2020T23:51:26,AspiringNoodle,New record profits
03-08-2020T23:51:26,CrRAR,"Just like how I mean atheletes work hard, but do they deserve the money they get, no, not really"
03-08-2020T23:51:30,AspiringNoodle,Immediately lays off 800 people
03-08-2020T23:51:57,CrRAR,"Yeah, more and more gamers doing more and more microtransactions"
03-08-2020T23:52:38,AspiringNoodle,"It pisses me off because developers are overworked, underpaid, companies never shut the hell up about ""how expensive"" making games is, and how much money they rake in from a game"
03-08-2020T23:52:44,AspiringNoodle,But then proceed to give the developers none of that money
03-08-2020T23:53:17,CrRAR,Yeah it’s like the age old battle of music artists vs record labels
03-08-2020T23:53:29,AspiringNoodle,"""Overwatch 3 just generated 10 billion dollars in its first year! As thanks, we have given each of our employees a coupon for a free happy meal from Mcdonald's."""
03-08-2020T23:53:50,CrRAR,The record lable has no talent just acts as the gate to the means of production and reach
03-08-2020T23:53:52,AspiringNoodle,"""D... did you give them pay raises?  Or a bonus?"""
03-08-2020T23:53:56,AspiringNoodle,"""Why? We gave them the coupon."""
03-08-2020T23:54:05,CrRAR,lol
03-08-2020T23:54:18,AspiringNoodle,Modern day corporations in a nutshell
03-08-2020T23:54:21,CrRAR,I would want at least a damn hash brown
03-08-2020T23:54:37,CrRAR,WHERES mah hash BROWN
03-08-2020T23:55:52,AspiringNoodle,"Personally, if I became the CEO of a company, I would try to keep it private"
03-08-2020T23:56:00,CrRAR,Crap now I’m getting hungry
03-08-2020T23:56:07,CrRAR,:ptv-uneasy:
03-08-2020T23:56:14,AspiringNoodle,"And if I *ever* had to go public, I would try to return things to the status quo of decades ago"
03-08-2020T23:56:26,AspiringNoodle,No more of this bs 93 - 7 split of profits
03-08-2020T23:57:05,AspiringNoodle,"And if the investors / shareholders ever tried to have me removed because I refuse to dump nearly all profits into their pockets, I would take it to court"
03-08-2020T23:57:19,CrRAR,If you make part of your vision to include caring for the customers or quality of product and have a governing board and whatnorthat agrees it can work
03-08-2020T23:57:25,AspiringNoodle,This unparalleled level of greed is what will destroy the economy in the near future
03-08-2020T23:57:26,CrRAR,Amazon was like that
03-08-2020T23:57:57,CrRAR,They always “left a seat open” to represent the unrepresented customer at board meetings
03-08-2020T23:58:14,AspiringNoodle,"heck, I might even try incorporating some of Germany's legal requirements"
03-08-2020T23:58:19,CrRAR,So as to include them into their decision making process
03-08-2020T23:58:32,AspiringNoodle,You need something like 20 or 25% of your board filled with employee-approved appointees
03-08-2020T23:58:50,CrRAR,Which works becaus ethe more catered to the more the subscriptions they would get the bigger amazon would grow
03-08-2020T23:59:18,CrRAR,So caring about the customer was their key to money money money
03-08-2020T23:59:38,AspiringNoodle,"Sadly, many investors / shareholders want sustained indefinite growth"
03-08-2020T23:59:44,CrRAR,Not so much the employees tho now ;_;
03-08-2020T23:59:51,AspiringNoodle,"And if you don't cater to that, they will take matters to court to get you removed"
03-08-2020T23:59:58,CrRAR,Yeah they attack something eventually
