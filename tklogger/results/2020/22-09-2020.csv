22-09-2020T02:31:21,Dadrobit,"Man, Tom... These two are not very good bois...."
22-09-2020T02:34:51,Dadrobit,I'm starting to think Clovis didn't hire them just for their good looks.

22-09-2020T02:37:16,Dadrobit,Fuck*
22-09-2020T02:37:38,SpazztasticKiwi,ü¶Ü
22-09-2020T02:38:02,SpazztasticKiwi,immediately what I thought of
22-09-2020T02:38:07,Twokinds,"They're not particularly nice, no."
22-09-2020T02:38:15,SpazztasticKiwi,and a friend showed me that back in hs
22-09-2020T02:38:42,SpazztasticKiwi,bad guys regularly host bake sales for the community tho Tom
22-09-2020T02:38:53,SpazztasticKiwi,"darn, looks like you drew em wrong"
22-09-2020T02:39:40,SpazztasticKiwi,nothing quite like a 2:30 am tweet
22-09-2020T02:40:15,Twokinds,?
22-09-2020T02:40:54,Dadrobit,"Like the old Mafia, they supplied and owned a bunch of soup kitchens and did a lot of humanitarian stuff for the local poor. So the locals wouldn't snitch on them to the police."
22-09-2020T02:42:24,SpazztasticKiwi,the comic tweet just hit
22-09-2020T02:43:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Clovis ding donging houses to leave fresh bread & all you hear when the person‚Äôs looking around for a deliverer is ‚Äúayyy forgettaboutit‚Äù
22-09-2020T02:43:36,Dadrobit,"Iirc, the modern Yakuza operates much the same way. When Japan got fucked from that Earthquake/Tsunami, the Yakuza provided the majority of relief to the people."
22-09-2020T02:44:20,SpazztasticKiwi,now what‚Äôs the question mark for
22-09-2020T02:44:48,Dadrobit,He's Wondering what you meant by drawing them wrong.
22-09-2020T02:49:54,SpazztasticKiwi,‚Äúbad guys are drawn evil & are commented on as seeming evil‚Äù
22-09-2020T02:50:44,SpazztasticKiwi,so sarcasm - hence the sarcasm that bad guys do community bake sales
22-09-2020T02:51:13,SpazztasticKiwi,ü•Å
22-09-2020T02:52:13,SpazztasticKiwi,"you said they didn‚Äôt look nice......so it‚Äôs like yeah that‚Äôs silly, the bad guys not looking nice, they usually do bake sales...."
22-09-2020T02:52:33,SpazztasticKiwi,3 am jokes
22-09-2020T02:53:58,SpazztasticKiwi,even the crickets in the audience aren‚Äôt chirping apparently
22-09-2020T02:54:03,Dadrobit,Sorry if I'm not all here. Currently reading the book Sage recommend. I can see why he is hesitant to make a comic of it for the author.
22-09-2020T02:55:09,Dadrobit,"It's not a terrible book or anything, just that it dives into sex fairly immediately. And not in the way that you can just fade to black with to conceal."
22-09-2020T02:57:42,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve got my taste of romance novels but what I read is often....plotty you know
22-09-2020T02:58:02,SpazztasticKiwi,with syfy and it‚Äôs own alien worlds and creatures
22-09-2020T02:58:15,SpazztasticKiwi,or a future or dystopian world
22-09-2020T02:58:50,SpazztasticKiwi,one of my favorite creatures from one was a red squirrel like animal that was colored like a pomegranate
22-09-2020T02:59:31,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs hunting strategy was one would sit in the forest floor until another animal picked it up thinking it‚Äôs food and out came a flood of the creatures
22-09-2020T03:00:09,Dadrobit,"Yeah, it's not OVERLY focused on the sex. It's just kinda a plot device to establish how young the new man is. The first is his first time as an awkward night of love with an old friend. The second is just lust from a servant pleasuring him in a bath."
22-09-2020T03:00:10,SpazztasticKiwi,land piranhas
22-09-2020T03:00:41,Dadrobit,Showing the protagonist as a village rube who never thought such open lust was possit.
22-09-2020T03:00:41,SpazztasticKiwi,I loved the idea of such an animal - never ever want to know of one or see one on this planet but awesome
22-09-2020T03:00:45,Dadrobit,Possible*
22-09-2020T03:01:35,Dadrobit,Land piranha. Makes me think of something like tiny monitor lizards swarming.

22-09-2020T03:09:32,SpazztasticKiwi,a story that wants to jump right into ‚Äúlet‚Äôs find a flat surface‚Äù? naaah
22-09-2020T03:10:38,Dadrobit,"Eh, it really wasn't a giant part of the plot, like, there's no real romance yet. It was just an affirmation that the protagonist is just barely a man."

22-09-2020T03:19:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I used to want to understand more how guys worked through time & I still don‚Äôt know but I now aren‚Äôt as interested in knowing
22-09-2020T03:19:42,SpazztasticKiwi,half because I‚Äôm not sure there‚Äôs an answer
22-09-2020T03:20:00,CrimsonQuill,'How guys worked through time'...I'm a little confused.
22-09-2020T03:20:43,SpazztasticKiwi,"if you‚Äôre anything under 21, it‚Äôs not important"
22-09-2020T03:27:05,SpazztasticKiwi,i read more on the female perspective of fictional actiony syfy romance
22-09-2020T03:29:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"I dropped one series immediately from that sort of scene - dudes had wings and apparently were so ovary-meltingly hot, they Had to be jumped"
22-09-2020T03:29:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"Nope‚Ñ¢Ô∏è, refunded - ain‚Äôt a man on any planet..."
22-09-2020T03:30:28,CrimsonQuill,"Nah, not interested in that stuff."
22-09-2020T03:30:47,CrimsonQuill,Watched a very good documentary on Operation Market Garden though.

22-09-2020T16:00:28,CrimsonQuill,And the Precursors were even bigger arseholes than the Forerunners.
22-09-2020T16:01:33,K3IDRAN,Forerunner #1: Let's end life as we know it
22-09-2020T16:02:27,K3IDRAN,Forerunner #2  & others: Yeah I don't care if we rie in the process

22-09-2020T16:25:49,CrimsonQuill,Goodnight all.
22-09-2020T16:25:55,CrimsonQuill,:ctwokinds-nibsdance::ctwokinds-RainezZz:
22-09-2020T16:33:23,K3IDRAN,I eonder how a Saladar would sound like
22-09-2020T17:26:48,CrRAR,"The forerunners were more a tale of desperation in that they hoped life like their would flourish once again in the aftermath of ‚Äòstarving‚Äô the flood, at least as far as I understood the Bungie-era lore."
22-09-2020T17:27:53,CrRAR,With their technological prowess even they couldn‚Äôt outright stop their overrun of the galaxy or whatever but they could stop them with great sacrifice
22-09-2020T17:29:34,CrRAR,"Of course they couldn‚Äôt account for races coming along and meddling, or how some of their technology would even degrade over time (the monitors)."
22-09-2020T17:34:23,CrRAR,Bungie loved their concept of rampancy that started way back during the Marathon days. The idea an AI could overthink itself to death or become more ‚Äúsenile‚Äù as time went on. Mendicant Bias was one of theirs that in the lore flip/flopped allegiances
22-09-2020T17:34:55,CrRAR,"misinterpreting its programming somewhat, eventually seeking redemption by assiting the Chief, indirectly."
22-09-2020T18:06:21,SpazztasticKiwi,ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhmtotallyok
22-09-2020T18:19:54,K3IDRAN,Halo Infinite hype reee

22-09-2020T19:20:04,CrRAR,"That does not seem to instill any feeling of okayness, spazz"
22-09-2020T20:06:36,K3IDRAN,Yeah
22-09-2020T20:07:01,K3IDRAN,Also Lets crank Twokinds to 11
22-09-2020T20:25:56,AspiringNoodle,"I swear, road rage / dumb driver vids on youtube are my guilty pleasure"
22-09-2020T20:27:05,AspiringNoodle,"The closest I actually ever had to an accident on the highway was when someone moved into the passing lane in front of me, even though I was pretty close and passing lane was doing 70 - 75 while travel was normally 60 - 65.  But I think"
22-09-2020T20:27:55,AspiringNoodle,"the person they were behind was doing 55 or so.  So, it's like, no big deal.  I took my foot off the gas and didn't break, thinking they'd speed up.  Then they put on their brakes, lol."
22-09-2020T20:28:50,AspiringNoodle,"Turns out some vehicle had lost their cargo a while ago, and there were a bunch of metal pipes in the middle of the damn highway.  So proceed to me and 3 other vehicles in the passing lane pulling off into the median to check for any tired damage."
22-09-2020T20:29:58,AspiringNoodle,Fun day.  I swear that particular stretch of highway was a magnet for accidents.

22-09-2020T21:03:41,Dadrobit,It's huge.
22-09-2020T21:03:43,AspiringNoodle,"No Man's Sky was a disaster at launch, but they hunkered down, put their nose to the grindstone and got to work.  And now the game is a damned good one."
22-09-2020T21:04:19,AspiringNoodle,It's a shame bigger AAA companies aren't capable of the same thing
22-09-2020T21:04:29,AspiringNoodle,Except for Blizzard.  You know.  #SmallIndieCompany

22-09-2020T21:30:13,AspiringNoodle,"Also, there's a guy called Smooth McGroove who plays in Acapella.  Those are always a treat~"

22-09-2020T21:47:09,AspiringNoodle,Man... Hopes and Dreams makes me want to bust out my violin

22-09-2020T21:56:11,AspiringNoodle,"Toby's crowdfunding goals got blown out of the water, and then he sold enough copies where he could easily retire early."
22-09-2020T23:34:42,SpazztasticKiwi,I love these pants but they‚Äôre trying to suffocate my legs
