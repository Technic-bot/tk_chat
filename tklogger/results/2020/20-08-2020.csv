20-08-2020T20:42:54,Ordithus,"Sorry, Ron."
20-08-2020T20:42:57,Nekonny,"he hasn't been doing well for a long time now, but he's entered that  ""final days"" stage"
20-08-2020T20:43:08,Grip,Oh no :(
20-08-2020T20:43:18,BadFoMo,I'm sorry.
20-08-2020T20:43:20,Nekonny,so although I have things that need to do like patreon and art for the site
20-08-2020T20:43:25,CrimsonHelsing,Hey everyone!
20-08-2020T20:43:31,BadFoMo,Hi.
20-08-2020T20:43:31,Nekonny,it's been hard for me to really sit down to do it
20-08-2020T20:43:32,Ordithus,Hi Crimson
20-08-2020T20:43:34,MoonDance,My condolences to you and the family
20-08-2020T20:43:43,Nekonny,and the stuff I get done feels a bit subpar
20-08-2020T20:43:44,KipArto,that song about how much the guy loves his.... servant?
20-08-2020T20:43:51,Tharkis,totally understandable.  Dont push yourself too hard.
20-08-2020T20:44:03,CrRAR,^
20-08-2020T20:44:14,Ordithus,Take time if you need to
20-08-2020T20:44:25,CrRAR,:eyes: that must be a girlMike
20-08-2020T20:44:27,Nekonny,I'll have to write to the patreon and apologize because this months gonna be late
20-08-2020T20:44:35,SageSaga,"Kip - that was probably ""you'll be back"" from Hamilton"
20-08-2020T20:44:49,Ordithus,I finally saw that last week!  So good
20-08-2020T20:44:52,BadFoMo,They should understand.
20-08-2020T20:45:01,KipArto,"lol, I really need to see Hamilton"
20-08-2020T20:45:16,Nekonny,been spending a lot of time there as well
20-08-2020T20:45:20,Grip,Take it easy Nekonny and sorry too hear.
20-08-2020T20:45:25,MoonDance,"You do what best for you, nekonny. It'll be understanding"
20-08-2020T20:45:35,Nekonny,"other than that, at my regular job, just trying to keep busy and distracted"
20-08-2020T20:45:50,thestooge2222,"Some of the songs I've heard are pretty good, but over all Hamilton looks kinda cringe :/"
20-08-2020T20:46:07,Pwatcher67,hi all
20-08-2020T20:46:12,BadFoMo,Yo.
20-08-2020T20:46:20,Nekonny,"I did take today off though, so it helped a bit"
20-08-2020T20:46:24,Ordithus,yep that's a Mike
20-08-2020T20:46:25,CustomInk,You kinda need to listen or watch all of Hamilton to understand the appeal
20-08-2020T20:46:30,ZRO4825,"lol, is that Blue looking at an article and thinking even she wouldn't wear it in public?"
20-08-2020T20:46:37,SageSaga,Hamilton was great- not sure how anyone could say it looks cringe
20-08-2020T20:47:13,Ordithus,"well, -was- Mike"
20-08-2020T20:47:17,SageSaga,Zro -pretty much
20-08-2020T20:47:19,CustomInk,I assume by hearing only some of the songs
20-08-2020T20:47:26,KipArto,lol
20-08-2020T20:47:26,CrRAR,he got BETTER
20-08-2020T20:47:36,Zakuru,oh my who is this???
20-08-2020T20:47:45,CrRAR,girlsy Mike
20-08-2020T20:47:55,KipArto,holy fuck I need to draw something
20-08-2020T20:47:58,Zakuru,:cupid:
20-08-2020T20:48:02,BadFoMo,Fem-Mike got a new hair do?
20-08-2020T20:48:05,Ordithus,girlier girly Mike
20-08-2020T20:48:18,CustomInk,Fem Mike w/ Long Hair
20-08-2020T20:48:45,MoonDance,From what helps me to relieve stress from pre grieving is trying activities that excel that energy a lot
20-08-2020T20:49:13,Nekonny,like?
20-08-2020T20:49:34,SageSaga,ive got nothing but empathy for anyone dealing with that Ron- I dont know how to handle that- I pretty much just shut down
20-08-2020T20:50:32,Nekonny,I don't really know how to handle it either
20-08-2020T20:50:54,Twokinds,"Sorry to hera it, Ron."
20-08-2020T20:50:58,Nekonny,I'm sure that at some point I'll break down; hasn't happened yet though
20-08-2020T20:51:03,Twokinds,I buried myself in work.
20-08-2020T20:51:13,Nekonny,talking about it helps a bit
20-08-2020T20:51:18,CrRAR,"Yeah, I feel like talking about the good times and reminiscing is the best you can do when able."
20-08-2020T20:51:24,Nekonny,I think work helped yeah
20-08-2020T20:51:34,Nekonny,but the activities at my regular job
20-08-2020T20:51:43,MoonDance,"in my personal experience, working out. May not be for everyone on that. But doing things like getting out the house to be with your thoughts at more peaceful environment"
20-08-2020T20:51:59,CustomInk,so like - Fishing
20-08-2020T20:52:07,BadFoMo,"I wish I had better advice than 'time heals all', but I don't. Sorry."
20-08-2020T20:52:07,MoonDance,Or perhaps a better way- do more of the activities that gives you more peace
20-08-2020T20:52:10,CrRAR,"Wow, what has Nora DONE!?"

20-08-2020T20:53:05,Nekonny,work on things that I like to do and avoid things that are frustrating
20-08-2020T20:53:12,SageSaga,i wondering what shes wearing or if shes leaned over something to do that
20-08-2020T20:53:24,Nekonny,(like backgrounds XD)
20-08-2020T20:53:37,CrRAR,:ok_hand:
20-08-2020T20:53:39,Tharkis,We burried my grandmother this last week.   She passed at the beginning of the year but with all the pandemic stuff we didnt have the funeral service till now.     I dont know if there is a given way to 'handle it'   It hurts like hell
20-08-2020T20:53:46,Nekonny,I'm not sure how one would wear such a thing sage
20-08-2020T20:53:48,SageSaga,then just draw characters- do storyboards- do everything you enjoy
20-08-2020T20:53:48,Tharkis,but just know that we're all here for you
20-08-2020T20:53:52,CrRAR,ow tharkis
20-08-2020T20:53:58,Nekonny,thanks tharkis
20-08-2020T20:54:00,Tharkis,so take your time and do what you need to
20-08-2020T20:54:03,CrRAR,that really makes that tougher
20-08-2020T20:54:08,BadFoMo,I'm sorry.

20-08-2020T20:54:24,SageSaga,I was talking about Tom's picture
20-08-2020T20:54:40,Nekonny,oh ^^
20-08-2020T20:54:43,CustomInk,I love how Tom draws long hair
20-08-2020T20:54:47,CrRAR,"Nora (to Mike): ""You alone will ensure some Keidran blood survives"""
20-08-2020T20:54:55,CrRAR,soon *1000 foxy babies*
20-08-2020T20:55:00,SageSaga,if shes nude and standing up straight the boobs would fall to the outer sides
20-08-2020T20:55:08,Nekonny,I still have the same question about your drawing though
20-08-2020T20:55:14,CustomInk,unless she has her arms crossed
20-08-2020T20:55:18,CustomInk,?
20-08-2020T20:55:21,Ordithus,"given this is Tom drawing female Mike, nude is assured"
20-08-2020T20:55:29,SageSaga,"not inward- so it would have to be a dress/outfit doing it- or leaning over, or- yeah something like the arms holding them there"
20-08-2020T20:56:03,CustomInk,"Honestly, we'll see when we get there"
20-08-2020T20:56:07,CrRAR,^
20-08-2020T20:56:15,CustomInk,*then* the Councill will decide Tom's fate
20-08-2020T20:56:25,BadFoMo,"@CrRAR I wanted to make a similar joke, but couldn't find a good time."
