11-12-2020T00:00:01,SageSaga,black and white are not colors- they are values
11-12-2020T00:00:10,Ordithus,"are they advanced mosquitos, like the Minnesota state bird?"
11-12-2020T00:00:16,NezumiYuki,Yes true
11-12-2020T00:00:20,Ordithus,"step outside in July, instantly lose all blood?"
11-12-2020T00:00:26,NezumiYuki,@Sagesaga yes true
11-12-2020T00:00:28,CrRAR,Maybe that's why hobbits evolved fuzzy feet?
11-12-2020T00:00:39,CrRAR,to avoid the mosquito foot bitesies
11-12-2020T00:00:40,unsteddyphoenix,Im terrified

11-12-2020T00:02:38,Dadrobit,"That's Tom. Either they're in robes, or he draws as little clothes as possible!"
11-12-2020T00:02:40,unsteddyphoenix,I find socks and sandals uncomfortable to look at
11-12-2020T00:02:46,KeefMcDerpface,same
11-12-2020T00:03:15,InTheLionsDen,I find sandles without socks to be uncomfortable. As already mentioned they add more cushioning.
11-12-2020T00:03:48,Ordithus,"I'd go barefoot, but sharp rocks. or cold. or hot."

11-12-2020T00:07:47,Dadrobit,Walkies
11-12-2020T00:07:57,SageSaga,if i could do it without touching them that would be great
11-12-2020T00:08:15,NezumiYuki,mutts are the best or WORST alarm clocks around.  xD
11-12-2020T00:08:19,CrRAR,^
11-12-2020T00:08:28,Ordithus,"ah, so these are the unpleasant ones"
11-12-2020T00:08:28,CrRAR,yup spontaneous snuggles
11-12-2020T00:08:38,CrRAR,maybe allergies?
11-12-2020T00:08:48,CrRAR,you have allergies to them?
11-12-2020T00:09:05,SageSaga,no- just dont like these dogs
11-12-2020T00:09:17,CrRAR,"aww okay, fair haha"
11-12-2020T00:09:24,SageSaga,they smell and are covered in tumors
11-12-2020T00:09:33,CrRAR,are they obnoxious pugs?
11-12-2020T00:09:36,CrRAR,awww
11-12-2020T00:09:40,CrRAR,poor doggos
11-12-2020T00:10:00,SageSaga,so its a mixture of eew smell and feeling bad for them
11-12-2020T00:10:01,Dadrobit,Oreo can be pretty terrible about waking me up. If I sleep on the couch he will straight up drop a log on my throat to get me to play fetch with him.
11-12-2020T00:10:14,CrRAR,old dogs do get stinky and hard to care for
11-12-2020T00:10:18,Ordithus,this kills the dadro
11-12-2020T00:10:27,Dadrobit,"Oof, Sage, rough."
11-12-2020T00:10:38,Rulo6000,that is one adorable looking willow
11-12-2020T00:10:38,CrRAR,their vision probably ain't so good either
11-12-2020T00:10:47,CrRAR,:100: rulo
11-12-2020T00:10:56,Dadrobit,(He hasn't done that in a while to be fair.)

11-12-2020T00:11:18,NezumiYuki,"At least with doggos... They either plop themselves beside you, or at your feet, whereas cats... Cats will plop themselves down RIGHT ON YOU as you sleep !"
11-12-2020T00:11:29,Ordithus,depends on the dog
11-12-2020T00:11:36,Ordithus,some think you are bed
11-12-2020T00:11:45,Dadrobit,"Yuki, dogs absolutely will snuggle on top of you."
11-12-2020T00:11:48,CrRAR,Yeah I wonder if they realize that you're actually unconscious and do it intentionally
11-12-2020T00:11:56,KeefMcDerpface,:eyes: Santa hat?
11-12-2020T00:12:01,CrRAR,"or if they're just like herp, derp, FETCH!"

11-12-2020T00:12:15,NezumiYuki,Awww that christmas hat Whisp! <3
11-12-2020T00:12:15,SageSaga,crap- didnt even think about this- what do i even do if one of them dies?
11-12-2020T00:12:29,CrRAR,call the vet
11-12-2020T00:12:38,Ordithus,and the owner
11-12-2020T00:12:41,CrRAR,I think they have like pet morgues
11-12-2020T00:12:51,NezumiYuki,OMG Tom!  xDD  Santa beard too?
11-12-2020T00:12:54,KeefMcDerpface,Hah! Santa beard.
11-12-2020T00:12:55,Dadrobit,Ziplock it until the owners get back
11-12-2020T00:12:56,CrRAR,ohhhh

11-12-2020T00:13:15,CrRAR,wow morbid sage xD
11-12-2020T00:13:26,CrRAR,gotta bury 6 ft
11-12-2020T00:13:28,SageSaga,they are diggers-
11-12-2020T00:13:29,Ordithus,a vet would be able to care for the body
11-12-2020T00:13:39,Ordithus,until the owner takes it
11-12-2020T00:13:40,SageSaga,who wants to pay a vet to do that?
11-12-2020T00:14:06,Ordithus,part of the cost of having pets
11-12-2020T00:14:18,SageSaga,its not my pet-
11-12-2020T00:14:20,CrRAR,I was not aware a ectoplasmic organism could wear things
11-12-2020T00:14:36,CrRAR,"though she did ""hold"" the tinsel for the tree dressing"
11-12-2020T00:14:45,CrRAR,so makes sense!
11-12-2020T00:15:00,CrRAR,maybe it's sheer force of like telepathy
11-12-2020T00:15:13,Dadrobit,Course they can. S'why they drop loot after you slay em!
11-12-2020T00:15:26,CrRAR,haha but ;_;

11-12-2020T00:48:59,SageSaga,i had gotten a ton of my online and offline friends together and had some good news and bad news-

11-12-2020T01:42:31,SageSaga,and doesnt require material components
11-12-2020T01:43:11,SageSaga,so you just use wish to use the clone spell on yourself- and you dont need to make a vat for a body - nor  do you need to cut out a cubic inch of flesh from your body!
