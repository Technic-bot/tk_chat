13-02-2020T22:18:49,KeefMcDerpface,Maybe the autocross crossbow from Far Cry 4?
13-02-2020T22:18:49,BeeMill,Oh noooooo sage is drawing a body pillow

13-02-2020T22:19:22,Mediawatcher,But your right how come we haven‚Äôt had any cannon ships yet?

13-02-2020T22:19:37,AspiringNoodle,"Oh no, I have dropped my lurking device :ptv-shock:"
13-02-2020T22:19:41,Roughlandin,"Like I said, Media. I think magic makes cannons obsolete"
13-02-2020T22:19:42,unsteddyphoenix,Feet! Blasphemy!
13-02-2020T22:19:44,SageSaga,welcome home Ron
13-02-2020T22:19:46,AspiringNoodle,*panicked noodle noises*
13-02-2020T22:19:51,Nekonny,thanks ^^
13-02-2020T22:19:51,NezumiYuki,"For one of the cast of Twokinds to pull out a gun would be like Avatar's final showdown with Blackwolf....   ""BOOM""   nobody expected it!   xD"
13-02-2020T22:19:52,Mediawatcher,Not entirely
13-02-2020T22:19:52,BeeMill,Because real firearms would kinda ruin the fun of magic
13-02-2020T22:19:57,HoverdudeXL,Yea
13-02-2020T22:19:59,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,Hi Nekonny
13-02-2020T22:20:02,AspiringNoodle,Magic making cannons obsolete?
13-02-2020T22:20:10,CrRAR,what if they shot magic bullets?
13-02-2020T22:20:11,AspiringNoodle,Someone needs to watch the Siege of Undercity
13-02-2020T22:20:13,AspiringNoodle,mwahahahahaha
13-02-2020T22:20:23,Mediawatcher,A magic pistol
13-02-2020T22:20:27,KeefMcDerpface,But what about Bioshock? That had magic and guns.
13-02-2020T22:20:29,CrRAR,would they be fun again?
13-02-2020T22:20:38,NezumiYuki,Why shoot cannon balls when you haz Magic Missile!!!  ???
13-02-2020T22:20:42,Roughlandin,I guess it depends on how common and cheap mana crystals are
13-02-2020T22:20:47,Mediawatcher,Magic cannons
13-02-2020T22:20:48,ContagiousBordem16,Hi
13-02-2020T22:20:50,unsteddyphoenix,cannons do more damage
13-02-2020T22:20:54,KeefMcDerpface,Hello Bordem
13-02-2020T22:20:54,AspiringNoodle,Jaina Proudmoore makes all your arguments moot
13-02-2020T22:20:55,ContagiousBordem16,Page stream?
13-02-2020T22:21:01,AspiringNoodle,"She can magic a freaking ship into battle, lol"
13-02-2020T22:21:09,HoverdudeXL,No
13-02-2020T22:21:10,Roughlandin,Magic can do a good deal of damage in the TK world
13-02-2020T22:21:13,ContagiousBordem16,Cri
13-02-2020T22:21:17,Roughlandin,Like. Blow up cities damage
13-02-2020T22:21:20,CrRAR,"""STOP blowing HOLES in MY SHIP"""
13-02-2020T22:21:27,NezumiYuki,Okay then how about a Magic Katyusha?   Or Neblewhurfer?
13-02-2020T22:21:34,BeeMill,Ngl it'd be funny to see the crew get into a fight then the enemy just whips out a magic firing gun
13-02-2020T22:21:36,Roughlandin,I got a jar of di-irt!
13-02-2020T22:21:37,Mediawatcher,Tom already did that two pages ago
13-02-2020T22:21:47,ContagiousBordem16,Jack sparrow!
13-02-2020T22:21:59,KeefMcDerpface,Also Dishonered. That had guns and magic.
13-02-2020T22:22:38,ContagiousBordem16,If Maeve has a jar of dirt
13-02-2020T22:22:45,ContagiousBordem16,Had*
13-02-2020T22:22:51,NezumiYuki,"Evals is looking good, Tom!   Now do Mikey! >:3"
13-02-2020T22:22:57,MetalAppleSauce,Oh hey
13-02-2020T22:23:03,KeefMcDerpface,hello Metal
13-02-2020T22:23:06,Roughlandin,I'm not saying the two can't co-exist. I'm just saying if mana crystals are cheap and anyone can use them. Taking up cargo space and money to buy cannons seems redundant
13-02-2020T22:23:14,CrRAR,If it were the Waterworld universe a jar of dirt would fetch a pretty penny
13-02-2020T22:23:17,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-adiracoin:
13-02-2020T22:23:18,MetalAppleSauce,Mew DM'd me that he started this
13-02-2020T22:23:26,BeeMill,"Idk, Tom originally started all this with a sort of RPG vibe. I know it's not really there anymore but what kind of RPG has guns"
13-02-2020T22:23:33,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,Hi Metal
13-02-2020T22:23:37,Roughlandin,D&D has guns
13-02-2020T22:23:44,unsteddyphoenix,Some of them! tobe fair
13-02-2020T22:23:44,Mediawatcher,I really want to see that page of that self aware villager remade
13-02-2020T22:23:48,Roughlandin,It's sort of THE rpg
13-02-2020T22:23:48,KeefMcDerpface,Any JRPGs?
13-02-2020T22:23:52,Roughlandin,Fable had guns
13-02-2020T22:23:59,NezumiYuki,"Mr. Christian... Give them a broadside of Templars firing ""Magic Missile"""
13-02-2020T22:24:06,BeeMill,Well like RPG video games I meant
13-02-2020T22:24:08,BeeMill,no DnD
13-02-2020T22:24:12,Roughlandin,Fable
13-02-2020T22:24:16,KeefMcDerpface,Again JRPGs?
13-02-2020T22:24:23,Roughlandin,Final Fantasy VIII
13-02-2020T22:24:27,BeeMill,Apparently Joker has a gun in persona but that's all I know
13-02-2020T22:24:29,CrRAR,"Evals must have joined a union since, he got his tail back!"
13-02-2020T22:24:32,KeefMcDerpface,Ni No Kuni had guns.
13-02-2020T22:24:32,Roughlandin,Wow
13-02-2020T22:24:41,Roughlandin,World of Warcraft that is
13-02-2020T22:24:45,CrRAR,"dang slavers, dey terk urr taerrrbsss"
13-02-2020T22:24:47,BeeMill,Ah
13-02-2020T22:24:50,Mediawatcher,Warcraft 3 refunded
13-02-2020T22:24:57,BeeMill,Ok ok that was a bad argument
13-02-2020T22:25:03,NezumiYuki,RON!
13-02-2020T22:25:05,NezumiYuki,Howdy!
13-02-2020T22:25:07,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Ron \o/
13-02-2020T22:25:14,BeeMill,I guess my point is just that I don;t think firearms would fit in TK
13-02-2020T22:25:42,SageSaga,Yosh has firearms and magic :P
13-02-2020T22:25:49,ZRO4825,And Toyoko.
13-02-2020T22:25:49,Roughlandin,"They might. Again, my point was if magic is that destructive and that common, it might make them redundant"
13-02-2020T22:25:52,ZRO4825,\'.'/
13-02-2020T22:25:54,KeefMcDerpface,"In short, traditional firearms need gunpowder, and it's not stated if gunpowder is a thing in TK."
13-02-2020T22:26:12,MetalAppleSauce,"idk, precision destruction would be useful for someone like Red"
13-02-2020T22:26:28,Nekonny,F5 for more streams ^^
13-02-2020T22:26:39,Mediawatcher,Someone should suggest a sketch of a twokinds character using firearms
13-02-2020T22:26:41,Roughlandin,INB4 the Seige on the Manor starts and Trace remembers he has a secret arsenal hidden in the basement
13-02-2020T22:26:41,CrRAR,"magic for mystiq, guns for intensity,"
13-02-2020T22:27:11,BeeMill,Yall heard of Rivals of Aether?

13-02-2020T22:27:53,BeeMill,Delectable
13-02-2020T22:27:59,KeefMcDerpface,"Magic in one hand, gun in the other."
13-02-2020T22:28:10,KeefMcDerpface,Just like Bioshock 2.
13-02-2020T22:28:29,Roughlandin,Does bioshock count as magic?
13-02-2020T22:28:34,NezumiYuki,"The Amazon's Mana Arrows are basically magic, in Diablo2, so yeah... bows, crossbows, guns, magic... it could work in TKs"
13-02-2020T22:28:54,Mediawatcher,I think guns would work perfectly in twokinds
13-02-2020T22:29:18,Mediawatcher,Depends on what kinds of firearms
13-02-2020T22:29:26,BeeMill,"I wouldn't be opposed if it was magic based, but not just straight up actual guns unless they were very primative"

13-02-2020T22:31:18,KeefMcDerpface,"Okay, so a single shot weapon would work in TK."
13-02-2020T22:31:20,MetalAppleSauce,I drew Mike and Evals playing badminton while flying planes and this is what Tom's doing in return
13-02-2020T22:31:22,NezumiYuki,LAWL... Lady Nora would just whip out her own personal GAU8 or the whole Warthog and blaze away!  xD
13-02-2020T22:31:40,KeefMcDerpface,BRRRRRRT

13-02-2020T22:34:19,starcat13,we have Raine with tank!
13-02-2020T22:34:31,Roughlandin,I thought Raine was plane

13-02-2020T22:35:53,BeeMill,Dragon obviously
13-02-2020T22:35:54,Roughlandin,Dragon every time
13-02-2020T22:36:09,Roughlandin,Like I said. Dragons = nukes

13-02-2020T22:36:56,Roughlandin,That's a question. Could Nora survive a nuclear blast?
13-02-2020T22:37:09,Mediawatcher,I‚Äôd say most likely
13-02-2020T22:37:21,BeeMill,I'm guessing not
13-02-2020T22:37:25,KeefMcDerpface,A fleet of fighters with nukes v. one Dragon.
13-02-2020T22:37:35,Roughlandin,I think so too. It's already established she's functionally immortal
13-02-2020T22:37:35,MetalAppleSauce,"...Dragon, still"
13-02-2020T22:37:51,BeeMill,This sketch looks so good

13-02-2020T22:38:37,BeeMill,Are these sketches going to be included for the color voting I wonder?
13-02-2020T22:38:38,CrRAR,hows you?
13-02-2020T22:38:46,Roughlandin,Prolly not
13-02-2020T22:38:47,RimaDraws,ugh somewhat ok
13-02-2020T22:38:47,MetalAppleSauce,"Yeah, if Nora Cards were still buyable I would have bought one at some point in the distant future when I was financially stable"
13-02-2020T22:39:03,Mediawatcher,Why were the Nora cards removed?
13-02-2020T22:39:07,MetalAppleSauce,Sanity
13-02-2020T22:39:11,Roughlandin,They're a lot of work
13-02-2020T22:39:13,NezumiYuki,"Welp considering Tom already drew Natani on a Tiger-1... I guess that means to up the ante, Flora should go on a KingTiger.  xDD"
13-02-2020T22:39:15,Roughlandin,Tom is only a man
13-02-2020T22:39:16,BeeMill,"Wait, did he remove them?"
13-02-2020T22:39:17,Gm35,Too much time being spent on them
