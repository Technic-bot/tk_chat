12-03-2020T00:01:12,SonOfGoku,That’s good
12-03-2020T00:10:43,SpazztasticKiwi,night Tom
12-03-2020T02:18:08,Dadrobit,Tried talking to upper management and the HOA rep today in a meeting about officer precautions with the virus.
12-03-2020T02:19:12,Dadrobit,"Stuff like, less handshakes and face to face times. No more accepting random packages. More wipes and soaps..."
12-03-2020T02:20:29,Dadrobit,"""Hmmm, no, we really can't cut corners on our services, sorry. We need to provide the absolute best client services at all time, rain, shine, or virus. Just tell your guys to wash their hands more."""
12-03-2020T02:21:07,Dadrobit,"Also, classes are cancelled for another week while professors turn their classes into online classes."
12-03-2020T02:21:47,SonOfGoku,Same thing happened here for my school
12-03-2020T02:23:12,SonOfGoku,We just started a new trimester and couldn’t finish the first week
12-03-2020T02:24:51,Dadrobit,100% some courses are gonna suffer in a bad way. Especially the tech ones.
12-03-2020T02:25:19,SonOfGoku,Unfortunately my school is an engineering school
12-03-2020T02:25:50,SonOfGoku,Everything is tech based for us
12-03-2020T02:26:35,Dadrobit,"English, maths, sciences, they'll be fine. But my CCL tech courses, I can't think of any of them even being remotely feasible because the classes revolved around our hardware and software only available on campus"
12-03-2020T02:27:49,Dadrobit,"We have a lot of tech courses at our campus, absolutely fantastic school, and it's just... Gone for those students."
12-03-2020T02:29:44,Dadrobit,"(I finished my CCL last year, so I'm good personally, but still...)"
12-03-2020T02:33:48,SonOfGoku,I still need the rest of this year and another year to get my bachelors degree

12-03-2020T10:48:25,JojoF2415,13 days
12-03-2020T10:51:11,JojoF2415,I’m joking
12-03-2020T10:51:45,JojoF2415,I’ve been doing my own stuff lately now that the grading period is over
12-03-2020T10:53:55,AspiringNoodle,I can't help but feel like what I've been experiencing is mismanagement
12-03-2020T10:54:11,AspiringNoodle,Nothing like being told you need to be recertified for everything in one week or you can't work anymore
12-03-2020T10:54:23,AspiringNoodle,Doesn't matter if you were already certified... within the past few months...
12-03-2020T10:54:53,AspiringNoodle,And I'm not sure if that's the manager's fault or corporate's fault.  Because the certification mandate is from the top
12-03-2020T10:56:17,AspiringNoodle,"Also, willing to share what you've been working on?"
12-03-2020T10:56:23,AspiringNoodle,Is it Kat stuff?!? :ptv-excited:

12-03-2020T11:21:45,AspiringNoodle,Audio training is the cringiest thing possible...
12-03-2020T11:29:32,JojoF2415,Right now I’m watching a movie with the class. Everyone has to sit 3 chairs apart due to the coronavirus
12-03-2020T12:48:32,AspiringNoodle,"Time for work. Or not.  I thought training was just alcohol / tobacco and I was told 3 hours, and I was also told 6 hours"
12-03-2020T12:48:43,AspiringNoodle,I'm at about 2.5 hours

12-03-2020T20:37:56,Mediawatcher,Adira comes later right now he has to save everyone in the manor
12-03-2020T20:38:10,Mediawatcher,Who else can you think of to save her?
12-03-2020T20:38:17,ShamusTheFox,Mrs. Nibbly saves Adira
12-03-2020T20:38:19,CrimsonHelsing,"And not really. Wouldn't want that black mana spreading too quickly, if you mean him using black mana. OP normal Mana tho, I'm all for, and I can't wait to see that"

12-03-2020T20:39:42,CrRAR,^ but that too
12-03-2020T20:39:45,ShamusTheFox,Perfectly ordinary squirrel. Ordinary. Or-din-ary.
12-03-2020T20:40:12,Mediawatcher,Yes the squirrel who wishes death upon maren and survived getting thrown into a tree is perfectly ordinary!
12-03-2020T20:40:22,CrimsonHelsing,lol
12-03-2020T20:40:24,Lunarsprint,Suuup

12-03-2020T20:41:10,Lunarsprint,@ Johnny that's not allowed is it?
12-03-2020T20:41:15,BadFoMo,What if Nibbly is Maeve's father?
12-03-2020T20:41:19,johnnytho,anything goes dude
12-03-2020T20:41:29,henner,i bet nibbly is a dragon secretly
12-03-2020T20:41:37,henner,was hinted at in the comic
12-03-2020T20:41:40,ShamusTheFox,GASP! Such a juicy secret!
12-03-2020T20:41:48,ZRO4825,Personally I think she's a [REDACTED]
12-03-2020T20:41:48,Mediawatcher,Probably a dark spirit that fell in love with a wolf
12-03-2020T20:41:50,johnnytho,headcannon for now
12-03-2020T20:42:06,Mediawatcher,And took a squirrel form
12-03-2020T20:42:19,henner,nibbly as a character is basically equal to what reds real name is
12-03-2020T20:42:30,Mediawatcher,I bet his name is reed
12-03-2020T20:42:36,CrRAR,lol
12-03-2020T20:42:41,Mediawatcher,Like the plant
12-03-2020T20:42:46,johnnytho,Ha I feel thats something Tom would do
12-03-2020T20:42:50,CrRAR,"Like the Alice, too"
12-03-2020T20:42:54,henner,his name has something to do with some kind of plant i know that....
12-03-2020T20:42:56,BadFoMo,"I have another idea about what/who Nibbly is, but I don't want to give any ideas."
12-03-2020T20:42:57,ShamusTheFox,Nibbly is Clovis in disguise. That's why the squirrel remains female because of Nora's curse.
12-03-2020T20:43:11,henner,lol
12-03-2020T20:43:26,johnnytho,cant be...
12-03-2020T20:43:30,Mediawatcher,Maybe she’s one of the possessed animals of brahns  daughter
12-03-2020T20:43:34,CrRAR,everything Clovis is girl?
12-03-2020T20:44:05,CrimsonHelsing,"someone once theorized his name could actually be, get this... Rhubarb"
12-03-2020T20:44:10,MviluUatusun,Good evening everybody.  I can't really stay too long.  Need to get some sleep for a change.

12-03-2020T20:44:38,Mediawatcher,A part of me kind of wants for reds name to never be revealed! 🤣

12-03-2020T20:45:18,BadFoMo,@CrimsonHelsing Who/what is that?
12-03-2020T20:45:25,MviluUatusun,"Not too bad, FoMo.  Still have lower back problems when I try to sleep."
12-03-2020T20:45:30,henner,im pretty sure reds real name bieng hidden is supposed to be a joke
12-03-2020T20:45:42,ZRO4825,In before it's actually just Red.
12-03-2020T20:45:48,ShamusTheFox,"So, I had a scenario in my head that I think could possibly happen in the story. Clovis discovers Maeve and possesses her with magic to try and get revenge on Zen and Natani, knowing that they would (probably, in all probability) harm a little girl."
12-03-2020T20:45:49,henner,like a running ga
12-03-2020T20:45:50,ZRO4825,And his parents were just jerks with naming their kids.
12-03-2020T20:45:52,Mediawatcher,"Yeah I know, we’ll probably never know his name"
12-03-2020T20:45:53,henner,gag*
12-03-2020T20:46:07,KeefMcDerpface,"Nah, its actually is just [DATA BASS ERROR]."

12-03-2020T22:18:02,CrimsonHelsing,one of the most reasonable
12-03-2020T22:18:20,drmelfice,"Imo, Rose just wants to bring Saria back using Maren's body :P"
12-03-2020T22:18:45,CrimsonHelsing,"someone did, and Trace somehow kept them there in that room. whoever they are"
12-03-2020T22:19:00,CrimsonHelsing,don't think it's Rose tho
12-03-2020T22:19:05,ShamusTheFox,"I don't think it's Rose. She saw what Maren looked like when she arrived, and didn't seem to have any great aspirations about the resemblance. But if it means getting Saria back, she might not fight the results."
12-03-2020T22:19:11,steelabjur,"I think a part of her wants Saria back, no matter the cost, as did Trace."
12-03-2020T22:19:28,drmelfice,"well Shamus, she could just be putting up a facade"
12-03-2020T22:19:52,Ordithus,This whole time no one asked Saria if she wants to come back
12-03-2020T22:19:54,drmelfice,"There must be a reason why Trace's dark side freaked out when she was ""unchained"""
12-03-2020T22:19:54,SwiftKitten,poor rose :'(
12-03-2020T22:20:01,CrRAR,"I think she would recognize that bringing her ""back"" is probably not very respectful"
12-03-2020T22:20:06,ShamusTheFox,"True, but there was no guarantee Maren would activate the table that set everything into motion."
12-03-2020T22:20:10,CrimsonHelsing,"She may be mischievous, but... I don't see her being that mean to the new Trace like that"
12-03-2020T22:20:50,CrimsonHelsing,and what Shamus said
12-03-2020T22:21:25,BadFoMo,Back.
12-03-2020T22:21:38,steelabjur,wb
12-03-2020T22:22:03,CrimsonHelsing,"Rose is definitely aware of whatever, or whoever are hiding on the third floor (somehow still alive with nothing to sustain them as far as we know), my guess she never thought it'd be crucial to tell Trace or anyone about it. obviously she never expected"
12-03-2020T22:22:13,CrimsonHelsing,them to become active as soon as Maren activated the table

12-03-2020T22:23:19,CrRAR,"""I Am Jack's Smirking Revenge"""
12-03-2020T22:23:37,steelabjur,"Multiple personalities, perhaps."
12-03-2020T22:24:03,Ordithus,She wasn't entirely aware of the... thing.  Knew of it but not where it was http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/1058/
12-03-2020T22:24:22,CrRAR,"yeah, plus her disgust at ""that thing"""
12-03-2020T22:24:22,ShamusTheFox,"Steel, that is a legitimate possibility I had not considered."
12-03-2020T22:24:58,CrimsonHelsing,"we know Trace left in a big hurry for Pinewood in the spring, but if he was there for Maren, we have yet to find out why he suddenly had a change of plans, and went charging off into the nearby forest after Sythe and Flora's caravan (possibly). Or for"
12-03-2020T22:25:08,CrimsonHelsing,"that matter, how he caught wind of it if that's what he was after"
12-03-2020T22:25:44,steelabjur,Neutral meddling could explain that.
12-03-2020T22:25:49,CrimsonHelsing,"everything after that tho, is history"
12-03-2020T22:26:05,BadFoMo,He was after Sythe and Flora's caravan?
12-03-2020T22:26:11,CrRAR,How good of Rose to leave the right amount of dust for such pretty moonbeams.
12-03-2020T22:26:15,CrimsonHelsing,that's what my theory is anyway
12-03-2020T22:26:39,CrRAR,She thinks of EVERYTHING
12-03-2020T22:26:44,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-rose:
12-03-2020T22:27:05,CrimsonHelsing,"why tho, is anyone's guess. assassination perhaps, preventing the alliance from happening (though that fell through anyway), who knows"
12-03-2020T22:27:47,CrimsonHelsing,"they were passing through miles and miles of human territory tho, so it's a wonder they weren't intercepted by jumpy Imperials"
12-03-2020T22:28:00,KeefMcDerpface,It was a keidran caravan passing through human lands so...
12-03-2020T22:28:04,CrimsonHelsing,"and by Imperials, I mean the humans of the human empire"
12-03-2020T22:28:28,CrimsonHelsing,not of the Order
12-03-2020T22:28:42,KeefMcDerpface,Don't forget the mercenaries and towns people.
12-03-2020T22:28:57,CrimsonHelsing,exactly. it's a miracle they weren't intercepted sooner
12-03-2020T22:29:11,CrRAR,nice authoritative Nyna
12-03-2020T22:29:23,CrimsonHelsing,"how they managed to get that far into the human empire, idk"
12-03-2020T22:29:55,KeefMcDerpface,Must've taken the back roads?
12-03-2020T22:30:04,KeefMcDerpface,The roads less traveled?
12-03-2020T22:30:09,CrRAR,country roooad~
12-03-2020T22:30:17,steelabjur,Kinda wonder why they were that far into Human territory.
12-03-2020T22:30:55,CrimsonHelsing,"guess with all the chaos the Order was causing, imperials weren't very keen on keeping their territory all that secure. or maybe they're already stretched too thin by the start of all this, got greedy on territory like the NCR"
12-03-2020T22:30:57,SageSaga,are y'all talking about the wolves that attacked?
12-03-2020T22:31:04,CrRAR,they are
12-03-2020T22:31:17,KeefMcDerpface,The keidran's version of the underground railroad?
12-03-2020T22:31:20,Ordithus,"The really early stuff right now, the events leading up to the first pages"
12-03-2020T22:31:22,BadFoMo,Half way between Wolf and Tiger turf?
12-03-2020T22:31:26,SageSaga,they do know they were able to disguise themselves as humans - right?
12-03-2020T22:31:32,steelabjur,"It's been awhile since I looked at the Mekkan map, but Wolf and Tiger territories share a border, yeah?"
12-03-2020T22:31:36,Ordithus,no
12-03-2020T22:31:42,Ordithus,complete opposite sides of the continet
12-03-2020T22:31:47,Ordithus,er continent
12-03-2020T22:31:50,KeefMcDerpface,They's half way around the world.
12-03-2020T22:31:54,CrimsonHelsing,I wouldn't be surprised if the human empire got greedy in expanding their borders in recent years prior
12-03-2020T22:32:10,CrRAR,"towers, towers everywhere"
12-03-2020T22:32:15,CrimsonHelsing,and they don't have enough patrols and soldiers to secure their own territory
12-03-2020T22:32:55,CrimsonHelsing,probably would explain why the wolves' raids along the western coast went nearly unchecked at the start of this war
12-03-2020T22:32:57,Ordithus,"As for the recent epilogue page, I trust no one!"
12-03-2020T22:33:03,CrRAR,right?
12-03-2020T22:33:10,KeefMcDerpface,"Also, how did the wolves that attacked Eddmire (is that how you spell it?) get there in the first place?"
12-03-2020T22:33:18,CrimsonHelsing,the riftwall
12-03-2020T22:33:29,Twokinds,Wolf prisoners were kept in Edinmire because it was as far from the war as possible.
12-03-2020T22:33:35,Twokinds,That's why it was a surprise wolves attacked.
12-03-2020T22:33:45,CrRAR,ah
12-03-2020T22:33:52,KeefMcDerpface,Not the prisoners.
12-03-2020T22:34:00,KeefMcDerpface,The wolves that did the attack.
12-03-2020T22:34:13,CrimsonHelsing,"there's a riftwall location in occupied territory in the West, and it has a gateway to Adira's Riftwall tavern that isn't sealed."
12-03-2020T22:34:31,CrimsonHelsing,or guarded
12-03-2020T22:34:38,steelabjur,@KeefMcDerpface the Riftwall tavern that Adira runs has a portal to another tavern with a portal near wolf territory.
12-03-2020T22:34:59,CrimsonHelsing,obvious that Clovis managed to comandeer it in all the chaos
12-03-2020T22:35:04,CrRAR,they gonna pour out all rowdy like it was Last Call. xD
12-03-2020T22:35:13,KeefMcDerpface,"I know about the portal, just surprised they got to where they needed to go without being detected."
12-03-2020T22:35:14,CrimsonHelsing,lol
12-03-2020T22:35:33,CrimsonHelsing,blame that on the dumb guards that didn't think to guard that door
12-03-2020T22:35:42,CrimsonHelsing,or seal it off

12-03-2020T22:55:03,Mediawatcher,Mostly
12-03-2020T22:55:13,CrRAR,there's a point where you just want to appreciate the progression of the older art style

12-03-2020T22:56:00,Mediawatcher,"While I’d love to see the old pages on the modern artstyle, it would take way too much and honestly I love seeing who toms art has progressed throughout the years."
12-03-2020T22:56:05,Twokinds,By July
12-03-2020T22:56:06,BadFoMo,I thought it was just Maeve.

12-03-2020T22:57:17,steelabjur,"I'd be surprised if this is still a problem by July (then again, with the way they're handling things...)"
12-03-2020T22:57:24,CrRAR,"less clean up required, still lots to do though"
12-03-2020T22:57:24,CrimsonHelsing,"it's going to be an honor to meet you face to face at AC, Tom"
