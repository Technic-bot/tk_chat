17-07-2020T16:10:48,aeoronwah,I don't know much about spellcasters
17-07-2020T16:12:12,SageSaga,if wizards were real- and one pointed a wand at you- would you be concerned like someone pointing a gun at you?
17-07-2020T16:19:14,Ordithus,probably more.  guns are pretty straight forward.  a wizard has many more options
17-07-2020T16:19:52,SageSaga,yeah- they could just make your dick fall off- that's pretty scary stuff

17-07-2020T16:24:53,SpazztasticKiwi,that’s the max deal discount

17-07-2020T16:25:15,SageSaga,did ya mean 2.85?
17-07-2020T16:25:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"wait wait no, it’s 30 bombs for $285"
17-07-2020T16:25:48,SageSaga,thats still a horrible price

17-07-2020T16:25:59,SageSaga,yes- horrible
17-07-2020T16:26:03,SpazztasticKiwi,they have goodies inside them
17-07-2020T16:26:24,SageSaga,like gold nuggets?
17-07-2020T16:26:34,SpazztasticKiwi,& each has a code towards winning  $10000
17-07-2020T16:26:49,SpazztasticKiwi,or at least a ring worth that much

17-07-2020T16:28:25,SageSaga,not on the irrational fear of body mutilation from Wizards?

17-07-2020T16:41:59,Ordithus,wizards have a habit of trying to find fun things like those
