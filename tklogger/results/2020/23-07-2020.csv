23-07-2020T00:08:20,AspiringNoodle,"Nothing against Mark, but the whole channel is going to last a single year, right?"
23-07-2020T00:09:01,AspiringNoodle,"Or is it just content for a year, and then they leave everything up?"
23-07-2020T00:10:03,SpazztasticKiwi,they’re deleting it on the anniversary
23-07-2020T00:10:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Mark says it’s for the fact that nothing is for forever & you should use your time wisely
23-07-2020T00:11:09,SpazztasticKiwi,& that him and Ethan wanted to do something together
23-07-2020T00:15:08,AspiringNoodle,"Okay, I thought that's what you told me however long ago"
23-07-2020T00:16:22,AspiringNoodle,Definitely an original concept

23-07-2020T01:56:05,SpazztasticKiwi,you can substitute banana for eggs in some things
23-07-2020T02:06:57,AspiringNoodle,"What I mean is, you don't even need eggs at all, lol"
23-07-2020T02:07:20,AspiringNoodle,"Apparently the ingredients in Betty Crocker cake mix, for example, already fill the same roles that eggs do"
23-07-2020T02:08:00,AspiringNoodle,And it all goes back to the 1950's and a survey

23-07-2020T21:18:17,IronHorseComics,wait a minute... is Rose possessing Maren's body? the way she's stepping looks very... Keidran...
23-07-2020T21:18:18,Ordithus,feather fall is less destructive
23-07-2020T21:18:28,Ordithus,"examine the shading, iron"
23-07-2020T21:18:30,CrRAR,we think that's Karens foot doe
23-07-2020T21:18:32,CrimsonHelsing,I don't think so Iron
23-07-2020T21:18:32,Roughlandin,I will. Maddie tried and it gave her a nose bleed
23-07-2020T21:18:34,AspiringNoodle,"Sage, that spell seems extremely useful for the busty ladies :P"
23-07-2020T21:18:42,SageSaga,gives them a different perspective- and if that doesnt work- they take fall damage
23-07-2020T21:18:47,CrimsonHelsing,more like trying to stop mid-step
23-07-2020T21:18:54,CrimsonHelsing,she noticed something
23-07-2020T21:19:06,SageSaga,also Reverse gravity is not good for busty ladies
23-07-2020T21:19:15,AspiringNoodle,Oh no
23-07-2020T21:19:15,SageSaga,it reverses it- it doesnt negate it

23-07-2020T22:52:24,Ordithus,*boop*
23-07-2020T22:52:40,Roughlandin,Yeah the TK game feels like the only reason it's not getting sued is because Tom can't be bothered
23-07-2020T22:53:43,unsteddyphoenix,I mean whatever let the dude have his project
23-07-2020T22:53:47,unsteddyphoenix,Dont see the harm
23-07-2020T22:54:14,Roughlandin,Oh I agree. Just saying it's technically IP theft
23-07-2020T22:54:26,ZRO4825,Technically Tom has TK under a license that makes it so you can do whatever so long as you're not profiting off HIS work.
23-07-2020T22:54:36,ZRO4825,"AKA, selling the game for money."
23-07-2020T22:54:47,SageSaga,the harm would be- what if Tom wanted to license an actual game? hed have to name it something else- and probably have to sue them
23-07-2020T22:54:48,ZRO4825,"So, long as that's not happening, no infringement is happening."
23-07-2020T22:55:06,ZRO4825,"But yup, there is also what Sage is saying to consider."
23-07-2020T22:56:00,MuonNeutrino,"the license tom uses includes a share-alike provision, so any game has to admit it itself has no claim"
23-07-2020T22:56:26,unsteddyphoenix,I dont see a twokinds fan dedicated enough to make a twokinds fangame not rolling over for Tom himself
23-07-2020T22:56:39,SageSaga,yeah but do you know how hard it is to trademark something if a bunch of people are using a fair use license with it?
23-07-2020T22:56:42,ContagiousBordem16,Maybe the could make it like the way RadicalSoda did with the With The Addition Of Markiplier Games
23-07-2020T22:56:47,Roughlandin,"Yeah, Teddy... but this is the internet we're talking about"
23-07-2020T22:56:48,ContagiousBordem16,They*
23-07-2020T22:57:17,Werewing,Apparently a TK game exists...though it looks shoddy AF.
23-07-2020T22:57:17,unsteddyphoenix,I guess coding an mmo alone for 10~ years might've driven him crazy
23-07-2020T22:57:24,SageSaga,there's a reason a lot of people dont use the fair use licenses - its a legal pain if something does change
23-07-2020T22:57:57,Roughlandin,"Exactly. When you trademark an IP, you have to prove you're protecting that IP. If you don't, you could be denied the trademark"
23-07-2020T22:59:41,SageSaga,"also imagine this- Tom gets a deal for Twokinds Animation - then the company is like ""hey so- the SEO for the advertising campaign is being trashed because of this game with your IPs name on it"""

23-07-2020T23:02:01,ContagiousBordem16,CookieDragons in trouble!...............
23-07-2020T23:02:29,unsteddyphoenix,That wont be an issue
23-07-2020T23:02:36,Roughlandin,@untsteddyphoenix Search Engine Optimization optimised?
23-07-2020T23:02:43,ZRO4825,Still a valid point though.
23-07-2020T23:02:53,unsteddyphoenix,Yes exactly
23-07-2020T23:02:53,SageSaga,then how come it comes up in a bunch of my searches and even one of the original searches i get says Twokinds is a game based on a webcomic?
23-07-2020T23:03:18,unsteddyphoenix,"Ive never once seen it on my searches, thats probably personalised to you"
23-07-2020T23:03:27,ContagiousBordem16,It’s downloadable on CookieDragons discord server
23-07-2020T23:03:41,SageSaga,no- i tried it on a clean install on a device id never used without any login info
23-07-2020T23:03:54,SageSaga,it was as clean as it gets
23-07-2020T23:04:01,Combak,What did you search?
23-07-2020T23:04:05,SageSaga,Twokinds
23-07-2020T23:04:09,unsteddyphoenix,"That seems pretty hard to believe but, even so"
23-07-2020T23:04:12,Combak,And how far down did you go?
23-07-2020T23:04:21,SageSaga,it was on the first page
23-07-2020T23:04:29,unsteddyphoenix,A company pays for SEO to avoid that exact situation
23-07-2020T23:04:50,Werewing,For me it is on the Second Google Page. But I am not clean.
23-07-2020T23:04:58,Ordithus,"hm not on the first page of a google search, clean"
23-07-2020T23:05:08,Roughlandin,"My google search doesn't show it, but I'm as unclean as a TK stan gets"
23-07-2020T23:05:10,SageSaga,an advertising company optimizes SEO for that- but they would still be pissed off if a bunch of their meta tags were taken up by some unofficial thing
23-07-2020T23:05:22,Combak,"Oh, it's the third hit in a Google search."
23-07-2020T23:05:27,Ordithus,shows up on the first page on bing
23-07-2020T23:05:50,Roughlandin,"Eh. Unless the dev digs their heels in, I doubt Tom would have much trouble getting things resolved if he DID need to"
23-07-2020T23:05:50,SageSaga,it was on Safari when i saw it
23-07-2020T23:06:06,ZRO4825,"It doesn't show up at all on mine, but my personalization is most likely getting in the way, lol"
23-07-2020T23:06:07,Roughlandin,He'd probably just have to have someone draft him a Cease and Desist
23-07-2020T23:06:09,SageSaga,it doesnt matter- its a pain in the butt and causes legit legal issues
23-07-2020T23:06:12,unsteddyphoenix,"Huh...no game, but on the 3rd page of google I see the comic is uploaded to webtoons"
23-07-2020T23:06:17,unsteddyphoenix,Dont think thats right
23-07-2020T23:06:20,Roughlandin,Wat?
23-07-2020T23:06:25,Roughlandin,Wait... That's illegal
23-07-2020T23:07:58,unsteddyphoenix,I doubt it could ever be anything but the most minor inconvenience in the rare situation that Tom ever gets a game deal.
23-07-2020T23:08:10,Roughlandin,...This discussion is starting to make me realize why Disney has an entire army of copyright lawyers on retainer at all times
23-07-2020T23:08:16,SageSaga,ok yeah that Webtoons thing should be taken down
23-07-2020T23:08:30,unsteddyphoenix,"So, i'll allow a 1/10000 chance for issues for the dude to keep his project. I'll allow it as the lead Twokinds fan."
23-07-2020T23:08:34,w0lfmare,"I feel like if Tom made a game, it wouldn't be Twokinds anyways"
23-07-2020T23:08:46,Ordithus,illusion Maren hurts everyone she loves </3
23-07-2020T23:08:51,Roughlandin,Here is my comic. Towkinds by Tumbus Fishback?
23-07-2020T23:08:56,AspiringNoodle,"A legit Twokinds game would belong in the ecchi genre, haha"
23-07-2020T23:09:01,Combak,XD
23-07-2020T23:09:06,AspiringNoodle,"Heavily censored, of course :snail:"
23-07-2020T23:09:22,KeefMcDerpface,:ptv-shock: No ankle wrappings?!
23-07-2020T23:09:25,Sclimshady,"Dont lie w0lf,  you want a TK dating sim"
23-07-2020T23:09:28,unsteddyphoenix,Gimme my twokinds dating sim this instant
23-07-2020T23:09:34,Roughlandin,@Ordithus Regular Maren ALSO hurts many people she loves
23-07-2020T23:09:38,w0lfmare,wat
23-07-2020T23:09:48,w0lfmare,Why would I want that
23-07-2020T23:09:58,Roughlandin,As long as I can date Mike. The true ending.
23-07-2020T23:10:03,Combak,lol
23-07-2020T23:10:08,KeefMcDerpface,To tell everyone to put on pants?
23-07-2020T23:10:16,AspiringNoodle,"But yeah, while it sucks for fan projects when a company comes down HARD on them"
23-07-2020T23:10:30,Werewing,If it is a dating sim most will start off wearing pants.
23-07-2020T23:10:32,AspiringNoodle,It's also because they're protecting their property and their ability to do future projects
23-07-2020T23:10:41,HeresyArtStream,Hey yall :cheresyartstream-harrywave01:
23-07-2020T23:10:44,AspiringNoodle,Hey heresy

23-07-2020T23:11:40,Combak,"Oh, hi Heresy."
23-07-2020T23:11:40,Roughlandin,Tom was using it to censor Reni's naked butt
23-07-2020T23:11:48,KeefMcDerpface,:ptv-shock:

23-07-2020T23:12:23,w0lfmare,Is this the scene where Karen's character gets killed off?
23-07-2020T23:12:33,KeefMcDerpface,We don't know.
23-07-2020T23:12:35,KeefMcDerpface,Maybe?
23-07-2020T23:12:40,Roughlandin,"There has been much discussion on this, wOlf"
23-07-2020T23:12:52,Ordithus,Hoping the boys do a rescue
23-07-2020T23:13:05,Roughlandin,Super Spy Maddie saves the day
23-07-2020T23:13:15,AspiringNoodle,The people are going to do a thing and Karen lives
23-07-2020T23:13:21,AspiringNoodle,The end

23-07-2020T23:17:31,Roughlandin,Well... I have a big butt. That's LIKE a nice butt
23-07-2020T23:17:49,Werewing,Butts have been on the rise.
23-07-2020T23:17:54,Combak,"Should we start singing ""Baby Got Back""?"
23-07-2020T23:17:55,PopularDollars,butt quality is a function of butt size
23-07-2020T23:18:02,Rooth,*peeks in*  Hello!
23-07-2020T23:18:05,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-FloDance:

23-07-2020T23:18:18,Werewing,"Hello Rooth, do you want to engage with butts."
23-07-2020T23:18:45,ZRO4825,Butt size is most definitely not a function of quality assitude.
23-07-2020T23:18:58,ZRO4825,Some of the best butts are most certainly not the big ones.
23-07-2020T23:19:14,Dadrobit,Howdy y'all! How're you all incredible people doing tonight?
23-07-2020T23:19:19,KeefMcDerpface,Hello Dad

23-07-2020T23:19:30,Combak,Hi Robit!
23-07-2020T23:19:33,johnnytho,im working on it
23-07-2020T23:19:33,Roughlandin,The function is Butt Speed x Butt size/ Cheek Spread = Butt Quality
23-07-2020T23:19:45,KeefMcDerpface,:ptv-confused:
23-07-2020T23:19:46,Ordithus,wat
23-07-2020T23:19:46,ZRO4825,"A formula would be useless. It would have to change wildly, varying from purveyor to purveyor."
23-07-2020T23:19:50,Werewing,"Man, this butt discussion has really gotten everyone typing."
23-07-2020T23:19:52,Majyxs,Someone call Billy Gunn.
23-07-2020T23:19:57,KeefMcDerpface,"Can you repeat that, teacher?"
23-07-2020T23:20:01,unsteddyphoenix,"Its not the butt on the outside that matters, it's the butt in the persons heart"
23-07-2020T23:20:07,Roughlandin,I don't know. I stopped caring about math after algebra...
23-07-2020T23:20:14,PopularDollars,"you gotta factor in wrinkle count such that it's inverse to quality, for nobody likes a wrinkle butt."
23-07-2020T23:20:17,Combak,Let's be honest. The whole thing is a surve.
23-07-2020T23:20:33,CrRAR,"What about heartbutt then, teddy?"
23-07-2020T23:20:34,Combak,"... Ironically, it'd probably make a butt is graphed and mirrored."
23-07-2020T23:20:43,Combak,*if graphed
23-07-2020T23:20:45,Roughlandin,Guys. Can we just agree that the real buttchat was the friends we made along the way.
23-07-2020T23:20:50,johnnytho,yes
23-07-2020T23:20:56,unsteddyphoenix,"That is, ofcourse, a symbol of a good person"
23-07-2020T23:20:57,KeefMcDerpface,yep
23-07-2020T23:21:12,CrRAR,"Ahh, :ok_hand:"
23-07-2020T23:21:15,KeefMcDerpface,And then there's the Butt Bag...
23-07-2020T23:21:17,Dadrobit,"The butt of the heart is located near, but in a distinctly different location from the cockles."
23-07-2020T23:21:30,Combak,The what?
23-07-2020T23:21:49,Dadrobit,"The cockles of the heart, part of the ventricles"
23-07-2020T23:21:57,KeefMcDerpface,Ah.
23-07-2020T23:22:00,Combak,... All I'm getting for that is a shellfish.
23-07-2020T23:22:03,Roughlandin,"IP law. Butt equations. We solving the REAL real problems tonight, kids."
23-07-2020T23:22:07,CrRAR,"Cockles, also adjacent to the heartstrings"
23-07-2020T23:22:33,Majyxs,"Fatbottomed girls, they make the rockin' world go 'round."
23-07-2020T23:22:36,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Dad, did you just say your heart has a butt?"
23-07-2020T23:22:45,KeefMcDerpface,:ptv-confused:
23-07-2020T23:22:48,Ordithus,everything has a butt
23-07-2020T23:22:49,Roughlandin,My heart is about 95% butt
23-07-2020T23:22:51,Ordithus,even lemons
23-07-2020T23:22:57,Ordithus,what a world
23-07-2020T23:22:57,Werewing,Do you really want to ask your dad that?
23-07-2020T23:22:59,KeefMcDerpface,Well... Lemons that are purple do so...
23-07-2020T23:23:00,Dadrobit,"It's tremendous, Marv. The best"
