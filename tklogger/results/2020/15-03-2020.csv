15-03-2020T00:32:25,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs the dogs at home and their barking and work and smother of the year

15-03-2020T00:49:27,SpazztasticKiwi,I was thinking more along the lines of stumbling upon Nora with a Trace body pillow

15-03-2020T08:01:15,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-nibrun::ctwokinds-keith8D::ctwokinds-nibrun:
15-03-2020T08:08:26,AspiringNoodle,Hey Terra xD
15-03-2020T08:08:43,AspiringNoodle,"I tell ya, it sucks being a Blizzard fan boi"
15-03-2020T08:09:40,TerraTheWizard,they do something stupid again?
15-03-2020T08:29:57,AspiringNoodle,"All of BFA, pretty much"
15-03-2020T08:30:44,AspiringNoodle,"In general, Blizzard is WAAAAAAAAAAAAAY too slow when it comes to any kind of major changes.  Meaning something in the game may be stupidly over(or under)powered for months"
15-03-2020T08:31:21,AspiringNoodle,Or they overreact and something goes from being viable if slightly overpowered to nonviable
15-03-2020T08:32:46,AspiringNoodle,"Basically, I think they tune their game from a statistics / data analysis standpoint, so they implement something, let data build, analyze it, then implement changes.  But they only implement those changes when new stuff is about to be added"
15-03-2020T08:33:11,AspiringNoodle,"So unpredictable results can occur.  Essentially, they do a shitty job of being game *designers* :P"
15-03-2020T08:33:23,AspiringNoodle,"Also, sorry for WoT xD"
15-03-2020T08:40:23,K3IDRAN,"My job, is a Youtuber and I get shit, Views"
15-03-2020T08:42:12,Xexanoth,"That's a problem with most online games though. Something is strong, then instead of just nerfing 1 thing to see if that helps that nerf 5 different things and it becomes complete shit"
15-03-2020T08:43:12,Xexanoth,or you do the World of Warships things and when there's a russian ship with OP armor you nerf it's already useless Anti Air so you can claim you nerfed it :ptv-confused:
15-03-2020T08:51:31,AspiringNoodle,Currently I'm playing an enhancement shaman
15-03-2020T08:51:43,AspiringNoodle,"But in 8.1, they utterly destroyed the class' pvp potential"
15-03-2020T08:52:20,AspiringNoodle,"They nerfed damage, healing, and our mana pool (smart move blizzard, make us heal less AND give us less casts...)"
15-03-2020T08:52:46,AspiringNoodle,"Why?  The ""turbo"" comp in arena was a smidge too strong"
15-03-2020T08:53:33,AspiringNoodle,So obviously the answer was to make us hit like a wet noodle and make us squishy like marshmallow at the same time
15-03-2020T08:53:54,AspiringNoodle,"Couldn't have done one or the other, just HAD to do everything and be an overachiever :P"
15-03-2020T08:54:32,AspiringNoodle,"In all seriousness though, Blizzard is special, because they can break something and then leave it broken for 6 - 12 months.  It's not good."
15-03-2020T09:45:44,HoverdudeXL,hellooo
15-03-2020T10:54:21,AspiringNoodle,hai :P

15-03-2020T11:43:16,BlackjacksSec99,@xexanoth I play warships... can confirm they tweek EVERYTHING at once and it messes with dynamics and they are ALWAYS tweeking meaning players never really get used to things before they change again
15-03-2020T11:45:38,AspiringNoodle,I was a top 1k NA player in WoT :P
15-03-2020T11:45:52,AspiringNoodle,Not sure now though
15-03-2020T11:48:26,AspiringNoodle,"Heh, apparently even though I haven't played for years, my stats place me at #1798"
15-03-2020T11:51:18,AspiringNoodle,"World of tanks was a very fun game because once you learned the mechanics and quirks of every tank, you could abuse the HELL out of them and the terrain"
15-03-2020T11:51:41,AspiringNoodle,Favorite part was manipulating armor angles to bounce shots from the enemy
15-03-2020T11:57:38,BlackjacksSec99,"ive tried to get into tanks, but im so far behind everyone that I just get dumped on every game"
15-03-2020T11:59:29,BlackjacksSec99,"granted im only a low-mid warships player whos trying to break 50% win rate, but going 0-15 matches in tanks isint worth it"
15-03-2020T12:33:15,BlackjacksSec99,"so, question, whats the colors mean for screen names? It doesnt appear that I can change mine"
15-03-2020T13:06:35,BlackjacksSec99,.

15-03-2020T13:12:19,KeefMcDerpface,So how do you change the color.
15-03-2020T13:12:47,BlackjacksSec99,go to your own stream and in the chat options you can change color.
15-03-2020T13:13:16,KeefMcDerpface,Do you have to start a stream or can it be offline?
15-03-2020T13:13:58,BlackjacksSec99,you can do it offline
15-03-2020T13:14:02,KeefMcDerpface,k
15-03-2020T13:17:31,KeefMcDerpface,"hm, I see it but it says I need to be a premium member for it."
15-03-2020T13:17:59,BlackjacksSec99,? but Im a basic and it let me do it...
15-03-2020T13:18:12,BlackjacksSec99,one step above free
15-03-2020T13:18:27,TerraTheWizard,you don't need to go to your own stream
15-03-2020T13:18:39,TerraTheWizard,it's just in the cog at the top of chat
15-03-2020T13:18:50,TerraTheWizard,there's also one in the profile settings somewhere
15-03-2020T13:19:01,BlackjacksSec99,.....I am blind

15-03-2020T13:20:39,KeefMcDerpface,Now I can't see chat.
15-03-2020T13:20:54,KeefMcDerpface,The settings are blocking it.
15-03-2020T13:21:19,KeefMcDerpface,But I can still send messages.
15-03-2020T13:21:28,KeefMcDerpface,Gonna refresh
15-03-2020T13:21:45,KeefMcDerpface,"Yep, that fixed it."
15-03-2020T13:23:44,BlackjacksSec99,"aye, but you are still blue"
15-03-2020T13:23:52,KeefMcDerpface,Didn't change color.
15-03-2020T13:23:54,KeefMcDerpface,yet
15-03-2020T13:23:57,BlackjacksSec99,ahh
15-03-2020T13:25:25,BlackjacksSec99,I wonder if Tom ever drops by this chat when hes not streaming just to see what random nonsense people are talking about
15-03-2020T13:25:55,KeefMcDerpface,Like I said in a stream before. Tom is the ultimate lurker.
15-03-2020T13:26:51,TerraTheWizard,he do
15-03-2020T13:26:55,TerraTheWizard,sometimes
15-03-2020T13:27:13,TerraTheWizard,usually when he's working on patreon stuff
15-03-2020T13:27:20,BlackjacksSec99,is that why I feel like Im being watched??? :ctwokinds-zenshocked:
15-03-2020T13:27:47,BlackjacksSec99,"oh, nvm"
15-03-2020T13:27:51,BlackjacksSec99,its just my dogs

15-03-2020T13:28:49,AspiringNoodle,"Jack, don't feel bad, takes a while to learn those games :D"
15-03-2020T13:29:13,AspiringNoodle,"I love the progression element, but the biggest learning curve is learning the ins and outs of every map, as well as how every tank performs"
15-03-2020T13:29:30,BlackjacksSec99,it does.... Im at a year and a half in warships and just got my first tier 10 a month ago...
15-03-2020T13:29:40,BlackjacksSec99,"Love it though, even when im losing lol"
15-03-2020T13:29:48,AspiringNoodle,"I kinda want to return to WoT, bought like $120 worth of tanks over several years"
15-03-2020T13:29:55,AspiringNoodle,It was THAT fun
15-03-2020T13:30:26,AspiringNoodle,"When I bought my first one, I was a bit weary, because it was more or less the cost of a freaking AAA game.  But I didn't regret it xD"
15-03-2020T13:30:49,BlackjacksSec99,"yeah, I should probably spend more time with it. Just wish they had more co-ops for me to learn the ins and outs like warships with co-op and scenerio battles"
15-03-2020T13:31:25,AspiringNoodle,One of the things that helped me a lot was learning that the big gears for treads at the front and back of the tank are an easy recipe for de-treading a tank
15-03-2020T13:31:52,AspiringNoodle,"If you're REALLY good, you'll recognize when shooting the front gear will not only break the treads, but damage the tank at the same time"
15-03-2020T13:32:08,BlackjacksSec99,good to know
15-03-2020T13:32:37,AspiringNoodle,"I also learned that when it comes to dealing fatal damage to an enemy, learn where shooting has the highest chances of either detonating the ammo rack, or setting the tank on fire"
15-03-2020T13:33:00,AspiringNoodle,I have a fun little story to this effect :D
15-03-2020T13:33:10,BlackjacksSec99,I also need to work on tactics. hiding and whatnot

15-03-2020T13:34:01,AspiringNoodle,How did I get it?  I won it during the 5.2 / 5.3 (I can't remember which) XP J√§ger competition
15-03-2020T13:34:19,BlackjacksSec99,nice!
15-03-2020T13:34:48,AspiringNoodle,"In a single tier 5 - 7 match, I killed 12 tanks, dealt over 5,200 damage, and earned 2,033 base experience"

15-03-2020T13:38:52,AspiringNoodle,The first person I killed was actually a T27

15-03-2020T13:39:08,AspiringNoodle,"Fully upgraded, 1,250 health.  I two-shot him."
15-03-2020T13:40:01,AspiringNoodle,"Came in fast down a hill, trying to get close to me.  But heavy tanks don't do turning too well, especially when over their top rated speed going down hill.  I put a well-placed shot into his side just behind the turret and lit them on fire"
15-03-2020T13:40:41,AspiringNoodle,"They didn't have a fire extinguisher either, so that fire burnt for the full duration.  My 2nd shot just needed to love-tap them."
15-03-2020T13:40:56,AspiringNoodle,"From there, I more or less destroyed tier 5 - 6 tanks that were there to back him up"
15-03-2020T13:42:14,AspiringNoodle,"At the very end of the game, I ran out of my premium HEAT rounds, and had to use HE.  I killed an IS-2 by shooting its ass with those rounds xD"
15-03-2020T13:42:35,AspiringNoodle,"It's a shame I wasn't recording, would've been a great watch"

15-03-2020T23:50:14,steelabjur,I used to work with a crew that does FireSafe out here in Oregon. We'd go in and clear out the underbrush in the woods around a house. That job was a trip sometimes.
15-03-2020T23:51:38,steelabjur,I remember one job where I was on a near vertical surface with a chainsaw trying to cut brush while not falling off the side of the mountain with a running chainsaw.
