20-09-2020T01:48:36,CrimsonQuill,Good Morning
20-09-2020T01:48:46,CrimsonQuill,:ptv-greetings:
20-09-2020T01:48:55,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-renirar:
20-09-2020T01:49:16,CrimsonQuill,"Is anyone still up from the stream? (Also, Terra, your suggestion got sketched-and it was lovely!)"
20-09-2020T01:49:29,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-KeithNeat:
20-09-2020T01:56:23,AspiringNoodle,"I'm up, lol"
20-09-2020T01:56:30,AspiringNoodle,About to begin the last day of grinding in WoW >_>
20-09-2020T01:56:34,AspiringNoodle,Stupid OCD
20-09-2020T01:56:55,CrimsonQuill,Surveying lectures. They're coming online soon.
20-09-2020T01:58:27,AspiringNoodle,"Got at least... 4 hours of ""play"" ahead of me >_>"
20-09-2020T01:58:43,CrimsonQuill,Ooof/
20-09-2020T01:58:51,AspiringNoodle,Probably should see someone about my gaming tendencies
20-09-2020T01:58:57,CrimsonQuill,Ahahaha
20-09-2020T01:58:59,CrimsonQuill,A hahahahahaha
20-09-2020T01:59:00,AspiringNoodle,I'm not even doing it because I find it that enjoyable
20-09-2020T01:59:26,CrimsonQuill,"I hop from game to game, never enjoying one completely because I'm always worrying about what I 'could' be playing."
20-09-2020T01:59:29,AspiringNoodle,"I'm doing it to max out my cloak (rank 25), and get 2 toys from the one version of the instance that won't be back until a week later"
20-09-2020T01:59:46,AspiringNoodle,I'm starting to lose enjoyment in WoW because they try so hard to keep you playing
20-09-2020T01:59:59,AspiringNoodle,"But if BFA has shown anything, it's having the opposite effect"
20-09-2020T02:00:07,CrimsonQuill,"I'm like a child in a pile of sweets. Eat one and I can't eat another, so I sit in a pile of sweets yelling for a sweetie. Think that, except videogames."
20-09-2020T02:00:09,CrimsonQuill,Or videos.
20-09-2020T02:00:15,CrimsonQuill,Or pretty much anything.
20-09-2020T02:00:18,AspiringNoodle,"Don't make things that ""make"" people playing consistently for long periods of time."
20-09-2020T02:00:32,CrimsonQuill,WoW...I never got into it.
20-09-2020T02:00:36,AspiringNoodle,Make things that people *want* to play for long periods of time
20-09-2020T02:00:57,AspiringNoodle,Horrific Visions of N'zoth were fun at first
20-09-2020T02:01:10,AspiringNoodle,"But now it's a boring routine of ""Do X, Y, and Z"" for the millionth time"
20-09-2020T02:01:47,AspiringNoodle,"And I say I have about 4 hours of play time ahead of me, but that's ignoring the amount of time I had to spend playing to earn the currency to buy the token that gives me 1 entry into this s-show"
20-09-2020T02:02:33,AspiringNoodle,Yay for completionist / collector / ocd tendencies in an expansion desperately trying to wring out play time of the remaining MAU's so the shareholders don't freak >_>
20-09-2020T02:03:21,CrimsonQuill,Why not level up in DS3 while you wait for me to actually finish the damn game?
20-09-2020T02:03:52,CrimsonQuill,"(Hint: my character save DID disappear, and I'm trying to kill that crystal lizard thing at the start. And failing. Badly.)"
20-09-2020T02:04:06,CrimsonQuill,I am very...impatient with these games. Not a good combination.
20-09-2020T02:06:23,AspiringNoodle,Already at the level I want to be
20-09-2020T02:09:43,AspiringNoodle,"Tbh, part of the reason this grind is gonna be such a chore is because I don't particularly like this vision..."
20-09-2020T02:10:02,AspiringNoodle,"While it's a bit more linear in terms of progressing from area to area, each area is basically a mini labyrinth"
20-09-2020T02:10:23,AspiringNoodle,"It's not that hard to navigate, because almost nothing changes between runs, but the other vision is more enjoyable for me"
20-09-2020T02:10:32,AspiringNoodle,But this is the one with the only remaining goodies I need
20-09-2020T02:11:12,CrimsonQuill,I'm trying to motivate myself to jump in and actually FACE the Dark souls combat. I don't really handle difficulty well.
20-09-2020T02:11:19,CrimsonQuill,I generally brute force everything.
20-09-2020T02:12:04,CrimsonQuill,"It happened in Halo. I'd just brute force my way through, dying until I got to the next checkpoint. Speaking of which, ODST drops tomorrow...another Legendary Hell to jump feet first into..."
20-09-2020T02:12:35,CrimsonQuill,Currently I'm trying to beat all of the Halo games in MCC on legendary. It's...frustrating.
20-09-2020T02:13:34,CrimsonQuill,"A combination of my lack of skill, various factors weighing within each legendary, and my general impatience create a fustercluck of pain and anguish, punctuated by moments of happiness of finally beating a level."
20-09-2020T02:13:59,CrimsonQuill,"Oh, and I am mostly going straight in to Legendary. As in, playing on the hardest difficulty first time."
20-09-2020T02:14:09,CrimsonQuill,Without any intermediates.
20-09-2020T02:18:29,AspiringNoodle,"Surprise surprise, no toy off the rare..."
20-09-2020T02:18:44,CrimsonQuill,oooh dear
20-09-2020T02:19:04,AspiringNoodle,"It's annoying AF because it's a 10% droprate, and I have 10 attempts right now"
20-09-2020T02:19:21,AspiringNoodle,"If I don't get the toy off him by the end of this session, I'm gonna be SUPER pissed, because this is ignoring all the other times I've killed him"
20-09-2020T02:21:43,CrimsonQuill,All I can say is good luck.
20-09-2020T02:21:51,CrimsonQuill,"Lecture starting soon, I have to get ready"
20-09-2020T02:26:24,Dadrobit,Back from work
20-09-2020T02:26:41,Dadrobit,Kinda wanna boot up DS3 again myself. Haven't played it in forever.
20-09-2020T02:26:43,CrimsonQuill,"Cheerio guys, see you soon"
20-09-2020T02:26:47,CrimsonQuill,Lecture time
20-09-2020T02:26:56,CrimsonQuill,:ptv-greetings:
20-09-2020T02:27:30,Dadrobit,o/
20-09-2020T02:28:55,AspiringNoodle,"Dadro, would gladly assist / impede you :D"
20-09-2020T02:28:57,AspiringNoodle,Later quill
20-09-2020T02:31:12,Dadrobit,Would have to boot up the ol' PS4 and get everything installed and updated again
20-09-2020T02:31:59,AspiringNoodle,"Awwww, I'm on PC :c"
20-09-2020T02:33:55,AspiringNoodle,"PC's got all the fun mods.  Chasethebro is an invasion-oriented DS3 youtuber whose friend created the ""Honest Merchant"" mod"
20-09-2020T02:34:50,AspiringNoodle,"It replaces a corpse near the tower gate in the Shrine with another corpse who is the ""honest merchant"".  By performing one of four gestures, you gain access to various items menus, where you can buy just about every item in the game"
20-09-2020T02:34:59,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s 3 am & Bagheera wants to play
20-09-2020T02:35:21,AspiringNoodle,"For the low low price of 1 soul, any of these items can be yours~  Perfect for creating different builds for invasions."
20-09-2020T02:35:28,AspiringNoodle,boop the kitty on the snoot?
20-09-2020T02:37:33,Dadrobit,"Eh, it's whatever. Thinking I'm gonna go luck build"
20-09-2020T02:40:04,AspiringNoodle,"Uh, depending on what soul level you plan to make it, check out Chasethebro.  He actually did a luck build a year or two ago"
20-09-2020T02:40:17,AspiringNoodle,It was based around first poisoning an enemy and then pressuring with bleed
20-09-2020T02:42:14,Dadrobit,"Eh, I just kill the love interest NPC for their sword and call it a day"
20-09-2020T02:52:09,AspiringNoodle,"DS3 is a really good game, just feels like the tuning could've been better in some areas"
20-09-2020T02:52:22,AspiringNoodle,"Like, there are plenty of ""just why"" weapons where nothing about them makes up for their shortcomings"
20-09-2020T02:52:39,Dadrobit,"Gundyr down, on to the Dancer!"
20-09-2020T02:54:35,AspiringNoodle,"That reminds me, DS3 also has a fun few new mods out for making the game interesting"
20-09-2020T02:54:57,AspiringNoodle,"There's the Cinders mod (definitely don't play online with that mod, some stupidly broken custom items in there)"
20-09-2020T02:55:06,AspiringNoodle,And there's the Ascended mod which is the most recent
20-09-2020T02:55:27,AspiringNoodle,"That mod is so flippin' hardcore that when you make a new character, you start at soul level 25 - 30, depending on what class you pick."
20-09-2020T02:55:38,AspiringNoodle,And you'll STILL get your butt handed to you.
20-09-2020T02:55:59,AspiringNoodle,"Day 5, and Chasethebro is over soul level 220 with 90+ deaths."
20-09-2020T03:38:34,Dadrobit,"Alright, made it to the Dancer, no upgrades still, hitting like a wet noodle, let's see if I remember how to wreck shit."
20-09-2020T04:10:30,DarthRexKing,Bye all. o3o
20-09-2020T04:17:25,Dadrobit,"Daaaaaaamn, I think I mighta lost my touch."
20-09-2020T04:17:34,Dadrobit,Can get her into staeg
20-09-2020T04:18:03,Dadrobit,"Stage 3, but that's all she wrote for now."
20-09-2020T04:18:18,Dadrobit,"41 damage a hit, feels rough."

20-09-2020T13:57:51,AspiringNoodle,Hey terra
20-09-2020T14:01:33,AspiringNoodle,Man... last night was the fastest I think I've ever uninstalled Apex Legends
20-09-2020T14:01:52,AspiringNoodle,8 or 9 games and then booted.
20-09-2020T14:04:12,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,You’ve done it more then once?
20-09-2020T14:07:41,AspiringNoodle,"Yup, lol"
20-09-2020T14:08:11,AspiringNoodle,"Always for some reason or another.  But now it's heading into territories of ""until they change X, i'm done"" :P"
20-09-2020T14:09:09,AspiringNoodle,First time was because my old PC wasn't powerful enough to run it playable-y.  2nd time I think was because I was worried about how much time I was spending.  Third time same reason (I seriously binged this game those two times)
20-09-2020T14:09:51,AspiringNoodle,Fourth time (with a resolve to limit play times) was because of a no-reg issue.  And this time I was checking out if they changed how Treasure Packs worked.
20-09-2020T14:11:27,AspiringNoodle,I like shooters.  But F2P ones have... questionable monetization and they can change drastically.
20-09-2020T14:12:07,AspiringNoodle,But the ones you pay up front for have a habit of releasing new entries like clockwork
20-09-2020T14:13:38,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,"I like building games, I love City Skylines, love Minecraft, I like brick rigs. Also sometimes StormWorks"
20-09-2020T14:13:56,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,I LOVE BeamNG too
20-09-2020T14:14:19,AspiringNoodle,"More or less, I've noticed how heavily games are trying to retain your attention"
20-09-2020T14:15:05,AspiringNoodle,"WoW has gone too hard in this direction (and the subs for retail WoW reflect this), and Shadowlands might seriously be the last straw I have for this game."
20-09-2020T14:15:35,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,I don’t like fighting games much
20-09-2020T14:15:39,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,Not my style
20-09-2020T14:16:21,AspiringNoodle,Used to be studios were super happy if you purchased the game and enjoyed it so much that you bought the next entry and w/e dlc they put out
20-09-2020T14:16:28,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,I used to play Fortnite on Playground sometimes but even that wasn’t actually I fighting game
20-09-2020T14:16:55,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,"Well, fighting area I should say"
20-09-2020T14:17:37,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,:ptv-uneasy:
20-09-2020T14:17:59,AspiringNoodle,"Fortnite's a cool game, but the building mechanic, while being its greatest asset, is also its biggest weakness"
20-09-2020T14:18:21,AspiringNoodle,"There's such a high skill cap that if you joined later in the game's life, you're going to be DESTROYED by more experienced players."
20-09-2020T14:18:43,AspiringNoodle,"Doesn't matter if you're a god at FPS games, Fortnite's building mechanics seriously dictate the flow of combat."
20-09-2020T14:18:59,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,Ik
20-09-2020T14:19:09,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,I do like the building tho...
20-09-2020T14:19:15,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,That’s about all I like about it
20-09-2020T14:19:22,AspiringNoodle,"There have been games when I was attempting ranked where I could easily beat people in a firefight, but would lose because they were the better builders"
20-09-2020T14:21:09,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,I like Roblox too
20-09-2020T14:21:15,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,That’s one of my favorites
20-09-2020T14:21:27,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,I like how there’s so much different stuff
20-09-2020T14:21:45,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,.....even though...people can be pretty mean sometimes on there
20-09-2020T14:23:06,SpazztasticKiwi,🥤
20-09-2020T14:23:10,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,"Some games like MeepCity have these nice, giving, caring community when others like BloxBurg have mean, troll, aggressive community’s"
20-09-2020T14:23:40,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,It’s just the style od game I suppose
20-09-2020T14:23:44,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,Of*

20-09-2020T14:26:31,CrimsonQuill,:ctwokinds-kingtea: I have tea.
20-09-2020T14:26:36,CrimsonQuill,First lecture today.
20-09-2020T14:26:38,AspiringNoodle,"It's a shame, I seem to like games that have thriving content creation communities"
20-09-2020T14:26:42,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,Hot or ice?
20-09-2020T14:26:52,AspiringNoodle,But I don't have the confidence to try doing anything.  That and I'm super indecisive
20-09-2020T14:27:05,AspiringNoodle,"Iced is the only tea, don't @ me"
20-09-2020T14:27:11,CrimsonQuill,Hot tea. Barrys or 'Blueshirt' tea
20-09-2020T14:27:19,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,I didn’t @ you?
20-09-2020T14:27:47,AspiringNoodle,"Lol, you have a lot to learn :P"
20-09-2020T14:27:48,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,"Mmm, hot tea. Sounds nice"
20-09-2020T14:28:21,CrimsonQuill,Very refreshing!
20-09-2020T14:28:33,CrimsonQuill,I underwent a FAIL last night during the stream.
20-09-2020T14:28:37,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,It’s still hot where I live. I still need cool drinks
20-09-2020T14:28:46,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,Op
20-09-2020T14:28:52,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,What happened?
20-09-2020T14:29:00,CrimsonQuill,"Well, remember I was talking about Banhammers?"
20-09-2020T14:29:12,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,Mhm
20-09-2020T14:29:16,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,What about it?
20-09-2020T14:29:33,CrimsonQuill,...I tried to draw a 2v2 banhammer battle.
20-09-2020T14:29:52,CrimsonQuill,"Flora and Adelaide on one side, my OC Thomas and another Halo artist's OC on the other."
20-09-2020T14:30:06,CrimsonQuill,Except...I haven't looked at any Clip Studio Paint tutorials.
20-09-2020T14:30:07,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,Lol
20-09-2020T14:30:12,CrimsonQuill,I got the proportions wrong.
20-09-2020T14:30:19,CrimsonQuill,I couldn't figure out the poses.
20-09-2020T14:30:20,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,Uh oh XD
20-09-2020T14:30:43,CrimsonQuill,"So after about an hour's frustrated sketching I gave up, and just drew a head portrait of my Chonky Boi Thomas.,"
20-09-2020T14:32:13,CrimsonQuill,I really need to look at tutorials.
20-09-2020T14:32:37,CrimsonQuill,"Edgewalker (my friend) has, and has already made some pretty sweet lineart."
20-09-2020T14:35:38,AspiringNoodle,"If I ever start posting art, I'll be changing my name :P"
20-09-2020T14:37:17,CrimsonQuill,AspiringNoodle not a name you wish to keep for such an endeavor?
20-09-2020T14:37:43,AspiringNoodle,"Was a temp name I came up with in 5 seconds when I created my picarto account, haha"
20-09-2020T14:37:46,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
20-09-2020T14:38:03,CrimsonQuill,Good night Terra!
20-09-2020T14:38:17,AspiringNoodle,"Although, if I take any longer, I might as well keep it, because everyone seems to know it xD"
20-09-2020T14:38:25,CrimsonQuill,@AspiringNoodle I changed mine from Avenger to Quill.
20-09-2020T14:38:30,CrimsonQuill,CrimsonAvenger-CrimsonQuill
20-09-2020T14:38:33,CrimsonQuill,Seemed nicer.
20-09-2020T14:41:04,AspiringNoodle,"Huh... there's an idea, lol"
20-09-2020T14:41:22,AspiringNoodle,"If I ever make more money and start giving Tom $10 a month, got 2 sketch ideas in the bank"
20-09-2020T14:41:34,AspiringNoodle,"""Maddie found a Red Bull... oh no..."""
20-09-2020T14:41:51,AspiringNoodle,"and ""Maeve found a baby snake and decided to keep it."""
20-09-2020T14:42:01,AspiringNoodle,"""Adira doesn't seem pleased."""
20-09-2020T14:42:12,CrimsonQuill,"Hehe, well, last year I came back from a three month attempted breather to find that just 2 days after I'd left my Halfkind Kiss suggestion had been sketched."
20-09-2020T14:42:17,CrimsonQuill,Then i found it had been coloured.
20-09-2020T14:42:23,CrimsonQuill,The irony....
20-09-2020T14:58:51,AspiringNoodle,Been listening to that anniversary concert of Undertale

20-09-2020T15:57:08,AspiringNoodle,Hopes & Dreams is a song that brings all the feels
20-09-2020T16:01:21,K3IDRAN,What. K3IDRAN does when he's bored: Dance to Elder scrolls memes with. Dagoth Ur and. Jarl Balgruuf
20-09-2020T16:02:40,K3IDRAN,Flint: *Dies  cus even Elder scrolls memes can Eliminate a demon*
20-09-2020T16:05:30,CrimsonQuill,drowns themself in Halo music
20-09-2020T16:07:00,K3IDRAN,Demons of Brianwood: I'm dying it's too much ahhhh
20-09-2020T16:08:54,K3IDRAN,Kevin: (my Skyrim char) what just happened?
20-09-2020T16:09:49,CrimsonQuill,"I'm considering making an RP series in Skyrim once I have a modded game set up...but would anyone really care? Besides, I'm trying to do so many other things...it's rather wearing."
20-09-2020T16:10:47,K3IDRAN,I feel your pain man
20-09-2020T16:13:38,K3IDRAN,Ember: *casually reading a book while Kevin loots flint*
20-09-2020T16:14:22,CrimsonQuill,XD
20-09-2020T16:14:52,CrimsonQuill,"I think I shall head for the night. I still need to find some Clip tutorials, cure my short attention span, and get ready for lectures tomorrow."
20-09-2020T16:14:58,CrimsonQuill,Or I might lurk...
20-09-2020T16:15:02,CrimsonQuill,Lurking is good.
20-09-2020T16:15:05,CrimsonQuill,Lurking is fun.
20-09-2020T16:16:10,K3IDRAN,I  like spreading. Meme magic
20-09-2020T16:26:12,K3IDRAN,I harvest the power of Memes so i can conjure new ones on the internet
20-09-2020T16:28:32,CrimsonQuill,I find memes to be a mixed bag
20-09-2020T16:29:59,K3IDRAN,"""Their are good memes and. Their bad memes"" - Pink Guy"
20-09-2020T16:49:40,CrimsonQuill,True that
20-09-2020T17:00:29,K3IDRAN,Demon hunting patrol: So you guys wanna get a beer or something?
20-09-2020T17:03:36,K3IDRAN,And that's how Bloodline ended by 3 meme lords spreading their Memes
20-09-2020T17:04:18,CrimsonQuill,xd
20-09-2020T17:04:19,CrimsonQuill,XD
20-09-2020T17:04:41,CrimsonQuill,"I need to read that comic 'Bloodlines', I believe it's called, by W0lfmare"
20-09-2020T17:05:43,K3IDRAN,You are correct
20-09-2020T17:08:25,K3IDRAN,http://w0lfmare.xepher.net/?comic=pg-1-2

20-09-2020T17:10:44,K3IDRAN,The world reminds me if Skyrim when you put forest mods into it
20-09-2020T17:11:34,CrimsonQuill,I see the resemblance.
20-09-2020T17:11:56,CrimsonQuill,"Anyhow, I need to go to bed. Got to be up on time tomorrow!"

20-09-2020T18:15:47,AspiringNoodle,"Crysis Remastered has gone meta, boys"
20-09-2020T18:15:55,AspiringNoodle,They have a graphics setting
20-09-2020T18:16:04,AspiringNoodle,"And it is called ""Can It Run Crysis?"""
20-09-2020T18:16:43,AspiringNoodle,RTX Titan @ 4k was averaging a whopping 22 FPS for LTT.  Time will tell how much of that is the game still being developed / optimized.
20-09-2020T18:26:16,CrRAR,guys
20-09-2020T18:26:25,CrRAR,this is bad

20-09-2020T20:23:15,tehbear,"might as well read a few pages of Bloodline, have not read it in forever"
20-09-2020T20:23:47,Ordithus,:cw0lfmare-EmberShock2:
20-09-2020T20:26:00,tehbear,does anyone else here sometimes read comics backwards?
20-09-2020T20:26:45,Ordithus,"no, that would not work well"
20-09-2020T20:27:15,tehbear,"oh, but it can work, you take the facts you learn about future events in the story"
20-09-2020T20:27:35,tehbear,and anticipate what made them occur in the past
20-09-2020T20:27:47,tehbear,its not so different from reading a comic forward really
20-09-2020T20:27:54,tehbear,its a bit harder with books
20-09-2020T20:29:55,tehbear,"and even harder with movies, as you would need to be some kind of idiot savant to understand speech backwards in real time"
20-09-2020T20:30:33,tehbear,"but comics can be read backwards, as the pages are a snapshot in time of the story"
20-09-2020T20:30:49,tehbear,and then you go page by page back in time
20-09-2020T20:34:10,tehbear,its like being a detective.
20-09-2020T20:34:16,tehbear,you arrive on the murder scene
20-09-2020T20:34:25,tehbear,there are clues
20-09-2020T20:42:19,K3IDRAN,"Bloodliine made me Interested back in The Elder Scrolls"""

20-09-2020T20:53:31,Ordithus,haha d'aww.  the introspection is a bit too smart for Brutus but the reaction reads right

20-09-2020T22:19:56,Twokinds,mmm yeah it'd be hard to do something like that as a sketch suggestion
20-09-2020T22:25:39,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
20-09-2020T22:29:41,K3IDRAN,Ordi your a Bloodline expert answer this can flint even be kilied
20-09-2020T22:54:49,SpazztasticKiwi,I finally figured out what the fall guys music sounds like
20-09-2020T22:54:55,SpazztasticKiwi,danny phantom
20-09-2020T22:57:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"also, can we get a scene where, after explaining to that tsa man she can’t be separated from her lamp, the air marshals are on the phone with the plane pilot on how they managed to loose a whole passenger 1000000 ft in the air"
20-09-2020T22:58:02,SpazztasticKiwi,because she snapped back to the lamp after so much distance
