15-06-2020T00:22:33,AspiringNoodle,"While it is still definitely horror, now I'm destroying a giant machine :D"
15-06-2020T00:56:31,AspiringNoodle,Well that was downright terrifying
15-06-2020T01:16:43,AspiringNoodle,Aaaaaaaaaaaaand done.  Boy did that get the heart pumping at the end

15-06-2020T14:22:24,Dadrobit,"Blah, this morning suuuucked."
15-06-2020T14:24:03,Dadrobit,House burnt down at one of the properties at my post. Had to spend the last few hours coordinating with fire rescue and the HOA. Then spent the last hour playing whack a mole with news crews trying to get on scene with camera cranes and drones.
15-06-2020T14:24:34,Dadrobit,And now I can't freakin sleep when I've only gotten like 3 hours.
15-06-2020T14:26:03,AspiringNoodle,At this point your body is running on adrenaline
15-06-2020T14:39:04,AspiringNoodle,"3 more weeks then vacation, yay~"
15-06-2020T14:39:30,AspiringNoodle,"And by that I mean combination vacation / job search, ahahahaha"
15-06-2020T17:05:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I can’t believe bananas are classified as berries
15-06-2020T17:57:53,CrRAR,Coffee also is a berry
15-06-2020T17:58:02,CrRAR,:coffee::ccrrar-coffee:

15-06-2020T20:52:00,CrRAR,it did NOT work as intended

15-06-2020T21:55:34,CrRAR,in case you want carbs with yo carbs
15-06-2020T21:55:36,RimaDraws,no
15-06-2020T21:56:36,CrRAR,"white pizza (garlicy, cream sauce) is good once in a while"
15-06-2020T21:57:23,RimaDraws,not good lol
15-06-2020T21:57:33,RimaDraws,does not sound goodat all
15-06-2020T21:57:36,CrRAR,"yeah, it's take or leave it"
15-06-2020T21:57:46,CrRAR,like pesto
15-06-2020T21:57:57,CrRAR,Very polarizing foods
15-06-2020T21:58:27,CrRAR,pesto is a weird one for me
15-06-2020T21:58:49,CrRAR,feel like it belongs on a cracker
15-06-2020T21:58:54,CrRAR,not at dinner
15-06-2020T21:58:57,CrRAR,lol
15-06-2020T21:59:00,Ordithus,pesto is good on bread
15-06-2020T21:59:05,CrRAR,yesssss
15-06-2020T22:01:00,CrRAR,breads and oils and herbs and spices
15-06-2020T22:01:07,SpazztasticKiwi,"it’s effectively flat alfredo, that’s all"
15-06-2020T22:01:10,SpazztasticKiwi,tastes the same
15-06-2020T22:01:33,SpazztasticKiwi,pizza hut has a chicken bacon parmesan pizza I might try tomorrow thanks to you
15-06-2020T22:01:47,CrRAR,"through your description, I live vicariously"
15-06-2020T22:01:59,CrRAR,legit
15-06-2020T22:02:57,CrRAR,Dear diary: Wednesday will be GOOD day
15-06-2020T22:05:38,SpazztasticKiwi,only thing I don’t get is the tomatoes
15-06-2020T22:06:03,SpazztasticKiwi,they add little tomato pieces on top with the chicken & bacon
15-06-2020T22:14:04,CrRAR,"that makes sense if it was, like, buffalo chicken"
15-06-2020T22:14:09,CrRAR,they confused
15-06-2020T22:14:34,CrRAR,"""Stop putting BERRIES on mah pizza!!!"""
15-06-2020T22:14:40,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-flomad:
15-06-2020T22:15:28,CrRAR,"""Keidrain-friendly hold everything but the chicken bacon"""
15-06-2020T22:15:41,CrRAR,":ctwokinds-keifacepalm: ""Keidran"""
15-06-2020T22:15:58,CrRAR,"""plz"""
15-06-2020T22:23:59,SpazztasticKiwi,what’s it supposed to do
15-06-2020T22:24:05,SpazztasticKiwi,enhance the sauce
15-06-2020T22:24:16,SpazztasticKiwi,& they also got a buffalo pizza
15-06-2020T22:25:30,CrRAR,Usually it mellows out and provides alkaline flavor contrast.
15-06-2020T22:25:33,CrRAR,:9
15-06-2020T22:26:00,CrRAR,...but WHO wants to stifle the Ranch goodness!?
15-06-2020T22:26:44,CrRAR,"Flavor contrast is important in certain things, it's why certain wines ""pair"" well with certain dishes and meats"
15-06-2020T22:27:06,CrRAR,"Helps ""reset"" the palate between bites"
15-06-2020T22:27:19,CrRAR,so you can appreciated the meal more
15-06-2020T22:27:56,CrRAR,"Like how they say ""you don't miss something till its gone""."
15-06-2020T22:28:44,CrRAR,you get to experience the flavor all over again.
15-06-2020T22:41:07,RimaDraws,i missed alot
