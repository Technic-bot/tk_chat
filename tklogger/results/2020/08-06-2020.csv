08-06-2020T21:56:16,CrRAR,When we all just ARE (somewhat in the Bhuddist sense) is when we know peace has won.

08-06-2020T22:38:17,AspiringNoodle,"Ugh, stupid notice letter"
08-06-2020T22:38:45,AspiringNoodle,"Can't decide to go short or long, or if it's even necessary to go through the ""proper"" bs since this is a freaking cashier job at a gas station -_-"
08-06-2020T22:39:47,Ordithus,"all it needs to say is that you're resigning as of such a date,"
08-06-2020T22:40:48,AspiringNoodle,"Well then, that's good, because this is what I've finalized so far, lol"
08-06-2020T22:40:52,Ordithus,"Literally, ""I, Noodle, am resigning effective 7/1/2020.  Signed, Noodle, 6/10/2020"""

08-06-2020T22:45:04,AspiringNoodle,How big should I make the font?
08-06-2020T22:45:23,Ordithus,72 point windings

08-06-2020T22:45:38,Ordithus,:cw0lfmare-EmberTooHappy:
08-06-2020T22:46:01,AspiringNoodle,"To be clear, I like my coworkers"
08-06-2020T22:46:57,AspiringNoodle,But I draw the line at them changing store hours such that people working on 2nd shift have to stay 1 - 1.5 hours later than is normal
08-06-2020T22:47:19,AspiringNoodle,Going from manning the store solo for 3 hours up from 1 hour (not counting half hour of closing)
08-06-2020T22:47:40,AspiringNoodle,And basically telling us to suck it up and not giving us a choice
08-06-2020T22:48:44,Ordithus,"yeah, places have a way of changing the terms of the job and say do or quit"
08-06-2020T22:49:48,AspiringNoodle,here's an example of why I take huge issue with the changes
08-06-2020T22:50:22,AspiringNoodle,"Last week, and this week, I swapped every shift I was scheduled for with a coworker, so she has the 3 - 9 shift, and I have the 5 - 12:30 shift (next week 6 - 12:30)"
08-06-2020T22:50:40,AspiringNoodle,She's a single mother and currently is living with her mother and has a small child (5 - 6yo boy)
08-06-2020T22:50:55,AspiringNoodle,She's started going back to school and needed to switch from first to 2nd shift to do it
08-06-2020T22:51:47,AspiringNoodle,"When the store hours changed with less than a week's notice, she was stuck with the closer for all 5 shifts"
08-06-2020T22:51:54,Ordithus,the number of times I reminded McD's that I couldn't close Friday and open Saturday... there was less than 6 hours between
08-06-2020T22:52:30,AspiringNoodle,"The problem is, she lives an hour away and if she holds the shift, by the time she'd get home at around 1:30 - 2, her mother would be leaving for work"
08-06-2020T22:53:02,AspiringNoodle,"This opens up the potential for her child to be home alone, not even considering any huge delays"
08-06-2020T22:53:22,AspiringNoodle,"Manager's response? ""The company needs"" and ""you should make arrangements"""
08-06-2020T22:53:30,AspiringNoodle,"I like my manager, but jesus fucking christ man"
08-06-2020T22:53:32,AspiringNoodle,Read the room
08-06-2020T22:54:16,AspiringNoodle,"As such, there's only one such recourse, and I'm not a fan of it because it'll probably dick over my coworkers"
08-06-2020T22:54:26,AspiringNoodle,But I'm tired of the BS
08-06-2020T22:55:28,AspiringNoodle,"Also, you and my coworkers could write volumes about that.  The number of times my coworkers had to bounce early because they were schedule for first the following day >_>"
08-06-2020T22:55:51,AspiringNoodle,"Alright, I think that's enough wall of text for the week."
08-06-2020T22:56:03,Ordithus,crap situation
08-06-2020T22:56:33,AspiringNoodle,Luckily I still live with the parents
08-06-2020T22:57:24,AspiringNoodle,"I don't want that to be a permanent situation, but given everything that's going on in current year, it's a major blessing"
08-06-2020T22:58:09,AspiringNoodle,"Ord, you think retail / fast food workers will ever say ""enough is enough"" and unionize?"
08-06-2020T22:58:37,Ordithus,I've heard about people trying
08-06-2020T22:58:50,Ordithus,Hasn't gotten too far yet
08-06-2020T22:59:16,AspiringNoodle,"Doesn't help that big corporations are hella guilty of union busting, but the courts always go, ""Hmmmm, nothing to prosecute here."""
08-06-2020T22:59:25,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-unimpressed:
08-06-2020T22:59:54,CrRAR,Too big a pool of labor sadly
08-06-2020T23:00:07,AspiringNoodle,"I think my favorite one was a Walmart meat department that attempted to unionize, and then it mysteriously got axed a short while later"
08-06-2020T23:00:17,CrRAR,Unemployed folks lining up just to take the jobs
08-06-2020T23:00:27,AspiringNoodle,"""What? Noooooooo, this wasn't in retaliation to union efforts.  We were planning on getting rid of that department anyways!"""
08-06-2020T23:00:40,CrRAR,lol
08-06-2020T23:00:47,AspiringNoodle,More or less EVERY time
08-06-2020T23:00:50,CrRAR,Too much trouble
08-06-2020T23:01:05,AspiringNoodle,I have a sinking feeling that eventually everything will just implode
08-06-2020T23:01:24,CrRAR,Like when a product gets cut for not being popular enough
08-06-2020T23:01:33,AspiringNoodle,"Like, if you think these riots are bad, imagine how bad it'll be if the ""essential employees"" say enough is enough and just refuse to do anything"
08-06-2020T23:02:19,CrRAR,Yeah I don’t think this thing is completely over
08-06-2020T23:02:46,CrRAR,There’s been little of the financial impact felt yet
08-06-2020T23:03:31,CrRAR,Any contraction in consumer spending or ability to pay loans hasn’t really happened
08-06-2020T23:03:58,Ordithus,it will be... interesting... to say the least once the eviction protections run out ....
08-06-2020T23:04:10,Ordithus,and foreclosure
08-06-2020T23:04:14,CrRAR,"It could just blow over, but that’s assuming everyone 1:1 gets back to work post-stimulus"
08-06-2020T23:04:23,CrRAR,Yeah ord
08-06-2020T23:05:29,CrRAR,"I don’t see how something so major, stimulus or not, doesn’t have some other negative effect"
08-06-2020T23:06:27,CrRAR,...but maybe if it isn’t as bad as it weems the stimulus got though and juiced a situation that may have been overblown haha
08-06-2020T23:06:47,CrRAR,"*seems, through"
08-06-2020T23:08:06,CrRAR,Still I feel like it’s just scaling the economy’s grades keeping it an A just a teensy bit longer.
08-06-2020T23:09:39,AspiringNoodle,"Sadly, I feel like the economy is going to implode in the near future for other reasons"
08-06-2020T23:10:03,AspiringNoodle,Such as the government idiotically focusing on things like GDP and stock performance to gauge how well the economy's doing
08-06-2020T23:10:49,AspiringNoodle,"Meanwhile, those things have absolutely no relevance to things like: happiness per person, underemployment, welfare utilization, and so on"
08-06-2020T23:11:10,AspiringNoodle,"Things that, coincidentally, have buck all interest from any major organization when it comes to gauging how much a society is ""flourishing"""
08-06-2020T23:12:22,AspiringNoodle,"Oh, unemployment was at an all time low before the pandemic?"
08-06-2020T23:12:47,AspiringNoodle,"How much of that was due to fluff and the absurdly lax standards that count as ""employment""?"

08-06-2020T23:17:44,AspiringNoodle,Or am I JUST young enough for it???

08-06-2020T23:49:07,AspiringNoodle,How effective is this design?  Well one truck had its entire hitch assembly torn from the frame
08-06-2020T23:49:23,AspiringNoodle,"And another car, when brought to a stop, had the mailbox. In the engine bay."
08-06-2020T23:49:42,AspiringNoodle,RIP
