24-07-2020T00:20:22,Roughlandin,Steel I will punch my bear hands through your screen
24-07-2020T00:20:24,Ordithus,c'mon one has green hair the other purple get it right
24-07-2020T00:20:27,Dadrobit,I recall one from the 80's that was literally just a dude traveling across the land to fix his sex robot he broke in the bath. PG-13 is good enough.
24-07-2020T00:20:33,AspiringNoodle,Mike will get *poofed* into FemMike for the extra cushion :P
24-07-2020T00:20:47,Dadrobit,Cherry 2000 iirc
24-07-2020T00:20:52,Roughlandin,Dad are you describing the plot of Johnny 5?
24-07-2020T00:21:01,steelabjur,"I remember that one, Dad!"
24-07-2020T00:21:06,KeefMcDerpface,"lol, Rough"
24-07-2020T00:21:22,KeefMcDerpface,"""No disassemble."""
24-07-2020T00:21:26,Roughlandin,"Glad I'm not the only one who remembers that movie, Keef"
24-07-2020T00:21:29,Dadrobit,"No, johnny 5 was not alive in this universe"
24-07-2020T00:21:31,SageSaga,i remember a movie where a kid is sitting in the back of a car and his father falls out a window ontop of the car- his face going through the windshield splattering the kid in his fathers blood- Rated PG
24-07-2020T00:21:50,johnnytho,nice
24-07-2020T00:21:52,Roughlandin,Was that a movie or a 90s seatbelt PSA?
24-07-2020T00:21:54,steelabjur,"""Johnny 5 is Alive!"""
24-07-2020T00:22:11,MuonNeutrino,"@Twokinds on a completely different topic, could we possibly get a highres version of the big Rose Garden wide shot panel from a couple strips ago? It's such an impressive shot"
24-07-2020T00:22:23,Werewing,I think I saw a horror movie with that scene.
24-07-2020T00:22:25,BlackjackSec99,Indiana Jones is PG lol
24-07-2020T00:22:35,SageSaga,It was Burnt Offerings from 1976
24-07-2020T00:22:41,Ordithus,internet is dying again
24-07-2020T00:22:46,Ordithus,whyyy
24-07-2020T00:22:51,Roughlandin,That's a very PG sounding title
24-07-2020T00:22:56,BlackjackSec99,"melting people, rotting corpses, horrific injuries.... PG"
24-07-2020T00:22:59,Werewing,"Make a blood sacrifice, Ord."
24-07-2020T00:23:08,Roughlandin,Somebody get more hamsters for Ords interwebs
24-07-2020T00:23:14,SageSaga,its the story of a haunted house that consumes people to keep itself mantained
24-07-2020T00:23:15,KeefMcDerpface,:ptv-shock:
24-07-2020T00:23:20,SageSaga,kinda like Traces house here-
24-07-2020T00:23:29,Roughlandin,...Did Monster House steal that movie's plot?
24-07-2020T00:23:32,KeefMcDerpface,^
24-07-2020T00:23:34,Werewing,Demand the internet Deimons release their hold on the holy data packets.
24-07-2020T00:23:47,MuonNeutrino,"ohhhh, neat, illusion-maren's reflection is only on the fake part of the floor"
24-07-2020T00:23:58,Werewing,Only two people were consumed by that house.
24-07-2020T00:24:00,Xonalladro,ecrusade
24-07-2020T00:24:13,Dadrobit,Logan's Run was PG for whatever reason as well. Has a whole scene with a nude dancing club.
24-07-2020T00:24:19,CrimsonHelsing,good observation Neutrino
24-07-2020T00:24:31,CrimsonHelsing,ofc Karen would miss that xP
24-07-2020T00:24:39,MarvTheHugPharaoh,16 candles was also PG
24-07-2020T00:24:47,MuonNeutrino,"eh, can't really blame her, that's a pretty subtle detail"
24-07-2020T00:24:52,MuonNeutrino,in the moment
24-07-2020T00:25:09,Roughlandin,The Emoji Movie was PG and that was the most profane thing I've ever seen put to film
24-07-2020T00:25:09,MuonNeutrino,the bigger red flag ought to be the *entire platform suddenly being longer* >.>
24-07-2020T00:25:18,CrimsonHelsing,yea xP
24-07-2020T00:25:23,Roughlandin,And I didn't even SEE the Emoji Movie
24-07-2020T00:25:33,Xonalladro,i was forced to watch the emoji movie in french class
24-07-2020T00:25:37,CrimsonHelsing,neither did I. I could tell that one was awful xP

24-07-2020T00:27:45,AspiringNoodle,And YOU were the one who paid for it...
24-07-2020T00:27:54,CrimsonHelsing,kinda like The Cat in the Hat xP

24-07-2020T00:28:46,AspiringNoodle,They had more of a commentary on the internet than anything else
24-07-2020T00:28:55,AspiringNoodle,The Emoji Movie just explained what everything did
24-07-2020T00:29:04,AspiringNoodle,THEY EXPLAINED HOW TO PLAY CANDY CRUSH FOR CRYING OUT LOUD
24-07-2020T00:29:19,Roughlandin,WHY did they not call it Ralph Wrecks the Internet? I still don't understand...

24-07-2020T00:40:42,SageSaga,they are some of my favorite parts
24-07-2020T00:41:07,AspiringNoodle,I might need to find that one clip on twitter
24-07-2020T00:41:18,AspiringNoodle,It showed how a studio broke down a major effects heavy action scene
24-07-2020T00:41:26,AspiringNoodle,Was mind blowing
24-07-2020T00:42:09,AspiringNoodle,I love the little hint in panel 2 that confirms what people suspected

24-07-2020T00:43:53,CrimsonHelsing,and clearly Karen's memory wasn't all that good.
24-07-2020T00:43:55,Xonalladro,she was kind of hiding over the corner bit
24-07-2020T00:45:24,AspiringNoodle,"Ladies and gentlefurs, we have found the glitch in the matrix"
24-07-2020T00:46:14,Xonalladro,"dont touch it, it could be dangerous"

24-07-2020T00:46:42,AspiringNoodle,The character doing the cosplay or the cosplay itself?
24-07-2020T00:46:47,SageSaga,Lia as Aqua from Konosuba

24-07-2020T00:46:55,Ordithus,thankie
24-07-2020T00:46:59,CrimsonHelsing,"seems a bit oddly specific a way for the estate to attempt to kill Karen in particular, isn't it?"
24-07-2020T00:47:01,Zakuru,lol
24-07-2020T00:47:19,AspiringNoodle,"Crimson, this is *Trace's* mansion"
24-07-2020T00:47:25,CrimsonHelsing,I know
24-07-2020T00:47:32,AspiringNoodle,"You know, same dude who went full genocidal megalomaniac xD"
24-07-2020T00:47:43,CrimsonHelsing,I know that
24-07-2020T00:47:44,Werewing,And cursed her to begin with.
24-07-2020T00:47:47,AspiringNoodle,Of course his mansion would be just as twisted in its attempts to off people :snail:
24-07-2020T00:47:51,Ordithus,Trace did find her annoying...
24-07-2020T00:48:03,Werewing,Maybe it wants to complete the curse.
24-07-2020T00:48:15,Zakuru,he did
24-07-2020T00:48:17,Zakuru,on mary
24-07-2020T00:48:17,unsteddyphoenix,Shit he DID think she was annoying!
24-07-2020T00:48:17,Werewing,Maybe we will see full cat Karen in Canon.

24-07-2020T00:48:23,unsteddyphoenix,And he experimented on her already lol
24-07-2020T00:48:55,CrimsonHelsing,really hope we find out soon just *why* the estate is trying to kill everyone
24-07-2020T00:49:20,CrimsonHelsing,"as far as I can tell, it's completely unnecessary, outside of maybe ""no witnesses"""
24-07-2020T00:49:47,Xonalladro,well rose has control of the estate
24-07-2020T00:50:04,CrimsonHelsing,"not that I'm complaining, no, Trace's plan just eludes the reader (for obvious reasons ofc)"
24-07-2020T00:50:07,Ordithus,might not after Maren triggered the main event
24-07-2020T00:50:10,InTheLionsDen,Clovis is in the control room and has taken control.
24-07-2020T00:50:27,sodaYEET,Rose just think it's the good old day where master Trace lured people in the estate and kill all of em
24-07-2020T00:50:32,johnnytho,Clovis has assumed control
24-07-2020T00:50:44,CrimsonHelsing,"@Xonalladro  Uhh, not anymore apparently"
24-07-2020T00:51:06,Majyxs,Trace's mansion has to dish out that soul thrashing black sorcery.
24-07-2020T00:51:07,CrimsonHelsing,remember she couldn't end the lockdown in the nursery/garden corridor when Stoney attacked?
24-07-2020T00:51:16,hyneria,"couldn't rose be doing this, tho?"
24-07-2020T00:51:31,Xonalladro,well trace removed the restriction
24-07-2020T00:51:31,CrimsonHelsing,"no? She has no control over the lockdowns, I just said"
24-07-2020T00:52:01,hyneria,Trace removed all restrains
24-07-2020T00:52:16,Ordithus,maybe but it would be a big shift in character to go from chumming it up with Trace and Raine to murdering all of his new friends
24-07-2020T00:52:41,CrimsonHelsing,"yes but she still couldn't end the lockdown, I keep telling you hyneria"
24-07-2020T00:53:03,AspiringNoodle,"It's quite possible that the Rose we've known all along was either a younger mentality preserved by the magic, or just another facet of the restrictions"
24-07-2020T00:53:07,unsteddyphoenix,Nah im all for it Rose killing spree woooo~
24-07-2020T00:53:23,hyneria,I think there are two Rose- We have seen one has the red text boxes and one has the green ones
24-07-2020T00:53:24,AspiringNoodle,"And now that the limiter's been removed, all that pent up anger and hate is able to flow forth"
24-07-2020T00:53:27,Xonalladro,much death
24-07-2020T00:53:34,CrimsonHelsing,"restrictions or no, she doesn't completely have control over everything from what I'm looking at"
24-07-2020T00:53:57,CrimsonHelsing,I still think this could be the estate acting automatically as per the trap set for Maren
24-07-2020T00:53:59,AspiringNoodle,"That said, we still don't know the extent to which Trace's depraved magic / research has gone"
24-07-2020T00:54:07,Mediawatcher,"This page is extremely anxiety inducing, can‚Äôt wait to see what happens next tom!"
24-07-2020T00:54:15,hyneria,Rose joked about planning Trace's demise
24-07-2020T00:54:17,AspiringNoodle,Rose could just be a battery for other fun things
24-07-2020T00:54:23,CrimsonHelsing,"kinda hope for a double post, but if not that's fine"
24-07-2020T00:54:24,hyneria,maybe she actually went along with it
24-07-2020T00:54:25,Mediawatcher,Tom isn‚Äôt pulling the brakes at all this chapter!
24-07-2020T00:55:08,Twokinds,:steam_locomotive::railway_car::railway_car::railway_car:
24-07-2020T00:55:17,Mediawatcher,Haha!
24-07-2020T00:55:17,Zakuru,hehe
24-07-2020T00:55:19,Xonalladro,"tom did stream 4 days this week, give him a break"
24-07-2020T00:55:19,Mediawatcher,ü§£
24-07-2020T00:55:34,CrimsonHelsing,noice xD
24-07-2020T00:55:46,CrimsonHelsing,"and yeah, like I said it's cool"
24-07-2020T00:55:47,Majyxs,"The train it won't stop going, no, it won't slow down!"
24-07-2020T00:55:56,Ordithus,"in this case Karen's the damsel in distress, tied to the tracks"
24-07-2020T00:56:11,Mediawatcher,"Oh god, when I was thinking a character would die, I didn‚Äôt think it‚Äôd be Karen of all people!"
24-07-2020T00:56:20,Ordithus,"Maren was also, but we didn't really see what happened"
24-07-2020T00:56:22,sodaYEET,this is why I always try to catch these streams the chat is lit
24-07-2020T00:56:36,Zakuru,let the boys catch her or something :sob:
24-07-2020T00:56:39,InTheLionsDen,Evals and/or Mike will catch her.
24-07-2020T00:56:42,hyneria,"I'm sure Maddie will save her, hence starting the MaddiexKaren ship :P"
24-07-2020T00:56:49,hyneria,"Or Nibbly, somehow"
24-07-2020T00:57:03,Werewing,Maybe Nibbley gotten an embiggening collar.
24-07-2020T00:57:07,Mediawatcher,"I hope so, but Tom might decide to be cruel to us"
24-07-2020T00:57:14,Zakuru,i dont mind the cruel
24-07-2020T00:57:31,Mediawatcher,"Neither do I, it really makes things tense, but it‚Äôs so nerve wracking!"
24-07-2020T00:57:35,iliar,Karen in a swimsuit of the same color twice? Potboiler!
24-07-2020T00:57:51,sodaYEET,it all come tumbling down tumbling...
24-07-2020T00:58:00,InTheLionsDen,Evals will open the umbrella to protect him and Mike. She will bounce off of it.
24-07-2020T00:58:13,Ordithus,heck of an umbrella
24-07-2020T00:58:21,Mediawatcher,And we have to wait a week to find out!
24-07-2020T00:58:22,AspiringNoodle,"Plot twist: Mrs. Nibbly dies, only to reveal that she's not really a squirrel :snail:"
24-07-2020T00:58:38,Mediawatcher,Or not depending on when he can update
24-07-2020T00:58:43,Zakuru,we already did that lol
24-07-2020T00:58:47,Xonalladro,and hes still holding the umbrella so that would mean buff evals
24-07-2020T00:59:11,Xonalladro,now i cznt get that out of my head
24-07-2020T00:59:18,Ordithus,"Karen lands on Brutus who somehow found the dungeon leads here, crushing him"
24-07-2020T00:59:42,Majyxs,Brutus opens the trap door that lead up to the beach.
24-07-2020T00:59:54,CrimsonHelsing,longer fall xP
24-07-2020T00:59:54,Zakuru,just like kronk
24-07-2020T00:59:56,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-clovisgirl_shake:*[Do not want!]
24-07-2020T01:00:02,Majyxs,Of course.
24-07-2020T01:00:05,sodaYEET,it is possible to get impale with unopened umbellar
24-07-2020T01:00:05,Mediawatcher,Oh god there‚Äôs gotta be something that can save her!
24-07-2020T01:00:07,AspiringNoodle,Now the big question
24-07-2020T01:00:12,AspiringNoodle,Does Karen land heads or tails?
24-07-2020T01:00:22,Mediawatcher,Heads probably
24-07-2020T01:00:41,InTheLionsDen,:ctwokinds-nibsdance:
24-07-2020T01:00:44,Majyxs,Cats always land on their... FACE??!
24-07-2020T01:00:48,Xonalladro,she doin a full backflip
24-07-2020T01:00:56,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-nibsdance:
24-07-2020T01:01:53,KeefMcDerpface,\o Night all. :ptv-sleepy:
24-07-2020T01:01:58,johnnytho,Night!
24-07-2020T01:02:02,Xonalladro,night keef
24-07-2020T01:02:07,sodaYEET,night!
24-07-2020T01:02:57,beastlee99,night!
24-07-2020T01:03:19,hyneria,"Mmm, question for those who have followed TK longer than I have"
24-07-2020T01:03:47,AspiringNoodle,*looks to Ord*
24-07-2020T01:03:48,Xonalladro,not me then
24-07-2020T01:03:51,Ordithus,wat
24-07-2020T01:04:00,CrimsonHelsing,that being?
24-07-2020T01:04:04,hyneria,"I've seen a few theories saying Shadow/Dark Trace is behind all of this, and not Rose. But for what I've read, Dark Trace is only inside Trace's mind?"
24-07-2020T01:04:06,beastlee99,I started in june...
24-07-2020T01:04:13,Ordithus,I am not even close to the folks who've been here
24-07-2020T01:04:32,hyneria,"and wasn't Dark Trace freaking out when Rose was ""unchained"" almost as he knew this would happen?"
24-07-2020T01:04:40,CrimsonHelsing,Doesn't mean that he didn't program the estate to do some things by itself
24-07-2020T01:04:56,CrimsonHelsing,"uh, he freaked out because he knew Rose had more chance of getting in the way"
24-07-2020T01:05:01,CrimsonHelsing,without restricitons
24-07-2020T01:05:10,hyneria,I just look at this like
24-07-2020T01:05:16,Ordithus,:eyes:
24-07-2020T01:05:29,hyneria,In none of the previous pages anything has shown that Rose is against this
24-07-2020T01:05:47,CrimsonHelsing,*sigh*
24-07-2020T01:05:50,Xonalladro,"another one to have nice trace's back, from his view maybe"
24-07-2020T01:05:57,hyneria,"So I am confused as why people think she is disabled or whatever,"
24-07-2020T01:06:12,Mediawatcher,"I‚Äôd like to believe rose wouldn‚Äôt support this, but everything seems to be pointing to her."
24-07-2020T01:06:23,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-rose: does this look like the face of a cold blooded killer
24-07-2020T01:06:32,johnnytho,yes
24-07-2020T01:06:33,Xonalladro,yes
24-07-2020T01:06:33,CrimsonHelsing,have you ever heard of restrictions that can't be removed ever even with the administrative override?
24-07-2020T01:06:35,Ordithus,haha
24-07-2020T01:06:43,Majyxs,I'm sure they said the same of Lizzy Borden.
24-07-2020T01:06:44,CrimsonHelsing,"yeah, think about that"
24-07-2020T01:06:44,orekh,dark trace had planned it all before he lost his memory. memory loss is just part of his plan
24-07-2020T01:06:52,hyneria,"It makes me think about what she told Raine. A bit like that phrase from littlefinger. ""I told you not to trust me"""
24-07-2020T01:07:07,AspiringNoodle,"Nah, if anything, Trace just prepared in case he lost his memories"
24-07-2020T01:07:21,CrimsonHelsing,okay he can not have planned that far ahead
24-07-2020T01:07:22,AspiringNoodle,Because it was one of the masks that wiped his memory
24-07-2020T01:07:29,hyneria,"Yes CrimsonHelsing, but that still doesn't explain why Rose couldn't be behind this"
24-07-2020T01:07:36,hyneria,or in league with whoever is doing it
24-07-2020T01:07:38,sodaYEET,don't trust anyone especially your relative qoute?
24-07-2020T01:07:44,Majyxs,"""I am sorry Master Trace, but I am following your explicit orders..."""
24-07-2020T01:07:55,CrimsonHelsing,"because once the trap is sprug, that initiates a total override of any previous commands"
24-07-2020T01:08:09,hyneria,But where it does show that? :P
24-07-2020T01:08:13,CrimsonHelsing,Trace wanted the process to be irreversible
24-07-2020T01:08:15,CrimsonHelsing,ugh!
24-07-2020T01:08:18,hyneria,That's my problem with that theory
24-07-2020T01:09:03,hyneria,"I mean, we saw the old, projection Rose uses the red dialogue"
24-07-2020T01:09:06,hyneria,a couple times
24-07-2020T01:09:17,CrimsonHelsing,we DON'T know that was HER
24-07-2020T01:09:19,hyneria,"the same as the ""the body is ready"""
24-07-2020T01:09:20,Mediawatcher,"Well see, but so far Everything points to rose"
24-07-2020T01:09:20,Zakuru,red = evil
24-07-2020T01:09:27,sodaYEET,do you think it's Euchre?
24-07-2020T01:09:30,beastlee99,"I agree, Red sucks"
24-07-2020T01:09:39,hyneria,"Crimson, she tells ""Yes... Master"" to Trace"
24-07-2020T01:09:47,hyneria,in that exact font and red dialog
24-07-2020T01:09:57,Twokinds,"Mike is a red fox, and thus evil."
24-07-2020T01:10:04,CrimsonHelsing,xD
24-07-2020T01:10:04,Ordithus,knew it
24-07-2020T01:10:05,sodaYEET,oh no
24-07-2020T01:10:06,beastlee99,"Wow every time a Two Steps From Hell song has played, it's been amazing"
24-07-2020T01:10:15,Mediawatcher,The hunter were there all along!
24-07-2020T01:10:15,AspiringNoodle,I knew it!
24-07-2020T01:10:21,InTheLionsDen,They are red because they were created by the devil.
24-07-2020T01:10:21,unsteddyphoenix,Nibbly is a red squirrel....
24-07-2020T01:10:23,Ordithus,"""Yes... master?"" was not in red font"
24-07-2020T01:10:24,AspiringNoodle,"There was a reason Nora ""cursed"" him :ptv-ohmy:"
24-07-2020T01:10:25,unsteddyphoenix,!!!!!!!!
24-07-2020T01:10:28,Mediawatcher,The hints were there all along!
24-07-2020T01:10:33,Majyxs,"I think Rose is just a puppet, after all, she knew Maren was there. The red text was suprised to realize she was at the estate."
24-07-2020T01:10:52,CrimsonHelsing,Hey slow down
24-07-2020T01:11:18,Xonalladro,"no, go faster"
24-07-2020T01:11:27,Ordithus,"When we definitely know it is Rose speaking, the font is green"
24-07-2020T01:11:30,hyneria,Meh I still think everything points to Rose being involved
24-07-2020T01:11:44,hyneria,and nothing to shadow's inner shadow doing it
24-07-2020T01:11:52,CrimsonHelsing,this may very well be a copy of old Trace's consciousness meant to control the process and the trap
24-07-2020T01:11:58,hyneria,I think there's something else there
24-07-2020T01:12:07,Majyxs,The vines hanging down are an apporiate metaphor.
24-07-2020T01:12:16,CrimsonHelsing,the red text in the last page was clearly evil trace
24-07-2020T01:12:21,hyneria,But is not the same Dark Trace that tried to make Trace think Flora cheated on him
24-07-2020T01:12:34,CrimsonHelsing,it actually is
24-07-2020T01:12:38,Werewing,"Man, I hit resume on Tom's stream. He has come far in just a few hours."
24-07-2020T01:12:39,hyneria,"Evil Trace is only within Trace's mind, though?"
24-07-2020T01:12:52,CrimsonHelsing,"yes, doesn't mean he wasn't saying that last line"
24-07-2020T01:12:56,hyneria,"and has always used a creepy font, not the one from last page"
24-07-2020T01:12:58,Xonalladro,and it has the weird font too
24-07-2020T01:13:11,CrimsonHelsing,"uhh, Tom updated that to make him more creepy?"
24-07-2020T01:13:52,Mediawatcher,"No doubt in my mind that rose is causing this, but we‚Äôll see if I‚Äôm wrong"
24-07-2020T01:13:55,hyneria,"Also, we see that same red font talking about finally seeing maren"
24-07-2020T01:14:01,hyneria,Dark Trace knows who Maren is
24-07-2020T01:14:16,hyneria,so it makes no sense to be surprised
24-07-2020T01:14:23,Mediawatcher,I am kind of confused as to why rose saved Karen and Madelyn earlier
24-07-2020T01:14:37,Mediawatcher,If she‚Äôs trying to kill them here
24-07-2020T01:14:45,Xonalladro,but was surprised when he found out she was there at the estate
24-07-2020T01:14:57,hyneria,I think is because previously she just didn't remembered
24-07-2020T01:15:07,AspiringNoodle,Rose might not be completely behind everything
24-07-2020T01:15:13,Xonalladro,doesnt it all tie in with saria too?
24-07-2020T01:15:18,AspiringNoodle,There was an oddly Trace-shaped shadow in the Rose Garden
24-07-2020T01:15:32,AspiringNoodle,With some exposed ribs... but I digress
24-07-2020T01:15:52,hyneria,The shadow behind trace in the last page
24-07-2020T01:15:57,sodaYEET,the templar council might want old Trace back and thus rigged the place?
24-07-2020T01:16:02,hyneria,I think it is whoever this red haired person is
24-07-2020T01:16:03,hyneria,http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/1099/
24-07-2020T01:16:26,AspiringNoodle,I think that might be Trace's dark side
24-07-2020T01:16:30,hyneria,And that is not Dark Trace
24-07-2020T01:16:39,hyneria,Dark Trace doesn't even have a body
24-07-2020T01:16:55,hyneria,and whoever this is was freed when Rose's restrictions were removed
24-07-2020T01:16:57,sodaYEET,It's Red!
24-07-2020T01:16:59,Ordithus,Trace did some messed up stuff
24-07-2020T01:17:08,hyneria,Maddie even sees him
24-07-2020T01:17:18,hyneria,and the floating rose petals behind
24-07-2020T01:17:39,SageSaga,.  .  . Dark Trace totally has a body
24-07-2020T01:17:42,SageSaga,its Trace
24-07-2020T01:17:53,Xonalladro,but with black hair
24-07-2020T01:17:55,hyneria,"so both undead Rose and whoever this is were locked there, and Stoney was supposed to guard it"
24-07-2020T01:17:59,SageSaga,-_-
24-07-2020T01:18:05,Zakuru,red hair'd trace is trace 2.0?
24-07-2020T01:18:06,hyneria,"Yes, Sage is right :P"
24-07-2020T01:18:19,SageSaga,do yall really think Traces old memories are just wandering around outside of his body?
24-07-2020T01:18:37,hyneria,"People seems to think that, Sage"
24-07-2020T01:18:40,PopularDollars,the fact that he gets the selection for the hair shading so right on the first try is so impressive
24-07-2020T01:18:50,hyneria,I was under the impression Dark Trace was just in Trace's head
24-07-2020T01:19:34,Zakuru,"i mean, if trace was trying to bring ppl back to life, he could at LEAST make a copy of himself before ms. mask came and wiped his brain"
24-07-2020T01:19:36,Mediawatcher,"Probably not sage, rosebe causing this"
24-07-2020T01:19:39,hyneria,Now I wonder if that's a human version of Rose
24-07-2020T01:19:41,hyneria,red hair
24-07-2020T01:19:43,Mediawatcher,Rose is causing this
24-07-2020T01:19:46,hyneria,can live much longer
24-07-2020T01:19:46,AspiringNoodle,What Zak said
24-07-2020T01:19:53,AspiringNoodle,Trace has messed with some stupidly dark magic
24-07-2020T01:20:12,hyneria,so technically that would be a third Trace
24-07-2020T01:20:23,Zakuru,"however, im totally fine with trace hallucinating dark trace since he's in a very triggering room"
24-07-2020T01:20:30,Xonalladro,traceception
24-07-2020T01:20:34,Dadrobit,Back for a bit.
24-07-2020T01:20:35,Ordithus,":eyes: triangle panels, this page gonna have action"
24-07-2020T01:20:38,AspiringNoodle,That is also a viable explanation
24-07-2020T01:20:39,hyneria,"Zakuru, Maddie saw whoever that is"
24-07-2020T01:20:42,Ordithus,wb forabit
24-07-2020T01:20:59,SageSaga,if Trace could just clone himself- why didnt he just clone his wife?
24-07-2020T01:21:12,hyneria,http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/1054/
24-07-2020T01:21:16,hyneria,Here
24-07-2020T01:21:21,Zakuru,im just spitballing here~
24-07-2020T01:21:24,AspiringNoodle,Cuz she ded :snail:
24-07-2020T01:21:34,hyneria,so it is a separate individual
24-07-2020T01:21:39,Dadrobit,"Huh, I wonder if since the magics within the manor are all fucky now, I wonder if Maddie suddenly remembers what she saw in the room?"
24-07-2020T01:21:39,Majyxs,"Transplanting brains is easier. Hell, even Steve Martin could do it!"
24-07-2020T01:21:55,AspiringNoodle,We don't know when he did it.  Maybe it took him a lot of research to get that far.  Or he needs a live subject to do it properly
24-07-2020T01:22:14,Xonalladro,he started messing with dark magic after she died tho
24-07-2020T01:22:18,SageSaga,you can make a clone of something without it being alive of course
24-07-2020T01:22:31,hyneria,homunculus?
24-07-2020T01:22:40,sodaYEET,or maybe that didn't work and require Maren body?
24-07-2020T01:22:42,Majyxs,Take your dead wife to the pet semetary.
24-07-2020T01:22:44,AspiringNoodle,"A physical clone, yes, but what of the mind?"
24-07-2020T01:22:58,Mediawatcher,I wonder who rose was talking to in the last chapter then.
24-07-2020T01:23:16,SageSaga,=_= yall are bad at creating coherent stories
24-07-2020T01:23:24,Xonalladro,ik
24-07-2020T01:23:25,CrimsonHelsing,tell me about it
24-07-2020T01:23:25,hyneria,"and why would that clone be locked up with the real rose, and why would Dark Trace be like NO! about freeing him?"
24-07-2020T01:23:35,hyneria,or her
24-07-2020T01:23:47,Mediawatcher,"Well lol we can do is speculate, we don‚Äôt know the full story yet"
24-07-2020T01:24:00,Ordithus,"that was to lifting restrictions off Rose, a separate event to the whole shenanigans going down now"
24-07-2020T01:24:05,Mediawatcher,All we can do is speculate
24-07-2020T01:24:07,SageSaga,yeah but you can speculate better =_=
24-07-2020T01:24:20,Dadrobit,Be smart damn it!
24-07-2020T01:24:22,Zakuru,doth sage have spoilers?
24-07-2020T01:24:22,Mediawatcher,Well I speculate rose is behind this
24-07-2020T01:24:29,hyneria,But wouldn't Dark Trace know what was locked in the garden?
24-07-2020T01:24:31,Ordithus,I'm pretty sure the real villain is Lynn
24-07-2020T01:24:37,Ordithus,It's so obvious
24-07-2020T01:24:41,SageSaga,"its like ""Karen starts falling"" ""Gasp! Trace will catch her!"" ""Trace isnt there-"" ""Yeah but he'll like- sense it!"""
24-07-2020T01:24:48,sodaYEET,I never pay so much attention to each page before
24-07-2020T01:25:07,hyneria,"Heck, Maybe Evil Trace figured he had gone too far and locked whatever he made in the garden"
24-07-2020T01:25:16,Dadrobit,Rose is 100% behind this. She was an asshole even before Trace got to her. Now add in some revenge over his torture? Ezpz
24-07-2020T01:25:34,AspiringNoodle,That is the most likely scenario
24-07-2020T01:25:35,Mediawatcher,That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm thinking
24-07-2020T01:25:36,SageSaga,Dadrobit- Rose only cares about one person
24-07-2020T01:25:39,SageSaga,its not Trace
24-07-2020T01:25:41,Dadrobit,Rose
24-07-2020T01:25:44,Mediawatcher,Saria
24-07-2020T01:26:02,Majyxs,"Oh man, Rose wants to make sure Saria is resurrected."
24-07-2020T01:26:06,hyneria,I think it makes sense Rose would want to bring back Saria
24-07-2020T01:26:07,SageSaga,im too busy facepalming over Dadrobits comment
24-07-2020T01:26:19,Mediawatcher,And she‚Äôs gonna do everything in her power to make sure saria is brought back
24-07-2020T01:26:20,Dadrobit,:D Be smart damn it!
24-07-2020T01:26:36,Zakuru,would Rose have enough morality and foresight to know it is wrong and that maybe Saria wouldn't want this?
24-07-2020T01:26:38,Majyxs,And so is Dark Trace for that matter.
24-07-2020T01:26:49,unsteddyphoenix,I think rose cares about trace a lot...like cares whether he keeps.living
24-07-2020T01:27:06,hyneria,Dark Trace is kind of useless tho. Good Trace has control of his body
24-07-2020T01:27:09,Mediawatcher,Don‚Äôt you already know what‚Äôs gonna happen sage?
24-07-2020T01:27:18,hyneria,so all he can do is try to make Good Trace snap
24-07-2020T01:27:31,sodaYEET,I guess see y'all in 2022 when this chapter is finished
24-07-2020T01:27:33,SageSaga,"yeah- imagine you just got access to all the secrets of the house- and you saw ""Project bring Saria back to life"" - the only person you ever cared about- and it says ""But we need Maren-"" Rose would be like- Oh heeeeeeeck yes- bye bye Maren-"
24-07-2020T01:27:34,Dadrobit,"It's complicated. On the one hand, dead Trace would be nice, but on the other, she knows Saria would probably not like that very much."
24-07-2020T01:27:56,CrimsonHelsing,"But Rose knows the Trace that's there is a different man, and she wouldn't want to hurt him, that would just bring the monster that started all this right back"
24-07-2020T01:28:02,AspiringNoodle,I'm still trying to figure out what that shadow was
24-07-2020T01:28:04,SageSaga,no i dont know everything thats gonna happen
24-07-2020T01:28:12,Mediawatcher,"Oh ok, sorry for claiming that"
24-07-2020T01:28:14,hyneria,"What makes you say that, Crimson?"
24-07-2020T01:28:21,SageSaga,but ive also been writing stories for as long as Tom
24-07-2020T01:28:27,CrimsonHelsing,"please, use your head"
24-07-2020T01:28:32,hyneria,Rose is technically a monster too already
24-07-2020T01:28:40,SageSaga,I do know some things but they arent leading me to these conclusions
24-07-2020T01:28:42,hyneria,She is undead
24-07-2020T01:28:47,Mediawatcher,I want to be optimistic about rose but reality is setting in
24-07-2020T01:28:49,hyneria,and part plant
24-07-2020T01:28:56,sodaYEET,this chat is the 2nd most tiring thing to think about after Neon Genesis Evangelion
24-07-2020T01:29:10,SageSaga,Rose can still be a good person- and want to sacrifice someone else for the person she loves
24-07-2020T01:29:15,unsteddyphoenix,Eh not bad
24-07-2020T01:29:24,hyneria,"I'm using my head Crimson, and nothing makes me think Rose would think what you are saying"
24-07-2020T01:29:32,SageSaga,almost all of us would allow someone else to die for someone we know and love
24-07-2020T01:29:44,hyneria,Yes
24-07-2020T01:29:46,Mediawatcher,"Maybe she is still a good person, I hope she is but at the same time logic heavily suggests otherwise"
24-07-2020T01:29:49,Xonalladro,true
24-07-2020T01:29:57,Ordithus,yeah but Maren is best girl so even Rose would stop short of that
24-07-2020T01:30:05,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-eyeroll:
24-07-2020T01:30:18,Dadrobit,Funny way to spell Raine there ord
24-07-2020T01:30:18,sodaYEET,I really hope that's the case Ord
24-07-2020T01:30:18,hyneria,Rose doesn't even have a future
24-07-2020T01:30:23,Mediawatcher,"Dang maren is about be turned into saria and she‚Äôs gonna lose her sister, adding insult to injury"
24-07-2020T01:30:37,hyneria,She either stays as an undead half plant abomination or is allowed to die
24-07-2020T01:30:54,hyneria,so whe would have nothing to lose to bring Saria back
24-07-2020T01:31:39,Twokinds,Done
24-07-2020T01:31:45,Zakuru,you did it!
24-07-2020T01:31:46,SageSaga,great job Tom

24-07-2020T01:31:58,hyneria,I know is a silly thing to focus on
24-07-2020T01:32:00,Xonalladro,noice
24-07-2020T01:32:04,Mediawatcher,"Great job tom, and I can‚Äôt wait for the next page!"
24-07-2020T01:32:09,hyneria,But those fire effects are sooo good
24-07-2020T01:32:10,Majyxs,Excellent.

24-07-2020T01:32:41,Xonalladro,"that would be my que to head out, see yall later!"
24-07-2020T01:32:42,hyneria,I just noticed
24-07-2020T01:32:49,hyneria,The rose petals around fake Maren
24-07-2020T01:32:52,Mediawatcher,Great stream tom!
24-07-2020T01:32:56,hyneria,as she vanishes
24-07-2020T01:32:58,AspiringNoodle,"Ultimately, can't wait to find out how much a role Rose is playing in these events"
24-07-2020T01:33:04,CrimsonHelsing,"Agreed, great job Tom. I look forward to the dialogue as always, and the next page after this"
24-07-2020T01:33:04,Xonalladro,bye tom
24-07-2020T01:33:10,Mediawatcher,It‚Äôs gonna be exciting!

24-07-2020T01:34:46,Ordithus,I am curious how all these threads will tie together
24-07-2020T01:34:51,InTheLionsDen,Imperial Margarine.
24-07-2020T01:34:58,Dadrobit,Granny knot probably
24-07-2020T01:35:03,Ordithus,the worst knot
24-07-2020T01:35:11,sodaYEET,that's one less loose end to worry about -Shepard
24-07-2020T01:35:22,TheSexyBeast,Cloverhitch
24-07-2020T01:35:35,Dadrobit,Clovis-hitch
24-07-2020T01:35:44,TheSexyBeast,Better
24-07-2020T01:36:20,Ordithus,"bite him, Callum.  It's unexpected"
24-07-2020T01:37:57,hyneria,"Sage, since you like Isekai, have you seen one called Redo of a Healer? it is getting an anime"
24-07-2020T01:38:07,hyneria,supposedly it is very controversial
24-07-2020T01:38:17,SageSaga,:fleur-de-lis:Redo of a Healer?
24-07-2020T01:38:23,Dadrobit,Be back in A bit again...

24-07-2020T01:38:55,hyneria,really long title
24-07-2020T01:39:10,AspiringNoodle,Only in Japan: Paragraph = title :snail:
24-07-2020T01:39:20,ZRO4825,Light Novels for ya
24-07-2020T01:39:37,AspiringNoodle,I remember watching the world's cringiest anime out of pure fascination for the train wreck
24-07-2020T01:39:53,SageSaga,not familiar with it
24-07-2020T01:39:55,AspiringNoodle,"Short-hand, it's known as Watamote"
24-07-2020T01:40:16,hyneria,It is about a Healer who is mistreated by everyone so he restarts and just takes vengance on everyone
24-07-2020T01:40:24,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-shock:
24-07-2020T01:40:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom haz crown
24-07-2020T01:40:30,hyneria,and supposedy gets really dark
24-07-2020T01:40:32,AspiringNoodle,Did he reverse uno card his skills?
24-07-2020T01:41:29,hyneria,well I must be going. Good night everyone
24-07-2020T01:41:40,Ordithus,night hyneria

24-07-2020T01:42:50,MatyMaty,"Oh boy, Redo of Healer, huh?"
24-07-2020T01:42:55,SageSaga,always night owl- cant sleep
24-07-2020T01:43:04,SageSaga,yeah im not familiar with it
24-07-2020T01:43:09,MatyMaty,Well is like
24-07-2020T01:43:19,MatyMaty,Think of the Shield Hero
24-07-2020T01:43:47,SageSaga,but more twisted?
24-07-2020T01:43:56,MatyMaty,if the Shield Hero had decided screw everyone and became Demiurge from Overlord
24-07-2020T01:44:08,MatyMaty,that level of twisted/evil
24-07-2020T01:44:10,SageSaga,oof
24-07-2020T01:44:18,SageSaga,not sure i wanna watch that
24-07-2020T01:44:49,MatyMaty,Did you saw what happened in the latest Overlord novel? :P
24-07-2020T01:45:07,SageSaga,havent started the novels yet
24-07-2020T01:45:23,SageSaga,"still going through ""Im not a pedo buuuuut-"""
24-07-2020T01:45:26,MatyMaty,"if you disliked Ainz, you will hate him now"
24-07-2020T01:46:03,SageSaga,that title was a joke because the MC is constantly reminding the reader hes not into younger girls
24-07-2020T01:46:31,SageSaga,he finally really fell for a girl too but shes like a million years old so i guess he wasnt kidding
24-07-2020T01:47:17,Ordithus,does she look like she's a million years old
24-07-2020T01:47:20,SageSaga,and I already hate Ainz- he chose his path a while ago
24-07-2020T01:47:37,MatyMaty,Want spoilers?
24-07-2020T01:47:40,SageSaga,she looks like an actual adult
24-07-2020T01:48:07,SageSaga,you can whisper em to me- dont know if people in chat want em
24-07-2020T01:48:09,Ordithus,phew
24-07-2020T01:48:33,sunblaze,hi everyone
24-07-2020T01:48:43,SageSaga,yo Sunblaze!

24-07-2020T01:50:00,AspiringNoodle,Ima head out for the night.  Brain is fried from multitasking for like... 10+ hours?
24-07-2020T01:50:02,MatyMaty,"mmmmm. There's also ""Did You Know That A Playboy Can Change His Job To A Sage?"" That one is pretty fun"
24-07-2020T01:50:08,MatyMaty,"You might like it, Sage"
24-07-2020T01:50:10,Ordithus,night noodle
24-07-2020T01:50:56,AspiringNoodle,I hope in the future to be able to catch Sage's Saturday streams...
24-07-2020T01:51:00,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-sleepy:
24-07-2020T01:51:15,sunblaze,hmmm I like that song. what anime was it from? :D
24-07-2020T01:51:27,SageSaga,"im gonna finish Death March Rhapsody then read Ive been reincarnated as an S Class Monster- a behemoth, but ive been mistaken for a kitten and now im an elf girls pet"
24-07-2020T01:51:54,MatyMaty,XD
24-07-2020T01:51:55,Ordithus,could be worse :csagesaga-kaylinheart:
24-07-2020T01:52:00,MatyMaty,I love those titles
24-07-2020T01:52:00,sunblaze,indeed :P
24-07-2020T01:52:06,SageSaga,then- lets see-
24-07-2020T01:52:14,SageSaga,what after that- let me pull up my list
24-07-2020T01:53:00,SageSaga,I'm in Love with the Villainess comes out in September
24-07-2020T01:53:27,SageSaga,the next Ascendance of a Bookworm comes out in August
24-07-2020T01:53:56,SageSaga,"The Alchemist Who Survived Now Dreams of a Quiet City Life, Vol. 4 is in September-"
24-07-2020T01:54:11,MatyMaty,so many isekai
24-07-2020T01:54:13,MatyMaty,whew
24-07-2020T01:54:34,SageSaga,"So I'm a Spider, So What?, Vol. 9 August!"
24-07-2020T01:54:37,MatyMaty,...and all sound/are more fun than .Hack :v
24-07-2020T01:55:17,SageSaga,Reincarnated as a Sword (Light Novel) Vol. 7 isnt announced yet T_T
24-07-2020T01:56:27,SageSaga,that one you recommended for me isnt on Kindle
24-07-2020T01:56:38,MatyMaty,"oh, that MC is cute"
24-07-2020T01:56:46,MatyMaty,the one from Reincarnated as a Sword
24-07-2020T01:57:01,SageSaga,the sword is the MC! XD
24-07-2020T01:57:24,SageSaga,Fran is just his cute wielder :P
24-07-2020T01:57:29,MatyMaty,then whos' the catgirl? XD
24-07-2020T01:57:37,MatyMaty,ooh
24-07-2020T01:57:51,SageSaga,shes actually kinda sadistic - it bothers me
24-07-2020T01:58:26,SageSaga,"the author bothers me with his penchant for ""hmm- how do i keep this going- oh i know- torture- ok Fran- torture someone for plot advancement"""
24-07-2020T01:58:37,MatyMaty,yikes
24-07-2020T01:59:19,SageSaga,"so the catgirl goes off and finds ""bad people"" chops off their legs and heals them - repeats till they tell her everything- and then turns them in to the guard"
24-07-2020T01:59:46,MatyMaty,:no_mouth:
24-07-2020T02:00:03,MatyMaty,I'd say that goes beyond sadistic :P
24-07-2020T02:00:06,SageSaga,"im just like ""you know- you could actually write a plot that involves learning without torture-"""
24-07-2020T02:00:37,SageSaga,only reason i keep reading is because while that stuff seems to always happen- it doesnt happen often enough and everything else is interesting
24-07-2020T02:00:49,MatyMaty,There seems to be an influx of more... darker themed Isekai and fantasy stuff
24-07-2020T02:01:03,SageSaga,see its weird because its mostly not dark T_T
24-07-2020T02:01:33,SageSaga,"it only gets dark when shes torturing ""bad guys"" like the author thinks torture is ok and works even though it - well isnt and doesnt"
24-07-2020T02:01:48,sunblaze,"it is also a legit way in many RPG's to handle questioning. especially in evil groups. talk or I kill you, ressurect you and kill you again!"
24-07-2020T02:02:11,MatyMaty,"Redo of Healer is kinda like. Very over the top stuff, but he only harms people who were jerks to him. He actually saves a wolf kemonomimi village that his party destroyed on his last life"
24-07-2020T02:03:17,SageSaga,The problem is its better to show how realistic interrogations work
24-07-2020T02:04:12,MatyMaty,"But then he turns the captain of the knights into a girl, all of his knights into beasts and tells him like ""They can only think of two things now. Feeding and mating. You can let them eat you, or keep them busy until the spell runs out on a few days"""
24-07-2020T02:04:19,MatyMaty,and he just leaves them there
24-07-2020T02:04:58,MatyMaty,so I'm reaaally wondering how they are gonna adapt that to an anime :P
24-07-2020T02:04:58,SageSaga,yeah thats messed up
24-07-2020T02:05:56,SageSaga,"i really prefer realistic interrogations- offering ways out of crime- or saying ""Look- your in the slave trade- theres no helping you- but- i can see to it that your wife and kid are taken care of- just give me the information"""
24-07-2020T02:06:27,MatyMaty,that would be a fun fantasy story
24-07-2020T02:06:36,MatyMaty,city guard solving crime in a realistic way
24-07-2020T02:06:40,SageSaga,most criminals are criminals for a reason -they arent just evil
24-07-2020T02:06:41,Ordithus,[I'll make sure you get a proper burial]*:csagesaga-nynasmirk:
24-07-2020T02:06:46,sunblaze,^
24-07-2020T02:07:06,DarthRexKing,Was this song used in Bleach or no?
24-07-2020T02:07:32,SageSaga,"""Look- maybe we take you in- maybe we forget we left the backdoor open- maybe your kid is in a wagon stocked with food and supplies- just tell me where your boss is hiding the girls"""
24-07-2020T02:08:35,SageSaga,this song was used in ERASED
24-07-2020T02:08:39,SageSaga,fantastic anime
24-07-2020T02:08:44,MatyMaty,"wow, 2 am"
24-07-2020T02:08:44,DarthRexKing,Oh. .w. Okay.
24-07-2020T02:08:48,SageSaga,but this band i think has done one
24-07-2020T02:08:49,MatyMaty,I better sleep
24-07-2020T02:09:05,DarthRexKing,o3o okay.
24-07-2020T02:09:07,Ordithus,night maty
24-07-2020T02:09:48,MatyMaty,Nite nitee everyone!
24-07-2020T02:09:54,SageSaga,gnight!
24-07-2020T02:12:24,ZRO4825,G'night Maty~
24-07-2020T02:16:19,SageSaga,wow
24-07-2020T02:16:30,SageSaga,i looked to see if Redo of Healer was on Kindle-
24-07-2020T02:17:07,SageSaga,and all they have is a bunch of Notebooks with the artwork on the cover and im like - what school is gonna be ok with THAT
24-07-2020T02:17:37,ZRO4825,lol
24-07-2020T02:20:20,Ordithus,you know what is effective and unexpected: a cat being tossed at you.  Claws. Teeth.
24-07-2020T02:20:26,Ordithus,How far can Kaylin toss Nyna?
24-07-2020T02:22:03,SageSaga,hmm- Depends on if shes just tossing her or if Nyna is kicking off at the same time- Kaylin has Fortification enchantments so she can steel herself against blowbacks- so she can kinda break RL physics with that
24-07-2020T02:22:27,SageSaga,if shes just throwing her- she can probably throw her 30-50 feet or so
24-07-2020T02:22:34,Ordithus,impressive
24-07-2020T02:22:39,SageSaga,if Nyna is kicking off could probably double that
24-07-2020T02:22:55,Ordithus,okay you have to make this happen sometime haha
24-07-2020T02:23:54,SageSaga,Kaylin has proven she sucks with a Bow- but she can throw things XD
24-07-2020T02:26:04,SageSaga,give kaylin a haste potion and a table covered in throwing knives- and you'll think a hwacha is firing knives
24-07-2020T02:29:14,Ordithus,oh yeah she asploded that dude's head with a rock
24-07-2020T02:30:56,SageSaga,her strength seems absurdly high but its really not- its like less than half that of a fighter of her level
24-07-2020T02:32:02,SageSaga,her precision and speed makes her very deadly though- rogue after all
24-07-2020T02:32:52,SageSaga,as i mentioned a few weeks ago- Magic is really powerful- but while mages have incredibly high power/damage potential- their maneuverability relies on very specific spell like abilities
24-07-2020T02:33:17,SageSaga,meanwhile Rogues and Fighters have crazy options when it comes to being mobile
24-07-2020T02:33:37,SageSaga,the main defense against magic is not getting hit
24-07-2020T02:33:59,SageSaga,Magics rapid casting and AOEs makes that not easy though
24-07-2020T02:35:52,Ordithus,kill em before they even know you're there
24-07-2020T02:36:17,sunblaze,indeed every mages eternal foe.
24-07-2020T02:36:24,sunblaze,perception fail!
24-07-2020T02:36:41,Ordithus,not having mage armor up at all times
24-07-2020T02:38:26,SageSaga,the counter is - Magic is super tricky too
24-07-2020T02:38:32,SageSaga,Contingency stacking is huuuuge
24-07-2020T02:40:13,SageSaga,"""If you hit me with poison damage- a magical barrier is formed and cures the poison status, if you drop me to 10% i teleport 100ft away and gain regen, if an invisible foe gets within 120 feet of me I auto cast detect invisible-"""
24-07-2020T02:41:40,Ordithus,the barbarian counter to that strategy is to punch harder and more
24-07-2020T02:41:54,SageSaga,theres a counter to that
24-07-2020T02:42:06,SageSaga,but its gonna happen in a few weeks so XD
24-07-2020T02:47:51,SageSaga,whew- sketch done-
24-07-2020T02:47:56,SageSaga,i think it looks- pretty good-
24-07-2020T02:48:07,Ordithus,\o/
24-07-2020T02:48:11,SageSaga,i like this panel of Callum-
24-07-2020T02:48:22,SageSaga,he looks kinda cool here-
24-07-2020T02:48:37,Ordithus,miniature badass
24-07-2020T02:49:02,SageSaga,i need water though- ran out about 20 minutes ago- picking up an empty water bottle over and over now-
24-07-2020T02:49:16,Ordithus,imma get some sleep
24-07-2020T02:49:24,Ordithus,night :ctwokinds-RainezZz:
24-07-2020T02:49:32,sunblaze,take care
24-07-2020T02:49:34,MarvTheHugPharaoh,nighty night Ord
24-07-2020T02:53:19,SageSaga,aww- gnight Ord XD
24-07-2020T02:53:43,SageSaga,while i got water i noticed that my mother got Strawberries- that can mean only 1 of 3 things-
24-07-2020T02:54:12,SageSaga,"1 - Shes gonna eat em. 2 - Shes gonna make Strawberry Shortcake, or 3 - Strawberry pieeeeeee"
24-07-2020T02:55:02,DarthRexKing,I am heading out too.
24-07-2020T02:55:11,SageSaga,i shouldnt have the shortcake or pie- but i will XD
24-07-2020T02:55:16,SageSaga,gnight Darth!
24-07-2020T02:55:38,ZRO4825,lol Sage
24-07-2020T02:55:56,ZRO4825,"I know the feeling. I see certain foods that i'm like ""....I will regret life if I eat that...I am totally gonna eat that."""
24-07-2020T02:56:50,SageSaga,i wont regret it - it probably wont even affect me all that much- i can have some sugars once every week or two
24-07-2020T02:57:02,DarthRexKing,o/
24-07-2020T02:58:11,DarthRexKing,Always rocking Japanese jams. >W<
24-07-2020T02:58:14,DarthRexKing,Rock on Saga!
24-07-2020T03:14:19,Twokinds,:cake:
24-07-2020T03:14:46,Twokinds,I'm off sugar but I'll be making an exception for my b-day in a few days.
24-07-2020T03:16:41,SageSaga,XD
24-07-2020T03:17:07,SageSaga,ice cream cake?
24-07-2020T03:17:13,iliar,"I don‚Äôt understand how you did it. The doctor also recommended me to off sugar. I tried to follow the suggested diet, but able to endure just for a few months."
24-07-2020T03:17:32,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Happy early birthday Tom
24-07-2020T03:17:50,Twokinds,I could only go a few months last year too. I only just got back on it.
24-07-2020T03:17:57,Twokinds,It's hard.
24-07-2020T03:18:10,SageSaga,it can be hard to avoid lots of sugar because we put it in so much
24-07-2020T03:18:40,SageSaga,but if ya just drink water and eat low carb mostly meats and salads you can avoid most of it
24-07-2020T03:18:48,Twokinds,"I'm cooking a lot of bacon and eggs. Which, if you ask some people, bacon's bad for you too, but... I can only do so much."
24-07-2020T03:19:04,SageSaga,and a little bit is ok- like a little bit of sugar in a BBQ sauce or a salad dressing isnt a big deal
24-07-2020T03:20:13,iliar,"She wrote me a long list of things I shouldn't eat. If I followed this diet, then I was allowed to eat only rice and buckwheat porridge."
24-07-2020T03:20:13,SageSaga,"but like- treat snacks like cookies, cakes, ice cream- stuff like that as a once a couple of weeks thing and its fine so long as its in moderation"
24-07-2020T03:20:18,iliar,"I love buckwheat porridge. I usually like buckwheat porridge. But after a few weeks of this diet, I hated her."
24-07-2020T03:20:34,SageSaga,"none of that ""Im gonna eat this half gallon thing of ice cream tonight for my day off!"""
24-07-2020T03:21:08,SageSaga,im one of those weird people that can generally eat the same thing over and over and be fine with it
24-07-2020T03:22:30,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nighty night y'all <3
24-07-2020T03:22:56,SageSaga,gnight Marv! oh wait-
24-07-2020T03:22:58,SageSaga,dont go yet-
24-07-2020T03:23:17,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Yo?
24-07-2020T03:23:34,SageSaga,I forgot who did it but i thought it was you- did you have the link to that old clip of Tom naruto running in Satisfactory?
24-07-2020T03:23:47,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I do have it
24-07-2020T03:24:06,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Here it is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20aRZLX6m6I
24-07-2020T03:24:14,SageSaga,thanks! sleep well!
24-07-2020T03:24:20,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Sure thing Nighty night
24-07-2020T03:25:20,iliar,"Usually I also have no problem if the food is the same. However, there is a limit. When you eat the same thing for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Day after day, week after week."
24-07-2020T03:25:27,iliar,"And you are not allowed to ""improve"" food using salt, sugar and spices. It is very difficult. I need to find a diet that is not as difficult, but also works."
24-07-2020T03:26:13,Twokinds,I can't do without spice. Hot sauce is my friend.
24-07-2020T03:26:15,SageSaga,uhhh- im not familiar with diets that force you to have no spices at all-
24-07-2020T03:26:33,SageSaga,i get cutting certain sauces and stuff like super sugary ones or ones with too much sodium
24-07-2020T03:26:40,SageSaga,but you need some salt in your diet
24-07-2020T03:27:06,Twokinds,"I'm not being as strict this time, in hopes I can stick with it. Nothing specifically bed or sugar, like candy or donuts, but I'm okay with a little."
24-07-2020T03:27:09,Twokinds,Like bbq sauce
24-07-2020T03:27:23,Twokinds,bed=bread* I need bed
24-07-2020T03:28:03,SageSaga,you should sleep- we got a lot to do in the game tomorrow- i say that and we will probably do nothing as Silver needs to sleep for a couple days XD
24-07-2020T03:30:04,Twokinds,Yeah gunna sleep
24-07-2020T03:30:08,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
24-07-2020T03:30:34,SageSaga,sleep well man!
24-07-2020T03:31:54,iliar,It was always interesting for me to taste the real American BBQ sauce. I think it should be delicious. But those sauces that are sold in our stores are usually terrible.
24-07-2020T03:32:30,SageSaga,there are hundreds if not thousands of BBQ sauces
24-07-2020T03:32:36,iliar,"Their taste is similar ... well, imagine that you washed the grill with gasoline. And then this gasoline was rushed with starch for consistency. Bitter burnt taste with an petrol odor."
24-07-2020T03:33:02,SageSaga,almost sounds like you are using liquid smoke- that is not a sauce XD
24-07-2020T03:34:39,iliar,The problem is that BBQ sauce makers in our country are very fond of using liquid smoke. A lot of liquid smoke. Very cheap liquid smoke.
24-07-2020T03:35:11,SageSaga,=_= liquid smoke should go into something that is cooking- not in the sauce
24-07-2020T03:35:20,SageSaga,in a marinade maybe-
24-07-2020T03:35:45,SageSaga,but then you would cook it with the sauce/marinade applied to it and it would cook off
24-07-2020T03:42:51,RimaDraws,i'm back. ugh i dozed off
24-07-2020T03:43:30,SageSaga,im almost done so you can go back to sleep soon :P
24-07-2020T03:43:49,RimaDraws,nah i probably cant
24-07-2020T03:47:30,SageSaga,done!

24-07-2020T23:34:43,CrRAR,:ccrrar-chickcr: it's torque!
24-07-2020T23:34:51,CrRAR,hi torque!
24-07-2020T23:34:56,TorqueEmUp,Heya
24-07-2020T23:35:24,Ordithus,o/
24-07-2020T23:35:27,CrRAR,"yeah, Breyers has gone to crap"
24-07-2020T23:35:40,CrRAR,it tastels like soap
24-07-2020T23:35:58,CrRAR,which is funny because I think unilever owns em
24-07-2020T23:36:16,CrRAR,...which primarily makes bathroom and soap products
24-07-2020T23:36:27,TorqueEmUp,There is like so few good peanut butter cup options.
24-07-2020T23:36:55,TorqueEmUp,"It's either loaded up heavily on chocolate, or fudge, or some extra shit that makes it too sweet."
24-07-2020T23:37:04,CrRAR,that's an godly ice cream
24-07-2020T23:37:19,CrRAR,yeah some do peanut butter ice cream with the cups
24-07-2020T23:37:24,AspiringNoodle,You can get wasabi ice cream in japan
24-07-2020T23:37:33,CrRAR,but that breaks the flavor contrast
24-07-2020T23:37:36,CrRAR,I feel
24-07-2020T23:37:43,CrRAR,gotta be vanilla base
24-07-2020T23:38:04,CrRAR,good vanilla
24-07-2020T23:38:18,TorqueEmUp,"I just like Ice Cream with Peanut Butter cups, and only one I've found is ben and jerry's"
24-07-2020T23:38:49,CrRAR,"yeah, that's basically what I've resorted to too"
24-07-2020T23:38:55,CrRAR,Cherry Garcia yis
24-07-2020T23:39:15,CrRAR,I think... chubby hubby has peanut butter cups?
24-07-2020T23:39:23,TorqueEmUp,Never seen that brand here.
24-07-2020T23:39:27,CrRAR,or pretzels?
24-07-2020T23:39:40,CrRAR,I know one has pretzels and it's amazing
24-07-2020T23:39:51,TorqueEmUp,Unless Chubby hubby is one of those goofy Ben and Jerry flavor names.
24-07-2020T23:40:10,CrRAR,yeah B&Js
24-07-2020T23:40:34,SpazztasticKiwi,boy did I think something different than ice cream
24-07-2020T23:40:39,TorqueEmUp,"ahh, most B&J flavors I ignore, because they look too loaded down with stuff."
24-07-2020T23:40:42,CrRAR,xD
24-07-2020T23:40:51,SpazztasticKiwi,chubby hubby
24-07-2020T23:40:55,CrRAR,"yeah ""Vanilla Malt Ice Cream with Peanutty Fudge-Covered Pretzels with Fudge & Peanut Buttery Swirls"""
24-07-2020T23:40:58,SpazztasticKiwi,is that a pet name
24-07-2020T23:41:04,CrRAR,it's amazing
24-07-2020T23:41:07,CrRAR,yes
24-07-2020T23:41:21,AspiringNoodle,...if you ever want ice cream just loaded to the effing moon with chocolate
24-07-2020T23:41:23,CrRAR,but with such a stupid name it's stuck around
24-07-2020T23:41:26,AspiringNoodle,Get magnum's pints...
24-07-2020T23:41:36,TorqueEmUp,I hate when they add fudge/peanut butter swirl/syrup to ice cream personally.
24-07-2020T23:41:40,AspiringNoodle,"Chocolate shell around the container, thick af chocolate swirls in the ice cream"
24-07-2020T23:41:47,AspiringNoodle,It is *ridic* choco overload
24-07-2020T23:42:06,CrRAR,"yeah I don't like it either, but I remember B&J did it justice"
24-07-2020T23:42:17,SpazztasticKiwi,at some point you gotta question why you don‚Äôt just buy a pint of straight fudge
24-07-2020T23:42:19,CrRAR,it can be gross tho I agree
24-07-2020T23:42:37,AspiringNoodle,"Spazz, just trust me on this"
24-07-2020T23:42:45,CrRAR,that's what I was saying it breaks the flavors contrasting
24-07-2020T23:42:46,AspiringNoodle,I've tried their regular milk chocolate one and white chocolate vanilla
24-07-2020T23:42:51,AspiringNoodle,Both are peak
24-07-2020T23:42:52,SpazztasticKiwi,oh i know what you‚Äôre talking about

24-07-2020T23:43:40,CrRAR,I just can't believe there is a ice cream brand named 'Magnum'
24-07-2020T23:43:47,AspiringNoodle,"Ord, don't remind me, lol"
24-07-2020T23:44:01,CrRAR,I know it exists I just am in dispelief when I see it in the freezers xD
24-07-2020T23:44:04,AspiringNoodle,I'm on the verge of buying two tubs of all-natural ice cream from a local brand
24-07-2020T23:44:06,TorqueEmUp,"Yeah, even though I love Reeses, Bryers Reeses is just plain bad."
24-07-2020T23:44:09,AspiringNoodle,2 for $7
24-07-2020T23:44:10,SpazztasticKiwi,dark & milk chocolate & fudge swirl cookie dough ice cream

24-07-2020T23:45:17,AspiringNoodle,But you guys have convinced me to find all Breyers ice cream
24-07-2020T23:45:18,SpazztasticKiwi,& my mom and sister leave it alone because it‚Äôs got coconut
24-07-2020T23:45:20,AspiringNoodle,And burn it @w@

24-07-2020T23:45:43,TorqueEmUp,"I think the worst Ice Cream I ever had was that Twinkie flavored Ice Cream. I don't remember the brand, but I couldn't finish it, it was so bad."

24-07-2020T23:46:16,AspiringNoodle,Tom's favorite flavor is the cheapest one :snail:
24-07-2020T23:46:22,CrRAR,yeah sponge cake does not belong in ice cream torque
24-07-2020T23:46:25,TorqueEmUp,I still like to indulge in those every once in a while.

24-07-2020T23:46:43,AspiringNoodle,Mmmmmmmmmm
24-07-2020T23:46:59,CrRAR,"it's like buying ice cream with cone pieces mixed in, it's always gonna be soggy tasting or stale"
24-07-2020T23:47:02,TorqueEmUp,I'd like Moose tracks better if it didn't have the fudge syrup in it.
24-07-2020T23:47:05,SpazztasticKiwi,ever heard of cookies n cream flavored oreos
24-07-2020T23:47:08,Ordithus,I can't even remember what my fav flavor was
