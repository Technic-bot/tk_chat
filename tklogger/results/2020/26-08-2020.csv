26-08-2020T00:52:42,Dadrobit,Everything is broken forever
26-08-2020T01:14:47,AspiringNoodle,I need to grow a pair and tell my parents that I'm not comfortable with eating out :/
26-08-2020T01:16:57,SpazztasticKiwi,why’s everything broken

26-08-2020T01:51:56,AspiringNoodle,Simple.  Nora broke it

26-08-2020T08:21:39,Dadrobit,But now the site is running entirely on the honor system.

26-08-2020T13:45:30,Dadrobit,"Alas, we are entirely dependent on our E-Security systems. Pencil and paper just can't cut it for the flow of people we can get. My phone is straight up turned off. Not coming in today for anything more than my shift and I know they're gonna try. Screw em"
26-08-2020T13:47:17,CrimsonQuill,"Uh-oh, bad week Dadrobit?"
26-08-2020T13:47:22,CrRAR,Makes sense you did say before it was a huge area.
26-08-2020T13:48:56,Dadrobit,"Nah, week's been fine up til now."
26-08-2020T13:50:12,Dadrobit,Yesterday our company's security software went kaboom. Totally bricked our systems outside of Patrol overwatch which is only helpful for seeing when my patrol guys are trying to sleep somewhere in the mountain.
26-08-2020T13:50:36,Dadrobit,But our iPads and half of our computers are paperweights at the moment.
26-08-2020T13:52:11,Dadrobit,Can't even check our client's guest lists' OR see their phone numbers to call them to verify access attempts.
26-08-2020T13:52:43,Dadrobit,I can imagine the flaming clown fiesta shitshow that place must be right about now.
26-08-2020T13:53:06,CrimsonQuill,"And apparently, pen and paper can't do the job because of the number of clients?"
26-08-2020T13:53:25,Dadrobit,Number and status.
26-08-2020T13:54:44,CrimsonQuill,"Dear God, that must be a nightmare."
26-08-2020T13:54:57,Dadrobit,Hence my phone being turned off.
26-08-2020T14:05:19,CrimsonQuill,...
26-08-2020T14:05:37,CrimsonQuill,"For your own sake, I hope that this makes your company have more paper-pen backup in future."
26-08-2020T14:47:38,Dadrobit,Not a chance.
26-08-2020T14:47:47,CrimsonQuill,...
26-08-2020T14:48:03,Dadrobit,They were elated when we finally got rid of the rows of filing cabinets we had.
26-08-2020T14:48:13,Dadrobit,Saved on paper expenditures.
26-08-2020T14:48:54,Dadrobit,"And considering they were threatening us all at the last quarterly meeting with just automating the whole system and doing away with the humans, yeah, I'm not seeing it."
26-08-2020T14:50:09,CrimsonQuill,"Seriously, not everything can be automated or done online, at least not yet."
26-08-2020T14:50:21,Dadrobit,A majority of the site is already like that.
26-08-2020T14:50:37,CrimsonQuill,"While I'm still studying for surveying, I know that we keep paper records of everything."
26-08-2020T14:50:46,Dadrobit,We have 25 communities that are already automated. Only 5 manned gates are left.
26-08-2020T14:51:04,CrimsonQuill,How does the automation work?
26-08-2020T14:52:02,Dadrobit,We keep one manned gate that hands out passes attached to the windows of the clients' cars. The gate arms read the tags and open automatically. Every gate including the manned ones already has the system in place.
26-08-2020T14:52:45,Dadrobit,"Then for guests and deliveries, a call box is installed where the clients can just open the gates themselves from their phones."
26-08-2020T14:53:29,Dadrobit,Everything is already in place. Humans are just here as a status symbol really.
26-08-2020T14:53:52,Dadrobit,"If you live behind a manned gate, you definitely have more money."
26-08-2020T14:54:40,Dadrobit,Cheapest place behind my gate currently is a lot selling for 5 million. It's totally empty. No house even built yet. Just 5 mil for the land.
26-08-2020T14:54:41,CrimsonQuill,...have there been malfunctions of any sort?
26-08-2020T14:55:07,CrimsonQuill,"Also, 5 million just for the land?!"
26-08-2020T14:55:20,CrimsonQuill,...I will never abide by land values.
26-08-2020T14:56:22,Dadrobit,"Sure, occasionally. But it's almost always linked back to human error when bad tags are discovered."
26-08-2020T14:56:59,Dadrobit,"And while the manned gates security systems are all down as I've mentioned, the automated services are still performing flawlessly."
26-08-2020T14:58:21,CrimsonQuill,I'm now wondering just how many more of our professions are being carted off to machines.
26-08-2020T14:58:44,CrimsonQuill,"While they are (in most cases) more efficient and reliable, there are some jobs that NEED a human element to them."
26-08-2020T14:58:45,Dadrobit,"Honestly, the only ""malfunctions"" I can recall that aren't because a human screwed up is because a tag is so old that the glue holding it in place has failed and the tag deactivates using it's anti-tamper system."
26-08-2020T14:59:28,Dadrobit,its*
26-08-2020T15:06:04,CrimsonQuill,Wow.
26-08-2020T15:06:17,CrimsonQuill,That is a decent record I must admit..

26-08-2020T21:41:28,AspiringNoodle,The jackass responsible for the same boring formula song + dance games from Ubisoft for the better part of a decade is no longer with the company
26-08-2020T21:41:47,CrRAR,Oh great
26-08-2020T21:42:13,CrRAR,Yeah dance/instrument games got done to death a while back

26-08-2020T21:43:02,AspiringNoodle,"Good news, fired for misconduct.  Bad news, probably raked in ridiculous boat loads of money by being an a-hole"
26-08-2020T21:43:32,AspiringNoodle,Dude was apparently a misogynist manchild
26-08-2020T21:43:41,CrRAR,It was like the wii days keep releasing the same thing the elementary school kiddies will keep buying it
26-08-2020T21:43:45,CrRAR,"Ah, i see"
26-08-2020T21:44:30,AspiringNoodle,"Not joking, reportedly during games pitches, if he didn't like your presentation, he would growl, moan, bang his head on the table, and so on if he didn't like your pitch or thought it was boring"
26-08-2020T21:45:14,AspiringNoodle,"You could have an *amazing* game idea.  We're talking genre defining like Super Mario 64, Horizon Zero Dawn, etc"
26-08-2020T21:45:24,AspiringNoodle,"But if he didn't personally like it / find it interesting, he would can it"
26-08-2020T21:45:42,AspiringNoodle,"So any games that got made more or less got tailored to his tastes, and his alone.  He had WAY too much power."
26-08-2020T21:46:37,CrRAR,Yeah internally companies can be like that to “keep brand image”

26-08-2020T21:48:37,AspiringNoodle,Think Tom Clancy's The Division.

26-08-2020T21:49:28,CrRAR,Till they finally deside to scrap an old look completely for something new
26-08-2020T21:50:01,AspiringNoodle,The problem is is that Ubisoft already has the Division for gamers who like that stuff
26-08-2020T21:50:21,AspiringNoodle,"They turned Breakpoint into a clone, and diverged from the Ghost Recon identity"
26-08-2020T21:50:23,CrRAR,"Though id one engineer ever said anything against the status quo before that, they’d probably be blackballed"

26-08-2020T21:52:00,AspiringNoodle,"So, they redid Breakpoint to be more like Wildlands"
26-08-2020T21:52:20,AspiringNoodle,"Not sure which version I'd play for certain, but like I said, am leaning more towards og iteration"
