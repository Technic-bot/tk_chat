23-12-2020T00:32:18,SpazztasticKiwi,he didn‚Äôt panic though
23-12-2020T00:32:45,SpazztasticKiwi,normally you see a cat get caught in a bag and it‚Äôs every man woman & child for itself

23-12-2020T11:30:39,AspiringNoodle,I think my phone really needs its battery replaced
23-12-2020T11:31:06,AspiringNoodle,It's getting to the point where a full charge will last a day at most.
23-12-2020T11:43:16,AspiringNoodle,"Also yay, I can work for Instacart <3"
23-12-2020T11:47:35,CrRAR,"yeah, 2 years seems to be like the ""planned obsolescence"" time frame."
23-12-2020T11:47:47,AspiringNoodle,"My phone is waaaaaaaaaaay older than that, lmao"
23-12-2020T11:48:02,CrRAR,oh wow good job
23-12-2020T11:48:05,AspiringNoodle,"iirc, I got it in february, and I believe it was 2016?"
23-12-2020T11:48:14,CrRAR,is it a Samsung?
23-12-2020T11:48:17,AspiringNoodle,Yes
23-12-2020T11:48:32,AspiringNoodle,It's honestly just battery degredation.
23-12-2020T11:48:32,CrRAR,yeah I feel like they care about batteries
23-12-2020T11:48:41,CrRAR,and their screens
23-12-2020T11:49:03,CrRAR,that's a good life though
23-12-2020T11:49:04,AspiringNoodle,"I gamed on my phone HEAVILY the first year I had it.  Eventually I backed off, with occasional binge sessions"
23-12-2020T11:49:30,AspiringNoodle,"But yeah, at this point the battery has probably lost a fair amount of capacity"
23-12-2020T11:50:05,AspiringNoodle,Glad I bought that new cable for charging though XD
23-12-2020T11:50:15,AspiringNoodle,Was losing my mind trying to charge this thing without fast charging
23-12-2020T11:50:17,CrRAR,a lot is just natural but yeah extra heat accelerates
23-12-2020T11:50:43,CrRAR,once they start dropping off it don't matter
23-12-2020T11:51:04,AspiringNoodle,I might just replace the battery
23-12-2020T11:51:08,AspiringNoodle,I love my s6~
23-12-2020T11:51:25,CrRAR,"I had the S5, t'was good"
23-12-2020T11:51:39,AspiringNoodle,"Also, I gots a zootopia phone case for it and I don't feel like trying to find the same design for a newer phone.  It probably ain't happenin'"
23-12-2020T11:51:43,CrRAR,the 6 was a big design refinement
23-12-2020T11:52:05,CrRAR,"yeah, never the exact same"
23-12-2020T11:52:18,AspiringNoodle,My phone case is literally just the movie poster xD
23-12-2020T11:52:35,CrRAR,"ah, cool"

23-12-2020T19:32:53,Ordithus,sounds like a mess
23-12-2020T19:33:02,SpazztasticKiwi,while I was stocking a cooler
23-12-2020T19:33:20,CrRAR,Oh no more holiday creep escapades
23-12-2020T19:34:03,SpazztasticKiwi,an old man comes from the other direction & I spent some time showing him where the pie crusts are & then checking their inventory when the shelf was empty
23-12-2020T19:34:33,SpazztasticKiwi,only when I go by him the third time helping this other man does he ask me if we have cold cocktail sauce
23-12-2020T19:35:03,SpazztasticKiwi,....that‚Äôs what you‚Äôve been staring holes in me for 10 minutes?
23-12-2020T19:36:22,Ordithus,:ptv-nope:
23-12-2020T19:39:04,CrRAR,even the shrimp in the freezer like
23-12-2020T19:39:07,CrRAR,:shrimp::shrimp::shrimp:*[wow rude]
23-12-2020T19:40:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"he was next to the crab/fish/oyster cooler, not the shrimp freezer"
23-12-2020T19:41:49,SpazztasticKiwi,"that stirs the question, I‚Äôve never tried crab with cocktail sauce , is that something people do"
23-12-2020T19:42:28,CrRAR,not that I know
23-12-2020T19:43:34,CrRAR,I feel like that would be like the whole putting ketchup on steak thing
23-12-2020T19:44:04,SpazztasticKiwi,crab is seafood like shrimp though
23-12-2020T19:44:09,AspiringNoodle,"Remember kids, asking for a steak well done is an insult to the chef :)"
23-12-2020T19:44:24,SpazztasticKiwi,so is oysters - don‚Äôt people put stuff on oysters
23-12-2020T19:44:37,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve yet to try oysters
23-12-2020T19:44:45,CrRAR,"tbh, cocktail sauce alone tastes like ghetto ketchup"
23-12-2020T19:44:49,SpazztasticKiwi,"which, who has seafood for Christmas anyway"
23-12-2020T19:44:57,Dadrobit,Oysters are meh by themselves. Oyster sauce is the shit for cooking though.
23-12-2020T19:45:04,CrRAR,Usually new years
23-12-2020T19:45:09,SpazztasticKiwi,oh yeah it‚Äôs got a sauce
23-12-2020T19:45:30,Ordithus,crab goes with butter
23-12-2020T19:45:33,Ordithus,simple
23-12-2020T19:45:39,CrRAR,Oysters are one of those... delicacies
23-12-2020T19:45:46,Dadrobit,"To be fair, butter goes with everything"
23-12-2020T19:45:53,SpazztasticKiwi,definitely better with butter ye
23-12-2020T19:46:10,SpazztasticKiwi,oysters look very
23-12-2020T19:46:13,Ordithus,butter even goes with butter
23-12-2020T19:46:14,SpazztasticKiwi,chewy
23-12-2020T19:46:20,CrRAR,"Lobster + butter, yeah crab tastes closer to shrimp"
23-12-2020T19:46:20,Ordithus,:cw0lfmare-Echolove: moar butter
23-12-2020T19:46:42,CrRAR,Oysters gloopy
23-12-2020T19:47:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"on the next episode of seafood breakdown, mussels"
23-12-2020T19:47:10,SpazztasticKiwi,(also never tried mussels)
23-12-2020T19:47:23,Ordithus,at no time do I wish for a modern stovetop more than when pan frying fish
23-12-2020T19:47:35,CrRAR,"Lots of seafood casseroles are just [seafood], cracker crumbs, and butter"
23-12-2020T19:47:36,Ordithus,this 61 year old thing has no concept of delicate
23-12-2020T19:47:40,Dadrobit,I make an effort to try everything I can. Oysters are just not worth it imo.
23-12-2020T19:47:50,Ordithus,mussels are yum
23-12-2020T19:47:56,Ordithus,lots of work

23-12-2020T19:48:40,Ordithus,"all the way across town, so not terribly in to take-out with them"
23-12-2020T19:48:44,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-LauraCry:
23-12-2020T19:48:53,Dadrobit,Tried a new-ish seafood place just before lockdown that made a pretty killer mussel soup.
23-12-2020T19:48:55,CrRAR,Yeah seafood tough for takeout
23-12-2020T19:49:18,CrRAR,long drive no good
23-12-2020T19:49:25,SpazztasticKiwi,...have you folks heard the old man and oyster restaurant story
23-12-2020T19:49:27,Dadrobit,"It was quite good, but more expensive than I think was neccessary maybe."
23-12-2020T19:50:05,CrRAR,Was the old man in the story end up being a perv? xD
23-12-2020T19:50:13,SpazztasticKiwi,no
23-12-2020T19:50:17,CrRAR,Ok lol
23-12-2020T19:50:34,Dadrobit,I'm guessing this has something to do with oysters being an aphrodisiac?
23-12-2020T19:50:47,SpazztasticKiwi,is that all you expect of me sharing anymore
23-12-2020T19:50:57,CrRAR,noooo

23-12-2020T19:54:42,SpazztasticKiwi,"yeah well I‚Äôve already had plenty comment on the presence of Bagheera, Se√°n, & Shuler"
23-12-2020T19:55:11,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve evidently started to annoy certain people already
23-12-2020T19:58:41,Ordithus,too bad for them
23-12-2020T20:01:50,Dadrobit,aye
23-12-2020T20:06:08,AspiringNoodle,Bagheera is best boi~
23-12-2020T20:06:17,AspiringNoodle,And Sean is funny boi :D
23-12-2020T20:06:56,CrRAR,except when he gets curious with the cheese
23-12-2020T20:07:21,AspiringNoodle,Then he a cheesy boi
23-12-2020T20:08:52,SpazztasticKiwi,well he just tried to help himself to my sunflower seeds
23-12-2020T20:08:58,SpazztasticKiwi,I swear I feed him
23-12-2020T20:09:54,CrRAR,he does seem to have quite an appetite
23-12-2020T20:10:32,CrRAR,maybe the cooler weather recently requires more energy?
23-12-2020T20:10:41,Ordithus,such a strange cat
23-12-2020T20:11:56,CrRAR,He like ‚Äúif winter‚Äôs coming I best fatten up‚Äù
23-12-2020T20:12:35,SpazztasticKiwi,he‚Äôs already there
23-12-2020T20:12:54,Ordithus,kiwi needs to step up her game
23-12-2020T20:13:00,Ordithus,get the STORIES
23-12-2020T20:13:12,CrRAR,Like just collect a bunch of those old Kim Jong memes of ‚Äúcan I eat dis‚Äù and ‚Äòshop Bageera‚Äôs head in
23-12-2020T20:13:17,CrRAR,:ptv-laugh:
23-12-2020T20:13:36,SpazztasticKiwi,with the days I was feeding him wet food & letting him have whatever amount of dry kibble he wanted - mother said he felt light - he became quite the chunky boi
23-12-2020T20:13:52,SpazztasticKiwi,heafty
23-12-2020T20:14:23,SpazztasticKiwi,he‚Äôs had dewormer
23-12-2020T20:14:30,SpazztasticKiwi,he‚Äôs just always hungry
23-12-2020T20:20:10,CrRAR,"I think we can all agree, ‚Äòyay, food‚Äô"
23-12-2020T20:20:55,SpazztasticKiwi,"no kidding, I poured his and Kiwis food as soon as I was in the door & he starts eating"
23-12-2020T20:21:27,SpazztasticKiwi,"once I‚Äôm undressed & in bed with my sunflower seeds, he‚Äôs right there trying to stick his head in the container"
23-12-2020T20:21:40,CrRAR,what of his behavior changed like less lounging more hungry restlessness?
23-12-2020T20:21:51,CrRAR,wow
23-12-2020T20:23:24,SpazztasticKiwi,he‚Äôs still playful but he likes his box to hop around in
23-12-2020T20:23:45,CrRAR,Are sunflower seeds even something cats would go for?
23-12-2020T20:23:54,SpazztasticKiwi,he tried one
23-12-2020T20:24:04,SpazztasticKiwi,doesn‚Äôt seem impressed
23-12-2020T20:24:18,CrRAR,Are the normal salty?
23-12-2020T20:24:23,CrRAR,Or are they husked?
23-12-2020T20:24:33,SpazztasticKiwi,they‚Äôre shelled
23-12-2020T20:24:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt get unshelled
23-12-2020T20:24:52,CrRAR,"yeah, husked already is so much more convienient"
23-12-2020T20:25:02,CrRAR,husked/shelled
23-12-2020T20:25:05,SpazztasticKiwi,& he couldnt have them shelled
23-12-2020T20:25:19,CrRAR,yeah I would think that bad
23-12-2020T20:25:29,SpazztasticKiwi,can‚Äôt give him any really because of the salt
23-12-2020T20:26:00,SpazztasticKiwi,I figure he‚Äôs eating more because of winter because in summer he won‚Äôt do anything but snack
23-12-2020T20:26:20,CrRAR,"yeah salt is bad for humans, cats are like 1/5th our size so I can only imagine"
23-12-2020T20:26:36,SpazztasticKiwi,he likes sitting on the bed with the heater going
23-12-2020T20:26:48,CrRAR,"Yeah, I would think more body heat req‚Äôd to be made = more energy burnt"
23-12-2020T20:27:52,SpazztasticKiwi,well he‚Äôs got his dry kibble out & I got him a canned food out
23-12-2020T20:27:56,CrRAR,Does kiwi seem as sensitive to the cooler weather?
23-12-2020T20:28:07,SpazztasticKiwi,she‚Äôs a long hair
23-12-2020T20:28:13,CrRAR,Ahhh
23-12-2020T20:28:30,SpazztasticKiwi,she spends her time as a loaf on the living room chair most of the time
23-12-2020T20:28:53,SpazztasticKiwi,she‚Äôs the normal one
23-12-2020T20:28:57,SpazztasticKiwi,for the most part
23-12-2020T20:30:03,CrRAR,none escape the the zoomies instinct
23-12-2020T20:30:24,SpazztasticKiwi,he had his head in the can as soon as I popped the lid off - I suspect he‚Äôs not gonna eat his dry food till that‚Äôs gone now
23-12-2020T20:32:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Kiwi is odd since she doesn‚Äôt have a mew
23-12-2020T20:33:16,CrRAR,silent as a puffy cloud
23-12-2020T20:33:42,Ordithus,"food consumed and cleaned up, relax time"
23-12-2020T20:33:52,CrRAR,"does she try, or is it just not her thing?"
23-12-2020T20:33:57,SpazztasticKiwi,she purrs nonstop like a runaway freight train but she doesn‚Äôt make noise
23-12-2020T20:34:04,CrRAR,:cw0lfmare-Smugfox: nice ord
23-12-2020T20:34:13,SpazztasticKiwi,she opens her mouth & most of the time you don‚Äôt hear anything
23-12-2020T20:34:24,CrRAR,ah
23-12-2020T20:34:25,SpazztasticKiwi,sometimes you hear a squeak noise
23-12-2020T20:34:35,CrRAR,pfhh
23-12-2020T20:35:56,SpazztasticKiwi,even her hiss is underwhelming
23-12-2020T20:35:59,CrRAR,When Bagheera hears a squeak he knows she means srs business
23-12-2020T20:36:44,SpazztasticKiwi,she hisses at him as a greeting
23-12-2020T20:36:56,Ordithus,[hello there]*:ctwokinds-flomad:
23-12-2020T20:36:58,CrRAR,ha
23-12-2020T20:37:04,SpazztasticKiwi,8 year old doe not want to play and frolic with 4 year old
23-12-2020T20:37:08,SpazztasticKiwi,old
23-12-2020T20:37:13,SpazztasticKiwi,does
23-12-2020T20:38:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Kiwi has bubble
23-12-2020T20:38:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera gets in that bubble
23-12-2020T20:38:35,CrRAR,pandemonium
23-12-2020T20:39:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Kiwi was an only cat for awhile so she plays with her own toys alone but Bagheera sees her and wants to join
23-12-2020T20:39:58,CrRAR,Yea I wonder is being a solo cat/not as socialized leads to quieter cats?
23-12-2020T20:41:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I got her as a pretty small kitten but I don‚Äôt know anything about her before that
23-12-2020T20:41:38,SpazztasticKiwi,all I know is she doesn‚Äôt like men or strangers
23-12-2020T20:41:54,Ordithus,few cats like strangers
23-12-2020T20:42:13,Ordithus,new thing? hide!
23-12-2020T20:43:50,CrRAR,‚Äúgo away and take your strange new smells with you‚Äù
23-12-2020T20:46:26,SpazztasticKiwi,"I gave a friend of mine a bag of treats to give her whenever she came over, she warmed up to her in like 2 visits"
23-12-2020T20:46:34,SpazztasticKiwi,ex boyfriend tried the same thing
23-12-2020T20:47:05,SpazztasticKiwi,5 year relationship
23-12-2020T20:47:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"‚Äúfat fcking chance, chad‚Äú"
23-12-2020T20:48:13,SpazztasticKiwi,never got her to come out of hiding for a snack
23-12-2020T20:49:25,CrRAR,haa
23-12-2020T20:50:42,CrRAR,The cat hath spoken
23-12-2020T20:51:51,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like it - take it back‚Äù
23-12-2020T20:53:05,Ordithus,"""cat was here first, sorry"""
23-12-2020T20:53:17,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-zenshocked:
23-12-2020T20:53:45,SpazztasticKiwi,oh he knew that
23-12-2020T20:54:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I told him the cat comes first with me
23-12-2020T20:54:30,SpazztasticKiwi,he wasn‚Äôt happy he was outranked by a 15 pound ball of fur
23-12-2020T20:54:36,SpazztasticKiwi,he didn‚Äôt like cats
23-12-2020T20:54:38,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
23-12-2020T20:54:48,CrRAR,"I‚Äôd make a ‚Äúwhat the cat dragged in‚Äù joke, but seems cruel."
23-12-2020T20:56:08,CrRAR,cats are so chill
23-12-2020T20:56:10,SpazztasticKiwi,this is the ex I said contacted me awhile ago after 5 years of n o t h i n g
23-12-2020T20:56:25,SpazztasticKiwi,he told me he has a cat
23-12-2020T20:56:33,Ordithus,whaaaaaaaaat
23-12-2020T20:56:48,CrRAR,"ah, skilled casanova"
23-12-2020T20:56:48,Dadrobit,"I can understand liking some animals more than others, but I cannot fathom just not liking cats at all."
23-12-2020T20:56:56,Dadrobit,Minus allergies of course
23-12-2020T20:57:11,SpazztasticKiwi,no allergies
23-12-2020T20:57:16,SpazztasticKiwi,he just didn‚Äôt like em
23-12-2020T20:57:21,SpazztasticKiwi,dog person
23-12-2020T20:58:03,SpazztasticKiwi,as we got close to the possibility of moving in together he knew I wasn‚Äôt going anywhere without the cat
23-12-2020T20:58:38,CrRAR,wow
23-12-2020T20:59:04,Dadrobit,ain't nobody worth abandoning an adopted animal
23-12-2020T20:59:15,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt know how or if he was upset about it
23-12-2020T20:59:53,Ordithus,love cats and dogs
23-12-2020T20:59:54,SpazztasticKiwi,but I know he knew - but with her not liking him I don‚Äôt believe he was thrilled
23-12-2020T21:00:10,Ordithus,"sometimes my friends swear I'm visiting their pets, not them"
23-12-2020T21:00:56,CrRAR,‚ÄúI brought the cat condo and 6 bags of assorted treats‚Äù
23-12-2020T21:00:59,SpazztasticKiwi,what sticks most in my mind is the day he basically threatened her
23-12-2020T21:01:11,CrRAR,Threatened... a cat?
23-12-2020T21:01:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"I said we could try seeing if she‚Äôs let him hold her because she‚Äôs not a mean cat, she‚Äôs just a wiggler/runner"
23-12-2020T21:02:11,SpazztasticKiwi,but she might scratch him getting away (she‚Äôs done that to me jumping out of my arms)
23-12-2020T21:02:51,Ordithus,typical cat thing
23-12-2020T21:02:56,SpazztasticKiwi,he said something involving his pocket knife & he must‚Äôve heard the danger in my silence because he back tracked really
23-12-2020T21:02:59,SpazztasticKiwi,fucking
23-12-2020T21:03:01,SpazztasticKiwi,quick
23-12-2020T21:03:06,CrRAR,Have claws... will claw
23-12-2020T21:03:15,Ordithus,fluffy balls of daggers
23-12-2020T21:06:20,SpazztasticKiwi,his mother liked cats
23-12-2020T21:06:49,SpazztasticKiwi,his dad went along with her having cats but I‚Äôm not sure if he liked them or didn‚Äôt care
23-12-2020T21:07:28,SpazztasticKiwi,his sisters loved cats & his brother liked them but they liked animals period
23-12-2020T21:08:32,CrRAR,Pets just make a house more cozy
23-12-2020T21:11:09,SpazztasticKiwi,"oh, interesting conversation I had with a guy once"
23-12-2020T21:11:14,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like cats‚Äù
23-12-2020T21:11:19,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúI have two cats‚Äù
23-12-2020T21:11:25,SpazztasticKiwi,‚Äúcats are cool‚Äù
23-12-2020T21:11:36,SpazztasticKiwi,did you hurt your neck on that turn?
23-12-2020T21:11:42,CrRAR,xD
23-12-2020T21:12:13,CrRAR,‚ÄúWhat happened to the first person I was talking to and what did you do with him?‚Äù
23-12-2020T21:12:24,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-rose:*[you've changed]
23-12-2020T21:22:25,SpazztasticKiwi,never seen an opinion flip so fast in my life
23-12-2020T21:22:37,SpazztasticKiwi,aside from a trump supporter
23-12-2020T21:32:37,SpazztasticKiwi,lady on fb wants someone to install a 70 inch flatscreen with their own tools for $50
23-12-2020T21:34:52,CrRAR,"It‚Äôs not incredibly hard, I put up a 65‚Äù but placement is a bit finicky and the wiring if ya want it done right is actually more tedious"
23-12-2020T21:35:41,CrRAR,"tbh, it‚Äôs a two person thing too, cuz you need someone else to lift the thing up"
23-12-2020T21:35:57,CrRAR,esp at that size
23-12-2020T21:36:28,CrRAR,$50 seems like a tough sell
23-12-2020T21:37:46,SpazztasticKiwi,my brain went somewhere completely different
23-12-2020T21:37:50,SpazztasticKiwi,‚Äúrob me‚Äù
23-12-2020T21:38:05,CrRAR,Ah true
23-12-2020T21:38:34,CrRAR,On fb tho you might get friends of friends or something?
23-12-2020T21:38:44,CrRAR,or is tha fb marketplace?
23-12-2020T21:39:17,CrRAR,"*dude walks in, grabs tv*"
23-12-2020T21:39:21,CrRAR,*walks out*
23-12-2020T21:40:08,SpazztasticKiwi,marketplace
23-12-2020T21:40:42,CrRAR,Ah yeah could be trouble
23-12-2020T21:41:52,SpazztasticKiwi,and with mr whiplash option comes I don‚Äôt consider myself attractive but maybe just average
23-12-2020T21:42:23,SpazztasticKiwi,yet there‚Äôs some interactions that make me question if some guys have wver spoken to another human
23-12-2020T21:44:45,CrRAR,"like random public interactions? Those can be weird, people have become more standoffish and scared-not-to-be-PC over time"
23-12-2020T21:45:11,CrRAR,Everyone feels like they‚Äôre about to be punk‚Äôd or something xD
23-12-2020T21:46:45,CrRAR,Like it is weird how in the interconnected future real-life has become more disconnected
23-12-2020T21:47:43,CrRAR,It‚Äôs just like the train station everyone is occuping between all the social media and digital connections
23-12-2020T21:50:11,CrRAR,"Maybe someday when everyone is wearing like, google glasses, or something it will just point out all the cool people."

23-12-2020T21:51:37,SpazztasticKiwi,I grew up as one of those asked out as a joke
23-12-2020T21:51:59,SpazztasticKiwi,& I was pretty fat
23-12-2020T21:52:18,SpazztasticKiwi,especially for those hs years
23-12-2020T21:52:48,CrRAR,hs is just awkward for everyone
23-12-2020T21:53:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm a to myself person in general but a different person with people I know or share stuff with
23-12-2020T21:54:01,SpazztasticKiwi,always suspicious of someone‚Äôs end goal though
23-12-2020T21:55:14,SpazztasticKiwi,wasn‚Äôt a fan of that guy when he started becoming a yes man
23-12-2020T21:55:52,CrRAR,"hhmm, authenticity is important"
23-12-2020T21:58:02,SpazztasticKiwi,still not sure if he was only playing the long game to try to get a ‚Äúdate‚Äù
23-12-2020T21:58:50,SpazztasticKiwi,or if he thought my engagement was interest
23-12-2020T21:59:38,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ùóÔ∏èKiwi has the zoomies‚ùóÔ∏è
23-12-2020T21:59:43,Ordithus,some guys see every interaction with girls that way

23-12-2020T21:59:59,CrRAR,already with the zoomies?
23-12-2020T22:00:07,SpazztasticKiwi,she‚Äôs doing a heckin run through the hall
23-12-2020T22:01:10,SpazztasticKiwi,she has the occasional play moment - winter might mean it‚Äôs cool enough for her to burn energy without getting hot
23-12-2020T22:01:22,CrRAR,I feel like when it comes to people past behavior is also best gauge of current and future behavior
23-12-2020T22:01:48,CrRAR,true
23-12-2020T22:01:57,CrRAR,Arctic kitty energy
23-12-2020T22:02:44,Ordithus,do the cats yowl in the middle of the night?

23-12-2020T22:03:44,SpazztasticKiwi,they might if they‚Äôve caught something but that‚Äôs my sisters & moms cat mostly
23-12-2020T22:04:01,SpazztasticKiwi,thing is he‚Äôs  sick & down & doesn‚Äôt have family around & just a few friends around
23-12-2020T22:04:50,SpazztasticKiwi,he‚Äôs a fan of mark
23-12-2020T22:05:11,CrRAR,yay
23-12-2020T22:05:58,SpazztasticKiwi,we started interacting more based on that but I wonder if he started using it at one point to get my attention or keep me around
23-12-2020T22:07:00,SpazztasticKiwi,I know he was having a rough time for the most part & he got fired from missing so many days being too out of it to work
23-12-2020T22:07:16,CrRAR,I feel like the best indicator of good person is like they pay attention to little things
23-12-2020T22:07:52,CrRAR,"Like little gifts and such that show they pay attention or listen, like just to surprise or make ther other happy"
23-12-2020T22:08:25,SpazztasticKiwi,"men have feelings too & if he was open enough to tell me he was suicidal, I can‚Äôt NOT keep tabs"
23-12-2020T22:08:31,CrRAR,I mean not everyone is skilled at that... but TRYing is important
23-12-2020T22:08:51,Ordithus,"dang, does sound like he's in a bad way"
23-12-2020T22:09:05,CrRAR,is this still ex-boyfriend?
23-12-2020T22:09:18,SpazztasticKiwi,nope
23-12-2020T22:09:44,SpazztasticKiwi,this guy I used to work with - I‚Äôve known him maybe 3+ years at this point
23-12-2020T22:09:45,Ordithus,"hasn't been for a while, pay attention man"
23-12-2020T22:09:54,SpazztasticKiwi,but if that sort of thing comes up with you mentioning you‚Äôve been single awhile....
23-12-2020T22:10:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I am suspicious
23-12-2020T22:10:33,CrRAR,"haha ord, got thrown by the ‚Äúrough times‚Äù thing"
23-12-2020T22:10:41,CrRAR,mmm
23-12-2020T22:12:11,CrRAR,yeah coming to someone‚Äôs ‚Äúrescue‚Äù can work but ya gotta use your intuition.
23-12-2020T22:12:23,CrRAR,some holes are too deep
23-12-2020T22:13:11,SpazztasticKiwi,"I want to keep tabs on you but if you think it‚Äôs anything more than friends that you‚Äôre getting, you‚Äôre gonna be pitifully disappointed"
23-12-2020T22:13:43,SpazztasticKiwi,"he‚Äôs not slick because at one point I got the feeling he liked me, or was on his way there"
23-12-2020T22:14:12,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm not stupid & I‚Äôm sure not blind because I can see you staring even if my eyes aren‚Äôt in your direction
23-12-2020T22:15:18,Ordithus,time for pie
23-12-2020T22:15:20,SpazztasticKiwi,but twice he asked me over for dink‚Äôs and ‚Äúsmoking‚Äù (likely not cigarettes) & I don‚Äôt drink - he should know this well - & sure don‚Äôt smoke
23-12-2020T22:15:33,SpazztasticKiwi,anything
23-12-2020T22:15:57,CrRAR,hmmm
23-12-2020T22:16:51,CrRAR,"Yeah I mean there are some compromises on both sides in a relationship, but accepting things shouldn‚Äôt ALL be one-sided"
23-12-2020T22:16:54,SpazztasticKiwi,if at one point he‚Äôd asked for a date I would‚Äôve but the way he went about it and acts in general killed all chances
23-12-2020T22:17:26,CrRAR,Like if he knew that about no drinking/smoking hopefully he would next suggest something you might enjoy doing
23-12-2020T22:18:03,CrRAR,like the museums thing
23-12-2020T22:19:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt know how interested he was in relationships for the relationship part
23-12-2020T22:19:18,CrRAR,yeahhh
23-12-2020T22:19:19,SpazztasticKiwi,my theory is it‚Äôs low
23-12-2020T22:20:13,SpazztasticKiwi,"which is fine, if that‚Äôs how you ‚Äúdate‚Äù - but that‚Äôs not me so in simple terms, move on"
23-12-2020T22:21:26,SpazztasticKiwi,"if you meet girls to do mostly that as your relationship, and she‚Äôs on that same page, knock yourself out"
23-12-2020T22:21:45,CrRAR,"Yeahh, that is dating to a lot of people"
23-12-2020T22:22:07,CrRAR,"chance encounters, s‚Äôwhat happens, happens."
