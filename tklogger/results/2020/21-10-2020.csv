21-10-2020T14:08:48,CrRAR,shadow of a memory
21-10-2020T14:11:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t remember a sequel
21-10-2020T14:14:09,CrRAR,Ohhh shoot did anyone see Nora in the chandelier?

21-10-2020T15:03:31,CrRAR,and looks like she’s looking at the rucksack by the door
21-10-2020T15:12:36,Roughlandin,I think she's looking at US
21-10-2020T15:16:04,Roughlandin,I like that burnt orange sweater on Sythe! Looks cozy!
21-10-2020T15:17:43,CrRAR,yeah!
21-10-2020T15:18:21,CrRAR,"Is she, maybe, I thought even lower at like Trace/Flora wut the raining is broken, I thought that was weird"

21-10-2020T15:18:31,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-traceflohug:
21-10-2020T15:18:50,CrRAR,raining = railing
21-10-2020T15:20:14,CrRAR,In the old Tavern picture poster she was trying to catch Nora
21-10-2020T15:20:38,CrRAR,I wonder if Nora leapt away to the chandelier?
21-10-2020T15:20:46,CrRAR,Breaking the railing?
21-10-2020T15:31:49,Roughlandin,Makes sense to me!
21-10-2020T15:34:11,Roughlandin,"The things I'm most curious about are what's going on with the riftwall (which I'm guessing will be dealt with in the next arc after the Manor arc concludes) and whether our spoopy friend is Detritus, or... something else"
21-10-2020T15:34:53,CrRAR,"Oh yeah, right? I suspect the riftwall can be ‘reprogrammed’ maybe?"
21-10-2020T15:35:12,CrRAR,Or even just used as a point of entry to Edinmire from the other side
21-10-2020T15:35:38,CrRAR,*Wolf horde piles out of Tavern like last call in Louisiana*
21-10-2020T15:35:51,CrRAR,*arrroooowooowooowooooo*
21-10-2020T15:36:40,CrRAR,“FORRR THE PACKKK!!!”
21-10-2020T15:37:00,Roughlandin,Maybe because the only other alternative is that whoever opened it at the end of chapter 20 did from the Riftwall East. Which... probably doesn't mean good stuff for Amelia
21-10-2020T15:37:19,CrRAR,"Yeah, the “whum”"
21-10-2020T15:37:49,CrRAR,"Yeah, well maybe being kidnapped will keep Adira out of harm’s way?"
21-10-2020T15:38:06,Roughlandin,Hopefully! Eheheh
21-10-2020T15:38:07,CrRAR,Even if it’s also a bad thing being abducted?
21-10-2020T15:38:20,CrRAR,Like out of the fire into the frying pan?
21-10-2020T15:38:36,CrRAR,Not... the other way xD
21-10-2020T15:38:45,Roughlandin,"Eh, it's Keiran and Lt Reed. What's the worst they could do to her? Bicker at each other until they annoy her to death?"
21-10-2020T15:40:13,Roughlandin,Keiren! I ALWAYS misspell his name! It sounds too much like Keidran!
21-10-2020T15:41:12,CrRAR,"Yeah, but we don’t 100% know if those are real guards. I find it interesting the guard would abduct Adira with no regard for Maeve’s well being."
21-10-2020T15:41:30,CrRAR,If they know and live in the same community
21-10-2020T15:41:58,CrRAR,Cuz Adria has been described as well loved in the community in her char sheet
21-10-2020T15:42:13,CrimsonQuill,Playing Halo 3 coop with friend
21-10-2020T15:42:20,CrimsonQuill,Having so much fun!
21-10-2020T15:42:22,CrimsonQuill,:)
21-10-2020T15:42:32,CrRAR,...and smash her cooking bowl so hastily
21-10-2020T15:42:45,Roughlandin,"True, but they ARE humans and thus... kinda racist. Or they could be Guild members in disguise again. Clearing the way for a a wolf army to come through the riftwall?"
21-10-2020T15:42:49,CrRAR,:ptv-whiny:
21-10-2020T15:42:58,CrRAR,Yeah maybe
21-10-2020T15:43:14,Roughlandin,Maeve didn't get her pancakes! She's been hungry for YEARS!
21-10-2020T15:43:43,Roughlandin,"Well, most of this year"
21-10-2020T15:43:44,CrRAR,"The guards are referenced as “guardians” in the transcript, but can’t really go on that"
21-10-2020T15:43:48,CrRAR,True lol

21-10-2020T15:44:21,Roughlandin,"Man, was the end of chapter 20 only back in March? The pace of action has REALLY picked up in chapter 21"

21-10-2020T15:48:27,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,"Yes, the anniversary one"
21-10-2020T15:49:07,Roughlandin,"I was going to guess Tom's warm up sketch from Sunday. Did he ever post that anywhere, btw?"
21-10-2020T15:49:22,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,I don’t think so
21-10-2020T15:49:27,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,Which is sad
21-10-2020T15:49:30,Roughlandin,Tis

21-10-2020T20:40:19,CrRAR,"That played on the title screen, right?"
21-10-2020T20:40:26,CrRAR,I love that track
21-10-2020T20:40:53,CrRAR,Wahhh wahh wahhhh wahhhhhh
21-10-2020T20:41:08,CrRAR,wah wah
21-10-2020T20:45:29,K3IDRAN,Yes that one
21-10-2020T20:45:45,CrRAR,So good
21-10-2020T20:47:19,K3IDRAN,Ikr it's even on Halo 4s OST as a Bonus track & in the Halo Legends Anime
21-10-2020T20:48:30,CrRAR,"That’s pretty nice to know actually, at least Marty got some recognition after the fact."
21-10-2020T20:48:39,K3IDRAN,Yeap
21-10-2020T20:49:10,K3IDRAN,What sbout Reach's version called We Remember
21-10-2020T20:49:57,CrRAR,"idk, I’ve probably heard it, is it a lot different?"
21-10-2020T20:50:10,K3IDRAN,Yeap
21-10-2020T20:51:12,K3IDRAN,Bungie firing Marty is probably the most dumbest thing  they've fone
21-10-2020T20:51:34,K3IDRAN,And muthafakin' Armor lock
21-10-2020T20:51:51,K3IDRAN,AND KILL YIMERS
21-10-2020T20:51:57,K3IDRAN,TIMERS
21-10-2020T20:53:33,CrRAR,"Yeah, end of an era for the company"
21-10-2020T20:54:26,CrRAR,I mean even Jason Jones left when Activision blocked his narrative direction
21-10-2020T20:55:27,K3IDRAN,It's like if Bethesda fired Jeremy doule and replaced with a feneric one in Skyrim
21-10-2020T20:55:50,K3IDRAN,It's just not. Skyrim without the Soule
21-10-2020T20:58:57,CrRAR,"Wait though I think Reach Marty was still around for. It’s funny, the map “Ivory Tower” I’m pretty sure was what the called Marty’s studio or something."
21-10-2020T20:59:15,K3IDRAN,Lol
21-10-2020T20:59:22,CrRAR,It’s funny that that track version changed a bit
21-10-2020T21:00:07,CrRAR,Yeah here: https://bungie.fandom.com/wiki/The_Ivory_Tower
21-10-2020T21:00:31,K3IDRAN,Hope Marty is on Infinite
21-10-2020T21:00:51,CrRAR,That’s why the remake of the map was much more cozy and felt more residential
21-10-2020T21:01:19,CrRAR,Though Reach Maps were revisit of campaign locations/vice versa
21-10-2020T21:01:40,CrRAR,I thought that was both cool about Reach and a little surprising.
21-10-2020T21:02:17,CrRAR,"...at least for Bungie, with maps typically being all completely original"
21-10-2020T21:02:29,K3IDRAN,Bungie still vibes to O Donnell
21-10-2020T21:03:21,CrRAR,"Oh yeah, can’t forget the roots"
21-10-2020T21:03:50,CrRAR,They at least hope want to honor the legacy
21-10-2020T21:04:27,K3IDRAN,Yeap

21-10-2020T21:15:27,K3IDRAN,Found a UI Concept for. Halo ODST 2
21-10-2020T21:17:14,CrRAR,"There’s a 2? ODST was interesting, it explored such a minor facet of the series... it kind of was a stylistic experiment I feel like within Bungie"
21-10-2020T21:17:29,CrRAR,It had a specific charm
21-10-2020T21:17:37,CrRAR,"Gritty, but charming"
21-10-2020T21:17:54,K3IDRAN,"""no just a fanmade UI one"
21-10-2020T21:18:02,CrRAR,Ahh I see
21-10-2020T21:18:34,CrRAR,It did sort of feel like a prototype for Reach
21-10-2020T21:18:42,K3IDRAN,"But ye ODST Is telling you""you're Human you've always have been"""
21-10-2020T21:18:45,K3IDRAN,True dat
21-10-2020T21:18:50,CrRAR,The more group-driven individual stories
21-10-2020T21:18:58,CrRAR,Yeah!
21-10-2020T21:20:01,CrRAR,"Kinda Reach in reverse now that I think about it, like you’re alone everything’s dark and broody then you meet up and assemble with the others"
21-10-2020T21:20:14,CrRAR,If I remember right
21-10-2020T21:20:39,CrRAR,Reach starts out cheery and hopeful and slowly get separated or KIA
21-10-2020T21:21:18,CrRAR,"That’s the part that a lot of people critized Reach for, but it was a powerful story well told."
21-10-2020T21:21:21,K3IDRAN,Kat...
21-10-2020T21:21:31,CrRAR,"I guess not cheery, but bright."
21-10-2020T21:22:51,K3IDRAN,Imagine a Halo 3 ODST Anniversary
21-10-2020T21:24:51,K3IDRAN,Ray Tracing would help slot
21-10-2020T21:24:54,CrRAR,Mmm

21-10-2020T21:28:53,K3IDRAN,343 Guilty spark
21-10-2020T21:29:03,CrRAR,Yeah I liked the updates in the remakes I just felt some of the architecture style and things were OVERembellished
21-10-2020T21:29:40,K3IDRAN,It ruins Immerion
21-10-2020T21:29:43,CrRAR,Like “ooo lets make it look EXTRA technological”
21-10-2020T21:29:57,CrRAR,When I think Bungie more intended Monolithic
21-10-2020T21:30:29,K3IDRAN,"""pet make 343 a bright lol"""
21-10-2020T21:30:34,K3IDRAN,So

21-10-2020T21:31:29,K3IDRAN,Halo 2 has a etter Remaster
21-10-2020T21:31:34,K3IDRAN,Better
21-10-2020T21:33:11,CrRAR,"Yeah they, had more style to go off of"
21-10-2020T21:33:45,CrRAR,"Halo CE they were probably like: “Uhhh, this is a blank canvas”"
21-10-2020T21:34:00,K3IDRAN,And the Golden. Warthog becomes a thng now

21-10-2020T21:36:45,K3IDRAN,Halo Reach Anniversary
21-10-2020T21:39:37,CrRAR,"That was the thing too about classic game development, I wouldn’t be surprised if when they found hilarious bugs, they probably had a heartly laugh and were like “We’re... leaving that one in there”"
21-10-2020T21:40:11,CrRAR,That probably explains most Bethesda’s and Bungie’s funniest ridiculous stuff
