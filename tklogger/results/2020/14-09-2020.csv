14-09-2020T00:00:21,SpazztasticKiwi,exhaustingly chaotic maybe but rarely adorable
14-09-2020T00:02:45,SpazztasticKiwi,this meme format is about the consensus of jumping into Marks work nowadays https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/524825976597643265/755292331338498098/image0.png
14-09-2020T00:02:49,Dadrobit,"Nah, he was full on adorable back in yonder day."
14-09-2020T00:03:17,SpazztasticKiwi,oh yeah younger him sorta was
14-09-2020T00:03:36,SpazztasticKiwi,you know their mother has been posting baby pictures on ig
14-09-2020T00:03:49,SpazztasticKiwi,literally no change
14-09-2020T00:04:00,Dadrobit,"Iirc, he wanted to be like Freddie Wong, and his post was just like, ""guys I'm not good yet, but I just got a camera and I'm gonna make it some day as a let's player!"""
14-09-2020T00:04:20,Dadrobit,He was all the way adorable.
14-09-2020T00:04:49,SpazztasticKiwi,"google facial recognition labels him as “american actor, influencer, & personality”"
14-09-2020T00:05:25,Dadrobit,I remember talking to my family at a buffet later on trying to get them to watch him as well so he could get every hit possible.
14-09-2020T00:05:57,SpazztasticKiwi,I remember watching a video and Mark made some snide comment
14-09-2020T00:06:15,SpazztasticKiwi,from my sisters room: *cackling*
14-09-2020T00:06:54,SpazztasticKiwi,apparently he can be heard through walls
14-09-2020T00:07:19,SpazztasticKiwi,then she started watching his try not to laughs but that was about it
14-09-2020T00:07:53,SpazztasticKiwi,can’t tell if she ever learned his name though because she normally called them out by hair color
14-09-2020T00:08:06,SpazztasticKiwi,but then they all dyed their hair back
14-09-2020T00:08:23,Dadrobit,"Variety channels in general don't hold my attention very long. Fun for short burt's, but I really like focused content."
14-09-2020T00:08:36,Dadrobit,Bursts*
14-09-2020T00:08:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Mark became “the one that swears all the time” Seán was “the Irish one” and Ethan was “the one that was my age”
14-09-2020T00:09:12,SpazztasticKiwi,my mother seems to think they’re all the same person still
14-09-2020T00:11:11,SpazztasticKiwi,few years ago my grandma got into me about Mark telling me about a redheaded youtuber that had been arrested for targeting and luring in children playing minecraft
14-09-2020T00:11:25,SpazztasticKiwi,she thought they’d been talking about Mark
14-09-2020T00:11:37,Dadrobit,RIP Mark
14-09-2020T00:12:17,SpazztasticKiwi,indeed a redheaded youtuber had been arrested but he was a natural redhead
14-09-2020T00:12:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Marks hair obviously was a dye job - and not a naturally occurring red
14-09-2020T00:13:10,SpazztasticKiwi,after trying to get through to the room - because then my mom had gotten into the debate
14-09-2020T00:13:23,SpazztasticKiwi,I showed them a picture of Mark
14-09-2020T00:13:25,Dadrobit,"Fluorescent hair generally is not natural outside of anime, no."
14-09-2020T00:13:39,SpazztasticKiwi,“does this guy look like a redhead to you”
14-09-2020T00:13:50,SpazztasticKiwi,“oh no that’s not the man that was arrested”
14-09-2020T00:14:32,SpazztasticKiwi,it was right after Mark had redyed to his normal black
14-09-2020T00:15:46,Dadrobit,That can't be healthy for the hair to constantly be hit by chemicals like that.
14-09-2020T00:15:56,SpazztasticKiwi,"nevermind the fact you’d think I’d know or find out if someone I followed had been arrested for something predatory, I had to break out my own evidence to prove it"
14-09-2020T00:16:25,SpazztasticKiwi,he dyed it almost constantly for a couple years didn’t he
14-09-2020T00:16:27,Dadrobit,That happened with one of the other webcomics I was into a little while back.
14-09-2020T00:16:51,SpazztasticKiwi,pink to blue then the pool water turned it purple before he went red
14-09-2020T00:17:28,Dadrobit,Author totally shut down the site and all accompanying sites. Son was put on trial for pedophilia charges and killed himself.
14-09-2020T00:17:49,Dadrobit,Had to do a fair amount of sleuthing to find out though. Fukkin sucked.
14-09-2020T00:18:18,Dadrobit,Had been reading that comic for well over a decade.
14-09-2020T00:20:36,Dadrobit,"On the one side though, it also kinda felt like a kindness to put the comic down."
14-09-2020T00:21:38,Dadrobit,It started out incredibly strong with the protagonists winning through clever bending of the world's rules.
14-09-2020T00:22:00,Dadrobit,But later on power creep killed it.
14-09-2020T00:22:31,Dadrobit,"They introduced firearms to the world and it turned into ""whoever controls the guns wins"""
14-09-2020T00:22:46,Dadrobit,Really sad way to see it go.
14-09-2020T00:22:47,SpazztasticKiwi,sooooo...2020?
14-09-2020T00:23:24,SpazztasticKiwi,actually I have some real nice political jokes Ive found
14-09-2020T00:23:42,Dadrobit,The comic was set in a parody D&D world. So it was everyone else bringing swords to a gunfight.
14-09-2020T00:23:54,SpazztasticKiwi,one or two are from fb - friends and two of my cousins that I know aren’t racist trumpets
14-09-2020T00:24:10,SpazztasticKiwi,also there was a wasp in my bathroom
14-09-2020T00:24:11,Dadrobit,Hit me?
14-09-2020T00:24:14,SpazztasticKiwi,another one
14-09-2020T00:24:55,SpazztasticKiwi,do you know why republicans won’t impeach trump?
14-09-2020T00:25:18,Dadrobit,"Yes, but what's the funny reason?"
14-09-2020T00:25:19,SpazztasticKiwi,they believe in carrying a baby to term regardless of who it effects
14-09-2020T00:25:25,Dadrobit,Ayyy
14-09-2020T00:26:05,SpazztasticKiwi,https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/755267108862033962/755267138259779684/image0.jpg
14-09-2020T00:26:19,SpazztasticKiwi,what’s the difference between an officer and a bullet
14-09-2020T00:26:29,AspiringNoodle,"Okay, that one is pretty frickin' funny :ptv-laugh:"
14-09-2020T00:26:35,Dadrobit,That's an oldie
14-09-2020T00:26:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"when a bullet shoots someone, you know it’s been fired"
14-09-2020T00:26:51,AspiringNoodle,hahaha
14-09-2020T00:27:10,Dadrobit,"When a cop shoots one, you know it retires with full pension"
14-09-2020T00:27:18,Dadrobit,Someone*
14-09-2020T00:28:49,SpazztasticKiwi,some of them are line ups of trump quotes with hitler or quotes from philosophers of red flag verbatim
14-09-2020T00:29:15,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I see a lotta that as well."
14-09-2020T00:30:06,SpazztasticKiwi,a good example I wish some of my family would get through their heads is https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/755267108862033962/755277541660557373/image0.jpg
14-09-2020T00:30:40,SpazztasticKiwi,you can’t claim to represent an all loving God while being critical or hateful or hypocritical
14-09-2020T00:30:45,AspiringNoodle,Reminds me a lot of what my professor taught me in my capstone course
14-09-2020T00:31:21,AspiringNoodle,"""Beware the person who believes they possess the Truth.  People who believe they possess the Truth are capable of doing horrible things."""
14-09-2020T00:31:26,SpazztasticKiwi,the struggle is taking the “judge not lest he also be judged” and “love thy neighbor” gets me more than plenty an ugly look or opinion
14-09-2020T00:32:10,AspiringNoodle,"I'm paraphrasing, of course.  But look back at the dark ages / crusades"
14-09-2020T00:32:13,Dadrobit,"Maga folk have idolized Trump as the new messiah, they read that image, Spazz and immediately think it's about the ""Deep State"" trying to bring him down."
14-09-2020T00:32:18,SpazztasticKiwi,you cannot tell your children or relatives they can tell you anything with no fear and then turn around and gossip or criticize anyone
14-09-2020T00:32:32,SpazztasticKiwi,lgbt or minorities
14-09-2020T00:33:07,SpazztasticKiwi,said children won’t tell your hypocritical ass A Thing - I speak from experience
14-09-2020T00:34:17,SpazztasticKiwi,my mother tried telling me she wanted me to stop watching Mark because he “swore too much” & I looked her dead in the eye and told her she has to stop watching the walking dead with that sort of logic
14-09-2020T00:34:37,Dadrobit,"My mother is a ""both sides are just as bad"" apologist and my father utterly refuses to talk politics at all to keep the peace. But they're both kinda like that where FB is an open platform to tell everyone everything."
14-09-2020T00:34:49,AspiringNoodle,"hahahahaha, Kiwi, that's a burn center call right there"
14-09-2020T00:34:49,SpazztasticKiwi,she didn’t talk to me for days after that & I welcomed the silence
14-09-2020T00:35:43,AspiringNoodle,"I'm tellin' yah, 2024 is gonna be fun"
14-09-2020T00:36:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t care if she doesn’t like Mark or Seán or any of them but telling me to stay away from them or trying to keep me from them isn’t really gonna work
14-09-2020T00:36:19,AspiringNoodle,Assuming the nation doesn't implode before then and we must salute our Chinese overlords by then :ptv-laugh:
14-09-2020T00:36:42,AspiringNoodle,"...Okay, my brain is clearly fried.  I repeated a phrase :|"
14-09-2020T00:37:12,SpazztasticKiwi,she seems to have only noticed now that I have a rather funny and quippy side - I generally always have
14-09-2020T00:37:25,SpazztasticKiwi,but she has the impression I got it from them
14-09-2020T00:37:43,SpazztasticKiwi,like I can’t be entertaining on my own account
14-09-2020T00:38:54,AspiringNoodle,My state's about to get entertaining
14-09-2020T00:39:22,AspiringNoodle,Federal judge struck down the governor's lockdown orders
14-09-2020T00:39:54,AspiringNoodle,Interesting bit is that representatives from both parties were getting a little irritated with him
14-09-2020T00:40:44,SpazztasticKiwi,I live too deep in “speak English don’t you dare touch my flags and guns and bible but stay out of my country” south
14-09-2020T00:40:58,AspiringNoodle,I live in a swing state
14-09-2020T00:41:01,AspiringNoodle,It's fun :ptv-hearts:
14-09-2020T00:41:07,Dadrobit,"Arizona is desperately trying to hang on to that, Spazz."
14-09-2020T00:41:30,AspiringNoodle,"So, to elaborate"
14-09-2020T00:41:32,Dadrobit,Fucking traitor Confederate flags everywhere
14-09-2020T00:41:49,SpazztasticKiwi,people around here so damn narrow minded they could look through a needles hoop both both eyes
14-09-2020T00:41:52,Dadrobit,And giant pickups with bible verses and Trump stickers
14-09-2020T00:41:58,SpazztasticKiwi,with both eyes
14-09-2020T00:42:08,AspiringNoodle,"Business closures, stay-at-home orders, and size-limitations on indoor and outdoor gatherings are no good"
14-09-2020T00:42:18,AspiringNoodle,But capacity limits (25 - 50%) + masks are okay
14-09-2020T00:42:27,SpazztasticKiwi,today walking into work: van with two anti abortion stickers
14-09-2020T00:42:45,SpazztasticKiwi,plus a bikini girl outline sticker smack dab in the middle
14-09-2020T00:42:50,AspiringNoodle,LMAO
14-09-2020T00:43:08,AspiringNoodle,I had the abortion debate with myself long ago
14-09-2020T00:43:25,SpazztasticKiwi,the whole country needs they ass whooped with Jesus’s sandal
14-09-2020T00:44:06,AspiringNoodle,"I lean pro-abortion.  Mother must carry the child to term, and pregnancy isn't an easy thing.  Additionally, it presents a non-neglibible risk to the mother."
14-09-2020T00:44:44,AspiringNoodle,"While I sympathize that the child is indeed a person, completely forbidding abortion has the potential to put the mother's life at risk :|"
14-09-2020T00:45:17,SpazztasticKiwi,"if it’s because birth control failed or you didn’t try to use birth control, it’s a bit on you"
14-09-2020T00:47:14,AspiringNoodle,"Oooo, this article is good"
14-09-2020T00:47:25,AspiringNoodle,"""The court ruled that the gathering limits imposed by the state's mitigation orders violated the right of assembly. The ruling also says that the stay-at-home and business closure orders violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment,"
14-09-2020T00:47:28,AspiringNoodle,and that the business closure order violated the equal protection clause.
14-09-2020T00:47:36,AspiringNoodle,"The ruling says the process by which the state decided what businesses were ""life-sustaining"" and which ones were not was arbitrary. The state never settled on an objective, measurable definition of a life-sustaining business, according to the ruling."""
14-09-2020T00:48:08,AspiringNoodle,The last one I can first-hand verify
14-09-2020T00:48:23,SpazztasticKiwi,but saying she should be forced to carry even if it was rape or incest - if not both - or duress can kiss my ass
14-09-2020T00:48:33,AspiringNoodle,Casino / racetrack ~15 minutes from where I work.  That had to shut down months ago.  Meanwhile state lottery was still up.
14-09-2020T00:48:35,SpazztasticKiwi,that’s a personal choice
14-09-2020T00:48:39,AspiringNoodle,^^^^^^^^^^^
14-09-2020T00:49:03,AspiringNoodle,So guess where the casino regulars came after the casino closed? xD
14-09-2020T00:49:07,SpazztasticKiwi,"reproductive debates for women: no uterus, no opinion"
14-09-2020T00:49:29,AspiringNoodle,That is fair
14-09-2020T00:51:00,Dadrobit,Douchey caught flak from both sides when he announced his closure regulations.
14-09-2020T00:51:36,Dadrobit,"It boiled down to ""stay at home unless you want to leave. Also golf is a necessary business and must remain open""."
14-09-2020T00:51:38,SpazztasticKiwi,"I live in a state where if I got pregnant because my clothes said yes to a man louder than I said no, I’d be forced to carry it regardless of it being rape, making me sick, or me not wanting children"
14-09-2020T00:52:00,Dadrobit,"Fuck that shit, spazz. Fuck that all the way to hell"
14-09-2020T00:52:15,SpazztasticKiwi,make America great my whole ass

14-09-2020T02:14:11,Dadrobit,Is that a riddle though?
14-09-2020T02:14:59,Dadrobit,"It's more of a gag/prank along the lines of ""hey man, spell ICUP"" or ""Have you heard of updog?"""
14-09-2020T02:16:08,Dadrobit,"I was thinking there was more to it when you asked what hit noodle in the head, like you just cut off the riddle to ask if he was okay."

14-09-2020T02:23:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I called it a riddle so it’d be more likely to have someone fall for it

14-09-2020T04:32:27,CrimsonQuill,It happened last night too

14-09-2020T13:45:04,AspiringNoodle,A series called Nought + Crosses.  It's getting a TV adaptation on Peacock
14-09-2020T13:45:31,AspiringNoodle,Fiction exploring an alternate universe where Africa had colonized Europe instead of the other way around

14-09-2020T14:43:33,SpazztasticKiwi,so this is an open floor plan that anyone can get right
14-09-2020T14:56:28,AspiringNoodle,link?
14-09-2020T14:56:50,AspiringNoodle,or the fiction?
14-09-2020T15:14:32,AspiringNoodle,"ooooooooo, /s?"
14-09-2020T15:57:38,SpazztasticKiwi,is pepsi sweeter than coke or have I just drank coke more often that there’s a notable difference
14-09-2020T16:13:43,SpazztasticKiwi,pepsi 41g sugar coke 38g sugar

14-09-2020T16:38:36,K3IDRAN,but first  i need to know how the program works
14-09-2020T16:54:28,SpazztasticKiwi,ok anyone else here had grilled hibachi zucchini
14-09-2020T18:02:16,CrRAR,zucchini makes the lis in a surprising amount of cake recipes
14-09-2020T18:03:12,CrRAR,"it is surprisingly delicious cooked, different than carrot cake, but the same idea"
14-09-2020T18:05:22,RimaDraws,i just ate my dinner or at least half of it
14-09-2020T18:07:04,CrRAR,"half now, half later, better metabolically anyway"
14-09-2020T19:13:17,RimaDraws,i already finished it
14-09-2020T19:32:12,SpazztasticKiwi,🍚
14-09-2020T19:40:00,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m not a fan of well over half of the multicolor puzzle looking cars but doesn’t this guy lil look snappyhttps://media.discordapp.net/attachments/524825976597643265/755588565345501354/image0.jpg
14-09-2020T19:41:57,CrRAR,is that like a wood-grain pattern hood?
14-09-2020T19:43:23,CrRAR,it definitely doesn't look ramshackle though. Good taste in modifications.
14-09-2020T19:44:16,CrRAR,"Conveys ""I wanted it like this"" not ""Well, this is all the parts they had at the junkyard that would fit"""
14-09-2020T19:48:00,SpazztasticKiwi,how come america raided the world for resources & still can’t cook
14-09-2020T19:49:02,CrRAR,"eh, too tired from raiding all the resources"
14-09-2020T19:53:58,SpazztasticKiwi,raid world ✅ pick a fight with literally everyone ✅ steal all the resources ✅
14-09-2020T19:54:15,SpazztasticKiwi,decide you like none of them & make your own knockoffs ✅
14-09-2020T19:57:37,CrRAR,America is literally the embodiment of the upset teenager that ran away from home
14-09-2020T19:58:00,CrRAR,we kinda all relinquished our former cultures at the door xD
14-09-2020T19:58:08,CrRAR,or at least our ancestors did
14-09-2020T20:04:24,SpazztasticKiwi,ford focus
14-09-2020T20:04:30,SpazztasticKiwi,good or bad idea
14-09-2020T20:04:36,Ordithus,I have one!
14-09-2020T20:04:46,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-natsducky: hi
14-09-2020T20:04:59,CrRAR,"yeah, they pretty good"
14-09-2020T20:05:06,CrRAR,robit has one too
14-09-2020T20:05:13,CrRAR,hey ord!
14-09-2020T20:05:19,Ordithus,robit and I have older foci
14-09-2020T20:05:22,SpazztasticKiwi,"2013 $4,300 listed"
14-09-2020T20:05:33,SpazztasticKiwi,but there’s still money owed on it
14-09-2020T20:06:20,Ordithus,auto transmission?
14-09-2020T20:06:37,CrRAR,yeah that's tricky I guess cuz you have to make sure that the person takes your money and goes to the bank and clears the title to give to you
14-09-2020T20:06:38,Ordithus,price seems low
14-09-2020T20:06:48,CrRAR,maybe lots of miles?
14-09-2020T20:07:08,Ordithus,think I could sell my '11 with 108k for that
14-09-2020T20:07:21,SpazztasticKiwi,yep
14-09-2020T20:07:44,SpazztasticKiwi,auto 143000 miles
14-09-2020T20:08:19,CrRAR,yeah my oooold civic was worth like 3-5000 with I think 130000 miles or something
14-09-2020T20:08:57,CrRAR,"My brother had an 01 focus and he liked it, that model year was kinda janky though"
14-09-2020T20:08:58,SpazztasticKiwi,small maybe-got-too-close-to-a-low-guard-post scrape on the side
14-09-2020T20:09:55,CrRAR,"hmm, yeah you'd want to drive it listen for noises, rumbles, braking oddities or steering wheel wobbles"
14-09-2020T20:10:27,CrRAR,that model year was pretty sharp looking though I'm pretty sure
14-09-2020T20:10:35,CrRAR,I know the '14s were nice
14-09-2020T20:10:37,Ordithus,the auto transmission in any focus newer than '12 can be weird.  You'd have to drive it to see if it works well
14-09-2020T20:10:54,Ordithus,there was a recall on it
14-09-2020T20:11:05,Ordithus,but otherwise they are pretty solid
14-09-2020T20:11:27,CrRAR,"yeah, for some reason good transmissions are like an art these days"
14-09-2020T20:11:39,AspiringNoodle,"I know what you guys mean, haha"
14-09-2020T20:11:51,SpazztasticKiwi,https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/524825976597643265/755596716715016332/image0.png
14-09-2020T20:11:54,AspiringNoodle,The transmission can be a bit wonky in some pullout scenarios
14-09-2020T20:11:57,SpazztasticKiwi,literally the only flaw
14-09-2020T20:12:00,CrRAR,"even in the asian cars, transmissions are not even their strongsuit"
14-09-2020T20:12:01,AspiringNoodle,Like it can't make up its mind on what it wants to do
14-09-2020T20:12:06,CrRAR,lol
14-09-2020T20:12:44,AspiringNoodle,"Not joking, though"
14-09-2020T20:12:46,Ordithus,that's not so bad
14-09-2020T20:13:11,Ordithus,a bit of paint would keep that from rusting at least
14-09-2020T20:13:16,AspiringNoodle,"It happens elsewhere, but primarily on the hill to come home.  Depending on how fast I start going up and how hard I'm accelerating, the transmission won't deliver steady power."
14-09-2020T20:13:36,Ordithus,"what car, noodle?"
14-09-2020T20:13:41,AspiringNoodle,2014 focus :P
14-09-2020T20:14:00,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
14-09-2020T20:14:02,AspiringNoodle,"Y'all've heard of the ABS feature, but I've got the AFS system"
14-09-2020T20:14:14,SpazztasticKiwi,but why so cheap when it’s still new
14-09-2020T20:14:19,Ordithus,"miles, damage"
14-09-2020T20:14:29,SpazztasticKiwi,& not paid off
14-09-2020T20:14:32,Ordithus,but would def look for mechanical issues
14-09-2020T20:14:35,AspiringNoodle,^
14-09-2020T20:14:42,AspiringNoodle,The car itself may be part of a troubled production
14-09-2020T20:15:02,AspiringNoodle,Not all cars hold their value well
14-09-2020T20:15:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"like, there’s pictures of the inside and out but it smells like a “I buried a body with this car - take it”"
14-09-2020T20:15:25,AspiringNoodle,Private sale?
14-09-2020T20:15:29,SpazztasticKiwi,yep
14-09-2020T20:15:42,AspiringNoodle,"Could also be a case of ""we need money asap"""
14-09-2020T20:16:08,AspiringNoodle,"Take w/e money they can get, buy a junker, use the rest to pay off critical bills"
14-09-2020T20:17:30,SpazztasticKiwi,"either they don’t know what they’re selling, it’s a part of a crime, or they have more money than logical sense and that little scratch threw off their aura so they gotta replace it/they got bored of it"
14-09-2020T20:18:05,SpazztasticKiwi,but if I can’t see what I’ll be taking up for payments I don’t want it
14-09-2020T20:18:13,SpazztasticKiwi,they could be close to repo

14-09-2020T20:20:33,K3IDRAN,So i just accepted my female body from my surgery a few days ago
14-09-2020T20:22:12,SpazztasticKiwi,there was a truck for about as cheap today too “won’t crank - don’t know what to do - $3500”
14-09-2020T20:22:16,Ordithus,hatchback! nice

14-09-2020T20:23:12,K3IDRAN,Yeah
14-09-2020T20:23:23,CrRAR,"also about the windows shaded spazz, could not be, but might have those because smoker owner"
14-09-2020T20:23:59,K3IDRAN,smokes
14-09-2020T20:24:08,SpazztasticKiwi,the black guards on the outside?
14-09-2020T20:24:33,SpazztasticKiwi,they’re supposed to keep rain out if you crack your windows
14-09-2020T20:24:47,CrRAR,"yeah hose dealies, I'd say it's either a smoker or the person REALLY cares, it goes either direction"
14-09-2020T20:24:52,CrRAR,*those
14-09-2020T20:25:15,Ordithus,"missing a piece on the bottom of the front bumper, right side"
14-09-2020T20:25:21,SpazztasticKiwi,they’re useful so you can let your car vent in a boiling parking lot
14-09-2020T20:25:29,K3IDRAN,I still wanna be known as a guy
14-09-2020T20:25:31,K3IDRAN,Agreed
14-09-2020T20:25:56,CrRAR,"Maybe in warmer climates they're more frequent, yeah because of the heat, sounds reasonable"
14-09-2020T20:26:28,SpazztasticKiwi,windows can take heat but it can still bust the glass out in the sun
14-09-2020T20:26:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I do t see a missing anything
14-09-2020T20:27:00,AspiringNoodle,nice hatchback
14-09-2020T20:27:03,SpazztasticKiwi,the car has no accident reports
14-09-2020T20:27:18,CrRAR,"My brother's was that color white, classiq"
14-09-2020T20:30:05,Ordithus,if it's missing you won't see it :cw0lfmare-KiaHalo:
14-09-2020T20:30:18,SpazztasticKiwi,that’s the thing
14-09-2020T20:30:25,SpazztasticKiwi,nothing is notably missing
14-09-2020T20:30:54,SpazztasticKiwi,the front maybe looks like the black strip the rest of the car has at the bottom is off
14-09-2020T20:31:01,Ordithus,price is definitely on the low side.  may be worth checking out
14-09-2020T20:31:20,SpazztasticKiwi,test drive it right by the police station
14-09-2020T20:31:29,SpazztasticKiwi,“check this for crime reports”
14-09-2020T20:31:43,Ordithus,lol
14-09-2020T20:32:14,SpazztasticKiwi,also I hope the surgery thing isn’t a joke there
14-09-2020T20:32:48,SpazztasticKiwi,honestly I couldn’t see myself getting anything done in a hospital in this year
14-09-2020T20:33:09,SpazztasticKiwi,I have suspicions using the atm
14-09-2020T20:33:22,CrRAR,lol
14-09-2020T20:33:30,SpazztasticKiwi,“how can I touch this telepathically?”
14-09-2020T20:33:41,CrRAR,sometimes I poke at the ATM keys w/ another credit card
14-09-2020T20:34:06,CrRAR,the touchscreens are another story

14-09-2020T20:34:36,SpazztasticKiwi,you could stage a crime with the dna on those things
14-09-2020T20:35:08,CrRAR,I guess bringing a wipey would work
14-09-2020T20:36:45,SpazztasticKiwi,kerosene is a disinfectant
14-09-2020T20:41:55,SpazztasticKiwi,would you say the focus is about like the equinox
14-09-2020T20:47:41,Ordithus,in general no
14-09-2020T20:57:18,SpazztasticKiwi,also came across a house for the bathroom routine obsessed
14-09-2020T20:58:51,SpazztasticKiwi,"master bath has double barrel sink, tub big enough for 2 people at once & a shower with two seating platforms"

14-09-2020T21:03:51,CrRAR,is google accurate in being sinks on literal barrels?
14-09-2020T21:06:10,SpazztasticKiwi,and before there’s a come t about couples showering together it’s not that

14-09-2020T22:17:20,BlackjackSec99,Fluttershy tearing apart a deathclaw with an MP5
14-09-2020T22:37:36,AspiringNoodle,"No, gaming Hell is Dark Souls 3: Ascended"
14-09-2020T22:38:17,AspiringNoodle,Chasethebro is doing a playthrough of it
14-09-2020T22:38:23,AspiringNoodle,He gettin' his butt whooped :ptv-laugh:

14-09-2020T22:42:28,K3IDRAN,It's legit Hell
14-09-2020T22:43:32,AspiringNoodle,Or the airplane mission from one of the MW titles
14-09-2020T22:43:39,AspiringNoodle,Haven't tried beating it yet
14-09-2020T22:43:52,K3IDRAN,Oh dear lord

14-09-2020T22:47:33,CrRAR,"oh yeah, the mile high achievement was crazy"
14-09-2020T22:49:02,CrRAR,"there def was a rhythm you could replicate, but so many things were up to chance"
14-09-2020T22:49:09,K3IDRAN,I almos tbeated it on veteran Until some B*****d Killed me
14-09-2020T22:49:43,AspiringNoodle,I got fed up with the mission because it was seemingly impossible
14-09-2020T22:49:54,AspiringNoodle,"If I reloaded my weapons, I wouldn't have enough time"
14-09-2020T22:50:45,AspiringNoodle,"If I swapped out low weapons for ones on the ground, odds were that the one I picked up was  at 1/3 - 1/2 capacity, and I'd probably die before I could pick up another"
14-09-2020T22:50:49,CrRAR,you just had t keep running like a goof and using flashbangs hoping bullets didn't hit you
14-09-2020T22:51:15,CrRAR,kinda like how you deal with Halo 2 on Legendary in places
14-09-2020T22:59:06,CrRAR,"I remember at one point I got to the hostage part almost twice in a row  and was like ""yeah, this time I'll get it!"""
14-09-2020T22:59:17,CrRAR,...then did't
14-09-2020T22:59:42,CrRAR,...and it was probably a c ouple dozen more times before I got  it
14-09-2020T23:00:03,K3IDRAN,Damn
14-09-2020T23:00:09,K3IDRAN,well at least you got it
14-09-2020T23:00:12,CrRAR,it's incredibly unpredictable
14-09-2020T23:00:29,K3IDRAN,well at least you got cheats on cod4
14-09-2020T23:00:38,K3IDRAN,Infintie Ammo so fire away
14-09-2020T23:00:49,CrRAR,chaining all of the different sections together hoping a dude doesn't span and block a door or something
14-09-2020T23:01:09,CrRAR,yis
14-09-2020T23:01:39,K3IDRAN,I can sometimes feel the Darkness In me
14-09-2020T23:04:48,K3IDRAN,Waw on downfall is hard too
14-09-2020T23:05:10,K3IDRAN,Veteran
14-09-2020T23:24:08,Dadrobit,"Blah, new guy on the shift before me is turbo-lazy"
14-09-2020T23:24:28,Dadrobit,"""Wait, I have to respond to emails?"""
14-09-2020T23:25:25,Dadrobit,"Yeah, s'kinda why we have a dedicated communications terminal and twenty unread emails on the screen there..."
14-09-2020T23:25:55,SpazztasticKiwi,“no that’s to make you look more official”
14-09-2020T23:26:13,SpazztasticKiwi,how often do you get new guys
14-09-2020T23:26:28,Dadrobit,All the time
14-09-2020T23:26:56,Dadrobit,Security has an absurd turnover rate. Tons of folks quit within a week.
14-09-2020T23:27:41,Dadrobit,"Some make it a few months, but I can only think of three other people who have lasted a year here."
14-09-2020T23:28:15,Dadrobit,Even the account managers quit from this posting. 3 different guys in the last year.
14-09-2020T23:30:03,SpazztasticKiwi,*minnie mouse voice* it’s always great to meet new friends
14-09-2020T23:31:09,Dadrobit,At least this latest account manager seems to have a head on his shoulders.
14-09-2020T23:31:30,AspiringNoodle,High turnover rate = fundamental flaw with the occupation
14-09-2020T23:31:35,AspiringNoodle,"Don't @ me, lol"
14-09-2020T23:33:18,Dadrobit,At least my night crew has seem to have stabilized for the most part. Though I am actively looking to fire one of em.
14-09-2020T23:33:36,AspiringNoodle,"Btw, sympathize with the high turnover rate"
14-09-2020T23:33:54,AspiringNoodle,"AT the station, a lot of people we get in for training quit within 2 weeks"
14-09-2020T23:34:23,AspiringNoodle,"After that, most people quit within 1 - 2 months.  If they make it past the 3 mark, they'll be there for a while."
14-09-2020T23:35:07,SpazztasticKiwi,turnover has to do with management and will to work
14-09-2020T23:35:24,AspiringNoodle,"Or how far corporate has its head up it's own bum, lol"
14-09-2020T23:35:35,SpazztasticKiwi,~management~
14-09-2020T23:35:49,AspiringNoodle,"Like, I like my manager"
14-09-2020T23:35:52,AspiringNoodle,But corporate can suck it
14-09-2020T23:37:25,AspiringNoodle,"Btw, how's work Kiwi?"
14-09-2020T23:37:37,AspiringNoodle,Lose any dummies in your dept?
14-09-2020T23:40:01,Dadrobit,"Unfortunately, it's also sometimes our clients who get guards fired."
14-09-2020T23:40:27,Dadrobit,Some of them openly admit they've made a game of fucking with the guards.
14-09-2020T23:40:40,AspiringNoodle,"Oh geeze, stupid stuff like, ""I don't like the way he looked at me, time to make stuff up and get them fired."""
14-09-2020T23:40:45,AspiringNoodle,Right?
14-09-2020T23:41:48,Dadrobit,Depends. Sometimes it's slander like calling someone a homewrecker and sometimes it's just outright derogatory name calling.
14-09-2020T23:42:57,Dadrobit,"Do it enough, and guards just crumble under the pressure."
14-09-2020T23:43:11,AspiringNoodle,"Confirmed, rich people are walking garbage and deserve any bad things that happen >_>"
14-09-2020T23:43:41,AspiringNoodle,"(the actual a-holes, I mean)"
14-09-2020T23:43:55,Dadrobit,I once got called in to find a broken window and missing guard because she threw one of the iPads through it and abandoned her post after one nasty confrontation.
14-09-2020T23:44:49,Dadrobit,:/ 98% of my residents and exceptionally cool people. Just that las 2% ruin a lot of shit
14-09-2020T23:44:59,AspiringNoodle,"Yah see, it's shit like that that isn't helping the #EatTheRich movement"
14-09-2020T23:45:29,AspiringNoodle,"And because they don't get called out on it in any meaningful way, it makes the rest of them look just as bad"
14-09-2020T23:48:19,AspiringNoodle,"Now I'm curious, do people in the neighborhood you guard have gatherings or anything like that?"
14-09-2020T23:48:45,Dadrobit,"Hell yeah, they get their own music festivals."
14-09-2020T23:49:04,Dadrobit,"Not recently with Covid, but normally very much yes."
14-09-2020T23:49:08,AspiringNoodle,Anything smaller to the point where the a-holes don't get invited?
14-09-2020T23:49:24,AspiringNoodle,"Like, ""You guys are the fucking worst and aren't invited. Ever."""
14-09-2020T23:49:35,Dadrobit,Fuck if I know.
14-09-2020T23:49:54,Dadrobit,"I'm just a guard, not a butler."
14-09-2020T23:50:01,AspiringNoodle,Would make me feel better if I knew that the people who harass the guards are also the ones ostracized by the neighbors xD
14-09-2020T23:50:40,AspiringNoodle,And I do honestly want them to get a reality check before the worst outcome happens
14-09-2020T23:50:51,AspiringNoodle,Never know who you're gonna piss off one of these days.
14-09-2020T23:50:59,Dadrobit,"Only one that I know of. Other residents will talk shit about him pretty freely, but I know he still goes to stuff."
14-09-2020T23:51:26,Dadrobit,"And fun fact, you probably know this person's name!"
14-09-2020T23:52:23,Dadrobit,"Don't meet your hero's kids, even exceptional people can be quite the asshole."
14-09-2020T23:52:46,AspiringNoodle,Now I'm curious
14-09-2020T23:53:05,Dadrobit,:D
14-09-2020T23:53:41,Dadrobit,Legit can't say. Under an NDA.
14-09-2020T23:53:57,AspiringNoodle,"Damn.  So even if I guess right, you can't say, lol"
14-09-2020T23:54:09,AspiringNoodle,"Because if this list is to be believed, I have 3 guesses"
14-09-2020T23:56:25,Dadrobit,"Yup, the money I make is way to damn good to fuck over because of some shit talking."
14-09-2020T23:56:37,Dadrobit,"So no, you will never know."
14-09-2020T23:56:55,Dadrobit,But I am moderately curious about who you think AZ hero's are.
