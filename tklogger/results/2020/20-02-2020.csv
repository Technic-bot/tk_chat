20-02-2020T15:17:14,AspiringNoodle,I'm reading some reddit threads about best buy

20-02-2020T15:17:57,AspiringNoodle,"why?  Because I actually know sh*t about hardware, maybe a bit about software, and wouldn't try to eff over people with stuff they don't need"
20-02-2020T15:18:13,AspiringNoodle,"Case in point, my computer that I built is really overpriced."
20-02-2020T15:18:40,AspiringNoodle,"But I chose to make those purchases, and I know where the best perf / $ is at and that's what I recommend to people."
20-02-2020T15:19:43,AspiringNoodle,Case in points: 32GB 3600 CL16 RAM and 2TB Gen 4 PCI-E m.2.
20-02-2020T15:20:34,AspiringNoodle,"Gaming rig, 16GB will suffice, 8GB for basic machine.  3000 CL16 ram will be a fair bit cheaper and is the point where diminishing returns occurs for ryzen processors"
20-02-2020T15:21:10,AspiringNoodle,And my storage has no practical purpose unless you are working with / transferring large files.

20-02-2020T16:34:09,TerraTheWizard,i believe that's a bug with the removal of the nora card tier
20-02-2020T16:34:28,TerraTheWizard,"the posts tied to that are still tagged as the tier, but the reference doesn't exist"
20-02-2020T16:35:11,mingun,"But this message appears only today, and Nora Card tier remove a two month ago‚Ä¶"
20-02-2020T16:35:26,TerraTheWizard,patreon updating backend stuff probably
20-02-2020T16:35:27,iliar,But there is not a single post for  Nora Card tier
20-02-2020T16:38:00,mingun,"IIs this message see only by me, or does someone else also have it?"
20-02-2020T16:40:13,TerraTheWizard,i see it too

20-02-2020T16:42:22,iliar,I find out what these posts are.
20-02-2020T16:43:31,iliar,These are posts for voting for suggestions. They have a SQUIRRELY SUPPORT tier
20-02-2020T16:44:31,iliar,They must be available to higher tiers. But for unknown reason they are hidden
20-02-2020T16:44:58,TerraTheWizard,weird
20-02-2020T16:46:00,mingun,"No, they all availible for me."
20-02-2020T16:46:14,mingun,"So, may be bug in Patreon."
20-02-2020T16:46:45,iliar,I think it's just a patreon glitch
20-02-2020T16:46:55,Twokinds,Must be a bug. Patreon has them all the time.
20-02-2020T16:47:17,Twokinds,They're always tweaking things.
20-02-2020T16:48:25,iliar,"When i click ""raise your pledge"" patreon offers me to change my higher tier to SQUIRRELY SUPPORT tier"
20-02-2020T16:48:49,iliar,This is stupid. I think they will fix it soon.
20-02-2020T16:54:12,iliar,"In a discord, people love the command to request a random picture. I don't understand why this stupid command is so popular. But it has been used 70+ thousand times."

20-02-2020T21:24:06,Ordithus,"Both are working fine for me, not even that much delay"

20-02-2020T21:28:03,BadFoMo,Acadentally Alt-F4ing (ment to F5) and relanching FireFox fixed it; for a few seconds. Now it's back to the way I described.
20-02-2020T21:28:52,Ordithus,Have you tried switching the tech to from HLS to MP4 or the other way round?

20-02-2020T21:41:43,kiabugboy,I'm imagining all the patrons making a bloodpact and each suggesting page remakes
20-02-2020T21:41:49,CrimsonHelsing,A remaster maybe
20-02-2020T21:41:59,Mediawatcher,Maybe physical form
20-02-2020T21:42:00,CrRAR,everything old is new again
20-02-2020T21:42:06,CrimsonHelsing,But that'd be a far future project
20-02-2020T21:42:17,KeefMcDerpface,hello
20-02-2020T21:42:19,Mediawatcher,And I think it would put too much pressure on tom

20-02-2020T21:43:00,ThingsAreMoving,I got a notification from Picarto that Tom has made a recording of his stream 15 minutes ago. There might be some problems with getting the vod from this stream.
20-02-2020T21:43:19,Ordithus,got the same thing
20-02-2020T21:43:23,Twokinds,Hm...

20-02-2020T23:01:35,Ordithus,no stupid sexy sythe for you
20-02-2020T23:01:43,JeremySenpai,:cjeremysenpai-ew: whats wrong sage
20-02-2020T23:02:09,SageSaga,tomato sauce turns me into a acid volcano from where only pain and acid flows
20-02-2020T23:02:15,HeresyArtStream,What about white pizza?
20-02-2020T23:02:23,SageSaga,thats not real pizza
20-02-2020T23:02:23,Ordithus,That seems... unpleasant
20-02-2020T23:02:25,BadFoMo,Dang.
20-02-2020T23:02:28,Dadrobit,I figured Tom would do something like catch him mid sentence in some arcane dadaist soliloquy loosely tied to diplomacy.
20-02-2020T23:02:36,PurpleLemons,what about a tomato on bread :snail:
20-02-2020T23:02:52,SageSaga,freakn Ketchup does it man- anything with enough tomato
20-02-2020T23:02:56,Dadrobit,"Also, that was a fun sentence to write"
20-02-2020T23:02:57,SageSaga,even some BBQ sauces
20-02-2020T23:03:11,HeresyArtStream,I can't have normal pizza because keto. I did find a good mix for low-carb pizza crust a while ago and it's become a nice escape.
20-02-2020T23:03:13,Ordithus,just plain ol' tomato?
20-02-2020T23:03:19,Dadrobit,GERD yo
20-02-2020T23:03:32,SageSaga,even just tomato
20-02-2020T23:03:36,HeresyArtStream,"There's no such thing as being unable to have pizza, you just gotta make it in a way that's agreeable for what you can eat."
20-02-2020T23:03:47,HeresyArtStream,White pizza with chicken and brocolli is nice
20-02-2020T23:03:51,HeresyArtStream,And clams casino is a classic
20-02-2020T23:04:21,Dadrobit,white pizza with chicken and broccoli just sounds like a deconstructed pot pie.
20-02-2020T23:04:34,Dadrobit,throw in some carrots and you're there
20-02-2020T23:05:02,SageSaga,"""Im sorry you cannot eat pizza- can I recommend terrible pizza?"""
20-02-2020T23:05:22,Roughlandin,Pesto pizza pretty :fire:
20-02-2020T23:05:44,Ordithus,The best pizza is pizza that doesn't make you asplode
20-02-2020T23:05:46,FlyAlpaca,Taffy?
20-02-2020T23:05:51,Kynum,Taffy.
20-02-2020T23:05:52,BadFoMo,What about Breakfast or Dessert Pizza?
20-02-2020T23:06:05,Roughlandin,dessert pizza is just pie
20-02-2020T23:06:19,SageSaga,i also have to limit bread- so also a limiter on pizza options
20-02-2020T23:06:32,Kynum,"oh. I was like ""...is that just really dry pizza?"""
20-02-2020T23:06:37,BadFoMo,...****.
20-02-2020T23:06:47,unsteddyphoenix,Idk man some exploding pizza is pretty good
20-02-2020T23:06:50,Roughlandin,It sounds like you just need to stuff pepperonis in your mouth
20-02-2020T23:07:12,Nekonny,Hum
20-02-2020T23:07:24,Roughlandin,NOT LIKE THAT THO!
20-02-2020T23:07:24,Dadrobit,pepperoni would likely fuck him up as well.
20-02-2020T23:07:27,Tharkis,hrm?
20-02-2020T23:07:27,Nekonny,I'm worn out today:(
20-02-2020T23:07:29,Dadrobit,that whole pepper thing
20-02-2020T23:07:42,Tharkis,dont overwork yourself !
20-02-2020T23:07:49,Nekonny,"Work, then entertaining my nephew,"
20-02-2020T23:07:54,Ordithus,"looking nice, Ron"
20-02-2020T23:07:59,Nekonny,been running around since 5am
20-02-2020T23:08:03,JeremySenpai,I'd say try worcestershire sauce but its probably a bit thin to make a good pizza topping on its own
20-02-2020T23:08:06,Nekonny,it's just adoodle
20-02-2020T23:08:06,Tharkis,"gah, get some sleep!"
20-02-2020T23:08:08,BadFoMo,Dang.
20-02-2020T23:08:13,Nekonny,but perhaps I can do more later
20-02-2020T23:08:19,Ordithus,nice doodles
20-02-2020T23:08:19,SageSaga,spicy food isnt actual a thing that generally causes acid problems
20-02-2020T23:08:32,Nekonny,unless taco be;;
20-02-2020T23:08:34,SageSaga,it just makes acid problems worse when you have them
20-02-2020T23:08:36,Tharkis,it can just make acid problmes worse when you do get htem
20-02-2020T23:08:46,Ordithus,this keeps happening
20-02-2020T23:08:47,Nekonny,jinx?
20-02-2020T23:08:52,Roughlandin,I'm telling you. Pesto chicken artichoke pizza is my jam
20-02-2020T23:08:53,Tharkis,:ctharkis-ewok:
20-02-2020T23:09:18,Kynum,I'd try it.
20-02-2020T23:09:21,JeremySenpai,:cjeremysenpai-tenor:Tharkis
20-02-2020T23:11:05,Tharkis,i love grilled chicken on pizza BUT
20-02-2020T23:11:24,Tharkis,i will fully admit any pizza with chicken on it does not re-heat well =(
20-02-2020T23:11:36,Roughlandin,Chicken doesn't reheat well in general
20-02-2020T23:11:38,Tharkis,impossible to keep the chicken from drying out
20-02-2020T23:11:45,Roughlandin,Exactly
20-02-2020T23:12:15,Roughlandin,Just means you gotta eat all the pizza in one sitting
20-02-2020T23:12:17,Tharkis,"pizzaria near me makes 2 awesome pizzas with chicken, and i love htem both"
20-02-2020T23:12:24,Tharkis,but i would SO over eat every tim i ordered it
20-02-2020T23:12:43,Tharkis,"one is grilec chicken, mushroom onion bacon and white sauce"
20-02-2020T23:13:01,Tharkis,the other is grilled chicken ranch dressing bacon and garlic
20-02-2020T23:13:05,Roughlandin,Fun fact: Crab/Lobster make surprisingly good pizza toppings
20-02-2020T23:13:26,Nekonny,"ok, I'm going to head off"
20-02-2020T23:13:33,BadFoMo,Bye.

20-02-2020T23:24:22,Twokinds,Stealing someone else's drawing of a twig and claiming it as your own.
20-02-2020T23:24:28,KeefMcDerpface,^
20-02-2020T23:24:33,SageSaga,not cheating- just wrong
20-02-2020T23:24:34,KeefMcDerpface,Now that's cheating.
20-02-2020T23:24:41,Roughlandin,Twig art is a competitive field
20-02-2020T23:24:48,Roughlandin,...Or is that forest?

20-02-2020T23:48:04,Roughlandin,Eh I'm saying everything is the same except the gender
20-02-2020T23:48:24,KeefMcDerpface,How about Felix?
20-02-2020T23:48:24,Roughlandin,So Tracey is still the amesiac former Templar

20-02-2020T23:50:33,Roughlandin,Natani and Zen are the same but their situations are reversed
20-02-2020T23:50:34,KeefMcDerpface,And Tracey Tiger Trace.
20-02-2020T23:51:10,Roughlandin,Natani is the older sister and Zen is the younger brother with half a female soul
20-02-2020T23:51:24,Ordithus,Natani is male in body and female in soul?
20-02-2020T23:51:35,KeefMcDerpface,There is a sketch of that actually.
20-02-2020T23:51:40,BadFoMo,"Trace: Flora, are you feeling ok? Flora: Yes, why? Aren't you enjoying this? Trace: Well, yes but... You're the /Grand Templar/! You hate Keidran! There are /horror stories/ about what you've done to them! Flora: There are?"

20-02-2020T23:52:13,Roughlandin,No Natani is still female. Full female. Zen is the one that gets cursed this time
20-02-2020T23:52:28,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-zenshocked:
20-02-2020T23:52:48,KeefMcDerpface,And I'm saying there's a sketch of that.

20-02-2020T23:56:38,Roughlandin,Eh. I'm still saying everything is the same but the genders. Except the Zen/Natani thing
20-02-2020T23:56:52,KeefMcDerpface,Okay
20-02-2020T23:57:58,Roughlandin,"Also Keith winds up with Zen, since the curse is reversed"
20-02-2020T23:58:36,Roughlandin,But Keith is also a girl. Keiko?
20-02-2020T23:59:11,KeefMcDerpface,"Heck, it would be funny if everyone changed and only Zen/Nat remember how things were before the change. But not everyone else."
20-02-2020T23:59:43,KeefMcDerpface,And of course they're still the same.
