19-06-2020T00:04:07,Combak,"Night Tom, thanks for streaming!"
19-06-2020T00:04:10,USNMM3,Guess I'll sit and stare at Yuki now. <3
19-06-2020T00:04:11,MatyMaty,"""Animals have no god!"""
19-06-2020T00:04:11,Roughlandin,...Sage reveals he's actually a vampire in 3... 2...

19-06-2020T00:04:24,KeefMcDerpface,^
19-06-2020T00:04:27,Ordithus,She's one of the Western Basitins Carver met
19-06-2020T00:04:31,Roughlandin,But she doesn't have an official name yet no
19-06-2020T00:04:48,Stormagedon,She looks like an Alex...
19-06-2020T00:04:51,SageSaga,i need to go to my sisters to take care of the dogs before i go to sleep
19-06-2020T00:04:53,Ordithus,she has the best paint :raised_hand:

19-06-2020T00:05:15,SageSaga,then wake up to run a stream
19-06-2020T00:05:20,beastlee99,What a fine wife she would be
19-06-2020T00:05:24,Roughlandin,...I'm kind of writing a fan fic that has turned into a novella about her...

19-06-2020T00:05:49,SageSaga,i try to go to sleep by 6am- but i usually dont fall asleep till 9-11am
19-06-2020T00:05:52,neocloud88h,Sage do you sleep?
19-06-2020T00:05:53,Roughlandin,He gets better... least in my brain
19-06-2020T00:05:56,MatyMaty,He nearly killed Nibbly too!
19-06-2020T00:06:02,SageSaga,then i get up at 3pm to run stream
19-06-2020T00:06:02,Ordithus,considering when you stream
19-06-2020T00:06:06,Ordithus,you don't get enough sleep
19-06-2020T00:06:25,Roughlandin,Pffft. Real stream lords don't wake up till 4pm anyway
19-06-2020T00:06:54,SageSaga,then i would be an hour late to my own stream
19-06-2020T00:07:07,KeefMcDerpface,:ptv-laugh:
19-06-2020T00:07:13,Roughlandin,Tom do it

19-06-2020T00:09:39,Stormagedon,"Wait, I think I lost my other Italy sock..."
19-06-2020T00:09:43,KeefMcDerpface,Oh oh.
19-06-2020T00:09:46,KeefMcDerpface,Uh
19-06-2020T00:09:58,Roughlandin,I took 3 semesters of spanish in college. I remember enough to have horrible conversations with my Ecuadorian friend about how hot cars are
19-06-2020T00:10:01,KeefMcDerpface,Wow. I cannot type tonight.
19-06-2020T00:10:17,Roughlandin,"It's that old buttchat magic, Keef"
19-06-2020T00:10:27,beastlee99,Ok serious question here
19-06-2020T00:10:31,beastlee99,What's a furry?
19-06-2020T00:10:35,Roughlandin,...Me.
19-06-2020T00:10:40,beastlee99,But like...
19-06-2020T00:10:42,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-floAAA:
19-06-2020T00:10:49,beastlee99,Is it someone with a fursuit?
19-06-2020T00:10:51,neocloud88h,That's too deep of a question.
19-06-2020T00:10:52,KeefMcDerpface,What?! Furries?! Where are they?! Answer me now!! Eugene?!
19-06-2020T00:10:53,Roughlandin,...Not me
19-06-2020T00:11:05,beastlee99,Or someone who wants to be an antrho animal?
19-06-2020T00:11:13,beastlee99,Or they like anthro art
19-06-2020T00:11:15,Roughlandin,I don't want to be
19-06-2020T00:11:22,Stormagedon,I'm the third one
19-06-2020T00:11:35,beastlee99,But...
19-06-2020T00:11:42,Roughlandin,I like anthro art and assume a beary persona online because hoomie me is awkward and ugly lookin
19-06-2020T00:11:44,beastlee99,Idk it seems weird to me
19-06-2020T00:11:56,Roughlandin,...Furries and weird are the same thing
19-06-2020T00:11:58,Roughlandin,Welcome
19-06-2020T00:12:01,KeefMcDerpface,I guess the *best* answer is all of the above(?). Let's just say there are different sub-categories.
19-06-2020T00:12:18,beastlee99,I'm like a moderate furry
19-06-2020T00:12:23,SageSaga,Furries are just people who want to identify as part of a community that enjoy anthro art and the culture it has created
19-06-2020T00:12:26,Roughlandin,"You are what you is, man"
19-06-2020T00:12:34,Ordithus,I like cute things.  Sue me.
19-06-2020T00:12:38,beastlee99,Same
19-06-2020T00:12:41,KeefMcDerpface,same.
19-06-2020T00:12:48,KeefMcDerpface,That's why I'm here tbh.
19-06-2020T00:12:55,beastlee99,Like it doesn't matter if it's human or what. If it's cute it's cute
19-06-2020T00:12:56,Roughlandin,I like cartoons... also porn. The two got all mixed up upstairs and somehow I wound up here.
19-06-2020T00:13:05,Stormagedon,Nat got me into TK... I saw random stuff on pintrest and I was so confused
19-06-2020T00:13:09,Roughlandin,Also I'm a bear
19-06-2020T00:13:32,johnnytho,"dang, so you like..."
19-06-2020T00:13:32,Roughlandin,I also like Maren. Who is not a furry but IS a cutie
19-06-2020T00:13:35,johnnytho,honey
19-06-2020T00:13:40,beastlee99,"That's slang for a huge gay person, right?"
19-06-2020T00:13:51,Roughlandin,...Wat?
19-06-2020T00:13:56,Roughlandin,OH!
19-06-2020T00:13:56,beastlee99,A bear
19-06-2020T00:13:57,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA: well this took a turn
19-06-2020T00:14:01,Roughlandin,Oh lol
19-06-2020T00:14:06,beastlee99,idk man
19-06-2020T00:14:15,SageSaga,bear is a slang for a large gay man
19-06-2020T00:14:20,unsteddyphoenix,He's right though
19-06-2020T00:14:20,KeefMcDerpface,ah
19-06-2020T00:14:22,beastlee99,yeah!
19-06-2020T00:14:22,Roughlandin,Haha! I get it now
19-06-2020T00:14:24,SageSaga,sometimes specifically hairy too
19-06-2020T00:14:43,Stormagedon,I must report a tragic loss................I have lost my other Italy Pizza sock
19-06-2020T00:14:46,Roughlandin,I guess I'd fit the label if I was gay IRL haha
19-06-2020T00:14:47,beastlee99,I learned that on twitter about a month ago
19-06-2020T00:15:11,MatyMaty,That has been around for decades
19-06-2020T00:15:12,Roughlandin,The things you learn online
19-06-2020T00:15:14,MatyMaty,XD
19-06-2020T00:15:15,johnnytho,A lot furries tend to be lgbt
19-06-2020T00:15:21,johnnytho,you learn stuff
19-06-2020T00:15:41,Roughlandin,I don't know where I fit. I find furry guys cute but most human guys are just kind of... eh.
19-06-2020T00:15:42,SageSaga,yeah i dont even think the term Bear is based on furry culture at all
19-06-2020T00:15:42,MatyMaty,supposedly the furry fandom started as a gay bear meetup
19-06-2020T00:15:52,Roughlandin,I definitely like girls though. Woof
19-06-2020T00:15:56,MatyMaty,in the early 80's
19-06-2020T00:16:04,Roughlandin,...Press x to doubt
19-06-2020T00:16:10,beastlee99,I'm about 70-30 girls-guys
19-06-2020T00:16:19,Roughlandin,It's a sliding scale
19-06-2020T00:16:20,KeefMcDerpface,"What about human Colin and Sythe, Rough?"
19-06-2020T00:16:20,johnnytho,Straight until within 30 yds of Keith
19-06-2020T00:16:24,beastlee99,LMAOOO

19-06-2020T00:16:54,Roughlandin,...Also Chris Evans
19-06-2020T00:16:58,Roughlandin,Also Chris Pratt

19-06-2020T00:17:07,Roughlandin,Also Also Jason Momoa
19-06-2020T00:17:11,johnnytho,"troubles, Sage?"
19-06-2020T00:17:14,beastlee99,So is Natani a trans guy and gay? Is that the official verdict?
19-06-2020T00:17:14,KeefMcDerpface,"That's good to hear, Sage"
19-06-2020T00:17:18,ZRO4825,"Oh, did you get it fixed finally?"
19-06-2020T00:17:21,johnnytho,Rough has a type i see
19-06-2020T00:17:25,beastlee99,jojos haha
19-06-2020T00:17:30,SageSaga,the driver was corrupt
19-06-2020T00:17:30,Roughlandin,"I don't think there's an official verdict, Beast"
19-06-2020T00:17:30,Ordithus,Natani is complicated and subject of so much discussion
19-06-2020T00:17:39,Stormagedon,"Beast, Have you read the comic?"
19-06-2020T00:17:40,Ordithus,Glad that got fixed Sage
19-06-2020T00:17:41,beastlee99,Yeah
19-06-2020T00:17:41,ZRO4825,"Beast, the verdict on Natani is we don't discuss it because it causes arguments."
19-06-2020T00:17:49,KeefMcDerpface,yep
19-06-2020T00:17:50,RimaDraws,This is good sage
19-06-2020T00:17:50,ZRO4825,And everyone thinks their own opinion is the only valid option.
19-06-2020T00:17:52,johnnytho,Im not gonna start a Nat argument
19-06-2020T00:17:53,Stormagedon,It does
19-06-2020T00:17:58,SageSaga,i blame Maty
19-06-2020T00:17:59,Roughlandin,I'd identify Nat as gender-queer. What matters is what Nat identifies themself as
19-06-2020T00:18:08,johnnytho,I agree
19-06-2020T00:18:11,MatyMaty,isn't Nat male?
19-06-2020T00:18:19,Roughlandin,"Biologically, no"
19-06-2020T00:18:19,beastlee99,Because it also says if the accident never happened to Nat she's be a girl but still tomboyish
19-06-2020T00:18:20,ZRO4825,I identify Natani as Magical Fuckery Afoot
19-06-2020T00:18:22,MatyMaty,and technically gay male?
19-06-2020T00:18:22,RimaDraws,natani is female who identifies as male
19-06-2020T00:18:27,KeefMcDerpface,Natani is a Nat. Nuff said.
19-06-2020T00:18:31,Stormagedon,NAT!
19-06-2020T00:18:37,MatyMaty,I mean what Nat identifies as
19-06-2020T00:18:38,Roughlandin,Agreed. Let Nat be Nat
19-06-2020T00:18:43,Roughlandin,"Yes, Maty"
19-06-2020T00:18:44,Ordithus,Also Natani will get all stabbo stabbo if you say otherwise
19-06-2020T00:18:57,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-smug: so best listen to the wolf
19-06-2020T00:19:03,RimaDraws,i mean i identify as non-binary
19-06-2020T00:19:09,Stormagedon,Mess with the Nat-o you get the Stab-o

19-06-2020T00:41:57,RimaDraws,i want to go back to B size
19-06-2020T00:42:12,beastlee99,"Another thing that's weird, Natani never interacts with Trace. I know there's a language barrier, but they're both main characters and nothing has happened between them"

19-06-2020T00:42:42,Stormagedon,"I also can't figure out the sizes, I just don't understand"
19-06-2020T00:42:54,Ordithus,Natani is technically supposed to still be spying on Trace.  Consider him... distracted :ctwokinds-natkeith:
19-06-2020T00:42:57,RimaDraws,think of this a b cup is the size of a orange
19-06-2020T00:43:06,RimaDraws,and a d cup is the size of a grapefruit
19-06-2020T00:43:31,Roughlandin,"I don't know how I know, but I know when I know, you know?"
19-06-2020T00:43:37,MatyMaty,Cup sizes don't work in art :P
19-06-2020T00:43:39,Stormagedon,"ok, that makes sense"
19-06-2020T00:43:45,RimaDraws,and sometimes its okay to not understand how it works
19-06-2020T00:43:52,Stormagedon,I get that
19-06-2020T00:43:58,Roughlandin,Anyway it doesn't matter. I don't care about big boobs or small boobs. I just like boobs
19-06-2020T00:44:05,johnnytho,Some of the art I see online are size Z
19-06-2020T00:44:06,MatyMaty,"Natani could be the same size as Chalo's mora in paper, but in visuals"
19-06-2020T00:44:07,neocloud88h,You like what you like.

19-06-2020T00:44:23,RimaDraws,i don't like anything above a D cup
19-06-2020T00:44:39,RimaDraws,erilas aka evals' sister is an exception tho
19-06-2020T00:44:40,Ordithus,Chalo likes to emphasize
19-06-2020T00:44:46,MatyMaty,Cups don't work like thaaaat
19-06-2020T00:44:51,ZRO4825,"Erilas, Tom drew her NICE."
19-06-2020T00:44:58,Roughlandin,"If someone deems me worthy enough to show me boobs, I do not judge the boobs. I go ""Ooh, Boobs!"" and I look at them and I love them because yay boobs!"
19-06-2020T00:44:59,beastlee99,Art that has boobs the size of the rest of the body weird me out
19-06-2020T00:45:00,johnnytho,Well I'm not a woman so...

19-06-2020T00:45:24,Stormagedon,"Deep rough, deep"
19-06-2020T00:45:40,MatyMaty,a huge girl with moderate breasts would have a bigger cup than a smaller girl with big breasts for her frame
19-06-2020T00:45:42,Roughlandin,It's all about proportions. Erilas got em.
19-06-2020T00:45:51,KeefMcDerpface,yep
19-06-2020T00:45:55,Stormagedon,yee
19-06-2020T00:46:15,Stormagedon,Its basic anatomy. Got to be balanced
19-06-2020T00:46:16,Roughlandin,"But Flora and Reni got em too. Different ones, but still... proportions"
19-06-2020T00:46:44,Stormagedon,I think Reni just forgot to add them. I think thats the joke anyway
19-06-2020T00:46:46,Ordithus,Reni is literal board.  Flora is in reality pretty average.
19-06-2020T00:47:05,RimaDraws,flora is practically a b cup at this point
19-06-2020T00:47:13,Roughlandin,A flat girl is fine too
19-06-2020T00:47:14,steelabjur,Reni doesn't like being top heavy
19-06-2020T00:47:18,Stormagedon,Wooooo B cup Flora
19-06-2020T00:47:19,Roughlandin,And Reni be fiiiiiine

19-06-2020T00:47:24,RimaDraws,reni is cute as she is even if she is flat
19-06-2020T00:47:27,beastlee99,Is StrikerWolfCat a regular here? I made this account to answer one of their questions but they weren't here today
19-06-2020T00:47:32,Roughlandin,"Agreed, Rima"

19-06-2020T01:02:53,neocloud88h,None of these vegan things appeal to me.
19-06-2020T01:02:54,MatyMaty,I just described what it is!

19-06-2020T01:03:02,SpazztasticKiwi,onision is not a safe man to be discussing
19-06-2020T01:03:02,MatyMaty,Vegan watermelon ham :P
19-06-2020T01:03:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"but yes, vegan honey"
19-06-2020T01:03:16,AspiringNoodle,"Would you happen to be discussing that one barbeque joint in, where was it, Washington state?"
19-06-2020T01:03:17,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s a thing
19-06-2020T01:03:23,Roughlandin,Huh... I guess honey ISN'T vegan
19-06-2020T01:03:29,MatyMaty,it isn't
19-06-2020T01:03:29,johnnytho,Thats F8cking STUPID
19-06-2020T01:03:33,Roughlandin,Comes from bees
19-06-2020T01:03:33,neocloud88h,I had Americanized Mexican food for dinner and it was good
19-06-2020T01:03:36,MatyMaty,it is made by bees
19-06-2020T01:03:44,MatyMaty,"thus, animal product"
19-06-2020T01:03:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"but like milking cows, “honeying” bees isn’t harmful"
19-06-2020T01:03:47,Roughlandin,Anything that is produced by animals isn't vegan
19-06-2020T01:03:49,Stormagedon,:bee:
19-06-2020T01:03:57,AspiringNoodle,Because there's a legit barbeque joint that's either vegan or vegetarian
19-06-2020T01:03:59,johnnytho,But...i guess. but whats the point???
19-06-2020T01:04:01,SpazztasticKiwi,is it “honeying”?
19-06-2020T01:04:04,AspiringNoodle,I seriously cannot remember it...
19-06-2020T01:04:05,beastlee99,Tex-mex may be my favorite type of food
19-06-2020T01:04:08,RimaDraws,milking cows? what?
19-06-2020T01:04:20,MatyMaty,Vegans believe you are stealing the bee's honey
19-06-2020T01:04:24,johnnytho,"Whatever, im not gonna get mad over food..."
19-06-2020T01:04:26,Roughlandin,I couldn't vegan. I'd be stopped by the vegan police in a week and stripped of my vegan powers...
19-06-2020T01:04:27,MatyMaty,just like the cow's milk
19-06-2020T01:04:31,Ordithus,milking bees

19-06-2020T01:04:45,SpazztasticKiwi,some vegans believe cheese is evil and milk is evil because it’s an animal product
19-06-2020T01:04:54,beastlee99,"I mean, bees are smoked out every time you harvest the honey"
19-06-2020T01:05:09,beastlee99,I'm not vegan but I understand where they're coming from

19-06-2020T01:18:09,Roughlandin,...I don't know the language of the youths
19-06-2020T01:18:33,SpazztasticKiwi,as long as I’m not hearing things

19-06-2020T01:37:15,johnnytho,I don't think chat in itself is very distracting. But sometimes ppl wanna tag the streamer or ask too many questions
19-06-2020T01:38:59,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s just a cheap joke
19-06-2020T01:39:13,SpazztasticKiwi,I know that chime but I can’t remember what it’s from

19-06-2020T02:18:15,SageSaga,but it really is asking a lot for people to accept it as a 16 year project from my horrible art and writing to my work today which is much better- but still needs work

19-06-2020T14:05:01,BadFoMo,"I mean, nothing much; you? (Got my genaric lines mixed up.)"

19-06-2020T14:08:12,AspiringNoodle,"Ugh, only got to survive one more horrible shift, and then it gets tossed in the trash where it belongs..."
19-06-2020T14:10:59,Ordithus,"restarted the computer and now windows is all like ""check out edge please"""
19-06-2020T14:11:05,Ordithus,nah
19-06-2020T14:11:13,AspiringNoodle,"ewwwww, IE 2.0"
19-06-2020T14:11:22,AspiringNoodle,Firefox all the way for me <3
19-06-2020T14:11:34,AspiringNoodle,I even gots this cool Dark theme :D
19-06-2020T14:12:01,Ordithus,"not getting any audio from you, sage"
19-06-2020T14:12:01,ZRO4825,Edge actually is a pretty decent browser.
19-06-2020T14:12:41,ZRO4825,"It's a damned sight better than Internet ""Fetching Firefox"" Explorer was at least, lol"
19-06-2020T14:14:16,AspiringNoodle,"Haha, so tru ZRO"
19-06-2020T14:14:38,AspiringNoodle,I just gotta jab it a bit since it's their latest attempt at creating a non-garbage browser
19-06-2020T14:15:24,AspiringNoodle,"Ironically, I didn't even use Firefox until I experienced it on an apple laptop in highschool"
19-06-2020T14:15:41,ZRO4825,"Honestly, Microsoft's been doing okay lately. Windows Defender actually does its job now in Win10, Edge is a competent browser."
19-06-2020T14:16:03,ZRO4825,"It's almost like Microsoft realized they need to fix their shit or something, lol"
19-06-2020T14:16:14,Ordithus,there it is
19-06-2020T14:16:16,BadFoMo,Sound!
19-06-2020T14:16:25,SageSaga,i dont know why that keeps happening
19-06-2020T14:16:30,ZRO4825,Suddenly loud anime noises @.@
19-06-2020T14:16:36,SageSaga,im legit just adding a new source of the same source
19-06-2020T14:16:55,ZRO4825,How odd.
19-06-2020T14:17:15,AspiringNoodle,*kawaii desu ne sounds*
19-06-2020T14:17:23,AspiringNoodle,"Also, I've been using Windows Defender exclusively"
19-06-2020T14:17:35,ZRO4825,So have I since I moved to 10.
19-06-2020T14:17:37,Ordithus,been doing that since win 7
19-06-2020T14:17:52,ZRO4825,"Win7 I didn't trust Defender at ALL, lol"
19-06-2020T14:17:56,AspiringNoodle,"I used to use Kaspersky, but I'll be honest, Windows Defender has been pretty darn good"
19-06-2020T14:18:06,ZRO4825,AVG during my Win7 days
19-06-2020T14:18:15,AspiringNoodle,"And I legit tried the shadiest sites I could to test it, lol"
19-06-2020T14:18:24,ZRO4825,lol
19-06-2020T14:18:38,ZRO4825,So you went to microsoft's home page? :P
19-06-2020T14:18:39,Ordithus,back in the xp days most of the viruses and such came from ads on major sites
19-06-2020T14:18:51,AspiringNoodle,"No compromised accounts, 0 threats any time I scan"
19-06-2020T14:18:57,AspiringNoodle,No wonkiness
19-06-2020T14:19:20,ZRO4825,"Honestly, I've had very few problems ever since I started running ad blockers and ScriptSafe extensions."
19-06-2020T14:19:29,Dakina,Ello
19-06-2020T14:19:35,ZRO4825,Heyyo Dakina
19-06-2020T14:19:37,SageSaga,yo
19-06-2020T14:19:38,AspiringNoodle,Part of the reason I started using Kaspersky is because I got tired of cleaning out viruses and the like from my computer from even the most milquetoast web browsing
19-06-2020T14:19:46,Hogan,Eveninges!
19-06-2020T14:19:52,AspiringNoodle,Haihai Daki :D
19-06-2020T14:20:08,AspiringNoodle,Remember the windows security spyware?
19-06-2020T14:20:12,Ordithus,"hi dakina, hogan"
19-06-2020T14:20:28,Hogan,Hiya Ordithus
19-06-2020T14:20:37,Ordithus,you mean the popups that looked like a virus scanner?
19-06-2020T14:20:47,AspiringNoodle,"Pretty much, lol"
19-06-2020T14:20:58,AspiringNoodle,It was the single most *annoying* piece of malware I ever had the displeasure of dealing with
19-06-2020T14:21:00,AspiringNoodle,Multiple times
19-06-2020T14:21:30,AspiringNoodle,"It made itself look like Microsoft software, and shut down just about everything claiming it was dangerous"
19-06-2020T14:21:58,AspiringNoodle,"I eventually coughed up for Kaspersky because the free trials were capable of killing it with fire, even on trial versions"
19-06-2020T14:23:26,AspiringNoodle,It was fun to deal with because the process was listed in task manager as a random 3-letter sequence followed by .exe iirc
19-06-2020T14:24:53,AspiringNoodle,"I was able to download Kasperky by manually killing its process.  And I had to kill it every single time I did something it considered ""dangerous"""
19-06-2020T14:25:05,ZRO4825,"aka, anything, lol"
19-06-2020T14:25:08,AspiringNoodle,Yup
19-06-2020T14:25:15,AspiringNoodle,Open a web browser? DANGEROUS
19-06-2020T14:25:21,AspiringNoodle,Do a search? DANGEROUS
19-06-2020T14:25:29,AspiringNoodle,Click dat link? DANGEROOOOOOOOOUUUUUUUUUUUUUSSSSSSS
19-06-2020T14:26:08,AspiringNoodle,The bright side is that the name of its process was determined when it got into your system
19-06-2020T14:26:25,AspiringNoodle,So it's not like a different process name popped up every time.  Could be eav.exe every time
19-06-2020T14:26:38,AspiringNoodle,Would*
19-06-2020T14:40:56,Ordithus,:eyes: such fancy pretentious clothing
19-06-2020T14:43:03,SageSaga,weird
19-06-2020T14:43:08,AspiringNoodle,Needs a smidge more pretentious :P
19-06-2020T14:43:19,SageSaga,my tablet is now trying to control my main screen instead of the tablet
19-06-2020T14:44:44,Ordithus,I didn't think graphics tablets like yours would do that
19-06-2020T14:45:37,SageSaga,it has an option called display toggle that lets you do it
19-06-2020T14:45:55,SageSaga,it just activated randomly- so i set it to a button so if it happens i can switch it back
19-06-2020T14:48:49,Ordithus,your tablet needs to figure itself out
19-06-2020T14:53:53,ZRO4825,It's just trying to be a strong independent tablet that don't need no artist.
19-06-2020T14:58:42,AspiringNoodle,"Artist: ""Work right or I'm throwing you in the trash."""
19-06-2020T14:58:48,AspiringNoodle,Tablet: :ptv-whiny:
19-06-2020T14:59:04,Ordithus,I think you have who has the real power here backwards
19-06-2020T14:59:10,ZRO4825,lol
19-06-2020T14:59:20,AspiringNoodle,Which one of us? lol

19-06-2020T14:59:50,Ordithus,the tablet holds all the cards
19-06-2020T15:00:34,Ordithus,well that was different.  Just saw someone speed down the street in a side-by-side atv
19-06-2020T15:00:35,BadFoMo,Tablet: You need me to draw.
19-06-2020T15:00:54,SageSaga,"""No, there is another"""
19-06-2020T15:01:15,SageSaga,i do have another tablet i can use but its a pain to stream from

19-06-2020T15:01:40,BadFoMo,That's what I use.
19-06-2020T15:01:49,AspiringNoodle,Big brain play: Become MODOK and paint with your mind
19-06-2020T15:01:50,Ordithus,"wise move, sage"
19-06-2020T15:03:15,SageSaga,if I had technomancy to draw with my mind i'd be doing animations and AI would probably be done already
19-06-2020T15:03:39,SageSaga,and i mean the whole series not this page
19-06-2020T15:10:13,ZRO4825,If we had that capability I might actually be a decent artist. :rofl:
19-06-2020T15:11:39,BadFoMo,"Haha, same."
19-06-2020T15:14:53,sunblaze,hihi
19-06-2020T15:14:59,SageSaga,yo
19-06-2020T15:15:02,BadFoMo,Yo.
19-06-2020T15:15:08,ZRO4825,Square-Enix put out a PlayArts figure of Y'shtola and I'm SO tempted :eyes:
19-06-2020T15:15:11,Ordithus,hi sun
19-06-2020T15:15:34,ZRO4825,"Sorry, Bring Arts, not Play Arts. I think Play Arts is a different category."
19-06-2020T15:15:47,ZRO4825,"Still figures, but still. Details are important sometimes."
19-06-2020T15:16:40,SageSaga,remember- if it's pose able- its probably trash
19-06-2020T15:16:45,BadFoMo,What is/are Bring Arts and Play Arts?
19-06-2020T15:16:57,AspiringNoodle,The exception being the really pricey posable stuff
19-06-2020T15:17:00,ZRO4825,Lines of figures from Square-Enix.
19-06-2020T15:17:10,AspiringNoodle,"That stuff is meant to be posed maybe, 2 or 3 times, and then stay like that, lol"
19-06-2020T15:17:15,ZRO4825,Roughly $90 posable figure in this case~
19-06-2020T15:17:26,SageSaga,i've seen really pricey poseables that also sucked though
19-06-2020T15:19:18,BadFoMo,"Dang. I think I'll stick to digital good, thank you."
19-06-2020T15:20:53,ZRO4825,"I pay close to that for most of my commissions, so not much different. At least I can touch the figure. :P"
19-06-2020T15:20:55,AspiringNoodle,Can't break if it ain't physical *taps forehead*
19-06-2020T15:21:01,AspiringNoodle,*computer bursts into flames*
19-06-2020T15:21:04,AspiringNoodle,...F*CK
19-06-2020T15:21:06,ZRO4825,XD
19-06-2020T15:21:24,BadFoMo,@AspiringNoodle FUUUU!
19-06-2020T15:21:31,ZRO4825,"Yeah, gotta admit that's one of my main fears when it comes to my digital stuff. If my hard drives decide to go kaput, I'm gonna be out a looooot of stuff, lol"
19-06-2020T15:22:02,BadFoMo,"That reminds me, I need to back sme stuff up again."
19-06-2020T15:22:07,AspiringNoodle,I'm at a somewhat decent backup state
19-06-2020T15:22:08,BadFoMo,*some
19-06-2020T15:22:19,AspiringNoodle,"Anything super important I also have on a flash drive, the rest can be downloaded"
19-06-2020T15:22:47,AspiringNoodle,"But if I wanted to be super sure, I'd also have a separate external hard drive enclosure that I only hook up to perform backups"
19-06-2020T15:23:15,BadFoMo,I use 4T external hard drives to back.
19-06-2020T15:23:19,AspiringNoodle,"And then as a backup for that backup, I'd also want that same stuff on the cloud"
19-06-2020T15:23:45,AspiringNoodle,"Coming from my capstone course, you want at least 2 backups, minimum"
19-06-2020T15:24:02,AspiringNoodle,With one being nearby but physically separated from the machine so if that goes it doesn't go with it
19-06-2020T15:24:09,BadFoMo,I only have the one.
19-06-2020T15:24:09,ZRO4825,Let's see...called off work for the day due to a busted leg (Charlie horsed calf muscle. So much FUN to wake up to.) Now what to play...
19-06-2020T15:24:12,AspiringNoodle,And another ideally in a completely separate location
19-06-2020T15:24:24,ZRO4825,"Work on FFXI stuff, play some more NFS Heat, or Satisfactory...."
19-06-2020T15:24:27,SageSaga,i need a quick break- gotta move around a bit - wake up some more- and get some water
19-06-2020T15:24:33,ZRO4825,"Otay, Sage"
19-06-2020T15:24:35,BadFoMo,Cool.
19-06-2020T15:24:48,AspiringNoodle,"As much as I want to, I am *not* calling off today"
19-06-2020T15:25:01,AspiringNoodle,This is the last day of this God forsaken monstrosity of a shfit
19-06-2020T15:25:21,AspiringNoodle,"And I don't want some coworker being roped into it, or somebody working alone for hours on end"
19-06-2020T15:25:52,ZRO4825,"Honestly, I could've NOT called off, but between the leg hurting, and being absolutely fed up with a lot of shit from coworkers, I kinda needed the day off. And it was a shorter shift today anyway."
19-06-2020T15:26:45,AspiringNoodle,"That's me, but either the manager or the company, I can't tell anymore"
19-06-2020T15:27:15,AspiringNoodle,They thought it was acceptable to move closing hours to midnight and make one 2nd shift employee go from working 1.5 hours solo to 3.5 hours solo
19-06-2020T15:27:28,ZRO4825,oof
19-06-2020T15:27:31,AspiringNoodle,"And I can guarantee that if we didn't find someone for the overnight shift, this would not have been the last week"
19-06-2020T15:27:38,AspiringNoodle,"So yeah, this company can suck it at this point"
19-06-2020T15:27:44,ZRO4825,"Can't argue that, jeez."
19-06-2020T15:28:04,ZRO4825,I personally don't think *any* job related to a store of any sort should EVER be a solo shift.
19-06-2020T15:28:30,Ordithus,buddy system
19-06-2020T15:28:48,AspiringNoodle,Work gets 2 more chances before I hand in notice before letting my parents know (the joys of still living with them)
19-06-2020T15:29:11,AspiringNoodle,I put in a vacation request for just a single week on the week of my birthday
19-06-2020T15:29:24,AspiringNoodle,"If that doesn't get approved, I put one more in a month out"
19-06-2020T15:29:32,AspiringNoodle,"If THAT one doesn't get approved, fuck this shit I'm out"
19-06-2020T15:32:10,AspiringNoodle,"Sorry for the swearing, just a smidge tired of work constantly pushing the boundaries of what we're able to put up with"
19-06-2020T15:33:02,ZRO4825,That level of swearing is pretty much nothing compared to what I do on a daily basis. :P
19-06-2020T15:36:38,SageSaga,back
19-06-2020T15:36:41,ZRO4825,wb!

19-06-2020T15:42:25,ZRO4825,I do not! =D
19-06-2020T15:42:28,Ordithus,neglected but yes
19-06-2020T15:42:39,ZRO4825,"Gave it up when I realized I wasn't watching a single thing on it anymore, lmao"
19-06-2020T15:42:53,SageSaga,there's a new anime movie on there called A Whisker Away
19-06-2020T15:43:02,SageSaga,good movie
19-06-2020T15:43:53,AspiringNoodle,KITTY!!! :ptv-excited:
19-06-2020T15:45:19,BadFoMo,What's it about?

19-06-2020T15:46:04,AspiringNoodle,I think she turns herself into a cat to get closer to a guy she likes?
19-06-2020T15:46:06,sunblaze,girl loves guy. guy is blind. so she uses magic to change into an adorable kitten. to let him pet her
19-06-2020T15:46:18,sunblaze,oh and maybe a lvoestory as well :P
19-06-2020T15:46:20,AspiringNoodle,...I see no problem with this <3
19-06-2020T15:46:45,SageSaga,i was surprised because usually its a super shy girl that cant express herself-
19-06-2020T15:46:55,BadFoMo,I am slightly interested in this.
19-06-2020T15:46:56,SageSaga,this was well done and a bit different
19-06-2020T15:55:14,sunblaze,sadly I require sleep. take care :P
19-06-2020T15:55:31,SageSaga,sleep well!

19-06-2020T15:58:52,Dadrobit,o/

19-06-2020T16:04:31,SageSaga,the girl does have a crush on him but also is trying to help him because hes having a hard time and she's been through crap too
19-06-2020T16:04:57,Ordithus,she can be his seeing eye cat
19-06-2020T16:04:59,SageSaga,they just deal with it differently and shes given the opportunity to learn more
19-06-2020T16:05:13,AspiringNoodle,Don't need to sell me on it
19-06-2020T16:05:25,AspiringNoodle,"She's a really cute kitty, I'm sold :ptv-excited:"
19-06-2020T16:05:34,SageSaga,im not trying to sell you on it- im explaining to Dadrobit
19-06-2020T16:05:52,AspiringNoodle,"Oh, that's simple then"
19-06-2020T16:06:01,AspiringNoodle,"Is anime, cute and weird go hand-in-hand"
19-06-2020T16:06:23,Dadrobit,"So. They're sharing a drink called misery, but it's better than drinking alone."
19-06-2020T16:06:38,Dadrobit,I think I'll legit check it out.
19-06-2020T16:06:44,Sclimshady,Ok piano man
19-06-2020T16:07:27,AspiringNoodle,I'm making good headway on my youtube backlog.  Won't be long before I'm binging animu
19-06-2020T16:07:37,AspiringNoodle,Especially after I unsub from some stuff
19-06-2020T16:08:23,SageSaga,the quality of the show was above average- kinda like Your Name or a Ghibli movie- but not quite on that same level
19-06-2020T16:08:42,Dadrobit,Been meaning to watch Your Name as well.
19-06-2020T16:08:49,SageSaga,Your Name is a must
19-06-2020T16:11:41,AspiringNoodle,Haven't seen that yet
19-06-2020T16:12:18,SageSaga,looks like yall have things to do
19-06-2020T16:12:20,AspiringNoodle,"Have you guys seen ""I Want To Eat Your Pancrease"" and ""A Silent Voice"" yet?"
19-06-2020T16:12:22,AspiringNoodle,:)
19-06-2020T16:12:55,Dadrobit,"I Want To Eat Your Pancreas was spoiled for me, can't watch it/"
19-06-2020T16:13:01,AspiringNoodle,DO IT
19-06-2020T16:13:16,AspiringNoodle,It's so good ;_;
19-06-2020T16:13:20,SageSaga,Mihari actually went through the trouble of encoding and compressing a copy of your name so we could stream it in the theater on Tower so we could watch it together
19-06-2020T16:14:02,AspiringNoodle,"That said, I do recommend A Silent Voice"
19-06-2020T16:14:07,Dadrobit,"For the reasons of the spoiler, I can't watch movies of that nature willingly."
19-06-2020T16:14:29,AspiringNoodle,"I'm still kinda mad at Regal, tbh"
19-06-2020T16:14:59,AspiringNoodle,"When I installed their app, you could choose an image for your digital card cover, and I chose the movie poster for A Silent Voice (it really is pretty)"
19-06-2020T16:15:14,AspiringNoodle,"But when I signed up for unlimited, it got defaulted to something else that I can't change"
19-06-2020T16:15:21,AspiringNoodle,I want my animu card cover -3-
19-06-2020T16:29:05,SageSaga,i figured out how the display toggle happened
19-06-2020T16:30:19,ZRO4825,Hotkey combo?
19-06-2020T16:30:34,SageSaga,theres an onscreen radial menu touch shortcut and display toggle appears right under my pen so i must have opened the menu and clicked it before i could see it
19-06-2020T16:30:43,ZRO4825,Doh
19-06-2020T16:30:48,Ordithus,sneaky
19-06-2020T16:35:32,AspiringNoodle,Been there done that
19-06-2020T16:37:47,AspiringNoodle,"Meh, almost time for work"
19-06-2020T16:37:51,AspiringNoodle,"Great work, Sage"
19-06-2020T16:39:35,SageSaga,take care Noodle- i gotta go soon even if im not done- gotta check on the dogs
19-06-2020T16:41:49,Ordithus,how have the dogs been
19-06-2020T16:42:29,SageSaga,smelly
19-06-2020T16:43:08,Ordithus,unfortunate
19-06-2020T16:43:33,SageSaga,i hate the smell of dogs- it makes me feel sick
19-06-2020T16:44:40,SageSaga,that said i dont hate dogs- i just prefer cats
19-06-2020T16:45:28,ZRO4825,"Cats rule, dogs drool."
19-06-2020T16:46:11,SageSaga,"one of the dogs definitely drools more, hes got a tumor in his muzzle"
19-06-2020T16:46:39,Ordithus,that's no good
19-06-2020T16:46:49,ZRO4825,:c
19-06-2020T16:47:17,SageSaga,they both have tumors all over- like i said- not in the best health
19-06-2020T16:48:23,Ordithus,yikes
19-06-2020T16:48:51,SageSaga,one has a mass under her skin that is like the size and shape of a tennis ball- it's creepy
19-06-2020T16:50:00,SageSaga,"""Make sure you put the lead on Dog A!"" ""How do I know which one is dog A?"" ""Oh she has a growth on her back - cant miss it"""
19-06-2020T16:50:05,SageSaga,well- they were right-
19-06-2020T16:53:39,Ordithus,very unhealthy
19-06-2020T16:54:19,ZRO4825,o.o;;;
19-06-2020T16:54:24,SageSaga,the growths are relatively harmless
19-06-2020T16:54:40,SageSaga,otherwise they would have them removed or - put them down
19-06-2020T16:56:57,ZRO4825,"My family's dachshund has a few too. Relatively harmless, but still creepy."

19-06-2020T17:00:00,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-rose:
19-06-2020T17:00:51,Twokinds,I've never seen the link not work before. I don't know what's wrong.
19-06-2020T17:01:10,BadFoMo,What do you mean?
19-06-2020T17:01:12,Ordithus,Just refresh the main page and it works
19-06-2020T17:01:14,Dadrobit,"Not sure how I feel about the little faces attached to the speech bubbles? Seeing the expressions of Flora is alright, but it feels weird, kinda out of place?"
19-06-2020T17:01:36,Ordithus,clicked again and it worked this time
19-06-2020T17:01:42,Ordithus,also o/ Tom
19-06-2020T17:04:42,Dadrobit,":/ We've seen it before though I think, but I can't remember where, s'gonna bug me lol."
19-06-2020T17:05:33,Twokinds,I've done it a few times before
19-06-2020T17:06:21,CrRAR,dat intricate frame
19-06-2020T17:06:23,BadFoMo,I'm missing something here. The link is working for me.
19-06-2020T17:06:25,Ordithus,Like heeere http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/1059/
19-06-2020T17:06:53,Twokinds,And here: http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/1085/
19-06-2020T17:06:55,SageSaga,byeeee thanks for watching- i gotta go
19-06-2020T17:07:02,BadFoMo,Bye.
19-06-2020T17:07:02,Twokinds,Bye Sage!
19-06-2020T17:07:07,Twokinds,Take care!
19-06-2020T17:07:11,FoxxTrotter,"C-yas, Sage. Thanks for the stream."
19-06-2020T17:07:12,Ordithus,"The page looks good, Sage!  Thanks for the stream!"
19-06-2020T17:07:31,Ordithus,Hmm 2/2 so far are Maren
19-06-2020T17:07:33,ZRO4825,"Take care, Sage ^^/"
19-06-2020T17:07:42,BadFoMo,"Also, I too like the painting."
19-06-2020T17:07:51,Dadrobit,"I think it's just kinda a disconnect of tone vs exposition presentation for me. Like, it's a very somber moment, I really like it. But then the face icons feel kinda ""comical"", a bit out of place in comparison."
19-06-2020T17:07:59,Dadrobit,Just my opinion though.
19-06-2020T17:08:58,Twokinds,Ok I can remove them
19-06-2020T17:09:02,Twokinds,I added them at the last minute
19-06-2020T17:12:29,Ordithus,I suppose I'll cut some grass.  Motivation is hard today
19-06-2020T17:12:44,zolstarym,"If the faces don't work, you could always put a slight orange tint on one of the bubbles and a blue tint on the other"
19-06-2020T17:15:32,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I was also wondering if the removal will cause confusion on who is saying what."
19-06-2020T17:15:57,Dadrobit,I think the first bubbles are obvious.
19-06-2020T17:17:06,Twokinds,It's fine.
19-06-2020T17:17:12,Dadrobit,"I don't think it actually matters who says Flora's second bubbles though, it's just kinda an observation both of them share."
19-06-2020T17:17:12,Twokinds,I think it's clear enough.
19-06-2020T17:17:18,Twokinds,Yeah
19-06-2020T17:17:21,Dadrobit,Yep
19-06-2020T17:17:32,Twokinds,"I was worried about it not being clear, but it doesn't actually matter who said it."
19-06-2020T17:18:06,Twokinds,"They're both kinda equally on the outside of information, since Trace doesn't have his memories."
19-06-2020T17:20:20,Azumachan,It's a really nice page Tom
19-06-2020T17:26:09,Mediawatcher,"Poor rose, how appropriate that the Nora cards for her was uploading right as this page came"
19-06-2020T17:27:56,Dadrobit,#Calculated
19-06-2020T17:29:14,Twokinds,Thanks!
19-06-2020T17:29:29,Twokinds,The next one's already almost done
19-06-2020T17:29:46,Twokinds,I'm trying to get ahead
19-06-2020T17:29:51,Twokinds,So I have more time to work on other stuff
19-06-2020T17:30:26,CrRAR,aww yis
19-06-2020T17:38:19,Xexanoth,The portrait looks really nice.

19-06-2020T17:47:00,CrRAR,yis
19-06-2020T18:05:38,BadFoMo,@Twokinds Remimber when you said that you were looking for ideas for short Voting Insentive comics? Would an idea/script be rejected if the submiter had uploaded it somewhere else first?
19-06-2020T18:08:10,Twokinds,I guess not
19-06-2020T18:08:10,CrimsonHelsing,Aw but I liked those emotes
19-06-2020T18:10:11,Xexanoth,I wonder if we'll now see some portrait sketch suggestions.
19-06-2020T18:10:11,BadFoMo,@Twokinds I think I /may/ have 2 short stories that could fit the bill; I just need to write them first.
19-06-2020T18:59:49,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-rose: love seeing a painting in the comic again
19-06-2020T19:22:09,SpazztasticKiwi,picarto finally decided to lad since 1

19-06-2020T19:47:08,Ordithus,I wonder if it is on netflix
19-06-2020T19:47:35,SpazztasticKiwi,there’s places you watch for free
19-06-2020T19:49:34,Ordithus,it is not on netflix
19-06-2020T19:50:49,CrRAR,"If it's Disney, chances are Disney's got it."
19-06-2020T19:51:08,CrRAR,unless they waiting on the rights or something
19-06-2020T19:51:33,Ordithus,can spend money I haven't already spent to watch it
19-06-2020T19:51:39,Ordithus,this is less appealing
19-06-2020T20:40:25,SpazztasticKiwi,🐇
19-06-2020T20:44:20,RimaDraws,I wish the flora pictures were kept on the bubbles ...
