01-06-2020T00:09:58,Dadrobit,Tl;Dr: doorbell still broke. No expectations of fast remedy from HOA who was okay with gated community having no functional gates for a month.

01-06-2020T00:16:47,Dadrobit,Then.... What did you miss?

01-06-2020T00:29:34,SpazztasticKiwi,might mess around n go to bed
01-06-2020T00:30:21,Dadrobit,Then you missed nothing really.
