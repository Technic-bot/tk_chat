12-09-2020T17:51:09,NezumiYuki,"I'd link my fanart of Mike and Kathrin here but, Tom might not approve due to borderline SFW so I digress.  :P"
12-09-2020T17:51:11,CrimsonQuill,But Raine looks best in Tom's style. No debate.

12-09-2020T18:03:08,CrimsonQuill,I feel that Clovis will find the manor too much even for him.
12-09-2020T18:03:09,Dragusthor,hi Soda
12-09-2020T18:03:10,NezumiYuki,Good Boi Brutus seems pretty talented!
12-09-2020T18:03:13,ProsePro7,I especially like their muzzles the coloring gives them a puppy look

12-09-2020T18:03:21,FenceEqualizer,For henchmen they sure stand out.
12-09-2020T18:03:23,Elosan,Brutus's speciality would be his Spinach Puffs ( I would how many will get the reference)
12-09-2020T18:03:25,Roughlandin,I called first dibs on Rom and Rem when they get murdered in a few pages
12-09-2020T18:03:34,Ordithus,Clovis - all his minions must be pretty and must be good cooks
12-09-2020T18:03:37,Stormagedon,"it makes me happy when people recognize me here. Means im a regular, which is always fun to be"
12-09-2020T18:04:03,ProsePro7,If Tom named them they should stay around for a while.  Hes not George R R Martin

12-09-2020T18:06:05,Brocade,I kind of misread it on the most recent page
12-09-2020T18:06:10,Brocade,I couldn't figure out what they meant
12-09-2020T18:06:21,ProsePro7,I still say Clovis will lose his memory and live with Brutus and have a family by the end of it

12-09-2020T21:25:06,Sclimshady,It did with Carver yes?

12-09-2020T21:26:45,vevans0009,I disagree with it
12-09-2020T21:26:50,hyneria,"well I guess they are ""keidran"" in the level that both are mammals?"
12-09-2020T21:26:53,BADBackgroundProductions,"Think about it, they are definitely not the same humans as humans in our world, just look at Trace!"

12-09-2020T21:28:06,hyneria,yeah
12-09-2020T21:28:11,totallynotTrace,i would speculate humans are not keidran because humans have a different mask than keidran

12-09-2020T21:42:38,w0lfmare,Most will probably say yes because he's shown in a sympathetic light
12-09-2020T21:42:43,w0lfmare,In the comic
12-09-2020T21:42:46,BadFoMo,@Twokinds No.

12-09-2020T21:42:58,unsteddyphoenix,Honestly I personally say no.
12-09-2020T21:42:58,Sclimshady,What makes a preson?  the body? or the mind?
12-09-2020T21:43:00,hyneria,Real trace is a genocidal necromancer
12-09-2020T21:43:04,FenceEqualizer,I still say ye cause current Trace is literally a different person cause of magic.

12-09-2020T21:43:31,CrRAR,yeah
12-09-2020T21:43:32,Roughlandin,I think the central theme of the comic is that everybody can change.
12-09-2020T21:43:33,vevans0009,He fightin it
12-09-2020T21:43:34,unsteddyphoenix,Plus wheres the justice for the victims if he walks around
12-09-2020T21:43:35,Werewing,I think we should just say the real Trace is a very passionate person...to a fault.
12-09-2020T21:43:37,Roughlandin,...Except Carver
12-09-2020T21:43:37,Sclimshady,"True,  but are they seperate people?"
12-09-2020T21:43:39,FenceEqualizer,True but current Trace is aware and doesn't want that side out.
12-09-2020T21:43:40,hyneria,the creepy dark dialog bubbles
12-09-2020T21:43:52,BADBackgroundProductions,"Yeah that’s another question that I’ve been asking myself, is magic in Twokinds really a good thing?"

12-09-2020T21:45:02,totallynotTrace,the usa legal system does have the ability to pardon a person if they come down with amnesia similar to Traces IF its provable
12-09-2020T21:45:09,NezumiYuki,"guys common... Trace is a symbol for humanity... There is both good and bad in him, and like anyone, Trace deserves a chance to make good of the bad hes' done. If we deny him that chance, it's like admitting as a whole, all of us do NOT deserve a chance"

12-09-2020T21:47:04,steelabjur,I feel the Trace we've come to know is a much different Trace than existed before his memory loss.

12-09-2020T22:35:24,BlackjackSec99,"Spazz brought up a point though, if Mark came in here and made it genreally known he was mark, it would cause issues for Toms stream"
12-09-2020T22:35:32,Roughlandin,I'm withdrawing from lack of butts
12-09-2020T22:35:32,ThePurpleKitty,"rough, addf in smirnoff vodka and you get me atm XD"

12-09-2020T22:37:40,Roughlandin,"Buttchat, Blackjack. Nuff said."
12-09-2020T22:37:42,KeefMcDerpface,"Every once and a while some folks join and ask Tom if he's Mark's brother. But they don't specify who they are talking to so me and some other folks just go, ""Me? Nope."""
12-09-2020T22:37:47,BlackjackSec99,good point
12-09-2020T22:38:39,ThePurpleKitty,"or maybe were all just people and some of us make it big in some way, but we shouldn't place each other on a pedacil."
12-09-2020T22:38:44,KeefMcDerpface,"""We don't have any brothers named 'Mark'."""

12-09-2020T22:39:46,ThePurpleKitty,dosen't matter if i was talking to mark or jack or anyone else i watch on youtube because they are all just people with lives and arent really any more special then anyone else
12-09-2020T22:39:50,Roughlandin,"If I told my irl friends I was a fake bear that spent his sundays watching Markiplier's brother draw furries and occasionally laugh at my dumb butt jokes, they'd think I was crazy"
12-09-2020T22:40:13,KeefMcDerpface,But are you crazy irl?

12-09-2020T22:59:31,ThePurpleKitty,"you reminded me tho, someone in town had a toyota hatch back from the 80's in great condition for sale for about 1500. was in amazing shape too and wish i could have gotten it"
12-09-2020T22:59:48,KeefMcDerpface,Toyota is not bad.
12-09-2020T22:59:49,Ordithus,"which is normal, rough"

12-09-2020T23:00:48,KeefMcDerpface,hehe
12-09-2020T23:00:52,ThePurpleKitty,i like cucumbers tho
12-09-2020T23:01:03,ThePurpleKitty,monches on dem
12-09-2020T23:01:06,Ordithus,not you kitty
12-09-2020T23:01:13,ThePurpleKitty,surrrreeee ;)
12-09-2020T23:01:22,Roughlandin,I like them... but I's allergic
12-09-2020T23:01:36,Roughlandin,Not to pickles though. Which is... weird
12-09-2020T23:01:49,ThePurpleKitty,wait really? i didn't know people could be alergic to cucumbers
12-09-2020T23:01:59,Ordithus,people can be allergic to people
12-09-2020T23:02:02,KeefMcDerpface,haha

12-09-2020T23:02:41,ThePurpleKitty,also thats not weird. the vinegar probably breaks down the part you are alergic to in the cucumbers into another chemical compound that you can break down
12-09-2020T23:03:00,SpazztasticKiwi,cats can be allergic to people
12-09-2020T23:03:10,Roughlandin,Yeah that's my theory. The vinegar denatures whatever compound I'm allergic to
12-09-2020T23:03:12,ThePurpleKitty,*gasp!*
12-09-2020T23:03:22,SpazztasticKiwi,there was a couple that took their cat to the vet cause it was losing hair & scratching

12-09-2020T23:04:06,SpazztasticKiwi,anything can be allergic to anything
12-09-2020T23:04:07,BlackjackSec99,Random Lurking Tom comment
12-09-2020T23:04:24,ThePurpleKitty,or it just chemically breaks it down into a different compound like how your body breaks things down. like the acidity in it acts like your stomach acid and turns it into some other chemical
12-09-2020T23:04:25,Roughlandin,Tom always lurks
12-09-2020T23:04:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom likes to play peekaboo

12-09-2020T23:05:43,BlackjackSec99,bragging rights? yes.
12-09-2020T23:05:54,ThePurpleKitty,"speaking of, i have always been amazed how our bodys are basically one big chemistry lab, constantly turning one chemical into another to process it more easily and then desposing of the chemical waste safely"
12-09-2020T23:06:06,Roughlandin,Everything is chemistry
12-09-2020T23:06:16,ThePurpleKitty,well yeah
12-09-2020T23:06:19,BlackjackSec99,I was in a 03 ford focus SVT doing faster laps than guys in Porsches and BMWs

12-09-2020T23:32:53,Kameloh,you'll need Minecraft Java 1.16.2 installed
12-09-2020T23:33:30,Ordithus,is it weird I've never played mc
12-09-2020T23:33:39,KeefMcDerpface,no
12-09-2020T23:35:43,ThePurpleKitty,yes?
12-09-2020T23:35:49,ThePurpleKitty,ohh no
12-09-2020T23:36:05,KeefMcDerpface,Also is that maze 2 hours? Or is that include some messing around?
12-09-2020T23:36:15,KeefMcDerpface,*does
12-09-2020T23:36:36,Ordithus,depends on how much you want to see
12-09-2020T23:36:55,KeefMcDerpface,So in my case...
12-09-2020T23:36:58,KeefMcDerpface,1 month.
12-09-2020T23:37:18,Ordithus,"that would be something, since it didn't take him a month to make"
12-09-2020T23:37:38,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-maddiessparkles: no hedge unturned
12-09-2020T23:37:48,ThePurpleKitty,should play it tho. its fun and can be challenging. like i've gotten lost so many times from traveling away from my home and then have either died or almost died or had a horse and diamonds and died and lost it all.
12-09-2020T23:38:19,Ordithus,is that how you sell a game? you die a lot? guess it worked for dark souls
12-09-2020T23:38:31,KeefMcDerpface,lol
12-09-2020T23:38:51,Ordithus,I've watched a few videos of it over the years.
12-09-2020T23:39:11,ThePurpleKitty,it gives it a real world feel for me because if your not careful you can get turned around in the landscape and get lost
12-09-2020T23:39:53,ThePurpleKitty,tho you can come out good from it too since you can find temples and such with treasure
12-09-2020T23:45:35,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-RainezZz: night
12-09-2020T23:45:39,KeefMcDerpface,bye Ord
