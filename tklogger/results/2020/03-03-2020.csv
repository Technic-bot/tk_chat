03-03-2020T20:31:21,JojoF2415,I tried drawing my self in preschool. I compared it to a drawing of myself I made recently. Huge improvements
03-03-2020T20:48:48,Dadrobit,"Yeah, Arizona did away with dst forever ago. It's awesome."
03-03-2020T20:50:45,Dadrobit,Our courts argued that the sun sucks so bad and reduces the morale of the people so intensely that to have a government mandate to subject the people to more sun than was necessary was/is unconstitutionally cruel.

03-03-2020T21:31:26,SpazztasticKiwi,pokemon is copyright - we can only make the designs in the book with no legal exceptions
03-03-2020T21:31:42,SpazztasticKiwi,and this woman can‚Äôt get that through her head
03-03-2020T21:32:59,SpazztasticKiwi,she‚Äôs ‚Äúhad the same thing done (last year) and can‚Äôt get why we can‚Äôt because ‚Äúit‚Äôs still the same colors as the book design‚Äù

03-03-2020T21:40:07,CrRAR,"Just make a pretend pokemon, she won't know the difference."
03-03-2020T21:40:55,SpazztasticKiwi,we can‚Äôt do that - pokemon as a whole is copyrighted
03-03-2020T21:41:31,SpazztasticKiwi,"while I know you mean make a fake pokemon, she wants the pokemon logo, which is of course the copyright part"
03-03-2020T21:41:39,CrRAR,ohhhh
03-03-2020T21:41:51,CrRAR,Yeah not happening.

03-03-2020T21:43:07,CrRAR,I can't believe Pokemon-licensed cakes don't exist SOMEWHERE.
03-03-2020T21:43:07,SpazztasticKiwi,"much like any other time she‚Äôs there, you have to stand with her and babysit as she rambles on and this poor guy who‚Äôs walked up had to wait till I could get a break to help him"
03-03-2020T21:43:48,SpazztasticKiwi,she goes on to ask me if I have kids
03-03-2020T21:43:53,SpazztasticKiwi,I very much do not
03-03-2020T21:44:15,CrRAR,"""Maam, while you work on your square-hole-round-peg problem Imma gonna help this guy"""
03-03-2020T21:44:52,SpazztasticKiwi,"and this is because she wants to know what a 12 year old girl would like, which of this is her kid how does she not know her kid and how does she not know what a preteen girl would like"
03-03-2020T21:45:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"guessing that she didn‚Äôt just spawn from the Karen spores that spread every year, she should‚Äôve been one at one point"

03-03-2020T21:46:14,SpazztasticKiwi,"not to mention, in order for me to have a 12 year old daughter to help with that question, I would‚Äôve had to be 12 myself when I had her"
03-03-2020T21:46:56,SpazztasticKiwi,that was about the age I decided I didn‚Äôt like or want children anyhow

03-03-2020T21:49:03,CrRAR,Is Albus Dumbledore one of the famous faces?
03-03-2020T21:49:24,SpazztasticKiwi,he‚Äôs under the harry potter copyright
03-03-2020T21:49:28,SpazztasticKiwi,I liked the jonas brothers when they came out
03-03-2020T21:49:42,Dadrobit,Boy bands... Are Backstreet Boys still a thing with the kids?

03-03-2020T21:51:08,CrRAR,lol
03-03-2020T21:51:25,SpazztasticKiwi,"as for the backstreet boys, I knew of them growing up and listened to them but because they weren‚Äôt active anymore at the time and I‚Äôd never seen them, I‚Äôd thought they were dead or something"
03-03-2020T21:51:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"nah, they‚Äôre just retired"
03-03-2020T21:52:07,Dadrobit,What about.... Aaron Carter? He's big with the young girls right?

03-03-2020T22:05:44,BadFoMo,"Also, @Dadrobit did you get your request in? There's going to be an Omni-Poll on Friday."
03-03-2020T22:18:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"Tom, if I add a note for my suggestion in parentheses, would it be understood to be just for you & not necessarily meant to be included in the polls"
03-03-2020T22:33:31,BadFoMo,It works with my requests.
03-03-2020T22:35:10,SpazztasticKiwi,that‚Äôs what I figured
03-03-2020T22:38:54,SpazztasticKiwi,have we seen anything like trace scratching Flora like a normal cat
03-03-2020T22:42:39,SpazztasticKiwi,"how rude would it be if red bought the felines in the manor a scratching post, meaning well"
03-03-2020T23:22:56,Dadrobit,"I think I did? Thanks for the reminder though, I'll check."
