31-10-2020T18:18:05,ShamusTheFox,It's both adorable and disconcerting.
31-10-2020T18:18:27,falangie123,how does tom know where all the spots go every time he draws Kat?
31-10-2020T18:18:29,CrRAR,When very happy they wiggle slightly
31-10-2020T18:18:40,falangie123,must be hard to remember

31-10-2020T18:19:02,NezumiYuki,"Tom made himself a handy reference sheet of Kathrin, so knowing where to put the spots is simple."
31-10-2020T18:19:08,NezumiYuki,Well relatively simple....
31-10-2020T18:19:16,NezumiYuki,For him anyway
31-10-2020T18:19:23,InTheLionsDen,There are a few key spots. The rest are random.
31-10-2020T18:19:25,NezumiYuki,He's the author and all that.  xD

31-10-2020T18:20:26,ShamusTheFox,That's her Halloween costume. She gets a marker and adds one spot and suddenly no one recognizes her.
31-10-2020T18:20:26,MisterWho,sports = spots
31-10-2020T18:22:19,NezumiYuki,"I suppose you're right, MrWho.   Maeve also brought up that question if Kats was part Snow Leo on their meeting."
31-10-2020T18:22:44,NezumiYuki,LOL Shamus
31-10-2020T18:22:45,MisterWho,It...should be in her bio..i think.

31-10-2020T22:26:43,steelabjur,"To be fair, she would probably be just as unhinged if it was Trace in his normal form dressed like that."
31-10-2020T22:28:16,SpazztasticKiwi,a girl ‚ùóÔ∏èfor her man no matter what he wears if she‚Äôs in the mood

31-10-2020T22:36:43,steelabjur,"Yeah, kinda obvious, right?"
31-10-2020T22:36:48,SpazztasticKiwi,I have worse but I hesitate to share
31-10-2020T22:37:21,SpazztasticKiwi,because we‚Äôre  already barreling down the rabbit hole at lightning speed

31-10-2020T22:41:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom is chocolate deadly to the furry in TK or is it only food
31-10-2020T22:42:04,AspiringNoodle,Chocolate is fine
31-10-2020T22:42:56,KeefMcDerpface,Flora was sketched eating chocolate so I guess it's fine.
31-10-2020T22:44:50,steelabjur,"""Oooh Trace~!"" https://www.deviantart.com/twokinds/art/Trading-Halves-102753649"
31-10-2020T22:44:58,Snowmanwizard,yea chocolate is fine for keidren

31-10-2020T22:45:58,KeefMcDerpface,:ptv-laugh:
31-10-2020T22:48:14,SpazztasticKiwi,the silence is deafening
31-10-2020T22:48:45,steelabjur,I'm kind of sirprised noone commented on that comic I linked...
31-10-2020T22:48:53,steelabjur,*surprised
31-10-2020T22:49:31,SpazztasticKiwi,oh I saw when I browsed da a minute ago
31-10-2020T22:49:39,AspiringNoodle,Is old one.  Still funny tho :ptv-snicker:
31-10-2020T22:49:56,Ordithus,[Help]*:ctwokinds-traceflohug:
31-10-2020T22:51:42,SpazztasticKiwi,"so if Trace has Flora‚Äôs undercarriage, who goes into heat"
31-10-2020T22:52:25,steelabjur,Depends on how much of the... undercarriage he has.
31-10-2020T22:52:42,AspiringNoodle,I'm not familiar with animal biology
31-10-2020T22:52:45,SpazztasticKiwi,it looks like the ovaries are included in that scene
31-10-2020T22:52:58,AspiringNoodle,I'm not sure what bits are responsible for it :snake:
31-10-2020T22:53:12,Ordithus,the bits
31-10-2020T22:53:27,SpazztasticKiwi,"although cats are higher than humans, with a human body I‚Äôd guess Flora‚Äôs is about where ours is"
31-10-2020T22:54:00,AspiringNoodle,"Okay, looks like the bits are responsible"
31-10-2020T22:54:23,AspiringNoodle,"But since it's the ladies that go into heat, and humans don't have that biological quirk, I imagine noone is the answer."
31-10-2020T22:54:48,SpazztasticKiwi,the thalamus is responsible for sending the signals for the ovaries to get to work
31-10-2020T22:55:04,SpazztasticKiwi,or some organ is
31-10-2020T22:55:18,AspiringNoodle,"I double down on my answer, then"
31-10-2020T22:55:36,AspiringNoodle,"Flora is the only one wired for going into heat, but Trace has the bits now :snail:"
31-10-2020T22:55:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I got news for you
31-10-2020T22:55:46,SpazztasticKiwi,technically humans don‚Äôt have a heat but there is a certain time
31-10-2020T22:55:48,SpazztasticKiwi,...
31-10-2020T22:56:03,SpazztasticKiwi,but I‚Äôm not about to play teacher
31-10-2020T22:56:06,steelabjur,"Biologically, being like that in the long term wouldn't be good."
31-10-2020T22:56:14,SpazztasticKiwi,nope
31-10-2020T22:57:02,Ordithus,there's a recent freefall strip that goes into that a bit
31-10-2020T22:57:11,SpazztasticKiwi,I can say from experience it IS NOT GOOD when lady hormones go any sort of out of wack
31-10-2020T22:57:17,SpazztasticKiwi,"or in my case, stop"
31-10-2020T22:57:59,SpazztasticKiwi,"or slack, give or take"
31-10-2020T22:59:59,steelabjur,brb
31-10-2020T23:00:23,SpazztasticKiwi,can‚Äôt imagine Trace trying to learn to walk with those new feet
31-10-2020T23:01:37,SpazztasticKiwi,next year Trace gets Flora a lifelike doll of him
31-10-2020T23:01:46,SpazztasticKiwi,it turns out to be a voodoo doll
31-10-2020T23:02:10,Ordithus,Raine gets to deal with swapping feet often :ctwokinds-RaineEep:
31-10-2020T23:02:35,SpazztasticKiwi,the balance adaption
31-10-2020T23:03:35,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-floraquestion: I wonder if she walks on the balls of her feet in human form because of that
31-10-2020T23:04:27,KeefMcDerpface,Who? Raine?
31-10-2020T23:04:35,Ordithus,yeah
31-10-2020T23:05:04,KeefMcDerpface,I think she more or less did back when she was half-and-half.
31-10-2020T23:05:20,KeefMcDerpface,One leg Keidran and one human.
31-10-2020T23:06:27,Snowmanwizard,ball of foot is better for sneaking than heel like humans do
31-10-2020T23:16:40,steelabjur,"@SpazztasticKiwi I always thought it would be a fun sketch for Meave to find Kat's dolls of the cast and play with them, only for them to turn out to be like voodoo dolls."
31-10-2020T23:17:27,steelabjur,"back, btw."
31-10-2020T23:17:30,KeefMcDerpface,wb
31-10-2020T23:19:07,SpazztasticKiwi,suggest it
31-10-2020T23:19:18,steelabjur,I don't recommend walking around with a hurt foot. :x Not fun.
31-10-2020T23:20:27,SpazztasticKiwi,see how nat reacts to being tugged around as the damsel princess in distress while keith is made into the knight in shining armor
31-10-2020T23:21:17,steelabjur,"@SpazztasticKiwi I has no money, especially now. Maybe after the Plague runs its course things might be different."
31-10-2020T23:21:28,SpazztasticKiwi,fighting the evil king Trace who‚Äôs locked her away and sent his feral tiger to guard the palace
31-10-2020T23:21:48,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúI hate this‚Äù

31-10-2020T23:28:20,Ordithus,a little edit yeah
31-10-2020T23:28:52,steelabjur,Not as obviously at least.
31-10-2020T23:30:05,Snowmanwizard,early on wasn
31-10-2020T23:30:26,SpazztasticKiwi,I know the ones that have been chatting are
31-10-2020T23:30:26,Snowmanwizard,wasnt it show that keidren could become more animal then it it is now?
31-10-2020T23:30:29,SpazztasticKiwi,in general
31-10-2020T23:31:01,SpazztasticKiwi,if there‚Äôs been someone only commenting on occasion or someone new  I could‚Äôve missed em
31-10-2020T23:31:27,Ordithus,I think that was changed to match the book version
31-10-2020T23:31:59,SpazztasticKiwi,"also, that‚Äôs the majority of who I come across here"
31-10-2020T23:41:31,Snowmanwizard,"well. bed calls, work in 5 hours, good night"

31-10-2020T23:46:34,Snowmanwizard,"i seen that spazz, why were you talking to frosty's wife eh?"
31-10-2020T23:48:13,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm asking why you think I was only assuming I was talking to all boys
31-10-2020T23:49:47,SpazztasticKiwi,as in do you think I was lumping you with them when you‚Äôre actually a she
31-10-2020T23:51:13,Snowmanwizard,"no no, somehting rima said earlier, nothing you said"
31-10-2020T23:51:41,Snowmanwizard,chat wont let me look that far back now

31-10-2020T23:52:46,Snowmanwizard,can
31-10-2020T23:53:20,SpazztasticKiwi,there‚Äôs maybe a total of 4 other girls that come here infrequently at best
31-10-2020T23:54:12,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt know them all and there‚Äôs likely more than that because those 4 are just ones I‚Äôve noticed over the years & at least two aren‚Äôt on over half the time
31-10-2020T23:55:04,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve surprised many a newcomer when affirming I am a she
31-10-2020T23:56:03,Snowmanwizard,"haha, i am a guy, just playing the game of ""how dare you awesome my identy"" sorry if that offends anyone"
31-10-2020T23:57:05,SpazztasticKiwi,and to be honest being or staying unidentified is sometimes preferable
31-10-2020T23:57:30,SpazztasticKiwi,that joke is quite well over used yeah
31-10-2020T23:57:50,SpazztasticKiwi,but I also remember you‚Äôve been around before
31-10-2020T23:58:16,SpazztasticKiwi,if you can even consider it a joke because it‚Äôs quite dry
31-10-2020T23:59:18,Ordithus,I confused someone the other week
31-10-2020T23:59:54,SpazztasticKiwi,I have half a mind to retry the unknown identity situation because of some of it
