17-03-2020T11:13:59,TerraTheWizard,i was supposed to have a job interview tomorrow but it's been cancelled because of the covidses
17-03-2020T11:14:25,TerraTheWizard,gotta wait for a rescheduled phone interview next week :ctwokinds-floAAA:
17-03-2020T11:53:27,Kameloh,"maan, good luck with that!"
17-03-2020T12:03:42,DZAladan,"Boy, when you make even the slightest change to a game and, all of a sudden, ALL assets you made so far need to be redone."
17-03-2020T12:03:44,DZAladan,*siiiiiigh* Gimme strength people.
17-03-2020T13:03:36,AspiringNoodle,"What game, what engine, and GOOD VIBES!"
17-03-2020T13:03:47,AspiringNoodle,vibrates intensely in prayer.
17-03-2020T13:04:13,DZAladan,"No engine, it's a TCG. I gotta remake the cards I made so far. Also thank you, I needed it. :3"
17-03-2020T13:07:18,AspiringNoodle,TCG? OwO
17-03-2020T13:07:30,AspiringNoodle,"I... have a bit of a softspot for those, lol"
17-03-2020T13:07:53,AspiringNoodle,"I *would* play Hearthstone, but that game requires so much time to make a decent deck if you start late..."
17-03-2020T13:08:12,AspiringNoodle,"I also don't like how they turn certain card packs into ""wild"" cards after so long so you can't use them in official play"
17-03-2020T13:08:28,DZAladan,"That's what TV Tropes calls, in any game, ""Early Game Hell""."
17-03-2020T13:09:13,AspiringNoodle,There was an interview with a pro Hearthstone player
17-03-2020T13:09:32,AspiringNoodle,"He said that if you started after the first few card packs, it'll take about a year to build a decent deck"
17-03-2020T13:09:45,AspiringNoodle,"Either that, or dump a shit ton of money into the game, lol"
17-03-2020T13:10:19,AspiringNoodle,You ever play yugioh?
17-03-2020T13:10:47,DZAladan,That's pretty much a standard for any free-to-play TCG. lol
17-03-2020T13:10:48,DZAladan,"Yep, I'm a big YGO fan actually. In fact, it's my main inspiration."
17-03-2020T13:11:31,AspiringNoodle,I think I stopped playing around the time that synchro hit the game
17-03-2020T13:11:41,AspiringNoodle,The game was just getting too crazy with what you could do
17-03-2020T13:12:07,DZAladan,"I personally didn't ""directly"" play the game in a long time, but I had a lot of fun making my own rules."
17-03-2020T13:12:21,AspiringNoodle,I recognized what would later become a tier 0 set :P
17-03-2020T13:12:24,AspiringNoodle,deck*
17-03-2020T13:12:24,DZAladan,"To the point I thought ""what if I make my own game instead?"""
17-03-2020T13:12:38,AspiringNoodle,Remember the Gladiator Beasts?
17-03-2020T13:12:45,DZAladan,Yep.
17-03-2020T13:12:55,AspiringNoodle,I was the only one of my friends to go ham on those cards
17-03-2020T13:13:41,AspiringNoodle,"Turned out I was right, later at an official tournament, after they started releasing gladiator beast fusions, one player had a Gladiator Beast deck using all of them and went tier 0"
17-03-2020T13:13:50,DZAladan,"I personally find Cyberdarks fun to use. Not very efficient, admittedly, but I like their gimmick."
17-03-2020T13:14:38,AspiringNoodle,Gladiator Beast was just too damn versatile
17-03-2020T13:15:02,AspiringNoodle,The ability to swap out your given beast with another one from the deck of your choice and activate its special on summon was oppressive
17-03-2020T13:16:44,AspiringNoodle,"Pulling beasts from the graveyard, destroying spells / traps, destroying monsters, direct attack, extra attack / defense, can't be destroyed by battle, etc."
17-03-2020T13:16:56,AspiringNoodle,You could literally craft a counter to any kind of deck.
17-03-2020T13:18:54,AspiringNoodle,*sigh*
17-03-2020T13:19:06,AspiringNoodle,Maybe I should try that MTG tcg
17-03-2020T13:19:31,AspiringNoodle,"What I don't like about Hearthstone in particular is what I mentioned earlier, they basically ban cards a few packs old"
17-03-2020T13:20:39,AspiringNoodle,Or maybe yours ;)
17-03-2020T13:21:29,DZAladan,"Mine won't be ready before a loooong time, since I'm alone in it. lol"
17-03-2020T13:21:43,DZAladan,"Also... believe it or not, but it's supposed to be mostly a story element for a comic."
17-03-2020T13:22:13,DZAladan,"Making it actually playable is mostly a nitpick of mine. If I'll actually release it, it'll be a bonus."
17-03-2020T13:29:49,DZAladan,"My comic can be summarized as ""dragons with unsolved issues from their past play a card game and meet through it as common interest""."
17-03-2020T13:30:36,AspiringNoodle,"ha, naisu"
17-03-2020T14:21:19,Dadrobit,"Full well acknowledging the fact that MTG is the OG ""The most op card is a credit card"" type of tgc, the MTG Arena game is actually really very good about new player integration and free player rewards."
17-03-2020T14:22:04,AspiringNoodle,"That's what I was talking about, the arena version"
17-03-2020T14:22:12,AspiringNoodle,"I still have boxes of old TCG stuff, lol"
17-03-2020T14:23:04,Dadrobit,"It gives you a bunch of decks for free off the bat and you progress towards new packs pretty steadily since the ""missions"" are just like, ""use 15 green mana cards"" and ""win a game"" with plenty of daily and weekly missions to keep you earning consistently."
17-03-2020T14:24:26,Dadrobit,"Personally I just save up the in game currency for drafts. It's just straight up ""Pick out your own deck to participate with and keep everything you pick."""
17-03-2020T14:24:43,Dadrobit,Super good way to get cards quick-ish.
17-03-2020T14:26:03,Dadrobit,"Also, if you do want to spend some money, the IRL Plainswalker decks you can pick up at the store also can be redeemed in-game so you can buy a deck for some game night fun with friends/family IRL, and also get all the cards online as well."
17-03-2020T14:28:29,AspiringNoodle,OwO
17-03-2020T16:32:33,SpazztasticKiwi,we’ve been hit by
17-03-2020T16:32:39,SpazztasticKiwi,we’ve been struck by
17-03-2020T16:32:47,SpazztasticKiwi,a warm weather streak
17-03-2020T16:33:03,DZAladan,Kinda same here.
17-03-2020T16:33:15,DZAladan,But we can't leave our houses.
17-03-2020T16:52:58,AspiringNoodle,^ Opening my window for the breeze
17-03-2020T16:53:08,AspiringNoodle,"Also, I think I've reached my limit with WoW. Again."
17-03-2020T16:53:21,AspiringNoodle,Today was the big achievement for the game
17-03-2020T16:54:24,AspiringNoodle,Rank 15 on the legendary cloak.  15 weeks of minor upgrades to make it one of the most powerful pieces of gear my character has
17-03-2020T16:54:57,AspiringNoodle,"There are further upgrades, but I just found out that it's even more minor than the 15 weeks before that... and top cap out this minor upgrade, you'll need to do it once a week for 25 weeks"
17-03-2020T16:55:21,AspiringNoodle,I'm just like... WHY?!?
17-03-2020T16:55:55,AspiringNoodle,WHY would you make this a once a week deal for 25 weeks?
17-03-2020T16:56:36,AspiringNoodle,I can't even with Blizzard anymore... they're so obsessed with timegating the most minor crap and squeezing out the last smidge of played time from their subs
17-03-2020T17:20:29,TerraTheWizard,"decided to reread the comic,"
17-03-2020T17:20:37,TerraTheWizard,the site is reeeaaallllyyy slow lately
17-03-2020T17:36:48,AspiringNoodle,terra... what do I do? lol
17-03-2020T17:36:57,AspiringNoodle,"I'm unsubbing from WoW, but I still got 1.5 months left"
17-03-2020T17:37:25,DZAladan,"How much is it per month, on average?"
17-03-2020T17:40:07,AspiringNoodle,"$15 for month to month, $13 per 6 (which is what I did)"
17-03-2020T17:40:35,AspiringNoodle,It says something when I go from being a continual sub (with my only hiatus long ago being the final patch of Cata since raiding was too easy)
17-03-2020T17:40:46,AspiringNoodle,To burning out for the last few months of legion
17-03-2020T17:40:55,AspiringNoodle,To burning out for 10 months after 8.1.5 dropped
17-03-2020T17:41:07,AspiringNoodle,To quitting wow AGAIN 4.5 months into this sub...
17-03-2020T17:42:23,DZAladan,"Hmm... so, you'd likely waste ~3 dollars, if you played for 4.5 month. I think you probably got the price more or less worth the enjoyment you got. If the final months aren't worth it anymore, I'd suggest to leave rather than endure further bother."
17-03-2020T17:42:25,AspiringNoodle,"Don't know whether to stop playing WoW entirely, or just relegate it to once in a while / gold farm status.  Try and buy tokens for $15 bnet balance per :/"
17-03-2020T17:42:38,DZAladan,Unless you REALLY don't want these 3 bucks to go to waste.
17-03-2020T17:42:47,AspiringNoodle,"As it stands, I could buy $60 in tokens right now"
17-03-2020T17:44:07,AspiringNoodle,The other question is... will Acti-Blizz even be worth it in the future?
17-03-2020T17:44:45,DZAladan,"I'd say, wait and see. If you're not sure about a new updated/expansions, watch some videos first before you dive into it again."
17-03-2020T17:44:53,DZAladan,*updates
17-03-2020T17:46:19,AspiringNoodle,"I think it's safe to say that if corruption, or any other form of it survives into Shadowlands, WoW is dead to me"
17-03-2020T17:48:00,AspiringNoodle,"Corruption in a nutshell: ""We heard you hated the RNG of titanforging.  So here's a new system with RNG on top of RNG, and WAY more power creep to go along with it!"""
17-03-2020T17:48:12,AspiringNoodle,"""Also if you indulge in it too much it'll kill you."""
17-03-2020T17:48:15,AspiringNoodle,"Wait, what?"
17-03-2020T17:48:20,AspiringNoodle,"""HAVEFUNKBYEEEEEEEEEEE"""
17-03-2020T17:49:48,DZAladan,What's with all these RNGs? Are they planning to become a roguelike?
17-03-2020T17:50:56,AspiringNoodle,"The prevailing theory is that the WoW B team responsible for this expansion, and possibly Legion, were pulled from the Diablo team"
17-03-2020T17:51:20,AspiringNoodle,"As a result, when designing this (maybe last) expansion, they brought with them design philosophies from Diablo"
17-03-2020T17:51:53,AspiringNoodle,"But the problem is that they implemented some of the worst parts of Diablo's design into WoW, without the good sides of a dungeon crawler to negate them"
17-03-2020T17:52:32,AspiringNoodle,"Games like diablo usually have a lot of RNG when it comes to loot, in terms of power, stats, etc.  But they throw it at you all day long."
17-03-2020T17:52:48,AspiringNoodle,MMOs dish them out at a slower pace.  So combine the two and you have a far worse feeling system
17-03-2020T17:53:07,DZAladan,I can imagine.
17-03-2020T17:53:16,DZAladan,It doesn't balance out.
17-03-2020T17:53:33,AspiringNoodle,Corruption if extremely frustrating
17-03-2020T17:54:01,AspiringNoodle,"First, the gear has to corrupt.  Then it needs to be the corruption you want.  And then you might want a specific tier of corruption"
17-03-2020T17:54:17,AspiringNoodle,"Titanforging was just ""did it forge, and how many ilvls?"""
17-03-2020T17:54:28,AspiringNoodle,And that was already polarizing enough.
17-03-2020T17:56:00,AspiringNoodle,I had a piece of gear that would generally be HORRIBLE for my character
17-03-2020T17:56:18,AspiringNoodle,"The stats were wrong, so it would be a downgrade, even though it was an item lvl increase"
17-03-2020T17:56:40,AspiringNoodle,"But thanks to the corruption it rolled, it was a 10% increase to my dps.  10%.  That's ABSURD."
17-03-2020T18:00:09,AspiringNoodle,"I'll stop it there.  I need to work on reeling in my rants.  Suffice to say, there are so many things about WoW that frustrate me at the moment that I could rant for a whole day."

17-03-2020T20:26:11,JojoF2415,I found it a bit funny idk why
17-03-2020T20:26:33,AspiringNoodle,I has advice for people that is probably common sense but I had to learn the hard way~
17-03-2020T20:27:03,AspiringNoodle,If something you do because it's supposed to be fun but instead feels like a chore.  Might be time to stop doing it :upside_down:
17-03-2020T20:27:24,JojoF2415,That’s art class
17-03-2020T20:27:38,JojoF2415,Right now I’m drawing trunks from dragon ball

17-03-2020T20:28:34,JojoF2415,I got to fix the face. It looks a bit off

17-03-2020T20:28:53,AspiringNoodle,But it'd probably take too damn long
17-03-2020T20:29:04,JojoF2415,I’ve been out of school

17-03-2020T21:43:13,HeresyArtStream,helloes! :cheresyartstream-harrywave01:
17-03-2020T21:43:19,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,hi heresy
17-03-2020T21:43:29,Sclimshady,Hi Heresy o/
17-03-2020T21:43:34,Kameloh,evening how goes o/
17-03-2020T21:48:51,HeresyArtStream,I decided to give Folding@Home a try today.
17-03-2020T21:49:14,HeresyArtStream,"I got an RTX 2070 last year and I spend a lot of time away from my computer, so I figured why not."
17-03-2020T21:49:29,BlackjacksSec99,thats one heck of a GPU
17-03-2020T21:49:35,Kameloh,that's cool!
17-03-2020T21:49:43,AspiringNoodle,solid choice~
17-03-2020T21:50:14,AspiringNoodle,"That said, I wish there was more competition against Nvidia's high-end gpus"
17-03-2020T21:50:28,HeresyArtStream,"yeah, it was expensive, even on sale."
17-03-2020T21:50:38,HeresyArtStream,I got it with my tax return last year.
17-03-2020T21:50:40,AspiringNoodle,I got the rtx 2070 super shortly after it came out
17-03-2020T21:50:53,AspiringNoodle,"But even so, I wish AMD at least had something in that range"
17-03-2020T21:51:10,HeresyArtStream,I keep feeling the itch to play Minecraft again but I am also waiting for that RTX update. x3
17-03-2020T21:51:44,BlackjacksSec99,"yeah, ive got AMDs competitor to the 1070 and its kind of lacking even though its touted as equal or better"
17-03-2020T21:52:14,AspiringNoodle,"Generally speaking, AMD's gpus are far more powerful when it comes to general mathematical computation"
17-03-2020T21:52:14,HeresyArtStream,"Yeah, they always seem to do that. I am expecting the same thing from the new game consoles."
17-03-2020T21:52:39,AspiringNoodle,"Nvidia excels at ray tracing calculations, though"
17-03-2020T21:52:59,HeresyArtStream,They said the PS4 was gonna run circles around a high end gaming PC and that wasn't true. x3
17-03-2020T21:52:59,AspiringNoodle,"This is not only evidenced by gameplay, but rendering workloads as well"
17-03-2020T21:53:16,TheBeckoner,Supposedly AMD is doing something big pretty soon on the high end
17-03-2020T21:53:30,AspiringNoodle,"Consoles, generally speaking, DO top the high end when they first come out"
17-03-2020T21:53:35,TheBeckoner,Hopefully a 2080 competitor
17-03-2020T21:53:40,AspiringNoodle,Or at least they did in the past
17-03-2020T21:53:41,BlackjacksSec99,the day shal never come when a console beats a top tier PC
17-03-2020T21:53:58,Zapheth,wasn't the AMD Navi supposed to compete with the RTX series?
17-03-2020T21:54:01,TheBeckoner,yeah I think the new consoles are around a 5700 or something around there
17-03-2020T21:54:02,AspiringNoodle,"But what usually happens is that shortly thereafter the next generation of pc hardware comes out, and starts overtaking the consoles again"
17-03-2020T21:54:15,HeresyArtStream,Even my GTX 680 was still a lot more powerful than a PS4
17-03-2020T21:54:23,BlackjacksSec99,^
17-03-2020T21:54:24,AspiringNoodle,"So they experience superior, if not on par, performance for a short while"
17-03-2020T21:54:32,FoxxTrotter,:cfoxxtrotter-FoxEye:
17-03-2020T21:54:36,AspiringNoodle,But then the market happens and they get lefti n the dust until the next iteration or generation :P
17-03-2020T21:54:55,TheBeckoner,Idk I just know Im not buying next gen consoles
17-03-2020T21:55:12,HeresyArtStream,"I am sure the new consoles will be a major step up from the current ones, but every generation they always say ""It will be faster than the fastest gaming PCs, for the price of a graphics card!"" And that's never true."
17-03-2020T21:55:12,AspiringNoodle,"But now it seems that if they plan to keep up with PCs, while retaining the general launch price expected of consoles, odds are they're going to have to start selling at a loss"
17-03-2020T21:55:13,TheBeckoner,basically a mid tier PC that cant PC
17-03-2020T21:55:28,BlackjacksSec99,"ide buy a PS5 if it truely is 100% backwards compatible, but thats about it"
17-03-2020T21:55:37,AspiringNoodle,^
17-03-2020T21:55:45,TheBeckoner,Ooh forgot about that
17-03-2020T21:55:49,AspiringNoodle,I plan to buy a PS5 because it's so close now that I don't want to buy a PS4 pro
17-03-2020T21:55:55,TheBeckoner,How far back did they say?
17-03-2020T21:56:05,BlackjacksSec99,original PS was the plan
17-03-2020T21:56:08,AspiringNoodle,So I'll just wait for that and then get all the PS4 stuff I want to play :P
17-03-2020T21:56:15,HeresyArtStream,"I am not really interested in the new consoles. Maybe when more games get announced or they get cheaper, but I keep hearing $400-500 which is too much for just a few games I can't get on PC."
17-03-2020T21:56:25,AspiringNoodle,I'll be impressed if they manage to BC the PS3 into the PS5
17-03-2020T21:56:50,AspiringNoodle,"Even when the PS3 was current, the architecture they used for the hardware was ANCIENT"
17-03-2020T21:56:57,BlackjacksSec99,indeed
17-03-2020T21:56:57,HeresyArtStream,The one thing that would get me to buy PS5 would be if it has full backward compatability with the PS4 and plays PS3 games.
17-03-2020T21:57:05,AspiringNoodle,"Made optimizing games a nightmare, and we're just FINALLY starting to get emulators fully functional for the damn thing"
17-03-2020T21:57:14,HeresyArtStream,"Or even better, the whole Playstation library."
17-03-2020T21:57:24,BlackjacksSec99,"heresy, thats what the rumor was"
17-03-2020T21:57:41,BlackjacksSec99,dont know how they plan to do ALL that but hey...
17-03-2020T21:57:49,TheBeckoner,Id be down to play all my old PS2 racing game son a PS5...
17-03-2020T21:57:54,HeresyArtStream,"Right now under my TV I have the PS2, PS3 and PS4. If the PS5 could replace all three I could mothball the others for the foreseeable fuutre."
17-03-2020T21:58:02,BlackjacksSec99,Gran Turismo 2 baby!
17-03-2020T21:58:09,TheBeckoner,Heck yeah
17-03-2020T21:58:40,AspiringNoodle,I hope the PS5 is PS3 capable because there are some PS3 games I want to play
17-03-2020T21:58:45,AspiringNoodle,But I don't want to hunt down a used console
17-03-2020T21:58:58,AspiringNoodle,Namely the 4th and final Sly Cooper game
17-03-2020T21:59:09,HeresyArtStream,"Yeah, Sly 4 is good."
17-03-2020T21:59:18,AspiringNoodle,"I didn't know they made it until last year, and SC3 seemed perfectly capable of being the final entry"
17-03-2020T21:59:31,AspiringNoodle,"Sly fakes amnesia, gives up crime, lives out his life with Carmelita as her constable"
17-03-2020T21:59:36,BlackjacksSec99,"still have my ps2 and 3, never got 4... man, fired up the 3 the other day, the loading screen wait time on Skyrim is laughable"
17-03-2020T21:59:40,HeresyArtStream,"I think gameplay wise, Sly 4 is a lot better than 3."
17-03-2020T21:59:46,HeresyArtStream,3 was way too gimmicky.
17-03-2020T21:59:57,AspiringNoodle,"...I wanna play Sly 1 now, lol"
17-03-2020T22:00:00,AspiringNoodle,That game was so unique
17-03-2020T22:00:09,HeresyArtStream,Every 5 minutes they're throwing a new minigame at you and you rarely get to actually play as Sly.
17-03-2020T22:00:15,AspiringNoodle,"Also yeah, Sly 3 was very gimmicky"
17-03-2020T22:00:21,HeresyArtStream,And the upgrade system was totally broken.
17-03-2020T22:00:25,AspiringNoodle,A bunch of new mission types / mission unique mechanics
17-03-2020T22:00:39,HeresyArtStream,"No more clue bottles on the map either, which made me sad."
17-03-2020T22:00:50,HeresyArtStream,"Hearing that ""tink tink tink"" sound always got me excited. :V"
17-03-2020T22:01:51,HeresyArtStream,"But yeah, they don't give you enough money to buy any upgrades until the pirate ship battles, and at that point the game is almost over anyway so you don't get to use them."
17-03-2020T22:02:10,AspiringNoodle,^ I remember that distinctly
17-03-2020T22:02:29,AspiringNoodle,"Well, hopefully I'll have enough time now to play these older games"
17-03-2020T22:02:47,HeresyArtStream,"Yeah, now's a great time to catch up on ye olde backlog."
17-03-2020T22:02:52,AspiringNoodle,"It saddens me, but hopefully WoW stays bad enough that I hold no interest in returning.  Or it just dies.  You know how the current AAA industry is..."
17-03-2020T22:02:59,HeresyArtStream,x3
17-03-2020T22:03:12,AspiringNoodle,Personally I think we're on the verge of another 1982 style crash
17-03-2020T22:03:15,HeresyArtStream,I was playing WoW Classic and then Blizzard started acting real stupid so I decided to cancel.
17-03-2020T22:03:25,AspiringNoodle,A lot of the big publishers have gotten so greedy they've run their developers into the ground
17-03-2020T22:03:39,HeresyArtStream,"I am occasionally tempted to pick up FFXIV again but right now I am playing FFXV, and soon FFVIII is gonna be out."
17-03-2020T22:03:55,AspiringNoodle,I played classic for a bit before a certain patch went live
17-03-2020T22:03:59,AspiringNoodle,I actually REALLY enjoyed it
17-03-2020T22:04:07,AspiringNoodle,I was able to play it like a game and chat with random people
17-03-2020T22:04:14,HeresyArtStream,It's so weird seeing the mess that is WoW 3 Reforged being such a dumpster fire that EA is able to upstage them with C&C Remastered. x.x
17-03-2020T22:04:23,AspiringNoodle,"There was no ""do these 10 things daily or risk falling behind"""
17-03-2020T22:04:30,AspiringNoodle,The game was solid enough just to play as levelling content
17-03-2020T22:04:46,HeresyArtStream,"Not only that, but C&C Remastered looks great. For once EA stepped back and trusted their devs to make a good game, it looks like."
17-03-2020T22:05:04,AspiringNoodle,"Tbh, our whole financial system needs an overhaul"
17-03-2020T22:05:22,AspiringNoodle,"We hate on the companies, but the people at the top are literally just trying to do their jobs"
17-03-2020T22:05:42,AspiringNoodle,"""long term financial stability"" does not interest investors"
17-03-2020T22:05:46,HeresyArtStream,I think regulating lootboxes would be better for everyone.
17-03-2020T22:05:56,AspiringNoodle,"""sustained indefinite financial growth"" is what they like seeing"
17-03-2020T22:06:11,AspiringNoodle,But that's kinda hard to do once you saturate a market
17-03-2020T22:06:11,HeresyArtStream,Publishers are pushing in-game gambling because it's profitable and there's no disincentive against it.
17-03-2020T22:06:19,AspiringNoodle,"Oh, there will be, lmao"
17-03-2020T22:06:32,HeresyArtStream,It's only a matter of time.
17-03-2020T22:06:41,AspiringNoodle,"Multiple nations are cracking down, labelling that stuff as gambling, or updating / writing new laws to define it as such"
17-03-2020T22:06:56,AspiringNoodle,"At which point they need to either strip it out of their games, region lock features, or pull out entirely"
17-03-2020T22:07:00,HeresyArtStream,Fifa and other sports game pander hard towards normies and now they are noticing that their kids keep asking for money to buy more player packs.
17-03-2020T22:07:13,AspiringNoodle,Or bank accounts are suddenly emptied...
17-03-2020T22:07:28,BlackjacksSec99,*looks hard at wargaming*
17-03-2020T22:07:35,AspiringNoodle,What did they do?!?
17-03-2020T22:07:51,AspiringNoodle,When I played World of Tanks they arguably had the best F2P monetization I'd ever seen :ptv-whiny:
17-03-2020T22:08:05,BlackjacksSec99,lol they are the worst when it comes to loot boxes and ways to make you spend huges sums
17-03-2020T22:08:13,TheBeckoner,Wargaming seemed pretty open anbout what you bought when i played...
17-03-2020T22:08:20,AspiringNoodle,Wargaming has loot boxes?!?
17-03-2020T22:08:20,TheBeckoner,about*
17-03-2020T22:08:24,BlackjacksSec99,containers
17-03-2020T22:08:26,AspiringNoodle,When the fuck did this happen?!?
17-03-2020T22:08:30,BlackjacksSec99,warships
17-03-2020T22:08:39,AspiringNoodle,"Oh, nvm then, lol"
17-03-2020T22:08:43,AspiringNoodle,I played World of Tanks
17-03-2020T22:08:55,AspiringNoodle,"Seriously, I could sing praises about world of tank's monetization for DAYS"
17-03-2020T22:09:02,BlackjacksSec99,"lol tanks may be different but yeah, warships has containers"
17-03-2020T22:09:13,BlackjacksSec99,and ships can get.... expensive...
17-03-2020T22:09:14,AspiringNoodle,Here's how good WoT is
17-03-2020T22:09:22,AspiringNoodle,"You have two separate currencies. Gold, and credits"
17-03-2020T22:09:45,AspiringNoodle,"Credits are earned via gameplay. Gold is the premium bought currency.  However, you can get it through certain in-game events, tournaments, clan wars, etc."
17-03-2020T22:10:15,AspiringNoodle,"Gold is capable of purchasing premium ammo, but a long time ago they added a conversion rate of 400 credits per 1 gold, so now you can buy this ammo with credits"
17-03-2020T22:10:19,AspiringNoodle,You just pay out the ass
17-03-2020T22:10:55,BlackjacksSec99,"warships has the same system, only its credits and doubloons."
17-03-2020T22:11:13,AspiringNoodle,"Okay, then it's the same with what you can buy then?"
17-03-2020T22:11:46,AspiringNoodle,"Premium account (50% boost to xp / credits), camo, removal of certain equipment from vehicles, training of crew, etc."
17-03-2020T22:12:08,BlackjacksSec99,"yeah, you can buy ships, camo, credits and XP with doubloons. you dont pay for ammo in warships."
17-03-2020T22:12:25,AspiringNoodle,"In World of Tanks, you buy ammo for your guns :P"
17-03-2020T22:12:36,AspiringNoodle,Part of it is that they usually have multiple types of ammo you can buy
17-03-2020T22:12:54,AspiringNoodle,My favorite part of World of Tanks was the premium tanks...
17-03-2020T22:13:03,BlackjacksSec99,"in warships you have an automatic service fee at the end of the match that depends on your tier, ship type, and camo and flag modifiers"
17-03-2020T22:13:38,AspiringNoodle,Tanks also has that.  I think you can choose whether or not you want ammo replaced
17-03-2020T22:13:47,BlackjacksSec99,"premium ships... oh boy... ok, they are cool in their own rights, but holy cow you  pay for them"
17-03-2020T22:14:09,AspiringNoodle,"Half a year into playing World of Tanks, I bought my first premium tank, the Löwe"
17-03-2020T22:14:36,AspiringNoodle,"There was a russian tree event that made it easier to progress, and I still hadn't learned all the mechanics"
17-03-2020T22:14:50,AspiringNoodle,But I still don't regret the $53 purchase
17-03-2020T22:15:37,BlackjacksSec99,"oh, ive got more than a few premiums... im not terrbily ashamed to say ive put money into it. but still some ships are just too much to justify their price."
17-03-2020T22:16:23,AspiringNoodle,"I'm sure it's the same in warships, but they have a credit modifier so you earn more, and they're between a fresh tank and a fully upgraded one in terms of power"
17-03-2020T22:16:32,BlackjacksSec99,"about half of my prems are from containers Ive won though, so, eh, loot boxes..."
17-03-2020T22:16:48,AspiringNoodle,I won one of my favorite tanks
17-03-2020T22:17:46,BlackjacksSec99,"ive got 22 premiums. 6 of which came from a player gathering, 8 from loot boxes"
17-03-2020T22:18:14,BlackjacksSec99,...holy crap ive got 22 premiums....
17-03-2020T22:18:20,AspiringNoodle,I probably got way more~ lol
17-03-2020T22:18:33,AspiringNoodle,I actually have one of the most coveted premium tanks in the game
17-03-2020T22:18:38,AspiringNoodle,The Type 59
17-03-2020T22:18:55,AspiringNoodle,"It was a complete shitshow when this thing came out.  I think it was selling for $35, and it completely broke the balance of the game"
17-03-2020T22:18:57,BlackjacksSec99,"ive got 55 ships in my port right now, but had to sell a bunch of the lower tier ones that I dont use anymore"
17-03-2020T22:19:13,BlackjacksSec99,lol sounds like a couple they had in ships too
17-03-2020T22:19:24,BlackjacksSec99,missouri was/is broken
17-03-2020T22:19:38,AspiringNoodle,"The Type 59 was the first Chinese tank in the game, based on the T-54 from the Russian tree"
17-03-2020T22:19:56,BlackjacksSec99,you earn insane credits with it. like unreasonably so. usually 1 million a match
17-03-2020T22:19:57,AspiringNoodle,"Fun fact, this is because the Type 59 is a modified T-54 back from when Communist Russia and China were all buddy buddy"
17-03-2020T22:20:23,BlackjacksSec99,"ahhhh, I do love wargaming for all the historical accuracy"
17-03-2020T22:20:35,AspiringNoodle,"But the T-54 is a tier 9 medium tank, notorious for low profile, good gun / accuracy, and reasonable acceleration, top speed, and handling"
17-03-2020T22:20:46,AspiringNoodle,On top of REALLY good armor
17-03-2020T22:21:12,AspiringNoodle,"It's not particularly thick, but the front of the tank is very sloped, and the elliptical-circle turret is hard to penetrate"
17-03-2020T22:21:31,BlackjacksSec99,sounds like the tanks version of the uss georgia
17-03-2020T22:21:31,AspiringNoodle,"Even with premium tank toning, the gun and armor were too good combined with its mobility"
17-03-2020T22:21:49,AspiringNoodle,This thing was a fucking heavy tank with a turbo engine xD
17-03-2020T22:21:57,BlackjacksSec99,lol
17-03-2020T22:22:03,AspiringNoodle,They pulled it from the shop after a week and started nerfing it
17-03-2020T22:22:18,AspiringNoodle,"Some people complained, but that thing dominated tier 8 matches"
17-03-2020T22:22:38,AspiringNoodle,"Long story short, I won mine during a competition well after they stopped selling it completely"
17-03-2020T22:22:44,BlackjacksSec99,"georgia is a battleship thats as fast as the speedy destroyers and comes with an engine boost making it stupid fast, and has the second largest guns in the game combined with pretty good armor"
17-03-2020T22:23:00,AspiringNoodle,"And all it took was killing 12 tanks and doing almost 5x my health in damage, lmao"
17-03-2020T22:23:14,BlackjacksSec99,"lol yeah, i remember you telling that one"
17-03-2020T22:23:20,AspiringNoodle,RIP the other team
17-03-2020T22:23:33,BlackjacksSec99,other team had to be PISSED
17-03-2020T22:23:45,AspiringNoodle,"Or like, ""WHAT THE FUCK?!? THIS GUY IS DESTROYING US!!!"""
17-03-2020T22:24:00,BlackjacksSec99,why is it ONE GUY?!?!?!?!?!
17-03-2020T22:25:10,AspiringNoodle,"Me: *has memorized internal component / crew layout, armor thickness / angle, spaced armor locations, map geography, and tank handling characteristics*"
17-03-2020T22:25:27,AspiringNoodle,"""Stay the fuck out of my way or get rolled"""
17-03-2020T22:25:37,BlackjacksSec99,get gud brah
17-03-2020T22:25:42,BlackjacksSec99,lol
17-03-2020T22:26:01,AspiringNoodle,I had a match where I almost topped that
17-03-2020T22:26:37,SpazztasticKiwi,watching someone trying to get their sims to start a business
17-03-2020T22:26:41,SpazztasticKiwi,the chef died
17-03-2020T22:26:50,AspiringNoodle,"Back when I was levelling the french medium tree, and was using the lorraine 40t"
17-03-2020T22:27:05,AspiringNoodle,"The gun on that thing was good, as well as the mobility / handling, but the profile was fucking horrid"
17-03-2020T22:27:12,AspiringNoodle,giant rectangle with zero armor
17-03-2020T22:27:33,AspiringNoodle,"Still, managed to get an 11 kill game that we still lost"
17-03-2020T22:27:43,AspiringNoodle,All because one person was afk / d/c at the spawn
17-03-2020T22:28:10,AspiringNoodle,"And this was before they implemented the badge system where if you had an outstanding performance, you got the same xp / credits as a win"
17-03-2020T22:28:33,AspiringNoodle,"I was REALLY happy when they implemented that.  As long as you kick enough ass and still lose, you are still treated as if you won"
17-03-2020T22:28:34,BlackjacksSec99,gahhhhh man i hate that....
17-03-2020T22:28:49,BlackjacksSec99,"like, a poor player is one thing, but AFK..."
17-03-2020T22:29:05,AspiringNoodle,"Btw, I had a game where I tried to repeat the success from my type 59 winning game xD"
17-03-2020T22:29:11,AspiringNoodle,Little tier 5 german tank with the derp gun
17-03-2020T22:29:27,AspiringNoodle,"I still died / we still lost, but omg, I probably scared them shitless!"
17-03-2020T22:29:54,BlackjacksSec99,"i do wish warships would do that, we still lose hard if we lose...."
17-03-2020T22:30:15,AspiringNoodle,"Part of it is that at lower tiers, with certain guns / knowledge, you can still win"
17-03-2020T22:30:22,AspiringNoodle,Lots of tanks have weaknesses you can exploit
17-03-2020T22:30:37,BlackjacksSec99,"at the same time, in warships, even tier 1 ships have the potential to damage tier 10 ships..."
17-03-2020T22:31:25,AspiringNoodle,"fun fact, did you know that the Maus is a literal german super heavy tank?"
17-03-2020T22:31:30,BlackjacksSec99,?
17-03-2020T22:31:51,BlackjacksSec99,"plz hold, gonna load my tanks account...."
17-03-2020T22:32:50,AspiringNoodle,188 effing metric ton heavy tank packing an astounding 128mm main armament
17-03-2020T22:33:22,AspiringNoodle,The thinnest point of the armor is at the rear at an amazing 150mm thick
17-03-2020T22:33:33,AspiringNoodle,The front is up to 220mm thick
17-03-2020T22:33:55,BlackjacksSec99,........ damn
17-03-2020T22:34:25,BlackjacksSec99,128mm is as big as some of the cruisers and destroyers in warships. thats impressive
17-03-2020T22:36:26,BlackjacksSec99,27k battles?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
17-03-2020T22:38:15,AspiringNoodle,Thought you'd be more impressed by some of my other stats :P
17-03-2020T22:38:37,AspiringNoodle,Like a near 63% win rate in the type 59 at almost 900 battles
17-03-2020T22:39:33,AspiringNoodle,"Fun fact, average win rate for the game is near 48 - 49%, in part because the matchmaker algorithm attempts to assemble teams in such a way as to equalize win rates"
17-03-2020T22:40:05,AspiringNoodle,"but when you're that good... you give the MM the finger and say ""I'm carrying this shit. Just TRY to stop me."""
17-03-2020T22:40:06,BlackjacksSec99,"yeah, warships tries to equalize things too. your whole profile is impressive, honestly"
17-03-2020T22:40:37,AspiringNoodle,I think my WN8 as an average is about 2800
17-03-2020T22:40:48,AspiringNoodle,"But when I stopped playing, I was average 3300 - 3600 weekly"
17-03-2020T22:41:19,BlackjacksSec99,"im sitting at 400 random battles in warships, over 700 co-op battles. co op battles are 97% win rate ( very easy) but my PvP win rate is rather low at 43% im not a great player lol"
17-03-2020T22:42:09,AspiringNoodle,"Wow, I blew through the AMX 50 Foch, lmao"
17-03-2020T22:42:25,AspiringNoodle,"Tier 9 TD, only 62 battles but near 71% winrate"
17-03-2020T22:42:29,BlackjacksSec99,"im doing good damage, but I seem to always be on the losing team :-?"
17-03-2020T22:44:38,AspiringNoodle,I remember having so many bad loss streaks in WoT xD
17-03-2020T22:44:41,AspiringNoodle,The rage was real
17-03-2020T22:44:48,LittleNapoleon,(those little turquoise details really make this pic come alive kam!)
17-03-2020T22:44:49,AspiringNoodle,"It was when I was good, too"
17-03-2020T22:44:59,AspiringNoodle,"Suffice to say, I shut up and carried harder! lmao"
17-03-2020T22:45:16,BlackjacksSec99,lol indeed which is why even the BEST guys are at like 60-61% win rates
17-03-2020T22:45:17,Sclimshady,Kame is the blingmaster
17-03-2020T22:45:49,Kameloh,thanks!

17-03-2020T22:46:28,BlackjacksSec99,indeed! that a lot of little details going into it
17-03-2020T22:47:35,LittleNapoleon,did you construct that background with a lot of it in mind? or did it grow organically from putting paint on the canvas?
17-03-2020T22:48:00,RimaDraws,well bedtime for me! night guys!

17-03-2020T23:58:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve yet to register but my flight and hotel have been set for awhile
17-03-2020T23:58:46,PurpleLemons,"I was looking forward to making products, but this whole thing has haulted my progress"
17-03-2020T23:59:01,Kameloh,"yeah I already paid for flight, hotel, and tickets :weary:"
17-03-2020T23:59:18,Kameloh,so it's been a big bummer
