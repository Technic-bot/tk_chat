10-11-2020T23:31:57,SpazztasticKiwi,is there a such thing as zoos in TK at all
10-11-2020T23:32:59,SpazztasticKiwi,or is that akin to....racist at all
10-11-2020T23:40:20,SpazztasticKiwi,do you guys think that “heeeeres johnny” joke has been overdone yet
10-11-2020T23:40:35,SpazztasticKiwi,because I thought of one the other day among other things
10-11-2020T23:46:17,Ordithus,you mean for a sketch idea?
10-11-2020T23:52:47,SpazztasticKiwi,yea
10-11-2020T23:53:33,CrimsonHelsing,What I want to know is if red is right about what he said in the last page. At least now there's a way out at least
10-11-2020T23:53:36,SpazztasticKiwi,the zoo idea isn’t likely to be popular so I’ll share it & use another as my suggestion
10-11-2020T23:54:10,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s if Trace took Flora to the zoo and she’s like “Look Trace! Tigers!”
10-11-2020T23:54:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Trace just “???”
10-11-2020T23:56:56,Ordithus,"the only heeeres johnny I can remember wasn't really here's johnny. the line is more taken. the pallete, though"
