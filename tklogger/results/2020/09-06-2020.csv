09-06-2020T00:09:09,SpazztasticKiwi,a boy died wreaking mailboxes once
09-06-2020T00:09:20,SpazztasticKiwi,because of over reinforcement
09-06-2020T00:10:21,SpazztasticKiwi,"took one out, so the retired steel worker made a concrete & steel welded box that looked like a regular tin one but could take a truck and stay standing"
09-06-2020T00:10:37,AspiringNoodle,"Well, that answered my question"
09-06-2020T00:10:52,SpazztasticKiwi,"boy came back to bat this one down two and the bat split, wood went into the kids heart"
09-06-2020T00:10:59,SpazztasticKiwi,too

09-06-2020T00:50:35,johnnytho,wait
09-06-2020T00:51:28,johnnytho,We didn't see this one on Friday
09-06-2020T01:04:17,Dadrobit,Grandaddy did that back in New York a couple decades back. Kid proke his arms when he tried smacking the mailbox in a drive-by.
09-06-2020T01:04:25,Dadrobit,Broke*
09-06-2020T01:04:35,SpazztasticKiwi,proke
09-06-2020T01:04:55,SpazztasticKiwi,when did red get buff
09-06-2020T01:04:56,Dadrobit,The mailbox wars have been going on for decades.
09-06-2020T01:06:06,Dadrobit,"Also, yeah. I didn't get more than a glance at the comic stream, but I recall Karen looking down from above. There was a question of whether or not Mike/Evals had even talked with the sisters yet."
09-06-2020T01:06:59,Twokinds,"Red was always meant to be the jock type. Just early on, I had difficulty drawing male characters."
09-06-2020T01:07:34,Twokinds,So it didn't come across visually as well heheh
09-06-2020T01:07:47,Dadrobit,Early on he was Hot Topic boi lol
09-06-2020T01:08:24,Twokinds,true
09-06-2020T01:09:15,SpazztasticKiwi,took red 15 years to get swole
09-06-2020T01:10:25,Dadrobit,"Dunno if leather and spikes is ""jock"" apparel. Could be considered ""dominant"" in certain... Environments though :D"
09-06-2020T01:10:55,BadFoMo,Yo.
09-06-2020T01:11:10,Dadrobit,o/ FoMo
09-06-2020T01:13:09,BadFoMo,"I don't mean to pester about it, but I did the transcripts for this page and the last. They're in the page's threads"
09-06-2020T01:14:33,SpazztasticKiwi,foggyness any better Tom
09-06-2020T01:21:41,Twokinds,Hard to tell. I'll see how I feel after a couple of days.
09-06-2020T01:21:47,Twokinds,I honestly feel ok right now.
09-06-2020T01:22:04,Twokinds,I'll get that transcript put up
09-06-2020T01:22:21,Twokinds,I just forgot to update it. I had several people message me about it
09-06-2020T01:28:07,AspiringNoodle,Words?  I like looking at the pretty pictures :ptv-hearts:
09-06-2020T01:28:19,AspiringNoodle,Then the words... then putting them together... but mostly the pictures!
09-06-2020T01:28:56,BlackjackSec99,Thanks for the comic Tom! Looks great! Also looks like Red got himself a haircut lol
09-06-2020T01:30:48,johnnytho,Red reminds me a lot of Knuckles
09-06-2020T01:31:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Red got abs
09-06-2020T01:33:21,SpazztasticKiwi,"at night, allergies go to sleep"
09-06-2020T01:33:45,johnnytho,do they?
09-06-2020T01:36:13,AspiringNoodle,My facial hair is becoming more defined
09-06-2020T01:36:25,AspiringNoodle,COVID is a heck of a hair growing solution
09-06-2020T01:36:37,SpazztasticKiwi,they have to - how else do they sock you in the face so hard when you‚Äôre trying to be productive
09-06-2020T01:36:57,SpazztasticKiwi,gotta rest up so they can disturb your work
09-06-2020T01:37:06,AspiringNoodle,I thought allergies were an off again on again relationship
09-06-2020T01:37:21,AspiringNoodle,They don't want to bother you when nothing's getting done
09-06-2020T01:37:33,AspiringNoodle,"But the moment it's most inconvenient they want to hang out, and they don't take no for an answer :D"
09-06-2020T01:38:30,SpazztasticKiwi,sound close enough Tom?
09-06-2020T01:40:27,iliar,"@BadFoMo This time you're faster than me. I just finished making the transcript, and you already."
09-06-2020T01:43:06,SpazztasticKiwi,üõå‚úåüèª
09-06-2020T01:43:34,Dadrobit,"Allergies are an all the time problem for me at least. Zyrtec kinda works. Claritin works a bit better imo, but it also has worse side effects."
09-06-2020T01:44:21,Dadrobit,"Nothing super bad, but the drowsiness really affects me, so I can't drive if I take it."
09-06-2020T01:49:51,AspiringNoodle,I'm lucky enough to not have any allergies
09-06-2020T01:50:15,AspiringNoodle,"That said, give it time, might develop one out of the blue some day"
09-06-2020T01:51:01,Twokinds,"I haven't noticed drowsiness yet, but I'm only on day two"
09-06-2020T01:51:53,AspiringNoodle,Some side effects can take a while to develop?
09-06-2020T01:52:10,AspiringNoodle,Or is this the allergy itself kind of thing?
09-06-2020T01:52:40,Twokinds,"Well, I don't know."
09-06-2020T01:52:57,Twokinds,I don't usually take allergy meds regularly. I'm just saying I haven't noticed it yet.
09-06-2020T01:53:21,AspiringNoodle,Let us know if you ever become sleepy boi
09-06-2020T01:53:50,AspiringNoodle,We won't be mad if you need some extra zzz's :)
09-06-2020T01:53:54,Dadrobit,They usually take effect within a few hours.
09-06-2020T01:54:16,Twokinds,"Well, then they seem fine."
09-06-2020T01:54:33,Dadrobit,I have gnarly bad allergies. Allergic to just about every grass and weed in the state. So I am well accustomed to meds lol.
09-06-2020T01:55:04,AspiringNoodle,"Literally the entire environment: ""Eff that guy, he sucks!"""
09-06-2020T01:55:09,AspiringNoodle,"Dadro: ""Challenge accepted."""
09-06-2020T01:55:11,AspiringNoodle,XD
09-06-2020T01:55:21,BadFoMo,"A little late, but; @Iller Sorry about that. @Twokinds Thanks! ...Also I did one for the last page; its in that page's thread too."
09-06-2020T01:55:46,Dadrobit,Pretty much. Used to get injections every week for years as a kid to help build my immune system against them.
09-06-2020T01:56:23,Dadrobit,"Still have allergies, but at least I can function now."
09-06-2020T01:56:38,AspiringNoodle,That's good!
09-06-2020T01:58:32,Dadrobit,"In my experience, Claritin is a trade off. It removes the bad allergies symptoms and the related.... I dunno, fogginess? But trades it for lethargic fogginess."
09-06-2020T01:59:03,Dadrobit,Different folks react differently though.
09-06-2020T02:02:24,Dadrobit,"BRB, gonna get some tacos."
09-06-2020T02:04:58,AspiringNoodle,*pokes belly*
09-06-2020T02:05:02,AspiringNoodle,I think I'm losing weight
09-06-2020T02:05:08,AspiringNoodle,Not sure if pandemic related
09-06-2020T02:05:58,Dadrobit,"Back, mediocre tacos aquiered. Taco Tuesday is a go."
09-06-2020T02:08:10,AspiringNoodle,No more take-out for me for a while
09-06-2020T02:08:18,AspiringNoodle,"Should help me lose more weight, also want to save money <3"
09-06-2020T02:08:42,AspiringNoodle,"Were these frozen, delivery, or left-over tacos, btw?"
09-06-2020T02:08:44,Dadrobit,Two tacos for a buck. Not breaking the bank here.
09-06-2020T02:09:03,Dadrobit,Filiberto's. Real Mexican fast food.
09-06-2020T02:09:12,AspiringNoodle,Nice
09-06-2020T02:10:08,iliar,"@BadFoMo I woke up less than an hour ago. Therefore, you had an advantage."
09-06-2020T02:10:38,Dadrobit,"(Honestly, the regular tacos from Taco Bell are better, but this was cheaper and on the way to work...)"
09-06-2020T02:13:57,Twokinds,I also vaccuumed and changed the filters of my air purifier.
09-06-2020T02:14:01,Twokinds,Hoping that helps too.
09-06-2020T02:14:20,Dadrobit,Don't tell anyone I said that tho. Else my body's gonna be found with la chancla stuck in my back...
09-06-2020T02:14:28,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-shock:
09-06-2020T02:14:41,AspiringNoodle,"I am a sleepy n00dle, so I'ma head to bed"
09-06-2020T02:14:54,AspiringNoodle,But now I must worry if Dadro gonna get got :c
09-06-2020T02:15:12,Dadrobit,"If you have an AC unit, make sure to install clean filters there as well!"
09-06-2020T02:18:27,Twokinds,Yeah I usually remember to change it
09-06-2020T02:19:23,Dadrobit,Tis the season for climate control maintenance.
09-06-2020T02:21:37,Dadrobit,"It's been pretty mild the last week, and only 104 tomorrow, it's been nice for the protests that it's not killer hot out."

09-06-2020T02:22:57,Dadrobit,"Was upwards of 112 already this year, so it's been a nice break."
09-06-2020T02:23:58,iliar,And I was very asked to ask you a question: Why is Reni fighting using physical strength? Why she doesn't use magic?
09-06-2020T02:25:12,iliar,"As a dragon, she must be very good at magic."
09-06-2020T02:26:21,Dadrobit,"If I recall correctly, it was asked as well during the city fight, and it came down to her being very much still a juvenile who isn't yet confident in welding magic effectively."
09-06-2020T02:26:39,Dadrobit,Could be misremembering tho.
09-06-2020T02:39:10,Twokinds,"Dragons are creatures of magic, for sure. It comes to them naturally, but they do still have to learn how to use it. Reni's only 20 and hasn't trained any combat magic."
09-06-2020T02:47:15,Twokinds,"She has her natural abilities as a dragon (telepathy, shapeshifting, fire breathing) but no advanced magic."
09-06-2020T04:39:20,TheBeginnerArtisst,interseting...
09-06-2020T04:39:48,TheBeginnerArtisst,hello everyone!

09-06-2020T14:18:08,AspiringNoodle,"I'll be honest, the coding for the 2nd amnesia game has some weird stuff in it, lol"
09-06-2020T14:18:27,AspiringNoodle,Like the UI and such is affected by icon size from your desktop settings
09-06-2020T14:18:41,AspiringNoodle,I had to go from 125% -> 100% to center everything
09-06-2020T14:43:05,CrRAR,weird
09-06-2020T14:43:44,CrRAR,Maybe they were on a different engine or something and weren‚Äôt sure of all its oddities.
09-06-2020T14:47:01,AspiringNoodle,What makes it really weird is that it's in real time xD
09-06-2020T14:47:24,AspiringNoodle,"If I start up the game and forget to downsize everything, I can home out and change the setting, and then everything is fine once I hop back in"
09-06-2020T14:54:00,AspiringNoodle,"I must give the game credit, they do a good job of freaking you out, lol"
09-06-2020T14:54:22,AspiringNoodle,"Constant creaking, the pitter patter of footstops, giant freaking earthquakes that shake the entirety of the building to make you walk slow"
09-06-2020T14:55:14,AspiringNoodle,"I get to the main lobby of the mansion and they give the tutorial on how to run and it freaked me out.  But it was a fakeout because it took a bit of exploring, and I finally released a monster by accident"
09-06-2020T15:06:58,CrRAR,"Yeah, it‚Äôs incredible the difference when you can tell they really put time into crafting the atmosphere."
09-06-2020T15:08:01,CrRAR,"Lighting too, the Portal team (and now Alyx) is really good with lighting for not being true horror."
09-06-2020T15:08:35,CrRAR,The Dead Space guys too were top notch at atmosphere and lighting too.
09-06-2020T15:09:11,AspiringNoodle,I still need to play 3
09-06-2020T15:09:26,AspiringNoodle,"But 2 still has the best ""oh shit"" moments I've ever seen"
09-06-2020T15:10:02,AspiringNoodle,"In particular, the school gymnasium and the return to the U.S.S. Ishimura"
09-06-2020T15:10:15,AspiringNoodle,I loved how it looked all sterile and definitely under construction
09-06-2020T15:10:38,AspiringNoodle,"But due to the first game, and everything that's going on, you're freaking the flip out the moment you set foot inside"
09-06-2020T15:10:46,CrRAR,"Yeah, eh, it def is fun for another taste of the universe but 2 did so much so well"
09-06-2020T15:10:48,CrRAR,Yeah
09-06-2020T15:10:51,AspiringNoodle,And it isn't until like 5 - 10 minutes later that you FINALLY start encountering necromorphs
09-06-2020T15:11:16,AspiringNoodle,Especially when you get to the one corridor and it's non-stop necromorphs from both directions for 5 minutes
09-06-2020T15:11:21,AspiringNoodle,I was freaking out the entire time!
09-06-2020T15:12:12,CrRAR,"Haha, multi-layer atmosphere building lol"
09-06-2020T15:12:14,AspiringNoodle,I stopped at the perfect place in A Machine for Pigs
09-06-2020T15:12:35,AspiringNoodle,"Go into a secret corridor, see a two-way painting, creature lying in a caged bed in a room that was locked"
09-06-2020T15:12:59,AspiringNoodle,"You need to restart the ""great machine"", which was probably shaking the entire flippin' mansion"
09-06-2020T15:13:12,AspiringNoodle,"I did that, I go back down the corridor, bed's empty, door's open"
09-06-2020T15:13:32,AspiringNoodle,"And now I'm saved at the perfect, ""Well... f*ck"" moment"
09-06-2020T15:13:49,AspiringNoodle,Now I gotta wonder if the thing's lurking in the house and I'll have to play hide and seek
09-06-2020T15:14:00,AspiringNoodle,Or if it just straight up bolted for an exit
09-06-2020T15:19:08,CrRAR,Probably have to ransack a bunch of tough to reach rooms for random objects
09-06-2020T15:19:42,CrRAR,Is the object of that game to escape or is it just wander around scared aimlessly?
09-06-2020T15:23:19,AspiringNoodle,The Amnesia / Soma games tend to be explore the environment and solve puzzles while trying to survive and get an idea of what the flip is going on
09-06-2020T15:23:56,AspiringNoodle,"I'm playing A Machine for Pigs first because even though it's a later title, it's a bit slimmed down compared to the origial Dark Descent game"
09-06-2020T15:24:04,AspiringNoodle,"Not as much management, less to interact with, etc"
09-06-2020T15:24:15,AspiringNoodle,It's a good way to get a feel for the game before ramping up the difficulty
09-06-2020T15:48:57,CrRAR,"Ah, okay, yeah I remember when AMfP came out I think it came out a long time later or something and the internet was thrilled there was a sequel"
09-06-2020T15:50:53,CrRAR,Eh I guess it was only 3 years

09-06-2020T19:49:35,CrRAR,"oh ord, I always meant to ask someone in that region... have you ever been to Isle Royale Natl Park?"
09-06-2020T19:49:45,CrRAR,looks pretty sick
09-06-2020T19:50:34,CrRAR,I've seen it on maps and always thought it would be cool to go there
09-06-2020T19:51:45,CrRAR,if you look at it on google maps you can totally see how like a glacier dragged across it back in the ice age days.
09-06-2020T19:52:28,CrRAR,seem'd pretty metal :metal:
09-06-2020T19:54:05,Ordithus,I have not been there!  It's way up the shore
09-06-2020T19:54:09,Ordithus,Basically Canada
09-06-2020T19:54:15,Ordithus,Looks awesome though
09-06-2020T19:54:20,Ordithus,The ferry is closed this year I think
09-06-2020T19:55:21,CrRAR,makes sense
09-06-2020T19:55:58,CrRAR,"Yeah, it's like the last island before canada, looks like there's just campgrounds there"
09-06-2020T19:56:29,CrRAR,Just always found it interesting when I was looking at obscure national park lands

09-06-2020T20:00:47,Ordithus,can't recall if there are still wolves on the island or if they died out
09-06-2020T20:04:16,CrRAR,"I read too much history about things, but freakier is that there was a shipwreck on the northern side of the island and a bunch of the crew were stranded."
09-06-2020T20:04:22,CrRAR,Sad story though
09-06-2020T20:04:57,Ordithus,there are a ton of shipwrecks on Superior.  Many of them took lives
09-06-2020T20:05:59,CrRAR,"yeah, biggest lake in our region is winnipesaukee and it gets scary in storms"
09-06-2020T20:06:15,CrRAR,and that's NOTHING compared to the oceans that the great lakes are
09-06-2020T20:06:48,Ordithus,12 foot waves are not uncommon
09-06-2020T20:07:37,CrRAR,"yeah, bad stuff"
09-06-2020T20:08:22,Ordithus,I know a guy that surfs on it!
09-06-2020T20:08:32,Ordithus,I think he uses a drysuit

09-06-2020T20:14:29,CrRAR,...and possibly pirates
09-06-2020T20:14:41,CrRAR,...and probably not the fun kind
09-06-2020T20:15:27,CrRAR,"Like if pirates wanted to turn a leaf, they could probably just sail the ocean blue and sell rum to people on random beaches they land on."
09-06-2020T20:15:49,CrRAR,genius business strategy
09-06-2020T20:15:51,Ordithus,rum pirates best pirates

09-06-2020T20:17:07,CrRAR,It'd
09-06-2020T20:22:26,Ordithus,$20 for a splash of rum
09-06-2020T20:25:22,CrRAR,dang
09-06-2020T20:25:39,CrRAR,if it was cheap enough I'd settle on petting the parrot
