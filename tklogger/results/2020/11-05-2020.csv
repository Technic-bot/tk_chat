11-05-2020T00:00:44,AspiringNoodle,I still love how much of that movie was hand drawn
11-05-2020T00:00:53,AspiringNoodle,Like the bike / tunnel sequences
11-05-2020T00:01:04,Dadrobit,"IIRC, it was used during the bike sequences."
11-05-2020T00:01:12,Dadrobit,For background stuff.
11-05-2020T00:01:30,Dadrobit,"It was mentioned in the special features, haven't watched it in a few years."
11-05-2020T00:01:46,Dadrobit,Also one of the first to use computers to help record and mix music.
11-05-2020T00:04:19,AspiringNoodle,The one source I'm finding is saying that all backgrounds / light sources were hand-painted
11-05-2020T00:06:05,AspiringNoodle,"Riiiiiiiiiight, that's why I remember Akira as being special"
11-05-2020T00:06:39,AspiringNoodle,The whole film was done in 24 fps.  Every frame was animated.  And apparently some frames had as many as 8 or 9 layers
11-05-2020T00:30:01,Dadrobit,"Watching the special features, and yeah, they did use computer animations."
11-05-2020T00:33:04,AspiringNoodle,Theeeere we go
11-05-2020T00:34:16,AspiringNoodle,"""Computer-generated imagery was also used in the film, primarily to animate the pattern indicator used by Doctor ≈ånish, but it was additionally used to plot the paths of falling objects, model parallax effects on backgrounds, and tweak lighting and lens"
11-05-2020T00:34:19,AspiringNoodle,"flares."""
11-05-2020T00:35:00,AspiringNoodle,I stand corrected :)
11-05-2020T00:35:33,AspiringNoodle,I'm going to bed early.  Night guys!
11-05-2020T00:35:44,Dadrobit,Have a good night.
11-05-2020T00:40:46,SpazztasticKiwi,there are no words for how hard it is to find good cosplay dresses

11-05-2020T03:48:26,SpazztasticKiwi,I did the brilliant thing of downloading a new book at 2 am and just now got myself convinced it might be bedtime
11-05-2020T03:50:51,SpazztasticKiwi,poor Reni - those swimsuits would send me screaming but she looks like she‚Äôs frozen
11-05-2020T03:58:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom did you take a nap or are you sleep working

11-05-2020T04:01:17,SpazztasticKiwi,you know this mother‚Äôs day had me thinking about Nibbly
11-05-2020T04:01:42,SpazztasticKiwi,we know little on her all things considered - I wonder if she knows her parents or if they‚Äôre alive
11-05-2020T04:03:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Nibbly family reunion - nothing but a room of squirrels

11-05-2020T14:10:43,CrimsonQuill,Just finished some crossover fanart and posted it :)

11-05-2020T14:17:49,CrimsonQuill,Hi Jojo
11-05-2020T14:18:27,JojoGD,I just saw it
11-05-2020T14:18:36,CrimsonQuill,I finally finished it
11-05-2020T14:18:39,CrimsonQuill,:)
11-05-2020T14:18:56,JojoGD,I finished that tiger drawing i made

11-05-2020T14:32:49,JojoGD,night terra
11-05-2020T14:34:18,JojoGD,It sound like i was going to cry in my 89% TOE2 fail
11-05-2020T14:36:40,CrimsonQuill,What's TOE2 ?
11-05-2020T14:37:01,JojoGD,short for Therory of Everything 2
11-05-2020T14:37:16,JojoGD,theory
11-05-2020T14:40:53,CrimsonQuill,"Ah, Geometry Dash."
11-05-2020T14:40:55,CrimsonQuill,Well
11-05-2020T14:41:20,CrimsonQuill,I am going to allow more time to inevitably trickle away in the run up to my exam on Friday
11-05-2020T14:41:31,CrimsonQuill,And probably play more Halo on Legendary
11-05-2020T14:41:56,CrimsonQuill,Because a part of me won't feel complete until I've played through every game on the Legendary difficulty.
11-05-2020T14:43:22,JojoGD,Im going to try and beat that level because that is the only level left for me to beat in the main levels
11-05-2020T14:45:58,CrimsonQuill,:)
11-05-2020T14:46:19,JojoGD,I hope i don't get a 80% or above
11-05-2020T14:47:47,JojoGD,After TOE2 its Nine circles
11-05-2020T14:48:03,CrimsonQuill,Good luck
11-05-2020T14:48:15,JojoGD,Thanks
11-05-2020T15:19:08,CrimsonQuill,Thanks
11-05-2020T15:42:10,AspiringNoodle,Well that was eye opening...
11-05-2020T15:42:29,CrimsonQuill,@AspiringNoodle Dark Souls stuff?
11-05-2020T15:43:21,AspiringNoodle,"Nope, another explanation behind wage stagnation, and also another argument for how destructive shareholders will be to capitalism in the long run if we don't put a leash on them"
11-05-2020T15:43:37,CrimsonQuill,I see
11-05-2020T15:43:39,CrimsonQuill,So#
11-05-2020T15:43:58,CrimsonQuill,Any chance the bastards at the top will actually THINK about the long term now?
11-05-2020T15:44:09,CrimsonQuill,Or are we doomed to short term gain and long term pain?
11-05-2020T15:44:13,AspiringNoodle,"Pre-1980's, companies typically invested less than 50% of their profit back into shareholders"
11-05-2020T15:44:31,AspiringNoodle,The remainder was put back into the workers and long-term investments
11-05-2020T15:45:11,AspiringNoodle,"At some point, the directive changed, and now the standard is that 93% of profits go towards the shareholders.  This is now the norm and what is expected."

11-05-2020T15:45:56,AspiringNoodle,"Combine that with the legal obligation corporations have to make money for the shareholders, and it makes a lot of sense."
11-05-2020T15:46:32,AspiringNoodle,Best catch of the day
11-05-2020T15:46:46,AspiringNoodle,"She was catching fish, but then she caught herself a man :ptv-snicker:"
11-05-2020T15:47:17,AspiringNoodle,"So really, the problem is that too much money is being siphoned towards the top."
11-05-2020T15:47:32,CrimsonQuill,...as ever in history...
11-05-2020T15:47:40,CrimsonQuill,takes out their rage on the Covenant
11-05-2020T15:47:43,AspiringNoodle,There are several ways to fix this
11-05-2020T15:48:07,AspiringNoodle,"But tbh, it'll probably be a ""eat the rich"" scenario before they're implemented"

11-05-2020T16:17:03,JojoGD,I plan to make some map art in minecraft

11-05-2020T16:36:27,SpazztasticKiwi,what can haul more
11-05-2020T16:36:37,SpazztasticKiwi,truck or suv
11-05-2020T16:37:22,Dadrobit,I mean. If it's a real truck then a truck can always haul more.
11-05-2020T16:45:25,CrimsonQuill,Back from pain
11-05-2020T16:45:31,CrimsonQuill,Legendary Reach is...wearing
11-05-2020T16:53:36,CrimsonQuill,"I mean, the PC version might just be as hard as Halo 2"
11-05-2020T16:53:42,SpazztasticKiwi,if I actually get a truck it‚Äôs gonna be 4 door 4 wheel

11-05-2020T17:42:35,AspiringNoodle,I'm trying to troubleshoot this mod I installed for Dark Souls 3
11-05-2020T17:42:49,AspiringNoodle,It's SUPPOSED to be protection against hackers / script kiddies
11-05-2020T17:42:57,AspiringNoodle,But I think it's redirecting damage to the wrong target
