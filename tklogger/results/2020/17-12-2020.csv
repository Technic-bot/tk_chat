17-12-2020T21:06:51,SageSaga,Just because something is broken down into just code doesnt mean you have the skill to change that code to make it into something better
17-12-2020T21:07:32,SageSaga,i think it would be easier to cook a new one and scan it  again rather than try to fiddle with the code

17-12-2020T23:31:05,CrRAR,imitation or just BECAUSE?
17-12-2020T23:31:09,Ordithus,so she went for both?

17-12-2020T23:33:09,CrRAR,some of the Templar apprentices from forever ago had differing face marks too
17-12-2020T23:33:40,CrRAR,Like some of the tower watcher and other background ones that appeared occasionally
17-12-2020T23:34:07,CrRAR,some were more just like an outline of a triangle
17-12-2020T23:34:14,GammaEradon,Hey Tom? I had some (SFW) fanart done (by another artist) and was wondering if there'd be any issues posting it?
