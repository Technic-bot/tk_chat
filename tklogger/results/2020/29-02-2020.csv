29-02-2020T00:27:09,JojoF2415,I made my first high contrast drawing
29-02-2020T00:28:44,JojoF2415,It looks crappy but choosing the colors was a pain
29-02-2020T00:43:58,AspiringNoodle,I got super pissed at WoW today xD
29-02-2020T00:44:41,AspiringNoodle,"It's like... oof.  Playing Vulpera has me REALLY happy, but they gotta get it together next expansion"
29-02-2020T01:27:53,JojoF2415,I’ve stopped playing geometry dash temporarily
29-02-2020T01:31:17,AspiringNoodle,I might reevaluate my WoW habits eventually
29-02-2020T01:31:28,AspiringNoodle,Because transmogrification is a HUGE time sink in WoW
29-02-2020T01:31:49,AspiringNoodle,"TLDR: Finding pretty armor and weapons to give you a unique, coordinated look."
29-02-2020T01:32:33,JojoF2415,I finally made some quick digital art
29-02-2020T01:33:01,JojoF2415,Traditional and digital inverted colors is what I worked on today
29-02-2020T01:33:18,AspiringNoodle,Nice
29-02-2020T01:33:27,JojoF2415,Tomorrow that dumb art assignment :ptv-unimpressed:
29-02-2020T01:34:12,JojoF2415,I don’t feel like doing it but I don’t want to take the F
29-02-2020T01:35:32,JojoF2415,:ptv-sneakysmirk:
29-02-2020T01:35:49,JojoF2415,Shoot I pressed the wrong button
29-02-2020T01:36:20,JojoF2415,I accidentally pressed enter when looking what the emote commands say
29-02-2020T01:37:14,JojoF2415,I also planted some Carolina reapers today
29-02-2020T01:43:19,AspiringNoodle,I think part of my frustration with WoW today might also be tied to work[s]
29-02-2020T01:43:35,AspiringNoodle,"I'm currently updating an app for my 2nd job, which is what I needed to do today"
29-02-2020T01:43:57,AspiringNoodle,"Then tomorrow I work a long shift (on a day which I'm not supposed to be worked, mind you. I will be discussing this with work soon)"
29-02-2020T01:44:24,AspiringNoodle,"And so, I'm probably gonna be up until 4 or so so I can get this done, then I gotta wake up at 11 so I can get ready for work at 12"
29-02-2020T01:44:49,AspiringNoodle,"And that's something else I need to keep an eye on.  I'm a 2nd shift only guy, so if I keep having shifts creep up earlier and earlier, that's not cool."
29-02-2020T01:52:52,AspiringNoodle,Uuuuuuugh.  I wish two things were real about this app...
29-02-2020T01:53:37,AspiringNoodle,"1: That it respected starting dates.  If the app actually acknowledged starting dates for coupons, then I wouldn't have to do it the day they're supposed to go live."
29-02-2020T01:54:18,AspiringNoodle,"And I also wouldn't need to do it late at night when businesses are closed so nobody sees / uses the new coupons too soon. (This is just a habit I've developed, and it's wrecking my sleep schedule)"
29-02-2020T01:54:51,AspiringNoodle,2: That the update process wasn't so boring / tedious.  My procrastination tendencies compound with part 1.
29-02-2020T01:55:10,AspiringNoodle,the day before they're supposed to go live*
29-02-2020T01:56:12,JojoF2415,I got a new sketch book
29-02-2020T01:59:16,AspiringNoodle,Cool :D
29-02-2020T01:59:19,AspiringNoodle,Tiny or large?
29-02-2020T01:59:23,JojoF2415,I almost filled out the old one
29-02-2020T01:59:26,JojoF2415,Large
29-02-2020T01:59:54,JojoF2415,I made a drawing on the front cover
29-02-2020T02:00:03,JojoF2415,It’s a black sketch book
29-02-2020T02:05:19,JojoF2415,:ptv-SteelwormHades:
29-02-2020T02:05:34,JojoF2415,Dammit again I hit return
29-02-2020T02:06:54,AspiringNoodle,*yawn*
29-02-2020T02:07:02,AspiringNoodle,"Man, this part is extra boring..."
29-02-2020T02:07:19,AspiringNoodle,To give you how inefficient it is to make a new coupon entry for the app
29-02-2020T02:07:25,AspiringNoodle,I'll be right back about I count
29-02-2020T02:08:03,AspiringNoodle,4 presses of enter
29-02-2020T02:08:55,AspiringNoodle,24 mouse clicks
29-02-2020T02:09:03,AspiringNoodle,6 side mouse clicks (shortcut for windows + v)
29-02-2020T02:09:12,AspiringNoodle,2 scrolls
29-02-2020T02:09:53,AspiringNoodle,the enters are a way for me to avoid needing to click a small button again to create new fields
29-02-2020T02:10:12,JojoF2415,I use a phone for picarto not a computer
29-02-2020T02:11:05,AspiringNoodle,These updates are roughly 4 hours of work
29-02-2020T02:11:22,AspiringNoodle,"But it's ripe for carpal tunnel because it's a lot of small, repetitive fine motor movements"
29-02-2020T02:11:33,JojoF2415,I’m still waiting for gd 2.2 update
29-02-2020T02:11:44,AspiringNoodle,And the only reason it takes 4 hours is because I've got a flow and I use all these little tricks to speed things up
29-02-2020T02:12:06,JojoF2415,It’s been 3 long years
29-02-2020T02:12:14,AspiringNoodle,I can only imagine how long it would take my boss to do this if I said I couldn't do it one week.
29-02-2020T02:12:40,JojoF2415,I saw my middle school counselor
29-02-2020T02:12:58,JojoF2415,At the store
29-02-2020T02:13:28,JojoF2415,She didn’t recognize me
29-02-2020T02:19:38,AspiringNoodle,"Bleh, if I ever go like 20 minutes without responding, it's because of this work"
29-02-2020T02:19:57,AspiringNoodle,"Mentally, I'm about to freakin' lose it.  I really think I shouldn't have taken that 5th day last week..."
29-02-2020T02:21:55,AspiringNoodle,"Combination primary job putting its needs first and me enabling it, and the 2nd job having issues that should have been sorted out a long time ago."

29-02-2020T10:36:53,AspiringNoodle,Morning
29-02-2020T10:37:05,AspiringNoodle,Today might be the day I talk with work
29-02-2020T10:37:28,AspiringNoodle,"I'm tired, I still got to finish this app update, and they got a month of violating my availability"
29-02-2020T10:37:59,AspiringNoodle,I find that over time I'm becoming less of a door mat and I'm becoming more quickly to speak up.\
29-02-2020T11:11:05,SonOfGoku,Good luck Noodle
29-02-2020T11:25:11,AspiringNoodle,*remembers he wants to pay for character animation lessons*
29-02-2020T11:25:44,AspiringNoodle,...I think I'd rather get a full time job programming and get way more money than work full time here and be exhausted xD
29-02-2020T11:26:03,AspiringNoodle,"2nd job, save me :ptv-whiny:"

29-02-2020T16:26:37,ThingsAreMoving,Do you save before you 'try' ?
29-02-2020T16:26:40,Avolendi,Yup. I also recall it being mentioned that the ritual was for pairs to show their dedication and would get close to the fire while the shaman lets it burn high and controls it. Maybe also burning away the clothes. Not sure about that part
29-02-2020T16:26:43,Xexanoth,The problem being that you have to kill them after so you can then marry another one before the next boss fight
29-02-2020T16:26:52,Roughlandin,"I am very comfortable with that backside, Prose"
29-02-2020T16:27:02,AkelaStormclaw,Complete trust in the shaman.
29-02-2020T16:27:18,Roughlandin,I think the ritual involved stepping INTO the fire
29-02-2020T16:27:18,Avolendi,That also yea :P
