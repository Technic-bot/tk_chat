28-02-2020T00:03:15,Sclimshady,:cw0lfmare-EmberPants:
28-02-2020T00:03:25,Roughlandin,Who needs pants?
28-02-2020T00:03:33,CrRAR,nora don't
28-02-2020T00:03:37,KeefMcDerpface,Does that do.
28-02-2020T00:03:39,Ordithus,Nor Kate
28-02-2020T00:03:42,ZRO4825,Sage's character do not either.
28-02-2020T00:03:46,Roughlandin,I see two streams and zero pants
28-02-2020T00:03:47,ZRO4825,Pants would just get in the way at this point.
28-02-2020T00:03:49,Ordithus,"Nor Nami, or Nyna"
28-02-2020T00:04:10,mingun,10:03
28-02-2020T00:04:16,ThingsAreMoving,"How would Nora wear pants, if she wanted to try them? :cthingsaremoving-hmm1:"
28-02-2020T00:04:19,Stormagedon,Pants are pointless at this point
28-02-2020T00:04:22,KeefMcDerpface,WHAT?!
28-02-2020T00:04:25,ZRO4825,Nyna I think just plain doesn't understand any need for pants :rofl:
28-02-2020T00:04:31,SageSaga,this picture is proof Android girls can grow out their hair
28-02-2020T00:04:34,Stormagedon,She wears a dress

28-02-2020T00:04:57,ThingsAreMoving,I memeber
28-02-2020T00:05:04,Ordithus,Pants do not agree with her
28-02-2020T00:05:09,ZRO4825,"Needs more Crazy Android Glowy Eyes looks, Sage. :P"

28-02-2020T00:06:00,KeefMcDerpface,That's more robot than dragon.
28-02-2020T00:06:15,Roughlandin,I got it
28-02-2020T00:06:16,Ordithus,"Fine, Sage"
28-02-2020T00:06:17,henner,"ye casnt tell me that ""sum trash i designed"" aint a good description"
28-02-2020T00:06:23,Ordithus,"Henner, try again please"
28-02-2020T00:06:33,KeefMcDerpface,Before the link.
28-02-2020T00:06:38,KeefMcDerpface,BEFORE!
28-02-2020T00:06:52,SageSaga,its description first- and you can have them in the same message- and no thats a terrible description
28-02-2020T00:07:13,henner,yeah on the outside her skin has been cut into plates and gone through a process that turns her skin into armor
28-02-2020T00:07:17,ThingsAreMoving,"Be proud of your durg, that's some solid art"
28-02-2020T00:07:18,Roughlandin,Gotta be specific. Links can be a scary place
28-02-2020T00:07:25,KeefMcDerpface,True
28-02-2020T00:07:43,ZRO4825,Awesome remix I stumbled across earlier today of Cosmo Canyon from FF7. Nothin but music.  :3  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af27aTI7j2M
28-02-2020T00:07:53,SageSaga,im gonna test to see if Mihari is here
28-02-2020T00:07:53,Roughlandin,It's dangerous to go alone. Take this. :crossed_swords:
28-02-2020T00:07:59,ThingsAreMoving,ZRO showing how it's done
28-02-2020T00:08:23,ZRO4825,"lol, Sage"
28-02-2020T00:08:27,Roughlandin,Good demo and good jamz ZRO
28-02-2020T00:08:29,SageSaga,looks like shes not here
28-02-2020T00:08:48,Roughlandin,Panty test is showing negative
28-02-2020T00:09:10,ZRO4825,"It's less the panties, and more a certain detail about them. :P"
28-02-2020T00:09:31,KeefMcDerpface,And of course we zoom in on them.
28-02-2020T00:09:33,Roughlandin,It's all in the details
28-02-2020T00:09:39,ZRO4825,"oooh, shimapan"
28-02-2020T00:09:42,Roughlandin,Waaaay in those details
28-02-2020T00:09:52,ZRO4825,"And really, who's arguing against zooming in on Nami's booty?"
28-02-2020T00:10:07,Roughlandin,This is fine. I'm fine with this.
28-02-2020T00:10:33,Ordithus,There are worse things to fill the screen
28-02-2020T00:10:34,ZRO4825,":thinking: Ya know, it's kinda funny, the android girls all have their highlight points. Nami got da booty. Toyoko got da titties. Lien can kick your ass and pulls off a great Chun-Li look."
28-02-2020T00:10:47,ZRO4825,Though I like Toyoko's hair best.
28-02-2020T00:10:53,Ordithus,ZRO thanks for music :ctwokinds-rainehappy:
28-02-2020T00:10:55,ZRO4825,Michelle got awesome hair too <3
28-02-2020T00:11:04,ZRO4825,Glad to share. ^^b
28-02-2020T00:11:11,Roughlandin,All girls are best girls
28-02-2020T00:11:24,ZRO4825,And it's an especially awesome track for anyone who was fond of Cosmo Canyon to begin with.
28-02-2020T00:11:29,Roughlandin,Mihari is best chat girl
28-02-2020T00:11:29,ZRO4825,Like myself. :3
28-02-2020T00:11:38,Roughlandin,...Yeah she ain't here
28-02-2020T00:11:44,ThingsAreMoving,I feel like that hole for the tail needs to be reinforced with some sort of seam to prevent ripping
28-02-2020T00:11:48,ZRO4825,"No sucking up to Mihari, she'll still slap you silly. :P"
28-02-2020T00:11:55,SageSaga,Mihari is still sick so she probably dozed off
28-02-2020T00:11:56,ZRO4825,hides.
28-02-2020T00:12:10,ZRO4825,"awww, she's sick? Did not know. That sucks. :(  Hope she gets better."
28-02-2020T00:12:10,ThingsAreMoving,undergarments are not made out of sturdy materials
28-02-2020T00:12:38,ZRO4825,"Of course not. No one wants to sit on ""sturdy"""
28-02-2020T00:12:39,Roughlandin,I've seen the stuff Mihari gets comissioned. A Cheet can slap me all day any day
28-02-2020T00:13:00,SageSaga,Mihari doesnt get a lot of commissions
28-02-2020T00:13:08,SageSaga,and usually when she does its SFW stuff
28-02-2020T00:13:33,ZRO4825,"Can attest. I see a lot of the stuff that gets done of her, like....1 out of every 5, if even that many, is actually of her own commissions."
28-02-2020T00:13:34,SageSaga,unfortunately shes often paid for SFW commissions and gotten back NSFW ones
28-02-2020T00:13:48,ZRO4825,Well that's some bullshit. Why would an artist do that? >:(
28-02-2020T00:13:49,Roughlandin,Fair enough. Not judging
28-02-2020T00:14:18,SageSaga,"one was like ""When i looked up your character and saw all the porn i thought this would be better!"""
28-02-2020T00:14:23,Ordithus,Ugh
28-02-2020T00:14:28,ZRO4825,"Don't get me wrong, her cheetah's awesome in both a SFW and NSFW viewpoint, but an artist should be drawing what they get asked to draw, one would think...either that or refuse it if they don't wanna draw it."
28-02-2020T00:14:33,ZRO4825,"Okay, yeah, that's not cool reasoning."
28-02-2020T00:14:54,ThingsAreMoving,I thought when you commision someone you can actually see a draft before you ok it and get it drawn properly
28-02-2020T00:15:09,SageSaga,yeah the draft was SFW
28-02-2020T00:15:16,SageSaga,the final version was not
28-02-2020T00:15:19,ZRO4825,"That's how it SHOULD work, Things."
28-02-2020T00:15:20,ThingsAreMoving,"wow, dick move"
28-02-2020T00:15:27,Roughlandin,Yeah really not. I was mostly talking about Fluff's stuff on her. I thought it was commissioned
28-02-2020T00:15:40,ZRO4825,Nah. Most of Fluff's stuff is other people asking for Mihari.
28-02-2020T00:15:42,Roughlandin,I mean that's really a dick move
28-02-2020T00:15:43,SageSaga,a lot of the fluff stuff was gifts but some was commissioned
28-02-2020T00:15:51,Zakuru,wow i'd be pissed
28-02-2020T00:15:53,ZRO4825,"Well, yeah, what Sage said too."
28-02-2020T00:15:57,SageSaga,there are also people who commission stuff for her- and thats a lot of porn too
28-02-2020T00:16:12,Ordithus,I hope they at least get her permission
28-02-2020T00:16:12,ZRO4825,And I see Mihari get requested from artists for monthly stuff and such a lot too.
28-02-2020T00:16:31,Roughlandin,I think some people don't know she's actually a person. For a while I thought she was just one of Fluff's OCs
28-02-2020T00:16:32,SageSaga,yeah Scorp is a good friend
28-02-2020T00:16:35,ThingsAreMoving,being a recognizable figure will do that
28-02-2020T00:16:48,ThingsAreMoving,the internet is a spiteful being
28-02-2020T00:16:53,ZRO4825,"She's kinda hit popufur status honestly, and sadly people take that as permission to use her character at liberty."
28-02-2020T00:17:00,SageSaga,he draws a ton of Mihari stuff and a lot of it is SFW but also a lot of NSFW
28-02-2020T00:17:11,SageSaga,but hes never done a NSFW image when she asked for a SFW one
28-02-2020T00:17:14,ZRO4825,"Scorp draws some of the best Mihari, won't lie~"
28-02-2020T00:17:19,steelabjur,"Dang, a non-anthro character shouldn't be s sexy, but somehow Nora pulls it off."
28-02-2020T00:17:32,ZRO4825,"I actually just love Scorp's style overall, it just flows so good."
28-02-2020T00:17:37,Roughlandin,Yeah I wouldn't think Fluff would do something like that
28-02-2020T00:17:38,KeefMcDerpface,That Nora for you.
28-02-2020T00:18:04,Roughlandin,I'm pretty sure Nora invented the concept of sexy in TK lore
28-02-2020T00:18:05,SageSaga,a lot of people think Mihari belongs to Fluff though so thats annoying too
28-02-2020T00:18:41,ThingsAreMoving,people are weird like that
28-02-2020T00:18:53,ZRO4825,"That's...I honestly don't understand how someone could make that mistake, because Fluff pretty clearly labels her as her own character in nearly everything's description."
28-02-2020T00:18:53,ThingsAreMoving,they prefer not to source stuff but work on assumptions
28-02-2020T00:19:04,ZRO4825,Unless they're only finding it on e621 or something.
28-02-2020T00:19:15,Twokinds,Done
28-02-2020T00:19:15,Roughlandin,"Yeah I can see how that'd be annoying. But yeah, Fluff always credits her on his FA posts at least"
28-02-2020T00:19:16,ZRO4825,Even then the description is still put on there half the time anyway.
28-02-2020T00:19:20,Roughlandin,Nice Tom
28-02-2020T00:19:22,jirka,Lady Nora ( Nora Cards ) Very Nice Tom :thumbsup:
28-02-2020T00:19:26,ZRO4825,"Good work, Tom. ^^b"
28-02-2020T00:19:27,SageSaga,"its why i break up ""look- if the artist that drew Mihari first is the one that owns her- then shes mine! but thats not how it works- Mihari is Mihari's"""
28-02-2020T00:19:29,Ordithus,"Lovely Nora, Tom!"
28-02-2020T00:19:29,CrRAR,smashing!
28-02-2020T00:19:40,ThingsAreMoving,"Absolutely fantastic, Tom"
28-02-2020T00:19:42,iliar,Thanks Tom. Very cool.
28-02-2020T00:19:52,Ordithus,"It's a nice view, too"
28-02-2020T00:19:52,ZRO4825,"What WAS the first image of Mihari, Sage? Do you still have it around?"
28-02-2020T00:19:55,SageSaga,and No- Fluff doesnt always Credit
28-02-2020T00:20:01,ThingsAreMoving,"Thanks for carding her, Illiar <3"
28-02-2020T00:20:03,ThingsAreMoving,More durgs
28-02-2020T00:20:07,SageSaga,yeah its on my DA
28-02-2020T00:20:09,ZRO4825,Then we shall yell at Fluff for not doing that. >:V
28-02-2020T00:20:14,KeefMcDerpface,Nice Tom
28-02-2020T00:20:15,steelabjur,Sexy Dragon/10
28-02-2020T00:20:18,ZRO4825,...once he's back from vacation.
28-02-2020T00:20:22,ZRO4825,:joy:
28-02-2020T00:20:23,SageSaga,Mihari isnt credited in that porn comic he did of her
28-02-2020T00:20:24,Roughlandin,Eh not crediting stuff doesn't help things
28-02-2020T00:20:37,ThingsAreMoving,can confirm
28-02-2020T00:20:41,ThingsAreMoving,not helping me
28-02-2020T00:20:47,ZRO4825,He didn't credit her for Predators of Kilimanjaro? wth Fluff -.-
28-02-2020T00:21:03,Stormagedon,Would that be Plagiarism to a point?
28-02-2020T00:21:23,ZRO4825,"Not since he used her character with permission, but still kinda wth to not properly credit her character to her~"
28-02-2020T00:21:23,Roughlandin,Yeah now that I think about it I don't think he linked her. I'm sure he got permission to feature her though right?
28-02-2020T00:21:47,ZRO4825,"It's been brought up before, but I don't remember where, in a chat before, but yeah, he did ask to use her cheetah for that."
28-02-2020T00:21:51,SageSaga,he had permission but its bad form to not credit her
28-02-2020T00:22:09,Roughlandin,Yeah that's problematic
28-02-2020T00:22:15,Ordithus,[I can be your pillow]*:ctwokinds-NoraEyebrows:

28-02-2020T00:25:08,ThingsAreMoving,"Nice color change there, Rough."

28-02-2020T00:25:29,SageSaga,its really annoying having your character used by mentally challenged children for adult Role playing

28-02-2020T00:30:17,Roughlandin,"Like, why can't people come up with their OWN characters? Use a little creativity!"
28-02-2020T00:30:33,ThingsAreMoving,but that's effort
28-02-2020T00:30:43,ThingsAreMoving,why not just CONSUME CONSUME CONSUME

28-02-2020T00:30:58,Roughlandin,It's not even that hard. I am bear. I am kind of a hick. I am kind of a dork. That's my sona
28-02-2020T00:31:14,Roughlandin,"It's essentially just me, but a bear"
28-02-2020T00:31:18,SageSaga,and since copyright is such a mess sometimes she has to ask Artists to do a DMC takedown since even though the character is hers they dont look at that and rather the person they can prove who made the art
28-02-2020T00:31:32,ThingsAreMoving,"I am a human, I like anthro art. This is my sona."
28-02-2020T00:31:34,ThingsAreMoving,lol

28-02-2020T00:32:50,Stormagedon,What is a clasification for a sona?
28-02-2020T00:33:00,Roughlandin,Mine is a bear face

28-02-2020T00:34:11,Roughlandin,I think my pic on SF and FA are still the Charmin bear. Which is... kind of morally dubious. But I figure everyone knows I don't OWN the charmin bears

28-02-2020T00:41:04,Stormagedon,why do we quote things
28-02-2020T00:41:25,SageSaga,my current song is from Jojo
28-02-2020T00:41:33,Roughlandin,"Because we're not original enough to come up with our own clever things to say, Storm."
28-02-2020T00:41:44,SageSaga,ending theme from Diamond is Unbreakable

28-02-2020T00:42:05,LannAF,"yeah but it'd be wrong of me to say it's purely a jojo song, it's definitely -in- jojo."
28-02-2020T00:42:14,Roughlandin,That is my extent of JoJo knowledge.
28-02-2020T00:42:17,LannAF,I think I personally like josuke the best just in terms of personality.
28-02-2020T00:42:58,Roughlandin,Dangit Lann! Now I've got that Savage Garden song stuck in my head!
28-02-2020T00:43:03,SageSaga,i will always like Jotaru probably the most

28-02-2020T00:44:26,Roughlandin,No Game No Life yo
28-02-2020T00:44:29,SageSaga,im not saying hes the best- just that i like him- because hes a classic tough guy who deep down is a softy that just wants to be a marine biologist
28-02-2020T00:44:33,SpazztasticKiwi,I got werk in 9 hours
28-02-2020T00:44:47,SageSaga,because he likes dolphins

28-02-2020T00:58:15,Ordithus,Give Nami long hair and look what happens
28-02-2020T00:58:17,Stormagedon,Dragon or Human Akela?
28-02-2020T00:58:24,AkelaStormclaw,Derg
28-02-2020T00:58:35,Stormagedon,Nice
28-02-2020T00:58:49,Roughlandin,A smol dergum is fine
28-02-2020T00:58:50,SageSaga,this is Nami from Yosh!
28-02-2020T00:59:20,SageSaga,she has a very similar hair color to Nyna though- and this is her wearing cat ears and a tail- so i can see people getting it mixed up
28-02-2020T00:59:25,ZRO4825,I always figured Nami would just be even better with long hair. <3
28-02-2020T00:59:36,ZRO4825,"I may be biased, I admit."
28-02-2020T01:00:39,SageSaga,"Nami is taller than Nyna, and her butt and hips arent as big as Nynas XD"
28-02-2020T01:01:34,Ordithus,But who is more human? :ctwokinds-floraquestion:
28-02-2020T01:01:43,Roughlandin,More human than human?
28-02-2020T01:02:03,SageSaga,neither- Nyna is not human at all being a Nekomata and Nami can pass for human but she is 100% android
28-02-2020T01:03:08,Roughlandin,Fun fact: More Human than Human is actually a reference to androids
28-02-2020T01:03:08,Ordithus,Clearly the answer was Rieko
28-02-2020T01:03:15,Roughlandin,"...Or replicants, rather"
28-02-2020T01:04:27,SageSaga,let's see what i gotta draw for AI tonight
28-02-2020T01:04:44,AspiringNoodle,Hey Ord <3
28-02-2020T01:04:47,JojoF2415,Im alive

28-02-2020T01:04:55,KeefMcDerpface,Yay!
28-02-2020T01:05:19,KeefMcDerpface,How many fish did you catch?
28-02-2020T01:05:35,JojoF2415,0 :ptv-sad:
28-02-2020T01:06:13,AspiringNoodle,:c
28-02-2020T01:06:21,Roughlandin,A day with no fish is still better than a day without fishing
28-02-2020T01:06:29,Roughlandin,Bears know these things
28-02-2020T01:06:30,KeefMcDerpface,:fish:
28-02-2020T01:06:46,Roughlandin,Keef gives +1 pish

28-02-2020T01:07:22,KeefMcDerpface,:whale2:
28-02-2020T01:07:23,JojoF2415,That bird that stole my bait earlier couldn’t open the bag
28-02-2020T01:07:36,Stormagedon,"Quick poll, who likes Kat?"
28-02-2020T01:07:55,KeefMcDerpface,The real question is who doesn't like Kat.
28-02-2020T01:08:03,Roughlandin,^^^It would be easier to ask who DOESN'T like Kat
28-02-2020T01:08:08,Roughlandin,Shorter list
28-02-2020T01:08:14,Roughlandin,"...I like Kat, btw"
28-02-2020T01:08:18,KeefMcDerpface,^
28-02-2020T01:08:19,JojoF2415,I have too many drawings of Kat
28-02-2020T01:08:31,Roughlandin,Never too many drawings of Kat
28-02-2020T01:08:41,Stormagedon,"Thats a good question, I don't want to ask for favorates between the two..."
28-02-2020T01:08:48,JojoF2415,Well not too many but I’ve drawn her the most
28-02-2020T01:09:10,Roughlandin,No need to pick favorites. All TK girls are best girls.
28-02-2020T01:09:17,KeefMcDerpface,^
28-02-2020T01:09:17,Roughlandin,Even Mike.
28-02-2020T01:09:22,KeefMcDerpface,pfft
28-02-2020T01:09:23,Roughlandin,Even Brutus
28-02-2020T01:09:24,JojoF2415,Lol
28-02-2020T01:09:27,KeefMcDerpface,haha
28-02-2020T01:09:41,JojoF2415,Fem Brutus
28-02-2020T01:09:51,KeefMcDerpface,Just through in everyone why don't you.
28-02-2020T01:09:52,Ordithus,Imagine the booy on fem Brutus
28-02-2020T01:09:59,Ordithus,*booty
28-02-2020T01:10:09,Roughlandin,I've got a suggest lined up
28-02-2020T01:10:37,Roughlandin,Brutus/Clovis genderswap. Brutus is bamboozled why the Boss is still male
28-02-2020T01:12:07,Roughlandin,That's gonna have to wait though. Next week's is going to be Mike wearing the dress Kat made in Dress Time... Only he already switched back to male
28-02-2020T01:12:27,Roughlandin,I have a feeling he'll still probably look pretty good in it.
28-02-2020T01:12:33,Stormagedon,Yee
28-02-2020T01:12:46,KeefMcDerpface,But that dress is tailored to Fem-Mike.
28-02-2020T01:13:06,Roughlandin,You underestimate Kat's tailoring skills
28-02-2020T01:13:44,Roughlandin,...Also an ill-fitting dress would still probably look pretty good on Mike.
28-02-2020T01:13:51,Stormagedon,Goddess of tailoring
28-02-2020T01:14:10,Roughlandin,Mostly because it'd be hard to make something look bad on Mike. Boy is a boi
28-02-2020T01:14:34,AkelaStormclaw,"What if Clovis somehow severed the link between Nat and Zen, sending nat into a coma. In an effort to save her, Trace merged her soul with Keith's. When they wake up, chaos ensues."
28-02-2020T01:14:56,AkelaStormclaw,Just a quick thought
28-02-2020T01:15:13,Roughlandin,That sounds less chaotic and more like a VERY close relationship
28-02-2020T01:15:15,MelkCoffee,hey there! mind if i join the multi? :ptv-hearts:
28-02-2020T01:15:19,Ordithus,"I wouldn't let Trace near anyones soul, but yeah chaos."
28-02-2020T01:15:52,AkelaStormclaw,Also an extreemley close relationship.
28-02-2020T01:16:05,AkelaStormclaw,Like landin said.
28-02-2020T01:16:33,SageSaga,Sorry Melk- I generally only multi with people I know
28-02-2020T01:16:47,Roughlandin,"Relationships are often chaotic. Keith and Nat don't need much help there. The poor, adorable kids."
28-02-2020T01:17:31,AkelaStormclaw,#keithtani4eva
28-02-2020T01:18:04,Roughlandin,*Cough* TheRealProtagonists *Cough*
28-02-2020T01:18:11,AkelaStormclaw,Yea.
28-02-2020T01:18:36,AkelaStormclaw,Just get married already!
28-02-2020T01:19:08,Roughlandin,Don't rush them! They doin fine at their own pace. Mind ya business
28-02-2020T01:19:19,AkelaStormclaw,Lol ooof.
28-02-2020T01:19:36,Roughlandin,"It's fine. Folk get eager, I understand"
28-02-2020T01:22:24,Roughlandin,Eeeeeh I need bed soon. Need to get up and try to actually get some writing done tomorrow.
28-02-2020T01:23:05,AkelaStormclaw,If it dosent get added to the comic I'm writing a fanfic about it.
28-02-2020T01:23:26,KeefMcDerpface,The soul thing between Keith and Nat?
28-02-2020T01:23:30,AkelaStormclaw,Ye
28-02-2020T01:23:55,Roughlandin,Don't know how I can knock out 700 words in like an hour in a comment on one of Tom's sketches but the story I'm actually trying to write has been sitting at 300 words all week
28-02-2020T01:24:21,PeterAndCompany,"Evening, folks!"
28-02-2020T01:24:32,KeefMcDerpface,Hello
28-02-2020T01:24:36,Roughlandin,Hi ho
28-02-2020T01:24:37,AkelaStormclaw,Anyone heard Two Steps From Hell Evergreen?
28-02-2020T01:24:41,AkelaStormclaw,It's good.
28-02-2020T01:24:57,henner,no
28-02-2020T01:25:08,SageSaga,yo Pete
28-02-2020T01:25:10,Roughlandin,I'm familiar with TSFH but not that song
28-02-2020T01:25:16,PeterAndCompany,"Oooo double stream, neat!"
28-02-2020T01:25:18,PeterAndCompany,Heya Sage!
28-02-2020T01:25:21,CrimsonHelsing,How 'bout the orchestral version of Turbo Killer
28-02-2020T01:25:26,Ordithus,Stripes :ptv-excited:
28-02-2020T01:25:31,Roughlandin,Double stream! Comin outta both barrels
28-02-2020T01:25:35,FoxxTrotter,"E'lo, Jon."
28-02-2020T01:25:42,PeterAndCompany,Hiya Foxx! :D
28-02-2020T01:25:53,SageSaga,Jon- we've never met in person right?
28-02-2020T01:26:06,Roughlandin,"Hello, Jon. Hello, Jon. Hello, Jon."
28-02-2020T01:26:08,PeterAndCompany,I'm not sure? Depends on if you're on the East Coast or not.
28-02-2020T01:26:28,PeterAndCompany,"If you've ever been to FurTheMore or FA United (specifically in 2018), then it's possible!"
28-02-2020T01:26:32,SageSaga,I am- but we never really talked to eachother in the katbox
28-02-2020T01:26:54,PeterAndCompany,"Ahh yes. I wanted to connect more with folks in the Katbox, honestly. It was/is a great group of people."
28-02-2020T01:27:10,AkelaStormclaw,Wots Katbox?
28-02-2020T01:27:22,KeefMcDerpface,A box for Kat.
28-02-2020T01:27:24,SageSaga,a webcomic group we used to be part of
28-02-2020T01:27:29,PeterAndCompany,Aye.
28-02-2020T01:27:35,SageSaga,still are kinda but its not what it used to be
28-02-2020T01:27:39,AkelaStormclaw,"I'm not an OG, so i had no clu."
28-02-2020T01:28:13,PeterAndCompany,Yeah it's no longer a HOST for the webcomics. More like a scattered community. The Discord is really the main point of contact for everyone now.
28-02-2020T01:28:17,SageSaga,i know a lot of us made it to Anthrocon last year but i never got introduced to a bunch of the people
28-02-2020T01:28:32,PeterAndCompany,"I didn't make it to Anthrocon yet. Whitney and I really want to go one year, though."
28-02-2020T01:28:42,ZRO4825,Make it this year! :P
28-02-2020T01:28:44,SageSaga,i'll be there again this year
28-02-2020T01:28:46,ZRO4825,I
28-02-2020T01:28:48,SageSaga,with Tom
28-02-2020T01:28:52,ZRO4825,I'm gonna do my best to get up there this year.
28-02-2020T01:29:02,PeterAndCompany,Would if we could! Trouble is finding a babysitter for Lena.
28-02-2020T01:29:13,SageSaga,ah yeah
28-02-2020T01:29:14,PeterAndCompany,"We're planning to hit FurTheMore '20 next weekend, though"
28-02-2020T01:29:15,ZRO4825,"oof, yeah, can't argue that, babysitters can be a pain"
28-02-2020T01:29:22,PeterAndCompany,I'm registered to host a panel
28-02-2020T01:29:26,AkelaStormclaw,Havent been there yet. Partially because I have no suit.
28-02-2020T01:29:37,ZRO4825,Where's that at?
28-02-2020T01:29:44,PeterAndCompany,"Crystal City, VA"
28-02-2020T01:29:50,PeterAndCompany,Near DC.
28-02-2020T01:29:54,AkelaStormclaw,And partially because its on the other end of the country from me.
28-02-2020T01:29:54,ZRO4825,:thinking:
28-02-2020T01:30:02,FoxxTrotter,"Arlington area, ZRO."
28-02-2020T01:30:05,Stormagedon,Thats a long way from me
28-02-2020T01:30:15,SpazztasticKiwi,everything hurts and I have work tomorrow
28-02-2020T01:30:17,SageSaga,im in VA- but im not in the northern area
28-02-2020T01:30:19,ZRO4825,'bout a 5 hour drive from me.
28-02-2020T01:30:22,SpazztasticKiwi,is this the adult times
28-02-2020T01:30:29,PeterAndCompany,Yeah we're in the northern area
28-02-2020T01:30:30,SageSaga,im actually pretty close to where Danny lives
28-02-2020T01:30:33,PeterAndCompany,Whitney's family is from southern VA
28-02-2020T01:30:35,FoxxTrotter,It's about four hours away from me.
28-02-2020T01:30:38,Roughlandin,"Welcome to the Old, Spazz"
28-02-2020T01:30:50,SageSaga,Danny and I are on the outerbanks area
28-02-2020T01:31:07,PeterAndCompany,Ahhh Danny! We hung out with him for ramen and sushi a couple times lol
28-02-2020T01:31:19,Roughlandin,Cons are far and I am poor and DEEP deep in that closet fur life
28-02-2020T01:31:20,AkelaStormclaw,i eventually wanna join the dance comp with my mad staff spinning skills...
28-02-2020T01:31:20,SageSaga,hes a cool chill guy
28-02-2020T01:31:29,PeterAndCompany,"He was just in the area recently but I didn't get to hang out with him, it was too last-minute"
28-02-2020T01:32:28,SageSaga,the Katbox used to meet up in VA for Nekocon- but they changed some things- <_<
28-02-2020T01:32:45,PeterAndCompany,I really wish I had had a chance to see everyone in person.
28-02-2020T01:32:46,JojoF2415,Only events near where I live is comic con
28-02-2020T01:32:55,Roughlandin,Same jojo
28-02-2020T01:32:57,PeterAndCompany,"Whitney, too. She wanted to meet everyone at some point."
28-02-2020T01:33:22,AkelaStormclaw,"Oh yeah I'm writing a webcomic. Not done w the first page yet, tho"
28-02-2020T01:33:28,SageSaga,well financially Anthrocon has been the best for most of us
28-02-2020T01:33:52,SageSaga,even me and i dont really do anthro really XD
28-02-2020T01:33:57,henner,i dont go to any events.
28-02-2020T01:34:08,PeterAndCompany,"Webcomics are fun and great practice, Akela! :)"
28-02-2020T01:34:13,PeterAndCompany,Good luck getting yours off the ground!
28-02-2020T01:34:21,JojoF2415,Most anthrocons I hear about are on the other side of the country
28-02-2020T01:34:25,henner,also im not much into furry stuff twokinds bieng one of the few acceptions
28-02-2020T01:34:33,henner,yo jojo ur back
28-02-2020T01:34:34,AspiringNoodle,Not sure I have the confidence to try something like a webcomic :ptv-uneasy:
28-02-2020T01:34:41,KeefMcDerpface,Same henner same.
28-02-2020T01:34:41,henner,how was ur fishing trip?
28-02-2020T01:34:59,AkelaStormclaw,Total closet furry here.
28-02-2020T01:35:04,Roughlandin,Same Akela
28-02-2020T01:35:07,JojoF2415,0 fish :ptv-sad:
28-02-2020T01:35:33,PeterAndCompany,I've got two comics that my wife and I publish. One I've been doing for 15 years now.
28-02-2020T01:36:04,JojoF2415,I draw furry stuff ever since I read Twokinds. I’ve kept it hidden though. Only my friends know about it
28-02-2020T01:36:10,AkelaStormclaw,"I might call mine "" Middle Space"" its a play on middle earth and outer space."
28-02-2020T01:36:13,henner,ahh
28-02-2020T01:36:40,Corinthian,This is turning out cute!
28-02-2020T01:36:45,SageSaga,Peter and Company has been going on almost as long as Twokinds and Yosh!
28-02-2020T01:36:52,Roughlandin,I don't know that I'd even tell my closest IRL friends honestly. I'm weird enough as is
28-02-2020T01:37:16,JojoF2415,I’m not a social person. I only have a few friends
28-02-2020T01:37:20,SageSaga,i remember seeing it when it was pretty early- back when i had time to go through all other webcomics at the time
28-02-2020T01:37:32,PeterAndCompany,Yep! And in fact this is just in its current form. Peter & Company was originally a newspaper strip that I started back in 1998 in high school.
28-02-2020T01:37:45,PeterAndCompany,"2005 saw a full wipe and reboot with the ""Guardian"" storyline, which is where I start counting from now."
28-02-2020T01:37:55,Roughlandin,"Plus, in all honesty, other than TK, the anthro artists I watch are basically just... straight porn"
28-02-2020T01:37:56,SageSaga,yeah i think i remember hearing that
28-02-2020T01:37:57,JojoF2415,My friends are ok with the furry drawings but I try not to bring it up
28-02-2020T01:38:09,ZRO4825,Sage has talked a few times about nuking the early parts of Yosh like that if he ever gets time :P
28-02-2020T01:38:12,PeterAndCompany,"I was like, 300+ strips into the series when I realized it just hit a brick wall lol"
28-02-2020T01:38:16,PeterAndCompany,Ran out of stories to tell
28-02-2020T01:38:27,SageSaga,if I could train an AI to draw for me-
28-02-2020T01:38:31,AspiringNoodle,This is proving to be a pretty insightful stream
28-02-2020T01:38:39,AspiringNoodle,"Careful Sage, that might happen one day, lol"
28-02-2020T01:38:45,ZRO4825,"Best suggestion I got for ya, Sage, is to train someone to line/flats for ya. :P"
28-02-2020T01:38:55,Roughlandin,Welcome to late night Real Talk with a bunch of pervy closet furs

28-02-2020T01:57:05,AkelaStormclaw,"No, but making ME sad is."
28-02-2020T01:57:17,SageSaga,Unsteddy- if it was- a lot of people would be banned
28-02-2020T01:57:17,Roughlandin,We care henner. We care.

28-02-2020T01:57:33,Ordithus,"I dunno teddy, this is pretty gay https://www.deviantart.com/twokinds/art/Evals-x-Mike-794189289"

28-02-2020T01:57:56,henner,well there is some confusion there
28-02-2020T01:58:11,AkelaStormclaw,Is natani gay or straight?
28-02-2020T01:58:12,SageSaga,that's just two bros sharing a bed-nothing gay about that... wait a minute!
28-02-2020T01:58:16,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Just some bros wishing each other good night
28-02-2020T01:58:18,Roughlandin,There's a REALLY old sketch of guy Kat/Flora that's also in contention

28-02-2020T01:58:51,unsteddyphoenix,Flora has become far straighter over the years
28-02-2020T01:58:53,henner,"it hints if mike might be gay, but it was made to sound like what most likely happened there was mike trolling evals for what happened when nora turned mike into a girl"
28-02-2020T01:59:05,Roughlandin,...Thank you henner.
28-02-2020T01:59:26,unsteddyphoenix,"If your homies needs a brojob to get to sleep, you really gonna leave him hangin?"

28-02-2020T15:24:26,TerraTheWizard,looks like the page got the wrong number in the archive @twokinds
28-02-2020T15:24:57,SageSaga,I will attempt to start the stream again in an hour and see if it clears up

28-02-2020T15:35:59,TerraTheWizard,so i'm guessing maeve's involvement in this chapter got rewritten?
28-02-2020T15:36:06,TerraTheWizard,http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/1023/ she was on the cover page
28-02-2020T15:36:42,IronHorseComics,possibly
28-02-2020T15:37:54,Mediawatcher,"This is gonna be a crazy upcoming chapter! Chapter 21, here we go!"

28-02-2020T16:21:37,Twokinds,"Maeve was planned to make an apperance when I first plotted out this chapter. But over time events got shifted around, and her part just ended up being pushed back more than I thought."

28-02-2020T16:22:51,IronHorseComics,it happens
28-02-2020T16:22:55,RimaDraws,it was still a great chapter tom
28-02-2020T16:23:23,Twokinds,"There was no way to force her in earlier without negatively impacting the story's flow, so her time will be later. Sorry ^^"

28-02-2020T16:25:09,RimaDraws,well  i still loved this chapter. and it has to probably be the most suspenseful since when they went to the isles
28-02-2020T16:25:40,Twokinds,Thanks! I'm glad :D
28-02-2020T16:26:00,RimaDraws,i mean hell i was looking forward to rose being human for a while if it were possible and it was

28-02-2020T16:31:36,Roughlandin,Either or. Morning Ritual is the more sinister sounding I think

28-02-2020T19:51:45,CrRAR,"Yeah it was all the rage in 2011, probably still a sensation."

28-02-2020T19:53:47,AspiringNoodle,"Four Loko is popular because it tastes good, and has a high alcohol content ($2.49 where I live for a 25oz can @ 14% alc/vol)"

28-02-2020T19:54:34,AspiringNoodle,"But it also is caffeinated, and apparently there's enough energy stuff in them to interfere with the body's ability to blackout when consuming too much alcohol"
28-02-2020T19:55:09,AspiringNoodle,"So, per usual, stupid kids getting blackout drunk, but the drink was preventing them from blacking out."
28-02-2020T19:55:24,AspiringNoodle,So they just kept drinking.  Sounds about right / darwin award in action.
28-02-2020T19:55:25,CrRAR,"yeah, hyper-active impaired judgement"

28-02-2020T19:56:18,SpazztasticKiwi,caffeine opens the blood vessels as an upper and then crashes you as it wears off

28-02-2020T19:59:09,AspiringNoodle,"Okay, real talk, if you could be an anthro, what species would you be? xD"
28-02-2020T20:08:01,IronHorseComics,"uhhhh, good question"
28-02-2020T20:10:14,IronHorseComics,"probably either a dog, a snake (naga kind, I want to eat large and have it not affect me dangit), or a... yeah just one of those two"

28-02-2020T20:26:13,AspiringNoodle,"Not sure what else, tbh..."
28-02-2020T20:26:30,AspiringNoodle,Maybe a gecko or something like that if I looked like what Vader-san depicts them as.
28-02-2020T20:28:14,AspiringNoodle,Dragons (if only they were real lul)
28-02-2020T20:30:37,AspiringNoodle,...I wonder what an anthro Pangolin would look like
28-02-2020T20:34:18,CrRAR,"Immelmann's had a few pangolin characters over the years, Roland in Concession and there's Rhoda in OoTBD. The style is more cartoony though, newer comic series is kind of lovecraftian type horror."
28-02-2020T20:35:08,CrRAR,"Sci-fi Noir Lovecraftian Mystery Drama, it's a weird genre. xD"
28-02-2020T20:38:59,CrRAR,"There was also Ballerina Mafia, more of a panel a day simpler format, and around the same time ""At the Heart of it all"" a more introspective, haunting series that was quite interesting."
28-02-2020T20:58:45,SpazztasticKiwi,without context: would you guys say an infants head is the size of a cats
28-02-2020T20:58:59,SpazztasticKiwi,or thereabouts
