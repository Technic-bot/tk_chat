11-07-2020T00:00:10,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’ve heard that nortan or something virus protector is so bad, someone got it & it detected itself as a virus & deleted itself"
11-07-2020T00:00:56,Ordithus,it hurts itself in its confusion
11-07-2020T00:01:09,SpazztasticKiwi,in a nutshell
11-07-2020T00:04:34,AspiringNoodle,LMAO
11-07-2020T00:05:20,AspiringNoodle,"Hey ord, what was your bet on the ""continuity"" being related to brain scans?"
11-07-2020T00:05:58,Ordithus,"pretty clear - ""you"" are a robot with the conciousness of a person many years before from that brain scan"
11-07-2020T00:06:10,Ordithus,"to you, it was a blink"
11-07-2020T00:06:27,AspiringNoodle,"Well, you're right, lol"
11-07-2020T00:06:35,Ordithus,"and now here you are, better, faster, stronger"
11-07-2020T00:06:44,AspiringNoodle,"Apparently the concept was thought up by Mark Sarang, someone who killed themselves"
11-07-2020T00:06:53,AspiringNoodle,He was an intelligence officer at the facility
11-07-2020T00:07:40,AspiringNoodle,"He understood that for a split second, right as the scan finishes, you and the copy are one and the same.  But after that you start diverging"
11-07-2020T00:08:00,AspiringNoodle,"And so, in order to ""live on"" inside the ARK, you need to kill yourself as the scan completes, or shortly after"
11-07-2020T00:08:39,Ordithus,such senseless violence
11-07-2020T00:08:48,AspiringNoodle,At least he was efficient
11-07-2020T00:09:16,AspiringNoodle,"He folded cyanide salts into some chewing gum, and killed himself after Catherine informed him the scan was done"
11-07-2020T00:09:44,SpazztasticKiwi,did anyone else see Tom & Marks moms post this morning
11-07-2020T00:10:22,Ordithus,no
11-07-2020T00:11:00,AspiringNoodle,"I want to see, tho"

11-07-2020T00:11:46,SpazztasticKiwi,my eyes went straight to Mark’s phone ~just~ off the edge so close to his elbow
11-07-2020T00:12:08,Ordithus,mine went to the food
11-07-2020T00:12:20,SpazztasticKiwi,u must be hungry
11-07-2020T00:12:26,Ordithus,that's my secret
11-07-2020T00:12:36,Ordithus,I'm always hungry :ctwokinds-maevecute:
11-07-2020T00:13:04,SpazztasticKiwi,should I call you always or mr hungry
11-07-2020T00:13:19,SpazztasticKiwi,or ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

11-07-2020T00:13:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Toms got fancy long hair
11-07-2020T00:14:04,AspiringNoodle,"As the months go on, I might start letting my hair grow out"
11-07-2020T00:14:32,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m pretty sure his is longer than Loki’s at this point
11-07-2020T00:23:48,johnnytho,Grapes looking JUICY

11-07-2020T11:36:23,TheSexyBeast,I remember waking up that early to throw my paper route when I was younger.

11-07-2020T12:03:32,AspiringNoodle,"On an interesting note, apparently his brain scan served as the template for a lot of AI in the future"
11-07-2020T12:03:43,AspiringNoodle,"He was one of 4 ""legacy"" scans that serve the foundation of the field"

11-07-2020T14:54:48,Ordithus,kiwi have you tried using a browser instead of the app?
11-07-2020T14:55:20,SpazztasticKiwi,when I tried that last night patreon logged me out

11-07-2020T14:57:49,SpazztasticKiwi,the post literally won’t show
11-07-2020T14:58:03,Dadrobit,1GB is actually staggering to me. Looking through some of my projects and it legit takes literal hours of audio alongside several minutes of video to match... One photoshop image...
11-07-2020T14:58:49,SpazztasticKiwi,"when I followed the link there was no picture, nothing was clickable, & when I tried opening the comments it closed me out of the app"
11-07-2020T14:58:53,Twokinds,Well I don't know why that would be. What do you want to suggest? I'll just pit it in there
11-07-2020T15:00:46,SpazztasticKiwi,I was thinking about Mike running away from your pen screaming to be left alone

11-07-2020T15:21:24,Rainelover,Does a Pikehaulbe count?
11-07-2020T15:21:29,Roughlandin,It's more of a tinfoil captain's hat. For when I need to pitch crazy ships

11-07-2020T15:35:28,VinzArts,Kraken or Bacardi usually
11-07-2020T15:35:51,TheSexyBeast,No Captain Morgan!
11-07-2020T15:35:53,Ordithus,bourbon or brandy <3
11-07-2020T15:35:54,Roughlandin,I picked up an 18 year rum called Kirk and Sweeney at the start of the lockdown. Best rum I've ever had and it only cost like 39 bucks
11-07-2020T15:36:03,ThingsAreMoving,If offered I'd even take dodgy moonshine
11-07-2020T15:36:13,ThingsAreMoving,free is my favorite flavor
11-07-2020T15:36:26,Rainelover,"My dad literally has an entire corner of the living room dedicated to his alcohol, however, he is not an alcoholic, he just likes to collect it"
11-07-2020T15:36:28,Roughlandin,Mmm. Apple Pie Shine. Sneaky stuff
11-07-2020T15:37:08,Roughlandin,Tastes like apples and cinnamon and horrible hangovers
11-07-2020T15:37:13,Glassan,Kirk and Sweeney is a solid rum. Pretty good for drinking straight.
11-07-2020T15:37:15,VinzArts,Negative on Tequila though...bad things *shudder*
11-07-2020T15:37:15,ThingsAreMoving,"Plum Slivovitza, now that's some hard stuff."
11-07-2020T15:37:23,ThingsAreMoving,80% vol. plum distillate
11-07-2020T15:37:46,CrRAR,"Tequila gets a bad rap, it's just the good tequila is not cheap"
11-07-2020T15:37:49,Roughlandin,@Glassan Oh yeah. Definitely not a mixer. I've got a big bottle of Bacardi for that.
11-07-2020T15:37:55,Glassan,In my experience: Tequila = white boi stupid juice
11-07-2020T15:38:01,CrRAR,lol
11-07-2020T15:38:13,ThingsAreMoving,tequila is nice in moderation
11-07-2020T15:38:18,TheSexyBeast,I've never had a bad tequila experience
11-07-2020T15:38:33,VinzArts,I don't recall much but I'd like to forget the rest
11-07-2020T15:38:40,Rainelover,"God, I feel like I’m surrounded by my dad whenever he talks to his friends and family about his hobby"
11-07-2020T15:38:40,Roughlandin,I prefer mezcal. Tequila's hipster cousin
11-07-2020T15:38:46,CrRAR,"maybe it's just that it really smooth, it's basically fermented cactus juice"
11-07-2020T15:38:52,johnnytho,Whats the fratboi staple? Whiteclaw?
11-07-2020T15:38:58,VinzArts,Must of been real cheap stuff.
11-07-2020T15:39:01,Roughlandin,"That'd be it, johnny"
11-07-2020T15:39:05,Glassan,Whiteclaw is depression in a can.
11-07-2020T15:39:11,CrRAR,lol
11-07-2020T15:39:16,Roughlandin,It's literally watered down grain liqour
11-07-2020T15:39:19,johnnytho,lmao
11-07-2020T15:39:30,ProsePro7,No absinthe?
11-07-2020T15:39:30,VinzArts,lol
11-07-2020T15:39:31,CrRAR,*pitiful bubble floats to surface*
11-07-2020T15:39:38,TheSexyBeast,PRINT THAT ON A SHIRT!
11-07-2020T15:39:44,VinzArts,Absinthe is great!
11-07-2020T15:39:59,Roughlandin,Jaeger. Absinthe fratboi brother
11-07-2020T15:40:09,Glassan,"I never got to try real absinthe, just the fakey watered down stuff the states authorize."
11-07-2020T15:40:10,ThingsAreMoving,I don't like the taste of absinthe tbh
11-07-2020T15:40:20,VinzArts,Gotta have the real stuff though with worm wood
11-07-2020T15:40:34,ProsePro7,I dont drink but got some family that used to run the Moonshine up in the hills
11-07-2020T15:40:46,ThingsAreMoving,Much more prefer jaeger with redbull
11-07-2020T15:40:59,Ordithus,:ptv-grossedout:
11-07-2020T15:41:00,Roughlandin,Tastes like black licorice. Which I love but I understand why a lot of people don't like
11-07-2020T15:41:06,AspiringNoodle,...I has can of mike's harder mango :ptv-uneasy:
11-07-2020T15:41:09,Glassan,Never enjoyed jaegerbombs.
11-07-2020T15:41:22,Ordithus,"had one once, worst thing ever"
11-07-2020T15:41:29,TheSexyBeast,Apple Pie shine and vanilla ice cream shake
11-07-2020T15:41:30,Roughlandin,It's an aquired taste
11-07-2020T15:41:36,ProsePro7,Jaegerbombs sounds like a WWII airplane
11-07-2020T15:41:36,Glassan,"Dislike the taste of jaeger, hate red bull. Mixing the two is a recipe for disaster."
11-07-2020T15:41:49,Roughlandin,Beast knows where it's at. Apple Pie for life
11-07-2020T15:41:51,Glassan,"Beast, that sounds soooo dangerous. :P"
11-07-2020T15:42:06,Glassan,Sounds like diabetes
11-07-2020T15:42:07,VinzArts,Itz the jaeger bomb!
11-07-2020T15:42:12,Rainelover,Apparently the stream chat has turned into hobby hour for alcohol tasting
11-07-2020T15:42:12,Roughlandin,Apple Pie is by it's very nature dangerous
11-07-2020T15:42:13,ThingsAreMoving,"Apple pie shine, is that like fireball whiskey mixed with apple juice?"
11-07-2020T15:42:15,TheSexyBeast,Living on the edge...
11-07-2020T15:42:25,CrRAR,:notes:
11-07-2020T15:42:25,johnnytho,I love black licorice
11-07-2020T15:42:27,Glassan,"Not really, things"
11-07-2020T15:42:31,johnnytho,so much
11-07-2020T15:42:43,ThingsAreMoving,How'd you describe it? I'm curious
11-07-2020T15:42:50,Glassan,Apple pie shine hits different. Much harder than Fireball ever could
11-07-2020T15:42:57,johnnytho,me?
11-07-2020T15:43:02,ThingsAreMoving,What about the taste though
11-07-2020T15:43:08,TheSexyBeast,"My mom loves licorice, I am not a fan"
11-07-2020T15:43:15,ProsePro7,Moonshine mixed with apple pie imagine apple schnapps with Moon shine and cinnamon
11-07-2020T15:43:17,Glassan,It does legit taste like a spiced apple pie.
11-07-2020T15:43:21,AspiringNoodle,"Things, bruh xD"
11-07-2020T15:43:30,AspiringNoodle,Try fireball shots in angry orchard
11-07-2020T15:43:30,ThingsAreMoving,o/ Noodle
11-07-2020T15:43:33,Glassan,With a bit of bite at the end.
11-07-2020T15:43:34,Roughlandin,Like cinnamon apple juice with attached blackout
11-07-2020T15:43:35,AspiringNoodle,~
11-07-2020T15:43:45,VinzArts,Red licorice  =good
11-07-2020T15:44:02,ThingsAreMoving,I'm googling so hard right now.
11-07-2020T15:44:06,Rainelover,I can’t really participate in this conversation since I hate the taste of alcohol
11-07-2020T15:44:07,ProsePro7,For a good dry apple drink try organic apple juice with a shot of apple cider vinegar
11-07-2020T15:44:12,CrRAR,Well just dissolve a twizzler in whatever you wnat
11-07-2020T15:44:27,Glassan,"TBH, I really prefer beer, and some wines."
11-07-2020T15:44:33,CrRAR,most Alcohol: Where the flavors are made up and the taste doesn't matter
11-07-2020T15:44:34,AspiringNoodle,"Lol, Raine"
11-07-2020T15:44:35,Roughlandin,Apple Pie is a Kentucky right of passage
11-07-2020T15:44:38,Glassan,It really is for the different flavors.
11-07-2020T15:44:44,AspiringNoodle,The best stuff you can't taste the alcohol :P
11-07-2020T15:44:48,Glassan,Yes.
11-07-2020T15:44:49,CrRAR,^

11-07-2020T15:45:01,Roughlandin,Why is the tea always gone?
11-07-2020T15:45:03,ThingsAreMoving,:ctwokinds-nataniAAAAshake: Make moar!
11-07-2020T15:45:05,ProsePro7,If you cant light it on fire then its not a real drink
11-07-2020T15:45:11,VinzArts,Yep
11-07-2020T15:45:11,Glassan,"Or the alcohol is like a spice, a subtle underflavor that accents the overall drink."

11-07-2020T15:45:21,CrRAR,here you go dearie

11-07-2020T15:45:56,Roughlandin,It isn't... but it is

11-07-2020T15:45:58,VinzArts,Irish coffee for me

11-07-2020T15:46:36,ThingsAreMoving,"Tom, ya still alive?"
11-07-2020T15:46:45,Glassan,None of that Folgers garbage.
11-07-2020T15:46:50,Roughlandin,He's compiling. Hopefully also eating
11-07-2020T15:46:52,Rainelover,Ireland must be united

11-07-2020T15:47:23,VinzArts,Hello Keef
11-07-2020T15:47:46,TheSexyBeast,No Maxwell House either
11-07-2020T15:48:19,Glassan,Best Irish Coffee I ever made was after I came back from a work trip in El Salvador. I got a bunch of fresh coffee straight from the smaller farms down there...
11-07-2020T15:48:23,VinzArts,Only the good stuff Gevalia or other
11-07-2020T15:48:25,CrRAR,home grown beans

11-07-2020T15:48:38,Roughlandin,Anybody tried Black Rifle coffee? Honestly some of the best coffee I've had
11-07-2020T15:48:55,TheSexyBeast,I need to
11-07-2020T15:48:58,Roughlandin,I don't even have to put cream or sugar in it
11-07-2020T15:49:05,KeefMcDerpface,:ptv-shock: Coffee made from Black Rifles?!
11-07-2020T15:49:10,Glassan,"Then I made it the classic way; two shots of Irish whiskey, a pinch of brown sugar to alter the density, and heavy whipping cream poured over the back of a spoon."
11-07-2020T15:49:14,VinzArts,I like the sound of it
11-07-2020T15:49:17,Roughlandin,It's super good
11-07-2020T15:49:18,Glassan,Black Rifle makes some pretty baller coffee.
11-07-2020T15:49:42,Roughlandin,They have a super black roast called Murdered Out. That one's my fave
11-07-2020T15:49:42,CrRAR,Roasted by being shot out of a cannon:tm:
11-07-2020T15:49:45,Glassan,"Of course, I came from a military background as well, so I'm certainly biased. >_>"
11-07-2020T15:49:50,ThingsAreMoving,I have a subscription based coffee beans delivery. Opening a new bag of freshly roasted ones is almost as good as the cup I make out of them.
11-07-2020T15:50:02,CrRAR,Peets is good stuff
11-07-2020T15:50:09,CrRAR,Mellower than Sbucks
11-07-2020T15:50:29,CrRAR,Which imo is a bit too overdone flavorwise
11-07-2020T15:50:36,VinzArts,I need this coffee of the rifle
11-07-2020T15:50:46,Roughlandin,BRCC look it up

11-07-2020T15:51:02,Glassan,BRCC's AK47 is pretty much my standard morning coffee.

11-07-2020T15:52:02,Glassan,Most 'Murica thing.
11-07-2020T15:52:05,KeefMcDerpface,How do you make a prius less shit? By adding a minigun to it.
11-07-2020T15:52:06,ThingsAreMoving,Lemme see...
11-07-2020T15:52:17,Roughlandin,lol
11-07-2020T15:52:17,CrRAR,Cafe Domingo is good and tasty too.

11-07-2020T15:53:03,ThingsAreMoving,"Nope, the only one from Costa Rica they have available is Amapola Tarrazu"
11-07-2020T15:53:05,Glassan,"El Salvador, Guatamala and Belize make some of my favorite coffee. Especially when they only do a very light roast."
11-07-2020T15:53:07,CrRAR,nice
11-07-2020T15:53:11,Rainelover,A Prius with a minigun is the most violently American thing I’ve ever heard of
11-07-2020T15:53:14,Glassan,That stuff is soooo smoth and sweet.
11-07-2020T15:53:18,Roughlandin,My bro just got the new Toyota RAV 4 hybrid. It's pretty sweet and waaaay less ugly than a Prius
11-07-2020T15:53:19,K3IDRAN,You eat at Mickey D's I stick with Taco bell
11-07-2020T15:53:45,ThingsAreMoving,"Got a name of that coffe, Ord?"
11-07-2020T15:53:49,CrRAR,"Yeah, that's my problem with sbuchs roasts, too bold despite even ""medium"" roasts everything tastes burnt"
11-07-2020T15:53:55,Ordithus,Duluth Coffee Company

11-07-2020T15:54:54,CrRAR,Their coffees make good bases for coffee drinks
11-07-2020T15:54:54,Roughlandin,I should have guessed
11-07-2020T15:55:06,VinzArts,Ironic if they make both coffee and underwear
11-07-2020T15:55:16,Roughlandin,They DO make some dang comfy underwear tho
11-07-2020T15:55:19,KeefMcDerpface,"We make underwear, coffee, and underwear made from coffee."
11-07-2020T15:55:21,CrRAR,They use the underwear to STRAIN the coffee!
11-07-2020T15:55:28,VinzArts,lol

11-07-2020T15:55:44,Rainelover,The only thing that could be more American is if you drove through the McDonalds drive-thru in an M1A1 Abrams with American flags flying on the back of it
11-07-2020T15:55:55,CrRAR,ABRAMS!!!
11-07-2020T15:55:55,ThingsAreMoving,"There's three different coffees from Peru available from that company, Ord. Which one do you recommend?"

11-07-2020T15:57:18,ThingsAreMoving,lol
11-07-2020T15:57:25,VinzArts,Never been in an armored vehicle...does a Huey gunship count for anything lol
11-07-2020T15:57:26,ProsePro7,Its a tank with a crane
11-07-2020T15:57:30,Rainelover,I personally think we need to ditch the Abrams and make a new tank
11-07-2020T15:57:30,Glassan,At least it didn't flip itself over and try to kill you.
11-07-2020T15:57:35,ThingsAreMoving,"No worries. If you ever find out, let me know."
11-07-2020T15:57:36,Roughlandin,Oh sitting was fine. Getting out was less so
11-07-2020T15:57:40,ProsePro7,Agreed new tank
11-07-2020T15:57:59,VinzArts,Stealth Tank
11-07-2020T15:58:00,Glassan,The new M1A3 freebrams is honestly pretty good.
11-07-2020T15:58:12,Rainelover,Making variants of the same tank can only go so far
11-07-2020T15:58:20,KeefMcDerpface,yeah
11-07-2020T15:58:26,Roughlandin,Yeah I think the A3 is also slated to stay in service till like... 2050 or something? So...
11-07-2020T15:58:38,VinzArts,Abrams is what 40 years old now?
11-07-2020T15:58:45,Glassan,"Well, the A3 Abrams is the newest variant."
11-07-2020T15:58:45,CrRAR,classiq
11-07-2020T15:58:52,Roughlandin,Adopted in the 70s yeah
11-07-2020T15:59:07,KeefMcDerpface,Hovertank Abrams?! :ptv-excited:
11-07-2020T15:59:08,Glassan,Those are slated to go to the heavies in the next couple years.
11-07-2020T15:59:20,Roughlandin,Well 1980. Tested in the 70s
11-07-2020T15:59:22,VinzArts,Most of our stuff is from around then tbh
11-07-2020T15:59:41,Glassan,"That was the last time we did a major, ground-up redesign."
11-07-2020T15:59:50,Rainelover,"Meanwhile, Germany is going to faze out the Leopard II in favor of the New Leopard III by 2030"
11-07-2020T15:59:58,VinzArts,With the exception of the newer planes and missiles ect
11-07-2020T16:00:16,Roughlandin,Basically. We still use the B52 and it's supposed to stay in service till it's over 100 years old
11-07-2020T16:00:23,Glassan,"I think they're putting more priority in US DOD to replace the bradley, given the general issues with it."
11-07-2020T16:00:23,TheSexyBeast,B-52?
11-07-2020T16:00:37,VinzArts,Their retiring the other two bombers
11-07-2020T16:00:49,Roughlandin,The B-52 Stratofortress
11-07-2020T16:00:51,KeefMcDerpface,^
11-07-2020T16:00:56,Xexanoth,it's more like: german yis gonna stop selling leopard 2 and start selling leopard 3s...cause that's pretty much the only thing we're doing with our tanks
11-07-2020T16:00:58,VinzArts,B-2 and B-1 both ment to replace it lol
11-07-2020T16:01:07,ProsePro7,The warthog has been around for a while too but its not the main weapon of choice we do have the F22 I still say we need an update
11-07-2020T16:01:22,TheSexyBeast,Loved the B2
11-07-2020T16:01:29,VinzArts,Raptor is impressive in person
11-07-2020T16:01:31,Glassan,The A-10 is a true skybeast.
11-07-2020T16:01:35,KeefMcDerpface,yep
11-07-2020T16:01:44,Glassan,evry1 luv da BRRRT
11-07-2020T16:01:45,ProsePro7,Burrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
11-07-2020T16:01:51,Roughlandin,The successor to the B2 is supposed to be introduced in the next few years or so
11-07-2020T16:01:54,KeefMcDerpface,Had two A-10s fly over my house once. A sight unlike any other.
11-07-2020T16:02:06,Rainelover,"Isn’t the stratofortress from like, the mid 50’s?"
11-07-2020T16:02:10,ProsePro7,It is a gun with wings on it...Merica!
11-07-2020T16:02:17,KeefMcDerpface,lol
11-07-2020T16:02:19,KeefMcDerpface,yep
11-07-2020T16:02:25,Glassan,"Yes, Prose. That is entirely correct."
11-07-2020T16:02:27,VinzArts,Got the chance to sit in the A-10 that was cool
11-07-2020T16:02:35,KeefMcDerpface,And then we put said gun on a tank if I recall.
11-07-2020T16:02:49,Roughlandin,Yep. B-52 came out in the 50s. And is staying in service till the 2050s
11-07-2020T16:03:08,Rainelover,Personally I think we should bring back the battleships
11-07-2020T16:03:12,Roughlandin,Lol
11-07-2020T16:03:15,KeefMcDerpface,hehe
11-07-2020T16:03:20,VinzArts,Wager the B-52 and A-10 outlast everything else
11-07-2020T16:03:23,Rainelover,Modernized of course
11-07-2020T16:03:39,KeefMcDerpface,"Yes, the Battleship Tanager."
11-07-2020T16:03:41,johnnytho,BRRRT posting I see
11-07-2020T16:03:44,Roughlandin,Missile tech has basically made battleships obsolete
11-07-2020T16:03:48,Glassan,B-52 for the Air Force is like the M1 Garand and the M1911 for ground pounders.
11-07-2020T16:03:56,TheSexyBeast,Stealth battleships
11-07-2020T16:03:57,SpazztasticKiwi,how late exactly are we
11-07-2020T16:04:06,Glassan,Not at all.
11-07-2020T16:04:12,VinzArts,I'd like to bring Zeppelins back
11-07-2020T16:04:17,Roughlandin,Well it's 5 now. Probably gonna start soon
11-07-2020T16:04:20,Glassan,WAR ZEPPELINS!
11-07-2020T16:04:25,ThingsAreMoving,Soon™
11-07-2020T16:04:30,ProsePro7,We need to build a tank around a gun like the Germans did in WW2 with the Panzer VI and Tiger tank
11-07-2020T16:04:41,ProsePro7,88mm cannon
11-07-2020T16:04:55,Roughlandin,Didn't they kinda do that with the Abrams?
11-07-2020T16:05:03,Glassan,That's exactly what they did.
11-07-2020T16:05:05,ProsePro7,Sorta
11-07-2020T16:05:17,ProsePro7,Just do it again
11-07-2020T16:05:31,Roughlandin,I'm sure the turret crew feels like it. I don't think I could even fit in an Abrams turret
11-07-2020T16:05:33,Glassan,"and for an MBT, there isn't a lot of value to anything over 105-120mm"
11-07-2020T16:05:38,VinzArts,One of those guys behind the Stuka helped with the A-10 design so there's that lol
11-07-2020T16:06:03,Glassan,One of the guys I knew from work lost a finger last year in the Abrams loading door.
11-07-2020T16:06:09,Glassan,Those things are crazy heavy.
11-07-2020T16:06:13,KeefMcDerpface,ouch
11-07-2020T16:06:22,ProsePro7,After WW2 Germans hand one choice build stuff or go on trial....guess which one they picked
11-07-2020T16:06:29,VinzArts,:ptv-shock:
11-07-2020T16:06:30,Roughlandin,"Not an uncommon problem from what I undertand, Glassan"
11-07-2020T16:06:47,Glassan,It isn't. Happens distressingly often.
11-07-2020T16:06:56,ThingsAreMoving,Just operate a tank with full body armor
11-07-2020T16:07:04,Glassan,Just as much to the gunner than the loader.
11-07-2020T16:07:04,ThingsAreMoving,Be a Knight tank operator
11-07-2020T16:07:42,VinzArts,Think they'll go the Terminator route with tanks?
11-07-2020T16:07:45,Glassan,"That would be funny, if it weren't horrifyiing."
11-07-2020T16:07:58,KeefMcDerpface,Hovertanks?
11-07-2020T16:08:08,TheSexyBeast,Railguns
11-07-2020T16:08:14,KeefMcDerpface,Lasers.
11-07-2020T16:08:23,Arteg489,Will there be a stream today?
11-07-2020T16:08:23,Roughlandin,Austrian robots?
11-07-2020T16:08:30,Glassan,Railguns will probably be saved for Artillery anyway.
11-07-2020T16:08:32,johnnytho,yea
11-07-2020T16:08:35,Ordithus,"planning on one, yes"
11-07-2020T16:08:36,Roughlandin,"Stream will start shortly, Arteg"
11-07-2020T16:08:41,TheSexyBeast,On their heads!!!
11-07-2020T16:08:42,Roughlandin,Hopefully lol
11-07-2020T16:08:42,johnnytho,Toms working on the comic atm
11-07-2020T16:08:46,Ordithus,after pages are done!
11-07-2020T16:09:19,ProsePro7,"Meanwhile we are talking about Tanks, Airplanes, Alcohol and Coffee...oh my"
11-07-2020T16:09:25,Rainelover,"Fuck no, war zeppelins are far too outdated, there is a reason that they where abandoned as a weapon after The Great War, meanwhile, the Missouri, a ww2 era battleship, wasn’t decommissioned for the last time until 1992"
11-07-2020T16:09:27,Roughlandin,Only the best things
11-07-2020T16:09:32,johnnytho,Manly stream
11-07-2020T16:09:42,Glassan,"I had another friend that worked at the NTC at Fort Irwin, who showed me a video of the M777 Paladin driving down a hill direct-firing on another tank. That was hilarious."
11-07-2020T16:09:50,Roughlandin,Kittens and puppies are also nice
11-07-2020T16:09:50,ProsePro7,Yes Rain when do we get the mighty Airships that modern war deserves
11-07-2020T16:10:00,Glassan,Even arty can be a direct fire weapon if you're brave enough. xD
11-07-2020T16:10:16,TheSexyBeast,Railguns ON battleships!!
11-07-2020T16:10:24,Roughlandin,Card games on motorcycles!
11-07-2020T16:10:28,Glassan,Now THAT is close to being a thing.
11-07-2020T16:10:31,ProsePro7,Rods from God
11-07-2020T16:10:31,Rainelover,400 mm guns!
11-07-2020T16:10:44,Glassan,Big Bertha reborn.
11-07-2020T16:10:47,VinzArts,Laser Zeppelin
11-07-2020T16:10:51,ProsePro7,Kinetic energy rounds from space
11-07-2020T16:10:54,KeefMcDerpface,Lasers on planes? :ptv-excited:
11-07-2020T16:10:59,Rainelover,Bring back the Montana class!
11-07-2020T16:11:16,KeefMcDerpface,ADF-01 Morgan when?
11-07-2020T16:11:26,Roughlandin,They've got lasers on destroyers already. Just recently tested one that set a drone on fire
11-07-2020T16:11:58,VinzArts,I'm sure they have lasers on them already we just don't know about it
11-07-2020T16:12:42,ThingsAreMoving,"All your methods of destruction are nice and all, but where are my promised hoverboards and Mr. Fusion machine, eh?"
11-07-2020T16:12:46,TheSexyBeast,Battleship Yamato is real?!?
11-07-2020T16:12:50,VinzArts,If they were able to get them tiny to fit on the Raptor or something
11-07-2020T16:13:18,ProsePro7,@TheSexyBeast Yes it was real the Axis was obsessed with size
11-07-2020T16:13:33,Rainelover,H44 was ridiculously big
11-07-2020T16:13:37,VinzArts,Flying DeLorean plz
11-07-2020T16:13:41,Roughlandin,BMW made a hoverboard a few years ago
11-07-2020T16:13:54,TheSexyBeast,STAR BLAZERS!!!
11-07-2020T16:13:58,Roughlandin,"Lexus, sorry"
11-07-2020T16:14:07,Rainelover,Space battleship!
11-07-2020T16:14:59,VinzArts,Star Destroyers :ptv-excited:
11-07-2020T16:15:17,ProsePro7,Coming soon Space Force!
11-07-2020T16:15:38,Rainelover,It’s already here!
11-07-2020T16:15:54,TheSexyBeast,Space...the final frontier
11-07-2020T16:15:57,ProsePro7,Eh yes and no
11-07-2020T16:16:10,ProsePro7,Still cant join it like the other branches but we will get there
11-07-2020T16:16:14,VinzArts,I've signed up for space cadet training
11-07-2020T16:16:20,KeefMcDerpface,We're still waiting for our city sized ships.
11-07-2020T16:16:26,Rainelover,It’s an official branch of the military now!
11-07-2020T16:16:42,ProsePro7,Yeah its just hard to join
11-07-2020T16:16:57,Rainelover,Space Bismarck!
11-07-2020T16:17:10,TheSexyBeast,City sized ships? Like on the Boston album covers?
11-07-2020T16:17:12,Glassan,I still love how having the Space Force now is more of a bureaucratic workaround to budget issues than anything else.
11-07-2020T16:17:27,ProsePro7,"USS Armstrong, Galaxy class destroyer"
11-07-2020T16:17:34,KeefMcDerpface,lol
11-07-2020T16:17:35,VinzArts,Probably going to be a red shirt :cry:
11-07-2020T16:17:42,KeefMcDerpface,I can see that happening.
11-07-2020T16:17:46,Glassan,Because the Airforce and other branches kept taking money from space stuff for other things.
11-07-2020T16:18:20,ProsePro7,"It will take time but it will work out, the Airforce got kicked around for years"
11-07-2020T16:18:20,Rainelover,The RAN space Australia!
11-07-2020T16:18:48,Glassan,Beware the red men from SPACE AUSTRALIA!
11-07-2020T16:18:49,KeefMcDerpface,Does this mean we'll have a base on the moon?
11-07-2020T16:18:58,ProsePro7,Hopefully
11-07-2020T16:19:12,TheSexyBeast,GO SPACE BRONCOS!
11-07-2020T16:19:19,Roughlandin,Finally. Time to mine all that delicious moon cheese! Hehehe
11-07-2020T16:19:19,VinzArts,There was already an Air Force Space Command they basically renamed lol
11-07-2020T16:19:59,Glassan,That's exactly what it was. SPACECOM being under AF meant they were subject to AF budgets.
11-07-2020T16:20:18,Roughlandin,I wanna go to the moon. Become a moon whaler. Futurama told me there's good business in it
11-07-2020T16:20:24,Glassan,"Now that they are their own branch, they have their own budget."
11-07-2020T16:20:39,VinzArts,I'm going to have to relocate my evil space lair
11-07-2020T16:20:48,ProsePro7,Will you carry a harpoon?
11-07-2020T16:20:49,Glassan,WE'RE WHALERS ON THE MOON. WE CARRY A HARPOON!
11-07-2020T16:20:55,Rainelover,Kinda like how the Air Force was subject to Navy and army budgets before it became its own branch
11-07-2020T16:21:04,ProsePro7,Bingo
11-07-2020T16:21:48,Glassan,AF was only subject to Army budget. Navy always ran their own aircraft once carriers became a thing.
11-07-2020T16:22:18,Rainelover,"No, the navy had its own aircraft too"
11-07-2020T16:22:45,KeefMcDerpface,Land based I assume?
11-07-2020T16:22:52,Roughlandin,Brb gonna grab a sippy
11-07-2020T16:22:57,KeefMcDerpface,bye
11-07-2020T16:22:58,Glassan,"I still love how in the Americas, the top 5 largest airforces are 1. USAF 2. USN 3. US Army 4. Brazilian AF 5. USMC"
11-07-2020T16:23:41,Rainelover,"...did you just ask if NAVY aircraft were land based? Not trying to be rude, just asking"
11-07-2020T16:23:54,VinzArts,Our DoD budget is double China and Russia $$
11-07-2020T16:24:02,IronHorseComics,"didn't think the Brazilian one would be that big, I would have thought Canada would be *somewhat* respectable"
11-07-2020T16:24:31,ProsePro7,The military budget is still only 19% of the annual budget
11-07-2020T16:25:03,Rainelover,"The Deutches Heer is a sad, underfunded shell of its former self"
11-07-2020T16:25:59,Rainelover,Germany wouldn’t even be able to defend itself against POLAND if it came to that
11-07-2020T16:26:26,VinzArts,Still got those nifty Eurofigthers though
11-07-2020T16:26:27,Glassan,Now I wanna go back to War Thunder and use all the American stuff to enjoy what a runaway defense budget can do.
11-07-2020T16:26:34,TheSexyBeast,Did I hear right that two more carrier fleets are headed to Taiwan?
11-07-2020T16:26:40,ThingsAreMoving,Doubtful. Poland has antiquated military tech
11-07-2020T16:26:58,Rainelover,Yet it has a bigger military
11-07-2020T16:27:25,Glassan,"Size is just one factor, though."
11-07-2020T16:27:46,ThingsAreMoving,"I thought since compulsory military service has been lifted, the actual amount of soldiers dwindled"
11-07-2020T16:27:55,TheSexyBeast,"Winged Hussars, with laser pointers"
11-07-2020T16:27:55,VinzArts,If size were the case China would likely be #1
11-07-2020T16:28:17,Rainelover,"Then again, they have to deal with deterring attack from Russia and it’s allies"
11-07-2020T16:28:49,Glassan,Chinese history pretty much ensures that they don't have many (if any) allies militarily in a conflict.
11-07-2020T16:28:49,Rainelover,Germany does not
11-07-2020T16:29:12,ThingsAreMoving,Most of Polish military strength is defending within it's own borders.
11-07-2020T16:29:25,ThingsAreMoving,In case of an invasion
11-07-2020T16:30:12,Katfeathers,:ckatfeathers-KatLoafEM:
11-07-2020T16:30:13,Glassan,"Honestly, I think with the maintenance of NATO, Germany and NATO overall would be better served if they invested more in support and infrastructure than direct defense."
11-07-2020T16:30:25,Glassan,But that's a political argument not well suited for here.
11-07-2020T16:30:32,Rainelover,Chinese history also pretty much ensures that china can never be united as one country for more than a few centuries at most at a time
11-07-2020T16:31:26,Glassan,That's still technically better than the US. :V
11-07-2020T16:31:44,Glassan,Didn't even make it 100 years before we tried to split ourselves.
11-07-2020T16:31:51,ProsePro7,To much politics back to big guns!
11-07-2020T16:32:04,ThingsAreMoving,I wonder how much time will it take to unite people on earth under one banner.
11-07-2020T16:32:05,ShamusTheFox,"How's it going, fellow fellows?"
11-07-2020T16:32:13,Glassan,"Yo, Shamus"
11-07-2020T16:32:21,ThingsAreMoving,o/ Shamus. Waiting for the strem
11-07-2020T16:32:23,ProsePro7,@ThingsAreMoving an alien invasion\
11-07-2020T16:32:30,KeefMcDerpface,hello Shamus
11-07-2020T16:32:43,Glassan,Prose be right. Outside context.
11-07-2020T16:32:46,VinzArts,Hello Shamus!
11-07-2020T16:32:47,Rainelover,"Well the United States only tried to do that once, then again, it seems like we are trying to do it a second time here lately"
11-07-2020T16:32:59,Avolendi,"Pretty much doubt it requires time, but rather a common enemy or something equally big to put things in perspective"

11-07-2020T16:33:09,Glassan,Now THAT is less history and more politics.
11-07-2020T16:33:14,ShamusTheFox,I missed last week's stream because of virtual Anthrocon. No such conflict today.
11-07-2020T16:33:47,ShamusTheFox,"Which was cool, by the way."
11-07-2020T16:33:50,TheSexyBeast,Isn't Covid a common enemy?
11-07-2020T16:33:55,ThingsAreMoving,I missed last three streams due to work. I'm starved for some of those good vibes.
11-07-2020T16:34:06,VinzArts,Geo-politics this week
11-07-2020T16:34:58,Glassan,Last two weeks been lucky with work for me. Two 4-day weekends in a row. \o/

11-07-2020T16:36:12,Rainelover,It’s kinda sad that we have to have an outside threat present at all times to NOT try to tear each other apart
11-07-2020T16:36:19,ShamusTheFox,And I'm 43 now. Yay.
11-07-2020T16:36:25,ThingsAreMoving,I have 3 week holiday coming end of august. I hope I will be able to visit my country without that whole quarantine stuff.

11-07-2020T17:16:36,Combak,No stream?
11-07-2020T17:16:39,VinzArts,I'm like 95% Irish...

11-07-2020T17:59:36,ShamusTheFox,"Rock. Well, I am going to take this time to take a hot shower to soothe my back. And then I will see what's shaking."
11-07-2020T17:59:43,ProsePro7,@Twokinds Tom did want to warn you about Pateon canceling anime style art recenty  wanted to give you a warning in case they target ya
11-07-2020T17:59:53,VinzArts,Understandable
11-07-2020T18:00:07,Ordithus,yeah iliar runs it
11-07-2020T18:00:40,AspiringNoodle,"Aaaah, a true man of culture"
11-07-2020T18:00:44,AspiringNoodle,"I've also mentioned this, Prose :)"
11-07-2020T18:01:04,AspiringNoodle,"Honestly, if patreon dies, it effing deserves it -_-"
11-07-2020T18:01:20,VinzArts,Wait their targeting accounts :ptv-shock:
11-07-2020T18:01:22,ThingsAreMoving,"So, the strem starts in an hour then? I might get a nice long shower before that."
11-07-2020T18:01:28,ProsePro7,I worry Tom is especially in danger because they say its due to under aged characters and most Keidran are like 10
11-07-2020T18:01:32,AspiringNoodle,"Not accounts, but content in general"
11-07-2020T18:01:35,TheSexyBeast,"Patreon, Tumblr, ..."
11-07-2020T18:01:49,AspiringNoodle,Patreon doesn't like anime / manga style art because the characters appear too young
11-07-2020T18:02:01,VinzArts,Hmm perhaps I should hold off starting my own then...
11-07-2020T18:02:15,ProsePro7,There is always subscribe star
11-07-2020T18:02:24,AspiringNoodle,"At some point, Patreon will realize that what they *thought* were cutting off wasn't useless bits, but instead entire limbs..."
11-07-2020T18:02:50,KeefMcDerpface,:ptv-shock: Not the limbs!
11-07-2020T18:02:53,AspiringNoodle,"But at that point, the cash loss will be too great"

11-07-2020T18:03:55,CrRAR,but then how can one be fancy without a pinkie?
11-07-2020T18:04:00,ProsePro7,As long as no one forces anything on anyone do what ya want.
11-07-2020T18:04:06,AspiringNoodle,"Yeah, no"
11-07-2020T18:04:07,ProsePro7,What does it matter
11-07-2020T18:04:12,AspiringNoodle,Patreon is now policing off-site behavior / content
11-07-2020T18:04:37,AspiringNoodle,"If you make content that violates their rules, but it's not on their platform, and you don't even link to it in any way on patreon"
11-07-2020T18:04:50,AspiringNoodle,"They'll be like, ""Oh, we see you got some naughty stuff over here, better get rid of it or we'll shut you down."""
11-07-2020T18:05:11,AspiringNoodle,Because it's NEVER enough

11-07-2020T18:05:49,ProsePro7,You do you I'll do me and we wont do each other...probably
11-07-2020T18:05:52,BadFoMo,Sounds like they're going out of their 'jurisdiction'.
11-07-2020T18:05:53,AspiringNoodle,"Doesn't have to be illegal.  If they don't want it on their platform, they don't want you making / posting it ANYWHERE"
11-07-2020T18:06:12,TheSexyBeast,"Like warfare, blood, and chopped off limbs?"
11-07-2020T18:06:21,AspiringNoodle,"That's okay, I think"
11-07-2020T18:06:25,VinzArts,Naughty likely anything I've made in the past few weeks
11-07-2020T18:07:02,Katfeathers,Still no Tom eh
11-07-2020T18:07:04,AspiringNoodle,"But yeah, more and more artists are having their patreon's suspended for review"

11-07-2020T18:08:45,AspiringNoodle,Fluff is okay by their terms

11-07-2020T18:09:00,VinzArts,I'm not liking the whole were going to remove your art because it shows adult themes
11-07-2020T18:09:01,AspiringNoodle,Is the more niche / hardcore stuff
11-07-2020T18:09:12,KeefMcDerpface,Oh that stuff?
11-07-2020T18:09:14,AspiringNoodle,"Not illegal, but not allowed anywhere because they don't approve of it, lol"
11-07-2020T18:09:24,WINDOWS98SE,Didn't Tom get his Patreon suspended for a while like a year ago?
11-07-2020T18:09:33,Ordithus,patreon is at the behest of the credit card companies
11-07-2020T18:09:39,CrRAR,"yeah, just about everyone did"

11-07-2020T18:27:05,Ordithus,Tom just has to start painting everything now :ctwokinds-keith8D:
11-07-2020T18:27:16,unsteddyphoenix,"Its like ""happy cute time is OVER"""
11-07-2020T18:27:19,unsteddyphoenix,lmao yeah
11-07-2020T18:27:30,WINDOWS98SE,I think I get the detritus reference...
11-07-2020T18:27:37,Mediawatcher,Maren is here! Rose is just holy! Another bombshell! Now things are gonna get intense as hell!
11-07-2020T18:27:37,WINDOWS98SE,All those rose petals...
11-07-2020T18:27:42,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I am not prepared for non happy cute times
11-07-2020T18:27:50,Mediawatcher,Well we finally found out where Maren is
11-07-2020T18:27:51,WINDOWS98SE,She wants Trace to get out the leaf blower.
11-07-2020T18:28:00,CrimsonHelsing,"Wait, ""Detritus,"" she said it again! What is that, a password? Her way of granting access to restricted areas, and opening doors that otherwise would never open for anyone?"
11-07-2020T18:28:13,ShamusTheFox,It means trash
11-07-2020T18:28:17,AspiringNoodle,^
11-07-2020T18:28:20,ThingsAreMoving,^
11-07-2020T18:28:28,VinzArts,lol Leaf blower Trace
11-07-2020T18:28:32,AspiringNoodle,"Or rubble, debris found in an area"
11-07-2020T18:28:32,CrRAR,Detritus is her name for Stoney I think
11-07-2020T18:28:47,johnnytho,I dont think so
11-07-2020T18:28:53,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Calling best boy trash?  How dare she
11-07-2020T18:28:59,ProsePro7,It means waste or debris
11-07-2020T18:29:03,CrimsonHelsing,"Hahaha, I know the meaning of the word xP I'm talking about why she said that."
11-07-2020T18:29:05,johnnytho,^
11-07-2020T18:29:06,ThingsAreMoving,"""Detritus... Trace..."" suggests she's calling Trace - Trash"
11-07-2020T18:29:14,unsteddyphoenix,haha
11-07-2020T18:29:15,ThingsAreMoving,"Not surprising, tbh"
11-07-2020T18:29:24,CrRAR,lol
11-07-2020T18:29:25,KeefMcDerpface,:ptv-laugh:
11-07-2020T18:29:27,RimaDraws,its latin
11-07-2020T18:29:29,johnnytho,I think shes calling herself that
11-07-2020T18:29:31,Ordithus,suspect there is more to it than that
11-07-2020T18:29:35,RimaDraws,for deterioration
11-07-2020T18:29:46,Twokinds,I'm going to quickly grab some food and start the stream
11-07-2020T18:29:49,unsteddyphoenix,although she couldjust be roasting him
11-07-2020T18:29:51,ThingsAreMoving,okies
11-07-2020T18:29:53,Ordithus,eat something tasty Tom
11-07-2020T18:29:54,ShamusTheFox,Woot!

11-07-2020T18:30:00,InTheLionsDen,Good plan
11-07-2020T18:30:01,ProsePro7,Filth I think is more like it.  And dont forget the rose glass above her broke so I think she is about to go full Hal 9000
11-07-2020T18:30:05,unsteddyphoenix,cool streams still gona happen
11-07-2020T18:30:16,ThingsAreMoving,"Roasting Trace is one thing she'll never tire of, I'm sure of it."

11-07-2020T18:31:00,NotNuhteneye,evening
11-07-2020T18:31:01,Mediawatcher,"Damn tom another bombshell, we are just on a rollercoaster!"
11-07-2020T18:31:02,CrRAR,a great mystery
11-07-2020T18:31:07,AspiringNoodle,"Well, I was half-right about what happened"
11-07-2020T18:31:08,CrRAR,like in Citizen Kane xD
11-07-2020T18:31:09,ShamusTheFox,"""Constable Detritus DON'T SALUTE!"""
11-07-2020T18:31:12,Mediawatcher,"Well we found maren, now trace needs to save her"
11-07-2020T18:31:22,Ordithus,Trace needs to save Rose
11-07-2020T18:31:32,ProsePro7,I still wonder if Sythe is somewhere in here
11-07-2020T18:31:34,Mediawatcher,He needs to free jer
11-07-2020T18:31:36,Mediawatcher,Her
11-07-2020T18:31:45,SerifGFont,Their is no salvation.
11-07-2020T18:31:46,Mediawatcher,"So we know where maren is, where’s sythe?"
11-07-2020T18:31:47,AspiringNoodle,Threw out the possibility that Trace figured out how to revive the dead and did it to Rose
11-07-2020T18:31:48,VinzArts,This can't end well...
11-07-2020T18:32:02,AspiringNoodle,Extending life is pretty durn close <3
11-07-2020T18:32:03,Mediawatcher,Someone’s gonna die!
11-07-2020T18:32:03,Ordithus,Sythe is probably running around frantically
11-07-2020T18:32:11,CrRAR,haha
11-07-2020T18:32:12,Xexanoth,"yeah, he didn't get teleportet after all"
11-07-2020T18:32:24,AspiringNoodle,"""Where is my human waifu?!?"""
11-07-2020T18:32:28,ProsePro7,We dont know that?
11-07-2020T18:32:29,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Sythe ""I never been rejected this hard before!! ;-; """
11-07-2020T18:32:33,ProsePro7,Do we?
11-07-2020T18:32:36,Mediawatcher,Lol!
11-07-2020T18:32:40,AspiringNoodle,Ha
11-07-2020T18:32:40,Ordithus,marv ha
11-07-2020T18:32:43,ShamusTheFox,So here's a question: Did Trace experiment on Rose against her will? Or did she volunteer?
11-07-2020T18:32:47,CrRAR,Sythe: good at making potential girlfriends disappear
11-07-2020T18:32:53,AspiringNoodle,Rejected so hard that the magic house nopes your target away
11-07-2020T18:32:55,Mediawatcher,Pretty obviously the former
11-07-2020T18:32:57,ProsePro7,She called him filth so...
11-07-2020T18:33:04,ThingsAreMoving,"I'd bet the former, Shamus"
11-07-2020T18:33:10,unsteddyphoenix,no honestly it could be either
11-07-2020T18:33:18,AspiringNoodle,^
11-07-2020T18:33:19,unsteddyphoenix,She loved Saria after all
11-07-2020T18:33:22,VinzArts,Weren't there multiple voice during the Maren teleport scene?...have so many questions
11-07-2020T18:33:25,Mediawatcher,Tom has no chill!
11-07-2020T18:33:31,ShamusTheFox,I don't know. For the chance of getting Saria back...
11-07-2020T18:33:37,AspiringNoodle,It's possible there are unforeseen side effects from what Trace did
11-07-2020T18:33:37,VinzArts,*voices
11-07-2020T18:33:40,Mediawatcher,Save maren trace! Fix what you’ve done!
11-07-2020T18:33:44,johnnytho,She would let Saria go
11-07-2020T18:33:55,ProsePro7,Most likely Trace was making deals with dark spirits to revive Saria and that is what the spirits are
11-07-2020T18:33:57,AspiringNoodle,And Rose has come to hate him for it
11-07-2020T18:34:06,Ordithus,"Perhaps, I'm not entirely sure Rose is really herself right now"
11-07-2020T18:34:09,CrRAR,well whatever is attacking the rest of the group may be part of another entity maybe?
11-07-2020T18:34:25,InTheLionsDen,Now that he has released Rose from restrictions Rose can transfer to Maren's body.
11-07-2020T18:34:27,AspiringNoodle,That is also true.  This be dark magic.  Blobby void magic make mind to coocoo
11-07-2020T18:34:57,Ordithus,"Rose AND Saria in Maren's body?  Man, all my waifus packed in one"
11-07-2020T18:35:08,unsteddyphoenix,hahaha
11-07-2020T18:35:13,KeefMcDerpface,lol
11-07-2020T18:35:18,unsteddyphoenix,the ultamite waifu
11-07-2020T18:35:24,ThingsAreMoving,Waifu.zip
11-07-2020T18:35:25,Mediawatcher,Dammit ord not the time! 😂
11-07-2020T18:35:26,johnnytho,Oh Ord
11-07-2020T18:35:26,AspiringNoodle,That said...
11-07-2020T18:35:27,Ordithus,Seriously they're like my top 3 haha
11-07-2020T18:35:41,AspiringNoodle,We're not sure if Rose died and was brought back to life or if Trace extended it
11-07-2020T18:35:56,ProsePro7,Someone get the water bottle and spray down Ord
11-07-2020T18:35:57,ThingsAreMoving,"Suspended animation, looks like"
11-07-2020T18:35:58,ShamusTheFox,"My top three are Laura, Nora, and Adira."
11-07-2020T18:36:18,VinzArts,Maybe there are two Roses?
11-07-2020T18:36:32,InTheLionsDen,Why stop at two
11-07-2020T18:36:42,AspiringNoodle,I think the Rose we've been seeing is like a mental projection throughout the house
11-07-2020T18:36:55,AspiringNoodle,"But thanks to magic, she's also capable of physical interactions"
11-07-2020T18:37:23,SerifGFont,Got to love Necromancy the magic that alters the coarse of life (always has unexpected consequences)
11-07-2020T18:37:32,VinzArts,True it could be manifestations of all her different moods or something like that
11-07-2020T18:38:04,AspiringNoodle,"In the coming pages, we'll find out if that placard on the painting represents the year she died, or the year she *should* have died"
11-07-2020T18:38:30,AspiringNoodle,Stay tuned to find out next time on TwoKinds!
11-07-2020T18:38:39,ShamusTheFox,Rose seemed like she was warming to Trace. I wonder if her personality was altered.
11-07-2020T18:38:52,Glassan,Does make me wonder about that joke about getting more eggs from trespassers-turned-chickens. How many folks were trapped in those dungeons before the faux-templar attack came along?
11-07-2020T18:39:01,ProsePro7,Dammit Tom one day this is going to be animated if I have to take out a mortgage
11-07-2020T18:39:04,AspiringNoodle,Who knows
11-07-2020T18:39:15,AspiringNoodle,Pre-amnesia Trace was the dick to end all dicks.
11-07-2020T18:39:15,unsteddyphoenix,has rose actually touched anyone? :thinking:
11-07-2020T18:39:16,Katfeathers,"From what she said on todays page it sounds lik ""should have"""
11-07-2020T18:39:25,Ordithus,Her interactions with our crew may have changed the course here
11-07-2020T18:39:35,ThingsAreMoving,She touched Raine when she handed her the collar I think
11-07-2020T18:39:53,AspiringNoodle,"Well Kat, that's what we find out, lol"
11-07-2020T18:40:05,AspiringNoodle,She did say that he was researching both ways to restore and extend life :P
11-07-2020T18:40:15,AspiringNoodle,Don't know which one he did yet
11-07-2020T18:40:23,FloofyCat,Is the stream confirmed cancelled or anything?

11-07-2020T18:45:03,AspiringNoodle,I really need to work on how much other food I eat

11-07-2020T20:01:13,ThingsAreMoving,Just... more
11-07-2020T20:01:32,VinzArts,RoboCop needs the gore that's kind of what made it so endearing that and Peter Wellers performance

11-07-2020T20:01:37,PalmettoPathfinder1,@ThingsAreMoving I heard that a lot of British fans of Judge Dredd were furious when Dredd took off his helmet in the movie with Stallone.
11-07-2020T20:02:09,ThingsAreMoving,That's possible tbh
11-07-2020T20:02:30,ProsePro7,The most recent Dredd was awesome it was like a love letter to 80's movies

11-07-2020T23:12:31,ProsePro7,Yeah I almost missed a few
11-07-2020T23:12:37,ThingsAreMoving,moving to other financing platform would be troublesome on it's own I'd wager. Especially that tkpolls is using patreon's login socket for voting
11-07-2020T23:12:39,KiTA,Maybe a screen flash or what have you
11-07-2020T23:12:58,CrRAR,"buying a ""coffee"" though is actually just a tip of $3 I think. It's just explained that way for some reason"

11-07-2020T23:20:59,BadFoMo,I have 12:20 AM.
11-07-2020T23:21:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I thought of a mega cute suggestion that I wish there was a guaranteed commission tier to get
11-07-2020T23:21:09,BlackjackSec99,^
11-07-2020T23:21:17,BlackjackSec99,I know of this idea
11-07-2020T23:21:21,BlackjackSec99,needs happen
11-07-2020T23:21:34,SpazztasticKiwi,both of them need to be done
11-07-2020T23:21:41,BlackjackSec99,weaponized cuteness
11-07-2020T23:21:43,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve had a Maeve streak lately
11-07-2020T23:21:59,Roughlandin,"Anybody know how my Brutey and the Boss suggestion went? Not well, I take it lol"
11-07-2020T23:22:48,BlackjackSec99,"which one, the cage one?"
11-07-2020T23:22:53,Roughlandin,Yus
11-07-2020T23:22:59,BadFoMo,It came in at 19th place.
11-07-2020T23:23:03,SpazztasticKiwi,yeah I’ve come across a conundrum too
11-07-2020T23:23:04,BlackjackSec99,...well you werent last...
11-07-2020T23:23:07,Roughlandin,Awright! Not last!
11-07-2020T23:23:24,SpazztasticKiwi,"if I try the vote link, I can’t log in"
11-07-2020T23:23:39,SpazztasticKiwi,safari can’t open the webpage
11-07-2020T23:23:39,Roughlandin,Probably because the poll isn't up anymore
11-07-2020T23:23:50,SpazztasticKiwi,I mean mid stream obviously
11-07-2020T23:23:58,Roughlandin,Weird
11-07-2020T23:24:08,SpazztasticKiwi,"but if I go to tk polls, I can add to a ballot like I’m voting"
11-07-2020T23:24:11,Roughlandin,Try a different browser next time?
11-07-2020T23:24:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I have no way of knowing if this works
11-07-2020T23:24:31,Roughlandin,I use Firefox and never have any issues
11-07-2020T23:24:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"safari is the iphone browser...like, the only one"
11-07-2020T23:25:07,CrRAR,"you can get chrome, right?"
11-07-2020T23:25:08,SpazztasticKiwi,but I also can’t really tell how my suggestion does most often than not
11-07-2020T23:25:17,Roughlandin,Yeah doesn't IOS have a Chrome app?
11-07-2020T23:25:19,SpazztasticKiwi,"again, I’m on iphone"
11-07-2020T23:25:37,CrRAR,the results page? ord linked it earlier
11-07-2020T23:25:51,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’d like to get a sort of tablet, maybe one to draw but I don’t doodle enough to get an ipad though that’s the one I’d prefer"

11-07-2020T23:26:54,SpazztasticKiwi,"and I technically have a tablet that I could use to draw, my 6/7 year old kindle, but like the draw app I have on my phone, it’s not...eh"
11-07-2020T23:28:38,Roughlandin,Well hopefully I can make next week's stream. My brother's still in town so I'm being WAY more social than I'm used to lol
11-07-2020T23:28:59,SpazztasticKiwi,"and for the person that’s so thirsty for mike & Evals sister, I just wanna talk"
11-07-2020T23:29:16,Roughlandin,"Woah, what'd I miss?"
11-07-2020T23:30:32,Roughlandin,"Don't get me wrong, I'm as thirst for both Mike AND Erilas as anybody else, but... How thirsty we talking about?"
11-07-2020T23:32:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I mean I got an idea they might like but the interest is....somebody need to talk to a professional
11-07-2020T23:32:55,Roughlandin,Well every fandom has that segment
11-07-2020T23:33:24,SpazztasticKiwi,"I swear I’m not leaving ses out on purpose to sound more caveman, fingers are just going too fast for the keyboard to catch apparently"
11-07-2020T23:34:13,Roughlandin,I am also guilty of this. I mostly blame it on my giant stubby bear fingers
11-07-2020T23:34:45,KeefMcDerpface,I like to do things slow but with how fast chat gets... yeah.
11-07-2020T23:34:54,SpazztasticKiwi,I can’t see how Tom is still sane with this poll thing
11-07-2020T23:35:22,SpazztasticKiwi,how’d the Mike running from the art pen do?
11-07-2020T23:35:34,Roughlandin,I don't see how he makes sense of some of them lol. There was one a month or two ago that was like... what did that person even want?
11-07-2020T23:35:54,KeefMcDerpface,"Oh yeah, that one."
11-07-2020T23:35:57,SpazztasticKiwi,to watch Tom burn
11-07-2020T23:36:07,Roughlandin,"The suggest was like ""Draw the actress reacting to the scenes"""
11-07-2020T23:36:11,Roughlandin,Like... that was it
11-07-2020T23:36:19,KeefMcDerpface,Oh... that one.
11-07-2020T23:37:01,Roughlandin,"I mean it's fine. But it's no ""Draw Trace eating pretzels."""
11-07-2020T23:37:16,KeefMcDerpface,We still need a pretzel emote...
11-07-2020T23:37:42,Roughlandin,Someone should write Picarto. It's criminal really
11-07-2020T23:37:56,SpazztasticKiwi,🥨🥨🥨
11-07-2020T23:38:08,BadFoMo,@SpazztasticKiwi it came in the 18th place in round 2 with 1 vote.
11-07-2020T23:38:26,SpazztasticKiwi,yeaaaaah can’t say I didn’t expect that
11-07-2020T23:38:28,Roughlandin,Woohoo! Me and spazz in the No Love club this week
11-07-2020T23:38:30,BadFoMo,*It
11-07-2020T23:39:02,Roughlandin,Idk how my other suggest did last week either. The sequel to Intern Flora and CEO Trace one
11-07-2020T23:40:22,SpazztasticKiwi,"should’ve polled for “cute, fun, or ‘go sit in the corner’”"
11-07-2020T23:40:41,Roughlandin,Found it! No votes! Alright!
11-07-2020T23:40:43,SpazztasticKiwi,those are normally what my ideas circle around
11-07-2020T23:42:19,BadFoMo,"@Roughlandin I've found that when TKPoll says '0 votes', it /may/ have goten a few votes. ...It's a little janky like that."
11-07-2020T23:42:45,Roughlandin,Oh yeah. It only counts people who had it at the top of their list
11-07-2020T23:43:20,Roughlandin,So when it says 0 votes. It means mine didn't top anyone's list. It probably got onto at least one. Just not the top
11-07-2020T23:43:44,Roughlandin,Meh. That's how the poll rolls! *Shrugs.*
11-07-2020T23:43:56,Roughlandin,I won last month anyway so I can't complain lol
11-07-2020T23:44:11,SpazztasticKiwi,you know what
11-07-2020T23:44:16,Roughlandin,Wat?
11-07-2020T23:44:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I want more Colin sketches
11-07-2020T23:44:28,Roughlandin,Colin is a fine boy
11-07-2020T23:44:40,Roughlandin,More sketches of Colin would be nice
11-07-2020T23:44:47,KeefMcDerpface,agree
11-07-2020T23:44:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Fine 🥇
11-07-2020T23:45:13,Roughlandin,Speaking of. Somebody needs to ask Tom to post those Sam and Colin sketches he did on a Friday stream a few weeks back. Those were super cute
11-07-2020T23:47:08,KeefMcDerpface,So is it more Keidran Colin? Human Colin? Or both?
11-07-2020T23:47:52,SpazztasticKiwi,yes
11-07-2020T23:48:22,SpazztasticKiwi,human Colin might be more my taste but that could be residue from liking Daniels
11-07-2020T23:57:55,Roughlandin,Well I'm probably gonna hit the hay. Hope I can actually catch the stream next week! Night all!
11-07-2020T23:58:06,Roughlandin,o/
11-07-2020T23:58:09,KeefMcDerpface,bye Rough
11-07-2020T23:59:49,SpazztasticKiwi,have we had a nat & maren swap yet
