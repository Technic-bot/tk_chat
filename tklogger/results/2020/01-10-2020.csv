01-10-2020T14:16:37,AspiringNoodle,Great... work about to get worse... again...
01-10-2020T14:17:47,CrimsonQuill,Uh oh
01-10-2020T14:22:25,AspiringNoodle,BARS changed the rules.  We have to card anyone who appears under 50 while wearing a mask for tobacco purchases
01-10-2020T14:28:45,CrimsonQuill,How does that work?
01-10-2020T14:30:40,AspiringNoodle,"If you look at them, and they look like they aren't 50, card them"
01-10-2020T14:31:01,CrimsonQuill,"As in, pay by card? Age card?"
01-10-2020T14:31:07,AspiringNoodle,ID
01-10-2020T14:31:28,CrimsonQuill,I see
01-10-2020T14:31:33,AspiringNoodle,"And ofc, if they don't have valid, unexpired ID on them, we can't sell them tobacco."
01-10-2020T14:32:26,CrimsonQuill,That's hurting business?
01-10-2020T14:36:05,AspiringNoodle,Well... definitely gonna lead to more pissed off customers.
01-10-2020T14:36:33,CrimsonQuill,"...which, by extension, leads to tough times for you..."
01-10-2020T14:37:04,AspiringNoodle,"Good news though, apparently we officially have a new hire."
01-10-2020T14:37:22,CrimsonQuill,I fear for their soul
01-10-2020T14:40:13,AspiringNoodle,"Well, we're already well into the ""they might be here awhile"" sifter"
01-10-2020T14:41:00,AspiringNoodle,"Most people are weeded out in the initial stages.  Be it they fail the background check, lack access to a computer (because some paperwork is emailed, and ONLY emailed)"
01-10-2020T14:41:22,AspiringNoodle,Or they just never show up for the interview.
01-10-2020T14:41:34,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,Lol
01-10-2020T14:42:00,AspiringNoodle,"So if they make it past the 2 week mark, the next milestone will be 3 months (for which we give no raise)"
01-10-2020T15:17:18,CrRAR,"Welp, somebody punched Rick Moranis."

01-10-2020T15:51:40,AspiringNoodle,Either that or in a mental institution...

01-10-2020T20:18:36,CrRAR,"How long is the recovery expected to take, sage?"
01-10-2020T20:19:00,SageSaga,its complicated
01-10-2020T20:19:37,SageSaga,the surgery is to prevent my body from destroying itself- it still needs to heal naturally - which can take months
01-10-2020T20:19:58,SageSaga,but the major pain SHOULD go down and practically disappear much sooner
01-10-2020T20:20:26,Ordithus,ello!

01-10-2020T20:21:04,SageSaga,"day of surgery i practically had no pain (DRUGS), day 2 i felt better (STILL DRUGGED) day 3 I felt bad but not terrible- Day 4- I feel horrible- the pain is intense"
01-10-2020T20:21:41,CrimsonHelsing,Damn that's a heck of a downward slope ene;
01-10-2020T20:22:12,Ordithus,Yay drugs! Sorry you're in pain. Hope you feel better soon.
01-10-2020T20:22:14,SageSaga,i think i pushed myself too soon which probably caused this
01-10-2020T20:22:28,Nekonny,:(
01-10-2020T20:22:40,SageSaga,im hoping the nausea is caused by the pain
01-10-2020T20:26:08,SageSaga,no fever though so- hopefully thats a good sign its not an infection
01-10-2020T20:26:58,RimaDraws,i hope not
01-10-2020T20:28:00,SageSaga,you hope not? o_o
