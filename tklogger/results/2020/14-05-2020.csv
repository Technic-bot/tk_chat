14-05-2020T12:52:57,TerraTheWizard,because old english is more of a mess than now english
14-05-2020T15:10:10,CrimsonQuill,Good evening...
14-05-2020T15:10:17,CrimsonQuill,blargs
14-05-2020T15:10:43,CrimsonQuill,"Exam is over. I'm having an early night tonight. I just wanted to pop in, say hello."
14-05-2020T15:10:53,CrimsonQuill,All I can do is wait.
14-05-2020T15:12:18,JojoGD,hello
14-05-2020T15:12:35,CrimsonQuill,Hullo
14-05-2020T15:19:07,CrimsonQuill,And I want to draw two Daleks in a hallway
14-05-2020T15:19:21,CrimsonQuill,Sudden urges are weird
14-05-2020T15:19:23,CrimsonQuill,...
14-05-2020T15:26:16,AspiringNoodle,QUILL
14-05-2020T15:26:21,AspiringNoodle,I HAS SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO TELLS YOU
14-05-2020T15:26:48,CrimsonQuill,"Oh, hi Noodle"
14-05-2020T15:26:54,CrimsonQuill,How are you?
14-05-2020T15:29:36,AspiringNoodle,"Good. Also, hi c:"
14-05-2020T15:29:49,AspiringNoodle,Btw. I wanted to let you know
14-05-2020T15:29:50,CrimsonQuill,Just finished my exam today
14-05-2020T15:29:53,CrimsonQuill,Oh?
14-05-2020T15:30:06,AspiringNoodle,"Before you try taking on Gundyr again, download the Watchdog mod for DS3"
14-05-2020T15:30:18,CrimsonQuill,Watchdog mod? What does that do?
14-05-2020T15:30:35,AspiringNoodle,It's a way to detect / prevent / kick hackers during your sessions
14-05-2020T15:30:55,CrimsonQuill,Ooooh
14-05-2020T15:31:06,CrimsonQuill,"Good idea then, I'll download it when I try it"
14-05-2020T15:31:19,AspiringNoodle,"DS3 USED to have Family Share, which was a workaround for Fromsoft's lazy anti-cheat / customer service"
14-05-2020T15:31:20,CrimsonQuill,Might try it Sunday or Monday
14-05-2020T15:31:40,AspiringNoodle,"Though, since they removed family share, they're willing to unban people more than once"
14-05-2020T15:31:55,CrimsonQuill,oof
14-05-2020T15:31:55,AspiringNoodle,But this just lets you avoid the annoyance and headaches and potentially needing to delete characters
14-05-2020T15:32:06,CrimsonQuill,That's good :)
14-05-2020T15:32:14,AspiringNoodle,That last bit is the big one
14-05-2020T15:32:40,AspiringNoodle,"Script kiddies can inject your character with invalid gestures / items that can't be removed through normal means, and those things can set off the anti-cheat and softban you"
14-05-2020T15:33:34,CrimsonQuill,Oh
14-05-2020T15:33:34,AspiringNoodle,"That said, watched a funny vid where a script kiddie tried injecting a BUNCH of invalid items to a guy, and then trying to kill him with a ""cursed"" straight sword, and then being SUPER confused when nothing happened :ptv-laugh:"
14-05-2020T15:33:36,CrimsonQuill,Oh Shoot
14-05-2020T15:33:54,AspiringNoodle,"Honestly, it's funny"
14-05-2020T15:33:59,CrimsonQuill,aheheheh
14-05-2020T15:34:05,AspiringNoodle,All they have to do is take the Watchdog mod and bake it into the game
14-05-2020T15:34:19,AspiringNoodle,"And boom, their shitty cheating problem is basically null and void"
14-05-2020T15:34:28,CrimsonQuill,Nice-=thanks
14-05-2020T15:34:47,AspiringNoodle,"Btw, I found the most ""I don't care"" hacker ever"
14-05-2020T15:35:02,AspiringNoodle,"Watchdog was like ""WARNING, REAL SL DOES NOT MATCH GAME'S DETECTED SL"""
14-05-2020T15:35:17,CrimsonQuill,What's SL?
14-05-2020T15:35:22,AspiringNoodle,Soul Level
14-05-2020T15:35:27,CrimsonQuill,Ah
14-05-2020T15:35:53,AspiringNoodle,"Guy was listed as 34, but his ""real"" level was 35 :ptv-snicker:"
14-05-2020T15:35:53,CrimsonQuill,L;OL
14-05-2020T15:36:40,AspiringNoodle,"I'm like, ""*GASP* I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS ATROCITY! HE SHALL PAY FOR THIS! *presses ignore hotkey to turn off warning*"" :ptv-laugh:"
14-05-2020T15:36:50,CrimsonQuill,XD

14-05-2020T15:36:59,CrimsonQuill,NEED TOILET

14-05-2020T15:37:11,AspiringNoodle,I am in sewer at moment

14-05-2020T15:51:38,CrimsonQuill,tired
14-05-2020T15:51:55,CrimsonQuill,Tomorrow is Halo Reach Legendary binge day
14-05-2020T15:55:37,AspiringNoodle,That was annoying
14-05-2020T15:56:03,AspiringNoodle,"Got killed by an invader because the host was such an effing coward that they ran back to the bonfire to summon more phantoms, instead of killing the damned NPC that was giving me trouble"
14-05-2020T15:56:15,AspiringNoodle,Would have won if that NPC was dead
14-05-2020T15:59:41,CrimsonQuill,OOF
14-05-2020T16:02:27,CrimsonQuill,That is just ridiculous
14-05-2020T16:05:44,CrimsonQuill,It's a pity really
14-05-2020T16:05:56,CrimsonQuill,How close were you?
14-05-2020T16:13:51,AspiringNoodle,The other guy was 1 hit away from death before a fire column knocked me up and let them make some space to heal
14-05-2020T16:14:43,AspiringNoodle,"Seriously, this game is probably the FRIENDLIEST game in the series for players.  Dying isn't that big of a deal, embers are handed out left and right like candy"
14-05-2020T16:14:53,AspiringNoodle,"If you're going to be that much of a coward, just play offline!!!"
14-05-2020T16:16:22,K3IDRAN,Hola

14-05-2020T21:36:12,SageSaga,3 if you count that guy who wanted his dragon man in my comic impregnating all the girls- i dont count that though
14-05-2020T21:36:18,Dadrobit,I feel like writing your own fanfic is... Kinda defeating the whole point?
14-05-2020T21:36:18,w0lfmare,They usually consist of someone coming and saving Ember from her aweful predicament
14-05-2020T21:36:29,CrRAR,wow

14-05-2020T22:12:38,ShamusTheFox,"""I don't want to go on the cart!"""
14-05-2020T22:12:39,AspiringNoodle,I swear... the past 2 weeks I've been crashing around 11 pm like clockwork
14-05-2020T22:12:53,Ordithus,:ptv-wondering:
14-05-2020T22:13:01,Mihari,Michelle is not a character of mine.
14-05-2020T22:13:10,ZRO4825,Fun note: Mihari is also in Yosh! but not quite the same. :o
14-05-2020T22:13:13,Nekonny,Mihari INC
14-05-2020T22:13:15,NezumiYuki,Oh speaking of Natani... Is that our favorite BIG Woof with that chicken boine in the mouth over there?  xD
14-05-2020T22:13:36,ZRO4825,"Well, yeah, bad wording. Not YOUR character, but influenced by you, yes?"
14-05-2020T22:13:38,NezumiYuki,bone*
14-05-2020T22:13:40,BeeMill,Thanks. Like I said I'm not super versed in the furry community. I know some basic stuff but I'm not familiar with many significant members of the community
14-05-2020T22:13:48,Mihari,Loosely based off of.
14-05-2020T22:13:55,KeefMcDerpface,Passing off the chicken bone like a Cuban cigar.
14-05-2020T22:14:19,ShamusTheFox,The goggles! They do nothing!
14-05-2020T22:14:37,Ordithus,"knowing Sage's habits, who is the real nyna"
14-05-2020T22:14:45,ZRO4825,"I remember Sage mentioned it a few times, my brain just holds on to details like a soaped up cat sometimes is all."
14-05-2020T22:15:06,Mihari,I think all but one character is 100% fictional in origin XD
14-05-2020T22:15:11,BeeMill,"So if I may, what makes Mihari a known member of the furry community? No offsene, I'm just oblivious haha"
14-05-2020T22:15:13,ShamusTheFox,I always thought it was neat that the characters in Solatorobo spoke French.
14-05-2020T22:15:24,Ordithus,katbox
14-05-2020T22:15:24,SageSaga,that's not true
14-05-2020T22:15:49,SageSaga,many yosh characters are losely based on real people
14-05-2020T22:15:57,Mihari,I was talking about AI
14-05-2020T22:15:59,unsteddyphoenix,She has nice breasts
14-05-2020T22:16:03,NezumiYuki,"Well yes, apart from ""Predators""   Speed Kitty Mihari was for a time the Admit of Catbox... if IRC"
14-05-2020T22:16:14,NezumiYuki,Admin*
14-05-2020T22:16:18,MarvTheHugPharaoh,No u do teddy
14-05-2020T22:16:19,IronHorseComics,she's still the katbox logo
14-05-2020T22:16:24,Mihari,No I'm not.
14-05-2020T22:16:28,SageSaga,ah yeah- i think none of AIs are
14-05-2020T22:16:28,ShamusTheFox,Red Natani is shaping up nice.
14-05-2020T22:16:36,Mihari,Space Captain Mike! :D
14-05-2020T22:16:42,BluePhantom90,what is this?
14-05-2020T22:16:53,SageSaga,Space Captain Mike is sorta i guess XD
14-05-2020T22:17:00,Mihari,Why I said 1 XD
14-05-2020T22:17:04,IronHorseComics,Natani in a WW1 fighter pilot getup?
14-05-2020T22:17:09,BluePhantom90,Ah
14-05-2020T22:17:17,Ordithus,"When I see Mike's do, I can only think Tunnel Snakes Rule"
14-05-2020T22:17:28,ShamusTheFox,"Natani as Red Savarin, I believe."
14-05-2020T22:17:28,IronHorseComics,"I'm just making a guess bub, no need to take it at face value"
14-05-2020T22:17:43,SageSaga,i know some people might think Kevin is based off of me because I used one of my own life experiences for his story- but nope
14-05-2020T22:17:44,BlazingFoxSpirit,Natani as Red Savarin from Solatorobo
14-05-2020T22:17:49,Mihari,"@BeeMill I have no idea how Mihari became so popular, dumb luck? XD"
14-05-2020T22:17:53,K3IDRAN,Leave  Butch In the vault
14-05-2020T22:18:28,ShamusTheFox,Sometimes the fates align!
14-05-2020T22:18:44,BeeMill,"@Mihari well you certainly seem like a nice person, and it sounds like you're decently active in the community so that always helps too :p"
14-05-2020T22:19:04,Mihari,Maybe? XD
14-05-2020T22:19:08,NezumiYuki,"maybe we can all blame Fluffy Kevlar for Mi-chan becoming so popular all of a sudden.  Because to be frank... I found out about Mi-chan mostly through that ""comic""   sorry Mihari but those are facts.  xD"
14-05-2020T22:19:21,ZRO4825,"Mihari is definitely a nice person, so long as you're not being an idiot. ^_^"
14-05-2020T22:19:34,Mihari,"Yah, Predators did net me a lot more ... what's the word..."
14-05-2020T22:19:40,Mihari,Infamy?
14-05-2020T22:19:44,ZRO4825,Admirers?
14-05-2020T22:19:44,ShamusTheFox,Attention?
14-05-2020T22:19:53,BLADEDGE,bribes?
14-05-2020T22:19:56,IronHorseComics,thirsty people?
14-05-2020T22:19:56,Davoerlo,Scorp would help too. Plenty of pics from him
14-05-2020T22:19:56,NezumiYuki,"yeah we'll roll with infamy, Mihari.  xDD"
14-05-2020T22:20:05,BeeMill,I mean honestly that's how I've networked my way to the top of multiple small online communities. I was just real personable and offered my help wherever possible
14-05-2020T22:20:17,SageSaga,infamy is not correct because most people dont view that comic as bad
14-05-2020T22:20:23,Ordithus,:eyes: such a dashing wolf
14-05-2020T22:20:27,Mihari,But I do? XD
14-05-2020T22:20:39,ZRO4825,I certainly don't. But I also know Mihari and just saw it as a bonus dealie.
14-05-2020T22:20:45,SageSaga,but you arent seen by others as bad due to it
14-05-2020T22:21:11,ZRO4825,Then again I seem to be one of the few people that sees OOC stuff as just that...OOC. Non-canon. Porn on the side? Who cares? It's not canon!
14-05-2020T22:21:35,BeeMill,So was the comic just sort of fanfare? Definitely doesn't sound like it was comissioned
14-05-2020T22:21:43,SageSaga,hmm what's the opposite of infamy? because famous is neutral
14-05-2020T22:21:49,HoverdudeXL,ohh
14-05-2020T22:21:51,Mihari,"Well, Mihari has no canon, so.... XD"
14-05-2020T22:21:57,ShamusTheFox,Accolades?
14-05-2020T22:21:59,NezumiYuki,"But generally that's how it goes ZRO...  ""Its on the net, therefore it must be canon!"""
14-05-2020T22:21:59,BeeMill,Notoriety?
14-05-2020T22:22:02,w0lfmare,"The character Mihari doesn't really have a ""canon"" though, right?"
14-05-2020T22:22:03,Ordithus,but does she have a cannon?
14-05-2020T22:22:03,ZRO4825,Sure she does. The canon is how you consider her in your head.
14-05-2020T22:22:17,ZRO4825,Mihari's canon is how Mihari sees Mihari in Mihari's head.
14-05-2020T22:22:28,Ordithus,miharception
14-05-2020T22:22:29,Mihari,She's a online avatar of myself XD
14-05-2020T22:22:31,Mihari,So...
14-05-2020T22:22:32,ShamusTheFox,That's a lot of Mihari
14-05-2020T22:22:35,NezumiYuki,Will agree with @BeeMill.... Notoriety
14-05-2020T22:22:47,w0lfmare,"But to other people, the only reference they have is other one-off pictures"
14-05-2020T22:22:51,KeefMcDerpface,"Flora: ""Look at all the Miharis."""
14-05-2020T22:22:57,unsteddyphoenix,Infamy~
14-05-2020T22:23:17,w0lfmare,A comic character is easy to separate canon from non-canon for
14-05-2020T22:23:18,SageSaga,Notoriety is also  for an evil act
14-05-2020T22:23:33,SageSaga,reputable seems like the closest one
14-05-2020T22:23:47,BadFoMo,Evil Genius?
14-05-2020T22:23:51,SageSaga,being known for having a good reputation
14-05-2020T22:23:52,ShamusTheFox,"I think I kinda get it. It's nice to be known and recognized, but people can form ideas about who you are before even meeting you."
14-05-2020T22:23:59,BeeMill,"Eh, at this point we're fussing over one word. I think we got the point, haha"
14-05-2020T22:24:26,ZRO4825,"Well, either way, my view on it was, bonus! Cuz Mihari is still Mihari. Best cheetah lady. ^_^"
14-05-2020T22:24:30,w0lfmare,"I think Mihari using the word ""infamy"" implies unwanted reputation from her perspective?"
14-05-2020T22:24:34,SageSaga,some people here could benefit from learning more about words!
14-05-2020T22:24:50,BeeMill,"oooh, shot fired"
14-05-2020T22:24:59,Ordithus,Hey I word good
14-05-2020T22:25:07,ZRO4825,"Nah, that's just a comment. You'll know when Sage actually fires shots. :P"
14-05-2020T22:25:10,BeeMill,I word excellently
14-05-2020T22:25:17,NezumiYuki,I wurd... kinda gud... I thinkz
14-05-2020T22:25:22,ShamusTheFox,I communicate in grunts and pointing.
14-05-2020T22:25:25,SageSaga,when i fire shots- people die
14-05-2020T22:25:27,SageSaga,XD
14-05-2020T22:25:27,AspiringNoodle,"Yuki, have you been drinking? lol"
14-05-2020T22:25:33,BeeMill,Learn how to spell the longest word in english then come back to me
14-05-2020T22:25:35,AspiringNoodle,"Oh wait, we're not talking about *that* kinda shots?"
14-05-2020T22:25:37,AspiringNoodle,Nvm
14-05-2020T22:26:05,BeeMill,Take a shot then fire a shot
14-05-2020T22:26:06,KeefMcDerpface,And then everybody started blasting.
14-05-2020T22:26:13,NezumiYuki,Me?  nah... not even... I'm a total light weight... a single Miller Draft would put me in a loop!   xDD   No sips of that stuff tonight....
14-05-2020T22:26:25,Mihari,Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious?
14-05-2020T22:26:32,BeeMill,I'll do you one better
14-05-2020T22:26:41,NezumiYuki,A spoonful of sugar....
14-05-2020T22:26:53,ShamusTheFox,"By the way. If you've never played Solatorobo, it's cute. Not a deep game, but cute. Worth playing."
14-05-2020T22:26:58,Ordithus,"is way too much sugar, yeesh"
14-05-2020T22:27:09,NezumiYuki,Wait... before I nibble that plant power.. What's the medicine chasing it???
14-05-2020T22:27:13,BeeMill,Pneumonoultramicrocopicsilicavolcanoconiosis
14-05-2020T22:27:20,KeefMcDerpface,So I'm assuming Keith is the cat character.
14-05-2020T22:27:33,ShamusTheFox,That would be my guess.
14-05-2020T22:27:38,IronHorseComics,the bunny cat character
14-05-2020T22:27:49,KeefMcDerpface,:ptv-laugh:
14-05-2020T22:27:59,IronHorseComics,with bizarre ears
14-05-2020T22:28:00,ShamusTheFox,Natani walks in on Keith naked in the shower.
14-05-2020T22:28:04,BeeMill,What was the prompt on this sketch?
14-05-2020T22:28:11,KeefMcDerpface,A game.
14-05-2020T22:28:18,KeefMcDerpface,For the 3DS?
14-05-2020T22:28:27,ShamusTheFox,"Yep, 3DS."
14-05-2020T22:28:29,starcat13,"""Natani dressed in a provocative Slave Leia style outfit, angry at viewers who keep asking for suggestive sketches of her, while Keith isn't sure how to react."""
14-05-2020T22:28:41,Ordithus,uh wrong
14-05-2020T22:28:57,BeeMill,"Huh, which 3DS game?"
14-05-2020T22:29:02,BlazingFoxSpirit,Solatorobo
14-05-2020T22:29:03,ShamusTheFox,Solatorobo
14-05-2020T22:29:06,KeefMcDerpface,^
14-05-2020T22:29:11,KeefMcDerpface,Good game I hear.
14-05-2020T22:29:14,Ordithus,"""Natani dressed as Red Savarin, and Keith dressed as Elh Meliz√©e from Solatorobo"""
14-05-2020T22:29:24,BeeMill,"Oh, never heard of it. But I'm getting steampunk vibes"
14-05-2020T22:29:37,KeefMcDerpface,That's pretty much what it is.
14-05-2020T22:29:52,ShamusTheFox,"It was a simple game, but it had a really nice soundtrack and engaging story."
14-05-2020T22:29:55,IronHorseComics,"well peeps, I'm off to bed. Y'all behave now, no lewd drawings while I'm gone.... bwahahahahaaa!"
14-05-2020T22:29:57,BlazingFoxSpirit,i was a hidden gem of an OG DS game
14-05-2020T22:30:00,Ordithus,night Iron!
14-05-2020T22:30:05,w0lfmare,Night iron o/
14-05-2020T22:30:13,Ordithus,Dat Natani though

14-05-2020T22:30:14,KeefMcDerpface,bye Iron
14-05-2020T22:30:16,Ordithus,swoons

14-05-2020T22:30:55,Ordithus,I'll be a pretty girl for Natani
14-05-2020T22:31:06,w0lfmare,XD
14-05-2020T22:31:09,NezumiYuki,"How do Basitins deal with their floppy cabbit ears anyway?   I don't know about you, bit I see them as a daily nuisance.   xD"
14-05-2020T22:31:10,BeeMill,Nah I'll tell you what the gem of the DS era was: flipnote studio
14-05-2020T22:31:12,Sclimshady,Who wouldnt
14-05-2020T22:31:22,CrimsonHelsing,I forget what this suggestion was
14-05-2020T22:31:29,ShamusTheFox,"My favorite character in the game was the dog scientist that was Red's ""Mom"""
14-05-2020T22:31:57,BeeMill,Flipnote studio was my shit in middle school
14-05-2020T22:32:19,BeeMill,I wonder if y'all are old enough to have had that
14-05-2020T22:32:30,ShamusTheFox,<- 42
14-05-2020T22:32:38,BeeMill,That'll do
14-05-2020T22:32:56,BlazingFoxSpirit,<- 32
14-05-2020T22:33:05,KeefMcDerpface,Why do I got a feeling Trace is responsible for that one *plot twist* in the game.
14-05-2020T22:33:19,BeeMill,My perception of the furry community is probably dominated by late teens to early twenties people
14-05-2020T22:33:30,Ordithus,Folks of many ages here
14-05-2020T22:33:34,BeeMill,but then again I know nothing
14-05-2020T22:33:35,KeefMcDerpface,yep
14-05-2020T22:33:41,ZRO4825,"Oh, btw, Sage. Free login weekend for FFXI. :P"
14-05-2020T22:33:45,unsteddyphoenix,Idk man they've all aged now really
14-05-2020T22:33:56,unsteddyphoenix,Like that was true back in 2002 but
14-05-2020T22:33:57,johnnytho,Im college aged
14-05-2020T22:34:00,BeeMill,New ones are always joining though

14-05-2020T22:34:19,SageSaga,o_O Free login for FFXI?
14-05-2020T22:34:26,ShamusTheFox,I've had so many good memories being part of the furry community. Cons are the best.
14-05-2020T22:34:31,ZRO4825,Yus.
14-05-2020T22:34:36,BlazingFoxSpirit,indeed
14-05-2020T22:34:38,BeeMill,And I'd expect the furry thing to phase out for at least some as they move on in life
14-05-2020T22:34:42,SageSaga,why?
14-05-2020T22:35:19,ZRO4825,They do it every few months for the past couple years or so.
14-05-2020T22:35:38,SageSaga,well im busy the most on weekends XD
14-05-2020T22:35:41,Rosscoe,Good Mornings!
14-05-2020T22:35:48,KeefMcDerpface,Hello Rosscoe
14-05-2020T22:35:49,unsteddyphoenix,"True, but a decent amount remain"

14-05-2020T22:36:08,Rosscoe,Oh noice Sage! Mihari and.......drat her name is on the tip of my tounge
14-05-2020T22:36:09,Ordithus,You're so quiet when you finish things
14-05-2020T22:36:16,NezumiYuki,"Agreed, Sage, that's a cute pairing!"
14-05-2020T22:36:19,Rosscoe,"And there we go, Michelle XD"
14-05-2020T22:36:26,NezumiYuki,Love those matching bikini!
14-05-2020T22:36:48,ShamusTheFox,"The furry community just seems to get larger and larger. The old guard is still there, but it's really becoming a social thing."
14-05-2020T22:36:52,ZRO4825,"Bee, I'mma point out, I'm 37. And I know a number of furs quite older than me, lol."
14-05-2020T22:36:59,BeeMill,"Lol, like how you wrote it as ""mihari's demand"""
14-05-2020T22:37:02,SageSaga,hmm how many fridays are left
14-05-2020T22:37:08,BeeMill,Until what?
14-05-2020T22:37:09,ZRO4825,2
14-05-2020T22:37:09,Ordithus,two
14-05-2020T22:37:15,Rosscoe,Two more for this month
14-05-2020T22:37:22,BeeMill,"Oh, for Tom's streams"
14-05-2020T22:37:26,Ordithus,"then no more fridays, ever :eyes:"
14-05-2020T22:37:34,KeefMcDerpface,:ptv-shock:
14-05-2020T22:37:41,SageSaga,hmm then i might stop there and do the others then- and work on the comic now
14-05-2020T22:37:44,KeefMcDerpface,So Thursday becomes the new Friday?
14-05-2020T22:37:52,BeeMill,Fridays have been cancelled in the interest of getting over with 2020 over with as soon as possible
14-05-2020T22:38:01,unsteddyphoenix,Goddamn Keith is lookin cute
14-05-2020T22:38:08,NezumiYuki,Wait what' I'd miss?  Why the end to Friday Tom Streams?
14-05-2020T22:38:08,ShamusTheFox,Cancel Mondays instead.

14-05-2020T22:42:42,AspiringNoodle,^^^
14-05-2020T22:42:59,SageSaga,was Noodle implying that my comic is poor quality?
14-05-2020T22:43:00,AspiringNoodle,Maybe character heads in the periphery so we know who's talking
14-05-2020T22:43:07,Ordithus,some things might be fine not being said
14-05-2020T22:43:16,Ordithus,I say this not knowing what you're trying to say :P
14-05-2020T22:43:22,AspiringNoodle,Oh sage~

14-05-2020T22:57:11,BeeMill,You get a pardon
14-05-2020T22:57:19,Ustudios,its weird sage
14-05-2020T22:57:24,Ustudios,because that is my sister in a nutshell
14-05-2020T22:57:26,AspiringNoodle,And a lifetime supply of air freshener? :ptv-laugh:
14-05-2020T22:57:38,Ustudios,she can eat cheese no problem but takes a glass of milk and she goes for a ride
14-05-2020T22:57:40,SageSaga,i love cheese- but yeah i am lactos-intolerant
14-05-2020T22:57:41,KeefMcDerpface,What if I just wear the chees hat?

14-05-2020T22:57:45,Ordithus,cheese doesn't effect me nearly as much
14-05-2020T22:58:00,Ustudios,I think it also has to do with the process to make cheese from the milk
14-05-2020T22:58:11,BeeMill,"We are a sympathetic people, we will accept almond milk"
14-05-2020T22:58:23,KeefMcDerpface,"Oh, that's good."

14-05-2020T23:17:10,Ordithus,so what is your wizard's low stat?
14-05-2020T23:17:18,Tharkis,we determined that just rolling 4d6-L  stats really just made... average characters
14-05-2020T23:17:23,AspiringNoodle,But at the same time be smart enough to use intricate spells or zealous enough to throw lightning bolts
14-05-2020T23:17:42,Tharkis,so we started letting peopel roll 4d6-L to get their total stat 'pool' and then adjust anything up or down by 2 as long as the total stayed the same
14-05-2020T23:17:46,Tharkis,and it made for much more variety
14-05-2020T23:17:50,Tharkis,and customization
14-05-2020T23:18:13,ShamusTheFox,I started with 3D6. It's still my favorite for just taking what you get and working with it.
