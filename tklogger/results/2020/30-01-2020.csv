30-01-2020T13:59:14,tehbear,are we talking vinyl?
30-01-2020T14:01:23,TerraTheWizard,the vod of sunday's stream
30-01-2020T14:03:58,tehbear,a fragment lost in time
30-01-2020T14:04:30,tehbear,vod = video right?
30-01-2020T14:05:02,tehbear,A techno-geek acronym for Video-On-Demand.
30-01-2020T15:18:45,SpazztasticKiwi,well folks anthrocon might be out the window
30-01-2020T15:20:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom do you know what booth you‚Äôll be at yet
30-01-2020T15:24:13,Twokinds,nop
30-01-2020T15:24:57,SpazztasticKiwi,yeah I figured it‚Äôs too early
30-01-2020T15:26:32,SpazztasticKiwi,back to laundry then
30-01-2020T15:28:58,tehbear,:spinningcat
30-01-2020T15:29:26,tehbear,where is Neon?
30-01-2020T15:33:33,SpazztasticKiwi,I just did the 2 second shirt fold trick
30-01-2020T15:33:41,SpazztasticKiwi,it works at least
30-01-2020T15:34:25,tehbear,i just hang them up to launDRY. makes for less wrinkles
30-01-2020T15:34:46,SpazztasticKiwi,I can‚Äôt hang up all my clothes
30-01-2020T15:35:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"besides, they‚Äôre not wrinkly material"
30-01-2020T15:35:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I hang up my youtuber shirts and hoodies to keep the cat hair off
30-01-2020T15:35:37,SpazztasticKiwi,as poorly effective as that is
30-01-2020T15:35:40,tehbear,you dont have one of those rollers?
30-01-2020T15:35:47,tehbear,the sticky rollingpin
30-01-2020T15:36:16,SpazztasticKiwi,does no good if the hair magnitizes as soon as you put it on
30-01-2020T15:36:38,SpazztasticKiwi,only way a lint pin is useful is if I‚Äôm already out of the house
30-01-2020T15:36:47,tehbear,hehe
30-01-2020T15:37:06,tehbear,i keep mine in the entrance
30-01-2020T15:37:06,SpazztasticKiwi,"but with a long and shorthair cat, plus my mom and sisters cats, I‚Äôm gonna have hairs"
30-01-2020T15:37:12,tehbear,use it before going to wokr
30-01-2020T15:37:31,tehbear,sometimes. most days i just accept fluff
30-01-2020T15:37:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"good part is since most of the shirts and Marks hoodie is black, Bagheera‚Äôs hair doesn‚Äôt show up"
30-01-2020T15:38:16,tehbear,i have the opposite color problem
30-01-2020T15:38:29,SpazztasticKiwi,"meanwhile, in the middle of folding a shirt, Bagheera: sits directly on top of current shirt being folded"
30-01-2020T15:39:05,tehbear,my samoyed only shows up if there is food. so thats not a problem
30-01-2020T15:39:25,tehbear,but he has is own corner on the couch
30-01-2020T15:39:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"my longhair cat is a calico, so I get anything from white to orange to black hairs from her"
30-01-2020T15:40:03,SpazztasticKiwi,"or grey, not black"
30-01-2020T15:40:20,tehbear,"we had an elkhound, it has brown and black hairs with a white tip"
30-01-2020T15:40:34,tehbear,and white fluffy undercoat
30-01-2020T15:40:51,tehbear,shed way more than the samoyed does
30-01-2020T15:41:11,tehbear,fluffbunnies in every corner 1 week after cleaning
30-01-2020T15:41:40,SpazztasticKiwi,cat has decided to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù folding
30-01-2020T15:41:56,tehbear,they better at folding than computers
30-01-2020T15:42:01,SpazztasticKiwi,by sitting in my lap and blocking half my view & movement
30-01-2020T15:42:22,tehbear,:ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
30-01-2020T15:43:20,tehbear,its also funny how cats seem to have a thing for people who are allergic to them
30-01-2020T15:43:46,tehbear,*sorry cat. cant get to close*
30-01-2020T15:44:03,tehbear,cat becomes magnet
30-01-2020T15:44:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I e been told I‚Äôm allergic but I‚Äôve yet to have problems
30-01-2020T15:45:16,tehbear,"i used to be very allergic, but it stopped once i was around 18-20"
30-01-2020T15:46:41,tehbear,"my brother was reading a book about William Adams and how the Dutch, English and Portuguese first made contact with Japan in year 1600"
30-01-2020T15:48:43,tehbear,"there was a story about a captain at the time, who was very proud of the lewd paintings he had onboard his ship. For example Botticellis ""Birth of Venus"""
30-01-2020T15:49:01,tehbear,the moment i heard that I was thinking maybe that was Toms inspiration for Eric
30-01-2020T15:49:53,tehbear,but its probably just coincidence
30-01-2020T15:51:25,SpazztasticKiwi,most of those old god paintings were coveted
30-01-2020T15:51:36,SpazztasticKiwi,whole reason we still have them
30-01-2020T15:52:22,tehbear,"i bet people in the church wanted them destroyed. otoh, many of them were commissioned by the church"
30-01-2020T15:52:50,tehbear,"maybe differences between orthodox and catholic, and protestant, and all those variants"
30-01-2020T16:00:53,SpazztasticKiwi,I may be jumping the gun rewashing clothes and packing now but otherwise I‚Äôd forget something
30-01-2020T16:01:35,tehbear,looked it up on wikipedia and found the captain was John Saris 1580-1643
30-01-2020T16:02:09,tehbear,"he tried to establish trade with japan, wool. but the japanese were only interested in wearing silk"
30-01-2020T16:02:32,tehbear,but for some reason he went along and tried to ship wool from england anyway
30-01-2020T16:04:53,tehbear,better to be prepared Kiwi
30-01-2020T16:06:00,tehbear,PreptasticKiwi
30-01-2020T16:06:46,tehbear,ready for the last minute out just-about-to-leave thing you forgot

30-01-2020T22:41:29,SageSaga,it arrived at my post office and then they sent it to some place called Afton!
30-01-2020T22:41:30,ShamusTheFox,I may have the flu. SPEC-TACULAR.
30-01-2020T22:41:39,IronHorseComics,wat
30-01-2020T22:41:41,IronHorseComics,why?
30-01-2020T22:41:45,IronHorseComics,can they not read?
30-01-2020T22:41:50,Ordithus,"Ick, get better Shamus"
30-01-2020T22:42:23,ShamusTheFox,Working on it. Under the covers and not planning on doing anything.
30-01-2020T22:43:35,Kynum,Maybe Afton needs that package more?
30-01-2020T22:43:55,SageSaga,So they can send it back?
30-01-2020T22:44:00,Kynum,yes
30-01-2020T22:44:17,Kynum,more exercise for them :3
30-01-2020T22:45:28,SageSaga,look- this means it came into the state- went to Richmond in the middle of the state- then got sent to my home town to the East of Richmond- then from my home town it got sent to THE MOUNTAINS! WEST OF RICHMOND
30-01-2020T22:45:44,ShamusTheFox,It was Izma.
30-01-2020T22:45:48,ShamusTheFox,Yzma.

30-01-2020T22:46:01,ShamusTheFox,She's gonna smash it with a hammer.
30-01-2020T22:46:25,Ordithus,It's going to the mountains!
30-01-2020T22:47:27,SageSaga,tracking still says it will be here by 8pm tonight though...

30-01-2020T22:48:37,IronHorseComics,still though that's odd
30-01-2020T22:48:50,IronHorseComics,why would they make a mistake that monumental?
30-01-2020T22:49:07,Kynum,Maybe they're in the UK.

30-01-2020T23:00:06,ShamusTheFox,But I have the story in my head OK.
30-01-2020T23:01:12,Ordithus,So far Henry seems nice

30-01-2020T23:08:37,SageSaga,the ban hammer can hit low things just fine
30-01-2020T23:08:47,LannAF,but what about things with the high ground
30-01-2020T23:09:08,SageSaga,The ban hammer has the throwing property
30-01-2020T23:09:17,LannAF,so you take disadvantage

30-01-2020T23:09:45,SageSaga,wrong- see this is why i worry about you DMing

30-01-2020T23:10:08,SageSaga,i get that reference
30-01-2020T23:10:55,LannAF,wat
30-01-2020T23:11:04,LannAF,wasn't high ground an advantage
30-01-2020T23:11:09,LannAF,or is that for certain class
30-01-2020T23:11:11,LannAF,I recall that
30-01-2020T23:11:21,ShamusTheFox,I haven't played D & D / Pathfinder for a while. Miss it.
30-01-2020T23:11:39,SageSaga,it is not advantage unless there is a reason for it- such as firing down on people from a castle wall
30-01-2020T23:11:59,SageSaga,it does not impose disadvantage if the weapons range can reach
30-01-2020T23:12:14,Ordithus,you may be surprised but in melee the high ground can make you more vulnerable
30-01-2020T23:12:28,Ordithus,"you're wide open, and can only swing for noggins"
