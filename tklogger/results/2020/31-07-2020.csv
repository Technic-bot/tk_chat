31-07-2020T16:01:10,Ordithus,wb sage

31-07-2020T16:02:09,CrRAR,"At sage's house, party comes to you!"
31-07-2020T16:02:13,SageSaga,"so they were like ""hey we are going out to dinner- come with us!"""
31-07-2020T16:02:24,SageSaga,"and im like - ""I have work to do and i dont like surprises"""
31-07-2020T16:02:26,CrRAR,What are the rates?
31-07-2020T16:02:31,CrRAR,*eats
31-07-2020T16:02:46,CrimsonQuill,In my opinion family comes first
31-07-2020T16:03:08,SageSaga,in my opinion- if you want to do something ya make plans and tell people first
31-07-2020T16:03:14,CrRAR,Yeah
31-07-2020T16:03:24,CrimsonQuill,Good point. I apologise.
31-07-2020T16:03:29,CrimsonQuill,Sorry.
31-07-2020T16:03:48,CrimsonQuill,Didn't mean to sound rude.
31-07-2020T16:03:51,CrRAR,Especially when you can be committed to arts
31-07-2020T16:04:57,CrimsonQuill,Please pardon my comment
31-07-2020T16:05:10,SageSaga,i got to see my newest baby nephew though so that was good
31-07-2020T16:05:23,Ordithus,d'aww
31-07-2020T16:05:35,SageSaga,his name is August- and hes a chunky baby XD
31-07-2020T16:05:36,CrimsonQuill,:D
31-07-2020T16:05:41,CrimsonQuill,Chonk
31-07-2020T16:06:06,Ordithus,but was he born in July?
31-07-2020T16:06:13,SageSaga,no
31-07-2020T16:06:21,SageSaga,but he wasnt born in August either
31-07-2020T16:07:05,IronHorseComics,he was born in ... Smarch
31-07-2020T16:07:18,CrimsonQuill,Gonna say night
31-07-2020T16:07:20,CrimsonQuill,Cya guys
31-07-2020T16:07:24,CrimsonQuill,:ptv-sleepy::ptv-sleepy::ptv-sleepy:
31-07-2020T16:07:27,Ordithus,night crim
31-07-2020T16:07:53,SageSaga,take care
31-07-2020T16:08:06,Rosscoe,and back
31-07-2020T16:09:15,SageSaga,oh i almost finished that new book already
31-07-2020T16:09:24,Rosscoe,new book?
31-07-2020T16:09:34,SageSaga,i was wondering why it had an explicit content warning- and now i know!
31-07-2020T16:10:47,SageSaga,the book about a guy who gets reincarnated as a Behemoth- but hes just a baby Behemoth so he looks like a kitten and gets picked up by an elf girl?
31-07-2020T16:11:35,SageSaga,I thought this would be different from the usual stuff-  where an OP character meets a girl and the girl falls in love with him- i was like - well this will be different- hes a cat
31-07-2020T16:11:48,SageSaga,"but it turns out this elf girl is like ""Mhmmm a cat is fine too"""
31-07-2020T16:12:08,Ordithus,:cw0lfmare-Disappoint:
31-07-2020T16:12:14,IronHorseComics,"""Crap, I went against my better judgement!"" -Sage"
31-07-2020T16:13:11,SageSaga,"like- im not even kidding- she finds out he might be an elemental cat and is like ""wow so cool!"" and this woman is like ""whoa- be careful- i heard that some elemental cats get attached to their owners and try to mate with them once they are like tigers!"""
31-07-2020T16:13:44,IronHorseComics,... because why not?
31-07-2020T16:13:54,SageSaga,"and the elf girl says- out loud - ""Thats exactly what I want! You kitty can be my first!"" and im like ""wait- wait- what!?"""
31-07-2020T16:13:54,Ordithus,bad demonic cat
31-07-2020T16:13:55,BadFoMo,Back for a bit. ...My degenrate mind is acting up for panel 1.
31-07-2020T16:14:16,IronHorseComics,"she falls under the ""You sick bastard"" level on the furry chart"
31-07-2020T16:15:21,SageSaga,so yeah- . . . i dont think im gonna keep reading the series and i hope it doesnt get an anime
31-07-2020T16:15:34,SageSaga,omg how would they make this an anime
31-07-2020T16:15:49,AspiringNoodle,Holy crap
31-07-2020T16:16:02,SageSaga,I get it- Japan has put out serious animes about incest but- this? they wouldnt- would they?!
31-07-2020T16:16:04,AspiringNoodle,"That book is ""A cat is fine too"" taken to its lewdical limit :ptv-ohmy:"
31-07-2020T16:17:14,Ordithus,but it's really a demon so it's ok :csagesaga-philhuh:
31-07-2020T16:17:29,AspiringNoodle,"Also, have you seen Ishuzoku Reviewers? :ptv-ohmy:"
31-07-2020T16:17:31,SageSaga,its not a demon
31-07-2020T16:17:41,AspiringNoodle,"At this point, I think nothing, NOTHING, is off the table"
31-07-2020T16:17:44,SageSaga,no i havent- because it got pulled by Funimation
31-07-2020T16:17:56,AspiringNoodle,Apparently there's a gag in the first episode
31-07-2020T16:18:13,AspiringNoodle,Two of the main characters talking about how awesome elves are
31-07-2020T16:18:22,AspiringNoodle,They can be hundreds of years old but look like they're in their 20's
31-07-2020T16:19:06,AspiringNoodle,Then apparently an elf sex worker is talking about how awesome humans are
31-07-2020T16:19:39,AspiringNoodle,"Dude sleeps with older women (I think in some cases 50 - 60+), and loves how youthful their mana is"
31-07-2020T16:19:40,Rosscoe,I watched all 12 episodes
31-07-2020T16:19:42,Rosscoe,it as funny
31-07-2020T16:19:54,Rosscoe,was*
31-07-2020T16:20:24,AspiringNoodle,"So basically, humans like elves because they look ""young"" basically forever"
31-07-2020T16:20:24,Rosscoe,Then its like 500+ year old elve woman have no mana
31-07-2020T16:20:39,AspiringNoodle,But elves like older humans because their mana is so young :ptv-laugh:
31-07-2020T16:21:11,Rosscoe,"Then there was the low level succubi pit,"
31-07-2020T16:21:34,Rosscoe,"and the exit door is a chute when they are ""done"" with them"
31-07-2020T16:22:16,AspiringNoodle,"So yeah, I think the point is: When it comes to a giant kitty doing an elf for her first time because she wants it"
31-07-2020T16:22:18,AspiringNoodle,THEY WILL.
31-07-2020T16:23:01,SageSaga,it kinda sucks going from a really well written interesting story to a poorly written not really interesting story
31-07-2020T16:23:07,Rosscoe,"Kinda sounds like this adult manga that was rereleased, updated text, de censored and scene's re-added as the orginal author / artist was able too."
31-07-2020T16:24:03,Rosscoe,However a GOOD story going terrible...just why..WHY?!
31-07-2020T16:24:08,AspiringNoodle,We'll just have to wait and see how they handle it
31-07-2020T16:24:59,SageSaga,A lot of light novels are written in First Person Perspective
31-07-2020T16:25:05,SageSaga,which at first i found a little odd
31-07-2020T16:25:14,SageSaga,but it seems to work pretty well
31-07-2020T16:25:38,SageSaga,this was one of the first light novels i read that was not first person-  all the time-
31-07-2020T16:25:56,SageSaga,that was the problem- it was usually 3rd person- but it kept switching to first person and back out
31-07-2020T16:26:14,SageSaga,but the absolute WORSE part about the writing-
31-07-2020T16:27:00,SageSaga,randomly giving information that the reader shouldnt know at a point it isnt relevant- that none of the characters know about either- AFTER HINTING
31-07-2020T16:27:38,AspiringNoodle,Oh boy
31-07-2020T16:27:49,Rosscoe,NOPE
31-07-2020T16:27:51,AspiringNoodle,Lot's of chekhov's guns?
31-07-2020T16:27:53,Rosscoe,bit NOPE too that
31-07-2020T16:27:59,Rosscoe,big*
31-07-2020T16:28:15,Rosscoe,that's a story sounding so akward even I would burn the book
31-07-2020T16:28:15,SageSaga,"think of it this way ""The two characters locks eyes- for a moment time seems to slow, they get interrupted and go back to normal. Oh by the way they totally fell in love right there- they are gonna bang later, you didnt have to know about that right now-"
31-07-2020T16:28:38,AspiringNoodle,...so chekhov's gun... AND straight up spoilers...
31-07-2020T16:28:44,SageSaga,"im just like ""WHY?!"""
31-07-2020T16:29:18,AspiringNoodle,Nothing wrong with a little bit of world building
31-07-2020T16:29:30,AspiringNoodle,"But if you make mention of it, at least have it be relevant"
31-07-2020T16:29:42,AspiringNoodle,"And if it isn't relevant until later, SAVE IT FOR LATER *facepalm*"
31-07-2020T16:29:48,SageSaga,"2 Chapters later ya find out- its like- yah like they show Chekov's gun and then the narrator is like ""Hey! Look at that gun! Its gonna be used to slay the demon in the next chapter!"""
31-07-2020T16:30:17,Rosscoe,Sounds more like a story board for a animated series
31-07-2020T16:30:28,AspiringNoodle,I... I can't even right now
31-07-2020T16:30:36,Rosscoe,and its being used in a book
31-07-2020T16:30:45,Ordithus,it's like watching a movie with someone who just screams spoilers out all the time
31-07-2020T16:30:46,Rosscoe,but badly
31-07-2020T16:30:47,AspiringNoodle,Instead of going for subtlety and foreshadowing
31-07-2020T16:30:48,Rosscoe,real badly
31-07-2020T16:30:57,AspiringNoodle,They're literally just bashing you over the head with upcoming events???
31-07-2020T16:31:27,SageSaga,"""The sly noble slips a piece of paper into the hand of the king who doesn't read it yet. When he does he'll find out that his army is under attack- this is why the MC wont be able to meet the king later like they plan"" WHY?! JUST SAVE IT!"
31-07-2020T16:31:44,AspiringNoodle,"""Okay, you know that super cute couple on a date in that cafe?  They gonna fug after that.  Then they gonna cuddle.  Then they gonna have an awkward conversation next morning."""
31-07-2020T16:32:00,AspiringNoodle,"""Oh look, they're leaving the cafe, let's follow them!  And now they're fugging! :D"""
31-07-2020T16:32:02,Ordithus,it reads like notes the author left for themselves
31-07-2020T16:32:15,SageSaga,exactly
31-07-2020T16:32:29,SageSaga,im like- just save it- let the moment stand on its own
31-07-2020T16:32:41,AspiringNoodle,Let me see if I can salvage this paragraph.
31-07-2020T16:33:30,Rosscoe,Must be people who are into that sort of reading?
31-07-2020T16:33:58,SageSaga,"""My arent you a handsome young man"", the woman ran her hands over his shoulders- he tightened up suddenly. He did this because hes gay, not because he likes her though- so this will probably cause a misunderstanding - right now- ""Oh? You like that?"" See?"
31-07-2020T16:34:08,AspiringNoodle,"""The sly noble slips a piece of paper into the hand of the king.  The king, showing no interest in its contents, places it off to the side for later.  The noble seems anxious at his actions, but holds his tongue."""
31-07-2020T16:35:09,AspiringNoodle,Like... how hard would it have been to do ^
31-07-2020T16:35:20,AspiringNoodle,"Scene stands on its own, foreshadows later events"
31-07-2020T16:36:06,SageSaga,"exactly Noodle- and then- when the noble says the King cant meet with him later he can be like ""Oh- so thats what that note was-"" ""Indeed, he didnt want to be rude but as a king, neglecting something for a moment can mean a great difference."""
31-07-2020T16:36:56,SageSaga,"AND THATS WRITING 101! Why did this person decide ""I DONT NEED THAT! IM GONNA SPOIL RANDOM BULL CRAP!"""
31-07-2020T16:37:05,AspiringNoodle,An amatuer should not be able to outright a professional...
31-07-2020T16:37:14,AspiringNoodle,out-write*
31-07-2020T16:37:30,Rosscoe,Sounds bad.
31-07-2020T16:38:02,SageSaga,"""Harry, this is professor Snape"" Professor Snape seems rude and mean to harry but he was actually in love with Harrys mom and hated his father, but hes a good man that will risk his life for Harry some day"""
31-07-2020T16:38:15,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-laugh:
31-07-2020T16:38:17,AspiringNoodle,Nailed it!
31-07-2020T16:38:52,CrRAR,Oh wow nice effect
31-07-2020T16:39:29,SageSaga,"""I am professor Dumbledore"" Dumbledore was a strange man- and one day- Professor Snape would kill him- but only because he had to, he is after all- a good guy in bad circumstances"
31-07-2020T16:39:31,Ordithus,sage I hope no trees were sacrificed for this horror
31-07-2020T16:40:12,AspiringNoodle,"The more you do this, the more that novel sounds like it was written by a child who can't hold any secrets for later"
31-07-2020T16:40:20,AspiringNoodle,They have to blurt out EVERYTHING immediately once it comes to mind
31-07-2020T16:40:32,SageSaga,it could be- they let young kids write lightnovels
31-07-2020T16:40:54,CrRAR,"""Harry, I like the part of you that's your mother"""
31-07-2020T16:41:09,CrRAR,Snape basically
31-07-2020T16:41:15,SageSaga,By that Snape meant his eyes
31-07-2020T16:41:22,CrRAR,xD
31-07-2020T16:41:40,Ordithus,I'm sure Snape x Harry is a thing

31-07-2020T16:42:48,SageSaga,see? This way of writing ruins everything
31-07-2020T16:44:48,SageSaga,now again- that wasnt a constant thing- but the fact that it happened 2 or 3 times in the book-
31-07-2020T16:47:09,AspiringNoodle,Even once is egregious
31-07-2020T16:47:26,AspiringNoodle,"2 or 3 times is ""How the f*ck did an editor approve this?!?"""

31-07-2020T17:13:38,Ordithus,that's basically reality after everything opened up and nothing is closing back down after spikes.  though she might not be coming at it from that perspective
31-07-2020T17:13:40,SageSaga,you cant live with a virus that has a high mortality rate- because it literally kills people
31-07-2020T17:14:41,AspiringNoodle,My thoughts are that that's a great way to cause a lot of unnecessary deaths...
31-07-2020T17:15:29,AspiringNoodle,"Vaccines are proving promising.  If we go to straight, ""Fuck it, we'll all die someday, why bother."", all we'll do is make things worse from a temporary situation"
31-07-2020T17:15:33,SageSaga,if by we just need to live with it they mean- you need to always wear a mask and wash your hands- maybe? I mean- we've had pandemics before- but they either die out from medicine being made effective against it- vaccines being made or natural immunity
31-07-2020T17:15:41,SageSaga,after it burns its way through most of the world
31-07-2020T17:16:05,AspiringNoodle,I was bringing up a story about one of the few schools that opened back up
31-07-2020T17:16:19,AspiringNoodle,And they had to quarantine literally after the first day because a student tested positive
31-07-2020T17:16:22,SageSaga,im kinda partial to the vaccine or new treatments- not a fan of the Plague Method
31-07-2020T17:16:36,AspiringNoodle,It's like... how much money you want to bet that the school was stuffed to capacity
31-07-2020T17:16:36,Ordithus,so does she mean f it all and just go back to life like there was no virus? cuz that's not a good way to go
31-07-2020T17:16:55,SageSaga,how about that kid that went to a school- got covid- got his parents sick- and now he has no parents?
31-07-2020T17:17:08,SageSaga,because thats a thing that happened
31-07-2020T17:17:38,SageSaga,kid gets to grow up knowing he killed his parents
31-07-2020T17:17:56,AspiringNoodle,And then gets pissed off at the government for forcing him to go to school
31-07-2020T17:18:08,AspiringNoodle,Get sick when he didn't need to
31-07-2020T17:18:12,AspiringNoodle,And now you've got a future terrorist
31-07-2020T17:19:40,AspiringNoodle,"Anyways, I think my mother is completely against any sort of hard lockdowns or quarantines"
31-07-2020T17:19:56,AspiringNoodle,Even though that one kid likely infected every single classroom he was in...
31-07-2020T17:20:17,AspiringNoodle,"Densely packed, small enclosed space, long-term exposure"
31-07-2020T17:20:29,Ordithus,"there's an outbreak in a county near me from a summer camp.  kids are all super spreaders, man"
31-07-2020T17:20:50,AspiringNoodle,There's a study that's on blast
31-07-2020T17:21:01,AspiringNoodle,It says that kids are unlikely to be seriously affected by covid
31-07-2020T17:21:08,SageSaga,ha
31-07-2020T17:21:15,AspiringNoodle,"Okay, let's say that's true"
31-07-2020T17:21:20,SageSaga,it isnt
31-07-2020T17:21:38,AspiringNoodle,But we have other studies saying they could be carrying viral loads magnitudes larger than normal
31-07-2020T17:21:55,AspiringNoodle,You've got literal walking diseases at that point
31-07-2020T17:22:01,AspiringNoodle,"They might not suffer, but everyone around them might"
31-07-2020T17:22:40,SageSaga,while death rates in children and young adults are smaller - both kids and young adults are able to have some serious side effects that will last a lifetime
31-07-2020T17:22:41,AspiringNoodle,"This callousness of people putting their lives at risk for ""muh economy"" is fucking moronic, pisses me off"
31-07-2020T17:23:18,AspiringNoodle,"If I didn't live with my parents, I might have stopped talking to them until the vaccine is made and this pandemic is over"
31-07-2020T17:23:20,Ordithus,I'm all for Lockdown 2: Lockdown Harder
31-07-2020T17:23:41,SageSaga,when ya have a snow storm ya close schools- when ya have a hurricane you shut down a city- when ya have a Pandemic you do what you can to STOP IT
31-07-2020T17:23:58,Ordithus,'specially as there is actual spread here now.
31-07-2020T17:24:17,SageSaga,"Lock Down 2 - This time, we mean it"
31-07-2020T17:24:22,AspiringNoodle,I actually have a good hypothetical for the snowstorm
31-07-2020T17:24:40,AspiringNoodle,Let's say the first week is getting like 6 inches per day
31-07-2020T17:24:48,AspiringNoodle,And they shut everything down.
31-07-2020T17:24:54,AspiringNoodle,They get things under control
31-07-2020T17:25:04,AspiringNoodle,It's down to like 2 inches per day for 2 weeks
31-07-2020T17:25:11,AspiringNoodle,"Then on the third week, it's a foot a day"
31-07-2020T17:25:13,Ordithus,hehe 6 inches is a Tuesday here
31-07-2020T17:25:16,Ordithus,stops nothing
31-07-2020T17:25:19,AspiringNoodle,And then a foot and a half the following week
31-07-2020T17:25:22,Ordithus,but I digress
31-07-2020T17:25:39,AspiringNoodle,"And they're like, ""Eff it, we can barely keep the roads clear, accidents on the rise, people are stuck in their homes, but let's open it all back up!"""
31-07-2020T17:26:26,AspiringNoodle,"Whereas a more realistic scenario would be, ""...let's evacuate people until the snow stops."""
31-07-2020T17:28:53,SageSaga,"""ive got this crazy idea - let's do - what these other countries did that succeeded!"" ""naaaah those countries are lame"""
31-07-2020T17:30:36,SageSaga,ya know- i think one of the worse things has been Trump talking about how testing is hurting us
31-07-2020T17:30:59,SageSaga,because it highlights just how incredibly stupid he is- and it should make it so obvious to anyone who hears him say it-
31-07-2020T17:31:52,SageSaga,"like- i can get it when people heard him say it at first- it was like ""haha! no one is really that dumb- good joke"" and then they keep listening- they should immediately realize- this is not a joke to him"
31-07-2020T17:31:54,SageSaga,hes serious
31-07-2020T17:32:13,AspiringNoodle,I'm just hoping more people wear a mask
31-07-2020T17:32:18,SageSaga,he seriously thinks that testing is bad- not because of the data it gives us- but because the numbers make him look bad
31-07-2020T17:32:20,AspiringNoodle,'cuz now even he is advocating for them :/
31-07-2020T17:32:39,Ordithus,at least I'm seeing near 100% mask wearing here
31-07-2020T17:32:46,Ordithus,aside from little kids
31-07-2020T17:32:58,AspiringNoodle,"Tbh, the whole government is a giant joke at this point"
31-07-2020T17:33:08,SageSaga,not the whole government-
31-07-2020T17:33:19,AspiringNoodle,"Trump / feds are like ""Eeeeeeh, let the states figure out how they want to handle it."""
31-07-2020T17:33:32,AspiringNoodle,"Some states are, ""Ha, yeah right, we ain't doing shit."""
31-07-2020T17:33:42,AspiringNoodle,Others are *all procedures possible*
31-07-2020T17:35:03,Ordithus,that wall run :ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
31-07-2020T17:35:17,Ordithus,[whee!]*:csagesaga-kaylinheart:
31-07-2020T17:35:34,SageSaga,my states Governor might be pretty stupid as far as decisions he made in his life and his political choices- but he used to be an actual practicing doctor- hes taking the pandemic seriously
31-07-2020T17:35:49,SageSaga,and being hampered by the Federal Government
31-07-2020T17:36:17,AspiringNoodle,My governor also took this seriously
31-07-2020T17:36:24,Ordithus,same
31-07-2020T17:36:45,AspiringNoodle,He locked down the state to the point that politicians from BOTH parties started a suit against him to re-open
31-07-2020T17:36:58,AspiringNoodle,We went the full 12 weeks
31-07-2020T17:37:15,AspiringNoodle,"And now that cases are on the rise in the state, all counties are back in yellow"
31-07-2020T17:37:34,AspiringNoodle,"He said that he went so hard during the first lockdown that he didn't consider a 2nd one an option, so he planned to make it count"
31-07-2020T17:38:05,AspiringNoodle,"That said, I don't doubt that if things get *really* bad, that he'll put us back in lockdown"
31-07-2020T17:38:35,AspiringNoodle,"Ofc, if certain politicians don't pull their heads out of their collective asses, a 2nd lockdown really won't be an option -_-"
31-07-2020T17:40:37,SageSaga,is trump even still wearing his mask? ive only ever seen him wear it for photos and that one time he came out with it- again for a photo op
31-07-2020T17:41:13,AspiringNoodle,"I believe he is.  He mentioned at one point that it's uncomfortable, but he's getting used to wearing it"
31-07-2020T17:41:59,SageSaga,he retweeted that woman saying you dont need to wear masks and that there is already a cure
31-07-2020T17:43:00,AspiringNoodle,"We have a ""cure"" in the loosest of contexts"
31-07-2020T17:43:08,AspiringNoodle,We have a vaccine entering phase 3
31-07-2020T17:43:24,AspiringNoodle,"If it works there, I can't remember if it moves on to larger trials or moves on to mass production"
31-07-2020T17:43:27,Ordithus,not what he was talking about
31-07-2020T17:43:55,SageSaga,she was saying that Hydroxie clorwhatever was a cure
31-07-2020T17:44:05,AspiringNoodle,"Ord, if you would"
31-07-2020T17:45:05,Ordithus,if I would what
31-07-2020T17:45:13,AspiringNoodle,There's an emote for what sage said

31-07-2020T17:58:22,AspiringNoodle,Fun big:  There's a theory that succubi and incubi are actually one-and-the-same
31-07-2020T17:58:29,AspiringNoodle,fun bit*
