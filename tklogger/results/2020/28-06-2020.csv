28-06-2020T13:54:36,SpazztasticKiwi,thatâ€™s rare
28-06-2020T14:43:05,AspiringNoodle,I slept until 3 pm :|
28-06-2020T14:43:10,AspiringNoodle,My body refused to sleep well
28-06-2020T14:43:35,TerraTheWizard,oop
28-06-2020T14:49:16,TerraTheWizard,so just had a fun thought while chatting with friends
28-06-2020T14:49:27,TerraTheWizard,they were asking where tom's pizza is based and how he gets everywhere
28-06-2020T14:49:48,TerraTheWizard,so i said maybe it's like officer jenny/nurse joy in pokÃ©mon
28-06-2020T14:50:02,TerraTheWizard,and there's a bunch of delivery boy tom's out there
28-06-2020T14:50:59,AspiringNoodle,^^^
28-06-2020T14:51:19,AspiringNoodle,"Honestly, I love the absurdity of the duo"
28-06-2020T14:51:41,AspiringNoodle,The odds of THAT many members of a family looking 100% identical
28-06-2020T14:52:06,AspiringNoodle,And picking up the same profession
28-06-2020T14:52:16,AspiringNoodle,And being located in EVERY city / locale
28-06-2020T14:52:47,AspiringNoodle,And then for them to be the staple until the end of time
28-06-2020T14:54:59,AspiringNoodle,"Hey Terra, how's covid treating where you live?"
28-06-2020T14:58:05,TerraTheWizard,non-essential businesses started reopening last week
28-06-2020T14:58:11,TerraTheWizard,so it's getting busy out again
28-06-2020T14:58:34,TerraTheWizard,i think schools reopened today
28-06-2020T14:58:57,TerraTheWizard,think there's still a restriction on traveling more than 5 miles though
28-06-2020T15:09:41,AspiringNoodle,"I'm just watching US covid cases spike, lol"
28-06-2020T15:09:55,AspiringNoodle,I actually stopped for a while because the downward curve was reliable
28-06-2020T15:10:56,AspiringNoodle,"New cases dipped for the past 2 days, but I expect new cases to tick upward again :/"

28-06-2020T17:19:26,AspiringNoodle,Why can't I get the full res image from da...
28-06-2020T17:19:31,AspiringNoodle,I can't see any options anywhere
28-06-2020T17:22:29,Twokinds,Can you not?
28-06-2020T17:22:40,Twokinds,Lemme check
28-06-2020T17:23:05,Twokinds,"Ah, dang it. dA changed their uploader. Download was unchecked by default. I checked it."
28-06-2020T17:23:12,Twokinds,You should be able to download it now.
28-06-2020T17:39:23,Dadrobit,"Damn. My test results still aren't in, and no response from my letter. Really disconcerting. Family got tested the same day and they all recieved their results a day ago."

28-06-2020T17:41:25,Dadrobit,fffuuuuuuu-
28-06-2020T17:44:30,AspiringNoodle,Thanks Tom <3
28-06-2020T17:45:04,AspiringNoodle,And my money is on it being a human error somewhere
28-06-2020T18:00:04,CrRAR,nice
28-06-2020T18:57:32,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-maddiessparkles:
28-06-2020T19:34:31,AspiringNoodle,"Someone please remind me in the future when I inevitably want to play Apex Legends again that I'm gonna enjoy it for a day, and then get *really* pissed off"
28-06-2020T19:47:35,Xexanoth,isn't that pretty much every multiplayer game...
28-06-2020T19:52:02,AspiringNoodle,Apex is rather unique in that they tend to break the game in unexpected ways
28-06-2020T19:52:27,AspiringNoodle,"And since it's a battle royale title, you need the core gameplay to be flawless, because the genre punishes mistakes / inattentiveness by default"
28-06-2020T19:52:43,AspiringNoodle,But then to get screwed over by something out of your control?  Unacceptable
28-06-2020T19:55:15,AspiringNoodle,"This time around, there's a new skin for one of the legends from the new *cough* cash grab *cough* event, that's completely broken her hitboxes :/"
28-06-2020T19:55:46,AspiringNoodle,"Initially it removed the head hitbox, so you couldn't get critical damage.  Supposedly they fixed that, but the model is still prone to no reg hits"
28-06-2020T19:57:30,AspiringNoodle,...sorry for wall of text ._.
28-06-2020T19:57:51,Xexanoth,"sounds like pretty standard MMO stuff to me, people breking their games with new unbalanced stuff is pretty standard..."
28-06-2020T19:58:10,Xexanoth,bonus points for accidental pay2win
28-06-2020T19:59:28,AspiringNoodle,Respawn need to be *really* careful though
28-06-2020T19:59:46,AspiringNoodle,"This game has a ranked mode, and you can't keep introducing game-breaking stuff like that every update"
28-06-2020T20:00:11,AspiringNoodle,"BR is too unforgiving for that.  Game like Overwatch?  Okay, you might be able to adapt and overcome"
28-06-2020T20:00:30,AspiringNoodle,"But BR you only get one chance a match, and you gotta react on the fly"
28-06-2020T20:00:45,AspiringNoodle,"And if the game decides to delete half your clip and not your opponent's, gg"
28-06-2020T20:03:24,AspiringNoodle,Guess it's back to scaring myself silly in Amnesia
28-06-2020T20:03:28,AspiringNoodle,I think I'm finally near the end :D
28-06-2020T20:05:55,AspiringNoodle,"any live-service games you like playing, Xexa?"
28-06-2020T20:06:14,Xexanoth,World of Tanks on occassion
28-06-2020T20:06:35,Xexanoth,which mostly is me trying to figure out which new horribly broken vehicles they added to the game
28-06-2020T20:07:03,AspiringNoodle,I stopped playing that game a while back because I was cutting back on gaming
28-06-2020T20:07:27,AspiringNoodle,"I take it they still occassionally release a completely OP vehicle and go ""whoops""?"
28-06-2020T20:08:04,Xexanoth,yep
28-06-2020T20:08:19,AspiringNoodle,I remember when I was working for the AMX 50b and they released the T57
28-06-2020T20:08:58,AspiringNoodle,"Took them way too damn long to realize that it completely obsolesced the french tank.  The Frenchy only had a higher top speed, but was worse in every other regard..."
28-06-2020T20:09:25,Xexanoth,"eh, that's still pretty harmless compared to stuff like the 279e"
28-06-2020T20:09:51,Xexanoth,"a sowjet heavy with mobility of a medium, no lower glacias and rounded armor everywhere"
28-06-2020T20:10:07,Xexanoth,"also known as ""throw gold ammo at it and hope it dies"""
28-06-2020T20:12:16,AspiringNoodle,:|
28-06-2020T20:13:32,AspiringNoodle,Guess it's start playing Destiny 2 / FFXIV and/or wait for Shadowlands
28-06-2020T20:13:44,Xexanoth,"on the bright side, it's a reward vehicle for a very hard series of mission, so only the best players in the game actually get it....because those are exactly the kind of people that need overpowered tanks."
28-06-2020T20:14:42,AspiringNoodle,"Well, don't let me get one then, lol"
28-06-2020T20:16:11,Dadrobit,"Man, I used to play a game back in the day called Dust 514. OP weapons were like the norm. If you weren't investing into the OP weapons, you weren't playing the game right."
28-06-2020T20:17:13,Xexanoth,if the weapons are OP enough it's not like you have another option than to invest in them
28-06-2020T20:17:26,Dadrobit,"It was pretty great though. Everything in game you brought into battle was a one time use item, so if you died, you lost everything and had to buy them again."
28-06-2020T20:18:03,Xexanoth,that would've not been a game for me
28-06-2020T20:18:21,Dadrobit,"Suit, modules, weapons, equipment were all one time pieces of gear. So every match you entered required budgeting your overall account."
28-06-2020T20:19:03,Dadrobit,"I loved it. If you were good, you could just go in with super basic gear, die 2-3 times, kill a shitload more than you were worth, and make out like a bandit."
28-06-2020T20:21:56,Dadrobit,It was cross platform with the PC space opera game EVE Online. So in certain circumstances you could link up with a PC player in a ship in orbit over the battlefied and call in an orbital bombardment. Was very fukkin sweet.
28-06-2020T20:22:59,Dadrobit,This game being PS3 fwiw
28-06-2020T20:25:34,Xexanoth,"but the real question is, how much did it costs for the eve player to bombard XD"
28-06-2020T20:26:19,Dadrobit,Not much other than their time. Bombardment ammo wasn't terribly expensive and the ship class used was only the Destroyer tier. So a few million ISK at most.
28-06-2020T20:29:11,Dadrobit,https://i.imgur.com/9oO9DES.png I can afford it
28-06-2020T21:07:01,Twokinds,can I borrow some ISK
28-06-2020T21:07:56,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-adiracoin:
28-06-2020T21:17:15,Dadrobit,"Tbf, that's only worth like $130 real world dollars, but I can throw a couple your way."
28-06-2020T21:18:22,Dadrobit,And most of it is tied up in assets and investments.
28-06-2020T21:31:15,Twokinds,I need about 3.50
28-06-2020T21:35:41,Dadrobit,Best I can do is 2.25 and this cool piece of lint I found in my pocket that kinda looks like John Lennon.
28-06-2020T21:37:45,SpazztasticKiwi,well Iâ€™m lost
