05-02-2020T16:11:03,SpazztasticKiwi,this family next to me‚Äôs getting out of their car to go in the store and the mom is ~fighting~ the little boy to get his coat on
05-02-2020T16:11:31,SpazztasticKiwi,‚Äúcruel and unusual punishment! abuse!‚Äù
05-02-2020T16:12:15,ThingsAreMoving,and when she wins she'll perform parentality
05-02-2020T16:12:24,ThingsAreMoving,"""you're grounded, mister"""
05-02-2020T16:12:25,tehbear,PARENTALITY. MOM. WINS.
05-02-2020T16:13:40,tehbear,kids sometimes get into temper-tantrums ... but parents shouldnt fight their kids
05-02-2020T16:15:31,tehbear,I recall not wanting to learn to tie my shoelaces
05-02-2020T16:15:40,tehbear,aint got time for that
05-02-2020T16:15:46,tehbear,i wanna go outside NOW!

05-02-2020T16:16:52,ThingsAreMoving,my vivid imagination would take care of the rest
05-02-2020T16:17:04,ThingsAreMoving,"I learned how to tie my shoes when I was five, lol"

05-02-2020T16:17:43,tehbear,the terrible 3s?
05-02-2020T16:18:05,tehbear,your parents are scary Things
05-02-2020T16:18:13,ThingsAreMoving,Meh I probably would let him freeze his ass off. He'd ask for the coat when the cold would hit him
05-02-2020T16:19:10,ThingsAreMoving,"When you're 3 you can already tell when you're hungry, thirsty, cold or hot. No need to be overprotective."
05-02-2020T16:19:45,tehbear,^
05-02-2020T16:20:35,SpazztasticKiwi,but if they let him have his way and have no coat
05-02-2020T16:20:46,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúWHY DOES THAT BABY HAVE NO COAT‚Äù
05-02-2020T16:21:08,SpazztasticKiwi,or he‚Äôll learn a tantrum gets his way
05-02-2020T16:21:32,ThingsAreMoving,"nah, he'd ask for the coat and I'd rub it in"
05-02-2020T16:21:47,ThingsAreMoving,"""I thought you didn't want it. you were pretty vocal about it, son."""
05-02-2020T16:23:43,ThingsAreMoving,"gotta teach kids to be responsible for their actions, else we'll have snowflakes who do what they want and get offended whenever something goes wrong"
05-02-2020T16:24:25,tehbear,"eh, they learn the hard way eventually. reality kicks in sooner or later"
05-02-2020T16:25:02,tehbear,the problem is when multiple snowflakes clump together
05-02-2020T16:26:02,ThingsAreMoving,I wish my parents taught me that the world is not a fair place and being good to everyone doesn't mean everyone's going to be good to me.
05-02-2020T16:26:20,ThingsAreMoving,Might've butchered that past tense. Please correct me if I did.
05-02-2020T16:26:35,tehbear,looks fine to me

05-02-2020T16:38:52,tehbear,had a massive snowfall last night. i was using the snowblower for almost an hour to make a path down the road
05-02-2020T16:40:34,tehbear,almost done my back in multiple times shoveling wet snow
05-02-2020T16:40:47,tehbear,so its great to have a machine for it

05-02-2020T16:45:13,CrRAR,lol I remember that in global news
05-02-2020T16:45:27,CrRAR,It was like a national catastrophe
05-02-2020T16:46:15,CrRAR,"That's how the south here is though, a inch or two or so and its the apocalypse"
05-02-2020T16:46:35,ThingsAreMoving,"Yeah, well people over here don't have snow like that and almost nothing can withstand low temp and lots of snowfall"
05-02-2020T16:46:55,ThingsAreMoving,I don't think people in the UK have winter tires
05-02-2020T16:47:16,CrRAR,"I saw one dude in Georgia on the news somehow caught his BMW on fire ""because of the winter weather""."
05-02-2020T16:47:55,ThingsAreMoving,speeding + slippery road + summer tires = destruction derby
05-02-2020T16:52:19,tehbear,think we had about 8 inches of snow or more. bit hard to say as it compresses now that its a few degrees above freezing
05-02-2020T16:53:34,tehbear,"i decided not to bicycle today, and instead had someone drive me"
05-02-2020T16:54:39,tehbear,"surprisingly, people here also risk it and dont always change to winter tires. they are in the minority"
05-02-2020T16:54:58,tehbear,and its a criminal offence to not use them if conditions require
