17-04-2020T13:26:35,Dadrobit,Been out of work for a few weeks and it's actually driven me mad I think.
17-04-2020T13:26:59,Dadrobit,"Doctor is kinda irking me though, not gonna lie."
17-04-2020T13:27:29,CrRAR,Who knew Doctors would get so dodgy during a health crisis.
17-04-2020T13:27:44,Dadrobit,"He refuses to let me return to work, but he's had my FMLA paperwork for nearly a week and hasn't filled them out for me to turn in yet."

17-04-2020T13:30:50,CrimsonQuill,Taken quick peek at video archive.
17-04-2020T13:31:00,CrimsonQuill,I see a Volume 5 cover. This pleases me.
17-04-2020T13:31:34,CrRAR,":ctwokinds-laura:*[I'm back, bby]"
17-04-2020T13:32:10,CrimsonQuill,I remember when I first bought the volumes
17-04-2020T13:32:25,CrimsonQuill,I'd seen that Vol.4 was coming out and had a lovely print of Raine.
17-04-2020T13:32:39,CrimsonQuill,I spent half my money for the last few weeks to get all the books
17-04-2020T13:33:05,CrimsonQuill,"(Excepting 'Art of Twokinds' of course, couldn't afford that 'un)"
17-04-2020T13:33:22,CrimsonQuill,And I look forward to the next in the collection! :)
17-04-2020T13:33:51,CrimsonQuill,(I still have the Print in a frame on my bedside table atm...it's nice to have.)
17-04-2020T13:34:12,Dadrobit,"Yeah, my lungs are still pretty fucked. I get gassed from even trying to do housework. The thought of even an asthma attack at the moment is more than a little scary."
17-04-2020T13:34:39,CrimsonQuill,"@Dadrobit Ouch, in Isolation I assume?"
17-04-2020T13:34:51,CrRAR,Yeah I'd imagine some repairing has to happen
17-04-2020T13:35:09,CrRAR,I mean viruses literally cause destruction of cells
17-04-2020T13:35:11,Dadrobit,"Actually getting another chest related sickness, not even talking covid, would actually just be GG for me."
17-04-2020T13:35:26,CrimsonQuill,"They're horrible to have.,"
17-04-2020T13:35:35,CrimsonQuill,I used to have mild broncilitis.
17-04-2020T13:35:46,CrimsonQuill,My younger sister has full on Asthma.
17-04-2020T13:36:15,Dadrobit,"And yeah, I'm still holding down the proverbial fort at home."
17-04-2020T13:37:03,CrimsonQuill,How long have you been isolating Dadrobit?
17-04-2020T13:38:15,Dadrobit,Nearly a month now.
17-04-2020T13:38:16,IronHorseComics,long enough to have permanent cabin fever
17-04-2020T13:38:53,CrimsonQuill,Youch
17-04-2020T13:38:57,CrimsonQuill,I was out for that long
17-04-2020T13:39:13,CrimsonQuill,But that was partially because I had holidays tacked on to the isolation
17-04-2020T13:39:40,CrimsonQuill,The test result for the person I was in contact with didn't come for two and a half weeks afterwards
17-04-2020T13:41:55,CrimsonQuill,@Dadrobit How hard is it to keep sane for you?
17-04-2020T13:42:15,Dadrobit,Impossible.
17-04-2020T13:43:02,CrimsonQuill,Ouch. Do please Elaborate
17-04-2020T13:43:26,Dadrobit,"I mean, I legit can barely move around my own home."
17-04-2020T13:43:52,Dadrobit,Just trying to distract myself with a mix of news and video games.
17-04-2020T13:44:17,CrimsonQuill,...
17-04-2020T13:44:23,CrimsonQuill,I feel for you
17-04-2020T13:44:29,CrimsonQuill,"To be honest, it was the same for me"
17-04-2020T13:45:55,CrRAR,Did you get that place that got torn up by those tenants rehabbed again?
17-04-2020T13:46:56,Dadrobit,That was a long while back if it's what I think you're referring to?
17-04-2020T13:47:52,Dadrobit,I've not lived in that house regardless no.
17-04-2020T13:48:13,Dadrobit,"I was considering perhaps taking it, but my sister ended up there."
17-04-2020T13:48:23,CrRAR,"ah, cool."
17-04-2020T13:49:08,Dadrobit,Literally right next door. Not the coolest thing in the world all the time.
17-04-2020T13:49:44,Dadrobit,"She's dealing with a bunch of shit at the moment, that lands on my proverbial porch."
17-04-2020T13:50:04,CrRAR,dang ):
17-04-2020T13:50:38,CrRAR,yeah suck to have to be in the middle of that sorta stuff
17-04-2020T13:51:33,CrimsonQuill,Woah.
17-04-2020T13:51:44,Dadrobit,She's not the most respectful person of my time. Liked to come over and just lay her woes on me at all hours. She was very fond of using the hours that I was supposed to be asleep.
17-04-2020T13:53:20,CrimsonQuill,"That... can be very wearing, to make an understatement."
17-04-2020T13:53:31,Dadrobit,More than a little.
17-04-2020T13:53:35,CrRAR,"Sounds like someone I used to work with, she was very eager to vent everything, almost like it was as necessary as breathing."
17-04-2020T13:53:49,Dadrobit,"Yeah, she's always been exactly that."
17-04-2020T13:54:01,CrRAR,"Yeah, they just mostly need an ear to listen."
17-04-2020T13:54:23,CrRAR,Unfortunately for you it was your precious recover time.
17-04-2020T13:54:32,CrimsonQuill,"Well, among us, we all know when to draw the line between 'venting' and 'whining'"
17-04-2020T13:54:49,CrimsonQuill,And whenever we crossover to 'whining' we're told it outright...
17-04-2020T13:54:57,CrRAR,haha
17-04-2020T13:55:19,CrimsonQuill,So have you tried asking your sister to leave you be at night @Dadrobit?
17-04-2020T13:55:35,Dadrobit,More than a few times.
17-04-2020T13:55:46,Dadrobit,Ends with even more sulking
17-04-2020T13:56:23,CrRAR,"Yeah Crimson, if they don't vent they just get more and more anxious with no outlet."
17-04-2020T13:57:01,CrRAR,"but yeah a little inconsiderate being like ""If I can't sleep, you can't sleep"""
17-04-2020T13:57:19,CrimsonQuill,...Sounds like they need help. Quite literally and seriously.
17-04-2020T13:57:37,CrimsonQuill,It might be an underlying symptom
17-04-2020T13:57:50,Dadrobit,Yes. She deals with a lot of mental issues as well.
17-04-2020T13:58:10,CrRAR,Is Oreo still being a scamp?
17-04-2020T13:58:18,Dadrobit,As much as he can.
17-04-2020T13:58:22,CrRAR,haha
17-04-2020T13:58:30,Dadrobit,He's taking a nap in his kennel right now.
17-04-2020T13:58:49,Dadrobit,I can hear him snoring.
17-04-2020T13:58:54,CrimsonQuill,Aww
17-04-2020T13:59:10,CrRAR,"nice, probably surrounded with all his favorite toys"
17-04-2020T14:00:02,CrimsonQuill,"Alright guys, I'm off"
17-04-2020T14:00:10,CrimsonQuill,Going to have a shower and a dvsd

17-04-2020T18:06:21,CrimsonHelsing,"By the... how many of them did Trace store in there, Tom? O.o;"
17-04-2020T18:06:29,Wolfy33,hats up guys
17-04-2020T18:06:31,KeefMcDerpface,Hundreds?

17-04-2020T18:06:50,Ordithus,bye deathclaw
17-04-2020T18:06:57,TeapotOfDoom,have fun deathclaw!
17-04-2020T18:07:02,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,"Bye Tom, Sage, and Nekonny, and ord, and everybody"
17-04-2020T18:07:08,BadFoMo,Bye.
17-04-2020T18:07:11,SageSaga,stay safe!
17-04-2020T18:07:13,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,Thanks for strimming
17-04-2020T18:07:33,Rosscoe,Bye TFD!
17-04-2020T18:07:41,Wolfy33,bye
17-04-2020T18:08:57,SageSaga,hmm what happened to my effects brushes
17-04-2020T18:09:07,Ordithus,did you misplace them
17-04-2020T18:09:31,KeefMcDerpface,Is Nibbs stealing brushes now?
17-04-2020T18:09:32,SageSaga,i dunno- they arent on here- maybe after i installed them clip may have closed without saving them
17-04-2020T18:10:06,Rosscoe,Latest Clip patch is a tad wonky. Even I had to re-install a couple of brush's
17-04-2020T18:10:14,steelabjur,"Nibbs, sitting on a pile of brushes: ""Sythe WILL be mine now!"""
17-04-2020T18:11:16,Ordithus,"Red, I know every kid has played with an umbrella like it's a sword, but..."
17-04-2020T18:11:34,KeefMcDerpface,He thinks it's a magic spear.
17-04-2020T18:13:14,Mediawatcher,A stone lizard army! Oh no!
17-04-2020T18:13:25,Mediawatcher,They are screwed!
17-04-2020T18:13:40,Ordithus,"yep, comic is all Kat, Zen, and Maddie now"
17-04-2020T18:13:45,Ordithus,everyone else ded
17-04-2020T18:13:55,KeefMcDerpface,"What's worse, they are all sale persons."
17-04-2020T18:14:02,Mediawatcher,Dang Tom killing off so many long lasting characters rip
17-04-2020T18:14:29,steelabjur,Stone Dragonmen. Only Stoneward is a lizard (and made with Nora's help).
17-04-2020T18:15:15,MuonNeutrino,"yup, these are presumably the 'other' attempts that trace made on his own before asking nora for helpo"
17-04-2020T18:15:56,Rosscoe,Sounds like something out of a Monty Python movie
17-04-2020T18:16:11,steelabjur,Which explains their condition.
17-04-2020T18:17:37,Mediawatcher,"Thanks a lot trace, now you’ve killed nearly the entire cast"
17-04-2020T18:18:03,CrimsonHelsing,@Mediawatcher relax
17-04-2020T18:18:09,CrimsonHelsing,they're not gonna die
17-04-2020T18:18:11,Mediawatcher,Trace truly is a monster
17-04-2020T18:18:20,KeefMcDerpface,...Yet.
17-04-2020T18:18:22,CrimsonHelsing,"old trace is, not the new trace"
17-04-2020T18:18:28,falangie123,hello all
17-04-2020T18:18:33,Rosscoe,o/
17-04-2020T18:18:34,KeefMcDerpface,Hello
17-04-2020T18:18:41,CrimsonHelsing,hey falangie
17-04-2020T18:18:52,Rosscoe,@Sage making a new chapter cover?
17-04-2020T18:18:53,Mediawatcher,Tom going full walking dead on us
17-04-2020T18:18:59,Mediawatcher,🤣
17-04-2020T18:19:05,SageSaga,yep- new chapter starts Wednesday
17-04-2020T18:19:10,CrimsonHelsing,"looks pretty badass, don't it?"
17-04-2020T18:19:11,Ordithus,It's looking gooood
17-04-2020T18:19:21,Rosscoe,\o/
17-04-2020T18:19:21,Nekonny,yup!
17-04-2020T18:19:36,Ordithus,"And same to you, Ron"
17-04-2020T18:20:02,Rosscoe,@Nekonny whatever is going on :ptv-shipit:
17-04-2020T18:20:11,Mediawatcher,Trace going full kill everyone on us
17-04-2020T18:20:41,CrimsonHelsing,"Trace isn't even doing this! This is the estate doing it itself, acting on old Trace's orders. New Trace is not to blame for this"
17-04-2020T18:20:56,CrimsonHelsing,"he doesn't even know about this, but he can stop it"
17-04-2020T18:21:03,TeapotOfDoom,trace should still have control
17-04-2020T18:21:12,CrimsonHelsing,And again *no one is going to die*
17-04-2020T18:21:14,TeapotOfDoom,at least some resemlence of it
17-04-2020T18:21:22,Mediawatcher,Maybe he can order them to stop if he gets there in time
17-04-2020T18:21:47,TeapotOfDoom,not before they perform at least one song
17-04-2020T18:21:51,SageSaga,when i tell my robots to kill anyone who enters the room- they kill anyone who enters the room even if i dont want them to at the moment
17-04-2020T18:22:02,CrimsonHelsing,lol! Good one Teapot xD
17-04-2020T18:22:09,Ordithus,":ctwokinds-rose:*[They're mine now, hon]"
17-04-2020T18:22:27,RimaDraws,>>
17-04-2020T18:22:39,TeapotOfDoom,plot twist. rose is the bad one here
17-04-2020T18:22:47,KeefMcDerpface,"Hmm, a thought came to mind, what type of theme would be playing for these guys if this were a game or movie, etc."
17-04-2020T18:22:57,Mediawatcher,What if you are there telling them to stop at the moment sage?
17-04-2020T18:23:11,CrimsonHelsing,"I'm rather wary of that, Teapot, ngl"
17-04-2020T18:23:12,SageSaga,robots are usually faster than me
17-04-2020T18:23:27,CrimsonHelsing,but I'm gonna hold my breath on that one
17-04-2020T18:23:28,Mediawatcher,Maybe rose was the one talking in the table
17-04-2020T18:23:32,TeapotOfDoom,but trace should be able to teleport
17-04-2020T18:23:48,SageSaga,since when?
17-04-2020T18:23:48,IronHorseComics,"whoa, wait a minuts"
17-04-2020T18:23:52,IronHorseComics,*minute
17-04-2020T18:24:02,CrimsonHelsing,"if he can think to, or if he can get his bearings in time, but first he needs to find out wtf is going on"
17-04-2020T18:24:09,CrimsonHelsing,and who tried to drag him there
17-04-2020T18:24:10,TeapotOfDoom,well he teleported just a few pages ago
17-04-2020T18:24:19,TeapotOfDoom,so he was able to do that at some point
17-04-2020T18:24:20,SageSaga,he didnt have any control over that obviously
17-04-2020T18:24:21,Ordithus,:robot:*[1.8 kilo-killz per second]
17-04-2020T18:24:22,CrimsonHelsing,that wasn't him doing it himself
17-04-2020T18:24:27,Mediawatcher,I can’t believe trace is going gp full thanos and wipe out everyone on that beach
17-04-2020T18:24:29,Rosscoe,"Sage, you have a ABC Warrior from Judge Dredd standing gaurd dont yea lol?"
17-04-2020T18:24:32,CrimsonHelsing,"it was someone else kidnapping him, Teapot"
17-04-2020T18:24:38,IronHorseComics,Don't think I didn't see that evil face in the smoke Tom
17-04-2020T18:24:46,Mediawatcher,"Now there will only be zen, flora, kat and trace from now on, thanks a lot trace"
17-04-2020T18:24:47,TeapotOfDoom,if he suddenly remembered basitin i'm not ruling that one out straight away
17-04-2020T18:25:00,CrimsonHelsing,"Mediawatcher, chill"
17-04-2020T18:25:15,falangie123,i think rose is definitely either crazy or evil
17-04-2020T18:25:18,CrimsonHelsing,"and again, these things are acting on orders from *old* Trace"
17-04-2020T18:25:25,Mediawatcher,Seriously though those stone guardians are cool
17-04-2020T18:25:31,CrimsonHelsing,ikr?
17-04-2020T18:25:49,Mediawatcher,Now if only they were on the good guys side and not trace
17-04-2020T18:25:54,CrimsonHelsing,I'd love a Doom mod that replaces some of the demons with them
17-04-2020T18:26:06,CrimsonHelsing,"current Trace is the good guy, Media"
17-04-2020T18:26:22,KeefMcDerpface,brb
17-04-2020T18:26:24,TheSexyBeast,"Old Trace set the traps, new Trace unwittingly took his friends and himself into the mansion"
17-04-2020T18:26:26,TeapotOfDoom,rose turning on them would be a rather harsh twist tho
17-04-2020T18:26:37,CrimsonHelsing,and heartbreaking
17-04-2020T18:26:38,TeapotOfDoom,because she was so amused at trace beofre
17-04-2020T18:26:40,IronHorseComics,and one that I personally don't wanna see
17-04-2020T18:26:58,TeapotOfDoom,^
17-04-2020T18:26:59,Mediawatcher,I really hope rose isn’t the bad guy this chapter
17-04-2020T18:27:06,falangie123,true but a bit of tragedy never hurt any story
17-04-2020T18:27:15,IronHorseComics,we had tragedy already
17-04-2020T18:27:36,TheSexyBeast,LOTS of tragedy!
17-04-2020T18:27:36,CrimsonHelsing,and she seemed to notice Trace was a different man than the monster she knew before
17-04-2020T18:27:38,Mediawatcher,Besides trace already fits the bad guy role this chapter
17-04-2020T18:27:39,IronHorseComics,"Keith's friend died, Laura died, and Maeve almost died"
17-04-2020T18:27:45,TeapotOfDoom,i think she would have her conflict with SAVING him but i don't thnk she would be straight up counter him
17-04-2020T18:27:49,CrimsonHelsing,*old* Trace!
17-04-2020T18:28:01,Mediawatcher,"Oh so now Karen’s swimsuit is purple, she just can’t choose a color"
17-04-2020T18:28:08,CrimsonHelsing,evil Trace! not good Trace
17-04-2020T18:28:24,Ordithus,Purple is a good color on her
17-04-2020T18:28:41,MuonNeutrino,"so tom, regarding that most recent sketch, just how tall *IS* brutus anyway? boi is HUGE O.o"
17-04-2020T18:28:42,TheSexyBeast,"I'm with you, CH"
17-04-2020T18:28:48,Mediawatcher,"In honor of her sister, victim of traces wrath"
17-04-2020T18:28:58,CrimsonHelsing,"evil Trace, Media, please"
17-04-2020T18:29:16,CrimsonHelsing,and that's not gonna happen
17-04-2020T18:29:31,TeapotOfDoom,we still need a good morning reference sheet
17-04-2020T18:29:41,Mediawatcher,Well there is nora
17-04-2020T18:30:10,KeefMcDerpface,back
17-04-2020T18:30:12,steelabjur,"Red: ""We hunt the great stone dragon!"""
17-04-2020T18:30:27,TheSexyBeast,Nora is the Deus ex Machina character
17-04-2020T18:31:05,johnnytho,Back from my run
17-04-2020T18:31:10,KeefMcDerpface,wb
17-04-2020T18:31:37,Ordithus,wb johnny
17-04-2020T18:31:49,Mediawatcher,They’re confrontations with trace isn’t gonna be pretty
17-04-2020T18:31:51,TheSexyBeast,WB
17-04-2020T18:32:03,Mediawatcher,Their confrontation with trace isn’t gonna be pretty
17-04-2020T18:32:05,Twokinds,Nora is completely OP
17-04-2020T18:32:13,CrimsonHelsing,"she is, really"
17-04-2020T18:32:13,Mediawatcher,What about reni?
17-04-2020T18:32:17,Ordithus,[In bed]*:ctwokinds-NoraEyebrows:
17-04-2020T18:32:17,TeapotOfDoom,Nora op pls nerf
17-04-2020T18:32:27,Twokinds,It's why she was sidelined in all but the side comics
17-04-2020T18:32:31,Mediawatcher,She needs a patch
17-04-2020T18:32:51,Mediawatcher,To make her less op
17-04-2020T18:32:57,TeapotOfDoom,Instant deus ex machina
17-04-2020T18:33:00,Twokinds,"And in her place is Reni, a young dragon untrained in magic."
17-04-2020T18:33:18,TeapotOfDoom,pretty nice move to be honest
17-04-2020T18:33:22,falangie123,nora loves chains because she's so powerful
17-04-2020T18:33:29,TeapotOfDoom,*Outstanding move*
17-04-2020T18:33:30,TheSexyBeast,"Makes perfect sense, Tom"
17-04-2020T18:33:39,BadFoMo,I'm fine with this swap.
17-04-2020T18:33:45,Mediawatcher,I imagine reni will still be pretty valuable ally in all this
17-04-2020T18:33:59,Twokinds,"Oh yeah, she's still a giant lizard"
17-04-2020T18:34:03,Ordithus,she smashed Brutus pretty well
17-04-2020T18:34:06,Zakuru,she got fangs!
17-04-2020T18:34:10,Zakuru,and... fire breath i assume
17-04-2020T18:34:20,TeapotOfDoom,say tom was nora a white or a silber dragon? (if that even applies here)
17-04-2020T18:34:31,TeapotOfDoom,because you talked about reni being a black one
17-04-2020T18:34:33,Twokinds,White
17-04-2020T18:34:34,IronHorseComics,a giant lizard with a human feti- uh... crush...
17-04-2020T18:34:35,Mediawatcher,I’m sure she’ll wreck those store stone army
17-04-2020T18:34:45,Ordithus,They aren't really dnd dragons
17-04-2020T18:35:04,TeapotOfDoom,so cold breath
17-04-2020T18:35:05,Mediawatcher,I’m sure she’ll wreck the stone army
17-04-2020T18:35:06,TeapotOfDoom,nice
17-04-2020T18:35:11,CrimsonHelsing,she absolutely will
17-04-2020T18:35:14,Nekonny,"ok, now for clothes"
17-04-2020T18:35:29,Ordithus,noooooooo
17-04-2020T18:35:35,TeapotOfDoom,i figured wanted to ask nontheless

17-04-2020T18:37:14,Mediawatcher,The only question I have now is where is sythe and maren?
17-04-2020T18:37:21,TeapotOfDoom,gone
17-04-2020T18:37:24,TeapotOfDoom,3rd floor
17-04-2020T18:37:27,Ordithus,Sythe is still probably in his room
17-04-2020T18:37:40,Oxdarock,Chalo's stream freeze?
17-04-2020T18:37:45,TeapotOfDoom,unless he managed to grab maren before the teleport

17-04-2020T18:38:11,Mediawatcher,"That’s what I suspect happened, he probably grabbed on to a rest arm /before she disappeared"

17-04-2020T18:38:21,BadFoMo,@Oxdarock It's been frozen for me for a while now.
17-04-2020T18:38:26,TeapotOfDoom,she will need him i figure
17-04-2020T18:38:29,Ordithus,"Chalo's stream has been spotty for me, but seems to be sort of working for me"
17-04-2020T18:38:36,Mediawatcher,He probably grabbed on to marens arm before she disappeared
17-04-2020T18:39:19,Mediawatcher,Anyone else here love the appropriate music for this page?
17-04-2020T18:39:39,MuonNeutrino,"in the comic where she started being teleported, it's hard to tell for sure but it looks like he might not have been within arm's reach"
17-04-2020T18:39:42,BadFoMo,"Also, Sythe grabed Maren as she was being taken. That messed up the teleporting and now they are one."
17-04-2020T18:39:47,MuonNeutrino,but it's hard to tell

17-04-2020T20:21:55,SpazztasticKiwi,work
17-04-2020T20:22:08,SpazztasticKiwi,because everythings being opened up
17-04-2020T20:22:20,SpazztasticKiwi,and people are brain deficient
17-04-2020T20:22:47,Ordithus,"yikes.  I see... are they being supplied?  Every grocery worker here has has them now (cloth masks, mostly)"
17-04-2020T20:23:35,SpazztasticKiwi,"you can bring if not make your own but if that’s not possible, you must contact management"
17-04-2020T20:24:08,SpazztasticKiwi,"this will be policy when it drops, so getting everyone one will be as mandatory as wearing it"

17-04-2020T20:27:46,SpazztasticKiwi,"just recently, he was off to the side on it again and this time I directly said “get off your phone”"
17-04-2020T20:28:29,SpazztasticKiwi,a moment later I come back out from the sink area myself with supplies to clean the grease drips on the fryer like the manager said to yesterday and he’s disappeared
17-04-2020T20:29:04,SpazztasticKiwi,he had to have snuck off to text more out of my sight
17-04-2020T20:29:21,GoldNightCat,hmm
17-04-2020T20:29:44,SpazztasticKiwi,"$10, he’s on it again when I walk back in from break in a minute"

17-04-2020T20:31:14,SpazztasticKiwi,responsibility feels alot like stress
17-04-2020T20:31:36,Ordithus,that means you care <3
17-04-2020T20:32:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"no, he’s just got stuff to be doing and I’m not doing it or getting blames for it or him not doing it"
17-04-2020T20:32:39,SpazztasticKiwi,and I’m most definitely not going to be gotten on to for not explaining or reminding him of anything
17-04-2020T20:33:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"the first night he closed, I got everything but the bone basics done before I left, staying over my time"
17-04-2020T20:34:14,SpazztasticKiwi,wrote out a list of everything that needed to be done and went over that and what had been done more than TWICE before walking out
17-04-2020T20:34:20,SpazztasticKiwi,in front of the cameras
17-04-2020T20:34:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I learn later he left the bottom of the hot case chills and claimed I hadn’t explained or even mentioned the list
17-04-2020T20:34:46,SpazztasticKiwi,even said he hadn’t even noticed it
17-04-2020T20:36:10,SpazztasticKiwi,"next time I closed with him, I did the same, but this time, I outright said “I’m gonna wrote this out and explain it before I leave in front of the cameras cause apparently I didn’t last time and I’m not going to hear that again”"
17-04-2020T20:37:19,SpazztasticKiwi,"I didn’t get in trouble for anything, and theses claims he had was told to be by one of the girls that was working with me that night who’d heard this the day before when they asked him about what he’d left"
17-04-2020T20:38:37,Ordithus,:ptv-right::wine_glass:
17-04-2020T20:38:43,SpazztasticKiwi,but I knew that I could get in trouble if he did miss something eventually if any of us missed something to explain to him because that’s training (fully understandable)
17-04-2020T20:39:00,Ordithus,or :icecream::ptv-left:
17-04-2020T20:39:20,SpazztasticKiwi,so I did that to sort of low key let him know I’d heard and let him know I was covering my ass
17-04-2020T20:39:27,ThoseButterflys,or
17-04-2020T20:39:49,SpazztasticKiwi,but breaks over and I still got a bit to do
17-04-2020T20:40:08,Ordithus,"alright, peace, try not to get too stressed"
17-04-2020T20:40:08,SpazztasticKiwi,only 30 left but that’s if I get said things done in 30

17-04-2020T20:56:05,Nekonny,heya tharks!
17-04-2020T20:56:14,Nekonny,Ive played so little though
17-04-2020T20:56:18,BlackjackSec99,gunlock is semi homebrew warlock that casts with pistols or rifles
17-04-2020T20:56:26,Nekonny,and been a decade since at least
17-04-2020T20:56:56,BlackjackSec99,"not much has changed, still as fun as ever as long as youve got a good group and good DM"
17-04-2020T20:57:56,Ordithus,"I only started a couple years ago, only on my second campaign ever, really"
17-04-2020T20:58:02,Ordithus,and the first isn't even done
17-04-2020T20:58:35,Rosscoe,Yay Nekonny is back!
17-04-2020T20:59:02,BlackjackSec99,"lol im still on my first myself, weve been going for about a year and a half now."
17-04-2020T20:59:48,BlackjackSec99,I got in in the first session of this campaign so there wasent much awkwardness of trying to adjust to an existing game
17-04-2020T21:00:32,Ordithus,:ptv-sad: the bobs have been covered
17-04-2020T21:00:37,BlackjackSec99,im level 8 currently
17-04-2020T21:00:44,BlackjackSec99,they have been :(

17-04-2020T21:01:04,Nekonny,hahaha ord XD
17-04-2020T21:01:18,Nekonny,I'm thinkling I should have a base skin layer
17-04-2020T21:01:22,Rosscoe,"This is a SFW Nekonny stream, of course they are gona get covered XD"
17-04-2020T21:01:28,Nekonny,then do the clothes over that
17-04-2020T21:01:36,Nekonny,otherwise therell be a lot of work
17-04-2020T21:01:41,Ordithus,intriguing
17-04-2020T21:02:02,BlackjackSec99,"good way to do it. get all the shapes right, then build the clothes over them so they look right"
17-04-2020T21:02:17,Rosscoe,I know many who do it that way
17-04-2020T21:03:08,Rosscoe,I myself do it that way
17-04-2020T21:03:13,Ordithus,yeah Sage emphasizes drawing em nekkid then putting clothes on
17-04-2020T21:03:42,BlackjackSec99,"it is the way I shal do it, whenever I get good enough to draw bobs in the first place :/"
17-04-2020T21:04:15,Nekonny,"yeah, I think I'll do that"
17-04-2020T21:04:30,Nekonny,"once I ink the outfits, I'll paint a base skin layer"
17-04-2020T21:04:43,Nekonny,is it still considered sfw with no bits showing tho?
17-04-2020T21:05:01,Ordithus,*shrug* I won't call you out

17-04-2020T21:05:32,Rosscoe,Course depends on the country
17-04-2020T21:06:19,Ordithus,"and that is how sage does it, and he only does ""sfw"""
17-04-2020T21:06:37,Ordithus,"well, not the coloring of skin part"
17-04-2020T21:06:39,Ordithus,hehe

17-04-2020T21:09:52,Ordithus,"to not lead you astray, sage initially sketches with the char's body shape ""nude"" then add clothing on top, then does the rest (ink, yada yada)"
17-04-2020T21:10:02,Rosscoe,Ron AKA Nekonny been doing this for over a week now?

17-04-2020T21:29:16,Rosscoe,@Nekonny So are you phasing out N-chans strips?
17-04-2020T21:32:28,Rosscoe,By stripes I mean the body stripes. Looking at recent art and just noticed that as I'm looking to add N-Chan to a piece I been working on
17-04-2020T21:33:27,Watsup,Might have just forgot them
17-04-2020T21:33:37,Watsup,Nekonny's been working on improving their art in other ways
17-04-2020T21:33:51,Watsup,hence the wat challenges :V
17-04-2020T21:33:58,Tharkis,headpats and earrubs
17-04-2020T21:34:13,Rosscoe,Ok
17-04-2020T21:34:24,Rosscoe,"head pats Tharkis with one hand, ear rubs with the other"
17-04-2020T21:34:32,Nekonny,"yeah, Ive dropped the stripes save for the tail and ears"
17-04-2020T21:34:35,Rosscoe,Hoi Watsup!
17-04-2020T21:35:34,Rosscoe,"Ok, just making sure before I go and add some. Keep's to current trend."
17-04-2020T21:37:08,SandTori,I love Yuki's expression. ♥
17-04-2020T21:37:51,Rosscoe,"So Watsup, how many challanges have you lined up for Nekonny?"
17-04-2020T21:38:22,Watsup,"I sent them a bunch, they can ask for more if they run out or don't like the other ones :V"
17-04-2020T21:38:24,Nekonny,Every so often
17-04-2020T21:38:29,Nekonny,"I don't do all of them,"
17-04-2020T21:38:39,Nekonny,but I'll pick a few that I think I can handle
17-04-2020T21:38:46,Nekonny,and wat guides me though them
17-04-2020T21:40:03,Rosscoe,Ah noice.

17-04-2020T21:42:45,Watsup,If Neko would go lewder he'd get much better challenges! :P
17-04-2020T21:44:52,Watsup,but we'll have to settle for the occasion artistic nude
17-04-2020T21:45:46,BlackjackSec99,"oh, Neko! Mihari posted that drawing you did for her, that was cute!"
17-04-2020T21:46:26,K3IDRAN,I iolled Church by Accident with Tank once

17-04-2020T21:48:39,Matthew250,But it's the tastefule kind.
17-04-2020T21:48:43,Matthew250,*tasteful
17-04-2020T21:48:49,Rosscoe,"Just a skin base, nothing more"

17-04-2020T21:48:54,Ordithus,it's the era touch
17-04-2020T21:48:57,Ordithus,*ear
17-04-2020T21:49:11,Watsup,I think he's planning on clothes
17-04-2020T21:49:18,BlackjackSec99,NOT THE EARS
17-04-2020T21:49:23,Watsup,"might be wrong, he's done artistic nudes before!"
17-04-2020T21:49:36,Rosscoe,"There are cloths made, just not colored yet"
17-04-2020T21:49:54,Ordithus,he's trying out doing a skin base layer for the clothes to go on top of
17-04-2020T21:50:08,Ordithus,It's almost like... we're all naked under our clothes :ptv-shock:
17-04-2020T21:50:25,K3IDRAN,Bruh
17-04-2020T21:51:37,Rosscoe,"Besides face's being something I am still trying to grasp, lighting the surfaces of skin and object's is also a major pain in my back side"
17-04-2020T21:52:18,Tharkis,"lol, with the 'hard edge' highlights"
17-04-2020T21:52:27,Tharkis,nekonny looks like they're made out of rubber or plastic =d
17-04-2020T21:52:47,BlackjackSec99,lots of smoothing lol
17-04-2020T21:53:08,Rosscoe,"Issue I'm haven, is the lighting direction"

17-04-2020T22:09:36,AspiringNoodle,Work at a gas station and corporate is slowly chipping away at the store's hours
17-04-2020T22:09:54,AspiringNoodle,"We lose 2 overall hours this week, another 7 next week"
17-04-2020T22:09:55,Rosscoe,Managers an & assistant mangers get priorty sadly
17-04-2020T22:10:26,AspiringNoodle,I'ts only a matter of time before shifts are barely staffed and corporate will still be breathing down our necks for those precious lists to get done.
17-04-2020T22:10:51,AspiringNoodle,"Btw, Ron, love this shading technique~"
17-04-2020T22:10:58,AspiringNoodle,The softness is so soft :ptv-excited:
