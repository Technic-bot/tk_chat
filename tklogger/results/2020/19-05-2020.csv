19-05-2020T21:27:22,SpazztasticKiwi,sounds a bit more like a chihuahua yodeling or a turkey gargling listerine
19-05-2020T21:34:28,Dadrobit,This was her after she calmed down a bit. Her first screams were fucking horriffying as she was a bit further back behind my gate into the canyon. She had moved up in front of my gate at that time and was actually standing just by the intersection there.
