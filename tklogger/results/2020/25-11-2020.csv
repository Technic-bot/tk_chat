25-11-2020T00:03:00,CrRAR,So if you’re feeling humbug spend part of the day on one and another on the other xD

25-11-2020T00:03:50,CrRAR,“Aaaand it’s tomorrow!”
25-11-2020T00:05:24,Ordithus,"if you gave up either thanksgiving eve or the day after thanksgiving, you could have 48 hours of thanksgiving"

25-11-2020T00:16:52,Dadrobit,I'm yoinking some of the popcorn and one of the salted caramel squares for myself.
25-11-2020T00:16:55,CrRAR,Wow that is substantial amounts of chocolate
25-11-2020T00:17:35,CrRAR,"nice, ghiradelli chocolate popcorn?"
25-11-2020T00:18:10,Dadrobit,It's actually not a ton. It's mostly air. Big boxes with only a little single individually wrapped piece of chocolate.
25-11-2020T00:18:38,CrRAR,Ah dang padding even gifts these days ;_;
25-11-2020T00:18:45,Dadrobit,Ghirardelli is ripping people off tbh.
25-11-2020T00:18:56,Dadrobit,And I can't imagine it was cheap.
25-11-2020T00:19:15,CrRAR,Yeah that’s not fair for an intended gift
25-11-2020T00:19:45,CrRAR,It’s be like if half an edible arangement was imitation/wax fruit pieces xD
25-11-2020T00:20:13,Ordithus,haha
25-11-2020T00:20:14,Dadrobit,"I'm not blaming the resident mind you, I love this particular family for the most part!"
25-11-2020T00:20:26,CrRAR,Yeah no not them
25-11-2020T00:20:39,CrRAR,It is a exceptionally nice gesture!
25-11-2020T00:21:12,Dadrobit,And I'm sure they don't give a single damn how much it cost them. They own like 5 mansions back here.

25-11-2020T00:28:42,Ordithus,we discussed 48 hour thanksgiving
25-11-2020T00:28:58,SpazztasticKiwi,why stop at 48 hours
25-11-2020T00:29:13,Ordithus,the international date line has its limits
25-11-2020T00:29:20,SpazztasticKiwi,week long cookathon

25-11-2020T00:34:11,CrRAR,There’s probably just more food in the afterlife
25-11-2020T00:35:22,SpazztasticKiwi,all the failed meals die and go to heaven
25-11-2020T00:35:28,SpazztasticKiwi,in their perfect form

25-11-2020T03:11:05,SpazztasticKiwi,two more libra candles
25-11-2020T03:11:11,SpazztasticKiwi,they smells nice
25-11-2020T03:11:45,SpazztasticKiwi,...I was distracted but I’m here now
25-11-2020T03:17:37,Twokinds,Man I'm having such a difficult time with this Twokinds dating sim sketch suggestion. I'm a little stumped on how to present it.
25-11-2020T03:18:07,CrRAR,nice
25-11-2020T03:18:52,SpazztasticKiwi,oh and I got a snowflake bath bomb
25-11-2020T03:19:07,SpazztasticKiwi,I think it’s supposed to be some sort of winter berry smell
25-11-2020T03:19:15,CrRAR,Yeah mostly cuz it's based on a q/a
25-11-2020T03:19:44,SpazztasticKiwi,I got the candles for the good smellies but also the candles have necklaces while the libra bath bomb has a ring inside
25-11-2020T03:20:16,CrRAR,ah
25-11-2020T03:20:28,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m taking the pendant off the necklace chain for one of them & making them into earrings so I can have a ring/earrings/necklace set of the constellation
25-11-2020T03:20:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom did you see my idea on that sim a few days ago
25-11-2020T03:21:26,CrRAR,Yeah I feel like for the sim thing just capturing personality is the priority
25-11-2020T03:21:58,SpazztasticKiwi,did you have an epiphany for what you plan to do & now you don’t know how to caption or present it to the adoring public?
25-11-2020T03:23:01,SpazztasticKiwi,the personality thing probably would work best - if I had to guess they’re wanting something like those stereotypical cringey sims you get ads for
25-11-2020T03:23:49,SpazztasticKiwi,crrar with the amount of times I see you blink in and out it’s like you have notifications whenever there’s a new message
25-11-2020T03:24:01,Twokinds,I don't know those
25-11-2020T03:24:08,SpazztasticKiwi,or the attention span of a teaspoon
25-11-2020T03:24:19,CrRAR,:tada:
25-11-2020T03:24:40,SpazztasticKiwi,to be honest I don’t know them well either but if you google dating sim you’ll see a nice sample pallet
25-11-2020T03:27:19,SpazztasticKiwi,"the only sim I have “experience” with is hunnie pop, and you’ll be asking Mark about the design of that game because I’m not going there"
25-11-2020T03:28:06,SpazztasticKiwi,or that furry dating sim he was mashed up with Seán in
25-11-2020T03:28:08,SpazztasticKiwi,that
25-11-2020T03:28:14,SpazztasticKiwi,that was nightmarish
25-11-2020T03:28:22,CrRAR,*conversing with Flora*

25-11-2020T03:30:38,CrRAR,Kou somehow would have to garner a mutual apptrciation of Eric stalking

25-11-2020T03:39:23,CrRAR,*YOU WIN*
25-11-2020T03:40:09,SpazztasticKiwi,oh and then there was that kfc dating sim Seán played
25-11-2020T03:40:23,SpazztasticKiwi,that’s probably mild enough to use as a reference
25-11-2020T03:41:58,CrRAR,Trying to win over the colonel?
25-11-2020T03:42:39,WINDOWS98SE,"If it's the multiple characters in the scene causing issue, maybe have one of them ask the player who they would like to go on a date with?"
25-11-2020T03:42:47,WINDOWS98SE,"Player has the choice of selecting: Kat, Laura, Flora, All Three."
25-11-2020T03:44:45,SpazztasticKiwi,yep trying to win over the colonel
25-11-2020T03:45:08,CrRAR,That takes A LOT of herbs and spices
25-11-2020T03:45:45,CrRAR,“All three”
25-11-2020T03:45:48,CrRAR,>Laura nervously ditches leavIng behind the potato sack

25-11-2020T03:51:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom do you want pictures
25-11-2020T04:02:22,CrRAR,"ooo, maybe the snowflake candle is supposed to be like sugarplums or something"
25-11-2020T04:02:52,CrRAR,Are all these candles an unlabeled mystery till you burn them?
25-11-2020T04:03:29,SpazztasticKiwi,nah the candles are labeled
25-11-2020T04:03:50,SpazztasticKiwi,that time I got a mystery one was from a gift email
25-11-2020T04:04:15,SpazztasticKiwi,that was the only time I got one that was unlabeled - but I found out what it was when I opened the box
25-11-2020T04:04:21,CrRAR,Ah
25-11-2020T04:05:35,SpazztasticKiwi,this is the snowflake one - a bath bomb https://www.fragrantjewels.com/products/one-of-a-kind-bath-bomb
25-11-2020T04:06:17,SpazztasticKiwi,they gave me a free necklace with my order that’s gonna match the blue crystal snowflakes
25-11-2020T04:07:27,SpazztasticKiwi,and this is the candles I got 2 more of https://www.fragrantjewels.com/products/libra-zodiac-collection-jewel-candle
25-11-2020T04:09:48,CrRAR,"Ah, nice both those seem like they would have delicate scents"

25-11-2020T04:11:44,CrRAR,:v: sesa!
25-11-2020T04:15:43,SpazztasticKiwi,the candles smell like peach and pear
25-11-2020T04:16:21,CrRAR,yah I saw that one
25-11-2020T04:16:21,SpazztasticKiwi,"from the ones I’ve sampled so far, it’s my favorite combo they have"
25-11-2020T04:16:51,CrRAR,Yeah I feel like pears mellow out peaches
25-11-2020T04:17:21,CrRAR,Almost like a peachy honeydew type smell probably?
25-11-2020T04:17:47,SpazztasticKiwi,a little
25-11-2020T04:18:11,SpazztasticKiwi,the site is having 7 days of black friday so they were on sale yesterday
25-11-2020T04:18:37,SpazztasticKiwi,figured I’d snap em up while I could for cheaper to try my idea

25-11-2020T04:21:40,SpazztasticKiwi,taking the pendants off the necklace chain and making earrings

25-11-2020T04:21:49,CrRAR,Ohhh
25-11-2020T04:21:55,CrRAR,neat
25-11-2020T04:22:20,SpazztasticKiwi,the only problem and why I almost got 3 is there’s two versions of the necklace and the one I have is the one I wanted
25-11-2020T04:22:51,SpazztasticKiwi,but either of these new ones could have the blue stone option..which won’t match the opal option I have
25-11-2020T04:23:12,CrRAR,Ah
25-11-2020T04:23:19,SpazztasticKiwi,but the same goes for the ring - I haven’t used it to see which version of the ring I’m getting
25-11-2020T04:23:31,SpazztasticKiwi,you know most people don’t care about this stuff
25-11-2020T04:24:28,CrRAR,"nope, but you can use the candles anyway so it’s something to do"
25-11-2020T04:25:35,CrRAR,Mixing and matching the stuff is neat
25-11-2020T04:25:43,SpazztasticKiwi,the smell lingers better than most perfumes
25-11-2020T04:25:59,CrRAR,:ike inventing a whole new thing tat doesn’t exist
25-11-2020T04:26:07,CrRAR,*like

25-11-2020T04:28:07,SpazztasticKiwi,I aimed to go two hours ago or so
25-11-2020T04:28:14,SpazztasticKiwi,that ended well
25-11-2020T04:28:50,CrRAR,Yeahhh I declared sleeptime too awhile ago
25-11-2020T04:28:59,CrRAR,n o p e
25-11-2020T04:30:50,CrRAR,We could ask tom
25-11-2020T04:30:57,CrRAR,"Oh great Tom, shall we sleep yet?"
25-11-2020T04:31:00,SpazztasticKiwi,it goes from five more minutes to I’ll get to it eventually
25-11-2020T04:31:21,SpazztasticKiwi,there’s cooking tomorrow
25-11-2020T04:31:39,CrRAR,Got anything lined up?
25-11-2020T04:32:07,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m surprised Tom’s up - he’s usually clocking out and doing whatever he does when he’s not stalking us at about this time
25-11-2020T04:32:17,SpazztasticKiwi,which I figure is bed
25-11-2020T04:32:32,CrRAR,Creativity might have struck
25-11-2020T04:32:49,SpazztasticKiwi,"green bean casserole, stuffing, turkey, pie"

25-11-2020T15:08:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I asked what the suggestion was wanting
25-11-2020T15:09:40,SpazztasticKiwi,otherwise I’d given an idea for it besides vague concepts
25-11-2020T15:12:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I was imagining something where the three where grouped together as one character unit
25-11-2020T15:13:42,SpazztasticKiwi,the mockup looks like the usual beginning a sim might have - characters in a sim have 2-3 different poses with the text lines they do in the game
25-11-2020T15:14:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"blushing, sad/mad, and their default pose, maybe more"
25-11-2020T15:14:58,SpazztasticKiwi,this is from I love you colonel sanders of 2019 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/524825976597643265/781442433434255391/image0.jpg
25-11-2020T15:16:02,SpazztasticKiwi,so it’s very close to the dating sim format

25-11-2020T21:57:27,CrRAR,I am disappointed I did not spot a single pumbaa in that entire mess.
25-11-2020T21:57:47,CrRAR,places needs some hakuna matata
25-11-2020T22:01:57,CrRAR,"old saying feel relevant here, ""Don't wrestle with pigs and expect not to get dirty."""
25-11-2020T22:02:07,CrRAR,...or... feel dirty
25-11-2020T22:08:06,SpazztasticKiwi,the woman needs therapy
25-11-2020T22:08:18,SpazztasticKiwi,and I feel just as bad for the husband
25-11-2020T22:09:40,SpazztasticKiwi,try the pageant videos
25-11-2020T22:46:51,Dadrobit,Goddamn it. Updated my phone and all of my apps have disappeared from my home screen.
25-11-2020T22:47:10,Dadrobit,Even the time/date/temperature bubble.
25-11-2020T22:47:12,CrRAR,"agh, that's going too far"
25-11-2020T22:47:38,CrRAR,yeah once you got everything in a predictable place :ok_hand:
25-11-2020T22:48:14,Dadrobit,I have no idea how to reset it. Tried turning it off and on again and it didn't fix it...
25-11-2020T22:49:21,CrRAR,I hate the minor irreversible changes they make to the layouts sometimes.... it'll often mess with like the look with a background or something....
25-11-2020T22:49:52,CrRAR,just because they decide to shimy a UI element like a mm or two
25-11-2020T22:50:16,CrRAR,does it let you readd shortcuts again?
25-11-2020T22:53:25,Dadrobit,Everything is still downloaded and I can see all of my apps from.the drag down menu. Just everything is gone from my front page and all my quick access pages.
25-11-2020T22:55:15,Dadrobit,https://imgur.com/a/nxnInIT
25-11-2020T22:55:47,Dadrobit,That's all I have left.
25-11-2020T22:55:55,CrRAR,"oh wow it even has all the ""pages"""
25-11-2020T22:55:56,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-maddiessparkles: so empty
25-11-2020T22:56:32,Dadrobit,"Yeah, and it's not that they're invisible, cuz clicking where things should be does nothing."
25-11-2020T22:56:42,CrRAR,"dang OEM launchers I tell ya what, man"
25-11-2020T22:57:03,Dadrobit,"I can drag new app shortcuts to my pages, but I dunno how or even if I can restore the old ones."
25-11-2020T22:57:13,CrRAR,maybe google the launcher/brand and see if anyone else experienced?
25-11-2020T22:57:29,Dadrobit,Nothing new on google/bing
25-11-2020T22:57:46,CrRAR,dang
25-11-2020T22:57:58,Dadrobit,"Just fixes for individual missing apps like, ""how to restore your setting shortcut"""
25-11-2020T22:59:36,Dadrobit,"Honestly, I wouldn't mind re-doing my app pages. I had a ton of old clutter I never used clogging it up anyways. But my clock widget being gone is actually killer."
25-11-2020T23:00:41,CrRAR,"I think you can get that back, usually there a ""customize"" home screen menu that lets you grag in widgets"
25-11-2020T23:00:48,CrRAR,*drag
25-11-2020T23:01:34,CrRAR,"I thought in new android it's like in the ""open apps"" browser windows thing"
25-11-2020T23:01:47,CrRAR,or maybe settings too
25-11-2020T23:02:32,Dadrobit,Looking through my settings now
25-11-2020T23:02:49,CrRAR,oh try holding right in the blank space
25-11-2020T23:03:03,CrRAR,like anywhere on the wallpaper
25-11-2020T23:03:19,CrRAR,"I get a menu that's has ""widgets"""
25-11-2020T23:03:38,CrRAR,"including clock, digital or analog"
25-11-2020T23:04:26,CrRAR,there has to be an equivalent way to open that on other brands
25-11-2020T23:04:36,CrRAR,I have a Pixel though
25-11-2020T23:04:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Jesus
25-11-2020T23:04:49,SpazztasticKiwi,your phone is naked
25-11-2020T23:04:55,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-MikeLewd:

25-11-2020T23:06:00,SpazztasticKiwi,......I’m pretty sure that’s the phone my grandma just got
25-11-2020T23:06:14,CrRAR,:iphone::ctwokinds-daydreamingkat:*[rejoice!]
25-11-2020T23:06:59,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s got a slide up and slide down menu
25-11-2020T23:07:07,SpazztasticKiwi,and recents menu
25-11-2020T23:07:13,SpazztasticKiwi,then the home screen
25-11-2020T23:07:26,CrRAR,yeah too many things to explain these days
25-11-2020T23:07:41,CrRAR,but... you can talk to it now!
25-11-2020T23:07:52,CrRAR,or yell at it
25-11-2020T23:08:32,CrRAR,"""We made this thing we've been working to simplify for so long so complicated... now you have to talk to it"""
25-11-2020T23:08:32,SpazztasticKiwi,the people that upgraded her phone never transferred it
25-11-2020T23:08:52,CrRAR,yeah they hate doing any extra anything these days
25-11-2020T23:09:09,CrRAR,they used to demonstrate things and go over basics
25-11-2020T23:09:27,CrRAR,and made it a mission to like keep everything the same
25-11-2020T23:09:45,SpazztasticKiwi,she had to replace the old one and it was never brought over to the new model
25-11-2020T23:10:19,SpazztasticKiwi,they should since our plan has free upgrade after a year
25-11-2020T23:11:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"after a year with a phone we can go back and get the next model up free, should there be a new model"
25-11-2020T23:11:42,SpazztasticKiwi,that’s probably a good reason I’d like to talk to Mark
25-11-2020T23:11:49,SpazztasticKiwi,he’s got the 11
25-11-2020T23:11:51,Dadrobit,"Thanks kindly CrRAR, found my time/weather widgets."
25-11-2020T23:11:59,CrRAR,:ok_hand:
25-11-2020T23:12:07,CrRAR,nice
25-11-2020T23:12:07,Dadrobit,Still on the Note 9 myself.
25-11-2020T23:12:12,CrRAR,ah okay
25-11-2020T23:12:23,SpazztasticKiwi,I want to know if he thinks it’s worth it or if he cares
25-11-2020T23:12:23,CrRAR,is there a new one?
25-11-2020T23:12:29,Dadrobit,No upgrade path for me. Not without a 3.5 jack.
25-11-2020T23:12:29,SpazztasticKiwi,me?
25-11-2020T23:12:36,CrRAR,ah right
25-11-2020T23:12:57,CrRAR,"wait who has a 10, spazz?"
25-11-2020T23:13:02,SpazztasticKiwi,11
25-11-2020T23:13:02,CrRAR,...or earlier?
25-11-2020T23:13:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Mark has the iphone 11
25-11-2020T23:13:11,Dadrobit,"Fuckin Apple and their ""Bravery"""
25-11-2020T23:13:20,CrRAR,I know people that have the tri-camera love it
25-11-2020T23:13:42,SpazztasticKiwi,as far as I know anyway - the one he’s got in videos sure looks like one
25-11-2020T23:14:06,CrRAR,"otherwise the rest of the changes, eh, you really just finally upgrade when battery life gets lame"
25-11-2020T23:14:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I have the xr - it was the most brand new model when I upgraded my 6s+ (poor thing was wheezing after 3 years)
25-11-2020T23:14:54,Ordithus,"S8, I'll keep this til it dies"
25-11-2020T23:14:58,SpazztasticKiwi,then they came out with the 11 and others shortly after
25-11-2020T23:14:58,Ordithus,like my S5
25-11-2020T23:15:08,Ordithus,and the iphone 4 before it
25-11-2020T23:15:23,CrRAR,"wow, marathon man"
25-11-2020T23:15:29,Ordithus,mostly because I am cheap
25-11-2020T23:15:48,CrRAR,yeah I skip like every other gen
25-11-2020T23:15:54,SpazztasticKiwi,I didn’t see any difference and I still don’t but if it’s cool enough I might upgrade in the next year or two
25-11-2020T23:15:57,CrRAR,"I've had Pixels a while and right now have the 3XL with the notch, the 4 dumped the notch altogether which was dumb"
25-11-2020T23:16:02,Ordithus,and I don't demand much of my phone
25-11-2020T23:16:12,CrRAR,the Pixel 5 tho goes to a hole-punch camera
25-11-2020T23:16:17,Ordithus,wat
25-11-2020T23:16:26,CrRAR,"so no notch, just full screen display on the front"
25-11-2020T23:16:39,CrRAR,Like what some of the LGs have
25-11-2020T23:16:46,Ordithus,oh that is weird
25-11-2020T23:16:46,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’ll tell you what the home button disappearance was wild but as soon as I adapted to it, it’s so much faster"
25-11-2020T23:16:56,CrRAR,I think some of the OnePluses too
25-11-2020T23:17:13,CrRAR,yeah they added gesture abilities in Android
25-11-2020T23:17:16,CrRAR,I like it
25-11-2020T23:17:30,CrRAR,swipey swipey
25-11-2020T23:17:51,SpazztasticKiwi,"problem I find with the 11 is all the praise I’ve seen is for the camera, which I guess is nice but is that all it’s got goin for it?"
25-11-2020T23:17:51,CrRAR,thou sometimes it's a bit cludgey
25-11-2020T23:18:11,CrRAR,yeah pretty much
25-11-2020T23:18:27,CrRAR,They added faster face recog I think at one point
25-11-2020T23:18:43,CrRAR,Also moving from the Xr the bezels are TINYYY
25-11-2020T23:19:14,CrRAR,it really makes a difference in how quality it looks
25-11-2020T23:19:36,CrRAR,like almost to the edge displays
25-11-2020T23:19:51,Ordithus,I recently wiped that iphone 4 to dispose of it. the screen is so itty bitty
25-11-2020T23:20:07,CrRAR,"oh yeah, huge diff"
25-11-2020T23:20:13,CrRAR,They still make the SE
25-11-2020T23:20:35,CrRAR,the SE 2 came out like 6ish months ago
25-11-2020T23:20:37,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t use face recog
25-11-2020T23:20:43,SpazztasticKiwi,passwords just fine
25-11-2020T23:20:48,CrRAR,yeah I don't like it too much
25-11-2020T23:21:07,CrRAR,Androids mostly kept the fing reader on the back
25-11-2020T23:21:11,SpazztasticKiwi,bezels...
25-11-2020T23:21:17,CrRAR,been like that since the nexus
25-11-2020T23:21:25,CrRAR,I like that it's there
25-11-2020T23:21:40,Dadrobit,":/ I'll probably just keep buying unlocked Note 9's for the foreseeable future. Love this phone, the pen is awesome. And it's powerful enough that I have yet to encounter slowdown or stuttering from anything hardware wise."
25-11-2020T23:21:55,CrRAR,also because the bezel is smaller the phone is a wee bit more compact
25-11-2020T23:22:11,CrRAR,"like the ""frame"" around the edge spazz"
25-11-2020T23:22:35,CrRAR,yeah Samsung's stuff is always solid
25-11-2020T23:22:58,CrRAR,Last one I had was a S5 I think the last one with a removable battery ;_;
25-11-2020T23:23:16,Ordithus,it was too good
25-11-2020T23:23:22,CrRAR,it really was
25-11-2020T23:23:23,Ordithus,could not be allowed to live on
25-11-2020T23:23:39,Dadrobit,I happened to use my Droid Turbo 2 like a week ago because I was filming with the Note and needed to read a script.
25-11-2020T23:23:46,Ordithus,"removable battery, sd card slot, durable enough to not need a case"
25-11-2020T23:23:54,CrRAR,yup
25-11-2020T23:24:11,Ordithus,headphone jack!
25-11-2020T23:24:12,Dadrobit,"Powering up the old Droid and I said to myself, ""How the Hell did I live with this screen???"""
25-11-2020T23:24:20,CrRAR,haha
25-11-2020T23:24:37,CrRAR,yeah the pen bit is good for notes? right?
25-11-2020T23:24:46,CrRAR,Does it do good transcribing?
25-11-2020T23:25:01,SpazztasticKiwi,my xr screen is much bigger than my 6s+but they’re not that different in size
25-11-2020T23:25:09,SpazztasticKiwi,both are about 6 inches
25-11-2020T23:25:13,Dadrobit,"I love my pen. Taking ""physical"" notes is great."
25-11-2020T23:25:21,SpazztasticKiwi,more with the case
25-11-2020T23:25:46,CrRAR,"yeah Xr's get bulky with cases, the floppy TPU ones are nice though!"
25-11-2020T23:26:15,CrRAR,not super thick but better protection than a thin film one
25-11-2020T23:26:30,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s not real bulky to me
25-11-2020T23:26:37,SpazztasticKiwi,thicc case good case
25-11-2020T23:26:57,CrRAR,thicc bricc case hehe
25-11-2020T23:27:12,SpazztasticKiwi,I like one with a lip over the screen and the camera so if it falls it technically lands on the case borders and not the screen
25-11-2020T23:27:47,CrRAR,yeah mines got probably like 2-3mm of a ridge
25-11-2020T23:28:06,CrRAR,prolly 2 at most I guess
25-11-2020T23:28:14,CrRAR,nuf to keep it safe
25-11-2020T23:28:42,SpazztasticKiwi,"DAYS after I put this new protector and case on it dropped out of my pocket, bounced out and off the step of the car, and tap danced on the parking lot concrete"
25-11-2020T23:29:42,CrRAR,:cw0lfmare-VivianPanic: *boinkboinkboink*
25-11-2020T23:31:53,CrRAR,but yeah supposedly now the screen w/o notches some actually use the glass as like the speaker element I guess?
25-11-2020T23:32:06,CrRAR,like no actual speaker opening
25-11-2020T23:32:30,CrRAR,the sound transmits through the glas from beneath the screen
25-11-2020T23:32:30,SpazztasticKiwi,wat
25-11-2020T23:32:41,CrRAR,yeah it's weird
25-11-2020T23:32:54,Ordithus,probably not very good
25-11-2020T23:33:06,CrRAR,kinda like the idea of the fingerprint readers that could be under the display I guess?
25-11-2020T23:33:13,CrRAR,"yeah idk, lol"
25-11-2020T23:33:24,SpazztasticKiwi,sometimes my phone’s ridiculously loud but that’s often from youtube
25-11-2020T23:33:33,SpazztasticKiwi,there’s a front and bottom speaker
25-11-2020T23:33:44,CrRAR,You would think it would just sound like Charlie Brown parents.
25-11-2020T23:33:44,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I've heard of the glass speakers. Never heard anything good about them, but I've heard"
25-11-2020T23:33:53,CrRAR,yeah
25-11-2020T23:33:58,SpazztasticKiwi,that might work for waterproofing and keep lint out
25-11-2020T23:34:05,CrRAR,yeah
25-11-2020T23:34:23,CrRAR,I mean I can't see it being awful just adding a gap there
25-11-2020T23:34:23,SpazztasticKiwi,jeez you should’ve seen my phone when I cleaned it for the new protector and case
25-11-2020T23:34:52,CrRAR,yeah the stuff that seeps in can be surprising
25-11-2020T23:35:34,SpazztasticKiwi,archeological dig
25-11-2020T23:35:38,CrRAR,"the old early iphones had more seams, stuff would kinda cake in there"
25-11-2020T23:35:41,CrRAR,yeah xD
25-11-2020T23:35:43,Dadrobit,"That's one part I don't like about the Note. The glass protectors are ass. Had two of them, both just fell off and cracked themselves."
25-11-2020T23:35:45,SpazztasticKiwi,I found little black hairs
25-11-2020T23:35:59,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-floAAA:
25-11-2020T23:36:01,CrRAR,bageheeraaaaa
25-11-2020T23:36:11,SpazztasticKiwi,get a cat
25-11-2020T23:36:18,SpazztasticKiwi,you’ll never escape the hair
25-11-2020T23:36:22,Dadrobit,"Now I'm bare glass. Couple micro-scratches on the screen, but it's not terrible."
25-11-2020T23:36:39,SpazztasticKiwi,no hairs from Kiwi
25-11-2020T23:36:39,CrRAR,yeah idk what's wrong with protective glass makers these days
25-11-2020T23:36:43,SpazztasticKiwi,just Bagheera
25-11-2020T23:37:07,SpazztasticKiwi,folks I’d like to tell you about my friend bodyguardz...
25-11-2020T23:37:14,SpazztasticKiwi,that’s my screen protector
25-11-2020T23:37:17,CrRAR,so many lately I can't get good ones that don't have an edge that lays flat
25-11-2020T23:37:42,CrRAR,"so it has that stupid grey ""bubble ring"" aroundthe whole thing"
25-11-2020T23:37:55,CrRAR,does stay stuck though
25-11-2020T23:38:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"it’s like $50 for a protector but they’re edge to edge, come with a application guide, cleaning and dust wipes, and free replacements"
25-11-2020T23:38:36,SpazztasticKiwi,and spy glass versions
25-11-2020T23:38:41,CrRAR,ah nice
25-11-2020T23:39:09,CrRAR,yeah I think I've tried the spigen ones on Xr's... not tried the bodyguardz ones though
25-11-2020T23:39:33,Dadrobit,"I had ""free"" replacements with my carrier. Turns out they're free so long as they have them. So they just stop carrying them and suddenly ""free"" goes away."
25-11-2020T23:39:48,CrRAR,wow
25-11-2020T23:40:03,CrRAR,and lately I've found... that's not terribly long
25-11-2020T23:40:08,SpazztasticKiwi,i tried this puregear when I swapped phones cause at&t swapped protector brands
25-11-2020T23:40:15,Dadrobit,They stopped having any within like 2 months of me getting the phone.
25-11-2020T23:40:33,SpazztasticKiwi,their customer service is so trash I never got an answer to how to register my protector for free replacements
25-11-2020T23:40:50,CrRAR,yeah I feel like 6 months after gen availability of a phone all accessories disappear off the face of the planet
25-11-2020T23:41:10,SpazztasticKiwi,"so I bought one new from bodyguardz finally to replace it instead - They, at least, are responsive"
25-11-2020T23:41:53,CrRAR,"yeah looking at my history I've bought tons of ""TechArmor"" ones"
25-11-2020T23:42:00,Dadrobit,The OtterBox carrier I have is still pretty great at least.
25-11-2020T23:42:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"when bodyguardz got a new protector for the 6s+, they auto shipped it as my last replacement when I ordered it"
25-11-2020T23:42:25,SpazztasticKiwi,"despite me technically having a different, discontinued version"
25-11-2020T23:43:03,CrRAR,"uh, task failed successfully?"
25-11-2020T23:43:13,CrRAR,spontaneous upgrade!

25-11-2020T23:44:31,CrRAR,"yeah, techarmor, some spigen, like one mr. shield, other assorted oddities."
25-11-2020T23:44:56,SpazztasticKiwi,why does mr shield sound like mr cleans bodybuilding brother
25-11-2020T23:46:09,CrRAR,that would be at least an inspiring mascot
25-11-2020T23:46:33,CrRAR,I think I bought one direct off GoogleStore too once and it ended up being almost the same shoddy thing that fell off anyway my last phone as what I could find for it on Amazon/eBay.
25-11-2020T23:48:10,Dadrobit,"Welp, got my new app pages organized more or less. Feels weird. Muscle memory of app selection is gonna be annoying to get over."
25-11-2020T23:48:48,CrRAR,"haha, it really is such a weird expectoration"
25-11-2020T23:48:54,CrRAR,*hovers finger*
25-11-2020T23:48:58,CrRAR,*looks down*
25-11-2020T23:49:10,CrRAR,"""You're... not what I want"""
25-11-2020T23:49:26,CrRAR,"""but what WAS here?"" :thinking:"
25-11-2020T23:50:16,CrRAR,"then you rearrange them, and your memory is close but within like two swip-swaps of perfect."
25-11-2020T23:50:27,Dadrobit,"App default places things at the top, bit I specifically reorganized things to be on the bottom right for easy thumb access instead of having to reach up half a kilometer for things in the top left."
25-11-2020T23:50:40,CrRAR,ah yeah
25-11-2020T23:50:42,Dadrobit,But*

25-11-2020T23:56:06,CrRAR,nice
25-11-2020T23:56:13,Dadrobit,"Not the prettiest thing, but I think ergonomically it'll feel better over time."
25-11-2020T23:57:03,CrRAR,the other thing that can be useful is the app bucket grouping thing so like one little shortcut expands to a quick selector of the contents
25-11-2020T23:57:33,Dadrobit,I'm not a fan of that myself
25-11-2020T23:58:06,CrRAR,yeah you forget what's in what bucket where if you have multiple
25-11-2020T23:58:44,Dadrobit,"Exactly, there are a couple built in buckets (Samsung and Google) and I'm constantly forgetting things are in there."
25-11-2020T23:59:09,CrRAR,"they really should have like a more refined almost pallet selector, for like that radius you have setup"
25-11-2020T23:59:21,CrRAR,(like within tap distance)
25-11-2020T23:59:57,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I was going for thumb radius, exactly. Minus the far bottom right to avoid accidental presses"
