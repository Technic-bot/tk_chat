04-11-2020T10:57:47,AspiringNoodle,RIP Intel
04-11-2020T10:58:12,SonOfGoku,Yeah
04-11-2020T11:00:06,AspiringNoodle,AMD's new 5600X (6c/12t $299 USD) is beating Intel's 10900k (10c/20t $499 - $529 USD) processor in game performance
04-11-2020T11:00:50,AspiringNoodle,Intel is officially the worse brand :|
04-11-2020T11:01:30,AspiringNoodle,Just to drive in how much faster the new AMD processors are.
04-11-2020T11:02:08,AspiringNoodle,CS:GO - Dust II 1080p Very High no AA (Average FPS)
04-11-2020T11:02:20,AspiringNoodle,10900k: 544
04-11-2020T11:02:26,AspiringNoodle,5600X: 666 (nice)
04-11-2020T11:02:49,AspiringNoodle,Intel ded
04-11-2020T11:25:56,CrRAR,The fact that Intel let the model numbers wrap around to above 10k without a rename tells me they basically given up.
04-11-2020T11:26:25,CrRAR,Like that alone indicates their management is just asleep on the job.
04-11-2020T11:26:47,CrRAR,>not even a logical marketing revamp
04-11-2020T11:26:55,CrRAR,>sure that‚Äôs fine
04-11-2020T11:27:05,CrRAR,>saves MONEY! :D
04-11-2020T11:27:48,AspiringNoodle,Intel is a prime example of what happens to a company when they've had no competition for years
04-11-2020T11:28:10,AspiringNoodle,"They stop trying to push boundaries, focus more on consistent, incremental improvements, and more or less rest on their laurels, try to maximize profit."
04-11-2020T11:28:29,CrRAR,"Yeah, they have responded to competition in the past, this is just another lazy era for them I guess."
04-11-2020T11:28:36,AspiringNoodle,"AMD comes along and starts making waves, and Intel actually had to start TRYING again."
04-11-2020T11:28:51,CrRAR,Like the Core series in 2006 was a huge wake-up for them
04-11-2020T11:28:57,AspiringNoodle,Well... now Intel has hit some major road bumps in trying to improve.
04-11-2020T11:29:20,CrRAR,They realized they HAD TO or would die cuz of the Athlon 64
04-11-2020T11:29:26,CrRAR,Yeah
04-11-2020T11:29:36,CrRAR,It‚Äôs architecture now
04-11-2020T11:29:43,AspiringNoodle,AMD's approach may be what's needed to keep moving forward.
04-11-2020T11:30:02,CrRAR,...and Intel has actually lost advantage owning their own fabs.
04-11-2020T11:30:05,AspiringNoodle,"Intel's whole approach of ""We design one single CHIP for every processor because muh quality"" is a bad design approach..."
04-11-2020T11:30:25,CrRAR,Which was one of their superiority complexes for so long
04-11-2020T11:30:33,CrRAR,But now it‚Äôs a weakness
04-11-2020T11:30:52,CrRAR,cuz it‚Äôs made them too inflexible
04-11-2020T11:31:00,AspiringNoodle,Fun fact: Every single intel processors (bar Xeon) is designed by creating one giant monolith chip for every product SKU.
04-11-2020T11:31:51,CrRAR,Yeah Xeon expansion to consumer is a huge gaff just to score higher pricetags for uninformed folks
04-11-2020T11:32:04,AspiringNoodle,"While I'm sure they can disable some cores should it not pass quality control and be branded as a lower quality product, AMD's approach allows them to scale up, with a solid baseline."
04-11-2020T11:32:33,CrRAR,They are usually superior specimen CPUs but they‚Äôre really not incredibly different
04-11-2020T11:32:54,AspiringNoodle,"Also, Intel is a joke from a professional viewpoint.  To get ECC memory you HAVE to bump up to Xeons, which charge a ridiculous premium for business features."
04-11-2020T11:33:25,AspiringNoodle,Xeon is definitely designed for longevity.  Lower core clocks and power consumption as a tradeoff for stability.
04-11-2020T11:33:44,AspiringNoodle,"But if you're a solo professional working from home, AMD's entire product stack offers ECC memory support baseline."
04-11-2020T11:33:50,CrRAR,"Yeah but ECC is just for computation integrity, you lose performance."
04-11-2020T11:34:19,CrRAR,Like ECC makes sense for large-scale computational maybe like finance industry stuff
04-11-2020T11:34:47,CrRAR,Cuz they can‚Äôt tolerate a minor data problem
04-11-2020T11:35:07,AspiringNoodle,"On the bright side, I can't wait to upgrade to a 12-core :D"
04-11-2020T11:35:45,CrRAR,"Yeah, I haven‚Äôt read benchmarks in ages, are games and apps crazy threaded now?"
04-11-2020T11:37:34,AspiringNoodle,"Games are *slowly* heading that direction.  But for the most part, higher core count CPUs also tend to have better single-thread performance"
04-11-2020T11:38:11,AspiringNoodle,"Looking at some of the benchmarks for the new 5000 series processors, the 5900X (12c) seems to have the best gaming performance."
04-11-2020T11:38:30,CrRAR,Oh yeah I think AMD would have the same thing but turbo on Intel kicks in when a few cores are in use and kick the Ghz way up
04-11-2020T11:38:51,AspiringNoodle,"May not always have the highest average FPS compared to the 5950X, but the minimums tend to be higher, which means the dips in framerate aren't as bad and the experience will be more enjoyable."
04-11-2020T11:38:55,CrRAR,Cuz one core at a high clocks is fine if the rest are sitting idle
04-11-2020T11:39:10,CrRAR,yeah
04-11-2020T11:39:29,AspiringNoodle,"So if you're building a gaming rig, the 5900X is as high as you'd want to go.  It'll also save you $200 or so"
04-11-2020T11:39:50,AspiringNoodle,"And as an added bonus, with 12 cores it can double as an excellent streaming rig"
04-11-2020T11:40:38,AspiringNoodle,"At most, games these days will only take advantage of 8 cores, so that leaves 4 to handle OS tasks and any background programs."
04-11-2020T11:44:26,AspiringNoodle,"Also, I think Windows' scheduler still needs optimization for high thread-count cpus xD"
