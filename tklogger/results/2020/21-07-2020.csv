21-07-2020T02:12:26,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Laura ra ra ra Rasputin
21-07-2020T02:12:56,Werewing,Tom has drawn everything. Except anthro birds.
21-07-2020T02:13:17,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,Tom hasn't done the lewds though
21-07-2020T02:13:19,Werewing,Most of them involve Laura or Nora at this point.
21-07-2020T02:14:02,Werewing,I would argue most of Tom's work is lewd. His self-insert as a pizza guy set that tone irrevocably.
21-07-2020T02:14:15,Dadrobit,http://twokindscomic.com/ArchiveForum/viewtopic.php?p=72374#p72374
21-07-2020T02:14:43,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,no I mean true lewds with the stuff we don't speak of here
21-07-2020T02:14:56,BadFoMo,Yep.

21-07-2020T02:15:33,Dadrobit,"People flipped the fuck out, ngl"
21-07-2020T02:15:38,Werewing,Friendly Fischbach.
21-07-2020T02:15:40,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,I watch other artists for lewd stuffs
21-07-2020T02:16:20,FloofyCat,"How do you pronounce ""Fischbach"" anyway?"
21-07-2020T02:16:35,FloofyCat,"Please don't try and tell me it's anything but ""Fish Back""."
21-07-2020T02:16:42,johnnytho,fish bah?
21-07-2020T02:16:52,Dadrobit,Fish bawk
21-07-2020T02:17:15,BadFoMo,@Dadrobit That's how I do it.
21-07-2020T02:17:24,FirstDawnBreak,That's not a pronunciation I hear of very often: Fish-back
21-07-2020T02:17:26,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,Fish Badonk
21-07-2020T02:17:30,Werewing,Can't be any worse than how I pronounce Key-dree-anne.
21-07-2020T02:17:45,Werewing,I regular notice I actually add a syllable.
21-07-2020T02:17:46,johnnytho,Is this cyber bullying?
21-07-2020T02:17:54,Dadrobit,Dafuq is key-dree-anne???
21-07-2020T02:18:03,FloofyCat,"I've never known anyone with that surname so ""Fish Back"" kinda stuck."
21-07-2020T02:18:12,FloofyCat,Oh gosh I pronounce it similar to that too.
21-07-2020T02:18:16,FloofyCat,"I know it's wrong, but..."
21-07-2020T02:18:22,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,that Fish got back
21-07-2020T02:18:25,Werewing,My gross mispronunciation of the fictional beast people Tom has.
21-07-2020T02:18:54,MarvTheHugPharaoh,How do you say Trace?

21-07-2020T02:19:33,Dadrobit,Today we learn that the A is silent in human names as well
21-07-2020T02:19:37,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,how do you say nklebitter?
21-07-2020T02:19:46,FirstDawnBreak,Or even Basitin. Some people say it as bass-ee-tine
21-07-2020T02:19:50,DarthRexKing,"Finally, I can post on here after internet malfunction. I remember that April fools comic though I was still suspicious. It was a waste of a reader's time. XD"

21-07-2020T17:06:30,NoTalentMan,wait is talking about someone here is bad or what?
21-07-2020T17:06:54,Roughlandin,Tom's chat is SFW. PG-13. Teddy and Ord are mods
21-07-2020T17:06:55,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Sketch topics are

21-07-2020T17:07:43,Roughlandin,Also Marv. I forget a lot because I've never seen Marv actually have to kick or ban anybody
21-07-2020T17:08:00,Roughlandin,Unlike Teddy and Ord. AKA the Ban Bros
21-07-2020T17:08:05,Ordithus,multis share mods

21-07-2020T17:08:43,Ordithus,yeah some streams tend to be tamer than others haha
21-07-2020T17:09:00,Roughlandin,"Tom's is tame. I mean I'M not, but..."

21-07-2020T17:13:09,IronHorseComics,I have returned... with pizza
21-07-2020T17:13:11,FloofyCat,And some downright depressing ones revealing a bit too much depravity
21-07-2020T17:13:14,Ordithus,purp that is adorable
21-07-2020T17:13:18,CrRAR,"some are just rejected for stylistic choice, or for ploty reasons"

21-07-2020T17:13:25,Twokinds,brb
21-07-2020T17:13:28,CrRAR,kk
21-07-2020T17:13:31,Xexanoth,considering the kind of sketches that were drawn the last few streams i'm gonna say at this point only spoilers and straight up 18+ action gets removed
21-07-2020T17:14:08,FloofyCat,There are probably some really suggestive things that get removed if I were to guess.
21-07-2020T17:14:20,Roughlandin,Rejected Suggest Example #1: Mike and Evals [redacted] [redacted] then [SUPER redacted].
21-07-2020T17:14:31,Ordithus,look at Tom's DA and what has already been drawn.  There are a few things on his DA (old) that are probably beyond what he'd do for these.
21-07-2020T17:14:55,Roughlandin,"...Thanks for the info, Ord. *Goes to creep Tom's old DA art*"
21-07-2020T17:15:51,Xexanoth,there's plenty of new stuff with Nora or Evals sister (and from a dialogue perspective this weeks Nat and Keith sketch)

21-07-2020T17:46:11,Roughlandin,Eh. Zen and Clovis have actually met. Plus there's actually a good deal of fan art of them. And Zen x Raine was a HUGE ship back before Zen x Kat gained my canon traction
21-07-2020T17:46:19,w0lfmare,Right purple
21-07-2020T17:46:37,Tamma,oh i know ^^ i just love those two <3

21-07-2020T19:24:34,TeapotOfDoom,ohhhh i just remembered something
21-07-2020T19:24:45,TeapotOfDoom,i have a feature request
21-07-2020T19:24:52,TeapotOfDoom,exporting character sheets
21-07-2020T19:25:00,SkeletonJester,Exporting?
21-07-2020T19:25:08,TeapotOfDoom,roll20 can't do that and it annoys me to hell and back
21-07-2020T19:25:14,Kameloh,like to a .txt file?
21-07-2020T19:25:24,TeapotOfDoom,json maybe
21-07-2020T19:25:30,SkeletonJester,"Oh, like the stats and stuff?"
21-07-2020T19:25:39,TeapotOfDoom,but i was thinking more like export to pdf
21-07-2020T19:25:41,TeapotOfDoom,ye
21-07-2020T19:25:55,Kameloh,it shouldn't be too hard
21-07-2020T19:26:08,TeapotOfDoom,(tell that roll20)
21-07-2020T19:26:11,Kameloh,$array = json_encode($character_data);
21-07-2020T19:26:16,Kameloh,where $character_data is an array
21-07-2020T19:26:18,TeapotOfDoom,yea
21-07-2020T19:26:30,Dragusthor,I lost something?
21-07-2020T19:26:39,TeapotOfDoom,that would be something really valuable
21-07-2020T19:26:43,Kameloh,let's see
21-07-2020T19:27:03,Kameloh,lemme add that to my todo
21-07-2020T19:27:19,TeapotOfDoom,or provide some kind of design api thingy where you can select where to put data
21-07-2020T19:27:36,TeapotOfDoom,so you could hit print as dnd sheet and it fills in all the info
21-07-2020T19:27:46,TeapotOfDoom,and spits out a pdf
21-07-2020T19:28:09,Dragusthor,very informatic I at least. eheh

21-07-2020T20:45:27,SkeletonJester,So they've gotta figure out converting existing characters and stuff into the new systems

21-07-2020T20:46:49,SkeletonJester,Lots of QoL changes though
21-07-2020T20:47:39,SkeletonJester,Like - you know how your gear has specific slots? They're making it so that everyone effectively has the same number - it's going to depend on the actual gems themselves to determine the number of extras you get
21-07-2020T20:47:51,SkeletonJester,Andthen some changes to how passives and active skills work
21-07-2020T20:48:03,SkeletonJester,Plus additional gem types that will allow for multiple actives to be used

21-07-2020T23:10:38,SkeletonJester,"So, Kame, something else I was curious about, if you don't mind me asking - you said you were allergic to most fruit, so is it like, the pollen or just the whole fruit for some reason?"
21-07-2020T23:11:02,Kameloh,probably the whole thing!
21-07-2020T23:11:10,SkeletonJester,Just cause my younger brother has a similar issue - but it's mostly just with the pollen on the outside usually
21-07-2020T23:11:27,SkeletonJester,"He has to like, peel and wash any fruit/veg really thoroughly in order to be ok to eat it"
21-07-2020T23:12:14,Kameloh,naw it's everything XD
