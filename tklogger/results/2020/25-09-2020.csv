25-09-2020T00:30:08,SpazztasticKiwi,I was thinking it had to be an original of toms but I wasn’t sure enough on who it was exactly to say anything
25-09-2020T00:30:25,SageSaga,you are responsible for your sense of humor- i dont blame your fingers for typing
25-09-2020T00:30:31,SpazztasticKiwi,she reminds me of saria
25-09-2020T00:30:48,CrRAR,tru
25-09-2020T00:30:51,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I was thinking it was some obscure side character from an old project."
25-09-2020T00:31:13,Ordithus,obscure side character from a new project instead!
25-09-2020T00:31:24,K3IDRAN,Well yeah plus i'm a troll but only on Halo
25-09-2020T00:31:42,Dadrobit,"Still need to try that maze, might hit it up on the weekend."
25-09-2020T00:32:03,K3IDRAN,My computer just lags in nc
25-09-2020T00:32:11,SpazztasticKiwi,I want to have a time where I sit n watch it but I’m not off work for another day

25-09-2020T00:34:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Sage you don’t have shirt merch do you
25-09-2020T00:34:15,CrimsonHelsing,"Thanks for the stream, Tom. See you Sunday"
25-09-2020T00:34:54,K3IDRAN,I really need to start getting my interests back into. History.
25-09-2020T00:35:54,SageSaga,nope not yet- why do ya ask?
25-09-2020T00:36:03,SpazztasticKiwi,curious
25-09-2020T00:36:10,SpazztasticKiwi,I looked at your shop the other day
25-09-2020T00:36:17,SageSaga,just the books on there
25-09-2020T00:36:31,SpazztasticKiwi,and I just thought of something that maybe would be a cool design for one
25-09-2020T00:36:42,Ordithus,:csagesaga-bounce: ?
25-09-2020T00:36:51,K3IDRAN,Ord whyy
25-09-2020T00:36:54,CrRAR,harhar
25-09-2020T00:36:55,SpazztasticKiwi,have you ever seen the boob illusion shirt
25-09-2020T00:37:02,SageSaga,nope
25-09-2020T00:37:02,Ordithus,I have not
25-09-2020T00:37:16,Dadrobit,Wut
25-09-2020T00:37:16,KeefMcDerpface,\o Night all. :ptv-sleepy:
25-09-2020T00:37:21,Ordithus,night keef
25-09-2020T00:37:22,CrRAR,:v: keef
25-09-2020T00:37:23,SpazztasticKiwi,one moment while I shuffle through my files
25-09-2020T00:37:24,Dadrobit,o/ keef
25-09-2020T00:37:37,Ordithus,also the bounce is constantly on sage's stream already
25-09-2020T00:37:37,Ordithus,so
25-09-2020T00:38:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"ok so the boob illusion shirt - if that’s even its name, cause that what I call it - looks like this"
25-09-2020T00:38:50,SpazztasticKiwi,https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/524825976597643265/759287647226036234/image0.jpg
25-09-2020T00:39:02,Ordithus,neat
25-09-2020T00:39:18,Dadrobit,Huh
25-09-2020T00:39:28,SpazztasticKiwi,and an idea for you would be somehow getting your..ahem..ladies’ chests printed on there in the same way
25-09-2020T00:39:39,SpazztasticKiwi,of course this could be for men or women’s shirts
25-09-2020T00:39:41,SageSaga,nice- i can see that being hard to make considering the printing has to be precise
25-09-2020T00:39:45,SpazztasticKiwi,yeah
25-09-2020T00:39:52,SpazztasticKiwi,but wouldn’t it be cool
25-09-2020T00:39:59,Dadrobit,I'd buy one
25-09-2020T00:40:01,SpazztasticKiwi,and spot on with the characters
25-09-2020T00:40:07,CrRAR,lol robit
25-09-2020T00:40:08,SpazztasticKiwi,that’s the point dadro
25-09-2020T00:40:10,AspiringNoodle,"Lmao, that shirt"
25-09-2020T00:40:14,SpazztasticKiwi,people to buy them
25-09-2020T00:40:18,AspiringNoodle,"10 from the front, 2 from the side xD"
25-09-2020T00:40:19,SageSaga,a Kaylin one would be great-
25-09-2020T00:40:32,SageSaga,because it also has the spider netting which would help the illusion
25-09-2020T00:40:39,Ordithus,yeah
25-09-2020T00:40:47,SpazztasticKiwi,e x a c t l y
25-09-2020T00:40:51,AspiringNoodle,"Pay an extra $69, and it'll give you a huge rack for real"
25-09-2020T00:40:52,Dadrobit,I was thinking of the spider web top as well
25-09-2020T00:40:53,K3IDRAN,Agreed
25-09-2020T00:40:55,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-laugh:
25-09-2020T00:42:18,SpazztasticKiwi,buddy if boob jobs were that cheap I wouldnt be so you know what I won’t go there
25-09-2020T00:42:45,SpazztasticKiwi,I like fashion
25-09-2020T00:42:49,SpazztasticKiwi,and design
25-09-2020T00:42:56,SpazztasticKiwi,and crafting
25-09-2020T00:43:02,K3IDRAN,I like Techwear
25-09-2020T00:43:04,AspiringNoodle,I like memes c:
25-09-2020T00:43:15,SpazztasticKiwi,so that idea hit me sometime last night and here we are
25-09-2020T00:43:20,AspiringNoodle,"Also, I can fix that"
25-09-2020T00:43:24,Ordithus,it's a silly shirt and I bet the reactions would be hilarious
25-09-2020T00:43:33,AspiringNoodle,"Pay an extra $69,000 and the Kaylin shirt will give you a huge rack :P"
25-09-2020T00:43:41,SageSaga,my mother would hate it
25-09-2020T00:43:44,K3IDRAN,XD
25-09-2020T00:43:44,SageSaga,i should do it
25-09-2020T00:43:49,SpazztasticKiwi,they’d be pretty popular if I had to guess
25-09-2020T00:43:56,Ordithus,haha
25-09-2020T00:44:04,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s not an awful design it’s just a play on the eyes
25-09-2020T00:44:10,AspiringNoodle,Saaaaaage
25-09-2020T00:44:12,Dadrobit,I remember seeing shirts like it at the flea market 25 years ago. It's an age tested design.
25-09-2020T00:44:20,AspiringNoodle,Emperor Palpatine says you know what: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQRW0RM4V0k
25-09-2020T00:44:24,ZRO4825,Kaylin? I approve. '.'b
25-09-2020T00:44:31,SpazztasticKiwi,it becomes a problem when those who can’t tell where the line for the joke is
25-09-2020T00:44:40,SpazztasticKiwi,go too far
25-09-2020T00:44:48,SageSaga,well a Nyna one would have to make you look flat- and that would only work on people who were already flat?
25-09-2020T00:44:59,SpazztasticKiwi,tell you what
25-09-2020T00:45:06,SpazztasticKiwi,give me a test shirt and I’ll tell you
25-09-2020T00:45:10,Dadrobit,So... Just a Hanes undershirt.
25-09-2020T00:45:11,Ordithus,if it was -very- precise it could probably work
25-09-2020T00:45:37,AspiringNoodle,"A ""makes you look flat"" shirt would likely need to be more tailored to the individual"
25-09-2020T00:45:37,SageSaga,nah ord you cant hide that curve on most women with a t-shirt
25-09-2020T00:46:05,Ordithus,it would only work from one angle
25-09-2020T00:46:23,SpazztasticKiwi,if you order it too small any shirt can make you look flat
25-09-2020T00:46:31,Dadrobit,It just has a shoebox attached to the abdominal section of the shirt.
25-09-2020T00:46:39,SpazztasticKiwi,or make you look like a busted can of biscuits
25-09-2020T00:46:56,Dadrobit,Busted can of biscuits????
25-09-2020T00:47:02,Ordithus,include some party hats
25-09-2020T00:47:09,Ordithus,ps1 lara croft!
25-09-2020T00:47:12,SpazztasticKiwi,did I create a monster
25-09-2020T00:47:23,Dadrobit,"Ohhh, biscuits as in the flaky kind, not cookies, I get it"
25-09-2020T00:47:25,K3IDRAN,Probably
25-09-2020T00:47:26,ZRO4825,Leave the curves alone. All hail boobies. \[T]/
25-09-2020T00:47:43,SpazztasticKiwi,excellent

25-09-2020T00:47:58,ZRO4825,:csagesaga-bounce:
25-09-2020T00:48:02,SpazztasticKiwi,so are you actually going to consider it
25-09-2020T00:48:14,Dadrobit,(flat is justice)
25-09-2020T00:48:38,SpazztasticKiwi,still don’t like that
25-09-2020T00:48:42,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-laura:*[hehe bewbs]
25-09-2020T00:48:45,SageSaga,"the issue is cost - but i would and if i do i will send you one- so long as i remember who you are XD (if you change your name and dont tell me and its years later-"""
25-09-2020T00:48:53,SpazztasticKiwi,yay
25-09-2020T00:49:01,K3IDRAN,2026
25-09-2020T00:49:05,SpazztasticKiwi,changing your name takes work
25-09-2020T00:49:10,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m not into extra work
25-09-2020T00:49:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t know if I have a favorite character yet though
25-09-2020T00:50:15,K3IDRAN,You'll soon get kne
25-09-2020T00:50:23,SpazztasticKiwi,I do like the spiderweb shirt but that’s more of a design preference than a character preference...
25-09-2020T00:50:29,K3IDRAN,One*
25-09-2020T00:51:16,Ordithus,that's cheating!
25-09-2020T00:51:22,Ordithus,and adorable
25-09-2020T00:51:56,SpazztasticKiwi,you know what also works
25-09-2020T00:51:59,SpazztasticKiwi,rouge
25-09-2020T00:52:36,Ordithus,that's work
25-09-2020T00:52:37,Dadrobit,The sneaky assassin thieves?
25-09-2020T00:52:52,SageSaga,but you cant instantly apply makeup for a picture
25-09-2020T00:53:12,SpazztasticKiwi,you underestimate my power
25-09-2020T00:53:16,unsteddyphoenix,So does she become a hardcore m with the outfit on?
25-09-2020T00:53:23,unsteddyphoenix,Assuming she isn't already
25-09-2020T00:53:32,SageSaga,a what?
25-09-2020T00:53:39,ZRO4825,masochist~
25-09-2020T00:53:45,SpazztasticKiwi,who’s out here dressing for cosplay and not doing their makeup till last minute
25-09-2020T00:54:07,Ordithus,brb :bird:
25-09-2020T00:54:09,SageSaga,shes not constantly blushing though
25-09-2020T00:54:39,SpazztasticKiwi,maybe color shift rouge then
25-09-2020T00:54:41,SageSaga,she can do a blush on command- thats the good part
25-09-2020T00:54:51,SpazztasticKiwi,they make that now - expensive as hell
25-09-2020T00:55:12,unsteddyphoenix,"That's a dangerous skill, like crying on command"
25-09-2020T00:55:23,SageSaga,she can do that too
25-09-2020T00:55:32,SpazztasticKiwi,robots. back in my day you had to EMBARRASS YOURSELF for real color
25-09-2020T00:55:40,Dadrobit,:0 double threat!
25-09-2020T00:55:55,SageSaga,she can also rocket punch people!
25-09-2020T00:56:26,ZRO4825,ROCKET PUNCH!!
25-09-2020T00:56:31,Dadrobit,Like... Detachable hand rocket?
25-09-2020T00:56:34,unsteddyphoenix,I never want to interact with her
25-09-2020T00:56:38,SpazztasticKiwi,are you telling me she can mario kart rainbow road her blush
25-09-2020T00:56:49,unsteddyphoenix,Rocket punch is the least scary ability
25-09-2020T00:57:15,SageSaga,of course- who makes a robot/android that cant do a detachable hand rocket punch?
25-09-2020T00:57:48,SpazztasticKiwi,someone who’s not a budding super villain
25-09-2020T00:58:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ll be honest with the shirt think
25-09-2020T00:58:58,SpazztasticKiwi,thing
25-09-2020T00:59:07,SpazztasticKiwi,wasn’t sure you’d actually entertain the idea
25-09-2020T00:59:17,Ordithus,I bach
25-09-2020T00:59:26,SpazztasticKiwi,at least not anything past “cool fam”
25-09-2020T00:59:42,SageSaga,i always want to do more things that i can sell that would be cool- but its not easy and can be expensive
25-09-2020T00:59:54,SpazztasticKiwi,yea
25-09-2020T01:00:09,SpazztasticKiwi,still waiting on Nibbly plushies because of that
25-09-2020T01:00:17,unsteddyphoenix,Oh my god nynas butt
25-09-2020T01:00:27,Ordithus,it's a weapon
25-09-2020T01:00:30,AspiringNoodle,All hail the glory of buttchat \o/
25-09-2020T01:00:39,AspiringNoodle,Nyna is our mascot
25-09-2020T01:01:14,SpazztasticKiwi,related idea: workout shorts with a similar illusion but for character butts
25-09-2020T01:01:24,SpazztasticKiwi,matching sets for your workout
25-09-2020T01:01:39,ZRO4825,"Ya'll can keep your buttchat, I'mma stay on Boobagram. o_o/"
25-09-2020T01:04:04,Dadrobit,I'm still in a state of moderate disbelief that Tom didn't do hats.
25-09-2020T01:04:52,unsteddyphoenix,Like Keith's hat? That sounds like a cute wool thing
25-09-2020T01:04:59,unsteddyphoenix,Id wear that
25-09-2020T01:05:16,Dadrobit,Something stealth like a black hat with an embroidered Templar insignia.
25-09-2020T01:05:28,Dadrobit,I'd legit wear it.
25-09-2020T01:05:50,Ordithus,"or a templar shirt, like the one flora wore for years"
25-09-2020T01:06:14,Dadrobit,"Probably do the insignia of each race, (dunno if there's and established Keidran one or not.)"
25-09-2020T01:08:07,Dadrobit,"It was just funny. When Tom restocked the shop a while back, he mentioned he didn't do hats because no one wears hats. And like three people independently asked about TK hats that day."
25-09-2020T01:10:40,unsteddyphoenix,Lol instant disagreement
25-09-2020T01:12:21,ZRO4825,"EA: ""No one likes single player games anymore.""  Fallen Order: ""Hold my beer."""
25-09-2020T01:13:25,SageSaga,"EA - ""Fine- Single player games dont make as much money"""
25-09-2020T01:13:36,Dadrobit,"Single player is pretty much all I even play anymore. Also, hats have become great again since I can't go to a barber."
25-09-2020T01:14:52,unsteddyphoenix,Twokinds masks when
25-09-2020T01:14:58,unsteddyphoenix,Need to get in on that matket
25-09-2020T01:17:12,Ordithus,penpen penguin knife plush would be neat
25-09-2020T01:17:30,SageSaga,plushies are expensive
25-09-2020T01:17:55,SageSaga,Mihari got a quote on a prototype Mihari plushie- it was over 1k
25-09-2020T01:18:08,Ordithus,"wow.  well, they are complex"
25-09-2020T01:18:43,SageSaga,i would have to find like a premade bean boy plush and give it a Penguin skin :P
25-09-2020T01:19:26,SageSaga,wish AR tech would take off though then I could sell virtual merch
25-09-2020T01:20:10,AspiringNoodle,Jesus O_O
25-09-2020T01:20:17,AspiringNoodle,Didn't realize how expensive plushes are...

25-09-2020T01:29:21,SageSaga,yeah- less invasive surgery option Monday morning
25-09-2020T01:29:39,Dadrobit,Most excellent to hear.
25-09-2020T01:29:51,Dadrobit,Hopefully that means less recovery time then.
25-09-2020T01:30:21,SageSaga,"he was like ""This operation works 95% of the time- if it doesnt work then no harm done and we can do the other surgery"
25-09-2020T01:30:29,SageSaga,and yeah days instead of weeks
25-09-2020T01:31:55,Dadrobit,That's super good then
25-09-2020T01:33:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Ferdy ate & now has a lump in his usually noodle body
25-09-2020T01:33:47,SageSaga,that sounds like your talking about a snake and in which case that's normal-
25-09-2020T01:34:16,SpazztasticKiwi,he is snek
25-09-2020T01:36:04,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve sorta been watching it move down his body
25-09-2020T01:37:11,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s like watching a glob of toothpaste move through the tube
25-09-2020T01:37:26,SpazztasticKiwi,but yay surgery happy vibes
25-09-2020T01:39:46,SpazztasticKiwi,don’t die vibes

25-09-2020T14:00:36,BadFoMo,Yo.
25-09-2020T14:00:43,SageSaga,yo
25-09-2020T14:02:37,SageSaga,had a weird dream
25-09-2020T14:03:51,BadFoMo,Back. Wish to share?
25-09-2020T14:05:19,SageSaga,it was very stranger things esque- with me being a little kid with like 4 other kids playing at some barn when this weird fog rolled in and changed things to work like a video game
25-09-2020T14:06:04,SageSaga,like this one kid was tossing rocks at one of the other kids and when the fog rolled in the rocks dealt damage via a number that popped up
25-09-2020T14:06:23,SageSaga,and he found this weird black rock that dealt strangely a lot of damage
25-09-2020T14:07:49,SageSaga,we started leveling up from dealing damage and completing objectives when these weird tentacle creatures started appearing lead by what looked like a bald man with no facial expressions
25-09-2020T14:09:38,sunblaze,hi everyone
25-09-2020T14:09:41,BadFoMo,That is weird.
25-09-2020T14:09:46,BadFoMo,...Yo.
25-09-2020T14:09:48,SageSaga,we ended up running around - chased into the basement where we tried to hide and ended up killing a bunch of the creatures
25-09-2020T14:09:51,SageSaga,yo Sunblaze
25-09-2020T14:10:18,Dakina,Ello
25-09-2020T14:10:23,SageSaga,"he then set the barn on fire and we had to escape- and were like ""Is he farming us for XP?"""
25-09-2020T14:10:29,SageSaga,yo Dakina
25-09-2020T14:11:12,SageSaga,so we ended up having to fight him- we had gotten some interesting skills from leveling- i was the lowest level but had the best hand to hand skills-
25-09-2020T14:11:52,SageSaga,so the guy who was throwing rocks was firing off rocks like rockets by this point and he managed to hit him with one of the black rocks and it did a ton of damage
25-09-2020T14:12:37,SageSaga,so i grabbed 2 of them and went into melee- when he picked up 2 as well and started blocking with them- as they smashed together they were glowing purple and letting off sparks
25-09-2020T14:13:30,SageSaga,i went in to throw him and he did the same and well- game physics went wonky and we both went hundreds of feet up into the air
25-09-2020T14:14:40,SageSaga,his teeth turned to razors and his arms started to go noodly and super long as he tried to wrap me up and put me under him as we were falling back to the ground
25-09-2020T14:15:33,SageSaga,i managed to escape and twist and put my arm under his chin just at the last second as his head hit the ground and exploded in a wave of black energy and smoke
25-09-2020T14:15:44,SageSaga,and i got an alert saying i was now level 100
25-09-2020T14:17:36,SageSaga,then our parents showed up and we all had to go home
25-09-2020T14:18:17,SageSaga,so- pretty weird dream
25-09-2020T14:18:48,BadFoMo,Parent: Our kids are breaking reality again. Time to go home.
25-09-2020T14:19:10,neropan,hoi hoi everyone

25-09-2020T14:27:17,neropan,"I'm doing alrighty, just feeling really rusty and head empty since it's been so long since i drew anything"
25-09-2020T14:28:01,SageSaga,you should fix that considering how great your art is *nod nod*
25-09-2020T14:29:10,K3IDRAN,I'm a horrible artist so i just draw stick figures on DA
25-09-2020T14:29:48,SageSaga,why would you do that?
25-09-2020T14:30:02,neropan,i'm sure they are good quality stick figures
25-09-2020T14:30:22,K3IDRAN,I draw them all on MS paint
25-09-2020T14:30:32,K3IDRAN,With a mouse
25-09-2020T14:31:12,SageSaga,eh- i guess if you enjoy it- but if you do you should work to improve it
25-09-2020T14:31:25,K3IDRAN,I agree with that
25-09-2020T14:31:41,K3IDRAN,I even drew GradeAunderA
25-09-2020T14:33:00,K3IDRAN,You know the big chin guy
25-09-2020T14:33:10,JVDragoon,heya sage stream

25-09-2020T14:34:42,SageSaga,sorry Kiwi- never tried wireless- not since i tried a blutooth headset that could barely function and was awful- but that was many years ago
25-09-2020T14:35:04,Hogan,Eveninges!
25-09-2020T14:35:09,K3IDRAN,Headphones mostly breaks
25-09-2020T14:35:10,SpazztasticKiwi,you make it sound like a warzone flashback
25-09-2020T14:35:17,K3IDRAN,Ikr
25-09-2020T14:35:19,SageSaga,sunblaze- you still here?
25-09-2020T14:37:28,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve been wondering if I care to wait on the shipping for some new airpods or if there’s an actual equal generic to find
25-09-2020T14:37:45,SpazztasticKiwi,so far the only one I’ve found has almost 2 hours less wireless time
25-09-2020T14:38:54,SageSaga,i keep hearing the raycons are really good wireless earbuds and cheaper-
25-09-2020T14:39:12,SpazztasticKiwi,but will it link with siri righ

25-09-2020T14:42:20,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve been window shopping amazon for a few days weighing stress shopping vs why not shopping vs it’s almost my birthday shopping
25-09-2020T14:42:40,SpazztasticKiwi,“treat yoself” is starting to win out
25-09-2020T14:44:08,SageSaga,always check review sites on tech
25-09-2020T14:44:20,SageSaga,make sure you treat yourself to something worth buying

25-09-2020T14:46:44,SpazztasticKiwi,in an effort to be nice I won’t say what was at the front of my mind
25-09-2020T14:47:02,SpazztasticKiwi,but yeah I always always look at all the reviews before getting something

25-09-2020T16:11:48,SageSaga,sorry- my nephew wanted to play on my playstation so i hooked it up for him in the other room
25-09-2020T16:12:11,johnnytho,that how it is : /
25-09-2020T16:12:58,SageSaga,he'll be back soon crying that he cant beat a monster
25-09-2020T16:13:13,johnnytho,lol
25-09-2020T16:13:14,SageSaga,i told him- the only game i had for it was MHW
25-09-2020T16:14:44,SageSaga,forgot my water- brb! XD
25-09-2020T16:15:17,Hogan,Sounds like my son years ago XD
25-09-2020T16:17:00,Hogan,"... until I accidently let him play my save in a game against the endgame boss... I'd just come to that point and had only done two tries on him. Figured it couldn't hurt having him taking a few swings against him, but two tries and he had him defeated..."
25-09-2020T16:17:43,Hogan,It took me two years (months went between I had time to game) to get to that point and then I was derived the glory of the endbattle... :-|
25-09-2020T16:18:57,SageSaga,. . . he named his character Sir Butts
25-09-2020T16:20:10,Hogan,I approve XD
25-09-2020T16:22:06,Hogan,I named most of my followers in Neverwinter according to NSFW puns
25-09-2020T16:24:08,SageSaga,i always took my RPGs seriously- never used my own name and never used silly names
25-09-2020T16:26:10,Hogan,"Can't say I could keep to those standards, at DnD I had a gimmick going on always including something gepgraphical in my name... never used my own name though"
25-09-2020T16:29:56,Hogan,Kaukasus the Barbarian
25-09-2020T16:30:01,Hogan,Kalmar the Monk
25-09-2020T16:30:08,Hogan,India the Elven Archer...
25-09-2020T16:30:19,Hogan,"... yep, guilty as charged"
25-09-2020T16:32:22,SageSaga,brb gotta check on the kid
25-09-2020T16:35:04,FoxxTrotter,:goat:

25-09-2020T16:36:45,Hogan,Thanks for the entertainment and company Sage and the rest of you :-)
25-09-2020T16:41:40,SageSaga,he was really upset because it wouldnt let him do anything till he pressed a button- but he didnt know that button
25-09-2020T16:42:04,SageSaga,it was the big button/touch pad on the PS4 controller XD
25-09-2020T16:42:15,Werewing,"I always use silly names. But you can usually suspend the absurdity, they were never too crazy."
25-09-2020T16:54:59,SageSaga,*sigh* brb
25-09-2020T16:59:21,SageSaga,he got lost in town
25-09-2020T17:00:29,Werewing,Who? And real town or game town?
25-09-2020T17:00:42,SageSaga,my nephew - game town
25-09-2020T17:01:17,Werewing,Which game town?
25-09-2020T17:01:36,SageSaga,Monster Hunter World
25-09-2020T17:10:10,SpazztasticKiwi,the day has so far proven unworth it
25-09-2020T17:10:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I say skip it

25-09-2020T17:11:43,BadFoMo,I'll keep you in my prayers until it's done.

25-09-2020T17:12:19,SpazztasticKiwi,🌊
25-09-2020T17:15:16,SpazztasticKiwi,I have reason to believe I could live on the sun and still be cold
25-09-2020T17:19:20,CrRAR,"Yeah, ever since the two cool days we had I’ve been wearing hoodies instinctually even when its been 70ish"
25-09-2020T17:20:04,SpazztasticKiwi,I wear coats in 90
25-09-2020T17:21:51,CrRAR,Gotta insulate I guess
25-09-2020T17:26:22,SpazztasticKiwi,homesick demon or somethin
25-09-2020T17:26:42,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve googled it before and it could be anemia or diabetes
25-09-2020T17:27:04,SpazztasticKiwi,or it just I’m cold hearted 🤷🏻‍♀️
25-09-2020T17:27:11,SpazztasticKiwi,its
25-09-2020T17:28:36,CrRAR,"Nah, I heard a story of a relative had a mailman in Nevada that it would be like 80 out in a winter coat."
25-09-2020T17:29:23,CrRAR,Lots of people that like on tropical islands too have absolutely no problem wearing jeans
25-09-2020T17:29:42,CrRAR,*live
25-09-2020T17:30:13,SpazztasticKiwi,my dad wore coats in summer but he drank iced everything
25-09-2020T17:31:17,SpazztasticKiwi,that was his problem but I so much as sit still for too long in under 70 and I’m ⛄️
25-09-2020T17:31:48,CrRAR,It must be like the opposite of those people who can train to just meditate to avoid hypothermia
25-09-2020T17:32:13,CrRAR,Yeah esp in the shade it can be chilly at those temps
25-09-2020T17:33:05,CrRAR,I like the winter for winter sports and the snow and whatever but lately do like the cold less
25-09-2020T17:35:45,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t do cold
25-09-2020T18:17:42,CrRAR,"Ooo, my coffee still tastes pretty decent from hours ago"
25-09-2020T18:49:36,CrRAR,Yeah I have a sense my patience with cold and winters will need a break at some point
25-09-2020T18:49:44,CrRAR,"I gotta pick a destination to explore, places with history with like old forts or ruins are usually cool to visit"
25-09-2020T18:50:56,CrRAR,or just somewhere nature-y
25-09-2020T19:32:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I want a beach museum and a convention
25-09-2020T19:33:01,SpazztasticKiwi,in a good city
25-09-2020T19:33:04,SpazztasticKiwi,but not far
25-09-2020T19:46:43,CrRAR,Sounds like not too much to ask for. haha
25-09-2020T20:38:59,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s gotta be crawling with hot guys too
25-09-2020T20:56:23,CrRAR,The museum?
25-09-2020T20:56:33,CrRAR,hehe

25-09-2020T23:01:41,CrRAR,"the older sketcheds are on dA if you dig in scraps I think, you might have already"
25-09-2020T23:02:28,BlackjackSec99,"yep, I just forgot the name"
25-09-2020T23:08:32,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m waiting for a “break me off a piece of that kitkat bar” joke
25-09-2020T23:09:28,SpazztasticKiwi,less likely since it’s off stream
25-09-2020T23:09:39,K3IDRAN,Break me a piece of that kitkat bar as we watch yhe Death star blow up
25-09-2020T23:09:46,K3IDRAN,The

25-09-2020T23:11:27,SpazztasticKiwi,no crrar the goal was not to blow up the kitkat bar
25-09-2020T23:11:58,K3IDRAN,Hos are we gonna celebrate freedom
25-09-2020T23:13:51,AspiringNoodle,Fun shift
25-09-2020T23:14:07,AspiringNoodle,8 hour shift became 10 hour shift with 4 hour solo-time
25-09-2020T23:18:43,SpazztasticKiwi,but did you die
25-09-2020T23:21:40,AspiringNoodle,Does on the inside count?
25-09-2020T23:22:29,CrRAR,Solo time? So you had an unintelligible and overly hairy assistant?
25-09-2020T23:23:07,AspiringNoodle,"Nope, I ran the gas station solo for 4 hours.  2.5 if you count the kitchen guy still being there.  But the whole front end was all me."
25-09-2020T23:23:58,CrRAR,There’s a kitchen guy?
25-09-2020T23:24:16,CrRAR,What’s the specialty?
25-09-2020T23:25:19,AspiringNoodle,Just premade stuff
25-09-2020T23:25:32,AspiringNoodle,"You *can* order anything you want from them, but most people just take the premade items"
25-09-2020T23:26:41,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve run the deli for a whole shift multiple times
25-09-2020T23:27:10,SpazztasticKiwi,aside from the customer part it’s peaceful
25-09-2020T23:27:27,AspiringNoodle,Convenience stores are not made to be run by one person with the traffic they get
25-09-2020T23:28:27,AspiringNoodle,"A long time ago, I was running the store solo because there was a callout and nobody could cover"
25-09-2020T23:28:42,AspiringNoodle,At one point I was stuck on the register for 2 hours straight because of how many customers there were.
25-09-2020T23:29:30,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-natsducky:
25-09-2020T23:29:48,AspiringNoodle,hoi ord

25-09-2020T23:36:10,SpazztasticKiwi,odin cosplaying as thanos
25-09-2020T23:36:19,SpazztasticKiwi,it really is 2020
25-09-2020T23:36:35,SpazztasticKiwi,guess that means odin didn’t really die
25-09-2020T23:37:17,SpazztasticKiwi,also I’ve found more trump memes
25-09-2020T23:38:20,Ordithus,still too much 2020 left
25-09-2020T23:39:50,Dadrobit,"Spazz, you find earbuds yet?"
25-09-2020T23:39:56,Dadrobit,I have reccomendations if not
25-09-2020T23:40:08,Dadrobit,https://www.shure.com/en-US/products/earphones/se215
25-09-2020T23:40:14,Dadrobit,https://www.shure.com/en-US/products/earphones/se425
25-09-2020T23:40:16,SpazztasticKiwi,I was at work
25-09-2020T23:40:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve only been off for 3 hours
25-09-2020T23:41:37,Dadrobit,I use the SE215 model. It's some next level shit.
25-09-2020T23:41:55,Dadrobit,Hella discounts right now as well
25-09-2020T23:42:19,SpazztasticKiwi,how’s it work with apple tho
25-09-2020T23:43:09,SpazztasticKiwi,there’s something similar to that at walmart but it’s got a band thing that holds the buds together
25-09-2020T23:44:08,SpazztasticKiwi,like when the airpods came out there was worry over losing them or one so they came up with a connecting ribbon
25-09-2020T23:44:23,SpazztasticKiwi,effectively turning the buds back into wired headphones
25-09-2020T23:46:11,SpazztasticKiwi,thanks tho
25-09-2020T23:47:03,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m really on the fence about what way I want to go - I’ll go nonapple since it’s cheaper but I want a decent amount of the same features
25-09-2020T23:47:13,Dadrobit,"Looking through the reviews now. Majority have no issues with IPhone. One complained bluetooth stopped working at airports, another complained the left bud would lose connectivity after an hour."
25-09-2020T23:47:23,Dadrobit,Another complained about a different brand
25-09-2020T23:47:39,SpazztasticKiwi,as in they were on the same page or..?
25-09-2020T23:47:47,SpazztasticKiwi,wrong page
25-09-2020T23:47:59,SpazztasticKiwi,I did not sleep last night
25-09-2020T23:48:22,Dadrobit,I searched by IPhone in the reviews section. One result popped up with a guy complaining about another product.
25-09-2020T23:49:03,Dadrobit,A majority of people who mentioned their IPhone in the reviews said that it worked fine with their IPhones.
25-09-2020T23:49:31,SpazztasticKiwi,"$199 - airpods, now that the “”probuds”” are out, are ~$150"
25-09-2020T23:49:32,Dadrobit,These buds also have swappable cables so you can attatch a 3.5 jack at any time.
25-09-2020T23:50:33,SpazztasticKiwi,why on earth is that model originally $349
25-09-2020T23:51:05,Dadrobit,SHURE is legit an incredible brand for quality.
25-09-2020T23:51:17,Ordithus,shure it is
25-09-2020T23:51:37,Dadrobit,"All of my headphones, earbuds, and half my microphones are from them specifically because their shit doesn't stop working."
25-09-2020T23:52:16,SpazztasticKiwi,I read that as “half my microphone”
25-09-2020T23:53:07,SpazztasticKiwi,wondering how do you hodgepodge a microphone for a second there
25-09-2020T23:53:22,Dadrobit,hodgepodge?
25-09-2020T23:53:37,SpazztasticKiwi,frankenstein
25-09-2020T23:53:55,Dadrobit,"I mean, mic repair is a thing"
25-09-2020T23:54:15,SpazztasticKiwi,frankenphone
25-09-2020T23:55:11,SpazztasticKiwi,wouldn’t one logically only need one microphone
25-09-2020T23:55:34,Dadrobit,Yes but actually no
25-09-2020T23:56:50,SpazztasticKiwi,and as much as I want some airpods
25-09-2020T23:57:09,SpazztasticKiwi,wireless headphones mean you got another thing to charge
25-09-2020T23:57:23,Dadrobit,"It's like the color green. Give an artist a set of colored markers, and they can absolutely make anything they want. Give them a set of paints in the exact same colors and they can make the exact same art, but it'll be a different texture that might be"
25-09-2020T23:57:28,Dadrobit,more fitting.
25-09-2020T23:57:51,Dadrobit,"The greens are the same, but the textures are different."
25-09-2020T23:58:01,Dadrobit,Both have applications.
25-09-2020T23:58:19,SpazztasticKiwi,soooooooo...you have multiple microphones to go from plaid voice to suede voice
25-09-2020T23:58:30,SpazztasticKiwi,to canvas voice
25-09-2020T23:58:39,SpazztasticKiwi,and then silk voice...
25-09-2020T23:59:13,Dadrobit,Kinda sorta.
25-09-2020T23:59:26,SpazztasticKiwi,because changing your voices color is heresy
25-09-2020T23:59:35,Dadrobit,"More like, radio work versus narrative work."
25-09-2020T23:59:43,SpazztasticKiwi,“I can hear colors”
