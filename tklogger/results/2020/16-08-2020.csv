16-08-2020T16:05:19,CrRAR,yeah but it could be his juvinile phase coloring
16-08-2020T16:05:23,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôd like to know if mark would be able to sit still for a full body painting session
16-08-2020T16:05:41,CrimsonQuill,"Uuuum, maybe not."
16-08-2020T16:05:43,CrimsonQuill,XD
16-08-2020T16:05:47,CrimsonQuill,Didn't think about that
16-08-2020T16:06:29,SpazztasticKiwi,judging by how much he did not when Ethan was painting him gold my bet is not for how long it would likely take but a paint on of halo armor might fit him
16-08-2020T16:06:39,CrRAR,I like the lil Charlie Brown Woodstock bird
16-08-2020T16:07:28,SpazztasticKiwi,gold paint looked close enough to his skin color but there was also that lighting under his feet
16-08-2020T16:09:03,SpazztasticKiwi,I remember he got painted for that warcraft game or something way back
16-08-2020T16:09:19,SpazztasticKiwi,tribal in blue on his arms & face

16-08-2020T16:16:23,CrRAR,haha
16-08-2020T16:16:54,CrRAR,Yeah I guess if light is focused in the wrong place in the eye that can be bad

16-08-2020T16:17:29,SpazztasticKiwi,five minutes of wait time while he played with them a second & finally said ‚ÄúI need a better perscription‚Äù

16-08-2020T23:21:00,CrRAR,dang
16-08-2020T23:21:51,Dadrobit,Oil slick don't fuck around I guess.
16-08-2020T23:21:53,CrRAR,Yeah roads get slicker or something more than usual out west because of lack of rain typically and oil spots on the roads right?
16-08-2020T23:22:00,Dadrobit,Yup
16-08-2020T23:22:19,CrRAR,Yeah it finally gets to ‚Äúbleed‚Äù out
16-08-2020T23:22:34,CrRAR,Plus maybe dust on top doesn‚Äôt help
16-08-2020T23:22:38,Dadrobit,The oils build up over months without any rain to wash it away. Then the one storm comes around and brings it up.
16-08-2020T23:23:44,CrRAR,"I heard that fact so long ago, it‚Äôs one of those ‚Äúwait, really!?‚Äù type of things. Always stuck with me"
16-08-2020T23:23:47,AspiringNoodle,General rule of thumb: First 15 minutes of any rainstorm is when roads are their slipperiest
16-08-2020T23:23:55,AspiringNoodle,"Now imagine that only happening once a year, lol"
16-08-2020T23:24:13,AspiringNoodle,Must be like trying to drive through a James Bond oil slick...
16-08-2020T23:24:33,Dadrobit,Arizonans cannot drive in rain. It just does not compute that we need to stop going 80 lol
16-08-2020T23:24:42,CrRAR,Hahaha
16-08-2020T23:24:48,CrRAR,That is a good point too
16-08-2020T23:25:14,Dadrobit,I have hydroplaned on the freeway once or thrice as well. It's deceptively slippery.
16-08-2020T23:25:31,Dadrobit,"Traction, traction, traction, suddenly I'm sideways."
16-08-2020T23:25:41,CrRAR,ugh
16-08-2020T23:25:49,CrRAR,Yeah that‚Äôs freaky
16-08-2020T23:26:10,AspiringNoodle,"Haha, I remember one time driving to Uni during a real bad snowstorm"
16-08-2020T23:26:29,AspiringNoodle,"For whatever effing reason, they decided to send out an alert that classes were cancelled at 8:25 A.M."
16-08-2020T23:26:45,AspiringNoodle,...5 minutes after I went outside to start clearing off my car... over an hour and a half before classes...
16-08-2020T23:27:15,CrRAR,Spinout happened to me once driving in winter storm Nemo braving the storm to go snowboarding
16-08-2020T23:27:23,Dadrobit,Worst I ever was in was last year. The rain was unbelievable. Was on the freeway doing 25mph and I still almost need up in a wall. Legit saw half a dozen others wreck. It was legitimately horrifying.
16-08-2020T23:27:30,CrRAR,Was perfectly fine tho
16-08-2020T23:27:32,AspiringNoodle,Highway was completely covered in snow.  Nobody was going over 40.  Watched a truck fishtail into the median and almost roll up the other side of teh bank into oncoming traffic
16-08-2020T23:27:43,Dadrobit,Ended up*
16-08-2020T23:28:01,AspiringNoodle,But I can't complain.  That drive was an experience
16-08-2020T23:28:12,AspiringNoodle,It was genuinely relaxing and super pretty out :ptv-hearts:
16-08-2020T23:28:31,CrRAR,"I was literally tho only one on the hightway at like 5 in the morning, luckily a huge marshmellow snowbank on the shoulder was great safety"
16-08-2020T23:28:47,Dadrobit,Zero relaxation. There is still a dime sized hole in my seat cover where I puckered up.
16-08-2020T23:29:01,AspiringNoodle,LMAO
16-08-2020T23:29:06,AspiringNoodle,Maximum clenchage
16-08-2020T23:29:18,CrRAR,"Old Durango drove on out perfectly fine, day went okay otherwise"
16-08-2020T23:29:29,CrRAR,Yeah it‚Äôs surreal
16-08-2020T23:29:40,CrRAR,‚ÄúAm I... spinning?‚Äù
16-08-2020T23:29:47,CrRAR,‚ÄúWheeeeee‚Äù
16-08-2020T23:29:51,CrRAR,‚ÄúWait‚Äù
16-08-2020T23:29:56,CrRAR,‚ÄúOh no‚Äù
16-08-2020T23:30:41,Dadrobit,"It's really not that unlike jetskiing, except with less control and way more mass."
16-08-2020T23:31:01,CrRAR,"I was probably going 40 on the highway when it happened, I was curious about the 4Wheel Hi/Lo mode and when I swapped it, bad stuff happened."
16-08-2020T23:31:12,CrRAR,NeverAgain
16-08-2020T23:32:23,CrRAR,I think it caused it to disengage probably not so synchronously and the wheels probably didn‚Äôt quite roll how they had been so lost grip
16-08-2020T23:33:02,CrRAR,"I know you can typically swap like that, just not with probably 5 inches of snow on the ground going 40"
16-08-2020T23:33:23,CrRAR,lesson learnt indeed
16-08-2020T23:35:01,Dadrobit,Sometimes I consider moving somewhere cooler. Then I remember that I can barely drive in rain. Helps bring me back to reality.
16-08-2020T23:35:26,CrRAR,haha
16-08-2020T23:35:46,CrRAR,"Yeah we get cold weather weather, no oil slicks though"
16-08-2020T23:35:50,CrRAR,Otherwise my track record driving in snowstorms even in 2WD cars has been stellar
16-08-2020T23:36:15,CrRAR,Honestly snowstorms are like dealing will dinosaurs
16-08-2020T23:36:29,CrRAR,>Keep steady and NO SUDDEN MOVEMENTS
16-08-2020T23:36:31,Dadrobit,"Maybe I'll just buy a summer home in Flagstaff or Greer, that sounds nice."
16-08-2020T23:36:34,Dadrobit,Lmao
16-08-2020T23:36:43,CrRAR,yeah it do
16-08-2020T23:37:36,Dadrobit,"Joking aside, I really do want a house in Flag eventually. That city is so goddamned nice."
16-08-2020T23:38:33,CrRAR,"American Dream: Nice house, white picket fence, flag pole."
16-08-2020T23:38:47,CrRAR,The last thing so nice they named the city after it
16-08-2020T23:38:55,CrRAR,haha
16-08-2020T23:39:00,Dadrobit,Hell yeah
16-08-2020T23:39:22,CrRAR,Many settle at the house and the fence
16-08-2020T23:39:35,CrRAR,Flag pole is baller status
16-08-2020T23:39:39,CrRAR,:ptv-dealwithit:
16-08-2020T23:40:30,CrRAR,"But yeah as long as you don‚Äôt intend to make moves too quickly in a snowstorm it‚Äôs not bad, like you said kinda like a jetski"
16-08-2020T23:40:42,Dadrobit,I'll even play revillie every morning at 6am to remind all my neighbors how awesome my flagpole will be.
16-08-2020T23:40:53,CrRAR,haha
16-08-2020T23:41:05,AspiringNoodle,Raaaaaaaaaaaar
16-08-2020T23:41:07,CrRAR,Flight of the Valkyries FTW
16-08-2020T23:41:20,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-reniderp:
16-08-2020T23:41:34,AspiringNoodle,You know what I'm gonna aaaaaaaaaaaaask
16-08-2020T23:41:34,Dadrobit,Currently 68F there. I wish.
16-08-2020T23:41:43,CrRAR,Alternate revillie :trumpt: and that
16-08-2020T23:41:44,AspiringNoodle,"And dadro, driving in rain is easy"
16-08-2020T23:41:47,AspiringNoodle,Rule 1) Slow the fuck down
16-08-2020T23:41:52,AspiringNoodle,Rule 2) SLOW THE FUCK DOWN
16-08-2020T23:41:56,AspiringNoodle,Rule 3) Refer to rules 1 & 2
16-08-2020T23:42:11,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-laugh:
16-08-2020T23:42:14,CrRAR,"I know nooodle, I‚Äôm supposed to be sleeping rn tho :ptv-pouty:"
16-08-2020T23:42:27,AspiringNoodle,I spent most of today playing WoW
16-08-2020T23:42:35,CrRAR,I‚Äôll find so free time I SWEAR
16-08-2020T23:42:40,AspiringNoodle,And I'm upset because the balance is awful in pvp :ptv-unimpressed:
16-08-2020T23:42:53,CrRAR,I always laugh at ‚Äúwhite knuckle‚Äù driving
16-08-2020T23:43:01,Dadrobit,Motherfucker I was doing 25 in a 65 and still going sideways. Oil slick don't give a damn.
16-08-2020T23:43:05,AspiringNoodle,Blizzard really can't balance shamans worth a damn
16-08-2020T23:43:12,CrRAR,Tbh the best way to drive in snow is less of a solid grip on the wheel
16-08-2020T23:43:19,CrRAR,More loosy goosy
16-08-2020T23:43:23,AspiringNoodle,"Also, I imagine you don't have rain tires"
16-08-2020T23:43:43,AspiringNoodle,"In a state like Arizona, vehicles probably have tires for fuel efficiency / dry road grip"
16-08-2020T23:43:56,Dadrobit,My tires claim to be all weather at least.
16-08-2020T23:43:59,CrRAR,You kinda just have the car find its path and only nudge it slightly when you want to change directions
16-08-2020T23:44:04,AspiringNoodle,What do you have?
16-08-2020T23:44:14,CrRAR,Yeah but hydoplaning don‚Äôt care
16-08-2020T23:44:15,Dadrobit,Fuck if I know off the top of my head.
16-08-2020T23:44:22,AspiringNoodle,The oils on the road may just be that bad for your state
16-08-2020T23:44:25,CrRAR,Hydroplaning is a special beast
16-08-2020T23:44:32,Dadrobit,The oils are that bad
16-08-2020T23:44:36,AspiringNoodle,"Dadro, here's what I use"
16-08-2020T23:44:54,AspiringNoodle,https://www.firestonetire.com/tire/weathergrip
16-08-2020T23:44:57,Dadrobit,I was not joking. 5 minutes of rain and I saw at least two accidents on the freeway.
16-08-2020T23:45:26,AspiringNoodle,"First winter, my tires (which had good ratings btw) could barely grip the snow pulling out from home"
16-08-2020T23:45:40,AspiringNoodle,I would legit slide from a full stop for at least 10 feet before the tires would grip
16-08-2020T23:45:58,AspiringNoodle,These things just laugh at the snow
16-08-2020T23:46:48,CrRAR,"Yeah I‚Äôve seen highways that look like ski trails, stuck travelers in snowbanks every 10 miles or so, conditions sneak up on people"
16-08-2020T23:47:32,CrRAR,Ah yes that is some nice aggressive tread
16-08-2020T23:47:32,AspiringNoodle,"According to my dad, when I left home (can't remember what, probably food), the rear tires were rooster tailing"
16-08-2020T23:47:50,AspiringNoodle,"So these mofos were literally picking snow up and tossing it, lol"
16-08-2020T23:48:19,AspiringNoodle,Best $840 I ever spent~
16-08-2020T23:48:48,CrRAR,Yeah lol I have a pic of my old car dunno how it happened but the entire back of my car was plastered with snow like blow-in insulation looking
16-08-2020T23:49:22,CrRAR,Probably a mix of snow consistency and shredding via tires
16-08-2020T23:49:40,CrRAR,Aresolized that shiz
16-08-2020T23:49:48,AspiringNoodle,The big reason I got those tires is because my car doesn't have 4-wheel
16-08-2020T23:50:10,CrRAR,Looked like a snowglobe exploded or something
16-08-2020T23:50:14,AspiringNoodle,Ha
16-08-2020T23:50:24,CrRAR,Yeah only my newest car has 4wheel
16-08-2020T23:50:44,CrRAR,I had civics all before what I have now
16-08-2020T23:51:14,CrRAR,"Let me tell ya, weight is 2nd determiner of good grip"
16-08-2020T23:51:33,CrRAR,Good tires + heavy car makes a huge difference
16-08-2020T23:51:47,AspiringNoodle,I'm looking at a civic for my next car
16-08-2020T23:52:07,AspiringNoodle,"I wants a hatchback.  I like the low profile of sedans, but I miss the ease-of-use of the hatch"
16-08-2020T23:52:22,AspiringNoodle,And civic hatchbacks looks :ok_hand:
16-08-2020T23:52:28,CrRAR,"Altimas have done AWD, Civics have to come out with that next"
16-08-2020T23:52:35,CrRAR,Yeah it‚Äôs pretty lit
16-08-2020T23:52:39,Dadrobit,"Rooster tailing, now that's a term I haven't heard in a good long while."
16-08-2020T23:53:22,CrRAR,"My brother and boss have the new civic, boss has hatchback"
16-08-2020T23:53:37,CrRAR,Hatchback is the way to go for functionality
16-08-2020T23:54:25,CrRAR,"It‚Äôs funny, the design was frumpy, but the accord crosstour was somewhat I feel the prototype for the New Civic"
16-08-2020T23:54:31,Dadrobit,Used to ride a lot in the dunes. Your measure of a man out there was determined by how big your rooster tail was lol.
16-08-2020T23:54:40,CrRAR,lol
16-08-2020T23:54:50,CrRAR,Roostertail for DAYS
16-08-2020T23:54:52,Dadrobit,"(also yes, hatchbacks are the bomb diggity)"
16-08-2020T23:55:08,Dadrobit,Lemme see if I can find a picture of my bike real quick.
16-08-2020T23:55:30,CrRAR,"Honda: ‚ÄúShrink it, make it cheaper, and TRENDY‚Äù"
16-08-2020T23:57:52,Dadrobit,Scoops for DAYS!

16-08-2020T23:58:24,Dadrobit,Ignore the dust. It's dusty
16-08-2020T23:58:41,Dadrobit,"Also, ignore the bike being borked."
16-08-2020T23:58:49,Dadrobit,It's borked
16-08-2020T23:59:00,CrRAR,lol
16-08-2020T23:59:12,CrRAR,Looks like something out of Mad Max
16-08-2020T23:59:26,Dadrobit,That's kinda my aesthetic
16-08-2020T23:59:45,AspiringNoodle,Dem some dirty b0is
16-08-2020T23:59:57,AspiringNoodle,But yeah... hatches are too damn convenient
