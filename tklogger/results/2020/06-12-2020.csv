06-12-2020T00:00:16,steelabjur,"Heh, pity it didn't fly, Clovis' expression alone would have been worth it alone."
06-12-2020T00:00:19,Ordithus,my earlier idea was... Laura. Sushi.

06-12-2020T00:03:05,Roughlandin,We can't seem to get a Laura sketch that doesn't have some kind of bondage reference lol
06-12-2020T00:03:22,SpazztasticKiwi,fur doesn‚Äôt do anything for me but that washboard was impressive
06-12-2020T00:04:02,steelabjur,"Like I said, he could grate cheese on that thing."
06-12-2020T00:04:06,Roughlandin,Girls I like either way. But for some reason only the fuzzy dudes do it for me
06-12-2020T00:04:19,Roughlandin,*Shrugs*
06-12-2020T00:04:24,SpazztasticKiwi,abs aren‚Äôt my preference but I can appreciate

06-12-2020T00:11:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"it‚Äôs like ginger billy points out in one of his videos, the best way to seduce a woman is not flowers, it‚Äôs doing the dishes"

06-12-2020T00:21:19,Roughlandin,I don't find him physically attractive. He's just adorable. I want to hug him and teach him how to read/use a hammer without hurting himself
06-12-2020T00:21:24,SpazztasticKiwi,"him, Mark, Se√°n, Tyler, Thomas and so on"
06-12-2020T00:21:30,Dadrobit,Just one fore damn thing to worry about man...
06-12-2020T00:21:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"I like them, they‚Äôre attractive but eh"

06-12-2020T00:26:38,SpazztasticKiwi,moot point
06-12-2020T00:26:42,Dadrobit,"I mean, it's pretty straightforward and overt copyright infringement, but if they're targeting talent on upwork, that means they're intentionally going after people who likely don't have the financial means to combat it."
06-12-2020T00:27:24,Roughlandin,Yeah they're going after VO newbies for free work
06-12-2020T00:28:53,steelabjur,Hate scummy companies
06-12-2020T00:29:24,Dadrobit,"Not just free, but 100% siphoned profit."
06-12-2020T00:31:36,Roughlandin,I'm watching a guy do tours of dead/dying shopping malls and I can't stop.

06-12-2020T00:35:08,AspiringNoodle,automation is killing the middle class :|
06-12-2020T00:35:22,AspiringNoodle,And the government and rich people don't want to deal with the fallout
06-12-2020T00:35:29,Ordithus,:rooster:
06-12-2020T00:35:57,Roughlandin,Ha I get it
06-12-2020T00:36:23,Ordithus,is that show still going?
06-12-2020T00:36:36,AspiringNoodle,"DUde, you have no freakin' idea, lmao"
06-12-2020T00:36:44,AspiringNoodle,You missed the ENTIRE Trump presidency arc
06-12-2020T00:36:56,Ordithus,"like the simpsons, I haven't watched it for like 10 years"
06-12-2020T00:37:10,AspiringNoodle,"do it man, it's so good~"
06-12-2020T00:37:17,SpazztasticKiwi,this gay couple on my fb page had a wild turkey in their yard
06-12-2020T00:37:18,AspiringNoodle,The animation is really top notch these days
06-12-2020T00:37:28,SpazztasticKiwi,his name is apparently herman
06-12-2020T00:37:53,steelabjur,I have deer all the time. I live in the middle of town.
06-12-2020T00:38:12,SpazztasticKiwi,cousin posted it‚Äôs 45 days till we lose number 45

06-12-2020T00:38:33,AspiringNoodle,I'm watching the court stuff go on
06-12-2020T00:38:49,steelabjur,spookybutt?
06-12-2020T00:38:53,AspiringNoodle,I'm wondering if we could actually see this so tied up in the legal process that the transistion is delayed
06-12-2020T00:38:59,Roughlandin,Nah
06-12-2020T00:39:10,Ordithus,"everything has been thrown out immediately, with prejudice"
06-12-2020T00:39:15,Ordithus,probably not
06-12-2020T00:39:21,steelabjur,"Nah, Trump's something like 41-1 court losses so far."
06-12-2020T00:40:24,Roughlandin,And the electoral college convenes tomorrow
06-12-2020T00:40:37,steelabjur,"Trump really has no leg to stand on, it's all performance for his rabid base."
06-12-2020T00:41:22,SpazztasticKiwi,no spooky butt
06-12-2020T00:41:26,Roughlandin,Aww
06-12-2020T00:41:42,AspiringNoodle,"Supreme Court is his goal, and it looks like he might be winning there"
06-12-2020T00:41:45,steelabjur,Again I say: Spooky butt?
06-12-2020T00:41:57,Dadrobit,The only thing that is keeping my hackles raised isn't the courts. It's the 90% of elected Republican House Reps and Senators that refuse to acknowledge Biden still.
06-12-2020T00:42:14,Roughlandin,They're just waiting to see how the ship sinks
06-12-2020T00:42:45,SpazztasticKiwi,he wants chaos and evidence to go down as a martyr in the eyes of his sheep that don‚Äôt research for themselves but instead rely and expect him to be tell imthe truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth
06-12-2020T00:42:58,steelabjur,"Pretty much, they don't want to lose their base by turning on the Pumpkin King."
06-12-2020T00:43:27,SpazztasticKiwi,spooky butt is a white butt deer where I live I saw once when it was a baby
06-12-2020T00:43:40,SpazztasticKiwi,years ago & is still around
06-12-2020T00:44:20,SpazztasticKiwi,that way they have a leg to stand on to whine it was stolen and he tried his best to combat the evil
06-12-2020T00:44:35,Ordithus,eeeeeevvvvvvviiiiiiiiilllllllllll
06-12-2020T00:44:41,steelabjur,"Trump is actually hurting them with his drumming on the ""election fraud"" shtick with the runoffs in Georgia."
06-12-2020T00:45:12,Roughlandin,Fluff stream done
06-12-2020T00:45:29,Roughlandin,Woof. Don't know how you guys do that. It gets kinda overwhelming
06-12-2020T00:45:42,Ordithus,do what?
06-12-2020T00:45:47,Roughlandin,flipping between tabs
06-12-2020T00:45:59,Ordithus,pop out chat
06-12-2020T00:46:21,Roughlandin,Oh. So that's what that button's for lol
06-12-2020T00:46:32,Roughlandin,And now I know
06-12-2020T00:47:02,steelabjur,"Local Repub politicians: ""VOTE!"", Trump: ""Voter fraud!"" Local Repubs: ""Why vote if the Dems are going to steal it?"""

06-12-2020T00:48:36,steelabjur,"""If I say it enough, it becomes true"" Trump, probably"
06-12-2020T00:50:13,Roughlandin,The last four years has to have been hard on GOP congress members. Waking up wanting one thing and then having to completely change directions based on whatever Trump tweeted today has to be taxing
06-12-2020T00:50:14,Dadrobit,And those fuckers are still destroying the AZ wildlife and environment at the border. They're not building fuck all. They're literally just clearing mass swaths of land for fucking nothing.
06-12-2020T00:50:38,SpazztasticKiwi,PhillyD has a shirt ‚Äúwhy bother with evidence  when you can use your facts as feelings‚Äù
06-12-2020T00:50:49,SpazztasticKiwi,something to that effect anyway
06-12-2020T00:50:51,Dadrobit,We have a shitload of endangered species and unique fauna/flora that's just being destroyed for literally nothing.

06-12-2020T00:51:31,Roughlandin,Blergh. I just hope stuff finally chills out a little in January
06-12-2020T00:51:31,Ordithus,I'm looking forward to having an adult in the white house. missed that.
06-12-2020T00:51:37,SpazztasticKiwi,same
06-12-2020T00:51:38,Roughlandin,Ditto
06-12-2020T00:51:42,SpazztasticKiwi,mood
06-12-2020T00:51:45,steelabjur,Hard agree!
06-12-2020T00:52:10,SpazztasticKiwi,did anybody here miss the trump vs biden rap battle
06-12-2020T00:52:20,Ordithus,Like... it was so weird having my niece and nephew... and thinking that the guy in the white house is just a huge embarassment
06-12-2020T00:52:20,Dadrobit,I think Vladimir Putin was in the White House a few times. Kinda hate that it counts.
06-12-2020T00:52:26,Ordithus,all the worst human qualities
06-12-2020T00:52:43,SpazztasticKiwi,I knew children better behaved
06-12-2020T00:52:52,SpazztasticKiwi,and with a better vocabulary
06-12-2020T00:52:52,steelabjur,I saw it a few times Kiwi.
06-12-2020T00:52:54,Ordithus,not a role model
06-12-2020T00:52:57,SpazztasticKiwi,and I don‚Äôt like kids
06-12-2020T00:53:03,SpazztasticKiwi,know
06-12-2020T00:53:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I have that video saved & still listen to it
06-12-2020T00:53:46,Roughlandin,At least a kid knows what it wants for more than a day sometimes
06-12-2020T00:53:47,SpazztasticKiwi,does jeff dunham ring a bell for anyone
06-12-2020T00:53:53,Dadrobit,"All else aside, I know he woke my ass up politically as well as my brother and a few coworkers."
06-12-2020T00:53:57,AspiringNoodle,"*sigh*, I wish Trump would just shut up.  Like all the time :|"

06-12-2020T00:54:34,Ordithus,dun-ham
06-12-2020T00:54:37,SpazztasticKiwi,he did a bit with ‚Äútrumps assistant‚Äù
06-12-2020T00:54:56,Dadrobit,"We were all apathetic before this, I made sure I got half a dozen other folks to vote in the last two elections. Feels good."
06-12-2020T00:54:58,SpazztasticKiwi,dude was a good representation of the sane people of America
06-12-2020T00:55:07,Roughlandin,I liked his stuff for a long time but then he had a special right after he got divorced that felt SUPER bitter and it kinda turned me off
06-12-2020T00:55:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I took my ass to the polls come hell or high water
06-12-2020T00:55:37,Roughlandin,I did an absentee ballot
06-12-2020T00:55:51,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve found I don‚Äôt like all his jokes but the assistant one is fun
06-12-2020T00:56:03,Roughlandin,Because I wasn't going to risk going down there with all the anti-mask nutjobs
06-12-2020T00:56:20,Dadrobit,AZ has been mail-in ballot friendly for forever now.
06-12-2020T00:56:27,Dadrobit,Thank fuck for that
06-12-2020T00:56:28,Ordithus,"decades, yeah?"
06-12-2020T00:56:56,steelabjur,I'm lucky to live in a state that has done mail-in ballots for years.
06-12-2020T00:57:06,Dadrobit,"Long as I've known at least, so at least a bit over a decade."
06-12-2020T00:57:21,Roughlandin,This is the loosest I've known Indiana to be
06-12-2020T00:58:04,Roughlandin,But every other time I wasn't very concerned about actually going to the polls
06-12-2020T00:58:27,Ordithus,my polling location is in my back yard
06-12-2020T00:58:40,Roughlandin,Mine is right down the street
06-12-2020T00:58:41,AspiringNoodle,Same-ish xD
06-12-2020T00:58:47,AspiringNoodle,It's not even 3 minutes away
06-12-2020T00:58:53,Ordithus,though this year it was the mailbox XD
06-12-2020T00:59:06,Dadrobit,"I feel super good about AZ this time around. We voted for recreational marijuana, a new tax on wealthy people, and got two D Senators."
06-12-2020T00:59:13,Ordithus,\o/
06-12-2020T00:59:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm still seeing people in their trump 2020 gear
06-12-2020T00:59:22,Dadrobit,"We got a lotta shit wrong elsewise, but this felt good."
06-12-2020T00:59:23,SpazztasticKiwi,& selling it
06-12-2020T00:59:37,Ordithus,someone down the street from me still has their lawn signs out
06-12-2020T00:59:41,Roughlandin,"Wish we could get some of that recreational vibe up here, Dad"
06-12-2020T01:00:05,steelabjur,We all but decriminalized drugs in Oregon.
06-12-2020T01:00:07,SpazztasticKiwi,my mother apparently likes him because apparently he‚Äôs anti abortion
06-12-2020T01:00:08,Dadrobit,"(Though on the MJ front, individual cities are blocking recreational sales outside of dispensaries)"
06-12-2020T01:00:24,Roughlandin,Not that I'm particularly big into the wacky tabaccy
06-12-2020T01:00:38,Dadrobit,"I guarantee you, Spazz, that man 100% has forced at least one woman to have an abortion."
06-12-2020T01:00:41,SpazztasticKiwi,"but she doesn‚Äôt vote because other than not liking to leave the house, she doesn‚Äôt think her vote does anything"
06-12-2020T01:00:57,Ordithus,"not interested in it, either. but sure don't want people going to jail over it"
06-12-2020T01:01:18,SpazztasticKiwi,my aunt was happy about the new weed laws
06-12-2020T01:01:35,AspiringNoodle,"That reminds me, Dadro, did asshat get voted out of office?"
06-12-2020T01:01:38,SpazztasticKiwi,"she thinks alcohol is worse, and her sister added cigarettes"
06-12-2020T01:01:40,steelabjur,"Trump spent his entire career bullshitting people, why would he stop?"
06-12-2020T01:02:04,Roughlandin,Yeah. Honestly most of the cops I know don't even like to bother filing paperwork for weed possession anymore
06-12-2020T01:02:12,Roughlandin,It's just more work for them
06-12-2020T01:02:25,Roughlandin,And it usually gets commuted down in court anyway
06-12-2020T01:02:32,Ordithus,I wouldn't feel good about throwing someone's life away over it
06-12-2020T01:02:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"weed, I can‚Äôt say I wouldn‚Äôt try but it‚Äôs probably likely I won‚Äôt because I don‚Äôt want it possibly messing with what I do take regularly"
06-12-2020T01:02:38,Dadrobit,"No, the judge did not get voted out. 70% retain or something along that. It was a longshot anyways, but I put my vote in at least."
06-12-2020T01:02:44,AspiringNoodle,damn
06-12-2020T01:02:54,SpazztasticKiwi,I watched the history of criminalizing weed yesterday
06-12-2020T01:03:21,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs all thanks to one guy that had a massive oak tree up his ass
06-12-2020T01:03:21,Roughlandin,All that grass and Jazz will ruin our children!
06-12-2020T01:03:31,Dadrobit,Reagan?
06-12-2020T01:03:36,Roughlandin,Him too
06-12-2020T01:03:44,SpazztasticKiwi,I forgot his name actually but not him
06-12-2020T01:04:16,AspiringNoodle,"Can guarantee Republicans are either in big pharma's pocket or still believe a bunch of BS regarding what weed does and how ""unsafe"" it is"
06-12-2020T01:04:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"he blamed it on ‚ÄúMexicans, Hispanics, Latinos, and blacks...and jazz‚Äù"
06-12-2020T01:04:23,steelabjur,"Now in Oregon, if you get caught with anything, it's like $100 fine and mandated rehab (covered by weed tax)."
06-12-2020T01:04:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"here, you‚Äôre in trouble if you get caught"
06-12-2020T01:04:47,Roughlandin,"Eh, most younger republicans I know don't care about weed either"
06-12-2020T01:04:47,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt know how much trouble
06-12-2020T01:05:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I do know I have a guy I know that‚Äôs asked me to come over twice now if I want to try
06-12-2020T01:05:20,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm not stupid
06-12-2020T01:05:22,AspiringNoodle,"My father is pretty solid R, and even he wants weed legalized"
06-12-2020T01:05:26,Ordithus,I don't think I know anyone who still wants weed to be criminalized
06-12-2020T01:05:27,SpazztasticKiwi,"young, but not stupid"
06-12-2020T01:05:37,Ordithus,it's one of the most popular things in the country
06-12-2020T01:05:43,SpazztasticKiwi,"ord, I‚Äôve yet to ask but my mother might"
06-12-2020T01:05:51,Dadrobit,"Spazz, if anything gets documented on a legal record, that shit is bad news bears for the rest of your life if you don't move to a place that accepts it."
06-12-2020T01:05:53,AspiringNoodle,I think it's something like even 60% of republicans want weed legalized
06-12-2020T01:06:00,steelabjur,"Legalize it, tax it. It's good income."
06-12-2020T01:06:08,AspiringNoodle,^
06-12-2020T01:06:08,Dadrobit,"Even of you don't go to prison, having a criminal record at all is Hell."
06-12-2020T01:06:11,Roughlandin,Most people have realized it's really nothing to get worked up about
06-12-2020T01:06:25,AspiringNoodle,"If weed gets legalized, that's:"
06-12-2020T01:06:26,SpazztasticKiwi,aside from the fact I knew this guy likes me and I don‚Äôt play peekaboo with laws like that?
06-12-2020T01:06:31,SpazztasticKiwi,duh
06-12-2020T01:06:38,Dadrobit,That's how they passed it in AZ. The taxes go to education funding. \o/
06-12-2020T01:06:39,AspiringNoodle,"Less people in prison, wasting resources on the criminal justice system"
06-12-2020T01:06:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"also, don‚Äôt want to risk any issues with my meds"
06-12-2020T01:06:49,AspiringNoodle,Less resources spent on enforcing meaningless laws
06-12-2020T01:06:59,AspiringNoodle,"Less peoples lives ruined by ""drug"" charges"
06-12-2020T01:07:10,SpazztasticKiwi,which in reality I can‚Äôt imagine there being a problem but I‚Äôm not a dr
06-12-2020T01:07:12,AspiringNoodle,More jobs as people grow / sell weed
06-12-2020T01:07:18,AspiringNoodle,More tax income :)
06-12-2020T01:07:44,Roughlandin,That's another reason to legalize. Allow for more medical research so we can find out how it interacts with other meds
06-12-2020T01:07:53,SpazztasticKiwi,the guy has a criminal record - he‚Äôs on probation now if I remember right
06-12-2020T01:08:00,Roughlandin,Or maybe find an alternative to opioids
06-12-2020T01:08:14,AspiringNoodle,"HA, big pharma will never get on board with that"
06-12-2020T01:08:28,Roughlandin,Eh you'd be surprised
06-12-2020T01:08:31,AspiringNoodle,Did you see that story about a consulting firm recommending purdue pharma actually give REBATES for OD's?
06-12-2020T01:08:31,steelabjur,"Yeah, that doesn't sound like the type I'd want to smoke with too."
06-12-2020T01:08:43,SpazztasticKiwi,but he‚Äôs telling me he‚Äôs got some and he still drinks despite the requirement he do some counciling or whatever
06-12-2020T01:09:03,SpazztasticKiwi,"he can be an idiot, I‚Äôll pass"
06-12-2020T01:09:03,Roughlandin,I was doing a research project on the first canabinoid drug approved by the FDA when I... flunked out of pharmacy school
06-12-2020T01:09:22,AspiringNoodle,You didn't flunk out
06-12-2020T01:09:28,AspiringNoodle,They didn't want you going pro weed D:<
06-12-2020T01:09:38,steelabjur,"I mean, I haven't smoked in 20+ years, but that's throwing up all sorts of red flags."
06-12-2020T01:09:54,SpazztasticKiwi,honey you don‚Äôt know the half of it with this guy
06-12-2020T01:09:55,Roughlandin,Oh no. I had a mental breakdown from overstress and flunked hard
06-12-2020T01:10:15,SpazztasticKiwi,dadro has said the same and more and he knows more
06-12-2020T01:10:22,SpazztasticKiwi,I went over it awhile ago
06-12-2020T01:10:51,AspiringNoodle,I have a coworker who did time for DUI related stuff.  He is stone-cold sober :|
06-12-2020T01:11:13,AspiringNoodle,Sounds like your coworker needs a wakeup call if he got in trouble and STILL won't give the shit up
06-12-2020T01:11:27,steelabjur,"Ouch. I had a major depressive episode and flunked out of college, so I know that feeling, Rough."
06-12-2020T01:11:36,SpazztasticKiwi,he doesn‚Äôt work at walmart with me anymore
06-12-2020T01:11:44,Roughlandin,Yeah. Honestly it was for the best. Pharmacy was not for me.
06-12-2020T01:11:44,SpazztasticKiwi,hasn‚Äôt for a year at least now
06-12-2020T01:11:48,AspiringNoodle,quit or fired? xD
06-12-2020T01:11:54,SpazztasticKiwi,but we worked together for a spell
06-12-2020T01:12:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"fired after missing too many days and to his credit, his childhood epilepsy had returned"
06-12-2020T01:12:30,Ordithus,dang
06-12-2020T01:12:44,SpazztasticKiwi,so not fully his fault yet he still does things he ‚Äúknows‚Äù isn‚Äôt helping
06-12-2020T01:13:10,Roughlandin,Sometimes people with epilepic conditions do that sort of stuff to self-medicate
06-12-2020T01:13:15,AspiringNoodle,Well that changes things
06-12-2020T01:13:50,SpazztasticKiwi,"I‚Äôve suggested he start taking some responsibility by stopping the stupid habits, try a therapist, talk to friends"
06-12-2020T01:14:20,Roughlandin,"You can't make somebody help themselves, unfortunately"
06-12-2020T01:14:29,SpazztasticKiwi,reconnect with some of his family he‚Äôs got commenting on his fb posts...
06-12-2020T01:14:31,SpazztasticKiwi,but it seems I was the only friend he was really talking to
06-12-2020T01:14:50,Roughlandin,"Like I said, it took me flunking out of grad school to finally start focusing on my mental health"
06-12-2020T01:15:02,SpazztasticKiwi,he obviously needs help but he‚Äôs definitely going the wrong way about it
06-12-2020T01:15:36,SpazztasticKiwi,and I can‚Äôt help him with that yet he‚Äôs thinly suggested things
06-12-2020T01:16:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"I don‚Äôt interact with him except for pleasantries if I see him in town, esp since covid and him moving jobs"
06-12-2020T01:17:34,Roughlandin,You can lead a horse to water but they have to take the drink
06-12-2020T01:17:51,SpazztasticKiwi,hopefully something clicks but that‚Äôs his business at this point
06-12-2020T01:18:06,Roughlandin,Hopefully
06-12-2020T01:18:11,SpazztasticKiwi,I can‚Äôt mother a 26 year old and I‚Äôm not really going to try to
06-12-2020T01:18:33,Roughlandin,You shouldn't have to

06-12-2020T01:20:13,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs not tomorrow until I‚Äôve had a sleep cycle
