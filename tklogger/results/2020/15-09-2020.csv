15-09-2020T00:02:30,SpazztasticKiwi,guy I know thinks he ‚Äúneeds‚Äù a girlfriend
15-09-2020T00:04:54,SpazztasticKiwi,he thinks it‚Äôll help his depression to ‚Äúget a female‚Äù
15-09-2020T00:05:02,SpazztasticKiwi,yes he legit said female
15-09-2020T00:05:11,SpazztasticKiwi,somebody translate
15-09-2020T00:05:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt know ‚Äúguy‚Äù
15-09-2020T00:05:58,AspiringNoodle,Methinks his logic is messed up.  That and he isn't interested in LGBT
15-09-2020T00:06:17,AspiringNoodle,best guess I got
15-09-2020T00:06:25,SpazztasticKiwi,...well he‚Äôs straight
15-09-2020T00:06:41,SpazztasticKiwi,where‚Äôs the lgbt factor in any of that
15-09-2020T00:07:00,SpazztasticKiwi,& I gathered his logic was messed up
15-09-2020T00:07:49,Dadrobit,Dude's an incel. Avoid him.
15-09-2020T00:08:14,AspiringNoodle,"""get a female"" implies ""no trans applicants plz"""
15-09-2020T00:08:28,AspiringNoodle,If everything else is to be believed
15-09-2020T00:09:33,AspiringNoodle,"Unless he's using ""female"" as a synonym for ""girlfriend"", at which point my take on his statements is incorrect"
15-09-2020T00:10:17,AspiringNoodle,But what Dadro said.  Dude's probably got issues he needs to work on and is best avoided...
15-09-2020T00:12:01,Dadrobit,"The specification of ""female"" is a common tactic of incels to assess things with a faux clinical approach. Like there's a deeps seated scientific reason for why women aren't into him in a way that is impossible to overcome."
15-09-2020T00:12:49,AspiringNoodle,Yeesh...
15-09-2020T00:13:29,Dadrobit,"Depression itself shows there's something unfortunate happening up top, and his insistence on ""needing"" implies something akin to rightous ownership."
15-09-2020T00:14:28,SpazztasticKiwi,he‚Äôs been in a bad state for a little over a year
15-09-2020T00:14:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I used to work with him at walmart
15-09-2020T00:15:31,SpazztasticKiwi,"but as I‚Äôve tried to get across the occasional advice to him, this seems to be his answer"
15-09-2020T00:15:52,SpazztasticKiwi,he‚Äôs already shot his shot with me
15-09-2020T00:16:37,Dadrobit,"If he's reaching out to you with this kind of terminology, that's what we in the biz call ""giant fucking red flags"""
15-09-2020T00:16:51,Dadrobit,"Sty the fuck away, no joke."
15-09-2020T00:16:55,Dadrobit,Stay*
15-09-2020T00:17:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I know he liked me at least at one point
15-09-2020T00:18:54,SpazztasticKiwi,but since he‚Äôd pulled off from flirtatious to regular if not the occasional wild conversation I‚Äôve generally let it go
15-09-2020T00:19:34,SpazztasticKiwi,he told me he did try asking another girl out last we talked but she was taken
15-09-2020T00:20:13,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm not excited for him or depressed for him
15-09-2020T00:21:09,SpazztasticKiwi,since his ‚Äúproposal‚Äù my interest went down in flames for anything past casual  acquaintance
15-09-2020T00:30:26,SpazztasticKiwi,but I‚Äôd also allow it‚Äôs not impossible he still thinks there‚Äôs a chance if he‚Äôs patient
15-09-2020T00:46:16,Dadrobit,In happier news. Have a puppy who attacks audio gear.

15-09-2020T00:47:58,SpazztasticKiwi,like the dog ate a car or something
15-09-2020T00:49:41,SpazztasticKiwi,have you seen the corgi puppy that got into the red jam

15-09-2020T01:20:16,SpazztasticKiwi,that sounds like something you take medicine to get rid of
15-09-2020T01:25:50,SpazztasticKiwi,oh it might be funny to mention kiwi tried jumping on the bed today

15-09-2020T01:43:29,SpazztasticKiwi,is extra pickles and mayo gross
15-09-2020T01:58:31,Dadrobit,I'm not a fan of pickles to begin with.
15-09-2020T01:58:58,Dadrobit,"On a cheeseburger a few is alright, but that's about it."
15-09-2020T02:00:03,AspiringNoodle,"I find it funny.  I love salty foods, but can't stand pickles (they're too dang salty)"
15-09-2020T02:00:21,AspiringNoodle,But the same people who complain about how salty the foods I love are the same ones who will chow down on pickles left and right.
15-09-2020T02:06:14,SpazztasticKiwi,...pickles are vinegary

15-09-2020T18:28:05,Ordithus,younger Nora is about as adorable as Reni
15-09-2020T18:29:06,CrRAR,"I like how Nora's coming down off a hill/mountain, I think the dragons are known to hail from some high place"
15-09-2020T18:29:27,CrRAR,Like that unexplained dragon statue thing we see occasionally
15-09-2020T18:29:35,CrRAR,"I guess, or caves"
15-09-2020T18:30:13,CrRAR,but the statue thing seems like a PoI.
15-09-2020T18:33:27,CrRAR,Like Nora probably just decided to take a stroll one day a bit further than usual.

15-09-2020T20:39:50,CrRAR,mushrooms too
15-09-2020T20:40:25,CrRAR,I would have saved the waffles for dessert and ate em with ice cream
15-09-2020T20:40:52,CrRAR,But waffles are the best comfort food
15-09-2020T20:41:14,Ordithus,waffles and chicken is a southern thing isn't it?
15-09-2020T20:41:15,CrRAR,I guess you‚Äôre on the right track w/ chicken n waffles
15-09-2020T20:41:23,CrRAR,yus

15-09-2020T20:57:41,AspiringNoodle,I wish Kiwi was here
15-09-2020T20:58:16,AspiringNoodle,Watching an r/AmITheA--hole? vid on youtube.  First one gets right down to it. Southern culture is garbage xD
15-09-2020T20:58:52,CrRAR,*banjo intensifies*
15-09-2020T20:59:27,AspiringNoodle,"So the background is that the mother is from the northeastern US, and the father is from the South.  They lived in the south for 8 years but ultimately moved back up north for work"
15-09-2020T21:00:09,AspiringNoodle,"When his family arrives, they are super rude, arrogant, and condescending.  Talking about how their culture ""gets it right"", and that she's doing everything ""wrong"" by not taking care of the kid, serving her husband before her, etc."
15-09-2020T21:00:40,AspiringNoodle,"Mentioning a bunch of other aspects of Southern culture that do not apply because they live in rented condos atm, so they can't do their ""half"" as assigned by Southern culture"
15-09-2020T21:01:30,CrRAR,"Yeah, the south has better quality of life and is hella laid back but sadly all high paying jobs are in the north, but everything is proportionately more expensive"
15-09-2020T21:01:45,CrRAR,The phenomenon you‚Äôre describing is quite common
15-09-2020T21:01:54,AspiringNoodle,"Husband is embarassed because she made him look bad, and when she calls him out on the garbage-ness of Southern culture, he comes back with that all cultures are valid and that she needs to respect his culture."
15-09-2020T21:02:05,AspiringNoodle,"Ironic, since he's refusing to respect her culture."
15-09-2020T21:03:15,AspiringNoodle,"But yeah... first story, and I immediately think of Kiwi"
15-09-2020T21:03:57,CrRAR,Yeah southern pride is one of those things like that ‚Äúdon‚Äôt tread on me‚Äù saying/bumper sticker
15-09-2020T21:04:13,CrRAR,It‚Äôs a way of life
15-09-2020T21:08:58,CrRAR,"Though I guess north/south is generalizing a bit, it‚Äôs really more rural vs metropolitan."
15-09-2020T21:10:11,CrRAR,"...and to be honest it‚Äôs not completely a rosy story at the far end of the urban/economic power house spectrum like what‚Äôs happeing in Cali, lots of people and businesses are fleeing to Texas"
15-09-2020T21:10:28,CrRAR,too expensive
15-09-2020T21:11:09,CrRAR,"Living life there is like living in space, top of your game and usually only for so long unless you‚Äôve just been there forever"
