16-11-2020T15:35:09,CrRAR,There's folks that can be chronic cigarette bummers
16-11-2020T15:35:35,CrRAR,"like never buy their own, just grift."
16-11-2020T15:38:51,CrRAR,"Also, between smokers, if ya share a cigarette ya probably also hang around to have a conversation. It's like social code."
16-11-2020T15:39:04,CrRAR,"""shoot the shit"" as they say."

16-11-2020T16:19:12,CrRAR,yup
16-11-2020T16:19:27,CrRAR,maybe was just a test flight
16-11-2020T16:19:32,CrimsonQuill,I don't think Picarto tested this properly before they made it...
16-11-2020T16:19:48,CrRAR,nope
16-11-2020T16:19:51,CrimsonQuill,I got a big announcement saying that this was the 'new' picarto and whatnot
16-11-2020T16:20:05,CrimsonQuill,It looks the same as half a dozen other sites with that look.
16-11-2020T16:20:15,CrRAR,yeah they were working on it for like a year already
