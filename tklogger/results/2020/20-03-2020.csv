20-03-2020T00:26:07,Ordithus,manos the hands of fate
20-03-2020T00:26:48,SpazztasticKiwi,that sounds like a bootleg hero origin story
20-03-2020T00:27:00,SageSaga,it's a classic- horrible movie
20-03-2020T00:27:16,Ordithus,it was on the original mystery science theater 3000
20-03-2020T00:27:21,Ordithus,They... couldn't do it
20-03-2020T00:30:00,SpazztasticKiwi,you two cleared nothing for me up in those sentences
20-03-2020T00:31:09,Ordithus,"Here you go, kiwi, Manos on imdb https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060666/"
20-03-2020T00:31:37,KeefMcDerpface,1966?!
20-03-2020T00:31:55,RimaDraws,so anyone know where mihari is?
20-03-2020T00:32:18,SageSaga,well my guess is either sleeping or dealing with the kids and their nonsense
20-03-2020T00:32:27,ZRO4825,Doin cheetah mom things.
20-03-2020T00:32:36,RimaDraws,wait what
20-03-2020T00:32:41,RimaDraws,she got kid
20-03-2020T00:32:44,SageSaga,she caught em at 4am playing on their tablets
20-03-2020T00:32:49,RimaDraws,that is new to me
20-03-2020T00:32:56,ZRO4825,Ruh roh. Kids in trouble. :V
20-03-2020T00:33:09,SageSaga,she has a kid- but she also has her sisters kids because her sister - is not a good mother :D
20-03-2020T00:33:40,RimaDraws,awww
20-03-2020T00:33:50,RimaDraws,well damn didnt know lady cheetah was mom
20-03-2020T00:34:14,SageSaga,yep
20-03-2020T00:34:46,RimaDraws,well shoot. learn something new everyday
20-03-2020T00:35:44,SageSaga,she was also up till at least 9am without sleep- probably just decided to not sleep and thus- is probably konked out now
20-03-2020T00:36:30,SageSaga,i said goodnight to her at 8:30am and i didnt get to sleep till 9:30ish and i think she was still online
20-03-2020T00:36:38,ZRO4825,:c
20-03-2020T00:36:44,RimaDraws,poor thing
20-03-2020T00:37:45,SageSaga,i just hope her sister doesnt go out - get the virus - and bring it back to the house
20-03-2020T00:39:16,SageSaga,seems like something she would do though
20-03-2020T00:39:21,Ordithus,that would be awful
20-03-2020T00:39:39,RimaDraws,oh my
20-03-2020T00:40:32,SageSaga,shes one of those people that doesnt really care about anyone but herself-  so i dont expect her to understand social distancing
20-03-2020T00:43:11,AspiringNoodle,"I read an article yesterday that was the epitome of the ""okay boomer"" meme"
20-03-2020T00:43:41,AspiringNoodle,Lots of working adults with older parents who basically gave the coronavirus zero respect
20-03-2020T00:44:28,KeefMcDerpface,Are you talking about Italy or in general?
20-03-2020T00:45:03,SpazztasticKiwi,you ever wanna say something that if you didn’t you feel your head will burst but socially it would rub off as “”mean””
20-03-2020T00:45:42,AspiringNoodle,American Seniors
20-03-2020T00:45:46,SpazztasticKiwi,I found a documentary to watch nm
20-03-2020T00:45:55,KeefMcDerpface,Okay Kiwi
20-03-2020T00:46:18,AspiringNoodle,"The article was discussing the plight of the author, as well as other adults who had contacted them while writing this article"
20-03-2020T00:46:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Sage how are you in here while being live but not multistreaming with Tom
20-03-2020T00:47:08,AspiringNoodle,"Basically as the coronavirus was ramping up, and well into being mainstream news, seniors were doing things like dining regularly, planning on seeing theatre shows, having dinner parties, going on cruises, etc"
20-03-2020T00:47:21,AspiringNoodle,"And in some cases, the only reason they didn't go through with the plans was because the venues closed down."
20-03-2020T00:47:24,SageSaga,wut?
20-03-2020T00:47:33,SageSaga,i am
20-03-2020T00:47:50,SpazztasticKiwi,"you’re in Toms chat, but while you’re live and he’s not anymore, you are live"
20-03-2020T00:48:03,SageSaga,the multistream is still on
20-03-2020T00:48:05,AspiringNoodle,^

20-03-2020T00:50:14,SageSaga,you can probably guess what it says
20-03-2020T00:51:01,sunblaze,I am fine thank you :D I worry more about you and the infamous US-healthcare
20-03-2020T00:51:30,SageSaga,<_< yeeeeeeah

20-03-2020T00:51:42,SageSaga,well most of us
20-03-2020T00:51:45,SageSaga,the rich will be fine!
20-03-2020T00:51:53,SageSaga,they can buy their own tests apparently!
20-03-2020T00:51:56,sunblaze,but for the scetch which of your chars is the most happy/funny?
20-03-2020T00:52:24,AspiringNoodle,Solving the healthcare issue is gonna be a tough one
20-03-2020T00:52:55,SageSaga,hmmm - Toyoko is kinda always happy- Kaylin is usually pretty happy when shes not thinking about her situation -
20-03-2020T00:53:45,ZRO4825,Toyoko! \[T]/
20-03-2020T00:54:00,sunblaze,ohhh toyoko is a good idea. then a cheering toyoko please!
20-03-2020T00:54:14,sunblaze,to cheer away the dark/grim situation
20-03-2020T00:59:18,Ordithus,Eyelids grow heavy
20-03-2020T00:59:26,KeefMcDerpface,same
20-03-2020T00:59:35,Ordithus,Goodnight! :ctwokinds-RainezZz:

20-03-2020T00:59:45,SageSaga,gnight Ord!
20-03-2020T00:59:49,SageSaga,rest well!
20-03-2020T01:01:47,SageSaga,so- once the 16 days are up- and everyone gets tested- everyone who has had it or been in contact with it has to wear something to let everyone know to stay away- wait- nope- already sounding like a Nazi plan- new plan-
20-03-2020T01:02:27,SageSaga,"sorry- was just reading a thing and thinking ""wow- I think some people are going to have an issue with that"""
20-03-2020T01:02:52,ZRO4825,lol
20-03-2020T01:03:53,KeefMcDerpface,"""So what's the new plan sir? Mark their homes with a bio-hazard sign?"""
20-03-2020T01:03:55,SageSaga,"tbh though i can totally see Trump saying ""They will have to wear something- like a gold star, so people know ""stay away from this person"" and once they are clear they can take it off-"""
20-03-2020T01:05:07,SageSaga,"And Bernie would be like "" . . . TRUUUUUMPPP!!!! HE HAS TO KNOW HES DOING THIS!"""
20-03-2020T01:05:37,SageSaga,"and Biden would be like ""Nah man, he's just... really really dumb"""
20-03-2020T01:06:36,KeefMcDerpface,*Slowly walks away from Sage for he has a gold star in front of his name.*
20-03-2020T01:07:23,SageSaga,That's anti semitic
20-03-2020T01:07:28,SageSaga,shame
20-03-2020T01:07:48,KeefMcDerpface,:ptv-sad: I know.
20-03-2020T01:09:25,unsteddyphoenix,Pretty sure it'd be the other way around
20-03-2020T01:09:39,unsteddyphoenix,"Since Bidens whole platform is ""gotta beat trump"""
20-03-2020T01:09:41,SageSaga,"hmm ya know- i would breath such a relief if Trump lost the next election by a landslide and come to this realization ""Wow- people really just hated Hillary"" XD"
20-03-2020T01:10:14,sunblaze,one can only hope
20-03-2020T01:10:15,ZRO4825,"I mean, that was the majority reason behind why I preferred him. Not cuz he wasn't a bad idea. Just because he was the less bad idea of the two, imo."
20-03-2020T01:10:24,SageSaga,Bernie has been all about beating trump too- and Bernie is Jewish so-
20-03-2020T01:11:00,unsteddyphoenix,I feel like he's been more about like. Healthcare or whatever?
20-03-2020T01:11:31,SageSaga,"thats his big policy thing- but no hes been championing the ""beating trump"" message too"
20-03-2020T01:12:14,AspiringNoodle,"Sadly, 2020 is looking to be a repeat"
20-03-2020T01:12:25,unsteddyphoenix,Lol. They dont understand that by putting him on a pedastal they make him look more powerful
20-03-2020T01:12:25,SageSaga,"man- i wonder if Hillary could have turned some people around if she said ""I want to support big tiddy anime girls!"""
20-03-2020T01:12:40,unsteddyphoenix,She needed better memes
20-03-2020T01:12:48,unsteddyphoenix,Gotta hire some zoomers on instagram to make them for her
20-03-2020T01:12:48,AspiringNoodle,Nope.  I only supported Bernie :P
20-03-2020T01:12:55,AspiringNoodle,"In 2016, I was a Bernie Bro"
20-03-2020T01:12:58,AspiringNoodle,"2020, Yang Gang"
20-03-2020T01:13:11,AspiringNoodle,Also Tulsi Gabbard
20-03-2020T01:13:20,SageSaga,=_= Bernie or Bust is like the dumbest thing
20-03-2020T01:13:41,SageSaga,"""if we cant have bernie- burn it all"" ""Dude... we still live here"""
20-03-2020T01:14:20,AspiringNoodle,I don't like the idea of political families
20-03-2020T01:14:29,SageSaga,i get that
20-03-2020T01:15:04,AspiringNoodle,"For example, Trump Jr. runs for elections in say 2024? AND he's super moderate? I'll be VERY conflicted and equally hesitant to vote"
20-03-2020T01:16:08,SageSaga,i havent seen anything hes done thats proven him to be a capable leader- ive seen tons of stuff hes done that makes me against him though
20-03-2020T01:16:55,SageSaga,Trumps just a con man though- he'll say whatever he wants to get people to side with or agree with him and change it later to suit his needs
20-03-2020T01:18:05,SageSaga,plus side though- Public opinion on Healthcare has actually been shifting finally
20-03-2020T01:18:29,AspiringNoodle,"Sometimes I wonder, lol.  He does seem good at misdirection"
20-03-2020T01:19:11,SageSaga,he would be if it werent for video of him saying things and then saying he didnt say that so often
20-03-2020T01:19:49,AspiringNoodle,"When it comes to misdirection, I like pointing out his appointment of federal circuit judges"
20-03-2020T01:20:57,AspiringNoodle,I don't know if many people know that trump has appointed over 180 federal circuit judges.  Roughly a quarter.  He's started flipping some more liberal circuits to conservative as a result.
20-03-2020T01:21:47,AspiringNoodle,"Kinda shocked me when I found out.  Total ""Wow..."" moment"
20-03-2020T01:22:22,SageSaga,dont most presidents do that though?
20-03-2020T01:23:23,AspiringNoodle,"Yeah, but you think the media would be all over Trump flipping the 9th circuit"
20-03-2020T01:23:31,AspiringNoodle,THE 9th circuit
20-03-2020T01:24:02,SageSaga,yeah but do you think hes causing all these other gaffs and flubs and errors to hide it?
20-03-2020T01:24:16,AspiringNoodle,Possibly.
20-03-2020T01:24:20,SageSaga,or do you think its more likely that people dont care because they get changed all the time anyways
20-03-2020T01:24:54,AspiringNoodle,"Well, considering the 9th circuit is the one that has opposed his administration consistently, I would imagine more people would be concerned"
20-03-2020T01:25:14,SageSaga,the only one they do care about is the Supreme court because they cant just be removed and replaced
20-03-2020T01:25:43,AspiringNoodle,I don't care if I'm for or against a president
20-03-2020T01:26:01,AspiringNoodle,But having a single president appoint a 1/3 of the Supreme Court is a bit unnerving
20-03-2020T01:26:12,SageSaga,yeah
20-03-2020T01:26:21,SageSaga,i kinda wish it wasnt up to a president
20-03-2020T01:26:30,AspiringNoodle,"Out of principle, I tell Ruth to LIVE DAMMIT, LIIIIIIIIIVE!!!"
20-03-2020T01:27:05,unsteddyphoenix,"Quick swerve but, any anime recommendations sage?"
20-03-2020T01:27:10,SageSaga,yes
20-03-2020T01:27:30,SageSaga,what are you interested in?
20-03-2020T01:29:45,unsteddyphoenix,Mmm Whats a recent favourite of yours? Whenever I watch what you mention I generally have a good time
20-03-2020T01:30:45,SageSaga,hmm
20-03-2020T01:31:23,SageSaga,do you want something long or normal-anime? XD
20-03-2020T01:32:48,SageSaga,if you want something long and havent seen it yet- Black Clover is a mix of terrible and amazing
20-03-2020T01:32:50,unsteddyphoenix,Long as in episode duration? I prefer the regular sized anime chunks for my decrepid attention span
20-03-2020T01:32:59,unsteddyphoenix,"But if you mean long as in number of episodes, long is better"
20-03-2020T01:33:45,SageSaga,"Black Clover actually takes a while to find it's pace and suffers from ""This is Naruto but with Wizards and their Naruto is way more annoying"""
20-03-2020T01:34:01,SageSaga,but once it finds its pacing is VERY fast paced and fun
20-03-2020T01:34:12,unsteddyphoenix,"A more annoying Naruto, very impressive"
20-03-2020T01:34:26,SageSaga,like those 10 episodes of training to become powerful- yeah they skip that totally and go from bad guy to badguy
20-03-2020T01:34:36,SageSaga,the animation suffers for it in many places too
20-03-2020T01:34:49,SageSaga,but when they hit an important section- it's amazing
20-03-2020T01:35:01,unsteddyphoenix,"Only bossfights, I like that."
20-03-2020T01:35:18,SageSaga,its got some filler- but it's mostly harmless
20-03-2020T01:35:24,unsteddyphoenix,I'll give that a go ty. Think ive heard of it before.
20-03-2020T01:35:28,unsteddyphoenix,Is there a beach episode?
20-03-2020T01:35:32,SageSaga,yes
20-03-2020T01:35:36,SageSaga,sorta
20-03-2020T01:35:37,unsteddyphoenix,Nice im in
20-03-2020T01:35:41,AspiringNoodle,"I swear, I'm gonna call that OPM animation xD"
20-03-2020T01:35:54,AspiringNoodle,lower framerate animation for general scenes
20-03-2020T01:36:06,AspiringNoodle,increased framerate / detail for the GUD STUFF!!!
20-03-2020T01:36:14,SageSaga,it's called Sakuga
20-03-2020T01:36:39,SageSaga,Sakuga is the action animation that anime is known for
20-03-2020T01:36:46,AspiringNoodle,Love it~
20-03-2020T01:36:55,AspiringNoodle,Thanks for teaching me that :ptv-hearts:
20-03-2020T01:37:01,SageSaga,another must watch show is Mob Psycho 100
20-03-2020T01:37:14,SageSaga,both seasons
20-03-2020T01:37:23,unsteddyphoenix,"Seen that one, was a great time"
20-03-2020T01:37:34,SageSaga,a Shonen series that a lot of people have missed is Radiant
20-03-2020T01:37:43,unsteddyphoenix,HIs boss is such alegend
20-03-2020T01:37:44,SageSaga,it has 2 seasons- season 2 was reeeeally good
20-03-2020T01:38:20,SageSaga,"Radiant also kinda suffers a bit from the ""ah its another wizard/ninja thing"" but theres so much more to it"
20-03-2020T01:38:30,AspiringNoodle,"steddy, do you like crying? c:"
20-03-2020T01:38:37,SageSaga,and the animation overall is good quality
20-03-2020T01:39:22,SageSaga,new anime that recently finished season 1- Welcome to Demon School! Iruma!
20-03-2020T01:39:36,SageSaga,it's cute- it's fun
20-03-2020T01:40:08,SageSaga,but if you want something more hard hitting and with a supernatural twist- In/Spectre is pretty sweet
20-03-2020T01:40:15,unsteddyphoenix,Ahhh...I started watching that but...I dont think I can handle the main character
20-03-2020T01:40:18,unsteddyphoenix,Demon school that is
20-03-2020T01:40:39,unsteddyphoenix,I love in/spectre so far
20-03-2020T01:40:41,unsteddyphoenix,Really good
20-03-2020T01:40:57,SageSaga,"a man seen as a monster by monsters, and a girl that lost her eye and one of her legs to become the goddess of knowledge to the monsters and spirits of the world"
20-03-2020T01:41:48,TheBeckoner,It's called in/Spectre?
20-03-2020T01:41:53,SageSaga,yep
20-03-2020T01:42:10,TheBeckoner,"Huh sounds neat, gonna have to look it up"
20-03-2020T01:42:28,SageSaga,infinite dendrogram - guy playing a full Dive VR RPG in a world of infinite adventure
20-03-2020T01:43:03,SageSaga,Bofuri - a girl playing a VR RPG game- doesnt wanna get hurt though so she maxes out her defense stat- breaks the game
20-03-2020T01:43:18,SageSaga,cute comedy action series
20-03-2020T01:43:51,TheBeckoner,Harden - the anime
20-03-2020T01:43:59,KeefMcDerpface,"Well, I'm going to bed. Night all."
20-03-2020T01:44:08,SageSaga,gnight
20-03-2020T01:44:11,unsteddyphoenix,Vr animes huh. Interestin
20-03-2020T01:44:30,AspiringNoodle,"Dangit... looks like I'll need to either keep my sub to Hulu, or sub to funimation xD"
20-03-2020T01:46:52,AspiringNoodle,"steddy, I also have some suggestions, though you may have seen them already"
20-03-2020T01:47:03,AspiringNoodle,But I also respect if you don't want to hear them
20-03-2020T01:47:47,unsteddyphoenix,I think Sage has me covered with all those lol. Save 'em 'til I ask again or i'll forget
20-03-2020T01:48:09,SageSaga,have you seen Detective Conan? it's over 960 episodes-
20-03-2020T01:49:08,unsteddyphoenix,Mmmm i'll pass on that one
20-03-2020T01:49:10,SageSaga,it will take you legit 2 weeks to watch it all
20-03-2020T01:49:14,unsteddyphoenix,Have YOU?
20-03-2020T01:49:15,SageSaga,no sleeping
20-03-2020T01:49:23,SageSaga,ive seen it all yes
20-03-2020T01:49:33,unsteddyphoenix,Jesus. Was it worth it?
20-03-2020T01:49:34,SpazztasticKiwi,kbednow
20-03-2020T01:49:38,unsteddyphoenix,o/
20-03-2020T01:49:43,TheBeckoner,Night kiwi
20-03-2020T01:49:44,SageSaga,14.6 days of anime right there
20-03-2020T01:49:59,SageSaga,ive been watching it for a long time though XD
20-03-2020T01:50:11,SageSaga,it's a great series
20-03-2020T01:50:51,SageSaga,its just- also not really a normal series- it's kinda episodic but there is a main story- you just rarely touch on it ever
20-03-2020T01:51:20,SageSaga,there's like 1-4 episodes per season where they have main story stuff
20-03-2020T01:51:34,SageSaga,the anime has been going for 20 years btw
20-03-2020T01:51:41,TheBeckoner,Woa
20-03-2020T01:52:11,TheBeckoner,That seems like alot of time but then I think 20 years ago now was 2000...
20-03-2020T01:52:15,SageSaga,it's also very popular with Japanese women
20-03-2020T01:52:16,unsteddyphoenix,Wait its STILL going?
20-03-2020T01:52:22,AspiringNoodle,Isn't that the one where a famous detective is turned back into a kid?
20-03-2020T01:52:24,SageSaga,yeah still going
20-03-2020T01:53:08,SageSaga,it's actually a running thing that if a woman in japan says she watches anime- she's talking about Conan :P
20-03-2020T01:58:48,SageSaga,that has actually been something ive seen in i think 3 light novels so far
20-03-2020T02:00:15,SageSaga,"im pretty sure it was in the one called ""So I'm a spider, so what?"" and ""JK Haru is a Sex Worker in another world"""
20-03-2020T02:02:36,SageSaga,i always wondered what the JK meant and i looked it up a long time ago- what was it-
20-03-2020T02:02:52,unsteddyphoenix,It means highschool girl yeah?
20-03-2020T02:03:04,unsteddyphoenix,Those titles are excellent
20-03-2020T02:03:06,SageSaga,"something like it was the initials for a high school girl ""sex"" worker or something"
20-03-2020T02:04:00,SageSaga,yeah it means High School Student but it being shortened is used for sex workers
20-03-2020T02:04:39,SageSaga,specifically young women
20-03-2020T02:05:14,unsteddyphoenix,Huh. Quick creepy slang I guess
20-03-2020T02:07:20,SageSaga,well they are usually legal age- but they usually wear their school girl uniforms and its not always sex- not officially at least
20-03-2020T02:08:17,SageSaga,anyways- she gets pulled into another world with an otaku school mate- and the place is reeeeally misogynistic
20-03-2020T02:08:47,SageSaga,and she has to get a job and the only thing shes qualified for is sex work so she becomes a prostitute  in a brothel
20-03-2020T02:09:36,SageSaga,anyone ok with spoilers? XD
20-03-2020T02:10:37,SageSaga,i get the feeling most of you wont be reading it
20-03-2020T02:10:50,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah im not into light novels
20-03-2020T02:11:12,SageSaga,ok for those that might want to read it- dont read the next 2 messages from me :P
20-03-2020T02:12:06,SageSaga,Everyone in the world has some special skill- and her otaku friend gets a thing that basically makes him gain levels 8x faster and is immune to almost all magic and most weapons- so - super OP and she doesnt appear to get anything
20-03-2020T02:13:41,SageSaga,but it turns out God came to her after she started working and ended up giving her an ability too- and it was to copy the abilities of anyone that slept with her- so shes got all the broken abilities and no limit because- she got a no limit ability :P
20-03-2020T02:14:05,SageSaga,oh and slept with is a nicer way of saying what they had to do- yeah
20-03-2020T02:14:19,AspiringNoodle,"...wow that seems even more op, lol"
20-03-2020T02:14:40,SageSaga,it was- very- and it was awesome because you only learned that all in like the last 2 chapters
20-03-2020T02:15:00,AspiringNoodle,I kinda hope they make it an anime.  Sounds interesting~
20-03-2020T02:15:11,AspiringNoodle,"...That or I get into e-books, lol"
20-03-2020T02:15:13,SageSaga,where she- Spoiler - ends up killing the entire army posted at the city after they raped her and her friend for days - end spoiler
20-03-2020T02:15:33,AspiringNoodle,#KarmaIsABeeyotch
20-03-2020T02:16:16,SageSaga,and as awful as that sounds- it was done so well i dont really have any complaints
20-03-2020T02:17:05,SageSaga,normally i hate that trash- but everything in the book is treated with this odd kinda respect- like the sex stuff isnt smut- it's what this woman has to put up with- what she likes- its not porn
20-03-2020T02:17:30,SageSaga,its also not for kids- its an adult story- it's just not a pornographic one
20-03-2020T02:20:48,SageSaga,"i can imagine people buying it being like ""oh a dirty light novel"" and reading it and crying and being like ""this isnt what i bought! I wanted to feel sexy- not just FEEL!"""
20-03-2020T02:21:50,ZRO4825,lmao
20-03-2020T02:22:22,AspiringNoodle,Gotta go to bed. I'll keep those novels in mind
20-03-2020T02:22:42,AspiringNoodle,And great work tonight~
20-03-2020T02:23:10,SageSaga,take care ^^
20-03-2020T02:31:06,SageSaga,so Zro- hows work? Are people tipping better or worse?
20-03-2020T02:31:49,ZRO4825,"'bout the same, near as I can tell"
20-03-2020T02:32:09,SageSaga,around here i know people are tipping more
20-03-2020T02:32:52,SageSaga,but I live in an area with a lot of formerly wealthy old people
20-03-2020T02:34:22,SageSaga,"omg man i saw so many posts this morning that were all like ""kill and eat  the land lords!"""
20-03-2020T02:35:01,ZRO4825,~.~
20-03-2020T02:35:45,SageSaga,"XD and there was a reply that was like ""hey now! my son is a landlord and hes a good man! hes decreasing rent for 3 months and excusing people for as long as he can!"""
20-03-2020T02:36:08,SageSaga,"and the replies to that were like ""F your son!"" ""Im gonna eat your son!"" o_O"
20-03-2020T02:36:39,ZRO4825,-.-
20-03-2020T02:36:51,ZRO4825,People be stupid. X.x
20-03-2020T02:36:54,funnyman42,~<3
20-03-2020T02:38:04,SageSaga,i was like- i get you are angry- and i get why- they had a message from a landlord telling their tenants to go to the churches and ask for money from them to pay their rent...
20-03-2020T02:38:14,SageSaga,but lets not eat people
20-03-2020T02:39:30,SageSaga,and to that landlord- yeah churches havent really done that for people in like 40 years
20-03-2020T02:39:56,ZRO4825,"It depends. Some areas, the churches DO have help programs. But yeah, they aren't just gonna up and pay EVERYONE'S rent..."
20-03-2020T02:40:26,SageSaga,yeah they do help a lot of homeless people- and sometimes their members-
20-03-2020T02:40:46,SageSaga,but not families that are fine until suddenly this happens- and for so many- they cant do that
20-03-2020T02:42:25,SageSaga,also i dont think its right for people to get help from the church like that- i feel like it causes people to feel like they owe the church for doing good things and they end up indebted to the church
20-03-2020T02:43:04,SageSaga,i dont trust the church with that kinda power- they have proven they do bad things with power
20-03-2020T02:44:39,ZRO4825,"lol, true enough"
20-03-2020T02:45:00,SageSaga,maaaan i cant get any of my friends to play this game with me
20-03-2020T02:45:23,ZRO4825,Which one?
20-03-2020T02:45:40,SageSaga,even Mihari refuses to even download it
20-03-2020T02:46:07,SageSaga,Magic... The Gathering.... ONLINE
20-03-2020T02:46:37,ZRO4825,ahhh
20-03-2020T02:47:51,SageSaga,i dont like playing with random people
20-03-2020T02:48:02,SageSaga,i want to play with my friends
20-03-2020T02:48:27,SageSaga,"and chat, and have fun, as i DESTROY THEM WITH COMBOS ONLY A MAD MAN WOULD TRY TO MAKE!"
20-03-2020T02:49:02,ZRO4825,lol
20-03-2020T02:52:07,SageSaga,this is how i play MTG
20-03-2020T02:52:25,SageSaga,Prozd video on playing a card game - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBIsZlV1jHk
20-03-2020T02:57:18,SageSaga,i was even thinking about giving a friend 100 dollars in credit to buy cards to play with me-
20-03-2020T02:58:28,ZRO4825,Colorless Cheese Chakra
20-03-2020T03:00:40,ZRO4825,"Well, that's gonna be a cheeky panel."
20-03-2020T03:01:16,sunblaze,oh my some butt :D
20-03-2020T03:01:34,ZRO4825,Could only be cheekier if it was Nyna and not Kaylin.
20-03-2020T03:05:18,SageSaga,"Nyna - ""Nya! Why do you keep grabbing my butt?!"" Kaylin - ""Wait- have you never seen your butt?"" Nyna - "". . . "" *Mirror* Nyna - ""Omg- i wanna touch it-"""
20-03-2020T03:05:27,ZRO4825,XD
20-03-2020T03:06:22,SageSaga,"""I just thought Tali was being weird and dog like- but i just have a really fine rear"""
20-03-2020T03:09:22,SageSaga,all done!
20-03-2020T03:09:41,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Very well done Sage
20-03-2020T03:09:51,ZRO4825,Nice~
20-03-2020T03:11:59,unsteddyphoenix,Great work!

20-03-2020T14:04:19,Almighty404,"So, this qualifies as an Isekai, right ?"
20-03-2020T14:05:14,SageSaga,the comic?
20-03-2020T14:05:34,SilverTakashi,yee
20-03-2020T14:05:42,SageSaga,yo Silver!
20-03-2020T14:05:48,DNMZ,"Good day all, hope your all enjoying your quarantine"
20-03-2020T14:05:55,SageSaga,yeah the comic AI counts as an isekai
20-03-2020T14:05:57,SilverTakashi,Hi Hi
20-03-2020T14:06:08,Dadrobit,"Nah, no quarantine for me..."
20-03-2020T14:06:57,Dakina,Yo
20-03-2020T14:07:10,Dadrobit,Work is mandatory. They also just announced that they are no longer respecting vacation time. No vacations until Covid is handled.
20-03-2020T14:07:18,RimaDraws,hi!
20-03-2020T14:07:19,RimaDraws,<3
20-03-2020T14:07:20,Dadrobit,o/
20-03-2020T14:07:22,sunblaze,hiya
20-03-2020T14:07:26,Almighty404,"I mean, if there's proof the world is still a game, it'd just more slightly sideways into the Isekai-adjacent ""stuck in VR"" genre."
20-03-2020T14:07:31,RimaDraws,^^
20-03-2020T14:08:27,SageSaga,full dive VR is often still considered another world
20-03-2020T14:08:38,SageSaga,this one more than some
20-03-2020T14:09:01,Almighty404,"That's why I put it as ""Isekai-adjacent"""
20-03-2020T14:09:18,BadFoMo,Is the Matrix considered a full dive VR?
20-03-2020T14:09:36,sunblaze,most certainly
20-03-2020T14:09:38,SageSaga,the Matrix is an Isekai
20-03-2020T14:09:43,Dakina,It ain't Isekai until the main character has a harem.
20-03-2020T14:09:51,SageSaga,incorrect
20-03-2020T14:10:01,SageSaga,"Wizard of Oz, is an Isekai"
20-03-2020T14:10:18,Almighty404,I think Dakina was making a joke about Isekai tropes.
20-03-2020T14:10:34,DNMZ,It's isekai if the main character is overpowered hehe
20-03-2020T14:10:40,Dakina,It was a joke
20-03-2020T14:10:57,SageSaga,factually incorrect jokes arent funny! :P
20-03-2020T14:10:58,BadFoMo,Like Neo?
20-03-2020T14:11:12,Almighty404,"Neo isn't funny, so yes."
20-03-2020T14:11:26,BadFoMo,Being OP.
20-03-2020T14:11:26,sunblaze,actually apart from the slomo and a bit of precognition. Neo was surprisingly weak
20-03-2020T14:11:49,SageSaga,but he could fly- and stop bullets in real time-
20-03-2020T14:12:09,SageSaga,and destroy AI code
20-03-2020T14:12:13,DNMZ,He
20-03-2020T14:12:47,SageSaga,He?
20-03-2020T14:12:47,SilverTakashi,And do a real good impresion of Keanu Reeves!
20-03-2020T14:12:53,DNMZ,Also had super strength
20-03-2020T14:12:54,sunblaze,yeah I guess the destroy coe makes you Op in a world full of code and VR
20-03-2020T14:13:01,Almighty404,Neo could IDKFA
20-03-2020T14:13:28,DNMZ,Mmm actually wouldn't mind seeing Neo fight Kirito
20-03-2020T14:13:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Lord give me serenity because if you give me strength I’m killing this new boy
20-03-2020T14:14:07,Almighty404,"Sadly, Neo couldn't IDDQD"
20-03-2020T14:14:30,sunblaze,indeed no serenity for him :ptv-sad:
20-03-2020T14:23:48,DNMZ,Still sad about Kenny Rodgers
20-03-2020T14:26:08,SageSaga,i hadnt heard about that yet
20-03-2020T14:27:46,DNMZ,Lots of childhood memories with his songs
20-03-2020T14:55:12,DNMZ,Well starting to get sleepy. So bye everyone and take care. Stay safe
20-03-2020T14:55:36,SageSaga,take care

20-03-2020T22:58:45,SpazztasticKiwi,but yesterday I almost threw food at a fools head so it’s better than what’s passed

20-03-2020T23:08:35,SpazztasticKiwi,so either she kept telling me the wrong thing cause she wasn’t focused or I just couldn’t hear
20-03-2020T23:09:01,SpazztasticKiwi,we have presliced stuff but it’s your regular prepackaged stuff
20-03-2020T23:09:36,CrRAR,ah I see
20-03-2020T23:10:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"some of what we can cut in store, we get shipped as precuts for sandwiches but people mostly come by to get special or specific meats or cheeses or cut a certain way or amount"
20-03-2020T23:10:54,SpazztasticKiwi,"the prepackaged stuff is also meat department stuff, not “fresh” deli"
20-03-2020T23:11:23,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve had a guy give me a speech/lecture about the expiration dates on a meat he’d wanted cut
20-03-2020T23:12:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"after we open a new meat chub, we date it to go out in 6 days - it’s then cut up and discounted and lasts another 3ish"
20-03-2020T23:12:26,CrRAR,ahh ok
20-03-2020T23:12:57,SpazztasticKiwi,"this is besides the fact that there’s no way the meat is literally fresh killed, cooked and packaged before shipped to us, to be reasonable there’s got to be a day or two there at the very least for delivery to store"
20-03-2020T23:13:52,SpazztasticKiwi,but this guy asked me how long until the meat I was going to cut for him had been in there and I told him but I also added that it’s usually good for another three days ~provides it’s KEPT REFRIGERATED~

20-03-2020T23:16:42,SpazztasticKiwi,"or as fresh as it can be and I’m just like sir, if you keep it refrigerated and don’t introduce germs like children’s hands touching it or getting slices out with dirty fingers or leaving it on the counter for more than twenty minutesto eat your sandwich"

20-03-2020T23:26:22,SpazztasticKiwi,you leave the mild cheddar out for 10 minutes or more it melts on the counter
20-03-2020T23:26:29,BlackjacksSec99,O.o
20-03-2020T23:26:30,CrRAR,Maybe they add a stabilizer to keep the two different solutions homogenous?

20-03-2020T23:29:30,SpazztasticKiwi,we had a truck of produce come in over the “safe” temperature and they ordered to throw out the whole delivery
20-03-2020T23:29:53,BlackjacksSec99,dunno what it is... it migrated there at some point and frosted over. im kinda scared of it now.
20-03-2020T23:30:42,CrRAR,"tried so hard, and got soooo farrrr :carrot:"
20-03-2020T23:31:05,CrRAR,in the end it doesn't even maaattterrr :potato:
20-03-2020T23:31:14,SpazztasticKiwi,hot foods are to never go below 160 degrees and cold foods are never supposed to go above 40 degrees I believe
20-03-2020T23:31:20,CrRAR,poor lil veggies
20-03-2020T23:31:43,BlackjacksSec99,which is sad cause I cook my steak to 150....
20-03-2020T23:31:44,SpazztasticKiwi,"no exceptions - like I said, it’s gotten whole deliveries thrown in the compost"
20-03-2020T23:31:51,BlackjacksSec99,"oh well, better safe for the masses"
20-03-2020T23:32:17,CrRAR,"yeah 160 is like the universal meat ""safe"" temperature"
20-03-2020T23:32:25,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s got to do with the “temperature danger zone”
20-03-2020T23:32:35,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-laura:
20-03-2020T23:33:06,BlackjacksSec99,we need an emote of Flora tearing into a steak....
20-03-2020T23:33:18,BlackjacksSec99,talk enough about food in here lol
20-03-2020T23:33:22,CrRAR,haha
20-03-2020T23:33:27,SpazztasticKiwi,walmarts got it set for 170 (at least that’s where I cap the temperature at) to ~40
20-03-2020T23:33:54,BlackjacksSec99,170????? geez that will crispify most things to the point of EWWWW
20-03-2020T23:33:58,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-sleepoverA::meat_on_bone:
20-03-2020T23:34:05,BlackjacksSec99,lol ord
20-03-2020T23:34:19,SpazztasticKiwi,more on this friends fiancé.....the amount of times I’ve had to chime in “wash your hands” to him just today is staggering
20-03-2020T23:34:29,BlackjacksSec99,...ewww
20-03-2020T23:34:37,SpazztasticKiwi,170 for internal temperature
20-03-2020T23:34:47,SpazztasticKiwi,so the meat inside is cooked
20-03-2020T23:35:07,BlackjacksSec99,"yeah, crispified..."
20-03-2020T23:35:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"I mean, I saw the dude go over to his coat and use some tattoo goo on his arm"
20-03-2020T23:35:48,SpazztasticKiwi,why he spent money on a tat when he’s got a baby on the way I don’t know
20-03-2020T23:36:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"but after, he tried just putting a new set of gloves on"
20-03-2020T23:36:16,BlackjacksSec99,"and yeah, I handle cash and customer's used parts, so my hands are washed/sanitized OFTEN. like, im suprised they arent dry cracked yet."
20-03-2020T23:36:28,BlackjacksSec99,ohhh fresh tat and not washing hands?????
20-03-2020T23:36:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I told him he need to wash his hands before changing gloves
20-03-2020T23:36:31,BlackjacksSec99,bad!
20-03-2020T23:36:54,SpazztasticKiwi,he tried just swapping gloves again when I turned back around
20-03-2020T23:37:13,BlackjacksSec99,"not only bad for everyone else, but bad for the tattoo, its basically an open wound."
20-03-2020T23:37:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"keep in mind, he apparently didn’t know I saw him use the goo because I then say “you need to wash your hands, I saw you use that tattoo goo”"
20-03-2020T23:38:43,SpazztasticKiwi,"kind of a small deer in headlights moment as it hits him that I’m not stupid, I saw him and I can still see him (and hear the lack of sink water running) not"
20-03-2020T23:38:56,SpazztasticKiwi,blind or stupid
20-03-2020T23:39:14,BlackjacksSec99,"thats sounds like how I have to be with my 7 year old, not a grown ass dude"
20-03-2020T23:39:30,SpazztasticKiwi,"so he goes to the back, wets his hands in the dishwashing sink, and dips it in the sanitizer"
20-03-2020T23:39:43,SpazztasticKiwi,#isweartoGod
20-03-2020T23:39:44,BlackjacksSec99,.....
20-03-2020T23:39:53,SpazztasticKiwi,#boyIwillkillyou
20-03-2020T23:40:13,SpazztasticKiwi,"again, and this time I look him dead in the eye"
20-03-2020T23:40:17,BlackjacksSec99,"no, soap, water, 30 seconds of scrubbing to remove all traces of goo"
20-03-2020T23:40:27,SpazztasticKiwi,“you need to use the hand washing sink”
20-03-2020T23:41:03,SpazztasticKiwi,“I know but (mumbling something I think was something about it washing the goo off his tattoo or something)”
20-03-2020T23:41:19,SpazztasticKiwi,"if you knew, why are we doing this then dude"
20-03-2020T23:41:32,BlackjacksSec99,people are not brilliant
20-03-2020T23:41:45,SpazztasticKiwi,so I continue “you need to wash your hands - they could fire you for that”
20-03-2020T23:42:10,SpazztasticKiwi,"this, praise the good Lord, got his attention and he finally washed his mf hands"
20-03-2020T23:42:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"I don’t like kids, I’m not about to babysit a grown man"
20-03-2020T23:42:42,BlackjacksSec99,"that usually does it, threaten to take the money away"
20-03-2020T23:43:22,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ll also add I was taking care of the lady whose story I told a bit ago that changed her mind nearly 3 times about what meat she wanted cut
20-03-2020T23:43:57,BlackjacksSec99,"man, that was happening during that?"
20-03-2020T23:44:06,SpazztasticKiwi,when my manager finally came back (she had gotten distracted by another coworker and helping her get this new app for work on her phone)
20-03-2020T23:44:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I told her I was going on break
20-03-2020T23:44:54,SpazztasticKiwi,she was perfectly fine with me doing so when I told her what had just happened while she was distracted those 20ish minutes
20-03-2020T23:45:16,BlackjacksSec99,"yeah, time to de-stress for a few"
20-03-2020T23:45:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I was half ready to murder that guy
20-03-2020T23:46:07,SpazztasticKiwi,"trying to take care of a customer, I don’t need to be holding your hand through basic food service sanitation"
20-03-2020T23:46:34,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-RainezZz: nighty night

20-03-2020T23:47:25,SpazztasticKiwi,"later, I was doing roll layout off to the other end of the department and I saw him remove his gloves for a moment"
20-03-2020T23:48:02,SpazztasticKiwi,customer came up and apparently asked about something in the case so he points a few things out and then she says something like “I’ll take..”
20-03-2020T23:48:04,CrRAR,this boy needs some thonks
20-03-2020T23:48:24,SpazztasticKiwi,he reaches for the gloves and I chime out “wash yo hands!”
20-03-2020T23:48:36,SpazztasticKiwi,boy looked over at me like “you can see me?”
20-03-2020T23:48:41,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m not blind

20-03-2020T23:49:25,BlackjacksSec99,"dude, kiwi, you have my sympathies..."
20-03-2020T23:50:09,SpazztasticKiwi,the customer looked over and didn’t seem to have seen me over there either
20-03-2020T23:50:50,SpazztasticKiwi,I couldn’t believe it all with him having a baby on the way with his fiancé
20-03-2020T23:51:26,SpazztasticKiwi,whooping cough has been reported around here and that’s just about guaranteed fatal for infants
20-03-2020T23:51:42,BlackjacksSec99,thats scary as shit
20-03-2020T23:51:51,SpazztasticKiwi,"not to mention whatever else you could give it, and right now, she’s just pregnant"
20-03-2020T23:51:59,SpazztasticKiwi,don’t need to give her anything either
20-03-2020T23:52:12,BlackjacksSec99,corona is worrying enough
20-03-2020T23:52:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I shouldn’t have to be mothering this guy but here we are
20-03-2020T23:53:05,CrRAR,yup
20-03-2020T23:54:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"as for his tattoo, it was mid forearm and it wasn’t like I was asking him to scrub up to the shoulders for surgery"
