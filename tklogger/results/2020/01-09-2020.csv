01-09-2020T14:11:39,TerraTheWizard,that's like going for a jog in a hurricane

01-09-2020T14:12:07,AspiringNoodle,I can't really blame my grandparents.  This was their daily routine before COVID.  They *always* get dinner at the local diner
01-09-2020T14:12:31,AspiringNoodle,"And since my grandmother is pretty far in Alzheimer's territory, it's really hard for my grandpa to do anything"
01-09-2020T14:13:17,CrimsonQuill,"...I've seen alzheimer's first hand. Or at least, Dementia, which is very similar."
01-09-2020T14:13:33,CrimsonQuill,It's very difficult to watch
01-09-2020T14:13:40,AspiringNoodle,"My mistake, personally, was going out to eat twice earlier on in the pandemic when infections were at their lowest post-peak"
01-09-2020T14:13:51,CrimsonQuill,How so?
01-09-2020T14:14:06,AspiringNoodle,"So now that the pandemic is somewhat evened out at a worse spot, the assumption is that I'm okay with it"
01-09-2020T14:14:06,CrRAR,"Mm, I went and grabbed a burger the other day, sat outside though"
01-09-2020T14:14:16,AspiringNoodle,"And if I *don't* go, I'm just being a dick to my grandparents"
01-09-2020T14:15:03,AspiringNoodle,"US seems to be averaging 36k cases a day right now, with a slow downward trend"
01-09-2020T14:15:40,CrRAR,It is weird like when you‚Äôre in a restaurant like the tables are magic saftey zones where masks don‚Äôt matter apparently xD
01-09-2020T14:15:54,AspiringNoodle,And my state is still in the 500 - 800 infections a day range
01-09-2020T14:15:59,CrRAR,Everywhere else: yes
01-09-2020T14:16:01,AspiringNoodle,For the past month
01-09-2020T14:16:14,CrRAR,"At tables: what‚Äôs corona, again?"
01-09-2020T14:16:26,AspiringNoodle,"I think I have a smartass response ready for the ""you're being rude to your grandparents"" statement"
01-09-2020T14:16:40,AspiringNoodle,"""I wear my mask for a straight 8 - 9 hours every day I work, I rarely, if ever, take it off."""
01-09-2020T14:16:57,AspiringNoodle,"""So why in the hell do you think I would want to take it off for an extended period in a crowded building."""
01-09-2020T14:17:43,CrRAR,Well if they‚Äôre willing to take the risk~ but yeah if it was a crowded place I would be a little uneasy
01-09-2020T14:17:59,AspiringNoodle,"Or I could go with the timeless classic. ""Believe what you want, if it makes you happy."""
01-09-2020T14:18:51,CrRAR,"I do love right now that online ordering, if places didn‚Äôt have it before have it now"
01-09-2020T14:19:31,AspiringNoodle,I remember the first two times I went out to eat
01-09-2020T14:19:38,AspiringNoodle,The diner was relatively empty
01-09-2020T14:19:56,AspiringNoodle,"We were the only people in the entire section, the other section we could see would have 2 - 3 parties, maybe 4"
01-09-2020T14:20:34,AspiringNoodle,"Last time I went (unwillingly), the same section had 3 different groups in there"
01-09-2020T14:22:31,CrRAR,Yeah looking at statistics US will probably pass italy and sweden in per capita mortality
01-09-2020T14:23:32,CrRAR,Brazil too is in that cluster.
01-09-2020T14:25:52,AspiringNoodle,"*sigh*, I LOVE how people are trying to find any excuse they can to downplay covid..."
01-09-2020T14:26:03,AspiringNoodle,"""94% of all covid deaths had underlying conditions"""
01-09-2020T14:26:19,AspiringNoodle,Yeah... they did... but they died BECAUSE of covid...
01-09-2020T14:26:54,CrimsonQuill,Off topic but I am almost in 2b2t
01-09-2020T14:27:02,CrimsonQuill,22 in queau
01-09-2020T14:27:15,AspiringNoodle,"It would be like if someone died in a car crash, but they had high blood pressure, maybe a weakened immune system, etc etc etc"
01-09-2020T14:27:28,AspiringNoodle,"And saying that it wasn't the *car crash* that killed them, but the other medical condition..."
01-09-2020T14:27:46,CrimsonQuill,@AspiringNoodle I've noticed a lot about that lately
01-09-2020T14:30:29,AspiringNoodle,"Oh wait, I think I got a better one to explain how stupid this is xD"
01-09-2020T14:30:44,AspiringNoodle,"Same situation, car crash, but the person had a gunshot wound"
01-09-2020T14:31:14,AspiringNoodle,...but the wound is in a non-vital area and they would have lived with / without medical intervention
01-09-2020T14:31:26,AspiringNoodle,But then blaming THAT on their death instead of the car crash
01-09-2020T14:31:39,AspiringNoodle,Because that's essentially what's happening

01-09-2020T15:02:57,AspiringNoodle,I'm just not comfortable with eating at the location
01-09-2020T15:08:09,CrRAR,No hope for outdoor eating?
01-09-2020T15:15:28,AspiringNoodle,Nope.  Their establishment isn't set up for it
01-09-2020T15:15:37,AspiringNoodle,The building is rather old.  And the lot has no space
01-09-2020T15:18:21,CrRAR,Yeah those diners always seem to be in a cramped corner lot with like 7 parking spaces
01-09-2020T15:18:43,CrRAR,It‚Äôs like some kind of unwritten rule of the universe
01-09-2020T15:18:52,AspiringNoodle,This diner actually has a lot of space :D
01-09-2020T15:19:05,AspiringNoodle,"The building decently sized, it's just that it's surrounded on all sides by parking lot."
01-09-2020T15:19:14,CrRAR,"Ah, okay"
01-09-2020T15:19:24,CrimsonQuill,America seems to be built around the motor car
01-09-2020T15:19:32,AspiringNoodle,Because it was
01-09-2020T15:20:01,AspiringNoodle,"Almost the entirety of our infrastructure is built around motor vehicles.  Depending on where you live, a car isn't an option, it's a necessity"
01-09-2020T15:20:13,CrRAR,Cracker Barrel restaurants are specifically placed in places only travelers would really find them
01-09-2020T15:20:34,AspiringNoodle,Some cities are starting to realize this and are beginning to reclaim cities for the people and upping public transit
01-09-2020T15:20:41,CrRAR,Like they‚Äôre always never close to other restaurants but always right near a highway
01-09-2020T15:21:07,CrRAR,A gas station + highway nearby is one of their criteria
01-09-2020T15:21:26,CrimsonQuill,"I read that the pub;ic transport system in cities was dismantled by unscrupulous motorway developers, although I might be mistaken"
01-09-2020T15:21:40,AspiringNoodle,It might be possible
01-09-2020T15:21:44,CrRAR,"You would think that‚Äôs just about anywhere, but they choose their locations to seem more off-the-beaten-path"
01-09-2020T15:21:53,AspiringNoodle,"Tbh, the only biggest cities seem to have robust public transport"
01-09-2020T15:22:18,CrRAR,Big auto probably wants everyone to need a car
01-09-2020T15:22:53,CrRAR,"Just like big pharma wants everyone on a pill, and big gun wants a gun for every man, woman and child xD"
01-09-2020T15:30:29,AspiringNoodle,"Pff, that's unrealistic"
01-09-2020T15:30:39,CrRAR,lol
01-09-2020T15:30:43,AspiringNoodle,"Just need those few collectors who buy enough guns to outfit a small army, LMAO"
01-09-2020T15:31:45,CrRAR,"Yeah, but then sadly you see/hear those news stories of a tragic accident involving a child at a gun show. There were a couple in recent memory."
01-09-2020T15:32:15,CrimsonQuill,"It's a no win scenario for you over there, isn't it?"
01-09-2020T15:32:21,CrimsonQuill,"Keep guns, shootings continue"
01-09-2020T15:32:23,CrRAR,"I understand parents wanting to share a hobby, but one such incident involved a kid and a demonstration uzi."
01-09-2020T15:32:34,CrRAR,"Like, really, NRA"
01-09-2020T15:32:46,CrimsonQuill,"Ban guns, a whole load remain in the black market and you have thousands, maybe millions, circulating illegally"
01-09-2020T15:32:57,CrimsonQuill,It's a catch-22
01-09-2020T15:33:29,CrRAR,"Yeah, I just think there should be a more responsible approach... more respect toward their dangerousness"
01-09-2020T15:33:57,CrimsonQuill,"In the UK and Ireland, you need a license to get firearms, and they're usually BB guns, pistols, hunting rifles and going up to shotguns (double barrel or birdshot usually)"
01-09-2020T15:34:10,CrimsonQuill,There is very strict gun control.
01-09-2020T15:34:59,CrimsonQuill,"Although, as the troubles will tell you, you don't need a gun to kill dozens of people...half of the car bombs and the like in the Troubles were made with fertilizer, a lot of which contains ammonium nitrate."
01-09-2020T15:35:17,CrimsonQuill,And we saw what a warehouse full of that did in Beirut.
01-09-2020T15:36:05,CrimsonQuill,"Look up the Westminster bombing, Omagh bombings, Dublin bombings-most of them car bombs, either UVF or IRA."
01-09-2020T15:36:10,AspiringNoodle,Banning guns isn't very easy over here.  The 2nd Amendment protects the right
01-09-2020T15:36:15,CrimsonQuill,My parents told me horror stories.
01-09-2020T15:36:19,AspiringNoodle,"It also ties up into other things, like the right to defend yourself"

01-09-2020T15:36:49,CrimsonQuill,"And of course if they were banned, there would be plenty of those who would refuse to give up their firearms, or sell them to the black market."
01-09-2020T15:37:05,AspiringNoodle,"And while certain states are testing the limits of how much they can restrict the right to bear arms, there's a certain feeling that they've gone too far for decades..."
01-09-2020T15:37:17,AspiringNoodle,Unconstitutionally so
01-09-2020T15:38:03,AspiringNoodle,"I'm going to call it a conspiracy theory, because there's no way I could ever find proof"
01-09-2020T15:38:32,AspiringNoodle,"But the belief is that these states do ultimately want to strip all gun rights away, or make it so inconvenient to own a firearm that they've effectively done the same"
01-09-2020T15:38:52,CrRAR,"Yeah, fair access is fine, it just seems that we have other freedoms that can be revolked much easier."
01-09-2020T15:39:02,CrRAR,The idea of privilege vs right.
01-09-2020T15:39:12,CrRAR,Or maybe privilige to a right
01-09-2020T15:39:13,AspiringNoodle,"But they're working a balancing act where they slowly tighten the belt in such a way that people don't outright revolt, and that the Supreme Court doesn't get involved"
01-09-2020T15:39:31,CrimsonQuill,Sensible enough imo
01-09-2020T15:39:33,AspiringNoodle,The Supreme Court hasn't taken on any firearms related cases in a long time
01-09-2020T15:39:54,AspiringNoodle,If they do get involved... it may lead to a *lot* of overturned laws
01-09-2020T15:46:19,CrimsonQuill,The myriad of politics in the US makes ours look like a walk in the park...
01-09-2020T16:01:13,AspiringNoodle,Part of it is the vast differences in needs
01-09-2020T16:01:26,AspiringNoodle,Guns are actually a *great* example of this
01-09-2020T16:02:21,AspiringNoodle,"In a city, you might not need more than a handgun for personal defense.  But because of the density of cities, that also means the police have more of a presence"
01-09-2020T16:02:58,AspiringNoodle,"But if you're on a farm in the middle of the country, or even more remote than that, there are some pretty tough predators.  A tiny little 9mm isn't gonna cut it"
01-09-2020T16:03:03,CrimsonQuill,I've been seeing a lot of mixed messages about the police
01-09-2020T16:03:15,CrimsonQuill,"As for the farm, it makes sense"
01-09-2020T16:03:23,AspiringNoodle,"Trust me when I say we have politics within politics, lol"
01-09-2020T16:03:24,CrimsonQuill,"Even here, farmers often have guns"
01-09-2020T16:03:59,CrimsonQuill,"Well, your parties (and most parties in history) were founded on Left-right wing divisions."
01-09-2020T16:04:09,CrimsonQuill,Ours were more Pro-treaty vs Anti-treaty
01-09-2020T16:04:39,CrimsonQuill,And that brought a whole different set of headaches
01-09-2020T16:05:01,AspiringNoodle,Our police need reformed
01-09-2020T16:05:10,CrimsonQuill,I read about it.
01-09-2020T16:05:11,AspiringNoodle,"Part of the problem is the boys in blue ""protect their own"""
01-09-2020T16:05:25,AspiringNoodle,"It means even when there's corruption, they close ranks to protect fellow officers"
01-09-2020T16:05:27,CrimsonQuill,Apparently it's really hard because of a lack of centralization
01-09-2020T16:05:36,AspiringNoodle,"And if you speak up about it, it's likely to backfire on your career"
01-09-2020T16:05:37,CrimsonQuill,And the whole peer pressure
01-09-2020T16:05:57,AspiringNoodle,The whole tribalist mindset is what started this whole thing
01-09-2020T16:06:08,CrimsonQuill,Tribalism will be the death of us all.
01-09-2020T16:06:20,AspiringNoodle,"Until we have ways to flush out the bad apples, and punish those who protect them, this will never end"

01-09-2020T16:07:06,CrimsonQuill,I'd like to see the character Sam Vimes doing that (although he's Discworld)
01-09-2020T16:07:20,CrimsonQuill,That man'd not just root out the problem
01-09-2020T16:07:43,CrimsonQuill,He'd beat it down and kick it in the unmentionables before throwing it into prison.

01-09-2020T16:57:00,CrimsonQuill,Halo 3 got me in a fix too

01-09-2020T23:51:43,SpazztasticKiwi,somebody really asked me if a rectangle is a square
01-09-2020T23:51:47,SpazztasticKiwi,that‚Äôs what happened
01-09-2020T23:52:04,SpazztasticKiwi,that‚Äôs what‚Äôs up
01-09-2020T23:52:12,CrRAR,oh no
01-09-2020T23:52:26,CrRAR,reality is a fragile thing when questions like that get asked
01-09-2020T23:52:51,CrRAR,I think a square is a special kind of rectangle
01-09-2020T23:53:04,CrRAR,but rectangles are not squares
01-09-2020T23:53:23,CrRAR,squares are rectangles technically though

01-09-2020T23:54:42,CrRAR,because he is MATH MAN
01-09-2020T23:54:44,SpazztasticKiwi,a small part of my soul escaped & died

01-09-2020T23:58:07,CrRAR,wait
01-09-2020T23:58:14,CrRAR,what is the cupcake cake option?
01-09-2020T23:58:22,CrRAR,is it a cake of cupcakes?
01-09-2020T23:58:30,CrRAR,Or a cake with bonus cupcakes?
