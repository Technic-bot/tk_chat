15-10-2020T06:53:57,AspiringNoodle,"Me: ""Hmm... an 850W power supply might be overkill for my build... but I can get it for a few dollars cheaper than a 750W if I get this one from Amazon..."""
15-10-2020T06:54:22,AspiringNoodle,"LTT's latest video: ""Two 3090's in SLI and a 10900K are tripping overvolt protection on a 1000W power supply."""
15-10-2020T06:54:55,AspiringNoodle,"Suddenly I feel confident in my purchase, especially since I plan on upgrading the processor / GPU at some point in the future xD"
15-10-2020T07:23:28,CrRAR,"Yeah, you're better just over speccing a PSU than not, you're just buying more capability going higher wattage."
15-10-2020T07:24:14,CrRAR,Also any PSU using a fraction of its capacity is more efficient (less overhead watt burn) if running under it's full capacity.
15-10-2020T07:25:05,CrRAR,Like how brakes on cars 'fade' when overused/stressed reduce stopping distance.
15-10-2020T07:25:41,CrRAR,Increased heat causes reduced functionality at the fringes of designed capacity.
15-10-2020T07:26:19,CrRAR,Hence why bigger brakes are an upgrade that enhances stopping power and reduces brake fatigue.
15-10-2020T07:43:03,CrRAR,"Don't always need it, but it sure is great when you do."
15-10-2020T08:05:51,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
15-10-2020T08:06:49,AspiringNoodle,LTT was testing RTX 3090's in SLI for reasons
15-10-2020T08:07:15,AspiringNoodle,"And combined with the 10900k, it was enough to trip the overcurrent protection on their 1000W power supply, lol"
15-10-2020T08:08:34,AspiringNoodle,"suffice to say, my power supply should comfortably handle a 3080 and any ryzen processor I choose, and have plenty of wattage to spare for degredation over time"
15-10-2020T08:31:20,CrRAR,"Yeah, it might just be the architecture is due for a refresh I remember 2010-11 the reviews of nvidia cards that era were like, ""it sucks power, and it's 1000 degrees, but boy does it kick out great frame rates"""
15-10-2020T08:31:50,AspiringNoodle,"the 30 series is the true next gen, haha"
15-10-2020T08:32:04,CrRAR,Around the time the Fermi archetecture/gen was out.
15-10-2020T08:32:21,AspiringNoodle,"20 series caught flak, and rightfully so, for the massive price hike and generally *meh* improvement in performance.  Wasn't great, but wasn't terrible."
15-10-2020T08:32:49,AspiringNoodle,"Also, NOBODY had access to the raytracing tech before hand so we're now on the 30 series and the list of raytracing capable games is still just barely growing."
15-10-2020T08:32:57,CrRAR,"Yeah, I think what happened was the fallout from the effectiveness of mining cryptos probably j"
15-10-2020T08:33:11,CrRAR,had them selling fewer cards now
15-10-2020T08:33:20,CrRAR,*has
15-10-2020T08:33:28,AspiringNoodle,"So the 30 series is a ridiculous performance improvement, AND they're cheaper."
15-10-2020T08:33:53,AspiringNoodle,"Pro tip, Nvidia, if yah gonna sell a product on a gimmick, make sure the gimmick is actually flippin' usable."
15-10-2020T08:34:21,CrRAR,"Like they have to spread the R&D costs now over fewer expected to sell units maybe, when back when everyone was buying for crypto ppl were buying by the pallet/crate xD"
15-10-2020T08:34:39,AspiringNoodle,"Seriously, the level of optimization that's taken over a year for ray tracing to not nuke your FPS is ridiculous."
15-10-2020T08:34:59,CrRAR,"Plus, I'd imagine people might actually have less to spend these days."
15-10-2020T08:35:00,AspiringNoodle,Jayztwocents did an update on ray tracing not that long ago
15-10-2020T08:35:11,CrRAR,Oh yeah
15-10-2020T08:35:15,AspiringNoodle,"Same video card, same settings, same game, HUGE fps gains"
15-10-2020T08:35:41,AspiringNoodle,I'll probably buy a 40 series at the earliest
15-10-2020T08:35:49,CrRAR,The 1000 series was literally dedicated to ramping up computation
15-10-2020T08:36:49,CrRAR,Was worth skipping to the 2000s cuz for most typical workloads/games the real improvement was at the 2000 release
15-10-2020T08:37:11,CrRAR,That too was really the big VR capable generation too
15-10-2020T08:37:30,AspiringNoodle,I got a 2070 super :P
15-10-2020T08:37:36,CrRAR,Nice
15-10-2020T08:37:57,AspiringNoodle,"Much better than a 2070, and about as much performance as a 2080, but the price of a 2070 xD"
15-10-2020T08:40:56,AspiringNoodle,love random blackouts
15-10-2020T08:41:14,AspiringNoodle,"But this is a nice computer, so it doesn't take long to get back up and running :ptv-laugh:"
15-10-2020T08:51:25,CrRAR,Yeah we had a 10 second power blink yesterday.

15-10-2020T12:41:24,AspiringNoodle,"Lol, looks like Stadia is gonna die soon"
15-10-2020T12:49:26,CrimsonQuill,Stadia?
15-10-2020T12:50:31,TerraTheWizard,that was fast
15-10-2020T12:50:37,TerraTheWizard,google's game streaming thing
15-10-2020T12:51:04,CrimsonQuill,Oh
15-10-2020T12:51:05,TerraTheWizard,i think microsoft did their own one which is a lot better
15-10-2020T12:51:10,TerraTheWizard,has the game pass games
15-10-2020T12:51:10,CrimsonQuill,Okayu
15-10-2020T12:58:47,AspiringNoodle,Google is releasing a new Chromecast and discontinuing the old one (which is a necessity if you want to use Stadia on a TV)
15-10-2020T12:59:27,AspiringNoodle,BUT Stadia is not officially supported on the new Chromecast... and you can only get the old one by buying one of the founder's editions of Stadia that ships a Stadia controller
15-10-2020T12:59:57,AspiringNoodle,"You can try side-loading Stadia onto the new Chromecast, but it might either act janky or refuse to work at all."
15-10-2020T13:00:50,AspiringNoodle,"So... let's think about this.  Goodle is releasing new hardware which is essential for Stadia to work at home.  But they aren't supporting Stadia at launch.  Meanwhile, alternatives like Geforce Now and Steam Link are supported on the new device."
15-10-2020T13:01:35,AspiringNoodle,It's almost like Stadia is failing hard and they're hoping it'll just die off and people will forget about it.
15-10-2020T13:01:53,CrimsonQuill,"Ah, I see now"
15-10-2020T13:02:11,AspiringNoodle,"I remember finding a Stadia fan boy on Twitter, oh man was this guy sucking Google's D HARD."
15-10-2020T13:02:33,AspiringNoodle,"Man is he gonna be devastated when everyone finally tells him ""I told you so.  For months.  But you didn't listen."""
15-10-2020T13:03:30,AspiringNoodle,"Technical issues abound, nonsensical business model, Google's prevalence for bailing on new products / services if they aren't immediately a smash hit :/"
15-10-2020T13:04:01,CrimsonQuill,The wonderful life of corporate business...
15-10-2020T13:04:05,AspiringNoodle,We all saw this coming.  The only way I'll be shocked is if Google reverses course and starts pumping resources into Stadia again
15-10-2020T13:04:45,AspiringNoodle,"But given how it's going and how they've behaved in the past, I feel like this new product is well on its way to the Google Graveyard."
15-10-2020T13:05:43,AspiringNoodle,"In other news, the new Marvel's Avengers game is going the way of Anthem"
15-10-2020T13:05:48,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-laugh:
15-10-2020T13:07:28,TerraTheWizard,the problem is it's still too early for streamed games
15-10-2020T13:07:43,TerraTheWizard,give it another decade or so for internet to catch up
15-10-2020T13:12:30,AspiringNoodle,It's not even that.  Google's business model made 0 sense
15-10-2020T13:12:47,AspiringNoodle,"First off, you can ONLY stream.  Other services give you the option to either stream, or download the games you want to play"
15-10-2020T13:13:30,AspiringNoodle,"Second, you pay for ACCESS.  While there is a free version that limits things like resolution, framerate, quality, etc, to get the better experience, you pay a subscription."
15-10-2020T13:14:38,AspiringNoodle,"Third, and this ties into the second point, you don't own games on Stadia.  You have to pay for every single game you want to play, like you're buying to own.  But you're buying access to that title."
15-10-2020T13:15:10,AspiringNoodle,"If Stadia is ever killed off, every single purchase you make is thrown in the garbage, and there's nothing you can do."
15-10-2020T13:15:42,AspiringNoodle,"I feel sorry for the people who like Stadia, I really do.  They just don't see that they've thrown their money away."
15-10-2020T13:17:54,AspiringNoodle,Ugh... I gotta work on condensing my thoughts.  Wall-of-text :ptv-unimpressed:
15-10-2020T13:29:28,SpazztasticKiwi,seems to be the only thing to come online to

15-10-2020T15:37:53,TerraTheWizard,changing the wording of my one because i don't think people are getting my reference

15-10-2020T15:39:28,CrimsonQuill,The last suggestion I had (which I'm replacing) was Red having a nightmare of an alternate reality where he had been a little more...deadly...with his sword the night of Zen's attack.

15-10-2020T23:55:17,CrRAR,:feet:
15-10-2020T23:55:43,BadFoMo,The thing on the site sounds cool.

15-10-2020T23:56:33,Dadrobit,"Hmmm, an account would be more immediately set up, but installing it on your own website would probably be more future-proof against any changes AS might do in the future."

15-10-2020T23:57:14,Dadrobit,And it keeps everything more localized instead of having ANOTHER website fans have to check for stuff.
15-10-2020T23:57:51,Twokinds,Yeah...
15-10-2020T23:58:04,Twokinds,"If I got an artstation I'd have to actually use it, I guess."
15-10-2020T23:58:23,BadFoMo,Future-proofing makes hosting it yourself sound even better.
15-10-2020T23:58:30,CrRAR,"*people wander into the 3D VR part of the website, never leave*"
