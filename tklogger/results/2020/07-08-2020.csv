07-08-2020T00:01:07,AspiringNoodle,"Is... is that ""The Nightmare""?"
07-08-2020T00:01:09,Werewing,There is much sacred in this chat.
07-08-2020T00:01:11,AspiringNoodle,From Metroid Fusion???
07-08-2020T00:01:15,Werewing,Mostly anime.
07-08-2020T00:02:02,SpazztasticKiwi,"dont worry ord, you’re made of salt not sugar so you’ll melt, not dissolve"
07-08-2020T00:02:22,Dadrobit,"Mmmm, did in fact end up watching Princess Mononoke last night. Definitely holds up better than Howl's Moving Castle."
07-08-2020T00:02:35,BlackjackSec99,PM is awesome
07-08-2020T00:02:40,Ordithus,mononoke is really good
07-08-2020T00:02:42,SpazztasticKiwi,looks like get yer butt in a bunker weather
07-08-2020T00:02:57,AspiringNoodle,Love Mononoke~
07-08-2020T00:03:00,BlackjackSec99,looks like mini hurricane
07-08-2020T00:03:05,AspiringNoodle,And seriously
07-08-2020T00:03:07,KeefMcDerpface,\o Night all. :ptv-sleepy:
07-08-2020T00:03:09,Dadrobit,Probably watch Nausicca tonight. That or Kiki's Delivery Service.
07-08-2020T00:03:11,Ordithus,night keef
07-08-2020T00:03:16,BlackjackSec99,night keef!!!!
07-08-2020T00:03:17,Dadrobit,o/ Keef
07-08-2020T00:03:17,AspiringNoodle,That radar image makes me think of The Nightmare from Metroid Fusion...
07-08-2020T00:03:28,AspiringNoodle,"..Dadro, I honestly don't know which to recommend"
07-08-2020T00:03:48,SpazztasticKiwi,movies movies movies movies moviesmoooovies 🎶
07-08-2020T00:03:55,AspiringNoodle,"Do you want a more slice-of-life coming-of-age fantasy, or potential end of the world war film?"
07-08-2020T00:04:01,Dadrobit,Probably Kiki. Never watched the whole thing. Only ever saw pieces at my sister's place.
07-08-2020T00:04:14,Werewing,"I recommend Kiki, keep it positive before bed."
07-08-2020T00:04:18,AspiringNoodle,^
07-08-2020T00:04:22,SpazztasticKiwi,I was thinking a movie tonight myself but there’s no telling what horror awaits me for tomorrow’s hours
07-08-2020T00:04:25,AspiringNoodle,Especially if you've seen some bits
07-08-2020T00:04:26,Ordithus,haven't watched kiki's delivery service yet
07-08-2020T00:04:30,SpazztasticKiwi,same
07-08-2020T00:04:30,Dadrobit,"Pfft, bed is another ten hours off for me."
07-08-2020T00:04:34,AspiringNoodle,"Ord, I can send you a dvd, lol"
07-08-2020T00:04:54,Ordithus,"I have a copy, actually.  Buddy is borrowing it though"
07-08-2020T00:05:03,AspiringNoodle,Tell him to hurry up!
07-08-2020T00:05:05,SpazztasticKiwi,torn between “go ahead to bed” and “what’s one more hour....”
07-08-2020T00:05:06,AspiringNoodle,It's one of my favorites
07-08-2020T00:05:19,BlackjackSec99,"was binge watching Wizards with the kids before this, good series if youve seen the rest of the Tails or ARcadia trilogy"
07-08-2020T00:05:44,SpazztasticKiwi,the only wizards I can think of is wizards of waverly place
07-08-2020T00:05:48,Dadrobit,It's been high in my priority list. Recently found out one of my professors worked on it in the sound design department. So it needs to be watched soonish.
07-08-2020T00:05:48,AspiringNoodle,^^^^^^^^^
07-08-2020T00:05:51,AspiringNoodle,yaaaaaaaaaaaas
07-08-2020T00:05:58,SpazztasticKiwi,think tank is dry rn
07-08-2020T00:06:39,BlackjackSec99,"Troll Hunters, 3 Below, and Wizards, its actually a really good series as a whole and tells 3 different stories happening at the same-ish time"
07-08-2020T00:07:04,BlackjackSec99,yes its kids based but its well animated and the dialogue is top notch
07-08-2020T00:07:04,Dadrobit,He called it Kiki the Teenage Witch. Was funny af.
07-08-2020T00:07:19,BlackjackSec99,.......lol
07-08-2020T00:07:38,SpazztasticKiwi,"since you said you binged it with the kids, I didn’t consider it would have anything but animation and kids themes"
07-08-2020T00:07:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I doubt many people binge slasher films with small children
07-08-2020T00:08:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I watched that new animation thing with Tom Holland awhile ago
07-08-2020T00:08:41,BlackjackSec99,"it does, but it doesnt? like theres death and such.... and touches on some darker topics, and its for sure not all sunshine and rainbows..."
07-08-2020T00:09:06,SpazztasticKiwi,"sure, my kid paid little attention but he doesn’t have a good attention span to begin with"
07-08-2020T00:13:45,BlackjackSec99,"alrighty, time for me to hit the hammock... night all!"
07-08-2020T00:13:55,Ordithus,night blackjack
07-08-2020T00:14:00,AspiringNoodle,night
07-08-2020T00:14:08,Dadrobit,o/
07-08-2020T00:18:07,ZRO4825,"Try laying in the hammock, works better than hitting it. :P"
07-08-2020T00:20:06,Dadrobit,Is she controlling a battle mech?
07-08-2020T00:20:45,w0lfmare,A spaceship
07-08-2020T00:20:50,SpazztasticKiwi,joke fell flat I c
07-08-2020T00:21:24,Dadrobit,Ah. The way she has her hands slightly up and to the side makes her look like a DJ at a concert at a glance.
07-08-2020T00:21:34,SpazztasticKiwi,another missing emoji the hammock
07-08-2020T00:21:53,Dadrobit,Needs more strobe lights and fog machines though.
07-08-2020T00:22:13,SpazztasticKiwi,at least everyone would be wearing pants
07-08-2020T00:22:34,Dadrobit,"You and I clearly go to different concerts, Spazz."
07-08-2020T00:22:40,RedDragonSyndicate,Heya

07-08-2020T17:31:17,SpazztasticKiwi,saw a guy that decided jumping over an open fire hydrant was a good idea

07-08-2020T19:06:49,CrRAR,Do they “breathe” through their skin?
07-08-2020T19:07:30,SpazztasticKiwi,they have no diaphragm for regulating air pressure so they have to force it in & out with that ribbit motion they do with their throat
07-08-2020T19:07:47,SpazztasticKiwi,which sounds exhausting
07-08-2020T19:07:58,SpazztasticKiwi,manual breathing
07-08-2020T19:09:19,CrRAR,Big mouthy breaths
07-08-2020T19:12:13,CrRAR,So the deep gravelly croaks are pretty much the guy frogs competing to be the most barry white casanova sounding they can be.
