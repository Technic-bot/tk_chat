04-05-2020T16:35:53,JojoGD,I doubled my progress on Theory of everything 2
04-05-2020T16:36:19,JojoGD,From a 19% to a 42%. Faster progress than expected

04-05-2020T16:37:30,CrimsonQuill,:)
04-05-2020T16:51:46,JojoGD,I forgot but if I’m lucky I can get past 60%
04-05-2020T16:51:53,CrimsonQuill,Just seen new sketches
04-05-2020T16:51:57,CrimsonQuill,I love 'em!

04-05-2020T17:16:59,CrimsonQuill,The problem with me is I can't look at anything Twokinds related if i know I'll be seeing other people than my immediete family within a short period of time.
04-05-2020T17:17:22,CrimsonQuill,So I generally look at it after I've headed up to my bedroom for the night. Much more enjoyable.
04-05-2020T17:17:49,CrimsonQuill,The kicker is...my shifts finish at 8:00pm. Then I need to shower and put a wash on. Then I need to take the wash out.
04-05-2020T17:18:00,CrimsonQuill,"By the time it's done, it's 10:00pm or so"
04-05-2020T17:18:13,CrimsonQuill,Maybe 10:30/11:00pm
04-05-2020T17:18:23,CrimsonQuill,And that's not much time for Twokinds.
04-05-2020T17:18:28,CrimsonQuill,...
