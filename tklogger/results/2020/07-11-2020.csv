07-11-2020T15:55:26,AspiringNoodle,...no.
07-11-2020T15:55:48,Dadrobit,Immediately half of our patrol officers noped the fuck out and simply said that they won't be reporting tips at all in that case.

07-11-2020T16:04:27,BadFoMo,We're not doing TKPolls this time?
07-11-2020T16:04:28,Chooper,"Ah shieeet, here we go again."
07-11-2020T16:05:00,Dimensional,He sent out the poll a few days ago for us all to vote on
07-11-2020T16:05:03,Dadrobit,"Right on. I'll probably only be around for the results, I have a ton of work that needs doing today."
07-11-2020T16:05:08,Dimensional,So it's already voted.
07-11-2020T16:05:12,Rainelover,"Unsurprisingly, restoring an alternative post-nuclear war Washington D.C to it’s former glory takes a long time"

07-11-2020T16:07:20,Sammit,Hi Zapili
07-11-2020T16:07:42,Ordithus,"the poll was via patreon, tom is working on the results"
07-11-2020T16:08:30,NeonMitsumi,dun dun
07-11-2020T16:08:31,TheSexyBeast,"So I checked out the TK Discord, not what I was expecting."
07-11-2020T16:09:58,BadFoMo,"Is Patreon Voting going to be the norm? If so, I /might/ be tempted to become a $10 Patreon again. ...Maybe."
07-11-2020T16:10:12,Jirka,Does anyone have a link to TK Discort? Please
07-11-2020T16:10:35,ProsePro7,I hate the omni poll
07-11-2020T16:10:35,Dadrobit,"There have only been 14 omnipolls ever, probably not the norm lol."
07-11-2020T16:10:56,Dadrobit,"I personally like them, prevents groups of death."
07-11-2020T16:10:57,Rainelover,"alternatively, if you are wondering what the U.S. Presidential election results were, then I’m happy to say that we decided to get rid of the fascist oompah loompah in favor of sanity"
07-11-2020T16:11:15,ProsePro7,NO POLITICS

07-11-2020T16:11:26,TheSexyBeast,Jesus...
07-11-2020T16:11:30,Zakuru,"""Since there's so many, don't feel obligated. I know it's a lot to read through, believe me! That's one of the reasons why I avoid doing omnipolls too often, since I don't want you to feel overwhelmed. """
07-11-2020T16:11:32,Ordithus,I am not moderating that kind of discussion with this many people
07-11-2020T16:11:44,BadFoMo,"@ProsePro7 Why? @Dadrobit Well, I guess I'm still out."
07-11-2020T16:12:27,Rainelover,"Yeah, I don’t blame you, it’s not worth the time and effort needed to keep it from turning into a flame war"
07-11-2020T16:12:33,RedEyesWheeler,Thank you ProsePro7
07-11-2020T16:12:46,Ordithus,It would likely result in many many bans
07-11-2020T16:12:54,ProsePro7,Omni polls just focus on the super popular ones  spreading out the vote gives the esoteric ones more of a chance
07-11-2020T16:13:25,ProsePro7,@RedEyesWheeler I dont know what for but youre welcome
07-11-2020T16:13:29,Ordithus,But they tend to get a lot more participation
07-11-2020T16:13:35,Zakuru,^
07-11-2020T16:13:44,RedEyesWheeler,For calling for no politics
07-11-2020T16:13:44,ProsePro7,Not always a good thing Ord
07-11-2020T16:13:47,Ordithus,"Whereas the stream votes may get about 40 voters, the omnipoll gets darn near every patron"
07-11-2020T16:14:07,Dadrobit,"omnipolls help out with people who simply can't attend. Like me, I'm only here for like, every fifth vote."
07-11-2020T16:14:12,ProsePro7,@RedEyesWheeler Oh I am a very political guy but there is a time for peace and a time for war and this stream is a time for peace
07-11-2020T16:14:18,Zakuru,what dad said
07-11-2020T16:14:22,TheSexyBeast,So 7 Kat requests win?
07-11-2020T16:14:31,Zakuru,tom still gets picks
07-11-2020T16:14:40,Hopefighter,"Yeah, Kat seems to win more often than any other character"

07-11-2020T16:15:24,Rainelover,"Indeed, we don’t need to worry about that until January, but for now, it’s time to just relax"
07-11-2020T16:15:27,Dadrobit,"Yeah, kat wins regardless."
07-11-2020T16:15:32,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I can still feel Teddy vibrating from those Kat wins
07-11-2020T16:15:47,Jirka,Hi Marv
07-11-2020T16:15:48,ProsePro7,I dont mean Kat specifically but in geneal
07-11-2020T16:15:53,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hey Hey
07-11-2020T16:15:57,Dadrobit,"Though looking at the past omnipolls, Kat wasn't nearly as dominating as you're asserting. One to two kats in general."
07-11-2020T16:16:02,Zakuru,"if the normal flow of the fandom gets you upset, then ignore it and just cheer for the change of pace."
07-11-2020T16:16:24,Dadrobit,3 omnipolls ago we had 0 kats
07-11-2020T16:16:45,Zakuru,i think omnipolls are mostly in nora's favor XD
07-11-2020T16:16:50,ProsePro7,There are certain kinds of picks that get strong number of votes
07-11-2020T16:16:53,Dadrobit,Nibbly actually
07-11-2020T16:16:54,TheSexyBeast,"Kat was just an example, not a given"
07-11-2020T16:17:00,ProsePro7,True
07-11-2020T16:17:08,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nora and Nibbly are both great so makes sense to me
07-11-2020T16:17:11,Zakuru,I don't remember which wons were from omnipolls since they happen so rarely
07-11-2020T16:17:24,Zakuru,*ones lol
07-11-2020T16:17:25,ProsePro7,Did Tom say whats holding him up

07-11-2020T16:17:31,Dadrobit,"Sorry, but if you want to give reasonable arguments, you examples should actually be good."
07-11-2020T16:17:40,TheSexyBeast,"The ""Good Morning, ______"" is another one"
07-11-2020T16:17:44,Ordithus,Enjoy the variety
07-11-2020T16:17:47,ProsePro7,Calm down Robit
07-11-2020T16:18:06,BadFoMo,"I find the Omni Polls to be more fair. Yes, T&A and TG might still win, but everything has a 7 chances to win (4 votes 3 picks)! Also, what @Dadrobit said."
07-11-2020T16:18:10,Dadrobit,"Look, all I'm saying, is it's not the end of the world lol."
07-11-2020T16:18:23,TheSexyBeast,Everyone is on so on edge...
07-11-2020T16:18:30,ProsePro7,For many reasons
07-11-2020T16:18:32,Zakuru,you mean just prose
07-11-2020T16:18:54,FenceEqualizer,Wait are we here to be angry at omnipolls?!
07-11-2020T16:18:57,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Everyone else seems pretty chill imo
07-11-2020T16:19:04,FenceEqualizer,I hate omnipolls it has the word polls in it
07-11-2020T16:19:09,Ordithus,I'm not chill. I'm cozy

07-11-2020T16:28:12,Twokinds,Of course that's that frame Picarto picks as its preview
07-11-2020T16:28:13,AspiringNoodle,"But if you want to model for animations, then it's a bit less fun"
07-11-2020T16:28:24,FenceEqualizer,It always looked fun. Having yoir creations actually animate

07-11-2020T22:40:29,Roughlandin,"Clovis: ""You're trying to kidnap what I'VE rightfully stolen!"""
07-11-2020T22:40:48,Dadrobit,Pirates are more Australian I think than Irish.
07-11-2020T22:40:51,AspiringNoodle,Brutus is smitten~
07-11-2020T22:41:11,Rainelover,"“She promised me good times and booze eternal, it’s kinda hard to pass up such an offer”"
07-11-2020T22:41:44,ProsePro7,...Big Gun?
07-11-2020T22:41:48,Roughlandin,Pirates aren't Irish? Don't tell the Flogging Mollies
07-11-2020T22:41:57,Roughlandin,Or the Dropkick Murphies
07-11-2020T22:42:03,ShamusTheFox,I like how Clovis's cousin is so much taller than Clovis.
07-11-2020T22:42:20,Roughlandin,Clovis suffers from hybrid dwarfism
07-11-2020T22:42:38,ProsePro7,"Pirates come from the poor of British society so Cockney, Dublin, Highlanders the accent's a mix of them all"
07-11-2020T22:42:42,unsteddyphoenix,"""hes mine! Wait not like that!"""
07-11-2020T22:42:46,unsteddyphoenix,"""B-baka!"""
07-11-2020T22:42:47,ShamusTheFox,"Indeed, it's just nice to have that reminder."
07-11-2020T22:42:49,Roughlandin,All his energy growing up went to evil instead of height
07-11-2020T22:43:18,Rainelover,Another reason why Clovis hates women: his female cousin is way taller than him
07-11-2020T22:43:46,Roughlandin,And she keeps stealing his boys!
07-11-2020T22:43:49,Roughlandin,...I mean!
07-11-2020T22:44:16,unsteddyphoenix,she probably bullied him
07-11-2020T22:44:23,unsteddyphoenix,Shes like 6'2 or something looks like
07-11-2020T22:44:39,Roughlandin,She always won when they played humans and keidran growing up
07-11-2020T22:45:04,Roughlandin,Clovis always had to be the human. His fur never did grow back right...
07-11-2020T22:45:13,Dadrobit,Would they play Humans and Keidran or Basitin and Keidran?
07-11-2020T22:45:16,CrRAR,haha
07-11-2020T22:45:30,Roughlandin,"Either way, the humans always lost"
07-11-2020T22:45:34,Rainelover,Clovis be having gay thoughts about Brutus
07-11-2020T22:45:48,Roughlandin,"Not gay if it's yer bro, bro"
07-11-2020T22:46:24,Roughlandin,Clovis is just a bromantic
07-11-2020T22:46:27,Rainelover,Or if you are secretly a man transformed into a woman
07-11-2020T22:46:51,Dadrobit,"Humans are actively enslaving Keidran, but it was the Basitins that were actively going to war with them and the humans interceded no? I have a feeling Basitin would be perceived as even worse than the Humans. But that's just speculation."
07-11-2020T22:47:23,CrRAR,"Brutus: “Wow, you’re so nice! You and Clovis’ sister would get along so swell!”"
07-11-2020T22:47:26,Dadrobit,S'pose it depends on how long ago that war was.
07-11-2020T22:47:32,CrRAR,“I’ll have to find her!”
07-11-2020T22:47:45,Roughlandin,Were the Basitins and the keidran at war? I thought very few people knew about them outside of the Isles?
07-11-2020T22:48:02,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah basitin tried to genoicide keidran as soon as they saw them
07-11-2020T22:48:06,Ordithus,"I remember there was talk of a war, but iirc it was long ago"
07-11-2020T22:48:16,Dadrobit,"Yeah, Basitins invaded the Keidran and were only stopped by the humans and the cold."
07-11-2020T22:48:29,Ordithus,part of why there's a basitin city in the north on the main continent
07-11-2020T22:48:40,steelabjur,"I thought it was Humans vs. Basitins, with the exception of the Northern Basitin group?"
07-11-2020T22:48:41,Roughlandin,Oh yeah. That does make sense
07-11-2020T22:48:51,unsteddyphoenix,Nah it was humans+keidran vs basitin
07-11-2020T22:48:52,Roughlandin,A basitin outpost that got left behind after the war
07-11-2020T22:49:05,RedEyesWheeler,Goodnight all
07-11-2020T22:49:08,Roughlandin,Night red
07-11-2020T22:49:12,unsteddyphoenix,The keidran were getting stomped because ofc they were its basitin
07-11-2020T22:49:14,Rainelover,So the basitins are the Japanese?
07-11-2020T22:49:14,KeefMcDerpface,night Red
07-11-2020T22:49:24,Dadrobit,o/ Red
07-11-2020T22:49:26,unsteddyphoenix,I think they are vaguely based on asian culture
07-11-2020T22:49:41,Roughlandin,With a mix of Greco-Roman
07-11-2020T22:50:01,Dadrobit,"Dunno if it's the same war, but Alabastar mentions ""The Great War ""that ended in 181 CE."
07-11-2020T22:50:17,Brocade,Brutus is naked :O
07-11-2020T22:50:17,Dadrobit,Alabaster
07-11-2020T22:50:31,Roughlandin,Every war is a Great War to the Basitins
07-11-2020T22:50:40,AspiringNoodle,Brutus seems attracted to Clovis' sister AND is nekkid
07-11-2020T22:50:46,AspiringNoodle,That seems like a dangerous combination
07-11-2020T22:50:49,Ordithus,Clovis insists on saving on the laundry
07-11-2020T22:50:51,Dadrobit,"Current year is 482, so 301 years ago."
07-11-2020T22:50:57,Roughlandin,"Hence why his lower half is just out of frame, Noodle"
07-11-2020T22:51:07,steelabjur,"Clovis thinking: ""Why doesn't he look at ME like that?!? Wait a minute, I mean..."""
07-11-2020T22:51:21,Rainelover,"The warrior culture, built upon honor and following orders upon command definitely sounds like pre-world war 2 japan"
07-11-2020T22:51:31,Paxpup,"Don't worry Clovis, one she realizes that you're now the younger sister 😈 ...well she'll teach you a few tricks! :ptv-snicker:"
07-11-2020T22:51:49,Paxpup,On how to get your man~
07-11-2020T22:51:52,CrRAR,ha

07-11-2020T22:52:20,Ordithus,Brutus blep adorable
07-11-2020T22:52:31,Channelfiction,I thought Adelaide would have them fight over him

07-11-2020T22:53:20,Paxpup,"I had to downgrade to the $5 tier, can someone suggest these three together again for more shenanigans?"
07-11-2020T22:53:20,steelabjur,"@Rainelover in their case, following orders is a biological imperative, they HAVE to. Sort of insect-like, imo."
07-11-2020T22:53:43,Rainelover,"Adelaide: no, you have to fight each other for it”"
07-11-2020T22:53:48,Roughlandin,I've already got a sequel where Clover takes him back to her crew. ...Her all female crew.

07-11-2020T22:54:47,AspiringNoodle,Makes me think
07-11-2020T22:54:50,unsteddyphoenix,I like that Clovis is gender ambiguous here
07-11-2020T22:54:51,ArkanaCat,those fox dom ladies
07-11-2020T22:54:52,Twokinds,I don't have a name for her yet

07-11-2020T22:54:57,AspiringNoodle,"Will Clovis' other ""sister"" show up and try to tempt Brutus into staying?"
07-11-2020T22:55:08,ShamusTheFox,"Even if you don't have a name, I love her."
07-11-2020T22:55:09,Ordithus,Whaaat you mean you don't have a full backstory for her already
07-11-2020T22:55:12,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,Her name is Pudding

07-11-2020T22:56:24,Roughlandin,That has got to be the finest pirate I have ever seen.
07-11-2020T22:56:29,Rainelover,"Nein, her name is Wilhelmina"
07-11-2020T22:56:47,ShamusTheFox,I would swab her deck any day.

07-11-2020T22:57:14,Dadrobit,Read that as VW Mike and was wondering where a Volkswagen came into the equation.
07-11-2020T22:57:19,ElvenHunter84,She looks like a Ruby to me
07-11-2020T22:57:26,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,yes give her a crown!!
07-11-2020T22:57:36,Rainelover,I would swab Raine’s Deck as soon as she asked me too

07-11-2020T22:58:05,unsteddyphoenix,A character with one eye covered named Jenny?
07-11-2020T22:58:06,KeefMcDerpface,Not a bad name.
