10-07-2020T00:00:37,CrRAR,bope
10-07-2020T00:00:42,CrRAR,*nope
10-07-2020T00:00:52,CrRAR,"ok, maybe it was the Apple III"
10-07-2020T00:01:04,CrRAR,article about dropping computer:
10-07-2020T00:01:06,CrRAR,https://www.techjunkie.com/apple-iii-drop/
10-07-2020T00:01:37,Dadrobit,"Yeah, just found it. I missed that gem."
10-07-2020T00:01:43,CrRAR,haha
10-07-2020T00:01:59,KeefMcDerpface,"hah, I forgot about that."
10-07-2020T00:02:39,KeefMcDerpface,"""If it don't work... Smack the devil out of it I guess."""
10-07-2020T00:03:01,Ordithus,percussive maintenance
10-07-2020T00:03:17,Ordithus,as old as cavemen
10-07-2020T00:03:24,CrRAR,indeed
10-07-2020T00:03:33,AspiringNoodle,"Wow... so even almost 40 years ago, Apple had the SAME design philosophy of ""form over function"""
10-07-2020T00:03:43,aeoronwah,lemme just pick up my $13500 computer and drop it to fix it
10-07-2020T00:03:44,KeefMcDerpface,yeah
10-07-2020T00:03:58,AspiringNoodle,"I'm sorry, Apple, but it's a flipping COMPUTER"
10-07-2020T00:04:09,AspiringNoodle,"We want it to run cool and well first, look pretty second..."
10-07-2020T00:04:20,WillsWord,"i prefer the nintendo method, just talk to it for a bit and then it just starts working again, good as new."
10-07-2020T00:04:21,KeefMcDerpface,"And they were heavy, no?"
10-07-2020T00:04:41,SageSaga,uhmm- Apple doesnt care about cooling-
10-07-2020T00:05:09,AspiringNoodle,"Yeah, that's pretty evidenced by the fact that they will let their computers run near the TJMax to squeeze every bit of performance out of the processor"
10-07-2020T00:05:17,CrRAR,I remember the 2009 era macbooks were insanely hot
10-07-2020T00:05:21,SageSaga,they didnt put a proper heat sync on their last laptop nor a fan-
10-07-2020T00:05:39,Ordithus,"my laptop doesn't have a fan, either!  silly Dell"
10-07-2020T00:05:41,AspiringNoodle,"Honestly, I can't recommend anything apple... outside of maybe their phones"
10-07-2020T00:05:45,KeefMcDerpface,They didn't put a fan?!
10-07-2020T00:05:58,AspiringNoodle,"Keef, you should see their modern laptops / all-in-ones"
10-07-2020T00:06:08,KeefMcDerpface,"Yeah, true."
10-07-2020T00:06:12,AspiringNoodle,"Even if they do put a fan in the system, it might not even actively cool the flippin processor"
10-07-2020T00:06:19,SageSaga,what about the ipadPro?
10-07-2020T00:06:28,SageSaga,ive heard almost nothing but good things about the iPad Pro
10-07-2020T00:06:30,AspiringNoodle,"Ah yeah, gotta extend it to tablets"
10-07-2020T00:06:30,Jeebuus,On one of their latest MacBook models they have the cooling set up where the fan doesn't blow air over the CPU heatsink.
10-07-2020T00:06:33,CrRAR,it fast
10-07-2020T00:06:40,AspiringNoodle,Apple is good for tablets and phones
10-07-2020T00:06:50,AspiringNoodle,But they make too many compromises on their computers
10-07-2020T00:06:53,CrRAR,plus now getting more multitask abilities
10-07-2020T00:06:57,Jeebuus,"Wireless charging, now they're doing wireless heat transfer."
10-07-2020T00:07:07,CrRAR,and the new cases have lil touchpads
10-07-2020T00:07:11,AspiringNoodle,What's extra stupid is that they don't sell their OS outside of their proprietary systems
10-07-2020T00:07:25,AspiringNoodle,"So if you want the OS that bad, you have 1 of two options"
10-07-2020T00:07:31,aeoronwah,hackintosh!
10-07-2020T00:07:34,AspiringNoodle,You either suck it up and buy one of their inferior computers
10-07-2020T00:07:42,KeefMcDerpface,"All-in-one. Yep, that's right, your all-in-one is also a stove top with how hot it gets."
10-07-2020T00:07:42,SageSaga,look- if ya got a nice enough heat sync with heat pipes ya might not need a fan at all!
10-07-2020T00:07:47,AspiringNoodle,"Which, by the way, they will attempt to gouge you every chance they get it if breaks"
10-07-2020T00:07:52,Jeebuus,"They want you to buy a Mac, so why bother making macOS available on other platforms?"
10-07-2020T00:07:59,AspiringNoodle,Or get a tech savvy friend help you set up a hackintosh
10-07-2020T00:08:00,SageSaga,but when your heat sync doesnt make proper contact with the CPU- you have a PROBLEM
10-07-2020T00:08:01,CrRAR,it's because they craft the OS to their hardware
10-07-2020T00:08:06,CrRAR,drivers and whatnot
10-07-2020T00:08:10,Jeebuus,Especially since it would require monumental amounts of effort on their part.
10-07-2020T00:08:11,Ordithus,"sink, sage, sink"
10-07-2020T00:08:13,CrimsonHelsing,One word: accessibility
10-07-2020T00:08:19,Ordithus,also
10-07-2020T00:08:21,aeoronwah,"Hey, passive cooling is somewhat feasible, you just have to actually mount it to the hardware"
10-07-2020T00:08:28,AspiringNoodle,Apple has an overinflated ego and sense of self-importance
10-07-2020T00:08:28,SageSaga,im typing fast so i can get back to drawing! give me a break!
10-07-2020T00:08:34,AspiringNoodle,They have an image to uphold
10-07-2020T00:08:37,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-reniderp:*[Neeeeerds!]
10-07-2020T00:08:50,AspiringNoodle,They don't want you running macOS on ANYTHING other than their own computers
10-07-2020T00:08:52,CrRAR,*Erlias adjust glasses*
10-07-2020T00:09:01,AspiringNoodle,"Sadly, the sheeple just blindly buy everything up"
10-07-2020T00:09:03,Jeebuus,With their move to arm processors I think Hackintosh builds might become even more endangered in the future.
10-07-2020T00:09:14,Jeebuus,Which stinks.
10-07-2020T00:09:24,AspiringNoodle,"And when they get charged $500 for a new motherboard when the old one might have been perfectly fine, they'll pay it"
10-07-2020T00:09:32,AspiringNoodle,"And be like, ""Oh boy, what great customer service!"""
10-07-2020T00:09:33,aeoronwah,I hope their arm processors fail and they just stay with x86-64 tbh
10-07-2020T00:10:10,CrRAR,The iPad Pros literally have been a testbed for it it seems like
10-07-2020T00:10:34,AspiringNoodle,"Lol, if Adobe takes a major performance loss thanks to the ARM processors, Apple will have dun goofed"
10-07-2020T00:10:39,CrRAR,As long as Apple nails software compatibility it should be okay
10-07-2020T00:10:41,Jeebuus,They probably won't fail unfortunately. Apple controls all of the platform and therefore they have the power to pull off a move like that successfully.
10-07-2020T00:10:59,AspiringNoodle,"Creative professionals won't be happy if they have to pay exorbitant prices for replacement computers, but then their productivity tanks xD"
10-07-2020T00:11:01,CrRAR,yeah noodle if they botch any of that it won't be good
10-07-2020T00:11:37,AspiringNoodle,"Because, here's the thing, ARM processors are RISC processors"
10-07-2020T00:12:13,Ordithus,Is Nyna gonna have to talk to her pet about rescuing any lost child?
10-07-2020T00:12:18,CrRAR,I wouldn't be surprised if for a while there's some sort of layer added to OSX to emulate x86 for apps that haven't benn rewritten yet
10-07-2020T00:12:29,Dadrobit,Just gonna pop in for a quick second to mention the Apple Refurbished store is a legitimate option for a decent computer for the price.
10-07-2020T00:12:31,AspiringNoodle,^ That right there will tank performance
10-07-2020T00:12:42,CrRAR,Like how wine does for Linux
10-07-2020T00:12:45,CrRAR,yeah
10-07-2020T00:12:47,AspiringNoodle,RISC processors can be powerful little monters- as long as you stay within the instruction set
10-07-2020T00:12:48,SageSaga,Nyna is pro child protecting and so is Kaylin
10-07-2020T00:12:59,CrRAR,It will cause some overhead
10-07-2020T00:13:04,Ordithus,d'aww
10-07-2020T00:13:15,AspiringNoodle,"The moment you need to emulate a CISC instruction because it doesn't exist for RISC, there will be a performance penalty"
10-07-2020T00:13:23,CrRAR,yup
10-07-2020T00:13:27,aeoronwah,Yeah
10-07-2020T00:13:46,AspiringNoodle,"And given how most programs today are probably written with CISC in mind (I'm eying you, Adobe), that's a potential iceberg"
10-07-2020T00:13:48,CrimsonHelsing,"Stoney's standing over the two of them like ""Rrrrrrrr..."""
10-07-2020T00:14:01,CrimsonHelsing,I can see it in his eyes
10-07-2020T00:14:43,AspiringNoodle,"So yeah, if Apple transitions over to their own RISC-based ARM processors, and Adobe can't program their suite for RISC, basically all of hollywood is gonna be very mad"
10-07-2020T00:15:21,AspiringNoodle,"And it might be the end of ""Mac is the standard for Adobe Suite creative work"""
10-07-2020T00:15:43,CrRAR,yeah but they know who they have to please
10-07-2020T00:16:07,AspiringNoodle,"I'm still prepping the popcorn, lol"
10-07-2020T00:16:10,aeoronwah,didn't microsoft already try emulating x86 on an arm chip with their surface lineup
10-07-2020T00:16:15,Jeebuus,"Apple is a 1+trillion dollars company,, they can make it happen."
10-07-2020T00:16:35,AspiringNoodle,Apple is a 1 trillion dollar company that can't make a product without any major flaws
10-07-2020T00:16:38,CrRAR,"probably, they have been working on Windows for ARM"
10-07-2020T00:16:44,Ordithus,I don't know what the compatibility is
10-07-2020T00:17:06,AspiringNoodle,Here's the potential risk of swapping over to ARM
10-07-2020T00:17:12,Jeebuus,"And yes they did. Didn't work well. Granted, Qualcomm Snapdragon SoCs can't really touch the stuff Apple puts out."
10-07-2020T00:17:30,Ordithus,the fancy surfaces do run x86
10-07-2020T00:17:59,Ordithus,doesn't prevent the screens from flickering :ctwokinds-flomad:
10-07-2020T00:18:00,aeoronwah,"yes, but emulating another instruction set is always going to be a hamper on your performance jeebuus"
10-07-2020T00:18:01,AspiringNoodle,"A long time ago, a processor manufacturer tried making a specialized chip"
10-07-2020T00:18:09,AspiringNoodle,I can't remember if it was Intel or IBM
10-07-2020T00:18:34,AspiringNoodle,What made this chip so powerful was that there were 4 steps during processing during which it could be running multiple instructions at the same time
10-07-2020T00:18:51,CrRAR,"Panel 3 Flora: ""I'm having the baby!"""

10-07-2020T00:33:04,Dadrobit,"Hmmm, missed that one. Alas."
10-07-2020T00:33:13,Ordithus,you'll see it soon!
10-07-2020T00:33:20,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-rainehappy:
10-07-2020T00:33:21,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,Plot Twist: Flora And Raine are the same person in a looper scenario!
10-07-2020T00:33:22,Dadrobit,\o/
10-07-2020T00:33:29,SageSaga,pretty sure PCs already have better SSDs than the PS5
10-07-2020T00:33:37,CrRAR,lol deathclaw
10-07-2020T00:33:38,AspiringNoodle,Not with what they're planning
10-07-2020T00:33:46,CrRAR,so then who is... pregnancy?
10-07-2020T00:33:49,AspiringNoodle,Sony is planning to have a baked-in hardware decoder for the SSD
10-07-2020T00:33:57,WillsWord,i personally think the squirrel is either a dragon or a god or something
10-07-2020T00:34:03,Jeebuus,"It's not the speeds that are better, really. It's the way data is handled before and during delivery"
10-07-2020T00:34:04,AspiringNoodle,Something that can decompress files at the hardware level
10-07-2020T00:34:38,Dadrobit,"The special sauce isn't just in the SSD, it's in the controllers for the data decompression and transfer that are gonna make the PS5 a big deal."
10-07-2020T00:34:51,Twokinds,I'm too tired to do the background tonight.
10-07-2020T00:34:52,SageSaga,I already know that- and we have PCIe 4 NVme drives with more capacity and when used with a high thread count CPU it can do everything the PS5  can and more
10-07-2020T00:34:53,Dadrobit,What noodle is saying
10-07-2020T00:34:58,KeefMcDerpface,okay Tom
10-07-2020T00:35:06,Twokinds,"I got up at 9am, so it's past bedtime for me"
10-07-2020T00:35:11,Dadrobit,"That's fine, Tom."
10-07-2020T00:35:12,CrimsonHelsing,oh ok Tom - yikes!
10-07-2020T00:35:16,AspiringNoodle,"Awwww, go to sleep Tom~"
10-07-2020T00:35:18,Dadrobit,I'll allow it.
10-07-2020T00:35:18,CrRAR,splendid progress
10-07-2020T00:35:21,AspiringNoodle,Sleepy bois need sleep
10-07-2020T00:35:23,CrimsonHelsing,yeah you better rest up
10-07-2020T00:35:27,SageSaga,i gotta be up early but i gotta at least get this to inking first T_T
10-07-2020T00:35:27,Jeebuus,"The controller can decompress massive quantities of data without slowdown, leaving the CPU free for other stuff. And once the data is decompressed, it takes less time to get to its destination."
10-07-2020T00:35:28,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nighty night Tom
10-07-2020T00:35:29,Ordithus,"alrighty, thanks for streamin the page!"
10-07-2020T00:35:34,FenceEqualizer,Have a good night Tom.
10-07-2020T00:35:36,CheddarCat,nigh nigh
10-07-2020T00:35:39,SageSaga,take care Tom thanks for joining me
10-07-2020T00:35:40,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Zeny <3
10-07-2020T00:35:40,Dadrobit,Ohhhh!!! Zen Zen?
10-07-2020T00:35:40,WillsWord,s Zen Sand garden
10-07-2020T00:35:43,WillsWord,HA
10-07-2020T00:35:43,CrimsonHelsing,"Sleep tight, Tom, and hoping to read this page tomorrow!"
10-07-2020T00:35:44,Ordithus,So Zen
10-07-2020T00:35:50,FenceEqualizer,Zen being Zen.
10-07-2020T00:35:56,CrRAR,"So, SO Zen"
10-07-2020T00:35:56,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,Good Night Tom <3 Thanks for Strimming <3 :ctwokinds-RainezZz:
10-07-2020T00:36:03,Dadrobit,I love this!
10-07-2020T00:36:07,KeefMcDerpface,bye Tom
10-07-2020T00:36:29,Ordithus,he can kill you with that rake
10-07-2020T00:36:41,KeefMcDerpface,"Zen, I hope you have a plan of getting of that rock and not ruining the sand."
10-07-2020T00:36:53,Ordithus,night Tom!
10-07-2020T00:36:58,Dadrobit,"""He can kill me with that take anytime"" - Marv probably"
10-07-2020T00:37:03,CrRAR,lol
10-07-2020T00:37:04,Dadrobit,Rake*
10-07-2020T00:37:07,Ordithus,true
10-07-2020T00:37:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,You know me to well
10-07-2020T00:37:14,Dadrobit,Also me probably
10-07-2020T00:37:19,KeefMcDerpface,The rake that takes.
10-07-2020T00:37:25,AspiringNoodle,"As an assassin, I'd hope he'd be able to kill someone with a rake"
10-07-2020T00:37:27,Dadrobit,"Great minds, Marv. Great minds."
10-07-2020T00:37:28,CrRAR,and forsakes
10-07-2020T00:37:45,AspiringNoodle,"So Sage, I pointed out one thing, Jeebus the other crucial part"
10-07-2020T00:37:47,FenceEqualizer,It's like you both are insync.
10-07-2020T00:38:05,AspiringNoodle,The PS5 plans on doing to data decompression what Nvidia did to raytracing
10-07-2020T00:38:21,Dadrobit,NSYNC? I wanna be Lance!
10-07-2020T00:38:30,AspiringNoodle,Building in specialized hardware that will provide far more performance than any generic hardware could hope to accomplish for a long time
10-07-2020T00:39:03,Jeebuus,Can't wait until these new consoles hit the market tbh.
10-07-2020T00:39:23,Jeebuus,I'll finally have a good reason to buy an RTX card now that ray tracing is going mainstream.
10-07-2020T00:39:26,AspiringNoodle,We're honestly probably heading for a hyper-specialized hardware future
10-07-2020T00:39:49,KeefMcDerpface,\o Night all. :ptv-sleepy:
10-07-2020T00:39:55,AspiringNoodle,"Over time, we got more of the general use components that make up a computer today, but now they're starting to add specialized hardware subsets to the general purpose parts"
10-07-2020T00:39:55,Ordithus,night keef
10-07-2020T00:39:58,w0lfmare,Night Tom!
10-07-2020T00:40:05,Dadrobit,o/ Keef
10-07-2020T00:40:09,AspiringNoodle,Night keef
10-07-2020T00:40:13,FenceEqualizer,Night Keef
10-07-2020T00:40:50,SageSaga,we already do that though- we just include them onboard
10-07-2020T00:42:07,AspiringNoodle,"What I mean is, we're going to identify certain subsets of operations that are extremely common, and then start creating hardware that does that exclusively"
10-07-2020T00:42:24,SageSaga,but then you end up with controller issues and traffic issues
10-07-2020T00:42:49,AspiringNoodle,"Maybe, maybe not"
10-07-2020T00:42:59,SageSaga,=_=
10-07-2020T00:43:12,AspiringNoodle,It'll probably fall to the developers to program for the hardware
10-07-2020T00:43:41,SageSaga,creating extra special parts on their own is a hardware thing not a software thing
10-07-2020T00:43:55,AspiringNoodle,Is both
10-07-2020T00:44:02,SageSaga,controllers and lanes are hardware
10-07-2020T00:44:31,Jeebuus,"Depending on what said controllers and such are meant to do, they may or may not require extra effort to program for."
10-07-2020T00:44:31,AspiringNoodle,Just because RTX video cards have ray tracing cores doesn't mean everything uses them
10-07-2020T00:44:48,Jeebuus,There's two sides to it like noodle said.
10-07-2020T00:44:50,AspiringNoodle,But they greatly increase raytracing capabilities of programs that code for them
10-07-2020T00:45:10,SageSaga,the devices - that control things on hardware- are hardware- they have to tell things to do things on a hardware level
10-07-2020T00:45:17,Ordithus,:csagesaga-nynastare:
10-07-2020T00:45:20,AspiringNoodle,The decompression hardware in the PS5's SSD will be specifically for the very compressed files that games use to save space
10-07-2020T00:45:22,SageSaga,you dont program them
10-07-2020T00:45:41,Jeebuus,You might have to program to utilize them properly.
10-07-2020T00:45:45,SageSaga,=_=
10-07-2020T00:46:02,SageSaga,you cant program them- they are hardware- you run programs on hardware
10-07-2020T00:46:11,AspiringNoodle,"Bah, I might have slipped up somewhere"
10-07-2020T00:46:14,SageSaga,yes
10-07-2020T00:46:23,AspiringNoodle,"Obviously you don't program the hardware, you program the software to take advantage of the hardware"
10-07-2020T00:46:41,SageSaga,that does not negate my issue at all
10-07-2020T00:46:52,SageSaga,you have to make software for hardware regardless
10-07-2020T00:47:16,SageSaga,of course if you specialize it then it will run better- but it wont run on everything- which sucks
10-07-2020T00:47:41,CrRAR,yeah
10-07-2020T00:47:45,AspiringNoodle,"Ohhhhh, no no no, I'm not saying parts will be specialized in an of themselves"
10-07-2020T00:48:01,AspiringNoodle,I meant that we'll start including hardware in addition to what we have that will be specialized
10-07-2020T00:48:26,SageSaga,and im saying we already do that- but you cant do that for everything or else you end up with a nightmare to combine together
10-07-2020T00:48:26,AspiringNoodle,"Like how GPU's now have ray tracing cores, deep-learning / AI cores, etc"
10-07-2020T00:49:06,SageSaga,the more separate things you have to deal with the more traffic you make - the more crashes you get when one thing comes in before another
10-07-2020T00:49:26,AspiringNoodle,Obviously you don't want specialized hardware for *everything*
10-07-2020T00:49:30,CrRAR,like the fact that games themselves on old consoles are optimized and developed specifically for the speed of the CPU clock
10-07-2020T00:49:36,AspiringNoodle,But there are intensive tasks that will benefit greatly
10-07-2020T00:50:02,CrRAR,crazy to think but when they attempt to emulate getting that right is important because the game will run faster/slower depending
10-07-2020T00:50:06,SageSaga,yeah but the same performance you get out of the new PS5 SSD is already achievable on PC
10-07-2020T00:50:19,AspiringNoodle,Not from what I've seen via the tech community
10-07-2020T00:50:35,SageSaga,it is rather new but it does already exist
10-07-2020T00:50:38,AspiringNoodle,This specialized hardware has the potential to surge past what PC is capable of when it comes to game load times
10-07-2020T00:50:45,SageSaga,and its thanks to PCIe4.0
10-07-2020T00:50:59,AspiringNoodle,"Sage, PCIe gen 4 is fast, but the problem is the data itself"
10-07-2020T00:51:15,SageSaga,and thats what high core and thread count CPUs are for
10-07-2020T00:51:21,AspiringNoodle,Games compress game files by a large degree to prevent the file size to blow to an absurd level
10-07-2020T00:51:26,Jeebuus,PCIe 4 doesn't solve the problem of decompression overhead and latency tho.
10-07-2020T00:51:39,SageSaga,it can decompile faster because of multicores and plenty of threads so traffic is not an issue
10-07-2020T00:52:03,AspiringNoodle,"Yeah, but you're forgetting the overhead that comes with decompressing it"
10-07-2020T00:52:42,Jeebuus,Having a controller that can not only decompress data without flooding the CPU but also send said data directly to vital parts of the system like the GPU immediately with very few hops can make a massive difference if taken advantage of.
10-07-2020T00:53:46,SageSaga,yeah i havent forgotten anything
10-07-2020T00:54:13,SageSaga,I have neglected to mention the price for this performance  on a pc is pretty stupid
10-07-2020T00:54:31,SageSaga,but its not impossible
10-07-2020T00:54:43,Jeebuus,"That too, although personally the freedom is worth the extra money."
10-07-2020T00:55:16,AspiringNoodle,I found the video I was looking for
10-07-2020T00:55:28,AspiringNoodle,I'm just searching for the part where Linus swallows his pride and explains how he was wrong
10-07-2020T00:55:44,SageSaga,you mean the old one from June?
10-07-2020T00:56:13,AspiringNoodle,yeah
10-07-2020T00:57:13,SageSaga,ive already seen it nothing there is going against what im talking about
10-07-2020T00:57:38,AspiringNoodle,Then I'm sticking to my guns
10-07-2020T00:57:48,SageSaga,also Tim Sweeny is a bag of dicks
10-07-2020T00:58:04,Jeebuus,Tim $weeney
10-07-2020T00:58:08,Jeebuus,ftfy
10-07-2020T00:58:10,SageSaga,hes not wrong about the tech and he can be happy about it- but he himself is a bag of dicks
10-07-2020T00:58:13,AspiringNoodle,Hardware designed solely to decompress game files before sending them off to be used will be far faster than sending the raw compressed files to the CPU to be decompressed then loaded in memory
10-07-2020T00:59:25,AspiringNoodle,"Dunno if this'll be backwards compatible though.  There are some games that are infamous for slow load times, even with the fastes SSDs"
10-07-2020T00:59:49,SageSaga,the biggest issue with the PS4 and PS4 Pro was their horrible load times
10-07-2020T00:59:51,AspiringNoodle,Would be so cool to see how much time the specialized hardware could chop off times
10-07-2020T00:59:54,SageSaga,so they had to do something
10-07-2020T01:00:06,AspiringNoodle,"Current gen is still using HDDs, aren't they? xD"
10-07-2020T01:00:09,SageSaga,sucks that it took such a horrible flaw for them to try something
10-07-2020T01:00:23,Ordithus,I 'member PS1 and PS2 load times
10-07-2020T01:00:29,Dadrobit,"Yeah, you can swap in an SSD, but HDD is standard."
10-07-2020T01:00:36,SageSaga,yeah but its no excuse- using a HDD on PC is faster than the PS4 Pro
10-07-2020T01:00:52,SageSaga,even a SSD on a PS4 Pro is slower than a HDD on pc
10-07-2020T01:00:59,AspiringNoodle,EEEEEEEEEEEEY?!?
10-07-2020T01:01:09,AspiringNoodle,"Wow, I know console hardware was eh, but not that eh"
10-07-2020T01:01:13,SageSaga,yeah it was horrible
10-07-2020T01:01:18,AspiringNoodle,Especially with how powerful they're touting this gen to be
10-07-2020T01:01:43,SageSaga,they have put out a lot of thing i suspect are just lies
10-07-2020T01:01:47,AspiringNoodle,"My xbox is a smidge slow, but that's because I have the first version of the One"
10-07-2020T01:01:54,Jeebuus,I mean the first half of this gen used SATAII over SATAIII
10-07-2020T01:01:55,SageSaga,or - more likely saying things without saying the trade offs
10-07-2020T01:02:08,AspiringNoodle,"Ironically, I don't think I even got this thing set up until the One S came out :ptv-laugh:"
10-07-2020T01:02:19,Jeebuus,"They had slow memory, and the CPU uArch was designed for low power stuff."
10-07-2020T01:02:24,Jeebuus,Not performance.
10-07-2020T01:02:46,SageSaga,"like remember when they said the new XBox was going to do 4k gaming, 60FPS, and raytracing?"
10-07-2020T01:03:03,SageSaga,it can probably do one of those each at a time XD
10-07-2020T01:03:07,Dadrobit,"Still excited about PS5 myself tho. Even with the PS4 being kinda ""bleh"" in specs upon release, they still managed some awesome and beautiful games. With PS5 shaping up to be very solid by even modern standards, they're gonna have some excellent shit."
10-07-2020T01:03:09,AspiringNoodle,"Bleh, first rule of marketing"
10-07-2020T01:03:15,AspiringNoodle,Set low expectations for any claims
10-07-2020T01:03:23,AspiringNoodle,4k? True 4k or 1080p upscaled?
10-07-2020T01:03:37,AspiringNoodle,"60 FPS, how scaled down will the graphics be to maintain this?"
10-07-2020T01:03:47,SageSaga,a bunch of the exclusive PS games are on PC now XD
10-07-2020T01:03:52,Jeebuus,"4k60fps? In first party titles, maybe."
10-07-2020T01:03:53,AspiringNoodle,Ray tracing: how much will it be included?
10-07-2020T01:03:57,SageSaga,Horizon Zero Dawn comes out like the end of this month?
10-07-2020T01:04:05,AspiringNoodle,"Yeah, I'm so excited :ptv-excited:"
10-07-2020T01:04:16,Dadrobit,"Saw that one, fuckin loved that game"
10-07-2020T01:04:34,Dadrobit,Very worth playing if you've got the dosh
10-07-2020T01:04:41,AspiringNoodle,"Then again, maybe I will start buying more console games.  Hearing that the PS5 will be backwards compatible to even the PS3 is a huge selling point for me"
10-07-2020T01:05:02,AspiringNoodle,"There are some franchises that continued after the PS2, so I never got to play them"
10-07-2020T01:05:06,SageSaga,someone commission me to draw sexy Kaylin so i can afford to get Horizon Zero dawn :P
10-07-2020T01:05:16,Ordithus,hmm
10-07-2020T01:05:46,Ordithus,when you put it that way
10-07-2020T01:05:49,Mihari,Lucky
10-07-2020T01:06:30,SageSaga,whaaaaat? T_T one of my novels got pushed back!
10-07-2020T01:06:31,Mihari,"Ah well, hehe, I still have plenty of games I need to finish first, first and primarly detroit"
10-07-2020T01:06:45,AspiringNoodle,"I want to play that one so bad, looks amazing"
10-07-2020T01:06:52,AspiringNoodle,"But I'll need to wait for the PS5, lol"
10-07-2020T01:06:59,SageSaga,PC
10-07-2020T01:07:04,Mihari,PS5 pffft :P
10-07-2020T01:07:11,Jeebuus,I need to finish hl:a
10-07-2020T01:07:14,AspiringNoodle,"Oh yeah, it is on PC"
10-07-2020T01:07:25,Jeebuus,Still leaves 80% of my library untouched lmao
10-07-2020T01:07:35,Mihari,I'm glad I'm atleast under 80%
10-07-2020T01:07:48,AspiringNoodle,I'm working my way through my backlog
10-07-2020T01:07:59,AspiringNoodle,"Now that I'm sick of every multiplayer game I've been playing, should be easier"
10-07-2020T01:08:25,Ordithus,":ptv-uneasy: so many long games, and I don't play often, so..."
10-07-2020T01:09:18,AspiringNoodle,I haven't been playing as much either
10-07-2020T01:09:28,AspiringNoodle,"Which is good, I played way too much before"
10-07-2020T01:09:48,AspiringNoodle,"Now I just need to tackle other forms of media, lol"
10-07-2020T01:09:55,SageSaga,maaan why is it im having 2-3 days of no pain- friday night work night- BAM! paaaaaain
10-07-2020T01:10:03,Ordithus,dang
10-07-2020T01:10:13,AspiringNoodle,bodies are weird man
10-07-2020T01:10:16,Dadrobit,"BRB, gotta chat with asphalt folks"
10-07-2020T01:10:20,AspiringNoodle,"I go to work one day, my right shoulder is killing me"
10-07-2020T01:10:30,AspiringNoodle,"I lay off it, and it still hurts slightly a week later"
10-07-2020T01:10:32,SageSaga,and i gotta get up early-
10-07-2020T01:10:46,AspiringNoodle,"Ah, right"
10-07-2020T01:10:46,SageSaga,theres only a 50% chance of my medicine stopping the pain-

10-07-2020T01:10:58,Ordithus,"good luck, man"
10-07-2020T01:10:58,SageSaga,T_T i might not be sleeping tonight
10-07-2020T01:11:34,Ordithus,I help
10-07-2020T01:11:36,Ordithus,:hammer::cw0lfmare-Paperflora:
10-07-2020T01:17:03,AspiringNoodle,"man, so close to completely destroying my youtube backlog"
10-07-2020T01:17:11,AspiringNoodle,I can no longer scroll the tabs :ptv-excited:
10-07-2020T01:21:20,Dadrobit,Back
10-07-2020T01:21:56,Dadrobit,"Man, lemme tell ya, few things make me quite as happy anymore as a cordially compliant vendor."
10-07-2020T01:23:41,Dadrobit,Rarely do I get out of a conversation with a lot of these folks who will argue to the end of the earth with me about the tiniest fucking thing.
10-07-2020T01:24:44,aeoronwah,Oh?
10-07-2020T01:25:31,Dadrobit,"Stuff like, ""sir, you're blocking the resident fast pass lane, could you please park on the other side of the street?"""
10-07-2020T01:26:23,Dadrobit,Rare is the time a vendor will simply comply without giving me at least some sass.
10-07-2020T01:26:38,aeoronwah,"WTF is a ""resident fast pass lane"""
10-07-2020T01:26:41,SageSaga,"""I thought we lived in america! IM SORRY! I THOUGHT THIS WAS AMERICA!"""
10-07-2020T01:26:54,Dadrobit,The guys who just pulled up have been nothing but polite so far. Love it
10-07-2020T01:27:02,Ordithus,nice
10-07-2020T01:27:37,SageSaga,I assume the Resident fast pass lane is you have an automated gate for the residence using a fast pass system?
10-07-2020T01:27:43,Ordithus,poor Henry is just distraught
10-07-2020T01:27:46,Dadrobit,Sage got it.
10-07-2020T01:27:58,aeoronwah,ahh
10-07-2020T01:28:02,AspiringNoodle,Must be so much nicer than dealing with customers who bitch and moan about having to wear masks
10-07-2020T01:28:30,AspiringNoodle,"It's like, really.  You have to wear that shit for maybe *5* minutes when you come here, longer elsewhere, but you can take them off when you leave"
10-07-2020T01:29:06,aeoronwah,people not wearing masks in public spaces is so dumb
10-07-2020T01:29:20,Dadrobit,"Noodle, I still deal with that. You must have missed me the other night when I got told to go fuck myself for wearing a mask and telling someone to enjoy the 4th of July."
10-07-2020T01:29:54,Dadrobit,Loooooots of Uber and Lyft drivers will give me shit for addressing them with a mask on.
10-07-2020T01:30:37,AspiringNoodle,"Imagine if you had free reign to tell them what you really think, lol"
10-07-2020T01:31:06,AspiringNoodle,"Seriously though, I swear half the time people get pissy about the masks is because they know that people working these positions can't talk back"
10-07-2020T01:31:32,Dadrobit,"Luckily I wear a mask. So I can mouth as many ""fuck you'd"" as I want so long as I don't vocalize it."
10-07-2020T01:31:46,Dadrobit,Yous*
10-07-2020T01:31:49,Ordithus,"""oops did I say that one out loud"""
10-07-2020T01:31:56,Dadrobit,Lol
10-07-2020T01:32:44,Dadrobit,I've had my fair share of faux pas moments with saying shit I shouldn't have.
10-07-2020T01:32:58,AspiringNoodle,"Ugh, professionalism >_>"
10-07-2020T01:33:09,AspiringNoodle,You can't even say the most common of swears without someone clutching their pearls
10-07-2020T01:33:47,AspiringNoodle,"When I learned that even ""damn"" is off the table, I rolled my eyes so hard"
10-07-2020T01:34:01,Dadrobit,Probably my favorite was telling a ln SUV full of drunk ass college girls that I was great at facials. Surprised I kept my job after that one. The look on the driver's face was worth the price of admission tho.
10-07-2020T01:34:03,AspiringNoodle,"Like, really? Damn?  A swear so not even sweary that it's not censored anywhere?!?"
10-07-2020T01:34:39,Werewing,I see Damn censorted all the time.
10-07-2020T01:34:44,AspiringNoodle,lolwut
10-07-2020T01:34:48,AspiringNoodle,where
10-07-2020T01:34:50,Dadrobit,"(I meant to say ""facial expressions"" but it came out wrong)"
10-07-2020T01:34:50,Werewing,"Hell, on the other hand, is pretty lenient."

10-07-2020T01:36:24,Dadrobit,"Swearing I have some leeway on depending on the client. Kids? Fuck it, I'm a sailor. Their parents who actually own the house? It depends. Some at school with free expression. Some want a professional concierge experience."

10-07-2020T01:38:28,AspiringNoodle,"I'd add an extra o, but that seems so... l00d"

10-07-2020T01:51:31,Dadrobit,"Just hopped over finally and got hit with some FFT music, so goooood."
10-07-2020T01:51:52,SageSaga,o_O
10-07-2020T01:51:57,Dadrobit,"Oh, wait, it's gone now, trying to update."
10-07-2020T01:52:06,SageSaga,its been a while since any FFT music played
10-07-2020T01:52:07,Ordithus,how far behind are you
10-07-2020T01:52:22,SageSaga,like we are talking like over an hour behind if you heard FFT
10-07-2020T01:52:27,Dadrobit,What year is it???
10-07-2020T01:52:33,Ordithus,3021
10-07-2020T01:53:02,Dadrobit,Now it's someone singing about the turning point of destiny.
10-07-2020T01:53:22,Dadrobit,"But I only catch 3 seconds of music every 6 seconds, so I dunno."
10-07-2020T01:53:25,SageSaga,that is up to date
10-07-2020T01:53:55,SageSaga,the song of Gohan throwing aside his doubts to end Cell and save the world
10-07-2020T01:54:07,Dadrobit,No shit?
10-07-2020T01:54:57,Dadrobit,I do not remember this.
10-07-2020T01:55:22,ZRO4825,Wasn't in our English version.
10-07-2020T01:55:34,ZRO4825,This is a fan-made cover of the song that played in the original japanese track~
10-07-2020T01:55:43,ZRO4825,"They DID however, use it in DBZ Abridged"
10-07-2020T01:56:26,Dadrobit,"Okay. I was like, I wouldn't put it past them to put an orchestral power ballad behind that moment in canon, I just couldn't recall it."

10-07-2020T02:03:22,SpazztasticKiwi,where did everybody go
10-07-2020T02:04:00,Dadrobit,I went outside to check on the vendors for a sec there. Dunno about anyone else.
10-07-2020T02:05:52,Dadrobit,???
10-07-2020T02:06:04,ZRO4825,I'm hoping that was a save/reload and not a crash. :o
10-07-2020T02:06:05,Dadrobit,New project?
10-07-2020T02:06:17,Dadrobit,Mmm
10-07-2020T02:06:40,SageSaga,touch and pen stopped working in the program workspace- it happens- saved and restarted to fix
10-07-2020T02:06:52,ZRO4825,Gotcha~
10-07-2020T02:07:12,SageSaga,i would like it if that problem could be solved but ive found no solutions to it ever in over 5 years
10-07-2020T02:20:11,sunblaze,good morning
10-07-2020T02:20:16,ZRO4825,Heyyo Sunblaze
10-07-2020T02:20:20,SageSaga,hey Sunblaze
10-07-2020T02:20:26,AspiringNoodle,h0i
10-07-2020T02:20:42,SageSaga,any idea what ya want drawn for this month?
10-07-2020T02:20:55,SageSaga,also - i might have to cut it soon even if im not done T_T
10-07-2020T02:21:01,sunblaze,darn I had an idea ealier this week but forgot to write it down :(
10-07-2020T02:21:04,SageSaga,too much pain and have to sleep soon
10-07-2020T02:21:30,SageSaga,im hoping i can take my medicine- hop in bed and the pain will go away and my exhaustion will lull me away-
10-07-2020T02:21:48,sunblaze,its on the tip of my tongue. let me think about it today and I am sure I can send it to you later today
10-07-2020T02:21:56,SageSaga,but it probably wont and i'll squirm around in pain for 8 hours and have to get up and go
10-07-2020T02:21:58,sunblaze,feeling that bad?
10-07-2020T02:22:28,SageSaga,yeah the pain is getting worse atm
10-07-2020T02:22:51,ZRO4825,:c
10-07-2020T02:23:03,AspiringNoodle,I'm goin' to bed now
10-07-2020T02:23:07,AspiringNoodle,"Hope you get some sleep, Sage"
10-07-2020T02:23:24,SageSaga,take care Noodle
10-07-2020T02:24:26,Werewing,Why is Sage in pain?
10-07-2020T02:25:09,SageSaga,because Sage has medical issues and lacks the money and time to fix them
10-07-2020T02:29:08,SageSaga,if i get one of the surgeries it could put me in bed only for 2-3 weeks- unfortunately thats like taking a month off work which i cant really afford to do
10-07-2020T02:30:09,sunblaze,have you tried a crowdfunding page jsut for that surgery-month?
10-07-2020T02:31:32,SageSaga,no because then people will wanna know what the procedure is and its not something i wanna talk about
10-07-2020T02:33:25,sunblaze,ah fair enough
10-07-2020T02:34:41,SageSaga,theres a small chance it will heal on its own eventually- it just needs to stop hurting long enough to heal- which i thought was happening finally till about 4 hours ago
10-07-2020T02:41:40,SageSaga,of course i felt like it was healing like that 4 months ago too - and 4 months before that- hmm- going on for a year and 2 months now
10-07-2020T02:44:39,DarthRexKing,RWBY OST good OST.

10-07-2020T13:06:13,Twokinds,HOW
10-07-2020T13:07:20,Ordithus,"coloring is usually done by someone else, they might have another artist clean it up, too.  Still crazy"
10-07-2020T13:07:36,Ordithus,work 100+ hours?
10-07-2020T13:07:37,Twokinds,"Yeah, it's just writing, sketching, and inking. But STILL."
10-07-2020T13:07:37,iliar,"Today's sketch makes me think. If I'm noracard it, then technically I will get 3 color art for one price. Sounds like a profitable deal."

10-07-2020T13:08:33,Twokinds,I must be doing something wrong. I need to learn their workflow.

10-07-2020T14:32:12,CrRAR,Beware bananas
10-07-2020T14:32:40,SageSaga,i should probably at some point do a scene where Kaylin jumps from shadow to shadow to abuse the boost

10-07-2020T14:33:56,SageSaga,i just said she gets a speed boost in shadows
10-07-2020T14:34:01,Werewing,"Can she run fast enough to propel herself over chasms? Or run on water, sonic style?"
10-07-2020T14:34:08,Werewing,"Oh, the shadows GIVE the boost."
10-07-2020T14:34:13,BadFoMo,Cheeseing their reality? ...I aprove!
10-07-2020T14:34:16,Werewing,I misread that.
10-07-2020T14:34:27,AspiringNoodle,Kaylin has Shadowstep confirmed
10-07-2020T14:34:33,AspiringNoodle,c:
10-07-2020T14:34:44,SageSaga,so if she jumps shed maintain that speed instead of slowing down
10-07-2020T14:35:14,CrRAR,Like portals but less portaly
10-07-2020T14:35:28,SageSaga,yeah- except not at all like portals

10-07-2020T14:43:56,SageSaga,yes Necro is a specialty for a wizard
10-07-2020T14:44:37,AspiringNoodle,Excellent
10-07-2020T14:51:37,Sclimshady,Too bad neko isnt a specialty for wizard
10-07-2020T14:52:09,Werewing,"Eh, maybe in homebrew. I have seen many games with mages with cats and cat-themed magical girls."
10-07-2020T14:52:28,SageSaga,Cat is an option for a Demi Race
10-07-2020T14:52:30,Werewing,Would Anders from Dragon Age count as a Neko-Wizard?
10-07-2020T14:52:38,AspiringNoodle,Alfheim Online had the Cait Sith race :P
10-07-2020T14:52:48,AspiringNoodle,Literally just fairies with cat ears / tails and the ability to tame beasts
10-07-2020T14:53:12,Sclimshady,"Or even better,  nekro,  reanimate the dead into cat girls"

10-07-2020T15:48:41,Ordithus,I will assume it is an old war injury from saving a helpless puppy
10-07-2020T15:48:42,SageSaga,my issue is i just barely make enough money to save up so its gonna take a while- or a lot of extra work
10-07-2020T15:49:57,SageSaga,and since its not life threatening- just sanity threatening- which as we know in america- we dont care about mental health
10-07-2020T15:50:00,Rosscoe,"I need to get x-rays down on my lower back again, and one for my one knee, no docotors around even if we are possiblely removing the state of pandic to norm status for the maritimes up here."
10-07-2020T15:50:03,Rosscoe,still lack of doctors
10-07-2020T15:50:37,SageSaga,so yeah i pretty much need to just deal with it till the pandemic is over to get in to a hospital

10-07-2020T23:17:32,Ordithus,chillin before bed
10-07-2020T23:17:49,AspiringNoodle,I'm currently having my mind *blown* by SOMA

10-07-2020T23:18:12,AspiringNoodle,"Also, so glad I chose safe mode, lol.  The game is still plenty terrifying O_O"

10-07-2020T23:19:18,Ordithus,fun?
10-07-2020T23:19:25,AspiringNoodle,I'm having my mind blown over the philosophical implications of the human conscience and what it means to be human
10-07-2020T23:19:40,AspiringNoodle,"You play Simon Jarrett, a man who was in a car accident that left him with a brain injury"
10-07-2020T23:19:42,Ordithus,that sounds like something a robot would say
10-07-2020T23:19:51,AspiringNoodle,We're getting there ;)
10-07-2020T23:21:45,AspiringNoodle,"On May 2, 2015, Simon went to an office complex to get a brain scan done by Dr. Mushi (not a doctor at the time, this brain scan was part of his thesis work)"
10-07-2020T23:22:22,AspiringNoodle,"The idea is, if they scan the pathways inside the brain, they could better understand the damage, and hopefully craft a personalized treatment to help repair the brain"
10-07-2020T23:22:52,AspiringNoodle,"You sit down in the chair to get the brain scan done, and the next thing you know you're in a different room, different chair"
10-07-2020T23:23:08,AspiringNoodle,"And now apparently it's the year flipping 2103,a nd yer a robot Simon"
10-07-2020T23:23:37,Ordithus,that's a lot of sleep.
10-07-2020T23:24:04,AspiringNoodle,"You later meet Carl Semken, a man who's a machine but thinks he's a man"
10-07-2020T23:24:17,AspiringNoodle,You can find his corpse nearby in a hall
10-07-2020T23:24:46,AspiringNoodle,"Later you meet Catherine, whose also a machine but is aware she's a machine and she cracks open this whole brain scan debacle"
10-07-2020T23:25:17,AspiringNoodle,"Quite literally, those brain scans creates a complete copy of your consciousness, memories and all"
10-07-2020T23:26:05,AspiringNoodle,"Oh yeah, there's also murder machines and corpses running around trying to kill you"
10-07-2020T23:26:07,Ordithus,"""I did not consent to being robo cloned!"""
10-07-2020T23:26:29,AspiringNoodle,There's apparently an AI gone rogue called the WAU
10-07-2020T23:26:43,AspiringNoodle,It's infesting this entire underground complex you've found yourself in
10-07-2020T23:26:58,AspiringNoodle,And is the reason behind some of the things trying to kill you
10-07-2020T23:28:12,AspiringNoodle,"Errr, meant to say Underwater, lol"
10-07-2020T23:28:47,AspiringNoodle,Apparently we're somewhere in the Atlantic off the coast of Northwest Africa
10-07-2020T23:29:26,AspiringNoodle,So Ord...

10-07-2020T23:29:57,AspiringNoodle,Could we call it human?

10-07-2020T23:30:43,AspiringNoodle,"""It"" would probably be just as confused as the original"
10-07-2020T23:30:48,AspiringNoodle,"So that doesn't help, now does it?"
10-07-2020T23:31:54,Ordithus,"Pragmatically, is there any functional difference? Talks like a human, acts like a human"
10-07-2020T23:33:02,AspiringNoodle,That's what I think
10-07-2020T23:34:12,AspiringNoodle,Oh GOODY
10-07-2020T23:34:23,AspiringNoodle,"Now there's a thing called the ""continuity"""
10-07-2020T23:34:29,AspiringNoodle,And it's enough for people to kill themselves
10-07-2020T23:34:41,Ordithus,well that is just silly
10-07-2020T23:34:43,AspiringNoodle,$5 says its related to the brain scans
10-07-2020T23:36:03,Ordithus,somewhat like the star trek transporters - and the horrifying thing that they actually *destroy* the person on one end and continue on the other
10-07-2020T23:36:15,Ordithus,forming an exact replica
10-07-2020T23:36:36,Ordithus,"the ""new"" person didn't even notice it, to them they've always been them"
10-07-2020T23:37:06,Ordithus,"but... was it *really* one stream of conciousness, or did one end and a new one begin"
10-07-2020T23:38:11,AspiringNoodle,"Not sure, according to Catherine it's possible for both copies to exist"
10-07-2020T23:38:29,AspiringNoodle,"The scan would be uploaded to the ARK, a virtual world to act as a survival strategy for mankind"
10-07-2020T23:38:31,Ordithus,there was an episode of star trek with that as the plot
10-07-2020T23:38:34,AspiringNoodle,But the human is able to keep on going
10-07-2020T23:38:34,Ordithus,two Rikers
