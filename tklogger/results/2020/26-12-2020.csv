26-12-2020T01:41:32,AspiringNoodle,Tonight was fun
26-12-2020T01:43:56,NinoGD,Noice
26-12-2020T01:44:14,AspiringNoodle,./s
26-12-2020T01:44:53,CrRAR,What hath‚Äôppened noodle?
26-12-2020T01:55:12,AspiringNoodle,The one coworker who was on two-weeks notice no-showed today
26-12-2020T01:55:36,AspiringNoodle,And then I let my manager go home since he has to be back in at 4 this morning
26-12-2020T01:56:04,AspiringNoodle,"I was supposed to help train one of our new hires tonight, and then I forgot that it was the day after Christmas"
26-12-2020T01:56:06,AspiringNoodle,And a Saturday
26-12-2020T01:56:10,AspiringNoodle,Holy fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu-
26-12-2020T01:57:00,AspiringNoodle,Then I looked at next weeks schedule and noticed that all 3 days I'm schedule I was given the worst shift for each day.
26-12-2020T01:58:37,AspiringNoodle,It will have been 1.5 months since these horrible shifts started.  And at this rate they aren't gonna end anytime soon.  Sooooooo my determination to hand in MY two weeks got reignited
26-12-2020T01:58:51,CrRAR,Remember the days when holidays felt like life magically paused?
26-12-2020T02:01:39,AspiringNoodle,Here's the sad thing...
26-12-2020T02:01:58,AspiringNoodle,"The entire time I've been working here, I've only seen TWO people do the full two-weeks."
26-12-2020T02:02:15,AspiringNoodle,One coworker who transferred to our store and later requested a transfer back to their location.
26-12-2020T02:02:33,CrRAR,haha oh jeez
26-12-2020T02:02:43,AspiringNoodle,And an assistant manager who realized he didn't want this job.
26-12-2020T02:03:18,AspiringNoodle,"Every single other person makes it maybe 2 - 3 shifts, and then just no-shows."
26-12-2020T02:03:46,AspiringNoodle,What compounds this problem is that they're usually the people doing 4+ days a week.
26-12-2020T02:04:08,AspiringNoodle,I've also seen too many people just repeatedly no-show and basically quit without saying anything.
26-12-2020T02:04:34,CrRAR,"Yeah, depending how much you value an endorsement, the two weeks thing isn‚Äôt compulsory at that point"
26-12-2020T02:04:50,AspiringNoodle,"In short.  Most people who quit this job don't make it the full two weeks after announcing, or just stop showing up."
26-12-2020T02:04:57,CrRAR,"Courtesy, but not compulsory"
26-12-2020T02:05:04,AspiringNoodle,I plan to serve out my two weeks
26-12-2020T02:05:33,CrRAR,"Yeah, it‚Äôs good practice"
26-12-2020T02:05:38,AspiringNoodle,"I feel bad doing it JUST as we're getting new people, and we just had a fresh quit, but at this point the job isn't worth the money to me, and I want to get out now that it seems to be on the upswing :|"
26-12-2020T02:05:47,CrRAR,respectable
26-12-2020T02:06:22,AspiringNoodle,Which reminds me.  I need to keep an eye on my bank account.
26-12-2020T02:06:38,CrRAR,not that evidently the place will even benefit by the added notice you provide ;_;
26-12-2020T02:06:48,SpazztasticKiwi,üõå
26-12-2020T02:06:59,CrRAR,Nite spazz
26-12-2020T02:07:03,CrRAR,:v:
26-12-2020T02:07:16,AspiringNoodle,Night~
26-12-2020T02:07:27,AspiringNoodle,"If anything, it'll keep my one coworker happy."
26-12-2020T02:07:39,CrRAR,yeah
26-12-2020T02:07:51,AspiringNoodle,Recently out of prison for goofy juice stuff.  He's sober for now.
26-12-2020T02:08:22,AspiringNoodle,He is planning on getting a new job once he doesn't need to wait on the state for stuff he needs.  But for now he only sticks around because he's able to get overtime
26-12-2020T02:08:48,CrRAR,It‚Äôs a start
26-12-2020T02:08:51,AspiringNoodle,"He's sober now*.  Hasn't touched booze in a long time, haha."
26-12-2020T02:09:28,AspiringNoodle,But this place is SCREWED if he leaves.
26-12-2020T02:09:53,AspiringNoodle,"I don't think my one coworker will be able to go back for 40 hour-weeks on night shift anytime soon, and he's the only other guy who can do it."
26-12-2020T02:10:52,CrRAR,they‚Äôll figure it out I guess
26-12-2020T02:10:58,AspiringNoodle,"But until we get more people, we won't be able to go back to 24/7.  And if we do, we'll have to stop AGAIN if he leaves and the other guy can't take over."
26-12-2020T02:11:31,AspiringNoodle,"As it stands, we don't run 24/7, and this guy is easily eating 46+ hours a week."
26-12-2020T02:12:04,AspiringNoodle,"Soooooo, yeah..."
26-12-2020T02:13:55,AspiringNoodle,"Long story short, I feel bad about leaving, but I just need to learn that some problems are not mine to worry about"
26-12-2020T02:14:17,AspiringNoodle,And there are times where I need to put myself first.
26-12-2020T02:15:07,AspiringNoodle,"Also, if I don't see a $100 or so deposit in my bank account by the end of the year I'm gonna be pissed @w@"
26-12-2020T02:15:28,CrRAR,Is that the hazard bonus?
26-12-2020T02:16:00,CrRAR,"Yeah, when it feels like just a tredmill of torment it‚Äôs not worth it"
26-12-2020T02:17:54,CrRAR,"btw, I just remembered seeing a pic of this lil dude:"
26-12-2020T02:17:59,CrRAR,https://i.redd.it/bqmya1wp8f061.jpg
26-12-2020T02:18:40,SonOfGoku,That's Noodle's profile picture
26-12-2020T02:18:42,AspiringNoodle,"When the company announced the end of the hourly bonus for working during the pandemic, they said around Christmas we'd be getting a $100 bonus (for part timers), and more for full timers"
26-12-2020T02:19:50,AspiringNoodle,Got a paycheck on 12/11 for $152 and change... trying to remember how many hours I worked that week...
26-12-2020T02:20:18,AspiringNoodle,That is WELL into the period of BS
26-12-2020T02:20:49,CrRAR,ah
26-12-2020T02:21:25,AspiringNoodle,Maybe it was a week where I had 1 less day?
26-12-2020T02:21:53,AspiringNoodle,"I can't remember, the week I worked for that paycheck would've been the very start of the month."
26-12-2020T02:22:48,CrRAR,Yeah it feels dumb when you have to spend time figuring out the math that its someone elses‚Äô job to figure out
26-12-2020T02:23:24,AspiringNoodle,"Hmmm, maybe that was the week I screwed up the timestamp, haha"
26-12-2020T02:23:32,CrRAR,It‚Äôs like don‚Äôt waste more of my time working out administative details of my own job
26-12-2020T02:23:50,AspiringNoodle,Because one day I apparently didn't clock in.
26-12-2020T02:23:59,CrRAR,Ah
26-12-2020T02:24:02,AspiringNoodle,And the following week there was an extra $65 and change
26-12-2020T02:24:22,AspiringNoodle,"And if I add that back into the previous paycheck, that's $217 or so, and that's right in line with what' I've been getting."
26-12-2020T02:24:52,CrRAR,Yeah I remember those days when a error just corrected in the next paycycle
26-12-2020T02:25:08,CrRAR,My college job was like that
26-12-2020T02:25:23,AspiringNoodle,And I don't recalled a job as low paying as mine taking almost 35% in taxes ;P
26-12-2020T02:25:44,AspiringNoodle,I'm hoping with Instacart I'll have more energy.
26-12-2020T02:26:19,AspiringNoodle,"I don't like sleeping for 12 hours a day, and then stressing before a shift because it's potentially 10 hours with over a 1/3 of the time being spent alone."
26-12-2020T02:26:30,CrRAR,Does that have to do with if you claimed yourself as a dependent or not?
26-12-2020T02:26:51,AspiringNoodle,Not a dependent.  My tax rate should be ~18%
26-12-2020T02:26:57,CrRAR,Like you get to choose when you start a job?
26-12-2020T02:27:00,AspiringNoodle,At least at my income.
26-12-2020T02:27:26,CrRAR,No but you usually get to pick when you fill out the tax thing
26-12-2020T02:27:36,CrRAR,When you start a job
26-12-2020T02:28:31,CrRAR,"One way more gets deducted and you get it back when you file taxes usually, the other way ya just pay more upfront"
26-12-2020T02:29:32,CrRAR,I guess once you make so much paying more just makes sense in tax up front is better cuz eventually salary is enough where you don‚Äôt get a refund
26-12-2020T02:29:47,CrRAR,Ya just end up owing the tax man
26-12-2020T02:30:02,AspiringNoodle,My job automatically deducts state / federal taxes
26-12-2020T02:30:24,AspiringNoodle,During tax season I'll get a form from them with the relevant information for the tax year.
26-12-2020T02:30:27,CrRAR,So more upfront is like just money you won‚Äôt see again anyway eventually
26-12-2020T02:30:52,AspiringNoodle,Last year I actually had a NEGATIVE tax rate
26-12-2020T02:31:16,AspiringNoodle,Low-income tax credit since I started late that year and didn't really make enough money to tax.
26-12-2020T02:31:54,AspiringNoodle,"Government basically saying, ""Awww, thanks for working champ!  Here's some money for your effort, continue being a productive member of society~'"
26-12-2020T02:32:38,CrRAR,yupp
26-12-2020T02:34:20,AspiringNoodle,"So yeah, I'm on the lookout for a $80 - $100 extra payment from work"
26-12-2020T02:34:41,AspiringNoodle,"Because if I don't get that, then I can basically presume that the bonus they mentioned was a LIE"
26-12-2020T02:35:17,CrRAR,We got one I feel like it took a month or two

26-12-2020T02:35:39,AspiringNoodle,I'm still waiting
26-12-2020T02:36:06,CrRAR,Maybe final cycle of 2020?
26-12-2020T02:36:22,CrRAR,Not that fiscal years work like that
26-12-2020T02:37:50,AspiringNoodle,"We'll see, haha"
26-12-2020T02:38:06,AspiringNoodle,"That said, if I don't get that bonus during my 2 weeks, I'll feel less guilty @w@"

26-12-2020T20:58:58,ThingsAreMoving,substituting cow's milk with goat's milk is one way of handling that. But the taste is a bit different and not suitable for everybody
26-12-2020T20:59:14,RimaDraws,ew no thanks i rather have soy or almond milk
26-12-2020T20:59:33,ZapiliDver,Good gaot milk doesn't has that bad odor
26-12-2020T20:59:43,ZapiliDver,But it's hard to find such one
26-12-2020T20:59:52,ZapiliDver,*goat
26-12-2020T20:59:58,ThingsAreMoving,it's an acquired taste
26-12-2020T21:00:03,ProsePro7,Unsweet almond milk vanilla
26-12-2020T21:00:11,RimaDraws,yes plz

26-12-2020T21:01:51,RimaDraws,worth the risk

26-12-2020T22:11:02,Dadrobit,(Perhaps it is a sign....)
26-12-2020T22:11:36,KeefMcDerpface,The game is telling you you are not worthy to play it.

26-12-2020T22:31:44,Dadrobit,1080 and I get a locked 144

26-12-2020T22:42:06,Dadrobit,"That game's so buggy, it's fucking with my other games..."

26-12-2020T22:43:42,AspiringNoodle,But that game was clearly pushed out a year too early.
26-12-2020T22:45:30,AspiringNoodle,CDPR was also probably a tad too optimistic on having that game run on PC and next gen console AND current gen console.
26-12-2020T22:46:04,AspiringNoodle,"Dadro, bugs aside, what are your impressions of Cyberpunk?"
26-12-2020T22:58:04,Dadrobit,"Sorry, was in raid."
26-12-2020T22:58:09,Dadrobit,Ehhhhh
26-12-2020T22:58:16,Dadrobit,It's okay
26-12-2020T22:59:17,Dadrobit,"A good 70% of all quests are the same 2 or 3 quests, just with different areas against slightly different enemies."
