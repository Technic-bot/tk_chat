19-08-2020T08:15:24,AspiringNoodle,"Alright, Kaspersky trial be up"
19-08-2020T08:15:27,AspiringNoodle,Time to try Bitdefender
19-08-2020T08:18:34,AspiringNoodle,"Lol, oh Bitdefender"
19-08-2020T08:19:03,AspiringNoodle,"They ask basically the same amount as Kaspersky, but if you buy 3 years of protection, you save an extra TEN DOLLARS compared to Kaspersky"
19-08-2020T08:20:01,AspiringNoodle,I could get an order of 10 wings with that money *maddiebigeyes.jpg*
19-08-2020T08:29:48,AspiringNoodle,"Well, I like the UI"

19-08-2020T08:48:26,TerraTheWizard,"what os you on? if you're on win10, defender does just as good a job as the paid ones these days"
19-08-2020T09:05:24,AspiringNoodle,"win 10, but some stuff still snuck on"
19-08-2020T09:05:34,AspiringNoodle,Trying Bitdefender atm
19-08-2020T09:14:36,CrRAR,Yeah bitdefender was a bit of a old school sleeper-hit of an AV
19-08-2020T09:14:59,CrRAR,They've always upheld a pretty strong reputation.
19-08-2020T09:15:45,CrRAR,No PR catastrophies... yet. c:
19-08-2020T09:16:36,AspiringNoodle,"As far as antivirus goes (for the home), the two top contenders are Kaspersky and Bitdefender"
19-08-2020T09:16:58,AspiringNoodle,They're usually trading places in the #1 spot
19-08-2020T09:31:21,CrRAR,"Yeah, afaik, they've always been no-nonsense. I used it pretty exclusively before Malwarebytes became known, then MB kinda declined in quality a bit. BD did modernize quite well. I liked their old interface(s) too."
19-08-2020T09:32:00,AspiringNoodle,I liked Kaspersky so much that I bought 3-years of protection
19-08-2020T09:32:19,AspiringNoodle,"Their interface is good, I just like BD's darker palette"
19-08-2020T09:32:35,AspiringNoodle,Like... really like it
19-08-2020T09:32:53,AspiringNoodle,"If I am thoroughly satisfied with their service, I may just end up buying 3 years from them :ptv-uneasy:"

19-08-2020T14:30:53,CrimsonQuill,What did Bagheera do with the Box?
19-08-2020T14:53:35,CrimsonQuill,...it's awfully quiet...

19-08-2020T15:13:52,AspiringNoodle,Is okay <3
19-08-2020T15:15:03,AspiringNoodle,You guys ever watch Happy Death Day?
19-08-2020T15:15:58,CrimsonQuill,"No, but I read the plot on wikipedia because it didn't seem like my kind of film."
19-08-2020T15:16:08,AspiringNoodle,Is a black comedy slasher
19-08-2020T15:16:20,CrimsonQuill,I know about that
19-08-2020T15:16:24,AspiringNoodle,"Groundhog Day, but day resets when she dies <3"
19-08-2020T15:16:48,AspiringNoodle,"Best part is that as she realizes what's going on, she embraces it"
19-08-2020T15:17:08,AspiringNoodle,"Quite a few deaths where she went, ""You have got to be kidding me.""  Because the killer comes out of nowhere and always seems to know where she is"
19-08-2020T15:18:06,AspiringNoodle,Not sure if they'll do a third film...  2nd one had a pretty good explanation for the time loop
19-08-2020T15:21:15,CrimsonQuill,Meh
19-08-2020T15:21:32,CrimsonQuill,I prefer Edge of Tomorrow loopwise
19-08-2020T15:24:05,AspiringNoodle,Tom Cruise is also :ok_hand:
19-08-2020T15:28:09,AspiringNoodle,"Quill, you ever see The Butterfly Effect?"
19-08-2020T15:28:14,CrimsonQuill,Yep
19-08-2020T15:28:17,CrimsonQuill,Until Dawn
19-08-2020T15:28:21,CrimsonQuill,Henry Stickmin
19-08-2020T15:28:32,CrimsonQuill,Undertale
19-08-2020T15:28:44,AspiringNoodle,"So yeah, Happy Death Day is basically Edge of Tomorrow + The Butterfly Effect in most regards"
19-08-2020T15:28:51,CrimsonQuill,I see
19-08-2020T15:28:58,AspiringNoodle,Death restarts the protagonist to the start of the day
19-08-2020T15:29:02,CrimsonQuill,I remember the plot well enough from wikipedia
19-08-2020T15:29:04,AspiringNoodle,Changes add up over time
19-08-2020T15:29:19,AspiringNoodle,"In The Butterfly Effect, the change was his memories in his brain"

19-08-2020T15:29:42,AspiringNoodle,"With Happy Death Day, the injuries that cause her death leave scar tissues in the affected organs"

19-08-2020T15:29:55,CrimsonQuill,I see Aspiring
19-08-2020T15:30:04,AspiringNoodle,"So the movie is a race against the clock.  Yes, she has ""infinite"" deaths, but eventually the damage will be too much and she'll die for good"
19-08-2020T15:30:27,CrimsonQuill,Adds a nice twist to the loop.
19-08-2020T15:30:53,AspiringNoodle,"Is a nice juxtaposition to her flippant attitude of earlier deaths where they were legit ""OH COME ON!"" moments"
19-08-2020T15:31:23,AspiringNoodle,"Camping in a bush with black clothing, camo face paint, and some twigs to spy on someone you suspect?"

19-08-2020T17:03:32,AspiringNoodle,Retail's problem is that they have too many carrots everywhere
19-08-2020T17:03:47,AspiringNoodle,"They just *load* the game with stuff to do / earn, but they don't particularly make *good* content"
19-08-2020T17:04:20,AspiringNoodle,"It's part of the reason why BFA is burning people out.  There's goodies everywhere, but they're so much RNG / Grind / timegating or some combination of the three that people just give up"
19-08-2020T17:06:21,AspiringNoodle,"I am playing a bit of Classic today, is more fun"
19-08-2020T17:06:44,AspiringNoodle,"The gameplay is more punishing in almost every aspect, but it's a true game at heart.  Not a ""repeat X activity 50 times and maybe get a toy"""
