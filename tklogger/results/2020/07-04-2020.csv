07-04-2020T00:05:55,SpazztasticKiwi,and that thing sounds like all sorts of nope
07-04-2020T00:06:14,SpazztasticKiwi,"you hear that, and you just don‚Äôt go outside again"
07-04-2020T00:08:16,CrRAR,"Yeah it rattled us for sure, I think there were 4-5 of us, but we all ran quick"
07-04-2020T00:08:36,SpazztasticKiwi,and another teen was arrested and charged for terrorism for Coronavirus threats
07-04-2020T00:09:39,CrRAR,as if there weren't enough things kids were getting themselves into trouble over on the internet
07-04-2020T00:13:06,AspiringNoodle,"Honestly, feels like the internet needs to be age restricted :/"

07-04-2020T00:42:49,SpazztasticKiwi,a man was arrested for taping himself licking a row of deodorant
07-04-2020T00:43:29,SpazztasticKiwi,and another was arrested for coughing on a lady who asked him to back up as respect for social distancing in a store
07-04-2020T00:44:24,SpazztasticKiwi,"and still another lady was arrested for harassment, assault, and intimidation of two Chinese women after being caught accusing them of bringing and spreading the virus"
07-04-2020T00:46:00,AspiringNoodle,I would personally spit on the last one
07-04-2020T01:01:22,SpazztasticKiwi,ig is starting to give me good stuff

07-04-2020T01:12:20,AspiringNoodle,So we're in agreement then? :3
07-04-2020T01:20:31,SpazztasticKiwi,now now
07-04-2020T01:20:41,SpazztasticKiwi,an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind
07-04-2020T01:20:54,SpazztasticKiwi,I say we be happy she was arrested and sent to jail
07-04-2020T01:21:22,SpazztasticKiwi,the fact we set the jail on fire is unimportant
07-04-2020T01:22:17,SpazztasticKiwi,"as a serious note, it‚Äôs become dangerous for some of Asian decent to go out in public now"
07-04-2020T01:23:00,AspiringNoodle,...oh no
07-04-2020T01:23:04,AspiringNoodle,Tom D:
07-04-2020T01:23:10,AspiringNoodle,"Oh wait, does he even leave home?"
07-04-2020T01:35:30,Dadrobit,"Yeah, it's fucking bullshit. Much thanks to that due to the semi-sentient dorito currently sitting in for a president."
07-04-2020T01:36:53,JojoF2415,:ptv-sleepy:
07-04-2020T01:37:06,SonOfGoku,Night Jojo
07-04-2020T01:40:05,SpazztasticKiwi,semi sentient dorito bruh
07-04-2020T01:40:40,SpazztasticKiwi,that‚Äôs got to be one of the best ones
07-04-2020T01:41:17,SpazztasticKiwi,now I‚Äôm not going to be able toes or eat doritos the same

07-04-2020T02:28:40,AspiringNoodle,Oh dang :O
07-04-2020T02:28:50,AspiringNoodle,"Guys, just watched a video called ""SCP: Dollhouse"""
07-04-2020T02:29:07,AspiringNoodle,Def recommend it.  Short little tactical horror film.
07-04-2020T02:30:00,AspiringNoodle,"Honestly, the SCP universe is PERFECT for the horror genre"
07-04-2020T02:30:31,AspiringNoodle,"It answers the question: ""What if you had special ops trained for very specific threats, but even that training is never enough?"""
07-04-2020T02:33:48,AspiringNoodle,Typical problem with any sort of military horror film
07-04-2020T02:34:09,AspiringNoodle,The threat is either so easily counterable that you wonder how it got so out of hand
07-04-2020T02:34:27,AspiringNoodle,Or it's so god damn effective you wonder how they even put up a defense? xD
07-04-2020T02:34:40,AspiringNoodle,"So one suffers from extreme incompetence, the other major plot armor"
07-04-2020T02:35:04,AspiringNoodle,"SCP finds that nice balance where you can overcome it, but the risk of casualties is super high~"
07-04-2020T02:49:39,AspiringNoodle,"mmmm, just dusted off my monitor, tablet, and PC case~"
07-04-2020T02:49:41,AspiringNoodle,"feels good, mang"

07-04-2020T11:09:42,CrimsonQuill,Because I remember that this one was the exact same as the vote according to the chat
07-04-2020T11:09:57,KeefMcDerpface,Willow
07-04-2020T11:10:01,CrimsonQuill,Ah

07-04-2020T11:10:14,CrimsonQuill,"Well, mine might make it this week"
07-04-2020T11:10:23,CrimsonQuill,It was in the top 10
07-04-2020T11:10:26,CrimsonQuill,I hope...
07-04-2020T11:19:18,JojoF2415,I was supposed to have a zoom meeting
07-04-2020T11:19:39,JojoF2415,but the teachers haven't said anything or taken action
07-04-2020T11:20:08,CrimsonQuill,Zoom meeting?
07-04-2020T11:20:52,JojoF2415,virtual talk
07-04-2020T11:20:57,CrimsonQuill,Oh
07-04-2020T11:21:07,CrimsonQuill,So are you a teacher?
07-04-2020T11:21:14,JojoF2415,no im a student
07-04-2020T11:21:18,CrimsonQuill,Oh I see
07-04-2020T11:21:20,CrimsonQuill,Aheh

07-04-2020T11:25:28,CrimsonQuill,Ah
07-04-2020T11:25:30,CrimsonQuill,Well
07-04-2020T11:25:39,CrimsonQuill,I'm almost tearingm my hair out
07-04-2020T11:25:53,CrimsonQuill,Because Air Assault armour is SO HARD TO DRAW
07-04-2020T11:25:59,CrimsonQuill,Recruit Armour? Not so bad
07-04-2020T11:26:04,CrimsonQuill,Mark VI? I can do it
07-04-2020T11:26:27,CrimsonQuill,But Air Assault...especially using the Female Spartan Techsuit...God it's hard
07-04-2020T11:29:06,JojoF2415,Im going to make my 3rd TK fan art
07-04-2020T11:29:18,JojoF2415,This time it‚Äôs trace and flora
07-04-2020T11:29:28,JojoF2415,It‚Äôs not going to be romantic
07-04-2020T11:38:40,CrimsonQuill,Aheh
07-04-2020T11:38:58,CrimsonQuill,I'm still trying to ink in the Spartan portrait
07-04-2020T11:39:05,CrimsonQuill,It's hard
07-04-2020T11:40:07,JojoF2415,What type of pen do u use
07-04-2020T11:41:07,CrimsonQuill,Several
07-04-2020T11:41:16,CrimsonQuill,Uni-pen fine liners
07-04-2020T11:41:20,CrimsonQuill,Water based nk
07-04-2020T11:41:33,CrimsonQuill,"I use a 0.05, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5 and 0.8"
07-04-2020T11:50:27,JojoF2415,That‚Äôs good
07-04-2020T12:04:07,CrimsonQuill,At long last...
07-04-2020T12:04:19,CrimsonQuill,I've inked her in. She's ready for some colour.
07-04-2020T12:04:26,CrimsonQuill,I'll do that later
07-04-2020T12:08:04,JojoF2415,Nice
07-04-2020T12:08:26,CrimsonQuill,...Still wondering whether Floofy Raine should be a thing in Haloi
07-04-2020T12:08:28,CrimsonQuill,Halo
07-04-2020T12:08:29,CrimsonQuill,I mean
07-04-2020T12:08:55,CrimsonQuill,Tom sketched her both ways (Admittedly he started the wolf one before checking my suggestion)
07-04-2020T12:09:07,CrimsonQuill,But could i justify it in any way in a Halo setting?
07-04-2020T12:09:20,CrimsonQuill,Other than Extradimensional portal stuff...
07-04-2020T12:10:49,CrimsonQuill,But I kinda wanna see Wolf Raine taking on a Brute Chieftain...
07-04-2020T12:10:52,CrimsonQuill,It'd look cool
07-04-2020T12:11:25,CrimsonQuill,"And add a cool ""Shady intelligence agency wants to abduct person for nefarious purposes"" subplot with ONI"
07-04-2020T12:11:36,CrimsonQuill,Maybe I should sort out the story before I go any further
07-04-2020T12:20:07,ThoseButterflys,sounds like you could almost go on to make it a comic or book
07-04-2020T12:22:30,CrimsonQuill,Well
07-04-2020T12:22:34,CrimsonQuill,That's kind of the ides
07-04-2020T12:22:36,CrimsonQuill,idea
07-04-2020T12:22:53,CrimsonQuill,I started these drawings BECAUSE I want to make a comic out of it
07-04-2020T12:23:52,CrimsonQuill,"With two of My OCs as the Leader and Lancer respectively, Raine and Red as Sniper and AIs, and other Halo OCs from around the community making cameos, or being supporting cast"

07-04-2020T12:47:44,JojoF2415,I really want to make a comic but I got to develop a story
07-04-2020T12:47:58,JojoF2415,At the same time I don‚Äôt want to make it
07-04-2020T12:54:32,CrimsonQuill,What would it be about Jojo?
07-04-2020T12:55:15,JojoF2415,A guy who can create a dimension
07-04-2020T12:55:37,JojoF2415,But is later confronted by his own creation
07-04-2020T13:02:42,CrimsonQuill,Ooooohhh
07-04-2020T13:02:45,CrimsonQuill,I like ity
07-04-2020T13:02:46,CrimsonQuill,it
07-04-2020T13:03:05,CrimsonQuill,So many possibilities bursting in from there
07-04-2020T13:03:08,CrimsonQuill,:)
07-04-2020T13:04:05,JojoF2415,But the main character is a half human half snow leopard boy

07-04-2020T14:18:44,CrimsonQuill,Spartan-IV Corporal Raine Silverlock is coloured and suited up
07-04-2020T14:18:55,CrimsonQuill,I'll probably upload it to Deviantart tomorrow
07-04-2020T14:19:04,CrimsonQuill,Then draw a group portrait again

07-04-2020T14:40:29,CrimsonQuill,PAIN/.
07-04-2020T14:40:33,CrimsonQuill,INCARNATE.
07-04-2020T14:40:51,CrimsonQuill,Seriously
07-04-2020T14:41:10,CrimsonQuill,I can never understand what Tex has against Grif in particular
07-04-2020T14:41:23,CrimsonQuill,Because she Always seems to go for his nadgers in RvB
07-04-2020T14:42:25,CrimsonQuill,"Not that Grif's a saint, but I have to say I pity him when he's hit for the seventh time...this time by Tex moving a concrete barricade so that when he lands from his 100 foot fall, well...you do the maths."
07-04-2020T14:44:11,JojoF2415,im going to do some work now

07-04-2020T20:33:51,JojoF2415,1 attempting a level in practice mode before beating the actual level
07-04-2020T20:34:04,JojoF2415,In normal mode
07-04-2020T21:54:24,SpazztasticKiwi,watching Mark and Ethan debate which state belonged to Oklahoma City

07-04-2020T22:43:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I know there‚Äôs been a few blow up t rex costumes and even someone who dressed in a bubble unicorn suit but a dragon head?
07-04-2020T22:44:40,SpazztasticKiwi,what in the dungeons and dragons dress up is going on
07-04-2020T22:44:55,Ordithus,all dragon no dungeon
07-04-2020T22:45:40,SpazztasticKiwi,and here we have the Quarantine Warp https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/524825976597643265/697652138654040115/image0.jpg
07-04-2020T22:46:54,Ordithus,why are we doing the splits
07-04-2020T22:52:06,AspiringNoodle,I think I'm giving notice on friday
07-04-2020T22:52:33,SpazztasticKiwi,do you not know how the time warp goes
07-04-2020T22:52:56,SpazztasticKiwi,"you jump to the left, and then ~step~ to the right"
07-04-2020T22:53:05,Ordithus,It's been a few years
07-04-2020T22:53:22,SpazztasticKiwi,"right foot first, but you‚Äôre not leaving your left foot behind"
07-04-2020T22:53:45,Ordithus,"really, Noodle?  That bad?"
07-04-2020T22:54:09,SpazztasticKiwi,"unless you want to do the splits.....possible with this quarantine warp, but the time warp had the pelvic thrust next"
07-04-2020T22:54:16,SpazztasticKiwi,hard to do in a split
07-04-2020T22:54:35,AspiringNoodle,I spent the first 2.5 hours of my shift just cleaning
07-04-2020T22:54:48,AspiringNoodle,Nothing but cleaning (maybe a lil register duty). But mostly cleaning
07-04-2020T22:55:34,AspiringNoodle,"Our one competitor is down for the next 2 weeks while they're disinfected, so our store is getting more traffic"
07-04-2020T22:55:43,AspiringNoodle,And what do I walk into?  Apparently no fucking CLEANING
07-04-2020T22:56:15,AspiringNoodle,The entire coffee bar was a fucking disaster area.  Coffee grounds everywhere
07-04-2020T22:56:37,CrRAR,:ccrrar-beakr: < health inspector face
07-04-2020T22:56:53,AspiringNoodle,"Dried coffee stains.  Dried creamer puddles, caked on sugar.  A giant fucking coffee spill that got everywhere.  The drip catchers for the creamers looked like they hadn't been cleaned since the last day I was there"
07-04-2020T22:57:31,AspiringNoodle,"Most of that 2.5 hours was spent cleaning up that disgrace.  I am now putting all immediate family on notice, DON'T SHOP WHERE I WORK"
07-04-2020T22:57:53,AspiringNoodle,"I don't trust that my coworkers are actually sanitizing the store properly, if at all, and I personally wouldn't buy a damn thing from there anymore until this whole thing is over."
07-04-2020T22:59:00,AspiringNoodle,"So the question becomes, if I wouldn't buy something from where I work, then why, in the name of all that is good an holy, would I still want to work there?"
07-04-2020T22:59:59,AspiringNoodle,"On top of that, I'm just WAITING for a write up, or a ""talk"" with my manager because nothings getting ""done"" on my shift"
07-04-2020T23:00:24,AspiringNoodle,#EndRant
07-04-2020T23:00:39,AspiringNoodle,"Do you regret asking, Ord? xD"
07-04-2020T23:00:50,Ordithus,You had a bit to get off your chest
07-04-2020T23:01:01,Ordithus,That level of stress is no good
07-04-2020T23:01:29,Ordithus,"sucks, leaving a job now.  But you can't do everything and get punished for it"
07-04-2020T23:01:33,AspiringNoodle,"I can guarantee my parents will just tell me some variation of ""suck it up"""
07-04-2020T23:02:23,AspiringNoodle,But I am seriously waiting for some kind of reprimand
07-04-2020T23:02:45,AspiringNoodle,"For the past few weeks, there have been multiple items on the checksheet that I haven't been finishing because there's so much to do"
07-04-2020T23:03:11,Ordithus,And you have spoken with your supervisor or whatever?
07-04-2020T23:03:29,AspiringNoodle,That's just the thing.  My manager left the store an hour before I got there today
07-04-2020T23:03:54,AspiringNoodle,"That mess would have to have been mostly there when he was in the building, which says he isn't even checking to make sure stuff is clean."
07-04-2020T23:04:58,AspiringNoodle,Fun fact about my store
07-04-2020T23:05:08,AspiringNoodle,Managers are basically never available on 2nd shift
07-04-2020T23:05:26,AspiringNoodle,"They are out of the building by 2, 3 at the latest"
07-04-2020T23:05:31,AspiringNoodle,2nd shift comes in from 2 - 3
07-04-2020T23:10:15,AspiringNoodle,*sigh*
