16-05-2020T00:04:00,AspiringNoodle,"It's a japanese style vending machine that will dispense random snack items dependant on the amount of currency entered, as well as the kind of currency"
16-05-2020T00:04:29,AspiringNoodle,"That said, what it dispenses can be HIGHLY dangerous, as it seems to be pulling ""snacks"" more suitable for other environments or even planets."

16-05-2020T00:06:19,AspiringNoodle,Reported to be delicious but a little too sweet.
16-05-2020T00:07:14,AspiringNoodle,Notes - More than half of the male staff avoided contact with the thing like it was made out of explosives. It is funny that the majority of staff here would prefer to have a picnic with SCP-682 over touching a[n effing] [you know what]-shaped candy.

16-05-2020T00:13:22,SpazztasticKiwi,men will draw them on any possible surface and they’re never out of references for them yet you show them one that’s not theirs meant to be held and they run screaming for the hills
16-05-2020T00:13:49,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s like throwing a fresh tampon in a male locker room

16-05-2020T15:45:55,CrimsonQuill,Seriously though
16-05-2020T15:46:05,Roughlandin,Do they still make those?
16-05-2020T15:46:16,CrimsonQuill,If I don't get out of bed immeditely on waking up and then shower and dress I feel terrible
16-05-2020T15:46:25,CrimsonQuill,It feels uncomfortable and wrong
16-05-2020T15:47:35,ShamusTheFox,*waves*
16-05-2020T15:47:38,ThingsAreMoving,\o
16-05-2020T15:47:39,Ordithus,o/
16-05-2020T15:47:45,Roughlandin,"I've gotten back into the habit of showering regularly again, lol. For a while back in April I was on like a day-on, day-off thing"
16-05-2020T15:48:02,Roughlandin,"But yeah, after a while I started feeling... yucky"
16-05-2020T15:48:10,Roughlandin,No one likes a yucky bear
16-05-2020T15:48:10,CrimsonQuill,I work in a nursing home.
16-05-2020T15:48:15,Ordithus,that can actually be better for your skin/hair
16-05-2020T15:48:17,CrimsonQuill,Showers are not optional.
16-05-2020T15:48:25,Roughlandin,Yeah shower daily. More than daily
16-05-2020T15:48:27,ShamusTheFox,I don't feel right if I don't get a shower
16-05-2020T15:48:32,CrimsonQuill,Twice on work days
16-05-2020T15:48:33,ThingsAreMoving,I shower before going to bed. Can't imagine falling asleep with all day's worth of sweat still on me
16-05-2020T15:49:36,Roughlandin,"I used to take a serious scrubdown shower every day after coming home from the pharmacy. Folk is nasty, yo."
16-05-2020T15:49:54,RimaDraws,yea being icky ew
16-05-2020T15:49:56,ThingsAreMoving,understandable
16-05-2020T15:50:30,ShamusTheFox,"Oh, Rima! Saw your young/old Rose pic, nice work on that."
16-05-2020T15:50:34,Roughlandin,"Like, run their hands all over the counter after explaining the doctor thinks they might have MRSA, nasty"
16-05-2020T15:50:40,RimaDraws,thank you
16-05-2020T15:50:48,CrimsonQuill,Haven't seen that...maybe I should look
16-05-2020T15:51:05,CrimsonQuill,"Tomorrow though, cos tonight is STREM"
16-05-2020T15:51:29,CrimsonQuill,"Oh yeah, my friend wants to sell their old WACOM Cintiq 13'' to me"
16-05-2020T15:51:31,RimaDraws,it's on deviantart
16-05-2020T15:51:50,CrimsonQuill,So I might try Digital drawing if and when i get it
16-05-2020T15:51:57,Roughlandin,Noice
16-05-2020T15:52:02,CrimsonQuill,It'd surely make it easier to make my Fancomic
16-05-2020T15:52:17,CrimsonQuill,But I also want to keep doing colour pencil too
16-05-2020T15:52:28,CrimsonQuill,Because that is an art form all on its own
16-05-2020T15:52:34,Roughlandin,Tis that
16-05-2020T15:52:47,CrimsonQuill,I'm not getting photoshop though. My friend says that if I get the tablet I should use Krita
16-05-2020T15:53:01,CrimsonQuill,Which is free and has almost everything Photoshop does
16-05-2020T15:53:19,Roughlandin,Free is always better
16-05-2020T15:53:42,ShamusTheFox,Not always. I wouldn't want free brain surgery.
16-05-2020T15:54:04,ThingsAreMoving,"I would, if it meant I'd get some superpowers"
16-05-2020T15:54:25,Roughlandin,Long as they don't give you a brain from Abby Normal
16-05-2020T15:54:33,CrimsonQuill,X
16-05-2020T15:54:46,ShamusTheFox,"I love that guy, he's not like everyone else."

16-05-2020T18:55:26,Ordithus,and science!
16-05-2020T18:55:31,vevans0009,^
16-05-2020T18:55:43,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-laura::guitar:
16-05-2020T18:55:52,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,I should play New Vegas again
16-05-2020T18:56:06,vevans0009,Tempt back to Fallout 4
16-05-2020T18:56:15,vevans0009,STill have the saves
16-05-2020T18:56:20,Ordithus,haven't played 4 yet
16-05-2020T18:56:23,Roughlandin,Half of my carry weight was always taken up by carrying around every weapon type I could use. You know... Just in case
16-05-2020T18:56:26,Ordithus,loved the hell outta 3 and NV
16-05-2020T18:56:31,Roughlandin,NV is best
16-05-2020T18:56:42,Roughlandin,Outer Worlds is awesome if you loved NV
16-05-2020T18:57:00,vevans0009,Tried Outer Worlds.  Felt limited....
16-05-2020T18:57:03,Ordithus,will def have to give that one a try
16-05-2020T18:57:20,Roughlandin,It's basically fallout in the Buck Rodgers universe
16-05-2020T18:57:32,Roughlandin,But it is... kinda short
16-05-2020T18:57:36,Roughlandin,Good but short
16-05-2020T18:57:41,vevans0009,Couldn't do much like in 4
16-05-2020T18:57:45,Ordithus,define short
16-05-2020T18:57:52,Roughlandin,Maybe 20 hours
16-05-2020T18:58:06,Ordithus,seems a good length
16-05-2020T18:58:10,Roughlandin,"Not super short, but not NV length"
16-05-2020T18:58:11,KeefMcDerpface,Does that include exploring?
16-05-2020T18:58:11,ThingsAreMoving,you can finish the main storyline a lot faster than that
16-05-2020T18:58:19,vevans0009,Not much exploring
16-05-2020T18:58:26,ThingsAreMoving,But like most open world games it's pretty rewarding if you explore
16-05-2020T18:58:40,Roughlandin,It feels more like Bioshock than Fallout in terms of exploration though
16-05-2020T18:58:48,vevans0009,Yep
16-05-2020T18:58:49,Roughlandin,Kind of a series of smaller sandboxes
16-05-2020T18:58:52,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,who would be one of the ghost people?
16-05-2020T18:59:04,ThingsAreMoving,My biggest dissapointment was the dialogue system tbh
16-05-2020T18:59:08,vevans0009,"""ghost people"" ?"
16-05-2020T18:59:14,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,what TK character that is
16-05-2020T18:59:21,ThingsAreMoving,ghoul?
16-05-2020T18:59:23,vevans0009,"Ghouls"""
16-05-2020T18:59:26,Roughlandin,The ghost people from the NV DLC?

16-05-2020T18:59:34,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,yes Rough

16-05-2020T18:59:54,vevans0009,Welp okay then.  Never play NV.  WTH do I know

16-05-2020T18:59:58,KeefMcDerpface,Keith's parents?
16-05-2020T19:00:02,vevans0009,x3
16-05-2020T19:00:08,Roughlandin,They're from the Dead Money DLC
16-05-2020T19:00:50,KeefMcDerpface,"Oh gosh, now I'm remembering the jamming for guns."
16-05-2020T19:01:27,vevans0009,Glad 4 did not have that.
16-05-2020T19:01:49,vevans0009,Jamming guns.  TOO realistic.
16-05-2020T19:02:11,vevans0009,Wanna leave reality
16-05-2020T19:02:12,vevans0009,x3
16-05-2020T19:02:14,Roughlandin,New Vegas had the best story. 4 had the settlement building stuff. Still think New Vegas was my favorite though. Shame the PC port sucks
16-05-2020T19:02:43,vevans0009,Perhaps.
16-05-2020T19:03:08,ThingsAreMoving,"Fallout 2 was my fav. If I were to consider only the 3D ones though NV takes the first place, easily."
16-05-2020T19:03:13,vevans0009,Always side with the Brotherhood.
16-05-2020T19:03:29,vevans0009,Screw them synths. x3
16-05-2020T19:03:33,vevans0009,Freaky

16-05-2020T19:03:52,vevans0009,Did the most mission just for xp
16-05-2020T19:04:00,Roughlandin,I cannot tell you how many times I've played FO4 and I still have never finished the main storyline lol
16-05-2020T19:04:12,vevans0009,No rush
16-05-2020T19:04:19,Roughlandin,Same with Witcher 3
16-05-2020T19:04:20,KeefMcDerpface,What about DLC?
16-05-2020T19:04:22,vevans0009,Just have fun getting stuff
16-05-2020T19:04:39,Roughlandin,Beat the Nuka World DLC

16-05-2020T19:05:29,Roughlandin,Yeah beat that one too. It was pretty short but the robot creation part was neat
16-05-2020T19:05:38,CrimsonQuill,Looking good so far Tom!

16-05-2020T20:55:56,CrRAR,haha
16-05-2020T20:55:56,vevans0009,x3
16-05-2020T20:56:15,IronHorseComics,@Ordithus so Carver is really just a puppet?
16-05-2020T20:56:22,KeefMcDerpface,So his illusion was him trying to be a real boy?
16-05-2020T20:56:27,Ordithus,haha
16-05-2020T20:56:31,Roughlandin,Carver is a bad boy. But the WB sisters will make him a bad man

16-05-2020T21:10:53,Roughlandin,Great mouse detective was WAAAAY before the 90s
16-05-2020T21:11:03,ShamusTheFox,"You didn't really see anything, but boy did Miss Kitty give ideas."
16-05-2020T21:11:07,IronHorseComics,not way before the 90's
16-05-2020T21:11:09,Roughlandin,Oh 86
16-05-2020T21:11:12,Roughlandin,Huh
16-05-2020T21:11:30,Roughlandin,I thought it was like around the same time as Robin Hood for some reason
16-05-2020T21:11:31,IronHorseComics,funny enough that was the first animated film to use CGI in the background
16-05-2020T21:11:46,ProsePro7,1984 was the Detective I think
16-05-2020T21:11:55,IronHorseComics,"ohhh, yes, who could forget Maid Maram"
16-05-2020T21:11:56,vevans0009,Google people
16-05-2020T21:12:00,NezumiYuki,Yep CGI used properly!   As background elements to help the story along.
16-05-2020T21:12:00,vevans0009,Or bing
16-05-2020T21:12:23,Roughlandin,Really? When I think about that movie I remember a lot of water colored backgrounds for some reason
16-05-2020T21:12:31,ShamusTheFox,Maid Marian was my first furry crush.
16-05-2020T21:12:34,ProsePro7,Which one?
16-05-2020T21:12:44,Roughlandin,Mouse Detective
16-05-2020T21:12:48,Roughlandin,Also Robin Hood
16-05-2020T21:12:56,NezumiYuki,The biggest use of CIG in Mouse Detective was inside of West Minster Clock Tower and Big Ben.
16-05-2020T21:13:05,ProsePro7,The quality of art is very different
16-05-2020T21:13:12,RimaDraws,ooh
16-05-2020T21:13:21,RimaDraws,<3
16-05-2020T21:13:24,ProsePro7,Robin Hood was when they were still doing the retracing thing
16-05-2020T21:13:29,Roughlandin,And yes. Maid Marian was the original furry waifu. Just as Robin Hood was the first furry husbando.
16-05-2020T21:13:50,vevans0009,Baffled how people don't see Disney films furry when they had furries in them
16-05-2020T21:13:58,KeefMcDerpface,yeah

16-05-2020T21:17:21,NezumiYuki,Not trying to jinx anything... but honestly... Zootopia might be the very last good thing to have come out of Disney as of late... and that' s a shame.... =(
16-05-2020T21:17:25,Roughlandin,Judy is some prime furry waifu. As is Gazelle

16-05-2020T21:18:00,Roughlandin,Fun Fact: Shakira specifically requested in her contract that her zootopia character had to have booty
16-05-2020T21:18:04,NezumiYuki,"Oh dont' get me wrong, Moana was heckin awesome!"

16-05-2020T21:24:19,Ordithus,"don't forget the <3 pattern, prose"
16-05-2020T21:24:19,KeefMcDerpface,Someone's been paying attention to something other than his eyes.
16-05-2020T21:24:25,ShamusTheFox,Knock knock! Who's there? BWOM!
16-05-2020T21:24:31,NezumiYuki,runs off to TwoKinds page to double check

16-05-2020T21:25:13,PalmettoPathfinder1,I do know that Mike was mad that Nora had messed with his fur pattern when he was turned into a girl.
16-05-2020T21:25:22,KeefMcDerpface,"I think that was the mistletoe affect, Rough."
16-05-2020T21:25:47,NezumiYuki,Aww commmon Mikey... What's wrong with a little Heart Spot on yer back?   :3
16-05-2020T21:25:49,Roughlandin,Yeah. I think the basic gist is his eyes go blue when he's getting messed with magically
16-05-2020T21:25:58,ProsePro7,Escaflowne...an anime I just did not get...at least it gave us a cute cat girl
16-05-2020T21:26:30,Roughlandin,Hmmm... Why don't Clovis' eyes change color while he's shifted...?
16-05-2020T21:26:35,vevans0009,LIke that vid. x3

16-05-2020T21:27:23,K3IDRAN,I wouldn't mind. Being transformed Into a girl as long If It's not. Permanent
16-05-2020T21:27:27,vevans0009,Full anthro girls in an anime is hard to come by.
16-05-2020T21:27:27,ProsePro7,Probably because the thing is broken half the time but whatever
16-05-2020T21:27:56,ProsePro7,Aisha Clan Clan still wins as best girl in anime
16-05-2020T21:28:00,vevans0009,Well was..
16-05-2020T21:28:03,IronHorseComics,there's Gate if you can handle a bit of JSDF ego inflating
16-05-2020T21:28:08,vevans0009,BNA and Beastars
16-05-2020T21:28:12,IronHorseComics,it has fully anthro characters
16-05-2020T21:28:16,Zakuru,":eyes: ""illusion"" huh~"

16-05-2020T21:28:21,NezumiYuki,"Hmmm as of lately, the only part anthro girls in anime I've seen was maybe, Raphtalia from Shield Hero"
16-05-2020T21:28:30,vevans0009,WHat?
16-05-2020T21:28:31,IronHorseComics,Japanese Self Defense Force

16-05-2020T21:28:49,vevans0009,Let me doublecheck
16-05-2020T21:29:01,ProsePro7,Saw the start of it in a Manga need to finish it
16-05-2020T21:29:04,Roughlandin,There's that hyena girl in Interspecies Reviewers... But that's PRETTTTY nsfw...
16-05-2020T21:29:23,ProsePro7,The cat girls in that are very nice
16-05-2020T21:29:34,unsteddyphoenix,weird that the illusion made him shorter
16-05-2020T21:29:44,PalmettoPathfinder1,I think the only thing that was different between Mike and FemMike's fur patterns was that he had a heart shaped pattern on his female's butt.
16-05-2020T21:29:46,unsteddyphoenix,I wonder how that works :thinking:
16-05-2020T21:29:50,Ordithus,didn't affect the reach of his punch tho
16-05-2020T21:29:52,Roughlandin,Words words words
16-05-2020T21:29:53,PalmettoPathfinder1,But I could be wrong.
16-05-2020T21:29:55,NezumiYuki,"Speaking as a NON cat girl, I can say that CatGirls are OVERRATED!"
16-05-2020T21:29:57,ProsePro7,I remember reading Negima that there was a full cat girl or two.  Beastmen
16-05-2020T21:30:07,NezumiYuki,Flora:  What was that... Rodent?!?!?!?!

16-05-2020T21:32:17,KeefMcDerpface,It should become his nickname if not.

16-05-2020T21:33:11,PalmettoPathfinder1,Now we get to see what male Mike's back pattern is!  We finally get to see how different it is from his female self!
16-05-2020T21:33:14,unsteddyphoenix,Seems like the type of name Eric might give honestly
16-05-2020T21:33:18,ProsePro7,His name is Michael right?
16-05-2020T21:33:28,Roughlandin,He'll never admit it... But we all know the REAL canon now

16-05-2020T21:33:33,IronHorseComics,"see, little known fact is that Mike's fur is actually two tone orange"

16-05-2020T22:54:13,KeefMcDerpface,true

16-05-2020T23:09:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"to be clear, this is a play at how blessed they are, nothing more"
16-05-2020T23:09:50,AspiringNoodle,"Big brain play: Maddie, by opening her own coffee shop, gets free coffee all day e'ry day ;D"
16-05-2020T23:10:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Mad Beans or Mad Roast
16-05-2020T23:10:55,Dadrobit,"That has a sad end. She'd end up like one of those MLM ""entrepreneurs"" who has boxes of merchandise that no one but themselves uses."
16-05-2020T23:10:57,SpazztasticKiwi,the Mad Grind
16-05-2020T23:11:09,Dadrobit,Step Brother was like that for a while.
16-05-2020T23:11:13,SpazztasticKiwi,this is Maddie we’re talking about
16-05-2020T23:11:20,SpazztasticKiwi,she can sell water to fish
16-05-2020T23:11:27,AspiringNoodle,Also Landen
16-05-2020T23:11:30,KeefMcDerpface,^
16-05-2020T23:11:48,KeefMcDerpface,And anyone in Mekkan that's like Landen.
16-05-2020T23:12:03,AspiringNoodle,"One of these days the gov just needs to call out MLM's for what they are, god damned Ponzi Schemes"
16-05-2020T23:13:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I could see Adria selling it at the tavern
16-05-2020T23:13:17,Dadrobit,Brother was with Amway. Stopped after he essentially ran out of money.
16-05-2020T23:13:21,SpazztasticKiwi,there’s bound to be someone drinking coffee over beer
16-05-2020T23:13:37,Dadrobit,"But he wants to get back in and ""really give it (his) all this time!"""
16-05-2020T23:13:48,AspiringNoodle,"Imagine that, coffee becoming the first franchise"
16-05-2020T23:13:55,AspiringNoodle,*sigh*
16-05-2020T23:13:59,Dadrobit,Coffee over beer? Literally every time I would take that trade.
16-05-2020T23:14:18,AspiringNoodle,It's that kind of thinking that allows MLM's (*cough cough* PYRAMID SCHEMES *cough cough*) to persist
16-05-2020T23:14:23,SpazztasticKiwi,exactly - and why wouldn’t she sell her daughter in laws coffee
16-05-2020T23:14:42,AspiringNoodle,"""There's a sucker born every minute"""
16-05-2020T23:15:06,Dadrobit,Incoming Questionable Content crossover episodes.
16-05-2020T23:15:39,AspiringNoodle,Here's the big question
16-05-2020T23:15:51,Ordithus,coffee>beer except after 4 pm
16-05-2020T23:16:00,AspiringNoodle,Let's say Maddie's coffee shop becomes the first franchise in Mekkan
16-05-2020T23:16:09,SpazztasticKiwi,yeah but what time zone
16-05-2020T23:16:13,SpazztasticKiwi,details are important
16-05-2020T23:16:17,AspiringNoodle,And one opened up near Adira and started stealing her customers.  How would Adira respond?
16-05-2020T23:16:17,Dadrobit,"Nah, I wake up a bit after 4pm. I'll absolutely take that."
16-05-2020T23:16:25,SpazztasticKiwi,the line between casual and alcoholic
16-05-2020T23:16:52,Dadrobit,"Also, I legit just do not like beer at all. Never had one I enjoyed."
16-05-2020T23:17:00,AspiringNoodle,"Also, would Maeve end up sneaking some coffee behind her mother's back? :ptv-laugh:"
16-05-2020T23:17:10,AspiringNoodle,"Dadro, I'm kinda in the same ballpark"
16-05-2020T23:17:14,Sclimshady,You cant claim alcoholic till your morning coffee has whisky
16-05-2020T23:17:14,steelabjur,"""Magi Bros. Manly Macchiato"""
16-05-2020T23:17:15,Ordithus,"enjoy both, sometimes at the same time"
16-05-2020T23:17:16,AspiringNoodle,I've had just about every other kind of alcohol
16-05-2020T23:17:34,Ordithus,coffee beers are tasty
16-05-2020T23:17:34,AspiringNoodle,"But to be fair, the only beer I've had was a port, probably not a good beginner drink, haha"
16-05-2020T23:17:37,SpazztasticKiwi,can’t be an alcoholic until you qualify as Irish?
16-05-2020T23:17:46,AspiringNoodle,Let's see...
16-05-2020T23:17:47,Sclimshady,Beer is not all that great
16-05-2020T23:17:49,AspiringNoodle,"pasty white skin, check"
16-05-2020T23:17:55,Ordithus,nooo porter is not a good starter
16-05-2020T23:18:04,AspiringNoodle,red hairs? check
16-05-2020T23:18:09,AspiringNoodle,freckles? bingo
16-05-2020T23:18:17,Sclimshady,"My god,  noodle has no soul"
16-05-2020T23:18:25,AspiringNoodle,"Never said I was ginger, lol"
16-05-2020T23:18:41,AspiringNoodle,My hair is mostly brown with strands of red for more depth of color ;)
16-05-2020T23:18:42,SpazztasticKiwi,I man I got freckles too but they’re not dark
16-05-2020T23:18:58,Dadrobit,Part of a soul. Next thing you know we'll find out Noodle was only ever presenting as a man.
16-05-2020T23:19:00,SpazztasticKiwi,you gotta be real close to see them and they’re all under my eyes
16-05-2020T23:19:20,SpazztasticKiwi,anyone that gets that close better have a permission slip
16-05-2020T23:19:24,AspiringNoodle,I have no idea what you mean *hiss hiss*
16-05-2020T23:22:46,Dadrobit,"I hate dreaming. Sleeping is supposed to be relaxing. But there you are, lying down, totally relaxed, and then suddenly, you have to build a gokart with your ex landlord!"
16-05-2020T23:25:15,steelabjur,"Eh, depends on the dream. Some I can do without, but I tend to come up with most of my ideas while I'm dreaming."
16-05-2020T23:25:46,Dadrobit,"""You may have seen this next comedian on the David Letterman Show"" is my favorite introduction. But I believe more people have seen me at the store. That's probably a more accurate introduction, ""You may have seen this next comedian at the store!"""
16-05-2020T23:29:41,Dadrobit,"My friend is a blackjack dealer, so he has a tattoo of an Ace and a Jack. But I'm a blackjack player, so I'm gonna get a tattoo of a ten, and a two. And maybe later a King."
16-05-2020T23:30:06,Ordithus,haha
16-05-2020T23:30:30,SpazztasticKiwi,well I’m lost
16-05-2020T23:30:34,AspiringNoodle,In what?
16-05-2020T23:30:51,KeefMcDerpface,A corn maze?
16-05-2020T23:31:01,Dadrobit,Mitch Hedberg. One of my favorite comedians of all time. Guy named Dufrane earlier reminded me to watch him again.
16-05-2020T23:31:03,AspiringNoodle,The sea of thirst from tonight's stream?
16-05-2020T23:31:39,Dadrobit,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUNvFVQYClY

16-05-2020T23:32:36,Dadrobit,"Have a good night, Ord!"
16-05-2020T23:34:41,SpazztasticKiwi,eh
16-05-2020T23:34:50,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m more for brad upton
16-05-2020T23:34:54,Dadrobit,"I was gonna get my teeth whitened, but then I said screw it, I'll just get a tan instead."
16-05-2020T23:35:12,SpazztasticKiwi,& Jeff allen

16-05-2020T23:44:21,Dadrobit,o/ Keef
16-05-2020T23:45:58,AspiringNoodle,"Dadro, you ever watch CinemaSins?"
16-05-2020T23:52:05,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I'll watch one every once in a while."
16-05-2020T23:57:04,AspiringNoodle,Did you see the one for Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs?
16-05-2020T23:57:51,Dadrobit,nope
16-05-2020T23:58:00,SpazztasticKiwi,the one for blade was good
16-05-2020T23:58:17,AspiringNoodle,Did you personally see that movie?
16-05-2020T23:58:52,SpazztasticKiwi,"the one for avengers pointed out that in the earlier marvel movies, they communicated across battle scenes while fighting with no mics or coms of any sort"
16-05-2020T23:58:58,SpazztasticKiwi,I own the blade trilogy
16-05-2020T23:58:59,Dadrobit,When it came out forever ago. I recall none of it.
16-05-2020T23:59:44,AspiringNoodle,"Well, the dude genuinely laughed at the scene where Sardine Land was being destroyed"
