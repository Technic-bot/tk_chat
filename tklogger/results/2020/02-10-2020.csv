02-10-2020T13:24:47,CrRAR,I just hope it takes him down a peg when it comes to how he approaches how he conducts himself. If anything around the covid situation.
02-10-2020T13:25:14,CrRAR,It's the least good thing that can come from this.

02-10-2020T13:39:15,Ordithus,Really wishing the one here had not happened
02-10-2020T13:39:53,Ordithus,I'm honestly surprised there's been so much campaigning in MN... polls have this state at like Biden +8
02-10-2020T13:49:52,CrRAR,"If he lost the faith of blue collar folk expecting the factory boom again I think he's in trouble, if he hasn't made them feel more secure."
02-10-2020T13:50:12,CrRAR,"Though you know, I feel like he's had to spend so much of his first term appeasing corporate america I d o wonder if he could do something for the average folk."
02-10-2020T13:51:31,CrRAR,Like I do feel like him getting cut off 4 years in if there's benefits to be had later could be a plan to actually stop any generousness to the populace.
02-10-2020T13:51:58,CrRAR,"....but that's a BIG leap of faith to take, judging by his character"
02-10-2020T13:52:44,CrRAR,The way I see it though is that you have to EARN a 2nd term... as like... an encore.

02-10-2020T13:55:39,CrRAR,"What I feel will happen is Biden gets in and he has his tax plan which is much more sustainable, but will not be the same business-empowering plan Trump's has been."
02-10-2020T13:56:20,CrRAR,Trump's plan literally has been to just douse the economic fire with gasoline.
