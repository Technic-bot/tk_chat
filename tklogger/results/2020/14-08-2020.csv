14-08-2020T00:00:02,Dadrobit,"Keef, if you're questioning unsteddy's anachronisms still, then you must not be the sharpest bulb in the shed."
14-08-2020T00:00:02,BadFoMo,"@SageSaga So it would be a loop of someone booping her nose, she gets surprised, then angry, then biting the finger off, the person's bloody hand goes off screen, Nyna spits out or swallows the finger and loop there?"
14-08-2020T00:00:03,ZRO4825,"Monster-girl, basically."
14-08-2020T00:00:25,hyneria,But more monster than human? I thought she was like the cat equivalent of a werewolf or a minotaur
14-08-2020T00:00:46,ZRO4825,She is. But monster creatures live by different rules. And for the most part she sees humans as prey.
14-08-2020T00:01:00,SageSaga,she'd probably just bite it hard and shake it a bit and sput it out so they can run
14-08-2020T00:01:12,SageSaga,spit*
14-08-2020T00:01:18,SageSaga,its hard typing over my tablet
14-08-2020T00:01:22,Ordithus,And then blast em?
14-08-2020T00:01:31,Ordithus,:csagesaga-nynasmirk:
14-08-2020T00:01:36,SageSaga,depends on who it was
14-08-2020T00:01:44,hyneria,"Who would win in a fight, Kate or Nyna? :P"
14-08-2020T00:01:49,SageSaga,Nyna
14-08-2020T00:01:57,hyneria,Really?
14-08-2020T00:01:59,SageSaga,Nyna is way stronger
14-08-2020T00:02:01,unsteddyphoenix,"Oh so that part it depends, but no matter who it was shed bite their finger off"
14-08-2020T00:02:13,hyneria,I thought Kate was pretty strong too
14-08-2020T00:02:17,ZRO4825,Kate's not really any stronger than a normal human if I remember Yosh lore correctly.
14-08-2020T00:02:20,SageSaga,stronger faster and more adept at combat
14-08-2020T00:02:36,SageSaga,shes a little more agile than an average human and has better senses
14-08-2020T00:02:47,hyneria,oh
14-08-2020T00:02:51,SageSaga,but Nyna has all that multiplied by a hundred
14-08-2020T00:03:04,NezumiYuki,Back again for a bit and Lo and behold....  Ninja NIbbly hiding up by the pillar with Maddie!
14-08-2020T00:03:11,KeefMcDerpface,wb
14-08-2020T00:03:31,KeefMcDerpface,"Nibbly: ""What are we watching Maddie?"""
14-08-2020T00:03:37,BadFoMo,Derpy Nibbly?
14-08-2020T00:03:50,hyneria,I see
14-08-2020T00:04:00,SageSaga,Hyneria- unless you meant Kaylin?
14-08-2020T00:04:12,hyneria,I like Nyna. She breaks away from the catgirl stereotype
14-08-2020T00:04:44,hyneria,I think Kaylin is stronger than Nyna?
14-08-2020T00:04:45,BadFoMo,I still like Nyna's line about the Tank.
14-08-2020T00:04:52,KeefMcDerpface,"haha, yeah"
14-08-2020T00:04:54,SageSaga,Kaylin is stronger than Nyna
14-08-2020T00:05:37,Ordithus,She spent their whole introduction fight commenting how cute Nyna is
14-08-2020T00:06:16,SageSaga,i just wasnt sure if you were mixing up Kate with Kaylin- seeing as they both have purple hair and both start their name with a K? ive seen stranger things
14-08-2020T00:06:25,BadFoMo,"...Also her line about adventurers. ""Adventurers are /way/ too over powered.""."
14-08-2020T00:06:33,hyneria,"Well Kaylin is technically a ""player"". So she has the potential to become stronger than anyone in that world, I'd think"
14-08-2020T00:06:42,hyneria,or at least that is a common isekai rule
14-08-2020T00:06:45,SageSaga,someone called Lia Blue because she has Blue hair- but she is not Blue...
14-08-2020T00:06:45,Dadrobit,Still have yet to see Stranger Things myself actually.
14-08-2020T00:07:09,SageSaga,i thought about making that joke too Robit
14-08-2020T00:07:12,RimaDraws,i cant wait for season 4
14-08-2020T00:07:18,Ordithus,Solution to that is more Lia
14-08-2020T00:07:38,Dadrobit,Great minds
14-08-2020T00:07:39,hyneria,Funnily so I thought Nyna was a phase cat rather than a nekomata. When I began reading
14-08-2020T00:08:41,BadFoMo,I haven't seen Stranger Things eather. I've seen Strangerhood if that counts.
14-08-2020T00:09:26,PostApocalypticDrifter,night peeps
14-08-2020T00:09:28,Ordithus,I am the sleepy. Good night and thanks for the streams! :ctwokinds-RainezZz:
14-08-2020T00:09:33,BadFoMo,Good night.
14-08-2020T00:09:33,hyneria,but I guess a nekomata is a higher level monster than a phase cat?

14-08-2020T00:20:02,SageSaga,if you need to be up at 8 i guess its a good time to sleep?
14-08-2020T00:20:18,unsteddyphoenix,Barely worth sleeping if you gotta wake up that earl
14-08-2020T00:20:39,Combak,I got up at 3 AM.
14-08-2020T00:20:57,Dadrobit,Literally never worked a job since high school that made me wake up before noon.

14-08-2020T00:54:18,FenceEqualizer,Had a bit too much with edible cookies. Am a big guy so roomies offered me more then one because the last one had little affect on me

14-08-2020T00:58:31,SageSaga,its not a big deal- anyone can get something on amazon
14-08-2020T00:58:49,FenceEqualizer,True but not everyone takes the time for it
14-08-2020T00:58:57,SageSaga,i just need to make sure the PDF isnt too big to send to Comixology
14-08-2020T00:59:03,FenceEqualizer,Still kinda cool
14-08-2020T00:59:45,SageSaga,I wanna put book one on there- maybe get it in the Kindle free library and that way people can read it and i get a cut if they do from their subscriptions
14-08-2020T01:00:15,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I get work through ACX. Some of the stuff is.... Not great. Plenty of good work to be found as well though."
14-08-2020T01:00:49,SageSaga,the big part is- its a market i havent touched- its practically free advertising if i do it right
14-08-2020T01:01:13,SageSaga,and during the Pandemic is a good time to jump on an Ebook <_<

14-08-2020T01:08:16,BadFoMo,No. Why?
14-08-2020T01:08:27,SageSaga,its a tip for talking to people who normally read lips

14-08-2020T01:12:50,BadFoMo,I remember my'friend' telling me about a similer thing he had to do when he was working at WalMart. That was like the only way the one Veitnames guy could talk with others. ...It worked half of the time.
14-08-2020T01:14:02,NezumiYuki,Don't some of these people who are speaking to their phones proof read what was dictated before showing it to the deaf person?   xD   gods
14-08-2020T01:14:31,Dadrobit,I always prof read everything I show others.
14-08-2020T01:14:39,Dadrobit,Proof*
14-08-2020T01:14:42,SageSaga,ya dont need to- most of it will be close enough that they can tell
14-08-2020T01:14:49,NezumiYuki,Hell I know it takes a bit longer but I'd rather just type out with the keyboard and have the person read that... much less errors!
14-08-2020T01:15:54,Twokinds,I have to go to the dmv Monday.
14-08-2020T01:16:02,Twokinds,So I'll be wearing a mask for the second time.
14-08-2020T01:16:10,Dadrobit,Lmao
14-08-2020T01:16:25,SageSaga,think about it this way though- the deaf person could pull out their phone to listen to someone they cant lip read though

14-08-2020T01:48:56,AspiringNoodle,Will it ever be unbroken? :ptv-whiny:

14-08-2020T01:56:10,IraNovaki,It was also obvious that I was suffering a hallucination inducing headache
14-08-2020T01:56:55,IraNovaki,It was something that after I went to the doctor's the next day that they were stumped and beyond confused since it was something totally new and unexpected

14-08-2020T01:58:50,FenceEqualizer,Don't want to over step and will just say hope you get away from that soon.  Also most of what unsteddy said.
14-08-2020T01:58:59,IraNovaki,"Waiting for school, and I've had to be my own therapist"
14-08-2020T01:59:23,IraNovaki,Not. Easy

14-08-2020T02:04:14,IraNovaki,"Sexist, racist, stereotypical hypocrite who thinks he's better then everyone and smarter. I am forced to learn from his mistakes. The moment I prove him wrong or come up with a better idea, he comes down on me hard. He scarred both my brother's"

14-08-2020T02:10:15,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah I am not putting together how she got up there
14-08-2020T02:10:42,BadFoMo,She Maddie-ed up there.
14-08-2020T02:10:43,unsteddyphoenix,or how she goes from Up there to underwater
14-08-2020T02:10:54,unsteddyphoenix,Such stealth?
14-08-2020T02:10:57,NezumiYuki,Panel 4 of the 2nd page can sooooooooo be taken out of context.  <3
14-08-2020T02:10:59,IraNovaki,Maybe she's part squirrel?
14-08-2020T02:11:27,unsteddyphoenix,It is pretty funny to think of it like that with death doom pain destruction in the background
14-08-2020T02:11:34,BadFoMo,! She /is/ a Were-Squirrel!
14-08-2020T02:11:45,Dadrobit,"You were merely adopted by the stealth, she was born into it, molded by it..."
14-08-2020T02:12:12,FenceEqualizer,Need more stealth montages.
14-08-2020T02:12:15,Dadrobit,She was already a man by the time she tried casual interaction!
14-08-2020T02:12:16,AspiringNoodle,My butt is still tense
14-08-2020T02:12:20,IraNovaki,My cat's joining us for the stream
14-08-2020T02:12:22,unsteddyphoenix,So just blank pages montage?
14-08-2020T02:12:22,AspiringNoodle,I'm just waiting for the random Tom scream
14-08-2020T02:12:35,NezumiYuki,"Sam Phisher and Solid Snake approve of more ""Stealth"""
14-08-2020T02:12:43,AspiringNoodle,"No idea if he'll do it, but it's the uncertainty that's doing me"
14-08-2020T02:12:51,IraNovaki,Oof
14-08-2020T02:13:08,FenceEqualizer,I was thinking more like background scenes
14-08-2020T02:13:26,FenceEqualizer,Got to have the audience guessing if Maddie is actually their or not.
14-08-2020T02:13:30,IraNovaki,Wait... Where'd she get the snorkel?!
14-08-2020T02:13:31,FenceEqualizer,*there
14-08-2020T02:13:48,AspiringNoodle,Waitaminut... that's a good question....
14-08-2020T02:14:13,Twokinds,in the supply closet
14-08-2020T02:14:20,NezumiYuki,"Can y'all see Maddie wearing a pair of NVGs like Samp Phisher, running around in the halls of the Manor, only Rose aware of the shenanigans going on?   xD"
14-08-2020T02:14:31,AspiringNoodle,"seems legit, mystery solved"
14-08-2020T02:14:31,Dadrobit,Where was she hiding her supply cabinet?
14-08-2020T02:14:36,IraNovaki,... I though that was on the lower part of the room?
14-08-2020T02:14:53,AspiringNoodle,"Yuki, yes I can"
14-08-2020T02:14:54,FenceEqualizer,In the magic table. Robit.
14-08-2020T02:15:06,Twokinds,maddie is sneaky
14-08-2020T02:15:13,IraNovaki,Fair
14-08-2020T02:15:15,AspiringNoodle,stealth level 100
14-08-2020T02:15:28,NezumiYuki,Sam and Snake could learn a thing or two from Maddie!
14-08-2020T02:15:31,IraNovaki,*Insert Dragon ball meme*
14-08-2020T02:15:40,IraNovaki,Make it an additional 9000
14-08-2020T02:16:12,Twokinds,I wanted just a bit of levity in the darkness.
14-08-2020T02:16:42,NezumiYuki,Reni is sure going all BFG on everything though!
14-08-2020T02:16:53,BadFoMo,"Some say that when she was born, she just appered in her mother's arms when no one was looking."
14-08-2020T02:17:03,Dadrobit,Bound for greatness?
14-08-2020T02:17:11,FenceEqualizer,Speaking of Darkness Karen is way to relaxed for someone in a man made apocalypse.

14-08-2020T02:24:31,Twokinds,Karen was also waving a flag and eating popcorn while there was a demigod fighting in front of her heheh
14-08-2020T02:24:40,FenceEqualizer,"It just dawn on me, Trace made everything in this house right? So at some point he said. ""Okay I know this is the beach room and cheery but...now hear me out Rose.... what if darkness? Just, just... ominous darkness for those late nights."""

14-08-2020T02:25:20,unsteddyphoenix,They flicked the bloodmoon switch before attacking

14-08-2020T18:28:12,CrRAR,I have heard it discussed
14-08-2020T18:28:42,AspiringNoodle,It's a super hero / action anime on it' face
14-08-2020T18:28:51,AspiringNoodle,But it's really a character study
14-08-2020T18:29:02,CrRAR,oh cool
14-08-2020T18:29:12,AspiringNoodle,But it still has kickass fight scenes :)

14-08-2020T18:30:46,AspiringNoodle,"Personally, I don't like the english dub.  They try too hard to make Saitama sound cool"
14-08-2020T18:30:55,CrRAR,yeah I always go subs
14-08-2020T18:30:59,AspiringNoodle,The Japanese VA has an aloof quality that makes him the better version
14-08-2020T18:31:11,CrRAR,I just like hearing the original delivery/tone of the lines
14-08-2020T18:31:18,CrRAR,yeah
14-08-2020T18:32:14,Xexanoth,The only problem with OPM is that new chapters take so long because the art is incredibly good.
14-08-2020T18:32:46,CrRAR,makes sense
14-08-2020T18:35:05,AspiringNoodle,Fun tidbit:  The reason that OPM's story is so good is that it's based off a webcomic with rather silly art :ptv-laugh:
14-08-2020T18:35:28,AspiringNoodle,"The quality of the art is definitely not near a professional level, but the creator is a top-tier writer"
14-08-2020T18:35:56,Xexanoth,"yeah, and murata is a top tier artist, which makes for a killer kombo"
14-08-2020T18:36:09,AspiringNoodle,"The anime will regularly reference the original style, which just further enhances some of the characters"
14-08-2020T18:37:01,AspiringNoodle,"Also, OPM itself is mocking of the super hero genre tropes"
14-08-2020T18:37:24,AspiringNoodle,"The running joke is that Saitama is so stupidly powerful that now he only ever needs one punch, and is apathetic"
14-08-2020T18:37:55,AspiringNoodle,"And every time some super powerful dude comes along and gets his hopes up: one punch.  Frustration, despair, apathy, repeat."
14-08-2020T18:39:17,AspiringNoodle,Saitama really is just a wonderfully entertaining character
14-08-2020T18:39:39,AspiringNoodle,"And whenever he puts on his serious face, you know it's gonna git gud :ptv-excited:"
14-08-2020T18:42:19,AspiringNoodle,"Next episode started, nailed it"
14-08-2020T18:42:31,AspiringNoodle,Saitama freaking out because tomorrow him is now today him :ptv-laugh:
