05-08-2020T08:07:03,Dadrobit,They already have Doritos Tacos and they love their Mountain Dew
05-08-2020T08:08:50,Dadrobit,I have half a mind to try and make it myself.

05-08-2020T08:13:53,CrRAR,or maybe just orange cream ones or something
05-08-2020T08:14:49,Dadrobit,The mountain dew creamsicle is messing with my head.
05-08-2020T08:15:13,Dadrobit,Throwing in that it has a Doritos Crust is actually wild
05-08-2020T08:16:00,Dadrobit,"Like, you could do it with Cool Ranch Doritos for extra fuckery."

05-08-2020T08:17:16,CrRAR,Just like bleu cheese on buffalo chicken
05-08-2020T08:17:27,CrRAR,Sounds hella complementary
05-08-2020T08:17:43,Dadrobit,"Oh, I don't doubt the creamsicle cheesecake. It's the mountain dew creamsicle that's blowing my taste buds' minds."

05-08-2020T19:33:54,CrRAR,Yeah most things just come slathered with maple syrup or with a side of cheese I hear
05-08-2020T19:33:56,Ordithus,I think a bell pepper is about the limit for most locals

05-08-2020T19:38:55,CrRAR,Taters are pretty versatile
05-08-2020T19:39:18,CrRAR,Isn’t that like the capital of fry boats with exotic toppings?

05-08-2020T19:52:05,CrRAR,Oo frozen critters?
05-08-2020T19:52:26,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m not about to set up to raise feeder mice
05-08-2020T19:52:44,CrRAR,Yeah that seems cruel
05-08-2020T19:53:25,SpazztasticKiwi,"these will be farmed mice from a nutritional, healthy, and regulated breeder"
05-08-2020T19:54:29,SpazztasticKiwi,the mice are fed the best diet for the best growth
05-08-2020T19:54:42,SpazztasticKiwi,and live mice can be dangerous

05-08-2020T19:55:44,CrRAR,Was getting those emojis ready
05-08-2020T19:55:45,SpazztasticKiwi,they can bite the snake & create great wounds that breed infection
05-08-2020T19:56:26,SpazztasticKiwi,"& if the mouse bites the head, they can damage an eye, the jaw, or puncture the brain and kill the snake"
05-08-2020T19:56:31,Ordithus,probably more dangerous in captivity since the mice can't just run instead
05-08-2020T19:56:38,Ordithus,gotta fight or be dinner

05-08-2020T21:38:35,SpazztasticKiwi,alot of anime critique ends up being comparisons anyway rather than based on what could be done or what was done for the actual subject

05-08-2020T22:11:52,SpazztasticKiwi,because they go home with someone else at the end of the day
