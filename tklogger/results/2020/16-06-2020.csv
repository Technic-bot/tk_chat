16-06-2020T10:45:54,AspiringNoodle,I'm waiting for the day that serious enough competition comes out that forces Adobe to adopt a more consumer-friendly model
16-06-2020T10:47:03,AspiringNoodle,Because there is no way in heck they are innovating programs like Photoshop enough to justify the obscene pricing of their subs

16-06-2020T17:59:04,Ordithus,never been interested in them
16-06-2020T17:59:45,AspiringNoodle,I'm usually interested in horror survival where you can fight back
16-06-2020T18:00:05,AspiringNoodle,"But I'm starting to appreciate the ""NOPE"" genre"
16-06-2020T18:09:49,SpazztasticKiwi,what’s a good backup chip for laptop
16-06-2020T18:11:23,Ordithus,huh?
16-06-2020T18:11:50,SpazztasticKiwi,a chip
16-06-2020T18:11:55,SpazztasticKiwi,for laptops
16-06-2020T18:13:05,Ordithus,do you mean backup harddrive?
16-06-2020T18:23:27,SpazztasticKiwi,is there anything else
16-06-2020T18:23:49,Ordithus,your words confuse me
16-06-2020T18:23:59,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s a chip
16-06-2020T18:24:04,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s chip sized
16-06-2020T18:24:17,Ordithus,but can you eat it
16-06-2020T18:24:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I wouldn’t dip it in ranch but it’s a chip
16-06-2020T18:25:25,Ordithus,so pretty much any big ole external drive will do.  something with twice or more the space on your laptop will pretty well never come close to running out
16-06-2020T18:25:36,Ordithus,western digital and seagate have both worked for me
16-06-2020T18:26:13,Ordithus,"if you want to travel with it get a ""portable"" one so you don't have to plug it in to the wall"
16-06-2020T18:26:41,SpazztasticKiwi,I only want something that can hold something like 365 22 minute videos
16-06-2020T18:27:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I want to store the ones I got downloaded before I reset the laptop
16-06-2020T18:28:07,Ordithus,do you know what size one of those videos is?
16-06-2020T18:28:52,SpazztasticKiwi,"they’re not all 22, and really that’s an extreme - most are 15-20, one or two are 30"
16-06-2020T18:29:03,SpazztasticKiwi,but they’re at...720p
16-06-2020T18:29:30,SpazztasticKiwi,the 100 some odd I have now is 8.64 gbish
16-06-2020T18:29:46,Ordithus,that's smaller than I was thinking
16-06-2020T18:30:11,SpazztasticKiwi,"yeah, the 22 per is overkill so I can maybe store other things like pictures too"
16-06-2020T18:30:33,SpazztasticKiwi,and make sure there’s more than enough rather than too short
16-06-2020T18:31:01,Ordithus,if 100 of the videos is less than 9 gb you don't really need a really big drive
16-06-2020T18:32:05,Ordithus,250 gb which is pretty affordable ought to be way more than enough
16-06-2020T18:32:51,SpazztasticKiwi,I have some 5 gb drives that have the documents and pictures but like anything more than a handful of the videos said it was too much
16-06-2020T18:33:26,SpazztasticKiwi,so I may get ANOTHER drive instead of a chip but it’s the sizing I need to know
16-06-2020T18:33:29,Ordithus,this ought to do - there's many more options https://www.bestbuy.com/site/pny-elite-turbo-attache-4-256gb-usb-3-0-type-a-flash-drive-black-gray/6236000.p?skuId=6236000
16-06-2020T18:33:48,Ordithus,I 'member when a 1gb card was $$$
16-06-2020T18:34:24,SpazztasticKiwi,yeah that’s when my drives are from
16-06-2020T18:34:37,SpazztasticKiwi,hs - still have something like 4 of them
16-06-2020T18:34:45,SpazztasticKiwi,learned how to password lock two
16-06-2020T18:35:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t have a best buy
16-06-2020T18:35:52,Ordithus,I'm sure you can find something just like that at yer office
16-06-2020T18:36:26,Ordithus,"look for usb 3.0 or 3.1, they are much faster for writing files"
