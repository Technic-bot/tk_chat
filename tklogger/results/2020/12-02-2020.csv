12-02-2020T12:35:16,SonOfGoku,Good morning
12-02-2020T12:37:19,CrimsonQuill,Hi
12-02-2020T12:37:24,CrimsonQuill,Playing Arma 3
12-02-2020T12:37:31,SonOfGoku,Hi Quill
12-02-2020T12:40:13,AspiringNoodle,*yawn* such a good slep
12-02-2020T12:40:18,AspiringNoodle,Even though I had too much dew :c
12-02-2020T12:40:46,SonOfGoku,Morning Noodle
12-02-2020T12:42:28,AspiringNoodle,"Good to know, 8.5 hours seems to be good enough for me :P"
12-02-2020T12:42:45,AspiringNoodle,"At least, with caffeine / restroom disturbed sleep, lol"
12-02-2020T12:43:49,AspiringNoodle,I see you are also wearing hat
12-02-2020T12:44:08,SonOfGoku,I haven’t taken it off yet
12-02-2020T12:44:15,AspiringNoodle,I say christmas in july
12-02-2020T12:44:21,AspiringNoodle,Then take it off :ptv-snicker:
12-02-2020T12:44:59,SonOfGoku,I was tempted to put on a happy new year hat for New Years but I forgot
12-02-2020T12:58:45,AspiringNoodle,Weird question
12-02-2020T12:58:56,AspiringNoodle,"Is it possible to be unhappy with a job because it's ""boring""?"
12-02-2020T13:07:20,SonOfGoku,I would probably say it is possible because I found myself board at a previous job I had because I had nothing to work on and was wasting my morning doing nothing
12-02-2020T13:07:42,AspiringNoodle,"I kinda have the opposite problem, lol"
12-02-2020T13:08:00,AspiringNoodle,I have all the things to do but they're so brain dead because they're routine
12-02-2020T13:08:36,AspiringNoodle,"If I had to metaphorize it, ""boredom"" would just be the sprinkles or decorative icing on a cake."
12-02-2020T13:09:13,AspiringNoodle,*works in retail*
12-02-2020T13:09:17,SonOfGoku,I can see why that would be boring
12-02-2020T13:09:18,AspiringNoodle,*doesn't really do small talk*
12-02-2020T13:09:28,AspiringNoodle,"*da fuq am I doing here, ahahahahahahahaha*"
12-02-2020T13:09:57,SonOfGoku,I have worked in two manufacturing companies and in construction
12-02-2020T13:10:55,SonOfGoku,I’m going to be trying something new by working for an engineering firm over the summer
12-02-2020T13:16:27,AspiringNoodle,"It's just one of those things where even though we get $10 an hour (close enough, $9.50), we're a small store with below 15 employees or so"
12-02-2020T13:16:37,AspiringNoodle,And there's just so much to do >_>
12-02-2020T13:17:00,AspiringNoodle,"Suffice to say, very little interests me, lol"
12-02-2020T13:18:13,AspiringNoodle,"I tell you, there shouldn't be so much hussle / chaos at a convenience store!"
12-02-2020T13:18:18,SonOfGoku,That’s why I never went into retail
12-02-2020T13:18:45,AspiringNoodle,"I hold the opinion that everyone should work retail once, if only to show that some people are just aholes"
12-02-2020T13:19:53,AspiringNoodle,"""Oh, pumps aren't working and you're super pissed off?  Yes, feel free to yell at the part-time, minimum wage employee who has absolutely no control over the situation and ruin their day / potentially traumatize them."
12-02-2020T13:20:35,AspiringNoodle,"Keep in mind that if this was a small Mom & Pop shop, I'd kindly ask you to f*ck off and never return."" :upside_down:"
12-02-2020T13:21:40,AspiringNoodle,"...Imagine if a new company became a giant chain, and a huge part of their success was, ""We welcome all customers, but if you're an a-hole, get the f*ck out of our store."""
12-02-2020T13:23:01,AspiringNoodle,*sigh* I need to swear less.
12-02-2020T13:23:28,SonOfGoku,That would be an interesting store motto
12-02-2020T13:24:12,SonOfGoku,My friends are always telling me that I should start swearing
12-02-2020T13:27:56,AspiringNoodle,"Meh.  Be careful, the business world is SUPER prudish, lol"
12-02-2020T13:28:10,AspiringNoodle,Some of my coworkers are WAAAAAAAAAAAAY too high energy for me
12-02-2020T13:28:20,AspiringNoodle,"And I remember being told that ""damn"" is not an acceptable word to use"
12-02-2020T13:29:06,AspiringNoodle,"And as a result just standing there thinking, ""Really?  What are we, children?  If someone is offended by the word 'damn', then they're probably some super religious person that non-super religious people hate anyways."""
12-02-2020T13:29:51,AspiringNoodle,"Especially considering the proliferation of swears, slangs, and innuendos in modern society..."
12-02-2020T13:30:30,SonOfGoku,"I have yet to start but it’s a running joke between my friends that whenever someone swears, they will always blame me"
12-02-2020T13:33:30,AspiringNoodle,"Btw, should mention that my coworkers are generally awesome people"
12-02-2020T13:33:49,AspiringNoodle,But it does seem like some of them HAVE to do this job
12-02-2020T13:34:11,AspiringNoodle,"I'm there because my other part time job is still bi-monthly, and I have loans to pay, lol"
12-02-2020T13:34:27,AspiringNoodle,"But for the most part, I don't have an immediate need to work there"
12-02-2020T13:37:09,SonOfGoku,Didn’t you said a while ago that you wanted to go into game development?
12-02-2020T13:37:29,AspiringNoodle,"Still a possibility, but the AAA landscape is a complete shitshow sans a few select companies"
12-02-2020T13:37:47,AspiringNoodle,"And if I DO want to get into it, I better brush up on my coding skills!"
12-02-2020T13:38:23,AspiringNoodle,"TBH, the games industry is probably in for another 1980's style crash, though to a lesser extent"
12-02-2020T13:38:42,CrimsonQuill,Back from Arma 3
12-02-2020T13:38:52,CrimsonQuill,"Also, whadya mean Crash Noodle?"
12-02-2020T13:39:33,AspiringNoodle,"The games industry has gotten SUPER predatory with its microtransactions, to the point that games like GTA V had added literal casinos to their game"
12-02-2020T13:39:45,CrimsonQuill,Ah.
12-02-2020T13:39:49,CrimsonQuill,Those things.
12-02-2020T13:39:59,AspiringNoodle,"Games have been getting gambling-esque mechanics added to their microtransaction systems, causing people to get addicted to blowing all their money on a single game"
12-02-2020T13:40:03,CrimsonQuill,I am personally worried about Halo infinite having microtransactions.
12-02-2020T13:40:31,AspiringNoodle,"Publishers more or less have built their entire business model around predatory, addictive, and, in all reality, ILLEGAL practices"
12-02-2020T13:41:11,CrimsonQuill,"My hope is that the players will realise that to stop these practices, maybe it'd be better to just boycott the games"
12-02-2020T13:41:19,CrimsonQuill,Or boycott the transactions
12-02-2020T13:41:21,AspiringNoodle,"And the games rating boards are culpable, too"
12-02-2020T13:41:28,CrimsonQuill,???
12-02-2020T13:41:34,AspiringNoodle,"They're defending the practices, even having some games rated at the lowest age bracket"
12-02-2020T13:41:43,AspiringNoodle,FIFA?  The world's biggest soccer game?
12-02-2020T13:42:04,AspiringNoodle,PEGI-3 / E
12-02-2020T13:42:22,AspiringNoodle,Online multiplayer features card packs that you buy to unlock players
12-02-2020T13:42:37,CrimsonQuill,opens steam valves to prevent rant buildup
12-02-2020T13:42:39,AspiringNoodle,Features the same mechanics other loot boxes use AND is pay-to-win in its implementation
12-02-2020T13:43:00,CrimsonQuill,Disgusting.
12-02-2020T13:43:19,AspiringNoodle,"Shadow of War (you know, the really good LotR games?), the 2nd one had loot boxes"
12-02-2020T13:43:40,AspiringNoodle,But its about to blow up
12-02-2020T13:44:13,AspiringNoodle,"Governments in the US and Europe are getting heavily involved.  At this point, the games industry is so beholden to these business models that it will most likely end up with government regulation"
12-02-2020T13:44:42,CrimsonQuill,The good or the bad sort
12-02-2020T13:44:47,CrimsonQuill,Actually scratch that
12-02-2020T13:44:48,AspiringNoodle,"As YongYea once said, you know the games industry is in a bad place when you PRAISE a game for NOT having microtransactions"
12-02-2020T13:45:08,CrimsonQuill,ANY government involvment will probably be bad.
12-02-2020T13:45:27,CrimsonQuill,"Because there'll start to be certain ""no-go"" zones for any game"
12-02-2020T13:45:34,CrimsonQuill,That really should be left alone
12-02-2020T13:45:51,AspiringNoodle,"Yeah, no, they'll probably overstep their bounds.  But at this point, is it any worse than games being made so addictive that players spend thousands of dollars, or kids wipe out their parents bank accounts?"
12-02-2020T13:46:00,AspiringNoodle,And then the industry does almost nothing to prevent this?
12-02-2020T13:46:19,CrimsonQuill,I have to admit.
12-02-2020T13:46:24,CrimsonQuill,Some of it might be our fault.
12-02-2020T13:46:28,CrimsonQuill,For accepting it.
12-02-2020T13:46:54,CrimsonQuill,(pleasedon'tkillmepleasedon'tkillmepleasedon'tkillme)
12-02-2020T13:47:58,AspiringNoodle,"Oh no, gamers as a whole are responsible for letting it get this far"
12-02-2020T13:48:14,AspiringNoodle,Just as we are responsible for big franchises going to yearly releases and then buying every single one
12-02-2020T13:48:39,CrimsonQuill,A problem of both sides.
12-02-2020T13:49:06,AspiringNoodle,But just because we're just as responsible for the state of things doesn't mean the companies are any less in the wrong for making poor moral and ethical choices
12-02-2020T13:49:42,CrimsonQuill,"Neither does it disguise the fact that both parties-us as gamers, and them as developers-need to tackle the problem head on."
12-02-2020T13:49:50,CrimsonQuill,We have to boycott thee transactions
12-02-2020T13:49:58,CrimsonQuill,They have to stop making them so insidious
12-02-2020T13:50:01,CrimsonQuill,And aggressive
12-02-2020T13:53:05,CrimsonQuill,It's just the biggest damn mess...
12-02-2020T13:53:17,AspiringNoodle,The problem is that most gamers don't pay any attention to the games they're buying
12-02-2020T13:53:33,AspiringNoodle,Or they don't care enough to change their habits
12-02-2020T13:54:30,AspiringNoodle,"And those are the people who also tend to end up indulging in these increasingly horrible business practices, only serving to incentivize further implementation"
12-02-2020T13:58:12,CrimsonQuill,The world is killing me
