05-04-2020T00:00:37,JojoF2415,Even the owner of the reptile store that I go too was surprised
05-04-2020T00:01:06,JojoF2415,He asked what I feed him
05-04-2020T00:01:18,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-RainezZz: nighty night

05-04-2020T00:02:29,Ordithus,your honor means nothing to me
05-04-2020T00:02:32,DarthRexKing,ni ni.
05-04-2020T00:02:44,Ordithus,zzz
05-04-2020T00:02:48,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs not mine that‚Äôs going down the drain
05-04-2020T00:02:59,JojoF2415,I had a good weekend
05-04-2020T00:03:20,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve had work
05-04-2020T00:03:40,SpazztasticKiwi,people are getting stupider and I‚Äôm wondering if that‚Äôs the real virus
05-04-2020T00:03:57,JojoF2415,I made my best drawing. I beat 2 demons and clutterfunk in Geometry Dash. I made a drawing of Ultra Instinct Kathrin
05-04-2020T00:04:36,SpazztasticKiwi,"‚Äúwash your hands often, don‚Äôt be touching your face, and keep good distances from each other‚Äù"
05-04-2020T00:04:45,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúWERE ALL GONNA DIE‚Äù
05-04-2020T00:04:58,JojoF2415,one of those demons was deadlocked. That level was frustrating
05-04-2020T00:05:05,SpazztasticKiwi,no wonder they won‚Äôt say anything about aliens
05-04-2020T00:05:08,JojoF2415,I have a replay of it
05-04-2020T00:05:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm back to half life for awhile
05-04-2020T00:06:37,JojoF2415,"9 months of practice, 5088 attempts. Over 25 fails above 70%"
05-04-2020T00:06:57,Dadrobit,o/ Ord
05-04-2020T00:07:57,JojoF2415,"Not as bad as god eater easy which was 11521 attempts, 7 months, 1 97% fail"
05-04-2020T00:08:37,JojoF2415,Also bugs that instantly killed me
05-04-2020T00:10:21,JojoF2415,Im glad that‚Äôs over
05-04-2020T00:11:40,JojoF2415,Deadlocked I kept on dying on the same spot. I gave up on it then came back

05-04-2020T00:17:08,AspiringNoodle,"Hmmm, might not need to quit Fortnite after an obscene amount of time"
05-04-2020T00:17:15,AspiringNoodle,"2 games in and it already crashed, lol"
05-04-2020T00:18:18,AspiringNoodle,Let's see how the stability holds up
05-04-2020T00:18:27,AspiringNoodle,"Straight up, one of the things I look for in live services is stability :)"
05-04-2020T00:20:41,KeefMcDerpface,"Noodle, are you dabbing on all the players you down/kill?"
05-04-2020T00:21:07,AspiringNoodle,"Not yet, but that's a good idea..."
05-04-2020T00:21:15,AspiringNoodle,"Reequip the default dance, do it for every kill, lmao"
05-04-2020T00:21:21,JojoF2415,Rip
05-04-2020T00:21:25,AspiringNoodle,"Fun fact, Fortnite players are notoriously stupid"
05-04-2020T00:21:31,KeefMcDerpface,Yep
05-04-2020T00:21:33,JojoF2415,Indeed
05-04-2020T00:21:34,AspiringNoodle,"They equate default skins as to ""no skill"""
05-04-2020T00:21:45,AspiringNoodle,"So if you can outplay them with a default skin, they get REALLY mad"
05-04-2020T00:21:55,KeefMcDerpface,That's why I don't play that game.
05-04-2020T00:22:08,AspiringNoodle,"There's actually a good video somewhere about a guy using a default skin, and beating people in build-off duels"
05-04-2020T00:22:51,KeefMcDerpface,"Yeah, there's a good number of vids of players out playing others in default skins."
05-04-2020T00:22:53,JojoF2415,Only game I really don‚Äôt get mad is Minecraft
05-04-2020T00:23:00,AspiringNoodle,I'm kinda tempted to do that :)
05-04-2020T00:23:52,KeefMcDerpface,":ptv-sad: Tbh, I use the default skin in most games."
05-04-2020T00:24:08,AspiringNoodle,"Hell, that last match I beat another player using all the legendary weapons with a fugging green tactical shotgun xD"
05-04-2020T00:24:18,KeefMcDerpface,lol
05-04-2020T00:24:30,AspiringNoodle,"They had a legendary assault rifle (full auto), legendary / named minigun, and a legendary heavy sniper rifle"
05-04-2020T00:24:50,AspiringNoodle,"2 crashes, 4 games"
05-04-2020T00:24:57,AspiringNoodle,Might need to change the game from windowed to full screen
05-04-2020T00:25:32,KeefMcDerpface,":thinking: You know, I wonder if there's a clan where everyone one uses default skins."

05-04-2020T00:26:15,KeefMcDerpface,Let me check.
05-04-2020T00:26:30,AspiringNoodle,"There's no way a multi-billion dollar FREE-TO-PLAY GAME can still be ""early access"""
05-04-2020T00:27:17,AspiringNoodle,"hmmm, that might have done it"
05-04-2020T00:27:25,KeefMcDerpface,"Ok, apparently 2017 is when the game became big."

05-04-2020T00:49:41,JojoF2415,I called my cat Nino after months of having him

05-04-2020T00:52:00,JojoF2415,I called him kitty but yes he was nameless until the day I got him his shot

05-04-2020T14:10:16,CrimsonQuill,Ooh nice
05-04-2020T14:10:44,CrimsonQuill,I did see a few pieces on your page when I checked it out before my TK Withdrawal.
05-04-2020T14:10:54,CrimsonQuill,You're really good with colouring pencils.
05-04-2020T14:11:01,CrimsonQuill,I hope to be that good soon.
05-04-2020T14:11:26,CrimsonQuill,Ultra-Instinct Kathrin would be a sight to see..

05-04-2020T14:16:41,SonOfGoku,I'd be interested in seeing it too
05-04-2020T14:17:19,JojoF2415,It started as a sketch then i decided to color it. It was a expiriment
05-04-2020T14:18:46,JojoF2415,Also most of my drawings are made with marker not color pencils
05-04-2020T14:21:01,JojoF2415,Also I'm fixing the chicken pen so they can start making chicks
05-04-2020T14:21:16,JojoF2415,I have already about 20 eggs
05-04-2020T14:21:36,JojoF2415,Im getting the hay today
05-04-2020T14:23:59,CrimsonQuill,We used to have a lot of chickens.
05-04-2020T14:24:10,CrimsonQuill,"Most of them grew old and died, or were killed by foxes."
05-04-2020T14:24:20,CrimsonQuill,We do have one hen and a cockerel left.
05-04-2020T14:24:36,CrimsonQuill,But mostly we have...ducks...most of which are drakes...
05-04-2020T14:25:14,CrimsonQuill,"A lot of them are Muscovy ducks, but we have one Khaki Campbell, named Cyclops...at least, I think...I haven't been at home for a while, so I don't know"
05-04-2020T14:25:38,CrimsonQuill,But good on you Jojo for having a go at hatching chicks!
05-04-2020T14:26:19,CrimsonQuill,"We did that when our Peahen, Penelope, had a little...ahem...quality time with her spouse, Perceval."
05-04-2020T14:26:43,CrimsonQuill,Result: A good few Peachicks. Most were given away to friends
05-04-2020T14:27:00,JojoF2415,My chicken once sat on 20 eggs
05-04-2020T14:27:02,CrimsonQuill,"We have Lucky, however-as handsome a Peacock as his father was in life...."
05-04-2020T14:27:08,CrimsonQuill,20 eggs! Lummee!
05-04-2020T14:27:15,CrimsonQuill,That happened with out ducks once
05-04-2020T14:27:29,CrimsonQuill,One went missing-she came back with Ducklings
05-04-2020T14:28:12,CrimsonQuill,How many hatched?
05-04-2020T14:28:19,JojoF2415,I had a peackock

05-04-2020T14:29:29,JojoF2415,I gave him away becuase he needed a mate

05-04-2020T14:33:00,CrimsonQuill,Dangerous things
05-04-2020T14:33:25,JojoF2415,A man that i met in a reptile store says he breed those type of snakes
05-04-2020T14:33:50,JojoF2415,He said they are aggresive
05-04-2020T14:34:06,CrimsonQuill,Ooof
05-04-2020T14:34:21,JojoF2415,He recommended me to let him bite me to the point it knows it can't do anything
05-04-2020T14:34:40,JojoF2415,Basically tame it
05-04-2020T14:35:01,SpazztasticKiwi,no professional snake breeder ‚Äúknows‚Äù their broods bite until they get used to humans
05-04-2020T14:35:22,SpazztasticKiwi,captive bred snakes are supposed to be used to humans if handled correctly
05-04-2020T14:36:07,JojoF2415,jungle carpet pythons are defensive snakes
05-04-2020T14:36:23,SpazztasticKiwi,so are rat snakes
05-04-2020T14:36:53,SpazztasticKiwi,but captive rats are relatively calm when bred and raised captive
05-04-2020T14:37:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"not to say a bred snake will never bite, that‚Äôs got to do with the owner feeding and caring and handling it correctly"
05-04-2020T14:38:43,CrimsonQuill,Hi there Spazz
05-04-2020T14:38:49,CrimsonQuill,How're you?
05-04-2020T14:40:25,JojoF2415,My snake was extremely aggresive when I got him. Hes calmed down tho
05-04-2020T14:42:18,JojoF2415,I just got to get him used to being handled
05-04-2020T14:42:36,JojoF2415,im leaving now. Got to do work
05-04-2020T14:44:02,CrimsonQuill,Okay cya Jojo

05-04-2020T19:11:09,CrRAR,You a pro now
05-04-2020T19:11:23,AspiringNoodle,Beastars plot poorly explained
05-04-2020T19:11:39,AspiringNoodle,Beastars is a just a fugged up version of Zootopia.
05-04-2020T19:11:41,AspiringNoodle,The end :D
05-04-2020T19:11:43,BlackjackSec99,wahl? what model?

05-04-2020T19:11:52,AspiringNoodle,The all in one
05-04-2020T19:11:56,BlackjackSec99,o
05-04-2020T19:12:15,AspiringNoodle,I gave it a shot because it was only $22 + tax
05-04-2020T19:12:20,BlackjackSec99,"sorry, the sharpener/clipper servicer is curious"
05-04-2020T19:12:42,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-adiracoin: cost economical
05-04-2020T19:12:47,BlackjackSec99,is it one of the cordless ones?
05-04-2020T19:12:50,AspiringNoodle,"Philips had a grooming tool that's much more slim than this, and looks like a more traditional razor with a stupidly fat handle"
05-04-2020T19:12:53,BlackjackSec99,L-ion?
05-04-2020T19:12:55,AspiringNoodle,And it was $36 + tax
05-04-2020T19:13:11,AspiringNoodle,"Yeah.  Cordless with charging cord, says ~80 min per charge"
05-04-2020T19:13:21,BlackjackSec99,ahh! I have one of those.
05-04-2020T19:13:39,CrRAR,"Haha, if ya gotta use it that long you‚Äôre doing something wrong"
05-04-2020T19:14:06,BlackjackSec99,"do yourself one huge favor. find someone who does clipper blade sharpening and have it sharpened, they arent well done from the factory. other than that its a great little clipper."
05-04-2020T19:14:53,CrRAR,The lil clip that could
05-04-2020T19:14:57,AspiringNoodle,Looks like I got the 9685 with NiMh battery
05-04-2020T19:15:07,BlackjackSec99,it really is...
05-04-2020T19:15:10,BlackjackSec99,still a good one
05-04-2020T19:15:13,BlackjackSec99,I like mine
05-04-2020T19:15:25,BlackjackSec99,"and yeah, battery lasts me a while"
05-04-2020T19:16:23,AspiringNoodle,I'm not too concerned about the battery
05-04-2020T19:16:36,AspiringNoodle,"I've been using norelco shavers forever, and they use the same kind"
05-04-2020T19:17:00,AspiringNoodle,The reason I got this one is that the pop up trimmer on my shaver finally died
05-04-2020T19:17:17,AspiringNoodle,"After going through 2 of those trimmers, I figure it's time for a dedicated trimmer"
05-04-2020T19:18:01,CrRAR,Beard of steel
05-04-2020T19:18:58,AspiringNoodle,I've started just trimming my beard instead of going for a full shave
05-04-2020T19:19:06,BlackjackSec99,same
05-04-2020T19:19:25,AspiringNoodle,"I don't want to bother with a traditional razer, and to do a full shave with an electric one takes forever"
05-04-2020T19:19:27,BlackjackSec99,"its close enough, and I dont attend any fancy events so...."
05-04-2020T19:19:39,AspiringNoodle,"Because I'm overweight, some hairs don't like peeking out all the day and so I can still feel rough spots"
05-04-2020T19:20:06,AspiringNoodle,And to get everything either A) takes forever and/or B) gives me multiple nicks
05-04-2020T19:20:36,AspiringNoodle,"So I shave my wannabe mustache, and trim the beard."
05-04-2020T19:20:52,AspiringNoodle,"The fine stubble doesn't bother me.  Uniform length, close enough to look like I shaved~"
05-04-2020T20:21:54,K3IDRAN,"Sup, peeps."
05-04-2020T20:28:41,AspiringNoodle,I like my new trimmer~
05-04-2020T20:28:57,HoverdudeXL,helloo
05-04-2020T20:29:07,AspiringNoodle,It's got some length combs that are sooooooo nice for trimming areas that I had a tendency to nick before
05-04-2020T20:29:33,HoverdudeXL,hallo noodle
05-04-2020T20:29:35,AspiringNoodle,You wouldn't think you could nick your chest
05-04-2020T20:29:37,AspiringNoodle,"You'd be wrong, lol"
05-04-2020T20:29:57,AspiringNoodle,"Everything is possible, hover @w@"
05-04-2020T20:30:09,HoverdudeXL,truu
05-04-2020T20:30:34,HoverdudeXL,i did the 10 dollar sketch thing on patreon
05-04-2020T20:30:43,AspiringNoodle,"Compared to the pop-up trimmers on my electric razors, this thing is scary! xD"
05-04-2020T20:30:46,HoverdudeXL,well i subscribed to it
05-04-2020T20:31:05,AspiringNoodle,But now I look at it like Terry Crews in Old Spice commercials
