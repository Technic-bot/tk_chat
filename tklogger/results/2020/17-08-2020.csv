17-08-2020T00:00:05,AspiringNoodle,"That said, the Focus has a ridiculous large trunk for a compact"
17-08-2020T00:00:33,CrRAR,Yeah my brothers 01 focus was good and functional
17-08-2020T00:00:58,Dadrobit,06 here. Still functional
17-08-2020T00:01:26,CrRAR,Yeah they got pretty styled too later that decade
17-08-2020T00:01:38,Dadrobit,And so much room for activities
17-08-2020T00:02:15,CrRAR,"haha yeah, kinda copied the beetle semi-circleness"
17-08-2020T00:03:02,CrRAR,Like that commercial where the guy was like “It’s a half circle” that means S P A C E
17-08-2020T00:03:11,CrRAR,haha
17-08-2020T00:03:21,Dadrobit,Unfamiliar
17-08-2020T00:04:54,CrRAR,I remember the guy is like standing at an overlook at like the roman aquaducts (because arches) and he gets out and goes on about the timelessness and utility of the design
17-08-2020T00:05:03,Dadrobit,"Gotta say, I'm recently newly aware of how much driver space there is in my wee Focus. Had to drive a Equinox for a week, and even though physically it's like 2.5x the size and cargo capacity, the driver cockpit just felt cramped."
17-08-2020T00:05:10,Dadrobit,Very weird sensation.
17-08-2020T00:05:22,CrRAR,Now that I think of it it’s a very “Apple” style commercial
17-08-2020T00:05:32,Dadrobit,"Ohh, ya know what, I think I remember something like that!"
17-08-2020T00:05:46,CrRAR,Yeah now I got to find it on youtube lol
17-08-2020T00:06:06,CrRAR,Yeah some car design is just bad
17-08-2020T00:06:09,Dadrobit,"That's gotta be a really old commercial, I haven't had TV in over a decade."
17-08-2020T00:06:27,CrRAR,"Yeah, like early ‘naughts most likely"
17-08-2020T00:07:22,CrRAR,"Bad car design is usually the result of “spahgetti code” phenomenon, they rework old platforms to something new without actually rebuilding from the ground up"
17-08-2020T00:09:04,CrRAR,"Another thing I always find hilarious is that American Car companies rename models like clockwork to hide past sentiment, yet others reinvent cars as something new and better and keep the same names."
17-08-2020T00:09:13,Dadrobit,"My use of cockpit was also very intentional. It legit felt like a cockpit of a cramped plane. Looked kinda cool, not great for long drives/commutes."
17-08-2020T00:09:59,CrRAR,"Yeah, some make things cramped because they want the driver to feel cosy and ‘safe’, I don’t like it either"
17-08-2020T00:10:12,Dadrobit,Volkswagen does that renaming thing. Rabbit became the Golf.
17-08-2020T00:10:42,Dadrobit,(I only know that one because I had a rabbit. Fucking hated it)
17-08-2020T00:11:05,CrRAR,"Yeah VW has had some questionable issues, though I only know of the jetta being somewhat mechanically problematic for some time"
17-08-2020T00:11:26,CrRAR,They retired the beetle a year or whatever ago
17-08-2020T00:11:30,Dadrobit,Rabbit actually turned me off of hatchbacks for years. I was suuuuuper hesitant to get my focus actually.
17-08-2020T00:11:47,CrRAR,"And tbh, for being a beetle, it wasn’t that terribly bad loking w/ the new design"
17-08-2020T00:12:01,Dadrobit,RIP punchbug games for future generations of road trips.
17-08-2020T00:12:09,CrRAR,ikr
17-08-2020T00:12:40,Dadrobit,Rabbit was a mechanical nightmare as well.
17-08-2020T00:12:53,Dadrobit,That engine bay was a nightmare
17-08-2020T00:13:39,CrRAR,I almost likened the “new” beetle design to like a stretched-tall porsche. Not that it at all resembled the sexy of a porsche tho
17-08-2020T00:13:43,CrRAR,lol
17-08-2020T00:14:06,CrRAR,Yeah sometimes it looks like the engineers forgot a car needs ALL those parts.
17-08-2020T00:14:13,Dadrobit,The Focus has issues as well. Wanna replace the air filter? Start by removing the fucking side paneling of the vehicle.
17-08-2020T00:14:25,Dadrobit,I shit you not
17-08-2020T00:14:31,CrRAR,“A... steering column... like WHAT isthat?”
17-08-2020T00:15:22,CrRAR,"Oh yeah, I hate the cars that are like: remove the tire, and the wheel cowel thing. Congrats, now you can change a lightbulb!"

17-08-2020T00:16:25,Dadrobit,"It's the worst. The heat cracks those tabs so they become one time use, then you're fucked."
17-08-2020T00:16:49,CrRAR,"Yup, and a baggie of 4 is like 10.99 xD"
17-08-2020T00:17:00,CrRAR,“Make em count BOYS!”
17-08-2020T00:17:16,Dadrobit,I've specifically been meaning to do a cold air intake mod for my car. I can't imagine 150k miles on a  single air filter is great for the air flow.
17-08-2020T00:17:44,CrRAR,Yeah probably not
17-08-2020T00:17:57,Dadrobit,"They essentially put in a tractor sized air filter and said, ""this is fine for the life of the vehicle"""
17-08-2020T00:18:22,Dadrobit,"Which means they have a ton of faith in the filter, or shit faith in the car."
17-08-2020T00:18:35,AspiringNoodle,why not both?
17-08-2020T00:18:54,CrRAR,"I mean, if you look at studies maybe not changing it can effect mpgs/performance like 10 percent maybe idk"
17-08-2020T00:20:27,CrRAR,I used to look at the benchmarks and what not on those intakes a lot of times it seemed a RAM air is usually the way to go (though maybe not on a focus with the engine bay)
17-08-2020T00:20:49,CrRAR,CAI is super awsome and def wins the cool factor tho
17-08-2020T00:20:56,CrRAR,:ptv-dealwithit:
17-08-2020T00:21:20,Dadrobit,That's me. Mr Cool driving his yellow as fuck 06 hatchback.
17-08-2020T00:21:33,CrRAR,I think the science boils down to that air volume is superior to the chilliness benefit I guess
17-08-2020T00:21:55,CrRAR,Lots of the CAIs are like sucking cold air through a straw
17-08-2020T00:22:07,CrRAR,Though I have seen hybrid styles
17-08-2020T00:22:07,Dadrobit,"I'm pretty sure ""Yello As Fuck"" is the official name for my color."
17-08-2020T00:22:13,CrRAR,haha
17-08-2020T00:22:28,CrRAR,That color is pretty classiq
17-08-2020T00:22:36,Dadrobit,"You know what, I'm leaving that typo. For the cool factor."
17-08-2020T00:22:47,CrRAR,works
17-08-2020T00:24:13,CrRAR,The challenger has the T/A model which has that cool factory mod where the CAI is literally piped to the headlight area on the grille
17-08-2020T00:24:33,CrRAR,I guess it’s how it was orig in the 70s
17-08-2020T00:24:53,CrRAR,They also have the Shaker ed with the hood intake
17-08-2020T00:25:13,Dadrobit,"I've taken a gander before and the intake behind the filter is pretty sizeable, a diamter big enough to get a fist in at least."
17-08-2020T00:25:57,CrRAR,Like an air box?
17-08-2020T00:26:03,Dadrobit,Aye
17-08-2020T00:26:30,CrRAR,Yeah those are always just big enough to be adequate for a small chipmunk family
17-08-2020T00:26:46,CrRAR,...or a single bachelor squirrel
17-08-2020T00:26:51,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-nibsbounce:
17-08-2020T00:27:32,Dadrobit,It kills me. You can see the damn thing from just opening the hood. Giant ass box. But the filter itself has to be removed through the side.
17-08-2020T00:28:07,CrRAR,I always question the path of the intake tubes they always snake like down out of view and then back yeah to the big OBVIOUS BOX thing
17-08-2020T00:28:34,CrRAR,It’s like “I’m pretty sure a straight line works BETTER”
17-08-2020T00:29:10,CrRAR,Yeah thats incredibly silly
17-08-2020T00:29:17,Dadrobit,"I just wanna take a sawzall to it, stick a cone filter or something on it in the gaping hole that's gonna be left, and call it a day."
17-08-2020T00:29:21,CrRAR,^
17-08-2020T00:29:46,CrRAR,There has to be mod vids on youtube by motorhead kiddies
17-08-2020T00:29:51,CrRAR,xD
17-08-2020T00:30:12,Dadrobit,100% there is. I've seen it.
17-08-2020T00:30:26,CrRAR,“So uhhh... this is my mom’s car... but today... we’re gonna pimp it OOOUUTTTT”
17-08-2020T00:30:33,Dadrobit,It's exactly as I described
17-08-2020T00:30:43,CrRAR,haha
17-08-2020T00:30:49,CrRAR,I believe it

17-08-2020T00:31:23,CrRAR,"Eh no harm, no foul, right?"
17-08-2020T00:31:31,CrRAR,More air = more better
17-08-2020T00:31:42,Dadrobit,"Of course, ""cold air"" is relative when ambient is 112."

17-08-2020T00:43:32,AspiringNoodle,The episodes are structured in such a way that it works really well for binging

17-08-2020T01:25:33,CrRAR,Like do they have a sub-human group of ghoul type humans in a basement somewhere for the one-ply?
17-08-2020T01:26:44,Dadrobit,We have a giant supply of one ply because the HOA bulk bought it after the toilet paper scare a few months back.

17-08-2020T02:59:13,AspiringNoodle,They are gonna have sooooooooo much back-pay to dish out...

17-08-2020T03:00:20,AspiringNoodle,"It's not so much a case of ""good luck getting a job"", more like places had a hard time hiring because unemployment was *that* good"
17-08-2020T03:00:32,CrRAR,Yeah
17-08-2020T03:00:42,AspiringNoodle,"And even if they lower the bonus payments, it'll still probably pay *way* more than you can get working full time at any place that's hiring"
17-08-2020T03:01:26,CrRAR,"Yeah, they gotta figure that out"
17-08-2020T03:01:27,Dadrobit,"It's not a problem that unemployment is good, it's that regular pay has become so bad that even unemployment is comparable."
17-08-2020T03:01:47,CrRAR,Yeah it no keep pace
17-08-2020T03:02:12,Dadrobit,"Also, unemployment fucking sucks right now. Even folks who are jumping through all the hoops are waiting months for assistance here in AZ."

17-08-2020T03:03:02,AspiringNoodle,That's what I mean

17-08-2020T03:04:56,Dadrobit,Some of the folks that work behind my gate got let go at the beginning of March and are now finally coming back to work. I keep hearing horror stories from them that they couldn't get a cent of assistance and barely survived til now.
17-08-2020T03:05:22,CrRAR,It does depend on the state
17-08-2020T03:05:47,AspiringNoodle,Yeah... government owes them for that entire period
17-08-2020T03:06:01,AspiringNoodle,"We cannot allow them to say, ""whoops, our bad"""

17-08-2020T03:06:44,CrRAR,I know here in MA there’s a pretty robust unemployment system already so they probably already had their ducks in a row
17-08-2020T03:06:45,AspiringNoodle,We must make sure the government pays out all dues...
17-08-2020T03:07:10,Dadrobit,"I'm hearing it's because the governor declared golf an ""essential business"" so they shouldn't have closed in the First place."
17-08-2020T03:07:14,AspiringNoodle,I wish those guys luck in getting the compensation they deserved
17-08-2020T03:07:30,CrRAR,But like NH is more of a quaint and less funded unemployment setup
17-08-2020T03:07:31,AspiringNoodle,"Also, fuck that guy right in the ass out into the middle of the desert -_-"
17-08-2020T03:07:54,AspiringNoodle,Piece of shit probably just wanted to keep golfing...

17-08-2020T03:09:27,CrRAR,Yup pure concentrated dumbass is popular these days
17-08-2020T03:09:41,Dadrobit,Blessing that we have governor term limits here and he's at the end of his.
17-08-2020T03:09:55,CrRAR,haha
17-08-2020T03:09:57,AspiringNoodle,It'll be fun when people spit on him when he's out of office
17-08-2020T03:10:16,CrRAR,Literally set their own traps
17-08-2020T03:10:25,Dadrobit,"No, he's still young. He'll probably run for Senate."
17-08-2020T03:10:41,CrRAR,haha
17-08-2020T03:10:45,CrRAR,Too true
17-08-2020T03:11:08,Dadrobit,That or he'll have a long career as a pundit on Fox.

17-08-2020T03:12:13,CrRAR,“expert”
17-08-2020T03:14:06,Dadrobit,"AZ has been purple for a long time. Once we get literal astronaut Mark Kelly into the Senate, depending on the candidates in 2022, AZ might go properly blue."
17-08-2020T03:14:29,Dadrobit,"We've had blue governors before, so it's not unthinkable."
17-08-2020T03:15:41,Dadrobit,So long as Ducey doesn't run against Sinema that is.
17-08-2020T03:17:28,CrRAR,"It is interesting how governors go, the two best ones in recent memory have been repubs. Romney and now Baker."
17-08-2020T03:17:52,CrRAR,Deval Patrick was pretty universally disliked
17-08-2020T03:18:09,CrRAR,I think he was democrat
17-08-2020T03:18:33,Dadrobit,It's a miracle we got Sinema in the first place. An openly bisexual atheist woman? In Arizona? It was a Christmas fucking miracle.
17-08-2020T03:18:48,Dadrobit,Democrat as well.

17-08-2020T03:19:39,CrRAR,Kinda like mayors
17-08-2020T03:19:49,Dadrobit,"Yeah, governors get overlooked in their power a lot because America focuses so much on Federal leaders."

17-08-2020T03:26:25,CrRAR,Yeah those looking for a leg up daddio not focusing on their current job are the bad ones
17-08-2020T03:26:29,CrRAR,Uhh
17-08-2020T03:26:41,CrRAR,Scott Brown was like that
17-08-2020T03:27:01,CrRAR,He campaigned as the average dude with a truck
17-08-2020T03:27:33,CrRAR,But he just disappeared afterward and moved up and up
17-08-2020T03:27:51,CrRAR,And now he’s the ambassador to New Zealand
17-08-2020T03:28:13,Dadrobit,"I don't get that kind of campaign. Don't show me why you're average. Show me why you're exceptional, show me why you're the best qualified!"
17-08-2020T03:28:21,CrRAR,Should probably ask unstedd how that’s going from that perspective xD
17-08-2020T03:28:32,Dadrobit,"Lol, indeed!"
17-08-2020T03:31:52,Dadrobit,"Then again, the ""exceptional person"" campaign has pitfalls. Then you get assholes like McSally who go full stolen valor claims like ""I was the first female fighter pilot!"""
17-08-2020T03:32:18,CrRAR,Yeah I feel like it’s all so subjective
17-08-2020T03:32:26,Dadrobit,"No, no you were not. Still doesn't stop her from blasting the airwaves with that claim."
17-08-2020T03:32:41,CrRAR,There are good actors and those that get misunderstood
17-08-2020T03:33:03,CrRAR,Or misrepresented
17-08-2020T03:33:28,CrRAR,I feel like it’s like that adage about stock picks
17-08-2020T03:33:53,CrRAR,That picking random is better than coming up with selections or a formula
17-08-2020T03:35:01,Dadrobit,"Ehhhhhh, I don't think random choice should be the methodology lol"
17-08-2020T03:35:32,CrRAR,lol true
17-08-2020T03:35:42,Dadrobit,Just wish I didn't have to fucking fact check my ballots so much.
17-08-2020T03:35:55,CrRAR,Yeah
17-08-2020T03:36:27,CrRAR,Like the building of a understanding of the people is too dang hard
17-08-2020T03:36:30,Dadrobit,My brother's methodology is to look at their Facebook and see how they react to being poked there.
17-08-2020T03:36:41,CrRAR,Yeah!
17-08-2020T03:36:58,CrRAR,Like if they listen or attempt to reach out
17-08-2020T03:37:13,CrRAR,Or act like robots
17-08-2020T03:37:16,Dadrobit,Honestly wish I'd have thought of that myself before I sent in my last ballot.
17-08-2020T03:37:27,CrRAR,Yeah
17-08-2020T03:38:16,CrRAR,That’s like how good mayors and governors operate by being available and listening
17-08-2020T03:38:18,Dadrobit,"We mostly ended up with the same choices at the end, but there was one I took on their history as a criminal defense lawyer that he disliked based on his response on Facebook."
17-08-2020T03:38:44,CrRAR,Mmmhm
17-08-2020T03:39:48,Dadrobit,But I'll definitely be implementing the FB check next time for local seats

17-08-2020T23:34:03,AspiringNoodle,"Oh yeah, before I forget"
17-08-2020T23:34:06,AspiringNoodle,RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAR
17-08-2020T23:39:33,CrRAR,I am currently watching :eye:eye:

17-08-2020T23:40:03,CrRAR,I dig the buddhist vibes

17-08-2020T23:40:49,CrRAR,Saitama's monolog about lack of emotion remanded me of Halo lore about AI
17-08-2020T23:41:10,CrRAR,"""No more sadness. No more anger. No more envy."""
17-08-2020T23:41:14,CrRAR,"""I have WON!"""
17-08-2020T23:41:52,CrRAR,Saitama is a very buddhist centered character in that he thrives in simple solutions.
17-08-2020T23:41:57,CrRAR,(one punch)
17-08-2020T23:42:14,CrRAR,...and that he just IS that and accepts it.
17-08-2020T23:43:25,CrRAR,There was this idea in Halo lore that AI can only persist for so ling before basically breaking down into an existential crisis of purpose.
17-08-2020T23:44:08,CrRAR,I think the established length of tie was 7 year lifespan for an AI.
17-08-2020T23:45:01,CrRAR,It just an interesting juxtaposition to Saitama's borebom with his profession
17-08-2020T23:47:36,CrRAR,Also is it me or does the Evolution Scientist guy remind you of a proto-Bondrewd?
17-08-2020T23:47:44,CrRAR,(from Made in Abyss)
17-08-2020T23:57:21,AspiringNoodle,Hold on
17-08-2020T23:57:50,AspiringNoodle,That series is on my backlog
17-08-2020T23:58:06,AspiringNoodle,I saw the movie version of the first half in theaters and now I want to watch the whole series
17-08-2020T23:58:40,CrRAR,"It's a good series, if a bit disturbing lol"
17-08-2020T23:59:03,CrRAR,The new movie is weird it takes some reflection to understand its message
17-08-2020T23:59:21,AspiringNoodle,I just find the whole concept fascinating
17-08-2020T23:59:33,AspiringNoodle,A mile-wide hole in the middle of an island in the ocean?
17-08-2020T23:59:43,AspiringNoodle,A hole so deep that it should defy physics
