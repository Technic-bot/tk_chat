24-04-2020T01:53:51,unsteddyphoenix,Youre gonna put the full fade-to-black scene behind a paywall on patreon right?
24-04-2020T01:54:06,SageSaga,"also its still sfw - because no nipples or other things are shown and no current ""acts"" are being performed"

24-04-2020T02:11:26,steelabjur,Only 11 past midnight here.
24-04-2020T02:11:42,SageSaga,ok- that afk was - i checked the IRS site and they finally recognized me as a citizen <_< so i had to fill it out and hopefully i'll get a direct deposit soon

24-04-2020T02:12:24,CrimsonHelsing,"imps are a step up from the posessed enemies (Basically zombies), but still low on the scale of demonic threats, can be easily killed with a shotgun, but throw fireballs and are dangerous up close with their claws."
24-04-2020T02:12:26,SageSaga,aso for when i go to sleep- it varies- lately 9am
24-04-2020T02:12:26,BadFoMo,Cool.
24-04-2020T02:12:41,johnnytho,woa

24-04-2020T02:12:48,BadFoMo,Varies for me too.
24-04-2020T02:13:06,SageSaga,i have several health conditions that make getting to sleep difficult
24-04-2020T02:13:17,CrimsonHelsing,"Hell Knights prefer leaping attacks to get in close to their foes, and hit harder with fiery fists and aoe attacks. basically towering walls of meat that'd tear a man in half"
24-04-2020T02:13:26,johnnytho,oh no
24-04-2020T02:14:16,SageSaga,but at least im not an insomniac - when i do get to sleep i usually sleep well
24-04-2020T02:14:29,Ordithus,:ptv-unimpressed:
24-04-2020T02:14:34,CrimsonHelsing,that's good at least
24-04-2020T02:14:38,johnnytho,"Thats good, i toss and turn alot"
24-04-2020T02:15:10,johnnytho,Hot where im at so sleep is even harder. Itll be 1am and still be 85 outside
24-04-2020T02:15:12,steelabjur,I used to have problems sleeping before I got my CPAP.
24-04-2020T02:15:39,SageSaga,the main issue with sleeping is the intense pain that no one can seem to do anything about that hurts for hours until it suddenly stops and i can pass out *nod nod*
24-04-2020T02:16:11,johnnytho,Hope we're not too distracting Sage.
24-04-2020T02:16:25,CrimsonHelsing,"like I said, not sure if these guardians are more comparable to imps than their bigger, more muscular and straightforward counterparts"
24-04-2020T02:16:26,SageSaga,im almost done
24-04-2020T02:16:28,unsteddyphoenix,How annoying
24-04-2020T02:16:40,SageSaga,i like chatting with chat while i work
24-04-2020T02:16:52,CrimsonHelsing,xD
24-04-2020T02:16:52,unsteddyphoenix,I just have pain free insomnia. Guess it could always be worse
24-04-2020T02:17:17,Ordithus,the pain is in the morning when I have to get up despite being so tired
24-04-2020T02:17:37,CrRAR,Existential pain?
24-04-2020T02:17:41,Ordithus,ye
24-04-2020T02:17:48,SageSaga,like i said- i dont have insomnia- i have pain that sometimes gets worse while trying to sleep- thus stopping me from sleeping

24-04-2020T02:17:52,CrimsonHelsing,yow

24-04-2020T02:18:31,Ordithus,"pain no good, go away, shoo"
24-04-2020T02:18:35,SageSaga,its like- imagine you are ready to sleep- and then- someone stabs you in the face with a soldering iron- probably not gonna just roll over and go to sleep - right?
24-04-2020T02:18:38,johnnytho,My backs been hurting more and more during quarantine. Have to work out my back or do something.
24-04-2020T02:18:52,BadFoMo,Dang!
24-04-2020T02:18:58,CrRAR,Fibromyalgia?
24-04-2020T02:19:01,Ordithus,uh is it actually that bad?!
24-04-2020T02:19:17,unsteddyphoenix,That's ...pretty dramatic comparison
24-04-2020T02:19:41,SageSaga,"i would rate the pain as a 8, 9 being ""ive been shot"" 10 being ""ghouls are tearing out my organs while im alive"""
24-04-2020T02:20:03,Ordithus,the 10 is unpleasant
24-04-2020T02:20:14,SageSaga,which is not like ghouls- they like to feast on dead things not living things
24-04-2020T02:20:37,unsteddyphoenix,9 is fine though

24-04-2020T02:20:58,eric190,suppose that depends on who's gouls you're talking about.
24-04-2020T02:21:07,SageSaga,the real problem with the pain is it can start- and not go away for 9 HOURS
24-04-2020T02:21:15,CrRAR,Feral ghouls xD
24-04-2020T02:21:35,CrRAR,Augh
24-04-2020T02:21:58,CrRAR,Is it fibromyalgia?
24-04-2020T02:22:13,SageSaga,no - and im not going to say what it is

24-04-2020T14:01:18,SageSaga,i ended up getting about 4 hours of sleep
24-04-2020T14:01:24,ZRO4825,I get to tune in and get sidetracked today for once! =D
24-04-2020T14:04:30,ZRO4825,"And oof, Sage. That sucks. I know how that feels. :("
24-04-2020T14:06:20,ZRO4825,"Ahhh, an anime classic song <3"
24-04-2020T14:11:03,Twokinds,Sage sleep more
24-04-2020T14:11:29,Ordithus,who needs sleep when you have caffeine
24-04-2020T14:11:38,SageSaga,i would have but as soon as i was feeling like i was drifting off- i got a sudden spike of pain and it lasted for 2 hours
24-04-2020T14:12:09,SageSaga,also i dont have caffeine- cant have it
24-04-2020T14:12:44,Ordithus,hmm so my perfect strategy has been shot down
24-04-2020T14:12:57,ZRO4825,Damn you biology!
24-04-2020T14:13:03,ZRO4825,Physiology? :thinking:
24-04-2020T14:13:10,ZRO4825,Something-ogy.
24-04-2020T14:13:47,Sclimshady,Scientology?
24-04-2020T14:13:56,Twokinds,Sleep after the stream
24-04-2020T14:14:32,ZRO4825,"Wait, that's illegal."
24-04-2020T14:14:51,SageSaga,after the stream i gotta cook dinner for the family
24-04-2020T14:14:59,Twokinds,Sleep after that
24-04-2020T14:15:13,SageSaga,thats D&D time
24-04-2020T14:15:29,Twokinds,That's okay
24-04-2020T14:15:52,SageSaga,. . . is this a ploy so you dont have to make your character?
24-04-2020T14:15:55,Ordithus,then sleep after that!
24-04-2020T14:16:03,Twokinds,Yes
24-04-2020T14:16:18,Twokinds,Then I don't have to be there and I'll be hugely relieved
24-04-2020T14:16:24,SageSaga,T_T Tom doesnt wanna play in my D&D games anymore T_T
24-04-2020T14:16:46,Ordithus,:cw0lfmare-Disappoint:
24-04-2020T14:16:55,ZRO4825,:csagesaga-nynastare:
24-04-2020T14:18:13,Twokinds,It's just the worst possible timing cause it happened to land on the end of the month right when I'm busiest with no break inbetween.
24-04-2020T14:18:40,Twokinds,It's killing me
24-04-2020T14:20:21,SageSaga,ok so you just need off tonight? I can postpone the game to next week
24-04-2020T14:21:21,SageSaga,that ok?
24-04-2020T14:21:23,Twokinds,"I know you don't want to postpone it. But if we play tonight, I will have to just roll a random character and be stuck with it."
24-04-2020T14:22:03,Twokinds,And I'll be inking during it >_<
24-04-2020T14:22:33,SageSaga,i get it man- i'll postpone for next week- i might have to take a nap anyways
24-04-2020T14:23:14,Twokinds,Thank you.
24-04-2020T14:24:03,Twokinds,"That makes it a lot easier on me. Sorry to have to hold everyone else up, though."
24-04-2020T14:24:53,ZRO4825,"Considering how much of your circle is artists or artists' besties, I'm pretty sure they understand. :P"
24-04-2020T14:25:55,SageSaga,dont worry about it
24-04-2020T14:26:17,ZRO4825,Who all DOES play with you guys anyway? If you don't mind my asking. :o
24-04-2020T14:26:49,SageSaga,"I DM, the players are Tom, Mihari, Fluff, and Silver"
24-04-2020T14:27:11,ZRO4825,"Okay, so I was right from what I remembered. Except Silver. Don't recognize that name I admit."
24-04-2020T14:28:04,SageSaga,Silver is a chill friend that ive been friends with for quite a few years- met him through my friends gaming group
24-04-2020T14:28:20,ZRO4825,ahhh
24-04-2020T14:30:46,SageSaga,his real name is Thomas too- i told yall i have many Tom Friends
24-04-2020T14:30:59,ZRO4825,lol
24-04-2020T14:31:12,ZRO4825,"So, wait, that makes Twokinds Tom, Silver Tom, and...wasn't Ninja Tom someone too?"
24-04-2020T14:31:18,SageSaga,yes
24-04-2020T14:31:25,SageSaga,there were 3 other Toms too
24-04-2020T14:31:32,Sclimshady,Soon there will be only Tom
24-04-2020T14:31:37,ZRO4825,oof. It's like my workplace and Mikes. We have 4 on the clock at once sometimes. :joy:
24-04-2020T14:31:52,SageSaga,lol just got a steam alert that one of the Tom's just launched a game
24-04-2020T14:31:59,ZRO4825,XD
24-04-2020T14:32:13,SageSaga,it was Ninja Tom
24-04-2020T14:32:40,ZRO4825,You need to set up a drum set with their faces. Put them on the tom-toms. :3
24-04-2020T14:35:55,Twokinds,:drum:
24-04-2020T14:36:05,TeapotOfDoom,hey kali tom sage! o/

24-04-2020T14:36:58,TeapotOfDoom,hi ord :ctwokinds-kingtea:
24-04-2020T14:37:32,ZRO4825,Heyyo Tea~
24-04-2020T14:37:50,TeapotOfDoom,i saw you were talking about dnd so i hopped in
24-04-2020T14:38:05,ZRO4825,lol
24-04-2020T14:38:45,TeapotOfDoom,in the midst of a game myself atm
24-04-2020T14:39:09,TeapotOfDoom,sage are you telling what setting you are working on now?
24-04-2020T14:39:48,SageSaga,they will be Isekai'd to Eberon
24-04-2020T14:40:03,TeapotOfDoom,uh isn't eberon the newest one?
24-04-2020T14:40:31,SageSaga,technically no
24-04-2020T14:41:42,TeapotOfDoom,do you know what books changelings are in? Because that took an abiility from my character that's why i thought
24-04-2020T14:41:53,TeapotOfDoom,i thought it was eberon
24-04-2020T14:42:06,SageSaga,Changelings are from Eberron
24-04-2020T14:42:27,SageSaga,Eberron was first introduced in 3.5
24-04-2020T14:43:31,TeapotOfDoom,ok interesting then i dunno. i had the ability to use my shapeshifting to scare people and wanted to use that last session and the ability was nowhere to be found
24-04-2020T14:44:50,SageSaga,i dont remember that being a thing for Changelings
24-04-2020T14:49:27,SageSaga,i had a similar ability in a Savage Worlds game where i took shape shifting- it was a post apocalyptic game- we took out a scout in the desert and his friends came looking for him and so i took his form and stumbled out to them and was like -
24-04-2020T14:49:55,SageSaga,"""Guys! Stay away! Something- Somethings wrong!"" and then i looked at the DM and said ""I make my face look like it's melting off"""
24-04-2020T14:51:01,SageSaga,i had taken the fear power... one of them clutched his heart and started foaming at the mouth as he had a heart attack and died- another just dropped to his knees covering his head screaming- and the other ran off into the desert
24-04-2020T14:51:36,TeapotOfDoom,i think you told me that story once xD i wonder if that would work in 5e
24-04-2020T14:51:38,ZRO4825,XD
24-04-2020T14:52:14,SageSaga,fear doesnt have a chance of instant death like it does in Savage Worlds
24-04-2020T14:52:23,TeapotOfDoom,dang
24-04-2020T14:52:31,ShamusTheFox,I like Savage Worlds. The Benny system is different and fun.
24-04-2020T14:52:36,SageSaga,but if you just take the fear spell you can work it in to your shapechanging
24-04-2020T14:52:46,TeapotOfDoom,uh nice trick
24-04-2020T14:52:52,TeapotOfDoom,i will remember that
24-04-2020T14:52:59,SageSaga,Savage Worlds is my go to for almost everything when i dont just want to run a D&D game
24-04-2020T14:53:34,Ordithus,it's been adapted to so many settings
24-04-2020T14:54:24,TeapotOfDoom,i took vicious mockery because it was very useful for Panic the Tiefling Bard in the Unexpectables but it was practically useless the one time i tried it with my Warlock
24-04-2020T14:54:32,ShamusTheFox,I like the Deadlands aesthetic. Wild West stuff.
24-04-2020T14:54:51,SageSaga,O_O oh no-
24-04-2020T14:55:00,SageSaga,uhhhhh
24-04-2020T14:55:08,Ordithus,eh?
24-04-2020T14:55:20,SageSaga,i think part of my tablets touch is broken
24-04-2020T14:55:33,TeapotOfDoom,whacha mean
24-04-2020T14:55:38,TeapotOfDoom,completely dead?
24-04-2020T14:55:57,SageSaga,my tablet is a touch screen tablet- so i use it to move my canvas around and zoom in
24-04-2020T14:56:14,Ordithus,restart? clean it?
24-04-2020T14:56:16,TeapotOfDoom,is the digitizer dead?
24-04-2020T14:56:34,SageSaga,im gonna restart the software
24-04-2020T14:59:35,SageSaga,that didnt fix it
24-04-2020T14:59:46,ZRO4825,D:
24-04-2020T14:59:52,TeapotOfDoom,have you pulled the power from the tablet
24-04-2020T15:00:02,TeapotOfDoom,even if that messes with the screen layout
24-04-2020T15:00:40,SageSaga,i'll have to do a full reset later - for now i gotta work around it
24-04-2020T15:00:58,TeapotOfDoom,is it just part of the screen?
24-04-2020T15:01:15,SageSaga,yeah the bottom right corner
24-04-2020T15:01:27,SageSaga,where i usually touch to move things around
24-04-2020T15:01:52,TeapotOfDoom,dang
24-04-2020T15:02:25,SageSaga,see thats so weird- it still has touch
24-04-2020T15:02:37,TeapotOfDoom,but the pen doesn't work?
24-04-2020T15:02:52,SageSaga,no pen works- the touch doesnt- all the time- herre
24-04-2020T15:03:35,SageSaga,im gonna move the screen from the red dot and move it down
24-04-2020T15:03:58,Ordithus,weird
24-04-2020T15:03:58,SageSaga,"it went all the way through the ""dead zone"" no problem"
24-04-2020T15:04:13,SageSaga,lets see if the blue dot works
24-04-2020T15:04:20,SageSaga,see?
24-04-2020T15:04:31,SageSaga,it stopped dead after less than an inch
24-04-2020T15:04:49,Ordithus,is the screen dirty at all?
24-04-2020T15:05:00,SageSaga,no way
24-04-2020T15:05:14,SageSaga,who could draw on a dirty surface?
24-04-2020T15:05:23,Ordithus,a madman
24-04-2020T15:06:17,RedDragonSyndicate,howdy
24-04-2020T15:06:31,SageSaga,yo Red
24-04-2020T15:06:39,TeapotOfDoom,o/
24-04-2020T15:09:14,SageSaga,i wonder if im going to need to replace this tablet T_T
24-04-2020T15:09:40,TeapotOfDoom,restart it then you'' know
24-04-2020T15:09:49,TeapotOfDoom,it's a wacom right?
24-04-2020T15:09:56,Ordithus,"now is not yet the time for panic, that can come later"
24-04-2020T15:10:09,TeapotOfDoom,^
24-04-2020T15:10:44,ZRO4825,Now is the perfect time to panic! O_O
24-04-2020T15:11:19,ShamusTheFox,"Ah, Toy Story"
24-04-2020T15:11:23,TeapotOfDoom,even if it really is dead wouldn't wacom be able to repair it? it's a business hardware nonetheless
24-04-2020T15:11:36,TeapotOfDoom,:cteapotofdoom-reni_rotate:
24-04-2020T15:11:58,SageSaga,it takes 2-4 weeks normally to have a tablet repaired by wacom
24-04-2020T15:12:31,TeapotOfDoom,dang that's quite some time
24-04-2020T15:12:49,Ordithus,please say you have a spare drawing tablet of some sort
24-04-2020T15:12:51,SageSaga,i cant just take a month off
24-04-2020T15:13:04,SageSaga,not one i can stream with
24-04-2020T15:15:28,Twokinds,Aw man D:
24-04-2020T15:16:57,TeapotOfDoom,wacom bamboo ftw xD
24-04-2020T15:17:33,SageSaga,and Wacom got rid of their cheaper Mobile Studio T_T
24-04-2020T15:17:50,SageSaga,2600USD is their only model now
24-04-2020T15:17:59,ZRO4825,Using an XP-Pen Artist 12 Pro myself. Seems pretty good. No touch function though that I'm aware of.
24-04-2020T15:18:03,TeapotOfDoom,2.6k wtf
24-04-2020T15:18:10,ZRO4825,Wacom prices! \'.'/
24-04-2020T15:18:15,SageSaga,3.5k for the 16 inch
24-04-2020T15:18:23,ZRO4825,O.o;;;
24-04-2020T15:18:25,TeapotOfDoom,:cteapotofdoom-katdead:
24-04-2020T15:18:37,ZRO4825,"Okay, I figured that much was for like, a 22 or 26 or something, holy fucknuggets."
24-04-2020T15:18:55,SageSaga,its a full mobile computer tablet though
24-04-2020T15:18:59,ZRO4825,Oh
24-04-2020T15:19:03,ZRO4825,"Okay, that would make sense."
24-04-2020T15:19:30,TeapotOfDoom,you mean it's a pc on it's own?
24-04-2020T15:19:46,TeapotOfDoom,still 3.6k for a tablet is a LOT
24-04-2020T15:19:48,SageSaga,i dont want to call it a PC- it's more like a laptop
24-04-2020T15:19:57,Twokinds,"Wouldn't it be a lot cheaper to get the 16"" Cintiq and hook it up"
24-04-2020T15:20:08,SageSaga,https://estore.wacom.com/en-US/screens/screens-pen-computers.html
24-04-2020T15:20:14,TeapotOfDoom,also wacom also sells their digitizers so i'd bet there are cheaper tablets using genuine wacom hardware
24-04-2020T15:20:24,SageSaga,yeah but i was looking at replacing my Companion eventually
24-04-2020T15:20:31,Twokinds,"It's not cheap, but more reasonable. Could be a stop gap."
24-04-2020T15:22:16,SageSaga,1.5k
24-04-2020T15:22:27,TeapotOfDoom,that sounds more like a screen
24-04-2020T15:22:34,SageSaga,it is
24-04-2020T15:22:57,TeapotOfDoom,still fucking expensive but 3.6k for a screen would have been a bit to much
24-04-2020T15:23:10,TeapotOfDoom,can you use the tablet version as a screen for another pc?
24-04-2020T15:23:21,SageSaga,T_T no express keys
24-04-2020T15:23:28,ZRO4825,XP-PEN has a 22R Pro only runs 'bout 700. But dunno how big you are on sticking to Wacom.
24-04-2020T15:23:33,TeapotOfDoom,express keys?
24-04-2020T15:23:46,SageSaga,buttons on the screen for macros
24-04-2020T15:23:50,SageSaga,i use them all the time
24-04-2020T15:23:53,TeapotOfDoom,oh makes sense
24-04-2020T15:24:00,SageSaga,not no the screen- on the tablet
24-04-2020T15:24:36,Twokinds,The expresskey remote is $100
24-04-2020T15:24:40,Twokinds,It's a piece of crap though
24-04-2020T15:24:45,TeapotOfDoom,wow
24-04-2020T15:25:01,TeapotOfDoom,that's a lot for a couple of buttons
24-04-2020T15:25:06,TeapotOfDoom,maybe use a streamdeck?
24-04-2020T15:25:39,SageSaga,streamdecks are over 100 bucks right?
24-04-2020T15:26:01,Twokinds,"I couldn't use a streamdeck anyway, I need the wheel."
24-04-2020T15:26:13,Twokinds,I change brush size constantly as part of my workflow.
24-04-2020T15:26:26,SageSaga,same
24-04-2020T15:26:48,TeapotOfDoom,you know about taran van hemert?
24-04-2020T15:27:14,SageSaga,the wacky doctor?
24-04-2020T15:27:35,ZRO4825,"Well, like I said, dunno if you're determined to stick to the Wacom stuff, but the XP-Pen tablets have a lot of the same options minus the touch for way cheaper. I'll stop pushing them, lol. I just see them as a good alternative in a pinch, personally."
24-04-2020T15:27:56,ZRO4825,"Touch might be a thing and I'm just dumb to it for all I know, but I don't think mine's reacted to touch at all. :joy:"
24-04-2020T15:27:59,TeapotOfDoom,no taran's the supervising editor of linus tech tips
24-04-2020T15:28:08,SageSaga,oh yeah
24-04-2020T15:28:10,SageSaga,hes crazy
24-04-2020T15:28:12,TeapotOfDoom,he's known for his makro stuff
24-04-2020T15:28:23,SageSaga,macros
24-04-2020T15:28:28,TeapotOfDoom,macro stuff
24-04-2020T15:28:45,TeapotOfDoom,sry german spelling
24-04-2020T15:28:57,SageSaga,yeah he has that crazy setup and had a thing with 3 trackballs on it
24-04-2020T15:29:03,TeapotOfDoom,even if it's still wrong i dunno
24-04-2020T15:29:31,TeapotOfDoom,that's a ripple tangient
24-04-2020T15:29:39,TeapotOfDoom,or however that's spelled
24-04-2020T15:30:19,SageSaga,Tangent Ripple panel
24-04-2020T15:30:26,TeapotOfDoom,yeah
24-04-2020T15:31:19,SageSaga,and Zro- it's hard going to anything else once you've used Wacom
24-04-2020T15:31:46,ZRO4825,I suppose so. I'm not experienced enough either in artistry or tablets to say the same.
24-04-2020T15:32:27,ZRO4825,I've just dealt with an Intuos Comic and my XP-Pen so far.
24-04-2020T15:33:10,TeapotOfDoom,i've tried a wacom once. it is really good
24-04-2020T15:42:53,SageSaga,brb
24-04-2020T15:46:54,SageSaga,back
24-04-2020T15:47:05,TeapotOfDoom,wb
24-04-2020T15:47:10,Ordithus,wb
24-04-2020T15:57:36,Ordithus,ugh my back.  forgot how much raking can hurt the day after
24-04-2020T15:58:30,Twokinds,"Raking, this time of year?"
24-04-2020T15:59:13,Ordithus,"pine cones, and stuff I didn't get to before the snow covered it all"
24-04-2020T15:59:26,Ordithus,"also, I still have some snow :P"
24-04-2020T16:00:03,Twokinds,whaaa
24-04-2020T16:00:54,Ordithus,a snowstorm in May isn't uncommon :cw0lfmare-Saltyember:
24-04-2020T16:01:04,Twokinds,We barely got any snow this winter.
24-04-2020T16:01:17,Ordithus,had entirely too much
24-04-2020T16:01:28,Ordithus,should have sent you some
24-04-2020T16:01:41,Twokinds,haha no thanks
24-04-2020T16:02:10,Ordithus,share the love~
24-04-2020T16:05:35,SageSaga,"=_= so i was supposed to cook dinner tonight, but my parents saw it was raining so they went out to pick up some food - and didnt get me anything"
24-04-2020T16:06:01,Ordithus,oi
24-04-2020T16:06:14,SageSaga,i would still cook in the rain btw... but i need to cook it all at once and I cant eat 10 hamburgers by myself
24-04-2020T16:06:47,SageSaga,i could probably manage 3 at most...
24-04-2020T16:09:40,Twokinds,Why do you need to cook it all at once?
24-04-2020T16:10:31,SageSaga,it's not going to last long- it generally starts to go bad after 4 days unless you freeze it- and it's a sin or something to freeze beef patties
24-04-2020T16:10:56,TeapotOfDoom,it is not
24-04-2020T16:11:03,SageSaga,pretty sure it is
24-04-2020T16:11:19,TeapotOfDoom,i've got beef in the freezer and it doesn't matter
24-04-2020T16:11:31,TeapotOfDoom,people freaking out about big chains freezing their beef
24-04-2020T16:11:39,TeapotOfDoom,as if that would be the problem at hand
24-04-2020T16:11:43,SageSaga,"""Thou shalt not freeze the meat of a cow, else it will not taste as good and you shall be as a failure is"""
24-04-2020T16:11:53,TeapotOfDoom,bs
24-04-2020T16:11:55,TeapotOfDoom,lies
24-04-2020T16:11:59,TeapotOfDoom,deception
24-04-2020T16:12:21,Ordithus,So that's what was on the third tablet
24-04-2020T16:12:26,SageSaga,yeah
24-04-2020T16:12:41,SageSaga,its the only part that was recoverable
24-04-2020T16:13:12,TeapotOfDoom,took me a while to get that joke
24-04-2020T16:13:23,TeapotOfDoom,:cteapotofdoom-lann_sceptic:
24-04-2020T16:13:35,SageSaga,but seriously- i hate cooking with frozen beef
24-04-2020T16:13:45,SageSaga,well-
24-04-2020T16:13:49,SageSaga,Frozen ground beef
24-04-2020T16:14:12,TeapotOfDoom,i mean you just have to let it sit until it's not frozen anymore
24-04-2020T16:14:24,SageSaga,that takes forever
24-04-2020T16:14:30,TeapotOfDoom,that is true
24-04-2020T16:14:39,TeapotOfDoom,just let it sit overnight
24-04-2020T16:14:40,SpazztasticKiwi,salt water
24-04-2020T16:14:52,TeapotOfDoom,or oven at 50C
24-04-2020T16:14:58,SageSaga,ive done the sit overnight thing- and it often turns brown and gross
24-04-2020T16:15:12,TeapotOfDoom,you have to wrap it
24-04-2020T16:15:12,Ordithus,"in the fridge, sage!"
24-04-2020T16:15:16,TeapotOfDoom,or that
24-04-2020T16:15:46,SageSaga,ive done in the fridge too and it stays mostly frozen even after 8+ hours
24-04-2020T16:15:57,Ordithus,"yeah, gotta plan the day ahead"
24-04-2020T16:16:09,TeapotOfDoom,that honestly didn't work for me that well either
24-04-2020T16:16:22,TeapotOfDoom,the trick is to wrap it and let it sit overnight
24-04-2020T16:16:32,SageSaga,the only time ive been ok with frozen ground beef is for making taco meat or chili meat because you cook it mostly through steam
24-04-2020T16:16:33,TeapotOfDoom,that way it can't turn brown
24-04-2020T16:16:54,SpazztasticKiwi,the turning brown is the myoglobin in the meat
24-04-2020T16:17:24,Ordithus,isn't most supermarket meet injected with co2 or something to help it keep red?
24-04-2020T16:17:32,TeapotOfDoom,^
24-04-2020T16:17:47,TeapotOfDoom,packaged meet is always in a protective atmosphere
24-04-2020T16:18:16,TeapotOfDoom,turns out normal atmosphere is pretty bad for food because of all the oxygen
24-04-2020T16:19:51,Ordithus,"anyways, make the burgers and stare your parents down while you enjoy delicious beef :ctwokinds-daydreamingkat::hamburger:"
24-04-2020T16:20:31,SageSaga,T_T im just  gonna wait and hope they dont go bad over night
24-04-2020T16:21:05,SageSaga,if they do i will wait to throw them away when they are around so they can watch me toss 10 uncooked burgers right into the trash
24-04-2020T16:22:41,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-LauraCry:
24-04-2020T16:22:59,SpazztasticKiwi,the blasphemy
24-04-2020T16:23:25,SageSaga,they say it's wasteful- yet they buy all this junkfood from fast food places with tons of wrappers and disposable cups
24-04-2020T16:23:33,Ordithus,this reminds me I need to acquire a grill
24-04-2020T16:24:31,SpazztasticKiwi,why‚Äôs everyone getting grills
24-04-2020T16:24:55,SpazztasticKiwi,grills sales have been going & even the guy I work with has been on getting one
24-04-2020T16:25:39,SpazztasticKiwi,"apparently he wants to cook pork chops for everyone - given the first few weeks with him, we were all on him to keep his hands washed, I‚Äôm not keen on that"
24-04-2020T16:25:58,TeapotOfDoom,i don't wanna say this now
24-04-2020T16:26:03,TeapotOfDoom,but we're grilling tomorrow
24-04-2020T16:26:13,Ordithus,but you just said it
24-04-2020T16:26:15,SpazztasticKiwi,another one!
24-04-2020T16:26:18,TeapotOfDoom,also you can just throw the patties into the freezer sage
24-04-2020T16:26:24,TeapotOfDoom,it won't hurt them
24-04-2020T16:26:31,SpazztasticKiwi,how
24-04-2020T16:26:35,SpazztasticKiwi,they‚Äôre already dead
24-04-2020T16:26:36,SageSaga,it wont hurt them- it will hurt me
24-04-2020T16:26:49,TeapotOfDoom,or the fridge if you intend to eat them in the next three days
24-04-2020T16:27:16,TeapotOfDoom,i ded ord. sue me :cteapotofdoom-florasmug:
24-04-2020T16:27:22,TeapotOfDoom,*did
24-04-2020T16:27:30,SpazztasticKiwi,you could wrap them in clingwrap to thaw and that‚Äô preserve them from touching the scary fridge air all night
24-04-2020T16:27:36,Ordithus,:csagesaga-nynasmirk: I can do worse
24-04-2020T16:27:37,SageSaga,i did intend to! Today! but now its been pushed back!
24-04-2020T16:27:48,TeapotOfDoom,what spazz said
24-04-2020T16:28:23,TeapotOfDoom,oh yea? come at me bro :cteapotofdoom-mrpopo:
24-04-2020T16:28:27,SageSaga,they will still freeze though
24-04-2020T16:28:37,Ordithus,let me go put some of my frozen chicken in the fridge to thaw for dinner tomorrow~
24-04-2020T16:28:40,SpazztasticKiwi,dude how cold is your fridge
24-04-2020T16:28:56,TeapotOfDoom,good question
24-04-2020T16:29:08,TeapotOfDoom,in any case don't let them sit out in the open
24-04-2020T16:29:15,SageSaga,oh you mean leave them in the fridge not put them in the freezer
24-04-2020T16:29:21,TeapotOfDoom,ye
24-04-2020T16:29:22,SageSaga,they are still packaged
24-04-2020T16:29:40,SpazztasticKiwi,how has this become so confuzzled
24-04-2020T16:29:47,TeapotOfDoom,works if you'll eat them in the next couple of days
24-04-2020T16:30:10,SageSaga,people keep telling me to freeze my meat and they dont get how annoying that is so i keep assuming people are telling me to do it anyways
24-04-2020T16:30:39,TeapotOfDoom,fridge works as well. not as long but it does help
24-04-2020T16:31:08,SpazztasticKiwi,well my first offer was salt water
24-04-2020T16:31:15,SageSaga,the problem is the burgers will go bad even in a fridge if left for too long
24-04-2020T16:31:21,TeapotOfDoom,ye
24-04-2020T16:31:30,Ordithus,well don't leave them in there for a week
24-04-2020T16:31:31,TeapotOfDoom,but you should be safe for three days or so
24-04-2020T16:31:32,SageSaga,im not gonna brine my burgers
24-04-2020T16:31:42,SageSaga,im saying today is day 3 T_T
24-04-2020T16:31:50,SpazztasticKiwi,"the day of, you can put them in a bowl of salt water and the salt can help thaw it"
24-04-2020T16:31:57,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-floAAA: time to panic
24-04-2020T16:32:11,SpazztasticKiwi,you can even maybe put them in bags with no air bubbles and the salt won‚Äôt touch it
24-04-2020T16:32:15,SageSaga,the whole point is- i dont know if they will be ok tomorrow XD
24-04-2020T16:32:27,SpazztasticKiwi,I know they use salt water to thaw steaks
24-04-2020T16:32:32,SageSaga,how will salt water help if its not touching it?
24-04-2020T16:32:41,TeapotOfDoom,is there a consume before date on there?
24-04-2020T16:32:55,SpazztasticKiwi,salt helps water sort of steal heat in a way
24-04-2020T16:33:01,TeapotOfDoom,?
24-04-2020T16:33:04,SageSaga,yeah but the dates can always be off by 1-2 days
24-04-2020T16:33:06,Ordithus,"it's fresh meat, only lasts a few days without freezing right away"
24-04-2020T16:33:31,Ordithus,"so cook burgers for you tonight, your folks can have leftovers"
24-04-2020T16:33:50,SageSaga,adding anything to water changes its freezing point
24-04-2020T16:34:12,SageSaga,its why salt water can be colder than 32F and not freeze
24-04-2020T16:34:18,Ordithus,"0F, in fact"
24-04-2020T16:34:18,SpazztasticKiwi,unless there‚Äôs a power outage or gremlins live in your fridge there can‚Äôt be a reason they won‚Äôt be ok wrapped in cling wrap or their packaging for the night
24-04-2020T16:34:29,TeapotOfDoom,^
24-04-2020T16:34:35,SageSaga,0F? i dont think so-
24-04-2020T16:34:45,Ordithus,freezing point of brine!
24-04-2020T16:34:50,Ordithus,It's part of what set the scale
24-04-2020T16:35:06,SageSaga,no
24-04-2020T16:35:18,SageSaga,salt water freezes at around 28F
24-04-2020T16:35:39,Ordithus,hmm so it has to be ammonium chloride
24-04-2020T16:35:49,SpazztasticKiwi,plain and salt water can also only freeze at top level too
24-04-2020T16:35:56,Ordithus,I don't think you want that near food
24-04-2020T16:36:29,SpazztasticKiwi,how about the thaw button on your microwave
24-04-2020T16:36:53,SageSaga,=_=
24-04-2020T16:37:10,SageSaga,using microwaves to thaw meat is bad
24-04-2020T16:37:27,TeapotOfDoom,at least now we know how to torture sage
24-04-2020T16:37:29,SageSaga,y'all cook right?
24-04-2020T16:37:31,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm just throwing out options here - the run around is starting to kill me
24-04-2020T16:37:31,TeapotOfDoom,ye
24-04-2020T16:37:42,Ordithus,my microwave is a timer :ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
24-04-2020T16:37:50,TeapotOfDoom,but i'd never use a microwave for that
24-04-2020T16:37:53,Ordithus,"and occasionally reheats chinese, or melts butter"
24-04-2020T16:37:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt cook with lots of meat meals
24-04-2020T16:37:59,TeapotOfDoom,that's just the last resort
24-04-2020T16:38:58,SageSaga,y'all need to understand- yes- you can freeze beef and then cook it later- however- it doesnt taste as good nor is it easier to work with as fresh beef
24-04-2020T16:39:32,SageSaga,if im gonna spend money on this stuff- i want it to taste the best it can- and that includes not freezing it and not thawing it with microwave radiation!
24-04-2020T16:39:35,TeapotOfDoom,i still disagree on the taste but yeah it's more work
24-04-2020T16:39:52,TeapotOfDoom,also microwave bad
24-04-2020T16:40:01,SpazztasticKiwi,well then we didn‚Äôt say freezer - we‚Äôve been debating the fridge option for over ten minutes
24-04-2020T16:40:12,TeapotOfDoom,^
24-04-2020T16:40:20,SageSaga,Perhaps your taste just isnt as refined as mine! *Tips hat and adjusts monocle*

24-04-2020T16:40:57,SpazztasticKiwi,sure Jan

24-04-2020T17:35:32,ZRO4825,"Just got back from dealing with family stuff, and wth o_O;;;"
24-04-2020T17:35:41,SageSaga,you can join us Tom

24-04-2020T17:38:42,Twokinds,Sigh...
24-04-2020T17:39:34,TeapotOfDoom,:cteapotofdoom-wolfstare: that sucks
24-04-2020T17:39:40,Twokinds,I wish everyone would just stay chill.
24-04-2020T17:44:06,Ordithus,:eyes:
24-04-2020T17:53:26,SageSaga,Lann was a pretty big part of keeping everyone together by socializing so its likely some people will drift a bit
24-04-2020T17:54:25,BadFoMo,Did he say why he was leaving?
24-04-2020T17:55:01,SageSaga,some of it im not comfortable discussing in public- but part of it was claiming he thinks he's addicted to video games
24-04-2020T17:55:59,BadFoMo,Thanks.
24-04-2020T17:57:11,SpazztasticKiwi,"I mean he‚Äôs working, schooling, likely keeping up with chores & hygiene...I wouldn‚Äôt call that addicted"
24-04-2020T17:57:25,SageSaga,yeah
24-04-2020T17:57:26,SpazztasticKiwi,I know someone who‚Äôs addicted
24-04-2020T17:57:33,SpazztasticKiwi,I live with her
24-04-2020T17:57:53,SageSaga,addiction is usually defined by how it affects your day to day life
24-04-2020T17:58:34,SageSaga,if you are missing work or school or other responsibilities over something it's likely an addiction
24-04-2020T17:58:56,Ordithus,pretty well lost a friend in college to vg addiction (f'in world of warcraft)
24-04-2020T17:58:58,SpazztasticKiwi,work has been cut for her since the ball dropped with the virus
24-04-2020T17:59:49,SpazztasticKiwi,"so it‚Äôs not missing work, rather with less work she‚Äôs on the games more, negating literally any chores aside from bagging trash once in a blue moon"
24-04-2020T18:00:11,SpazztasticKiwi,"but as much as I‚Äôd love to unpack my life‚Äôs suitcase, it‚Äôs not the time"
24-04-2020T18:13:31,ZRO4825,I guess I don't get it to an extent because that's just ALWAYS how I've been. :thinking:  I come home. I do what needs done. I play games.
24-04-2020T18:13:45,ZRO4825,That's just BEEN my life.
24-04-2020T18:14:17,SpazztasticKiwi,"chore days, I set up youtube and have at it"
24-04-2020T18:18:28,SageSaga,i need to set up a chore day
24-04-2020T18:18:49,SpazztasticKiwi,mine‚Äôs usually Sunday or Thursday
24-04-2020T18:20:02,SageSaga,"my mother was like ""With all this free time you should really clean up your room"" and i was like ""I dont have free time! All my work and day to day stuff hasnt changed other than a lack of toilet paper!"""
24-04-2020T18:20:13,BadFoMo,I just do what needs to be done when it needs to be done/when it starts to become a problem.
24-04-2020T18:20:39,ZRO4825,lol
24-04-2020T18:20:57,Ordithus,"yeah I'm still working full time.  No commute is nice, but that was only ~20 minutes a day"
24-04-2020T18:21:56,Sclimshady,"Literally nothing has changed for me except I no longer have school,  which really messes up my life schedule"
24-04-2020T18:22:12,Ordithus,free time moved from hanging out with friends to watching moar streams :eyes:
24-04-2020T18:22:31,ZRO4825,"Ain't shit changed for me tbh, except we've been busy as fuckin hell at work."
24-04-2020T18:23:01,SageSaga,"did yall see that meme about ""how people think digital art is made""?"
24-04-2020T18:23:14,ZRO4825,I have not.
24-04-2020T18:23:27,ZRO4825,I saw a video that Skidd did about it once though.
24-04-2020T18:23:33,Sclimshady,Im assuming they think the computer does all the work?
24-04-2020T18:23:59,TeapotOfDoom,it's like writing music
24-04-2020T18:24:11,TeapotOfDoom,press a button and the pc will do it for you
24-04-2020T18:24:18,BadFoMo,Is it the one where the person just throughs a pen at the pad and it just suddenly appers?
24-04-2020T18:24:27,TeapotOfDoom,(i hope my streams prove the opposite)
24-04-2020T18:24:53,TeapotOfDoom,(it took me fucking 10 years to get here)
24-04-2020T18:26:22,SageSaga,theres a lot of them but the most recent one i cant seem to find now T_T
24-04-2020T18:26:43,BadFoMo,Dang.
24-04-2020T18:27:03,SageSaga,i cant believe i didnt like it-
24-04-2020T18:29:03,TeapotOfDoom,how could you
24-04-2020T18:29:45,BadFoMo,"You're checking your History, right?"
24-04-2020T18:30:22,RimaDraws,hey

24-04-2020T18:33:56,SageSaga,yep just checked my history XD
24-04-2020T18:34:00,SageSaga,ty Rima
24-04-2020T18:34:10,RimaDraws,mhm
24-04-2020T18:34:23,TeapotOfDoom,tonight's stream is all about hindering sage in his quest to finish the page
24-04-2020T18:34:38,RimaDraws,usually he's done before 6 cst
24-04-2020T18:34:40,SageSaga,it doesnt matter- D&D is cancelled
24-04-2020T18:34:50,Ordithus,but dinner and nap
24-04-2020T18:34:55,RimaDraws,ah really?
24-04-2020T18:34:59,SageSaga,dinner was ALSO cancelled!
24-04-2020T18:35:05,TeapotOfDoom,that's why the challenge is to keep you streaming as long as possible
24-04-2020T18:35:12,ZRO4825,O.o;
24-04-2020T18:35:17,Ordithus,"You still are gonna eat, yeah?"
24-04-2020T18:35:23,ZRO4825,"DnD I know why, but dinner too? lol"
24-04-2020T18:35:50,SageSaga,because dinner was hamburgers but now those are for tomorrow if they survive the night
24-04-2020T18:36:57,ZRO4825,Well then.
24-04-2020T18:37:40,Ordithus,I'd be even more concerned if the burgers get up and walk away
24-04-2020T18:37:46,SageSaga,i had a snack set aside for D&D so i guess i can eat that for dinner
24-04-2020T18:38:07,RimaDraws,you need something proper to eat
24-04-2020T18:38:38,BadFoMo,Like Doritos!
24-04-2020T18:38:56,SageSaga,proper is overrated!
24-04-2020T18:39:01,RimaDraws,ok
24-04-2020T18:39:03,Ordithus,If sage can eat those despite everything
24-04-2020T18:39:07,ZRO4825,Not eating is even more overrated imo. :P
24-04-2020T18:39:25,SpazztasticKiwi,how dare you not eat a balanced meal
24-04-2020T18:39:35,SageSaga,i didnt say i was not going to eat anything
24-04-2020T18:39:44,SageSaga,but im also generally not feeling hungry
24-04-2020T18:39:46,Ordithus,"equal helpings of salt on one side and fat on the other, balanced!"
24-04-2020T18:41:12,SageSaga,well- you do need salt and fat isnt really bad for you-
24-04-2020T18:41:18,ZRO4825,Reminds me...need to go upstairs and see if dinner arrived yet. :joy:
24-04-2020T18:48:21,ZRO4825,Dinner had indeed arrived. However. I forgot Mom & d
24-04-2020T18:48:28,ZRO4825,Dad like to get like...everything on the pizza.

24-04-2020T18:51:44,ZRO4825,Onions are ick. ^^
24-04-2020T18:52:02,Ordithus,"you're just wrong, and that's okay"
24-04-2020T18:52:06,RimaDraws,i'd rather have olives and mushrooms on pizza than onions
24-04-2020T18:52:20,Sclimshady,BBQ chicken and onions
24-04-2020T18:52:23,BadFoMo,What about green peppers or black olives?

24-04-2020T19:04:47,SageSaga,one attacked me every year for almost every year of my life till i was 16

24-04-2020T19:07:19,TeapotOfDoom,it's usually pork but can be turkey as well
24-04-2020T19:07:21,SageSaga,nothing gets seasoning

24-04-2020T22:37:44,AspiringNoodle,I just don't give a flip anymore
24-04-2020T22:38:02,RimaDraws,why
24-04-2020T22:39:56,AspiringNoodle,"Came to work on Wednesday, coffee pots look dirty (yes, our self serve is up in ANY capacity if it's still profitable..."""
24-04-2020T22:40:27,AspiringNoodle,Found out that we ran out of the cleaner packets we use to clean everything some time between the last Saturday I worked and Wednesday
24-04-2020T22:40:38,AspiringNoodle,"Came in today, they all looked even worse, checked the drawers, no cleaner"
24-04-2020T22:41:20,AspiringNoodle,The walls on the inside of the pots are just completely stained with coffee
24-04-2020T22:41:33,AspiringNoodle,The glass tubes that show you how much coffee is in the pot are stained with coffee
24-04-2020T22:41:56,AspiringNoodle,"I'm like, ""There's a health risk here, right?"""
24-04-2020T22:42:09,AspiringNoodle,Because there's no way in hell those things are remotely clean.  Doesn't matter what you do.
24-04-2020T22:42:50,AspiringNoodle,"Combine this with all the other bs i've whined about over the past 2 months, and you can see why I just don't give a flip anymore"
24-04-2020T22:42:54,AspiringNoodle,This place is dead to me.
24-04-2020T22:44:36,RimaDraws,dang
24-04-2020T22:45:47,AspiringNoodle,"Also, found out why my manager forwarded both calls to VM today,  apparently he's off on the weekends"
24-04-2020T22:46:01,AspiringNoodle,"At least the AM picked up, she works both those days :D"
24-04-2020T22:46:24,AspiringNoodle,"And I only know this because I looked at the schedules for next week and the week after (this week's was already down, and he's off on the weekend both weeks."
24-04-2020T22:47:23,AspiringNoodle,"But yeah, that.  Old nemesis returned for a day, TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIEEEEEEEEES, OOOOOoOoOoOOooooOOooo"
24-04-2020T22:47:31,RimaDraws,mhm
24-04-2020T22:47:39,AspiringNoodle,And lack of manager / supervisor / key holder on shift
24-04-2020T22:47:51,AspiringNoodle,So all the funnest parts of the job rolled into one extra-long day.

24-04-2020T23:21:57,CrRAR,ellloo rima
24-04-2020T23:23:23,RimaDraws,how are you
24-04-2020T23:26:16,CrRAR,"Not very sleepy, so I‚Äôm back here I guess."
24-04-2020T23:26:36,RimaDraws,me too..
24-04-2020T23:33:58,CrRAR,"Haha, I was nearly dozing watching youtube earlier, went to brush teeth, now trying to sleep is impossible. Go figure."
24-04-2020T23:34:15,CrRAR,Curse you fresh minty insomnia!
24-04-2020T23:34:19,AspiringNoodle,if only our customers were so sleepy
24-04-2020T23:34:39,CrRAR,lol
24-04-2020T23:34:41,AspiringNoodle,it is MADDENING to see people take this thing so flippantly
24-04-2020T23:34:59,AspiringNoodle,When you see the same customers in day after day on stupid small things you KNOW are not necessities
24-04-2020T23:35:47,AspiringNoodle,"My biggest one is definitely lottery.  Especially when the heavy players buy, stick around to play them, then redeem winners and buy more.  And also when they do that multiple times in a single day."
24-04-2020T23:37:28,AspiringNoodle,"Btw, google US Covid cases"
24-04-2020T23:37:37,AspiringNoodle,Gives you a nice little timeline of new cases per day
24-04-2020T23:38:47,AspiringNoodle,"The 24th was a new record at 36,138 new cases in a day.  Curious to see how this plays out over the next few days"
24-04-2020T23:38:56,CrRAR,Yeahhh dicipline is not one of America‚Äôs strongsuits.
24-04-2020T23:39:01,AspiringNoodle,"We were doing a nice little rollercoaster ride for a bit, but now it seems to be climbing straight up."
24-04-2020T23:39:08,CrRAR,Yup
24-04-2020T23:39:21,AspiringNoodle,"Inb4 cases spike out of control and government locks down everything for 2 weeks, lol"
24-04-2020T23:39:31,AspiringNoodle,"Just get SUPER strict on what people can do, and when."
24-04-2020T23:39:54,CrRAR,People craving the mind-numbing monotony of routine
24-04-2020T23:39:58,AspiringNoodle,"It pisses me off because when I'm not at work, my ass is at home."
24-04-2020T23:40:13,AspiringNoodle,But I keep seeing people come to the gas station when it's obvious they're not working
24-04-2020T23:40:19,AspiringNoodle,And I'm starting to see more people bring kids in.
24-04-2020T23:40:37,AspiringNoodle,This lines up perfectly with an article I read earlier today about retailers being the new Disneyland
24-04-2020T23:40:44,AspiringNoodle,"People are ""shopping"" for entertainment."
24-04-2020T23:40:51,CrRAR,lol
24-04-2020T23:41:16,AspiringNoodle,There are only 3 ways this'll be resolved
24-04-2020T23:41:56,CrRAR,What‚Äôs saddest especially amoung the younger parent is that they‚Äôre openly admitting at this point they have no idea how to actually parent
24-04-2020T23:42:01,AspiringNoodle,"Either the CV was blown way out of proportion (fat chance), governments tighten the reigns once cases start exploding (likely), or workers protest and refuse to work while customers are so flippant."
24-04-2020T23:42:37,AspiringNoodle,That last one is possible.  Apparently there's a union of Target employees who are planning a mass call off on May 1
24-04-2020T23:43:14,CrRAR,"The way I see it is that if we were trying to prevent the worst, we already failed with it ravaging retirement homes it seems."
24-04-2020T23:43:35,AspiringNoodle,"People are going to retailers who are still open and sell nonessentials, like electronics, to browse.  And they're doing usual browsing stuff, which means lots of lifting and touching and zero heed to safety precautions."
24-04-2020T23:43:59,AspiringNoodle,hence why there's a potential mass call-off in the works a week from now.
24-04-2020T23:44:12,CrRAR,yup
24-04-2020T23:45:07,AspiringNoodle,To give you an idea of how stupid people are being.
24-04-2020T23:45:20,CrRAR,"Our response was too late to be doing as well as Germany or New Zealand and we‚Äôre trying to open aggressively, complete misstepping."
24-04-2020T23:45:22,AspiringNoodle,Some people seem offended if not irritated when they think our self serve is off limits at the gas station
24-04-2020T23:45:47,AspiringNoodle,"And I need to explain that the way things are working now, you can still obtain the stuff, you just HAVE to use a new, unused disposable store cup"
24-04-2020T23:45:51,AspiringNoodle,"No personals, no refills"
24-04-2020T23:46:09,CrRAR,You don‚Äôt get rewarded for reacting stupidly AMERICA xD
24-04-2020T23:46:22,AspiringNoodle,"But in reality, I would just love to say, ""Nope, all self-serve is shut down until further notice."""
24-04-2020T23:46:36,AspiringNoodle,"""If you think that's stupid, our competitors shut down theirs a month ago."""
24-04-2020T23:47:00,AspiringNoodle,"Oh, we get rewarded"
24-04-2020T23:47:04,AspiringNoodle,We just win the Darwin Award
24-04-2020T23:47:20,CrRAR,‚ÄúMy anger at that raises my body temperature high enough to kill ANY viruses!‚Äù
24-04-2020T23:47:20,AspiringNoodle,"Because 'Murica, don't you tell me what to f***ing do. *cough cough* I don't feel so good..."

24-04-2020T23:47:31,CrRAR,‚ÄúNow let me at that covfefe!!!‚Äù

24-04-2020T23:48:18,AspiringNoodle,"Btw, still really pissed off at my governor"
24-04-2020T23:48:32,CrRAR,*me
24-04-2020T23:48:42,AspiringNoodle,"They're being cowards and hiding behind ""But... but... muh lottery funds senior programs!"" to keep it open"
24-04-2020T23:49:24,AspiringNoodle,"And I'm like, ""Bullshit, most people playing the lottery ARE seniors.  Shut it down and redirect funds if it matters so damn much."""
24-04-2020T23:49:39,AspiringNoodle,"Which you think would be their course of action, considering we're one of the worst hit states with *checking*"
24-04-2020T23:49:55,AspiringNoodle,"40,049 as of April 24th"
24-04-2020T23:50:13,AspiringNoodle,"Oof, #6"
24-04-2020T23:50:44,CrRAR,"Yeah, within a week it‚Äôll become clear w/ Michigan. Alabama, and Georgia being more loosy goosy."
24-04-2020T23:51:03,AspiringNoodle,"California is tied with Illinois, that says something"
24-04-2020T23:51:13,AspiringNoodle,And we're ~1k behind Cali
24-04-2020T23:51:35,AspiringNoodle,12.8M vs 39.51M
24-04-2020T23:51:38,AspiringNoodle,Let that sink in...
24-04-2020T23:51:46,CrRAR,Cali was exposed so early too
24-04-2020T23:52:06,CrRAR,Wow

24-04-2020T23:54:01,CrRAR,Kaboosh!
24-04-2020T23:55:56,CrRAR,"Yeah, the fact the stats are what they are with responsible people being behaved is very troubling."
24-04-2020T23:56:42,CrRAR,I think the US as a society is just not public health conscious
24-04-2020T23:56:47,RimaDraws,too early to let people do what they want
24-04-2020T23:57:13,CrRAR,"Yeah, like we don‚Äôt get to tell IT what to do haha"
