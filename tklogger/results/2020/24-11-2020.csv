24-11-2020T00:16:11,Dadrobit,One of the chucklefucks on first shift. I guarantee it.
24-11-2020T00:16:55,CrRAR,I hope they have the decency to replace it fourfold
24-11-2020T00:17:35,CrRAR,a nice 4-pack sittin there a few day from now would be a pretty sight
24-11-2020T00:18:34,Dadrobit,"They literally JUST did it to the second shift guy last week. Like, wtf guys????"
24-11-2020T00:18:43,CrRAR,wow
24-11-2020T00:19:37,Dadrobit,I swear to God the morning shift is fukkin cursed to only be staffed with idiots.
24-11-2020T00:20:24,Dadrobit,They have the most complaints and the fastest turnaround by a huge margin.
24-11-2020T00:20:40,CrRAR,‚ÄúYou owe US the luxury of staying awake‚Äù
24-11-2020T00:20:44,Dadrobit,It's unreal how consistently terrible first shift people are.

24-11-2020T00:21:22,CrRAR,Wait like morning lik 8 and on or like super late to morning?
24-11-2020T00:21:40,Dadrobit,5am to 1pm.
24-11-2020T00:21:52,CrRAR,Ah I see
24-11-2020T00:21:59,Dadrobit,And 5 to 5 on the weekends.
24-11-2020T00:23:22,Dadrobit,Nightshift has actually been surprisingly solid for a few months now. Last guy I fired was the old racist fuck back in July. No problems since. Feels really good.
24-11-2020T00:24:54,Dadrobit,And the new guy I got happened to handle an incredibly serious situation really really fantastically. Got an extra $250 from the HOA as a bonus.
24-11-2020T00:25:17,Dadrobit,It was like only his third day too. Kudos to him.
24-11-2020T00:25:37,CrRAR,nice
24-11-2020T00:25:46,CrRAR,best foot forward
24-11-2020T00:27:10,Dadrobit,The community was in the news (for a good reason) and some random with mental issues used the information from the news article to get in and attempt a home invasion. Dude handled it like it was nothing.
24-11-2020T00:28:16,Dadrobit,Also a good lesson in not telling journalists anything that could even come close to personal information.
24-11-2020T01:05:43,SpazztasticKiwi,well I missed everything before:15
24-11-2020T01:07:37,Dadrobit,"If you saw me draw an angry note and bitch about fridge theft, then you're up to date."
24-11-2020T01:08:27,SpazztasticKiwi,yes but everything immediately after I don‚Äôt got
24-11-2020T01:08:57,Dadrobit,What's the first message you see?
24-11-2020T01:09:11,SpazztasticKiwi,"I asked question, went off on a game and back to this"
24-11-2020T01:09:19,SpazztasticKiwi,that‚Äôs a mad sheet of paper
24-11-2020T01:10:19,Dadrobit,Did you see my answer?
24-11-2020T01:11:06,SpazztasticKiwi,you asked what I last see
24-11-2020T01:11:09,SpazztasticKiwi,so nope
24-11-2020T01:12:49,Dadrobit,"You asked if I was a Lieutenant. I replied yes, that's the supervisor rank. Then CRAR mentioned it was a mad sheet of paper. Didn't miss anything else."
24-11-2020T01:14:13,SpazztasticKiwi,when I read ‚Äúmad sheet of paper‚Äù I thought https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/524825976597643265/781039943405142036/image0.jpg
24-11-2020T01:14:34,SpazztasticKiwi,immediately
24-11-2020T01:14:37,SpazztasticKiwi,why not just call it supervisor
24-11-2020T01:15:05,Dadrobit,Security loves it's bullshit paramilitary ideals.
24-11-2020T01:16:05,SpazztasticKiwi,why did I expect that kind of answer
24-11-2020T01:16:17,Dadrobit,Nobody actually refers to each other by rank unless somebody fucked up.
24-11-2020T01:16:39,Dadrobit,Or the sister supervisor (OIC) is around.
24-11-2020T01:17:03,SpazztasticKiwi,the work equivalent of mom calling you by your full name
24-11-2020T01:17:11,Dadrobit,Yep.
24-11-2020T01:17:35,Dadrobit,"Also, I don't get the reference you posted?"

24-11-2020T19:37:20,AspiringNoodle,"Think I found out why we're having so much trouble hiring... if you're being outpaid by MCDONALD'S, and you need a bunch of certifications and junk to work, it's a no brainer."

24-11-2020T21:41:00,SpazztasticKiwi,shaving for women is still up to the individual in modern times too
24-11-2020T21:42:58,SpazztasticKiwi,"if all you‚Äôve seen is smooth, you might not be the one that decided fun times were in the future"
24-11-2020T21:44:06,SpazztasticKiwi,girls work like that...unless they‚Äôre ones that just prefer a trip to the spa every two weeks for their own personal preference
24-11-2020T21:44:21,Ordithus,one does not always dress up as it were for yerself
24-11-2020T21:44:29,SpazztasticKiwi,exactly

24-11-2020T21:45:07,SpazztasticKiwi,well yeah there‚Äôs some that just like it better and others that do it for something like that
24-11-2020T21:46:52,Dadrobit,"And s'nice for myself being an otherwise hairy animal. Shaving keeps the ""bear"" comments away. Also helps show muscle definition without hair shadows in the way."
24-11-2020T21:47:34,Dadrobit,"(Procrastination over, leaving now, bbl)"
24-11-2020T21:47:40,Ordithus,ciao
24-11-2020T21:47:46,SpazztasticKiwi,"I know it‚Äôs more painful but if you want to thin the work, waxing can help weaken the hair"
24-11-2020T21:48:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"and so can plucking - I‚Äôve at least heard that those two can thin hair or stop it from growing back, but I‚Äôve tried plucking and it doesn‚Äôt ~seem~ to work"
24-11-2020T21:49:22,SpazztasticKiwi,hopefully this will be visible when you get back
24-11-2020T21:50:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"and yeah I know guys shave elsewhere too - bikers and of course male swimmers but also, why not if you like everything to be less than it‚Äôs natural  2 inches long"
