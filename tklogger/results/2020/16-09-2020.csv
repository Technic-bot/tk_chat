16-09-2020T17:15:04,SpazztasticKiwi,that would be a question to the two doing so in the parking lot rn

16-09-2020T17:15:36,AspiringNoodle,A car will flop onto whatever corner the missing tire is

16-09-2020T17:22:00,SpazztasticKiwi,it looks like that‚Äôs what the lady went back in the store for

16-09-2020T17:22:31,SpazztasticKiwi,this thing tiny
16-09-2020T17:22:55,CrRAR,"Yeah, they're a PITA."
16-09-2020T17:23:33,CrRAR,It's like undoing a twisty tie on a bag only if it was some type of hellish endless torture
16-09-2020T17:23:57,CrRAR,"Also, they should make sure the emergency brake is on in the car."
16-09-2020T17:24:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm just hoping they‚Äôre not gonna pump it up too high

16-09-2020T17:26:33,SpazztasticKiwi,right now they‚Äôre working on the rest of the bolts AFTER RELEASING THE LIFT
16-09-2020T17:26:59,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm going to keel over at this rate
16-09-2020T17:27:00,CrRAR,"It has to be down to get enough resistance to undo bolts, lots of tires will spin even if one wheel is still on the ground."
16-09-2020T17:27:31,CrRAR,Ya can't undo a bolt if the tire is trying to spin
16-09-2020T17:27:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I mean do they got it or not
16-09-2020T17:27:41,SpazztasticKiwi,that‚Äôs my question
16-09-2020T17:28:00,SpazztasticKiwi,because if a tires about to go flying I‚Äôm not sure I want to be this close
16-09-2020T17:28:10,CrRAR,lol
16-09-2020T17:28:29,SpazztasticKiwi,aaaand jacking it back up

16-09-2020T17:30:37,SpazztasticKiwi,kid just had me worried when he was working those bolts without a jack
16-09-2020T17:31:01,CrRAR,oh good
16-09-2020T17:31:25,CrRAR,yeah it's okay to loosen em with it touching the ground
16-09-2020T17:31:49,CrRAR,"Takes a lot of force, wheel will spin otherwise"
16-09-2020T17:32:50,SpazztasticKiwi,here‚Äôs hoping they tightened everything right
