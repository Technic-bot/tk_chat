28-03-2020T16:18:12,Roughlandin,It's almost like people improve their craft given 16 years of continuous hard work
28-03-2020T16:18:12,KeefMcDerpface,So chapter 13?
28-03-2020T16:18:17,TeapotOfDoom,how current
28-03-2020T16:18:19,IronHorseComics,"and he bitched about how there was ""no character development""  which indicates he didn't actually READ the comic"
28-03-2020T16:18:34,Glassan,Now THAT is obvious.
28-03-2020T16:18:37,Mediawatcher,He clearly didnt
28-03-2020T16:18:55,IronHorseComics,he didn't want to read it so he half-assed it
28-03-2020T16:18:55,TerraTheWizard,"yeah, from what people are saying his idea of character dev was looking at random pages expecting someone to have losst an eye"
28-03-2020T16:18:57,Mediawatcher,"These characters have changed so much throughout the years, even the sketches give some decent development for them"
28-03-2020T16:19:15,Roughlandin,Ehh. At this point I don't care about this guy's opinion. Probably just mad Tom is popular...
28-03-2020T16:19:17,longneccman,"I was reading one review of Slightly Damned where the guy first complained about the quality of art, and when Chu made improvements they complained about it not being consistent lmao"
28-03-2020T16:19:39,Mediawatcher,Heck two of these went from hating keidran to potentially having a crush on them
28-03-2020T16:19:42,TerraTheWizard,"he's a mildly popular ""storytime"" youtube furry"
28-03-2020T16:19:47,Mediawatcher,Two of these characters
28-03-2020T16:19:56,ProsePro7,Who said this?
28-03-2020T16:20:05,IronHorseComics,FurryFoofi
28-03-2020T16:20:17,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-rainehappy: backsies
28-03-2020T16:20:21,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,man this is looking so great
28-03-2020T16:20:21,SniperJackal,Oh no not that video
28-03-2020T16:20:22,KeefMcDerpface,wb Ord
28-03-2020T16:20:25,Glassan,Sounds like a troll whose opinions don't really matter. :P
28-03-2020T16:20:28,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,WB
28-03-2020T16:20:30,Mediawatcher,His video was barely even a minute
28-03-2020T16:20:32,Sammit,Wb Ord
28-03-2020T16:20:36,IronHorseComics,it was 3 minutes
28-03-2020T16:20:38,Mediawatcher,Hey ord
28-03-2020T16:20:40,ProsePro7,Tom was like 16 when he stared of course the old stuff aint as good as the new stuff.  My old writing from 15 years ago suck too
28-03-2020T16:20:50,ProsePro7,I'm a much better writer now
28-03-2020T16:21:01,Roughlandin,"Oh so he IS a furry. Furries causing drama because they're mad someone is better/more popular than them. Honestly, forget him. Don't feed the trolls, y'all/"
28-03-2020T16:21:03,TeapotOfDoom,3min to review tk?
28-03-2020T16:21:10,TeapotOfDoom,how's that supposed to work
28-03-2020T16:21:19,Glassan,Yes. And most 15-16 year old writing comes off worse than those that continue to work at it.
28-03-2020T16:21:22,IronHorseComics,it doesn't
28-03-2020T16:21:26,TeapotOfDoom,you can't even talk about the whole plot to this point in 3 min
28-03-2020T16:21:28,Roughlandin,That's like less than a second a page
28-03-2020T16:21:38,Roughlandin,waaaay less
28-03-2020T16:21:47,Glassan,Even Eragon saw substantial writing improvements as the series went on.
28-03-2020T16:22:10,Roughlandin,...Yeah the first book was basically A New Hope set in the LoTR universe...
28-03-2020T16:22:24,ProsePro7,The poor movie it got no love
28-03-2020T16:22:38,Glassan,"Nope, Just John Malkovich hamming it up."
28-03-2020T16:22:45,Roughlandin,Didn't help the movie butchered the plot so bad there was no way they could do a sequel
28-03-2020T16:23:27,AspiringNoodle,Is a shame
28-03-2020T16:23:34,AspiringNoodle,Wanted that movie series :c
28-03-2020T16:23:38,SwiftKitten,lol we talking about eragon
28-03-2020T16:23:49,ProsePro7,Set design was cheap too they didnt care just cashing in on the LoTR trend
28-03-2020T16:23:55,Roughlandin,Tis. Would have been better served as an HBO series like His Dark Materials
28-03-2020T16:23:59,KeefMcDerpface,We went from TK critics to Eragon. What's next?
28-03-2020T16:24:01,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-floraquestion: How much does Raine change form in REM sleep?
28-03-2020T16:24:09,SwiftKitten,it was a good book serties but yeah the onmly thing good wqith the movie was thespahria's voiuce and the scene with braum jumping in front of the spear
28-03-2020T16:24:15,TerraTheWizard,@ord yes
28-03-2020T16:24:23,Roughlandin,The answer is yes Ord
28-03-2020T16:24:25,Combak,Probably not much?
28-03-2020T16:24:52,SwiftKitten,oh did they ever make that series?
28-03-2020T16:25:07,Glassan,I had to agree with Nostalgia Critic on the movie being much better if Saphira just never spoke.
28-03-2020T16:25:07,SwiftKitten,his dark material
28-03-2020T16:25:11,SwiftKitten,i never saw it
28-03-2020T16:25:14,Roughlandin,His Dark Materials? Yeah. First season came out this year. It's pretty good
28-03-2020T16:25:24,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,Hi Swift
28-03-2020T16:25:29,Glassan,"All the communication would have been implied, and inherently come off deeper with how they emoted."
28-03-2020T16:25:33,SwiftKitten,hi dc
28-03-2020T16:25:45,Roughlandin,...Honestly the best part of the movie for me was Saphira... My first derg crush...
28-03-2020T16:25:53,Combak,XD
28-03-2020T16:25:58,KeefMcDerpface,And then Nora came.

28-03-2020T23:20:11,RimaDraws,LOL
28-03-2020T23:20:22,AspiringNoodle,Kids are literally the biggest assholes on the planet
28-03-2020T23:20:40,AspiringNoodle,The only reason they grow up into outstanding adults is because we punish their asses constantly
28-03-2020T23:21:10,AspiringNoodle,"Okay, we also praise them for good things"
28-03-2020T23:21:24,AspiringNoodle,"But mostly, ""If you hit anyone ever again I will WHOOP YOUR ASS SO HARD YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO SIT FOR A WEEK!"""
28-03-2020T23:21:32,Ordithus,Yeah no
28-03-2020T23:21:50,AspiringNoodle,"Oh wait, I'm thinking about parenting from half a century ago"
28-03-2020T23:22:46,AspiringNoodle,"In all seriousness, that's what kids do.  They test limits, more often than not going over the limit. Repeatedly.  Sometimes on purpose."
28-03-2020T23:23:19,AspiringNoodle,"For as smart as humans are, we're still animals.  We learn from good and bad results."
28-03-2020T23:23:50,AspiringNoodle,Gotta learn to conquer the ol' noodle brain :snake:
28-03-2020T23:24:41,BlackjackSec99,"or in my daughters case, ignores the limits because she has no concept of future consequences.... SEVERE ADHD case. zero impulse control."
28-03-2020T23:25:47,AspiringNoodle,"Oof, rip"
28-03-2020T23:26:29,BlackjackSec99,"yeah, shes 7. already got suspended from school for 3 days."
28-03-2020T23:26:44,BlackjackSec99,shes very suggestible
28-03-2020T23:27:05,BlackjackSec99,if her 'friends' think its a good idea she thinks its a GREAT idea and runs with it
28-03-2020T23:29:05,AspiringNoodle,"Is it me, or are autism spectrum disorders / ADD & ADHD becoming more common?\"
28-03-2020T23:29:15,BlackjackSec99,more diagnosed
28-03-2020T23:29:30,BlackjackSec99,20 years ago ADD wasent really a 'thing'
28-03-2020T23:29:46,BlackjackSec99,I know because I went through school being called lazy
28-03-2020T23:29:48,BlackjackSec99,no
28-03-2020T23:29:52,BlackjackSec99,I have ADHD
28-03-2020T23:30:03,BlackjackSec99,i wasent diagnosed till I was 22
28-03-2020T23:31:39,BlackjackSec99,autism used to be either  'retarded' or some other such depending on presentation on the specturm
28-03-2020T23:32:38,BlackjackSec99,"aspergers used to be ""oh shes just socially awkward"""
28-03-2020T23:32:57,AspiringNoodle,"Btw, want to make a point"
28-03-2020T23:33:02,BlackjackSec99,?
28-03-2020T23:33:05,AspiringNoodle,Worst name for a development disorder EVER XD
28-03-2020T23:33:10,BlackjackSec99,lol
28-03-2020T23:33:11,BlackjackSec99,yes
28-03-2020T23:33:22,BlackjackSec99,"agreed, but hey, that was the guys last name, soooo...."
28-03-2020T23:33:26,AspiringNoodle,South Park had a whole episode devoted to that bit
28-03-2020T23:33:37,AspiringNoodle,And it's still f*cking hilarious to me!
28-03-2020T23:33:41,BlackjackSec99,like the guy who invented the toilet
28-03-2020T23:33:46,BlackjackSec99,John C Crapper
28-03-2020T23:34:03,AspiringNoodle,...
28-03-2020T23:34:04,AspiringNoodle,LMAO

28-03-2020T23:34:40,BlackjackSec99,ok it was actuall Thomas Crapper... but still
28-03-2020T23:34:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I know of a kid with a learning disability
28-03-2020T23:34:50,SpazztasticKiwi,"my idea is, adapt but don’t baby then"
28-03-2020T23:35:35,SpazztasticKiwi,this kid was allowed to play on moms phone or a tablet whenever he wanted basically and threw fits if he didn’t get his way
28-03-2020T23:35:43,BlackjackSec99,"depends on the disability, really."
28-03-2020T23:35:50,SpazztasticKiwi,and he was generally allowed to get his way
28-03-2020T23:36:27,SpazztasticKiwi,"his hitting others was allowed to slide, as was breaking things"
28-03-2020T23:36:31,BlackjackSec99,some autistic react violently to negative stimuli and dont have any control over it.
28-03-2020T23:36:48,BlackjackSec99,^^
28-03-2020T23:36:59,SpazztasticKiwi,"he’s gotten much better but it’s because as he’s gotten older, they can’t afford to let him keep it up"
28-03-2020T23:37:01,AspiringNoodle,Interesting that we'd be having this discussion
28-03-2020T23:37:41,BlackjackSec99,"TK chat, where the discussion goes from furry butts, to mental health"
28-03-2020T23:37:42,SpazztasticKiwi,others were put in charge of cleaning his messes and his broken toys were replaced
28-03-2020T23:37:58,AspiringNoodle,"Well, it's because a week ago I stumbled upon an interesting reddit thread"
28-03-2020T23:38:12,AspiringNoodle,Week or two ago~
28-03-2020T23:38:34,BlackjackSec99,"yeah, kiwi, the violent ones are really hard to deal with and find ways to keep them calm, but diciplined"
28-03-2020T23:38:45,AspiringNoodle,"The thread was discussion abortion / euthanasia.  Among the things brought up, debilitating medical conditions and medical disorders"
28-03-2020T23:38:57,AspiringNoodle,mental disorders*
28-03-2020T23:39:19,AspiringNoodle,Some people on the autism spectrum are so prone to violence that they need to be kept in mental institutions for their entire lives
28-03-2020T23:39:43,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-RainezZz: night night
28-03-2020T23:39:47,AspiringNoodle,Night Ord
28-03-2020T23:39:50,SpazztasticKiwi,I didn’t like to be around them because of it
28-03-2020T23:39:55,AspiringNoodle,"Don't mind us weirdos and our ""wtf"" level chats :ptv-hearts:"
28-03-2020T23:40:14,BlackjackSec99,"i mean, if you take emotions out of it entirely, yeah, not having these drains on society for not properly functioning humans would be desireable, but...."
28-03-2020T23:40:17,BlackjackSec99,they are still people
28-03-2020T23:40:43,BlackjackSec99,"and the thinking of a non emotional machine is monsterous, and the source of many movie plots"
28-03-2020T23:41:00,AspiringNoodle,"Indeed, but I can tell I'm a CS major, lol"
28-03-2020T23:41:10,BlackjackSec99,night ord
28-03-2020T23:41:18,AspiringNoodle,You know what the biggest headaches are in programming?
28-03-2020T23:41:36,AspiringNoodle,"And yes, this is relevant :)"
28-03-2020T23:42:02,AspiringNoodle,"Go on, take a guess~"
28-03-2020T23:42:07,AspiringNoodle,I don't bite :snake:
28-03-2020T23:42:15,BlackjackSec99,*shrig*
28-03-2020T23:42:23,BlackjackSec99,*shrug*
28-03-2020T23:42:24,BlackjackSec99,**
28-03-2020T23:42:28,AspiringNoodle,Edge cases
28-03-2020T23:42:44,AspiringNoodle,Edge cases can eff up your entire program if you don't account for them
28-03-2020T23:43:01,BlackjackSec99,like grey area stuff?
28-03-2020T23:43:12,AspiringNoodle,"Or, stretching things to the theoretical limit"
28-03-2020T23:43:21,AspiringNoodle,"For example, the death penalty"
28-03-2020T23:43:40,AspiringNoodle,"I don't like it being used willy nilly, but there are cases where it's the best solution"
28-03-2020T23:43:41,RimaDraws,night night all
28-03-2020T23:43:46,AspiringNoodle,Night rima~
28-03-2020T23:43:46,BlackjackSec99,night rima!
28-03-2020T23:43:58,SonOfGoku,Night Rima
28-03-2020T23:44:41,AspiringNoodle,One of the reasons I can get behind the death penalty is that there are philosophers famous for being opposed to its use
28-03-2020T23:45:16,AspiringNoodle,"But ultimately concede that some people are so evil, and such a detriment to society, that offing them is the best solution"
28-03-2020T23:45:41,BlackjackSec99,"im opposed to it for one reason, what if they are wrongly convicted?"
28-03-2020T23:46:12,AspiringNoodle,And that's why my requirements are a bit stricter
28-03-2020T23:46:38,AspiringNoodle,"Too many cases of Person X killed Person Y, therefore death penalty"
28-03-2020T23:48:34,AspiringNoodle,Are you familiar with El Chapo?
28-03-2020T23:48:42,AspiringNoodle,"More particularly, the way he liked to kill people?"
28-03-2020T23:49:01,BlackjackSec99,"i know generally of him, but not details..."
28-03-2020T23:49:14,BlackjackSec99,brb
28-03-2020T23:49:19,AspiringNoodle,"He is particularly brutal.  In general Mexico's cartels are brutal, but he takes the cake"
28-03-2020T23:49:58,AspiringNoodle,"He had a fondness for breaking people's bones with sledgehammers.  If he wanted to kill someone painfully, he'd shove them in an oil barrel, have them doused with gasoline and burned alive."
28-03-2020T23:50:42,AspiringNoodle,The burning alive bit was actually his favorite method of execution
