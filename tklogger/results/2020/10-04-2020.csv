10-04-2020T12:08:53,CrimsonQuill,And Tom Crean too
10-04-2020T12:09:02,CrimsonQuill,Ever heard of Tom Crean?

10-04-2020T12:10:31,CrimsonQuill,"He went with two of Scott's expeditions, and one of Shackleton's."
10-04-2020T12:11:05,CrimsonQuill,He was one of the men who went with Shackleton to Elephant Island to seek rescue
10-04-2020T12:11:28,CrimsonQuill,He was a tough man. I saw an excellent play on him once in the theatre in Nenagh.

10-04-2020T12:24:24,CrimsonQuill,of other pencils
10-04-2020T12:24:28,JojoGD,It took forever to make the color palette
10-04-2020T12:24:57,JojoGD,I also got Fabre Castell but they are almost done

10-04-2020T12:38:00,CrimsonQuill,Really
10-04-2020T12:38:08,CrimsonQuill,If I were to complain about anything like that
10-04-2020T12:38:14,CrimsonQuill,I would line up the pros AND the cons
10-04-2020T12:38:29,CrimsonQuill,And qualify that this is not quite the majority
10-04-2020T12:38:38,JojoGD,The haters were being homophobic

10-04-2020T13:30:12,Twokinds,Since wednesdsay
10-04-2020T13:30:24,CrimsonQuill,Ouch
10-04-2020T13:30:33,CrimsonQuill,Was it cold?
10-04-2020T13:30:44,CrimsonQuill,Without heating and whatnot.
10-04-2020T13:30:50,CrimsonQuill,And how did you cook?
10-04-2020T13:31:02,Twokinds,There was a cold front that blew in with the bad weather
10-04-2020T13:31:31,Twokinds,"It was very nice, then got pretty cold, relatively speaking. It wasn't too bad, though."
10-04-2020T13:31:31,CrimsonQuill,Oh God!
10-04-2020T13:31:37,CrimsonQuill,Okay
10-04-2020T13:31:47,CrimsonQuill,"Umm, I hope there were blankets at least!"
10-04-2020T13:31:50,CrimsonQuill,What caused the cut?
10-04-2020T13:40:14,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-nibsbounce:
10-04-2020T13:48:17,ThoseButterflys,yeah
10-04-2020T13:51:42,ThoseButterflys,"frick i ment yay, but my english today is non existant"
10-04-2020T13:51:58,CrimsonQuill,Aheheh
10-04-2020T13:52:03,CrimsonQuill,It's fine
10-04-2020T13:52:13,CrimsonQuill,Because there are lots of English accents
10-04-2020T13:52:25,CrimsonQuill,One moment I can sound like I'm in Buckingham palace
10-04-2020T13:52:34,CrimsonQuill,The next I'm ranting as though I'm up North
10-04-2020T13:52:39,ThoseButterflys,I live in the most taxed state in america
10-04-2020T13:52:45,CrimsonQuill,OOF
10-04-2020T13:52:47,CrimsonQuill,Oh
10-04-2020T13:52:50,CrimsonQuill,Um
10-04-2020T13:52:52,CrimsonQuill,How bad?
10-04-2020T13:53:29,ThoseButterflys,Illinois bad....... Rain tax?
10-04-2020T13:53:36,CrimsonQuill,Um
10-04-2020T13:53:42,CrimsonQuill,What's a rain tax?
10-04-2020T13:53:45,CrimsonQuill,Wait
10-04-2020T13:53:53,CrimsonQuill,Am I missing something?
10-04-2020T13:54:18,ThoseButterflys,They tax you in the city by the square footage of your roof
10-04-2020T13:54:39,CrimsonQuill,WHY.
10-04-2020T13:54:40,ThoseButterflys,I live just outside of city limits though
10-04-2020T13:55:07,CrimsonQuill,"Well, lucky you...but...That tax...where's the bloody sense in it?"
10-04-2020T13:55:28,ThoseButterflys,Ask J.b. Pritsker
10-04-2020T13:56:07,CrimsonQuill,I don't know about US politic
10-04-2020T13:56:16,CrimsonQuill,I have to worry about the toffs at home
10-04-2020T13:56:40,ThoseButterflys,He will be the 3rd govener out of the past 4 we have had to be put in jail.
10-04-2020T13:57:02,KeefMcDerpface,Holy...
10-04-2020T13:57:06,CrimsonQuill,Your governers have been in Prison?
10-04-2020T13:57:18,CrimsonQuill,That bodes poorly
10-04-2020T13:57:35,ThoseButterflys,yep!
10-04-2020T13:58:08,ThoseButterflys,:grin:

10-04-2020T14:04:57,FoxxTrotter,:cfoxxtrotter-FoxEye:
10-04-2020T14:06:29,ThoseButterflys,"good afternoon DNMZ, and foxx"
10-04-2020T14:07:56,Dirbyn,Hi for all :-)
10-04-2020T14:08:21,FoxxTrotter,Ey'dere.
10-04-2020T14:10:22,Ordithus,Hello!
10-04-2020T14:10:49,jirka,Hmmmm Nina
10-04-2020T14:10:49,SageSaga,yo Ord
10-04-2020T14:11:10,SageSaga,who Nina?
10-04-2020T14:11:29,CrimsonQuill,"Well, I'm off-chapter 18 tonight"
10-04-2020T14:11:32,CrimsonQuill,Cya!
10-04-2020T14:11:42,Ordithus,bye quill
10-04-2020T14:11:43,SageSaga,take care Crim
10-04-2020T14:12:37,FoxxTrotter,"Bye, Crimson."
10-04-2020T14:13:52,jirka,Nyna hi hi sorry :ptv-sad:
10-04-2020T14:15:14,SageSaga,np XD
10-04-2020T14:16:46,SageSaga,this is the final page of Chapter 7
10-04-2020T14:17:13,Ordithus,I feel like these chapters just fly along
10-04-2020T14:17:50,SageSaga,each chapter is 26 pages like a standard US comic book
10-04-2020T14:19:09,BadFoMo,"Back. Also, there's a standard?"
10-04-2020T14:19:38,SageSaga,yep
10-04-2020T14:20:02,SageSaga,it's often padded out to look like 32 pages but thats because of ads
10-04-2020T14:22:38,Ordithus,Do you ever find that constraint limiting?
10-04-2020T14:23:50,SageSaga,nope- if a story portion doesnt fit you can always double the size to 52 and do a part 1 and part 2
10-04-2020T14:24:09,RimaDraws,hi
10-04-2020T14:24:14,SageSaga,yo Rima
10-04-2020T14:24:20,BadFoMo,Yo.
10-04-2020T14:24:26,Ordithus,Hi Rima
10-04-2020T14:24:30,RimaDraws,"hi sage, fomo, ord"
10-04-2020T14:24:44,FoxxTrotter,"Hi, Rima."
10-04-2020T14:24:48,RimaDraws,hi foxx
10-04-2020T14:25:07,SageSaga,sticking to a set number of pages per chapter makes it easier for determining printing costs and when i can make a new book
10-04-2020T14:25:54,SageSaga,it also helps to know if i have a script that seems way too big for 26 pages - it's probably bloated and could be cut down
10-04-2020T14:28:16,Ordithus,sometimes a constraint can be helpful!
10-04-2020T14:28:29,RimaDraws,that sounds good actually
10-04-2020T14:30:29,SageSaga,the next chapter has some big action scenes- i could spend probably 15 pages doing nothing but action scenes- but that would be way too long
10-04-2020T14:33:37,BadFoMo,"I'm torn on constraints. On the one hand they limit what you can do, but on the other hand they keep you from making something too crazy/random."
10-04-2020T14:34:14,ThoseButterflys,for me being new to these comics and streams its hrd to imagine that this is how comics are made
10-04-2020T14:34:33,ThoseButterflys,*hard*
10-04-2020T14:35:51,SageSaga,"hmmm, ive never really thought of it as hard- you just imagine a story- spend a lot of time tweaking the major details- write scripts- form the scripts into how ever many pages per chapter- then draw scripts"
10-04-2020T14:38:01,ThoseButterflys,I just meant like this is how they are made
10-04-2020T14:39:00,SageSaga,yeah but I dont get why? I mean- im not in a position to understand that because ive been doing this for over 16 years XD
10-04-2020T14:40:48,ThoseButterflys,I guess I just thought of them being done this way
10-04-2020T14:41:21,SageSaga,how did you think of them being done before?
10-04-2020T14:42:33,ThoseButterflys,i Never realy  put much thought in to it
10-04-2020T14:43:43,ThoseButterflys,I thought the comic was drawn on paper and colored and then copied into book format
10-04-2020T14:44:03,Ordithus,"Some artists do that, at least for the sketch and/or ink part"
10-04-2020T14:44:44,SageSaga,well most comic art is done fully digitally now- even in the past 15 years most coloring has been digital
10-04-2020T14:44:56,ThoseButterflys,I like this more though because you get that second set of eyes watching to catch anything or to just compliment
10-04-2020T14:45:31,Ordithus,Oh we rarely notice anything wrong haha
10-04-2020T14:45:39,SageSaga,XD
10-04-2020T14:45:39,Ordithus,Mihari will
10-04-2020T14:46:16,SageSaga,Mihari is my editor and web dev... and awesome friend :P
10-04-2020T14:46:29,ThoseButterflys,yeah i mean when you've done it for 16 years you practicly get it perfect
10-04-2020T14:46:29,SageSaga,Tom will help too sometimes
10-04-2020T14:46:49,ThoseButterflys,thats pretty cool
10-04-2020T14:46:50,SageSaga,nah i still make mistakes- especially typos!
10-04-2020T14:47:16,SageSaga,there are some words no matter how often i type them i type them wrong
10-04-2020T14:47:45,ThoseButterflys,google is your friend there for everyone
10-04-2020T14:48:01,SageSaga,google is not helpful for this
10-04-2020T14:48:15,ThoseButterflys,not drawing
10-04-2020T14:48:41,ThoseButterflys,the words
10-04-2020T14:49:05,SageSaga,wood you belief that sometimes your able to type things that goggles wont help with?
10-04-2020T14:49:35,ThoseButterflys,wah?
10-04-2020T14:49:52,SageSaga,it's an example :P
10-04-2020T14:49:54,Ordithus,Sage it burns
10-04-2020T14:50:05,Ordithus,my eyes
10-04-2020T14:50:24,SageSaga,if you type wood instead of would it's still a word- so spell check wont say it's wrong
10-04-2020T14:50:47,ThoseButterflys,yeah iguess I see now
10-04-2020T14:50:52,SageSaga,same thing with the wrong your instead of you're and belief instead of believe - and even google as goggles
10-04-2020T14:51:32,SageSaga,there's also this issue that people have. Where we see what we want to see rather than what is there
10-04-2020T14:52:01,ThoseButterflys,Sorry to bother you from your art
10-04-2020T14:52:13,ThoseButterflys,What comic
10-04-2020T14:52:34,SageSaga,i like talking about this stuff so its not a problem XD
10-04-2020T14:52:48,ThoseButterflys,Ok
10-04-2020T14:53:06,SageSaga,but yeah- people often see or read what they want rather than what is there
10-04-2020T14:53:09,SageSaga,for example-
10-04-2020T14:53:22,ThoseButterflys,Yeah
10-04-2020T14:53:47,SageSaga,"so if i have something saying ""He wouldn't believe me even he tried"" I left out ""If"" but every time i read it- my brain is going to put it in there because i know it should be"
10-04-2020T14:54:33,ThoseButterflys,god brb I dont feel very good at the moment
10-04-2020T14:54:37,SageSaga,np
10-04-2020T14:58:10,ThoseButterflys,"It might have been the chicken I threw in the crock pot, I cant remember if I washed my hands after touching the raw chicken"
10-04-2020T14:58:26,ThoseButterflys,:nauseated_face:
10-04-2020T14:58:35,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-zenshocked:
10-04-2020T15:01:58,SageSaga,i personally find it hard to believe that i would ever not wash my hands after handling raw chicken XD
10-04-2020T15:03:43,ThoseButterflys,I find it hard to beleive I would jump from a swing about 20 feet in the air but Ive done it
10-04-2020T15:04:09,ThoseButterflys,But I am a reckless 14 year old
10-04-2020T15:05:43,SageSaga,ha- i was going to quote a movie that came out before you were born...
10-04-2020T15:06:22,ThoseButterflys,so do it I might have known it
10-04-2020T15:06:40,ThoseButterflys,I am not the average child
10-04-2020T15:07:26,SageSaga,"""While you were still learning to spell your name! I was being trained to conquer galaxies!"" though i would replace that last bit with ""I was drawing catgirls!"""
10-04-2020T15:07:53,ThoseButterflys,Voltron?
10-04-2020T15:08:07,ThoseButterflys,If not I have no clue
10-04-2020T15:08:18,SageSaga,Battlefield Earth
10-04-2020T15:08:21,SageSaga,dont watch it
10-04-2020T15:08:28,Ordithus,Already ahead of you there :P
10-04-2020T15:08:31,ThoseButterflys,y not
10-04-2020T15:08:41,SageSaga,it's a terrible movie
10-04-2020T15:09:38,SageSaga,3% on Rotten Tomatoes XD
10-04-2020T15:09:40,ThoseButterflys,deppends on when it was made and if it is a sy-fy b rated movie I always get a kick out of those
10-04-2020T15:09:51,ThoseButterflys,haha
10-04-2020T15:09:58,ThoseButterflys,I look it up
10-04-2020T15:10:30,ThoseButterflys,omg they are midgets
10-04-2020T15:10:48,SageSaga,the aliens are giants
10-04-2020T15:12:38,ThoseButterflys,nope if there is a catagory worse than b rated it would probably be put there
10-04-2020T15:13:03,ThoseButterflys,nice shading so far though
10-04-2020T15:13:36,SageSaga,ty- but the movie was an A movie because it had big stars and a big budget for the time
10-04-2020T15:14:44,SageSaga,i mean it has John Travolta
10-04-2020T15:15:03,ThoseButterflys,wow suprising [typed with foot]
10-04-2020T15:15:40,SageSaga,so it's terrible for reasons that do not include a poor budget or bad actors XD
10-04-2020T15:16:23,SageSaga,"screenplay is bad, adaptation is bad, filmography is bad- effects were ok for the time-"
10-04-2020T15:17:34,SageSaga,"directing is terrible. I can imagine Travolta being like ""I felt like that line came off as very hammy- can we do that one again?"" ""Nope- it was perfect!"" ""Wait- really?"""
10-04-2020T15:18:37,ThoseButterflys,:laughing: ive seen face off I know for a fact
10-04-2020T15:19:46,SageSaga,Face Off- the movie where John Travolta does his best Nicolas Cage impression while Cage does his best- Cage impression......
10-04-2020T15:20:32,SageSaga,"""Nick- you're supposed to be John"" ""Yeah- but John is me now so im being him being me"""
10-04-2020T15:20:50,ThoseButterflys,lol
10-04-2020T15:24:08,ThoseButterflys,what comic is this
10-04-2020T15:24:24,SageSaga,https://www.artificialincident.com
10-04-2020T15:28:04,ThoseButterflys,you link other comics smart
10-04-2020T15:28:35,SageSaga,of course- they are friends
10-04-2020T15:29:02,ThoseButterflys,I dont see Tom linking yours
10-04-2020T15:29:13,SageSaga,he's linking my old comic
10-04-2020T15:29:19,ThoseButterflys,oh
10-04-2020T15:29:19,SageSaga,havent asked him to update and add AI
10-04-2020T15:29:28,SageSaga,Yosh! is my other comic
10-04-2020T15:29:31,SageSaga,i still update it too
10-04-2020T15:29:35,Ordithus,He needs to get on that lol
10-04-2020T15:30:00,Ordithus,Especially since you always encourage new-to-you readers to start with AI
10-04-2020T15:30:32,SageSaga,everyone gets scared of Yosh! and it's 2000+ pages
10-04-2020T15:32:21,ThoseButterflys,Haha I could read that in about 4-6 days I read The tokinds comic and cought up in 2 days
10-04-2020T15:33:16,SageSaga,AI is a lot cleaner and more current- Yosh goes back to a time of great weebness
10-04-2020T15:34:49,SageSaga,"it's like this- if you like the style, story and comedy of AI you would probably enjoy Yosh too"
10-04-2020T15:44:23,ThoseButterflys,let us bring up one more question. Xbox or Playstation or PC
10-04-2020T15:45:21,SageSaga,PC
10-04-2020T15:45:32,ThoseButterflys,Noice
10-04-2020T15:48:08,ThoseButterflys,my family wishes playstation and xbox could join up and creat a concole that could play the xbox forza games and have the user friendly style of playstation
10-04-2020T15:50:45,SageSaga,im not a fan of playstation for a simple reason
10-04-2020T15:51:46,CrRAR,the controller?
10-04-2020T15:51:57,SageSaga,because of Sony i have to wait a year to play FF7 Remake :P
10-04-2020T15:52:03,CrRAR,lol
10-04-2020T15:52:06,Ordithus,haha good reason
10-04-2020T15:52:26,Ordithus,I know what you mean.  I am not gonna buy a PS4 just to play that
10-04-2020T15:52:41,SageSaga,the funny part is- i own a PS4
10-04-2020T15:52:47,SageSaga,its sitting right next to me
10-04-2020T15:52:54,Ordithus,:csagesaga-philhuh:
10-04-2020T15:53:05,SageSaga,i bought it for MHW
10-04-2020T15:53:14,SageSaga,couldnt wait
10-04-2020T15:53:19,ThoseButterflys,mhw?
10-04-2020T15:53:25,SageSaga,but then Monster Hunter World
10-04-2020T15:53:36,SageSaga,but then was part of another statement XD
10-04-2020T15:53:52,ThoseButterflys,ok
10-04-2020T15:53:59,ThoseButterflys,i see
10-04-2020T15:54:07,SageSaga,so- But then it came out on PC finally and i realized just how inferior the PS4 Pro was and stopped using it all together
10-04-2020T15:54:19,SageSaga,i should sell it
10-04-2020T15:54:29,SageSaga,buuuuut-
10-04-2020T15:54:56,SageSaga,it's also my only bluray player now and i still have older blurays that arent on digital yet
10-04-2020T15:55:07,ThoseButterflys,sony and microsoft combined could beat pc or even get close
10-04-2020T15:55:34,SageSaga,not really
10-04-2020T15:55:50,SageSaga,it would also never happen
10-04-2020T15:56:21,CrRAR,"yeah, console hardware is just the result of cost/performance cost analysis, ""Gotta be advanced enough to impress people, but cheap enough to not lose us money"""
10-04-2020T15:56:44,Ordithus,And cheap enough for people to buy a specialty device
10-04-2020T15:56:56,Dakina,Yo
10-04-2020T15:57:05,RimaDraws,looks good sage
10-04-2020T15:57:07,Ordithus,Knowing in 4-5 years it'll be replaced
10-04-2020T15:57:07,SageSaga,"yeah when the PS5 and the new Xbox comes out its like ""Welcome to 5 years ago"""
10-04-2020T15:57:15,SageSaga,ty Rima
10-04-2020T15:57:17,CrRAR,haha
10-04-2020T15:57:25,CrRAR,indeed
10-04-2020T15:57:44,Ordithus,though my PC is at least 5 year old tech...
10-04-2020T15:57:55,Ordithus,And wasn't anything special
10-04-2020T15:58:07,CrRAR,yeah but that means a console from that era id like 10 years behind
10-04-2020T15:58:13,SageSaga,"""Through the power of Solid State Drive Technology-"" ""Dude- we've had that for years- your old hardware even supported it- i put an SSD in my Ps4!"""
10-04-2020T15:58:24,ThoseButterflys,Also knowing you could build a pc tower for the price of a console
10-04-2020T15:58:37,Ordithus,Not gonna be a great PC for gaming
10-04-2020T15:58:46,Ordithus,The console will probably be better
10-04-2020T15:58:50,RimaDraws,sorry i haven't chat much been looking at potential cosplay stuff
10-04-2020T15:58:53,SageSaga,yeah Consoles are cheaper
10-04-2020T15:58:58,SageSaga,np Rima
10-04-2020T15:59:07,ThoseButterflys,Sorry didnt mean pc
10-04-2020T15:59:09,Ordithus,"They're good bang for the buck, and they tend to just work"
10-04-2020T15:59:29,SageSaga,though games on PC are generally cheaper
10-04-2020T15:59:39,CrRAR,Is the next gen focusing on VR at all? That would sell consoles and reinvigorate the market with VR games.
10-04-2020T16:00:10,CrRAR,I find it laughable this past gen just pushed 4K and HDR improvements.
10-04-2020T16:00:56,SageSaga,consoles arent ready for VR
10-04-2020T16:01:18,CrRAR,"If we're another gen away from VR on consoles, consoles are probably doomed then."
10-04-2020T16:01:21,SageSaga,PC's barely are
10-04-2020T16:01:26,CrRAR,yeah true
10-04-2020T16:02:45,CrRAR,"If VR gains mainstream momentum with enough titles, people will flock to PCs for the advancement."
10-04-2020T16:03:33,CrRAR,"It's expensive, but the costs should come down at least a bit."
10-04-2020T16:03:34,SageSaga,"needs lighter headsets, better screens, better tracking, and lower cost"
10-04-2020T16:03:41,BadFoMo,I'm still waiting/wanting Matrix style VR.
10-04-2020T16:03:45,CrRAR,yeah
10-04-2020T16:03:49,Ordithus,mostly that last thing
10-04-2020T16:03:50,SageSaga,that is called Full Dive
10-04-2020T16:03:58,BadFoMo,Thanks.
10-04-2020T16:04:03,SageSaga,Full Dive VR
10-04-2020T16:04:56,BadFoMo,I have a short story about that. I really should write it.
10-04-2020T16:05:09,SageSaga,i would go into full dive VR to eat and drink all the stuff i cant anymore XD
10-04-2020T16:05:46,Ordithus,you'd sell out your revolution for pizza
10-04-2020T16:06:48,CrRAR,Tongue sensory clamp ENGAGE
10-04-2020T16:07:07,SageSaga,actually- you could eat IRL and then input whatever flavor you want into what you are eating
10-04-2020T16:07:51,SageSaga,Boiled Chicken breast becomes- Fried Chicken
10-04-2020T16:07:54,BadFoMo,Sipher: I know this steak isn't real; but my brain is telling me that it is juciy and delishus. ...Ignorance is bliss.
10-04-2020T16:08:05,CrRAR,Maybe it comes with a easy bake oven type thing that synthesizes tasty food pucks
10-04-2020T16:08:25,CrRAR,Boy the future is so promising
10-04-2020T16:08:56,SageSaga,Full Dive also opens up the possibility of living forever...
10-04-2020T16:09:22,Ordithus,"and strange, artificial, incidents"
10-04-2020T16:09:29,CrRAR,haha
10-04-2020T16:10:22,SageSaga,singularity event will change the world
10-04-2020T16:11:21,CrRAR,"Norman Reedus: ""Once there was an explosion..."""
10-04-2020T16:12:07,SageSaga,was Death Stranding about the Singularity?
10-04-2020T16:12:19,SageSaga,i never looked into what that game was about or how-
10-04-2020T16:14:31,CrRAR,"It is a large cataclysmic problem, very little explanation though."
10-04-2020T16:15:07,CrRAR,If you're familiar with the Silent Hill series where like a moral problem is sort of the source of the conflict it kinda goes that route.
10-04-2020T16:15:45,CrRAR,...but adds in more like political/corporate drama into it kinda like MGS
10-04-2020T16:16:00,SageSaga,Silent Hill was supernatural right?
10-04-2020T16:17:07,CrRAR,"Yeah, like in the original something bad happens to the Alyessa girl or whatever her name is and it splinters the world into two because it was a psychological trauma... Death Stranding kinda does the same thing."
10-04-2020T16:18:01,CrRAR,"Hence why the ""Death Stranding"" is leaking into the world."
10-04-2020T16:18:19,CrRAR,...but in the game it's explained in a very roundabout way.
10-04-2020T16:18:26,SageSaga,what is the death stranding?
10-04-2020T16:18:40,CrRAR,...and you're just delivering packages nonstop carrying a bb.
10-04-2020T16:18:41,SageSaga,an extradimentional force?
10-04-2020T16:19:01,CrRAR,"Uhh, it's like angry dead people."
10-04-2020T16:19:05,CrRAR,or something
10-04-2020T16:19:48,Werewing,So Hideo's version of zombies?
10-04-2020T16:20:10,SageSaga,sounds more like ghosts
10-04-2020T16:20:50,CrRAR,"Think kind of like in Dead Space enough necromorphs create a ""Resonance Cascade"" kinda like that, sort of just representative of those that have died yeah. The beasts in the game are just like more concentrated forms of dead things."
10-04-2020T16:21:38,SageSaga,and it was caused by some major experiment gone bad?
10-04-2020T16:22:06,CrRAR,"...and the living people just have to avoid the ""pools"" where they're concentrated"
10-04-2020T16:22:09,CrRAR,uhh
10-04-2020T16:23:22,CrRAR,It all spirals out of the one event that causes the world to fracture. Like there's this one person that did something that created a dimensional rift between life and the afterlife.
10-04-2020T16:25:11,SageSaga,so like- some guy opens a gateway to heaven- and it blows up and a bunch of people in heaven end up trapped on earth without bodies and form- and they get angry and merge and resonate causing a cascading effect?
10-04-2020T16:26:07,SageSaga,so now angry spirits live in pools of icky water
10-04-2020T16:26:49,CrRAR,"Yeah the whole game is about returning balance, the ""Death Stranding"" creates like anti-matter type properties when it reacts with living people which creates more of the destruction."
10-04-2020T16:26:59,Ordithus,page looks good :eyes:

10-04-2020T16:28:30,CrRAR,It just feels like so many details are arbitrarily tacked on to the games but you can get a good sense of the elements they were going for.

10-04-2020T18:16:24,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
10-04-2020T18:16:46,CrimsonHelsing,Good question
10-04-2020T18:16:54,ThingsAreMoving,If it's made entirely out of solid rock it would be heavy af
10-04-2020T18:16:57,CrRAR,I would think like almost unmovable
10-04-2020T18:17:38,ThingsAreMoving,Reni in her Dragon form would probably be able to topple it over
10-04-2020T18:17:47,ThingsAreMoving,"And Addie, obviously"
10-04-2020T18:17:47,K3IDRAN,Yas I made It
10-04-2020T18:17:55,ThingsAreMoving,o/ K3idran
10-04-2020T18:17:59,CrimsonHelsing,"You mean Jade, things xD"
10-04-2020T18:18:13,ThingsAreMoving,Jade 'King' Adelaide
10-04-2020T18:18:15,ThingsAreMoving,Yes
10-04-2020T18:18:33,ThingsAreMoving,I called her Addie before we learned her name and I'm sticking with it.

10-04-2020T18:21:00,BadFoMo,Cool.
10-04-2020T18:21:09,Ordithus,Could Jade arm wrestle him and win
10-04-2020T18:21:10,CrimsonHelsing,That *is* cool!
10-04-2020T18:21:20,Ordithus,These are the things we must know
10-04-2020T18:21:26,ThingsAreMoving,So more like some sort of non-newtonian rock fluid?
10-04-2020T18:21:31,CrRAR,maybe like a stop motion statue at 120fps
10-04-2020T18:21:36,ThingsAreMoving,That's dope
10-04-2020T18:21:52,CrRAR,Liqi-rock

10-04-2020T18:22:13,Ordithus,Magic!
10-04-2020T18:22:20,Twokinds,"If you punched him, it would hurt"
10-04-2020T18:22:23,Twokinds,Unless you were Adelaide
10-04-2020T18:22:24,BadFoMo,"That reminds me of an old image asking 'What if rocks are really soft, but they tense up when toushed?'."
10-04-2020T18:22:26,ThingsAreMoving,Him... or me?
10-04-2020T18:22:28,CrRAR,hahaha
10-04-2020T18:22:44,Twokinds,"But if you just pushed on him, it would give a little"

10-04-2020T18:22:56,CrimsonHelsing,"Looks and feels like stone, moves like flesh and bone. Clever"
10-04-2020T18:23:01,ThingsAreMoving,Non-newtonian rock fluid
10-04-2020T18:23:09,K3IDRAN,"@Twokinds yo Tom question Is It okay If  I use the name ""'Evals'' for my Halo Machinimas?"
10-04-2020T18:23:21,BadFoMo,@Twokinds Like Cornstarch and water?
10-04-2020T18:23:24,MoonDance,So like liquid cornstarch? but more solid.
10-04-2020T18:23:56,Twokinds,Yeah sorta
10-04-2020T18:24:03,Twokinds,if you could make the same thing happen with rock
10-04-2020T18:24:03,Ordithus,We already know his kicks hurt like being hit by a mountain
10-04-2020T18:24:04,CrimsonHelsing,Clever
10-04-2020T18:24:25,CrimsonHelsing,"Yeah, about as deadly as a hell knight"
10-04-2020T18:24:34,iliar,Liquid rock... yes. I know that feeling. Every day I touch liquid rocks.
10-04-2020T18:24:35,CrimsonHelsing,Cept no fireballs
10-04-2020T18:24:51,BadFoMo,@iliar ...Wat?
10-04-2020T18:24:54,ThingsAreMoving,So does that mean that it's actually a cat? Would It be able to squeeze through seemingly tiny spaces?
10-04-2020T18:25:46,ThingsAreMoving,o/ Iliar
10-04-2020T18:25:47,Twokinds,"No no, it's not the t1000"
10-04-2020T18:25:54,CrRAR,haha
10-04-2020T18:25:55,Twokinds,He's not actually liquid
10-04-2020T18:26:11,Ordithus,"He's rock, but magic"
10-04-2020T18:26:12,ThingsAreMoving,That's good.
10-04-2020T18:26:27,CrimsonHelsing,"Methinks he can interact with anything in the world like a being of flesh and bone, thanks to the enchantment placed upon him"
10-04-2020T18:26:39,K3IDRAN,Hasga la vista baby
10-04-2020T18:26:44,K3IDRAN,Hasta
10-04-2020T18:27:00,Ordithus,"Rock or no, he's got a big <3 for his master"
10-04-2020T18:27:00,iliar,"That was the irony. The description ""liquid rock"" does not help if you have never touched liquid rocks."
10-04-2020T18:27:33,ThingsAreMoving,I have never experienced touching magma
10-04-2020T18:27:36,Twokinds,"Yeah, I know. It's magic, so it's an impossible thing, rock that moves fluidly without being liquid."
10-04-2020T18:28:01,MoonDance,Magma is the closest thing to liquid rock- but that'll hurt more than punching it's back
10-04-2020T18:28:11,Ordithus,Magic sure would making construction easier
10-04-2020T18:28:15,CrimsonHelsing,So like flesh? Or scales?
10-04-2020T18:28:29,CrRAR,"wow, nice"
10-04-2020T18:28:29,K3IDRAN,@twokinds  tom? what would the chapters be like If Mike stayed Female?

10-04-2020T18:29:32,ThingsAreMoving,"Cause damn you have lots of Lore, good sir."
10-04-2020T18:29:35,MoonDance,His texture reminds me of smooth granit

10-04-2020T23:38:59,JojoGD,Hello
10-04-2020T23:39:18,SonOfGoku,Hi Jojo
10-04-2020T23:39:28,JojoGD,Was there a stream today?
10-04-2020T23:40:25,SonOfGoku,There was but it was short
10-04-2020T23:40:49,JojoGD,Oh dam I missed it
10-04-2020T23:41:11,JojoGD,I was helping fixing the chicken pen
10-04-2020T23:41:14,SpazztasticKiwi,condoms are being deemed essential too
10-04-2020T23:41:20,AspiringNoodle,LOL

10-04-2020T23:52:14,JojoGD,Hi noodle
10-04-2020T23:52:45,AspiringNoodle,Hi~
10-04-2020T23:52:55,AspiringNoodle,I'm starting to get hyped over shadowlands
10-04-2020T23:53:06,AspiringNoodle,Don't know whether to be worried or excited :ptv-excited:
10-04-2020T23:53:28,SonOfGoku,I would be worried
10-04-2020T23:53:50,JojoGD,I getting slightly better at the ending of clubstep
10-04-2020T23:54:24,AspiringNoodle,"Well, part of the reason I'm unsure is that Blizzard is taking like 50 steps back"
10-04-2020T23:54:40,AspiringNoodle,The players have seemingly won the fight against their skinner box loot system
10-04-2020T23:56:01,AspiringNoodle,"BFA has so much stuff to do that's on a timegated basis where if you don't do it daily, you will lose a lot of progress"
10-04-2020T23:56:47,AspiringNoodle,"In earlier expansions, you could just log in for raid every week, and then suddenly decide, ""Hey, I feel like dumping an entire week into this game."" And you could progress at your own pace"
10-04-2020T23:56:57,JojoGD,Should I post a link to a video of clubstep so you all can know what I’m talking about
10-04-2020T23:57:16,AspiringNoodle,One second...
