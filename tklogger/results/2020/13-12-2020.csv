13-12-2020T16:11:17,SpazztasticKiwi,why don‚Äôt we have that newspaper wap emote anymore
13-12-2020T16:12:09,SpazztasticKiwi,& I either missed the vote for when I won yesterday or Tom picked it
13-12-2020T16:12:49,CrimsonQuill,"Wow, which suggestion was yours Spazz? I missed the stream."
13-12-2020T16:36:11,CrRAR,The Trace/Flora family holiday picture pose
13-12-2020T16:36:59,CrRAR,It was a pick

13-12-2020T16:38:27,CrimsonQuill,Oh lovely!
13-12-2020T16:38:32,CrimsonQuill,What were the others?
13-12-2020T16:59:54,Folfy,Flora got tangled in a bunch of Christmas lights. That one was Ord's I believe
13-12-2020T17:05:13,CrimsonQuill,"Aww, poor kitty"

13-12-2020T17:07:48,CrRAR,Pizza run
13-12-2020T17:21:49,CrimsonQuill,"Ooh, there's a pizza place near my residence."
13-12-2020T17:22:03,CrimsonQuill,Wood Fired.
13-12-2020T17:22:10,CrimsonQuill,"Don't use it often though,."
13-12-2020T17:40:22,tehbear,my parents used to make homemade panpizza every week
13-12-2020T17:40:48,tehbear,i think it must be half a decade since i made homemade pizza... bout time to take a break from the frozen ones
13-12-2020T17:41:22,tehbear,"pizza is always good, even when its bad"
13-12-2020T17:44:39,CrRAR,wood fired brick oven is the best
13-12-2020T17:44:51,CrRAR,"Smoky, thincrust, crunchy"
13-12-2020T17:45:11,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-renirar::pizza:
13-12-2020T17:51:28,tehbear,*dragonfired brick oven is best
13-12-2020T18:17:42,CrimsonQuill,Delicious...
13-12-2020T18:17:49,CrimsonQuill,"Anyhow, night guys!"
13-12-2020T18:20:24,SonOfGoku,Night Quill
13-12-2020T18:24:49,SpazztasticKiwi,now I have what I‚Äôm getting for dinner when I‚Äôm off
13-12-2020T18:44:43,CrRAR,whacha'get?

13-12-2020T19:10:02,CrRAR,how'd the work week start?
13-12-2020T19:10:17,Ordithus,"not a great start, but got better as the day went on"
13-12-2020T19:10:36,Ordithus,almost... done... with this test report
13-12-2020T19:10:56,CrRAR,nice
13-12-2020T19:10:59,Ordithus,how you doin'
13-12-2020T19:12:00,CrRAR,"good, worked through stuff started last week things make more sense now."
13-12-2020T19:12:15,CrRAR,Great when one day resolves so many questions
13-12-2020T19:12:21,Ordithus,nice nice
13-12-2020T19:13:43,CrRAR,bar any disasters should be able to coast into Christmas week
13-12-2020T19:13:56,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-daydreamingkat:
13-12-2020T19:14:16,Ordithus,yee looking forward to some time off
13-12-2020T19:14:38,Ordithus,even though I'll miss seeing family
13-12-2020T19:15:37,CrRAR,"yeah, much more quiet, usually chinese food and bigish get togethers"
13-12-2020T19:17:35,Ordithus,hope to at least spend some time with a couple friends
13-12-2020T19:17:57,Ordithus,"I have not seen any friends since october, family since august"
13-12-2020T19:18:18,Ordithus,c'mon vaccine get in my blooood
13-12-2020T19:27:08,CrRAR,Once the high risk groups are taken care of I think the stigma will kinda vanish
13-12-2020T19:27:49,CrRAR,the deceiving part seems to be is this first one seems like a stopgap because of how damn delicate it is
13-12-2020T19:27:59,CrRAR,like temperature keeping wise
13-12-2020T19:28:31,CrRAR,The moderns one doesn't have to be so severely climate controlled
13-12-2020T19:28:40,CrRAR,*moderna
13-12-2020T19:30:15,Ordithus,"yeah, it'll be interesting to see how the distribution goes"
13-12-2020T19:30:24,Ordithus,I don't think there will have been anything like it

13-12-2020T19:34:22,Ordithus,mRNA is fascinating
13-12-2020T19:35:23,CrRAR,yeap like a teensy little rogue executable script
13-12-2020T19:36:08,Ordithus,just enough to build part of the virus instead of the virus building the whole thing and causing chaos
13-12-2020T19:36:36,CrRAR,"body: ""tf is this?"""
13-12-2020T19:36:56,CrRAR,"""hey, HEY, which onea you made this!?"""
13-12-2020T19:40:20,Ordithus,I read that mRNA treatments were originally tried out as a sort of vaccine against cancer
13-12-2020T19:40:52,Ordithus,an established tech just looking for the right application
13-12-2020T19:41:46,CrRAR,"yeah, I suppose like... targeted?"
13-12-2020T19:42:34,CrRAR,Was the hope to plant slime sort of foreign mRNA so the body turned on the cancer cell?
13-12-2020T19:42:40,CrRAR,*some
13-12-2020T19:43:29,Ordithus,"I believe there are a few proteins that certain cancer cells tend to make, and can be used as a marker"
13-12-2020T19:43:59,Ordithus,but I'm talking on a subject I don't know much about
13-12-2020T19:45:41,CrRAR,"Yeah, just like the immune system seeks out the protein that the mRNA signals for"
13-12-2020T19:46:28,CrRAR,"If you could plant mRNA in cancer cells to produce a ""hostile"" protein the immune system would attack it I guess"
13-12-2020T19:47:11,CrRAR,So the body would take care of the cancer itself
13-12-2020T19:47:49,CrRAR,The problem is that I'm guessing most operations the cancer cells do on their own the body just views as fine.
13-12-2020T19:48:57,CrRAR,or somehow teach the body a similar marker to what the protein the cancer cells already have
13-12-2020T19:49:56,CrRAR,"it's dangerous though, cuz if you try to teach the immune system something to similar to something healthy you run the risk of starting some sort of autoimmune disorder"
13-12-2020T19:50:06,CrRAR,*too similar
13-12-2020T19:50:40,Ordithus,and that would not be good
13-12-2020T19:51:33,CrRAR,"yeah, tricky science"
