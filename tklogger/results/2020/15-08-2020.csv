15-08-2020T00:32:26,SpazztasticKiwi,to get a date? sure - but where he at tho
15-08-2020T00:34:16,CrRAR,a great mystery I guess
15-08-2020T00:35:18,SpazztasticKiwi,probably caught in a tree somewhere
15-08-2020T00:37:55,CrRAR,sounds like a rescue is in order
15-08-2020T00:42:37,CrRAR,how big of a net do you reckon we'd need?
15-08-2020T00:45:02,JojoGD,I had fun playing monopoly today with some friends
15-08-2020T00:48:38,CrRAR,it gets villainous pretty quickly
15-08-2020T01:11:03,SpazztasticKiwi,I want a guy with a few things on his resume
15-08-2020T01:11:39,AspiringNoodle,Like?
15-08-2020T01:12:15,SpazztasticKiwi,looks height hair n weight aren‚Äôt high up but they‚Äôre highlights
15-08-2020T01:19:50,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve only dated people I‚Äôve known before
15-08-2020T01:29:15,CrRAR,"yeah, sometimes things just feel like one big circle"
15-08-2020T01:37:24,SpazztasticKiwi,after knowing someone for awhile it doesn‚Äôt take me long to figure I‚Äôd date them tho
15-08-2020T01:51:09,CrRAR,Have you ever seen Before Sunrise/Before Sunrise movie duo? Very cute random chance romance movie with Ethan Hawke. Him and Julie Delpy are pretty adorable in them.
15-08-2020T01:52:25,CrRAR,"Linklatter's the director, which imo is hit and miss but I loved those two movies"
15-08-2020T01:53:24,CrRAR,"There is a thrid movie, but it's more about the pitfalls of marriage that anything xD more of a downer"
15-08-2020T01:54:14,CrRAR,but still emphasizes strength through commitment and whatnot
15-08-2020T01:58:39,CrRAR,"Before Sunrise/Before Sunset are the titles, I double-typed that I guess"
15-08-2020T02:04:12,CrRAR,the ending of the 2nd one will near have anyone's heart explode with happiness

15-08-2020T02:12:23,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm not miserable enough
15-08-2020T02:16:43,CrRAR,aww
15-08-2020T02:17:39,CrRAR,stick to the horrors then
15-08-2020T02:17:50,CrRAR,all the lovers die gruesome deaths xD
15-08-2020T02:18:31,CrRAR,"""hey, we're alone!"""

15-08-2020T02:34:24,DarthRexKing,Night all. owo
15-08-2020T02:34:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Jason is a pretty good option - most all his movies are rated r for nudity
15-08-2020T02:35:08,SpazztasticKiwi,& he‚Äôs never distracted from his goal by any of it
15-08-2020T02:35:11,SpazztasticKiwi,what a man

15-08-2020T02:47:23,AspiringNoodle,"RAR, if you keep using that reni, ima be tempted to steal it xD"
15-08-2020T02:47:49,CrRAR,they're ok for the taking haha
15-08-2020T02:48:05,AspiringNoodle,"And by steal, I mean ask if I can have the original file ._."
15-08-2020T02:48:25,CrRAR,if you just right-click you can save that
15-08-2020T02:49:27,AspiringNoodle,"actually, it's not letting me"
15-08-2020T02:50:37,CrRAR,"The rest was an incomplete reni sketch anyway, it must have been shared at some point. I just randomly found I had it saved somewhere."

15-08-2020T03:01:23,CrRAR,looks like picarto buried that recently maybe?
15-08-2020T03:01:42,TerraTheWizard,you could never grab them from the chat directly
15-08-2020T03:01:57,TerraTheWizard,i always saved tom's ones from the subscribe page
15-08-2020T03:02:01,CrRAR,ohh you're right
15-08-2020T03:02:04,TerraTheWizard,grabbed that one by inspect element
15-08-2020T03:02:07,CrRAR,makes sense
15-08-2020T03:02:32,CrRAR,I did share via whisper too
15-08-2020T03:02:52,TerraTheWizard,the reni's from here btw https://www.patreon.com/posts/dragon-karen-17226922
15-08-2020T03:03:44,CrRAR,"lol oh perfect, yeah it was a WIP of that"
15-08-2020T03:03:54,CrRAR,good searching
15-08-2020T03:04:15,AspiringNoodle,neat
15-08-2020T03:30:27,SpazztasticKiwi,üõå
15-08-2020T09:53:02,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-nibsdance:
15-08-2020T10:11:56,CrRAR,I think I‚Äôm gonna make pancakes

15-08-2020T10:12:19,AspiringNoodle,Can I has pancakes?
15-08-2020T10:12:27,AspiringNoodle,"Also that emote is gonna get so much mileage, lol"
15-08-2020T10:12:35,CrRAR,hehehe
15-08-2020T10:13:00,CrRAR,They ARE thin enough to make it through the mail probably :thinking:
15-08-2020T10:15:16,AspiringNoodle,Just fax them :D
15-08-2020T10:30:14,Dadrobit,Finally sat down and played the Halo campaign.
15-08-2020T10:30:40,Dadrobit,"Boy, lemme tell ya. That gameplay has not aged well."
15-08-2020T10:31:28,Dadrobit,"Story was fine, but the moment to moment gameplay, (especially the last two or three missions) was not unlike sipping tepid ass sweat through a paper straw."
15-08-2020T10:44:55,CrRAR,What difficulty?
15-08-2020T10:45:00,CrRAR,Was that Halo 1?
15-08-2020T10:45:00,Dadrobit,Normal
15-08-2020T10:45:04,CrRAR,Ah
15-08-2020T10:45:09,Dadrobit,"Yeah, just the first so far."
15-08-2020T10:45:36,CrRAR,Yeah they def didn‚Äôt have their programming scripting chops quite yet lol
15-08-2020T10:45:48,Dadrobit,"Alas, the concept of ""fun"" was still in development in 2001 and only a prototype version made it to the final release."
15-08-2020T10:46:05,CrRAR,"‚ÄúJust THROW MORE FLOOD at the player, it‚Äôll be fine!‚Äù"
15-08-2020T10:46:47,Dadrobit,"""First person platforming with a character that moves like he's ice skating, they're gonna LOVE it!"""
15-08-2020T10:47:15,CrRAR,haha
15-08-2020T10:47:19,Dadrobit,"Also, the ending is literally just the ending of Doom which I find endlessly amusing."
15-08-2020T10:47:44,CrRAR,"Light fuse, run away~"
15-08-2020T10:48:02,CrRAR,"(oh, and frogblast the ventcore)"
15-08-2020T10:48:03,Dadrobit,The shooting rockets into a hole to win part I mean
15-08-2020T10:48:08,CrRAR,Ahh lol
15-08-2020T10:48:15,CrRAR,That is highly specific
15-08-2020T10:48:17,Dadrobit,while endless waved of the damned swarm you
15-08-2020T10:48:23,Dadrobit,waves*
15-08-2020T10:48:50,Dadrobit,"Doom only had one hole to shoot the rockets into, Halo had FOUR! Four times the FUN!"
15-08-2020T10:49:56,Dadrobit,Doom 2 specifically
15-08-2020T11:01:55,NibblyBot,New Patreon Post: Robin Hood Laura https://www.patreon.com/posts/robin-hood-laura-40370381
15-08-2020T11:02:11,Xexanoth,it worked fine once it's gonna work again XD
15-08-2020T11:02:32,Xexanoth,"also, yay keith in a dress"
15-08-2020T11:05:00,AspiringNoodle,"Dadro, you should play The conduit for the Wii :P"
15-08-2020T11:05:24,AspiringNoodle,There's a mission where you need to destroy 4 portals inside an outdoor monument
15-08-2020T11:05:30,AspiringNoodle,While they endlessly spawn enemies
15-08-2020T11:05:36,AspiringNoodle,And some enemies can insta-kill you
15-08-2020T11:06:09,AspiringNoodle,The shoes! :ptv-laugh:
15-08-2020T11:08:53,Dadrobit,Nope. Halo already had that one hit kill bullshit in droves. Done with it.
15-08-2020T11:09:23,Xexanoth,Halo has 1 shot kills on normal?
15-08-2020T11:09:27,Xexanoth,don't remember that
15-08-2020T11:09:37,Dadrobit,"Yup, rocket launchers and grenades."
15-08-2020T11:09:51,Dadrobit,"if a plasma gets stuck to you, you're fucked"
15-08-2020T11:10:21,Xexanoth,oh right yeah the plasma nades
15-08-2020T11:10:27,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
15-08-2020T11:10:34,Xexanoth,"eh just ""git gud"" :ptv-SteelwormHades:"
15-08-2020T11:10:53,AspiringNoodle,"Only Dark Souls has a right to say that, lol"
15-08-2020T11:10:57,AspiringNoodle,Is tough but fair
15-08-2020T11:11:44,Xexanoth,"depends on the dark souls, cause dark souls 2 is just ""we forgot how to make difficult things so we just spam enemies at you because the game isn't made to handle many enemies at once"""
15-08-2020T11:11:54,Dadrobit,It legit made me pause the game and go for a walk a couple times getting OHK outta nowhere because there some some Flood asshole with a rocket launcher and I didn't see them coming.
15-08-2020T11:12:15,AspiringNoodle,"I'll be honest, Dark Souls 2 was *okay*, but the healing / durability mechanics were just awful..."
15-08-2020T11:12:48,AspiringNoodle,"Legit, one boss from the Eleum Lloyce DLC nearly broke my weapon"
15-08-2020T11:13:03,Xexanoth,"fair @dadrobit guess it helped that i played it back in the day and ""balanced game design"" was a lot less common sense"
15-08-2020T11:13:14,AspiringNoodle,And the bonfire was literally a short jaunt from the fog door... so a boss nearly drained my weapon's entire durability
15-08-2020T11:13:45,Xexanoth,you mean the acid dragon boss?
15-08-2020T11:13:49,AspiringNoodle,Nope
15-08-2020T11:14:03,AspiringNoodle,Aava
15-08-2020T11:14:16,AspiringNoodle,"I used the spear with infinite durability against that mofo, lol"
15-08-2020T11:14:26,Dadrobit,"I mean, fuck, I don't have time to play games a lot anymore. Wasting time restarting again and again because of shit like that is doubly annoying."
15-08-2020T11:14:41,Xexanoth,don't remember that boss... i just remember that stupid acid dragon.
15-08-2020T11:14:52,AspiringNoodle,That one is from the first DLC
15-08-2020T11:15:15,Dadrobit,"If I was 20 years younger, hell yeah. Now? I'll be playing the rest on easy and just play the damn story."
15-08-2020T11:15:30,Xexanoth,"yeah, and somehow people always complain about how games ""are to easy now"" but forget how stupid lot's of the difficulty was just unfun."
15-08-2020T11:16:11,Dadrobit,Grandfathered game design from when folks had to pay 50 cents for a shot and the game was actively trying to kill you.
15-08-2020T11:16:39,Xexanoth,or in case of nintendo games just the shortness of the games
15-08-2020T11:16:53,AspiringNoodle,"Xaxa, did you play the Ivory / Old Iron King dlc's?"
15-08-2020T11:17:29,Dadrobit,Halo isn't that long either. Beat it in a night.
15-08-2020T11:17:31,AspiringNoodle,"Because they both, imo, have the most *BULLSHIT* segments in the entire game"
15-08-2020T11:17:46,Xexanoth,"i think, i honestly have no idea anymore, i really didn't like DS2 that much."
15-08-2020T11:17:54,Xexanoth,so i forget most of it
15-08-2020T11:18:05,AspiringNoodle,"While I criticize Dark Souls 2 for the ""kill something 10 times and it stops spawning mechanic"", it was the only thing that made some sections doable..."
15-08-2020T11:18:38,AspiringNoodle,"In the Ivory King DLC, Aava is a boss that's clearly designed as a ""if you can't see it, you need to go the other way first"" boss"
15-08-2020T11:19:10,AspiringNoodle,"Until you get a key item later in the level, you will not be able to actually see the boss.  It's a tough one in its own right, but being invisible make's it a Herculean task"
15-08-2020T11:19:45,AspiringNoodle,"There's an optional area in the DLC as well.  It's known as ""Reindeer valley"""
15-08-2020T11:20:38,AspiringNoodle,"It's one super long corridor where the gimmick is blizzards constantly roll through the area, reducing visibility to near zero.  To get to the boss at the end of the zone, you sprint between the buildings"
15-08-2020T11:21:03,AspiringNoodle,"If you're out in the open during the blizzard, these 4-legged buttholes spawn.  They're fast, hit hard, and can throw lightning"
15-08-2020T11:21:22,Xexanoth,"hmm yeah i don't think i played that, but that does not sound fun"
15-08-2020T11:21:27,AspiringNoodle,It's not
15-08-2020T11:21:45,AspiringNoodle,I died to the boss of the area so much that I was able to get the reindeer to stop spawning
15-08-2020T11:22:15,AspiringNoodle,"They don't have normal spawns either, they have spawn points sprinkled around the map that trigger during the blizzard"
15-08-2020T11:22:30,AspiringNoodle,So you gotta drain the points to stop them from spawning along your chosen run path
15-08-2020T11:23:01,AspiringNoodle,"And even AFTER preventing them from spawning, the area is accessed by the ol' ""hop in this coffin and fun stuff will happen"" cutscene"
15-08-2020T11:23:07,TheSexyBeast,üëã
15-08-2020T11:23:25,AspiringNoodle,There's no bonfire in the valley.  You literally have to do the cutscene every single friggin' attempt
15-08-2020T11:23:39,AspiringNoodle,And then it's still a solid 4-ish minute run to the boss room...
15-08-2020T11:23:58,AspiringNoodle,"And to top it all off, the boss of the optional area is just Aava x2"
15-08-2020T11:24:08,CrRAR,:wave::ccrrar-rocky: hey sexy
15-08-2020T11:24:42,AspiringNoodle,The other super BS segment I remember most is the run to one of the best bosses in the game
15-08-2020T11:24:48,Xexanoth,"Aava x2, yeah that just sound like the ""great"" DS2 boss design"
15-08-2020T11:24:51,TheSexyBeast,"When a game starts to feel like work, it goes on the shelf or maybe straight to GameStop."
15-08-2020T11:25:35,AspiringNoodle,The strategy for that boss is more or less nuke Aava #1 down super fast before Aava #2 gets in the fight
15-08-2020T11:25:43,AspiringNoodle,Because #2 doesn't step in until about 50%
15-08-2020T11:26:02,AspiringNoodle,Sir Alonne was a mixed bag...
15-08-2020T11:26:08,AspiringNoodle,The boss fight was *amazing*
15-08-2020T11:26:08,TheSexyBeast,"I want to relax, not feel like I'm cramming for a test."
15-08-2020T11:26:22,AspiringNoodle,But the run to his room was a fuggin' SLOG
15-08-2020T11:26:32,AspiringNoodle,You know how fog running is a thing?
15-08-2020T11:27:04,AspiringNoodle,"Well, for whatever reason, the team decided to litter this DLC with samurai type enemies who run 2x as fast as you"
15-08-2020T11:27:18,AspiringNoodle,So you have no choice but to go through and kill everything in your path...
15-08-2020T11:28:15,AspiringNoodle,I have almost 114 hours in Dark Souls 2.  Don't plan on playing it again :ptv-laugh:
15-08-2020T11:28:25,Xexanoth,i feel like i made a good decision to never play past the first DLC
15-08-2020T11:29:31,AspiringNoodle,"The DLC did have some of the best boss fights in the game, ngl"
15-08-2020T11:30:12,AspiringNoodle,"The acid dragon in particular was one of the best, if not a complete a-hole move by the developers"
15-08-2020T11:30:26,AspiringNoodle,"You know, putting in an enemy that breaks weapons super quick in a game where durability is already an issue"
15-08-2020T11:30:34,TheSexyBeast,"BIAB, lunchtime."
15-08-2020T11:30:43,AspiringNoodle,Get pizza :eyes:
15-08-2020T11:32:51,AspiringNoodle,*sigh*
15-08-2020T11:33:11,AspiringNoodle,"Dark Souls 2 was decent, but imo the estus changes / soul memory made the game rather unenjoyable"
15-08-2020T11:33:47,AspiringNoodle,Cannot tell you how many times I died because my estus heal was only 25 - 50% done when I took a hit
15-08-2020T11:33:50,Xexanoth,my biggest problem with the acid dragon was how it didn't matter to mages
15-08-2020T11:33:59,Xexanoth,which already are the strongest character class
15-08-2020T11:34:10,AspiringNoodle,"PvE wise, yes. Pvp, no. :P"
15-08-2020T11:34:34,AspiringNoodle,"fun fact, Dark Souls has a hidden difficulty selection"
15-08-2020T11:34:44,AspiringNoodle,"Pure melee is the hardest setting, while casters are easy mode."
15-08-2020T11:37:21,AspiringNoodle,"Definitely recommend DS3, though"
15-08-2020T11:37:26,AspiringNoodle,Game is way better~
15-08-2020T11:37:35,Xexanoth,also in case anyone cares and doesn't already know Summer games done quick has just started
15-08-2020T11:37:41,AspiringNoodle,:O
15-08-2020T11:37:45,AspiringNoodle,Thanks for the heads up!
15-08-2020T11:38:02,AspiringNoodle,I'ma... I'ma go do something else for a bit
15-08-2020T11:38:05,Xexanoth,they're playing demon souls XD
15-08-2020T11:38:15,AspiringNoodle,Definitely not watch the entire stream :sweat_drops:
15-08-2020T11:38:51,AspiringNoodle,"Also, Demon Souls: Solid first entry"
15-08-2020T11:39:09,AspiringNoodle,Only issue is the alignment mechanic and healing mechanics
15-08-2020T11:40:17,Xexanoth,kinda impossible to watch the whole stream :ptv-laugh:
15-08-2020T11:41:28,AspiringNoodle,"Btw, I am TOTALLY getting the remaster of that game"
15-08-2020T11:41:43,AspiringNoodle,"Okay, Ima eat + watch then get back to work"

15-08-2020T19:48:41,MuonNeutrino,"it's a human stove in a human house, and we know they like to use dragon symbology"
15-08-2020T19:48:45,JSWolf,Where the originating of titles is largely meritocratic but they're then passed down
15-08-2020T19:48:46,MuonNeutrino,so not surprising
15-08-2020T19:48:50,MisterWho,And the longest ruler ever now. King Josepf II from Austria ruled 68 year...image that.
15-08-2020T19:49:01,JSWolf,...so would Trace and Flora's kid also be Duke of Edinmire someday?

15-08-2020T19:50:06,ShamusTheFox,Interesting...
15-08-2020T19:50:09,MuonNeutrino,"according to wikipedia she hasn't passed 3 others yet, that'd take another 4 years"

15-08-2020T19:51:15,MuonNeutrino,"yeah, it's an affectation more than anything"
15-08-2020T19:51:24,Roughlandin,"Well, not lands that he legally owns"
15-08-2020T19:51:48,Paxpup,Land taken is the whole gig of royalty
15-08-2020T19:52:00,MuonNeutrino,"he might wield as much practical power as some princes, but i doubt he actually *is* one"

15-08-2020T19:52:58,MuonNeutrino,this is probably before saria married trace

15-08-2020T19:54:34,steelabjur,Same age as Zen.
15-08-2020T19:54:45,MuonNeutrino,"only one year older than nat, which makes him holding such a position of power as early as TDM kinda interesting"

15-08-2020T21:11:25,TomatoBasket,"I was wondering why Tom's art looked more kevlar than ususal, and it is because he is drawing a kevlar droid."
15-08-2020T21:11:32,TomatoBasket,yay
15-08-2020T21:11:33,justAblank,Ara is my probably favorite character
15-08-2020T21:11:42,justAblank,just from anything
15-08-2020T21:11:55,Brocade,Ara has clothes on for once
15-08-2020T21:11:56,TomatoBasket,Ara is indeed a very well crafted character.
15-08-2020T21:12:12,BluePhantom90,Ara is loved but not in a comic yet besides small comics by Fluff.
15-08-2020T21:12:18,BADBackgroundProductions,"Wow, a lot of new faces to today!"
15-08-2020T21:12:25,TomatoBasket,A lot of artists have well crafted characters after a while.

15-08-2020T21:13:29,CrRAR,hey rgere vevens
15-08-2020T21:13:36,justAblank,this is looking very cute
15-08-2020T21:13:38,vevans0009,Wait.....is this Ara? 8o
15-08-2020T21:13:42,Roughlandin,It be!

15-08-2020T21:13:53,CrRAR,very astute
15-08-2020T21:14:01,CrRAR,observation
15-08-2020T21:14:03,vevans0009,Dead ringer to how Fluf draws her. 8D
15-08-2020T21:14:09,Roughlandin,The ear stripey gives her away
15-08-2020T21:14:30,CrRAR,signature chevron styling
15-08-2020T21:14:37,vevans0009,Well that too but the front face and color pattern. xD
15-08-2020T21:14:38,TomatoBasket,I wonder if kevlar will hire a studio of artists on to help with the comic. Most comic companies eventually hires a team to handle different steps of the artistic process.
15-08-2020T21:15:12,vevans0009,I'm speechless Tom. 8o
15-08-2020T21:15:14,Roughlandin,Is it me or is Tom drawing ARA in less clothes than Fluff usually does lol?
15-08-2020T21:15:14,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-nibsdance:

15-08-2020T21:16:17,Ordithus,he's still drawing
15-08-2020T21:16:26,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,she is wearing an outfit
15-08-2020T21:16:27,Roughlandin,Guess I did lol
15-08-2020T21:16:53,Roughlandin,"No Tom, it's cool. Tube top ARA is fine!"
15-08-2020T21:16:57,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,I think I recognize what outfit
15-08-2020T21:16:59,vevans0009,Tom's take on her is spot on.
15-08-2020T21:17:23,vevans0009,You scare me man. xD
15-08-2020T21:17:24,Roughlandin,"I think that's her standard bridge uniform dress, yeah"
15-08-2020T21:17:52,HeresyArtStream,Ayy it's Ara :3

15-08-2020T21:18:35,vevans0009,Oh yeah?
15-08-2020T21:18:39,vevans0009,Cool
15-08-2020T21:18:42,vevans0009,8>
15-08-2020T21:18:54,Combak,Hi Heresy!
15-08-2020T21:19:06,vevans0009,Known them for YEARS.  Alot of improving.
15-08-2020T21:19:13,Roughlandin,"ARA to Flora: ""I'm sorry. But your state of dress is below the minimum standard for the main deck. I'm afraid I'll have to escort you to the brig."""
15-08-2020T21:19:20,TomatoBasket,"Random thought. Does anyone know why Tom hasn't hired on a small studio staff to help with the comic? I know there are artists out there that prefer to work solo, but this is a question I just only now realized and suddenly desire an answer to."
15-08-2020T21:19:37,Roughlandin,That'd be very expensive
15-08-2020T21:19:42,Ordithus,very
15-08-2020T21:19:43,vevans0009,Personal reason we can't comprehend
15-08-2020T21:19:44,vevans0009,?
15-08-2020T21:19:55,vevans0009,Or that
15-08-2020T21:20:02,Roughlandin,Or he'd have to pay them basically nothing. Which would be... pretty unfair
15-08-2020T21:20:08,Ordithus,exposure!
15-08-2020T21:20:21,justAblank,tbh i wouldnt want to see his comic very badly if he didnt draw it
15-08-2020T21:20:42,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-flomad:
15-08-2020T21:20:46,TomatoBasket,"I mean, it is a curiosity."

15-08-2020T21:20:59,TomatoBasket,"I am not telling him to hire, rather I just am curious why he hasn't."
15-08-2020T21:21:09,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,this is Ara
15-08-2020T21:21:13,vevans0009,Right
15-08-2020T21:21:17,TomatoBasket,I know the Berserk manga author works solo.

15-08-2020T21:21:30,justAblank,sorry if that came off negativly i dont mean it that way
15-08-2020T21:21:31,Roughlandin,He'd probably need to make an extra 200k a year to pay a decent salary to a drawing team
15-08-2020T21:21:32,vevans0009,Hi Keef
15-08-2020T21:21:39,CrRAR,wow keef

15-08-2020T21:22:09,Roughlandin,"You missed all the Mike squishing, Evs drooling, and Rose butt"
15-08-2020T21:22:20,vevans0009,.....Rose butt?
15-08-2020T21:22:21,KeefMcDerpface,Also nearly 4 hours of stream? Did Tom start late or had to restart?
15-08-2020T21:22:27,vevans0009,8o
15-08-2020T21:22:30,Roughlandin,He had to restart
15-08-2020T21:22:36,Roughlandin,Music was bugged
15-08-2020T21:22:40,BADBackgroundProductions,Keef! Hi!

15-08-2020T21:22:49,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,I am gonna go get a drink real quick
15-08-2020T21:22:52,CrRAR,ok
15-08-2020T21:23:23,TomatoBasket,"probably. If it is a cost thing, I suspest there is a point where the studio staff make back the money that they are paid from faster turn-around/higher quality overall, or somesuch. Like how some manga studios distribute labor of sketching, inks,"
15-08-2020T21:23:28,TomatoBasket,and color over three people total.
15-08-2020T21:23:29,vevans0009,Dig the exposed thighs
15-08-2020T21:23:40,TomatoBasket,Now I want to start my own comic studio...
15-08-2020T21:23:47,TomatoBasket,"Oh, well"
15-08-2020T21:23:48,CrRAR,very Egyptian~
15-08-2020T21:24:01,Roughlandin,I don't think Tom should model anything he does off the manga industry. It's not exactly... healthy
15-08-2020T21:24:08,vevans0009,Oh god.  Personal garb weakness
15-08-2020T21:24:11,vevans0009,x3
15-08-2020T21:24:20,vevans0009,nope
15-08-2020T21:24:37,TomatoBasket,"There are downsides to having a studio, don't get me wrong."
15-08-2020T21:25:05,TomatoBasket,I am just rambling as I watch ARA appear on screen.
15-08-2020T21:25:19,CrRAR,possibly
15-08-2020T21:25:53,Roughlandin,"I'm not trying to be mean, Tomato. Just, look up what the working conditions of a manga or animation studio are like. They're not... good for the artists... typically"
15-08-2020T21:25:55,vevans0009,She is just a pretty thing.
15-08-2020T21:26:06,TomatoBasket,"I know, Rough."
15-08-2020T21:26:14,TomatoBasket,Most of them are starving artists.
15-08-2020T21:26:16,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,I wonder if Ara has been transported to Mekkan or if its the reverse? :ctwokinds-floraquestion:
15-08-2020T21:26:17,TomatoBasket,Literally

15-08-2020T22:03:23,Roughlandin,Flora's hubby isn't in the industry. Also his name is Debra. She's an architect
15-08-2020T22:03:25,KeefMcDerpface,Intresting
15-08-2020T22:03:29,ProsePro7,Apparently there are two Modern AU

15-08-2020T22:04:14,Roughlandin,Not even Saria can resist the power of BUTTCHAT!
15-08-2020T22:04:15,RimaDraws,i've done that to a coworker at work who walked past me
15-08-2020T22:04:20,RimaDraws,and all i did was turn my head

15-08-2020T22:04:50,Roughlandin,No one expects the buttchat inquisition!
15-08-2020T22:04:52,Brocade,holy shit my idea was not popular at all
15-08-2020T22:04:55,MuonNeutrino,"headcanon: Rose actually did hear what Saria whispered, and starts wearing an apron in the kitchen...... and nothing else"
15-08-2020T22:04:59,MuonNeutrino,>.>
15-08-2020T22:05:01,ProsePro7,Cooking has never been so entertaining

15-08-2020T22:05:30,MuonNeutrino,honestly i could actually see Rose doing that just to mess with her
15-08-2020T22:05:32,Stormagedon,Butt chat is back? Yay!
15-08-2020T22:05:34,ProsePro7,"Speaking of storms, lightening out side of house"
15-08-2020T22:05:34,Twokinds,"I kinda thought maybe this is the first week Rose started living with Saria, hence Rose calling her Mistress and being nervous around her."
15-08-2020T22:05:47,Twokinds,And Saria never seeing Rose naked before.
15-08-2020T22:05:55,Combak,Makes sense to me!
15-08-2020T22:05:58,CrRAR,ah okay
15-08-2020T22:05:58,MuonNeutrino,"well, you conveyed that vibe well, that's what it felt like to me"
15-08-2020T22:06:02,Ordithus,at least not... paying attention
15-08-2020T22:06:03,Roughlandin,Saria will get used to it
15-08-2020T22:06:06,ProsePro7,Tom you need to straighten out this time line it is a mess
15-08-2020T22:06:08,BadFoMo,So this awoke something in Saria?

15-08-2020T22:07:44,CrRAR,sounds gud
15-08-2020T22:08:02,Roughlandin,I finally got my network issues fixed. Had to buy a new wifi card
15-08-2020T22:08:26,RimaDraws,i am having anticipation over my stylus coming in this week. i really hope i made just a tiny mistake of getting the wrong one
15-08-2020T22:08:38,Roughlandin,Apparently they stopped making drivers for my old Rosewill and Windows 10 didn't like it...
15-08-2020T22:08:55,RimaDraws,well the support team told me i ordered the wrong pen
15-08-2020T22:08:59,RimaDraws,so i hope that is all it was
15-08-2020T22:09:07,KeefMcDerpface,oh
15-08-2020T22:09:12,Roughlandin,Hopefully Rima
15-08-2020T22:09:15,KeefMcDerpface,"Yeah, hopefully."
15-08-2020T22:09:27,AspiringNoodle,^
15-08-2020T22:09:29,RimaDraws,i have been craving to do digital art again
15-08-2020T22:09:36,Roughlandin,Fingers crossed!
15-08-2020T22:09:38,AspiringNoodle,I once had to RMA a monitor for a shadow issue...
15-08-2020T22:09:47,AspiringNoodle,The wait was one of the hardest things I ever done
15-08-2020T22:09:55,KeefMcDerpface,How long?
15-08-2020T22:09:56,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,I hope thats all it was
15-08-2020T22:10:08,RimaDraws,its been since may i think
15-08-2020T22:10:15,AspiringNoodle,It was like a week and a half or so?
15-08-2020T22:10:16,RimaDraws,so quite a while
15-08-2020T22:10:28,KeefMcDerpface,You ordered back in May?
15-08-2020T22:10:40,Roughlandin,Woof. Well I'm getting off too. Night everybody! Glad to catch a stream again!
15-08-2020T22:10:43,AspiringNoodle,I'm using an XG2703-GS from ViewSonic
15-08-2020T22:10:49,Roughlandin,Night! o/
15-08-2020T22:10:53,KeefMcDerpface,bye Rough
15-08-2020T22:11:04,AspiringNoodle,The left side of my monitor has a strip of pixels spanning most of the vertical that weren't functioning quite right
15-08-2020T22:11:34,AspiringNoodle,"Under certain circumstances, it was easy to tell they were slightly discolored.  The more disturbing part was that the shape of this stretch was slowly changing over time.  Sometimes getting smaller, sometimes bigger"
15-08-2020T22:11:50,KeefMcDerpface,Uh oh.
15-08-2020T22:12:04,AspiringNoodle,I was having trouble showing the issue to CS until a piece of 3d software had a particular spot that made the problem area go haywire
15-08-2020T22:12:14,KeefMcDerpface,wow
15-08-2020T22:12:28,AspiringNoodle,It noticeably flickered.  Enough where video on my phone showed clearly what was wrong
15-08-2020T22:13:07,AspiringNoodle,"Don't know if they fixed it or not.  When I got it back, it was damaged"
15-08-2020T22:13:42,AspiringNoodle,"Upper right portion of the frame was broken.  It was a small bit of damage, but apparently it damaged the panel and I had a nice bit of spiderwebbing when I plugged it in"
15-08-2020T22:14:10,AspiringNoodle,"At that point, a customer service rep just authorized a new monitor be sent my way.  And I've been happy ever since :ptv-hearts:"
15-08-2020T22:14:20,KeefMcDerpface,\o/
15-08-2020T22:14:22,KeefMcDerpface,Yay!
15-08-2020T22:14:53,AspiringNoodle,"New monitor's got a few dim pixels here and there, but unless I actively look for them, I forget they're there.  They blend in that much, lol"
15-08-2020T22:15:15,AspiringNoodle,"Honestly, 99% of the time I confuse them for dust on the screen!"
15-08-2020T22:16:04,KeefMcDerpface,Even the replacement has issues?! (Granted not bad but still.)
15-08-2020T22:16:34,AspiringNoodle,"Tbh, a perfect panel is like winning the lottery"
15-08-2020T22:17:02,AspiringNoodle,LED screens are likely to have backlight bleed in the corners
15-08-2020T22:17:41,AspiringNoodle,"Most manufacturers have faulty pixel policies which require pixels to be either dead or stuck a set color, and have a certain amount clustered in a given region of the screen"
15-08-2020T22:18:40,AspiringNoodle,"I'm trying to remember, but for a 1440p screen, it's something like 5 stuck / dead pixels in the center warrant a return, 9 in a side or top / bottom area, 12 for corners"
15-08-2020T22:18:57,AspiringNoodle,Spacing and / or clustering can change that amount
15-08-2020T22:19:31,AspiringNoodle,"And dim pixels don't really contribute because, like I said, they blend :P"
15-08-2020T22:21:14,AspiringNoodle,I think I have a goal for tonight
15-08-2020T22:21:22,KeefMcDerpface,?
15-08-2020T22:21:40,AspiringNoodle,"After watching Tom / Fluff's streams, I just need to bit the bullet and cut out some time wasters"
15-08-2020T22:22:06,AspiringNoodle,Pick 2 active channels from my youtube subs and axe them
15-08-2020T22:22:21,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-katwet: I am the clean now
15-08-2020T22:22:26,KeefMcDerpface,\o/
15-08-2020T22:22:28,KeefMcDerpface,Yay!
15-08-2020T22:22:34,AspiringNoodle,Did you use shampoo AND conditioner?
15-08-2020T22:22:37,AspiringNoodle,And body wash?
15-08-2020T22:23:25,RimaDraws,i use a combination of shampoo and conditioner
15-08-2020T22:23:35,RimaDraws,i use soap. body wash doesn't feel like it gets the job done
15-08-2020T22:23:47,AspiringNoodle,Do you use combination shampoo + conditioner?
15-08-2020T22:23:53,AspiringNoodle,That's what I use 'cuz I'm lazy ._.
15-08-2020T22:23:58,Ordithus,mostly used water.  shampoo and soap tonight
15-08-2020T22:24:36,AspiringNoodle,Random tangent... any of you play Resident Evil 2? The remake?
15-08-2020T22:24:42,Ordithus,erilas Mike lol
15-08-2020T22:24:45,KeefMcDerpface,yeah
15-08-2020T22:25:07,AspiringNoodle,Resident Evil 2 but ALL ENEMIES are 250% FASTER: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs-Xoc7WkTE
15-08-2020T22:25:16,KeefMcDerpface,:ptv-shock: Oh gosh...
15-08-2020T22:25:27,AspiringNoodle,"Btw, I feel so bad for Leon in this version..."
15-08-2020T22:25:38,AspiringNoodle,"Literally his first day, and they even put up little banners and everything to welcome him!"
15-08-2020T22:25:49,KeefMcDerpface,I know.
15-08-2020T22:25:51,AspiringNoodle,"But no, effing zombies and effing T-virus because effing Umbrella -3-"
15-08-2020T22:26:16,AspiringNoodle,Did they have a cake lying around somewhere?
15-08-2020T22:26:24,AspiringNoodle,Would've been a nice touch
15-08-2020T22:26:33,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,Umbrella wanted to welcome Leon too
15-08-2020T22:26:46,KeefMcDerpface,I forgot the name of the achievement but it made me chuckle when I saw it. (Something about first day on the job.)
15-08-2020T22:28:38,AspiringNoodle,My first foray into resident evil was the RE:make for the gamecube
15-08-2020T22:28:46,AspiringNoodle,But... I didn't get far... lol
15-08-2020T22:28:58,AspiringNoodle,RE4 was the first one I finished
15-08-2020T22:29:09,KeefMcDerpface,Puzzles or jump scares?
15-08-2020T22:29:24,AspiringNoodle,"Foraging, LMAO"
15-08-2020T22:29:40,AspiringNoodle,"BRB, bio"
15-08-2020T22:29:51,KeefMcDerpface,ol
15-08-2020T22:29:53,KeefMcDerpface,ok
15-08-2020T22:31:01,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,wonder how Flora would react to wearing a cone of shame?
15-08-2020T22:31:21,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,:ctwokinds-floAAA:
15-08-2020T22:31:26,KeefMcDerpface,Disappointed I assume.
15-08-2020T22:31:49,KeefMcDerpface,"And may claw everyone who smiles, chuckles, laughs, giggles, etc."
15-08-2020T22:32:48,RimaDraws,i tried to cone of shame my cat when he had a bad spot on his head
15-08-2020T22:32:51,RimaDraws,he was not having it
15-08-2020T22:33:21,KeefMcDerpface,"hehe, yeah, was gonna say Flora might act like an actual house cat."
15-08-2020T22:33:57,KeefMcDerpface,"The hissing, the clawing, the biting."
15-08-2020T22:35:38,RimaDraws,mine was trying to get it off
15-08-2020T22:36:05,AspiringNoodle,Back
15-08-2020T22:36:08,KeefMcDerpface,wb
15-08-2020T22:36:33,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,Flora has hands though she can just remove it
15-08-2020T22:36:38,AspiringNoodle,"So when I played Resident Evil, I was 10.  I didn't ever consider checking things like cabinets or desks, lol"
15-08-2020T22:36:47,AspiringNoodle,"So suffice to say, I missed a lot of stuff"
15-08-2020T22:36:50,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,gotta be magic removal prevention then
15-08-2020T22:39:10,KeefMcDerpface,"Oh, I hate missing stuff."
15-08-2020T22:39:17,AspiringNoodle,Well... I ran out of ammo
15-08-2020T22:39:25,KeefMcDerpface,That's worse...!
15-08-2020T22:39:29,AspiringNoodle,Zombies were taking 6+ shots to kill
15-08-2020T22:39:31,Ordithus,could combine the cone with a control collar... *shudders*
15-08-2020T22:39:45,AspiringNoodle,"I completed it about 1.5 years ago, though"
15-08-2020T22:39:53,AspiringNoodle,"Took me 13 hours,e ven with a guide"
15-08-2020T22:40:03,AspiringNoodle,And I learned that the RE:make for the gamecube is arguably the hardest version
15-08-2020T22:40:05,KeefMcDerpface,Were you aiming for the head or just panicked fire?
15-08-2020T22:40:31,KeefMcDerpface,"Yeah, the RE games are not short."
15-08-2020T22:40:35,KeefMcDerpface,Or easy.
15-08-2020T22:40:58,AspiringNoodle,The RE:make took a lot of the ammo out of the game from the original version
15-08-2020T22:41:05,SonOfGoku,That's why I enjoyed playing with the Chicago typewriter and the infinite launcher in RE4
15-08-2020T22:41:25,KeefMcDerpface,"Ah yes, the Chicago typewriter."
15-08-2020T22:41:29,AspiringNoodle,"Too much, arguably."
15-08-2020T22:42:10,AspiringNoodle,"I searched around on forums, and people seem to agree that RE1 for gamecube is one of, if not, the most punishing games in the series"
15-08-2020T22:42:16,RimaDraws,well it is time for bed. i gotta be up at 5
15-08-2020T22:42:18,KeefMcDerpface,Did you do the thing were you shot them until they fell and melee them while they were on the ground?
15-08-2020T22:42:21,KeefMcDerpface,bye Rima
15-08-2020T22:42:22,AspiringNoodle,Night rima
15-08-2020T22:42:26,Ordithus,"nini rima, sleep well"
15-08-2020T22:42:27,RimaDraws,nighty guys
15-08-2020T22:42:31,AspiringNoodle,I think so
15-08-2020T22:42:32,RimaDraws,i will try ord. you too
15-08-2020T22:42:39,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,Night Rima
15-08-2020T22:42:45,RimaDraws,nighty claw
15-08-2020T22:42:45,AspiringNoodle,I started up RE4 after not playing it for 5+ years and started a fresh game on professional
15-08-2020T22:42:59,KeefMcDerpface,"Oh, the og RE1. Nevermind."
15-08-2020T22:43:27,AspiringNoodle,I take it that wasn't an option in the gamecube version?
15-08-2020T22:43:54,KeefMcDerpface,I never played the original... :eyes:
15-08-2020T22:45:34,AspiringNoodle,Apparently you never want to complete both campaigns
15-08-2020T22:45:46,AspiringNoodle,Because then that triggers a new mode automatically that you can't turn off iirc
15-08-2020T22:46:42,AspiringNoodle,"Yup.  If you beat both Jill and Chris' campaigns on both versions, One Dangerous Zombie is turned on and can't be turned off"
15-08-2020T22:47:15,KeefMcDerpface,One Dangerous Zombie...? Sounds... Dangerous.:ptv-confused:
15-08-2020T22:47:39,AspiringNoodle,Basically another STARS member went full zombie and will harass you throughout the mansion
15-08-2020T22:48:04,AspiringNoodle,"He'll be waiting outside doors as you leave rooms, hidden in areas of rooms as you enter.  And you can't hurt him at all because he has a grenade vest equipped"
15-08-2020T22:48:13,AspiringNoodle,"If you damage him, the vest detonates and you die instantly"
15-08-2020T22:48:39,KeefMcDerpface,"hmmm, zombie STARS member or spider room. Zombie STARS member or spider room...."
15-08-2020T22:49:14,AspiringNoodle,You wanna hear the extra fun mode that can be attempted in that game for secret outfits / end screen?
15-08-2020T22:49:42,KeefMcDerpface,I'm game. :eyes: (We're still on the og RE1 right?)
15-08-2020T22:50:16,AspiringNoodle,Yes
15-08-2020T22:50:19,KeefMcDerpface,ok
15-08-2020T22:50:25,AspiringNoodle,Invisible Enemy + Real Survival
15-08-2020T22:51:00,KeefMcDerpface,:ptv-sad: And this is where I die...
15-08-2020T22:51:17,AspiringNoodle,Pretty much
15-08-2020T22:51:34,AspiringNoodle,Requires you to use knowledge / environmental clues
15-08-2020T22:52:03,AspiringNoodle,"Some areas of the mansion actually have mirrors placed in the corner of hallways, and invisible enemies are visible in them"
15-08-2020T22:53:49,KeefMcDerpface,"Ah, reverse vampires."
15-08-2020T22:59:44,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
15-08-2020T22:59:48,KeefMcDerpface,bye Ord
15-08-2020T23:00:16,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,Night Ord
15-08-2020T23:00:56,AspiringNoodle,Nighty Ord
15-08-2020T23:47:58,KeefMcDerpface,\o Night all. :ptv-sleepy:
