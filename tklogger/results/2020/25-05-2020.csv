25-05-2020T18:12:38,RimaDraws,also no men's pants are not same size across brands. neither are women's because it depends where they are made

25-05-2020T19:27:35,SpazztasticKiwi,leggings would be nice but I‚Äôm not sure if they‚Äôd be ok with it in my work area
25-05-2020T19:27:42,RimaDraws,i was wondering how that sentence was supposed to be said
25-05-2020T19:28:00,SpazztasticKiwi,& I‚Äôve yet to find leggings that agree with me
25-05-2020T19:28:10,RimaDraws,i found some for me.
25-05-2020T19:28:18,RimaDraws,i have like only 4 pairs of leggings
25-05-2020T19:31:29,SpazztasticKiwi,"I know looking through men‚Äôs clothes, the pants are actually  straightforward measure wise"
25-05-2020T19:32:33,SpazztasticKiwi,the jeans I have now that I‚Äôm replacing are 16p faded glory and close to two inches too loose so I need replacements
