21-02-2020T02:00:11,henner,"yo kamel, i really enjoy your artstyle, its really unique to anything ive ever seen before, like the way you shape out the characters heads and faces are instantly recognisable and like nothing ive ever seen from any other artist"
21-02-2020T02:00:15,henner,also
21-02-2020T02:00:55,Kameloh,aw thanks! that means a lot :D
21-02-2020T02:01:34,Kameloh,always trying to get better :eyes:
21-02-2020T02:02:13,henner,"whit i find really unique is the way that you take the cute cartoony style sketches and make it into like the modern video game style bloched on digital painting, it gives of a very atmospheric strange vibe."
21-02-2020T02:03:13,henner,i tend to find the blocked on color with the soft brush in artworks for like world of warcraft and huge corporation games
21-02-2020T02:03:17,Kameloh,thanks! wish I could paint things faster ... they can be fun but tedious :cat:
21-02-2020T02:03:27,henner,yea same
21-02-2020T02:03:50,henner,i spend like 10+ hours on a full piece
21-02-2020T02:04:27,Kameloh,when I first started painting a few years back a picture took like 3-5 months to complete
21-02-2020T02:05:27,henner,"my art is okay, i feel like im at the point where im starting to enjoy my art rather than hate it, and im just beginning to make my own style, but im still kinda trash to some folks i think"
21-02-2020T02:06:40,Kameloh,that's understandable -- a lot of people feel that way at all skill levels
21-02-2020T02:10:16,henner,yea im not exactly sure what others think of my art cuz nobody has ever really seen my stuff or given a proper opinion
21-02-2020T02:10:27,Trololohstuffs,:eyes: kame strem
21-02-2020T02:10:34,Kameloh,hey trololo what's up :snail:

21-02-2020T02:11:04,Kameloh,you couuulld :eye:
21-02-2020T02:11:09,henner,"when i had stuff up on da i would get like 15 views and rarely one comment with a basic response like ""looks cool"" or something along those lines"
21-02-2020T02:12:02,Kameloh,that's how it usually is for most people when they're starting out in art
21-02-2020T02:12:06,Trololohstuffs,i wouldnt fret too much over what people think about your art especially since it can become a very unhealthy mindset to keep thinking about it
21-02-2020T02:12:16,Kameloh,yee ^
21-02-2020T02:13:54,w0lfmare,Unfortunately there's a vast sea of creators making art. You could be the best artist in the world and never be seen
21-02-2020T02:13:56,Trololohstuffs,at some point you might end up just doing art for views instead for fun
21-02-2020T02:14:11,w0lfmare,Reaching people in itself is a skill all its own

21-02-2020T02:26:32,henner,but like...
21-02-2020T02:27:28,henner,"my art is like mythology fantasy stuff with magic and dragons n stuff, but in the future, where that magic has been encorporated into very powerful machines"
21-02-2020T02:27:47,henner,and mech stuff i dont think is very popular
21-02-2020T02:28:18,Kameloh,"ahh, well I would say focus on things that you enjoy -- I wouldn't worry about what's popular"
21-02-2020T02:28:40,henner,i have never seen any actual proffessional artworks of a bio-mechanical dragon
21-02-2020T02:28:47,Kameloh,"like, don't create art just for page views unless that's your goal"
21-02-2020T02:28:57,SageSaga,i have seen that
21-02-2020T02:29:00,henner,i was looking all over and i found nothing
21-02-2020T02:30:07,henner,exept for one guy named hydrothrax who designed one with a gun in its head and now im obsessed with dragons and mythical creatures with machine guns and pulse gund and ammo belts inside their heads.... literally obsessed
21-02-2020T02:30:39,henner,"no i do it for a hobby cuz i liek it, but i also wish it got views"

21-02-2020T02:31:21,henner,but that was also a time when i wasnt that great
21-02-2020T02:31:21,Kameloh,just gotta figure out what works for you if that's your goal
21-02-2020T02:31:23,SageSaga,if you dont post it - it cant get views

21-02-2020T03:07:36,henner,does it have anything to do with truck tailgates or american flags?....*snrk*
21-02-2020T03:08:31,henner,ye ill put some stuff up on da tonight and see what happens
21-02-2020T03:10:50,SageSaga,it's tough getting noticed on a site like DA- im sure thats gotten worse since last time i used DA it probably had 10% of its current users
21-02-2020T03:11:26,Kameloh,"yee, that's why I put my art on like 6 different sites haha"
21-02-2020T03:12:04,henner,yea thats the thing i tend to steer clear of the big social media platforms like twitter and all that garbage
21-02-2020T03:12:20,Kameloh,I like twitter :cat:
21-02-2020T03:12:23,SageSaga,twitter is my favorite
21-02-2020T03:12:38,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Twitter is best, fallowed by DA imo"
21-02-2020T03:12:45,henner,-_-

21-02-2020T03:13:05,Kameloh,phallowed :snail:
21-02-2020T03:13:05,PurpleLemons,gotta play the game
21-02-2020T03:13:17,SageSaga,twitter doesnt leave room for people to post their work and go on a rant
21-02-2020T03:13:24,SageSaga,so it keeps it simple
21-02-2020T03:13:26,MarvTheHugPharaoh,^
21-02-2020T03:13:39,henner,i just dont like it because of how toxic all the platforms have become due to our current political situation we have goin on
21-02-2020T03:13:58,henner,i mean like twitter facebook instagram
21-02-2020T03:14:00,Kameloh,just gotta not pay attention to em :snail:
21-02-2020T03:14:01,SageSaga,"Facebook is trash =_= because i interacted so little on it- if i reply to anything on Facebook my entire ""Wall"" becomes whatever i respond to"
21-02-2020T03:14:13,JojoF2415,I like reading all the negative comments about tik tok on YouTube
21-02-2020T03:14:20,henner,i dont have accounts for any of them
21-02-2020T03:14:40,SageSaga,"it used to be ""oh a few friends said some cool things- im gonna reply to them-"" *replied to one- everything else vanishes and is replaced with all of that persons stuff*"
21-02-2020T03:14:41,BadFoMo,What about My Space?
21-02-2020T03:14:51,henner,oh yea i forgot that tiktok even exists

21-02-2020T03:15:09,JojoF2415,Tik tok is garbage
21-02-2020T03:15:16,SageSaga,but Bad- im not a Band
21-02-2020T03:15:19,JojoF2415,And overrated
21-02-2020T03:15:36,henner,i hardly even know how to use my smartphone i dont need all the media platforms and learning this new emoji language n all that
21-02-2020T03:15:55,SageSaga,i see funny things from Tiktok- once people i follow on Twitter filter it
21-02-2020T03:16:35,JojoF2415,The openings of re zero remind me so much of February and March of 2018
21-02-2020T03:16:58,BadFoMo,What is Tik Tok?

21-02-2020T03:17:57,henner,"funny thing about that, im an older teen/young adult and i dont hardly know how to use a smartphone......"
21-02-2020T03:18:03,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Kinda miss some vines like Daz Black

21-02-2020T03:19:52,henner,"id imagine that nobody of this generation would know anything about 80s trucks but they know everything about phones, not me im d uther way around bruh"
21-02-2020T03:20:00,SageSaga,it's killing my business- but thankfully my business is doing better than ever before atm
21-02-2020T03:20:45,w0lfmare,That's good Sage

21-02-2020T03:24:41,SageSaga,maybe i'll put an ad on it
21-02-2020T03:24:46,w0lfmare,"As it's still a smaller platform I'm getting really good cost per click, but i have to shop around for quantity"
21-02-2020T03:24:48,SageSaga,but ive always been bad at making ads XD

21-02-2020T16:22:59,Nekonny,"I want to do a bunch of cameos, but  I need to talk to the artists first"
21-02-2020T16:25:54,SageSaga,Picarto is terrible today
21-02-2020T16:27:10,Nekonny,are you going to try to reconnect?
21-02-2020T16:27:42,SageSaga,it's auto trying

21-02-2020T16:29:42,Nekonny,what will you be streaming?
21-02-2020T16:30:55,NibblyBot,New Comic Page: Party's Over http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/1096/

21-02-2020T16:32:42,Nekonny,reboot ?
21-02-2020T16:32:58,SageSaga,=_= how long have you been doing this Ron?
21-02-2020T16:33:35,SageSaga,gaaaaah- Restarting wont fix this- its a connection issue on the network to Picarto
21-02-2020T16:33:45,Nekonny,Sorry
21-02-2020T16:33:45,sunblaze,aww :(
21-02-2020T16:34:13,SageSaga,its not stopping at my pc- its not stopping at my router- its not stopping at my ISP - it's getting interrupted on the way to Picarto
21-02-2020T16:34:35,Nekonny,"Although in my experience, when stumped its worth trying even the things that would not seem to be the cause."
21-02-2020T16:34:52,SageSaga,only if you dont know the cause- i already did a trace on it
21-02-2020T16:35:26,Nekonny,thats where the frame drops are happening
21-02-2020T16:35:29,Nekonny,?
21-02-2020T16:35:32,Nekonny,lost packets?
21-02-2020T16:35:54,SageSaga,sorta- it can also be caused by the frames not being accepted by Picarto's servers
21-02-2020T16:36:35,SageSaga,usually lost packets will affect your internet- but i can watch your stream and i can hear my music being streamed
21-02-2020T16:36:38,Rosscoe,them frames be OP
21-02-2020T16:36:44,Mediawatcher,"That new page, where are they getting teleported to?"
21-02-2020T16:36:59,SageSaga,probably to a prep room or something
21-02-2020T16:37:23,SageSaga,Trace is probably needed for the process
21-02-2020T16:37:49,SageSaga,oooh or maybe an observation room - because hes a creep that likes to watch
21-02-2020T16:39:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I came in at the wrong time
21-02-2020T16:39:27,Nekonny,Thee holodeck experienced an error

21-02-2020T16:52:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"they wouldn‚Äôt mess it up, but the gerbils running everything in the system might"

21-02-2020T17:06:46,Chalodraws,Maty!
21-02-2020T17:07:05,MatyMaty,Chalo!
21-02-2020T17:07:20,SageSaga,"maty just kicks in the door today and says ""I dont like what you like!"""
21-02-2020T17:07:35,RimaDraws,lol
21-02-2020T17:07:41,Nekonny,"well, I figured taffy could be dropping off a sample of the new drink over at the cafe"
21-02-2020T17:07:47,Nekonny,although would they serve cider?
21-02-2020T17:07:49,Rosscoe,Ok now that the match is over gona go check on subbtitles
21-02-2020T17:07:51,Nekonny,XD
21-02-2020T17:09:14,Rosscoe,"Ah poo, no subtitles"
21-02-2020T17:09:31,SageSaga,of course not
21-02-2020T17:09:50,SageSaga,why would Japan bother putting English subs on their bluray?
21-02-2020T17:10:11,MatyMaty,"well there are ""international"" versions of some Blurays"
21-02-2020T17:10:16,MatyMaty,which have english
21-02-2020T17:10:21,Tharkis,Because USA is the second biggest market for them
21-02-2020T17:10:29,SageSaga,yeah but the US pays to get rights for that stuff
21-02-2020T17:10:34,SageSaga,and they did
21-02-2020T17:10:45,SageSaga,but they dropped it- so they still own those rights
21-02-2020T17:11:07,SageSaga,its like buying something and refusing to distribute it- to disrupt a market
21-02-2020T17:11:41,SageSaga,so you need to wait for someone else to get those rights and distribute it
21-02-2020T17:12:07,SageSaga,welcome to markets 101
21-02-2020T17:12:57,Nekonny,kije monkey island belongs to disney now
21-02-2020T17:12:59,MatyMaty,"Meh I do watch fansubs, but I buy the blurays of said show even if is just for collecting"
21-02-2020T17:13:05,Nekonny,so we'll never see a new game
21-02-2020T17:13:11,Nekonny,*like
21-02-2020T17:13:24,Nekonny,fansubs were the seed that started the market
21-02-2020T17:13:28,SageSaga,buying blurays doesnt work for me- i need digital copies or streaming services
21-02-2020T17:14:50,SageSaga,which is why i was so happy to see Ghibli finally going digital!
21-02-2020T17:14:55,SageSaga,except for the one movie i wanted!
21-02-2020T17:15:23,Nekonny,I was a bit upset that the ghibli museum sold out so quickly : (
21-02-2020T17:15:39,Chalodraws,yeaaah. but its OK
21-02-2020T17:15:47,Chalodraws,IM sure it will be fun regardless
21-02-2020T17:15:47,sunblaze,tell me about it. 1 week before I arrived in tokyo all gone :(
21-02-2020T17:16:09,Nekonny,sold out for the entire month hours after going on sale
21-02-2020T17:16:16,MatyMaty,when you guys go to Japan
21-02-2020T17:16:29,MatyMaty,I hope you find a way to try nyotaimori

21-02-2020T17:17:32,Nekonny,maty tricked me XD]
21-02-2020T17:17:39,MatyMaty,I didn'!
21-02-2020T17:17:50,Rosscoe,"I swear Nekonny will be like Jame's may's time in japan. ""lets get out of here! ITS PERVY!!!"""
21-02-2020T17:17:54,MatyMaty,"and lol, Sage"

21-02-2020T17:33:26,Nekonny,hahah sorry chalo
21-02-2020T17:33:41,Nekonny,I think I should avoid shading till I figure out more of the background

21-02-2020T17:34:22,MatyMaty,:o!

21-02-2020T17:35:02,MatyMaty,Taffy quit the farm and moved to Sandy's town
21-02-2020T17:35:30,MatyMaty,And Neko's Tina is now working at Las Lindas instead
21-02-2020T17:36:05,Rosscoe,"Mora : "" CONGRATS! Your the new farm cook!"""
21-02-2020T17:36:18,Rosscoe,"Tina: "" WOOOT!"" *Everything explodes*"
21-02-2020T17:36:56,Nekonny,XD
21-02-2020T17:37:03,Nekonny,"Oh ok, the story!"
21-02-2020T17:37:07,Nekonny,Um
21-02-2020T17:37:18,Nekonny,taffy is bringing samples to the cafe?
21-02-2020T17:37:36,Nekonny,perhaps sandy and taffy used to work at a bar together in the distant past?
21-02-2020T17:37:37,Chalodraws,OOh yeah. I see the cooler now
21-02-2020T17:37:43,MatyMaty,Do cafes sell beer? :O
21-02-2020T17:37:50,Nekonny,"well, anything is possible"
21-02-2020T17:37:51,SageSaga,the cider isnt alcohol free right? because i dont see a cafe serving alcohol-
21-02-2020T17:38:02,MatyMaty,cider?
21-02-2020T17:38:11,Nekonny,perhaps a alcohol free version?
21-02-2020T17:38:16,Nekonny,or just some for them to share?
21-02-2020T17:38:19,MatyMaty,Maybe
21-02-2020T17:38:39,Wingman,Nek! <3
21-02-2020T17:38:41,TerrificTwenty,Irish coffee maybe?
21-02-2020T17:38:43,Wingman,Maty! <3
21-02-2020T17:38:44,Wingman,Peeps! <3
21-02-2020T17:38:45,Nekonny,Wing!
21-02-2020T17:38:49,SageSaga,cafes generally dont serve alcohol- they need a special license
21-02-2020T17:38:51,MatyMaty,wingman!
21-02-2020T17:38:52,Nekonny,"ok, next one"

21-02-2020T17:39:43,Nekonny,probably just some for them to share
21-02-2020T17:39:47,Nekonny,hahahah
21-02-2020T17:39:48,Wingman,How goes you all?

21-02-2020T17:40:10,Rosscoe,"oh hum. Right, I need to use a older OBS clinet for now"
21-02-2020T17:41:38,SageSaga,=_= i setup another appointment with the doctor but they cant see me till March
21-02-2020T17:43:31,Rosscoe,"Doing better then me, I have to use a walk in and even then they dont show up for appointments"
21-02-2020T17:43:42,JojoF2415,I just beat Tartarus in practice mode. 1821 attempts with 43:36 minutes
21-02-2020T17:44:24,Chalodraws,"Taffy brought the sweet, super light flavors they have"
21-02-2020T17:44:37,SageSaga,"i wonder if my appointment message will get flagged because i said ""I just cant take the pain anymore"""
21-02-2020T17:44:56,Nekonny,flagged?
21-02-2020T17:45:28,Nekonny,and that sort of pain sounds like ER level stuff sage
21-02-2020T17:45:34,SageSaga,yeah- medical providers flag potential mental issues
21-02-2020T17:45:47,SageSaga,i cant afford the ER
21-02-2020T17:46:34,TerrificTwenty,Got any plans for more cafe videos?
21-02-2020T17:47:14,Rosscoe,"Hmm, looks like I can not get a previous version that I use to use of OBS."
21-02-2020T17:47:24,Rosscoe,Guess stream will wait till I upgrade the video card
21-02-2020T17:48:15,Nekonny,I want  to make more videos
21-02-2020T17:48:21,Nekonny,but I need scripts :(

21-02-2020T18:02:37,Rosscoe,Or am I thinking of something else
21-02-2020T18:02:57,Rosscoe,:ptv-confused: Leave it too Maty to lewd up the cafe for after hours
21-02-2020T18:03:06,TerrificTwenty,Nah. Just a disco ball and a sick stereo.
