03-11-2020T00:10:22,AspiringNoodle,*with the fiery rage of a thousand burning suns* N O .
03-11-2020T00:10:35,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,We basically have seen who’s won already. Idk why they still advertise
03-11-2020T00:10:53,AspiringNoodle,"I don't know at all, lol"

03-11-2020T00:11:31,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,Tell you that*
03-11-2020T00:12:34,AspiringNoodle,All I know is that voter turnout is apparently the highest it's ever been since 1908.
03-11-2020T00:12:53,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,"Yeah, cuz they threatened you with the ads"
03-11-2020T00:13:12,AspiringNoodle,"Also, some dude in the UK apparently bet $5M on Trump to win"
03-11-2020T00:13:26,AspiringNoodle,Either he's about to regret everything or he's gonna be stupidly rich.
03-11-2020T00:13:28,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,“Who you vote for is privet BUT if you vote is public information”
03-11-2020T00:13:53,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,“Your friends family and neighbors can look up your voting record”
03-11-2020T00:14:08,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,“Right after this election”
03-11-2020T00:14:19,CrRAR,"Oh yeah, vote turnout is super impressive especially when you consider about 75 million or so of the US population are kids under voting age."
03-11-2020T00:14:29,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,That’s why people voted right there
03-11-2020T00:16:53,SpazztasticKiwi,they voted because when his show got canceled nobody expected the annoying orange to take up politics
03-11-2020T00:17:02,SpazztasticKiwi,& now they’re sick of him
03-11-2020T00:17:18,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,"And, OMG. The political ads are gone from the top of YT"

03-11-2020T00:23:22,SpazztasticKiwi,I can’t tell if I’m back in the game since it’s been a week or it doesn’t count cause last time was a color round
03-11-2020T00:24:06,Dadrobit,"Winning a color keeps you out, winning a sketch does not."
03-11-2020T00:25:26,SpazztasticKiwi,well I didn’t even make a runner up so I’m clean
03-11-2020T00:26:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I feel there’s a tie between 3 ideas I’ve wrote down
03-11-2020T00:26:36,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,"Yeah, you didn’t win one"
03-11-2020T00:26:50,SpazztasticKiwi,another Sam & colin might be overkill
03-11-2020T00:27:41,SpazztasticKiwi,but reds not that popular & we’ve seen more than plenty of Nora....ok maybe there’s a 4 way
03-11-2020T00:27:51,SpazztasticKiwi,there’s also a Maeve one
