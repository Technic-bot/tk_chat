14-02-2020T00:52:17,Roughlandin,0/10 That steam should be forming a heart
14-02-2020T00:52:18,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,steamy hot cocoa <3
14-02-2020T00:52:19,Roughlandin,Unsubbed
14-02-2020T00:52:33,Roughlandin,jk btw
14-02-2020T00:52:35,FoxxTrotter,Lows in the 20's here overnight.
14-02-2020T00:52:37,Ordithus,:ptv-ohmy: steamy
14-02-2020T00:52:38,Mediawatcher,Man seeing all the little details that Tom adds is amazing
14-02-2020T00:52:42,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-adiracoin::moneybag:
14-02-2020T00:52:47,Roughlandin,Tom is master of detail
14-02-2020T00:53:02,Dadrobit,Master of de tail*
14-02-2020T00:53:18,Roughlandin,The water droplet effects on Defending the Boss the other week blew my mind
14-02-2020T00:53:46,Roughlandin,Then he outdoes himself with Phoenix Laura
14-02-2020T00:54:19,Roughlandin,Which I still say will be a hard sketch to top for the rest of the year
14-02-2020T00:54:36,Dadrobit,The year is young.
14-02-2020T00:54:37,Ordithus,There is a lot of the year left
14-02-2020T00:54:48,Roughlandin,Which is how good that sketch was
14-02-2020T00:54:54,Mediawatcher,"It’s only been two months, too soon to call ot"
14-02-2020T00:54:56,Mediawatcher,It
14-02-2020T00:54:59,Dadrobit,"You just wait, when I get my diplomatic Sythe mid-August..."
14-02-2020T00:55:11,Yack0,Hello
14-02-2020T00:55:15,CrRAR,hi
14-02-2020T00:55:16,Kameloh,just gonna get some snacks and then start with layer effects
14-02-2020T00:55:16,Zakuru,:eyes: oh?
14-02-2020T00:55:17,Dadrobit,o/ yack
14-02-2020T00:55:17,Mediawatcher,I’ve only gotten three sketches so far
14-02-2020T00:55:20,Ordithus,"poor robit, always in purgatory"
14-02-2020T00:55:26,Mediawatcher,All of them sythe maren related
14-02-2020T00:55:30,Dadrobit,C'est la vie
14-02-2020T00:55:46,MarvTheHugPharaoh,purgatory makes the sketches so much sweeter
14-02-2020T00:55:58,Dadrobit,Doesn't help that I miss a bunch of votes lol.
14-02-2020T00:55:58,Roughlandin,Got one on my second week at $10 tier. Probably blew my load too soon
14-02-2020T00:56:17,Mediawatcher,It took me half a year to get my first sketch
14-02-2020T00:56:20,Kameloh,:ckameloh-naokifood:
14-02-2020T00:56:25,Dadrobit,And the last one I got for Marv was doublely sweet :D
14-02-2020T00:56:27,Mediawatcher,Been here since June of last year
14-02-2020T00:56:40,Roughlandin,I meant exactly what I said Kameloh
14-02-2020T00:56:44,Roughlandin,Take it how you will
14-02-2020T00:57:12,Mediawatcher,Kind of sad how little Karen appears in sketches
14-02-2020T00:58:11,Roughlandin,"Karen's fine, but Maddie is kind of just... better Karen"
14-02-2020T00:58:12,Ordithus,yeah some characters don't get drawn enough
14-02-2020T00:58:28,KeefMcDerpface,"""Better Karen"" lol"
14-02-2020T00:58:31,Mediawatcher,I’m thinking of suggesting her more foten
14-02-2020T00:58:34,Roughlandin,Sorry not sorry
14-02-2020T00:58:42,Mediawatcher,Often
14-02-2020T00:58:46,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Kame, you talking Honna or Kisara?"
14-02-2020T00:58:57,AspiringNoodle,I want to see Karen and Maeve playing :ptv-hearts:
14-02-2020T00:59:04,Mediawatcher,Agreed
14-02-2020T00:59:14,Kameloh,wait what marv XD
14-02-2020T00:59:15,Roughlandin,Karen would go full big sister mode immediately
14-02-2020T00:59:16,KeefMcDerpface,I wouldn't mind that.
14-02-2020T00:59:25,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I might be confusion
14-02-2020T00:59:25,Dadrobit,"Was gonna complain about not enough diplomatic Sythe, but then I remembered diplomatic Sythe riding Nibs Akira style and I really can't ever complain ever again that was so good."
14-02-2020T00:59:38,Kameloh,I just got back with snacks :ckameloh-naokifood:
14-02-2020T00:59:42,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I miss read
14-02-2020T00:59:47,Kameloh,:ckameloh-naokieyebrowshak:
14-02-2020T00:59:49,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Dad you're welcome <3
14-02-2020T00:59:50,Roughlandin,Akira Sythe x Nibs was awesome
14-02-2020T00:59:56,Roughlandin,That lightning effect was fire
14-02-2020T01:00:09,Mediawatcher,They should really suggest Karen more oftne
14-02-2020T01:00:12,Mediawatcher,Often
14-02-2020T01:00:12,Dadrobit,<3
14-02-2020T01:01:03,Mediawatcher,"But enough of that, this is a cool stream"
14-02-2020T01:01:22,LauW,Snoots! Snoots everywhere!
14-02-2020T01:01:22,Dadrobit,"That was prophetic btw, Marv. Oreo totally fucked up one of my XLR's a few weeks back. Was almost angry with him"
14-02-2020T01:01:42,Roughlandin,"Not gonna lie. I have a file with like 15 sketch suggests, and I was trying to think of little drawn characters... And I kind of... forgot Karen... existed"
14-02-2020T01:01:45,Ordithus,How is Oreo
14-02-2020T01:02:09,Dadrobit,He's busy being a good boi most days.
14-02-2020T01:02:13,Ordithus,d'aww
14-02-2020T01:02:18,unsteddyphoenix,Very good
14-02-2020T01:02:29,Roughlandin,A boi is always good
14-02-2020T01:02:35,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I can tell puppy futures 0_0
14-02-2020T01:02:35,Roughlandin,This is known Khaleesi
14-02-2020T01:02:45,Mediawatcher,Which is odd considering she’s been appearing a lot in the main comic lately
14-02-2020T01:03:00,Roughlandin,Her and her magic bikini
14-02-2020T01:03:00,unsteddyphoenix,Idk he can sometimes be nastyboi
14-02-2020T01:03:08,Dadrobit,It was my fault for leaving it out. Just thank God he didn't get the mic.
14-02-2020T01:03:13,Roughlandin,Even nastybois are secret good bois
14-02-2020T01:03:29,KeefMcDerpface,"Tbh, I don't know anyone who is a Karen fan."
14-02-2020T01:03:42,Roughlandin,Karen is fine
14-02-2020T01:03:48,Roughlandin,She's just kind of... there
14-02-2020T01:03:59,Mediawatcher,I guess it’s because Madelyn and Maeve exist
14-02-2020T01:04:03,Ordithus,"Karen's not fuzzy, and she isn't shipped with Sythe."
14-02-2020T01:04:07,KeefMcDerpface,I guess so.
14-02-2020T01:04:13,Roughlandin,Karen doesn't need much
14-02-2020T01:04:14,Mediawatcher,Marens got her ship with sythe
14-02-2020T01:04:21,Ordithus,Maren's gotten a lot more attention because of that
14-02-2020T01:04:25,unsteddyphoenix,Karen looks like a tree
14-02-2020T01:04:32,Ordithus,Though half the time she's a cat
14-02-2020T01:04:34,Roughlandin,Karen is fiiiiiiine
14-02-2020T01:04:46,Dadrobit,Karen's just kind of an artifact of Tom's early writing.
14-02-2020T01:04:55,Roughlandin,She's a simple girl. She's mainly just happy to be included
14-02-2020T01:05:12,Roughlandin,"(Like I said, she's an alpha build of Maddie)"
14-02-2020T01:05:17,Mediawatcher,She’s a big sythe and maren supporter
14-02-2020T01:05:26,Roughlandin,She's support!
14-02-2020T01:05:29,Ordithus,She's been quite adorable recently
14-02-2020T01:05:32,Roughlandin,Everybody needs support!
14-02-2020T01:05:40,Roughlandin,Looking out for her sister
14-02-2020T01:05:41,Dadrobit,She was literally a cheerleader in a page.
14-02-2020T01:05:48,KeefMcDerpface,So she's secretly a TK fan and a shipper of Maren and Sythe.
14-02-2020T01:05:50,CrRAR,haha
14-02-2020T01:05:55,steelabjur,"Karen suffers from lack of exposure, imo, I think the most featured she's ever been in the comic was her short adventure with Maddie."
14-02-2020T01:06:11,Roughlandin,Even then she was just kind of... there
14-02-2020T01:06:16,Roughlandin,Which is fine
14-02-2020T01:06:16,Mediawatcher,I get the feeling bother and sythe will be heavily involved next chapter
14-02-2020T01:06:22,Dadrobit,Then there was that time she was unconscious.
14-02-2020T01:06:26,Mediawatcher,Both her and sythe will be heavily involved next chapter
14-02-2020T01:06:47,SageSaga,hmm my touch movement isnt working in clip-
14-02-2020T01:06:49,Mediawatcher,She’s definitely gonna be there to help her sister
14-02-2020T01:06:55,InTheLionsDen,She is too young to be given a lot of exposure.
14-02-2020T01:06:58,Roughlandin,Karen hears her sister is in trouble and goes secret super badass
14-02-2020T01:06:59,CrRAR,c:
14-02-2020T01:07:05,Ordithus,"Panel 3 there, Callum has looked Death in the eyes"
14-02-2020T01:07:08,Mediawatcher,I bet that’s what’s gonna happen
14-02-2020T01:07:21,Roughlandin,Rambo Karen powers activate
14-02-2020T01:07:30,Mediawatcher,I don’t see how she wouldn’t be involved
14-02-2020T01:07:37,Mediawatcher,It’s her sister for crying out loud!
14-02-2020T01:07:41,Roughlandin,She ties her bikini to her head like a bandana
14-02-2020T01:07:48,KeefMcDerpface,losl
14-02-2020T01:07:51,KeefMcDerpface,*lol
14-02-2020T01:08:42,Ordithus,demands more Sealeen
14-02-2020T01:08:47,AnuSekaniArt,Anyone here have the feeling where you want to do like 4 or 5 things all at once? XD
14-02-2020T01:08:59,KeefMcDerpface,"Sh*t, that's also true Ord."
14-02-2020T01:09:16,Mediawatcher,I want to see sealeen return
14-02-2020T01:09:26,Roughlandin,Are they even still a thing? They felt kind of bit character-y to me
14-02-2020T01:09:27,Mediawatcher,I wonder why bother her and landen are on the banner
14-02-2020T01:09:38,Mediawatcher,Bother her and landen are on the banner
14-02-2020T01:09:39,Dadrobit,"Anu, I call that my ""weekend"""
14-02-2020T01:09:45,AnuSekaniArt,XD
14-02-2020T01:09:57,Roughlandin,Yeah I guess they are on the banner
14-02-2020T01:09:57,AnuSekaniArt,Well I'm on my weekend and that's me right now :P
14-02-2020T01:09:57,Mediawatcher,I can’t say both her for some reason
14-02-2020T01:10:03,mingun,11:09
14-02-2020T01:10:09,Mediawatcher,Which confuses me considering how minor they are
14-02-2020T01:10:27,Roughlandin,The cast is getting pretty big...
14-02-2020T01:10:37,AnuSekaniArt,"Do I wanna write? Do I wanna sketch? Do I wanna play games? If so, what do I write, what do I sketch, what games do I play, etc? XD"
14-02-2020T01:10:47,Mediawatcher,Why sealeen and landen are on the banner is confusing
14-02-2020T01:10:48,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Sketch words
14-02-2020T01:10:48,Ordithus,The banner was made when they were featured
14-02-2020T01:10:53,Dadrobit,Weekdays are for earning a paycheck and school. Weekends are for literally everything else that I'd otherwise rather have a week to complete.
14-02-2020T01:10:55,Roughlandin,Remember that one time when Natani and Keith didn't feature in a panel for over a year?
14-02-2020T01:11:06,Mediawatcher,When was that?
14-02-2020T01:11:11,AspiringNoodle,What are weekends?
14-02-2020T01:11:11,Ordithus,Chapter 18
14-02-2020T01:11:33,Roughlandin,The time between them leaving Zen's room and arriving at the Oasis room took over a year of panels irl
14-02-2020T01:11:35,Ordithus,Hence Adira and Maeve as well
14-02-2020T01:12:08,Roughlandin,"True, but Natani and Keith are kind of the alt main characters"
14-02-2020T01:12:21,Roughlandin,(Honestly they have the better character arc)
14-02-2020T01:12:41,unsteddyphoenix,Man Kat fans know all about that life :/
14-02-2020T01:13:01,Roughlandin,"Oh yeah, she STILL hasn't had another panel"
14-02-2020T01:13:02,Dadrobit,"As a Keiren fan, tell me about it..."
14-02-2020T01:13:06,Roughlandin,Same with Zen
14-02-2020T01:13:16,AspiringNoodle,I spy a w0lf in chat... hi w0lf :ptv-hearts:
14-02-2020T01:13:23,TLDragon,"They certainly have had an interesting time of it, though there's certainly still more to Trace's arc, or maybe to this arc. Has he been on multiple arcs? I think so."
14-02-2020T01:13:27,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,Hi W0lf
14-02-2020T01:13:48,CompassArisen,maybe they are the less main chars than the Players moving the world forward
14-02-2020T01:13:48,Roughlandin,Trace is fine as a main character and I think his arc is REALLY about to heat up
14-02-2020T01:14:18,TLDragon,"poor Maren looks about to get caught up as a catalyst of some serious character development for Trace, yea"
14-02-2020T01:14:26,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-daydreamingkat::beer:
14-02-2020T01:14:26,Roughlandin,Considering we just found out old him was basically planning on using Maren as a human catalyst the whole time
14-02-2020T01:14:54,TLDragon,"Kat, I think, deserves better than she's getting, but the story isn't over yet, either."
14-02-2020T01:15:20,Dadrobit,"Trace suffered in terms of being a good main character for a long ass time. Up until he took a stand in Edinmire, it was really just him kinda running away and having the plot happen to him rather than him moving the plot."
14-02-2020T01:15:26,TLDragon,"(note, not a criticism of the story. :) )"
14-02-2020T01:15:43,Mediawatcher,"Let’s hope trace can save maren from her current ordeal, considering he caused it"
14-02-2020T01:16:01,TLDragon,"Where Kat's at makes sense, I just like her and want her to have... more, I guess."
14-02-2020T01:16:24,Twokinds,"Done with this one, for now"
14-02-2020T01:16:28,AnuSekaniArt,Decided I'd peruse an RPG manual I just got today for some story inspiration lol
14-02-2020T01:16:30,Ordithus,Is cute <3
14-02-2020T01:16:31,Roughlandin,Noice!
14-02-2020T01:16:32,TLDragon,gorgeous work!
14-02-2020T01:16:32,AnuSekaniArt,Oh nice work Tom! :D
14-02-2020T01:16:33,unsteddyphoenix,FOR NOW
14-02-2020T01:16:34,Dadrobit,"In terms of the Hero's Journey, Trace is still suuuuuper early in development."
14-02-2020T01:16:35,Mediawatcher,Nice job tom!
14-02-2020T01:16:38,KeefMcDerpface,Nice Tom.
14-02-2020T01:16:39,unsteddyphoenix,Nice work!
14-02-2020T01:16:40,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,great work Tom
14-02-2020T01:16:40,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Looking cute Tom
14-02-2020T01:16:47,Dadrobit,"Good stuff, Tom!"
14-02-2020T01:16:48,Roughlandin,Only 5000 more subtle effects to add!
14-02-2020T01:16:59,KeefMcDerpface,Only 5000
14-02-2020T01:16:59,starcat13,so nice!
14-02-2020T01:17:07,AspiringNoodle,...That pic is background material
14-02-2020T01:17:07,Roughlandin,Or so
14-02-2020T01:17:09,Mediawatcher,Well it’s tome for trace to take initiative and fix what  he’s done
14-02-2020T01:17:12,jirka,Very Nice Nora Card Tom
14-02-2020T01:17:15,Mediawatcher,It’s time
14-02-2020T01:17:24,Roughlandin,I'm calling this as Relax 2.0
14-02-2020T01:17:36,TLDragon,Seeing Tom's improvement makes me wonder where I'd be if I'd stuck with art
14-02-2020T01:17:51,Roughlandin,You'd be drawing
14-02-2020T01:17:55,Ordithus,":eyes: oooh lighting, it begins, Kame"
14-02-2020T01:17:58,KeefMcDerpface,Same place as Tom more or less.
14-02-2020T01:18:16,Kameloh,:ckameloh-naokibongoeyebro:
14-02-2020T01:18:24,Roughlandin,Two decades of constant drawing tends to make one better
14-02-2020T01:18:32,unsteddyphoenix,Is it still a sketch? :thinking:
14-02-2020T01:18:36,Roughlandin,Ah!
14-02-2020T01:18:39,KeefMcDerpface,Aw
14-02-2020T01:18:41,Kameloh,:ckameloh-kuvaeyes:
14-02-2020T01:18:42,KeefMcDerpface,Sad Rose
14-02-2020T01:18:45,Roughlandin,No sad Rose!
14-02-2020T01:18:50,KeefMcDerpface,:ptv-whiny:
14-02-2020T01:19:04,Ordithus,This is heartbreaking but so <3
14-02-2020T01:19:05,Roughlandin,Somebody punch Trace! That'll make her smile!
14-02-2020T01:19:15,Mediawatcher,Poor rose
14-02-2020T01:19:17,Roughlandin,Too many sad faces!
14-02-2020T01:19:23,PurpleLemons,it looked good Tom :thumbsup:
14-02-2020T01:20:50,PurpleLemons,Sage and Kame doing good stuff too :eyes:
14-02-2020T01:21:00,Roughlandin,Everybody doing good stuff
14-02-2020T01:21:03,unsteddyphoenix,And so is that purple guy!
14-02-2020T01:21:07,Dadrobit,"Fuck, I'm a barbarian. Just realized I have a drop of spicy mayo on my tie. BRB...."
14-02-2020T01:21:08,AnuSekaniArt,Don't sell yourself short Purp :P
14-02-2020T01:21:15,AnuSekaniArt,Y'all are rocking it tonight <3
14-02-2020T01:21:19,Roughlandin,Dad no! Not the tie!
14-02-2020T01:21:20,Kameloh,thanks! you're all doing great :cat:
14-02-2020T01:21:28,Ordithus,Wonderful art all around
14-02-2020T01:21:39,Roughlandin,"Everybody on stream is doing great! You too, chat!"
14-02-2020T01:21:42,maku450,"indeed, very good stuff :eyes:"
14-02-2020T01:21:43,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,YOU ARE ALL AWESOME
14-02-2020T01:21:53,Mediawatcher,Everyone here is doing great
14-02-2020T01:21:53,Roughlandin,Except Dad. Bad dad. Go get a Tide Pen!
14-02-2020T01:21:56,KeefMcDerpface,"No, you're awesome."
14-02-2020T01:21:59,unsteddyphoenix,Except that one guy
14-02-2020T01:22:02,unsteddyphoenix,Hate that guy
14-02-2020T01:22:13,Roughlandin,Don't be that guy
14-02-2020T01:22:15,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,NO YOUR AWESOME!!
14-02-2020T01:23:11,AspiringNoodle,Oh no... not this pic... I read too many sad comics earlier today...
14-02-2020T01:23:15,Roughlandin,"Saria, Laura, and Alaric are having such awesome adventures together in Ghostworld"
14-02-2020T01:23:28,AspiringNoodle,I'll be back in like 30 min when it's way further along xD
14-02-2020T01:23:31,TLDragon,I got the *nicest* compliment today.
14-02-2020T01:23:52,Roughlandin,You're beautiful! ...Was that nicer?
14-02-2020T01:24:48,Roughlandin,"Also, can we get another AU of Saria, Laura, and Alaric having ghost shenanigans?"
14-02-2020T01:24:57,TLDragon,"nah, ""you have really great characters, they're just inspiring."""
14-02-2020T01:25:22,Roughlandin,"Well you do. I don't know them, but you do"
14-02-2020T01:25:57,TLDragon,"Purp has drawn the two characters they were talking about, he could say if that's true."
14-02-2020T01:26:47,Roughlandin,No need to verify. I believe you lol!
14-02-2020T01:27:52,Roughlandin,Jeez this sketch is making me legitimately tear up and it isn't even done yet
14-02-2020T01:28:23,Mediawatcher,How heartbreaking for both Saria and rose
14-02-2020T01:28:43,Roughlandin,Old Trace was a bastard man
14-02-2020T01:29:06,Ordithus,Trace's heart broke so he broke the world :ctwokinds-sadtrace2:
14-02-2020T01:29:57,MarvTheHugPharaoh,As one does
14-02-2020T01:29:59,TLDragon,he wouldn't be the first person to do that.
14-02-2020T01:30:06,Roughlandin,"Man, he REALLy appreciated Saria... once she died."
14-02-2020T01:30:41,CrimsonHelsing,More like his appreciation turned to obsession once she died
14-02-2020T01:30:58,Dadrobit,"Alright, back. And slightly cleaner..."
14-02-2020T01:31:02,Ordithus,wb
14-02-2020T01:31:11,KeefMcDerpface,"Trace: ""Wolves killed my wife, all wolves shall pay."""
14-02-2020T01:31:16,KeefMcDerpface,wb Dad
14-02-2020T01:31:25,Roughlandin,He appreciated her so much when she was alive that he left her alone for month's at a time
14-02-2020T01:31:38,Mediawatcher,And now marens paying for his obsession
14-02-2020T01:31:55,Ordithus,"<3 Maren, <3 Saria"
14-02-2020T01:32:01,Ordithus,This comic is gonna get weird for me
14-02-2020T01:32:22,Roughlandin,:heart:
14-02-2020T01:32:32,Roughlandin,Everybody but Old Trace
14-02-2020T01:32:36,Mediawatcher,"Oh boy I feel so frightened for maren right now, I worry if she’ll even make it out alive"
14-02-2020T01:32:43,Roughlandin,She will
14-02-2020T01:32:45,Mediawatcher,Screw you old trace
14-02-2020T01:32:46,Roughlandin,...Maybe
14-02-2020T01:32:52,Roughlandin,...Hopefully
14-02-2020T01:33:24,Dadrobit,"Weird is in dadaism? Or weird as in a girlfriend telling you she wants to try something ""different"" tonight weird?"
14-02-2020T01:33:29,Dadrobit,As in*
14-02-2020T01:33:35,Ordithus,Weird as in one waifu possessing the other
14-02-2020T01:33:58,Ordithus,So... the latter? :ctwokinds-floraquestion:
14-02-2020T01:34:34,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I'm just gonna put that under ""mix of both""."
14-02-2020T01:35:00,Mediawatcher,Ok obviously it’s unlikely maren will meet her end here but it still is unnerving seeing her get caught in traces mess
14-02-2020T01:35:19,Roughlandin,The worst part is knowing this is what he planned for her the whole time
14-02-2020T01:35:37,Roughlandin,"Like, she thought they were in a legitimate relationship"
14-02-2020T01:35:57,Roughlandin,And the whole time he was planning on sacrificing her because she looks kind of like his dead wife
14-02-2020T01:35:57,steelabjur,@Ordithus Something like this? https://www.deviantart.com/twokinds/art/Clumsy-Ghost-Laura-758971738
14-02-2020T01:36:37,Ordithus,I suppose.  That would confuse Keith so much
14-02-2020T01:36:40,Mediawatcher,I think she knew it wasn’t serious
14-02-2020T01:36:59,Mediawatcher,But that doesn’t make the situation any less uncomfortable
14-02-2020T01:37:01,Roughlandin,Yeah but I doubt she knew it'd end with her dead and someone else in her body
14-02-2020T01:37:24,Roughlandin,Kinda puts a damper on the whole little fling
14-02-2020T01:37:39,Mediawatcher,And she was just about to start another one with sythe
14-02-2020T01:38:06,Roughlandin,Hero Sythe to the rescue!
14-02-2020T01:38:15,Mediawatcher,I mean didn’t tom clarify something things in that stream? Also Karen to the rescue
14-02-2020T01:38:20,KeefMcDerpface,*Nibs steals the show.
14-02-2020T01:38:32,Mediawatcher,Nibs will definitely be happy though
14-02-2020T01:38:43,Mediawatcher,No one takes her wolf
14-02-2020T01:38:51,Roughlandin,Yeah a few streams ago Tom mentioned Trace was planning that for Maren the whole time
14-02-2020T01:38:52,Dadrobit,She might not have died. Coulda been something like Robert Heinlein's I Will Fear No Evil.
14-02-2020T01:39:19,Mediawatcher,He also said some about being impatient about 4 pages ago
14-02-2020T01:39:24,Ordithus,Trace doesn't know what he's missing
14-02-2020T01:39:36,Roughlandin,Trace didn't know what he had to begin with
14-02-2020T01:39:38,Dadrobit,"Amnesia will do that, Ord."
14-02-2020T01:39:38,Mediawatcher,Cause there was someone ranting
14-02-2020T01:40:05,Roughlandin,I vaguely remember this
14-02-2020T01:40:15,Mediawatcher,I have screenshots of what he said
14-02-2020T01:40:17,Roughlandin,I feel like the pace of the comic is about to pick up fast
14-02-2020T01:40:26,Dadrobit,"I missed something? Trace is impatient, or Tom?"
14-02-2020T01:40:38,Roughlandin,Mediawatcher watching that media
14-02-2020T01:40:38,Ordithus,I don't think we need a replay of someone being pissy
14-02-2020T01:40:53,Mediawatcher,Eh I don’t want to talk about it anymore
14-02-2020T01:40:54,Roughlandin,I remember it being pretty pissy
14-02-2020T01:41:03,Roughlandin,And I'm fine not reliving it
14-02-2020T01:41:20,Mediawatcher,all I’ll say is I saw a lot of people angry when that page went up
14-02-2020T01:41:28,Ordithus,"Anyways, how bout that durgon"
14-02-2020T01:41:31,Dadrobit,Tom has the patience of a saint to deal with sitting at a table at cons.
14-02-2020T01:41:43,PurpleLemons,:cpurplelemons-tired: layers kill my lemon brain time to try and work on comms

14-02-2020T01:42:13,Mediawatcher,I’d like to see him at a comic con at some point
14-02-2020T01:42:24,Dadrobit,I can't even imagine how many folks try to screw with him and/or squeeze him for info there...
14-02-2020T01:42:44,Roughlandin,He needs to bring a real life banhammer with him
14-02-2020T01:42:49,Roughlandin,For people who annoy him

14-02-2020T01:52:06,Dadrobit,Maybe a bit higher.

14-02-2020T01:54:29,AspiringNoodle,Ooooooooord :ptv-excited:
14-02-2020T01:54:44,Roughlandin,People are cold. Old Trace is still a jerk
14-02-2020T01:55:22,Mediawatcher,"I think calling old trace a jerk is an understatment, he was a monster"
14-02-2020T01:55:41,Mediawatcher,Understatement
14-02-2020T01:55:41,Dadrobit,I simply fear that our tryst with the oil slicked Twister will end in freezerburn.
14-02-2020T01:55:43,Roughlandin,Yeah that. I wanted to call him something else but I think cursing in bannable
14-02-2020T01:55:52,Ordithus,Older old Trace was merely a slightly racist guy
14-02-2020T01:56:04,Roughlandin,Uh. Pretty racist
14-02-2020T01:56:05,Mediawatcher,Who killed thousands of wolves
14-02-2020T01:56:13,Roughlandin,Even before that
14-02-2020T01:56:13,Dadrobit,"Don't fuckin curse in here, this is a holy Buddhist chat!"
14-02-2020T01:56:15,Ordithus,"No, that was less old Trace"
14-02-2020T01:56:25,Mediawatcher,And nearly destroyed the basitin race
14-02-2020T01:56:30,Roughlandin,Old Old Trace still kind of ran a Slave State
14-02-2020T01:57:32,Ordithus,Old old Trace was busy trying to impress a girl by fighting a dragon
14-02-2020T01:57:54,Dadrobit,"Old old Trace was still a super ass. Dude referenced Keidrans as an ""it"" and was so pro-slavery that he argued for it so loudly with his wife the whole town could hear."
14-02-2020T01:57:55,Mediawatcher,And only won her over by talking
14-02-2020T01:57:58,Roughlandin,A dragon who he was also a jerk to
14-02-2020T01:57:59,steelabjur,"""fighting"""
14-02-2020T01:58:28,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Old trace is proof that dogs make the best people
14-02-2020T01:58:38,Roughlandin,Also kept his wife hidden away in the manor like a possession. Along with Rose... who was literally his possession
14-02-2020T01:58:56,Roughlandin,Dude was kind of a dick
14-02-2020T01:59:01,Roughlandin,Even before the genocide
14-02-2020T02:00:13,Mediawatcher,And planned to use maren as a sacrifice to bring back saria
14-02-2020T02:00:36,Roughlandin,And gave Karen ears for annoying him... even though she liked that
14-02-2020T02:00:53,Mediawatcher,And worst of all cockblocked sythe
14-02-2020T02:00:57,Mediawatcher,His worst act
14-02-2020T02:01:01,Ordithus,"That was new old Trace, the eeeeevil one"
14-02-2020T02:01:11,steelabjur,Kind of makes you wonder how he would have turned out if he didn't have the gift of magic. How much of his attitude was upbringing with the Templars?
14-02-2020T02:01:29,Mediawatcher,I get the feeling well soon find out
14-02-2020T02:01:38,Roughlandin,"Like I said, Old Old was still a slave-owning asshate who used everyone around him like stepping stones to get what he wanted"
14-02-2020T02:01:43,Ordithus,Old old Trace managed to charm Saria <3
14-02-2020T02:01:52,Roughlandin,A devious asshat
14-02-2020T02:02:06,Roughlandin,New Old also managed to charm Maren
14-02-2020T02:02:16,Roughlandin,Being charming doesn't make you not a huge dick
14-02-2020T02:02:19,CrimsonHelsing,"A great burden to attone for, even as the man he is now. Going to be difficult, especially now that he has a family of keidran, which is a clear cut sign of a different man than before, if anyone in Mekkan would take the pain to look carefully. *Ahem*"
14-02-2020T02:02:21,Ordithus,not... a good look for Maren
14-02-2020T02:02:24,CrimsonHelsing,But I digress

14-02-2020T02:04:16,Twokinds,Must be doing too much art

14-02-2020T02:52:40,Ordithus,too much powah :ctwokinds-power:
14-02-2020T02:53:12,JojoF2415,I did Electrolux in practice mode
14-02-2020T02:55:03,JojoF2415,1316 attempts 1543 jumps Time 34:04. I was laughing due to the fact that the ending I received was reversed which isn’t supposed to happen
14-02-2020T02:56:25,JojoF2415,I just uploaded my kathrine fan art. I hope I don’t get attacked by furry haters
14-02-2020T03:03:06,henner,jojo where can i see ur fanart bro?
14-02-2020T03:04:41,AspiringNoodle,*yawn*
14-02-2020T03:04:52,AspiringNoodle,And so begins the long painful process of simming my new spec...
14-02-2020T03:05:02,AspiringNoodle,"I should get a raidbots sub, lol"
14-02-2020T03:05:23,henner,lol
14-02-2020T03:06:04,AspiringNoodle,"Not even joking, you can use their site for free, but premium has lots of benefits"
14-02-2020T03:06:29,henner,wait what is raidbot?
14-02-2020T03:06:31,AspiringNoodle,Like the ability to sim azerite essences in the browser without needing to do a bunch of switcheroos and copy / paste of data from the addon
14-02-2020T03:06:33,henner,some hack?
14-02-2020T03:06:49,AspiringNoodle,Simming site for WoW
14-02-2020T03:06:57,henner,no idea what that is
14-02-2020T03:07:05,AspiringNoodle,"More or less ""If I switch to this gear / talent, how will my DPS / HPS change?"""
14-02-2020T03:07:20,henner,ah
14-02-2020T03:07:28,AspiringNoodle,"If you use it for free, you have to wait in a queue and your sims are limited in several ways"
14-02-2020T03:07:38,AspiringNoodle,"Like it only being able to try out 300,000 combinations"
14-02-2020T03:08:23,AspiringNoodle,"You can't sim essences in the browser (workaround is do quick sims, but paste the simc addon info with your different essence loadouts)"
14-02-2020T03:08:42,AspiringNoodle,And your sims can only run on a maximum of 32 cores
14-02-2020T03:10:59,AspiringNoodle,10 min later and my first sim is now 90% done
14-02-2020T03:11:12,AspiringNoodle,"Oh boy, gonna be a fun night, maybe I should save it for the morning! lol"
14-02-2020T03:11:43,henner,so is the game still populated or is it dying like ppl say it is?
14-02-2020T03:13:11,AspiringNoodle,"It got pretty bad, but it's starting to recover"
14-02-2020T03:13:23,AspiringNoodle,Definitely helps that Ion FINALLY admitted that the team effed up
14-02-2020T03:13:43,henner,wait wut
14-02-2020T03:13:46,AspiringNoodle,"Only took subs dipping to unprecedented lows and people raging at the company for several expansions, but he FINALLY admitted it"
14-02-2020T03:13:53,AspiringNoodle,He's the lead developer for WoW
14-02-2020T03:14:04,henner,like i said i havent been online since august
14-02-2020T03:14:20,AspiringNoodle,"I think he's originally from the Diablo team, along with a bunch of other devs"
14-02-2020T03:14:36,AspiringNoodle,"When they were moved to WoW, they brought some of the Diablo design philosophy with them, and it's backfired massively"
14-02-2020T03:15:13,AspiringNoodle,"Diablo design works for DIABLO, WoW is a whole 'nother beast.  The game is already massive and grindy and time consuming as it is."
14-02-2020T03:15:37,AspiringNoodle,"And with a whole bunch of other things included, the last thing it needs is more rng and grind that's designed more for single player top-down dungeon crawlers"
14-02-2020T03:15:55,henner,yea they need to do some MAJOR work to the game
14-02-2020T03:16:24,henner,updating it with stunning graphics and character models is not gonna cut it
14-02-2020T03:16:47,henner,i mean yea i LOVE graphics.... im practically obsessed with them
14-02-2020T03:17:13,henner,but they need to do major work to the player interface and overall gameplay
14-02-2020T03:17:42,henner,"story is great, graphics are good, but the old 2004 game build is holding the game back so much"
14-02-2020T03:18:15,henner,and adding new systems like raid finder and upgradeable gear and new grinding systems just isnt gonna work
14-02-2020T03:20:25,JojoF2415,12 am dank memes
14-02-2020T03:20:33,henner,?
14-02-2020T03:20:39,henner,where is ur fanart?
14-02-2020T03:21:21,JojoF2415,Do I give the link?
14-02-2020T03:21:40,AspiringNoodle,"So, the engine definitely needs more work (my new computer tanked to 60 - 70 fps in some quests)"
14-02-2020T03:21:48,AspiringNoodle,But the gameplay is definitely reverting back a smidge
14-02-2020T03:22:22,AspiringNoodle,"Part of their admission was that they went too far with trimming.  And they also keep giving us temporary stuff every single expansion, instead of adding to our spellbooks"
14-02-2020T03:22:31,JojoF2415,I’ve been playing Minecraft all morning
14-02-2020T03:22:37,AspiringNoodle,I have yet to buy that
14-02-2020T03:22:58,henner,hmm
14-02-2020T03:23:06,henner,yea u didnt give the link
14-02-2020T03:23:20,henner,also recently i picked minecraft back up
14-02-2020T03:23:26,henner,havent played it in years
14-02-2020T03:23:39,AspiringNoodle,"WoW is really fun for me, personally"
14-02-2020T03:23:45,AspiringNoodle,I'm just a huge rpg nut :P
14-02-2020T03:24:03,AspiringNoodle,"Hell, if I ever stop playing this thing like someone on the verge of addiction, I bought the last SAO game that came out"
14-02-2020T03:24:12,JojoF2415,I cried playing geometry dash
14-02-2020T03:24:28,JojoF2415,97% fails are so painful
14-02-2020T03:24:51,SpazztasticKiwi,night Tom
14-02-2020T03:25:02,JojoF2415,It also makes you nervous which increases heart rate
14-02-2020T03:25:12,SpazztasticKiwi,by the time I realized I was distracted
14-02-2020T03:25:16,SpazztasticKiwi,stream done
14-02-2020T03:25:18,henner,"i got inspired by some creative builder guy on youtube and i got inspired to make a mansion mainly inspired by the legacy estate, but then i got even more inspired by the surrounding terrain and now im building and expanding it to a whole map"
14-02-2020T03:25:41,henner,heavily inspired by the alliance buildings in WoW and warcraft 3
14-02-2020T03:26:05,JojoF2415,I got the link. It was just simple tk fan art

14-02-2020T03:31:03,JojoF2415,I take too long. Double the time
14-02-2020T03:31:29,henner,oh it takes me 10+ hours for a piece of digital art
14-02-2020T03:31:33,JojoF2415,I’m not a huge fan of making digital art
14-02-2020T03:31:39,henner,ye
14-02-2020T03:31:49,henner,i have some twokinds fanart
14-02-2020T03:32:07,henner,"its a little older, not a perfect reflection of what i can do currently"
14-02-2020T03:32:43,henner,but ive learned from twokinds
14-02-2020T03:32:56,henner,you can see it reflects on my artstyle
14-02-2020T03:33:14,JojoF2415,I’ve only been drawing for less than 4 years
14-02-2020T03:33:23,henner,i learned lineart and backgrounds from watching these streams
14-02-2020T03:33:37,henner,ive been drawing my entire life
14-02-2020T03:33:38,JojoF2415,I’m mostly self taught
14-02-2020T03:33:41,henner,same
14-02-2020T03:34:06,henner,i was drawing 3 dimensional cars when i was 6 years old
14-02-2020T03:34:21,JojoF2415,Not mostly. Art class is boring and it’s showing me stuff I learned already
14-02-2020T03:34:59,henner,come 17 im drawing art that looks as good as toms work
14-02-2020T03:35:06,henner,ive never taken an art class.

14-02-2020T03:38:05,AspiringNoodle,"Just a matter of getting my gaming under control, as well as my other media consumption.  Some days it feels like just completely quitting Youtube would do me some good"
14-02-2020T03:38:14,JojoF2415,I just turned 15
14-02-2020T03:38:17,henner,oh yea also i started digital art in may this year

14-02-2020T03:38:40,henner,fast learner
14-02-2020T03:38:53,JojoF2415,I made that drawing when I was still 14
14-02-2020T03:38:59,henner,ah
14-02-2020T03:39:03,AspiringNoodle,"I'm starting to wonder if I'm relapsing into WoW, lol"

14-02-2020T03:39:24,henner,i honestly dont know when im gonna pick it back up
14-02-2020T03:39:25,AspiringNoodle,"If my minor in art says anything, I can improve"
14-02-2020T03:39:27,AspiringNoodle,fast
14-02-2020T03:39:30,JojoF2415,I also got a real life snow leopard drawing I made. I just uploaded it

14-02-2020T03:40:42,henner,oh yea btw i made a sketch of chimera
14-02-2020T03:40:42,JojoF2415,I just started deviant art yesterday
14-02-2020T03:41:05,JojoF2415,Well Thursday
14-02-2020T03:41:15,JojoF2415,I forgot it’s Saturday
14-02-2020T03:41:25,henner,idk how people would react to the sketch i did
14-02-2020T03:41:31,henner,probably be mad at me
14-02-2020T03:42:17,JojoF2415,My snow leopard. I actually had a fractured collar bone when I made this. I was in pain
14-02-2020T03:42:59,JojoF2415,I heard it crack. It was the worst pain I ever felt
14-02-2020T03:43:39,AspiringNoodle,*just realized now would be a great time to knock out some youtube videos*
14-02-2020T03:43:42,JojoF2415,Of course I endured the pain due to how stubborn I am. In the end I couldn’t take the pain any longer
14-02-2020T03:43:44,AspiringNoodle,simming takes FOREVER
14-02-2020T03:43:52,AspiringNoodle,Did you pass out mid-draw?

14-02-2020T03:45:36,AspiringNoodle,But seeing this art makes me hope for UBI in the future
14-02-2020T03:45:57,AspiringNoodle,People being able to pursue the arts as a career has the potential to help society so much
14-02-2020T03:46:47,JojoF2415,Guitar ya verifico Electrolux

14-02-2020T04:20:57,AspiringNoodle,"Also can confirm the advice from icy veins, so tomorrow is more or less finish setting up action bars, practice rotation for a bit, and then go out and have some fun!"
14-02-2020T04:21:32,AspiringNoodle,*sigh*
14-02-2020T04:21:53,AspiringNoodle,"I miss the days when it was easy to determine your ""best in slot"" pieces and just go through a checklist..."
14-02-2020T04:22:09,AspiringNoodle,Now with all the RNG you need to run these stupid simulations to see if it's an upgrade or not.
14-02-2020T04:22:40,AspiringNoodle,Because it turns out that one piece of gear I wasn't interested in was a 10% boost to dps

14-02-2020T14:56:14,AspiringNoodle,"Historically, consoles have been at the same level or higher than equivalent gaming pcs, and for the same or better price"
14-02-2020T14:56:44,AspiringNoodle,"Ofc, this advantage dries up since PC hardware is constantly evolving and improving over time between console releases, so those edges typically only last a few months"
14-02-2020T14:57:11,AspiringNoodle,"(Console still a great overall value tho, pc master race, y u so expensive? ;_:)"
14-02-2020T14:57:21,CrRAR,"yeah, but PC capability far outclasses a console."
14-02-2020T14:57:32,AspiringNoodle,But the PS5 has some PRETTY ballsy claims about its performance
14-02-2020T14:57:50,AspiringNoodle,"We'll know eventually once it's released, same with the next-gen Xbox."
14-02-2020T14:57:58,BadFoMo,@CrRAR And that is why I am with the PC Master Race.
14-02-2020T14:58:06,CrRAR,\o/
14-02-2020T14:58:14,CrRAR,Thing that sucks is a lot of development has been focused on optimizing game engines for consoles because they're the mainstream
14-02-2020T14:58:15,AspiringNoodle,So it's entirely possible that these next gen consoles will more or less be super powerful computers with custom OS's
14-02-2020T14:58:31,CrRAR,yeah
14-02-2020T14:58:32,AspiringNoodle,"Btw, next gen Xbox will more or less be a PC"
14-02-2020T14:58:36,CrRAR,yeah
14-02-2020T14:58:51,CrRAR,OG xbox was a PIII PC.
14-02-2020T14:58:58,CrRAR,aka Pentium 3
14-02-2020T14:59:22,CrRAR,360 had IBM PowerPC (wht it had the heat issue tbh)
14-02-2020T14:59:35,BadFoMo,The only reason for me to get a console is for consloe exclusev games. Like Saints Row (the first one)
14-02-2020T14:59:38,CrRAR,that's why apple switched away from PowerPC processors
14-02-2020T14:59:43,CrRAR,yeah
14-02-2020T14:59:45,BadFoMo,*.
14-02-2020T14:59:57,CrRAR,Gotta chase the originality.
14-02-2020T14:59:58,AspiringNoodle,Xbox is looking to have no exclusives next gen
14-02-2020T15:00:05,CrRAR,That's dumb
14-02-2020T15:00:12,CrRAR,cept Halo maybe?
14-02-2020T15:00:17,AspiringNoodle,Doubt it
14-02-2020T15:00:24,AspiringNoodle,They don't want ANY exclusives
14-02-2020T15:00:52,AspiringNoodle,"More game sales, potential lots of goodwill with the gaming community"
14-02-2020T15:00:56,CrRAR,Probably because they've become so bad at them xD
14-02-2020T15:00:56,AspiringNoodle,Could be a big-brain play
14-02-2020T15:01:13,CrRAR,Sony had the originality this past generation totally

14-02-2020T15:01:37,AspiringNoodle,There's rumors floating around that the PS5 will have microtransactions

14-02-2020T15:04:56,CrRAR,ah
14-02-2020T15:05:31,AspiringNoodle,They also pushed hard for crossplay this gen (even though they were dicks about it in the 360 / ps3 days)
14-02-2020T15:05:39,SageSaga,hmmmmmm- its still going red
14-02-2020T15:05:45,AspiringNoodle,And sony seems to be the only one not playing ball these days
14-02-2020T15:07:09,AspiringNoodle,"So who knows, maybe in the future games exclusivity will be a thing of the present"
14-02-2020T15:07:42,AspiringNoodle,And the only exception might be Nintendo because their games generally aren't that demanding and they typically make great consoles

14-02-2020T15:14:49,SageSaga,yeah its my connection to picarto- my net is fine
14-02-2020T15:15:12,SageSaga,nothing i can do but hope they start routing my traffic better
14-02-2020T15:15:19,CrRAR,"I don't understand that, such a weird problem for just you to have."
14-02-2020T15:15:25,CrRAR,yeah
14-02-2020T15:15:40,SageSaga,its probably not just me
14-02-2020T15:15:55,CrRAR,yeah probably in that general vicinity
14-02-2020T15:15:58,SageSaga,anyone who is being routed from my area probably also has the issue
14-02-2020T15:16:09,TeapotOfDoom,i wonder where the actual problem lies
14-02-2020T15:16:19,TeapotOfDoom,some isps pgp acting up
14-02-2020T15:16:22,SageSaga,between here and there
14-02-2020T15:16:31,CrRAR,"""f this particular region in particular"""
14-02-2020T15:16:39,TeapotOfDoom,over there in particula
14-02-2020T15:17:02,CrRAR,Weird that it is inconsistently inconsistent.
14-02-2020T15:17:11,CrRAR,Maybe traffic congestion.
14-02-2020T15:17:11,SageSaga,i can run a trace and try to find where the connection is slowing but it doesnt really do any good
14-02-2020T15:17:23,CrRAR,mmm
14-02-2020T15:17:43,CrRAR,Would changing DNS lookup server possibly help?
14-02-2020T15:18:07,SageSaga,no
14-02-2020T15:18:17,CrRAR,Though it won't matter if it trys the same server
14-02-2020T15:18:46,CrRAR,Just wondering if somehow a different picarto server may exist and routing to that would be better somehow.
14-02-2020T15:18:53,AspiringNoodle,Imagine if ISPs were required to let other companies use the infrastructure they put down
14-02-2020T15:19:11,AspiringNoodle,"Instead of saying, ""No, it's MY [taxpayer-funded] cable, only I can use it!"""
14-02-2020T15:19:36,AspiringNoodle,"...Nah, that's be way too consumer friendly and create actual competition."
14-02-2020T15:20:05,TeapotOfDoom,"this is not a dns problem, it's a routing issue"
14-02-2020T15:20:16,CrRAR,no i know
14-02-2020T15:20:40,CrRAR,I was just wondering if a different DNS might have a different entry for lookup or something
14-02-2020T15:20:42,TeapotOfDoom,i know of only one ISP who let's you dabble with PGP access
14-02-2020T15:21:19,CrRAR,"You can configure in many routhers what your network looks to for DNS, there's lots out there google has its own. 8.8.8.8"
14-02-2020T15:21:44,CrRAR,"Typically, yes, using your ISP's is ideal cuz it should be the closest."
14-02-2020T15:21:48,TeapotOfDoom,only that would enable you to change something. but as long as you know what you're doing and you don't have a straight up bottle neck something like this should not happen in the first place
14-02-2020T15:22:20,TeapotOfDoom,nah dns are normally synced
14-02-2020T15:22:23,CrRAR,"yeah, just useful for troubleshooting."
14-02-2020T15:22:31,CrRAR,OpenDNS is another big one.
14-02-2020T15:22:49,TeapotOfDoom,still as long as lookup works it won't change anything
14-02-2020T15:23:12,CrRAR,"...but yeah if Picarto's infrastructure is borked, won't change anything."
14-02-2020T15:23:46,TeapotOfDoom,i don't think it's picarto
14-02-2020T15:24:13,AspiringNoodle,I still have a natural suspicion of all ISPs xD
14-02-2020T15:24:18,CrRAR,lol
14-02-2020T15:24:33,CrRAR,That's mostly the reason to use a different DNS.
14-02-2020T15:24:40,AspiringNoodle,"My family uses Verizon, and it's working great!  But I still have suspicions"
14-02-2020T15:24:50,SageSaga,o_O the stream is that delayed? or did it just start showing stuff i did forever ago-
14-02-2020T15:25:07,AspiringNoodle,"I wouldn't know, it decides to buffer every half second, lmao"

14-02-2020T16:17:31,AspiringNoodle,We had one of those places a few years ago

14-02-2020T16:19:43,AspiringNoodle,"They had a small building where you actually ate, it was pretty barebones.  Had seating, a/c / heating, a tv, and other stuff needed for front-of-house stuff"
14-02-2020T16:20:03,AspiringNoodle,But they cooked all their meat in a freaking SEMI-TRAILER behind the building
14-02-2020T16:20:10,CrRAR,haha
14-02-2020T16:20:37,AspiringNoodle,"It was a temporary thing, the whole idea is that they would rent the plot, and move the truck there during the warmer months"

14-02-2020T16:20:51,AspiringNoodle,But they eventually moved to a permanent location further away
14-02-2020T16:20:58,CrRAR,nice

14-02-2020T23:04:06,CrRAR,Zootopia originally was supposed to be more Nick-centric about his backstory. Disney decided it “wasn’t as marketable/glamorous enough”

14-02-2020T23:30:18,AspiringNoodle,"As well as the rise of irregular workers, both things aren't officially tracked"
14-02-2020T23:30:19,CrRAR,Everything the Fed is doing is stupid
14-02-2020T23:30:27,CrRAR,Just causing a bigger bubble
14-02-2020T23:30:35,CrRAR,Putting off the inevitable
14-02-2020T23:30:45,AspiringNoodle,Mainly because all these organizations and offices built around tracking the economy are centered around the traditional employee-employer relationship
14-02-2020T23:30:53,CrRAR,Yeah
14-02-2020T23:31:14,AspiringNoodle,"They don't track things like under-employment, under-the-table pay (guilty), and side gigs."
14-02-2020T23:31:34,AspiringNoodle,They also don't track things like effort
14-02-2020T23:31:36,CrRAR,Like last time Moody’s the credit rating org lied about the quality of debt in the morgage system till the levy broke.
14-02-2020T23:31:49,CrRAR,They can’t stop it.
14-02-2020T23:32:01,JojoF2415,My stomach
14-02-2020T23:32:02,CrRAR,"They can lie and deflect it, but they can’t stop it"
14-02-2020T23:32:05,AspiringNoodle,"""look at these numbers, the economy is doing great!"""
14-02-2020T23:32:07,CrRAR,Ow jojo
14-02-2020T23:32:14,JojoF2415,It was worth it though
14-02-2020T23:32:21,AspiringNoodle,"""Yeah, but people are working 2x as hard to make the same pay as 10 years ago"""
14-02-2020T23:32:39,JojoF2415,So much pizza I ate in the theater
14-02-2020T23:33:12,CrRAR,:pizza::pizza::pizza::ctwokinds-floAAA:
14-02-2020T23:33:24,JojoF2415,🍕
14-02-2020T23:34:22,AspiringNoodle,"I think it says something when the place I work pays almost $10, but then I'm only willing to work 3 days a week max"
14-02-2020T23:34:28,AspiringNoodle,And that's because I have debts to pay.
14-02-2020T23:34:59,AspiringNoodle,I'd be happier to work 2 days a week max if it meant I could spend more time working on getting away from it.
14-02-2020T23:36:49,CrRAR,Yeah
14-02-2020T23:37:12,AspiringNoodle,"Not even joking, 3 of our full time employees (manager, AM, keyholder) are all single mothers"
14-02-2020T23:37:49,AspiringNoodle,"And I can only think that that's the sole reason they work full time here.  Because pay is shite, benefits are bad that I've heard them joking about nobody wanting to buy insurance through the company"
14-02-2020T23:38:38,AspiringNoodle,"And because they work mornings, they are in a hurry to get out the door as soon as they can (which tends to lead to unnecessarily shift swaps)"
14-02-2020T23:38:54,AspiringNoodle,unnecessarily chaotic*
14-02-2020T23:39:22,CrRAR,"If you’ve ever seen Apocalypse Now, like most those marines my motto rn is, “Never get off the boat”"
14-02-2020T23:39:25,CrRAR,xD
14-02-2020T23:39:29,CrRAR,aka I’ll do my job and patch things together through your crap decision-making but don’t make me part of the stupidity.
14-02-2020T23:39:43,CrRAR,dun want it
14-02-2020T23:40:37,CrRAR,"Body or mind, NEVER get off the boat."
14-02-2020T23:41:06,CrRAR,Sanity is worth having
14-02-2020T23:41:08,AspiringNoodle,"Like, I'll eat a few 4-day weeks even though I explicitly requested 3 days max, because we lot an employee unexpectedly"
14-02-2020T23:41:20,AspiringNoodle,But don't expect this to go on extended
14-02-2020T23:41:36,AspiringNoodle,Because I've already had my fill of BS and stress with stuff not working properly
14-02-2020T23:42:41,AspiringNoodle,But suffice to say I'll be extra happy if this next week is my last 4-day week
14-02-2020T23:42:49,CrRAR,:fire:[Everything’s]*:fire::ctwokinds-keith8D::fire:*[fine]:fire:
14-02-2020T23:43:01,CrRAR,nice
14-02-2020T23:43:20,AspiringNoodle,Customer service is stressful enough if there's a lot of multitasking
14-02-2020T23:43:38,AspiringNoodle,But through in malfunctioning equipment (constantly) on top of that?  Expect stress to rise and people to quit
14-02-2020T23:43:45,AspiringNoodle,That's exactly how we lost our one employee
14-02-2020T23:44:23,AspiringNoodle,"She probably wasn't suited for this job in the first place, but then add in the BS that goes on, and she couldn't handle it"
14-02-2020T23:44:36,AspiringNoodle,*I* can barely handle it
14-02-2020T23:46:03,AspiringNoodle,I would NEVER want to make this job a full-time gig
14-02-2020T23:46:20,AspiringNoodle,The pay would be low for a long time before I ever go the chanc eto move up to a higher position
14-02-2020T23:46:39,AspiringNoodle,"But add in everything else that goes on?  Why would I want those extra responsibilities, every MORE hours, and stress on top of that?"
14-02-2020T23:52:19,CrRAR,"What’s alarming is despite the crys that “everything’s amazing” from the tops, why then is everything so badly maintained at the bottom!?"
14-02-2020T23:52:34,CrRAR,Something smells fishy
14-02-2020T23:53:02,CrRAR,If you don’t have money to push things forward... how good is everything REALLY!?
14-02-2020T23:53:45,CrRAR,"“Oh, it’s fine”:ctwokinds-keith8D:"
14-02-2020T23:55:12,CrRAR,"What I see happening is the rise in small business is most likely cutting market share up, this is somewhat what happened in year 2000."
14-02-2020T23:56:06,CrRAR,"Businesses ran out of advancements and places to make money from in the economy, businesses budded and grew but ran out of space to run when all the markets were over served."
14-02-2020T23:57:03,CrRAR,"You can’t have 80 companies all trying to make money doing the same damn thing, there’s not enough room in the market."
14-02-2020T23:57:56,CrRAR,They dump what they thing is sure money into advancing/growing their products or services only for it not to collapse when the demand isn’t there.
