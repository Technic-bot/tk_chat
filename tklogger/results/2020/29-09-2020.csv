29-09-2020T00:06:05,CrRAR,Yeah if they over did it making the filling taste like Oreo filling that might be sickening
29-09-2020T00:06:26,CrRAR,The Oreo bits would be welcome

29-09-2020T00:08:10,Dadrobit,People into reptiles usually aren't in my experience. I think dogs have too much personality and love compared to their otherwise cold-blooded and uncaring compatriots.
29-09-2020T00:08:29,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve been bit too many damn times
29-09-2020T00:08:50,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs not a reptile preference

29-09-2020T00:28:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I might be ok with an older kid
29-09-2020T00:28:42,AspiringNoodle,"Hell, I'd probably do the world a service by not having a kid.  Or at least adopting one."
29-09-2020T00:28:54,AspiringNoodle,Might have more impact by teaching people stuff xD
29-09-2020T00:29:06,SpazztasticKiwi,"say I decide I do want kids - if I‚Äôm with someone or not whether that means I‚Äôve yet to find someone or stayed single, I‚Äôll look to adopt"
29-09-2020T00:29:29,SpazztasticKiwi,there‚Äôs more than plenty of older kids parentless
29-09-2020T00:30:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"no diapers, most of the ridiculous tantrums have worked through their systems.."
29-09-2020T00:31:07,SpazztasticKiwi,no potty training...the only unfortunate part is they will not be biologically mine
29-09-2020T00:31:32,CrRAR,Get rich enough you can pay someone ELSE to have your baby

29-09-2020T00:34:45,CrRAR,"Yeah, they sometimes can be reasoned with"
29-09-2020T00:35:03,CrRAR,Early on it's just pure mental insanity
29-09-2020T00:35:29,CrRAR,Like when they get to the age of putting 2+2 together sounds fun
29-09-2020T00:36:11,SpazztasticKiwi,some of them are garbage through and through and that‚Äôs because of the parents but you don‚Äôt come into the world with logic built in or how to stack the building blocks of your reasoning skills or understanding
29-09-2020T00:36:46,CrRAR,But then they start asking if a¬≤+b¬≤=c¬≤ and then it's less fun again
29-09-2020T00:36:49,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs just all in there in a dumped tangle of miscellaneous junk drawer cables
29-09-2020T00:37:20,SpazztasticKiwi,so you get screaming

29-09-2020T00:45:40,SpazztasticKiwi,the raising them is one part but the beginning is the biggest obstacle - you carry and then have it & I have enough with the changes and problems I had with weight in hs and still now
29-09-2020T00:46:10,CrRAR,"Yeah, toughest I think is that even demeanor AS you parent can affect a child. Be to high strung, or short tempered ever, or anxious can upset/change how a child copes with the world"
29-09-2020T00:46:29,CrRAR,*too
29-09-2020T00:46:32,SpazztasticKiwi,there‚Äôs 43 hours of labor stories and tearing and breach births and hemorrhaging
29-09-2020T00:47:31,CrRAR,"Yeah, tbh, I know it's not fun either, but C-sections seem the better way to go. Not that I know a whole lot on the subject."
29-09-2020T00:47:37,SpazztasticKiwi,post pardum depression and the fact that i don‚Äôt like kids - who‚Äôs to say I‚Äôll bond or like one of my own especially if something goes wrong
29-09-2020T00:48:25,CrRAR,"Some view natural as a rite-of-passage kinda, but eh. You're already in the hospital."
29-09-2020T00:48:32,SpazztasticKiwi,after birth healing - the factor of whether the father sticks around or is involved at all
29-09-2020T00:49:02,CrRAR,Yeah that can be unsuspected and very severe to deal w/ it's ALREADY a tough time.
29-09-2020T00:49:15,SpazztasticKiwi,"oh yea c section, nothing like a long ass gash scar across your stomach & you still have to pass the afterbirth"
29-09-2020T00:49:55,CrRAR,"Yeah, none of this sounds preferable."
29-09-2020T00:50:26,SpazztasticKiwi,"and some women can breastfeed, others find they can‚Äôt"
29-09-2020T00:51:45,CrRAR,That would be frustrating.
29-09-2020T00:51:54,SpazztasticKiwi,"there‚Äôs even a condition where the estrogen is so focused to making  breast milk, that‚Äôs where all of it goes....causing vaginal atrophy"

29-09-2020T00:55:22,CrRAR,"Yeah if guys read about all this type of stuff before in depth, they would probably also decline out of respect for their lady."
29-09-2020T00:55:25,SpazztasticKiwi,who‚Äôs to say it‚Äôs bad enough to cause any kind of problem because given family history it‚Äôs sorta more likely Id be alright but
29-09-2020T00:56:04,SpazztasticKiwi,magic conch shell says it‚Äôs not worth it
29-09-2020T00:56:10,SpazztasticKiwi,"and infection...along with before mentioned complications like hemorrhaging, tearing or breach birth (next to the umbilical cord around the neck)"
29-09-2020T00:56:37,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I always said if I were to ever get a kid. I'm adopting."
29-09-2020T00:56:57,CrRAR,"Yeah, it is called a ""miracle"" mostly cuz it seems almost impossible"
29-09-2020T00:57:01,SpazztasticKiwi,kids r us
29-09-2020T00:57:06,Dadrobit,Gonna adopt some 8 year old or something. A kid old enough to recognize what I'm doing for them.
