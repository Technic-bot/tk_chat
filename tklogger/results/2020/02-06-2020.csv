02-06-2020T00:54:17,SpazztasticKiwi,noooooooooo-what on earth is coconut hibiscus https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/524825976597643265/710721074844663889/image1.jpg
02-06-2020T00:58:27,AspiringNoodle,Night everyone~
02-06-2020T00:58:36,AspiringNoodle,Let's see how I like 6 hour shifts
02-06-2020T00:58:43,AspiringNoodle,It's like 7-hour shifts... but an hour shorter :D
02-06-2020T01:00:51,SpazztasticKiwi,that’s how time works
02-06-2020T01:15:54,Dadrobit,Coconut Hibiscus is the name of my new electro-grunge band.
02-06-2020T01:32:11,SpazztasticKiwi,sooooooo you’re generic?
02-06-2020T01:33:12,SpazztasticKiwi,and why does that sound like something from the trolls movie
02-06-2020T02:11:25,SpazztasticKiwi,after this episode 🛌
02-06-2020T02:17:28,JojoGD,I can’t sleep
02-06-2020T02:22:50,CrimsonQuill,Morning all
02-06-2020T02:27:56,JojoGD,Hi quill
02-06-2020T02:28:46,CrimsonQuill,...
02-06-2020T02:28:57,CrimsonQuill,Just got to the second stage of Gundyr in DS3
02-06-2020T02:29:04,CrimsonQuill,I thought his first was bad
02-06-2020T02:29:50,JojoGD,I’m having trouble sleeping. Also I’m 40% done with live dex in Pokémon sword
02-06-2020T02:30:59,JojoGD,Also I’m making another negative kathrin drawing because I didn’t like how the first one came out
02-06-2020T02:31:55,CrimsonQuill,I see
02-06-2020T02:32:04,CrimsonQuill,For the sleeping I recommend camomile tea
02-06-2020T02:32:15,CrimsonQuill,(I may have also got a drawing tablet)
02-06-2020T02:32:42,JojoGD,Nice
02-06-2020T02:34:43,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s only 2ish am
02-06-2020T02:35:24,CrimsonQuill,8:35
02-06-2020T02:35:29,JojoGD,12:35
02-06-2020T02:35:33,CrimsonQuill,Work at 12:30
02-06-2020T02:35:38,CrimsonQuill,Till 8pm
02-06-2020T02:36:02,CrimsonQuill,AspiringNoodle's probably gonna kill me if I haven't beaten Gundyr by then XD
02-06-2020T02:36:25,JojoGD,Downtown San Diego was a mess last weekend
02-06-2020T02:38:41,JojoGD,Not as bad as Minneapolis if I’m correct
02-06-2020T02:38:54,JojoGD,If the place was Minneapolis
02-06-2020T02:38:56,CrimsonQuill,George Floyd riots?
02-06-2020T02:39:01,JojoGD,Yup
02-06-2020T02:39:10,CrimsonQuill,I've seen some news on that.
02-06-2020T02:39:15,CrimsonQuill,It's horrible.
02-06-2020T02:39:24,JojoGD,Tear gas and rubber bullets on downtown
02-06-2020T02:39:28,CrimsonQuill,The government response is disgraceful too.
02-06-2020T02:39:34,JojoGD,Also graffiti
02-06-2020T02:40:00,CrimsonQuill,News reporters charged by police-a BBC Cameraman was charged by a police officer and a CNN correspondent arrested live on television.
02-06-2020T02:40:07,JojoGD,Worst of all is that people that aren’t in the riots are being affected
02-06-2020T02:40:29,CrimsonQuill,These riots and problems are symptomatic of a deeper problem underlying society.
02-06-2020T02:42:19,JojoGD,This could have been avoided if those police officers weren’t stupid
02-06-2020T02:43:27,JojoGD,Anyways :ptv-sleepy:
02-06-2020T02:44:13,CrimsonQuill,"Yeah, sleep well jojo"

02-06-2020T11:48:16,AspiringNoodle,TL;DR: you can't use COVID to excuse every poor decision made by businesses.
02-06-2020T11:50:15,AspiringNoodle,"Also, apologies for my random rant of the day :ptv-hearts:"
02-06-2020T12:04:31,AspiringNoodle,"Mmmmm, :pizza:"

02-06-2020T14:02:56,TerraTheWizard,i'm assuming it's something designed to take away freedoms in some way
02-06-2020T14:03:05,TerraTheWizard,america likes to do that and give them positive names
02-06-2020T14:03:49,TerraTheWizard,"anyway, i need go bed because gotta be up in 5 hours"

02-06-2020T14:32:48,CrimsonQuill,"Work was tricky today, but otherwise okay...and I spent a 1/2 hour against Gundyr in DS3 beforehand XD"
02-06-2020T14:34:56,AspiringNoodle,Yaaaaay~
02-06-2020T14:35:49,CrimsonQuill,My fight style needs work.
02-06-2020T14:35:59,CrimsonQuill,I am way too focused on brute forcing the bosses
02-06-2020T14:36:15,CrimsonQuill,I literally just kept slashing and hoped i could dodge and use my Estus flasks...
02-06-2020T14:36:40,CrimsonQuill,"I didn't even realize he had a second stage. On the bright side, I think I'm out of the tutorial now."
02-06-2020T14:36:46,CrimsonQuill,Lord above in Heaven help me.
02-06-2020T14:39:11,CrimsonQuill,I'm watching a film tonight anyhow to wind down.
02-06-2020T14:39:31,CrimsonQuill,"I had a quiet weekend...so now, i'm not really as worried about games and stuff. :)"
02-06-2020T14:43:26,JojoGD,Hi
02-06-2020T14:43:40,CrimsonQuill,Hiya Jojo!
02-06-2020T14:43:59,JojoGD,Hi quill
02-06-2020T14:45:32,CrimsonQuill,@JojoGD Just checked your gallery-nice work on the Negative and Back-to-Back!
02-06-2020T14:45:39,CrimsonQuill,@JojoGD
02-06-2020T14:45:44,CrimsonQuill,??
02-06-2020T14:45:54,CrimsonQuill,@ funcrion isn't working...
02-06-2020T14:46:42,JojoGD,Oof
02-06-2020T14:47:01,CrimsonQuill,Ah well
02-06-2020T14:47:30,CrimsonQuill,"By the way, since you asked this morning before you left to sleep, the tablet I ordered is a WACOM One"
02-06-2020T14:47:41,CrimsonQuill,I'm still going to work on colour pencils though
02-06-2020T14:50:55,JojoGD,I might get a wacom one in the future
02-06-2020T14:51:27,JojoGD,or I'll just save up more to get a cintiq 16
02-06-2020T14:54:46,JojoGD,Ill just get the one to see if I even like digital art
02-06-2020T14:54:57,JojoGD,wacom one
02-06-2020T15:01:58,CrimsonQuill,"Well, lately i've been a bit frisky with my cash."
02-06-2020T15:02:14,CrimsonQuill,So now I am sticking most of it into my savings account.
02-06-2020T15:02:27,CrimsonQuill,Otherwise I'll end up buying a VR Headset...
02-06-2020T15:03:01,JojoGD,I saving up money but I really don't know what to do with it
02-06-2020T15:03:09,CrimsonQuill,Hmmm
02-06-2020T15:03:15,CrimsonQuill,Potatoes.
02-06-2020T15:03:18,AspiringNoodle,If you guys are serious about digital art
02-06-2020T15:03:29,AspiringNoodle,Huion apparently has some good screen tablets
02-06-2020T15:03:43,JojoGD,I'm more into traditional art
02-06-2020T15:04:08,AspiringNoodle,"A year or two ago they did a pretty big marketing blitz, and a lot of storytime animators / animators in general on youtube got sent their big tablets to try out"
02-06-2020T15:04:09,CrimsonQuill,@AspiringNoodle Kind of? The main reason I'm getting a tablet is because there isn't a scanner I can use if I were to draw my planned comic on A3
02-06-2020T15:04:16,JojoGD,also making negative drawings traditionally is awsome
02-06-2020T15:04:23,AspiringNoodle,And every single one of those artists raved about the product
02-06-2020T15:04:25,CrimsonQuill,But I still want to stick as much to traditional art as possible.
02-06-2020T15:04:32,CrimsonQuill,@JojoGD Oh Heck yes.
02-06-2020T15:04:37,AspiringNoodle,"I mean, it's a screen tablet without selling a kidney to Wacom, and the quality is pretty dang good"
02-06-2020T15:04:39,JojoGD,@CrimsonQuill same
02-06-2020T15:05:13,CrimsonQuill,"@AspringNoodle unfortunately i have already paid for it and it is on its way. Besides, it'll last a while."
02-06-2020T15:05:21,CrimsonQuill,@AspiringNoodle
02-06-2020T15:05:42,JojoGD,There is no point of making negative drawings digitaly. Its easier
02-06-2020T15:05:52,CrimsonQuill,"Anyway, I'm going to head guys-watching a film. :)"
02-06-2020T15:05:57,CrimsonQuill,Cheerio!
02-06-2020T15:06:01,CrimsonQuill,Goodnight
