16-10-2020T01:32:36,SageSaga,yeah- also i messed up - didnt meant to say he was on vocals
16-10-2020T01:32:50,SageSaga,hes a Guitarist
16-10-2020T01:33:24,DarthRexKing,"I don't remember the exact lyrics, but I remember that tone from the power rangers movie. Cheesy, yeah, but that song was awesome."
16-10-2020T01:33:25,SageSaga,I dont know if he did vocals for any of their songs-
16-10-2020T01:34:09,SageSaga,ive got another one coming up you probably know
16-10-2020T01:34:41,Dadrobit,"""How Many Say I"" is Eddie as lead vocalist"
16-10-2020T01:35:23,CrRAR,:ccrrar-katsip::guitar::notes:o7
16-10-2020T01:36:42,Dadrobit,Jump
16-10-2020T01:37:29,SageSaga,one of their most well known songs
16-10-2020T01:38:06,Dadrobit,Get Up I think is the official name no?
16-10-2020T01:38:13,Dadrobit,Iirc
16-10-2020T01:39:47,DarthRexKing,Oooh Nice. o3o
16-10-2020T01:39:47,SageSaga,only seeing it as Jump
16-10-2020T01:40:21,DarthRexKing,Thank you Eddie Van Halen and rest in peace. :V
16-10-2020T01:41:46,Dadrobit,"Yep, ""Get Up"" was a different song, just the lyrics happen to be here incidentally. Jump is the name."
16-10-2020T01:43:31,Dadrobit,Is this the War Of The Lions remastered music? It's definitely not the original.
16-10-2020T01:44:22,SageSaga,this is the old OST
16-10-2020T01:45:17,SageSaga,i had the music CD- it's def the original
16-10-2020T01:45:42,Dadrobit,":/ I was just listening to the ost a week or two ago, feels like there are a lot of little flourishes here that weren't in the original game music?"
16-10-2020T01:46:18,Dadrobit,Unless the standalone cd ost is different from in-game
16-10-2020T01:46:25,Dadrobit,Which is very possible
16-10-2020T01:46:29,SageSaga,it is- they had to cut it down for the game
16-10-2020T01:46:59,Dadrobit,Makes sense then.
16-10-2020T01:49:20,SageSaga,the new book in that tentacleyuri persons series came out
16-10-2020T01:50:32,Dadrobit,"Mmmm, that reminds me, I still need to read the power fantasy book from a bit ago."
16-10-2020T01:51:48,sunblaze,hi everyone
16-10-2020T01:51:59,Dadrobit,o/ blaze
16-10-2020T01:51:59,SageSaga,yo Sunblaze
16-10-2020T01:52:06,SageSaga,did you have a request for this month?
16-10-2020T01:52:24,sunblaze,did I not sent it to you on patreon? let me check
16-10-2020T01:53:05,sunblaze,I did on wednesday :D
16-10-2020T01:53:19,sunblaze,"Kaylin seems to be a bit tired and restless.  So I'd like Nyna ""dressing her up"" sleeping for halloween -> go wild with all the decorations and paint. :D"
16-10-2020T01:53:22,sunblaze,here again
16-10-2020T01:54:15,Dadrobit,So like sharpie-ing a dick on someone's head after they passed out at a college party?
16-10-2020T01:54:51,sunblaze,yes (I actually had a request like that when they passed out drunk) but this time for halloween!
16-10-2020T01:55:14,Dadrobit,Lmfao
16-10-2020T01:57:16,SageSaga,thats weird i just checked patreon-
16-10-2020T01:57:20,Dadrobit,Brb
16-10-2020T01:57:57,SageSaga,i dont really get it though-
16-10-2020T01:58:15,sunblaze,hmmm I will try a new message next time instead of replying to old. maybe thats bugged
16-10-2020T01:58:40,SageSaga,i see it now- but i dont understand the request
16-10-2020T01:59:34,sunblaze,kailyn sleeping and Nyna drawing/decorating her for helloween. technically nyna would not be visible jsut her actions
16-10-2020T02:00:44,SageSaga,that seems kinda out of character for Nyna- painting on her pets face- would be kinda weird- maybe playing with her hair or something-
16-10-2020T02:02:53,SageSaga,"just saying- she wouldnt ""deface"" her own property- thats more of a punishment to herself"
16-10-2020T02:02:55,sunblaze,oh sure jsut giving ideas hairdressing a few plants or similar is totally fine decoration
16-10-2020T02:06:01,Dadrobit,Back I think.
16-10-2020T02:06:49,Dadrobit,Upper management woke up to the news of the sick guard. People in suits are not happy and are having a bit of a fit over the situation.
16-10-2020T02:07:53,ZRO4825,No doubt.
16-10-2020T02:08:08,SageSaga,thats good- or bad- depending on the kind of fit
16-10-2020T02:08:14,Dadrobit,Already have so many sick employees that no one is allowed any time off until at least next year.
16-10-2020T02:08:47,SageSaga,yes- because that is how illness works
16-10-2020T02:09:18,Dadrobit,Management is.... Well they're not great.
16-10-2020T02:10:01,sunblaze,is she nibbeling her ear? thats great!

16-10-2020T02:24:18,Dadrobit,"Because the ""fun time teamwork building exercises"" we're inevitably going to have to do can't be done with an email..."
16-10-2020T02:24:40,AspiringNoodle,"Aka, they either think COVID is a joke or don't give a flying f*** about employee health / safety."
16-10-2020T02:24:54,Dadrobit,#2
16-10-2020T02:25:04,FenceEqualizer,Honestly...yeah I can see that.
16-10-2020T02:25:13,AspiringNoodle,"I was thinking, ""A little Column A, little Column B"", lol"
16-10-2020T02:25:50,Dadrobit,"And I have to be there to do a speech on how the night crew is doing, so I absolutely can't play hooky..."
16-10-2020T02:26:22,AspiringNoodle,"COVID is shaping up to be one of those things where until either your behind is in the ICU on death's door, or someone close to you is, or someone close to you dies, people won't take this seriously."

16-10-2020T02:29:32,AspiringNoodle,Like that one funeral that infected nearly 30 people :D
16-10-2020T02:29:49,Dadrobit,"""Some people"" is code for ""I'm just making this shit up on the spot"""
16-10-2020T02:30:11,Dadrobit,"""Some people are saying..."" Means literally no one has actually said it."

16-10-2020T02:31:01,SageSaga,i want a list of all the dumbest things he has said- not including his obvious errors- so its just- pure stupidity
16-10-2020T02:31:19,SageSaga,"like ""Who's boat is this? Is this your boat? Well, perhaps it's your boat now"""
16-10-2020T02:31:46,Dadrobit,Like when the American Revolutionaries captured an airport during the Revolutionary War?
16-10-2020T02:32:11,Dadrobit,That one. That fucking blew mind.
16-10-2020T02:32:15,Dadrobit,My mind*
16-10-2020T02:32:31,SageSaga,hmm- i think that counts as a flub because he mixed up a later talking point-
16-10-2020T02:33:08,Dadrobit,"Yeah, but how do you not catch it and then at least try to correct what you said."
16-10-2020T02:33:19,Dadrobit,Dude just rolled with it.
16-10-2020T02:33:19,SageSaga,"how about ""You don't need to know my opinion, you can have your own opinion, take it however you want"""
16-10-2020T02:33:43,Dadrobit,"Up there with, ""I don't take any responsibility"""

16-10-2020T02:35:05,Dadrobit,"No, that'd just create an immediate balkinization of the US, a very bad possibility."
16-10-2020T02:35:33,Dadrobit,Immediately imploding the government I mean.
16-10-2020T02:35:51,SageSaga,governments that implode usually end up in a horrible spiral for many years before things straighten out and can be worse for it
16-10-2020T02:36:15,AspiringNoodle,"Well, it's gonna happen eventually, the political situation keeps deteriorating, Congress has already devolved into ""take majority of both houses, ram through legislation with no compromises."""
16-10-2020T02:36:21,Dadrobit,"Each state would just say fuck it, we'll set off on our own and we'd all be fucked for it."
16-10-2020T02:36:47,FenceEqualizer,Hell Cali is already getting antsy with that.
16-10-2020T02:37:08,Dadrobit,Isolationism is the worst outcome.
16-10-2020T02:38:44,AspiringNoodle,"Pretty good chance that come this election, whichever party loses will implode, leaving one party to maintain power for the better part of the next decade at least"
16-10-2020T02:39:37,DarthRexKing,"I have always said, things will become worse before they become better. . .but I personally believe that unless humanity can learn to tame their primal natures and become aware of our bad habits, we will always repeat."

16-10-2020T02:39:42,DarthRexKing,That is just my personal view.

16-10-2020T02:41:30,Dadrobit,Republicans won't die from losing one election. The thing about Republicans is that they have only one requirement: Have an R on the ballot. That's why Trump still had fervent support from at least 1/3 of the country.

16-10-2020T02:44:06,FenceEqualizer,Trump is such a cartoon character. I keep expecting him to go Sike one day and just turn a 180 personality wise. Like some elebarote experimental con.

16-10-2020T02:45:29,Dadrobit,It was a discussion point for a while. It was one of Yang's talking points for sure.

16-10-2020T15:24:50,SpazztasticKiwi,depending how long they‚Äôre cooked but they do have to cook a bit cause raw peanuts can be poisonous
