08-10-2020T02:34:14,AspiringNoodle,"I get it, he's the new guy, but he's so paranoid about abuse / power harassment at the company that he is completely unable to take any form of criticism or remark."
08-10-2020T02:35:10,AspiringNoodle,"And in fact, I'd argue he's the problem because his passive-aggressive behavior is not only legitimate harassment, but he's creating a hostile work environment.  Just... oof."
08-10-2020T02:38:02,AspiringNoodle,"Dadro, what do you think of Anai?  Or has it been too long? xD"
08-10-2020T02:54:02,AspiringNoodle,Huh... that was pretty fast character development.  Let's see where Anai goes from that festival

08-10-2020T15:13:03,K3IDRAN,I found some comics Tom did before. Twokinds on Reddit
08-10-2020T15:13:31,CrimsonQuill,Oh?
08-10-2020T15:14:17,K3IDRAN,I think  like around 2002 or 1999 idk

08-10-2020T15:16:26,CrimsonQuill,"We know he was doing the 'Halfkind' comic, which was a precursor..."
08-10-2020T15:19:53,K3IDRAN,Before i knew Twokinds & Bloodline i was  having fun with bots on Black ops 2
08-10-2020T15:22:27,K3IDRAN,I didn't really play Multiplayer cus of tose fookin' Campers
08-10-2020T15:22:37,K3IDRAN,And. Target finder
08-10-2020T15:23:03,CrimsonQuill,Target finder?
08-10-2020T15:24:37,K3IDRAN,It's an attachment on Black ops 2 which while aiming it  shows the Target by Highlightsing the target via Diamond
08-10-2020T15:25:11,K3IDRAN,Highlighting
08-10-2020T15:25:31,CrimsonQuill,OOOhhhdeeeear

08-10-2020T15:27:36,AspiringNoodle,"He had a claymore set up on one side, so I went around the other way"
08-10-2020T15:27:52,AspiringNoodle,I snuck up behind him and waited for my team to only need 1 more kill
08-10-2020T15:28:12,K3IDRAN,Did you knife him?
08-10-2020T15:28:32,AspiringNoodle,"Pulled out my noob tube, lined up a shot, and every got to see a final kill cam of me taking my sweet time aiming, then launching a grenade right up his ass xD"
08-10-2020T15:28:45,JojoGD,lol
08-10-2020T15:28:47,K3IDRAN,XD
08-10-2020T15:28:51,AspiringNoodle,Best part?
08-10-2020T15:29:09,AspiringNoodle,"Because it was a projectile, the cam went into slow-mo and followed the grenade"
08-10-2020T15:29:19,JojoGD,i really played shooting based games before
08-10-2020T15:29:54,K3IDRAN,I could imagine everyone were laughing their assds off
08-10-2020T15:30:00,K3IDRAN,Asses
08-10-2020T15:30:02,AspiringNoodle,I know I was!
08-10-2020T15:30:11,JojoGD,yup
08-10-2020T15:31:53,AspiringNoodle,"I played a lot of shooters when I was younger.  I was really big into Battlefield.  Eventually I learned that with sniper rifles, if you were close enough to a target, you could one-shot them in the chest"
08-10-2020T15:32:02,K3IDRAN,Lol
08-10-2020T15:32:16,K3IDRAN,Destruction is what i love kn bf
08-10-2020T15:32:20,K3IDRAN,In
08-10-2020T15:32:35,AspiringNoodle,"So in Battlefield 3, one of my favorite things was to slap a red dot sight on my most powerful rifle, and just run into the fray"
08-10-2020T15:32:57,K3IDRAN,So you become god
08-10-2020T15:33:18,AspiringNoodle,Yup.  I was definitely a sniper in those games
08-10-2020T15:33:32,JojoGD,"All i played was pokemon, terraria, Minecraft, and geometry dash my entire childhood"
08-10-2020T15:33:35,AspiringNoodle,Liked playing on normal difficulty because sniping at range required a headshot for a kill
08-10-2020T15:33:47,K3IDRAN,Rip brain
08-10-2020T15:33:51,AspiringNoodle,Nothing like pulling off a headshot on a target 460m away when they're in a full sprint
08-10-2020T15:34:18,K3IDRAN,Target:  Kill kill ii- *dies*
08-10-2020T15:34:55,AspiringNoodle,"Aside from that, my hobby in Battlefield was c4 shenanigans"
08-10-2020T15:35:15,K3IDRAN,Suicide bombing?
08-10-2020T15:35:19,AspiringNoodle,Sometimes
08-10-2020T15:35:27,AspiringNoodle,One time I killed a friend who was on the enemy team by accident xD
08-10-2020T15:35:41,AspiringNoodle,I was screwing around and setting up C4 at the base of a building in a way I knew would cause it to collapse
08-10-2020T15:35:54,AspiringNoodle,"I ran out of the building and pulled the trigger, got a kill confirmation"
08-10-2020T15:36:07,K3IDRAN,If  i had a mic i would yell out ALLAH AKBAR and ms and the enemy
08-10-2020T15:36:14,K3IDRAN,Kms
08-10-2020T15:36:16,AspiringNoodle,"Got a message shortly after, apparently a friend was trying to be cheeky and knife me from behind without me knowing"
08-10-2020T15:36:49,JojoGD,lmao
08-10-2020T15:37:34,AspiringNoodle,"But I was honestly extra dickish when it came to the APC vehicle.  I can't remember the name of it.  All I know is that it was heavily armored, could hold 6 players, and had machine guns.  Was basically a mobile spawn point / way for them to push in"
08-10-2020T15:38:15,K3IDRAN,Why am i imagining a Tk video game having Killcams Skyrim style
08-10-2020T15:38:17,AspiringNoodle,"This thing normally spawned towards the middle / back of their base, so I would be in their back lines, planting C4 on this thing when it spawned, and would wait for it to start moving."
08-10-2020T15:38:33,AspiringNoodle,"Let it move forward towards the battle a bit, THEN blow it up"
08-10-2020T15:38:38,K3IDRAN,Car bombs
08-10-2020T15:38:47,K3IDRAN,Wait
08-10-2020T15:38:57,K3IDRAN,Sabatoge
08-10-2020T15:39:18,AspiringNoodle,Man... I miss homefront pvp
08-10-2020T15:39:29,AspiringNoodle,"Wasn't that popular, but I loved it."
08-10-2020T15:39:54,K3IDRAN,Kim jong un has gone too far
08-10-2020T15:40:18,AspiringNoodle,"Had a neat mechanic where if you were a menace, you'd get a bounty on you and some players on the other team would get a rough location for you, and a bonus if they off'd you"
08-10-2020T15:40:42,AspiringNoodle,I LOVED that mechanic.  Was extra fun since my hobby was getting the dragon skins for weapons
08-10-2020T15:42:39,K3IDRAN,But god damn the North koeans has good buildings
08-10-2020T15:43:35,AspiringNoodle,Homefront is also an example of why pre-order bonuses are a plague on the games industry
08-10-2020T15:43:53,AspiringNoodle,"Only shotgun in the entire game is locked behind a pre-order bonus, probably Gamestop."
08-10-2020T15:44:18,AspiringNoodle,"Not like it matters.  At some point years ago, the company was bought out and the multiplayer servers were shut down."
08-10-2020T15:44:20,K3IDRAN,A shott
08-10-2020T15:44:55,AspiringNoodle,"Well, ima watch some Aggretsuko for now"

08-10-2020T16:04:50,CrRAR,Lil spice goes with lots of stuff better
08-10-2020T16:04:59,AspiringNoodle,"Example, there's a bar that does a great meatloaf around here"
08-10-2020T16:05:02,CrRAR,Can you get waffle cajun fries?
08-10-2020T16:05:10,CrRAR,That sounds good
08-10-2020T16:05:18,CrRAR,Good recipe?
08-10-2020T16:05:19,AspiringNoodle,"My dish will usually be meatloaf, mashed potatoes, and asparagus"
08-10-2020T16:05:22,AspiringNoodle,Oh yeh
08-10-2020T16:05:51,AspiringNoodle,"Usually I eat the meatloaf last, but it's a tossup whether I eat the potatoes or asparagus first.  But usually it's asparagus."
08-10-2020T16:06:12,AspiringNoodle,I enjoy all the things
08-10-2020T16:06:16,CrRAR,"Yup, put down the greens~"
08-10-2020T16:06:30,CrRAR,Legitimate strategy

08-10-2020T22:18:27,Twokinds,"Old Trace considered Detritus too danger to use. But he forgot it was still triggered to wake if Rose ever gained full power, since he never intended to ever lift Rose's restrictions."
08-10-2020T22:18:48,RimaDraws,shit
08-10-2020T22:18:52,Tufi,Esta muy cuco ❤❤❤
08-10-2020T22:19:19,Dragusthor,"Clovis and now a shadow demon, what a madness that continues now?"
08-10-2020T22:19:20,steelabjur,Then New Trace wanders in and upsets the apple cart being a good boy. Ironic.
08-10-2020T22:19:25,CrimsonHelsing,"If dark Trace has any advice on how to kill this thing, now would be a very good time to say something. And just this once Trace should listen to him. Just this once!"
08-10-2020T22:20:34,NezumiYuki,Only now notices how Maren is stuck in a crystal*    Hey she's like Krystal!  Neat!
08-10-2020T22:20:37,Ordithus,"I was going to say Detritus is tall, but he's similar to Maren, here.  Trace looks short."
08-10-2020T22:20:41,steelabjur,"I think if Old Trace knew how to destroy Detritus, he would have."
08-10-2020T22:21:20,unsteddyphoenix,"Hm, yeah true. Maybe Maren will be made a bit shorter in the ink"
08-10-2020T22:21:24,InTheLionsDen,It was on his things to do list. Just didn't get around to it.
08-10-2020T22:22:02,MuonNeutrino,or he still wanted it around because it was an experiment he wasn't sure he was completely done with?
08-10-2020T22:22:13,MuonNeutrino,v0v
08-10-2020T22:22:14,steelabjur,"Detritus is up on a ledge, so he's higher up than Trace, while Maren is floating."
08-10-2020T22:22:32,Twokinds,She is floating
08-10-2020T22:22:53,InTheLionsDen,Marinating Maren.
08-10-2020T22:23:00,unsteddyphoenix,Oh ew lo

08-10-2020T22:23:35,Ordithus,this is more interesting
08-10-2020T22:23:40,Twokinds,I changed it to the crystal to be more dramatic. lol
08-10-2020T22:23:51,NezumiYuki,"A good choice, Tom"
