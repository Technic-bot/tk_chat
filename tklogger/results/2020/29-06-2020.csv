29-06-2020T00:22:09,ThoseButterflys,"oooooooooooooooooooh okay so sat ""rose thats there now is bad?"
29-06-2020T00:22:51,AspiringNoodle,"Or something screwy is going on.  The current year in the comic is 482.  So if that portrait is right, she been ded 2 years"
29-06-2020T00:23:27,ThoseButterflys,oof sompin spooky hapnin
29-06-2020T00:23:59,AspiringNoodle,She's either a spirit who's been bound to the manor
29-06-2020T00:24:19,AspiringNoodle,A recreation / imitation of the original with memories
29-06-2020T00:24:38,ThoseButterflys,or she is part of the mannor
29-06-2020T00:24:58,AspiringNoodle,That is also a possibility
29-06-2020T00:25:17,AspiringNoodle,We don't know what kind of magic tomfoolery is going on with that place
29-06-2020T00:25:33,ThoseButterflys,true
29-06-2020T00:25:39,AspiringNoodle,"The last possibility is that evil Trace actually managed to extend her lifespan, but didn't want the secret getting out"
29-06-2020T00:25:47,AspiringNoodle,But that one is the longshot
29-06-2020T00:26:46,ThoseButterflys,still a possibility
29-06-2020T01:21:32,AspiringNoodle,I'm amazed with myself xD

29-06-2020T15:24:44,SpazztasticKiwi,did anyone else get the amber alert yesterday for Elisha Jenkins?
29-06-2020T15:26:20,CrRAR,Not here.
29-06-2020T15:26:28,CrRAR,Has she been found?
29-06-2020T15:26:48,SpazztasticKiwi,he
29-06-2020T15:27:10,SpazztasticKiwi,not reported
29-06-2020T15:27:13,SpazztasticKiwi,"1 year old black boy, blue Hyundai Sonata (2015), tag 4822BB1"
29-06-2020T15:28:01,SpazztasticKiwi,last seen West 5th st. Bay Minette Al
29-06-2020T15:30:41,SpazztasticKiwi,"he was stolen by a Jamie Hobbs, white with brown eyes & hair"
29-06-2020T15:32:33,SpazztasticKiwi,I can‚Äôt see them coming across anyone here & being spotted but it can‚Äôt hurt

29-06-2020T15:40:14,CrRAR,Poor lil bab
29-06-2020T15:40:35,SpazztasticKiwi,smush face
29-06-2020T15:41:32,CrRAR,"Sometimes it's a custody thing, so he may not be super in danger, just parental/guardian squabbles."
29-06-2020T15:42:00,SpazztasticKiwi,it says he‚Äôs believed to be in extreme danger
29-06-2020T15:42:30,CrRAR,Dang
29-06-2020T15:42:49,SpazztasticKiwi,the theory is he was on visit with mom & the alert only happened because it took so long between her being ‚Äúlate‚Äù and ‚Äúnot returning‚Äù
29-06-2020T15:44:03,CrRAR,ah
29-06-2020T15:44:21,SpazztasticKiwi,but who knows if they‚Äôre actually related
29-06-2020T15:44:24,SpazztasticKiwi,it doesn‚Äôt say
29-06-2020T15:45:06,CrRAR,They got all that info they should be hot on the trail.
29-06-2020T15:45:41,SpazztasticKiwi,unless she was bright enough to swap cars
29-06-2020T15:45:53,SpazztasticKiwi,but they still don‚Äôt know where she‚Äôs heading
29-06-2020T15:54:41,CrRAR,"Yeah, the police coordinate all sorts of tactics, they'll contact all relatives and next of kin and setup highway checkpoints and stuff."

29-06-2020T17:11:39,Dadrobit,"Nah, no amber alerts where I'm at at the moment. A few Silver alerts tho"
29-06-2020T18:32:23,CrRAR,Ok I'll bite...
29-06-2020T18:32:28,CrRAR,Are silver alerts for when someone busts out of the old age home?
29-06-2020T18:43:00,Dadrobit,"It's for anyone who's old, not just the old folks' homes."
29-06-2020T18:45:02,Dadrobit,Lotsa old folks with dementia and alzheimer's end up leaving their home thinking they need to be somewhere and they wind up driving into the middle of the desert until their car dies while it's 110F out. Very quick and unfortunate way to die.
29-06-2020T18:48:26,SpazztasticKiwi,& hyenas have a cursed laugh yell noise
29-06-2020T18:49:01,SpazztasticKiwi,does Kat have a ugly laugh
