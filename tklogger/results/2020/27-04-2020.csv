27-04-2020T16:25:37,CrimsonQuill,NOOO
27-04-2020T16:31:33,JojoGD,F
27-04-2020T16:37:37,CrimsonQuill,Still wondering whether I should change my suggestion
27-04-2020T16:37:49,CrimsonQuill,"It's currently a lore thing, which I like..."
27-04-2020T16:38:08,CrimsonQuill,But I kinda wanna do another RaineXRed pic...but maybe I do too many of those...
27-04-2020T16:41:40,CrimsonQuill,"Suggestions, suggestions...."
27-04-2020T16:59:08,CrimsonQuill,What suggestions're you all thinking of?
27-04-2020T17:00:35,KeefMcDerpface,Here's one: Tom bumps into the TK cast while at a convention.
27-04-2020T17:00:50,CrimsonQuill,Oooh
27-04-2020T17:00:54,CrimsonQuill,That'd be cool
27-04-2020T17:02:14,CrimsonQuill,One reason I want to give Raine and Red a Break is that there's a user on Patreon and Deviantart who...really has it out for Red.
27-04-2020T17:04:13,CrimsonQuill,Aheh
27-04-2020T17:04:20,CrimsonQuill,That's putting it lightly
27-04-2020T17:04:24,CrimsonQuill,...
27-04-2020T17:04:44,CrimsonQuill,Tk convention encounter...who'd he meet?
27-04-2020T17:04:48,CrimsonQuill,Team A?
27-04-2020T17:04:52,CrimsonQuill,Or Team B?
27-04-2020T17:04:54,CrimsonQuill,Or both?
27-04-2020T17:04:56,KeefMcDerpface,Both?
27-04-2020T17:05:00,CrimsonQuill,Noice
27-04-2020T17:05:30,KeefMcDerpface,And there are two endings to this.
27-04-2020T17:05:39,CrimsonQuill,The meeting?
27-04-2020T17:06:05,KeefMcDerpface,Tom asks how they did their costumes and things don't end well.
27-04-2020T17:06:08,KeefMcDerpface,Or
27-04-2020T17:07:11,KeefMcDerpface,"Some of the cast members ""kidnap"" Tom and make demands for some things."
27-04-2020T17:07:19,CrimsonQuill,Ohoho
27-04-2020T17:07:29,CrimsonQuill,Both seem...unfortunate for Tom
27-04-2020T17:07:42,CrimsonQuill,I like it
27-04-2020T17:07:43,KeefMcDerpface,Example: Flora wanting a big chest / Natani wanting to be a male ect. ect.
27-04-2020T17:07:48,CrimsonQuill,Aheheheh
27-04-2020T17:08:38,CrimsonQuill,That figures
27-04-2020T17:10:19,CrimsonQuill,Mine's either going to stay as a lore sketch (Razing of Wreathwood)
27-04-2020T17:10:30,CrimsonQuill,Or maybe Raine and Red going out for a meal.
27-04-2020T17:10:34,CrimsonQuill,Something nice.
27-04-2020T17:10:45,CrimsonQuill,A meal or a dance.
27-04-2020T17:11:11,KeefMcDerpface,"""Why not both?"" - Something one of the two may ask."
27-04-2020T17:11:19,CrimsonQuill,Ahehe
27-04-2020T17:11:20,CrimsonQuill,True
27-04-2020T17:11:27,CrimsonQuill,But it'd be easier for Tom
27-04-2020T17:11:56,KeefMcDerpface,And then troll Tom kicks in and has them eating while dancing.
27-04-2020T17:12:05,CrimsonQuill,"The thing is though, when I was reading through the comments of 'Halfkind Kiss' and 'Christmas Tail Fail' there was someone who...VEHEMENTLY...hated Red."
27-04-2020T17:12:29,CrimsonQuill,"As in...well, I will quote them from the Deviantart comments of 'Halfkind Kiss'..."
27-04-2020T17:12:41,CrimsonQuill,"""I anti-ship Red. I want him to die alone."""
27-04-2020T17:12:49,CrimsonQuill,Which...makes me feel a bit nervous
27-04-2020T17:12:54,CrimsonQuill,About such a suggestion...
27-04-2020T17:13:26,KeefMcDerpface,Does that person say anything for any other sketch with Red?
27-04-2020T17:13:32,CrimsonQuill,Pretty much
27-04-2020T17:13:38,CrimsonQuill,Someone named MoppyPuppy
27-04-2020T17:13:58,CrimsonQuill,I understand why some people might dislike Red.
27-04-2020T17:14:12,CrimsonQuill,"Heck, I didn't start warming up to him till Chapter 17"
27-04-2020T17:15:07,CrimsonQuill,"But someone vehemently insisting that a character is incorrigble like that...I know I am a little hostile to Clovis, but I understand why some people like Clovis pics for example"
27-04-2020T17:15:31,CrimsonQuill,"So why not Red pics too? In my opinion, he doesn't get enough credit."
27-04-2020T17:15:53,CrimsonQuill,"Gotta give that guy points for at least TRYING to change his outlook.,"
27-04-2020T17:16:01,CrimsonQuill,...
27-04-2020T17:16:08,KeefMcDerpface,"""He's trying ffs, give him 10 to 50 years."""
27-04-2020T17:16:17,CrimsonQuill,Aheheh
27-04-2020T17:16:23,CrimsonQuill,That's kinda why I like him
27-04-2020T17:16:29,CrimsonQuill,I see a lot of myself in him.
27-04-2020T17:16:36,CrimsonQuill,Kinda an asshole...but able to change.
27-04-2020T17:16:55,KeefMcDerpface,"""And if he doesn't turn around by then. Then you can kill him."""
27-04-2020T17:16:56,CrimsonQuill,Isn't that one of the core themes of the comic? Bad people changing for the better?
27-04-2020T17:17:07,KeefMcDerpface,Yes.
27-04-2020T17:17:14,CrimsonQuill,@KeefMcDerpface where was that comment from?
27-04-2020T17:17:23,KeefMcDerpface,Which one?
27-04-2020T17:17:34,CrimsonQuill,Both I suppose
27-04-2020T17:17:40,KeefMcDerpface,I don't know.
27-04-2020T17:18:03,KeefMcDerpface,I make references to things without knowing.

27-04-2020T17:20:48,KeefMcDerpface,The first and maybe not only time I'll make a reference to something without knowing.

27-04-2020T20:20:38,SpazztasticKiwi,has everyone seen Mark with his cousin clip on ig a few hours ago
27-04-2020T20:36:05,IronHorseComics,whaaaaaa?
27-04-2020T20:36:07,IronHorseComics,no I have not
27-04-2020T20:36:19,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs from Korea uh
27-04-2020T20:36:34,SpazztasticKiwi,how many months ago did he go again
27-04-2020T20:37:01,IronHorseComics,"oh it was on instagram, no wonder I hadn't seen it. Uhhh it was almost a year ago was it not?"
27-04-2020T20:37:14,IronHorseComics,"oh, speaking of Mark's family, hey Tom"
27-04-2020T20:37:34,SpazztasticKiwi,yeah but this clip is from their mother‚Äôs account
27-04-2020T20:37:40,SpazztasticKiwi,she posted it today
27-04-2020T20:37:43,SpazztasticKiwi,"also, snek doin a sneak in the leaves near the front steps"
27-04-2020T20:38:35,SpazztasticKiwi,and I asked the shark conservation people and they say Fletcher is in his 20s-30s
27-04-2020T20:39:04,IronHorseComics,is Fletcher into shark conservation? Cool
27-04-2020T20:39:07,SpazztasticKiwi,"but short of seeing a sharks birth day, there‚Äôs no way of telling their true age"
27-04-2020T20:39:17,SpazztasticKiwi,fletcher is the shark I adopted
27-04-2020T20:39:24,IronHorseComics,"oh, lol"
27-04-2020T20:41:22,SpazztasticKiwi,he swam over 270 miles in the last 24 hour period
27-04-2020T20:41:45,Ordithus,Z:ctwokinds-karenOOO:M
27-04-2020T20:42:01,SpazztasticKiwi,he‚Äôs on the move but the question is why
27-04-2020T20:42:17,SpazztasticKiwi,"last 24 hour period, it was only 61 miles"
27-04-2020T20:43:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I would guess food cause sharks gotta shark
27-04-2020T20:44:15,Ordithus,"he averaged 11 miles every hour, for 24 hours"
27-04-2020T20:44:24,Ordithus,ocean currents?
27-04-2020T20:47:09,SpazztasticKiwi,he‚Äôs traveling the area beside Australia & north of New Zealand
27-04-2020T20:47:47,SpazztasticKiwi,but it seems he backtracked the miles he swam forward yesterday - this area must be his territory
27-04-2020T20:50:06,SpazztasticKiwi,"like I said yesterday, there is a girl shark nearby"
27-04-2020T20:51:10,Ordithus,chasing tail :ctwokinds-sytheeyebrows:
27-04-2020T20:52:25,SpazztasticKiwi,there‚Äôs no telling they crossed paths or not
27-04-2020T20:52:43,SpazztasticKiwi,she was close the 26th but that‚Äôs her last ping
27-04-2020T20:53:18,SpazztasticKiwi,& her name is Headstone
27-04-2020T20:55:20,SpazztasticKiwi,"she‚Äôs around the same age, but a foot+ shorter"
27-04-2020T21:03:46,AspiringNoodle,Random question
27-04-2020T21:04:22,AspiringNoodle,"My hair feels off.  I know it's mainly because it's a lot longer, but could it also be because it hasn't been worked on? xD"
27-04-2020T21:04:47,AspiringNoodle,I wants a haircut so bad ._.
27-04-2020T21:08:19,IronHorseComics,"you seem to be drawing Windstraw more Tom, are you trying to tell us something?"
27-04-2020T21:10:05,Ordithus,oh heck that's adorable
27-04-2020T21:12:43,Twokinds,Just felt like drawing her more
27-04-2020T21:13:38,SpazztasticKiwi,‚Äúquarantine is drawing me crazy‚Äù
27-04-2020T21:13:41,SpazztasticKiwi,ü•Å
27-04-2020T21:14:07,Twokinds,Small cat proportions are challenging.
27-04-2020T21:14:31,IronHorseComics,"well, you seem to be doing okay so far"
27-04-2020T21:15:01,SpazztasticKiwi,she looks related to a sand cat
27-04-2020T21:15:11,SpazztasticKiwi,no striping tho
27-04-2020T21:22:36,IronHorseComics,"I'm glad and kind of scared about finishing up this chapter in Fluffy 500, because the next one is long as balls and is at a carnival... lots, and lots.. of crowds.... *whine*"
27-04-2020T21:23:59,AspiringNoodle,"Omg, Windstraw is so cuuuuuuuuuuute"
27-04-2020T21:24:02,AspiringNoodle,Also drunk
27-04-2020T21:32:11,SpazztasticKiwi,he‚Äôs trying his best https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/524825976597643265/704882598471663737/image0.png
27-04-2020T21:35:40,Ordithus,snake: 0 dead mouse: 1
27-04-2020T21:52:00,AspiringNoodle,awww
27-04-2020T22:01:14,AspiringNoodle,"Doesn't matter if you use it or not.  Lost 100k souls thanks to that death?  Oh well, f*ck you, still counts towards your total."
27-04-2020T22:01:19,AspiringNoodle,RIP
27-04-2020T22:01:42,AspiringNoodle,Much like my character in Dark Souls about 10 minutes ago c:
27-04-2020T22:01:52,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-snicker:
27-04-2020T22:07:53,Dadrobit,"Congratulations, you convinced me to play Bloodborne again."
27-04-2020T22:12:01,AspiringNoodle,"Lo, I take it that game works a lot better in terms of PvP?"
27-04-2020T22:12:52,AspiringNoodle,"I'm enjoying DS2.  While there were definitely the fair share of kindergarden grade boss fights, the DLC areas are proving much harder.  Now only if I would stop running into the same ""mob = difficulty"" design everywhere..."
27-04-2020T22:13:06,Dadrobit,"Nah, almost non-existent pvp. I just prefer it over the DS games."
27-04-2020T22:14:50,AspiringNoodle,Dark Souls 2 has some well documented questionable design decisions
27-04-2020T22:15:13,AspiringNoodle,"Like tying the time it takes to use items, or the iFrames on rolls / backsteps to a stat"
27-04-2020T22:15:40,AspiringNoodle,"The Soul Memory mechanic, which creates a horde more problems than it solves, and the lackluster early boss fights"
27-04-2020T22:16:46,AspiringNoodle,"Right now though, Soul Memory is what's killing me.  Every time I die and lose 40 - 60k souls, that's 40 - 60k souls added to my SM count that I didn't even get to use.  And a lot of tiers are defined by a 100k range."
27-04-2020T22:17:07,AspiringNoodle,"Do that enough times, and I'm bumped up to way higher tiers than I could've been for my progress."
27-04-2020T22:19:10,SpazztasticKiwi,üçø
27-04-2020T22:21:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"if I bet, there‚Äôll be a possum in the trap tomorrow & not a cat"
27-04-2020T22:21:49,AspiringNoodle,My money's on snek
27-04-2020T22:22:55,SpazztasticKiwi,what snake is going after canned tuna
27-04-2020T22:24:26,AspiringNoodle,Super hungry snek?
27-04-2020T22:24:37,AspiringNoodle,Also wow... wish I could share this view with you guys
27-04-2020T22:24:42,AspiringNoodle,Eleum Loyce is beautiful.
27-04-2020T22:31:22,SpazztasticKiwi,fish are poor for snakes
27-04-2020T22:31:34,SpazztasticKiwi,low values
27-04-2020T22:40:27,SpazztasticKiwi,aaaaaand cat tore down the curtain
27-04-2020T22:48:01,SpazztasticKiwi,that tweet JUST came through
27-04-2020T22:48:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Alabama really is set in the past
27-04-2020T23:12:54,AspiringNoodle,First DLC area DONE
27-04-2020T23:33:28,SpazztasticKiwi,poor Mark and Ethan terrified about possible sea creatures without knowing of the Titanoboa and it‚Äôs relative Gigantophis
27-04-2020T23:35:25,SpazztasticKiwi,or who knows maybe they know and forgot about them
