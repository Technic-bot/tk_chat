08-04-2020T18:29:48,SpazztasticKiwi,or get them to mix colors and show how they combine and change

08-04-2020T18:32:14,AspiringNoodle,That color lesson with the icing would be perfect because it's straight out of color theory <3
08-04-2020T18:32:40,SpazztasticKiwi,they say daughters are karma for what you did as a boy
