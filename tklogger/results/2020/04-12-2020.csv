04-12-2020T00:18:35,Nekonny,this process is so long... it's hard to be enthusiastic about doing it multiple times :(
04-12-2020T00:18:54,EpicFail,Whatcha doin to it?
04-12-2020T00:18:59,EpicFail,uvs?
04-12-2020T00:19:13,Nekonny,"well, I finished all the modeling"
04-12-2020T00:19:26,Nekonny,now Ive colapsed the while thing into a single mesh
04-12-2020T00:19:35,Nekonny,so now it's either UVs or rigging
04-12-2020T00:19:51,Nekonny,not sure which to dtackle first
04-12-2020T00:21:19,Nekonny,ive been working on this all day... and although I'm a bit burned out
04-12-2020T00:21:23,EpicFail,ive never tried skinning in blender o-o
04-12-2020T00:21:25,Nekonny,I want to finish it
04-12-2020T00:21:31,EpicFail,er rigging either
04-12-2020T00:21:56,Nekonny,ive done both
04-12-2020T00:21:58,Nekonny,but..
04-12-2020T00:22:15,Nekonny,"I wanted to update the model, so I have to go back and redo everything"
04-12-2020T00:22:27,Nekonny,so I'm doing it one last time
04-12-2020T00:22:31,Nekonny,then I'm done
04-12-2020T00:23:49,Roughlandin,"You can do it, Ron! We believe! :ptv-hearts:"
04-12-2020T00:24:44,SageSaga,sorry- went to get some food and i saw someone left a bunch of steak knives - in water- in the sink -_-
04-12-2020T00:24:58,SageSaga,had to wash them and dry them before they started to get rust
04-12-2020T00:25:33,CrRAR,arg
04-12-2020T00:25:34,ZRO4825,I'd be more concerned 'bout the knives being in the dishwater. That's one of my biggest pet peeves. WAY too easy to get cut on them that way. <_<;;;
04-12-2020T00:25:39,Nekonny,yikes
04-12-2020T00:25:46,Nekonny,"ok, so skin first I guess ^^"
04-12-2020T00:26:26,Roughlandin,Oof. I can sympathise. My best friends gave me a good set of kitchen knives as a Birthday/Dogsitting present. Fighting rust is a fulltime job
04-12-2020T00:26:43,Nekonny,lets see if I remember how to do this

04-12-2020T00:29:08,Roughlandin,As all things should be
04-12-2020T00:29:36,SpazztasticKiwi,he’s giving me a look that says he somehow knows I forgot the kibble
04-12-2020T00:29:44,NezumiYuki,I wonder if Nyna likes ear scratches?  or would that be considered specist?
04-12-2020T00:30:04,Roughlandin,Your punishment is to be furniture
04-12-2020T00:30:27,Tharkis,always pat da cat :ctharkis-uneasy:

04-12-2020T00:31:54,SpazztasticKiwi,sounds like a magical phenomenon indeed
04-12-2020T00:31:55,Roughlandin,It happens every night. Almost like it was planned

04-12-2020T00:32:25,SpazztasticKiwi,he likes to out-moon the moon
04-12-2020T00:32:36,Ordithus,ha
04-12-2020T00:33:12,Nekonny,I forget... do image maps need to be exclusive?
04-12-2020T00:33:15,Tharkis,"okies i'm about to crawl in bed, g'nigh tall !"

04-12-2020T00:35:49,EpicFail,i know you can see it when the mesh is selected directly
04-12-2020T00:36:01,EpicFail,"theres also a button to reveal it, but, it changes how you select and move things."
04-12-2020T00:36:28,EpicFail,yeaaaah there you go
04-12-2020T00:36:37,EpicFail,UV tools in this need some.. adjustment
04-12-2020T00:36:39,Nekonny,this is the old version
04-12-2020T00:36:44,Nekonny,trying to remember how I did it
04-12-2020T00:36:48,EpicFail,i like the floral detail
04-12-2020T00:37:15,Nekonny,"thanks, reproducing it by hand was a pain but worth it"
04-12-2020T00:37:17,Roughlandin,"Ooh yeah, sweet scrollwork"
04-12-2020T00:37:44,Nekonny,like
04-12-2020T00:37:52,Nekonny,I have the textures
04-12-2020T00:37:58,Nekonny,and it's unwrapped
04-12-2020T00:38:09,Nekonny,but how do I see how its currently unwrapped
04-12-2020T00:38:13,Nekonny,hum
04-12-2020T00:38:29,Nekonny,I am thinking about just making everythign white
04-12-2020T00:38:45,Nekonny,and then adding pats to other textures
04-12-2020T00:38:55,Nekonny,since i don't recal how I did it before
04-12-2020T00:40:18,Roughlandin,Blergh... Matcha buzz wearing off.
04-12-2020T00:40:41,Roughlandin,Man that stuff does pack a punch

04-12-2020T00:44:57,Roughlandin,Yeah. Just be careful in case of aftershocks
04-12-2020T00:45:19,Roughlandin,They pretty regular where you live or is this a rare occurence?
04-12-2020T00:45:54,Nekonny,I feel like I should create a group

04-12-2020T16:32:10,Ordithus,it doesn't help that I stay up late watching streams
04-12-2020T16:32:16,Ordithus,then my body wakes up like I have work
04-12-2020T16:32:43,Roughlandin,It would be nice if internal clocks came with a snooze button
04-12-2020T16:32:59,Ordithus,"someone, invent that!"

04-12-2020T16:33:12,Ordithus,as recent as March I could sleep in
04-12-2020T16:33:25,Ordithus,I guess this is what working from home does to me?
04-12-2020T16:33:57,Roughlandin,I feel that. I've been through a couple weird sleep cycles since going fully at-home
04-12-2020T16:34:11,Roughlandin,Finally looped back around to a semi-normal one
04-12-2020T16:34:37,Roughlandin,But that took basically staying up all night one night to force my body to go to sleep at a decent time the next day
04-12-2020T16:34:43,Ordithus,early morning meetings some days don't help my cause :cw0lfmare-VivianPityme:
04-12-2020T16:35:29,Roughlandin,Blergh. I love mornings. They're the best sleeping hours

04-12-2020T17:50:16,NezumiYuki,Too bad it wasn't the Doctor... I hear he's more lenient about fiddling with time.
04-12-2020T17:51:14,NezumiYuki,Oh speaking of time and all that... I'm curious to learn why Nyna is so eager to get the adventure party rolling that very night even..

04-12-2020T22:51:49,SpazztasticKiwi,dinner for 1-2
04-12-2020T22:52:55,SpazztasticKiwi,https://www.kitsby.com/products/kitsby-x-mike-chen-hotpot-kit
04-12-2020T23:07:28,Roughlandin,Oooh. Might have to grab that. I love hotpot and Mikey's videos
04-12-2020T23:08:22,Ordithus,:cw0lfmare-Echolove:
04-12-2020T23:10:06,Ordithus,"At first I thought the price was absurd, but it includes the pot and ladles"
04-12-2020T23:20:49,Roughlandin,95 bucks is probably about what that spread would cost you if you went and ate at his new restaurant in New York
04-12-2020T23:21:08,Roughlandin,In fact I think the soup bases are the same ones from his place
04-12-2020T23:24:23,Ordithus,The ingredients and sauce are $60.
04-12-2020T23:24:28,Ordithus,I'm not worthy I'm not worthy
04-12-2020T23:25:30,Roughlandin,But it's got SPAM!!!
04-12-2020T23:27:07,Roughlandin,Oh shoot. That's the ONLY meat it comes with lol. I thought the beef and fish cakes and stuff came too
04-12-2020T23:27:14,Roughlandin,...That's less of a good deal
04-12-2020T23:27:29,Roughlandin,But hey... spam!
04-12-2020T23:28:44,Ordithus,tofu really works for hot pots. absorbs the flavors
04-12-2020T23:29:55,Roughlandin,Yis. I made chicken and tofu curry this week. T'were yum.
04-12-2020T23:52:14,SpazztasticKiwi,you actually know who mike is too
04-12-2020T23:54:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I mention him here on occasion but it normally stays about the food
04-12-2020T23:55:09,SpazztasticKiwi,nor did I see anybody actually interested in the box
04-12-2020T23:57:58,Roughlandin,Oh yeah. I watch Strictly Dumpling all the time! Love his stuff!
04-12-2020T23:59:04,Roughlandin,Blergh. Sleepy. :bear::zzz:
04-12-2020T23:59:23,Roughlandin,"Night Ord, Kiwi! See you tomorrow! o/"
