19-07-2020T00:01:15,Dadrobit,"If you're still around, Tom, Thanks kindly for the pick!"
19-07-2020T00:01:19,johnnytho,Sick:sunglasses:
19-07-2020T00:01:29,Roughlandin,It's good dad. Some spicy West Basitin babes. Or... parts of them.

19-07-2020T00:03:02,SpazztasticKiwi,omnipollpular
19-07-2020T00:03:05,Ordithus,you got more than double mine :ctwokinds-clovisgirl_shake:
19-07-2020T00:03:25,Roughlandin,Same
19-07-2020T00:03:41,Dadrobit,:o
19-07-2020T00:03:50,Ordithus,imma change that suggestion up for when I come back to it
19-07-2020T00:03:56,Dadrobit,What will I spend all my internet points on?
19-07-2020T00:04:07,Ordithus,don't spend them all in one place
19-07-2020T00:04:07,Roughlandin,More ways to traumatize Maddie?
19-07-2020T00:04:18,SpazztasticKiwi,things you don’t need
19-07-2020T00:04:27,SpazztasticKiwi,that’s how everyone spends em
19-07-2020T00:04:46,Roughlandin,A decorative lamp in the shape of Flora's legs and booty?
19-07-2020T00:05:14,Dadrobit,"Nah, that was all I wanted to do with Maddie. I wasn't expecting two to go back to back."
19-07-2020T00:05:14,KeefMcDerpface,heh
19-07-2020T00:05:23,SpazztasticKiwi,what if
19-07-2020T00:05:38,Roughlandin,"Somebody was calling for a sequel. You might have started a series, Dad"
19-07-2020T00:05:46,SpazztasticKiwi,we got a “random unknown light switch” in the mansion sketch
19-07-2020T00:05:47,KeefMcDerpface,yep
19-07-2020T00:06:23,SpazztasticKiwi,I won’t say what it does but I got some unfortunate plans for a certain fox
19-07-2020T00:06:24,Roughlandin,"The series ends with Maddie up on the stage, having gone full native"
19-07-2020T00:06:25,Ordithus,I want to see what she was
19-07-2020T00:06:27,Ordithus,*saw
19-07-2020T00:06:34,KeefMcDerpface,"""Oh... What does it do?"" - Maddie and/or Maren"
19-07-2020T00:06:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom did say it was based on an old anime dance scene
19-07-2020T00:06:51,KeefMcDerpface,*Karen
19-07-2020T00:07:02,Ordithus,"Laura springs back to life and then ded again, right :ctwokinds-keith8D:"
19-07-2020T00:07:07,Dadrobit,Does unfortunate plans just mean that they get woken up by some asshole playing with their light switch?
19-07-2020T00:07:12,KeefMcDerpface,That got dark.
19-07-2020T00:07:33,Roughlandin,Lol. Laura get reincarnated and then immediately falls off a cliff or something
19-07-2020T00:07:46,KeefMcDerpface,Willow kills her.
19-07-2020T00:08:07,Roughlandin,"Willow: ""WHY DOES THIS KEEP HAPPENING TO MY FRIENDS!!!"""
19-07-2020T00:08:14,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-keifacepalm: figured that keith was as good a sarcasm mark as any
19-07-2020T00:08:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom if I change my sketch should I put it here for you to see later or is your patreon messages reasonable enough you’ll get it & see it there
19-07-2020T00:08:59,Dadrobit,:o just saw the sketch reveal animation! Such production value!
19-07-2020T00:09:14,Roughlandin,I'd just write it on patreon when the next form goes up. Next week is color stream though.
19-07-2020T00:10:07,Ordithus,"kiwi's patreon is borked, rough"
19-07-2020T00:10:09,Ordithus,badly
19-07-2020T00:10:24,SpazztasticKiwi,"the reason I have to tell Tom directly is for the past week, I can’t see anything I pay for"
19-07-2020T00:10:38,Roughlandin,Oh. I thought you just couldn't access the form
19-07-2020T00:10:41,Roughlandin,My bad
19-07-2020T00:10:49,SpazztasticKiwi,despite my tier showing as active
19-07-2020T00:10:52,SpazztasticKiwi,and paid for
19-07-2020T00:10:58,Roughlandin,That's weird. Patreon sucks yo
19-07-2020T00:11:27,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m tempted to try the turn it off/turn it back on method but that might be why I’m in this mess
19-07-2020T00:11:37,Roughlandin,Have you contacted support?
19-07-2020T00:11:39,SpazztasticKiwi,double charging in one month
19-07-2020T00:11:56,SpazztasticKiwi,"as good as they’re doing me, I haven’t"
19-07-2020T00:12:38,SpazztasticKiwi,"or rather, I’m better off not having contacted them at all"
19-07-2020T00:12:56,Roughlandin,They just shrug and ask you to submit a ticket?
19-07-2020T00:13:16,Dadrobit,"Holy crap, 7 and a half hours?"
19-07-2020T00:13:25,Roughlandin,Twas a long one. Yus.
19-07-2020T00:13:26,Ordithus,and 6/7 sketches
19-07-2020T00:13:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I have two “thanks for the support ticket we’ll contact you when we can”
19-07-2020T00:13:57,Ordithus,much devotion to each piece
19-07-2020T00:14:18,Roughlandin,Well so much is screwed up on Patreon I imagine it'd take them a while to get to you lol.
19-07-2020T00:14:32,Dadrobit,"Oh, did I meantion LabCorp finally got back to me on my support ticket for my Covid results?"
19-07-2020T00:14:35,SpazztasticKiwi,"then a few days later it was “just letting you know, we received your ticket but there “”could”” be a delay due to coronavirus/an increase in tickets”"
19-07-2020T00:14:47,Roughlandin,I'd wait till the end of this month. Unsub. And then resub in August.
19-07-2020T00:15:09,Dadrobit,"3 weeks after the test, they sent me an email saying my results were ready three weeks ago."
19-07-2020T00:15:12,Roughlandin,@Dadrobit They lose your test result?
19-07-2020T00:15:25,Ordithus,"man, they're on top of it"
19-07-2020T00:15:29,SpazztasticKiwi,& I’ve checked the ticket numbers against others in the inbox and it doesn’t match so I’m not looking at an old ticket from what I can tell
19-07-2020T00:15:31,Dadrobit,Negative for what it's worth
19-07-2020T00:15:39,Ordithus,excellent!
19-07-2020T00:15:43,Roughlandin,Whew. Congrats.
19-07-2020T00:15:46,KeefMcDerpface,good
19-07-2020T00:15:52,Dadrobit,The results were done next day.
19-07-2020T00:15:55,Ordithus,my nephew and brother in law are hopefully negative...
19-07-2020T00:16:04,Ordithus,both are sick now with symptoms
19-07-2020T00:16:16,Dadrobit,The hospital was helpful in getting them for me at least.
19-07-2020T00:16:27,Roughlandin,"Oof. Sorry to hear, Ord"
19-07-2020T00:16:45,Ordithus,"Thanks!  Neither are very sick, at least"
19-07-2020T00:16:48,Dadrobit,:/ Best of luck Ord. This is all very no bueno
19-07-2020T00:16:48,AspiringNoodle,This makes me a horrible person
19-07-2020T00:16:52,Roughlandin,Well that's good
19-07-2020T00:17:15,AspiringNoodle,But I honestly hope that the people who willfully chose to ignore wearing a mask and mocked the pandemic are the ones who need an ICU bed when there are none :/
19-07-2020T00:17:17,Dadrobit,"Spazz, good luck. Patreon's automated support is a pile of hot garbage in my experience."
19-07-2020T00:17:45,Roughlandin,My brother waited on his forever. He came home from California a few weeks ago and had to self-quarantine until his results came back.
19-07-2020T00:18:04,Roughlandin,Negative. Thankfully
19-07-2020T00:18:08,AspiringNoodle,Woo~
19-07-2020T00:18:19,SpazztasticKiwi,"I shite you not tho, the month before I contacted them about a one time charge I added on my account (it charged but also mentioned a “credit” so I was confused)"
19-07-2020T00:18:32,SpazztasticKiwi,they got back to me in like 24/48 hours almost
19-07-2020T00:18:42,SpazztasticKiwi,let me look at the timeframe for sure
19-07-2020T00:20:13,Dadrobit,Man I wish Picarto had a scrubbing preview for their vods
19-07-2020T00:20:26,Roughlandin,"Dang, it's past 1am here. Think I'm gonna call it a night. See everybody tomorrow night at 9!"
19-07-2020T00:20:30,Ordithus,night rough
19-07-2020T00:20:31,Roughlandin,o/
19-07-2020T00:20:35,Dadrobit,o/ Rough
19-07-2020T00:20:39,KeefMcDerpface,bye Rough
19-07-2020T00:21:16,KeefMcDerpface,It's getting late for me too. Night all.
19-07-2020T00:21:28,Dadrobit,o/ Keef
19-07-2020T00:21:29,SpazztasticKiwi,or that email is missing so nm
19-07-2020T00:21:31,Ordithus,night keef
19-07-2020T00:22:39,johnnytho,If you reuse green tea leaves too many times it starts to taste like chicken soup:nauseated_face:
19-07-2020T00:27:59,Ordithus,but chicken soup is good
19-07-2020T00:31:18,SpazztasticKiwi,honestly debating if patreon is even worth it on behalf of how much of $10 actually goes to Tom
19-07-2020T00:31:40,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s them I’d like to have a come to Jesus meeting with
19-07-2020T00:32:23,Dadrobit,I imagine it's around 80% goes to Tom?
19-07-2020T00:41:42,AspiringNoodle,I believe it's 30%?
19-07-2020T00:41:49,AspiringNoodle,"30% to Patreon, I mean"
19-07-2020T00:42:10,AspiringNoodle,"Oh wow, we're both far off, I'm thinking Youtube's super chats, lol"
19-07-2020T00:42:14,AspiringNoodle,Patreon is just a paltry 5%
19-07-2020T00:42:30,Dadrobit,"Wow, that's incredibly generous."
19-07-2020T00:45:34,Ordithus,taxes are waaay more
19-07-2020T00:48:36,Dadrobit,"Yeah, 20% for self employment."
19-07-2020T00:49:12,Dadrobit,He might even pay more tbh
19-07-2020T00:49:19,Ordithus,"ah, didn't think about that.  double hit on payroll, and have to pay own ""benefits"""
19-07-2020T00:49:44,Dadrobit,I only had to pay 20% since I was a failure lol.
19-07-2020T00:50:43,AspiringNoodle,"Patreon *could* try bumping up their take to 10%, would still be super generous compared to platforms like YouTube where they take 30% of any money you get from superchats"
19-07-2020T00:51:05,AspiringNoodle,"But at the same time, it probably won't save the company since they're wasting money on useless employees and keep booting off more and more creators"
19-07-2020T00:51:12,AspiringNoodle,And as a result scaring more and more away xD
19-07-2020T00:51:53,AspiringNoodle,I do worry for Tom
19-07-2020T00:55:48,AspiringNoodle,"He might be safe as one of the bigger names on the platform, but you never know when they're gonna change the ToS and might pressure him to change"
19-07-2020T01:28:09,SpazztasticKiwi,I thought of a suggestion that would make the stream hate me

19-07-2020T02:31:37,AspiringNoodle,Apparently I need to watch Rise of the TMNT
19-07-2020T02:31:54,AspiringNoodle,"Just saw an action sequence from a recent episode.  Mind blown, that's anime quality stuff right there"
19-07-2020T02:32:24,AspiringNoodle,I've noticed that more cartoons here in the west are starting to have episodes with action sequences that feel pulled straight out of Japan
19-07-2020T03:11:56,DarthRexKing,night all.

19-07-2020T15:27:23,SpazztasticKiwi,because last night I came home at 6 & it was empty so it had to crawled in at the night and early morning hours before 12

19-07-2020T18:40:48,Ordithus,Is Clovis actually capable of love?
19-07-2020T18:40:57,Twokinds,He loves money.

19-07-2020T18:41:39,w0lfmare,Does this mean Brutus is out of the guild?
19-07-2020T18:41:41,Ordithus,a real romantic

19-07-2020T18:42:32,Twokinds,"So I guess Brutus would have to be relabled as Clovis' personal girl. Which, I guess wouldn't change much."
19-07-2020T18:42:34,TeapotOfDoom,would clovis disguise him or just kick him out
19-07-2020T18:42:41,AspiringNoodle,That's what I was thinking
19-07-2020T18:42:41,TeapotOfDoom,makes sense
19-07-2020T18:42:45,Paxpup,"Personal maid for Clovis. ""Boss this is your wake up call"""

19-07-2020T18:42:55,AspiringNoodle,"Move Brutus to a more personal role, but still gives him reason to be nearby at all times"

19-07-2020T18:43:10,steelabjur,"Clovis, to his other men: ""Um, this is Brutus' sister! Yeah, that works!"""
19-07-2020T18:43:38,Paxpup,Her name is also Brutus
19-07-2020T18:43:53,Twokinds,"Wolves in Twokinds are quite sexist, especially in both the upperclass and the underworld, somewhat ironically, the two ends of the societal spectrum."
19-07-2020T18:44:12,TeapotOfDoom,so not as bad in the middle then?
19-07-2020T18:44:16,TeapotOfDoom,probably still bad tho
19-07-2020T18:44:18,Paxpup,Their parents suck at names...
19-07-2020T18:44:19,Twokinds,"The middle is a bit less strict since you know, normal folk are just trying to get on with life."
19-07-2020T18:44:30,Ordithus,Was Sythe upper class?
19-07-2020T18:44:36,Ordithus,"Before the whole, traitor thing"
19-07-2020T18:44:42,Rainelover,Let’s hope the rest of the chauvinistic members of Clovis’s clan doesn’t find out about  brutes’s “predicament” otherwise some... less than savory things... are almost certainly going to be forced upon her...
19-07-2020T18:44:50,CrimsonHelsing,She's cute x3
19-07-2020T18:44:55,Ordithus,He sure goes outside the mold.  He's a good boy
19-07-2020T18:44:58,Twokinds,"Sythe was, yes. A relative of a minor noble."
19-07-2020T18:45:24,AspiringNoodle,"Brutus may be extra squish, but he can still squish *you*"
19-07-2020T18:45:27,Paxpup,"I mean he was supposed to marry Flora, so I'd imagine high up."
19-07-2020T18:45:41,BadFoMo,"Back. Also, inb4 we find out that most of Clovis' gang are women pretending to be men?"
19-07-2020T18:45:52,w0lfmare,Not a particularly impressive boast
19-07-2020T18:45:52,steelabjur,"In Sythe's case, living and being interested in Humans probably made him more liberal than his peers."
