18-04-2020T12:49:44,AspiringNoodle,"Typical sci-fi plot.  Giant government faction overseeing all the planets in the system is an a-hole, and either A) doesn't give 2 craps about the outposts or B - Is actively letting the threat take out said outposts for reasons"

18-04-2020T23:16:15,AspiringNoodle,Oh lord help me...
18-04-2020T23:16:17,SpazztasticKiwi,so did anyone else catch Marks story about the day he stuck his hand in a bee bush
18-04-2020T23:17:03,AspiringNoodle,"Also, love that sign, Kiwi"
18-04-2020T23:17:10,ProsePro7,What is a bee bush?
18-04-2020T23:17:11,AspiringNoodle,And Samoas are king :ptv-condescending:
18-04-2020T23:17:21,SpazztasticKiwi,...a bush...
18-04-2020T23:17:27,SpazztasticKiwi,..with bees..
18-04-2020T23:17:32,Ordithus,made of bees?
18-04-2020T23:17:41,SpazztasticKiwi,WiTh
18-04-2020T23:17:56,ProsePro7,...all I can see is Nicholas Cage screaming
18-04-2020T23:18:03,SpazztasticKiwi,"as he described it, “full of bees”"
18-04-2020T23:18:26,SpazztasticKiwi,talking about “I got this - im an expert”
18-04-2020T23:19:00,SpazztasticKiwi,which is evidently what he said right before he got hurt as a kid
18-04-2020T23:19:05,SpazztasticKiwi,and I believe it
18-04-2020T23:19:17,Ordithus,catch phrase of doom
18-04-2020T23:20:07,SpazztasticKiwi,like the bees were gonna come out buzzing in a line whistling together like he’s a disney princess
18-04-2020T23:21:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"since he didn’t elaborate on the story, I wonder what the rest was"
18-04-2020T23:21:28,SpazztasticKiwi,besides “I got stung...lots”
18-04-2020T23:21:33,Ordithus,^
18-04-2020T23:22:06,Ordithus,though bees are usually pretty chill unless you go for their hive
18-04-2020T23:22:13,SpazztasticKiwi,that was it
18-04-2020T23:22:20,Ordithus,"oh, well then"
18-04-2020T23:22:36,SpazztasticKiwi,"if it was a “bee bush”, it was in all likelihood the hive"
18-04-2020T23:22:44,SpazztasticKiwi,that happened to be in a bush
18-04-2020T23:23:32,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s just good he didn’t find out he was allergic to bees that day
18-04-2020T23:29:59,ProsePro7,Alright Im out.  Night all
18-04-2020T23:30:03,DarthRexKing,Me too.

18-04-2020T23:35:25,SpazztasticKiwi,"here recently, I got to looking up Seáns brother Malcom"
18-04-2020T23:37:20,SpazztasticKiwi,"he’s been absent since December & with him having two kids and being a little older than Seán, I began to get an inkling as to how the chaos was effecting him"
18-04-2020T23:38:56,SpazztasticKiwi,"he’s been off the internet since, is all - book signings and seminars nonexistent until who knows"
18-04-2020T23:40:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"but ay, I’m off to stream captain marvel as a blanket burrito"
