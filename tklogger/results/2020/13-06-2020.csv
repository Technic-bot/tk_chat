13-06-2020T16:05:54,ThingsAreMoving,But that tends to happen pretty often to people with pitch black hair like me
13-06-2020T16:06:16,BlackjackSec99,ive got some greys at 32
13-06-2020T16:06:16,RimaDraws,https://twokinds.gallery/download/art/1920/2020.05.02_Rose_Reference_Sheet.png
13-06-2020T16:06:40,RimaDraws,but yea its actually 30 i thought
13-06-2020T16:06:40,Roughlandin,No usually max 30. Euchre is likely lying about his age and Rose is looking really good for a 28 year old Keidran. Probably magic.
13-06-2020T16:06:44,BlackjackSec99,"yes, rose is  quite well aged"
13-06-2020T16:06:56,Ordithus,like a fine wine
13-06-2020T16:06:58,RimaDraws,i aged we
13-06-2020T16:07:00,RimaDraws,well*
13-06-2020T16:07:04,RimaDraws,my sister not so much
13-06-2020T16:07:07,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-rose::wine_glass:
13-06-2020T16:07:16,ProsePro7,"What I am asking is last I heard 20 was the average life span.  Laura said as much when she said she was looking for Keith for 5 years a ""quarter of a lifetime"""
13-06-2020T16:07:20,Roughlandin,I'm 28 and I'm falling apart lol
13-06-2020T16:07:24,RimaDraws,my sister has more grey hairs and she's 28
13-06-2020T16:07:30,BlackjackSec99,Ord... Im not going to say what im thinking about that
13-06-2020T16:07:32,Roughlandin,No current canon is 30 Prose
13-06-2020T16:07:41,RimaDraws,i have had maybe a couple white hairs fall out but no grey yet and i am almost 33
13-06-2020T16:07:41,ProsePro7,Okay retcon it is
13-06-2020T16:07:54,BlackjackSec99,"Rima, youre my age?"
13-06-2020T16:07:57,BlackjackSec99,neat!
13-06-2020T16:07:57,ShamusTheFox,"Raine is a human who can perfect  transform into a Keidran. She will have a regular lifespan. If her Keidran form matches that, what will her Keidran form be like at 60?"
13-06-2020T16:08:01,Ordithus,It is! Tom changed the text in a few places for that
13-06-2020T16:08:03,RimaDraws,yea i'm 32
13-06-2020T16:08:03,Dadrobit,"30 is canon as the upper bounds, it's like finding someone over 100 years old though."
13-06-2020T16:08:05,RimaDraws,an old fart
13-06-2020T16:08:10,ProsePro7,Most of us are close to Tom in age...I think
13-06-2020T16:08:11,ThingsAreMoving,"Rough, wait till you hit 30. You basically roll a d6 on your every birthday and see how many new ailments you get"
13-06-2020T16:08:13,BlackjackSec99,"same, 33 in october"
13-06-2020T16:08:21,Dadrobit,So 20 to mid 20's is where most will perish
13-06-2020T16:08:23,RimaDraws,33 in september
13-06-2020T16:08:24,Ordithus,"Shamus, that is as far as we know, wrong"
13-06-2020T16:08:25,BlackjackSec99,"^thing, accurate"
13-06-2020T16:08:30,BadFoMo,@Ordithus Changed what text where?
13-06-2020T16:08:38,ThingsAreMoving,"Also, they stack"
13-06-2020T16:08:48,BlackjackSec99,yeo
13-06-2020T16:08:49,BlackjackSec99,yep
13-06-2020T16:08:55,RimaDraws,someone at work thought i was 23 i said lol no
13-06-2020T16:09:00,Ordithus,"Some references to how long Keidran last, I believe.  Might not be in the web version.  I can't recall entirely, so take my words with a pint of salt"
13-06-2020T16:09:01,ProsePro7,That is interesting how we are all roughly plus or minus 5 years of each other
13-06-2020T16:09:04,ShamusTheFox,@Ordithus Can you clarify?
13-06-2020T16:09:25,Dadrobit,"And it's pretty likely that there's something funky foinf on with Euchre being so old, and perhaps even Rose."
13-06-2020T16:09:25,ProsePro7,How about a kg of salt
13-06-2020T16:09:27,Roughlandin,Rose's ref sheet had something on it right?
13-06-2020T16:09:29,Ordithus,"Well, Raine can transform, but she ages entirely as a human"
13-06-2020T16:09:32,Dadrobit,going on*
13-06-2020T16:09:38,Ordithus,Rose and Euchre have aged entirely like Keidran
13-06-2020T16:09:59,Katfeathers,"Almost all, Dec will bring my 50th"
13-06-2020T16:10:00,ThingsAreMoving,I wonder if Euchre's perfect transformation don't allow him to extend his age to human years whan he's in human form
13-06-2020T16:10:09,Roughlandin,"Yeah Raine's ref sheet says she was born human, right? Thus human lifespan"
13-06-2020T16:10:10,ThingsAreMoving,"Same goes to Rose, to some extent"
13-06-2020T16:10:15,ProsePro7,But Euchre told Flora he was nearing the end of his life and that he has lived longer than he should have already so there is that
13-06-2020T16:10:30,Roughlandin,Euchre also lies. About like everything.
13-06-2020T16:10:39,RimaDraws,lol
13-06-2020T16:10:43,ShamusTheFox,I get that Raine ages as a human. But does the Keidran form actually age? Or will it stay forever young?
13-06-2020T16:10:46,Roughlandin,Because Euchre is a bastard man
13-06-2020T16:10:54,Ordithus,"Euchre, at like 8 or so, dated Mary and had a kid.  Not normal human 8 year old htings"
13-06-2020T16:10:58,Dadrobit,Euchre did nothing wrong
13-06-2020T16:11:04,CrRAR,lol
13-06-2020T16:11:04,KeefMcDerpface,:ptv-shock: You mean he lied about his name?!
13-06-2020T16:11:13,Roughlandin,It's actually Chad
13-06-2020T16:11:30,ProsePro7,"I'm not pick on the inconsistencies, Tom has be making this for 16 years God knows I have inconsistencies in my own stuff too probably many more"
13-06-2020T16:11:31,Roughlandin,#FakeLore
13-06-2020T16:11:44,ProsePro7,picking
13-06-2020T16:11:46,Ordithus,Point being - Euchre is a wolf.  Raine is a human.  Their apparent age is consistent between forms
13-06-2020T16:11:56,Ordithus,"Such as kid is kid, adult is adult"
13-06-2020T16:12:01,Ordithus,Old geezer is old geezer
13-06-2020T16:12:24,Roughlandin,"If Euchre was the age he claimed to be, he'd have sired Raine at like 3 years old. Which has... implications..."
13-06-2020T16:12:32,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm 23 and grey but I got Cherokee
13-06-2020T16:13:05,BlackjackSec99,unless that perticular line of wolves ages VERY differently
13-06-2020T16:13:07,ShamusTheFox,"Ah, so maybe it's not a 1 to 1 ratio of aging, so to speak."
13-06-2020T16:13:34,Dadrobit,https://i.imgur.com/o1vf3Fa.png found it
13-06-2020T16:13:38,Ordithus,So Euchre is not gonna live as long as a human can.  And Raine isn't going to die of old age in a couple years
13-06-2020T16:14:05,KeefMcDerpface,Interesting.
13-06-2020T16:14:06,Dadrobit,"So yeah, There's almost certainly something funky with Euchre"
13-06-2020T16:14:11,Roughlandin,Unless Euchre HAS found a way to make himself magically immortal
13-06-2020T16:14:25,KeefMcDerpface,The fountain of youth?
13-06-2020T16:14:26,SpazztasticKiwi,demons
13-06-2020T16:14:39,Roughlandin,Which isn't impossible on Mekkan. Y'know. Dragons n junk.
13-06-2020T16:14:43,ShamusTheFox,"Given that Euchre is meddling with Mask affairs, I'm not surprised there is something funky with him."
13-06-2020T16:14:48,BlackjackSec99,praise be to SCP-682 for making him long lived
13-06-2020T16:14:57,Katfeathers,"Irl wolves, dogs, and cats don't age at a fixed ratio either"
13-06-2020T16:15:33,BadFoMo,What if Euchre /is/ a Mask?!
13-06-2020T16:15:37,Dadrobit,"As for Euchre being with Mary at a young age, yeah, Keidran are considered adults at 90 months or 7.5 years, so 8 is definitely icky as a human, but Keidran..."
13-06-2020T16:17:20,Roughlandin,It's weird how many people don't get keidran aging. I remember somebody taking serious offense when the Maddie/Maeve future-ship started taking off
13-06-2020T16:17:20,Dadrobit,"Also, he was more like 9-11 since Rose is 8-9 in the flashback with Euchre first heading off to the Templar."
13-06-2020T16:18:01,Dadrobit,Keidran aging is still kind of an icky concept for me tbh.
13-06-2020T16:18:17,ProsePro7,Flora is 11 and pregnant
13-06-2020T16:18:18,Ordithus,"Biology does not beget maturity, yeah"
13-06-2020T16:18:19,BadFoMo,Same.
13-06-2020T16:18:35,Dadrobit,"Regardless of physical age, a person who only has 11 years of life experience is still just 11."
13-06-2020T16:18:41,Roughlandin,It's no different than elves in other fantasy worlds. Just opposite timescale
13-06-2020T16:18:53,BlackjackSec99,or hobbits
13-06-2020T16:18:53,Roughlandin,Humans are like keidran's version of elves
13-06-2020T16:18:58,Ordithus,Granted a 4 year old dog acts with more maturity than a 9 year old kid
13-06-2020T16:19:06,BlackjackSec99,hobbits arent mature till something like 30?
13-06-2020T16:19:10,ProsePro7,Interspecies Reviewers?
13-06-2020T16:19:11,Dadrobit,Probably the one thing I'd wish Tom would retcon is add 10 years to the age cap and throw the years on the primary characters.
13-06-2020T16:19:19,BadFoMo,That's one of the reasons why my anthros age like Humans (for the most part).
13-06-2020T16:19:34,Dadrobit,"Ord, that's objectively wrong my dude lol."
13-06-2020T16:19:35,Rainelover,The fountain of euchre?
13-06-2020T16:19:37,Ordithus,haha
13-06-2020T16:19:53,ProsePro7,That is something we can add to the Modern Day AU all Keidran age like humans
13-06-2020T16:19:53,Ordithus,Have you met kids - they be crazy
13-06-2020T16:20:01,BlackjackSec99,"Dadro, you havent met my 8 year old daughter...."
13-06-2020T16:20:14,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I have like 20 nieces and nephew in that age range. None of them eat their own shit."
13-06-2020T16:20:21,Dadrobit,Dogs however
13-06-2020T16:20:23,Ordithus,Hmm touche
13-06-2020T16:20:25,KeefMcDerpface,pfffft
13-06-2020T16:20:26,Roughlandin,As far as you know...
13-06-2020T16:20:34,Katfeathers,Getting older also doesn't mean growing up
13-06-2020T16:20:37,KeefMcDerpface,This took a turn.
13-06-2020T16:20:47,BlackjackSec99,yes it did
13-06-2020T16:21:14,ShamusTheFox,I'm over 40 and I still make up stupid rhymes while I am waiting for my food to cook in the oven. Maturity is not my strong point.
13-06-2020T16:21:22,Ordithus,"But a 4 year old dog is perfectly capable or raising more doggos, a 9 year old kid can't even be left alone"

13-06-2020T16:22:18,BadFoMo,"@ProsePro7 It the far future of 1999, medical advacments have granted Keidran a simliar life span to Humans and Basitins."
13-06-2020T16:22:22,ThingsAreMoving,I figure you can be called an adult/mature if you're self reliant in today's society
13-06-2020T16:22:30,Katfeathers,D'oh!
13-06-2020T16:22:37,Roughlandin,Then I am but a smol child
13-06-2020T16:22:43,Roughlandin,Because I cannot adult
13-06-2020T16:22:50,KeefMcDerpface,same
13-06-2020T16:22:58,KeefMcDerpface,But I won't burn the house down.
13-06-2020T16:23:08,Roughlandin,I am very like a keidran. Smol but pervy

13-06-2020T17:00:34,Rainelover,Alive out there
13-06-2020T17:00:55,Roughlandin,Maddie is all about espionage

13-06-2020T17:03:38,KeefMcDerpface,Also is this the first male West Basitin we seen?
13-06-2020T17:03:55,BlackjackSec99,ohhh
13-06-2020T17:03:56,Ordithus,"I suppose, since Keith is 1/2 western"
13-06-2020T17:03:57,BlackjackSec99,maybe?
13-06-2020T17:03:57,Katfeathers,Flint kin deal with krak-a-thooms.
13-06-2020T17:04:01,BadFoMo,I think so.
13-06-2020T17:04:07,Dadrobit,No
13-06-2020T17:04:14,Roughlandin,...I was about to say no. But I think those guys in the Nat/Adelaide pic were actually East Basitin
13-06-2020T17:04:29,Roughlandin,"So I think so, yeah"
13-06-2020T17:04:45,Stormagedon,I'm Moon Bastian guys
13-06-2020T17:04:56,Dadrobit,"Wait, nevermind, maybe"
13-06-2020T17:04:57,Stormagedon,"idk, just made that up"
13-06-2020T17:05:05,Dadrobit,I was thinking of something else.
13-06-2020T17:05:11,BadFoMo,Unless the 'Side Swap' was a very reasent or comen thing for Basitin.
13-06-2020T17:05:34,Roughlandin,Don't moon Basitin guys. The East basitins would die of shame and the West Basitins might take it as an invitation.
13-06-2020T17:05:53,Roughlandin,Filthy heathens
13-06-2020T17:05:56,Stormagedon,"No, Moon as in the Moon, not the other moon"
13-06-2020T17:05:59,Roughlandin,"Filthy, sexy heathens"
13-06-2020T17:06:10,ShamusTheFox,How many moons?

13-06-2020T17:06:45,ShamusTheFox,Moons Over My Hammy?
13-06-2020T17:06:46,KeefMcDerpface,"Ah, there's Moon."
13-06-2020T17:07:28,Roughlandin,Is it a stellar object? A heavenly body? No! It's... DRAGON BUTT!
13-06-2020T17:07:41,IronHorseComics,"MMm, butt"
13-06-2020T17:07:42,KeefMcDerpface,...
13-06-2020T17:07:50,microbuss,TIGER BUTT!!
13-06-2020T17:07:53,Stormagedon,Does the world of TK have more then one moon?
13-06-2020T17:08:02,Roughlandin,And thus begins the nightly buttchat
13-06-2020T17:08:02,microbuss,hehe hellos
13-06-2020T17:08:04,Rainelover,"When you think about it, jade could easily just make the east basitan empire a heretical monarchy if she wanted, I mean, who‚Äôs going to stop her?"
13-06-2020T17:08:10,KeefMcDerpface,Hello micro
13-06-2020T17:08:12,Roughlandin,Welcome micro

13-06-2020T17:08:51,ShamusTheFox,Heya!
13-06-2020T17:08:52,Roughlandin,The summoning ritual was successful!
13-06-2020T17:08:57,KeefMcDerpface,lol
13-06-2020T17:08:57,Dadrobit,"@Raine, anyone who challenges her I suppose."
13-06-2020T17:08:57,Roughlandin,HERESY!
13-06-2020T17:09:00,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,Hi Heresy
13-06-2020T17:09:08,Dadrobit,o/ Heresy
13-06-2020T17:09:10,BadFoMo,"@Stormagedon I think it did when the story was starting, but I think that's been ret-conned."
13-06-2020T17:09:12,Stormagedon,"This is an important question, How many moons? just one or more, like Tamriel?"
13-06-2020T17:09:12,BlackjackSec99,lots of people! hello all
13-06-2020T17:09:41,KeefMcDerpface,There's the real Moon and then the fake moon that really a space station.
13-06-2020T17:09:54,Roughlandin,That's where Tom runs his pizza empire
13-06-2020T17:09:58,KeefMcDerpface,lol
13-06-2020T17:10:01,Stormagedon,"Naw keef, it just Nora"
13-06-2020T17:10:22,Roughlandin,Nora wanted her own moon so she bought one
13-06-2020T17:10:29,Roughlandin,With her booty
13-06-2020T17:10:34,Stormagedon,^
13-06-2020T17:10:54,Stormagedon,Butt chat is back
13-06-2020T17:11:00,MoonDance,Nora hops around the moon whole straddling a spoon
13-06-2020T17:11:01,Rainelover,@Dadrobit and who in their right mind would challenge a giant like Adelaide?!
13-06-2020T17:11:04,Ordithus,Who needs a hoard when you have a sky-high credit limit
13-06-2020T17:11:04,Roughlandin,"Buttchat never left, baby"
13-06-2020T17:11:10,KeefMcDerpface,So that's what happened to the third Death Star. Nora bought it.
13-06-2020T17:11:29,Roughlandin,Who is gonna have the guts to give a dragon a bad credit score?
13-06-2020T17:11:31,Dadrobit,Presumably one of the Master Generals.
13-06-2020T17:12:06,Katfeathers,:ctwokinds-NoraEyebrows:
13-06-2020T17:12:07,Dadrobit,We know that Jade wasn't entirely unique in her giantism.
13-06-2020T17:12:09,MoonDance,Maybe neutral
13-06-2020T17:12:10,Twokinds,Nora owns her own bank
13-06-2020T17:12:13,Stormagedon,Its like the appraiser with the dragon horde. No one is gonna say a dragon's horde is worthless
13-06-2020T17:12:27,ThingsAreMoving,:ctwokinds-NoraEyebrows: wanna get some... credit?
13-06-2020T17:12:30,unsteddyphoenix,"mm, I believe that"
13-06-2020T17:12:31,Twokinds,3000 years of interest
13-06-2020T17:12:32,Ordithus,Does she offer free checking?
13-06-2020T17:12:49,Stormagedon,Thats alota interest
13-06-2020T17:13:09,Roughlandin,Owns her own bank. Lives in a two bedroom apartment as the house cat. Makes sense.
13-06-2020T17:13:13,unsteddyphoenix,Nora probably just has so many assets under like 14 different names
13-06-2020T17:13:20,Rainelover,"And assuming they do? How do you think that will end, we are talking about a woman who toppled and entire tower with her bare hands"
13-06-2020T17:13:20,KeefMcDerpface,"hehe, Kevin is trying to shield his eyes of the cute."
13-06-2020T17:13:40,Ordithus,Jade was really ill before the tower was destroyed
13-06-2020T17:13:42,Dadrobit,She has offshore accounts in Western Bsaitin lands for tax evasion purposes for sure.
13-06-2020T17:13:56,KeefMcDerpface,:ptv-shock:
13-06-2020T17:13:58,ThingsAreMoving,I wouldn't be surprised if She had several pocket dimensions filled with stuff valueable to her
13-06-2020T17:14:00,KeefMcDerpface,Lady Nora?!
13-06-2020T17:14:01,Stormagedon,Who would tax a dragon
13-06-2020T17:14:19,KeefMcDerpface,Another Dragon?
13-06-2020T17:14:23,AspiringNoodle,"In Mekkan, dragon tax you"
13-06-2020T17:14:24,Rainelover,Someone with a deathwish
13-06-2020T17:14:29,KeefMcDerpface,But very unlikely.
13-06-2020T17:14:31,Katfeathers,"Nah, she makes sure at the end of tax season they owe her"
13-06-2020T17:14:31,AspiringNoodle,in bed ;D
13-06-2020T17:14:43,AspiringNoodle,"LOL, that perfect timing"
13-06-2020T17:14:59,KeefMcDerpface,hehehe
13-06-2020T17:15:01,Katfeathers,:ckatfeathers-Kat_thumbsup:
13-06-2020T17:15:04,Dadrobit,Jade isn't exactly a spring chicken anymore. There would be challengers.
13-06-2020T17:15:37,Dadrobit,"Even if Maddie did manage to inherit the crown, it would just take someone challenging her instead"
13-06-2020T17:15:38,microbuss,"well neither are any of us in here, Dadro lol"
13-06-2020T17:15:58,AspiringNoodle,My response: Who would challenge someone who destroyed a tower with their bare hands?
13-06-2020T17:16:09,AspiringNoodle,That sounds like a great way to get yeeted into the side of a mountain
13-06-2020T17:16:26,Roughlandin,"Headcanon: Alaric has a super secret plan with Adelaide. When all the pieces are in place, a filing for a challenge will come through. Which Jade will accept and then immediately forfeit. Making the new king... Keith."
13-06-2020T17:16:27,unsteddyphoenix,Isnt Jade like...a 1/1000000 genetic miracle though?
13-06-2020T17:16:53,Roughlandin,Or better yet. Natani. All Hail the Basitin King!
13-06-2020T17:16:56,ThingsAreMoving,She's be blessed with the Plot chromosome
13-06-2020T17:17:18,KeefMcDerpface,The most OP of chromosomes.
13-06-2020T17:17:18,Dadrobit,It is a common enough affliction that Musclehead General was a thing. And it was something that the other generals were counting on Maddie inheriting before she was born.
13-06-2020T17:17:43,microbuss,I found DVDs today!
13-06-2020T17:17:43,Stormagedon,"I plaied one round of World of tanks, and I come back to be confused"
13-06-2020T17:17:56,MuonNeutrino,"musclehead general was big and strong, but not a genetic anomaly like adelaide IMO"
13-06-2020T17:18:00,unsteddyphoenix,The fact that they were so wrong is evidence that its rare
13-06-2020T17:18:10,Ordithus,runt of the litter
13-06-2020T17:18:11,TerraAegis8,Oooh!
13-06-2020T17:18:16,Roughlandin,Confusion is buttchat's natural habitat
13-06-2020T17:18:19,KeefMcDerpface,^
13-06-2020T17:18:25,unsteddyphoenix,They dont even know that its apparently not guarenteed to be geneti
13-06-2020T17:18:26,ShamusTheFox,"It's a bit ironic that because of his West Basitin bloodline, Keith might be best suited to be king, as he doesn't have the same need to follow orders as the rest. He can be a ruler without extra baggage."
13-06-2020T17:18:48,AspiringNoodle,^
13-06-2020T17:18:49,Roughlandin,Keith would be a good king. yus yus.
13-06-2020T17:18:57,Dadrobit,The fact that they were so disappointment tells me that it was expected and her diminutive stature is the anomaly.
13-06-2020T17:19:15,Rainelover,"Yes, but I hardly"
13-06-2020T17:19:33,unsteddyphoenix,Isnt it natural to assume what they did though
13-06-2020T17:19:46,Katfeathers,Aye
13-06-2020T17:19:48,Roughlandin,King Keith and the litany of Basitin legal reforms Alaric has posthumously authored
13-06-2020T17:19:48,Dadrobit,"Also, the Musclehead General definitely had the gene. Dude towered over even Natani."
13-06-2020T17:20:04,Dadrobit,They wouldn't assume it if it were rare.
13-06-2020T17:20:07,Rainelover,bet they would accept a westerner as their king
13-06-2020T17:20:08,Ordithus,Pretty rare for a cabbit
13-06-2020T17:20:15,unsteddyphoenix,I would
13-06-2020T17:20:28,Roughlandin,Isn't it implied that East Basitins practice some form of selective breeding program?
13-06-2020T17:20:34,unsteddyphoenix,Big buff produces big buff offspring? Seems logical
13-06-2020T17:20:58,Katfeathers,"It might be rare, but some would still hope for double or nothing"
13-06-2020T17:21:05,Dadrobit,"I'm not contesting that it's super rare, but I think it is something that is a representable portion of society."
13-06-2020T17:21:20,ThingsAreMoving,Depends if the buff gene is recessive or dominant
13-06-2020T17:21:27,ThingsAreMoving,Genetics can be tricky
13-06-2020T17:21:45,Katfeathers,Also true
13-06-2020T17:22:04,Roughlandin,Stahp. You're giving me AP Bio flashbacks
13-06-2020T17:22:11,KeefMcDerpface,Oh no.

13-06-2020T19:07:10,TeapotOfDoom,a lot
13-06-2020T19:07:20,unsteddyphoenix,So Mike X Raine is the ship that dissapoints the maximum amount of people
13-06-2020T19:07:25,Ordithus,haha
13-06-2020T19:07:25,TeapotOfDoom,he would be called a comodore
13-06-2020T19:07:36,Ordithus,ngl that's a cute ship
13-06-2020T19:07:50,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Mike X Raine is one of my backups
13-06-2020T19:07:52,unsteddyphoenix,It is kinda cozy
13-06-2020T19:07:55,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,Erilas is a pretty doggo
13-06-2020T19:07:55,ProsePro7,Shes got a lovely bunch of watermelons deedly dee there they are a standing in a row big ones big ones some as big as your head

13-06-2020T19:07:58,Katfeathers,Then there's that entire vilage

13-06-2020T19:08:18,TeapotOfDoom,I've got a lovely bunch of Dragonballs~
13-06-2020T19:08:21,ThingsAreMoving,Mike x Rain is something I haven't even considered tbh
13-06-2020T19:08:28,Roughlandin,They're both too nice
13-06-2020T19:08:34,ProsePro7,Everyone wants a piece of that Mike ass
13-06-2020T19:08:36,unsteddyphoenix,"give em a toss, a planet across~"
13-06-2020T19:08:44,ThingsAreMoving,"Sounds... out of sync, somehow"
13-06-2020T19:08:45,TeapotOfDoom,that's how Vegeta wins!
13-06-2020T19:08:57,Roughlandin,Their personalities are too similar IMO
13-06-2020T19:09:02,unsteddyphoenix,aand suddenly I wanna rewatch that whole series
13-06-2020T19:09:09,TeapotOfDoom,Dewit
13-06-2020T19:09:19,ProsePro7,Yeah Patreon is blocking this one...just how I like it
13-06-2020T19:09:26,unsteddyphoenix,Thats true. Raine needs someone less nice and more assertive
13-06-2020T19:09:30,Roughlandin,Too bob for Patreon
13-06-2020T19:09:39,TeapotOfDoom,Gohan means food in japanese btw
13-06-2020T19:09:41,unsteddyphoenix,Someone that will accept her secret lewd fanfiction side

13-06-2020T19:09:52,Brocade,"ooooh, what nice tits Erilas has :O"
13-06-2020T19:09:54,TeapotOfDoom,so goku basically named his son food

13-06-2020T19:10:12,ProsePro7,chichi means boobs
13-06-2020T19:10:14,TeapotOfDoom,as well yes

13-06-2020T19:10:22,ShamusTheFox,There are a lot of in jokes in the dragon ball series.
13-06-2020T19:10:32,Ordithus,Already know Kat likes her stories... and Nora
13-06-2020T19:10:37,TeapotOfDoom,Asagohan means breakfast for example

13-06-2020T19:10:38,AspiringNoodle,Man... Erilas has ALL the pillows...
13-06-2020T19:10:41,Brocade,"gohan can mean ""rice"" or ""meal"", but it could be a homophone"
13-06-2020T19:10:55,Roughlandin,Raine x Kat is is an idea...
13-06-2020T19:11:01,ProsePro7,I think the tail up is catching mikes attention more
13-06-2020T19:11:04,Ordithus,Erilas is quite pretty <3
13-06-2020T19:11:05,ThingsAreMoving,"What's unnerving about Dragonball is that in original DB the world was populated with anthros, and in DBZ they're gone"
13-06-2020T19:11:22,TeapotOfDoom,not really
13-06-2020T19:11:23,Roughlandin,Isn't there still that one dog mayor guy?
