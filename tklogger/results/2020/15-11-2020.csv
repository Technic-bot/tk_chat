15-11-2020T00:00:57,steelabjur,"My computer itself was in one piece, but it was sitting on the kitchen table, the monitors on the couch, the mouse & keyboard by the TV, etc. while I built the new desk to put them on."

15-11-2020T00:03:28,steelabjur,Torture the Mike instead!
15-11-2020T00:03:30,Roughlandin,Sage probably kept him up doing horrible things to his demigod of a D&D character
15-11-2020T00:03:39,SpazztasticKiwi,how literate is she
15-11-2020T00:03:45,Roughlandin,Apparently they're like level 37
15-11-2020T00:04:19,Ordithus,"no, like 17. but similar to 27 or 28 in actual power, I think is what Sage said"
15-11-2020T00:04:28,Roughlandin,"I'd imagine a tavern owner's daughter would learn to read well, Kiwi"
15-11-2020T00:04:31,steelabjur,"Probably fairly. She grew up free among Humans, after all."
15-11-2020T00:04:34,Ordithus,the standard rules only go to 20 for players
15-11-2020T00:04:39,Roughlandin,Gotta know how to now get scammed
15-11-2020T00:04:46,Roughlandin,not
15-11-2020T00:05:01,Roughlandin,Dang Ord. That's what I call power creep
15-11-2020T00:05:18,Roughlandin,Guess that's what happens to all long campaigns
15-11-2020T00:05:29,steelabjur,And the average Mekkan peasant seems literate enough.
15-11-2020T00:05:46,Roughlandin,"Nat: ""...Well I cain't read!"""
15-11-2020T00:05:53,KeefMcDerpface,hehe

15-11-2020T00:06:33,Roughlandin,lol That he is
15-11-2020T00:06:33,SpazztasticKiwi,I wonder because I had the brief idea of her writing a letter to santa

15-11-2020T00:12:50,Roughlandin,The sketch had everything I love
15-11-2020T00:13:06,Dadrobit,I wonder how long she's gonna keep attention? Like how Lilith was a thing for a while. And the Keidran daughter.
15-11-2020T00:13:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Adria reads over Maeve’s little wish list before “mailing” it to santa for her& sees “deer satan...”
15-11-2020T00:13:30,KeefMcDerpface,"Don't forget Evals' sister, too."

15-11-2020T00:14:01,Roughlandin,Don't call it a comeback
15-11-2020T00:14:11,SpazztasticKiwi,she went to volunteer at that resort
15-11-2020T00:14:19,Roughlandin,Also Daniels sketch series ended
15-11-2020T00:14:32,Roughlandin,Tom was pretty adamant that last sketch was the end of his plot
15-11-2020T00:15:00,Roughlandin,The Tiger explorers also had a pretty definitive ending
15-11-2020T00:15:05,Roughlandin,What with the weddin
15-11-2020T00:15:33,Roughlandin,Though there was some hint that one of them wasn't strictly on the up-an-up
15-11-2020T00:15:58,Ordithus,it was nice to see daniels and therie again <3
15-11-2020T00:16:24,SpazztasticKiwi,boy might be taken but he’s Fine
15-11-2020T00:16:44,Roughlandin,Yeah. Same with explorer girl and hunky snep. Also what i'm assuming was bearded explorer and his tiger hubby
15-11-2020T00:17:07,Dadrobit,I wonder who the Basitin lady was with on the couple's retreat?
15-11-2020T00:17:19,Roughlandin,I just assumed she worked there
15-11-2020T00:17:26,SpazztasticKiwi,one moment while I put more food out for Sir Starving to Death Despite the Fact I’ve Had Multiple Trips to my Food Bowl Already
15-11-2020T00:17:37,Roughlandin,"""MAOW!'"
15-11-2020T00:17:47,Roughlandin,*Feed me I'm starving!
15-11-2020T00:18:03,Ordithus,Lies
15-11-2020T00:18:21,Roughlandin,That's their secret. Cats are always starving
15-11-2020T00:18:32,Roughlandin,And your food is always better
15-11-2020T00:18:49,KeefMcDerpface,Uh... Isn't that dogs...?
15-11-2020T00:18:56,Roughlandin,Cats too
15-11-2020T00:19:00,Roughlandin,Least my cat
15-11-2020T00:19:10,KeefMcDerpface,Oh. Didn't know that.
15-11-2020T00:19:10,SpazztasticKiwi,"his food has been out all day, barely even a dent in the kibble mind you"
15-11-2020T00:19:18,Roughlandin,My cat is to pizza what Garfield is to lasagna
15-11-2020T00:19:22,SpazztasticKiwi,plus he’s had treats and snacks  today
15-11-2020T00:19:30,TheSexyBeast,Chonky cats?
15-11-2020T00:19:44,Roughlandin,"Not really, surprisingly"
15-11-2020T00:19:45,Dadrobit,Oreo is only a little picky. I had to find a brand and flavor that he enjoyed before he would eat regularly.
15-11-2020T00:20:03,SpazztasticKiwi,but he’s now climbing all over me for a canned food like he’ll pull an Infinity War moment at anytime
15-11-2020T00:20:08,Roughlandin,Stormie eats anything. Even stuff that isn't edible. It's a problem...
15-11-2020T00:20:25,Ordithus,"depends on the cat. my mom's cat, mocha, is not interested in hooman foods"
15-11-2020T00:20:28,Ordithus,except butter
15-11-2020T00:20:37,Roughlandin,Who DOESN'T love butter
15-11-2020T00:20:42,Sesarag,truee
15-11-2020T00:20:46,SpazztasticKiwi,he should be big as a house with his appetite
15-11-2020T00:20:49,Roughlandin,I'm from Kentucky. Butter is part of my religion
15-11-2020T00:21:00,Sesarag,unless if ur lactose intolerant
15-11-2020T00:21:09,Roughlandin,Still worth it
15-11-2020T00:21:14,Sesarag,Worth the shot
15-11-2020T00:21:23,Roughlandin,Tis
15-11-2020T00:21:24,Ordithus,I am. Butter is usually not consumed in enough quantity to be a problem
15-11-2020T00:21:28,Ordithus,Same with most cheese
15-11-2020T00:21:28,Roughlandin,Same ord
15-11-2020T00:21:36,Roughlandin,Usually only ice cream gets me
15-11-2020T00:21:43,Roughlandin,Or a big glass of milk
15-11-2020T00:21:50,TheSexyBeast,"""Alexa, add butter to the shopping list."""
15-11-2020T00:21:50,Sesarag,Oh
15-11-2020T00:21:53,Ordithus,Yeah I have not had ice cream since college

15-11-2020T00:24:07,Ordithus,sunday sketch stream chat can be a lot
15-11-2020T00:24:10,Dadrobit,That's the level of wealth I want for my life. That level where I can just occasionally buy fancy tasty cheese without thinking about the price at all.
15-11-2020T00:24:11,Roughlandin,It can
15-11-2020T00:24:19,Dadrobit,Also season ticket to the Diamondback.

15-11-2020T00:24:55,KeefMcDerpface,Just don't pay attention to YT chat

15-11-2020T00:25:16,johnnytho,i thought it was 100k
15-11-2020T00:25:17,Ordithus,Yep
15-11-2020T00:25:19,johnnytho,a million geez
15-11-2020T00:25:25,Roughlandin,Yeah it was an experimental channel
15-11-2020T00:25:29,SpazztasticKiwi,and crankgameplays
15-11-2020T00:25:36,Roughlandin,They deleted it on Friday night
15-11-2020T00:25:40,Ordithus,They said there was over 100k waiting for it to start
15-11-2020T00:26:00,Roughlandin,I thought they were expecting 100k and it was actually like 500k queued
15-11-2020T00:26:17,SpazztasticKiwi,that was one of those full work days for me
15-11-2020T00:26:18,Dadrobit,"I mean no offense, cuz honestly I watch variety channel things from time to time myself, but I honestly can't see the appeal to dedicating yourself to JUST being variety."
15-11-2020T00:26:19,Roughlandin,I don't think it dipped under 500k all night
15-11-2020T00:26:27,SpazztasticKiwi,I was too otherwise occupied to worry about them
15-11-2020T00:26:35,Roughlandin,"They had a theme, Dad. It was cool"

15-11-2020T00:27:01,Roughlandin,That's life right?
15-11-2020T00:27:08,Dadrobit,I literally never watched a single video of them tbh...
15-11-2020T00:27:12,Roughlandin,"A bunch of crazy stuff that makes no sense, then you're gone..."
15-11-2020T00:27:14,Ordithus,It was a ride. I watched quite a few
15-11-2020T00:27:15,SpazztasticKiwi,“descending into madness over a full year”
15-11-2020T00:27:28,Roughlandin,Mark is a sweetie
15-11-2020T00:27:29,NinoGD,I watched all of them on the last week
15-11-2020T00:27:36,Roughlandin,The whole Fischbach family is lovely
15-11-2020T00:27:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Mark broke his nose
15-11-2020T00:27:45,SpazztasticKiwi,twice
15-11-2020T00:27:47,Roughlandin,Specially Momma Fischbach
15-11-2020T00:28:08,SpazztasticKiwi,their mother showed up something like 3 times or so
15-11-2020T00:28:12,NinoGD,Yeah
15-11-2020T00:28:14,Roughlandin,"...Whom I have no heard say the words, ""It's like passing a watermellon through your pee hole."""
15-11-2020T00:28:19,Roughlandin,now
15-11-2020T00:28:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Seán was in one video - he was the first guest
15-11-2020T00:28:28,Ordithus,:cw0lfmare-EmberHide:
15-11-2020T00:28:40,Roughlandin,Blame Tom's mom!
15-11-2020T00:28:44,Roughlandin,SHE SAID IT!
15-11-2020T00:28:55,Dadrobit,"For me, I like watching specialists. Top tier examples of things, or expert analysis of those things. I like seeing the minutiae of what makes an expert versus an adept ya know?"
15-11-2020T00:28:59,KeefMcDerpface,That's a saying and a half.
15-11-2020T00:29:11,Roughlandin,Mark is an expert of chaos
15-11-2020T00:29:23,Roughlandin,They made an expert breakfast
15-11-2020T00:29:24,NinoGD,He crashed his lawn mower
15-11-2020T00:29:34,Dadrobit,"Hence, I watch Tom draw, cuz he's carzy good at this shit."
15-11-2020T00:29:39,Dadrobit,crazy*
15-11-2020T00:29:43,SpazztasticKiwi,"“apples are oranges natural predators” -Markiplier, 2020"
15-11-2020T00:29:56,Roughlandin,Mark's crazy good too. All the Fischbach's are talented in their own way
15-11-2020T00:30:13,Ordithus,No you're talented
15-11-2020T00:30:18,Roughlandin,Aww
15-11-2020T00:30:23,Roughlandin,Thanks Ord
15-11-2020T00:30:26,Roughlandin,Right back atcha
15-11-2020T00:30:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Ethan said “(to Mark) you are the smartest and stupidest person I know”
15-11-2020T00:30:43,Roughlandin,And Ethan could hardly speak English. so
15-11-2020T00:30:46,SpazztasticKiwi,sums it up pretty well
15-11-2020T00:30:53,Dadrobit,Mark is a crazy good entertainer within his niche. For sure! Just that that niche of entertainment doesn't hold me for very long even with Mark's commentary.
15-11-2020T00:31:06,Roughlandin,Ethan is a muffin and I love him
15-11-2020T00:31:07,Ordithus,Nothing wrong with that
15-11-2020T00:31:21,Roughlandin,"Not everything works for everybody, Dad"
15-11-2020T00:31:40,Roughlandin,Like Mark said. Wherever you were when it ended. It was YOUR year
15-11-2020T00:31:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Mark is legit chaos
15-11-2020T00:31:58,Roughlandin,That's what I liked about the channel
15-11-2020T00:32:17,Roughlandin,"It was a reminder that even with all the crazy stuff that's happened this year, life still goes on"
15-11-2020T00:32:24,SpazztasticKiwi,sometimes he works for me - other times it’s “thats enough of him for the day”
15-11-2020T00:32:58,Roughlandin,Mark and Tom's humor is me and my brother. I get them SO well
15-11-2020T00:33:31,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t have a brother
15-11-2020T00:33:39,SpazztasticKiwi,not biologically
15-11-2020T00:33:39,Roughlandin,You got me!
15-11-2020T00:33:46,Roughlandin,Oh yeah I guess
15-11-2020T00:34:05,Ordithus,"My brother is like my identical twin, born 7 years earlier"
15-11-2020T00:34:12,NinoGD,I have a brother. We kind of get along
15-11-2020T00:34:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Q and I don’t share blood but we more or less grew up together
15-11-2020T00:34:16,Roughlandin,"Same but two years, Ord"
15-11-2020T00:34:25,Roughlandin,Everyone mistook us for twins growing up
15-11-2020T00:34:27,johnnytho,I remember I threw a chair at my brother once
15-11-2020T00:34:36,SpazztasticKiwi,that sounds reasonable
15-11-2020T00:34:38,Roughlandin,My brother stabbed me with a pencil
15-11-2020T00:34:42,Roughlandin,We love each other
15-11-2020T00:34:44,TheSexyBeast,"Going to head back to sleep, y'all have a good one. Thank Tom for the stream for me."
15-11-2020T00:34:48,SpazztasticKiwi,perfectly normal
15-11-2020T00:34:49,Ordithus,night sexy
15-11-2020T00:34:49,Roughlandin,Night Beast!
15-11-2020T00:34:51,johnnytho,I love my brother
15-11-2020T00:34:53,Dadrobit,"I have 3 brothers, the closest one to me is actually my step-brother lol."
15-11-2020T00:34:57,NinoGD,My brother run me over with a wheel chair
15-11-2020T00:34:59,KeefMcDerpface,night Beast
15-11-2020T00:35:02,Dadrobit,o/ Beast
15-11-2020T00:35:05,TheSexyBeast,Nites.
15-11-2020T00:35:07,NinoGD,Night beast
15-11-2020T00:35:20,Ordithus,"also have a sister, she's the middle child."
15-11-2020T00:35:27,SpazztasticKiwi,I never knew Mark had a brother until 2016/17
15-11-2020T00:35:45,Roughlandin,I have an older sister who was basically my mom growing up because my mother is a full time teacher
15-11-2020T00:36:18,Roughlandin,She got the practice she needed. Now she has twins and a second boy
15-11-2020T00:36:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Ethan’s got an older brother too but there might be another based on a comment on one of his ig posts
15-11-2020T00:36:31,Roughlandin,And they're all 13 months apart
15-11-2020T00:36:35,johnnytho,:)
15-11-2020T00:36:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Seán definitely has two older brothers and sisters
15-11-2020T00:37:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I relate to him more than Mark or Eef
15-11-2020T00:37:13,Roughlandin,Brothers refine your sense of humor... and your ability to take punishment
15-11-2020T00:37:15,Ordithus,He's got more snark
15-11-2020T00:37:35,Roughlandin,Sean is like a muffin that will bite you if you don't treat it right
15-11-2020T00:37:54,Roughlandin,"Treat the muffin right, yo"
15-11-2020T00:38:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Seán is a bean
15-11-2020T00:38:11,SpazztasticKiwi,a coffee bean
15-11-2020T00:38:11,Roughlandin,Ethan is a soff muffin. I wanna protec him
15-11-2020T00:38:28,Roughlandin,Mark is chaos incarnate and I love it
15-11-2020T00:38:38,SpazztasticKiwi,but he’s got alot going on that I understand
15-11-2020T00:38:51,Roughlandin,And then there's Tom
15-11-2020T00:38:58,Roughlandin,The G O D
15-11-2020T00:39:12,SpazztasticKiwi,he’s got a at odds family with alcohol and petty problems too
15-11-2020T00:39:23,Roughlandin,Sean?
15-11-2020T00:39:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"he’s said he’s only really close to his oldest brother, the second of the family"
15-11-2020T00:39:40,Roughlandin,Aww poor guy
15-11-2020T00:39:41,SpazztasticKiwi,yea
15-11-2020T00:39:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Sean’s brother is an author you know
15-11-2020T00:40:00,Roughlandin,Oh cool
15-11-2020T00:40:06,SpazztasticKiwi,he almost committed suicide years ago
15-11-2020T00:40:11,Roughlandin,Oh NOT cool
15-11-2020T00:40:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Malcolm was a raging alcoholic until his son asked him if he was going to die
15-11-2020T00:40:48,Dadrobit,"lol, Spazz. I remember when Mark first started his YouTube career he came onto Tom's forum talking about starting his career and how he wanted to be like Freddie Wong one day."
15-11-2020T00:41:11,Roughlandin,Mark used to be on Tom's forum? That's adorable!
15-11-2020T00:41:14,Dadrobit,T'was a long ass time ago.
15-11-2020T00:41:26,Roughlandin,Well yeah. Back when Tom had a forum
15-11-2020T00:41:27,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I could probably dredge it up."
15-11-2020T00:41:30,SpazztasticKiwi,and he got close enough to it that he had a rope hanging from a tree when something told him not to
15-11-2020T00:41:36,Roughlandin,Yeesh
15-11-2020T00:41:43,Ordithus,Wow
15-11-2020T00:41:57,Roughlandin,Happens to the best of us. I've been down some dark roads myself
15-11-2020T00:41:58,Ordithus,Good that he made it
15-11-2020T00:42:00,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s all in his book
15-11-2020T00:42:15,Ordithus,"The tk forum is still a thing, rough"
15-11-2020T00:42:27,SpazztasticKiwi,"he’s recovered, and thanks his finding religion and friendships"
15-11-2020T00:42:28,Roughlandin,...I knew this
15-11-2020T00:42:36,SpazztasticKiwi,but yeah
15-11-2020T00:42:48,SpazztasticKiwi,his family never knew he was suicidal
15-11-2020T00:42:51,Roughlandin,You build a support structure. That's how you get through
15-11-2020T00:43:09,Roughlandin,I've got a lovely family and irl friends. Plus you folks!
15-11-2020T00:43:29,SpazztasticKiwi,I remember asking Seán about Malcolm when I saw him at PAX East in 2018
15-11-2020T00:43:40,Roughlandin,But yeah. I've had some dark times too. We all do
15-11-2020T00:43:59,Roughlandin,Summer before junior year of highschool and Freshman year of college
15-11-2020T00:44:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I gave him something to get to him since Mal doesn’t travel to the US
15-11-2020T00:44:28,Roughlandin,Aw nice
15-11-2020T00:45:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I can feel that struggle with alcoholism and losing family
15-11-2020T00:45:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Malcolm’s still here
15-11-2020T00:45:42,Roughlandin,I'm really lucky that substance abuse has never been a thing in my family
15-11-2020T00:45:48,Dadrobit,Can confirm same. Broke my back in HS and it ended my military career before it even really started. USAF dropped talks immediately and not a single recruiter would even look at me after that. Killed a childhood dream something fierce. Hurts the soul.
15-11-2020T00:45:50,Roughlandin,Well... one uncle
15-11-2020T00:46:03,Roughlandin,I feel that dad
15-11-2020T00:46:05,SpazztasticKiwi,my dad had a problem with it
15-11-2020T00:46:15,Roughlandin,I had a mental breakdown and got kicked out of pharmacy school
15-11-2020T00:46:34,SpazztasticKiwi,most of the men in my dad’s side had a problem with alcohol
15-11-2020T00:46:34,Roughlandin,It's weird to have your life so built around one thing and then... not have that thing anymore
15-11-2020T00:46:47,Roughlandin,It took me a long time to get past that
15-11-2020T00:47:19,Roughlandin,But you're MORE than that one thing
15-11-2020T00:47:34,Roughlandin,It took me a long time to realize that
15-11-2020T00:47:57,Dadrobit,Found it! https://www.twokinds.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=697311#p697311
15-11-2020T00:48:03,SpazztasticKiwi,https://www.amazon.com/Second-Lap-Going-Distance-Race-ebook/dp/B00U7MLS2K/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=the+second+lap&qid=1605505632&sr=8-1
15-11-2020T00:48:25,Roughlandin,Awww! Babby Mark!
15-11-2020T00:48:36,Roughlandin,"And thanks for the link, Spazz"
15-11-2020T00:48:37,SpazztasticKiwi,that’s his book - I have it and thought about getting it signed but it’s not likely
15-11-2020T00:48:42,Roughlandin,I'll have to check it out
15-11-2020T00:49:06,Roughlandin,Guilty admission time. For a long time I thought Tom was the younger brother...
15-11-2020T00:49:12,SpazztasticKiwi,hopefully you won’t get lost but there’s 7 total in his immediate family
15-11-2020T00:49:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"their parents, which by the way Seán and Mal’s father is 40 years older than Seán"
15-11-2020T00:49:33,Roughlandin,He even kinda looks like sean
15-11-2020T00:49:37,Sesarag,wew that's from 2012
15-11-2020T00:49:57,SpazztasticKiwi,and their father was put into a home about a year ago
15-11-2020T00:50:03,Roughlandin,Oof
15-11-2020T00:50:08,Roughlandin,I know what that's like
15-11-2020T00:50:14,SpazztasticKiwi,he’s got dementia or the signs of it
15-11-2020T00:50:28,Roughlandin,We had to do that for my father's brother
15-11-2020T00:50:39,Roughlandin,He had a series of strokes
15-11-2020T00:51:06,Roughlandin,His funeral was the week before quarantine. The next week my family was supposed to go on a vacation
15-11-2020T00:51:09,Roughlandin,...So that was out
15-11-2020T00:51:21,KeefMcDerpface,ouch
15-11-2020T00:51:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"the oldest is Allison I think, then there’s Malcolm, Susan, Simon, & Seán is the baby"
15-11-2020T00:51:46,Roughlandin,And the whole year before that my dad was diagnosed with cancer and had to have a stim cell transplant
15-11-2020T00:52:00,Roughlandin,That vacation was gonna be his big reward for remission
15-11-2020T00:52:07,Roughlandin,So year... 2020 sucks
15-11-2020T00:52:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Seán once shared his grandma’s story
15-11-2020T00:52:23,Ordithus,"sorry, rough"
15-11-2020T00:52:30,Roughlandin,Thanks Ord
15-11-2020T00:52:36,SpazztasticKiwi,during her last moments she was in the hospital and asked “where’s Seán” & he was standing right there
15-11-2020T00:52:40,SpazztasticKiwi,in front of her
15-11-2020T00:52:40,Roughlandin,Like I said. You live with what life gives you
15-11-2020T00:52:51,Roughlandin,Ouch Kiwi
15-11-2020T00:52:59,Ordithus,man that's sad
15-11-2020T00:53:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I think he said she had cancer and dementia
15-11-2020T00:53:40,SpazztasticKiwi,that video hurt me because he burst into tears and then I burst into tears because he burst into tears
15-11-2020T00:53:45,Roughlandin,Sucks. But everybody has to deal with stuff like that
15-11-2020T00:53:47,Dadrobit,:/ Had a similar situation with my gradfather in his last days with brain cancer. He didn't know my name anymore and was calling me by my brother's name. Fukkin hurt to see him like that. He was an absolutely brilliant man before it all...
15-11-2020T00:54:11,Roughlandin,My uncle was bad at the end. He was in a coma for weeks
15-11-2020T00:54:26,Roughlandin,Blargh
15-11-2020T00:54:42,Ordithus,I have a cousin suffering dementia. I have not seen her in many years... life has been hard on her and hers
15-11-2020T00:54:46,Roughlandin,"But like I said. You take your lumps, you deal your cards and you keep moving"
15-11-2020T00:55:00,Roughlandin,THAT'S what I appreciated about Unus Annus
15-11-2020T00:55:36,Roughlandin,Because it was about impermanence and processing grief
15-11-2020T00:55:44,SpazztasticKiwi,"as far as I’ve learned, Seán isn’t close to his family except for Malcolm"
15-11-2020T00:55:56,Roughlandin,...And people making breakfast with sex toys
15-11-2020T00:56:13,SpazztasticKiwi,and the only thing he’s said about it hints that there’s some underhanded members in his family
15-11-2020T00:56:22,Roughlandin,Every family has some
15-11-2020T00:56:49,Roughlandin,Family is what you make it though
15-11-2020T00:56:56,SpazztasticKiwi,he’s shared they’re not an “I love you” family and mines honestly the same
15-11-2020T00:57:07,Roughlandin,My best irl friend has a bastard of a biological father
15-11-2020T00:57:15,Roughlandin,He messed up her head for YEARS
15-11-2020T00:57:20,SpazztasticKiwi,but there’s obviously family issues he’s grown up with
15-11-2020T00:57:59,Roughlandin,"Well Sean seems like he has a great group of friends and a wonderful community. Like I said, family isn't strictly blood"
15-11-2020T00:58:09,Roughlandin,The family you BUILD is just as important
15-11-2020T00:58:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Seán came close to losing Mal to alcohol and technically that’s how I lost my dad but the distant family is a mood
15-11-2020T00:59:14,AspiringNoodle,*sigh*
15-11-2020T00:59:19,Roughlandin,I get it. Sometimes I feel bad for even taking a single drink because some people I know have BAD family experiences with alcohol
15-11-2020T00:59:31,AspiringNoodle,"I lost one grandmother to Alzheimer's / Dementia, and I'm losing another to the exact same thing."
15-11-2020T00:59:39,Roughlandin,Yeesh. 2020 SUCKS
15-11-2020T00:59:42,Roughlandin,Sorry Noodle
15-11-2020T00:59:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"while I like Mark and Ethan, love them to death, they have their fish moments like anyone else where they’ll say how close they are to their older brothers or fathers"
15-11-2020T00:59:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Ethan is extremely close to his dad
15-11-2020T01:00:12,Roughlandin,"Mark and Tom's dad has passed, right?"
15-11-2020T01:00:14,AspiringNoodle,"It's fine, my one grandmother was in a home for a few years, we lost her towards the start of the pandemic"
15-11-2020T01:00:15,SpazztasticKiwi,gush moments
15-11-2020T01:00:21,SpazztasticKiwi,yeah he passed
15-11-2020T01:00:22,Ordithus,yes
15-11-2020T01:00:48,Roughlandin,I remember when he saw the easter egg of his dad in Doom Eternal and he got kinda choked up

15-11-2020T01:01:49,Roughlandin,That took me a long time to process
15-11-2020T01:01:54,Roughlandin,It still is
15-11-2020T01:02:00,AspiringNoodle,Terminal illnesses suck. Plain and simple.
15-11-2020T01:02:05,Roughlandin,Agreed

15-11-2020T01:03:46,AspiringNoodle,"On top of that, she's extremely stubborn.  That's just her personality.  But it's problematic when she has no short-term memory and makes it impossible to help"
15-11-2020T01:04:02,SpazztasticKiwi,and daddio was a whole can of worms

15-11-2020T01:08:06,Roughlandin,...Mark is a biomedical engineer???
15-11-2020T01:08:09,Roughlandin,WHAT?
15-11-2020T01:08:18,Ordithus,"no, he dropped out"
15-11-2020T01:08:27,Roughlandin,Oh well I can identify with that

15-11-2020T01:09:00,Roughlandin,He coulda been a contender!
15-11-2020T01:09:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Mark was 2 months from graduating when he dropped it for yt
15-11-2020T01:09:26,Ordithus,That close? wow.
15-11-2020T01:09:34,Ordithus,He really did hate it
15-11-2020T01:09:36,SpazztasticKiwi,that’s what he’s said
15-11-2020T01:09:43,Roughlandin,I was about to start my senior residency. I can relate

15-11-2020T01:12:52,Dadrobit,"Was just chatting with one of my old professors, Dr. Kevin actually. Astronomy. We were chatting about lockdown reducing smog emissions and making for clearer night skies."
15-11-2020T01:13:09,Roughlandin,"Hey. There's one plus about this year, Dad"
15-11-2020T01:13:11,Dadrobit,"Went outside and holy crap, he's so right."
15-11-2020T01:13:16,AspiringNoodle,"Dadro, quickly"
15-11-2020T01:13:24,Roughlandin,...You know I HAVE been seeing more stars recently
15-11-2020T01:13:26,Roughlandin,weird
15-11-2020T01:13:45,AspiringNoodle,What is a star's stage of life that immediately predates its death by supernova?
15-11-2020T01:14:10,Roughlandin,Uh... midlife crisis?
15-11-2020T01:14:10,Dadrobit,"It's actually crazy clear out right now. Constellations are crazy visible, and outstanding stars are totally clear to the naked eye throught the sky."
15-11-2020T01:14:19,Ordithus,"white dwarf, thank you wiki"
15-11-2020T01:14:24,Ordithus,nice dadro
15-11-2020T01:14:28,Dadrobit,Just before supernova is core collapse.
15-11-2020T01:14:28,Ordithus,I haz clouds
15-11-2020T01:14:44,SpazztasticKiwi,all I see is the roof
15-11-2020T01:14:56,Roughlandin,Most stars I've ever seen was when I took a trip to Key Largo in the 8th grade
15-11-2020T01:14:59,Roughlandin,It was NUTS
15-11-2020T01:15:13,Ordithus,eastern tip of michigan's up for me
15-11-2020T01:15:16,Roughlandin,That was the best 8th Grade trip ever
15-11-2020T01:15:26,AspiringNoodle,"ord, can you message me your source?"
15-11-2020T01:15:26,Ordithus,"milky way, clearly visible with the naked eye"
15-11-2020T01:15:29,Roughlandin,The class raised money for it al year
15-11-2020T01:15:31,AspiringNoodle,I could've SWORN it's red giant...
15-11-2020T01:15:40,Ordithus,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova
15-11-2020T01:15:42,Dadrobit,Summer here in the Moggillon Rim is insane. Perfectly visible Milky Way band.
15-11-2020T01:15:46,Roughlandin,Doesn't it depend on the star?
15-11-2020T01:16:17,Roughlandin,...It's been a while since I took astronomy
15-11-2020T01:16:23,AspiringNoodle,My understanding that red giants happen when stars run out of hydrogen and start fusing the helium
15-11-2020T01:16:31,AspiringNoodle,that's why they bloat in size
15-11-2020T01:16:34,Ordithus,Different stars follow different paths
15-11-2020T01:16:39,Roughlandin,Smallest college class I ever took. Only 5 students
15-11-2020T01:16:45,Ordithus,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_evolution
15-11-2020T01:16:54,AspiringNoodle,"After that runs out, the stars are either so small that the red giant phase pushes the remaining fuel outwards"
15-11-2020T01:16:58,Roughlandin,Big difference from my freshman econ class in a 500 person lecture hall
15-11-2020T01:17:00,AspiringNoodle,Or big enough to pull them inwards
15-11-2020T01:17:26,AspiringNoodle,"If they're big enough to recollect the fuel, but not large enough to go black hole, nuclear fusion is reignited with even heavier elements and it creates a supernova"
15-11-2020T01:17:31,Dadrobit,"Yeah, immediately before Supernova explosion is the core collapse. It's the point where gravity wins and then matter bounces off of itself once it collapses completely and explodes outwards."
15-11-2020T01:17:48,Roughlandin,I always thought stars were the spirits of the Kings sent to guide us...
15-11-2020T01:18:00,AspiringNoodle,And White Dwarf is literally one of the EoL stages for stars
15-11-2020T01:18:04,AspiringNoodle,It's where only the core remains
15-11-2020T01:18:21,Roughlandin,Oh no. I'M a white dward irl!!!
15-11-2020T01:18:28,Roughlandin,dwarf
15-11-2020T01:18:32,Roughlandin,Bears can't type
15-11-2020T01:19:08,Roughlandin,...I just remembered I still had the tab to Long Snoot Laura up...
15-11-2020T01:19:11,Roughlandin,Big mistake
15-11-2020T01:19:15,Roughlandin,Never again
15-11-2020T01:19:38,AspiringNoodle,Jackbox 2's Trivia Murder Party asks about the stage a star takes immediately before going supernova
15-11-2020T01:19:47,AspiringNoodle,"And everyone got it wrong because the game said ""White Dwarf"""
15-11-2020T01:20:00,Roughlandin,A trivia game with WRONG trivia?
15-11-2020T01:20:03,Roughlandin,GASP!
15-11-2020T01:20:25,Dadrobit,"Yeah, that's pretty unacceptable, not gonna lie."
15-11-2020T01:20:31,AspiringNoodle,"It's not entirely wrong, apparently."
15-11-2020T01:20:51,AspiringNoodle,Some White Dwarves can be sister stars and leech material off their twin
15-11-2020T01:20:53,Dadrobit,The White Dwarf is what remains AFTER the Supernova explosion.
15-11-2020T01:21:04,Roughlandin,The worst kinds of answers are the vague ones and the other ones with the stuff
15-11-2020T01:21:14,AspiringNoodle,"And when they leech too much, it triggers stuff and goes boom.  But yeah... I just wanted to make sure I wasn't crazy"
15-11-2020T01:21:30,Dadrobit,Then two White Dwarfs can merge causing a secondary Supernova leading either to a Neutron Star or a Black Hole.
15-11-2020T01:21:33,Roughlandin,"I don't think you're crazy, noodle. You're just... aspiring"
15-11-2020T01:21:46,Ordithus,well I think you're crazy
15-11-2020T01:22:02,Roughlandin,Aww

15-11-2020T01:22:38,Roughlandin,Nibbs has a room with a view!

15-11-2020T22:26:16,CrRAR,I’d imagine attempts at gently picking him up only enhances grip.
15-11-2020T22:26:22,CrRAR,“no”
15-11-2020T22:26:31,CrRAR,“I CLIMB!”
15-11-2020T22:27:32,SpazztasticKiwi,he’s never tried climbing me at all except jumping on my shoulders or back or laying there
15-11-2020T22:28:07,SpazztasticKiwi,but he does have a thing where he’ll sit at my feet and reach up
15-11-2020T22:29:04,SpazztasticKiwi,he stretches to my hip from bottom feet to top tootsies
15-11-2020T22:29:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"it’s his way of telling me he wants to be picked up - petted, attention, hugs, whatever"

15-11-2020T22:30:10,CrRAR,Does he have a kitty condo too?
15-11-2020T22:30:57,SpazztasticKiwi,there’s a small scratching post but a cat tree is space challenged at the moment
15-11-2020T22:31:54,SpazztasticKiwi,I have a feeling if I get a cat tree it can’t be taller than me because there’s a healthy chance he won’t want to get down
15-11-2020T22:34:24,CrRAR,Those cat shelve walls you see are pretty cool
