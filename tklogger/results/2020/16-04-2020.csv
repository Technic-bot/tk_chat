16-04-2020T17:50:14,SpazztasticKiwi,"but yeah, since the decree for governors to decide what and when to open back up, Alabama is back in business"
16-04-2020T17:50:42,CrRAR,"Great, I guess they‚Äôll see how it goes."
16-04-2020T17:51:08,SpazztasticKiwi,problem is it never hurts the stupid people
16-04-2020T17:51:24,SpazztasticKiwi,they‚Äôre numb from the neck up
16-04-2020T17:51:26,CrRAR,haha
16-04-2020T17:52:04,AspiringNoodle,This whole pandemic has me pissed at people in general
16-04-2020T17:52:06,Ordithus,stay safe spazz
16-04-2020T17:52:10,AspiringNoodle,"How about you, Kiwi?"
16-04-2020T17:52:28,SpazztasticKiwi,*cathartic screaming*
16-04-2020T17:52:38,AspiringNoodle,"Ah, we're in agreement then"
16-04-2020T17:54:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I feel like that man in the video where the girl sings the frozen 2 siren song and he screams it back
16-04-2020T17:56:05,AspiringNoodle,Can't remember if you were here when I said this
16-04-2020T17:56:16,AspiringNoodle,But Wednesday we had more people in the store than usual
16-04-2020T17:56:29,AspiringNoodle,Even more than the last time I worked a Friday
16-04-2020T17:56:43,AspiringNoodle,And what was the hot ticket item? MOTHER. EFFING. LOTTERY.
16-04-2020T17:57:13,AspiringNoodle,"No idea if people were using stimulus money for that, but it's definitely a possibility..."
16-04-2020T17:57:47,SpazztasticKiwi,stores out of tvs phones and generally all electronics
16-04-2020T17:58:20,SpazztasticKiwi,people came in and blew emergency money on goodies
16-04-2020T17:58:53,AspiringNoodle,"See, electronics I can kinda understand"
16-04-2020T17:58:58,SpazztasticKiwi,but those I work with? one put it towards her new house bills & furniture and the other paid her credit
16-04-2020T17:59:14,SpazztasticKiwi,rest is in savings
16-04-2020T17:59:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve yet to get mine
16-04-2020T17:59:30,AspiringNoodle,"If you got laid off and aren't making a lot of money right now, and something broke, you might not be able to replacement"
16-04-2020T17:59:56,SpazztasticKiwi,unemployment is earning more than essentials rn you know that right
16-04-2020T18:00:07,AspiringNoodle,How much is it paying?
16-04-2020T18:00:47,SpazztasticKiwi,depends on the state but here it‚Äôs estimated $600-800 not counting the food stamp boost
16-04-2020T18:03:03,AspiringNoodle,And how often?
16-04-2020T18:04:04,SpazztasticKiwi,tf if I know - as regular as a paycheck
16-04-2020T18:09:13,AspiringNoodle,"Well, if a bunch of my coworkers quit, I'll know why, lol"
16-04-2020T18:10:26,AspiringNoodle,Don't know if I could even qualify for unemployment.  I was part time (generally trying to get 20 - 24 hours per week) before all this hit.  The only thing in my favor is that I can't go full time if I wanted to at my current job.
16-04-2020T18:10:29,AspiringNoodle,"And trust me, I don't, lol."
16-04-2020T18:11:10,ThoseButterflys,Sorry to intrude on your conversation but do you guy/gals know if we are back to the normal scheduled for the TK comic
16-04-2020T18:11:36,ThoseButterflys,just want to be sure
16-04-2020T18:11:42,AspiringNoodle,No idea.  I'm super chill about the update schedule because Tom does a ridiculous amount of work outside the comic.
16-04-2020T18:12:33,ThoseButterflys,yeah wait what else (other than a job) does he do
16-04-2020T18:13:33,ThoseButterflys,does he have other comics he makes
16-04-2020T18:14:17,AspiringNoodle,Doesn't need to.  His Patreon is pretty dang successful
16-04-2020T18:14:46,AspiringNoodle,"And then there's the merch he sells online, his few picarto subs, and any other merch he sells at cons"
16-04-2020T18:15:59,ThoseButterflys,"ok thats actually pretty cool Wish one day we get a stream with all 8,450 followers"
16-04-2020T18:16:07,AspiringNoodle,"Although, I am worried about his Patreon"
16-04-2020T18:16:31,AspiringNoodle,That idiot of a company loves going on a new crusade every other week and banning some group of degenerates or rejects they don't approve of :/
16-04-2020T18:16:52,AspiringNoodle,"Although, apparently Patreon is going broke, lol"
16-04-2020T18:16:58,ThoseButterflys,why I dont have an acount so I dont know much about that
16-04-2020T18:17:22,ThoseButterflys,ooh that isn't good at all
16-04-2020T18:17:51,AspiringNoodle,"Well, the dumbasses did it to themselves"
16-04-2020T18:18:10,ThoseButterflys,how
16-04-2020T18:18:13,AspiringNoodle,They even sent out a rather tone deaf email recently that basically begs creators to come back
16-04-2020T18:18:30,AspiringNoodle,"Well, they started banning people from their platform for their political opinions"
16-04-2020T18:18:57,AspiringNoodle,"These people didn't even violate Patreon's ToS, Patreon simply didn't approve of what they were doing offsite (policing people OFF their platform), and said, ""Yah gone!"""
16-04-2020T18:19:16,AspiringNoodle,That was the FIRST huge blow
16-04-2020T18:19:56,ThoseButterflys,"presses ""F"" to pay respects"
16-04-2020T18:20:10,AspiringNoodle,"Then they started policing adult content, outright banning certain kinds of content.  Meaning people either left the platform for things like Subscribestar, or self-censored their content to stay in Patreon's good graces"
16-04-2020T18:20:50,AspiringNoodle,"There was also a controversy where Subscribestar ""mysteriously"" lost access to their payment processor shortly after this event"
16-04-2020T18:20:53,ThoseButterflys,why Tom doesnt do that
16-04-2020T18:21:07,AspiringNoodle,"(Hmmmm, seems like maybe Patreon pulled some strings in an attempt to get their way)"
16-04-2020T18:21:11,K3IDRAN,Patreon: What you hate democracy you know what *Bans the Innocent* ALL HAIL TRUMP  and thr Sjws
16-04-2020T18:21:30,AspiringNoodle,"And the most RECENT controversy was the banning of ""Japanese style art"""
16-04-2020T18:21:41,ThoseButterflys,WTF
16-04-2020T18:21:56,AspiringNoodle,And since Tom's art is heavily influenced... I'm just wondering if he'll get hit eventually
16-04-2020T18:21:57,K3IDRAN,Dafaq
16-04-2020T18:22:23,ThoseButterflys,its fine if its He........Hentai but why just
16-04-2020T18:22:29,AspiringNoodle,NO
16-04-2020T18:22:34,AspiringNoodle,"NEVER SAY ""IT'S FINE IF"""
16-04-2020T18:22:47,AspiringNoodle,THAT GIVES THEM ALL THE LICENSE TO GO FURTHER AFTER THEY GET RID OF WHAT YOU DON'T CARE FOR
16-04-2020T18:23:04,K3IDRAN,Is the guys over at patreln hit their head or something
16-04-2020T18:23:13,ThoseButterflys,No I mean the getting rid of the H word but the rest why ban
16-04-2020T18:23:31,AspiringNoodle,Dude... hentai is literally just drawn porn...
16-04-2020T18:23:45,K3IDRAN,He hent- *BANBED*
16-04-2020T18:24:34,K3IDRAN,Rip K3idran 2019 - 2020
16-04-2020T18:24:34,ThoseButterflys,"Ooh no he got ""BANBED"""
16-04-2020T18:24:38,AspiringNoodle,"IIRC, their reasoning is that the art style used for basically all anime / manga gives characters a child-like appearance"
16-04-2020T18:24:55,AspiringNoodle,So they're just outright banket banning it.
16-04-2020T18:24:59,AspiringNoodle,blanket*
16-04-2020T18:25:38,AspiringNoodle,"Tom's style is heavily derived from that particular root, so I am worried that some day they might come for him."
16-04-2020T18:25:51,ThoseButterflys,"yeah read int to chinese  culture you used to hit 13 and that was their ""18"" year old permisions"
16-04-2020T18:26:05,AspiringNoodle,"But life lesson, Butterfly"
16-04-2020T18:26:15,K3IDRAN,At least  Dev Isn't doing yhis
16-04-2020T18:26:16,ThoseButterflys,what
16-04-2020T18:26:22,K3IDRAN,This
16-04-2020T18:26:27,AspiringNoodle,"When the powers that be start to ""censor"" something, look into it HEAVILY"
16-04-2020T18:26:49,AspiringNoodle,"NEVER use the basis ""Well, I personally don't agree with it, therefore it's fine"""
16-04-2020T18:26:59,AspiringNoodle,Because that is EXACTLY how the famous poem goes
16-04-2020T18:27:08,K3IDRAN,True
16-04-2020T18:27:23,AspiringNoodle,It starts with them banning something you don't like or are actively against
16-04-2020T18:27:32,AspiringNoodle,Then they ban stuff that you don't care one way or another for
16-04-2020T18:27:48,AspiringNoodle,"And then when they finally start coming for the stuff you DO like, and you're screaming, protesting, and asking for help"
16-04-2020T18:28:09,ThoseButterflys,What in sam fisher fuck are they thinking is going to happen
16-04-2020T18:28:31,AspiringNoodle,"The people you shunned because you neither cared for, or actively disliked the stuff they liked are going to tell you to go eff yourself, because you had your chance when you coulda helped them"
16-04-2020T18:28:57,AspiringNoodle,But you didn't
16-04-2020T18:28:59,AspiringNoodle,So now you're on your own
16-04-2020T18:29:06,K3IDRAN,Imafen Youtube Banning you for uploadkng Halo and yt saying  Ohh your uploading Kids content because Astronauts
16-04-2020T18:29:47,K3IDRAN,my reaction would be ''YT HSLO IS A FUCKING RATED M GAJE!''
16-04-2020T18:30:14,AspiringNoodle,"True tolerance is someone liking something you don't like, but you allowing them to go along with their business"
16-04-2020T18:30:32,ThoseButterflys,So just to clear this up  yu can get banned for foul language but you only by the stream owner or moderator right?
16-04-2020T18:31:00,AspiringNoodle,I'm not sure.  I need to check Phil's rules
16-04-2020T18:31:09,AspiringNoodle,Tom... I don't know if he has rules lying around somewhere
16-04-2020T18:31:27,AspiringNoodle,"I jsut know the big thing with Phil is that if you link something, you need to give a short description before the link, and it needs to be SFW"
16-04-2020T18:31:43,AspiringNoodle,But language?  I'm not sure... I'm personally just trying to swear less.  And these phony swears are sorta helping
16-04-2020T18:32:27,ThoseButterflys,ok  so that is what I was asking you can but cant swear
16-04-2020T18:32:52,AspiringNoodle,"Soooo, yeah.  I'm just trying to get this point across"
16-04-2020T18:33:23,AspiringNoodle,"If an online platform starts banning certain kinds of content or political thought, DO NOT go along with it without a dump-truck sized dose of scrutiny"
16-04-2020T18:33:44,ThoseButterflys,ok thanks I dont have a patreon account so I didnt know anything bad was happening
16-04-2020T18:33:57,AspiringNoodle,Yup.  They had a license to print money
16-04-2020T18:34:13,AspiringNoodle,"But they're blowing it on stupid initiatives / councils, and banning people from their platform left and right, lol"
16-04-2020T18:34:24,K3IDRAN,I miss 2019 Patreon
16-04-2020T18:35:52,ThoseButterflys,I kind of understand but I also want to send the owners a strongly worded email
16-04-2020T18:36:05,ThoseButterflys,just because
16-04-2020T18:36:38,AspiringNoodle,Give it time
16-04-2020T18:37:03,AspiringNoodle,Either Patreon will die because they got a game over on the easiest mode
16-04-2020T18:37:28,AspiringNoodle,"Or they'll turn ship around, and the creators will make it very clear that they can not do it again, or they're gone for good."
16-04-2020T18:37:54,ThoseButterflys,or Someone will slap them with some sense
16-04-2020T18:38:06,AspiringNoodle,We honestly need to kill this business models where these new companies provide some kind of outlet for people to express themselves and monetize their work
16-04-2020T18:38:27,AspiringNoodle,"Only to then turn around and say, ""We don't need you creators anymore"" once they get big enough and start attractive investors and advertisors."
16-04-2020T18:39:03,AspiringNoodle,It's been happening with youtube for the longest time
16-04-2020T18:39:13,AspiringNoodle,"It happened to Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and now Patreon"
16-04-2020T18:39:39,ThoseButterflys,yeah but there the line of ok and not ok is a little more clear
16-04-2020T18:39:52,ThoseButterflys,on youtube
16-04-2020T18:39:52,AspiringNoodle,"Is it really, though?"
16-04-2020T18:40:21,AspiringNoodle,"Youtube has, literally, the most abusable copyright system on the entire internet"
16-04-2020T18:40:52,SpazztasticKiwi,you know there‚Äôs whispers for this right
16-04-2020T18:41:00,ThoseButterflys,yeah I said a little
16-04-2020T18:41:14,ThoseButterflys,yeah why whisper though
16-04-2020T18:41:21,AspiringNoodle,"Kiwi right, really close to strem time"

16-04-2020T19:34:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Sage can tell you more detailed stuff - he‚Äôs usually the one that‚Äôs real good to stay on top of stuff
16-04-2020T19:35:59,SpazztasticKiwi,I know he‚Äôs good to warn people if they‚Äôre doing a no no unless it‚Äôs a instaban thing

16-04-2020T20:12:51,SageSaga,his heart failed and they put a balloon in his heart to keep it pumping - they expected as soon as they removed it though he would die

16-04-2020T20:16:00,SageSaga,well just be aware if i fly off the handle at someone spreading false information about the current going ons and what not it's probably due to a short fuse from dealing with that

16-04-2020T21:00:31,SageSaga,so @TheArringtastic41 why should we not ban you?
16-04-2020T21:00:33,TLDragon,"pssh, minecraft isn't a timesink. Modded minecraft, on the other hand..."
16-04-2020T21:00:46,BlackjackSec99,O.O

16-04-2020T21:01:24,TLDragon,"@BlackjackSec99 yes, yes there are."
16-04-2020T21:01:31,BlackjackSec99,oh... why must you tell me this.....
16-04-2020T21:01:51,BlackjackSec99,Fallout and Skyrim modding are already time consumers.....
16-04-2020T21:02:04,johnnytho,Planning to bring mayhem to the chat Blackjack?
16-04-2020T21:02:19,KeefMcDerpface,Wait until you see the mods for Minecraft.
16-04-2020T21:02:20,unsteddyphoenix,Better not >:(
16-04-2020T21:02:21,TLDragon,do you want (kinda OP) magic stuff? Look for Astral Sorcery. Do you want a full suite of technologies? Thermal Expansion (among others) has you covered. And so on. :)
16-04-2020T21:02:28,Dragusthor,hace tiempo cuando se lanzaron
16-04-2020T21:02:43,BlackjackSec99,and... where do you find these mods?
16-04-2020T21:02:55,TLDragon,and then there are things like the Sky Factory modpack that stacks a whole bunch of them into one kit.
16-04-2020T21:03:05,TLDragon,Twitch has a few modpacks already preconfigured.
16-04-2020T21:03:15,KeefMcDerpface,"Wait, they do?"
16-04-2020T21:03:19,johnnytho,Dragusthor you speak spanish?
16-04-2020T21:03:23,Mihari,"Well hold on, mods only exist for the java version, if you're playing the other version then, not so much."
16-04-2020T21:03:37,BadFoMo,@BlackjackSec99 I have fond memories of CustomNPCs and MineCollanies.
16-04-2020T21:03:40,Dragusthor,I don't understand why they modify them?
16-04-2020T21:03:50,BlackjackSec99,I have the one you get through the Microsoft store on PC
16-04-2020T21:03:57,Mihari,That would not be the Java version
16-04-2020T21:04:02,TLDragon,why modify Minecraft? Mainly to add all kinds of content.
16-04-2020T21:04:02,Grip,Some times it is to make the experience more unique.
16-04-2020T21:04:02,BlackjackSec99,...drat
16-04-2020T21:04:12,BadFoMo,Sorry.
16-04-2020T21:04:19,Dragusthor,johnnytho yes
16-04-2020T21:04:22,SageSaga,mods are more fun
16-04-2020T21:04:42,TLDragon,"Most modpacks do not alter the basic vanilla mechanics, they just add hundreds of hours of additional content. So they're kinda like free DLC."
16-04-2020T21:04:44,Grip,Some mods fix bugs in the game and balance units that are too OP.
16-04-2020T21:04:50,BlackjackSec99,mods add flavor for when you are tired of plain vanilla
16-04-2020T21:04:54,johnnytho,"Dope, same"
