03-02-2020T00:19:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom sometimes has pins but it‚Äôs dependent on if the person that makes them does
03-02-2020T00:19:27,NickSteele,I mean I have a lackadaisy club pin? Kinda like that?

03-02-2020T00:22:51,SpazztasticKiwi,keyboards are cursed today
03-02-2020T00:23:20,NickSteele,"Btw, fun fact, last fall I'm 80% sure I met nibbly. I was waiting for my buddy to go fishing and this squirrel comes up to me and decides to hop up onto my boot and stare at me."
03-02-2020T00:23:34,NickSteele,"Kinda cool, kinda scary"
03-02-2020T00:23:52,NickSteele,"very intimidating, if squirrels can be intimidating that is"
03-02-2020T00:24:07,Ordithus,Cute.  Someone probably was feeding it
03-02-2020T00:24:51,NickSteele,"Probably haha, was in the middle of college campus in Cambridge mass"
03-02-2020T00:24:56,NickSteele,Not really the wild
03-02-2020T00:26:10,SpazztasticKiwi,there‚Äôs a town in Tennessee known for its population of albino squirrels
03-02-2020T00:26:51,AspiringNoodle,Always carry an emergency pack of nuts
03-02-2020T00:26:54,AspiringNoodle,Problem solved :P
03-02-2020T00:27:39,SpazztasticKiwi,the squirrels at my college campus sure had some acorns
03-02-2020T00:27:53,SpazztasticKiwi,they‚Äôd dart around right in front of you
03-02-2020T00:28:54,SpazztasticKiwi,forage right in the middle of the walking paths
03-02-2020T00:29:51,NickSteele,I'm gonna start feeding them if I can
03-02-2020T00:30:04,NickSteele,Get an army of squirrels on my side

03-02-2020T10:17:01,CrimsonQuill,'ullo
03-02-2020T10:24:24,CrimsonQuill,Sooo...anyone here not get out of bed till midday and realise they'd wasted the morning
03-02-2020T10:24:30,CrimsonQuill,having a lie in?
03-02-2020T10:34:48,JojoF2415,I‚Äôm in school
03-02-2020T10:35:18,JojoF2415,After that my physical exam
03-02-2020T10:35:26,CrimsonQuill,"Good luck,"
03-02-2020T10:35:38,CrimsonQuill,At least your day is happening
03-02-2020T10:35:50,CrimsonQuill,"I feel like my day hasn't even started, and it's 3:30pm here"
03-02-2020T10:40:06,CrRAR,Those are my weekends pretty much.
03-02-2020T10:40:46,CrRAR,"Got up a bit late today too, not to work till about 10AM."
03-02-2020T10:40:54,CrRAR,"s'okay, though"
03-02-2020T10:50:00,CrimsonQuill,Not for me..
03-02-2020T10:50:07,CrimsonQuill,It makes me feel asleep for most of the day
03-02-2020T10:50:12,CrimsonQuill,It's almost 4pm now
03-02-2020T10:50:23,CrimsonQuill,I feel like I'm only approaching midday
03-02-2020T10:50:25,CrimsonQuill,:(
03-02-2020T10:50:35,CrimsonQuill,It mucks up my internal clock.
03-02-2020T10:51:19,CrimsonQuill,I know for a fact that part of the reason I had such a lie in was because I was up until 2am yesterday night going through all the Patreon and DA pics and saving my favourites...
03-02-2020T11:35:00,CrRAR,"Yeah, I do need to work out a better routine."
03-02-2020T11:35:34,CrRAR,"Hop outta bed, exercise straight away."
03-02-2020T11:35:56,CrimsonQuill,"Good wakeup, that"
03-02-2020T11:36:01,CrRAR,"Also, that's time well spent, lol."
03-02-2020T11:36:25,CrimsonQuill,I kinda wanna redraw my banhammer battle
03-02-2020T11:36:33,CrimsonQuill,But with different poses and viewing angles.
03-02-2020T11:37:23,CrimsonQuill,"Just have Flora leaping from above, hammer over her head like a beserker, screaming in primal fury, with my OC's banhammer really tensed back, ready to swing up...that sort of thing."
03-02-2020T11:38:22,CrimsonQuill,"I mean, I drew the first Banhammer battle during a stream, not knowing if I could do it...and if i can draw that, why can't I draw it again, but even more OTT?"
03-02-2020T11:40:33,CrimsonQuill,At least...I'd do it... if I didn't feel like I should be sleeping in the afternoon
03-02-2020T11:40:45,CrimsonQuill,My mind is still mushy. Argh!
03-02-2020T11:48:57,JojoF2415,just keep trying in drawing the banhammer battle
03-02-2020T11:49:46,CrimsonQuill,Aheh
03-02-2020T11:49:47,CrimsonQuill,:)
03-02-2020T11:49:50,CrimsonQuill,thanks
03-02-2020T11:49:53,CrimsonQuill,Oh btw
03-02-2020T11:50:14,CrimsonQuill,I commissioned a Halo artist to render the custom armour of that OC
03-02-2020T11:50:21,CrimsonQuill,And....the process has been interesting.
03-02-2020T11:50:46,CrimsonQuill,Some armour pieces...didn't fit together as well as I had envisioned
03-02-2020T11:51:12,CrimsonQuill,But they've been keeping me up to date about it...I'll finally have a drawing reference for my OC's armour! :)
03-02-2020T12:07:33,CrRAR,nice
03-02-2020T13:24:58,AspiringNoodle,Fun tip:  diagonal orientation is great for action shots :D
03-02-2020T13:26:13,CrimsonQuill,That's what I had in mind! :)
03-02-2020T13:27:39,CrimsonQuill,Also heya Aspiring

03-02-2020T13:35:15,AspiringNoodle,And dark @_@
03-02-2020T13:35:47,CrimsonQuill,It was kind of trippy going to his 360 degree vision.
03-02-2020T13:35:50,CrimsonQuill,And hilarious.
03-02-2020T13:35:55,CrimsonQuill,Tom Holland and Will Smith!
03-02-2020T13:35:57,CrimsonQuill,XD
03-02-2020T13:36:04,CrimsonQuill,Now I kinda want to watch that film
03-02-2020T13:36:12,CrimsonQuill,I was a bit dismissive at the posters i saw
03-02-2020T13:36:17,CrimsonQuill,But this could be AWESOME
03-02-2020T13:36:20,AspiringNoodle,"""I can't NOT look at you! I can see MY butt and YOUR face at the same time!"""
03-02-2020T13:36:27,CrimsonQuill,XD
03-02-2020T13:36:43,AspiringNoodle,"And do it, find a theater"
03-02-2020T13:36:51,AspiringNoodle,You must see the 50 Shades of Yay.
03-02-2020T13:37:10,CrimsonQuill,Will do
03-02-2020T13:37:12,CrimsonQuill,Eventually
03-02-2020T13:37:19,AspiringNoodle,I'd do it quickly
03-02-2020T13:37:23,CrimsonQuill,When I figured out whether I'm awake or not
03-02-2020T13:37:25,AspiringNoodle,Theaters are most likely starting to phase it out

03-02-2020T13:37:40,CrimsonQuill,Damn lie in
03-02-2020T13:38:11,CrimsonQuill,I was literally up till 2am last night saving all the pics from the patreon and Deviantart that caught my eye.

03-02-2020T13:40:05,AspiringNoodle,"Pfft, I woke up about an hour ago.  Went to bed at 2:40 or so"
03-02-2020T13:40:15,AspiringNoodle,"Good 10 hours of sleep, I feel like I finally caught up :ptv-hearts:"
03-02-2020T13:43:59,CrimsonQuill,Neat for you

03-02-2020T13:44:10,CrimsonQuill,If I don't wake up at a decent hour

03-02-2020T14:12:25,AspiringNoodle,"Welp, time for another wonderful day of 2nd shift (the only shift I've ever known)"
03-02-2020T14:13:33,AspiringNoodle,"Maybe I'm not so much salty about the shift, as I am the constant forced interactions and standing on your feet for 8 hours :P"
03-02-2020T14:13:53,AspiringNoodle,Among the various other complaints I've listed 1000 times :ptv-snicker:
03-02-2020T14:14:01,CrimsonQuill,This is why I'm glad I work in a kitchen
03-02-2020T14:14:11,CrimsonQuill,I don't have too much interaction with too many people
03-02-2020T14:14:27,CrimsonQuill,just my co-workers and the people in the kitchennetes when I take the trolleys down
03-02-2020T14:15:27,CrimsonQuill,"A week ago though, a poor resident kept trying to come into the kitchenette from which I was collecting the trolley, and I had to call over the person who worked there to help, because I didn't really know how to hanle it..."
03-02-2020T14:15:57,CrimsonQuill,"The resident was very confused and probably forgetful, so that I understood."
03-02-2020T14:17:34,AspiringNoodle,"Friendly reminder that if you get mad at an employee and they've done nothing wrong, you're an asshole c:"
03-02-2020T14:17:54,AspiringNoodle,Forced human interaction is already wearing enough
03-02-2020T14:18:09,CrimsonQuill,True that.
03-02-2020T14:18:10,CrimsonQuill,BRB
03-02-2020T14:18:20,CrimsonQuill,Have to check on tonight's culinary abomintation

03-02-2020T14:25:24,AspiringNoodle,Retail in a nutshell
03-02-2020T14:25:58,AspiringNoodle,"Low pay, lots of responsibilities, constant customer interactions, poor treatment by some customers, indifferent by most, and nicely by some"
03-02-2020T14:26:05,AspiringNoodle,"""You should smile more"""

03-02-2020T14:26:35,CrimsonQuill,back
03-02-2020T14:35:06,CrimsonQuill,It can be hard to smile with stress
03-02-2020T14:36:19,AspiringNoodle,"I'm fairly certain that as long as you have a neutral expression, nobody really cares"
03-02-2020T14:36:42,CrimsonQuill,Aheh
03-02-2020T14:36:51,AspiringNoodle,"""Service with a smile"" doesn't mean jack at a gas station when most people are either grouchy, in a hurry, or ON THEIR FUCKING PHONES AT THE CHECKOUT."
03-02-2020T14:36:57,AspiringNoodle,Very RARELY is it an important call
03-02-2020T14:37:08,CrimsonQuill,Well
03-02-2020T14:37:12,CrimsonQuill,That's just rude
