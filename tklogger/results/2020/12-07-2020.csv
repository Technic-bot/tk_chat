12-07-2020T00:00:13,KeefMcDerpface,I don't think so.
12-07-2020T00:00:56,SpazztasticKiwi,cause those two flip & all I imagine is maren as nat like ‚Äúugh. hair. all. over. Imgoingtogoshave‚Äù
12-07-2020T00:01:12,SpazztasticKiwi,and nat as marens like ‚ÄúDONT YOU DARE‚Äù
12-07-2020T00:01:36,KeefMcDerpface,I don't even think we had a swap with Maren outside of species-swap.
12-07-2020T00:02:03,SpazztasticKiwi,this would just be a left field body swap
12-07-2020T00:02:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Marens been furry before but she‚Äôs still had her body
12-07-2020T00:02:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"also, there‚Äôs not been a Fox maren yet that I remember"
12-07-2020T00:02:48,SpazztasticKiwi,why. did it capitalize. fox.
12-07-2020T00:04:15,KeefMcDerpface,"tbh, I can see the swap happening between Maren and Sythe more so than Maren and Nat. But a Maren-Nat swap would be interesting."
12-07-2020T00:04:57,KeefMcDerpface,"Oh, come to think of it. Maren and Nibbly have swapped before."
12-07-2020T00:07:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"next, Maddie trying to nom tail"
12-07-2020T00:07:55,KeefMcDerpface,Who's?
12-07-2020T00:08:07,SpazztasticKiwi,"but the joke is she‚Äôs short for her race so, it turns into her chasing it"
12-07-2020T00:08:12,SpazztasticKiwi,her own...?
12-07-2020T00:08:33,KeefMcDerpface,"Ah, like a dog trying to catch it's own tail."
12-07-2020T00:08:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"off to the side, Maeve sniggering violently"
12-07-2020T00:11:19,SpazztasticKiwi,we‚Äôve had a maren sythe swap already
12-07-2020T00:11:50,KeefMcDerpface,So Maren has had swaps.
12-07-2020T00:12:29,KeefMcDerpface,Just not with Nat.
12-07-2020T00:23:28,CrimsonHelsing,"Forgot to say Tom, before I head out, thanks again for the stream, this has been an awesome day! Sleep well tonight, and we'll see you next time!"

12-07-2020T02:15:32,TerraTheWizard,whee
12-07-2020T02:16:35,TerraTheWizard,"i think there's a mode to play without the guy that chases you around, i think that's better because he doesn't add much beyond generic horror game stuff"
12-07-2020T02:20:19,AspiringNoodle,There is a safe mode for the game
12-07-2020T02:20:34,AspiringNoodle,"But I just learned the hard way that the abyss fishies don't give a flying f*** about your safe mode, they hungry!"
12-07-2020T02:21:01,AspiringNoodle,"The anglerfish was scary, but the viperfish are just a bunch of a-holes"
12-07-2020T02:21:59,AspiringNoodle,"They were right, btw"
12-07-2020T02:22:15,AspiringNoodle,"Even with safe mode on, the game is terrifying.  So much so that I still play like it isn't on, lol"
12-07-2020T02:24:18,AspiringNoodle,Well dis ain't good
12-07-2020T02:24:29,AspiringNoodle,There's a power suit active at TAU

12-07-2020T14:22:20,SpazztasticKiwi,anyone think a sketch of Erilas & Evals as kids would be cute?
12-07-2020T14:23:51,Twokinds,Could be
12-07-2020T14:34:44,SpazztasticKiwi,how far apart are they
12-07-2020T14:40:04,Twokinds,in what regard
12-07-2020T14:40:17,Azumachan,I'd say age
12-07-2020T14:40:50,Twokinds,They're probably within a year of each other
12-07-2020T14:40:59,Twokinds,"She's his big sister, so maybe a year or two older?"
12-07-2020T14:41:05,Twokinds,I hadn't really thought about it.
12-07-2020T14:41:26,Azumachan,A litter appart
12-07-2020T14:44:45,SpazztasticKiwi,cause she looks taller
12-07-2020T14:45:54,SpazztasticKiwi,I imagine as kids maybe they were the same height or Evals was slightly taller then puberty hit & Evals went nowhere while Erilas gained 3 inches
12-07-2020T15:48:58,AspiringNoodle,I think there'd be a cute factor if one was still in their pupper form while the other started walking upright

12-07-2020T16:39:37,CrRAR,Yeah xkcd showed it‚Äôs like 2.5 cadbury eggs
12-07-2020T16:39:54,AspiringNoodle,A 1 liter bottle of Brisk will run you about 190 - 210 calories and 49g of sugar
12-07-2020T16:40:51,AspiringNoodle,"So a big-azz bottle of brisk is 1.5 cans of cola, but 3x the content"
12-07-2020T16:40:55,CrRAR,Yeah not as bad
12-07-2020T16:41:42,AspiringNoodle,"Imho, we need to start taxing the overuse of sugar :/"

12-07-2020T16:44:49,AspiringNoodle,"Fat, interestingly, isn't that bad"
12-07-2020T16:45:14,CrRAR,I‚Äôve heard that
12-07-2020T16:45:14,AspiringNoodle,"The science linking it to all sorts of bad stuff is ironically one of the most flawed pieces of science, and honestly should be considered a historical scandal"
12-07-2020T16:45:25,CrRAR,Trans and saturated tho?
12-07-2020T16:45:30,AspiringNoodle,"Those, maybe"
12-07-2020T16:45:55,AspiringNoodle,"But the whole general sentiment of ""fat bad, sugar good"" can be linked back to a study that should be relegated to the ""do not do this"" bin"
12-07-2020T16:46:29,CrRAR,Oh yeah high sugar no good

12-07-2020T16:47:27,CrRAR,High sugar mosly just accelerates cell life cycles I would think
12-07-2020T16:47:58,CrRAR,It‚Äôs like stepping on the car‚Äôs accelerator at idle
12-07-2020T16:48:17,CrRAR,It just burns extra fuel and wears everything prematurely

12-07-2020T17:40:58,AspiringNoodle,"Well, I just got a group text to all employees at the store"
12-07-2020T17:41:16,AspiringNoodle,Lots of complaints about employees not wearing masks and how moving forward further complaints may be grounds for termination
12-07-2020T17:41:37,AspiringNoodle,"Yet afaik we're not actually enforcing the mask requirement for customers, even though we have the sign on the door"
12-07-2020T17:44:05,AspiringNoodle,"Legit, they required one of our previous employees to wear a mask, even though she had asthma and the masks on a semi-regular basis triggered it"
12-07-2020T17:44:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm not engaging this debate
12-07-2020T17:59:56,AspiringNoodle,"oof, Runescape (2001) don't mess around..."

12-07-2020T18:46:10,CrRAR,"yeah, I respect the hacking sentiment but it's really dumb when used to undermine otherwise rule fearing servers/games"
12-07-2020T18:46:24,AspiringNoodle,"Me: ""Think about all the ruined experiences they caused due to their actions.  The countless hours of developer time sunk into trying to prevent them from cheating."""
12-07-2020T18:46:54,CrRAR,"yeah, just play thr game fair if that's what the rules are"

12-07-2020T18:48:06,AspiringNoodle,So I stand by my position.  Destroy their computers / consoles.  Never let them play games again :ptv-laugh:

12-07-2020T18:48:31,AspiringNoodle,"Or just do what Blizzard did, it was so flippin' hilarious"
12-07-2020T18:49:08,AspiringNoodle,"When cheaters started flocking to Overwatch, they banned people in waves"
12-07-2020T18:49:27,AspiringNoodle,"What the cheaters didn't know was that they didn't just ban their account, they banned their hardware ID's"
12-07-2020T18:49:51,AspiringNoodle,They also probably flagged IP addresses just to keep an extra eye out
12-07-2020T18:50:01,CrRAR,"yeah, eventually people discover hoe a game ticks and crack it wide open"
12-07-2020T18:50:23,CrRAR,All it takes is memory address modifications
12-07-2020T18:50:26,AspiringNoodle,"So these cheaters would keep creating new accounts, change their IP address, etc, and buy Overwatch multiple times"
12-07-2020T18:50:37,CrRAR,That's why spending to prevent it is a little dumd
12-07-2020T18:50:41,AspiringNoodle,"But keep getting banned in short order, lol"
12-07-2020T18:50:41,CrRAR,dumb
12-07-2020T18:50:52,CrRAR,and the methods you mentioned may as well be used
12-07-2020T18:51:05,AspiringNoodle,Hardware bans are one of the more effective ones
12-07-2020T18:51:10,CrRAR,Lotta time and money spent on that policing though totally
12-07-2020T18:51:16,CrRAR,yeah
12-07-2020T18:51:19,AspiringNoodle,"It's not foolproof, but requires so much freakin' work to change them"
12-07-2020T18:51:39,AspiringNoodle,But it's been shown time and time again that cheaters would rather move on to a new game and cheat there then clean up their act
12-07-2020T18:51:58,AspiringNoodle,"""Once a cheater, always a cheater"" as they say"
12-07-2020T18:52:31,CrRAR,"yeah, most people just want to have fun and play the game lol"
12-07-2020T18:52:36,AspiringNoodle,Some serious games are starting to require 2FA
12-07-2020T18:52:44,AspiringNoodle,Most commonly a valid phone number
12-07-2020T18:52:59,AspiringNoodle,Cheaters started spoofing online numbers in an attempt to get around that requirement
12-07-2020T18:53:04,CrRAR,We'll ban you AND YOUR PHONE YOU RODE IN ON!
12-07-2020T18:53:13,AspiringNoodle,"But then the developers required validated numbers, something that's harder to do"

12-07-2020T18:53:28,CrRAR,:fire:
12-07-2020T18:53:31,AspiringNoodle,So developers more or less focus on the problem in 2 ways
12-07-2020T18:53:46,AspiringNoodle,1) Accurately identifying cheaters and removing them from play
12-07-2020T18:53:55,CrRAR,yup
12-07-2020T18:54:10,AspiringNoodle,2) Making the process of returning to the game so grueling that they either are required to clean up their act or move on
12-07-2020T18:54:34,CrRAR,It ID part isn't too hard once they know a hack they can just monitor peoples instances for those conditions and set the ban
12-07-2020T18:54:42,CrRAR,The*
12-07-2020T18:54:55,AspiringNoodle,There is a third option ;P
12-07-2020T18:55:04,AspiringNoodle,Jailing the cheat makers
12-07-2020T18:55:05,CrRAR,"""Oh this guy totally shouldn't have that many bullets"""
12-07-2020T18:55:08,CrRAR,*ban*
12-07-2020T18:55:22,AspiringNoodle,"In Asia (China in particular), cheating is a real big problem"
12-07-2020T18:55:30,AspiringNoodle,So much so that they're starting to jail people who make cheats
12-07-2020T18:55:40,CrRAR,oh dear
12-07-2020T18:55:59,CrRAR,well some games have higher stakes right?
12-07-2020T18:56:00,AspiringNoodle,And it makes sense.  You can ban people for using cheats left and right.  But as long as the dealer is still out there you'll never stop it.
12-07-2020T18:56:21,AspiringNoodle,Cheats are literally an arms race
12-07-2020T18:56:45,AspiringNoodle,"With developers banning cheats, the cheat makers making new versions that are undetectable again, and developers once again detecting the newer version"
12-07-2020T18:57:03,AspiringNoodle,"If you take out the dealer, then eventually all the previously made cheats will flag"
12-07-2020T18:57:15,CrRAR,yeah
12-07-2020T18:57:36,AspiringNoodle,"And if you feel sorry for them, don't lol"
12-07-2020T18:57:54,CrRAR,no they're undermining fair play
12-07-2020T18:58:02,CrRAR,in a fair arena
12-07-2020T18:58:11,CrRAR,that people paid for
12-07-2020T18:58:21,AspiringNoodle,"That's the principle at stake, but more realistically, they're facilitating the violation of company property"
12-07-2020T18:58:38,CrRAR,yeap
12-07-2020T18:59:02,AspiringNoodle,So you could actually charge them for causing damage to company property / image / revenue

12-07-2020T19:00:00,AspiringNoodle,"When the Overwatch ban waves were hitting full force, so many of these babies were crying on the forums about, ""HOW DARE BLIZZARD, I PAID $40, I BOUGHT THIS GAME, THEY CAN'T DO THIS!"""

12-07-2020T19:02:02,AspiringNoodle,"And in addition to merely paying for the ability to play (not own), they spell it out very clearly that if you do anything that gives you an unfair advantage outside of what's possible in-game, you will be banned"

12-07-2020T20:17:17,CrRAR,leatherface is the chainsaw guy right?
12-07-2020T20:17:53,SpazztasticKiwi,& anything else he gets his hands on

12-07-2020T20:20:24,CrRAR,"What was Leatherface's backstory, is he psychologically traumatised or just a supernatural psycho?"
12-07-2020T20:20:35,CrRAR,maybe both!
12-07-2020T20:20:51,SpazztasticKiwi,he was traumatized
12-07-2020T20:21:12,CrRAR,Ah him and Mike Myers can be best bros then
12-07-2020T20:21:31,SpazztasticKiwi,"but he was groomed sort of because unlike most other ‚Äúhead‚Äù killers, his family was the murderers"
12-07-2020T20:21:43,CrRAR,ohhhh
12-07-2020T20:21:43,SpazztasticKiwi,he lured them in & sometimes helped
12-07-2020T20:21:49,SpazztasticKiwi,that‚Äôs the thing
12-07-2020T20:22:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"in the comics, Jason & leatherface become friends"
12-07-2020T20:22:19,CrRAR,He kills you because he cares </3
12-07-2020T20:22:33,CrRAR,oh interesting
12-07-2020T20:22:38,SpazztasticKiwi,"Jason‚Äôs story is of course his family‚Äôs dead, save for his mother‚Äôs head that he keeps in his shed"
12-07-2020T20:22:59,CrRAR,yeah
12-07-2020T20:23:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"his dad was abusive because Jason was born deformed & he drank (garbage person, in a nutshell)"
12-07-2020T20:23:49,CrRAR,I knew Mike Myers history has to do with Loomis and Jason had the mom thing yeah
12-07-2020T20:23:56,SpazztasticKiwi,but leatherface and him find a truce/friendship with each other
12-07-2020T20:25:06,SpazztasticKiwi,"but when Jason comes to visit at leatherfaces home, he witnesses leatherfaces father/stepfather (can‚Äôt remember) hit him for not doing something right"
12-07-2020T20:25:34,SpazztasticKiwi,leatherface doesnt know better but Jason retaliates for him and throws the father across the room
12-07-2020T20:26:00,SpazztasticKiwi,"but all leatherface sees is his friend hit his father, so the fight is on"
12-07-2020T20:26:14,CrRAR,ah
12-07-2020T20:26:26,CrRAR,oof still respects the man
12-07-2020T20:26:36,CrRAR,so he internalizes it
12-07-2020T20:26:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Jason ends up getting attacked by the whole family but in the end he wins the whole fight
12-07-2020T20:26:48,CrRAR,and takes it out on unsuspecting victims!
12-07-2020T20:27:19,CrRAR,the rest of the family like... normal people or what?
12-07-2020T20:28:14,SpazztasticKiwi,"for whatever reason, their thing is sent leatherface out to lure people to the house to kill them"
12-07-2020T20:28:39,CrRAR,ah he's bait
12-07-2020T20:28:47,CrRAR,deadly... bait
12-07-2020T20:29:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"like I said, it starts when leatherface is young so he was effectively groomed not to really know better"
12-07-2020T20:29:36,CrRAR,yeah
12-07-2020T20:29:58,SpazztasticKiwi,& I‚Äôm pretty sure the family was cannibalistic
12-07-2020T20:30:30,SpazztasticKiwi,"it‚Äôs sad, eventhough this is murderers we‚Äôre talking about"
12-07-2020T20:31:04,CrRAR,A true nuclear family ;_;
12-07-2020T20:31:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Jason ends up just going back to his lake after leatherface is defeated & he‚Äôs knocked down the family and just goes back to sleep
12-07-2020T20:31:18,CrRAR,tryna make their way
12-07-2020T20:31:35,CrRAR,knocked down by car or what?
12-07-2020T20:31:54,CrRAR,or you mean kill't
12-07-2020T20:32:17,SpazztasticKiwi,he killed or maimed the ones that attacked him once he hit the father/leatherface struck
12-07-2020T20:32:36,CrRAR,ah well then all in a days work
12-07-2020T20:32:43,CrRAR,explains the sleep lol
12-07-2020T20:33:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"I‚Äôve noticed a theme with Jason is he‚Äôs not the kill to kill type - in most of the movies, he hits when hit"
12-07-2020T20:33:56,SpazztasticKiwi,he didn‚Äôt bother leatherfaces dad until he saw what pushed his mother to kill his father: hitting their son
12-07-2020T20:34:04,CrRAR,Yeah some horror characters use that as a formality

12-07-2020T20:35:41,SpazztasticKiwi,just slightly
12-07-2020T20:36:27,SpazztasticKiwi,he might be my favorite because it‚Äôs like ‚Äúdid you just hit me? you have lost your head privileges‚Äù
12-07-2020T20:37:12,SpazztasticKiwi,& considering he died at that camp & kills the teens that are dumb enough to still trespass..

12-07-2020T20:40:25,SpazztasticKiwi,there‚Äôs big problems in the comic-to-movie & comic vs movie aspect
12-07-2020T20:41:12,SpazztasticKiwi,big example is the movies let it known that his father is ‚Äúmissing‚Äù or ‚Äúrun away‚Äù for the most part
12-07-2020T20:41:46,SpazztasticKiwi,but the comics explain that his mother killed his father after she caught him beating Jason
