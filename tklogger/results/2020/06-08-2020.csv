06-08-2020T01:11:43,Dadrobit,"Jesus fuck, Spazz. You know what that was is? That's a Midwestern Mountain Fuckoffenmoveout."
06-08-2020T01:12:52,Dadrobit,"But for real, it looks like a cow at a bad angle with bad lighting."
06-08-2020T01:13:30,Dadrobit,And a fair amount of wide angel camera distortion.
06-08-2020T01:13:39,Dadrobit,Angle*
06-08-2020T01:14:21,AspiringNoodle,"Haha, :cow: go: ""I WILL DEVOUR YOUR SOUL."""
06-08-2020T01:15:07,AspiringNoodle,Hey dadro
06-08-2020T01:15:11,Dadrobit,Cows are good beasts. They're like giant dogs.
06-08-2020T01:15:17,Dadrobit,Giant tasty dogs
06-08-2020T01:15:25,Dadrobit,o/
06-08-2020T01:15:37,AspiringNoodle,I blitzed through so much of Dark Souls 3 today
06-08-2020T01:16:06,SpazztasticKiwi,"how, pray tell, - and why - is there a cow in the middle of a city"
06-08-2020T01:16:17,AspiringNoodle,*googles Big City Greens*
06-08-2020T01:16:22,SpazztasticKiwi,"one of the bigger cities of the state, I’ll add"
06-08-2020T01:17:29,Dadrobit,Escaped cow?
06-08-2020T01:18:47,Dadrobit,What city?
06-08-2020T01:18:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Huntsville
06-08-2020T01:21:58,Dadrobit,"Yeah, Alabama has plenty of farmland for a cattle breakout."
06-08-2020T01:23:10,Dadrobit,The infrared wide angle is just screwing with the face a bunch.
06-08-2020T01:24:06,Dadrobit,Least that's my guess
06-08-2020T01:25:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I know either she or her mom once posted a picture of a cow in their apartment complex in the middle of town
06-08-2020T01:25:23,SpazztasticKiwi,half sure it was her mother
06-08-2020T01:26:04,SpazztasticKiwi,"a whole cow, walking through the complex like it’s browsing the availability"
06-08-2020T01:26:28,Dadrobit,"I mean, it happens here too. Phoenix is the 5th largest city in the US and we have cattle not 10 minutes away."
06-08-2020T01:26:42,Dadrobit,They escape and just roam a bit.
06-08-2020T01:27:28,Dadrobit,"Funny picture though, legit caught me off guard."
06-08-2020T01:28:38,SpazztasticKiwi,I saw it scroll across my fb feed & thought Phe was playing with ouiji boards in a graveyard
06-08-2020T01:28:55,Dadrobit,Lol
06-08-2020T01:29:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I told her that was an eviction notice - time to move tf out
06-08-2020T01:30:34,Dadrobit,"I'll catch javelinas, coyotes, and bobcats peering into my infrared license plate cameras sometimes at night and boy, it is not flattering to see them up close in harsh monochrome."
06-08-2020T01:30:45,SpazztasticKiwi,half tempted to tell her send the boyfriend out - they get to investigate what goes bump in the night
06-08-2020T01:32:16,Dadrobit,"Animal control kinda gets paid to do that, I'd use them before a boyfriend first."
06-08-2020T01:32:40,SpazztasticKiwi,“y’all handle demon collection?”
06-08-2020T01:32:56,AspiringNoodle,"""Y'all ever play Diablo 2?"""

06-08-2020T01:34:02,SpazztasticKiwi,hey MA! there’s this weird lookin cat outside!
06-08-2020T01:34:28,Dadrobit,I will NEVER own one of those. They are the single most pointless animals on planet Earth.
06-08-2020T01:34:52,SpazztasticKiwi,chihuahuas?
06-08-2020T01:34:55,Dadrobit,Yes
06-08-2020T01:35:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"I don’t care for their spelling, personally"
06-08-2020T01:35:27,Dadrobit,"If you want a lap dog, get a Shiba. Or a Corgi."
06-08-2020T01:35:32,SpazztasticKiwi,my moms dog is half chihuahua
06-08-2020T01:35:49,SpazztasticKiwi,more whine in that thing than a vineyard
06-08-2020T01:36:28,Dadrobit,I just... I just don't get the appeal. At all!
06-08-2020T01:37:01,SpazztasticKiwi,they’d be good or at least ok if they weren’t raised to be satans cheerleaders
06-08-2020T01:37:41,Dadrobit,Little bug eyed bastards aren't even nice to look at though.
06-08-2020T01:37:44,SpazztasticKiwi,corgis got those lil fluffy butts

06-08-2020T01:38:48,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m not a little dog fan
06-08-2020T01:39:08,SpazztasticKiwi,not even a dog fan period but the little ones.....poorly contained rage
06-08-2020T01:39:54,Dadrobit,The bigger the better. Even Oreo I consider to be on the smaller size.
06-08-2020T01:41:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Oreo strikes me as mildly contained shites & giggles
06-08-2020T01:41:34,Dadrobit,No. You've only seen him in pictures. He is all energy.
06-08-2020T01:41:49,SpazztasticKiwi,poorly contained then
06-08-2020T01:41:50,Dadrobit,"And maybe the one with the laser, did you see that?"
06-08-2020T01:42:04,SpazztasticKiwi,I was present
06-08-2020T01:42:54,Dadrobit,He is very much still in his puppy phase. Lately I've gotten him to just lie and relax a bit with me. But it's rare.
06-08-2020T01:44:57,Dadrobit,At least he's gotten better with chewing.

06-08-2020T01:45:12,Dadrobit,Now he's all about licking.
06-08-2020T01:45:54,SpazztasticKiwi,we interrupt this feed to bring an idiots anonymous news break
06-08-2020T01:45:58,SpazztasticKiwi,I would be beating this fool back with a rolling pin https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/524825976597643265/741132149226209350/image1.jpg
06-08-2020T01:46:11,Dadrobit,"(I say that, immediately remembering that he just chewed up his crate blanket last week...)"
06-08-2020T01:46:32,SpazztasticKiwi,he killed the bear
06-08-2020T01:46:39,SpazztasticKiwi,you should be proud
06-08-2020T01:47:17,Dadrobit,https://imgur.com/a/a5XglbT It was an inevitability after he got the eye.
06-08-2020T01:48:05,Dadrobit,"Also, boy oh boy, I'd be a furious cashier in that position."
06-08-2020T01:48:23,AspiringNoodle,I've accepted this as reality a long time ago
06-08-2020T01:48:35,Dadrobit,Most likely I'd just be maliciously sarcastic to the customer if I were in that position.
06-08-2020T01:48:36,AspiringNoodle,"The more you try to make something dumbass proof, God will make better dumbasses"
06-08-2020T01:48:41,SpazztasticKiwi,literally facepalming
06-08-2020T01:49:39,SpazztasticKiwi,“sir we offer disability services for those with difficulties”
06-08-2020T01:50:39,SpazztasticKiwi,how about the mask fitting mirrors in target?

06-08-2020T01:52:26,Dadrobit,"I only ever had to pull the ""I reserve the right to refuse service"" card twice in three years. But man, if I were a cashier today? My store would fire me so damn quick."
06-08-2020T01:53:33,AspiringNoodle,The only time I've refused service was when a guy was so visibly drunk that it was straight up illegal for me to sell him more beer
06-08-2020T01:53:46,AspiringNoodle,"On the bright side, dude was super chill about it"
06-08-2020T01:54:04,AspiringNoodle,"Didn't argue, didn't get angry.  Just kinda accepted it and walked out."
06-08-2020T01:54:18,AspiringNoodle,Honestly surprising
06-08-2020T01:54:28,SpazztasticKiwi,he’s probably already forgotten what question he’d asked
06-08-2020T01:54:49,Dadrobit,"Oh, sure, I've done that a bunch of times. But they always got the rest of the groceries. I'm just talking about the times folks were so disrespectful that I just told them to fuck off to Wal Mart."
06-08-2020T01:54:51,SpazztasticKiwi,heard the no and was like “aiight”
06-08-2020T01:55:04,Dadrobit,"No offense, Spazz."
06-08-2020T01:55:31,SpazztasticKiwi,where in that is offense to me
06-08-2020T01:55:48,Dadrobit,You work for Wal Mart no?
06-08-2020T01:56:07,AspiringNoodle,"""Not my department, tell it to someone who gives a fuck."""

06-08-2020T01:56:13,SpazztasticKiwi,yea
06-08-2020T01:56:37,SpazztasticKiwi,but I mean garbage people are gonna go somewhere
06-08-2020T01:57:07,SpazztasticKiwi,walmarts known for bunches cause they get candy and a sticker for their attitude
06-08-2020T01:57:18,Dadrobit,Sometimes they went to Albertsons with buckets full of change.
06-08-2020T01:57:25,SpazztasticKiwi,rather than a high five to the face with a steel chair by hulk
06-08-2020T01:57:31,SpazztasticKiwi,we’ve had people mad who go to foodland for cakes and we recommend it sometimes
06-08-2020T01:58:03,SpazztasticKiwi,there’s other resources around - we’ll still get profits without your whiny arse
06-08-2020T01:58:11,AspiringNoodle,I just wish all retailers would simultaneously adopt the same policy of kicking out a-holes instead of rewarding them
06-08-2020T01:58:11,Dadrobit,I actually don't think I used Wal Mart as a threat that often. Usually it was WinCo since it was closer
06-08-2020T01:58:26,AspiringNoodle,It's so stupid that society is rewarding people for being children and downright morons
06-08-2020T01:58:40,SpazztasticKiwi,how is walmart a threat?
06-08-2020T01:58:50,AspiringNoodle,Try k-mart :ptv-snicker:
06-08-2020T01:59:38,Dadrobit,"Because they (I'm not joking) are classier, better people for shopping at Albertsons instead."
06-08-2020T01:59:48,Dadrobit,Because they think*
06-08-2020T02:00:29,SpazztasticKiwi,some people think walmarts the place for family reunions along with Christmas shopping
06-08-2020T02:01:10,Dadrobit,(Note for the reader: I shop almost exclusively at Wal Mart as well)
06-08-2020T02:01:29,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s really the only main source here too
06-08-2020T02:02:06,AspiringNoodle,"Honestly, the government should probably address ""Walmart syndrome"""
06-08-2020T02:02:36,AspiringNoodle,"Walmart gets built, most other businesses go out of business, only remaining source of goods / jobs becomes Walmart"
06-08-2020T02:02:48,Dadrobit,"My main squeeze, the local Bashas went out of business late last year. Wal Mart is legit the only thing left within several miles. There are like 4 nearby and a Fry's way the fuck out of the way."
06-08-2020T02:02:49,SpazztasticKiwi,deli meat is only so expensive cause you got someone cutting it for you on maybe a different thickness
06-08-2020T02:02:52,AspiringNoodle,"And if Walmart ever leaves, the local economy is forever ruined :|"
06-08-2020T02:04:09,Dadrobit,"Damn, I ordered some spicy wings and now I'm kinda regretting it. Didn't think they'd be actually spicy."
06-08-2020T02:04:20,Dadrobit,Shits hot yo
06-08-2020T02:04:26,SpazztasticKiwi,one guy was on his high high about me telling him the meats are good in the case for 6 days but he was on about how it goes bad in 3 sitting in his fridge so he wants a fresh chub cut for his
06-08-2020T02:05:15,SpazztasticKiwi,like the chubs we get are killed right outside & processed to plop in the display cooler
06-08-2020T02:05:32,AspiringNoodle,Any reason they might be going bad within 3 days for the guy?
06-08-2020T02:05:42,Dadrobit,ThAts whY The StOreS so BiG
06-08-2020T02:06:02,Dadrobit,There's a slaughter house right in the back
06-08-2020T02:06:26,SpazztasticKiwi,"see, the chubs are likely older than just 6 days because it’s got to be killed, processed, fixed with whatever seasonings/aged or whatever idunno.."
06-08-2020T02:06:47,SpazztasticKiwi,then sealed and thrown on however many trucks to drive to is
06-08-2020T02:06:49,SpazztasticKiwi,us
06-08-2020T02:07:34,SpazztasticKiwi,the date is 3 days from when you purchase it as a high quality freshness guideline
06-08-2020T02:08:31,SpazztasticKiwi,"as long as it’s sealed and refrigerated and 14 people aren’t grabbing out of the bag with dirty hands or it’s left out on the counter, it could be ok for *gasp* 4 or more days"
06-08-2020T02:08:46,SpazztasticKiwi,"if you want to throw it out after the three, that’s your money"
06-08-2020T02:09:18,AspiringNoodle,"Also, if it's *that* mucho f a problem, just freeze it?"
06-08-2020T02:09:24,AspiringNoodle,Good until whenever freezer burn sets it

06-08-2020T02:10:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Asgard?
06-08-2020T02:10:34,SpazztasticKiwi,burn the whole thing down
06-08-2020T02:11:33,SpazztasticKiwi,there’s people on the planet that survived to where they are now through sheer luck of a chronic dumbass
06-08-2020T02:12:06,SpazztasticKiwi,they’re the ones that couldn’t pour water out of a shoe if the instructions were on the heel
06-08-2020T02:13:59,Dadrobit,"My mouth is on fire and I need a glass, and these motherfuckers are making me clean up their dirty ass shit before I can get a drink."
06-08-2020T02:14:55,Dadrobit,99% sure I know who it is. Same dude who refuses to cover his food in the microwave and only remembers to wash his hands after using the bathroom when I give him a dirty look.
06-08-2020T02:15:31,Dadrobit,And I have to trust they're being Covid concious when I'm not around? Fat fukkin chance...
06-08-2020T02:21:20,SpazztasticKiwi,get somebody to whisper there’s a health inspector or secret investigator coming by sometime to look for poor behavior
06-08-2020T02:21:35,SpazztasticKiwi,then let a friend “visit” shortly after
06-08-2020T02:21:57,SpazztasticKiwi,"even if it’s fake, it might spook some into acting right"
06-08-2020T02:22:18,SpazztasticKiwi,next on “tv show ideas”...
06-08-2020T02:23:18,SpazztasticKiwi,can you bring a exercise bottle to work you can use?
06-08-2020T02:24:10,SpazztasticKiwi,no need for work cups - although I question why they don’t try paper cups even before corona because flu and poor hygiene are still a thing
06-08-2020T02:24:32,AspiringNoodle,The convenience store I work at doesn't allow refills or personal cups
06-08-2020T02:24:47,AspiringNoodle,Employees can use teh small courtesy cups we give out for ice / water
06-08-2020T02:24:57,AspiringNoodle,"And once you've emptied it, it needs to be tossed"
06-08-2020T02:30:05,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I know a couple folks bring their own water bottles. I bring my own silverware."
06-08-2020T02:31:11,Dadrobit,One guard brings his own electric stove and a wok for his stir fry-day.
06-08-2020T02:42:50,AspiringNoodle,Night peeps
06-08-2020T02:44:29,SpazztasticKiwi,at what point did they move their whole kitchen in
06-08-2020T02:51:11,Dadrobit,The guard houses here are literally houses. Plenty of room for stuffs like that.
06-08-2020T02:51:23,Twokinds,:house:

06-08-2020T03:11:04,SpazztasticKiwi,a 🐿 but no squirrel
06-08-2020T03:12:23,SpazztasticKiwi,kirby is strong independent pink blob who supports himself
06-08-2020T03:14:41,SpazztasticKiwi,wonky faze of being tired is settling in
06-08-2020T03:16:49,Dadrobit,Probably gonna head off chat soon and put on a movie.
06-08-2020T03:17:50,SpazztasticKiwi,🎥
06-08-2020T03:17:52,Dadrobit,Got a couple Ghibli films on the phone. Went through Howls Moving Castle last night.
06-08-2020T03:18:13,Dadrobit,Still a pretty excellent movie.
06-08-2020T03:18:43,SpazztasticKiwi,man first time I saw that movie I wanted to order me a howl
06-08-2020T03:19:12,Dadrobit,Lol
06-08-2020T03:20:52,Dadrobit,"First saw it when I was 13 or 14. Thought he was pretty cool. Now as an adult I'm just like, ""Huh, this guy's just kind of a whiny kid"""
06-08-2020T03:21:12,Dadrobit,Which... Is kind of the point. But still.
06-08-2020T03:22:57,SpazztasticKiwi,"if you don’t get over your pity party, boy, I swear to God... 🥿"
06-08-2020T03:23:34,Dadrobit,Probably watch Princess Mononoke next. Get to watch San yell about how she's totally not a human and definitely a wolf again.
06-08-2020T03:23:54,Dadrobit,S'been a long time since I watched that one

06-08-2020T03:24:45,Dadrobit,Jesus fuck this dialogue

06-08-2020T20:26:26,Rainelover,Well most of his drawings I see are the twokinds sketchs and their colured versions
06-08-2020T20:26:52,Nekonny,"Need to figure out how much of this comic I actually have left to draw ^_^"""

06-08-2020T20:28:42,CrimsonHelsing,"Hell, the Legacy Estate itself was a painting when it was first revealed in chapter 19"
06-08-2020T20:28:53,Ordithus,:eyes: that's some power alright
06-08-2020T20:28:54,Nekonny,and page 8 is a bit lazy on the background art...
06-08-2020T20:29:47,Zakuru,Tom you're doing an amazing job!!
06-08-2020T20:29:51,CrRAR,awww happy kitty
06-08-2020T20:29:57,Rainelover,"True, I just don’t pay attention to the background’s very much unless they pertain to the actual story or situation being drawn"
06-08-2020T20:29:58,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Would boop
06-08-2020T20:30:04,SageSaga,Lazy backgrounds are ok so long as the location is already known enough and so long as the important information isnt in the background
06-08-2020T20:30:08,Stormagedon,Clap for da Tom
06-08-2020T20:30:15,CrRAR,or he's munching on something xD
06-08-2020T20:30:23,CrRAR,like a lil birb
06-08-2020T20:30:32,Zakuru,what would be considered a lazy background Sage?
06-08-2020T20:30:34,Nekonny,Í'll go with that sage
06-08-2020T20:30:52,microbuss,hope the birb is fried chicken! :P
06-08-2020T20:31:04,CrRAR,:ccrrar-chickcr:
06-08-2020T20:31:09,Nekonny,Proably a gradient background
06-08-2020T20:31:15,SageSaga,most of my Yosh Backgrounds
06-08-2020T20:31:43,SageSaga,people who pay attention should be able to tell where most of my characters are based on the wall color XD
06-08-2020T20:31:55,SageSaga,so if i have green walls- its Phil and Kates bedroom
06-08-2020T20:32:08,SageSaga,Blue walls is the rest of their apartment
06-08-2020T20:32:20,SageSaga,Purple Walls- Blue's Bedroom
06-08-2020T20:32:27,CrRAR,oh I think it's swimming
06-08-2020T20:32:28,Zakuru,o-oooh
06-08-2020T20:32:41,Tharkis,nekonny claims to be bad at backgrounds but he does lots of awesome ones all the time >_<
06-08-2020T20:32:50,Ordithus,^

06-08-2020T20:33:28,KeefMcDerpface,\o
06-08-2020T20:33:33,Nekonny,I dont quite have a task for today
06-08-2020T20:34:37,Ordithus,tigers do like to swim
06-08-2020T20:34:50,TerrificTwenty,Those plugs are from the Oculus Rift
06-08-2020T20:35:00,w0lfmare,I try to balance my backgrounds
06-08-2020T20:35:28,Zakuru,i copy and past my bgs sometimes but i wouldn't call them lazy... aaaaall the time lol
06-08-2020T20:35:37,SageSaga,sometimes a solid color is a great background
06-08-2020T20:35:43,Zakuru,^
06-08-2020T20:35:47,w0lfmare,"Backgrounds can be really pretty and set the scene. They can be really important. But, they can also take up a lot of time"
06-08-2020T20:35:56,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Bg go back and forth from fun and ""What am I doing?"""
06-08-2020T20:36:22,w0lfmare,So I believe in comics the balance is between looking good and being efficient
06-08-2020T20:37:14,Nekonny,it's not so bad anymore TT ^^'
06-08-2020T20:37:19,SageSaga,since Yosh gets updated so often i do a lot less background work
06-08-2020T20:37:29,Nekonny,heya wolf
06-08-2020T20:37:37,CrRAR,efficient
06-08-2020T20:37:44,w0lfmare,"Yeah sometimes just a color works for a background, particularly for an emotion, or to keep the focus up front on the character"
06-08-2020T20:37:46,Ordithus,this is looking great Tom
06-08-2020T20:37:49,RileyTheRiolu,"hello everyone, just came in to watch Tom's stream. Hope you're all doing good, especially do all the other streamers!"

06-08-2020T20:38:37,RileyTheRiolu,I've been doing good! Just came to watch the stream
06-08-2020T20:38:44,RileyTheRiolu,"I will most likely lurk, to be honest"
06-08-2020T20:38:54,RileyTheRiolu,"I might talk about my works here and there, but eh"
06-08-2020T20:38:57,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"It is decided, new desktop bg"
06-08-2020T20:39:03,CrRAR,haha
06-08-2020T20:39:07,w0lfmare,I've been trying to up my background game lately. I've been too lazy
06-08-2020T20:39:17,SageSaga,I can easily see Tom's painting work in an RPG book or on MTG cards and such- which is to say I think hes more than skilled enough  to do some fantastic pieces that arent just for his comic work
06-08-2020T20:39:34,w0lfmare,Particularly in building my cities and making them immersive
06-08-2020T20:39:34,CrRAR,Keith-o-vision's gone HD apparently
06-08-2020T20:39:39,RileyTheRiolu,My background I found on the US Marines website. It's real cool.

06-08-2020T20:49:22,CrRAR,haha
06-08-2020T20:49:57,RileyTheRiolu,I never really knew back then that Tigers know how to swim. I just thought all cats would hate water
06-08-2020T20:50:02,SageSaga,here's a question- if you had a Tiger born in a place with no watering holes large enough to swim in- could they swim if they eventually were put near a lake?
06-08-2020T20:50:13,RileyTheRiolu,Good question...
06-08-2020T20:50:14,Nekonny,yes
06-08-2020T20:50:17,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Yep
06-08-2020T20:50:23,SageSaga,why?
06-08-2020T20:50:30,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Instincts
06-08-2020T20:50:36,KeefMcDerpface,Instincts kick in?
06-08-2020T20:50:39,Nekonny,because a lake... is watering holes large enough to swim in
06-08-2020T20:50:43,TheSexyBeast,RNA
06-08-2020T20:50:46,Ordithus,"heck a baby can swim, then they forget how"

06-08-2020T20:58:06,Ordithus,"the play cats with the costumes was not too weird.  haven't seen the movie but based on how people describe it, probably better"
06-08-2020T20:58:10,w0lfmare,Is it still truly live action if there's human and CGI characters?

06-08-2020T21:53:58,SageSaga,you probably want a friend to do it if you got something stuck up there

06-08-2020T21:54:59,SageSaga,you probably want someone who can see what they are getting at with a pair of long handle tweezers
06-08-2020T21:55:00,ZRO4825,Sage...this sounds like something with a “This may have happened.” behind it.

06-08-2020T22:02:12,Keeeef,I need your wit in my head. Im working on my own game and it takes forever to think up the code I need :/
06-08-2020T22:02:38,BADBackgroundProductions,You too!!!?
06-08-2020T22:02:54,MuonNeutrino,i wonder if tom has an estimate in his head how many pages he thinks the whole story will take heh
06-08-2020T22:02:59,Keeeef,? Your making a game as well?
06-08-2020T22:03:44,Twokinds,10000
06-08-2020T22:03:50,KeefMcDerpface,We had someone else earlier who has plans to make a game as well. But it would seem they left.
06-08-2020T22:03:52,KeefMcDerpface,"lol, Tom"
06-08-2020T22:03:55,BADBackgroundProductions,"Well, right now I’m only making 3D models of objects around my house in blender but that’s the plan!"

06-08-2020T22:04:00,w0lfmare,I'm making a game!

06-08-2020T22:04:47,BADBackgroundProductions,You’re doing that too?
06-08-2020T22:04:54,Keeeef,The engine I'm using is comparable to using an easier user friendly sdl
06-08-2020T22:04:57,K3IDRAN,I almost forgot
06-08-2020T22:05:08,Keeeef,So I'll have to add in all the add-ons and stuff I need
06-08-2020T22:05:28,K3IDRAN,What about the Source Engine Valve uses
06-08-2020T22:05:34,Keeeef,Planned to make my own from scratch on opengl but opengl sucks
06-08-2020T22:05:46,Keeeef,Source engine is not open source. Can't use it afaik

06-08-2020T22:06:12,Keeeef,Only valve people can use it. You'd have to buy license and software to use it I think

06-08-2020T22:06:47,Keeeef,JavaScript? Good luck. Something like that won't allow for much optimisation which is what you want on a 3d engine
06-08-2020T22:07:02,Keeeef,I'm doing mine in c++
06-08-2020T22:07:14,BADBackgroundProductions,"Oh, well, what should I do then?"

06-08-2020T22:49:36,KeefMcDerpface,"I don't think they allow people to take a dip in the pond at the park, Ord."
06-08-2020T22:49:46,BADBackgroundProductions,I wonder if there is some obscure emoji that picarto does not have a replacement for?
06-08-2020T22:49:56,Twokinds,This was just supposed to be a quick warmup. XD But I think I'm gunna call it done for now.

06-08-2020T23:18:44,Davoerlo,go dog go and cat in the hat
06-08-2020T23:19:05,Osean,I have read 6 good sized books in the past two weeks

06-08-2020T23:20:03,Nekonny,There's 6 drawings in all
06-08-2020T23:20:07,SageSaga,i wish i had more time to read but i got so much work to do
06-08-2020T23:20:27,Nekonny,"actually, it's 3 dawings, and each has a variation"
06-08-2020T23:21:16,SageSaga,"all the negative reviews for the Soap book were like ""That ending!"" ""how could they end a book like that?!"" ""That ending came out of nowhere! 1 Star!"""
06-08-2020T23:21:25,SageSaga,so i was really excited to see this ending
06-08-2020T23:22:02,SageSaga,and all it was was a cliff hanger of the MC about to get Raped- and it was clearly coming so i dont know what that person was saying -
06-08-2020T23:22:50,SageSaga,"but i just picked up the next book and was like ""Ok- how do they stop her from getting raped-"" *Boyfriend explodes the wall* ""Yep- that seems about right"""
06-08-2020T23:23:43,SageSaga,it was so obvious she wasnt going to be subjected to that- the book is too happy and nice to go from cute and happy to grimdark
06-08-2020T23:24:07,Tharkis,"i'm reading hte LNs for log horizon atm, i never actually read them before, but i like the anime, and with it getting a 3rd season figured i should read up"
06-08-2020T23:24:21,Tharkis,after i'm done that i'll probably pick up bookworm
06-08-2020T23:24:29,SageSaga,im gonna start reading ReZero once the second season is over
06-08-2020T23:24:30,Tharkis,which i think is also getting a 3rd season of anime
06-08-2020T23:24:56,SageSaga,bookworm book is better than the anime but the anime is nice
06-08-2020T23:25:31,Nekonny,It's been a while since I read a book
06-08-2020T23:25:31,Tharkis,arent there like almost 40 books for bookworm in japanese already? and only half of them in english? heh
06-08-2020T23:25:39,Nekonny,I read a lot fof news articles
06-08-2020T23:25:39,SageSaga,33
06-08-2020T23:25:46,Nekonny,not sure if that qualifies
06-08-2020T23:26:17,Tharkis,"jeeze, that makes bookworm longer (or at least more volumes) than any LN i've read yet =P"
06-08-2020T23:26:18,SageSaga,it doesnt- ya gotta read fiction to get better at writing fiction
06-08-2020T23:26:24,SageSaga,reality is just too crazy
06-08-2020T23:26:32,Ordithus,indeed
06-08-2020T23:26:38,Tharkis,"and i've keept up with spice and wolf (and wolf and parchment) shield hero, etc over the years"
06-08-2020T23:26:39,Nekonny,"Aside from the Bible, I think the last one I read were the inheritance series"
06-08-2020T23:27:13,Tharkis,those had potential and then ... kinda fewll flat
06-08-2020T23:27:17,Tharkis,fell flat even
06-08-2020T23:27:53,Tharkis,"i mean, i liked the books just fine"
06-08-2020T23:28:01,Tharkis,but holy crap did they screw the pooch with the movie
06-08-2020T23:28:10,Tharkis,that terribad movie basically killed the franchise
06-08-2020T23:28:33,Werewing,"Yeah, Disney has been doing that with their adaptions of anything newer than Brothers Grimm."
06-08-2020T23:28:49,Nekonny,oh well

06-08-2020T23:36:09,Ordithus,"that's slightly larger than the book, noodle"
06-08-2020T23:36:29,w0lfmare,7 x 10.5 is the standard magazine size
06-08-2020T23:37:16,SageSaga,when drawing comics on paper they were usually drawn on 11x17
06-08-2020T23:37:37,SageSaga,then cropped and scaled down

06-08-2020T23:52:56,AspiringNoodle,"If Kiwi missed all the thinks, then is Kiwi even conscious?"
06-08-2020T23:53:05,SpazztasticKiwi,sometimes I’m only half so

06-08-2020T23:55:07,Dadrobit,"Space is not time, the two are just immediately related to one another. Like conjoined twins sharing a liver."
06-08-2020T23:55:10,SageSaga,they said the amazon order was lost and are sending a new one- but it was gonna take 2 weeks to get here
06-08-2020T23:55:34,SpazztasticKiwi,you’re not having to pay for the reshipment are you
