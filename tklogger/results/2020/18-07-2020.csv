18-07-2020T13:27:04,IronHorseComics,how's the plot for world domination coming along?
18-07-2020T13:28:56,RimaDraws,mine i dont know but tom's probably better
18-07-2020T13:32:52,IronHorseComics,mine involves the anthology book that Drunk Duck is looking to bring back and announce the theme so that I can come up with a story for it. If all goes well it'll be the first time I get published
18-07-2020T13:34:18,IronHorseComics,":cironhorsecomics-HyperShawa: As you can tell, I'm very excited about this"
18-07-2020T13:35:07,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
18-07-2020T13:36:05,RimaDraws,mine involves actually taking over the world
18-07-2020T13:36:06,RimaDraws,jk
18-07-2020T13:38:12,IronHorseComics,oh Drunk Duck used to have annual anthology books printed with short stories by the creators on the site. They hadn't done it in a while and they decided to bring it back as a fundraiser to update the UI on the site
18-07-2020T13:48:34,K3IDRAN,@Twokinds yo Tom have you played. Medal of Honor before?
18-07-2020T13:51:46,Twokinds,Uh...

18-07-2020T13:53:05,Twokinds,IronHorse: Oh yeah? It's going now?

18-07-2020T13:55:13,IronHorseComics,they haven't announced the theme yet and I'm hoping it's nothing to do with the pandemic because that would really beating a dead horse
18-07-2020T13:55:25,Twokinds,Yeah
18-07-2020T13:55:31,K3IDRAN,"You're supposed to throw the grenade, not the pin"

18-07-2020T13:55:54,IronHorseComics,"but in the event that it does end up being the pandemic, I got a story idea where I can have some fun with it"

18-07-2020T14:49:37,CrRAR,"Maybe they'll put in a standalone atm somewhere, we have a lonely ATM in the corner of one of the supermarkets nearby."

18-07-2020T15:13:11,Roughlandin,Can we all just agree that the semi-colon needs to be retired?
18-07-2020T15:13:26,BadFoMo,Why?
18-07-2020T15:13:50,SpazztasticKiwi,because it’s halfway there
18-07-2020T15:13:53,Combak,It has its uses.
18-07-2020T15:14:10,Combak,And I'm just checking the make sure the stream is happening today.
18-07-2020T15:14:16,Roughlandin,Because nobody uses it correctly. I scored in the 99th percentile on my grammar SAT and even I barely know how to use it...
18-07-2020T15:14:18,CrRAR,semi-colon is like an authoritative pardon to have a run-on sentence
18-07-2020T15:14:24,Ordithus,Should petition that the sarcasm mark is added to English writing
18-07-2020T15:14:25,johnnytho,No don't ban because winky ;)
18-07-2020T15:14:46,Combak,"No, you use a semi-colon to join a sentence with a partial sentence; kinda like this."
18-07-2020T15:14:48,ProsePro7,Semi colons are used where a period should be but you dont want to end a sentence
18-07-2020T15:14:50,CrRAR,also useful for nested lists
18-07-2020T15:15:06,CrRAR,yeah prose
18-07-2020T15:15:08,Ordithus,they can be useful for technical writing
18-07-2020T15:15:21,AspiringNoodle,I do not agree with the idea of ending the semicolon; it is our first amendment right to speak like idiots!
18-07-2020T15:15:31,AspiringNoodle,"Or in this case, write :ptv-snicker:"
18-07-2020T15:15:33,ProsePro7,They are for technical manuals not novels
18-07-2020T15:15:33,CrRAR,haha
18-07-2020T15:16:11,CrRAR,It's like when an idea has to continue but not as fluidly as it would if it just needs a comma
18-07-2020T15:16:36,CrRAR,"sentence, you drunk; go home"
18-07-2020T15:16:38,Ordithus,And if they were separate sentences the flow is all wrong.
18-07-2020T15:16:43,Roughlandin,I do not like semi-colons; they annoy me; even when used properly; you could just use a period or a comma instead.
18-07-2020T15:16:48,AspiringNoodle,Life; death; stupidity; all are part of the eternal cycle
18-07-2020T15:16:54,Ordithus,noodle no

18-07-2020T15:17:28,Roughlandin,My grammar is getting worse just talking about grammar!
18-07-2020T15:17:55,AspiringNoodle,"But because I flipped it, all acts as the noun <3"
18-07-2020T15:18:11,CrRAR,"I agree, the stupidity usually happens BEFORE death"
18-07-2020T15:18:15,CrRAR,not AFTER
18-07-2020T15:18:29,Ordithus,sometimes the stupidity happens before life

18-07-2020T21:39:00,vevans0009,8o
18-07-2020T21:39:05,Ordithus,it's been suggested

18-07-2020T21:39:22,ToddDiesel,i think she would break the bust competition on that
18-07-2020T21:39:25,Roughlandin,Next week: Trace eating pretzels AND Keith takes his shirt off AND etc...
18-07-2020T21:39:34,Ordithus,Really?  Huh.
18-07-2020T21:39:44,Brocade,I missed a bunch of the chat

18-07-2020T21:39:58,KeefMcDerpface,Uh....
18-07-2020T21:39:58,ElvenHunter84,Has anyone actually suggested Trace eating pretzels or is that just a joke?
18-07-2020T21:40:01,BadFoMo,@beastlee99 I think a fan may have done it with a sketch.
18-07-2020T21:40:11,Roughlandin,Butts against glass is basically this chat in a nutshell
18-07-2020T21:40:17,KeefMcDerpface,lol
18-07-2020T21:40:21,unsteddyphoenix,A picture with Kat AND Flora had ZERO votes?

18-07-2020T21:40:28,beastlee99,I don't understand what that means lol
18-07-2020T21:40:46,KeefMcDerpface,Tom sketched it. A fan colored it.
18-07-2020T21:40:49,KeefMcDerpface,I think.
18-07-2020T21:40:49,Twokinds,Nothing got 0 votes
18-07-2020T21:40:55,unsteddyphoenix,AND brutus+clovis+gender change? My mind cant comprehend that
18-07-2020T21:40:57,Roughlandin,Trace eating pretzels was a suggestion that didn't win a few weeks ago. It got worked in as Laura eating a pretzel in the Gamer Laura pic
18-07-2020T21:40:59,Katfeathers,"Nani, I thought I voted for that"
18-07-2020T21:41:09,beastlee99,"Nvm, I wasn't talking about you Keef"

18-07-2020T22:58:41,Roughlandin,NEVER apologize!
18-07-2020T22:58:48,FenceEqualizer,No worries.
18-07-2020T22:58:49,Roughlandin,We should be saying sorry to YOU lol
18-07-2020T22:59:00,steelabjur,"No problem, Tom! Longstreams are fun too!"
18-07-2020T22:59:04,unsteddyphoenix,we appreciate both the length and girth of the stream
18-07-2020T22:59:08,Twokinds,I just draw slow some days
18-07-2020T22:59:09,Roughlandin,Lewd Teddy
18-07-2020T22:59:11,SpazztasticKiwi,“sorry” for not streaming
18-07-2020T22:59:14,FenceEqualizer,Also out of the few years i’ve been watching I think this is the modt i’ve seen Tom talk in chat
18-07-2020T22:59:15,unsteddyphoenix,??
18-07-2020T22:59:20,SpazztasticKiwi,“sorry” for long stream
18-07-2020T22:59:24,Roughlandin,Those were some pretty involved sketches Tom
18-07-2020T22:59:30,Twokinds,Yeah
18-07-2020T22:59:30,unsteddyphoenix,Girth obviously meaning dense in content?
18-07-2020T22:59:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom is Canadian
18-07-2020T22:59:34,Twokinds,The maddie one especially
18-07-2020T22:59:54,Roughlandin,Well at least you didn't have to draw white wolf Nat AND Keith taking off his shirt
18-07-2020T23:00:03,Ordithus,That was a good one... and needs a followup
18-07-2020T23:00:10,Ordithus,:ptv-ohmy:
18-07-2020T23:00:11,KeefMcDerpface,heh
18-07-2020T23:00:13,Twokinds,"Oh yeahm, I'm sure that'd have taken forever"
18-07-2020T23:00:16,Twokinds,It's TWO things
18-07-2020T23:00:20,Roughlandin,Hehehehe
18-07-2020T23:00:37,Roughlandin,"Hey, man. They can't all be Trace eating pretzels."
18-07-2020T23:00:46,CrimsonHelsing,"Looking forward to tomorrow evening, Tom!"
18-07-2020T23:01:00,FenceEqualizer,Was that a suggestion?
18-07-2020T23:01:02,SpazztasticKiwi,can you only see the poll on patreon or can anyone see the votea
18-07-2020T23:01:06,CrimsonHelsing,And looking forward to story updates as always
18-07-2020T23:01:07,SpazztasticKiwi,votes
18-07-2020T23:01:27,Roughlandin,Yeah Fence. That was the same week as Gamer Laura. Which is why she's eating a pretzel in the pic
18-07-2020T23:02:17,FenceEqualizer,Huh. Slightly random
18-07-2020T23:02:33,InTheLionsDen,Pole results thanks to mingun (and the incorrect zero ones have been fixed) https://mingun.github.io/twokinds-omnipoll-results/?date=2020-07-19
18-07-2020T23:02:56,Roughlandin,"Or... what was that one Tom couldn't even make sense of? ""Draw the actress commenting on the scenes from the comic""?"
18-07-2020T23:03:02,mingun,Also fill all other places.
18-07-2020T23:03:26,Roughlandin,Thanks Mingun!
18-07-2020T23:03:27,KeefMcDerpface,Flora yelling 'Show me what you got'?
18-07-2020T23:03:53,SpazztasticKiwi,we’ve had the can opener tackle before
18-07-2020T23:04:08,Ordithus,"yeah, Kat and Flora destroyed Keith"
18-07-2020T23:04:30,Roughlandin,We've basically already had Good Morning Tigress Trace
18-07-2020T23:04:59,Roughlandin,If you count the one with Tigress Trace and Flora in that loft bed thing
18-07-2020T23:05:11,FenceEqualizer,Low key want to see the kingdomhearts one
18-07-2020T23:05:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m regretting the Maeve portrait
18-07-2020T23:05:23,FenceEqualizer,See if Tom can draw enough belts and zippers
18-07-2020T23:05:28,Ordithus,don't
18-07-2020T23:05:38,SpazztasticKiwi,now we wantin to hand out portraits like oprah
18-07-2020T23:05:40,Ordithus,the Maeve portrait is adorable <3
18-07-2020T23:05:50,Ordithus,these trends happen
18-07-2020T23:05:56,FenceEqualizer,^
18-07-2020T23:06:28,Roughlandin,Lot of trends happening. Against the glass. Portrait series. Still a few Good Mornings
18-07-2020T23:06:46,Roughlandin,People like familiarity. See: The Fast and Furious series
18-07-2020T23:06:53,KeefMcDerpface,heh
18-07-2020T23:06:53,Ordithus,remember the Therie x Daniels series? That was good.  Tom had to end it haha
18-07-2020T23:07:02,KeefMcDerpface,yeah
18-07-2020T23:07:14,Roughlandin,Therie and Danels are super cute and their end was super satisfying
18-07-2020T23:07:18,FenceEqualizer,Surprise people didn’t still try to suggest more
18-07-2020T23:07:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I have another idea I might swap poor Mike out with for next time but it was liked with 54/74 votes
18-07-2020T23:07:27,SpazztasticKiwi,whichever was the actual number
18-07-2020T23:07:36,Ordithus,the omni poll has VERY different results from the stream polls
18-07-2020T23:07:52,SpazztasticKiwi,reeeeeeally
18-07-2020T23:07:53,Ordithus,mine got wrecked this week but did pretty well in the stream votes
18-07-2020T23:07:53,Roughlandin,Omni tends preeeetty fanservicey
18-07-2020T23:08:14,Ordithus,hmm yeah you would know that lol
18-07-2020T23:08:20,SpazztasticKiwi,I have a feeling one of my top ideas would’ve done alot better
18-07-2020T23:08:31,Roughlandin,What? Me? A fan of fanservice? Never!
18-07-2020T23:08:50,KeefMcDerpface,What about the service of fans?
18-07-2020T23:08:58,Roughlandin,Is that legal?
18-07-2020T23:09:09,Ordithus,That's Florence's specialty
18-07-2020T23:09:45,Roughlandin,Florence can service me any... I'm not gonna finish that sentence.
18-07-2020T23:09:46,FenceEqualizer,Have a good night all. Gonna try Ghost of Sushi out.
18-07-2020T23:09:49,Roughlandin,Night Fence
18-07-2020T23:09:54,Ordithus,g'night fence
18-07-2020T23:09:55,KeefMcDerpface,bye Fence
18-07-2020T23:10:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve also noticed I’ve had at least 6 sketches done & 5 got colored
18-07-2020T23:10:30,SpazztasticKiwi,at least 2 were Norafied
18-07-2020T23:10:32,Roughlandin,Nice. I'm sitting at 3 and 1. *Shrugs*
18-07-2020T23:10:45,Roughlandin,It's more about supporting Tom for me.
18-07-2020T23:10:50,KeefMcDerpface,Not bad records tbh.
18-07-2020T23:11:03,Ordithus,15 and 3
18-07-2020T23:11:21,Ordithus,+ 2 that were Nora'd (thanks marsh)
18-07-2020T23:11:31,Roughlandin,Noice Ord
18-07-2020T23:11:33,SpazztasticKiwi,which brings me to my question out of all that
18-07-2020T23:11:55,SpazztasticKiwi,how many more cards you got left till you’re ready to open them back up Tom
18-07-2020T23:12:07,unsteddyphoenix,https://imgur.com/a/umS19Uc
18-07-2020T23:12:08,Roughlandin,IS Tom going to open them back up?
18-07-2020T23:12:11,unsteddyphoenix,meirl
18-07-2020T23:12:20,Sclimshady,XD Teddy
18-07-2020T23:12:23,Ordithus,ha
18-07-2020T23:12:25,Roughlandin,Teddy already meming
18-07-2020T23:12:28,MarvTheHugPharaoh,You lad
18-07-2020T23:12:30,KeefMcDerpface,lol
18-07-2020T23:12:52,SpazztasticKiwi,"I saw some azuma cars maybe 2, but I know they did one for sure"
18-07-2020T23:12:53,KeefMcDerpface,"""Honey, there's a cat on the window. Honey?"""
18-07-2020T23:13:38,Roughlandin,"Though I would have prefaced the bottom part with ""Furries:"""
18-07-2020T23:14:12,KeefMcDerpface,"""They're both furries""?"
18-07-2020T23:14:26,unsteddyphoenix,Oh yeah
18-07-2020T23:14:33,Roughlandin,"No like... Furries: ""They're the same picture."""
18-07-2020T23:14:39,KeefMcDerpface,oh
18-07-2020T23:14:45,KeefMcDerpface,hahaha
18-07-2020T23:14:50,Roughlandin,XD
18-07-2020T23:14:56,SpazztasticKiwi,"I have more Maeve ideas, something to distract from the against the glass series or at least disrupt it..."
18-07-2020T23:15:06,unsteddyphoenix,Good constructive criticism
18-07-2020T23:15:14,Roughlandin,Always happy to help lol
18-07-2020T23:15:47,SpazztasticKiwi,but I might also just let Tom run with the one I gave him until patreon decides to get back from lunch break
18-07-2020T23:17:03,Roughlandin,"I really like my Brutus and Clovis magazine cover idea, but it only got like 50 votes... Debating whether to resubmit it next month or not"
18-07-2020T23:18:57,SpazztasticKiwi,flip a coin
18-07-2020T23:19:25,Twokinds,50 is around the middle of the pack.
18-07-2020T23:19:48,Roughlandin,True. I'm not complaining. 50 is still a lot.
18-07-2020T23:19:54,Twokinds,"I think that's another benifit of the Omnipoll, it makes it clear the general sentiment of ideas. Though, it's always disheartening if it's lower on the poll, I know."
18-07-2020T23:20:06,KeefMcDerpface,yeah
18-07-2020T23:20:26,Roughlandin,Oh I'm not too put out. I should have known to tailor my suggestion a little more fanservicey for Omnipoll week lol
18-07-2020T23:20:32,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah I like the data
18-07-2020T23:20:34,Twokinds,"I do actually try to pick from various places - both high, low, and middle, when choosing my picks."
18-07-2020T23:20:40,unsteddyphoenix,Rough what you gotta do
18-07-2020T23:20:52,unsteddyphoenix,Is make you mention that Clovis is female
18-07-2020T23:20:56,unsteddyphoenix,And that theyre married
18-07-2020T23:21:00,SpazztasticKiwi,find what speaks to you
18-07-2020T23:21:02,unsteddyphoenix,And like a powercouple of the year or somethin
18-07-2020T23:21:06,Twokinds,"I'll take the top 1/3, pick one, 2/3, pick one, 3/3 pick one."
18-07-2020T23:21:10,SpazztasticKiwi,nonverbally
18-07-2020T23:21:13,Twokinds,"Not that mathmatically, of course."
18-07-2020T23:21:29,Roughlandin,Pfft lol. Nice advice Teddy
18-07-2020T23:22:01,unsteddyphoenix,Trust me I am a veteran
18-07-2020T23:22:03,Sclimshady,Teddy just wants you to make his suggestion for him
18-07-2020T23:22:07,unsteddyphoenix,Im definetly
18-07-2020T23:22:09,unsteddyphoenix,Not doing that
18-07-2020T23:22:11,unsteddyphoenix,Not at all
18-07-2020T23:22:15,Roughlandin,Here we go. Modern AU Brutus and Clovis on the cover of CEOs Gone Wild magazine
18-07-2020T23:22:17,MarvTheHugPharaoh,X to doubt
18-07-2020T23:22:28,unsteddyphoenix,Ceos gone wild ahahaha
18-07-2020T23:22:38,Roughlandin,Hehehe
18-07-2020T23:23:03,KeefMcDerpface,lol
18-07-2020T23:23:15,SpazztasticKiwi,I rarely have Kat ideas
18-07-2020T23:23:18,Roughlandin,Where the Corporate Elite meet between the sheets! Thank you for reading CEOs Gone Wild!
18-07-2020T23:23:19,KeefMcDerpface,But what are they the CEOs of?
18-07-2020T23:23:29,johnnytho,ships
18-07-2020T23:23:34,SpazztasticKiwi,or anything for Mike or nat or Keith
18-07-2020T23:23:35,Roughlandin,The rival corporation to Templar Inc.
18-07-2020T23:23:57,Ordithus,half my suggestions seem to involve Mike
18-07-2020T23:24:03,SpazztasticKiwi,but I have one written down for all three rn
18-07-2020T23:24:04,KeefMcDerpface,FoxyWolf Inc. (?)
18-07-2020T23:24:12,Roughlandin,More Mike suggestions are always good
18-07-2020T23:24:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"even came up with 2 for Erilas, Mike, & co"
18-07-2020T23:24:48,Ordithus,:eyes: Erilas you say
18-07-2020T23:25:05,Roughlandin,Just write the word Erilas and your suggestion will win
18-07-2020T23:25:15,Roughlandin,Moar. Erilas.
18-07-2020T23:25:18,Roughlandin,Instant winrar
18-07-2020T23:25:24,KeefMcDerpface,Just Erilas?
18-07-2020T23:25:28,Roughlandin,Only Erilas.
18-07-2020T23:25:45,Roughlandin,...Why am I getting Doki Doki Lit Club flashbacks?
18-07-2020T23:25:45,Ordithus,Tom: be specific!
18-07-2020T23:25:51,KeefMcDerpface,"Nothing else in the suggestion. Just the word ""Erilas""."
18-07-2020T23:25:52,Ordithus,:cw0lfmare-Flip1::cw0lfmare-Flip2:
18-07-2020T23:26:00,Roughlandin,lol
18-07-2020T23:26:18,Roughlandin,Erilas eating pretzels. There.
18-07-2020T23:26:21,Roughlandin,Specific
18-07-2020T23:26:52,johnnytho,Trace has a pretzel buddy :)
18-07-2020T23:27:04,KeefMcDerpface,Erilas working in a library? Like we say she's a librarian but haven't had a sketch of her as one.
18-07-2020T23:27:07,Ordithus,"my god, if Flora saw Erilas"
18-07-2020T23:27:15,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-floAAA:
18-07-2020T23:27:15,SpazztasticKiwi,one or two thoughts I’ve had for Erilas sketches would make me lose all and complete faith in the voters if it won
18-07-2020T23:27:18,KeefMcDerpface,Flora's eyes would pop out.
18-07-2020T23:27:34,Roughlandin,Her smol baps would explode in jealous rage
18-07-2020T23:27:49,steelabjur,"Flora: ""They make them in THAT size??"""
18-07-2020T23:28:06,Jeebuus,Coming out of my hidey-hole to say that Erilas is definitely not a guaranteed win lol
18-07-2020T23:28:06,Roughlandin,@Spazz: Your first mistake was having faith in the voters.
18-07-2020T23:28:08,KeefMcDerpface,:ptv-confused: Yes?
18-07-2020T23:28:27,Roughlandin,"Flora: ""They come in pints?"""
18-07-2020T23:30:25,Roughlandin,"Hmm... I've also had a suggestion for an AU where Clovis wakes up with amnesia and becomes the protag instead of Trace, but I need to phrase it better"
18-07-2020T23:30:53,Jeebuus,Page 1 but with Clovis?
18-07-2020T23:31:23,Roughlandin,That works. Just needs a little. Idk. Spice. Something to make it pop
18-07-2020T23:31:25,KeefMcDerpface,And Flora is Brutus?
18-07-2020T23:31:42,Jeebuus,That would be neat actually.
18-07-2020T23:31:55,Roughlandin,Oooh! We're starting an AU boys! And Trace is still the evil Grant Templar!
18-07-2020T23:32:12,Roughlandin,Grand Templar. Grant is his cousin.
18-07-2020T23:32:25,Ordithus,"Clovis is pretty bad, but perhaps not as irredeemable as Trace was... though Trace did have a few crossed wires"
18-07-2020T23:32:41,SpazztasticKiwi,"Tom is Mike one to tell white lies for the sake of saving feelings or keeping a surprise but if it was to come to his skills or something he knew was wrong, would he correct a story"
18-07-2020T23:32:53,SpazztasticKiwi,"in a nutshell, is Mike honest"
18-07-2020T23:33:07,SpazztasticKiwi,this is sketch research important
18-07-2020T23:33:11,Roughlandin,He's not being very honest with himself in the comic ATM
18-07-2020T23:33:30,Roughlandin,Acting like he's okay with Evals leaving and going home
18-07-2020T23:33:41,Ordithus,"hmm he's generally an honest fella, but there was a time with Flora... lemme look"
18-07-2020T23:34:01,SpazztasticKiwi,that’s in sacrifice if his own feelings - not what I’m nudging at
18-07-2020T23:34:19,Roughlandin,I would think Mike would save someone's feelings over being completely honest. He's very empathetic.
18-07-2020T23:34:31,KeefMcDerpface,So? You're asking if Mike is honest with other people. Not himself?
18-07-2020T23:34:41,SpazztasticKiwi,generally
18-07-2020T23:34:59,Ordithus,he mostly avoids conflict
18-07-2020T23:35:06,Roughlandin,I mean acting like he's happy for Evals is saving Evals' feelings... basically
18-07-2020T23:35:14,Roughlandin,He's doing it more to keep Evals happy
18-07-2020T23:35:30,SpazztasticKiwi,"like, if it came down to agreeing to something or with something that would make him look bad or possibly make someone else look bad as a result, would he still do it"
18-07-2020T23:35:51,Roughlandin,Mike would throw himself under the bus every time
18-07-2020T23:35:54,SpazztasticKiwi,as in just embarrass them or himself
18-07-2020T23:36:09,SpazztasticKiwi,not necessarily maim or kill
18-07-2020T23:36:17,Roughlandin,He lied about what caused his scar to Evals in that one sketch.
18-07-2020T23:36:32,SpazztasticKiwi,that is the sketch that shall not be named
18-07-2020T23:36:39,SpazztasticKiwi,that sketch does not exist
18-07-2020T23:36:51,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-LauraCry:
18-07-2020T23:36:59,KeefMcDerpface,:ptv-confused: O.K.A.Y.
18-07-2020T23:37:00,Roughlandin,Eh. It's super sad but an AMAZING sketch from a lore point of view
18-07-2020T23:37:52,Ordithus,though Mike DID admit he was a girl
18-07-2020T23:37:58,Ordithus,to Nat and Kat
18-07-2020T23:38:07,SpazztasticKiwi,there is another question but it’s for the lost faith in humanity sketch
18-07-2020T23:38:19,SpazztasticKiwi,& the question itself is not one I’m keen to have to ask
18-07-2020T23:39:24,SpazztasticKiwi,but is Erilas more “blessed” than Nora or do they have the same serving of blessings
18-07-2020T23:39:45,Roughlandin,You mean in the baps department? Erilas is bigger.
18-07-2020T23:40:06,Ordithus,I think Erilas is the bobbiest
18-07-2020T23:40:28,SpazztasticKiwi,“blessed”
18-07-2020T23:40:35,Ordithus,"sorry, blessed"
18-07-2020T23:40:53,Roughlandin,Nora is a DD. Erilas is like an E at least
18-07-2020T23:41:15,KeefMcDerpface,Is there a version of Nora we should focus on or just Nora in general?
18-07-2020T23:42:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t see how Erilas doesn’t have back pain without support aside from being fictional
18-07-2020T23:42:21,Roughlandin,She's got the hips to support it
18-07-2020T23:42:28,Ordithus,fiction
18-07-2020T23:42:35,Ordithus,"like, dang"
18-07-2020T23:42:59,Roughlandin,Erilas probably has the most anime proportions of all of Tom's characters
18-07-2020T23:43:18,KeefMcDerpface,Flora made the same comment about Kat and Kat wears nothing most of the time.
18-07-2020T23:43:22,SpazztasticKiwi,"Nora, I can see being ok cause who’s to say she’s not an illusion more than physical when she transforms"
18-07-2020T23:43:35,SpazztasticKiwi,could be all smoke & mirrors
18-07-2020T23:43:37,Ordithus,hers also aren't permanent
18-07-2020T23:44:05,Roughlandin,Does Nora use illusions? Or is it more like Euchre's perfect transformation technique?
18-07-2020T23:44:13,Roughlandin,I would think the latter
18-07-2020T23:44:19,SpazztasticKiwi,“my back hurts- oh yeah” 💨 🐉
18-07-2020T23:44:21,Ordithus,both
18-07-2020T23:44:24,Roughlandin,"...Wasn't this in the ref sheet, btw?"
18-07-2020T23:44:36,SpazztasticKiwi,“all better”
18-07-2020T23:44:51,Ordithus,"Clovis is transformed, Mike was... an illusion you could feel"
18-07-2020T23:45:02,Ordithus,lol kiwi
18-07-2020T23:45:12,Roughlandin,"Also, in canon she doesn't usually transform herself into biped races"
18-07-2020T23:45:12,SpazztasticKiwi,a 3d illusion
18-07-2020T23:45:16,SpazztasticKiwi,those are rare
18-07-2020T23:45:27,Roughlandin,Dragon magic. When in doubt. Dragon magic.
18-07-2020T23:45:32,SpazztasticKiwi,~4d~
18-07-2020T23:45:33,KeefMcDerpface,heh
18-07-2020T23:45:37,Ordithus,20d
18-07-2020T23:45:38,SpazztasticKiwi,or 4DD
18-07-2020T23:45:46,Ordithus,aaand back to Erila
18-07-2020T23:45:48,Ordithus,erilas
18-07-2020T23:46:03,Roughlandin,Eh. Girl Mike looks more like a C
18-07-2020T23:46:13,Roughlandin,Though her looks are a definite A
18-07-2020T23:46:38,Roughlandin,"As are boy Mike's. Rough likey Mikey, if you haven't heard."
18-07-2020T23:47:01,Ordithus,never
18-07-2020T23:47:05,Roughlandin,XD
18-07-2020T23:48:17,Ordithus,"so back to Mike: he's timid, but seems he will speak up when it comes down to it, even if it hurts"
18-07-2020T23:48:51,KeefMcDerpface,Compare to Evals who seems to be the one to save his fur every chance he gets.
18-07-2020T23:49:12,Roughlandin,But if he'd have to lose face to save someone else's reputation. I think he'd be the one to take the fall 9 times out of 10.
18-07-2020T23:49:21,Roughlandin,"Mike, that is"
18-07-2020T23:50:09,KeefMcDerpface,So Mike is a good guy (or fox) at heart.
18-07-2020T23:50:18,Roughlandin,Mike is a best boy at heart
18-07-2020T23:50:37,Roughlandin,He's too good for this world.
18-07-2020T23:50:46,KeefMcDerpface,yeah
18-07-2020T23:50:50,SpazztasticKiwi,could throw Mike a bone & have him save Erilas from a spider
18-07-2020T23:50:53,Roughlandin,Would you like me to simp for him harder? I can.
18-07-2020T23:51:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Evals all but throwing him in the room to “volunteer”
18-07-2020T23:51:25,Ordithus,:spider:
18-07-2020T23:51:36,Roughlandin,Eh. Mike would be too scared of the spider
18-07-2020T23:51:48,Ordithus,ha I see where you're going
18-07-2020T23:51:48,Roughlandin,My boy is good but soff
18-07-2020T23:51:52,SpazztasticKiwi,“help my sister I’m totally right behind you”
18-07-2020T23:52:01,SpazztasticKiwi,door slams
18-07-2020T23:52:05,SpazztasticKiwi,lock turns
18-07-2020T23:52:11,Ordithus,okay maybe not
18-07-2020T23:52:13,KeefMcDerpface,wow
18-07-2020T23:52:24,Roughlandin,Mike trips. Falls on spider. Gets spider bite on butt. Becomes Spider-Mike.
18-07-2020T23:52:27,KeefMcDerpface,Also that is something Evals would do.
18-07-2020T23:52:49,Ordithus,"no, not really.  He's there for Mike"
18-07-2020T23:52:54,SpazztasticKiwi,he comes back to both of them hiding on top of the dresser
18-07-2020T23:53:11,Ordithus,Who is protecting who here http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/944/
18-07-2020T23:53:14,SpazztasticKiwi,turns out the spiders been a fuzz bunny the whole time
18-07-2020T23:53:19,Roughlandin,The spider turns to face Evals. Cut to all three on top of the dresser.
18-07-2020T23:53:48,KeefMcDerpface,3rd panel on that page?
18-07-2020T23:54:00,Roughlandin,Yus. Soff boy Mike. Must protec.
18-07-2020T23:54:18,Roughlandin,Gib lots of cute coyote and wolf gals
18-07-2020T23:54:26,Ordithus,"Also that page, Eric, way to finally be decent"
18-07-2020T23:54:26,KeefMcDerpface,heh
18-07-2020T23:54:53,Roughlandin,Eric is a perv but not a monster. It makes sense.
18-07-2020T23:55:05,Roughlandin,Not his brother...
18-07-2020T23:55:15,SpazztasticKiwi,"finally, after all of the cast has come to investigate where everyone’s disappeared & the dresser is sweating from the weight piled on it, Nibbly comes in and eats it"
18-07-2020T23:55:29,KeefMcDerpface,Yay!
18-07-2020T23:55:33,Ordithus,heh
18-07-2020T23:55:35,SpazztasticKiwi,twas a raisin
18-07-2020T23:55:38,Roughlandin,Nibbs' tongue lashes out like a frog
18-07-2020T23:55:41,KeefMcDerpface,Way to go Nibbly!
18-07-2020T23:55:56,Roughlandin,N O R M A L
18-07-2020T23:55:57,KeefMcDerpface,"lol, a little raisin."
18-07-2020T23:56:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I had something similar with Trace & Flora in the beginning
18-07-2020T23:56:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Trace with a Flora hat carrying on about a monster spider & the thing was a dust bunny the whole time
18-07-2020T23:57:01,Ordithus,ha I didn't notice the name of that page til now
18-07-2020T23:57:02,SpazztasticKiwi,“I’m gonna go grey early with you”
18-07-2020T23:57:14,Ordithus,that ref

18-07-2020T23:58:00,SpazztasticKiwi,something that came to mind on stream was about Adelaide giving maddie guards to watch her
18-07-2020T23:58:03,Dadrobit,How was the stream today? Completely missed it. Birthday celebrations.
18-07-2020T23:58:06,SpazztasticKiwi,armed babysitters
18-07-2020T23:58:06,KeefMcDerpface,"Also, congrats Dad for your sketch."
18-07-2020T23:58:14,Roughlandin,Very good. Lots of nice butts

18-07-2020T23:58:24,Dadrobit,Did undercover Maddie take a spot???
18-07-2020T23:58:29,Roughlandin,"Poor, poor Maddie"
18-07-2020T23:58:36,Roughlandin,"Why are you so mean to her, Dad?"
18-07-2020T23:58:37,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-maddiessparkles:*[Love this job]

18-07-2020T23:58:57,KeefMcDerpface,:birthday:
18-07-2020T23:59:10,Roughlandin,Another in the July Birthday Club
18-07-2020T23:59:22,SpazztasticKiwi,but the two assigned to her one night are discussing how they tell the king the lost her daughter/who’s going to tell her when Adelaide screams behind them “YOU LOST HER?!”
18-07-2020T23:59:27,Roughlandin,"That makes me, you, Things, Mihari, and Tom"
18-07-2020T23:59:41,Dadrobit,"(Not really, my brother is today, I'm the 22, we both celebrated today though)"
18-07-2020T23:59:51,Roughlandin,Same diff
