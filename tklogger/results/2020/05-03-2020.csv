05-03-2020T00:41:35,JojoF2415,This is the reason why I like cats

05-03-2020T14:48:48,tehbear,"WoW. I recall sitting on the bus in 2003 and overhearing the kids with DSL talking about their WoW exploits, whilst i was stuck with a 56k modem"
05-03-2020T14:49:25,tehbear,"actually, it must have been 2004, as wow was first released November 23 2004"
05-03-2020T14:53:48,tehbear,"I recall getting excited about the 3rd person Starcraft Ghost: Recon game, that was supposed to be released for the 2nd generation 3D consoles (Xbox, PS2, Gamecube)"

05-03-2020T17:54:32,AspiringNoodle,"2019 was the year of ""we're done with your mtx bs"""
05-03-2020T17:56:37,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
05-03-2020T17:56:54,AspiringNoodle,You remember Ghost Recon: Breakpoint?
05-03-2020T17:58:06,AspiringNoodle,"If not, you are forgiven, lol"
05-03-2020T17:58:40,AspiringNoodle,And what do I mean by my previous statements?
05-03-2020T17:59:06,AspiringNoodle,Bioware: Has to cancel future PvE content and go dark on comms so they can overhaul the entirety of the gameplay
05-03-2020T18:00:41,AspiringNoodle,"Blizzard: Effectively demasters Warcraft 3 with the reforged copy.  How bad is it?  Not only does the game have glaring technical issues, but they reduced the variety of animations from the original, removed key features,"
05-03-2020T18:01:34,AspiringNoodle,"make it so they own ANY custom game modes that players make (they don't want another DOTA 2 getting away), and the cherry on top, these changes apply to the ORIGINAL"
05-03-2020T18:01:52,AspiringNoodle,"That's right, the changes they made to the core framework of the remastered game have been retroactively applied to the original."
05-03-2020T18:02:31,AspiringNoodle,"(...I forgot to say that Bioware is doing that to Anthem, derp)"
05-03-2020T18:03:36,AspiringNoodle,And the latest: Ubisoft's Ghost Recon: Breakpoint crashed so hard that it forced the company to restructure itself and put off any future pve content so they can overhaul the game.
05-03-2020T18:04:02,AspiringNoodle,"Guess it's true what they say, corporate ruins everything, lmao"
05-03-2020T18:04:22,AspiringNoodle,"Also, obligatory apology for giant wall of text :ptv-uneasy:"
05-03-2020T18:07:14,AspiringNoodle,"Did I mention that Blizzard just held a Warcraft 3 tournament, and they had to revert the game back to original graphics because the reforged graphics kept causing matches to desync? xD"
05-03-2020T18:23:33,JojoF2415,I still can’t get over that cat eating spaghetti
05-03-2020T18:30:23,tehbear,my dog is a hound for pizza
05-03-2020T18:30:53,tehbear,also. ... i laughed that youre not over it :D
05-03-2020T18:33:47,tehbear,"Noodle: actually, i think i messed up by adding Recon. Think it was just called Starcraft: Ghost"
05-03-2020T18:34:30,tehbear,"it was announced in 2002, and put on indefinite hold in 2006"
05-03-2020T18:36:13,tehbear,current game im looking most forwards to is the remake of RE 3 : Nemesis

05-03-2020T21:59:27,JeremySenpai,I have tried to read books on my last two flights
05-03-2020T21:59:38,Nekonny,"oh, for your first class flight?"
05-03-2020T21:59:41,SageSaga,also no seat in front of me
05-03-2020T21:59:42,JeremySenpai,eneded up chatting to my seat buddy for the entire trip
05-03-2020T21:59:43,SageSaga,yeah
05-03-2020T21:59:50,CrRAR,that's the beat
05-03-2020T21:59:53,Nekonny,Never flown first class before
05-03-2020T21:59:59,CrRAR,*best
05-03-2020T22:00:03,Nekonny,or business for that matte
05-03-2020T22:00:08,SageSaga,it was already really expensive and the upgrade was cheap
05-03-2020T22:00:19,SageSaga,i actually still paid less than if i had gone from my closer airport
05-03-2020T22:00:21,Nekonny,ah
05-03-2020T22:00:35,KeefMcDerpface,"Well, let's hope the person behind you doesn't put their feet up."
05-03-2020T22:00:39,SageSaga,my closer airports cheapest flight was 640
05-03-2020T22:00:45,Corinthian,hey
05-03-2020T22:00:48,TraceLegacyXI,Hey everyone!

05-03-2020T22:01:15,JeremySenpai,MY EYESSSSSSS
05-03-2020T22:01:20,TraceLegacyXI,What is the topic of conversation?
05-03-2020T22:01:42,JeremySenpai,Sage Flying First Class everywhere
05-03-2020T22:01:45,KeefMcDerpface,Sage's cheap first-class flight.
05-03-2020T22:01:49,TraceLegacyXI,Lucky sage
05-03-2020T22:01:56,TraceLegacyXI,I don’t even like planes
05-03-2020T22:01:59,JeremySenpai,looking down on us who fly economy
05-03-2020T22:02:05,JeremySenpai,:ptv-laugh:
05-03-2020T22:02:13,SageSaga,i normally fly economy =_=
05-03-2020T22:02:18,TraceLegacyXI,Ok so for the majority of today I’ve been thinking
05-03-2020T22:02:25,ZRO4825,Don't do that.
05-03-2020T22:02:25,SageSaga,i dont generally have the money for first class- just got lucky on this flight
05-03-2020T22:02:26,TraceLegacyXI,And it’s been driving me crazy
05-03-2020T22:02:40,JeremySenpai,I got upgraded once
05-03-2020T22:02:40,Nekonny,Ive been saving miles for the past 2 years
05-03-2020T22:02:44,TraceLegacyXI,So can someone tell me
05-03-2020T22:02:44,JeremySenpai,seat 1f

05-03-2020T22:03:06,KeefMcDerpface,Female.
05-03-2020T22:03:06,TraceLegacyXI,I can’t remember
05-03-2020T22:03:11,TraceLegacyXI,Oh thanks
05-03-2020T22:03:11,JeremySenpai,3rd person to die if we hit the ground nose first
05-03-2020T22:03:12,Nekonny,so I am flying to japan using that
05-03-2020T22:03:12,IronHorseComics,female
05-03-2020T22:03:15,Nekonny,on first
05-03-2020T22:03:20,ZRO4825,Sounds like you need to go back and re-read the story then.
05-03-2020T22:03:22,TraceLegacyXI,Ok thanks
05-03-2020T22:03:31,PurpleLemons,:cpurplelemons-bongocat: *[Ohio]
05-03-2020T22:03:31,SageSaga,oh yeah- apparently flying first class will give me like 5x flier miles?
05-03-2020T22:03:33,TraceLegacyXI,Sorry it’s been driving me crazy forever now
05-03-2020T22:03:35,KeefMcDerpface,What ZRO said.
05-03-2020T22:03:42,JeremySenpai,Ohayoooooo Purplr

05-03-2020T22:03:53,KeefMcDerpface,Hello Purple
05-03-2020T22:03:54,ZRO4825,It's a terrible place.
05-03-2020T22:03:55,TraceLegacyXI,Trace be lookin depressed
05-03-2020T22:04:04,TraceLegacyXI,Don’t feel down my guy
05-03-2020T22:04:08,TraceLegacyXI,Have a snickers
05-03-2020T22:04:14,KeefMcDerpface,lol
05-03-2020T22:04:16,TraceLegacyXI,You’re not you when your hungry
05-03-2020T22:04:24,SageSaga,also the flight was mostly already taken up for economy- but not a single first class had been taken yet soooo- glad i did it
05-03-2020T22:04:24,TraceLegacyXI,The slogan I live by
05-03-2020T22:04:33,KeefMcDerpface,"Trace: ""What is a snickers."""
05-03-2020T22:04:39,TraceLegacyXI,Welp
05-03-2020T22:04:46,TraceLegacyXI,I’ve officially lost my mind
05-03-2020T22:05:07,TraceLegacyXI,But that probably would honestly be his answer
05-03-2020T22:05:10,TraceLegacyXI,😂
05-03-2020T22:05:37,CrRAR,Tom already got 'em all.
05-03-2020T22:05:40,Nekonny,looking for a tutorial...
05-03-2020T22:05:40,Werewing,"Well, he does have a habit of turning into a monster when he feels a bit hollow."
05-03-2020T22:05:44,KeefMcDerpface,:chocolate_bar:
05-03-2020T22:05:45,TraceLegacyXI,Wait is this after saria  died
05-03-2020T22:05:54,TraceLegacyXI,Cuz that would make sense
05-03-2020T22:05:58,KeefMcDerpface,I think so.
05-03-2020T22:06:01,TraceLegacyXI,Ok
05-03-2020T22:06:09,TraceLegacyXI,Now it’s making more sense
05-03-2020T22:06:10,BadFoMo,That's what I was thinking.
05-03-2020T22:06:19,KeefMcDerpface,"Also, :chocolate_bar: Snickers."
05-03-2020T22:06:27,TraceLegacyXI,"I mean, why would trace hang out with Nora  again?"
05-03-2020T22:06:31,TraceLegacyXI,And yes snickers
05-03-2020T22:06:37,TraceLegacyXI,The best candy
05-03-2020T22:06:40,CrRAR,Uhhhh
05-03-2020T22:06:43,CrRAR,DRAGON
05-03-2020T22:06:45,KeefMcDerpface,Because Dragons are cool?
05-03-2020T22:06:48,CrRAR,^^^
05-03-2020T22:06:49,TraceLegacyXI,Fair
05-03-2020T22:06:58,TraceLegacyXI,But I don’t knoe
05-03-2020T22:07:04,TraceLegacyXI,Nora creeps me out
05-03-2020T22:07:07,TraceLegacyXI,Big time
05-03-2020T22:07:17,KeefMcDerpface,She creeps everyone out.
05-03-2020T22:07:23,SageSaga,i would say because Trace and Nora are friends -
05-03-2020T22:07:26,TraceLegacyXI,That is a very true statement
05-03-2020T22:07:39,BadFoMo,"I'm not really a fan of Nora, too."
05-03-2020T22:07:44,Werewing,Nora isn't creepy. Just kinky.
05-03-2020T22:07:49,KeefMcDerpface,^
05-03-2020T22:07:52,TraceLegacyXI,Same difference?
05-03-2020T22:07:54,CrRAR,so much love 2nite

05-03-2020T22:08:18,TraceLegacyXI,I’m supposed to be sleeping but in reality I’m just laughing my ass off
05-03-2020T22:08:20,JeremySenpai,BRB i need to put something in ma belly

05-03-2020T22:08:53,Werewing,"Dang, that is the face of Reni who has seen Nora's shipping fanfic."
05-03-2020T22:08:59,TraceLegacyXI,Yes
05-03-2020T22:09:18,TraceLegacyXI,Very much yes
05-03-2020T22:09:21,KeefMcDerpface,Regrets I have a few.
05-03-2020T22:09:37,KeefMcDerpface,-Reni maybe
05-03-2020T22:09:39,TraceLegacyXI,What could you be regretting? You’re around us.
05-03-2020T22:09:45,TraceLegacyXI,Oh
05-03-2020T22:09:49,TraceLegacyXI,Never mind then
05-03-2020T22:10:09,ZRO4825,I regret nothing. And also everything.
05-03-2020T22:10:17,TraceLegacyXI,Words of wisdom

05-03-2020T22:11:18,TraceLegacyXI,"Therefore, I must apologize for my rather uncharacteristic outbursts of random things"
05-03-2020T22:11:30,KeefMcDerpface,Happens to the best of us.
05-03-2020T22:11:33,TraceLegacyXI,And that didn’t sound like me at all
05-03-2020T22:11:42,TraceLegacyXI,But thanks for the vote of confidence

05-03-2020T22:40:35,ZRO4825,It's not so much that. Twitch has a habit of suddenly turning around and biting artists in the ass for no real reason.

05-03-2020T22:40:45,JeremySenpai,^
