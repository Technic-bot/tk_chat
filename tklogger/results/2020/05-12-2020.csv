05-12-2020T03:20:33,Dadrobit,Legitimately it is a fantastic movie if you haven't seen it.

05-12-2020T03:21:13,CrRAR,"But yeah, super tense."
05-12-2020T03:21:16,Dadrobit,That is the modern solution yes.
05-12-2020T03:21:19,CrRAR,it was good
05-12-2020T03:22:27,CrRAR,I mean I guess I understand the shipping CO's aren't exactly in the business of naval warfare
05-12-2020T03:22:48,CrRAR,so might as well leave it to the military

05-12-2020T03:25:30,Dadrobit,"Somali piracy only started to really take off in the mid 2000's IIRC, and I remember being in school learning about how that exact capture was when the govt. finally went, ""Ok, this shit needs to stop NOW."""
05-12-2020T03:26:19,Dadrobit,"Like, previous to the '09 takeover, it was an issue, but it was mostly just kinda handwaved away kinda thing. Least if I'm remembering the times right."

05-12-2020T03:34:44,AspiringNoodle,I remember watching that film.  Really good.  Kinda sad how it ended
05-12-2020T03:35:04,CrRAR,"Yeah, it is a bit of a humanitarian paradox"
05-12-2020T03:35:13,AspiringNoodle,"But yeah... shortly after that event, major military powers started moving WARSHIPS into Somali waters, with explicit orders to sink any pirate vessels"
05-12-2020T03:35:51,CrRAR,cuz the 'pirates' are just desperate for a shot at some sort of prosperity
05-12-2020T03:35:52,AspiringNoodle,"India sank a pirate mothership a few years back, but that was the first incident in a while.  Otherwise, no real activity since"
05-12-2020T03:36:27,AspiringNoodle,South Park actually had an episode on the subject a while back
05-12-2020T03:36:40,CrRAR,"ah, that'll do it, india should have a good presence in that area"
05-12-2020T03:36:54,CrRAR,It is the Indian Ocean afterall.

05-12-2020T03:38:08,AspiringNoodle,"Iirc, somali pirates never actually killed anybody"
05-12-2020T03:38:48,AspiringNoodle,"More or less used firearms to initimidate crews into complying and handing over goods.  Like Dadro said, it's when a hostage situation happened that the hammer came down."
05-12-2020T03:41:48,CrRAR,Yeah it's tough not to feel that it's just misaligned sense of not having good ways to earn honest money.
05-12-2020T03:43:36,AspiringNoodle,Doesn't help that first world countries have more or less helped turn third world countries by dumping all our ewaste there :/

05-12-2020T14:47:59,ZapiliDver,"Normal situation in Russia: somebody stops in left lane, don't turn on any signal, and turn to the right from the left lane. Reality show ""Guess the turn""."
05-12-2020T14:48:35,Ordithus,"my favorite is when someone stops for a stop light, like it was a sign. they stop, then just immediately go."
05-12-2020T14:48:38,Ordithus,no green light
05-12-2020T14:48:59,Ordithus,"I don't mean right on red, either"
05-12-2020T14:49:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"I saw one jackass halfway run a red light, realize it & stop in the 4 way"
05-12-2020T14:49:50,SpazztasticKiwi,then back up
05-12-2020T14:50:05,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-keifacepalm:

05-12-2020T14:50:47,SpazztasticKiwi,you really REALLY wanna cause a wreck don‚Äôt you son
05-12-2020T14:52:14,ZapiliDver,Sometimes i really want to buy a freaking TANK and simply drive it.
05-12-2020T14:53:34,Ordithus,Who doesn't?
05-12-2020T14:53:36,MisterWho,In russia you cannot live without carcam....in europe you're not allowed to record with carcam.
05-12-2020T14:53:42,MisterWho,That is so stupid...
05-12-2020T14:53:45,ZapiliDver,"Ignoring rules? Driving on red light? I don't care, it's your problems, that you crashed into a tank!"

05-12-2020T14:55:28,MisterWho,"In germany a dashcam is allowed, in Austria not. Cause of mermanent recording into memory.  ..my bloodpressure is going up, i should change topic."
05-12-2020T14:56:05,MisterWho,@NezumiYuki That video with the tank sliding into the car...ooops XD
05-12-2020T14:56:07,SpazztasticKiwi,maybe I‚Äôd get a shot of that deer if I got one
05-12-2020T14:56:26,ZapiliDver,https://youtu.be/P0GQfwynpyE?t=6 - about tank problems.
05-12-2020T14:56:35,CrRAR,Spookybutt still on the run?

05-12-2020T14:57:01,CrRAR,a tank isn‚Äôt exactly covert in the woods
05-12-2020T14:57:03,NezumiYuki,"Yes MisterWho, but I believe there is another video of someone trying to skip a red light, and indeed driving into a tank as the convoy was turning a corner.   xDD"
05-12-2020T14:57:10,CrRAR,haha
05-12-2020T14:57:20,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm not the only one tracking her
05-12-2020T14:57:21,CrRAR,The sightings of spookybutt
05-12-2020T14:57:43,CrRAR,(not just a urban legend!)
05-12-2020T14:57:44,SpazztasticKiwi,and I‚Äôm not the only one policing hunters to leave her be
05-12-2020T14:58:03,SpazztasticKiwi,most are already saying they won‚Äôt touch her because it‚Äôd be bad luck
05-12-2020T14:58:24,Ordithus,plenty other deer in the woods
05-12-2020T14:59:13,CrRAR,Quite a sacred deer-reiere
05-12-2020T14:59:24,NezumiYuki,Oh yeah before I forget... Here's a just completed head sketch of Natani that I just tossed into my devArt stash. https://sta.sh/02cb5hhiwa7c
05-12-2020T14:59:39,NezumiYuki,Doggo had a bit too much noggo it seems.  >:3
05-12-2020T14:59:41,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-maddiessparkles:
05-12-2020T15:00:08,ZapiliDver,Too lewd
05-12-2020T15:00:20,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-natsducky: drunktani?
05-12-2020T15:00:38,NezumiYuki,"Now if it takes a bit of booze to get Nats drunk, I'd hate to see what a small mug of that stuff would do to Kats.  xDD"
05-12-2020T15:00:53,NezumiYuki,Eggnog Yo!
05-12-2020T15:11:36,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-floraquestion: so are the fans wholesome or thirsty this month
05-12-2020T15:14:06,NezumiYuki,Maybe a bit of both?
05-12-2020T15:14:10,NezumiYuki,But then again..
05-12-2020T15:14:14,NezumiYuki,We always are
05-12-2020T15:14:17,NezumiYuki,>:3
05-12-2020T15:15:23,NezumiYuki,I think DrunkTani and Kats should blur the line between wholesome humorous and LOOOOOD...   What do you guys think?
05-12-2020T15:15:51,NezumiYuki,Or should I straight up LOOD those two?  xDD
05-12-2020T15:16:55,Ordithus,do what you will but remember it's SFW 'round here
05-12-2020T15:17:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I wish there were a few more girls on here
05-12-2020T15:17:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm looking for a electric razor for my legs

05-12-2020T15:25:01,CrRAR,"I just know with electric razors, you really do get what you pay for."
05-12-2020T15:25:30,CrRAR,They pricier ones just always seem to get more close
05-12-2020T15:33:07,CrRAR,"My old norelco was cheaper, but not incredibly impressive, I have a brawn now that was sort of a splurge and it does much more of what you would get from a standard hand razor."
05-12-2020T15:33:41,CrRAR,Dunno about specifc models or if that would translate xD
05-12-2020T15:34:07,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve heard bikini trimmers and men‚Äôs beard shapers will be made to be extra gentle
05-12-2020T15:34:14,SpazztasticKiwi,and also shave well
05-12-2020T15:36:49,CrRAR,"The new one I have isn‚Äôt abrasive or anything, doesn‚Äôt pull, leaves more a soft result than what I had before."
05-12-2020T15:38:31,CrRAR,"I feel like nothing electric does a perfectly manual-razor job, face or otherwise"
05-12-2020T15:39:07,Roughlandin,"Afternoon, everybody!"
05-12-2020T15:39:17,SpazztasticKiwi,manual shaving my legs takes an act of congress

05-12-2020T19:29:51,Roughlandin,Best in moderation
05-12-2020T19:30:01,Ordithus,too much eggnog alone can be hard on the stomach
05-12-2020T19:30:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I knew it
05-12-2020T19:30:08,Ordithus,even without the good stuff

05-12-2020T19:30:47,Roughlandin,He logged out with his nog out
05-12-2020T19:30:47,Ordithus,a tumbler is about as much as I can handle
05-12-2020T19:30:49,CrRAR,it's like drining melty ice cream
05-12-2020T19:30:52,SpazztasticKiwi,you can have more the bigger and older you are tho right
05-12-2020T19:30:56,NezumiYuki,"It's all that sugar, milke and stuff... just too rich to handle in big amounts"

05-12-2020T19:31:42,SpazztasticKiwi,oh that sounds good

05-12-2020T19:32:44,NezumiYuki,Yea agreed Kiwi!    A thick shake with some booze on it is better than nog IMO
05-12-2020T19:32:57,falangie123,"woah im making eggnog for the first time ever tonight, what are the chances"
05-12-2020T19:32:58,ProsePro7,Eggnog is just ice cream base

05-12-2020T21:58:29,Twokinds,I never actually noticed how gigantically wide the 3090 was
