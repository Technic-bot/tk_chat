26-04-2020T14:08:49,CrimsonQuill,Torturing myself
26-04-2020T14:08:53,CrimsonQuill,With Alien Isolation
26-04-2020T14:09:08,SonOfGoku,How's your project going?
26-04-2020T14:09:15,CrimsonQuill,Almost done

26-04-2020T14:09:27,CrimsonQuill,Then make it look nice
26-04-2020T14:09:34,CrimsonQuill,"Exam is on Friday, May 15th"
26-04-2020T14:09:56,CrimsonQuill,"Hopefully the Lockdown'll have lifted by then, so that I can take a trip home for the first time in MONTHS"
26-04-2020T14:10:37,TerraTheWizard,bought it on sale?
26-04-2020T14:10:42,TerraTheWizard,it's quite the deal
26-04-2020T14:10:56,CrimsonQuill,@TerraTheWizard Yep
26-04-2020T14:11:05,CrimsonQuill,A friend helped convince me

26-04-2020T14:11:29,CrimsonQuill,I've seen Markiplier and SovietWomble's Letsplays.
26-04-2020T14:11:42,CrimsonQuill,But...playing it myself...is a HELLUVA different story!
26-04-2020T14:11:49,CrimsonQuill,Ahehehe...I'm scared....

26-04-2020T16:25:10,IronHorseComics,"well, Anthrocon is cancelled"
26-04-2020T16:25:34,CrimsonQuill,Makes sense with Covid-19
26-04-2020T16:25:49,IronHorseComics,looks like Tom got his wish
26-04-2020T16:28:28,Dadrobit,"Popped it into savings, can't wait to give it back next tax season. Maybe I can at least earn a buck or two in intrest until then.."
26-04-2020T16:28:43,CrimsonQuill,But they delayed the checks
26-04-2020T16:28:49,CrimsonQuill,Just to print that Goddam name
26-04-2020T16:30:11,CrimsonQuill,How far up his own behind is that guy?
26-04-2020T16:30:42,AspiringNoodle,"I think it's pretty clear he has some narcissistic tendencies.  That said, how long of a delay are we talking?"
26-04-2020T16:31:44,AspiringNoodle,"Also, playing Dark Souls 2, running along, minding my own business, I get staggered"
26-04-2020T16:31:58,AspiringNoodle,"I look to the side, see a dwarf shooting at me with a bow"

26-04-2020T18:41:53,RimaDraws,i knew about that a couple weeks ago
26-04-2020T18:42:20,JojoGD,I just wanted to point out
26-04-2020T18:42:28,RimaDraws,i already knew
26-04-2020T18:49:37,JojoGD,ok
26-04-2020T19:24:07,AspiringNoodle,Twitter makin me want to watch Miyazaki films right now
26-04-2020T19:25:04,AspiringNoodle,"I love how his films have this perfect balance of action, mystery, build up, world building, fleshing out characters, and overall pacing"
26-04-2020T19:29:39,CrRAR,lol I watched Kiki's Delivery Service not too long ago and then Mononoke just recently.
26-04-2020T19:31:12,CrRAR,"I dig the metaphoric symbolism mixed with the folklore, it's like decoding a layer of legend type-symbolism over more modernly set stories."
26-04-2020T19:33:07,CrRAR,"Kinda makes you realize that even though lots of themes and ideas come from old stories, they're still carry relevant messages."
26-04-2020T19:33:17,CrRAR,*they
26-04-2020T19:34:00,CrRAR,"aka, modern fairy tales I guess."
26-04-2020T19:34:07,CrRAR,haha
26-04-2020T19:46:53,SpazztasticKiwi,so they canceled weeks ago but didn’t say anything
26-04-2020T19:47:31,CrRAR,classy
26-04-2020T19:51:31,SpazztasticKiwi,I guess that’s $700 I’m getting back

26-04-2020T20:21:08,AspiringNoodle,Put my shirt on and suddenly it felt loose
26-04-2020T20:22:37,AspiringNoodle,"Also, favorite Miyazaki films: Spirited Away, Kiki's Delivery Service, Howl's Moving Castle.  After that... tough call.  They're all amazing films."
26-04-2020T20:23:09,AspiringNoodle,"I took part in Studio Ghibli Fest last year, saw so many films I hadn't before..."

26-04-2020T20:31:55,IronHorseComics,"Chattanooga, TN yes"
26-04-2020T20:34:45,CrRAR,Cat Returns was the next one I planned on checking out!
26-04-2020T20:35:07,CrRAR,Heard neat things about Howl's Moving Castle.
26-04-2020T20:35:20,CrRAR,Seems pretty imaginative from the cover art
26-04-2020T20:35:55,CrRAR,Also heard it was a pretty good commentary on war.
26-04-2020T20:37:04,CrRAR,I feel like a lot of the themes are about the consequences of over indulging in something.
26-04-2020T20:37:36,CrRAR,"Lots of pig imagery, NoFace is literally an allegory for over-consumption."
26-04-2020T20:38:10,CrRAR,Mononoke is literally about striking a balance with nature not over developing and destroying natural order.
26-04-2020T20:38:44,CrRAR,The ravages of war is a huge recurring theme.
26-04-2020T20:39:07,CrRAR,"Grave of the Fireflies is on my list, I've heard it is very sad."
26-04-2020T20:40:48,AspiringNoodle,You got a box of tissues?
26-04-2020T20:40:52,AspiringNoodle,You gonna need a box of tissues
26-04-2020T20:41:13,CrRAR,You bet I stocked up! This is the TP apocalypse after all xD
26-04-2020T20:41:25,AspiringNoodle,Miyazaki is very anti-war.  And Howl's Moving Castle is a prime example of that message.
26-04-2020T20:41:38,CrRAR,Yeah I have to see that.
26-04-2020T20:41:58,AspiringNoodle,You'll love finding out what the war's about
26-04-2020T20:42:02,AspiringNoodle,And how stupid it is xD
26-04-2020T20:42:09,CrRAR,lol
26-04-2020T20:43:32,CrRAR,Girl's Last Tour dealt in post-war fallout and survival it was a very thoughtful somber with a touch of hope for human spirit.
26-04-2020T20:44:13,CrRAR,Shortish anime series
26-04-2020T20:47:23,CrRAR,"I'm playing this story-driven game I heard of just recently called 'Night in the Woods', it's about a destitute town of animal folk that you are returning to after a while of being gone, so far the dialog is amusingly gloomy."

26-04-2020T20:48:27,CrRAR,You play a snarky cat character named Mae.

26-04-2020T20:50:02,AspiringNoodle,Also Mae is Bea
26-04-2020T20:50:07,AspiringNoodle,Wait... no...
26-04-2020T20:50:11,AspiringNoodle,Bea is Bae

26-04-2020T20:52:58,JojoGD,So I can start the game with a shiny starter
26-04-2020T20:53:11,AspiringNoodle,"When it comes to heavy plots, if you don't mind rather visual war graphics, Spec Ops: The Line is an AMAZING game"
26-04-2020T20:53:27,AspiringNoodle,"It came from a small studio back when war shooters were real big, and nobody paid it much heed"
26-04-2020T20:53:55,AspiringNoodle,"But the plot is phenominal and has a huge overall commentary not only on the mechanics of war FPS games, but on conflict itself"
26-04-2020T20:54:46,AspiringNoodle,"Perception vs reality, the gruesomeness of conflict, tough decisions in time of dire circumstance"
26-04-2020T20:54:49,AspiringNoodle,All this and more!
26-04-2020T20:55:42,AspiringNoodle,Hmmm... maybe I'll play Night in the Woods after I finish Dark Souls 2
26-04-2020T20:55:50,AspiringNoodle,Would be nice to play a stylized side-scroller

26-04-2020T22:25:18,SpazztasticKiwi,might be a runt
26-04-2020T22:26:11,SpazztasticKiwi,if it falls or gets stranded the mother likely won’t help
26-04-2020T22:26:17,SpazztasticKiwi,we need pictures
26-04-2020T22:27:30,SpazztasticKiwi,it could be in danger
26-04-2020T22:27:53,Twokinds,I'll see if I can spot it again.

26-04-2020T22:28:53,IronHorseComics,or are you one of those people who is unaffected by pollen?
26-04-2020T22:28:56,SpazztasticKiwi,"definitely at a disadvantage but even if you saved it from a fall or had to rescue it, wildlife police won’t take squirrels in almost ever"
26-04-2020T22:29:07,SpazztasticKiwi,that sounds good though
26-04-2020T22:29:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve been going to the park again on these warm days

26-04-2020T23:21:45,CrRAR,I get random unpredictable sniffles upon going outside but it’s only like 1 in like 20 times.
