26-01-2020T00:49:52,SpazztasticKiwi,"Tom, v important question"
26-01-2020T00:50:03,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
26-01-2020T00:50:04,SpazztasticKiwi,could the king pick up Thor‚Äôs hammer
26-01-2020T00:54:32,iliar,"Tom. I have a question about this gallery. How fast does it work? It works very fast for me, but the server placed in Russia so it may not work so well for you."
26-01-2020T00:54:51,Twokinds,The gallery is quite fast.
26-01-2020T00:55:04,Twokinds,Much faster than Patreon's slooow servers.
26-01-2020T00:55:11,Twokinds,As for the king and thor's hammer...
26-01-2020T00:55:12,Twokinds,Uh...
26-01-2020T00:56:07,Twokinds,I'm not sure. Basitins have a few similarities to asgardians. But I don't know if she's really qualify as 'worthy'.
26-01-2020T00:56:48,iliar,Nice. I assumed this could be a problem. But I really did not want to transfer the site to another server.
26-01-2020T00:57:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I would say so
26-01-2020T00:58:01,SpazztasticKiwi,she‚Äôs fair and honest
26-01-2020T00:58:02,Rolley,"Hay Tom, I can‚Äôt watch the last bit of the stream in recap"
26-01-2020T00:58:34,Rolley,I just got back and wanted to see Phoenix Laura
26-01-2020T01:00:56,Twokinds,True she is.
26-01-2020T01:01:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I might have a new idea then
26-01-2020T01:01:11,Twokinds,I don't know enough about Marvel to know the specifics of what 'worthy' means.
26-01-2020T01:01:31,Twokinds,Could make a good suggestion.
26-01-2020T01:01:45,SpazztasticKiwi,that‚Äôs a debate - considering there‚Äôs debate on the Thor vs Loki thing
26-01-2020T01:02:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Loki could and would obviously never lift the hammer and some say it‚Äôs because of his deeds and meatball state and hang ups with the past while others say it‚Äôs because the spell
26-01-2020T01:03:00,SpazztasticKiwi,whispered to the hammer by Odin was odins definition of worthy - a de definition Loki would never achieve
26-01-2020T01:03:39,SpazztasticKiwi,mental state
26-01-2020T01:04:10,SpazztasticKiwi,autocorrect has the accuracy of a tired toddler
26-01-2020T01:06:24,SpazztasticKiwi,"anyhow the way I see this going is Adelaide holding the hammer over her shoulder, where the audience (but not she) can see there‚Äôs a tiny ‚Äúreplica‚Äù printed on the handle bottom"
26-01-2020T01:07:00,SpazztasticKiwi,and watch the fandom simmer and debate üçø
26-01-2020T01:07:16,Kameloh,Tom you should see the pose ame is making on her stream :snail:

26-01-2020T01:16:59,iliar,"About the suggestions. I have long time had an idea to make several suggestions from the ""Question to TK charatcer"" series. But the problem with such suggestions is that they may contain spoilers."
26-01-2020T01:17:05,iliar,"Unlike you, I don‚Äôt know which questions you plan to answer in the comic. Therefore, I want to clarify. ""The question is to Nora. Why didn‚Äôt you stop the evil Trace when he organized the Keidran genocide?"""
26-01-2020T01:17:06,iliar,Is this suggestion allowed or is it a spoiler?
26-01-2020T01:18:32,iliar,And remind about https://pastebin.com/cX94ui7u
26-01-2020T01:27:17,Twokinds,I don't want suggestions like that.
26-01-2020T01:28:55,iliar,"Okay. I expected such an answer. But just in case, I wanted clarified."
26-01-2020T01:32:29,iliar,Shit. Picarto lost half of the stream record.
26-01-2020T01:34:13,BadFoMo,Dang.
26-01-2020T01:35:02,SpazztasticKiwi,‚Äúwhere‚Äôd the stream go‚Äù

26-01-2020T01:41:56,Twokinds,Aw man
26-01-2020T01:42:24,Twokinds,That's probably why someone got a message that a recording was created halfway through the stream.
26-01-2020T01:42:40,Twokinds,Bugged out somehow.
26-01-2020T01:42:58,Kameloh,yeah I remember that
26-01-2020T01:43:10,Kameloh,it's happened to me a few times already
26-01-2020T01:43:42,SpazztasticKiwi,youtube & picarto must be cousins
26-01-2020T01:44:33,iliar,"In fact, I have a reserve tool for creating records. So that is not a problem for me. Just a lot of extra work."
26-01-2020T01:57:53,SpazztasticKiwi,üõå
