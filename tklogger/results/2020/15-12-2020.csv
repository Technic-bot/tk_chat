15-12-2020T00:10:41,Dadrobit,"Oh man, so I'm just now finding out about these new Apple headphones Max or whatevers."
15-12-2020T00:11:25,Dadrobit,"$550, absolutely blows my mind..."
15-12-2020T00:12:17,Dadrobit,"For metal headphones, that don't fold, and require a bullshit proprietary case that doesn't protect anything."
15-12-2020T00:13:55,Dadrobit,A proprietary case that's required and doesn't actually protect anything may in fact be the most Apple thing Apple has ever done.
15-12-2020T00:15:42,Dadrobit,"(For those not in the know, the headphones don't have a power button/switch and require the case to actually turn off. So they'll bleed life if you don't put them in the case or lose it.)"
15-12-2020T00:28:21,SpazztasticKiwi,yeah those have been out
15-12-2020T00:32:36,CrRAR,"The case also has a battery in it, so like ya know with iphone batteries eventually"
15-12-2020T00:32:44,CrRAR,:dizzy_face:
15-12-2020T00:43:53,Dadrobit,The metal bit is also pretty dumbfounding. Metal is heavy yo. You don't want heavy headphones. Fatigue is real.
15-12-2020T00:44:49,SpazztasticKiwi,so I got a dilemma
15-12-2020T00:45:17,Dadrobit,Heaviest set of cans I have are my Shure SRH 840's and those things are just short of 320g. Can't wear em for barely more than an hour.
15-12-2020T00:45:52,Dadrobit,MAX pods are almost 400g. Can't even imagine that sitting on my skull for long periods.
15-12-2020T00:49:15,Dadrobit,Dilemma?
15-12-2020T00:50:07,SpazztasticKiwi,tomorrow - food - what get
15-12-2020T00:50:15,SpazztasticKiwi,pizza
15-12-2020T00:50:27,SpazztasticKiwi,actually garlic bread specifically
15-12-2020T00:50:43,SpazztasticKiwi,hot and bbq wings with cheese sticks
15-12-2020T00:50:50,SpazztasticKiwi,subway
15-12-2020T00:52:34,Dadrobit,Depends on the wings. Good wings are always worth the money.
15-12-2020T00:59:31,SpazztasticKiwi,theyâ€™re from work
15-12-2020T00:59:45,Dadrobit,Subway
15-12-2020T01:00:05,SpazztasticKiwi,technically not considering I know the ins and outs of them but itâ€™s $13 for 3 pounds

15-12-2020T16:51:50,SpazztasticKiwi,theyâ€™re sending me some new bombs
15-12-2020T16:52:12,SpazztasticKiwi,3 I got last shipment got slightly roughed up
15-12-2020T17:13:47,CrRAR,did they get cronched? What is their textures it like a pourous chalk-like material?
15-12-2020T17:22:58,CrRAR,"I just realized that they disabled backspace to undo autocorrect by default, why would they remove the one way to unmangle a word they probably mangled!"
15-12-2020T17:23:09,CrRAR,technology needs to chill
15-12-2020T17:23:34,CrRAR,"enough with ""useful and innovative"" new features!"

15-12-2020T17:24:54,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-laura: you'll use OUR word and you'll LIKE it
15-12-2020T17:25:02,SpazztasticKiwi,you know how some of them are in special shapes like a snowman head or snowflake or slice of pie
15-12-2020T17:25:27,CrRAR,oh no did the snowman head fall off?
15-12-2020T17:25:52,SpazztasticKiwi,my mr frost bomb was fine
15-12-2020T17:26:03,CrRAR,the more delicate ones sounds like?
15-12-2020T17:26:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"but itâ€™s that kind, with the extra details that got crumbly"
15-12-2020T17:27:11,CrRAR,ah I see
15-12-2020T17:29:54,SpazztasticKiwi,still usable but the crust got beat up in shipping https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/524825976597643265/788895337573908530/image0.jpg
15-12-2020T17:30:57,SpazztasticKiwi,I emailed because the tracking said the boxes were still in ms
15-12-2020T17:31:05,SpazztasticKiwi,but they were sitting on my bed
15-12-2020T17:32:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"but also, I had an email or two with numbers not matching my orders so I included all that plus added that these more special bombs probably could use different prep for shipping - more bubblewrap or wrap them tighter"
15-12-2020T17:37:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"Iâ€™ve had shipments arrive gritty or crumbly like that before but come on, these things are traveling from la to Alabama & theyâ€™ll roll 3 bombs in the same strip of bubblewrap for space"
15-12-2020T17:38:03,SpazztasticKiwi,"I expected theyâ€™d send replacements eventhough I said nothing about that, just the oddities in tracking and id numbers and maybe coddle the different bombs somehow"
15-12-2020T17:38:35,SpazztasticKiwi,"wasnâ€™t a problem if they didnâ€™t but, I wonâ€™t argue if they want to send me free stuff"
15-12-2020T17:41:37,CrRAR,"ah, yeah I wouldn't be surprised if they have like an outsourced fulfillment distributor that just slaps as many as they can in an order"
15-12-2020T17:42:05,CrRAR,not caring for the actual product or if it makes it
15-12-2020T17:42:08,SpazztasticKiwi,...this was my black friday order
15-12-2020T17:42:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I got a 5for5 bogo
15-12-2020T17:42:32,CrRAR,"oh, so they were packing many bombs that day"
15-12-2020T17:42:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"soooo, 10 bombs total"
15-12-2020T17:42:51,SpazztasticKiwi,I donâ€™t have a problem
15-12-2020T17:43:31,CrRAR,so many bombs musta felt like being back in 'nam

15-12-2020T17:44:25,CrRAR,also please tell me the pizza bomb isn't cheesy or anything xD
15-12-2020T17:44:52,SpazztasticKiwi,thereâ€™s no pizza bomb
15-12-2020T17:45:10,CrRAR,wait what was the triangle thing?

15-12-2020T17:48:10,SpazztasticKiwi,smells nice but I havenâ€™t used it yet
15-12-2020T17:49:36,SpazztasticKiwi,wk is like the purrrrfect for the love of pets collection that gives proceeds to the cat shelter they collaborate with
15-12-2020T17:50:07,SpazztasticKiwi,"but instead of the rings being silver, theyâ€™re black"
15-12-2020T17:50:30,SpazztasticKiwi,and the third replacement is the one of a kind snowflake bomb
15-12-2020T17:50:34,SpazztasticKiwi,because irony
15-12-2020T17:51:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"but it will be size 8 because 5, 6, 7, & 10 are sold out"
15-12-2020T17:51:58,CrRAR,I guess there ARE two snowflakes exactly alike~
15-12-2020T17:52:16,CrRAR,ah
15-12-2020T17:52:43,SpazztasticKiwi,one of a kind is just a blue version of the winter wonderland snowflake from the freshly fallen snow collection

15-12-2020T17:56:49,SpazztasticKiwi,I got a blue snowflake necklace to match the ring a few weeks ago
15-12-2020T17:57:14,CrRAR,which one of the blue set did you get?
15-12-2020T17:57:48,SpazztasticKiwi,the replacement is probably gonna have to goto someone else because the 7 is already loose on me
15-12-2020T17:57:57,SpazztasticKiwi,havenâ€™t used it yet
15-12-2020T17:58:12,SpazztasticKiwi,I know which moonchild I got
