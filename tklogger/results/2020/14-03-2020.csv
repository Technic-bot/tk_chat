14-03-2020T18:23:30,InTheLionsDen,Betamax was technically a better system but Sony wouldn't share licencing easily or cheaply so VHS won the race because it was cheaper and more available
14-03-2020T18:23:43,BlackjacksSec99,sounds familiar

14-03-2020T21:13:05,Xexanoth,@McClaw the problem with that is that Shadowrun is incredibly crunchy(rules heavy) so you really WANT that information.

14-03-2020T21:15:22,McClaw,"@Xexanoth Which means the GM needs a good copy of it behind the screen. Less efficient, but still functional."
14-03-2020T21:16:20,Xexanoth,"They basically wanted to follow the current D&D trend and bring out a new ""streamlined"" version, but their streamlining consisted of simply cutting out the rules and leaving it for people to ""houserule""."
14-03-2020T21:16:34,Xexanoth,and also didn't take time to playtest anything.
14-03-2020T21:16:34,KeefMcDerpface,wow

14-03-2020T21:42:27,ShamusTheFox,Interesting. Gateway in what sense? Her life force? Her body? Her magical talents?
14-03-2020T21:42:29,Mediawatcher,Come one maren succumb to the urge!

14-03-2020T21:43:00,Mediawatcher,I’m scared for maren in this chapter
14-03-2020T21:43:01,Dimensional,I wonder if whatever dark ritual used on Maren fails and she becomes a feline keidran or a squirrel keidran. Or body swaps with Nibbly.
14-03-2020T21:43:01,ShamusTheFox,Hmm...
14-03-2020T21:43:17,ProsePro7,Her spirit could be tied to the house by old Trace.  But why is the question
14-03-2020T21:43:18,Mediawatcher,It’s terrifying that trace would use her to bring saria back!
14-03-2020T21:43:24,Mediawatcher,What an evil monster!
14-03-2020T21:43:26,RimaDraws,idk

14-03-2020T21:44:07,ProsePro7,We know he only started to date Maren because she looked like Saria and he planed to use her as a vessel

14-03-2020T21:44:41,CrRAR,haha
14-03-2020T21:44:51,ProsePro7,But Saria's spirit has interfered before so I wonder if she still can or if it is beyond her now

14-03-2020T21:45:25,Thereddragon525,Agreed crimson

14-03-2020T21:45:27,Mediawatcher,Through a ghost of sorts
14-03-2020T21:45:34,ProsePro7,Rose probably allowed Trace to tie her soul to the house so that she could help with Saria's resurrection

14-03-2020T23:26:16,Ordithus,night Rough
14-03-2020T23:27:21,unsteddyphoenix,Tragic
14-03-2020T23:27:39,ProsePro7,Night all see ya next time.  Heres to a victorious suggestion
14-03-2020T23:27:56,Ordithus,"no smexy Evals, but good stream"
14-03-2020T23:27:57,FloofyCat,Which was yours?
14-03-2020T23:36:47,Twokinds,Still wondering if Comic-Con or Anthrocon will be a-go this year
14-03-2020T23:37:03,SpazztasticKiwi,y anthro
14-03-2020T23:37:31,SpazztasticKiwi,California is suppose to be closing their borders sometime
14-03-2020T23:37:39,SpazztasticKiwi,or at least discussing it
14-03-2020T23:37:50,Sclimshady,"No,  I cannot be trapped in here"
14-03-2020T23:37:57,Sclimshady,Let me out!
14-03-2020T23:38:08,Ordithus,When are those cons?
14-03-2020T23:38:13,SpazztasticKiwi,I might cancel anthro myself
14-03-2020T23:38:20,Twokinds,july
14-03-2020T23:38:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I figured you were already goin Tom
14-03-2020T23:38:34,Ordithus,Maybe?  Hope things are calmer by then
14-03-2020T23:38:38,SpazztasticKiwi,they seem to like you there
14-03-2020T23:39:08,Ordithus,"If it's still chaos by then, well, shit"
14-03-2020T23:39:15,SpazztasticKiwi,seems people are half and half - it’s either getting worse by then or better/blown over
14-03-2020T23:40:09,SpazztasticKiwi,"if it was possible to simply calm everything down, more may get done"
14-03-2020T23:40:18,KeefMcDerpface,'
14-03-2020T23:40:25,SpazztasticKiwi,but isn’t it too late to try booking for anthro by now
14-03-2020T23:41:41,SpazztasticKiwi,"oh, but warmer weather may also either help it spread and grow or kill it"
14-03-2020T23:42:09,Twokinds,"I could see them giving the all clear, everyone starts travelling again, and there's suddenly another outbreak."
14-03-2020T23:42:19,SpazztasticKiwi,yeah
14-03-2020T23:42:44,SpazztasticKiwi,it’d be best if people could get a grip for five minutes
14-03-2020T23:43:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"they’re saying being clean is best and I believe it - be clean and reasonable, don’t be running around bars and parties because it’s cheaper"
14-03-2020T23:43:59,Ordithus,I do wonder if long term this will gie us all better habits
14-03-2020T23:44:07,SpazztasticKiwi,probably not
14-03-2020T23:44:11,SpazztasticKiwi,this is the human race
14-03-2020T23:44:29,Ordithus,"yeah, but look back to middle ages"
14-03-2020T23:44:57,KeefMcDerpface,The Black Plague.
14-03-2020T23:45:10,SpazztasticKiwi,it might help spread awareness of how illness can spread without basic common sense
14-03-2020T23:45:24,AspiringNoodle,^ Also poke holes in current economic systems c:
14-03-2020T23:45:36,Ordithus,"and maybe, just maybe, people will learn that tp does not need to be hoarded"
14-03-2020T23:45:44,AspiringNoodle,^^^^^^^
14-03-2020T23:45:45,AspiringNoodle,IT
14-03-2020T23:45:47,Ordithus,oh who am I kidding
14-03-2020T23:46:02,AspiringNoodle,IT'S A RESPIRATORY INFECTION PEOPLE. YOU ARE NOT. GOING. TO. GET. EXPLOSIVE DIARRHEA.
14-03-2020T23:46:11,SpazztasticKiwi,"it’s taught to wash hands before eating, after the bathroom, when being somewhere/touching something not regularly sanitized"
14-03-2020T23:46:56,SpazztasticKiwi,"everyone’s guilty of maybe forgetting once or twice but we’re not the ones that often suffer, it’s the ones that get the germs we had - kids, the old, the sickly"
14-03-2020T23:47:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"this, it spreads, sickness can happen/mutate"
14-03-2020T23:47:31,SpazztasticKiwi,thus
14-03-2020T23:49:00,SpazztasticKiwi,"my only hesitation to go is I don’t really know the place, and i figured I’d pick up some merch"
14-03-2020T23:49:59,SpazztasticKiwi,"but if that’s not gonna be there, and the hotel I got might close, actually pennsylvania might close as there’s whispers of states closing all their borders,"
14-03-2020T23:50:30,SpazztasticKiwi,and work may not even approve my vacation time because it’s over the fourth of july which is “an event day”
14-03-2020T23:51:18,AspiringNoodle,You live in PA?
14-03-2020T23:51:46,AspiringNoodle,"Also, retail being open on federal holidays is stupid in general, and shame on people who shop on those days"
14-03-2020T23:52:08,AspiringNoodle,The obvious exceptions being vital services :P
14-03-2020T23:52:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"if that happens, I’ll not be able to do anything for vacation during that time - but I have to wait for my “application” to go through pending and say approved or not"
14-03-2020T23:52:49,SpazztasticKiwi,2020 was ok for me until after the first week because this ain’t even all the shite I’ve dealt with
14-03-2020T23:53:42,Ordithus,"I started 2020 with the worst cold ever, was death"
14-03-2020T23:54:59,AspiringNoodle,"My last week of work included progressively worsening cough (only got to mild), moderate nausea on friday that stuck around well into yesterday, and 2 separate nosebleeds out of the blue on different days :D"
