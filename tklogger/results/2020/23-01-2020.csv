23-01-2020T00:00:55,AspiringNoodle,Why couldn't I have been born in Japan? :ptv-whiny:
23-01-2020T00:07:58,SonOfGoku,Japan looks pretty interesting
23-01-2020T00:08:19,AspiringNoodle,Why Japan is amazing and other first world nations should feel garbage: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YutQuKMp3w
23-01-2020T00:08:50,AspiringNoodle,Personal favorites are: Person leaving a forgotten shopping bag by a tree for when the owner comes back looking for it
23-01-2020T00:09:10,AspiringNoodle,Unmanned grocery store where they trust you to put money in the jar for anything you take
23-01-2020T00:10:13,AspiringNoodle,Orderly lines at the subway while waiting for a train and going up the up-side of the stairway are also really good
23-01-2020T00:12:42,AspiringNoodle,SHIRT CUBE!!!: https://youtu.be/4YutQuKMp3w?t=552
23-01-2020T00:14:07,AspiringNoodle,Oh yeah... I forgot the time a train company apologized to its customers by leaving 20 seconds EARLY
23-01-2020T00:14:13,AspiringNoodle,for leaving*
23-01-2020T00:39:15,SonOfGoku,I was surprised that you had to prove to the police that you had space to park a car before buying one

23-01-2020T21:30:03,Nekonny,but not completely
23-01-2020T21:30:13,Nekonny,the nausea lasted a couple of hours
23-01-2020T21:30:45,SageSaga,well yeah- but thats a pretty big sign of CO2 poisoning
23-01-2020T21:31:04,SageSaga,what kinda heating do you have?
23-01-2020T21:31:51,Nekonny,thats the thing; it's eletric
23-01-2020T21:31:59,Nekonny,but the symptoms were the same
23-01-2020T21:32:09,maku450,hmm
23-01-2020T21:32:13,maku450,gas leak?
23-01-2020T21:32:21,Nekonny,no gas
23-01-2020T21:33:08,SageSaga,doesnt central heating still generate co2?
23-01-2020T21:33:10,Nekonny,I thought perhaps something in the system burning off dust and other elements that acumulated over the year
23-01-2020T21:33:19,Nekonny,im not sure
23-01-2020T21:33:25,Nekonny,wouldn't it just be CO?
23-01-2020T21:34:11,SageSaga,yeah i just keep typing it CO2 because its habit
23-01-2020T21:35:33,SageSaga,i probably wouldnt keep making that mistake if i had gotten to take Chemistry
23-01-2020T21:36:02,SageSaga,thats one class i wish i hadnt missed out on- lots i never learned there
23-01-2020T21:36:45,AnuSekaniArt,It's mostly all I do XD
23-01-2020T21:36:49,AnuSekaniArt,Am a chemical engineer lol
23-01-2020T21:36:51,SageSaga,but our high school let us pick either Physics or Chemistry and then you could take one as an elective
23-01-2020T21:36:57,ZRO4825,I ended up dropping Chemistry because the teacher for it at my school was a prick <_<;
23-01-2020T21:38:19,maku450,chem is pretty fun
23-01-2020T21:38:32,maku450,I enjoyed it a lot

23-01-2020T21:38:41,maku450,but now I'm in physics which is pretty :UUU
23-01-2020T21:38:59,SageSaga,i did Physics and then for an elective I took Electronics
23-01-2020T21:39:09,SageSaga,so i missed out on Chem
23-01-2020T21:39:21,AnuSekaniArt,I wound up skipping physics in high school lol
23-01-2020T21:39:31,AnuSekaniArt,I was the nutcase that went for 2 years of Chemisty XD

23-01-2020T22:51:53,CrimsonHelsing,"I think he's referring to the writer for Doctor Who as of late, Media"
23-01-2020T22:51:54,Nekonny,heya kame!

23-01-2020T22:52:17,146Time,"Steven Moffat is a well known BBC writer and showrunner who is famous for ""Plot is just cliffhanger misspelled"""

23-01-2020T22:53:04,KeefMcDerpface,So cliffhanger is plot misspelled?
23-01-2020T22:53:23,CrRAR,:thinking:
23-01-2020T22:53:37,146Time,"@mediawatcher 16 years media. 16 years. I don't think it's a question of if, it's a question of ""how long"""
23-01-2020T22:53:38,CrRAR,They do... both have repeating consonants.
23-01-2020T22:53:46,CrimsonHelsing,"and I dunno about you guys, but I for one rather enjoy the episodes and seasons that Moffat wrote"
23-01-2020T22:53:52,Rolley,hi guys. sorry i'm late. glad to see tom is well enough to go live
23-01-2020T22:53:53,Inscrutable,Same tho
23-01-2020T22:54:02,KeefMcDerpface,Hello Rolley.
23-01-2020T22:54:09,146Time,"He wrote some good episodes, but honestly I'm with Hbomberguy when it comes to his showrunning as a whole"

23-01-2020T22:54:41,Mediawatcher,I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôll take that long
23-01-2020T22:54:59,CrimsonHelsing,agreed
23-01-2020T22:55:19,KeefMcDerpface,"Ok, are we talking about Tom, Game of Thrones, or what?"
23-01-2020T22:55:33,KeefMcDerpface,We're jumping all over the place here.
23-01-2020T22:55:45,Mediawatcher,I though we were talking about tom
23-01-2020T22:55:54,Nekonny,hum
23-01-2020T22:55:54,KeefMcDerpface,If you say so.
23-01-2020T22:55:56,Nekonny,hungry
23-01-2020T22:55:59,Tharkis,catnip ! we're talking about Royal brand Catnip !

23-01-2020T22:56:25,Mediawatcher,Honestly at this point what aren‚Äôt we talking about?
23-01-2020T22:56:27,KeefMcDerpface,We're talking about everything.
23-01-2020T22:56:34,146Time,"@media He's *taken* that long. Twokinds says right at the top, 16 years and going!"
23-01-2020T22:56:40,KeefMcDerpface,And nothing.
23-01-2020T22:57:31,Mediawatcher,"Yeah but like he said sythe and maren have only been a recent thing as of late, im sure marens disappearance won‚Äôt take too long to resolve"
23-01-2020T22:57:46,Mediawatcher,"I‚Äôm willing to wait, it‚Äôll be worth it"
23-01-2020T22:57:58,Mediawatcher,Also like I said I‚Äôm more of a recent viewer of the comic
23-01-2020T22:57:59,Nekonny,What colors should I use for the catnip packaging @tharkis ?
23-01-2020T22:58:10,146Time,"And that's fine, it's not maren and sythe that's the problem, so much as this is dangling relationship #4"
23-01-2020T22:58:33,KeefMcDerpface,"And also, where's Nibs in all of this?"
23-01-2020T22:58:34,146Time,The last time we got a conclusive character arc was with *daniels*
23-01-2020T22:58:49,146Time,Anyone remember Daniels? Who got an actual complete character arc?
23-01-2020T22:58:53,Werewing,Nope.
23-01-2020T22:58:54,Mediawatcher,"Tom will do what he wants, it‚Äôs his comic after all"
23-01-2020T22:59:11,146Time,"I know, and I can be aggrivated with it, if I want."
23-01-2020T22:59:14,Werewing,I have no idea who daniel's is off the top of my head. I think Nora's Arc might be done-ish though.
23-01-2020T22:59:17,Mediawatcher,True
23-01-2020T22:59:33,Mediawatcher,I‚Äôm a little bugged too but eh what can we do?
23-01-2020T22:59:48,Tharkis,"@Nekonny hrm, no opinon really, i dont think i've ever bought catnip in a package that wasnt clear, so umm, tan? like a potato chip bag?"
23-01-2020T22:59:50,KeefMcDerpface,Daniels the guy who had a baby with the tiger who's name I can't spell.
23-01-2020T22:59:50,Rolley,sad for Nora
23-01-2020T22:59:51,146Time,"We can complain. As members of the internet, we can complain."
23-01-2020T23:00:08,Mediawatcher,I‚Äôm wondering how long Nora is gonna be napping for
23-01-2020T23:00:13,SageSaga,yeah but we look like bags of dicks when we do
23-01-2020T23:00:20,Rolley,"""a long time"""
23-01-2020T23:00:20,CrRAR,nappy nana Nora
23-01-2020T23:00:23,SageSaga,so its our decision to be dickbags
23-01-2020T23:00:27,Mediawatcher,Heh
23-01-2020T23:00:30,UltraFennec,And maybe the stream chat for drawing one of the comic pages is *not* actually the right or best place to be submitting serious criticism of a work?
23-01-2020T23:00:43,Mediawatcher,That‚Äôs exactly what I was thinking
23-01-2020T23:00:49,Mediawatcher,Not the right place for it
23-01-2020T23:00:58,BadFoMo,Back. @KeefMcDerpface Tharie Sevan.
23-01-2020T23:01:11,TheSexyBeast,^ not a dickbag
23-01-2020T23:01:12,KeefMcDerpface,There was a last name?
23-01-2020T23:01:12,Mediawatcher,I‚Äôm happy for Daniel and therie
23-01-2020T23:01:21,SageSaga,i think the chats the perfect place for legitimate criticism - but i havent seen any of that so far
23-01-2020T23:01:31,CrRAR,:fire:
23-01-2020T23:01:45,BadFoMo,I think so; alshou that might not be how it's spelled.
23-01-2020T23:01:45,146Time,What would be legitimate criticism then?
23-01-2020T23:02:14,BadFoMo,*althought
23-01-2020T23:02:24,SageSaga,"""In that 14th panel the eyes are a bit far apart or they appear to be looking the wrong way"" would be legit if that were the case"
23-01-2020T23:02:25,Werewing,I think that webcomics are a bit too boxy as of late. Is that legit?
23-01-2020T23:02:41,Rolley,a little
23-01-2020T23:02:41,CrRAR,:gift:
23-01-2020T23:02:57,Twokinds,Calm down

23-01-2020T23:03:51,Werewing,I am personally hedging my bets that this resolves as all being set up for the Pizza Man's return to rule the world as a just emperor.
23-01-2020T23:03:57,RimaDraws,who the heck you calling a peasant?
23-01-2020T23:04:04,ZRO4825,Tharkis is just hoping Nora hits him first with the shenanigans. :P

23-01-2020T23:05:01,IronHorseComics,in fact I've only been dividing secret project pages
23-01-2020T23:05:10,IronHorseComics,howdy Zumi
23-01-2020T23:05:29,Mediawatcher,Pretty crazy to see how much toms art has improved since the beginning
23-01-2020T23:05:31,IronHorseComics,so far I have 47 pages
23-01-2020T23:05:39,IronHorseComics,and a lot more to go
23-01-2020T23:06:34,Werewing,"Well, Cats can never eat/sniff just one bit of catnip."
23-01-2020T23:07:00,Werewing,So it makes sense Lays would get in the nip biz.
23-01-2020T23:07:00,NezumiYuki,"Seeing Tom improve with every page is like seeing Garfield go from round thing, into the adorable lasagna eating feline he is now.   Big improvements over time!"
23-01-2020T23:07:06,Mediawatcher,"I can kind of guess what‚Äôs happening, the magic thinks maren is saria"

23-01-2020T23:08:34,Nekonny,I think the character artwork for this page is done
