02-02-2020T00:00:03,AspiringNoodle,"WoW has a grindy achievement, lmao"
02-02-2020T00:00:10,SpazztasticKiwi,and another favorite: “you have a baby crying get your rear out of bed nothatdoesntmeanthecomputer”
02-02-2020T00:00:16,AspiringNoodle,It's a feat of strength that you need to learn about through other players or through websites :P
02-02-2020T00:00:39,KeefMcDerpface,Now that's bs.
02-02-2020T00:00:40,AspiringNoodle,"It's called ""Insane in the Membrane"""
02-02-2020T00:00:55,KeefMcDerpface,Name checks out.
02-02-2020T00:01:04,AspiringNoodle,"It's not hard to complete, just takes a REALLY long time"
02-02-2020T00:02:03,KeefMcDerpface,Longer than watching One Piece to the latest episode?
02-02-2020T00:03:18,AspiringNoodle,"Get Honored with the Bloodsail Buccaneers.  And get Exalted with Ravenholdt, Booty Bay, Gadgetzan, Ratchet, Everlook, and the Darkmoon Faire"
02-02-2020T00:04:03,KeefMcDerpface,So One Piece is still longer?
02-02-2020T00:04:09,AspiringNoodle,Not exactly
02-02-2020T00:05:00,AspiringNoodle,Here's a link to WoW's rep system
02-02-2020T00:05:23,AspiringNoodle,0 rep (neither liked or hated) is right between Neutral / Unfriendly: https://wow.gamepedia.com/Reputation
02-02-2020T00:05:37,JojoF2415,I’ve been waiting about 3 years for 2.2 in gd
02-02-2020T00:05:57,AspiringNoodle,Darkmoon Faire will take a while because it happens once a month
02-02-2020T00:06:21,CrRAR,:owl:
02-02-2020T00:06:28,AspiringNoodle,It happens the first Sunday of every month and lasts 1 week
02-02-2020T00:06:48,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-laura: hi CrRAR
02-02-2020T00:07:06,KeefMcDerpface,One week isn't bad unless you're really busy.
02-02-2020T00:07:06,AspiringNoodle,"Ravenholdt is an old unfinished rep from Vanilla, the only way to get rep with it is to farm Syndicate NPCs in older zones"
02-02-2020T00:07:19,AspiringNoodle,You'll get about 5 rep or so per kill
02-02-2020T00:07:21,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-keithdotdotdot:*[h-hi]
02-02-2020T00:07:22,Ordithus,we don't go to ravenholdt
02-02-2020T00:07:31,KeefMcDerpface,Hello CrRAR
02-02-2020T00:07:39,CrRAR,ello
02-02-2020T00:08:36,AspiringNoodle,"And finally, getting honored with the Buccaneers and the 4 reps known as the ""Steamwheedle Cartel"""
02-02-2020T00:09:10,AspiringNoodle,Completing a single quest for Booty Bay (which most people have probably done before starting this achievement) instantly makes you hated with the Buccaneers
02-02-2020T00:09:42,AspiringNoodle,"The only way to get rep with them is to kill guards in Booty Bay.  These guys are designed as anti-PvP bouncers, so they hit hard and take a while to kill."
02-02-2020T00:10:10,AspiringNoodle,They give 25 rep per kill.  You gotta do this until you hit honored with the pirates
02-02-2020T00:10:44,AspiringNoodle,You will save yourself a lot of time by using a character who hasn't touched the cartel reps
02-02-2020T00:10:54,KeefMcDerpface,All I'm hearing is BS everywhere.
02-02-2020T00:10:58,AspiringNoodle,"And when you finally hit honored with the pirates, you gotta start killing THEM :D"
02-02-2020T00:11:24,AspiringNoodle,"And earn enough rep to get Exalted with the entire Cartel, which probably has you at 35,999 / 36,000 hated rep"
02-02-2020T00:11:31,KeefMcDerpface,"""Friendship"" = ""Finish Him"""
02-02-2020T00:11:53,AspiringNoodle,"But yeah, the entire point of the achievement is that you'd have to be insane to attempt the amount of grind necessary"
02-02-2020T00:12:13,AspiringNoodle,Which is also why it's a Feat of Strength and isn't listed unless you manage to earn it
02-02-2020T00:13:06,KeefMcDerpface,:ptv-nope: < You after the whole ordeal.
02-02-2020T00:13:25,Ordithus,feat of dumb
02-02-2020T00:13:36,AspiringNoodle,It's kind of like these essence achievements this expansion
02-02-2020T00:13:43,AspiringNoodle,I'm not sure if I'm ever going to return to raiding in WoW
02-02-2020T00:13:45,JojoF2415,81% decent lol
02-02-2020T00:14:09,AspiringNoodle,"Depending on your guild, it's basically signing up for 4 - 9 hours of gameplay a week"
02-02-2020T00:14:43,AspiringNoodle,But this one essence ability you can earn requires you to get these items from the final boss of a wing in the Eternal Palace raid
02-02-2020T00:14:58,AspiringNoodle,"It takes 9 items for rank 1, 18 for rank 2, and 36 for rank 3"
02-02-2020T00:15:07,AspiringNoodle,There are 3 bosses total that drop them per week
02-02-2020T00:15:32,AspiringNoodle,"If you do solely LFR, it will take you 21 weeks to get all 3 ranks. 3 for 1, 6 for 2, and 12 for 3."
02-02-2020T00:16:19,KeefMcDerpface,And I though NieR: Automata on the hardest difficultly was bad.
02-02-2020T00:16:24,Ordithus,y u play gaem
02-02-2020T00:16:29,Ordithus,not fun sound
02-02-2020T00:16:36,AspiringNoodle,"BUT, if you raid on anything else, it goes much faster"
02-02-2020T00:16:49,AspiringNoodle,Normal will net you 3 items per boss :D
02-02-2020T00:16:55,AspiringNoodle,Heroic 7 per
02-02-2020T00:16:58,AspiringNoodle,And mythic 12 per
02-02-2020T00:17:12,AspiringNoodle,"But for most people, Heroic will be the highest they go"
02-02-2020T00:18:06,AspiringNoodle,"Assuming you full clear the raid every week, you can get 21 items per week"
02-02-2020T00:18:13,JojoF2415,30% Ultra Paracosm
02-02-2020T00:18:41,AspiringNoodle,It takes 63 items to achieve rank 3.  So it will take 3 weeks to get that
02-02-2020T00:18:57,KeefMcDerpface,"In short, I'm too old for this bs. And I'm 19."
02-02-2020T00:19:12,AspiringNoodle,"If you have extra traits for other specializations, they will only require 1/3 the items once you max the first"
02-02-2020T00:19:25,JojoF2415,33% Ultra Paracosm
02-02-2020T00:19:26,AspiringNoodle,So it goes down to 21 for each additional rank 3.  AKA 1 more week per
02-02-2020T00:19:57,AspiringNoodle,But like I said
02-02-2020T00:20:12,AspiringNoodle,To do anything above LFR requires a committment to a large group of people :/
02-02-2020T00:20:17,Ordithus,"so... uh... you do have fun with wow, right?"
02-02-2020T00:20:41,AspiringNoodle,"Oh, definitely.  I'm just finding that my priorities are switching :D"
02-02-2020T00:21:07,JojoF2415,Mokey show
02-02-2020T00:21:38,AspiringNoodle,Just pointing out that the game has gotten super grindy
02-02-2020T00:21:53,AspiringNoodle,"At least, relative to me now that I don't raid"
02-02-2020T00:22:35,AspiringNoodle,You know how we have streams on Friday / Sunday at set times?
02-02-2020T00:22:48,KeefMcDerpface,Yes?
02-02-2020T00:22:48,Ordithus,ya
02-02-2020T00:23:20,AspiringNoodle,"Raiding more or less is that. A good example would be a guild raiding Friday, Saturday, and maybe Sunday from 8 - 11, 11 - 2, 10 - 12, etc"
02-02-2020T00:23:31,Ordithus,oh I know
02-02-2020T00:23:41,AspiringNoodle,Wash rinse repeat.  Huge time committment
02-02-2020T00:24:05,KeefMcDerpface,Morning to night or night to morning?
02-02-2020T00:24:08,AspiringNoodle,"You could always try using the LFG tool to do dungeons, but you'll spend a lot of time trying to get into a group, and success isn't guaranteed"
02-02-2020T00:24:18,AspiringNoodle,Typically at night
02-02-2020T00:24:26,AspiringNoodle,Very few guilds raid in the morning
02-02-2020T00:25:57,KeefMcDerpface,"11 - 2 seems extreme, but the other two time slots seem alright."
02-02-2020T00:26:16,AspiringNoodle,"Hehe, that's a time I used to raid"
02-02-2020T00:26:23,AspiringNoodle,I'm a bit of a night owl ;)
02-02-2020T00:26:46,KeefMcDerpface,Same but I have standards.
02-02-2020T00:27:01,AspiringNoodle,"Sadly, I don't want to do 11 - 2, or 12 - 3"
02-02-2020T00:27:03,KeefMcDerpface,Midnight is when I call it.
02-02-2020T00:27:28,AspiringNoodle,"The latter is too close to when I sleep.  11 - 2 would require me to book it out of work when my shift ends, eat quickly, and then spend most of the rest of my night doing that raid"
02-02-2020T00:27:58,AspiringNoodle,"And raiding CAN be fun, but if you get tired of it, you gotta decide whether or not you want to keep doing it :/"
02-02-2020T00:28:20,AspiringNoodle,"Skip out too much, and your group will start looking for a replacement"
02-02-2020T00:29:06,AspiringNoodle,"Luckily, there's plenty to do in WoW!"
02-02-2020T00:29:23,KeefMcDerpface,And then you forget everything or something changes where you have to relearn the controls.
02-02-2020T00:29:32,AspiringNoodle,"LFR let's you experience a very watered down version of raids, experience the story"
02-02-2020T00:30:28,AspiringNoodle,"TBH, it's not necessarily a bad thing that some things are so grindy"
02-02-2020T00:30:49,AspiringNoodle,"IF all you play is WoW, and you've got the free time you're willing to burn, it's like any other time sink game"
02-02-2020T00:31:00,KeefMcDerpface,true
02-02-2020T00:31:17,KeefMcDerpface,But some games do it better than others.
02-02-2020T00:31:30,AspiringNoodle,"Also, WoW is NOT a game for completionists.  A lot of achievements require serious committments to certain aspects of gameplay"
02-02-2020T00:31:47,AspiringNoodle,"For example, you're not likely to be a Mythic raider while at the same time a top-rated PvPer"
02-02-2020T00:32:17,AspiringNoodle,Not unless you stream or create WoW content and it's your job
02-02-2020T00:33:15,KeefMcDerpface,"""My sanity has gone done."""
02-02-2020T00:33:32,AspiringNoodle,The game will probably be less grindy next expansion
02-02-2020T00:33:44,KeefMcDerpface,We can only hope.
02-02-2020T00:33:54,AspiringNoodle,They're done with artifact systems after this expansion.  They're dialing back RNG on gear drops
02-02-2020T00:34:43,AspiringNoodle,Part of the reason I'm dialing back (or trying to) my WoW playtime is that I want to play other games
02-02-2020T00:35:13,AspiringNoodle,Also want to practice art :P
02-02-2020T00:36:15,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d like to know what sign I gave any kind of algorithm that I need valentines ideas

02-02-2020T21:17:47,AspiringNoodle,"Not only may there be contract violations since they won't be finishing the dub, but from what I understand, a lot of countries have laws where you can't buy something with the intention of doing nothing with it"
02-02-2020T21:18:10,AspiringNoodle,"So if they don't release the rights or sell them off immediately, they could run into some legal trouble"

02-02-2020T21:20:52,AspiringNoodle,Makes me wonder if Funi actually knew wha they were getting into.  Or if the anime is going way further than the manga
02-02-2020T21:21:02,AspiringNoodle,Because it seems like this series is going straight Hentai xD
02-02-2020T21:21:13,CrRAR,"Well, if anything, it worked to publicize it."

02-02-2020T21:24:14,AspiringNoodle,"That reminds me, that's the big thing"

02-02-2020T23:13:07,AspiringNoodle,Good
02-02-2020T23:13:15,RimaDraws,hm
02-02-2020T23:13:15,JojoF2415,Finally my sketch is done after 4 days
02-02-2020T23:13:16,AspiringNoodle,Then the cop car over there doesn't need to take you away :ptv-hearts:
02-02-2020T23:13:21,RimaDraws,...
02-02-2020T23:13:26,RimaDraws,this wasn't my fault...
02-02-2020T23:13:58,AspiringNoodle,If you want to be REALLY weird
02-02-2020T23:14:02,AspiringNoodle,Make a squirrel plushie
02-02-2020T23:14:05,AspiringNoodle,But make it super realistic
02-02-2020T23:14:08,AspiringNoodle,And so it moves
02-02-2020T23:14:18,JojoF2415,In my experience the longer I take in my drawing the better it looks
02-02-2020T23:14:19,AspiringNoodle,And... I think it's just a squirrel with a pink bow tied on...
02-02-2020T23:14:29,CrRAR,lol
02-02-2020T23:14:38,CrRAR,just a live squirrel
02-02-2020T23:14:45,AspiringNoodle,WITH a pink bow
02-02-2020T23:14:47,AspiringNoodle,And it's a lady
02-02-2020T23:14:56,AspiringNoodle,And its name is Mrs. Nibbly :ptv-excited:
02-02-2020T23:15:07,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-eyeroll:
02-02-2020T23:15:24,JojoF2415,I tried drawing a squirrel in art class but didn’t due to time constraints. I also had a bad fever the next day
02-02-2020T23:15:29,RimaDraws,i can't sew really well..
02-02-2020T23:18:46,RimaDraws,the only thing i know how to do is draw
02-02-2020T23:19:04,AspiringNoodle,I've dabbled in 3d modelling c:
02-02-2020T23:19:16,AspiringNoodle,"Suffice to say, modelling is probably easier than rigging xD"
02-02-2020T23:19:23,JojoF2415,I’m about to ink my drawing. Im a bit worried cause that’s 4 days worth of work
02-02-2020T23:19:51,JojoF2415,The katini recreation drawing was above 10 days
02-02-2020T23:20:44,RimaDraws,well i am sure you worked hard
02-02-2020T23:20:50,AspiringNoodle,I'm not surprised
02-02-2020T23:21:01,AspiringNoodle,Tom's had 16+ years of practice
02-02-2020T23:21:11,CrRAR,with practice you whittle down time
02-02-2020T23:21:19,AspiringNoodle,And you're recreating a work without insider knowledge of his exact workflow
02-02-2020T23:21:20,JojoF2415,I finished it the same day I joined the streams
02-02-2020T23:21:34,AspiringNoodle,"Yeah, we can *watch* him create a piece"
02-02-2020T23:21:43,AspiringNoodle,"But all the settings, layers, and tools are hidden to us"
02-02-2020T23:22:05,SpazztasticKiwi,wonder if he’s got his place or is packing waaay before necessary like I am
02-02-2020T23:22:08,JojoF2415,I’m a traditional artist
02-02-2020T23:22:20,SpazztasticKiwi,I wonder if I’m the first one starting to pack
02-02-2020T23:22:32,CrRAR,good to be prepared
02-02-2020T23:22:48,SpazztasticKiwi,my ducks are to be firmly in their row

02-02-2020T23:23:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I really wanted omni since everyone was using it and seemed to know what they got going
02-02-2020T23:23:15,JojoF2415,Did the stock market games start yesterday

02-02-2020T23:23:57,JojoF2415,I’ve been drawing since I was 11
02-02-2020T23:24:22,RimaDraws,but total years to draw is 24
02-02-2020T23:24:35,AspiringNoodle,"I'm 26, and I am looking to start up again"
02-02-2020T23:24:36,RimaDraws,and i am still practicing
02-02-2020T23:24:44,JojoF2415,My best drawing was a real life snow leopard

02-02-2020T23:27:47,AspiringNoodle,"Rima, part of my interest in drawing is that I got an art minor while I was in college"
02-02-2020T23:27:49,CrRAR,I'm slighly younger than ord
02-02-2020T23:27:53,Ordithus,I'll be 32 in 2 months
02-02-2020T23:27:56,AspiringNoodle,And I wasn't *terrible* at it xD
02-02-2020T23:27:56,RimaDraws,i wish i could noodle.
02-02-2020T23:28:02,RimaDraws,but four year college would break me
02-02-2020T23:28:11,AspiringNoodle,"Took me 6.5, lol"

02-02-2020T23:28:37,AspiringNoodle,More or less I'm trying to get my bearings and decide on a focus
02-02-2020T23:28:58,JojoF2415,I revealed my age in one of the streams but I’m sure everyone forgot
02-02-2020T23:28:59,AspiringNoodle,Doing part time work.  Might try getting a programming job in the next year.
02-02-2020T23:29:18,AspiringNoodle,"You know, something that actually pays a living wage and doesn't demand the world :P"
02-02-2020T23:29:19,RimaDraws,right now i am making a comic. and when i was a kid that was one of my dreams.
02-02-2020T23:29:48,RimaDraws,i never thought that i would be doing one just for fun

02-02-2020T23:30:55,RimaDraws,god i wish.
02-02-2020T23:31:07,JojoF2415,The fact that I drew it on the last moment
02-02-2020T23:31:34,RimaDraws,well still thats good.
02-02-2020T23:32:00,AspiringNoodle,Gonna have to dig up some color theory~
