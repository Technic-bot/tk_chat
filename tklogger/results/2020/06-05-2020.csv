06-05-2020T22:36:12,CrRAR,"hibachi this, hibachi that, I hibatchi you with a wiffle ball bat"
06-05-2020T22:36:34,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s a lil food truck so he’s got a smal plot for the business & drive up orders
06-05-2020T22:36:56,CrRAR,nice
06-05-2020T22:36:57,BlackjackSec99,"oh, not a typo? okie dokie"

06-05-2020T22:39:41,SpazztasticKiwi,"not a burnt spot anywhere, not soggy or uncooked, no tails and they’re some chunky shrimps"
06-05-2020T22:40:10,AspiringNoodle,#Capitalism baby
06-05-2020T22:40:24,AspiringNoodle,He could probably up prices 20% and people would STILL flock to the shop
06-05-2020T22:40:45,AspiringNoodle,And then he could open a restaurant at a physical location and it'd always be packed
06-05-2020T22:40:49,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s about $8 a veggie plate and $10 for shrimp
06-05-2020T22:40:54,AspiringNoodle,has evolved to DrunkNoodle... maybe
06-05-2020T22:41:01,SpazztasticKiwi,you get rice and sauce too
06-05-2020T22:41:13,AspiringNoodle,I'm finishing this drink WAAAAAAAAAY faster than I finished that Smirnoff last week :ptv-laugh:

06-05-2020T22:41:46,SpazztasticKiwi,they may build a building sometime but with the chaos they can’t even if they had the money and supplies
06-05-2020T22:42:50,SpazztasticKiwi,doesn’t hurt that the son is one of the main chefs and is definitely atty
06-05-2020T22:42:55,SpazztasticKiwi,attractive
06-05-2020T22:43:50,SpazztasticKiwi,and the shop is riiiight outside walmarts property - the only general grocery provider open

06-05-2020T22:47:10,SpazztasticKiwi,"but anyway, a forklift and you’ve worked in plumbing?"
06-05-2020T22:48:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I watched a comedian that made a good point on what’s sexy as an adult: workmen that visit and get the work done and leave a newly working sink/fridge whatever
06-05-2020T22:48:57,AspiringNoodle,"Huh, I might be legit drunk right now"
06-05-2020T22:49:19,AspiringNoodle,I feel looper than those times I drove home from college after not sleeping for like... 32 - 36 hours?

06-05-2020T22:49:39,SpazztasticKiwi,one of my favorites tho is brad upton: he started smooth talking the audience
06-05-2020T22:49:56,SpazztasticKiwi,“I did a whole round of laundry today” audience cheered

06-05-2020T22:55:46,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve had little interest in muscle and size
06-05-2020T22:55:49,AspiringNoodle,"Jojo, when you're older, try beating all these hard GD levels while drunk"

06-05-2020T22:57:31,JojoGD,A gd player called Technical got a heart rate of 200
06-05-2020T22:57:37,SpazztasticKiwi,muscle can make a guy nice to look at but it can’t be permanent - what everyone should go for is healthy
06-05-2020T23:02:13,AspiringNoodle,"Btw, who dares me?"
06-05-2020T23:02:28,AspiringNoodle,Who dares me to start playing a game known for its difficulty and an achievement for literally dying in-game
06-05-2020T23:02:35,AspiringNoodle,And doing it while drunk? :ptv-excited:

06-05-2020T23:12:09,AspiringNoodle,The music seems so epic :ptv-excited:
06-05-2020T23:12:58,AspiringNoodle,"Also, why does every geometry dash player ever have such a sensitive microphone that we can pick up on their mouse clicks above even the level music? :ptv-unimpressed:"
