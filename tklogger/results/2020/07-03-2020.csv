07-03-2020T15:06:22,Orthonox,It is Daylight Savings Time.
07-03-2020T15:06:26,TerraTheWizard,probably forgot daylight savings started
07-03-2020T15:06:37,BadFoMo,Oh...
07-03-2020T15:06:38,Roughlandin,Very possible
07-03-2020T15:07:19,Roughlandin,Gotta change them clocks so you can stay out in the fields longer. Bountiful sowing to you all
07-03-2020T15:08:08,Twokinds,It's only 3:08
07-03-2020T15:08:33,BadFoMo,I have 4:08 PM.

07-03-2020T15:09:01,Mippy,I thought it was 2:08PM
07-03-2020T15:09:05,Roughlandin,Clocks went forward last night
07-03-2020T15:09:30,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,Hi Tom
07-03-2020T15:09:34,Twokinds,I don't observe daylight savings time!

07-03-2020T15:10:09,InTheLionsDen,A conscientious sleeper
07-03-2020T15:10:18,NeonMitsumi,There was Daylight Savings Time?
07-03-2020T15:10:19,Roughlandin,I was an unconcious objector. Slept in an extra hour
07-03-2020T15:10:20,BadFoMo,...so it's going to be at 5:00 PM?
07-03-2020T15:10:26,BadFoMo,*So
07-03-2020T15:10:27,TerraTheWizard,america did dst last night
07-03-2020T15:10:28,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Does this mean I can go back to sleep for another hour?
07-03-2020T15:10:30,Twokinds,No it'll be at 4pm
07-03-2020T15:10:36,TerraTheWizard,europe doesn't do it for another 3 weeks
07-03-2020T15:10:47,NeonMitsumi,"Huh, I see."
07-03-2020T15:10:53,KitsuneShapeshifter,im against daylight time in general. :P let the moon and stars fill the sky
07-03-2020T15:10:55,Roughlandin,...We really need to standardize this stuff.
07-03-2020T15:11:05,TerraTheWizard,"because not only is this whole thing stupid, it's extra stupid because it's not centralised"
07-03-2020T15:11:22,Mippy,Just scrap the thing altogether
07-03-2020T15:11:43,luna146,Agreed. No more daylight savings time
07-03-2020T15:11:47,TerraTheWizard,iirc the eu voted to let all member states decide if they use it from now on
07-03-2020T15:11:58,Roughlandin,"But think of the WHEAT, Tom! Think of the sharecroppers!"
07-03-2020T15:12:01,Ordithus,"Just pick one, or halfsies! :ctwokinds-flomad:"
07-03-2020T15:12:01,BadFoMo,Let me re-phrase that. Will the stream start in an hour from now?

07-03-2020T23:39:46,SpazztasticKiwi,"because of that spurt of technology tho, there‚Äôs crossover of who‚Äôs a gen x, gen z, boomer & zoomer"
07-03-2020T23:40:14,Sclimshady,Theres always arguments about when the generations change
07-03-2020T23:40:14,steelabjur,"I'm Gen-X, technically. Born in '79."
07-03-2020T23:40:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I remember dial up internet and I had it at one point but it wasn‚Äôt long till we upgraded
07-03-2020T23:40:27,Sclimshady,Since the end and beginnigs are so similar
07-03-2020T23:40:39,FenceEqualizer,I remember dial up internet...dark times...

07-03-2020T23:41:42,SpazztasticKiwi,and my first phone ended up being a new model (at the time) iphone yet i can work a rotary phone or older click-four-times-for-one-letter phone
07-03-2020T23:41:43,steelabjur,Don't get me started. Getting kicked off the 'net because mom picked up the receiver got old quick. :p

07-03-2020T23:42:40,FenceEqualizer,Watching little kids show extreme confusion when shown a rotary phone is eye opening.
07-03-2020T23:42:46,SpazztasticKiwi,I know new technology and I‚Äôm quick on it but people are only shocked that I know the old stuff
07-03-2020T23:43:01,steelabjur,My first phone was a flip phone. First house phone was a rotary dial phone.
07-03-2020T23:43:15,Sclimshady,"Ngl,  I still struggle with smart phones"

07-03-2020T23:45:29,Sclimshady,"I legit cant use Iphones,  I only use Samsung"
07-03-2020T23:45:52,SpazztasticKiwi,"like Mark, when he locked Amy out of the house (the second time) and was telling us about it on stream, he said ‚ÄúI wish there was an override feature for do not disturb mode [on iphones]‚Äù"
07-03-2020T23:45:58,SpazztasticKiwi,there is
