23-04-2020T21:58:58,unsteddyphoenix,I went to rtx once and still couldnt get an autograph
23-04-2020T21:59:04,ZRO4825,Blue's name iirc is Jen Carrol
23-04-2020T21:59:05,SageSaga,"Jen ""Blue"" Summers"
23-04-2020T21:59:11,SageSaga,lol
23-04-2020T21:59:11,ZRO4825,wow I mixed that up
23-04-2020T21:59:12,Ordithus,"hence Blue is her nickname, so she has multiple :P"
23-04-2020T21:59:19,SageSaga,i typoed
23-04-2020T21:59:22,SageSaga,sorta

23-04-2020T21:59:47,ZRO4825,"Oh, wait...was I right? lmao"
23-04-2020T21:59:57,SageSaga,and how her name is Summers and Blue was based on a friend that's last name was Summers
23-04-2020T22:00:04,TheWiseMankey,Who wants to see it? (Assuming Phil allows me to link it. It's not NSFW for the record...)
23-04-2020T22:00:09,Ordithus,not at all confusing
23-04-2020T22:00:17,StrikerWolfcat,hmm
23-04-2020T22:00:25,Ordithus,As long as it's SFW and you describe the link when you link it
23-04-2020T22:00:28,ZRO4825,"Speaking of Blue, today's page was <3 Sage"
23-04-2020T22:00:37,ZRO4825,"And you were right. long time coming, lol"
23-04-2020T22:00:40,SageSaga,"but yes- Jen ""Blue"" Carell"
23-04-2020T22:00:51,Ordithus,teased for YEARS
23-04-2020T22:00:58,TheWiseMankey,"In that case, here's my SFWish Blue x Nami pic that Phil did for me an age ago: https://www.deviantart.com/sageofotherworlds/art/Commission-Blue-and-Nami-102415480"
23-04-2020T22:01:02,ZRO4825,"ah, Carell. I misspelled it. ;_;"
23-04-2020T22:01:16,Ordithus,Hehe nice <3
23-04-2020T22:01:52,TheWiseMankey,"Honestly, I should commission it more often. Or get one of Kaylin x Nyna. Whichever come first."
23-04-2020T22:01:58,ZRO4825,"Ahhh, done back in the days when I was merely one of the strange people that occasionally showed up in the comments on the pages."

23-04-2020T23:27:57,Dadrobit,Maybe it operates off of Bayonetta logic and the bikini was just highly condensed dragon scales?

23-04-2020T23:28:55,BadFoMo,...How?
23-04-2020T23:29:00,Dadrobit,"Bayonetta, old Wii game. Main character's hair was also her boodysuit."

23-04-2020T23:30:46,AspiringNoodle,"And given her acrobatic antics while fighting, it makes the most sense"
23-04-2020T23:30:49,BadFoMo,Coulsn't she just wear normal clothes?

23-04-2020T23:33:42,Ordithus,"yep, same problem"
23-04-2020T23:33:44,BadFoMo,@Ordithus Oh! What about... 'Bug Island' was it called?
23-04-2020T23:33:45,AspiringNoodle,"And I'm slowly finding that out, lol"
23-04-2020T23:33:58,AspiringNoodle,"Though it's more to do with my love of RPGs, which tend to be CHUNKY game experiences"
23-04-2020T23:34:03,ZRO4825,"Yeah, hard for me to look at it like that when I can see that rest of the health bar, Noodle. :rofl:"
23-04-2020T23:34:24,AspiringNoodle,"Well Zro, if you're the host of that world, you're the only one with that extra health"
23-04-2020T23:34:38,AspiringNoodle,"Invaders and phantoms have the ""lesser"" health amount :snail:"

23-04-2020T23:35:25,Dadrobit,Just play offline mode?
23-04-2020T23:35:28,AspiringNoodle,That's why they only get half the healing items as the host.  The host can also have 2 - 3 people helping them
23-04-2020T23:35:32,AspiringNoodle,There's also that
23-04-2020T23:35:33,MuonNeutrino,all of the souls games have their own weird bits
23-04-2020T23:36:09,SageSaga,new game just came out that i want but im gonna wait for a sale
23-04-2020T23:36:10,AspiringNoodle,"I'm quickly realizing that Dark Souls, and RPG games in general, are massive enemies to my backlog.  Just like multiplayer titles :ptv-laugh:"
23-04-2020T23:36:10,ZRO4825,"Yeah, that's my problem Keef. I'm okay-ish at the game, but I'm not good at all at PVPing in it, lol"
23-04-2020T23:36:17,ZRO4825,"What game, Sage? :o"
23-04-2020T23:36:19,MuonNeutrino,"bloodborne decided that making you grind for healing charges was a good idea, 2 had that dumb 'get punished for dying by losing HP and making it easier to die again' system, and 3 has the ''opt in to being ganked to get your full hp' thing"
23-04-2020T23:36:23,SageSaga,Trials of Mana

23-04-2020T23:36:57,AspiringNoodle,Right now i'm playing through Dark Souls 2 to scratch my dark souls itch.
23-04-2020T23:37:06,Dadrobit,"Also, grinding for healing charges?"
23-04-2020T23:37:08,AspiringNoodle,This thing is MURDER on my backlog with how much time it takes to do everything
23-04-2020T23:37:46,ZRO4825,I prefer the Nioh games for my DS-esque games.
23-04-2020T23:37:47,MuonNeutrino,bloodborne you had to get charges for your blood vial as drops
23-04-2020T23:37:54,AspiringNoodle,"RPGs, amazing amounts of content for the money, but kills your time if you like other things :ptv-shock:"
23-04-2020T23:38:02,Dadrobit,Blood Vials dropped like cany from a pinata.
23-04-2020T23:38:06,MuonNeutrino,yeah
23-04-2020T23:38:15,MuonNeutrino,but if you died to a boss enough times you'd eventually run out
23-04-2020T23:38:29,Ordithus,"I have that, Sage.  Haven't started it yet"
23-04-2020T23:38:29,MuonNeutrino,and dying to a boss a bllion times is kinda a souls game staple >.>
23-04-2020T23:38:37,Dadrobit,I mean... I guess?
23-04-2020T23:38:46,Ordithus,It's somewhere in the pile of games to play :ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
23-04-2020T23:38:56,ZRO4825,Worst boss in Nioh 2 killed me 74 times before I got it down. <_<;;;
23-04-2020T23:38:57,Dadrobit,Never had that problem personally at least.
23-04-2020T23:39:02,MuonNeutrino,v0v
23-04-2020T23:39:05,AspiringNoodle,It's funny.  We have more entertainment than ever before
23-04-2020T23:39:12,ZRO4825,The rest of them didn't even kill me 10 times. :joy:
23-04-2020T23:39:14,Dadrobit,Which sounds like a bad brag now that I read it.
23-04-2020T23:39:15,AspiringNoodle,But society as a whole is working harder and longer than ever as well :snail:
23-04-2020T23:39:16,MuonNeutrino,"i never played bloodborne, but i watched my brother play it a lot and he ran into that several times"
23-04-2020T23:39:41,SageSaga,with Dark Souls 3 i think i stopped at New Game +6
23-04-2020T23:39:50,ZRO4825,o.o;
23-04-2020T23:39:59,AspiringNoodle,I don't think DS3 has any changes to the game past NG+
23-04-2020T23:40:08,SageSaga,it does
23-04-2020T23:40:09,MuonNeutrino,"i haven't gotten to dark souls 3 yet, i played 1 a couple years ago and finished 2 this spring, gonna start 3 once the semester's over"
23-04-2020T23:40:12,AspiringNoodle,"Oh, nice"
23-04-2020T23:40:30,AspiringNoodle,I know Dark Souls 2 has changes that kick in in +1 / +2
23-04-2020T23:40:36,MuonNeutrino,yeah
23-04-2020T23:41:00,MuonNeutrino,"like you can't get the flame weapon pyromancy in ng, you have to beat a certain boss in NG+"
23-04-2020T23:41:04,AspiringNoodle,"Muon, I think I feel this way about RPGs, I love them to death, but at the same time wish I never started playing them"
23-04-2020T23:41:09,SageSaga,i dont think it like adds new items or anything to the game- but monsters do more damage have more health and of course- give lots more souls
23-04-2020T23:41:10,MuonNeutrino,"side note, that boss is a bitch in ng+ lol"
23-04-2020T23:41:34,AspiringNoodle,I'd have so much more time for other games and I think my backlog would be nonexistent :ptv-laugh:
23-04-2020T23:41:39,MuonNeutrino,heh
23-04-2020T23:41:41,ZRO4825,"I keep meaning to try and get into the DS series again at some point, just to play through'em for storyline and such if nothing else."
23-04-2020T23:41:52,unsteddyphoenix,"Man its lame when its just ""give more health"""
23-04-2020T23:41:58,ZRO4825,Storyline always seemed to be....kinda nonexistent in them from what I saw though. :thinking:
23-04-2020T23:42:01,AspiringNoodle,In DS2 I'm being an absolute monster in PvP
23-04-2020T23:42:02,MuonNeutrino,"i played all the way through DS2 3 times over the past few months, i enjoyed it but yeah that's a lengthy game"
23-04-2020T23:42:10,unsteddyphoenix,Itd be way cooler if a NG+ gave the monster new moves and shit
23-04-2020T23:42:10,SageSaga,i was hoping my friends would play with me in DS3 but none of them would
23-04-2020T23:42:14,SageSaga,not even lann
23-04-2020T23:42:16,AspiringNoodle,"Zro, to really get the story, and I mean REALLy, you need to talk to every character"
23-04-2020T23:42:17,ZRO4825,:c
23-04-2020T23:42:21,AspiringNoodle,Exhaust all dialogue options
23-04-2020T23:42:29,AspiringNoodle,And read all the gear / spell text
23-04-2020T23:42:30,MuonNeutrino,read all the item descriptions
23-04-2020T23:42:32,MuonNeutrino,yeah
23-04-2020T23:42:38,MuonNeutrino,and do a LOT of speculation
23-04-2020T23:42:47,ZRO4825,You want me to READ? In a GAME? :ptv-shock:
23-04-2020T23:42:50,MuonNeutrino,"the dark souls games have story, but they're very mysterious about them"
23-04-2020T23:42:54,AspiringNoodle,^
23-04-2020T23:42:55,KeefMcDerpface,Yes?
23-04-2020T23:42:58,AspiringNoodle,You have to piece everything together
23-04-2020T23:42:59,MuonNeutrino,"they do't feed them to you, you have to work for it"
23-04-2020T23:43:10,KeefMcDerpface,^
23-04-2020T23:43:11,MuonNeutrino,i'm sure i'll run into even more of that once i start ds3
23-04-2020T23:43:13,AspiringNoodle,"That said, Phil, what platform do you play on?"
23-04-2020T23:43:25,MarvTheHugPharaoh,A lot is inferred and not really confirmed
23-04-2020T23:43:31,ZRO4825,"Yeah, see, I do but don't like that. I don't mind if I have to go digging for deep storyline. But I don't like how there's damned near NONE of it if you don't."
23-04-2020T23:43:33,AspiringNoodle,"And I feel like an a-hole in PvP because I know how to parry, lol"
23-04-2020T23:43:42,SageSaga,no one calls me Phil online
23-04-2020T23:43:49,ZRO4825,:joy:
23-04-2020T23:43:54,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-shock:
23-04-2020T23:44:01,AspiringNoodle,Have I been living a lie??
23-04-2020T23:44:06,KeefMcDerpface,Maybe/
23-04-2020T23:44:08,KeefMcDerpface,?
23-04-2020T23:44:08,SageSaga,Tom doesnt even call me Phil IRL
23-04-2020T23:44:14,AspiringNoodle,Just Sage?
23-04-2020T23:44:18,SageSaga,yep
23-04-2020T23:44:21,ZRO4825,Pretty sure that this point he's just Sage to anyone that knows him. :rofl:
23-04-2020T23:44:21,MuonNeutrino,for pvp it mostly annoys me that whatever build you've got that works just fine for the rest of the game is probably shit for pvp
23-04-2020T23:44:41,MuonNeutrino,so you're goin along and you get invaded and you probably might as well just jump off a cliff
23-04-2020T23:44:51,SageSaga,i play on PC of course btw
23-04-2020T23:44:56,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-excited:
23-04-2020T23:45:09,AspiringNoodle,...I should finish DS2 first...
23-04-2020T23:45:43,AspiringNoodle,"Right now I'm at the Iron Keep, and I'm farming scrubs at Belfry Sol for titanite chunks with the agape ring so SM doesn't go up. :ptv-uneasy:"
23-04-2020T23:45:52,ZRO4825,"I originally played it on PS4 personally, but, I've picked it up on PC as well over time (cuz Humble Bundle Monthly ftw, lmao)"
23-04-2020T23:45:57,MuonNeutrino,also i really get annoyed when i get invaded while just standing at a bonfire with my summon sign out looking for JOLLY COOPERATION
23-04-2020T23:45:59,MuonNeutrino,>.>
23-04-2020T23:46:10,AspiringNoodle,"Muon, you don't know happiness until you duel someone and parry them 3 times in a row"
23-04-2020T23:46:30,AspiringNoodle,"Not even spam parry, prediction / reaction."
23-04-2020T23:46:36,MuonNeutrino,i've never been able to get parrying to work in either ds1 or ds2
23-04-2020T23:46:53,MuonNeutrino,it just never works enough to rely on
23-04-2020T23:46:55,KeefMcDerpface,Is Noodle the true parry god? :ptv-excited:
23-04-2020T23:47:20,AspiringNoodle,DS1 I wouldn't even bother just because there's so many other broken mechanics
23-04-2020T23:47:42,AspiringNoodle,"DS2, I think it might have netcode / lag issues.  From what I've seen, DS3 has the most solid experience for doing parries"
23-04-2020T23:47:56,MuonNeutrino,i've never been able to get parrying to work even in pve
23-04-2020T23:48:01,unsteddyphoenix,Dat dragon butt :ptv-sneakysmirk:
23-04-2020T23:48:03,MuonNeutrino,the timing windows are just so damn wonky
23-04-2020T23:48:20,ZRO4825,Parry in DS has never felt good to me.
23-04-2020T23:48:22,AspiringNoodle,"First rule of parrying, never use a medium shield or bigger"
23-04-2020T23:48:24,KeefMcDerpface,:eyes:
23-04-2020T23:48:26,MuonNeutrino,but i agree that ds2 seems to have some rather janky netcode
23-04-2020T23:48:29,AspiringNoodle,"Small shield, parry shield, or parrying weapon"
23-04-2020T23:48:33,MuonNeutrino,"yup, done that"
23-04-2020T23:48:40,MuonNeutrino,still never got it to work very well
23-04-2020T23:48:51,MuonNeutrino,something about the timing for those just weirds me out
23-04-2020T23:49:11,SwiftKitten,NOT THE DRESS
23-04-2020T23:49:11,ZRO4825,Parry in Nioh felt frickin wonderful. In Nioh 2 I think they fooked with some of the timing windows against some attacks and it's screwed with it a wee bit.
23-04-2020T23:49:14,AspiringNoodle,"I would say practice in DS3.  I'm not sure about 2, and I KNOW 1 doesn't work the same way as 3"
23-04-2020T23:50:19,AspiringNoodle,And here's how parrying works.  There are 3 phases that every shield / weapon that can parry are broken up into
23-04-2020T23:50:47,MuonNeutrino,"yeah, i looked up the mechanics, i just could never get the hang of the timing"
23-04-2020T23:50:56,AspiringNoodle,Huh...
23-04-2020T23:51:01,swack24,D'aww Reni is back geing a cute Dragon again
23-04-2020T23:51:12,ZRO4825,some of us I think just don't see the game in the same FPS as others. :P
23-04-2020T23:51:24,KeefMcDerpface,"""Cute."""
23-04-2020T23:51:26,MuonNeutrino,i always ended up parrying too early or late
23-04-2020T23:51:38,ZRO4825,"I've seen people who can tell you when to do something to hit a 1-frame connect on a combo, and I'm watching going ""....no, seriously, how you do that?"" lol"
23-04-2020T23:51:41,AspiringNoodle,"TBF, parrying is very time sensitive"
23-04-2020T23:52:01,AspiringNoodle,Considering that you more or less are working with a 1/6th of a second window where you can actually parry
23-04-2020T23:52:14,MuonNeutrino,"yeah, which is why i eventually gave up on it, it just wasn't feasible when i would get hit at least 3 out of every 4 times i tried"
23-04-2020T23:52:46,Ordithus,is it bad that's my experience parrying in botw? :ptv-uneasy:
23-04-2020T23:52:54,AspiringNoodle,"Not at all, lol"
23-04-2020T23:53:08,MuonNeutrino,"maybe i could have eventually gotten better at it, but i wasn't really interested in dying *even more hundreds of times* first XD"
23-04-2020T23:53:10,Ordithus,"completely gave up on that, headshots with the bow all day isntead"
23-04-2020T23:53:14,AspiringNoodle,"Muon, have you tried doing the setup parry?"
23-04-2020T23:53:19,MuonNeutrino,no idea what that is
23-04-2020T23:53:36,AspiringNoodle,"In Dark Souls 3, a lot of newbs use a straight sword"
23-04-2020T23:53:47,AspiringNoodle,"So if you invade them, they are likely going to spam R1"
23-04-2020T23:54:15,AspiringNoodle,"Hits 1 and 2 you can do nothing about, on swing 3 you can hit the parry button and they've done themselves in"
23-04-2020T23:54:15,SageSaga,GREAT AXE
23-04-2020T23:54:21,AspiringNoodle,Rolling backstab
23-04-2020T23:54:35,MuonNeutrino,tbh i've never even tried to parry in pvp
23-04-2020T23:54:48,MuonNeutrino,i'm usually the one on the 'r1 spam' side >.>
23-04-2020T23:55:15,CrRAR,"Reni: ""Make me fight naked, will you?"""
23-04-2020T23:55:18,CrRAR,"""Lets make this quick~"""
23-04-2020T23:55:23,AspiringNoodle,PvP parrying more often falls into prediction or setup territory
23-04-2020T23:55:30,PostApocalypticDrifter,night all
23-04-2020T23:55:33,MuonNeutrino,"i've never actually been interested in pvp in those games, so the only times i ever end up in it is when i get invaded"
23-04-2020T23:55:35,KeefMcDerpface,bye Drifter
23-04-2020T23:55:38,MuonNeutrino,so i have very little experience with it
23-04-2020T23:55:49,AspiringNoodle,"You can reactive parry with a target shield / buckler, but it requires a pretty tight connection and quick reflexes"
23-04-2020T23:56:13,AspiringNoodle,Meanwhile I'm invading in DS2 and parrying for days :ptv-uneasy:
23-04-2020T23:56:51,AspiringNoodle,"I genuinely feel sorry for some people who are actively seeking the PvP too, and getting trounced by a noob"
23-04-2020T23:57:14,Sclimshady,"Busted, down on bourbon street, set up, like a bowlin' pin â™ª"
23-04-2020T23:57:36,ThoseButterflys,I finally made it to a friday night stream
23-04-2020T23:57:41,KeefMcDerpface,Welcome
23-04-2020T23:57:41,AspiringNoodle,Congrats :D
23-04-2020T23:57:46,unsteddyphoenix,Proud of you\
23-04-2020T23:58:04,KeefMcDerpface,"Quick, someone give this man a medal."
23-04-2020T23:58:05,ThoseButterflys,But I will probably pass out in a frw minutes
23-04-2020T23:58:08,Dadrobit,"Alright, I'm throwing in the proverbial towel, I'm too tired. Gonna call it a night methinks."
23-04-2020T23:58:16,CrRAR,:v: daddy
23-04-2020T23:58:17,KeefMcDerpface,bye Dad
23-04-2020T23:58:26,ZRO4825,Have a g'night Dadro!
23-04-2020T23:58:26,Dadrobit,Thanks kindly y'all for the streams.

23-04-2020T23:58:32,MarvTheHugPharaoh,See ya Dad
