09-01-2020T21:57:07,KeefMcDerpface,Which GTA?
09-01-2020T21:57:50,SageSaga,if you need something to hug i recommend a Mihari Dakimakura - since i sold out and there are no Twokinds body pillows to plug for Tom
09-01-2020T21:57:58,NezumiYuki,Flora’s chest floof is like a Tardis in a way!  It hides her lady bumps almost too well in a pocket dimension like Nat’s wrappings....

09-01-2020T22:47:25,SageSaga,it sounds bad- and its a big thing- but they dont go into it enough when it first happens
09-01-2020T22:47:29,KiTA,like Cannibalism
09-01-2020T22:47:39,KiTA,or picking evil evolutions in the skilltree
09-01-2020T22:47:45,SageSaga,its not raised by evil actions

09-01-2020T22:50:15,SageSaga,well he has a skill thats totally not evil at all in the slightest
09-01-2020T22:50:16,CrimsonHelsing,"I assume a scripted event around level 10, cuz... well, it doesn't sound like some random encounter in the game at first glance"
09-01-2020T22:50:22,SageSaga,and each time he uses it Taboo goes up
09-01-2020T22:51:08,SageSaga,"one of the best ways to describe it is doing something that is seen to be morally wrong- or more importantly- goes against ""The System"""
09-01-2020T22:51:29,KiTA,I remember reading the... WN?  LN?  and they introduce the danger of the monkeys by having some evil bastard drop one in a fortress and they accidentally kill it
