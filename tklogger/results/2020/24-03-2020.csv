24-03-2020T01:17:06,AspiringNoodle,2 people shifts are just frustrating.  Period.  Too much to do.  Very little downtime unless absolutely ded.

24-03-2020T01:18:36,AspiringNoodle,And we could afford to schedule a third person for 2nd shift

24-03-2020T01:19:31,CrRAR,yeah
24-03-2020T01:19:39,AspiringNoodle,I ran 2nd shift solo once.  I basically flipped our checklist the bird

24-03-2020T18:07:34,AspiringNoodle,"Even later date (past few days), GameStop closes all locations as a result of costomer outrage, employee protests, and GOVERNMENT ORDERS."
24-03-2020T18:08:06,AspiringNoodle,"customer*  I can't type today, lol"
24-03-2020T18:11:44,IronHorseComics,*facepalm*
24-03-2020T18:11:48,IronHorseComics,dammit Gamestop
24-03-2020T18:12:03,IronHorseComics,I remember when you guys were cool
24-03-2020T18:12:41,CrRAR,"yeah, if the authorities want it closed these days they'll just revoke the business's license."
24-03-2020T18:12:47,CrRAR,...or threaten to.
24-03-2020T18:12:51,AspiringNoodle,That's what I heard
24-03-2020T18:13:06,AspiringNoodle,That the government threatened to revoke GameStop's business license if they didn't shut down all locations
24-03-2020T18:13:12,CrRAR,yup
24-03-2020T18:13:27,AspiringNoodle,You know what's really sad?
24-03-2020T18:13:35,CrRAR,what?
24-03-2020T18:13:40,IronHorseComics,this bad PR is going to kill the company?
24-03-2020T18:13:45,AspiringNoodle,I just learned that some unnamed game store somewhere in the US is making a killing right now
24-03-2020T18:13:56,IronHorseComics,much like how the virus is trying to kill Waffle House
24-03-2020T18:14:01,AspiringNoodle,"They're earning all the good guy points, and even their local government can't find a reason to shut them down"
24-03-2020T18:14:02,IronHorseComics,the bastard
24-03-2020T18:14:11,IronHorseComics,that's impressive
24-03-2020T18:14:13,CrRAR,no not Waffle House ;_;
24-03-2020T18:14:22,AspiringNoodle,"First off, their employees are working VOLUNTARILY during all this"
24-03-2020T18:14:32,CrRAR,"IHOP, sure, but NOT Waffle HOUSE"
24-03-2020T18:14:33,IronHorseComics,over 300 locations closed down out of over 1600
24-03-2020T18:14:37,AspiringNoodle,"As long as the lockdown is in effect, any employee who chooses to work gets time-and-a-half"
24-03-2020T18:14:54,AspiringNoodle,Good guy points: 1
24-03-2020T18:14:56,IronHorseComics,they must have a really nice boss
24-03-2020T18:15:20,AspiringNoodle,Gloves are provided free of charge at the store entrance.  You are not allowed to enter without gloves on.
24-03-2020T18:15:24,AspiringNoodle,Good guy points: 2
24-03-2020T18:15:35,AspiringNoodle,No more than 10 customers in the store at any given time
24-03-2020T18:15:38,AspiringNoodle,GGP: 3
24-03-2020T18:15:51,AspiringNoodle,All surfaces sanitized hourly
24-03-2020T18:15:54,AspiringNoodle,GGP: 4
24-03-2020T18:16:01,IronHorseComics,I'm surprised they were able to get more than 10 people at a time
24-03-2020T18:16:20,IronHorseComics,usually when I visit gamestop it's friggin' empty
24-03-2020T18:16:21,CrRAR,Yeah the extra sanitation work is already partly crippling to work shifts xD
24-03-2020T18:16:41,AspiringNoodle,"Hand sanitizer is offered in store, and must be applied over gloves before approaching counter to make purchases"
24-03-2020T18:16:42,CrRAR,"Like especially on the reduced workforce, it makes no sense"
24-03-2020T18:16:48,AspiringNoodle,GGP: 5
24-03-2020T18:17:11,AspiringNoodle,The local government snuck some plain clothes health inspectors into the store and they came up with nothing
24-03-2020T18:17:14,CrRAR,lol Sanitize the gloves because you can't have enough to dispose of them
24-03-2020T18:17:16,CrRAR,wow
24-03-2020T18:17:31,AspiringNoodle,"No, the idea is that the gloves themselves could be contaminated"
24-03-2020T18:17:41,AspiringNoodle,So it adds an extra layer of protection to all parties
24-03-2020T18:18:05,CrRAR,yeah
24-03-2020T18:18:17,CrRAR,Just not getting to change em seems weird
24-03-2020T18:18:27,CrRAR,I understand though
24-03-2020T18:18:39,AspiringNoodle,"So this local store is making a killing, and the government can't find any faults with their practices"
24-03-2020T18:19:31,AspiringNoodle,"When I go to work on Friday, I'll try to do a better job of sanitizing in-store surfaces, but it will be hard if they haven't cut any other tasks and still only have 2 people on 2nd"
24-03-2020T18:20:00,AspiringNoodle,"Like, we're talking even BEFORE this whole pandemic, there was too much to do on 2nd shift with only 2 people"
24-03-2020T18:20:16,CrRAR,yeah that's what I was getting at
24-03-2020T18:20:23,CrRAR,So many places already strung out
24-03-2020T18:20:24,AspiringNoodle,And then they tack on that they want all high-volume surfaces sanitized at least every 2 hours
24-03-2020T18:20:27,CrRAR,yeah
24-03-2020T18:20:39,AspiringNoodle,"And it's a 30 - 60 min job, depending on how thorough you are"
24-03-2020T18:21:14,CrRAR,Like your whole job will become making sure the place can stay open while unable to do the essential tasks to keep the services operating
24-03-2020T18:21:21,CrRAR,:ccrrar-reni:
24-03-2020T18:21:42,AspiringNoodle,"Tbh, if they just completely eliminated self-serve, that would clear up a whole lot of time"
24-03-2020T18:21:54,AspiringNoodle,Takes roughly 20 - 30 min uninterrupted to refresh coffee
24-03-2020T18:22:54,AspiringNoodle,"And people generally leave the coffee bar a mess.  We're talking spilt creamers, coffee drips, sometimes they just leave their stirrer on the counter, used, sometimes right next to the opening for the trash bin"
24-03-2020T18:24:01,AspiringNoodle,"Also, don't get me started on expiration dates, lmao"
24-03-2020T18:24:11,AspiringNoodle,Because I'm about half-way done with my next round of dating everything
24-03-2020T18:24:28,AspiringNoodle,And I'm finding shit that was dated for 2019.  I cleared the entire store back in january
24-03-2020T18:24:39,AspiringNoodle,This means people are putting things out from backstock and not checking the dates.
24-03-2020T18:24:56,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-angry:
24-03-2020T18:28:44,AspiringNoodle,...I wonder if we will shut down self serve eventually
24-03-2020T18:29:05,AspiringNoodle,"Heck, we're now no longer 24/7, and I thought that would be the LAST thing they'd do"
24-03-2020T18:29:38,AspiringNoodle,It's gonna be fun closing up on Friday (maybe?  dunno if I'm gonna be there until 10)
24-03-2020T18:30:01,CrRAR,"lol expiration dates, all too familiar to spazz."
24-03-2020T18:30:11,AspiringNoodle,Wonder if one of our managers will pop by to lock up the place
24-03-2020T18:30:26,AspiringNoodle,"rar, it's madness"
24-03-2020T18:30:31,CrRAR,It is getting pretty serious pretty quickly I think it's going to get more drastic
24-03-2020T18:30:42,CrRAR,quik
24-03-2020T18:30:42,AspiringNoodle,Both me and the other young vet talked to the manager about proper stocking
24-03-2020T18:30:56,IronHorseComics,"aaaarrrrg I wish Tom was here, I need to ask him a technique question"
24-03-2020T18:31:05,AspiringNoodle,"You have no idea how pissed I get when I pull out the ENTIRE peg, and the dating scheme is nonsensical"
24-03-2020T18:31:30,AspiringNoodle,And I HAVE to do it because I have zero faith that they stock properly.  And time and time again I'm proven right
24-03-2020T18:31:40,AspiringNoodle,So I have to spend extra time fixing their mistakes AND pulling dated products
24-03-2020T18:31:54,IronHorseComics,I'm surprised they keep some of the outdated stuff
24-03-2020T18:32:06,AspiringNoodle,The problem is that we don't get enough time to check very often
24-03-2020T18:32:14,AspiringNoodle,Normally I'm bucking other tasks to do this
24-03-2020T18:32:28,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-rainehappy: have a happy Raine to brighten your day

24-03-2020T18:33:17,AspiringNoodle,"Before I left work on saturday, I had made a list of stuff that expired within 4 days so they could pull it while I was off"
24-03-2020T18:33:49,AspiringNoodle,"Also, if things were stocked properly, I wouldn't need to spend so long checking everything"
24-03-2020T18:34:12,AspiringNoodle,"I would just need to check the very first thing, and if it's expired, keep pulling until I hit one that's good"

24-03-2020T20:46:07,CrRAR,"Do it for the bunny, Spazz"
24-03-2020T20:46:09,tehbear,you have to try it with a vr headset.
24-03-2020T20:46:13,IronHorseComics,eh? Alyex?
24-03-2020T20:46:16,CrRAR,EVERYTHING is for the bunny.
24-03-2020T20:46:17,IronHorseComics,the heck is that?
24-03-2020T20:46:20,CrRAR,;_;
24-03-2020T20:46:33,CrRAR,Alyx is the character from later in the series
24-03-2020T20:46:35,tehbear,Alyx Vance is the daughter of Eli Vance
24-03-2020T20:46:46,IronHorseComics,is this Doom?
24-03-2020T20:46:46,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve only finished two 2 hour episodes he’s done and he did the whole game in 7 parts
24-03-2020T20:46:53,tehbear,and a side character in Half-Life 2
24-03-2020T20:47:10,IronHorseComics,I never played Doom and I don't have any interest in it
24-03-2020T20:47:24,SpazztasticKiwi,most I knew was the difference between the doom guy and the halo guy
24-03-2020T20:47:33,Ordithus,played the original doom back in the day
24-03-2020T20:47:35,Ordithus,was fun
24-03-2020T20:47:37,tehbear,new Doom is fun. Feels like the old fast paced FPSs of the 90s and early 2000s
24-03-2020T20:47:37,SpazztasticKiwi,that they were different characters
24-03-2020T20:47:43,AspiringNoodle,I'm tempted to buy the old dooms
24-03-2020T20:47:46,AspiringNoodle,play the original
24-03-2020T20:47:51,CrRAR,doomdoomdoom
24-03-2020T20:48:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"watching Jack play, he’s going over who and what’s what"

24-03-2020T20:49:43,SpazztasticKiwi,the problem with this is I might need to watch Jacks series before Marks
24-03-2020T20:50:08,SpazztasticKiwi,because mark has a tendency to go in guns blazing until it’s finished
24-03-2020T20:50:25,CrRAR,"""So anyways, I start blasting"""

24-03-2020T20:51:47,CrRAR,finely tuned reaction times
24-03-2020T20:51:48,AspiringNoodle,"Also this one, both are memes of Animal Crossing / Doom launching on the same day: https://twitter.com/SorcererLance/status/1240813751764496384?s=20"

24-03-2020T20:56:41,AspiringNoodle,At this point... I would LOVE a crossover game
24-03-2020T20:57:03,AspiringNoodle,One where Isabelle helps the Doom Slayer decorate his base and keep things running
24-03-2020T20:57:16,AspiringNoodle,And the Doom Slayer brings Isabelle along to RIP AND TEAR.
24-03-2020T20:57:23,JojoF2415,The ship part on nine circles is annoying
24-03-2020T20:59:03,CrRAR,She can rip and tear... this fine fabric to make some lovely curtains!
