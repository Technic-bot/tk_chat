14-11-2020T01:00:38,SpazztasticKiwi,not sports ratings
14-11-2020T01:02:05,AspiringNoodle,I care.  Because my family is planning on doing thanksgiving in another state
14-11-2020T01:02:31,AspiringNoodle,"Luckily, I work that day, so I won't go anywhere near that"

14-11-2020T11:33:42,Dadrobit,OneDrive is not being very nice...
14-11-2020T11:34:11,Dadrobit,Trying to upload a 2gig video from my phone and after 40 minutes it's still not done...
14-11-2020T11:35:49,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-renirar: mornin robit
14-11-2020T11:36:01,Dadrobit,Morning!
14-11-2020T11:36:29,Dadrobit,Gotta edit this silly little speech I recorded for my class.
14-11-2020T11:36:45,Ordithus,2 gigs is a lot of file.
14-11-2020T11:36:59,Dadrobit,"1.81 I think is the exact, but still."
14-11-2020T11:37:23,Dadrobit,17 and a half minutes.
14-11-2020T11:37:32,Ordithus,That seems reasonable
14-11-2020T11:37:40,Ordithus,What's your upload speed?
14-11-2020T11:38:56,Dadrobit,26.75 Mbps
14-11-2020T11:39:41,Ordithus,nice
14-11-2020T11:39:50,Ordithus,I have 10
14-11-2020T11:40:10,Dadrobit,It SHOULD only be taking about a minute or two. But here I am the better part of an hour later...
14-11-2020T11:41:23,Ordithus,My job often involves lots lots of analysis - I can easily make 20+ GB in a day. I've found it is faster to load that onto a usb drive and drive to the office to upload there than just use my internet
14-11-2020T11:41:33,Ordithus,A lot faster
14-11-2020T11:41:53,Ordithus,Don't forget bit v byte
14-11-2020T11:42:01,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I can definitely imagine that. But I gotta get this video off of my phone."
14-11-2020T11:43:09,Dadrobit,"Ohhh, you're right, I have the dumb."
14-11-2020T11:43:23,Dadrobit,"Still, only around 10 minutes after that conversion."
14-11-2020T11:45:01,Ordithus,hmm yep
14-11-2020T11:45:03,Ordithus,math checks out
14-11-2020T11:50:52,Ordithus,well good luck. I gotta run. Got 8 inches of snow last night

14-11-2020T15:16:26,Ordithus,I remember when I started at McD's. I delivered many disappointing ice cream cones
14-11-2020T15:16:30,Ordithus,I got better!
14-11-2020T15:18:15,AspiringNoodle,Ironically my first job was ice cream related
14-11-2020T15:18:30,AspiringNoodle,"Didn't take long for me to make amazing, very tight swirls :ptv-excited:"
14-11-2020T15:18:48,AspiringNoodle,My favorite moments from that job was when they'd order a cone with sprinkles and it'd be for a kid
14-11-2020T15:19:06,CrRAR,It’s alllll in the wrist~
14-11-2020T15:19:10,AspiringNoodle,And when their little faces lit up at this beautifully done cone just absolutely coated in sprinkles >w<

14-11-2020T16:03:00,MarvTheHugPharaoh,It's the bang I'm looking for right now.  So it's prefect
14-11-2020T16:03:01,CrimsonQuill,Could I try a can of bang? Maybe it'll give me a study ethic.
14-11-2020T16:03:11,CrimsonQuill,This rhubarb vodka isn't working.

14-11-2020T16:07:45,ZapiliDver,Hi Mad!
14-11-2020T16:07:55,TheSexyBeast,... rhubarb vodka? Was the store out of turpentine?
14-11-2020T16:08:01,CrimsonQuill,Nope
14-11-2020T16:08:09,CrimsonQuill,A member of my family made it
14-11-2020T16:08:17,CrimsonQuill,And gave me a bottle
14-11-2020T16:08:26,InTheLionsDen,How is it?
14-11-2020T16:08:28,CrimsonQuill,They can also make sloe gin
14-11-2020T16:08:31,TheSexyBeast,Do they like you?
14-11-2020T16:08:33,RedEyesWheeler,I'm watching Deep Space Nine myself (Best Star Trek)
14-11-2020T16:08:33,CrimsonQuill,The vodka has a LOVELY taste.
14-11-2020T16:08:35,Roughlandin,Does that make it technically gin anyway?
14-11-2020T16:08:49,CrimsonQuill,"@TheSexyBeast They're very much close family, so i think so"
14-11-2020T16:09:02,Roughlandin,What's the difference between infused vodka and gin anyway?
14-11-2020T16:09:02,CrimsonQuill,@Roughlandin I think this is definitely vodka.
14-11-2020T16:09:09,CrimsonQuill,Fermented rhubarb anyhow
14-11-2020T16:09:25,CrimsonQuill,I was considering a Jack Daniels but I had that last week.
14-11-2020T16:09:34,CrimsonQuill,Maybe when I run out I'll see what a scotch is like.
14-11-2020T16:09:34,TheSexyBeast,Rhubsrb generally gets paired with something sweet
14-11-2020T16:09:36,Roughlandin,Oh okay I thought you meant rhubarb infused grain vodka
14-11-2020T16:09:58,Rainelover,My dad has so much fucking alcohol in his displays that you would die of alcohol poisoning before you even got a fourth of the way through it
14-11-2020T16:10:16,CrimsonQuill,I limit myself to once a week-two shots maximum.
14-11-2020T16:10:39,CrimsonQuill,"My saying is, ""If you've found your limit, you've had a drop too much""."
14-11-2020T16:10:42,AspiringNoodle,"my small binge period aside, I'm still doing like 1 beverage every 1 - 2 months, lol."
14-11-2020T16:10:53,Roughlandin,Last drink I've had was when I got a bottle of Stagg Jr a few weeks back
14-11-2020T16:11:03,CrimsonQuill,What's that like?
14-11-2020T16:11:08,Roughlandin,Darn good
14-11-2020T16:11:14,CrimsonQuill,"Neat"""
14-11-2020T16:11:18,Roughlandin,"Which it better be, because it AIN'T cheap"
14-11-2020T16:11:32,TheSexyBeast,Being poor helps my liver out
14-11-2020T16:11:35,CrimsonQuill,Neither is a Connemara whiskey...
14-11-2020T16:11:35,Rainelover,"He has over a hundred bottles of different brands of whisky, bourbon, and others, I know, I took the time to count them"
14-11-2020T16:11:47,CrimsonQuill,Good grief.
14-11-2020T16:11:53,CrimsonQuill,That'd keep me stocked for life..
14-11-2020T16:12:00,Ordithus,"That's a collection, not a stockpile"
14-11-2020T16:12:26,ZapiliDver,Simple vodka is the best imho.
14-11-2020T16:12:40,CrimsonQuill,Has anyone heard of Poiteen?
14-11-2020T16:13:01,AspiringNoodle,I've heard of poutine :D
14-11-2020T16:13:03,CrimsonQuill,"An Irish drink, which I believe is illegal."
14-11-2020T16:13:04,AspiringNoodle,I love me some poutine~
14-11-2020T16:13:05,TheSexyBeast,Not I
14-11-2020T16:13:08,Rainelover,"Luckily he’s not an alcoholic, he just tastes them in shot glasses every once in a while"
14-11-2020T16:13:08,Roughlandin,Basically the irish version of moonshine
14-11-2020T16:13:20,CrimsonQuill,It's made from potatoes and it's essentially Vodka up to 100.
14-11-2020T16:13:30,Roughlandin,So irish moonshine lol
14-11-2020T16:13:31,CrimsonQuill,It was often used to treat cattle.
14-11-2020T16:13:42,Roughlandin,I mean it's basically rubbing alcohol
14-11-2020T16:13:50,Rainelover,That’s the most Irish drink I’ve ever heard of
14-11-2020T16:13:57,CrimsonQuill,"@Roughlandin given how many stalls were found by the RIC before the war of independance, probably."
14-11-2020T16:14:33,Roughlandin,"Don't mess with shine, my friends"
14-11-2020T16:14:34,TheSexyBeast,RIC?
14-11-2020T16:14:47,Roughlandin,Royal Irish Constables
14-11-2020T16:14:59,Roughlandin,?
14-11-2020T16:15:12,Rainelover,"Who here supports a United ire- wait, no that’s political, never mind"
14-11-2020T16:15:18,CrimsonQuill,@Roughlandin Good to see someone who knows that history
14-11-2020T16:15:32,CrimsonQuill,@Rainelover That would tear the chat apart...
14-11-2020T16:15:44,Roughlandin,Well it worked well enough with Ireland
14-11-2020T16:16:07,CrimsonQuill,"Oh yes, very well...two years civil war, forty years of troubles and so fourth..."

14-11-2020T16:16:54,Roughlandin,Lol I am a history buff. Though I think the deepest dive I've taken into Irish history was listening to Zombie by the Cranberries while drinking a rocks glass of Redbreast
14-11-2020T16:16:59,Roughlandin,Hi Luna
14-11-2020T16:17:02,Rainelover,The Unionists would lose their fucking minds if that conversation was brought up
14-11-2020T16:17:34,TheSexyBeast,o/ Luna
14-11-2020T16:17:37,CrimsonQuill,@Roughlandin I recently read into the Magdalen laundries. I'd known about them but reading the full extent gave my faith in the church quite a dint...
14-11-2020T16:17:46,CrimsonQuill,But that's a darker time.
14-11-2020T16:17:49,CrimsonQuill,I hope.

14-11-2020T16:19:29,Rainelover,"I’m also technically friends with an Irish prince, since his last name is O’Rourke"
14-11-2020T16:19:59,CrimsonQuill,I see
14-11-2020T16:20:02,TheSexyBeast,Dot or feather Indian?

14-11-2020T16:21:10,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,"I have Irish, Spanish, Indian and British just from what I DO know"
14-11-2020T16:22:04,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,My grand pa was Irish and my grandma was Spanish
14-11-2020T16:22:40,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,The other two idk where they are from. Further back than that
14-11-2020T16:22:59,CrimsonQuill,"I think my great great grandfather was born in India, but he was British..."
14-11-2020T16:23:14,CrimsonQuill,"Freddie Mercurie was actually Parsi by birth, I believe."
14-11-2020T16:23:28,CrimsonQuill,Which goes a long way to explaining why he looked so handsome.
14-11-2020T16:23:29,Rainelover,"I’m also about 8 percent German, and I’m also part sub-Saharan African"
14-11-2020T16:23:32,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,Really?

14-11-2020T16:24:40,Ordithus,hi prose
14-11-2020T16:24:45,CrimsonQuill,And then it moved onto Vodka...
14-11-2020T16:24:52,CrimsonQuill,And then I mentioned Poiteen...
14-11-2020T16:24:53,ProsePro7,Ah
14-11-2020T16:25:06,CrimsonQuill,"And then it went on to Irish History, and from their to national ancestry..."
14-11-2020T16:25:17,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,It always starts with vodka somewhere
14-11-2020T16:25:18,CrimsonQuill,"So, I am mostly to blame for this."
14-11-2020T16:25:35,ZapiliDver,Vodka: the best way to start your epic journey.
14-11-2020T16:25:43,Ordithus,I'm just marveling at how my neighbor is struggling to move snow around

14-11-2020T16:28:16,InTheLionsDen,I will stick with poutine
14-11-2020T16:28:25,Roughlandin,When the choice is between politics and alcohol. Pick alcohol
14-11-2020T16:28:34,CrimsonQuill,Full circle revolution./
14-11-2020T16:28:43,TheSexyBeast,Politics suck.
14-11-2020T16:28:44,Rainelover,Why not both?
14-11-2020T16:28:55,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,That leads to death RL

14-11-2020T16:29:25,Roughlandin,Mixing politics and alcohol is why dueling was made illegal
14-11-2020T16:29:31,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,Yes
14-11-2020T16:29:50,Roughlandin,...Which I think is basically the entire plot of Hamilton
14-11-2020T16:29:54,CrimsonQuill,XD
14-11-2020T16:30:07,Rainelover,Stalin used alcohol to keep people drunk enough so that they wouldn’t think about how terrible their lives were
14-11-2020T16:30:08,ProsePro7,"Stage coach rules, no talking religion, politics, no gambling and if ya have liquor pass it around"

14-11-2020T16:31:16,Roughlandin,Deep water and large scary things. What Roughs hate the most

14-11-2020T16:42:00,Roughlandin,I've been watching UA out of context videos all weekend. It's weird that we don't have the context anymore

14-11-2020T16:47:42,Roughlandin,Yeah. At first when everyone went into quarantine I thought they should put it on hold and redo it later
14-11-2020T16:48:31,Roughlandin,But then I realized that was kind of the point. There are things in life you can't control. But that doesn't mean your life just stops. You have to live with the circumstances you're given and make the best of it

14-11-2020T18:42:06,RileyTheRiolu,Speaking of this Modern AU... It reminds me of my own world that I already established to you guys
14-11-2020T18:42:12,Dragusthor,yes cute
14-11-2020T18:42:30,RimaDraws,booper snoot
14-11-2020T18:42:41,BaskervilleNQH,There should be a wiki entry for the modern AU XD
14-11-2020T18:42:46,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,I would boop this cuties snoot

14-11-2020T18:43:19,BaskervilleNQH,The modern AU seems to be done purely through sketch and colour streams.
14-11-2020T18:43:24,RileyTheRiolu,I see
14-11-2020T18:43:26,CrimsonQuill,"boops Willow while everyone is arguing, and incurs the wrath of the wisp."
14-11-2020T18:43:32,Roughlandin,Modern AU is strictly sketchverse
14-11-2020T18:43:39,Roughlandin,...It's really cool though
14-11-2020T18:43:41,Katfeathers,The modern au developed in sketch suggestions
14-11-2020T18:43:41,BaskervilleNQH,Exactles.
14-11-2020T18:43:54,RileyTheRiolu,I hope one day it'll become a side project with TK happening
14-11-2020T18:43:56,Roughlandin,"Also, it MIGHT take place in the same continuity as Sam and Colin"
14-11-2020T18:43:56,BaskervilleNQH,It'd still be nice to have some kind of record of it.
14-11-2020T18:44:24,KeefMcDerpface,:eyes:

14-11-2020T18:45:16,Avolendi,Not for the faint of heart
14-11-2020T18:45:23,Roughlandin,"The only thing that's really been established in the Modern AU is that Kat and Laura are roommates, Nora is their cat, and Willow just moved in with them"
14-11-2020T18:45:29,RileyTheRiolu,"You know, I kinda feel bad to not to listen to the music on stream. I do have my own music I'm listening too, so I don't want to hear both."
14-11-2020T18:45:31,RileyTheRiolu,"Also, interesting"
14-11-2020T18:45:31,Katfeathers,includes the wisp in getting boops

14-11-2020T18:47:36,tehbear,Rought: that reminds my of Aggretsuko
14-11-2020T18:47:48,Roughlandin,"I would think that'd make physical attractiveness even MORE taboo, Shamus"
14-11-2020T18:48:02,Roughlandin,Bear! Now YOU'RE calling me Rought too?
14-11-2020T18:48:04,Katfeathers,"Willow's wisp being as it is, not sure what part got booped"
14-11-2020T18:48:13,Roughlandin,Ord! What have you done?!

14-11-2020T18:51:10,Roughlandin,I'm actually a Furby. Common misconception
14-11-2020T18:51:12,Katfeathers,electrostatically amps up the fluff past 9k

14-11-2020T18:52:25,Ordithus,Yee this is adorable
14-11-2020T18:52:32,CrimsonQuill,A quill is the barb of a feather.

14-11-2020T18:52:53,Roughlandin,use
14-11-2020T18:53:03,CrimsonQuill,"In history, pens would be made by taking a feather (usually a goose's) and the barbs taken off."
14-11-2020T18:53:12,CrimsonQuill,Hence a 'Quill' pen.
14-11-2020T18:53:23,RileyTheRiolu,"I know that, I thought it was something else though"
14-11-2020T18:53:29,CrimsonQuill,"Of course, for aesthetic reasons, we often see them with the quills left on."

14-11-2020T22:32:39,Roughlandin,Also Kat has baby fever
14-11-2020T22:32:49,ThingsAreMoving,:eyes: Anatomy lessons
14-11-2020T22:32:54,ShamusTheFox,Some interesting suggestions here.
14-11-2020T22:33:06,ThingsAreMoving,I remember suggesting something similar two years ago for halloween
14-11-2020T22:33:10,vevans0009,Kat went momma mode
14-11-2020T22:33:11,Ordithus,spooky skeletons ohno
14-11-2020T22:33:21,KeefMcDerpface,:ptv-shock:
14-11-2020T22:33:27,ThingsAreMoving,Never got traction but I would love to see keidran / basitin skeletons
14-11-2020T22:33:33,vevans0009,^
14-11-2020T22:33:33,Majyxs,Back to the Future reference fits ongoing music style.
14-11-2020T22:33:35,vevans0009,Dat be neat
14-11-2020T22:33:44,ProsePro7,Heres hoping this week
14-11-2020T22:33:44,GammaEradon,"Darn, is this the last round? Or is there one more after this? I have to go to bed soon and it looks like my suggestion might be on the very last round."
14-11-2020T22:33:47,Roughlandin,"I like ""Mike has a cute harem"" ...As though he doesn't already"
14-11-2020T22:33:50,ThingsAreMoving,For the looooooooore! :ctwokinds-nataniAAAAshake:
14-11-2020T22:33:53,Ordithus,"this is the last vote, gamma"
14-11-2020T22:33:53,Roughlandin,"This is the last round, Gamma"
14-11-2020T22:33:56,ShamusTheFox,"I like Natani awkwardly trying to seduce Keith. But some of the AU stuff is intriguing. Keith with Maddie, hmm."
14-11-2020T22:34:03,GammaEradon,"Huh, didn't see my suggestion then."
14-11-2020T22:34:08,ThingsAreMoving,what was yours?
14-11-2020T22:34:08,GammaEradon,Weird
14-11-2020T22:34:18,ProsePro7,Not mine but I will count it as a win if Harem Mike wins since I have a similar suggestion
14-11-2020T22:34:46,Ordithus,Did you have a sketch win last week? There's a cooldown period
14-11-2020T22:34:52,GammaEradon,"Aaaah, oh okay!"
14-11-2020T22:34:55,Roughlandin,Yep
14-11-2020T22:34:56,GammaEradon,That'd explain it
14-11-2020T22:35:02,ThingsAreMoving,one week
14-11-2020T22:35:06,GammaEradon,All good!
14-11-2020T22:35:12,GammaEradon,Just wanted to make sure.
14-11-2020T22:35:14,Roughlandin,I wondered the same thing when it happened to me the first time
14-11-2020T22:35:25,Roughlandin,Tom needs to make that clearer somewhere on the patreon
14-11-2020T22:35:32,Brocade,Mike as the protagonist of a harem anime would be the worst
14-11-2020T22:35:43,Brocade,he'd instantly lose every bit of self-confidence
14-11-2020T22:35:49,ProsePro7,@Ordithus I know but I havent had a win in months
14-11-2020T22:35:49,Roughlandin,It'd be too easy. Because everyone loves Mike
14-11-2020T22:35:56,ThingsAreMoving,Took me one and a half year to establish that the cooldown is indeed one week and not four like i presumed
