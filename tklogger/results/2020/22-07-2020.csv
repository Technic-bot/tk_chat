22-07-2020T00:11:34,AspiringNoodle,"Soooo, yesterday at work, somebody hydroplaned in the intersection near the store"
22-07-2020T00:11:53,AspiringNoodle,"Ended up jumping the curb, clearing a good amount of distance, and landed in our lot.  Blew both right tires."
22-07-2020T00:12:15,AspiringNoodle,"Somehow went between a tree and my car, but hit neither."
22-07-2020T00:12:30,CrRAR,Wow
22-07-2020T00:12:51,CrRAR,"Duke‚Äôs a‚Äôhazzar‚Äôd it, eh?"
22-07-2020T00:12:54,Ordithus,maybe don't drive 80 in the rain on bald tires
22-07-2020T00:13:25,CrRAR,But then how else are you supossed to time travel?
22-07-2020T00:13:26,AspiringNoodle,"One customer said they ran a red, dude said he was cut off, I didn't see it."
22-07-2020T00:13:45,AspiringNoodle,I'm just flabbergasted as to how he made it into the lot without hitting anything
22-07-2020T00:14:30,CrRAR,If you yeeeehaww loud enough
22-07-2020T00:14:41,CrRAR,It just works out like that

22-07-2020T14:10:34,CrRAR,(Mostly) good pomegrantes are in stores in the fall and winter months so timing isn‚Äôt the best

22-07-2020T18:41:21,Twokinds,More birthdays?
22-07-2020T18:42:06,Dadrobit,Folks got busy in October/November I guess?

22-07-2020T18:49:31,Twokinds,It seems the layer didn't make it

22-07-2020T18:50:33,Twokinds,My bad. It was censored for being too brutal
22-07-2020T18:50:42,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-reniderp: reni worked so hard for that gore
22-07-2020T18:51:04,Dadrobit,Rated R for gratuitous violence.
22-07-2020T18:51:07,Twokinds,btw are you guys satisfied with the number of votes you get for the color poll?
22-07-2020T18:51:34,Ordithus,Yeah.  Can't let us vote for everything.  Gotta make us actually choose
22-07-2020T18:51:47,Twokinds,"It used to be 3, now it's 5. I've even considered letting people vote for up to 7. Is more options better, or no?"
22-07-2020T18:52:27,Ordithus,I like 5 more than 3.  7 is probably too much - that's 1/3 of a typical month
22-07-2020T18:52:41,Twokinds,True
22-07-2020T18:52:47,Ordithus,But that's me
22-07-2020T18:53:11,Twokinds,"I sometimes wonder if people just pick something to get up to the max, and then a lot of people end up pushing their 7th place least wanted pick to the point where it ends up winning against ones that people really wanted"
22-07-2020T18:53:11,Dadrobit,5 for sure felt better than 3 for me as well.
22-07-2020T18:53:14,Twokinds,But I don't know
22-07-2020T18:53:20,SpazztasticKiwi,did you post a color vote
22-07-2020T18:53:29,Twokinds,I'm about it
22-07-2020T18:53:38,Twokinds,Just debating 5 vs 7
22-07-2020T18:53:45,SpazztasticKiwi,flip a coin
22-07-2020T18:54:00,SpazztasticKiwi,or think about the work cause you‚Äôll be the one that has to do it
22-07-2020T18:54:11,FloofyCat,I like 5.
22-07-2020T18:54:11,Twokinds,No extra work involved
22-07-2020T18:54:16,Twokinds,Either way
22-07-2020T18:54:22,Ordithus,5 is also good because that's how many you typically color
22-07-2020T18:55:24,Dadrobit,"Agreed, 7 would feel weird as a voter knowing that some of your votes are guaranteed to not win."
22-07-2020T18:55:30,FloofyCat,Personally I'd like a voting system like we have with tkpolls but honestly yeah that's a lot of work and not feasible with google surveys.
22-07-2020T18:56:03,Twokinds,But it almost means its less likely none of your votes will win
22-07-2020T18:56:20,Twokinds,Almost no one gets all 5 right
22-07-2020T18:56:22,Ordithus,learn to vote gud
22-07-2020T18:56:26,Dadrobit,Vote inflation
22-07-2020T18:56:35,FloofyCat,I suppose even if you get 7 votes you don't have to use the mall.
22-07-2020T18:56:37,FloofyCat,them all*
22-07-2020T18:56:39,Dadrobit,"More votes, each one becomes less valuable"
22-07-2020T18:56:48,Twokinds,True
22-07-2020T18:56:59,Twokinds,"For no, I'll stick with 5, I guess."
22-07-2020T18:57:18,Twokinds,"I did just increase it last month for 3, so maybe we'll stick with this for a while"
22-07-2020T18:57:20,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt always get to voting on time but when I do I usually don‚Äôt choose more than 3-5
22-07-2020T18:57:54,Ordithus,I always use them all for the color vote.  Make fewer good sketches
22-07-2020T18:58:11,FloofyCat,I usually always leave suggestions to the last minute because I can never make my mind up pfft
22-07-2020T18:58:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"because of it shall not be named tripping over itself for me, I have little clue what‚Äôs even up for vote"
22-07-2020T18:59:10,Dadrobit,"Almost never vote for more than 3-5 for sketch suggestions, but I definitely have to use all the color votes. Too many options there to not use them all."
22-07-2020T19:00:35,CrRAR,I feel like more votes would just lead to closer results.
22-07-2020T19:00:44,FloofyCat,I always vote when I can for Sunday streams.
22-07-2020T19:00:46,CrRAR,"Like more ties, maybe"
22-07-2020T19:01:13,FloofyCat,I used to miss a fair few because I kept getting night shifts on Sunday but ever since COVID I've been catching them all.
22-07-2020T19:01:41,AspiringNoodle,yay for extra strem time :D
22-07-2020T19:02:31,Twokinds,"Ok, color poll going up in a few minutes"

22-07-2020T19:03:21,CrRAR,"...trying out the 5 for a while is probably good, I feel like if it improves anything it makes the fringe candidates more competitive."
22-07-2020T19:03:36,Twokinds,"Man, I'm almost double and triple checking these things. I'm always paranoid I've left a sketch out"
22-07-2020T19:04:22,CrRAR,"Yeah, esp with doing the other sketch session sometimes I bet"

22-07-2020T22:11:52,AspiringNoodle,Tunnel building in minecraft feels claustrophobic...
22-07-2020T22:12:08,AspiringNoodle,"You *could* make a larger passage, but it would take so much time"
22-07-2020T22:12:39,AspiringNoodle,"Also, whose idea was it to make that tunnel from the portal to the base?"
22-07-2020T22:15:00,MoonDance,They are pretty passive. The blue warts lead them
22-07-2020T22:16:20,AspiringNoodle,"Mmmm, such a cozy room~"
