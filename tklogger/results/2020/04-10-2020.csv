04-10-2020T00:33:08,SpazztasticKiwi,this is of utmost urgency
04-10-2020T00:33:15,SpazztasticKiwi,has Kat ever had curly hair
04-10-2020T00:36:16,AspiringNoodle,I don't think she has
04-10-2020T00:36:39,steelabjur,"Watching the video of tonight's stream. Damn, it looks like I missed a good one."
04-10-2020T00:42:40,AspiringNoodle,I slept through half of it :c
04-10-2020T00:45:56,steelabjur,Aw. :(
04-10-2020T00:47:01,steelabjur,I kinda want a follow up of the Saria/Rose sketch. Makes me wish I could make suggestions.
04-10-2020T00:49:06,Dadrobit,"She was super floofy that one time, dunno if that's the kind of curly you're looking for though."
04-10-2020T00:57:49,CrRAR,"rima kinda drew her once with shorter curlish-y hair, but yeah not long swirly curls"
04-10-2020T01:24:57,SpazztasticKiwi,thing with curly hair is it’s longer
04-10-2020T01:25:06,SpazztasticKiwi,"if you straighten it, there’s more hair"
04-10-2020T01:25:39,SpazztasticKiwi,"so if her hair was curly at the length it is now, it could end up being a few inches shorter"
04-10-2020T01:51:16,SpazztasticKiwi,I feel the sleepies

04-10-2020T14:53:55,AspiringNoodle,"Just googled that, mmmm, looks tasty"
04-10-2020T15:14:06,CrimsonQuill,Hey guys?
04-10-2020T15:14:11,CrimsonQuill,I may have done a thing
04-10-2020T15:14:16,CrimsonQuill,alo back
04-10-2020T15:17:14,AspiringNoodle,My movie theater of choice is shutting back down
04-10-2020T15:18:08,CrimsonQuill,Cineworld?
04-10-2020T15:18:10,AspiringNoodle,"Oh well.  I have their subscription service (and I paid for it in full before the pandemic started), so going to see a movie costs me nothing but time and gas money, lol"
04-10-2020T15:18:19,AspiringNoodle,"Regal Cinemas, one of their brands :p"
04-10-2020T15:18:58,AspiringNoodle,"But as you can see, I still haven't gone back.  Shame, Tenet looked interesting, but not even a free large popcorn / soda for my belated birthday could drag me back."
04-10-2020T15:19:58,AspiringNoodle,"On the bright side, that means my subscription will be extended (again) by however long they stay closed.  Or the theater dies permanently and I just sub to streaming services :/"
04-10-2020T15:20:57,CrimsonQuill,"Theaters and the like are being hit very hard by the pandemic,"
04-10-2020T15:29:00,AspiringNoodle,"Not unsurprising.  Honestly, theaters have been shafted hard by the movie studios."
04-10-2020T15:29:17,AspiringNoodle,Not surprising*
04-10-2020T15:29:46,AspiringNoodle,The way ticket sales are split would kill movie theaters eventually.  They've had to get creative to stay afloat.
04-10-2020T15:30:18,AspiringNoodle,"More and more people are staying home from theaters thanks to the rise of streaming platforms, ever improving projects / television screens, home audio, etc."
04-10-2020T15:31:27,AspiringNoodle,"If you've ever complained about how expensive concessions are at the theaters, that's literally how they make most of their money."
04-10-2020T15:32:19,CrimsonQuill,Concessions?
04-10-2020T15:39:28,AspiringNoodle,drinks / food
04-10-2020T15:48:26,CrimsonQuill,Oh I see
04-10-2020T15:52:30,AspiringNoodle,Want a breakdown of how bad it is? xD
04-10-2020T15:55:17,CrimsonQuill,I would say yes
04-10-2020T15:55:23,CrimsonQuill,But today was a bit here and there
04-10-2020T15:55:44,CrimsonQuill,And I do not want to lie awake at night thinking about how cynical the world is
04-10-2020T15:55:51,CrimsonQuill,"Thanks, but no thanks"
04-10-2020T15:55:53,CrimsonQuill,Sorry
04-10-2020T16:05:53,AspiringNoodle,haha
04-10-2020T16:06:25,CrimsonQuill,"Besides, I'm already stewing in having spent the afternoon on Minecraft instead of Studying"
04-10-2020T16:19:16,AspiringNoodle,"Man, BFA has been a pretty crappy expansion, but I cannot overstate that the art team did an AMAZING job"
04-10-2020T16:19:54,AspiringNoodle,"And while the story itself has been kinda meh, the fact that they've pushed forward with cinematics so heavily has greatly enhanced their telling of the story"
04-10-2020T16:23:06,CrimsonQuill,"Just checked the links...Good grief, they're good."
04-10-2020T16:23:34,CrimsonQuill,I'm going to buy that song.
04-10-2020T16:24:57,SpazztasticKiwi,I got food and a seat
04-10-2020T16:25:33,CrimsonQuill,Hi Spazz
04-10-2020T16:26:06,CrimsonQuill,Did something I was always terrified of trying today
04-10-2020T16:27:11,AspiringNoodle,"HOpe you watched the in-game cinematic, haha"
04-10-2020T16:27:22,AspiringNoodle,Pretty sure that happens immediately after the Warbringer cinematic
04-10-2020T16:28:01,CrimsonQuill,"Not the cinematic, no, just the song"
04-10-2020T16:28:05,CrimsonQuill,I shall watch it now
04-10-2020T16:29:50,AspiringNoodle,"Starting in WoD, WoW started getting very cinematic in the game"
04-10-2020T16:29:55,AspiringNoodle,I approve
04-10-2020T16:30:00,CrimsonQuill,Just watched it. It's excellent.
04-10-2020T16:30:23,AspiringNoodle,"While some of the impact is lost if you don't know exactly what's going on and why, the stories are so goooooooood"
04-10-2020T16:30:41,CrimsonQuill,"Oh don't worry, my sister lectured me to death on the lore"
04-10-2020T16:30:57,CrimsonQuill,Most of which went in one ear and out the other ;)
04-10-2020T16:31:40,AspiringNoodle,One of the most impactful cinematics in the game
04-10-2020T16:34:31,CrimsonQuill,Good grief.
04-10-2020T16:34:36,CrimsonQuill,You said it.
04-10-2020T16:35:09,CrimsonQuill,I'm going to bed all

04-10-2020T21:10:54,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s literally the same voice and face on both side of the frame
04-10-2020T21:11:28,SpazztasticKiwi,robert has a scar over his left eyebrow where hair doesn’t grow - that’s the only immediate difference
