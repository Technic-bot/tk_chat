28-11-2020T00:10:37,AspiringNoodle,"Welp, better make 118 more.  You are a jewelry designer now"
28-11-2020T00:11:24,SpazztasticKiwi,"even a small pack of 5-10, maybe 50 if figure would be ok - so I‚Äôd have some spares, not a problem, maybe I‚Äôll get another idea"
28-11-2020T00:11:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"nah, least we got is 120, fam"
28-11-2020T00:12:02,AspiringNoodle,"""This is your life now.  Nothing but earring hooks."""

28-11-2020T13:57:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Mark donated those ~$500 of poptarts to a food bank according to his video
28-11-2020T13:58:10,SpazztasticKiwi,but he thinks strawberry is the worst flavor
28-11-2020T13:58:16,SpazztasticKiwi,what‚Äôs wrong with hime
28-11-2020T13:59:54,Ordithus,yeah they're all the worst flavor
28-11-2020T14:00:35,Twokinds,Blueberry is far superior
28-11-2020T14:04:41,AspiringNoodle,Blueberry is best flavor
28-11-2020T14:05:16,AspiringNoodle,...now I want blueberry poptarts...
28-11-2020T14:12:26,SpazztasticKiwi,blueberry is ok
28-11-2020T14:12:44,SpazztasticKiwi,and I‚Äôll take strawberry if the brown sugar isn‚Äôt available
28-11-2020T14:13:00,NezumiYuki,"While I love blue, and blueberries too, I would like to disagree.  Cherry and Strawberry Poptarts are where it's at!"
28-11-2020T14:13:28,NezumiYuki,Also those smore poptarts are yumm!
28-11-2020T14:13:49,SpazztasticKiwi,but calling strawberry the worst - yet redeeming himself by allotting that it‚Äôs better than those bastardized exotic flavors
28-11-2020T14:13:56,NezumiYuki,"That said, how are ya today, Tom?  :)"
28-11-2020T14:14:03,SpazztasticKiwi,dishonor
28-11-2020T14:14:15,SpazztasticKiwi,the s‚Äômores are ok until they make my stomach hurt
28-11-2020T14:18:00,SpazztasticKiwi,those who don‚Äôt toast their tarts or eat the unfrosted are apparently uncultured
28-11-2020T14:18:29,SpazztasticKiwi,if I had a conversation with this guy I have a feeling it‚Äôd be a fight about food
28-11-2020T14:23:42,NezumiYuki,"What I say next could be considered heretical but... I'll eat poptarts any which way.  Toasted, frozen, or right out of the box.  The toasted or frozen might not be considered heretical but I know most would say out of the box is heresy.  xD"
28-11-2020T14:25:30,Roughlandin,"Cherry, blueberry, brown sugar. Put em in my bear face."
28-11-2020T14:25:55,NezumiYuki,This rat loves those!  Gimme!
28-11-2020T14:26:19,SpazztasticKiwi,he thinks cherry is the best flavor
28-11-2020T14:26:31,Ordithus,they're all too sweet for my taste
28-11-2020T14:26:44,NezumiYuki,11/10 agrees with cherry poptarts being awesome
28-11-2020T14:26:55,Roughlandin,It's a toss up between cherry and blueberry for me. And they're more a snack/dessert than breakfast food
28-11-2020T14:27:29,SpazztasticKiwi,cherry is literally the default basic flavor to quality as fruity inclusive
28-11-2020T14:27:49,Roughlandin,Cherry is default poptart yis
28-11-2020T14:27:59,Roughlandin,I'm a cherry and vanilla kinda bear
28-11-2020T14:28:07,Roughlandin,Default suits me fine
28-11-2020T14:28:37,SpazztasticKiwi,when you get cherry anything you‚Äôre risking the scale of cough syrup or vaguely fruity like but could be cherry
28-11-2020T14:28:53,NezumiYuki,Now when it comes to Pillsbury Toaster Strudel... Apple is the way to go.
28-11-2020T14:29:25,SpazztasticKiwi,and you know out of all the flavors he tested
28-11-2020T14:29:35,SpazztasticKiwi,he didn‚Äôt try the brown sugar
28-11-2020T14:29:39,Roughlandin,"Cinnamon apple. And I know the box says strudel, but... c'mon... they're pies"
28-11-2020T14:29:53,Roughlandin,Wat? Brown sugar is a poptart classic
28-11-2020T14:29:54,SpazztasticKiwi,yep that‚Äôs what he said about them
28-11-2020T14:30:08,SpazztasticKiwi,apple pie but in flat form
28-11-2020T14:30:27,Roughlandin,Like a dessert hotpocket
28-11-2020T14:30:54,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôll snack on them but honestly all they are is a snack
28-11-2020T14:31:03,SpazztasticKiwi,they shouldn‚Äôt even be desserts
28-11-2020T14:31:05,Ordithus,I interrupt your strudels for this: tacos are amazing :cw0lfmare-Echolove:
28-11-2020T14:31:17,Roughlandin,There is... logic in what he says
28-11-2020T14:31:37,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôll definitely agree with him on they should not be for kids and definitely not marketed for kids
28-11-2020T14:32:22,SpazztasticKiwi,I should get up and get something like tacos
28-11-2020T14:32:36,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs 1:30 & I be hungry
28-11-2020T14:32:53,Roughlandin,"Al Pastor is life. Pork, pickled onion and pineapple relish. Throw some Chalula on top. Perfection."
28-11-2020T14:33:15,SpazztasticKiwi,none of that sounded appealing
28-11-2020T14:34:04,Roughlandin,Delish. And more traditional than most of the ground beef ones you get here state-side
28-11-2020T14:34:39,Ordithus,al pastor is good
28-11-2020T14:34:56,Roughlandin,I prefer carnita style tacos in general to beef
28-11-2020T14:35:41,SpazztasticKiwi,there‚Äôs got to be something I‚Äôm missing because I know you‚Äôre not talking about grilling up a religious leader and tossing him in a tortilla with the fixings
28-11-2020T14:36:11,Ordithus,or is he :cw0lfmare-PaperemberClose:
28-11-2020T14:36:11,Roughlandin,Carnita is a mexican style of pork roast
28-11-2020T14:36:27,Roughlandin,"Oh, Al Pastor lol"
28-11-2020T14:37:40,SpazztasticKiwi,https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/524825976597643265/782691650820505621/image0.jpg
28-11-2020T14:38:22,Roughlandin,...Why do I feel like I've passed this sign on the highway before?
28-11-2020T14:38:34,SpazztasticKiwi,cherry is better than strawberry is unholy if anything
28-11-2020T14:38:36,Ordithus,al pastor is rough's lucha costume
28-11-2020T14:39:09,Roughlandin,"Lol! I am Rough ""Al Pastor"" Landin!"
28-11-2020T14:39:45,Roughlandin,I jump into the ring and beat people over the head with a big pork roast
28-11-2020T14:39:51,SpazztasticKiwi,but you said you‚Äôre a bear
28-11-2020T14:40:01,Roughlandin,Hence the mask
28-11-2020T14:40:14,Ordithus,who ever said a bear can't be a pastor
28-11-2020T14:40:15,Roughlandin,If I was discovered... they'd kick me out of the league!
28-11-2020T14:40:21,Roughlandin,And the church!
28-11-2020T14:40:28,Roughlandin,Dios Mio!
28-11-2020T14:40:35,AspiringNoodle,"For some reason, I can't stop imagining pop-tart desert tacos"
28-11-2020T14:40:45,AspiringNoodle,Like... if choco tacos and pop-tarts had a baby.
28-11-2020T14:40:50,Roughlandin,Just fold one in half
28-11-2020T14:40:52,SpazztasticKiwi,thanks to unus annus I remember that borderline bondage video whenever I see bear
28-11-2020T14:40:52,AspiringNoodle,"A delicious, sickeningly sweet baby"
28-11-2020T14:41:02,Ordithus,:cw0lfmare-VivianPanic:
28-11-2020T14:41:16,Roughlandin,The one with this swing or the one where they made breakfast?
28-11-2020T14:41:21,Ordithus,I didn't see that one I should go oh wait
28-11-2020T14:41:37,Roughlandin,Actually I think the swing was a Markiplier Makes episode. Tyler was in it at least
28-11-2020T14:42:03,SpazztasticKiwi,it was
28-11-2020T14:42:18,SpazztasticKiwi,there‚Äôs a meme I‚Äôll show you about that video if I can find it later
28-11-2020T14:42:22,SpazztasticKiwi,it was nothing but Ethan demonstrating various knots
28-11-2020T14:42:26,SpazztasticKiwi,...on mark
28-11-2020T14:42:37,SpazztasticKiwi,uncomfortable eye contact the entire time
28-11-2020T14:42:40,Roughlandin,He just wanted to test his body's limits
28-11-2020T14:43:19,SpazztasticKiwi,the first breakfast one was cool
28-11-2020T14:43:46,Roughlandin,The part where that random guy comes to the door was the most hilarious thing from the series for me.
28-11-2020T14:43:51,Roughlandin,And that was the first episode
28-11-2020T14:44:10,SpazztasticKiwi,funny enough at least - I question what the workers of that shop were thinking when they bought all that & what they did with it all (though I bet it was all just put in storage)
28-11-2020T14:44:50,Roughlandin,Oh I doubt that was the strangest transaction that store clerk dealt with... probably not even that day
28-11-2020T14:44:58,SpazztasticKiwi,the only unus annus swing episode I remember is when mark broke his nose
28-11-2020T14:45:00,SpazztasticKiwi,again
28-11-2020T14:45:49,Roughlandin,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6Bjr6l5aNY
28-11-2020T14:46:00,Roughlandin,Not the original video but the general gist of it
28-11-2020T14:46:01,Ordithus,did he go to the hospital for that?
28-11-2020T14:46:20,Roughlandin,Lol
28-11-2020T14:46:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt thinks so
28-11-2020T14:46:46,Roughlandin,I think he green screened his head onto a picture of him from when he had that surgeru
28-11-2020T14:46:49,Roughlandin,surgery
28-11-2020T14:46:54,SpazztasticKiwi,after popping himself in the nose with the ring while upside down (his foot slipped)
28-11-2020T14:47:07,SpazztasticKiwi,he went on with the video
28-11-2020T14:47:08,Roughlandin,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onSQH_90jyo
28-11-2020T14:47:14,Roughlandin,"This, Ord?"
28-11-2020T14:47:33,SpazztasticKiwi,like his nose wasn‚Äôt slowly dripping blood
28-11-2020T14:47:38,Ordithus,"ah, I hadn't actually watched that"
28-11-2020T14:47:48,SpazztasticKiwi,and his face wasn‚Äôt going red to purple
28-11-2020T14:47:54,Ordithus,from the thumbnail it's pretty convincing
28-11-2020T14:47:55,Roughlandin,The effect is actually pretty good until he moves his head haha
28-11-2020T14:48:11,SpazztasticKiwi,"you‚Äôre obviously in pain, forget the video and go to a dr man"
28-11-2020T14:48:26,Roughlandin,Pain is just how Mark finds his limits
28-11-2020T14:49:15,SpazztasticKiwi,his ‚Äúact casual‚Äù wasn‚Äôt convincing
28-11-2020T14:50:02,Roughlandin,Why do I feel like that's how he handled all the times him and Tom got hurt messing around as kids?
28-11-2020T14:50:13,Roughlandin,"""Act casual. Don't let mom know."""
28-11-2020T14:51:03,SpazztasticKiwi,he once told the story how he found out hot oil and water don‚Äôt mix
28-11-2020T14:51:09,Roughlandin,pffft
28-11-2020T14:51:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm honestly surprised he‚Äôs still alive at this point
28-11-2020T14:51:41,Roughlandin,Sounds about like the time my sister tried to microwave a potato with the tinfoil still on
28-11-2020T14:53:06,SpazztasticKiwi,"according to his story, he wanted fried chicken"
28-11-2020T14:53:56,SpazztasticKiwi,"so he gets the oil and starts it up but he dropped something in it , the thermometer or something so he‚Äôs like ‚ÄúI gotta dump this now‚Äù"
28-11-2020T14:54:18,SpazztasticKiwi,but you can‚Äôt dump hot oil so ‚ÄúILL JUST POUR SOME WATER ON IT AND COOL IT DOWN‚Äù
28-11-2020T14:54:36,Roughlandin,Yeaaaaah no
28-11-2020T14:54:54,Roughlandin,How on fire was the kitchen?
28-11-2020T14:55:24,SpazztasticKiwi,"and then he‚Äôs screaming through the house, I don‚Äôt remember but I think he says he runs by the door where Tom is to get the phone or get help, something"
28-11-2020T14:55:44,SpazztasticKiwi,and Tom‚Äôs rushing up and all he hears is Marks Doppler effect scream
28-11-2020T14:55:49,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúI burned my hands‚Äù
28-11-2020T14:56:06,Ordithus,:fire::ctwokinds-nataniAAAAshake:
28-11-2020T14:56:38,Roughlandin,What are big brother's for if not saving the house from burning down?
28-11-2020T14:56:47,AspiringNoodle,xD
28-11-2020T14:56:52,AspiringNoodle,Tom is clearly the responsible one

28-11-2020T14:57:00,NezumiYuki,I don't wanna say that Mark is danger prone but...
28-11-2020T14:57:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Mark is literally a walking accident
28-11-2020T14:57:31,SpazztasticKiwi,"first of all, he wasn‚Äôt planned"

28-11-2020T14:57:38,SpazztasticKiwi,& it‚Äôs gone downhill from there

28-11-2020T14:58:49,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs not that bad - he‚Äôs joke it before
28-11-2020T14:58:52,Roughlandin,All that matters is Momiplier loves him and wouldn't have it any other way
28-11-2020T14:59:26,NezumiYuki,Mominplier is GOLDEN!  Looking after both Tommy and Markie like that!
28-11-2020T14:59:43,Roughlandin,She even got to help him experience what the joy of childbirth feels like. That was one of the... weirder UA videos

28-11-2020T15:11:56,Roughlandin,Our big thing was getting the christmas village up. It takes up two corners of the kitchen and has now spilled into the living room

28-11-2020T15:15:51,Roughlandin,"Yeah, might as well. Nothing else to do in January/February"

28-11-2020T15:45:33,SpazztasticKiwi,nononono
28-11-2020T15:45:49,SpazztasticKiwi,years ago I saw a weeeee baby deer with a white butt
28-11-2020T15:46:02,SpazztasticKiwi,but the rest of it was normal deer color
28-11-2020T15:46:08,NezumiYuki,ahhh
28-11-2020T15:46:25,Ordithus,more white than a whitetail deer?
28-11-2020T15:46:29,SpazztasticKiwi,either the deer around here are mutating in not so survival savvy ways or it‚Äôs the same deer
28-11-2020T15:46:46,SpazztasticKiwi,but it looks like the white has spread
28-11-2020T15:47:00,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hey Hey o/
28-11-2020T15:47:08,NezumiYuki,Hey Marv
28-11-2020T15:47:09,Ordithus,hi again marv
28-11-2020T15:47:17,SpazztasticKiwi,the butt and hip area was white when I saw it - possibly a she because I see no hint of antlers
28-11-2020T15:47:19,Snowmanwizard,hi Marv
28-11-2020T15:47:49,SpazztasticKiwi,but this older version has that white and what looks like spots starting to help the white creep up its body
28-11-2020T15:48:01,Sammit,Hi everybody
28-11-2020T15:48:08,Ordithus,hi sammit

28-11-2020T15:48:22,Ordithus,"so like, this deer is slowly turning white all over?"
28-11-2020T15:48:22,SpazztasticKiwi,it might have vitiligo
28-11-2020T15:48:30,Roughlandin,So it's piebald?
28-11-2020T15:48:35,Sammit,"Hi Ord, Snowman, Marv, Kiwi and Rough"
28-11-2020T15:48:52,NezumiYuki,:wave: @Sammit
28-11-2020T15:48:57,SpazztasticKiwi,also when I first saw this deer I named him Sppoky Butt

28-11-2020T15:49:07,Roughlandin,Like a that
28-11-2020T15:49:21,SpazztasticKiwi,YES
28-11-2020T15:49:24,Roughlandin,Oh neat
28-11-2020T15:49:35,Roughlandin,That's a pretty rare mutation
28-11-2020T15:49:44,SpazztasticKiwi,but the white spread that picture shows was flipped
28-11-2020T15:49:49,SpazztasticKiwi,more on the back than the belly
28-11-2020T15:50:08,Roughlandin,The pattern can vary
28-11-2020T15:50:25,SpazztasticKiwi,his - now a her as it seem there doth be no antlers - name is Spooky Butt
28-11-2020T15:50:30,Snowmanwizard,"area i work has piebald deer all over the place, 3 complete albinos"
28-11-2020T15:50:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Spooky Butt is alive
28-11-2020T15:50:46,Ordithus,don't think I've ever seen one of those in the wild
28-11-2020T15:50:57,NezumiYuki,Such a white butt is likely to be similar to Flora... Very visible and a means to gather Trace's attention.
28-11-2020T15:51:10,SpazztasticKiwi,I will get a picture of this sucker if it kills me
28-11-2020T15:51:21,Ordithus,a worthy cause
28-11-2020T15:51:23,Roughlandin,"Good luck, kiwi!"
28-11-2020T15:51:48,SpazztasticKiwi,this is probably the third time I‚Äôve seen it again since I saw it as a baby with its mom
28-11-2020T15:51:49,TheSexyBeast,Hey all o/
28-11-2020T15:51:57,Roughlandin,Heya beast
28-11-2020T15:52:23,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs so much farther than where it was though that I wonder if it is a different deer
28-11-2020T15:52:53,Sammit,Hi Beast
28-11-2020T15:53:21,TheSexyBeast,"Hey Rough, Sam"
28-11-2020T15:53:54,Roughlandin,"Maybe, Kiwi. The article I'm reading says it affects about 2% of the US deer population"
28-11-2020T15:54:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I saw it as a baby on my property and this adult is much farther down the road
28-11-2020T15:54:43,Roughlandin,Eh probably the same one. Deer range pretty far through the season
28-11-2020T15:54:48,SpazztasticKiwi,add to that I‚Äôve seen the adult version on my property before a year or two after seeing the baby and before I saw this adult
28-11-2020T15:55:02,SpazztasticKiwi,it needs to stay on my property though
28-11-2020T15:55:16,Ordithus,hi sexy

28-11-2020T16:30:47,Roughlandin,o/ Prose
28-11-2020T16:31:05,GammaEradon,What were the benefits/rewards of the Nora Card level of support? I'm having trouble finding the different tiers on Tom's patreon
28-11-2020T16:31:07,PalmettoPathfinder1,"@Rouglandin I know.  Still, wished that Adelaide's ref sheet had gotten colored.  It was so very close to getting colored."
28-11-2020T16:31:09,unsteddyphoenix,oh not preinked. lie the good ol' days~
28-11-2020T16:31:13,TeapotOfDoom,that face is
28-11-2020T16:31:17,iliar,"Well, since you are rushing me, I will remind you that I used the Nora Card and asked you to color the sketch with Nora for my birthday. My birthday was June 22nd. You still haven't finished the line."
28-11-2020T16:31:17,TeapotOfDoom,revealing
28-11-2020T16:31:20,Ordithus,:cw0lfmare-Emberboop:
28-11-2020T16:31:21,Roughlandin,"Nora Card isn't there anymore, Gamma"
28-11-2020T16:31:27,Dimensional,Sadly $500 is way to much for me each month. Could go up to $50 each month for only 1 Nora card a year.
28-11-2020T16:31:29,CrRAR,You get to pick a sketch to be finished gamma
28-11-2020T16:31:34,unsteddyphoenix,isnt it lol
28-11-2020T16:31:55,unsteddyphoenix,totally not lewd at all~
28-11-2020T16:31:56,iliar,I've already resigned myself to the idea that you will finish this sketch by my next birthday ...
28-11-2020T16:31:57,GammaEradon,Aaaah. Gotcha.
28-11-2020T16:32:04,Ordithus,"where did this 500 come from? it was 200, I don't remember Tom talking much about how he'll bring it back"
28-11-2020T16:32:07,Roughlandin,Yeah that's it. It's the same as the $10 perks but you get a guaranteed colored sketch of your choice
28-11-2020T16:32:13,Ordithus,just that he will bring it back
28-11-2020T16:32:15,ThingsAreMoving,Someone randomly inserted 500
28-11-2020T16:32:20,ThingsAreMoving,it was 200
28-11-2020T16:32:34,unsteddyphoenix,which sketch iliar?
28-11-2020T16:32:37,Ordithus,"wholesomely lewd, teddy"
28-11-2020T16:32:45,Roughlandin,I said he might increase the price to keep the workload down. Don't know where 500 came from
28-11-2020T16:33:11,Grip,Hello :)

28-11-2020T16:33:26,ShamusTheFox,This feels like it will be a while in the inking. It also feels like it will be totally worth it.
28-11-2020T16:33:29,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Okay, so @TwoKinds what is the price going to be for Nora Cards.  We got prices flying all over the place."
28-11-2020T16:33:29,TeapotOfDoom,hi grip
28-11-2020T16:33:31,iliar,This is a secret sketch that has not been published
28-11-2020T16:33:33,Roughlandin,...Yeah you're probably right
28-11-2020T16:33:37,unsteddyphoenix,if we all ssume its 500 anyway might as wel make it 500~
28-11-2020T16:33:39,Twokinds,I don't intend to raise the price.
28-11-2020T16:33:45,Roughlandin,200 it is
28-11-2020T16:33:49,PalmettoPathfinder1,Tom has spoken!

28-11-2020T16:33:55,GammaEradon,"Neat, I can probably manage that"
28-11-2020T16:33:56,Dimensional,Darn. Still a bit too much for me to afford.
28-11-2020T16:33:58,PalmettoPathfinder1,$200 is manageable.
28-11-2020T16:34:05,PalmettoPathfinder1,Barely

28-11-2020T16:47:57,Roughlandin,Also maybe everyone assumed it would get top vote so... nobody voted on it
28-11-2020T16:47:58,ShamusTheFox,I am surprised no Jenny pics made it.

28-11-2020T18:22:51,Roughlandin,Sigh
28-11-2020T18:23:04,ZapiliDver,"Maine, sometimes guillotine can fix all, but it's not recommended for frequent usage."
28-11-2020T18:23:15,Avolendi,"... That might make you sweat more, so be less hydrated?"
28-11-2020T18:23:24,FreelancerAgentMaine,"Yeah, well im really dumb"
28-11-2020T18:23:30,Avolendi,Thus learning now?
28-11-2020T18:23:38,FreelancerAgentMaine,Like really really dum
28-11-2020T18:23:48,Roughlandin,To go on a tangent (Back to the art)... Tom has gotten really good a these low light angle pics!
28-11-2020T18:23:48,BaskervilleNQH,really digging the 'disbelief/happiness' on Mikes face.
28-11-2020T18:23:55,FreelancerAgentMaine,Like caboose from red vs blue dum
28-11-2020T18:24:00,BaskervilleNQH,It's a cool mix thats kinda hard for me to nail down
28-11-2020T18:24:15,Roughlandin,He's really good at expressions too lol
28-11-2020T18:24:21,Avolendi,It's really a nice expression yeah
28-11-2020T18:24:29,Ordithus,It was a very good night
28-11-2020T18:24:39,Roughlandin,About to be a good morning too
28-11-2020T18:24:43,Roughlandin,...Wait
28-11-2020T18:24:45,FreelancerAgentMaine,Its a pretty good morning too
28-11-2020T18:24:53,FreelancerAgentMaine,For me and them
28-11-2020T18:25:00,Roughlandin,...Was this secretly a Good Morning sketch in disguise?
28-11-2020T18:25:07,Avolendi,Probably
28-11-2020T18:25:09,Roughlandin,We've been bamboozled!
28-11-2020T18:25:09,NezumiYuki,"To me, this expression looks like Michelle's ""More please!"" face"
28-11-2020T18:25:10,Sammit,"to reduce the absorption rate of alchohol is good to eat a bit of oil or fat, also can help to wash down peppers"
28-11-2020T18:25:14,FreelancerAgentMaine,Indeed
28-11-2020T18:25:17,ZapiliDver,"Maine, also try sone sorbents or activated charcoal tablets"
28-11-2020T18:25:18,steelabjur,Good Morning VVM
28-11-2020T18:25:36,ProsePro7,Drink water too.  One for one when drinking
28-11-2020T18:25:38,Roughlandin,"At this point, maybe try a stomach pump"
28-11-2020T18:25:55,FreelancerAgentMaine,"Dunno what that is, you want me to eat charcoal from my grill?"
28-11-2020T18:26:08,FreelancerAgentMaine,Ill do it
28-11-2020T18:26:14,ZapiliDver,"Nope, tablets from store"
28-11-2020T18:26:20,Roughlandin,Activated charcoal tabs. It's what they give people with alcohol poisoning
28-11-2020T18:26:23,FreelancerAgentMaine,I cant drive
28-11-2020T18:26:27,Avolendi,There's tablets that are charcoal which help. Not sure how safe literal charcoal from a fire is
28-11-2020T18:26:31,Roughlandin,Please don't try
28-11-2020T18:26:33,Ordithus,Not at all
28-11-2020T18:26:37,steelabjur,"Nah, you can get tablets of activated charcoal."
28-11-2020T18:26:38,FreelancerAgentMaine,Or at least i shouldn't
28-11-2020T18:26:44,Roughlandin,Don't
28-11-2020T18:26:46,Ordithus,And do not
28-11-2020T18:27:08,Sammit,"charcoal from the grill or ashes is better if you are too desperate and is near poisioning level, better avoid it"
28-11-2020T18:27:10,steelabjur,No drivey!
28-11-2020T18:27:14,ThingsAreMoving,Hangover cure is a myth. You need to hydrate and give your body some sugars and electrolytes
28-11-2020T18:27:20,FreelancerAgentMaine,Dont worry i only ever put my life in danger never others
28-11-2020T18:27:23,Ordithus,"Maine, your drunken antics have been derailing chat for a while. Take care of yourself. Any more and I'll have to give you a break from here."
28-11-2020T18:27:24,Avolendi,"If it's really bad, simplest might be to hang over a toilet and let it go back. Feels like crap, but if it's bad that might be for the best"
28-11-2020T18:27:25,ThingsAreMoving,And time to process
28-11-2020T18:27:29,ProsePro7,I love this song makes me think of 16 bit nintendo

28-11-2020T18:28:24,ZapiliDver,Best way is to keep some enterosorbenst for future hangover.
28-11-2020T18:28:38,steelabjur,"Time to make dinner, I'll be afk (more so than usual ;p)"

28-11-2020T21:04:07,bookvee,It says in a story crafting manual I bought a few years back that the way to make a plot interesting is to have quiet periods as well as drama. So many writers will just pile on more drama when people start to get bored.

28-11-2020T22:42:18,CrRAR,Like a bike handlebar gyro?

28-11-2020T22:47:44,CrRAR,That‚Äôs a much more reasonable amount
28-11-2020T22:48:03,SpazztasticKiwi,it was also while waiting for the chicken that I got distracted by the angel tree
28-11-2020T22:49:07,SpazztasticKiwi,somebody should tell God there‚Äôs easier ways to get me to do charity
28-11-2020T22:50:17,CrRAR,Is an angel tree a thing where you pick a gift to buy for a child or animal?
28-11-2020T22:50:24,SpazztasticKiwi,yeah

28-11-2020T22:52:43,SpazztasticKiwi,I have donated money or got something that had profits going to charity - the ladder is what I do most
28-11-2020T22:52:58,SpazztasticKiwi,but I prefer more direct ways sometimes
28-11-2020T22:53:31,SpazztasticKiwi,I remember when I used to be able to spend time at those facilities wrapping those kinds of presents for the kids involved
28-11-2020T22:54:02,SpazztasticKiwi,or helping at the homeless thanksgiving dinner kitchen
28-11-2020T22:54:16,Ordithus,that's awesome
28-11-2020T22:54:17,CrRAR,awww

28-11-2020T22:55:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I used to actually do more than give money

28-11-2020T22:59:02,SpazztasticKiwi,the most memorable kid was maybe the one I picked  - it was a six year old girl who had ‚Äúmermaids‚Äù listed on the back for her interests

28-11-2020T23:33:24,CrRAR,Is it pretty like the Rainbow Fish in that kid book?
28-11-2020T23:34:39,SpazztasticKiwi,idunno man https://www.walmart.com/ip/Barbie-Dreamtopia-Sparkle-Lights-Mermaid-with-Blonde-Pink-Hair/483217525
28-11-2020T23:34:43,SpazztasticKiwi,you look
28-11-2020T23:35:06,CrRAR,aw wow
28-11-2020T23:35:21,SpazztasticKiwi,unus annus had a challenge last year - you know the only chance they had at Christmas
28-11-2020T23:35:41,Ordithus,"woah, when did barbie get not ridiculous"
28-11-2020T23:36:08,CrRAR,"When she became a fish, apparently"
28-11-2020T23:36:14,SpazztasticKiwi,"to do a nice thing & share it, that was the video with Se√°n where they bought all those toys and donated it"
28-11-2020T23:36:37,Ordithus,cool
28-11-2020T23:36:45,Ordithus,I'll go watc- oh
28-11-2020T23:37:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"same thing could apply to the angel tree - if every fan picked one to buy for, that‚Äôd be a pretty big movement"
28-11-2020T23:37:48,SpazztasticKiwi,and it‚Äôd still be buying toys for kids
28-11-2020T23:38:30,SpazztasticKiwi,that‚Äôs what some of the people that they featured later in the video did
28-11-2020T23:39:29,SpazztasticKiwi,barbie had the mermaid thing way back when I was a kid
28-11-2020T23:39:54,Ordithus,proportions is what i meant
28-11-2020T23:40:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"dreamtopia‚Äôs been around for about as long, like fairytopia"
28-11-2020T23:40:22,SpazztasticKiwi,oh that happened something something years ago
28-11-2020T23:40:45,CrRAR,lol ord
28-11-2020T23:40:55,SpazztasticKiwi,"the unrealistic, impossible thing finally got noticed enough that they redesigned her shape"
28-11-2020T23:40:57,CrRAR,it would be ironic
28-11-2020T23:41:07,CrRAR,>become mythical creature
28-11-2020T23:41:17,CrRAR,>realistic proportions
28-11-2020T23:41:39,SpazztasticKiwi,"she‚Äôs still slim but there‚Äôs more forms out there - shorter, wider hips, wider torso"
28-11-2020T23:41:53,CrRAR,Yeah I remember that whole body image controversy thing
28-11-2020T23:41:55,SpazztasticKiwi,theres a wheelchair barbie and more skin tones
28-11-2020T23:42:29,CrRAR,Probably like 15 years ago or more now
28-11-2020T23:42:33,Ordithus,"years ago I saw something on how ridiculous the proportions were, and how barbie would be dead"
28-11-2020T23:42:39,SpazztasticKiwi,they even made her mermaid tail thicker to account for more sensible muscle if she were a fish
28-11-2020T23:43:06,SpazztasticKiwi,yeah barbie and most girl dolls would be dead if put on earth
28-11-2020T23:44:13,SpazztasticKiwi,"it‚Äôs a problem with equestria girls and monster high and ever after high, so on and so forth"
28-11-2020T23:44:45,SpazztasticKiwi,some characters are slightly shorter or taller than the average main character but a the girls are generally the same shape
28-11-2020T23:45:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"if you had a monster high body, you‚Äôd be dead"
28-11-2020T23:48:27,CrRAR,"undead, series appropriate"
28-11-2020T23:49:09,CrRAR,"So for that franchise, the unrealistic proportions is really just meta-self awareness"
28-11-2020T23:49:14,AspiringNoodle,https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/smallest-waist-living-person
28-11-2020T23:49:21,AspiringNoodle,Your move :ptv-laugh:
28-11-2020T23:49:41,Ordithus,dafuq
28-11-2020T23:49:41,CrRAR,Nnnuuuu not the crazy corset rib removal ladyyyy
28-11-2020T23:50:31,Ordithus,that ain't right
28-11-2020T23:50:37,KeefMcDerpface,:ptv-confused:
28-11-2020T23:50:47,Ordithus,:cw0lfmare-EmberHide: my life was better before I knew this
28-11-2020T23:51:20,CrRAR,"That‚Äôs not even an accomplishment, it‚Äôs a unhealthy obsession"
28-11-2020T23:51:37,Ordithus,how does she not just break into two
28-11-2020T23:51:40,AspiringNoodle,"""Literally our defining feature."" -Guinness, probably"
28-11-2020T23:52:16,AspiringNoodle,One does not simply get into the book of world records
28-11-2020T23:57:11,SpazztasticKiwi,the important thing to not is that‚Äôs not natural
28-11-2020T23:57:20,Dadrobit,My new sister in law wears corsets. I do not understand the appeal.
28-11-2020T23:57:32,Dadrobit,She's already fairly skinny.
28-11-2020T23:57:51,SpazztasticKiwi,people say the same about me
28-11-2020T23:58:05,Dadrobit,And I suspect her screwing with your core muscles like that is not great long term.
28-11-2020T23:58:10,SpazztasticKiwi,but we see more than the public does
28-11-2020T23:58:54,SpazztasticKiwi,and it‚Äôs never good enough compared to what‚Äôs popular
28-11-2020T23:59:39,SpazztasticKiwi,corsets are an imperfect girl‚Äôs friend
