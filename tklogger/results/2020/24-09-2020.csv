24-09-2020T13:04:31,AspiringNoodle,"I feel like this is a perfect example of a Puritan meeting ANY other kind of social group, lmao."
24-09-2020T13:12:11,K3IDRAN,So Microsoft just bought Zenimax
24-09-2020T13:13:09,K3IDRAN,We might see sn Oblivion Special. Edition
24-09-2020T13:13:17,K3IDRAN,An
24-09-2020T13:13:28,TerraTheWizard,[x] doubt
24-09-2020T13:15:09,K3IDRAN,New Vegas 2? since MS also owns Obsidian
24-09-2020T13:17:13,K3IDRAN,If that got announced Tom would go nuts
24-09-2020T13:17:31,AspiringNoodle,"That's the biggest piece of speculation.  Since MS now owns both studios, NV2 is a real possibility"
24-09-2020T13:17:57,AspiringNoodle,"And I'm all for it, since NV is arguably the best Fall Out game in the series since it was made by the studio who actually knows what they're doing, lol"
24-09-2020T13:18:20,AspiringNoodle,"Also, would probably piss off the executive heads at Bethesda since they screwed Obsidian out of their bonuses."
24-09-2020T13:19:05,K3IDRAN,Lol it's Microsoft
24-09-2020T13:20:16,K3IDRAN,They don't care if a few Executives heads throws a fit
24-09-2020T13:22:57,K3IDRAN,Imagine. F4 was made by Obsidian
24-09-2020T13:28:55,AspiringNoodle,"Tbh, this is probably the best thing that could happen to Bethesda.  Their execs are stupidly incompetent (I'M LOOKING AT YOU, TODD HOWARD)"
24-09-2020T13:29:24,AspiringNoodle,Their game engine is freaking ANCIENT.  This is coming from a guy who's played World of Warcraft since 2006.  I'm well aware of the game's limitations.
24-09-2020T13:29:55,AspiringNoodle,"They need to upgrade their infrastructure for games moving forward.  If they don't, it'll hold back their graphics, and there games will continue to be bugged to high heaven."
24-09-2020T13:35:19,K3IDRAN,Yeap
24-09-2020T13:35:32,K3IDRAN,Their really is s god
24-09-2020T13:37:21,K3IDRAN,If this didn't happen to them Elder Scrolls. VI would If been buggy as fuck
24-09-2020T13:38:39,K3IDRAN,Tom should come back to The Elder Scrolls now tbh
24-09-2020T13:41:23,AspiringNoodle,Probably still will be
24-09-2020T13:41:50,AspiringNoodle,"ES6 and their new venture, Starfield, are supposed to be made with their current game engine"
24-09-2020T13:42:13,AspiringNoodle,"So unless Microsoft intervenes, it'll be after those games that they finally are forced to upgrade."

24-09-2020T16:46:31,AspiringNoodle,I feel bad for my manager.  Don't think he's yet realized how badly understaffed the store is.
24-09-2020T16:46:40,AspiringNoodle,Been like half a year or more.
24-09-2020T16:47:54,AspiringNoodle,Store legitimately can't find good people to hold onto.
24-09-2020T16:48:26,AspiringNoodle,"And even then, it's following the good ol' death spiral."

24-09-2020T18:16:56,Ordithus,"ham, and it'll be simple and lazy"
24-09-2020T18:17:24,K3IDRAN,I'm planning on getting a Laptop since hy Windows 10 hard drive wifi is dead
24-09-2020T18:17:28,K3IDRAN,My
24-09-2020T18:19:43,AspiringNoodle,I'm married to my desktop :ptv-laugh:
24-09-2020T18:19:58,Ordithus,:ptv-shipit:
24-09-2020T18:20:19,AspiringNoodle,"Laptops are stupidly convenient, but to get the same power as a desktop, they'll need to be stupidly thicc / heavy to fit cooling"
24-09-2020T18:20:44,AspiringNoodle,"And on top of that, you'll need to lug power bricks or plug them into a wall for heavy workloads."
24-09-2020T18:20:47,AspiringNoodle,And the cost...
24-09-2020T18:21:12,Ordithus,"desktop for when you need the power, laptop for when you don't want to be tied to the desk"
24-09-2020T18:21:33,Ordithus,having both is nice
24-09-2020T18:21:51,AspiringNoodle,"Yeah, but I'll be sticking with desktop for now :ptv-laugh:"
24-09-2020T18:22:19,Ordithus,harder to travel with a desktop
24-09-2020T18:22:23,Ordithus,not that's an issue now
24-09-2020T18:22:26,AspiringNoodle,"If I start making Tom money, then maybe I'll consider a $500 laptop :snail:"
24-09-2020T18:22:53,Ordithus,don't need Tom money for that haha
24-09-2020T18:25:07,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-clovischuckle:*[I gots somes monies ta lends ya]
24-09-2020T18:25:14,CrRAR,:moneybag:
24-09-2020T18:25:30,AspiringNoodle,Money from the Prince of Greed?
24-09-2020T18:25:40,AspiringNoodle,I can't think of any downsides. Deal!
24-09-2020T18:28:59,AspiringNoodle,"Man, that bios update wasn't kidding"
24-09-2020T18:29:05,Ordithus,isn't your desktop super fancy?
24-09-2020T18:29:18,AspiringNoodle,Boot time went from 22 - 23 seconds to 16.7.  Kinda
24-09-2020T18:29:36,AspiringNoodle,"I basically have what Sage has, with a 1-step lower gpu iirc"
24-09-2020T18:29:54,AspiringNoodle,I also spent a bunch of extra money on higher performance parts (diminishing returns ftw)
24-09-2020T18:30:39,AspiringNoodle,I'll probably upgrade the GPU come the 40 series
24-09-2020T18:32:23,AspiringNoodle,"1440p is a tricky area for GPUs, lol"
24-09-2020T18:32:55,AspiringNoodle,Lots of titles you can get away with lower end GPUs and still hit 60+ fps.  Then some AAA titles you want to have something that's a few steps from the top at minimum if you want to crank the settings.
24-09-2020T18:33:14,Ordithus,granted it probably still looks amazing
24-09-2020T18:33:22,AspiringNoodle,"Oh yeah, no, this thing is peak :)"
24-09-2020T18:33:31,Ordithus,og skyrim is dated as heck now but I think it's still pretty
24-09-2020T18:34:16,AspiringNoodle,Control is the most recent game title I've gotten
24-09-2020T18:34:35,AspiringNoodle,Things aren't looking good for my setup.  But we'll see what I can do with the settings
24-09-2020T18:35:11,AspiringNoodle,The benchmarks people have done on Control @1440p with a 2070 super say I should expect an average FPS of ~52 - 53 with the settings cranked.
24-09-2020T18:35:48,Ordithus,so might have to make a tradeoff if you want buttery smooth
24-09-2020T18:35:51,AspiringNoodle,But I have a custom OC on my card.  And there's probably some stuff I can lower with 0 visual difference.
24-09-2020T18:36:23,AspiringNoodle,You know how much performance you leave on the table if you don't adjust the frequencies on your cards? xD
24-09-2020T18:36:34,Ordithus,no clue
24-09-2020T18:36:40,Ordithus,I don't mess with that
24-09-2020T18:36:52,AspiringNoodle,"I cranked the power limit on my card to 111%, didn't touch the voltage"
24-09-2020T18:37:15,AspiringNoodle,"Got an extra 90mhz on the core, and 800 on the memory.  That's on top of whatever the factory did over reference."
24-09-2020T18:41:48,AspiringNoodle,"So yeah, my control experience might be a *smidge* different"
24-09-2020T18:43:00,Ordithus,that game looks pretty awesome just from gameplay
24-09-2020T18:44:09,K3IDRAN,Gonna. Get Farcry 6 when it comes out
24-09-2020T18:44:21,K3IDRAN,Or jot i don't know yet
24-09-2020T18:48:04,AspiringNoodle,"When I built my pc, control was part of a promotion"
24-09-2020T18:48:30,AspiringNoodle,"So I got a 2070 super, Control, and Wolfenstein: Youngblood"
24-09-2020T18:48:49,AspiringNoodle,"Problem is, like I said, 2070 super might not be powerful enough to crank the settings on these games :ptv-laugh:"
24-09-2020T18:49:08,AspiringNoodle,"At least at 1440p.  I find it funny how everyone is obsessing over 4k, while glossing over 1440p."
24-09-2020T18:49:38,AspiringNoodle,"Seriously, 1440p should be the next logical step in terms of resolution scaling.  4k is stupidly demanding as far as games go."
24-09-2020T18:50:19,Ordithus,with 4k you could pretty well do without AA
24-09-2020T18:50:27,AspiringNoodle,"The only thing I'd change is getting a smaller 1440p panel.  27"" is pretty flippin' huge."
24-09-2020T18:50:37,AspiringNoodle,"Would've been better off with a 24"""
24-09-2020T18:51:21,AspiringNoodle,"That said, if I ever get into a situation where I can move further back from my monitor, 27"" is perfect."
24-09-2020T19:25:29,Rainelover,"Oh boy, I’m back, I’m 18, and I am ready for this stream!"
24-09-2020T19:25:51,CrRAR,"yeah the brightness alone above 24"" gets really noticable"

24-09-2020T19:53:39,CrRAR,maybe now she's the closer now?
