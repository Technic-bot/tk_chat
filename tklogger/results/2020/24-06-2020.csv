24-06-2020T05:21:06,TerraTheWizard,it's too dang waaaaarm
24-06-2020T05:51:34,AspiringNoodle,*sigh*
24-06-2020T05:51:43,AspiringNoodle,Not even the promise of a cute kitty skin in Fortnite could get me to stick around..
24-06-2020T05:52:12,AspiringNoodle,"If they ever reinvent the game to remove the building element, then maybe I'll give it another shot"
24-06-2020T08:51:28,Dadrobit,Cod Mobile I find is actually a pretty good Battle Royale.

24-06-2020T15:11:23,Twokinds,Patreon really frustrates me sometimes.
24-06-2020T15:11:45,Twokinds,They disabled the ability for non-patrons to leave comments. And there's no way for me to allow it.
24-06-2020T15:13:02,AspiringNoodle,"Well, there's a reason Patreon is *dying* xD"
24-06-2020T15:13:26,AspiringNoodle,I'm just happy your art hasn't been touched
24-06-2020T15:16:38,Twokinds,I don't understand why companies can't leave well enough alone.
24-06-2020T15:17:21,AspiringNoodle,"Uhhhhhh, if you lurk in the iffier parts of the web, the common concept is this"
24-06-2020T15:17:58,AspiringNoodle,"Colleges act like indoctrination centers.  They notoriously lean left, to the detriment of (R) / conservative professors"
24-06-2020T15:18:18,AspiringNoodle,So certain lines of political thinking get spread to the students more than others
24-06-2020T15:18:42,Dadrobit,"I understand why Patreon has made some of the changes they did with stopping the promotion of sexual content and the like. That's the work of the banks not wanting to be associated with what they might classify as something approaching ""prostitution""."
24-06-2020T15:18:53,Dadrobit,But stuff like limiting comments? I have no clue.
24-06-2020T15:19:09,AspiringNoodle,"Ah, thought he might be commenting on art changes"
24-06-2020T15:19:24,AspiringNoodle,I was worried Tom might get hit because of an art change a while back
24-06-2020T15:20:19,AspiringNoodle,"Also, Dadro, the ""promotion"" goes well beyond that"
24-06-2020T15:20:49,AspiringNoodle,"They outright forbid your works have certain kinds of content, doesn't matter if you promote that content or not"
24-06-2020T15:21:26,AspiringNoodle,"And even if it does have that content, but you don't promote it on Patreon, they've gotten into the habit of policing  people off platform"
24-06-2020T15:22:03,AspiringNoodle,It's honestly digusting how they've been treating the people who made the platform what it is
24-06-2020T15:22:37,Dadrobit,"That's the decision they have to make. If the banks say. ""No X, Y, or Z."" then X, Y, and Z is getting the axe. Catering to a particular section of their base to the detriment of being able to do business at all is not an option."
24-06-2020T15:23:04,AspiringNoodle,"Well, ironically, Patreon is killing themselves by catering to the banks, lol"
24-06-2020T15:23:31,Dadrobit,"If the banks pull their support, then the platform goes under completely screwing not only the folks you are riled up about, but also screwing literally everyone else as well."
24-06-2020T15:23:44,AspiringNoodle,"Here's my issue, why do the banks care?"
24-06-2020T15:23:51,Dadrobit,Because of public image
24-06-2020T15:24:02,AspiringNoodle,"Bah, public image is a bunch of BS"
24-06-2020T15:24:19,Dadrobit,That is objectively completely fucking false.
24-06-2020T15:24:19,AspiringNoodle,The same people who spout their holier than thou attitudes everywhere also tend to be the *kinkiest* people online...
24-06-2020T15:24:35,CrRAR,"Not when ‚ÄúBah, bah, bah, ow my fragile values!‚Äù"
24-06-2020T15:24:52,AspiringNoodle,"I love pr0nhub, they pull back the curtain"
24-06-2020T15:25:02,AspiringNoodle,The states that are the most religious / uptight?
24-06-2020T15:25:13,AspiringNoodle,"Some of their biggest users, and for a lot of *very* kinky content"
24-06-2020T15:25:43,AspiringNoodle,"So I make my point.  The banks should just shut up and finance stuff.  If it's not illegal, don't worry about it!"
24-06-2020T15:26:25,Dadrobit,"Problem is, banks are national/international. One set of laws in one place may very well differ from another where the bank still hold influence."
24-06-2020T15:27:04,AspiringNoodle,That starts going into the realm of countries coercing businesses outside their sphere of influence
24-06-2020T15:27:06,CrRAR,"True, I think they also wave the moral high ground flag to protect older business and stifle upstarts."
24-06-2020T15:27:14,AspiringNoodle,^
24-06-2020T15:27:55,AspiringNoodle,I'm making my hill to die on.  If an American bank (that's part of an international) does business with an American business person
24-06-2020T15:28:02,CrRAR,"Like a guy I know has been trying to start a hemp based building company, like insulation and stuff."
24-06-2020T15:28:14,Dadrobit,"Not even countries, hell, not even states. City to city laws can vary wildly and come in varying levels of crazy anti-progressiveness."
24-06-2020T15:28:25,CrRAR,And US Bank gave them a hard time becaus of their business
24-06-2020T15:28:37,AspiringNoodle,"And that person is doing something completely legal within America, there should *not* be pressured to cut ties because of legality outside of where business is being done"
24-06-2020T15:28:45,CrRAR,"They‚Äôre doing alright though, found other funding"
24-06-2020T15:29:07,AspiringNoodle,F morality police -_-
24-06-2020T15:29:39,Dadrobit,"Even as my state as a whole is slowly becoming more purple/progressive, I am reminded that the city just to the south of my own actively has a law forbidding anyone from wearing clothes that are not in alignment with their born sex."
24-06-2020T15:30:01,CrRAR,wow
24-06-2020T15:30:02,AspiringNoodle,"Wow, what year is this, the 1950's?"
24-06-2020T15:30:16,CrRAR,That sounds questionably unconstitutional
24-06-2020T15:30:38,AspiringNoodle,"Well, until a case gets elevated to the supreme court, it's staying.  That or the people say ""take that shiz down!"""
24-06-2020T15:31:11,Dadrobit,1950's? Please. There are half a dozen Confederate monuments throughout the state even though AZ wasn't even a part of the Civil War. We weren't even a state for another half century.
24-06-2020T15:31:25,Dadrobit,The folks here wanna go back waaay before the 1950's.
24-06-2020T15:31:38,AspiringNoodle,"Btw, I think I can sum up my position rather concisely"
24-06-2020T15:31:44,AspiringNoodle,And it's advice for businesses in general
24-06-2020T15:31:55,AspiringNoodle,STOP CATERING TO THE LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR
24-06-2020T15:32:39,CrRAR,That‚Äôs ‚Äúold money‚Äù for ya.
24-06-2020T15:32:39,Dadrobit,The .1% holds the overwhelming share of the economy. That's the lowest common denominator you're telling them to ignore.
24-06-2020T15:32:57,AspiringNoodle,"Not like that, I mean the friggin morality police"
24-06-2020T15:33:08,AspiringNoodle,"""But muh morality!"""
24-06-2020T15:33:44,AspiringNoodle,Can't wait for Cyberpunk
24-06-2020T15:33:51,AspiringNoodle,I'm definitely playing that one out of backlog order
24-06-2020T15:34:31,Dadrobit,"The ""Morality Police"" are a distraction my dude. While you're complaining about this, the folks with the money that actually make the rules are just gonna keep doing what they're doing."
24-06-2020T15:35:18,AspiringNoodle,"I haven't forgotten about them, but the MP definitely are a problem"
24-06-2020T15:35:24,AspiringNoodle,Them alongside cancel culture

24-06-2020T15:50:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I told her ok the fryers get shut down 6:30-7:00 so it‚Äôll have to be cooked before then (close to at that moment) & she said never mind
24-06-2020T15:52:59,SpazztasticKiwi,I felt sorta bad - that was her only option cause that‚Äôs when she was getting off work
24-06-2020T16:05:52,AspiringNoodle,"*snrrk*  Okay, kinda woke up today in a bad mood"
