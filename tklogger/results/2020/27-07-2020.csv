27-07-2020T00:01:18,SpazztasticKiwi,12 am
27-07-2020T00:01:48,CrRAR,whoop
27-07-2020T00:01:57,SpazztasticKiwi,kitty is 4
27-07-2020T00:02:31,SpazztasticKiwi,I took a picture of a flower today
27-07-2020T00:02:35,Dadrobit,It lead me down a fine road. My Neighbor Totoro was another that absolutely shaped my early years.
27-07-2020T00:02:50,Dadrobit,Happy birthday kitty!!!
27-07-2020T00:02:55,Dadrobit,Also Tom.
27-07-2020T00:03:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Toms birthday hit an hour ago
27-07-2020T00:03:19,CrRAR,"Yeah I feel like it’s really similar to Mononoke, but more literal"
27-07-2020T00:03:28,SpazztasticKiwi,it was 12 for him before kitty
27-07-2020T00:03:30,CrRAR,Yeah I still have to see Totoro
27-07-2020T00:03:47,Dadrobit,"Yeah, the pro environmentalism is strong."
27-07-2020T00:03:55,SpazztasticKiwi,totoro made me think I was on drugs at some points
27-07-2020T00:04:02,Dadrobit,"Well happy birthday again and still, Tom lol."
27-07-2020T00:04:06,CrRAR,Yeah balance with natural forces~
27-07-2020T00:04:20,CrRAR,I think that’s the Shinto influence
27-07-2020T00:06:25,SpazztasticKiwi,twas a bug of green with long antenna & anime long legs
27-07-2020T00:06:34,CrRAR,lol spazz
27-07-2020T00:06:41,Dadrobit,Could also be that Ghibli grew up right as mass globalization and industrialization was happening and he saw his homeland change so radically first hand.
27-07-2020T00:06:46,SpazztasticKiwi,my guess is a grasshopper cousin but idunno
27-07-2020T00:07:06,Dadrobit,But that's pure speculation on my part
27-07-2020T00:08:00,CrRAR,Yeah plus the history part too with Japan and WWII with nuclear fallout and whatnot
27-07-2020T00:08:03,Dadrobit,"Kind of how like Pokémon was created by a director who loved going out to collect bugs as a kid, but could no longer because everything was built over"
27-07-2020T00:08:46,SpazztasticKiwi,when you’re the youngest of a group and they start talking about pre-you
27-07-2020T00:08:58,CrRAR,"The “warrior” beast agains the Ohms shot two blasts, I was wondering if that was supposed to symbolize hiroshima, nagasaki"
27-07-2020T00:09:23,CrRAR,Like obs it was supposed to be a beast of war
27-07-2020T00:09:24,Dadrobit,Very very very most probably possible.
27-07-2020T00:09:42,Dadrobit,Lol spazz
27-07-2020T00:10:21,CrRAR,"But yeah spazz, I think spirited away has that trippy effect too"
27-07-2020T00:10:25,CrRAR,Haha
27-07-2020T00:11:09,AspiringNoodle,Studio Ghibli films are AMAZING
27-07-2020T00:11:11,Dadrobit,Spirited Away is the one that I somehow have always put off.
27-07-2020T00:11:17,AspiringNoodle,Thankfully the new studio is carrying on the tradition
27-07-2020T00:11:23,CrRAR,The furnace room poofs were my favorite part
27-07-2020T00:11:25,AspiringNoodle,"DUDE, DO IT, WATCH IT"
27-07-2020T00:11:33,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ll just watch - there’s chicken n fries to eat
27-07-2020T00:11:40,CrRAR,I think they’re in totoro too supposedly?
27-07-2020T00:12:14,CrRAR,"Yeah it is a weird concept, dad"
27-07-2020T00:12:18,CrRAR,That one
27-07-2020T00:12:48,CrRAR,Kind of more of a cautionary tale about the ugliness of the world
27-07-2020T00:13:05,CrRAR,Things aren’t allways what they seem etcec
27-07-2020T00:13:12,Dadrobit,"Like, I've heard amazing things, I've even had the chance to see it in theatres a few times. Just never made the trip."
27-07-2020T00:14:09,Dadrobit,Ughhhhhh... I miss going to the movies.... Now I made myself sad lol
27-07-2020T00:14:32,SpazztasticKiwi,...sadrobit
27-07-2020T00:15:03,Dadrobit,Very
27-07-2020T00:15:12,SpazztasticKiwi,I got dad jokes
27-07-2020T00:16:00,Dadrobit,Local chain called Harkins had some awesome events.
27-07-2020T00:16:16,Dadrobit,Can't wait for them to open back up.
27-07-2020T00:16:57,SpazztasticKiwi,what has 2 butts and kills people?
27-07-2020T00:17:21,SpazztasticKiwi,assassin
27-07-2020T00:17:38,Dadrobit,"Tuesday Night Classics was my absolute jam. Seeing movies like Alien, Aliens, 2001, Die Hard all properly in a movie theater is incredible."
27-07-2020T00:17:39,CrRAR,3 if he got a cigar
27-07-2020T00:17:53,CrRAR,Or cigarette
27-07-2020T00:18:09,CrRAR,"Butt of gun, cig butt, butt butt"
27-07-2020T00:18:11,SpazztasticKiwi,how dare you try to out dad me
27-07-2020T00:18:21,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
27-07-2020T00:18:25,SpazztasticKiwi,the jokes about the name tho
27-07-2020T00:18:37,SpazztasticKiwi,ass-ass-in
27-07-2020T00:18:40,Dadrobit,Allow me to butt in here just a moment...
27-07-2020T00:18:47,CrRAR,Ohhhhh
27-07-2020T00:18:51,CrRAR,lol
27-07-2020T00:18:56,SpazztasticKiwi,oh great I started a butt joke thread
27-07-2020T00:19:02,CrRAR,5 butts then
27-07-2020T00:19:05,SpazztasticKiwi,this stinks
27-07-2020T00:19:25,CrRAR,6 if a butt chin is involved
27-07-2020T00:19:36,SpazztasticKiwi,what did 50 do when it got hungry
27-07-2020T00:19:38,CrRAR,Any more?
27-07-2020T00:19:48,SpazztasticKiwi,58
27-07-2020T00:19:59,CrRAR,Harharhar
27-07-2020T00:20:04,Dadrobit,A butt load more tbh
27-07-2020T00:20:24,CrRAR,One thing that I noticed very similar between Nausicca & Mononoke was they both run around... A LOT.
27-07-2020T00:20:42,CrRAR,Like everything they did most of the time was running

27-07-2020T00:21:04,CrRAR,:ok_hand:
27-07-2020T00:21:11,AspiringNoodle,"Dadro, sorry for the late continuation, apex matched me super quick"
27-07-2020T00:21:26,CrRAR,Sometimes ir be like that
27-07-2020T00:21:29,CrRAR,It
27-07-2020T00:21:32,AspiringNoodle,Spirited Away has AMAZING world building
27-07-2020T00:21:47,AspiringNoodle,There is actually a 2-minute sequence where the protagonist retraces her steps
27-07-2020T00:21:58,AspiringNoodle,And it just shows such an astounding level of continuity
27-07-2020T00:22:03,CrRAR,"Yeah, very vivid and populated"
27-07-2020T00:22:57,AspiringNoodle,I've basically seen every single Studio Ghibli film at this point
27-07-2020T00:25:01,Dadrobit,"Hey, spazz, why did six hate seven?"
27-07-2020T00:25:24,Dadrobit,Because seven was a six-offender.
27-07-2020T00:27:17,Dadrobit,You know what kills me the most about it? I think I actually own Spirited Away.
27-07-2020T00:28:07,AspiringNoodle,"Um, I think several artists we know have an angry emote that I wish I had access to"
27-07-2020T00:28:08,Dadrobit,I bought a shitload of Ghibli films on Blu Ray from a local Best Buy that was going out of business.
27-07-2020T00:28:25,AspiringNoodle,"So instead, I'll do this"
27-07-2020T00:28:35,AspiringNoodle,FFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU- :fireworks:
27-07-2020T00:28:45,CrRAR,"Yeah I want to say that was one of the first I watched, it was an interesting entry point tbh xD"
27-07-2020T00:29:37,Dadrobit,"Yup, just checked an old photo I took of my haul lol"

27-07-2020T00:29:47,CrRAR,nice
27-07-2020T00:29:52,Dadrobit,"There, never watched it."
27-07-2020T00:30:32,CrRAR,"haha, I’ve seen wolf children"
27-07-2020T00:30:44,Dadrobit,"Watched Wolf Children, personally didn't like it."
27-07-2020T00:30:56,CrRAR,"It’s a simpler story than I was expecting, yeah"
27-07-2020T00:31:10,Dadrobit,And the animation is honestly kinda jank
27-07-2020T00:31:21,Dadrobit,Lots of reused animation as well.
27-07-2020T00:31:31,CrRAR,"Yeah, not super memorable"
27-07-2020T00:32:28,CrRAR,Like real world problem with fantasy plastered on top
27-07-2020T00:32:56,Dadrobit,Yes!
27-07-2020T00:33:26,Dadrobit,"It felt disjointed, too many things at once."
27-07-2020T00:33:37,CrRAR,eyup
27-07-2020T00:34:46,SpazztasticKiwi,did you know all the people living in my town aren’t allowed to be buried at the cemetery
27-07-2020T00:34:54,SpazztasticKiwi,because they’re still alive
27-07-2020T00:35:25,CrRAR,Sounds like a good rule
27-07-2020T00:35:39,SpazztasticKiwi,why do chicken coops have 2 doors
27-07-2020T00:35:56,SpazztasticKiwi,because if they had 4 they’d be  chicken sedans
27-07-2020T00:36:14,CrRAR,:ccrrar-chickcr:

27-07-2020T00:36:49,SpazztasticKiwi,the third ducks
27-07-2020T00:37:11,CrRAR,lol
27-07-2020T00:37:27,SpazztasticKiwi,how do you make holy water
27-07-2020T00:37:31,CrRAR,Well usually a chiken door and a service door or something
27-07-2020T00:37:34,SpazztasticKiwi,boil the hell out of it
27-07-2020T00:37:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"similarly, how do you make someone holy"
27-07-2020T00:37:52,SpazztasticKiwi,beat the hell out of em
27-07-2020T00:38:17,Dadrobit,I just have a human door and the chickens lay in an area that has a roof open like a good so you can take the eggs from the top.
27-07-2020T00:38:31,CrRAR,Ah
27-07-2020T00:38:38,Dadrobit,Like a hood*
27-07-2020T00:38:57,SpazztasticKiwi,ok good I was trying to recombobulate that
27-07-2020T00:39:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I had a dream I was a muffler last night
27-07-2020T00:39:23,SpazztasticKiwi,woke up exhausted
27-07-2020T00:39:32,CrRAR,That’s... special
27-07-2020T00:40:10,SpazztasticKiwi,5/4 people are bad with fractions
27-07-2020T00:40:24,Dadrobit,"I drove a rental the other day for 20 miles with the emergency brake on. I dunno if that says more about me, or the EMERGENCY brake?"
27-07-2020T00:40:43,SpazztasticKiwi,what will happen when fedex & ups merge
27-07-2020T00:40:50,SpazztasticKiwi,they’ll become fed-up
27-07-2020T00:40:54,Dadrobit,"It's less an emergency brake, and more a ""make the car smell funny"" lever."
27-07-2020T00:41:05,Dadrobit,-Mitch Hedberg
27-07-2020T00:41:19,CrRAR,Yeah the cables or the brakes will burn out
27-07-2020T00:41:59,CrRAR,"I think moreso the cables get messed up, because it screws uo the tension"
27-07-2020T00:42:08,CrRAR,up
27-07-2020T00:42:36,SpazztasticKiwi,the worst one I came across is a dad telling his son he was adopted so the son shoots back “well then you’re a virgin” but
27-07-2020T00:43:03,SpazztasticKiwi,not quite how that works
27-07-2020T00:43:07,CrRAR,“allegedly”

27-07-2020T00:57:41,AspiringNoodle,"Nope, I probably won't be buying playstation games until the PS5"
27-07-2020T00:57:50,AspiringNoodle,"No point in buying a PS4 Pro at this point, lol"
27-07-2020T00:58:04,AspiringNoodle,I'm looking forward to tracking down some PS3 goodies :D
27-07-2020T00:58:45,Dadrobit,Hopefully it's PS5 compatible. GoT is an easy GOTY unless CP2077 knocks it way the hell out of the park.
27-07-2020T00:59:38,Dadrobit,"No joke, some of the absolute best story and acting I've seen in a game."
27-07-2020T00:59:59,AspiringNoodle,Should be compatible
27-07-2020T01:00:08,AspiringNoodle,PS5 is gonna be backwards compatible up to PS3
27-07-2020T01:03:09,Dadrobit,"I have not heard of any official announcement of backwards compatibility outside of ""we've tested the top 100 best sellers of PS4 and so far they all work""."
27-07-2020T01:03:20,Dadrobit,Nothing on PS3 sfaia
27-07-2020T01:11:00,TorqueEmUp,Sony I can almost guarantee won't have any kind of PS3 backwards compatibility.
27-07-2020T01:12:02,SpazztasticKiwi,🦉
27-07-2020T01:13:24,TorqueEmUp,Microsoft is only doing it for the Xbox because they have been working to climb back up the hill they fell off back in 2013.
27-07-2020T01:14:57,Dadrobit,"Yeah, the PS3 architecture that the games ran off of are so far removed from the modern system that there's almost no chance there's 100% compatibility."
27-07-2020T01:15:48,TorqueEmUp,I mean Series X won't even have full backwards compatibility with anything further back than Xbox One.
27-07-2020T01:15:51,Dadrobit,Only real hope is that they keep working on getting more of them working with emulators on PSN
27-07-2020T01:16:38,TorqueEmUp,"Playstation Now really isn't Emulators, they are basically server mounted boards with PS3 hardware."
27-07-2020T01:16:49,Dadrobit,PlayStation Network
27-07-2020T01:17:26,Dadrobit,There are a couple PS3 he's on there.
27-07-2020T01:17:31,Dadrobit,Games*
27-07-2020T01:18:06,Dadrobit,"I'm like, 98% certain."
27-07-2020T01:18:56,Dadrobit,Though I know they're missing a ton.
27-07-2020T01:19:08,TorqueEmUp,"Any examples, I haven't heard of such a thing. Most PS3 games re-released on PS4 basically were just the PC version reworked to run on the PS4."
27-07-2020T01:20:30,TorqueEmUp,I know there is some PS2 ports that you can get on PS4.
27-07-2020T01:20:40,TorqueEmUp,Like Destroy All Humans
27-07-2020T01:23:13,TorqueEmUp,"I don't know if those are emulated, or stripped back and reworked to run on x86"
27-07-2020T01:23:39,TorqueEmUp,But I do know they had no trophy support for any of these PS2 games.
27-07-2020T01:23:43,TorqueEmUp,on PS4
27-07-2020T01:26:00,Dadrobit,"Yeah, looking into it now, it seems everything must have just been the re-ported PC versions."
27-07-2020T01:26:53,Dadrobit,PS3 was too different for its own good.
27-07-2020T01:27:00,TorqueEmUp,"Yeah, any Ps3 games you want to play on PS4 has to be on PSNow."
27-07-2020T01:27:22,TorqueEmUp,Which runs the game at a server farm housing basically PS3 hardware in servers.
27-07-2020T01:27:36,Dadrobit,"Some fabulous games took advantage of it, but alas."
27-07-2020T01:28:28,TorqueEmUp,"And I haven't heard much of a peep about PSNow in years now, makes me think Sony might pull the plug on it."
27-07-2020T01:28:52,Dadrobit,"My PS3 HDD just recently gave up the ghost, so I need to get a new SSD for it at some point."
27-07-2020T01:30:00,TorqueEmUp,I decided to torture myself and play through and Platinum Fallout 3 GOTY Edition.
27-07-2020T01:30:05,TorqueEmUp,a few months ago
27-07-2020T01:30:23,TorqueEmUp,"Because I felt like playing it again, but already 100%'d once on 360, and once on PC."
27-07-2020T01:31:47,SpazztasticKiwi,nite Tom
27-07-2020T01:31:57,TorqueEmUp,Game runs likes garbage on PS3 because straight port of from the 360 with no Cell Processor optimization.
27-07-2020T01:32:26,TorqueEmUp,Happy Birthday Tom!
27-07-2020T01:32:51,Dadrobit,The PS Now July update added Street Fighter V and Watchdogs 2 as well as a few smaller games.
27-07-2020T01:33:32,Dadrobit,"Don't have it myself, but they're constantly advertising it to me lol."
27-07-2020T01:33:58,TorqueEmUp,"Ahh, I jump around a lot between platforms."
27-07-2020T01:34:20,Dadrobit,I wonder if it just feels like they haven't openly advertised it because all the big press releases like E3 where they'd normally talk it up got cancelled?
27-07-2020T01:34:31,Dadrobit,Is because*
27-07-2020T01:34:37,TorqueEmUp,"Before Fallout 3 playthrough, last thing I played on a Playstation platform was Death Stranding and I platinum'd that."
27-07-2020T01:34:56,Dadrobit,Mmmm still need to do that myself
27-07-2020T01:35:12,TorqueEmUp,I still need to play Uncharted Lost Legacy
27-07-2020T01:35:24,Dadrobit,I stick to PC and PS. Everything on XBox is available on PC anyways lol
27-07-2020T01:35:44,TorqueEmUp,Yeah I get you there. But even Sony is slowly starting to slide that way too.
27-07-2020T01:36:24,Dadrobit,Uncharted is a series I've missed out on somehow. I own all the games free anyways through PSN giveaways lol. Just never got around to them.
27-07-2020T01:38:34,Dadrobit,"Yeah, Cyberpunk is gonna be my first game I'm conciously buying on PC instead of PS4. Maybe if the PS5 was already out I'd get it there."
27-07-2020T01:38:41,TorqueEmUp,"Yeah, I played through them on PS3, then bought the Collection on PS4, then played through them again. Could only Platinum the first one, because 2 and 3 on PS3 had Multiplayer trophies. =/"
27-07-2020T01:38:57,Dadrobit,"Ehhh, hate those for the most part"
27-07-2020T01:39:41,Dadrobit,Elder Scrolls Online has the worst one. Gold trophy requires you to be the number 1 pvp player for the week and be crowned king.
27-07-2020T01:39:55,Dadrobit,Fu-huuuuck that noise
27-07-2020T01:40:00,TorqueEmUp,I still can't justify spending $60 on a digital license for a game.
27-07-2020T01:40:18,TorqueEmUp,"That's my biggest problem with PC gaming, I just like having the discs."
27-07-2020T01:41:15,Dadrobit,I miss the old PC disc boxes.
27-07-2020T01:41:21,TorqueEmUp,"This ""you don't own the game"" BS is for the birds."
27-07-2020T01:41:48,Dadrobit,The BattleChests for the Diablo and StarCraft games were fucking amazing.
27-07-2020T01:42:12,TorqueEmUp,"Case and point, the only way to play GTA IV in all it's originality is to buy the 360 or PS3 version, and play it offline."
27-07-2020T01:42:14,Dadrobit,Still have those player guides on my shelves
27-07-2020T01:42:33,TorqueEmUp,Because they patched out music they no longer have the music for.
27-07-2020T01:42:41,TorqueEmUp,like license for*
27-07-2020T01:42:44,TorqueEmUp,gah
27-07-2020T01:42:47,TorqueEmUp,I can't type
27-07-2020T01:43:04,Dadrobit,RIP to all the server based games out there like MAG and Dust 514 as well.
27-07-2020T01:43:15,TorqueEmUp,"They no longer have the license for that music, and since they are still selling the game, they have to patch out the music."
27-07-2020T01:43:58,TorqueEmUp,Even for the 360 and PS3
27-07-2020T01:44:49,AspiringNoodle,"Honestly, I wish PC came with a nice little console-esque case"
27-07-2020T01:44:51,Dadrobit,"Man, I wonder how they even wrote that contract?"
27-07-2020T01:45:09,AspiringNoodle,But they usually use clunky af boxes
27-07-2020T01:45:14,Dadrobit,"Like, I know EXACTLY how that contract was written, but still..."
27-07-2020T01:45:17,AspiringNoodle,And then the CD's are in little paper sleeves...
27-07-2020T01:45:54,TorqueEmUp,"I dunno, but all games are subject to it. Makes you wonder why movies are allowed to keep being sold with licensed music, but games have to have the music removed or stop being sold all together when the license expires."
27-07-2020T01:46:52,TorqueEmUp,"If you buy Vice City on any modern platform, it's not going to have all of the 80s hits that were in the game when it launched on PS2."
27-07-2020T01:46:59,AspiringNoodle,"Honestly, they just need to write it in the contract"
27-07-2020T01:47:06,Dadrobit,Cost cutting. They saved money by making the license limited instead of perpetual.
27-07-2020T01:47:12,AspiringNoodle,"""What we put in the game, STAYS in the game"""
27-07-2020T01:47:29,Dadrobit,That costs money noodle
27-07-2020T01:47:43,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-natsducky:
27-07-2020T01:48:42,AspiringNoodle,"GTA V broke a billion dollars, lol"
27-07-2020T01:48:50,AspiringNoodle,I think they can afford the licenses going forward
27-07-2020T01:48:54,Dadrobit,They bought a bunch of licensed music and it was just gonna cost a boatload of money either way.
27-07-2020T01:49:02,Dadrobit,"Well sure, going forward."
27-07-2020T01:49:17,TorqueEmUp,I remember there being a Vice City Soundtrack sold at Toys R Us back in the day.
27-07-2020T01:49:22,AspiringNoodle,"But honestly, they should do *something* about it"
27-07-2020T01:49:34,AspiringNoodle,Because it's stupid that the games lack music after a certain point
27-07-2020T01:50:31,Dadrobit,Why should they? GTA IV sales aren't even a drop in the bucket. Spending money on getting perpetual licenses would be a huge waste of capital for them.
27-07-2020T01:51:13,TorqueEmUp,"Indeed, I remember GTA IV when that came out was the costliest game ever to produce up until that point in time."
27-07-2020T01:51:25,Dadrobit,"Especially since the record companies now KNOW for a fact how much they could fleece them for, they sure as shit aren't gonna get a good deal."
27-07-2020T01:51:50,TorqueEmUp,Don't get me started on Record Companies. :P
27-07-2020T01:52:23,TorqueEmUp,They are the reason you can't play more than a couple second of music in a video without it getting copyright striked.
27-07-2020T01:52:25,Dadrobit,"I took a year in copyright law and music business, I know lol."
27-07-2020T01:52:29,TorqueEmUp,on youtube I mean
27-07-2020T01:52:56,Dadrobit,"Alas, such is their right."
27-07-2020T01:54:17,TorqueEmUp,Being their right doesn't make it any less dumb.
27-07-2020T01:54:26,TorqueEmUp,:p
27-07-2020T01:54:34,Dadrobit,shrugs
27-07-2020T01:54:47,Dadrobit,"Shit sucks, but it is what it is for now."
27-07-2020T01:55:40,Dadrobit,Doesn't help that everyone and their kitchen sink thinks they're a lawyer and have the right to use copyrights of others all Willy Billy.
27-07-2020T01:55:50,Dadrobit,Willy Nilly
27-07-2020T01:57:39,TorqueEmUp,Indeed
27-07-2020T02:01:42,TorqueEmUp,"Nothing like firing up a music app, and finding songs in your playlists have been removed because licenses through that service expired."
27-07-2020T02:02:40,Dadrobit,Audio Blocks was/is like that. It's a minefield.
27-07-2020T02:03:02,TorqueEmUp,"I don't really buy music, but when I do I always get a CD and make my own digital backups."
27-07-2020T02:03:28,TorqueEmUp,but I don't listen to a whole lot of music in the first place.
27-07-2020T02:03:49,Dadrobit,"Working as a voice actor, I'm often requested to put in the backing tracks myself. It's not fun trying to find music to put in that won't have their license revoked in X years."
27-07-2020T02:04:22,Dadrobit,Or trying to find public domain music that isn't beaten to death.
27-07-2020T02:04:41,TorqueEmUp,"Yeah, that sounds like a huge pain."
27-07-2020T02:04:43,TerraTheWizard,"oh right, today's tuesday"
27-07-2020T02:04:56,TerraTheWizard,happy birthday @Twokinds :ctwokinds-nibsbdaydance:
27-07-2020T02:05:38,Dadrobit,\o/
27-07-2020T02:06:05,TorqueEmUp,Oh I see a new Beastars chapter has been posted. (Though I am a couple days late to realizing it)
27-07-2020T02:06:57,Dadrobit,"Beast stars started out really really strong, but I'm not a huge fan of the direction it's taken."
27-07-2020T02:07:39,Dadrobit,Right around where Melon came in I think.
27-07-2020T02:08:07,Dadrobit,Too much power creep I think.
27-07-2020T02:08:25,Dadrobit,Still gonna read it tho
27-07-2020T02:09:33,SpazztasticKiwi,🛌
27-07-2020T02:09:50,Dadrobit,Night Spazz
27-07-2020T02:13:32,TorqueEmUp,Yeah I do agree it kinda took a bit of a dive once Melon came in the picture.
27-07-2020T02:15:10,TorqueEmUp,Can't really say anymore without giving spoilers.
27-07-2020T02:16:52,TorqueEmUp,Sometimes I just want to beat Legosi over the head sometimes.
27-07-2020T02:17:28,TorqueEmUp,Sometimes sometimes. Ughh
27-07-2020T02:17:35,Dadrobit,Just now realizing I have a good 4 or 5 chapters to catch up on.
27-07-2020T02:24:07,AspiringNoodle,Sorry for dropping off the face of the conversation xD
27-07-2020T02:24:19,AspiringNoodle,"Reached Plat IV in Apex Legends, and grouped with some entertaining guys"
27-07-2020T02:24:52,AspiringNoodle,"Earlier when I said Rockstar should do something, it could be as little as adding royalty free music into the games"
27-07-2020T02:25:28,AspiringNoodle,"heck, they could make that DLC so it's not a complete write off"
27-07-2020T02:33:19,Dadrobit,Aaaaand I'm caught up with the manga.
27-07-2020T02:33:33,TorqueEmUp,nice
27-07-2020T02:34:57,Dadrobit,"Noodle, it's not like they removed ALL the music. Just some. Half of it the Russian stuff."
27-07-2020T02:35:11,Dadrobit,And they even compensated by adding new music in.
27-07-2020T02:36:34,AspiringNoodle,Oh sweet :D
27-07-2020T02:36:48,AspiringNoodle,"It sounded like most of the music got removed, lol"
27-07-2020T02:37:04,AspiringNoodle,I shouldn't have doubted Rockstar
27-07-2020T02:39:04,Dadrobit,"Speaking of driving to a great soundtrack, man I can't wait for Gran Turismo on PS5."
27-07-2020T02:39:34,Dadrobit,"Sport was okay, but it was a bit too free with giving out crazy fast cars"
27-07-2020T02:40:11,Dadrobit,No sense of progression when you finish 10 races and have like 4 supercars as prizes right off the bat.
27-07-2020T02:43:36,Dadrobit,The online community of racers is pretty great though. Almost everyone is incredibly polite on the track. Next to zero griefing.
27-07-2020T03:38:07,AspiringNoodle,Night everyone~
27-07-2020T03:38:39,AspiringNoodle,"Don't know why, but basically doing nothing these past 2 days has me energized to get back to improving myself xD"
