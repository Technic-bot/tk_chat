03-07-2020T00:05:24,Dadrobit,"Oh, Sage, I watched A Whisker Away"
03-07-2020T00:05:31,Ordithus,aight
03-07-2020T00:05:33,Dadrobit,"Oh, see ya in a bit"
03-07-2020T00:13:21,SageSaga,back - food should be done in about 5 minutes
03-07-2020T00:13:54,Werewing,I am in a great mood.
03-07-2020T00:14:07,SageSaga,good
03-07-2020T00:14:08,Dadrobit,Good to hear!
03-07-2020T00:14:09,Ordithus,wb
03-07-2020T00:14:28,Dadrobit,"Wb, Sage"
03-07-2020T00:14:41,Werewing,I was just thinking of the Dragonriders of Pern. Just remembering the (unintended) twist makes me happy.
03-07-2020T00:15:46,Dadrobit,"Never got around to reading it, but I recall it had pretty solid praise."
03-07-2020T00:16:58,AspiringNoodle,"Ugh, I must have really slept wrong"
03-07-2020T00:17:04,AspiringNoodle,My right shoulder's been bothering me all day...
03-07-2020T00:17:13,Werewing,"It is better if you start around the same time Masterharper Robinton comes into the picture; Read until the big series twist, then go back to the chronological first book forward."
03-07-2020T00:22:11,Dadrobit,"Ohhhhh, Anne McCaffrey!"
03-07-2020T00:22:25,Dadrobit,How did I skip this?
03-07-2020T00:24:03,SageSaga,food got
03-07-2020T00:24:08,Werewing,I don't know? Maybe Sage and Ron hynotised you with cat boobs?
03-07-2020T00:24:22,Werewing,"Hello, gotter of food."
03-07-2020T00:24:28,Ordithus,\o/ fooood
03-07-2020T00:24:40,Dadrobit,"Hmmm, as much as I loved a lot of work, I know she gets into the uncomfortably weird kinda like Heinlein especially when it comes to romance. Where do the dragonriders land?"
03-07-2020T00:25:03,Werewing,There only two sort of awkward romances I recall in the series:
03-07-2020T00:25:43,SageSaga,i just cant believe that book was all about people having orgies with dragons
03-07-2020T00:26:00,Werewing,"One very slightly off lesbian romance, which felt a bit stunted since I don't think she wanted to write a sex scene. And the one where one of the Dragonriders is watched through the whole event by his gelding dragon."
03-07-2020T00:26:29,Werewing,"Yes, and there's that, but it was a well written parallel orgies."
03-07-2020T00:26:39,Dadrobit,Like in the latter parts of the Talents series where the protagonist ends up with a little girl who is the daughter of his lifelong friend.
03-07-2020T00:27:09,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-keithdotdotdot: the heck did I just read
03-07-2020T00:27:14,Werewing,"I don't recall any of that happening, though I recall one of Robinton's pupils gets infatuated with him when he is older, he never goes through with it, though."
03-07-2020T00:27:17,SageSaga,was there really dragon human orgies? because ive never read it-
03-07-2020T00:27:45,Dadrobit,"Something about mid twentieth century fantasy/science fiction authors, Ord."
03-07-2020T00:27:49,Werewing,"Sort of, they don't have sex with the dragons, they just have sex at the same time. and there's a mind-meld thing."
03-07-2020T00:28:16,Dadrobit,"Mmmm, she was fond of mind mingling romances."
03-07-2020T00:28:27,Werewing,"If you like Sage's stuff, I bet you'd like the Dragonriders series."
03-07-2020T00:28:36,Werewing,I guess it was her kink.
03-07-2020T00:28:45,Dadrobit,.... I may or may not have read anything from Sage....
03-07-2020T00:29:12,SageSaga,<_<
03-07-2020T00:29:25,Werewing,"If you Isekai, you'll like Dragonriders of Pern."
03-07-2020T00:29:32,Dadrobit,>.>
03-07-2020T00:29:44,SageSaga,:csagesaga-nynastare:
03-07-2020T00:29:49,Werewing,"Dang it, I just spoiled that, didn't I."
03-07-2020T00:29:51,Dadrobit,:ptv-dealwithit:
03-07-2020T00:29:58,Dadrobit,Kinda
03-07-2020T00:30:00,Dadrobit,Lol
03-07-2020T00:30:02,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nighty night y'all
03-07-2020T00:30:09,Ordithus,night Marv
03-07-2020T00:30:17,SageSaga,night marv!
03-07-2020T00:30:20,Dadrobit,"Good night, Marv! Happy 4th!"
03-07-2020T00:31:00,Werewing,I just love that series to bits.
03-07-2020T00:31:30,SpazztasticKiwi,what deep fried disaster is going on
03-07-2020T00:31:40,Dadrobit,100% realizing who the author is I guarantee I'm gonna get into it now.
03-07-2020T00:31:53,Werewing,"I don't know, but that Callum face is emoji-worthy."
03-07-2020T00:32:01,Werewing,"Who is, Dad?"
03-07-2020T00:32:08,Werewing,Dadrobit*
03-07-2020T00:32:12,Dadrobit,Anne McCaffrey
03-07-2020T00:32:26,Dadrobit,Childhood author for me
03-07-2020T00:32:50,Werewing,"Do it, my heart is pounding just thinking of the idea of spreading the Dragonlady's word."
03-07-2020T00:32:52,SpazztasticKiwi,what I just read didn’t sound very childhoody
03-07-2020T00:33:21,Werewing,There's no directly relayed sex scenes. Just the written equivalent of fade-to-black.
03-07-2020T00:33:58,SageSaga,Fade To Black is classic sex scene
03-07-2020T00:34:00,Werewing,And the odd moment of clothed intimacy and pre-/post- cloitus.
03-07-2020T00:34:02,Dadrobit,"Yeah, there was never much beyond ""Then they did the deed and it was awesome""."
03-07-2020T00:34:26,Ordithus,such :ctwokinds-MikeLewd: writing
03-07-2020T00:34:39,Werewing,"Yeah, the gelding watching his rider do it is the kinkiest it ever got, and it wasn't much."
03-07-2020T00:34:55,SpazztasticKiwi,it all sounds like something that would make dr Phil & Maury quit and start drinking
03-07-2020T00:35:09,Dadrobit,"Problem is fantasy authors sometimes get a bit freaky when it comes to ""if there's grass on the field then play ball,"" Spazz."
03-07-2020T00:36:22,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m more than aware how bad writing can get
03-07-2020T00:36:43,aeoronwah,Oh good to see you're still streaming Sage
03-07-2020T00:36:44,Dadrobit,"""sure she's 14 and I'm 50, but we had 'a meeting of the minds' so it's all Gucci."""
03-07-2020T00:36:53,SpazztasticKiwi,now that
03-07-2020T00:36:54,SpazztasticKiwi,no
03-07-2020T00:37:11,SageSaga,no politics plz
03-07-2020T00:37:27,aeoronwah,"I'm gonna go get some booze, be back in like 20 minutes"
03-07-2020T00:37:33,Dadrobit,o/
03-07-2020T00:38:18,SageSaga,aww- no one fell for my joke trap
03-07-2020T00:38:35,Dadrobit,"Lol, not trying to get political, that's just legit how the Talents series ends."
03-07-2020T00:39:16,Ordithus,too sleepy to fall into traps
03-07-2020T00:39:22,SageSaga,was expecting yall to say you werent talking about politics and i was gonna say - oh when you said 15 year old and 50 year old i thought you were talking about Trump
03-07-2020T00:39:34,SageSaga,14*
03-07-2020T00:39:57,Dadrobit,16 year old me was somewhat scarred by that book evidently.
03-07-2020T00:40:07,Dadrobit,"Also, lol, Sage."
03-07-2020T00:40:09,SpazztasticKiwi,is it bad that I had another politician in mind with that jab?
03-07-2020T00:40:21,SageSaga,depends on who it was-
03-07-2020T00:40:26,Dadrobit,Epstein?
03-07-2020T00:40:32,SpazztasticKiwi,warm but no
03-07-2020T00:40:40,SpazztasticKiwi,or maybe he wasn’t a politician
03-07-2020T00:40:43,Dadrobit,Pretty sure he's room temperature now
03-07-2020T00:40:52,Ordithus,wow
03-07-2020T00:41:04,SpazztasticKiwi,was weinstein a politician
03-07-2020T00:41:15,SageSaga,no
03-07-2020T00:41:29,SpazztasticKiwi,for some reason he seems like one
03-07-2020T00:41:42,Dadrobit,"Nah, he was just reeeeaaaal close to a bunch of em."
03-07-2020T00:41:56,SpazztasticKiwi,that’s why I was thinking he was
03-07-2020T00:43:21,SageSaga,there was more to my joke too
03-07-2020T00:43:31,Dadrobit,Layers of jokes
03-07-2020T00:43:41,Ordithus,ogre joke
03-07-2020T00:43:42,SageSaga,if yall said Melania wasnt 14 when trump was 50 i was gonna say- no - but his daughter was
03-07-2020T00:43:43,Werewing,Weinstein was a movie manager thing.
03-07-2020T00:43:59,Werewing,Doesn't he have 2 daughters?
03-07-2020T00:44:04,Werewing,"Trump, I mean."
03-07-2020T00:44:08,SpazztasticKiwi,he did admit to having a crush on his daughter did he not
03-07-2020T00:44:09,SageSaga,no one remembers his other daughter
03-07-2020T00:44:18,SpazztasticKiwi,“if she wasn’t my daughter I’d date her”
03-07-2020T00:44:32,Ordithus,:ptv-grossedout:
03-07-2020T00:44:50,SageSaga,i believe he said he probably would be dating her- not just that he would- that he already would have engaged her-
03-07-2020T00:44:55,SageSaga,its a little more gross that way
03-07-2020T00:45:15,ZRO4825,"Was gonna say, the way Spazz said it, I don't understand that being gross. But with the way Sage put it, yeah, that's disgusting."
03-07-2020T00:45:51,Werewing,And there was also the insistent and excited tone he had when he said it.
03-07-2020T00:46:08,SpazztasticKiwi,it was along the lines that he thought she was pretty enough to date but he couldn’t because she was his daughter
03-07-2020T00:46:19,Werewing,"Like, if you quoted him, I would say put an ! at the end of the sentence."
03-07-2020T00:47:05,SageSaga,its creepy regardless
03-07-2020T00:47:08,Dadrobit,"Throw in how he admitted he and and Epstein shared the same interests in ""young"" girls and you got yourself a pretty full picture of the situation."
03-07-2020T00:47:36,SpazztasticKiwi,& his wife is what years younger too
03-07-2020T00:48:30,SageSaga,24
03-07-2020T00:49:10,Werewing,It gets worse when you think about the actions he has done against children in general. Mistreating Children's Hospitals' charities and child seperation. It is so predatory. And he seemed to enjoy talking about them.
03-07-2020T00:49:13,SpazztasticKiwi,i am their age gap
03-07-2020T00:49:17,SpazztasticKiwi,how many red flags do you need
03-07-2020T00:49:17,Dadrobit,Fully admits she's in it for the money.
03-07-2020T00:50:25,Dadrobit,Jokes on her. The estranged niece is probably gonna have more real money in the bank after her tell all book finally gets out of the legal hell Trump is forcing it through.
03-07-2020T00:50:27,Werewing,I wonder if she frequently wonders how much money there will be after he dies.
03-07-2020T00:50:59,SageSaga,doesnt matter- the book she writes will sell plenty
03-07-2020T00:51:43,Dadrobit,"Are you talking about Melainia, or the niece spazz?"
03-07-2020T00:51:45,Werewing,"After all these more interesting books, though? What about their near-nonexistent sex life would interest people?"
03-07-2020T00:51:49,Dadrobit,Sage*
03-07-2020T00:52:25,Werewing,"His niece has covered his personal life, and there's like a dozen professional associate biographies."
03-07-2020T00:52:44,SageSaga,She has a unique perspective only she can tell
03-07-2020T00:53:11,SageSaga,"just by being ""First Lady"" she can sell a ton from a tell all book even if it says nothing really new"
03-07-2020T00:53:14,Dadrobit,From her knees? Pretty sure the daughter has the same perspective.
03-07-2020T00:53:17,Werewing,I can't imagine anything meaningful being conveyed by Melania.
03-07-2020T00:53:32,SageSaga,she wouldnt write it of course
03-07-2020T00:53:51,SageSaga,she'd have a ghost writer do it- just like Art of the Deal- the book trump never wrote but wrote
03-07-2020T00:54:12,SpazztasticKiwi,I can imagine them being smart
03-07-2020T00:54:24,SpazztasticKiwi,not useful or meaningful writing
03-07-2020T00:54:42,SpazztasticKiwi,but smart people in their own ways maybe
03-07-2020T00:55:02,Werewing,I suppose she could write something flattering for the Trump supporters to replace their BIbles with.
03-07-2020T00:55:12,SpazztasticKiwi,unless they’re too far under mr president
03-07-2020T00:55:19,SpazztasticKiwi,‘s foot
03-07-2020T00:55:50,SageSaga,she can pander to whoever she wants- the book will sell regardless
03-07-2020T00:57:35,Dadrobit,"Yep, far right groups make a habit of buying out books upon release to inflate sales and force it to be a ""NYT best seller"". Then they donate them to libraries and second hand stores so they can write it off on their taxes."
03-07-2020T00:57:50,SageSaga,she just needs 2 stories- and she can lie and probably get away with it
03-07-2020T00:58:16,SageSaga,1 to tell to sell the book - and 1 extra in the book for people to talk about
03-07-2020T00:58:52,Calista,owo is that catgirl bouncing on a balloon in the gif? x3
03-07-2020T00:59:00,AspiringNoodle,I believe so
03-07-2020T00:59:05,SageSaga,nope
03-07-2020T00:59:20,AspiringNoodle,Yoga ball?
03-07-2020T00:59:25,SageSaga,correct
03-07-2020T00:59:25,Werewing,Is she bouncing on a bigger catgirl?
03-07-2020T00:59:28,AspiringNoodle,:D
03-07-2020T00:59:44,Werewing,"Darn, I was hoping for something more significantly diffrent."
03-07-2020T00:59:50,Ordithus,:csagesaga-bounce: bounce bounce
03-07-2020T01:05:20,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m convinced bouncing round things could hypnotize better than a stopwatch
03-07-2020T01:05:44,Dadrobit,I guarantee you that is true
03-07-2020T01:06:10,Dadrobit,Boobs have stopped far more men in their tacks than stopwatches ever have or could.
03-07-2020T01:07:01,Werewing,"Alas, the dirth of female stage magicians has limited that."
03-07-2020T01:08:34,AspiringNoodle,*Earth is invaded by aliens*
03-07-2020T01:08:39,Dadrobit,"You mean dearth? In which case perhaps you never noticed the ""stunning assistants"" the magician always has?"
03-07-2020T01:08:45,AspiringNoodle,*aliens emerge from their ships*
03-07-2020T01:08:56,AspiringNoodle,*all the aliens are shaped like giant pairs of boobs*
03-07-2020T01:09:02,AspiringNoodle,"""Oh no... we're DOOMED!!!"""
03-07-2020T01:09:38,AspiringNoodle,"Sorry, I couldn't help myself with the absurdity of that situation :ptv-laugh:"
03-07-2020T01:09:45,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-RainezZz: night night
03-07-2020T01:10:17,SageSaga,gnight Ord!
03-07-2020T01:10:23,AspiringNoodle,sleep tight~
03-07-2020T01:11:09,Dadrobit,o/ ord
03-07-2020T01:14:56,Werewing,"Yeah, dearth. And aren't the assistants usually distractions, not mind-alteration."
03-07-2020T01:15:17,Dadrobit,Same diff
03-07-2020T01:17:33,Dadrobit,Wait a second... Gelding dragon????
03-07-2020T01:17:42,Dadrobit,What???
03-07-2020T01:18:28,Dadrobit,Who the hell does that to a dragon? And why? And how???
03-07-2020T01:18:42,Werewing,Hmm. Maybe Gelding isn't quite correct.
03-07-2020T01:18:54,Werewing,He's firing blanks.
03-07-2020T01:18:58,Dadrobit,"I mean, I s'pose the ""how"" is pretty self exclamatory."
03-07-2020T01:19:16,Dadrobit,"Oh, so just born sterile or something?"
03-07-2020T01:19:49,AspiringNoodle,Night everyone~
03-07-2020T01:19:54,Werewing,"Yeah, just sterile, possibly sexless, but he is always referred to as male."
03-07-2020T01:20:02,Dadrobit,o/ noodle
03-07-2020T01:20:03,AspiringNoodle,Have fun chatting about dragon orgies or w/e the hell I missed O_o
03-07-2020T01:20:36,Werewing,Goodnight Aspiring.
03-07-2020T01:20:51,Dadrobit,Clearly I just need to read it. Answers birthing questions.
03-07-2020T01:21:29,Werewing,Birthing? They lay eggs in sand pits in giant arena-like structures.
03-07-2020T01:21:49,aeoronwah,"I am back, with 6 bottles of wine and some cider"
03-07-2020T01:21:53,Dadrobit,"Lol, not what I meant, but thanks for the answer!"
03-07-2020T01:22:50,Werewing,"Actually, it really is just an arena with sand. Lots of people watch the dragons hatch while the candidates try to woo the baby dragons."
03-07-2020T01:24:28,Werewing,It seems the old archmage is secretly hot--by which I mean on fire.
03-07-2020T01:25:10,Dadrobit,"Hmm, for all of Eragon's issues, I quite like how they handled dragon/rider selections."
03-07-2020T01:25:43,Werewing,Magic Lure combined with a hand brand?
03-07-2020T01:26:03,Dadrobit,"It's kinda ""driven by date"" which I normally don't like, but it worked there."
03-07-2020T01:26:13,Werewing,You mean fate?
03-07-2020T01:26:16,Dadrobit,Fate* not date
03-07-2020T01:26:19,Dadrobit,Ya
03-07-2020T01:26:42,Werewing,"Good, I don't need to imagine more Dragon/Rider slashfic."
03-07-2020T01:26:44,Dadrobit,Where the egg is brought among the people and the bind is made before birth.
03-07-2020T01:26:50,Dadrobit,Bond*
03-07-2020T01:27:10,Werewing,"Yeah, Pern does the same thing, basically."
03-07-2020T01:27:28,Werewing,Just doubles as a sporting event.
03-07-2020T01:27:48,Dadrobit,"Well, there was no ""wooing"" of the dragon in the Inheritance series is what I was focusing on."
03-07-2020T01:28:25,Werewing,"I said they try to woo them. It doesn't work, of course, it is implied they ""choose"" before they hatch."
03-07-2020T01:28:32,Dadrobit,Ahhh
03-07-2020T01:28:45,Dadrobit,"Again, I just need to read it."
03-07-2020T01:29:47,Dadrobit,Though I do need a bigger book case as well. Current one is almost at max capacity.
03-07-2020T01:30:37,SageSaga,Kindles are thin
03-07-2020T01:31:17,Werewing,"Yeah, there's a funny hatching that ends with one of the ""golden queens"" chasing her chosen out into the hallway, while all the onlookers and wannabe-riders panic in confusion."
03-07-2020T01:31:29,Dadrobit,Spoilers yoooioo
03-07-2020T01:31:53,Dadrobit,"No thanks, Sage. I prefer my books to be physical."
03-07-2020T01:32:12,SageSaga,Kindles are physical
03-07-2020T01:32:12,Dadrobit,24 books in the series is seriously gonna require a new book case.
03-07-2020T01:32:15,Werewing,"Sorry, I won't say who or the details."
03-07-2020T01:32:57,Dadrobit,Paper books don't run out of batteries or lock you to an outlet.
03-07-2020T01:33:07,Dadrobit,Also they smell better
03-07-2020T01:33:16,Werewing,Or risk being revoked if the service is cancelled or changes terms.
03-07-2020T01:33:27,SageSaga,you can put a leather cover on a kindle and it smells like many leatherbound books
03-07-2020T01:33:45,SageSaga,also it charges fast and via usb and the battery lasts for days of use
03-07-2020T01:34:11,SageSaga,i only recharge it once a week and use it hours each day
03-07-2020T01:34:24,SageSaga,and i never hook it up to an outlet
03-07-2020T01:34:32,Dadrobit,"I was gonna say paper books don't crack. But yeah, I have a couple old favorites with busted spines lol."
03-07-2020T01:34:51,Werewing,"Yeah, especially the big ones."
03-07-2020T01:34:59,SageSaga,bookshelves and space are too expensive
03-07-2020T01:35:15,SageSaga,and if my house burns down- i can just download all my books again
03-07-2020T01:35:45,Dadrobit,"Some old ones that are like 40+ years and are pleasantly yellowed, those poor spines lol..."
03-07-2020T01:36:16,SageSaga,you can set it to nighttime mode and get that yellow color :P
03-07-2020T01:36:30,Dadrobit,Heheh
03-07-2020T01:37:39,Werewing,The texture of the paper.
03-07-2020T01:38:20,SpazztasticKiwi,finger a paperback while you read
03-07-2020T01:38:21,Werewing,"Not so fun if they are damp, but when they are dry and crisp and there's that near-psychosexual component of tingling feeling the paper on your fingertips."
03-07-2020T01:38:34,Dadrobit,The feeling of the left hand slowly getting heavier the further into the book you get.
03-07-2020T01:38:39,Werewing,"I see we have similar thoughts, spazz."
03-07-2020T01:38:50,SpazztasticKiwi,I read on my phone but I have hard copies of the good stuff
03-07-2020T01:39:06,BadFoMo,"As much as I want to make a joke about having multipul Kindels (one per book), I have to add 'your books being taken away due to someone with power banning that book' @Werewing 's list. ...Also, I can't think of a good way to word the joke."
03-07-2020T01:39:20,SpazztasticKiwi,if anyone can find a place that sells a nice of mice & men...
03-07-2020T01:40:01,SageSaga,what was the name of that event that happened in Ghost in the Shell? The one that wiped out all financial data-
03-07-2020T01:40:03,SpazztasticKiwi,I cave close to every other classic I want but that one
03-07-2020T01:40:16,SpazztasticKiwi,have
03-07-2020T01:40:50,SpazztasticKiwi,& I assure you we have different tastes
03-07-2020T01:41:18,BadFoMo,@SageSaga The Purge?
03-07-2020T01:41:40,Werewing,I have a few early modern classics.
03-07-2020T01:42:13,SpazztasticKiwi,is the music jumping for anyone else
03-07-2020T01:42:31,Werewing,"Well, the volume is everywhere, but I think that is just the song."
03-07-2020T01:42:43,SageSaga,was it called the Purge?
03-07-2020T01:43:23,Dadrobit,"Hmmm, $260 for a majority of the series in paperback with a couple extra books thrown in."
03-07-2020T01:43:43,BadFoMo,"@SageSaga Sorry, I don't actually know. I was trying to make a bad joke. One moment please."
03-07-2020T01:43:46,SpazztasticKiwi,logical I’m sure
03-07-2020T01:43:55,Dadrobit,One reviewer says they only got 3 of the books tho...
03-07-2020T01:44:14,SpazztasticKiwi,maaaaaybe nah then
03-07-2020T01:45:34,Dadrobit,Yeah nah
03-07-2020T01:46:22,SageSaga,There was like a global market blackout that erased all funds in digital markets- which was like - all of the money
03-07-2020T01:46:53,Dadrobit,S'gonna be a quest to get all the books. There doesn't seem to be a unified collection for sale like other series.
03-07-2020T01:46:54,SpazztasticKiwi,so many monies
03-07-2020T01:47:15,SpazztasticKiwi,so you’re on a quest to read the quest
03-07-2020T01:47:16,Dadrobit,And I'm seeing some books are out of print.
03-07-2020T01:47:26,Werewing,I only vaguely recall that. I remember an AI made by a finance broker making money even after the broker died for a ludicrous amount of time.
03-07-2020T01:48:12,Dadrobit,"Not my first time, spazz. But never for 24 books. Most was like 8 for a present for my father a few years back."
03-07-2020T01:48:30,SpazztasticKiwi,an adventure!
03-07-2020T01:48:59,Dadrobit,\O/ I'm going on an adventure!
03-07-2020T01:49:24,Dadrobit,\o/*
03-07-2020T01:50:11,Dadrobit,An expensive adventure....
03-07-2020T01:50:32,Dadrobit,"Gonna get a bonus on the 17th tho, so I guess I can subsidize it lol."
03-07-2020T01:52:49,SageSaga,brb
03-07-2020T01:52:56,Dadrobit,Kk
03-07-2020T01:53:26,aeoronwah,I'm halfway through my bottle of wine :(
03-07-2020T01:54:43,Werewing,All of them or just the first?
03-07-2020T01:54:54,BadFoMo,"Sorry, I can't find /any/ GitS lore on a financial wipe."
03-07-2020T01:55:08,aeoronwah,Just the first
03-07-2020T01:55:17,aeoronwah,But I really like this wine and only got 1 of them
03-07-2020T01:55:56,Werewing,"""After a global financial crisis, the world is engulfed in an AI-driven ""sustainable war."" It's up to Section 9 to counter new forms of cyber threats. Watch all you want."" is the description for the Netflix reboot."
03-07-2020T01:56:10,Werewing,So maybe it doesn't have a proper name?
03-07-2020T02:14:26,SageSaga,sorry about that- apparently at some point today i got on the pain train and they wont let me off
03-07-2020T02:15:08,aeoronwah,you what
03-07-2020T02:15:36,SageSaga,I told them I didnt even have a ticket to ride the pain train but they said I had a lifetime pass
03-07-2020T02:15:46,Werewing,Arthritis?
03-07-2020T02:15:47,aeoronwah,damn
03-07-2020T02:16:20,SageSaga,no i dont have arthritis
03-07-2020T02:19:50,Dadrobit,Hot damn people are fuckin stupid
03-07-2020T02:19:59,SageSaga,yep
03-07-2020T02:20:09,Dadrobit,Just let in an Uber driver and wished him a happy 4th.
03-07-2020T02:20:35,SageSaga,and he said 4th of what?
03-07-2020T02:20:53,Dadrobit,"Dude snapped at me. ""How dare you try to talk about celebrating freedom when you threw yours away!!!"""
03-07-2020T02:21:07,aeoronwah,4th of what is me
03-07-2020T02:21:08,Dadrobit,Dude was not happy I was wearing my mask.
03-07-2020T02:21:12,aeoronwah,I'm that dumb
03-07-2020T02:21:21,aeoronwah,"bruh, its a mask....."
03-07-2020T02:21:49,SageSaga,"""What? But your girlfriend loves it with the mask on!"""
03-07-2020T02:22:18,Dadrobit,Just shrugged and told him to have a happy 4th anyways.
03-07-2020T02:22:32,aeoronwah,quick question dadrobit
03-07-2020T02:22:35,aeoronwah,4th of what
03-07-2020T02:22:54,Dadrobit,July?
03-07-2020T02:23:30,aeoronwah,That was funnier in my head
03-07-2020T02:23:37,SageSaga,XD
03-07-2020T02:23:56,Werewing,I wonder if the response would have been nicer if you dressed up as Jason or Leatherface.
03-07-2020T02:24:00,aeoronwah,sorry im a little drunk
03-07-2020T02:24:07,SageSaga,np
03-07-2020T02:24:16,Werewing,BRB- Rituals must be observed.
03-07-2020T02:24:29,aeoronwah,this wine is pretty good though
03-07-2020T02:24:48,Dadrobit,Nah Were. Uniforms must be.... Well... Uniform. No clothing or coverings that aren't approved and issued.
03-07-2020T02:25:20,Dadrobit,Not even little flag buttons.
03-07-2020T02:25:39,aeoronwah,wow
03-07-2020T02:28:51,SageSaga,"when the whole Corona thing started i was like ""Man- i hope even people i dont like dont get this mess-"" but now im kinda like - hoping that a lot of these idiots do- like that woman bashing into that bar door and licking it-"
03-07-2020T02:29:10,aeoronwah,WHAT
03-07-2020T02:29:16,aeoronwah,LICKING IT???
03-07-2020T02:29:23,SageSaga,yeah
03-07-2020T02:29:32,SageSaga,she just started going ham on the door glass
03-07-2020T02:29:40,aeoronwah,even without a pandemic thats a bad idea
03-07-2020T02:29:45,SageSaga,yeeeeah
03-07-2020T02:30:07,SageSaga,she almost knocked herself out too trying to bash her way in
03-07-2020T02:30:38,aeoronwah,oh my god
03-07-2020T02:30:49,SageSaga,i can message people the link who wanna see it
03-07-2020T02:30:55,aeoronwah,I wanna see it
03-07-2020T02:31:02,Dadrobit,"On the bright-ish side, you're starting to see stories of people on deaths door who are saying ""man, I really regret going to that Coronavirus party"" the day before they pass."
03-07-2020T02:31:21,SageSaga,anyone else?
03-07-2020T02:31:23,Dadrobit,So maybe it gets through to some of them

03-07-2020T02:32:51,aeoronwah,I'm drunk but I wouldn't go around licking a door of a bar
03-07-2020T02:33:00,Dadrobit,"Remember, she votes. Do you?"
03-07-2020T02:33:01,aeoronwah,the trumper part must be it
03-07-2020T02:33:08,aeoronwah,Yeah I vote
03-07-2020T02:33:15,Dadrobit,o7

03-07-2020T02:36:09,ZRO4825,This song sounds so 80s.

03-07-2020T02:40:24,Dadrobit,:( I can't hear but every 6 seconds a snippet of sound.
03-07-2020T02:40:59,SageSaga,here it is
03-07-2020T02:41:21,Dadrobit,"But to me, ""80's"" music sounds like electric guitars over wild synths with a snare drum synced to a whine noise generator lol."
03-07-2020T02:41:45,SageSaga,yeah i dont think this sounds 80s
03-07-2020T02:41:49,Dadrobit,"Well, it's got the snare and the synth pads at least lol."
03-07-2020T02:41:59,aeoronwah,"Yeah no, this doesn't dound 80s at all"
03-07-2020T02:42:02,aeoronwah,still sounds good though
03-07-2020T02:42:22,ZRO4825,"lemme rephrase, 80s Anime, lol"
03-07-2020T02:42:37,SageSaga,nope
03-07-2020T02:42:45,SageSaga,too much modern remixing
03-07-2020T02:42:46,Dadrobit,"Can you link the song, I really can't hear much >."

03-07-2020T02:58:25,SageSaga,XD
03-07-2020T02:58:25,ZRO4825,:ptv-confused:
03-07-2020T02:58:45,Dadrobit,Spotify has decided to take me on a wild ride.
03-07-2020T02:59:24,ZRO4825,I hear it likes to do that.
03-07-2020T02:59:31,Dadrobit,Some Japanese light metal/dubstep shenanigans
03-07-2020T03:00:05,SageSaga,yeah- Spotify recommended some song to me- i started playing it and stopped it when the singer talked about getting creampied- and not the sugary snack kind
03-07-2020T03:00:08,Dadrobit,She's got a hella flow though
03-07-2020T03:00:43,Dadrobit,I faved it
03-07-2020T03:01:00,Dadrobit,RIP my Spotify algorithm
03-07-2020T03:01:52,aeoronwah,LOL Sage
03-07-2020T03:03:01,SageSaga,i admit- some of the japanese songs could be saying some crazy stuff too- but that was in english
03-07-2020T03:05:05,Dadrobit,Reminds me of an opposite incident with my mother and a Tool album I had in my car.
03-07-2020T03:05:39,aeoronwah,Oh?
03-07-2020T03:05:53,aeoronwah,Wait when did it become 4th of july

03-07-2020T03:06:17,SageSaga,time passes
03-07-2020T03:06:18,aeoronwah,i swear it was like 9pm
03-07-2020T03:06:59,aeoronwah,does time pass sage?
03-07-2020T03:07:50,Dadrobit,Die Eier Von Satan in the Ænema album. It's a song about baking sugar cookies without eggs. But it's sung very aggressively with a chanting crowd in the background.
03-07-2020T03:08:01,SageSaga,close enough that theres no point arguing over the semantics of it- yes
03-07-2020T03:08:18,Werewing,"GN peeps. And remember, some idiots hold Corona-catching parties."
03-07-2020T03:08:23,Dadrobit,"So my mother was like, ""wtf are you listening to this? Is this Nazi propoganda???"""
03-07-2020T03:08:37,Dadrobit,"Nah mom, it's just sugar cookies, cool your heels."
03-07-2020T03:08:52,Dadrobit,o/ were

03-07-2020T03:09:19,Dadrobit,Lemme check
03-07-2020T03:09:57,SageSaga,because thats what makes the cookie thing neo nazi holocaust denier territory
03-07-2020T03:10:02,aeoronwah,what time is it where yall are at

03-07-2020T03:11:20,Dadrobit,"A bit over a pound of dough, so however many you want to make with that much."
03-07-2020T03:11:53,Dadrobit,"But remember, no eggs!"
03-07-2020T03:12:04,aeoronwah,"word of advice yall, dont move to alaska, its pretty here but livin here sucks"

03-07-2020T03:12:44,aeoronwah,Jesus
03-07-2020T03:13:33,SageSaga,yeah if you hear someone saying that its not possible for someone to cook that many cookies in X years - you are dealing with a Nazi
03-07-2020T03:14:02,SageSaga,or a holocaust denier and lets be fair- they are basically the same thing
03-07-2020T03:15:21,aeoronwah,Yeah
03-07-2020T03:16:28,Dadrobit,"All Holocaust deniers are Nazis, but not all Nazis are Holocaust deniers. /MildSarcadm"
03-07-2020T03:16:36,Dadrobit,Sarcasm*
