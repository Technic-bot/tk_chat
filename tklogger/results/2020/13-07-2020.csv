13-07-2020T18:26:14,SpazztasticKiwi,if Trace is trying to revive saria.....is her body in the mansion
13-07-2020T18:26:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"cause trace, that’s how you get zombies"

13-07-2020T18:33:07,CrRAR,lil EXTRA freaky I admit tho

13-07-2020T18:35:09,AspiringNoodle,I think Saria *is* buried somewhere
13-07-2020T18:35:21,AspiringNoodle,But I don't think she's buried near the mansion
13-07-2020T18:35:29,CrRAR,We saw her grave
13-07-2020T18:35:41,AspiringNoodle,I think it's closer to that little cottage near the border
13-07-2020T18:35:50,CrRAR,yeah
13-07-2020T18:36:39,CrRAR,For soe reason I always remember it at out back an inn/tavern for some reason cuz that's what their travels consisted of that early in the comic
13-07-2020T18:36:55,CrRAR,Which would be highly disrespectful and hilarious
13-07-2020T18:37:11,SpazztasticKiwi,a grave doesn’t mean a body
13-07-2020T18:37:17,CrRAR,true
13-07-2020T18:37:37,CrRAR,...but if you were a ghost wouldn't you stay near your body?
13-07-2020T18:37:50,CrRAR,like to protect it?
13-07-2020T18:38:35,SpazztasticKiwi,"depends if they know they’re dead, if they had a violent or sudden death, if they slipped away, or if they can remember where their body is"
13-07-2020T18:38:55,SpazztasticKiwi,if that’s what the rules for the dead are
13-07-2020T18:39:38,SpazztasticKiwi,& what’s to protect it from?
13-07-2020T18:39:40,SpazztasticKiwi,worms?
13-07-2020T18:39:45,CrRAR,hahaha
13-07-2020T18:40:26,CrRAR,I feel like we might get a flashback maybe
13-07-2020T18:41:14,SpazztasticKiwi,"if you’re effectively a ball of gas, a body seems less than helpful"
13-07-2020T18:41:35,SpazztasticKiwi,"if ghosts can move things with energy or their hands,"
13-07-2020T18:41:54,SpazztasticKiwi,"but if they need hands, a body is good"
13-07-2020T18:42:23,CrRAR,"true, I guess I'd be a little sentimental for a little while then all ew, gross."
13-07-2020T18:42:39,CrRAR,time for adventure!

13-07-2020T18:44:50,CrRAR,Boy
13-07-2020T18:44:58,CrRAR,Ghost you can sure hold a grudge
13-07-2020T18:45:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Freddy Krueger @ Trace like “dude...you fked up”
13-07-2020T18:52:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"actually, how about an intervention featuring Jason, Freddy, Michael, & Leatherface"
13-07-2020T18:52:54,CrRAR,I don't think that would go so good
13-07-2020T18:53:08,SpazztasticKiwi,"“we’re here because you’ve scared us, Trace...US”"

13-07-2020T19:58:58,Ordithus,haha that is outta left field
13-07-2020T19:59:21,Ordithus,:eyes: I see
13-07-2020T20:04:28,CrRAR,sounds like quite the ritual

13-07-2020T20:05:28,Ordithus,my pizza barely fit in the oven
13-07-2020T20:09:22,CrRAR,"fold in half, make giant pizza pocket"
13-07-2020T20:10:24,SpazztasticKiwi,if you can’t fit it in an oven no normal girl is gonna want it
13-07-2020T20:11:27,SpazztasticKiwi,dunno if Tom would no that idea
13-07-2020T20:11:32,CrRAR,"yeah, carb alert"
13-07-2020T20:11:38,CrRAR,gotta be sensible
13-07-2020T20:13:05,CrRAR,I think he would wonder how they found themselves in such a predicament
13-07-2020T20:13:35,CrRAR,Wait is maren the bull in that scenario?
13-07-2020T20:14:37,CrRAR,with Maren hair it's look like an emo bull
13-07-2020T20:14:43,CrRAR,*it'd
13-07-2020T20:14:55,CrRAR,especially with the signature bell nose ring
13-07-2020T20:14:59,CrRAR,bull
13-07-2020T20:17:51,SpazztasticKiwi,what’s his thing with carbs
13-07-2020T20:18:02,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s like you could rob the guy with a piece of bread
13-07-2020T20:18:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Maren is the bullfighter
13-07-2020T20:18:49,SpazztasticKiwi,why else would she be waving her..ahem..”cape”

13-07-2020T20:20:15,SpazztasticKiwi,"nah, she’d be a smartass and say “who’s a good boy?”"
13-07-2020T20:20:36,SpazztasticKiwi,which gives me another idea
13-07-2020T20:21:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Sythe is feeling a little down & maren awkwardly tries to offer nice words but says “you’re a good boy”
13-07-2020T20:22:17,SpazztasticKiwi,and then understandably agrees with Sythe that it never happened....while ignoring his tail thump
13-07-2020T20:32:50,CrRAR,yis
13-07-2020T20:48:38,Dadrobit,"Maren awkwarldy cheering up Sythe with, ""who's a good boy? Who's a good boy? You are!"" chants? I'm 110% behind that idea."

13-07-2020T20:49:24,AspiringNoodle,The awkwardness compels me
