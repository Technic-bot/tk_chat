05-05-2020T00:01:37,SpazztasticKiwi,:ptv-snicker: ...I got more from the same shop
05-05-2020T00:01:53,SpazztasticKiwi,if you want to see those too
05-05-2020T00:05:52,AspiringNoodle,"Kiwi, 3 more plants and I might as well call you Poison Ivy"
05-05-2020T00:16:58,SpazztasticKiwi,v important question tho: what is the perfect chunk size for apple pie
05-05-2020T00:17:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Ivy has red hair
05-05-2020T00:28:19,AspiringNoodle,"I love fiction writing, lol"
05-05-2020T00:29:15,AspiringNoodle,"Context: SCP entry, banter between members of a specialized task force about to explore a building that suddenly appeared with anomalous topography, filled with various hostile entities and cognitohazards"
05-05-2020T00:29:52,AspiringNoodle,"AP-3 Ross: ""...Use your broadcasters if nobody is responding, and shoot anything that moves. (Pauses) Unless itâ€™s one of us, probably."""
05-05-2020T00:30:05,AspiringNoodle,"AP-3 Noah: ""Then definitely shoot."""
05-05-2020T00:30:13,AspiringNoodle,(Team laughs)
05-05-2020T00:52:43,SpazztasticKiwi,oook
05-05-2020T00:53:10,AspiringNoodle,"What, not a fan of deprecating humor?"
05-05-2020T01:07:56,AspiringNoodle,"Huh... apparently I have an interest in voice acting, but not a professional interest, haha"
05-05-2020T01:12:06,JojoGD,I got a 65% in Theory of Everything 2
05-05-2020T01:12:39,AspiringNoodle,I was doing my take on an anomalous clown held in a cell inside an anomalous Site from an alternate universe c:
05-05-2020T01:12:52,AspiringNoodle,SCP is fun :ptv-hearts:
05-05-2020T01:22:24,johnnytho,I like SCP
05-05-2020T01:30:00,AspiringNoodle,SCP-1730 is fascinating
05-05-2020T01:30:36,AspiringNoodle,"It's Site-13 from an alternate universe.  One where at least one Site Director is less than ethical.  To be honest, calling him an a-hole would be too kind."
05-05-2020T01:47:14,SpazztasticKiwi,"in all stories, you have to have someone to hate"
05-05-2020T01:49:48,AspiringNoodle,Not necessarily :P
05-05-2020T01:50:06,AspiringNoodle,SCP doesn't often have things to actively hate :P
05-05-2020T01:50:44,AspiringNoodle,"Most of the time, it's just stuff with anomalous properties.  One of the cooler ones I can think of is a red fox that's made entirely of super-heated plasma"
05-05-2020T01:51:16,AspiringNoodle,That's basically it.  It behaves like a normal fox.  It just happens to be very destructive due to the nature of its form xD
05-05-2020T01:51:58,AspiringNoodle,"There was another one I read, I can't remember the number, where we're actually the bad guys"
05-05-2020T01:52:49,AspiringNoodle,"An alternate universe (one presumably without the foundation and the fun little threat of SCPs) is like us almost entirely.  The languages are different, but they're human."
05-05-2020T01:53:27,AspiringNoodle,"The difference is that they are scientifically far more advanced than us in fields such as mathematics and physics, but woefully behind in fields like chemistry and biology."
05-05-2020T01:55:01,AspiringNoodle,"They created a wormhole that connected our universes and we start communicating, eventually there's a slowdown in communication because their planet is currently experiencing a pandemic.  Not a very threatening one, but definitely enough to muck things up"
05-05-2020T01:55:16,AspiringNoodle,Oh the coincidental timing of me reading this entry! Haha.
05-05-2020T01:56:10,AspiringNoodle,Turns out that it's nothing more than a variation of the Flu.  So the SCP scientists create a vaccine and send it back through.  It's proven effective and is provided to the entirety of their planet.
05-05-2020T01:57:05,AspiringNoodle,But it came with a HUGE downside.  It dropped fertility rates to extinction-causing levels.  At one point they had only 1000 live births across the entire planet for a single day.
05-05-2020T01:57:39,AspiringNoodle,"So, we, trying to be helpful (and arrogant for thinking it would be so easy) doomed an entire planet.  And so they vow revenge on us."
05-05-2020T02:02:50,SpazztasticKiwi,....alrighty an answer to a question I never asked
05-05-2020T02:03:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I only have attention for the horror creatures
05-05-2020T02:04:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I have a box set of creature of lore from around the world
05-05-2020T02:06:36,SpazztasticKiwi,kinda like scp but these things are myth and legend and religious forms
05-05-2020T02:16:49,SpazztasticKiwi,there is a zoo that at one time featured the most dangerous animal
05-05-2020T02:16:54,SpazztasticKiwi,twas a mirror
05-05-2020T02:31:33,AspiringNoodle,HAHAHAHAHA classic
05-05-2020T02:43:04,SpazztasticKiwi,"but it goes along with that scp universe thing, donâ€™t you think"
05-05-2020T02:43:40,AspiringNoodle,Indeed.
05-05-2020T02:43:53,SpazztasticKiwi,"humans trying to help humans but by interacting/interfering at all, they accelerate chaos"
05-05-2020T02:44:17,SpazztasticKiwi,"or at least, they try to help with too much too fast"
05-05-2020T02:44:17,AspiringNoodle,"Honestly, the wiki is the ultimate time killer.  Literally thousands of entries, ranging from cute / silly to can destroy the universe."
05-05-2020T02:44:26,SpazztasticKiwi,I know of it
05-05-2020T02:44:42,AspiringNoodle,SCP-999 is the cutest / least harmful thing I can think of
05-05-2020T02:44:56,AspiringNoodle,It's literally a blob that smells nice and just wants to play with people and make them happy
05-05-2020T02:45:11,AspiringNoodle,The worst that'll happen is it'll tickle you for too long until you have trouble breathing.
05-05-2020T02:45:39,SpazztasticKiwi,"I once saw someone propose the idea of a cat, but it has the ability to move and appear in random places at will without detection or anyone noticing or even any evidence"
05-05-2020T02:45:53,SpazztasticKiwi,somebody commented that this was literally any cat
05-05-2020T02:45:59,AspiringNoodle,HA
05-05-2020T02:46:16,AspiringNoodle,Don't let the agents know.  Can't let them find out about the best glitch in the Matrix ;P
05-05-2020T02:46:48,AspiringNoodle,Here's a good one I remember
05-05-2020T02:47:14,AspiringNoodle,"SCP-504.  Aka ""Critical Tomatoes"""
05-05-2020T02:47:22,AspiringNoodle,Three guesses what it is / does
05-05-2020T02:48:29,SpazztasticKiwi,itâ€™s 3 fruits
05-05-2020T02:49:31,AspiringNoodle,half right
05-05-2020T02:53:48,SpazztasticKiwi,arenâ€™t tomatoes one of those fruit but also a vegetable
05-05-2020T02:54:00,SpazztasticKiwi,or is it really more who you ask
05-05-2020T02:54:26,SpazztasticKiwi,the name makes me think of those cherry bombs on plants vs zombies
05-05-2020T02:54:28,AspiringNoodle,"In a technical sense, they are a fruit"
05-05-2020T02:54:46,AspiringNoodle,But for economic / trade reasons they're listed as a vegetable due to how they're used.
05-05-2020T02:55:14,AspiringNoodle,"Iirc, this was actually a court case a LONG time ago."
05-05-2020T02:55:37,AspiringNoodle,Oh shiz
05-05-2020T02:55:41,AspiringNoodle,Nix v. Hedden (1893)
05-05-2020T02:56:14,AspiringNoodle,It was a legitimate Supreme Court case that dictated tomatoes be considered a vegetable by customs
05-05-2020T03:03:38,AspiringNoodle,Anyways...
05-05-2020T03:03:43,AspiringNoodle,They're tomatoes
05-05-2020T03:03:57,AspiringNoodle,That launch themselves at you when you make an attempt at humor :D
05-05-2020T03:04:37,AspiringNoodle,The results of which can range from nothing more than what you'd expect from a heckler to [REDACTED]
05-05-2020T03:17:19,SpazztasticKiwi,so theyâ€™re sentient bad comedian bombs
05-05-2020T03:17:40,SpazztasticKiwi,no angry audience required to be thrown at a bad joke
05-05-2020T03:21:55,AspiringNoodle,"What's extra funny is during a test session, they showed a tomato a comedy skit from SNL.  It was based around Hillary Clinton, but I can't remember what specifically it was about."
05-05-2020T03:22:30,AspiringNoodle,"In short, the tomato proceeded to accelerate, stop, and reverse course in no particular order multiple times throughout the skit at very high velocity"
05-05-2020T03:22:42,AspiringNoodle,"Seemingly unable to determine if it was ""funny"" or not."
05-05-2020T03:27:24,SpazztasticKiwi,ðŸ›Œ
05-05-2020T03:28:58,AspiringNoodle,Have a good slep

05-05-2020T15:36:02,CrimsonQuill,And I need to wait till my clothes wash before I can enjoy TK stuff
05-05-2020T15:36:09,CrimsonQuill,I'm weird like that
05-05-2020T15:36:18,CrimsonQuill,"But after that...Sweet, sweet freedom"

05-05-2020T15:40:06,AspiringNoodle,"I do want to at least try asking him to do stuff, but I'm not a supervisor, so I don't have the authority to make him do anything :/"
05-05-2020T15:40:06,CrimsonQuill,And taking a cuppa tea and relaxing for a bit
05-05-2020T15:40:10,CrimsonQuill,Before study

05-05-2020T15:42:26,CrimsonQuill,Well...any luck with other careers?
05-05-2020T15:42:37,AspiringNoodle,I spent most of this weekend playing Dark Souls >_>
05-05-2020T15:43:02,JojoGD,I need to finish my art assignment -_-
05-05-2020T15:43:18,CrimsonQuill,Wish I had art
05-05-2020T15:43:36,JojoGD,I didn't learn anything
05-05-2020T15:48:47,AspiringNoodle,But yeah... I feel like the job stresses me out so much that I end up spending all my free time relaxing...
05-05-2020T15:48:54,AspiringNoodle,And I only work 2 days a week ffs
05-05-2020T15:49:27,AspiringNoodle,"The whole store structure is FUBAR, and I pity anybody who works there when I leave."
05-05-2020T15:49:41,JojoGD,I talked to my old friend from elementary. He's boring to talk to
05-05-2020T15:49:56,JojoGD,I got his phone number yesterday

05-05-2020T16:02:07,JojoGD,And when your not looking for it you do
05-05-2020T16:02:43,CrimsonQuill,Same here.
05-05-2020T16:02:57,CrimsonQuill,"When I don't need 'em, they're all over the place"
05-05-2020T16:03:00,JojoGD,Its a 38 gallon bin

05-05-2020T16:06:07,CrimsonQuill,Pity the parts are lost in the pile
05-05-2020T16:06:36,JojoGD,well i have to rebuild it
05-05-2020T16:06:48,AspiringNoodle,"Lol, I'm remembering a random planet dolan music video that seems appropriate"
05-05-2020T16:07:13,JojoGD,i feel like the fastest way to rebuild it is to seperate every single part by color

05-05-2020T16:09:22,CrimsonQuill,How hard is it to wash?>
05-05-2020T16:09:36,CrimsonQuill,Because I want to try growing my hair long-ish over time.
05-05-2020T16:09:38,AspiringNoodle,"Half a bottle, every time :P"
05-05-2020T16:09:51,IronHorseComics,good news is that I'm like 90% done with one Fluffy 500 page and 95% done with another
05-05-2020T16:09:55,Twokinds,Long hair is a pain in the butt

05-05-2020T16:10:13,CrimsonQuill,"In that case, I might...not...grow it long then"
05-05-2020T16:10:15,Twokinds,I have to wash it pretty often and use a lot of conditioner or it gets tangled and gross.
05-05-2020T16:10:34,CrimsonQuill,Wheesh. Must be painful to comb.
05-05-2020T16:10:51,CrimsonQuill,Oh yeah
05-05-2020T16:10:55,Twokinds,Oh yeah.
05-05-2020T16:11:00,JojoGD,the reason why i cut my hair instead of growing hit
05-05-2020T16:11:02,Twokinds,I meant to get it all cut off before... well...
05-05-2020T16:11:08,CrimsonQuill,I can actually feel the pain now...
05-05-2020T16:11:13,IronHorseComics,it becomes a literal pain in the butt
05-05-2020T16:11:17,CrimsonQuill,Well

05-05-2020T16:11:26,CrimsonQuill,I had a nice head of hair
05-05-2020T16:11:39,CrimsonQuill,"But I got a cut on my head, panicked, and sliced chunks off"
05-05-2020T16:11:53,CrimsonQuill,A housemate had to help me with a scissors and razor to get it off.
05-05-2020T16:12:05,CrimsonQuill,So it's slowly growing back...now it's nice brown fuzz
05-05-2020T16:12:26,iliar,"Oh yeah. I recently returned from a hospital where it was not possible to wash long hair. It was terrible. For a long time in the hospital, the hair turned into one big knot."
05-05-2020T16:12:44,CrimsonQuill,Is there any chance you could just take a scissors and...cut off a certain length by slicking it back?
05-05-2020T16:13:02,JojoGD,I have curly hair and combing it when it was long was a pain
05-05-2020T16:13:04,CrimsonQuill,"Just enough so that it's managable, but still looks okay?"
05-05-2020T16:13:24,JojoGD,I had a dam afro
05-05-2020T16:13:35,IronHorseComics,I'm long due for a hair cut
05-05-2020T16:13:35,CrimsonQuill,"Maybe make a mega-braid, like Raine's in chapter 19, and cut it from there....come to think of it, her hair must be tricky for her to deal with tooi"
05-05-2020T16:13:48,CrimsonQuill,My friend has shoulder length curly hair
05-05-2020T16:14:12,JojoGD,Mine gets wild
05-05-2020T16:14:56,iliar,"Technically, I could. But when you have hair to the middle of your back... cutting it off is not what you want to do."
05-05-2020T16:15:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Iâ€™ve yet to see a single squirrel at the park
05-05-2020T16:15:23,JojoGD,If i were to let it grow out again. I would only let the top and back grow out
05-05-2020T16:15:40,SpazztasticKiwi,but thereâ€™s a family having a convention in the track
05-05-2020T16:16:01,CrimsonQuill,Hi there Spazztastic
05-05-2020T16:16:10,JojoGD,hi spazz
05-05-2020T16:18:21,CrimsonQuill,Hmmm
05-05-2020T16:18:27,CrimsonQuill,Should I colour my picture....
05-05-2020T16:18:38,CrimsonQuill,Or make myself angry over Halo Reach Legendary?
05-05-2020T16:18:40,CrimsonQuill,...
05-05-2020T16:19:35,Dadrobit,God Fuckkin Damn It....
05-05-2020T16:19:39,Dadrobit,I hate my state sometimes.
05-05-2020T16:19:43,CrimsonQuill,"Oh hi Dadrobit,"
05-05-2020T16:19:46,Dadrobit,o/
05-05-2020T16:19:47,CrimsonQuill,What's wrong?
05-05-2020T16:20:11,Dadrobit,We may have the single dumbest asshole for a Governor in the union.
05-05-2020T16:20:22,CrimsonQuill,Ah.
05-05-2020T16:20:32,CrimsonQuill,I think I see broadly where this is going
05-05-2020T16:20:39,SpazztasticKiwi,hey now thereâ€™s others in the running for that position
05-05-2020T16:21:20,Dadrobit,Our Emergency Disaster Management Director was forced to resign at the beginning of this whole debacle because he wouldn't listen to her.
05-05-2020T16:22:01,CrimsonQuill,Uh oh
05-05-2020T16:22:02,Dadrobit,"Then he gives the weakest stay at home order of all time ""Stay at home unless you want to go out for golfing with friends or other activities like that"""
05-05-2020T16:22:18,CrimsonQuill,You have got to be joking.
05-05-2020T16:22:29,JojoGD,bruh
05-05-2020T16:22:37,AspiringNoodle,State cases finally exploding?
05-05-2020T16:22:44,SpazztasticKiwi,thatâ€™s in a nutshell of what we got
05-05-2020T16:23:05,Dadrobit,"Then when the Cheetoh in chief visits our state yesterday for our mask production, we have our single highest death toll in a day (so far)."
05-05-2020T16:23:19,SpazztasticKiwi,cheetoh in chief
05-05-2020T16:24:05,Dadrobit,And the governor goes on to fucking order that the scientists at our universities stop doing research on the virus and forbids them access to any new data.
05-05-2020T16:25:02,AspiringNoodle,Okay... that seems like a perfect reason for a revolt
05-05-2020T16:25:19,AspiringNoodle,"It's one thing to say, ""Okay, do whatever you want."""
05-05-2020T16:25:24,Dadrobit,And no I'm not kiding about the golf thing. That was one of his exceptions to the list of things not to do. He wanted people sto still be able to socialize... During orders for social distancing.
05-05-2020T16:25:30,AspiringNoodle,"It's another to say, ""You are not allowed to learn anything about this."""
05-05-2020T16:25:33,Dadrobit,people to*
05-05-2020T16:25:39,SpazztasticKiwi,what could possibly go wrong
05-05-2020T16:25:47,CrimsonQuill,I wanna rant
05-05-2020T16:25:51,CrimsonQuill,I'm not gonna rant
05-05-2020T16:25:56,AspiringNoodle,"I hope he gets a public hanging, metaphorically speaking"
05-05-2020T16:28:11,AspiringNoodle,*sigh*
05-05-2020T16:28:29,AspiringNoodle,"Let's be real, the people probably won't give a rat's ass about his orders until it blows up spectacularly in the state's face"
05-05-2020T16:28:35,Dadrobit,Ain't no revolutin happening here. Just last week anti-quarantine protesters brought weapons to the capitol to stage a protest. They got on loudspeakers and actively threatened to kill any new elected officials if they were democrats/ virus hoaxers.
05-05-2020T16:28:57,Dadrobit,The crowd fukkin cheered for those terrorist assholes.
05-05-2020T16:28:59,AspiringNoodle,"Okay, THAT'S grounds for the military to move in."
05-05-2020T16:29:16,AspiringNoodle,"Because that's a public threat of violence and, as you said, domestic terrorism"
05-05-2020T16:29:28,AspiringNoodle,"Perfect reason for martial law and for the FBI to pay those people a ""visit"""
05-05-2020T16:29:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Iâ€™ve heard someone rant that he had been to prison- so he wasnâ€™t scared of no Chinese virus
05-05-2020T16:29:59,Dadrobit,"Who's gonna send em? National Guard is controlled but Douchey, and the Army is controlled by the orange stain in the white house."
05-05-2020T16:30:05,Dadrobit,by Douchey*
05-05-2020T16:30:26,AspiringNoodle,"Technically, the army *could* oppose the US government."
05-05-2020T16:31:11,AspiringNoodle,"Their main objective is to protect the citizens / constitution.  If the government suddenly turned into a tyranny, they would have enough autonomy to go rogue"
05-05-2020T16:31:40,AspiringNoodle,"But in terms of domestic matters, you're right in that they'd need to be ordered in"
05-05-2020T16:32:00,SpazztasticKiwi,yeah unfortunately through all this....I have close to a dozen family members traveling to visit this weekend
05-05-2020T16:33:49,Dadrobit,"""If the government suddenly turned into a tyranny"" That was established February 5th of this year with a 48-52 vote."
05-05-2020T16:35:08,AspiringNoodle,Agree to disagree
05-05-2020T16:39:11,CrimsonQuill,Weelll
05-05-2020T16:39:15,CrimsonQuill,I am going to bed

05-05-2020T16:48:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I can get showing your car on the side of the road but people canâ€™t stop and look at the number to call without causing a wreak
05-05-2020T16:50:35,Dadrobit,"Oh man, did I mention when I went into HQ, on the way in there was an accident just a couple cars ahead of me right at the end of my drive?"
05-05-2020T16:50:51,Dadrobit,Right at the beginning of the tunnel...
05-05-2020T16:51:29,Dadrobit,Thank goodness I still keep CD's in my car.
05-05-2020T16:53:35,AspiringNoodle,Ha
05-05-2020T16:53:56,AspiringNoodle,"I just use the radio, lol"
05-05-2020T16:54:06,AspiringNoodle,Can you imagine?  A 26 yo who listens to the radio
05-05-2020T16:54:19,AspiringNoodle,I is freak :D
05-05-2020T16:54:48,Dadrobit,"I use the radio, but it doesn't work that well when you're halfway through a kilometer long tunnel underneath a major city."
05-05-2020T16:54:56,AspiringNoodle,"Ah, that is true"
05-05-2020T16:57:08,JojoGD,a lot of static
05-05-2020T16:58:58,IronHorseComics,"hey Tom, you got any advice on how to draw crowds *quickly*? I've got a lot of crowds to worry about in the next Fluffy 500 chapter"
05-05-2020T17:02:30,AspiringNoodle,Shapeless blobs that look *vaguely* humanoid
05-05-2020T17:02:32,AspiringNoodle,Boom
05-05-2020T17:04:33,IronHorseComics,"works fine at a distance, but not in the middle of a carnival"
05-05-2020T17:04:58,IronHorseComics,especially when the camera's IN the carnival at ground level
05-05-2020T17:06:41,AspiringNoodle,"Oh wait, you mean your characters actually go IN the carnival?"
05-05-2020T17:06:44,AspiringNoodle,"RIP, can't help"
05-05-2020T17:07:17,IronHorseComics,"yeah, I mean, why else would I ask?"
05-05-2020T17:07:26,AspiringNoodle,I is noodle
05-05-2020T17:07:33,AspiringNoodle,You know you shouldn't trust me!!! :snake:
05-05-2020T17:07:47,IronHorseComics,at least with grandstands I can just fill in with a solid color and then add multi-colored dots
05-05-2020T17:10:27,Dadrobit,"People are ugly, just draw them wrongish and claim you were going for realism?"
05-05-2020T17:11:09,Dadrobit,"Only partially joking, one of my favorite movies, ""Perfect Blue"" does that exact thing and it looks incredible."
05-05-2020T17:25:15,JojoGD,28% to 100% TOE2
05-05-2020T18:02:51,JojoGD,I got an 80%
05-05-2020T18:05:44,SpazztasticKiwi,my laptop froze at 100% update
05-05-2020T18:14:05,AspiringNoodle,Huh... people are contracting covid at home...
05-05-2020T18:14:11,AspiringNoodle,"Well, eff it, open everything up xD"
05-05-2020T18:14:28,AspiringNoodle,"In all seriousness, what?"
05-05-2020T18:15:00,AspiringNoodle,Time for more research!
05-05-2020T18:19:05,AspiringNoodle,"Just in case, Tom, quickly go outside, you're not safe at home :ptv-shock:"
05-05-2020T18:43:24,AspiringNoodle,*sigh* I hope my one coworker is doing alright
05-05-2020T18:43:33,AspiringNoodle,"Straight up, if she goes, I go."
05-05-2020T18:57:26,SpazztasticKiwi,how bad an idea is doing a pc reset
05-05-2020T19:03:08,AspiringNoodle,"During an update?  Very, but if it's frozen, then there's not much choice.  How long has it been stuck?"
05-05-2020T19:07:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I restarted the computer
05-05-2020T19:07:46,AspiringNoodle,"Also, how old is this laptop?"
05-05-2020T19:07:47,SpazztasticKiwi,after not restarting 3 or so times it opened up but audio & wifi are gone
05-05-2020T19:08:06,AspiringNoodle,Might be missing drivers then
05-05-2020T19:08:42,SpazztasticKiwi,I found the audio files and fixed them so sound is back but wifi connection detection is still gone & speech recognition wants a restart but wonâ€™t restart
05-05-2020T19:17:54,SpazztasticKiwi,drivers say theyâ€™re working
05-05-2020T19:18:07,SpazztasticKiwi,troubleshooter says thereâ€™s no problems
05-05-2020T19:19:40,CrRAR,of course it does :expressionless:
05-05-2020T19:20:08,SpazztasticKiwi,it wonâ€™t even let me turn on firewall
05-05-2020T19:20:34,AspiringNoodle,I remember when I first built my computer and tried using a microphone
05-05-2020T19:20:44,AspiringNoodle,I ear effed everybody in my lobbies :ptv-laugh:
05-05-2020T19:21:12,AspiringNoodle,Didn't have a driver installed so the noise coming out was a random assortment of signals the computer couldn't comprehend
05-05-2020T19:21:18,SpazztasticKiwi,it pays off to be nice to the techies in school
05-05-2020T19:21:27,SpazztasticKiwi,I have a friend that can maybe look at this
05-05-2020T19:22:58,CrRAR,Any weird apps in the Programs and Features in the Control Panel?
05-05-2020T19:23:13,CrRAR,I usually would just sort by date installed.
05-05-2020T19:23:26,CrRAR,in case it's anything weird like that
05-05-2020T19:23:35,SpazztasticKiwi,define weird apps
05-05-2020T19:23:47,CrRAR,Like ones just that you don't remember installing.
05-05-2020T19:24:09,SpazztasticKiwi,i havenâ€™t downloaded anything
05-05-2020T19:25:19,CrRAR,When did the weirdness start>
05-05-2020T19:25:26,CrRAR,?
05-05-2020T19:26:41,SpazztasticKiwi,like I just covered update froze at 100% so I had to restart
05-05-2020T19:28:20,CrRAR,How long was it stuck?
05-05-2020T19:28:54,CrRAR,Not much bad happens when you kill it sometimes rerunning the update it'll work eventually.
05-05-2020T19:29:09,SpazztasticKiwi,longer than necessary
05-05-2020T19:29:13,CrRAR,What I would normally do with a questionable PC is a disk check and an sfc /scannow in a cmd box afterward.
05-05-2020T19:29:38,CrRAR,the 2nd thing verifies and repairs Windows files.
05-05-2020T19:30:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I tried a scan & it never started
05-05-2020T19:30:42,CrRAR,I think you just have to run a cmd box as admin for the sfc thing.
05-05-2020T19:31:06,CrRAR,right click > run as admin
05-05-2020T19:32:09,CrRAR,"I've seen it help in certain situations, in Windows 10 they made i dumber to Disk Check, it's best to run it from cmd now as well."
05-05-2020T19:32:17,CrRAR,*it
05-05-2020T19:33:25,CrRAR,I think I always do one with the /r flag
05-05-2020T19:33:57,CrRAR,"That checks for bad sectors, I think it has to perform it on reboot."

05-05-2020T22:41:24,AspiringNoodle,"The problem was some weapon infusions eliminated stat scaling.  Weak in the end-game, but super strong at early levels where players will lack stats"
05-05-2020T22:41:51,AspiringNoodle,So it was possible for twink invaders to one-shot newbies.  Not exactly a fun experience.
05-05-2020T22:42:17,AspiringNoodle,"But DS2's ""fix"" introduced more problems which I am currently facing -3-"
05-05-2020T22:43:41,AspiringNoodle,"Ord, you play any of the Soulsborne games?"
05-05-2020T22:44:04,Ordithus,nope

05-05-2020T22:45:53,AspiringNoodle,"DS2 is a masterclass in what not to do, lol"

05-05-2020T23:42:17,JojoGD,I typed something and it showed. Refreshed the page and my comment was gone
05-05-2020T23:42:33,JojoGD,It stayed like that till the next stream
