14-06-2020T00:00:09,Ordithus,I think that's enough for a while
14-06-2020T00:00:13,Roughlandin,Agreed
14-06-2020T00:00:40,Roughlandin,Don't wear out a good thing
14-06-2020T00:01:04,Ordithus,feel the same way for the against glass
14-06-2020T00:01:05,steelabjur,"You could bring back the Person X wakes up between persons Y & Z, I thought those were cute."
14-06-2020T00:01:15,Roughlandin,"Was about to say the same thing, Ord"
14-06-2020T00:01:23,Ordithus,Willow's is a fun twist
14-06-2020T00:01:36,Roughlandin,Same with Adira's and Maeve's
14-06-2020T00:01:54,Roughlandin,And Maeve's was still pretty smexy
14-06-2020T00:02:10,Roughlandin,"Same with Adira, but that's mostly just Adira"
14-06-2020T00:02:35,Roughlandin,Adira could look sexy standing behind a grocery store checkout counter.
14-06-2020T00:02:44,Roughlandin,...Which she has.
14-06-2020T00:02:47,Ordithus,sexy is as sexy does
14-06-2020T00:02:50,SpazztasticKiwi,what about another nom portrait with Maeve
14-06-2020T00:02:57,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-natsducky:
14-06-2020T00:03:04,Ordithus,that'd be cute
14-06-2020T00:03:11,Roughlandin,Maeve noms Nora
14-06-2020T00:03:18,Ordithus,Continue the family tradition~
14-06-2020T00:03:29,SpazztasticKiwi,"to complete the good mornings, we‚Äôd need reni"
14-06-2020T00:03:36,KeefMcDerpface,yes
14-06-2020T00:03:54,SpazztasticKiwi,but I was trying to think if there was a Clovis against the glass or not
14-06-2020T00:04:05,KeefMcDerpface,"Wait, that was a suggest this stream, wasn't it?"
14-06-2020T00:04:19,KeefMcDerpface,GM Reni
14-06-2020T00:04:22,Roughlandin,I saw Laura against the glass
14-06-2020T00:04:24,SpazztasticKiwi,which had me wondering if I was remembering good morning Clovis
14-06-2020T00:04:29,Roughlandin,Didn't see good morning Reni
14-06-2020T00:04:33,KeefMcDerpface,huh
14-06-2020T00:04:37,Ordithus,https://twokinds.gallery/ for art search hijinks
14-06-2020T00:04:41,KeefMcDerpface,never mind then
14-06-2020T00:04:43,SpazztasticKiwi,which had me question if there WAS a gm Clovis
14-06-2020T00:04:50,Roughlandin,An excellent resource Ord
14-06-2020T00:05:17,Dadrobit,"Okay, I have made a decision. 2 hour nap."
14-06-2020T00:05:18,Roughlandin,Can't be a good morning Clovis because evil never sleeps
14-06-2020T00:05:25,Dadrobit,Nothing could possibly go wrong
14-06-2020T00:05:27,Roughlandin,Good luck Dad!
14-06-2020T00:05:28,KeefMcDerpface,"Okay Dad, bye"
14-06-2020T00:05:34,Ordithus,happy nap dadro
14-06-2020T00:06:59,Roughlandin,Blegh. Think I'm gonna hit the hay too. Another great stream everybody! See ya next week!
14-06-2020T00:07:00,SpazztasticKiwi,it all boiled down to what about a Clovis against the glass with sister
14-06-2020T00:07:02,Roughlandin,Night!
14-06-2020T00:07:10,Ordithus,night rough

14-06-2020T00:07:31,SpazztasticKiwi,‚úåüèª
14-06-2020T00:08:05,SpazztasticKiwi,all in all I missed even seeing suggestions this time
14-06-2020T00:08:15,SpazztasticKiwi,but I got one or two for Sunday
14-06-2020T00:08:47,Ordithus,I've been trying to get one of the girls in a sundress because cute
14-06-2020T00:09:33,Ordithus,But I've also been changing up the suggestions a lot
14-06-2020T00:10:22,steelabjur,Wasn't there a Maddie in a sundress standing in water?
14-06-2020T00:10:33,Ordithus,long ago yeah
14-06-2020T00:10:33,SpazztasticKiwi,yeeeesss maddie in a dress was good
14-06-2020T00:10:45,SpazztasticKiwi,who is it
14-06-2020T00:10:56,Ordithus,this https://www.deviantart.com/twokinds/art/Sundress-Maddie-790159334
14-06-2020T00:11:07,SpazztasticKiwi,I mean the other suggestion
14-06-2020T00:11:11,SpazztasticKiwi,new
14-06-2020T00:11:24,Ordithus,"oh, first attempt was Maren, today's was Sealeen"
14-06-2020T00:11:48,Ordithus,Almost suggested Erilas but figured no one would know who she was haha
14-06-2020T00:11:59,SpazztasticKiwi,they do now
14-06-2020T00:12:02,Ordithus,yep
14-06-2020T00:12:10,Ordithus,:cw0lfmare-Echolove:
14-06-2020T00:12:29,SpazztasticKiwi,the thirst was hard
14-06-2020T00:13:09,Ordithus,quite
14-06-2020T00:13:31,SpazztasticKiwi,but hey....Colin & Brutus
14-06-2020T00:13:45,SpazztasticKiwi,magic mike
14-06-2020T00:14:43,SpazztasticKiwi,human Colin tho made me think of kyo from fruits basket
14-06-2020T00:15:33,KeefMcDerpface,\o Night all. :ptv-sleepy:
14-06-2020T00:15:46,Ordithus,night keef
14-06-2020T00:16:00,SpazztasticKiwi,I can see that one getting colored too but they‚Äôre probably getting covered by beach erilas & dungeon master laura
14-06-2020T00:17:51,Ordithus,Kat usually does really well in the color votes
14-06-2020T00:19:04,BlackjackSec99,zzzzzzz
14-06-2020T00:19:05,Twokinds,"I'll be honest, I googled 'handsome anime boy' and created an amalgam of whatever came up XD"
14-06-2020T00:19:18,BlackjackSec99,O.O
14-06-2020T00:19:20,Ordithus,hehe
14-06-2020T00:19:27,Ordithus,did look quite anime
14-06-2020T00:20:58,Ordithus,keeping the characters as themselves when swapping species is a tall order
14-06-2020T00:21:10,Twokinds,For sure
14-06-2020T00:21:14,steelabjur,"He came out looking a bit like a high school quarterback, imo."
14-06-2020T00:21:26,Twokinds,It's especially hard when it's a character who has no head hair
14-06-2020T00:21:47,Twokinds,"Could make him bald, but you know, doesn't work for every character"
14-06-2020T00:21:57,Ordithus,wouldn't seem right
14-06-2020T00:21:59,Twokinds,Don't think Colin would be bald as a human
14-06-2020T00:22:27,steelabjur,Sythe with a skullet would probably work. ;p
14-06-2020T00:22:33,Ordithus,human Kat sure worked great - but you have been drawing her for eons
14-06-2020T00:26:30,Twokinds,Human kat is fun
14-06-2020T00:26:52,Twokinds,"I'm just surprised at the amount of suggestions asking for human versions of characters. It's not a lot, but more than I'd expect."
14-06-2020T00:26:59,Twokinds,"From, you know, mostly furries lol XD"
14-06-2020T00:27:25,Ordithus,and when I say they look better as humans no one argues :ctwokinds-keith8D:
14-06-2020T00:27:46,steelabjur,"Come for the fur, stay for the skin?"
14-06-2020T00:28:30,Ordithus,though we have had plenty of tiger trace and cat maren
14-06-2020T00:28:47,Ordithus,fox eric
14-06-2020T00:29:20,Ordithus,I guess that's expected though
14-06-2020T00:30:06,steelabjur,"Lots of gender shinanigens too, but again, expected."
14-06-2020T00:30:40,Ordithus,it will have gone too far once we have male human nibbly
14-06-2020T00:31:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"‚Äúfurry for the lack of clothes, human versions to see skin‚Äù?"
14-06-2020T00:32:13,SpazztasticKiwi,well I‚Äôd say that method worked Tom
14-06-2020T00:32:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Colin came out looking like kyo soma
14-06-2020T00:32:39,SpazztasticKiwi,without the red hair
14-06-2020T00:32:47,AspiringNoodle,TL;DR - This is Twokinds
14-06-2020T00:32:54,AspiringNoodle,Anything weird in the suggestions? Magic!

14-06-2020T01:57:27,Twokinds,I'm not sure why. I don't need it.
14-06-2020T01:57:36,Twokinds,I'll probably just glue random stuff together.

14-06-2020T01:58:22,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
14-06-2020T01:59:03,WINDOWS98SE,I bought a hot glue gun a few years ago to build a sound enclosure for my CCTV monitor.
14-06-2020T01:59:15,WINDOWS98SE,It was utter crap tho.
14-06-2020T01:59:30,WINDOWS98SE,Melter glue without pulling the trigger.

14-06-2020T02:02:15,AspiringNoodle,"Meanwhile, at Tom's house."
14-06-2020T02:02:49,AspiringNoodle,Tom no longer needs to leave the house.  The intense gravity of his glue-y shenanigans has caused a massive gravitation pull that myteriously sucks in anything he needs.
14-06-2020T02:05:02,SpazztasticKiwi,"keep in mind that they leak when they‚Äôre plugged in so if it‚Äôs loaded, don‚Äôt prop it on anything you‚Äôre not willing to lose"

14-06-2020T02:12:26,SpazztasticKiwi,maybe try that - I tested doing that with clay

14-06-2020T22:05:27,AspiringNoodle,I'm slowly starting to want a western omelette D:
14-06-2020T22:05:45,AspiringNoodle,Ironically one of the few dishes I'll eat with peppers in it
14-06-2020T22:05:56,Ordithus,peppers are yum
14-06-2020T22:10:03,AspiringNoodle,I find that they tend to overpower a dish
14-06-2020T22:10:35,AspiringNoodle,"I've eaten a lot of stuff with peppers listed as an ingredient at restaurants, but generally when I get the dish, that's all I can taste"
14-06-2020T22:11:00,AspiringNoodle,So I tend to be apprehensive about dishes with peppers.  Jalapenos are an exception though :)
14-06-2020T22:11:03,Ordithus,but do you like the peppers themselves
14-06-2020T22:11:25,AspiringNoodle,"I can.  But when all I can taste is the pepper, kinda ruins the dish for me"
14-06-2020T22:12:11,AspiringNoodle,"But if it serves as a note in the overall flavor, then I'm fine"
14-06-2020T22:33:28,SpazztasticKiwi,TOM coffee sold out in like
