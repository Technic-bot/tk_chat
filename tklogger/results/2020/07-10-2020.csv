07-10-2020T12:36:37,AspiringNoodle,Wow...
07-10-2020T12:37:14,AspiringNoodle,"So they recently opened a new Popeyes in my area.  It used to be a Long John Silvers, but they did some construction to enlarge the building and change the lot."
07-10-2020T12:37:33,CrRAR,Chikkinnnnn
07-10-2020T12:37:38,CrRAR,:ccrrar-chickcr:
07-10-2020T12:37:51,AspiringNoodle,"Shortly after opening, the lines for the place (and just the drive through, mind you) were so long, they were stretching onto various streets"
07-10-2020T12:38:21,AspiringNoodle,It got so bad that the cops actually had to come to the restaurant and try to figure out a solution because their customers were disrupting traffic xD
07-10-2020T12:38:39,AspiringNoodle,tl;dr got dang do we love Popeyes around hya.
07-10-2020T12:38:59,CrRAR,"Yeah, most of those chicken places are usually too far to drive to to have super often"
07-10-2020T12:39:08,CrRAR,KFC is like two towns over
07-10-2020T12:39:21,AspiringNoodle,"Where I live right now, KFC is ~20 min away"
07-10-2020T12:39:27,AspiringNoodle,Popeyes 25 or so.
07-10-2020T12:39:33,AspiringNoodle,The new one is about 15 min away.
07-10-2020T12:39:53,CrRAR,"Yeah, it’s always inconvenient enough to not be a regular place to visit"
07-10-2020T12:40:06,AspiringNoodle,"It's not just the distance, lol"
07-10-2020T12:40:17,CrRAR,15 mins isn’t bad
07-10-2020T12:40:47,AspiringNoodle,"The Popeyes I went to before is in a weird spot.  To come back home, when I leave the lot I need to cross 3 lanes of traffic just to get back on track"
07-10-2020T12:42:03,CrRAR,Oh yeah some places are like on one side of a on-ramp near a highway those are the worst
07-10-2020T12:42:13,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
07-10-2020T12:42:16,CrRAR,On like a one way parkway
07-10-2020T12:42:26,CrRAR,I’d drive that to go get lunch at work if it was good
07-10-2020T12:42:33,CrRAR,(15 mins)
07-10-2020T12:42:35,AspiringNoodle,This one is located along a main road that leads into the city
07-10-2020T12:43:12,AspiringNoodle,"So when trying to come back home, I usually get lucky and can pull out immediately.  Other times it can be a several minute wait for a break in the traffic."
07-10-2020T12:44:08,AspiringNoodle,"It's also in a weird financial area.  Like, LOVE the Popeyes, but you'd look at the neighborhood and you don't know if it's one of those areas you'd rather avoid or should come to more often, haha"
07-10-2020T12:58:46,CrimsonQuill,Eveni'
07-10-2020T12:58:49,CrimsonQuill,Hullo all
07-10-2020T12:59:02,CrimsonQuill,Chilling to a mug o' chicken soup and some hot cocoa
07-10-2020T12:59:13,CrimsonQuill,I made a MOTHERLOAD of soup and kompot yesterday.
07-10-2020T12:59:21,CrimsonQuill,Both pots were near overflowing.
07-10-2020T13:00:53,CrimsonQuill,"Still, it's an easy way to use up a chicken carcass...boil the bones to get the stock, leave to cool, throw away the bones, add the meat, onion, and enough potato to feed a crofter family in the 1840s for a week and you're done."
07-10-2020T13:01:30,CrRAR,yum

07-10-2020T13:02:19,CrimsonQuill,I can get SO MUCH TEA into that thing.
07-10-2020T13:02:39,CrRAR,Yeah those soup mugs are massive
07-10-2020T13:03:06,CrimsonQuill,Mine's a dad's army one that my father gave me for christmasx
07-10-2020T13:03:37,CrimsonQuill,"According to the War office levels guide, I am consuming 'Corporal' portions of soup. Well within acceptable home guard standard."
07-10-2020T13:09:11,CrimsonQuill,Just saw the Body swap...

07-10-2020T13:11:16,CrimsonQuill,"True that, I suppose."
07-10-2020T13:11:16,AspiringNoodle,"CURSE YOU, MAGICAL SHENANIGANS! :ptv-angry:"
07-10-2020T13:11:37,CrimsonQuill,I see no crime in Saria's furry-ness.
07-10-2020T13:11:46,TerraTheWizard,but i think it's more sarias open to more things
07-10-2020T13:11:54,AspiringNoodle,"Pfff, people who DON'T want fur and tails are the weird ones ;)"
07-10-2020T13:12:01,AspiringNoodle,Humans are weird.
07-10-2020T13:12:05,CrimsonQuill,Umm... I wouldn't go that far.
07-10-2020T13:12:08,CrimsonQuill,We're not weird...
07-10-2020T13:12:13,CrimsonQuill,We're just monstrous.
07-10-2020T13:12:20,CrimsonQuill,We are a pox upon this earth.
07-10-2020T13:12:24,TerraTheWizard,ok but we can all agree that paws > feet
07-10-2020T13:12:29,AspiringNoodle,^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

07-10-2020T13:12:46,CrimsonQuill,Would the UNSC commission keidran Mjolnir armour?
07-10-2020T13:12:50,AspiringNoodle,Who WOULDN'T want that???

07-10-2020T13:12:54,CrimsonQuill,That's MY question.
07-10-2020T13:12:58,CrimsonQuill,Oh...Tail pillow..
07-10-2020T13:13:02,TerraTheWizard,even plantigrade style paws (with sensible toes)
07-10-2020T13:13:13,TerraTheWizard,"human feet are just, odd"
07-10-2020T13:13:23,CrimsonQuill,Very good for bipedalism.
07-10-2020T13:13:33,CrimsonQuill,And we have the best throwing arms in the animal kingdom.
07-10-2020T13:13:53,CrimsonQuill,"""Man, that girl's got a really good arm!"" *Cue Plasma Grenade Stick on Tex*#"
07-10-2020T13:14:41,CrimsonQuill,But we humans are not weird. We are worse.
07-10-2020T13:15:14,CrimsonQuill,We are an unholy terror upon this earth. A nightmare that THINKS and RELISHES in suffering inflicted.
07-10-2020T13:15:57,AspiringNoodle,"Okay, time for the real question"
07-10-2020T13:16:00,CrimsonQuill,"We waste, and then blame those who we kill with out waste. We fight wars over completely false circumstances, and call them 'holy' or 'patriotic' or 'righteous'"
07-10-2020T13:16:09,AspiringNoodle,"Gene splicing has done it, and furries are now a real thing"
07-10-2020T13:16:13,AspiringNoodle,What species do you choose
07-10-2020T13:16:16,CrimsonQuill,...
07-10-2020T13:16:19,CrimsonQuill,That is a tough one.
07-10-2020T13:16:29,TerraTheWizard,wolf
07-10-2020T13:16:33,AspiringNoodle,I want to say fox or snep
07-10-2020T13:16:36,CrimsonQuill,pauses cynical speech to ponder on species
07-10-2020T13:16:37,JojoGD,snow leopard
07-10-2020T13:16:44,AspiringNoodle,"But then vader-san makes a compelling case for some lizards, lol"

07-10-2020T13:21:03,TerraTheWizard,"for some reason the plural of Smurf is Smurfs, and not Smurves like it should be"
07-10-2020T13:21:22,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-keith8D:
07-10-2020T13:21:40,TerraTheWizard,have fun with this cursed useless info
07-10-2020T13:21:53,CrimsonQuill,Tolkein actually described that with Dwarves in the introduction to 'The Hobbit'.
07-10-2020T13:23:32,TerraTheWizard,hmm
07-10-2020T13:24:57,CrimsonQuill,"Just before the chat resumes a semblence of normality, should I continue my cynical and navel-gazing speech on the inherent horror of the human race upon mother Gaia, or should I let it fizzle and disappear?"
07-10-2020T13:26:40,CrimsonQuill,I will take the silence as a wish to return to normality.
07-10-2020T13:26:52,CrimsonQuill,shuts up and goes to watch SovietWomble
07-10-2020T13:28:21,CrRAR,It has to do with weight distribution a constanly sprung ankle is more agile but also more delicate.
07-10-2020T13:28:45,CrRAR,Like human knees are a horribly vulnerable design.
07-10-2020T13:29:06,CrRAR,...but sort of a sacrifice becomeing bipedal
07-10-2020T13:30:10,CrimsonQuill,Oh tell me about it...my knees feel awful after extended crouching at work
07-10-2020T13:31:00,CrRAR,"Yeah, like if humans tried walking tiptoes all the time the tendons and ligaments would prbably wear quicker like our are prone to do"

07-10-2020T14:12:08,AspiringNoodle,He was so funny he even made the camerman laugh
07-10-2020T14:12:38,AspiringNoodle,I wonder how many people noticed the camera shaking during that scene.
