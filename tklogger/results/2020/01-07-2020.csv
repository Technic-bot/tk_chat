01-07-2020T03:32:04,AspiringNoodle,Trimmed some of my hair back a smidge
01-07-2020T03:32:20,AspiringNoodle,Felt a bit awkwardly long compared to the rest ._.
01-07-2020T03:36:06,TeapotOfDoom,Good morning
01-07-2020T03:36:17,TeapotOfDoom,I see purp is still streaming
01-07-2020T03:36:20,AspiringNoodle,Nope
01-07-2020T03:36:25,AspiringNoodle,He arted so hard to brokeded the system
01-07-2020T03:36:31,SpazztasticKiwi,🛌
01-07-2020T03:36:37,TeapotOfDoom,Night spazz
01-07-2020T03:36:50,AspiringNoodle,And my brains for no engrish good at current
01-07-2020T03:36:56,TeapotOfDoom,Strem broke? Bec it doesn't load
01-07-2020T03:37:09,AspiringNoodle,He ended... 6 hours ago
01-07-2020T03:37:31,TeapotOfDoom,Oh why does it say he's live for over 12h now
01-07-2020T03:37:40,AspiringNoodle,Cuz Picarto
01-07-2020T03:37:45,TeapotOfDoom,Well
01-07-2020T03:38:23,AspiringNoodle,Nani the literal fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuug
01-07-2020T03:38:38,AspiringNoodle,"52,609 new covid cases in the US yesterday?!?"
01-07-2020T03:38:51,TeapotOfDoom,Welcome to a pandemic
01-07-2020T03:38:53,AspiringNoodle,...I wonder if those numbers are being inflated by antibody tests...
01-07-2020T03:39:05,TeapotOfDoom,Nope prolly not
01-07-2020T03:39:13,AspiringNoodle,"Just learned that there are two tests that can be run, active or antibody"
01-07-2020T03:39:30,TeapotOfDoom,Also europe is starting to shut down again
01-07-2020T03:39:35,TeapotOfDoom,Fun times
01-07-2020T03:39:39,AspiringNoodle,Active is the harder one to get and tests for the virus in your system.  The antibody exactly what it sounds like.  But if you have the antibodies then it counts as a case.
01-07-2020T03:40:22,TeapotOfDoom,Well i don't think so. Bec if you have em you'ro prolly already fine again
01-07-2020T03:40:32,TeapotOfDoom,Also i'ma be heading again
01-07-2020T03:40:36,TeapotOfDoom,Cya
01-07-2020T03:40:38,AspiringNoodle,Cya :D
01-07-2020T05:31:40,Poojawa,o/
01-07-2020T05:52:53,AspiringNoodle,Hello :)
01-07-2020T06:29:50,swedishkitsune,o/
01-07-2020T06:36:16,swedishkitsune,"derp, picarto still hasnt ended the note of purps stream"
01-07-2020T07:04:24,AspiringNoodle,"Yup, lol"
01-07-2020T07:04:38,AspiringNoodle,And there's one more game off my backlog <3
01-07-2020T07:11:35,Rainelover,"Oh boy, I HAVE ARRIVED... AGAIN"
01-07-2020T07:13:01,Rainelover,WHY IS PURPLE STILL STREAMING??!
01-07-2020T07:44:36,AspiringNoodle,"He's not, lol"
01-07-2020T07:44:40,AspiringNoodle,Picarto being Picarto :snail:
01-07-2020T08:04:35,Rainelover,Oh
01-07-2020T08:05:02,Rainelover,That is extremely slow
01-07-2020T08:09:47,AspiringNoodle,*sigh* I disappoint me :c
01-07-2020T08:10:02,AspiringNoodle,I feel like I may have ruined my Amnesia experience a bit
01-07-2020T08:12:01,AspiringNoodle,Used the wiki for some locations as well as an achievement guide.  Then I end up making one achievement unachievable just by figuring out a puzzle ahead of schedule
01-07-2020T12:18:41,Xexanoth,"well, that's why achievements are dumb"
01-07-2020T15:02:34,SpazztasticKiwi,picarto unbroke

01-07-2020T16:00:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m convinced a nonstop power mile will kill you
01-07-2020T16:10:00,AspiringNoodle,You mean like cardio?
01-07-2020T16:10:27,AspiringNoodle,"And yeah, Xexa, that's why I'm trying to move away from hunting down achievements"
01-07-2020T16:11:22,AspiringNoodle,Maybe that's why I like The Completionist.  His shtick is that he 100% games whenever possible.  But apparently some games drive him up the wall
01-07-2020T16:11:25,SpazztasticKiwi,1.5
01-07-2020T16:11:58,AspiringNoodle,So a power mile is 1.5 miles?
01-07-2020T16:12:28,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s walking with a set pace for a mile
01-07-2020T16:12:34,SpazztasticKiwi,no stopping
01-07-2020T16:13:06,AspiringNoodle,"Well that's not true then, lol"
01-07-2020T16:13:22,AspiringNoodle,People have completed a mile in under 4 minutes :D
01-07-2020T16:13:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I wasn’t going for a time
01-07-2020T16:14:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"I walked 1.4 mile, nonstop pace"
01-07-2020T16:14:20,SpazztasticKiwi,there’s nothing not true about that
01-07-2020T16:25:49,AspiringNoodle,Hmmmm... might try SOMA next...
01-07-2020T16:26:08,AspiringNoodle,Apparently that game gets suuuuuuuuper freaky and philosophical
01-07-2020T16:39:14,CrRAR,:coffee::ctwokinds-daydreamingkat:
01-07-2020T16:39:31,CrRAR,just brewed some coffe fresh
01-07-2020T16:39:37,CrRAR,:ccrrar-chipr:
01-07-2020T16:43:40,AspiringNoodle,I'm getting disk write errors trying to install SOMA :c
01-07-2020T16:44:57,CrRAR,Enough space hopefully?
01-07-2020T16:46:16,AspiringNoodle,First I'm checking to see if there's a problem with my system
01-07-2020T16:46:40,AspiringNoodle,"Just did a Windows update, now I'm scanning my disk to see if there's any storage issues or corruption of the system image"
01-07-2020T16:46:59,AspiringNoodle,And good on both fronts
01-07-2020T16:47:30,CrRAR,"Soma: Scary to play, scary to install"
01-07-2020T16:47:38,CrRAR,What an experience
01-07-2020T16:47:52,CrRAR,Breaks the 4th wall right out the gate
01-07-2020T16:48:47,CrRAR,"Nutmeg is a weird seasoning, I always have this expectation that it’s more delicious than it is."
01-07-2020T16:49:13,AspiringNoodle,Apparently it's a SOMA only thing :/
01-07-2020T16:49:22,CrRAR,"Maybe because it’s normally put on delicious things and I really miss theose things, not nutmeg."
01-07-2020T16:49:27,CrRAR,Oh is there a fix?
01-07-2020T16:49:43,CrRAR,Like Cinnamon Rolls :9
01-07-2020T16:49:55,CrRAR,Cinnamon Rolls have nutmeg
01-07-2020T16:50:09,CrRAR,and dat icing
01-07-2020T16:50:18,AspiringNoodle,"I mean, it's not like I'm blocked off completely from downloading it, but I have to keep hitting freakin' resume every other second"
01-07-2020T16:50:30,CrRAR,Augh
01-07-2020T16:51:11,AspiringNoodle,"For a 10GB game, I'm getting 1 - 30MB every time I hit ""resume"""
01-07-2020T16:51:23,CrRAR,Sounds like their hosting server is misbehaving?
01-07-2020T16:51:38,CrRAR,Rest of your internet is okay?
01-07-2020T16:53:16,AspiringNoodle,"Yeah, like I said, this is a SOMA only issue with steam forum posts"
01-07-2020T16:53:31,AspiringNoodle,"Good thing I have 10MB/s internet, or this would take forever..."
01-07-2020T16:53:55,CrRAR,Yeah the size of stuff is crazy these days
01-07-2020T16:54:06,CrRAR,dat high fidelity
01-07-2020T16:54:13,CrRAR,T e x t u r e s
01-07-2020T16:54:27,AspiringNoodle,Oh thank goodness
01-07-2020T16:54:35,AspiringNoodle,Looks like most of the problems were the initial files
01-07-2020T16:54:43,CrRAR,Oh good
01-07-2020T16:55:24,AspiringNoodle,"I'm still hitting resume, but at least I'm making real progress now before it stops again"
01-07-2020T16:56:29,AspiringNoodle,"So, after finishing the Amnesia games, pretty good~"
01-07-2020T16:56:46,CrRAR,I see they’re working on a new title too
01-07-2020T16:56:57,AspiringNoodle,My only critique of The Dark Descent is that sanity takes too long to recover
01-07-2020T16:57:04,CrRAR,lol
01-07-2020T16:57:11,CrRAR,TOO REAL
01-07-2020T16:57:21,AspiringNoodle,There are many events in the game that can knock a huge level off your sanity
01-07-2020T16:57:33,AspiringNoodle,"Some can be avoided, some can't"
01-07-2020T16:58:16,AspiringNoodle,"Unless you pay attention to everything on a few playthroughs and figure out how much they give / take, there's no real rhyme or reason"
01-07-2020T16:59:01,AspiringNoodle,And the amount of time it takes to recover most of your sanity is obscene.  We're talking standing in front of a candle for 5 - 10 minutes if you hit the lowest level
01-07-2020T16:59:49,AspiringNoodle,"Oh yeah, don't think you saw this, I locked myself out of an achievement earlier"
01-07-2020T17:00:01,CrRAR,Oh I saw lol
01-07-2020T17:00:09,AspiringNoodle,It's frustrating
01-07-2020T17:00:11,CrRAR,You jumped puzzle progess
01-07-2020T17:00:46,AspiringNoodle,"It's a good example of why if you're going to block off something later, you should make it clear that it's going to happen..."
01-07-2020T17:01:02,CrRAR,"I wonder if that was intentional by the developers or an oversight like, “Nahh, they’ll never figure that out till later anyway”"
01-07-2020T17:01:13,CrRAR,Yeah
01-07-2020T17:01:15,AspiringNoodle,So the Chancel has 2 versions
01-07-2020T17:02:00,AspiringNoodle,"The developers probably planned for players to run into the initial version, explore it fully, realize that there's no way to progress further, and then go back to the Nave and try to figure out how to lift the 2 gates blocking the other areas"
01-07-2020T17:02:25,AspiringNoodle,"But if you fully explore areas like I do, there are 2 levels on the upper level when you first enter the Nave"
01-07-2020T17:02:29,AspiringNoodle,2 levers*
01-07-2020T17:02:53,AspiringNoodle,"If you try to use them, they don't work.  You go downstairs, you can hear machinery running, and might notice a hatch in the roof near a table"
01-07-2020T17:03:06,AspiringNoodle,"You open the hatch, you see there are gears in there, but some are moving, some aren't"
01-07-2020T17:03:41,AspiringNoodle,"You can't reach it on the table alone, but if you grab a crate and put it on the table and then get on top of it, you can reach the gears and interact with them"
01-07-2020T17:04:03,CrRAR,Mess with ALL THE GEARS
01-07-2020T17:04:05,AspiringNoodle,"That moves the one gear back into position and when you go back upstairs, the levers work again, and hallelujah, you can access the previously gated off areas!"
01-07-2020T17:04:09,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-sleepoverA::ctwokinds-sleepoverB:
01-07-2020T17:04:20,CrRAR,:gear::gear::gear::gear:
01-07-2020T17:04:34,AspiringNoodle,"If you do the side areas first, you can't finish 2 of the achievements in the game :/"
01-07-2020T17:04:38,CrRAR,I see
01-07-2020T17:05:21,AspiringNoodle,"There are six pieces of an orb, 3 in each area, that you collect.  And if you collect all six and try to go to the Chancel, an event triggers where 3 enemies spawn and knock you out"
01-07-2020T17:05:25,CrRAR,"Yeah, sounds like an oversight, most achievements probably rely on doing certain things in a checkpointed-like order"
01-07-2020T17:05:49,AspiringNoodle,Amnesia truly is terrifying
01-07-2020T17:05:57,CrRAR,Like once you check off all the tasks as they expected *pop* achievement
01-07-2020T17:06:06,CrRAR,:fireworks::ccrrar-chickcr:
01-07-2020T17:06:20,AspiringNoodle,"If I want to get the achievement, I'd need to load the autosave before I did one of the side areas"
01-07-2020T17:06:47,AspiringNoodle,"Once that cutscene triggers, when you return to the Chancel, the area changes and one of the bridges to a side room is destroyed"
01-07-2020T17:07:07,AspiringNoodle,"There's a note and a tinderbox that are no longer reachable, both of which are for separate achievements"
01-07-2020T17:07:37,CrRAR,"I wonder if there’s forums with savedumps, so you could like load from a particular point to resume where you need to to get the achievement"
01-07-2020T17:07:50,CrRAR,I know some games let that happen
01-07-2020T17:08:02,CrRAR,Kinda like cheating though :\
01-07-2020T17:08:12,AspiringNoodle,I watched a walkthrough vid so I saw what the rooms look like and what the note reads
01-07-2020T17:08:19,CrRAR,Ah
01-07-2020T17:08:34,AspiringNoodle,Just kinda sad that the developers didn't think about that
01-07-2020T17:09:06,AspiringNoodle,"Like, even though it wouldn't make sense, have a lever in the Chancel that unlocks the trap door, even through it's so far away and would make no flipping sense"
01-07-2020T17:09:11,CrRAR,Yeah at worst they could have just allowed both orders to unlock it
01-07-2020T17:09:19,AspiringNoodle,"Or maybe, the door is blocked off and you need an item to unlock it"
01-07-2020T17:09:38,CrRAR,"Yeah, they probably just didn’t think about it"
01-07-2020T17:10:31,AspiringNoodle,"I honestly don't care about the achievement because I don't want to do the Choir Hall again, lol"
01-07-2020T17:10:31,CrRAR,I miss the golden days of gaming when devs EXPECTED people would break games and find glitches and would hide eastereggs and whatnot
01-07-2020T17:10:53,CrRAR,Lately they try and eliminate to make more “polished experiences”
01-07-2020T17:11:09,AspiringNoodle,"Tell that to the guy who broke Sekiro and finished it in under 30 minutes, lmao"
01-07-2020T17:11:21,CrRAR,Oh yeah speedruns lol
01-07-2020T17:11:26,CrRAR,Those are a trip
01-07-2020T17:11:29,AspiringNoodle,"Dude, it's insane"
01-07-2020T17:12:09,CrRAR,"I’ve seen some, like geometry glitches and whatever to warp"
01-07-2020T17:12:10,AspiringNoodle,"Anywho, a blind Amnesia playthrough?  Yeah... let's players back in the day weren't faking their reactions"
01-07-2020T17:12:23,AspiringNoodle,ESPECIALLY Markiplier
01-07-2020T17:12:40,AspiringNoodle,"I feel like he acts it up a bit these days whenever playing games, exagerrating his emotions"
01-07-2020T17:13:01,CrRAR,Gotta EMOTE
01-07-2020T17:13:03,AspiringNoodle,"But playing Amnesia, I believe his moments were genuine"
01-07-2020T17:13:09,CrRAR,lol
01-07-2020T17:13:20,AspiringNoodle,"In the Choir Hall, there's an Iron Maiden in one of the rooms"
01-07-2020T17:13:36,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-laura:*[my type of place]
01-07-2020T17:13:47,AspiringNoodle,"When you walk near it, the doors suddenly fling open, the screen distorts a bit, there's a scream, a small blood mist flys out, and I genuinely jumped in my seat"
01-07-2020T17:14:32,AspiringNoodle,"I watched a walkthrough for the area and used the wiki, and even then the zone was gdamn terrifying"
01-07-2020T17:15:14,AspiringNoodle,"In particular, the area is terrifying because it's dark (though thankfully not the sanity draining type everywhere else)"
01-07-2020T17:15:32,AspiringNoodle,"There's a bit of fog, the developers drew inspiration from Silent Hill, that makes it a bit harder to see"
01-07-2020T17:15:47,CrRAR,"Yeah, anything + dark is pretty freaky"
01-07-2020T17:15:51,AspiringNoodle,The area is VERY open.  Most zones are claustrophobic and / or have lots of rooms to hide in
01-07-2020T17:16:03,CrRAR,Open is just as bad
01-07-2020T17:16:09,AspiringNoodle,"There are some rooms, but for the most part you just have a bunch of pillars"
01-07-2020T17:16:10,CrRAR,Adds to the fear of the unknown
01-07-2020T17:16:22,CrRAR,Like when you’re swimming in deep water
01-07-2020T17:16:34,CrRAR,and don’t know what lurks~
01-07-2020T17:16:38,AspiringNoodle,"yeah, I refuse to go out into the ocean ever :upside_down:"

01-07-2020T17:19:06,CrRAR,:ptv-ohmy:
01-07-2020T17:19:54,AspiringNoodle,So those monsters I linked are the most dangerous in order from least to most
01-07-2020T17:20:34,AspiringNoodle,"Kaernk isn't that dangerous because it's only found in watery areas, you can tell where it is when it moves, and it can be distracted with meat"
01-07-2020T17:20:41,AspiringNoodle,"Also, you can ""kill"" them :P"
01-07-2020T17:20:43,CrRAR,Yeah I’ve seen the flappyface guy lol
01-07-2020T17:21:00,CrRAR,He’s like their signature monster dude
01-07-2020T17:21:03,AspiringNoodle,That's the grunt.  You can outrun them and they take a few hits to kill you
01-07-2020T17:21:17,CrRAR,I’ve never deen the nightmare dolphin though
01-07-2020T17:21:47,CrRAR,Yeah I kinda got the effect that he’s like always just kind of stalking you
01-07-2020T17:22:07,CrRAR,or at least shortly after you start exploring
01-07-2020T17:24:08,AspiringNoodle,Nightmare dolphin?  The brute?
01-07-2020T17:24:23,AspiringNoodle,"Oh, the kaernk"
01-07-2020T17:24:31,CrRAR,"No, yeah, the flappyface guy"
01-07-2020T17:24:37,CrRAR,the one WITH eyes
01-07-2020T17:24:42,CrRAR,xD
01-07-2020T17:24:59,AspiringNoodle,"Oooooo, the grunt!"
01-07-2020T17:25:07,CrRAR,Yeah him I guess
01-07-2020T17:25:09,AspiringNoodle,"Errr, gatherer"
01-07-2020T17:25:18,AspiringNoodle,"The signature monster, right?"
01-07-2020T17:25:21,CrRAR,Is he the most encountered or no?
01-07-2020T17:25:26,CrRAR,I think... so
01-07-2020T17:25:51,AspiringNoodle,The guy with the weird mouth and mostly normal head is the signature monster
01-07-2020T17:26:04,CrRAR,The one with no eyes reminds me a bit of uh... the Clickers from The Last of Us
01-07-2020T17:26:17,AspiringNoodle,"That's the Brute, the most dangerous enemy"
01-07-2020T17:26:41,AspiringNoodle,"The Gatherer's aren't the brightest, they fulfill the ""dumb guard"" role"
01-07-2020T17:26:49,CrRAR,I see
01-07-2020T17:27:03,AspiringNoodle,"They might investigate an area, but do it very half-assed and quickly"
01-07-2020T17:27:23,AspiringNoodle,In Hard Mode they apparently are closer to the Brute in thoroughness
01-07-2020T17:27:43,CrRAR,Ah
01-07-2020T17:27:45,AspiringNoodle,"Fun fact about the Kaernk, it's model is a ball"
01-07-2020T17:27:52,CrRAR,lol
01-07-2020T17:28:00,AspiringNoodle,"""ball of death"""
01-07-2020T17:28:25,AspiringNoodle,"But like I said, they can be distracted and / or ""killed"""
01-07-2020T17:28:40,CrRAR,"More thoroughness, sounds like the AI for a roomba"
01-07-2020T17:28:43,AspiringNoodle,"I think when you ""kill"" them, you're just forcing their model through the floor of the map and then the game doesn't really know what to do with them"
01-07-2020T17:29:17,AspiringNoodle,"But outside of knowing how to ""kill"" them, if there's any meat lying around in a room, you can toss it off into some corner and wait for the kaernk to start eating it"
01-07-2020T17:29:25,CrRAR,"Yeah they say that, lots of times the models aren’t discharged from RAM just stored somewherer else for it to pop up"
01-07-2020T17:29:28,AspiringNoodle,Then you can move unopposed
01-07-2020T17:29:52,AspiringNoodle,"The Brute is the most dangerous enemy in the game, though"
01-07-2020T17:30:22,CrRAR,Many chompy face-teeth
01-07-2020T17:30:25,AspiringNoodle,"They run faster than Daniel, can kill you in one hit, even at full health, and they *actually* investigate"
01-07-2020T17:30:54,AspiringNoodle,And the Choir Hall has up to 6 of them that will spawn
01-07-2020T17:31:54,AspiringNoodle,I legit almost gave myself a heart attack when doing that room
01-07-2020T17:32:20,AspiringNoodle,"Even following the walkthrough video, a servant grunt spawned that I wasn't expecting, I turn around and start retracing my steps, and then I come face to face with the dang thing"
01-07-2020T17:32:49,AspiringNoodle,Somehow the brute didn't spot me and I was able to slink away with my heart going nuts
01-07-2020T17:34:09,AspiringNoodle,"So yeah, I stand by my statement, Amnesia is terrifying"
01-07-2020T17:34:21,AspiringNoodle,"Even with the wiki and walkthroughs, I was able to get terrified"
01-07-2020T17:34:37,CrRAR,"Rightly so, yeah tough not to become immersed"
01-07-2020T17:34:40,AspiringNoodle,Makes me wonder if I'll be able to finish Alien: Isolation
01-07-2020T17:35:09,CrRAR,I believe in you!
01-07-2020T17:35:15,AspiringNoodle,To give you an idea of how much time I'd have to respend in Amnesia to get those achievements
01-07-2020T17:35:32,AspiringNoodle,"I finished the game, and it only took 9 hours"
01-07-2020T17:35:57,AspiringNoodle,I'd be spending maybe an extra hour at most to restart from just before completing the orb
01-07-2020T17:36:45,CrRAR,That’s decent playtime for a game like that
01-07-2020T17:37:11,CrRAR,Portal 1’s campagine was about that and that started as an indie-type effort
01-07-2020T17:37:15,AspiringNoodle,"Yup.  I looked at my time played and just went, ""Really???"""
01-07-2020T17:37:26,CrRAR,Probably felt longer lol
01-07-2020T17:37:27,AspiringNoodle,I finished this game over 2 weeks
01-07-2020T17:37:38,AspiringNoodle,"And it did not feel like 9 hours, lol"
01-07-2020T17:38:07,AspiringNoodle,SOMA gonna be hardmode mang
01-07-2020T17:38:23,AspiringNoodle,"In Amnesia, when a monster spawns, it's because it was scripted"
01-07-2020T17:38:36,AspiringNoodle,"It'll explore for a bit, but if it doesn't find anything it'll despawn"
01-07-2020T17:38:47,CrRAR,Uh huh
01-07-2020T17:39:04,AspiringNoodle,"A Machine for Pigs had a bit more permanence.  They patrolled a small area, but once you got past them, you were good"
01-07-2020T17:39:14,CrRAR,*pop*
01-07-2020T17:39:20,AspiringNoodle,"That said, holy eff were the Tesla Pigs terrifying :ptv-shock:"
01-07-2020T17:39:26,CrRAR,"“Oh, well, no one to terrorize*"
01-07-2020T17:39:32,CrRAR,*pop*
01-07-2020T17:39:56,AspiringNoodle,"From the looks of it, SOMA's monsters are permanent"
01-07-2020T17:40:09,AspiringNoodle,They're attached to certain areas and move about.  You just have to avoid them
01-07-2020T17:40:21,CrRAR,Mm
01-07-2020T17:41:25,CrRAR,Tesla pigs... anything like those electro critters in HL: Alyx I wonder?
01-07-2020T17:42:04,CrRAR,Oh no (just looked it up) much worse
01-07-2020T17:42:26,CrRAR,Looks more like a Big Daddy steampunk type abomination
01-07-2020T17:42:59,AspiringNoodle,There's only one level where you actually have to deal with them :D
01-07-2020T17:43:09,AspiringNoodle,But holy sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet
01-07-2020T17:43:22,AspiringNoodle,I somehow managed to ace those areas and take no damage
01-07-2020T17:44:05,CrRAR,:ok_hand:
01-07-2020T17:44:07,AspiringNoodle,"First pig:  Don't think it ever actually saw me.  I figured out that I needed to activate those two levers.  Did the first one, heard the pig coming over, bolted for the 2nd one, flipped it, pig disappeared"
01-07-2020T17:44:18,AspiringNoodle,Second:  Aced that area
01-07-2020T17:44:43,AspiringNoodle,"Third: I was just bolting from the second's area, made a wrong turn, came face to face, 180 noped out of there and bolted through that zone"
01-07-2020T17:45:08,AspiringNoodle,But never took damage
01-07-2020T17:46:28,CrRAR,Very dark
01-07-2020T17:46:32,CrRAR,Much running
01-07-2020T17:46:36,CrRAR,"Wow, lol"
01-07-2020T17:47:27,CrRAR,Player guy at the point of the vid I skipped to: “runningrunningrunning running runningrunning”
01-07-2020T17:47:33,CrRAR,xD
01-07-2020T17:47:38,AspiringNoodle,"Yeah, the pig's terrifying because it's invisible half the time, but I guess it can still hear you"
01-07-2020T17:47:55,AspiringNoodle,"Bruh, you *gotta* watch the first encounter with the room with the pylons and the levers"
01-07-2020T17:48:18,AspiringNoodle,"When I did that room, I was terrified, only ever saw glimpses of the pig, because I mostly ever only saw blue lightning"
01-07-2020T17:48:28,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-rose:*[that’s a neat ability]
01-07-2020T17:48:30,AspiringNoodle,"And when I did see the model on occassion, it was behind a pillar"
01-07-2020T17:48:55,CrRAR,Was it obvious it was behind the pillar
01-07-2020T17:48:58,CrRAR,*?
01-07-2020T17:51:09,AspiringNoodle,Only when it made itself visible :D
01-07-2020T17:51:23,CrRAR,"lol, what a silly goober."
01-07-2020T17:52:29,AspiringNoodle,Huh... might have fixed the SOMA issue
01-07-2020T17:52:36,AspiringNoodle,Just needed to repair the steam library folder?
01-07-2020T17:52:49,CrRAR,Excellente
01-07-2020T17:52:50,AspiringNoodle,"Ofc, we'll see how my download goes once it gets around the 4GB mark"
01-07-2020T17:52:55,AspiringNoodle,Had to start the download over >_>
01-07-2020T17:53:36,CrRAR,"Oh well, there’s more internet where that came from"
01-07-2020T17:54:39,AspiringNoodle,So much nicer~
01-07-2020T17:54:47,AspiringNoodle,Almost at 1.4
01-07-2020T17:54:50,CrRAR,Oh good
01-07-2020T17:56:41,AspiringNoodle,Got my first error after 1.4GB
01-07-2020T17:56:43,AspiringNoodle,I'll take it!
01-07-2020T18:02:58,Xexanoth,"...whatever you're doing, you're doing it wrong XD"
01-07-2020T18:04:15,AspiringNoodle,"Is not me, is this dang game"
01-07-2020T18:04:36,AspiringNoodle,"Out of curiousity, I tried following other repair steps, and now I have to start over again, but I'm getting these errors everywhere again"
01-07-2020T18:06:57,AspiringNoodle,"Once the game is fully installed, I'll just make sure all the files are intact"
01-07-2020T18:08:32,AspiringNoodle,So... SOMA promises to be terrifying beyond belief :D
01-07-2020T18:08:50,Xexanoth,"i mean, the installation already is terryfing apparently"
01-07-2020T18:08:56,AspiringNoodle,"Yeah, lol"
01-07-2020T18:08:57,CrRAR,xD
01-07-2020T18:08:58,AspiringNoodle,This game gone meta
01-07-2020T18:09:04,CrRAR,That’s what I said
01-07-2020T18:09:08,AspiringNoodle,^
01-07-2020T18:09:23,AspiringNoodle,It'll be bad enough that the monsters are more permanent
01-07-2020T18:09:35,AspiringNoodle,But apparently they all have different trigger behaviors
01-07-2020T18:10:13,AspiringNoodle,Some will be triggered by sounds
01-07-2020T18:10:19,AspiringNoodle,Some by sight
01-07-2020T18:10:26,AspiringNoodle,Some by proximity / observation
01-07-2020T18:10:55,AspiringNoodle,"If you encounter a blind enemy, you'll need to keep in mind that turning your flashlight on or off makes sound :upside_down:"
01-07-2020T18:14:37,CrRAR,"Those must be Kat’s summer stockings for that outfit, light n breezy ankles."

01-07-2020T18:17:38,AspiringNoodle,I wonder if Eric would make any new lady Keidran he wants to paint wear that outfit
01-07-2020T18:18:10,CrRAR,Kat would probably burn it before that ever happened

01-07-2020T18:51:37,AspiringNoodle,"Gonna jinx it, SOMA nearing completion"
01-07-2020T18:51:44,AspiringNoodle,I think it's actually gone like 2GB now without puasing
01-07-2020T18:54:41,AspiringNoodle,"Lol, hit a pause 300MB later"
01-07-2020T18:55:58,Xexanoth,pretty sure the game doesn't want to be played
01-07-2020T18:58:23,AspiringNoodle,"Lol, if that's the case, then I can always download the wuss mod :P"
01-07-2020T18:59:12,AspiringNoodle,"Because this game needs to be explored for all the little tidbits and lore like Amnesia and the like, but the monsters never despawn, it can be a bit oppressive to try and find everything when you're always at risk"
01-07-2020T18:59:32,AspiringNoodle,So someone made a mod that removes the ability of monsters to attack you :P
01-07-2020T18:59:52,AspiringNoodle,But I'll probably play through the game legit once before I consider it
01-07-2020T19:05:47,SpazztasticKiwi,I missed all of strem
01-07-2020T19:07:49,SpazztasticKiwi,went in earlier because I got there before schedule
