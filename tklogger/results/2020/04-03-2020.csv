04-03-2020T00:28:02,JojoF2415,I finally got a picture of my wolf drawing you wanted to see noodle
04-03-2020T00:28:44,JojoF2415,I think you have forgotten now but it was around January
04-03-2020T00:31:15,AspiringNoodle,"Oh, the one for art class?"
04-03-2020T00:31:28,JojoF2415,Yup

04-03-2020T00:32:02,AspiringNoodle,"Also, I was talking with the hospitality manager at a competing convenience store"
04-03-2020T00:32:20,AspiringNoodle,He said he knew the company I worked for looked bad from the perspective of an outside looking in
04-03-2020T00:32:29,AspiringNoodle,But the shite I told him was icing on the cake!
04-03-2020T00:32:39,AspiringNoodle,And the benefits of working at his store sound amazing ;_;
04-03-2020T00:33:49,AspiringNoodle,Nothing will EVER beat the story of me pulling sunflower seeds that should've been pulled in December of 2017...
04-03-2020T00:33:52,AspiringNoodle,In October of 2019...
04-03-2020T00:37:13,JojoF2415,I still have my bump on my collar bone

04-03-2020T00:38:58,SonOfGoku,What was it on?
04-03-2020T00:39:06,JojoF2415,Math
04-03-2020T00:39:15,SonOfGoku,Fun stuff
04-03-2020T00:39:17,JojoF2415,Angles transitions
04-03-2020T00:39:39,JojoF2415,Inter grated math 1 is boring
04-03-2020T00:39:59,SonOfGoku,I’m glad I won’t have to take another math class for the rest of this school year
04-03-2020T00:40:06,JojoF2415,I might skip 2 if it isn’t challenging
04-03-2020T00:41:51,JojoF2415,I just want this grading period to end
04-03-2020T00:41:53,SonOfGoku,What engineering project were you talking about earlier today?
04-03-2020T00:42:14,JojoF2415,I had to make edits on a assignment
04-03-2020T00:42:34,JojoF2415,It’s stuff I do on inventor
04-03-2020T00:42:56,SonOfGoku,That’s always a fun program to use
04-03-2020T00:43:04,JojoF2415,I want to take full IB classes
04-03-2020T00:43:40,SonOfGoku,Too bad I probably won’t get to use it since my job will probably only use revit and autocad
04-03-2020T00:44:37,JojoF2415,There is mostly females on the engineering class
04-03-2020T00:44:52,JojoF2415,Half of them disrupt the class every day
04-03-2020T00:45:12,SonOfGoku,What is the class called?
04-03-2020T00:45:22,JojoF2415,Intro to design
04-03-2020T00:45:38,JojoF2415,I may take it again if acid gets boring

04-03-2020T00:46:54,SonOfGoku,I wish I took some art classes in high school
04-03-2020T00:47:09,JojoF2415,I’m mostly self taught
04-03-2020T00:47:35,JojoF2415,I didn’t learn almost anything new on that art class
04-03-2020T00:48:32,JojoF2415,The graphic novel unit isn’t even fun for me. I feel forced to draw it
04-03-2020T00:49:20,JojoF2415,I’m going to sleep now

04-03-2020T17:01:39,TerraTheWizard,instead of the weird flora & neutral page with the wings

04-03-2020T19:05:29,Dadrobit,Just finished the second part of my Interstellar Astronomy midterm. Feeling okay about it.
04-03-2020T19:05:43,Dadrobit,"First part came back, got a 90% on it."
04-03-2020T19:06:18,Dadrobit,Professor showed the class a score distrobution graph of everyone's scores across his classes.
04-03-2020T19:06:32,Dadrobit,Over half of everyone straight up failed the midterm.
04-03-2020T19:06:54,Dadrobit,Turns out I was one of only 2 people that even got a 90%.
04-03-2020T19:07:19,Dadrobit,Straight up fucking shocking distobution of scores.
04-03-2020T19:08:44,Dadrobit,"Granted, I know that I failed today's portion of the midterm, so I can't feel all that proud of myself. But still. I think I'll rock a solid C by the end of it."
04-03-2020T19:13:02,tehbear,so youre a solid lightyear ahead of half the class
04-03-2020T19:19:43,Dadrobit,Maybe even a whole parsec
04-03-2020T19:42:11,JojoF2415,I hope I finish off with good grades this grading period
04-03-2020T19:44:21,JojoF2415,I’m half way through finishing this biology comic
