08-09-2020T17:00:41,SpazztasticKiwi,I was considering bronze but I don‚Äôt want a bronze that‚Äôs too dark
08-09-2020T17:23:00,CrRAR,Is the bathroom have dark cabinets or stuff in it?
08-09-2020T17:23:24,CrRAR,Brushed nickle color is pretty popular
08-09-2020T17:24:07,CrRAR,Rustoleoum makes some nice metallic lookind spray paints
08-09-2020T17:24:28,CrRAR,Like a metally frosted look
08-09-2020T17:25:55,CrRAR,"Also, nice wall accessories make a noticable difference, like towel rack, face cloth holder thing, robe/towel hook and the toilet paper thing."
08-09-2020T17:27:06,CrRAR,These ones: https://www.rustoleum.com/product-catalog/consumer-brands/universal/universal-metallic-spray-paint
08-09-2020T17:31:39,SpazztasticKiwi,there‚Äôs a color called ‚Äúsea glass‚Äù
08-09-2020T17:31:45,SpazztasticKiwi,sea glass is a color now
08-09-2020T17:32:12,SpazztasticKiwi,most of my shelving is black so I may just stay to that
08-09-2020T17:32:31,CrRAR,They have a metallic black
08-09-2020T17:32:33,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs just these two are rusty and mismatched colors
08-09-2020T17:33:01,CrRAR,"Wait, I guess that‚Äôs a deep blue"
08-09-2020T17:33:13,SpazztasticKiwi,"Ferdy‚Äôs cage stand is black, my bookshelf is black, the one bathroom shelf is black"
08-09-2020T17:33:26,CrRAR,They might have a fancy black in the ‚Äúhammererd‚Äù finish
08-09-2020T17:33:34,CrRAR,That might look neat
08-09-2020T17:33:53,SpazztasticKiwi,I have a dark green shelf & white stand that are the only odd balls unless you count my wood dresser
08-09-2020T17:34:00,CrRAR,Kinda like a dappled look
08-09-2020T17:34:13,CrRAR,ah

08-09-2020T17:36:13,SpazztasticKiwi,paint be looking rough
08-09-2020T17:36:48,CrRAR,Interior design is fun coordinating colors and shopping and transforming everything
08-09-2020T17:37:26,SpazztasticKiwi,you‚Äôre an adult when you‚Äôre excited to look at paint samples and reorganize a room
08-09-2020T17:38:21,CrRAR,Finding stuff to hang on walls and arrangement is neat
08-09-2020T17:39:16,CrRAR,There‚Äôs a certain visual satisfaction when things are balanced and arranged just right

08-09-2020T22:46:42,AspiringNoodle,End up working an extra hour longer solo because the other guy left at 8 instead of 9.  In peak summer traffic.  Thanks scheduling...
