23-09-2020T08:08:37,Dadrobit,The tailor just point blank asks you to what side you tuck everything on and they can seamlessly (pun intended) tailor your pants so everything fits pleasantly without overtly showing while still being tailored exactly to your body.
23-09-2020T08:09:29,Dadrobit,Kidrobit was shocked the first time he got something properly made.

23-09-2020T21:01:47,K3IDRAN,[not a rp action]
23-09-2020T21:02:50,AspiringNoodle,I would say Far Cry is fiction
23-09-2020T21:03:06,AspiringNoodle,"But considering how 2020 is going, Far Cry might be a few years from being reality :ptv-laugh:"
23-09-2020T21:03:56,K3IDRAN,I'm a noob at editing

23-09-2020T21:32:53,SpazztasticKiwi,& ‚ÄúI can handle it‚Äù is not the argument
23-09-2020T21:33:02,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs age gated because of the content
23-09-2020T21:33:13,SpazztasticKiwi,which is not a ‚Äú‚Äùmaturity‚Äù‚Äù problem
23-09-2020T21:33:36,K3IDRAN,Yeaha maturity problem...
23-09-2020T21:41:17,SpazztasticKiwi,this is why I don‚Äôt have kids
23-09-2020T21:41:19,AspiringNoodle,Part of me wonders...
23-09-2020T21:41:26,AspiringNoodle,"lol, that timing xD"
23-09-2020T21:41:43,AspiringNoodle,"But what's the point of the ""mature"" tag for streams that are NSFW if the site is age gated?"
23-09-2020T21:42:05,AspiringNoodle,"Is it meant to be more of a, ""Don't tune in to this stream if at work"" or something like that?"
23-09-2020T21:46:52,SpazztasticKiwi,it could be that some adults would also like a warning to mature content if they don‚Äôt like it
23-09-2020T21:47:08,SpazztasticKiwi,those exist
23-09-2020T21:47:23,AspiringNoodle,fair point
23-09-2020T22:04:24,SpazztasticKiwi,so what makes the perfect nightstand
23-09-2020T22:05:13,K3IDRAN,I actually agree with uou on not having kids

23-09-2020T22:26:20,AspiringNoodle,"That's the official patent date, so he's credited with the creation, but the exact idea for the tools probably existed for a long time before that."
23-09-2020T22:27:44,AspiringNoodle,"Officially, I'm agnostic, but if I think supernatural shit is happening in my home, you bet your sweet ass I'm contacting my closest Roman Catholic church."
23-09-2020T22:28:00,K3IDRAN,I hope Eliijah is proud
23-09-2020T22:28:07,AspiringNoodle,The power of Christ compels you- to get the F*CK OUT OF MY HOUSE

23-09-2020T22:39:26,K3IDRAN,K
23-09-2020T22:48:10,AspiringNoodle,done :)
23-09-2020T22:48:53,AspiringNoodle,Now to make sure that all my BIOS settings are intact
23-09-2020T22:50:26,AspiringNoodle,"Nope, brb, lol"
23-09-2020T22:50:27,K3IDRAN,Gewd jawb
23-09-2020T22:53:25,AspiringNoodle,"Well, I shoulda known that updating my bios would've wiped teh settings"
23-09-2020T22:55:10,K3IDRAN,Damn
23-09-2020T22:58:21,AspiringNoodle,"Alright, that should be the last time I disappear, just needed to close Firefox and make sure my CPU was hitting the right speeds"
23-09-2020T23:04:17,K3IDRAN,CPU is like a nuclear reactor sometimes
23-09-2020T23:04:48,K3IDRAN,1 wrong move and then all hell breaks loose
23-09-2020T23:06:19,K3IDRAN,I'm looking at you Chernobyl
23-09-2020T23:08:51,AspiringNoodle,"At some point in the future, if I get my backlog on my computer under control, I'm gonna look into doing a custom OC for my processor"
23-09-2020T23:09:10,K3IDRAN,Nice
23-09-2020T23:09:16,AspiringNoodle,Somebody is actually developing a tool that will do most of the heavy lifting for overclocking new ryzen processors
23-09-2020T23:10:06,AspiringNoodle,"Depending on your luck, it might be able to overclock AND undervolt the processor."
23-09-2020T23:12:04,AspiringNoodle,"Alright, time to plug this in"
23-09-2020T23:24:33,AspiringNoodle,Part of the reason I updated my bios is that my USB drive was acting a bit weird
23-09-2020T23:25:01,AspiringNoodle,"Moved it from the slots designated for BIOS stuff, but the BIOS was still able to pull the BIOS file from it's current slot, and the drive was hitching sometimes"
23-09-2020T23:25:41,AspiringNoodle,So I've moved it as far away from those 2 slots as I can while still using USB 3.0.  Time will tell if this solves the problem.
23-09-2020T23:25:58,AspiringNoodle,"And while I was at it, plugged in my new USB-Micro usb cable in the back :D"
