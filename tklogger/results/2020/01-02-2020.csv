01-02-2020T00:00:20,AspiringNoodle,5: Will you remain below your corruption limit if you put on the new gear?
01-02-2020T00:01:24,AspiringNoodle,"The more corruption you have, the worse downsides you experience"
01-02-2020T00:01:31,AspiringNoodle,0 corruption or less: Nothing
01-02-2020T00:02:23,CrRAR,"Well, I guess it gives some prestige to those dedicated enough to understand the mechanics of the system."
01-02-2020T00:02:28,AspiringNoodle,"1 - 19: When you take damage, you have a chance to be slowed for 5 seconds.  The slow's magnitude increases with corruption"
01-02-2020T00:02:41,CrRAR,lol
01-02-2020T00:03:41,AspiringNoodle,20 - 39 corruption: Your spells and abilities have a chance to summon an Eye of Corruption for 8 seconds.  It will inflict increasing damage every 2 seconds you are within range.  Range and damage increases with corruption.
01-02-2020T00:04:38,AspiringNoodle,40 - 59:  Taking damage has a chance to summon a Thing from Beyond to pursue you for 8 seconds.  Speed increases with corruption.
01-02-2020T00:06:05,AspiringNoodle,"60 - 79: If you are struck by a Thing from Beyond, you are immediately afflicted by Grasping Tendrils (tier 1) and Eye of Corruption (tier 2).  And this thing will nuke your health even without this tier..."
01-02-2020T00:07:26,AspiringNoodle,"80+: You gain the Inevitable Doom debuff, increasing damage taken and reducing healing received."
01-02-2020T00:07:49,AspiringNoodle,"At 80, it starts at 5%, and goes up 1% for every additional point of corruption."
01-02-2020T00:07:53,AspiringNoodle,See the problem with this system?
01-02-2020T00:08:43,CrRAR,"Yeah, some of it is no-want"
01-02-2020T00:09:41,CrRAR,What a mixed bag of effects.
01-02-2020T00:09:53,CrRAR,"lol, also Trace's estate is pretty seriously corrupted then it has both a seeing eye of corruption and some wayward tendrils."
01-02-2020T00:10:01,AspiringNoodle,"It's more or less (stay at tier 1 or lower, or we boot your ass from the raid)"
01-02-2020T00:10:44,CrRAR,haha
01-02-2020T00:10:47,AspiringNoodle,"It's not uncommon for raid bosses to have mechanics that require your ass to move out of an attack, stay within a very limited range, or not move very much"
01-02-2020T00:11:09,AspiringNoodle,"Yeah, you can do more damage if you have more corruption buffs, but if you die, know how much damage you do? ZERO."
01-02-2020T00:12:06,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-RainezZz: night fellas
01-02-2020T00:12:12,CrRAR,noight
01-02-2020T00:12:17,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-awoo:
01-02-2020T00:12:23,AspiringNoodle,"Additionally, these effects will put more strain on the healers to keep corrupted players alive, which could also result in failed attempts"
01-02-2020T00:12:57,AspiringNoodle,"It's like... noobs aren't gonna understand how bad they're screwing themselves over, and hardcore people are going to burn out trying to maximize the new system"
01-02-2020T00:13:21,AspiringNoodle,I don't see this going past 8.3.
01-02-2020T00:13:26,CrRAR,wow
01-02-2020T00:13:39,CrRAR,way to throw a wrench in things
01-02-2020T00:14:16,AspiringNoodle,"Also, I don't like the visual effects of corruption"
01-02-2020T00:14:20,AspiringNoodle,SO I refuse to go above 0 :P
01-02-2020T00:14:36,CrRAR,yes stay pure :ctwokinds-daydreamingkat:
01-02-2020T00:15:00,AspiringNoodle,"Also, you can't NOT use corrupted items"
01-02-2020T00:15:17,AspiringNoodle,This patch introduced a new legendary cloak (huge reference to MoP) that gives corruption resistance
01-02-2020T00:15:41,AspiringNoodle,"And there are new azerite traits that give it as well.  As it stands, I'm at 30 corruption resistance, so I lose out by NOT using at least 1 corrupted item."
01-02-2020T00:16:04,AspiringNoodle,So it's just an extra headache all-around
01-02-2020T00:37:16,AspiringNoodle,"RAR, if you think the Twokinds fandom is thirsty, you have not met Vulpera, lmao"
01-02-2020T00:37:33,henner,lol i somehow knew there would be WoW players that follow twokinds
01-02-2020T00:38:01,AspiringNoodle,"Duh, beastraces are a huge part of fantasy ;D"
01-02-2020T00:38:07,AspiringNoodle,I like playing the tiny fox people and bears
01-02-2020T00:38:15,AspiringNoodle,Also tauren :ptv-uneasy:

01-02-2020T00:38:47,AspiringNoodle,"If you play a male worgen, look out"
01-02-2020T00:38:51,AspiringNoodle,"My shaman is thirsty af, lmao"
01-02-2020T00:38:54,henner,female
01-02-2020T00:38:57,henner,but like
01-02-2020T00:39:12,henner,"really big, muscular, and crazy eyed"
01-02-2020T00:39:32,henner,also she totes around a double barrel machine gun with huge axe blades on it

01-02-2020T00:39:59,AspiringNoodle,My favorite Vulperan flirt <3
01-02-2020T00:40:08,henner,oh
01-02-2020T00:40:58,henner,yea my character aint really sexual like that
01-02-2020T00:41:22,henner,shes really messed up in the head after some stuff happened involving worgen and horde and all that
01-02-2020T00:41:54,AspiringNoodle,"At this point, i just listened to all the female vulperan flirts and rolled with the joke, ""welp, my characters gonna be thirsty af from now on"""
01-02-2020T00:42:06,henner,lol
01-02-2020T00:44:06,henner,"im not a rper, but i like character design and backstories"

01-02-2020T00:45:42,AspiringNoodle,"""Come a little closer. I'll tell you what the fox says."""
01-02-2020T00:46:05,henner,"ive seen videos and stuff, ive also seen it in game, but apparently a type of rper is the one with the edgy dark sad story where the character goes through mental trauma and their whole family is gruesomely killed"
01-02-2020T00:46:12,henner,heh
01-02-2020T00:46:33,henner,my story is like that but with an interesting twist
01-02-2020T00:47:04,AspiringNoodle,I had an idea for a D&D character.  A rogue/assassin who doesn't like killing when not necessary
01-02-2020T00:47:35,AspiringNoodle,The idea is that they grew up under a foreign military occupation and poisoned the entire enemy force when things started going too far
01-02-2020T00:48:07,AspiringNoodle,Suffice to say... to ensure that they were ALL poisoned and died (so as they couldn't call for reinforcements) meant their deaths weren't pretty.
01-02-2020T00:48:07,JojoF2415,I finished the sketch part of my drawing
01-02-2020T00:48:55,henner,wat drawing?
01-02-2020T00:49:14,AspiringNoodle,"The scary part?  There are real poisons that can take upwards of 3 - 4 days to show symptoms AND can kill you, regardless of aid."
01-02-2020T00:49:51,henner,hmm
01-02-2020T00:51:11,AspiringNoodle,"Favorite mechagnome (male) joke: ""Why yes, I do have a vibrate setting! Why does everyone keep asking?"""
01-02-2020T00:51:26,henner,i like mechagnomes

01-02-2020T00:53:25,henner,lol wut
01-02-2020T00:53:30,AspiringNoodle,"Trust me, the VA did a great job on this one"
01-02-2020T00:53:35,AspiringNoodle,It sounds so devious and I love it
01-02-2020T00:53:46,henner,ay jojo what u drawing?
01-02-2020T00:54:01,AspiringNoodle,Last one and personal favorite
01-02-2020T00:54:06,AspiringNoodle,"""I want you to know I cherish your friendship. But if you die on me, I'm taking your stuff."""
01-02-2020T00:54:06,henner,so u still playing?
01-02-2020T00:54:16,henner,lol
01-02-2020T00:54:29,AspiringNoodle,"Yup, gonna do some daily stuff in a bit"
01-02-2020T00:54:34,AspiringNoodle,I'm an ele shaman :D *zap zap*
01-02-2020T00:54:46,henner,i cancelled my sub last year i think?
01-02-2020T00:55:02,AspiringNoodle,"If you thought Legion had too much to do, oof"
01-02-2020T00:55:07,henner,like 2 or 3 months after they released that sweet worgen update
01-02-2020T00:55:20,henner,when i cancelled*
01-02-2020T00:56:21,AspiringNoodle,Legion had that island from the initial assault and Argus
01-02-2020T00:56:28,henner,"kinda shame, i like the characters and the story and the customization and classes and all, its just the old repetitive gameplay and not bieng immersed into it"
01-02-2020T00:56:46,AspiringNoodle,"Tbh, the problem is that the game got too damn grindy / slow to play"
01-02-2020T00:56:57,AspiringNoodle,Legion was pretty fast by comparison.
01-02-2020T00:57:05,AspiringNoodle,BFA go slower AND grindier
01-02-2020T00:57:14,henner,i always found myself looking at the action bar rather than what was actually going on so it was really just unimmersive for me
01-02-2020T00:57:20,henner,so i bought overwatch
01-02-2020T00:57:52,AspiringNoodle,I'm hoping Shadowlands finally reels things in
01-02-2020T00:58:08,henner,it wont
01-02-2020T00:58:12,AspiringNoodle,It's better that people have too little to do than too much
01-02-2020T00:59:11,henner,i wonder what twokinds artstyle would look like if he drew world of warcraft stuff
01-02-2020T00:59:11,AspiringNoodle,Shadowlands is already gonna head in a better direction
01-02-2020T00:59:30,AspiringNoodle,Blizzard finally admitted that they fucked up and went too far with things like RNG on gear and trimming spellbooks
01-02-2020T00:59:39,henner,legion was good
01-02-2020T00:59:53,henner,people were so pumped before bfa hit
01-02-2020T01:00:04,AspiringNoodle,My only complaint is Legion had too much grind available :P
01-02-2020T01:00:21,henner,they thought it was gonna bring back old style wow
01-02-2020T01:00:28,AspiringNoodle,"Or, more accurately, unending grind.  And RNG was starting to go too far, but the game was so fun people (including me) didn't care"
01-02-2020T01:00:44,henner,hmm
01-02-2020T01:01:08,AspiringNoodle,"BFA was a downgrade from Legion in almost every way.  So I'm not sure if the negative parts of Legion got worse, or if they become more prominent as a result"
01-02-2020T01:01:26,SpazztasticKiwi,night Tom
01-02-2020T01:01:27,AspiringNoodle,But the result was basically goblin engineering
01-02-2020T01:01:41,henner,"or wait nvm on what i sdaid about twokinds wow art, i allready know what it would look like :p"
01-02-2020T01:01:49,henner,tom hasnt even been online
01-02-2020T01:01:53,henner,since last week
01-02-2020T01:01:57,AspiringNoodle,I want to see him draw a Vulpera :ptv-excited:
01-02-2020T01:02:10,AspiringNoodle,also he was on Kame's stream last night :ptv-snicker:
01-02-2020T01:02:36,henner,yea i am pretty influenced by the twokinds style art
01-02-2020T01:02:48,henner,so i drew my wow character recently
01-02-2020T01:03:17,AspiringNoodle,I'm probably gonna use Tom as a base to start
01-02-2020T01:03:25,AspiringNoodle,But I have a LOT of artists I like
01-02-2020T01:03:34,henner,"yes there is more detailed shading and highlights and all, but essential lighting, the background, and the overall lineart shows through as toms style alot"
01-02-2020T01:03:59,AspiringNoodle,"Not sure if I'll stay in a simpler 2d style like Tom has, or go more full rendering"
01-02-2020T01:04:13,henner,im kinda in between
01-02-2020T01:04:31,henner,lol rn im putting a base color on my 4runner art and it looks sick
01-02-2020T01:04:45,henner,again with heavy influenced twokinds lineart
01-02-2020T01:04:51,henner,lol about that
01-02-2020T01:05:03,AspiringNoodle,"Also, have you seen Viktria's comics?"
01-02-2020T01:05:08,AspiringNoodle,I love her style so much :ptv-hearts:
01-02-2020T01:06:35,henner,"iv allways had a wierd idea where somehow someone accadentally went through a temporary portal while driving on a dirt road in a 4runner, and was stuck in the twokinds world, people would be shocked to see some strange futuristic fast moving carrage thing"
01-02-2020T01:06:38,henner,and no
01-02-2020T01:06:41,henner,i havent
01-02-2020T01:06:56,AspiringNoodle,I'm conflicted about promoting her here.  Welcome to New Dawn was amazing.  And it was completely PG :D
01-02-2020T01:07:06,AspiringNoodle,She also does porn comics
01-02-2020T01:07:22,AspiringNoodle,But they are the most wholesome l00ds you will ever see (and maybe feel :ptv-snicker:)
01-02-2020T01:07:33,henner,hmm

01-02-2020T16:56:05,ThingsAreMoving,All of that fire could easily be transformed to water. Just slide the hue bar accordingly.
01-02-2020T16:56:22,Roughlandin,"""The Calm Before the Storm""... Well, that's not ominous."
01-02-2020T16:56:35,Bigboi182,"@Roughlandin honestly, go for it."

01-02-2020T16:57:01,ThingsAreMoving,I wonder if Tom will go all R. R. Martin on some of the cast.
01-02-2020T16:57:19,ShamusTheFox,"Oooh, background flare."
01-02-2020T16:57:24,Roughlandin,If Tom kills my fur children I will riot

01-02-2020T17:28:51,RileyTheRiolu,"Anyways, I'll try not to talk too much about this, but what would Tom think of stories inspired by TwoKinds?"
01-02-2020T17:28:53,CrRAR,;)
01-02-2020T17:28:54,AspiringNoodle,Only if you take off your shirt as well

01-02-2020T17:30:20,Roughlandin,@RileyTheRiolu You might want to PM Tom about that first. Nobody else can say and it probably depends on WHAT you intend to write.
01-02-2020T17:30:52,RileyTheRiolu,Yeah... I wonder if Tom can see this?
01-02-2020T17:30:56,Roughlandin,Oh he can
01-02-2020T17:30:59,CrRAR,He see

01-02-2020T17:31:51,CrRAR,*fffweeee*
01-02-2020T17:31:56,Roughlandin,Dude can we get this as one of those sick 80s felt blacklight posters?
01-02-2020T17:32:00,HoverdudeXL,Ohhhhhh looks nice
01-02-2020T17:33:16,CrimsonHelsing,ooh this is looking gorgeous
01-02-2020T17:33:23,RileyTheRiolu,Oh yeah...
01-02-2020T17:33:30,ShamusTheFox,I like how she makes the appearance of the flames around her body seem effortless.
01-02-2020T17:33:36,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,this is looking so gorrgeous
01-02-2020T17:33:49,steelabjur,"Riley, people have done fan fiction based on TK plenty, even linked to it on the forums, some of it quite....blue. I think if he had a problem with it he would've said something by now."
01-02-2020T17:34:05,RileyTheRiolu,yeah
01-02-2020T17:34:08,Roughlandin,"@RileyTheRiolu I mean there's a lot of unsanctioned TK art and writing out there, but I'd at least give him a rundown of the plot content first. It IS his IP. Respect and all that"
01-02-2020T17:34:29,Roughlandin,Speaking of respect. Dang Tom. Mad skillz
01-02-2020T17:34:34,CrRAR,"Laura, ultimate sacrifice maker, baptised and reborn in fire~"
01-02-2020T17:34:49,AspiringNoodle,You KNOW people love a work when they want to write / draw fanfiction
01-02-2020T17:34:55,AspiringNoodle,But they want the artist's approval first.
01-02-2020T17:35:07,RileyTheRiolu,"ok, maybe I should rephrase what I meant... I made the story before I knew TwoKinds existed. It's not in the TwoKinds universe, it's an entirely different one"
01-02-2020T17:35:30,Roughlandin,But it includes TK characters?
01-02-2020T17:35:32,RileyTheRiolu,no
01-02-2020T17:35:55,KeefMcDerpface,So what's the connection to thje TK universe?
01-02-2020T17:35:59,KeefMcDerpface,*the
01-02-2020T17:36:32,Roughlandin,I mean there's other fantasy stuff with anthro characters
01-02-2020T17:36:37,steelabjur,What I'm trying to figure out...
01-02-2020T17:36:43,RileyTheRiolu,"Yeah, I think I didn't phrase it correctly. Sorry for confusing you guys"
01-02-2020T17:36:49,Roughlandin,It's no problem
01-02-2020T17:37:06,RileyTheRiolu,"So anyways, I could tell you about the world I'm making. But I have it in a doc, and I can't explain here without sending a wall of text"
01-02-2020T17:37:15,Roughlandin,Every story is inspired by something
01-02-2020T17:37:26,KeefMcDerpface,Then why ask for approval if it doesn't include TK property.
01-02-2020T17:37:37,RileyTheRiolu,"Ok, here is what i meant.."
01-02-2020T17:37:49,Roughlandin,As long as the characters aren't like a blue haired guy named Race and a Tigress named Flaro
01-02-2020T17:38:19,RileyTheRiolu,"I was thinking of making a side story, where it involves the TK characters. They play a role, but it's mostly my characters."
01-02-2020T17:38:22,RileyTheRiolu,Emphasis on side story
01-02-2020T17:38:35,Roughlandin,That's what I was trying to get at
01-02-2020T17:38:36,KeefMcDerpface,So background characters?
01-02-2020T17:38:47,KeefMcDerpface,Easter eggs?
01-02-2020T17:38:51,Roughlandin,So they just like cameo
01-02-2020T17:38:52,ShamusTheFox,"Tom, you're giving me feels again."
01-02-2020T17:39:05,steelabjur,So it would be in the TK universe.
01-02-2020T17:39:28,RileyTheRiolu,nvm... I think I confused you guys enough
01-02-2020T17:39:36,Roughlandin,No dude it's cool
01-02-2020T17:39:36,KeefMcDerpface,You sure did.

01-02-2020T18:03:23,Rolley,@swiftkitten the nibbly animation is set in time with the average tempo so you have a 4 10ths of a second window for it to be in time with any music
01-02-2020T18:03:35,AspiringNoodle,"Pineapples, stupidly big, may or may not genderbend and / or racebend you :P"

01-02-2020T18:04:49,RileyTheRiolu,"Quick question, what drawing software does Tom use?"
01-02-2020T18:04:53,AspiringNoodle,PS
01-02-2020T18:05:05,KeefMcDerpface,^Photoshop
01-02-2020T18:05:08,RileyTheRiolu,Photoshop? Wow... he must be pretty good at it
01-02-2020T18:05:15,RileyTheRiolu,"I use Krita, which I find to be more my style"
01-02-2020T18:05:17,AspiringNoodle,"He's been using it forever, lol"
01-02-2020T18:05:24,Avolendi,"With how these two worked out, kinda makes one wonder how many of those sketches etc outside of the story were canon :)"
01-02-2020T18:05:31,KeefMcDerpface,He's a master of the arts.
01-02-2020T18:05:34,SpazztasticKiwi,his drawing is actually a drug induced hallucination from a gas he pumps out your speakers when the stream plays
01-02-2020T18:05:37,AspiringNoodle,And I'm still salty that you're forced to sub to use PS -3-
01-02-2020T18:05:45,RileyTheRiolu,rip
01-02-2020T18:06:37,KeefMcDerpface,"Wait, so the Flora is just flatbread."
01-02-2020T18:06:39,AspiringNoodle,"I still say, at least at the consumer level, if you sub to Photoshop for 2 years or more, you should be allowed to keep access to the last version you had during the sub."
01-02-2020T18:06:47,AspiringNoodle,Yes.  Yes it is.
01-02-2020T18:06:49,Katfeathers,"for those not able to afford PS, Krita is a good recomendation"
01-02-2020T18:06:52,AspiringNoodle,*is mauled* Worth it.
01-02-2020T18:06:57,RileyTheRiolu,"yeah, Krita is pretty good"
01-02-2020T18:07:04,AspiringNoodle,I got CSP on sale
01-02-2020T18:07:16,AspiringNoodle,Gonna try to imitate Photoshop's brushes
01-02-2020T18:07:38,Avolendi,"To my knowledge, its not about the program you use, but the skills you develop. Being familiar with a program is good though"
01-02-2020T18:07:45,RileyTheRiolu,yeah
01-02-2020T18:07:53,Katfeathers,truth
01-02-2020T18:08:20,RileyTheRiolu,"I'm not bashing myself, but I think my art is just... average. it's not terrible, but it's not something like Tom's art. However, that's where I try more and improve."
01-02-2020T18:08:22,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,You speak the Tru Tru
01-02-2020T18:09:03,AspiringNoodle,Consider it effective marketing
01-02-2020T18:09:10,Avolendi,"Sounds familiar. Got moderate skills, though going to try and get that to at some a better level the coming month. Made some time for it ^^"
01-02-2020T18:09:12,AspiringNoodle,"Even knowing the many downsides of Adobe stuff, I still want it"
01-02-2020T18:09:20,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,keep on working Riley you will get better
01-02-2020T18:09:25,InTheLionsDen,After the first drawing I imagined a tiny flaming Laura on the center candle.
01-02-2020T18:09:25,RileyTheRiolu,Yeah
01-02-2020T18:09:26,SwiftKitten,why does this music make me uncomfertable
01-02-2020T18:09:42,RileyTheRiolu,"Trust me, in 2 years we go from the things in my scraps, to the thing I made now"
01-02-2020T18:09:47,RileyTheRiolu,"Which, is a very big difference"
01-02-2020T18:09:55,RileyTheRiolu,"can't really show examples though, can I?"
01-02-2020T18:10:00,SwiftKitten,oh now its better
01-02-2020T18:10:07,SwiftKitten,that was werid
01-02-2020T18:10:16,Avolendi,You have dA or so? I can look it up by name

01-02-2020T18:10:49,RileyTheRiolu,not sure if that's advertising
01-02-2020T18:11:25,Avolendi,Don't think so? At least I asked for it
01-02-2020T18:11:36,RileyTheRiolu,"ah, ok"

01-02-2020T18:14:04,RileyTheRiolu,The goal for my 3D modeling work is to make a character of mine that I can possibly anime

01-02-2020T18:14:18,Avolendi,Nice one Kat
01-02-2020T18:14:26,RileyTheRiolu,"Yeah, I could make a game around my story. Though, the plans I have is kinda big"
01-02-2020T18:14:43,KeefMcDerpface,Then make it an RPG?
01-02-2020T18:14:46,Zakuru,Thats good! Don't be discouraged by how ambitious your dreams are
01-02-2020T18:15:04,CrRAR,Gotta dream big to achieve big
01-02-2020T18:15:21,RileyTheRiolu,"Ok, before I get into the game itself, I gotta finish what I started. It does involve a link, or something."
01-02-2020T18:15:39,KeefMcDerpface,true
01-02-2020T18:16:17,Avolendi,I got it the other way around. Got a silly oversized project which could fit a story xD
01-02-2020T18:16:34,RileyTheRiolu,"So, basically... It's a world I made that I made before I knew about TwoKinds that involves Anthropomorphic animals"
01-02-2020T18:17:36,RileyTheRiolu,"The Anthropomorphic Animals are more Human like in nature, so they wear clothes, use human stuff, etc. That might sound a bit low, but once you get into the history and culture, I think it works"
01-02-2020T18:17:48,AspiringNoodle,Nothing to be ashamed of
01-02-2020T18:17:51,Rolley,Nice suit
01-02-2020T18:17:57,AspiringNoodle,"It's your standard ""best race"" :ptv-hearts:"
01-02-2020T18:17:59,Avolendi,It suits him
01-02-2020T18:18:00,AspiringNoodle,beast race*
01-02-2020T18:18:07,KeefMcDerpface,Nothing wrong for me.
01-02-2020T18:18:15,Rolley,lol
01-02-2020T18:18:19,CrRAR,"Beast race, best race?"
01-02-2020T18:18:27,AspiringNoodle,'tis true
01-02-2020T18:18:39,RileyTheRiolu,you're talking about the drawing?
01-02-2020T18:18:46,AspiringNoodle,Your world
01-02-2020T18:18:46,KeefMcDerpface,But the best race is the beast race.
01-02-2020T18:18:56,RileyTheRiolu,ah
01-02-2020T18:19:02,AspiringNoodle,Anthro animals are more or less defined as beast races in fantasy
01-02-2020T18:19:16,AspiringNoodle,Pretty standard stuff :D
01-02-2020T18:19:28,RileyTheRiolu,I guess you're right. It's a beast race that almost feels human.
01-02-2020T18:19:32,AspiringNoodle,"You got Worgens, Vulpera, Tauren, Pandaren, etc. in WoW."
01-02-2020T18:19:49,AspiringNoodle,Guild Wars 2 has the Charr
01-02-2020T18:19:49,KeefMcDerpface,"So wait, what type of time period are we talking about?"
01-02-2020T18:20:07,RileyTheRiolu,"The time period of ""Oden"" (the world of this race) isn't medieval actually"
01-02-2020T18:20:22,RileyTheRiolu,"it takes place in the 1950s, which I have plans to go to the 60s and 70s"
01-02-2020T18:20:44,KeefMcDerpface,"Wait, the race is Oden or the world is Oden?"
01-02-2020T18:20:51,RileyTheRiolu,The world is Oden
01-02-2020T18:20:58,KeefMcDerpface,ah
01-02-2020T18:21:07,RileyTheRiolu,The race is the Adri (unless you guys can think of another name)
01-02-2020T18:21:29,KeefMcDerpface,Simple enough to pronounce.
01-02-2020T18:21:37,RileyTheRiolu,I'll share a link to describe everything about Oden and the Adri race
01-02-2020T18:21:42,KeefMcDerpface,So it's good by my standards.
01-02-2020T18:21:42,RileyTheRiolu,"It's a google doc, if that's ok"

01-02-2020T18:27:26,RileyTheRiolu,"I do have nations, or regions"

01-02-2020T18:27:41,RileyTheRiolu,^
01-02-2020T18:27:50,RileyTheRiolu,I'll be glad to explain.
01-02-2020T18:28:31,KeefMcDerpface,Do they a least go to space by 1969?
01-02-2020T18:28:38,Rolley,I’m always like “there doesn’t need to be shading” but then after the shading is added I can’t live without it
01-02-2020T18:28:46,KeefMcDerpface,^
01-02-2020T18:29:08,RileyTheRiolu,"I am thinking about that, but if it does happen, then i think during their 1969, they go to a different place in my universe."
01-02-2020T18:29:12,RileyTheRiolu,or it could be space
01-02-2020T18:30:18,Avolendi,"Shading defines so much volume. Really like seeing how, like now, it defines the shape of the cloth details, or bits of fluff getting thickness"
01-02-2020T18:30:32,RileyTheRiolu,"Anyways... I'll start with Adristan. Based on it's name; it's based around the Middle Eastern and South Asian regions. So it's like places like Turkey, Pakistan, Iran, Iraq, and Afghanistan."
01-02-2020T18:30:46,RileyTheRiolu,"Adristan is where it really started, tbh. I added more places as it goes along"
01-02-2020T18:31:01,KeefMcDerpface,"I'm going to take a wild guess and say that you have nations that are traditional, and others that push the boundaries of what is possible."
01-02-2020T18:31:24,RileyTheRiolu,"I guess, if you count the African/Egyptian area having ""Shadow Games"""

01-02-2020T22:10:01,steelabjur,Bye Mvilu
01-02-2020T22:10:10,JojoF2415,I felt humiliated in my exam 2 years ago
01-02-2020T22:10:23,KeefMcDerpface,I know that feeling.
01-02-2020T22:11:00,JojoF2415,The doctor touched my private

01-02-2020T22:11:30,JojoF2415,I have that again in Tuesday
01-02-2020T22:11:34,DarthRexKing,I am guessing this doctor was not a real doctor?
01-02-2020T22:11:43,DarthRexKing,"Oh, just not used to that kind of procedure?"
01-02-2020T22:11:56,KeefMcDerpface,Someone is going to be Glory Killed.
01-02-2020T22:13:26,steelabjur,"For you it was a humiliating exam that you keep mentally going back to, for the Doctor, it was the fourth time he did that exam just that day."
01-02-2020T22:13:35,ProsePro7,Chiefs won
01-02-2020T22:13:49,AspiringNoodle,"I had a physical last year, doctor touched my junk"
01-02-2020T22:13:57,AspiringNoodle,"I was totally like, ""Meh, whatever"" ;)"

01-02-2020T22:15:09,KeefMcDerpface,I know that feeling Spazz.
01-02-2020T22:15:12,SpazztasticKiwi,...for me to miss over half strem
01-02-2020T22:15:13,JojoF2415,It was very humiliating. Also it happened to my older brother too
01-02-2020T22:15:34,JojoF2415,Today I finally was able to see parts of the stream
01-02-2020T22:15:37,KeefMcDerpface,"Stream crashed for me a few months back and when I got on, the stream ended."
01-02-2020T22:16:06,SpazztasticKiwi,how’d it go Tom? good progress?
01-02-2020T22:16:07,KeefMcDerpface,:ptv-shock: :ptv-shock: :ptv-shock:
01-02-2020T22:16:13,steelabjur,When did it drop for you Spazz?
01-02-2020T22:16:15,JojoF2415,I use the picarto app but it decided today not to load until now
01-02-2020T22:16:54,AspiringNoodle,"Sorry, guess I'm just being a jerk today"
01-02-2020T22:17:06,AspiringNoodle,"Also, sympathies for people whose streams didn't load"
01-02-2020T22:17:44,JojoF2415,I had to use google I. The end. I really don’t like using picarto on my phone
01-02-2020T22:18:03,JojoF2415,In google
01-02-2020T22:18:21,KeefMcDerpface,Never used it on my phone and I still won't use it.
01-02-2020T22:19:07,steelabjur,It was a great stream. Look forward to Grand Templar Laura getting posted.
01-02-2020T22:19:20,JojoF2415,I only use phone. Super rare when I use the computer but that’s only for homework
01-02-2020T22:19:43,KeefMcDerpface,"You should use the computer, runs more smoothly."
01-02-2020T22:19:56,KeefMcDerpface,Unless computer is shit/
01-02-2020T22:20:09,JojoF2415,The computer is only for homework
01-02-2020T22:20:29,KeefMcDerpface,Still a suggestion.
01-02-2020T22:20:37,JojoF2415,I’m good with a phone
01-02-2020T22:21:15,steelabjur,"I'm usually on the computer for work, so it's natural for me to use that. Rarely have problems with the website for streaming."
01-02-2020T22:21:31,KeefMcDerpface,^
01-02-2020T22:21:38,KeefMcDerpface,Same
01-02-2020T22:22:01,JojoF2415,The app sometimes acts up on me and the streams don’t load
01-02-2020T22:22:24,KeefMcDerpface,"Yeah, so far, the app sucks @$$."
01-02-2020T22:22:37,JojoF2415,I know
01-02-2020T22:23:11,DarthRexKing,"I am sure the doctor is just doing his job. I had a physical one time ago and thought nothing of it, but I understand you feel differently."
01-02-2020T22:23:24,DarthRexKing,Also I do not use picarto on my phone too much. >____.
01-02-2020T22:23:25,JojoF2415,Computer is better but i hardly ever use it
01-02-2020T22:23:27,DarthRexKing,>_>
01-02-2020T22:23:58,JojoF2415,My sister uses my computer most of the time
01-02-2020T22:24:02,KeefMcDerpface,oh
01-02-2020T22:24:18,KeefMcDerpface,Hmm
01-02-2020T22:24:36,KeefMcDerpface,How does Picarto work on a tablet?
01-02-2020T22:25:01,KeefMcDerpface,Good/Bad/Okay?
01-02-2020T22:25:13,JojoF2415,I don’t have a tablet
01-02-2020T22:25:33,KeefMcDerpface,Well that's out of the question then.
01-02-2020T22:26:01,JojoF2415,I kind of suck at digital art
01-02-2020T22:26:40,KeefMcDerpface,I suck at all kinds of art outside of pottery so I know how you feel.
01-02-2020T22:26:55,JojoF2415,I take too long and I kind of don’t like it
01-02-2020T22:27:06,KeefMcDerpface,"Yep, same here."
01-02-2020T22:27:10,JojoF2415,I am way better in traditional
01-02-2020T22:27:30,KeefMcDerpface,End up getting frustrated and give up.
01-02-2020T22:27:48,steelabjur,I have an old secondhand LG Tablet I use for playing videos while I do housework.
01-02-2020T22:27:55,JojoF2415,The longest drawing I’ve worked on was 16 hours
01-02-2020T22:28:03,KeefMcDerpface,Holy ...
01-02-2020T22:28:16,KeefMcDerpface,What was it?
01-02-2020T22:28:19,JojoF2415,It looks crappy
01-02-2020T22:28:26,KeefMcDerpface,oh
01-02-2020T22:28:51,JojoF2415,Pokémon black 2 and white 2 player vs iris
01-02-2020T22:29:20,KeefMcDerpface,"Yeah, I can see how that can take a while."
01-02-2020T22:29:32,JojoF2415,I can improve since it is close to 2 years since I drew it
01-02-2020T22:30:07,KeefMcDerpface,But will it take 16 hours?
01-02-2020T22:30:14,JojoF2415,So far I have only been drawing my oc’s
01-02-2020T22:30:26,JojoF2415,Probably less
01-02-2020T22:31:25,JojoF2415,People are surprised how good I draw for my age
01-02-2020T22:32:11,KeefMcDerpface,"""Years of practice my friend. Years of practice."""
01-02-2020T22:33:06,JojoF2415,I started to draw a lot when I was 11
01-02-2020T22:41:06,KeefMcDerpface,"Wait, Jojo, 16 hours straight or 16 total hours spread across a few days?"
01-02-2020T22:52:36,AspiringNoodle,"...time to cut back time spent in WoW, lol"
01-02-2020T22:53:02,AspiringNoodle,"You must question something when you waste time doing it, but it actively frustrates you"
01-02-2020T22:53:31,AspiringNoodle,ESPECIALLY when that something is a video game that really doesn't provide useful skills.  Unless you're super good and could go pro :P
01-02-2020T22:54:00,Rolley,How long did I miss the TK stream by
01-02-2020T22:54:06,JojoF2415,Spread out. The most I’ve done straight is 7 hours
01-02-2020T22:54:20,KeefMcDerpface,An hour I think Rolley.
01-02-2020T22:54:26,Rolley,Oh wow
01-02-2020T22:54:45,AspiringNoodle,Sunday streams start at 4PM ET
01-02-2020T22:55:05,Rolley,I know I saw the begging but had to leave
01-02-2020T22:55:23,AspiringNoodle,Would it help if I said they can run anywhere between 4 - 7 hours?
01-02-2020T22:55:39,Rolley,Yes it would
01-02-2020T22:55:44,Rolley,Thanks
01-02-2020T22:56:55,JojoF2415,I was play gd once for someone. I died in a level and then my chest didn’t feel right
01-02-2020T23:00:03,KeefMcDerpface,"Rolley, when you join a stream it should tell you how long it's been going on the bottom left. Do some math, and you should be able to calculate when the streams start for your area/timezone."
01-02-2020T23:01:46,KeefMcDerpface,That's what I did the first few times I joined.
01-02-2020T23:02:16,JojoF2415,Same
01-02-2020T23:02:39,KeefMcDerpface,see
01-02-2020T23:02:39,JojoF2415,TK streams start at 1 pm for me Sunday

01-02-2020T23:05:59,JojoF2415,"I started to read Twokinds in August 11, 2019 at 1:35 am"
01-02-2020T23:06:09,JojoF2415,on not in
01-02-2020T23:06:58,KeefMcDerpface,Started in 2018 for me.
01-02-2020T23:07:46,JojoF2415,"I joined the stream on October 18, 2019 at 6:22 pm"
01-02-2020T23:07:59,JojoF2415,Waiting 14 days was a pain in the butt
01-02-2020T23:08:23,KeefMcDerpface,yup
01-02-2020T23:08:42,JojoF2415,I started last year a weeaboo and this year semi furry idk
01-02-2020T23:09:17,KeefMcDerpface,No rule stating you have to be furry to enjoy the comic/stream.
01-02-2020T23:09:38,JojoF2415,I like the anthro art style
01-02-2020T23:09:53,KeefMcDerpface,"The art style is cute, which I like."
01-02-2020T23:10:07,JojoF2415,I realized that when I was in 4th grade I made a furry story without realizing it
01-02-2020T23:10:15,KeefMcDerpface,lol
01-02-2020T23:10:27,JojoF2415,I called it super cat
01-02-2020T23:11:11,JojoF2415,I’m careful at school not to show any furry drawings
01-02-2020T23:11:19,KeefMcDerpface,"Super Cat, Super Cat, does whatever a Super Cat does."
01-02-2020T23:11:57,JojoF2415,People say FURRY or make fun of you
01-02-2020T23:12:13,KeefMcDerpface,yup
01-02-2020T23:12:16,JojoF2415,My friends r ok with it.
01-02-2020T23:13:24,JojoF2415,A person I knew was surprised when I said anime sucks because I use to be a weeb
01-02-2020T23:13:50,KeefMcDerpface,Current anime or old school anime?
01-02-2020T23:14:15,JojoF2415,Current
01-02-2020T23:14:29,KeefMcDerpface,Same.
01-02-2020T23:14:49,KeefMcDerpface,I really love the art style of the Old School.
01-02-2020T23:15:03,JojoF2415,"The only anime I like is dragon ball, naruto, sao, re zero, and death note"
01-02-2020T23:15:19,JojoF2415,Demon slayer is so overrated and that’s a fact
01-02-2020T23:15:30,KeefMcDerpface,Mostly likely because I grew up with that art style.
01-02-2020T23:15:44,JojoF2415,I grew up with dragon ball z
01-02-2020T23:15:59,JojoF2415,My favorite anime of all time
01-02-2020T23:16:15,KeefMcDerpface,"Hec, there's a PS1 game from Japan with that art style and I love it."
01-02-2020T23:16:23,KeefMcDerpface,If only I can play it.
01-02-2020T23:16:28,JojoF2415,Drawing db is a pain because of the eyes
01-02-2020T23:17:14,KeefMcDerpface,Is it because of the art style. (I forgot the name of it.)
01-02-2020T23:17:25,JojoF2415,My first Twokinds drawings was a half old art style flora and new style flora
01-02-2020T23:18:37,JojoF2415,My second drawing was flora next to a realism drawing of a blacksmith from YouTube
01-02-2020T23:20:39,KeefMcDerpface,Note to self: Don't touch the upper right hand corner of a touch screen PC
01-02-2020T23:20:59,JojoF2415,I used to draw a lot but my dad seems to not like it
01-02-2020T23:26:20,JojoF2415,So far this year I only have 2 drawing done
01-02-2020T23:26:47,JojoF2415,A kathrine fan art and my oc sketch I’ll soon ink and color
01-02-2020T23:27:04,KeefMcDerpface,Two done in one month? Good.
01-02-2020T23:28:30,JojoF2415,I want to avoid using marker but I can’t
01-02-2020T23:28:50,KeefMcDerpface,"Oh no, the horror."
01-02-2020T23:29:15,JojoF2415,My profile pic is my kat fan art done with marker
01-02-2020T23:29:39,JojoF2415,It was simple
01-02-2020T23:30:24,KeefMcDerpface,"Even though the pfp are small, it does look nice."
01-02-2020T23:31:06,JojoF2415,Thanks
01-02-2020T23:31:33,KeefMcDerpface,Very close to Tom's art style from 2010 and such.
01-02-2020T23:31:56,KeefMcDerpface,"Wait, 2010? Nope sorry, chapter 10."
01-02-2020T23:32:02,JojoF2415,I tried going after toms art style
01-02-2020T23:32:17,KeefMcDerpface,I keep think chapter 10 came out in 2010.

01-02-2020T23:35:12,KeefMcDerpface,nice
01-02-2020T23:35:30,AspiringNoodle,"But right now, I'm realizing how many achievements in WoW are pointless and / or super time consuming"
01-02-2020T23:36:07,JojoF2415,World of Warcraft?
01-02-2020T23:36:10,Ordithus,that's how they get ya
01-02-2020T23:37:18,Ordithus,"I'm glad I played it, but also glad I only did for a few months"
01-02-2020T23:37:42,AspiringNoodle,There's some achievements I don't mind working towards
01-02-2020T23:38:42,AspiringNoodle,"But I'm looking at some, and I just don't have the time / work schedule to support it"
01-02-2020T23:38:55,JojoF2415,Only games I play is geometry Minecraft or Pokémon
01-02-2020T23:39:03,JojoF2415,Geometry dash
01-02-2020T23:39:11,AspiringNoodle,"Raiding is more or less on hiatus because part time 2nd shift only work doesn't exactly support it, lol"
01-02-2020T23:39:47,JojoF2415,Only 25 orbs and 1 diamond in that chest
01-02-2020T23:40:06,AspiringNoodle,"I mean, I COULD potentially make it work, but I'd need to find 11 - 2 raiders :/"
01-02-2020T23:41:03,Ordithus,You could play with people from a different time zone
01-02-2020T23:41:38,JojoF2415,When I finally beated Old Astral Divinity easy after 7 MONTHS. My sister thought I was going to get a heart attack from my reaction
01-02-2020T23:42:04,RimaDraws,oh my
01-02-2020T23:42:27,JojoF2415,My last achievement from 2019

01-02-2020T23:43:00,KeefMcDerpface,Same feeling here when I beat a boss on one hit only.
01-02-2020T23:43:23,AspiringNoodle,That would cost money
01-02-2020T23:43:33,JojoF2415,My heart rate was probably above 170 when I beat it
01-02-2020T23:43:45,AspiringNoodle,"Also, since I'm EDT / EST, I don't exactly have the option of finding people who raid later than me"
01-02-2020T23:43:56,AspiringNoodle,"errr, earlier"
01-02-2020T23:44:40,JojoF2415,My body was shaking once I beated a level called decent with 3 coins
01-02-2020T23:44:48,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m a building games person
01-02-2020T23:45:16,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ll spend more time making a sims world than playing it

01-02-2020T23:45:55,AspiringNoodle,Example of stupidly grindy WoW achievements: Supplying the Assassins - Loot 25 War Supply Chests in Nazjatar while an Assassin.
01-02-2020T23:46:43,KeefMcDerpface,Holy shit.
01-02-2020T23:46:45,Ordithus,"Most people I talk to about that game, it seems more work than fun"
01-02-2020T23:46:48,AspiringNoodle,Several problems with actively trying to get that achievement.
01-02-2020T23:46:49,Ordithus,Most give up
01-02-2020T23:46:59,AspiringNoodle,Burnout is a recent phenomenon in WoW
01-02-2020T23:47:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I make build organize and then I’m like “now what”
01-02-2020T23:47:21,AspiringNoodle,"People slowly stopped playing over the expansions, which makes sense, quality slowly dropped over time in many regards"
01-02-2020T23:47:26,AspiringNoodle,Also Blizzard being asses
01-02-2020T23:47:33,Ordithus,"You rain disasters upon your beautiful city, kiwi"
01-02-2020T23:47:46,Ordithus,Riots!  Earthquakes!  Alien invasions!
01-02-2020T23:47:47,SpazztasticKiwi,but my little peoples
01-02-2020T23:47:57,SpazztasticKiwi,i mades them

01-02-2020T23:48:04,JojoF2415,bloodbath by riot
01-02-2020T23:48:35,JojoF2415,A joke only geometry dash players would understand
01-02-2020T23:48:45,AspiringNoodle,"But in Legion / BFA, the grind has gotten ridiculous, and hardcore players have stopped playing"
01-02-2020T23:48:48,Ordithus,My favorite aliens replaced buildings with trees
01-02-2020T23:48:58,JojoF2415,Teacher: the test won’t be difficult
01-02-2020T23:48:59,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-daydreamingkat: so pretty
01-02-2020T23:49:02,SpazztasticKiwi,"I did have a game where a lady sim I made liked this male from the neighborhood so I let her flirt, helped her gather a relationship and then when I invited him and a handful of friends over"
01-02-2020T23:49:08,JojoF2415,The test: Zodiac
01-02-2020T23:49:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"after if asked him to move in, of course"
01-02-2020T23:49:34,AspiringNoodle,"So, here's why that achievement I mentioned is ridiculous :P"
01-02-2020T23:49:44,AspiringNoodle,Those war chests happen randomly
01-02-2020T23:49:58,SpazztasticKiwi,"for the wedding, I found out one of the invitees was the guys wife"
01-02-2020T23:49:58,AspiringNoodle,"You'll hear loud engine noises, which signals a plane flying into a zone to drop off a crate"
01-02-2020T23:50:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I never knew he was taken
01-02-2020T23:50:07,AspiringNoodle,...WHAT
01-02-2020T23:50:12,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-karenOOO: now that is akward
01-02-2020T23:50:39,KeefMcDerpface,"""Uhh."""
01-02-2020T23:50:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I had them go start the wedding but of course that triggered the cheating thing that happens when a sim is caught by their partner
01-02-2020T23:50:58,KeefMcDerpface,Doesn't it tell if a person is taken?
01-02-2020T23:51:12,SpazztasticKiwi,it was harder in the old sims
01-02-2020T23:51:17,KeefMcDerpface,Oh
01-02-2020T23:51:18,Ordithus,"The first wedding was so fun, let's have another!"
01-02-2020T23:51:43,SpazztasticKiwi,"I didn’t look at his relationships to see his wife, who would’ve been the top relationship there had I looked"
01-02-2020T23:51:44,KeefMcDerpface,Glad they made that change.
01-02-2020T23:52:24,SpazztasticKiwi,they had rings on their fingers but you had to zooooom in on the left hand to see if you saw it glint
01-02-2020T23:52:25,AspiringNoodle,"Before I forget to finish, that crate that drops from the plane slowly descends, and players from both factions will rush to claim it"
01-02-2020T23:53:13,KeefMcDerpface,Kiwi: Oh. Noodle: That sucks.
01-02-2020T23:53:17,AspiringNoodle,"Once a character from either side opens it, it is claimed for the one faction, and it disappears quickly"
01-02-2020T23:53:33,SpazztasticKiwi,admittedly I messed with my sims a bit
01-02-2020T23:53:35,AspiringNoodle,"That's not what makes the achievement difficult, however"
01-02-2020T23:53:37,Ordithus,"Sims 1: I had a guy complain about being tired when I told him to go to bed.  He fell asleep, next to the bed."
01-02-2020T23:53:45,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-keifacepalm:
01-02-2020T23:53:49,AspiringNoodle,"It's a combination of needing to do it 25 times, and the specifics behind being an Assassin."
01-02-2020T23:53:55,KeefMcDerpface,I hate when that happens.
01-02-2020T23:54:10,Ordithus,Lo and behold he was grumpy in the morning
01-02-2020T23:54:13,SpazztasticKiwi,"most games I had, I’d legit make a plot called the graveyard, kill sims on purpose, and move their graves there if not kill them on the plot"
01-02-2020T23:54:23,SpazztasticKiwi,simply because I wanted ghosts
01-02-2020T23:54:32,KeefMcDerpface,They need to use the restroom; pisses themselves outside the bathroom.
01-02-2020T23:54:53,AspiringNoodle,"To become an Assassin in WoW (War Mode, aka forced PvP that can only be turned off in rest areas) you must kill 10 enemy players without dying"
01-02-2020T23:55:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I had a sim once that was hungry but the moron want to do ~anything else~ but cook like I told him to
01-02-2020T23:55:09,AspiringNoodle,"You then get the Assassin buff, increasing damage and healing by 15%"
01-02-2020T23:55:23,KeefMcDerpface,IDIOT
01-02-2020T23:55:24,Ordithus,That seems really hard without killing low level players...
01-02-2020T23:55:33,AspiringNoodle,"BUT you also get a bounty placed on you, and a handy dandy marker on the zone map saying to the Alliance ""COME KILL THIS GUY FOR BONUSES"""
01-02-2020T23:55:54,KeefMcDerpface,Now that's bs.
01-02-2020T23:56:01,SpazztasticKiwi,“get off the computer and make a grilled cheese you absolute boob”
01-02-2020T23:56:17,Ordithus,"""at least eat a cold can of beans from the fridge"""

01-02-2020T23:56:49,KeefMcDerpface,(Insert many swear words.)
01-02-2020T23:57:30,SpazztasticKiwi,& I’ve had more sims than should’ve set themselves on fire
01-02-2020T23:57:50,KeefMcDerpface,0_0
01-02-2020T23:57:53,KeefMcDerpface,oh
01-02-2020T23:58:03,RimaDraws,lol
01-02-2020T23:58:16,AspiringNoodle,The tour of duty achievements are so much better
01-02-2020T23:58:35,AspiringNoodle,Get 1000 honor in war mode in each of the new zones
01-02-2020T23:58:38,Ordithus,"The espresso machine was life, until it broke and my non-skilled sim tried to fix"
01-02-2020T23:58:49,AspiringNoodle,More or less just enjoy LOTS of PvP in war mode and you'll eventually get them :D
01-02-2020T23:58:56,AspiringNoodle,Oh no...
01-02-2020T23:58:59,AspiringNoodle,Zap zap?
01-02-2020T23:59:00,Ordithus,:zap:
