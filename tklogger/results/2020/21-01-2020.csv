21-01-2020T18:43:48,TerraTheWizard,a what now?
21-01-2020T18:44:07,AspiringNoodle,$252 a year + tax for unlimited movies (with certain exceptions) and 10% off at the concession stand

21-01-2020T18:48:51,AspiringNoodle,Think of Regal Unlimited as a theater owned MoviePass
21-01-2020T18:50:15,AspiringNoodle,"It's probably a fair bit more expensive than MoviePass, but it's probably far more viable and could actually live up to its promises"
21-01-2020T18:50:26,SpazztasticKiwi,"for almost $300, I call it a waste of money"
21-01-2020T18:50:33,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t do movies that often
21-01-2020T18:50:46,AspiringNoodle,I do ;)

21-01-2020T18:57:23,AspiringNoodle,I haven't been seeing many movies recently because I've been trying to reign in my sleep schedule

21-01-2020T19:20:56,AspiringNoodle,"If I can get my sleep schedule under control, then I can tackle my entertainment consumption"
21-01-2020T19:21:30,AspiringNoodle,"Because it's hard to accurately gauge how much media you need to cut back when you go to sleep and wake up at random times, and spend anywhere from 6 - 12 hours sleeping"
21-01-2020T19:22:09,AspiringNoodle,"Flipside argument is... start doing art, prioritize that above all else.  And then decide what to cut out"
