03-04-2020T00:00:26,SageSaga,i think we mostly have barn owls and great horned owls
03-04-2020T00:01:25,FoxxTrotter,"Haven't seen a barn owl IRL yet. I've seen great horned owls at zoos, but not in the wild yet."
03-04-2020T00:02:04,ZRO4825,"Only time I think I've actually *seen* owls was at zoos, and when there was a Snowy Owl that was hanging out around here for some reason"
03-04-2020T00:02:11,SageSaga,i think we sometimes have saw-whet owls but not often
03-04-2020T00:02:38,SageSaga,saw-whet owls are adorable looking
03-04-2020T00:05:51,Almighty404,Owls are always a hoot.
03-04-2020T00:05:59,SageSaga,boooo
03-04-2020T00:06:01,SageSaga,bad pun
03-04-2020T00:06:30,FoxxTrotter,"""Give a hoot. Don't pollute."""
03-04-2020T00:06:36,FoxxTrotter,(old commercial)
03-04-2020T00:07:00,BlackjackSec99,"but the worse a pun is, the better it is."
03-04-2020T00:07:06,FoxxTrotter,About 25-30 years ago if I remember correctly.
03-04-2020T00:07:07,BlackjackSec99,pun's paradox
03-04-2020T00:08:52,SageSaga,no- a pun has to be reeeeeeeeally bad to be good- otherwise if it isnt a good clever pun - it's a waste of breath/typing
03-04-2020T00:09:04,FoxxTrotter,Yeah...Woodsy Owl. Back in the 1970's-1980's.
03-04-2020T00:14:00,Almighty404,She is the bone of her pillows
03-04-2020T00:15:20,Ordithus,can't say she didn't have it coming
03-04-2020T00:15:44,eric190,heyo!
03-04-2020T00:15:44,Ordithus,can only tease your friends so much
03-04-2020T00:15:53,FoxxTrotter,"Hi, Eric."
03-04-2020T00:15:59,eric190,i is now a robot lizard.
03-04-2020T00:22:09,eric190,how's everyone doing tonight?
03-04-2020T00:22:42,Ordithus,sleepsy
03-04-2020T00:22:47,CrimsonHelsing,"Pretty good, tired tho"
03-04-2020T00:25:03,AspiringNoodle,"Trying not to fall asleep early, haha"
03-04-2020T00:27:02,AspiringNoodle,"One more day of work, then 3 days off, woo~"
03-04-2020T00:28:28,CrimsonHelsing,Woot woot!
03-04-2020T00:29:47,AspiringNoodle,"Very woot, especially since the job is grinding on EVERYONE'S nerves now more than ever"
03-04-2020T00:30:19,Ordithus,cannot stay awake any longer
03-04-2020T00:30:20,AspiringNoodle,"I'm worried that we may lose some of our full time employees.  Or that some of hour newer ones may say, ""Naw, I'm out"""
03-04-2020T00:30:24,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-RainezZz: night
03-04-2020T00:30:26,AspiringNoodle,Ord
03-04-2020T00:30:30,FoxxTrotter,"I'm off to bed. G'night, everyone. :0)"
03-04-2020T00:30:31,AspiringNoodle,*heavy metal starts playing*
03-04-2020T00:30:34,FoxxTrotter,"G'night, Ord."
03-04-2020T00:30:38,Ordithus,night foxx
03-04-2020T00:30:50,AspiringNoodle,RIP
03-04-2020T00:31:49,CrimsonHelsing,"You're telling me xP I got comments from the boss today on a lackluster job the other day, which was only because they told me they'd take care of the rest after I got all the grease squuegee'd to a particular spot xP"
03-04-2020T00:32:27,AspiringNoodle,Our store was already tight on hours
03-04-2020T00:32:48,AspiringNoodle,But then they add this rather comprehensive cleaning regiment that we're *supposed* (key word: supposed) to do every 2 hours
03-04-2020T00:32:58,CrimsonHelsing,"These are the kind of bosses that if you try to explain, they drown you out/talk over you so they don't have to listen to you"
03-04-2020T00:33:18,AspiringNoodle,So we barely had the manpower to get things done to begin with.  And now they've reduced hours further
03-04-2020T00:33:25,AspiringNoodle,I hate corporate :ptv-unimpressed:
03-04-2020T00:33:52,AspiringNoodle,What makes it extra stupid is that it seems that morning shift is now solely managers and supervisors
03-04-2020T00:34:09,AspiringNoodle,"It was stupid to begin with, now it's extra stupid :upside_down:"
03-04-2020T00:34:35,AspiringNoodle,"Sage, how much would it cost so hire Nyna to dig up some dirt on the parent company?"
03-04-2020T00:34:44,SageSaga,now would be the time for whoever is making robots to introduce them as replacements for everyone
03-04-2020T00:34:57,AspiringNoodle,UBI while we're at it? :ptv-excited:
03-04-2020T00:35:04,CrimsonHelsing,Pfeh xD
03-04-2020T00:35:20,SageSaga,well before we get a UBI we first need people to realize they arent needed anymore
03-04-2020T00:35:40,SageSaga,and then the government will realize it needs people to be happy or else government stops working
03-04-2020T00:35:48,CrimsonHelsing,"Yeah, when robots are cheaper than human labor, that'd be the day lol"
03-04-2020T00:35:59,AspiringNoodle,Correction: Government will realize it needs people to LIVE or else it stops working
03-04-2020T00:35:59,SageSaga,they- they already are
03-04-2020T00:36:03,AspiringNoodle,^
03-04-2020T00:36:16,AspiringNoodle,"Cheaper, far more productive, more efficient"
03-04-2020T00:36:22,CrimsonHelsing,O.o;
03-04-2020T00:36:30,AspiringNoodle,The only thing holding it back is the fact that automation has a huge upfront cost
03-04-2020T00:36:43,AspiringNoodle,"And it's easier for businesses to eat the more expensive, but also way more spread out, cost of human labor"
03-04-2020T00:36:48,CrimsonHelsing,What about maintenance?
03-04-2020T00:36:50,SageSaga,they have a higher upfront cost but once bought they cost much less on maintenance and make less mistakes
03-04-2020T00:36:54,AspiringNoodle,^
03-04-2020T00:37:03,AspiringNoodle,Maintenance is a pittance compared to human costs
03-04-2020T00:37:16,AspiringNoodle,"Pay (salary or hourly), insurance, benefits, retirement"
03-04-2020T00:37:31,SageSaga,instead of paying someone 7 dollars per hour the cost to maintain the robots is like a dollar a week
03-04-2020T00:37:41,AspiringNoodle,"Machine: Can work without rest, only costs extra money when it breaks down or schedule maintenance.  Only retirement cost is a newer, better machine"
03-04-2020T00:37:57,CrimsonHelsing,Yow
03-04-2020T00:38:14,AspiringNoodle,"For most of human history, machines worked as productivity multipliers"
03-04-2020T00:38:28,AspiringNoodle,They worked WITH humans to increase the productivity of the average worker by untold amounts
03-04-2020T00:38:44,AspiringNoodle,"But with the advent of automation, and now AI making smart machines, they can completely replace the worker"
03-04-2020T00:39:20,CrimsonHelsing,In most aspects a bad idea
03-04-2020T00:39:33,AspiringNoodle,I've used self-order kiosks at McDonald's.  They're SUPER convenient.  I can browse the entire menu at my own leisure
03-04-2020T00:39:36,SageSaga,and all the economists think we'll just come up with all new jobs- while others are saying this is a horse vs car situation- human workers are horses- cars are automation
03-04-2020T00:39:40,AspiringNoodle,I can make edits to my order
03-04-2020T00:40:00,Dadrobit,Automation is the global warming of the job market.
03-04-2020T00:40:05,SageSaga,how many horses do you see every day?
03-04-2020T00:40:16,AspiringNoodle,"I can see things at a moments notice that might not be on the menu, or are on those stupid animated screens"
03-04-2020T00:41:00,Dadrobit,"""New Technology always creates more jobs! Look at Uber and Lyft"" is like saying ""Look! We just had a really cold winter! Global warming is a myth."""
03-04-2020T00:41:04,AspiringNoodle,"Horses of the past: Primary driver of the economy.  Commuting, moving of goods."
03-04-2020T00:41:28,AspiringNoodle,Horses of today: Primarily a luxury or for entertainment.
03-04-2020T00:41:29,SageSaga,i totally believe new jobs will be created- i just dont think enough of them will be XD
03-04-2020T00:41:55,AspiringNoodle,I have a different idea
03-04-2020T00:42:03,SageSaga,XD Humans working a front desk will become a sign of wealth?
03-04-2020T00:42:13,AspiringNoodle,"New jobs will be created.  But lower skilled and low paying, or extremely high skilled and limited in supply :)"
03-04-2020T00:42:23,Dadrobit,Sage. Completely unironically. Yes. That is exactly it.
03-04-2020T00:42:40,AspiringNoodle,"A good example of the threat of automation, the trucking industry"
03-04-2020T00:42:46,SageSaga,rich people will treat him/her like a rare treat for their amusement
03-04-2020T00:43:15,Dadrobit,That's my job secuirty. Mobile robot security is already a thing. But my clients would never agree to that.
03-04-2020T00:43:15,AspiringNoodle,The trucking industry employs 8.7 million people
03-04-2020T00:43:24,CrimsonHelsing,"Gotta admit tho, you can never really phase out human employment ;P"
03-04-2020T00:43:43,SageSaga,"it's like John Henry vs the Steam machine! Such a great story of man beating machine! ""Uhhhhh- you do know how it ends- right?"""
03-04-2020T00:43:48,AspiringNoodle,"If self-driving trucks become a HUGE improvement in terms of cost-benefit for the industry, say goodbye to millions of well-paying jobs"
03-04-2020T00:43:50,CrimsonHelsing,Not as much as corporate America would want anyway
03-04-2020T00:43:53,Dadrobit,They just want a concierge with a badge. So they pay me and my cohorts. A robot isn't a substitute for my position. (at the moment)
03-04-2020T00:44:14,SageSaga,spoiler- John Henry dies from exhaustion and they make a newer faster machine
03-04-2020T00:44:56,Dadrobit,"More realistically. Self driving trucks will not be piloted ""100%"" by AI. More like planes with pilots where 99% of their job is automated."
03-04-2020T00:45:03,AspiringNoodle,"UBI probably could be funded, but we'd need to close down all these tax loopholes"
03-04-2020T00:45:19,Dadrobit,But the new drivers are gonna be paid trash and they'll undercut all the currently employed truckers.
03-04-2020T00:45:36,CrimsonHelsing,Looks like business is always gonna have to figure it out the hard way; they'll always need people to get the job done
03-04-2020T00:45:38,AspiringNoodle,"As well as stop being lenient on corporations, who have TIME AND TIME AGAIN shown that when they get tax breaks, they use the newly available funds to either enrich themselves further, or lobby politicians to maintain or increase their goodies"
03-04-2020T00:45:57,Dadrobit,"Having a human driver is great for liability. If there's an accident, just blame it on the minimum wage human, fire them, and get new fodder."
03-04-2020T00:46:09,AspiringNoodle,We should also probably start tracking down offshore accounts in tax havens
03-04-2020T00:46:28,AspiringNoodle,Nothing says trickle-down economics like wealthy people smuggling their wealth out of their home countries and hiding it from the world :P
03-04-2020T00:46:44,SageSaga,there is a point where capitalism stops being a benefit to everyone and becomes a benefit only to those at the top- but people dont want to admit it
03-04-2020T00:46:49,Dadrobit,"They're tracked perfectly. The problem is the ones in power tracking them, are the ones who set them up."
03-04-2020T00:47:12,eric190,"and that all starts by getting people to vote, and removing the people who benefit from this stuff from office."
03-04-2020T00:47:26,AspiringNoodle,I want to wake people up to the fact that the last round of tax cuts corporations got resulted in them benefiting only the people at the top
03-04-2020T00:47:37,AspiringNoodle,There was a company that went from owing billions to have an effective tax rate of 0
03-04-2020T00:47:53,SageSaga,amazon?
03-04-2020T00:47:56,AspiringNoodle,"Instead of investing back into the company like they promised, they used all the freed-up ex-tax money to buy back stocks"
03-04-2020T00:48:13,SageSaga,sounds like amazon
03-04-2020T00:48:18,AspiringNoodle,"Thus increasing stock value and enriching the investors, stockholders, and people at the top of the company"
03-04-2020T00:48:29,AspiringNoodle,Literally just leeching off the company to enrich themselves further
03-04-2020T00:49:06,AspiringNoodle,"We've also seen investment from companies trend downward after the tax breaks, showing that when they don't have to work hard for their money, they'll take the easy route"
03-04-2020T00:50:26,AspiringNoodle,"Politically, I'm moderate, but the more I read about modern economics, the more I'm like, ""Tax the rich to hell and back.  They'll work harder to keep making their money :)"""
03-04-2020T00:50:27,SageSaga,"i actually think CEOs and such should make tons of money on their success- i just think there's a limit - a point where you go ""Do i really need 100 Million every year? I only spend like 5 million in a year- if i cut it to 50 million id' be fine and could"
03-04-2020T00:50:36,SageSaga,"put that money towards more workers and buildings-"""
03-04-2020T00:50:49,AspiringNoodle,"Good point, sage!"
03-04-2020T00:51:06,AspiringNoodle,I actually have a GREAT example of how American CEO's are pretty effing greedy in this regard :D
03-04-2020T00:51:20,eric190,"nonono, you gotta think like them ""i make 100 million a year. i want more money. what can i do to make 150?"""
03-04-2020T00:51:41,SageSaga,Meanwhile Bezos is making 1.5 billion dollars a week
03-04-2020T00:52:06,eric190,still not enough money. gotta get all the money until you're the only one that has any.
03-04-2020T00:52:40,AspiringNoodle,"Tbf, if I remember correctly, most of Bezos' money comes from stock value"
03-04-2020T00:52:57,AspiringNoodle,His actual salary is pretty modest
03-04-2020T00:53:16,BadFoMo,How/what is Bezo?
03-04-2020T00:53:26,AspiringNoodle,"Jeff Bezos, founder / CEO of Amazon"
03-04-2020T00:53:33,BadFoMo,Thanks.
03-04-2020T00:53:47,AspiringNoodle,"And I just did a quick double check.  His salary went up from the last time I checked, but his yearly compensation is only $81,840"
03-04-2020T00:54:03,AspiringNoodle,The rest of his money is from the 16% share he owns
03-04-2020T00:54:19,SageSaga,yeah but he can leverage that at almost any time
03-04-2020T00:54:44,AspiringNoodle,"True!  But if he ever sells off his stock, that's subject to capital gains tax"
03-04-2020T00:54:59,SageSaga,oh no!
03-04-2020T00:55:04,SageSaga,not capital gains tax!
03-04-2020T00:55:46,AspiringNoodle,But Bezos is an easy target.  I got a greedier a-hole I want to villify
03-04-2020T00:56:05,SageSaga,he's have to pay 20% on tax! How - reasonable?
03-04-2020T00:56:07,AspiringNoodle,Bobby Kotick.  CEO of Activision-Blizzard.  I have a personal hard-on for wanting to see this man fail.
03-04-2020T00:56:11,BadFoMo,EA?
03-04-2020T00:56:26,BadFoMo,"Meh, close enough."
03-04-2020T00:56:51,AspiringNoodle,Activision makes 6.5 - 7.5 billion in revenue a year.  With about .5 - 1.5 billion in profit
03-04-2020T00:57:16,AspiringNoodle,"Bobby recieves an annual salary of almost $29,000,000.  With other benefits / bonuses, that goes above $32,000,000"
03-04-2020T00:57:29,AspiringNoodle,Let's compare him to the CEO of Sony
03-04-2020T00:57:52,AspiringNoodle,Kenichiro Yoshida.
03-04-2020T00:58:00,SageSaga,i dont think bezos is a bad person - i just think hes got more money than he'll ever need and he doesnt seem to put it towards a lot of good things
03-04-2020T00:58:15,SageSaga,when he gives a cause 100k- that's like giving them a penny to him
03-04-2020T00:58:18,AspiringNoodle,"This man makes $4,900,000 a year.  In the recent past, it was only $3,000,000"
03-04-2020T00:58:35,AspiringNoodle,The difference?  SONY'S REVENUE IS ALMOST 10X HIGHER THAN ACTI-BLIZZ
03-04-2020T00:58:58,AspiringNoodle,"$75,000,000,000 +/- several billion"
03-04-2020T00:59:17,AspiringNoodle,Kotick makes 6 - 10x more money than the CEO of effing Sony
03-04-2020T00:59:24,AspiringNoodle,When his company makes 10x less
03-04-2020T00:59:45,AspiringNoodle,How 'bout them apples?
03-04-2020T01:00:34,SageSaga,is bill gates like the only decent rich person?
03-04-2020T01:00:47,AspiringNoodle,Probably!
03-04-2020T01:00:52,SageSaga,sorry- Super rich
03-04-2020T01:01:01,SageSaga,"there are plenty of great ""rich"" people-"
03-04-2020T01:01:35,SageSaga,"Bezos is just like ""ive got so much money the only way to waste it is to spend it on space travel"""
03-04-2020T01:01:43,SageSaga,so he does-
03-04-2020T01:02:51,AspiringNoodle,"Personally, I can't see myself ever wanting to keep that much money if it ever came into my possession"
03-04-2020T01:03:30,AspiringNoodle,"I'm a gamer, straight up.  And while you can go nuts with a computer build, you'd have to try REALLY hard to spend over $100k.  Even on a workstation"
03-04-2020T01:04:27,SageSaga,its like- do you count the building of a house for the system?
03-04-2020T01:04:41,AspiringNoodle,"If I tried to do that, please shoot me"
03-04-2020T01:04:59,SageSaga,i would totally build a house to be PC friendly
03-04-2020T01:05:11,SageSaga,easy routing of 10GB networking and better power
03-04-2020T01:05:27,AspiringNoodle,"That might be a bit different, lol"
03-04-2020T01:05:39,AspiringNoodle,"If you're building a super tech-friendly house, that seems like a reasonable 1-time investment"
03-04-2020T01:05:50,SageSaga,heck yeah
03-04-2020T01:05:58,AspiringNoodle,Especially since you probably wouldn't go through the headache of doing it multiple times ;P
03-04-2020T01:06:24,SageSaga,you could build a server with multiple connections and have Virtual pcs set up all around the house for people to use for whatever- and still have a gaming rig
03-04-2020T01:06:52,SageSaga,actually- Linus from Linus tech tips did that at his house
03-04-2020T01:07:45,AspiringNoodle,"I think the splurgiest I'd ever get beyond that would be an arcade room, a home theater (like, a dedicated theater room meant to replicate the cinema experience), and / or game-themed rooms"
03-04-2020T01:08:02,AspiringNoodle,You should see that couple that modeled their basement after Skyrim as the dedicated game lounge
03-04-2020T01:08:06,AspiringNoodle,I want it :ptv-excited:
03-04-2020T01:08:40,SageSaga,my dream home is a wizard tower
03-04-2020T01:09:37,AspiringNoodle,"Sage, want link? :3"
03-04-2020T01:09:48,SageSaga,sure
03-04-2020T01:09:51,AspiringNoodle,https://imgur.com/gallery/x6CHN
03-04-2020T01:09:56,AspiringNoodle,"Is thing of beauty, it is~"
03-04-2020T01:11:01,SageSaga,sweet
03-04-2020T01:11:34,BadFoMo,"A little to much for me, but I like it."
03-04-2020T01:12:15,SageSaga,for my wizard tower though- glass elevator in the center- ground floor is a welcoming floor with themed seating area- elevator goes to second floor with Kitchen/bar and gaming area + bathroom- top floor has master bedroom and office + bathroom- and roof
03-04-2020T01:12:18,SageSaga,access
03-04-2020T01:13:10,AspiringNoodle,"Rich business person: Wants more money, multiple mansions, expensive sports / super / hyper cars, yachts, personal jets,"
03-04-2020T01:13:17,BadFoMo,Like the Lucky 38 from Fallout New Vegas?
03-04-2020T01:13:27,SageSaga,the glass elevator would have RGB to make it looked like it glows with magical energy

03-04-2020T01:22:58,BadFoMo,I think it's been cancled.
03-04-2020T01:24:00,JojoF2415,I was going to beat deadlocked but got a 82% fail :ptv-sad:
03-04-2020T01:24:17,BadFoMo,Hmm?
03-04-2020T01:26:04,Dadrobit,:( Now I wanna look at homes for myself. Even though I still am working on saving up
03-04-2020T01:26:58,BadFoMo,You can still look; you just can't buy.

03-04-2020T01:32:42,SageSaga,isnt the housing market suspected to go down due to this?
03-04-2020T01:32:50,SageSaga,or is it already?
03-04-2020T01:33:49,BadFoMo,Due to what?
03-04-2020T01:34:00,ZRO4825,"No clue, personally. I have paid NO attention to the housing market thus far."
03-04-2020T01:34:04,AspiringNoodle,I'm curious to see if the market made the same exact mistakes as the 2008 bubble burst
03-04-2020T01:34:13,SageSaga,the virus crashing almost everything
03-04-2020T01:34:13,ZRO4825,"It basically lies in the realm of ""Out of my reach"" no matter what it does, lol"
03-04-2020T01:34:19,BadFoMo,Thanks.
03-04-2020T01:34:22,Dadrobit,"Our economy is in the shitter, lots of folks losing their homes. Cheap forclosures everywhere, the rest of the market will dip to match for a while"
03-04-2020T01:34:38,BadFoMo,What happened in 08?
03-04-2020T01:34:40,AspiringNoodle,Did you guys know that they made a movie about the 2008 housing market crash?
03-04-2020T01:35:08,SageSaga,the housing market bubble burst and a ton of money was lost
03-04-2020T01:35:15,AspiringNoodle,It's called The Big Short.  It explains EXACTLY what happened
03-04-2020T01:35:34,AspiringNoodle,"As well as detailed an investing savant who was able to predict what happened, and came up with a new kind of insurance policy"
03-04-2020T01:35:51,Dadrobit,Housing bubble. Bad loans were given to everybody without telling the investors. Eventually loans started falling through. Caused a chain reaction of everyone pulling out. Everyone pulls out and the 401k's go in the shitter.
03-04-2020T01:35:55,Twokinds,jirka: I'd like to stream but I can't tonight
03-04-2020T01:36:16,AspiringNoodle,Banks more or less gave out ludicrous amounts of sub-prime loans
03-04-2020T01:36:26,AspiringNoodle,"Loans that have a high chance of defaulting (aka, not being paid)"
03-04-2020T01:36:46,AspiringNoodle,And then they bundled things together to reduce the overall risk and sold them
03-04-2020T01:37:09,Twokinds,"I haven't seen the big short, but I've watched several documentories about 2008. It's very interesting."
03-04-2020T01:37:22,Dadrobit,"^^^^ So when part of the system fell through, everyone fell through."
03-04-2020T01:37:43,AspiringNoodle,The worst part?  the taxpayers bailed out the dipwads who ruined the economy on purpose
03-04-2020T01:38:02,AspiringNoodle,The people at the top of the financial systems who caused the whole mess to happen honestly should have been jailed
03-04-2020T01:38:39,Dadrobit,"Parents were able to capitalize on it themselves. Bought half a dozen forclosed fixer-uppers. Renovated them over a couple years, now they've almost finished paying them all off."
03-04-2020T01:38:40,SageSaga,economics is complicated- it seems like it should be simple since its mostly math- until you realize a person can say something wrong and make everyone think somethings going to happen and they over react to it and it causes a massive human error that
03-04-2020T01:38:45,SageSaga,cascades forever
03-04-2020T01:39:30,SageSaga,yeah but a lot of those had to be bailed out
03-04-2020T01:39:33,JojoF2415,I can’t believe I haven’t beaten deadlocked after 10 months
03-04-2020T01:39:49,AspiringNoodle,I'm not so mad that we bailed them out
03-04-2020T01:40:08,AspiringNoodle,I'm mad that the people responsible got off scot free
03-04-2020T01:40:10,SageSaga,"it kinda works like this ""If we dont bail them out- its going to destroy hundreds of thousands of peoples lives that had nothing to do with it"
03-04-2020T01:40:15,Dadrobit,":Too big to fail"""
03-04-2020T01:40:42,AspiringNoodle,Privatized gains; socialized losses.  My favorite phrase of modern year ;)
03-04-2020T01:41:12,SageSaga,"""Im sorry Wells Fargo- but you screwed up and now have to pay the price-"" ""Ok- no one gets their money from us till we settle this-"" ""Wait - what? No! I have my money here!"""
03-04-2020T01:41:44,Dadrobit,"Still sucks. The corporate assholse were able to put all the blame on the government for their failure. ""If the government doesn't bail us out, then that means the government WANTS the people to suffer."""
03-04-2020T01:42:02,Dadrobit,So the govt. is put inbetween a rock and a hard place.
03-04-2020T01:42:14,SageSaga,however-
03-04-2020T01:42:25,SageSaga,the banks for the most part did end up paying it all back
03-04-2020T01:42:38,Dadrobit,"Yeah, and the auto industry did as well."
03-04-2020T01:42:45,SageSaga,just not with as much intrest as they charged people <_<
03-04-2020T01:42:47,AspiringNoodle,"Yeah, but how much you want to bet the people who milked these messes didn't pay a single dime?"
03-04-2020T01:43:23,Dadrobit,Unlike the current farm bailout bullshit happening. That money  is ~gone~~~
03-04-2020T01:43:26,SageSaga,oh im sure they did- but they can lose a 100 billion dimes and be fine
03-04-2020T01:44:10,AspiringNoodle,I wonder what it will take to stop this race to the bottom capitalism seems obsessed with
03-04-2020T01:44:19,SageSaga,im not familiar with that - what is that about Robit?
03-04-2020T01:44:52,BadFoMo,@AspiringNoodle ...Zombie Outbreak?
03-04-2020T01:45:03,SageSaga,also - just to be clear- im capitalist to a point- we are just seeing some of those points now XD
03-04-2020T01:45:29,AspiringNoodle,"Oh yeah, no Capitalism is great.  It's just that we've let it run amok for far too long"
03-04-2020T01:46:03,SageSaga,"i think there's a point where you can legit have ""enough money"" and should be required to use it for a cause the benefits society or raises up the lower class"
03-04-2020T01:46:21,AspiringNoodle,"Some years ago, I realized that pure ideological systems are bound to fail"
03-04-2020T01:47:04,AspiringNoodle,"And it's always for the same reason. Humans.  Humans can be greedy, corrupt, selfish."
03-04-2020T01:47:24,AspiringNoodle,They will twist and bend and manipulate anything to their advantage
03-04-2020T01:47:52,AspiringNoodle,Soviet Russia is a prime example.  They were OBSESSED with efficiency.  Only one company per product.
03-04-2020T01:47:53,Dadrobit,"Tarrifs with China fucked our agriculture industry. $8.4billion dollars went into agriculture to try and keep it afloat. It isn't working. But more importantly, that money was 100% a gift."
03-04-2020T01:47:59,Dadrobit,Never being paid back
03-04-2020T01:48:23,SageSaga,ah you said now so i assumed it was something new- but thats not new
03-04-2020T01:48:38,AspiringNoodle,A huge part of communism was you'd only get one choice.  But guess who got an extra choice?  Officials of the government.
03-04-2020T01:48:47,Dadrobit,"Well, I mean, it's still going on."
03-04-2020T01:48:58,SageSaga,yeah that money isnt getting paid back- but i do think it is mostly worth keeping them around because we do rely on their food
03-04-2020T01:49:16,AspiringNoodle,"Soviet Russia had TWO vehicles you could actually *choose* from.  But I say *choose* because regular people got one version, and government officials got the objectively better car."
03-04-2020T01:49:30,SageSaga,they could cut back on production but then it will cost a lot to ramp back up production once they stop to cut back
03-04-2020T01:50:21,SageSaga,"""you can have one of these two apples!"" ""Well - I have a gun- so i take both apples!"" ""Enjoy your apples!"""

03-04-2020T01:52:35,AspiringNoodle,"""What's the pay?"" ""I get to live!"""
03-04-2020T01:52:42,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-laugh:
03-04-2020T01:53:19,Dadrobit,"Sorry, it's up to 22 billion now. Also, like everything else, the lion's share is going to the wealthiest farms while smaller ones are left to foreclose and be bought out."
03-04-2020T01:54:36,SageSaga,ah- the law of the jungle- big cat waits for little cats to die and then they take their stuff... wait
03-04-2020T01:55:12,Dadrobit,"As of August of last year, the bottom 80% of all farms only received $5000. The wealthy top 1% each took in $180,000."
03-04-2020T01:55:51,SageSaga,well that would make sense if their costs are that much higher
03-04-2020T01:56:18,AspiringNoodle,Part of the problem is that food is so cheap
03-04-2020T01:56:33,SageSaga,that's a good thing though-
03-04-2020T01:56:36,AspiringNoodle,"And so in order to make enough money to actually make a living, you need super expensive farm equipment"
03-04-2020T01:56:59,AspiringNoodle,But the farm may not be large enough to support that kind of equipment AND making a living
03-04-2020T01:57:17,AspiringNoodle,"But because it's the only way the small farm can compete with the large farm, they have to buy it anyways"
03-04-2020T01:57:25,Dadrobit,The delta between the top 1% should not be 36+ to 1 against everything below 80%.
03-04-2020T01:57:47,SageSaga,doesnt that depend on how much the cost for those all to run?
03-04-2020T01:58:00,AspiringNoodle,"Farms are businesses plain, and simple"
03-04-2020T01:58:28,SageSaga,basically- everyone should be given enough to keep them going- it makes sense for the biggest to get the most and to get it first because they support the most workers and produce the most product
03-04-2020T01:59:07,Dadrobit,These are the mega ag businesses that are already well established and can take the tariff cuts. It's the small farms that were already running on empty trying to compete with the large industries that needs the help more than ever.
03-04-2020T01:59:15,SageSaga,my guess though is the bigger ones arent cutting back where they can to reduce cost and are getting more than they need and not leaving it for the smaller ones that arent getting enough
03-04-2020T02:00:28,Dadrobit,The 1% saw a cut to their profit margins. The 80% saw the family farm disappear.
03-04-2020T02:00:57,Dadrobit,We shouldn't be using disproportionate amounts of taxpayer dollars to fund profit margins
03-04-2020T02:01:01,SageSaga,why is farmer approval up so high though?
03-04-2020T02:01:28,Dadrobit,Because they're all red states that have been slashing education funding for decades now?
03-04-2020T02:01:35,SageSaga,XD
03-04-2020T02:01:45,SageSaga,"""They  are stupid"" is not the best answer-"
03-04-2020T02:01:58,SageSaga,cant argue with it much though
03-04-2020T02:02:09,Dadrobit,It's not inaccurate though....
03-04-2020T02:02:37,SageSaga,i dont know how well we could prove it though
03-04-2020T02:02:52,SageSaga,is their polling data on the education of most people who run farms?
03-04-2020T02:03:29,Dadrobit,Smaller farms are getting fucked though. Bankruptcy claims are up 40% from 2016.
03-04-2020T02:04:01,SageSaga,i guess you would have to poll them on who they blame to get an idea
03-04-2020T02:04:32,SageSaga,"if they blame China then they dont know how Tariffs work so  you could make them as ""stupid"" XD"
03-04-2020T02:05:02,SageSaga,if you are in a business being hurt by tariffs you need to learn what tariffs are
03-04-2020T02:06:21,SageSaga,ah... found it
03-04-2020T02:06:40,SageSaga,majority of farmers support tariffs
03-04-2020T02:06:45,Dadrobit,"S'pose their reaction likely depends on whether they got $5,000, or $50,000."
03-04-2020T02:07:31,SageSaga,"this is mostly smaller farmers- they think its in their best interest - that they are going to bring in more profits once they 'win"""
03-04-2020T02:07:31,Dadrobit,"I know one farmer who got burned is now running for Governor in Ohio I believe to try and ""Fix"" things."
03-04-2020T02:09:09,SageSaga,does he seem legit or does he seem like a joke?
03-04-2020T02:09:28,Dadrobit,"""Gibbs, 61, voted for Trump in 2016 as a member of the Republican Party and served as chair of the local GOP. But he stepped down after becoming dismayed at Trump’s agricultural and trade policies and disillusioned at the direction his party was heading"""
03-04-2020T02:10:44,SageSaga,"we did just say most farmers are ""stupid"" (in some areas they seem to be misinformed is a nicer way of putting it) but that doesnt also mean they are all stupid- ive seen plenty and met very intelligent farmers"
03-04-2020T02:11:19,Dadrobit,"""my life’s mission from here on out is to ensure that agriculture is never, ever put front and center in a geopolitical war again, like we’ve seen now.”"
03-04-2020T02:11:23,SageSaga,so if a farmer wants to go into politics and knows what they are talking about- and will be representing a big farming population that would be a good thing imo
03-04-2020T02:11:57,SageSaga,i think representatives should represent their people
03-04-2020T02:12:10,Dadrobit,Currently running as an independent
03-04-2020T02:12:26,SageSaga,well hes not going anywhere
03-04-2020T02:12:59,AspiringNoodle,"Tbh, I wish we'd stop delegating manufacturing of everything to China c:"
03-04-2020T02:13:01,SageSaga,XD - i dont know the make up of the political parties there
03-04-2020T02:13:21,SageSaga,why? they do it so cheap and effectively!
03-04-2020T02:13:50,Dadrobit,"Sorry, not governor, Representative."
03-04-2020T02:14:00,AspiringNoodle,"Sage, do I really need to spell it out? lol"
03-04-2020T02:14:07,SageSaga,yes
03-04-2020T02:14:09,Dadrobit,Jim Jordan (R) is the guy he's trying to unseat.
03-04-2020T02:15:00,AspiringNoodle,*gears turning*
03-04-2020T02:15:04,AspiringNoodle,"Sage, are you trolling me? xD"
03-04-2020T02:15:42,SageSaga,nope- we are not setup for manufacturing and creating it all would take a ton of money and time and tech for making it green
03-04-2020T02:15:56,SageSaga,and that means it would produce expensive things
03-04-2020T02:16:08,AspiringNoodle,Well then!  I point to the current pandemic as to why letting China make the majority of our medical products was a bad decision
03-04-2020T02:16:22,Dadrobit,"Yeah, manufacturing is not coming back to  America en mass anytime in the even remotely close future."
03-04-2020T02:16:36,SageSaga,then i will point out that that doesnt have anything to do with the pandemic
03-04-2020T02:17:06,SageSaga,if 3D printing tech continues to grow i can see manufacturing moving more
03-04-2020T02:17:43,AspiringNoodle,"I wnat to get into this conversation, but it's late"
03-04-2020T02:17:55,AspiringNoodle,And it would take way too long to get my point across
03-04-2020T02:17:58,Dadrobit,"Eh, even still, the nature of it means that it can be employed most anywhere I think so long as the initial investment is reasonable."
03-04-2020T02:18:09,SageSaga,you can probably sum it up
03-04-2020T02:18:26,Dadrobit,America isn't gonna have a monopoly in it is what I'm meaning in that sense.
03-04-2020T02:18:28,AspiringNoodle,"So I'll sum it up as such, China's government is EXTREMELY authoritarian.  They actively suppress information from their own citizens, and try to suppress information from other countries"
03-04-2020T02:18:55,AspiringNoodle,"In addition, they've started flexing access to their market as a way for foreign companies to play ball with their way of doing things"
03-04-2020T02:19:33,AspiringNoodle,"Essentially, using the global market to subtly spread their influence.  Remember the hearthstone controversy?"
03-04-2020T02:20:37,SageSaga,and NBA stuff yeah
03-04-2020T02:20:45,AspiringNoodle,Basically that
03-04-2020T02:20:55,AspiringNoodle,"So, I must pose the question"
03-04-2020T02:20:57,Dadrobit,And... Ya know.... Tienanmen Square....
03-04-2020T02:21:05,SageSaga,however the production of materials using the world market has massive benefits for the world
03-04-2020T02:21:27,AspiringNoodle,"yes, but counterpoint"
03-04-2020T02:21:29,SageSaga,we can use other countries to enrich ourselves- while also playing the political games
03-04-2020T02:21:45,AspiringNoodle,Think about those controversies
03-04-2020T02:22:11,AspiringNoodle,"Where China didn't like what certain people said, and threatened to outright ban certain businesses from their market?"
03-04-2020T02:22:24,SageSaga,yeah and we threatened them back
03-04-2020T02:22:47,AspiringNoodle,Imagine if they gained a monopoly on the production of certain goods?
03-04-2020T02:22:59,AspiringNoodle,"And then suddenly decided, ""We don't like you, we won't sell you this stuff."""
03-04-2020T02:23:26,SageSaga,"then the UN would say ""then you lose our business too because we have trade agreements"""
03-04-2020T02:24:02,AspiringNoodle,Never forget that was is ALWAYS a possibility
03-04-2020T02:24:02,SageSaga,there are balances in place- when someone throws their weight around we use allies to throw it back
03-04-2020T02:24:09,AspiringNoodle,war*
03-04-2020T02:24:27,SageSaga,war is far less profitable now
03-04-2020T02:24:53,AspiringNoodle,"True, but war is generally the result of irreconcilable differences in ideology"
03-04-2020T02:25:14,AspiringNoodle,That or profit.  Humans tend to like either.
03-04-2020T02:25:18,SageSaga,what we should do is strengthen our over seas alliances rather than trying to be self sufficient and isolated
03-04-2020T02:25:37,AspiringNoodle,"Tbh, why not both?"
03-04-2020T02:25:47,AspiringNoodle,Why not bolster them while also being capable of competing?
03-04-2020T02:26:01,SageSaga,because isolationist brews supremacy
03-04-2020T02:26:08,AspiringNoodle,Not the isolationist stuff
03-04-2020T02:26:27,SageSaga,what do you mean by both?
03-04-2020T02:26:45,SageSaga,because self sufficiency creates isolationism
03-04-2020T02:27:02,SageSaga,"you start saying ""Well if you arent going to give us what we want we will make it ourselves"""
03-04-2020T02:27:09,SageSaga,and you isolate yourself
03-04-2020T02:27:18,SageSaga,its 2 sides of the same coin
03-04-2020T02:27:40,AspiringNoodle,"But at the same time, if everyone relies on one source of something, it becomes prone to disruption"
03-04-2020T02:27:54,SageSaga,yeah but we dont
03-04-2020T02:28:13,SageSaga,"we do some manufacturing here- Mexico does a lot, Taiwan, Korea"
03-04-2020T02:28:13,AspiringNoodle,We more or less rely on china for our medicines
03-04-2020T02:28:17,Dadrobit,Isolatinoism is another form of relying on one source.
03-04-2020T02:29:00,SageSaga,we get a lot of medicine from China but because they are cheaper- other places can and do make medicine too
03-04-2020T02:29:37,SageSaga,heck the us has medicine manufacturing and they could expand for emergencies but the cost is an issue in a place that has some of the worse healthcare in the modern world
03-04-2020T02:30:18,Dadrobit,"S'why the tariffs with China hurt us more than China. They just said, ""Oh, you're trying to disrupt this source of food? Okay, we'll just pay slightly more to get it elsewhere."""
03-04-2020T02:31:03,Dadrobit,Suddenly American farmers lost their biggest client completely.
03-04-2020T02:31:35,SageSaga,"oh and also - if China said ""US doesnt get medicine anymore"" canada might be like ""Eh- thats a 50 billion dollar deal right there- eh? Lets start making meds for our friends down south eh?"""
03-04-2020T02:32:17,Dadrobit,"In a worldwide market, monopolies only last as long as it takes for greed to undercut itself."
03-04-2020T02:32:32,Dadrobit,Greed and shitty decisions
03-04-2020T02:33:02,AspiringNoodle,"That said, even if these new deals pop up, they would take time to get moving"
03-04-2020T02:33:43,AspiringNoodle,"Also, I will agree that the tariff war with china was stupid :/"
03-04-2020T02:33:45,SageSaga,"US to Canada - ""We cant pay you more-"" Canada - ""Oh that ok! Just pay the same in shipping even though its cheaper!"""
03-04-2020T02:34:41,SageSaga,i hope you all read that in a terrible canadian accent btw
03-04-2020T02:35:21,AspiringNoodle,"""Sounds like a great deal, eh?"""
03-04-2020T02:35:26,Dadrobit,French Canadian. The most terrible of Canadian accents.
03-04-2020T02:35:51,AspiringNoodle,"Oh god, just had flashbacks to my first trip to canada xD"
03-04-2020T02:35:59,SageSaga,"it would be more likely Mexico would produce em though- then ""Eh man, now you want are drugs, eh?"""
03-04-2020T02:36:06,SageSaga,our* not are
03-04-2020T02:36:21,AspiringNoodle,"First sentence from the first Canadian I ever interacted with, question ended with "", eh?"""
03-04-2020T02:37:01,ZRO4825,"Depends which mexican you talk to, it very well might be are instead of our. :P"
03-04-2020T02:37:17,SageSaga,i have a Canadian friend and whenever he says Eh i giggle
03-04-2020T02:37:56,AspiringNoodle,Hmmm.... I worry about China's citizens in all honesty...
03-04-2020T02:38:10,SageSaga,yeah that stuff is messed up
03-04-2020T02:38:17,AspiringNoodle,"Politics, yes, but also their economic situation"
03-04-2020T02:38:32,SageSaga,and something should be done- but that something shouldnt hurt my supply of GPUs and CPUs
03-04-2020T02:38:33,Dadrobit,The Chinese who live in lockstep with the government will be fine.
03-04-2020T02:38:49,Dadrobit,Everyone else? Notsomuch
03-04-2020T02:38:53,AspiringNoodle,"Recent story (past 1 - 2 years), people in China with STEM degrees not getting jobs because without the government assistance on housing, they couldn't afford where they live"
03-04-2020T02:39:21,AspiringNoodle,"part of how things from China are so cheap,  their people are paid just so"
03-04-2020T02:39:54,SageSaga,actually a lot of their jobs in manufacturing have been automated
03-04-2020T02:39:55,AspiringNoodle,Which is ironic since China can assemble teams of STEM professionals in amounts of time unheard of everywhere else in the world
03-04-2020T02:40:44,DarthRexKing,Going to sleep now. o3o
03-04-2020T02:40:58,AspiringNoodle,"Awww, but we're having such a fun talk about politics!"
03-04-2020T02:41:23,SageSaga,gnight Dath
03-04-2020T02:41:25,SageSaga,Darth*
03-04-2020T02:41:31,Dadrobit,This recent pandemic is helping automation accelerate in general as well. Manufacturers realizing that humans getting sick en mass is bad for production. Machines are far less susceptible to Covid.
03-04-2020T02:41:39,Dadrobit,o/ Darth
03-04-2020T02:41:54,SageSaga,far less is an understatement XD
03-04-2020T02:42:05,AspiringNoodle,"Arguably, mass automation means that manufacturing could pop everywhere"
03-04-2020T02:42:29,AspiringNoodle,Just need the initial investment and then you start making bank
03-04-2020T02:43:11,Dadrobit,"Depends, you need to lease the rights to whatever you're manufacturing."
03-04-2020T02:43:24,SageSaga,"""alright- your resume looks good- but how susceptible are you to illness?"" ""Being a robot- I am one hundred percent immune to any biological virus"" ""Good- the last guy was very susceptible"""
03-04-2020T02:43:36,DarthRexKing,\o
03-04-2020T02:44:00,DarthRexKing,I'll hear more poli-DICKS later! X'D
03-04-2020T02:44:01,DarthRexKing,XP
03-04-2020T02:44:05,AspiringNoodle,True.  But it could also potentially reduce greenhouse emissions by reducing the shipping needed
03-04-2020T02:44:08,Dadrobit,"""I also work for pennies on the hour, work 24 hours of the day, and don't ask for time off."""

03-04-2020T02:46:07,Dadrobit,10 points to whoever gets the ref
03-04-2020T02:48:06,Dadrobit,"Damn, ain't none of ya Alien fans?"
03-04-2020T02:48:29,Dadrobit,RIP
03-04-2020T02:48:33,SageSaga,i am- ive just heard that in a lot of things and havent seen alien in like 8 years
03-04-2020T02:48:53,ZRO4825,I think I saw it once many many MANY years ago. :x
03-04-2020T02:49:00,SageSaga,ive heard that line used in anime too
03-04-2020T02:49:12,AspiringNoodle,"Dadro, I've watched so many anime I can't even remember all their names, lol"
03-04-2020T02:49:17,AspiringNoodle,Same goes for movies
03-04-2020T02:49:20,AspiringNoodle,And video games
03-04-2020T02:49:25,AspiringNoodle,And cartoons...
03-04-2020T02:49:41,SageSaga,i dont think that was all that memorable of a line really
03-04-2020T02:49:49,Dadrobit,Ya. It's the moment Ripley accesses Mother's database and finds the directive ordering Ashe to bring the organism back alive above all else.
03-04-2020T02:50:00,DarthRexKing,I got the reference. >W> Anyway ni ni.
03-04-2020T02:50:01,SageSaga,"its no- ""Get away from her you -female dog-!"""
03-04-2020T02:50:07,DarthRexKing,XD
03-04-2020T02:50:08,Dadrobit,"It's like, the moment of true horror in the film."
03-04-2020T02:50:20,Dadrobit,That's Aliens though.
03-04-2020T02:50:33,SageSaga,i know
03-04-2020T02:50:42,SageSaga,do you not like the series?
03-04-2020T02:50:54,SageSaga,i mean Alien was my favorite but 2 was great as well
03-04-2020T02:51:08,Dadrobit,Me? I love em. Saw em in theaters two years ago. Great experience.
03-04-2020T02:51:32,SageSaga,i never got to see them in theaters- but i own em
03-04-2020T02:51:41,Dadrobit,2001: A Space Odyssey is still my #1 though.
03-04-2020T02:51:55,Dadrobit,But Alien and Aliens is up there
03-04-2020T02:53:42,Dadrobit,Same theater that did/does the showings of animes that I mentioned earlier has a thing called Tuesday Night Classics. Older classics get shown for $7 every Tuesday.
03-04-2020T02:53:57,Dadrobit,Like Die Hard on Christmas Eve.
03-04-2020T02:54:08,Dadrobit,(Or whatever Tuesday is closest)
03-04-2020T02:54:34,SageSaga,i liked 2001 but- its not something i want to go back and watch- i do remember so much of it though
03-04-2020T02:56:34,Dadrobit,They had a showing in 2018 I got to see. They brought the original negatives from the filming out from storage and made new 70mm reels for the 50 year anniversary. It was so good.
03-04-2020T02:56:37,SageSaga,i did go to some shows at a theater that was doing stuff like that
03-04-2020T02:56:50,AspiringNoodle,Goin' to bed now
03-04-2020T02:56:54,Dadrobit,o/ Noodle
03-04-2020T02:56:56,SageSaga,"watched Back to the Future, Raiders of the Lost Ark-"
03-04-2020T02:56:58,AspiringNoodle,"Really enjoyed the chat, Dadro and Sage ;)"
03-04-2020T02:57:07,SageSaga,take care! sleep well!
03-04-2020T02:57:10,Dadrobit,"Yeah, exactly those fils"
03-04-2020T02:57:13,Dadrobit,films*
03-04-2020T02:57:36,AspiringNoodle,I must bolster my arguments for next time!
03-04-2020T02:58:08,AspiringNoodle,"Maybe if I sleep using an economics book as a pillow, I'll absorb the knowledge through osmosis :ptv-laugh:"
03-04-2020T02:58:08,SageSaga,good luck but you'll never win me over with isolationism XD
03-04-2020T02:58:14,Dadrobit,Unfortunately everything is closed down. They're not even bothering to advertise on the website anything for the foreseeable future.
03-04-2020T02:58:21,AspiringNoodle,"Also, eff isolationism"
03-04-2020T02:58:29,Dadrobit,Ooooorrrrr you'll just end up with a neck cramp?
03-04-2020T02:58:43,AspiringNoodle,"I want legitimate competition, but the ability to be self-sufficient in extreme circumstances"
03-04-2020T02:59:13,SageSaga,it almost always leads to isolationism if you do that
03-04-2020T02:59:49,SageSaga,but i do think as 3D printing tech gets better manufacturing is going to be kinda - a thing done in house XD
03-04-2020T03:00:06,AspiringNoodle,Pro-tip
03-04-2020T03:00:17,AspiringNoodle,Become the guy who makes the tools used to make other tools
03-04-2020T03:00:29,AspiringNoodle,Can't be replaced if you're the guy who makes machines that makes the machines ;P
03-04-2020T03:00:35,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-sleepy:
03-04-2020T03:00:58,SageSaga,a free internet is going to make all the difference there
03-04-2020T03:01:36,SageSaga,freely being able to share new improvements to 3D printing tech and new modifications is going to make the tech grow faster than an isolated network of people
03-04-2020T03:03:40,SageSaga,the last movie i watched was- the Tom Hanks movie about Mr Rodgers- a Beautiful day in the neigborhood
03-04-2020T03:05:21,Dadrobit,Obviously my last movie was Violet Evergarden from earlier today. Can't rightly recall what came before that though...
03-04-2020T03:06:37,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Arachnophobia for me, still oddly fun."
03-04-2020T03:08:08,ZRO4825,I started to watch Detective Pikachu earlier.
03-04-2020T03:08:17,ZRO4825,That's about all the further I made it with that.
03-04-2020T03:08:33,ZRO4825,I think that's the most movie I've watched in the last year though. :joy:
03-04-2020T03:10:59,Dadrobit,I almost wanna say it was John Wick 3 was my last movie
03-04-2020T03:11:00,SageSaga,i think when im done here im gonna watch the Konosuba movie\
03-04-2020T03:11:34,Dadrobit,"But that was so long ago, there had to be something inbetween"
03-04-2020T03:11:50,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Thanks for the streams Sage, nice work today"
03-04-2020T03:12:20,SageSaga,going to bed Marv?
03-04-2020T03:12:32,Dadrobit,Ohhhhhhh! Cats!
03-04-2020T03:12:49,Dadrobit,Phenomenal movie.
03-04-2020T03:13:00,SageSaga,wut
03-04-2020T03:13:18,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Already in bed.  I think I just mentally shut off there for a minute.  Thought you were done streaming.
03-04-2020T03:13:33,Dadrobit,I unironically quite liked it.
03-04-2020T03:13:34,SageSaga,nope- XD ive still got a few panels left
03-04-2020T03:14:42,Dadrobit,They did Rum Tum Tugger and Mr Mistoffelees dirty though
03-04-2020T03:15:26,Dadrobit,And Jennyanydots
03-04-2020T03:15:33,Dadrobit,didn't like her casting
03-04-2020T03:16:06,Dadrobit,"Rebel Wilson has one character for every movie, and she just doesn't fit there."
03-04-2020T03:16:53,SageSaga,hmm before Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood -- the last thing i watched was- Frozen 2
03-04-2020T03:18:02,Dadrobit,Huh. I remember a little hype for that movie. But it came and went with seemingly little affair?
03-04-2020T03:18:25,SageSaga,it was actually really good- but... The musical numbers were... weird
03-04-2020T03:18:43,Dadrobit,"I mean, it's kinda hard to live up to a song like ""Let It Go' getting played fucking everywhere for months on end. But I at least expected... something?"
03-04-2020T03:19:00,SageSaga,a lot of the music was great
03-04-2020T03:19:30,SageSaga,"but the visuals with it was- weird- and it was kinda like - for the most part not all ""Ok now its my turn to sing a song - everyone pay attention now!"""
03-04-2020T03:19:52,Dadrobit,"Ohhhhh, Aladdin remake had that syndrome in a bad way."
03-04-2020T03:20:20,SageSaga,i didnt see the remake- but the music in the original Aladdin seems to flow into it so naturally
03-04-2020T03:20:54,SageSaga,"it was like ""omg amazing magical or whimsical stuff is happening! Time for music!"""
03-04-2020T03:21:13,SageSaga,"but here its like ""STOP THE STORY! I must SING!"""
03-04-2020T03:21:35,Dadrobit,"It did well in some parts. Prince Ali entering the city was great. But then they went and gave Jasmine a song that literally jut stopped time and was like ""I'm gonna do a musical number now by myself!"""
03-04-2020T03:21:57,Dadrobit,just*
03-04-2020T03:22:09,Dadrobit,Literally killed the flow of the movie.
03-04-2020T03:23:03,SageSaga,killed it faster than luke entering the cave in empire strikes back?
03-04-2020T03:23:15,Dadrobit,D.
03-04-2020T03:23:17,Dadrobit,O.
03-04-2020T03:23:18,Dadrobit,A.
03-04-2020T03:24:03,SageSaga,"Empire is my favorite Star Wars movie and a great movie in general but- that scene really just - ""huuuuh?"""
03-04-2020T03:24:10,Dadrobit,"Also, it's just... a meh song about how she's a strong independent woman. Who is literally just being arrested."
03-04-2020T03:24:49,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I honestly even forgot that scene existed. Super outta place."
03-04-2020T03:25:14,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I heard the cave scene was to give a reason why Luke's face was jacked up because he got in a car wreck irk and needed reconstructive surgery
03-04-2020T03:25:35,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Irl*
03-04-2020T03:26:21,Dadrobit,"Nah, I think it's just a ""face your inner darkness"" moment"
03-04-2020T03:27:27,SageSaga,i thought the crash was between Empire being shot and ROTJ?
03-04-2020T03:27:31,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Wait which cave seen? Hoth or Dagoba?
03-04-2020T03:28:17,SageSaga,Dagobah
03-04-2020T03:28:20,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Oh
03-04-2020T03:28:30,Dadrobit,Dagobah  I thought. Where Vader is given Luke's face.
03-04-2020T03:28:45,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I was talking hoth
03-04-2020T03:29:23,SageSaga,oh- so the crash was between New Hope and Empire?
03-04-2020T03:30:18,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Think so, not sure only heard about it from a Chris stuckmann video on Empire"
03-04-2020T03:32:19,SageSaga,it looks like the rumors about how bad the crash was to his face was over exaggerated
03-04-2020T03:32:39,SageSaga,like some reports said that his nose was torn off
03-04-2020T03:33:04,SageSaga,but it wasnt - it did get pretty messed up but the surgery fixed it up with little to no scaring
03-04-2020T03:34:56,SageSaga,he was in another movie a couple months after the accident and minor make up was plenty to hide any signs
03-04-2020T03:36:21,SageSaga,yep the scene for the Wampa was also filmed a year after the accident too
03-04-2020T03:36:44,SageSaga,and Lucas himself said the scene was not written to cover up anything.
03-04-2020T03:36:57,SageSaga,Lucas just loves furry monsters :P
03-04-2020T03:37:11,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I feel lied to now ;-;
03-04-2020T03:37:28,SageSaga,it was a common story going around it seems
03-04-2020T03:37:50,SageSaga,enough that someone did a follow up report on it in 2017!
03-04-2020T03:42:07,SageSaga,probably dont need to correct this but it looks like the article is actually from 2015 with an update in 2017 just to make sure Disney is credited as the owner of Star Wars XD
03-04-2020T03:42:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Lmao
03-04-2020T03:42:41,Dadrobit,yikes
03-04-2020T03:45:02,SageSaga,"""Hey we like your work on this article- we'd like to have it on our big site"" ""Oh cool! sure!"" ""Hey so we just got a message from Disney- it says your images arent credited to Walt Disney Pictures-"" ""O_O I'll fix it!"""
03-04-2020T03:45:54,SageSaga,"""hoho! you'd better! Ho ho!"" ""Are we on a three way call"" ""O_O NO"" ""Hoho! Goodbye now!"""
03-04-2020T03:46:01,Dadrobit,pretty much lol
03-04-2020T03:48:14,SageSaga,Robit- do you watch John Oliver?
03-04-2020T03:48:51,Dadrobit,"No, can't say I do"
03-04-2020T03:49:04,SageSaga,darn
03-04-2020T03:49:16,Dadrobit,I've seen the odd clip of him. But I'm not a regular watcher no.
03-04-2020T03:50:05,SageSaga,all of his main stories are on youtube- but i highly recommend his video on Slapp suits
03-04-2020T03:50:21,SageSaga,the ending is just- magical
03-04-2020T03:52:11,Dadrobit,I'm mildly familiar with it from Devin Nune's attempt to issue a slapp against a digital cow
03-04-2020T03:53:52,Dadrobit,Opened it in another tab. Finishing some dinner atm. Will watch it after I'm through.
03-04-2020T04:02:45,ZRO4825,"Aight, I'm out for the mornin. Dozin off in my chair, lol. You guys have a good one. ^^/"
03-04-2020T04:03:12,SageSaga,take care Zro!
03-04-2020T04:05:56,Dadrobit,o/ ZRO
03-04-2020T04:06:01,Dadrobit,Watching the video now
03-04-2020T04:08:11,SageSaga,and im done with work!
03-04-2020T04:08:25,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nicely done sage
03-04-2020T04:08:34,SageSaga,i'll stick around here to hear what ya have to say about the video though XD
03-04-2020T04:11:34,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Thanks for the stream sage
03-04-2020T04:11:43,SageSaga,ty for joining ^^
03-04-2020T04:24:25,Dadrobit,Holy shit
03-04-2020T04:24:30,Dadrobit,That ending
03-04-2020T04:24:55,Dadrobit,The justices with the rainbow bloomer robes fucking killed me
03-04-2020T04:25:24,Dadrobit,"Also. Fuck anyone who participates in ""Legal gray area"" lawsuits."
03-04-2020T04:25:27,SageSaga,XD
03-04-2020T04:26:22,Dadrobit,"""See ya in court fuckface."" Jesus."
03-04-2020T04:26:33,SageSaga,"""He grabbed a fist full of m&ms!"""
03-04-2020T04:26:34,Dadrobit,it hurts to laugh.
03-04-2020T04:26:47,SageSaga,it was great right? XD
03-04-2020T04:27:27,Dadrobit,It was infuriating to watch. But the ending cooled me down just a little.
03-04-2020T04:28:53,Dadrobit,"Since I worked for myself for a while there, I've had a bit of experience in dealing with keeping a lawyer on retainer and it sucks to have to bring legal issues into play just because some fuckface doesn't want to pay me after I've supplied the work."
03-04-2020T04:29:20,Dadrobit,And then I have to look like the badguy because I had to go to legal means to get my pay.
03-04-2020T04:29:36,SageSaga,that's one thing i like an hate about Johns videos- they can make you really angry- and you look into it and - yeah its very accurate so that usually makes it a bit worse- but then he does something great at the end or leaves on a good note and im like
03-04-2020T04:29:48,SageSaga,"""Ok- it's just something we need to be mindful about and fix!"""
03-04-2020T04:30:11,Dadrobit,"Only had to do it three times, but every time the person(s) accused me of being lawsuit happy asshole. Nah mate, I just want the money you agreed to pay."
03-04-2020T04:31:29,Dadrobit,"Yeah, if he's consistently like this, then he's suddenly become a member of my high priority watch list."
03-04-2020T04:31:55,SageSaga,that was an especially good ending but most of his stories are that good
03-04-2020T04:32:07,SageSaga,or better-
03-04-2020T04:32:08,Dadrobit,I appreciate solid coverage of the topics that others are too timid to really dig into.
03-04-2020T04:32:22,SageSaga,tbh some of the topics they cover have even better stuff
03-04-2020T04:32:42,Dadrobit,"Yeah, lol. I can imagine he probably doesn't bring out the sequin clad dance team for every video. I'm cool with that."
03-04-2020T04:33:08,SageSaga,he does often end with something big and fin but not that long or that high budget
03-04-2020T04:33:14,SageSaga,fun* not fin
03-04-2020T04:33:29,Dadrobit,"He's popped up in my suggested watch list for a while and his topics have seemed interesting, just never took the time to watch any of them."
03-04-2020T04:35:28,Dadrobit,aaaaaand subscribed
03-04-2020T04:35:36,Dadrobit,Thanks kindly for the push my dude
03-04-2020T04:35:41,SageSaga,XD np
03-04-2020T04:35:49,SageSaga,take care! im gonna watch Konosuba now
03-04-2020T04:35:50,Dadrobit,And have a good night.
03-04-2020T04:36:01,Dadrobit,Enjoy! Heading to bed myself.

03-04-2020T12:29:52,funnyman42,Idk.
03-04-2020T13:03:59,Roughlandin,"No stream last night, Rainelover. Either Tom didn't want to spoil the next comic page or he just wasn't feeling it last night. Sometimes people just need a break. Sketch stream will be tomorrow at 4pm eastern, barring unforseen circumstances."

03-04-2020T13:33:30,Ordithus,"nothing ""set"" but lately he's usually updated sometime Saturday"
03-04-2020T13:34:43,ThoseButterflys,ok I was just checking Thank you

03-04-2020T14:01:07,BadFoMo,Yo.
03-04-2020T14:01:22,Ordithus,Hi!
03-04-2020T14:01:35,SageSaga,yo
03-04-2020T14:01:58,FoxxTrotter,:cfoxxtrotter-FoxEye:
03-04-2020T14:02:29,Grip,Hi :)
03-04-2020T14:03:01,SageSaga,man i wish i could have slept for an extra hour XD
03-04-2020T14:03:49,BadFoMo,I think I feel the same... And I did.
03-04-2020T14:03:58,BadFoMo,...I think.
03-04-2020T14:04:34,Ordithus,I've been waking up at 7:30 without fail since starting to work from home... no matter when I go to bed
03-04-2020T14:06:21,SageSaga,i got to bed around 8:40am
03-04-2020T14:06:33,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-floeyes:
03-04-2020T14:43:15,SpazztasticKiwi,people
03-04-2020T14:43:20,SageSaga,yo
03-04-2020T14:43:21,SpazztasticKiwi,are starting to steal
03-04-2020T14:43:26,SpazztasticKiwi,groceries
03-04-2020T14:43:27,SageSaga,wut
03-04-2020T14:43:30,SpazztasticKiwi,from carts
03-04-2020T14:43:46,Ordithus,"hi kiwi! people, am i right"
03-04-2020T14:44:14,SpazztasticKiwi,humans need to be canceled for the week until they can act right
03-04-2020T15:02:16,Grip,That really sucks.
03-04-2020T15:04:23,SageSaga,wow- the US has had almost a thousand people die to the virus today
03-04-2020T15:05:56,Ordithus,"wow, that's is awful"
03-04-2020T15:07:44,SageSaga,more than half were in new york and new jersey
03-04-2020T15:08:37,SageSaga,i think that means they are beyond normal capacity for their hospitals to handle so its going to keep going up as infection spreads
03-04-2020T15:08:57,Ordithus,like italy...
03-04-2020T15:09:11,SageSaga,yep
03-04-2020T15:10:23,SageSaga,last week our deaths per 1million population was 3
03-04-2020T15:10:28,SageSaga,no wait- it was 2
03-04-2020T15:10:41,SageSaga,it's now 25
03-04-2020T15:10:51,Ordithus,overall?
03-04-2020T15:11:46,SageSaga,thats the number of deaths divided by our population-
03-04-2020T15:12:23,SageSaga,for reference- though it might be incorrect since we know they are hiding information- China is still at a 2
03-04-2020T15:12:34,Ordithus,"yeah I get that, the question was whether that was from all causes"
03-04-2020T15:12:39,Ordithus,"seems to be ""yes"""
03-04-2020T15:13:08,Ordithus,cannot fathom how big an increase that is
03-04-2020T15:13:32,SageSaga,these are deaths from covid or complications from covid
03-04-2020T15:14:12,Ordithus,ah.
03-04-2020T15:14:15,SageSaga,we almost have 3x the number of people infected than Italy
03-04-2020T15:19:39,SageSaga,meanwhilte- people are telling nurses and doctors to suck it up and get back out there without protection...
03-04-2020T15:20:28,SageSaga,im starting to think comparing this whole thing to a war was a bad idea- Doctors and Nurses arent freakn soldiers
03-04-2020T15:21:34,Ordithus,"I get that, but what else is there to do?  People will still get sick regardless of PPE availability"
03-04-2020T15:22:28,SageSaga,i dont think thats any kinda excuse to tell people to risk their own lives
03-04-2020T15:23:39,CrRAR,“American spirit” raging against the “unseen enemy”
03-04-2020T15:23:46,CrRAR,What a strategy xD
03-04-2020T15:24:20,CrRAR,Virus don’t care
03-04-2020T15:24:51,Ordithus,It's weird to have a crisis where one of the best things to do is stay home
03-04-2020T15:25:29,CrRAR,yup
03-04-2020T15:26:24,SageSaga,the big thing nurses are complaining about is - some of them are being told to not wear masks because they dont have enough for everyone- so even if you have your own- they dont want you using it
03-04-2020T15:26:36,Ordithus,uh
03-04-2020T15:26:46,CrRAR,wow
03-04-2020T15:27:03,SageSaga,and these nurses have to go home and sleep after working for 13 hours - at home- with their young kids and compromised husbands/wives
03-04-2020T15:27:32,CrRAR,Yeah the level of spread those interactions cause is bad enough
03-04-2020T15:27:45,SageSaga,"so its like ""hey- you are likely to be infected- and then take it home to your family!"
03-04-2020T15:28:04,CrRAR,...because even when one gets sick you send in another healthy person to get sick
03-04-2020T15:28:09,SageSaga,"no soldier gets told ""hey- now that you are a soldier it's possible the enemy will go into your home and kill your kids"""
03-04-2020T15:28:53,SageSaga,how many people would sign up for the military if you told them that?
03-04-2020T15:29:13,CrRAR,Usually that’s WHO is insiring them to fight for
03-04-2020T15:29:44,CrRAR,"Yeah, doesn’t sound like a sustainable approach :c"
03-04-2020T15:29:49,SageSaga,lots of people are ok with dying for their family-- but no one is ok with having their family die because they wanted to protect them
03-04-2020T15:30:01,CrRAR,"Yeahhh, nope"
03-04-2020T15:30:05,SageSaga,its pretty much what we are doing to doctors and nurses right now
03-04-2020T15:30:09,sunblaze,hi everyone
03-04-2020T15:30:13,CrRAR,hi
03-04-2020T15:30:16,Ordithus,Hi sun
03-04-2020T15:30:17,SageSaga,yo Sunblaze
03-04-2020T15:30:37,SageSaga,got an idea for your commission this month Sunblaze? ^^
03-04-2020T15:30:56,sunblaze,probably something ester but no nothing specific yet
03-04-2020T15:31:20,SageSaga,"alright, let me know when ya do!"
03-04-2020T15:32:22,SageSaga,"we are losing a bunch of nurses and doctors because of this and people are treating them like ""military deserters"""
03-04-2020T15:34:09,CrRAR,"I feel like there should be no stigma, there have been plenty of plauges in history that nothing could be done for those who perished."
03-04-2020T15:34:20,CrRAR,We’re lucky we do have better healthcare than ever.
03-04-2020T15:34:40,SageSaga,and yet we all know it could be better
03-04-2020T15:34:50,CrRAR,"Oh, yeah, 100%"
03-04-2020T15:35:11,sunblaze,so they are dissing them for not sacrificing themselves in an instant? and actually thinkling of their own family first?
03-04-2020T15:35:19,SageSaga,yeah
03-04-2020T15:35:21,SageSaga,it's sick
03-04-2020T15:35:22,sunblaze,while everyone is sitting at home doing exactly that :(
03-04-2020T15:35:33,CrRAR,^^^
03-04-2020T15:35:36,SageSaga,they are treating medical workers like soldiers
03-04-2020T15:35:43,SageSaga,and that's bullcrap
03-04-2020T15:37:00,RimaDraws,hi sage!
03-04-2020T15:37:54,SageSaga,yo Rima
03-04-2020T15:38:42,Ordithus,Our best hope is brains and pasta https://xkcd.com/2287/
03-04-2020T15:38:58,Ordithus,And then ppe and ventilators
03-04-2020T15:40:36,RimaDraws,how is every one
03-04-2020T15:41:18,Ordithus,"alright, how're you?"
03-04-2020T15:41:32,CrRAR,"Yeah, huuuugggsss"
03-04-2020T15:42:28,Grip,"I am one of those medical workers, though I supply them with computers and tech."
03-04-2020T15:43:02,CrRAR,Send in the robots!
03-04-2020T15:43:22,Grip,We actually do have some at the hospital.
03-04-2020T15:43:24,SageSaga,"""you fool! dont you know the virus can last for days on metal?!"""
03-04-2020T15:43:35,Grip,XD
03-04-2020T15:43:58,Grip,"The robots are tablets on wheels, some one controls them around the hospital."
03-04-2020T15:44:07,Ordithus,we need robots made from alcohol
03-04-2020T15:44:34,Ordithus,"""Nyna! Stop drinking the robots!"""
03-04-2020T15:44:37,Ordithus,:csagesaga-nynastare:
03-04-2020T15:44:40,CrRAR,"Careful, they’re flammable."
03-04-2020T15:54:06,sunblaze,also Nyna knows that not all booze is good. reember the trollgrog :D
03-04-2020T15:54:17,sunblaze,:ptv-RainbowThrowup:
03-04-2020T15:56:00,SageSaga,i think i can say with certainty that Nyna would not be a fan of rubbing alcohol...
03-04-2020T15:56:13,Grip,That stuff stings!
03-04-2020T15:57:46,sunblaze,only with open wounds. if not it jsut smells and relaxes muscles
03-04-2020T15:59:00,SageSaga,ive never drank rubbing alcohol so i cant say how that feels but- i would assume it would not be good
03-04-2020T16:00:50,sunblaze,at least the stuff that is currently on the market in europe is changed to make it disgusting to dring.
03-04-2020T16:00:54,Ordithus,rubbing alcohol is a nono
03-04-2020T16:01:04,sunblaze,no clue about US-market. probably same
03-04-2020T16:02:37,Ordithus,US ethanol rubbing alcohol is denatured - it is especially poisonous
03-04-2020T16:02:47,Ordithus,"as in, more than the alcohol itself :P"
03-04-2020T16:06:34,Ordithus,I was not implying Nyna was drinking the toxic stuff
03-04-2020T16:08:04,SageSaga,did you not say she was drinking the robots?
03-04-2020T16:08:20,Ordithus,maybe they're made from the good stuff
03-04-2020T16:08:42,Ordithus,It was a joke!!! :ptv-uneasy:
03-04-2020T16:09:54,SageSaga,"*pat pat* is ok, like planes, not all jokes land"
03-04-2020T16:23:07,Rainelover,That Is wj
03-04-2020T16:23:21,SageSaga,what?
03-04-2020T16:23:30,Rainelover,*what r/woosh is for
03-04-2020T16:24:49,Rainelover,"Sorry, on mobile and the touchscreen doesn’t work well with my fat thumb in the case of typing"
03-04-2020T16:25:43,LannAF,eyyyooo
03-04-2020T16:26:06,SageSaga,yo Lann
03-04-2020T16:26:25,LannAF,yoo sage
03-04-2020T16:26:28,LannAF,I'm playing last oasis!
03-04-2020T16:26:33,Ordithus,o/ Lann
03-04-2020T16:26:54,SageSaga,cool
03-04-2020T16:28:14,LannAF,o/ Ordithus!
03-04-2020T16:28:34,LannAF,I wanna stream it for you :C
03-04-2020T16:29:05,SageSaga,well - im sure you noticed - im currently streaming and working-
03-04-2020T16:30:52,LannAF,indeed.
03-04-2020T16:31:00,LannAF,hence why I cannot do such a thing
03-04-2020T16:38:46,SageSaga,huh- this is neat- this stats page ive been using for info on the virus has a new stat- they are tracking testing
03-04-2020T16:44:27,LannAF,that is neat
03-04-2020T16:45:38,SageSaga,testing the the US now looks really high- but considering the population it's only decent
03-04-2020T16:47:10,SageSaga,it's vital we determine who all has the virus asap so they can be quarantined - and stop spreading. If we can get 99% we should be fine- but thats unlikely
03-04-2020T16:47:33,Grip,"Right, hopefully it can be done."
03-04-2020T16:49:27,SageSaga,the problem is we legit need 300 million tests to be done- even if you seem fine and have been in your home for 14 days-
03-04-2020T16:49:59,SageSaga,ive been at home for over 16 days- went out yesterday to get food and stuff- i could be infected now and not know it
03-04-2020T16:50:21,SageSaga,especially since pollen in the area right now is horrible- so im coughing and sneezing-
03-04-2020T16:50:41,Ordithus,Plague! :ptv-nope:*[Hiss]
03-04-2020T16:51:57,SageSaga,post nasal drip making it feel like ive got liquid in my lungs is enough to make me freak out already XD
03-04-2020T16:53:06,SageSaga,"but it's really scary because - i live with my parents and grand parents- all of them are over 60, my grand parents are in their 90's =_="
03-04-2020T16:57:43,sunblaze,any antihistamine avaivle?
03-04-2020T16:57:49,sunblaze,e.g. alergy suppresant
03-04-2020T16:58:06,SageSaga,yes- but they knock me out
03-04-2020T16:58:28,sunblaze,aww too bad
03-04-2020T16:58:57,SageSaga,im very susceptible to the antihistamine drowsiness side effect
03-04-2020T16:59:17,Ordithus,"even the ""non-drowsy"" ones, like claritin?"
03-04-2020T16:59:49,SageSaga,dont think they have been very effective for me
03-04-2020T17:00:23,SageSaga,could give it another shot though- but i dont have any soooo- would have to go to the store coughing and sneezing- they would love that
03-04-2020T17:03:58,sunblaze,darn tough luck :(
03-04-2020T17:06:30,SageSaga,might have to order it on amazon and see how long it will take to ship
03-04-2020T17:09:05,sunblaze,:thumbsup:
03-04-2020T17:09:12,SageSaga,ordered- but the shipping times is- well- yikes- might be here wednesday- might be here on the 29th =_=
03-04-2020T17:09:32,Ordithus,wow
03-04-2020T17:09:51,sunblaze,so basically they have no clue as well. great :P
03-04-2020T17:09:58,Ordithus,"I know they're having trouble, but wow"
03-04-2020T17:10:03,SageSaga,i have other things ordered so it will likely get thrown in with those and sent
03-04-2020T17:10:57,Ordithus,"Callum's cloak is pretty nice, btw.  Kinda want my own"
03-04-2020T17:13:54,SageSaga,Callum cant walk around with his high end gear on XD
03-04-2020T17:14:47,SageSaga,he hasnt transmogged a lot of his stuff- so his high end stuff is like - really crazy looking
03-04-2020T17:15:13,Ordithus,sounds tasteless
03-04-2020T17:15:15,SageSaga,he has a cloak of Stars for one thing and people looking at that would just freak out
03-04-2020T17:15:22,Ordithus,"oh boy, those are fun"
03-04-2020T17:15:56,Grip,Page is looking quite good
03-04-2020T17:16:01,SageSaga,especially when he casts a fire spell and suddenly one of the starts lights up and a flare shoots out of it
03-04-2020T17:16:12,SageSaga,ty Grip
03-04-2020T17:19:01,SageSaga,"i think the high end wizard armor would look pretty cool to kinda silly in terms of decorations - like the Astro Vestments that make illusions of falling stars, moons and planets circle around you"
03-04-2020T17:19:47,Ordithus,Might be cool in a game but hard to live with
03-04-2020T17:20:12,SageSaga,but then you have like the traditional Robes of the Archmage that are just like really decorative arcane symbol covered robes
03-04-2020T17:21:07,SageSaga,"meanwhile Kaylin has stuff like ""Web of the spider queen"" that is more or less a micro bikini with netting that covers her entire body"
03-04-2020T17:22:22,Ordithus,sounds very drow
03-04-2020T17:23:20,SageSaga,well yeah- dark elf!
03-04-2020T17:23:43,Ordithus,but could it be MORE drow?
03-04-2020T17:24:06,SageSaga,Kaylin did transmog her PvP gear but not to the level of her common gear that shes wearing now
03-04-2020T17:24:46,SageSaga,"Kaylins every day outfit is for adventuring, survival, utility"
03-04-2020T17:25:02,SageSaga,her PvP gear is speced for Stealth and Damage
03-04-2020T17:25:52,sunblaze,where does she keep her PVP gear then?
03-04-2020T17:26:00,SageSaga,it's a secret
03-04-2020T17:26:00,sunblaze,in those transdim. pockets as well?
03-04-2020T17:26:10,sunblaze,:ptv-condescending:
03-04-2020T17:26:18,Ordithus,"She's been wearing it the whole time, as underwear!"
03-04-2020T17:26:20,SageSaga,it will be in the comic eventually
03-04-2020T17:26:39,SageSaga,as a big reveal though im sure someone will figure it out eventually
03-04-2020T17:28:36,SageSaga,i have drawn her in an early version of her PVP gear already though
03-04-2020T17:28:47,Ordithus,linky?
03-04-2020T17:32:30,SageSaga,looking for it-
03-04-2020T17:32:36,RimaDraws,ugh sorry i dozed off. this looks great
03-04-2020T17:34:26,SageSaga,found it
03-04-2020T17:34:27,SageSaga,https://www.patreon.com/posts/february-2019-25033998
03-04-2020T17:34:57,Ordithus,:csagesaga-kaylinheart: nice
03-04-2020T17:40:22,SageSaga,only people who know the secret i think are Tom and Mihari so far- though i think i gave Purple a hint -
03-04-2020T17:42:35,sunblaze,that gear looks like a very direct thread to run away and scream like a little child. :P
03-04-2020T17:42:52,JojoF2415,Hi
03-04-2020T17:42:55,SageSaga,yo
03-04-2020T17:45:58,SageSaga,man i hope we get more than one stimulus check- ive had to spend a lot more money because of this virus than i expected- prices on things have gone up and ive needed to but groceries that werent on sale because- well they arent really doing sales <_<
03-04-2020T17:46:21,SageSaga,needed to buy*
03-04-2020T17:47:32,SageSaga,a huge part of my savings comes from careful shopping and only getting the best prices on my food when i can
03-04-2020T17:47:54,SageSaga,but ive had to pick up more food at the same time and not have any of it on sale
03-04-2020T17:49:11,Ordithus,has patreon been stable so far?
03-04-2020T17:49:52,SageSaga,it's dipped a bit but i expect it to dip more as time goes by
03-04-2020T17:50:51,SageSaga,tbh the commissions ive been getting lately are the only thing keeping me up- but i can only do so many commissions too
03-04-2020T17:51:40,SageSaga,last month i had a really good commission but the  work was sooooo much harder- it was a really big commission
03-04-2020T17:51:45,SageSaga,i should have charged more
03-04-2020T17:52:21,SageSaga,but i dont go back on what i say for a price- that would be wrong too
03-04-2020T17:53:08,SageSaga,"if something had changed - like ""oh i want to add another character"" then yeah- price changes- but nah- i knew pretty much everything when i took the job"
03-04-2020T17:53:20,SageSaga,but it was 3 characters and a dragon
03-04-2020T17:53:32,SageSaga,and i only charged 300 for it
03-04-2020T17:53:42,Ordithus,That's seems like a steal
03-04-2020T17:54:01,SageSaga,yeah- =_=
03-04-2020T17:54:50,Ordithus,any of these commisions public?
03-04-2020T17:54:54,SageSaga,i had a bunch of people drop to 1 dollar a month on Patreon though-so they are showing they want to support but just cant
03-04-2020T17:55:06,SageSaga,that one was for a book cover so its not public yet
03-04-2020T17:55:31,SageSaga,let me see if i can show any of the other ones though-
03-04-2020T17:55:50,Ordithus,"don't take too much time, I know you're working"
03-04-2020T17:58:01,SageSaga,here's one
03-04-2020T17:58:11,JojoF2415,I’ve been getting pretty good runs on deadlocked
03-04-2020T17:58:25,Ordithus,there's a story behind that one
03-04-2020T17:58:55,SageSaga,this is for a guy who is a writer- has a ton of books
03-04-2020T17:59:03,SageSaga,hes an amazing person
03-04-2020T17:59:06,sunblaze,thats a cool cover yeah
03-04-2020T17:59:18,SageSaga,he was the one that sent me all the money to buy the books for AI book 1
03-04-2020T17:59:30,Ordithus,woah
03-04-2020T17:59:39,SageSaga,when the kickstarter failed he sent me 4k
03-04-2020T17:59:46,sunblaze,:ptv-ohmy:
03-04-2020T18:00:12,SageSaga,and hes been commissioning me pretty much every month since- hes been a life saver
03-04-2020T18:00:42,SageSaga,i wont post any of his stuff though
03-04-2020T18:01:03,SageSaga,i think some of it is on his Patreon and stuff- and might be used in or on his books at some point
03-04-2020T18:02:42,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-adiracoin: business partners
03-04-2020T18:03:40,SageSaga,https://www.paypal.me/sage25 :P
03-04-2020T18:03:53,sunblaze,^so many missed donations :D
03-04-2020T18:04:21,SageSaga,i need to link that on my website
03-04-2020T18:04:40,Ordithus,:csagesaga-c4: how much to fully fund buttstream
03-04-2020T18:04:41,SageSaga,I think I'll ask Mihari to do that today
03-04-2020T18:05:24,SageSaga,i think I said 200 dollars for butt stream? XD - it wouldnt be long and it would mostly be kaylin and Nyna butts
03-04-2020T18:05:42,sunblaze,hmmm tempting
03-04-2020T18:06:03,SageSaga,it would be more fun to do with Maty though
03-04-2020T18:06:03,Grip,Would love Blue's and Nami's.
03-04-2020T18:06:35,SageSaga,well Nami's is on the Daki XD
03-04-2020T18:06:46,Grip,Ah! How about Blue?
03-04-2020T18:06:55,Ordithus,so are Nyna's and Kaylin's
03-04-2020T18:06:58,SageSaga,i could probably draw Blue's
03-04-2020T18:07:05,sunblaze,hugs kaylin daki :ptv-excited:
03-04-2020T18:07:23,Grip,Kitty butt is good butt.
03-04-2020T18:07:25,SageSaga,Nyna and Kaylin are just more adult/mature oriented characters
03-04-2020T18:07:44,Ordithus,"Yeah, but Blue is the biggest perv"
03-04-2020T18:07:56,sunblaze,indeed beefy elven abbs and kittybutts :D
03-04-2020T18:08:02,Ordithus,Call it fair play
03-04-2020T18:09:40,SageSaga,blue has her reasons for being a perv
03-04-2020T18:09:51,sunblaze,she needed reasons?
03-04-2020T18:10:32,SageSaga,"she's extremely open as a person from her history of being confined, its her way of showing the world she exists, and so shes just honest about her feelings and passions"
03-04-2020T18:11:00,sunblaze,interesting cool
03-04-2020T18:11:47,SageSaga,so she doesnt hide the fact that she wants to grope titties and smack butts
03-04-2020T18:12:09,Ordithus,she's just affectionate is all
03-04-2020T18:12:55,Grip,"Mhm, would love her own groped and smacked I bet, and her tail played with."
03-04-2020T18:13:21,Grip,Getting her ears nibbled on I bet would turn her to mush.
03-04-2020T18:14:09,SageSaga,of course- shes a bit of a nympho XD - but shes not into doing things that are unwanted. She teases Kate because she knows kate likes it but tries to never take it too far
03-04-2020T18:14:44,SageSaga,its why occasionally blue and Kate will go in sync with each other
03-04-2020T18:14:44,Grip,"Right, just enough to be playful."
03-04-2020T18:15:26,SageSaga,Kate's even admitted to being bi
03-04-2020T18:16:57,SageSaga,actually she did that pretty recently didnt she?
03-04-2020T18:17:14,Ordithus,within the past year or so I think
03-04-2020T18:17:22,Grip,"Can have some fun with Phil and Blue at the same time, if she does want to do that."
03-04-2020T18:17:53,SageSaga,but she also knows Blue's history so shes exceedingly forgiving with her and sometimes very strict with her
03-04-2020T18:18:25,SageSaga,hmmm- not so much Grip XD
03-04-2020T18:19:21,Ordithus,They've got their Phil and Nami
03-04-2020T18:19:53,Grip,Right.
03-04-2020T18:20:41,SageSaga,if yosh were a porn i wouldnt have a problem with them being poly- but it's not- so they arent XD
03-04-2020T18:21:21,Grip,"Yep, is fun when Blue plays with Kate and possibly Nami when she gets her tail and ears on."
03-04-2020T18:22:06,SageSaga,comic is done!
03-04-2020T18:22:19,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Very well done Sage \o/
