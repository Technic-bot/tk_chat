14-04-2020T00:03:24,SpazztasticKiwi,a couple found a 2 year old with his little trike on the highway
14-04-2020T00:03:30,SpazztasticKiwi,two lanes over
14-04-2020T00:03:41,BlackjackSec99,??????
14-04-2020T00:03:42,SpazztasticKiwi,going against traffic
14-04-2020T00:03:52,BlackjackSec99,"wait, really? actual news story?"
14-04-2020T00:04:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"boy had gotten away from mom, out of the house, out of the neighborhood gate, across two lanes of interstate traffic, and was just petaling along"
14-04-2020T00:05:03,SpazztasticKiwi,it was in early March
14-04-2020T00:05:53,BlackjackSec99,ohhhhh wow
14-04-2020T00:06:13,SpazztasticKiwi,the walked him over to said neighborhood and started door to door looking for his adult figures
14-04-2020T00:06:39,SpazztasticKiwi,a woman went running by everyone as they were at the first few houses looking for her son
14-04-2020T00:06:55,SpazztasticKiwi,she says he ‚Äúgot away from her‚Äù
14-04-2020T00:07:43,SpazztasticKiwi,all the pulled over cars on the interstate apparently got her attention and she noticed he was missing
14-04-2020T00:07:53,BlackjackSec99,"ok, 2  year olds dont really travel all that fast... how long was she not paying attention to him?"
14-04-2020T00:08:17,BlackjackSec99,geez.... thats scary
14-04-2020T00:08:49,SpazztasticKiwi,the couple that found him has the dashcam video of coming up on him
14-04-2020T00:09:34,SpazztasticKiwi,he‚Äôs just this iiiiitty bitty black dot until you‚Äôre right up on him - i.e. impact distance
14-04-2020T00:11:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"alright I found it and the video is posted January, not March"
14-04-2020T00:11:17,SpazztasticKiwi,it was shared by someone else in March
14-04-2020T00:11:18,BlackjackSec99,"yeah, in vegas, watching it now"
14-04-2020T00:11:33,SpazztasticKiwi,boulder highway?

14-04-2020T00:12:37,BlackjackSec99,"yup. man, thats a busy road too"
14-04-2020T00:15:13,SpazztasticKiwi,funny how they point out the loose gate was the biggest problem
14-04-2020T00:15:30,SpazztasticKiwi,how about the lady don‚Äôt lose sight of the baby
14-04-2020T00:15:49,BlackjackSec99,right?

14-04-2020T00:16:07,BlackjackSec99,thats NOT safe
14-04-2020T00:16:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I wanna know what was so distracting for her to lose him in enough time to cross two lanes of traffic after leaving a whole neighborhood
14-04-2020T00:21:17,Dadrobit,"Dang, looks like I missed some streamin'."

14-04-2020T00:23:03,Dadrobit,"But I went to the doc to get an all clear, but the doctor refused."

14-04-2020T00:23:49,BlackjackSec99,risk factors for relapse?
14-04-2020T00:23:54,Dadrobit,"""If you go back to work and get reinfected, you're as good as dead."""
14-04-2020T00:24:06,BlackjackSec99,oh....

14-04-2020T00:26:12,Dadrobit,"I have a couple grand saved up, and my rent is frozen for the time being, so I'm not in dire straights or anything."
14-04-2020T00:26:20,Dadrobit,Still. Shit blows.
14-04-2020T00:26:26,SpazztasticKiwi,I also watched a lady play a hide and seek game with her husky
14-04-2020T00:27:20,BlackjackSec99,"file for disability early. takes time for it to process, but if you cant work any time soon because of medical, youll need it"
14-04-2020T00:33:35,SpazztasticKiwi,anyone seen the newest diy face mask?
14-04-2020T00:37:42,Dadrobit,My doctor recieved my work's FMLA paperwork earlier today. So I'm just waiting on that.

14-04-2020T01:10:52,AspiringNoodle,"Also, kinda knocking out some youtube vids, so I guess there's that?"

14-04-2020T01:34:10,SpazztasticKiwi,"it‚Äôs in the south, it could be just flat out built on a gravesite"
14-04-2020T01:34:16,BlackjackSec99,thats realllly cheap...
14-04-2020T01:34:17,BlackjackSec99,oh
14-04-2020T01:34:28,BlackjackSec99,the south? yeah homes are just plain cheap there
14-04-2020T01:35:04,BlackjackSec99,Im used to CA where stuff STARTS at 180k for a 2 bedroom on 1/4 acre in inexpensive towns
14-04-2020T01:39:34,SpazztasticKiwi,there‚Äôs plenty of cheap homes but they‚Äôre not good
14-04-2020T01:40:13,SpazztasticKiwi,they‚Äôre all family size & all I want is for me and the cats
14-04-2020T01:40:32,SpazztasticKiwi,two three bed tops

14-04-2020T01:41:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I have my own bathroom now - nobody needs to be going through my stuff and using it

14-04-2020T01:50:23,SpazztasticKiwi,is it an atrocity that I put parmesan in my teriyaki stir fry noodles
14-04-2020T01:57:20,SpazztasticKiwi,I can‚Äôt say I regret it
14-04-2020T01:57:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"oh but speaking of houses, I‚Äôm asking my aunt if I can rent like she is in the neighborhood she‚Äôs moving in to"
14-04-2020T01:58:46,SpazztasticKiwi,"her landlord is a friend of her moms and if she‚Äôs renting to own and she‚Äôs got another place that I can have, I can live down the street from my dads two sisters!"
14-04-2020T02:27:59,SpazztasticKiwi,"also, teens are now trying to swallow spoons of nutmeg"

14-04-2020T12:30:13,CrimsonQuill,Oh dammit
14-04-2020T12:30:19,CrimsonQuill,I keep mixing them up
14-04-2020T12:30:20,CrimsonQuill,Sorry
14-04-2020T12:30:45,ThingsAreMoving,No worries
14-04-2020T12:31:07,CrimsonQuill,aheheh
14-04-2020T12:31:25,CrimsonQuill,"I finally caught up to the current pages, and I am INCREDIBLY apprehensive."
14-04-2020T12:31:52,ThingsAreMoving,How come?
14-04-2020T12:32:16,CrimsonQuill,"I have a feeling that after letting us connect with everyone, Tom's going to remind us just how dark the world of Twokinds-and Trace's past-are."
14-04-2020T12:32:21,CrimsonQuill,With death.
14-04-2020T12:33:00,CrimsonQuill,"Seriously, whatever Reni is snarling at, and whatever that...THING...in the room on the corridor is, Trace will be screaming in agony as his mind rips himself apart."
14-04-2020T12:33:22,ThingsAreMoving,Reni snarling?
14-04-2020T12:33:39,CrimsonQuill,On the cover of chapter 20
14-04-2020T12:33:40,CrimsonQuill,21
14-04-2020T12:33:43,CrimsonQuill,Sorry
14-04-2020T12:33:46,ThingsAreMoving,ooooh on the cover
14-04-2020T12:33:48,CrimsonQuill,"CHapter 21, not 20"
14-04-2020T12:34:15,CrimsonQuill,"I am very worried, and don't want anyone hurt, but at the same time know that someone'll probably end up dead."
14-04-2020T12:34:40,CrimsonQuill,"Not to mention Adira being taken, and Clovis and Co. outside the manor, as well as Brahn and his ilk."
14-04-2020T12:35:09,ThingsAreMoving,Yeah I feel like we have too many characters running around now. I feel like it's impeding the storytelling process
14-04-2020T12:35:22,CrimsonQuill,...
14-04-2020T12:35:28,CrimsonQuill,I just like 'em all...
14-04-2020T12:35:39,CrimsonQuill,But I know at heart that someone's going to die.
14-04-2020T12:35:45,CrimsonQuill,And I'm afraid who it'll be.
14-04-2020T12:36:46,ThingsAreMoving,"There might not be any killing involved, we'll have to wait and see."
14-04-2020T12:36:53,CrimsonQuill,We will.
14-04-2020T12:37:09,CrimsonQuill,I get serious Red vs Blue vibes from what Trace was trying to do
14-04-2020T12:37:23,CrimsonQuill,(If you haven't watched it I won't spoil)
14-04-2020T12:37:38,ThingsAreMoving,I'm only hoping at some point Clovis will get that high five
14-04-2020T12:37:40,ThingsAreMoving,with a brick
14-04-2020T12:37:42,ThingsAreMoving,to the face
14-04-2020T12:38:18,ThingsAreMoving,Never watched RvB
14-04-2020T12:38:24,CrimsonQuill,Okay
14-04-2020T12:38:29,CrimsonQuill,I won't spoil then
14-04-2020T12:38:31,CrimsonQuill,Sorry#
14-04-2020T12:38:33,ThingsAreMoving,"huh, it's been going on since 2003?"
14-04-2020T12:38:43,ThingsAreMoving,I don't care about spoilers
14-04-2020T12:38:52,ThingsAreMoving,but I might not get any references
14-04-2020T12:39:27,CrimsonQuill,"Well... it's all on youtube, the first 13 seasons are the best"
14-04-2020T12:39:58,CrimsonQuill,Welll...seasons 1-5 start stuff out
14-04-2020T12:40:01,ThingsAreMoving,"how many episodes per season, and how long are they usually?"
14-04-2020T12:40:08,CrimsonQuill,6-13 are storytelling best
14-04-2020T12:40:17,ThingsAreMoving,might binge watch if they're short
14-04-2020T12:40:21,CrimsonQuill,Each season has maybe 20 episodes at 5 mins each
14-04-2020T12:40:31,CrimsonQuill,A season could be binged in two hours at most
14-04-2020T12:40:38,CrimsonQuill,They're almost movies
14-04-2020T12:40:48,CrimsonQuill,I have a DVD boxset shipping from Amazon
14-04-2020T12:41:03,ThingsAreMoving,"so, three days binge watching"
14-04-2020T12:41:04,CrimsonQuill,But you'll find someone very similar to Trace in method...
14-04-2020T12:41:20,CrimsonQuill,@ThingsAreMoving You aren't actually gonna binge it in 3 days are you?
14-04-2020T12:41:28,CrimsonQuill,Maybe spread it out?
14-04-2020T12:41:30,ThingsAreMoving,I might
14-04-2020T12:41:30,CrimsonQuill,It is good
14-04-2020T12:41:33,CrimsonQuill,Oh crumbs
14-04-2020T12:41:34,CrimsonQuill,Ahehehe
14-04-2020T12:41:41,CrimsonQuill,I love Halo (off which it is based)
14-04-2020T12:41:54,ThingsAreMoving,"I've noticed, lol"
14-04-2020T12:42:14,ThingsAreMoving,Having a passion is good.
14-04-2020T12:42:17,CrimsonQuill,"But the RvB stories (especially -S6-13) are on par with, and sometimes better than, some of Halo's narratives"
14-04-2020T12:42:21,CrimsonQuill,Heck
14-04-2020T12:42:47,CrimsonQuill,When Halo Raine was posted someone made a funny dialogue thing where some TK characters meet the Reds and Blues
14-04-2020T12:43:00,CrimsonQuill,"And now, a year later, I've mocked up a comic of it"
14-04-2020T12:43:16,CrimsonQuill,Caboose giving Kathrin pets because he finds her fluffy XD
14-04-2020T12:43:53,CrimsonQuill,@ThingsAreMoving is it okay if I whisper one quick (non spoiler) clip that pretty much sums up the series?
14-04-2020T12:44:12,ThingsAreMoving,"yeah, go for it"

14-04-2020T20:57:43,BlackjackSec99,I would do only 1 thing.
14-04-2020T20:57:58,BlackjackSec99,"tail tug works on everyone, humans included."
14-04-2020T20:58:23,K3IDRAN,O_O um.. i I'm good
14-04-2020T21:02:25,K3IDRAN,Wait how does tail tug evenwork on humans? By tugging ontheir Tail bones?
14-04-2020T21:03:45,BlackjackSec99,"Imaginary for the first tug. go up behind human, grab where you think their tail would be, given current mood, and tug, if not correct, nothing happens, if correct, they swap gender and permanently gain a tail."
14-04-2020T21:04:40,BlackjackSec99,"Karen would be excited at this prospect, me thinks"
14-04-2020T21:05:20,SpazztasticKiwi,so a tail is like a lamp switch
14-04-2020T21:05:46,BlackjackSec99,"As Kat found out, pretty much"
14-04-2020T21:06:15,K3IDRAN,Tbh Tk Vr dhould have Tail tug
14-04-2020T21:06:42,BlackjackSec99,"I think its got to be a specific tug though... like a certain strength and duration, in a certain direction, with the mental idea of a switch behind the tug"
14-04-2020T21:06:47,SpazztasticKiwi,can you imagine how bad teen boys would be if they could turn their friends into girls by pulling a tail
14-04-2020T21:06:53,BlackjackSec99,.........
14-04-2020T21:06:55,K3IDRAN,Omg

14-04-2020T21:07:19,SpazztasticKiwi,there‚Äôs already atrocities like nut ball
14-04-2020T21:07:38,BlackjackSec99,It was interesting enough without the gender change possibilities
14-04-2020T21:07:54,SpazztasticKiwi,"and yeah, Tom‚Äôs been scarce lately"
14-04-2020T21:08:06,BlackjackSec99,working to catch up maybe?
14-04-2020T21:08:13,SpazztasticKiwi,that‚Äôs my guess
14-04-2020T21:09:10,SpazztasticKiwi,"he missed a stream one Friday I remember cause I‚Äôd gotten off later than I was supposed to, would‚Äôve been late to the stream anyhow but eh"
14-04-2020T21:10:22,K3IDRAN,True
14-04-2020T21:10:33,SpazztasticKiwi,that‚Äôs the night about six of who was on seemed to think I was obsessed so I decided I would be occupying myself with other things if work wasn‚Äôt taking my time
14-04-2020T21:10:57,SpazztasticKiwi,"lay off whenever someone‚Äôs streaming, kinda thing"
14-04-2020T21:11:27,SpazztasticKiwi,"then he missed another because he was still behind, then there was the power outage..."
14-04-2020T21:11:54,BlackjackSec99,"he also has the reprints and 5th book coming out too, which probably wouldnt be streamable for the majority of it."
14-04-2020T21:12:23,SpazztasticKiwi,yeah he announced his working on that before fate decided ‚Äúyou know what - new plan‚Äù
14-04-2020T21:12:53,BlackjackSec99,"*earth hits big red button labled ""pause*"
14-04-2020T21:13:49,K3IDRAN,Tbh  a tk video games should have an Achievement called ''Freedom'' and to get this achievement Is to rid Mekkan of Templar Influence like Destroy all the Templar towers  kill all of the masters etc
14-04-2020T21:13:58,K3IDRAN,*play*
14-04-2020T21:15:04,BlackjackSec99,"eh, honestly, even if he missed the stream due to simply needing a break, thats cool too. I mean, he does a LOT of art pretty often, and weekly comic updates have to be pretty challenging to do after 17 years."
14-04-2020T21:15:39,AspiringNoodle,"Oy, guys, wanna hear a joke?"

14-04-2020T23:31:54,SpazztasticKiwi,cashier shared she had a lady at some time ring up ~$70/80 of stuff and pulled out a $20 like ‚Äúdo you think the store could help me out with the rest‚Äù
14-04-2020T23:41:13,Dadrobit,"Been there, done that."
14-04-2020T23:41:59,Dadrobit,"Albertson's policy was: Well, the store can't help you, but if the cashier wants to foot the bill, that's their choice."
14-04-2020T23:42:13,Dadrobit,Fukkin' sucked.
14-04-2020T23:43:02,Dadrobit,Pressure from management and the customers in the know to pay for other peoples' foodstuffs while barely taking in more than minimum wage ourselves..
14-04-2020T23:43:41,Dadrobit,Stemmed from the issue that cashiers had vastly different payscales.
14-04-2020T23:44:36,Dadrobit,"Older cashiers from previous contracts had no glass cielings and made $25+ an hour. But anyone hired more recently made effectively minimum wage, up to $111.50."
14-04-2020T23:44:41,Dadrobit,$11.50*
14-04-2020T23:45:24,Dadrobit,"So the better paid cashiers had no problem with chipping in for their customers, but the rest of up financially just couldn't."
14-04-2020T23:45:57,Dadrobit,"Leading to customers getting upset, ""What do you mean you can't? Matt helps me all the time!"""
14-04-2020T23:46:17,Dadrobit,"Well lady, Matt makes more than twice as much as I do. Sorry bout that I guess."
14-04-2020T23:50:07,SpazztasticKiwi,we have someone like that
14-04-2020T23:50:13,SpazztasticKiwi,overly helps people
14-04-2020T23:50:34,SpazztasticKiwi,and then that conditions entitled customers to be more entitled
14-04-2020T23:50:47,AspiringNoodle,"Proper response: ""I'm sorry sir / ma'am, charity must be given not taken.  One must secure one's self in order to effectively help others."""
14-04-2020T23:51:08,SpazztasticKiwi,one woman has us literally weight every rotisserie chicken we have at the moment she arrives to get the biggest

14-04-2020T23:51:56,SpazztasticKiwi,he spoils customers and it got to a point we‚Äôd get customers calling our department asking for him to ask for something
14-04-2020T23:52:26,AspiringNoodle,I've helped customers out on occassion
14-04-2020T23:52:47,AspiringNoodle,Usually they're some poor soul who are trying to get somewhere and they've run out of gas and have very little money.
14-04-2020T23:53:20,Dadrobit,"Honestly, I ended up giving away a ton of free shit myself."
14-04-2020T23:53:51,Dadrobit,"Either I did it, or they complained, got a manager, got me in minor trouble, and then they get the free shit anyways."
14-04-2020T23:54:17,AspiringNoodle,The worst off soul I met literally ran out of gas as he drove into the parking lot
14-04-2020T23:54:31,Dadrobit,"Minor crap like a steak ringing up for a penny? Fuck it mate, enjoy your penny steak."
14-04-2020T23:55:06,SpazztasticKiwi,"I‚Äôve given extras to people but it‚Äôs usually because we‚Äôre out of one thing or another, they‚Äôve been unbelievably nice about having to wait for the single worker to get to them, or maybe because they‚Äôve been polite"
14-04-2020T23:55:13,Dadrobit,"But catching people swapping barcodes so that $150 roasts ring up for $5. Nah, fuck off."
14-04-2020T23:55:38,SpazztasticKiwi,people are seen doing that kind of thing in self checkout all the time
14-04-2020T23:55:53,Dadrobit,Had one family in particular that tried it fucking constantly.
14-04-2020T23:56:18,Dadrobit,"""Oh! How could that barcode have possibly been swapped out like that??? Such a mystery!"
14-04-2020T23:56:39,AspiringNoodle,People have been interviewed on the subject
14-04-2020T23:56:42,AspiringNoodle,Some do it for the thrill
14-04-2020T23:57:02,AspiringNoodle,Some do it chronically for small items every now and then
14-04-2020T23:57:03,Dadrobit,Also caught them shuffling entire areas of the shelves so that things are improperly labeled/priced.
14-04-2020T23:57:05,SpazztasticKiwi,much like the mystery as to how their brain got swapped out with flat air
14-04-2020T23:57:14,AspiringNoodle,And then there are the entitled assholes
14-04-2020T23:57:39,AspiringNoodle,"The people who reason that ""the store is making ME work.  That's THEIR job and FUCK THEM if they think they're gonna make me do THEIR job."""
14-04-2020T23:57:50,AspiringNoodle,"""So FUCK THEM, I'm not paying for all this shit."""
14-04-2020T23:58:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"plenty do it around here cause if the amount is small enough, security won‚Äôt persecute"
14-04-2020T23:58:16,Dadrobit,Legit. I was helping another customer fill out her WIC and saw the father one by one moving the 25 pound bags of rice over to the 5 pound area.
14-04-2020T23:59:24,Dadrobit,"Then when the 25 lb bags he tried to buy rang up as ""too much"" he tried to bring me back to ""show me"" how all the 25lb bags were in the ""wrong"" area."
