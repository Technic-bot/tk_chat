29-05-2020T01:20:10,JojoGD,I just like how pokemon from GO and be transferred to let’s go
29-05-2020T01:20:58,SageSaga,random- but yes- unfortunately not all of them tohugh
29-05-2020T01:21:01,SageSaga,though*
29-05-2020T01:21:37,JojoGD,I know but is makes filling up the Pokédex way easier
29-05-2020T01:22:35,SageSaga,i already filled my pokemon Home pokedex
29-05-2020T01:22:48,JojoGD,Especially with trade evolutions
29-05-2020T01:24:04,JojoGD,Im working on a live pc dex on both let’s go and swsh
29-05-2020T01:25:01,SageSaga,home is the ultimate live dex
29-05-2020T01:25:18,JojoGD,I don’t have home
29-05-2020T01:25:32,SageSaga,you should fix that
29-05-2020T01:25:54,JojoGD,I also plan live dexing heartgold
29-05-2020T01:26:30,SageSaga,but if you just do a home dex- you have all of them...
29-05-2020T01:27:16,JojoGD,I want to have live dex on multiple games
29-05-2020T01:27:59,SageSaga,but then they wont be live for long-
29-05-2020T01:28:43,JojoGD,One thing I didn’t like about let’s go is that the beginning got really nerfed
29-05-2020T01:29:08,AspiringNoodle,So excited for tomorrow~
29-05-2020T01:29:33,SageSaga,whats happening tomorrow Noodle?
29-05-2020T01:29:46,JojoGD,Tell us
29-05-2020T01:29:55,AspiringNoodle,I have the day off
29-05-2020T01:30:00,JojoGD,Nice
29-05-2020T01:30:06,AspiringNoodle,I look forward to seeing a Saturday Sage strem :ptv-excited:
29-05-2020T01:30:12,AspiringNoodle,"And unlike tonight, I don't plan to lurk~"
29-05-2020T01:31:36,SageSaga,saturday streams can be pretty quick - last week i fully colored the comic in like 2 hours?
29-05-2020T01:31:53,AspiringNoodle,All the more reason to not lurk <3
29-05-2020T01:32:50,JojoGD,Pokemon let’s go is the 3rd game I get an early full odds shiny
29-05-2020T01:36:24,JojoGD,After beating let’s go eevee. It is road to 9 circles
29-05-2020T01:36:35,Twokinds,:crayon:
29-05-2020T01:36:53,JojoGD,Hi tom
29-05-2020T01:41:34,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nyna looking cute her Sage
29-05-2020T01:44:01,SageSaga,ty Marv
29-05-2020T01:55:44,Ordithus,:csagesaga-c3:
29-05-2020T01:59:18,Twokinds,Man news is crazy.
29-05-2020T01:59:28,Ordithus,tell me about it
29-05-2020T01:59:47,SageSaga,which part?
29-05-2020T02:00:39,Twokinds,"Did you hear about the CNN center? I was like... I know that place, we were there!"
29-05-2020T02:00:58,SageSaga,yeah- though im not sure why its being attacked
29-05-2020T02:01:24,Twokinds,No clue.
29-05-2020T02:02:12,SageSaga,i get the general anger though- im pretty pissed off too
29-05-2020T02:05:12,SageSaga,ok the CNN center thing is another protest - you get a bunch of people together angry and they start focusing that anger on whatever they can
29-05-2020T02:06:04,AspiringNoodle,"Wait, why is CNN being attacked?  They genuinely make me laugh!"
29-05-2020T02:06:09,Twokinds,Almost feels like it was inevitable. This year's been headed to a boil. A lot of people on edge.
29-05-2020T02:06:37,SageSaga,yeah and watching a cop murder a man on the street put me over the edge
29-05-2020T02:06:53,AspiringNoodle,"Yeeeeeh, he goin' to prison :|"
29-05-2020T02:07:12,SageSaga,the other cop should too
29-05-2020T02:07:15,SageSaga,he did nothing
29-05-2020T02:07:34,MarvTheHugPharaoh,He's under investigation and I'm pretty sure it's over for him
29-05-2020T02:07:40,Ordithus,3 more
29-05-2020T02:08:03,SageSaga,yeah there were 3 others- but i didnt see the other 2 what they were doing
29-05-2020T02:08:03,Ordithus,there were 4 involved in total
29-05-2020T02:08:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,The main guy got charged with 3rd degree murder and could be facing life
29-05-2020T02:08:19,Ordithus,I haven't had the heart to watch it
29-05-2020T02:08:24,SageSaga,not a single one tried to do anything though
29-05-2020T02:08:30,SageSaga,i watched it- kinda wish i hadnt
29-05-2020T02:08:35,SageSaga,its heartbreaking
29-05-2020T02:08:47,SageSaga,and i totally get why people are burning places to the ground over it
29-05-2020T02:08:59,Twokinds,"I didn't watch it. I don't like seeing that stuff, don't like getting mad."
29-05-2020T02:09:17,Ordithus,"I get the rage, I agree with the rage.  I hate seeing a city I lived in burn"
29-05-2020T02:09:27,AspiringNoodle,"In all honesty, our police system needs a complete overhaul in things like training, accountability, etc."
29-05-2020T02:09:33,Ordithus,"It just sucks all around, so much"
29-05-2020T02:09:39,AspiringNoodle,And the BIGGEST problem of all that needs killed off is tribalism :/
29-05-2020T02:09:48,Twokinds,Yeah. This year. everything sucks
29-05-2020T02:09:51,AspiringNoodle,"The ""we protect our own"" mentality is the biggest enabler of corruption >_>"
29-05-2020T02:10:10,SageSaga,i watched it not knowing i was going to watch the life drain from a man while 1 cop stared at people begging him to stop with no emotion
29-05-2020T02:13:52,SageSaga,there were so many people there begging for them to stop - even a fire department worker was asking them to stop and check his vitals- but they refused and only stopped when the ambulance arrived and they loaded his corpse onto a stretcher - it was sick
29-05-2020T02:14:24,AspiringNoodle,That right there is the *biggest* thing that arguably needs changed with the whole system
29-05-2020T02:14:26,SageSaga,and I get rioting isnt a good thing either but they are right to be angry
29-05-2020T02:15:06,AspiringNoodle,"As it stands, cops can basically act with impunity, even going so far as to commit crimes, but the law protects them until after the fact"
29-05-2020T02:15:22,AspiringNoodle,"And if you try to stop them, then *you're* breaking the law"
29-05-2020T02:16:40,AspiringNoodle,And I get the feeling that the only way this broken system will be mended is when a cop goes so far over the line that it won't end with rioting
29-05-2020T02:16:46,Twokinds,It really feels like it's near impossible to get justice from a bad cop. They always get away with it.
29-05-2020T02:16:48,AspiringNoodle,It'll end with a public lynching of the offending officer[s]
29-05-2020T02:17:07,SageSaga,doesnt help that police are also firing pepper bullets at the press too now
29-05-2020T02:17:45,AspiringNoodle,I guess all-out civil war would do it too...
29-05-2020T02:17:47,SageSaga,how the heck does a police man in a well lit area fire at a live reporter and the camera man?
29-05-2020T02:18:16,SageSaga,this is why superman was a Journalist and not a freakn cop
29-05-2020T02:19:25,AspiringNoodle,"What's worse is, I can guarantee this is going to prompt targeted cop killings in other areas of the country with officers who have zero to do with the whole incident"
29-05-2020T02:20:02,AspiringNoodle,And that at least 1 of those officers is going to turn out to be one of the ones who genuinely attempted to improve the community
29-05-2020T02:20:08,SageSaga,probably
29-05-2020T02:20:47,AspiringNoodle,And that kids is why it's a good thing super powers don't exist
29-05-2020T02:20:57,AspiringNoodle,"Because you'd have individuals acting as judge, jury, and executioner"
29-05-2020T02:21:25,Ordithus,that's what the problem is - that just happened.  and keeps happening
29-05-2020T02:24:01,Ordithus,never thought I'd be listening to press conferences pretty much daily
29-05-2020T02:24:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"In lighter news.  A man named Kb Balla, is a firefighter currently helping put out the fire the rioters started.  Well he also wanted to own a sports bra and was about to do its grand opening before all this happened."
29-05-2020T02:24:42,Ordithus,he wanted a sports bra?
29-05-2020T02:24:45,Ordithus,You can buy those
29-05-2020T02:24:48,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Bar
29-05-2020T02:24:51,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-florajiggle:
29-05-2020T02:25:00,Ordithus,good typo
29-05-2020T02:26:07,SageSaga,"i do like the comparisons to protesters holding up signs saying they want a hair cut vs now ""am i going to die next?"""
29-05-2020T02:26:17,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"But the rioters looted and burnt it down before he could.  When this news hit peoples ears a go fund me started up.  $100,000 to go straight into his pocket to help him rebuild.  It made over $400,000.  All going to him and his family"
29-05-2020T02:26:32,Ordithus,wow
29-05-2020T02:27:11,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"It is at $486,422 right now"
29-05-2020T02:27:14,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-excited:
29-05-2020T02:27:21,AspiringNoodle,He gonna have the bestest sports bar in the entire city~
29-05-2020T02:27:28,Ordithus,*sports bra
29-05-2020T02:27:36,AspiringNoodle,Don't make me smack you
29-05-2020T02:27:40,AspiringNoodle,"I want my hot wings, ahahaha"
29-05-2020T02:28:54,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Sage can I post the go fund me link for the bar rebuild?
29-05-2020T02:29:00,SageSaga,sure
29-05-2020T02:29:06,MarvTheHugPharaoh,https://www.gofundme.com/f/scores-bar-mpls-riot-rebuild?fbclid=IwAR34O7B5OjV7ZfDt6yANFWOX3BmdVntyrAdQ_rjb3JyvWWwnvxlrr0czkVA
29-05-2020T02:30:31,AspiringNoodle,Must see about making trip plans at some point
29-05-2020T02:33:12,SageSaga,im looking forward to Trump being banned from Twitter though
29-05-2020T02:33:56,AspiringNoodle,I feel like Twitter is gonna eff it up in some spectacular way and have it backfire :/
29-05-2020T02:34:43,SageSaga,not sure how- its their platform- what they says goes if they drop protections
29-05-2020T02:34:53,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Ted Cruz is demanded a criminal investigation in to twiiter for ""violating US sanctions on Iran.""  Not sure how far that's gonna go but.... yeah"
29-05-2020T02:35:11,AspiringNoodle,"Well Sage, that's the big problem"
29-05-2020T02:35:39,AspiringNoodle,If Twitter undeniably shows itself to be a publisher and has all protections stripped... well it becomes legally liable for EVERYTHING on its platform
29-05-2020T02:35:58,AspiringNoodle,So any stuff that was *probably* illegal that's still up on its platform?  It can be taken to court over.
29-05-2020T02:36:04,SageSaga,if Twitter has to become an editor they have to remove everyone they dont want- and you have to give time for them to do that
29-05-2020T02:36:32,SageSaga,"you cant just say ""it's now illegal to wear red"" and start throwing everyone in jail for wearing red at that moment"
29-05-2020T02:36:57,AspiringNoodle,"True.  But the problem is that there's so many posts, that it'd be impossible for them to ever get through it all without completely stopping or extremely limiting new posts"
29-05-2020T02:36:58,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Thank God I wear all black
29-05-2020T02:37:24,AspiringNoodle,"Or they have to rely on algorithms, but those will probably both leave problem posts intact and punish completely innocent users"
29-05-2020T02:37:28,Ordithus,marv is the night
29-05-2020T02:37:50,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I am the thing the night light you have plug in fights away
29-05-2020T02:37:57,AspiringNoodle,"And in the end, the result of Twitter's protections being revoked will be the collapse of the company"
29-05-2020T02:38:32,SageSaga,its unlikely that twitters protections will be stripped because an executive order cant overwrite congress (unless they let it)
29-05-2020T02:39:00,AspiringNoodle,"Iirc, it's not that he's stripping it outright, it's that he wants social media investigated"
29-05-2020T02:39:09,SageSaga,the likely effect though if anything changes is Twitter will have to remove trump for breaking the rules repeatedly
29-05-2020T02:39:30,AspiringNoodle,"A long running complaint is that social media have been acting in the capacity of a publisher, while at the same time claiming the protections of a platform.  They can't have it both ways!"
29-05-2020T02:39:54,SageSaga,yeah but its only happening now because Trump was targeted
29-05-2020T02:40:04,AspiringNoodle,And that's all that's needed
29-05-2020T02:40:33,Ordithus,because they finally applied the rules they've had and enforced for years to him
29-05-2020T02:40:56,SageSaga,*sigh* what looks worse? a President that only acts when it affects him directly or a company being a free enterprise?
29-05-2020T02:42:45,AspiringNoodle,That's a bit of a loaded question
29-05-2020T02:42:45,SageSaga,"""Our investigation shows that- Twitter showed a bias to- not delete the presidents messages even when they violated their terms of service- showing clear favoritism towards him"""
29-05-2020T02:42:55,Ordithus,for years
29-05-2020T02:43:12,AspiringNoodle,"That statement alone gives credence to the ""Twitter is a publisher not a platform"" argument..."
29-05-2020T02:43:40,SageSaga,"that ""statement"" is a joke"
29-05-2020T02:43:48,AspiringNoodle,"I won't defend Trump from his stupidity, but I WILL call out social media for its bullshit"
29-05-2020T02:44:14,SageSaga,like how Facebook says it wouldnt do what Twitter did- but does it?
29-05-2020T02:44:23,AspiringNoodle,Yup
29-05-2020T02:44:33,SageSaga,they do the exact same thing- so im guessing he meant we wouldnt do it to trump
29-05-2020T02:45:26,sunblaze,hi everyone
29-05-2020T02:45:27,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Zucker bot is planning on getting on ttrumps good side so he can get close and inject him with nano machines
29-05-2020T02:45:31,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Sun
29-05-2020T02:45:34,Ordithus,hi sun
29-05-2020T02:45:39,AspiringNoodle,Don't mind us :P
29-05-2020T02:46:13,SageSaga,"im just so sick of ""Why are our facts not the same as your facts?"" and the answer is almost always- well our facts are a majority of studies and well documented while yours are from some crackpot non-doctor/scientist"
29-05-2020T02:46:36,Ordithus,or karen on facebook
29-05-2020T02:46:37,AspiringNoodle,I feel like we're arguing on different subjects
29-05-2020T02:47:10,AspiringNoodle,I'm arguing that social media act as publishers while reaping the benefits of platform protections.
29-05-2020T02:47:18,SageSaga,nah its all the same- fact checking on trump was legit because it threatened the election and had true misinformation
29-05-2020T02:47:22,AspiringNoodle,But that they can't have it both ways...
29-05-2020T02:47:30,SageSaga,they have to though
29-05-2020T02:47:37,SageSaga,they cant just let people post whatever
29-05-2020T02:47:45,SageSaga,they have to walk the tight rope
29-05-2020T02:47:46,MarvTheHugPharaoh,You talking about the mail in voting thing?
29-05-2020T02:47:51,SageSaga,yeah
29-05-2020T02:47:56,AspiringNoodle,But that's the thing with a platform
29-05-2020T02:47:59,Ordithus,"oh, there was that too"
29-05-2020T02:48:09,AspiringNoodle,They only thing the host is responsible for is making sure no illegal things are put out there
29-05-2020T02:48:24,Ordithus,I thought we were talking about the shooting americans thing
29-05-2020T02:48:44,SageSaga,that was also bad...
29-05-2020T02:48:46,SageSaga,XD
29-05-2020T02:48:54,Ordithus,pisses me off major
29-05-2020T02:49:06,SageSaga,but the voting thing was what started it
29-05-2020T02:49:11,AspiringNoodle,"Once you start getting into the arena of facts / correctness / authenticity, that's a whole 'nother can of worms"
29-05-2020T02:50:17,Ordithus,"ban him for inciting violence, then they don't have to worry about fact checking him"
29-05-2020T02:50:45,AspiringNoodle,"Now THAT I can get behind, but you need a statement that makes a direct call for violence a person / group of people"
29-05-2020T02:50:46,SageSaga,"ok look- even if you can prove that mail in ballots COULD be more susceptible to fraud, he said several things that were completely false"
29-05-2020T02:50:55,AspiringNoodle,And / or heavily infers action against them
29-05-2020T02:51:13,sunblaze,twitter should jsut mark his thruth-statemants
29-05-2020T02:51:16,sunblaze,waaaay less work
29-05-2020T02:51:21,AspiringNoodle,Didn't they JUST arrest a mail courier for tampering with mail-in ballots?
29-05-2020T02:51:36,SageSaga,he said ballots were being sent out to everyone- not true- ballot applications were being sent to registered voters
29-05-2020T02:51:58,AspiringNoodle,"Oh yeah, that reminds me, we need to fix the damn voter registry!"
29-05-2020T02:52:13,AspiringNoodle,"Dead people can't vote, REMOVE THEM FROM THE LIST :ptv-angry:"
29-05-2020T02:52:30,Ordithus,good luck confirming that they're actually who you think they are
29-05-2020T02:52:46,Ordithus,and not a perfectly alive person with the same or similar name
29-05-2020T02:53:10,AspiringNoodle,I'll be honest
29-05-2020T02:53:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,NBC New York has a article
29-05-2020T02:53:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,NJ NAACP Leader Calls For Paterson Mail-In Vote to Be Canceled Amid Corruption Claims
29-05-2020T02:53:28,AspiringNoodle,I'd LOVE it if we could reduce out military budget and shift it to fixing some seriously degraded aspects of our country
29-05-2020T02:53:52,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Mind if I post the link to NBCs article?
29-05-2020T02:53:54,AspiringNoodle,"But to do that, we'd also need our allies to up their own military budgets so we stop playing military police :/"
29-05-2020T02:54:02,AspiringNoodle,world police*
29-05-2020T02:54:04,SageSaga,the truth is - it seems like when voter fraud happens its easy to find out about- and it also rarely happens.
29-05-2020T02:54:36,AspiringNoodle,*would like to point out areas of the country with over 100% voter participation*
29-05-2020T02:55:31,SageSaga,like those counties with 5 registered voters that vote?
29-05-2020T02:55:38,sunblaze,^but that can easily be done in the regular vote offices as well. that is not mail-vote based
29-05-2020T02:56:03,AspiringNoodle,The truthfully truthful truth is that voter fraud happens all the time
29-05-2020T02:56:18,Ordithus,if you say truth that many times I am inclined to doubt
29-05-2020T02:56:26,AspiringNoodle,"But our systems are so damn archaic and / or vulnerable to tampering, and we do nothing to fix it"
29-05-2020T02:56:46,Ordithus,got evidence of that rampant voter fraud?
29-05-2020T02:56:47,sunblaze,@noodle might I ask what is so archaic?
29-05-2020T02:56:47,SageSaga,"are you talking about Wood Country, Ohio?"
29-05-2020T02:57:25,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"I read that as arachnid, I was very confused"
29-05-2020T02:57:28,sunblaze,"I can only speak from german experience, but we still use printed sheets and a bin that gets the filled documents. and they are still counted by volunteers."
29-05-2020T02:57:30,AspiringNoodle,I need to find this one form of fraud I learned about in college
29-05-2020T02:57:35,sunblaze,how much older does it get?
29-05-2020T02:57:40,Ordithus,at this point spiders would be more pleasant
29-05-2020T02:57:52,AspiringNoodle,Some electronic voting machines are pretty vulnerable
29-05-2020T02:57:52,SageSaga,Sunblaze- wood tablets
29-05-2020T02:58:02,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"You say that, but I just had to smash shelob a few minutes ago"
29-05-2020T02:58:27,Ordithus,did you use a mythril blade?
29-05-2020T02:58:44,SageSaga,i am done with my work btw
29-05-2020T02:58:47,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I used a corsair h100i V2 box
29-05-2020T02:58:53,AspiringNoodle,Looks nice <3
29-05-2020T02:58:54,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Very well done Sage
29-05-2020T02:59:00,Ordithus,looks good! glad to be outside again
29-05-2020T02:59:04,sunblaze,ohhh good suggestion I'c laim I want my stone tablet and a chisel for my next vote. great idea!
29-05-2020T02:59:22,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-power: vote in blood
29-05-2020T02:59:36,SpazztasticKiwi,"fraud accounts to .00006% of total votes cast - there has been a total case of 1,200 cases since stinking 1979"
29-05-2020T02:59:48,Ordithus,kiwi with numbers
29-05-2020T02:59:50,sunblaze,I disadvise against that since then everyone would use the same knife to cut themselves
29-05-2020T03:00:00,AspiringNoodle,Source plz :D
29-05-2020T03:00:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"for the love of Christ, read a government data page"
29-05-2020T03:00:11,Ordithus,"likewise, noodle"
29-05-2020T03:00:53,AspiringNoodle,"Also, I'm gonna take a guess and say that's *proven* cases?"
29-05-2020T03:01:14,Ordithus,"anything other than proven is pure speculation, now isn't it"
29-05-2020T03:01:42,SpazztasticKiwi,"I encourage involvement in the DeFranco community - he is an independent “reporter” and news man, whatever you want to call him since he owns his own show & team, who sources and"
29-05-2020T03:01:56,SpazztasticKiwi,covers this stuff
29-05-2020T03:02:02,AspiringNoodle,"To be fair, the best criminal is the one who never gets caught"
29-05-2020T03:02:38,SageSaga,conspiracy theorist love the man in the shadows that is to blame for all their facts being wrong
29-05-2020T03:02:44,SpazztasticKiwi,"including Mr George’s death, & has been on it consistently for updates"
29-05-2020T03:02:57,sunblaze,the criminal never caught is still in no register and his case never impacted anyone. e.g. he also did not steal anything
29-05-2020T03:03:21,sunblaze,there is STILL a case if unsolved just not with a suspect
29-05-2020T03:03:51,SageSaga,gnight folks! take care!
29-05-2020T03:04:00,Ordithus,night sage!  thanks for the stream

29-05-2020T03:06:13,AspiringNoodle,The past hour is a prime example of why people tend to avoid political discussions online :P
29-05-2020T03:06:43,Ordithus,nobody needed to be banned!
29-05-2020T03:06:49,Ordithus,I call that a success

29-05-2020T03:15:34,SpazztasticKiwi,he wants doubt so he can cry wolf if he loses
29-05-2020T03:15:40,SpazztasticKiwi,that’s literally it
29-05-2020T03:16:41,SpazztasticKiwi,"also I’d like to add that when Sage started streaming, I piped on for a weeeee second and I gotta say...."

29-05-2020T03:18:10,SpazztasticKiwi,it was just the beginning outline
29-05-2020T03:18:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"but it was bootyliscious soooo, I guess the answer is whoevers butt is bigger"
29-05-2020T03:19:04,SageSaga,Nyna's is bigger by percentage of body mass!
29-05-2020T03:19:23,SpazztasticKiwi,sadly I twas at work and not quite on break so I couldn’t sit and play investigation discovery

29-05-2020T14:16:53,SageSaga,picarto connection is going blaaaaah
29-05-2020T14:17:52,sunblaze,hmm seems fine here
29-05-2020T14:18:27,AspiringNoodle,^
29-05-2020T14:18:29,SageSaga,the stream connection went to 0 for about 30 seconds
29-05-2020T14:18:32,Dadrobit,Hey Sage o/
29-05-2020T14:18:37,SageSaga,yo Robit
29-05-2020T14:18:46,AspiringNoodle,"Dadro, havin' fun?"
29-05-2020T14:18:49,Dadrobit,So I binged Escaflowne this week.
29-05-2020T14:19:30,SageSaga,and?
29-05-2020T14:19:31,Dadrobit,I see where you got the Hitomi is super depressive character trait.
29-05-2020T14:20:41,Dadrobit,In the show she's almost entirely upbeat if she's not concerned about someone's safety in the moment. But in the movie... The movie is like a feverdream someone had about the show that they only have information on from hearing about it second hand.
29-05-2020T14:21:14,Dadrobit,The movie retcons her as someone who's super depressed in their life.
29-05-2020T14:22:01,AspiringNoodle,*sigh* movies...
29-05-2020T14:22:08,SageSaga,the movie is more in line with the original story
29-05-2020T14:22:22,Dadrobit,"I actually appreciate how they represent it initially. ""I'm just always tired, nothing really excites me anymore"" is pretty true to life."
29-05-2020T14:22:45,Dadrobit,Kinda jarring how quickly she gets over it though.
29-05-2020T14:22:56,SageSaga,well being thrown into a fantasy world can do that-
29-05-2020T14:23:19,SageSaga,kinda how like lots of my life are depressing but as i read books and make comics i feel better
29-05-2020T14:23:35,AspiringNoodle,Reality is overrated
29-05-2020T14:23:40,AspiringNoodle,Fantasy is where it's at :ptv-excited:
29-05-2020T14:23:58,sunblaze,^
29-05-2020T14:24:01,Dadrobit,"The catalyst wasn't the act of being transported, it was a conversation with Merle about how Vaan is actually a nice guy when you get to know him, but he's a loner since his family was murdered."
29-05-2020T14:24:24,Dadrobit,"Also, the gratuitous upskirt shots on Merle were.... gratuitous..."
29-05-2020T14:24:43,AspiringNoodle,Gratuitous fan service is gratuitous :ptv-snicker:
29-05-2020T14:24:54,AspiringNoodle,We talking Highschool of the Dead levels here?
29-05-2020T14:24:59,Dadrobit,Let's not fan service the child character eh?
29-05-2020T14:25:25,AspiringNoodle,I'll take that as a yes
29-05-2020T14:25:54,Dadrobit,It was a fun binge watch regardless tho.
29-05-2020T14:26:30,SageSaga,what did they call her? Goddess of Wings? Or Goddess of Wind?
29-05-2020T14:26:48,Dadrobit,I forgot how fantastic Dilandou is as a chaotic evil character. He's an absolute treat! His warped animation towards the end was 11/10 top notch.
29-05-2020T14:26:54,Dadrobit,Winged Goddess I think it was.
29-05-2020T14:27:02,SageSaga,alright yeah-
29-05-2020T14:27:28,SageSaga,either way- wings or wind are both symbols of change especially in Japanese lore
29-05-2020T14:27:46,SageSaga,she was the goddess that appeared to signal change
29-05-2020T14:28:09,Dadrobit,Though I reightfully expunged the revelation that the big bad evil guy was legit just Sir Issac Newton in the show. That was just a bit too far on the silly side for my appreciations.
29-05-2020T14:28:24,SageSaga,XD
29-05-2020T14:30:31,Dadrobit,"I just dunno how to feel about the movie in the end. I liked it well enough, but it did feel very rushed. Which I think is just kind of an inevitability with how much they tried to pack in 95 minutes."
29-05-2020T14:30:32,SageSaga,i wonder if season 2 of drifters is ever coming out
29-05-2020T14:31:26,Dadrobit,Can't say I'm even familiar with season one lol.
29-05-2020T14:31:36,SageSaga,the anime obviously
29-05-2020T14:31:48,SageSaga,the secret bad guy is Jesus
29-05-2020T14:31:55,Dadrobit,Pffft lmfao
29-05-2020T14:32:03,Dadrobit,you've got my interest
29-05-2020T14:32:31,AspiringNoodle,"""JESUS, TAKE THE WHEEL!"""
29-05-2020T14:32:34,AspiringNoodle,"Jesus: ""No."""
29-05-2020T14:32:42,AspiringNoodle,"""#@$%"""
29-05-2020T14:33:16,SageSaga,Jesus like gave a dragon cancer
29-05-2020T14:34:40,SageSaga,he was walking through a bunch of monsters healing them talking about how he was betrayed by man and will now end man
29-05-2020T14:35:02,SageSaga,and all the characters from this show are based on historical figures
29-05-2020T14:35:07,AspiringNoodle,Did he happen to look like Kurt Russell
29-05-2020T14:35:10,AspiringNoodle,I must know
29-05-2020T14:35:11,SageSaga,that got isekai'd
29-05-2020T14:35:21,SageSaga,he wore a shroud
29-05-2020T14:35:25,AspiringNoodle,Damn
29-05-2020T14:35:48,AspiringNoodle,"If he looked like Kurt Russell, I coulda claimed that GotG2 ripped off Escaflowne :ptv-laugh:"
29-05-2020T14:36:21,Dadrobit,Didn't SNL do a skit forever ago around Jesus coming back as the terminator? Reminds me of that.
29-05-2020T14:36:47,AspiringNoodle,"Oh God... does that mean that even if you kill him, he'll just rise up again?!?"
29-05-2020T14:37:08,SageSaga,that was true before hand-
29-05-2020T14:37:18,Dadrobit,"""The greatest action movie ever told"""
29-05-2020T14:37:46,AspiringNoodle,...well my mind is weird...
29-05-2020T14:37:56,AspiringNoodle,Random thoughts are random
29-05-2020T14:38:16,AspiringNoodle,aaaaaaaaaaaabs~
29-05-2020T14:39:20,SageSaga,XD that reminds me
29-05-2020T14:40:07,SageSaga,there was an article about a lickable screen that can replicate whatever is on screen tastes like- and it then shows a picture of Tifa's abs
29-05-2020T14:40:17,AspiringNoodle,oh god
29-05-2020T14:40:41,SageSaga,ok well that was what someone else posted- it wasnt saying you can lick her abs- it was just - what thirsty internet people want
29-05-2020T14:40:52,AspiringNoodle,Oh god
29-05-2020T14:41:07,AspiringNoodle,*looks at TV*
29-05-2020T14:41:10,AspiringNoodle,OH GOD :ptv-whiny:
29-05-2020T14:41:30,SageSaga,if such a device becomes a thing- im gonna have to encode flavors to Nyna and Kaylin-
29-05-2020T14:41:38,SageSaga,what should Nyna taste like?
29-05-2020T14:42:03,SageSaga,maybe some kinda sweet and sour-
29-05-2020T14:42:27,SageSaga,while Kaylin will taste like chocolate and strawberries
29-05-2020T14:42:49,AspiringNoodle,Hunger Games 1: Rue just died T_T
29-05-2020T14:42:52,SageSaga,and Callum will taste like jail

29-05-2020T14:44:26,SageSaga,Flora would taste like a dream sickle-
29-05-2020T14:44:31,SageSaga,based on colors
29-05-2020T14:45:16,Dadrobit,"Now I want a dreamsicle, haven't had one since I was a kid..."
29-05-2020T14:45:32,Sclimshady,I love dreamsicles
29-05-2020T14:46:53,AspiringNoodle,Would Trace taste like blueberry of sea salt?
29-05-2020T14:46:57,AspiringNoodle,or*
29-05-2020T14:47:24,SageSaga,salted taffy
29-05-2020T14:47:36,AspiringNoodle,Hmm...
29-05-2020T14:47:40,AspiringNoodle,Would Laura taste like nothing?
29-05-2020T14:47:51,SageSaga,ectocooler
29-05-2020T14:48:09,AspiringNoodle,Clovis?
29-05-2020T14:48:17,SageSaga,rice
29-05-2020T14:48:33,AspiringNoodle,Brutus? :ptv-excited:
29-05-2020T14:48:54,SageSaga,fresh butter biscuits
29-05-2020T14:48:59,AspiringNoodle,GIMMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
29-05-2020T14:49:42,BadFoMo,What would Nyna taste like? 1. What brought up the lickable screen? 2. How about Snauzberries?
29-05-2020T14:49:46,Dadrobit,Raine is a giant gobstopper that alternates flavors the longer you spend consuming it.
29-05-2020T14:50:07,BadFoMo,I probably butcherd the spelling again.
29-05-2020T14:51:10,SageSaga,the mentioning of Abs and this twitter link is what brought it up - https://twitter.com/luulubuu/status/1265817635930943488
29-05-2020T14:51:34,BadFoMo,Thanks.
29-05-2020T14:51:44,SageSaga,you are welcome :P
29-05-2020T14:53:33,Dadrobit,Natani is like one of those sculpted deserts that looks like a hamburger but actually turns out to be chocolate cake.
29-05-2020T14:55:03,SageSaga,so you lick it and think at first bread from the expectation of a burger but suddenly sweet chocolate and frosting
29-05-2020T14:57:29,Sclimshady,Please do not lick Raine Dad
29-05-2020T14:58:37,BadFoMo,And now I'm thinking of errors in the programing making one thing taste like something else; and what that can do to people.
29-05-2020T14:59:06,Dadrobit,"Trust me, I spent a whole minute trying to phrase that sentance as wholesomely as I could. ""Consume"" was the best option available."
29-05-2020T15:00:26,Dadrobit,Maybe a more apt comparison for Natani specificlly is a cake that turns out to be made of meatloaf.
29-05-2020T15:01:17,BadFoMo,"makes the Troll Face and tries to get Dadrobit into mild trouble by saying ""You want to 'consume' Raine?""."
29-05-2020T15:02:24,Dadrobit,"I mean, there are worse options."
29-05-2020T15:02:45,Sclimshady,All the options are the worst option
29-05-2020T15:04:06,Ordithus,:csagesaga-nynasmirk: yo

29-05-2020T15:08:47,BadFoMo,...Is it your cat?
29-05-2020T15:10:13,SpazztasticKiwi,if Bagheera is so heavy I can’t move my shoulder he needs a diet

29-05-2020T15:50:06,Werewing,I know the feeling. AC was broken for a few days recently. Only just got over the heat exhaustion.
29-05-2020T15:50:26,JojoGD,Yo

29-05-2020T15:57:00,Werewing,Darkness hasn't had teeth in a long time. It is a toothless void.
