04-04-2020T00:38:18,SpazztasticKiwi,hooWuW
04-04-2020T00:45:48,AspiringNoodle,I am so confused
04-04-2020T00:45:56,AspiringNoodle,$372 payment from work
04-04-2020T00:46:10,AspiringNoodle,That's like... 2 paychecks in one
04-04-2020T00:46:38,AspiringNoodle,Week earlier: $162
04-04-2020T00:50:16,CrRAR,Surprise hazard pay?
04-04-2020T00:51:48,CrRAR,Though that is quite a lot of a 'surprise'.
04-04-2020T00:53:31,AspiringNoodle,"Hmmm, might be related to the new company rearranging the work week / changing pay day"
04-04-2020T00:54:08,AspiringNoodle,Quite possible that that's pay for 6 days of work @ ~23 hours per week
04-04-2020T00:54:18,AspiringNoodle,(aka per 3 days)
04-04-2020T00:58:33,AspiringNoodle,Hmmm
04-04-2020T00:58:44,AspiringNoodle,Seems like a big chunk of pay is coming from an item called HRLY RET INCENT
04-04-2020T00:59:10,AspiringNoodle,hourly retainment incentive?
04-04-2020T01:02:50,AspiringNoodle,Do they know I'm thinking about quitting?!?
04-04-2020T01:03:06,AspiringNoodle,Tin foil! I need tin foil! :ptv-shock:

04-04-2020T14:27:29,Twokinds,"So in a way, it's less suggestions over all"
04-04-2020T14:27:37,Twokinds,Less competition
04-04-2020T14:27:37,Roughlandin,This is true
04-04-2020T14:27:39,iliar,haha ... A simple way to get pic with favorite character. People love fan service. Even I decided to join the crowd.

04-04-2020T14:31:52,ProsePro7,I will gladly take alergies it has not gotten over the 50s here in weeks I am sick of the cold
04-04-2020T14:32:54,Roughlandin,It's been getting into the 70s here. Still super cold over night though. I've been having to play AC/Heat tic tac toe so I don't freeze at night and heat stroke during the day

04-04-2020T14:36:20,ProsePro7,Apparently he has taken to sleeping hours like a cat
04-04-2020T14:37:08,Roughlandin,Don't blame him. Not much else to do right now other than binge streaming sites and play games. I've become addicted to Animal Crossing...
04-04-2020T14:37:37,AspiringNoodle,I just slept for 10 hours today
04-04-2020T14:37:40,AspiringNoodle,So I know how he feels

04-04-2020T14:40:36,Roughlandin,Writing is the only other thing I have to do. I've been working on a Carver fan project that started as a silly short based on the Hula Girls sketch... and kinda... ballooned into like... a novella.

04-04-2020T14:44:30,ProsePro7,One of them that Im doing is Game of Thrones length so I had to switch to a shorter one.

04-04-2020T14:52:56,AspiringNoodle,There's so much thirst in the suggestions this week it makes the Sahara look like a freakin' oasis
04-04-2020T14:53:01,ProsePro7,Oh yeah for those of you that missed it we go 17 good morning suggestions
04-04-2020T14:53:02,ThingsAreMoving,"Why are you holding your favorite Zen art in a can, Marv? :eyes:"
04-04-2020T14:53:05,Twokinds,It's hard to find duplicates
04-04-2020T14:53:10,Twokinds,Because people use different wording
04-04-2020T14:53:17,Twokinds,"And some are similiar, but not similiar enough to be combined"

04-04-2020T15:00:50,Ordithus,"Something something staying inside, I'd wager"
04-04-2020T15:00:55,FloofyCat,Hi everone!
04-04-2020T15:00:56,SpazztasticKiwi,"if you condense the thirst, it‚Äôll build until the dam can hold any longer and then it‚Äôll drown us all"

04-04-2020T15:01:19,ProsePro7,The cast in masks
04-04-2020T15:01:20,Twokinds,I've gotten one or two for characters wearing masks or saying 'wash your hands'
04-04-2020T15:01:22,Roughlandin,Drowning in lewds is how I'd want to go
04-04-2020T15:01:29,ProsePro7,Called it
04-04-2020T15:01:32,Ordithus,So like a PSA
04-04-2020T15:01:33,Twokinds,"Which is fine and all, but Twokinds is an escape from real life."
04-04-2020T15:01:40,ProsePro7,Thank you

04-04-2020T15:18:59,ThingsAreMoving,Sour cream in baking makes as much difference to the taste as buttermilk in KFC batter
04-04-2020T15:19:00,Roughlandin,The sour cream goes in the dough. I think it replaces the butter or the milk.
04-04-2020T15:19:05,ThingsAreMoving,You can't taste it

04-04-2020T15:30:38,CrimsonQuill,But I like the characters and the story
04-04-2020T15:30:43,CrimsonQuill,That's why I read it
04-04-2020T15:30:54,Brocade,"There‚Äôs lots of fanservice in these streams, and I don‚Äôt mean it negatively"
04-04-2020T15:30:57,Roughlandin,TK is the least furry furry comic. It bridges the gap
04-04-2020T15:30:58,FloofyCat,Does anyone know how long the stream is delayed for? I want to sneak a quick shower in but don't want to miss the stream.
04-04-2020T15:31:07,johnnytho,Gamers are high schoolers who dont realize cringe culture is dead
04-04-2020T15:31:09,CrimsonQuill,@FloofyCat no idea
04-04-2020T15:31:16,Rainelover,"Don‚Äôt listen to the haters crimson, for our goddess raine of the forest watches over us"
04-04-2020T15:31:18,Roughlandin,Waiting for Tom to compile the vote list Floof
04-04-2020T15:31:24,CrimsonQuill,"That's kinda why I don't want to be called a ""Furry"""
04-04-2020T15:31:25,NeonMitsumi,"""Gamers are high schoolers who dont realize cringe culture is dead"" That quote is for the books."
04-04-2020T15:31:34,johnnytho,ha
04-04-2020T15:31:51,CrimsonQuill,'Cause I'm afraid people would associate me with the extremes of the stereotype
04-04-2020T15:31:52,ThingsAreMoving,Imagine caring what some punks on the internet think about you. Just tell them to go back to fortnite or some othe candy crush game where they came from.
04-04-2020T15:32:00,ProsePro7,Furry has negative connotations even though it doesn't deserve it
04-04-2020T15:32:09,BadFoMo,@Roughlandin Think he fell asleep at the keyboard?
04-04-2020T15:32:11,ProsePro7,There is always the option of Anthro
04-04-2020T15:32:13,CrimsonQuill,"I do need to grow a thicker skin, that is true"
04-04-2020T15:32:23,TeapotOfDoom,and even then the stereotype is getting less pronounced
04-04-2020T15:32:30,CrimsonQuill,Mmm
04-04-2020T15:32:36,Brocade,"Tom goes to Anthrocon every year, so..."
04-04-2020T15:32:42,CrimsonQuill,I'm much better at Drawing Raine than I used to be anyway
04-04-2020T15:32:45,Roughlandin,Yeah the days of furries being the punchline for every joke are kind of passing
04-04-2020T15:32:51,Rainelover,@crimsonquill Well the people that do know not what they are talking about
04-04-2020T15:32:51,Brocade,Not everything I there is furry
04-04-2020T15:32:55,johnnytho,"Sonic is cool, minecraft is cool, being lgbt is cool, furries are ok, dont let the reddit r/dankmeme nerds tell you otherwise"
04-04-2020T15:32:57,CrimsonQuill,So I can finally make her look nice in Spartan Armor
04-04-2020T15:33:00,ThingsAreMoving,"By extension, everyone who enjoyed watching duck tales is a furry and a degenerate. So... 90% of modern civilisation?"
04-04-2020T15:33:03,TeapotOfDoom,early furcons were a shitshow but that's not comparable to something like a modern anthrocon i guess
04-04-2020T15:33:05,Brocade,"Yeah, as Something Awful and 4chan fade into irrelevance"
04-04-2020T15:33:11,CrimsonQuill,Uuuh
04-04-2020T15:33:11,NeonMitsumi,"Everything is cool, but furries are ok xD"
04-04-2020T15:33:12,ProsePro7,Don't be ashamed Crim.  The stuff I write is what I write because I like it if people can only knock it because its furry then its good stuff or else they would tear it apart in another way
04-04-2020T15:33:15,CrimsonQuill,I did look at 4chan
04-04-2020T15:33:18,CrimsonQuill,For 40k memes
04-04-2020T15:33:24,CrimsonQuill,Forgot that there is other stuff..
04-04-2020T15:33:30,BadFoMo,I think of myself more as a 'fan of Anthro'.
04-04-2020T15:33:30,johnnytho,Yes as a furry myself furries are ...OK
04-04-2020T15:33:31,CrimsonQuill,EYE BLEACH NEEDED AFTERWARDS
04-04-2020T15:33:41,CrimsonQuill,I have sworn never to venture to 4chan again
04-04-2020T15:33:46,CrimsonQuill,The 40k memes were good
04-04-2020T15:33:49,ProsePro7,Bleach flavored Cola mmm!
04-04-2020T15:33:50,NeonMitsumi,"I agree with you, but I just find it amusing."
04-04-2020T15:33:55,CrimsonQuill,But the NFSW was...not so much
04-04-2020T15:33:56,TeapotOfDoom,4chan is hard stuff
04-04-2020T15:34:06,TeapotOfDoom,went there once
04-04-2020T15:34:10,CrimsonQuill,I keep quoting Commander Boreale from Dawn of War
04-04-2020T15:34:12,johnnytho,I didnt know Tom went to anthrocon
04-04-2020T15:34:13,TeapotOfDoom,bleached my eyes afterwards
04-04-2020T15:34:16,CrimsonQuill,SPESS MEHREENS
04-04-2020T15:34:17,ProsePro7,Remember kids look out for rule 34 it'll ge ya
04-04-2020T15:34:22,ThingsAreMoving,"Meh, the real eyebleach stuff faded into oblivion after habbo hotel raids"
04-04-2020T15:34:25,Rainelover,I saw something genuinely wholesome on 4chan a couple days ago
04-04-2020T15:34:30,CrimsonQuill,Heck
04-04-2020T15:34:41,CrimsonQuill,I needed brain bleach 2 days ago
04-04-2020T15:34:42,Roughlandin,I don't even really consider myself a furry. I'm not interested in cons or fursuiting and I don't really want to be a bear or something. It's just bear me is less ugly and more interesting than flabby human me
04-04-2020T15:35:04,Rainelover,It was weird considering what 4chan generally is
04-04-2020T15:35:04,ThingsAreMoving,Work that body and become a bear
04-04-2020T15:35:11,RimaDraws,i need bleach now
04-04-2020T15:35:28,HoverdudeXL,No stream today either
04-04-2020T15:35:29,Roughlandin,"Oh I can work this bear body, Things"
04-04-2020T15:35:31,CrimsonQuill,"I don't consider myself a furry either...But I like twokinds, and find some art with Anthropomorphic characters (Like that by AlectorFencer and Twokinds) to be amazing and beautiful."
04-04-2020T15:35:35,CrimsonQuill,What happened Rima?
04-04-2020T15:35:37,Roughlandin,Stream is coming Hover
04-04-2020T15:35:39,RimaDraws,he is still getting things around
04-04-2020T15:35:41,RimaDraws,give it time
04-04-2020T15:35:42,johnnytho,"4chan is just made up stories, porn, and edgy tryhards saying offensive stuff to get into arguments"
04-04-2020T15:35:46,HoverdudeXL,Ok
04-04-2020T15:35:46,Roughlandin,"Same, Quill"
04-04-2020T15:35:49,ProsePro7,Furry is just a fan of anthro characters everything else is just extra
04-04-2020T15:36:00,Rainelover,Exactly
04-04-2020T15:36:13,Avolendi,"From what I picked up over time, the term ""furry"" is vague as hell and the less people know of it, the sooner the most negative association is made. So like Prose said, probably easier to just call it an anthro comic"
04-04-2020T15:36:14,TeapotOfDoom,what's the word if someone states somthing to be bad but does it themselves
04-04-2020T15:36:17,CrimsonQuill,Still trying to decide whether I should make Halo Raine have the Floof or not
04-04-2020T15:36:23,Roughlandin,Then I guess I am a furry. NEVER going to admit it to my RL friends though
04-04-2020T15:36:25,ThingsAreMoving,"hypocrisy, Teapot"
04-04-2020T15:36:35,CrimsonQuill,It'd be a nice justification for why ONI want her
04-04-2020T15:36:35,TeapotOfDoom,thx
04-04-2020T15:36:43,TeapotOfDoom,r/dankmemes are hypocrits
04-04-2020T15:36:53,TeapotOfDoom,in the worst sense
04-04-2020T15:36:55,ProsePro7,When you get too 0w0 around your normy friends
04-04-2020T15:36:59,TeapotOfDoom,there are furry memes on there
04-04-2020T15:37:09,johnnytho,r/memekinds bros
04-04-2020T15:37:09,ThingsAreMoving,"Meh, some people do everything for the lulz"
04-04-2020T15:37:15,Twokinds,ok
04-04-2020T15:37:17,Roughlandin,There's a subreddit that isn't full of hypocrits? That would be news

04-04-2020T15:40:16,Brocade,The part where we learned Moot created a monster
04-04-2020T15:40:22,CrimsonQuill,@Greendyes I had expected someone of your Reputation to be a little...Taller.
04-04-2020T15:40:23,Glassan,"Crimson, I haven't seen that in years, I didn't even know there was a part 5 yet. >_>"

04-04-2020T15:40:55,Roughlandin,I see someone has already made a vaporwave gif of the Kat x Mike 90s pic...
04-04-2020T15:40:59,Glassan,"Eh, Moot didn't create the monster, he just built the gate for it to get out."
04-04-2020T15:41:11,BadFoMo,@Roughlandin A what?
04-04-2020T15:41:11,tehbear,There is a warhammer 40k tv serie now?
04-04-2020T15:41:21,ThingsAreMoving,It's fan made
04-04-2020T15:41:22,CrimsonQuill,It's a fan animation
04-04-2020T15:41:28,ThingsAreMoving,But ultra high quality
04-04-2020T15:41:40,CrimsonQuill,"With professional quality, and SUPREME attention to lore detail"
04-04-2020T15:41:41,Glassan,Most of what I know about WH40K comes from an old turbonerd roommate and TTS

04-04-2020T15:42:51,tehbear,"vaporwave also seems to be a pun on vaporware, software that never was released, because it was just marketing people creating hot air"

04-04-2020T15:44:21,CrimsonQuill,What do you think would happen
04-04-2020T15:44:35,CrimsonQuill,If Halo Raine met Twokinds Rainwe
04-04-2020T15:44:56,CrimsonQuill,With Twokinds Raine coming through the portal Flora went through for the Banhammer battle
04-04-2020T15:45:15,Roughlandin,A lot of fanservicey slashfics?
04-04-2020T15:45:17,CrimsonQuill,Just Two Raines talking while Flora and Thomas duke it out with hammers in the background
04-04-2020T15:45:21,CrimsonQuill,NO FANSERVICE
04-04-2020T15:45:24,Glassan,"@CrimsonQuill, Not sure about that, although now I can't stop thinking of what normal Red thinks of Cortana Red"

04-04-2020T15:45:33,CrimsonQuill,I'm thinking that too
04-04-2020T15:45:38,CrimsonQuill,How would they react?
04-04-2020T15:45:44,Roughlandin,It's Raine. Slashfics are what she's best at

04-04-2020T17:24:22,Rolley,@roughlandin I‚Äôm doing pencil and paper the scanning it onto my computer so it‚Äôs digital until I can afford a tablet. So you don‚Äôt have to have a good setup to get started
04-04-2020T17:24:26,CrimsonQuill,Searhed song
04-04-2020T17:24:33,CrimsonQuill,Having trouble finding it
04-04-2020T17:24:57,Roughlandin,Yeah but I can't correct my MANY mistakes with pencil. Or I'll erase through the paper if I try lol
04-04-2020T17:25:00,CrimsonQuill,Ah well
04-04-2020T17:25:15,xcvb,The sound of bending ferret brought me here ;)
04-04-2020T17:25:19,Avolendi,"Draw light, if you're not already? ^^;"
04-04-2020T17:25:24,Mippy,*facepalm* you don't need a setup at all
04-04-2020T17:25:32,Rolley,Draw lightly and erase when you need to
04-04-2020T17:25:57,FloofyCat,"Tom did you see the ferret (Buttercup) dance cover thingy? There's one with the ferret, then an animated one."
04-04-2020T17:26:00,Rolley,Use pressure to make it permanent
04-04-2020T17:26:28,Avolendi,Another approach is to draw lightly and draw a bit heavier over when you're more sure of the lines later
04-04-2020T17:26:49,CrimsonQuill,I start out with a 5h or h
04-04-2020T17:26:53,CrimsonQuill,Then go to hb
04-04-2020T17:26:55,CrimsonQuill,then ink
04-04-2020T17:26:55,Mippy,Tablets are lux items. you don't need them to make art
04-04-2020T17:26:57,KeefMcDerpface,"Why do I got the feeling, despite being cute, human Reni's screams are like Canary's from DC comics."
04-04-2020T17:27:08,Roughlandin,SCREE
04-04-2020T17:27:13,AspiringNoodle,"H pencils for sketching, B for permanent linework"
04-04-2020T17:27:36,Thereddragon525,"I agree, keef."
04-04-2020T17:27:55,xcvb,"@Mippy I do agree with you, but, there are a lot of entry level tablets for every one"
04-04-2020T17:28:01,Roughlandin,This is starting to sound like a lot of art materials that will wind up being closer in price together than it would be to just buy a basic tablet
04-04-2020T17:28:20,CrimsonQuill,Nah
04-04-2020T17:28:28,Mippy,You don't even need differnt pencils. You can do a whole drawing with a single pencil. Just stop murdering the lead with your pushg
04-04-2020T17:28:29,Xexanoth,Reni doing her best Taiga impression
04-04-2020T17:28:33,CrimsonQuill,You can buy a few normal pencils dirt cheap
04-04-2020T17:28:36,CrimsonQuill,50c each
04-04-2020T17:28:50,Roughlandin,I HAVE GIANT BEAR HANDS I CAN'T HELP IT!
04-04-2020T17:28:50,KeefMcDerpface,Quill is right.
04-04-2020T17:28:56,AspiringNoodle,You can get some drawing tablets in the $30 range
04-04-2020T17:28:58,Tharkis,"i love ""rawr"" pose =)"
04-04-2020T17:28:59,ThingsAreMoving,"So, drawing people. What should be the absolute most basic thing to start when drawing? Copying lineart or learning how to construct drawings from scratch?"
04-04-2020T17:29:02,AspiringNoodle,Though they tend to be VERY tiny
04-04-2020T17:29:10,Tharkis,(even my profile pic is tharkitty doing 'rawr' pose!)
04-04-2020T17:29:15,Brocade,Reni's outfit is so cute
04-04-2020T17:29:15,xcvb,@Mippy also charcoal pencils are awesome
04-04-2020T17:29:23,ThingsAreMoving,"Or maybe something else, entirely?"
04-04-2020T17:29:26,CrimsonQuill,I say just...draw from scratch
04-04-2020T17:29:30,CrimsonQuill,Basic shapes first
04-04-2020T17:29:34,Brocade,I wonder if the pants will be as low-riding as her grass skirt...
04-04-2020T17:29:34,CrimsonQuill,Then move up
04-04-2020T17:29:36,AspiringNoodle,If you want a more formal approach ^
04-04-2020T17:29:39,CrimsonQuill,Try drawing from life too
04-04-2020T17:29:43,AspiringNoodle,"Basic shapes, like spheres, boxes, cylinders"
04-04-2020T17:30:00,CrimsonQuill,"As painful as it can be, it really helps get down the shapes properly"
04-04-2020T17:30:00,unsteddyphoenix,Youtube tutorials and copying references
04-04-2020T17:30:09,unsteddyphoenix,Those were the only things I could do without getting bored
04-04-2020T17:30:10,CrimsonQuill,References are godsend
04-04-2020T17:30:12,AspiringNoodle,"Maybe start with shapes only, then move onto shading and lighting"
04-04-2020T17:30:25,AspiringNoodle,Then start sketching organic shapes
04-04-2020T17:30:27,CrimsonQuill,I legitimately can't draw Mjolnir armor that well without a reference
04-04-2020T17:30:32,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,Hi Tom
04-04-2020T17:30:33,AspiringNoodle,"Get comfortable there, then again, shading and lighting"
04-04-2020T17:30:33,CrimsonQuill,At the moment at least
04-04-2020T17:30:40,AspiringNoodle,It's a process~
04-04-2020T17:30:41,KeefMcDerpface,Hello Deathclaw
04-04-2020T17:30:58,unsteddyphoenix,"See noodles advice may be good, but it's putting me to sleep just reading it"
04-04-2020T17:31:16,unsteddyphoenix,Not getting bored is the main enemy
04-04-2020T17:31:21,CrRAR,organic shapes you say? :apple:
04-04-2020T17:31:23,AspiringNoodle,"Hey, I did say it was a formal process ;P"
04-04-2020T17:31:28,ThingsAreMoving,I don't have a good attention span either tbh.
04-04-2020T17:31:34,Mippy,Both are benifitial Things. Draw from scratch but you can copy in order to learn different teqniques. Artists use referances all the time. The thing is learing the differance between referancing and outright copying
04-04-2020T17:31:36,AspiringNoodle,"Formal heavily implies boring / structured, lol"
04-04-2020T17:31:43,Roughlandin,"Can I just ""Click"" my way through the next 17 years and skip to the being as good as Tom part?"
04-04-2020T17:31:49,AspiringNoodle,Yup
04-04-2020T17:31:54,xcvb,"oh, the time of fun I had with learning to draw clouds"
04-04-2020T17:31:57,AspiringNoodle,But then you'll be bored because you're already god tier
04-04-2020T17:32:05,KeefMcDerpface,lol
04-04-2020T17:32:06,ThingsAreMoving,"lol Rough, don't skip your life."
04-04-2020T17:32:19,Roughlandin,I will never be bored with the ability to draw infinite lewds

04-04-2020T17:32:53,ThingsAreMoving,Thanks Mippy. I'm gathering all the useful tips. Like the other day Sage mentioned most people do one of the worst mistakes when they start learning how to draw: drawing small.
04-04-2020T17:33:10,xcvb,"welp, tracing is one thing and reference photos are another"

04-04-2020T17:33:57,ThingsAreMoving,"Yeah, now I'm trying to actually use the entire page for each sketch just to get into habit of drawing big"

04-04-2020T17:34:45,Avolendi,Hmmm. Should probably do a good focus on what I want to do for fun more. Since I tend to be chaotic and revert to trudging through on willpower (which is still half-assed)
