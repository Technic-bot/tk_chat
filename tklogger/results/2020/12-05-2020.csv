12-05-2020T04:43:16,Dadrobit,"Wait, no, just felt like 4 hours, 2 and a half. I'm tired, can't math."

12-05-2020T14:27:39,Twokinds,I posted today to make up for the missing one last week.
12-05-2020T14:27:49,Twokinds,There'll be another one at the regular time on Saturday.
12-05-2020T14:28:11,CrimsonQuill,Good Evening all
12-05-2020T14:28:13,CrimsonQuill,Hi Tom
12-05-2020T14:28:18,JojoGD,hi quill

12-05-2020T14:31:09,JojoGD,Now you don't have to go and buy it.
12-05-2020T14:31:32,CrimsonQuill,"JESUS CHRIST, that was too close"
12-05-2020T14:32:13,CrimsonQuill,WAY too close.
12-05-2020T14:32:34,CrimsonQuill,"...You're really dropping the feels in right away, eh Tom? Aheheh...."
12-05-2020T14:32:39,JojoGD,he almost snapped
12-05-2020T14:32:52,CrimsonQuill,"Dear God, I could write an essay about this comic...or a dozen"
12-05-2020T14:33:04,CrimsonQuill,Thank God Flora was able to help.
12-05-2020T14:33:12,IronHorseComics,the fact that he hasn't proves to me that he's grown more than I think even Euchre has realized
12-05-2020T14:33:50,CrimsonQuill,"I think that what we might see is a battle in the centre of the mind...and the two sides merging, in a new way."
12-05-2020T14:33:55,CrimsonQuill,But not without a cost.
12-05-2020T14:34:02,CrimsonQuill,Nothing comes without cost.
12-05-2020T14:34:15,CrimsonQuill,"The question is...what will that cost be, with whatever happens?"
12-05-2020T14:34:28,IronHorseComics,"oohhhh a battle in the mindscape. Trace if you find a triangle guy with a top hat, do NOT make any deals with him, he is bad juju"
12-05-2020T14:36:07,CrRAR,Triangle man with the triangular plan
12-05-2020T14:37:39,CrimsonQuill,"Excellent work on the page, Tom. Very emotional..."
12-05-2020T14:37:43,CrimsonQuill,Very well done
12-05-2020T14:48:26,Roughlandin,Methinks that mysterious portrait that's been covered up in the backgroud is about to come into play somehow...
12-05-2020T14:50:13,CrimsonQuill,Perhaps an impression of what the family would be...or a painting of their wedding.
12-05-2020T14:50:16,CrimsonQuill,"Also, hello Rough"
12-05-2020T14:50:21,ItsYaBoiFury,merp

12-05-2020T14:59:23,CrimsonQuill,I'm...trying to figure out whether to give myself rage over Halo Reach Legendary...or to watch Top Gear
12-05-2020T14:59:38,Mediawatcher,"This is just the beginning, I can only imagine how the rest of the chapter will be like"
12-05-2020T14:59:42,CrimsonQuill,Given that tomorrow is all study
12-05-2020T15:00:05,CrimsonQuill,@MediaWatcher Flora was right to be afraid of Trace's other side coming out here.
12-05-2020T15:00:14,Mediawatcher,Undeniably
12-05-2020T15:00:32,Mediawatcher,Oh man tom what are gonna put us through.
12-05-2020T15:00:35,Mediawatcher,?
12-05-2020T15:00:38,CrimsonQuill,"I don't want any characters to die, but I feel like it is going to happen."

12-05-2020T15:01:03,Mediawatcher,I‚Äôm frightened about that too! I feel like someone is gonna die! Tom you monster!
12-05-2020T15:01:17,CrimsonQuill,No...Tom you magnificent bastard
12-05-2020T15:01:24,Mediawatcher,That chicken is a perfect representation
12-05-2020T15:01:28,IronHorseComics,:cironhorsecomics-ZoeySurprised:
12-05-2020T15:01:39,CrimsonQuill,"Well, as much as i don't want anyone to die.."
12-05-2020T15:01:58,JojoGD,Tom may kill one of his character
12-05-2020T15:01:59,CrimsonQuill,The troper in me feels that it would ram home the themes of how lives can be destroyed by trauma and racism
12-05-2020T15:02:07,Mediawatcher,"I don‚Äôt want anyone to die, but looks like that‚Äôs what‚Äôs gonna happen"
12-05-2020T15:02:12,CrimsonQuill,"Damn you, TV tropes, for making me this way."
12-05-2020T15:02:16,Mediawatcher,That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm constantly fearing jojo
12-05-2020T15:02:36,JojoGD,Imagine if tom kills flora
12-05-2020T15:02:38,Mediawatcher,What makes it worse is that we don‚Äôt know who
12-05-2020T15:02:51,CrimsonQuill,"We will have to wait and see, accept it, and move on."
12-05-2020T15:03:02,Mediawatcher,"Yeah I know, I‚Äôm preparing for that"
12-05-2020T15:03:23,Mediawatcher,I was heartbroken over laura and now I‚Äôm gonna go through that all over again
12-05-2020T15:03:32,CrimsonQuill,"'I know what it's like to spend my life chasing ghosts' Epsilon, Red vs Blue series 10"
12-05-2020T15:03:54,CrimsonQuill,I keep seeing parallels between Twokinds and Red vs Blue.
12-05-2020T15:03:57,Mediawatcher,The wait is so frustrating but I‚Äôm so hyped!
12-05-2020T15:04:10,CrimsonQuill,"Seriously, Trace is a cross between the Director, Sharkface and Carolina at the moment."
12-05-2020T15:04:18,CrimsonQuill,At least...his evil side.
12-05-2020T15:04:30,Mediawatcher,Tom is going all out this chapter
12-05-2020T15:04:36,CrimsonQuill,"""He kept trying...he kept trying to get her right"""
12-05-2020T15:04:38,Mediawatcher,We all better prepare
12-05-2020T15:04:53,CrimsonQuill,I am just waiting for the door to open..
12-05-2020T15:04:58,Mediawatcher,Who‚Äôs gonna kick the bucket?

12-05-2020T15:05:31,CrimsonQuill,"Trace himself might end up dying, who knows?"
12-05-2020T15:06:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Flora could always find the magic newspaper and factory rest trace
12-05-2020T15:06:03,CrimsonQuill,"Or Roselyn, or Maren, Reni, Raine, Flora, Keith or Natani..."
12-05-2020T15:06:06,SpazztasticKiwi,reset
12-05-2020T15:06:14,CrimsonQuill,Evening Spazz
12-05-2020T15:06:22,Mediawatcher,Anyone of them could end up gone by this chapter!
12-05-2020T15:06:50,Mediawatcher,Who‚Äôs to say it‚Äôll just be one?
12-05-2020T15:06:56,Mediawatcher,Ok I need to calm down!
12-05-2020T15:07:12,JojoGD,What if it's more than one that takes the L
12-05-2020T15:07:32,Mediawatcher,I‚Äôm scared of that too!
12-05-2020T15:07:37,CrimsonQuill,...
12-05-2020T15:07:43,Mediawatcher,Who‚Äôs to say he‚Äôll stop at one?
12-05-2020T15:08:03,SpazztasticKiwi,or pull what they did with the final act & separate traces possession and kill it
12-05-2020T15:08:17,CrimsonQuill,"Tom, it's your comic. Whoever lives and survives, we'll accept. The Die is Cast."
12-05-2020T15:08:37,CrimsonQuill,Even if it's our favourite character/characters.
12-05-2020T15:08:39,CrimsonQuill,...
12-05-2020T15:08:55,CrimsonQuill,I'm scared. Very scared. But I'm braced.
12-05-2020T15:09:14,Mediawatcher,"I‚Äôll be really sad but I‚Äôll accept it but I‚Äôll be heartbroken, toms choice obviously but I‚Äôm so scared my favorite character will die, we have to prepare for impact!"
12-05-2020T15:09:27,Mediawatcher,And then accept whoever it is
12-05-2020T15:10:20,JojoGD,Im prepared to accept who ever dies
12-05-2020T15:10:46,Mediawatcher,So am i
12-05-2020T15:11:13,CrimsonQuill,"I confess, the ones I am most fearful for are Trace, Nat, Flora, Keith, Raine, Maren and Roselyn."
12-05-2020T15:11:27,CrimsonQuill,They all are in the DANGER ZONE
12-05-2020T15:11:36,Mediawatcher,I think maren and sythe are the most likely to end this chapter
12-05-2020T15:11:47,CrimsonQuill,"The ones I'd personally be most devastated at are Raine, Trace, Flora, Keith and Nat"
12-05-2020T15:11:49,Mediawatcher,But I could be wrong
12-05-2020T15:11:56,CrimsonQuill,"We shall see.,"
12-05-2020T15:12:00,CrimsonQuill,We shall see in time
12-05-2020T15:12:05,JojoGD,Only time can teel
12-05-2020T15:12:08,Mediawatcher,It‚Äôll be worth the wait
12-05-2020T15:12:09,JojoGD,tell
12-05-2020T15:12:16,Mediawatcher,I‚Äôm excited and scared at the same time!
12-05-2020T15:12:47,JojoGD,imagine if tom just kills off everyone. Probably not going to happen
12-05-2020T15:13:10,Mediawatcher,We obviously won‚Äôt be getting that but just losing one of them would be devastating
12-05-2020T15:14:09,CrimsonHelsing,"@TwoKinds what does Trace mean, that even his old self doesn't want to be there? Does he mean that room in particular?"
12-05-2020T15:14:54,CrimsonQuill,@CrimsonHelsing I think he means that even his old self can't bear the pain of the memories associated with that room.
12-05-2020T15:15:22,Twokinds,"Old Trace doesn't want to remember this. It's bad memories for him too, so he's not keen on breaking out and restoring himself at this very moment."
12-05-2020T15:15:38,CrimsonQuill,"If anything, that's even more worrying."
12-05-2020T15:15:56,JojoGD,it brings him bad memories
12-05-2020T15:16:16,CrimsonHelsing,"Ahh, would rather forget his lost parenthood? I see. I don't blame him, some memories are too painful to tolerate"
12-05-2020T15:16:17,CrimsonQuill,"It shows that the Old Trace might choose another moment to strike. And this time, even Flora might not be able to help prevent it."
12-05-2020T15:16:34,CrimsonQuill,And that the personality is growing...seeking a way out...
12-05-2020T15:16:43,CrimsonQuill,Perhaps it could become a seperate entity altogether.
12-05-2020T15:17:10,CrimsonQuill,"Heck, perhaps whatever is in the Rose Doors IS a fragment of Trace's old self, a la the AI fragments in Halo"
12-05-2020T15:17:40,CrimsonQuill,"A part that triggers a catalyst...merging with Trace's evil side inside of him, and causing an INCREDIBLY strong breakout."
12-05-2020T15:17:42,CrimsonHelsing,"I'd imagine he might separate from his own body at some point. When that happens, he's fair game"
12-05-2020T15:18:21,CrimsonHelsing,Like extricating Mr. Hyde from Dr. Jekyll
12-05-2020T15:19:06,Mediawatcher,I get the feeling his old self will separate from him at some point
12-05-2020T15:20:06,CrimsonQuill,"Oh-sorry to change the subject, but Tom, is it okay if I post a fanart link here? I just remembered."
12-05-2020T15:20:21,CrimsonQuill,It's the RvB/Twokinds crossover oneshot
12-05-2020T15:22:10,johnnytho,"Woah, was not expecting a comic update today"
12-05-2020T15:23:39,JojoGD,same
12-05-2020T15:35:09,CrimsonHelsing,"Oh yeah, forgot one more question @Twokinds, *can* that window be broken if anyone wanted to use that to escape? Or would it just magically repair itself?"
12-05-2020T15:35:44,CrimsonHelsing,Like in The Haunted Mansion
12-05-2020T15:37:53,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt know if you should be tagging him so much
12-05-2020T15:37:58,SpazztasticKiwi,he could be working
12-05-2020T15:38:28,CrimsonHelsing,"Right, of course."
12-05-2020T15:38:42,CrimsonQuill,Are there any moderators in chat at the moment?
12-05-2020T15:38:55,CrimsonQuill,Because I need permission for some fanart linking
12-05-2020T15:39:04,CrimsonQuill,"Or rather, I would like permission"
12-05-2020T15:39:14,CrimsonQuill,Please
12-05-2020T15:39:21,CrimsonQuill,To link a fanart I did
12-05-2020T15:39:25,JojoGD,0 mods but tom as of now
12-05-2020T15:39:46,CrimsonQuill,"I see...well, if Tom's busy atm it's fine"
12-05-2020T15:40:15,CrimsonQuill,Saw some Cormorants and an Egret yesterday when I was at the seafront.
12-05-2020T15:40:17,CrimsonQuill,And some herons.
12-05-2020T15:40:23,CrimsonQuill,That walk was worth it.
12-05-2020T15:40:52,johnnytho,You a birder?
12-05-2020T15:40:53,CrimsonHelsing,"I kinda hope Trace and Flora take a little bit to settle down in that room, there might still be something useful in there, maybe."
12-05-2020T15:41:15,JojoGD,i hardly go outside. Even before Covid-19
12-05-2020T15:41:24,CrimsonQuill,I would go out more.
12-05-2020T15:41:32,CrimsonQuill,But I suffer chronic computer addiction.
12-05-2020T15:42:02,johnnytho,"All my trails are closed, season got canned, otherwise everything is normal"
12-05-2020T15:42:35,SpazztasticKiwi,that‚Äôs often a case of bad self discipline
12-05-2020T15:43:05,CrimsonQuill,I have very bad self discipline.
12-05-2020T15:43:27,JojoGD,I would like to go walk behind the SDCC
12-05-2020T15:43:32,CrimsonQuill,"I'm working on it, but it's the cause of most of my life problems, and by extension my regular emotional breakdowns."
12-05-2020T15:43:54,JojoGD,Too bad there's construction nearby and 0 parking
12-05-2020T15:44:06,JojoGD,near the SDCC
12-05-2020T15:45:02,CrimsonQuill,You're right near SDCC?
12-05-2020T15:45:10,CrimsonQuill,"As in, the Comic Con place?"
12-05-2020T15:46:31,JojoGD,San Diego Convention Center. Its a 12 min drive from where i live
12-05-2020T15:46:51,CrimsonQuill,You are so lucky
12-05-2020T15:47:00,CrimsonQuill,You are right on the doorstep for the cons
12-05-2020T15:47:11,CrimsonQuill,I'd have to pay ‚Ç¨1000 just for a flight
12-05-2020T15:47:14,JojoGD,Its noisy in the night because of Nasco
12-05-2020T15:48:02,JojoGD,Because of the trains
12-05-2020T15:48:21,JojoGD,Which made me realize i haven't heard them in a while
12-05-2020T15:49:03,CrimsonQuill,The lockdown does that.
12-05-2020T15:49:47,JojoGD,The last time i went fishing was behind the convention center
12-05-2020T15:51:36,JojoGD,It was nice one time because i was able to hear the Symphony play music while fishing
