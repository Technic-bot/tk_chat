20-06-2020T01:10:05,SpazztasticKiwi,they‚Äôre either in danger themselves or to others
20-06-2020T01:10:21,RimaDraws,i can't drink because of my depression so that's good enough reason
20-06-2020T01:10:24,SpazztasticKiwi,some are annoying but it cycles right back to endangering themselves
20-06-2020T01:10:28,RimaDraws,plus ive made myself a fool before
20-06-2020T01:10:49,SpazztasticKiwi,‚Äúhey watch me jump out in front of this car - they‚Äôll stop‚Äù

20-06-2020T01:14:59,AspiringNoodle,"Good lord, apparently these 24 - 25 oz cans @ 8% alcohol / volume are the equivalent of 3 standard drinks O_o"
20-06-2020T01:15:00,SpazztasticKiwi,or to make sure an alcoholic is actually quitting instead of drinking when the social workers area around
20-06-2020T01:15:09,SpazztasticKiwi,aren‚Äôt
20-06-2020T01:15:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"that‚Äôs nice - personal matter, keep it there"
20-06-2020T01:15:57,AspiringNoodle,Just doing some quick math to get a ball park of my BAC
20-06-2020T01:16:24,SpazztasticKiwi,walk to the nearest police station & ask for a breathalyzer
20-06-2020T01:17:22,SpazztasticKiwi,anyhoo - did you name Karen with her personality to be opposite of a Karen or was it more ‚ÄúI‚Äôm out of names so here/why not‚Äù
20-06-2020T01:17:30,RimaDraws,why do you care about drinking? its not healthy
20-06-2020T01:18:19,SpazztasticKiwi,have you worked on any new art stuff lately?

20-06-2020T01:21:05,AspiringNoodle,"According to these calculators, given my body weight and the amount I've had to drink (factoring in when I started), my BAC probably breached 0.08%"
20-06-2020T01:21:18,AspiringNoodle,What was the cosplay?
20-06-2020T01:21:31,SpazztasticKiwi,there wasn‚Äôt one

20-06-2020T01:23:07,AspiringNoodle,"Also, what was the content of the video?"
20-06-2020T01:23:34,RimaDraws,probably for senior year memories
20-06-2020T01:24:03,SpazztasticKiwi,school music video
20-06-2020T01:24:07,SpazztasticKiwi,no class day

20-06-2020T01:24:31,AspiringNoodle,"Also, you know how every single piece of media ever loves living up the ""high school rivalry"" from decades passed?"
20-06-2020T01:24:40,SpazztasticKiwi,ran around dancing to a boom box carried around by someone behind the camera
20-06-2020T01:25:07,AspiringNoodle,"We legit had one of those rivalry moments back when I was in high school, lol"
20-06-2020T01:25:12,SpazztasticKiwi,the most uncoordinated day of life you can have at a hs
20-06-2020T01:25:35,RimaDraws,^^
20-06-2020T01:25:42,AspiringNoodle,"I would honestly think that's the mini-thon my school has yearly, lol"
20-06-2020T01:25:57,AspiringNoodle,Straight 8-hours of being locked in for charity
20-06-2020T01:26:02,SpazztasticKiwi,dress code was often suspended so you had some people (cough cough me) show in slippers with their look
20-06-2020T01:26:13,AspiringNoodle,"Plenty of activities to do, but don't you dare fall asleep!"
20-06-2020T01:26:38,SpazztasticKiwi,concrete floors and slippers...

20-06-2020T01:26:59,SpazztasticKiwi,fuzzy slippers
20-06-2020T01:27:09,AspiringNoodle,Um... uh...
20-06-2020T01:27:12,AspiringNoodle,I got nothing
20-06-2020T01:28:13,SpazztasticKiwi,and we had 6 sets of stairs

20-06-2020T01:28:34,AspiringNoodle,Dang
20-06-2020T01:29:29,AspiringNoodle,"Btw, Rima, thanks for saying something earlier"
20-06-2020T01:31:27,AspiringNoodle,Didn't realize how big these drinks truly are
20-06-2020T01:31:54,RimaDraws,after  my hangover i hardly drank again
20-06-2020T01:32:04,AspiringNoodle,I also now have a frame of reference for what *drunk* feels like
20-06-2020T01:32:39,SpazztasticKiwi,unus annus....Marks neighbor kid yelling ‚Äúhelp me‚Äù in the bg as he tries to throw a paper airplane
20-06-2020T01:32:44,AspiringNoodle,lol
20-06-2020T01:32:57,AspiringNoodle,I think the first unus annus video I got recommended was a rather recent one
20-06-2020T01:32:58,SpazztasticKiwi,example of what we all feel during this whole endeavor
20-06-2020T01:33:05,AspiringNoodle,"""Building ikea furniture without instructions"""
20-06-2020T01:33:15,AspiringNoodle,The absolute mad lads

20-06-2020T01:34:17,AspiringNoodle,"Well, according to the calculator, I got a good while before I'm completely sober again ._."
20-06-2020T01:35:01,RimaDraws,how many have you had? because its one hour per drink
20-06-2020T01:35:23,AspiringNoodle,"If the math is right, ~4.4"
20-06-2020T01:35:27,RimaDraws,yea
20-06-2020T01:35:35,AspiringNoodle,1 drink of 16 oz @ 5% and 1 of 23.5 oz @ 8%
20-06-2020T01:35:43,SpazztasticKiwi,I mean some people don‚Äôt listen & gotta learn
20-06-2020T01:35:47,AspiringNoodle,My BAC should be around .065%
20-06-2020T01:36:27,AspiringNoodle,"Sooooo, it's entirely possible I hit the legal intoxication limit at some point"
20-06-2020T01:36:32,RimaDraws,if you're that much a lightweight you're gonna feel that in the morning
20-06-2020T01:36:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"after telling Timmy don‚Äôt pee on the electric fence, wait for him to do it anyway"
20-06-2020T01:36:39,AspiringNoodle,Lol
20-06-2020T01:36:43,SpazztasticKiwi,"‚Äúah well, you‚Äôll learn‚Äù"
20-06-2020T01:36:47,RimaDraws,lol
20-06-2020T01:37:04,AspiringNoodle,"It's my fault, anyways"
20-06-2020T01:37:17,AspiringNoodle,Got some drinks I can go through like soda
20-06-2020T01:38:55,RimaDraws,no drink of alcohol should be gone through like soda. it's not meant to be like that. you'll get buzzed quicker that way. also if you don't eat something before drinking like that you'll be sicker than a dog
20-06-2020T01:39:08,AspiringNoodle,"Well, that's just the thing"
20-06-2020T01:39:16,AspiringNoodle,I was doing all this drinking with a rather sizable meal
20-06-2020T01:39:38,AspiringNoodle,Supposedly the calculator factored this in
20-06-2020T01:40:06,AspiringNoodle,I can only imagine how bad it would be if I didn't have as much to eat as I did
20-06-2020T01:41:46,RimaDraws,well i can tell you if you drank so much you might or might not have a hangover in the morning
20-06-2020T01:42:10,AspiringNoodle,"I swear, karma must exist"
20-06-2020T01:42:17,AspiringNoodle,"South Park is playing the addiction episode, lol"
20-06-2020T01:43:03,RimaDraws,oh no
20-06-2020T01:43:43,AspiringNoodle,You've seen it?
20-06-2020T01:44:09,AspiringNoodle,"Also, just because it's so funny"
20-06-2020T01:44:16,RimaDraws,no i can't remember much of south park
20-06-2020T01:45:20,AspiringNoodle,I don't wanna post it in chat because of the excessive amount of swearing
20-06-2020T01:45:39,SpazztasticKiwi,...yea..the swearing
20-06-2020T01:45:44,SpazztasticKiwi,that‚Äôs the problem
20-06-2020T01:47:31,AspiringNoodle,"Well, it's not the episode itself, there's a fake alcohol ad in it"
20-06-2020T01:47:37,AspiringNoodle,Gets a tad risque

20-06-2020T16:09:50,BadFoMo,...How about a pretzle?
20-06-2020T16:10:00,Roughlandin,She has become so flexible she is now a liquid. Draw her as a puddle
20-06-2020T16:10:02,Twokinds,And that isn't weird. A lot of them aren't very good

20-06-2020T16:10:37,NeonMitsumi,That's probably the joke.
20-06-2020T16:10:42,Roughlandin,What if she's doing yoga... while EATING pretzels?
20-06-2020T16:10:44,Rulo6000,something of aerial dancing could work
20-06-2020T16:10:45,MarvTheHugPharaoh,A pose that would make Kat worry about Flora's spine?

20-06-2020T17:20:28,KeefMcDerpface,:eyes:

20-06-2020T20:42:53,Ordithus,he did help Raine and Mary escape from an ill fate
20-06-2020T20:42:53,Dadrobit,"Nah, Tom mentioned before that he had no idea. Had he known, he'd have never helped Trace."

20-06-2020T20:43:35,Ordithus,So he found out about 4 years ago?

20-06-2020T20:51:29,DarthKeidran,I actually now legitimately want to know now: Did he think his perfect transformation was flawed enough to prevent having a child? Did he just not know Mary would be due for a period soon? Was Mary actually trying for a child and he claimed impotence?
20-06-2020T20:51:40,FenceEqualizer,Now if Raine could somehow reconnect with her mother.
20-06-2020T20:51:42,Ordithus,he never got the talk
