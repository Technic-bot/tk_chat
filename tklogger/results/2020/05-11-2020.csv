05-11-2020T00:56:08,AspiringNoodle,This is likely to be a very drawn out election.  Tensions are going to soar.  I have enough on my mind with COVID.

05-11-2020T06:51:31,CrRAR,they waitin for all the wagers to be in

05-11-2020T08:26:22,Dadrobit,Reminder that Bush v Gore took like 37 days to finalize. Buckle up for some serious Republican ratfuckery once again.
05-11-2020T08:43:55,CrRAR,lol
05-11-2020T08:44:43,CrRAR,"I do remember that, I remember a lot of anticipation that they would recount or something in FL"
05-11-2020T08:44:56,CrRAR,Did they actually ever though?
05-11-2020T08:50:56,Dadrobit,"No, Bush's legal team went to the SCOTUS to stop Florida from a recount."
05-11-2020T08:51:48,CrRAR,"ah okay, makes sense"
05-11-2020T08:52:28,Dadrobit,"(Not so) Fun Fact! John Roberts, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett were all on Bush's legal team. They are now all Supreme Court Justices. So if anyone was even a little bit confused as to why Barrett got rammed through, there ya go."
05-11-2020T08:52:37,CrRAR,yeah I remember the news stories being like it was a last ditch effort by Gore
05-11-2020T08:52:50,CrRAR,yuppp
05-11-2020T08:53:22,CrRAR,"tbh, there's so many battlegrounds rn, it's not one state that Trump would have to steal back"
05-11-2020T08:53:34,CrRAR,PA supposedly just flipped
05-11-2020T08:53:48,Dadrobit,Also Florida's governor was Bush's brither.
05-11-2020T08:53:54,Dadrobit,brother*
05-11-2020T08:54:00,CrRAR,Course a slim margin isn't necessarily a win
05-11-2020T08:54:05,CrRAR,"Oh, Jeb?"
05-11-2020T08:54:13,CrRAR,or is there another?
05-11-2020T08:54:23,CrRAR,I do remember that mentioned.
05-11-2020T08:55:03,CrRAR,"shoot, Biden up by 23500 in PA rn due to a big release batch"
05-11-2020T08:55:13,Dadrobit,And it was more of a last ditch effort from Bush more than Gore. Gore had just won several states and was up on electroal votes. He was at 267 to Bush's 246.
05-11-2020T08:55:22,Dadrobit,"Yeah, it was Jeb"
05-11-2020T08:55:24,CrRAR,homestate FTW lol

05-11-2020T08:56:36,CrRAR,yeah but the east states are worth lots more.
05-11-2020T08:56:49,Dadrobit,"For sure, AZ is only 11."
05-11-2020T08:56:58,Dadrobit,But fuck me do I want it to stay Blue.
05-11-2020T08:57:00,CrRAR,20 pa votes I think Trump is screwed
05-11-2020T08:57:33,CrRAR,"Yeah, tbh, based on what you said about sentiment there I been holding out hope for Blue there too"
05-11-2020T08:58:04,Dadrobit,Turns out that badmouthing war hero senators is a bad idea.
05-11-2020T08:58:20,CrRAR,"NV was Blue last election, but I was afraid how LV views being closed due to corona."
05-11-2020T08:58:26,CrRAR,Yeah
05-11-2020T08:58:36,CrRAR,In mass Baker HATES Trump
05-11-2020T08:58:56,Dadrobit,And McSally is so fucking detested here that she managed to flip BOTH senate seats blue in only two years lmfao
05-11-2020T08:59:04,CrRAR,He said in an October 30th press conference he would not vote for trump
05-11-2020T08:59:31,CrRAR,The messaging has been straight hatred as far as he's concerned
05-11-2020T09:00:05,CrRAR,"Yeah senate will be interesting, there's a chance a runoff in GA will flip a seat in Jan"
05-11-2020T09:00:31,CrRAR,It's too close so basically they eliminate the 3rd party and revote to determine a winner
05-11-2020T09:00:57,Dadrobit,"I'm not holding my breath, but it would be lovely."
05-11-2020T09:01:06,CrRAR,"Also, gotta remember a special privilege of being VP is a vote in the senate"
05-11-2020T09:01:21,Dadrobit,"If the senate is split, then VP Harris gets to act as the deciding vote in split decisions."
05-11-2020T09:01:24,Dadrobit,Yep
05-11-2020T09:01:32,CrRAR,So it may very well be a fair and rational Senate
05-11-2020T09:01:50,Dadrobit,Rational being a subjective term.
05-11-2020T09:02:01,CrRAR,so true xD
05-11-2020T09:02:47,CrRAR,"there are totally some not-extremist repubs in there that will work intelligently on things, same w/ democrats."
05-11-2020T09:04:05,Dadrobit,"I'm sorry, I'm just so fucking elated we got rid of McSally. She was one of those extremists. During her campaign, she literally said, ""I know times are tough and money is tight, so if you don't have money to donate right now, just start skipping meals!"""
05-11-2020T09:04:42,Dadrobit,"Like, go fuuuuuuck yourself you fucking benchwarmer."
05-11-2020T09:05:42,Dadrobit,Hopefully she runs for Governor so we can get a trifecta of Blue reps
05-11-2020T09:08:18,CrRAR,"yeah, see that's the core thing wrong with that mentality, America has great chance for reward (prosperity) BECAUSE of the social divide."
05-11-2020T09:08:54,CrRAR,They are literally saying that the disadvantaged need to give up MORE because the weather end needs more
05-11-2020T09:09:09,CrRAR,Which will only lead to social unrest
05-11-2020T09:09:20,CrRAR,Which is exactly what's happening
05-11-2020T09:09:37,Dadrobit,Which they then try to gaslight people into believing it's all the left's fault.
05-11-2020T09:09:49,CrRAR,*weather = wealthy
05-11-2020T09:09:53,CrRAR,yup
05-11-2020T09:10:55,CrRAR,"That's why too Trump believes in arming people up and the gun lobby and police, because it will create a society of higher crime where you will have to be more protective"
05-11-2020T09:11:19,CrRAR,But who wants to live in a damn warzone?
05-11-2020T09:11:27,CrRAR,srsly
05-11-2020T09:12:02,Dadrobit,Y'All Qaeda
05-11-2020T09:12:24,CrRAR,lol
05-11-2020T09:12:32,CrRAR,"I think people just take for granted the actual comfort provided by the balance gov't provides I guess, if that vanishes, all hell will break loose"
05-11-2020T09:17:37,Dadrobit,It's not exactly comforting to see what's happening down here at the counting centers. Not an insignificant number of Trump supporters showed up with rifles and then Alex Jones of all people joins them out of nowhere.
05-11-2020T09:17:59,CrRAR,lol
05-11-2020T09:18:12,Dadrobit,"The center managed to push them back far enough to put up a gate, but it's barely more than chicken wire."
05-11-2020T09:18:24,CrRAR,I did hear another story of some prolific person being amongst another group somewhere
05-11-2020T09:18:33,CrRAR,Yeah it's tense
05-11-2020T09:19:17,CrRAR,"Guy I know at work is a selectman with polling duties and he explained all the controls in place, it's pretty crazy"
05-11-2020T09:19:46,CrRAR,There are literally reps from both Conventions there to observe like big brother.
05-11-2020T09:20:02,CrRAR,Plus the polling staff oversight
05-11-2020T09:20:26,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I read an article about it. They needed oversight as well making sure none of the reps touched anything on either side."
05-11-2020T09:21:06,CrRAR,"I mean stuff can still happen, but I guess like football or something, one side gets away with a no-call penalty, the other side probably will too"
05-11-2020T09:22:33,Dadrobit,"I'd rather neither does, can we get an instant replay please lol."
05-11-2020T09:23:26,CrRAR,true lol
05-11-2020T09:24:13,CrRAR,Just the idea of a recount anywhere cuz if the scale and coordination must suck
05-11-2020T09:24:20,CrRAR,*of
05-11-2020T09:24:35,Dadrobit,I guarantee recounts are going to happen. There's no way there won't be.
05-11-2020T09:24:41,CrRAR,I totally understand the hesitation to go through it all again
05-11-2020T09:24:50,CrRAR,yeah
05-11-2020T09:25:20,CrRAR,I feel like if you do one recount there should automatically be a 3rd
05-11-2020T09:25:38,CrRAR,Cuz then you can see which recount was closest
05-11-2020T09:25:47,CrRAR,like 2/3 xD

05-11-2020T09:33:59,CrRAR,It's crazy
05-11-2020T09:34:15,CrRAR,That was just hilarious to me
05-11-2020T09:34:29,Dadrobit,Chris Christie?
05-11-2020T09:34:36,CrRAR,Yeahhhp

05-11-2020T09:35:25,CrRAR,It was just a couple days ago it happened
05-11-2020T09:35:26,Dadrobit,Even Mittens won't go against Trump on this
05-11-2020T09:35:39,CrRAR,They have been pretty silent
05-11-2020T09:35:52,CrRAR,"but silence speaks, too"

05-11-2020T09:36:20,Dadrobit,"He spoke on it. Said, ""We'll count the votes first, then we'll look for any fraud"""

05-11-2020T09:37:38,CrRAR,"Oh, ohio, nvm"
05-11-2020T09:39:24,CrRAR,"there was that whole Lincoln project thing too, which was a Repub initiative against Trump."
05-11-2020T09:39:36,CrRAR,More just the moderate folks
05-11-2020T09:43:08,Dadrobit,I wonder how much the Lincoln Project actually did. Cut 70 million people still somehow voted for the guy. So was there an appreciable effect? Or was it just cathartic to anyone who was paying attention?

05-11-2020T18:19:54,CrimsonQuill,We're learning about some sort of directional differentiation
05-11-2020T18:19:59,CrimsonQuill,stresses
05-11-2020T18:20:28,NinoGD,covid math problems really
05-11-2020T18:21:30,CrRAR,Real world application math is appreciated
05-11-2020T18:21:45,CrRAR,"But too real math teacher, TOO REAL"
05-11-2020T18:21:47,CrimsonQuill,Maths is INCREDIBLY Difficult for me.
05-11-2020T18:21:48,CrimsonQuill,But..
05-11-2020T18:21:56,CrimsonQuill,When I finally understand it..
05-11-2020T18:22:03,CrimsonQuill,It's like watching the stream.
05-11-2020T18:22:08,CrimsonQuill,It's just....beautiful.

05-11-2020T18:23:32,CrRAR,lol
05-11-2020T18:24:04,CrimsonQuill,I have a GIS (Geospatial Information Systems) project...
05-11-2020T18:24:26,CrimsonQuill,A GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite Systems)/Geodetic Surveying project...
05-11-2020T18:24:41,CrimsonQuill,And a Land and Marine management project.
05-11-2020T18:24:47,CrRAR,I once found “A brief History of Time” once in my High School library and thought I found like a mythical text xD
05-11-2020T18:24:57,CrRAR,At least I think that was the book
05-11-2020T18:25:06,CrimsonQuill,My aunt got me 'The Universe in a Nutshell' one christmas.
05-11-2020T18:25:15,CrRAR,If I can find the cover of the edition I had I would know
05-11-2020T18:25:16,CrimsonQuill,It was such a beautiful read.
05-11-2020T18:26:05,CrRAR,"Yeah, it covered like the properties of how gravity effects the spacetime fabric and doppler effect like light’s properties and such"
05-11-2020T18:27:13,CrRAR,Like the old clock experiment something about you drop a clock or something and somehow anoher clock is involved and because gravity dilates time one loses a fraction second
05-11-2020T18:28:24,CrRAR,...and the physics of matter near a black hole. Like how it effects things closer to it individually kinda likr magnitism in how strength drops off quickly from the event horizon.
05-11-2020T18:28:37,CrimsonQuill,I loved his black hole stuff.
05-11-2020T18:28:49,CrRAR,That’s why spahgettification happens
05-11-2020T18:29:01,CrimsonQuill,Universe in a Nutshell talked about the M branes and the planck scale constant
05-11-2020T18:30:14,NinoGD,My dumbass rushed it
05-11-2020T18:30:17,CrRAR,"Ah, yeah it’s funny trying to keep concepts names linked to the concepts"
05-11-2020T18:30:46,CrRAR,The only thing that stuck in my head from normal physics is the Bernoulli Principle
05-11-2020T18:31:10,CrRAR,Like that high flow rate creates lift/attraction
05-11-2020T18:31:24,CrRAR,"Like around an wing, or even in water"
05-11-2020T18:31:52,CrimsonQuill,Physics is amazing...
05-11-2020T18:32:12,CrRAR,Basically the reason if you run a current between two things that the things will drift together due to pressure
05-11-2020T18:33:44,CrimsonQuill,Is that because of the compression of particles? Maybe making a sort of 'pushback' effect?
05-11-2020T18:37:16,CrRAR,I think it’s lower pressure draws things toward the lower pressure
05-11-2020T18:37:34,CrRAR,Which is crazy when you think of it applying to flight I guess
05-11-2020T18:37:59,CrRAR,Though really a plane is just a VERY complicated conversion of forces
05-11-2020T18:38:25,CrRAR,Forward force converts to upward because it generates lower pressure above the wings
05-11-2020T18:38:26,CrimsonQuill,Wow...
05-11-2020T18:38:55,CrRAR,Like it’s almost like a seconday “reaction” occurring at the wings
05-11-2020T18:39:28,CrimsonQuill,Wait a second...wasn't the bernoulli theorem somewhat disproven?
05-11-2020T18:39:35,CrRAR,Was it?
05-11-2020T18:39:46,CrRAR,It’s on wikipedia
05-11-2020T18:40:03,CrRAR,https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli%27s_principle
05-11-2020T18:40:18,CrRAR,How it APPLIES to flight is more complicated
05-11-2020T18:40:22,CrimsonQuill,I found a few articles saying scientists don't know how it's possible
05-11-2020T18:40:27,CrimsonQuill,I am probably wrong
05-11-2020T18:40:44,CrRAR,"Cuz then there’s that thing about “then, why can planes fly upside down?”"
05-11-2020T18:41:08,CrRAR,Cuz when flying upside down the have to alter the angle-of-attack
05-11-2020T18:41:20,CrRAR,Which rejiggers the physics
05-11-2020T18:41:25,CrimsonQuill,"Oooh, that makes sense now."
05-11-2020T18:41:38,CrRAR,To create another bernoulli “reaction”
05-11-2020T18:42:38,CrRAR,Ah the book I was referencing was “Black Holes and Time Warps” by Kip Thorne
05-11-2020T18:43:02,CrRAR,It had a forword by Stephen Hawking
05-11-2020T18:43:19,CrRAR,I reccommend it if you like the other one
05-11-2020T18:43:48,CrimsonQuill,"Oooh, yes please"
05-11-2020T18:44:04,CrimsonQuill,I read that they became very good friends after the black hole bet.
05-11-2020T18:44:11,CrRAR,I’m pretty sure it was Kip Thorne that was the advisor on the Interstellar movie like space-time wormhole imagry
05-11-2020T18:44:26,CrimsonQuill,I have to watch interstellar.
05-11-2020T18:44:40,CrRAR,That part of the movie was actually made to try to be accurate to that kind of stuff
05-11-2020T18:45:07,CrRAR,"It was a entertaining movie, seemed more complicated than it was I think"
05-11-2020T18:45:27,CrRAR,The story is a simple one with a bunch of wacko physics strewn in
05-11-2020T18:45:43,CrimsonQuill,niiice
05-11-2020T18:45:53,CrRAR,"So it’s a crazy watch, but simple I think if you try to think into it"
05-11-2020T18:45:58,CrimsonQuill,Something I need after this helluva week
05-11-2020T18:46:49,CrRAR,"Yeah it was him, he was the advisor Christopher Nolan used"
05-11-2020T18:47:54,CrimsonQuill,:)
05-11-2020T18:48:09,CrRAR,"Yeah you’re right, he, Steve Hawking, and Carl Sagan looks like were buddies and colleagues."
05-11-2020T18:48:27,CrimsonQuill,I wish I could go out stargazing...
05-11-2020T18:48:35,CrimsonQuill,But the city lights ruin the sky.
05-11-2020T18:48:59,CrimsonQuill,"As soon as I have a weekend off, I'm going home and stargazing and seeing family"
05-11-2020T18:49:02,CrRAR,"The stars were great last night, I think it was last night here."
05-11-2020T18:49:08,CrimsonQuill,Ooooh
05-11-2020T18:49:13,SonOfGoku,I wish I still had access to my school's telescope
05-11-2020T18:49:26,CrRAR,Yeah you really gain an appreciation of the sky somewhere rural
05-11-2020T18:49:39,CrRAR,In the Carribbean the sky is amazing
05-11-2020T18:50:04,CrRAR,You don’t even realize how many stars there really are with all the lights
05-11-2020T18:50:47,CrRAR,"Like it’s so easy to spot shooting stars, they’re ever really more common than you think, they just get drowned out"
05-11-2020T18:51:47,CrimsonQuill,"I want to be at home this Christmas, stargazing, before walking down to bed and reading the comic (Again)."
05-11-2020T18:51:55,CrRAR,"Like, the way Tom does stars is how the sky looks with no light pollution xD"
05-11-2020T18:52:04,CrimsonQuill,Just magical

05-11-2020T18:54:02,CrRAR,"I forgot how I found the catalog, but there were some pretty neat ones"
05-11-2020T18:54:04,CrimsonQuill,Stars and maths and physics and stuff
05-11-2020T18:54:10,CrRAR,yus
05-11-2020T18:54:41,CrimsonQuill,"By the way, change of subject slightly, but did Tom say when Volume 5 might come out?"
05-11-2020T18:55:36,CrRAR,I think he was hoping by the holidays but I don’t know about if there’s delays or anything
05-11-2020T18:55:55,CrRAR,so nothing definitive
05-11-2020T18:56:40,CrRAR,"Nebulas can sometimes look like neurons, or brain shapes lol"
05-11-2020T18:56:56,CrRAR,Especially the bright glowy bits
05-11-2020T19:02:26,CrRAR,Yeah I might have to reborrow the Kip Thorne book again for old times’ sake
