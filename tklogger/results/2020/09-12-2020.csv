09-12-2020T16:52:44,SpazztasticKiwi,"and one thing for my mom to learn, you are not the “head of the household” only when it’s convenient or positive"
09-12-2020T16:52:54,CrRAR,How about like a chores board or assignment chart or something?
09-12-2020T16:53:06,SpazztasticKiwi,you’re delusional
09-12-2020T16:53:12,CrRAR,xD
09-12-2020T16:53:17,CrRAR,sorry
09-12-2020T16:53:56,CrRAR,"Yeah, sounds like 'head of household' is used to just pull rank?"
09-12-2020T16:54:11,CrRAR,Like those situations?
09-12-2020T16:54:27,CrRAR,):
09-12-2020T16:54:35,SpazztasticKiwi,and she doesn’t like it when I throw it right back at her that she best act like it
09-12-2020T16:54:57,SpazztasticKiwi,which includes when things are fine and when something needs attention
09-12-2020T16:55:36,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s not my job to take the reins when something happens and find what and who we need to fix it
09-12-2020T16:56:05,SpazztasticKiwi,yet she’s like “I’ll get to it later” or “it’s my house” when I start on it and actually show progress
09-12-2020T16:57:53,SpazztasticKiwi,you want something done? then hop on it & do it yourself or back tf down and let me do it
09-12-2020T16:59:50,CrRAR,"yeah, best you can do sounds like is just get away with doing what you can and learn from the situations and the bigger things you do do."
09-12-2020T17:00:05,CrRAR,The chores sharing stuff though is inexcusable.
09-12-2020T17:00:12,CrRAR,That's not fair
09-12-2020T17:00:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ll tell you the beginning of it all
09-12-2020T17:00:37,SpazztasticKiwi,my sisters NEVER picked up after herself
09-12-2020T17:00:41,CrRAR,Some people it just doesn't even occur to them it's untidy
09-12-2020T17:00:42,SpazztasticKiwi,E V E R
09-12-2020T17:01:10,CrRAR,"Yeah, nope, one of my brothers is line that."
09-12-2020T17:01:24,SpazztasticKiwi,"I used to do dishes, she did laundry, and usually she bagged the garbage & I’d take it out with my mother"
09-12-2020T17:01:25,CrRAR,"Cooks using a pan, filthy pan on the stove after"
09-12-2020T17:01:54,SpazztasticKiwi,but I put my foot down at one point and told my mother - the parent and “head adult/head of the household”
09-12-2020T17:01:55,CrRAR,"They're not even really bong inconsiderate, they DON'T CARE"
09-12-2020T17:02:05,CrRAR,*being
09-12-2020T17:02:24,CrRAR,"""Eh, well, I just live like this"""
09-12-2020T17:02:41,SpazztasticKiwi,"if she doesn’t start picking up her eggshells, food wrappers, opened drinks, used plates & dishes, I’m not doing the dishes for a week until it’s fixed"
09-12-2020T17:02:44,CrRAR,"""whats the problem?"" o:"
09-12-2020T17:03:09,CrRAR,"Oh yeah, eggshells. in. the. sink."
09-12-2020T17:03:22,SpazztasticKiwi,"then I’ll see if I’ll go back to it, IF she started continuing to clean up"
09-12-2020T17:03:50,SpazztasticKiwi,but she didn’t obviously so I never went back to doing the dishes
09-12-2020T17:03:59,SpazztasticKiwi,so she decided to stop doing laundry
09-12-2020T17:04:11,SpazztasticKiwi,and the snowball just kept downhill
09-12-2020T17:04:15,CrRAR,"I think it's important to realize it's not you, and she probably isn't doing it distinctly to spite you."
09-12-2020T17:04:28,CrRAR,It's just how they be.
09-12-2020T17:04:40,CrRAR,;_;
09-12-2020T17:05:48,CrRAR,"So, sadly you have no choice but to treat them like special people, try to maintain almost impossible patience"
09-12-2020T17:07:22,CrRAR,"You can be better, but yeah it totally sucks feeling like being taken advantage of."
09-12-2020T17:09:06,CrRAR,"You already proved that you're the stronger person, something that matters to who YOU are."
09-12-2020T17:15:25,CrRAR,Can you like take all her crap she leaves and like put the trashbag in/near her room.
09-12-2020T17:15:52,CrRAR,or would it just get ignored?
09-12-2020T17:16:41,SpazztasticKiwi,there’s a kitchen trash bag that’s been ignored for maybe this whole year because she refuses to take it
09-12-2020T17:16:44,SpazztasticKiwi,so guess
09-12-2020T17:17:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I have my trash in my room and my bathroom that I take every Sunday night so they pick it up Monday morning
09-12-2020T17:17:46,CrRAR,"yeah, easy to predict, trash man come, trash man go."
09-12-2020T17:19:18,CrRAR,"I would have to say I totally endorse the trailer idea, knowing all this."

09-12-2020T22:29:22,CrRAR,headache was bugging me a while earlier
09-12-2020T22:29:29,CrRAR,def sleep related
09-12-2020T22:33:24,SpazztasticKiwi,black friday candles and bombs are here
09-12-2020T22:34:13,SpazztasticKiwi,it took me two hours to write the email to fj because of all that happened with this shipment but the tiger conservation bombs smell 👌🏻
09-12-2020T22:34:30,SpazztasticKiwi,the gingerbread man one was awful
09-12-2020T22:45:42,CrRAR,too much gingery smell?
09-12-2020T22:45:58,CrRAR,I could see that being unpleasant
09-12-2020T22:46:24,CrRAR,Needs to be more sugary sweet if it's a cookie candle.
09-12-2020T22:47:01,CrRAR,sugar cookie candles are festive this time of year
09-12-2020T22:47:52,CrRAR,def an underrated scent

09-12-2020T23:04:45,CrRAR,hey blackjack
09-12-2020T23:05:02,CrRAR,yes pungent xD
09-12-2020T23:08:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t know exactly what the smell is but the closest I can think of is cheap chocolate
09-12-2020T23:08:36,SpazztasticKiwi,and it’s StRoNg
09-12-2020T23:10:16,SpazztasticKiwi,the mulled wine smells delicious
09-12-2020T23:10:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"it’s got Zinfandel, ripe raspberry, honey, and cinnamon bark"
09-12-2020T23:11:03,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t know what zinfandel is but I smell sweet raspberries
09-12-2020T23:11:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera Could Not Wait for me to empty that first box
09-12-2020T23:11:59,SpazztasticKiwi,🐈 ➡️ 📦
09-12-2020T23:32:42,CrRAR,Zinfandels I think are pretty mellow wines for being reds so makes sense.
09-12-2020T23:33:26,CrRAR,"Though luckily they stuck crafting the scent profile off the description, not the TASTE of actual wine."
09-12-2020T23:33:55,CrRAR,"if a candle smelled like any wine tastes, that's be weiiird"
09-12-2020T23:36:38,CrRAR,"box'sploraton time, best time"
09-12-2020T23:37:17,CrRAR,Does the box have any gaps for him to grab at things from?
09-12-2020T23:47:40,SpazztasticKiwi,the bottom flaps have a crack
09-12-2020T23:48:05,SpazztasticKiwi,he was immediately obsessed as soon as he saw it
09-12-2020T23:49:03,SpazztasticKiwi,"I opened it and it’s cat head in the way, cat head in the way, cat head in the way"
09-12-2020T23:49:50,SpazztasticKiwi,couldn’t get all the goodies and bubblewrap our fast enough

09-12-2020T23:56:34,CrRAR,"or like those ""fidget-cubes"" with multiple sides like with clickies, snappies, buttons etc,"
09-12-2020T23:57:11,CrRAR,"Though a cat, esp Bagheera, sounds like would destroy it fairly quicklyyy."
