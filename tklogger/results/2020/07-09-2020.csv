07-09-2020T18:25:12,AspiringNoodle,Was reading the latest page of A&H Club by Rick Griffin
07-09-2020T18:25:20,CrRAR,"wait 10, not 12"
07-09-2020T18:25:26,AspiringNoodle,The page really hits home about how being poor in a first world country is so expensive...
07-09-2020T18:25:39,CrRAR,oh yeah I saw an example about that
07-09-2020T18:25:54,CrRAR,Like that cheap goods are basically an endless subscription service XD
07-09-2020T18:26:22,BADBackgroundProductions,"I have an idea of how to make them, I just don‚Äôt know how to put them on Picarto"
07-09-2020T18:26:24,AspiringNoodle,It's kinda like how I went used car shopping 2 years ago
07-09-2020T18:27:11,AspiringNoodle,"Budget was ~$7500.  Very few cars actually near that cost,  Usually was under $6,000 or over $9,000"
07-09-2020T18:27:29,Ordithus,heh
07-09-2020T18:27:40,AspiringNoodle,And the cars that came in under budget were either 15+ years old and / or 200k+ miles
07-09-2020T18:27:46,BADBackgroundProductions,Wow...
07-09-2020T18:28:03,AspiringNoodle,I went a little over budget at $8200 with dealers fees and such
07-09-2020T18:28:04,RimaDraws,i am my bfs girl
07-09-2020T18:28:12,CrRAR,I like how they're like 'it doesn't even have keyless entry'
07-09-2020T18:28:12,AspiringNoodle,But snagged a 2014 ford focus with 93k miles
07-09-2020T18:28:23,CrRAR,It's tought to avoid push-button to start nowadays
07-09-2020T18:28:39,Ordithus,Maaan I woulda sold you my 2011 for less haha
07-09-2020T18:28:54,Ordithus,... which would make sense
07-09-2020T18:29:01,Ordithus,goes home
07-09-2020T18:29:08,AspiringNoodle,I want to treat this car right
07-09-2020T18:29:18,BADBackgroundProductions,What‚Äôs so bad about Push-button?
07-09-2020T18:29:37,CrRAR,"Nothing really, I was just very avoidant at first xD"
07-09-2020T18:29:52,AspiringNoodle,"My last car lasted 18 years or so.  But between the mechanical repairs and the frame starting to rust, it was time to ditch it"
07-09-2020T18:29:55,CrRAR,"I didn't want a CVT either in my car, I'm just very traditional"
07-09-2020T18:30:07,CrRAR,They put CVTs in everything now
07-09-2020T18:30:15,AspiringNoodle,it's a mothereffing gimmick man
07-09-2020T18:30:19,Ordithus,stick shifts are my fave <3
07-09-2020T18:30:26,CrRAR,yis
07-09-2020T18:30:32,AspiringNoodle,"Unless they let them do what they were made to do, there's no point in having a CVT over a traditional gear setup"
07-09-2020T18:30:43,CrRAR,"please keep cars mechanical, at least a little"
07-09-2020T18:31:10,CrRAR,"If I want less explody, geary parts I'll go electric"
07-09-2020T18:31:27,AspiringNoodle,"Pro-tip.  If your car has a CVT, but the RPMs change as you speed up and you aren't moving the gas pedal, you got jipped"
07-09-2020T18:31:44,BADBackgroundProductions,Can you believe that people are trying to invent self driving cars now?
07-09-2020T18:31:54,CrRAR,Yeah CVTs are better I guess from a simplicity standpoint
07-09-2020T18:31:56,Ordithus,manufacturers did that because folks thought it was really weird
07-09-2020T18:32:05,AspiringNoodle,But it defeats the purpose of a CVT
07-09-2020T18:32:12,Ordithus,also true
07-09-2020T18:32:14,CrRAR,yeah
07-09-2020T18:32:24,AspiringNoodle,"If it isn't allowed to maintain the ideal gear ratio, you've got a more expensive, more likely to break transmission"
07-09-2020T18:32:48,AspiringNoodle,"So if they have the ""fake rev"" bs going on, you just paid for the privilege of owning a gimmick"
07-09-2020T18:32:49,SpazztasticKiwi,still don‚Äôt know what car I want
07-09-2020T18:32:58,CrRAR,It's like two cones that constantly ove in relation to each other to keep a 'smooth' experience
07-09-2020T18:33:26,CrRAR,so jeah making it emulate a standard trans is a step backward haha
07-09-2020T18:33:28,AspiringNoodle,...I still need to give my car its first detailing :(
07-09-2020T18:33:41,CrRAR,"wax on, wax off"

07-09-2020T18:34:35,CrRAR,I would just take a vacuum to the inside

07-09-2020T18:36:17,AspiringNoodle,Cars can be expensive.  They can also be cheap
07-09-2020T18:36:22,CrRAR,haha
07-09-2020T18:36:30,AspiringNoodle,"But if you go the cheap route, they're likely to die sooner and run you more money"
07-09-2020T18:36:53,CrRAR,"My maintenance costs have been pretty low, I don't drive tons of miles esp now"
07-09-2020T18:36:56,AspiringNoodle,"0 washing / wax?  clear coat / paint will wear away, then the body can start to rust.  Also the frame."
07-09-2020T18:37:06,CrRAR,I mostly do oil and coolant myself
07-09-2020T18:37:09,BADBackgroundProductions,...Is getting your own car even worth the cost?
07-09-2020T18:37:23,CrRAR,"transmission fluid too, I used to"
07-09-2020T18:37:28,AspiringNoodle,"Oil changes should be done at least 2x a year, or every X-thousand miles, (whichever comes first)"
07-09-2020T18:37:31,CrRAR,my new cars procedure is a pain tho
07-09-2020T18:37:32,Ordithus,"depends.  for me, yeah.  I live alone and need it to do pretty much anything"
07-09-2020T18:37:43,AspiringNoodle,"If you don't, the oil can gunk up the engine, reducing fuel efficiency, increasing wear, etc."
07-09-2020T18:37:55,AspiringNoodle,"If the engine dies, you're better off buying a newer car"
07-09-2020T18:37:56,CrRAR,Leasing if you don't need to travel far is very afforable nowadays

07-09-2020T18:50:03,CrRAR,:cw0lfmare-BerninAngry::grapes:
07-09-2020T18:50:07,BADBackgroundProductions,We‚Äôre just discussing the unoriginalty of most car commercials
07-09-2020T18:50:24,Ordithus,"not expecting a stream tonight, we're just odd"
07-09-2020T18:52:14,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,Oh. My favorite ones (literally) are Lincoln commercials. I love the way they do them
07-09-2020T18:53:08,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,"I do not like that new one that said ‚Äúout with the old, in with the new‚Äù. The old cars are better Dang It!!"
07-09-2020T18:53:15,CrRAR,"Mcconaueagh: ""I'm not in a car. I'm in an EXPERIENCE."""
07-09-2020T18:53:27,CrRAR,:ptv-ohmy: omg
07-09-2020T18:53:29,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,"Not sure who it was by, maybe Toyota?"
07-09-2020T18:54:00,CrRAR,yeah new car grills are pissing me off
07-09-2020T18:54:14,CrRAR,Everything is a DAMN RECTANGLE now
07-09-2020T18:54:19,CrRAR,:ptv-angry:
07-09-2020T18:54:30,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,Oof mussel cars are the best üòù
07-09-2020T18:54:34,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,Old*
07-09-2020T18:54:51,CrRAR,The challenger is pretty neat
07-09-2020T18:55:01,CrRAR,and the pre-new design mustang
07-09-2020T18:55:12,CrRAR,the new one is meh for me
07-09-2020T18:55:14,AspiringNoodle,I actually like the new grill design on Fords
07-09-2020T18:55:18,AspiringNoodle,Just think they look awkward on mustangs
07-09-2020T18:55:28,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,"Oof, you would not like the 80s everything was square from what I‚Äôve heard"
07-09-2020T18:55:44,AspiringNoodle,"It's not the shape, it's the low efford"
07-09-2020T18:55:48,CrRAR,"yeah it pissed me off when the new mustang looked more like an elongated, sportier fusion"
07-09-2020T18:56:05,CrRAR,"then they killed the fusion, I think"
07-09-2020T18:56:20,CrRAR,"""Can't have ppl realize THAT simularity"""
07-09-2020T18:56:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I forgot to add mac sauce on my order so I went inside with my wallet cause it‚Äôs 20c
07-09-2020T18:56:58,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,Curves are the best in several different topics including cars
07-09-2020T18:57:10,AspiringNoodle,"Honestly, I want to ask the car industry"
07-09-2020T18:57:13,CrRAR,nvm fusion I guess still exists
07-09-2020T18:57:17,SpazztasticKiwi,"dude called out for it & when I asked isn‚Äôt it 20c, he said don‚Äôt worry about it"
07-09-2020T18:57:23,SpazztasticKiwi,so I didn‚Äôt argue
07-09-2020T18:57:23,AspiringNoodle,What the FUCK was wrong with them from the 80's - early 2000's?
07-09-2020T18:57:35,CrRAR,exxxcelllent spazzz :ok_hand:
07-09-2020T18:57:48,AspiringNoodle,How the HELL do you go from this: https://www.hotrod.com/uploads/sites/21/2019/05/001-werneke-1970-ford-mustang-boss-302-front-three-quarter.jpg
07-09-2020T18:58:03,AspiringNoodle,To this: https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/9Jqrb/s1/1980-ford-mustang.jpg
07-09-2020T18:58:38,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,Like I said. Curves are the best in several different topics. Now aren‚Äôt they?
07-09-2020T18:59:04,AspiringNoodle,"Indeed.  So my question is, who do I punch in the nuts for the obvious downgrade in car design starting in the 80's that lasted almost 3 decades"
07-09-2020T18:59:37,AspiringNoodle,I wouldn't even spit on most cars from those decades.  That would be too good for them
07-09-2020T18:59:57,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,It‚Äôs not the company. It‚Äôs what people would buy at the time. That‚Äôs what would sell at that time
07-09-2020T19:00:09,CrRAR,I know everything became rectangles at one point
07-09-2020T19:00:14,AspiringNoodle,"Welp, good to know people in the 80's and 90's had garbage taste"
07-09-2020T19:00:15,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,People were tired of curves I guess
07-09-2020T19:00:16,CrRAR,Rectangles and Landeau rooves
07-09-2020T19:00:37,CrRAR,It was the CYBERpunk future
07-09-2020T19:00:51,CrRAR,Electrotechno robot carsss
07-09-2020T19:00:53,AspiringNoodle,"Nope, it was the dark ages"
07-09-2020T19:00:59,CrRAR,haha
07-09-2020T19:00:59,AspiringNoodle,And we're now in the rennaissance
07-09-2020T19:01:11,AspiringNoodle,I would buy just about any car out there today.  They all look that good
07-09-2020T19:01:36,BADBackgroundProductions,"There are still some cool looking cars today, have you ever seen the Mazda RX Vision"
07-09-2020T19:01:46,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,Seems like the future is going more box-y again. But this time with rectangles thrown in the mix. Like for say: the Cyber Truck
07-09-2020T19:02:01,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,Triangles*
07-09-2020T19:02:07,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,Stupid iPad
07-09-2020T19:02:57,Ordithus,"cyber truck is weird, so weird.  I thought it was a joke"
07-09-2020T19:03:01,Ordithus,Still not convinced
07-09-2020T19:03:03,CrRAR,yeah the cybertruck is really just honoring that era (and cheap design)
07-09-2020T19:03:15,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,I thought the electric hummer was a joke at first
07-09-2020T19:03:27,CrRAR,They want to undersell other trucks so they just did something extreamly basic I feel
07-09-2020T19:03:51,CrRAR,or at least compete with other truck prices on the market
07-09-2020T19:04:01,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,I was like ‚Äúelectric hummer?! Pfft...‚Äù
07-09-2020T19:04:07,CrRAR,I feel like someday they will refine it to look more traditional
07-09-2020T19:04:25,BADBackgroundProductions,CyberTruck? You mean that weird looking tank thing?
07-09-2020T19:04:48,CrRAR,Humer is a weird one I thought they sold off the brand to the Chinese after it's heyday in the mid 'naughts
07-09-2020T19:04:52,CrRAR,*Hummer
07-09-2020T19:05:24,CrRAR,That's what I had read at least forever ago
07-09-2020T19:05:26,BADBackgroundProductions,I‚Äôm still waiting for flying cars but I suspect that we‚Äôre never going to get them
07-09-2020T19:05:40,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,The hummer and a Simi by Tesla are stupid ideas to put as electric
07-09-2020T19:05:52,Ordithus,"Speaking as someone who has flown airplanes and driven cars, you don't want flying cars"
07-09-2020T19:05:54,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,There gonna go two feet and need charging
07-09-2020T19:06:00,CrRAR,lol
07-09-2020T19:06:15,CrRAR,Maybe pilotless public transport drones
07-09-2020T19:06:32,Ordithus,if you hate money
07-09-2020T19:06:51,CrRAR,no they could be like public transit
07-09-2020T19:07:06,CrRAR,Ubers of THE SKY
07-09-2020T19:07:11,CrRAR,Sk-ubers
07-09-2020T19:07:16,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,LG is working on a driverless bus. Is that cool? There will be a lot of old lady deaths though.
07-09-2020T19:08:08,CrRAR,"no old lady deaths, big claw reaches out and ensures all passengers are properly seated with arms and legs withing THE CABIN"
07-09-2020T19:08:29,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,I meant the old lady‚Äôs OUTSIDE it
07-09-2020T19:08:37,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,Aka in front of it

07-09-2020T19:09:49,CrRAR,everything will be telemetrically coordinated
07-09-2020T19:10:01,CrRAR,Like the futurama intro
07-09-2020T19:10:07,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,Actually old people don‚Äôt like new things so many probably wouldn‚Äôt take the life saving suit
07-09-2020T19:10:10,Ordithus,what a time to be a grandma
