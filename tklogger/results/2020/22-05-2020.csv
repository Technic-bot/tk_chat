22-05-2020T00:55:36,Dadrobit,The pain you feel in your shoulder after firing so many rounds is just the communism leaving the body.
22-05-2020T00:55:40,ShamusTheFox,"Oh, I get it, Nibbs is erupting out of the castle lime a kaiju."

22-05-2020T01:05:06,Ordithus,"sand castles: fun to make, fun to destroy!"
22-05-2020T01:05:07,unsteddyphoenix,WHy does that bit sound familiar...
22-05-2020T01:05:23,SageSaga,Dragon Ball Z Abridged Broly Movie\
22-05-2020T01:05:25,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,Nibboreeeno
22-05-2020T01:05:31,unsteddyphoenix,Ahhh thats it
22-05-2020T01:05:34,CrimsonHelsing,Lol!
22-05-2020T01:05:36,BluePhantom90,Nuuu Tom you should have done something like Alien with Sythe making a Sand Maren and Nibbly bursting out from the sand at her belly
22-05-2020T01:05:48,Ordithus,:ptv-shock:
22-05-2020T01:05:49,Demianartist,Who see the original Broly movie?
22-05-2020T01:05:50,NezumiYuki,Oh shiiiiii Blue!
22-05-2020T01:05:57,JojoGD,me
22-05-2020T01:06:34,Demianartist,in spanish right?
22-05-2020T01:06:41,SageSaga,y'all need to stop backseat arting
22-05-2020T01:06:47,JojoGD,nope in english
22-05-2020T01:06:56,unsteddyphoenix,Sage make her boobs bigger!
22-05-2020T01:07:05,johnnytho,what does backseat art mean
22-05-2020T01:07:18,NezumiYuki,Whoa wait guys.. Watch out... Sage got the Ban Hammer out!
22-05-2020T01:07:19,BluePhantom90,What it would have made more sense for Nibbly to destroy the sand art. Nibbly doesn't want Sythe to be taken from her
22-05-2020T01:07:25,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,darnit Blue now I am imagining that just with it being the actual Maren burried in the sand
22-05-2020T01:07:34,Demianartist,"so why in english, Jojo?"
22-05-2020T01:07:38,BluePhantom90,lol
22-05-2020T01:07:39,SageSaga,"its based on the saying ""Backseat driver"" which is a passenger telling the driver how to drive"
22-05-2020T01:07:53,JojoGD,oh
22-05-2020T01:07:59,BluePhantom90,lol
22-05-2020T01:08:01,johnnytho,oh! annoying
22-05-2020T01:08:02,ZRO4825,"Oh, I love when I get those. I usually drive MORE insane when they do that shit."
22-05-2020T01:08:05,SageSaga,thus a backseat artist is a person telling someone how to draw rather than letting them draw what they want
22-05-2020T01:08:20,Demianartist,holy drive
22-05-2020T01:08:27,ZRO4825,"Sage, I'mma need you to bump up all them cup sizes. '.'/"
22-05-2020T01:08:33,BluePhantom90,I know but it was a funny idea
22-05-2020T01:08:37,Twokinds,done

22-05-2020T01:09:39,NezumiYuki,I wanna fav that LoFi kat so hard!
22-05-2020T01:10:00,Dadrobit,LoFi Kat was pretty top tier
22-05-2020T01:10:03,Demianartist,hey what is your opinion of new desing of deviantart?
22-05-2020T01:10:06,johnnytho,"Ok, thought those were just for sunday sketches, so i asked"

22-05-2020T01:10:46,swack24,Heh Nibbly is godzilla
22-05-2020T01:10:47,unsteddyphoenix,The boobs do seem a bit too autonomous from each other
22-05-2020T01:11:04,Dadrobit,They have developed minds of their own...
22-05-2020T01:11:19,NezumiYuki,"Hey Tom, for SERIOUS ...   Maybe leave a partial list of your usual play-list in the description to LoFi Kathrin, for everyone to enjoy?  :D"
22-05-2020T01:11:24,SageSaga,the tail moves too much
22-05-2020T01:12:10,Nekonny,the tail isn't what I'm focusing on
22-05-2020T01:12:47,Demianartist,i just want to say something.
22-05-2020T01:12:49,unsteddyphoenix,lol
22-05-2020T01:12:51,BluePhantom90,"Well someone might suggest it now that I mentioned it. Sythe dose a ""Maren Sand Sculpture"

22-05-2020T01:26:52,AspiringNoodle,"The question becomes, will he be hands on?  Passive at first, observing and seeing what he can correct?"
22-05-2020T01:27:17,AspiringNoodle,Will he have me go off and do my own thing?  Or will I lock down the registers for the night and he has him do other things around the store?
22-05-2020T01:27:39,AspiringNoodle,Because register duty don't stop me from doing other stuff :D
22-05-2020T01:28:19,Demianartist,so now what?

22-05-2020T01:35:19,MatyMaty,It all comes down to figuring out the momentum
22-05-2020T01:35:31,MatyMaty,and remembering there's a small delay in the motion
22-05-2020T01:37:47,Demianartist,see you soon guys i Claudio going to eat pizza.

22-05-2020T02:18:52,Dadrobit,I ain't kicking nobody out. I'm just calling the cops and letting THEM kick em out.

22-05-2020T02:25:47,Dadrobit,Yes. That's literally the point of the badge. And the job itself.

22-05-2020T03:03:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"unless that’s a really bad translator, it’s pretty straightforward"
22-05-2020T03:06:44,SpazztasticKiwi,other than that I saw a baby squirrel awhile ago
22-05-2020T03:08:20,Demianartist,oh now i know what you mean.
22-05-2020T03:14:57,Demianartist,you stay here?
22-05-2020T03:18:53,DarthRexKing,Bye all.

22-05-2020T14:30:26,ThoseButterflys,hello
22-05-2020T14:30:39,ThoseButterflys,to everyone
22-05-2020T14:31:03,SageSaga,yo yo
22-05-2020T14:35:03,Ordithus,no music today?
22-05-2020T14:35:29,SageSaga,music is on
22-05-2020T14:35:35,Ordithus,hmm brb
22-05-2020T14:36:16,ThoseButterflys,aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah i got it covered i got spotify
22-05-2020T14:37:47,Ordithus,still got nothing
22-05-2020T14:38:33,ThoseButterflys,sage realizing its the song stuck in his his head that he thinks is playing
22-05-2020T14:38:46,SageSaga,looking into it
22-05-2020T14:38:55,SageSaga,it says its playing
22-05-2020T14:39:19,Ordithus,"OBS issue, or maybe picarto is being weird (again)"
22-05-2020T14:39:29,ThoseButterflys,your good
22-05-2020T14:39:32,Ordithus,ah there it is
22-05-2020T14:41:20,SageSaga,brb
22-05-2020T14:56:24,Ordithus,1 a week updates and watching the streams makes it feel like we've been in this scene a lot longer than we actually have :ptv-laugh:
22-05-2020T14:57:04,SageSaga,eh?
22-05-2020T14:57:12,SageSaga,the talking at the table? XD
22-05-2020T14:57:21,Ordithus,yeah!  this is only the 6th? page of it
22-05-2020T14:57:29,SageSaga,yep
22-05-2020T14:57:31,Ordithus,For some reason I feel like it's been a lot longer
22-05-2020T14:57:40,SageSaga,well thats over a month :P
22-05-2020T14:57:54,Ordithus,time has slown down~
22-05-2020T14:57:54,SageSaga,but this is the last one
22-05-2020T14:58:28,TeapotOfDoom,hey everyone
22-05-2020T14:58:32,Ordithus,hi teapot
22-05-2020T14:59:07,TeapotOfDoom,1 hour in and you're already almost through flat colors
22-05-2020T14:59:23,TeapotOfDoom,your speed is unmatched :cteapotofdoom-cat_rotate:
22-05-2020T14:59:58,TeapotOfDoom,o/ ord whaddup
22-05-2020T15:01:14,SageSaga,im well past flats at 1 hour XD
22-05-2020T15:01:54,Ordithus,think you were done with those when I joined half an hour ago
22-05-2020T15:02:03,TeapotOfDoom,i stand corrected
22-05-2020T15:05:43,SageSaga,i gotta remember to write a letter to my nephew over the weekend
22-05-2020T15:07:24,TeapotOfDoom,i maximised the window and my xserver crashed
22-05-2020T15:07:30,TeapotOfDoom,fun
22-05-2020T15:07:54,TeapotOfDoom,nvidia driver has been really buggy since a few versions

22-05-2020T15:17:20,sunblaze,:P
22-05-2020T15:32:30,SageSaga,so - random thought here- ive been trying to think about the best way to explain homosexuality to someone who doesnt get it-
22-05-2020T15:33:07,TeapotOfDoom,doesn't get it? in what regard?
22-05-2020T15:33:09,Ordithus,that is pretty random!
22-05-2020T15:33:12,SageSaga,"and i usually come down to the point where im like ""ok- you can only know your own experiences- so at what point do you remember choosing to be streaight"""
22-05-2020T15:33:16,SageSaga,straight*
22-05-2020T15:33:44,SageSaga,people who are like sex can only be between a man and woman and anything else is unnatural
22-05-2020T15:34:47,TeapotOfDoom,well it strongly depends on the world view those people have
22-05-2020T15:34:49,SageSaga,"and them im like - ""Ok- let's say magic is real- and i magically swap your mind into a females body  (assuming talking to a man) do you think you would now be attracted to men?"""
22-05-2020T15:35:00,TeapotOfDoom,"as soon as *god* is involved, it get's pretty hard"
22-05-2020T15:35:10,Ordithus,that might break their mind
22-05-2020T15:35:25,TeapotOfDoom,there is this saying in german
22-05-2020T15:35:33,TeapotOfDoom,Weil nicht sein kann was nicht sein darf
22-05-2020T15:35:45,Ordithus,translation?
22-05-2020T15:35:58,TeapotOfDoom,It basically means: It can't be because it's not allowed to be
22-05-2020T15:36:06,SageSaga,yeah but if they involve God I can just point out that these people according to them all were made by god and science so far has proven these people arent wrong about their feelings- so did God mess up?
22-05-2020T15:36:30,TeapotOfDoom,my mom told me an example
22-05-2020T15:36:42,TeapotOfDoom,there was a guy thinking he was a corpse
22-05-2020T15:36:58,TeapotOfDoom,he went to a psychatrist and stated that he was a corpse
22-05-2020T15:37:07,Ordithus,"well the more nuanced argument there would be that man lives under the curse of sin, so not the perfection of god's design"
22-05-2020T15:37:15,TeapotOfDoom,the psychatrist asked: can corpses bleed?
22-05-2020T15:37:26,TeapotOfDoom,the patient replied no.
22-05-2020T15:37:48,TeapotOfDoom,the psychatrist told him to cut his finger to see if he would bleed
22-05-2020T15:38:04,TeapotOfDoom,the guy did so and obviously shed a drop of blood
22-05-2020T15:38:21,TeapotOfDoom,He then stated: Huh. I guess corpses can bleed.
22-05-2020T15:39:17,TeapotOfDoom,People who are that deep down the rabbit hole won't be easy to convince
22-05-2020T15:40:08,TeapotOfDoom,and it takes time if it works at all
22-05-2020T15:40:25,Ordithus,"I think the best way of explaining is to just point out their innate attraction - and that there are many people who have that, but for the same sex"
22-05-2020T15:41:17,TeapotOfDoom,yep. and if that won't work and they call devils work well yeah
22-05-2020T15:41:34,SageSaga,yeah but they cant understand that because they claim to be able to choose yet would never choose
22-05-2020T15:41:44,TeapotOfDoom,i have some friends who's grandma wants them to marry right away because that's how it should be
22-05-2020T15:42:12,TeapotOfDoom,yeah because they would never make the wrong choice
22-05-2020T15:42:20,TeapotOfDoom,wrong here being the point
22-05-2020T15:42:43,SageSaga,the concept of choosing to be gay- that it's a choice even though they never made that choice
22-05-2020T15:43:28,sunblaze,I once choose cheese is fucking great.
22-05-2020T15:43:39,Ordithus,don't know why anyone would choose to be gay considering all the hate that exists
22-05-2020T15:43:46,TeapotOfDoom,i once chose i'm not allergic to pollen and nutts
22-05-2020T15:43:54,sunblaze,"but of course that was a conclusion from trying, failing and success. not a actual choice I did"
22-05-2020T15:44:06,sunblaze,sadly many do not get the same for sexuality
22-05-2020T15:44:19,TeapotOfDoom,"it's a stupid claim just like ""i am a corpse"" but try shaking peoples foundations"
22-05-2020T15:45:07,TeapotOfDoom,the only thing weird about homosexuality is being the only straight guy at a party... that was an educational experience to say the least xD
22-05-2020T15:45:27,sunblaze,I guesd :D
22-05-2020T15:45:27,SageSaga,but the thing is- a lot of people admit these days that they arent all 100% straight - like a lot of people have said they have felt attracted to other people of the same sex before
22-05-2020T15:45:34,TeapotOfDoom,i felt reaaally weird the entire time xD
22-05-2020T15:46:15,TeapotOfDoom,"people claiming ""sexuality is a choice"" had that built into their core view of the world"
22-05-2020T15:46:35,CrRAR,"True, some of that might be curiousity, which can confirm feelings one way or another."
22-05-2020T15:46:39,TeapotOfDoom,falsifying that would be like telling them gravity is a choice
22-05-2020T15:46:56,sunblaze,gravity SHOULD be a choice. sadly :(
22-05-2020T15:47:00,TeapotOfDoom,lol
22-05-2020T15:47:11,Ordithus,"with an on/off switch, of course"
22-05-2020T15:47:26,Ordithus,"if I can only have gravity or no gravity, gravity, please"
22-05-2020T15:47:26,TeapotOfDoom,for gravity or sexuality
22-05-2020T15:48:22,SageSaga,gravity is a spectrum!
22-05-2020T15:48:26,TeapotOfDoom,i mean as long as you have a way to offset conservation of momentum gimme that switch
22-05-2020T15:50:21,SageSaga,Negative Gravity! Byeeeeee! *goes hurdling away from the planet*
22-05-2020T15:50:29,Ordithus,"really fast, at that"
22-05-2020T15:51:27,SageSaga,i played this game- space engineers i think? And they had a limit on the speed engines could move you
22-05-2020T15:51:38,SageSaga,but that limit didnt work for Gravity generators-
22-05-2020T15:51:38,TeapotOfDoom,had a lecture with a guy leading a team similar to nasa eagle labs. he talked about break through propulsion
22-05-2020T15:52:04,TeapotOfDoom,"he basically told us ""Yeah we're pretty sure warp drive exists"""
22-05-2020T15:52:33,SageSaga,you basically built a railgun with max gravity and mass to go super fast XD
22-05-2020T15:52:34,TeapotOfDoom,"""Also we've built an experimental one using singular particles and it turns out that it works"""
22-05-2020T15:52:56,TeapotOfDoom,and showed us measurements with self acellerating photons
22-05-2020T15:54:51,TeapotOfDoom,i went on to ask how that would effect time dialation and other relativity theory effects. his anser: we dunno. we've never seen something like this before so we don't know what would happen if that thing approaches the speed of light
22-05-2020T15:55:27,TeapotOfDoom,he said that it does not exchange momentum so it should in fact not be limited by the speed of light
22-05-2020T15:56:02,TeapotOfDoom,if it actually isn't we don't know yet
22-05-2020T15:58:02,TeapotOfDoom,./rant
22-05-2020T15:58:43,SageSaga,im curious what your talking about-
22-05-2020T15:59:05,SageSaga,singular particles?
22-05-2020T15:59:11,TeapotOfDoom,yep
22-05-2020T15:59:14,Ordithus,warp drive?!
22-05-2020T15:59:17,TeapotOfDoom,yup
22-05-2020T15:59:20,TeapotOfDoom,well sorta
22-05-2020T15:59:30,SageSaga,warp drive is about changing the distance of space and riding it
22-05-2020T15:59:31,TeapotOfDoom,they don't know if it is. they suspect it to be
22-05-2020T16:00:11,SageSaga,if you can warp space you can make 2 points closer and if expanding space behind it you create a wave in space that pushes you
22-05-2020T16:00:22,TeapotOfDoom,basically you can generate particles with negative inertia
22-05-2020T16:00:34,SageSaga,which would allow you to go faster than light yet not because the distance is shorter now
22-05-2020T16:00:46,TeapotOfDoom,which is the most funky thing ever but it exists
22-05-2020T16:00:55,TeapotOfDoom,we have seen those particles in experiments
22-05-2020T16:01:26,TeapotOfDoom,it basically means that if you push the particle it will not fling in the direction you pushed it
22-05-2020T16:01:28,Ordithus,"that's not warp, then - that's breaking the acceleration to light speed"
22-05-2020T16:01:32,TeapotOfDoom,but towards you instead
22-05-2020T16:01:41,TeapotOfDoom,yep that's the idea
22-05-2020T16:01:53,SageSaga,yeah thats what im saying
22-05-2020T16:01:57,TeapotOfDoom,being close to the speed of light is nasty because time get's really wonky
22-05-2020T16:02:09,SageSaga,not really wonky-
22-05-2020T16:02:25,TeapotOfDoom,and i wanna travel to a specific place that isn't the future
22-05-2020T16:02:36,TeapotOfDoom,*far future
22-05-2020T16:02:53,TeapotOfDoom,(I'm too lazy to explain time dialation)
22-05-2020T16:03:07,Ordithus,"fast things slow time, pretty much"
22-05-2020T16:03:22,SageSaga,we know what time dilation is
22-05-2020T16:03:41,TeapotOfDoom,ok well you take two particles
22-05-2020T16:03:54,Ordithus,and they fall very much in love~
22-05-2020T16:03:56,TeapotOfDoom,one has normal inertia and one has negative inertia
22-05-2020T16:04:02,TeapotOfDoom,basically
22-05-2020T16:04:14,TeapotOfDoom,both are charged. one is + one is -
22-05-2020T16:04:15,SageSaga,im saying time doesnt become wonky because wonky would be unnatural- but theres nothing unnatural about the physics XD
22-05-2020T16:04:40,TeapotOfDoom,in reference to our normal perception of time i think wonky fits pretty well
22-05-2020T16:05:20,SageSaga,we  arent normal
22-05-2020T16:05:22,TeapotOfDoom,anyway. the particles would attract each other now. but because one of them has negative inertia it get's flung away instead
22-05-2020T16:05:32,TeapotOfDoom,and the other one follows
22-05-2020T16:05:52,TeapotOfDoom,this makes a self accelerating system
22-05-2020T16:06:04,TeapotOfDoom,"and as stupid as this sounds, it works"
22-05-2020T16:06:19,SageSaga,yeah but i dont see how it stops time dilation
22-05-2020T16:06:38,TeapotOfDoom,we don't know if it does yet
22-05-2020T16:06:55,TeapotOfDoom,but there is no momentum exchanged
22-05-2020T16:06:59,SageSaga,im gonna go with the theory that it doesnt
22-05-2020T16:07:14,TeapotOfDoom,which means the light speed barrier should theoretically be null and void
22-05-2020T16:07:49,SageSaga,im not sure thats how that works but it is a bit beyond my knowledge
22-05-2020T16:07:52,TeapotOfDoom,well the thing that would make warp 100% possible would be negative mass
22-05-2020T16:08:23,TeapotOfDoom,and there's something in our universe which seems to have this property called dark energy for a lack of a better name
22-05-2020T16:08:57,SageSaga,like- if i remember correctly its anything with mass moving at near or at light speed is where time dilation happens
22-05-2020T16:09:14,Ordithus,where it becomes significant~
22-05-2020T16:09:15,SageSaga,just because it can technically go faster doesnt mean time wont be affected
22-05-2020T16:09:38,SageSaga,movement through space is the issue right?
22-05-2020T16:09:45,TeapotOfDoom,but to the particles it looks like they are not picking up speed
22-05-2020T16:09:55,TeapotOfDoom,it's the base state of the system
22-05-2020T16:10:04,TeapotOfDoom,yes
22-05-2020T16:10:06,Ordithus,until the cat opens the box and observes them going really fast
22-05-2020T16:10:11,Ordithus,wait
22-05-2020T16:10:18,TeapotOfDoom,the question is WHAT THE HELL EVEN IS THAT
22-05-2020T16:10:37,TeapotOfDoom,we don't know and that's the point
22-05-2020T16:10:50,TeapotOfDoom,we have something picking up speed without taking in energy
22-05-2020T16:11:30,TeapotOfDoom,the theory of relativity sees that as staying still. we don't know if that's really the case
22-05-2020T16:11:35,SageSaga,yeah- that sounds impossible
22-05-2020T16:11:42,SageSaga,where is this from again?
22-05-2020T16:11:50,TeapotOfDoom,i've seen the calculations it is really not
22-05-2020T16:12:12,TeapotOfDoom,the particles are at their base state. acceleration is their lowest point of energy
22-05-2020T16:12:25,SageSaga,it literally goes against one of the most fundamental processes in our world
22-05-2020T16:12:34,TeapotOfDoom,the guy who held the lecture works at the university dresden iirx
22-05-2020T16:12:37,TeapotOfDoom,iirc
22-05-2020T16:12:37,SageSaga,you cant get something from nothing
22-05-2020T16:12:50,Ordithus,"I think when we're talking about this pair of particles, there is nothing that could be extracted from them"
22-05-2020T16:12:56,TeapotOfDoom,no because there is no impulse exchanged
22-05-2020T16:13:04,TeapotOfDoom,it does not break conservation of momentum
22-05-2020T16:13:12,TeapotOfDoom,that's the weirdest thing about it
22-05-2020T16:13:26,SageSaga,probably missing something
22-05-2020T16:13:57,TeapotOfDoom,it's like dropping two magnets together
22-05-2020T16:14:05,TeapotOfDoom,but one of them is a teenager
22-05-2020T16:14:08,Ordithus,haha
22-05-2020T16:14:35,TeapotOfDoom,we're reaching hitchhikers guide to the galaxy level of explaination
22-05-2020T16:14:55,SageSaga,if this were a thing shown to have been done in a lab it should be easy to find online
22-05-2020T16:15:08,TeapotOfDoom,ima call up the slides one sek
22-05-2020T16:15:22,TeapotOfDoom,it requires to be in a special kind of crystal atm tho
22-05-2020T16:15:34,TeapotOfDoom,and only works with singular particles
22-05-2020T16:16:04,SageSaga,what kind of particle?
22-05-2020T16:16:13,Ordithus,"A quick google search turned this up, nasa and negative mass https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20200000366.pdf"
22-05-2020T16:16:51,TeapotOfDoom,some flavour of photon iirx
22-05-2020T16:16:54,TeapotOfDoom,iirc
22-05-2020T16:18:40,TeapotOfDoom,damnit where did i put those slides
22-05-2020T16:20:04,Werewing,Maybe they are in a Teapot hurtling through space?
22-05-2020T16:21:06,TeapotOfDoom,found them
22-05-2020T16:21:12,SageSaga,"Ord- cool link- concept of Negative mass is cool but its basically saying ""if negative mass was real it would act like this probably"""
22-05-2020T16:21:32,SageSaga,so now im more on- is Negative Mass real?
22-05-2020T16:21:39,TeapotOfDoom,i hope that stuff is in the slides we got
22-05-2020T16:21:50,TeapotOfDoom,he had his own for this chapter
22-05-2020T16:22:11,TeapotOfDoom,because he gave out stuff directly from his lab and competing teams
22-05-2020T16:23:07,TeapotOfDoom,there it is
22-05-2020T16:23:30,TeapotOfDoom,it was an experiment done by A. Zeilinger in the 1990s
22-05-2020T16:23:53,TeapotOfDoom,he proved the existance of negaitve inertia neutrons
22-05-2020T16:24:34,TeapotOfDoom,but all the further stuff is only in his slides sadly
22-05-2020T16:27:23,TeapotOfDoom,dang... i wanted to look that up again myself
22-05-2020T16:28:02,TeapotOfDoom,"the baseline is the effect seems to exist, we don't know if it has the desired consequenses at all or how to take it out of the lab"
22-05-2020T16:28:17,TeapotOfDoom,i sure hope it's not another dud like quantum teleportation
22-05-2020T16:28:34,SageSaga,it will probably stop function as soon as ya add any kinda mass
22-05-2020T16:29:03,TeapotOfDoom,maybe
22-05-2020T16:29:31,TeapotOfDoom,we dunno
22-05-2020T16:29:44,SageSaga,otherwise we could produce perpetual motion machines for infinite energy
22-05-2020T16:29:58,TeapotOfDoom,kind of yeah
22-05-2020T16:30:08,SageSaga,and if that seemed like a viable thing- we would be throwing so much money at that right now
22-05-2020T16:30:22,SageSaga,the fact that we arent- means its not likely
22-05-2020T16:30:27,TeapotOfDoom,i sure hope we find negative mass
22-05-2020T16:30:43,TeapotOfDoom,that would make warp possible and solve the ftl question
22-05-2020T16:31:28,TeapotOfDoom,i mean antibiotics are becoming less useful and yet there is little research because it's too expensive
22-05-2020T16:31:35,SageSaga,we just need a way to manipulate space- i think we can do that already?
22-05-2020T16:31:49,TeapotOfDoom,yeah in one direction
22-05-2020T16:31:53,TeapotOfDoom,now we need the other
22-05-2020T16:32:04,TeapotOfDoom,also that would require a black hole atm
22-05-2020T16:32:27,Werewing,I would argue are medicine could still benefit from improvements.
22-05-2020T16:32:34,Ordithus,"well, fusion has incredible potential but we aren't really throwing all that much money at it, either"
22-05-2020T16:32:45,SageSaga,you dont need a black hole to bend space
22-05-2020T16:32:54,SageSaga,anything with enough gravity bends space
22-05-2020T16:33:15,SageSaga,Fusion doesnt seem viable atm
22-05-2020T16:33:34,TeapotOfDoom,i object to that claim
22-05-2020T16:33:35,Ordithus,there's a big fusion reaction a few miles away right now~
22-05-2020T16:33:49,SageSaga,you sure?
22-05-2020T16:33:50,TeapotOfDoom,private companies have started hopping on the fusion train
22-05-2020T16:33:54,Ordithus,the sun!
22-05-2020T16:34:08,Werewing,"""a few miles""?"
22-05-2020T16:34:09,SageSaga,thats more than a few miles away
22-05-2020T16:34:11,TeapotOfDoom,so i think it's not that far into the future
22-05-2020T16:34:12,Ordithus,haha
22-05-2020T16:34:27,Werewing,"Are you a flat-Earther, Ord?"
22-05-2020T16:34:31,TeapotOfDoom,i mean in intersellar terms it's surprising we're not roasted already
22-05-2020T16:34:39,Ordithus,"we were just talking about negative inertia, space travel, yada yada and now you want to point out something about scale"
22-05-2020T16:34:51,SageSaga,yes
22-05-2020T16:34:59,Ordithus,:P
22-05-2020T16:35:04,Werewing,Scale is pretty important in terms of fusion.
22-05-2020T16:35:42,SageSaga,"a local store is a ""few miles"""
22-05-2020T16:36:09,Ordithus,"moreso I can't recall if the sun is millions of miles away or less, so I didn't want to be very precise"
22-05-2020T16:36:31,Ordithus,"so, more than one and less than infinite - few"
22-05-2020T16:36:32,SageSaga,"if you start counting 90+ million miles as a ""few"" well we should all meet up every week because a ""few miles"" is no big deal!"
22-05-2020T16:36:48,Werewing,"Honestly, I wouldn't want to be within a few miles of any nuclear reaction without shielding."
22-05-2020T16:37:36,sunblaze,ok off now. take care
22-05-2020T16:37:41,Ordithus,bye sun!
22-05-2020T16:37:44,TeapotOfDoom,i mean if you were close to a fusion reaction without shielding you would not be close for long
22-05-2020T16:37:48,TeapotOfDoom,bye sun
22-05-2020T16:38:03,SageSaga,take care Sunblaze!
22-05-2020T16:38:53,Werewing,"First you say the sun is a few miles away, and now you guys start telling it goodbye."
22-05-2020T16:38:55,TeapotOfDoom,i wanna build a fusion reactor one day
22-05-2020T16:39:28,TeapotOfDoom,it's not that hard. the only thing we don't have at home is a hf and hv generator
22-05-2020T16:39:54,TeapotOfDoom,and no i'm not building a private tokamak
22-05-2020T16:40:25,SageSaga,isnt the issue with fusion that so far we can start a reaction but it cost more power than you get out of it? (with our current methods)
22-05-2020T16:40:31,Ordithus,yes
22-05-2020T16:40:35,TeapotOfDoom,yesn't
22-05-2020T16:40:56,Ordithus,I think one of the major issues is how to keep it fuelled
22-05-2020T16:40:58,TeapotOfDoom,i think there have been attempts. still not viable tho
22-05-2020T16:41:08,TeapotOfDoom,also cooling the chamber
22-05-2020T16:41:47,SageSaga,like- a star keeps it going because its a ton of fuel and gravity-
22-05-2020T16:41:59,SageSaga,so how do we keep something going on earth?
22-05-2020T16:42:15,Werewing,"By blowing up the planet, duh!"
22-05-2020T16:42:17,SageSaga,we cant supply enough hydrogen for it to be self sustaining
22-05-2020T16:42:34,SageSaga,so do we use some other kinda fuel?
22-05-2020T16:42:56,TeapotOfDoom,i think the bigger problem was removing spent fuel
22-05-2020T16:42:57,SageSaga,but then- dont other fuels need even more energy?
22-05-2020T16:43:02,Ordithus,"the reactors we do have are also purely designed to run experiments - they aren't designed to run continuously, either"
22-05-2020T16:43:03,TeapotOfDoom,it cools down the plasma
22-05-2020T16:44:08,TeapotOfDoom,there are projects in the works for better reactors. biggest factor beeing reducing the size because of cost and practicability
22-05-2020T16:44:09,SageSaga,well yeah as you fuse atoms together they make new particles and are harder and harder to fuse so the reaction goes down right?
22-05-2020T16:44:16,TeapotOfDoom,yep
22-05-2020T16:44:28,TeapotOfDoom,and the stuff is so hot you have a hard time taking something away
22-05-2020T16:44:50,SageSaga,so you need a way to pull out those new particles without interfering with the reaction as you add more fuel
22-05-2020T16:45:17,TeapotOfDoom,also without sticking anything in there. because it will melt
22-05-2020T16:45:41,SageSaga,well yeah- i guess you need something to attract out the heavier elements
22-05-2020T16:45:51,Ordithus,lasers and shit
22-05-2020T16:46:11,TeapotOfDoom,physics get funky
22-05-2020T16:46:37,TeapotOfDoom,i read about some research on the formation of magnetic bubbles in the plasma and how to prevent them from forming
22-05-2020T16:49:57,SageSaga,all done!
22-05-2020T16:50:12,TeapotOfDoom,despite our best efforts
22-05-2020T16:50:15,TeapotOfDoom,well done sage
22-05-2020T16:50:28,Ordithus,nice~
22-05-2020T16:50:37,SageSaga,thanks for joining folks! have a great night!
22-05-2020T16:50:41,TeapotOfDoom,you too
22-05-2020T16:50:45,TeapotOfDoom,time for dnd?
22-05-2020T16:50:45,Ordithus,thanks for the stream and chat
22-05-2020T16:50:52,TeapotOfDoom,^
22-05-2020T16:51:06,Werewing,It won't be as good without a Sage.

22-05-2020T22:33:57,AspiringNoodle,Was thinking about handing in my notice in a few weeks so I could soak up more hazard pay goodness
22-05-2020T22:45:00,JojoGD,I’m going to give myself 2 hours to beat Pokémon yellow
22-05-2020T22:48:22,JojoGD,I’ll make that 3 hours
22-05-2020T22:50:10,JojoGD,I’ll probably cheat tho
22-05-2020T22:51:10,AspiringNoodle,"lol, gl with that"
22-05-2020T23:00:28,JojoGD,Dam gameboy reseted and now I have to start all over again
