27-11-2020T15:01:50,CrRAR,ok
27-11-2020T15:02:06,Ordithus,haha
27-11-2020T15:02:11,Ordithus,user your eyes crrar :eyes:
27-11-2020T15:07:35,Ordithus,How expensive is the wind walk spell? Would it be reasonable for an adventurer to take up wind surfing?
27-11-2020T15:10:02,SageSaga,easy for caster adventurers to get- dont even need to be max level
27-11-2020T15:10:41,SageSaga,it's a mid tier spell though so you dont get it by dabbling in magic a little bit
27-11-2020T15:18:43,Ordithus,I could see some players choosing wizard just for that mid/end game surfing life :ptv-dealwithit:
27-11-2020T15:20:29,SageSaga,the flying spell is available a little bit earlier but it's duration is not suited for long distance travel
27-11-2020T15:24:18,Ordithus,but which is more fun!
27-11-2020T15:26:31,SageSaga,wind walk - it's designed to be like a mini-game because people were expected to use it for longer adventures
27-11-2020T15:27:32,SageSaga,granted it mostly was used to further advance teleportation networks as wizards could also sell runes for people to use to teleport
27-11-2020T15:28:52,SageSaga,a rune was just a piece of stone or metal with what was basically GPS coordinates on it that teleport spells would use to determine where to send you
27-11-2020T15:29:44,SageSaga,so while wind walking Wizards would use eagle eye to spot interesting locations and mark them with runes as they travelled
27-11-2020T15:29:50,SageSaga,traveled*
27-11-2020T15:34:50,Hogan,Eveninges!
27-11-2020T15:34:59,Ordithus,hi hogan
27-11-2020T15:35:17,Hogan,Hey Ordithus :-)
27-11-2020T15:36:18,FoxxTrotter,"Hi, Hogan."
27-11-2020T15:36:53,Ordithus,"hmm where on earth to set up this printer. I want it on a surge protector, but there is no room on my desk"
27-11-2020T15:37:07,Ordithus,and only one outlet in this room is grounded
27-11-2020T15:37:52,Hogan,Hiya Foxx :-)
27-11-2020T15:43:17,Hogan,"Heh, the uncoloured dress on Nyna makes it look like a wedding gown XD"
27-11-2020T16:03:14,Hogan,"Okay, that moment went :p"
27-11-2020T16:03:38,Ordithus,as it does
27-11-2020T16:05:24,Hogan,Time is fleeting
27-11-2020T16:21:01,SageSaga,and that is why i reuse backgrounds sometimes
27-11-2020T16:24:17,Ordithus,zoom
27-11-2020T16:27:11,SageSaga,brb
27-11-2020T16:31:27,SageSaga,back btw
27-11-2020T16:31:30,Ordithus,wb
27-11-2020T16:34:54,Hogan,vwb
27-11-2020T16:42:26,Ordithus,"y'know, nyna would look good if that were her hair color"
27-11-2020T16:42:42,SageSaga,she looks good regardless...
27-11-2020T16:42:50,Ordithus,fact
27-11-2020T16:45:33,SageSaga,if i had unlimited funds for making the perfect home office- i think i would have an all interior office- with fake windows with 8k displays to create a virtual environment of my choosing - along with dedicated room climate controls-
27-11-2020T16:47:47,SageSaga,"better than my current ""office"" that relies on ""Black out curtains to keep out all that nasty sunlight so it doesnt mess with my displays color appearance"
27-11-2020T16:49:07,Ordithus,:cw0lfmare-Emberflail: printer printing
27-11-2020T16:49:34,Ordithus,I need to get some photo paper. And then print ALL the photos
27-11-2020T16:50:08,SageSaga,semi gloss or full glossy?
27-11-2020T16:50:39,CrRAR,successful printing
27-11-2020T16:50:42,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-maddiessparkles: a holiday miracle
27-11-2020T16:50:55,CrRAR,:poultry_leg:
27-11-2020T16:51:24,CrRAR,"semi-gloss, classy"
27-11-2020T16:51:31,CrRAR,"glossy, flashy"
27-11-2020T16:52:06,Ordithus,I'll have to try both and see which I prefer
27-11-2020T16:52:40,CrRAR,"I feel like for framing, semi is preferable"
27-11-2020T16:53:14,SageSaga,i prefer semi
27-11-2020T16:53:29,CrRAR,Does glossy assist in preventing color-fade I wonder?
27-11-2020T16:53:35,CrRAR,:thinking:
27-11-2020T16:53:51,CrRAR,Yeah matte finish is nice
27-11-2020T16:54:52,SageSaga,gloss helps vibrant colors pop more
27-11-2020T16:54:58,CrRAR,yeah
27-11-2020T16:54:59,Ordithus,it also depends on what I'm printing
27-11-2020T16:55:07,CrRAR,like LCD finishes
27-11-2020T16:55:32,CrRAR,glossy always heralded as more vibrant
27-11-2020T16:56:18,CrRAR,"It is interesting to think that the ""finish"" is actually printed over."
27-11-2020T16:56:38,CrRAR,You'd think it would get ruined or something.
27-11-2020T16:58:25,Ordithus,plain printer paper is definitely not ideal :ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
27-11-2020T16:59:03,CrRAR,nahp
27-11-2020T16:59:24,CrRAR,even gets floopy
27-11-2020T16:59:54,CrRAR,Darks esp all sort of blend cuz of the absorption I think
27-11-2020T17:00:33,Ordithus,very low contrast
27-11-2020T17:00:45,CrRAR,yep
27-11-2020T17:01:09,CrRAR,:frame_photo::mag::chipmunk:
27-11-2020T17:01:17,CrRAR,"tbh, those store printing services aren't bad for the resupplying you have to do at home."
27-11-2020T17:01:29,CrRAR,like the machine things
27-11-2020T17:01:53,CrRAR,but you have more control of a home setup once ya have it finely tuned.
27-11-2020T17:01:54,Ordithus,"Yeah. I'm sure if I want a really high quality print, like to gift, that would still be the way to go"
27-11-2020T17:02:04,CrRAR,yup
27-11-2020T17:49:12,SpazztasticKiwi,🥘
27-11-2020T17:50:51,Ordithus,what's for lunch?

27-11-2020T18:14:32,SpazztasticKiwi,chicken & rice & dumplings
27-11-2020T18:14:57,SpazztasticKiwi,I also came up with a burning question
27-11-2020T18:15:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Mark likes cracker barrel chicken n dumplings with a crack addicted unhealthy passion
27-11-2020T18:16:11,SpazztasticKiwi,"& he also likes these compliments microwave tv dinners, which has a chicken n dumplings"
27-11-2020T18:16:23,SpazztasticKiwi,so I wonder if he shuns them or thinks they’re ok
27-11-2020T18:30:17,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-keithdotdotdot:
27-11-2020T18:39:42,CrRAR,Cracker Barrel food is quite iconic

27-11-2020T18:41:25,CrRAR,"yeah, it's like America's universal 2nd choice"
27-11-2020T18:41:37,CrRAR,Nice steakhouse always #1
27-11-2020T18:51:23,CrRAR,a ribeye steak would be sumthin right now

27-11-2020T18:51:53,CrRAR,*dang
27-11-2020T18:52:23,Roughlandin,I think we have a Cracker Barrel at like every highway exit within 100 square miles of my house. It's good if you're in the mood for breakfast food and the nearest Waffle House is too shady looking to risk
27-11-2020T18:56:59,Ordithus,none of either within 150 miles of me
27-11-2020T18:58:39,Sesarag,Hewo o/
27-11-2020T19:05:21,Ordithus,o/
27-11-2020T19:42:40,SpazztasticKiwi,cracker barrel is honestly shite
27-11-2020T19:42:48,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve been to one twice
27-11-2020T19:43:22,SpazztasticKiwi,the second was passable but it’s not worth what I’ve had elsewhere
27-11-2020T19:44:42,SpazztasticKiwi,"unless someone else is paying or I’m checking out the one in Cinicnnati Mark worships, I ain’t goin"
27-11-2020T19:48:33,Ordithus,hmm I remember the pot roast being pretty good
27-11-2020T19:50:33,CrRAR,Probably hit and miss like a lot of places
27-11-2020T19:51:02,CrRAR,They do seem to be national enough to suffer lack of good coordination
27-11-2020T19:51:27,Ordithus,like any chain
27-11-2020T19:51:39,CrRAR,yeah
27-11-2020T19:56:04,CrRAR,"Plus it’s almost like their business model is to be like the most popular sleeper restaurant chain, low times at restaurants are weird. Best quality is usually when a place is bealting out the food, not the off times."
