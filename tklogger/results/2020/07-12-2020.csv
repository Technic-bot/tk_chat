07-12-2020T01:07:12,Roughlandin,Spoiler free
07-12-2020T01:07:29,Roughlandin,It's what happens after a group of plucky child superheroes grow up
07-12-2020T01:07:38,Roughlandin,And all the trauma they have to deal with
07-12-2020T01:07:49,Roughlandin,Also they have to save the world again

07-12-2020T02:31:15,w0lfmare,Yeah I'm pretty sure I've heard that they're completely dropping support for it XD
07-12-2020T02:31:18,FenceEqualizer,Unlike Picarto app you're putting in effort. So I hope you'll get up there.
07-12-2020T02:31:30,FenceEqualizer,Of course they are @_@
07-12-2020T02:31:33,w0lfmare,I just use a web browser. A shame really
07-12-2020T02:31:54,Dadrobit,"No shit, w0lf? That blows. Can't watch streams at work without it."
07-12-2020T02:32:16,w0lfmare,I use the web browser on my phone to watch
07-12-2020T02:33:08,FenceEqualizer,Crap that sucks. Hopfully they won't just flat out delete the app if they really do stop
07-12-2020T02:33:41,Dadrobit,Oh! Lookit that! It works on a mobile browser now!
07-12-2020T02:33:47,Dadrobit,Tmyk

07-12-2020T02:35:42,Dadrobit,I woulda rolled with the pun
07-12-2020T02:36:33,Dadrobit,"At least the browser version lets you mute the stream. That always annoyed me about the app, not having independent volume control."
07-12-2020T02:37:32,Dadrobit,"When the internet/stream is so bad that the music just stutters, it's just better to open up Spotify/YouTube and listen to your own stuff."
07-12-2020T02:38:26,w0lfmare,Looking good Kame!

07-12-2020T23:42:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I have a picture of all the rings I’ve got so far but I still have a tub of bombs to use
07-12-2020T23:42:54,CrRAR,Do they all fizzle or are the different?

07-12-2020T23:43:19,SpazztasticKiwi,they all fizzle but they’re different shapes colors n smellies

07-12-2020T23:44:34,CrRAR,:cherry_blossom:
07-12-2020T23:44:39,SpazztasticKiwi,each ring has a code to see its value but I haven’t searched any of them
07-12-2020T23:44:45,CrRAR,:bathtub:
07-12-2020T23:44:54,CrRAR,Ah
07-12-2020T23:45:05,SpazztasticKiwi,the reason for the codes is you have a chance to win a $10000 ring
07-12-2020T23:45:14,SpazztasticKiwi,and that makes my taxes cry
07-12-2020T23:45:15,CrRAR,Holy crap
07-12-2020T23:46:07,CrRAR,You’d have to claim a contest good as income though?
07-12-2020T23:46:19,SpazztasticKiwi,yeeeep
07-12-2020T23:46:27,SpazztasticKiwi,I read the terms and conditions
07-12-2020T23:46:48,CrRAR,"You just made me not want to win like anything, ever."
07-12-2020T23:47:05,CrRAR,before that hell yeah
07-12-2020T23:47:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"there’s a snowballs chance in hell Im one of the winners but with the amount of goodies I’ve got, I’ve at least got a ring or two worth $100"
07-12-2020T23:47:48,CrRAR,Are some just like actual real sterling or something?
07-12-2020T23:48:23,SpazztasticKiwi,there’s legit sterling yeah but they’re the $26 bath bombs & they say they’re sterling
07-12-2020T23:48:42,CrRAR,oh
07-12-2020T23:49:02,CrRAR,Wait are the rings paired at random?
07-12-2020T23:49:10,SpazztasticKiwi,"as for in general, there’s probably one you can win that’s got gold or sterling or low grade rocks in them"
07-12-2020T23:49:17,SpazztasticKiwi,they’re random
07-12-2020T23:49:50,CrRAR,"Ah yeah, so they distribute fair amount of all so they don’t lose money overall"
07-12-2020T23:50:15,CrRAR,Yeah some gem stones like even opal have value
07-12-2020T23:50:39,CrRAR,Tanzenite is that one?
07-12-2020T23:50:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"there’s $20, probably $50, $100, $1000, and the big  $10000"
07-12-2020T23:51:08,SpazztasticKiwi,"that they can be, maybe more but I don’t care to check"
07-12-2020T23:51:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I haven’t seen tanzanite
07-12-2020T23:53:22,SpazztasticKiwi,"but I know my libra ring & maybe my panda conservation ring has an opal stone, opal or sapphire for the libra"
07-12-2020T23:55:19,CrRAR,"oo, pretty"
07-12-2020T23:56:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"I also have a birthstone bomb, which will be one of 10-odd designs with opal"
