03-10-2020T15:46:34,CrimsonQuill,"Well...there is one variety, not many people know, that actually has quite a nice flavour."
03-10-2020T15:46:47,CrimsonQuill,The Irish grew it before the famine of the 1840s.
03-10-2020T15:47:02,CrimsonQuill,It was their staple diet...which is why the famine was so devastating.
03-10-2020T15:48:14,NezumiYuki,Oh yeah I almost forgot to mention...
03-10-2020T15:48:45,NezumiYuki,I'm deciding how to portray Sythe with his scythe for that halloween inspired image but I might try to turn it into a mini comic
03-10-2020T15:49:02,NezumiYuki,nothing concrete yet
03-10-2020T15:49:04,Glassan,"As a card & shillelagh carrying irish child, I too lament the potato famine."
03-10-2020T15:49:13,KeefMcDerpface,Which version? We came up with a few.
03-10-2020T15:49:23,CrimsonQuill,There is a town in Ireland called Shillelagh...
03-10-2020T15:49:28,CrimsonQuill,I've been there.
03-10-2020T15:49:43,CrimsonQuill,"It has a nice clock tower, and the Chocolate Garden isn't far away..."
03-10-2020T15:49:46,Glassan,Shows how important a good whupin' stick can be.
03-10-2020T15:50:01,CrimsonQuill,I think we have a shillelagh.
03-10-2020T15:50:23,NezumiYuki,"Well you guys came up with the sock puppet idea, and then tom kinda doodled a bit of that on the stream Friday, so idk whether to draw sythe's puppet self with a pizza scythe in hand, or just draw gardener sythe with a big ol' scythe"
03-10-2020T15:50:28,CrimsonQuill,"Honestly, I have an embarrassing confession to make about myself."
03-10-2020T15:50:50,Glassan,"I would choose the former, personally, Nezumi."
03-10-2020T15:50:54,AspiringNoodle,You like pineapple on pizza?
03-10-2020T15:50:56,CrimsonQuill,"I used to HATE my half-Irish heritage, simply because I decided I didn't want to learn it, or understand it."
03-10-2020T15:51:12,CrimsonQuill,@AspiringNoodle that too but that ain't embarrassing)
03-10-2020T15:51:35,CrimsonQuill,"I look at myself then and think, ""What an unadulterated ARSE."""
03-10-2020T15:52:02,Glassan,"That's not an unnatural thought, Crimson. :V"
03-10-2020T15:52:09,CrimsonQuill,"A few years ago, I was much more of an arse than I am now...realizing that was one of the things that made me want to read Twokinds."
03-10-2020T15:52:24,CrimsonQuill,It's also why I like Red as a character so much.
03-10-2020T15:52:40,CrimsonQuill,He's a lot like me.
03-10-2020T15:52:52,CrimsonQuill,"An arse, but capable of changing for the better."
03-10-2020T15:52:58,CrimsonQuill,Of being a nicer person.
03-10-2020T15:53:11,NezumiYuki,You mean you can throw S'plody fireballs? Crimson?   xD
03-10-2020T15:53:15,NezumiYuki,Kidding of course!
03-10-2020T15:53:21,CrimsonQuill,I wish
03-10-2020T15:53:24,NezumiYuki,xDD
03-10-2020T15:53:32,CrimsonQuill,Splodey fireballs would be handy in winter!
03-10-2020T15:53:39,NezumiYuki,Oh I bet!
03-10-2020T15:53:54,KeefMcDerpface,Oh! Maybe Sythe is telling a scary storying and is using the sock puppet to tell it. And it swaps from Him and the sock puppet to him as the gardener.
03-10-2020T15:53:55,Glassan,But you can throw fireballs if you try hard enough.
03-10-2020T15:54:03,Glassan,Fire marshal mite b mad tho
03-10-2020T15:54:05,CrimsonQuill,Aheheh
03-10-2020T15:54:32,CrimsonQuill,I don't know why but that just makes me think about that quote from Chesty Puller.
03-10-2020T15:54:42,Glassan,Which one?
03-10-2020T15:56:49,CrimsonQuill,"""All right, they're on our left, they're on our right, they're behind us, they're in front of us...They can't get away this time."""
03-10-2020T15:57:03,CrimsonQuill,That has to be one of the most INSPIRATIONAL quotes I've ever seen.
03-10-2020T15:57:54,Glassan,This is true. That one is one of my favorites.
03-10-2020T15:58:34,Glassan,"I always liked how that man was all ""I'm not stuck in here with you, you're stuck in here with ME!"" >:V"
03-10-2020T15:58:48,CrimsonQuill,The ultimate role reversal.
03-10-2020T15:58:50,CrimsonQuill,And it's true.
03-10-2020T15:59:03,CrimsonQuill,"When cornered, with nothing to lose, any creature is at it's most deadly."
03-10-2020T15:59:40,CrimsonQuill,"To quote Obelix from 'Asterix and the Black Gold' : ""These Romans are crazy! I'm at my best with my back to the wall!"""

03-10-2020T22:38:01,CrRAR,clever grrrl
03-10-2020T22:38:05,SpazztasticKiwi,and that she was the original intended resident of the tomb

03-10-2020T22:39:08,Roughlandin,Well that probably got thrown out the window when her husband banned all the gods and installed his own. NOT a very popular guy.

03-10-2020T22:55:57,CrRAR,the jaw bit?
03-10-2020T22:56:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"but looking at it personally, it doesn‚Äôt look like her teeth were busted"
03-10-2020T22:56:14,Roughlandin,Yeah something to keep his blood circulating. It looked like a big red mechanical squid
03-10-2020T22:56:45,CrRAR,mmm
03-10-2020T22:56:48,SpazztasticKiwi,it looks more like the face caved in there after mummification  time
03-10-2020T22:57:16,CrRAR,"yeah, she looks kinda ok"
03-10-2020T22:57:17,Roughlandin,Most of it wasn't even that bad. Then they pulled out the cauterizer gun. Then there was a smell I will never be able to unsmell. THAT was what made me a little faint

03-10-2020T23:21:40,Ordithus,maybe.  but definitely that social things like that really suffer in a pandemic like this
03-10-2020T23:21:48,Ordithus,I miss when pandemic was a board game
03-10-2020T23:22:30,AspiringNoodle,I'm tired of serving people who don't wear masks or are too stupid to realize they're wearing it wrong :|
