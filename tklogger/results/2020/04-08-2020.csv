04-08-2020T00:00:16,AspiringNoodle,It's about generating as much money as possible for all time
04-08-2020T00:00:21,CrRAR,In gaming cos it was the originality
04-08-2020T00:00:38,CrRAR,“Too expensive to innovate”

04-08-2020T00:01:30,AspiringNoodle,I'm gonna love watching the investors and shareholders cry when loot boxes are banned globally
04-08-2020T00:01:31,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-clovischuckle:
04-08-2020T00:01:48,AspiringNoodle,loot boxes have generated insane amounts of profit for gaming companies
04-08-2020T00:02:01,AspiringNoodle,"But they are literal gambling and exposed to kids, so what else would happen?"
04-08-2020T00:02:44,CrRAR,"That’s mostly what they want, kids get mommies and daddies credit cards and spenf frivioulusly"
04-08-2020T00:03:09,CrRAR,...or point cards or whatever
04-08-2020T00:03:18,AspiringNoodle,Europe is going to do it first
04-08-2020T00:03:35,AspiringNoodle,"Several nations have already banned loot boxes in games, and more are on the verge of doing so"
04-08-2020T00:03:40,CrRAR,"Yeah, they are pretty common senseical"
04-08-2020T00:04:06,AspiringNoodle,What would make me extra happy is if global governments took these companies to court
04-08-2020T00:04:21,AspiringNoodle,Fined them tens to hundreds of millions in damages for their unethical behavior
04-08-2020T00:04:40,CrRAR,"Yeah, but no money in THAAAAT"
04-08-2020T00:04:49,AspiringNoodle,The industry is defending loot boxes tooth and nail
04-08-2020T00:04:58,CrRAR,Yup
04-08-2020T00:05:05,AspiringNoodle,"It's pretty clear they know that they're in the wrong on everything, but the cash flow is too damn good"
04-08-2020T00:05:40,AspiringNoodle,"So they'd rather fight for that small chance that they can keep these things legal, rather than roll over and admit fault"
04-08-2020T00:06:00,CrRAR,"Yeah, won’t change if the measure of success if money"
04-08-2020T00:06:08,CrRAR,*is
04-08-2020T00:08:07,CrRAR,"It’s funny when you take the product out of the picture and you realize an economy is just a bunch of people tricking each other into giving eachother money for shiny, sparkly things."

04-08-2020T00:09:12,CrRAR,Stupid brains
04-08-2020T00:09:32,AspiringNoodle,"I'm the opposite, lol"
04-08-2020T00:09:44,CrRAR,Smart brains?
04-08-2020T00:09:48,CrRAR,Those are rare
04-08-2020T00:09:57,AspiringNoodle,I like my entertainment
04-08-2020T00:10:12,AspiringNoodle,"But as for owning ""fancy things"".  I like what I like."
04-08-2020T00:10:22,CrRAR,Indeed :ctwokinds-daydreamingkat:
04-08-2020T00:10:30,CrRAR,Just an observation
04-08-2020T00:10:37,AspiringNoodle,"No joke, super / hypercars are neat and all"
04-08-2020T00:10:48,AspiringNoodle,But I *really* like the body of 1970's mustangs and such
04-08-2020T00:10:52,CrRAR,Gettin philosophical
04-08-2020T00:10:59,CrRAR,Yeah
04-08-2020T00:11:10,CrRAR,They classy
04-08-2020T00:11:12,AspiringNoodle,"In one of the Forza games I own, my primary car is a Shelby Cobra"
04-08-2020T00:11:25,AspiringNoodle,Literally just dump all my cash into upgrading that thing
04-08-2020T00:11:31,CrRAR,Haha
04-08-2020T00:11:48,CrRAR,The new ones are kinda goofy
04-08-2020T00:11:55,AspiringNoodle,But my point stands
04-08-2020T00:12:03,AspiringNoodle,I don't *need* the fanciest stuff
04-08-2020T00:12:11,CrRAR,I liked the mid 2010 ones though too
04-08-2020T00:12:16,AspiringNoodle,"If it looks good an functions well, I don't need some money dump"
04-08-2020T00:12:56,CrRAR,Oh yeah find the best compromise of good stuff to money ratio
04-08-2020T00:13:44,AspiringNoodle,"I don't play the lottery anymore, but if I did, I would maybe have some of the after-tax money as spending money"
04-08-2020T00:13:54,AspiringNoodle,But invest the rest and live off the passive income
04-08-2020T00:14:04,AspiringNoodle,if I did win*
04-08-2020T00:14:27,AspiringNoodle,"And if that proves to be too much, start donating"
04-08-2020T00:14:45,AspiringNoodle,Maybe start shifting investments to promising up and coming companies
04-08-2020T00:15:08,AspiringNoodle,"Don't need a yacht, I don't really care for / want to be on boats"
04-08-2020T00:15:27,AspiringNoodle,Don't need a private jet.  Giant waste of space / emissions nightmare
04-08-2020T00:16:04,CrRAR,Personal resort island pretty legit
04-08-2020T00:16:13,AspiringNoodle,"Meh, boring"
04-08-2020T00:16:20,CrRAR,Evil lair?
04-08-2020T00:16:22,AspiringNoodle,"Would rather play games / make stuff, lol"
04-08-2020T00:16:40,AspiringNoodle,"Hell, there's an idea... art college"
04-08-2020T00:16:56,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-keith8D::paintbrush:
04-08-2020T00:17:00,AspiringNoodle,"A good one that doesn't run students $160,000 - $240,000 over 4 years"
04-08-2020T00:18:59,CrRAR,"The thing that still bothers me is that, while providing rigor to refine yourself, take tom for example, college itself isn’t going to gurantee you develop a style or anything you’re not already capable of."
04-08-2020T00:19:02,AspiringNoodle,"Oof... apparently building a college can be upwards of $2,000,000,000"
04-08-2020T00:19:19,CrRAR,Some people do thrive in the school environment.
04-08-2020T00:19:20,AspiringNoodle,But that all depends on size / scope
04-08-2020T00:21:10,CrRAR,"School is a good way to find some people who might know what they’re talking about to get you a credential into corporate america, but make sure you bring a passion... or at least hope you bring one that is compatible with what the market is looking for."
04-08-2020T00:21:45,AspiringNoodle,"I would argue that an art school is an effective way to get you to try out many things, and find what you like and what you are good at"
04-08-2020T00:21:56,AspiringNoodle,And then get you to focus on that and improve your skill in a timely fashion
04-08-2020T00:21:57,CrRAR,Yeah
04-08-2020T00:22:26,AspiringNoodle,A primary example of this is 3d animation
04-08-2020T00:22:42,AspiringNoodle,"Most art colleges will tech you everything.  Modelling, rigging, animation, lighting & effects"
04-08-2020T00:22:55,CrRAR,"Yeah, certain higher order things it’s tough to get exposed to"
04-08-2020T00:23:04,CrRAR,Even the tools
04-08-2020T00:23:07,AspiringNoodle,But you need to specialize to get a career.  Although there are paths where you can make it as a generalist
04-08-2020T00:23:28,AspiringNoodle,"That's why there are services such as animation mentor / iAnimate / bloop, that specialize in character animation"
04-08-2020T00:24:39,CrRAR,"That’s why access and net neutrality are important, WHY is it that there is a $XX,000 gate on learning skills YOU NEED to compete and participate in society?"
04-08-2020T00:25:04,CrRAR,It’s like a purposeful limit to maintain classism
04-08-2020T00:25:07,AspiringNoodle,"Also, uni's get you access to industry software included in the tuition :P"
04-08-2020T00:25:13,CrRAR,Yup
04-08-2020T00:25:17,AspiringNoodle,"So not only do you learn things in a focused manner, you get access to the relevant tools"
04-08-2020T00:25:59,CrRAR,"It’s like “YOU paid the troll toll, now you have the privilege of TRYING to make something out of yourself”"
04-08-2020T00:26:03,CrRAR,xD
04-08-2020T00:27:35,CrRAR,"Like really, it’s all just bluster and misdirect for money being incorrectly allocated at the top."
04-08-2020T00:28:27,CrRAR,"“You peasants can squabble, while we induldge~”"
04-08-2020T00:30:51,CrRAR,"But yeah it costs to establish and run a college, what should happen eventually though is they become so commonplace as highschools or something"
04-08-2020T00:31:21,CrRAR,Then thats when SUPERcollege becomes a thing
04-08-2020T00:32:18,CrRAR,"I think the prestige they have is no longer deserved, at least not in exchange for higher cost."
04-08-2020T00:32:18,AspiringNoodle,"Arguably, at some point college will become the new high school"
04-08-2020T00:32:33,CrRAR,yeah
04-08-2020T00:32:37,AspiringNoodle,"In the past, school in general was something for the upper class"
04-08-2020T00:32:47,CrRAR,yup
04-08-2020T00:32:49,AspiringNoodle,But it was decided that a K-12 education was something that everyone deserved
04-08-2020T00:33:27,AspiringNoodle,"Given the increasing necessity of degrees to get a ""living wage"", at some point we can no longer justify the absurd increases in costs"
04-08-2020T00:33:56,CrRAR,"Tbh, I really don’t see how colleges are treated as ‘prestegios’ and ‘sophisticated’ when EVERYONE knows what college life is actually like."
04-08-2020T00:34:14,CrRAR,‘prestigious’

04-08-2020T21:53:57,AspiringNoodle,Apparently there's a group out there that already has a suggestion
04-08-2020T21:54:14,CrRAR,Worker co-ops are becoming a bigger trend
04-08-2020T21:54:28,CrRAR,Like employee owned workplaces
04-08-2020T21:54:36,AspiringNoodle,CEO can only earn 100x as much as the lowest paid employee.
04-08-2020T21:54:56,AspiringNoodle,"So if bobby kotick wants to keep making 40,000,000+ in compensation, his ""cheapest"" employee better be making 400k a year"

04-08-2020T21:57:10,AspiringNoodle,That you need to cap how much a CEO or anyone else can make in compensation relative to the lowest paid employees
04-08-2020T21:57:34,AspiringNoodle,Because in activision Blizzard's case... they will pay you as little as possible so they can funnel all the extra money into the pockets at the top
04-08-2020T21:57:47,CrRAR,...like her tail
04-08-2020T21:57:49,CrRAR,:
04-08-2020T21:57:52,CrRAR,:3
04-08-2020T21:58:08,Ordithus,check out how german corporations work - the board has membership representing the employees
04-08-2020T21:58:21,AspiringNoodle,We need to get laws changed for that to work
04-08-2020T21:58:42,AspiringNoodle,"As it stands, the courts have determined that the company exists onlyt o make money for the investors / shareholders"
04-08-2020T21:58:52,Ordithus,thanks ford v dodge
04-08-2020T21:59:08,AspiringNoodle,So that precedent needs to be overturned right effing now
04-08-2020T21:59:25,AspiringNoodle,"It's impossible to build a publicly traded company on the idea of health, sustained, long-term growth"
04-08-2020T21:59:29,CrRAR,ah that actually makes sense
04-08-2020T21:59:42,AspiringNoodle,"The greedy pigs will just sue to remove you, and will keep doing so until they get someone who will play ball"
04-08-2020T21:59:56,CrRAR,Cuz American high-skilled labor has absolutely zero unions
04-08-2020T22:00:06,CrRAR,"You literally ""fight for yourself"""
04-08-2020T22:00:12,AspiringNoodle,"Remove that precedent, then they can't remove you just because theyd on't like how you're running the company"
04-08-2020T22:00:22,AspiringNoodle,That opens the door for CEO's who want the company to grow in a healthy way
04-08-2020T22:00:24,CrRAR,Like what college educated person thought that was a good idea?
04-08-2020T22:00:29,Ordithus,yeah professional unions are very rare
04-08-2020T22:00:31,AspiringNoodle,Not exponential indefinite growth
04-08-2020T22:01:01,Ordithus,I've only been half joking for years of unionizing the engineers at my company
04-08-2020T22:01:01,CrRAR,Like the fact that highly skilled people accept they don't have strength in numbers is crazy
04-08-2020T22:01:20,CrRAR,I understnsd the idea of individual bargaining and whatever
04-08-2020T22:01:28,Ordithus,mostly it's the lack of support and that I'm lazy
04-08-2020T22:01:30,AspiringNoodle,"After we can open the door for CEO's who think long term, we can start working on flushing the boards of greedy individuals who support the status quo"
04-08-2020T22:01:47,CrRAR,but it's like they gave up the ability to fight as a whole in exchange for selling their soul
04-08-2020T22:01:53,AspiringNoodle,We can open the way for getting employee approved board members
04-08-2020T22:02:06,SpazztasticKiwi,has this conversation not been run into the ground yet already
04-08-2020T22:02:16,Ordithus,it's on its way to the core
