08-02-2020T16:30:55,Roughlandin,Yeah its running late
08-02-2020T16:30:56,Sammit,Hi Brocade
08-02-2020T16:31:00,ThingsAreMoving,Stream soon™
08-02-2020T16:31:03,ThingsAreMoving,today
08-02-2020T16:31:08,Roughlandin,Tom slept in and has to do human stuff before streaming
08-02-2020T16:31:13,ThingsAreMoving,possibly in the next hour
08-02-2020T16:31:33,Roughlandin,He has to do dumb stuff like eat and shower excrete waste
08-02-2020T16:31:45,Roughlandin,not IN the shower
08-02-2020T16:31:49,Roughlandin,Just to be clear
08-02-2020T16:31:52,ThingsAreMoving,and tally up the votes
08-02-2020T16:32:17,ThingsAreMoving,normal human stuff to do at 3pm
08-02-2020T16:32:19,Roughlandin,So was that poll just to narrow down the votes or is that how we're deciding winners this week?
08-02-2020T16:32:31,ThingsAreMoving,that's the vote for this week
08-02-2020T16:32:34,Roughlandin,Ah
08-02-2020T16:32:41,Roughlandin,Glad I did it then lol
08-02-2020T16:33:19,ThingsAreMoving,"It's a bit confusing when we go back and forth from two methods of voting, but honestly I think this one is more fair to all the people on patreon"
08-02-2020T16:33:27,ThingsAreMoving,More work for the man himself though
08-02-2020T16:33:51,Roughlandin,True

08-02-2020T16:35:02,Roughlandin,Also (and not to dox but I'm pretty sure this is public knowledge) doesn't Tom live in Ohio? Aka my time zone. Boy DID sleep in late
08-02-2020T16:35:08,TeapotOfDoom,oh there was an omni poll
08-02-2020T16:35:13,ThingsAreMoving,There are pros and cons to both methods. We'll find some balance eventually
08-02-2020T16:35:28,TeapotOfDoom,i think using both is the best
08-02-2020T16:35:41,ThingsAreMoving,Tom lives in Cincinnati. I think that's in Ohio?
08-02-2020T16:35:53,Roughlandin,Yeah mostly
08-02-2020T16:35:56,BadFoMo,It is.
08-02-2020T16:35:59,TeapotOfDoom,"cause sometimes you get the advantages of one, othertimes the other"
08-02-2020T16:36:16,TeapotOfDoom,grub config is pissing me of
08-02-2020T16:36:27,Roughlandin,Unless you're from Newport. Which is in Kentucky but everyone just treats like Cincinnatti anyway
08-02-2020T16:37:42,ThingsAreMoving,It's nice to have a massive country with one language. EU tries to be a similar thing but wherever you go there's a different language
08-02-2020T16:38:09,Orthonox,Hello everyone. Are there any plans for a stream today?
08-02-2020T16:38:14,ThingsAreMoving,Imagine how much humankind would benefit from an unified language
08-02-2020T16:38:17,SpazztasticKiwi,you think that’s Ohio

08-02-2020T16:42:23,Roughlandin,"It's okay, Things. In most of the US they don't consider my Kentucky accent to be English either"

08-02-2020T17:08:02,ProsePro7,I really prefer the stream poll
08-02-2020T17:08:07,Roughlandin,The thirstiest of suggests rise to the top. Scoopin up that cream

08-02-2020T17:09:04,Roughlandin,We are the pervy children you made us Thomas
08-02-2020T17:09:05,CrimsonQuill,"Like you said, Eric's suggestions would't be that different to what happens normally"

08-02-2020T17:11:17,Roughlandin,"Welp, the vote is there"
08-02-2020T17:11:27,CrimsonQuill,I will say...I personally am not the most comfortable with the Clovis pics.
08-02-2020T17:11:36,Roughlandin,Democracy at work folks!
08-02-2020T17:11:36,CrimsonQuill,"In my mind, they blur just how monstrous he can be."
08-02-2020T17:11:40,MuonNeutrino,yeah
08-02-2020T17:11:40,Rolley,I just got to a power outlet so I’m good
08-02-2020T17:11:45,MuonNeutrino,i don't like him either
08-02-2020T17:11:49,Roughlandin,Characters can be complex!... and sexy
08-02-2020T17:11:51,grew,helloo
08-02-2020T17:11:57,Twokinds,I've seen suggestions get slightly reworded and suddenly get way more votes even though it's the same idea
08-02-2020T17:11:59,dexgoloco,Anyone know which one he’s working on?
08-02-2020T17:12:02,Twokinds,Wording can have a big impact.

08-02-2020T17:12:22,tehbear,w0rd
08-02-2020T17:12:24,HoverdudeXL,Yea i suppose that is true
08-02-2020T17:12:24,ThingsAreMoving,I will repeat it again: Clovis deserves a high five. With a brick. To the face.
08-02-2020T17:12:25,CrimsonQuill,"When I see a monster in fiction and real life-even someone as charismatic as Pagan Min in Farcry 4, or GLaDOS from Portal..."
08-02-2020T17:12:32,Roughlandin,"Put some spice on it, y'all. Jazz up them suggests"
08-02-2020T17:12:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"I know, I’m wondering if mine was too reliant on people knowing what “vaguely familiar Norse hammer” meant"
08-02-2020T17:12:37,CrimsonQuill,While they are in their own ways awesome...they are still monsters
08-02-2020T17:12:41,CrimsonQuill,Some more than others

08-02-2020T17:12:50,CrimsonQuill,"Some were twisted cruelly, forced down the path..."
08-02-2020T17:12:51,Mippy,Time to enjoy the magic of microwave burritos and orange Fanta
08-02-2020T17:12:57,BadFoMo,"This whole poll this has got me thinking, how would the poll look if you sorted them from most ot least likely to do, Tom?"
08-02-2020T17:12:57,MuonNeutrino,"i think the thing about clovis is that 'sexy', at least for me, depends on more than looks - i can't forget how evil clovis is, no matter what he looks like"
08-02-2020T17:13:02,CrimsonQuill,And some were...monstrous to begin with
08-02-2020T17:13:02,ShamusTheFox,"Like ""Fight For Cancer"" versus ""Fight Against Cancer."" Sometimes it's phrasing."
08-02-2020T17:13:05,ThingsAreMoving,"Enjoy your noms, Mippy"
08-02-2020T17:13:10,ThingsAreMoving,No sour cream though?

08-02-2020T17:13:42,CrimsonHelsing,"I agree badfo, that does beg the question, Tom"
08-02-2020T17:13:43,MuonNeutrino,this is probably the first suggestion

08-02-2020T17:14:14,Roughlandin,That sounds dirty
08-02-2020T17:14:15,dexgoloco,Thank you
08-02-2020T17:14:17,CrimsonQuill,I made some at my house

08-02-2020T17:14:35,tehbear,kompot is good with cream
08-02-2020T17:14:41,Mippy,I sent that like a fancy word for  jam?
08-02-2020T17:14:46,CrimsonQuill,Nah
08-02-2020T17:14:47,ThingsAreMoving,it's basically a fruit punch
08-02-2020T17:14:49,CrimsonQuill,It's a drink
08-02-2020T17:14:52,JojoF2415,It’s a beverage
08-02-2020T17:14:54,CrimsonQuill,Boil water
08-02-2020T17:14:57,tehbear,or a desert
08-02-2020T17:14:59,CrimsonQuill,Put the fruit in and simmer

08-02-2020T17:15:03,JojoF2415,I just searched it up
08-02-2020T17:15:05,CrimsonQuill,Add enough sugar for diabetes
08-02-2020T17:15:06,CrimsonQuill,Add honey
08-02-2020T17:15:18,JojoF2415,No thanks too much sugar
08-02-2020T17:15:18,CrimsonQuill,Add Lemon juice so you don't feel the sugar overdose when it hits
08-02-2020T17:15:22,tehbear,the kompot thickens
08-02-2020T17:15:22,Sibernethy,Dragonfruit Kompot

08-02-2020T17:15:39,ThingsAreMoving,You should only add sugar when it needs it
08-02-2020T17:15:48,CrimsonQuill,"Well, I added half a cup"
08-02-2020T17:15:57,CrimsonQuill,I followed the recipe on Life of Boris' channel

08-02-2020T17:33:55,Zakuru,other species of wolf besides the standard grey wolf
08-02-2020T17:34:04,microbuss,I got banned from a stream cause I kept catching mice in sticky traps  & throwing them in the trash ugh
08-02-2020T17:34:24,MuonNeutrino,"well, all of the wolves we've seen so far seem to be pretty similar overall, i would say they're all roughly based on canis lupis"
08-02-2020T17:34:40,KeefMcDerpface,Nibs!
08-02-2020T17:34:41,MuonNeutrino,certainly dont see any huge differences that would cause me to think some of them are based on other canid species
08-02-2020T17:34:48,Roughlandin,I knew a kid that got suspended for cooking bacon in class

08-02-2020T17:35:16,Roughlandin,A George Foreman grill
08-02-2020T17:35:17,MuonNeutrino,all of the things that would be actually different species in RL seem to also be treated as distinct in TK as well - e.g. dogs and foxes are considered separate groupings from wolves
08-02-2020T17:35:34,Zakuru,"example, mexican wolf, indian wolf, and ref wolf"
08-02-2020T17:35:36,microbuss,was it his?
08-02-2020T17:35:38,Roughlandin,It was like the week before graduation
08-02-2020T17:35:41,MuonNeutrino,those are subspecies
08-02-2020T17:35:45,MuonNeutrino,not species
08-02-2020T17:35:49,ContagiousBordem16,No
08-02-2020T17:35:52,KeefMcDerpface,Ref wolf?
08-02-2020T17:35:53,Zakuru,ya get the idea though
08-02-2020T17:35:56,MuonNeutrino,with the possible exception of the red wolf (people don't agree on those)
08-02-2020T17:36:00,Roughlandin,So he decided to bring in a grill and bacon as a prank
08-02-2020T17:36:12,Zakuru,i figured if there were... they'd be their own tribe since arctic wolves have their own territory
08-02-2020T17:36:15,microbuss,well i cook my bacon on a GF grill

08-02-2020T17:36:55,tehbear,if he made a breakfast as good as Things he might have gotten away with it
08-02-2020T17:36:55,Zakuru,...besides that
08-02-2020T17:37:01,MuonNeutrino,we haven't really seen enough different forest wolves to really say if there are different subgroups among them
08-02-2020T17:37:04,Brocade,there goes Nibbly!
08-02-2020T17:37:18,tehbear,theres white wolf wine

08-02-2020T17:37:39,MuonNeutrino,"there are certainly different-looking coats on some of hte ones we've seen, but RL wolves have different coats among the same subspecies too"
08-02-2020T17:38:19,Avolendi,If the coat is different on their arms in the TK verse. Does that mean they have a different coat-of-arms?
