12-04-2020T00:00:23,AspiringNoodle,We have an 80+ year old man who spends his days just driving around to different places and playing instant lottery
12-04-2020T00:00:38,AspiringNoodle,His routine hasn't changed due to COVID
12-04-2020T00:00:52,AspiringNoodle,Prime example of how this will be so much more painful than it need to
12-04-2020T00:01:44,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve learned a family I know is going through 6 tubs of butter a month
12-04-2020T00:02:46,johnnytho,There was a clip of cops busting down a block party around where I live. People still had the nerve to get aggressive with the cops
12-04-2020T00:20:17,AspiringNoodle,LMAO
12-04-2020T00:20:27,AspiringNoodle,Playing the Warzone BR for call of duty
12-04-2020T00:20:35,AspiringNoodle,Just bullied a guy with a giant military truck
12-04-2020T00:20:44,AspiringNoodle,caught him trying to outrun the ring.  Ran him over eventually
12-04-2020T00:20:48,AspiringNoodle,"Dude's name is ""Wifebeater"""
12-04-2020T00:21:18,AspiringNoodle,I'm dying :ptv-laugh:
12-04-2020T00:22:45,SpazztasticKiwi,I might try putting out feeders for squirrels outside my window
12-04-2020T00:23:45,SpazztasticKiwi,but I live in the woods so I‚Äôd hate to wake up to squirrelmagedden
12-04-2020T00:24:30,SpazztasticKiwi,open the window to all the beady little eyes like ‚Äúbring us the corn‚Äù
12-04-2020T00:24:35,AspiringNoodle,DO EET
12-04-2020T00:24:44,AspiringNoodle,"Also, why can't I find a BR I'm completely happy with? :c"
12-04-2020T00:25:06,AspiringNoodle,"Like, Fortnite looks great, runs great, but the pacing is really damn slow, and I'm not sure how I feel about the building"
12-04-2020T00:25:31,AspiringNoodle,"Apex Legends, again, looks great, runs great, but there's so much more inventory management, and the pacing can be slow as all heck, or no end."
12-04-2020T00:25:58,AspiringNoodle,"Move over to call of duty, and this thing is all over the place with the framerate"
12-04-2020T00:26:15,AspiringNoodle,"That said, running ""Wifebeater"" over with a giant military truck has made my night"
12-04-2020T00:30:33,KeefMcDerpface,"Would have been better if you ran them over with the helicopter. Actually, can you roadkill some with a helicopter in COD like you can in BF."
12-04-2020T00:31:30,KeefMcDerpface,"Sh*t, I legit don't know if you can."
12-04-2020T00:32:23,SonOfGoku,Only one way to find out
12-04-2020T00:33:11,KeefMcDerpface,Get to the chopper.
12-04-2020T00:38:59,Dadrobit,I feel kinda proud. Taught my dad how to get a good narration recording and he's gotten really good at creating clean recordings.
12-04-2020T00:45:43,AspiringNoodle,...
12-04-2020T00:45:53,AspiringNoodle,Maybe I should try playing some CoD tomorrow after a fresh restart
12-04-2020T00:46:04,AspiringNoodle,All the stuff I have running now may be messing up the framerate
12-04-2020T00:46:15,AspiringNoodle,"If the framerate is still dodgy, I'll just give up on it"
12-04-2020T00:46:53,AspiringNoodle,I don't like playing games that aren't stable.  Gave up OW for a bit until they fixed the crashing issues
12-04-2020T00:51:53,KeefMcDerpface,:ptv-sleepy:
12-04-2020T00:54:46,SpazztasticKiwi,does thatmake him dad^2?
12-04-2020T00:55:05,SpazztasticKiwi,or are you dad^2
12-04-2020T00:55:42,SpazztasticKiwi,"also, my favorite part of golf with friends is the incoherent rants of death towards playmates"

12-04-2020T01:50:04,Dadrobit,"Ha, thought you were gonna call me out for having a witches cackle."

12-04-2020T01:52:52,SpazztasticKiwi,only description I remember of your laugh is a hysterical seagull choking on its own vomit
12-04-2020T01:55:06,Dadrobit,"Nah, not really. Just recalled you were in chat with us when I double tapped the shit outta Marv and about had a fit."
12-04-2020T01:55:55,Dadrobit,The seagull moment was when I was doing the pterodactyl/velociraptor sound.
12-04-2020T02:10:37,SpazztasticKiwi,dude I swear you almost choked on the giggles back then
12-04-2020T02:11:14,SpazztasticKiwi,"google, is it possible to over-laugh?"

12-04-2020T12:39:29,CrimsonQuill,Meh
12-04-2020T12:39:54,CrimsonQuill,I learned about Twokinds the same time I got into Markipler
12-04-2020T12:40:09,CrimsonQuill,My friend told me about Markiplier after I'd discovered Jacksepticeye
12-04-2020T12:40:15,CrimsonQuill,And said his brother did a webcomic
12-04-2020T12:40:22,ThoseButterflys,hah
12-04-2020T12:40:30,CrimsonQuill,"I looked at a page, but at the time, I felt I probably should leave it"
12-04-2020T12:40:52,CrimsonQuill,It was the page where Kathrin was almost crushed by burning wreckage in chapter 18
12-04-2020T12:41:02,CrimsonQuill,I thought at the time it was an underground mine
12-04-2020T12:41:09,CrimsonQuill,That was...2016?
12-04-2020T12:41:15,CrimsonQuill,Then I came back christmas 2017
12-04-2020T12:41:30,CrimsonQuill,Admittedly the first 9 chapters were tricky to read through
12-04-2020T12:41:47,CrimsonQuill,But after the Basitin Islands saga I read the entirity of the comic in an afternoon
12-04-2020T12:42:06,CrimsonQuill,"I must have re-read it at least 10 times now, including this one."
12-04-2020T12:42:14,CrimsonQuill,I'm on chapter 19 tonight
12-04-2020T12:42:17,CrimsonQuill,20 tomorrow
12-04-2020T12:42:30,ThoseButterflys,God 3 months ago I found the comic and read the entire comic from the beginning t now in 2 days
12-04-2020T12:43:13,CrimsonQuill,Wheesh
12-04-2020T12:44:03,ThoseButterflys,I have only found a few comics and books that I accualy like
12-04-2020T12:44:25,CrimsonQuill,"Well, after Twokinds i went looking to see what other webcomics there were."
12-04-2020T12:44:30,CrimsonQuill,Hunters of Salamanstra
12-04-2020T12:44:35,CrimsonQuill,The Whiteboard
12-04-2020T12:44:38,CrimsonQuill,Freefall
12-04-2020T12:44:43,CrimsonQuill,Lackdaisy
12-04-2020T12:45:24,ThoseButterflys,I'm assuming they all have the same kind of art style as twokinds
12-04-2020T12:45:49,CrimsonQuill,No
12-04-2020T12:45:52,CrimsonQuill,Very different
12-04-2020T12:46:13,ThoseButterflys,I see
12-04-2020T12:46:14,CrimsonQuill,Freefall and The Whiteboard are kind of like newspaper strips in style
12-04-2020T12:46:47,CrimsonQuill,Hunters of Salamanstra has its own unique manga style (And buckets of blood and gore from the monsters)
12-04-2020T12:47:01,CrimsonQuill,And LackDaisy is the Prohibition Era with cats
12-04-2020T12:47:58,ThoseButterflys,I like the luckdaisy style

12-04-2020T12:48:12,CrimsonQuill,I still haven't finished it yet

12-04-2020T12:48:21,CrimsonQuill,But I like comics
12-04-2020T12:48:37,CrimsonQuill,When I was younger I would read my Dad's 2000 AD Books
12-04-2020T12:48:39,ThoseButterflys,gotta make it last

12-04-2020T12:49:10,CrimsonQuill,And of course I read LOTS of Calvin and Hobbes
12-04-2020T12:50:00,CrimsonQuill,Discovered Halo and Warhammer 40000 the summer of 2017
12-04-2020T12:50:07,CrimsonQuill,A few months before Twokinds
12-04-2020T12:51:21,ThoseButterflys,What is this Heracy
12-04-2020T12:51:42,CrimsonQuill,My existence.
12-04-2020T12:51:44,CrimsonQuill,My life.
12-04-2020T12:51:49,CrimsonQuill,My dreams and aspirations.

12-04-2020T13:13:22,CrimsonQuill,Badly
12-04-2020T13:13:24,CrimsonQuill,6 kills
12-04-2020T13:13:30,CrimsonQuill,probably twice as many deaths
12-04-2020T13:13:40,CrimsonQuill,Two members of blue team had 12 apiece
12-04-2020T13:13:46,CrimsonQuill,Guy on my team had 36
12-04-2020T13:13:48,CrimsonQuill,SWAT
12-04-2020T13:13:52,SonOfGoku,At least it was fun
12-04-2020T13:13:53,CrimsonQuill,The magnum may be a sniper
12-04-2020T13:13:59,CrimsonQuill,But it is for the skilled

12-04-2020T13:23:18,CrimsonQuill,A sort of brownish orange
12-04-2020T13:23:22,CrimsonQuill,I'll be honest
12-04-2020T13:23:28,CrimsonQuill,I can see the colours he uses mysel
12-04-2020T13:23:30,JojoGD,I have to combine two colors which are YR21 and Y19 to make a color similar to it
12-04-2020T13:23:57,CrimsonQuill,I just find it hard to figure out what the colours I am looking at even ARE
12-04-2020T13:24:06,CrimsonQuill,Therein lies the rub.

12-04-2020T14:01:08,AspiringNoodle,Guess whatever I had up yesterday was REALLY messing with Warzone
12-04-2020T14:01:19,AspiringNoodle,My framerates are easily 20+ fps higher
12-04-2020T14:01:26,AspiringNoodle,There's no wild swings
12-04-2020T14:01:39,AspiringNoodle,And I was able to crank up the shadow quality and not lose like 90% of my frames
12-04-2020T14:21:02,CrimsonQuill,What game is this Warzone in?
12-04-2020T14:23:28,CrimsonQuill,Because the only Warzone I know is Warzone Firefight from Halo 5 (which I haven't even played)
