19-09-2020T15:38:58,CrimsonQuill,I thought it was a whisper
19-09-2020T15:39:02,CrimsonQuill,Please have mercy
19-09-2020T15:39:11,Ordithus,Since you panicked and all
19-09-2020T15:39:13,BadFoMo,@Avolendi Yes and I guess so.
19-09-2020T15:39:24,Roughlandin,I mean technically it's a link to Tom's material

19-09-2020T15:39:41,CrimsonQuill,I'm just scared whenever that happens
19-09-2020T15:39:43,TeapotOfDoom,was just the maze stuff i guess
19-09-2020T15:39:50,K3IDRAN,howlong did it take you to make that maze tom/
19-09-2020T15:39:54,TeapotOfDoom,so no reason to panick
19-09-2020T15:40:04,CrimsonQuill,"Aheheh, yeah...no reason to panic.."
19-09-2020T15:40:17,Roughlandin,Then Quill got banned forever

19-09-2020T15:42:58,Roughlandin,Isn't that what happened to Gandalf? He had to make an alt account to finish the quest

19-09-2020T15:44:42,ThingsAreMoving,Jade with a banhammer seems like a natural pairing
19-09-2020T15:44:50,CrimsonQuill,OOOOH
19-09-2020T15:44:53,Ordithus,this destroys the world
19-09-2020T15:44:53,tehbear,I think Flora would prefer a ham-banner over the ban-hammer
19-09-2020T15:44:54,Roughlandin,Jade is too nice to ban anyone

19-09-2020T15:49:07,tehbear,*enhance*
19-09-2020T15:49:29,Avolendi,You'd think there wouldn't be a problem with taking pictures in the cold... I mean they're basically just frozen images
19-09-2020T15:50:12,tehbear,"chemical reactions require heat to occur, so with old film stock i imagine it would require a longer exposure?"
19-09-2020T15:50:37,Roughlandin,Never snap a snep. Same thing goes for smiles at crocodiles
19-09-2020T15:50:46,Ordithus,it's more the film backing gets stiff and a bit fragile if it gets cold
19-09-2020T15:51:11,ThingsAreMoving,"Not an expert on chemical films, but I think the layer of chemicals reacts to light, not heat per se"
19-09-2020T15:51:19,Avolendi,... I was really hoping my puns would stand more in their own right -.-
19-09-2020T15:51:47,Ordithus,I chose to ignore the pun :cw0lfmare-Disappoint:

19-09-2020T15:52:19,MarkovPolo,I'm absolutely voting for this sketch being colored btw
19-09-2020T15:52:24,MarkovPolo,It's cute af
19-09-2020T15:52:38,Roughlandin,Isn't it... kinda already colored?

19-09-2020T18:35:32,MarkovPolo,I pushed real fucking hard to get a bit of extra speed and my knee made a noise not dissimilar to that of rice krispies
19-09-2020T18:35:41,microbuss,its always that muscle on the back of the lower legs where the cramp happens grrrr
19-09-2020T18:35:48,ThingsAreMoving,you need more magnesium and potassium to minimize cramps
19-09-2020T18:35:55,KeefMcDerpface,Noted
19-09-2020T18:35:56,MarkovPolo,the next day it turned purple and hurt to walk on but it got better after a few weeks so?

19-09-2020T19:15:25,ThingsAreMoving,Also they give out that 'flower children' vibe
19-09-2020T19:16:03,Ordithus,Maddie has a running theme http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/942/

19-09-2020T19:16:17,NezumiYuki,"compared to Eastern Basitin sensabilities, West Basitins are utterly shamefully LEWD. Which probably goes to explain why Keith's old man hid the fact that the Missus was Western."
19-09-2020T19:16:38,unsteddyphoenix,man the way tom censored sarahs nipple is truly impressive

19-09-2020T19:17:28,ThingsAreMoving,Random pebble of obfuscation
19-09-2020T19:17:32,Ordithus,sarah censored herself here http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/898/

19-09-2020T19:18:54,AspiringNoodle,Right? xD
19-09-2020T19:20:27,BADBackgroundProductions,"My assumption was that even if the rock wasn‚Äôt there there wouldn‚Äôt be a nipple anyway because, looking at shirtless male humans in two kinds you can see that they have no nipples"
19-09-2020T19:22:13,NezumiYuki,It would have been hilarious if little Miss Dragon follower?  Had a convenient dragon scale over her nipple.
