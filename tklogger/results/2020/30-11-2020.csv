30-11-2020T20:19:57,Roughlandin,Drugs can do a lot of things. Drug interactions can do even more. Checking that everything was correct and there were no drug interactions was what took most of the time in filling a script back when I worked in the pharmacy
30-11-2020T20:21:21,SpazztasticKiwi,homeboy at work actin sus
30-11-2020T20:21:53,SpazztasticKiwi,and I ask because it‚Äôs either that or my other suspicions
30-11-2020T20:22:59,Roughlandin,"Could be. I wouldn't be able to tell unless I had a full write up of everything he's taking, prescription and otherwise. Though I really can't comment anyway since I don't have a license anymore lol"
30-11-2020T20:27:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I also need to ask dadro something
30-11-2020T20:28:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I suspect these family members that ‚Äútested positive‚Äù are faking for the paid leave
30-11-2020T20:29:26,Roughlandin,Hmm. I dunno. I would think they'd have to show their results to get the leave. But I'm not sure. I don't know how you'd be able to tell because of HIPAA

30-11-2020T20:29:47,Roughlandin,lol
30-11-2020T20:30:14,SpazztasticKiwi,they‚Äôre posting but suspiciously not posting pictures of the sick relatives so far
30-11-2020T20:31:39,Roughlandin,There isn't a crisis on earth people won't take advantage of for personal gain
30-11-2020T20:34:10,SpazztasticKiwi,"there has to be a requirement you prove the positive test for leave, but who‚Äôs to say there‚Äôs not a way to fake it, unless they‚Äôre asymptotic or mild cases"

30-11-2020T20:35:50,SpazztasticKiwi,holyfuck I found a loophole
30-11-2020T20:35:59,Roughlandin,The rabbit hole deepens!
30-11-2020T20:36:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm going to the office when I go in tomorrow
30-11-2020T20:36:39,SpazztasticKiwi,employees have to take a survey and temperature reading before going into work EVERY DAY
30-11-2020T20:37:12,SpazztasticKiwi,one question is the effect of ‚Äúhave you been around someone who has tested positive in the last 14 days‚Äù
30-11-2020T20:38:00,SpazztasticKiwi,"he went to see those relatives on thanksgiving and yet is still coming to work and answering no to that question, if he‚Äôs even doing the survey like he‚Äôs supposed to"
30-11-2020T20:39:29,SpazztasticKiwi,"I don‚Äôt know how head management doesn‚Äôt know this or why they haven‚Äôt responded to it though, because he openly admitted to this visit after the fact and one of these positive relatives works at the same store!"
30-11-2020T20:39:53,Dadrobit,"My site has the rule that if you have a fever or a cough, you MUST stay home and you cannot return until you are tested. Guards are tested for temperatures before they even clock in."
30-11-2020T20:40:27,SpazztasticKiwi,"but if he‚Äôs not getting checked, there‚Äôs no way of knowing"
30-11-2020T20:40:36,SpazztasticKiwi,"plus, what if they‚Äôre not really sick"
30-11-2020T20:41:16,Roughlandin,"Wouldn't be unless he started showing symptoms. Again, HIPAA"
30-11-2020T20:41:28,Dadrobit,"Sick leave ain't permanant. Paychecks stop pretty quick. Either you return, or you get replaced."
30-11-2020T20:42:22,SpazztasticKiwi,"my point is forget the possible fraud, if they are sick, he shouldn‚Äôt be at work because he willingly spent time around them when it‚Äôs an at risk move"
30-11-2020T20:42:31,CrRAR,"Yeah if symptoms become evident, like equivalent ones usually the etiquette is stay home 14 days or suck it up and get a test."
30-11-2020T20:42:38,SpazztasticKiwi,and a move that can get you turned away at the employee entrance and sent home
30-11-2020T20:43:24,Dadrobit,"Oh, so are you saying you know someone was exposed but they aren't quarantining?"
30-11-2020T20:43:37,SpazztasticKiwi,YES
30-11-2020T20:43:43,CrRAR,^
30-11-2020T20:43:45,Dadrobit,Stay the fuck away and wear a mask.
30-11-2020T20:43:54,SpazztasticKiwi,THEY WORK IN MY DEPARTMENT
30-11-2020T20:44:08,Roughlandin,I'd take it to your manager

30-11-2020T20:44:40,Dadrobit,People are shitty. I just outright call them assholes to their face. Makes em keep their distance.
30-11-2020T20:45:19,SpazztasticKiwi,"he got tested the same time as the rest of the family group - about 3, those he doesn‚Äôt live with but are in contact with because they‚Äôre related and babysit his baby"
30-11-2020T20:45:23,Dadrobit,Had to do that with a guard who was filling in for one of my normal crew. Called him an asshole fuck head and he didn't visit me the whole night.
30-11-2020T20:45:28,SpazztasticKiwi,tested positive
30-11-2020T20:45:44,CrRAR,such an inconsiderate derpscicle
30-11-2020T20:45:51,SpazztasticKiwi,but he and the baby - if they even tested the baby - and the fianc√©/wife/mother were negative
30-11-2020T20:46:06,SpazztasticKiwi,yet he went to see them knowingly at thanksgiving
30-11-2020T20:46:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I knew something was wrong

30-11-2020T20:56:55,SpazztasticKiwi,aside from a zombie outbreak
30-11-2020T20:57:27,Roughlandin,This was probably around the time they thought mounting a nuclear grenade launcher to the back of a jeep was a good idea
30-11-2020T20:57:27,SpazztasticKiwi,which notably hasn‚Äôt happened so how it got invented is questionable
30-11-2020T20:57:59,CrRAR,Here's the wiki:

30-11-2020T20:59:31,SpazztasticKiwi,is it against hippa still if you‚Äôre revealing the test results for a covid test of a relative you work with to that workplace
30-11-2020T21:00:06,CrRAR,Patriotism = beeeg deleteriously radioactive explosions
30-11-2020T21:00:55,Roughlandin,HIPAA doesn't apply to individuals. It might be against the law for them to use that information you're giving them to make a decision about that employee
30-11-2020T21:01:22,SpazztasticKiwi,oh right
30-11-2020T21:01:38,SpazztasticKiwi,yeah this guy might be fired
30-11-2020T21:01:46,CrRAR,"Well, if it's public knowledge"
30-11-2020T21:01:57,Dadrobit,"Yes, business associates are not not allowed to disclose known medical information to others without consent. However, there are clauses for ""preventing or lessening a serious threat to health or safety"""
30-11-2020T21:02:04,CrRAR,HIPAA protects protected knowledge
30-11-2020T21:03:19,SpazztasticKiwi,all I‚Äôm saying is he might be in trouble for not doing his survey or lying on it if he is actually doing it and knowingly lying about not being in contact with someone that‚Äôs tested positive

30-11-2020T21:06:44,Roughlandin,Well I did just find an article in National Law Review that says that in certain cases individuals CAN be prosecuted under HIPAA
30-11-2020T21:07:32,Roughlandin,But I don't know if this applies since you're not actually handing over medical documentation
30-11-2020T21:07:41,Dadrobit,"Yes, just because someone confides personal information with you, does not make that public information."
30-11-2020T21:08:13,CrRAR,"Yeah, if you leak secured info I thought though being a trusted keeper of that data?"
30-11-2020T21:08:51,CrRAR,"Trusted keeper being any one privileged to SEE that data, or hear it"

30-11-2020T21:10:33,CrRAR,this job stuff is complicated
30-11-2020T21:10:43,Roughlandin,There's also the possibility he could try to sue you for civil damages if you cost him his job
30-11-2020T21:11:08,SpazztasticKiwi,the guy has told everyone in our department he was over there
30-11-2020T21:11:21,SpazztasticKiwi,or he told everybody that was present the day after
30-11-2020T21:11:28,SpazztasticKiwi,I learned this later
30-11-2020T21:12:09,SpazztasticKiwi,"but he admitted yes they‚Äôre positive, yes he knows, yes they‚Äôre still symptomatic, but yet he‚Äôs still coming back to work"
30-11-2020T21:12:28,CrRAR,arrrghhh
30-11-2020T21:13:22,SpazztasticKiwi,he‚Äôs already been in enough trouble calling in
30-11-2020T21:13:42,CrRAR,Maybe you could subtle suggest you are uncomfortable being on shift with him and his wanton viral harboring behaviors?
30-11-2020T21:13:49,SpazztasticKiwi,"technically, he has enough marks against him already to be fired"
30-11-2020T21:14:24,CrRAR,I feel like that concern is enough to gently put it in manager's hands to act?
30-11-2020T21:14:25,SpazztasticKiwi,"and again, this is something he commented freely"
30-11-2020T21:15:00,SpazztasticKiwi,he‚Äôs digging his own hole with just his mouth
30-11-2020T21:15:09,Roughlandin,A person can reveal their own health information to whomever they want. Beyond that is where HIPAA applies
30-11-2020T21:15:20,CrRAR,yeah
30-11-2020T21:15:59,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm not paid enough for this

30-11-2020T21:16:38,CrRAR,"That's why a patient can circumvent HIPAA just by saying to a doctor ""so and so can know my stuff"""
30-11-2020T21:16:43,Roughlandin,Do not take any of this as legal advice
30-11-2020T21:16:59,Dadrobit,Nope. I have a year of copyright law and a week of HIPPA training. That's about it lol.
30-11-2020T21:17:30,SpazztasticKiwi,all I know is I‚Äôm definitely mentioning the discrepancy between the survey and his coming to work anyway dispite the visit
30-11-2020T21:17:38,SpazztasticKiwi,despite
30-11-2020T21:17:43,SpazztasticKiwi,now I can‚Äôt even spell
30-11-2020T21:17:52,CrRAR,"I would at most just suggest to your managers that you feel uncomfortable being on shift with him for so and so reason, if it's REALLY bugging you."
30-11-2020T21:18:01,Roughlandin,And it's been a couple years since my last HIPAA recertification. And I only had to worry about HIPAA from the point of a care provider
30-11-2020T21:18:25,Roughlandin,I didn't really need to know how it applied to individuals outside the medical field
30-11-2020T21:20:06,CrRAR,all sounds reasonable
30-11-2020T21:22:53,Roughlandin,My biggest run-in with HIPAA was one time when a nosy mother came in demanding to know if her daughter was on birth control. She made every kind of threat in the book
30-11-2020T21:23:13,SpazztasticKiwi,today wasn‚Äôt supposed to be so complicated

30-11-2020T21:24:18,SpazztasticKiwi,even after 18 she was trying to work her way in the doors for all kinds of dr visits with me
30-11-2020T21:25:12,SpazztasticKiwi,she had an absolute FIT one time when this one dr told said ‚Äújust her‚Äù when he called me back
30-11-2020T21:25:21,Roughlandin,I think that exact scenario is the first thing they go over in HIPAA training
30-11-2020T21:25:28,CrRAR,yep
30-11-2020T21:25:57,CrRAR,sharing is not always caring

30-11-2020T21:30:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôll add that this was a visit after that specific relationship & I was 19

30-11-2020T21:33:32,Roughlandin,"Which is exactly what we told Momma Karen. Thank god my pharmacist in charge that day was a lady who took no shit. She told straight up told her if she had a problem, her lawyers could talk to our lawyers and we'd see who flinched first"
30-11-2020T21:33:51,CrRAR,"""what makes you happy, makes me happy"" and such"
30-11-2020T21:35:23,Dadrobit,And birth control medication isn't always JUST for birth control. Also helps control bad/irregular menstrual issues that a person might otherwise suffer from.
30-11-2020T21:35:43,SpazztasticKiwi,and endometriosis
30-11-2020T21:35:43,Roughlandin,They should really stop calling it birth control
30-11-2020T21:35:51,SpazztasticKiwi,and hormone imbalance
30-11-2020T21:35:59,SpazztasticKiwi,and thyroid problems
30-11-2020T21:36:09,SpazztasticKiwi,which is often hormone imbalance
30-11-2020T21:36:28,Dadrobit,"Also, fuck this communications class I'm in. The professor hasn't graded anything in three weeks, she's a viscous grader when she does, and the rest of the class seems to have given up on it."
30-11-2020T21:36:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I know her problem is is literally that she can‚Äôt control me anymore
30-11-2020T21:37:15,Dadrobit,We're required to make 4 replies to other students posts on a topic. Only 3 other people have even made posts even with an extra half week to make them.
30-11-2020T21:37:15,SpazztasticKiwi,we used to be ‚Äúclose‚Äù because I was young and did things close to home or around if not with or according to her/her direction
30-11-2020T21:37:34,Dadrobit,No one else has even bothered to make a reply post besides myself either.
30-11-2020T21:37:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I started dating - my sister never has
30-11-2020T21:38:21,Roughlandin,"Like Will Smith said, ""Parents just don't understand."""

30-11-2020T21:39:03,Roughlandin,Sounds like you and me are the only ones who put any effort into them
30-11-2020T21:39:33,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm not homophobic....and she doesn‚Äôt like that I‚Äôm accepting of that and a good deal of the various walks of life
30-11-2020T21:39:52,Dadrobit,Used to be a full class of 30.
30-11-2020T21:39:55,SpazztasticKiwi,~accepting of those who are like that
30-11-2020T21:40:01,Roughlandin,She's so intolerant that she can't even accept that you're tolerant lol
30-11-2020T21:41:03,SpazztasticKiwi,I mean she‚Äôs maybe mellowed out on some stuff but she‚Äôs still obnoxiously vocal on plenty
30-11-2020T21:41:42,SpazztasticKiwi,I remember a class at icc I was in that I‚Äôm pretty sure the teacher just skim graded assignments
30-11-2020T21:41:52,Roughlandin,I'm taking a US History course that has been basically 100% writing. Some of my submissions I feel like the professor has been docking points just because she doesn't want to look sus for giving me so many 100s
30-11-2020T21:42:22,SpazztasticKiwi,the instructions were to answer with 6-8 sentences (basically saying write a paragraph) for each discussion question
30-11-2020T21:43:32,Roughlandin,"Not to toot my own horn, but I'm a huge history buff and I write very well. I'm at the point where I could skip the final and still get like a B+, though. So I'm not going to complain"
30-11-2020T21:44:06,SpazztasticKiwi,there were times I didn‚Äôt get the question and I babbled yet still got flattering grades vs when i put full effort in
30-11-2020T21:44:31,SpazztasticKiwi,for the weekly assignment
30-11-2020T21:45:23,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm pretty sure there was one time I didn‚Äôt try at all on a question I didn‚Äôt get and there was literally no notable difference in my grade
30-11-2020T21:45:50,Roughlandin,Academic writing in most classes is the art of creative bullshitting. I became so good at it because my AP English teacher in high school wouldn't let me bullshit.
30-11-2020T21:46:22,Roughlandin,She honed me into a wickedly sharp paper bullshitting machine
30-11-2020T21:46:26,SpazztasticKiwi,"if you can‚Äôt blow them away with your brilliance, baffle them with your bullshit"
30-11-2020T21:46:28,Dadrobit,"Alright, I'm not getting any more work done for this class before it's due. I gotta head into work now."

30-11-2020T21:47:45,SpazztasticKiwi,and yeah it should be something other than birth control
30-11-2020T21:48:02,Roughlandin,Definitely
30-11-2020T21:48:02,SpazztasticKiwi,"because it doesn‚Äôt control birth, it prevents it"
30-11-2020T21:48:07,SpazztasticKiwi,if you do it right
30-11-2020T21:48:36,Roughlandin,That's what I had to explain to more than a few angry pregnant women
30-11-2020T21:48:49,SpazztasticKiwi,"in hs a guy commented that if his gf took her pill after she‚Äôd skipped and they‚Äôd done the deed, she wouldn‚Äôt get pregnant"
30-11-2020T21:48:57,SpazztasticKiwi,I said mmmmmmm no
30-11-2020T21:49:09,SpazztasticKiwi,and he‚Äôs like ‚Äúhow do you know‚Äù
30-11-2020T21:49:15,SpazztasticKiwi,I just looked at him
30-11-2020T21:49:37,Roughlandin,I think he was thinking of the morning after pill. Not the same thing
