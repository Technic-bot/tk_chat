26-03-2020T20:17:20,SageSaga,well circumstances changed and Fluff isnt really in a position to draw Mihari much anymore- nice way of saying it i think XD
26-03-2020T20:17:30,Mihari,LOL
26-03-2020T20:17:34,Mihari,About as nice as one can say it.
26-03-2020T20:17:37,BadFoMo,"So, are Twokinds or Nekonny up yet?"

26-03-2020T20:18:29,SageSaga,we're still friends with Fluff though :P so its nothing like that
26-03-2020T20:18:34,Nekonny,"huh, might have to restart"
26-03-2020T20:18:41,VixenDefeas,you can hit update

26-03-2020T20:19:13,Roughlandin,"Oof. Well I understand Fluff situation was getting kind of... out of control. I'll leave it at that. Hope everything works out, Mihari"
26-03-2020T20:19:15,Mihari,I have mixed feelings about Saturdays currently XD
26-03-2020T20:19:30,Nekonny,howcome?

26-03-2020T20:19:35,Mihari,I don't like it in hell.
26-03-2020T20:19:42,BlackjackSec99,Ive the distinct feeling im missing a whole lot of story here...
26-03-2020T20:19:45,SageSaga,it could be worse!
26-03-2020T20:20:09,IronHorseComics,it could be Monday

26-03-2020T20:22:37,Mihari,Catfolk and Tabaxi are VERY different.
26-03-2020T20:22:51,Roughlandin,Now it's starting to sound like a furry version of Doom
26-03-2020T20:22:53,SageSaga,i loved that as soon as you left they started  making deals with devils
26-03-2020T20:23:02,Roughlandin,As one does...
26-03-2020T20:23:10,Mihari,Didn't surprise me in the slightest.
26-03-2020T20:23:32,Mihari,Their alignment is asshole after all.
26-03-2020T20:23:42,Mihari,I mean chaotic neutral

26-03-2020T20:48:50,Roughlandin,And all I'll say for RoS is I liked it better than Last Jedi
26-03-2020T20:49:48,Nekonny,I enjoyed some aspects of all 3 movies
26-03-2020T20:49:50,BlackjackSec99,"lol thats fine, I cant really even formulate how to say how I feel about it well enough to debate. It wasent bad, I enjoyed it, but, I dunno... anyway!"

26-03-2020T20:52:18,Nekonny,Mandalorian has been fun so far
26-03-2020T20:52:28,Nekonny,just not sure where they are going with it
26-03-2020T20:52:30,BlackjackSec99,"probably very soon, they released a fair few soon because of the whole stay home thing"
26-03-2020T20:52:54,Nekonny,there seemed to be a lack of an overall objective
26-03-2020T20:53:01,Mihari,"I have mixed feels about season two. Wish they had casted the VA that did Asohka for her, but the new gal doesn't look bad."

26-03-2020T20:53:45,Mihari,It's just everyone is buzzing about the casting.
26-03-2020T20:53:47,Rosscoe,"Its like how 1st half of season 1 we see our great Mando do bounty hunter stuff, then story takes a change and feels lost"
26-03-2020T20:54:11,Nekonny,I did start watching firefly
26-03-2020T20:54:17,SpazztasticKiwi,if I could just levitate home
26-03-2020T20:54:17,MarvTheHugPharaoh,YES
26-03-2020T20:54:20,Nekonny,pretty good start
26-03-2020T20:54:25,Roughlandin,1st seasons always have to spend a lot of time on establishing work. Witcher had the same problem
26-03-2020T20:54:27,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Firefly is great
26-03-2020T20:54:29,CrRAR,"are you sleepy, spazz?"

26-03-2020T20:55:05,BlackjackSec99,1 season
26-03-2020T20:55:08,Sclimshady,It was aired out of order
26-03-2020T20:55:09,Roughlandin,Really?
26-03-2020T20:55:09,BlackjackSec99,ONE
26-03-2020T20:55:12,Mihari,Not finishing a show because it was canceled is just silly.
26-03-2020T20:55:13,Roughlandin,Oof
26-03-2020T20:55:18,Sclimshady,So the ratings were bad
26-03-2020T20:55:19,Roughlandin,Poor Nathan Fillion
26-03-2020T20:55:20,CrRAR,movie of questionable quality
26-03-2020T20:55:34,Rosscoe,"Charts showed low numbers, show got the axe, wasnt a time for a space western :("

26-03-2020T20:55:51,BlackjackSec99,its a cult classic tho.... like rocky horror picture show
26-03-2020T20:56:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"now, I just got done and it’s an hour past when I was due to leave"
26-03-2020T20:56:36,CrRAR,wow
26-03-2020T20:56:36,Roughlandin,I'm amazing Joss Whedon was able to do ANYTHING that wasn't an instant hit...
26-03-2020T20:56:45,MarvTheHugPharaoh,After you finish the show and the movie.  You will find yourself quoting it in everyday life.
26-03-2020T20:56:45,SageSaga,Firefly got hit by all sorts of bad bull crap- one the network kept changing what day- it didnt get any press
26-03-2020T20:57:03,tehbear,3 hrs of sleep kiwi?
26-03-2020T20:57:03,CrRAR,These work conditions ain't gonna be sustainable.
26-03-2020T20:57:03,Roughlandin,It was on SciFi right? That probably didn't help
26-03-2020T20:57:10,SageSaga,no
26-03-2020T20:57:13,SageSaga,it was on Fox
26-03-2020T20:57:17,CrRAR,ah
26-03-2020T20:57:20,Roughlandin,Oh. Well yeah they do that too
26-03-2020T20:57:23,ZRO4825,Potentially worse!
26-03-2020T20:57:27,CrRAR,classic for killing stuff off
26-03-2020T20:57:31,SpazztasticKiwi,"oh and I got work tomorrow, same thing"
26-03-2020T20:57:33,SageSaga,then Scifi picked it up and it got even more popular because- Scifi people watched Scifi back then
26-03-2020T20:57:38,BlackjackSec99,"yeah, i didnt hear about it untill like 3 years after it got the axe, and its  a genra im interested in"
26-03-2020T20:57:54,BlackjackSec99,genera*
26-03-2020T20:57:59,Roughlandin,Yeah I was about to say. When it came out Scifi was actually pretty popular as a channel
26-03-2020T20:58:13,SpazztasticKiwi,"since it looks like Tom’s gonna be late, I’m most likely skipping the stream"
26-03-2020T20:58:19,BlackjackSec99,awwwwww
