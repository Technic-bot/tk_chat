17-05-2020T00:04:42,AspiringNoodle,"I kinda want to watch his utter annihilation of The Emoji Movie, but tbh I'm sad he didn't just make a 20 second video saying ""THIS MOVIE IS SIN PERSONIFIED"" and giving it infinite sins"

17-05-2020T15:52:40,CrimsonQuill,Evenin all
17-05-2020T15:52:45,CrimsonQuill,Tried Gundyr again last night
17-05-2020T15:52:56,CrimsonQuill,Realised that blocking completely stops his damage
17-05-2020T15:52:58,CrimsonQuill,Still died
17-05-2020T15:53:07,CrimsonQuill,Imma gonna die a lot but it's slow progress
17-05-2020T15:53:15,CrimsonQuill,That's the way of Dark souls I guess
17-05-2020T15:53:28,CrimsonQuill,H2A today
17-05-2020T15:53:48,CrimsonQuill,And I made pancakes and crumble!

17-05-2020T16:02:14,AspiringNoodle,Try rolling :)
17-05-2020T16:02:21,CrimsonQuill,XD
17-05-2020T16:02:24,CrimsonQuill,I did XD
17-05-2020T16:02:37,AspiringNoodle,You gotta do it  just before the attack lands
17-05-2020T16:03:04,AspiringNoodle,"With most attacks in the game, if you roll as the wind-up ends, you won't take damage"
17-05-2020T16:04:26,AspiringNoodle,"Also, bosses typically have a pretty lengthy cooldown after an attack finishes.  Enough for 3 or so swings of a straight sword"
17-05-2020T16:04:45,CrimsonQuill,I see
17-05-2020T16:04:51,CrimsonQuill,I figured out how to swap weaposns
17-05-2020T16:04:54,CrimsonQuill,BRB Halo match
17-05-2020T16:07:36,JojoGD,Hi quill

17-05-2020T16:14:53,AspiringNoodle,I think I'm going to start doing bosses by myself

17-05-2020T17:11:24,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-excited:
17-05-2020T17:11:39,AspiringNoodle,Just used one of the combs for my trimmer to trim some hair on my forehead
17-05-2020T17:11:40,CrimsonQuill,Hiya Noodle
17-05-2020T17:11:44,CrimsonQuill,O Neat!
17-05-2020T17:11:56,AspiringNoodle,"I was able to make it shorter AND look natural, despite not being a certified beautician!"
17-05-2020T17:12:08,AspiringNoodle,"My hair's annoying, lol"
17-05-2020T17:12:11,CrimsonQuill,"Oh, nice work!"
17-05-2020T17:12:21,AspiringNoodle,The reason I normally keep it short is because it curls forward on its own
17-05-2020T17:12:28,AspiringNoodle,And it got to the point where it was poking me in the forehead
17-05-2020T17:12:30,CrimsonQuill,"When I tried cutting my own hair, I needed a friend to help shave me bald after I effed up"
17-05-2020T17:12:34,AspiringNoodle,Was just annoying :P
17-05-2020T17:12:54,AspiringNoodle,"Once I let it charge, I'll try getting other spots that are bugging me"
17-05-2020T17:13:04,AspiringNoodle,That alone should make the wait for things to open up more bearable
17-05-2020T17:13:26,CrimsonQuill,Nice
17-05-2020T17:13:42,CrimsonQuill,My hair is slowly growing back after my cockup
17-05-2020T17:13:53,AspiringNoodle,I had a customer just go full bald
17-05-2020T17:13:56,CrimsonQuill,It's like a soft brush at present
17-05-2020T17:14:04,CrimsonQuill,It isn't very comfy tbh
17-05-2020T17:14:10,AspiringNoodle,He was annoyed at how long his hair was getting and how uncomfortable it was
17-05-2020T17:14:13,CrimsonQuill,Until the hair comes back the head is cold
17-05-2020T17:14:18,AspiringNoodle,"So he just trimmed everything off, sans beard"
17-05-2020T17:14:27,CrimsonQuill,"From now on, the shortest I'll ever go is buzzcut"
17-05-2020T17:14:36,AspiringNoodle,"Honestly, I was just one step above that!"
17-05-2020T17:14:38,CrimsonQuill,"But really, I want my troublesom fringe back"
17-05-2020T17:14:45,CrimsonQuill,XD
17-05-2020T17:14:54,AspiringNoodle,I might try having long hair for once
17-05-2020T17:14:55,CrimsonQuill,I'll beat Gundyr Eventually
17-05-2020T17:14:59,CrimsonQuill,With my HAIR
17-05-2020T17:15:06,AspiringNoodle,But it'll depend on what the stylist says it will entail
17-05-2020T17:15:11,CrimsonQuill,My FACE is my SHIELD
17-05-2020T17:15:18,CrimsonQuill,My HAIR is my SWORD
17-05-2020T17:15:25,AspiringNoodle,"Because if the sides / back are short, and the top is longer, then I could deal with that :D"
17-05-2020T17:16:41,AspiringNoodle,Seriously though
17-05-2020T17:16:43,CrimsonQuill,I like even all around
17-05-2020T17:16:54,AspiringNoodle,Just that small trim has made my length sooooooo much more bearable
17-05-2020T17:17:59,CrimsonQuill,Nice
17-05-2020T17:18:55,AspiringNoodle,"Well, I'm not joking"
17-05-2020T17:18:59,AspiringNoodle,My hair is poking me in places
17-05-2020T17:19:03,AspiringNoodle,I'm poking myself
17-05-2020T17:19:12,AspiringNoodle,I MUST STOP THE POKING OF MYSELF BY MYSELF
17-05-2020T17:19:22,CrimsonQuill,"Well, short hair makes it easier for me to wear my kitchen hat"
17-05-2020T17:19:24,CrimsonQuill,Hair hat
17-05-2020T17:19:48,CrimsonQuill,But I look forward to a nice crop o' hair again
17-05-2020T17:22:23,AspiringNoodle,"I curse that I need to charge my trimmer right now, lol"
17-05-2020T17:22:26,AspiringNoodle,I want to keep going
17-05-2020T17:22:31,AspiringNoodle,Shorten all the hair!
17-05-2020T17:22:40,AspiringNoodle,"...okay, just some of the hair.  Particularly the hair that's annoying me"

17-05-2020T17:26:13,CrimsonQuill,Rhubarb and blackberry crumble and a lotta pancakes today
17-05-2020T17:31:56,CrimsonQuill,"The crumble was shallow though-I didn't realise how big the glass tray was, or how much topping I'd need, or how little space the ingredients'd take up when stewed! XD"
17-05-2020T17:32:07,CrimsonQuill,It tasted like home though...like mummy made it...
