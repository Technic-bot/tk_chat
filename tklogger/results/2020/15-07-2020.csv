15-07-2020T01:17:26,AspiringNoodle,It's sad how many people are still picking up smoking
15-07-2020T01:17:42,AspiringNoodle,"It's like, you do realize how horrible that stuff is to your body, as well as how much it's gonna cost, right???"

15-07-2020T02:04:25,SpazztasticKiwi,is it not against the rules to smoke in a closed room
15-07-2020T02:17:11,Dadrobit,The stench was/is in his clothes.
15-07-2020T02:17:49,Dadrobit,"Bonus points for the cheap cologne he uses to try and bathe in to cover it up, so it smells EXTRA terrible."
15-07-2020T02:51:46,AspiringNoodle,"Huh, would you look at that..."
15-07-2020T02:51:57,AspiringNoodle,Requiring all people to wear a mask would actually violate the ADA...
15-07-2020T02:52:29,AspiringNoodle,"Ugh, we're screwed no matter what"
15-07-2020T02:52:43,AspiringNoodle,People are gonna say whatever they want so they don't have to wear a mask...

15-07-2020T11:40:07,Dadrobit,Amaretto Irish Coffee
15-07-2020T11:40:39,CrRAR,"No irish cream though that’s probably a good idea, I think I have some"
15-07-2020T11:40:50,CrRAR,Could fancy it up with whipped cream
15-07-2020T11:41:00,Dadrobit,Amaretto is Italian yeah?
15-07-2020T11:41:07,CrRAR,Yeah
15-07-2020T11:41:09,Dadrobit,So... Like an Italian Coffee
15-07-2020T11:41:13,CrRAR,It’s almondy
15-07-2020T11:41:33,CrRAR,Though apparently it’s made with peach pits or something
15-07-2020T11:41:40,Dadrobit,Raw almondy or toasted?
15-07-2020T11:41:49,CrRAR,So like cherry-almondy tasting
15-07-2020T11:41:56,CrRAR,I guess toasted
15-07-2020T11:42:02,CrRAR,"Raw, ew lol"
15-07-2020T11:42:11,Dadrobit,My man
15-07-2020T11:42:39,Dadrobit,Can't say I've ever had an amaretto drink.
15-07-2020T11:42:50,CrRAR,"Kinda a little like a macaroon, which actually makes sense if it had coconut in it somehow"
15-07-2020T11:43:14,Dadrobit,Macaroons are amazeballs. I'm sold.
15-07-2020T11:43:29,CrRAR,"It tastes a bit like a more bitter almond exract, which makes sense for a liquer."
15-07-2020T11:43:41,CrRAR,yeah
15-07-2020T11:49:29,Dadrobit,Watching some SC2 content. Makes me almost want to start playing again....

15-07-2020T15:41:49,SpazztasticKiwi,here’s a totally unrelated but random question
15-07-2020T15:42:20,SpazztasticKiwi,how do you separate a mirror from the wood frame it’s stapled & screwed in
15-07-2020T15:42:27,SpazztasticKiwi,without breaking it
15-07-2020T15:55:00,SpazztasticKiwi,nm I did the thing

15-07-2020T16:34:56,SpazztasticKiwi,online streaming service has frozen 2
15-07-2020T16:35:15,SpazztasticKiwi,right below it is a recommended selection
15-07-2020T16:35:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"for a horror movie, Frozen"
15-07-2020T16:35:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"watch your kids online, folks"
15-07-2020T16:36:26,CrRAR,wow
15-07-2020T16:36:38,CrRAR,Frozen 2 was... interesting
15-07-2020T16:37:14,CrRAR,"I feel as though they took a VERY generic script and slapped some Frozen songs on it, called it a day"
15-07-2020T16:38:22,CrRAR,I probably have some more specific gripes but it was so unremarkable I’ve completely forgot any details xD
15-07-2020T16:51:37,SpazztasticKiwi,I know they wanted another movie & explain elsas powers but the movie had spots that could’ve been deleted or changed
15-07-2020T16:51:49,SpazztasticKiwi,& I’m convinced kristoffs part was filler
15-07-2020T16:53:34,Xexanoth,so mostly it was further proof that Disney can't do sequels
15-07-2020T16:54:06,Xexanoth,(with the exception of the Fairy movies where the first on sucked and the rest was good)
15-07-2020T17:13:05,AspiringNoodle,"Yeah, the sequel was entertaining, but there were superfluous parts that ultimately weren't relevant to the plot"
15-07-2020T17:14:16,AspiringNoodle,"They literally could've just clued us in that Kristoff was going off with the reindeer guy to get love advice, have him come back later in the film for support, and still have him propose / confess, and it wouldn't have made much difference"
15-07-2020T17:15:00,AspiringNoodle,"That said, him accidentally proposing to the tribe elder was hilarious, change my mind :ptv-snicker:"
15-07-2020T17:36:05,CrRAR,"I think overall it was that the movie was more of a downer, very somber mood"
15-07-2020T17:36:16,CrRAR,Now that I’m thinking about it
15-07-2020T17:36:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I did the reset for my laptop & it didn’t do anything
15-07-2020T17:36:38,CrRAR,Oh yeah that’s right the whole Kistoff proposal drama
15-07-2020T17:38:14,CrRAR,Yeah just very kistchy altogether

15-07-2020T17:41:16,CrRAR,Is that the battery not charging?
15-07-2020T17:42:31,SpazztasticKiwi,it won’t play anything
15-07-2020T17:42:39,SpazztasticKiwi,or connect to internet
15-07-2020T17:42:51,SpazztasticKiwi,and it started not opening settings or word

15-07-2020T17:43:20,CrRAR,Is it ssd or hdd?
15-07-2020T17:43:27,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t know
15-07-2020T17:43:42,CrRAR,Typically the more you try to fix with a failing hdd the more things go wrong
15-07-2020T17:43:46,SpazztasticKiwi,there’s no reason there should be a problem
15-07-2020T17:44:06,AspiringNoodle,That's where ye be wrong

15-07-2020T17:44:33,SpazztasticKiwi,or two
15-07-2020T17:44:39,AspiringNoodle,There are several possibilities why things are going wrong
15-07-2020T17:44:44,CrRAR,Yeah that’s kinda young
15-07-2020T17:44:47,AspiringNoodle,"Might be malware, but I doubt it"
15-07-2020T17:45:14,SpazztasticKiwi,"no shit noodle, the problem is there’s no reason for what’s even wrong"
15-07-2020T17:45:26,AspiringNoodle,:\
15-07-2020T17:45:37,AspiringNoodle,There are two likelier possibilities

15-07-2020T17:45:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"when it froze during updates, I rest it but then it wouldn’t retry the updates"

15-07-2020T17:46:07,SpazztasticKiwi,restarted
15-07-2020T17:46:08,AspiringNoodle,You likely have corrupted files in your OS

15-07-2020T17:47:25,CrRAR,Windows don’t activate?
15-07-2020T17:47:33,AspiringNoodle,"By reset, do you mean restart the computer?  Return to factory settings?  Activate windows update again?"

15-07-2020T17:48:59,SpazztasticKiwi,"battery, word, speech recognition, settings for the system, volume & audio wasn’t working but I followed the file changes suggested & that came back"
15-07-2020T17:49:04,CrRAR,"I would run a disk check, start there, there has to be a reason so many functions are just crapping out"
15-07-2020T17:49:23,AspiringNoodle,"Honestly, with that many problems, I stick with my initial diagnoses"
15-07-2020T17:49:25,SpazztasticKiwi,disk check won’t work either that I could manage I checked
15-07-2020T17:49:39,AspiringNoodle,It's likely the OS got corrupted when the update failed
15-07-2020T17:49:43,CrRAR,welp
15-07-2020T17:49:56,CrRAR,Yeah sounds possible noodle
15-07-2020T17:50:10,SpazztasticKiwi,I haven’t tried games but I was aiming to clear those anyway really & keep it as a documents & video laptop

15-07-2020T18:09:47,AspiringNoodle,:O
15-07-2020T18:09:51,AspiringNoodle,Nice
15-07-2020T18:09:57,SpazztasticKiwi,not really
15-07-2020T18:10:06,CrRAR,If you type “cmd” and right click the shortcut that pops up you can pick “run as administrator”
15-07-2020T18:10:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I just never really used it much
15-07-2020T18:10:31,CrRAR,Aka type cmd into the start menu
15-07-2020T18:10:35,SpazztasticKiwi,might watch a movie with it cause it’s got a 15.6 touchscreen or use word
15-07-2020T18:10:52,SpazztasticKiwi,or use it to store videos I want to keep on hand but that’s it
15-07-2020T18:10:54,AspiringNoodle,An easy way to tell that a command prompt is running as an admin is that sys32 will shown
15-07-2020T18:11:04,CrRAR,Yup
15-07-2020T18:11:29,SpazztasticKiwi,but no there’s no command prompt on the list
15-07-2020T18:11:41,AspiringNoodle,Huh...
15-07-2020T18:11:55,CrRAR,Even by typing after hittin the windows key?
15-07-2020T18:11:58,AspiringNoodle,Do you have the search bar on the task bar?
15-07-2020T18:12:07,SpazztasticKiwi,"as for the times I believe I’ve pulled that same tab up, I can’t remember ever seeing it there either"
15-07-2020T18:12:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve always used windows+x
15-07-2020T18:12:46,CrRAR,Ah
15-07-2020T18:12:46,AspiringNoodle,"Oh, perfect!"
15-07-2020T18:12:52,AspiringNoodle,Is there an admin option for command prompt?

15-07-2020T18:13:39,SpazztasticKiwi,still no command prompt
15-07-2020T18:13:56,SpazztasticKiwi,there’s a computer management & disk management
15-07-2020T18:14:02,SpazztasticKiwi,& device manager
15-07-2020T18:14:17,SpazztasticKiwi,don’t let the Karen’s know where all the managers hide

15-07-2020T18:15:26,SpazztasticKiwi,“Windows powershell (admin)”
15-07-2020T18:15:36,SpazztasticKiwi,that’s what that option is for me
15-07-2020T18:15:41,CrRAR,I think you can run dism i powershell
15-07-2020T18:15:45,CrRAR,In
15-07-2020T18:15:57,CrRAR,So that should work
15-07-2020T18:16:05,SpazztasticKiwi,why does powershell sound like something you throw in mario kart
15-07-2020T18:16:14,CrRAR,Haha
15-07-2020T18:16:21,SpazztasticKiwi,well it does!
15-07-2020T18:16:23,AspiringNoodle,Hmmm... I'm gonna go with rar on this
15-07-2020T18:16:28,CrRAR,It do
15-07-2020T18:16:33,AspiringNoodle,"Run that as admin, and try re-entering the DISM command"

15-07-2020T18:17:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"if I’m running this as admin, why are you asking"

15-07-2020T18:25:19,SpazztasticKiwi,look at it
15-07-2020T18:25:25,SpazztasticKiwi,look at it and feel it
15-07-2020T18:25:57,SpazztasticKiwi,this’ll take forever
15-07-2020T18:26:03,AspiringNoodle,LMAO
15-07-2020T18:26:06,AspiringNoodle,That meme is peak
15-07-2020T18:26:16,AspiringNoodle,"Also, DISM might take a while"
15-07-2020T18:26:39,SpazztasticKiwi,"it did nothing for awhile but now it’s loading something at like, the speed of online customer service"
15-07-2020T18:27:02,SpazztasticKiwi,“timer till computer explodes”
15-07-2020T18:27:41,AspiringNoodle,The command I gave you can pull the necessary data it needs from a server
15-07-2020T18:27:56,AspiringNoodle,useful for repairing stuff without needing to plug extra stuff in
15-07-2020T18:28:53,AspiringNoodle,Hopefully this'll confirm what I think is wrong and we can fix it right here and now
15-07-2020T18:29:46,SpazztasticKiwi,I doubt it at this rate
15-07-2020T18:30:31,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve been wanting a game laptop but didn’t look into it much cause I wasn’t sure especially after the discord server I had was thrown out
15-07-2020T18:31:10,SpazztasticKiwi,"& was hoping to kinda move out at the time, if not at some point before I got it so I could have an office space for it"
15-07-2020T18:31:35,AspiringNoodle,Watching Henry Cavill build a computer is something I didn't know I needed
15-07-2020T18:31:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"but i didn’t want it to be like, laptop + game laptop cause that’s really one more than you necessarily need & I hate to waste"
15-07-2020T18:32:39,SpazztasticKiwi,but then I was like “well it still technically wouldn’t be - you could use this one as you are now for videos to keep & pictures & movies & documents so you don’t bog the gaming one down”
15-07-2020T18:32:39,AspiringNoodle,"I dunno, lol"
15-07-2020T18:33:01,AspiringNoodle,I imagine having a workhorse computer would be useful for work stuff / gaming
15-07-2020T18:33:21,AspiringNoodle,And then something like a surface where you have a touch screen would be a nice compliment
15-07-2020T18:33:23,SpazztasticKiwi,but THAT led to “but what if I have the regular one on me somewhere or want to travel & I can’t take to laptops around for whatever reason that’s ridiculous”
15-07-2020T18:33:52,AspiringNoodle,"Like, imagine if you needed to work on an animation while on the road"
15-07-2020T18:34:07,AspiringNoodle,The surface would be STUPIDLY useful to get the hard work done
15-07-2020T18:34:14,AspiringNoodle,Then the workhorse laptop could render all that shiz :D
15-07-2020T18:34:42,AspiringNoodle,We legit have laptops at this point that are just gaming PC's in a mobile form xD
15-07-2020T18:35:10,SpazztasticKiwi,the touchscreen had potion the drawing thing but without it moving like a drawing laptop it’s just useful to being quicker with buttons
15-07-2020T18:35:48,AspiringNoodle,"Lol, this is hilarious! https://twitter.com/i/events/1283813839591534592"
15-07-2020T18:36:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"& the game laptop was only cause if I got it now or had then, I don’t have room for an actual game computer"
15-07-2020T18:36:52,SpazztasticKiwi,"if I managed it when I moved out, a full computer would be more likely"
15-07-2020T18:37:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"cause if I play, it’ll be things I can sit & work with for hours"
15-07-2020T18:38:01,SpazztasticKiwi,which is the most likely now that I do t have a discord connection but with like 2 people than I used to before the server was abandoned
15-07-2020T18:38:16,SpazztasticKiwi,all the others aren’t reachable now
15-07-2020T18:38:37,SpazztasticKiwi,imma go pick up a box while that ticks away
15-07-2020T18:39:43,AspiringNoodle,"Yeah, I don't know if DISM is more affected by processor speed or internet, or both xD"
15-07-2020T18:39:59,SpazztasticKiwi,that laptop doesn’t have internet
15-07-2020T18:40:04,AspiringNoodle,"So my computer might be fast, but it's because it's stupidly powerful hardware, combined with 75 Mbps wifi and I'm right above the router"
15-07-2020T18:40:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"I used hotspots if I ever connected it & half the time, I got to using my own hotspot from my phone"
15-07-2020T18:40:30,SpazztasticKiwi,unlimited data
15-07-2020T18:40:34,AspiringNoodle,Nice
15-07-2020T18:40:44,AspiringNoodle,So it might be the online portion of the DISM that's slowing everything down
15-07-2020T18:40:59,SpazztasticKiwi,yiss nice
15-07-2020T18:41:30,AspiringNoodle,"Btw, I love how genuine Henry's experience was xD"
15-07-2020T18:41:43,AspiringNoodle,"Take literally forever, a silly mistake :P"
15-07-2020T18:42:00,AspiringNoodle,"Even building my new PC, it took me a couple of days because this thing is a whole different beast"
15-07-2020T18:42:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I haven’t watched yet
15-07-2020T18:42:10,AspiringNoodle,Do eeeeet
15-07-2020T18:42:27,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t see unus annus until I get off work or at night when I would be
15-07-2020T18:42:40,AspiringNoodle,"When I built my current PC, it took forever just because of how large this thing was"
15-07-2020T18:42:42,SpazztasticKiwi,"almost right before bed, sometimes after duolingo"
15-07-2020T18:42:56,AspiringNoodle,"I spent a fair amount of time trying to figure out how to work with the cables, because some of them are just a smidge short"
15-07-2020T18:43:17,SpazztasticKiwi,"which - interesting - Spanish may be easier, but two years of it in hs & I’m better at it than my german"
15-07-2020T18:44:12,SpazztasticKiwi,& I’ve had the German fresh with no previous interaction for the past 2ish years
15-07-2020T18:45:03,AspiringNoodle,Interesting
15-07-2020T18:46:27,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s just that Spanish is easier to learn & pick up
15-07-2020T18:46:53,SpazztasticKiwi,"it’s one of the easiest TO learn, actually, or at least it’s CONSIDERED"
