08-08-2020T15:08:25,AspiringNoodle,I preferred it when it was a bi-state area with an adjacent area right over there

08-08-2020T15:33:43,Dadrobit,"Lady is making a habit of calling off on Saturday. She didn't want to call me, so she sent an email to the fucking account manager instead."
08-08-2020T15:33:51,Brocade,covid relief's been pretty inadequate for most people
08-08-2020T15:33:58,AspiringNoodle,Somebody's looking to get fired
08-08-2020T15:34:12,AspiringNoodle,Or get an hours reduction
08-08-2020T15:34:13,Dadrobit,Probably not. She's still got a pulse.
08-08-2020T15:34:33,AspiringNoodle,"Like, I get a body's a body, but if that body isn't present, then is it really a body?"
08-08-2020T15:34:35,Dadrobit,"And hell no, she's not getting hours cut"
08-08-2020T15:34:51,Dadrobit,We don't have the bodies as it is
08-08-2020T15:35:17,CrimsonQuill,My friend says I can apply for Warranty off Amazon if the cable needs replacing
08-08-2020T15:35:24,CrimsonQuill,For my tablet
08-08-2020T15:35:44,CrimsonQuill,"Hours cut should happen to that sort of negligence, Dadrobit"
08-08-2020T15:36:06,CrimsonQuill,But if you don't have the staff...that ios rough
08-08-2020T15:36:06,Dadrobit,"Nope, not happening"
08-08-2020T15:36:39,Dadrobit,"Cutting hours is not in my wheelhouse. I can fire people for shit, but she's not there yet."
08-08-2020T15:36:51,CrimsonQuill,We're sometimes understaffed in the kitchens of the nursing home in which I work. It's terrible those days.
08-08-2020T15:37:28,AspiringNoodle,Know that feeling...
08-08-2020T15:37:45,AspiringNoodle,"We REALLY need 3 people on second shift, at least on fridays, maybe saturdays"
08-08-2020T15:38:09,AspiringNoodle,"But nope, same old bs of 2 people each shift, with one employee (usually me) manning the store solo for 1.5 hours"
08-08-2020T15:38:23,AspiringNoodle,No time for breaks :/
08-08-2020T15:38:30,ThingsAreMoving,"That's normal on gas stations, Noodle"
08-08-2020T15:38:58,Dadrobit,You guys get breaks?
08-08-2020T15:39:02,AspiringNoodle,It's just gonna be fun once things come to a head
08-08-2020T15:39:24,ThingsAreMoving,I get 30 minutes of break time on my 12 hour shifts
08-08-2020T15:39:32,AspiringNoodle,At some point there'll be so much to catch up on that we'll be playing catch-up with catch-up :ptv-laugh:
08-08-2020T15:41:25,CrimsonQuill,Lord help us when that happens
08-08-2020T15:41:40,AspiringNoodle,It's kinda already happening :ptv-snicker:
08-08-2020T15:42:04,ThingsAreMoving,"Meh, worst case scenario you won't have the shelves stocked up"
08-08-2020T15:42:15,AspiringNoodle,"Already there, lol"
08-08-2020T15:42:21,SpazztasticKiwi,🍦
08-08-2020T15:42:31,AspiringNoodle,Nothing like milk / tea being out of stock for 3 hours
08-08-2020T15:42:49,AspiringNoodle,And beer being half-stocked while the back is loaded
08-08-2020T15:43:11,Dadrobit,Is.... Is milk sold in gas stations?
08-08-2020T15:43:14,CrimsonQuill,"When the tea is gone, the apocalypse must commence in earnest"
08-08-2020T15:43:17,AspiringNoodle,It is at mine :D
08-08-2020T15:43:22,ThingsAreMoving,"yep, Dad"
08-08-2020T15:43:27,Dadrobit,shudders
08-08-2020T15:43:28,AspiringNoodle,Our branded milks and teas sell like crazy
08-08-2020T15:43:41,AspiringNoodle,But there's too much to do for just 2 people with as busy as it is
08-08-2020T15:43:41,ThingsAreMoving,gas stations now make more monies from convenience sales than selling gas
08-08-2020T15:43:46,AspiringNoodle,^^
08-08-2020T15:43:56,Dadrobit,"That's how it's always been, Things"
08-08-2020T15:44:06,SpazztasticKiwi,somebody said tea
08-08-2020T15:44:24,Dadrobit,Family friend owned a couple in New York 20 years ago and it was the same story
08-08-2020T15:44:39,ThingsAreMoving,"But now they went bonkers, going as far as selling cut meats and fresh vegetables"
08-08-2020T15:44:45,SpazztasticKiwi,who goes to a gas station to get their milk brand tho
08-08-2020T15:44:54,SpazztasticKiwi,isn’t that asking for food poisoning
08-08-2020T15:45:02,Dadrobit,"Fresh fruits I can see, stuff like bananas and oranges"
08-08-2020T15:45:19,AspiringNoodle,Our convenience store in particular in particular was partnered with a dairy brand
08-08-2020T15:45:19,ThingsAreMoving,"try carrots, potatoes and such"
08-08-2020T15:45:34,AspiringNoodle,"...broken record moment, lol"
08-08-2020T15:45:48,SpazztasticKiwi,so they just sold the milk for them then
08-08-2020T15:45:55,AspiringNoodle,And ice cream
08-08-2020T15:45:56,AspiringNoodle,and tea
08-08-2020T15:45:59,AspiringNoodle,and lemonade
08-08-2020T15:46:01,SpazztasticKiwi,that makes more sense
08-08-2020T15:46:31,AspiringNoodle,"But what's extra stupid is apparently ever since being bought out by the new company, while we retain the old name, we're not under the same umbrella as the dairy division anymore"
08-08-2020T15:46:40,AspiringNoodle,So we're not getting special rates on certain goods
08-08-2020T15:47:17,SpazztasticKiwi,that sounds like a company problem not a you problem
08-08-2020T15:47:19,ThingsAreMoving,Get out of customer service as soon as possible. It's gonna destroy your soul.
08-08-2020T15:47:34,AspiringNoodle,"A prime example is that our all natural ice cream normally sells for $5.99 a tub, but the convenience store chain has long had buy one get one special (usually bogo for a dollar)"
08-08-2020T15:47:47,SpazztasticKiwi,what if I didn’t have a soul
08-08-2020T15:47:58,ThingsAreMoving,Carry on then
08-08-2020T15:48:01,AspiringNoodle,"It swaps between the all natural and regular ice creams, but right now it's 2 for $7 on the all natural"
08-08-2020T15:48:04,Dadrobit,"Yeah, retail is especially bad in customer service. Been there, did that, never again."
08-08-2020T15:48:26,AspiringNoodle,But apparently we're losing $3+ every single time we ring out that special
08-08-2020T15:49:10,AspiringNoodle,"It's a shame, I can honestly say I like our customers"
08-08-2020T15:49:20,SpazztasticKiwi,why I’m not gonna try transferring to a cashier 101
08-08-2020T15:49:32,AspiringNoodle,Few bad apples (usually because something around the store isn't working properly).  But most customers are neutral to downright jolly
08-08-2020T15:49:39,Dadrobit,I am extremely fortunate for my job. Love 98% of my clients.
08-08-2020T15:49:50,Dadrobit,The last 2% just want me to do my job.
08-08-2020T15:49:54,AspiringNoodle,What drives me nuts is the workload...
08-08-2020T15:50:11,Dadrobit,"And, like, one lady that vehemently hates me."
08-08-2020T15:50:28,ThingsAreMoving,"I am glad I went for machine operating. I just set it and watch it do all the work, basically."
08-08-2020T15:50:33,AspiringNoodle,It is extremely frustrating to need to do something on a semi-strict timely manner
08-08-2020T15:50:46,SpazztasticKiwi,had a guy at my first job where I was a cashier that thought it was funny to play the “here’s my card but then take it away when I reach for it”
08-08-2020T15:50:50,AspiringNoodle,And then be locked behind the register near / beyond the deadline
08-08-2020T15:51:00,Dadrobit,"Like, lathe operator, Things?"
08-08-2020T15:51:08,SpazztasticKiwi,"second time he did it, I closed the window & told the front he wasn’t paying"
08-08-2020T15:51:21,AspiringNoodle,RIP
08-08-2020T15:51:23,ThingsAreMoving,Automatic flatbed diecutter operator
08-08-2020T15:51:29,SpazztasticKiwi,he pouted and gave it to me after that
08-08-2020T15:51:42,CrimsonQuill,Wow...I should be glad all i Have to do is wash dishes...
08-08-2020T15:51:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"die mad about it, I’m not paid to play games"
08-08-2020T15:52:02,AspiringNoodle,"Kiwi, I know your pain"
08-08-2020T15:52:24,AspiringNoodle,"I get irritated (internally) when I need to ring out other customers, or need to go take care of something that can't wait"
08-08-2020T15:52:35,AspiringNoodle,And a customer is moving waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too slow
08-08-2020T15:52:37,Dadrobit,Like a an automatic milling machine? Or a like a punch cutter?
08-08-2020T15:53:08,AspiringNoodle,"I had a customer yesterday, an older gentleman, and it took him somewhere around 30 seconds to put his change away and pick up his stuff before leaving the counter"
08-08-2020T15:53:27,AspiringNoodle,"All the while, I'm standing there like an idiot, a customer is standing in line like an idiot"
08-08-2020T15:53:27,InTheLionsDen,He was a fast one.
08-08-2020T15:53:28,SpazztasticKiwi,old people are slow
08-08-2020T15:53:33,ThingsAreMoving,"When I was working on a gas station we had all various nutjobs coming in, one time during night shift a drunkard threw a full vodka bottle at me, good thing I dodged, but the entire shelf with expensive alcohol which was behind me was decimated."
08-08-2020T15:53:35,SpazztasticKiwi,did you miss that memo
08-08-2020T15:53:56,AspiringNoodle,"Huh, I must have the odd ones then"
08-08-2020T15:54:07,AspiringNoodle,Most old people I ring out are regulars and they're pretty energetic
08-08-2020T15:54:44,ThingsAreMoving,on a slow month we averaged 34k customers
08-08-2020T15:54:56,Dadrobit,"Mmmm, I remember my first day of working as a cashier. Lady threw a bag of coffee grinds at me for not being fast enough. Blocked it with my arm, but it exploded and went fucking everywhere"
08-08-2020T15:54:59,AspiringNoodle,how much in sales per shift?
08-08-2020T15:55:01,SpazztasticKiwi,old people have one last place to be and I don’t think any of them are in a hurry to get there
08-08-2020T15:55:12,Dadrobit,Great introduction to the gig
08-08-2020T15:55:13,ThingsAreMoving,"that doesn't translate, Noodle. I'm not from the US."
08-08-2020T15:55:20,AspiringNoodle,awww
08-08-2020T15:55:24,CrimsonQuill,...Some of the old people I see can't walk at all...
08-08-2020T15:55:42,CrimsonQuill,"They're just...lying there. On their beds in their rooms, as I pass by with the trolleys."
08-08-2020T15:56:04,SpazztasticKiwi,I volunteered at a nursing home once
08-08-2020T15:56:07,CrimsonQuill,"Wired into machines, as they fade away. People feeding them at dinner, and helping them to bed."
08-08-2020T15:56:17,CrimsonQuill,I am glad I'm not a nurse.
08-08-2020T15:56:21,CrimsonQuill,I couldn't handle that.
08-08-2020T15:56:39,AspiringNoodle,Gonna be a bit controversial here
08-08-2020T15:56:55,Brocade,hoo boy
08-08-2020T15:56:59,AspiringNoodle,"If I ever get diagnosed with Alzheimers, I will probably opt for euthanasia :|"
08-08-2020T15:57:17,CrimsonQuill,That's what Sir Terry Pratchett advocated before he died of it...
08-08-2020T15:57:29,ThingsAreMoving,does your countr yeven allow euthanasia?
08-08-2020T15:57:41,AspiringNoodle,Lost 1 grandparent to it.  Another has it pretty bad.
08-08-2020T15:57:46,CrimsonQuill,I don't know about mine.
08-08-2020T15:57:47,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,Euthanasia sounds alot like your saying youth in asia...
08-08-2020T15:57:56,AspiringNoodle,HA
08-08-2020T15:58:15,SpazztasticKiwi,this comment was brought to us by left field

08-08-2020T15:58:25,CrimsonQuill,"My grandfather on my mother's side got dementia. He often couldn't remember us, or our mother and aunt..."
08-08-2020T15:58:32,ThingsAreMoving,"Sorry for your tough experiences, Noodle. But before you get old they might have solutions for it in place tbh"
08-08-2020T15:58:52,CrimsonQuill,We had a nurse to help him after Nana died.
08-08-2020T15:59:01,CrimsonQuill,He had seven cups of tea a day.
08-08-2020T15:59:06,CrimsonQuill,Stubborn to the end.
08-08-2020T15:59:13,ThingsAreMoving,"hell, next week Elon Musk's NeuraLink supposedly gonna show an upload of music straight into the brain"
08-08-2020T15:59:31,CrimsonQuill,"@ThingsAreMoving I'm sorry, COME AGAIN?"
08-08-2020T15:59:39,ThingsAreMoving,or was it end of august... :ctwokinds-floraquestion:

08-08-2020T16:00:24,CrimsonQuill,But...but...who wants to live forever?
08-08-2020T16:00:29,CrimsonQuill,It'd be horrible!
08-08-2020T16:00:29,BeautyAndTheBeef,I dont know what to make of that information
08-08-2020T16:00:41,AspiringNoodle,I'd want to live forever :D
08-08-2020T16:00:42,ThingsAreMoving,I would certainly like to live a bit longer than normal
08-08-2020T16:00:49,AspiringNoodle,"As long as I had an ""end it all button"" available"
08-08-2020T16:00:54,ThingsAreMoving,So many experiences to have
08-08-2020T16:01:05,BeautyAndTheBeef,My psychologist told me I´m not human enough so I guess I could live forever
08-08-2020T16:01:06,CrimsonQuill,STREM

08-08-2020T16:01:45,AspiringNoodle,Maybe that'll give us enough time to see Twokinds finished :ptv-snicker:

08-08-2020T16:01:56,CrimsonQuill,It's over 9000!
08-08-2020T16:01:56,BeautyAndTheBeef,more of TK
08-08-2020T16:02:01,InTheLionsDen,That would be bad for the environment.
08-08-2020T16:02:09,Brocade,"People would have fewer kids, though"
08-08-2020T16:02:11,Brocade,Hi Tom!
08-08-2020T16:02:17,ProsePro7,Move to other planets by then hopefully
08-08-2020T16:02:17,CrimsonQuill,Hello Tom!
08-08-2020T16:02:31,AspiringNoodle,Think of it this way
08-08-2020T16:02:42,AspiringNoodle,"If we could extend human life by that much, imagine how quickly we could make progress"
08-08-2020T16:02:57,AspiringNoodle,The great minds driving forward progress could now continue their work for longer
08-08-2020T16:02:58,BeautyAndTheBeef,We are already its exponential
08-08-2020T16:03:01,CrimsonQuill,...Are you sure about that?
08-08-2020T16:03:25,CrimsonQuill,"Something tells me that progress would be resisted more, because of entrenched beliefs having a major foothold now."
08-08-2020T16:03:38,BeautyAndTheBeef,"You could learn anything you want, try every job, every hobby"
08-08-2020T16:03:44,CrimsonQuill,Those who resisted such new ideas could block them for longer.
08-08-2020T16:03:44,AspiringNoodle,"I'm not talking ideological progress, I'm talking technological"
08-08-2020T16:03:50,CrimsonQuill,So am I.
08-08-2020T16:04:00,CrimsonQuill,There are always those who fight technological progress.
