26-07-2020T00:00:50,CrRAR,Diced
26-07-2020T00:01:07,CrRAR,Carmel too soft
26-07-2020T00:01:17,AspiringNoodle,"And then cooked peppers, mild pepper rings, or regular old pepper?"
26-07-2020T00:01:20,CrRAR,That for steak
26-07-2020T00:01:38,CrRAR,Reg... ular I guess?
26-07-2020T00:01:49,AspiringNoodle,"Cause that's the sprinkle sprinkle kind, lol"

26-07-2020T00:02:16,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-maddiessparkles:
26-07-2020T00:02:27,AspiringNoodle,the cooked peppers are green peppers
26-07-2020T00:02:42,CrRAR,Then that probably
26-07-2020T00:03:02,AspiringNoodle,"And lastly, did you want any bacon, pepperoni, or double the meat?"
26-07-2020T00:03:16,CrRAR,:ptv-pouty: no
26-07-2020T00:03:53,AspiringNoodle,"Alrighty then, a half steak sub with pretzel roll, swiss, malt vinegar, diced onions and cooked peppers will cost you $4.60 + tax"
26-07-2020T00:04:01,AspiringNoodle,:D
26-07-2020T00:04:33,AspiringNoodle,That's actually pretty decent
26-07-2020T00:05:09,CrRAR,Wow
26-07-2020T00:05:15,AspiringNoodle,A whole sub will bring that up to $8.49 + tax

26-07-2020T00:06:07,AspiringNoodle,"I forgot the ""ultimate"" topper section"
26-07-2020T00:06:29,AspiringNoodle,"Thats where you can add something on the side (aka, don't have to add it later after searching the menu), or on top"
26-07-2020T00:06:51,CrRAR,Coleslaw if it‚Äôs quality ‚Äòslaw
26-07-2020T00:06:59,AspiringNoodle,"So you could add a fried egg on top, or fryze, jalapeno poppers, mac and cheese bites, mozzarella sticks, or onion rings on top or to the side"
26-07-2020T00:07:05,AspiringNoodle,fryz*
26-07-2020T00:07:31,CrRAR,wow
26-07-2020T00:07:59,AspiringNoodle,Theres the link if you wanna mess around in the menu

26-07-2020T00:10:15,CrRAR,Almost like a standalone mall food court xD
26-07-2020T00:11:01,AspiringNoodle,Except they no have nuggies :c
26-07-2020T00:11:15,AspiringNoodle,"boneless chicken, strips, & popcorn yes, but no nuggies"
26-07-2020T00:11:24,CrRAR,Yeah OR mushrooms
26-07-2020T00:11:26,CrRAR,Oh
26-07-2020T00:11:34,CrRAR,Those are good options
26-07-2020T00:11:58,AspiringNoodle,what'd you find?
26-07-2020T00:12:16,CrRAR,"No, the chicky strips"

26-07-2020T00:12:44,AspiringNoodle,Have you ever had boom boom sauce?
26-07-2020T00:14:17,CrRAR,Oo classiq grilled cheese
26-07-2020T00:14:46,AspiringNoodle,"I love getting that with cheddar and swiss, and then some buffalo sauce :ptv-hearts:"
26-07-2020T00:15:03,AspiringNoodle,Their buffalo sauce is a bit strong in the flavor department
26-07-2020T00:15:16,AspiringNoodle,Is like someone took the tangy knob and cranked it to 11
26-07-2020T00:15:34,AspiringNoodle,"But if you pair it with something that tone's it down, is nice"
26-07-2020T00:16:15,CrRAR,Oh they have melts(z) too
26-07-2020T00:16:23,AspiringNoodle,See what I mean?
26-07-2020T00:16:37,AspiringNoodle,"Sadly, if I want to keep below $6 for regular eating, I gotta get cheaper stuff ^^;"
26-07-2020T00:16:51,CrRAR,Pulled pork or ham melt also sounds good
26-07-2020T00:17:05,AspiringNoodle,At least their personal pizzas are either $2.99 or $3.29 a pop
26-07-2020T00:17:11,AspiringNoodle,"I can't remember which, but all 3 kinds are the same price"
26-07-2020T00:18:17,AspiringNoodle,"On the bright side, their regular hot dogs are 2 for $1.00"
26-07-2020T00:18:28,AspiringNoodle,"They're what you expect, but hey :snail:"

26-07-2020T20:04:15,AspiringNoodle,Are you familiar with Hideo Kojima?
26-07-2020T20:07:18,CrRAR,a bit
26-07-2020T20:07:38,CrRAR,MGS and P.T. and Death Stranding
26-07-2020T20:07:43,AspiringNoodle,How about Junji Ito?
26-07-2020T20:08:01,CrRAR,Yeah that's the horror visionary guy
26-07-2020T20:08:13,CrRAR,Did he work on Silent Hill stuff?
26-07-2020T20:08:37,CrRAR,or is he the guy with the spirals horror stuff?

26-07-2020T20:10:17,CrRAR,"Actually there was a theory about PT, the map was a hallway, but supposedly it was a ref to ito because the hallway descended slightly before you ""looped"" so effectively the map path was a downward spiral"
26-07-2020T20:11:21,AspiringNoodle,They might be teaming up to make a game c:
26-07-2020T20:12:05,AspiringNoodle,"Also, I recommend Enigma of Amigara Fault"
26-07-2020T20:12:10,AspiringNoodle,Talk about existential horror
26-07-2020T20:13:35,AspiringNoodle,"Oooooooooooooooooooooo, Kojima is apparently a man of similar tastes"
26-07-2020T20:13:54,CrRAR,he's a huge film nerd apparently lol

26-07-2020T20:14:38,AspiringNoodle,I too experience similar fear
26-07-2020T20:14:51,CrRAR,One thing about Hideo is he gets very complex about symbolism. It's like symbolism overload.
26-07-2020T20:15:03,AspiringNoodle,Fear of the unknown.  What happens when you don't know?  What happens when you are deprived of your senses in an environment?

26-07-2020T20:15:49,AspiringNoodle,Here's something interesting from Resident Evil 7
26-07-2020T20:15:57,AspiringNoodle,Apparently they had another monster they had originally planned
26-07-2020T20:16:11,AspiringNoodle,But the damn thing was so terrifying they worried for people's health
26-07-2020T20:16:19,CrRAR,oh was it found in the game files or something?
26-07-2020T20:16:27,AspiringNoodle,"That, or revealed by developers"
26-07-2020T20:16:39,AspiringNoodle,"The character would've been like a caretaker, but resided in the swamp"
26-07-2020T20:16:47,CrRAR,I remember back when they discovered the Juggarnaut in Halo 2 code and assets or whatever
26-07-2020T20:16:59,CrRAR,Like another larger Flood form
