02-12-2020T00:01:55,AspiringNoodle,8 Secret Video Game Bosses You Must NEVER Find
02-12-2020T00:02:03,AspiringNoodle,#1: Uranus - Bloody Roar 3
02-12-2020T00:02:42,AspiringNoodle,"""Why'd they name this boss Uranus?"""
02-12-2020T00:02:48,AspiringNoodle,"""Because that's what she's about to destroy."""
02-12-2020T00:02:51,AspiringNoodle,"""O///O"""
02-12-2020T00:04:05,AspiringNoodle,Apparently the boss was what you get if you take every bad fighting game design and roll it into one character.
02-12-2020T00:05:12,AspiringNoodle,"Teleportation, nearly omnipresent block, Little to no wind-up on devastating attacks, attacks that look like they'll hit one way, but instantly transition to another halfway through the animation."
02-12-2020T00:09:20,Dadrobit,I did have Bloody Roar 2 back in yonder day myself. Spent many an hour with my little brother on that game.
02-12-2020T00:11:54,AspiringNoodle,Uranus makes some of the infamous Street Fighter / Mortal Kombat bosses look like a joke
02-12-2020T00:12:19,AspiringNoodle,"Because on top of everything else, she also has a beast form that boosts her attack power while keeping her human-form's speed."

02-12-2020T09:53:43,Dadrobit,"Mmmm, I feel that. When I was working purely from home, it is super hard to keep to a ""normal"" schedule."
02-12-2020T09:55:03,Dadrobit,"I wish you excellent luck with the stream today though. Just took some melatonin after cleaning up the house a bit, and now it is time to konk off."

02-12-2020T10:45:31,Folfy,its all good
02-12-2020T10:45:34,TeapotOfDoom,fair but this is still an english chat
02-12-2020T10:45:41,Folfy,I guess you could mix the 2
02-12-2020T10:45:49,TeapotOfDoom,so please either talk in english or keep it in whispers
02-12-2020T10:45:53,iliar,I have a question with a Russian in the chat. What's the point of speaking Russian in this chat?
02-12-2020T10:46:00,TeapotOfDoom,^
02-12-2020T10:46:03,Folfy,there are fellow russians
02-12-2020T10:46:15,CommanderTrace,English is also not my native language but im trying to speak as good as i can ;D
02-12-2020T10:46:22,Kiwipower,To communicate
02-12-2020T10:46:28,Kiwipower,Why else?
02-12-2020T10:46:29,Folfy,Indeed
02-12-2020T10:46:57,CrRAR,"iliar also knows russian, but keeps to english :)"

02-12-2020T10:48:35,Folfy,dang
02-12-2020T10:49:25,Kiwipower,If there‚Äôs more Russians isn‚Äôt it technically a Russian chat?
02-12-2020T10:49:29,iliar,There are many people for whom English is not their native language. But it will be very silly if everyone speaks different languages.
02-12-2020T10:49:29,iliar,"In this chat, everyone speaks English. This is a way to understand each other."
02-12-2020T10:49:48,CommanderTrace,yeah ;D

02-12-2020T10:52:46,TEG0KOK,?
02-12-2020T10:52:51,KipArto,indeed
02-12-2020T10:53:11,KipArto,I haven't read twokinds in so long. I'm WAY behind
02-12-2020T10:53:20,Folfy,I tried to read it with a friend
02-12-2020T10:53:27,KipArto,I have no idea who anyone is in that comic anymore
02-12-2020T10:53:39,CrRAR,anyone!?
02-12-2020T10:53:41,Folfy,time to list characters :)
02-12-2020T10:53:48,Folfy,we got Nora in this right now
02-12-2020T10:53:49,Kiwipower,"It updates pretty slow, you could catch up if you want"
02-12-2020T10:53:59,Tharkis,:ctharkis-earwiggle:
02-12-2020T10:54:03,Folfy,it about what a page a week?
02-12-2020T10:54:10,KipArto,"yeah, it's been so long I've forgotten all the names."
02-12-2020T10:54:11,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-nibsbounce: hi tharkis
02-12-2020T10:54:12,Kiwipower,Yea
02-12-2020T10:54:22,KipArto,it'd pretty much have to start from scratch
02-12-2020T10:54:25,Folfy,yeah me and my friend did a read through it was pretty fun
02-12-2020T10:54:31,Tharkis,must...give...nora....headpats!!  :ctharkis-uneasy:
02-12-2020T10:54:43,Folfy,we tried to do voices but well i got stuck with female cast. My voice doesn't got that high anymore.
02-12-2020T10:54:49,Folfy,go*
02-12-2020T10:54:55,CrRAR,haha
02-12-2020T10:55:17,Folfy,half of the time it would crack but it was fun either way I got to ask him if we can keep going

02-12-2020T10:56:15,Twokinds,It's not like you have to go into some crazy falsetto. Most audiobooks with a male reader tends to just go up a little when voicing female characters.
02-12-2020T10:56:27,CrRAR,tru
02-12-2020T10:56:29,Folfy,yeah thanks tom ill be sure to do that next time
02-12-2020T10:56:38,CrRAR,teensy inflection
02-12-2020T10:56:48,Folfy,indeed just got to find that right point
02-12-2020T10:56:57,CrRAR,"Plus, some of the wolves have more throaty voices anyway"
02-12-2020T10:57:04,TeapotOfDoom,^
02-12-2020T10:57:08,Folfy,yeah I actual tried that it felt like it worked
02-12-2020T10:57:08,Kiwipower,I wonder what Tom imagines they‚Äôre voices to sound like
02-12-2020T10:57:12,Folfy,true kiwi
02-12-2020T10:57:47,TeapotOfDoom,inb4 sythe sounds like Louis Armstrong
02-12-2020T10:58:14,Tharkis,"trace, voiced by James Earl Jones"

02-12-2020T11:03:50,Tharkis,trace aging backwards! /panic
02-12-2020T11:04:42,iliar,About the voice acting of female characters. Some voice actors are good at working with their voices. Somewhere I saw a guy who specializes in anime voice acting.
02-12-2020T11:04:43,BaskervilleNQH,Aging backwards? That sounds liek dragon shenanigargles to me.
02-12-2020T11:04:45,iliar,"That is, when you watch anime and see a cute girl say ""oniisan"" in a sweet voice there is chances are you are actually hearing a male voice."
02-12-2020T11:04:52,iliar,Live with it.

02-12-2020T11:09:12,TheSexyBeast,"Okay, coffee is brewing. Nora's are looking amazing."
02-12-2020T11:09:12,BaskervilleNQH,The top looks nice. it's lower half is very remeniscent of a translucent mesh~
02-12-2020T11:09:23,Hopefighter,"Wow, what's this? A stream I can acctualy watch rather than just dipping in at the start?"
02-12-2020T11:09:40,KipArto,lol

02-12-2020T11:12:37,Doombat,Can nora fit in any box
02-12-2020T11:13:02,Folfy,perhaps that is for Tom to decide
02-12-2020T11:13:11,TheSexyBeast,Schr√∂dinger's Nora
02-12-2020T11:13:26,sunblaze,its not about how much of Nora fits in a box. but how much of those pesky boxex fit around Nora!
02-12-2020T11:13:34,Hopefighter,they are and simultaniously aren't Nora
02-12-2020T11:13:57,BaskervilleNQH,"Dragon sat in a dock crate. ""If I fits. I sits"""
02-12-2020T11:14:25,Folfy,crate proceeds to break. Angy Nora noises.

02-12-2020T11:17:20,Tharkis,feral kitty nora is totally adorable
02-12-2020T11:17:22,BaskervilleNQH,There's a bit in the song that sounds like my telephone ring and I was just vastly confused XD

02-12-2020T11:18:21,Folfy,hello falangie

02-12-2020T11:18:58,Folfy,i think
02-12-2020T11:19:02,Folfy,Tom did one once
02-12-2020T11:19:08,Twokinds,She probably couldn't go much smaller than a cat.
02-12-2020T11:19:40,BaskervilleNQH,Mhmm. She's a lot of power to condense in one being liek that.
02-12-2020T11:19:43,Tharkis,"little kitty cat nora is purrr-fect though, she's got beans ! :ctharkis-paw:"
02-12-2020T11:19:55,sunblaze,so its not outlawed to kills white mice theen?
02-12-2020T11:20:09,KipArto,oh... okay I think I get it now. they're all Nora?

02-12-2020T11:22:01,sunblaze,5 that wee see in the pic. maybe the viewer is another Nora?
02-12-2020T11:22:05,sunblaze,:ptv-laugh:
02-12-2020T11:22:16,Hopefighter,... I wish man
02-12-2020T11:22:18,BaskervilleNQH,We are all Nora.
02-12-2020T11:22:39,KipArto,I wonder if Nora can pick and choose parts from each form to incorporate into her design.  Like smol Kitty Nora with long Dragon Neck
02-12-2020T11:22:45,sunblaze,we are legion! (of Noras)
02-12-2020T11:23:05,Hopefighter,if anything we are mostly Erics

02-12-2020T11:23:36,Folfy,its been done before
02-12-2020T11:23:44,Hopefighter,just look at the suggestions each stream... okay granted one of those is usually from me
02-12-2020T11:23:46,Dimensional,Nora is one of the easiest characters to paint. Just color the background.
02-12-2020T11:23:50,Folfy,ha
02-12-2020T11:23:51,Hopefighter,but the others voted on it!
02-12-2020T11:23:54,BaskervilleNQH,Character fusions?
02-12-2020T11:23:56,TheSexyBeast,Flora Nora?
02-12-2020T11:24:13,Folfy,hmmm that would be interesting
02-12-2020T11:24:21,Folfy,Trace I'm a dragon now!
02-12-2020T11:24:37,sunblaze,did we not already see one? I could have sworn
02-12-2020T11:24:42,Hopefighter,pretty sure we allready had a dragon flora at some point
02-12-2020T11:24:47,Folfy,perhapes

02-12-2020T11:25:37,TheSexyBeast,Tiger + Dragon would be an interesting amalgamation
02-12-2020T11:25:40,KipArto,"main characters, sub characters, NPCs"
02-12-2020T11:26:01,sunblaze,Flora is no tiger. more like a accidently striped kitty :P

02-12-2020T11:29:43,sunblaze,oh man I did not think of that Kip
02-12-2020T11:29:46,Tharkis,:ctharkis-ewok:
02-12-2020T11:29:49,sunblaze,now I am unable to forget it :P

02-12-2020T11:30:46,AmbivalentMrLit,I'm here for good vibes.

02-12-2020T11:30:52,AmbivalentMrLit,Let's spread good vibes
02-12-2020T11:31:02,sunblaze,PC: go fuck yourself! Nora: how many times? PC: wait what?
02-12-2020T11:31:22,Folfy,surprise stream
02-12-2020T11:31:29,KipArto,Nora: Just once? Hardly worth the effort.
02-12-2020T11:31:57,sunblaze,"yes Nora ""convinced"" Tom that she is a sneaky surprising dragon so sneaky surprising stream!"
02-12-2020T11:31:57,Tharkis,"nora is awesome  in any form, but her bipedal forms are extra cute because of their clumsiness.   Such a powerful being being so clumsy on her feet is somehow quite endearing"
02-12-2020T11:32:52,Folfy,Sunblaze now that you say that I think that might be true!
02-12-2020T11:33:29,Dimensional,Love how her feet have thumbs
02-12-2020T11:33:43,AmbivalentMrLit,Makes you twice as dextrous
02-12-2020T11:34:00,HiddenWorlds,Early stream?
02-12-2020T11:34:05,sunblaze,indeed she might not use the human form but why deny all the others some thumbs?
02-12-2020T11:34:06,BaskervilleNQH,Twice the grabby
02-12-2020T11:34:12,AmbivalentMrLit,Grab me
02-12-2020T11:34:26,Hopefighter,"okay I checked, we've seen dragon flora in two sketches, one in Nov 2016 and one in Sept 2018"
02-12-2020T11:34:26,Dimensional,Egads! She's not wearing any pants!
02-12-2020T11:34:40,KipArto,none of them are
02-12-2020T11:34:44,sunblaze,ah research hopefighter? niiice :P
02-12-2020T11:34:54,AmbivalentMrLit,Pants just get in the way of not wearing pants
02-12-2020T11:34:54,BaskervilleNQH,"None of us are, either."
02-12-2020T11:35:12,sunblaze,^kinky
02-12-2020T11:35:19,Dimensional,Pants: A butt trap for dragons

02-12-2020T11:36:36,TheSexyBeast,an oversized tee for me
02-12-2020T11:36:39,sunblaze,hm interesting that the tiny forms do not have slitted pupils but the more anthro ones do
02-12-2020T11:36:57,TerraTheWizard,"wait, i can't time"
02-12-2020T11:37:05,KipArto,i have a question
02-12-2020T11:37:05,TerraTheWizard,it started an hour after i went for a nap
02-12-2020T11:37:20,TerraTheWizard,and i only just woke up
02-12-2020T11:37:30,KipArto,why is it the sexiest thing a partner can wear always happens to be My Shirt from the night before?
02-12-2020T11:37:55,AmbivalentMrLit,I noticed that too
02-12-2020T11:38:07,TheSexyBeast,Because it's yours
02-12-2020T11:38:07,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
02-12-2020T11:38:10,AmbivalentMrLit,It's probably because of the intimacy it reminds you of
02-12-2020T11:38:12,falangie123,"ah, a question as old as time"
02-12-2020T11:39:14,KipArto,I think I just found my next pin up idea.
02-12-2020T11:39:31,KipArto,a sexy vixen wearing a shirt that's way too big for her
02-12-2020T11:40:16,Hopefighter,it's gonna be mike isn't it Kip?
02-12-2020T11:40:32,TheSexyBeast,VV Mike in an oversized tee?
02-12-2020T11:40:58,TheSexyBeast,I approve!

02-12-2020T11:42:11,Folfy,hello
02-12-2020T11:42:39,KipArto,"to be fair iliar, that was one we all knew we had deep down"
02-12-2020T11:43:12,KipArto,"Hopefighter, who is Mike?"
02-12-2020T11:44:21,Tharkis,pretty wing effect
02-12-2020T11:44:53,Hopefighter,"the resident fox, who mostly is turned female in suggestion because it suits him err her... them. it suits them"
02-12-2020T11:44:54,Dimensional,"Next up, the Many forms of Princess Reni sitting together. I'm sure she'll be concerned, especially if a certain other dragon crashes her party"
02-12-2020T11:45:19,TEG0KOK,Hi/–ü—Ä–∏–≤–µ—Ç
02-12-2020T11:46:08,Folfy,Kiparto Mike is a fox who was a slave underneath Eric. But he didn't mind it.
02-12-2020T11:46:32,sunblaze,Reni should take Noras education on how to turn into something.
02-12-2020T11:46:37,Folfy,eventually Nora did a illusion that turned him into Very Vixen Mike. And now that's what happened
02-12-2020T11:46:42,sunblaze,pure edicational purpose naturally
02-12-2020T11:46:45,Folfy,indeed
02-12-2020T11:47:28,Dimensional,It was the pen that made VV Mike.
02-12-2020T11:47:34,Folfy,indeed
02-12-2020T11:47:41,Dimensional,"Nora only used an illusion to make Mike appear like a normal vixen, not a busty one"
02-12-2020T11:47:44,Folfy,true
02-12-2020T11:47:46,Folfy,my bad
02-12-2020T11:47:55,starcat13,Can Nora transforms to the pen? )
02-12-2020T11:48:05,Dimensional,"The Pen also made VV Clovis, and something for Flora."
02-12-2020T11:48:09,Hopefighter,plot twist: nora is the one controling the pen
02-12-2020T11:48:17,sunblaze,√é was jsut gonna write that :D
02-12-2020T11:48:18,Dimensional,"No, Nora can't transform the pen. The pen is more powerful than the Sw-Nora."
02-12-2020T11:48:49,Hopefighter,Sketch-verse lore
02-12-2020T11:48:50,Dimensional,"Well, Nora did once control the pen, when she tried to 'improve' Tom's story. XD"
02-12-2020T11:49:05,Folfy,ha yeah
02-12-2020T11:49:37,Folfy,I dunno if I should eat
02-12-2020T11:50:19,Dimensional,"If your hungry and not worried about any weight gain, I recommend eating."
02-12-2020T11:50:30,sunblaze,yeah survival > art
02-12-2020T11:50:34,Folfy,alright then Ima go find something to eat then
02-12-2020T11:50:36,KipArto,"i recommend eating anyway, it doesn't have to be a lot"
02-12-2020T11:50:52,Folfy,"like a poptart. As Mark says ""There Crazy Good!"""
02-12-2020T11:51:07,Dimensional,"Yeah, but..... recent stuff...... nevermind"
02-12-2020T11:52:49,AmbivalentMrLit,That's a nice silk bed they're on. I'd love one like that
02-12-2020T11:53:05,sunblaze,only the bed or the dragons included?
02-12-2020T11:53:13,AmbivalentMrLit,Yes
02-12-2020T11:53:21,sunblaze,:ptv-snicker:
02-12-2020T11:54:14,AmbivalentMrLit,Can I ride the dragon?
02-12-2020T11:54:22,AmbivalentMrLit,I want to get out of tier 3

02-12-2020T12:03:25,AmbivalentMrLit,Gloves and hats are for pussies
02-12-2020T12:03:40,iliar,"Tom, I don't know how you do it, but the colors are very cool."
02-12-2020T12:03:49,BaskervilleNQH,And cyclists.
02-12-2020T12:03:59,microbuss,"hey! I resemble that remark, Ambival!"

02-12-2020T12:04:33,AmbivalentMrLit,I'm gonna leave you all for now while I find dinner.

02-12-2020T12:05:01,microbuss,you ARE dinner! *noms*
02-12-2020T12:05:16,BaskervilleNQH,The bed colour is a godo choice.
02-12-2020T12:05:18,Folfy,ahem would that be a vore good sir
02-12-2020T12:05:41,Twokinds,Thank you! I tried to get some colors that looked nice.
02-12-2020T12:05:52,Twokinds,"It was hard, because it's all white on grey on white with all these characters."
02-12-2020T12:06:23,Folfy,It looks really good Tom!
02-12-2020T12:06:31,BaskervilleNQH,It's good. It contrasts well with the eyes and generally isn't a 'noisy colour'
02-12-2020T12:06:38,Folfy,the dark and light purple really do mix well with teh white
02-12-2020T12:06:47,Twokinds,I knew I needed a really dark background to contrast Nora's white coloring
02-12-2020T12:06:49,Folfy,it isn't to overbearing on the eyes looks soft and nice
02-12-2020T12:06:56,Folfy,ye

02-12-2020T12:07:34,TeapotOfDoom,"the high contrast with dark purple really gives her white some ""color"""

02-12-2020T12:08:18,MotoNeko,Teapot! How's the avatar? ;D
02-12-2020T12:08:59,iliar,Yes I know. White and black are very difficult for artists.
02-12-2020T12:09:11,iliar,"If you want to paint a black car, you cannot paint with pure black paint. You just get a black spot. You should always use additional shades."
02-12-2020T12:09:15,iliar,And it's the same with white.
02-12-2020T12:09:23,MotoNeko,"Oh, a small Nora?"
02-12-2020T12:09:49,Xexanoth,Wonder how much Nora has to pay for electricity bills with all these glowing eyes :ptv-SteelwormHades:
02-12-2020T12:09:56,iliar,I think this art will look good as a poster.
02-12-2020T12:10:04,MotoNeko,She IS the electricity bill
02-12-2020T12:10:12,TeapotOfDoom,oh boi yeah it would
02-12-2020T12:10:30,Twokinds,Yeah I think white and black are the most challanging for me
02-12-2020T12:10:42,Twokinds,It's why I struggle with night scenes
02-12-2020T12:11:01,TeapotOfDoom,looks at Study Kat
02-12-2020T12:11:07,TeapotOfDoom,struggle?

02-12-2020T12:17:25,falangie123,im not criticising here but human noras torso looks absurdly long
02-12-2020T12:17:26,Animexs,phone wallpaper approval
02-12-2020T12:17:27,iliar,It looks great.
02-12-2020T12:17:39,Roughlandin,Oh hey! Bonus mini Nora!
02-12-2020T12:17:56,MotoNeko,@Animexs :thumbsup:
02-12-2020T12:18:41,iliar,"Although to be honest, I have some small comments about the top. I don't think a center seam is needed on the bottom"
02-12-2020T12:19:18,MotoNeko,What's a center seam?
02-12-2020T12:19:24,MotoNeko,Oh
02-12-2020T12:19:34,TeapotOfDoom,the thing that's gone now
02-12-2020T12:19:42,Roughlandin,"I like it! Good eye, Iliar"
02-12-2020T12:19:57,MotoNeko,I dont mind either :D
02-12-2020T12:19:59,TeapotOfDoom,but now her chest looks a bit off
02-12-2020T12:20:12,Folfy,I think it still looks fine
02-12-2020T12:20:13,iliar,"And since the fabric is translucent, the chest is visible through it."
02-12-2020T12:20:20,Folfy,maybe my eyes aren't catching it
02-12-2020T12:20:29,TeapotOfDoom,looks like she's wearing a tshirt underneath
02-12-2020T12:20:41,MotoNeko,@Iliar good thinking
02-12-2020T12:21:00,Twokinds,I'm not particularly fashionably minded
02-12-2020T12:21:09,Roughlandin,Coulda fooled me
02-12-2020T12:21:27,TeapotOfDoom,:ctwokinds-KatDance:*[Who needs clothes?]
02-12-2020T12:21:41,iliar,I do not know how this part of the body is correctly called in English. But through the semi transparent fabric it should be visible that there is a dimple between the breasts.
02-12-2020T12:21:46,MotoNeko,Huys like me need clothes. It should be illegal otherwise XD
02-12-2020T12:21:49,Hopefighter,considering you aren't you sure create some really cool outfits tom
02-12-2020T12:21:57,Roughlandin,"Cleavage, Iliar? Lol"
02-12-2020T12:22:01,TheSexyBeast,Back
02-12-2020T12:22:10,TeapotOfDoom,yeah probably the word

02-12-2020T12:23:08,MotoNeko,"I dont get it, SexyBeast √≥.0"
02-12-2020T12:23:14,iliar,Just imagine how you would draw the chest if there were no fabric in this place and you sing what I mean.
02-12-2020T12:23:27,Roughlandin,"Go whole cream, beast. Live a little"
02-12-2020T12:23:44,MotoNeko,I wish i could draw good breasts at all.
02-12-2020T12:23:54,Roughlandin,I wish I could draw good at all
02-12-2020T12:24:01,falangie123,same
02-12-2020T12:24:30,Folfy,now I have advanced into 3rd period
02-12-2020T12:24:57,Twokinds,Well when you're wearing clothes everything gets pushed together. It'd be different if there were no fabric.
02-12-2020T12:25:04,MotoNeko,Sometimes i wish one could just transfer their knowledge to improve
02-12-2020T12:25:36,Roughlandin,Every line is looking better
02-12-2020T12:25:37,iliar,Thanks Tom. I think this change makes the design of the top more interesting.
02-12-2020T12:25:54,TeapotOfDoom,and make her look a lot lewder for that matter
02-12-2020T12:25:55,Twokinds,haha yes 'interesting'
02-12-2020T12:26:09,TeapotOfDoom,:ctwokinds-MikeLewd:
02-12-2020T12:26:12,Roughlandin,And the age gate slams shut that much faster
02-12-2020T12:26:40,MotoNeko,What does it feel like to be a shapeshifting dragon like Nora who can just freely roam and nobody can stop her
02-12-2020T12:26:54,Folfy,I mean she is Nora after all
02-12-2020T12:26:57,Roughlandin,"Let it never be said that Nora was anything but ""interesting"""
02-12-2020T12:26:59,Folfy,she does what she wants
02-12-2020T12:27:13,Roughlandin,Would YOU like to tell the demigod what to do?
02-12-2020T12:27:18,Folfy,mabye
02-12-2020T12:27:24,Roughlandin,*FIRE-BREATHING demigod
02-12-2020T12:27:31,Folfy,okay not so much but still
02-12-2020T12:27:45,Folfy,its like a 50% chance of either it going south or it going north
02-12-2020T12:28:06,TeapotOfDoom,well i must say that it looks pretty convincing to me
02-12-2020T12:28:12,sunblaze,I am pretty sure she has more tricks up her sleeve then jsut firebreath and shapeshifting. but yes be wary of cute white fuzzy stings that look AND grin at you for no reason :D
02-12-2020T12:28:19,MotoNeko,What could a shapeshifting dragon do for me?
02-12-2020T12:28:42,Roughlandin,Ask not what the shapeshifting dragon can do for you. Ask what YOU can do for HER
02-12-2020T12:28:51,Roughlandin,Very. Politely.
02-12-2020T12:28:59,sunblaze,^bow a lot
02-12-2020T12:29:01,TeapotOfDoom,"actually tom, would she be able to pull off something like this? or would the others just be illusions?"
02-12-2020T12:29:04,iliar,"""It'd be different if there were no fabric"" - Not really. A friend of mine has a dress with a similar design."
02-12-2020T12:29:05,iliar,"For certain reasons, I cannot show the photo. But trust me, it looks pretty similar with ""no fabric""."
02-12-2020T12:29:23,FreelancerAgentMaine,"Why is there an early stream, im literally in my calculus class right now"
02-12-2020T12:29:33,Roughlandin,Tom streams when Tom likes
02-12-2020T12:29:35,Roughlandin,;p
02-12-2020T12:29:36,Folfy,ha im in geometry
02-12-2020T12:29:41,Folfy,nora told him to
02-12-2020T12:29:41,Hogan,To give some of us a sporting chance of watching :p
02-12-2020T12:29:42,sunblaze,well there are 5 dragons divide by 2!
02-12-2020T12:29:47,Hopefighter,the best thing that can happen to you when you annoy nora is you stay humanoid... let's not talk about the worst
02-12-2020T12:29:53,Twokinds,"Maybe. Nora can make illusions, so certainly that. But making actually bodies? I'm not sure if that's within her power."
02-12-2020T12:29:58,Folfy,true
02-12-2020T12:30:01,Twokinds,"In the mindscape, easy."
02-12-2020T12:30:17,Roughlandin,...So she's in our minds
02-12-2020T12:30:26,Hopefighter,she lives there rent free
02-12-2020T12:30:26,MotoNeko,If it was within her power she technicly would never be lonely. She'd always have a chess buddy
02-12-2020T12:30:29,HuskyCookie,And in our hearts ! <3
02-12-2020T12:30:30,Roughlandin,That puts an... intriguing twist on this piece
02-12-2020T12:30:52,Twokinds,Nora promotes self confidence. Love Thyself.
02-12-2020T12:31:06,Folfy,ooo
02-12-2020T12:31:12,Twokinds,Though... perhaps not quite as much as Nora.
02-12-2020T12:31:13,TeapotOfDoom,:ctwokinds-NoraEyebrows:
02-12-2020T12:31:13,Dimensional,"She probably could request possession of other bodies, temporarily ofcourse, for the scene... That, or this picture was drawn by Eric"
02-12-2020T12:31:16,Folfy,thank you Nora
02-12-2020T12:31:20,FreelancerAgentMaine,"Id rather not, too much work"
02-12-2020T12:31:21,TeapotOfDoom,lol
02-12-2020T12:31:21,MotoNeko,If i could copy myself then life would be so much easier.
02-12-2020T12:31:23,Roughlandin,Don't call it narcissism if you're this beautiful
02-12-2020T12:31:34,Hopefighter,"""love yourself almost as much as you love me"" -Nora"
02-12-2020T12:31:43,Folfy,Moto what if those copies rebel?
02-12-2020T12:31:48,MotoNeko,Oh i could not love myself that much
02-12-2020T12:31:49,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
02-12-2020T12:32:01,MotoNeko,@Folfy I'd reabsorb them
02-12-2020T12:32:16,iliar,"In the mindscape she can actually even seducing Trace. It is more difficult than ""making a body"""
02-12-2020T12:32:32,MotoNeko,My idea is i would create clones to do multiple things and then reabsorb them and our memories.
02-12-2020T12:32:36,MotoNeko,Like Naruto
02-12-2020T12:32:38,Roughlandin,"In HER mindscape maybe, lol"
02-12-2020T12:32:49,Roughlandin,Ooh! CUTE!
02-12-2020T12:32:58,Folfy,oh dang Moto I didn't think of that
02-12-2020T12:33:01,MotoNeko,"Oh dang, Natani's younger self is taking over"
02-12-2020T12:33:02,Swingdragon,CUTE NATANI!!!
02-12-2020T12:33:09,Folfy,oooo
02-12-2020T12:33:10,Roughlandin,Here comes the slimebag chair! I am excite!
02-12-2020T12:33:13,Folfy,here we go
02-12-2020T12:33:22,Twokinds,I mean that's the story of Willow Wisp
02-12-2020T12:33:45,Roughlandin,Oh yeah
02-12-2020T12:33:50,Twokinds,"She's a split off piece of her ""mother"" that ran away."
02-12-2020T12:34:10,MotoNeko,"@Folfy it would be the awesome way to do it. That way there wouldnt be an existential question of ""Am i real anymore?"" and there wouldnt be a need for the clones to rebel."
02-12-2020T12:34:19,Roughlandin,"I'd imagining fracturing yourself like that would also lessen your mana, though"
02-12-2020T12:34:33,Roughlandin,"Proportional to how strong the new ""you"" is"
02-12-2020T12:34:58,Folfy,yeah absorb
02-12-2020T12:34:59,MotoNeko,Reabsorbing the clones and memories mean you are always you and become one. Even for the most simple of tasks :D
02-12-2020T12:35:20,Folfy,just like if 1 clone experienced something then you could also remember that.
02-12-2020T12:35:29,Roughlandin,Nose. Want to boop.
02-12-2020T12:35:32,MotoNeko,Precisely :D
02-12-2020T12:35:36,Roughlandin,She bleppy
02-12-2020T12:36:08,Folfy,dang my hands are shaking again
02-12-2020T12:36:17,MotoNeko,"One clone could do dishes, one could walk the dogs while the original just works infront of the computer. Nothing lost since technicly all will experience each in the end."
02-12-2020T12:36:43,Hopefighter,blep
02-12-2020T12:36:46,Folfy,bloop
02-12-2020T12:36:53,Folfy,microwave go bRRRRRRRRR

02-12-2020T12:47:33,Folfy,oh its raw egg hmmmhmhmhm
02-12-2020T12:48:23,Roughlandin,Eh. Most store bought eggnog doesn't actually have raw egg in it
02-12-2020T12:48:25,Twokinds,not all eggnog is raw
02-12-2020T12:48:31,Roughlandin,^
02-12-2020T12:48:36,Folfy,ah cool
02-12-2020T12:48:43,FreelancerAgentMaine,"Mmmmm, raw potato time"

02-12-2020T12:49:02,Folfy,1 school food I don't mind is a baked potato
02-12-2020T12:49:10,Folfy,also perhaps its irony
02-12-2020T12:49:27,Roughlandin,Iron is good for you
02-12-2020T12:49:31,Roughlandin,;p

02-12-2020T12:50:29,Animexs,totinos?
02-12-2020T12:50:29,Roughlandin,School pizza was always a solid choice
02-12-2020T12:50:36,Folfy,my friend tried the school pizza with pineapple
02-12-2020T12:50:36,Roughlandin,Or pizza bagels
02-12-2020T12:50:38,Folfy,he got sick

02-12-2020T12:52:13,Roughlandin,Pizza is like sex. Even bad pizza is still pizza
02-12-2020T12:52:28,Folfy,Back in 1st grade I threw up pizza. Never really liked it since
02-12-2020T12:52:29,HuskyCookie,XD
02-12-2020T12:52:30,Roughlandin,...Glad Ord isn't here to smack me for that
02-12-2020T12:52:34,Folfy,ha
02-12-2020T12:52:36,MotoNeko,Bye Teapot! Have a great day
02-12-2020T12:52:44,Kiwipower,I hate school pizza because I can‚Äôt eat grease and it always had a inch thick layer of grease
02-12-2020T12:52:46,FreelancerAgentMaine,"School pizza was never horrible, but still the worst pizza ive had"
02-12-2020T12:53:03,Folfy,I haven't really ever tried the school pizza
02-12-2020T12:53:05,iliar,"I do not understand what is the reason why people do not like raw eggs. In my opinion, this is delicious. Especially when they are fresh and still warm."
02-12-2020T12:53:28,FreelancerAgentMaine,I threw up a little
02-12-2020T12:53:29,iliar,Although my parents swore at me when I drank raw eggs.
02-12-2020T12:53:34,FreelancerAgentMaine,Gross
02-12-2020T12:53:35,Folfy,hmm
02-12-2020T12:53:44,Twokinds,eugh
02-12-2020T12:53:44,Folfy,kinda like how my mom likes super runny eggs
02-12-2020T12:53:53,Twokinds,"I know some people do it, but I don't think I'd risk it"
02-12-2020T12:53:56,FreelancerAgentMaine,I dont like chugging slime
02-12-2020T12:54:01,Kiwipower,^
02-12-2020T12:54:04,Kiwipower,Same
02-12-2020T12:54:11,Fatigue,which version of photoshop does he use?
02-12-2020T12:54:13,Folfy,you ever heard of balut
02-12-2020T12:54:17,TheSexyBeast,.. because uncooked eggs equal salmonella. It has been drilled into our brains since childhood not to eat raw proteins.
02-12-2020T12:54:17,Roughlandin,"I'll go sunny side up on my eggs, but I'm not big on raw egg"
02-12-2020T12:54:30,Folfy,yeah I won't eat a raw egg
02-12-2020T12:54:38,Fatigue,"i eat raw eggs all the time, no salmonella"
02-12-2020T12:54:39,Twokinds,"The way eggs are prepared here, there's a risk. And I've had food poisoning twice. I never want it again."
02-12-2020T12:54:40,Folfy,but for some reason raw cookie dough
02-12-2020T12:54:48,NinoGD,oof
02-12-2020T12:54:48,Folfy,i will eat that
02-12-2020T12:54:51,Roughlandin,"Funnily enough, farm fresh eggs are actually safer"
02-12-2020T12:54:55,Folfy,true
02-12-2020T12:55:00,Fatigue,I use raw egg yolks in a lot of my food
02-12-2020T12:55:03,Folfy,because it doesn't go through processing.
02-12-2020T12:55:24,Roughlandin,"Store bought eggs are washed, which gets rid of the anti-bacterial coat they have over the shell"
02-12-2020T12:55:25,FreelancerAgentMaine,Because of my fear of getting food poisoning i always accidentally over cook chicken and pork
02-12-2020T12:55:38,Folfy,I always over cook pork

02-12-2020T12:56:06,Folfy,family be like no pork. As a Kid I asked why
02-12-2020T12:56:13,iliar,"Not equal. As you can see, I am still alive. Although yes, there is some risk. On the other hand, mayonnaise is also made from raw eggs and is not heat-treated."
02-12-2020T12:56:14,Folfy,then they showed me well worms and stuff
02-12-2020T12:56:17,Kiwipower,Ello rough

02-12-2020T13:04:35,FreelancerAgentMaine,I hate cucumbers but i love pickles. Except when they have the consistency of soft rubber. They gotta go *CRONCH*
02-12-2020T13:04:36,Roughlandin,I think the pickling process destroys whatever protein I'm allergic to
02-12-2020T13:04:47,Roughlandin,That's my only explanation
02-12-2020T13:04:48,Folfy,that's good
