25-04-2020T00:02:09,AspiringNoodle,I'm just so friggin' tired of so many things at my job
25-04-2020T00:02:40,AspiringNoodle,"Self serve up, lottery up.  All this work that needs to be done, and they demand be done, but not enough manpower to do it without a 7-hour cardio session."
25-04-2020T00:03:18,AspiringNoodle,"My one coworker is a super hard worker, and she puts way more effort into this job than I'm willing to.  She will work herself into a sweat getting stuff done."
25-04-2020T00:03:53,AspiringNoodle,But I have literally 0 incentive to reward this BS
25-04-2020T00:04:42,AspiringNoodle,"Because all that'll happen is, when the pandemic ends and they strip the extra work, they'll see that we were able to get our tasks ""done"" with the stripped hours, and reason that we can now get our old amount done with even less hours."
25-04-2020T00:07:15,AspiringNoodle,"I hate complaining this much, but I'm between a rock and a hard place."
25-04-2020T00:07:55,AspiringNoodle,"And even if I were to get laid off, I doubt I could collect unemployment.  I might not meet all the criteria.  Also that whole thing where there are so many claims coming in the whole system is locking up."
25-04-2020T00:09:21,AspiringNoodle,"Okay, enough of that, let's switch speed"
25-04-2020T00:10:21,RimaDraws,wooo

25-04-2020T00:14:12,AspiringNoodle,Huh... gonna backpedal a bit into the rant
25-04-2020T00:14:34,AspiringNoodle,Apparently it's not just Target.  Walmart and even Amazon employees are planning a mass call out on May 1st
25-04-2020T00:14:43,AspiringNoodle,This should be interesting. *grabs :popcorn:*

25-04-2020T00:15:19,AspiringNoodle,I get to witness the madness unfold! MWAHAHAHAHAHA!!!
25-04-2020T00:16:07,AspiringNoodle,"Rima, wanna place your bet?"
25-04-2020T00:16:16,AspiringNoodle,My money's on it making front-line news
25-04-2020T00:16:25,RimaDraws,nah i'm good
25-04-2020T00:21:18,AspiringNoodle,"That reminds me, had a pissed off customer, lol"
25-04-2020T00:21:49,AspiringNoodle,"It's almost 11, the store closed at 10, I'm there late because I decided to finish one more task, btw not doing that again, before closing or nothing."
25-04-2020T00:22:15,AspiringNoodle,"They're in front of the store, door's locked, lights at the pumps off, I'm finishing up closing out the register, phone starts ringing, I ignore it."
25-04-2020T00:22:26,AspiringNoodle,"When it stops ringing, I just hear a car angrily accelerating away"
25-04-2020T00:22:52,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-snicker:
25-04-2020T00:23:46,AspiringNoodle,"I don't care if they talk to a manager tomorrow, because they'll probably be on my side."
25-04-2020T00:31:14,CrRAR,Yeah seems good to keep with policy esp for your own safety that late.
25-04-2020T00:32:46,AspiringNoodle,"My logic is, ""If I didn't try finishing that one task, I probably would've been out of here a half-hour ago, and so you'd be calling an empty store"
25-04-2020T00:33:12,CrRAR,Pretty much
25-04-2020T00:35:00,AspiringNoodle,If anyone ever tries giving me shit for not finishing everything
25-04-2020T00:35:08,AspiringNoodle,I have the only response I'll ever need.
25-04-2020T00:35:53,AspiringNoodle,"""Check the cameras. I :clap: DON'T :clap: TAKE :clap: BREAKS :clap: """
25-04-2020T00:37:29,AspiringNoodle,"Feel free to criticize me for doing something wrong, I'll do it right in the future.  But I am constantly working these days."
25-04-2020T01:01:09,SpazztasticKiwi,it’d be nice if there was a pocket game I could play that could link with others on the computer
25-04-2020T01:02:09,SpazztasticKiwi,all they got is golf dead by daylight & raft
25-04-2020T01:02:38,SpazztasticKiwi,uno & monopoly would be cool against randos maybe but
25-04-2020T01:03:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d rather get something like don’t starve that you can dick around in
25-04-2020T01:03:34,AspiringNoodle,I think that game's on my bucketlist
25-04-2020T01:03:49,AspiringNoodle,"You can make custom models in that one, right?"
25-04-2020T01:04:03,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve never gotten to play

25-04-2020T02:00:11,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t drink
25-04-2020T02:00:47,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve been high strung for what may very well be years but let’s say for a few months

25-04-2020T20:01:41,ShamusTheFox,"What happens if the lamp is destroyed? Can Willow find another vessel, or does that effectively kill her?"
25-04-2020T20:01:41,TraceLegacyXI,i just confused myself really bad

25-04-2020T20:03:12,ShamusTheFox,Let's be fair. Keith was not the most likeable character at the start of the comic.
25-04-2020T20:03:17,Roughlandin,How can you not like the main character of the whole series?
25-04-2020T20:03:19,TraceLegacyXI,agreed
25-04-2020T20:03:22,Stormagedon,You right
25-04-2020T20:03:26,TraceLegacyXI,i dont hate him
25-04-2020T20:03:28,Stormagedon,he grew
25-04-2020T20:03:29,Ordithus,wasn't supposed to be
25-04-2020T20:03:35,TraceLegacyXI,but i certainly dont adore him

25-04-2020T20:04:33,TraceLegacyXI,red is kinds a jerk in literally every comic page he jas been in
25-04-2020T20:04:45,TraceLegacyXI,coincidence? i think not!

25-04-2020T21:08:58,KeefMcDerpface,bye Rough
25-04-2020T21:09:15,Ordithus,"night trace, night rough"
25-04-2020T21:10:56,Dadrobit,Daaaaaaamn..... I was trying to up my audio game while my internet was shit and found some surround sound plug-in shenaniganry to play around with.
25-04-2020T21:11:20,RimaDraws,oh no
25-04-2020T21:11:24,Dadrobit,"Alas, my version of Pro Tools does not include surround sound mixing."
25-04-2020T21:12:14,Dadrobit,Got my hopes up when I found RØDE dropped a huge library of free surround sound samples.
25-04-2020T21:13:07,Dadrobit,"Need the ""Ultimate"" version, but that's $80 a month."
25-04-2020T21:13:18,RimaDraws,yikes
25-04-2020T21:13:34,RimaDraws,wish i could afford photoshop but its $30 a month
25-04-2020T21:13:43,RimaDraws,i dont make that money
25-04-2020T21:13:48,Dadrobit,Flat out literally not worth it. I only spend $100 a year for my current version.
25-04-2020T21:14:17,Dadrobit,(That's after the initial $500 or so) Shit ain't cheap.
25-04-2020T21:14:21,RimaDraws,oh really
25-04-2020T21:14:52,Dadrobit,I dunno if they even offer the flat one time fee anymore?
25-04-2020T21:15:10,Twokinds,I hate subscription services
25-04-2020T21:15:13,Dadrobit,The $100 annual payment is just to keep the updates coming.
25-04-2020T21:15:18,Twokinds,For software
25-04-2020T21:15:22,Twokinds,I just wanna buy it
25-04-2020T21:15:46,Ordithus,"the version of PS you use is subscription, yeah?"
25-04-2020T21:15:50,Twokinds,Yep.
25-04-2020T21:15:54,Twokinds,It pains me to pay Adobe
25-04-2020T21:16:19,Twokinds,But it's the price of business.
25-04-2020T21:16:19,Dadrobit,"I agree, but I kinda understand if the developers are consistently updating their services. Still most software is way too expensive."
25-04-2020T21:16:21,Ordithus,glad there's enough free tools for photography
25-04-2020T21:16:32,Ordithus,even though adobe's stuff is some of the best...
25-04-2020T21:18:01,Dadrobit,"Just checked, Pro Tools does still offer a one time payment perpetual liscense. $599."
25-04-2020T21:18:19,Ordithus,ouchies
25-04-2020T21:18:26,Twokinds,That's pretty expensive alright
25-04-2020T21:18:28,BadFoMo,Try Gimp 2?
25-04-2020T21:18:43,Dadrobit,"Worth it. Also, tax deductible if you're in it for a business."
25-04-2020T21:19:05,BadFoMo,Dude! You're getting like $1000 form Patreon!
25-04-2020T21:19:11,BadFoMo,*from
25-04-2020T21:19:41,Dadrobit,The Ultimate version doesn't have a perpetual license alas. $800 per year.
25-04-2020T21:19:50,Dadrobit,fuuuucking nutty
25-04-2020T21:19:54,Twokinds,Holy moly
25-04-2020T21:20:03,Twokinds,Yar har
25-04-2020T21:20:10,Dadrobit,LMAO
25-04-2020T21:20:33,Dadrobit,It's legit only targeted at serious audio studios doing big league work.
25-04-2020T21:20:44,BadFoMo,"I don't really reckomend it, but... pirate it?"
25-04-2020T21:21:08,Dadrobit,I only want it for surround sound for shits n giggles. Not gonna even try.
25-04-2020T21:21:11,Twokinds,"I wanted to try and play around with a little animation, so I looked into Toon Boom, which seems to be the standard now."
25-04-2020T21:21:33,Twokinds,To buy Toon Boom Premium: $2035
25-04-2020T21:21:39,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I've heard of it."
25-04-2020T21:21:42,Dadrobit,Oh shi-
25-04-2020T21:21:51,Dadrobit,Annual or Perpetual?
25-04-2020T21:22:00,BadFoMo,...What @Dadrobit  said.
25-04-2020T21:22:08,Twokinds,That's their one time buy price
25-04-2020T21:22:15,KeefMcDerpface,pffftt
25-04-2020T21:22:38,SpazztasticKiwi,sweet baby Jesus that’s the price of a car
25-04-2020T21:22:50,KeefMcDerpface,yep
25-04-2020T21:22:53,Twokinds,It's almost the price of my whole drawing tablet.
25-04-2020T21:23:14,SpazztasticKiwi,that software better do my taxes and cook a meal too
25-04-2020T21:23:26,Twokinds,"But I guess you know, it's the cost of business."
25-04-2020T21:23:34,Dadrobit,"Blughhh... I'm all for supporting awesome software suites, (especially when they're tax deductible) but man is there a high bar to clear just to get in the door with some of this stuff."
25-04-2020T21:23:35,Ordithus,"well, if you really need it it will help buy you that meal"
25-04-2020T21:23:54,Ordithus,"would be nice if they had a ""get started"" package"
25-04-2020T21:23:54,Twokinds,It's a tool. Like an expensive instrument or building supplies or whatever
25-04-2020T21:24:07,Dadrobit,That's exactly it.
25-04-2020T21:24:30,Dadrobit,"Pro Tools actually has just that, Ord. Pro Tools First."
25-04-2020T21:24:36,SpazztasticKiwi,“cost of business” sounds like essay talk for overpriced for heavy profit
25-04-2020T21:24:37,Ordithus,ah
25-04-2020T21:24:44,Dadrobit,"Totally free, but stripped down a bit."
25-04-2020T21:24:54,Ordithus,well there ya go
25-04-2020T21:25:00,Twokinds,"They do have Toon Boom Essentials (""only "" $400) but they took out all the good stuff from it."
25-04-2020T21:25:26,SpazztasticKiwi,do you want a steak or the full cow
25-04-2020T21:25:29,Dadrobit,"I remember reading an article from a band, (can't remember who) who did their entire album on the free version."
25-04-2020T21:28:10,Dadrobit,"The regular version of PT is actually pretty completely comprehensive for real work thankfully. It's just missing stuff like surround sound, Dolby Atmos mixing, and some quality of life rendering techniques."
25-04-2020T21:28:22,w0lfmare,"I haven't had the chance to really look into it yet, but Opentoonz might be worth looking at Tom"
25-04-2020T21:29:15,w0lfmare,"Ghibli Studios has used it in the past, I've heard. So it must have something going for it"
25-04-2020T21:29:37,Dadrobit,That's a pretty decent endorsement I'd say.
25-04-2020T21:29:58,w0lfmare,"Oh correction: "" the open source version of the Toonz animation software used by Studio Ghibli"""
25-04-2020T21:30:05,Twokinds,I've looked at Opentoonz
25-04-2020T21:30:34,Twokinds,It's interface though looks a lot less like what I'm used to.
25-04-2020T21:31:14,Dadrobit,UI = Workflow baby.
25-04-2020T21:32:09,Twokinds,"Yeah... I want to play around and make animation, but a lot of open software tends to have janky ui that I end up fighting more than anything else."
25-04-2020T21:32:40,w0lfmare,"Do you think it's something you could get used to, or is it simply poor design?"
25-04-2020T21:32:53,Dadrobit,S'why I feel oddly stuck in PT. I've spent so many years operating the same hotkeys in the same environment. Trying other DAWs makes me feel slow and out of place. Even when I KNOW it's just me and not the tool.
25-04-2020T21:33:02,AspiringNoodle,The sad truth is that the expensive software is typically priced around studios buying it... same way with work stations
25-04-2020T21:33:18,AspiringNoodle,"Studios, they can easily eat that cost without a second thought"
25-04-2020T21:33:18,w0lfmare,"I'm curious about the software myself, and whether or not I should try it instead of continuing to use Clip"
25-04-2020T21:33:24,AspiringNoodle,Independents?  BIG decision...
25-04-2020T21:33:25,Ordithus,holy hell you don't want to know how much the software I use for work costs
25-04-2020T21:33:37,Dadrobit,Something CAD related?
25-04-2020T21:33:39,AspiringNoodle,Case in point for my argument?
25-04-2020T21:33:44,Ordithus,"yeah, engineering software"
25-04-2020T21:34:40,AspiringNoodle,"Photoshop, if you can get it for $10 a month, is roughly the same price if you bought the lastest CS versions every time they came out"
25-04-2020T21:34:40,Dadrobit,Like Reaper. Almost completely free DAW. I know tons of professionals use it. Even has surround sound baked in. Absolutely cannot get over the workflow differences.
25-04-2020T21:34:43,Ordithus,glad I don't pay for it... directly
25-04-2020T21:35:08,AspiringNoodle,"But if you only bought every other version or so, Adobe is getting more money out of you."
25-04-2020T21:35:59,AspiringNoodle,And the sad truth is that Photoshop is rather EOL when it comes to development.  They can't really revolutionize anymore.  There's only so many new tools you can make that are actually useful
25-04-2020T21:36:11,AspiringNoodle,There's only so many optimizations you can make for hardware now that it's power is exploding.
25-04-2020T21:36:17,johnnytho,Fusion 360?
25-04-2020T21:37:51,SpazztasticKiwi,oh yeah I got a new plant
25-04-2020T21:37:55,AspiringNoodle,"I've said it before, and I stick by it, I would GLADLY subscribe to Photoshop if Adobe had an option to keep the most recent version if you sub for so long"
25-04-2020T21:38:00,SpazztasticKiwi,"at this rate, I’ll run a greenhouse"
25-04-2020T21:38:29,AspiringNoodle,Do you have sunflowers?
25-04-2020T21:39:02,johnnytho,what plant?
25-04-2020T21:39:18,AspiringNoodle,"And yeah, I just hate that you HAVE to stay subscribed to Adobe or you lose access to the software..."
25-04-2020T21:39:39,SpazztasticKiwi,succulent
25-04-2020T21:39:40,HoverdudeXL,THERES AN ACTUAL APP TO WATCH THE STREAM ON XBOX
25-04-2020T21:39:44,HoverdudeXL,Wht
25-04-2020T21:39:47,HoverdudeXL,Wth
25-04-2020T21:39:48,johnnytho,nice
25-04-2020T21:39:53,AspiringNoodle,It's just a way for them to keep extracting money even if they're not exactly putting out updates that warrant what you're spending.
25-04-2020T21:40:04,HoverdudeXL,Is cool
25-04-2020T21:40:13,AspiringNoodle,Naisu
25-04-2020T22:08:14,SpazztasticKiwi,"google, how long until tomato seeds sprout"
25-04-2020T22:08:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"“6 days, 12 days, 2 weeks, 12 weeks”"
25-04-2020T22:08:45,SpazztasticKiwi,you don’t know - got it
25-04-2020T22:10:15,ZacariasBoi,"they sprout in around 10 days, however take months to fully grow"
25-04-2020T22:10:33,ZacariasBoi,this has been your unofficial picarto google search

25-04-2020T22:40:46,RimaDraws,i can dream that instead of these actual nightmares ive been having

25-04-2020T22:41:24,AspiringNoodle,"The fun part being that if you needed to, you COULD run out of the control room"
25-04-2020T22:42:39,FluffyDrawings,Oh no! I missed it. -w- oof
