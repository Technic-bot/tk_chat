31-03-2020T00:22:51,BlackjackSec99,"unrelated note... would be cool to see a detailed world map for TK... just thinking cause Im re-reading it (again) and Im at the part where trace and flora are making plans, looking at a map while they are on the Basitin islands, before the showdown..."
31-03-2020T00:23:07,BlackjackSec99,thought it might be neat to see. maybe Ill put it as a suggest.

31-03-2020T00:25:04,BlackjackSec99,is suddenly curious
31-03-2020T00:26:09,BadFoMo,"93. Sequel to Merfolk ( https://www.patreon.com/posts/merfolk-13811941 )! Merie Telling Flora and Trace that Merfolk reproduce like Seahorses. (Actual lore where Trace is sporting a bump, or is Merie simply messing with the two novice Merfolk?)"

31-03-2020T19:45:29,SpazztasticKiwi,he also invited me to drop by at any time cause his fiancé - who is pregnant - loves company
31-03-2020T19:45:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"she’s a friend I had in hs, though a grade above me"
31-03-2020T19:47:11,SpazztasticKiwi,I told him she doesn’t need company considering the ~epidemic~ going on and self isolation and he’s like “oh she’s got two of her little nieces over babysitting rn”
31-03-2020T19:48:58,SpazztasticKiwi,"alright fine, you get sick being immunocompromised and she get sick being pregnant"

31-03-2020T20:26:33,CrRAR,"haha, nice, I loved that sketch"
31-03-2020T20:26:58,CrRAR,very dramatic coloring
31-03-2020T20:40:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"if I heard right, there was a group of teen boys tossing around the idea of coughing on the food at the hot bar"
31-03-2020T20:40:15,SpazztasticKiwi,"boy, try me - I light up"
31-03-2020T20:40:48,IronHorseComics,damn teenagers
31-03-2020T20:40:56,IronHorseComics,always the dumbest things in creation
31-03-2020T20:41:20,IronHorseComics,"check that, stupidest in creation, because dumb implies they don't know any better"
31-03-2020T20:47:15,SpazztasticKiwi,"speaking of kids, there’s a group out rn on bikes"
31-03-2020T20:47:17,SpazztasticKiwi,at night
31-03-2020T20:47:20,SpazztasticKiwi,no lights
31-03-2020T20:54:21,tobygranger,I'm 15 and the only time I ride my bike is to collect bottles
31-03-2020T20:57:15,BlackjackSec99,"man, I used to ride 60-80 miles a day 6 days a week this time of year... then again, small town, not much else to do."
31-03-2020T20:58:18,BlackjackSec99,"now though, I would probably have a heart attack after 10 miles lol"
31-03-2020T21:00:58,tobygranger,I can't go out because of Quarantine lol
31-03-2020T21:05:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"if anyone is here that knows who the pokemon cake lady is, she came by again today"
31-03-2020T21:06:26,CrRAR,"I remember the cake lady, she left dissatisfied again I take it?"
31-03-2020T21:07:03,SpazztasticKiwi,no they finally herded that gaggle of geese
31-03-2020T21:07:22,SpazztasticKiwi,she has another two cakes she ordered after for the future
31-03-2020T21:07:46,SpazztasticKiwi,"she wanted to change the date for one, but this was the first time I’d seen her kids"
31-03-2020T21:07:59,CrRAR,lol
31-03-2020T21:08:02,SpazztasticKiwi,twin boys and an older girl
31-03-2020T21:08:25,tobygranger,I only really know gen 1
31-03-2020T21:08:49,CrRAR,What cakes did she settle on?
31-03-2020T21:09:02,SpazztasticKiwi,"they seemed well behaved, she made it sound like they were ones that went nuclear if something didn’t go their way, which was the whole reason why she kept on us about changing the cake design even though it went against copyright"
31-03-2020T21:09:43,SpazztasticKiwi,"I don’t know anything about these cakes and if God has a heart, I’ll never see her again"
31-03-2020T21:10:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I dealt with her only a handful of times but I know what hell she put my managers through those weeks she was coming in every day and I’m sorry but not sorry but I knew two
31-03-2020T21:10:50,SpazztasticKiwi,of those kids had to be twins cause I couldn’t imagine the poor sap that got it up for her twice
31-03-2020T21:12:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"but lo and behold unless she was babysitting, she’s got 3"
31-03-2020T21:12:15,CrRAR,hahaha
31-03-2020T21:12:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I will cry if I don’t get my July holiday

31-03-2020T21:25:23,tobygranger,but are the borders closed in America
