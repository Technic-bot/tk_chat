10-10-2020T17:15:40,vevans0009,Luv the recording feature
10-10-2020T17:15:40,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,^
10-10-2020T17:15:46,MuonNeutrino,rose was born in 454. TDM was 5 or 6 years before present in 476-7
10-10-2020T17:16:18,ProsePro7,What is TDM?
10-10-2020T17:16:24,Ordithus,dragon masquerade

10-10-2020T17:16:28,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,DanTDM?
10-10-2020T17:16:30,Roughlandin,What Ord said
10-10-2020T17:16:33,MuonNeutrino,"according to her ref sheet rose was 9 in the flashbacks, so they took place in 463"
10-10-2020T17:16:43,RimaDraws,yea
10-10-2020T17:16:53,ProsePro7,Ah...the timeline still dont make since.  How old was Saria when she rescued Rose?
10-10-2020T17:17:14,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,Her age was a g e
10-10-2020T17:17:16,Roughlandin,18 right? She was 22 when she married Trace?
10-10-2020T17:17:32,vevans0009,"Remember, Keidran age quicker"
10-10-2020T17:17:39,Ordithus,she was probably a rebellious teenager
10-10-2020T17:17:42,ProsePro7,So Rose was captive for what 17 years?  Cause Trace was a boy when she was captured
10-10-2020T17:17:42,K3IDRAN,Yep
10-10-2020T17:17:49,RimaDraws,she was brash toward boys from what i saw in roses ref
10-10-2020T17:17:54,Brocade,do keidran have faster metabolisms?

10-10-2020T17:18:08,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,Yeah. @Twokinds the currently playing is broken
10-10-2020T17:18:14,MuonNeutrino,"saria's gravestone says 449-477, so saria was sometime in her teens when she rescued rose"
10-10-2020T17:18:17,Twokinds,No it's not
10-10-2020T17:18:22,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,"Oh, ok"
10-10-2020T17:18:25,Twokinds,It's all Kurzgesagt Soundtrack
10-10-2020T17:18:36,Ordithus,several years older than Trace
10-10-2020T17:18:37,NezumiYuki,Average life expectancy for Keidran is 20yr correct?
10-10-2020T17:18:45,Roughlandin,"lol, Tom"
10-10-2020T17:18:52,MuonNeutrino,"supposedly, though perhaps slightly longer"
10-10-2020T17:18:54,MuonNeutrino,in some cases anyway
10-10-2020T17:19:10,MuonNeutrino,rose died at 26
10-10-2020T17:19:17,steelabjur,"Here's a question, how old was Zen in TDM? Because he's like two years older than Flora, and we saw Flora- as a child- when Saria and Trace went to their cabin in the woods and Saria died."
10-10-2020T17:19:28,vevans0009,Current Trace wants Flora to live as much he does I bet.
10-10-2020T17:20:05,Brocade,hearthrob pls
10-10-2020T17:20:30,Roughlandin,"Nora listening to this time discussion like, ""I don't know how you people age! I go away for a day and you all look older to me!"""
10-10-2020T17:20:33,ProsePro7,But what I am saying is Saria and Trace are roughly the same age so how long was Rose a captive?
10-10-2020T17:20:40,sub2samuele,Hello
10-10-2020T17:20:49,Roughlandin,o/ sam
10-10-2020T17:20:52,MuonNeutrino,saria and trace are NOT the same age
10-10-2020T17:20:59,MuonNeutrino,saria was significantly older than trace
10-10-2020T17:21:11,Twokinds,Saria is much older than Trace.
10-10-2020T17:21:11,ProsePro7,...?   Where does that come from?
10-10-2020T17:21:17,Ordithus,Like 10 years ish
10-10-2020T17:21:23,Twokinds,She even says in TDM that Trace is too young for her.
10-10-2020T17:21:23,vevans0009,Trace barely was a adult
10-10-2020T17:21:27,Ordithus,Trace is just now 24
10-10-2020T17:21:27,MuonNeutrino,"saria was born in 449, trace was born in 458"
10-10-2020T17:21:44,MuonNeutrino,so trace is 9 years younger than her
10-10-2020T17:21:45,ProsePro7,Like I said looking for a reference
10-10-2020T17:21:50,Roughlandin,Trace was ambitious in all things
10-10-2020T17:22:05,MuonNeutrino,"saria's birthdate is on her tombstone in ch6, trace's age is in the character page"
10-10-2020T17:22:11,vevans0009,Yus
10-10-2020T17:22:25,KeefMcDerpface,:eyes:

10-10-2020T17:23:07,CrimsonQuill,"What I wonder about in TDM is that Zen and Nat are adults, but in chapter 7 Natani mentioned Trace killing their family../"

10-10-2020T17:23:10,MuonNeutrino,*guru
10-10-2020T17:23:15,MuonNeutrino,i have *spreadsheets* for this XD
10-10-2020T17:23:18,Twokinds,There's only one calendar.
10-10-2020T17:23:23,RimaDraws,yea
10-10-2020T17:23:24,CrimsonQuill,Although that might just be early installment wierdness
10-10-2020T17:23:29,vevans0009,I keep saying Trace has a thing for certain women
10-10-2020T17:23:32,ProsePro7,So everyone uses the same calendar?...thats boring

10-10-2020T17:24:40,Paxpup,Also! Did someone say boobs?!   ....not that it interests me or anything....
10-10-2020T17:24:43,ProsePro7,Well glad to see that after pestering Tom for like two years he finally explained things
10-10-2020T17:25:02,vevans0009,I am just waiting for the TK Lore Book
10-10-2020T17:25:11,ProsePro7,@MuonNeutrino appreciate the timeline explanation though
10-10-2020T17:25:15,Roughlandin,"Eh, it's all wibbly wobbly, timey wimey, anyway"
10-10-2020T17:25:16,Brocade,"yes, paxpup - it's one of the sketch ideas"
10-10-2020T17:25:27,steelabjur,Saria and Trace reminds me of myself and my gf (only we're 6 years apart).
10-10-2020T17:25:29,Paxpup,Ooh~
10-10-2020T17:25:30,ProsePro7,@vevans0009 I would write it if Tom would let me
10-10-2020T17:25:38,MuonNeutrino,"saria was born in 449. rose was born in 454 and was 9 during the flashbacks. this is likely to take place sometime within a couple years after those flashbacks, which would make saria in her mid to late teens"
10-10-2020T17:25:44,MuonNeutrino,and rose like 10-11
10-10-2020T17:25:58,vevans0009,Pretty much
10-10-2020T17:26:15,Roughlandin,"For everyone's sake, we'll say Saria was 18 during this sketch series"
10-10-2020T17:26:21,Ordithus,Trace and Saria were not together long
10-10-2020T17:26:30,MuonNeutrino,"TDM took place in either 476 or 477, which is at least a decade after the likely time this sketch took place"
10-10-2020T17:26:33,Ordithus,Barely met before marriage
10-10-2020T17:26:43,Ordithus,And then she died :ctwokinds-LauraCry:
10-10-2020T17:26:52,CrRAR,"yeah, Nora described it as moving quickly"
10-10-2020T17:26:53,MuonNeutrino,so tl;dr saria and rose lived together for at least 10-12 years before trace came on the scene
10-10-2020T17:27:04,vevans0009,Trace sure try his damnest to woo her
10-10-2020T17:27:05,Roughlandin,Then Trace cried. Then LOTS MORE other people died
10-10-2020T17:27:09,ProsePro7,The explanations in comic are just a little vague for me I had thought that the Basitan calendar was different than the human one or else I would have probably caught on sooner
10-10-2020T17:27:20,MuonNeutrino,they're too close for it to be coincidence
10-10-2020T17:27:37,MuonNeutrino,that the death year on saria's stone is so close to the year on maddie's letter
10-10-2020T17:27:50,ProsePro7,I'll allow it.  No objections

10-10-2020T22:10:22,unsteddyphoenix,a bit surprised ya let that one through

10-10-2020T22:13:49,Dadrobit,Depends on the slashfic you're reading I s'pose.
10-10-2020T22:14:17,Dadrobit,Natani's heat is kinda unique. Natani is doing everything in their power to deny it.
10-10-2020T22:14:33,Dadrobit,Compared to Flora who just kinda went with it if memory serves.

10-10-2020T22:18:01,Dadrobit,Ended up lowering her to the point of accepting Ephemural
10-10-2020T22:19:23,Dadrobit,The boinking happened just slightly later
10-10-2020T22:19:59,Ordithus,"it didn't help that, but there was plenty of other things getting her down, too. Saria's presence was a complication"
10-10-2020T22:20:23,Dadrobit,"Yeah, the heat was actually finished by the time she completely succumbed."
10-10-2020T22:20:48,AspiringNoodle,I should really reread the entire comic at this point :|
10-10-2020T22:21:01,AspiringNoodle,So many details near the beginning that I've forgotten
10-10-2020T22:21:39,AspiringNoodle,"Also, finally watching the Phasmophobia vids.  Omfg, Markimoo's death scream towards the end on Shawn's end xD"
10-10-2020T22:21:46,Dadrobit,"The beginning is kind of a ""everything happens super quick"" mess."
10-10-2020T22:22:14,AspiringNoodle,Also lots of little details that are later either forgotten about or retconned

10-10-2020T22:23:00,AspiringNoodle,"Bleh, sorry, I know that's the right spelling :("

10-10-2020T22:24:42,SpazztasticKiwi,so how was the pumpkin carving  Nibbly received
10-10-2020T22:25:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I have 3 weeks and 3 other options to try

10-10-2020T22:26:07,SpazztasticKiwi,does that mean I should try again
10-10-2020T22:26:29,SpazztasticKiwi,because that means not trying one of my other halloween themes
10-10-2020T22:26:47,Ordithus,do what you want
10-10-2020T22:27:09,SpazztasticKiwi,"well trace and Purrrsephone didn‚Äôt do well anyway to retry, come to think of it"

10-10-2020T22:41:51,SpazztasticKiwi,ok maybe the rodrick one is more of a story but still

10-10-2020T22:47:33,SpazztasticKiwi,because it was his boat and he died or went missing after letting them off
