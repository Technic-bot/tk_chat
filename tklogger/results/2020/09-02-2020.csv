09-02-2020T00:14:18,JojoF2415,HI 100% practice mode 365 attempts
09-02-2020T00:25:18,AspiringNoodle,*yawn* so tired
09-02-2020T00:25:23,AspiringNoodle,But so much weekly stuff to finish...
09-02-2020T00:30:09,AspiringNoodle,*remembers Fluff is streming*
09-02-2020T00:30:11,AspiringNoodle,*pops in*

09-02-2020T00:30:23,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-uneasy:
09-02-2020T00:30:40,AspiringNoodle,Dang that looks good... *inspiration intensifies*
09-02-2020T00:52:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"Tom, if Maddie flips when someone shows ankleness, what would she do if someone broke the 4th wall a bit and snatched her line art"
09-02-2020T01:02:11,AspiringNoodle,Her head would probably 'splode
09-02-2020T01:26:13,SpazztasticKiwi,üõå
09-02-2020T01:26:41,AspiringNoodle,*anxiety sinks in*
09-02-2020T01:26:49,AspiringNoodle,*also some inspiration*
09-02-2020T01:32:23,AspiringNoodle,I'm curious... what does Fluff use to make his art?
09-02-2020T01:32:47,KeefMcDerpface,I just had the scariest thing happen to me just now.
09-02-2020T01:33:37,KeefMcDerpface,"My phone (Samsung S6) went blue screen with ""Downloading ... do not turn off target."""
09-02-2020T01:33:51,KeefMcDerpface,And I thought it was hacked.
09-02-2020T01:34:21,KeefMcDerpface,"Did a quick search, turns out it was a software glitch."
09-02-2020T01:34:44,KeefMcDerpface,Had to do a hard restart to fix it.
09-02-2020T01:35:59,KeefMcDerpface,I really need to upgrade.
09-02-2020T01:39:15,AspiringNoodle,I have an S6 Edge Plus
09-02-2020T01:39:27,AspiringNoodle,"I've had the screen go all rainbow on me in the past if I leave it on for too many days in a row, lol"
09-02-2020T01:43:18,KeefMcDerpface,"Ah, so is that what happened for me?"
09-02-2020T01:44:56,KeefMcDerpface,Guess I should make it a habit of turning off the phone to prevent that.
09-02-2020T01:56:44,AspiringNoodle,Dunno
09-02-2020T01:56:55,AspiringNoodle,"If you restart it every once in a while, it should be no problem"
09-02-2020T01:57:08,AspiringNoodle,We're talking I probably have let it go for at least a month before that happens
09-02-2020T01:57:25,KeefMcDerpface,Yeah
09-02-2020T01:57:43,KeefMcDerpface,Got the phone back when I was in school.
09-02-2020T01:58:02,KeefMcDerpface,So I had to turn it off before class.
09-02-2020T01:58:48,KeefMcDerpface,"Now that I'm out of school, I don't turn it off often."
09-02-2020T01:59:08,KeefMcDerpface,And this is the first time it has happened to me.
09-02-2020T01:59:49,KeefMcDerpface,So I guess turning it off resets whatever it was that caused this.
09-02-2020T02:16:59,KeefMcDerpface,"Well I'm going to bed, for read this time. Night all."
09-02-2020T02:45:32,DarthRexKing,see you all later.
09-02-2020T02:46:17,AspiringNoodle,Any night owls still among us?
