21-05-2020T20:09:20,hyneria,I remember it from a while ago
21-05-2020T20:09:23,SageSaga,Full color Nyna picture-
21-05-2020T20:09:50,SageSaga,and start on Full Color Michelle in an apron (only)

21-05-2020T20:11:06,Rosscoe,That sounds like something Michelle might do
21-05-2020T20:11:45,Chalodraws,:cchalodraws-MoraPicarto_Hi:

21-05-2020T20:15:23,unsteddyphoenix,hi
21-05-2020T20:15:39,Mihari,"Yah, I would say a bit too thick personally, but you take what you can get. XD"
21-05-2020T20:16:11,SageSaga,i would only be upset if Ron was the one who drew it
21-05-2020T20:16:21,SageSaga,:P
21-05-2020T20:16:21,BadFoMo,@Nekonny What are you doing?
21-05-2020T20:16:22,Mihari,"Yah, same, but he knows better XD"
21-05-2020T20:16:26,unsteddyphoenix,He wasnt?
21-05-2020T20:16:33,Rosscoe,"Just got caught up on Superi gallery on FA, still thicc girls all around ^.^"
21-05-2020T20:16:55,SageSaga,im not familiar with the artist but yeah def not Rons
21-05-2020T20:16:55,Mihari,"For some artists, it's all they do."
21-05-2020T20:17:13,Rosscoe,Everyone has a speaciality
21-05-2020T20:17:16,BadFoMo,It looked a little like texturing a 3D model.
21-05-2020T20:17:31,SageSaga,uhh
21-05-2020T20:17:41,SageSaga,not... really
21-05-2020T20:17:54,Bralios,I heard aprons. o.o
21-05-2020T20:18:14,unsteddyphoenix,You gotta have variety
21-05-2020T20:18:47,Tharkis,*insert furiously cooking lion sounds*
21-05-2020T20:18:49,Grip,hi
21-05-2020T20:18:57,BadFoMo,Yo.
21-05-2020T20:19:07,Tharkis,bralios summoned by the mere mention of kitchen /chef gear
21-05-2020T20:19:11,SageSaga,yo Grip
21-05-2020T20:19:17,Nekonny,"I got some giftart today of Kimi, wanted to have another go at that animation program"
21-05-2020T20:19:54,Nekonny,"Once you get used to it , it can be fast I think"
21-05-2020T20:20:00,Rainelover,"Oh wow, that is a nice bust from nekonny :flushed:"
21-05-2020T20:20:08,Nekonny,but I needed to get a better workflow
21-05-2020T20:20:22,Bralios,I gotta go grocery shopping.
21-05-2020T20:20:24,Tharkis,its' used by a number of indie game studios for their 2d animation sprites and stuff
21-05-2020T20:20:25,Nekonny,"the art isn't mine, although I had to make some heavy edits"
21-05-2020T20:20:28,Bralios,Took a day off for back pain. x.x
21-05-2020T20:20:32,Nekonny,and split it apart
21-05-2020T20:20:44,Bralios,So I guess I'll pick up something fancy for dinner/breakfast.
21-05-2020T20:20:54,Rainelover,"Ah, ok, still pretty good though!"
21-05-2020T20:20:55,BadFoMo,"@Nekonny Ah, so the polygons are sort of like the 'Puppet Tool' in Photoshop?"
21-05-2020T20:21:25,Tharkis,i tried butterball pre-cooked (brown and serve) turkey breakfast sausage patties (60% less fat!) and was very disappointed =(
21-05-2020T20:21:26,Bralios,"... And Tharkis is correct, I got a soft spot for aprons. They're cute."
21-05-2020T20:21:43,Bralios,"Well yeah. They're 60% less flavor. I bet it was low-sodium, too."
21-05-2020T20:21:44,Tharkis,grocery store near me didnt have any non-frozen breakf ast sausage today and mny freezer is full
21-05-2020T20:22:01,Tharkis,"i figured with as heavily spiced as breakfast sausages are, that i'd give th em a try"
21-05-2020T20:22:07,hyneria,animation always amazes me. I just can't grasp how artists like Nekonny figure out how the motion should work
21-05-2020T20:22:11,Tharkis,"it's not that they didnt tates ok, taste wise they werent bad"
21-05-2020T20:22:24,Tharkis,"but they were dry , and had an odd mouth feel"
21-05-2020T20:22:41,Tharkis,"and were generally unappetizing, despite tasting not bad"
21-05-2020T20:22:55,Bralios,"I'd imagine pre-cooked but not browned is steamed. Having less fat, they'll also need less filler to keep it together."
21-05-2020T20:22:56,Tharkis,probably would have been fine if i chopped them up and used them in an omlette or something
21-05-2020T20:23:19,zombiegamer,Hey Chalo
21-05-2020T20:23:20,Rosscoe,Health choice's some time's are flavorless
21-05-2020T20:23:37,Rosscoe,that or.........they use stuff they shouldnt be using as filler o.o
21-05-2020T20:23:59,Bralios,Spices are effectively no calories or salt. You can do quite a bit with little salt and butter.
21-05-2020T20:24:04,Tharkis,'breakfast sausage' is a very specific spice profile / flavor  in my head
21-05-2020T20:24:10,Bralios,Yeah.
21-05-2020T20:24:22,hyneria,Nekonny's animations look different from Sage's bouncy one tho.
21-05-2020T20:24:23,Rosscoe,I do my best too avoid salt useage
21-05-2020T20:24:24,Bralios,"Garlic, chili pepper, and salt come to mind for sure."
21-05-2020T20:24:32,Tharkis,"there are plenty of other sausages you can have at breakfast, but only one type is THE breakfast sausage lol"
21-05-2020T20:24:56,Bralios,Yeah. I get what you're saying.
21-05-2020T20:25:20,Bralios,Filler is pretty easy for breakfast sausage anyhow; just add breadcrumb.
21-05-2020T20:25:42,Mihari,"Well, Sage's is old school frame by frame animation, where as Nekonny's are generated by manipulating anchor points and simulated 3D."
21-05-2020T20:26:23,unsteddyphoenix,she has a monoboob
21-05-2020T20:26:32,Rosscoe,@Sage Nyna looking sexy o.o
21-05-2020T20:26:57,CrRAR,sounds efficient
21-05-2020T20:27:33,hyneria,I see
21-05-2020T20:27:34,Nekonny,it's used in a lot of games these days
21-05-2020T20:27:44,Nekonny,one you may know is dragons crown
21-05-2020T20:28:07,BadFoMo,Never heard of it.
21-05-2020T20:28:13,Mihari,Sadly Nekonny's program is limited in lots of ways. Otherwise it's pretty solid at what it does.
21-05-2020T20:28:25,hyneria,ooh
21-05-2020T20:28:31,hyneria,Caribbean Blue game when?
21-05-2020T20:28:36,Rosscoe,XD
21-05-2020T20:28:39,Rosscoe,That be cool
21-05-2020T20:28:43,SageSaga,isnt the one hes using a lot better?
21-05-2020T20:28:51,Mihari,Yes.
21-05-2020T20:28:53,Tharkis,after Ron wins powerball and can hire a team
21-05-2020T20:29:15,Bralios,Her poor back. :c
21-05-2020T20:29:20,hyneria,what would be the best genre tho? I'm gonna say VN
21-05-2020T20:29:41,unsteddyphoenix,fighting game
21-05-2020T20:29:42,SageSaga,"is it weird that a lot of times when i think ""Man if i won the lotto- i'd commission so many friends""? XD"
21-05-2020T20:29:47,Mihari,"Retelling CB as a VN would be fun, could have different endings, including the original ending Ron had planned XD"
21-05-2020T20:30:08,SageSaga,BAD END
21-05-2020T20:30:12,Mihari,I know right? XD
21-05-2020T20:30:17,hyneria,there was an alternate end?
21-05-2020T20:30:21,Mihari,Oh yes indeed.
21-05-2020T20:30:33,Tharkis,"harem ending, all the islands cats come home with them, mika, muna, etc."
21-05-2020T20:30:34,hyneria,maybe one where Maya wins and the world ends? :P
21-05-2020T20:30:47,unsteddyphoenix,"harem end, but straight up cats"
21-05-2020T20:30:48,Tharkis,"can play the pick a waifu game, and change the outcome, etc"
21-05-2020T20:30:59,Mihari,"Well, no in no ending did Maya win, but Kimi did die."
21-05-2020T20:31:06,Nekonny,It wold have been an emotional ending!
21-05-2020T20:31:15,Tharkis,:ctharkis-ewok:

21-05-2020T21:52:58,SageSaga,less overlapping and less softbody animation requirements

21-05-2020T21:54:04,Mihari,"Well ideally this kinda work should be done with doing the pieces independently from the start, not breaking up an existing image XD"

21-05-2020T21:54:52,SageSaga,its limited animation but it can still look really nice
21-05-2020T21:54:58,NezumiYuki,Breaking up an image is basically an Animator pulling some Reverse Engineering...   Not the best.. but does in a pinch for certain projects*
21-05-2020T21:55:03,TraceLegacyXI,I’ve been playing way too much Minecraft

21-05-2020T21:55:37,TraceLegacyXI,There’s no such thing as too much Minecraft

21-05-2020T21:57:00,SageSaga,and the camera- isnt?
21-05-2020T21:57:03,Mihari,"I'd except the first, the second is stupid excuse."
21-05-2020T21:57:09,Mihari,accept*
21-05-2020T21:57:29,Nekonny,camera is fixed?
21-05-2020T21:57:32,SageSaga,attach camera to breast movement- and it might look like shes on a boat XD
21-05-2020T22:00:20,Ordithus,alright Mike's smile is crazy cute
21-05-2020T22:00:38,SageSaga,actually- playing with camera motion on an animation like that would probably add a lot

21-05-2020T22:47:00,ArkanaCat,nora admitted itt was only an illusion. a powerful one. but illusion still
21-05-2020T22:47:11,Tharkis,then all you have to do is not ask those questions and you can enjoy your headcanon =D   Otherwise it ends up like the people who complain whenever jk rowling answers a question about potterverse
21-05-2020T22:47:14,Tharkis,and they dont like the answer
21-05-2020T22:47:19,dookaworld,Then again if the illusion could pass through solid matter then with a thin wall Mike could have wall ghost titties
21-05-2020T22:47:29,Rainelover,"I think that she made him physically a woman, considering what she said when she changed him in dragon masquerade"

21-05-2020T22:49:23,InTheLionsDen,She can probably do both the illusion and the physical change but for quick fun the illusion is probably a lot easier and requires a lot less energy to do.
21-05-2020T22:49:30,Ordithus,"a very good illusion.  If she can fool senses, she can fool fabric"

21-05-2020T23:29:00,Sclimshady,Monkees however
21-05-2020T23:29:03,Ordithus,yes there was an entire sequence of that!

21-05-2020T23:32:57,ShamusTheFox,First comic of Twokinds I saw was the fight between Natani and Keith in the Basitin village.
21-05-2020T23:32:59,Dadrobit,Cuz evil likes their suits and their leather. Both very easy to make sexy.
21-05-2020T23:33:20,Ordithus,Clovis wears neither tho

21-05-2020T23:55:43,AspiringNoodle,Sociopaths are characterized by a lack of impulse control and a tendency to commit crimes and not caring about the consequences or the people they harm.  Though they *do* care about family members.  They will also tend to shift any blame away from themsel
