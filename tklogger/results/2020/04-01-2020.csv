04-01-2020T03:46:36,AspiringNoodle,Man... I'm hungry... what should I eat...

04-01-2020T03:47:04,AspiringNoodle,Eh... guess I'll just keep playing OW and watching Youtube...
04-01-2020T03:48:59,AspiringNoodle,Also: Can we make it a law that legitimate idiots / a-hats are forced to wear dunce caps in public?

04-01-2020T08:47:43,JojoF2415,I’m going to redraw my kathrin fan art in a piece of paper than a sketchbook. I was so satisfied with the result. She is my favorite character and the one I’ve drawn the most.

04-01-2020T14:08:38,Twokinds,I have a feeling today's stream is going to go terribly XD
04-01-2020T14:08:51,Twokinds,I got 2 hours of sleep last night. I'm the walking dead right now.
04-01-2020T14:10:17,iliar,"Clear. If Tom suddenly stopped drawing for a long time during the stream, then he probably fell asleep on the tablet."
04-01-2020T14:12:25,RimaDraws,i feel ya tom i had 3 hours
04-01-2020T14:12:29,TeapotOfDoom,hi everybody
04-01-2020T14:12:36,TheFreindlyDeathclaw,Hi Teapot
04-01-2020T14:13:18,TeapotOfDoom,oh i know that state xD take your time tom. coffee might help :ctwokinds-kingtea:
04-01-2020T14:17:04,Twokinds,I'm going to try taking a nap. If the stream doesn't start... uh... I didn't wake up.
04-01-2020T14:17:29,TheFreindlyDeathclaw,have a good nap Tom
04-01-2020T14:17:30,TeapotOfDoom,sleep well

04-01-2020T14:18:13,iliar,"Not a problem, Tom. I think nothing bad will happen if you oversleep the stream."
04-01-2020T14:24:09,FloofyCat,"Fair, I should nap too x_x"
04-01-2020T14:24:37,RimaDraws,i should but i got things to do
04-01-2020T14:33:56,Zakuru,poor guy
04-01-2020T14:37:39,SpazztasticKiwi,aw Tom
04-01-2020T14:38:19,SpazztasticKiwi,"“I didn’t wake up” - so if he doesn’t return, he died"
04-01-2020T14:39:30,RimaDraws,no he is not going to die kiwi
04-01-2020T14:39:36,RimaDraws,he just needs some sleep
04-01-2020T14:46:40,Zakuru,so relatable
04-01-2020T14:46:47,Zakuru,"i read that as ""it is what it is ;w;"""
04-01-2020T14:47:12,RimaDraws,happens sometimes

04-01-2020T14:49:25,CrimsonQuill,Scrolled up through the chat
04-01-2020T14:49:35,CrimsonQuill,"I hope Tom enjoys his catnap, he probably needs it."

04-01-2020T14:58:20,CrimsonQuill,Time to make my sandwiches for tomorrow

04-01-2020T15:11:36,CrimsonQuill,"blegh, tired"
04-01-2020T15:12:36,RimaDraws,same bro
04-01-2020T15:18:13,AspiringNoodle,"same, because what is sleep schedule? xD"
04-01-2020T15:18:17,AspiringNoodle,Just woke up a half hour ago
04-01-2020T15:19:13,AspiringNoodle,so excited for strem :ptv-excited:
04-01-2020T15:20:17,CrimsonQuill,"@AspiringNoodle You might have to wait, Tom needed to take a nap"
04-01-2020T15:20:29,CrimsonQuill,And I'll probably miss it. I need a decent night's sleep for tomorrow.
04-01-2020T15:24:50,AspiringNoodle,Works for me~
04-01-2020T15:25:07,AspiringNoodle,Once the stream starts I kinda have a hard time doing other things ._.
04-01-2020T15:25:18,CrimsonQuill,Well
04-01-2020T15:25:24,AspiringNoodle,Cue me wishing for another monitor and a bigger table / room. :ptv-snicker:
04-01-2020T15:25:27,TeapotOfDoom,ima use the time to go over stuff for tuesday again+
04-01-2020T15:26:21,CrimsonQuill,"My plan for tonight is shower, maybe see the start of the stream, read a bit of TK in bed, sleep, wake up next morning, shower, dressed, head to campus, study exam."
04-01-2020T15:26:34,TeapotOfDoom,I'm curious
04-01-2020T15:26:43,TeapotOfDoom,how often have you read tk by now?
04-01-2020T15:26:53,CrimsonQuill,I'd say probably about seven times.
04-01-2020T15:26:59,CrimsonQuill,But this time is really special for me
04-01-2020T15:27:07,CrimsonQuill,It's ushering in the new decade
04-01-2020T15:27:22,CrimsonQuill,And marking my transition from one person into another (I hope)
04-01-2020T15:27:28,AspiringNoodle,I want to reread the comic
04-01-2020T15:27:53,CrimsonQuill,Plus I just love the chapters when Tom found his stride and stuck with it
04-01-2020T15:27:54,AspiringNoodle,I found where I stopped (it was the attack on the town and where Brutus gets b-slapped by Reni)
04-01-2020T15:28:06,AspiringNoodle,Which chapter was that? :D
04-01-2020T15:28:13,CrimsonQuill,"18-""Coming Home"""
04-01-2020T15:28:27,CrimsonQuill,One heck of a megaton punch.
04-01-2020T15:29:01,TeapotOfDoom,by now i think you're able to name every single panel from every single page
04-01-2020T15:29:37,CrimsonQuill,Not really
04-01-2020T15:29:42,CrimsonQuill,I'm not at that stage yet
04-01-2020T15:29:53,TeapotOfDoom,u sure?
04-01-2020T15:30:02,CrimsonQuill,But I've reread Calvin and Hobbes so often that I can recall most strips and stories from memory.
04-01-2020T15:30:04,TeapotOfDoom,i'm really tempted to try tho
04-01-2020T15:30:38,CrimsonQuill,"After this exam, though, I can REALLY get off my arse and do some drawing."
04-01-2020T15:31:17,CrimsonQuill,I should probably limit my Youtube and Videogame time....
04-01-2020T15:31:28,CrimsonQuill,Otherwise my fancomic ain't happenin'
04-01-2020T15:31:50,TeapotOfDoom,mmmm
04-01-2020T15:31:54,AspiringNoodle,"Same here, lol"
04-01-2020T15:32:08,AspiringNoodle,I'm tempted to play Overwatch a lot.  And I'm still trying to limit my youtubes
04-01-2020T15:32:22,AspiringNoodle,Overwatch is particularly egregious simply because of the long wait times
04-01-2020T15:32:27,TeapotOfDoom,"i know that. watching to much unexpectables, distracts me from learning. i'm keeping it together quite well but my life would be a lot less stressfull"
04-01-2020T15:32:33,CrimsonQuill,Halo Reach PC for me is my bane
04-01-2020T15:32:35,CrimsonQuill,And Minecraft
04-01-2020T15:32:40,CrimsonQuill,And Space Marine
04-01-2020T15:32:55,AspiringNoodle,I've gotten a lot better at WoW.  Here's hoping Shadowlands returns a bit more to form
04-01-2020T15:32:56,CrimsonQuill,And basically every videogame ever that I have given that I only started really at them three years ago
04-01-2020T15:33:25,AspiringNoodle,Legion / BFA have been a bit too grindy.  And Blizzard puts in so much repeatable content and locks a lot of stuff behind that
04-01-2020T15:33:29,TeapotOfDoom,i dismantled my ceiling light...
04-01-2020T15:33:45,AspiringNoodle,At least BFA finally put a cap on certain grinds
04-01-2020T15:34:05,CrimsonQuill,@TeapotOfDoom How?
04-01-2020T15:34:14,TeapotOfDoom,screwdriver
04-01-2020T15:34:29,CrimsonQuill,Everything is possible with screwdrivers!
04-01-2020T15:34:39,TeapotOfDoom,15 screws to be exact
04-01-2020T15:35:13,TeapotOfDoom,it pissed me off so i took it appart
04-01-2020T15:35:27,CrimsonQuill,"Caboose: ""I thought I was the constant source of disappointment. Well I WILL HAVE TO TRY HARDER! SOMEBODY GET ME A SCREWDRIVER!"""
04-01-2020T15:35:40,CrimsonQuill,*Cue Offscreen laughter from the rest of the RvB cast*
04-01-2020T15:36:53,TeapotOfDoom,i have one of these lights with a remote. it's not a smart light by any means tho.
04-01-2020T15:37:14,CrimsonQuill,Wheesh.
04-01-2020T15:38:08,TeapotOfDoom,"pretty handy turning it off from bed. problem is once it's turned off by remote, it does not turn on again using the switch. i wanna see if i can reprogram the microcontroller to adjust some settings to my liking"
04-01-2020T15:38:54,CrimsonQuill,"Heh, I wouldn't have a clue how to do that..."
04-01-2020T15:38:57,TeapotOfDoom,it has a cold and a warm light setting and cold is default which is annoying and the switch thing
04-01-2020T15:39:19,CrimsonQuill,I kinda like cold light sometimes
04-01-2020T15:39:25,CrimsonQuill,Makes a space seem bigger
04-01-2020T15:39:38,TeapotOfDoom,once i figure out how the controller works it will actually be quite easy
04-01-2020T15:39:57,TeapotOfDoom,yeah but cold light in a bedroom? not a fan
04-01-2020T15:40:21,CrimsonQuill,Umm
04-01-2020T15:40:24,CrimsonQuill,Ok
04-01-2020T15:40:54,TeapotOfDoom,the controller unit is as simple as it gets actually. i think it works with puls width modulation but i can only be sure once i measured it
04-01-2020T15:41:10,TeapotOfDoom,*pulse
04-01-2020T15:41:19,CrimsonQuill,Cool.
04-01-2020T15:41:39,CrimsonQuill,"Oh my God, thank you"
04-01-2020T15:42:02,TeapotOfDoom,i dunno why i still know but i do so here ya go xD
04-01-2020T15:42:38,CrimsonQuill,xd
04-01-2020T15:42:40,CrimsonQuill,XD
04-01-2020T15:44:19,TeapotOfDoom,send me the article once you're done xD i had an argument at one point and i threw in that i was an scp
04-01-2020T15:44:37,CrimsonQuill,"Oh, heck yes"
04-01-2020T15:44:51,CrimsonQuill,Anyway
04-01-2020T15:44:54,CrimsonQuill,I'm going to shower
04-01-2020T15:45:05,TeapotOfDoom,cya!

04-01-2020T17:40:39,Katfeathers,itchy is just a phase that shaving makes you repeat

04-01-2020T17:41:32,TeapotOfDoom,no itching since i got it. i love it to bits
04-01-2020T17:41:34,TeapotOfDoom,tell me
04-01-2020T17:41:48,Katfeathers,the right shampoo is better than shaving
04-01-2020T17:41:49,ThingsAreMoving,When you remove facial hair with a hair removing creme it doesn't itch when it's growing back
04-01-2020T17:41:56,ThingsAreMoving,cream*
04-01-2020T17:42:16,ThingsAreMoving,cause the tips aren't sharp and don't irritate your skin
04-01-2020T17:42:18,TeapotOfDoom,that's the stuff that makes the hair fall out right?
04-01-2020T17:42:19,BadFoMo,I was thinking of waxing the beard off.
04-01-2020T17:42:23,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-zenshocked:*[such wisdom]
04-01-2020T17:42:36,TeapotOfDoom,waxing? in the face? sounds brutal
04-01-2020T17:42:38,ThingsAreMoving,I think it dissolves the hair at the base
04-01-2020T17:42:41,ThingsAreMoving,Not waxing
04-01-2020T17:43:18,SpazztasticKiwi,hair removal cream would do but you must know what you’re doing
04-01-2020T17:43:31,TeapotOfDoom,suddenly: boldness
04-01-2020T17:43:36,steelabjur,Interesting. One of my girl's major complaints about shaving is the itching.
04-01-2020T17:43:56,SpazztasticKiwi,"obviously, it’s using chemicals to remove the hair, so if you leave it on too long or use too much, you can give yourself chemical burns"
04-01-2020T17:44:08,CrRAR,owie
04-01-2020T17:44:13,IronHorseComics,I tried finding that stuff for men at a walmart as they do exist but I couldn't find one
04-01-2020T17:44:32,IronHorseComics,all I could find was the one for women's legs
04-01-2020T17:44:36,Dimensional,"That's not a beard he's growing, btw... That's the prelude to a muzzle. XD"
04-01-2020T17:44:46,ThingsAreMoving,"I used Nad's For Men Hair Removal Cream, (had to look it up in my purchase history). And I can recommend it wholeheartedly"

04-01-2020T19:57:50,AspiringNoodle,Tom needs sleep.  He started late after a nap and only got about 2 hours of sleep total
04-01-2020T19:57:57,AspiringNoodle,And now he's sleeping (I presume)
04-01-2020T20:02:18,SpazztasticKiwi,in theory
04-01-2020T20:02:42,Combak,"Aww, I missed it."
04-01-2020T20:02:48,Combak,... By quite a bit.
04-01-2020T20:32:23,JojoF2415,I missed it
04-01-2020T20:33:15,JojoF2415,I was working on some digital art.
04-01-2020T20:39:37,Mippy,"Oh, Tom went sleep. Did he get through everything or are we getting some surprise TOm Picks?"
04-01-2020T20:43:17,AspiringNoodle,Probably surprise :P
04-01-2020T20:44:02,ContagiousBordem16,Damnit

04-01-2020T20:51:11,AspiringNoodle,*realizes he forgot to log into EGS after building new computer*
04-01-2020T20:51:17,AspiringNoodle,*has probably missed months of free games*

04-01-2020T22:36:06,AspiringNoodle,I am now*
04-01-2020T22:38:53,Dadrobit,Howdy y'all.
04-01-2020T22:38:59,Dadrobit,Just got back from Cats.
04-01-2020T22:39:11,Dadrobit,Fucking horrifying.
04-01-2020T22:39:20,Dadrobit,I loved every uncomfortable second.
04-01-2020T22:39:42,Dadrobit,Literally two hours of uncanny valley animation.
04-01-2020T22:40:07,Dadrobit,"But from the perspective of the musical, it was fantastic."
04-01-2020T22:43:42,AspiringNoodle,"I more or less analyzed the CG from trailers and screenshots, and more or less the problem is this"
04-01-2020T22:44:04,AspiringNoodle,"Too cartoony.  Naked, fur-covered, with featureless crotches and overall humanoid shape"
04-01-2020T22:44:30,AspiringNoodle,"And the faces are in a god forsaken weird place of trying to be both cat and human at the same time, but not doing far enough one way or the other"
04-01-2020T22:45:28,AspiringNoodle,The Sisters of Plenitude from Doctor Who look less creepy.
04-01-2020T22:47:05,AspiringNoodle,"Dadro, do you agree with this Rotten Tomatoes summation of opinions?"
04-01-2020T22:47:08,AspiringNoodle,"""Despite its fur-midable cast, this Cats adaptation is a clawful mistake that will leave most viewers begging to be put out of their mew-sery."""
04-01-2020T23:45:27,AspiringNoodle,"Wherefore art thou, snow? :ptv-whiny:"
