02-11-2020T01:21:40,SpazztasticKiwi,https://youtu.be/FkGK7bitav0
02-11-2020T01:28:24,Dadrobit,"Yeah, saw that the other day, spazz. Was surprised Abe didn't show up in this one."
02-11-2020T01:29:19,Dadrobit,The way they made Biden kinda soft spoken kinda reminds me of the oppenheimer vs thanos one they did.
02-11-2020T01:30:33,Dadrobit,https://youtu.be/v1vXC-vKgKg
02-11-2020T01:35:34,SpazztasticKiwi,sweet Jesus the last line killed me
02-11-2020T01:35:59,SpazztasticKiwi,I wasn’t as into the thanos one
02-11-2020T01:36:25,SpazztasticKiwi,have you seen rick grimes vs walter white
02-11-2020T01:37:24,Dadrobit,"I think so, that was the walking dead cop right?"
02-11-2020T01:41:00,SpazztasticKiwi,yeah
02-11-2020T01:41:24,SpazztasticKiwi,“noone saw Shane coming....except for your wife”

02-11-2020T01:42:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Mozart vs skrillex is a favorite
02-11-2020T01:50:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I notice they had snoop dog for the moses vs santa
02-11-2020T01:51:22,SpazztasticKiwi,jobs vs gates 👌🏻
02-11-2020T02:02:20,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I remember snoop dogg. In the behind the scenes shooting, snoop said he only agreed to do it because he gave their content a watch and realized they were the real deal. Big props."
02-11-2020T02:08:19,CrRAR,Wow there is such a variety of characters in these haha
02-11-2020T02:08:35,CrRAR,Would never have expected some of the matchups
02-11-2020T02:09:36,CrRAR,Oppoenheimer was cool cuz of how they made it sound radioy and his delivery is perfect just like the recordings you hear of him.
